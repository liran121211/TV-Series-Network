1
00:00:01,584 --> 00:00:04,087
MAL:
Here's how it is. The Earth got used up.

2
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:08,258
So, we moved out and terraformed
a whole new galaxy of Earths.

3
00:00:08,383 --> 00:00:10,719
Some, rich and flush
with the new technologies,

4
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:12,762
some, not so much.

5
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:16,641
The Central Planets,
thems formed the Alliance,

6
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:19,561
waged war to bring everyone
under their rule.

7
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:23,231
A few idiots tried to fight it.
Among 'em, myself.

8
00:00:23,314 --> 00:00:25,734
I'm Malcolm Reynolds,
captain of Serenity.

9
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,153
She's a transport ship,
Firefly class.

10
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:32,323
Got a good crew--
Fighters, pilot, mechanic.

11
00:00:32,407 --> 00:00:34,367
We even picked up a preacher
for some reason...

12
00:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,244
and a bona fide companion.

13
00:00:36,327 --> 00:00:37,370
There's a doctor too,

14
00:00:37,454 --> 00:00:40,040
took his genius sister
out of some Alliance camp.

15
00:00:40,123 --> 00:00:43,418
So, they're keepin' a low profile.
You understand.

16
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,879
You got a job, we can do it.

17
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,131
Don't much care what it is.

18
00:00:51,843 --> 00:00:53,136
BOOK:
Previously--

19
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,304
What are we doing?

20
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:56,181
Oh, crime.

21
00:00:57,891 --> 00:00:58,975
Crime.

22
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,352
When a man engages
in clandestine dealings,

23
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:03,605
he has this preference
for things bein' smooth.

24
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:06,357
(screams) No! No, I don't want to
River!

25
00:01:07,567 --> 00:01:09,194
She makes things not be smooth.

26
00:01:09,277 --> 00:01:10,904
SIMON:
I have no idea what'll set her off.

27
00:01:10,987 --> 00:01:13,573
Just 'cause Mal says you're medic,
don't make you part of the crew.

28
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:16,868
You just play at figurin' what's wrong
with that moon-brained sister of yours--

29
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,369
How is she?

30
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:21,539
She still won't talk about what it was
they did to her at the academy.

31
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:25,335
Two by two, hands of blue.

32
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:29,339
We're looking for a girl--
This girl.

33
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,216
RIVER:
They'll never stop.

34
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:34,344
They'll just keep coming until
they get back what you took.

35
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:36,930
If they find us, they'll send River
back to that place.

36
00:01:37,013 --> 00:01:38,098
I'd never see her again.

37
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,683
You gave up everything you had to find me.

38
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:45,396
You found me broken.
It's hard for you.

39
00:01:59,327 --> 00:02:01,287
I don't want it.

40
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,414
River, you have to eat.

41
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:04,999
It's good. It tastes like--

42
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,170
It's good.
It smells like crotch.

43
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,132
Jayne!
Well, it does.

44
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:15,093
We don't even have to go
someplace fancy.

45
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,095
We can just go
to the park or something.

46
00:02:17,345 --> 00:02:20,348
Feed the pigeons.
Sure. Feed the pigeons,

47
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,767
probably get the firing squad
for littering.

48
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:25,061
Come on.
It's not that bad.

49
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:28,273
It is. It's a core planet.
It's spotless. It's got sensors.

50
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:30,150
And where there ain't sensors,
there's feds.

51
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,901
All central planets are the same.

52
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:36,364
Could you please tell my wife
the fun she's missing out on?

53
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:39,284
Ariel's quite a nice place, actually.

54
00:02:39,784 --> 00:02:41,452
There are some beautiful
museums, not to mention...

55
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:43,371
some of the finest restaurants
in the core.

56
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:46,416
But... not boring,
like she made it sound.

57
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:47,500
There's a, uh,

58
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:48,835
uh--

59
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,298
There's hiking.
WASH: Yeah.

60
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:56,843
And you can go swimming in
a bioluminescent lake.

61
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,636
I don't care if it's got sunsets
24 hours a day.

62
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,388
I ain't setting foot on that planet.

63
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,432
No one is setting foot on that fancy rock.

64
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:03,892
I don't want anyone leaving the ship.

65
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:05,894
Come to think of it,

66
00:03:05,977 --> 00:03:08,646
I don't want anyone looking
out the windows... or talking aloud.

67
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,857
We're here to drop off Inara.
That's it.

68
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:14,319
What's the point of coming to the core
if I can't even step off the boat?

69
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:17,697
You could have got off with Shepherd Book
at the Bathgate Abbey.

70
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:21,743
Could've been meditating on the wonders
of your rock garden by now.

71
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:24,495
Well, it beats just sitting.

72
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,415
It is just sitting.

73
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:29,375
ZOE: So how long are you
gonna be planet-side?

74
00:03:29,834 --> 00:03:31,753
INARA:
Shouldn't be more than a day or two.

75
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,339
WASH: Big stop just to renew
your license to Companion.

76
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:38,259
Can I use "Companion" as a verb?
It's guild law.

77
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:41,846
All Companions are required to undergo
a physical examination once a year.

78
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,057
(hawking)

79
00:03:45,433 --> 00:03:49,687
Could you not do that while we're--ever?

80
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:55,985
WASH: So two days in a hospital.
That's awful.

81
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,571
Don't you just hate doctors?
Hey.

82
00:03:58,655 --> 00:04:00,865
WASH:
I mean, present company excluded.

83
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:04,661
Let's not be excluding people.
That'd be rude.

84
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,206
(groaning) Son of a--

85
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,041
SIMON: What the hell?

86
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,586
River, no.
Oh, my God. He's bleeding.

87
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:15,505
That's deep.
Are you okay?

88
00:04:15,588 --> 00:04:19,175
River.
(groans, breathing heavily)

89
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,551
He looks better in red.

90
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:23,221
(groaning continues)

91
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,393
(inhaling sharply)

92
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,812
Gorram freak's completely off her axle.

93
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,064
I'm sorry about this. I don't know what--

94
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,275
Shut it. I ain't talking to you.

95
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,402
She gotta go.
Both of them gotta go.

96
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,153
Ariel's as good a place as any
to leave them.

97
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,155
Might even pick us up a reward
for our troubles.

98
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,324
No one's getting left.

99
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,410
She belongs in a bughouse.

100
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:47,704
You don't pitch her off this boat
right now, I swear to you--

101
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:50,832
What?
What do you swear, Jayne?

102
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:55,253
They don't get gone, you better start
locking up your room at night.

103
00:04:55,586 --> 00:04:58,256
Next time little sister
gets in a murdering mood,

104
00:04:58,339 --> 00:05:00,091
it might be you she comes calling on.

105
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:02,510
Maybe Kaylee or Inara.

106
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,138
You let them stay,
we're gonna find out.

107
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,101
Finish your work, Doctor.

108
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,813
This is my boat.
They're part of my crew.

109
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:16,357
No one's getting left.
Best you get used to that.

110
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,655
You owe me a shirt.

111
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,953
She's to stay confined to her room
at all times. No exceptions.

112
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:30,663
Take her to the kitchen,
the infirmary, whatever,

113
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:33,624
you ask me first, understand?
I do.

114
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:37,295
When I took you and your sister in,
the deal was you keep her in check.

115
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:41,174
You can't hold up your end,
we're gonna have to revisit the deal.

116
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:48,556
She's getting worse.
Isn't she?

117
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,894
Yes.

118
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:07,200
Just look at the bright side.

119
00:06:07,283 --> 00:06:10,119
Maybe you'll meet a young,
handsome doctor.

120
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,789
He'll ask you out, and--

121
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,124
What's the Companion policy on dating?

122
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,794
It's complicated.
Hmm.

123
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,713
Well, that figures.
Stay out of trouble.

124
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,174
You too. Bye.

125
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:27,595
JAYNE: (grunts)

126
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:30,390
How are we gonna find a job
if we don't leave the ship?

127
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:33,684
Alliance territory--
ain't any jobs worth having.

128
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:36,771
Or the last three places we've been.

129
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:39,023
My pop always said,

130
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,692
"Anyone who can't find work
ain't lookin' hard enough."

131
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:45,696
We ain't even lookin' at all.
SIMON: You can stop looking.

132
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:48,783
There's a client.

133
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:51,119
Me.

134
00:06:51,702 --> 00:06:53,204
I have a job for you.

135
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,708

136
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:01,170

146
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,718
You've got a job for us?

147
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:50,720
One that'll pay for itself ten times over.

148
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,222
WASH: Forget it. We ain't that desperate.

149
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:54,807
Do you know what this is?

150
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:57,351
It's a common immune booster
called isoprobyline.

151
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,313
Street value for a dosage this size--

152
00:08:00,396 --> 00:08:03,608
50 platinum, maybe 20 credits.

153
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:06,569
Propoxyn. Maybe 80.

154
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:09,947
Hydrozopan, 200.

155
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,410
And these are just from the med kit
I had with me when I came on board.

156
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,330
At a hospital like the one
in Ariel City...

157
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,582
they'll have shelves of that stuff.

158
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,417
Whatever the take,

159
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,711
it's more than enough payment
for what I have in mind.

160
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:26,088
So the med vault isn't the job?

161
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,132
SIMON:
That's the payment.

162
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:32,261
I tell you how to get in, get out,
and what's worth taking...

163
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,181
if you help me get River into
the hospital's diagnostic ward.

164
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:39,060
MAL: What's in the diagnostic ward?
A 3 D neuro imager.

165
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:41,312
If I can get River in there,
I might be able to figure out

166
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:42,730
what they did to her at the academy.

167
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:44,774
So we get you and your sister
into the "whatcha" thing...

168
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:46,817
and you tell us how to clean out
the hospital.

169
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,695
Yes.
Not to be negative...

170
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,532
but don't the hospital need that medicine?

171
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:54,158
Government-run facility.

172
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,952
They'd be restocked in a matter of hours.

173
00:08:56,035 --> 00:08:57,995
She's right. They'll never miss it.

174
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:00,206
Plus, folks on the rim sure could use it.

175
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,252
It's all very sweet stealing from
the rich, selling to the poor.

176
00:09:04,335 --> 00:09:07,463
But you're talking about breaking into
a highly secure Alliance facility.

177
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,507
How do you plan on
getting around security?

178
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,135
It's not easy...
but it can be done.

179
00:09:16,764 --> 00:09:18,766
You see, like all core hospitals...

180
00:09:18,849 --> 00:09:21,602
St. Lucy's has its own
dedicated security force--

181
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:27,733
a small batter of local Alliance
federals substationed here.

182
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:30,403
Every floor, every doorway...

183
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:31,529
is equipped with sensors.
(beeping)

184
00:09:31,612 --> 00:09:34,824
And at all points of entry,
patient ident scans.

185
00:09:35,283 --> 00:09:37,285
However, once clear
of those checkpoints...

186
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:40,663
movement within the facility itself
should be relatively unhindered.

187
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,082
The standard layout
should put the med vaults--

188
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:44,875
Go back to the ident scans.

189
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:46,794
You and your sister are tagged fugitives.

190
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:48,879
How do you figure we're
gonna get you in the building?

191
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,298
Through the front door.

192
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,884
Believe me, Captain, getting the two
of us in is going to be easy.

193
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:58,306
The rest of you--
that is going to be the real trick.

194
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:03,811
We'll need to procure a few items
off-ship. I've made a list.

195
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:07,815
Given my status as a fugitive,
someone else will have to--

196
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,152
We have some volunteers. Good.

197
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,362
Before we ever make it to the front door,

198
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,406
we're going to have
to breach the perimeter.

199
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:19,744
Only official vehicles are allowed in,
so we'll need one.

200
00:10:20,703 --> 00:10:22,997
Now obviously we can't steal
what we need.

201
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,749
Any illegal activity
in the planning stages...

202
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:26,751
could end this thing before it starts.

203
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:29,920
St. Lucy's Hospital contracts
with the local municipal dump yard...

204
00:10:30,004 --> 00:10:31,714
for all its large disposals.

205
00:10:33,924 --> 00:10:35,384
It figures.

206
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,262
First time on the core,
and what do I get to do?

207
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:39,722
Dig through trash.

208
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,808
Couldn't he send me shopping
at the Triplex or--

209
00:10:43,476 --> 00:10:46,228
Ooh! Synchronizers!

210
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,439
SIMON:
Big hospitals mean big waste,

211
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:51,359
so we shouldn't have any trouble
finding what we're looking for.

212
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,532
(laughing)

213
00:11:01,118 --> 00:11:03,371
We'll have to look like we belong.

214
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,998
(beeps)

215
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:21,138
All we have to do is slip
a couple of bills into the right hands.

216
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:24,350
That gets us uniforms,
I.D. badges and key cards.

217
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,646
A little creative forgery,
and we've got ourselves a working alias.

218
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:35,820
Now, all these items are easy to obtain.

219
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:38,948
They'll get us up to the door.

220
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,450
Now, in order to get us in--

221
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:43,119
Patients were cynical,

222
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:45,121
and not responding,
and we couldn't bring 'em back.

223
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,956
They were cyanotic--
They were cyanotic--

224
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,666
And not responsive--
Responsive--

225
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,459
And we were unable to

226
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,420
Resuscitate them.
ZOE: Yes.

227
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:54,088
Resuscitate.
Resuscitate them.

228
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:56,298
Good. Which methods did you use?

229
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:58,175
We tried pulmonary stimulators...

230
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:01,220
and--and cardiac--
We--

231
00:12:01,387 --> 00:12:02,763
Infusers.
Infusers.

232
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:05,015
Pulmonary stim
Pulmonary stimulators

233
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:08,269
And cardiac infusers.
What about cortical electrodes?

234
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:12,148
Oh. We forgot 'em.

235
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,359
Let's try that again.
Yeah.

236
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:24,034
Pupils were fixed and dilapidated.
Dilated.

237
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,745
Dilated! Dilated!
(pounding table)

238
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:27,788
(speaking Chinese)
Shiny.

239
00:12:40,801 --> 00:12:43,345
We got there,
and the patients were cyanotic.

240
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,638
Not responding.
Not responsive.

241
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,098
And we tried to resuscitate them--

242
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,934
And despite our best efforts, they kicked.

243
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:51,395
Despite our best efforts...
they--

244
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,646
Which methods did you use?

245
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,899
We tried pulmonary stimulators...

246
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:56,525
and cardiac infusers.

247
00:12:56,859 --> 00:12:58,569
What about the cortical electrodes?

248
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,489
What is that?

249
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:03,574
We--We applied the cortical electrodes.

250
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:06,368
Yep, we used them electromagnetic--

251
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,871
Reaction from--
We were unable to get a neural--

252
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,164
We applied the cortical electrodes

253
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,208
but were unable to get
a neural reaction from either--

254
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,836
Unable to get a neural--
Response.

255
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,213
Response. Hell, I don't know.

256
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:19,215
If I'd wanted schooling,
I'd have gone to school.

257
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,301
I'll get it.

258
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:30,559
That's amazing.

259
00:13:30,935 --> 00:13:33,354
You two did an incredible job.

260
00:13:33,437 --> 00:13:35,940
And now for the finishing touch.

261
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,701
If I didn't know better, I'd say
you're ready to save some lives.

262
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:51,664
All we need are a couple of patients.
Corpses, actually.

263
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:53,666
For this to work,
River and I will have to be dead.

264
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,335
Huh, I'm starting to like this plan.

265
00:13:58,087 --> 00:14:00,381
We're going to be asleep.

266
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:03,133
Captain Reynolds and the others
will have to pretend we're dead

267
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,301
to sneak us into the hospital.

268
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:06,887
Once we're inside,
we'll wake up.

269
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,764
Everything will be fine.

270
00:14:09,807 --> 00:14:11,809
You understand?

271
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:16,146
You're going to suspend cerebral, cardiac
and pulmonary activity...

272
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:18,732
in order to induce
a proto-comatose state.

273
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,653
That's right.
I don't wanna do it.

274
00:14:22,736 --> 00:14:25,239
I know.
I don't wanna go to that place.

275
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:28,409
I don't wanna die.
No. No one is going to die.

276
00:14:28,492 --> 00:14:29,535
It's okay.

277
00:14:29,618 --> 00:14:31,161
The others will take care of us
while we're asleep.

278
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:32,246
And when we get back--

279
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,914
No. Shh-shh-shh.
(whimpering)

280
00:14:33,998 --> 00:14:38,335
River. River, it's okay.
It's okay. This--

281
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,881
This could be
what we've been hoping for.

282
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:45,175
When this is over,
I'll be able to help you.

283
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,554
I'll be able to make
the nightmares go away.

284
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,933
Okay?

285
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:56,270
Okay.
Okay.

286
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,316
All right. Lie back.

287
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:14,705
It's time to go to sleep.

288
00:15:27,676 --> 00:15:29,553
We speak only when spoken to.

289
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,263
We avoid all unecessary contact

290
00:15:31,347 --> 00:15:33,682
and we stay together until
we reach the morgue. Understood?

291
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:35,434
Yes, sir.
Apply the cortical electrode--

292
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:37,061
Jayne?
Unable to get a neural--

293
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:38,520
Yeah, yeah, I got it. I got it.

294
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:40,314
Are we gonna have a problem?

295
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,650
I know what I gotta do.
Not what I'm talking about.

296
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,360
Am I gonna have a problem
with you and Simon?

297
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:46,445
It's up to him.

298
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,530
Look, you got a little
stabbed the other day.

299
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:51,075
It's bound to make anyone
a mite ornery. So I figure--

300
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,786
It's a good plan.
What?

301
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:55,788
The doc did good coming up with that job.

302
00:15:55,871 --> 00:15:57,247
Don't mean I like him any better.

303
00:15:57,331 --> 00:15:59,291
Nothing buys bygones quicker than cash.

304
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,669
Maybe I'll give him
a tattoo while he's out.

305
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,880
Let him do his thing, and you get him out.
No messing with him.

306
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:06,298
Don't worry about me.

307
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,051
As long as I get paid,
I'm happy.

308
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:12,930
Applied the cortical electrodes.
Unable to get a neural response.

309
00:16:13,013 --> 00:16:14,431
Applied the cortical electrodes--

310
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:45,963
We've only got a few hours left
before the morning shift.

311
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:48,132
Won't be an hour.

312
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:00,185
WOMAN: (over p.a., indistinct)

313
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,068
What do you got?
Got a couple D.O.A.s.

314
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,195
By the time we got there--
Take them down to the morgue.

315
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,284
We applied the cortical electrodes,
but were unable to get...

316
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,494
a neural reaction from either patient.

317
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,316
That should bring them
out of it in a few minutes.

318
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,860
Once they're up,
get them to the imaging suite,

319
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:53,405
let Simon do his thing,
then haul it back to the rendezvous.

320
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:57,367
Fifty minutes.
JAYNE: Got it.

321
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:01,497
I'll just... sit right here.

322
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,169
(door closes)

323
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,548
(sighs)

324
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,139
(people chattering)

325
00:18:24,436 --> 00:18:26,230
WOMAN: (over p.a., indistinct)

326
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,690
(indistinct)

327
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:38,534
Ni hao?
I'm in.

328
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:40,744
Do you have the fugitives?

329
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:41,995
You got my reward?

330
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,790
Yes. Just like we talked about.

331
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,166
Then I got your fugitives.

332
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,127
Good.
We'll see you shortly.

333
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:52,256
Congratulations.
You are about to become a very rich man.

334
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:06,687
WOMAN: (over p.a., indistinct)

335
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:16,238
Copper for a kiss.
Jesus!

336
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,992
What did you say?

337
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:22,578
(coughing)

338
00:19:25,581 --> 00:19:29,668
What the hell's the matter with you?
(coughing continues)

339
00:19:30,043 --> 00:19:33,130
Nothing. It's just
the aftereffects of the drugs.

340
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,090
I'll be fine.
Just give me a second.

341
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,843
Well, your sister seems okay.

342
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:41,763
(vomiting)

343
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:46,059
You gotta get dressed.
We gotta move.

344
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,812
Two lefts, two rights,
and we're there.

345
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:49,980
You see anyone, smile.

346
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:51,773
I don't think anybody
smiles in hospitals.

347
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,692
Of course they do. It's a core.
Everyone's rich and happy here.

348
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,819
Why wouldn't they smile?

349
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,864
Excuse me. Excuse me!

350
00:19:58,947 --> 00:19:59,990
Hi.

351
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,700
Where are you taking those bodies?

352
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:04,203
Just downstairs to the morgue.
Downstairs is that way.

353
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,873
Right. Must've gotten turned around.

354
00:20:09,499 --> 00:20:11,543
Let me see your badge.

355
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:15,923
You're doing it backwards.

356
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,300
Walking up the down slide.

357
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,844
(whispers)
Keep her quiet.

358
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:23,513
This is the recovery ward.

359
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:25,849
This is where patients come to get better.

360
00:20:26,308 --> 00:20:27,476
They're going to die.

361
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,977
No one is going to die.

362
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:31,688
He is.
No, he's not.

363
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,483
That man standing next to him
is his doctor.

364
00:20:34,691 --> 00:20:35,692
He's going to help him.

365
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,903
He's not going to help him right.

366
00:20:37,986 --> 00:20:39,071
River, the doctors here...

367
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:41,573
are the best in the system.
(monitor beeping)

368
00:20:41,657 --> 00:20:44,868
This is one of the top hospitals
in the core or anywhere else.

369
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:47,162
Where you should be.
(beeping increases)

370
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,874
You have to help him.
River, we don't have time.

371
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,126
He's killing him!
DOCTOR: Code blue!

372
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,253
We got a code. Here.

373
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,506
Stay here.
Don't move!

374
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,472
What do we have?
A 42-year-old double bypass, post-op.

375
00:21:05,555 --> 00:21:06,556
Prognosis was positive.

376
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,643
B.P.'s 60 over 20. Pulse is thready.
Who are you?

377
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:10,936
NURSE: He's crashing.
Get the cart.

378
00:21:12,396 --> 00:21:14,314
We have flatline.
We've gotta crack him.

379
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,899
We're not cracking a post op.

380
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,693
He's nonresponsive.
Should I call the code team?

381
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:20,570
Get the infusions and .4 of atropine.
What did you give him?

382
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,864
Just 20 of apresaline push.

383
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,119
Clear.

384
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,791
Clear.
NURSE: Clear.

385
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:36,962
He's going tachy.
Yeah, but his heart's beating.

386
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:39,423
(patient moaning)
(rapid beeping)

387
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,889
(beeping slows)

388
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,850
He's okay.

389
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:55,147
Explain to me how you justify

390
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:57,232
administering a vasoconstrictor
to this patient.

391
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:01,236
Apresaline is a painkiller--
Unless you combine it with dilaftin.

392
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,823
Which any first year should know
is the standard prep medicine...

393
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,783
your patient was taking
before his surgery.

394
00:22:07,659 --> 00:22:09,286
Your patient should be dead.

395
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,587
Let's go.

396
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:21,798
Walk with me a minute.

397
00:22:21,882 --> 00:22:22,924
MAL: Where are we going?

398
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,092
You see this badge?

399
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,845
It says "doctor."
I say walk, you walk.

400
00:22:26,928 --> 00:22:28,388
Yeah, but where are we going?

401
00:22:28,472 --> 00:22:30,640
You must be new.
Don't get comfortable.

402
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,393
Your type doesn't last long here.
When your supervisor...

403
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,395
hears about the rude and dis--
(screams)

404
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,816
Clear.

405
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:51,078
Ready?

406
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,925
1205. Here it is.

407
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,847
(beeping)

408
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:13,266
Zoe.

409
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:18,814
Must've been demagged.

410
00:23:46,675 --> 00:23:49,052
(electronic hum)

411
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:03,084
WOMAN: (over p.a., indistinct)

412
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,218
(beeping)

413
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:20,352
They opened up her skull.

414
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:23,730
That's a scalpel scar.
They--

415
00:25:23,813 --> 00:25:26,024
They opened up her skull,
and they cut into her brain.

416
00:25:29,152 --> 00:25:30,487
Why?

417
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,198
The only reason to make an
incision in someone's brain is...

418
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:35,700
to lobotomize them-- to go in
and remove damaged tissue.

419
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:39,704
Why... anyone would cut
into a healthy brain is--

420
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:44,876
They did it over and over.

421
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:50,423
They stripped her amygdala.

422
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:53,176
Her what?

423
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,427
You know, uh--

424
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:57,639
You know how you get...
scared or...

425
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,684
or worried or nervous,
but you don't want to be scared...

426
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:03,270
or worried or nervous,
so you push it to the back of your mind.

427
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,813
You try not to think about it.

428
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,774
Your amygdala is what lets you do that.
It's like...

429
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,611
a filter in your brain that
keeps your feelings in check.

430
00:26:15,073 --> 00:26:18,577
She feels everything.
She can't not.

431
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,371
That's fascinating.
Let's get moving.

432
00:26:22,372 --> 00:26:25,000
We still have 20 minutes.
Wrong. Plan changed when you were out.

433
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:26,334
We're meeting out the back way in five.

434
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:31,006
I could use another couple minutes.
I'm sure if we get in touch with Captain--

435
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:32,841
Captain gave his orders.
We play it by the book.

436
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,010
(screaming)

437
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:38,221
(muffled shouts)

438
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,933
River, shh-shh-shh.
It's okay. It's okay.

439
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,435
Get her in the chair and let's go!

440
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:46,688
Shh!
No! No! No!

441
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,982
They come out of the black.
They come when you call.

442
00:26:49,065 --> 00:26:51,860
River, it's okay.
It's over. We're leaving.

443
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:53,486
Your toes are in the sand.
And your head's up your---

444
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,572
Hey! Back off.

445
00:26:55,905 --> 00:26:57,616
You just make sure
she keeps her mouth shut.

446
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,493
We don't need her screeching while
we're trying to make a quiet getaway.

447
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:02,120
It's okay. It's okay.
(whimpering)

448
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,043
(sighs)

449
00:27:08,668 --> 00:27:10,003
(chattering)

450
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,255
You should've let me know
when the plan changed.

451
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:13,590
I told you when you needed to know.

452
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:15,634
What are you griping about?
You got what you came for.

453
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,185
No, no, I can't go back.
I don't wanna go back.

454
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:26,811
Shh-shh-shh. It's okay.

455
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,730
We're just going back to the ship.

456
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:33,026
We're almost home.
Shh-shh-shh.

457
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,322
Federal marshals!

458
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:39,449
Don't move!
(guns cocking)

459
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:43,703
River and Simon Tam, by the authority
of the Union of Allied Planets,

460
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:46,623
you are hereby bound by law.

461
00:27:53,171 --> 00:27:54,631
Take them to Processing.

462
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,682
So, you gonna take me away
for questioning now?

463
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:05,141
How you gonna play it?

464
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:08,103
You're under arrest for aiding
and abetting federal fugitives.

465
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,230
Better get a lawyer.
You're kidding, right?

466
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:13,525
Where's my ruttin' money?
You mean my money...

467
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,402
for apprehending the three fugitives?

468
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,362
I expect I'll be getting it soon.

469
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:23,243
(groaning)

470
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:38,091
How much did we get?
Enough to keep us flying.

471
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:39,801
Can we fly somewhere with a beach?

472
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:41,428
Maybe a naked beach.

473
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,432
Cut it out. The job's not done
until we're back on Serenity .

474
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:48,309
Sorry, sir. Didn't mean
to enjoy the moment.

475
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:51,229
Where are the others?

476
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,947
(chattering)

477
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:05,076
If those officers hadn't been armed,
I think you'd have had a chance.

478
00:29:06,995 --> 00:29:08,872
A guy shoves me, I shove him.

479
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:11,124
Not like I was trying to mount a rescue.

480
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,794
Still, I appreciate you trying.

481
00:29:15,128 --> 00:29:18,256
You know what I'd appreciate?
You stop flapping that pretty mouth at me.

482
00:29:18,923 --> 00:29:21,426
I'm trying to figure a way out of here.
I can't do it with you yammering.

483
00:29:23,553 --> 00:29:25,472
They took Christmas away.

484
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,182
What the hell now?

485
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,018
I came downstairs for the shiny presents.

486
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:32,979
They took the tree and the stockings.

487
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:37,233
Nothing left but coal.
Would you shut her up?

488
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:41,821
Don't look in the closet either.
It's greedy.

489
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:45,074
It's not in the spirit of the holiday.

490
00:29:47,035 --> 00:29:48,953
You shut the hell up right now,

491
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,956
or so help me, I will shut you up.

492
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:58,713
Time?
Ten minutes past rendezvous.

493
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,548
Something's happened.

494
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,595
Kaylee, are you linked?

495
00:30:05,929 --> 00:30:08,681
Uh, I am... now.
What do you need?

496
00:30:08,890 --> 00:30:11,267
WASH: Find out if there's any kind of
security alert in the hospital.

497
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,685
Hang on.

498
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:16,064
Could be they're just late.
Not this late.

499
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,441
Jayne would've sent up a flag.

500
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:21,319
KAYLEE: Nothing from hospital security,
nothing on the local pipeline either.

501
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:24,155
Although I am getting some weird chatter

502
00:30:24,239 --> 00:30:25,949
from the official 262.
(static, chattering)

503
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:29,744
It sounds like...
they're talking about ducks.

504
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:31,704
Code.
Feds got 'em.

505
00:30:32,455 --> 00:30:34,415
Have her bring up
the hospital schematic.

506
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,793
Find me a way into
that security substation.

507
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:38,753
Wait a minute.

508
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,296
You don't even know for sure
if they're in there.

509
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:43,007
Gonna find out. Check.
Coming in clear.

510
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:48,012
WASH: So, you're just gonna
walk in through the front door?

511
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,640
No. You're gonna find me
a way around back.

512
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:54,143
Get up.
What's going to happen to us?

513
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,604
I said, "Get up."

514
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:01,359
Agent McGuinness, I'm certain
you're working under a superior...

515
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:03,486
who's keeping close tabs on this case.

516
00:31:03,570 --> 00:31:06,197
I'm certain of that because
important people don't do fieldwork.

517
00:31:06,656 --> 00:31:09,993
I'm also quite certain your superior
wants me and my sister alive.

518
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:15,290
Now, I'm not going to move from this spot
until one of two things happens.

519
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:20,670
You answer my very simple question...
or you shoot me.

520
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:27,427
We're transferring you to a holding area
until you can be retrieved.

521
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,054
SIMON: Retrieved? By whom?

522
00:31:30,138 --> 00:31:31,723
MCGUINESS: People who want you alive.

523
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:34,559
People, not me.

524
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:39,105
Take them.

525
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,839
Wash, we could use
a little direction here.

526
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:49,300
Working on it.
Kaylee, what do you got?

527
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:51,636
Tell them to hang a left
when they reach Cryo.

528
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:52,929
They'll see a door.

529
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,977
WASH: (on radio) All right. Go through
that door and down to green level.

530
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,271
This is exactly what I didn't want.

531
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:05,149
I wanted simple. I wanted in and out.
I wanted easy money.

532
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:07,568
Things always get a little more
complicated, don't they, sir?

533
00:33:07,652 --> 00:33:09,696
MAL: Just once I'd like things to go
according to the gorram plan.

534
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,073
WASH: (over radio)
Guys, you might wanna hurry.

535
00:33:12,156 --> 00:33:13,449
Is there a problem?

536
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:21,791
I think the reinforcements
just arrived.

537
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,532
Come on.

538
00:33:58,911 --> 00:33:59,954
What are you doing?

539
00:34:00,538 --> 00:34:01,789
Going out the way we came in.

540
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,708
There are at least four armed
feds out there.

541
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:05,418
Six. I know.

542
00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,379
We run.
You got no idea where that goes .

543
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:11,299
We'll find our way.
I ain't chancing that.

544
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,761
I can handle the feds.
It doesn't matter.

545
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,682
They're here.

546
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,522
Gentlemen, that was prompt.

547
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,566
We're almost finished here.

548
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:30,276
The prisoners
will be out in a minute.

549
00:34:30,777 --> 00:34:33,488
Let me get the paperwork together for you.
Bobby, bring that here.

550
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,991
Not that it'll mean much.

551
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:40,453
The men were tight-lipped.
The girl was just spewing gibberish.

552
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:41,871
We got it all down.

553
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:47,668
You spoke to the prisoners?
Well, yeah.

554
00:34:47,877 --> 00:34:48,878
Had to process them.

555
00:34:50,004 --> 00:34:52,799
There was no interrogation,
if that's what you mean.

556
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,217
Didn't do your job for you.

557
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:56,219
Did your men also speak with them?

558
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,513
Much as they had to.
(electronic humming)

559
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:04,936
(humming intensifies)

560
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:27,792
(men shouting, screaming)

561
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:34,340
What the hell is that?
(shouting, screaming continue)

562
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:50,106
Two by two.
Hands of blue.

563
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:54,402
Two by two. Hands of blue.
(mumbling)

564
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:58,948
(mumbling continues)

565
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:12,378
Where the hell's she going?
Must be some sort of exit this way.

566
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,256
I don't see no exit.

567
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:21,512
Dead.

568
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,806
This one's alive.

569
00:36:25,766 --> 00:36:28,686
I got no intention of running around
like a rat in a maze till we're dead.

570
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:30,354
We're going back.

571
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:33,691
(man screaming)

572
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,082
Almost there.

573
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:55,796
Almost there.
Almost there.

574
00:36:58,841 --> 00:37:00,301
There.

575
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:07,850
Stand back.
Come here.

576
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:15,775
Se-niou!
High-tech Alliance crap!

577
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:31,624
(gunshot)
(screams)

578
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:55,940
Ah, hey there, Inara.
How was your checkup?

579
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:58,484
Same as last year.
What's going on here?

580
00:37:58,567 --> 00:38:00,278
Well, let's see.
We killed Simon and River,

581
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,947
stole a bunch of medicine,
and now the Captain and Zoe

582
00:38:03,030 --> 00:38:05,908
are off springing and the others
got snatched by the feds.

583
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:07,910
(vehicle approaching)
Oh, here they are now.

584
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,509
Tell me we weren't followed.

585
00:38:23,592 --> 00:38:25,469
Nothing in our rearview
the whole way back.

586
00:38:25,553 --> 00:38:26,762
All right.

587
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,347
Take us out of the world quick as you can.

588
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:30,808
We'll be out of atmo in five minutes.

589
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:34,270
Hey. How was your thing?

590
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:37,148
As advertised,
lots of needles and cold exam tables.

591
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:40,609
I heard you had some excitement.
Oh, nothing much.

592
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,445
Lots of running around,
a little gunplay.

593
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,363
A couple needles.

594
00:38:44,905 --> 00:38:47,033
The next time we come to the core,
I'm staying with the preacher.

595
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:50,119
If you hadn't come,
you wouldn't be getting your big payday.

596
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:53,414
So, you get what you needed?

597
00:38:53,497 --> 00:38:54,498
I think I did.

598
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:56,208
I have the information
I downloaded off the imager.

599
00:38:56,292 --> 00:39:00,421
I just have to go over it,
and, uh, I'm hopeful.

600
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:03,424
What happened to your face?
Huh?

601
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:06,969
Oh, uh, nothing.
SIMON: He was amazing.

602
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,096
I can't even begin to tell you.

603
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,807
We wouldn't be standing here
if it weren't for him.

604
00:39:12,725 --> 00:39:16,729
Thank you.
Hey, you're part of my crew.

605
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:19,440
I think I might cry.

606
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,984
All right. Jayne,
help me with the cargo.

607
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,028
Everyone make yourselves useful.

608
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,613
You got jobs.
Go do them.

609
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:30,076
It's gotta be our best take ever.

610
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:33,412
Doc had a good notion.
The boy's got a decent criminal mind.

611
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:38,459
What are you buying with your cut?

612
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:03,192
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

613
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:16,455
The job is done.
I figured it was time for a little chat.

614
00:40:17,998 --> 00:40:19,583
(beeping)

615
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:22,837
(door opening)

616
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:27,925
(grunting)

617
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,930
MAL: (on radio)
Seems to me we had a solid plan.

618
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,640
"Scruth," you might say.

619
00:40:34,723 --> 00:40:36,392
But what I can't figure out

620
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,519
is what you were doing
around the back exit.

621
00:40:39,019 --> 00:40:42,690
What? I couldn't go out the front!

622
00:40:42,773 --> 00:40:45,401
I had to improvise!
Open the damn door!

623
00:40:46,068 --> 00:40:47,736
You called the feds.

624
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,905
What? I got pinched!

625
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,700
Which is what happens
when you call the feds.

626
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:55,828
No, I would never do that!
My hand to God!

627
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:58,789
May he strike me down
as I'm standing here!

628
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:00,624
Well, you won't be
standing there long.

629
00:41:00,708 --> 00:41:01,834
The minute we break atmo,

630
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:04,587
you'll be a lot thinner once
you get sucked out that hole.

631
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,255
Oh, come on, Mal!

632
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:07,673
COMPUTER VOICE:
Leaving atmo in two minutes.

633
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:10,426
That ain't no way for a man to die!
Secure air lock door at once.

634
00:41:10,509 --> 00:41:12,261
(alarm blaring)

635
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:15,931
You wanna kill me, shoot me!
Just let me in!

636
00:41:16,015 --> 00:41:18,934
You know, I hear tell they used to
keelhaul traitors back in the day.

637
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,270
I don't have a keel
to haul you on, so--

638
00:41:21,353 --> 00:41:25,900
Oh, okay.
I'm sorry, all right?

639
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:31,030
Sorry for what, Jayne?
I thought you'd never do such a thing.

640
00:41:32,948 --> 00:41:36,744
Money was too good.
I got stupid.

641
00:41:37,328 --> 00:41:38,496
I'm sorry, okay?

642
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,539
Be reasonable.

643
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,250
What are you taking it
so personal for?

644
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,294
It ain't like I ratted you
out to the feds.

645
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:47,129
But you did!

646
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:50,341
You turn on any of my crew,
you turn on me!

647
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:53,135
But since that's a concept
you can't seem to wrap your head around,

648
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:54,553
then you got no place here.

649
00:41:56,430 --> 00:42:00,684
You did it to me, Jayne.
And that's a fact.

650
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:11,904
What are you gonna tell the others?

651
00:42:11,987 --> 00:42:13,364
About what?

652
00:42:14,114 --> 00:42:15,991
About why I'm dead.

653
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:18,869
I hadn't thought about it.

654
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,915
Make something up.

655
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:25,584
Don't tell them what I did.

656
00:42:36,470 --> 00:42:37,972
(sighing)

657
00:42:38,055 --> 00:42:40,641
The next time you decide
to stab me in the back,

658
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:43,269
have the guts to do it to my face.

659
00:42:56,448 --> 00:42:58,450
Can I come in?

660
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,375
Hi.

661
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,670
What are you doing?

662
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,297
Drawing.

663
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:15,384
That's really good.

664
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:20,264
What are you doing?

665
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:24,393
I, um--
I brought some medicine.

666
00:43:25,853 --> 00:43:27,896
Do you remember why
we went to the hospital?

667
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:30,691
Is it time to go to sleep again?

668
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:34,612
No, mei-mei.

669
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:41,994
It's time to wake up.

670
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:29,958
Grr! Arrgh!
