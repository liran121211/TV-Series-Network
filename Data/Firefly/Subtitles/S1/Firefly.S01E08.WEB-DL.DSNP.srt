00:00:01,126 --> 00:00:03,712
MAL: Here's how it is.
The Earth got used up.

2
00:00:03,712 --> 00:00:06,589
So we terraformed
a whole new galaxy of Earths.

3
00:00:06,589 --> 00:00:08,591
Some, rich and flush
with the new technologies,

4
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:10,593
some, not so much.

5
00:00:10,593 --> 00:00:12,721
The Central Planets,
thems formed the Alliance,

6
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:15,306
waged war to bring everyone
under their rule.

7
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:18,268
A few idiots tried to fight it.
Among 'em, myself.

8
00:00:18,268 --> 00:00:20,729
I'm Malcolm Reynolds,
captain of Serenity.

9
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:24,774
Got a good crew--
Fighters, pilot, mechanic.

10
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:27,569
We even picked up a preacher
and a bona fide companion.

11
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,780
There's a doctor too, took his genius
sister out of some Alliance camp.

12
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,407
So, they're keepin'
a low profile.

13
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:34,200
You got a job, we can do it.

14
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:36,661
Don't much care
what it is.

15
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,469
(equipment beeping)

16
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:18,411
(metal clanks)
(grunts)

17
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:23,208
MAN: A real beauty, ain't she?
Yes, sir.

18
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:27,295
Tell you what. You buy this ship,
treat her proper,

19
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,214
she'll be with you for the rest of your
life.

20
00:01:29,297 --> 00:01:30,340
(door clanks open)

21
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:39,516
Well?

22
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,605
You paid money for this, sir?
On purpose?

23
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:49,567
Wha--Come on, seriously, Zoe,
what do you think?

24
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,987
Honestly, sir?
I think you got robbed.

25
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:56,282
Robbed? Wha--
What do you mean?

26
00:01:56,699 --> 00:01:59,202
It's a piece of fei-oo.
Fei-oo?

27
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:03,331
Uh, okay, she won't be winning any beauty
contests anytime soon, but

28
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:04,707
she is solid.

29
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:08,378
Ship like this, be with you
till the day you die.

30
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,214
Because it's a death trap.
That's not

31
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,801
You are very much lacking
in imagination.

32
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,387
I imagine that's so, sir.
Come on. You haven't even seen most of it.

33
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:21,266
Let me show you the rest, and try
to see past what she is...

34
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,227
and on to what she can be.
What's that, sir?

35
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:26,646
Freedom is what.
I meant what's that?

36
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:30,525
Oh. Yeah, just step around that. I think
something must have been living in here.

37
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:33,486
I tell you, Zoe, we get a mechanic,
get her up and running again,

38
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:36,072
hire a good pilot,
maybe a cook--

39
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:38,408
Live like real people.

40
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:43,746
A small crew--They must feel the need
to be free. Take jobs as they come.

41
00:02:44,747 --> 00:02:47,083
They never have to be under
the heel of nobody ever again.

42
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,336
No matter how long the arm
of the Alliance might get,

43
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:52,881
we'll just get ourselves
a little further.

44
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:56,134
"Get her running again"?
Yeah.

45
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,761
So not running now?
Not so much.

46
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:01,389
Ah.
But she will.

47
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:06,436
I already know what I'm gonna call her.
Got a name all picked out.

48
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,239
(grunts)

49
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,241
(straining)

50
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,744

00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:37,300

(groans)

64
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,304
(laughter)

65
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,057
No!
(laughing)

66
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,436
That is not true. No!

67
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,480
BOOK: I swear it is.
(laughing continues)

68
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:16,816
INARA: Surely one of you
must have told him.

69
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:20,361
No! Not one of the brethren
had the heart to say anything.

70
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:23,573
He was so proud!
(laughing resumes)

71
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,491
Of what?

72
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:28,870
What was he proud of?
Who he?

73
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:32,915
Looked rather natty, truth be told, you
know. (laughing continues)

74
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:33,958
What was natty? I wanna hear

75
00:05:34,042 --> 00:05:35,626
about the natty thing.
Ah.

76
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:38,296
Shepherd Book was just tellin' us
funny stories...

77
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:41,341
about his life at the monastery.

78
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,802
Monastic humor. I miss out on all the fun.
(chuckling)

79
00:05:45,011 --> 00:05:47,388
And all the food too, apparently.

80
00:05:47,388 --> 00:05:51,100
Just who do you think
you're married to, hmm?

81
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:54,270
Voilà! (laughs)
I love my wife.

82
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:56,814
So we got a course set?
We do.

83
00:05:56,898 --> 00:05:59,942
Took a little creative navigating, but we
should make it all the way to Greenleaf...

84
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,028
without running afoul
of any Alliance patrols.

85
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:06,032
Or a single living soul, for that matter.
Good. Way it should be.

86
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:09,660
Course, what should be an
18-hour trip's gonna take us...

87
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:11,245
the better part of a week
by this route.

88
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,499
Oh, we're in no rush. I like an easy,
languorous journey.

89
00:06:14,582 --> 00:06:17,126
Oh, gee, I wonder
what that would be like.

90
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,337
Let me help you
with that.

91
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,673
It's your turn.
My turn?

92
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,386
Well, Shepherd told us a funny story about
being a preacher.

93
00:06:26,636 --> 00:06:29,472
Now you tell us a funny story
about being a doctor.

94
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,183
(chuckling)
Oh, a funny story.

95
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:35,103
Yeah, 'cause sick people
are "high-larious."

96
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,523
Well, they-- they can be. Uh--

97
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:40,691
(chuckles)
Well, uh, in-in fact,

98
00:06:40,775 --> 00:06:46,864
I-I remember this time, uh, I was
working the E.R., and this, uh, this, uh,

99
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:50,326
this fellow-- this, uh, you know,
upright sort of citizen,

100
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,703
he-he comes in and he's,
you know, complaining about--

101
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:57,083
Uh, Inara, she's gotta have some funny
whorin' stories, I'd wager.

102
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,210
(sarcastic chuckle)
Oh, do I ever.

103
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:02,797
Funny and sexy.
You have no idea.

104
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,383
And you never will.
(men chuckling)

105
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,218
I don't discuss my clients.

106
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:09,345
Aw, come on, Inara. Who'd know?

107
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:12,723
You. A Companion
doesn't kiss and tell.

108
00:07:13,349 --> 00:07:16,018
So there is kissin'?

109
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:20,273
Hey, Doc, uh, I think Kaylee may need
your help after all.

110
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:23,192
Care to make the first incision,
Dr. Tam?

111
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:25,653
(all chuckling)
Happy Birthday, Simon.

112
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:27,697
(all congratulating)

113
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,032
Whoo!
This is, uh

114
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,120
How did--
How'd you know?

115
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,330
River, did you?
"Day" is a vestigial mode...

116
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:39,208
of time measurement
based on solar cycles.

117
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:43,463
It's not applicable.
I didn't get you anything.

118
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:48,259
Seems a fresh warrant for your arrest
came up over the cortex.

119
00:07:48,259 --> 00:07:50,553
Had your birth date
attached right to it.

120
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:54,390
(inhales) Really?
I hope you like it.

121
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:58,227
Couldn't get ahold of no flour,
so it's mostly protein.

122
00:07:58,811 --> 00:08:01,355
In fact, it's pretty much what
we just had for dinner.

123
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,733
(laughing)
But I tried to get...

124
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:07,278
the frosting as chocolatey-tasting
as possible, so--

125
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:09,614
Thank you.

126
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:14,911
I'm really, I'm very-- very deeply moved.
Thank you.

127
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:19,373
Well, deeply move yourself to blow out
them candles, so we can try a slice.

128
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:22,043
(laughing)
Come on, Doc. Give a good blow.

129
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,755
(rumbling, whirring)
JAYNE: Hey.

130
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,383
(accelerating whir)
What the hell was that?

131
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:33,429
Maybe just a hiccup.
I'll go check it out.

132
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:36,432
I'll take a look at the helm.
Fire.

133
00:08:36,766 --> 00:08:39,018
Okay, right. (inhales)
(rumbling resumes)

134
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,981
(cries out)
(grunts, groans)

135
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,152
Zoe!
Fire!

136
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:49,445
Fire!

137
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:53,449
(alarm wailing)

138
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,578
Zoe, baby.
You've got to talk to me, baby.

139
00:08:57,662 --> 00:09:00,873
Seal off everything that leads below
decks! Do it now!

140
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:05,503
(alarm wailing,
equipment twittering)

141
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,381
(beeping)
(silence)

142
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:15,263
She gonna be okay?
I need my med kit.

143
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,598
Not this way.
We've got fire.

144
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:24,939
Where do you think you're going?
Zoe's been badly hurt.

145
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:27,733
I need my medical supplies.
Sorry, Doc, nobody leaves.

146
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,151
Everything's sealed up tight.

147
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,028
If you don't let me through,
she could die.

148
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:34,490
I let you through, we all die.

149
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,617
(beeping, whistling)

150
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:40,496
(Klaxon blares)
(steam hissing)

151
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:55,177
(sirens wailing)

152
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:59,599
(air lock sealing)

153
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:03,436
(Klaxon continues)

154
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:06,188
(grunts)

155
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:08,107
(labored breathing)

156
00:10:10,526 --> 00:10:12,028
(groans)

157
00:10:17,908 --> 00:10:19,785
WASH: It's okay. You're gonna be--
She's going into shock.

158
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:22,496
I need to bring her vitals back up.
MAL: How bad is it?

159
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:23,998
She gonna be all right?

160
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:25,666
There's no sign of burning.
It must be internal.

161
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:28,794
I'll have to do a scan.
Baby. Zoe, can you hear me?

162
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,298
Zoe.
Come on, sweetheart.

163
00:10:33,424 --> 00:10:36,719
Zoe. Come on, talk, baby.
Look at me, sweet--

164
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:40,139
Kaylee.
Kaylee, look at me.

165
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:43,517
I need you up in the engine room
figurin' out what caused this.

166
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,228
She ain't movin'.

167
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:53,110
Serenity's not movin'.
I know it.

168
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:55,946
Which is why we need to suss out
what it was happened,

169
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:58,574
so we can
get her goin' again, right?

170
00:10:58,741 --> 00:11:01,327
Think you can do that?
Yes, Captain.

171
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:03,704
That's a good girl.

172
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,919
Come on, baby. You're strong,
strongest person I ever met.

173
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,088
You can do this!
She gonna make it?

174
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:14,715
Please. I need to work.
Wash.

175
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:17,301
Wash, I need you
on the bridge.

176
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,219
Zoe's hurt.

177
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,346
And the doctor is gonna do
everything he can.

178
00:11:20,846 --> 00:11:23,766
Meantime, I got to have you on the bridge.
We need to know how bad it is.

179
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,977
How bad?
It's bad, okay, sir?

180
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:29,730
My wife may be dying here,
so my feeling is it's pretty damn bad.

181
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,775
Wash
I'm not leaving her side, Mal!

182
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,528
Don't ask me again.

183
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,239
I wasn't askin'.
I was tellin'.

184
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,740
(speaking Chinese)

185
00:11:45,788 --> 00:11:48,624
You're gonna get to that bridge, and
you're gonna get us back on our feet.

186
00:11:57,633 --> 00:12:00,928
Yeah.
This is all very doable.

187
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,348
Shouldn't be
a problem at all.

188
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:10,354
A few modifications. Get some real
maneuverability out of this boat.

189
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,233
You'll be surprised.
So you'll take the job then?

190
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:20,281
Might do, might do. Think I'm startin'
to get a feel here.

191
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,534
Good. Well, take your time.
Make yourself at home.

192
00:12:24,535 --> 00:12:27,705
Just, uh, fiddle around with the dials
there. We'll be nearby.

193
00:12:30,207 --> 00:12:31,751
Great, ain't he?
I don't like him.

194
00:12:32,376 --> 00:12:34,712
What?
Just somethin' about him bothers me.

195
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,089
What? What about him bothers you?
I'm not sure.

196
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:40,217
It's... somethin'.
Well, your "somethin'" comes up against...

197
00:12:40,301 --> 00:12:42,553
a list of recommendations
as long as my leg.

198
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,597
Tanaka raves
about this guy.

199
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,849
Renshaw's been tryin' to get him on
his crew for a month.

200
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:50,352
And we need us a pilot.
I understand, sir. He bothers me.

201
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,855
Look, we finally got ourselves
a genius mechanic.

202
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:55,191
It's about time we hired someone to fly
this damn thing.

203
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:59,111
"Genius"? No one's
ever called me that before.

204
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:01,238
Shiny.

205
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,118
He just bothers me.

206
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:09,330
(constant tone)
Her heart stopped.

207
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,874
Maybe someone should get her husband
out here.

208
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,959
No.
What do you need, Doc?

209
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,003
Uh, that drawer.
Right there.

210
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:20,007
That's the one.
INARA: What is it?

211
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,344
Pure adrenaline.
(gasps, weeps)

212
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,179
(bellows)

213
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:29,225
(exhales, inhales sharply)

214
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,191
(rapid breaths)

215
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:47,409
(yells)

216
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:49,787
(strained groan)

217
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,664
(grunts, groans)

218
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,756
Cap?
Is Zoe gonna be okay?

219
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:04,093
You let the doctor
worry about Zoe.

220
00:14:07,721 --> 00:14:08,722
Come on.

221
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,184
Tell me what you know.

222
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:16,355
Catalyzer on the port compression
coil blew. It's where the trouble started.

223
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:18,983
Okay, I need that
in captain dummy-talk, Kaylee.

224
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,777
We're dead in the water.
Can you fix it?

225
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:27,074
I could try. Ju-Just get us to limpin'.
That's all I need.

226
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:33,205
What? What is it?
Well, it's worse than just the coil.

227
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:34,999
How can it be worse?

228
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:38,168
Main life support's down on account of
the engine being dead.

229
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:41,046
Right. But we got auxiliary life support.
No, we don't.

230
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:45,301
Ain't even on.
Explosion must've knocked it out.

231
00:14:45,301 --> 00:14:48,345
So what are we breathin'?
Whatever got pumped into the atmo...

232
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,723
before the explosion
shut it all down.

233
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:54,643
Most of that oxygen got ate up by the fire
on its way out the door.

234
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:58,647
Well, whatever's left is what we got.
How long?

235
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:04,111
A couple of hours, maybe.
We'll start to feel it,

236
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:07,865
and then we won't feel
nothin' at all.

237
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,295
How is she?

238
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,548
She's still unconscious,

239
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:27,551
but her vitals are strong.

240
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,972
She won't know it, but as long as her
condition remains like this,

241
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,766
she'll outlive us all.

242
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,353
She's using less oxygen.

243
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,446
(sighs)

244
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,200
I always thought the name...

245
00:15:51,283 --> 00:15:52,826
Serenity had...

246
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:55,913
a vaguely funereal
sound to it.

247
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,999
I love this ship.

248
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:02,336
I have from the first moment
I saw it.

249
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:04,421
I just don't
want to die on it.

250
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:07,633
I don't want
to die at all.

251
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:12,638
Suffocation's not exactly
the most dignified way to go.

252
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:15,265
(inhales deeply)
The human body will--

253
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:18,644
Please, I don't really require a clinical
description right now.

254
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:21,271
I'm sorry.

255
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,317
I just, uh--

256
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,114
It was my birthday.

257
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:43,711
(sighs)

258
00:16:44,628 --> 00:16:46,547
Don't be afraid.

259
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:52,469
That's what it says:
"Don't be afraid."

260
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,263
Yes.

261
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:56,807
But you are afraid.

262
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,436
Yes.

263
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,564
You're afraid we're
going to run out of air.

264
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:06,025
That we'll die gasping.

265
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,571
But we won't.
That's not going to happen.

266
00:17:14,366 --> 00:17:16,660
We'll freeze to death first.

267
00:17:26,378 --> 00:17:27,755
You get that beacon sent?

268
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:30,549
Yeah, it's sent.
Good.

269
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:35,429
Pointless--
What was that?

270
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,098
Nothing, sir. It's a brilliant plan.
I'm sure we'll all be saved.

271
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,018
I'm getting a little weary
of this attitude, Wash.

272
00:17:41,101 --> 00:17:44,730
(chuckling)
Are you? Well, I'm so very sorry, sir.

273
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,273
I guess the news that we're all gonna be

274
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:48,275
purple and bloated and fetal in a few
hours...

275
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:50,110
has made me a little snippy.

276
00:17:50,194 --> 00:17:52,571
It's possible someone might
pick up that signal.

277
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:56,909
No, Mal, it's not possible. No one's
gonna pick up the damn signal.

278
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,453
You wanted us flying under the radar,
remember? Well, that's where we are.

279
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:02,289
Out of range of anyone or anything.
Then make it go further.

280
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:05,876
I What?
Make the signal go further.

281
00:18:05,959 --> 00:18:07,544
I can't make it go further.

282
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,797
Not if all you gonna do is sit
around here and whinge about it, no.

283
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,217
What do you expect me to do?
Whatever you have to.

284
00:18:13,217 --> 00:18:16,053
And if you can't do it from here, then get
a suit on and go outside and--

285
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:19,848
And what? Wave my arms around?
Wave your arms around.

286
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:22,601
Jump up and down.
Divert the navsats to the transmitter.

287
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,687
Whatever.
Divert the--Right!

288
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:28,398
Because teenage pranks are fun
when you're about to die.

289
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,235
It'd give the beacon a boost, wouldn't it?
Yes, Mal.

290
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:34,738
It would boost the signal. But even if
some passerby did happen to receive, all

291
00:18:34,822 --> 00:18:37,699
it would do is muck up their navigation.
Could be that's true.

292
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:40,285
Damn right it's true!
They'd be forced to stop...

293
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:43,288
and dig out our signal before
they could even go anyplace.

294
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,127
Well, maybe I should do that then!
Maybe you should!

295
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,253
Okay!
Good!

296
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,880
Fine!
Hey!

297
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:54,091
What do you two
think you're doin'?

298
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:56,635
Fightin'
at a time like this.

299
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,597
You'll use up all the air.

300
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,058
(alarm blaring)
WOMAN: (over p.a.) Life support failure.

301
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,144
Check oxygen levels at once.

302
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:11,441
(message repeats in Chinese)

303
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:18,115
Life support failure.
Check oxygen levels at once.

304
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:23,203
(p.a. continues,
indistinct)

305
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,621
Bester?

306
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:28,542
What's this I hear about yet

307
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:30,294
another delay?
(moaning, grunting)

308
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,504
Supposed to have this engine
fixed and us up and--

309
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:36,133
What in the name of-- (speaking Chinese)
(grunting)

310
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,637
Bester?

311
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:43,307
(woman moaning)
Bester.

312
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:47,769
Bester!
(clattering)

313
00:19:50,772 --> 00:19:51,773
What?

314
00:19:52,816 --> 00:19:54,610
You do realize we've been
parked on this rock...

315
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:58,322
a week longer than we planned?
Yeah.

316
00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:00,532
But, uh, there's--
there's stuff to do.

317
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:04,161
As for example that job we got waiting
for us on Pacquin.

318
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:07,206
When we landed, you said you needed a few
days to get us space-worthy again,

319
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,666
and is there something
wrong with your bunk?

320
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:11,501
Why?

321
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:18,717
Oh, no, Captain.
She likes engines.

322
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,220
(whispers) They make her hot.
(chuckles)

323
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:26,350
Bester. Get your prairie harpy off my boat
and put us back in the air.

324
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:29,478
Okay, but c-can't.

325
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,689
What do you mean, "can't"?
No can do, Cap.

326
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:36,151
Secondary grav boot's shot.
KAYLEE: No it ain't.

327
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:40,572
Ain't nothin' wrong with your grav boot.
Grav boot's just fine.

328
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:42,241
Hello.

329
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,371
She doesn't-- That's not what it--
No, it ain't.

330
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,999
Sure it is! Grav boot ain't your trouble.

331
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,586
I seen the trouble plain as day when I was
down there on my back before.

332
00:20:55,337 --> 00:20:56,672
Your reg couple's bad.

333
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:00,842
The red--
The what?

334
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:05,597
The reg couple.
Right here. See?

335
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,814
No.
This.

336
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,317
I'm pointin' right at it.
(chuckles)

337
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,112
Hey!
Here.

338
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:22,281
Hand me that, will you?

339
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:25,534
Don't serve
much of a purpose anyway.

340
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,746
Just tends to gum up
the works when it gets tacked.

341
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,499
So I figure
why even have one?

342
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,918
Better to just
take your G-line,

343
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,879
plug it straight
into the port pin-lock,

344
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,924
and that should, uh--
(motor whirring)

345
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,384
There!

346
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:46,305
What'd you do?
She fixed it.

347
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:49,725
Well, it wasn't really broke.
Where'd you learn how to do that, miss?

348
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:53,854
Just do it, that's all.
My daddy says I got natural talent.

349
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,648
I'll say you do at that.
Don't we need this?

350
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:57,941
You work for your daddy do you?

351
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,652
Well, when he got work.
Which ain't too often lately.

352
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,821
You got much experience
with a vessel like this?

353
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:05,282
I never even been up
in one before.

354
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,745
Wanna?
You mean

355
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,872
Sure.
For how long?

356
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:14,583
Long as you like.
Long as you can keep her in the sky.

357
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:18,587
You offering me a job?
Wh-What?

358
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:23,467
Believe I just did.
I just gotta ask my folks.

359
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,805
Don't leave without me.

360
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:32,642
Mal! What do you need
two mechanics for?

361
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,895
I really don't.

362
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:38,815
Kaylee?
Kaylee, what're you doing?

363
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:44,529
I'm sorry, Captain.
I'm real sorry.

364
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:46,990
I should've kept
better care of her.

365
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:50,619
Usually she lets me know
when something is wrong.

366
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:54,164
Maybe she did. I just wasn't
payin' attention or--

367
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:56,333
Kaylee, I cannot be having
this from you right now.

368
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,710
We got work to do.
Dong ma?

369
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:02,381
Catalyzer's broke.
Gonna need a new one.

370
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,800
There is no new one. You gotta make do
with what you got.

371
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:10,013
It's broke.
Come on.

372
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:14,017
This the part?
It don't hardly seem like nothin'.

373
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,728
All right.
Where's it go?

374
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:23,360
Here.
But it don't fit no more.

375
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:25,695
Well, you gotta figure
a way to make it fit.

376
00:23:26,571 --> 00:23:29,866
Sometimes a thing gets broke,
can't be fixed.

377
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,535
Without this,
engine don't turn?

378
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:37,082
Engine don't turn. Life support won't
function. We don't breathe.

379
00:23:38,542 --> 00:23:40,293
You wanna keep breathin',
don't you?

380
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:43,672
So do I.

381
00:23:43,755 --> 00:23:46,383
(alarm blaring)
WOMAN: (over p.a.) Life support failure.

382
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:48,969
Check oxygen levels at once.

383
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:55,809
(message repeats in Chinese)
(shallow breaths)

384
00:23:58,228 --> 00:23:59,521
Life support failure.
(metal clanking)

385
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:02,274
Check oxygen levels at once.
(metal clanking)

386
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,528
(message repeats in Chinese)

387
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:09,156
(part clattering)

388
00:24:17,873 --> 00:24:20,584
Well, as you're
all keenly aware,

389
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:22,794
we've run into
a bit of a situation.

390
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:27,757
Engine's down, life support's
on the fritz, and I got...

391
00:24:28,258 --> 00:24:30,302
nine people here
all wantin' to breathe.

392
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:32,762
Truth is,

393
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:36,600
ain't got a whole lot
of options at this juncture.

394
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,480
So...

395
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:45,984
instead of focusing on what we don't got,
time to talk about what it is we do.

396
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:48,236
And what we got
are two shuttles--

397
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:51,114
short range,
won't go far.

398
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:54,618
But each got heat,
and they each got air.

399
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:57,704
Last longer than
what's left on Serenity.

400
00:24:57,871 --> 00:25:01,082
Long enough to reach someplace?
No.

401
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:04,169
So, where will we go then?

402
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:05,879
Far as you can get.

403
00:25:06,546 --> 00:25:08,548
We send both shuttles off
in opposite directions--

404
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:11,134
betters the chances of someone getting
seen, maybe picked up.

405
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:13,512
Shepherd Book,
Kaylee, Jayne,

406
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:16,556
you'll ride with Inara
in her shuttle.

407
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:20,227
Doc, you and your sis will ride with Wash
and Zoe, seeing as how...

408
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,521
Zoe still needs
some doctorin'.

409
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,941
What about you?

410
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,443
Four people per shuttle.
That's the arrangement.

411
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:31,238
Evens the odds.
I'm staying with Serenity.

412
00:25:31,613 --> 00:25:33,532
Captain
We sent out a beacon.

413
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:35,992
Even managed
to boost it a little.

414
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:39,996
If by some chance we get a response,
someone's gonna have to be here to answer.

415
00:25:45,001 --> 00:25:46,419
Let's get
those shuttles prepped.

416
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:52,092
Wash,
shuttles are that way.

417
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,512
I know. But like you said,
someone might answer the beacon.

418
00:25:56,221 --> 00:25:59,015
And when they do, I want to make sure that
you can call everyone back.

419
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,934
Won't take but a minute.

420
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:06,606
Jayne, you get shuttle number two ready.
I'll see to Inara's.

421
00:26:07,065 --> 00:26:10,110
Friends, get movin'.
Take only what you need.

422
00:26:14,948 --> 00:26:16,950
Mal.
If you fly smart, don't push too hard,

423
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,994
shuttle life support should last you
a good long while.

424
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:22,372
Mal, this isn't the ancient sea. You don't
have to go down with your ship!

425
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:24,374
She ain't goin' down.
She ain't goin' anywhere.

426
00:26:24,666 --> 00:26:26,293
Jayne'll be worth something
if you run into trouble,

427
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:28,962
but don't trust him
and don't let him take over.

428
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,172
You're paid up through the end of
the month. It's still your ship.

429
00:26:31,298 --> 00:26:34,217
Mal.
And as far as your security deposit goes,

430
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,344
that I might have to owe you.

431
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,348
Well, here she is.

432
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:47,230
Nice, ain't she?
Smallish.

433
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:48,815
Well, not overly.

434
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:51,943
How much room do you really need
for what you do anyway?

435
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,780
I got a surveyor and his wife
interested in renting it.

436
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:58,241
They're just waiting
to hear back.

437
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:01,328
What's her range?
Standard short.

438
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,580
She'll break atmo
from a wide orbit,

439
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:08,001
get you where you need to go,
bring you back home again.

440
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,171
She's space-worthy, just like the rest
of Serenity is.

441
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:14,549
No need to sound
so defensive, Captain.

442
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:17,719
I prefer something
with a few miles on it.

443
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:21,890
Were we to enter into this
arrangement, Captain Reynolds,

444
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,809
there are a few things I would
require from you--

445
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:27,145
the foremost being complete autonomy.

446
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:30,732
The shuttle would be my home.
No crew member, including yourself,

447
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,568
would be allowed entrance
without my express invitation.

448
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,028
You'd get your privacy.

449
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:38,907
And just so we're clear, under no
circumstances will I be servicing you...

450
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,992
or anyone who is
under your employ.

451
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:45,038
I'll post a sign.
That won't be necessary.

452
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:48,583
The other thing I would insist upon is
some measure of assurance...

453
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,168
that when I make an appointment
with a client,

454
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:53,129
I'm in a position
to keep that appointment.

455
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:56,883
So far as such assurances
are possible on a vessel of this type.

456
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:59,552
That's an awful lot of caveats and
addendums there, miss.

457
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,180
As I stated,
I just want to be clear.

458
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,557
Well, I'll be sure to take all that into
consideration

459
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:05,642
while I review the applications.

460
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:08,395
Don't be ridiculous. You're gonna rent
this shuttle to me.

461
00:28:09,646 --> 00:28:10,939
Am I?
Yes.

462
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,692
And for one quarter less
than your asking price.

463
00:28:14,734 --> 00:28:16,903
Is that a fact?
It is.

464
00:28:17,404 --> 00:28:19,989
And you figure you'll be getting
this discount...

465
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:23,118
why, exactly?
You want me.

466
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:26,454
You want me
on your ship.

467
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:29,416
Do I?
Yes.

468
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,835
Because I can bring something
that your surveyor...

469
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:35,088
or any of the other fish
you might have on-line can't--

470
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:38,049
a certain respectability.
Respecta--

471
00:28:38,133 --> 00:28:41,386
And based on what little
I've seen of your operation,

472
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:44,180
I suspect that's
something you could use.

473
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:50,603
Fine.
Let me ask you this.

474
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:55,066
If you're so respectable,
why are you even here?

475
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,445
I mean, I've heard tell of
fancy ladies such as yourself...

476
00:28:58,611 --> 00:29:01,030
shipping out with big luxury liners
and the like, but...

477
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:04,367
a registered Companion
on a boat like this?

478
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:07,579
What are you running from?
I'm not running from anything.

479
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:10,832
If it's Alliance trouble you got, you
might want to consider another ship.

480
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:13,209
Some on board here fought
for the independents.

481
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,378
The Alliance has
no quarrel with me.

482
00:29:16,004 --> 00:29:19,507
I supported unification.
Did ya?

483
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:22,969
Well, I don't suppose you're the only
whore that did.

484
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:26,264
Oh, one further addendum.

485
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,267
That's the last time
you get to call me "whore."

486
00:29:30,810 --> 00:29:33,855
Absolutely.
Never again.

487
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:37,817
Keep everything set as low as possible.
Don't waste what you got.

488
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,195
Let me do that. You never could operate
this thing.

489
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,322
(switch clicking)
(beeping, whirring)

490
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:52,415
And try not to talk.
Talking uses up air.

491
00:29:52,499 --> 00:29:54,167
Ain't no need for it.
Mal!

492
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,503
Come with us.

493
00:29:57,253 --> 00:30:01,007
Can't. Four to a shuttle, Inara. Four.

494
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:02,675
One more, you know
it can't make a difference.

495
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,303
Not now.
I'm not leaving Serenity.

496
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,348
Mal, you don't
have to die alone.

497
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,852
Everybody dies alone.

498
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,903
Everything's set and ready.
Good.

499
00:30:21,903 --> 00:30:26,407
I linked the nav systems of both shuttles
into the helm here.

500
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:28,701
When your miracle gets here,

501
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,287
you just pound this button once.
It'll call back both shuttles.

502
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,128
Go see to your wife.

503
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,392
I went ahead and closed off
all below-deck vents,

504
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:54,602
diverted what's left
to the bridge.

505
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,229
Ain't much.

506
00:30:56,563 --> 00:30:59,399
My advice is seal off everything tight
behind you on your way back up.

507
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:01,568
Might buy you some time.

508
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,488
And I prepped a suit for you.
It's hanging in the foredeck.

509
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:09,075
So when the time comes--
I won't be needing it, but thanks.

510
00:31:09,993 --> 00:31:11,244
Okay.

511
00:31:13,162 --> 00:31:14,539
Well.

512
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,426
(shuttle engines whirring)

513
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:01,479
(static hissing)

514
00:33:12,573 --> 00:33:14,283
MAN: (on radio) Firefly--
(indistinct)

515
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,869
We're just--your distress--

516
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,125
Firefly Serenity--
(garbled, indistinct)

517
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,335
(interference, static)

518
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,840
(static hissing)

519
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:52,947
I'm sorry for your troubles,
Captain. They sound many.

520
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:56,826
But you do understand, I can't
invite you aboard my vessel.

521
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:00,204
I don't know you.
I ain't askin' for a ride, Captain.

522
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,999
Just a little push is all.
Right. Your mechanical trouble.

523
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:06,044
Your compression coil, you say?
It was the catalyzer.

524
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:09,047
Not even the coil. Catalyzer's
a nothin' part, Captain.

525
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,924
It's nothin' till you don't got one. Then
it appears to be everything.

526
00:34:13,134 --> 00:34:16,637
Well, it is possible we might have
something that could do you.

527
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,474
We just come from a big salvage
mission off Ita Moon.

528
00:34:20,308 --> 00:34:22,143
I'd appreciate it.
Trouble is,

529
00:34:22,810 --> 00:34:25,521
how can I know for certain
your story's true?

530
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:29,817
Ambush could be waiting for me and my
people on the other side.

531
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,446
You can plainly see my shuttles have been
launched, just like I said.

532
00:34:34,363 --> 00:34:38,076
And by now you've scanned me. You know
I've got no life support.

533
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,042
I don't expect to see
any weapons when we board.

534
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:50,213
And I do expect to see that engine part
before I open the door.

535
00:34:51,422 --> 00:34:53,466
I feel like maybe
we can do business.

536
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,314
(air rushing)

537
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:12,443
(weapons cocking)

538
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:25,414
Check him.
Search the ship.

539
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:27,583
Start with the cockpit
and work your way down.

540
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:29,460
Is this what you meant
by "ambush"?

541
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,838
We're just
verifying your story.

542
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:35,341
You find anybody on board not supposed
to be, you shoot 'em.

543
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:38,177
I thought we were gonna
be reasonable about this.

544
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:41,556
Reason. He's gonna talk to us
about reason now.

545
00:35:41,889 --> 00:35:43,599
(snickers)
Yeah. That's a joke.

546
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:47,436
Which one you figure tracked us?
The ugly one, sir.

547
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,606
Could you be
more specific?

548
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:54,735
Do we look reasonable to you?
Well, looks can be deceiving.

549
00:35:55,278 --> 00:36:00,783
Not as deceiving as a lowdown...
dirty... deceiver.

550
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,869
(chuckling)
Well said.

551
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:06,330
Wasn't that well said, Zoe?
Had a kind of poetry to it, sir.

552
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,541
You want I should
shoot 'em now, Marco?

553
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:11,085
Wait till they tell us
where they put the stuff.

554
00:36:12,336 --> 00:36:15,631
That's a good idea.
Good idea.

555
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:18,968
Tell us where the stuff's at,
so I can shoot ya.

556
00:36:20,344 --> 00:36:21,554
Point of interest.

557
00:36:22,471 --> 00:36:26,976
Offerin' to shoot us might not work so
well as an incentive as you might imagine.

558
00:36:27,852 --> 00:36:29,353
Anyway,
we've hidden it.

559
00:36:29,437 --> 00:36:32,064
So, you kill us,
you'll never find it.

560
00:36:32,648 --> 00:36:36,986
Found you easy enough.
Yeah, you did, didn't you?

561
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:39,947
How much
they payin' you?

562
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:44,952
Huh?
I mean, let's say you did kill us,

563
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,121
or didn't, there could be torture,
whatever.

564
00:36:47,163 --> 00:36:50,249
But somehow, you found the goods.
What would your cut be?

565
00:36:51,083 --> 00:36:53,377
Seven percent,
straight off the top.

566
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:56,130
Seven. Oh.

567
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:58,883
What?
Hmm? Nothin'.

568
00:36:59,342 --> 00:37:01,469
Not a thing.
No, I just--

569
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,512
Does that seem low to you?
It does, sir.

570
00:37:03,596 --> 00:37:05,181
That ain't low.
Stop it!

571
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:07,975
Seven percent's standard.
(laughs) Okay.

572
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,728
Zoe. I'm payin' you too much.
Why? What does she get?

573
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:12,730
Knock it off!
Look, forget I said anything.

574
00:37:12,813 --> 00:37:17,777
I'm sure you're treated very well. You
get the perks, got your own room--

575
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:21,322
No?
You share a bunk?

576
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:26,744
With that one.
(chuckles) Really.

577
00:37:27,078 --> 00:37:30,248
Jayne, this ain't funny.
Yeah, I ain't laughin'.

578
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:34,794
You move on over to this side, we'll
not only show you where the stuff's at,

579
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,879
we'll see to it
you get your fair share.

580
00:37:37,296 --> 00:37:40,591
Not no sad seven.
Private room?

581
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:44,303
Jayne! Your own room, full run
of the kitchen whole shot.

582
00:37:44,303 --> 00:37:46,597
Jayne, I ain't askin'!
(groaning)

583
00:37:46,889 --> 00:37:48,057
Shut up.

584
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:52,061
(groaning continues)
How big a room?

585
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:55,189
Ship's clear, Captain.

586
00:37:56,482 --> 00:38:00,319
You check the engine room?
It's like he said, catalyzer's blown.

587
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:02,154
That's all he needs.

588
00:38:02,905 --> 00:38:05,908
You know, anything that's worth anything
is really right here in this cargo bay.

589
00:38:05,992 --> 00:38:09,745
So you take a look around,
decide what you think is fair.

590
00:38:10,204 --> 00:38:11,872
Already decided.

591
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,755
We're taking your ship.
(labored breathing)

592
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:24,093
Billy, get this plugged in.
Jesse, call Stern over here.

593
00:38:24,176 --> 00:38:27,221
You and him are gonna pilot this pile
of go-se out of here.

594
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:30,808
(pistol cocking)
We'll get it as far as--

595
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:34,687
Jesse, don't call Stern.

596
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:37,898
Billy,
leave the catalyzer.

597
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,030
Do as he says.

598
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,824
(shuddering)

599
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,909
Take your people and go.

600
00:39:06,344 --> 00:39:08,429
You would've done the same.

601
00:39:08,512 --> 00:39:10,890
We can already see
I haven't.

602
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,351
Now get the hell
off my ship.

603
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:17,646
(door mechanism
whirring)

604
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:38,250
(Klaxon blaring)
WOMAN: (on p.a., speaking Chinese)

605
00:39:40,419 --> 00:39:44,799
Life support failure.
Check oxygen levels at once.

606
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:50,262
(message repeats in Chinese)

607
00:39:53,682 --> 00:39:57,311
Life support failure.
Check oxygen levels at once.

608
00:39:58,938 --> 00:40:03,609
(message repeats in Chinese)

609
00:40:03,692 --> 00:40:05,903
(grunting, straining)
Life support failure.

610
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:08,114
(grunting, straining)
Check oxygen levels at once.

611
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,873
(rapid breathing)

612
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:26,173
(accelerating whir)

613
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,248
(wheezing)

614
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,250
(panting)

615
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,296
(clattering)

616
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,386
MAN: Real beauty, ain't she?
KAYLEE: Serenity's not moving.

617
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,346
INARA: Mal, come with us.
WASH: When your miracle gets here,

618
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,598
pound this button once--
it'll call back both shuttles.

619
00:41:15,681 --> 00:41:17,266
Everybody dies alone.

620
00:41:19,185 --> 00:41:22,563
WASH: I'll run up and scrape up a piece.
ZOE: You'd do that for me?

621
00:41:22,646 --> 00:41:28,277
I'd do anything for you. You know that.
(muttering)

622
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:31,989
MAN: Oh, you're a pretty baby.

623
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:34,366
INARA: I think it's something
he should see when he wakes up.

624
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:38,787
JAYNE: He's seen blood before, lots of it.
Welcome back, sir.

625
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,500
(groggily)
I go someplace?

626
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,293
Very nearly.

627
00:41:44,877 --> 00:41:48,964
We thought we lost you.
I've been right here.

628
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:56,055
Wash, you okay?
Yeah, Mal, I'm fine.

629
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:58,265
You got a thing in your arm.
Yeah!

630
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,727
Try not to speak. You're heavily
medicated, and you lost a lot of blood.

631
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,354
(groans)

632
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:08,859
I thought I ordered
you all off the ship?

633
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:14,406
I call you back?
No, Mal, you didn't.

634
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:16,659
I take full responsibility,
Captain.

635
00:42:17,826 --> 00:42:19,286
The decision
saved your life.

636
00:42:19,828 --> 00:42:24,750
Won't happen again, sir.
Good.

637
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,670
And thanks.
I'm grateful.

638
00:42:28,045 --> 00:42:29,755
It was my pleasure, sir.

639
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,132
Hey, you know, we'd have been back first,

640
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:34,260
except there's somethin' wrong
with Inara's shuttle.

641
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:36,762
She done somethin' to it, Mal.
It smells funny.

642
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:39,598
I told you. That's incense.
So you say.

643
00:42:40,224 --> 00:42:42,685
Hey, Captain.
Hey.

644
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,729
You fixed the ship.
Good work.

645
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,274
Thanks.
All right.

646
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:51,068
I have to insist-- the captain needs
to rest.

647
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:55,781
Yeah. I think the doc might not
be wrong about that one.

648
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,158
Just going to need a few--

649
00:43:03,539 --> 00:43:05,666
You all gonna be here
when I wake up?

650
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:10,045
We'll be here.
Good.

651
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:14,091
That's good.

652
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:22,766
Yep.
Real beauty, ain't she?

653
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:26,061
Yes sir, a right smart purchase,
this vessel.

654
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:32,901
I'll tell you what. You buy this ship,
treat her proper,

655
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,779
she'll be with you
for the rest of your life.

656
00:43:37,781 --> 00:43:42,786
Son?
Hey, son!

657
00:43:42,786 --> 00:43:46,165
(chuckles)
You hear a word I've been sayin'?

658
00:44:25,037 --> 00:44:26,705
Grr! Arrgh!
