00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:04,462
BOOK: After the Earth was used up,
we found a new solar system

2
00:00:04,546 --> 00:00:07,549
and hundreds of new Earths
were terraformed and colonized.

3
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,884
The Central Planets formed the Alliance...

4
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:13,388
and decided all the planets had to join
under their rule.

5
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:15,640
There was some disagreement
on that point.

6
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:18,977
After the war, many of the independents
who had fought and lost...

7
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:22,856
drifted to the edges of the system,
far from Alliance control.

8
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:26,735
Out here, people struggled to get by with
the most basic technologies.

9
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:30,780
A ship would bring you work.
A gun would help you keep it.

10
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:31,990
A captain's goal was simple--

11
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:36,244
Find a crew.
Find a job. Keep flying.

12
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:40,123
Come on, admit it.
It's true.

13
00:00:40,498 --> 00:00:42,208
No, I won't,
because it's not.

14
00:00:42,834 --> 00:00:47,255
I use swear words, like anybody else.
Oh, really?

15
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:50,091
See, I've never heard you. So when is
it that you do all this cussing?

16
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:52,677
After I go to bed, or--
I swear...

17
00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:54,304
when it's appropriate.

18
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:58,349
Simon, the whole point of swearing is that
it ain't appropriate.

19
00:01:00,226 --> 00:01:01,269
Hey, there, Inara.

20
00:01:01,978 --> 00:01:04,481
Heading off for some
glamorous romance?

21
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:07,317
(chuckling)
Let's hope so. See you two tomorrow.

22
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,779
Don't let Mal get you into too much
trouble while I'm gone.

23
00:01:11,154 --> 00:01:13,531
Bye now.
Have good sex.

24
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:20,538
What?
(clattering)

25
00:01:25,877 --> 00:01:26,753
Oh!

26
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,215
Now, this would be a perfect
time for a swear word.

27
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:33,009
What... happened
in here?

28
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:37,430
Needed to find some tape.
So you had to tear my infirmary apart?

29
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,015
Apparently.

30
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:42,143
My God. You're like
a trained ape.

31
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:44,646
Without the training.

32
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:45,980
Jayne.

33
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,399
I told you we're setting down on the
Canton factory settlement

34
00:01:48,483 --> 00:01:49,359
on Higgins's Moon.

35
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:51,277
Yep. That you did.

36
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:53,363
Canton don't allow
guns in their town.

37
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:56,491
Yes, sir. That's why I ain't
strappin' one to my hip.

38
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,869
No. That's why you ain't
strapping one anywhere.

39
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,455
Oh, listen, Mal, I was in Canton
a few years back.

40
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,291
I might have made me
a few enemies thereabouts.

41
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,460
Enemies? You?

42
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,587
No! How can it be?

43
00:02:10,046 --> 00:02:12,549
Just don't like the idea of goin' in there
empty-handed, is all.

44
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,176
Why are you still arguing
what's been decided?

45
00:02:30,859 --> 00:02:33,611
Okay, Inara. We're atmospheric.
You are good to go.

46
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,488
Thanks, Wash.

47
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,074
Disengaging
in three,

48
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,701
two, one.

49
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,560
Canton really stinks.

50
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,478
That's what makes it such a great drop
point.

51
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:09,230
No one comes here that doesn't have to.

52
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:11,733
I vote we do this job
really, really fast.

53
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:15,278
Kessler's our man. He's holding the goods
we're to deliver.

54
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,240
We go in, make contact--
Easy-peasy.

55
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,659
Zoe, you're holdin' down
the fort.

56
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:22,577
Call ahead to Bernoulli,

57
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,537
let him know he'll have his merchandise
end of the week.

58
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:27,790
Don't I usually stay with the ship?
I outrank you.

59
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:29,292
Have fun.

60
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,004
So, this is a place
where they--

61
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,590
they make mud.

62
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:40,428
Yep. Clay, really. You'd be surprised how
many things it ends up in.

63
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:43,181
Serenity's got more than a few ceramic
parts in her.

64
00:03:43,473 --> 00:03:44,599
Really?
Yeah.

65
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,851
Huh.
Captain, don't you think

66
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,686
Simon should come with us?

67
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:52,023
What? K-Kaylee, I don't think
it's a good--

68
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,192
BOOK: Go on, boy.
See the sights.

69
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:57,362
I can watch over your sister.
I believe...

70
00:03:57,946 --> 00:03:59,530
we've been developing a rapport.

71
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:03,159
I-I don't know. River--
Go on.

72
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:06,829
I'm a shepherd after all. I should be able
to keep my eye on a flock of one.

73
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:13,169
We're not going that far, Doctor, and you
might maybe make yourself useful.

74
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:15,421
Come again?

75
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:19,259
The management here don't take too kindly
to sightseers, which is why we're...

76
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,344
posin' as buyers.

77
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:24,180
There ain't a one of us looks the part
more than the good doctor.

78
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,557
I mean, the pretty fits,

79
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,686
soft hands--definitely
a moneyed individual.

80
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:33,314
All rich and lily-white, pasty all over--
All right!

81
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:36,776
Fine. I'll go.
Just stop describing me.

82
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,945
You're the boss,
boss.

83
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:42,865
He's the boss now? Day keeps gettin'
better and better.

84
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,212
Area's employees only.

85
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,549
Best be getting back to the landing unless
you have business here.

86
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:01,843
Yes.

87
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:07,015
Yes, I--I'm looking...
to buy some mud.

88
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:11,019
Well, then. (chuckles)
You've come to the right place.

89
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,735
Course, we can handle
any volume here.

90
00:05:19,027 --> 00:05:22,280
We've over 2,000 workers,
mostly indentured.

91
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,198
We pay them next to nothing.

92
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:28,494
That way we can pass the savings directly
on to you, the customer.

93
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,787
SIMON:
Savings.

94
00:05:30,538 --> 00:05:32,915
Uh, excellent.
That's, uh--

95
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:37,253
Because as I said before, I'm gonna--I'm
gonna be needing quite a bit of it.

96
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,589
I, uh--
I'm a buyer.

97
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,966
The best of its kind.

98
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,219
Uh, we mix it, we brick it raw
right here on the premises.

99
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:48,389
Uh, you add the right catalyst,
you kiln it proper,

100
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:52,310
this stuff's 10 times stronger than steel
at half the weight.

101
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,689
Yes.
I've heard great, uh--

102
00:05:56,773 --> 00:06:00,443
What happened to Simon?
Who is this diabolical master of disguise?

103
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:02,153
He's learning.

104
00:06:02,278 --> 00:06:03,738
It's, uh--
MAL: Excuse me, boss.

105
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,616
I'm sure the foreman has
things need attending.

106
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,743
Why don't we wander a bit,
take a look at the operation?

107
00:06:08,826 --> 00:06:10,953
Then you can figure on whether
we get an account here.

108
00:06:11,287 --> 00:06:12,205
Yes?

109
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:16,459
Yes. Yes, we'll uh--

110
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,253
We'll-We'll wander a bit.

111
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,757
Fair enough. Come and see me
when you're through.

112
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:30,056
All right. Let's head toward the town,
find our man Kessler, get this job done.

113
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,811
Boy's gonna get us killed.
Let's just do this deal and get.

114
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:37,814
His disguise isn't
half as funny as yours.

115
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,150
Who are you supposed to be, anyway?
You haven't been here in years Jayne.

116
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,069
You really think
you need that getup?

117
00:06:43,444 --> 00:06:45,571
No one's gonna
remember you.

118
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,323
I think it's possible
they might.

119
00:07:01,796 --> 00:07:03,840

Jayne?
Yeah?

132
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,736
You wanna tell me
how come there's a statue...

133
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,071
of you here lookin' at me
like I owe him somethin'?

134
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:14,160
Wishin' I could, Captain.
No, seriously, Jayne. You wanna tell me

135
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:16,078
Look, Mal,
I got no ruttin' idea.

136
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:20,875
I was here a few years back,
like I said,

137
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,002
pulled a second story, stole a lot of
scratch

138
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:24,712
from the magistrate up on the hill,

139
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,381
but things went...
way south.

140
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:29,300
I had to hightail it.
They don't...

141
00:08:29,717 --> 00:08:32,553
put you on a pedestal
in the town square for that.

142
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:36,599
Yeah, 'cept I'm looking at some very
compelling evidence says they do.

143
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,602
This must be
what going mad feels like.

144
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,812
I think they
captured him, though.

145
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:45,191
You know,
captured his essence.

146
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,193
Looks sorta angry,
don't he?

147
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:48,694
That's kinda what I meant.

148
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,697
(whistle blowing)

149
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:55,284
FOREMAN: Shift four on duty.
Shift four on duty.

150
00:08:57,453 --> 00:08:59,622
Uh, hey.
I got an idea.

151
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:03,960
Instead of us hangin' around playin' art
critic till I get pinched by the man,

152
00:09:04,043 --> 00:09:06,295
how's about we move away
from this eerie-ass piece of work...

153
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,339
and get along with our increasingly
eerie-assed day, how's that?

154
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,715
I don't know.

155
00:09:10,466 --> 00:09:13,386
This here's a spectacle might warrant
a moment's consideration.

156
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,891
Everywhere I go,
his eyes keep following me.

157
00:09:20,268 --> 00:09:21,978
Come on, gorram it.
We got a job.

158
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,480
Let's go do it,
get the hell outta here.

159
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:31,362
I crossed the magistrate of this company
town. Understand?

160
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,658
He ain't exactly
a forgivin' sort of guy.

161
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:40,830
Magistrate Higgins, I may presume.
You may.

162
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:44,959
But I only make the people I own
use my title.

163
00:09:45,543 --> 00:09:48,129
Mr. Higgins... (kisses hand)
will do fine.

164
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:50,715
And you can call me
Inara, Mr. Higgins.

165
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:55,553
It's a rare pleasure,
your visit to my little moon.

166
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,306
Journey wasn't too taxing?
Not at all.

167
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:02,810
I'm refreshed and ready.
Shall we begin at, say, 7:30?

168
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:03,853
Perfect.

169
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:09,150
I have a feeling it will take all your art
to deal with this particular problem.

170
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:13,070
Every problem, Mr. Higgins,
is an opportunity in disguise.

171
00:10:21,787 --> 00:10:26,042
What are we up to, sweetheart?
Fixing your Bible.

172
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,712
I, um--What?

173
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,423
Your Bible's broken.

174
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:36,010
Contradictions, false logistics--
Doesn't make sense.

175
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,679
No, no.
Y-You can't--

176
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,514
So we'll integrate non-progressional
evolution

177
00:10:40,598 --> 00:10:42,475
theory with God's creation of Eden.

178
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:46,270
Eleven inherent metaphoric
parallels already there.

179
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,273
Eleven.

180
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,276
Important number. Prime number. One goes
into the house of 11, 11 times...

181
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,612
but always comes out one.

182
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,783
Noah's ark is a problem.
Really?

183
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,702
We'll have to call it "early quantum state
phenomenon."

184
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:06,040
Only way to fit 5,000 species of mammal
on the same boat.

185
00:11:06,248 --> 00:11:07,583
Give me that.

186
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:12,213
River, you don't...
fix the Bible.

187
00:11:13,214 --> 00:11:14,882
It's broken.

188
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:17,051
It doesn't make sense.

189
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:22,306
It's not about...
making sense.

190
00:11:22,973 --> 00:11:24,892
It's about believing
in something.

191
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:30,022
And letting that belief be real enough
to change your life.

192
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:31,774
It's about faith.

193
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,403
You don't fix faith, River.

194
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:39,073
It fixes you.

195
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,039
(paper tears)

196
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,126
You hang on
to those, then.

197
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,586
(people chattering)

198
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,424
(strumming guitar chord)

199
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,262
JAYNE: Can't be a statue of me.
No reason for it.

200
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,806
Flies in the face
of every kind of sense.

201
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,852
Won't argue with that.

202
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,229
(spitting)

203
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,899
(speaking Chinese)

204
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:17,111
Mmm. They call it mudder's milk.
(gags)

205
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:22,491
All the protein, vitamins and carbs of
your grandma's best turkey dinner,

206
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,952
plus 15 percent alcohol.

207
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:27,872
It's horrific.
SIMON: Worked for the Egyptians.

208
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:30,666
What's that?
The ancient Egyptians.

209
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:32,501
Back on Earth-that-was.

210
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:34,712
Not so different from the ancestral form
of beer

211
00:12:34,837 --> 00:12:36,922
they fed the slaves to build pyramids.

212
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:41,177
It's liquid bread.
It kept them from starving...

213
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,804
and knocked them out at night, so they
wouldn't be inclined to insurrection.

214
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:48,684
Wow. Simon, that was
so... historical.

215
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,481
Now, what's a gussied-up fella like
you doing in a place like this?

216
00:13:00,029 --> 00:13:02,198
Shake your head, boy.
Your eyes are stuck.

217
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:04,950
Git!
(gasps)

218
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:12,500
You wouldn't be looking for Kessler?
Just havin' a brew.

219
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,587
I knew a Kessler.
Knew?

220
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:21,175
He was a good
middleman.

221
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:23,302
Low-profile.
Didn't filch.

222
00:13:23,886 --> 00:13:26,305
Last week, the factory foreman
and his prod crew...

223
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:28,349
heard he was movin'
contraband through town.

224
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:31,519
Gave him a peck of trouble for it.
What kind of peck was that?

225
00:13:31,769 --> 00:13:34,313
The kind where they hacked off
his hands and feet with a machete,

226
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,942
rolled him into the bog.
They peck pretty hard around here.

227
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:41,403
Listen. My client off-world
is waiting for his delivery.

228
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,322
If the goods are gone--
Not to worry.

229
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:46,951
Your man's merchandise
is here, safe in Kessler's hiding place.

230
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,620
We just gotta figure out
how to get it across town...

231
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,498
without being seen by the foreman
and his prods.

232
00:13:52,790 --> 00:13:55,376
I advise we all just
lay low for a moment.

233
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,966

I stole that money from Higgins
like the song says.

260
00:15:44,652 --> 00:15:48,072
Lifted me one of his hovercraft,
but I got tagged by anti-aircraft,

261
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,991
started losin' altitude, had to dump them
strongboxes...

262
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:53,118
stay airborne.

263
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:00,167
Sixty thousand,

untraceable,

265
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:06,799
and I drop it right square
in the middle of mud farmer central.

266
00:16:09,593 --> 00:16:12,096

Hello?
In here, River.

270
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:34,660
Um--

271
00:16:35,452 --> 00:16:38,872
I'm--I tore these
out of your symbol,

272
00:16:38,872 --> 00:16:41,500
and they turned into paper,

273
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,211
but I want to
put them back, so--

274
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,589
Sorry. What's that?
(screaming)

275
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,427

Preacher, what the hell
did you--Whoa.

278
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,226
Captain, now they're
off the subject of me,

279
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,644
shouldn't we be gettin'
the hell out of here?

280
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:03,230
I'd say that's a reasonable request,
given the circumstances.

281
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,232
Ruttin' mudders.

282
00:17:10,988 --> 00:17:12,906
(people chattering)
MAN: There he is.

283
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,367
(all cheering)

284
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:23,208
Jayne! Jayne! Jayne!
Jayne! Jayne! Jayne!

285
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,254
(chanting continues)

286
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,350
Give me some milk.

287
00:17:43,979 --> 00:17:47,316
Don't you understand?
He's come back!

288
00:17:48,025 --> 00:17:50,486
It's Jayne!

289
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:51,987
What the--

290
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,865
Hero of Canton won't be drinkin'
that (Chinese).

291
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,451
He drinks the best whiskey
in the house!

292
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:59,203
(all cheering)

293
00:18:06,627 --> 00:18:09,254
What the hell's goin' on? Is this how
people lay low where you're from?

294
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,340
Not generally, no.
Listen, friend.

295
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:14,510
I came here to make sure
a deal went down solid.

296
00:18:14,593 --> 00:18:17,679
Not to get chopped up by the Canton prod
crew and fed to the bog.

297
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:20,432
I understand
your concerns, friend.

298
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:22,684
This here's all part
of our new plan.

299
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:25,896
(cheering continues)

300
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:32,027
Captain, how exactly is this part of--
Still working the details.

301
00:18:44,206 --> 00:18:46,083
(door opens)

302
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:54,049
Inara, allow me to introduce
my son, Fess Higgins.

303
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:58,595
Hello, Fess. Mr. Higgins,
this shuttle is a place of union.

304
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,181
I'm sure you can appreciate--
What is this?

305
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:06,145
I brought you here to bed my son,
not throw him a tea party.

306
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:10,607
Sir, a Companion greeting ceremony is a
ritual with centuries of--

307
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,902
My son is 26 years old,
and he ain't yet a man.

308
00:19:15,195 --> 00:19:18,407
Twenty-six. And since he
can't find a willing woman--

309
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,993
Mr. Higgins, you're not allowed here.

310
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:22,911
What?

311
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,873
As I said, this room is
a consecrated place of union.

312
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:29,126
Only your son belongs here.
Well, I'm--

313
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,545
Now, why don't you go on
and let us begin our work?

314
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:34,631
Now listen here, young lady--
Good night, Mr. Higgins.

315
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:43,307
Well, that's a bit
more peaceful.

316
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:45,684
Will you sit?

317
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:48,520
To Jayne!
ALL: To Jayne!

318
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,356
To me!
Woo-woo-woo-woo!

319
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,780
To the mudders!
(all cheering)

320
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,617
(yelling in Chinese)

321
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:07,206
(drunkenly)
You know, I've saved lives.

322
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,250
Dozens.
Maybe hundreds.

323
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:12,628
I--I reattached
a girl's leg.

324
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,757
Her whole leg. She named her hamster
after me.

325
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,343
I got a hamster.

326
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,346
He drops a box of money--

327
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:24,598
he gets a town.

328
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,309
(drunkenly)
Hamsters is nice.

329
00:20:27,768 --> 00:20:30,812
To Jayne. The...

330
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:34,816
box-dropping,
man-ape-gone-wrong thing.

331
00:20:36,109 --> 00:20:38,654
You know,
you are pretty funny.

332
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:42,157
And you're pretty...

333
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:44,243
pretty.

334
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,832
What did you just say?
I just said that you're pretty.

335
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:57,005
Even when you're covered
in engine grease, you're--

336
00:20:57,089 --> 00:21:01,176
No, especially, especially when you're
covered in engine grease.

337
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:04,179
It's time to get out of this nuthouse. I
got some plannin' to work out.

338
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:09,393
Now, Captain? Things are goin' so well.
I suppose.

339
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:11,812
Jayne's certainly feeling
better about life, but--

340
00:21:11,812 --> 00:21:15,565
I said, things
are going well.

341
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,945
Oh. Well.

342
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,948
Well, I tell you what.

343
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,909
Jayne is stuck here
with his adoring masses.

344
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:30,038
Why don't you and Simon hang around and
keep an eye on him for me?

345
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,046
RIVER: They say the snow on the roof
is too heavy.

346
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,591
They say the ceiling will cave in. His
brains are in terrible danger.

347
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,552
River?

348
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,930
Please, why don't you come on out?
No!

349
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,599
I can't.
Too much hair.

350
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:52,978
Is--Is that it?

351
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,813
Hell, yes, Preacher.

352
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,941
If I didn't have stuff to get done,
I'd be in there with her.

353
00:22:02,362 --> 00:22:04,281
It's the rules of my order.

354
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,701
Like the book, it symbolizes--

355
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:12,164
Uh-huh. River, honey, he's putting the
hair away now.

356
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:14,750
Doesn't matter.
It'll still be there.

357
00:22:15,167 --> 00:22:16,585
Waiting.

358
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,379
Honey, we're home!

359
00:22:20,255 --> 00:22:22,966
Where've you guys been?
Mal, Bernoulli's chomping at the bit.

360
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:24,843
Says he wants
his merchandise yesterday.

361
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,346
We got a few wrinkles
to work out on a deal.

362
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:31,600
Did you know that Jayne is
a bona fide folk hero?

363
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,311
Got a song and everything.
(speaking Chinese)

364
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,563
You've been drinking, husband.
That he has.

365
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:38,273
Don't make it any
less the case.

366
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,067
Are you telling me that Jayne--
It's true.

367
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,736
True enough we can
use it anyways.

368
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:45,864
We talked a few pillars of the mudder
community into having a little...

369
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:49,493
Jayne Day celebration
in town square tomorrow.

370
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,703
(snickering)

371
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:55,374
It should buy us enough of a distraction
to get the stolen goods out...

372
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:57,209
from under the foreman
and his crew of prods.

373
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,879
You're really gonna have to
start again. Jayne's a what?

374
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:04,257
This whole thing--
Uh, it--

375
00:23:04,591 --> 00:23:06,134
It is embarrassing.

376
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:12,224
My father's right again, I guess. And to
have to bring you here--

377
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:16,645
Your father isn't right, Fess. It's not
embarrassing to be a virgin.

378
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,356
It's simply one's
state of being.

379
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:22,317
As far as
bringing me here--

380
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:26,696
Companions choose the people
they're to be with very carefully.

381
00:23:28,115 --> 00:23:29,616
For example,

382
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,743
if your father had asked me to come here
for him,

383
00:23:32,035 --> 00:23:33,245
I wouldn't have.

384
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:35,914
Really?

385
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:37,833
Really, Fess.

386
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,086
But you're different
from him.

387
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:45,424
The more you accept that,
the stronger you'll become.

388
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,228
So the magistrate, he let you folks
keep all that cash?

389
00:23:58,311 --> 00:24:00,730
He did. And it pained him,
that's for dead sure.

390
00:24:01,022 --> 00:24:04,151
When he found out, he sent his prods in
to take it back from us,

391
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:07,821
but the workers resisted.
Fought the law, huh?

392
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:11,241
If the mudders are together on a thing,
there's too many of us to be put down.

393
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:14,077
So in the end,
he just called it a bonus.

394
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:15,954
That's one hell of a bonus.

395
00:24:16,037 --> 00:24:18,665
And then, when we put that
statue of you in town square,

396
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:20,792
he rolled in,
wanted to tear it down,

397
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,794
but the whole town
rioted.

398
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:29,217
You guys had a riot?
On account of me?

399
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,762
My very own riot?

400
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,890
I can't believe
you're back.

401
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:40,353
How could I stay away?
Hey.

402
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,650
Magistrate Higgins.

403
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,527
My son's out there.

404
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:50,697
I pray to God
losin' his cherry.

405
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:53,909
There's a problem
in Worker Town, sir.

406
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:57,537
Jayne Cobb's
come back.

407
00:25:10,258 --> 00:25:12,636
(knocking)
(man groaning)

408
00:25:19,809 --> 00:25:21,102
Evening, Stitch.

409
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:22,604
What do you want with me?

410
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,357
Nothin'. You've done your
time. You've paid your debt.

411
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,567
It's time you were
on your way.

412
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:40,205
(grunting)

413
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:45,710
Here. I believe these
were your personal effects.

414
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:56,846
(grunting)
You keep me in that box four years,

415
00:25:56,930 --> 00:25:58,306
and you give me
a loaded gun?

416
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,475
You got the urge
to use it, no doubt.

417
00:26:01,017 --> 00:26:03,270
But I'm not the one that brought you in
on that robbery.

418
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,021
I'm not the one who partnered up with you,

419
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,649
then turned on you
when his plan went south.

420
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:11,319
How high up was that shuttle when he
pushed you out? Thirty feet?

421
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:15,865
Jayne Cobb cost you
four years of your life,

422
00:26:16,241 --> 00:26:18,326
plus a perfectly good
eyeball.

423
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,538
And here's the poetical portion--
He's back in town.

424
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:23,873
This very day.

425
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:28,295
Best of luck
in your new life.

426
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:55,405
Hey, Captain... Captain!

427
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:58,783
Hey... Mal.

428
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:00,952
Mal, I, uh--uh--

429
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:04,039
No, n-nothing happened.

430
00:27:04,831 --> 00:27:07,292
No, there was, uh-- There was--
There was some drinking,

431
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,919
but, uh, we
certainly didn't--

432
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,256
I would never--
Not with Kaylee.

433
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,884
What do you mean, not with me?
Yeah. Uh-huh.

434
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,594
Where's my hero?

435
00:27:17,677 --> 00:27:21,431
♪ My love for me now
Ain't hard to explain ♪

436
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:27,270
♪ The hero of Canton
The man they call me ♪

437
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:30,899
Eggs. The living legend
needs eggs.

438
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,734
Or maybe another milk.

439
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:36,071
No. The livin' legend needs to come with
us. He's got a little appearance to make.

440
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:38,865
He does?
That's right.

441
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,701
This job here's gone
way past long enough.

442
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:45,205
Well, you go on now. I got me important
hero-type stuff to do.

443
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:57,050
Where are you goin'?
I'm goin' with you.

444
00:27:57,050 --> 00:28:01,429
Mmm, I don't think so.
No, maybe you ought to stay here.

445
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,474
It's about the time for a civilized person
to have his breakfast.

446
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:07,560
That's the sort of thing would be
appropriate, don't you think?

447
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:22,450
(sighs)

448
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:26,162
Excuse me. Could I, uh--
Could I see a menu?

449
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:28,164
MAN:
A what?

450
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,668
You're very quiet.

451
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:33,837
I'm sorry.

452
00:28:35,714 --> 00:28:37,257
I just--

453
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:40,593
I just thought I'd feel...

454
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:44,013
different... after.

455
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:49,978
Aren't I supposed to be
a man now?

456
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:55,775
A man is just a boy who's old enough
to ask that question.

457
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:03,158
Our time together,
it's a ritual,

458
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:04,534
a symbol.

459
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,953
It means something
to your father.

460
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,333
I hope it was not entirely forgettable
for you.

461
00:29:12,834 --> 00:29:16,171
Oh, no. It was--
But it doesn't make you a man.

462
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:18,840
You do that yourself.

463
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,972
(knocking)
HIGGINS: Fess! Fess Higgins!

464
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,974
Get out here!

465
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:33,480
So, that's where the little Jayne
celebration we got planned comes in.

466
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:36,775
Should give us enough time
to get the goods back on Serenity.

467
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:38,318
I don't know.

468
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:43,323
You think we should be using my fame
to hoodwink folks?

469
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,325
You better laugh when you say that.
No, really, Mal.

470
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:48,953
I mean, maybe there's something
to this.

471
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,497
The mudders--

472
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:54,042
I think I really made
a difference in their lives.

473
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,544
You know--
me, Jayne Cobb.

474
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,672
I know your name, jackass.
You know they threw a riot on my account?

475
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,258
MAL: A riot?

476
00:30:02,467 --> 00:30:06,012
Morning, kids.
Is that Jayne? Is that really him?

477
00:30:06,262 --> 00:30:08,389
Wash, pinch me.
I must be dreaming.

478
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,975
Aw, hell, I'll pinch ya.

479
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:13,770
Just get on over
to town square, Jayne.

480
00:30:14,229 --> 00:30:16,272
Your fans are waitin'.

481
00:30:31,454 --> 00:30:34,707
ZOE: Do you really think we can get this
stuff across town without being noticed?

482
00:30:34,874 --> 00:30:36,876
MAL: Got to find it first.

483
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,095
Here we go.

484
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:52,809
Let's get it
dug up.

485
00:30:56,145 --> 00:31:00,191
A criminal hearing?
Yeah, my father's ordered me to attend.

486
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,026
You see, there's this man--

487
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,905
Well, it happened when
I was growing up here.

488
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,951
He stole a ton of money from my dad and
gave it to the poor,

489
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,661
to my father's workers.

490
00:31:12,328 --> 00:31:15,748
He's become kind of a folk hero in Canton.
Go on.

491
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,960
Well, he's back. Apparently, he landed
here yesterday.

492
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:20,712
Yesterday?

493
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:23,673
Oh, no.

494
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:28,136
I-I know this man.
He's--

495
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:32,015
He just has this idiotic sense of
nobility, you know?

496
00:31:32,932 --> 00:31:34,767
He can never just
let things go.

497
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:37,353
He thinks he's this
hard-hearted criminal,

498
00:31:37,604 --> 00:31:39,522
and he can be unrelenting,

499
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:43,484
but there's a side
to him that's just so--

500
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,695
You mean,
you actually know Jayne?

501
00:31:47,697 --> 00:31:50,658
Jayne? Jayne Cobb? You're talking about
Jayne Cobb?

502
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,660
Yes. Jayne Cobb,
the hero of Canton.

503
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:54,871
The only person I ever saw
who stood up to my father.

504
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,497
(stammering)

505
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,124
My dad had him traced back
to his ship.

506
00:31:58,207 --> 00:32:00,627
He had port control put a land-lock on it.

507
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:03,087
Jayne'll get back
and find out that he's grounded.

508
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,007
I sort of hate the idea
of his getting caught.

509
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,761
Yes, that would be bad.

510
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:16,643
(clears throat)
Uh, could I just get the...

511
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:20,355
check, please?

512
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:25,276
Heard tell you run
with Jayne Cobb.

513
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:28,696
Excuse me?

514
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:33,159
You're gonna take me to that dirty,
lowdown shingle of a man.

515
00:32:34,369 --> 00:32:37,914
Listen, sir,
I don't know who--

516
00:32:43,336 --> 00:32:47,215
"Sir"? Look at me,
you pantywaist idjit.

517
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:54,055
I just spent the last four years steamin'
in a hot box,

518
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,890
and you're "sirrin'" me?

519
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:03,606
Folks say you're
part of Jayne's team, so--

520
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:13,074
Where is that
no-good reptile hidin' hisself?

521
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:16,202
Tell me, boy, or I'll cut off every last
bit of them good looks.

522
00:33:20,415 --> 00:33:22,792
Oh, not done yet,
young'un.

523
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,004
That's gonna
cost you an eye.

524
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,965
(people chanting)
Jayne! Jayne! Jayne! Jayne! Jayne! Jayne!

525
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:31,759
Come on. Come on!

526
00:33:31,759 --> 00:33:34,178
(chanting continues)

527
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:36,180
(chanting continues)

528
00:33:41,269 --> 00:33:45,148
WASH: They love their boy.
MAL:Just drive by nice and slow.

529
00:33:50,695 --> 00:33:54,157
Come on, sir. Let's just get--
The magistrate says no.

530
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:57,410
We hold position.
Understand me?

531
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,709
Zoe, pack down
the cargo.

532
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,086
Wash, you heat up
Serenity.

533
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:08,629
We're blowin' this mess
inside half an hour.

534
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,298
Already there.

535
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:12,759
Let's go get
our wayward babes.

536
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,096
Jayne! Jayne! Jayne! Jayne! Jayne!
Jayne! Jayne! Jayne! Jayne!

537
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:20,224
Speech! Speech! Speech!

538
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:24,937
Um--
(people shouting)

539
00:34:25,313 --> 00:34:29,317
I'm no good with words.
Don't--Don't use 'em much myself.

540
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:31,694
(people chuckling)

541
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:35,448
But I want to thank you all for bein'
here and, uh, thinkin' so much of me.

542
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:37,867
Uh--

543
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,329
Far as I see it,

544
00:34:42,789 --> 00:34:44,707
you people been given the shortest end
of the stick...

545
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:48,586
ever been offered a human soul
in this crap-heel 'verse.

546
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:52,173
But you took that end,

547
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:57,095
and you--
well, you took it.

548
00:34:58,387 --> 00:34:59,847
(all murmuring agreement)
And that's--

549
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:02,266
Well, I guess
that's somethin'.

550
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,977
(cheering)

551
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,481
Wow.

552
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,775
That didn't sound
half bad.

553
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,985
I'm shocked
my own self.

554
00:35:17,615 --> 00:35:20,076
(people screaming)

555
00:35:23,704 --> 00:35:27,792
Stitch Hessian.
(chuckling)

556
00:35:28,167 --> 00:35:30,628
Well, hey, there,
Jayne.

557
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:34,006
Thought I'd make you watch while I
butcher me one of your boys.

558
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,762
He ain't a-one of mine.

559
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,140
Where you been hidin'?

560
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:45,434
You gone got yourself
lookin' mighty hideous.

561
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:46,811
(chuckles)
Oh-ho.

562
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:48,813
Yeah.

563
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:52,024
Now Jayne gets his.

564
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:57,029
Honey.
Kaylee?

565
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:01,993
So what's this about a hero of Canton?
Was I hearin' that right?

566
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:05,955
Four years of lock-down
plays tricks on the ear.

567
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,749
I ain't a hero,
Stitch.

568
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:12,587
Just a workin' stiff
like you.

569
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,840
Oh-ho.
(chuckling)

570
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,926
Yep, he's right.
Jayne is.

571
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:21,470
Fact, we used to work together,
he and I.

572
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:25,183
(trigger cocks)
(people gasping)

573
00:36:25,725 --> 00:36:28,769
Now, why don't you just let
old Stitch speak his piece?

574
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:32,940
Go on, then.

575
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:40,656
Whole lot of money in a magistrate's safe,
weren't there, Jayne?

576
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:43,534
Got away clean too.

577
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,954
But then our plane
took a hit, and we're goin' down.

578
00:36:47,455 --> 00:36:50,124
We dumped the fuel reserve, dumped the
life support.

579
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,168
Hell, we even dumped the seats.

580
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:56,339
And there's Jayne,
the money and me.

581
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:00,343
And there was no way he was gonna drop
that money.

582
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,678
He did. He dropped it
on the mudders.

583
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,474
By accident, you inbred dung head.
He tossed me out first.

584
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:11,229
For six months we run together.
He turned me out before I could scream.

585
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,900
You'd have done the same.
No. Never.

586
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:19,487
You protect the man you're with.
You watch his back.

587
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,156
Everybody knows that.

588
00:37:23,032 --> 00:37:25,743
Well, except
the hero of Canton.

589
00:37:25,826 --> 00:37:28,663
You gonna talk me to death, buddy?
Is that the plan?

590
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,206
Mm, this is the plan.

591
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:33,709
Yaah!

592
00:38:08,744 --> 00:38:10,079
Get up.

593
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:13,624
Get up, you stupid
piece of--

594
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:18,129
What'd you do that for? What's wrong
with you? Didn't you hear a word he said?

595
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,344
All of you!

596
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:29,932
You think there's someone
just gonna drop money on ya?

597
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:33,185
Money they could use?

598
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,774
Well, there ain't
people like that.

599
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,237
There's just people like me.

600
00:39:45,341 --> 00:39:48,594
Wash, we're on. Get us the hell off
of this mud ball.

601
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:51,430
WASH: Uh, yeah.
I'm, uh, workin' on it.

602
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:55,434
(buzzer buzzing)

603
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:58,354
(speaking Chinese)

604
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,567
Hello, Wash.

605
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:06,529
Has there been a problem with takeoff?
Is there a problem?

606
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,323
Is there a problem?

607
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,366
(bell dings)

608
00:40:11,575 --> 00:40:14,161
(engine powering up)

609
00:40:14,537 --> 00:40:17,415
No. We're fine.

610
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:22,837
You did what?

611
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:25,297
I sent an override
to port control,

612
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,383
lifted the land-lock
on Serenity.

613
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:31,762
I oughta wipe that smile off your head.
How dare you defy me, you--

614
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:34,765
You wanted to make a man
out of me, Dad.

615
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:37,101
I guess it worked.

616
00:41:06,797 --> 00:41:08,924
Just keep walkin',
preacher man.

617
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:14,555
KAYLEE:
You gotta be steely.

618
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:17,766
You can't be lettin' men
stomp on you so much.

619
00:41:18,517 --> 00:41:20,644
It wasn't exactly
a plan.

620
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:24,982
You ain't weak.

621
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,902
You couldn't
beat him back?

622
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:31,155
Or would that
not be appropriate?

623
00:41:32,573 --> 00:41:34,992
You're never letting go
of that, are you?

624
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:37,369
Well, you confound me some,
is all.

625
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:43,292
I mean, you like me well enough,
and we get along, and--

626
00:41:44,043 --> 00:41:46,045
And then you go all stiff.

627
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:50,466
I--I'm not, um--
I didn't--

628
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:52,676
See? You're doin' it
right now.

629
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:56,263
What's so damn important
about bein' proper?

630
00:41:58,265 --> 00:42:00,434
It don't mean nothin'
out here in the black.

631
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:03,312
It means more out here.

632
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:06,440
It's all I have.

633
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:12,446
I mean, my way
of being... polite...

634
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:14,406
or however it's--

635
00:42:14,865 --> 00:42:18,744
Well, it's the only way
I have of showing you that I like you.

636
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:23,415
I'm showing respect.

637
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,670
So, when we made love
last night--

638
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:28,796
When we what?

639
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,174
You really are
such an easy mark.

640
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:44,019
Don't make no sense.

641
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:49,441
What--

642
00:42:50,985 --> 00:42:53,487
Why the hell'd that mudder have to go
and do that for, Mal--

643
00:42:53,862 --> 00:42:55,906
jumpin' in front
of the shotgun blast?

644
00:42:59,702 --> 00:43:02,746
Hell, there weren't a one of 'em
understood what happened out there.

645
00:43:03,372 --> 00:43:06,417
They're probably sticking
that statue right back up.

646
00:43:06,875 --> 00:43:07,876
Most like.

647
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,047
I don't know why
that eats at me so.

648
00:43:12,506 --> 00:43:14,383
It's my estimation that...

649
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,970
every man ever got a statue made of him

650
00:43:18,345 --> 00:43:20,180
was one kind of a son of a bitch or
another.

651
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:25,144
Ain't about you, Jayne.

652
00:43:27,187 --> 00:43:28,772
It's about what they need.

653
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:38,115
Don't make no sense.

654
00:44:25,579 --> 00:44:27,414
Grr! Arrgh!
