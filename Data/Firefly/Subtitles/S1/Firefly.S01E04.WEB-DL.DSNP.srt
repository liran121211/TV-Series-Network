1
00:00:01,084 --> 00:00:02,419
MAN: Here's how it is.

2
00:00:02,502 --> 00:00:06,715
Earth got used up, so we terraformed
a whole new galaxy of Earths--

3
00:00:06,715 --> 00:00:08,717
some rich and plush
with the new technologies,

4
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,677
some not so much.

5
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:12,595
Central planets,
them as formed the Alliance,

6
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:15,432
waged war to bring
everyone under their rule.

7
00:00:15,432 --> 00:00:18,560
A few idiots tried to fight it,
among them myself.

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,812
I'm Malcolm Reynolds,
captain of Serenity.

9
00:00:20,812 --> 00:00:24,691
Got a good crew--
fighters, pilot, mechanic.

10
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:27,652
We even picked up a preacher
and a bona fide companion.

11
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,864
There's a doctor, too, took his genius
sister out of some Alliance camp,

12
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,532
so they're keeping
a low profile.

13
00:00:32,741 --> 00:00:34,284
You got a job,
we can do it--

14
00:00:35,243 --> 00:00:37,037
don't much care what it is.

15
00:00:47,505 --> 00:00:50,300
Didn't hardly have to convert
the ship, even.

16
00:00:50,383 --> 00:00:52,594
Six in the corner.

17
00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:56,264
Stronger locks, thicker doors. Keep
everybody where they're supposed to be.

18
00:00:56,473 --> 00:00:58,266
Don't even need
more rations.

19
00:00:58,767 --> 00:01:00,060
MAN: Hey!
(men groaning)

20
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,729
Wait.
Come on!

21
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:07,484
(moans)

22
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,363
(groaning)

23
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:16,242
You made money, huh?
Hand over fist, my friend.

24
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:20,497
Water planets need labor. Terra-forming
crews got a prodigious death rate.

25
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:23,124
Labor?
You mean, uh, slaves.

26
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:27,670
Well, they wasn't volunteers,
for damn sure.

27
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:31,174
That why you didn't have to lay in
more rations?

28
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:34,385
I didn't hear no complaints.

29
00:01:34,844 --> 00:01:36,596
JAYNE: How much money? Lots?

30
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:42,644
There's, uh, a chance you might wanna
head back to the ship.

31
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:45,355
I'm all right.
This is entertaining, actually.

32
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:48,775
Yeah? What's entertaining?
I like watching the game.

33
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,861
Plus the other situations.
The key seems to be...

34
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:54,155
giving Jayne a heavy stick
and standing back.

35
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,657
Ha!

36
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:59,202
Still, might ought to clear out
before too much longer.

37
00:01:59,202 --> 00:02:01,204
Seems there's a thief about.
Thief?

38
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,498
Yeah.
Took this right off him.

39
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,209
Now, they earned that with the sweat of
their slave-trading brows.

40
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:09,295
Mal.
Oh, terrible shame.

41
00:02:09,379 --> 00:02:12,132
'Course, they won't discover it till they
go order their next round of drinks.

42
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,384
Wei.
Good drinker, that one.

43
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:44,998
Lovely place.
I'll tell my friends.

44
00:02:50,587 --> 00:02:53,173

45
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,885

55
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:50,730
Seem to you we cleared out
of Santho in a hurry?

56
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,815
Seems to me we do that a lot.

57
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:55,735
Heard tell, though, we're gonna
stay a while on Persephone.

58
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,820
Shiny.
Yeah?

59
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:00,406
Thought you get land crazy
that long in port.

60
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:04,953
Probably, but I've been sane a long while
now, and change is good.

61
00:04:05,703 --> 00:04:08,706
Well, ain't that a joyful sight.

62
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,459
You gotta love a sunset.
Startin' to get familiar too.

63
00:04:11,542 --> 00:04:14,045
Like a second home.
Persephone ain't home.

64
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:17,465
Too many people we need to avoid.
Resupply,

65
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:19,717
look for work, move along.

66
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:21,594
We sniff the air.
We don't kiss the dirt.

67
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,763
Wasn't planning on the dirt kissing, sir.

68
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:26,849
I wouldn't stand for it anyway, Captain,
jealous man like me.

69
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,768
(beeping)
Closing in.

70
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:31,271
ZOE: Planet's coming up
a might fast.

71
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:34,857
That's just 'cause
I'm goin' down too quick.

72
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,859
Likely crash and kill us all.

73
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:40,697
Well, if that happens, let me know.
Okay.

74
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:43,908
Whoa! No, we're good.
(rumbling)

75
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:46,202
We're good. It's okay.

76
00:04:56,629 --> 00:04:59,966
I understand your time
on our planet is limited,

77
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:03,052
and if you selected
my proposal to hear,

78
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:08,891
then the honor you do me
flatters my--my honor.

79
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,768
And I hope--

80
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,314
Now there's the smile
made of sunlight.

81
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,899
Atherton.
How wonderful to see you.

82
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:20,445
Did you get my message?
I was extra appealing.

83
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:22,947
What a flattering invitation.
I had no idea I was arriving in time...

84
00:05:23,031 --> 00:05:24,907
for the social event of the season.

85
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:29,162
So, you'll accompany me?
I ask, heart in my throat.

86
00:05:29,245 --> 00:05:32,040
There's a certain offer
I'm still waiting to hear about

87
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:35,585
(knocking)
Yes, I imagine there is.

88
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,171
I'm delighted to say
I'll be there.

89
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:42,050
Now, I'm sorry, Atherton. I have to run.
No, please. I understand.

90
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,635
I'll see you soon, baobei.

91
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,515
Good afternoon, Captain.
Morning.

92
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,434
We're downing in case Wash don't
kill us all.

93
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,978
Local time's gonna be in the a.m.,
10:00 or so.

94
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:55,521
Yes, I saw that.

95
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,859
Making plans?
Atherton Wing.

96
00:06:00,693 --> 00:06:01,944
Now, he's a regular, ain't he?

97
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:07,283
I've seen him before.
Oh, I never did.

98
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,744
Not what I pictured.
Young.

99
00:06:09,952 --> 00:06:12,205
Must be rich too
to afford your rates.

100
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:15,124
I suppose. He has engaged me
for several days.

101
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,878
Days?
One must have stamina.

102
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:21,089
Mmm. He does.

103
00:06:23,257 --> 00:06:26,094
Well, fine.

104
00:06:27,261 --> 00:06:28,846
Is he lettin' you out at all?

105
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:31,474
Actually, we're attending
a ball tomorrow night.

106
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,726
Tell me, do all the men there
pay for their dates,

107
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,728
or just young rich ones
with stamina?

108
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,231
Most of the women there
will not be Companions,

109
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,941
if that's what you're asking.

110
00:06:40,316 --> 00:06:42,235
Perhaps the other men
couldn't attract one.

111
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,445
Hmm.
It sounds like...

112
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:47,573
the finest party I could imagine
gettin' paid to go to.

113
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:51,285
I don't suppose you'd find it
up to the standards of your outings.

114
00:06:51,744 --> 00:06:56,040
More conversation and somewhat less petty
theft and getting hit with pool cues.

115
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:58,584
Oh.
(chuckles)

116
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:00,920
I understand if you need
to go prepare...

117
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,464
for that "It's 10:00 in the morning"
issue.

118
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:06,134
Yeah.
Better go do that.

119
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:08,886
'Cause I think this is more
of, uh, an evening look.

120
00:07:31,742 --> 00:07:34,871
Ooh. Look at the pretties!

121
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,123
What am I looking at,
the girls or the clothes?

122
00:07:37,415 --> 00:07:39,167
JAYNE: The girls.
The clothes, please.

123
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,422
Say, look at the fluffy one.

124
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,466
ZOE: Too much foofaraw.

125
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,218
If I'm gonna wear a dress,
I want something with some slink.

126
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:51,554
You want a slinky dress?
I can buy you a slinky dress.

127
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,973
Captain, can I have money
for a slinky dress?

128
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:56,434
I'll chip in.
I can hurt you.

129
00:07:56,517 --> 00:08:00,480
The only place I seen something so nice is
some of the things Inara has.

130
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,857
Well, we'd best be movin'.

131
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:05,485
I guess she needs all that stuff,
the life she leads.

132
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:10,490
Well, sure. Sometimes the customers buy
her things. You know, some real rich men.

133
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:12,658
Come on. These ain't feathers
I'm totin' here, you know.

134
00:08:12,742 --> 00:08:16,496
I like the ruffles. Inara gets to wear
whatever she wants.

135
00:08:16,579 --> 00:08:18,623
What are you gonna do
in that rig?

136
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:22,001
Flounce around the engine room?
Be like a sheep walkin' on its hind legs.

137
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,836
JAYNE: (laughs)

138
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,472
See you on the ship, Captain.

139
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:38,851
Ohh.

140
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:45,107
What, is she mad or something?

141
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:55,868
(weapon cocking,
whirring)

142
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,419
Badger.
Captain Reynolds.

143
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,549
Heard you was in town. Thought we might
have a bit of a sit-down.

144
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,509
Prefer a bit of a "piss off."

145
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:15,513
I'm very sorry. Did I give you the
impression I was askin'?

146
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:27,191
Seems to me the last time there was a
chance for a little palaver,

147
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:29,694
we were all manner of unwelcome.

148
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:33,364
This ain't bad.

149
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,576
There's a trick to it.
Wood alcohol.

150
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,120
Now we're favored guests,

151
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:42,665
treated to the finest in beverages
that make you blind.

152
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:45,084
So what is it you need?

153
00:09:45,251 --> 00:09:49,088
Here. Excuse me.
There's a local...

154
00:09:49,463 --> 00:09:51,382
by the name of
Warrick Harrow.

155
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:55,845
Got some property he wants to sell
off-planet. Fetch a high price.

156
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,097
The local powers won't
let him sell off-world.

157
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,309
It's a conundrum. What my man Harrow
needs himself is a smuggler.

158
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,228
Willin' to cut you in on it.
Why me?

159
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:07,064
You have access to ships.
You could do it yourself.

160
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:10,276
Won't deal with me direct.
He's takin' an irrational dislike.

161
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,361
What happened?
He see your face?

162
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,573
He's a quality gent.

163
00:10:15,656 --> 00:10:18,075
Nose in the air like he never--
(speaking Chinese)

164
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,536
Don't find me respectable.
But you--

165
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:22,455
You, I figure, got a chance.

166
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,207
You backed out of a deal last time,
left us hangin'.

167
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:29,045
Hurt our feelings.
You recall why that took place?

168
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:32,006

00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:28,722
I know him, and I think
he's a psychotic lowlife.

339
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:32,142
And I think calling him that is an
insult to the psychotic lowlife community.

340
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:34,269
But the deal is solid.

341
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:38,523
Sorry to interrupt. Sir Warrick, I know
you from the club, I believe.

342
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:43,487
Captain, this is Atherton Wing.
Atherton, Captain Mal Reynolds.

343
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:47,324
Pleased to meet ya. Inara, I didn't
realize you were going to this party.

344
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,327
It's the only party.
And I can see why.

345
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:54,915
How about that floating chandelier?
Almost outshines our girl here.

346
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:01,129
Ath--
Can I call you Ath?

347
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:05,842
Inara has spoken of you to me.
She made a point of your generosity.

348
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:09,388
Given that, I'm sure you won't mind if
ask Inara the favor of a dance?

349
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:14,643
Of course.

350
00:23:24,111 --> 00:23:28,281
You're a brave man.
I know what's mine.

351
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:31,910
This dance I think
I actually know.

352
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,754
Why are you here?
Business. Same as you.

353
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:45,924
I was talking to a contact about a
smuggling job, and you came over to me.

354
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,593
You were staring at me.
I saw you is all.

355
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:50,470
You stand out.

356
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:57,394
In this company, Captain, I believe you're
the one who stands out.

357
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,688
Well, maybe I just want
to see a professional at work.

358
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:01,815
Is this the hardest part,
or does that come later?

359
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:04,234
You have no call trying to make me
ashamed of my job.

360
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:07,154
What I do is legal.
And how's that smuggling coming?

361
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:09,781
My work's illegal,

362
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,116
but at least it's honest.
What?

363
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:13,452
Well, this--
the lie of it.

364
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:16,788
That man parading you around on his arm
as if he actually won you,

365
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,458
as if he loves you, and everyone here
going along with it.

366
00:24:20,584 --> 00:24:22,085
These people like me,
and I like them.

367
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,838
I like Atherton too, by the way.
Well, sure.

368
00:24:24,921 --> 00:24:28,508
What's not to like?
I'm liable to sleep with him myself.

369
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:31,094
And he likes me
whether you see it or not.

370
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:34,514
Of course.
He's made me an offer.

371
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,101
You may think he doesn't honor me,
but he wants me to live here.

372
00:24:38,268 --> 00:24:41,104
I'd be his personal Companion.
I could belong here.

373
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:43,398
Call me pretentious, but there is some
appeal in that.

374
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:47,736
You're right.
Got no call to stop you.

375
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:53,033
You've got the right
to a decent life.

376
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:55,076
I see Kaylee's here.

377
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:57,412
Cried Cinderella tears--
You should have seen her...

378
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:59,873
when I told her she could have
that layer cake she's wearing.

379
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,124
I think she looks adorable.

380
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:04,336
Yeah, but I never said it.

381
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,256
I'm not saying the 80-04 is hard to
repair. It just ain't worth it.

382
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:10,550
It's a fine machine.
You just keep it tuned.

383
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,719
(speaking Chinese)
The extenders ain't braced.

384
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,888
I've been telling him
to buy an 80-10 for years.

385
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,557
Those 'tenders snap off, don't matter
how good the engine's cyclin'.

386
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:19,142
Miss Kaylee, if I could request
the honor--

387
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:21,311
Wait a minute. Let her talk.
She's talkin'.

388
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,230
By the way,
the 80-10's the same machine.

389
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:25,982
They just changed the plating,
hoped no one noticed.

390
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:27,609
(all laughing)

391
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:48,004
Possible you're right. This ain't my
kind of party. Whoa, now.

392
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,215
Watch yourself.
No need for hands on.

393
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:53,552
Excuse me. She's not here with you,
Captain. She's mine.

394
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,179
Yours?
She don't belong to nobody.

395
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,308
Money changed hands,
which makes her mine tonight.

396
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,602
And no matter how you dress her up,
she's still--

397
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,985
Turns out this is my kind of party.
Oh, Mal.

398
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,487
What? The man was out of line.

399
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:15,615
I accept.
That's great. What?

400
00:26:16,032 --> 00:26:19,411
There has been a challenge.
I hope you're prepared, Captain.

401
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,080
What, you all talkin' about a fight?
Well, that's fine.

402
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,583
Let's get out of here.
It's not a fistfight, Mal.

403
00:26:25,083 --> 00:26:27,419
The duel will be met tomorrow morning
at Kaytree Pond.

404
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:29,462
Well, why wait?
Where's that guard?

405
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:31,631
He collected
a whole mess of pistols.

406
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,759
If you require it, any gentleman here can
give you use of a sword.

407
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,554
Use of a sw--what?

408
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:45,812
What's going on?
I'm not rightly sure. What's going on?

409
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,732
Well, first off, you'll be put up in
lodgings for the night,

410
00:26:48,815 --> 00:26:49,774
so you don't disappear.

411
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,736
I wouldn't blame you,
incidentally.

412
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:56,740
Wing may be a spoiled dandy,
but he's an expert swordsman.

413
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,992
He's killed a dozen men
with the long blade.

414
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:01,161
You're the only one
gave him a reason.

415
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,663
Oh, this is a joke.
INARA: You'll need a second.

416
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:07,208
What's that? I'll take on the job.
He fights if you refuse.

417
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:10,462
Inara, come with me, please.

418
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,673
Now, you taking on this job,

419
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,800
being my second--
does this mean we're in business?

420
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,720
It means you're in mortal danger.

421
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:23,892
But you mussed up Atherton's face,
and that has endeared you to me somewhat.

422
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:27,020
You might even give him a fight...
before he guts you.

423
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:28,730
ATHERTON: Inara!

424
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:41,368
Up until the punching,
it was a real nice party.

425
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,538
(breathing heavily)

426
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:54,714
(pounding)

427
00:28:17,987 --> 00:28:20,740
The captain's gone
and got himself in trouble.

428
00:28:21,324 --> 00:28:24,494
A duel?
With swords?

429
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:28,373
The captain's a good fighter.
He must know how to handle a sword.

430
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:30,542
I think he knows
which end to hold.

431
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:34,045
All right, so we just need to figure out
how to get him out of there.

432
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,464
We have until the morning, correct?

433
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:38,883
Do you know what lodging he's in?
Oh!

434
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,386
This is embarrassing.
Some of you seem...

435
00:28:41,469 --> 00:28:43,888
to be misapprehending
my purpose in being here.

436
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:47,142
You're here to make sure we don't do
what these men are keen on doing.

437
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:49,436
Penny for the smart lady.

438
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:51,730
Persephone's my home.

439
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:53,982
I gotta do business
with the people here.

440
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:57,318
I don't want it known I brought someone in
caused this kind of ruckus.

441
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,405
We'll just settle in
till this blows over...

442
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:03,199
one way or the other.
(weapon cocking, whirring)

443
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:10,498
Jayne, I wouldn't.
Why not?

444
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,422
(weapons cocking)
Hi.

445
00:29:37,984 --> 00:29:39,903
Mal?
MAL: Whoa!

446
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,113
What are you doin' here?

447
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:47,744
Atherton's a heavy sleeper
night before a big day.

448
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,413
You know, he's got that killing in the
morning, then a haircut later.

449
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:53,958
Such a comfort having friends
visit at a time like this.

450
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:56,836
(grunts)
I knew the accommodations would be nice.

451
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:58,880
Atherton doesn't skimp.

452
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:02,801
I don't suppose I like being kept by him
as much as others do.

453
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:06,054
So... how come
you're still attached to him?

454
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,723
Because it's my decision,
not yours.

455
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:11,351
Thought he made it pretty clear
he's got no regard for you.

456
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:14,479
You did manage to push him
into saying something, yes.

457
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:16,564
Made a nice justification
for the punch.

458
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:20,568
He insulted you. I hit him.
Seemed like the thing to do.

459
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:23,363
Why'd this get so complicated?

460
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:25,698
Well, it's about to get simpler.

461
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:29,828
There's a back door. The desk clerk
is on alert. He'll let us out.

462
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:33,790
Whoa, I'm not runnin' off. And I don't
know what you got in your head,

463
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:35,416
but I didn't do this to prove
some kind of point to you.

464
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,462
I actually thought I was defending your
honor. And I never back down from a fight.

465
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:42,048
Yes, you do.
You do all the time.

466
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:45,510
Well, yeah. But I'm not backing down
from this one.

467
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:48,096
He's an expert
swordsman, Mal.

468
00:30:48,429 --> 00:30:52,100
You had trouble with the pillar.
How will your death help my honor?

469
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:54,060
Well, see, I plan
on having it be his death.

470
00:30:55,228 --> 00:30:56,604
That's why I need lessons.

471
00:30:57,063 --> 00:31:01,025
I figure you know how, bein' such an
educated woman and all.

472
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,910
He said
not to do anything.

473
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,372
He'll join us after
he wins the duel.

474
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,082
JAYNE:
And what if he don't win?

475
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,501
Doesn't hurt to have
a contingency plan, Kaylee.

476
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,548
I'm thinking
since we're unarmed,

477
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,592
we should take them
by surprise.

478
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:29,095
All at once.
ZOE: Not necessarily.

479
00:31:29,721 --> 00:31:34,267
We can lure one or two of 'em away.
Say, infirmary.

480
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:40,523
Take 'em out, be on Badger
before he knows what happens.

481
00:31:40,523 --> 00:31:43,151
JAYNE: Only if his attention
is elsewhere.

482
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,237
What we need's a diversion.

483
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,616
I say Zoe gets naked.

484
00:31:49,616 --> 00:31:52,201
Nope.
I could get naked.

485
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,161
No!
ZOE: No!

486
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:28,071
River, you can't be here.
(indistinct)

487
00:32:28,196 --> 00:32:29,739
Come on!

488
00:32:30,865 --> 00:32:33,242
River! River, please.
BADGER: Who's that, then?

489
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:41,459
Here, look at me.
What's your story, love?

490
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:44,379
She's just, uh--
just a passenger.

491
00:32:44,379 --> 00:32:47,590
Yeah? Why ain't she talkin'?
She got a secret?

492
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:51,928
No, I'm-- (Cockney accent)
Sure. I got a secret.

493
00:32:52,929 --> 00:32:55,181
More than one.

494
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:58,434
Don't seem likely I tell 'em
to you now, do it?

495
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:02,313
Anyone off Titan colony knows better than
to talk to strangers.

496
00:33:10,697 --> 00:33:13,616
You're talkin' loud enough for the both
of us, though, ain't ya?

497
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:18,079
I've known a dozen like you.
Skipped off-home early.

498
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,915
Minor graft jobs
here and there.

499
00:33:20,915 --> 00:33:23,501
Spent some time in the lockdown,
but less than you claim.

500
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:29,674
Now you're, what, a petty thief
with delusions of standing?

501
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,511
Sad little king
of a sad little hill.

502
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,516
Nice to see someone
from the old homestead.

503
00:33:38,975 --> 00:33:40,560
Not really.

504
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,980
Call me if anyone
interesting shows up.

505
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,902
I like her.

506
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:58,369
That there--exactly the kind of diversion
we could've used.

507
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,372
Attack.

508
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:05,543
(groans)
How did I avoid that?

509
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:08,046
By being fast
like a freak?

510
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:11,382
No. Because you always
attack the same way,

511
00:34:11,758 --> 00:34:13,760
swinging from the shoulder
like you're chopping wood.

512
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:17,847
You have to thrust with the point
sometimes or-or swing from the elbow.

513
00:34:17,930 --> 00:34:21,350
Swinging from the shoulder feels stronger.
It's also slower, Mal.

514
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:24,020
You don't need strength
as much as speed.

515
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,105
We're fragile creatures.

516
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:29,317
It takes less than a pound
of pressure to cut skin.

517
00:34:29,567 --> 00:34:32,945
You know that?
They teach you that in whore academy?

518
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,992
You have a strange sense
of nobility, Captain.

519
00:34:38,534 --> 00:34:40,244
You'll lay a man out for implying I'm a
whore,

520
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:42,955
but you keep calling me one to my face.

521
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:46,250
I might not show respect to your job,
but he didn't respect you.

522
00:34:46,334 --> 00:34:47,668
That's the difference.

523
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:50,088
Inara, he doesn't
even see you.

524
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:53,257
Well, I guess death will solve the issue
to everyone's satisfaction.

525
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:57,261
This (Chinese) duel is the result of the
rules of your society, not mine.

526
00:34:57,345 --> 00:35:00,932
You are always breaking the rules, no
matter what society you're in.

527
00:35:01,808 --> 00:35:03,434
You don't get along
with ordinary criminals either,

528
00:35:03,518 --> 00:35:05,561
which is why you are
constantly getting in trouble.

529
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,022
You think following the rules
will buy you a nice life,

530
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,482
even if the rules
make you a slave.

531
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:13,444
Don't take his offer.

532
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,114
What?

533
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:18,032
Don't do it.

534
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,410
Just in the case that it happens, that
means he's the fellow who killed me,

535
00:35:21,494 --> 00:35:23,746
and I don't like fellows who kill me,
not in general.

536
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,212
I said before that I didn't have call
to stop you, and that's true.

537
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:34,924
Anyways, don't.

538
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:43,349
I need to get back.

539
00:35:46,894 --> 00:35:48,187
He'll be up early.

540
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:52,942
Right. He's got that big day.

541
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:52,418
Best be careful, Ath.
Hear these things are sharp.

542
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:57,423
He thinks he's doing well, doesn't he?
He's being toyed with.

543
00:37:20,529 --> 00:37:22,240
What's he doing?
Don't fall for that!

544
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:31,749
Well, this isn't going to take long,
is it?

545
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:58,985
We're coming up on the end, miss.
You might not want to watch.

546
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,745
Atherton, wait!

547
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:13,666
I'll stay here, exclusive to you.
Just let him live.

548
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:29,640
MAN:
He's down.

549
00:38:32,268 --> 00:38:33,811
You have to finish it, lad.

550
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,026
You have to finish it.

551
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:46,157
For a man to lay beaten and yet breathing,
it makes him a coward.

552
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:49,535
It's humiliation.
Sure.

553
00:38:50,036 --> 00:38:51,579
It would be humiliating,

554
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,541
having to lie there while the better man
refuses to spill your blood.

555
00:38:57,293 --> 00:38:59,754
Mercy is the mark of a great man.

556
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,966
(groans)
Guess I'm just a good man.

557
00:39:05,092 --> 00:39:07,470
(groans)
Well, I'm all right.

558
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:08,888
(drops sword)
(groaning)

559
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:18,814
Inara? Inara!

560
00:39:19,148 --> 00:39:21,067
You've lost her, lad.
Be gracious.

561
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:23,986
You set this up, whore,

562
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:27,073
after I bought
and paid for you.

563
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:31,077
I should've uglied you up,
so no one else would want you.

564
00:39:32,161 --> 00:39:35,873
See how I'm not punching him?
I think I've grown.

565
00:39:36,290 --> 00:39:38,042
Well, get ready to starve.

566
00:39:39,293 --> 00:39:41,670
I'll see to it
you never work again.

567
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,715
Actually,
that's not how it works.

568
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,968
You see, you've earned yourself a black
mark in the client registry.

569
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:51,639
No Companion is going to contract with you
ever again.

570
00:39:52,056 --> 00:39:57,311
You'll have to rely on your winning
personality to get women. God help you.

571
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:04,318
(groans)
Ow, ow.

572
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,237
You didn't have
to wound that man.

573
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,614
Yeah, I know.
It was just funny.

574
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:12,910
You willing to fight that hard
to protect my property,

575
00:40:12,993 --> 00:40:14,954
I'll have it in your hold
before midnight.

576
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,631
Mighty fine shindig.

577
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:37,393
Doc's filling the shepherd in
on the plan.

578
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,311
We're ready to move
on your signal.

579
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,814
Doc is the diversion.

580
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:46,402
Did you ever see
such a lazy crew?

581
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:50,114
Captain!
You're hurt.

582
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:58,747
You get us a deal?
I got a deal. Now get off my ship.

583
00:40:59,498 --> 00:41:01,250
So, very much for
a lovely night then.

584
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,128
(whistles)

585
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:11,177
Ow!
Are you badly hurt?

586
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:12,970
(groans)

587
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,557
We was just about to
spring into action, Captain.

588
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:18,350
Complicated escape
and rescue op.

589
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:21,562
I was gonna watch.
It was very exciting.

590
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,943
♪♪ (humming)

591
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,137
♪♪ (classical)

592
00:42:16,742 --> 00:42:19,995
Thank you for the wine.
It's... very fresh.

593
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:24,208
To Kaylee and her inter-engine
fermentation system.

594
00:42:25,584 --> 00:42:27,378
Are you in pain?
Absolutely.

595
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:30,172
I got stabbed, you know, right here.
I saw.

596
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,384
Don't care much
for fancy parties.

597
00:42:34,051 --> 00:42:37,221
Too rough.
It wasn't entirely a disaster.

598
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:41,725
I got stabbed, right here.
You also lined up exciting new crime.

599
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,604
It's good to have cargo.

600
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,440
Makes us a target for every other
scavenger out there, of course,

601
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:51,902
but sometimes that's fun too.
(chuckles)

602
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,951
I am grateful, you know,
for the ill-conceived...

603
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:02,788
and high-handed attempt to defend my
honor, although I didn't want you to.

604
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:06,875
Gracious as that is,

605
00:43:07,293 --> 00:43:11,505
as I look back... I probably should've
stayed out of your world.

606
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,300
My world?
If it is that.

607
00:43:15,843 --> 00:43:17,344
I wasn't gonna stay,
you know.

608
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:22,266
Yeah? Why's that?

609
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:26,895
Oh, someone needs to keep
Kaylee out of trouble.

610
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,440
And all my things
are here.

611
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:36,405
Besides, why would I want
to leave serenity?

612
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,451
Can't think of a reason.

613
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:43,495
(lowing)

614
00:44:27,665 --> 00:44:29,291
Grr! Arrgh!
