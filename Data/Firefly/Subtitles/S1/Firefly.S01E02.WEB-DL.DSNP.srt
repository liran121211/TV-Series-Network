1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,129
MAN: After the Earth was used up,
we found a new solar system,

2
00:00:04,129 --> 00:00:07,424
and hundreds of new Earths
were terraformed and colonized.

3
00:00:07,716 --> 00:00:09,509
The central planets
formed the Alliance...

4
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:12,512
and decided all the planets
had to join under their rule.

5
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:15,432
There was some disagreement
on that point.

6
00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:18,518
After the war, many of the Independents
who had fought and lost...

7
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,186
drifted to the edges of the system,

8
00:00:20,562 --> 00:00:22,647
far from Alliance control.

9
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:26,026
Out here, people struggled to get by with
the most basic technologies.

10
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,194
A ship would bring you work.

11
00:00:28,361 --> 00:00:30,030
A gun would help you keep it.

12
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:31,865
A captain's goal was simple:

13
00:00:32,073 --> 00:00:34,325
Find a crew, find a job.

14
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:36,161
Keep flying.

15
00:00:37,829 --> 00:00:40,874
(men laughing)
♪♪ (belly dancing music)

16
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:11,905
Your move.

17
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,538
That's a bold move.
I live on the edge.

18
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:32,133
Nice work, dumb ass.
(chuckling)

19
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:35,970
I've given some thought to moving off
the edge. Not an ideal location.

20
00:01:36,262 --> 00:01:38,389
Might get a place in the middle.
MAN: Toast!

21
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:39,682
Toast!

22
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:41,684
Quiet!

23
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,062
Shut up!

24
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:45,063
(music stops)

25
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:48,775
I'm, uh-- I got words.

26
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:52,195
I'm saying this...

27
00:01:52,737 --> 00:01:54,364
is an "ass-picious" day.

28
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:57,408
We all know
what day it is.

29
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,453
Suspicious?
What day is it?

30
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,582
A glorious day for all the proud members
of the allied planets.

31
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:08,086
Unification Day!
MAN: Yeah, yeah.

32
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:11,089
The end of the scumbag independents...

33
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:13,383
and the dawn of a new galaxy.

34
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:16,177
Yeah!
Captain.

35
00:02:18,429 --> 00:02:20,348
Just feel the need
for another drink.

36
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:23,643
What month is it?

37
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:29,607
(speaking Chinese)

38
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:33,736
Hey. You gonna drink
to the Alliance with me?

39
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,364
Six years today,

40
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:38,908
the Alliance sent
the browncoats runnin',

41
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,827
pissin' their pants.

42
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:47,500
You know, your coat is kind of
a brownish color.

43
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:49,669
It was on sale.

44
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,672
You didn't toast.

45
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,593
You know? I'm thinkin' you're one
of them independents.

46
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:01,014
And I'm thinking you weren't burdened with
an overabundance of schooling.

47
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,975
So why don't we just ignore each other
till we go away?

48
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:09,397
The independents were a bunch of cowardly,
inbred piss pots.

49
00:03:09,606 --> 00:03:12,192
Should've been killed
off of every world spinnin'.

50
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:15,486
(glass thumps on counter)
Say that to my face.

51
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:24,871
I said...
you're a coward and a piss pot.

52
00:03:25,955 --> 00:03:27,916
Now, what are you
gonna do about it?

53
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:31,669
Nothin'. I just wanted you to face me
so she could get behind you.

54
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,049
Drunks are so cute.

55
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,014
Oh.
(speaking Chinese)

56
00:03:44,015 --> 00:03:45,183
WOMAN:
Jayne?

57
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,477
Hey, I didn't fight
in no war.

58
00:03:47,685 --> 00:03:49,187
Best o' luck though.

59
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:53,942
Fine. Let's do this.

60
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,573
(shouting)

61
00:04:01,032 --> 00:04:03,993
Wash, we got some
local color happening.

62
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:06,120
Grand entrance
would not go amiss.

63
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:21,344
Is Jayne even awake?

64
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,197
Whoa, whoa. Ha-ha!

65
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:45,034
Oh, ho-ho. There's just an acre
of you fellas, isn't there?

66
00:04:45,618 --> 00:04:48,121
This is why we lost, you know.
Superior numbers.

67
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,081
Thanks for
the reenactment, sir.

68
00:04:50,164 --> 00:04:52,834
JAYNE: Hey, hey.
Them ain't "kosherized" rules.

69
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:56,462
I'm thinkin' somebody
needs to put you down, dog.

70
00:04:57,130 --> 00:05:01,050
What do you think?
I'm thinkin' we'll rise again.

71
00:05:08,224 --> 00:05:10,643
MAN: (over loudspeaker)
Every man there go back inside,

72
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:14,355
or we will blow a new crater
in this little moon.

73
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:31,414
Damn yokels can't even tell a transport
ship ain't got no guns on it.

74
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:36,002
Blow a new crater in this moon.
(laughing)

75
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,965
My thanks, Wash.
Nice save, as always.

76
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:44,677
A pleasure.
And how are our passengers?

77
00:05:45,261 --> 00:05:46,304
They're fine.

78
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,557
So, what happened?
Another terrible brawl?

79
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:52,685
Oddly enough, there was.
Are you getting my wife into trouble?

80
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,396
Wha--
I didn't start it.

81
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:57,648
I just wanted a quiet drink.
Funny, sir,

82
00:05:57,732 --> 00:06:01,194
how you always seem to find yourself in an
Alliance-friendly bar come "U" Day,

83
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,695
looking for a quiet drink.

84
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,989
See, this is another sign
of your tragic space dementia,

85
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:08,493
all paranoid and crotchety--
breaks the heart.

86
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:10,578
Did we at least make a contact?

87
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,747
Ladies and menfolk,
we have ourselves a job.

88
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:17,085
Take us out
of the world, Wash.

89
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:20,797
Got us some crime to be done.

(screaming)
(instruments clattering)

103
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,962
River?

104
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:45,423
River, it's okay.
(sobbing)

105
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,550
It's me.

106
00:07:50,428 --> 00:07:52,221
You know who I am?
(exhales)

107
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:55,391
Simon.

108
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,394
Were you dreaming?

109
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:04,108
Did you dream about the academy?
It's not relevant.

110
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,323
If you can talk about
what happened there--

111
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,826
I know it's hard, but the more I know,
the faster you'll get better.

112
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:17,038
This isn't home?

113
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:20,583
No.

114
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:24,003
No, we can't go home.

115
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,673
If we go home, they'll just send you
back to the academy.

116
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,010
This is safe for now.

117
00:08:36,098 --> 00:08:37,225
We're on a ship.

118
00:08:40,728 --> 00:08:42,522
Midbulk transport.

119
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,316
Standard radion
accelerator core,

120
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:48,236
class-code 03-K64.

121
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:51,239
Firefly.
Well, that's something.

122
00:08:52,949 --> 00:08:54,659
I can't even
remember all that.

123
00:08:58,037 --> 00:08:59,539
SIMON: Need a weave on that?
It's nothin'.

124
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:02,250
I expect that someone's face
feels differently.

125
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:06,003
Well, they tell ya, never hit a man
with a closed fist,

126
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:08,047
but it is, on occasion, hilarious.

127
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:10,091
Hmm. I suppose so.

128
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:13,844
So, the, uh-- the fight didn't...

129
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:17,098
draw any, um, any attention?

130
00:09:17,181 --> 00:09:20,393
No feds. Just an honest brawl
between folk.

131
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:23,312
None of us want the Alliance on us,
Doctor. That's why you're here.

132
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:25,314
I thought I was here
because you needed a medic.

133
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,191
Well, not today.

134
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:33,864
Mal.

135
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,118
Bad.

136
00:09:40,538 --> 00:09:41,622
In the Latin.

137
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,418
Shepherd Book.
Captain.

138
00:09:47,378 --> 00:09:48,379
How's the girl?

139
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:50,298
Still a little whimsical
in the brainpan.

140
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:53,134
Seems calm enough though.
(instruments clattering)

141
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:57,179
SIMON: River.
That young man's very brave.

142
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:59,932
Yeah. He's my hero.

143
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,561
Gave up everything to free
his sister from that place.

144
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:05,980
Go from being a doctor
on the central planets...

145
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:08,316
to hiding on the fringes
of the system.

146
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:10,901
There's not many
would do that.

147
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:12,403
Suppose not.

148
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:15,031
There's not many would
take him in either.

149
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,869
Why did you?
Same reason I took you on board, Shepherd.

150
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:21,579
I need the fare.
(chuckles)

151
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:26,083
There's neither of us can pay a tenth of
what your crew makes on one of your jobs.

152
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:28,919
Are you referring to our perfectly
legitimate business enterprises?

153
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:33,507
I'm wondering why a man so anxious to fly
under Alliance radar...

154
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:35,343
would house known fugitives.

155
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:38,220
The Alliance had her in that institution
for a purpose,

156
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,681
whatever it was, and they will
want her back.

157
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,893
You're not overly fond
of the boy, so why risk it?

158
00:10:44,226 --> 00:10:45,895
Because it's
the right thing to do.

159
00:10:47,021 --> 00:10:48,272
Oh, would you
look at this.

160
00:10:50,608 --> 00:10:51,901
Kaylee!

161
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,487
I'm beginning to wonder if you yourself...
know why you're doing it.

162
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:57,865
What about you, Shepherd? How come you're
flying about with us brigands?

163
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:59,283
I mean,

164
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,745
shouldn't you be off bringing religiosity
to the fuzzy-wuzzies or some such?

165
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:05,581
Oh, I got heathens
aplenty right here.

166
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,418
If I'm your mission, Shepherd,
best give it up.

167
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,253
You're welcome on my boat.

168
00:11:12,463 --> 00:11:13,756
God ain't.

169
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,343
Where in the hell's
that girl?

170
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,562
Do you want me
to put it up?

171
00:11:28,979 --> 00:11:33,067
No, that's okay.
You have such lovely hair.

172
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,945
I'm sure the doctor would agree.

173
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:39,198
Who? Simon?
No, he's much too--

174
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,243
I mean, I'm just--
Do you think it looks better up?

175
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,078
(chuckles)
We can experiment.

176
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,707
We might even get wild later
and wash your face.

177
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,335
You ever do this for your clients?

178
00:11:52,044 --> 00:11:55,715
Very occasionally. Not all of them have
enough hair to get a brush through.

179
00:11:57,133 --> 00:12:00,094
Have you ever had to service
a really hideous client,

180
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:02,096
with boils and the like?

181
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,390
A Companion chooses
her own clients.

182
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,725
That's guild law.

183
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,353
But physical appearance
doesn't matter so terribly.

184
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,981
You look for
compatibility of spirit.

185
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:15,693
There's an energy about a person
that's difficult to hide.

186
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:17,069
You try to feel that--
And then you...

187
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,029
try to feel the energy
of their credit account.

188
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,948
It has a sort of aura.

189
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,159
What did I say to you about barging into
my shuttle?

190
00:12:24,034 --> 00:12:26,495
That it was manly and impulsive?

191
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,415
Yes, precisely. Only the exact phrase
I used was "Don't."

192
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,835
Well, you're holding my mechanic in
thrall, and, Kaylee,

193
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,587
what's going on in the engine room?

194
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:37,882
Were there monkeys? Some terrifying space
monkeys maybe got loose?

195
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:39,592
I had to rewire the grav thrust...

196
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,595
because somebody won't replace
that crappy compression coil.

197
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:44,263
Get the place squared away.

198
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:47,433
It's dangerous in there, and I ain't
payin' you to get your hair played at.

199
00:12:48,267 --> 00:12:50,060
(speaking Chinese)

200
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,729
We work
before we play.

201
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,568
You're servicing crew now?

202
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,945
(snickers)
In your lonely, pathetic dreams.

203
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,281
What do you want?

204
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:06,619
We have a job. Congratulations.

205
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,538
This job wouldn't be on
a decently civilized planet...

206
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:11,916
where I could screen some
respectable clients, perhaps?

207
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:14,543
"Respectable clients."
That seems a contradiction.

208
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,295
Don't start.

209
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,800
There's, um--

210
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,929
We haven't got a location yet.

211
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,890
We'll be landing
on a skyplex in a bit.

212
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,351
Run by a fella called Niska.
Never heard of him.

213
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:34,480
Well, I have, and while we're there,
you'll stay confined to the ship.

214
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:38,400
Is the petty criminal perchance ashamed
to be riding with a Companion?

215
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,028
Niska has
a very unlovely rep.

216
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:44,073
He's got work for me,
fine. But I don't--

217
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,159
I'm not sure
you'd be safe.

218
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:50,412
Mal, if you're being a gentleman,
I may die of shock.

219
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,122
Hmm.

220
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:58,254
Have you got time to do my hair?
Out.

221
00:14:19,817 --> 00:14:22,528
MAN: He's fine.
Crow, they can come in.

222
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,828
Eh, Malcolm Reynolds
is which?

223
00:14:30,911 --> 00:14:34,748
I'm Captain Reynolds. My first mate Zoe.
This is Jayne.

224
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,625
Very nice.

225
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:40,796
I am Adelai Niska.
You have seen Crow.

226
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,174
He loves to stand
at the door to say, "Boo!"

227
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,510
We got word you might
have a job for us.

228
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:50,681
Yes!
Yes, an exciting job.

229
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,142
A train...

230
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,145
has, uh, something I need.

231
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,981
You have worked
a train before?

232
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:00,357
We did a few.

233
00:15:00,691 --> 00:15:03,986
Are you going to ask me what it is I need?

234
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,779
As a rule, no.

235
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:09,325
Yes. Good.
You have reputation.

236
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:12,036
"Malcolm Reynolds gets it done"
is the talk.

237
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:12,870
Well, glad to hear that.

238
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:16,206
You know what is reputation?

239
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:19,668
Is people talking.

240
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:23,255
Is gossip. Uh--

241
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:28,886
I also have reputation.
Not so pleasant, I think you know. Crow.

242
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:41,440
Now, for you, my reputation
is not from gossip.

243
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:45,945
You see this man?
Uh, he does not do the job.

244
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,489
I show you
what I do with him,

245
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:52,159
and now my reputation
for you is fact.

246
00:15:52,534 --> 00:15:54,036
Is solid.

247
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:01,377
You do the train job
for me.

248
00:16:01,752 --> 00:16:04,088
Then you are solid.

249
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:08,884
No more gossip.
Right.

250
00:16:09,885 --> 00:16:13,138
Ooh. You do not like
I kill this man.

251
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,182
Hmm. Oh, no.
I'm sure he was a...

252
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,309
very bad person.

253
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,062
My wife's nephew.

254
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,398
At dinner
I'm getting earful.

255
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,441
There is
no way out of that.

256
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:28,404
So--Oh!
The train job.

257
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:29,863
Come in.

258
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,660
Here, in fifth car,
two boxes.

259
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:38,914
Alliance goods. You don't mind taking
from Alliance, I think.

260
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:41,250
From your reputation?

261
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:48,924
You get on train at Hancock,
headed for Paradiso.

262
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:52,094
You take boxes off
before you reach Paradiso...

263
00:16:52,094 --> 00:16:56,098
and deliver to Crow... here.

264
00:16:56,432 --> 00:17:00,185
Half money now. Crow give you other half
at rendezvous point.

265
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:05,816
Anything goes wrong, then your reputation
only gossip...

266
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,861
and things between us...

267
00:17:08,986 --> 00:17:10,863
not so solid.

268
00:17:11,488 --> 00:17:12,573
Yes?

269
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,510
How long till we hit Paradiso?
Another 20 minutes.

270
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:35,929
We should be in the foothills
in five.

271
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,890
Let's get to work.

272
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:42,311
He's a psycho, you know.
Niska.

273
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:44,438
He's not the first psycho
to hire us.

274
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,649
Nor the last. You think that's
a commentary on us?

275
00:17:48,108 --> 00:17:50,819
I just have an image in my head of a guy
hanging from the ceiling.

276
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,572
I got an image of it not being me.
Let's do the thing.

277
00:18:07,669 --> 00:18:08,629
Hi.

278
00:18:19,515 --> 00:18:21,517
Shepherd.

279
00:18:22,017 --> 00:18:23,477
Good day.

280
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,022
(sighs)

281
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:31,110
So... how do you
think it's going?

282
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,486
The caper?

283
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,156
Mal knows what he's doing.

284
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,493
How long
have you known him?

285
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,578
I've been on this ship
eight months now.

286
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:44,289
I'm not certain I'll ever actually know
the captain.

287
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,166
(chuckles)

288
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:51,255
I'm surprised a respectable Companion
would sail with this crew.

289
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:53,132
It's not always this sort of work.

290
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:56,051
They take the jobs they can get,
even legitimate ones.

291
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:59,680
But the further you get away from the
central planets, the harder things are,

292
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,223
so this is part of it.

293
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:03,892
I wish I could help.

294
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:09,231
I mean,
I don't wanna help--

295
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:12,192
Not help help, but--
Not with the thieving, but--

296
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:16,071
I do feel awfully useless.

297
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:20,409
You could always pray
they make it back safely.

298
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,787
I don't think the captain
would much like me praying for him.

299
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,290
Don't tell him.

300
00:19:29,209 --> 00:19:30,627
I never do.

301
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:45,017
Go on straight through.

302
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,145
WOMAN:
Keep moving.

303
00:19:57,404 --> 00:20:00,282
Sir, is there some information
we might maybe be lacking...

304
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:03,368
as to why there's an entire fed squad
sitting on this train?

305
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,288
Doesn't concern us.
It kind of concerns me.

306
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:08,332
I mean, they're not
protecting the goods.

307
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,792
If they were, they wouldn't be
letting people past them.

308
00:20:10,876 --> 00:20:12,628
You don't think that changes
the situation a bit?

309
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,129
I surely do.

310
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,173
Makes it more fun.

311
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:19,468
Sir, I think you have a problem with
your brain being missing.

312
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:22,930
Come on.
We stick to the plan.

313
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:26,433
We get the goods. We're back on Serenity
before the train even reaches Paradiso.

314
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:30,187
Only now we do it under the noses
of 20 trained Alliance feds.

315
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,397
And that makes them look
all manner of stupid.

316
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,524
Hell, this job
I would pull for free.

317
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,568
Then can I have your share?
No.

318
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:38,362
If you die, can I have your share?
Yes.

319
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,043
Hey.
Oh.

320
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,170
Hey, Doctor.

321
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:57,339
You really should
just call me Simon.

322
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:00,133
Oh, I'll do that then.

323
00:21:01,969 --> 00:21:04,805
So... what
are we doing?

324
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:08,183
Oh, crime.
Crime.

325
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:10,102
Good.

326
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,729
Okay. Crime.

327
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,690
It's a train heist.

328
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:17,985
See, we fly over the train car.
The captain and Zoe sneak in.

329
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,445
We lower Jayne
onto the car,

330
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:23,532
and they bundle up the booty,
and we haul 'em all back up.

331
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:25,951
Easy as lyin'.

332
00:21:26,451 --> 00:21:29,579
So you've done this before.
(laughs) Hell, no.

333
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:31,456
But I think it's gonna work.

334
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:34,543
The captain (speaking Chinese)
when it comes to plans.

335
00:21:35,294 --> 00:21:39,548
Uh, is--You know, is there anything I
can-- something I should be doing?

336
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,591
Staying the hell
out of everyone's way.

337
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,260
No call to be snappy, Jayne.

338
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:46,138
Are you about to jump onto
a moving train?

339
00:21:46,388 --> 00:21:48,598
Captain ain't around. I'm in charge.
Since when?

340
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:51,643
Just 'cause Mal says you're medic don't
make you part of the crew.

341
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:53,562
You just play at figurin'
what's wrong...

342
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:56,565
with that moon-brained
sister of yours till we call for you.

343
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,317
Dong ma?

344
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,112
Right.

345
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:08,201
(motor whirring)

346
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:10,704
You shouldn't be
so rude to him.

347
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:13,248
Why? 'Cause he's all rich and "fancible"?
He's not rich.

348
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,460
The Alliance crashed his accounts
when he snuck out his sister.

349
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:20,672
Yeah, well, we could all be rich
if we handed her back.

350
00:22:22,132 --> 00:22:23,633
You're not even
thinking that.

351
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,970
Mal is.
That's not funny.

352
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,597
JAYNE:
He ain't stupid.

353
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:32,392
Why would he take on trouble like those
two if there weren't no profit in it, hmm?

354
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:35,270
Captain's got a move he ain't made yet.
You'll see.

355
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:40,442
Time for some thrilling heroics.

356
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,653
Niska's sources
better be good.

357
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:48,992
Shining.

358
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:51,536
(grunting)

359
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:54,039
(groaning)

360
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,365
Find the cargo.

361
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:40,627
All hail
the great Alliance.

362
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,360
(grunts)

363
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,493
(weapon cocking)

364
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,347
Fifteen seconds.

365
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,113
(yells)
Go!

366
00:24:50,280 --> 00:24:52,949
Go! Go now!

367
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,962
Come on.

368
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:09,758
(engines accelerating)

369
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:17,891
(murmuring)

370
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:25,190
(shouting, coughing)

371
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,114
Aaah! God!
Where are the others?

372
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:35,408
They shot my gorram leg!
Jayne.

373
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:38,245
Are they still on the train?
Are they gonna be okay?

374
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:41,164
FED: Everybody off!
(people chattering)

375
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,625
Come on, come on.
Everybody off!

376
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,045
This way.

377
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:53,301
FED:
Move it.

378
00:26:01,643 --> 00:26:03,186
Our man
didn't get a look.

379
00:26:03,687 --> 00:26:05,480
Well, geez. Can someone find out
what they took?

380
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,901
MAN: Randy!
Keep those people together!

381
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,195
Quiet 'em down!

382
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:14,573
It was the medicine, sir.
All of the supplies.

383
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:17,617
They stole
the gorram medicine?

384
00:26:18,910 --> 00:26:20,996
We've been waitin'.
All of it?

385
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:23,039
WOMAN:
Every ounce.

386
00:26:23,123 --> 00:26:25,875
(crying)
It's all right.

387
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:27,836
Oh, God help us.

388
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:32,924
Son of a bitch.

389
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:47,147
MAN: What's the fuss?
WOMAN: All-network alert. Cargo theft.

390
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:51,026
Medical shipment lifted off a train in the
Georgia system en route to Paradiso.

391
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:53,236
Six crates
of Pescaline "D".

392
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:56,865
Right. That'll get you a tidy fortune
on the black market.

393
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:59,534
Tag it received, bounce it back.
Locals can deal with it.

394
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,370
Sir, there is a regiment
holding in Paradiso.

395
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,414
They were on the train
headed to the installation.

396
00:27:04,497 --> 00:27:06,583
Then get them back on the train
and get it moving.

397
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:07,584
Who's holding them there?

398
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,961
The sheriff requested a few
to help him investigate--

399
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:13,214
These are federal marshals,
not local narcotic hounds.

400
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,425
They've got
better things to do,

401
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,302
and so do we.

402
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,473
JAYNE:
Gorrammit, let's get us movin'!

403
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:23,600
SIMON: Now, I'm not--
I'm not finished.

404
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:25,685
Why you got us parked here?
This ain't the rendezvous spot.

405
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:26,645
It is now.

406
00:27:26,728 --> 00:27:28,688
Niska's people are waitin'.
They're not partial to waitin'.

407
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:32,567
Let 'em read a magazine. We don't make the
sale until Mal and Zoe are back.

408
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:35,236
These are stone killers.
They ain't cuddly like me.

409
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:37,322
I'm not flying anywhere
without my wife.

410
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,783
She'll be okay.
She's with the captain.

411
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:42,786
There. You see?
Everybody wins. Aaah!

412
00:27:43,328 --> 00:27:47,290
Doc, I need a pop to quiet this pain some!
(grunts)

413
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:49,959
All right, but what about
the authorities?

414
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:52,379
We're sitting here
with stolen Alliance goods.

415
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:53,630
Won't they be looking for us?

416
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,424
If they buzz this canyon, we'll
hear 'em before they see us.

417
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,760
I figure we're good for a--
RIVER: They won't stop.

418
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:00,136
They'll never stop.

419
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:05,225
They'll just keep coming
until they get back what you took.

420
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:09,479
Two by two.

421
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:11,356
Hands of blue.

422
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:15,485
Two by two.

423
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,946
Hands of blue.

424
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:21,032
How's about you shut that crazy mouth!
Is that a fun game?

425
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,785
Now, I'm in charge here,
and I'm tellin' you how it works.

426
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:27,497
We don't get the goods to Niska on time,
he'll make meat pies outta the lot of us!

427
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,998
I ain't walkin' into that.

428
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,209
This Adelai Niska
you're talkin' about?

429
00:28:33,461 --> 00:28:35,839
Now, how would a shepherd
know a name like that?

430
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:39,509
As I've heard it,
he made a deal with the captain.

431
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,720
If the captain's not there
to finish it,

432
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,596
if Niska finds out
he's being held...

433
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,516
and may speak
as to who hired him,

434
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:50,311
I think we're better off
being a little late.

435
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:53,606
(people coughing)

436
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:59,946
This is a nightmare.
Nothing points to us yet, sir.

437
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:01,823
That ain't
what I'm talkin' about.

438
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:04,743
(wailing)

439
00:29:09,122 --> 00:29:11,708
Whatever happens,
remember I love you.

440
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:15,086
Sir?
Because you're my wife.

441
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:17,297
Right... sir.

442
00:29:17,547 --> 00:29:19,424
Honey.

443
00:29:19,841 --> 00:29:23,428
Car three, row 12.
Mr. and Mrs. Raymond.

444
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,139
Can you tell us what's going on?
We've been here for so long.

445
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:29,017
Did someone on the train get killed?
No, no, no, no.

446
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:31,686
Nothin' like that. Uh--

447
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:36,024
Says there your fare's
paid for by a third party?

448
00:29:36,024 --> 00:29:38,735
My uncle. It was
a wedding gift.

449
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:40,403
Wedding gift.

450
00:29:45,658 --> 00:29:47,702
Spending your honeymoon
in Paradiso?

451
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:50,038
Actually, we're here
looking for work.

452
00:29:50,121 --> 00:29:51,706
That right?
My uncle said...

453
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,376
he knew a Joey Bloggs out here,
said he might have an opening.

454
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,836
Thought we'd try our luck.

455
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:00,215
You a miner by trade?
Either of you?

456
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:01,466
No.
Not really.

457
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:02,926
Hmm.

458
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:06,429
Haven't seen many folk choose
this life weren't born to it.

459
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:09,474
Well, work is real scarce
for a couple just startin' out.

460
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,936
How come there's
so many sick here?

461
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:16,815
Bowden's malady.
Know what that is?

462
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:20,944
Affliction of the bone
and muscle. Degenerative.

463
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:22,695
Very.

464
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:26,157
Every planet that's been
terra-formed for human life...

465
00:30:26,241 --> 00:30:28,660
has its own little quirks.

466
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:32,121
Turns out the, uh,
air down underground,

467
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:34,874
mixed up
with the ore processors--

468
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:38,336
Perfect recipe
for Bowden's.

469
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,129
Everybody gets it.

470
00:30:40,213 --> 00:30:41,714
Miners, dumpers.

471
00:30:42,298 --> 00:30:45,051
Hell, I got it. I ain't ever
set foot in a mine.

472
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,053
But it's treatable.

473
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:51,850
There's medicine.
Pescaline.

474
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,602
At least you can live like a person,
you get it regular,

475
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:59,482
but our shipment got stole
right off the train you was ridin' in.

476
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:03,027
Which is why you won't be
seein' a parade in town today.

477
00:31:03,486 --> 00:31:04,737
Stolen.

478
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:07,198
Well, didn't I see
an entire regiment...

479
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:10,368
of fine, young Alliance federals
on the train?

480
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,287
You did.

481
00:31:12,495 --> 00:31:16,374
Same regiment let their medicine get
swiped right outfrom under their noses,

482
00:31:16,457 --> 00:31:20,169
then took off for their own camp without
so much as a whoopsy-daisy.

483
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,297
That sounds like
the Alliance.

484
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,840
Unite all the planets
under one rule...

485
00:31:23,923 --> 00:31:26,885
so that everybody can be interfered with
or ignored equally.

486
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:32,015
Alliance ain't much use to us
out here on the border planets,

487
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:37,228
but... they ain't the ones
who stole the medicine.

488
00:31:38,187 --> 00:31:39,272
I ever find
those people,

489
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,608
they ain't ever gonna see
the inside of a jail.

490
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:44,694
I'm just gonna
toss 'em in a mine,

491
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:47,864
let 'em breathe deep
for the rest of their lives.

492
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:51,993
Can't argue with that.
Hmm.

493
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:55,830
(groans)
You mind tellin' me, uh, when it was...

494
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:57,874
you last spoke to Joey Bloggs?

495
00:31:59,792 --> 00:32:02,462
Never did myself.
Right. Your uncle.

496
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:07,842
Now, it was indicated to you
that, uh, Joey had an opening?

497
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,594
Any job would do.

498
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:14,641
That's funny your uncle never went to
mentioning the Bowden's problem,

499
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:16,768
or that Joey Bloggs...

500
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:19,312
ate his own gun
about eight months back.

501
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:22,440
Did he?
Yep.

502
00:32:23,566 --> 00:32:25,985
Blew the back
of his head right off.

503
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:31,658
So... would his job
be open?

504
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:34,577
That's it!
We waited long enough.

505
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:36,663
Let's get this bird in the air.
No rutting way.

506
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:39,415
SIMON: You should sit down.
We can't leave the captain and Zoe.

507
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,668
They ain't comin', we can't walk in there
and get 'em, so they're done.

508
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:42,710
Let's fire it up.

509
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,629
What's going on?
Strap in. We're takin' off.

510
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:47,215
We're not.
Captain'd do the same if it were us.

511
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:48,591
Not in a million years!
Shut it.

512
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:51,302
Listen to me.
You know what the chain of command is?

513
00:32:51,386 --> 00:32:52,553
It's a chain I go get and beat you with

514
00:32:52,637 --> 00:32:54,764
till you understand who's in rutting
command here.

515
00:32:55,098 --> 00:32:56,432
Now, we're finishing
this deal,

516
00:32:56,891 --> 00:33:00,853
and then maybe, maybe we'll come back
for those morons,

517
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,814
got themselves caught.

518
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:08,111
You can't change that
by gettin' all... "bendy."

519
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:09,529
All what?

520
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:15,493
You got the--the light from the console...
to keep you--

521
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:18,705
lift you up.
(chuckles)

522
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,457
Oh, they shine like...

523
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,752
little angels.

524
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:32,343
Did he just go crazy
and fall asleep?

525
00:33:32,635 --> 00:33:34,512
I told him
to sit down.

526
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:37,890
You doped him.

527
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,851
It was supposed to kick in
a good deal sooner.

528
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:42,979
I--I just didn't feel comfortable
with him in charge.

529
00:33:43,062 --> 00:33:45,398
I hope that's all right.

530
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:49,068
So, how do we get the others?

531
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:52,822
Jayne was right about them
not making contact.

532
00:33:52,822 --> 00:33:55,158
Chances are they got pinched
gettin' off that train.

533
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,702
We can't just waltz in
and pull 'em out.

534
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:00,329
Someone respectable enough
might be able to.

535
00:34:11,841 --> 00:34:14,469
What the hell--
Don't you dare speak to me!

536
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:17,513
Sheriff, I want this man
bound by law at once.

537
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,515
That's assuming
he hasn't been already.

538
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,684
No one's been bound.
Not yet.

539
00:34:21,768 --> 00:34:23,644
Thank God
you stopped them.

540
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:27,231
Did you honestly think you could access
my accounts and I wouldn't find you?

541
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:30,735
And, Zoe, what would your husband say
if he knew you were here?

542
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,739
I--I was weak.

543
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,658
So I take it
they ain't newlyweds.

544
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,118
(scoffs)
Hardly.

545
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:43,790
Malcolm's my indentured man
with three years left in his debt.

546
00:34:44,123 --> 00:34:48,419
I imagine we'll have to add another six
months after this little adventure.

547
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:52,048
(murmuring)

548
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:57,345
Pardon them. Don't think a one of 'em's
ever seen a registered Companion before.

549
00:34:57,345 --> 00:34:59,347
I apologize for my manner.

550
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,808
SHERIFF: Not a bit.
Should I contact my ship?

551
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:03,184
Do you need to hold them
very much longer?

552
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,937
Looks to me like
we're about done here.

553
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,648
We had some, uh,
unrelated trouble.

554
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,150
His story had kind of an odor to it.
Yes.

555
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,778
It's not the only thing
about him that does.

556
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,532
Thank you
very much, Sheriff.

557
00:35:18,991 --> 00:35:21,911
Come along.

558
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:34,882
That's a hell of a lady.

559
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:38,344
(door closes)
Her files were all in order?

560
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,596
I ran 'em twice.

561
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,434
Huh. Let's get started
with the rest then.

562
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,946
Hey.
How'd it go?

563
00:35:56,946 --> 00:35:58,865
She hit me.

564
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:06,622
We tried to get him into the infirmary.
He's just heavy.

565
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:10,251
Kept the engine running. We're good to go.
We're not going.

566
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:12,170
Not--What?
Not--Why?

567
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:15,047
We're bringing the cargo back.
What?

568
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:18,176
What do you mean, "back"?
I waited for you guys!

569
00:36:18,467 --> 00:36:20,845
WASH: What are you talking about?
What about Niska?

570
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:23,472
Won't this put him in more or less
a killing mood?

571
00:36:23,556 --> 00:36:25,141
There's others need this more.

572
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:27,351
Let's get it on the mule.
My shuttle's faster.

573
00:36:27,435 --> 00:36:31,355
You risked enough flying in there once.
And I don't want to get slapped no more.

574
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,399
Far as Niska goes,
we'll explain to him...

575
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:35,985
the job went south
when we return the money.

576
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:38,196
You wanna explain,
now's your chance.

577
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:57,465
You didn't make
the rendezvous.

578
00:36:57,590 --> 00:36:59,842
Ran into
a few complications.

579
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:03,137
You are thinking of taking
Mr. Niska's money...

580
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:04,430
and his property maybe.

581
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:08,059
Uh, interestingly, neither.
I don't understand.

582
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:11,354
Yeah. Look. Here's what it is.
Deal's off.

583
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:15,816
We changed our minds.

584
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:19,111
You entered into an arrangement
with Mr. Niska.

585
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:22,698
There is no mind changing.
I'm afraid that's where you're wrong.

586
00:37:22,990 --> 00:37:24,951
We--We just--

587
00:37:25,284 --> 00:37:28,079
We can't take this job.
So you just relax.

588
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:31,958
We'll get you the money Niska gave us,
you return it, and we'll call it even.

589
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:33,960
There is no even.

590
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,837
Is that right?

591
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:25,720
(gunshot)
(groaning)

592
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,768
Nice shot.

593
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,855
I was aimin' for his head.

594
00:38:51,245 --> 00:38:53,080
We'll have to
drag 'em from here.

595
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,583
We can leave 'em
just off the street.

596
00:38:55,833 --> 00:38:58,169
Notify the sheriff once we're in deep,
deep space.

597
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:00,379
Why not tell him
in person?

598
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:05,926
SHERIFF: Got word of a ship not far out.

599
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:08,012
Came lookin'.

600
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:14,352
Didn't expect
to find you comin' back.

601
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,812
Didn't expect
to be comin'.

602
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,773
Nothin' missin'.

603
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:29,325
You were truthful back in town.
These are tough times.

604
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:32,745
A man can get a job.

605
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:35,873
He might not look too close
at what that job is.

606
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:40,920
But a man learns all the details
of a situation like ours,

607
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:45,132
well... then he has a choice.

608
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,428
I don't believe he does.

609
00:39:54,308 --> 00:39:57,978
Let's get these crates back to town,
make ourselves useful.

610
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:16,539
(engines starting)

611
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,333
Now, this is all the money
Niska gave us in advance.

612
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:22,711
You bring it back to him. Tell him the job
didn't work out. (spits)

613
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:25,923
We're not thieves.
But we are thieves.

614
00:40:26,006 --> 00:40:28,134
Point is, we're not taking what's his.

615
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:31,220
We'll stay out of his way
as best we can from here on in.

616
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:35,266
You explain that's best
for everyone. Okay?

617
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:41,147
Keep the money.
Use it to buy a funeral.

618
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:46,318
It doesn't matter where you go
or how far you fly.

619
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:51,907
I will hunt you down, and the last thing
you see will be my blade.

620
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,327
Darn.

621
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:04,795
Now this is all the money Niska gave us--
I get it. I'm good.

622
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,339
Best thing for everyone.
I'm right there with you.

623
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:21,437
You should've let me
do this sooner.

624
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:25,065
I've had plenty worse.
It's just--Ow!

625
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:26,942
Sorry.
Just be careful.

626
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,905
Pretty fast thinkin',
dopin' up Jayne.

627
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:34,200
Can't say you made
a lifetime friend.

628
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:35,618
I'll deal with him.

629
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:38,329
Yeah, I'm not
too worried about you.

630
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:42,708
How's your sister?
The same.

631
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:46,086
One moment she seems perfectly cogent,
the next,

632
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:49,298
she speaks nonsense.

633
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,842
SIMON: It's like a child.

634
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:55,971
So difficult to diagnose.
RIVER: Two by two.

635
00:41:56,138 --> 00:41:59,058
I still don't know what the government
was trying to do with her.

636
00:41:59,308 --> 00:42:01,685
Hands of blue. Two...
So I have no idea

637
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:04,230
by two.
if they succeeded.

638
00:42:05,731 --> 00:42:08,859
Hands of blue.

639
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,778
Two by two.

640
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:13,697
Hands of blue.

641
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,492
Sorry to keep you waiting. There's always
one crisis--

642
00:42:16,575 --> 00:42:20,120
We're not interested.
We're here about a theft.

643
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,123
The medicine.
On that planet.

644
00:42:23,123 --> 00:42:24,833
Word came up that was returned.
We didn't fly...

645
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:29,129
86 million miles to track down a box
of Band-Aids, Colonel.

646
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,923
We're looking for a girl.

647
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,842
This girl.

648
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:15,092
Grr! Arrgh!
