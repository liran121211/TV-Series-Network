00:00:01,167 --> 00:00:04,421
BOOK: After the Earth was used up,
we found a new solar system

2
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:07,841
and hundreds of new Earths
were terraformed and colonized.

3
00:00:08,049 --> 00:00:09,926
The Central Planets
formed the Alliance...

4
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:13,054
and decided all the planets
had to join under their rule.

5
00:00:13,138 --> 00:00:15,932
There was some disagreement
on that point.

6
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:19,102
After the war, many of the independents
who had fought and lost...

7
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:23,106
drifted to the edges of the system,
far from Alliance control.

8
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:26,735
Out here, people struggled to get by with
the most basic technologies.

9
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:30,780
A ship would bring you work.
A gun would help you keep it.

10
00:00:30,780 --> 00:00:32,282
A captain's goal was simple--

11
00:00:32,365 --> 00:00:36,244
Find a crew.
Find a job. Keep flying.

12
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:56,264
Hyah!
Whoa!

13
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:02,270
Pardon me for intruding,

14
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:05,315
but I believe y'all are
carrying something of mine.

15
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:06,858
'Tain't your'n.

16
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:09,861
Did you think we wouldn't find out
you changed your route?

17
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:13,364
You gonna give us what's due us and every
damn thing else on that boat.

18
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:17,577
And I think maybe you gonna give me a
little one-on-one time with the missus.

19
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:21,956
Oh, I think you might want to reconsider
that last part.

20
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:25,335
See, I married me
a powerful ugly creature.

21
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:28,880
How can you say that? How can you shame me
in front of new people?

22
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:31,091
If I could make you prettier,
I would.

23
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:34,177
You are not the man
I met a year ago.

24
00:01:36,346 --> 00:01:38,181
(horse whinnying)

25
00:01:38,473 --> 00:01:40,225
Now, think real hard.

26
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:43,436
You been bird-doggin'
this township a while now.

27
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,855
They wouldn't mind a corpse of you.

28
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,983
You can luxuriate in a nice jail cell,

29
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:52,612
but if your hand touches metal,
I swear by my pretty floral bonnet,

30
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:55,198
I will end you.

31
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:00,537
Take him!
(grunts)

32
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,801
♪♪ (fiddles: upbeat)

33
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:16,094
MAN: Yoo-hoo!
MAL: In the morning,

34
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,178
we'll head for Beaumond.

35
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,930
Give you a chance to find some work of
your own.

36
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:20,265
I appreciate it.

37
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:24,394
This is lovely, but--
Not your clientele? I understand.

38
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:27,105
You gotta play at being a lady.
Well, yes.

39
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:30,775
So, explain to me again
why Zoe wasn't in the dress.

40
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:33,528
Tactics, woman.
Needed her in the back.

41
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,657
Besides, those soft cotton dresses feel
kinda nice. There's a whole airflow.

42
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,617
And you'd know
that because--

43
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,078
You can't open the book of my life
and jump in the middle.

44
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:44,038
Like woman, I'm a mystery.

45
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:47,333
Oh, best keep it that way.
I withdraw the question.

46
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:50,670
(people whooping)

47
00:02:53,298 --> 00:02:56,759
It makes the rain come
when you turn it.

48
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,804
(rattling)
The rain's very scarce.

49
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:02,807
Comes only when needed most.

50
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:06,394
And such it is... with men like you.

51
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:10,273
This is the most--

52
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:13,776
You--friend.

53
00:03:15,778 --> 00:03:18,364
You're the guy!
(sniffles)

54
00:03:20,742 --> 00:03:22,327
I'll treasure this.

55
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:26,539
(woman laughing)

56
00:03:55,944 --> 00:03:57,487
(no audible dialogue)

57
00:04:22,011 --> 00:04:25,056
Elder Gommen, thank you
for the hospitality.

58
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:27,267
We owe you a great debt.

59
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,727
I'm sorry we have
so little to pay it with,

60
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:32,105
though I hope our gifts
will show our regard.

61
00:04:32,188 --> 00:04:34,315
I don't think Jayne's ever lettin' go
of that stick.

62
00:04:34,607 --> 00:04:35,817
(chuckling)

63
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,152
Alliance patrol boat heading into atmo
right now.

64
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,238
Well, we gotta fly.

65
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,864
We'll pray for a safe voyage...

66
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,535
and hope to lay eyes on you again ere
too long, my friend.

67
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:48,663
Count on it. Bye, now.
Bless you.

68
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:51,291
Bye!
Bye bye!

69
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,376
Good-bye!
Be well! Bye, now.

70
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,393
Yaah!

71
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:15,523
Who the hell are you?
What do you mean?

72
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:18,568
Well I think I was pretty clear.
What are you doing on my boat?

73
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:23,740
You know I'm to cleave to you.

74
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:25,992
To "wubba" who?

75
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,495
Did Elder Gommen
not tell you?

76
00:05:30,121 --> 00:05:32,832
Tell me what?
Wh--Who are you?

77
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,419
Mr. Reynolds, sir,

78
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:38,296

00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:44,779
I am your wife.

92
00:06:45,196 --> 00:06:49,450
That was your agreement with Elder Gommen
since he hadn't cash or livestock--

93
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:52,120
I-I'm sorry.

94
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:54,997
Go back to the part
where you're my wife.

95
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:57,291
I don't please you?

96
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,336
You can't please me. You never met me.
Zoe, why do I have a wife?

97
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:04,257
You got a wife? All I got was that
dumb-ass stick sounds like it's rainin'.

98
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,384
How come you got a wife?
I didn't.

99
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:10,138
We're not married.
I'm sorry that I shame you.

100
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:13,141
You don't shame me.
Zoe, would you get Wash?

101
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,353
(echoing over p.a.)
This is Zoe.

102
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,565
We need all personnel in the cargo bay.
"All"? I said Wash.

103
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:24,360
Captain, everyone should have a chance to
congratulate you on your day of bliss.

104
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:26,737
There's There's no bliss.
I don't know this girl.

105
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:27,905
Then can I know her?

106
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:30,992
Jayne! Don't sully this.

107
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:34,704
You are gonna be cleaning latrines with
your face if you don't cut that out.

108
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:37,123
Who's the new recruit?

109
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:42,086
Everybody,
I want you all to meet...

110
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,714
Mrs. Reynolds.

111
00:07:44,922 --> 00:07:48,050
(gasps)
You got married?

112
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,805
Wow, that's, uh--
Congratulations.

113
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:55,683
We'd always hoped you two kids
would get together.

114
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,101
Who is she?
She's no one.

115
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,395
(sobs quietly)
Captain!

116
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:02,106
Would you stop that?
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:02,523 --> 00:08:03,649
You brute.

118
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:06,486
Oh, sweetie,
don't feel bad.

119
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,614
He makes everybody cry.
He's like a monster.

120
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:13,117
I'm not a monster!
Wash, turn the ship around.

121
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,577
Can't.
It's an order.

122
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,537
Yah, but we can't.
What the hell is wrong with--

123
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,581
Have you got an encyclopedia?

124
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,750
(speaks Chinese)

125
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,545
There's already a bulletin on the cortex
as to the murder of a prefect's nephew.

126
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:27,006
That's right. One of our bandits
has family ties.

127
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,674
So unless you feel like walking into a
gallows,

128
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,468
I suggest we continue on to Beaumond,

129
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:33,346
and you, enjoy your honeymoon.

130
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:39,143
This isn't happening.
Would you stop crying!

131
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:42,146
For God's sake, Mal, could you be a human
being for 30 seconds?

132
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:45,525
As one married man to another--
I'm not married!

133
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:49,237
(whimpering)
I'm sorry.

134
00:08:49,946 --> 00:08:53,991
You--You have very nice qualities,
but I didn't ever marry you.

135
00:08:54,283 --> 00:08:56,077
I believe you did...

136
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,371
last night.

137
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,753
How drunk was I last night?
I don't know. I passed out.

138
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,129
BOOK:
It says here,

139
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:09,882
"The woman lays the wreath
upon her intended--"

140
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,093
which I do recall.

141
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,971
"Which represents his sovereignty.
That was you?

142
00:09:16,222 --> 00:09:19,183
"And he drinks of her wine.
(stifled laughing)

143
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,728
And then there's a dance
with a joining of hands."

144
00:09:23,729 --> 00:09:26,315
The marriage ceremony
of the Triumph settlers.

145
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:30,653
You, sir... are a newlywed.

146
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:36,325
What's it say in there
about divorce?

147
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:44,667
(speaking Chinese)

148
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,169
(speaks Chinese)

149
00:09:48,796 --> 00:09:50,965
I really think you're
the one to talk to her, sir.

150
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,676
The way I see it, me and her got one thing
in common.

151
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,678
We're the only ones who don't think
this is funny.

152
00:09:59,807 --> 00:10:01,517
Hello!

153
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,477
Woman... person.

154
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:13,237
You all right?

155
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:18,993
I thought last night during the ceremony
that you were pleased.

156
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,538
Well, yeah,
last night I was.

157
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:28,169
Had some mulled wine, pretty girl gave me
a hat made out of a tree.

158
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:31,088
Nobody said I was signing up
to have and to hold.

159
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:33,674
Are you gonna kill me?

160
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:37,720
What? What kind of crappy planet is that?
Kill you.

161
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,765
In the maiden's home, I heard talk of men
who weren't pleased with their brides--

162
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:44,685
Well, I ain't them. And don't you ever
stand for that sort of thing.

163
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:48,689
Someone ever tries to kill you,
you try to kill them right back.

164
00:10:50,733 --> 00:10:52,777
Look, wife or no,

165
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:56,822
you are no one's property
to be tossed aside.

166
00:10:57,198 --> 00:11:01,744
You got the right, same as anyone,
to live and try to kill people.

167
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:05,039
I mean, you know,
people that are--

168
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:07,583
That--That's
a dumb planet.

169
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:11,170
What will you do with me?

170
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,881
I'm not really sure.

171
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:18,010
We're bound for Beaumond.
It's a decent kind of planet.

172
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:21,347
Might be able to set you up
with some sort of work there.

173
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:23,015
I'll not be anyone's doxy.

174
00:11:23,099 --> 00:11:25,142
I don't mean whoring.
They got factories and the like.

175
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:28,437
Some ranches, if you're more
for the outdoors.

176
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:31,774
Near a week before we get there.
I'll figure something.

177
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:35,736
I'd be a good wife.
(sighs)

178
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,115
Yeah, well,
I'd be a terrible husband.

179
00:11:39,907 --> 00:11:41,617
You have five whole days
to figure that out.

180
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:45,287
For five days we'll be together?

181
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:48,457
Well, we'll be together
on the ship, but not in any--

182
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:52,336
That'll be fine. I'll do for you... or
not, as you choose.

183
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,296
Well, shiny.

184
00:11:56,924 --> 00:11:59,468
Hungry? Kitchen's
just through there.

185
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,264
I'll cook you something.

186
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,473
Well, no. I meant for you.

187
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:06,684
I'm a fine cook.
Everyone says.

188
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:10,020
That's--It's great.
Look, hold it. Hold.

189
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:12,898
I ain't never even
My name is Saffron.

190
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:29,790
Divorce is very rare and requires
dispensation from her pastor.

191
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,419
I can send him a wave,
see what I can do.

192
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,172
I appreciate that.
She's a nice girl.

193
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,883
Seems very anxious to please you.
It's their way, I guess.

194
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:40,801
I suppose so.

195
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:44,472
If you take sexual advantage of her,

196
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:47,767
you're going to burn in a very special
level of hell,

197
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:50,352
a level they reserve
for child molesters...

198
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,855
and people who talk
at the theater.

199
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:56,484
Wh--I am not--

200
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,196
Preacher,
you got a smutty mind.

201
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,698
Perhaps I spoke out of turn.
Per-maybe-haps, I'm thinkin'.

202
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:06,118
I apologize. I'll make her up a room
in the passenger dorm.

203
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,828
Good.

204
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,248
The special hell.

205
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,298
Thank you.

206
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:21,217
Looks--

207
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,720
WASH:
Something smells good.

208
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,224
Having yourself
a little supper, Captain?

209
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:32,019
Saffron insisted on it. You know, I
didn't want to make her feel--

210
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:33,979
(chuckling)
This is damn tasty.

211
00:13:33,979 --> 00:13:36,649
Is there any more
where that came from?

212
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,944
I didn't think to make enough
for your friends,

213
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:43,823
but everything's laid out if you'd like
to cook for your husband.

214
00:13:44,114 --> 00:13:46,700
Yeah.
Isn't she quaint?

215
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:48,953
I'm just not hungry.

216
00:13:49,078 --> 00:13:53,624
So... are you enjoying your own nubile
little slave girl?

217
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,836
She wanted to make me dinner.
At least she's not crying.

218
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:59,588
I might. Did she really make
fresh bao?

219
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:01,757
Quaint!

220
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,260
Remember that sex we were
planning to have ever again?

221
00:14:04,343 --> 00:14:06,095
You're all making a big deal.

222
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:09,974
I would appreciate it if one person on
this boat would not assume...

223
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,059
that I'm an evil, lecherous hump.

224
00:14:12,142 --> 00:14:13,769
Nobody's saying that, sir.

225
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:17,106
Yeah, we're pretty much just giving
each other significant glances

226
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:18,774
and laughing incessantly.

227
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,901
Is that cider?
By the stove.

228
00:14:20,985 --> 00:14:24,113
Yum. I'll get you a refill.
Honey?

229
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:27,032
That's for me to do.

230
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:34,748
You know, uh, you weren't lyin'
about your cookin'.

231
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:37,501
If I hadn't already eaten--

232
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:42,548
You don't want to finish?
No, I just, um

233
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:45,843
I have captainy things to do, but
truthfully, that's a fine meal.

234
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,720
Thank you.
Do you need anything else?

235
00:14:47,803 --> 00:14:49,096
No. No.

236
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:53,642
Um, you just have something
to eat yourself, and, uh,

237
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:56,395
and I'm gonna go... captain.

238
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:59,023
If you're done with supper,

239
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:02,860
would you like me
to wash your feet?

240
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,541
Beaumond.

241
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:22,046
City of New Dunsmuir.
(beeping)

242
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:24,381
Arrival: October 24.

243
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,759
Departure--
Can I come in?

244
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,887
No.
See? That's why I usually don't ask.

245
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:31,889
What do you want?

246
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:35,601
Oh, I just needed to...
hide.

247
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:39,188
So I take it the honeymoon is over?
Oh, she's a fine girl.

248
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:41,357
Don't misread me.
A hell of a cook too.

249
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,734
I'm sure she has
many exciting talents.

250
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,446
Do you ever...

251
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,407
wash your clients' feet?

252
00:15:50,491 --> 00:15:52,159
It's my specialty.

253
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,579
We'll be on Beaumond
at least two weeks, right?

254
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,164
Can't exactly be sure.

255
00:15:57,247 --> 00:16:00,751
No. I need you to be exactly sure. I can't
make commitments and then not keep them.

256
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,503
That's your specialty.

257
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:06,048
I'm Sorry. Are you touchy because I got
myself a bride

258
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,133
or 'cause I don't plan to keep her?

259
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,010
I find the whole thing degrading.

260
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,681
That's just what Saffron said
about your line of work.

261
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:18,060
Maybe you should think twice about letting
go of Saffron. You two sound like a match.

262
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,521
Maybe you're right.
Maybe we're soul mates.

263
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:23,607
Yes. Great. I wish you
hundreds of fat children.

264
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:27,861
Could you imagine that? Me with a whole
passel of critters underfoot.

265
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:28,946
Hell, in ten years' time I could--

266
00:16:29,029 --> 00:16:31,782
Can you leave me alone for five minutes,
please?

267
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,546
I wasn't lookin' for a fight.

268
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:55,347
Always do seem to find one, though.

269
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:01,645
Do I have your attention?

270
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:05,315
Kind of going to extremes here,
ain't we?

271
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:09,528
There's times I think you don't take
me seriously. I think that oughta change.

272
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:12,322
Do you think
it's likely to?

273
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:13,991
You got something you don't deserve.

274
00:17:14,074 --> 00:17:17,828
And it's brought me a galaxy of fun,
I'm here to tell ya.

275
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:21,832
Six men came to kill me one time,

276
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,294
and the best of them carried this.

277
00:17:25,878 --> 00:17:28,380
It's a Callahan full-bore auto lock.

278
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:31,800
Customized trigger.
Double cartridge thorough gauge.

279
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:38,891
It is my very favorite gun.

280
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:44,313
(speaking Chinese)
Are you offering me a trade?

281
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,648
A trade? Hell, it's theft.

282
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,736
This is the best damn gun made by man.
It has extreme sentimental value.

283
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:53,655
It's miles more worthy than what you got.
What I got?

284
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,450
She has a name.
So does this.

285
00:17:57,367 --> 00:17:58,952
I call it Vera.

286
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:03,207
Well my days of not taking you seriously
are certainly comin' to a middle.

287
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:06,502
Damn it, Mal. I'd treat her okay.
She's not to be bought.

288
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:10,172
Nor bartered, or borrowed, or lent.

289
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:13,383
She's a human woman, doesn't know a thing
about the world and needs our protection.

290
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,677
Well, I'll protect her.
Jayne.

291
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,723
Go play with your rain stick.

292
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:29,358
(gasps)

293
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:31,401
(sighs)

294
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:32,861
You do sneak about, don't you?

295
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:35,656
You're a good man.

296
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,784
You clearly haven't been talkin' to anyone
else on this boat.

297
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,286
I don't wish to be wed to the large one.

298
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,498
I'd rather--If I'm not to be yours,

299
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:47,751
I'd rather have the work
you spoke of.

300
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,838
I could be useful on a ranch.

301
00:18:51,797 --> 00:18:53,590
It's good work.

302
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:58,178
My mama had a ranch back on Shadow,
where I'm from.

303
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,098
Ran cattle, mostly.

304
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:03,767
Wasn't nobody ran 'em
harder or smarter.

305
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:07,396
She used to tell me, "Don't brand the
cattle. Brand the buyer.

306
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:09,648
He's the one likely to stray."

307
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:13,569
She raised you herself?
Well, her and about 40 hands.

308
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,488
I had more family for a kid--

309
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,076
That is odd.
What?

310
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,037
I just don't--

311
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,375
I'm not one who talks about what's past,
and here you got me--

312
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:31,795
Does your crew never show interest
in your life?

313
00:19:32,254 --> 00:19:34,840
No. They... are--

314
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,594
They just know me well enough to--

315
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:44,141
Well, what about you?
What's your history?

316
00:19:46,643 --> 00:19:48,520
Not much to say.

317
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,482
Life like yours, I figure you'd find mine
terrible dull.

318
00:19:52,482 --> 00:19:54,568
Oh, I long for a little dullness.

319
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,486
Truth to say,

320
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:59,740
this whole trip's gettin' to be just
a little too interesting.

321
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,287
MAN: It's a wreck.
(beeping)

322
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,331
MAN #2: No, this is good.
It's parts.

323
00:20:07,414 --> 00:20:10,083
A lot of cheap parts
we'll never unload.

324
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:12,920
This is why you'll never
be in charge, Bree.

325
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:16,298
You don't see the whole. The parts are
crap. I said exactly that.

326
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,468
But you put it together, you got a
Firefly.

327
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:22,596
Thing'll run forever, they got a mechanic
even half awake.

328
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:24,723
It's got no flash.

329
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,643
Some people ain't lookin' for flash.

330
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:29,811
She's a good catch.

331
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:32,314
She comes our way,
you prep the nets.

332
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,822
Clearly,
she's out of her mind.

333
00:20:40,948 --> 00:20:43,825
Really?
She's led a sheltered life.

334
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:46,787
Did you see the way she grabbed that glass
from you?

335
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,748
Every planet has its own weird customs.

336
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:52,334
About a year before we met,
I spent six weeks on a moon...

337
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:55,879
where the principle form of recreation
was juggling geese.

338
00:20:56,171 --> 00:21:00,133
My hand to God. Baby geese. Goslings.
They were juggled.

339
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,846
Of course. The man rushes in
to defend her.

340
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,140
I'm talking about geese.

341
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,227
Captain shouldn't be baby-sitting a damn
groupie, and he knows it.

342
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:12,354
Okay, when did this
become not funny?

343
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:15,315
When you didn't put her ass
back down on Triumph for it belongs.

344
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:18,694
Oh, hey! Now it's even my fault?

345
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,487
Is there anything else on your mind
I should know about?

346
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,031
There's all sorts of twists and
cul de sacs. It's wild.

347
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:23,949
She's trouble.

348
00:21:24,032 --> 00:21:25,659
I'm getting that.

349
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:29,621
I'm going to bed.

350
00:21:48,348 --> 00:21:49,850
Hey!

351
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,893
Well, you're, uh,

352
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:55,605
uh, well...
there you are.

353
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,191
I've made the bed
warm for you.

354
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:01,320
It--It looks, uh...
warm.

355
00:22:02,529 --> 00:22:04,740
And I've made myself
ready for you.

356
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:10,120
Let's ride right past the part where you
explain exactly what that means.

357
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,331
Didn't you see you got a room
of your own?

358
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,416
And I'm to sleep there?

359
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:16,460
That's the notion,

360
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:20,088
assuming you're--
yeah--sleepy.

361
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,842
But we've been wed. Aren't we to become
one flesh?

362
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,720
Well, no. Uh, we're still
two fleshes here,

363
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:31,683
and I think that your flesh oughta
sleep somewhere else.

364
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:34,227
I'm sorry.
When we talked, I'd hoped--

365
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,188
Whoa, hey. Flesh.

366
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,274
Um... Saffron,

367
00:22:39,274 --> 00:22:41,818
i-it--it ain't a question
of pleasing me.

368
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:45,364
It's more a question
of what's--

369
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:48,867
um, of what's
morally right.

370
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:52,371
I do know my Bible, sir.

371
00:22:53,121 --> 00:22:55,207
"On the night
of their betrothal,

372
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:59,252
"the wife shall open to the man
as the furrow to the plow,

373
00:22:59,252 --> 00:23:01,755
"and he shall work in her...

374
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:04,341
"in and again...

375
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,676
"till she bring him
to his full,

376
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:09,513
and rest him then
upon the sweat of her breast."

377
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:14,810
Oh. Good Bible.

378
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:19,356
I'm not skilled, sir,
nor a pleasure to look upon.

379
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,650
Saffron.

380
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:24,694
You're pleasing.
You're, uh--

381
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:28,281
Hell, you're
all kinds of pleasin',

382
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:32,744
and, uh, it's-- it's been a while--
a long damn while--

383
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,205
since anybody but me
took ahold of my plow,

384
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,833
so don't think for a second
that I ain't interested.

385
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:41,294
But you and me,
we ain't married.

386
00:23:42,462 --> 00:23:43,880
Just 'cause you got handed to me by some

387
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,382
(Chinese) who couldn't pay off his
debts...

388
00:23:45,382 --> 00:23:48,510
don't make you
beholden to me.

389
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:50,512
I keep trying to explain.
Let me explain.

390
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,891
I lived my life
in the maiden house,

391
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:58,395
waiting to be married off
for trade.

392
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:02,524
I seen my sisteren paired off
with ugly men,

393
00:24:02,983 --> 00:24:05,402
vicious or blubberous,

394
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,737
men with appetites...

395
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:10,115
too unseemly to speak on.

396
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:14,119
And I've cried for those girls.

397
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,749
But not half so hard as I cried the night
they gave me to you.

398
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:23,670
Why?

399
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,214
Is there blubber?

400
00:24:27,716 --> 00:24:30,635
I cried
for I'd not dreamed...

401
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:32,220
to have a man so sweet,

402
00:24:33,930 --> 00:24:36,266
so kind and beautiful.

403
00:24:37,267 --> 00:24:39,603
Had I the dare to choose,
I'd choose you...

404
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:43,023
from all the men on all the planets
the night sky could show me.

405
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:47,444
If I'm wed,

406
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:50,238
I am a woman,

407
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:52,741
and I'll take your leave
to be bold.

408
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,413
I want this.

409
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:01,833
I swell to think of you in me.

410
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,629
And I see that you do too.

411
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:08,757
Oh, th-that's just, uh--

412
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:12,427
Leave me at the nearest port.
Never look upon me again.

413
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,805
I'll make my way with the strength
that you've taught me.

414
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,476
Only let me have
my wedding night.

415
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:25,232
Oh, I'm gonna go
to the special hell.

416
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:31,321
I've--

417
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:35,116
I really wish it was
that simple, girl, but--

418
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:47,671
Son of a--

419
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,297
(hits floor)

420
00:25:51,508 --> 00:25:53,134
Night, sweetie.

421
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:01,351
(machinery beeping)

422
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,439
Well, if it isn't
the master chef.

423
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:09,734
Not sleepy?

424
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:14,322
Am I allowed to be up here?
Well, sure. Why not?

425
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:17,033
It's not like anyone else
is taking up space.

426
00:26:19,202 --> 00:26:21,705
I've never been
off-world before.

427
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:25,750
It's beautiful, isn't it?
It's like a dream.

428
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:29,546
Planet I'm from, couldn't see one of 'em,
pollution so thick.

429
00:26:29,629 --> 00:26:31,339
Sometimes I think
I entered flight school...

430
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,593
just to see what the hell
everyone was talking about.

431
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:37,721
(door closing)
What are you doing?

432
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,600
Now we're alone,
just us and the stars.

433
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,394
No ship,
no bellowing engines,

434
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:46,146
no crew to bicker
at each other.

435
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:48,732
Look.

436
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:51,276
Come look.

437
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,408
Do you know the myth
of Earth-that-was?

438
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,869
Not so much.

439
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:04,789
That when she was born,
she had no sky...

440
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:07,751
and was open,
inviting.

441
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:11,463
And the stars
would rush into her...

442
00:27:11,921 --> 00:27:14,466
through the skin of her--
Yeah.

443
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:17,594
making the oceans
boil with sensation.

444
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:23,475
And when she could endure
no more ecstasy,

445
00:27:23,683 --> 00:27:27,354
she puffed up her cheeks
and blew out the sky.

446
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,401
Whoa. Good myth.

447
00:27:36,571 --> 00:27:38,865
My whole life,
I saw nothing...

448
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:42,619
but roofs and steeples
and the cellar door.

449
00:27:44,287 --> 00:27:47,457
In a few days, I'll be back to that life
and gone from yours.

450
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,961
Make this night
what it should be.

451
00:27:53,338 --> 00:27:55,423
Please?

452
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,509
Show me the stars.

453
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,137
(speaking Chinese)

454
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:03,682
I wish I was
somebody else right now.

455
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:08,937
Somebody not married, not madly in love
with a beautiful woman...

456
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,314
who can kill me with her pinky.

457
00:28:11,564 --> 00:28:14,234
I've been too forward.
No! Well, yes. But

458
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:15,610
I actually
like that in a woman.

459
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:20,323
That's part of why Zoe and I are, as
previously mentioned, married.

460
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,617
I thought--

461
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:26,788
She didn't seem
to respect you.

462
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:29,833
Not everybody gets me and Zoe
at first glance.

463
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:33,294
Did it get very hot in here?
I need airflow.

464
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:35,463
You love her very much.

465
00:28:37,006 --> 00:28:38,133
Yeah.

466
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:41,845
I never did meet
anyone quite like Zoe.

467
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:45,223
The, uh, the first time
we met, she actually--

468
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,871
(gasps)
Are you lost?

469
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:52,332
I'm sorry. I thought the other
shuttle was yours.

470
00:29:52,332 --> 00:29:56,127
It is. I was on the cortex and my screen
shorted. This one's out too.

471
00:29:58,838 --> 00:30:02,300
Looking for customers?
What were you looking for?

472
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:06,346
I don't mean to be rude. A Companion's
life is so glamorous and strange.

473
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,140
I wish I had the skill
for such a trade.

474
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,477
You'd like to please
your new husband?

475
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:16,564
He'll have none of me.
For true, I'm somewhat relieved.

476
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:21,986
If I'm to learn of love,

477
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,989
I'd like it to be at the hands
of someone gentle.

478
00:30:26,533 --> 00:30:30,703
Someone who could...
feel what I feel.

479
00:30:32,747 --> 00:30:37,043
But Mal said you--
you don't approve of my work.

480
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:40,421
Sure, and he said that
to keep you from me.

481
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,883
I was too curious
about you...

482
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:47,053
ever since I saw you.

483
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:55,103
Come to my shuttle.

484
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:59,399
You would--

485
00:30:59,774 --> 00:31:01,359
you would lie with me?

486
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:03,403
(alarm sounding)

487
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:05,905
I guess we've lied enough.

488
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:08,199
You're good. You're amazing.
Who are you?

489
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,493
Malcolm Reynolds's widow.

490
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:39,439
ZOE: Baby? Wake up.

491
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:41,608
He's bleeding.
JAYNE: There's no one in there.

492
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:43,776
What's going on?

493
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:53,244
Mal! Mal, Mal, Mal, Mal, Mal!
(groans)

494
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:55,872
(sighs, speaks Chinese)

495
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,881
(dings)
Get the doctor.

496
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:07,216
Mal's hurt. He--

497
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:10,011
Oh.

498
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:16,351
Oh, you stupid
son of a--

499
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,321
Is it Christmas?

500
00:32:28,655 --> 00:32:30,031
Well, he's back.

501
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,241
What happened about me?

502
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:36,120
Your blushing bride was a plant.
She took both of you out.

503
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:41,042
How did--
Narcotic compound.

504
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:43,795
Probably spread over
a seal on her lips.

505
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,214
You get it on yours,
and pow.

506
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:49,050
Lips, huh?
Well--

507
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:52,971
We used to get a lot of guys brought in on
the night shift at the E.R.,

508
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,722
usually robbed, very groggy.

509
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:58,142
They called it the good-night kiss.
So you two were kissin'?

510
00:32:58,518 --> 00:33:01,062
Well, isn't that... special.

511
00:33:01,896 --> 00:33:04,899
Wash, how did
Hey, I just got kicked in the head.

512
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:07,110
My man would never fall
for that (Chinese).

513
00:33:07,193 --> 00:33:10,238
Most of my head wishes I had.
You guys don't understand.

514
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:13,449
Seems pretty simple from here.
You were taking advantage of her--

515
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:17,578
I was the one being taken advantage of!
My apologies.

516
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:19,622
You were victimized,
Wash was beaten...

517
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:21,457
and Inara found you here.

518
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:25,336
Yeah, then I fell.
My head got hurt, like Wash.

519
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:27,839
I don't get any of this.
I only fell, is all.

520
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,341
What the hell's our status?
We're shut down.

521
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:32,176
Jayne and Kaylee are trying
to get us on the bridge.

522
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:35,930
All we know is we're headed somewhere,
and it ain't Beaumond.

523
00:33:40,393 --> 00:33:43,479
Oh, I'm fine.
I don't need to be examined.

524
00:33:43,730 --> 00:33:45,732
I'm comfy.

525
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:54,866
She didn't just lock it. She fused it to
something. Both entrances.

526
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:58,870
What was she after?
Besides molesting innocent captains?

527
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:01,456
You want to stow it, Preacher?
We're in some peril here.

528
00:34:01,539 --> 00:34:03,416
If she can fly this thing, why just take
the shuttle?

529
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,376
Maybe she likes shuttles.

530
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:08,963
Some people juggle geese.

531
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:16,929
She's a pro.
This is a masterful job of muck up.

532
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:18,765
See how she crossed the drive feeds?
Yeah-huh.

533
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:22,435
So we even try to reroute, it'll lock
down. (speaks Chinese)

534
00:34:22,518 --> 00:34:25,980
She went straight for the thermal cap.
Yeah, yeah!

535
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,190
WASH: We are so hung.

536
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,192
I'm glad you two are having
a good time under there.

537
00:34:29,275 --> 00:34:30,651
Can we progress to the making it right?

538
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:32,570
That's not gonna happen
for a long while, Captain.

539
00:34:32,653 --> 00:34:34,530
We don't have a long while.

540
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,033
We could be headed straight into a nice,
big, solid moon, for all we know,

541
00:34:37,158 --> 00:34:40,119
so how's about we get to work?

542
00:34:40,286 --> 00:34:44,582
Hey! It was your big make-out session
that got us into this, sir.

543
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:47,794
I was poisoned.
You were drugged.

544
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,254
That's why I never
kiss 'em on the mouth.

545
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,176
Well, what can you do?

546
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:57,887
Give us time, we can get the cortex and
navcon back on-line,

547
00:34:57,970 --> 00:34:59,764
at least see where we're headed.

548
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,432
What about steering?
What about stopping?

549
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:04,060
She humped us hard.
We're gonna have to do a lot--

550
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,897
Do it. Doesn't help me to see where I'm
goin' if I can't change course.

551
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:10,608
This girl really knows
her ships.

552
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:13,319
That's not all she knows.
She's well-schooled.

553
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:16,948
What do you mean the sedative?
The good-night kiss?

554
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,992
I only hit my head,
but Mal went through that.

555
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:25,832
But no--I mean, seduction,
body language, signals.

556
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:29,085
She's had training,
as in Companion,

557
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:31,295
as in academy.

558
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,923
Our little Saffron's quite a wonder.

559
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,843
I'm beginning to think
she married beneath herself.

560
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:37,885
(mock laugh)

561
00:35:38,052 --> 00:35:39,929
How do you know?
About the training.

562
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,849
She tried
to seduce me too.

563
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:44,809
Really?

564
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:51,190
Did she--
Did you--

565
00:35:51,774 --> 00:35:53,109
You don't play a player.

566
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:55,820
It was sloppy of her to try it, but I
think she was in a rush.

567
00:35:56,779 --> 00:35:57,864
But she had professional--

568
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:01,659
So in my case, I mean,
it was really--

569
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:05,037
(scoffs)
You would have kissed her too.

570
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:09,917
Wash didn't.
But she was naked and all... articulate.

571
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:13,963
Okay! Everybody not talking
about sex, in here.

572
00:36:14,046 --> 00:36:15,423
Everybody else, elsewhere.

573
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:18,259
(beeping)
They're coming!

574
00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:20,928
How far out? Ten minutes or so.
Right on target.

575
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:23,931
Speed: A-1.

576
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,893
Huh. That girl's a wonder.
She gets it done.

577
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,769
I'll tell the boys.

578
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:35,193
Yes!

579
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,236
You got it?

580
00:36:37,862 --> 00:36:39,864
We got life,
we got screens.

581
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:41,699
It's a qualified yes,
a partial.

582
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,618
What about nav control?
No.

583
00:36:44,493 --> 00:36:45,369
So where are we headed?

584
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:48,289
The coordinates she entered, we're headed
for something, and it's not too far.

585
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:51,375
Did she signal anybody?
(speaking Chinese)

586
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:54,378
She did.
Same coordinates, no I.D.

587
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:57,423
Huh. Who's out there?

588
00:36:57,715 --> 00:37:00,676
Let me see if her signal wave can
translate to a visual. There might be--

589
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:03,429
Hey, uh--

590
00:37:03,888 --> 00:37:05,765
Electromagnetic interference.

591
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:08,726
It's bouncing the signal all over
the place. Look at it.

592
00:37:09,810 --> 00:37:11,896
It's like a circle.

593
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,817
It's a net.

594
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:20,821
I don't get it.
Where are we headed?

595
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:22,698
The end of the line.

596
00:37:36,462 --> 00:37:38,130
It's a carrion house.

597
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,757
Scrap shop.

598
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:42,760
Takes ships, pulls them apart
or fixes them up.

599
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:46,055
Doesn't sound that scary.
That pattern you're looking at is a net.

600
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,224
We fall into that,
we're more than helpless.

601
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:50,726
It'll turn the ship into one big
electrical conduit,

602
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,561
burn us all from the inside out.

603
00:37:52,561 --> 00:37:54,772
Some of the newer ones
will just hold you,

604
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:57,942
and then the scrappers
will override the air locks,

605
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:01,153
pull the O2 or just gas you.

606
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:03,531
They're not looking
to deal with survivors.

607
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:07,201
One day you're gonna tell us all how
a preacher knows so much about crime.

608
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:09,996
Kaylee?
I'm trying, sir.

609
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:12,498
Keep on it.
We can't fall into that net.

610
00:38:13,249 --> 00:38:15,126
We're gonna need
a Plan "B."

611
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:21,632
Zoe, get our suits
prepped now.

612
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,384
I figure we got
one shot at this.

613
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:26,012
Give me a visual as soon as we're close.
It won't be long.

614
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:29,015
What do I do?

615
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,850
You go get Vera.

616
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:35,521
She needs oxygen around her to fire,
and we don't have a case.

617
00:38:35,604 --> 00:38:37,982
We're gonna use a suit.
Here, we got it.

618
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,484
What am I aimin' for,
the window?

619
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:42,737
That might kill some folk,
but it won't disrupt the net.

620
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,531
See these six points where it's brightest?
Those are the breakers.

621
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:47,783
Hit one of those,
should short it out.

622
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:49,660
What do you mean,
"should"?

623
00:39:11,557 --> 00:39:12,391
MAL:
You see it?

624
00:39:12,475 --> 00:39:16,562
Clear as day.
See, Vera?

625
00:39:16,645 --> 00:39:20,483
Dress yourself up, you get taken out
somewhere fun.

626
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,641
(beeping)
We got it.

627
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,810
It's not pretty,

628
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,187
but we can steer enough
to turn the hell around.

629
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:01,399
Nice work, Kaylee.
Not soon enough to help.

630
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:04,485
Hey, it's a lot easier to pull things
apart than it is to put 'em right.

631
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,821
You're still
the best mechanic floatin'.

632
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:08,823
Captain, don't you know
kissing girls makes you sleepy?

633
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,075
Sometimes I can't help myself.

634
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:14,578
Now, let's go visiting.

635
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:27,883
Honey, I'm home.

636
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:37,518
Looks like you get that wedding night
after all.

637
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:45,067
(panting)
It's the first time, darlin'.

638
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:48,696
I think you should be gentle with me.
You gonna kill me?

639
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:51,490
Can you conjure up a terribly compelling
reason for me not to?

640
00:40:52,116 --> 00:40:53,576
I didn't kill you.

641
00:40:53,659 --> 00:40:56,954
You handed me and my crew over to those
that would kill us. That buys you nothing.

642
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:58,998
I made you dinner.

643
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:03,836
Why the act? All the seduction games,
the dancing about folk.

644
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,754
There has to be
an easier way to steal.

645
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:08,424
You're assuming
the payoff is the point.

646
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:10,509
I'm not assuming anything at this
juncture.

647
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:12,261
How'd you find me?

648
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:15,890
Only a few places that shuttle would
make it to from where you left.

649
00:41:16,515 --> 00:41:18,225
Happy to find it intact.

650
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,979
You're quite a man,
Malcolm Reynolds.

651
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:26,317
I've been waiting a long time for someone
good enough to take me down.

652
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:28,777
Saffron,

653
00:41:29,778 --> 00:41:31,405
you even think about
playing me again,

654
00:41:31,447 --> 00:41:33,240
I will riddle you
with holes.

655
00:41:34,158 --> 00:41:36,160
Everybody plays each other.

656
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:39,705
That's all anybody ever does.
We play parts.

657
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:42,833
You got all kinds of learnin', and you
made me look the fool without tryin',

658
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:46,295
and yet here I am
with a gun to your head.

659
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:50,716
That's 'cause I got people with me,
people who trust each other,

660
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:54,094
who do for each other and ain't always
lookin' for the advantage.

661
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:56,847
Promise me you're
gonna kill me soon.

662
00:41:57,014 --> 00:41:59,058
Oh, you already know
I ain't gonna.

663
00:42:00,893 --> 00:42:02,853
You know,
you did pretty well.

664
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:06,148
Most men, they're on me
inside of ten minutes,

665
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:09,902
not tryin' to teach me
to be strong and the like.

666
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:13,197
I got one question for ya,

667
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:16,116
just one thing I'd like to know
straight up.

668
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:18,827
Ask me.

669
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:20,913
What's your real name?

670
00:42:28,587 --> 00:42:31,757
(sighs)
You'd only have lied anyhow.

671
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:36,470
(knocking)
Come in.

672
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:38,514
Back on course.

673
00:42:39,306 --> 00:42:42,226
Be on Beaumond a day or two late.
Hope it's all right.

674
00:42:42,518 --> 00:42:44,186
It should be fine,
thank you.

675
00:42:45,145 --> 00:42:46,939
And does the vixen live?

676
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:50,109
Yeah, if you can
call it that.

677
00:42:50,693 --> 00:42:52,111
All's well, I suppose.

678
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:53,737
Yes.

679
00:42:57,157 --> 00:42:59,577
You're a very graceful
woman, Inara.

680
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:01,078
I--

681
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:03,956
Thank you.

682
00:43:05,749 --> 00:43:07,126
So here's where I'm fuzzy.

683
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:11,088
You got by that girl,
came and found me,

684
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:14,425
and somehow you happened to
just trip and fall.

685
00:43:14,717 --> 00:43:17,094
What do you mean?
Come on, Inara.

686
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:19,763
How's about
we don't play?

687
00:43:20,806 --> 00:43:22,933
You didn't just trip,
did you?

688
00:43:27,021 --> 00:43:28,355
No.

689
00:43:29,148 --> 00:43:30,983
Well, isn't that something?

690
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:34,987
I knew you let her kiss you.

691
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,494
(whistling)

692
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,040
(door opens, closes)

693
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,123
Grr! Arrgh!
