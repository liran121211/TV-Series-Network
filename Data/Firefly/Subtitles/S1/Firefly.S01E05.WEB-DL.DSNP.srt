1
00:00:01,501 --> 00:00:04,004
MAL:Here's how it is.
The Earth got used up.

2
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:07,966
So, we moved out and terraformed a whole
new galaxy of Earths.

3
00:00:08,091 --> 00:00:10,719
Some, rich and flush
with the new technologies,

4
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:12,887
some, not so much.

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,641
The Central Planets,
thems formed the Alliance,

6
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:19,728
waged war to bring everyone
under their rule.

7
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:23,064
A few idiots tried to fight it.
Among 'em, myself.

8
00:00:23,148 --> 00:00:25,316
I'm Malcolm Reynolds,
captain of Serenity.

9
00:00:25,608 --> 00:00:27,944
She's a transport ship,
Firefly class.

10
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:32,073
Got a good crew--
Fighters, pilot, mechanic.

11
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:34,117
We even picked up a preacher
for some reason...

12
00:00:34,242 --> 00:00:36,202
and a bona fide companion.

13
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:39,914
There's a doctor too, took his genius
sister out of some Alliance camp.

14
00:00:39,914 --> 00:00:43,084
So, they're keepin' a low profile.
You understand.

15
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:45,336
You got a job, we can do it.

16
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:47,839
Don't much care
what it is.

17
00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,094
BOOK: Previously--

18
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,346
You're a shepherd.
Thought the outfit gave it away.

19
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,808
One day, you're gonna tell us all how a
preacher knows so damn much about crime.

20
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:00,935
SIMON:
My sister's a genius.

21
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:04,481
There was a government-sponsored academy.
We had never even heard of it.

22
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,274
But it had the most exciting program.

23
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,026
For two years,
I couldn't get near her.

24
00:01:08,276 --> 00:01:10,028
Finally I got a letter
that made no sense.

25
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:13,490
It was a code. It just said,
"They're hurting us."

26
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,575
I still don't know what the government was
trying to do with her,

27
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,494
so I have no idea
if they succeeded.

28
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,662
BOOK:
That young man's very brave.

29
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,082
Gave up everything to free his sister
from that place.

30
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:25,835
Two by two, hands of blue.

31
00:01:26,169 --> 00:01:29,839
We're looking for a girl.
This girl.

32
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,383
Badger.
Captain Reynolds.

33
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:35,386
There's a local. Got some property he
wants to sell off-planet.

34
00:01:35,887 --> 00:01:38,431
What my man Harrow needs
himself is a smuggler.

35
00:01:38,515 --> 00:01:41,309
If you're willing to fight that hard
to protect my property,

36
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:43,561
I'll have it in your hold
before midnight.

37
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,063
It's good to have cargo.

38
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:47,148
(mooing)

39
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:09,462
We're in trouble.

40
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,926
We got cut off.

41
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:17,929
Cut off from what?
Our platoon, Simon.

42
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:20,098
We got outflanked
by the independent squad,

43
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,892
and we're never gonna make it
back to our platoon.

44
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,521
We need to resort
to cannibalism.

45
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:29,899
That was fast. Don't we
have rations or anything?

46
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,735
They got lost.
We're gonna have to eat the men.

47
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:35,905
Aren't you supposed to be practicing
for your dance recital?

48
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,533
I learned it all.
That's wrong.

49
00:02:39,117 --> 00:02:40,577
It's from the book, River.

50
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,414
No. The book is wrong. This whole
conclusion is fallacious.

51
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,209
(sighing)

52
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,796
So, how'd the independents
cut us off?

53
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,716
They were using dinosaurs.
(speaking Chinese)

54
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,593
Language, young man.

55
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:00,263
Sorry, Dad. The independents
attacked us with dinosaurs.

56
00:03:00,388 --> 00:03:02,390
Simon lost his head
in the heat of battle.

57
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:06,144
(chuckles, speaks Chinese)

58
00:03:06,144 --> 00:03:09,439
Because there were dinosaurs
involved, I think we'll let it slide.

59
00:03:09,522 --> 00:03:13,109
Did you get my wave?
I got it. Your text shorted.

60
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:16,237
I got the whole thing during a board
meeting. Thank you.

61
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,823
If I had a dedicated source box,
it wouldn't short out.

62
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:20,200
I lost half my essay.

63
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:23,286
Yes, and you'd have access to any
(Chinese)

64
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,412
that filtered in from the cortex.

65
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,915
I absolutely forbid it.
Dad!

66
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:30,210
Dad!
I will not have it in my house.

67
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,629
But since your mother's
already ordered you one,

68
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,465
I guess I should give up the fantasy
that this is my house.

69
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,841
Are you kidding?

70
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:40,386
You will repay me by becoming a
brilliant doctor.

71
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:41,888
That's the deal.

72
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:45,099
Dedicated source box--
brilliant doctor.

73
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,060
When do I
Many years.

74
00:03:47,143 --> 00:03:49,896
Dad, this is so (speaking Chinese).
It's really gonna--

75
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:54,025
I know. You think I'd let you
work with something second-rate?

76
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,194
Thank you.
You're worth it.

77
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,447
Now, do you think it's possible
for you two geniuses...

78
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,533
to give your tired old dad
a couple minutes quiet?

79
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:05,578
No! No!
I don't want to go there!

80
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,664
It's okay.
It's not okay!

81
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:11,793
You can't just dig into me, shove pointed
needles in my eyes and ask me what I see!

82
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:15,088
All right.
We won't go in.

83
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:20,051
Look. No test today.

84
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,470
No rutting test.
(sobbing)

85
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:25,640
Stupid son of a bitch dressed me up
like a gorram doll.

86
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:29,269
No tests, no shots. Come on.

87
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:32,397
I'm just gonna give you
a smoother cuttle--

88
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,816
River!

89
00:04:35,566 --> 00:04:36,401
Not him.

90
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:38,111
(cattle mooing)

91
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:41,406
(speaking Chinese)

92
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,825
(sobbing)

93
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:48,162
So, she's added cussing and hurling
about of things to her repertoire.

94
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,416
She really is a prodigy.
It's just a bad day.

95
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:55,253
No. A bad day is when someone's
yelling spooks the cattle.

96
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:59,257
Understand? Ever see cattle
stampede when they got no place to run?

97
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:03,261
It's kinda like a meat grinder,
and it'll lose us half our herd.

98
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,346
She hasn't gone anywhere near the cattle.
No.

99
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:08,599
But in case you hadn't noticed,
her voice kind of carries.

100
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:12,270
We're two miles above ground, and they can
probably hear her down there.

101
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,815
As soon as we unload, she can
holler until our ears bleed,

102
00:05:15,898 --> 00:05:18,276
although I would take it
as a kindness if she didn't.

103
00:05:18,609 --> 00:05:21,237
The human body can be drained of blood in
8.6 seconds,

104
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:23,448
given adequate vacuuming systems.

105
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:27,327
See, morbid and creepifying,
I got no problem with.

106
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:28,536
Long as she does it quiet-like.

107
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:33,291
This is paranoid schizophrenia, Captain,
handcrafted by government scientists...

108
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:36,878
who thought my sister's brain
was a rutting playground.

109
00:05:37,086 --> 00:05:40,381
I have no idea what'll set her off. If you
have some expertise--

110
00:05:40,465 --> 00:05:45,136
I'm not the doctor. And I'm not your
gorram baby-sitter either.

111
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:49,640
Gag her if you have to.
Got trade to be done.

112
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,072
You see that?

113
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:08,451
Fancy vessels such as that don't land here
unless they got somethin' to sell.

114
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:13,039
If it happens to be
somethin' we need... we take it.

00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:23,007

(speaks Chinese)

127
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,474
It's about time you broke in
them pretty shoes.

128
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,725
Hyah! Get along!

129
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,896
You know, they walk just as easy
if you lead 'em.

130
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,941
I like smacking 'em.

131
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,901
(cattle mooing)

132
00:07:24,819 --> 00:07:27,947
Hope this corral's
strong enough to hold 'em.

133
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:31,159
Shepherd's a purely
figurative title, you know.

134
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,370
Next time we smuggle stock,
let's make it something smaller.

135
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:38,291
Yeah, we should start dealing
in those black market beagles.

136
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:41,085
Hyah! Hyah!

137
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:45,381
Little soul, big world.

138
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:49,218
Eat, sleep...

139
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:50,386
and eat...

140
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:55,057
many souls.

141
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,977
Cattle on the ship three weeks,
she don't go near 'em.

142
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,981
Suddenly we're on Jiangyin, and she's got
a driving need to commune with the beasts.

143
00:08:02,273 --> 00:08:06,319
They weren't cows inside. They were
waiting to be, but they forgot.

144
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:09,405
Now they see sky, and
they remember what they are.

145
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:12,658
Is it bad that what she said
made perfect sense to me?

146
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,620
Come on now.
Let's get you clear of the work.

147
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,915
What's going on?
What are you doing?

148
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,460
I'm fixin' to do some business. I can't be
herdin' these steers and your sister too.

149
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,296
She didn't mean any harm.
I never figured she did.

150
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,757
But when a man engages
in clandestine dealings,

151
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,176
he has this preference
for things being smooth.

152
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:32,803
She makes things
not be smooth.

153
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:37,016
Right. I'm very sorry
if she tipped off anyone...

154
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:39,519
about your cunningly
concealed herd of cows.

155
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,023
I'm startin' to think you got a little too
much time on your hands, Doctor.

156
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,025
I think now I got
a notion regarding that.

157
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,944
Why don't you take your sister
for a little walk?

158
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:52,365
A walk?
Yeah. Someplace away.

159
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,953
It's probably best we stay close. Alliance
has us marked as fugitives.

160
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,914
Closest Alliance is the cruiser Magellan,
hours out from here,

161
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:02,583
and I promise you, they ain't comin'
to a backwater like Jiangyin.

162
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,920
Still, I'm not sure
it's such a wise suggestion.

163
00:09:06,462 --> 00:09:08,548
Might not want to mistake it
for a suggestion.

164
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,426
Don't worry.
We won't leave without you.

165
00:09:17,431 --> 00:09:19,892
Does it seem every supply store
on every border planet...

166
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,854
has the same five rag dolls
and the same wood carvings of--

167
00:09:24,021 --> 00:09:26,023
What is this? A duck?

168
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:30,820
That's a swan. I like it.
You do?

169
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:34,740
Looks like it was made
with, you know, longing.

170
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,661
Made by a person who really
longed to see a swan.

171
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:42,331
Perhaps because they'd only heard of them
by rough description.

172
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:47,461
Do you think this
would make a nice gift?

173
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,506
A gift? For whom?

174
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:57,305
I just kinda like it.
It's rich, you know.

175
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,974
Oh. For Simon.

176
00:10:01,684 --> 00:10:03,436
I didn't say that.

177
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:06,522
You don't do a very good job
of hiding your interest.

178
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:09,859
He's just so shuai.

179
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:14,113
You just wanna take a bite
out of him all over you know,

180
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:15,448
Careful.

181
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:17,450
Morning, you two.

182
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,703
Don't usually see you two
out and about planet-side.

183
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:25,082
Yeah, we're--we're trying
something different today.

184
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,585
River, uh...
be careful with that.

185
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:31,172
That's, um--
What is that?

186
00:10:31,505 --> 00:10:36,552
That's a postholer.
You dig holes... for posts.

187
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:39,430
It's-It's dirty and sharp.

188
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:42,933
Let's come over here.

189
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,272
"Jiangyin Prairie Paradise."

190
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:51,400
Good God! They're
askin' money for this crap?

191
00:10:54,236 --> 00:10:55,696
Hard to believe, ain't it?

192
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:58,282
Glad you're out.
Mmm.

193
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:01,786
Give you a chance
to have a little fun.

194
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:06,832
Fun? Right. I, uh--
I consider this fun.

195
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:11,379
It's fun being forced
to the ass end of the galaxy,

196
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:14,215
to get to live on a piece
of luh-suh wreck...

197
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:16,884
and eat molded protein,
and be bullied around by our...

198
00:11:16,967 --> 00:11:19,804
(speaking Chinese)
of a captain.

199
00:11:20,054 --> 00:11:23,432
That's fun.
Luh suh?

200
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:29,105
Sorry?
Serenity ain't luh suh.

201
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:32,024
No, I-I didn't mean--

202
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:35,403
Yeah, you did. You meant everything
you just said.

203
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:40,408
Well, no. Uh, actually
I was being ironic,

204
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,743
so in-in the strictest sense--

205
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:45,079
You were being mean...
is what.

206
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:49,250
And if that's what
you think of this life,

207
00:11:50,668 --> 00:11:53,295
then you can't think
much of them that choose it,

208
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:54,422
can you?

209
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:11,480
River?

210
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:20,990
This is the last time,
last time with cows.

211
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:24,493
Hey, there's an idea regarding beagles.
They have smallish droppings.

212
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:29,165
I believe so, sir. Also,
your disreputable men are here.

213
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:32,543
Better go take their money.

214
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,295

215
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:37,423
Mornin', gentlemen.
You must be the Grange brothers.

Hope you're in the mood
for beefsteak.

217
00:12:40,217 --> 00:12:42,344
Attractive animals,
ain't they?

218
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,556
They ain't well fed.
Scrawny.

219
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:49,143
Fei hua. Milk and hay
three times a day.

220
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:50,478
Fed to 'em
by beautiful women.

221
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:53,105
That was somethin' to see.
They's branded.

222
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:55,399
You boys are hittin'
all the sellin' points.

223
00:12:55,399 --> 00:12:58,235
The fresh brand's a dead giveaway.
Claim 'em as your own.

224
00:12:59,653 --> 00:13:02,573
Twenty a head.
That's an amusing figure,

225
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,784
in light of you already agreed
on 30 with Badger.

226
00:13:04,867 --> 00:13:06,702
That's before we seen 'em. They're
atrophied.

227
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,746
Standin' on a ship for near a month.

228
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:13,250
My comprehension is the less muscle,
the more tender the meat. Thirty.

229
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,255
Problem?
No.

230
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:20,758
About a minute from now,
we'll agree on 25.

233
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:49,620
Morning, officers.

234
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:04,426
I'm thinkin' maybe
we walk away entirely.

235
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,306
I'm thinkin' you do that,
and we got ourselves trouble.

236
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:15,729
Mornin', ladies. Serious trouble
of the "you owe us" variety.

237

I can go to 25.

238

Well, we'll be takin' a loss.

Look at the letters.

294
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:50,147
Well, I'm looking at letters--

295
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,650
These phrases, they don't sound
anything like her.

296
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,362
Some of these words,
they're misspelled.

297
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,075
She started correcting
my spelling when she was three.

298
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:05,287
She's trying
to tell us something.

299
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,582
I think there's a code.

300
00:20:08,665 --> 00:20:10,167

A code?

301
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,293
Yes.

302
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:15,297
I always thought it was River who
was lost without her big brother.

303
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:18,926
Now I'm beginning to wonder if it isn't
the other way around.

304
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:24,223
Did you have a good time at the
Darbanvilles' ball this year?

305
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:25,557
What are you, uh--

306
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:28,060
River thought it was duller
than last year.

307
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,771
But since we don't know anybody
named Darbanville,

308
00:20:30,854 --> 00:20:31,939
I'm having trouble judging.

309
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,316
Did you even read these?
Well, of course I did.

310
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:38,278
It's one of her silly games.
You two are always playing.

311
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:42,407
She is trying to tell us something that
somebody doesn't want her to say.

312
00:20:42,991 --> 00:20:45,327
Simon, this is paranoid.

313
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:47,829
It's stress.

314
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:50,540
If they heard you talking like this at the
hospital,

315
00:20:50,624 --> 00:20:52,376
it could affect your entire future.

316
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,087

Everything you've
worked for your whole life?

322
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:14,231
Being a doctor means more to you
than just a position.

323
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,440
I know that.

324
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:20,028
A few months time, you'll turn around,
and there she'll be.

325

you two apart for long.

Go!

Wasn't anywhere.

333
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,225
He was in town.
We saw him there.

334
00:21:50,350 --> 00:21:51,351
Him and River. I can show you--

335
00:21:51,435 --> 00:21:55,439
The town's not that big. Believe me when
I say he wasn't there.

336
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:57,983
Knew it. Probably saw
them cops, turned tail.

337
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,403
Doctor could be called a lot of things.
Coward wouldn't be one of them though.

338
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:03,238
You don't think they were arrested,
do you?

339
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,823
Worse than that, probably.

340
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:07,242
Looks like they got snatched.
Kidnapped?

341
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,745
I went by the sheriff's office. If we'd
checked the posted alerts,

342
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:10,996
we might've known it.

343
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:15,208
Settlers up in the hills take people
sometimes, usually tradesmen and the like.

344
00:22:16,126 --> 00:22:18,003
And now they got
themselves a doctor.

345
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:21,048
And we don't.
We're going.

346
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:25,052
Wh-What are you doing?
What about Simon and River?

347
00:22:25,052 --> 00:22:27,512
Forget them. We already
lost two people today.

348
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,640
If I can help it,
we won't lose a third.

349
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,267
Wash, get us in the air.

350
00:22:37,272 --> 00:22:40,650
We're lost.
Lost in the woods.

351
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,944
It's gonna be okay.
They'll find us.

352
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:47,282
Once the captain realizes what happened,
they'll come.

353
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:56,249
See there?
No one's comin' for you.

354
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,210
You just keep movin'.

355
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,476
That bad?

356
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:18,021
Battle wounds are nothin'
new to me, preacher.

357
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:22,317
I've seen men live with a dozen holes
in 'em this size.

358
00:23:22,901 --> 00:23:25,112
Is that right?
Surely is.

359
00:23:25,612 --> 00:23:28,824
I knew a man who had a hole
clean through his shoulder once.

360
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:31,618
Used to keep a spare
hankie in there.

361
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:37,499
Where's the doctor?
Not back yet?

362
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:41,878
We don't make him hurry
for the little stuff.

363
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,339
He'll be along.

364
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:48,969
You could hurry a little.

365
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,893
Well, there's Greenleaf.
They'd have med help there.

366
00:23:57,811 --> 00:24:01,106
Too far. More than 10 hours.
Guy's worse off than that.

367
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,191
You know where you can find
what you need.

368
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,485
Don't recall inviting you onto the bridge.
You didn't.

369
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:08,238
Mal, you know where you can find a doctor.
You know exactly--

370
00:24:08,321 --> 00:24:10,991
Inara, he was dumb enough to get himself
grabbed in broad daylight.

371
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:13,243
Don't have time to be beating
the trees, looking for him now.

372
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,954
No assurance we'd find him or that he
wouldn't need a doctor himself.

373
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,331
I'm not talking about Simon.

374
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:22,085
I'm talking
about medical facilities.

375
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:24,546
That's not an option,

376
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,673
nor is it a discussion I much want to
have at the moment.

377
00:24:26,756 --> 00:24:28,967
It doesn't matter what you want.
He's dying...

378
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,969
and we need a doctor now.

379
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:41,021
Look at what we got!
Got ourselves a doctor.

380
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:46,359
A real doctor.
Stand up straight.

381
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:50,572
WOMAN: They brought home a doctor.
Thank the Lord.

382
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,450
MAN: Come on! We have to go
down there and see!

383
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:58,121
MAN: What is it?

384
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:11,009
"Dear Diary, Today I was pompous,
and my sister was crazy.

385
00:25:11,092 --> 00:25:13,887
"Today we were kidnapped by hill folk,
never to be seen again.

386
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:16,848
It was the best day ever."

387
00:25:18,433 --> 00:25:20,227
Now we're talkin'.

388
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,109
Amazing we kept 'em
this long.

389
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,332
Can I
Sure.

390
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,334
He's out, though.

391
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,338
He did this for me once.

392
00:25:50,131 --> 00:25:53,301
(sighs)
How's he doin'?

393
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,512
I cleaned it out,
wrapped it up.

394
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:56,888
Best I could do.

395
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,226
I don't know.

396
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:04,521
Well, we're headed
for help, right?

397
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,398
Captain will
come up with a plan.

398
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,693
Well, that's good. Right?

399
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,655
Possible you're not recalling
some of his previous plans.

400
00:26:19,411 --> 00:26:21,329
We left them back there.

401
00:26:22,956 --> 00:26:23,873
Yeah.

402
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,211
Don't seem right.

403
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,423
You sure this is
where you want to be?

404
00:26:31,506 --> 00:26:34,217
Oh, I'm fairly
certain it ain't.

405
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:42,642
(radio static)

406
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:45,395
Be sure to ask nicely.

407
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:49,232
Alliance cruiser Magellan, this
is Firefly transport Serenity...

408
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:53,528
requesting permission
for docking.

409
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,157
MAN: (on radio) Firefly transport
Serenity, stand by for docking orders.

410
00:26:58,575 --> 00:26:59,576
In here.

411
00:27:01,494 --> 00:27:03,997
I don't figure it's
as fancy as you're used to,

412
00:27:03,997 --> 00:27:07,000
but it's what we got.

413
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,460
I got you a doctor.

414
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,503
Oh, praise the Lord.

415
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,591
Doralee here'll
show you what's what.

416
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:17,177
What's your name?
Simon.

417
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,263
Well, hello there.
Who are you?

418
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:23,600
This is River.
River, just, uh...

419
00:27:23,933 --> 00:27:26,144
just sit down...
over there.

420
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:34,402
Has there been a--
Is there a sickness here?

421
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:38,865
Nothing special. Just people get sick
or injured.

422
00:27:39,282 --> 00:27:43,036
Mostly people heal on their own,
but sometimes--

423
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,954
Sometimes you need a doctor.

424
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:52,879
WOMAN: (coughing)
Bring me light and any supplies you have.

425
00:28:05,558 --> 00:28:09,020
You sanguine about the kind of reception
we're apt to receive on an Alliance ship?

426
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:11,898
Absolutely.
What's "sanguine" mean?

427
00:28:11,981 --> 00:28:15,110
Sanguine. Hopeful. Plus, point of
interest,

428
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,445
(bell buzzing)
it also means "bloody."

429
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,572
That pretty much covers
all the options, don't it?

430
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:31,835
We're requesting aid.
No other purpose.

431
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,086
We got papers.

432
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:35,922
What's your business?

433
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,674
We're a supply ship, freelance.

434
00:28:37,757 --> 00:28:39,509
Had an accident this morning.
A crewman got hurt.

435
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:43,847
We need medical help.
Fast would be better than slow.

436
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:49,894
Official seal's out of date,
Captain... Harbatkin?

437
00:28:49,978 --> 00:28:53,523
We ain't been through a checkpoint in a
while, sir. You gonna see to my man?

438
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:55,650
How did this happen?
He--

439
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,319
Bystander in a gunfight back on Jiangyin.
You can check.

440
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,406
Not he nor any of ours
were the aggressors.

441
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,074
We aren't an emergency facility, Captain.

442
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:04,993
Our services aren't available simply
to anyone--

443
00:29:05,076 --> 00:29:07,412
Get... my...

444
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:12,834
my ident card.

445
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:32,353
Get this man
to the infirmary at once.

446
00:29:36,816 --> 00:29:39,235
Keep that bandage clean
now, you understand?

447
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,491
DORALEE: She's not quite right, is she?

448
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:47,827
SIMON: She's been through some trauma.
She's recovering, though.

449
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:54,250
She won't get a good conversation
out of Ruby. I can tell you that much.

450
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:55,919
That little girl's mute.

451
00:29:56,961 --> 00:30:00,215
Do you know the cause?
Was she born deaf?

452
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:03,760
No. She was fine until two years ago
when she stopped talking.

453
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:09,182
A place like this
might be good for your sister.

454
00:30:09,390 --> 00:30:13,311
Quiet, safe. A place where
folks take care of each other.

455
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:18,399
Mmm, yes. Seems like a lovely little
community of kidnappers.

456
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,945
The Lord says judge not.
They took us off the street.

457
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:25,073
Sometimes life takes you places
you weren't expectin' to go.

458
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:28,117
Life didn't bring us here.
Those men did.

459
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:32,288
You were on a transport ship,
right? Takin' a journey?

460
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:35,792
It's the way of life in my
findings that journeys end...

461
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,628
when and where they want to, and that's
where you make your home.

462
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:40,797
This isn't our home.

463
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:44,968
If it isn't here,
where is it?

464
00:30:49,138 --> 00:30:52,600
(sighs)
This place gives me an uncomfortableness.

465
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:57,272
So what do you figure? Shepherd's got some
kind of connection with the Alliance?

466
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:00,567
I know what it looks like. Still, it would
surprise me if he did.

467
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:03,486
See? That's my whole problem
with pickin' up tourists.

468
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,738
They ain't never
what they claim to be.

469
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,991
Does seem like everyone's
got a tale to tell.

470
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,751
River?

471
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:24,340
River?
What's wrong?

472
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:27,552
River's gone.
So's the girl.

473
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,179
Ruby.
I'll check out back.

474
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:38,688
River! Don't--
What is that?

475
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,691
For you.
Oh.

476
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,193
I picked them.

477
00:31:44,193 --> 00:31:47,739
WOMAN: (coughing)

478
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:51,242
Here.
They'll stain your dress.

479
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,417
You have to eat.

480
00:32:01,377 --> 00:32:03,004
Hodgeberries.

481
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:06,674
Do you remember when we found those

482
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,927
giant hodgeberry bushes
on the Cambersons' estate?

483
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,055
And we thought they'd
grown wild, but--

484
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:17,352
It was a long while ago.

485
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,232
I took you away from there.
No.

486
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,610
I know I did.

487
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:29,197
You don't think I do, but--

488
00:32:31,908 --> 00:32:33,242
I get confused.

489
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,664
I remember everything.

490
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:40,625
I remember too much.

491
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,878
And some of it's made up...

492
00:32:44,253 --> 00:32:48,049
and some of it
can't be quantified...

493
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,176
and there's secrets--

494
00:32:50,259 --> 00:32:52,011
Hey. It's okay.

495
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:55,348
But I understand.

496
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,519
You gave up everything
you had to find me.

497
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,562
You found me broken.

498
00:33:03,690 --> 00:33:04,899
It's hard for you.

499
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,195
You gave up
everything you had.

500
00:33:09,278 --> 00:33:13,825
Mei-mei, everything I have
is right here.

501
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:21,332
You need to eat,
keep up your strength.

502
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,293
We won't be here long.

503
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,422
Daddy will come
and take us home.

504
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,468
And I'll get better.

505
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:36,055
I'll get better.

506
00:33:42,645 --> 00:33:44,772
These are better than
the Cambersons' berries.

507
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,067
They are...
except they're poison.

508
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:54,032
(laughs)
You believed her. Made a face.

509
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,660
You are such a brat.

510
00:33:58,494 --> 00:33:59,912
You get to bed now.

511
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:03,458
We should probably think
about doing the same.

512
00:34:04,167 --> 00:34:07,545
It's been a big day,
what with the abduction and all.

513
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:10,256
Well, y'all don't
have to sleep here.

514
00:34:10,506 --> 00:34:12,258
There's a house
set aside for you.

515
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:15,553
We've been looking for a doctor for a good
while, so things are ready.

516
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,346
Really?

517
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:19,557
Her sister got killed.

518
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:24,020
Her mother got crazy,
killed the sister.

519
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:28,024
That one lived.
Ruby talked to you, honey?

520
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,444
It's true
what she's saying.

521
00:34:32,195 --> 00:34:35,031
Poor woman went out of her mind,
tried to kill her two girls.

522
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:36,908
Ruby lived.

523
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:41,037
Sweetheart,
you are an angel.

524
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,457
No one's been able to get Ruby to speak
even a peep.

525
00:34:44,707 --> 00:34:47,919
(laughs)
It's a miracle! That's what it is.

526
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:50,421
Ruby doesn't talk.

527
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,549
Her voice got scared away.

528
00:34:55,635 --> 00:34:58,763
(crickets chirping)
I hear crickets.

529
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:02,225
I don't understand.
If Ruby didn't talk,

530
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,560
h-how do you know--

531
00:35:04,644 --> 00:35:08,898
My sister's--
She's very good at--

532
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,237
What's wrong?

533
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,448
"And they shall be
among the people.

534
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,577
"And they shall speak truths
and whisper secrets.

535
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,080
And you will know them
by their crafts."

536
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:28,209
What are you talking about?

537
00:35:31,045 --> 00:35:34,298
"Thou shalt not suffer
a witch to live."

538
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:56,904
Have you completely lost your mind?
Pretty nearly.

539
00:35:57,196 --> 00:36:00,616
We got the wave at the Friedlichs. I had
to leave your mother at the dinner table.

540
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,827
I'm sorry, Dad.

541
00:36:03,703 --> 00:36:05,705
You know, I would never have tried to save
River's life...

542
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:08,457
if I had known there was
a dinner party at risk.

543
00:36:08,457 --> 00:36:10,168
Don't you dare
be flippant with me.

544
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,503
I spent 2,000 credits
to get you out of here.

545
00:36:12,587 --> 00:36:16,966
I had to walk through that door, which
goes on my permanent profile.

546
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:21,387
Are you trying
to destroy this family?

547
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,139
I didn't realize
it would be so easy.

548
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,476
Dad, I didn't do anything.

549
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,936
You were in a blackout zone.

550
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,565
Talking to someone who
might be able to help River.

551
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:36,152
And I'm going right back there.
(speaking Chinese)

552
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:38,571
This is a slippery
slope, young man.

553
00:36:38,571 --> 00:36:40,323
You have no idea
how far down you can go,

554
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:44,076
and you're not taking us with you.
Meaning what?

555
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:46,913
I won't come
for you again.

556
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:50,833
You end up here or get
mixed up in something worse,

557
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:52,460
you're on your own.

558
00:36:53,419 --> 00:36:55,171
I will not come for you.

559
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,636
Now, are you coming home?

560
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:08,434
(bell clanging)
This is lunacy!

561
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:12,480
You're supposed to be the teacher here.
What exactly is it that you teach?

562
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:15,650
What's going on, woman? Why are you
knocking us from our beds at this hour?

563
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:20,321
The new doctor's sister's a witch! She
read Ruby's mind, saw things she couldn't.

564
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:25,326
No, River is not a witch!
She's just a troubled girl.

565
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,995
I'm sure that's true.

566
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,709
You're not a witch, are you?
(speaking Chinese)

567
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:37,004
I'm the patron here.
Do you know what that means?

568
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,840
Yes. You're in charge.

569
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:43,177
Ever since
the old patron died.

570
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:44,220
That's right.

571
00:37:45,346 --> 00:37:48,182
He was sick...
and he was getting better.

572
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,559
You were alone
in the room with him.

573
00:37:51,185 --> 00:37:53,145
(gasps)
No!

574
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:55,856
PATRON: This girl reads minds
and spins falsehoods!

575
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:58,901
She's a witch, and we must purge the devil
from her! With fire!

576
00:37:58,985 --> 00:38:00,987
(screaming)

577
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:13,040
MAL: You're gonna be fine, Shepherd.
Alliance patched you up.

578
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:15,126
Alliance?

579
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:19,088
Yeah. They let us come,
and they let us go.

580
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:23,259
What kind of ident card gets us that kind
of reception and send-off?

581
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:29,724
I am a shepherd.
Folks like a man of God.

582
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:33,311
No, they don't. Men of God make everyone
feel guilty and judged.

583
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,646
That's not what I saw.

584
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,774
You like to tell me
what really happened?

585
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:45,531
I surely would...
and maybe someday I will.

586
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:50,619
(sighs)
It's good to be home.

587
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:57,752
Badger just hailed us.
Getting impatient for his share.

588
00:38:57,835 --> 00:39:00,129
Wants us to drop it to his men
on the Kowlan fed base.

589
00:39:00,212 --> 00:39:03,549
That'll be a hell of a lot easier to do
without the two most wanted on board.

590
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:06,635
Life would look to be simpler
with us not carrying 'fugees.

591
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,721
He is right, you know.

592
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:13,934
Yeah. Simpler.

593
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:18,981
(chattering, shouting)

594
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:33,454
Take me instead.
Take my life for hers.

595
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,248
The witch must die.
God commands it.

596
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:39,835
MAN:
Up here!

597
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:44,382
No! Get away from her!

598
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,768
She has done nothing to you!

599
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:01,690
If she dies tonight, it won't
be God's will that killed her!

600
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:06,404
It'll be you! Your lunacy!
Your ignorance!

601
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,697
(townspeople murmuring)

602
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:28,092
That's not gonna
stop us, Doctor.

603
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:35,766
Postholer.
Digging holes for posts.

604
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:51,782
Light it.

605
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,911
Time to go.

606
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,792
(spacecraft approaching)
(townspeople murmuring)

607
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:12,052
(gasps, shouting)

608
00:41:14,054 --> 00:41:19,560
Well, look at this! Appears we got here
just in the nick of time!

609
00:41:20,227 --> 00:41:21,604
What does that make us?

610
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:25,191
Big damn heroes, sir.
Ain't we just?

611
00:41:25,733 --> 00:41:27,234
Sorry to interrupt, folks.

612
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:29,778
Y'all got somethin'
that belongs to us,

613
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:30,988
and we'd like it back.

614
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:34,450
This is a holy cleansing. You cannot
think to thwart God's will.

615
00:41:35,367 --> 00:41:39,205
Y'all see the man hangin' out of the
spaceship with the really big gun?

616
00:41:41,123 --> 00:41:43,709
I'm not sayin'
you weren't easy to find.

617
00:41:43,792 --> 00:41:47,338
But it was kinda out of our way,
and he didn't want to come.

618
00:41:47,546 --> 00:41:49,715
Man's lookin'
to kill some folk.

619
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:53,385
So really it's his will y'all
should worry about thwarting.

620
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:58,849
Gotta say, Doctor, your talent for
alienatin' folks is near miraculous.

621
00:41:59,975 --> 00:42:01,560
Yes, I'm very proud.

622
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:05,314
Cut her down.
The girl is a witch.

623
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:10,027
Yeah, but she's our witch,
so cut her the hell down.

624
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:22,331
Hey, Doctor. Glad you're
back now on the ship.

625
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:25,543
Thanks.

626
00:42:34,343 --> 00:42:36,095
I've moved him to his room.

627
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:38,597
How's he faring?

628
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:42,017
He's gonna be fine. Yeah.
They took good care of him.

629
00:42:42,476 --> 00:42:43,644
Good to know.

630
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:48,190
So finally a decent wound
on this ship, and I miss out.

631
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:50,526
I'm sorry.

632
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:53,195
You were busy trying to get
yourself lit on fire.

633
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:54,280
It happens.

634
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:56,699
Captain?

635
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:01,328
Why did you come back for us?
You're on my crew.

636
00:43:01,412 --> 00:43:06,083
Yeah, but you don't even like me.
Why'd you come back?

637
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:10,629
You're on my crew. Why are we
still talking about this?

638
00:43:10,629 --> 00:43:13,507
Chow's in ten.
No need to dress.

639
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:27,563
MAL: So the shepherd says to the
Companion, "A good goat will do that."

640
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:29,732
(laughter)

641
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:43,662
Great.

642
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:28,165
Grr! Arrgh!
