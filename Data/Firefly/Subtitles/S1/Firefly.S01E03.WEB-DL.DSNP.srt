00:00:00,917 --> 00:00:04,045
MAN: After the Earth was used up,
we found a new solar system,

2
00:00:04,045 --> 00:00:07,340
and hundreds of new Earths
were terraformed and colonized.

3
00:00:07,757 --> 00:00:09,426
The central planets
formed the Alliance...

4
00:00:09,592 --> 00:00:12,429
and decided all the planets
had to join under their rule.

5
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:15,849
There was some disagreement
on that point.

6
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,601
After the war, many of the Independents
who had fought and lost...

7
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:20,437
drifted to the edges
of the system,

8
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:22,731
far from Alliance control.

9
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:26,192
Out here, people struggled to get by with
the most basic technologies.

10
00:00:26,568 --> 00:00:27,944
A ship would bring you work.

11
00:00:28,319 --> 00:00:29,946
A gun would help you keep it.

12
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,781
A captain's goal was simple:

13
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:34,242
Find a crew, find a job.

14
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:36,453
Keep flying.

15
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:43,126
Over here!
(grunts)

16
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:46,087
(yelling, cheering,
hooting)

17
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,383
Yeah! Too tall!
Too tall!

18
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:52,260
Jayne!
Little man!

19
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:55,472
(yelling continues)

20
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:01,227
Ah!
Yes!

21
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:04,314
JAYNE: Come on, little man!
Ha ha!

22
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,025
Shoot it!

23
00:01:08,151 --> 00:01:10,779
(yelling, laughing)

24
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,824
Right behind you--
Yeah!

25
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,119
JAYNE: (shouting,
indistinct)

26
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:19,704
Hello.

27
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,039
Who's winning?

28
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,165
I can't really tell.

29
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:26,544
They don't seem to be playing
by any civilized rules that I know.

30
00:01:26,711 --> 00:01:28,797
Well, we're pretty far
from civilization.

31
00:01:31,257 --> 00:01:32,884
INARA:
How's your sister?

32
00:01:32,967 --> 00:01:35,178
She's good. Better.

33
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:37,305
She has her days,

34
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:41,601
and she still won't talk about what it was
that they did to her at the academy.

35
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,229
INARA: Perhaps she's not
sure herself.

36
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:46,314
Open!

37
00:01:46,314 --> 00:01:48,191
Aah!
Good eye! Good eye!

38
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:52,278
She dreams about it.
I know that much.

39
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,155
Nightmares.
WASH: (grunting) Right behind you.

40
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:57,075
And now, on the run,
on this ship...

41
00:01:57,158 --> 00:02:01,204
I don't know if I'll be able to help
her here, and I need to help her.

42
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:03,081
Simon, you are.

43
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:05,333
Leaving your whole world
behind?

44
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,669
That's incredibly
selfless.

45
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:09,170
JAYNE: Nice!
Yeah.

46
00:02:09,254 --> 00:02:11,172
(shouting, grunting continues)
I selflessly turned us both

47
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,258
into wanted fugitives.

48
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:15,844
Well, we're all running
from something, I suppose.

49
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,432
(alarm sounding)

50
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:22,350
Proximity alert.

51
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:23,810
We must be coming up
on something.

52
00:02:23,893 --> 00:02:26,020
Oh, my God.
What can it be?

53
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:29,399
We're all doomed!
Who's flying this thing?

54
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:31,317
Oh, right.
That would be me.

55
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:33,194
Uh, back to work.

56
00:02:33,862 --> 00:02:36,322
So that makes us one man short.

57
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:38,366
Yeah. Little Kaylee's
always one man short.

58
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:40,285
Ow! Hey!

59
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:44,247
Say, Doc, why don't you
come on down, play for our side.

60
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:46,374
Inara won't mind.

61
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:56,718
(beeps)

62
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:01,014
Aah!

63
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,229
Wash, you have a stroke
or something?

64
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:11,024
Near enough.
What happened?

65
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:18,156
(speaks Chinese)
Anybody home?

66
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,365
I've been hailing her, but if whoever's
there

67
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:21,910
is as healthy as the guy we just ran over,

68
00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,746
I can't imagine anybody's gonna be
picking up.

69
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:26,706
Bring us in a little closer.

70
00:03:26,789 --> 00:03:28,833
Get you close enough
to ring the doorbell.

71
00:03:29,584 --> 00:03:31,002
What is it?

72
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,343
It's a ghost.

MAL: So, what do we figure?
Transport ship?

85
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:41,698
Converted cargo hauler.
Maybe a short-range scow.

86
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,075
You can see she don't
wanna be parked like that.

87
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:48,621
The port thrust's gone, and that's what's
making her spin the way she is.

88
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:51,291
A short-range vessel
this far out into space?

89
00:04:51,374 --> 00:04:53,084
Retrofitted
to carry passengers.

90
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,461
Travelers pick them up cheap
at government auction.

91
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,714
A few modifications, and they serve
well enough

92
00:04:57,797 --> 00:04:59,799
for a one-way push
to the outer planets.

93
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,676
Settlers.

94
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:06,014
Cram 15, maybe 20 families on a boat that
size, you pack 'em in tight enough.

95
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:08,808
Families?
Tell you what I think.

96
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,936
I figure that fella we run into
did everyone on board.

97
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,604
Killed 'em all.

98
00:05:13,896 --> 00:05:17,442
Then he decided to take a swim, see how
fast his blood would boil out his ears.

99
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,319
You're a very "up" person.

100
00:05:19,777 --> 00:05:24,240
Shouldn't we report this?
To who? The Alliance?

101
00:05:24,657 --> 00:05:26,242
Right. They're gonna run right out here

102
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,411
lickety-split and make sure these
taxpayers are okay.

103
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,787
Then we'll have to.

104
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:33,708
If there's folks in need of help, why
aren't they beamin' no distress call?

105
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,501
It's true. There's no beacon.

106
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:37,337
Which means it's likely no one's looking
to find her.

107
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:40,173
All the more reason for us
to do the right thing.

108
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:43,509
How's about you just say a prayer
when we slide on by?

109
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,304
Shall I remind you of the story
of the Good Samaritan?

110
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:49,223
I'd rather you didn't.
But we'll check it out.

111
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:52,435
Could be survivors,
and if not, well, then,

112
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,687
no one's gonna mind if we take a look
around and see

113
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:57,065
if there's not something of
value they might've left behind.

114
00:05:57,065 --> 00:06:00,109
Yeah--No, uh,
someone could be hurt.

115
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:12,997
(buzzer)

116
00:06:20,713 --> 00:06:22,757
Where do you think
you're headed?

117
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:27,929
Thought I'd offer
my services,

118
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:30,306
in case anyone on board
required medical attention.

119
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,478
Well, the captain and Zoe
are goin' in first.

120
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,731
We'll holler if we need ya.

121
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:41,401
Somethin' wrong?
Hmm?

122
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:46,072
Oh. No. No, I--

123
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:50,326
Well, I--I suppose it's just the thought
of a little Mylar and glass...

124
00:06:50,326 --> 00:06:52,995
being the only thing
separating a person from...

125
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:54,956
nothing.

126
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,291
It's impressive what "nothing"
can do to a man.

127
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,460
Like that feller
we bumped into.

128
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,004
He's likely stuck up under our belly
about now.

129
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,256
That's what space trash does you know--

130
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:07,260
kinda latches on the first big
somethin' stops long enough.

131
00:07:08,928 --> 00:07:10,471
Hey, now.

132
00:07:10,555 --> 00:07:13,808
That'd be a bit like you and your sister,
wouldn't it?

133
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:35,663
(buzzer)

134
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:43,880
Entering adjoining
air lock now.

135
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:52,805
Okay, Wash, ask Serenity
to knock for us.

136
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:54,932
(buzzer)

137
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,778
Emergency power's up.

138
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,697
Dashboard light.

139
00:08:35,973 --> 00:08:37,600
MAL: Whatever happened here
happened quick.

140
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:56,327
Everything was left on.

141
00:08:58,829 --> 00:09:00,706
Ship powered down
on its own.

142
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,585
No sign of a struggle.

143
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,631
They're just
Gone.

144
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,307
Sir.

145
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:23,938
Personal log. Someone was in the middle
of an entry.

146
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,903

(gasps)

147
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:33,114
(panting, whimpering)

148
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:35,199
(sobbing)

149
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:39,870
(sobbing continues)
Shh, shh, shh.

150
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:44,292
It's okay.
It's okay. I'm here.

151
00:09:44,667 --> 00:09:47,253
(continues panting,
sobbing)

152
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:49,171
Bad dreams again?

153
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:52,758
I--I can't sleep. There's too much
screaming.

154
00:09:57,930 --> 00:10:00,308
River, there is--

155
00:10:00,308 --> 00:10:02,226
there is no screaming.

156
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,354
(whispers)
There was.

157
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:09,233
Hey. Grab your med kit.
Let's hoof it.

158
00:10:09,984 --> 00:10:12,153
Mal wants us both over there
on the double.

159
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,698
They found survivors?

160
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,991
Didn't say.

161
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:18,701
Right.

162
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,371
Uh, I-I'll ask Inara
to look in on River.

163
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,206
Whatever.
I ain't waitin'.

164
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:28,294
I'll meet you over there. But don't take
forever. Still gotta get suited up.

165
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:32,465
(buzzer)

166
00:10:48,939 --> 00:10:50,524
(door slams)
(gasps)

167
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:57,698
(labored breathing)

168
00:11:14,006 --> 00:11:15,800
Hi.

169
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,054
(grunting)

170
00:11:22,932 --> 00:11:25,893
(panting)

171
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,690
Um, what are you doing here?
And what's with the suit?

172
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:35,861
(continues panting)
You're hilarious.

173
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,989
SIMON: Sadist.
All right, enough.

174
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:40,449
Ain't got time for games.

175
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:44,078
As long as you're here, you may as well
lend a hand. You can roll with Kaylee.

176
00:11:44,787 --> 00:11:46,455
Let's be quick about this people.
All right.

177
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:48,290
A few loads each. No need to be greedy.

178
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,959
Where are
all the people?

179
00:11:50,167 --> 00:11:51,752
Ship says lifeboat launched more
than a week ago.

180
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:53,796
\We're gonna assume everyone got off okay.

181
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:56,549
Anyway, we're just here to pick the bones,
so you two start in the engine room.

182
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:58,467
Jayne, you take the galley.

183
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:02,346
You, um, have this on wrong.

184
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:08,769
(laughs)

185
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:13,399
Sir, I count 16 families
signed on.

186
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:15,317
Lifeboat wouldn't hold
a third of that.

187
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,862
I know.
Wash, any luck?

188
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,947
Think I found something that pretty well
matches that class.

189
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:21,365
The layout looks about right.

190
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:24,785
Seems to me any valuables,
if there are any,

191
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,746
would likely be stored
somewhere...

192
00:12:27,121 --> 00:12:28,873
"C" Deck, aft.

193
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:31,876
Good work. Keep the engine running.
We shouldn't be long.

194
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:38,507
River? It's Inara.

195
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,470
Are you hungry,
sweetie?

196
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:47,975
River?

197
00:13:02,072 --> 00:13:03,866
SIMON: Aren't you the least bit curious?

198
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:05,534
About what?

199
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:09,205
Well,
what happened here.

200
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:13,250
I mean, why would anybody abandon their
ship in the middle of nowhere like this?

201
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:17,213
For all sorts of reasons.
Just not mechanical.

202
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:21,091
What? There ain't nothin'
wrong with this.

203
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:23,844
Not that I can see, anyhow.

204
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,972
Whoo!
(chuckles)

205
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,974
Well, there's a good one.

206
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,685
(grunts)
Hold the bag open.

207
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,961
This looks to be it.

208
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:01,966
(beeping)

209
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:04,176
Locked.

210
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:07,680
Well, now, I'd say that's like to be
a very good sign.

211
00:15:14,997 --> 00:15:16,123
MAL: Here.

212
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,879
Gen-seed, protein,
crop supplements.

213
00:15:21,962 --> 00:15:23,505
Everything a growing family needs...

214
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,633
to make a fresh start
on a new world.

215
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,469
Hard subsidies
for 14-plus families.

216
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:32,723
That's--
About a fortune.

217
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,934
Forget the rest.
We just take this stuff.

218
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:37,394
Gonna need a hand
hauling it out of here.

219
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:45,444
Sir, even on a lifeboat...

220
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:49,657
you'd think those who escaped would find
room for some of this.

221
00:15:52,242 --> 00:15:53,535
MAL: Nobody escaped.

222
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,412
ZOE: Sir?

223
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,334
Nobody.

224
00:16:06,590 --> 00:16:07,675
My God.

225
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,219
(speaks Chinese)

226
00:16:11,387 --> 00:16:13,472
I know what did this.

227
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,516
Get her out of here.
Jayne?

228
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,352
MAL: Jayne, drop what you're doing
and get to the engine room.

229
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:20,437
I want you to take Kaylee and the doctor
off this boat.

230
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,982
Don't ask questions.

231
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:24,692
(yelling)

232
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,277
MAL: (on radio)
Jayne?

233
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:31,031
(gunshot)

234
00:16:32,282 --> 00:16:33,367
Captain?

235
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:36,245
Captain.
(gunshot)

236
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,205
Zoe!

237
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,207
Came from above, sir.

238
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,418
The galley.

239
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:45,629
What?
KAYLEE: We heard shootin'.

240
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:47,631
River, what are you--

241
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,841
I followed the voices.

242
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:52,761
Don't ever leave the ship. Not ever.
Handle her, will you, son?

243
00:16:52,845 --> 00:16:54,847
WASH: (on radio) What in the (Chinese)
is going on in there?

244
00:16:54,930 --> 00:16:55,973
Not now, dear.

245
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:14,074
What'd you see?
(panting)

246
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,242
Didn't.

247
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,454
Came at me from behind.
Big, though.

248
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:19,955
Strong.

249
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:23,542
I think I might have hit him.
You did.

250
00:17:43,479 --> 00:17:46,774
MAN: No. No, no.
MAL: Shh. Easy, now.

251
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:50,194
No one's gonna hurt you.

252
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:53,947
No. No mercy. No.
Any more than we already did.

253
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:56,909
No mercy.
We got lots of mercy.

254
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,911
We got lots and lots of--

255
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:02,372
(groans)

256
00:18:11,465 --> 00:18:12,925
SIMON:
Oh, yes.

257
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,052
He's a real beast.

258
00:18:16,762 --> 00:18:18,055
It's a wonder
you're still alive.

259
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:21,266
Looked bigger
when I couldn't see him.

260
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,939
I wonder how long
he'd been living like that.

261
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:28,816
Don't know.

262
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,944
He must be real brave to survive like that
when nobody else did.

263
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:36,115
(sniffs)
Yeah. Real hero, killin' all them people.

264
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,284
KAYLEE: What?
No, we don't believe that.

265
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:43,539
We don't, do we?

266
00:18:44,498 --> 00:18:47,751
Captain wouldn't have brought him on
board, were that the case.

267
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:49,670
SIMON: Pulse is rapid.

268
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:52,422
Blood pressure's high side of normal--
to be expected.

269
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:55,843
Weak.
They were all weak.

270
00:18:56,677 --> 00:18:59,638
Other than the bullet wound, there doesn't
appear to be any exterior trauma.

271
00:18:59,721 --> 00:19:02,641
Though that crack to the head you gave him
probably didn't do him any good.

272
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,935
(grunts, panting)
Cattle.

273
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,771
Cattle
for the slaughter.

274
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,400
Dope him.

275
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:13,944
I don't think that--
Just do it.

276
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:18,198
No mercy.
No resistance.

277
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,663
(groans)

278
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:27,708
(grunting)
(needle gun hisses)

279
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:31,628
Open up.
See what's inside.

280
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,883
(panting)

281
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,181
(whispers)
No mercy.

282
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:49,855
So? How's our patient?

283
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,774
Uh, aside from
borderline malnutrition,

284
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,401
he's in remarkably good health.

285
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,361
So he'll live, then?

286
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:58,071
Which, to my mind,
is unfortunate.

287
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,699
Not a very charitable attitude, Captain.

288
00:20:01,074 --> 00:20:02,993
Charity'd be putting a bullet in
his brainpan.

289
00:20:03,243 --> 00:20:04,077
Mal!

290
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:07,080
It'd save him the suffering.

291
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,460
All right.
No one goes in here.

292
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:14,588
Nothing more we can do for him,
not after what he's seen.

293
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:16,048
What do you mean?

294
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,760
That ship
was hit by reavers.

295
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,890
Reavers?
(speaks Chinese)

296
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,229
INARA: Mal, how can you know?

297
00:20:30,312 --> 00:20:33,315
JAYNE: He don't, that's how.
No way.

298
00:20:34,775 --> 00:20:36,652
It was that other fella,
the one we run into.

299
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:40,364
Like I said before, he went stir crazy,
killed the rest,

300
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:42,032
then took a walk in space.

301
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:44,952
Just a second ago, you said
Don't matter what I said.

302
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:48,247
Wasn't reavers. Reavers don't leave
no survivors.

303
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,332
Strictly speaking,
I wouldn't say they did.

304
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,376
What are you
suggesting?

305
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:54,920
Don't matter we took him
off that boat, Shepherd.

306
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,130
It's the place he's gonna live
from now on.

307
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:58,715
I don't accept that.

308
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,844
Whatever horror he witnessed,
whatever acts of barbarism,

309
00:21:02,928 --> 00:21:05,472
it was done by men,
nothing more.

310
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:09,268
Reavers ain't men.
Of course they are.

311
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:13,480
Too long removed from civilization,
perhaps, but men.

312
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:17,317
And I believe there's a power
greater than men.

313
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,736
A power that heals.

314
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:22,197
Reavers might take issue
with that philosophy,

315
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,157
if they had a philosophy,

316
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:27,286
and if they weren't too busy
gnawing on your insides.

317
00:21:28,495 --> 00:21:31,498
Jayne's right.
Reavers ain't men.

318
00:21:32,207 --> 00:21:35,419
Or they forgot how to be.
Come to just nothin'.

319
00:21:36,211 --> 00:21:38,297
They got out to the edge of the galaxy,
to that place of nothin',

320
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:39,548
and that's what they became.

321
00:21:39,965 --> 00:21:43,302
Why are we still sittin' here?
If it was reavers, shouldn't we be gone?

322
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,888
Work ain't done. Still substantial money
value sittin' over there.

323
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:50,183
Oh, I ain't goin' over there
with them bodies.

324
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:53,145
No ruttin' way.
Not if reavers messed with 'em.

325
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:55,689
Jayne,
you'll scare the women.

326
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,357
SIMON:
I'll go.

327
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:01,153
I've dealt with bodies. They don't worry
me.

328
00:22:01,361 --> 00:22:03,113
I'd like to go with him.

329
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:06,575
Maybe see what I can do about putting
those folks to rest.

330
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,619
Those folks are already restin' pretty
good, Shepherd. Reavers saw to that.

331
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:13,248
How we treat our dead is part of what
makes us different...

332
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:15,792
than those did the slaughtering.

333
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,383
All right. You go say your words.

334
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,677
Jayne, you'll help the doctor and Shepherd
Book cut down those people.

335
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:29,181
Then you'll load up the cargo.
I don't believe this.

336
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,058
We're sittin' put for a funeral?

337
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:34,227
Yes, Jayne, that is exactly
what we're gonna do.

338
00:22:34,227 --> 00:22:37,314
Not gonna have these people lookin' over
my shoulder once we're gone.

339
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:39,733
I ain't sayin'
there's any peace to be had,

340
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:43,653
but on the off chance there is,
those folks deserve a little of it.

341
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,829
Just when I think
I've got you figured out.

342
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,339
That was real pretty, Captain,
what you just said.

343
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:05,384
Didn't think you were one
for rituals and such.

344
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:08,929
I'm not. But I figure it'll keep
the others busy for a while.

345
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:11,306
No reason to concern them
with what's to be done.

346
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,349
Sir?

347
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:17,270
MAL: It's a real burden
being right so often.

348
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,564
What is that?
Booby trap.

349
00:23:19,981 --> 00:23:21,733
Reavers sometimes leave 'em
for the rescue ships.

350
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:25,070
Triggered it when we latched on.
And when we detach?

351
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,113
It blows.

352
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:30,242
Okay, so we don't detach.
We just, I don't know, sit tight until--

353
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,619
What, reavers come back?

354
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,914
Looks like they've jerry-rigged it
with a pressure catch.

355
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:38,625
It's the only thing that'd work
with all these spare parts.

356
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:42,295
We could probably bypass that easy,
we get to the D.C. line.

357
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,215
You tell me right now, little Kaylee.
You really think you can do this?

358
00:23:45,215 --> 00:23:46,925
Sure. Yeah.

359
00:23:49,219 --> 00:23:50,595
I think so.

360
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:55,016
Besides, if I mess up, it's not like
you'll be able to yell at me.

361
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,855
(nervous chuckle)

362
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:44,149
No. No!

363
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:48,195
(mutters) No mercy.
(panting)

364
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,998
(laughing)

365
00:25:09,382 --> 00:25:11,885
Aah! Aah!
(whimpers)

366
00:25:11,885 --> 00:25:14,763
Ohh! (continues whimpering)
Shh.

367
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:17,933
(loud crash)
(screaming)

368
00:25:52,092 --> 00:25:54,010
(grunts)

369
00:25:55,011 --> 00:25:55,929
What's goin' on?

370
00:25:56,263 --> 00:26:00,016
Well, right at this particular moment,
I have to say, not a thing.

371
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:02,894
Right?
KAYLEE: Not a gorram thing.

372
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:04,271
Looked like a thing to me.

373
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:07,566
Thought we might have had a situation,
but it looks to be taken care of.

374
00:26:07,816 --> 00:26:10,860
Let's get that merchandise
put away.

375
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:24,583
Everyone's home, Wash.
Let's go.

376
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,418
(alarm sounding)

377
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:30,672
No, no, don't you say that.
It's the reavers.

378
00:26:30,755 --> 00:26:33,592
The gorram reavers come back.
Get that stuff stored.

379
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,344
Like it's gonna matter!
Just do it!

380
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,888
(alarm continues)

381
00:26:40,348 --> 00:26:41,808
Reavers?

382
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,728
MAN: (over speaker)
Firefly-class transport,

383
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:47,272
you are ordered to release control
of your helm.

384
00:26:47,355 --> 00:26:49,149
Prepare to dock
and be boarded.

385
00:26:57,365 --> 00:27:00,201
Looks like civilization
finally caught up with us.

386
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,086
CREW MEMBER:
Initiate molecular run.

387
00:27:13,256 --> 00:27:15,383
No mandatory registration markings
on the bow.

388
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:17,385
Make sure we cite them
for that.

389
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:21,056
Sir, we've identified the transport ship
they were attached to.

390
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:23,808
It was licensed to a group of families
out of Bernadette.

391
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,311
They were due to touch down
in Newhall three weeks ago.

392
00:27:26,853 --> 00:27:27,937
Never made it.

393
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:30,857
Once we secure these vultures, we'll send
a team over, check it out.

394
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:33,234
Sir, didn't we have a flag on a Firefly
a while back?

395
00:27:33,234 --> 00:27:35,195
Check.

396
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:38,907
Oh, here it is.

397
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,327
An alert issued on an unidentified
Firefly-class...

398
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:45,497
believed to be carrying two fugitives--
a brother and sister.

399
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,791
What are they wanted for?

400
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:50,126
It's not available.
It's classified.

401
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,838
Forty thousand of these old wrecks in
the air, and that's all they give us.

402
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,299
Well, I'm not about to have any surprises
on a routine check.

403
00:27:56,383 --> 00:27:59,803
We run into these two,
we shoot first.

404
00:27:59,969 --> 00:28:02,639
Brass can sort it out later.

405
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:07,018
So what was it?
Open the stash, pull out the goods.

406
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,145
What? I just got done putting it in.

407
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:11,022
Yeah. And now I'm telling you take
it all out again.

408
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:13,191
Why for?
I got no notion to argue this.

409
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:17,028
In about two minutes, this boat's gonna be
crawling with Alliance.

410
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:18,947
No.

411
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:22,325
We've gotta run.

412
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:23,827
Can't run. They're pulling us in.

413
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,913
If they find us, they'll
send River back to that place.

414
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:29,916
To be tortured.
I'd never see her again.

415
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:31,960
Stack everything in plain sight.

416
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:33,670
Wouldn't want it to seem like
we got anything to hide.

417
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:36,756
Might give them Alliance boys
the wrong impression.

418
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,174
Or the right one.
That too.

419
00:28:38,258 --> 00:28:42,053
Now, go fetch your sister.
What?

420
00:28:46,182 --> 00:28:48,184
Why? Are you gonna put her
in plain sight too?

421
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:50,812
Don't get touchy.
Just do as I say.

422
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:54,023
Is that why you let us stay, so you could
use us as bargaining chips?

423
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:57,402
Knew there was a reason.
You are not giving her to them.

424
00:28:57,694 --> 00:28:59,320
Don't be a fool, son.

425
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,741
Do as the man says.

426
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:25,764
Well,
quite a lot of fuss.

427
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:29,476
If I didn't know better,
I'd think we were dangerous.

428
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:32,771
Is this your vessel?

429
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,940
It is. Bought and paid for.
I'm Captain Malcolm Reynolds.

430
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:39,110
And is this everyone, Captain?
By way of crew, it is.

431
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,363
Though in our infirmary you're gonna find
a fella we rescued off that derelict.

432
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:44,032
Saved him,
guess you could say.

433
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,868
Mmm.

434
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,162
Straight to the back,
next to the common area.

435
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:53,291
And these items,
you rescued them as well?

436
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:05,970
MAN: (cackling)

437
00:30:08,264 --> 00:30:10,391
Looks to me like
an illegal salvage operation.

438
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,186
It does?
That's discouraging.

439
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,688
Alliance property too.
You could lose your ship Caprain.

440
00:30:16,064 --> 00:30:19,359
But that is a wrist slap compared to
the penalty for harboring fugitives.

441
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:23,029
A brother and sister. When I search this
vessel, I won't find them, will I?

442
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:24,948
No children on this boat.

443
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:28,076
Mmm.
I didn't say children.

444
00:30:28,076 --> 00:30:31,204
Siblings.
Adult siblings.

445
00:30:31,621 --> 00:30:33,748
I misunderstood.
Mmm.

446
00:30:36,626 --> 00:30:39,045
No chance
they could have stowed away?

447
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:41,005
No one would blame you
for that, Captain.

448
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:43,216
I know how these older-model Fireflies

449
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:45,510
tend to have those troublesome little
nooks.

450
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:47,345
Do they?

451
00:30:47,428 --> 00:30:51,808
Smugglers and the like tend to prefer them
just for that reason.

452
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:56,312
(whispering)

453
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:06,114
We will continue this conversation
in a more official capacity.

454
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:08,241
I want every inch
of this junker tossed.

455
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:10,910
"Junker"?
Settle down, Kaylee.

456
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,205
But, Captain, did you hear what that
purple-belly called Serenity?

457
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,082
MAL: Shut up!

458
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,628
MAN: Get him outta here.

459
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:37,478
COMMANDER: You are a Companion.
INARA: Yes.

460
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,731
And you were based for years
on Sihnon.

461
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:43,318
It's only in the last year that you've
been shipping out with The Serenity?

462
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,278
It's just Serenity,
and that's correct.

463
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,781
In a few weeks it will be a year.

464
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,241
Why is this important?

465
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,910
I'm just trying to put the
pieces together.

466
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,746
It's a, uh-- It's a curiosity,

467
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,831
a woman of stature such as yourself...

468
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:59,792
falling in with... these types.

469
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:04,213
Not in the least. It's a mutually
beneficial business arrangement.

470
00:32:04,213 --> 00:32:08,051
I rent the shuttle from Capt. Reynolds,
which allows me to expand my client base,

471
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:11,971
and the captain finds that
having a Companion on board...

472
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:15,058
opens certain doors that might otherwise
be closed to him.

473
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:18,770
And do you love him?
I don't see how that's relevant.

474
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,980
Well, he is your husband.
Yes.

475
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:24,692
You two met
through Capt. Reynolds?

476
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:27,362
Captain was looking for a pilot.
I found a husband.

477
00:32:27,362 --> 00:32:29,364
Seemed to work out.

478
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:32,325
You fought with Reynolds in the war?
Fought with a lot of people in a war.

479
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:34,661
And your husband.
Fight with him sometimes too.

480
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:39,999
Is there any particular reason you don't
wish to discuss your marriage?

481
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,711
Don't see that it's
any of your business is all.

482
00:32:44,128 --> 00:32:45,505
We're very private people.

483
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,048
WASH:
The legs.

484
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:50,134
(chuckling) Oh, yeah. Definitely have to
say it was her legs.

485
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,762
You can put that down.

486
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:57,350
Her legs, and right where her legs meet
her back. Actually, that whole area.

487
00:32:58,017 --> 00:32:59,852
That, and above it.

488
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:04,399
Six gerstlers crammed
under every cooling drive...

489
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:06,776
so that you strain
your primary artery function,

490
00:33:06,859 --> 00:33:10,697
and you end up having to recycle secondary
exhaust through a bypass system...

491
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,032
just so's you don't end up pumping it
through the main atmofeed...

492
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,827
and asphyxiating the entire crew.

493
00:33:16,285 --> 00:33:17,745
Now, that's junk.

494
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:20,456
Have you seen what she wears?
Forget about it.

495
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,917
Have you ever been
with a warrior woman?

496
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:41,060
Pirates. Pirates with
their own chaplain.

497
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:43,938
There's an oddity.

498
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:46,858
Not the only oddity this end of space,
Commander,

499
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,403
where things aren't always so plain
as on the central planets.

500
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:53,239
Rules can be a mite fuzzier.

501
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:57,076
These fugitives that we're looking for--
the brother and the sister.

502
00:33:57,535 --> 00:34:00,913
They were last seen on Persephone.
That a fact?

503
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:03,958
They also left port aboard
a Firefly-class transport,

504
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:07,003
just about the same time that you
shipped out with Serenity.

505
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,423
Well, Persephone's
a big place.

506
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:14,260
Yes. Yes, it is.
And that Firefly isn't.

507
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:16,846
And if anyone's hiding
anywhere on it,

508
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:19,140
we will find them.

509
00:35:41,931 --> 00:35:45,226
So, I figure by now you been over to the
derelict, seen for yourself.

510
00:35:45,643 --> 00:35:47,728
Yes.
Terrible thing.

511
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:52,733
If you want my advice,
you won't tow it back.

512
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:56,154
Just fire the whole gorram thing from
space, be done with it.

513
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:59,740
That ship is evidence. I'm not in the
habit of destroying evidence.

514
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:02,118
Course not.
Be against the rules.

515
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:06,164
I'm gonna make a leap here...

516
00:36:06,247 --> 00:36:08,583
and figure this is your first tour out
here on the border. (sniffs)

517
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,629
It's a very loyal crew
you have there.

518
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,716
But then,
I can tell by your record...

519
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:21,971
you have a--a tendency to inspire that
quality in people... Sergeant.

520
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,893
It's not sergeant. Not anymore.
War's over.

521
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,729
For some,
the war'll never be over.

522
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:31,731
I notice your ship's
called Serenity.

523
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,108
You were stationed on Hara
at the end of the war.

524
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:38,029
Battle of Serenity Valley took place
there, if I recall.

525
00:36:38,487 --> 00:36:40,114
You know I believe
you might be right.

526
00:36:40,489 --> 00:36:42,408
Independents suffered
a pretty crushing defeat there.

527
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:45,161
Some say that after Serenity
the browncoats were through,

528
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,997
that the war ended
in that valley.

529
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:49,248
Hmm.

530
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:53,085
Seems odd you'd name your ship after a
battle you were on the wrong side of.

531
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:57,548
May have been the losing side.
Still not convinced it was the wrong one.

532
00:37:01,469 --> 00:37:03,221
Is that why you attacked
that transport?

533
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:04,430
What?

534
00:37:04,513 --> 00:37:06,515
You're still fighting the same
battle, Sergeant.

535
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:08,309
Only those weren't soldiers
you murdered.

536
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:11,020
They were civilians, families,
citizens loyal to the Alliance,

537
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:13,648
trying to make a new life, and you just
can't stand that, can you?

538
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:17,610
So we attacked that ship, then brought the
only living survivor to our infirmary.

539
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,403
Is that what we did?

540
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:20,780
I'd ask him,

541
00:37:21,447 --> 00:37:25,076
only I'm not sure he'll be able to speak
with his tongue split down the middle.

542
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:26,827
(mutters in Chinese)

543
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:31,082
I haven't seen
that kind of torture since--

544
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,584
well, since the war.

545
00:37:33,584 --> 00:37:34,418
I should have known.

546
00:37:34,502 --> 00:37:35,753
You and your crew
are bound by law.

547
00:37:35,836 --> 00:37:38,005
Formal charges will be transmitted
to central authority.

548
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:41,968
Commander, I'm not what you need to be
concerned about right now.

549
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,303
Things go the way they are,
there's gonna be blood.

550
00:37:45,304 --> 00:37:48,724
Get him down! Let's start the pressure.
(nurses, attendants shouting)

551
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:51,978
Get a line in.
Go.

552
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:54,981
All right.
Come on, go.

553
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:57,984
(screams)

554
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,031
Reavers?

555
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:06,492
That is what I said.

556
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:10,538
You can't imagine how many times
men in my position hear that excuse--

557
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:12,081
Reavers did it.

558
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:15,084
It's the truth.
You saw them, did you?

559
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,961
Wouldn't be sittin' here talkin' to you
if I had.

560
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,713
No, of course not.

561
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:22,967
But I'll tell you who did--
that poor bastard you took off my ship.

562
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,761
He looked right into the face of it
and was made to stare.

563
00:38:25,761 --> 00:38:27,805
It.
The darkness.

564
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:32,143
The kind of darkness
you can't even imagine.

565
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,937
Blacker than the space
it moves through.

566
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:36,314
Very poetic.

567
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,984
They made him watch.

568
00:38:40,151 --> 00:38:42,862
He probably tried to turn away.
They wouldn't let him.

569
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,698
You call him a survivor.
He's not.

570
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:50,161
A man comes up against
that kind of will,

571
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:54,999
the only way to deal with it,
I suspect, is to become it.

572
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:58,794
He's following the only course
left to him.

573
00:39:00,671 --> 00:39:03,966
First he'll try to
make himself look like one.

574
00:39:03,966 --> 00:39:06,010
Cut on himself,
desecrate his flesh.

575
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:08,637
And then...
he'll start actin' like one.

576
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:12,767
(beep)
(sniffs)

577
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:18,814
Let's have two M.P.s up here to escort
Sergeant Reynolds to the brig.

578
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,578
Let's go again.

579
00:39:33,704 --> 00:39:36,540
Later... maybe.

580
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,126
The captain said
once the coast is clear,

581
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:41,170
we should lay low
in the shuttle.

582
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,422
Come on.
Coming back.

583
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,843
Yes. Yes, of course he is.
They all are.

584
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:51,889
Your ship and its contents
will be auctioned.

585
00:39:51,972 --> 00:39:54,975
The proceeds of the sale will be applied
to the cost of your defense.

586
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,895
(whispering)

587
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,398
Get him out of here.

588
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:03,150
Go to full lockdown.
I want guards on the nursery.

589
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:07,863
It won't matter. You won't find him.
But I know where he'll go.

590
00:40:13,202 --> 00:40:15,246
Wait, no.
Don't. Don't.

591
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:17,039
River, it's okay.

592
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:19,375
Wait. Wait... here.

593
00:40:19,458 --> 00:40:21,919
They've gone.
Come on.

594
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,088
Don't-- (whimpers)
River, it's okay.

595
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,048
No.

596
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:28,092
Come on.
No.

597
00:40:28,175 --> 00:40:30,386
Don't--
(whimpers)

598
00:40:30,469 --> 00:40:32,096
River you don't have to
be afraid.

599
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,978
Why would he
come back here?

600
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:41,939
Looking for familiar ground.
He's on the hunt.

601
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:45,776
All right,
let's get him to the brig.

602
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:49,071
No, no, no. I should go with you.
That's out of the question.

603
00:40:49,155 --> 00:40:51,907
How many more men you feel like
losing today, Commander?

604
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:55,911
Nobody knows Serenity like I do.
I can help you.

605
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,623
We let him go first.

606
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:02,751
Right.

607
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,045
You want to, uh--

608
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:22,688
Thanks. Now I'll really
have the advantage.

609
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:43,125
We don't know how long it's going to be.
I don't think we should move around much.

610
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:45,127
I'm just gonna grab
some food--

611
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:50,174
(whimpering softly)
Someone's coming.

612
00:42:47,481 --> 00:42:49,733
(screams)
(soldier groans)

613
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,444
(grunting, yelling)

614
00:43:02,955 --> 00:43:04,164
(neck snaps)

615
00:43:11,297 --> 00:43:13,090
(panting)

616
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:26,103
You save his gorram life.
He still takes the cargo.

617
00:43:26,645 --> 00:43:28,439
(speaks Chinese)

618
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:31,775
He had to.
Couldn't let us profit.

619
00:43:32,776 --> 00:43:34,445
Wouldn't be civilized.

620
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:24,536
Grr! Arrgh!
