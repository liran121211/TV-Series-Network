00:00:04,038 --> 00:00:04,905
>> [laughs]

2
00:00:04,905 --> 00:00:06,774
HI, I'M BRIANA.

3
00:00:06,774 --> 00:00:08,142
I WAS BORN IN BROOKLYN,

4
00:00:08,142 --> 00:00:09,643
NEW YORK, AND THEN MOVED TO

5
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:11,812
ORLANDO, FLORIDA WHEN I WAS TEN

6
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:14,082
WITH MY MOM, OLDER SISTER, AND

7
00:00:14,082 --> 00:00:14,915
OUR DOG, PRINCE.

8
00:00:14,915 --> 00:00:16,484
>> HI, PRINCE.

9
00:00:16,484 --> 00:00:17,718
>> I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD

10
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:18,386
STUDENT.

11
00:00:18,386 --> 00:00:19,853
I EVEN GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL

12
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:21,655
A YEAR AHEAD OF MY CLASS.

13
00:00:21,655 --> 00:00:23,023
I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO

14
00:00:23,023 --> 00:00:24,758
STARTING COLLEGE IN THE FALL.

15
00:00:24,758 --> 00:00:26,294
I REALLY LIKE HANGING OUT WITH

16
00:00:26,294 --> 00:00:27,861
MY FRIENDS AND TAKING PICTURES.

17
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,097
[shutter clicks]

18
00:00:29,097 --> 00:00:30,631
MY DAD WASN'T AROUND MUCH

19
00:00:30,631 --> 00:00:32,166
GROWING UP, BUT MY MOM HAS

20
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,634
WORKED HARD TO TAKE CARE OF ME

21
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:34,402
AND MY SISTER.

22
00:00:34,402 --> 00:00:35,669
>> I THINK YOU CAN DO COLLEGE,

23
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:37,138
AND THEN FROM THERE YOU DECIDE

24
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:38,472
WHAT YOU WANT TO BECOME.

25
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:39,540
>> THE THREE OF US ARE REALLY

26
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,274
CLOSE.

27
00:00:40,274 --> 00:00:41,909
WE TALK ABOUT EVERYTHING.

28
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:43,111
>> SHUT UP!

29
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:44,212
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT YOU'RE

30
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:44,945
TALKING ABOUT.

31
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:45,913
>> MY BOYFRIEND DEVOIN AND I

32
00:00:45,913 --> 00:00:47,481
BROKE UP A MONTH AGO, BUT I

33
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:48,849
STILL LOVE HIM AND HOPE WE CAN

34
00:00:48,849 --> 00:00:50,418
WORK THINGS OUT, BECAUSE...

35
00:00:50,418 --> 00:00:51,119
[chime dings]

36
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:52,953
I'M PREGNANT.

37
00:01:00,294 --> 00:01:01,695
TELLING MY MOM I WAS PREGNANT

38
00:01:01,695 --> 00:01:03,364
WAS PRETTY SCARY, ESPECIALLY

39
00:01:03,364 --> 00:01:04,698
SINCE MY OLDER SISTER, BRITTANY,

40
00:01:04,698 --> 00:01:05,933
FOUND OUT SHE WAS PREGNANT

41
00:01:05,933 --> 00:01:07,668
AROUND THE SAME TIME, BUT WE

42
00:01:07,668 --> 00:01:08,869
BOTH MADE VERY DIFFERENT

43
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:10,304
CHOICES.

44
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:11,372
BRITTANY'S BOYFRIEND AT THE TIME

45
00:01:11,372 --> 00:01:13,374
WAS NOT SUPPORTIVE, SO SHE

46
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:15,543
DECIDED TO HAVE AN ABORTION.

47
00:01:15,543 --> 00:01:16,677
AT THE TIME WHEN I MADE MY

48
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:18,879
DECISION, MY BOYFRIEND DEVOIN

49
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:21,014
AND I WERE STILL TOGETHER, SO I

50
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:23,151
DECIDED TO KEEP MY BABY, BUT I'M

51
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:24,452
STILL QUESTIONING IF I MADE THE

52
00:01:24,452 --> 00:01:26,320
RIGHT DECISION.

53
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,621
I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL HER IN

54
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:28,389
PERSON.

55
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:29,357
LIKE, "OH, MY GOD, MOM, I'M

56
00:01:29,357 --> 00:01:30,023
PREGNANT."

57
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:30,958
>> LIKE, IT'S ONE OF THOSE

58
00:01:30,958 --> 00:01:32,059
THINGS WHEN YOU LIKE A BOY, AND

59
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:33,161
YOU'RE LIKE, IN A TEXT MESSAGE,

60
00:01:33,161 --> 00:01:34,128
"I LIKE YOU," OR IN A NOTE,

61
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:35,129
"I LIKE YOU. CHECK YES OR NO."

62
00:01:35,129 --> 00:01:35,863
SO IT'S LIKE--

63
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:36,864
>> YEAH, I WASN'T GONNA TELL

64
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:37,631
HER TO HER FACE.

65
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:38,432
I COULDN'T DO THAT.

66
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,300
SO I WROTE HER LETTER.

67
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,268
>> I WAS SITTING ON THE SOFA,

68
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:42,436
AND SHE PASSED ME THE LETTER.

69
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,404
I GRABBED THE LETTER, AND I

70
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:44,104
KNEW.

71
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:46,440
MY HEART JUST SANK.

72
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,976
AND I OPEN IT, AND SHE SAID--

73
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:49,610
>> WHOO.

74
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,411
>> SHE'S PREGNANT,

75
00:01:50,411 --> 00:01:51,212
THAT SHE'S SORRY.

76
00:01:51,212 --> 00:01:52,246
YADA, YADA, YADA.

77
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:54,114
I GOT NAUSEOUS; I GOT DIZZY.

78
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:56,650
>> I PRAYED, HONEY.

79
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,518
I PRAYED AND I PRAYED.

80
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:58,619
>> I JUST KEPT SAYING, "SORRY."

81
00:01:58,619 --> 00:01:59,620
>> I WAS TALKING ON THE PHONE,

82
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:00,588
AND THEN I HEAR "BOOM, BOOM,

83
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:01,189
BOOM."

84
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:01,889
I GOT SCARED.

85
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:02,890
I WAS LIKE, "WHAT THE HELL IS

86
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:03,524
GOIN' ON?"

87
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:04,558
>> I DIDN'T WANT HER TO HAVE IT.

88
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:05,326
I WAS DETERMINED.

89
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:06,327
I DID NOT WANT BRIANA TO HAVE

90
00:02:06,327 --> 00:02:06,760
THE BABY.

91
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,964
>> I DIDN'T WANT TO.

92
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,700
>> IT JUST FEELS LIKE I FAILED.

93
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,202
I COME FROM BROOKLYN, A VERY

94
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:15,603
TOUGH PART OF IT.

95
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:17,571
I BRING YOU GUYS HERE, AND

96
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:19,673
SOMETIMES I QUESTION, WAS IT THE

97
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:22,310
RIGHT THING OR NOT, BUT I HAVE

98
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,745
DOUBTS NOW.

99
00:02:24,745 --> 00:02:25,846
IT'S GONNA BE HARD, BRI,

100
00:02:25,846 --> 00:02:27,448
SERIOUSLY.

101
00:02:27,448 --> 00:02:29,450
>> I KNOW.

102
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,485
BEING A TEEN MOM WILL BE A HUGE

103
00:02:31,485 --> 00:02:33,387
CHALLENGE, SO I REALLY NEED TO

104
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:34,655
FIGURE STUFF OUT WITH DEVOIN

105
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,324
SOON.

106
00:02:36,324 --> 00:02:38,326
THE TIMING SUCKS, 'CAUSE I GOT

107
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:40,461
TO GIVE BIRTH IN FIVE WEEKS.

108
00:02:40,461 --> 00:02:41,195
>> IT'S WEIRD.

109
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:42,263
LIKE, I CAN'T PICTURE YOU HAVING

110
00:02:42,263 --> 00:02:43,063
THE BABY, YOU KNOW?

111
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:44,265
>> IT DIDN'T HIT ME YET.

112
00:02:44,265 --> 00:02:45,699
>> HOW DID THIS ALL HAPPEN?

113
00:02:45,699 --> 00:02:48,068
>> WE DIDN'T USE PROTECTION.

114
00:02:48,068 --> 00:02:49,036
>> BUT YOU GUYS NEVER USED

115
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:50,204
PROTECTION?

116
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:51,672
>> ONCE OR TWICE.

117
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:52,873
I DIDN'T SAY, "PUT ON A

118
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:53,574
SOMETHIN'."

119
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:55,075
THAT'S JUST AWKWARD AND WEIRD TO

120
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:55,909
ME, I THINK.

121
00:02:55,909 --> 00:02:57,010
>> IF YOU FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH

122
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,111
THAT PERSON, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO

123
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:58,812
JUST ASK.

124
00:02:58,812 --> 00:02:59,880
>> HE SHOULD'VE ASKED.

125
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,449
HE SHOULD'VE DID IT ANYWAYS.

126
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:02,483
>> YOU WEREN'T SCARED--"OH, MY

127
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:03,684
GOD, I MIGHT GET PREGNANT"?

128
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:04,752
>> I DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING WOULD

129
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:06,019
HAPPEN.

130
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,721
AND THEN IT HAPPENED.

131
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:08,989
I JUST THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE A

132
00:03:08,989 --> 00:03:09,990
SCHOOL RELATIONSHIP.

133
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,592
ONCE HE GRADUATED, IT WAS GONNA

134
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:13,827
BE OVER, BUT IT WENT FARTHER

135
00:03:13,827 --> 00:03:15,829
THAN THAT.

136
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:22,069
SINCE DEVOIN AND I ARE NOT

137
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:24,104
TOGETHER, RAISING A BABY ON MY

138
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:25,973
OWN IS GONNA BE REALLY TOUGH,

139
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:27,275
AND SOMETIMES I WONDER IF I

140
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:28,576
SHOULD HAVE DONE WHAT MY SISTER

141
00:03:28,576 --> 00:03:29,610
DID.

142
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,245
SHE PUTS UP A GOOD FRONT, BUT

143
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:32,813
UNDERNEATH, I STILL THINK SHE'S

144
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,014
STRUGGLING WITH HER DECISION

145
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:34,982
TOO.

146
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:36,484
WERE YOU SCARED TO TELL HER,

147
00:03:36,484 --> 00:03:37,718
'CAUSE MOM KNEW I WAS PREGNANT

148
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:38,486
FIRST?

149
00:03:38,486 --> 00:03:39,487
>> YEAH.

150
00:03:39,487 --> 00:03:40,754
WHEN I FINALLY DID TELL HER, YOU

151
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:41,855
COULD THE DISAPPOINT ON HER

152
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:42,556
FACE.

153
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,024
>> SHE DIDN'T GO DOWN YOUR

154
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,158
THROAT THE WAY SHE WENT DOWN MY

155
00:03:45,158 --> 00:03:45,859
THROAT.

156
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:46,960
>> BECAUSE, IF YOU REALLY THINK

157
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,928
ABOUT IT, THE SHOCK ALREADY

158
00:03:47,928 --> 00:03:48,896
SLAPPED HER IN THE FACE WITH

159
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:49,963
YOU, AND THEN I WAS, LIKE,

160
00:03:49,963 --> 00:03:50,731
WORRIED ABOUT ME.

161
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:51,832
>> AND THEN I FOUND OUT YOU WAS

162
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:52,466
PREGNANT.

163
00:03:52,466 --> 00:03:53,334
I WAS KIND OF SHOCKED.

164
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:54,335
THEN YOU SAY YOU WANTED TO GET

165
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:55,336
AN ABORTION, AND I WAS LIKE,

166
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:56,236
"YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT.

167
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:57,004
SO DON'T DO IT."

168
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:58,038
>> I FEEL LIKE THE ABORTION WAS,

169
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,073
LIKE, WHAT I HAD TO DO.

170
00:04:00,073 --> 00:04:01,241
I WAS THINKING ABOUT, "WHEN MY

171
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,710
SISTER--WHEN SHE HAS TO THINK

172
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:03,811
ABOUT HOW TO PAY FOR DIAPERS AND

173
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:04,778
STUFF, I DON'T HAVE TO THINK

174
00:04:04,778 --> 00:04:05,746
ABOUT PAYING FOR DIAPERS.

175
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,080
WHEN BRIANA'S THINKING ABOUT,

176
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,617
'OH, DEVOIN'S OVER HERE MESSING

177
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:10,784
AROUND WITH HER AND STUFF', AND

178
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:11,819
SHE HAS TO TAKE CARE OF THE BABY

179
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,554
BY HERSELF, I'M NOT DOING THAT."

180
00:04:13,554 --> 00:04:14,988
YOU'RE GONNA SEE ME DOING--GOING

181
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:16,089
OUT, DRIVING, HAVING FUN, AND

182
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,090
YOU'RE GONNA BE STUCK AT HOME

183
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:17,925
WITH A BABY.

184
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:20,060
>> MM-HMM.

185
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,128
YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT

186
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:24,231
WHAT I HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT.

187
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:26,700
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

188
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,536
>> MY DUE DATE IS A MONTH AWAY,

189
00:04:28,536 --> 00:04:30,037
AND DEVOIN STILL HASN'T BEEN IN

190
00:04:30,037 --> 00:04:31,872
TOUCH.

191
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:33,040
BRITTANY HAS BEEN HANGING AROUND

192
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,975
THE HOUSE LESS AND LESS, SO IT

193
00:04:34,975 --> 00:04:36,477
WAS UP TO MY MOM AND ME TO TAKE

194
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:37,911
CARE OF ALL THE STUFF LEFT TO DO

195
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:38,812
FOR THE BABY.

196
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,414
LOOK, MOM, THAT'S TWO.

197
00:04:40,414 --> 00:04:41,114
YOU SEE TWO?

198
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,217
THIS IS TWO.

199
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,186
THAT IS DUSTY.

200
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:46,987
>> OH, MY GOD.

201
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:48,989
WE GOT IT.

202
00:04:48,989 --> 00:04:49,957
[gasps]

203
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:51,859
OH, MY GOD, WE DID IT.

204
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:54,094
JEEZ, LOUISE, WE DID IT!

205
00:04:54,094 --> 00:04:55,195
WHAT IS THIS?

206
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:56,397
>> WE DID IT THE WRONG WAY.

207
00:04:56,397 --> 00:04:57,197
>> WHO'S BLEEDING?

208
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:58,599
>> [gasps] I'M BLEEDING.

209
00:04:58,599 --> 00:05:00,401
>> YOU ARE.

210
00:05:00,401 --> 00:05:01,234
>> OH, MY GOD, BRI.

211
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,169
>> FROM WHERE?

212
00:05:02,169 --> 00:05:03,937
>> YOU'RE FEET.

213
00:05:03,937 --> 00:05:05,439
DON'T TOUCH ANYTHING.

214
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:06,640
PUT YOUR FOOT IN THE PLASTIC.

215
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,641
STAY THERE.

216
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,242
OH, MY GOD.

217
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:10,310
>> HOW'D THAT HAPPEN?

218
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,078
>> JEEZ, LOUISE.

219
00:05:11,078 --> 00:05:11,745
>> [laughs]

220
00:05:11,745 --> 00:05:13,381
>> RIGHT IN YOUR FOOT?

221
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:14,448
>> OH, MY GOD.

222
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:17,451
>> BRIT!

223
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:18,852
LOOK AT THE MASSACRE THAT WE

224
00:05:18,852 --> 00:05:20,854
HAVE--THAT HAPPENED.

225
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:22,155
>> CAN YOU IMAGINE IN LABOR, AND

226
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,691
ALL THAT BLOOD COMING OUT?

227
00:05:23,691 --> 00:05:25,493
>> THAT IS DISGUSTING.

228
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:26,427
>> THAT'S GONNA DRIP.

229
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:27,495
WAIT!

230
00:05:27,495 --> 00:05:28,929
IF YOU DRIP BLOOD ALL OVER

231
00:05:28,929 --> 00:05:29,930
THE PLACE, I'M GONNA GET YOU.

232
00:05:29,930 --> 00:05:31,732
OKAY.

233
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:35,335
>> NO, WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IS

234
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,470
LEARN HOW TO DO THIS, BECAUSE

235
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,171
WHEN YOUR BABY SPITS, YOU'RE

236
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,440
GONNA BE DOING THE SAME THING.

237
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:41,108
>> WHEN SHE DOO-DOOS, AND IT

238
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:42,109
LEAKS OUT OF HER DIAPER, I'M

239
00:05:42,109 --> 00:05:43,210
SURE NOT GONNA BE THE ONE TO BE

240
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:44,077
CLEANING THAT MESS UP.

241
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,178
I DON'T CARE IF I'M BABYSITTING

242
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:45,713
HER.

243
00:05:45,713 --> 00:05:46,714
>> EW, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE

244
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:47,648
CLEANING [bleep] DIAPERS.

245
00:05:47,648 --> 00:05:48,616
>> IF I BABYSIT HER ONE DAY,

246
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:49,583
IT'S GONNA STAY THERE ON THE

247
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:50,684
FLOOR UNTIL YOU GUYS COME HOME,

248
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:51,685
'CAUSE I AIN'T TOUCHIN' THAT.

249
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:52,886
I'LL BE LIVING THE HIGH LIFE IN

250
00:05:52,886 --> 00:05:55,222
MY CONVERTIBLE MUSTANG.

251
00:05:55,222 --> 00:05:55,923
>> WHATEVER.

252
00:05:55,923 --> 00:05:57,791
>> I WANT YOU TO LIVE YOUR LIFE.

253
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:59,192
I WANT YOU TO DO YOUR THING.

254
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:00,994
I WANT YOU TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND

255
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,463
ACCOMPLISH EVERYTHING THAT YOU

256
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:05,065
KNOW YOU CAN, AND I WANT HER TO

257
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:05,799
DO THE SAME.

258
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:06,934
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT BOTH OF

259
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:08,469
YOUS WOULD BOTH JUST BE OUT, AND

260
00:06:08,469 --> 00:06:10,370
DO YOUR THINGS, AND NOW IT FEELS

261
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,205
LIKE YOU GET TO DO IT ALL, AND

262
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:13,073
SHE CAN'T.

263
00:06:13,073 --> 00:06:14,174
>> WELL, THAT'S THE CHOICES THAT

264
00:06:14,174 --> 00:06:14,942
WE MADE.

265
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:17,177
I NEVER SAID THAT I'M GONNA NOT

266
00:06:17,177 --> 00:06:17,878
DO ANYTHING.

267
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,012
I CAN STILL LIVE MY LIFE.

268
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:19,913
I JUST HAVE TO LIVE IT A

269
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:20,814
DIFFERENT WAY.

270
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:22,282
>> WHEN I WENT AND I GOT MY

271
00:06:22,282 --> 00:06:24,585
ABORTION, THEN I KNEW WHAT I WAS

272
00:06:24,585 --> 00:06:25,819
GOING FOR.

273
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,254
AND I KNEW THAT BRIANA WAS GONNA

274
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:28,388
HAVE HERS, AND I WAS GONNA HAVE

275
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,123
TO SEE A BABY IN THE HOUSE.

276
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,925
>> YOU DECIDED TO DO WHAT YOU

277
00:06:31,925 --> 00:06:33,226
THOUGHT WAS RIGHT AND WHAT WAS

278
00:06:33,226 --> 00:06:34,127
RIGHT FOR BRIANA, AND--

279
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:35,162
>> SOME DAYS I WISH I COULD TAKE

280
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:36,396
IT BACK, BUT I CAN'T GO BACK

281
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:38,599
NOW.

282
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:40,968
>> I KNOW THAT THAT HURTS YOU.

283
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:42,235
AND I'M SORRY THAT YOU HAD TO GO

284
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:43,704
THROUGH THAT.

285
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:44,705
AND I'M SORRY THAT YOU HAVE TO

286
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:50,110
STAY HERE AND WATCH HER HAVE HER

287
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,481
BABY, AND YOU CAN'T.

288
00:06:53,481 --> 00:06:57,718
AH, I'M SORRY.

289
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:58,886
>> I'M NOT IN THIS HOUSE BECAUSE

290
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:00,588
I DON'T WANT TO--LIKE, NOT TO BE

291
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:02,155
RUDE, BUT I DON'T WANT TO SEE

292
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,625
YOU PREGNANT OR SEE MOM BUYING

293
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,860
STUFF FOR ANOTHER BABY.

294
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,795
>> I DON'T WANT YOU TO GET

295
00:07:07,795 --> 00:07:10,464
DEPRESSED, OR I DON'T WANT YOU

296
00:07:10,464 --> 00:07:12,099
TO GET MAD AND TAKE IT OUT ON ME

297
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,835
OR SOMETHING.

298
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:28,315
>> IT'S AWKWARD HAVING SO MUCH

299
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,550
TENSION AROUND THE HOUSE WITH

300
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,784
BRITTANY SINCE SHE'S STILL

301
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:31,919
STRUGGLING WITH THE FACT THAT

302
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:33,320
I'M HAVING A BABY, AND SHE'S

303
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:34,154
NOT.

304
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:36,023
AND ON TOP OF THAT, IT'S BEEN A

305
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:38,225
MONTH SINCE DEVOIN AND I SPOKE.

306
00:07:38,225 --> 00:07:39,493
HE HASN'T SHOWN ANY INTEREST IN

307
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:41,529
MY PREGNANCY SO FAR, BUT I'M

308
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:42,830
HOPING HE STILL WANTS TO BE A

309
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,164
PART OF THE BABY'S LIFE.

310
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,899
I EXPECT HIM TO BE THERE.

311
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,000
HE HASN'T BEEN THERE.

312
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:47,968
I WANT HIM TO BE LIKE, "YOU

313
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,469
KNOW WHAT, BRIANA, I'M GONNA GO

314
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,504
TO THE DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT WITH

315
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:51,071
YOU."

316
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:52,372
NO, HE DOESN'T DO THAT.

317
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:53,340
>> AND WHEN THE BABY'S BORN,

318
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:54,341
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM HIM?

319
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:55,876
>> TO BE THERE FOR HER.

320
00:07:55,876 --> 00:07:57,010
I WANT HIM TO WAKE UP IN THE

321
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:58,045
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND DO

322
00:07:58,045 --> 00:07:59,379
EVERYTHING I HAVE TO DO.

323
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:00,313
I DON'T WANT HIM TO GO TO

324
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:02,215
BED--TO GO HOME TO HIS HOUSE AND

325
00:08:02,215 --> 00:08:03,383
SLEEP THE WHOLE NIGHT.

326
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:04,451
>> HE CAN SPEND A FEW NIGHTS A

327
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:05,152
WEEK.

328
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:07,020
I'M NOT SAYING NO.

329
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:08,822
BUT I'M ALSO NOT GONNA MAKE MY

330
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,190
HOME A HOTEL FOR HIM.

331
00:08:10,190 --> 00:08:10,958
>> I KNOW.

332
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,560
>> NO WAY.

333
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,027
>> I WANT HIM TO BE THERE FOR

334
00:08:14,027 --> 00:08:15,262
HIS DAUGHTER, TO BE THERE FOR

335
00:08:15,262 --> 00:08:18,766
HIS FAMILY, TO NOT BE SO...

336
00:08:18,766 --> 00:08:19,466
>> LAZY?

337
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:20,901
>> CHILL AND LAID-BACK, LIKE

338
00:08:20,901 --> 00:08:23,436
EVERYTHING--I DON'T KNOW.

339
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:24,872
IT'S SO DIFFICULT.

340
00:08:24,872 --> 00:08:27,575
>> HE'LL GET IT EVENTUALLY.

341
00:08:27,575 --> 00:08:28,609
>> I'VE BEEN TEXTING DEVOIN

342
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:30,310
ABOUT MEETING UP TO TALK, BUT HE

343
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:31,945
HASN'T RESPONDED YET.

344
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:34,147
I GRADUATED EARLY, AND I WAS

345
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,348
PLANNING ON STARTING COLLEGE IN

346
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,017
THE FALL, BUT IF DEVOIN ISN'T

347
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,351
GOING TO BE AROUND TO HELP ME

348
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,020
WITH THE BABY, I'M NOT SURE I'LL

349
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,288
BE ABLE TO ENROLL AT THE SAME

350
00:08:41,288 --> 00:08:42,656
TIME AS MY FRIENDS.

351
00:08:42,656 --> 00:08:43,591
>> DOES HE WORK AND GO TO

352
00:08:43,591 --> 00:08:44,191
SCHOOL?

353
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,726
LIKE, IS HE ABLE TO...

354
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:46,694
>> SUPPORT YOU FINANCIALLY?

355
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:47,294
>> YEAH.

356
00:08:47,294 --> 00:08:48,829
>> HE GRADUATED HIGH SCHOOL, SO

357
00:08:48,829 --> 00:08:50,297
THAT WILL HELP, BUT HE DOESN'T

358
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:51,164
WORK RIGHT NOW.

359
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:52,199
>> BUT DOES HE HAVE A CAR?

360
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:53,066
HE DOESN'T, DOES HE?

361
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:54,067
>> NO, HE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE A

362
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:54,702
LICENSE.

363
00:08:54,702 --> 00:08:55,435
>> OH, MY GOD.

364
00:08:55,435 --> 00:08:56,436
>> THAT'S WHY OUR RELATIONSHIP

365
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:57,470
HASN'T REALLY WORKED OUT, 'CAUSE

366
00:08:57,470 --> 00:08:58,505
HE'S TOO BUSY, YOU KNOW, HANGING

367
00:08:58,505 --> 00:08:59,640
OUT WITH HIS FRIENDS AND NOT

368
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,507
SPENDING TIME WITH ME.

369
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:01,875
>> YEAH, BUT, LIKE, HE NEEDS TO

370
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,010
LEARN A LITTLE RESPONSIBILITY.

371
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:04,311
HE PROMISED YOU WHEN YOU FOUND

372
00:09:04,311 --> 00:09:05,613
OUT YOU GUYS WERE PREGNANT THAT

373
00:09:05,613 --> 00:09:06,614
HE WAS GONNA TAKE CARE OF YOU

374
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:07,380
AND SUPPORT YOU.

375
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,682
AND THEN, NOW, HE'S NOT DOING

376
00:09:08,682 --> 00:09:09,349
ANYTHING.

377
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:11,151
IF YOU HAD KNOWN THEN THAT HE

378
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,620
WASN'T GONNA BE PROVIDING AND

379
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,921
TAKING CARE OF YOU NOW, WOULD

380
00:09:13,921 --> 00:09:15,756
YOU STILL HAVE KEPT THE BABY?

381
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:17,190
>> I DON'T KNOW.

382
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,926
HE, LIKE, GLAMORIZED THE WHOLE

383
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:19,860
SITUATION.

384
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,261
HE WAS LIKE, "YEAH, WE'RE GONNA

385
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:22,195
DO THIS TOGETHER.

386
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:23,430
I HAVE A JOB.

387
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,965
I'M GONNA TAKE CARE OF HER.

388
00:09:24,965 --> 00:09:26,033
WE'RE GONNA DO THIS AS A

389
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:27,300
FAMILY."

390
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,736
I DID NOT NEED TO GO THROUGH ANY

391
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:31,104
OF THIS, NOT AT ALL.

392
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:37,377
I WAS SUPPOSED TO CHOOSE A BABY

393
00:09:37,377 --> 00:09:38,979
NAME WITH DEVOIN, BUT SINCE HE

394
00:09:38,979 --> 00:09:40,047
HASN'T SHOWN ANY INTEREST

395
00:09:40,047 --> 00:09:41,815
LATELY, AND MY DUE DATE IS ONLY

396
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:43,550
A FEW WEEKS AWAY, I'M GONNA PICK

397
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:44,618
ONE MYSELF.

398
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:46,286
>> WHAT NAME DID YOU HAVE?

399
00:09:46,286 --> 00:09:48,088
>> I LIKE LUNA.

400
00:09:48,088 --> 00:09:49,389
>> LUNA'S NICE.

401
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:50,824
IT'S ACTUALLY BEAUTIFUL.

402
00:09:50,824 --> 00:09:52,926
>> I LIKE NOVA, BLISS.

403
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:54,527
>> BLISS? NO.

404
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:55,595
>> WHY?

405
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,631
>> SOUNDS LIKE A STRIPPER NAME.

406
00:09:57,631 --> 00:09:59,299
>> WHY DOES EVERYBODY SAY THAT?

407
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:00,868
>> BECAUSE IT IS, BRIANA.

408
00:10:00,868 --> 00:10:02,335
YOU HAVE--WHEN YOU THINK OF A

409
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,237
NAME, YOU HAVE TO THINK OF A

410
00:10:04,237 --> 00:10:06,006
NAME FOR THE--ALL THE STAGES OF

411
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:07,107
LIFE.

412
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,842
THE NAME NOVA FITS THE SITUATION

413
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,778
PERFECT: THE BIRTH OF A STAR.

414
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:12,012
THAT IS YOUR BABY, AND THIS IS,

415
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:13,881
LIKE, SOMETHING THAT IS COSMIC,

416
00:10:13,881 --> 00:10:15,182
UNIVERSAL.

417
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:16,549
>> OKAY, THAT'S WHY WE'RE NAMING

418
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:17,184
HER THAT.

419
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:18,118
>> I WANT YOU TO LIKE IT.

420
00:10:18,118 --> 00:10:19,219
IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT, YOU DON'T

421
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:19,953
NAME HER, BRI.

422
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,154
>> I LIKE IT.

423
00:10:21,154 --> 00:10:22,255
>> DON'T PICK IT BECAUSE IT

424
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:24,391
MEANS SOMETHING TO ME--FOR YOU.

425
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:26,559
YOU NAME THE BABY WHAT YOU WANT.

426
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:27,460
>> NOVA.

427
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,963
>> OKAY.

428
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:31,631
>> AFTER DECIDING ON A NAME,

429
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:32,866
IT'S REALLY STARTING TO HIT ME

430
00:10:32,866 --> 00:10:34,201
HOW MUCH MY LIFE IS GOING TO

431
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:36,236
CHANGE, SO I WANT TO SPEND AS

432
00:10:36,236 --> 00:10:37,537
MUCH TIME WITH MY FRIENDS AS I

433
00:10:37,537 --> 00:10:38,171
CAN.

434
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:40,107
>> ARTS AND CRAFTS TIME, BABY.

435
00:10:40,107 --> 00:10:41,241
THESE SHIRTS, RIGHT?

436
00:10:41,241 --> 00:10:42,209
ARE YOU GONNA PUT SOMETHING

437
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:43,443
THAT, LIKE, PEOPLE--YOU FEEL

438
00:10:43,443 --> 00:10:44,411
PEOPLE WILL JUDGE YOU BY?

439
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:45,412
>> WHY DON'T YOU TRY PUTTING,

440
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:46,113
"NOVA" ON IT?

441
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:47,414
>> THAT'S ACTUALLY A GOOD IDEA,

442
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:48,148
BECAUSE, LIKE--

443
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:48,849
>> BABY NOVA.

444
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:49,783
>> LOOKING AT YOU WITH YOUR

445
00:10:49,783 --> 00:10:50,851
DAUGHTER WILL MAKE THEM JUDGE

446
00:10:50,851 --> 00:10:52,686
YOU AUTOMATICALLY.

447
00:10:56,423 --> 00:10:57,424
>> OKAY, SO WHAT DO WE DO NEXT

448
00:10:57,424 --> 00:10:59,426
WITH THIS SHIRT?

449
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:00,393
I DON'T THINK I CAN DO THIS.

450
00:11:00,393 --> 00:11:02,262
THIS IS SCARY.

451
00:11:02,262 --> 00:11:02,930
OH!

452
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:04,031
[laughter]

453
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:05,999
OH, THAT'S COLD!

454
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,101
OH!

455
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:10,570
>> OH, THAT LOOKS SO AWESOME.

456
00:11:10,570 --> 00:11:11,538
>> AH!

457
00:11:11,538 --> 00:11:14,374
[laughter]

458
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,043
>> AH!

459
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:18,111
[screams]

460
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:21,281
[laughter]

461
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:23,150
[chime dings]

462
00:11:26,754 --> 00:11:28,121
>> WHEN I TEXTED DEVOIN ABOUT

463
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:29,957
NAMING OUR BABY, HE ACTUALLY

464
00:11:29,957 --> 00:11:31,358
RESPONDED AND SAID HE WANTED TO

465
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:34,594
MEET UP.

466
00:11:35,996 --> 00:11:37,430
>> I'VE BEEN GETTING THINGS

467
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:40,067
READY FOR OUR DAUGHTER'S

468
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,935
ARRIVAL.

469
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:44,704
>> YEAH.

470
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:47,340
NOVA.

471
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,475
DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE A SAY

472
00:11:48,475 --> 00:11:49,376
IN THE NAME?

473
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,643
>> I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD.

474
00:11:50,643 --> 00:11:52,045
>> IT'S JUST I FEEL THAT YOU

475
00:11:52,045 --> 00:11:53,246
DIDN'T REALLY DO MUCH AND FOR

476
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:55,115
YOU TO HAVE A SAY.

477
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:57,985
>> I DON'T KNOW.

478
00:11:59,152 --> 00:11:59,953
>> IT'S UP TO YOU.

479
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:01,454
IF YOU WANT THE LAST NAME, THEN

480
00:12:01,454 --> 00:12:02,689
YOU SHOW ME THAT YOU WANT THE

481
00:12:02,689 --> 00:12:06,059
LAST NAME.

482
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,560
I THINK A LAST NAME IS MORE

483
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,763
IMPORTANT THAN A FIRST NAME,

484
00:12:09,763 --> 00:12:10,998
'CAUSE WITH THE LAST NAME, YOU

485
00:12:10,998 --> 00:12:11,664
HAVE RIGHTS.

486
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:12,699
WITHOUT THE LAST NAME, YOU DON'T

487
00:12:12,699 --> 00:12:13,400
HAVE [bleep].

488
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,168
>> OVER THIS PAST MONTH, WE

489
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,269
HAVEN'T EVEN SPOKEN TO EACH

490
00:12:16,269 --> 00:12:16,937
OTHER.

491
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:18,571
WE HAVE PERSONAL PROBLEMS.

492
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:21,008
>> I'M JUST ASKING A FEW SIMPLE

493
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:22,142
THINGS FROM YOU.

494
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,577
>> WHAT ARE YOU ASKING FOR?

495
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,179
>> I WANT YOU TO BE THERE AND TO

496
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:27,781
GET A JOB.

497
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:28,982
>> ARE YOU WORRIED I HAVE A JOB

498
00:12:28,982 --> 00:12:30,050
FOR ME, OR ARE YOU WORRIED I

499
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:30,984
HAVE A JOB FOR YOUR SAKE?

500
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:32,719
>> FOR YOU AND HER.

501
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:34,454
I DON'T NEED ANYTHING FROM YOU.

502
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:36,890
WE WERE VERY CLEAR ABOUT THAT.

503
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:37,724
>> MM.

504
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:39,059
>> BUT SHE DOES.

505
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,060
>> WHAT DO YOU NEED PERSONALLY

506
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,995
FROM ME?

507
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:44,431
>> I NEED YOU TO BE THERE.

508
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:47,334
>> DON'T YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO

509
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:49,436
SUPPLY HER WITH THINGS, NOT JUST

510
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:50,203
MY MOM?

511
00:12:50,203 --> 00:12:51,671
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

512
00:12:51,671 --> 00:12:52,672
BUT I CAN'T RIGHT NOW.

513
00:12:52,672 --> 00:12:54,541
YOU COULD. YOU COULD.

514
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,642
YOU COULD.

515
00:12:55,642 --> 00:12:58,345
>> I COULD WHAT?

516
00:12:58,345 --> 00:13:00,180
>> GET A JOB AND DO THOSE

517
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,082
THINGS.

518
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:03,917
>> I FEEL YOU.

519
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:14,727
I'M FORCED TO GET A JOB.

520
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,129
>> I'M FORCED TO BE A MOTHER.

521
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,931
IF I COULD GROW UP OVER NIGHT,

522
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:18,899
AND BE LIKE, "YOU KNOW WHAT?

523
00:13:18,899 --> 00:13:20,300
I HAVE TO DO WHAT I HAVE TO DO,"

524
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,169
YOU COULD DO THE SAME.

525
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:24,804
>> I'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF

526
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,239
THINGS YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED,

527
00:13:26,239 --> 00:13:28,108
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT THERE.

528
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:32,745
CAN YOU SAY YOU'VE BEEN THERE

529
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:34,647
FOR ME?

530
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:40,020
OKAY.

531
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,354
DEVOIN ISN'T ACTING LIKE THE

532
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,223
FUTURE FATHER I NEED HIM TO BE,

533
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:44,257
AND I'M NOT SURE I CAN DO THIS

534
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:46,026
WITHOUT HIM.

535
00:13:54,101 --> 00:13:55,402
>> IT SUCKS THAT DEVOIN ISN'T

536
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:56,636
SHOWING MORE INTEREST IN HELPING

537
00:13:56,636 --> 00:13:58,638
TO RAISE OUR DAUGHTER.

538
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:00,507
>> WITH OR WITHOUT DEVOIN, YOU

539
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:01,909
NEED TO THINK ABOUT YOUR FUTURE.

540
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:03,010
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO FOR

541
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:03,810
SCHOOL?

542
00:14:03,810 --> 00:14:06,313
>> I WANT TO WATCH THE BABY TILL

543
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:08,381
THE BABY'S ABOUT, LIKE, MAYBE,

544
00:14:08,381 --> 00:14:09,883
FOUR OR FIVE MONTHS.

545
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:11,851
I CAN START NIGHT SCHOOL.

546
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,086
>> YOU SHOULD START ENROLLING IN

547
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,087
DECEMBER, SO YOU CAN START

548
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:14,821
JANUARY.

549
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:15,989
WE ACTUALLY HAVE LESS THAN THREE

550
00:14:15,989 --> 00:14:17,590
MONTHS TO DO ALL OF THIS.

551
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:18,725
>> OKAY.

552
00:14:18,725 --> 00:14:19,960
>> I PROMISED YOU THAT I WOULD

553
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,594
ASSIST YOU WITH EVERYTHING THAT

554
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,696
YOU NEED FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS

555
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:24,664
OF YOUR BABY'S LIFE WHEN IT

556
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:25,765
COMES TO SCHOOL.

557
00:14:25,765 --> 00:14:26,833
AND BY THE TIME YOUR BABY'S

558
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:28,801
FIVE, YOU SHOULD ALREADY HAVE

559
00:14:28,801 --> 00:14:29,970
FINISHED SCHOOL AND STARTED A

560
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:31,238
CAREER, RIGHT?

561
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:32,139
>> MM-HMM.

562
00:14:32,139 --> 00:14:33,740
>> IF YOU DON'T DO THE SCHOOL

563
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,008
THING, BRIANA, YOU'RE IN

564
00:14:35,008 --> 00:14:35,909
TROUBLE.

565
00:14:35,909 --> 00:14:37,677
ONCE THE BABY'S A MONTH OLD,

566
00:14:37,677 --> 00:14:39,679
YOU'RE GONNA START RESEARCHING

567
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,915
WHERE IT IS THAT YOU WANT TO GO,

568
00:14:41,915 --> 00:14:43,183
AFTER TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

569
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:44,851
TO BE A MOMMY, OKAY?

570
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:45,852
'CAUSE RIGHT NOW YOUR PRIORITY

571
00:14:45,852 --> 00:14:47,087
IS BEING A MOMMY.

572
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:48,255
IT'S GONNA BE EXPENSIVE, AND

573
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:49,156
IT'S SCARY.

574
00:14:49,156 --> 00:14:50,924
THE FINANCES IS A SCARY

575
00:14:50,924 --> 00:14:52,125
SITUATION.

576
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:53,693
WE ALSO HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT IF

577
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:56,063
DEVOIN REALLY WANTS TO HELP, HE

578
00:14:56,063 --> 00:14:57,030
CAN HELP, YOU KNOW.

579
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,365
AND IT WOULD MAKE THINGS A LOT

580
00:14:58,365 --> 00:14:59,266
EASIER ON ME.

581
00:14:59,266 --> 00:15:01,501
>> I KNOW IF HE HAD MONEY, IF HE

582
00:15:01,501 --> 00:15:04,204
HAD A JOB, HE WOULD'VE BEEN

583
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:05,472
GETTING THINGS BY NOW.

584
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:07,074
I DON'T NEED HIM.

585
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:09,442
JUST BE THERE FOR BABY NOVA, AND

586
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:11,979
THAT'S IT.

587
00:15:11,979 --> 00:15:13,346
MY DUE DATE IS LESS THAN A MONTH

588
00:15:13,346 --> 00:15:15,215
AWAY, AND IT'S TIME FOR ANOTHER

589
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:16,216
SONOGRAM.

590
00:15:16,216 --> 00:15:17,384
I TEXTED DEVOIN ABOUT THE

591
00:15:17,384 --> 00:15:19,119
APPOINTMENT, BUT IT WAS NO

592
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:20,287
SURPRISE WHEN I DIDN'T HEAR FROM

593
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:20,988
HIM.

594
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:22,089
>> SO DO YOU KNOW IF IT'S A BOY

595
00:15:22,089 --> 00:15:22,689
OR GIRL?

596
00:15:22,689 --> 00:15:23,690
>> THEY SAID IT WAS A GIRL.

597
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,657
>> OKAY, WE'LL CONFIRM THAT.

598
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:25,458
>> PLEASE TELL US.

599
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,459
>> WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE SHE'S

600
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:27,160
STILL A GIRL.

601
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,927
>> OKAY, PLEASE.

602
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:28,895
>> OH, MY GOD.

603
00:15:28,895 --> 00:15:30,530
>> I'M SCARED IF IT ISN'T.

604
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,598
>> I'M GONNA PUT A LITTLE BIT OF

605
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:32,132
GEL.

606
00:15:32,132 --> 00:15:32,765
>> OKAY.

607
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:33,466
THAT'S WARM.

608
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:35,635
>> OH, THAT'S NICE.

609
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:36,769
>> SO THE FIRST THING WE'RE

610
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:38,038
GONNA DO TODAY, WE'RE GONNA SEE

611
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:38,838
THE POSITION.

612
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:40,173
HER FACE IS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF

613
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:41,174
THE SCREEN.

614
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:42,142
SO LET'S GO AHEAD AND SEE THE

615
00:15:42,142 --> 00:15:42,742
GENDER.

616
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:43,743
LET'S GO ALL THE WAY UP HERE.

617
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:44,644
>> OH, MY GOD.

618
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:45,645
CROSS YOUR FINGERS.

619
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:46,679
>> LET'S VERIFY IF SHE'S STILL A

620
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,280
GIRL.

621
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,982
>> I'M GONNA CRY IF IT'S A BOY.

622
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:50,850
>> [laughs]

623
00:15:56,356 --> 00:15:57,257
THERE WE GO.

624
00:15:57,257 --> 00:15:57,991
>> IT'S A GIRL?

625
00:15:57,991 --> 00:15:58,958
>> IT'S STILL A GIRL.

626
00:15:58,958 --> 00:15:59,626
>> YES!

627
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,995
>> OKAY, WHOO, THANK GOD.

628
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:02,895
>> CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

629
00:16:02,895 --> 00:16:03,696
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

630
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:04,397
>> THANK YOU.

631
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:06,733
>> SHE LOOKS GREAT.

632
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:07,900
>> THE TECHNICIAN PRINTED OFF

633
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,469
SOME PHOTOS AND GAVE ME A DVD OF

634
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,038
MY SONOGRAM.

635
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:12,372
IS THE DVD PLUGGED IN?

636
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:14,274
>> IT SHOULD BE.

637
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,677
>> NO, DO IT YOURSELF.

638
00:16:17,677 --> 00:16:19,546
>> WAIT, I WANT TO SEE IT TOO.

639
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:21,948
>> COME WATCH IT WITH ME.

640
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:23,616
MOM, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA COOK?

641
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:24,484
>> COME ON, LET'S COOK

642
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,152
SOMETHING.

643
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:26,019
>> CAN YOU MAKE BEANS?

644
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,020
>> OH, MY GOD, LET ME SEE IF I

645
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:27,854
HAVE THE DAMN BEANS.

646
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:28,821
>> WE'VE EATEN BEANS, LIKE,

647
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,822
THREE TIMES THIS WEEK ALREADY.

648
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:30,857
>> YOU DON'T HAVE TO EAT IT.

649
00:16:30,857 --> 00:16:31,858
>> MOM, YOU DON'T GOT TO MAKE

650
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:32,825
STUFF COMPLICATED 'CAUSE SHE

651
00:16:32,825 --> 00:16:33,460
WANTS IT.

652
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,327
WHO MAKES HER QUEEN?

653
00:16:34,327 --> 00:16:35,062
YOU KNOW WHAT?

654
00:16:35,062 --> 00:16:35,962
GET THE HELL OUT OF THE

655
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:36,663
DAMN KITCHEN.

656
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:37,664
I'M ABOUT TO COOK, 'CAUSE I'M

657
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:38,598
GETTING ME REALLY FREAKING

658
00:16:38,598 --> 00:16:39,632
ANNOYED, AND, HONESTLY, I NEED

659
00:16:39,632 --> 00:16:41,368
TO GO, 'CAUSE I HAVE PLANS.

660
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:42,169
>> WAIT, WAIT. SHH.

661
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:43,103
>> GIVE ME THE DAMN MEAT.

662
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:44,104
IT'S JUST, WHY DID YOU HAVE TO

663
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:45,138
GO OUT OF YOUR WAY TO MAKE BEANS

664
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:45,772
FOR HER?

665
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:46,773
IF SHE WANTED BEANS, SHE COULD

666
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:47,874
COOK THEM HERSELF, OR SHE COULD

667
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:48,975
WAIT TILL TOMORROW TO EAT THEM.

668
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:50,477
EVERY DAY YOU MAKE SOMETHING TO

669
00:16:50,477 --> 00:16:51,478
MEET HER WANTS.

670
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:52,445
IT'S ANNOYING.

671
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:53,346
IT REALLY IS.

672
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,447
I DON'T CARE IF SHE'S PREGNANT.

673
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:55,348
SHE'S PREGNANT; SHE'S NOT

674
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:57,417
DISABLED.

675
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:59,018
>> ARE YOU GONNA COME SEE?

676
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,620
>> BRIANA, ONCE I GET EVERYTHING

677
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,754
IN THE OVEN AND ON TOP OF THE

678
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:04,191
STOVE, I WILL RUN AND SEE

679
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:05,292
EVERYTHING WITH YOU.

680
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:06,093
GIVE ME A SECOND.

681
00:17:06,093 --> 00:17:07,660
>> [sighs]

682
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,761
>> BRIANA, YOU'RE ACTING LIKE A

683
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:09,462
LITTLE BRAT.

684
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:10,197
STOP IT, OKAY?

685
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:10,997
YOU'RE NOT A BABY.

686
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:11,864
>> 'CAUSE YOU GUYS ARE

687
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:13,366
AGGRAVATING.

688
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:18,338
>> SHUT UP, BRITTANY.

689
00:17:18,338 --> 00:17:20,740
>> WHAT?

690
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,642
WHAT'S WRONG?

691
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:27,247
>> [crying]

692
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:29,716
>> YOU'RE CRYING?

693
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:32,352
WHAT'S WRONG?

694
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:33,886
BABY.

695
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,622
YOU'RE SAD, CONFUSED,

696
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:36,689
OVERWHELMED.

697
00:17:36,689 --> 00:17:39,626
THAT'S NORMAL.

698
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,102
I'M GOING SOMEWHERE ELSE.

699
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:50,103
>> BRIT, WHY DON'T YOU WANT TO

700
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:50,703
STAY?

701
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:51,804
>> 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO STAY.

702
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:52,639
THAT'S IT.

703
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:55,342
YOU DON'T NEED AN EXPLANATION.

704
00:17:55,342 --> 00:17:57,177
>> WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

705
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,830
[chime dings]

706
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:26,539
>> THE TENSION BETWEEN ME AND MY

707
00:18:26,539 --> 00:18:28,708
SISTER IS REALLY BUMMING ME OUT,

708
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,310
ESPECIALLY SINCE MY DUE DATE IS

709
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,645
ONLY TWO WEEKS AWAY.

710
00:18:32,645 --> 00:18:33,880
I HAVE TO TIPTOE AROUND

711
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,781
BRITTANY.

712
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,450
LIKE, I CAN'T EXPRESS MY TRUE

713
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,586
FEELINGS IN FRONT OF BRITTANY,

714
00:18:39,586 --> 00:18:41,221
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT HER TO

715
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:42,822
FEEL DEPRESSED OR SAD.

716
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:44,424
TEENAGERS ARE SUPPOSED TO, YOU

717
00:18:44,424 --> 00:18:46,526
KNOW, HAVE FUN, DO THEIR THING,

718
00:18:46,526 --> 00:18:47,227
YOU KNOW?

719
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:47,960
LIVE LIFE.

720
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,297
YOU'RE ONLY YOUNG ONCE, BUT I

721
00:18:50,297 --> 00:18:51,398
CAN'T DO THAT, BECAUSE I'M

722
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:52,265
PREGNANT.

723
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:53,566
YOU CAN'T ENJOY IT LIKE A

724
00:18:53,566 --> 00:18:55,235
35-YEAR-OLD WOMAN CAN ENJOY HER

725
00:18:55,235 --> 00:18:55,902
PREGNANCY.

726
00:18:55,902 --> 00:18:56,636
>> YEAH, YEAH.

727
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:57,904
>> 'CAUSE A 35-YEAR-OLD WOMAN

728
00:18:57,904 --> 00:19:00,240
PROBABLY HAS A JOB, HER OWN

729
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,608
PLACE, YOU KNOW?

730
00:19:01,608 --> 00:19:02,542
I DON'T.

731
00:19:02,542 --> 00:19:03,510
>> DO YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE

732
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,911
SAD, YOU KNOW, BECAUSE YOU

733
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:06,613
DIDN'T ENJOY YOUR TEENAGE YEARS,

734
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:08,448
OR IS IT BECAUSE OF BRITTANY?

735
00:19:08,448 --> 00:19:09,249
>> IT'S BOTH.

736
00:19:09,249 --> 00:19:10,550
LIKE, THE OTHER DAY WITH THE

737
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:12,485
SONOGRAM SITUATION, WE HAD A

738
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,587
DVD, AND I WAS PLAYING IT IN THE

739
00:19:14,587 --> 00:19:15,855
HOUSE, AND SHE DIDN'T WANT TO

740
00:19:15,855 --> 00:19:16,556
SEE IT.

741
00:19:16,556 --> 00:19:17,524
LIKE, SHE DIDN'T WANT TO BE A

742
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:19,292
PART OF IT, SO THAT SHOWED ME

743
00:19:19,292 --> 00:19:21,160
THAT HER TIME IS GONNA COME

744
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:22,128
WHERE SHE IS GONNA GET REAL

745
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:22,795
DEPRESSED.

746
00:19:22,795 --> 00:19:23,730
>> SHE'S GONNA BREAK DOWN.

747
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,131
>> SHE SAYS THAT IT'S NOT

748
00:19:25,131 --> 00:19:26,566
GETTING TO HER, BUT...

749
00:19:26,566 --> 00:19:27,767
>> YEAH, IT IS.

750
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:28,935
>> WE ALL KNOW IT IS.

751
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:29,769
>> YEAH.

752
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:31,504
HOW DO YOU THINK BRITTANY'S

753
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,306
GONNA FEEL, LIKE, ON THE DAY OF

754
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:34,006
YOUR BIRTH?

755
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,074
>> THAT'S THE SCARY PART, 'CAUSE

756
00:19:35,074 --> 00:19:36,042
I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE'S GONNA

757
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:36,943
REACT TO THE SITUATION.

758
00:19:36,943 --> 00:19:37,977
>> DO YOU THINK SHE'LL BE IN THE

759
00:19:37,977 --> 00:19:38,678
ROOM, THOUGH?

760
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:39,446
>> SHE WANTS TO.

761
00:19:39,446 --> 00:19:40,380
>> IN THE HOSPITAL ROOM?

762
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,481
WELL, ONLY TWO MORE WEEKS, AND

763
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:42,382
YOU'LL BE GOOD.

764
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:43,416
>> I JUST DON'T WANT THE BABY TO

765
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:44,384
COME, AND THEN SHE GETS EXTRA

766
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:45,452
DEPRESSED, AND THEN SHE STRESSES

767
00:19:45,452 --> 00:19:47,420
ME OUT AND MY MOM OUT, THEN THE

768
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,422
WHOLE HOUSE COMES CRUMBLING

769
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:52,592
DOWN.

770
00:19:52,592 --> 00:19:54,093
I REALLY HOPE THINGS GET BETTER

771
00:19:54,093 --> 00:19:55,662
WITH BRITTANY SOON, 'CAUSE I'M

772
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:57,330
FEELING REALLY ALONE, ESPECIALLY

773
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:59,499
SINCE DEVOIN KEEPS IGNORING ME.

774
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:00,867
>> YOUR CALL HAS BEEN FORWARDED

775
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,269
TO AN AUTOMATED VOICE MESSAGING

776
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:04,671
SYSTEM.

777
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:07,006
>> WHILE MY FRIENDS HAVE BEEN

778
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:08,908
ENJOYING THEIR SENIOR YEAR, I'VE

779
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:10,109
BEEN STRESSED OUT AT HOME

780
00:20:10,109 --> 00:20:12,612
GETTING READY FOR THE BABY.

781
00:20:12,612 --> 00:20:14,080
I REALLY MISS HANGING OUT WITH

782
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,015
THEM, BUT TONIGHT WE DECIDED TO

783
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:18,251
GO TO A HAUNTED HOUSE.

784
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:19,886
AND I'M GLAD BRITTANY AGREED TO

785
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22,088
COME TOO.

786
00:20:22,088 --> 00:20:23,656
AH, I CAN'T WAIT TO BE SKINNY

787
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:24,857
AGAIN SO I CAN GO OUT AND DO

788
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:25,492
THINGS.

789
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:26,459
>> HOMECOMING IS IN OCTOBER.

790
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:27,560
>> I'M THINKING YOU SHOULD TAKE

791
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,094
ME.

792
00:20:28,094 --> 00:20:29,195
>> I'M THINKING YOU SHOULD TAKE

793
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:29,696
ME.

794
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:30,730
>> SHE'S GONNA BE THERE WITH THE

795
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,298
BABY.

796
00:20:31,298 --> 00:20:32,299
>> YEAH, LIKE, "COME ON, LET'S

797
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:32,899
DANCE."

798
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:34,000
WHO ARE YOU GONNA TAKE TO PROM,

799
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,634
PATRICIA?

800
00:20:34,634 --> 00:20:35,568
>> YOU KNOW MANNY?

801
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,003
HE'S TALL, SKINNY.

802
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:38,204
>> WHY DON'T YOU TAKE ME?

803
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:39,005
I COULD BE YOUR DATE.

804
00:20:39,005 --> 00:20:39,906
I'VE NEVER BEEN TO PROM.

805
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,374
DEVOIN TOOK THAT PRIVILEGE AWAY

806
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:42,108
FROM ME BY NOT

807
00:20:42,108 --> 00:20:43,376
GETTING PROM TICKETS.

808
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:44,176
>> WHAT IS THAT?

809
00:20:44,176 --> 00:20:45,211
>> OH, MY GOD, NO, NO, NO.

810
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:46,546
>> OH, MY GOD.

811
00:20:46,546 --> 00:20:49,349
>> I'M STAYING IN THE CAR.

812
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:50,583
>> WHAT IF, LIKE, I GET TOO

813
00:20:50,583 --> 00:20:52,485
SCARED AND MY WATER BREAKS?

814
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:56,022
>> IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

815
00:20:56,022 --> 00:20:56,656
COME ON.

816
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:57,624
>> IS IT GONNA BE THAT DARK?

817
00:20:57,624 --> 00:20:58,458
>> YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

818
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,326
>> IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

819
00:20:59,326 --> 00:21:00,360
>> YOU'RE ALL RIGHT; COME ON IN.

820
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:01,294
>> WELCOME TO OUR WORLD.

821
00:21:01,294 --> 00:21:02,395
>> DO YOU KNOW HOW ANY OF THESE

822
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:03,129
PEOPLE DIED?

823
00:21:03,129 --> 00:21:04,130
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW THEY DIED,

824
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:05,131
BUT WE KNOW THAT THEY'RE HERE.

825
00:21:05,131 --> 00:21:07,534
>> OKAY, ALBERT R. MYRTLE L.,

826
00:21:07,534 --> 00:21:09,869
AKA IVES, COME OUT.

827
00:21:09,869 --> 00:21:11,738
>> [laughs]

828
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:14,674
>> OH, MY GOD, THAT CHANDELIER

829
00:21:14,674 --> 00:21:15,508
IS MOVING BY ITSELF.

830
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:16,242
>> OH, MY GOD.

831
00:21:16,242 --> 00:21:17,710
>> YOU OKAY?

832
00:21:20,913 --> 00:21:22,081
MY STOMACH STARTED HURTING A

833
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:23,883
LOT, AND I WAS FEELING NAUSEOUS,

834
00:21:23,883 --> 00:21:26,218
SO BRITTANY DROVE US HOME.

835
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:27,219
>> OH, MY GOD, I THINK WE NEED

836
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:27,987
TO GO SEE A DOCTOR.

837
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:29,255
SHE'S HAVING CRAMPS.

838
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:30,189
>> OH, HELL, NO.

839
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:31,458
PLEASE, LORD, NOT TODAY.

840
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,725
NOT TONIGHT.

841
00:21:32,725 --> 00:21:33,893
>> AND AS SOON AS WE GOT BACK TO

842
00:21:33,893 --> 00:21:36,663
THE HOUSE, THE PAIN GOT WORSE.

843
00:21:36,663 --> 00:21:38,331
I CALLED DEVOIN AND TOLD HIM IT

844
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:40,166
WAS TIME, AND HE, SURPRISINGLY,

845
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,001
SHOWED UP RIGHT AWAY.

846
00:21:42,001 --> 00:21:43,169
SO MY MOM DROVE US ALL TO THE

847
00:21:43,169 --> 00:21:43,836
HOSPITAL.

848
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:46,038
>> HOW ARE YOU FEELING, BRIANA?

849
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:47,106
>> YOU OKAY, BRI?

850
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:50,410
>> COME ON.

851
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,411
>> YOU WANT ICE, 'CAUSE YOU'RE

852
00:21:51,411 --> 00:21:53,413
GONNA GET THIRSTY.

853
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:54,881
>> YOU CAN'T. YOU CAN'T.

854
00:21:54,881 --> 00:21:56,749
BREATHE, BABY.

855
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:03,222
I WAS IN A LOT OF PAIN, SO I

856
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:04,724
ASKED FOR AN EPIDURAL.

857
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:06,459
AND BEFORE I KNEW IT, THE DOCTOR

858
00:22:06,459 --> 00:22:08,327
SAID IT WAS TIME TO PUSH.

859
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:09,261
>> PUSH, PUSH, PUSH, PUSH,

860
00:22:09,261 --> 00:22:10,630
PUSH, PUSH, PUSH, PUSH, PUSH.

861
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:11,263
VERY GOOD.

862
00:22:11,263 --> 00:22:12,198
JUST LIKE THAT.

863
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:14,000
KEEP GOING, KEEP GOING.

864
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,134
TAKE A DEEP BREATH IN, AND PUSH

865
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:16,603
HARD, HARD, HARD, HARD.

866
00:22:16,603 --> 00:22:17,604
PUSH, PUSH, PUSH, PUSH, PUSH,

867
00:22:17,604 --> 00:22:18,605
PUSH, PUSH, PUSH, PUSH, PUSH.

868
00:22:18,605 --> 00:22:19,205
>> OW!

869
00:22:19,205 --> 00:22:19,972
>> ONE MORE TIME.

870
00:22:19,972 --> 00:22:22,008
THAT'S HIS HEAD.

871
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:23,042
PUSH HARD, HARD, HARD, HARD,

872
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:23,710
HARD.

873
00:22:23,710 --> 00:22:25,244
PUSH, PUSH, PUSH, PUSH, PUSH,

874
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:26,413
PUSH, PUSH, PUSH, PUSH, PUSH.

875
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:27,547
>> SHE GOT HAIR.

876
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:29,048
OH, MY GOD.

877
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:29,916
>> AGAIN, DO IT AGAIN.

878
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:31,083
PUSH, PUSH, PUSH.

879
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:33,085
>> AND PUSH HARD.

880
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:36,322
>> [screams]

881
00:22:38,891 --> 00:22:39,626
>> OH, MY GOD!

882
00:22:39,626 --> 00:22:44,731
>> * I WAS LOST *

883
00:22:44,731 --> 00:22:50,336
* GIVEN UP *

884
00:22:50,336 --> 00:22:55,875
* THERE YOU WERE *

885
00:22:55,875 --> 00:22:57,877
* THERE YOU WERE *

886
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:01,414
>> SHE'S SO CUTE!

887
00:23:01,414 --> 00:23:07,019
>> * I HAD STOPPED *

888
00:23:07,019 --> 00:23:12,592
* LOOKING FOR LOVE *

889
00:23:12,592 --> 00:23:18,164
* AND THERE YOU WERE *

890
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:22,334
* THERE YOU WERE *

891
00:23:30,342 --> 00:23:31,778
>> WHAT WAS THAT?

892
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:33,412
IT WAS NICE HAVING DEVOIN HERE

893
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:35,515
FOR NOVA'S BIRTH, BUT THE NEXT

894
00:23:35,515 --> 00:23:36,883
MORNING, HE RAN OFF TO PLAY

895
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:39,151
BASKETBALL WITH HIS FRIENDS.

896
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,620
IT'S CLEAR HE'S NOT INTERESTED

897
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,522
IN BEING A DAD FIRST, SO I

898
00:23:42,522 --> 00:23:43,523
DECIDED NOT TO PUT HIS NAME ON

899
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:45,191
THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE.

900
00:23:47,694 --> 00:23:48,695
>> NOVA.

901
00:23:48,695 --> 00:23:50,630
AND MY LAST NAME.

902
00:23:50,630 --> 00:23:51,998
WHEN DEVOIN CAME BACK AND FOUND

903
00:23:51,998 --> 00:23:53,165
OUT I LEFT HIM OFF THE BIRTH

904
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:54,467
CERTIFICATE, HE WAS REALLY

905
00:23:54,467 --> 00:23:55,768
PISSED.

906
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:56,969
AFTER YELLING AT MY MOM AND

907
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:58,905
SISTER, HE DROVE AWAY AND DIDN'T

908
00:23:58,905 --> 00:24:00,206
RETURN TO HELP ME BRING NOVA

909
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:01,608
HOME.

910
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:02,609
>> DEVOIN NEEDS TO STOP

911
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:03,910
WORRYING ABOUT THE DAMN LAST

912
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:05,077
NAME, 'CAUSE IT'S NOT GONNA BE

913
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:06,212
HIS LAST NAME.

914
00:24:06,212 --> 00:24:07,446
THE WAY HE ACTED, STORMING OUT,

915
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,516
CURSING, RIPPING OFF HIS FATHER

916
00:24:09,516 --> 00:24:10,883
BAND OR WHATEVER, LEAVING THE

917
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:13,753
HOSPITAL, WAS NOT CALLED FOR.

918
00:24:13,753 --> 00:24:14,654
>> YOU WERE NOT HERE.

919
00:24:14,654 --> 00:24:15,387
WHERE WERE YOU?

920
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:16,656
YOU SHOULD'VE STAYED IF YOU

921
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:17,790
WANTED IF YOU WANTED YOUR NAME

922
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:20,159
ON THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE.

923
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,227
OH, HE'S GONNA GO PLAY

924
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:22,161
BASKETBALL.

925
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:23,262
YOU'RE GONNA GO PLAY BASKETBALL

926
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:24,463
WHILE I'M IN THE HOSPITAL?

927
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,499
OKAY.

928
00:24:26,499 --> 00:24:28,267
OKAY.

929
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:29,068
>> GOT EVERYTHING?

930
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:30,503

YOU'RE RUDE FOR NO REASON,

1117
00:30:13,179 --> 00:30:14,881
DEVOIN, I'M SORRY.

1118
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:17,583
>> NO, IT'S THE WAY YOU'RE

1119
00:30:17,583 --> 00:30:19,718
ACTING.

1120
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:21,120
>> YEAH, YOU ARE.

1121
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,555
>> YES, I'M SERIOUS.

1122
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:25,424
>> NOBODY'S ARGUING.

1123
00:30:25,424 --> 00:30:26,525
WHO'S ARGUING RIGHT NOW?

1124
00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:27,259
WE'RE TALKING.

1125
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:28,260
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S GETTING

1126
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:28,928
OFFENSIVE.

1127
00:30:28,928 --> 00:30:29,929
>> WE'RE HERE TO MAKE IT WORK,

1128
00:30:29,929 --> 00:30:31,363
DUDE.

1129
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,500
>> YEAH.

1130
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,902
>> ALL RIGHT, BRIANA, I'LL TALK

1131
00:30:35,902 --> 00:30:38,537
TO YOU LATER.

1132
00:30:38,537 --> 00:30:43,042
[door clicks]

1133
00:30:43,042 --> 00:30:44,010
>> YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO STAY

1134
00:30:44,010 --> 00:30:48,580
STRONG.

1135
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,648
IT'S OKAY.

1136
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:51,750
DON'T CRY.

1137
00:30:51,750 --> 00:30:54,720
SHE DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU CRY.

1138
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,854
>> I'M NOT TOLERATING THAT.

1139
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:58,190
I'M NOT DEALING WITH THAT.

1140
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,226
NONE OF THAT WAS NECESSARY.

1141
00:31:00,226 --> 00:31:00,893
HE'S RUDE.

1142
00:31:00,893 --> 00:31:01,961
HE'S DISRESPECTFUL.

1143
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:03,195
>> WE'VE NEVER ASKED HIM FOR A

1144
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:03,896
DIAPER.

1145
00:31:03,896 --> 00:31:04,863
WE'VE NEVER ASKED HIM FOR A

1146
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:05,431
WIPEY.

1147
00:31:05,431 --> 00:31:06,532
HE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT KIND OF

1148
00:31:06,532 --> 00:31:07,866
FORMULA SHE DRINKS.

1149
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,401
SO YOU WANT TO BE A DAD?

1150
00:31:09,401 --> 00:31:10,937
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

1151
00:31:10,937 --> 00:31:12,104
>> BEING A FATHER IS COMING HERE

1152
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:13,339
EVERY SINGLE DAY TO SEE HIS

1153
00:31:13,339 --> 00:31:14,740
DAUGHTER, TO LEARN ABOUT HIS

1154
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,975
DAUGHTER, TO CARE FOR HIS

1155
00:31:15,975 --> 00:31:16,608
DAUGHTER.

1156
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:17,543
HE DON'T GIVE A [bleep].

1157
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:18,544
>> I KNOW YOU WANT HER TO HAVE

1158
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:19,478
HER DADDY.

1159
00:31:19,478 --> 00:31:22,181
I KNOW THAT.

1160
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:23,615
BRI, SOMETIMES SOME DADDY'S ARE

1161
00:31:23,615 --> 00:31:26,452
NOT WILLING TO WANT TO MAKE IT

1162
00:31:26,452 --> 00:31:28,320
WORK.

1163
00:31:52,044 --> 00:31:53,212
>> SINCE DEVOIN'S NOT HELPING

1164
00:31:53,212 --> 00:31:54,947
OUT AT ALL, IT'S UP TO ME TO

1165
00:31:54,947 --> 00:31:56,815
WATCH NOVA DURING THE WEEK WHILE

1166
00:31:56,815 --> 00:31:58,150
I TRY TO GET BACK ON TRACK WITH

1167
00:31:58,150 --> 00:32:00,319
SCHOOL.

1168
00:32:00,319 --> 00:32:02,321
TODAY MY MOM GOT OUT OF WORK SO

1169
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:03,689
WE CAN VISIT A LOCAL COMMUNITY

1170
00:32:03,689 --> 00:32:05,557
COLLEGE.

1171
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:09,261
>> HOW WONDERFUL TO MEET YOU.

1172
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:10,429
I'D LIKE TO GET STARTED BY

1173
00:32:10,429 --> 00:32:12,064
ASKING YOU WHAT YOUR GOALS ARE.

1174
00:32:12,064 --> 00:32:13,532
>> I JUST WANT TO START COLLEGE,

1175
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:15,334
GET MY LIFE GOING.

1176
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:18,437
>> ARE YOU LOOKING TO TAKE

1177
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:19,238
FULL-TIME CLASSES?

1178
00:32:19,238 --> 00:32:20,206
>> OKAY, WELL, I'M A TEEN

1179
00:32:20,206 --> 00:32:20,806
MOTHER.

1180
00:32:20,806 --> 00:32:21,407
>> YES.

1181
00:32:21,407 --> 00:32:22,508
>> I DON'T WANT TO PUT TOO MUCH

1182
00:32:22,508 --> 00:32:23,509
ON MY PLATE, AND THEN I CAN'T

1183
00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:24,176
HANDLE IT.

1184
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:25,544
>> MAYBE START OFF WITH ONE OR

1185
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:27,079
TWO CLASSES IN THE SPRING, SEE

1186
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:28,114
HOW THAT WORKS OUT.

1187
00:32:28,114 --> 00:32:29,148
>> NOW, HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE

1188
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:30,682
FOR ME TO GRADUATE AND FINISH?

1189
00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:32,251
>> WELL, OUR PROGRAMS ARE ALL

1190
00:32:32,251 --> 00:32:34,353
CALLED TWO-YEAR PROGRAMS, BUT IT

1191
00:32:34,353 --> 00:32:37,289
IS ALL DEPENDANT ON WHETHER

1192
00:32:37,289 --> 00:32:38,657
YOU'RE FULL-TIME OR PART-TIME.

1193
00:32:38,657 --> 00:32:39,825
IF YOU DO GO PART-TIME,

1194
00:32:39,825 --> 00:32:41,227
WHICH WOULD BE THAT ONE TO TWO

1195
00:32:41,227 --> 00:32:45,531
COURSES, IT COULD LONGER.

1196
00:32:45,531 --> 00:32:46,832
>> PART-TIME IS THE BEST OPTION

1197
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:48,500
FOR ME, SINCE SO MUCH OF MY TIME

1198
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,536
IS SPENT TAKING CARE OF NOVA.

1199
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:51,737
>> OH, MY GOD.

1200
00:32:51,737 --> 00:32:53,839
I THINK SHE'S--

1201
00:32:53,839 --> 00:32:54,740
>> ARE THEY POO-POOS?

1202
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,607
>> SHE'S A POOPY GIRL.

1203
00:32:55,607 --> 00:32:57,176
>> WE HAVE TO FEED HER.

1204
00:32:57,176 --> 00:32:58,210
>> I THINK WE HAVE TO CHANGE HER

1205
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,679
FIRST.

1206
00:33:00,679 --> 00:33:03,215
OH, MY GOD, GIRL, WAIT.

1207
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:04,183
WHERE THE HELL ARE WE GONNA

1208
00:33:04,183 --> 00:33:05,551
CHANGE HER?

1209
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:07,019
[gasps]

1210
00:33:07,019 --> 00:33:08,187
OH, MY GOD, THEY DON'T HAVE A

1211
00:33:08,187 --> 00:33:10,056
CHANGING DIAPER RACKY.

1212
00:33:10,056 --> 00:33:11,090
>> WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO, PUT HER

1213
00:33:11,090 --> 00:33:11,757
UP HERE?

1214
00:33:11,757 --> 00:33:12,558
[laughs]

1215
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:13,692
>> THAT'S TOO TALL.

1216
00:33:13,692 --> 00:33:15,927
NOVA, YOU POOPY GIRL, THANKS A

1217
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:16,895
LOT.

1218
00:33:16,895 --> 00:33:18,397
>> COME ON, BABY.

1219
00:33:18,397 --> 00:33:19,398
>> YOU'RE GONNA HOLD HER JUST

1220
00:33:19,398 --> 00:33:20,799
LIKE THIS.

1221
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,101
BITE THAT.

1222
00:33:22,101 --> 00:33:23,535
JUST HOLD THAT.

1223
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:24,903
ARE YOUR LEGS CRAMPING?

1224
00:33:24,903 --> 00:33:25,704
>> [muffled] THAT'S

1225
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:26,805
UNBELIEVABLE.

1226
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:27,906
>> DON'T DROOL.

1227
00:33:27,906 --> 00:33:29,341
OOH, SHE POOPY!

1228
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:32,111
NOVA, COME ON, GIRL.

1229
00:33:32,111 --> 00:33:33,279
SHE'S STILL PUSHING.

1230
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,982
GREAT.

1231
00:33:36,982 --> 00:33:37,849
>> [giggles]

1232
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,119
THIS STINKS.

1233
00:33:41,787 --> 00:33:43,155
NOVA, STAY STILL, CHICA. 

1234
00:33:43,155 --> 00:33:45,057
COME ON, WORK WITH ME.

1235
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:50,262
>> IT SUCKS, BECAUSE DEVOIN

1236
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:51,397
COULD'VE BEEN HERE.

1237
00:33:51,397 --> 00:33:53,365
I COULD'VE LET DEVOIN BABYSIT

1238
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,633
THE BABY WHILE I WAS IN SCHOOL,

1239
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:56,135
BUT...

1240
00:33:56,135 --> 00:33:58,104
>> WHATEVER IT TAKES, YOU HAVE

1241
00:33:58,104 --> 00:33:59,205
TO COME TO SCHOOL, BRIANA.

1242
00:33:59,205 --> 00:34:00,239
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE

1243
00:34:00,239 --> 00:34:01,607
SACRIFICES.

1244
00:34:01,607 --> 00:34:04,110
>> WE'RE IN SCHOOL, BABY.

1245
00:34:04,110 --> 00:34:05,010
YOU'RE GONNA BE HERE IN

1246
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,945
ANOTHER--HOW MANY YEARS?

1247
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:08,514
>> ARE YOU NERVOUS ABOUT IT?

1248
00:34:08,514 --> 00:34:09,715
>> I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GONNA BE

1249
00:34:09,715 --> 00:34:12,884
ABLE TO JUGGLE SCHOOL, BEING A

1250
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,887
MOTHER, TAKING CARE OF HER, AND

1251
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:19,825
HOW I FEEL ABOUT DEVOIN AND MY

1252
00:34:19,825 --> 00:34:22,494
EMOTIONAL STATE.

1253
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:23,729
>> I KNOW YOU'RE EMOTIONALLY

1254
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:25,597
EXHAUSTED.

1255
00:34:25,597 --> 00:34:27,699
YOU JUST HAD A BABY.

1256
00:34:27,699 --> 00:34:29,535
YOU'RE 17 YEARS OLD, TRYING TO

1257
00:34:29,535 --> 00:34:31,270
GO TO COLLEGE, TRYING TO STILL

1258
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:33,038
BE A TEENAGER, BECAUSE YOU'RE

1259
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:34,906
STILL NOT AN ADULT.

1260
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:38,810
I KNOW IT'S HARD.

1261
00:34:51,123 --> 00:34:52,524
>> I'M USUALLY REALLY EXCITED

1262
00:34:52,524 --> 00:34:54,426
FOR HALLOWEEN, BUT THIS YEAR IS

1263
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:55,927
DIFFERENT, BECAUSE I HAVE TO

1264
00:34:55,927 --> 00:34:57,163
STAY HOME WITH THE BABY ALL

1265
00:34:57,163 --> 00:34:58,630
NIGHT, WHILE BRITTANY GETS TO

1266
00:34:58,630 --> 00:34:59,898
HAVE FUN WITH HER FRIENDS.

1267
00:34:59,898 --> 00:35:00,599

1268
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:04,303
>> BYE.

1269
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:05,937
>> THIS IS HAUNTED, FOR REAL.

1270
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:07,406
I'M SCARED.

HOUSE.

1282
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:29,828
THEY'RE HAVING FUN.

1283
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:37,336
IT'S PRETTY CLEAR I'M GOING TO

1284
00:35:37,336 --> 00:35:39,004
BE SACRIFICING A LOT TO RAISE

1285
00:35:39,004 --> 00:35:40,339
NOVA ON MY OWN.

1286
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:42,007
I REALLY WAS EXPECTING MORE OUT

1287
00:35:42,007 --> 00:35:44,042
OF DEVOIN.

1288
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:45,977
>> I THINK THAT WHEN YOU DECIDED

1289
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:47,112
TO HAVE NOVA, YOU THOUGHT

1290
00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:48,447
EVERYTHING WAS GONNA BE SO

1291
00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:50,316
DIFFERENT, AND NOW THAT IT IS,

1292
00:35:50,316 --> 00:35:51,650
YOU JUST CAN'T EVEN

1293
00:35:51,650 --> 00:35:55,254
COMPREHEND IT.

1294
00:35:55,254 --> 00:35:56,555
AND I THINK IT'S HURTING YOU

1295
00:35:56,555 --> 00:35:59,191
REALLY BAD.

1296
00:35:59,191 --> 00:36:00,326
>> I DON'T WANT TO BE SAD

1297
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:02,194

STOP WHAT HE'S DOING.

COMPLETELY.

1370

I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW, SHE WOULD

1371
00:39:27,065 --> 00:39:28,700
BE, LIKE, REBELLIOUS AGAINST

1372
00:39:28,700 --> 00:39:30,502
EVERYTHING, BUT SHE HAS SHOWN SO

ANYMORE, BECAUSE I'M NOT DOING

1378

1388
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:01,633
