1
00:00:03,604 --> 00:00:04,672
>> [laughs]

2
00:00:04,672 --> 00:00:06,240
HI, I'M KATIE.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,541
WE SHOULD JUST, LIKE, DANCE IN,

4
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:08,376
LIKE, ONE BIG GROUP.

5
00:00:08,376 --> 00:00:09,477
AND I'M FROM ROCK SPRINGS,

6
00:00:09,477 --> 00:00:10,678
WYOMING.

7
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:11,779
THERE'S NOT MUCH OUT HERE

8
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:13,347
BESIDES MOUNTAINS AND WIDE-OPEN

9
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,015
SPACE, BUT MY FRIENDS AND I

10
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,250
FIND WAYS TO HAVE FUN.

11
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,918
DON'T DO ANYTHING SCARY!

12
00:00:17,918 --> 00:00:19,019
MY PARENTS ARE DIVORCED,

13
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,221
BUT I'M STILL REALLY CLOSE WITH

14
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:20,954
BOTH OF THEM.

15
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:22,423
BUT THE PERSON I'M CLOSEST WITH

16
00:00:22,423 --> 00:00:24,092
IS MY BOYFRIEND, JOEY.

17
00:00:24,092 --> 00:00:25,326
JOEY AND I ARE ATTACHED AT

18
00:00:25,326 --> 00:00:26,894
THE HIP, AND WE DO EVERYTHING

19
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:27,661
TOGETHER.

20
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:28,596
I HOPE IT STAYS LIKE THIS

21
00:00:28,596 --> 00:00:29,363
FOREVER.

22
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:30,531
AND SINCE OUR FAMILIES GET ALONG

23
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:32,066
GREAT, MY MOM LET ME MOVE IN

24
00:00:32,066 --> 00:00:33,567
WITH HIM, SO NOW JOEY AND I LIVE

25
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:35,303
WITH HIS MOM AND STEP-DAD

26
00:00:35,303 --> 00:00:36,337
AND HIS LITTLE BROTHER AND

27
00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:38,406
SISTER.

28
00:00:38,406 --> 00:00:39,673
I'M ALMOST DONE WITH MY SENIOR

29
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:40,541
YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL.

30
00:00:40,541 --> 00:00:42,076
I GET REALLY GOOD GRADES,

31
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:43,277
AND I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO GO

32
00:00:43,277 --> 00:00:44,512
AWAY TO COLLEGE IN DENVER.

33
00:00:44,512 --> 00:00:46,080
MY LONG-TERM PLAN IS TO GET

34
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,948
A MASTER'S DEGREE IN PSYCHOLOGY.

35
00:00:47,948 --> 00:00:49,683
AND EVERYBODY IS GONNA CALL ME

36
00:00:49,683 --> 00:00:50,851
DR. KATIE.

37
00:00:50,851 --> 00:00:51,885
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE I'M GOING TO

38
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:53,554
HAVE TO PUT THAT ON HOLD

39
00:00:53,554 --> 00:00:54,222
BECAUSE...

40
00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:55,156
[chime dings]

41
00:00:55,156 --> 00:00:57,158
I'M PREGNANT.

42
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:06,267
I'M SIX MONTHS PREGNANT AND

43
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:07,468
NEARING THE END OF MY SENIOR

44
00:01:07,468 --> 00:01:09,069
YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL.

45
00:01:09,069 --> 00:01:10,371
BUT IT'S SUNDAY AND ONE OF

46
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:11,539
THE FIRST NICE SPRING DAYS OF

47
00:01:11,539 --> 00:01:12,240
THE YEAR.

48
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,006
>> WHERE DO YOU WANT TO SIT?

49
00:01:13,006 --> 00:01:14,775
>> JOEY'S BEEN SO SUPPORTIVE,

50
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:16,277
AND I LOVE GETTING TO SPEND TIME

51
00:01:16,277 --> 00:01:17,978
WITH HIM.

52
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:18,946
WE'VE KNOWN EACH OTHER FOR

53
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:20,381
A LONG TIME.

54
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:21,949
>> LIKE, 12 OR 13, PROBABLY.

55
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:22,616
>> MM-HMM.

56
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,385
YOU WORE, LIKE, SKINNY PANTS,

57
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:26,053
LIKE, SILVER JEANS.

58
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:26,954
>> [laughs]

59
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:28,256
>> AND THEY WERE, LIKE, GIRL

60
00:01:28,256 --> 00:01:28,956
PANTS.

61
00:01:28,956 --> 00:01:30,891
I WAS LIKE, "JOEY IS SO HOT."

62
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:31,625
[chuckles]

63
00:01:31,625 --> 00:01:33,093
I NEVER KNEW YOU AS THE TYPE OF

64
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,762
GUY THAT WOULD, LIKE, WANT

65
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:36,029
A GIRLFRIEND.

66
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:37,231
>> 'CAUSE I'M NOT THE TYPE OF

67
00:01:37,231 --> 00:01:38,232
GUY THAT NORMALLY WANTED

68
00:01:38,232 --> 00:01:39,300
A GIRLFRIEND.

69
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,301
>> IT'S FUNNY, THOUGH, 'CAUSE,

70
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:41,569
LIKE, WE WOULD SLEEP IN THE SAME

71
00:01:41,569 --> 00:01:43,070
BED, BUT I WOULD NEVER LET YOU

72
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,238
HAVE SEX WITH ME.

73
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:45,706
I JUST, LIKE, WANTED YOU TO BE

74
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,341
IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH ME BEFORE

75
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:49,009
I, LIKE--I DIDN'T WANT TO BE,

76
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:50,811
LIKE, SOME STUPID HO THAT, LIKE,

77
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:51,945
CAME TO YOUR HOUSE AND, LIKE,

78
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:53,481
JUST HAD SEX WITH YOU.

79
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:55,183
I WANTED YOU TO RESPECT ME.

80
00:01:55,183 --> 00:01:56,417
>> I DID.

81
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:57,518
>> SO AROUND THE TIME THAT WE

82
00:01:57,518 --> 00:01:58,786
GOT PREGNANT, BIRTH CONTROL WAS,

83
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:00,421
LIKE, NEVER A BIG DEAL, BECAUSE

84
00:02:00,421 --> 00:02:01,855
IT WAS JUST, LIKE, YOU REACHED

85
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:03,224
OVER AND GRABBED A CONDOM,

86
00:02:03,224 --> 00:02:03,857
AND IT WAS THAT--

87
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:05,226
>> SOMETIMES.

88
00:02:05,226 --> 00:02:06,494
IF THEY WERE THERE, I USED THEM;

89
00:02:06,494 --> 00:02:08,762
IF NOT, THEN WE JUST KIND OF DID

90
00:02:08,762 --> 00:02:09,563
OUR THING.

91
00:02:09,563 --> 00:02:10,598
>> I JUST WISH I WOULD'VE, LIKE,

92
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:12,433
REALIZED THAT BEFORE, LIKE, THAT

93
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:14,335
IT WAS, LIKE, NOT YOUR JOB;

94
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:15,436
IT WAS MY JOB.

95
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:16,103
>> I DON'T KNOW.

96
00:02:16,103 --> 00:02:18,172
I THINK IT'S BOTH PEOPLE'S JOB,

97
00:02:18,172 --> 00:02:19,940
BUT APPARENTLY I DIDN'T DO TOO

98
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,942
GOOD OF A JOB.

99
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:24,578
>> OUR FRIENDS WERE SHOCKED WHEN

100
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:25,646
THEY FOUND OUT WE WERE HAVING

101
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:27,147
A BABY.

102
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,682
THE DAY THAT I FOUND OUT I WAS

103
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:30,050
PREGNANT--I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW

104
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,585
YET, LIKE, THAT DAY THAT I

105
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:32,620
CALLED YOU ON THE PHONE.

106
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:33,621
WHEN I WAS CRYING, AND I WAS

107
00:02:33,621 --> 00:02:35,323
LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING

108
00:02:35,323 --> 00:02:37,525
TO HAPPEN" AND ALL THAT STUFF.

109
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:38,592
AND YOU'RE LIKE, "WELL, HAVE YOU

110
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:39,393
TAKEN A TEST?"

111
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:40,361
AND I'M LIKE, "I HAVEN'T LOOKED

112
00:02:40,361 --> 00:02:40,928
AT IT YET."

113
00:02:40,928 --> 00:02:41,595
YOU'RE LIKE...

114
00:02:41,595 --> 00:02:42,463
>> "WELL, CALL ME BACK."

115
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:43,163
>> "WELL, CALL ME BACK

116
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,765
WHEN YOU KNOW."

117
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:45,766
>> I REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME

118
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:46,667
YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU GUYS KNEW

119
00:02:46,667 --> 00:02:47,501
SHE WAS PREGNANT.

120
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:48,369
I THOUGHT YOU WERE JUST PULLING

121
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:49,203
MY CHAIN, BRO.

122
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:50,538
>> [laughs]

123
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:51,205
>> "NO, SHE'S NOT.

124
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:52,406
DON'T LIE TO ME."

125
00:02:52,406 --> 00:02:53,641
EVERYTHING'S CHANGED SO MUCH.

126
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:55,476
WE USED TO BE PARTY, PARTY,

127
00:02:55,476 --> 00:02:57,978
PARTY, SLEEP, PARTY, YOU KNOW?

128
00:02:57,978 --> 00:02:58,979
>> IT'S 'CAUSE HE MET ME,

129
00:02:58,979 --> 00:03:01,749
AND I STRAIGHTENED HIM OUT.

130
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:02,916
>> MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS,

131
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,553
IF JOEY WAS, LIKE, HAPPY OR MAD

132
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:06,654
ABOUT IT, AND THEN WHEN

133
00:03:06,654 --> 00:03:07,521
YOU TOLD ME HE WAS HAPPY,

134
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,323
LIKE--IT WAS KIND OF,

135
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:10,090
LIKE, A RELIEF.

136
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,725
AT LEAST YOU HAVE SOMEONE BESIDE

137
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:13,761
YOU, LIKE, HELPING YOU NOW.

138
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:15,195
>> THAT WAS MY BIGGEST FEAR THAT

139
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,364
JOEY WAS GONNA BE LIKE, "WELL,

140
00:03:16,364 --> 00:03:17,765
I'M STILL A KID," YOU KNOW,

141
00:03:17,765 --> 00:03:20,434
AND COMPLETELY BOOK IT OUT OF

142
00:03:20,434 --> 00:03:21,735
MY LIFE.

143
00:03:21,735 --> 00:03:23,837
BUT THEN WHEN I SAW, LIKE--AFTER

144
00:03:23,837 --> 00:03:25,506
I WAS CRYING THE WHOLE TIME AND,

145
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:27,441
LIKE, FREAKING OUT, AND I SAW

146
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:28,376
THAT HE WAS, LIKE, STILL

147
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:31,679
THERE--AND THAT KIND OF JUST

148
00:03:31,679 --> 00:03:33,847
MADE ME FEEL LIKE, "OKAY, I'M

149
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:34,882
PRETTY LUCKY, 'CAUSE THAT

150
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:35,816
DOESN'T HAPPEN."

151
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,017
LIKE, NORMALLY THE GUY IS

152
00:03:37,017 --> 00:03:37,918
THE FIRST ONE TO RUN

153
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:39,387
IN THE OTHER DIRECTION.

154
00:03:39,387 --> 00:03:40,988
BUT THAT'S THE FIRST TIME I EVER

155
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:44,858
TRUSTED A GUY, WAS AFTER THAT.

156
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:46,827
I KNOW I'M LUCKY TO HAVE JOEY,

157
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:48,262
AND I HOPE THINGS DON'T CHANGE

158
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:50,298
TOO MUCH ONCE THE BABY COMES,

159
00:03:50,298 --> 00:03:51,565
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE MY BEST

160
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:52,966
FRIEND IS ABOUT TO HEAD OFF TO

161
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:54,201
COLLEGE WITHOUT ME.

162
00:03:54,201 --> 00:03:56,036
>> I AM LEAVING, LIKE, NEXT

163
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:56,770
MONTH.

164
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:58,506
>> I FEEL DITCHED.

165
00:03:58,506 --> 00:04:00,040
>> DO NOT FEEL DITCHED.

166
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,909
>> LIKE, I WANTED TO GO TO

167
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:02,576
DENVER WITH YOU.

168
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,977
I WANTED TO LIVE WITH MY BEST

169
00:04:03,977 --> 00:04:07,080
FRIEND IN THE BEST CITY ON THIS

170
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,948
PART OF THE WORLD.

171
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:10,751
AND NOW, LIKE, I CAN'T DO THAT.

172
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,085
>> I WAS LIKE, "WE HAVE BEEN

173
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,087
PLANNING THIS SINCE DAY ONE."

174
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,456
>> IT WAS SO FRUSTRATING,

175
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:16,457
THOUGH, WHEN THE LADY FROM

176
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:17,458
THE ADMISSION OFFICE--

177
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,258
>> MM-HMM, I REMEMBER WHEN YOU

178
00:04:18,258 --> 00:04:18,992
GOT ACCEPTED, AND YOU WERE

179
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:19,660
SO HAPPY.

180
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,529
>> YEAH, I TOLD HER--I WAS LIKE,

181
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:22,963
"I CAN'T COME."

182
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:25,198
AND SHE'S LIKE, "OH, WELL, ARE

183
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:26,367
YOU GOING SOMEWHERE ELSE?"

184
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:27,668
I WAS LIKE, "YEAH, I'M GOING TO

185
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:28,836
COMMUNITY COLLEGE."

186
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:29,570
[both laugh]

187
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,338
>> YOU'RE LIKE, "UGH."

188
00:04:30,338 --> 00:04:31,805
>> AND I WAS ALL UPSET.

189
00:04:31,805 --> 00:04:34,842
"I GOT PREGNANT, AND SO NOW I

190
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:36,109
JUST HAVE OTHER PRIORITIES IN

191
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,178
LIFE, AND I COULDN'T DO, LIKE,

192
00:04:38,178 --> 00:04:40,013
UNIVERSITY AND BABY AND--

193
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:41,281
BUT I THINK YOU HAVE A FABULOUS,

194
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:42,350
FABULOUS SCHOOL.

195
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:43,851
IT'S A SCHOOL OF DREAMS."

196
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:44,685
>> YOU'RE LIKE, "IT WAS MY

197
00:04:44,685 --> 00:04:45,386
DREAM."

198
00:04:45,386 --> 00:04:46,053
>> YEAH.

199
00:04:46,053 --> 00:04:49,357
>> SO AFTER YOU, LIKE, HAVE...

200
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:51,224
THE LITTLE ONE, ARE YOU GONNA,

201
00:04:51,224 --> 00:04:52,526
LIKE, GO TO DENVER LIKE YOU

202
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:53,193
WANTED TO?

203
00:04:53,193 --> 00:04:54,061
>> ME AND JOEY, LIKE, HAVE

204
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:55,028
TALKED ABOUT THAT,

205
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,130
MOVING IN TWO YEARS.

206
00:04:57,130 --> 00:04:58,432
LIKE, HIM GETTING A JOB AND US

207
00:04:58,432 --> 00:04:59,299
SAVING MONEY.

208
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,167
IT'LL STILL HAPPEN.

209
00:05:00,167 --> 00:05:01,502
IT JUST WON'T BE THE SAME WAY

210
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:02,803
THAT I WANTED IT TO BE, LIKE--

211
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:03,537
>> YEAH.

212
00:05:03,537 --> 00:05:04,705
>> THE WAY THAT I PLANNED

213
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:06,707
EVERYTHING TO BE.

214
00:05:09,577 --> 00:05:11,512
EVEN THOUGH I LIVE AT JOEY'S,

215
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:13,547
I STILL GO TO SEE MY MOM A LOT.

216
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:15,383
TONIGHT SHE'S HAVING US OVER

217
00:05:15,383 --> 00:05:16,417
FOR DINNER.

218
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:17,918
MY MOM WAS PRETTY DISAPPOINTED

219
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:18,886
WHEN SHE FOUND OUT I WAS

220
00:05:18,886 --> 00:05:20,888
PREGNANT, BECAUSE MY EDUCATION

221
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:23,256
IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO HER.

222
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:24,291
>> IT'S GONNA BE A STRESSFUL

223
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:27,428
YEAR THAT--NOW, YOU GOT INTO

224
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:28,396
BOISE STATE.

225
00:05:28,396 --> 00:05:30,263
YOU GOT INTO UTAH STATE, AND NOW

226
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,565
ALL THAT STUFF HAS TO BE PUT ON

227
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:32,265
THE BACK BURNER.

228
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,467
>> YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY

229
00:05:33,467 --> 00:05:35,703
INSTEAD OF GOING TO SCHOOL.

230
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:36,670
WELL, I GUESS YOU'RE GONNA DO

231
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,738
BOTH, BUT WHO'S GONNA WATCH

232
00:05:37,738 --> 00:05:38,572
THE BABY?

233
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:39,473
>> THE BABY'S NOT GONNA BE

234
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:41,675
LIKE, "OKAY, I'M NOT GONNA CRY

235
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:43,243
WHILE YOU'RE ON THE COMPUTER

236
00:05:43,243 --> 00:05:44,778
DOING YOUR HOMEWORK."

237
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:45,446
>> I KNOW.

238
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:46,447
>> NOT HAPPENING.

239
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:47,314
>> THAT'S WHY YOU DO IT WHEN

240
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:48,616
THE BABY'S ASLEEP.

241
00:05:48,616 --> 00:05:49,883
>> THEY MIGHT STAY UP--

242
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:51,685
SLEEP FIVE OR TEN MINUTES.

243
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:53,053
>> THAT'S WHY JOEY GETS TO HOLD

244
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:54,622
THE BABY WHEN I DO MY HOMEWORK.

245
00:05:54,622 --> 00:05:55,288
[laughs]

246
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:56,657
>> JOEY WILL BE AT WORK.

247
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:57,425
>> NOT IF I DO MY STUFF

248
00:05:57,425 --> 00:05:58,091
AT NIGHT.

249
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,326
>> THEN IN THE MORNING TIME WHEN

250
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:00,961
IT'S FINALLY ASLEEP AND YOU'RE

251
00:06:00,961 --> 00:06:02,195
TIRED, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

252
00:06:02,195 --> 00:06:03,263
NOT SLEEP?

253
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,565
>> YOU THINK THINGS ARE GONNA BE

254
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:05,433
A LOT EASIER.

255
00:06:05,433 --> 00:06:07,067
BEING A GROWN-UP'S NOT AS EASY

256
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:08,101
AS YOU THINK IT IS.

257
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,269
>> I KNOW, BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO

258
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:10,337
MAKE IT SOUND LIKE IT'S SO

259
00:06:10,337 --> 00:06:11,238
[bleep].

260
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:12,139
I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE [bleep].

261
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,306
>> OKAY, EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE

262
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:14,141
ROSES.

263
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:15,242
YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE TO WORK TO

264
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:16,143
GET ANYTHING.

265
00:06:16,143 --> 00:06:17,077
YOU'RE JUST GONNA GET EVERYTHING

266
00:06:17,077 --> 00:06:18,145
HANDED TO YOU.

267
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:19,513
THIS IS OUR REALITY.

268
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:20,948
I'M TRYING TO PREPARE YOU FOR

269
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:22,883
WHAT YOUR FUTURE HOLDS.

270
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:23,884
>> YOU COULD BE THE LEAST BIT

271
00:06:23,884 --> 00:06:24,718
PROUD OF ME, THOUGH.

272
00:06:24,718 --> 00:06:25,453
IT WOULDN'T HURT.

273
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:26,920
>> I AM PROUD OF YOU.

274
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,623
I SAY IT ALL THE TIME.

275
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:30,891
>> IT'D BE NICE IF YOU COULD

276
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:32,893
JUST, LIKE, SAY ONE NICE THING.

277
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:39,467
[crying]

278
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:52,045
>> I WISH MY MOM WOULD HAVE MORE

279
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:52,913
FAITH IN ME.

280
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,081
I WANT TO PROVE HER WRONG,

281
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:55,449
SO I'VE BEEN STUDYING REALLY

282
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:57,084
HARD DURING THE WEEK AND WORKING

283
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:57,818
AT A BABY SUPPLY STORE ON

284
00:06:57,818 --> 00:06:59,820
THE WEEKENDS.

285
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:05,459
>> JOEY GOT HIS G.E.D., AND NOW

286
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:06,927
HE WORKS SIX DAYS A WEEK AT

287
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,061
A TRACTOR RENTAL SHOP,

288
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,362
BUT HE'S TRYING TO GET A JOB

289
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:10,798
WORKING AT THE MINES WHERE HE'LL

290
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:11,999
MAKE MUCH MORE MONEY.

291
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:13,567
[chime dings]

292
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,002
OUR BABY GIRL IS DUE IN

293
00:07:15,002 --> 00:07:17,037
2 1/2 MONTHS, AND WE DECIDED TO

294
00:07:17,037 --> 00:07:18,639
NAME HER MOLLI.

295
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,207
I REALLY WANT JOEY AND I TO GET

296
00:07:20,207 --> 00:07:21,241
OUR OWN PLACE TO START OUR

297
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:22,643
FAMILY, BUT JOEY DOESN'T THINK

298
00:07:22,643 --> 00:07:24,077
WE CAN AFFORD IT NOW AND WANTS

299
00:07:24,077 --> 00:07:25,078
TO CONTINUE LIVING WITH

300
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:25,846
HIS PARENTS.

301
00:07:25,846 --> 00:07:27,380
BUT THEY ALREADY HAVE TWO KIDS

302
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,049
AND NOT MUCH ROOM FOR A THIRD.

303
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:30,618
>> I GUESS MY QUESTION IS,

304
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:32,119
HOW LONG ARE YOU GUYS

305
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:32,920
STAYING HERE?

306
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,321
NOT THAT I'M TRYING TO KICK YOU

307
00:07:34,321 --> 00:07:35,989
OUT WHEN YOU GET HERE, BUT I

308
00:07:35,989 --> 00:07:36,890
JUST WANT TO KNOW WHAT--

309
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:37,991
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

310
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:40,360
>> I DON'T WANT, LIKE, TO BRING

311
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,695
THE BABY HOME HERE, BECAUSE I

312
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:43,497
DON'T WANT TO PUSH MY CHILD

313
00:07:43,497 --> 00:07:44,364
ON YOU GUYS.

314
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:45,666
LIKE, I WANT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE

315
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:46,333
CARE OF MY KID.

316
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,334
>> THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING I WANT

317
00:07:47,334 --> 00:07:48,602
TO SEE IF I CAN, YOU KNOW--

318
00:07:48,602 --> 00:07:49,870
IF THAT JOB DOWN AT THE MINES

319
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,404
IS A GO OR NOT, BECAUSE IF IT

320
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:52,472
IS, THEN WE WON'T HAVE ANYTHING

321
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:53,674
TO WORRY ABOUT THEN, BECAUSE

322
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:54,508
THAT'S JUST A [bleep]-TON

323
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:55,342
OF MONEY.

324
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:57,410
>> SO, UH, YOU GET ONTO THE JOB

325
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:59,146
THERE, THEN YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE

326
00:07:59,146 --> 00:08:00,648
GOING TO BE FINANCIALLY STABLE?

327
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:02,883
AND WHERE IS IT THAT YOU GUYS

328
00:08:02,883 --> 00:08:04,384
ARE LOOKING AT?

329
00:08:04,384 --> 00:08:06,019
>> I DON'T KNOW.

330
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:07,521
>> IF YOU APPLY FOR INCOME-BASED

331
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:09,189
HOUSING, IT WOULD BE A GOOD

332
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:12,192
START, BECAUSE YOU NEED TO LEARN

333
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:13,426
HOW TO BUDGET YOUR MONEY.

334
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:14,427
>> IF YOU GUYS WANT AN

335
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:15,996
APARTMENT, YOU HAVE TO APPLY

336
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:16,797
FOR THAT.

337
00:08:16,797 --> 00:08:18,431
YOU GOT TO GET YOUR PROCESS

338
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:19,266
STARTED.

339
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:20,367
>> THE THING THAT FRUSTRATES ME

340
00:08:20,367 --> 00:08:21,434
IS, LIKE, WELL, WE'VE BOTH KNOWN

341
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,070
THAT WE'VE NEEDED TO HAVE

342
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,171
A HOUSE.

343
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,505
I KNOW I'LL BE FREAKING OUT IF

344
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,875
IT'S, LIKE, A MONTH BEFORE,

345
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:28,876
AND I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE

346
00:08:28,876 --> 00:08:31,879
TO SET UP A BABY ROOM YET.

347
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:33,246
WHILE WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

348
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:34,181
WHERE WE'RE GOING TO RAISE

349
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,115
OUR DAUGHTER...

350
00:08:35,115 --> 00:08:35,783
[chime dings]

351
00:08:35,783 --> 00:08:36,784
ALL OUR FRIENDS ARE HAVING FUN

352
00:08:36,784 --> 00:08:38,485
AT THE END OF THEIR SENIOR YEAR.

353
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:39,920
BUT I DECIDED NOT TO LET THE

354
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:40,954
FACT THAT I'M ALMOST SEVEN

355
00:08:40,954 --> 00:08:42,623
MONTHS PREGNANT STOP ME FROM

356
00:08:42,623 --> 00:08:44,625
GOING TO THE SENIOR PROM.

357
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,961
MY FRIENDS AND I ARE MAKING IT

358
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,797
A GIRLS NIGHT, AND I'M EXCITED

359
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:51,364
TO HAVE A FUN NIGHT OUT...

360
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,432
>> HEY.

361
00:08:52,432 --> 00:08:53,233
>> HEY, WHAT'S UP, DUDE?

362
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:54,334
>> IF I CAN FIND A DRESS

363
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:55,002
THAT FITS.

364
00:08:55,002 --> 00:08:56,403
>> IT'S, LIKE, STUCK.

365
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:57,404
TAKE IT ALL THE WAY DOWN,

366
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:59,873
AND THEN GO ALL THE WAY UP.

367
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,341
HOW'S THAT FITTING, KATIE?

368
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:02,442
>> IT'S BETTER.

369
00:09:02,442 --> 00:09:04,978
THERE'S NO ZIPPER, SO...

370
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:07,214
I FEEL FAT, BUT...

371
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,081
>> WHY?

372
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:10,984

00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:16,963
HE BARELY ACKNOWLEDGES ME.

746
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:18,598
I KNOW HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK

747
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,099
TO ME ABOUT FINDING A PLACE

748
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,934
ANYMORE, BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN

749
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,236
THAT HE HAS TO IGNORE ME

750
00:18:23,236 --> 00:18:24,171
ALTOGETHER.

751
00:18:24,171 --> 00:18:24,937
>> HELLO?

752
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:26,273
>> HEY.

753
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:27,174
>> HEY.

754
00:18:27,174 --> 00:18:29,108
>> WHAT'S UP?

755
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,110
>> NOT MUCH.

756
00:18:33,746 --> 00:18:35,081
>> WELL, IT'S JUST, LIKE...

757
00:18:35,081 --> 00:18:36,749
LIKE, HE'S ALWAYS AT WORK,

758
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:39,152
AND I SIT HERE BORED ALL DAY,

759
00:18:39,152 --> 00:18:39,919
AND THEN HE COMES HOME

760
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,589
FROM WORK, AND HE DOESN'T EVEN,

761
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:43,923
LIKE, TALK TO ME OR WANT TO TALK

762
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:46,092
TO ME OR ASK ME HOW MY DAY IS

763
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:47,427
AT ALL, LIKE...

764
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:48,595
>> YEAH.

765
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:49,929
>> SO I'M PRETTY MUCH ALONE

766
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:51,097
ALL THE TIME, IT FEELS LIKE.

767
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:51,931
LIKE, I'M ALONE IN

768
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:55,134
A RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM, LIKE...

769
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,469
>> YEAH.

770
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,205
>> WHEN YOU SPEND ALL DAY ALONE,

771
00:18:58,205 --> 00:18:59,138
YOU'RE KIND OF NEEDY FOR

772
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,140
ATTENTION.

773
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:06,613
>> IT'S REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE

774
00:19:06,613 --> 00:19:08,381
BEING IGNORED BY JOEY, AND IF

775
00:19:08,381 --> 00:19:09,582
THINGS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE

776
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:11,218
LIKE THIS, I'M NOT SURE HIS

777
00:19:11,218 --> 00:19:12,552
PARENTS' HOUSE IS THE BEST PLACE

778
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:13,953
FOR ME TO BE STAYING.

779
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:14,654
HEY.

780
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:15,922
>> HEY.

781
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:18,358
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING TONIGHT?

782
00:19:18,358 --> 00:19:20,092
>> I'M GOING TO MY DAD'S.

783
00:19:20,092 --> 00:19:21,361
>> DO YOU REALLY HAVE TO GO,

784
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:22,395
LIKE, SERIOUSLY?

785
00:19:22,395 --> 00:19:23,330
>> I TOLD YOU THREE DAYS AGO

786
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,564
I WAS GOING.

787
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:25,465
>> YOU GO OUT THERE ALL

788
00:19:25,465 --> 00:19:26,165
THE TIME.

789
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,568
>> NO, I GO OUT THERE ONCE,

790
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:29,836
TWICE A MONTH.

791
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:30,737
>> YOU'VE GONE OUT THERE

792
00:19:30,737 --> 00:19:32,705
QUITE A BIT, AND I NEVER GET ANY

793
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:33,706
TIME TO SPEND WITH YOU.

794
00:19:33,706 --> 00:19:35,007
ALL I DO IS WAIT FOR YOU TO COME

795
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:36,876
HOME FROM WORK, AND YOU DON'T

796
00:19:36,876 --> 00:19:38,778
TALK TO ME ABOUT THINGS.

797
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:41,214
>> OKAY.

798
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:42,515
>> YOU CAN GO, BUT DON'T EXPECT

799
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,517
ME TO BE HERE WHEN YOU GET BACK.

800
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:46,619
I'M SICK OF COMING SECOND.

801
00:19:46,619 --> 00:19:48,455
I SHOULD BE FIRST.

802
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:49,922
>> THAT'S HOW IT'S GONNA BE?

803
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,891
>> I GUESS SO.

804
00:19:51,891 --> 00:19:53,926
>> OKAY.

805
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,928
>> [sighs]

806
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:56,929
[dramatic music]

807
00:19:56,929 --> 00:20:04,971
*

808
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,675
I CAN'T BELIEVE JOEY'S

809
00:20:08,675 --> 00:20:10,142
TREATING ME LIKE THIS.

810
00:20:10,142 --> 00:20:11,711
I DECIDED TO PACK UP SOME THINGS

811
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,113
AND GO STAY AT MY MOM'S HOUSE.

812
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:15,014
>> WHAT HAPPENED?

813
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:15,882
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

814
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,417
>> EVERYBODY COMES BEFORE ME,

815
00:20:17,417 --> 00:20:19,886
IT FEELS LIKE, AND HE DOESN'T

816
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:21,854
SHOW ME ANY SORT OF AFFECTION OR

817
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:23,256
ATTENTION ANYMORE.

818
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:25,157
AND IT FEELS LIKE I'VE BEEN

819
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:26,158
DOING ALL THE WORK FOR

820
00:20:26,158 --> 00:20:26,826
THE HOUSING.

821
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:29,128
I WANTED US TO GET OUT ON OUR

822
00:20:29,128 --> 00:20:30,129
OWN SO WE COULD BE

823
00:20:30,129 --> 00:20:31,063
OUR OWN FAMILY.

824
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,099
LIKE, IT WAS OUR RESPONSIBILITY.

825
00:20:33,099 --> 00:20:33,900
>> I THINK THAT'S A GOOD

826
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,635
CONCEPT, THAT YOU WANT TO DO IT

827
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:38,338
ON YOUR OWN, BUT THE REALITY IS,

828
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:39,772
YOU NEED HELP.

829
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:40,807
AND I KNOW YOU WANT TO GET

830
00:20:40,807 --> 00:20:41,808
A BABY ROOM READY,

831
00:20:41,808 --> 00:20:42,542
AND YOU WANT...

832
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:43,776
>> YEAH.

833
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:45,278
>> IT'LL HAPPEN EVENTUALLY.

834
00:20:45,278 --> 00:20:46,879
MAYBE NOT IN KATIE TIME,

835
00:20:46,879 --> 00:20:48,281
BUT IT'LL HAPPEN.

836
00:20:48,281 --> 00:20:49,582
>> I WISH THE WHOLE WORLD WORKED

837
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:51,884
ON KATIE TIME, THOUGH.

838
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:54,220
>> SO WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING

839
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:55,021
ON DOING?

840
00:20:55,021 --> 00:20:56,723
>> I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT I'M

841
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:57,857
GONNA DO.

842
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:58,725
>> YOU GUYS BETTER MAKE

843
00:20:58,725 --> 00:20:59,526
A DECISION.

844
00:20:59,526 --> 00:21:02,028
THIS DOESN'T JUST AFFECT YOU AND

845
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:02,929
JOEY ANYMORE.

846
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:05,197
THERE'S A BABY INVOLVED.

847
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,199
>> I KNOW.

848
00:21:08,968 --> 00:21:10,970
AFTER A NIGHT APART, JOEY WANTED

849
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,972
TO MEET UP AND TALK.

850
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:24,384
>> I DON'T GET IT.

851
00:21:24,384 --> 00:21:25,284
>> WHAT DON'T YOU GET?

852
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,085
AND I'LL TRY TO EXPLAIN IT

853
00:21:26,085 --> 00:21:26,686
TO YOU.

854
00:21:26,686 --> 00:21:27,654
>> I DON'T GET WHAT I'M DOING

855
00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:28,321
SO [bleep] UP.

856
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:29,188
THAT'S WHAT I DON'T GET.

857
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:30,189
>> YOU COME HOME.

858
00:21:30,189 --> 00:21:31,924
YOU HARDLY SAY HI TO ME.

859
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:33,192
YOU GO DOWNSTAIRS.

860
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:34,126
YOU SHOWER.

861
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,127
YOU COME BACK UPSTAIRS.

862
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:35,928
YOU EAT.

863
00:21:35,928 --> 00:21:37,263
YOU SIT NEXT TO ME AND

864
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:38,398
DON'T SAY [bleep].

865
00:21:38,398 --> 00:21:39,432
I DON'T EVEN GET A,

866
00:21:39,432 --> 00:21:40,467
"HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

867
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:41,634
WHAT DID YOU DO TODAY?"

868
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:42,769
NOTHING.

869
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:44,671
IN THE SITUATION THAT WE'RE IN,

870
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:47,106
WHERE WOULD WE PUT THE BABY?

871
00:21:47,106 --> 00:21:48,307
>> UH, WHERE YOU GONNA PUT IT

872
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,442
NOW, THE TRUNK OF YOUR CAR?

873
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:50,577
>> THERE'S AN EXTRA ROOM

874
00:21:50,577 --> 00:21:51,378
IN MY MOM'S HOUSE.

875
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:52,912
MY MOM'S NOT GONNA LET ME AND

876
00:21:52,912 --> 00:21:55,081
THE BABY LIVE ON THE STREET.

877
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:55,882
>> WELL, THEN YOU GOT IT ALL--

878
00:21:55,882 --> 00:21:56,783
>> THAT'S JUST THE SITUATION

879
00:21:56,783 --> 00:21:57,717
THAT I WANT TO BE IN.

880
00:21:57,717 --> 00:21:59,318
>> WHY'D YOU GO?

881
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,220
>> I DON'T WANT TO FORCE

882
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:03,222
OUR FAMILY ON YOUR MOM.

883
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:04,424
>> JUST 'CAUSE WE'RE NOT OUT NOW

884
00:22:04,424 --> 00:22:05,392
DON'T MEAN WE'RE NOT GONNA MOVE

885
00:22:05,392 --> 00:22:06,292
OUT, AND IT DON'T MEAN WE'RE

886
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:07,026
GONNA BE THERE FOR FIVE

887
00:22:07,026 --> 00:22:07,727
MORE YEARS.

THINGS FROM OTHER PEOPLE WHEN

890
00:22:10,663 --> 00:22:14,367
I DON'T DO ANYTHING.

891
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:15,568
AND I FEEL BAD, BECAUSE THEY'RE

892
00:22:15,568 --> 00:22:18,505
SO--THEY DO EVERYTHING FOR US,

893
00:22:18,505 --> 00:22:19,839

894
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:22,875
GIVE TO THEM.

DO, KATIE.

00:29:36,308 --> 00:29:38,310
TAKE CONTROL, AT:

00:29:44,884 --> 00:29:45,852
>> [gasps]

1119
00:29:45,852 --> 00:29:47,854
OH, YEAH, IT'S COLD, HUH?

00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:53,826
>> [suckling]

1121
00:29:53,826 --> 00:29:54,827
>> SOUNDS LIKE SHE'S GIVING YOU

1122
00:29:54,827 --> 00:29:55,661
KISSES.

[smooching]

1124
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:56,996
>> YEAH.

1125
00:29:56,996 --> 00:29:58,664
SHE GIVES GOOD KISSES ALREADY.

1126
00:29:58,664 --> 00:30:00,332
>> [laughs]

1127
00:30:00,332 --> 00:30:01,300
>> ALL RIGHT.

1128
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:02,168
>> PUT HER IN THE CRADLE

1129
00:30:02,168 --> 00:30:03,269
NEXT TO OUR BED.

1130
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:04,570
>> I WAS GONNA SWADDLE HER.

1131
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:07,106
>> OH, YEAH.

1132
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:08,941
THIS THING IS HUGE FOR HER.

1133
00:30:08,941 --> 00:30:10,910
>> THERE WE GO.

1134
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:12,311
>> IT'S SO NICE TO HAVE MOLLI

1135
00:30:12,311 --> 00:30:14,246
HOME WITH US, AND JOEY EVEN

1136
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:15,781
REARRANGED THE BASEMENT SO WE'D

1137
00:30:15,781 --> 00:30:18,450
HAVE A LITTLE MORE SPACE.

1138
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,619
>> [crying]

1139
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:21,888
>> ARE YOU HUNGRY?

1140
00:30:21,888 --> 00:30:22,989
IS THAT WHAT'S WRONG?

1141
00:30:22,989 --> 00:30:25,324
[shushing]

1142
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:26,825
BUT IT'S STILL PRETTY CRAMPED,

1143
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,427
AND JOEY'S BROTHER AND SISTER

1144
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:30,396
ARE ALWAYS AROUND.

1145
00:30:30,396 --> 00:30:32,264
TODAY'S MY FIRST DAY OF ONLINE

1146
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:34,633
COMMUNITY COLLEGE CLASSES.

1147
00:30:34,633 --> 00:30:35,467
BE CAREFUL.

1148
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:37,136
BE GENTLE.

1149
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:38,037
SHE'S NAPPING.

1150
00:30:38,037 --> 00:30:39,005
>> BE CAREFUL, DESHAUN.

1151
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:40,439
BE CAREFUL ON HER HEAD.

1152
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:42,141
DESHAUN, BE CAREFUL ON HER HEAD.

1153
00:30:42,141 --> 00:30:42,975
SHE HAS SOFT SPOTS.

1154
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:44,410
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1155
00:30:44,410 --> 00:30:46,412
>> MY HOMEWORK.

1156
00:30:46,412 --> 00:30:47,779
>> ARE YOU EVER GONNA GO TO

1157
00:30:47,779 --> 00:30:48,948
A REAL COLLEGE?

1158
00:30:48,948 --> 00:30:49,781
YOU NEED TO BE GETTING SOME

1159
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:51,884
EDUCATION FROM REAL TEACHERS

1160
00:30:51,884 --> 00:30:53,119
AND NOT A COMPUTER.

1161
00:30:53,119 --> 00:30:54,020
>> I WAS GOING TO GO TO

1162
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,087
A REAL COLLEGE.

1163
00:30:55,087 --> 00:30:56,455
>> IN DENVER?

1164
00:30:56,455 --> 00:30:57,123
>> YUP.

1165
00:30:57,123 --> 00:31:00,192
AND THEN I HAD MOLLI INSTEAD.

1166
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:01,327
[shushing]

1167
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:02,861
STUDYING WITH A BABY IN THIS

1168
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:04,863
HOUSE IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY.

1169
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:08,434
BUT A COUPLE WEEKS LATER,

1170
00:31:08,434 --> 00:31:10,036
WE GOT SOME GOOD NEWS.

1171
00:31:10,036 --> 00:31:11,437
JOEY GOT HIRED AT THE MINES.

1172
00:31:11,437 --> 00:31:12,804
SO NOW WE CAN GO LOOK AT

1173
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:15,107
A PLACE WE CAN FINALLY AFFORD.

1174
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:15,774
>> [sighs]

1175
00:31:15,774 --> 00:31:16,442
WANT TO CHECK OUT

1176
00:31:16,442 --> 00:31:18,377
THE KITCHEN, MOLLY?

1177
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:19,378
YEAH, YOU WANT TO LOOK

1178
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,747
AT THE KITCHEN.

1179
00:31:21,747 --> 00:31:22,581
>> WELL, WE COULD PUT HER CRIB

1180
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:23,649
IN HERE.

1181
00:31:23,649 --> 00:31:25,217
>> I BET THE CRIB THAT WE HAVE

1182
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:26,518
IS TOO BIG.

1183
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:27,719
>> NOT REALLY.

1184
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,887
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1185
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,356
>> IF WE PUT IT THIS WAY.

1186
00:31:30,356 --> 00:31:31,190
>> WHAT, YOU MEAN THIS?

1187
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:31,890
>> YEAH.

1188
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,824
>> YEAH, BUT IT'S GONNA BE

1189
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:33,792
STICKING OUT.

1190
00:31:33,792 --> 00:31:34,793
>> WELL, I GUESS WE CAN ONLY

1191
00:31:34,793 --> 00:31:36,728
TELL BY THE--IF WE GET IT IN

1192
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:38,430
HERE OR MEASURE IT OR WHATEVER.

1193
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,966
>> THIS IS THE KITCHEN TABLE.

1194
00:31:39,966 --> 00:31:41,767
>> MM-HMM.

1195
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:44,136
LOOK AT THE CLOSET SPACE.

1196
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:46,638
THIS IS WHAT I NEED.

1197
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:47,339
>> YEAH?

1198
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:48,007
>> OH, YEAH.

1199
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:48,907
>> I THINK YOU NEED ABOUT FIVE

1200
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:49,741
OF THOSE.

1201
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:53,345
>> I LIKE IT SO FAR.

1202
00:31:53,345 --> 00:31:55,081
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1203
00:31:55,081 --> 00:31:55,948
>> I LIKE IT.

1204
00:31:55,948 --> 00:31:57,383
>> I THINK EVERYTHING WOULD FIT

1205
00:31:57,383 --> 00:31:58,384
IN HERE TOO.

1206
00:31:58,384 --> 00:32:00,019
>> YUP.

1207
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:01,453
>> IT'S PERFECT.

1208
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:03,022
WE APPLIED FOR THE APARTMENT

1209
00:32:03,022 --> 00:32:04,523
AND A FEW DAYS LATER, FOUND OUT

1210
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:07,226
WE GOT ACCEPTED.

1211
00:32:07,226 --> 00:32:08,460
>> MOLLI, I GOT YOU A SIPPY

1212
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:11,063
STRAW.

1213
00:32:11,063 --> 00:32:12,431
>> SHE'S LIKE, "WHAT THE HELL

1214
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:14,433
ARE YOU DOING?"

1215
00:32:20,406 --> 00:32:22,008
>> WE'RE SITTING ON A TUPPERWARE

1216
00:32:22,008 --> 00:32:23,142
LOOKING AT A HOUSE FULL OF

1217
00:32:23,142 --> 00:32:24,810
[bleep].

1218
00:32:24,810 --> 00:32:26,745
>> NOW WE CAN BE A FAMILY.

1219
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:27,879
>> YEAH.

1220
00:32:27,879 --> 00:32:29,215
I'M EXCITED.

1221
00:32:29,215 --> 00:32:31,217
I'M GLAD THAT WE'RE IN HERE.

1222
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,352
[chime dings]

1223
00:32:33,352 --> 00:32:34,620
>> THE NEW HOUSE IS GREAT FOR

1224
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:36,688
A COUPLE YEARS, BUT I STILL WANT

1225
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:37,856
US TO MOVE ON TO BIGGER AND

1226
00:32:37,856 --> 00:32:39,858
BETTER THINGS AS A FAMILY.

1227
00:32:42,061 --> 00:32:43,662
BECAUSE JOEY IS NEW AT THE

1228
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:45,397
MINES, HE HAS TO WORK THE NIGHT

1229
00:32:45,397 --> 00:32:47,166
SHIFT, WHICH MEANS HE SLEEPS FOR

1230
00:32:47,166 --> 00:32:48,934
MOST OF THE DAY WHILE I TAKE

1231
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:50,736
CARE OF MOLLI BY MYSELF.

1232
00:32:50,736 --> 00:32:52,138
JOEY.

1233
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:53,305
JOEY, YOU'RE GONNA BE LATE

1234
00:32:53,305 --> 00:32:55,374
FOR WORK.

1235
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:59,878
[baby crying]

1236
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,921
OKAY.

1237
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:10,722
I LOVE YOU.

1238
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:11,590
>> I LOVE YOU TOO.

1239
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,824
>> HAVE A GOOD NIGHT.

1240
00:33:12,824 --> 00:33:13,859
SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.

1241
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:17,263
>> SEE YOU IN THE MORNING, BABY.

1242
00:33:17,263 --> 00:33:18,564
>> BEING ON OUR OWN IS TURNING

1243
00:33:18,564 --> 00:33:19,731
OUT TO BE A LOT DIFFERENT

1244
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,533
THAN I EXPECTED.

1245
00:33:21,533 --> 00:33:23,535
JOEY'S JOB IS SUPER GRUELING,

1246
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:25,771
AND BEING ALONE ALL DAY SUCKS.

1247
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:27,073
SO I'M GLAD OUR ARRANGEMENT IS

1248
00:33:27,073 --> 00:33:28,874
JUST TEMPORARY UNTIL WE CAN MAKE

1249
00:33:28,874 --> 00:33:30,309
OUR MOVE TO DENVER.

1250
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:31,143
>> I'M HOME.

1251
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:32,844
>> SHE'S LIKE, "WHY DO YOU

1252
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,213
TORTURE ME?"

1253
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:35,947
>> [hiccupping and crying]

1254
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:37,216
>> WE'RE DONE. WE'RE DONE.

1255
00:33:37,216 --> 00:33:40,018
WE'RE DONE.

1256
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:40,919
>> ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA TAKE

1257
00:33:40,919 --> 00:33:43,355
A SHOWER, OKAY?

1258
00:33:43,355 --> 00:33:44,890
>> JOEY HAS TONIGHT OFF,

1259
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,258
SO MY MOM IS TAKING US OUT

1260
00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:47,893
TO DINNER SINCE SHE HASN'T SEEN

1261
00:33:47,893 --> 00:33:48,860
US IN A WHILE.

1262
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,895
>> SO WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO

1263
00:33:49,895 --> 00:33:50,962
TODAY?

1264
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:52,030
>> JUST SITTING AROUND PRETTY

1265
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,900
MUCH, BEING BORED.

1266
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,435
SO TWO YEARS FROM NOW,

1267
00:33:56,435 --> 00:33:58,904
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA SEE ME AGAIN.

1268
00:33:58,904 --> 00:34:00,672
>> WHY?

1269
00:34:00,672 --> 00:34:01,740
WHAT'S HAPPENING TWO YEARS

1270
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,808
FROM NOW?

1271
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:03,775
>> 'CAUSE WE'RE MOVING AWAY AND

1272
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:06,912
NEVER COMING BACK.

1273
00:34:06,912 --> 00:34:08,280
>> OH, REALLY?

1274
00:34:08,280 --> 00:34:09,248
WHERE ARE YOU PLANNING ON MOVING

1275
00:34:09,248 --> 00:34:10,349
AWAY TO?

1276
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:11,650
>> DENVER.

1277
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:12,851
>> AND WHAT COAL MINE IS JOEY

1278
00:34:12,851 --> 00:34:15,987
GONNA WORK IN IN DENVER?

1279
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:17,989
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1280
00:34:21,893 --> 00:34:22,628
>> I KNOW.

1281
00:34:22,628 --> 00:34:23,595
I WOULDN'T MAKE YOU LEAVE.

1282
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:24,496
THAT WOULD BE IRRESPONSIBLE FOR

1283
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:25,164
US TO MOVE.

1284
00:34:25,164 --> 00:34:25,964
>> WELL, AND I TOLD YOU, WHEN

1285
00:34:25,964 --> 00:34:26,798
THAT POINT COMES, IF YOU'RE

1286
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:27,799
PISSED OFF 'CAUSE WE CAN'T GO TO

1287
00:34:27,799 --> 00:34:28,634
COLORADO, I NEVER SAID YOU

1288
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:29,301
COULDN'T GO.

1289
00:34:29,301 --> 00:34:30,269
I JUST SAID I WASN'T GONNA GO

1290
00:34:30,269 --> 00:34:31,703
WITH YOU.

1291
00:34:31,703 --> 00:34:33,105
I'M NOT GONNA THROW AWAY ALL OF

1292
00:34:33,105 --> 00:34:33,972
THOSE BENEFITS AND THAT MUCH

1293
00:34:33,972 --> 00:34:35,607
MONEY FOR YOU TO GO COLLEGE WHEN

1294
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:36,475
YOU DON'T NEED TO GO

1295
00:34:36,475 --> 00:34:37,643
TO COLLEGE.

1296
00:34:37,643 --> 00:34:38,744
>> I DO NEED TO GO.

1297
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:39,745
>> I WOULD SAY I DON'T AGREE

1298
00:34:39,745 --> 00:34:40,912
THAT SHE DOESN'T NEED TO GO TO

1299
00:34:40,912 --> 00:34:41,780
COLLEGE, BUT--

00:39:57,796 --> 00:39:59,164
WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON STUFF.

1482
00:39:59,164 --> 00:40:01,066
WE STILL FIGHT, BY ALL MEANS,

1483
00:40:01,066 --> 00:40:03,535
BUT IT'S NOT AS BAD AS BEFORE.

1484
00:40:03,535 --> 00:40:05,537
OH, NO, MY NOODLES STUCK

1485
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:06,337
TOGETHER.

1486
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:09,274
>> WHAT IS THIS?

1487
00:40:09,274 --> 00:40:12,377
>> SPINACH AND TORTELLINI SALAD.

1488
00:40:12,377 --> 00:40:14,813
>> [chuckles]

1489
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:17,516
>> JOEY WORKS HIS HARDEST TO

1490
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:19,217
GIVE ME AND MOLLI WHATEVER

1491
00:40:19,217 --> 00:40:21,052
WE NEED.

1492
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:22,788
>> [crying]

1493
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:24,823
>> HE IS AN AMAZING DAD.

1494
00:40:24,823 --> 00:40:28,159
>> WHAT DID YOU DO?

1495
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:29,495
[chuckles]

1496
00:40:29,495 --> 00:40:31,329
I WISH WE COULD SPEND MORE TIME

1497
00:40:31,329 --> 00:40:32,263
TOGETHER.

1498
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,331
SET HER ON A PUMPKIN.

1499
00:40:33,331 --> 00:40:35,400
I WANT TO TAKE A PICTURE.

1500
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,202
>> [crying]

1501
00:40:37,202 --> 00:40:38,704
>> OKAY, YOU CAN PICK HER

1502
00:40:38,704 --> 00:40:40,772
BACK UP.

1503
00:40:40,772 --> 00:40:42,407
AT THIS POINT, IF WE CAN MOVE TO

1504
00:40:42,407 --> 00:40:44,442
COLORADO, THAT WOULD BE IDEAL.

1505
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,011
BUT IF JOEY CAN'T GET

1506
00:40:46,011 --> 00:40:47,178
TRANSFERRED, THEN WE CAN'T

1507
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:49,447
AFFORD NOT TO HAVE THE GOOD JOB

1508
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,617
THAT HE HAS RIGHT NOW.

1509
00:40:53,652 --> 00:40:55,286
SAY, "CHEESE, DAD."

1510
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,287
I DON'T WANT TO BE STUCK IN

1511
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:57,689
WYOMING FOREVER.

1512
00:40:57,689 --> 00:40:59,290
I KIND OF WANT TO EXPERIENCE

1513
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,892
SOMETHING BIGGER AND BETTER.

1514
00:41:00,892 --> 00:41:02,293
I WENT STRAIGHT FROM BEING

1515
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,295
A CHILD TO BEING AN ADULT.

1516
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:20,378
>> I HAVE TO TIPTOE AROUND

1517
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:21,079
MY SISTER.

1518
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:22,247
I DON'T WANT HER TO FEEL

1519
00:41:22,247 --> 00:41:23,381
DEPRESSED OR SAD.

1520
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:24,950
>> WHEN I GOT MY ABORTION,

1521
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:26,618
I KNEW WHAT I WAS DOING IT FOR.

1522
00:41:26,618 --> 00:41:27,586
>> I'M SORRY THAT YOU HAD TO GO

1523
00:41:27,586 --> 00:41:28,419
THROUGH THAT.

1524
00:41:28,419 --> 00:41:29,387
AND I'M SORRY THAT YOU HAVE TO

1525
00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:31,990
STAY HERE AND WATCH HER HAVE

1526
00:41:31,990 --> 00:41:33,358
HER BABY, AND YOU CAN'T.

1527
00:41:33,358 --> 00:41:34,059
>> I'M LEAVING.

1528
00:41:34,059 --> 00:41:34,793
I DON'T WANT TO BE IN

1529
00:41:34,793 --> 00:41:36,762
THIS [bleep] HOUSE.
