00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,042
HI, I'M TAYLOR.

5
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:09,743
AND I'M FROM CINCINNATI, OHIO.

00:00:09,743 --> 00:00:11,579
KAYLEE, THEY'RE BROKEN.

7
00:00:11,579 --> 00:00:12,746
I'M 15 YEARS OLD NOW,

8
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:13,747
BUT ONE DAY, I WANT TO GO

9
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:15,616
TO COLLEGE AND BECOME A NURSE.

10
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:16,617
I LIVE WITH MY MOM,

11
00:00:16,617 --> 00:00:17,618
AND WE'RE REALLY CLOSE.

12
00:00:17,618 --> 00:00:18,452
>> OH, MY GOD.

13
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:20,121
THAT WAS HYSTERICAL.

14
00:00:20,121 --> 00:00:20,988
>> IT'S BEEN THAT WAY SINCE

15
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:22,856
MY DAD LEFT WHEN I WAS YOUNGER.

16
00:00:22,856 --> 00:00:23,724
LIKE, I DON'T HAVE TOO MANY

THE STREET WITH HER FAMILY,

20
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:28,462
AND WE SPEND AS MUCH TIME

21
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:29,630
TOGETHER AS POSSIBLE.

22
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,799
>> BINGO!

23
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:32,666
>> BUT THEN I MET MY BOYFRIEND,

24
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:33,834
NATHAN, AT A ROLLER-SKATING

25
00:00:33,834 --> 00:00:35,169
PARTY, AND WE BECAME

26
00:00:35,169 --> 00:00:36,504
INSEPARABLE.

27
00:00:36,504 --> 00:00:38,339
NATHAN AND I BOTH LOVE SPORTS

28
00:00:38,339 --> 00:00:39,340

30
00:00:40,141 --> 00:00:40,808
THAT WAS FUN.

31
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:41,642
WE SHOULD DO THAT AGAIN

32
00:00:41,642 --> 00:00:42,710
NEXT WEEKEND.

33
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,611
EVEN THOUGH HE'S A YEAR OLDER

00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:44,712
THAN ME, WE STILL GO

35
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:46,380
TO THE SAME SCHOOL TOGETHER.

00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,881
NATHAN GREW UP WITHOUT A DAD TOO

00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,083
BUT IS CLOSE WITH HIS MOM,

00:00:49,083 --> 00:00:49,750

>> YEAH.

41
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:52,019
>> MY MOM THINKS WE'RE TOO YOUNG

42
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:53,654
TO BE IN A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP,

43
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:54,988
BUT SHE'S GONNA HAVE TO GET

44
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:56,324
OVER IT, BECAUSE...

[chime dings]

46
00:00:57,325 --> 00:00:59,260

YOU READY FOR THIS?

48
00:01:06,667 --> 00:01:07,501
THIS IS MICHAEL JORDAN

00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:09,170
RIGHT HERE.

50
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,070
OH!

00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:11,572
IT'S SUMMERTIME, SO NATHAN

52
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:12,906
AND I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO HANG OUT

53
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:14,142
A LOT MORE LATELY.

"MY GIRLFRIEND BEAT ME

WE ONLY LIVE A FEW BLOCKS AWAY

57
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:18,646
FROM EACH OTHER, WHICH IS A GOOD

58
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:20,314
THING, BECAUSE NEITHER ONE OF US

59
00:01:20,314 --> 00:01:21,649
IS OLD ENOUGH TO DRIVE YET.

60
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:22,650
WHAT DID WE DO WHEN WE FIRST

61
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,984
STARTED DATING, LIKE...

62
00:01:23,984 --> 00:01:24,985
>> SKATING RINK.

63
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:26,320
WENT OUT DANCING OR SOMETHING.

64
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,156
>> YEAH, WE WERE DANCING.

65
00:01:28,156 --> 00:01:29,323
YOU WERE DOING SOME WEIRD MOVE,

66
00:01:29,323 --> 00:01:30,658
AND ME AND LEXI HAD NEVER SEEN

67
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:31,492
IT BEFORE.

68
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:32,493
WE WERE LIKE, "OH, MY GOODNESS,

00:01:32,493 --> 00:01:33,494
THAT'S SO COOL."

70
00:01:33,494 --> 00:01:34,162
YOU WERE JUST, LIKE,

71
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:35,163
ON THE GROUND AND, LIKE,

72
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:35,863
VIBRATING.

73
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:36,530
I DON'T KNOW.

74
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,198
IT WAS WEIRD.

75
00:01:37,198 --> 00:01:37,965
>> AND LOOK WHAT ALL THAT

76
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:39,032

>> YEAH.

78
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,534
>> HAVING A BABY NOW.

00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:41,535
LET'S MAKE THE BABY SHOOT IT.

00:01:41,535 --> 00:01:42,436
>> NO.

81
00:01:42,436 --> 00:01:43,937
>> POP IT OFF YOUR BELLY.

82
00:01:43,937 --> 00:01:45,439
>> YOU WANT TO GO FOR A WALK?

83
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,308
>> I GUESS.

84
00:01:47,308 --> 00:01:48,142
>> THIS SUMMER HAS BEEN, LIKE,

85
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:49,143
BEEN KIND OF BORING, THOUGH,

86
00:01:49,143 --> 00:01:50,110
JUST 'CAUSE WE CAN'T--

87
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:50,811
>> 'CAUSE NOW THAT

90
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:53,447
I COULD, BUT I CHOOSE

91
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:55,349
TO STAY HOME WITH YOU.

BUT I'M GLAD NATHAN IS STICKING

95
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,555
BY ME.

96
00:02:01,555 --> 00:02:02,890
AND NOW THAT I'M SHOWING,

97
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,225
IT'S ALL MY FRIENDS WANT

98
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:06,294
TO TALK ABOUT.

99
00:02:06,294 --> 00:02:07,795
>> WHAT DID YOU DO WHEN YOU

100
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:09,297
FOUND OUT YOU WERE PREGNANT?

>> UH...

102
00:02:11,131 --> 00:02:13,133
I TOOK THE PREGNANCY TEST,

103
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,302
AND THEN IT SAID POSITIVE,

104
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:15,436
AND THEN I CALLED NATHAN

105
00:02:15,436 --> 00:02:17,405
AND TOLD HIM.

106
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:18,239
HE WAS LIKE, "WHOA,

107
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:18,972
I'M GONNA BE A DAD.

108
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:19,673
LET'S GO SHOPPING.

109
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:20,408
LET'S TELL MY MOM."

110
00:02:20,408 --> 00:02:21,141
I WAS LIKE, "NO!

111
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:21,975
DON'T TELL ANYBODY.

112
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,777
KEEP IT A SECRET."

113
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:24,778
I WAS KIND OF, LIKE, IN AWE,

114
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:26,280
LIKE, JUST STRUCK BY IT.

115
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,781
LIKE...[gasps]

116
00:02:27,781 --> 00:02:29,183
"I HAVE TO TELL MY MOM."

117
00:02:29,183 --> 00:02:30,518
I WAS LIKE, "NO, NO, NO,

118
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:31,685
I CAN FAKE IT FOR A WHILE."

119
00:02:31,685 --> 00:02:33,521
SO I THOUGHT OF PUTTING, LIKE,

120
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:34,688
FOOD COLORING ON, LIKE,

121
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,190
TAMPONS OR SOMETHING,

122
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,525
SO SHE WOULD THINK THAT I WAS,

123
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:39,159
LIKE, HAVING MY PERIOD.

124
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,160
I WAS THINKING UP A LOT

125
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,429
OF CRAZY THINGS.

126
00:02:41,429 --> 00:02:42,563
>> SO I'M GUESSING YOUR MOM

127
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:46,434
WASN'T REALLY HAPPY ABOUT IT.

128
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:49,237
>> NO, SHE WASN'T HAPPY AT ALL.

129
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:51,071
IN FACT, MY MOM WAS REALLY UPSET

130
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:52,105
WHEN SHE FOUND OUT I WAS

131
00:02:52,105 --> 00:02:53,774
PREGNANT, BECAUSE BEFORE SHE

132
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:55,943
HAD ME, SHE GOT PREGNANT AT 17

133
00:02:55,943 --> 00:02:57,578
BUT CHOSE ADOPTION.

134
00:02:57,578 --> 00:02:59,079
I WANT ME SOME COCOA PUFFS.

135
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:00,448
AND NOW SHE'S CONCERNED THAT

136
00:03:00,448 --> 00:03:01,649
WE WON'T BE ABLE TO HANDLE

137
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:02,650

138
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:03,884
>> THIS IS A BIG BOWL.

>> THAT'S A TROUGH.

140
00:03:04,718 --> 00:03:05,986
THAT'S NOT A BOWL.

141
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,656
>> WHAT'S A TROUGH?

142
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:11,124
>> IT LOOKS LIKE A BOWL TO ME.

143
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,125
>> I WORRY ABOUT YOU.

144
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,961
I WORRY ABOUT THE FINANCIAL PART

145
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:14,795
OF IT.

00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,003
A CHILD UP FOR ADOPTION.

151
00:03:23,003 --> 00:03:24,004
I KNEW THAT I COULDN'T TAKE CARE

152
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:26,139
OF A CHILD AT A YOUNG AGE.

153
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,809
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU

154
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,478
GIVE THE CHILD UP FOR ADOPTION.

155
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:31,312
I JUST--

156
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:32,313
>> SHE'S GOT THAT LOOK.

157
00:03:32,313 --> 00:03:32,980
>> I KNOW.

158
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:33,814
IT'S THERE EVERY TIME.

159
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:34,782
>> YOU KNOW WHAT SHE'S THINKING.

160
00:03:34,782 --> 00:03:35,583
>> SHE PUTS THAT WALL UP.

161
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,417
>> YOU'RE MAKING ME MAD.

162
00:03:36,417 --> 00:03:37,518
>> I JUST DON'T WANT YOU

163
00:03:37,518 --> 00:03:39,287
TO HAVE TO STRUGGLE.

164
00:03:39,287 --> 00:03:40,120
YOU SEE WHAT I GO THROUGH

165
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,789
AS A SINGLE MOM.

166
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:43,791
>> I JUST DON'T LIKE THE IDEA

167
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,025
OF ADOPTION.

168
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,193
>> I JUST CAN'T STAND THE IDEA

169
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:48,028
OF, LIKE, HOW MY DAD LEFT,

170
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:49,863
AND I WOULDN'T WANT TO DO THAT

171
00:03:49,863 --> 00:03:50,831
TO MY CHILD.

172
00:03:50,831 --> 00:03:52,165
>> YOU SAY NOW THAT YOU'RE GONNA

173
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:53,834
BE WITH HER, BUT YOU ALL GROW

174
00:03:53,834 --> 00:03:55,503
UP, AND YOUR FEELINGS CHANGE.

175
00:03:55,503 --> 00:03:56,837
THEN THAT RESENTMENT STARTS

176
00:03:56,837 --> 00:03:58,005
COMING IN, AND THEN YOU ALL

177
00:03:58,005 --> 00:03:59,006
START FIGHTING, AND THEN

178
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:01,642
YOU BREAK UP.

179
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:02,676
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT ABOUT

180
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:03,477
YOU ANYMORE.

181
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:07,080
IT'S ABOUT THE LITTLE BABY.

182
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,116
>> I KNOW IT'S ABOUT THE BABY,

183
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:10,117
BUT I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO

184
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:11,819
CHOOSE ADOPTION.

185
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:12,820
WE'RE HAVING A GIRL,

186
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,954
AND I WANT HER TO GROW UP WITH

187
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:15,623
ME AND NATHAN AS HER PARENTS.

188
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:17,691
>> I LIKE THIS ONE.

189
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:18,859
>> SO I NEED TO MAKE SURE NATHAN

190
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:21,395
REALLY WILL BE THERE FOR US.

191
00:04:21,395 --> 00:04:22,696
I WAS A HUGE DADDY'S GIRL,

192
00:04:22,696 --> 00:04:26,033
AND THEN, LIKE, HE QUIT, LIKE,

193
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,200
BEING THERE.

194
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,702
HE WOULD JUST PROMISE THINGS,

195
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:30,704
AND IT WOULD JUST BREAK MY HEART

196
00:04:30,704 --> 00:04:31,539
WHEN HE WOULDN'T DO IT,

197
00:04:31,539 --> 00:04:32,873
'CAUSE I LOVED MY DAD SO MUCH,

198
00:04:32,873 --> 00:04:35,042
AND, LIKE, I DON'T WANT HER

199
00:04:35,042 --> 00:04:37,478
TO BE LIKE ME TOWARDS MY DAD.

200
00:04:37,478 --> 00:04:38,812
>> WELL, I COULDN'T STAND

201
00:04:38,812 --> 00:04:40,648
ANOTHER IDEA OF SOMEONE ELSE

202
00:04:40,648 --> 00:04:42,616
BEING CALLED "DAD" BY MY KID,

203
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:43,951
AND I DON'T BELIEVE IN ADOPTION,

204
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:45,285
ABORTION.

205
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,620
I BELIEVE IN THE BABY BEING WITH

206
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,122
THEIR BLOOD PARENTS.

207
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,791
I'D GIVE HER WHAT ALL SHE WANTS,

208
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:51,792
'CAUSE SHE'S DADDY'S LITTLE

209
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:52,326
GIRL.

210
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:52,993
>> [laughs]

211
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:55,195
>> SPOIL HER ROTTEN.

212
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:58,532
SHE ONLY KICKS WHEN I TOUCH HER.

213
00:04:58,532 --> 00:04:59,867
>> I'M RELIEVED NATHAN AGREES

214
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:01,369
AND WANTS TO KEEP THE BABY.

215
00:05:01,369 --> 00:05:04,104
I'M SCARED TO TELL MY MOM,

216
00:05:04,104 --> 00:05:05,105
BUT I'M GLAD AT LEAST NATHAN'S

217
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:07,107
MOM SUPPORTS US.

218
00:05:07,107 --> 00:05:08,442
>> I'M NOT FOR ADOPTION

219
00:05:08,442 --> 00:05:10,110
BECAUSE I THINK FAMILIES SHOULD

220
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:11,211
STICK TOGETHER.

221
00:05:11,211 --> 00:05:12,546
THE BABY DOES NEED BOTH

222
00:05:12,546 --> 00:05:14,448
ITS PARENTS IN ITS LIFE.

223
00:05:14,448 --> 00:05:15,282
AND IT WILL BE HARD,

224
00:05:15,282 --> 00:05:16,450
I MEAN, 'CAUSE YOU GUYS

225
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:17,685
WILL GET STRESSED.

226
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:19,286
>> JUST GOT TO FIGURE IT OUT.

227
00:05:19,286 --> 00:05:20,954
>> JUST TALKING ABOUT IT WITHOUT

228
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:22,122
GETTING IN A FIGHT, I THINK,

229
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:23,957
IT HELPED ALREADY.

230
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:25,459
>> HAVE FUN.

231
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,395
>> THANK YOU.

232
00:05:31,399 --> 00:05:32,099
>> WATCH YOUR FEET.

233
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:33,434
>> OH...GIVE ME YOUR HANDS.

234
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:34,267
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME FALL.

235
00:05:34,267 --> 00:05:35,603
YOU'RE MAKING ME NERVOUS.

236
00:05:35,603 --> 00:05:36,604
[laughs]

237
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:37,605
I CAN'T REMEMBER HOW TO SKATE,

238
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:38,606
'CAUSE I HAVEN'T SKATED

239
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:39,607
IN FOREVER.

240
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:41,842
I FEEL LIKE A LITTLE KID.

241
00:05:41,842 --> 00:05:43,744
WHOA!

242
00:05:43,744 --> 00:05:44,745
THINGS WITH ME AND NATHAN

243
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:46,013
HAVE BEEN REALLY GOOD,

244
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:46,847
AND I THINK WE'LL MAKE IT

245
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,149
TOGETHER AS PARENTS.

246
00:05:49,149 --> 00:05:49,817
>> I LOVE YOU.

247
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:50,618
>> I LOVE YOU.

248
00:05:50,618 --> 00:05:52,853
[laughter]

249
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:53,854
NOW THAT I'M DEFINITELY

250
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,188
KEEPING THE BABY, I NEED

251
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,123
TO TELL MY MOM.

252
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:57,791
I JUST HOPE SHE UNDERSTANDS

253
00:05:57,791 --> 00:05:58,792
HOW I FEEL.

254
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,829
I GUESS I JUST FEEL I CAN DO IT.

255
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,664
EVEN THOUGH I RESENT THAT

256
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:05,165
I CAN'T DO SOME OF THE THINGS

257
00:06:05,165 --> 00:06:06,834
I'D RATHER BE DOING AS

258
00:06:06,834 --> 00:06:09,169
A TEENAGER, I THINK THE BETTER

259
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:12,773
OPTION IS TO KEEP HER.

260
00:06:12,773 --> 00:06:14,775
>> YOU'RE JUST SO YOUNG.

261
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:17,277
YOU DON'T REALIZE--

262
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:18,111
HOW ARE YOU GONNA CLOTHE HER?

263
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,079
HOW ARE YOU GONNA BUY DIAPERS?

264
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:21,915
THE CRYING AND THE UP ALL NIGHT,

265
00:06:21,915 --> 00:06:23,083
GOING TO SCHOOL.

266
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,084
YOU GUYS CAN'T EVEN GET JOBS

267
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:24,918
YET.

268
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,754
IT'S GONNA BE HARD.

269
00:06:26,754 --> 00:06:28,422
SO THEN THE BURDEN OF THIS

270
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:30,924
FALLS ON ME, WHICH I'M ALREADY

271
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,426
STRETCHED TO THE LIMIT.

272
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:34,595
YOU KNOW, WHAT DO I DO?

273
00:06:34,595 --> 00:06:35,429
AND ADOPTIONS AREN'T LIKE

274
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:36,430
THEY USED TO BE, WHERE,

275
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,765
YOU KNOW, YOU JUST GAVE IT AWAY

276
00:06:37,765 --> 00:06:38,766
AND NEVER SAW IT AGAIN.

277
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:40,501
YOU CAN HAVE OPEN ADOPTIONS.

278
00:06:40,501 --> 00:06:42,002
>> IT'S MY KID;

279
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,403
IT'S NOT THEIRS.

280
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:46,674
LIKE, THEY'LL BE ABLE TO SEE HER

281
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:49,009
GO THROUGH, LIKE,

282
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:50,010
OH, FIRST STEPS.

283
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:50,844
OH, FIRST SMILE.

284
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:51,845
OH, SHE CUT HER HAIR.

285
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:55,516
OH, SHE FELL DOWN THE STAIRS.

286
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:56,684
NO, THAT'S NOT THEIR JOB.

287
00:06:56,684 --> 00:06:58,919
IT'S MINE.

288
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:03,657
>> [sniffles]

289
00:07:03,657 --> 00:07:04,525
I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE TO

290
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:05,893
STRUGGLE.

291
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:07,895
I DON'T.

292
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:09,229
AND I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE HARD

293
00:07:09,229 --> 00:07:11,331
FOR YOU.

294
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:14,735
[chime dings]

295
00:07:14,735 --> 00:07:15,569
>> I KNOW IT'S NOT GONNA

296
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:17,237
BE EASY, BUT I WANT TO RAISE

297
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:18,572
MY OWN BABY.

298
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:19,740
I JUST HOPE MY MOM WILL SUPPORT

299
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:21,675
MY DECISION.

300
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:31,785
>> HELLO?

301
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:32,786
>> HI.

302
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:33,787
>> I'M GLAD NATHAN AND I

303
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:34,788
ARE KEEPING THE BABY,

304
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:35,956
AND I THINK MY MOM IS STARTING

305
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:37,491
TO ACCEPT OUR DECISION,

306
00:07:37,491 --> 00:07:38,659
BUT SHE AND MY SISTER WANT

307
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,360
TO HAVE A TALK WITH US.

308
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,862
>> HOW DO YOU FEEL TODAY?

309
00:07:41,862 --> 00:07:42,696
>> PREGNANT.

310
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:43,664
>> PREGNANT.

311
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,365
>> YEAH.

312
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:46,333
>> YOU GONNA BE THAT WAY FOR

313
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:47,835
A WHILE?

314
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:48,836
>> I THINK EVERY POUND I GAIN,

315
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:50,003
YOU GAIN THREE TIMES THAT.

316
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:50,838
>> I KNOW, I HAVE BEEN.

317
00:07:50,838 --> 00:07:51,672
I'VE BEEN GAINING.

318
00:07:51,672 --> 00:07:53,173
EVERY TIME SHE DOES, I GAIN.

319
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:54,508
>> SYMPATHY POUNDS.

320
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:55,909
>> I DON'T KNOW. I HAVE BEEN.

321
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:57,911
>> I REMEMBER WHEN I FOUND OUT

322
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:58,946
YOU WERE PREGNANT.

323
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:00,447
I MEAN, YOU OBVIOUSLY WANTED HER

324
00:08:00,447 --> 00:08:01,582
TO GIVE IT UP FOR ADOPTION.

325
00:08:01,582 --> 00:08:04,451
BUT I THINK HAVING A STRANGER

326
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,286
RAISE THE BABY WOULD BE HARD

327
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:08,121
FOR YOU, AND IT WAS MORE

328
00:08:08,121 --> 00:08:09,757
MOM'S DECISION THAN YOURS.

329
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:10,423
>> I WASN'T--

330
00:08:10,423 --> 00:08:11,291
>> I'M NOT ALLOWED TO MAKE

331
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,159
THAT DECISION FOR HER BY LAW,

332
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:13,994
THOUGH, EVEN THOUGH SHE IS

333
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:14,962
A MINOR.

334
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:16,129
>> WELL, COMPARED TO OTHER

335
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:17,631
PEOPLE IN THIS WORLD, I THINK

336
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:19,132
I'D DO A LOT BETTER THAN

337
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:19,800
MOST OF THE PEOPLE.

338
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,601
>> I'M SURE YOU WOULD.

339
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:21,334
I DON'T DOUBT THAT--

340
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:22,302
>> I DON'T THINK THAT YOU WILL

341
00:08:22,302 --> 00:08:23,136
DO A BAD JOB.

342
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:24,004
I JUST THINK IT'S GONNA TAKE

343
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:24,972
A LOT OF YOUR OWN HAPPINESS

344
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:25,973
AWAY.

345
00:08:25,973 --> 00:08:27,307
IT'S A CONSTANT, 24-7.

346
00:08:27,307 --> 00:08:29,142
THERE'S REALLY NEVER A BREAK

347
00:08:29,142 --> 00:08:30,944
IN THE BEGINNING OF THIS.

348
00:08:30,944 --> 00:08:31,779
THERE'S BOTTLE WASHING,

349
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:33,947
THE LAUNDRY, THE DIAPERS.

350
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:34,948
YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO

351
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:38,285
GET AT LEAST A PART-TIME JOB.

352
00:08:38,285 --> 00:08:39,887
>> AND SHE LOOKS AT ME.

353
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:41,589
>> I CAN'T EVEN GET A JOB YET.

354
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:45,092
I'M NOT OLD ENOUGH.

355
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:48,261
>> THIS ONE LIVING BEING

356
00:08:48,261 --> 00:08:50,463
IS COMPLETELY DEPENDENT ON YOU.

357
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:52,633
I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE

358
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:53,801
A RUDE AWAKENING WHEN IT FINALLY

359
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:55,135
GETS HERE.

360
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:58,471
BETTER START PREPARING NOW.

361
00:08:58,471 --> 00:08:59,472
>> MY SISTER IS RIGHT.

362
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:00,641
I'M DUE IN TEN WEEKS,

363
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:02,075
SO WE REALLY NEED TO FIGURE OUT

364
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:02,910
HOW WE'RE GONNA GET READY

365
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,977
FOR THIS BABY.

366
00:09:03,977 --> 00:09:06,313
WE'RE NAMING HER AUBRI,

367
00:09:06,313 --> 00:09:08,148
BUT THAT'S ABOUT ALL WE KNOW.

368
00:09:08,148 --> 00:09:09,983
NOW THAT WE'RE GONNA KEEP HER,

369
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:11,384
WHAT'S THE PLAN?

370
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,052
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK

371
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,420
THE PLAN IS?

372
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,121
>> I DON'T KNOW.

373
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:15,088
THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING YOU.

374
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:16,924

00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,032
GONNA MAKE THEIR, LIKE, LITTLE,

562
00:14:25,032 --> 00:14:27,034
"I TOLD YOU SO," LITTLE

563
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:29,569
DRAMA-MAKING REACTIONS.

564
00:14:29,569 --> 00:14:30,737
WHATEVER.

565
00:14:30,737 --> 00:14:32,372
IF SOMEONE CALLS ME FAT, THOUGH,

566
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:33,206
THAT'S A DIFFERENT STORY.

567
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,207
>> YEAH.

568
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,208
THAT WOULDN'T BE COOL.

569
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,044
>> IT'S ON AFTER THAT.

570
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:38,878
BUT I'M JUST KIND OF EXCITED

571
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:40,047
JUST SO I CAN GET OUT OF THE

572
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:42,815
HOUSE AND JUST SEE PEOPLE.

573
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:43,650
>> WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO

574
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,651
WHEN SHE'S BORN?

575
00:14:44,651 --> 00:14:45,485
ARE YOU GONNA STAY IN SCHOOL

576
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:46,219
OR...

577
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:47,654
>> UH, I WANT TO TRY AND KEEP

578
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:49,322
DOING SCHOOL, BUT I DON'T KNOW

579
00:14:49,322 --> 00:14:51,224
IF I'LL BE ABLE TO,

580
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,059
JUST 'CAUSE ME AND NATHAN

581
00:14:52,059 --> 00:14:54,227
CAN'T AFFORD, LIKE, A DAY CARE

582
00:14:54,227 --> 00:14:55,295
OR BABYSITTER OR ANYTHING.

583
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:56,163
IF I CAN'T STAY IN SCHOOL,

584
00:14:56,163 --> 00:14:57,330
I GUESS I'M GONNA HAVE TO DO

585
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,166
VIRTUAL SCHOOL, BUT I REALLY

586
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:00,133
DON'T WANT TO.

587
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:01,134
>> WHAT EXACTLY IS VIRTUAL

588
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:02,569
SCHOOL?

589
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:03,903
>> IT'S WHERE YOU DO SCHOOLWORK

590
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,572
AT HOME, BUT YOU STILL GET,

591
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:06,974
LIKE, YOUR CREDITS AND STUFF.

592
00:15:06,974 --> 00:15:08,608
YOU JUST DO IT ON A COMPUTER.

593
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:11,111
KIND OF BE BORING, THOUGH.

594
00:15:11,111 --> 00:15:12,112
>> YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU DON'T GET

595
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:12,980
OUT OF THE HOUSE.

596
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:13,981
>> YEAH, LIKE, YOU CAN'T REALLY

597
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:15,515
HAVE ANY--MUCH FUN.

598
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:16,683
SO I'M GONNA TRY REALLY, REALLY

599
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:19,552
HARD TO DO REGULAR SCHOOL.

600
00:15:24,657 --> 00:15:26,526
SCHOOL STARTS TODAY, AND NATHAN

601
00:15:26,526 --> 00:15:28,361
IS COMING OVER SO MY MOM

602
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:30,797
CAN DRIVE US IN TOGETHER.

603
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:32,799
>> YOU LOOK GORGEOUS.

604
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:35,302
>> IT'S FREEZING.

605
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:43,410
I'M GETTING TOO FAT TO WALK

606
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:47,414
AND FIT IN MY CLOTHES.

607
00:15:47,414 --> 00:15:49,916
FIRST PERSON TO TOUCH MY STOMACH

608
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:50,750
IS GETTING SMACKED.

609
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:51,784
>> YOU KNOW PEOPLE ARE GONNA

610
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,785
TOUCH YOUR STOMACH, SO DON'T BE

611
00:15:52,785 --> 00:15:53,786
OFFENDED BY IT AND DON'T GET

612
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,787
GROUCHY ABOUT IT.

613
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,623
JUST SMILE AND LET THEM DO IT.

614
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:57,524
>> I'LL MAKE YOU FEEL BETTER.

615
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:58,391
I'LL LET THEM TOUCH MY BABY

616
00:15:58,391 --> 00:15:59,426
IN THE BELLY.

617
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:00,927
>> OKAY, GUYS, SO I GUESS

618
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:02,362
THIS IS IT.

619
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,297

622
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,638
FRIENDS AND BE BACK IN CLASS.

623
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:12,972
I'M ALREADY EXCITED TO COME

624
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,274
BACK AFTER THE BABY IS BORN

625
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:15,442
SO I CAN ACTUALLY ENJOY

626
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:16,276
HIGH SCHOOL WITHOUT BEING

627
00:16:16,276 --> 00:16:17,777
PREGNANT.

628
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:18,978
BUT WITHOUT A BABYSITTER,

629
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:20,280
IT MIGHT BE HARD TO CONVINCE

630
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,448
MY MOM THAT THIS IS THE BEST

631
00:16:21,448 --> 00:16:23,116
PLAN.

632
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,284
>> HOW MANY PEOPLE RUBBED

633
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:25,118
YOUR BELLY?

634
00:16:25,118 --> 00:16:26,453
>> NOBODY, NO.

635
00:16:26,453 --> 00:16:28,021
>> OH.

636
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:29,522
THAT'S SURPRISING.

637
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:32,525
WE NEED TO SIT DOWN AND SEE HOW

638
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:33,693
WE'RE GONNA WORK THIS SCHEDULE

639
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:35,862
OUT, AS TO HOW YOU ALL ARE GONNA

640
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:38,065
WORK IT WHEN THE BABY COMES.

641
00:16:38,065 --> 00:16:38,898
YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

642
00:16:38,898 --> 00:16:39,999
THAT VIRTUAL SCHOOL, DON'T YOU,

643
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:40,633
NATHAN?

644
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:41,301
>> YEAH.

645
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:42,835
>> HOW DOES THAT WORK?

646
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,604
>> YOU DO WORK ON A COMPUTER.

647
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:45,605
>> I DON'T REALLY WANT

648
00:16:45,605 --> 00:16:46,773
TO DO THAT.

649
00:16:46,773 --> 00:16:47,774
>> BUT YOU GOT TO THINK,

650
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:48,775
WHO'S GONNA WATCH THAT KID

651
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:51,144
DURING THE DAY?

652
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:53,146
>> I KNOW, BUT IT'S GONNA BE

653
00:16:53,146 --> 00:16:54,814

655
00:16:55,815 --> 00:16:58,418
ON THE COMPUTER FOR THREE HOURS.

656
00:17:07,026 --> 00:17:08,528
LATER THAT WEEK, WE MET UP

657
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:09,862
WITH NATHAN AND HIS MOM TO MAKE

658
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:10,863
A PLAN FOR WHEN THE BABY

659
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:11,964
IS BORN.

660
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,100
>> I THOUGHT MAYBE EVERY OTHER

661
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,967
NIGHT, HE COULD COME OVER

662
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,136
AND HELP HER.

663
00:17:16,136 --> 00:17:16,836
>> I MEAN, THAT SEEMS

664
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:17,804
PRETTY REASONABLE.

665
00:17:17,804 --> 00:17:18,971
>> BUT I'M JUST REALLY CONCERNED

666

AT THAT TIME FRAME THAT THEY'RE

667
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:22,442
IN SCHOOL, THAT WE DON'T HAVE

668
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:25,278
A GOOD BABYSITTER TO GIVE THEM.

669
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:27,114
I WORK 9:30 AT NIGHT UNTIL

670
00:17:27,114 --> 00:17:29,182
5:30 IN THE MORNING.

671
00:17:29,182 --> 00:17:30,683
>> I WORK 6:00 IN THE MORNING

672
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:32,985
TILL 2:00 IN THE AFTERNOON.

673

OUR PROBLEM LIES.

675
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:38,057
THAT'S THE PART I'M AFRAID OF.

676
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:39,392
IT'S GONNA MEAN THAT ONE OF THEM

677
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:43,996
HAS TO SACRIFICE.

678
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,998
>> OBVIOUSLY, NEITHER OF US

679
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:47,800
WANT TO DO VIRTUAL, BUT...

680

>> I'D RATHER YOU DO THE

681
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:53,306
VIRTUAL, AND I COULD STICK

682
00:17:53,306 --> 00:17:54,741
TO SCHOOL.

683
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:55,642
>> THAT'S NOT FAIR THAT I HAVE

684
00:17:55,642 --> 00:17:57,244
TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING IN

AND GO TO FOOTBALL GAMES

SOMETHING HAS TO BE DECIDED

697
00:18:12,992 --> 00:18:15,962
UPON, BECAUSE THERE'S NO ONE

706
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:35,215

1303
00:33:47,659 --> 00:33:51,697
>> RIGHT.

1304
00:33:51,697 --> 00:33:52,531
>> I NEED NATHAN TO START

1305
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,866
DOING MORE, BUT I'M GETTING

1306
00:33:54,866 --> 00:33:56,368
NERVOUS HE'S NOT WILLING

1307
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,837
TO CHANGE.

1308
00:33:58,837 --> 00:33:59,838
>> YOU ACT LIKE I DON'T HELP.

1309
00:33:59,838 --> 00:34:01,006
>> SHH!

1310
00:34:01,006 --> 00:34:01,907
[whispering] QUIT YELLING.

1311
00:34:01,907 --> 00:34:02,574
>> SHUT UP.

1312
00:34:02,574 --> 00:34:03,242
>> QUIT YELLING.

1313
00:34:03,242 --> 00:34:03,909
IF YOU WAKE HER UP--

1314
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:05,544
>> YOU ACT LIKE I DON'T HELP.

1315
00:34:05,544 --> 00:34:07,213
>> YOU HELP, BUT YOU DO IT ONLY

1316
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:08,046
WHEN IT'S YOUR TURN.

1317
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,047
AFTER YOU FEED HER, IT'S LIKE,

1318
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:09,915
"I'M NOT DEALING WITH HER."

1319
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:11,016
>> NO, IT'S NOT.

1320
00:34:11,016 --> 00:34:12,684
I DO EVERYTHING AROUND HERE.

1321
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:14,019
EVERY TIME--LIKE, IF I--

1322
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:14,820
>> NO, YOU DON'T.

1323
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:15,654
>> YEAH, I DO.

1324
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:16,655
YOU ASK ME TO DO SOMETHING--

1325
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:17,489
>> YOU TAKE OUT TRASH.

1326
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:20,159
>> SHUT UP.

1327
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,026
>> YOU ACT LIKE IT'S SUCH

1328
00:34:21,026 --> 00:34:21,827
A HARD JOB.

1329
00:34:21,827 --> 00:34:22,494
LIKE, I WOULD RATHER

1330
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:23,562
TAKE OUT TRASH.

1331
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:25,731
>> ARE YOU STUPID?

1332
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:26,898
>> THE THING IS, MOST OF

1333
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,567
THE DAY, I TAKE CARE OF HER,

1334
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:30,068
AND JUST BECAUSE I ASK YOU TO

1335
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,570
GET ME ONE THING DOESN'T MEAN--

1336
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:32,571
>> I DO STUFF FOR YOU

1337
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:33,639
ALL DAY LONG.

1338
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:34,806
>> OKAY, BUT IT'S FOR AUBRI

1339
00:34:34,806 --> 00:34:35,474
MOST OF THE TIME.

1340
00:34:35,474 --> 00:34:36,475
>> IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING

1341
00:34:36,475 --> 00:34:37,509
WITH YOU.

1342
00:34:37,509 --> 00:34:39,178
>> BECAUSE YOU FRUSTRATE ME.

1343
00:34:39,178 --> 00:34:40,346
>> SEE, IT'S ME.

1344
00:34:40,346 --> 00:34:42,181
>> YOU FRUSTRATE ME.

1345
00:34:42,181 --> 00:34:43,515
>> YOU FRUSTRATE YOURSELF.

1346
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:44,516
>> NO, YOU FRUSTRATE ME.

1347
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:45,851
THIS RIGHT HERE IS

1348
00:34:45,851 --> 00:34:47,186
FRUSTRATING ME.

1349
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:48,019
I'M GOING TO BED.

1350
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:50,356
GIVE ME MY PILLOW.

1351
00:34:50,356 --> 00:34:51,523
thump!

1352
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:52,891
whap!

1353
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:55,161
>> GOD, YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

1354
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:06,638
>> MY MOM OVERHEARD OUR FIGHT

1355
00:35:06,638 --> 00:35:08,607
LAST NIGHT AND IS FINALLY

1356
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:09,441
FED UP.

1357
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:10,176
>> YOU KNOW, ALL TAYLOR

1358
00:35:10,176 --> 00:35:12,110
IS ASKING FOR IS HELP.

1359
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,445
YOU BITCH, YOU KNOW.

1360
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:15,314
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO YOUR SHARE.

1361
00:35:15,314 --> 00:35:16,648
>> WHO SAYS I DIDN'T?

1362
00:35:16,648 --> 00:35:17,649
I ALWAYS DO.

1363
00:35:17,649 --> 00:35:18,317
>> SHE DOES!

1364
00:35:18,317 --> 00:35:20,352
YOU'RE HERE, BUT YOU'RE NOT.

1365
00:35:20,352 --> 00:35:21,187
>> I DO HELP.

1366
00:35:21,187 --> 00:35:23,689
WE SHARE LIKE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO.

1367
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:24,523
>> BUT YOU COMPLAIN ABOUT IT.

1368
00:35:24,523 --> 00:35:25,424
I DON'T SIT THERE AND COMPLAIN

1369
00:35:25,424 --> 00:35:26,158
ABOUT IT AND WAKE YOU UP

1370
00:35:26,158 --> 00:35:26,958
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,

1371
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:27,659
"PUT A BIB ON HER!"

1372
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:28,660
I DON'T SIT THERE AND DO THAT.

1373
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,595
>> YOU GET UP.

1374
00:35:29,595 --> 00:35:30,262
YOU DO YOUR SHARE.

1375
00:35:30,262 --> 00:35:31,096
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO DO IT

1376
00:35:31,096 --> 00:35:32,431
BY YOURSELF.

1377
00:35:32,431 --> 00:35:33,599
SHE DOESN'T NEED TO PUT

1378
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,933
A BIB ON THE BABY.

1379
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:35,934
YOU DON'T NEED TO GO

1380
00:35:35,934 --> 00:35:37,269
TO THE BATHROOM RIGHT AWAY.

1381
00:35:37,269 --> 00:35:37,936
FEED THE BABY.

1382
00:35:37,936 --> 00:35:38,770
THEN DO WHAT YOU NEED--

1383
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:39,438
DO YOUR BUSINESS.

1384
00:35:39,438 --> 00:35:40,939
YOU DON'T NEED HER TO GET UP.

1385
00:35:40,939 --> 00:35:42,107
THAT'S WHY SHE ASKED YOU

1386
00:35:42,107 --> 00:35:43,275
TO HELP, SO THAT SHE CAN

1387
00:35:43,275 --> 00:35:46,278
STAY IN BED AND SLEEP.

1388
00:35:46,278 --> 00:35:47,779
THIS ISN'T EASY FOR ANYONE,

1389
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:48,714
NATHAN.

1390
00:35:48,714 --> 00:35:49,415
>> EVERY TIME WE TALK,

1391
00:35:49,415 --> 00:35:50,216
YOU SIT HERE AND YELL AT ME,

1392
00:35:50,216 --> 00:35:50,882
AND IT'S LIKE--

1393
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:51,550
>> NO.

1394
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,218
>> YES, YOU DO.

1395
00:35:52,218 --> 00:35:54,220
>> 'CAUSE SHE GETS ATTITUDES.

1396
00:35:54,220 --> 00:35:55,721
>> BECAUSE YOU'RE MEAN TO ME!

1397
00:35:55,721 --> 00:35:56,555
>> OKAY.

1398
00:35:56,555 --> 00:35:58,390
>> YOU ARE MEAN TO HER, NATHAN.

1399
00:35:58,390 --> 00:35:59,325
>> YOU SHOULD SEE HOW SHE TREATS

1400
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:00,492
ME WHEN YOU'RE NOT AROUND.

1401
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:01,760
>> BECAUSE YOU'RE MEAN TO ME.

1402
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:02,994
IF YOU WERE NICE, YOU WOULD GET

1403
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:03,995
THE SAME RESPECT BACK.

1404
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:04,996
WHY SHOULD I SIT HERE

1405
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:05,631
AND BE NICE TO YOU

1406
00:36:05,631 --> 00:36:06,432
WHEN YOU DON'T EVEN--

1407
00:36:06,432 --> 00:36:07,266
>> EVEN WHEN I DO TRY TO BE

1408
00:36:07,266 --> 00:36:08,434
NICE, YOU STILL GET ATTITUDE.

1409
00:36:08,434 --> 00:36:09,435
>> I CAN'T HAVE THIS.

1410
00:36:09,435 --> 00:36:11,437
I CANNOT LIVE LIKE THIS.

1411
00:36:11,437 --> 00:36:12,271
>> HE COMPLAINS ABOUT

1412
00:36:12,271 --> 00:36:13,639
EVERYTHING, THOUGH.

1413
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:14,640
IT'S NOT FAIR.

1414
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,007
>> THIS SITUATION IS

1415
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:19,010
OUT OF CONTROL, AND I WILL NOT

1416
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,579
HAVE IT, PERIOD.

1417
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:22,548
I'M NOT LIVING LIKE THIS.

1418
00:36:22,548 --> 00:36:24,015
YOU HAVE AN ATTITUDE PROBLEM.

1419
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,317
THIS WHOLE SITUATION

1420
00:36:25,317 --> 00:36:27,018
IS WHY I SAID THAT CHILD NEEDED

1421
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,720
TO BE PUT UP FOR ADOPTION.

1422
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,055
IT WASN'T 'CAUSE I DIDN'T LOVE

1423
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:31,223
HER, AND IT WASN'T BECAUSE

1424
00:36:31,223 --> 00:36:33,058
I DIDN'T LOVE YOU TWO.

1425
00:36:33,058 --> 00:36:34,226
IT'S THE FACT THAT KIDS

1426
00:36:34,226 --> 00:36:36,161
SHOULD NOT HAVE KIDS,

1427
00:36:36,161 --> 00:36:37,496
'CAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW

1428
00:36:37,496 --> 00:36:40,766
TO HANDLE SITUATIONS YET.

1429
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:02,220
>> EVEN THOUGH MY MOM HAS HAD

1430
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,755
ENOUGH OF NATHAN, I'M NOT READY

1431
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:05,757
TO GIVE UP ON HIM.

1432
00:37:05,757 --> 00:37:06,858
I WANT TO GIVE HIM ONE MORE

1433
00:37:06,858 --> 00:37:09,595
CHANCE TO DO THIS TOGETHER.

1434
00:37:09,595 --> 00:37:10,762
OKAY, WE'RE GONNA SIT HERE

1435
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:12,598
AND TALK, AND WE'RE NOT GONNA

1436
00:37:12,598 --> 00:37:13,599
CALL EACH OTHER NAMES.

1437
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:14,466
YOU'RE NOT GONNA YELL AT ME.

1438
00:37:14,466 --> 00:37:15,434
I'M NOT GONNA YELL AT YOU.

1439
00:37:15,434 --> 00:37:17,102
>> OKAY.

1440
00:37:17,102 --> 00:37:18,270
>> I'M UP 24-7 WITH THIS CHILD

1441
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:19,104
WHEN YOU ARE NOT HERE.

1442
00:37:19,104 --> 00:37:20,238
>> THAT DOESN'T MEAN NOTHING.

1443
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,139
>> SO I'M HOME ALONE WITH HER

1444
00:37:21,139 --> 00:37:21,907
ALL THE TIME.

1445
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:22,908
>> YOU ACT LIKE I'M NEVER THERE.

1446
00:37:22,908 --> 00:37:24,576
I'M THERE ALL THE TIME.

1447
00:37:24,576 --> 00:37:25,411
>> OKAY, BEING THERE

1448
00:37:25,411 --> 00:37:28,246
AND HELPING OUT ARE JUST

1449
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:29,080
TWO DIFFERENT THINGS.

1450
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:30,081
>> WHEN I'M THERE, I DO HELP,

1451
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,082
AND YOU ACT LIKE I DON'T.

1452
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:31,817
>> I HAVE TO FORCE YOU.

1453
00:37:31,817 --> 00:37:32,484
I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

1454
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:33,184
>> NO, YOU DON'T.

1455
00:37:33,184 --> 00:37:33,952
>> YOU SHOULD JUST BE ABLE

1456
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:34,520
TO DO IT.

1457
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,454
I'M THE ONE WHO GIVES HER BATHS.

1458
00:37:35,454 --> 00:37:36,288
I'M THE ONE WHO FEEDS HER.

1459
00:37:36,288 --> 00:37:38,424
BASICALLY WHAT I'M SAYING IS,

1460
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:39,758
YOU OWE IT TO HER TO BE

1461
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:40,592
A GOOD FATHER, AND YOU OWE IT

1462
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:42,761
TO ME TO BE A GOOD BOYFRIEND.

1463
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:43,762
AND YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE

1464
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:45,230
NOT TO HAVE A DAD; WE BOTH DO.

1465
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,898
BUT ALLS WE DO IS SIT HERE

1466
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:48,066
AND FIGHT, OR YOU'RE MAD AT ME,

1467
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:49,335
OR YOU WANT TO BE MEAN

1468
00:37:49,335 --> 00:37:50,068
AND HATEFUL TOWARDS ME.

1469
00:37:50,068 --> 00:37:50,836
>> WELL, EVERYBODY THINKS

1470
00:37:50,836 --> 00:37:52,571
IT'S ALWAYS ME.

1471
00:37:52,571 --> 00:37:53,405
IT'S ALWAYS THE GUY

1472
00:37:53,405 --> 00:37:56,241
IN TAYLOR AND DEBI'S WORLD.

1473
00:37:56,241 --> 00:37:57,242
>> OKAY, THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO

1474
00:37:57,242 --> 00:37:58,009
WITH MY MOM.

1475
00:37:58,009 --> 00:37:59,345
I TRY TO KEEP US TOGETHER.

1476
00:37:59,345 --> 00:38:01,680
YOU--WE STAY--I THINK THE ONLY

1477
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,015
REASON WE STAY TOGETHER IS

1478
00:38:04,015 --> 00:38:05,183
A LITTLE BIT OF LOVE

1479
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:06,352
AND BECAUSE OF HER.

1480
00:38:06,352 --> 00:38:08,887
>> IS THAT REALLY THE REASON?

1481
00:38:08,887 --> 00:38:09,788
>> I'M SURE IF WE DIDN'T

1482
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,056
HAVE A KID, WE WOULD STILL BE

1483
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:12,724
KIND OF HAPPY AND IN LA-LA LAND

1484
00:38:12,724 --> 00:38:16,728
AND TEENAGERS, BUT...

1485
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:18,063
>> YOU GUYS EXPECT ME NOT TO BE

1486
00:38:18,063 --> 00:38:19,230
STRESSED OUT, PUTTING ALL THIS

1487
00:38:19,230 --> 00:38:21,567
FRICKIN' STRUGGLE ON ME.

1488
00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:22,768
>> AND I'M NOT STRESSED?

1489
00:38:22,768 --> 00:38:23,769
>> WHAT ARE YOU STRESSED ABOUT?

1490
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:24,636
YOU AIN'T GOT TO GET A JOB.

1491
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:25,371
YOU AIN'T GOT TO GET

1492
00:38:25,371 --> 00:38:26,405
ALL THIS CRAP TO SUPPORT

1493
00:38:26,405 --> 00:38:28,073
AND ALL THAT.

1494
00:38:28,073 --> 00:38:30,576
WHAT ARE YOU STRESSED ABOUT?

1495
00:38:30,576 --> 00:38:34,145
>> US.

1496
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:35,146
US.

1497
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:36,147
IF SHE'S GONNA HAVE A FATHER,

1498
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:39,418
IF I'M GONNA HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

1499
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:44,423
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH NATHAN

1500
00:38:44,423 --> 00:38:47,426
IS HARDER NOW, 'CAUSE NOW WE'RE

1501
00:38:47,426 --> 00:38:49,795
KIND OF STUCK WITH EACH OTHER.

1502
00:38:49,795 --> 00:38:50,796
IT'S LIKE AN OLD MARRIED COUPLE

1503
00:38:50,796 --> 00:38:52,330
OR SOMETHING.

1504
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:54,099
IT SUCKS.

1505
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:54,933
GO WASH IT OFF.

1506
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:56,267
>> YOU WASH IT OFF.

1507
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:58,103
>> OH, MY GOD.

1508
00:38:58,103 --> 00:39:00,171
I BET IF WE DIDN'T HAVE AUBRI,

1509
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,339
OUR RELATIONSHIP MIGHT BE

1510
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,008
A LITTLE BIT BETTER

1511
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:04,576
AND NOT SO HARD,

1512
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:05,911
BECAUSE WE'RE BOTH MOODY.

1513
00:39:05,911 --> 00:39:06,812
WE'RE BOTH TIRED.

1514
00:39:06,812 --> 00:39:08,914
WE'RE JUST--WE JUST WANT

1515
00:39:08,914 --> 00:39:10,081
OUR TEEN YEARS BACK,

1516
00:39:10,081 --> 00:39:11,249
SO IT GETS--IT JUST PUTS

1517
00:39:11,249 --> 00:39:12,418
A STRAIN ON IT.

1518
00:39:12,418 --> 00:39:13,084
LEAVE IT.

1519
00:39:13,084 --> 00:39:14,420
OH, MY GOD, STOP.

1520
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,521
YOU'RE BEING ANNOYING.

1521
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:16,688
I DON'T WANT AUBRI GROWING UP

1522
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:18,023
WITHOUT A DAD, 'CAUSE ME AND HIM

1523
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:19,758
BOTH KNOW HOW IT FEELS.

1524
00:39:19,758 --> 00:39:20,659
THAT ONE LOOKS KIND OF GOOD,

1525
00:39:20,659 --> 00:39:21,493
ACTUALLY.

1526
00:39:21,493 --> 00:39:22,293
HERE, LET'S DO ONE MORE,

1527
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:23,194
JUST IN CASE.

1528
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:24,195
AND I DON'T WANT HER JUST

1529
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,765
TO HAVE THAT CONSTANT PAIN

1530
00:39:26,765 --> 00:39:28,867
THAT WE BOTH HAVE, AND IT'S JUST

1531
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:30,035
NOT FUN GROWING UP WITHOUT

1532
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:31,069
TWO PARENTS.

1533
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:32,070
>> THERE, YOU AIN'T KICKING

1534
00:39:32,070 --> 00:39:33,338
THEM OFF.

1535
00:39:33,338 --> 00:39:34,339
>> BUT IF HE DOESN'T TAKE

1536
00:39:34,339 --> 00:39:35,507
THE RIGHT STEPS TO BECOME

1537
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:37,509
A BETTER DAD, THEN HE CAN'T

1538
00:39:37,509 --> 00:39:39,678
BE AROUND AUBRI.

1539
00:39:39,678 --> 00:39:40,512
IT MAKES ME SAD THAT NATHAN

1540
00:39:40,512 --> 00:39:41,847
GETS TO GET UP AND GO TO SCHOOL

1541
00:39:41,847 --> 00:39:42,848
EVERY DAY, 'CAUSE EVERYBODY SAYS

1542
00:39:42,848 --> 00:39:44,349
HIGH SCHOOL IS THE BEST THING

1543
00:39:44,349 --> 00:39:45,517
EVER, BUT I'M MISSING OUT

1544
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:46,685
ON THAT EXPERIENCE,

1545
00:39:46,685 --> 00:39:48,887
AND I FEEL OLD.

1546
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:49,788
>> IT'S HARD TO TAKE CARE

1547
00:39:49,788 --> 00:39:51,790
OF A BABY AND BE A TEENAGER.

1548
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:52,891
>> IT'S HARD WHEN I KNOW

1549
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:54,392
MY FRIENDS ARE OUT HAVING FUN,

1550
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,393
AND I'M STUCK AT HOME

1551
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,895
WITH AUBRI.

1552
00:39:56,895 --> 00:39:58,363
BUT I DON'T EVER REGRET

1553
00:39:58,363 --> 00:39:59,531
HAVING AUBRI.

1554
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:00,866
I JUST REGRET HAVING HER SO

1555
00:40:00,866 --> 00:40:03,201
YOUNG AND NOT HAVING THE STUFF

1556
00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:04,536
I NEED TO TAKE CARE OF HER

1557
00:40:04,536 --> 00:40:06,705
AND JUST MISSING OUT ON

1558
00:40:06,705 --> 00:40:08,173
MY TEEN YEARS.

1559
00:40:08,173 --> 00:40:09,340
THAT'S THE BIGGEST PART,

1560
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,876
AND IT'S THE SADDEST PART.

1561
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:12,377
EW, IT'S UP HER BACK, NATHAN.

1562
00:40:12,377 --> 00:40:13,545
HOLD HER LEGS.

1563
00:40:13,545 --> 00:40:14,546
>> OH!

1564
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:15,246
>> OH, MY GOD.

1565
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,147
I THINK THERE'S GONNA BE MORE

1566
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:18,584
HARD TIMES BUT HOPEFULLY MORE

1567
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:20,351
GOOD TIMES THAN BAD.

1568
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:21,853
YOU JUST NEVER KNOW.

1569
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:23,421
IT'S LIFE, SO YOU JUST

1570
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,957
GOT TO DEAL WITH IT.

ANGRY?

1577
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:46,545
YOU'RE NOT TO SET FOOT

1578

IN MY [bleep] HOUSE!

YOU BITCH!

1580

smack!

1581

1582
00:40:50,582 --> 00:40:51,282
IF WE STAY OVER THERE.

1583

1584
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:53,118
MY [bleep] HOUSE!

1585
00:40:53,118 --> 00:40:54,586

>> GOOD JOB.

1589
00:40:56,788 --> 00:40:58,223
>> OH, I'LL GET HIM.

1590
00:40:58,223 --> 00:40:59,090
I DON'T KNOW WHY I EVEN ASK.

1591
00:40:59,090 --> 00:40:59,758
YOU DON'T HELP.

1592
00:40:59,758 --> 00:41:00,692
>> YOU'RE FREAKING UNGRATEFUL!

1593
00:41:00,692 --> 00:41:02,160
>> I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE.

1594
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,061
IT'S DONE.

1595
00:41:03,061 --> 00:41:03,929
>> WHEN DID WE BECOME SO BROKEN?

1596
00:41:03,929 --> 00:41:04,596
>> WHEN YOU STOPPED

1597
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:05,597
TAKING CARE OF AIDEN.

1598
00:41:05,597 --> 00:41:06,297
>> 'CAUSE OF THAT?

1599
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:07,198
>> YEAH.

1600
