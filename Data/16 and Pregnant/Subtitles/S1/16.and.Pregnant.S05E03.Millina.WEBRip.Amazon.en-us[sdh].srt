>> [giggles]

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:07,667
OKAY, I'M DONE.

3
00:00:07,667 --> 00:00:08,700
I'M DONE.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:09,667
I'M MILLINA.

5
00:00:09,667 --> 00:00:11,667
I'M 17, AND I LIVE IN HARRISON

6
00:00:11,667 --> 00:00:12,833
TOWNSHIP, MICHIGAN,

7
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:14,567
RIGHT OUTSIDE OF DETROIT.

8
00:00:14,567 --> 00:00:16,167
MY PARENTS ARE DIVORCED,

9
00:00:16,167 --> 00:00:17,467
AND I USED TO LIVE WITH MY MOM,

10
00:00:17,467 --> 00:00:18,733
BUT SHE STRUGGLES WITH DRUG

11
00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:19,800
ADDICTION, AND HAS BEEN IN

12
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,033
AND OUT OF JAIL FOR THE PAST

13
00:00:21,033 --> 00:00:22,933
FIVE YEARS.

14
00:00:22,933 --> 00:00:24,833
MY DAD CAN BE LOTS OF FUN.

15
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:25,633
>> "DAD, CHECK ME OUT.

16
00:00:25,633 --> 00:00:26,733
I'M JAMMIN'."

17
00:00:26,733 --> 00:00:27,533
>> [giggles]

18
00:00:27,533 --> 00:00:28,233
BUT HE'S PRETTY FLAKY

19
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:29,367
AND CAN'T REALLY AFFORD

20
00:00:29,367 --> 00:00:30,267
TO SUPPORT ME,

21
00:00:30,267 --> 00:00:31,633
SO NOW MY LITTLE BROTHER MOSES

22
00:00:31,633 --> 00:00:33,100
AND I LIVE WITH MY GRANDMA,

23
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,067
WHO TAKES REALLY GOOD CARE

24
00:00:34,067 --> 00:00:34,900
OF US.

25
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,800
>> WOW, LET'S CELEBRATE.

26
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,300
>> I'M NOT PICKING THOSE UP.

27
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:40,000
BUT HAVING A TROUBLED FAMILY

28
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,700
HASN'T BEEN EASY ON ME.

29
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,733
I WENT THROUGH A PRETTY

30
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:43,833
REBELLIOUS PHASE WHEN I DROPPED

31
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:44,867
OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL,

32
00:00:44,867 --> 00:00:46,000
AND STARTED SPENDING A LOT

33
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,167
OF TIME IN THE RAVE SCENE.

34
00:00:49,167 --> 00:00:49,933
AND THAT'S WHERE I MET

35
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:51,933
MY BOYFRIEND TREVOR.

36
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:56,600
>> STOP.

37
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,900
>> [giggling]

38
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:58,700
WE'RE SO ALIKE,

39
00:00:58,700 --> 00:00:59,767
IT'S ALMOST CREEPY.

40
00:00:59,767 --> 00:01:01,100
WHAT SHIRT ARE YOU WEARING?

41
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:02,400
>> SAME ONE AS YOU.

42
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,800
>> [laughing] THAT IS SO...

43
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,067
AND WE LOVE TO STAY OUT

44
00:01:05,067 --> 00:01:06,433
TILL THE SUN COMES UP.

45
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:07,500
BUT OUR ALL-NIGHTERS

46
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,067
ARE ABOUT TO GET MUCH LESS FUN,

47
00:01:09,067 --> 00:01:11,400
BECAUSE I'M PREGNANT.

48
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:21,833
I'M SEVEN MONTHS PREGNANT,

49
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:22,967
AND TREVOR AND I DECIDED

50
00:01:22,967 --> 00:01:24,567
TO NAME OUR SON KAYDEN.

51
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:25,667
MY MOM HAS BEEN IN JAIL

52
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:27,133
ON A DRUG POSSESSION CHARGE

53
00:01:27,133 --> 00:01:28,633
FOR MY WHOLE PREGNANCY.

54
00:01:28,633 --> 00:01:29,700
I'M HOPING THAT SHE GETS

55
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,233
RELEASED INTO A REHAB FACILITY

56
00:01:31,233 --> 00:01:32,633
IN TIME FOR MY DUE DATE.

57
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:34,167
BUT UNTIL THEN, ALL WE CAN DO

58
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:35,433
IS TALK ON THE PHONE.

59
00:01:35,433 --> 00:01:36,833
>> THIS CALL WILL BE RECORDED

60
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:38,133
AND SUBJECT TO MONITORING

61
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:39,233
AT ANY TIME.

62
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:41,067
YOU MAY BEGIN SPEAKING NOW.

63
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,067
>> HELLO?

64
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:45,500
I GOT THE 3-D ULTRASOUND

65
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,700
DONE.

66
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,667
>> DID YOU?

67
00:01:47,667 --> 00:01:49,067
>> I GOT THIS BEAR,

68
00:01:49,067 --> 00:01:50,200
AND YOU SQUEEZE IT,

69
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,633
AND IT HAS KAYDEN'S HEARTBEAT

70
00:01:51,633 --> 00:01:52,800
IN IT.

71
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,167
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?

72
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:55,133
>> YEAH.

73
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:55,967
>> AW.

74
00:01:55,967 --> 00:01:56,733
>> HEY, LISTEN.

75
00:01:56,733 --> 00:01:57,667
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'LL BE ABLE

76
00:01:57,667 --> 00:01:58,633
TO HEAR IT, THOUGH.

77
00:01:58,633 --> 00:02:00,600
[heartbeat whooshing]

78
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:03,367
>> [squeals]

79
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:06,633
I FEEL LIKE THE WORST MOM.

80
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:07,767
>> YOU'RE NOT, MAMA.

81
00:02:07,767 --> 00:02:09,467
I CAN'T SEND PICTURES ANYMORE,

82
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:10,167
CAN I?

83
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:10,967
>> NO.

84
00:02:10,967 --> 00:02:11,767
BECAUSE HER COURT DATE'S

85
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:12,900
THE 18TH.

86
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,467
>> NEXT TIME WE GO TO COURT,

87
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,067
THEY'RE HAVING THEIR ARGUMENT

88
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:18,200
AND THEY'RE HAVING THEIR

89
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,400
VERDICT.

90
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,867
>> I'M NOT GONNA BREAK.

91
00:02:20,867 --> 00:02:21,733
I'M GONNA LET IT MAKE ME

92
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:22,500
STRONGER.

93
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,933
I'M NOT THAT PERSON

94
00:02:23,933 --> 00:02:24,833
WHEN I'M NOT ADDICTED,

95
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,300
YOU KNOW, WHEN I'M CLEAN.

96
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,967
>> MOM, I DON'T LOOK DOWN ON

97
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:28,700
YOU.

98
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,600
I DON'T LOOK AT YOU DIFFERENTLY.

99
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,367
YOU ARE MY MOM.

100
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:31,700
I'M ALWAYS GONNA LOVE YOU.

101
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,700
YOU MESSED UP.

102
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:33,867
>> I'VE GOT ONE MINUTE.

103
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:35,467
WE GOT ONE MINUTE REMAINING.

104
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:37,167
HONEY, I'M SO SORRY.

105
00:02:37,167 --> 00:02:38,200
>> I'M SORRY, MAMA.

106
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,167
I LOVE YOU.

107
00:02:39,167 --> 00:02:40,067
>> [automated voice] GOOD-BYE.

108
00:02:40,067 --> 00:02:42,500
>> BYE.

109
00:02:49,367 --> 00:02:50,800
WITH EVERYTHING THAT'S GOING

110
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,867
ON WITH MY MOM,

111
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:52,900
WITH HER BEING IN JAIL

112
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,133
AND WITH HER HAVING

113
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:56,533
ALL OF HER COURT DATES

114
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:59,567
AND ME WANTING TO HAVE

115
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:01,667
MY MOM THERE,

116
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:03,067
IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME

117
00:03:03,067 --> 00:03:06,667
TO PUT MY 100% FOCUS

118
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:10,233
ON KAYDEN WHEN I'M DISTRACTED.

119
00:03:10,233 --> 00:03:12,433
>> I DON'T--I CAN'T BLAME YOU.

120
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:14,633
I MEAN, IT'S YOUR MOM.

121
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:16,067
BUT I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND,

122
00:03:16,067 --> 00:03:17,167
LIKE, THAT'S A GROWN WOMAN.

123
00:03:17,167 --> 00:03:18,333
SHE MAKES HER OWN DECISIONS.

124
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,967
SHE GETS HER OWN CONSEQUENCES.

125
00:03:20,967 --> 00:03:22,200
AND NOW THIS IS YOUR TIME

126
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,233
TO START YOUR OWN

127
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:26,633
DECISION-MAKING.

128
00:03:26,633 --> 00:03:27,433
>> RIGHT.

129
00:03:27,433 --> 00:03:28,567
WITH MY MOM, SHE'D GO

130
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:29,900
AND SHE'D PROMISE THINGS,

131
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,233
AND THEN SHE WOULDN'T DO IT.

132
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:33,767
AND YOU'VE PROVED TO ME

133
00:03:33,767 --> 00:03:35,700
THAT I CAN TRUST YOU.

134
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,200
BUT IT'S JUST THE FACT

135
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,700
THAT THERE'S STILL THAT LITTLE

136
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,667
TEENY, LIKE, DEVIL ON MY

137
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:41,967
SHOULDER GOING,

138
00:03:41,967 --> 00:03:42,933
"EVERY TIME YOU TRUST SOMEBODY,

139
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:43,733
THEY LET YOU DOWN."

140
00:03:43,733 --> 00:03:44,733
>> RIGHT.

141
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:45,633
>> WELL, I MEAN, LIKE, THE ONLY

142
00:03:45,633 --> 00:03:47,200
WAY WE CAN REALLY WORK ON IT

143
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,500
AND MOVE FORWARD IS IF

144
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,300
YOU LET THAT GO.

145
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,300
I'M NOT THOSE PEOPLE.

146
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,533
>> IT'S JUST THE FACT OF,

147
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:54,567
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO GO

148
00:03:54,567 --> 00:03:55,433
THROUGH THAT AGAIN.

149
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:56,600
SO I'M HOPING FOR THE BEST,

150
00:03:56,600 --> 00:03:58,100
BUT EXPECTING THE WORST.

151
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,133
>> RIGHT.

152
00:03:59,133 --> 00:04:01,400
IT'S GONNA BE ROUGH,

153
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,133
TO SAY THE LEAST.

154
00:04:04,133 --> 00:04:05,867
WE GOT TO KEEP STRONG,

155
00:04:05,867 --> 00:04:08,700
KEEP DOING HARDER

156
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,067
AND WE GOT TO KEEP GOING FURTHER

157
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:11,700
WITH EVERYTHING WE CAN DO

158
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,800
PRODUCTIVELY TOWARDS

159
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,267
KAYDEN'S FUTURE.

160
00:04:22,133 --> 00:04:23,300
>> WHAT'S A BRISKET?

161
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,400
IS IT LIKE A BISCUIT

162
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,100
WITH A "R"?

163
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,067
>> NO, IT'S LIKE--

164
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:26,867
IT'S KIND OF, LIKE, SHREDDED

165
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:27,967
AND IT'S GOT BARBECUE SAUCE

166
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:28,800
IN IT.

167
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,633
>> OKAY.

168
00:04:29,633 --> 00:04:30,433
I GOT ALL EXCITED.

169
00:04:30,433 --> 00:04:31,300
I SEEN BARBECUE SAUCE

170
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,900
AND WAS LIKE, "AH."

171
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,333
>> YOU AND YOUR WEIRD PREGNANCY

172
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,233
FOOD CRAVINGS.

173
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:37,167
>> [chuckles]

174
00:04:37,167 --> 00:04:38,067
>> WHAT WERE YOU THINKING

175
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:38,800
WHEN YOU FOUND OUT

176
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,733
THAT YOU WERE PREGNANT?

177
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:43,300
>> UM, I WAS REALLY WORRIED.

178
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,133
I DIDN'T REALLY KNOW

179
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:46,633
WHAT TO THINK.

180
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:49,500
JUST KIND OF LOOKING BACK NOW,

181
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,333
I THINK OF ALL THE THINGS

182
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:53,100
I COULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY.

183
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,633
AND BEFORE THEN, I WAS TOTALLY

184
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:55,567
AGAINST GETTING ON BIRTH

185
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:56,467
CONTROL TOO.

186
00:04:56,467 --> 00:04:57,667
BECAUSE I KNEW A LOT OF PEOPLE

187
00:04:57,667 --> 00:04:58,667
THAT HAD A LOT OF DIFFERENT

188
00:04:58,667 --> 00:05:00,333
ISSUES WHEN THEY STARTED

189
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:01,900
THAT THEY DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE.

190
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:02,733
AND I WAS LIKE,

191
00:05:02,733 --> 00:05:03,633
IT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN TO ME.

192
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:04,267
WELL, GUESS WHAT?

193
00:05:04,267 --> 00:05:05,067
IT DID.

194
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:05,767
>> WELL, ARE YOU GONNA DO

195
00:05:05,767 --> 00:05:06,600
SOME RESEARCH ON SOME BIRTH

196
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,067
CONTROL FOR AFTER KAYDEN'S MORE?

197
00:05:08,067 --> 00:05:08,967
>> YEAH.

198
00:05:08,967 --> 00:05:10,667
AND I DON'T WANT ANOTHER

199
00:05:10,667 --> 00:05:11,400
"UH-OH."

200
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,267
[laughs]

201
00:05:12,267 --> 00:05:13,533
>> ONCE KAYDEN'S BORN,

202
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:16,467
AND YOU'VE HAD A FEW MONTHS

203
00:05:16,467 --> 00:05:17,833
TO RECUPERATE,

204
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,333
ARE YOU GONNA WANT TO GO BACK

205
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,200
OUT AND PARTY LIKE THAT AGAIN?

206
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,333
>> I MEAN, SOMETIMES I DO

207
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,167
MISS IT.

208
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:24,467
BUT I DON'T WANT TO GET INVOLVED

209
00:05:24,467 --> 00:05:25,600
WITH THE DRUGS, AND I DON'T

210
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,300
WANT TO GET INVOLVED

211
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,067
WITH THE DRINKING,

212
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:28,733
BECAUSE I DON'T EVER WANT

213
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:30,400
KAYDEN TO HAVE TO DEAL WITH

214
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,067
WHAT ME AND MO DEALT WITH.

215
00:05:32,067 --> 00:05:33,600
MY MOM GOT US TAKEN AWAY

216
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,100
FROM HER.

217
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,067
SO I DON'T EVER WANT HIM

218
00:05:37,067 --> 00:05:38,267
TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT.

219
00:05:38,267 --> 00:05:38,967
>> YEAH.

220
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:40,733
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK ABOUT

221
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:42,400
EVERY LITTLE THING THAT COULD

222
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,733
GET HIM TAKEN AWAY FROM ME.

223
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:44,800
I OVERTHINK IT.

224
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:45,700
LIKE, I'M LIKE, WELL, WHAT IF

225
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,467
SOMEBODY RANDOMLY CALLED

226
00:05:46,467 --> 00:05:47,267
PROTECTIVE SERVICES

227
00:05:47,267 --> 00:05:49,500
'CAUSE THEY GET MAD AT ME--

228
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:51,200
>> WELL, THAT'S COMPLETELY

229
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,333
NORMAL.

230
00:05:52,333 --> 00:05:53,400
IT'S COMPLETELY NORMAL.

231
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,367
SO DON'T FEEL BAD ABOUT

232
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:55,900
OVERTHINKING THINGS.

233
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,933
YOU JUST WANT TO DO BETTER

234
00:05:56,933 --> 00:05:59,800
THAN YOUR MOM DID.

235
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,867
>> THINGS WITH TREVOR ARE GOOD,

236
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:06,567
BUT I HAVE A HARD TIME

237
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:07,833
WITH HIS MOM, TINA,

238
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:09,067
BECAUSE SHE'S REALLY EMOTIONALLY

239
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:10,467
UNSTABLE, AND SHE HAS

240
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:11,967
A HEALTH CONDITION THAT CAUSES

241
00:06:11,967 --> 00:06:12,833
SEIZURES.

242
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,500
SHE'S ALSO REALLY JUDGMENTAL

243
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,933
OF MY MOM'S SITUATION.

244
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:17,433
BUT I TRY NOT TO SAY ANYTHING,

245
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:18,700
BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO TREVOR

246
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,900
THAT WE GET ALONG.

247
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:21,433
SO THIS IS, LIKE, A 3-D

248
00:06:21,433 --> 00:06:22,367
ULTRASOUND.

249
00:06:22,367 --> 00:06:23,267
>> YEAH.

250
00:06:23,267 --> 00:06:24,467
>> WHERE'S HIS HEAD?

251
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,633
>> THIS IS HIS HEAD RIGHT HERE.

252
00:06:25,633 --> 00:06:27,067
>> IS THAT--WHERE'S HIS PENIS?

253
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:28,100
>> IT'S NOT ON THERE.

254
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:28,833
>> THIS IS JUST HIS HEAD.

255
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:29,733
>> YEAH, THIS IS JUST HIS HEAD.

256
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:30,600
>> DO YOU THINK YOU'RE READY

257
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,667
FOR A BABY, YOU GUYS?

258
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:34,367
AS A COUPLE, YOU NEED TO DECIDE

259
00:06:34,367 --> 00:06:35,433
WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

260
00:06:35,433 --> 00:06:36,567
TO PLAN THIS BABY.

261
00:06:36,567 --> 00:06:37,433
>> RIGHT.

262
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:38,433
WELL, I THINK, LIKE, WHEN THE

263
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:40,667
BABY FIRST COMES,

264
00:06:40,667 --> 00:06:43,100
WE'RE GONNA KIND OF BALANCE

265
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,400
HIM BETWEEN BOTH--

266
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,367
WE'RE GONNA COME OVER HERE,

267
00:06:45,367 --> 00:06:46,500
WE'RE GONNA GO TO MY HOUSE.

268
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:48,333
AND THEN, I MEAN, EVENTUALLY,

269
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:49,467
I MEAN, WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT

270
00:06:49,467 --> 00:06:50,300
GETTING OUR OWN PLACE.

271
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,400
IT'S NOT A ANYTIME SOON THING,

272
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,100
BUT IT'S--

273
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,167
>> ONE DAY.

274
00:06:54,167 --> 00:06:54,900
FUTURE GOALS.

275
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:55,867
>> RIGHT.

276
00:06:55,867 --> 00:06:56,933
>> IT'S A LOT OF WORK

277
00:06:56,933 --> 00:06:58,133
TO RAISE A BABY.

278
00:06:58,133 --> 00:06:58,900
I KNOW.

279
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,667
I RAISED TWO BABIES BY MYSELF.

280
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:01,367
>> RIGHT.

281
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:02,133
AND I'M REALLY GRATEFUL

282
00:07:02,133 --> 00:07:04,100
THAT I'M NOT IN THIS BY MYSELF,

283
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,567
THAT I DO HAVE TREVOR

284
00:07:05,567 --> 00:07:06,800
TO HELP ME AND--

285
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,900
>> I TOLD YOU THAT I WOULD BE

286
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,867
HERE TO TAKE CARE OF THIS BABY.

287
00:07:09,867 --> 00:07:11,100
YOUR MOM WASN'T ANY HELP.

288
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,400
THAT'S WHY SHE'S NOT HERE,

289
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:13,567
OKAY?

290
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,133
BUT I'M HERE FOR YOU.

291
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:17,067
AND I'LL CONSUME MY MYSELF

292
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:18,300
HELPING YOU.

293
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,067
>> THANK YOU--

294
00:07:19,067 --> 00:07:20,067
>> AND I WILL ENJOY EVERY MINUTE

295
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:21,067
OF IT.

296
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:22,067
>> BUT WHEN YOU'RE HAVING

297
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,133
A SEIZURE, YOUR HANDS GO NUMB

298
00:07:23,133 --> 00:07:24,100
AND EVERYTHING.

299
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,267
DOES THAT EVERY CONCERN YOU

300
00:07:25,267 --> 00:07:26,433
WITH, LIKE, HOLDING THE BABY

301
00:07:26,433 --> 00:07:27,467
OR ANYTHING, THAT--

302
00:07:27,467 --> 00:07:29,067
ARE YOU EVER WORRIED ABOUT THAT?

303
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:29,833
>> NO.

304
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:30,833
>> NO?

305
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:31,833
>> IF I'M NOT OKAY,

306
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,433
I WOULD SAY I WASN'T OKAY,

307
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:34,867
AND I WOULD CALL SOMEONE

308
00:07:34,867 --> 00:07:35,800
TO HELP ME.

309
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,900
IT'S HARD HAVING A BABY.

310
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,133
AND YOU THINK YOU'RE NOT GONNA

311
00:07:39,133 --> 00:07:40,400
BE GLAD I'M THERE.

312
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,133
>> WELL, I'M--

313
00:07:41,133 --> 00:07:41,967
>> NOT SAYING WE DON'T WANT

314
00:07:41,967 --> 00:07:42,700
YOU THERE.

315
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,533
>> WE AREN'T SAYING THAT WE

316
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:44,267
DON'T WANT YOU THERE.

317
00:07:44,267 --> 00:07:45,067
WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT--

318
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:45,933
>> YOU'RE GONNA BE A HUGE PART

319
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:46,600
OF KAYDEN'S LIFE.

320
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,733
YOU'RE HIS GRANDMA.

321
00:07:59,367 --> 00:08:00,700
>> I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT

322
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,900
TINA WANTING TO TAKE CARE

323
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,233
OF KAYDEN.

324
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,500
BUT MY MOM ISN'T HERE TO HELP

325
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:05,667
OUT, AND I KNOW NAN DOESN'T

326
00:08:05,667 --> 00:08:07,700
WANT ANYMORE RESPONSIBILITIES.

327
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,767
CURRENTLY, THIS IS THE ONLY

328
00:08:08,767 --> 00:08:11,967
HOUSE THAT'S ACTUALLY STABLE.

329
00:08:11,967 --> 00:08:13,233
BUT I KNOW THAT YOU'RE--

330
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:14,267
HE'S GONNA BE CRYING,

331
00:08:14,267 --> 00:08:15,100
AND YOU'RE GONNA WANT THAT--

332
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:15,867
>> YEAH, I'M GONNA SAY,

333
00:08:15,867 --> 00:08:16,900
"MILLINA, YOU BETTER GET UP

334
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,733
AND DO SOMETHING WITH THIS

335
00:08:17,733 --> 00:08:18,433
CHILD."

336
00:08:18,433 --> 00:08:19,133
>> RIGHT.

337
00:08:19,133 --> 00:08:19,933
>> I DON'T WANT TO RAISE

338
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:20,600
YOUR CHILD.

339
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:22,167
I THINK IT'S A DAY-BY-DAY.

340
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:23,233
I'LL NEVER SAY,

341
00:08:23,233 --> 00:08:24,333
"WELL, YOU'VE GOT TO GO

342
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,067
AND YOU'VE GOT TO GO TO TAKE

343
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:27,267
THE BABY TO TINA'S

344
00:08:27,267 --> 00:08:28,600
OR HAVE TREVOR TAKE THE BABY."

345
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,533
I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT TO YOU.

346
00:08:30,533 --> 00:08:32,767
>> WITH TINA'S PHYSICAL

347
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,067
AND MENTAL ISSUES,

348
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:35,333
I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE

349
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,433
LEAVING HER WITH THE BABY

350
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,600
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, WE'VE WATCHED

351
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,067
HER DROP THINGS,

352
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:40,933
WE'VE WATCHED HER FALL, WE'VE--

353
00:08:40,933 --> 00:08:41,933
WHAT HAPPENS IF SHE GOES

354
00:08:41,933 --> 00:08:43,367
AND SHE FALLS WITH THE BABY?

355
00:08:43,367 --> 00:08:44,733
ANOTHER THING IS, TINA GOES

356
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,833
AND SHE'S LIKE, "OH," YOU KNOW,

357
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,500
SITTING THERE TALKING BADLY

358
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,900
ABOUT MY MOM.

359
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,867
>> DON'T DO ANYTHING YOU DON'T

360
00:08:50,867 --> 00:08:51,733
FEEL COMFORTABLE.

361
00:08:51,733 --> 00:08:52,867
YOU STILL HAVE THE RIGHT

362
00:08:52,867 --> 00:08:53,967
TO SAY NO.

363
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:55,800
ASIDE FROM HER PHYSICAL

364
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,500
IS HER BEING IRRATIONAL

365
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,400
AND THREATENING AT TIMES.

366
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,500
THIS IS WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT

367
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,867
BEFORE YOU HAVE A CHILD.

368
00:09:11,967 --> 00:09:13,200
>> I KNOW THAT STAYING WITH NAN

369
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,967
FULL-TIME IS MY BEST OPTION,

370
00:09:14,967 --> 00:09:16,100
BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

371
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,067
TREVOR AND I ARE ON

372
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:18,167
THE SAME PAGE.

373
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:19,767
SO WHAT ARE THINKING

374
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:22,900
IN TERMS OF BABY-RELATED--

375
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,133
LIKE, ARE YOU SCARED?

376
00:09:24,133 --> 00:09:25,533
WHAT'S...

377
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:26,933
>> I MEAN, I'M REALLY NERVOUS

378
00:09:26,933 --> 00:09:28,200
ABOUT HIM, BUT I'M REALLY

379
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,733
EXCITED TO MEET HIM.

380
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:31,633
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO,

381
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:32,467
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE'LL FIGURE

382
00:09:32,467 --> 00:09:33,367
THAT OUT.

383
00:09:33,367 --> 00:09:34,233
>> I'M JUST FREAKING OUT

384
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:34,967
RIGHT NOW.

385
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:36,633
LIKE, BEFORE WE'RE LIKE,

386
00:09:36,633 --> 00:09:37,400
OKAY, WELL, WE HAVE THIS

387
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,067
AMOUNT OF TIME,

388
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:38,933
WE HAVE THIS AMOUNT OF TIME.

389
00:09:38,933 --> 00:09:39,800
WE'RE PRETTY MUCH OUT OF TIME

390
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,500
NOW.

391
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,567
AND IT'S JUST, LIKE, THE FACT

392
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:42,700
OF, WE DON'T REALLY HAVE

393
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,800
A GAME PLAN.

394
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,067
LIKE, WE HAVE AN IDEA OF WHAT

395
00:09:45,067 --> 00:09:45,800
WE'RE GONNA DO,

396
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,367
BUT WE REALLY DON'T HAVE THE,

397
00:09:48,367 --> 00:09:49,333
"OKAY, THIS IS WHAT'S GONNA

398
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:50,067
HAPPEN."

399
00:09:50,067 --> 00:09:51,600
>> I MEAN, LIKE, I HAVE,

400
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,533
LIKE, SOME OF THE PREPARATIONS

401
00:09:54,533 --> 00:09:55,633
FOR, LIKE, THE DAY OF

402
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:57,333
AND, LIKE, YOU KNOW, A PLAN,

403
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,100
BUT IT'S MORE AFTER THAT

404
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,000
WHICH I NEED TO REALLY

405
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,200
FIGURE OUT.

406
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,300
>> I FEEL LIKE MY HOUSE

407
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:05,967
WOULD BE A BETTER ENVIRON--

408
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:07,833
OR A BETTER PLACE FOR HIM

409
00:10:07,833 --> 00:10:09,433
BECAUSE THERE'S MORE SPACE.

410
00:10:09,433 --> 00:10:10,400
>> YEAH.

411
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:12,167
I MEAN, IT'S GONNA BE TOUGH.

412
00:10:12,167 --> 00:10:13,600
BUT, I MEAN, I WOULD COME STAY

413
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,667
OVER SO THAT, LIKE, YOU COULD

414
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:15,467
SLEEP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

415
00:10:15,467 --> 00:10:16,200
NIGHT.

416
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,033
AND I'M SURE YOU'LL BE

417
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:17,800
EXHAUSTED.

418
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:18,733
AND I'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE CARE

419
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:20,600
OF HIM AND CHANGE HIS DIAPER

420
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,633
AND ALL THAT.

421
00:10:21,633 --> 00:10:22,733
>> YOU DON'T SOUND TOO THRILLED

422
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:23,867
ABOUT THAT.

423
00:10:23,867 --> 00:10:25,067
>> I THINK HE'D BE BETTER OFF

424
00:10:25,067 --> 00:10:26,000
AT MY HOUSE.

425
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,467
BUT THAT'S MORE FOR SELFISH

426
00:10:27,467 --> 00:10:30,067
REASONS.

427
00:10:36,733 --> 00:10:38,733
[doorbell rings]

428
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,000
>> HI, HALEY.

429
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:42,700
HOW YOU DOING, HONEY?

430
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,500
>> HEY, NAN, HOW ARE YOU?

431
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,233
>> GOOD.

432
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:45,133
MILLINA'S IN HER ROOM.

433
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:46,367
>> ALL RIGHT.

434
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:47,667
MILLINA.

435
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:50,333
>> OH, HEY.

436
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,000
HOW ARE YOU?

437
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,233
>> I'M DOING GOOD.

438
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:53,800
WORKED ALL DAY.

439
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,900
TOUCH MY BABY.

440
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,267
WHAT'S GOING ON?

441
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:58,167
>> MY MOM HAS A COURT DATE

442
00:10:58,167 --> 00:11:01,100
TOMORROW AT 8:15 IN THE MORNING.

443
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,067
>> ARE YOU GOING

444
00:11:02,067 --> 00:11:02,967
TO THE COURT DATE?

445
00:11:02,967 --> 00:11:04,667
>> I'M PLANNING ON GOING.

446
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:06,667
THE ATTORNEY REALLY BELIEVES

447
00:11:06,667 --> 00:11:07,567
THAT SHE CAN GET A WHOLE CASE

448
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:08,533
THROWN OUT.

449
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:10,800
AND IF SHE CAN LEAVE ON THAT,

450
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,800
HE'S GONNA SAY, "OKAY,

451
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,800
WE'RE GONNA RELEASE YOU,

452
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,233
AND YOU NEED TO BE INTO

453
00:11:14,233 --> 00:11:16,733
A PROGRAM IN X AMOUNT OF TIME."

454
00:11:16,733 --> 00:11:17,467
>> IF THAT HAPPENS,

455
00:11:17,467 --> 00:11:18,233
AT LEAST SHE'LL BE HERE

456
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:19,367
FOR KAYDEN.

457
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:20,067
>> IF SHE DOES GOOD,

458
00:11:20,067 --> 00:11:20,900
SHE'LL BE ABLE TO COME HOME

459
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,567
ON WEEKENDS.

460
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:23,100
I THINK THIS LAST TIME

461
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,300
THAT SHE RELAPSED

462
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,333
REALLY HAD A BIG EFFECT

463
00:11:25,333 --> 00:11:26,800
ON HER, BECAUSE SHE FELL INTO--

464
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,067
SHE FELL DOWN A RABBIT HOLE

465
00:11:28,067 --> 00:11:28,967
SO QUICK.

466
00:11:28,967 --> 00:11:30,733
YOU KNOW, SHE GOT INVOLVED

467
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:31,967
WITH IT, AND JUST, HER PROBLEM

468
00:11:31,967 --> 00:11:34,067
GOT SO BAD SO FAST.

469
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:36,833
LIKE, THIS WAS, LIKE--

470
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,667
I THINK THIS WAS LAST YEAR.

471
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:40,433
LIKE, LOOK AT HER FACE.

472
00:11:40,433 --> 00:11:42,367
SHE JUST LOOKS SO HAPPY.

473
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:43,233
AND THEN IT'S HARD TO WATCH

474
00:11:43,233 --> 00:11:44,733
HER GO FROM THAT, AND SEE HOW

475
00:11:44,733 --> 00:11:48,067
SHE WAS, TO THIS.

476
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:49,733
>> YEAH.

477
00:11:49,733 --> 00:11:51,600
>> IT'S REALLY HARD TO LOOK AT.

478
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,767
LIKE, I MEAN,

479
00:11:53,767 --> 00:11:54,867
I'VE DEALT WITH IT FOR A WHILE

480
00:11:54,867 --> 00:11:55,933
TO JUST FAKE A SMILE

481
00:11:55,933 --> 00:11:57,800
AND TELL EVERYBODY I'M OKAY,

482
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,400
BUT IT'S GETTING HARDER.

483
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,567
>> YOU KNOW, YOUR MOM,

484
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:03,600
NO MATTER WHAT, IS YOUR MOM,

485
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,167
AND SHE'S THE BEAUTIFUL PERSON

486
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:06,100
THAT YOU SEE IN THE FIRST

487
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,067
PICTURE.

488
00:12:07,067 --> 00:12:08,567
AND SHE'S MADE MISTAKES.

489
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:10,900
AND SOMETIMES SHE'S GONNA SEEM

490
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,833
UGLY AND BEATEN DOWN,

491
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:13,633
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN

492
00:12:13,633 --> 00:12:15,867
SHE DOESN'T LOVE YOU.

493
00:12:15,867 --> 00:12:17,900
>> IT JUST--I--

494
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,767
IT KIND OF--IT HURTS REALLY BAD.

495
00:12:19,767 --> 00:12:20,833
>> YEAH, MOMS AREN'T REALLY

496
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,767
REPLACEABLE.

497
00:12:22,767 --> 00:12:23,900
> I'M REALLY SCARED ABOUT

498
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,900
THE WHOLE SITUATION.

499
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:26,833
I JUST DON'T REALLY KNOW

500
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,900
HOW TO HANDLE IT.

501
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,667
NAN AND TREVOR BOTH HAVE WORK

502
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:35,267
TODAY, SO I'M GOING TO MY MOM'S

503
00:12:35,267 --> 00:12:36,533
COURT DATE BY MYSELF,

504
00:12:36,533 --> 00:12:39,067
AND I'M SUPER NERVOUS.

505
00:13:10,767 --> 00:13:11,433
>> THANK YOU.

506
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:13,733
>> THANK YOU.

507
00:13:15,633 --> 00:13:16,500
>> YES.

508
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,200
>> HE'S GONNA ARGUE

509
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,467
THE MOTION?

510
00:13:18,467 --> 00:13:21,233
>> HAVE HER SHOW UP AT 9:30.

511
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,500
>> IT REALLY SUCKS THAT MY MOM'S

512
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,800
GONNA BE IN JAIL WHEN THE BABY

513
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,067
COMES.

514
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:41,133
TREVOR'S BEEN BUSY AT HIS

515
00:13:41,133 --> 00:13:42,733
FAST FOOD JOB, AND I'M TRYING

516
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:44,167
TO SPEND MORE TIME WITH MY DAD.

517
00:13:44,167 --> 00:13:45,800
I HOPE THAT I CAN RAISE A BABY

518
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:46,900
BETTER THAN I CAN THROW

519
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:48,067
A FRISBEE.

520
00:13:48,067 --> 00:13:50,167
I FEEL LIKE...

521
00:13:50,167 --> 00:13:51,400
AFTER MOM GOES THROUGH THIS

522
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,067
YEAR-LONG PROGRAM,

523
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:54,933
I MEAN, I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE

524
00:13:54,933 --> 00:13:57,067
WITH HER BEING AROUND THE BABY,

525
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:57,900
ALONE WITH THE BABY,

526
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:59,667
UNTIL SHE PROVES TO ME

527
00:13:59,667 --> 00:14:01,600
THAT SHE'S OKAY.

528
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,967
WHAT TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP

529
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:03,667
DO YOU WANT TO HAVE

530
00:14:03,667 --> 00:14:04,633
WITH THE BABY?

531
00:14:04,633 --> 00:14:05,533
>> I KNOW I'VE HAD PROBLEMS

532
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:07,400
IN THE PAST WITH SEVERAL

533
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:10,733
THINGS--DRUGS, ALCOHOL.

534
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:12,400
YOU KNOW, SCREAMING,

535
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,633
YELLING.

536
00:14:13,633 --> 00:14:15,067
ABUSE.

537
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:16,500
AND, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT LIKE

538
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,300
THAT ANYMORE.

539
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,067
LUCKILY, I WENT TO THERAPY

540
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,567
AND IT WORKED.

541
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:22,167
I THINK THAT YOU AND TREVOR

542
00:14:22,167 --> 00:14:24,333
WILL BE ALL RIGHT IF YOU STAY

543
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,500
AWAY FROM ALL US GROWN-UPS.

544
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,533
AND I DON'T SO MUCH MEAN ME.

545
00:14:29,533 --> 00:14:31,400
I MEAN THE LADIES.

546
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,367
>> WITH TREVOR'S MOM,

547
00:14:32,367 --> 00:14:33,600
I'M WORRIED, LIKE--

548
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,700
SHE GOES AND SHE HAS STROKES,

549
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,167
AND WE WATCH HER DROP THINGS

550
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:37,933
REPEATEDLY.

551
00:14:37,933 --> 00:14:38,800
>> LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,

552
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,367
I KNEW THAT TREVOR'S MA

553
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:41,767
WAS BAD NEWS WITHIN

554
00:14:41,767 --> 00:14:43,200
THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES.

555
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,400
>> I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE

556
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:46,167
SAYING, "HERE'S MY KID.

557
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:47,200
YOU CAN BE ALONE WITH HIM,

558
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:47,900
WATCH HIM."

559
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,800
>> RIGHT.

560
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,900
WHY TAKE A CHANCE?

561
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:51,800
>> LIKE, I WANT THE BABY

562
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,400
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

563
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:57,067
A MORE STABLE LIFE THAN I DID.

564
00:14:57,067 --> 00:15:00,167
>> YEAH.

565
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,867
>> OH?

566
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:09,900
WHEN?

567
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,667
>> WHAT'D SHE SAY?

568
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,900
>> SO WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?

569
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,933
>> SO SHE'S MOVING IN

570
00:15:37,933 --> 00:15:40,500
WITH THESE PEOPLE WHO ARE

571
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,300
OPENING UP THEIR BASEMENT

572
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,667
TO OUR FAMILY.

573
00:15:44,667 --> 00:15:45,600
BUT, YEAH, I GUESS SHE

574
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:47,333
WANTS TO INCLUDE YOU IN ON IT.

575
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,300
>> OKAY.

576
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,733
SHE WANTS TO MOVE

577
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:52,400
YOU, HER, ME, AND KAYDEN

578
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,300
TO THIS LADY'S HOUSE?

579
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,333
>> IT'S THREE TIMES THE SIZE

580
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,367
OF OUR HOUSE.

581
00:15:56,367 --> 00:15:57,167
>> DO YOU WANT MY HONEST

582
00:15:57,167 --> 00:15:57,967
THOUGHT PROCESS,

583
00:15:57,967 --> 00:15:58,867
OR DO YOU WANT ME TO SUGARCOAT

584
00:15:58,867 --> 00:15:59,633
IT?

585
00:15:59,633 --> 00:16:01,167
>> I'LL TAKE THE HONESTY.

586
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:02,533
>> LIKE, I'D BE FINE WITH COMING

587
00:16:02,533 --> 00:16:05,700
OVER AND STAYING THE NIGHT,

588
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:09,067
YOU KNOW, BUT MOVING IN?

589
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:10,333
DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THAT

590
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:10,967
AT ALL.

591
00:16:10,967 --> 00:16:11,767
>> RIGHT.

592
00:16:11,767 --> 00:16:13,467
>> I'M, LIKE, 100% SICK

593
00:16:13,467 --> 00:16:15,433
OF JUST BITING MY TONGUE,

594
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,067
AND I DON'T APPRECIATE IT

595
00:16:17,067 --> 00:16:19,433
WHEN SHE'S SITTING THERE

596
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:22,667
BADMOUTHING MY MOM.

597
00:16:22,667 --> 00:16:23,833
>> I WANT YOU TO BE THERE

598
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:25,067
BECAUSE I LIKE BEING CLOSE

599
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:25,967
TO YOU, I LIKE BEING ABLE

600
00:16:25,967 --> 00:16:27,067
TO COME HOME FROM WORK

601
00:16:27,067 --> 00:16:28,567
AND SPEND TIME WITH YOU.

602
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:30,133
I THINK, YOU KNOW, WHAT WOULD

603
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:31,933
PROBABLY BE, LIKE, NOT THE BEST

604
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:34,867
IDEA, BUT FIRST STEP, I GUESS,

605
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:36,167
IF YOU WOULD LIKE,

606
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:37,833
YOU COULD COME OVER TOMORROW,

607
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:38,733
AND MAYBE YOU GUYS COULD

608
00:16:38,733 --> 00:16:39,667
SIT DOWN.

609
00:16:39,667 --> 00:16:42,067
AND I GUESS YOU COULD TRY TO

610
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:43,933
TALK TO HER, BECAUSE IT'S NOT

611
00:16:43,933 --> 00:16:46,833
GONNA GO AWAY.

612
00:16:46,833 --> 00:16:47,567
>> FINE.

613
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:48,500
I'LL COME OVER AND I'LL TALK

614
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:50,600
TO HER.

615
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:51,700
>> YEAH, THAT'S ALL I WANT.

616
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:52,833
I JUST WANT YOU TO TALK TO HER.

617
00:16:52,833 --> 00:16:53,700
IF IT DOESN'T WORK OUT,

618
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,367
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

619
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:05,367
>> WE'RE MOVING.

620
00:17:05,367 --> 00:17:06,300
>> I HEARD.

621
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,500
WHY DID YOU DECIDE

622
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,800
THAT YOU GUYS ARE MOVING?

623
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,567
>> WELL, UM...

624
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:15,067
>> RIGHT.

625
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,900
>> BUT ONE OF MY BEST FRIENDS,

626
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:19,500
SHE'S GOT A 2,000-SQUARE-FOOT

627
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,067
BASEMENT SHE HAS REMODELED

628
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:22,067
FOR US.

629
00:17:22,067 --> 00:17:23,267
>> THAT'S COOL.

630
00:17:23,267 --> 00:17:25,333
>> AND YOU ARE COMING TOO?

631
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,733
>> I'M OKAY WITH,

632
00:17:27,733 --> 00:17:29,267
YOU KNOW, COMING AND STAYING

633
00:17:29,267 --> 00:17:30,333
THE NIGHT.

634
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,600
BUT I JUST DON'T THINK

635
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,133
FULLY I'M READY TO JUST

636
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:35,333
MOVE OUT.

637
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:38,400
>> I WON'T ALLOW YOU TO HAVE

638
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,067
THE BABY OR YOURSELF

639
00:17:40,067 --> 00:17:41,067
IN AN ENVIRONMENT

640
00:17:41,067 --> 00:17:42,700
THAT WOULD HARM YOU OR THE BABY.

641
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,067
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

642
00:17:45,067 --> 00:17:46,533
>> YOUR MOM'S GOT PROBLEMS.

643
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:49,700
PEOPLE I KNOW THAT WENT TO JAIL

644
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:51,833
CAME OUT OF JAIL,

645
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:52,933
DID THE SAME AMOUNT OF DRUGS

646
00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:53,967
THEY DID WHEN THEY WERE IN JAIL,

647
00:17:53,967 --> 00:17:54,867
AND DIED.

648
00:17:54,867 --> 00:17:55,733
>> BUT MY THING IS JUST,

649
00:17:55,733 --> 00:17:56,967
I WOULD LIKE YOU TO HAVE

650
00:17:56,967 --> 00:17:58,800
AN OPEN MIND ON THAT THERE

651
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,067
IS A CHANCE SHE CAN DO BETTER.

652
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:01,933
>> AND IF YOU'RE NOT

653
00:18:01,933 --> 00:18:04,933
DISAPPOINTED, AND SHE STEPS UP

654
00:18:04,933 --> 00:18:06,500
AND SHE'S A MOM TO YOU

655
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,067
AND A GRANDMOTHER TO YOU,

656
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:10,333
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU.

657
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,300
OKAY?

658
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,900
BUT I HAVE NO RESPECT FOR HER.

659
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,633
AND I'M SORRY.

660
00:18:14,633 --> 00:18:16,500
AND I THINK THAT'S FAIR.

661
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,067
>> AND I UNDERSTAND WHY--

662
00:18:18,067 --> 00:18:18,667
WHY THAT'S YOUR--

663
00:18:18,667 --> 00:18:20,067
>> OKAY, MY KIDS CAME FIRST.

664
00:18:20,067 --> 00:18:21,367
THEY ALWAYS CAME FIRST.

665
00:18:21,367 --> 00:18:22,467
YOU DON'T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT

666
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:24,367
A GROWN WOMAN THAT DOESN'T

667
00:18:24,367 --> 00:18:26,800
GIVE A [bleep] ABOUT HERSELF.

668
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,933
I FEEL THIS IS THE BEST

669
00:18:27,933 --> 00:18:31,100
ENVIRONMENT FOR THE BABY.

670
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:34,800
>> I FEEL THAT IT'S NOT.

671
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,133
I DON'T THINK THAT I WILL EVER

672
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:38,400
100% FULLY FEEL COMFORTABLE

673
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,733
WITH YOU BEING ALONE

674
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:42,633
WITH THE BABY.

675
00:18:42,633 --> 00:18:43,467
BECAUSE--

676
00:18:43,467 --> 00:18:44,500
>> GOOD.

677
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,100
>> I'VE SEEN PERSONALLY

678
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,100
EVERYTHING THAT YOU'VE GONE

679
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,667
THROUGH.

680
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:49,567
YOU HAVE STROKES.

681
00:18:49,567 --> 00:18:50,567
NOT YOUR FAULT.

682
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:51,867
BUT WHAT IF YOU WERE TO BE ALONE

683
00:18:51,867 --> 00:18:54,667
WITH THE BABY AND HAVE ONE?

684
00:18:54,667 --> 00:18:55,667
DO YOU SEE WHERE I'M COMING

685
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,100
FROM OR NOT REALLY?

686
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,300
>> NOPE.

687
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,633
>> IT DOESN'T WORRY YOU AT ALL

688
00:18:59,633 --> 00:19:01,833
THAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY--

689
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:02,933
>> NO, BECAUSE I KNOW WHEN

690
00:19:02,933 --> 00:19:04,300
I'M HAVING A STROKE, MILLINA.

691
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,233
THAT'S WHY I'M LIVING WITH MY

692
00:19:05,233 --> 00:19:05,900
FRIEND.

693
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:06,767
MY FRIEND WANTS TO TAKE CARE

694
00:19:06,767 --> 00:19:07,433
OF ME.

695
00:19:07,433 --> 00:19:08,600
IT'S YOUR KID.

696
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:09,900
DO WHAT YOU WANT WITH IT.

697
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,467
>> I'M TRYING TO

698
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:12,500
TALK TO YOU AND HAVE YOU--

699
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:13,867
>> YOU WERE HONEST.

700
00:19:13,867 --> 00:19:14,567
>> AND I DON'T--

701
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:15,367
>> YOU WERE HONEST ABOUT IT.

702
00:19:15,367 --> 00:19:16,300
>> I DON'T NOT WANT YOU AROUND

703
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:17,067
THE BABY.

704
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:17,800
>> HEY--

705
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,533
>> I DO.

706
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:19,533
I JUST DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE--

707
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:20,433
>> HEY, DO YOU KNOW WHAT?

708
00:19:20,433 --> 00:19:21,433
I HAVE BEEN NOTHING BUT THE BEST

709
00:19:21,433 --> 00:19:22,767
[bleep] MOTHER IN THIS

710
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:25,467
[bleep]DAMN WORLD.

711
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:26,900
>> I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU'RE

712
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,067
A BAD MOM, TINA.

713
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:29,400
>> THERE IS NOBODY IN THIS WORLD

714
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,167
THAT WOULDN'T TRUST ME

715
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:31,067
WITH THEIR [bleep] BABY.

716
00:19:31,067 --> 00:19:31,900
I'LL TELL YOU THAT RIGHT

717
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:32,667
[bleep] NOW!

718
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:33,667
>> I'M NOT SAYING I DON'T TRUST

719
00:19:33,667 --> 00:19:34,300
YOU WITH HIM.

720
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,133
I'M SAYING I DON'T FEEL

721
00:19:35,133 --> 00:19:36,300
COMFORTABLE WITH YOU BEING ALONE

722
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:37,467
WITH HIM.

723
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:39,067
>> THERE'S NOBODY IN THIS WORLD

724
00:19:39,067 --> 00:19:39,900
THAT WOULDN'T TRUST ME

725
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,667
WITH THEIR [bleep] BABY ALONE!

726
00:19:43,667 --> 00:19:46,767
>> NOW, I TRIED TO TALK TO YOU.

727
00:19:46,767 --> 00:19:47,733
BUT CLEARLY--

728
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:49,067
>> NO, YOU'VE JUST TOLD ME

729
00:19:49,067 --> 00:19:50,400
WHERE I STAND.

730
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,633
YOU DON'T TRUST ME ALONE

731
00:19:51,633 --> 00:19:52,633
WITH YOUR BABY.

732
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:55,067
THAT'S ALL YOU NEEDED TO SAY.

733
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:55,967
>> I'VE TRIED TO TELL YOU THAT

734
00:19:55,967 --> 00:19:56,633
BEFORE.

735
00:19:56,633 --> 00:19:57,800
>> GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR MOM!

736
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,967
I HOPE SHE CAN HELP YOU!

737
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:19,633
>> AFTER THINGS GOT SO CRAZY

738
00:20:19,633 --> 00:20:20,967
WITH TINA, TREVOR THOUGHT

739
00:20:20,967 --> 00:20:21,967
IT'D BE BEST FOR HIM TO STAY

740
00:20:21,967 --> 00:20:23,000
THERE AND SMOOTH THINGS OVER

741
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,533
WITH HER.

742
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:25,767
TREVOR'S MOM WENT COMPLETELY

743
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:27,067
APE[bleep] ON US.

744
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:28,233
SHE WAS LIKE, "BY THE WAY,

745
00:20:28,233 --> 00:20:29,567
WE'RE MOVING THIS WEEK."

746
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:31,433
AND SHE GOT THERE

747
00:20:31,433 --> 00:20:32,167
AND TALKED [bleep]

748
00:20:32,167 --> 00:20:33,067
ABOUT MY MOM.

749
00:20:33,067 --> 00:20:34,067
>> YOU KNOW, YOU JUST DON'T

750
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,633
BRING UP THAT SUBJECT TO HER.

751
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:36,733
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE--

752
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:37,800
>> NO, I DON'T BRING IT UP.

753
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,467
SHE DOES.

754
00:20:38,467 --> 00:20:39,333
>> I WOULD JUST--

755
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,200
I WOULD JUST TELL HER.

756
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,167
"YOU KNOW, I'D REALLY FEEL

757
00:20:41,167 --> 00:20:42,200
UNCOMFORTABLE TALKING

758
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,233
ABOUT THIS RIGHT NOW.

759
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:44,100
YOU KNOW, CAN WE TALK ABOUT

760
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,400
SOMETHING ELSE?"

761
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,300
>> RIGHT, SO I TOLD HER THAT

762
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,767
I DIDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE YET

763
00:20:47,767 --> 00:20:48,767
MOVING IN.

764
00:20:48,767 --> 00:20:51,233
SHE COMPLETELY BLEW UP.

765
00:20:51,233 --> 00:20:52,200
>> BUT WHAT DOES HE SAY?

766
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,567
>> HE'S TRYING TO MAKE UP

767
00:20:53,567 --> 00:20:54,433
WITH HIS MOM.

768
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:55,767
>> IT WOULD BE BETTER IF HE WAS

769
00:20:55,767 --> 00:20:57,367
HOME WITH YOU.

770
00:20:57,367 --> 00:20:58,533
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

771
00:20:58,533 --> 00:21:00,667
>> IT'S A SHAME BECAUSE THAT IS

772
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:02,667
TREVOR'S MOM, YOU KNOW,

773
00:21:02,667 --> 00:21:05,600
AND NO MATTER WHAT HE SAYS,

774
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,133
SHE BROUGHT HIM INTO THIS WORLD.

775
00:21:07,133 --> 00:21:07,933
HE LOVES HER.

776
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:08,800
>> RIGHT.

777
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,500
>> HE WANTS THAT ACCEPTANCE

778
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:11,433
FROM HER.

779
00:21:11,433 --> 00:21:13,300
>> I'M DONE TRYING TO GET HER

780
00:21:13,300 --> 00:21:14,233
TO LIKE ME.

781
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:17,267
I'M DONE TRYING TO CREATE

782
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:18,833
A RELATIONSHIP WITH HER.

783
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,833
I AM DONE TRYING.

784
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:21,900
IF I DECIDE, NO, HE'S NOT

785
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:22,600
GOING OVER THERE,

786
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,433
I'M KEEPING HIM,

787
00:21:23,433 --> 00:21:25,533
THE ONLY WAY THAT HE CAN HAVE

788
00:21:25,533 --> 00:21:27,167
ANY SAY IN IT IS IF HE TAKES

789
00:21:27,167 --> 00:21:28,600
ME TO COURT.

790
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,200
I HOPE TREVOR CAN UNDERSTAND

791
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:31,167
THAT IT MIGHT BE A WHILE

792
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:32,200
BEFORE I CAN DEAL WITH HIS

793
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:32,933
MOM AGAIN.

794
00:21:32,933 --> 00:21:33,800
I WANT TO TALK TO HIM

795
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:35,067
ABOUT IT, BUT IT MIGHT HAVE

796
00:21:35,067 --> 00:21:36,600
TO WAIT, BECAUSE I STARTED

797
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:39,100
HAVING CONTRACTIONS.

798
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:42,067
NAN, COME HERE!

799
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:42,800
>> I'M HERE.

800
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:43,500
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

801
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,700
>> UM, I'M PRETTY SURE

802
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,767
IT'S TIME TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL.

803
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:48,700
>> WHAT ARE YOU, FIVE MINUTES

804
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,400
APART?

805
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,233
>> YEAH, BETWEEN TWO AND FIVE.

806
00:21:53,967 --> 00:21:57,233
I'M PRETTY MUCH READY.

807
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,367
I TEXTED TREVOR ON THE WAY

808
00:21:58,367 --> 00:21:59,267
TO THE HOSPITAL,

809
00:21:59,267 --> 00:22:01,200
AND HE'S MEETING US THERE.

810
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,967
I AM IN SO MUCH PAIN RIGHT NOW.

811
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:10,433
I KNOW, MO.

812
00:22:11,267 --> 00:22:14,067
YEAH, IT'S GONNA SUCK.

813
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:15,233
THE DOCTORS MEASURED ME

814
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:16,333
AT 4 CENTIMETERS

815
00:22:16,333 --> 00:22:17,467
AND ADMITTED ME.

816
00:22:17,467 --> 00:22:18,467
I'M REALLY SAD THAT MY MOM'S

817
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:20,067
NOT HERE, AND IT GOT REALLY

818
00:22:20,067 --> 00:22:21,467
UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN I FOUND OUT

819
00:22:21,467 --> 00:22:22,433
THAT TINA WAS IN THE WAITING

820
00:22:22,433 --> 00:22:23,500
ROOM.

821
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:24,533
>> I HATE NOT KNOWING ANYTHING

822
00:22:24,533 --> 00:22:27,167
AND SITTING HERE.

823
00:22:28,700 --> 00:22:29,600
>> I DON'T GIVE A HELL WHO IT

824
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,267
IS.

825
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:31,533
I WILL KICK ANYBODY THE [bleep]

826
00:22:31,533 --> 00:22:32,600
OUT THAT MAKES THIS ANY MORE

827
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:33,767
STRESSFUL FOR ME THAN IT HAS

828
00:22:33,767 --> 00:22:35,933
TO BE.

829
00:22:35,933 --> 00:22:38,200
[breathing rhythmically]

830
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,867
AND AFTER HOURS OF PAINFUL

831
00:22:50,867 --> 00:22:52,367
CONTRACTIONS, IT WAS TIME

832
00:22:52,367 --> 00:22:54,800
TO PUSH.

833
00:22:56,567 --> 00:22:59,133
>> * TAKE IT ALL IN

834
00:22:59,133 --> 00:23:01,333
* TAKE IT ALL IN

835
00:23:01,333 --> 00:23:04,500
* NEVER FORGET THIS NIGHT

836
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:11,867
* TAKE IT ALL IN

837
00:23:11,867 --> 00:23:14,200
* TAKE IT ALL IN

838
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,400
* THIS IS WHAT LOVE'S *

839
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:18,833
* ALL ABOUT

840
00:23:33,467 --> 00:23:35,067
>> I GOT HOME A FEW DAYS AGO,

841
00:23:35,067 --> 00:23:35,933
AND TREVOR'S BEEN TRYING

842
00:23:35,933 --> 00:23:36,967
TO GET ME TO TAKE THE BABY

843
00:23:36,967 --> 00:23:38,200
OVER TO HIS HOUSE TO SEE

844
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,867
HIS MOM.

845
00:23:39,867 --> 00:23:40,933
BUT EVEN THOUGH I LET TINA

846
00:23:40,933 --> 00:23:41,933
MEET KAYDEN BRIEFLY

847
00:23:41,933 --> 00:23:43,167
AT THE HOSPITAL,

848
00:23:43,167 --> 00:23:44,267
I'M WORRIED THAT IF I GO OVER

849
00:23:44,267 --> 00:23:45,233
THERE, SHE COULD HAVE ANOTHER

850
00:23:45,233 --> 00:23:46,900
CRAZY OUTBURST.

851
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:49,100
SO I FINALLY GOT THE BABY

852
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,400
ASLEEP.

853
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,600
>> ABOUT TIME.

854
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,333
TIRED?

855
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:53,567
>> I'M EXHAUSTED.

856
00:23:53,567 --> 00:23:54,667
YOU KNOW, I DON'T GET THIS.

857
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:56,067
I REMEMBER WHEN I USED TO STAY

858
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,867
UP ON A DAILY BASIS FOR FUN.

859
00:23:57,867 --> 00:23:59,667
[laughs]

860
00:23:59,667 --> 00:24:00,867
>> NO MORE.

861
00:24:00,867 --> 00:24:01,933
>> NOW I'M JUST LIKE--

862
00:24:01,933 --> 00:24:02,867
>> SLEEP'S FUN.

863
00:24:02,867 --> 00:24:03,700
>> YEAH, I'M JUST LIKE,

864
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,300
LET ME SLEEP.

865
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:05,967
>> WELL, JUST THINK:

866
00:24:05,967 --> 00:24:06,933
HE WENT THROUGH THE MOST

867
00:24:06,933 --> 00:24:07,733
GRUESOME, HORRIFIC MOMENT

868
00:24:07,733 --> 00:24:09,267
OF HIS LIFE

869
00:24:09,267 --> 00:24:10,867
THAT HE'LL NEVER REMEMBER.

870
00:24:10,867 --> 00:24:11,733
>> YEAH, BUT THEN WHEN HE GETS

871
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:13,067
OLDER, IF HE'S ANYTHING

872
00:24:13,067 --> 00:24:14,133
LIKE HIS DAD, HE CAME OUT

873
00:24:14,133 --> 00:24:15,167
OF A WOMAN--HE'S GONNA SPEND

874
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:16,067
THE REST OF HIS LIFE TRYING

875
00:24:16,067 --> 00:24:17,133
TO GET BACK IN ONE.

876
00:24:17,133 --> 00:24:18,233
>> NOT ANYMORE.

877
00:24:18,233 --> 00:24:19,467
[snickers]

878
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:21,167
AFTER WHAT I SAW, I'M GOOD.

879
00:24:21,167 --> 00:24:22,600
>> WAS IT REALLY THAT BAD?

880
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,567
>> MM-HMM.

881
00:24:23,567 --> 00:24:26,467
AFTER WATCHING YOUR PRETTY

882
00:24:26,467 --> 00:24:29,500
VAGINA GO FROM A VAGINA

883
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:31,133
TO STARGATE AND A BABY COME

884
00:24:31,133 --> 00:24:33,467
FLYING OUT, IT KIND OF CHANGES

885
00:24:33,467 --> 00:24:34,867
THE BALL GAME.

886
00:24:34,867 --> 00:24:36,600
[cell phone chiming]

887
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,600
HELLO?

888
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:39,633
YES, LET ME CALL YOU BACK

889
00:24:39,633 --> 00:24:40,867
IN A FEW.

890
00:24:40,867 --> 00:24:42,400
LOVE YOU TOO.

891
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,400
BYE.

892
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,067
>> WHO WAS THAT?

893
00:24:44,067 --> 00:24:44,967
>> MY MOTHER.

894
00:24:44,967 --> 00:24:45,967
>> IS SHE OKAY?

895
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:47,133
>> YEAH, SHE'S FINE.

896
00:24:47,133 --> 00:24:47,867
>> OH, SHE SOUNDED LIKE

897
00:24:47,867 --> 00:24:48,600
SHE WAS UPSET.

898
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:50,367
>> NO, SHE'S FINE.

899
00:24:50,367 --> 00:24:51,900
SINCE SHE MOVED OUT OF THE

900
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:52,933
HOUSE, AND SINCE KAYDEN WAS

901
00:24:52,933 --> 00:24:56,600
BORN, MOM IS...

902
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:57,600
DOING BETTER

903
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,067
AND SHE'S REALLY TRYING

904
00:24:59,067 --> 00:25:01,400
TO GET RID OF ALL THE,

905
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,267
YOU KNOW, NEGATIVE THINGS

906
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:03,567
THAT HAVE HAPPENED

907
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:04,433
AND TRYING TO MOVE PAST

908
00:25:04,433 --> 00:25:05,500
THEM ALL.

909
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,700
>> EVEN THOUGH SHE'S,

910
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:08,533
LIKE, BETTER, THOUGH, LIKE,

911
00:25:08,533 --> 00:25:09,967
I'M SO KIND OF WORRIED

912
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:11,700
SHE'S GONNA FREAK OUT AGAIN.

913
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:13,833
>> RIGHT, BUT, I MEAN,

914
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:15,533
RIGHT NOW SHE

915
00:25:15,533 --> 00:25:17,100
SEEMS LIKE HER OLD SELF AGAIN.

916
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,067
SO, I MEAN, THE ONLY WAY

917
00:25:18,067 --> 00:25:19,900
YOU CAN REALLY, YOU KNOW,

918
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:20,967
MAKE THE ASSESSMENT YOURSELF

919
00:25:20,967 --> 00:25:24,733
IS BY SEEING HER YOURSELF.

920
00:25:24,733 --> 00:25:25,567
>> I DON'T WANT HER TO SEE

921
00:25:25,567 --> 00:25:26,767
THE BABY TILL HE GETS A LITTLE

922
00:25:26,767 --> 00:25:27,500
BIT OLDER.

923
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,233
>> WELL, HOW LONG ARE WE

924
00:25:28,233 --> 00:25:29,067
TALKING?

925
00:25:29,067 --> 00:25:29,700
>> I DON'T KNOW.

926
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,633
I'M TRYING TO COME UP

927
00:25:30,633 --> 00:25:31,500
WITH A SOLUTION THAT'S GOOD

928
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:32,467
FOR EVERYBODY, AND IT SEEMS

929
00:25:32,467 --> 00:25:33,267
LIKE IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH

930
00:25:33,267 --> 00:25:34,467
FOR YOU.

931
00:25:34,467 --> 00:25:35,633
>> I NEVER SAID THAT.

932
00:25:35,633 --> 00:25:36,567
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

933
00:25:36,567 --> 00:25:39,267
I KNOW WHAT YOUR PLANS ARE.

934
00:25:39,267 --> 00:25:40,233
>> IT'S REALLY HARD TO DEAL

935
00:25:40,233 --> 00:25:41,300
WITH ALL OF THE SITUATIONS

936
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,867
AT ONE TIME, SO I'M JUST KIND OF

937
00:25:42,867 --> 00:25:44,867
TRYING TO FOCUS ON KAYDEN

938
00:25:44,867 --> 00:25:46,167
AND THEN FOCUS ON EVERYTHING

939
00:25:46,167 --> 00:25:48,367
ELSE.

940

00:32:22,667 --> 00:32:23,500
>> [chuckles]

1126
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,233
WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME

1127
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,800
YOU GOT OUT WITHOUT THE BABY?

1128
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:26,567
>> NEVER.

1129
00:32:26,567 --> 00:32:27,567
>> SERIOUSLY?

1130
00:32:27,567 --> 00:32:28,267
>> YEAH.

1131
00:32:28,267 --> 00:32:29,633
>> [laughing] OH, MY GOD.

1132
00:32:29,633 --> 00:32:30,433
>> YOU'VE BEEN SPENDING

1133
00:32:30,433 --> 00:32:31,367
SO MUCH TIME THINKING ABOUT

1134
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:33,333
YOUR MOM AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

1135
00:32:33,333 --> 00:32:34,533
HAVE YOU EVEN, LIKE, THOUGHT

1136
00:32:34,533 --> 00:32:35,867
ABOUT MAYBE, LIKE, GOING BACK

1137
00:32:35,867 --> 00:32:37,833
TO SCHOOL OR--

1138
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:38,833
>> I WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL,

1139
00:32:38,833 --> 00:32:40,233
BUT IF THAT CAN'T BE FIGURED

1140
00:32:40,233 --> 00:32:41,500
OUT, I'M DEFINITELY GONNA GET

1141
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,500
MY G.E.D.

1142
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,233
NOW WE JUST GOT TO FIGURE OUT

1143
00:32:45,233 --> 00:32:47,867
WHAT TO DO WITH TREVOR.

1144
00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:49,500
>> HOW OFTEN DOES HE EVEN

1145
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,100
SEE KAYDEN?

1146
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:54,200
>> HE HASN'T COME OVER.

1147
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,967
>> LIKE, AT ALL?

1148
00:32:55,967 --> 00:32:57,733
>> I THINK MAYBE ONCE OR TWICE.

1149
00:32:57,733 --> 00:32:58,667
>> WHAT?

1150
00:32:58,667 --> 00:33:00,167
THAT'S AWESOME.

1151
00:33:00,167 --> 00:33:01,133
DO YOU EVER BRING KAYDEN OVER

1152
00:33:01,133 --> 00:33:02,700
TO TREVOR'S?

1153
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,933
>> WELL, THE LAST TIME I WENT

1154
00:33:03,933 --> 00:33:06,667
OVER THERE, HIS MOM

1155
00:33:06,667 --> 00:33:09,533
COMPLETELY FREAKED.

1156
00:33:09,533 --> 00:33:10,567
AND THEN SHE STARTED SCREAMING

1157
00:33:10,567 --> 00:33:11,467
AND YELLING.

1158
00:33:11,467 --> 00:33:12,467
AND I DON'T WANT KAYDEN AROUND

1159
00:33:12,467 --> 00:33:13,300
THAT.

1160
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,300
THERE'S NO COMMUNICATING WITH

1161
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,100
HER.

1162
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,167
IT'S ALWAYS HER.

1163
00:33:16,167 --> 00:33:17,233
>> SHE'S JUST LIKE--

1164
00:33:17,233 --> 00:33:18,067
LIKE, SHE DOESN'T ACTUALLY

1165
00:33:18,067 --> 00:33:19,800
LISTEN TO YOUR INPUT.

1166
00:33:19,800 --> 00:33:20,767
SHE JUST--

1167
00:33:20,767 --> 00:33:22,500
>> IT'S HER WAY OR--

1168
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,233
>> THE HIGHWAY?

1169
00:33:23,233 --> 00:33:23,900
>> YEAH.

1170
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:24,600
>> YEAH.

1171
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:25,400
THE WAY YOU JUST DESCRIBED

1172
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,367
HOW HIS MOM ACTS,

1173
00:33:26,367 --> 00:33:28,067
I DON'T GET WHY TREVOR

1174
00:33:28,067 --> 00:33:29,367
WOULDN'T, LIKE, WANT

1175
00:33:29,367 --> 00:33:31,133
TO, LIKE, LEAVE THAT

1176
00:33:31,133 --> 00:33:32,733
AND, LIKE, COME AND STAY

1177
00:33:32,733 --> 00:33:34,767
WITH YOU AND HIS SON.

1178
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:36,133
>> YOU KNOW, HE'S NOT COMING

1179
00:33:36,133 --> 00:33:37,233
OVER.

1180
00:33:37,233 --> 00:33:39,500
IT'S MORE, "YOU COME OVER."

1181
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,067
IT'S LIKE WE'RE BEST FRIENDS

1182
00:33:41,067 --> 00:33:43,200
THAT GOT DRUNK, HAD AN "UH-OH,"

1183
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:46,733
AND NOW WE HAVE A BIG "UH-OH."

1184
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:47,500
I JUST WANT HIM TO BE THERE

1185
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:49,067
FOR HIS KID.

1186
00:33:49,067 --> 00:33:51,967
>> EXACTLY.

1187
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:55,400
>> KAYDEN CAME DOWN WITH A COLD

1188
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,167
AFTER I TOOK HIM TO THE

1189
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:59,200
COURTHOUSE.

1190
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:00,933
[baby crying]

1191
00:34:00,933 --> 00:34:01,900
>> YOU'RE LIKE THE LONE RANGER

1192
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,067
OVER HERE, EH?

1193
00:34:03,067 --> 00:34:05,833
>> YEAH.

1194
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,633
AND I DON'T LIKE HOW DISTANT

1195
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:11,067
TREVOR AND I HAVE BECOME.

1196
00:34:11,067 --> 00:34:13,867
I'M RUNNING OUT OF OPTIONS.

1197
00:34:13,867 --> 00:34:15,333
[door squeaking]

1198
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:17,067
>> OH, HI, HANDSOME.

1199
00:34:17,067 --> 00:34:17,833
>> [chuckles]

1200
00:34:17,833 --> 00:34:19,067
YEAH, COME TO DADDY.

1201
00:34:19,067 --> 00:34:20,233
>> HE'S BEAUTIFUL.

1202
00:34:20,233 --> 00:34:21,767
I'M IN LOVE WITH HIM.

1203
00:34:21,767 --> 00:34:24,267
>> AW.

1204
00:34:24,267 --> 00:34:25,233
>> YOU DON'T REALLY REALIZE

1205
00:34:25,233 --> 00:34:26,533
HOW HARD IT IS ACTUALLY

1206
00:34:26,533 --> 00:34:28,667
TAKING CARE OF HIM.

1207
00:34:28,667 --> 00:34:30,467
I'M DOING IT ALL BY MYSELF NOW.

1208
00:34:30,467 --> 00:34:32,433
IT'S LIKE, HOW OFTEN HAVE

1209
00:34:32,433 --> 00:34:34,833
WE SEEN EACH OTHER?

1210
00:34:37,267 --> 00:34:38,067
>> I KNOW I WAS SUPPOSED

1211
00:34:38,067 --> 00:34:39,133
TO, LIKE, YOU KNOW,

1212
00:34:39,133 --> 00:34:42,067
BE OVER MORE, BUT I DON'T KNOW.

1213
00:34:42,067 --> 00:34:43,533
I MEAN, LIKE, I THINK HE'S

1214
00:34:43,533 --> 00:34:44,533
BETTER OFF HERE.

1215
00:34:44,533 --> 00:34:45,467
IT'S JUST, HERE THERE'S MORE

1216
00:34:45,467 --> 00:34:48,400
PEOPLE TO HELP YOU.

1217
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:49,267
>> YOU ARE ALWAYS WELCOME

1218
00:34:49,267 --> 00:34:50,167
TO COME HERE.

1219
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:51,533
AND I HAVE ACCOMMODATIONS

1220
00:34:51,533 --> 00:34:52,800
FOR THE BABY HERE.

1221
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,600
>> I FEEL LIKE IF YOU'RE

1222
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,233
GONNA GO AND NOT BE NICE TO ME,

1223
00:34:57,233 --> 00:34:58,400
WHY WOULD I WANT TO BE AROUND?

1224
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,200
>> I HAVE NEVER--

1225
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:00,100
>> WHY WOULD I WANT MY CHILD--

1226
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:00,967
>> I HAVE NEVER NOT BEEN NICE

1227
00:35:00,967 --> 00:35:03,067
TO YOU.

1228
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:04,900
[baby crying]

1229
00:35:04,900 --> 00:35:06,133
I FEEL LIKE I DIDN'T GET

1230
00:35:06,133 --> 00:35:07,100
A CHANCE TO BOND WITH

1231
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,433
MY GRANDCHILD,

1232
00:35:08,433 --> 00:35:10,533
AND THAT IT'S--

1233
00:35:10,533 --> 00:35:11,333
YOU'RE NOT SHARING.

1234
00:35:11,333 --> 00:35:13,100
I DON'T FEEL YOU'RE SHARING.

1235
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,100
>> BUT I WASN'T GONNA TAKE

1236
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,933
HIM OUT WHILE HE WAS SICK.

1237
00:35:15,933 --> 00:35:17,300
I WAITED UNTIL HE GOT BETTER,

1238
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,600
AND THEN WE CAME OVER.

1239
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:20,833
>> SOUNDS LIKE A LOT OF EXCUSES.

1240
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:22,400
>> IT'S NOT EVEN EXCUSES.

1241
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,667
IT'S WHAT'S ACTUALLY GOING ON.

1242
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:27,067
>> HE WENT TO SEE YOUR MOTHER.

1243
00:35:27,067 --> 00:35:28,467
>> AND THAT'S WHERE HE GOT SICK.

1244
00:35:28,467 --> 00:35:29,933
>> OKAY, WELL, WAS THAT

1245
00:35:29,933 --> 00:35:31,233
A GOOD CHOICE?

1246
00:35:31,233 --> 00:35:32,067
>> WELL, I'M PRETTY SURE

1247
00:35:32,067 --> 00:35:33,833
THAT BABY HAS NO IMMUNE SYSTEM.

1248
00:35:33,833 --> 00:35:35,400
I WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE THAT.

1249
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,233
>> YEAH, BUT THAT WAS THE ONLY

1250
00:35:36,233 --> 00:35:37,367
WAY HE COULD HAVE SEEN MY MOM,

1251
00:35:37,367 --> 00:35:38,067
SO I BROUGHT HIM--

1252
00:35:38,067 --> 00:35:39,133
>> SEND THEM A PICTURE.

1253
00:35:39,133 --> 00:35:39,833
>> YOU CAN'T.

1254
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:40,567
>> SHE PUT HERSELF THERE.

1255
00:35:40,567 --> 00:35:41,200
>> SEND A POSTCARD.

1256
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:41,933
>> SHE PUT HERSELF THERE.

1257
00:35:41,933 --> 00:35:42,767
>> YOU CAN'T SEND PICTURES.

1258
00:35:42,767 --> 00:35:43,433
>> I AGREE WITH TINA.

1259
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:44,567
>> SHE PUT HERSELF THERE.

1260
00:35:44,567 --> 00:35:46,067
>> SHE DID IT TO HERSELF.

1261
00:35:46,067 --> 00:35:48,200
>> AND QUIT ENABLING--

1262
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:48,967
>> YEAH.

1263
00:35:48,967 --> 00:35:51,533
>> I'M NOT ENABLING ANYTHING.

1264
00:35:51,533 --> 00:35:53,100
>> HE'S IN THE SAME PREDICAMENT

1265
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:54,300
AS HE'S IN THERE.

1266
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,367
>> DON'T BE MAD AT THE BABY.

1267
00:35:55,367 --> 00:35:56,300
>> I'M NOT. I'M BURPING HIM.

1268
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:57,067
>> CAN I HOLD THE BABY

1269
00:35:57,067 --> 00:36:00,067
AND BURP HIM?

1270
00:36:00,067 --> 00:36:01,500
>> IT'S A LOSING SITUATION--

1271
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:02,367
>> I'M NOT TRYING TO MAKE YOU

1272
00:36:02,367 --> 00:36:03,100
ANGRY.

1273
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:06,167
I'M TRYING TO TALK TO YOU.

1274
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,600
TALK TO ME.

1275
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:11,367
>> I DON'T EVEN--

1276
00:36:11,367 --> 00:36:12,433
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

1277
00:36:12,433 --> 00:36:13,733
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY.

1278
00:36:13,733 --> 00:36:14,400
>> DO YOU WANT TO TALK

1279
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,633
PRIVATELY TO ME?

1280
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:16,767
>> NO, IT'S JUST, I SERIOUSLY

1281
00:36:16,767 --> 00:36:19,067
DON'T...

1282
00:36:19,067 --> 00:36:22,133
>> MILLINA, I WANT TO HELP YOU,

1283
00:36:22,133 --> 00:36:23,733
AND OFFERING YOU MY LOVE.

1284
00:36:23,733 --> 00:36:25,133
I UNDERSTAND YOU DIDN'T HAVE

1285
00:36:25,133 --> 00:36:26,367
A LOT OF LOVE, MILLINA,

1286
00:36:26,367 --> 00:36:29,600
AND I'M OFFERING YOU MY LOVE.

1287
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:31,133
THAT'S ALL.

1288
00:36:31,133 --> 00:36:32,600
I JUST HAVE EVERYBODY GANGING UP

1289
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:34,733
ON ME.

1290
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:45,833
>> DON'T GO AWAY.

1291
00:36:45,833 --> 00:36:46,867
THIS EPISODE OF 16 AND PREGNANT 

1292
00:36:46,867 --> 00:36:49,100
CONTINUES RIGHT NOW.

1293
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:52,167
>> IT REALLY HURTS

1294
00:36:52,167 --> 00:36:53,133
THAT NOBODY UNDERSTANDS

1295
00:36:53,133 --> 00:36:54,733
WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH.

1296
00:36:54,733 --> 00:36:57,267
NOT EVEN TREVOR.

1297
00:37:00,333 --> 00:37:01,200
>> HOLA.

1298
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,633
>> [laughs]

1299
00:37:03,633 --> 00:37:04,933
>> WHAT'S BUGGING YOU?

1300
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:08,233
>> I HATE HOW PEOPLE CHANGE.

1301
00:37:08,233 --> 00:37:12,100
>> SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT.

1302
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:13,100
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

1303
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:15,967
I MEAN, I'M TRYING TO MAKE

1304
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:19,100
EVERYBODY HAPPY, AND...

1305
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,067
SEEMS LIKE IN THE END,

1306
00:37:20,067 --> 00:37:22,067
