1
00:00:03,307 --> 00:00:04,917
>> [laughs]

2
00:00:04,917 --> 00:00:06,789
HI, MY NAME IS JENNIFER.

3
00:00:06,789 --> 00:00:07,790
KITTY CAT, COME ON.

4
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:09,487
I'M 16, AND I LIVE RIGHT OUTSIDE

5
00:00:09,487 --> 00:00:11,968
TAMPA, FLORIDA, WITH MY MOM,

6
00:00:11,968 --> 00:00:12,882
DAD, AND LITTLE BROTHER,

7
00:00:12,882 --> 00:00:14,014
ANTONIO.

8
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,276
MOST GIRLS IN MY HIGH SCHOOL

9
00:00:15,276 --> 00:00:16,625
SPEND THEIR WEEKENDS SHOPPING.

10
00:00:16,625 --> 00:00:18,148
LORD, HAVE MERCY.

11
00:00:18,148 --> 00:00:19,671
BUT IN MY FREE TIME, I'D RATHER

12
00:00:19,671 --> 00:00:20,411
BE AT THE BATTING CAGES OR

13
00:00:20,411 --> 00:00:22,022
PLAYING SPORTS WITH MY FAMILY.

14
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:22,935
>> THERE YOU GO.

15
00:00:22,935 --> 00:00:24,067
LAST ONE.

16
00:00:24,067 --> 00:00:25,503
>> WE'RE SUPER CLOSE, AND

17
00:00:25,503 --> 00:00:27,027
NOTHING EVER GETS BETWEEN US...

18
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:27,897
>> GET IT, SCOOTER.

19
00:00:27,897 --> 00:00:28,941
CATCH IT.

20
00:00:28,941 --> 00:00:29,507
>> EXCEPT FOR MAYBE

21
00:00:29,507 --> 00:00:30,291
MY BOYFRIEND, JOSH.

22
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,074
I WON.

23
00:00:31,074 --> 00:00:32,249
YOU GOT TO TAKE ME TO GO

24
00:00:32,249 --> 00:00:33,816
GET MY NAILS DONE.

25
00:00:33,816 --> 00:00:35,209
WE MET UP AT SCHOOL

26
00:00:35,209 --> 00:00:36,079
AND HAVE BEEN GOING OUT

27
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,211
FOR OVER A YEAR.

28
00:00:37,211 --> 00:00:39,213
BOY, ARE YOU AN OLD FART.

29
00:00:39,213 --> 00:00:40,344
BUT MY MOM AND DAD DON'T LIKE

30
00:00:40,344 --> 00:00:41,998
JOSH, BECAUSE HE'S TOO OLD

31
00:00:41,998 --> 00:00:42,564
FOR ME.

32
00:00:42,564 --> 00:00:44,131
THEY THINK HE'S DISRESPECTFUL,

33
00:00:44,131 --> 00:00:45,784
AND IN THEIR EYES, NO GUY

34
00:00:45,784 --> 00:00:46,785
IS GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEIR

35
00:00:46,785 --> 00:00:47,830
LITTLE GIRL.

36
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:48,787
MY PARENTS ARE ABOUT TO HAVE

37
00:00:48,787 --> 00:00:50,224
TWO MORE REASONS NOT TO LIKE

38
00:00:50,224 --> 00:00:52,574
JOSH BECAUSE...

39
00:00:52,574 --> 00:00:55,359
JOSH BECAUSE...
I'M PREGNANT WITH TWINS.

40
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:03,280
I'M PREGNANT WITH TWINS.

41
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,151
EVEN THOUGH MY BELLY IS HUGE

42
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:06,240
NOW, THE SHOCK OF BEING PREGNANT

43
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,242
HASN'T COMPLETELY WORN OFF ON ME

44
00:01:08,242 --> 00:01:10,287
OR MY PARENTS.

45
00:01:10,287 --> 00:01:13,899
IT DIDN'T HIT ME FOR A WHILE.

46
00:01:13,899 --> 00:01:14,465
>> WHAT?

47
00:01:14,465 --> 00:01:15,336
THAT YOU WERE PREGNANT?

48
00:01:15,336 --> 00:01:15,988
>> YEAH.

49
00:01:15,988 --> 00:01:17,555
>> I'LL NEVER FORGET

50
00:01:17,555 --> 00:01:20,036
THAT FIRST SONOGRAM.

51
00:01:20,036 --> 00:01:20,993
>> WHEN WE FOUND OUT I WAS

52
00:01:20,993 --> 00:01:22,125
HAVING TWINS?

53
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:23,257
NEITHER WILL I.

54
00:01:23,257 --> 00:01:24,432
SHE ALMOST HAD A HEART ATTACK.

55
00:01:24,432 --> 00:01:25,215
>> I DID.

56
00:01:25,215 --> 00:01:26,260
>> I KEPT TELLING HER,

57
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:27,087
"CHECK AGAIN."

58
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:28,218
>> WE DIDN'T WANT THIS FOR YOU

59
00:01:28,218 --> 00:01:30,133
YET, BUT IT HAPPENED.

60
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:31,091
>> YEAH.

61
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,092
ANTONIO, ARE YOU OKAY WITH

62
00:01:32,092 --> 00:01:34,006
THIS CONVERSATION OR NOT?

63
00:01:34,006 --> 00:01:35,138
>> I'M ALL RIGHT.

64
00:01:35,138 --> 00:01:36,139
BUT, HEY, IF YOU GUYS WANT ME

65
00:01:36,139 --> 00:01:37,140
TO LEAVE...

66
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,054
[laughter]

67
00:01:38,054 --> 00:01:39,273
>> HE LOOKS BORED.

68
00:01:39,273 --> 00:01:41,101
[laughs]

69
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,755
ARE WE GONNA HAVE A BABY SHOWER?

70
00:01:43,755 --> 00:01:45,366
>> I'M NOT TOO SURE.

71
00:01:45,366 --> 00:01:47,977
AND WE GOT BACK-TO-SCHOOL

72
00:01:47,977 --> 00:01:50,197
GOING ON NOW AND...

73
00:01:50,197 --> 00:01:51,502
>> I DON'T WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL.

74
00:01:51,502 --> 00:01:53,025
>> MM-HMM.

75
00:01:53,025 --> 00:01:55,071
>> HMM...

76
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:57,117
WITH ONLY THREE WEEKS OF SUMMER

77
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,553
BEFORE MY SOPHOMORE YEAR,

78
00:01:58,553 --> 00:01:59,989
WE DON'T HAVE THAT LONG TO GET

79
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:01,208
EVERYTHING WE NEED BEFORE

80
00:02:01,208 --> 00:02:01,947
THE BABIES ARE HERE.

81
00:02:01,947 --> 00:02:03,732
>> OKAY, NOW OPEN.

82
00:02:03,732 --> 00:02:04,994
SEE?

83
00:02:04,994 --> 00:02:05,560
BRAND-NEW CAR SEATS.

84
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:06,691
>> OH, THEY'RE CUTE.

85
00:02:06,691 --> 00:02:09,868
>> AND THIS IS THE CRIB.

86
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:10,521
DID YOU EVER THINK, A YEAR

87
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:11,305
LATER, I'D BE SHOWING YOU

88
00:02:11,305 --> 00:02:12,393
A CRIB?

89
00:02:12,393 --> 00:02:13,394
>> NO.

90
00:02:13,394 --> 00:02:15,526
I MEAN, MY LIFE WOULD BE

91
00:02:15,526 --> 00:02:16,962
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

92
00:02:16,962 --> 00:02:18,529
IF I WASN'T PREGNANT.

93
00:02:18,529 --> 00:02:19,182
>> WHAT DID YOU THINK OF ME

94
00:02:19,182 --> 00:02:21,184
WHEN YOU FIRST MET ME?

95
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:22,054
>> WELL, I SAW YOU IN

96
00:02:22,054 --> 00:02:23,360
THE HALLWAY.

97
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,927
>> THEN YOU ASKED ME OUT.

98
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:26,233
>> UH-UH.

99
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:27,451
YOU SAID, "YOU GONNA BE

100
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:28,626
MY GIRL?"

101
00:02:28,626 --> 00:02:30,062
AND I SAID, "WHAT?"

102
00:02:30,062 --> 00:02:30,759
>> I'M NOT SURE THAT'S

103
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:31,542
HOW IT WENT DOWN.

104
00:02:31,542 --> 00:02:32,630
>> YEAH.

105
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:34,415
>> SO YOU LIKE THIS CRIB?

106
00:02:34,415 --> 00:02:36,417
>> YEAH, I'D SLEEP IN IT.

107
00:02:36,417 --> 00:02:37,200
>> I THINK YOU COULD SLEEP

108
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,201
IN THIS.

109
00:02:38,201 --> 00:02:40,638
>> [laughs]

110
00:02:40,638 --> 00:02:42,205
EVER SINCE I GOT PREGNANT,

111
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:43,772
OUR DATES HAVE MOSTLY BEEN

112
00:02:43,772 --> 00:02:45,208
TO DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS,

113
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,427
SO I'M HAPPY TO GO OUT WITH JOSH

114
00:02:46,427 --> 00:02:47,558
WHEN I CAN.

115
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:50,866
>> [laughs]

116
00:02:50,866 --> 00:02:53,042
>> [laughs]

117
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:54,739
THIS ONE'S EASY, JOSH.

118
00:02:54,739 --> 00:02:58,352
[laughter]

119
00:02:58,352 --> 00:03:00,180
I'D BRING OUR KIDS HERE.

120
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:00,963
>> WE COULD HAVE THEIR FIRST

121
00:03:00,963 --> 00:03:01,964
BIRTHDAY PARTY HERE.

122
00:03:01,964 --> 00:03:03,748
>> [laughs]

123
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:04,749
>> IS IT SCARY KNOWING

124
00:03:04,749 --> 00:03:05,968
TWO ARE COMING?

125
00:03:05,968 --> 00:03:07,187
>> YEAH, IT SCARED ME.

126
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,405
I THOUGHT I WOULD HAVE

127
00:03:08,405 --> 00:03:10,407
ONE LITTLE CREATURE IN ME,

128
00:03:10,407 --> 00:03:11,365
NOT TWO.

129
00:03:11,365 --> 00:03:12,801
I DIDN'T KNOW MUCH

130
00:03:12,801 --> 00:03:15,325
ABOUT BIRTH CONTROL.

131
00:03:15,325 --> 00:03:16,892
I WAS LIKE, "YOU SHOULD USE

132
00:03:16,892 --> 00:03:19,590
A CONDOM."

133
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,461
AND THEN YOU SAID

134
00:03:20,461 --> 00:03:21,984
YOU DIDN'T HAVE MONEY.

135
00:03:21,984 --> 00:03:22,767
>> THAT WAS JUST AN EXCUSE,

136
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:23,333
THOUGH.

137
00:03:23,333 --> 00:03:24,421
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO BUY NONE.

138
00:03:24,421 --> 00:03:25,030
>> WHY?

139
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:25,901
>> IT'S AWKWARD, GOING IN THERE

140
00:03:25,901 --> 00:03:27,207
AND BUYING CONDOMS.

141
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:29,644
>> UH, IT'S AWKWARD FOR ME

142
00:03:29,644 --> 00:03:32,386
>> UH, IT'S AWKWARD FOR ME
TO WALK AROUND WITH A BIG BELLY.

143
00:03:32,386 --> 00:03:34,866
TO WALK AROUND WITH A BIG BELLY.

144
00:03:34,866 --> 00:03:35,824
[chime dings]

145
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:37,478
WE'RE HAVING FRATERNAL TWINS

146
00:03:37,478 --> 00:03:39,044
AND ARE NAMING THEM NOAH

147
00:03:39,044 --> 00:03:40,611
AND JOSHUA JUNIOR.

148
00:03:40,611 --> 00:03:42,047
MY PARENTS WEREN'T CRAZY ABOUT

149
00:03:42,047 --> 00:03:43,266
US NAMING ONE OF THE BABIES

150
00:03:43,266 --> 00:03:45,050
AFTER JOSH, AND WHEN I TOLD MY

151
00:03:45,050 --> 00:03:46,617
MOM AND DAD WE WANTED THE TWINS

152
00:03:46,617 --> 00:03:49,054
TO HAVE HIS LAST NAME TOO,

153
00:03:49,054 --> 00:03:51,274
THEY WERE REALLY NOT HAPPY.

154
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:53,972
>> AS FAR AS THE NAME ISSUE,

155
00:03:53,972 --> 00:03:55,670
WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT YOU.

156
00:03:55,670 --> 00:03:57,106
IF THEY'RE IN HIS NAME,

157
00:03:57,106 --> 00:03:58,238
THAT GIVES HIM, YOU KNOW,

158
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,327
A LITTLE MORE JURISDICTION.

159
00:04:00,327 --> 00:04:01,458
THAT'S A, YOU KNOW, TREASURE

160
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,678
THAT'S EARNED, YOU KNOW,

161
00:04:03,678 --> 00:04:05,419
THAT HE HAS TO EARN.

162
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:07,638
>> HE JUST WANTS TO HEAR YOU

163
00:04:07,638 --> 00:04:10,511
GUYS SAY IT IS MY CHOICE.

164
00:04:10,511 --> 00:04:11,338
HE DOESN'T WANT TO HEAR YOU GUYS

165
00:04:11,338 --> 00:04:12,904
SAY YOU'RE MAKING IT FOR ME.

166
00:04:12,904 --> 00:04:13,557
>> AND THAT'S PROBABLY

167
00:04:13,557 --> 00:04:14,558
THE NORMAL REACTION,

168
00:04:14,558 --> 00:04:16,995
BUT THEN THE NEXT REACTION

169
00:04:16,995 --> 00:04:19,171
WOULD BE, WE'RE THE ADULTS HERE.

170
00:04:19,171 --> 00:04:20,303
AND IT'S LIKE, "DUDE, YOU KNOW,

171
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:21,739
YOU GOT MY DAUGHTER PREGNANT.

172
00:04:21,739 --> 00:04:23,175
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE LUCKY

173
00:04:23,175 --> 00:04:24,525
YOU'RE STANDING IN FRONT OF ME

174
00:04:24,525 --> 00:04:25,917
FOR WHAT YOU DID."

175
00:04:25,917 --> 00:04:28,355
I CAN'T JUST ACCEPT HIM.

176
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:31,532
>> YOU'RE ONLY 16 YEARS OLD.

177
00:04:31,532 --> 00:04:33,490
AND IF HE DOESN'T GET THAT,

178
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:34,361
WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE

179
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:35,579
TO BUMP HEADS.

180
00:04:35,579 --> 00:04:37,277
>> I UNDERSTAND BOTH SIDES,

181
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,670
AND IT LEAVES ME IN THE MIDDLE.

182
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:43,457
>> THIS IS A STAGE IN YOUR LIFE.

183
00:04:43,457 --> 00:04:44,675
FIVE YEARS AGO, YOU WERE

184
00:04:44,675 --> 00:04:46,895
THINKING ABOUT BARBIES.

185
00:04:46,895 --> 00:04:48,549
BELIEVE YOU ME, THREE YEARS FROM

186
00:04:48,549 --> 00:04:50,551
NOW, YOU'RE GONNA BE THINKING

187
00:04:50,551 --> 00:04:51,465
DIFFERENT.

188
00:04:51,465 --> 00:04:54,337
>> IT'S NOT ABOUT HIM.

189
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:55,991
IT'S ABOUT THE TWO KIDS

190
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:58,428
IT'S ABOUT THE TWO KIDS
IN YOUR STOMACH THERE.

191
00:04:58,428 --> 00:04:59,995
IN YOUR STOMACH THERE.

192
00:04:59,995 --> 00:05:01,344
>> I REALLY NEED TO FIGURE OUT

193
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:02,954
HOW TO HANDLE THE ISSUES

194
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:04,608
BETWEEN MY PARENTS AND JOSH.

195
00:05:04,608 --> 00:05:06,393
>> HOW ARE YOU AND JOSH?

196
00:05:06,393 --> 00:05:07,785
>> OKAY.

197
00:05:07,785 --> 00:05:09,439
WELL, LIKE, MY PARENTS DON'T

198
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,354
THINK IT'S RIGHT THAT THE KIDS

199
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:12,486
SHOULD HAVE HIS LAST NAME.

200
00:05:12,486 --> 00:05:14,139
>> BUT YOU WANT THEM TO HAVE

201
00:05:14,139 --> 00:05:16,751
HIS LAST NAME?

202
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:17,752
>> IT'S STRESSFUL,

203
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:20,320
LIKE, BEING IN THE MIDDLE

204
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,452
OF ALL OF THEM.

205
00:05:22,452 --> 00:05:23,235
>> SO HOW IS THAT SUPPOSED

206
00:05:23,235 --> 00:05:26,935
TO WORK WHEN THEY GET HERE?

207
00:05:26,935 --> 00:05:27,936
[laughter]

208
00:05:27,936 --> 00:05:28,937
>> I DON'T KNOW.

209
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:31,374
HE NEEDS TO CALL THEM UP

210
00:05:31,374 --> 00:05:33,158
AND JUST TALK.

211
00:05:33,158 --> 00:05:34,551
>> DO YOU THINK HE'LL ACTUALLY

212
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:35,335
TRY TO?

213
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,379
>> HE WOULDN'T WANT TO,

214
00:05:36,379 --> 00:05:39,251
>> HE WOULDN'T WANT TO,
BUT HOPEFULLY HE WILL.

215
00:05:39,251 --> 00:05:45,736
BUT HOPEFULLY HE WILL.

216
00:05:45,736 --> 00:05:47,521
I THINK YOU GUYS SHOULD TALK.

217
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:49,479
>> ABOUT WHAT?

218
00:05:49,479 --> 00:05:51,568
>> ABOUT EVERYTHING.

219
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:52,352
>> THEY'RE THE ONES MAKING

220
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,483
THE BIG ISSUE OUT OF IT.

221
00:05:53,483 --> 00:05:54,484
I'M SO DISRESPECTFUL

222
00:05:54,484 --> 00:05:56,356
BECAUSE I'M GONNA TELL THEM

223
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,139
MY KIDS ARE GONNA HAVE

224
00:05:57,139 --> 00:05:58,575
MY LAST NAME.

225
00:05:58,575 --> 00:06:01,186
>> NO, 'CAUSE IT WAS, LIKE,

226
00:06:01,186 --> 00:06:02,013
DEMANDING, AND THAT'S HOW THEY

227
00:06:02,013 --> 00:06:02,579
FEEL, JOSH.

228
00:06:02,579 --> 00:06:03,667
>> I DON'T CARE.

229
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:04,668
>> THAT'S WHY THEY THINK

230
00:06:04,668 --> 00:06:05,452
IT'S DISRESPECTFUL.

231
00:06:05,452 --> 00:06:06,366
>> I DON'T CARE IF IT WAS

232
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,497
DEMANDING OR NOT.

233
00:06:07,497 --> 00:06:09,369
OH, WELL.

234
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:12,110
>> JOSH, I'M 28-WEEKS PREGNANT.

235
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:12,894
>> AND YOU THINK TALKING IS

236
00:06:12,894 --> 00:06:15,549
GONNA MAKE EVERYTHING BETTER?

237
00:06:15,549 --> 00:06:17,115
>> THE PERSON THAT I LOVE

238
00:06:17,115 --> 00:06:20,118
AND MY OWN BLOOD AND FAMILY

239
00:06:20,118 --> 00:06:22,120
THAT I LOVE ARE FIGHTING.

240
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:25,646
LIKE, IT'S NOT THAT GREAT, JOSH.

241
00:06:25,646 --> 00:06:26,560
>> LET'S PUT IT THIS WAY.

242
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:27,430
ME AND THEM AREN'T GONNA GET

243
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:29,606
ALONG.

244
00:06:29,606 --> 00:06:30,390
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE

245
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:34,611
A CHOICE.

246
00:06:34,611 --> 00:06:35,743
>> I CAN'T CHOOSE BETWEEN JOSH

247
00:06:35,743 --> 00:06:37,962
AND MY PARENTS, ESPECIALLY NOW

248
00:06:37,962 --> 00:06:39,529
WHEN I NEED THEM ALL MORE THAN

249
00:06:39,529 --> 00:06:41,618
WHEN I NEED THEM ALL MORE THAN
EVER.

250
00:06:41,618 --> 00:06:49,321
EVER.

251
00:06:49,321 --> 00:06:51,106
>> I HATE THAT JOSH REFUSES

252
00:06:51,106 --> 00:06:52,455
TO SIT DOWN WITH MY PARENTS,

253
00:06:52,455 --> 00:06:53,543
BUT I'M NOT GONNA LET THAT RUIN

254
00:06:53,543 --> 00:06:54,675
THAT LAST TWO WEEKS BEFORE

255
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:56,372
SCHOOL STARTS.

256
00:06:56,372 --> 00:06:58,548
>> I GOT A RIDDLE FOR YOU.

257
00:06:58,548 --> 00:07:00,115
>> I'M READY.

258
00:07:00,115 --> 00:07:03,292
>> "WHY WAS THE DOG SWEATING?"

259
00:07:03,292 --> 00:07:04,075
>> MM?

260
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:05,512
>> 'CAUSE HE HAS TOO MUCH FUR.

261
00:07:05,512 --> 00:07:06,991
[laughs]

262
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:09,777
>> "IT WAS A HOT DOG."

263
00:07:09,777 --> 00:07:11,605
>> OH, GOD, THAT WAS SO EASY.

264
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:12,606
[laughter]

265
00:07:12,606 --> 00:07:14,825
>> I'M READY FOR FALL.

266
00:07:14,825 --> 00:07:16,261
[sighs]

267
00:07:16,261 --> 00:07:18,699
>> TWO WEEKS, SCHOOL STARTS.

268
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:20,483
>> DON'T REMIND ME.

269
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:21,049
>> GETTING UP EARLY IN

270
00:07:21,049 --> 00:07:22,267
THE MORNING.

271
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:23,617
GETTING DRESSED.

272
00:07:23,617 --> 00:07:24,618
>> ARE YOU NERVOUS, JENNIFER,

273
00:07:24,618 --> 00:07:27,490
ABOUT GOING TO A NEW SCHOOL?

274
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,144
>> SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT THERE.

275
00:07:29,144 --> 00:07:30,493
>> UH, THE FACT THAT I'M

276
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:32,147
THE FIRST PREGNANT GIRL

277
00:07:32,147 --> 00:07:33,583
AT THIS SCHOOL...

278
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:34,932
I'LL BE NERVOUS THE NIGHT

279
00:07:34,932 --> 00:07:39,154
BEFORE AND THAT DAY...

280
00:07:39,154 --> 00:07:40,155
THAT WEEK.

281
00:07:40,155 --> 00:07:40,938
[giggles]

282
00:07:40,938 --> 00:07:42,157
EVEN THOUGH IT'S GOING TO BE

283
00:07:42,157 --> 00:07:43,593
HARD TO START A NEW SCHOOL,

284
00:07:43,593 --> 00:07:44,594
THEY'LL LET ME TAKE OFF FOR

285
00:07:44,594 --> 00:07:45,943
A FEW WEEKS TO HAVE THE TWINS

286
00:07:45,943 --> 00:07:47,162
AND BE FLEXIBLE WITH ALL MY

287
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:48,380
DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS I'VE BEEN

288
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,165
HAVING LATELY.

289
00:07:50,165 --> 00:07:52,167
[laughter]

290
00:07:52,167 --> 00:07:53,516
TWINS USUALLY COME EARLY,

291
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:54,735
SO MY DOCTOR IS PLANNING ON

292
00:07:54,735 --> 00:07:56,693
A C-SECTION, SINCE THEY'RE

293
00:07:56,693 --> 00:07:58,478
ALREADY GETTING CROWDED.

294
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,827
>> ALL RIGHT.

295
00:07:59,827 --> 00:08:01,263
OH, YEAH.

296
00:08:01,263 --> 00:08:02,351
ALL RIGHT, SO WE HAVE

297
00:08:02,351 --> 00:08:04,396
THE HEAD RIGHT HERE,

298
00:08:04,396 --> 00:08:05,397
THIS LITTLE CIRCLE,

299
00:08:05,397 --> 00:08:06,529
AND THEN THAT IS THE OTHER

300
00:08:06,529 --> 00:08:07,965
GUY'S STUFF.

301
00:08:07,965 --> 00:08:08,966
[laughter]

302
00:08:08,966 --> 00:08:10,185
HE'S GOT IT RIGHT ON HIS

303
00:08:10,185 --> 00:08:11,229
BROTHER'S HEAD.

304
00:08:11,229 --> 00:08:13,101
[laughter]

305
00:08:13,101 --> 00:08:13,884
HAVE YOU GUYS HAD YOUR

306
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:15,277
BABY SHOWER YET?

307
00:08:15,277 --> 00:08:16,060
>> NO.

308
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,061
>> NO?

309
00:08:17,061 --> 00:08:19,499
>> WE MAY HAVE ONE.

310
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,849
IT DEPENDS.

311
00:08:21,849 --> 00:08:23,503
>> GOT TO HAVE A BABY SHOWER.

312
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,591
TWINS?

313
00:08:24,591 --> 00:08:25,983
THAT'S A LOT OF WORK.

314
00:08:25,983 --> 00:08:27,985
NEED ALL THE HELP YOU CAN GET.

315
00:08:27,985 --> 00:08:28,986
>> WITH ALL THE TENSION AROUND

316
00:08:28,986 --> 00:08:30,771
MY PREGNANCY, NOBODY HAS PLANNED

317
00:08:30,771 --> 00:08:32,207
A BABY SHOWER YET.

318
00:08:32,207 --> 00:08:33,643
JOSH MUST HAVE TOLD HIS PARENTS

319
00:08:33,643 --> 00:08:35,297
HOW DISAPPOINTED I WAS,

320
00:08:35,297 --> 00:08:36,298
BECAUSE THEY OFFERED TO TAKE ME

321
00:08:36,298 --> 00:08:39,083
OUT TO DINNER TO CHEER ME UP.

322
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,302
>> SO HOW ABOUT US THROWING,

323
00:08:40,302 --> 00:08:42,347
YOU KNOW, THE BABY SHOWER?

324
00:08:42,347 --> 00:08:43,218
WOULD Y'ALL LIKE THAT?

325
00:08:43,218 --> 00:08:44,001
>> YEAH.

326
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:44,785
>> OKAY.

327
00:08:44,785 --> 00:08:47,222
>> [laughs]

328
00:08:47,222 --> 00:08:48,440
>> NOW, WHAT IF YOU HAVE THESE

329
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,485
BABIES BEFORE WE'RE ABLE TO HAVE

330
00:08:49,485 --> 00:08:50,617
A BABY SHOWER?

331
00:08:50,617 --> 00:08:52,836
>> I GUESS THEY'LL BE

332
00:08:52,836 --> 00:08:54,359
A SURPRISE GUEST.

333
00:08:54,359 --> 00:08:55,709
[laughter]

334
00:08:55,709 --> 00:08:56,666
>> HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR PARENTS

335
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,233
WOULD FEEL IF THEY WERE INVITED?

336
00:08:58,233 --> 00:09:00,583
>> I THINK MY MOM WOULD

337
00:09:00,583 --> 00:09:01,932
THINK ABOUT GOING.

338
00:09:01,932 --> 00:09:06,415
MY DAD, I THINK HE WOULDN'T.

339
00:09:06,415 --> 00:09:07,416
>> WHAT IS YOUR DAD SO UPSET

340
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:08,199
WITH JOSH ABOUT?

341
00:09:08,199 --> 00:09:09,636
>> 'CAUSE THEY THINK IT'S--

342
00:09:09,636 --> 00:09:10,288
I DON'T KNOW.

343
00:09:10,288 --> 00:09:11,725
THEY THINK, SAYING THE KIDS

344
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:12,943
ARE GONNA HAVE MY LAST NAME,

345
00:09:12,943 --> 00:09:13,727
THEY THINK THAT'S THEIR

346
00:09:13,727 --> 00:09:14,728
DECISION, AND IT'S NOT.

347
00:09:14,728 --> 00:09:15,729
>> THEY SEE IT AS IN

348
00:09:15,729 --> 00:09:19,080
PROTECTING ME FOR THE FUTURE.

349
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,734
I MEAN, I DO UNDERSTAND

350
00:09:20,734 --> 00:09:21,822
WHERE THEY COME FROM,

351
00:09:21,822 --> 00:09:24,912
BUT IT'S MY CHOICE.

352
00:09:24,912 --> 00:09:27,218
BUT IT'S MY CHOICE.
SO...

353
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:30,134
SO...

354
00:09:30,134 --> 00:09:31,919
>> SO I HAVE AN IDEA

355
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,790
FOR THE INVITATIONS.

356
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:34,965
IF WE COULD GET A PICTURE

357
00:09:34,965 --> 00:09:36,271
WHILE YOU'RE STILL PREGNANT,

358
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:36,837
HAVE THAT FOR THE FRONT

359
00:09:36,837 --> 00:09:37,838
OF THE INVITATION.

360
00:09:37,838 --> 00:09:40,014
WHAT DO Y'ALL THINK ABOUT THAT?

361
00:09:40,014 --> 00:09:41,668
NOD ONCE FOR YES

362
00:09:41,668 --> 00:09:42,669
AND TWO FOR NO.

363
00:09:42,669 --> 00:09:45,585
[laughter]

364
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,803
>> IT'S NICE OF JOSH'S MOM

365
00:09:46,803 --> 00:09:48,457
TO PLAN A BABY SHOWER,

366
00:09:48,457 --> 00:09:49,458
BUT I HOPE MY FAMILY

367
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:52,287
IS OKAY WITH IT.

368
00:09:52,287 --> 00:09:53,505
>> SO WE GOT AN INVITATION

369
00:09:53,505 --> 00:09:55,682
FOR THE BABY SHOWER.

370
00:09:55,682 --> 00:09:57,074
>> THEY SAID THEY FELT BAD

371
00:09:57,074 --> 00:09:57,640
BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE

372
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:58,728
A BABY SHOWER.

373
00:09:58,728 --> 00:10:00,774
>> I'D LIKE TO DO SOMETHING

374
00:10:00,774 --> 00:10:03,254
ON THIS SIDE OF THE FAMILY.

375
00:10:03,254 --> 00:10:04,821
>> JOSH HAS TO BE THERE.

376
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:07,998

563
00:15:45,988 --> 00:15:46,946
>> SO YOU GONNA TELL YOUR

564
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,035
PARENTS?

565
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:50,384
>> YES.

566
00:15:50,384 --> 00:15:51,037
>> YOU WANT ME TO GO IN THERE

567
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:52,473
WITH YOU?

568
00:15:52,473 --> 00:15:53,561
>> NO.

569
00:15:53,561 --> 00:15:54,649
STAY IN THE CAR.

570
00:15:54,649 --> 00:15:55,432
>> I'LL GO IN THERE WITH YOU.

571
00:15:55,432 --> 00:15:59,784
>> NOPE, STAY IN THE CAR.

572
00:15:59,784 --> 00:16:01,090
HI!

573
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:03,223
>> HEY.

574
00:16:03,223 --> 00:16:04,659
DID YOU HAVE A NICE EVENING?

575
00:16:04,659 --> 00:16:06,052
>> YES, I DID.

576
00:16:06,052 --> 00:16:10,099
THE FOOD WAS REALLY GOOD.

577
00:16:10,099 --> 00:16:11,753
PERFECT NIGHT.

578
00:16:11,753 --> 00:16:13,494
>> SO DID JOSH LEAVE?

579
00:16:13,494 --> 00:16:16,192
>> NO, HE'S WAITING OUTSIDE.

580
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:17,106
>> OH.

581
00:16:17,106 --> 00:16:19,369
>> HE...

582
00:16:19,369 --> 00:16:25,593
UH, HE PROPOSED TO ME.

583
00:16:25,593 --> 00:16:26,376
MM-HMM.

584
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:28,030
>> OKAY.

585
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:31,033
AND WHAT DID YOU TELL HIM?

586
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:32,600
>> YES.

587
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:33,383
>> [scoffs]

588
00:16:33,383 --> 00:16:36,082
I'M JUST...

589
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:37,083
WHY DON'T YOU TELL HIM

590
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:37,866
TO COME IN AND TALK TO ME

591
00:16:37,866 --> 00:16:40,347
FOR A MINUTE?

592
00:16:40,347 --> 00:16:41,565
>> MM-KAY.

593
00:16:41,565 --> 00:16:43,132
I'LL TEXT HIM.

594
00:16:43,132 --> 00:16:45,004
[buttons clicking]

595
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,005
>> OH, JENNIFER, THAT'S

596
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:50,879
>> OH, JENNIFER, THAT'S
A SPECIAL MOMENT FOR ANY WOMAN.

597
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:53,142
A SPECIAL MOMENT FOR ANY WOMAN.

598
00:16:53,142 --> 00:16:54,883
JOSH, HAVE A SEAT.

599
00:16:54,883 --> 00:16:56,450
PLEASE.

600
00:16:56,450 --> 00:16:57,668
JENNIFER HAS JUST TOLD ME

601
00:16:57,668 --> 00:16:59,279
ABOUT THE NEWS.

602
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,761
I'M SPEECHLESS.

603
00:17:03,761 --> 00:17:05,111
SO WALK ME THROUGH THIS, JOSH.

604
00:17:05,111 --> 00:17:06,329
YOU WALK ME THROUGH THIS,

605
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:08,679
IF YOU CAN, PLEASE.

606
00:17:08,679 --> 00:17:09,898
>> THIS IS JUST THE NEXT STEP

607
00:17:09,898 --> 00:17:11,030
IN OUR RELATIONSHIP.

608
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,075
I MEAN, WE DON'T PLAN ON RUNNING

609
00:17:13,075 --> 00:17:14,555
OFF AND GETTING MARRIED.

610
00:17:14,555 --> 00:17:15,991
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE PLAN ON DOING

611
00:17:15,991 --> 00:17:17,123
AT ALL.

612
00:17:17,123 --> 00:17:19,516
I DID THIS TONIGHT BECAUSE

613
00:17:19,516 --> 00:17:20,735
I TRULY FELT IN MY HEART

614
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:21,953
WE WERE READY FOR IT.

615
00:17:21,953 --> 00:17:24,608
REALLY AND TRULY, I DID.

616
00:17:24,608 --> 00:17:25,609
>> [sighs]

617
00:17:25,609 --> 00:17:27,611
JOSH...

618
00:17:27,611 --> 00:17:28,699
DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO

619
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:30,919
MAKE THIS HAPPEN BECAUSE

620
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:32,399
THE CHILDREN ARE COMING?

621
00:17:32,399 --> 00:17:34,488
>> NO.

622
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:35,489
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE OUTCOME

623
00:17:35,489 --> 00:17:37,230
IS GONNA BE, JOSH.

624
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:40,146
I HAVE TO TELL MY HUSBAND THAT

625
00:17:40,146 --> 00:17:41,060
YOU PROPOSED TO MY DAUGHTER

626
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,323
TONIGHT.

627
00:17:43,323 --> 00:17:44,541
HE'S NOT GONNA TAKE THIS

628
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:47,588
VERY WELL.

629
00:17:47,588 --> 00:17:48,371
THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE

630
00:17:48,371 --> 00:17:49,590
A BEAUTIFUL MOMENT FOR YOU,

631
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:51,244
JENNIFER.

632
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:52,897
>> AND IT WAS.

633
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:56,684
>> AND I'M GLAD IT WAS.

634
00:17:56,684 --> 00:17:59,121
BUT IT'S EVEN MUCH MORE

635
00:17:59,121 --> 00:18:00,340
BEAUTIFUL WHEN YOUR FAMILY

636
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:03,125
ACCEPTS IT, WHEN YOUR FAMILY

637
00:18:03,125 --> 00:18:05,693
CAN SAY CONGRATULATIONS.

638
00:18:05,693 --> 00:18:07,477
BUT I THINK YOU BOTH KNOW

639
00:18:07,477 --> 00:18:10,219
BUT I THINK YOU BOTH KNOW
THAT I CANNOT SAY THAT.

640
00:18:10,219 --> 00:18:24,146
THAT I CANNOT SAY THAT.

641
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:25,278
>> JENNIFER?

642
00:18:25,278 --> 00:18:26,366
>> YES?

643
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:28,368
>> COULD YOU COME HERE, PLEASE?

644
00:18:28,368 --> 00:18:29,369
>> I WAS NOT SURPRISED WHEN

645
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:30,500
I WOKE UP THE NEXT MORNING

646
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,894
AND MY DAD WANTED TO TALK TO ME.

647
00:18:32,894 --> 00:18:34,243
>> I WANT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION

648
00:18:34,243 --> 00:18:40,684
ABOUT SOMETHING THAT JOSH...

649
00:18:40,684 --> 00:18:44,035
PROPOSED TO YOU.

650
00:18:44,035 --> 00:18:45,820
WHY?

651
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:47,778
WHY DID YOU SAY YES?

652
00:18:47,778 --> 00:18:50,781
>> BECAUSE I'M IN LOVE WITH HIM,

653
00:18:50,781 --> 00:18:52,609
AND I WANT TO BE WITH HIM.

654
00:18:52,609 --> 00:18:55,177
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT

655
00:18:55,177 --> 00:18:57,658
YOU'RE ALSO 16 RIGHT NOW TOO.

656
00:18:57,658 --> 00:18:58,441
YOU THINK YOU'RE READY

657
00:18:58,441 --> 00:19:00,530
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THAT?

658
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:02,315
I KNOW YOU'RE PREGNANT,

659
00:19:02,315 --> 00:19:03,403
BUT STILL...

660
00:19:03,403 --> 00:19:04,186
>> WELL, I'M NOT GONNA GO AND

661
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:05,187
JUST RUN OFF AND GET MARRIED.

662
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:06,275
>> NO.

663
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:07,407
WAY, WAY TOO YOUNG.

664
00:19:07,407 --> 00:19:09,409
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING.

665
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:10,279
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT

666
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:11,237
YOU'RE DOING.

667
00:19:11,237 --> 00:19:12,151
YOU'RE HAVING A BABY.

668
00:19:12,151 --> 00:19:13,239
THAT'S FOR SURE.

669
00:19:13,239 --> 00:19:13,804
>> TWO.

670
00:19:13,804 --> 00:19:15,154
>> TWO.

671
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,243
THAT'S ENOUGH TO TAKE ON.

672
00:19:17,243 --> 00:19:19,114
SO LET'S SLOW DOWN,

673
00:19:19,114 --> 00:19:20,550
TAKE YOUR TIME.

674
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:22,596
YOU HAVE THE BABIES.

675
00:19:22,596 --> 00:19:24,815
SEE HOW THAT IMPACTS YOUR LIFE

676
00:19:24,815 --> 00:19:27,035
FIRST.

677
00:19:27,035 --> 00:19:29,255
FAIR ENOUGH?

678
00:19:29,255 --> 00:19:30,038
OKAY?

679
00:19:30,038 --> 00:19:30,734
>> MM-HMM.

680
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:33,302
>> ALL RIGHT.

681
00:19:33,302 --> 00:19:34,651
>> I WISH MY DAD COULD BE HAPPY

682
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:36,653
FOR ME, BUT MAYBE HE'S RIGHT,

683
00:19:36,653 --> 00:19:37,524
THAT WE JUST NEED TO FOCUS

684
00:19:37,524 --> 00:19:41,789
ON THE BABIES.

685
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:43,007
>> HOW DID Y'ALL'S ANNIVERSARY

686
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:44,444
DINNER GO?

687
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:46,359
>> HE PROPOSED TO ME.

688
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:47,577
>> REALLY?

689
00:19:47,577 --> 00:19:48,839
AWW.

690
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:49,623
WHAT DID YOUR PARENTS HAVE

691
00:19:49,623 --> 00:19:51,059
TO SAY ABOUT THAT?

692
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:54,062
>> WELL, MY DAD, HE WAS SAYING

693
00:19:54,062 --> 00:19:55,324
IT'S GOING TOO FAST.

694
00:19:55,324 --> 00:19:57,196
I MEAN, I TOLD HIM, LIKE,

695
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,414
I WASN'T GONNA GO AND GET

696
00:19:58,414 --> 00:20:00,764
MARRIED A YEAR LATER OR NOTHING.

697
00:20:00,764 --> 00:20:01,374
LIKE, WE CAN BE--

698
00:20:01,374 --> 00:20:02,592
>> IT'S JUST THE COMMITMENT.

699
00:20:02,592 --> 00:20:04,464
>> YEAH.

700
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:06,596
I ALSO DIDN'T, LIKE,

701
00:20:06,596 --> 00:20:07,815
WANT TO LEAVE THE HOSPITAL

702
00:20:07,815 --> 00:20:10,252
WITH, LIKE, TWO KIDS AND SAY,

703
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,253
"HE'S MY BOYFRIEND,"

704
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:12,602
OR, "HE'S MY BABY DADDY."

705
00:20:12,602 --> 00:20:14,256
[laughter]

706
00:20:14,256 --> 00:20:15,475
I WANTED TO SAY LIKE,

707
00:20:15,475 --> 00:20:16,737
"NO, HE'S MY FIANCE.

708
00:20:16,737 --> 00:20:18,304
WE'RE GONNA BE TOGETHER.

709
00:20:18,304 --> 00:20:20,741
WE'RE GONNA BE TOGETHER.
WE HAVE A COMMITMENT."

710
00:20:20,741 --> 00:20:22,743
WE HAVE A COMMITMENT."

711
00:20:22,743 --> 00:20:24,962
MY C-SECTION IS PLANNED

712
00:20:24,962 --> 00:20:26,399
FOR NEXT WEEK, AND SINCE

713
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:27,530
I'M EXHAUSTED AND MORE

714
00:20:27,530 --> 00:20:29,010
UNCOMFORTABLE THAN EVER,

715
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,359
I HAVE TO DO ALL MY SCHOOLWORK

716
00:20:30,359 --> 00:20:31,969
FROM HOME.

717
00:20:31,969 --> 00:20:33,188
TIME IS RUNNING OUT,

718
00:20:33,188 --> 00:20:34,189
AND JOSH AND I HAVE BEEN

719
00:20:34,189 --> 00:20:35,321
AVOIDING MAKING A PLAN

720
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:37,453
FOR WHEN WE LEAVE THE HOSPITAL.

721
00:20:37,453 --> 00:20:40,456
DOES IT MATTER IF WE COME HERE

722
00:20:40,456 --> 00:20:42,241
OR TO YOUR HOUSE?

723
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,329
>> IF I'M ALLOWED HERE,

724
00:20:43,329 --> 00:20:44,112
JUST THE FIRST WEEK THEY'RE

725
00:20:44,112 --> 00:20:45,896
ALIVE, I'D LIKE TO BE WITH THEM

726
00:20:45,896 --> 00:20:47,333
THE FIRST WEEK THEY'RE ALIVE,

727
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:49,422
AT LEAST THAT.

728
00:20:49,422 --> 00:20:50,553
>> YOU GUYS GOT TO MAKE THINGS

729
00:20:50,553 --> 00:20:52,642
BETTER, FOR ME AND THE KIDS.

730
00:20:52,642 --> 00:20:53,643
>> DO YOU REALIZE WE'RE NOT

731
00:20:53,643 --> 00:20:55,645
GONNA GET THINGS BETTER?

732
00:20:55,645 --> 00:20:57,430
>> I DON'T KNOW ANYBODY

733
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:59,083
WHO WANTS TO GET MARRIED TO

734
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:01,303
SOMEONE AND NOT BE ON GOOD TERMS

735
00:21:01,303 --> 00:21:02,522
WITH THEIR FAMILY.

736
00:21:02,522 --> 00:21:03,305
>> SO I HAVE TO HAVE

737
00:21:03,305 --> 00:21:04,437
A RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM

738
00:21:04,437 --> 00:21:05,525
TO MARRY YOU?

739
00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:08,528
>> [sighing]

740
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:09,311
>> I JUST WANT TO BE AROUND

741
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:11,095
MY KIDS.

742
00:21:11,095 --> 00:21:13,533
THEY BELONG TO ME, NOT THEM.

743
00:21:13,533 --> 00:21:14,316
>> IF YOU GUYS DON'T WORK

744
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:15,317
THINGS OUT, JOSH, NO ONE

745
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:19,365
IS GOING TO LET YOU BE AROUND.

746
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:21,715
>> SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

747
00:21:21,715 --> 00:21:23,282
>> IF JOSH'S ATTITUDE DOESN'T

748
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,718
CHANGE BY THE TIME THE BABIES

749
00:21:24,718 --> 00:21:26,154
ARE BORN, THEN I'M AFRAID MY

YOU SIT THERE, AND YOU ARGUE

948
00:27:22,118 --> 00:27:23,685

THE HOSPITAL, AND I WANT

958
00:27:57,414 --> 00:27:58,981

THE WAY JOSH ACTED LAST NIGHT,

960
00:28:00,983 --> 00:28:02,419
I'M NOT EVEN SURE IF MY PARENTS

961
00:28:02,419 --> 00:28:05,771

966
00:28:11,254 --> 00:28:12,255
FOR ME.

967
00:28:12,255 --> 00:28:15,258
>> WHY SHOULD I OPEN MY DOORS

968
00:28:15,258 --> 00:28:17,652
TO HIM, WELCOME HIM IN?

969
00:28:17,652 --> 00:28:19,698

00:28:51,642 --> 00:28:52,992
SO WE'RE GOING HOME

990
00:28:52,992 --> 00:28:54,776
AS A FAMILY TODAY, OKAY?

OH, NO, NO.

00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:14,840
SLOW DOWN.

1001
00:29:14,840 --> 00:29:15,797
>> I'M SORRY.

1002
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:17,886
>> I'M SORRY.
I'M TRYING.

1003
00:29:17,886 --> 00:29:22,935
I'M TRYING.

1004

>> HOW ABOUT SOME BREAD?

1037
00:30:16,423 --> 00:30:17,206
I DIDN'T GIVE YOU BREAD.

UNCOMFORTABLE.

1046
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:31,960
WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT LETTING

1047

ANY RESPECT FOR ME AND JENNIFER,

1067
00:31:14,002 --> 00:31:15,438
THEY WOULD HAVE KEPT EVERYBODY

1068
00:31:15,438 --> 00:31:16,918
AWAY FOR A LITTLE BIT.

1069
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:17,701
BUT I DON'T LIKE LIVING WITH
