TAKE IT TO--I TAKE IT TO

190
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,434
A CERTAIN EXTENT.

191
00:04:26,434 --> 00:04:27,601
I'LL GO TO PARTIES AND STUFF,

192
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:29,102
BUT I WON'T DRINK.

193
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:30,203
>> MOST GIRLS WOULD JUST, LIKE,

194
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:31,204
GO OUT AND BE LIKE, "HEY, MOM,

195
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:32,340
YOU WANT TO WATCH MY KID?"

196
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,006
>> YEAH.

197
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:34,041
>> BUT YOU'RE GONNA STAY HOME

198
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:34,942
WITH YOUR KID AND, LIKE,

199
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:35,909
TAKE CARE OF HIM AND STUFF.

200
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:36,944
>> I'LL WATCH A MOVIE WITH HIM

201
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:39,279
OTHER THAN JUST GO OUT.

202
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,280
>> I CANNOT WAIT TILL SHE HAS

203
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:40,948
THIS BABY.

204
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,049
>> AND YOU KNOW WHAT'S SO GREAT

205
00:04:42,049 --> 00:04:42,683
ABOUT ME?

206
00:04:42,683 --> 00:04:43,651
I FEEL LIKE I'M GOING TO BE

207
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:44,318
A GOOD MOM.

208
00:04:44,318 --> 00:04:45,218
ONCE HE GETS OLD ENOUGH,

209
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,153
I'LL DEFINITELY BRING HIM

210
00:04:46,153 --> 00:04:46,854
TO THE BEACH.

211
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:48,121
HE'S GONNA HAVE SO MUCH FUN.

212
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,056
ALL RIGHT, YOU READY?

213
00:04:49,056 --> 00:04:52,660
>> YEAH.

214
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,761
>> I CAN SPEND THE WHOLE DAY

215
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:54,995
AT THE BEACH, BUT I STILL

216
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,364
HAVEN'T TOLD MY MOM ANDREW'S

217
00:04:56,364 --> 00:04:57,531
ON HIS WAY OVER.

218
00:04:57,531 --> 00:05:00,468
SO I BETTER TELL HER.

219
00:05:00,468 --> 00:05:02,102
>> THIS IS HOW IT IS.

220
00:05:02,102 --> 00:05:03,671
I MAKE THE RULES.

221
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:05,005
WHEN ANDREW COMES HERE,

222
00:05:05,005 --> 00:05:07,140
I NEED TO TALK TO HIS MOTHER

223
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,142
AND SAY, "LOOK, YOU KNOW,

224
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,079
HE MAY COME, BUT HE MUST LEAVE

225
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,381
AT THIS TIME."

226
00:05:13,381 --> 00:05:15,549
IT'S NOT NO FIVE-DAY HOLIDAY

227
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:16,384
HOTEL HERE.

228
00:05:16,384 --> 00:05:18,118
>> OKAY.

229
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,219
>> BECAUSE YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

230
00:05:19,219 --> 00:05:20,320
YOU DON'T PAY RENT.

231
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,822
>> YOU ALWAYS OVEREXAGGERATE.

232
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,557
YOU TALK ABOUT HOW MUCH FOOD

233
00:05:23,557 --> 00:05:25,393
ANDREW EATS FROM US WHEN HE'S

234
00:05:25,393 --> 00:05:27,728
HERE, HOW MUCH HE [bleep] USES

235
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:29,730
THE SHOWER WHEN HE'S HERE.

236
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,899
>> IF HE CAN PULL UP AND START,

237

00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:36,069
WITH THINGS FOR THIS BABY,

239
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,739
THEN MAYBE THINGS COULD CHANGE.

240
00:05:44,445 --> 00:05:45,413
>> WELL, WHAT DOES HE THINK?

241
00:05:45,413 --> 00:05:46,447
THIS BABY--HE'S NOT GONNA COME

242
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:47,180

YOU KNOW, I DON'T HAVE TO LIKE

246
00:05:51,051 --> 00:05:52,920
ANDREW, BUT IF HE, YOU KNOW,

247
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,755
SHOWED YOU MORE SUPPORT...

248
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:55,756
>> WELL, GUESS WHAT, MOM.

249
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:57,024
NEWS FLASH:

250
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:58,125
JUST 'CAUSE HE CAN'T SUPPORT ME

251
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,027
FINANCIALLY, HE COULD SUPPORT ME

252
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:01,061
MENTALLY, MOM.

253
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:01,829
>> DO YOU KNOW--

254
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:02,796
>> IT'S WHO I'M HAPPY WITH,

255
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:03,697
AND I'M HAPPY WITH HIM.

MENTALLY ISN'T GONNA

259
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,034

>> WELL, IT DOESN'T MATTER

261

NO MATTER WHAT YOU GUYS SAY,

267
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:14,942
IF YOU GET ME PISSED OFF,

268
00:06:14,942 --> 00:06:16,109
I'LL GET MORE PISSED OFF,

269
00:06:16,109 --> 00:06:17,745
AND SOONER OR LATER, I'LL JUST

270
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:19,246
LEAVE, AND I'LL LEAVE WITH HIM,

271
00:06:19,246 --> 00:06:20,414
NEVER COME BACK.

272
00:06:20,414 --> 00:06:21,314
>> WELL, I DON'T WANT--

273
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:22,416
>> SO EITHER YOU ACCEPT HIM NOW,

274
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,417
OR LATER IN THE LONG RUN,

275
00:06:23,417 --> 00:06:25,919
YOU'RE GONNA REGRET IT.

276
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:26,954
[chime dings]

277
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:28,321
ANDREW'S A PART OF MY FAMILY

278
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:29,657
NOW, AND MY MOM'S GONNA

279
00:06:29,657 --> 00:06:31,158
HAVE TO GET USED TO IT,

280
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:33,494
WHETHER SHE LIKES IT OR NOT.

281
00:06:41,168 --> 00:06:42,470
>> I GOT MY MOM TO AGREE

282
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,304
TO LET ANDREW VISIT, BUT HE

283
00:06:44,304 --> 00:06:46,306
KNOWS HE'S NOT EXACTLY WELCOME

284
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:47,475
AT MY HOUSE.

285
00:06:47,475 --> 00:06:49,610
SO ANDREW MADE SURE TO ARRIVE

286
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,612
WHEN MY MOM WAS AWAY AT WORK.

287
00:06:51,612 --> 00:06:52,613

WERE YOU ON BIRTH CONTROL,

OR DID YOU NOT USE A CONDOM?

333

>> WELL, ME AND ANDREW,

334
00:08:01,515 --> 00:08:02,516
WE GOT IN AN ARGUMENT, SO WE

00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:03,483
STOPPED TALKING FOR A COUPLE

336
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:05,719
DAYS, SO WHEN WE STOPPED

337

TALKING, I STOPPED TAKING

338
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,889
BIRTH CONTROL, AND THEN, YOU

339
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:10,257
KNOW, OF COURSE, WE GOT BACK

340
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:11,759
TOGETHER, AND WE DIDN'T USE

341
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:12,893

ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU LEARNED

348

ON BIRTH CONTROL, AND I DIDN'T

354
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,343
GET PREGNANT, SO I THOUGHT,

355
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:32,045
YOU KNOW, WHY WOULD IT CHANGE

356
00:08:32,045 --> 00:08:33,547
NOW, THAT I WOULD JUST SUDDENLY

357
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:34,347
GET PREGNANT?

358
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,182

00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:42,455
BEING UNEMPLOYED HAS REALLY PUT

363
00:08:42,455 --> 00:08:44,457
A STRAIN ON OUR RELATIONSHIP,

364
00:08:44,457 --> 00:08:45,659
SO WE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW

365
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:47,595
WE'RE GONNA MAKE THIS WORK.

366
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:48,562

>> SHE SITS HERE, AND SHE

372
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:53,934
COMPLAINS THAT I CAN'T SUPPORT

373
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:54,602
THE CHILD.

374
00:08:54,602 --> 00:08:55,535
>> YEAH, BUT CAN YOU SEE

375
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,436
WHERE SHE'S COMING FROM?

376
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:57,337
>> HONEY, I EVEN WENT TO

377
00:08:57,337 --> 00:08:58,205
MCDONALD'S, AND I WAS

378
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,506
OVERQUALIFIED.

379
00:08:59,506 --> 00:09:01,942
THAT'S KIND OF SAD, HONEY.

380
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:03,176
I MEAN, THERE'S NO JOBS.

381
00:09:03,176 --> 00:09:04,411
THAT'S THE ONLY THING, YOU KNOW?

382
00:09:04,411 --> 00:09:05,378
THE ECONOMY SUCKS RIGHT NOW

383
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:06,346
FROM THE DEPRESSION.

384
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,014
>> YEAH.

385
00:09:07,014 --> 00:09:07,981
>> YOU KNOW, SHE NEEDS TO

386
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:08,949
UNDERSTAND, LOOK, MY LIFE

387
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:09,983
WAS STRAIGHT.

388
00:09:09,983 --> 00:09:10,784
I DID HAVE A CAR.

389
00:09:10,784 --> 00:09:11,752
SHE THINKS THAT I LIVED WITH

390
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:13,053
MY PARENTS ALL MY LIFE, BUT,

391
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,021
YOU KNOW, HERE'S THE THING,

392
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:14,622
THOUGH.

393
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:15,689
I'M GONNA BE HONEST WITH YOU.

394
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:16,724
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU AND I AREN'T

395
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:18,191
GOING TO, YOU KNOW, LIKE,

396
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:19,526
SPLIT UP ANY TIME SOON.

397
00:09:19,526 --> 00:09:20,661
WE'RE NEVER GONNA SPLIT UP,

398
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:21,328
YOU KNOW?

399
00:09:21,328 --> 00:09:22,295
AFTER YOU GET FINISHED WITH

400
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,296
SCHOOL AND YOU TURN 18,

401
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:24,197
WE'RE GONNA GET MARRIED

402
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:25,298
OR SOMETHING.

403
00:09:25,298 --> 00:09:27,635
EVERYTHING'S GONNA WORK OUT.

404
00:09:27,635 --> 00:09:29,102
>> I HOPE IT DOES.

405
00:09:29,102 --> 00:09:30,403
I WOULD REALLY LIKE YOU TO BE

406
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:31,672
HERE WHEN, LIKE...

407
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:32,940
>> NO, I'M NOT GONNA BE HERE--

408
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,274
>> WHEN MY WATER BREAKS, THOUGH.

409
00:09:34,274 --> 00:09:37,177
>> I MEAN, THE THING IS--

410
00:09:37,177 --> 00:09:38,511
>> I'LL CONVINCE MY MOM.

411
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:39,379
>> HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY.

412
00:09:39,379 --> 00:09:40,147
>> I'LL DO THAT.

413
00:09:40,147 --> 00:09:40,914
>> YEAH, RIGHT.

414
00:09:40,914 --> 00:09:42,249
>> BUT CONVINCING MY MOM

415
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,517
IS MUCH EASIER SAID THAN DONE.

416
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:45,853
I WISH YOU'D JUST GIVE HIM

417
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:47,354
A CHANCE.

418
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,522
>> WHAT'S HIS PLAN NOW?

419
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:50,423
WHAT'S HE GONNA DO WHEN

420
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:52,325
HE HAS TO PAY CHILD SUPPORT?

421
00:09:52,325 --> 00:09:53,026
I WISH THAT--

422
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,061
>> YEAH, YOU CAN'T STAND HIM.

423
00:09:54,061 --> 00:09:55,028
I KNOW WHAT YOU WERE ABOUT

424
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:55,629
TO SAY.

425
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:56,429
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

426
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:57,464
IF HE HAD A JOB AND WAS TRYING

427
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:58,699
TO MAKE MORE OF AN EFFORT TO

428
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:02,035
STAND BEHIND YOU AND THIS BABY,

429
00:10:02,035 --> 00:10:04,371
THEN IT WOULD BE--

430
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:06,006
I'D BE OKAY WITH IT.

431
00:10:06,006 --> 00:10:07,675
>> HE WANTS TO GET MARRIED.

432
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:08,341
BUT--

433
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,042
>> OH, MY GOD.

434
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:09,777
DON'T DO THAT.

435
00:10:09,777 --> 00:10:10,778
>> HERE, PUT THOSE IN THERE.

436
00:10:10,778 --> 00:10:11,478
>> ALL RIGHT.

437
00:10:11,478 --> 00:10:13,380
YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT.

438
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,748
THAT WOULD BE THE WORST MISTAKE,

439
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:17,150
TO DO THAT, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

440
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,151
YOU DON'T WANT TO--YOU'RE NOT

441
00:10:18,151 --> 00:10:18,952
DOING THAT, RIGHT?

442
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,020
>> I NEED TO GET A NAPKIN.

443
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:23,523
>> OKAY, ALL RIGHT.

444
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:25,192
>> OBVIOUSLY, MY MOM IS NEVER

445
00:10:25,192 --> 00:10:28,195
GONNA ACCEPT ANDREW.

446
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:32,966
>> THERE YOU GO.

447
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:34,401
>> THE WEEKEND FLEW BY,

448
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:35,402
AND ANDREW'S DAD IS HERE

449
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:36,904
TO PICK HIM UP.

450
00:10:36,904 --> 00:10:38,071
[car horn beeps]

451
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:38,906
IS THAT MY DAD?

452
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:40,440
>> YEP, HE'S WAITING OUTSIDE.

453
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,174
>> ALL RIGHT.

454
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:42,009
LET'S GO.

455
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:42,976
>> ANDREW MANAGED TO AVOID

456
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:44,845
MY MOM THE WHOLE TIME HE'S BEEN

457
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:46,847
HERE, BUT NOW SHE HAS SOMETHING

458
00:10:46,847 --> 00:10:47,715
TO SAY.

459
00:10:47,715 --> 00:10:49,216
>> BARNEY, BARNEY.

460
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:51,618
THIS ISN'T THE HOLIDAY HOTEL.

461
00:10:51,618 --> 00:10:52,953
IT'S OUR HOUSE, AND HE NEEDS

462
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:55,055
TO RESPECT MY RULES.

463
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:55,923
ANDREW, I'VE KNOWN YOU

464
00:10:55,923 --> 00:10:56,824
FOR QUITE A WHILE.

465
00:10:56,824 --> 00:10:58,058
>> YEAH, I'VE KNOWN YOU TOO.

466
00:10:58,058 --> 00:10:59,026
>> SINCE JENELLE'S BEEN WITH

467
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:01,428
YOU, THERE'S BEEN MAJOR,

468
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:03,630
MAJOR TROUBLE, AND NOW YOU

469
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,965
GOT HER PREGNANT.

470
00:11:04,965 --> 00:11:06,633
YOU SAY A LOT OF LIES.

471
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:08,301
A LOT OF DRAMA'S BEEN GOING ON

472
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:09,870
SINCE YOU TWO MET.

473
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,705
THIS IS MY CHILD HERE

474
00:11:11,705 --> 00:11:12,973
AND MY GRANDCHILD.

475
00:11:12,973 --> 00:11:14,541
THINGS HAVE GOT TO CHANGE.

476
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,943
YOU GOT TO STEP UP MORE.

477
00:11:15,943 --> 00:11:17,244
>> YEAH, YOU NEED TO MAN UP,

478
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:19,379
START BEING MORE RESPONSIBLE.

479
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:20,513
>> I LOOKED FOR A JOB, MAN.

480
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,448
>> BUT, ANDREW, SHE'S BEEN

481
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:22,482
PREGNANT EIGHT MONTHS, AND YOU

482
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:23,550
COULD HAVE GOT A JOB ANYWHERE,

483
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,718
AT MCDONALD'S.

484
00:11:24,718 --> 00:11:25,819
>> I WAS EVEN OVERQUALIFIED

485
00:11:25,819 --> 00:11:26,754
FOR MCDONALD'S.

486
00:11:26,754 --> 00:11:27,620
MY DAD WAS THERE.

487
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,056
>> EVERYTHING THE BABY HAS

488
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:30,390
IS FROM ME.

489
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,558
ALL THE EXPENSE HAS BEEN

490
00:11:31,558 --> 00:11:32,960
ON MY SHOULDERS.

491
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,626
>> WHAT?

492
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:34,594
DO YOU HAVE TO BE A [bleep]

493
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:35,562
MILLIONAIRE JUST TO [bleep]

494
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:36,596
CALM DOWN AND MAKE HER [bleep]

495
00:11:36,596 --> 00:11:37,230
BE HAPPY?

496
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,031
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

497
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,699
I DON'T APPRECIATE YOU,

498
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,802
YOU KNOW, IN MY 16-YEAR-OLD

499
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:44,137
DAUGHTER'S BED HAVING SEX

500
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:44,872
IN MY HOUSE...

501
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:45,572
>> MOM, MOM.

502
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:46,539
>> WHETHER SHE'S KNOCKED UP

503
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:47,207
OR NOT.

504
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:47,941
>> GUESS WHAT.

505
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:48,976
NOTHING ELSE WORSE CAN HAPPEN,

506
00:11:48,976 --> 00:11:52,012
MOM.

507
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,322
>> ANDREW'S VISIT MADE IT CLEAR

508
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:04,157
HE HAS NO PLANS TO MOVE CLOSER

509
00:12:04,157 --> 00:12:05,325
OR GET A JOB.

510
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:07,527
MAYBE MY MOM WAS RIGHT.

511
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:08,962
IF I HAD A BABY LATER ON

512
00:12:08,962 --> 00:12:10,330
IN LIFE, I WOULD HAVE MORE

513
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,032
MONEY, AND I CAN EVEN BUY

514
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:14,134
STUFF TODAY IF I WANTED TO.

515
00:12:14,134 --> 00:12:15,102
>> DID YOU THINK THAT IT WAS

516
00:12:15,102 --> 00:12:15,903
GONNA BE DIFFERENT?

517
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:16,837
LIKE, YOU AND ANDREW WERE

518
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:17,704
GOING TO BE DIFFERENT?

519
00:12:17,704 --> 00:12:18,705
>> I THOUGHT ANDREW WAS GONNA

520
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:20,140
LIVE DOWN HERE WITH ME.

521
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,008
I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA

522
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:21,674
HAVE A JOB.

523
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:22,542
I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA

524
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:23,443
SUPPORT ME AND THE BABY.

525
00:12:23,443 --> 00:12:24,477
I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA MOVE--

526
00:12:24,477 --> 00:12:25,779
BE MOVED OUT BY NOW AND HAVE

527
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:26,479
A CAR.

528
00:12:26,479 --> 00:12:27,147
>> YEAH.

529
00:12:27,147 --> 00:12:28,048
>> THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT

530
00:12:28,048 --> 00:12:28,849
WAS GONNA HAPPEN,

531
00:12:28,849 --> 00:12:30,583
BUT NONE OF IT EVER HAPPENED.

532
00:12:30,583 --> 00:12:32,920
>> YEAH.

533
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,454
>> ANDREW REALLY NEEDS TO START

534
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:35,622
GROWING UP AND GETTING IT

535
00:12:35,622 --> 00:12:37,124
TOGETHER, 'CAUSE THIS BABY

536
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:39,793
IS COMING SOON.

537
00:12:44,264 --> 00:12:45,165
>> THESE LITTLE BUBBLES,

538
00:12:45,165 --> 00:12:46,666
THAT'S ALL THE UMBILICAL CORD.

539
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,268
THERE'S A LITTLE HAND.

540
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,402
THERE'S A LITTLE FOOT.

541
00:12:49,402 --> 00:12:50,904
>> OH, YEAH.

542
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:52,105
>> ALL RIGHT, MISS JENELLE,

543
00:12:52,105 --> 00:12:53,606
WE'RE GONNA TALK TO YOU ABOUT

544
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,442
SOME SIGNS OF LABOR THAT YOU

545
00:12:55,442 --> 00:12:56,877
NEED TO LOOK OUT FOR, OKAY?

546
00:12:56,877 --> 00:12:58,912
CONTRACTIONS, ANY BRIGHT RED

547
00:12:58,912 --> 00:13:00,547
VAGINAL BLEEDING, ANYTHING LIKE

548
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:02,649
THAT, YOU NEED TO GO STRAIGHT

549
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:04,084
TO THE HOSPITAL,

550
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:05,919
BECAUSE PRETTY MUCH AT NEXT

551
00:13:05,919 --> 00:13:07,921
WEEK, 38 WEEKS, YOU KNOW,

552
00:13:07,921 --> 00:13:09,089
YOU CAN REALLY GO INTO LABOR

553
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:10,157
ANYTIME.

554
00:13:10,157 --> 00:13:10,991
WHY DON'T YOU SIT UP

555
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:11,992
SO YOU CAN GET OFF YOUR BACK?

556
00:13:11,992 --> 00:13:12,692
>> ALL RIGHT.

557
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,161
>> THERE WE GO.

558
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:15,528
SO IS THE BABY'S DADDY BEING

559
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:16,830
SUPPORTIVE?

560
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,332
>> NOT REALLY, BECAUSE I THOUGHT

561

00:22:54,474 --> 00:22:55,341
I'M SORRY, BUT DAMN IT

934
00:22:55,341 --> 00:22:57,944
IF I CAN'T LOVE HIM.

935
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,214
>> I REALLY DO WANT

936
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:04,050
TO BELIEVE HIM.

937
00:23:08,721 --> 00:23:10,222
>> THE NEXT DAY, ANDREW WAITED

938
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:12,058
FOR MY MOM TO LEAVE, AND THEN

939
00:23:12,058 --> 00:23:13,726
HE SAID HIS GOOD-BYES.

940
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,261
IT REALLY SUCKS HE LIVES

941
00:23:15,261 --> 00:23:16,596
FOUR HOURS AWAY.

942
00:23:16,596 --> 00:23:18,264
>> HONEY, I REALLY DO GOT TO GO.

943
00:23:18,264 --> 00:23:19,065
IT'S GETTING LATE.

944
00:23:19,065 --> 00:23:20,500
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE, THOUGH.

945
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,534
BUT THEN AGAIN, I'LL SEE YOU

946
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:22,368

OKAY?

953
00:23:32,979 --> 00:23:34,614
I'LL CALL YOU.

954
00:23:34,614 --> 00:23:35,281
ALL RIGHT.

955
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:35,948

>> ALL RIGHT, LOVE YOU.

957
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:37,950
BYE-BYE, LITTLE ONE.

958
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:38,718
>> COME ON, JACE,

959
00:23:38,718 --> 00:23:41,120
YOU HANDSOME LITTLE BOY.

960
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,255
JACE, YOU READY TO ROLL?

961
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,123
>> BEFORE I KNEW IT,

962
00:23:44,123 --> 00:23:45,658
IT WAS TIME TO TAKE JACE HOME

963
00:23:45,658 --> 00:23:49,095
AND TRY TO DO THIS FOR REAL.

964
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:50,096
>> WHERE IS THIS GOING TO?

965
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:51,230
>> RIGHT THERE.

966

>> IT'LL TIGHTEN UP WHEN THEY--

967
00:23:53,566 --> 00:23:56,435
IT WON'T GO ANYWHERE.

968
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:00,907
>> EVEN THOUGH ANDREW IS NOT

969
00:24:00,907 --> 00:24:03,275
BY MY SIDE, I HAVE MY MOM,

AND HE LIKES IT HERE.

977
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:12,685
YOU DON'T KNOW.

978
00:24:12,685 --> 00:24:15,387
>> HE'S LIKE, "PAPA, SAY HELLO."

979

[Jace gurgles]

980
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:18,224
>> [laughs]

981
00:24:18,224 --> 00:24:19,458
I THINK YOU'RE POOPING.

[Jace cries]

984
00:24:23,696 --> 00:24:25,331
>> MY FIRST WEEK HOME WITH JACE

985
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:26,365
IS A LOT HARDER THAN I THOUGHT

986
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:27,567
IT WOULD BE.

987
00:24:27,567 --> 00:24:28,635
WHAT DO YOU KEEP KICKING ME FOR?

988
00:24:28,635 --> 00:24:29,969
I HAVE NO TIME TO MYSELF,

989
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,971
AND ANDREW HASN'T CALLED ONCE,

990
00:24:31,971 --> 00:24:33,405
MUCH LESS MADE A PLAN TO COME

991
00:24:33,405 --> 00:24:34,073
VISIT.

992
00:24:34,073 --> 00:24:34,974
AH.

[Jace fussing]

998
00:24:42,949 --> 00:24:44,751
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

999
00:24:44,751 --> 00:24:45,618
>> THINGS ARE GETTING

1000
00:24:45,618 --> 00:24:46,753
EVEN HARDER.

1001
00:24:46,753 --> 00:24:48,087
JACE ISN'T SLEEPING AT NIGHT,

1002
00:24:48,087 --> 00:24:50,189
AND NEITHER IS ANYONE ELSE.

1003
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:51,157
>> YOU HAVE TO MAKE BOTTLES.

1004
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:52,224
>> SO MY MOM IS STARTING TO TAKE

1005
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:53,826
THE LEAD, SINCE WATCHING JACE

1006
00:24:53,826 --> 00:24:55,494
IS JUST TOO MUCH FOR ME.

1007
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,328
[Jace cries]

1008
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:59,766
>> THE BABY NEEDS A BOTTLE.

1009
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:02,869
YOU GONNA TAKE HIM?

1010
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:04,370
>> I NEVER THOUGHT I CAN GO

1011
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,939
THIS LONG WITHOUT SLEEP.

1012
00:25:10,076 --> 00:25:10,943
ISN'T THE BABY GOING TO

1013
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:13,279
DAY CARE WHILE I GO TO SCHOOL?

1014
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,314
>> HE STARTS THIS COMING WEEK.

1015
00:25:15,314 --> 00:25:17,316
>> I CAN'T WAIT FOR THAT.

1016
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:20,553
>> IT'S WEEK THREE, AND

1017
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:22,589
I FINALLY HEARD FROM ANDREW.

1018
00:25:22,589 --> 00:25:24,591
BUT WHAT HE HAD TO SAY MADE ME

1019
00:25:24,591 --> 00:25:26,225
EVEN MORE ANGRY.

1020
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:28,661
LAST NIGHT, I GOT A CALL FROM

1021
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:30,997
ANDREW SAYING THAT HE WENT TO

1022
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:34,000
JAIL FOR A D.U.I. CHARGE.

1023
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:34,867
>> I'M NOT SURPRISED.

1024
00:25:34,867 --> 00:25:35,835
I'M NOT SURPRISED.

1025
00:25:35,835 --> 00:25:36,836
YOU CAN'T BE WITH THIS GUY

1026
00:25:36,836 --> 00:25:38,537
WHO'S A DRINKER.

1027
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,538
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT, RIGHT?

1028
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,239
>> YEAH, MOM.

1029
00:25:40,239 --> 00:25:41,540
>> AND YOU KNOW, HE HASN'T DONE

1030
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,709
ANYTHING FOR THE BABY,

1031
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:45,177
AND I DON'T THINK HE'S CAPABLE.

1032
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:46,679
AND I THINK THAT YOU BETTER

1033
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:48,047
START, YOU KNOW, PUTTING HIM

1034
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,983

NOT, LIKE I TOLD YOU, I SAID,

TO JUST THINK OF YOURSELF NOW

1039
00:25:58,224 --> 00:25:59,058
AND THE BABY.

1040
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,059
I JUST DON'T THINK HE'S

1041
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,894
THE PERSON FOR YOU.

I DON'T WANT HIM DOWN HERE.

1046
00:26:07,667 --> 00:26:08,668

1047
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:09,902
TIME AGO TO MAKE A LIST.

NOW ADD CALLING DRUNK

1057
00:26:23,983 --> 00:26:25,985
THE DAY HE GOT OUT OF JAIL.

1058
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:30,489
IT'S A NO-BRAINER.

1299
00:32:19,005 --> 00:32:19,905
>> CAN YOU--

1300
00:32:19,905 --> 00:32:21,473
>> YOU'RE NOT HERE, JENELLE.

1301
00:32:21,473 --> 00:32:22,541
DO YOU GET UP IN THE MORNING

1302
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:23,542
AND TAKE CARE OF THE BABY...

1303
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:24,510
>> MOM, WELL, GUESS WHAT.

1304
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:25,377
>> AND GET HIM DRESSED

1305
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:26,245
AND MAKE HIS BOTTLES?

1306
00:32:26,245 --> 00:32:27,113
>> GUESS WHAT.

1307
00:32:27,113 --> 00:32:27,779
>> WHAT?

1308
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:28,580
NO, YOU'RE NOT HERE

1309
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,315
HALF THE TIME.

1310
00:32:29,315 --> 00:32:30,282
>> CAN YOU LISTEN TO ME?

1311
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:31,150
IF YOU DON'T SHUT UP,

1312
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:32,051
I'M GOING TO WALK AWAY.

1313
00:32:32,051 --> 00:32:32,985
>> I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE

1314
00:32:32,985 --> 00:32:34,453
GONNA BE TAKING OFF IN THE

1315
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:35,787
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT AND NOT

1316
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:36,822
COMING BACK.

1317
00:32:36,822 --> 00:32:37,789
>> MOM, DO YOU REALLY THINK

1318
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:38,824
I WOULD TAKE OFF IN THE MIDDLE

1319
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:39,758
OF THE NIGHT AND LEAVE HIM

1320
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:40,426
IN THE BED?

1321
00:32:40,426 --> 00:32:41,627
>> YEAH.

1322
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:42,561
>> WHATEVER, MOM.

1323
00:32:42,561 --> 00:32:43,662
>> YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TAKING CARE

1324
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:45,164
OF THIS BABY SINCE IT'S BORN.

1325
00:32:45,164 --> 00:32:46,332
[bleep]DAMN IT, STAY HOME

1326
00:32:46,332 --> 00:32:48,200
AND TAKE CARE OF THE KID.

1327
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,435
YOU FEEL LIKE THIS BABY IS

1328
00:32:49,435 --> 00:32:51,037
LIKE A DOG OR A CAT

1329
00:32:51,037 --> 00:32:52,104
THAT LAYS ON THE COUCH.

1330
00:32:52,104 --> 00:32:52,904
"OH, I'M LEAVING."

1331
00:32:52,904 --> 00:32:53,739
>> AND YOU KNOW WHAT

1332
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:54,440
I FEEL LIKE?

1333
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,241
>> "I'M LEAVING."

1334
00:32:55,241 --> 00:32:56,108
>> AND YOU KNOW WHAT--

1335
00:32:56,108 --> 00:32:56,842
AND YOU KNOW--

1336
00:32:56,842 --> 00:32:57,709
>> "I'M GOING WITH ALL

1337
00:32:57,709 --> 00:32:58,410
THESE BOYS."

1338
00:32:58,410 --> 00:32:59,411
>> CAN YOU SHUT UP AND LISTEN?

1339
00:32:59,411 --> 00:33:00,312
>> "I'M GOING PARTYING."

1340
00:33:00,312 --> 00:33:01,313
>> YOU KNOW WHAT I FEEL LIKE?

1341
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:02,181
I DON'T EVEN FEEL LIKE

1342
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:03,049
YOU'RE MY MOM NO MORE.

1343
00:33:03,049 --> 00:33:04,116
AND I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO FOLLOW

1344
00:33:04,116 --> 00:33:05,117
ALL THESE RULES JUST TO LIVE

1345
00:33:05,117 --> 00:33:05,851
IN YOUR HOUSE.

1346
00:33:05,851 --> 00:33:06,618
WELL, GUESS WHAT.

1347
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:07,886
WHEN I'M 18, I'M OUT.

1348
00:33:07,886 --> 00:33:08,620
>> YOU'RE OUT.

1349
00:33:08,620 --> 00:33:09,755
>> AND WHEN JACE COMES WITH ME,

1350
00:33:09,755 --> 00:33:10,722
YOU WILL NEVER SEE ME OR HIM

1351
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:12,191
AGAIN.

1352
00:33:12,191 --> 00:33:13,525
>> THIS IS MY GRANDSON,

1353
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:15,861
AND IT'LL BE A COLD DAY IN HELL

1354
00:33:15,861 --> 00:33:18,030
BEFORE YOU WALK AWAY AND NOT

1355
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:19,031
HAVE SOMEBODY TAKE CARE OF

1356
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:20,599
THIS BABY PROPERLY.

1357
00:33:20,599 --> 00:33:21,467
DO THE RIGHT THING FOR

1358
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:22,601
THIS BABY.

1359
00:33:22,601 --> 00:33:23,535
>> DON'T EVEN TALK TO ME.

1360
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:24,370
I DON'T EVEN WANT--

1361
00:33:24,370 --> 00:33:25,271
JUST GET OUT OF MY FACE.

1362
00:33:25,271 --> 00:33:25,937
I DON'T--

1363
00:33:25,937 --> 00:33:26,938
>> WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

1364
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,040
>> I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO YOU.

1365
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,309
GET THE [bleep] OUT OF MY FACE.

1366
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:31,643
>> I HAVE NOTHING MORE TO SAY

1367
00:33:31,643 --> 00:33:32,378
TO YOU.

1368
00:33:32,378 --> 00:33:33,679
I'M WAITING FOR YOU TO TURN 18.

1369
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:34,580
YOU'RE OUT OF MY HOUSE.

1370
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,247
>> YEP.

1371
00:33:35,247 --> 00:33:36,115
>> YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW

1372
00:33:36,115 --> 00:33:37,249
WHAT I GO THROUGH.

1373
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:38,517
I'M SO STRESSED OUT.

1374
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:39,485
>> YEAH, AND YOU THINK THAT

1375
00:33:39,485 --> 00:33:40,286
I'M NOT GONNA HAVE

1376
00:33:40,286 --> 00:33:41,120
A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.

1377
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,020
>> YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT?

1378
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,588
I AM.

1379
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:43,322
YOU KNOW WHAT?

1380
00:33:43,322 --> 00:33:44,256
I GOT THIS LITTLE [bleep]

1381
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:45,257
OF A DAUGHTER, YOU, WHO TAKES

1382
00:33:45,257 --> 00:33:46,492
OFF ALL THE TIME, AND I GOT

1383
00:33:46,492 --> 00:33:48,727
A GRANDSON BABY WHO I'M TAKING

1384
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:49,695
CARE OF AND WORKING

1385
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:52,030
A 40-HOUR JOB.

1386
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:53,765
AND YOU, AND ALL YOU DO IS PARTY

1387
00:33:53,765 --> 00:33:54,633
YOUR ASS AROUND TOWN.

1388
00:33:54,633 --> 00:33:55,601
>> I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

1389
00:33:55,601 --> 00:33:58,937
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

1390
00:33:58,937 --> 00:34:00,272
AFTER OUR BIG FIGHT,

1391
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:01,640
LAUREN AND AMBER STOPPED BY.

1392
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,808
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN GOING OUT

1393
00:34:02,808 --> 00:34:04,176
SO MUCH WITH MY OTHER FRIENDS,

1394
00:34:04,176 --> 00:34:05,444
I HADN'T SEEN MUCH OF THEM

1395
00:34:05,444 --> 00:34:06,278
LATELY.

1396
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:07,113
>> JENELLE.

1397
00:34:07,113 --> 00:34:08,380
>> I JUST HIT HER IN THE FACE

1398
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,581
WITH THE UMBRELLA.

1399
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:11,250
>> WITH THE UMBRELLA?

1400
00:34:11,250 --> 00:34:12,118
OKAY, LET ME SHOW YOU

1401
00:34:12,118 --> 00:34:13,452
THE BABY'S ROOM.

1402
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:14,886
I'M HAPPY YOU GUYS STOPPED BY,

1403
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:15,854
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN

1404
00:34:15,854 --> 00:34:16,688
YOU GUYS IN A WHILE.

1405
00:34:16,688 --> 00:34:17,423
>> OH, MY GOD.

1406
00:34:17,423 --> 00:34:18,490
I CAN'T WAIT TILL JACE

1407
00:34:18,490 --> 00:34:20,459
GETS OLD ENOUGH TO SAY "MOMMY."

1408
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:21,227
>> I KNOW.

1409
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:22,961
MY MOM GOES, "NO, HE'LL SAY

1410
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:23,962
MAY-MAY FIRST, BECAUSE YOU'RE

1411
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:25,030
NEVER AROUND."

1412
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,832
>> MAY-MAY.

1413
00:34:26,832 --> 00:34:28,300
>> IS IT GETTING MORE EASIER FOR

1414
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,302
YOU TO TAKE CARE OF HIM OR...

1415
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:32,037
>> I LOVE TAKING CARE OF HIM.

1416
00:34:32,037 --> 00:34:33,038
LIKE, IT MIGHT NOT SEEM LIKE

1417
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:35,040
I'M HERE A LOT, BUT I DO LOVE

1418
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:35,874
TAKING CARE OF HIM.

1419
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:37,176
AND I MEAN, I JUST MAKE TIME

1420
00:34:37,176 --> 00:34:38,244
FOR MYSELF.

1421
00:34:38,244 --> 00:34:39,278
AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING,

1422
00:34:39,278 --> 00:34:40,179
MAKING TIME FOR MYSELF.

1423
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:41,147
I MEAN, I MIGHT HAVE MADE--

1424
00:34:41,147 --> 00:34:42,214
>> BUT A LITTLE TOO MUCH TIME.

1425
00:34:42,214 --> 00:34:43,582
>> I KNOW, A LITTLE TOO MUCH.

1426
00:34:43,582 --> 00:34:44,750
MY MOM GOES, "OH, WELL, LAUREN

1427
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:45,851
AND AMBER THINK THAT YOU'RE NOT

1428
00:34:45,851 --> 00:34:47,085
DOING GOOD AT ALL, AND THEY

1429
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,154
THINK THAT YOU SHOULD STRAIGHTEN

1430
00:34:48,154 --> 00:34:49,288
YOURSELF UP AND DA-DA, DA-DA."

1431
00:34:49,288 --> 00:34:50,156
>> I MEAN, I DO THINK

1432
00:34:50,156 --> 00:34:51,089
YOU SHOULD STRAIGHTEN UP.

1433
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:51,823
>> YEAH, I DO.

1434
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:52,824
>> I SAID--HONESTLY, I SAID,

1435
00:34:52,824 --> 00:34:53,792
"I HAVE NOT TALKED TO THEM

1436
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:54,493
FOR A WHILE.

1437
00:34:54,493 --> 00:34:55,361
THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT'S

1438
00:34:55,361 --> 00:34:56,328
GOING ON."

1439
00:34:56,328 --> 00:34:57,496
>> [sighs]

1440
00:34:57,496 --> 00:34:59,498
WE THINK THAT, YOU KNOW,

1441
00:34:59,498 --> 00:35:00,599
YOU WERE JUST GOING OUT,

1442
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:02,168
PARTY, PARTY, PARTY.

1443
00:35:02,168 --> 00:35:03,169
PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTY HAVE

1444
00:35:03,169 --> 00:35:04,303
TOLD US, BECAUSE EVERYBODY'S

1445
00:35:04,303 --> 00:35:05,337
SAYING, "OH, WELL, SHE'S

1446
00:35:05,337 --> 00:35:07,005
A [bleep] MOM, AND SHE DOESN'T

1447
00:35:07,005 --> 00:35:08,807
DO THIS FOR HER KID."

1448
00:35:08,807 --> 00:35:09,975
I THINK YOU NEED TO PROVE IT

1449
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:11,410
TO THEM THAT YOU ARE A GOOD MOM

1450
00:35:11,410 --> 00:35:12,411
AND THAT YOU CAN DO IT

1451
00:35:12,411 --> 00:35:14,146
AND NOT JUST THAT YOU'RE NOT

1452
00:35:14,146 --> 00:35:15,447
A PARTY-PARTY GIRL.

1453
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:17,783
DON'T GO OUT AS MUCH AS YOU'VE

1454
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:19,218
BEEN DOING OR STAY GONE JUST

1455
00:35:19,218 --> 00:35:20,386
BECAUSE YOU AND YOUR MOM GET

1456
00:35:20,386 --> 00:35:21,220
IN AN ARGUMENT.

1457
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:22,288
LIKE, COME HOME AND PROVE TO HER

1458
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:23,555
THAT, "MOM, I WANT TO BE HERE

1459
00:35:23,555 --> 00:35:24,556
FOR JACE."

1460
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:25,524
>> MM-HMM.

1461
00:35:25,524 --> 00:35:26,525
>> PEOPLE REALLY NEED TO KNOW

1462
00:35:26,525 --> 00:35:28,394
THAT YOU REALLY ARE TRYING.

1463
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:31,062
>> YEAH.

1464
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:35,301
[chime dings]

1465
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:37,135
>> MY FRIENDS MAY HAVE A POINT,

1466
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,670
BUT THEY JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND

1467
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:40,839
HOW HARD THIS IS FOR ME.

1468
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,715
>> I'VE STAYED HOME THE PAST

1469
00:35:49,715 --> 00:35:51,583
COUPLE OF NIGHTS, SO MY MOM AND

1470
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:53,319
I ARE GETTING ALONG BETTER.

1471
00:35:53,319 --> 00:35:53,985
>> GOT HIM?

1472
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:54,820
>> YEAH, I GOT HIM.

1473
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:57,055
COOL--OW, OW, OW.

1474
00:35:57,055 --> 00:35:59,124
[groans]

1475
00:35:59,124 --> 00:36:00,626
DOES THIS COME OFF YOU, JACE?

1476
00:36:00,626 --> 00:36:02,127
OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS,

1477
00:36:02,127 --> 00:36:03,462
IT STARTED TO BECOME CLEAR

1478
00:36:03,462 --> 00:36:05,964
HOW BIG THIS RESPONSIBILITY IS.

1479
