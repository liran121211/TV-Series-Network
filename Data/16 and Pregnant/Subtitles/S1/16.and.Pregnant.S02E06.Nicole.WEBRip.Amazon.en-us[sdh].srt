1
00:00:05,074 --> 00:00:06,592
 My name is Nicole.

2
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:09,009
 I'm 16 years old, and I'm 
from Longwood, Florida.

3
00:00:09,147 --> 00:00:12,322
 I've got a ton of friends, 
and my house is definitely

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,634
 the place to come hang.

5
00:00:13,772 --> 00:00:15,084
We're going to prank call.

6
00:00:15,222 --> 00:00:17,051
Oh, no.
[laughing]

7
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:18,846
 My dad died when I was two.

8
00:00:18,984 --> 00:00:22,367
 So my mom raised me on her own, 
and it was just the two of us.

9
00:00:22,505 --> 00:00:24,748
 Until Tyler showed up.

10
00:00:25,197 --> 00:00:28,476
 He's almost 16, and he's 
the love of my life.

11
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:30,858
 He and my mom get to 
hang out a lot

12
00:00:30,996 --> 00:00:32,411
 because he 
dropped out of school.

13
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:33,999
All right, all right.

14
00:00:34,137 --> 00:00:36,001
 There's friction between Tyler 
and his parents

15
00:00:36,139 --> 00:00:37,106
 so his grandma took him in.

16
00:00:37,244 --> 00:00:38,866
And Grandma wins.

17
00:00:39,004 --> 00:00:40,212
[laughing]

18
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:42,559
-Phoebe, do you want corn?
-Yeah.

19
00:00:42,697 --> 00:00:44,251
 Tyler grew up 
with a single mom,

20
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:47,254
 so he filled in as daddy 
for his two little sisters.

21
00:00:48,082 --> 00:00:49,911
 It's just 
his nature to be nurturing.

22
00:00:50,119 --> 00:00:52,052
Just be safe,
if you need me, call me.

23
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:54,882
 All Tyler's experience 
with kids will come in handy

24
00:00:55,089 --> 00:00:57,919
 because... I'm pregnant.

25
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,956
[rock music]

26
00:01:01,164 --> 00:01:02,890
[music playing]

27
00:01:06,618 --> 00:01:08,654
OK, what happened in school
today, you guys?

28
00:01:08,792 --> 00:01:11,071
It's really boring,
I miss seeing you.

29
00:01:11,209 --> 00:01:12,727
 My sophomore year is on hold

30
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:14,384
 until after the baby comes.

31
00:01:14,522 --> 00:01:16,697
 So I don't see my friends 
as often as I used to.

32
00:01:16,835 --> 00:01:18,526
So when did you find out
you were, like, pregnant?

33
00:01:18,664 --> 00:01:20,459
Like, did you just
take tests, or--

34
00:01:20,597 --> 00:01:21,874
I took seven.

35
00:01:22,012 --> 00:01:23,221
ALLIE: Seven?

36
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:24,946
You weren't sure the
first three worked?

37
00:01:25,602 --> 00:01:26,569
I peed on a stick.

38
00:01:26,707 --> 00:01:27,811
And then I gave it to--

39
00:01:27,949 --> 00:01:29,503
[laughing]

40
00:01:29,641 --> 00:01:31,056
I gave it to my mom because I
was too nervous to look at it.

41
00:01:32,506 --> 00:01:33,783
Were you on birth control?

42
00:01:34,508 --> 00:01:35,647
ALLIE: Oh.

43
00:01:35,785 --> 00:01:37,683
-You weren't using condoms?
-Nope.

44
00:01:37,821 --> 00:01:39,927
-Oh.
-Yeah.

45
00:01:40,065 --> 00:01:41,791
ALLIE: Well, that's
what happens.

46
00:01:41,929 --> 00:01:42,723
Oh, yeah.

47
00:01:42,861 --> 00:01:44,034
It's just, like, unreal.

48
00:01:44,173 --> 00:01:46,244
It should feel
unreal for you, too.

49
00:01:46,382 --> 00:01:47,693
Aren't you nervous?

50
00:01:47,831 --> 00:01:49,488
I was freaking out
because the first thing

51
00:01:49,626 --> 00:01:50,593
that popped in my
head was Tyler,

52
00:01:50,731 --> 00:01:52,077
what is he going to think?

53
00:01:52,215 --> 00:01:53,596
As soon as I told him,
I thought he was going

54
00:01:53,734 --> 00:01:55,632
to walk out, and just leave.

55
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:56,875
But he didn't.

56
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,637
]NICOLE] In fact, Tyler is more 
committed than ever.

57
00:02:00,775 --> 00:02:03,088
-Come on, Macy.
-Go and say hi to mommy.

58
00:02:03,985 --> 00:02:06,678
Mm, I want a kiss from you,
not the dog.

59
00:02:06,816 --> 00:02:08,093
[blowing air on belly]

60
00:02:08,231 --> 00:02:09,853
 He wants 
to be an example to our baby

61
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:11,959
 and get back to school 
before she arrives.

62
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,341
The baby will be
born in January,

63
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,790
and then I go back in March.

64
00:02:15,928 --> 00:02:18,414
-Do you miss it?
-Yeah.

65
00:02:18,552 --> 00:02:19,622
I miss my friends.

66
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,899
I miss going to school, too.

67
00:02:21,037 --> 00:02:23,039
-I feel you.
-Do you? Really?

68
00:02:23,177 --> 00:02:24,799
I don't want to
just be nothing.

69
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:26,801
I want Brooklyn to
have a good life.

70
00:02:27,802 --> 00:02:28,976
 We're having a girl,

71
00:02:29,114 --> 00:02:30,460
 and we're naming her Brooklyn.

72
00:02:30,598 --> 00:02:31,703
She's moving.

73
00:02:31,841 --> 00:02:33,843
Oh, I felt it.

74
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:39,469
 As a kid, Tyler was shuttled

75
00:02:39,607 --> 00:02:41,678
 back and forth between 
his mom and dad's house.

76
00:02:42,127 --> 00:02:45,855
 He started failing school 
and got expelled when he was 13.

77
00:02:45,993 --> 00:02:47,650
 I know he'll go back someday.

78
00:02:48,098 --> 00:02:50,860
 But for now, we've got a 
ton of time to hang out.

79
00:02:51,274 --> 00:02:53,000
Baby, do you remember
the first time we met?

80
00:02:53,414 --> 00:02:54,726
Do you?

81
00:02:54,864 --> 00:02:56,728
Yeah, it took me all
night to ask you out.

82
00:02:56,866 --> 00:02:58,178
I was so nervous.

83
00:02:58,316 --> 00:03:01,042
And I was like, oh, my God.
He is cute!

84
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,699
I can't help it.

85
00:03:03,769 --> 00:03:05,012
What made you like me?

86
00:03:05,392 --> 00:03:07,946
Well, your personality
when I got around you

87
00:03:08,084 --> 00:03:09,327
because I was the only one

88
00:03:09,465 --> 00:03:10,845
that could break you
out of your shell.

89
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:13,503
Yeah, my mom
couldn't even do that.

90
00:03:13,641 --> 00:03:16,230
Yeah, and just your smile.

91
00:03:16,851 --> 00:03:18,750
And the way you love me.

92
00:03:19,682 --> 00:03:21,062
What made you like me?

93
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:22,374
Everything.

94
00:03:22,512 --> 00:03:24,169
Give me some details.

95
00:03:24,307 --> 00:03:25,653
Your personality.

96
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,483
Well, of course.

97
00:03:27,621 --> 00:03:29,692
-Your looks.
- I know.

98
00:03:30,486 --> 00:03:35,076
The way you treat me,
the way you protect me.

99
00:03:38,528 --> 00:03:40,772
[laughing]

100
00:03:43,568 --> 00:03:46,398
-You're going to kill yourself.
-Nah.

101
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:50,126
Awesome.

102
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:51,886
 There's 
a lot to love about Tyler,

103
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:53,543
 but he does have a nasty habit.

104
00:03:53,923 --> 00:03:57,133
 He promised to quit smoking 
once Brooklyn comes.

105
00:03:58,583 --> 00:04:01,241
 He's also going to 
have to get a job.

106
00:04:02,794 --> 00:04:04,830
 Tyler definitely has skills.

107
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:07,074
 He wants to grow up 
and be a chef.

108
00:04:07,454 --> 00:04:10,595
 He also thinks he can get work 
as a mixed martial arts fighter

109
00:04:11,216 --> 00:04:14,357
 and has plans to tour 
as a professional skateboarder.

110
00:04:14,737 --> 00:04:16,290
[music playing]

111
00:04:19,362 --> 00:04:21,226
 But for now, all I know is

112
00:04:21,364 --> 00:04:24,298
 we're going to have to get 
some help from our families.

113
00:04:25,161 --> 00:04:28,475
So you're getting two
pancakes, sausage,

114
00:04:28,613 --> 00:04:31,098
scrambled eggs with American
cheese and onions,

115
00:04:31,236 --> 00:04:32,582
and a side of hash browns.

116
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,722
-And then a biscuit, please.
-And a biscuit.

117
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:35,965
She's eating for two.

118
00:04:36,103 --> 00:04:37,380
She got a little
baby in the belly.

119
00:04:37,518 --> 00:04:38,830
She doesn't stop eating.
You ought to see her.

120
00:04:38,968 --> 00:04:39,865
WAITRESS: No?
-Oh, my God.

121
00:04:40,003 --> 00:04:41,039
 I'm lucky my mom

122
00:04:41,177 --> 00:04:43,144
 loves Tyler as much as I do.

123
00:04:43,835 --> 00:04:46,493
 And she definitely didn't react 
like the average mom

124
00:04:46,631 --> 00:04:48,357
 when she found out 
I was pregnant.

125
00:04:48,495 --> 00:04:50,151
What did you think
when you first found out?

126
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:51,567
The first thing that
came in your head.

127
00:04:51,705 --> 00:04:53,120
To be honest with you,
I was happy for you.

128
00:04:53,258 --> 00:04:55,709
But I was scared for you

129
00:04:55,847 --> 00:04:57,262
because I know
it's going to be hard for you.

130
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,815
He's got to get a job someday.

131
00:04:58,953 --> 00:05:00,265
You've got to find something.

132
00:05:00,403 --> 00:05:02,957
I could be a mechanic,
I could be a landscaper.

133
00:05:03,095 --> 00:05:05,615
-I could do all sorts of stuff.
-A professional skateboarder.

134
00:05:05,753 --> 00:05:07,065
[TINA] Seriously--

135
00:05:07,203 --> 00:05:08,515
I want you to teach
Brooklyn how to skate.

136
00:05:08,653 --> 00:05:09,964
You don't realize how
hard it's going to be.

137
00:05:10,102 --> 00:05:11,414
You think it's going to be easy.

138
00:05:11,552 --> 00:05:13,382
You think it's going
to be a piece of cake.

139
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,762
Ever--

140
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:16,212
Here's your drinks
to go and I'll be back.

141
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,938
Oh, let's see what
we're paying today.

142
00:05:19,974 --> 00:05:22,011
-Geez.
-What?

143
00:05:22,667 --> 00:05:24,807
It's expensive, this is the most
I've ever spent here.

144
00:05:24,945 --> 00:05:26,256
That you spent?

145
00:05:26,395 --> 00:05:28,328
Well, no, uh, that
we've ever spent here.

146
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:30,088
You got to start
saving some money

147
00:05:30,226 --> 00:05:31,986
because you're not going
to get much out of me.

148
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:34,057
I just want to be
able to support them.

149
00:05:34,437 --> 00:05:36,059
I'm ready for Brooklyn.
I can't wait.

150
00:05:36,197 --> 00:05:37,060
And yours was
the most expensive.

151
00:05:37,198 --> 00:05:39,131
Really?

152
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,168
I've got to get
this checked out.

153
00:05:41,306 --> 00:05:42,411
Can I ask a question?

154
00:05:42,549 --> 00:05:44,240
Am I, like, reading this wrong?

155
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:45,690
It doesn't make sense.

156
00:05:45,828 --> 00:05:48,727
This adds up to $30 with
the $6 and the two 10?

157
00:05:48,865 --> 00:05:49,935
What's that?

158
00:05:50,073 --> 00:05:51,040
It looks like you
charged me twice.

159
00:05:51,178 --> 00:05:52,490
WAITRESS: Ma'am, it's right.

160
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:53,939
Is that--

161
00:05:54,077 --> 00:05:56,183
That's your sausage, hash
browns, scrambled eggs.

162
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:57,667
Oh, that's my mine.

163
00:05:57,805 --> 00:05:59,980
-You mean-- but what's that?
-That was her--

164
00:06:00,118 --> 00:06:01,188
Oh, that's hers?

165
00:06:01,637 --> 00:06:03,293
 Everybody keeps telling us

166
00:06:03,432 --> 00:06:04,743
 that love 
doesn't pay the bills.

167
00:06:05,088 --> 00:06:08,609
 We know that's true, 
'cause my mom does, for now.

168
00:06:08,989 --> 00:06:11,543
 She's even managed to scrape 
together enough

169
00:06:11,681 --> 00:06:13,718
 to buy Tyler 
a cake for his 16th birthday.

170
00:06:14,097 --> 00:06:17,066
 The boys have gathered at 
our house to celebrate.

171
00:06:17,204 --> 00:06:18,550
Tyler.

172
00:06:18,688 --> 00:06:20,103
 Of course, 
Tyler hasn't woken up yet.

173
00:06:20,483 --> 00:06:22,174
 What do you want to do 
for your birthday today?

174
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,349
-Any ideas?
-I'm not getting up.

175
00:06:25,074 --> 00:06:26,455
Get up, boy.

176
00:06:27,663 --> 00:06:29,492
Come on, you're 16,
we've got to do something.

177
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,045
What did we
do for your birthday?

178
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,668
-Nothing.
-Nothing.

179
00:06:32,806 --> 00:06:34,221
Well, you're pregnant,
you got a baby, that's enough.

180
00:06:34,359 --> 00:06:36,396
That's for him.
That's not from you.

181
00:06:36,534 --> 00:06:38,052
I haven't had
a birthday party in years.

182
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:40,054
TINA: I couldn't afford
anything, Nicole, you know that.

183
00:06:40,434 --> 00:06:41,539
Let's go to the
skate park today.

184
00:06:41,677 --> 00:06:43,403
-Do you guys want to go?
-Sure.

185
00:06:43,748 --> 00:06:45,370
[music playing]

186
00:06:49,512 --> 00:06:50,927
I got him a cake.

187
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,791
Do you think he's
going to like it?

188
00:06:52,929 --> 00:06:53,999
Yeah.

189
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,658
Happy birthday, Tyler,
happy birthday to you.

190
00:06:57,796 --> 00:07:00,385
He might be 16, but he acts
like he's five sometimes.

191
00:07:00,523 --> 00:07:02,560
-Always.
-Age is just a number.

192
00:07:03,043 --> 00:07:05,355
Are we still going to come
here when Brooklyn's born?

193
00:07:05,494 --> 00:07:06,564
Yeah, he's going to
teach her to skate.

194
00:07:06,702 --> 00:07:08,807
 A lot of people don't understand

195
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:12,673
 why my mom is so unconditionally 
supportive of me and Tyler.

196
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:15,573
What's wrong?

197
00:07:16,021 --> 00:07:17,747
It's all right to be
nervous and everything.

198
00:07:17,885 --> 00:07:18,886
I was, with you.

199
00:07:19,024 --> 00:07:20,405
Extremely.

200
00:07:20,543 --> 00:07:21,924
 When I was 10 months old,

201
00:07:22,062 --> 00:07:24,202
 my mom gave birth 
to a baby who died.

202
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,274
 And I think that makes her 
more open to my being pregnant.

203
00:07:27,412 --> 00:07:30,450
Emily was born prematurely.

204
00:07:31,174 --> 00:07:33,383
She lived, like, three hours.

205
00:07:33,729 --> 00:07:35,765
Your father was
crying and crying,

206
00:07:35,903 --> 00:07:37,664
and he fell to the floor,
he passed out.

207
00:07:37,802 --> 00:07:39,976
I didn't--I never
told you that.

208
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,221
She died in my arms,
on my birthday.

209
00:07:43,739 --> 00:07:45,913
And then your dad turns
around and dies on my birthday

210
00:07:46,051 --> 00:07:49,469
in '95, a year to the day
that Emily was born.

211
00:07:53,714 --> 00:07:56,441
I definitely want
to take a picture

212
00:07:56,579 --> 00:07:58,961
so he can be there
for her birth.

213
00:07:59,617 --> 00:08:02,827
He's going to be
a grandpa, you know?

214
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:07,832
He really--I think he'd
be there for you, too.

215
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:09,937
You know that,
he'd really support you.

216
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,527
You know?

217
00:08:14,045 --> 00:08:16,116
And--and I know he'd love
the hell out of Tyler.

218
00:08:21,155 --> 00:08:22,743
Sorry.

219
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,438
I just wish he was here
to see all of this,

220
00:08:28,577 --> 00:08:29,888
to be a part of it.

221
00:08:30,026 --> 00:08:31,718
[sniffing]

222
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,527
 Our baby's due 
in two months.

223
00:08:47,665 --> 00:08:49,839
I just can't wait for
her to get here, man.

224
00:08:49,977 --> 00:08:52,083
 And Tyler's still 
looking for work.

225
00:08:52,221 --> 00:08:53,567
I applied for them, too.

226
00:08:53,705 --> 00:08:55,189
-Did you?
-Yeah, online.

227
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,537
But they don't pay you [bleep].
It's $6.50 an hour.

228
00:08:57,675 --> 00:08:58,986
Still, it's money.

229
00:08:59,124 --> 00:09:01,299
 People 
say Tyler lacks motivation.

230
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:05,475
 But I have no doubt about 
his ability to be a good dad.

231
00:09:05,614 --> 00:09:07,892
You guys ready to eat?
Here, baby girl.

232
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:09,721
 All I have 
to do is watch the way

233
00:09:09,859 --> 00:09:11,689
 he takes care 
of his two little sisters.

234
00:09:11,827 --> 00:09:13,414
Let me put some
butter in here for you.

235
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:15,002
Are you excited for the baby?

236
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:16,521
-Yeah.
-You are?

237
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:18,005
So you guys ready to be an aunt?

238
00:09:18,143 --> 00:09:20,318
-Nah.
-Why?

239
00:09:22,838 --> 00:09:25,219
-That's not true.
-No, that's not true.

240
00:09:25,357 --> 00:09:26,980
I'm not going to love
the baby more than you.

241
00:09:27,118 --> 00:09:28,982
I'm just going to
love it just as much.

242
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:32,261
Oh!

243
00:09:33,158 --> 00:09:34,988
What are you going to do when
you see that baby

244
00:09:35,126 --> 00:09:36,230
for the first time?

245
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:37,507
I'm going to
pinch it's cheeks.

246
00:09:37,646 --> 00:09:39,026
I'm going to go like this.

247
00:09:39,302 --> 00:09:40,580
[laughing]

248
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:44,100
So is mommy happy
that I'm having a baby?

249
00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:45,999
-Tell the truth.
-No.

250
00:09:46,137 --> 00:09:47,725
-No?
-No.

251
00:09:47,863 --> 00:09:49,243
-What she say?
-No, she's mad.

252
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:50,279
She said you're too--

253
00:09:50,417 --> 00:09:52,592
you're a big baby.

254
00:09:53,523 --> 00:09:54,870
What else did she say?

255
00:09:55,008 --> 00:09:55,767
Nana!

256
00:09:56,181 --> 00:09:57,942
Go ahead, tell us,
we want to here.

257
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,391
Nah.

258
00:09:59,702 --> 00:10:01,324
-Oh, come on.
-Come on!

259
00:10:01,462 --> 00:10:02,602
She says you should get a job.

260
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,775
I'm just telling you.

261
00:10:03,913 --> 00:10:05,432
Mommy was
pissed, wasn't she?

262
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:07,192
Oh, she still is.

263
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:09,712
Just give her time to get used
to it, and she'll come around.

264
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:11,680
It's not really the point
of getting used to it.

265
00:10:11,818 --> 00:10:14,027
The thing is,
this was their choice

266
00:10:14,165 --> 00:10:15,994
and we have to deal with it, no
matter whether we agree with it

267
00:10:16,132 --> 00:10:17,409
-or not.
-Yeah.

268
00:10:17,547 --> 00:10:20,481
And I couldn't imagine
never supporting a child.

269
00:10:20,861 --> 00:10:23,312
 Tyler's lucky 
his grandma has his back.

270
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:24,727
[NELL] Touch the belly there.

271
00:10:24,865 --> 00:10:26,867
 He left 
his mom's house two years ago.

272
00:10:27,005 --> 00:10:28,800
 And he had nowhere else to turn.

273
00:10:28,938 --> 00:10:30,388
Put the shirt down.

274
00:10:30,526 --> 00:10:32,252
What was one of the reasons
you came to stay here?

275
00:10:32,390 --> 00:10:33,563
I don't want to talk about it.

276
00:10:33,702 --> 00:10:36,187
I can't stand it
when you guys fight.

277
00:10:37,533 --> 00:10:38,741
God, my hair was
about to start falling out

278
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:40,156
when I was living there.

279
00:10:41,571 --> 00:10:42,711
 Tyler's mom had him

280
00:10:42,849 --> 00:10:44,367
 when she had just turned 17.

281
00:10:44,885 --> 00:10:46,991
 When Tyler's little 
sisters came,

282
00:10:47,129 --> 00:10:48,786
 and his mom's 
marriage fell apart,

283
00:10:48,924 --> 00:10:51,064
 she couldn't handle 
Tyler on her own.

284
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:54,826
 Deep down, I know he hurts 
about his family situation.

285
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:58,312
 But now he gets to start 
a brand new one with me.

286
00:10:59,728 --> 00:11:01,177
[guitar music]

287
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:09,013
 Tomorrow's my baby shower.

288
00:11:09,151 --> 00:11:12,257
 So my girls are coming to sleep 
over and start the party early.

289
00:11:12,395 --> 00:11:14,950
-Prank call Tyler.
-Prank call Tyler, Kayla.

290
00:11:16,814 --> 00:11:18,643
-It'd be funny.
-What do I say?

291
00:11:18,781 --> 00:11:20,300
Act like a guy.

292
00:11:20,438 --> 00:11:21,819
Tell him you want to fight
him and he'll get fired up.

293
00:11:21,957 --> 00:11:23,096
-Oh, yeah.
-Just do it, do it, do it.

294
00:11:23,234 --> 00:11:24,684
[phone ringing]

295
00:11:26,893 --> 00:11:27,928
[TYLER] Hello?

296
00:11:28,066 --> 00:11:29,309
Hey, is this Tyler?

297
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:32,692
This is Oscar.

298
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:33,831
[TYLER] i

299
00:11:33,969 --> 00:11:35,418
Yeah, this is Oscar.

300
00:11:35,556 --> 00:11:38,042
Yeah, I heard you wanted
to take it down, man.

301
00:11:39,664 --> 00:11:41,355
I heard
you wanted to beat it.

302
00:11:41,493 --> 00:11:42,840
[laughing]

303
00:11:44,842 --> 00:11:45,774
Yeah.

304
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:48,811
All right,
I'll be there in 15 minutes.

305
00:11:49,432 --> 00:11:50,399
Bye.

306
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:52,332
[laughing]

307
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:54,955
You got him into it!

308
00:11:56,129 --> 00:11:58,648
You can go on the internet
and prank call prostitutes.

309
00:11:58,787 --> 00:11:59,822
[laughing]

310
00:12:00,478 --> 00:12:03,584
My name is Harmony and I'm 23
years old, give me a call.

311
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,931
-All right.
-Call.

313
00:12:06,795 --> 00:12:08,037
[HARMONY] Hello?

314
00:12:08,175 --> 00:12:10,177
Hi, yes, for my
boyfriend's birthday,

315
00:12:10,315 --> 00:12:12,041
I'm very interested
about getting him a girl.

316
00:12:12,179 --> 00:12:13,733
Can you help me out?

317
00:12:16,321 --> 00:12:18,530
OK, well, he's very
into the Spider-Man.

318
00:12:18,668 --> 00:12:22,120
So what if I can get you,
but dressed up as like a guy?

319
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,571
HARMONY [ON PHONE]: OK.

320
00:12:24,709 --> 00:12:25,814
[laughing]

321
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,920
 I started getting 
sharp pains in my stomach

322
00:12:29,058 --> 00:12:30,473
 And at seven months pregnant,

323
00:12:30,611 --> 00:12:32,959
 I don't think 
I should be feeling this.

324
00:12:40,173 --> 00:12:42,106
I have to go to
the bathroom, so--

325
00:12:46,075 --> 00:12:47,352
Is she OK?

326
00:12:47,974 --> 00:12:49,354

[TINA] 
Babe, are you OK?

328
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:53,393
Mom, I got
really bad cramps.

329
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:55,464
It's right under my belly.

330
00:12:55,671 --> 00:12:57,155
It really hurts, really bad.

331
00:12:57,535 --> 00:12:58,881
[music playing]

332
00:13:02,643 --> 00:13:04,300
I'm going to the hospital.

333
00:13:04,438 --> 00:13:07,752
Tyler's grandma and my mom want
to take me to get checked out.

334
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:09,547
Oh, my gosh.

335
00:13:10,099 --> 00:13:11,860
[music playing]

336
00:13:15,553 --> 00:13:17,313
All right?
All right, let's go.

337
00:13:17,451 --> 00:13:18,556
Get in the truck.

338
00:13:18,694 --> 00:13:20,420
Nicole, what's going on?

339
00:13:22,249 --> 00:13:24,700
They hurt,
now it's like really bad.

340
00:13:24,838 --> 00:13:26,115
Be careful!

341
00:13:26,909 --> 00:13:27,979
Call me.

342
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:30,879
TINA: OK.

343
00:13:32,018 --> 00:13:34,123
[music playing]

344
00:13:39,577 --> 00:13:41,717
 Canceling 
my sleepover was a bummer,

345
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:43,512
 but at seven months pregnant,

346
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:46,549
 I'm way more worried about 
the pains in my lower belly.

347
00:13:47,033 --> 00:13:48,551
[pensive music]

348
00:13:53,487 --> 00:13:56,111
 After four hours 
in the hospital,

00:13:56,249 --> 00:13:57,664
 the doctors had 
to give me a shot

350
00:13:57,802 --> 00:13:59,942
 to keep me 
from going into preterm labor.

351
00:14:02,013 --> 00:14:05,258
 At least I got released in time 
to get over to my baby shower.

352
00:14:05,637 --> 00:14:07,363
[upbeat music]

353
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,572
[cheering and applause]

354
00:14:12,644 --> 00:14:13,887
I want a hug.

355
00:14:14,336 --> 00:14:16,407
 My mom was able 
to set up the party

356
00:14:16,545 --> 00:14:18,305
 at her friend's 
retirement complex.

357
00:14:19,237 --> 00:14:20,963
Hey, it's a girl baby.

358
00:14:21,722 --> 00:14:22,862
Isn't that cool?

359
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,173
So heavy!

360
00:14:26,244 --> 00:14:28,488
Hello, Allie.

361
00:14:31,042 --> 00:14:34,011
JJ!
JJ!

362
00:14:35,288 --> 00:14:37,877
Responsible
parents, sucking helium.

363
00:14:38,325 --> 00:14:39,948
Oh, look,
Tina's doing it, too.

364
00:14:40,086 --> 00:14:42,122
Allie!
Oh, Allie!

365
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:43,572
 Tyler's mom showed up.

366
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:46,057
 We were both 
surprised to see her.

367
00:14:46,195 --> 00:14:47,300
-OK.
-Did you get cake?

368
00:14:47,817 --> 00:14:48,853
So we can go soon.

369
00:14:48,991 --> 00:14:50,027
Breanna.

370
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,134
Hello!

371
00:14:55,446 --> 00:14:56,826

Oh, I still sound funny.

372
00:14:56,965 --> 00:14:58,621
That is adorable.

373
00:14:58,759 --> 00:15:00,175
Oh, that's cute!

374
00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:02,349
 Everyone 
was having a good time,

375
00:15:02,867 --> 00:15:04,558
 and we got some necessary stuff.

376
00:15:04,938 --> 00:15:06,836
Oh, that baby's going
to have so many clothes.

377
00:15:06,975 --> 00:15:10,288
 But one person 
didn't seem that happy for us.

378
00:15:11,048 --> 00:15:12,256
-Who's that from?
-Rattler!

379
00:15:12,394 --> 00:15:13,878
Thank you,
that's very cute.

380
00:15:14,085 --> 00:15:15,915
My son just turned 16.

381
00:15:16,053 --> 00:15:17,192
He's going to be a dad,

382
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:19,849
and I just want to smack
them both upside the head.

383
00:15:19,988 --> 00:15:21,230
[groans]

384
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:24,337
He's seen me struggle with
the girls his whole life.

385
00:15:24,475 --> 00:15:26,201
And here he does--

386
00:15:27,409 --> 00:15:28,651
That's what's got me--

387
00:15:28,789 --> 00:15:29,929
And who's that from?

388
00:15:30,067 --> 00:15:32,276
-Aunt Becky.
-Thank you, Aunt Becky.

389
00:15:33,484 --> 00:15:35,796
Marissa, thank you!

390
00:15:36,694 --> 00:15:37,971
It's a bib.

391
00:15:38,109 --> 00:15:40,111
I'm ready to go home.

392
00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:42,286
This is just too much.

393
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,219
Thank you!
[laughing]

394
00:15:44,357 --> 00:15:46,221
Thank you so much.

395
00:15:47,118 --> 00:15:50,570
[laughing] That he's 16?

396
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:53,124
Going to have a baby?
Out of school?

397
00:15:53,262 --> 00:15:55,816
Smokes cigarettes
stays up all night?

398
00:15:56,576 --> 00:15:58,750
Yo, this thing is soft.

399
00:15:58,888 --> 00:16:00,235
Tyler's no angel.

400
00:16:00,373 --> 00:16:01,926
I expected more from him.

401
00:16:02,064 --> 00:16:04,204
Mom, you're missing
all of that outside.

402
00:16:04,342 --> 00:16:05,688
I'm watching.

403
00:16:05,826 --> 00:16:08,484
I love you, baby.
I'm going out for a cigarette.

404
00:16:13,455 --> 00:16:15,905
I hope Mom's around
for a long time

405
00:16:16,044 --> 00:16:18,356
because that baby's
going to need it.

406
00:16:18,701 --> 00:16:19,806
No.

407
00:16:19,944 --> 00:16:21,325
Don't even go there.

408
00:16:21,463 --> 00:16:23,327
Because you just--you'll
say something to piss me off,

409
00:16:23,465 --> 00:16:24,984
and I'll just piss you off.

410
00:16:25,122 --> 00:16:27,503
Nicole, I told her
her life was over.

411
00:16:27,641 --> 00:16:28,918
No more free time.

412
00:16:29,057 --> 00:16:30,092
It's not the baby's fault.

413
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,956
Ah, [bleep] bitch.

414
00:16:32,094 --> 00:16:33,475
Boy, aren't
we getting a little--

415
00:16:33,613 --> 00:16:35,028
Yeah, because I hate
that [bleep]..

416
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:36,892
-You bring it up every time.
-You brought it up.

417
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:38,307
No, you brought
the [bleep] up.

418
00:16:38,445 --> 00:16:39,895
-Don't even go there.
-Yeah.

419
00:16:40,033 --> 00:16:41,034
Go back inside.

420
00:16:41,172 --> 00:16:42,691
You're an immature 16-year-old.

421
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:44,589
You're a [bleep] bitch, Mom.

422
00:16:44,727 --> 00:16:47,385
Yo, that's real
respectful for a dad.

423
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:49,008
[bleep] you.

424
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:51,320
Oh, he's pathetic.

425
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,012
Hey, Tyler,
come here for a minute.

426
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:55,980
I want to leave.
I swear, I can't stand my mom.

427
00:16:56,118 --> 00:16:57,706
Tell me everything.

428
00:16:57,844 --> 00:16:58,810
She was like--she was like,
she goes, you're a 16-year-old

429
00:16:58,948 --> 00:17:00,295
-that's immature--
-Why?

430
00:17:00,433 --> 00:17:01,365
--and don't know
how to raise a kid.

431
00:17:01,503 --> 00:17:02,952
And I was like, really?

432
00:17:03,091 --> 00:17:05,024
Well, that's why I left
her house at 11 years old.

433
00:17:05,334 --> 00:17:07,819
Give him a good ass beating,
because that's what he needs.

434
00:17:07,957 --> 00:17:09,304
You need to go tell
your brother bye

435
00:17:09,442 --> 00:17:10,822
because it'll be
a long time before you

436
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:13,998
see or talk to him again.
Go.

437
00:17:14,136 --> 00:17:16,828
I love you so much.
Remember that, OK?

438
00:17:16,966 --> 00:17:18,140
I love you.

439
00:17:21,488 --> 00:17:22,800
I don't want to
talk to her no more.

440
00:17:22,938 --> 00:17:25,354
I'm sick of her.
I want her out of my life.

441
00:17:25,734 --> 00:17:28,806
 Tyler's mom had 
him when she was a teenager.

442
00:17:28,944 --> 00:17:32,223
 So if anybody should understand 
where we're at, it's her.

443
00:17:32,361 --> 00:17:33,707
 We don't need more drama.

444
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:35,882
 What we need is support.

445
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,090
Oh!

446
00:17:42,716 --> 00:17:44,891
[upbeat music]

447
00:17:45,029 --> 00:17:48,860
 Tyler hasn't gotten 
over the blow out with his mom.

448
00:17:49,378 --> 00:17:51,380
 But I think her 
calling him a slacker

449
00:17:51,518 --> 00:17:52,933
 is having an effect on him.

450
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:55,729
-So what's up, man?
-Been chillin', school.

451
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:57,317
I haven't been to school
in like, four years, man.

452
00:17:57,455 --> 00:17:58,594
Yeah.

453
00:17:58,732 --> 00:17:59,940
I need a change,
stay out of trouble.

454
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,115
-You need to go back to school.
-I know.

455
00:18:02,253 --> 00:18:04,083
I miss, like, being
able to go to school

456
00:18:04,221 --> 00:18:05,808
and have something
to do during the day

457
00:18:05,946 --> 00:18:07,465
because you have nothing
to do during the day.

458
00:18:07,603 --> 00:18:08,604
Yeah. I know.

459
00:18:08,742 --> 00:18:10,330
Like, that's why
I sleep all day.

460
00:18:10,848 --> 00:18:13,747
But I definitely
want to go to school.

461
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:15,266
-I want to go. I--
-You better.

462
00:18:17,337 --> 00:18:20,306
 Tyler always told me he 
was going to graduate someday.

463
00:18:20,444 --> 00:18:24,413
 And days before he was due to be 
a dad, he enrolled in a program

464
00:18:24,551 --> 00:18:25,932
 to complete his GED.

465
00:18:30,454 --> 00:18:33,905
 Now that I'm so close to my due 
date, contractions have started

466
00:18:34,043 --> 00:18:35,666
 and I'm getting 
really uncomfortable.

467
00:18:35,804 --> 00:18:39,290
 I'm trying to get this whole 
labor thing moving along.

468
00:18:39,428 --> 00:18:40,809
She's anxious.

469
00:18:40,947 --> 00:18:43,674
Nicole, you want to get
your jacket and let's go?

470
00:18:43,812 --> 00:18:45,676
Let's go start walking.

471
00:18:45,814 --> 00:18:47,195
You need to be active.

472
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,024
 My doctor 
said that keeping on my feet

473
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:50,681
 might kick start labor.

474
00:18:50,819 --> 00:18:52,200
I can't run no more.

475
00:18:52,338 --> 00:18:53,580
10 jumping jacks.

476
00:18:53,718 --> 00:18:55,099
One, two.
Let's go, come on, girl.

477
00:18:55,513 --> 00:18:56,583
Come on.

478
00:18:56,721 --> 00:18:58,758
[upbeat music]

479
00:19:00,311 --> 00:19:02,520
 I've also been told 
that some weird diets

480
00:19:02,658 --> 00:19:03,901
 can get labor going.

481
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:06,766
AI Steak Sauce
and macaroni and cheese.

482
00:19:06,904 --> 00:19:09,320
I'm about to throw up.

483
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:12,289
I drank Castor oil,
and nothing happened.

484
00:19:12,427 --> 00:19:14,429
It just gave me diarrhea.
[laughing]

485
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:16,224
Have you dilated at all?

486
00:19:16,362 --> 00:19:17,535
I had Tyler check.

487
00:19:17,673 --> 00:19:18,881
[laughing]

488
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:20,607
But he didn't know
what to look for,

489
00:19:20,745 --> 00:19:22,333
so it didn't really work out.

490
00:19:22,782 --> 00:19:25,198
We're going to put her
in my car with the bass all

491
00:19:25,336 --> 00:19:27,096
the way up so when
the baby starts,

492
00:19:27,235 --> 00:19:29,582
like, jiggling and dancing, it's
going to wiggle its way out.

493
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,447
Hey, do you know any
place that has speed bumps?

494
00:19:32,585 --> 00:19:35,898
If you go fast over a speed
bump, it causes labor.

495
00:19:36,036 --> 00:19:38,729
-And it wrecks your car.
-Let's do it.

496
00:19:38,867 --> 00:19:41,145
[tires screeching]

497
00:19:41,283 --> 00:19:43,320
-You ready?
-Yeah.

498
00:19:44,873 --> 00:19:47,082
[laughing]

499
00:19:49,049 --> 00:19:50,327
-That was a good one.
-Right here.

500
00:19:51,776 --> 00:19:53,778
-OK. I just got a pain.
-Really?

501
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:54,952
-Yeah.
-Oh, my God!

502
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:56,885
Let's do it again!

503
00:19:57,265 --> 00:19:58,990
 The speed 
bumps didn't work either.

504
00:19:59,128 --> 00:20:02,649
 I guess we'll just have to wait 
for nature to take its course.

505
00:20:02,787 --> 00:20:05,342
[guitar music]

506
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,172
Can I shoot pool right now?
No.

507
00:20:08,310 --> 00:20:09,725
Yeah.
You need to be walking around.

508
00:20:09,863 --> 00:20:11,831
Grandma, don't you think
shooting pool's good for her?

509
00:20:11,969 --> 00:20:13,695
It wouldn't hurt you.

510
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,041
[crack]

511
00:20:15,386 --> 00:20:17,354
 However odd Tyler's theory 
sounded,

512
00:20:17,492 --> 00:20:19,839
 my contractions 
started getting

513
00:20:19,977 --> 00:20:21,496
 intense and closer together.

514
00:20:23,152 --> 00:20:24,395
-You got to.
-I can't.

515
00:20:24,533 --> 00:20:26,017
-One more. Just one more, baby.
-I can't.

516
00:20:26,639 --> 00:20:30,401
I'll rack them and everything.
I want to see you break.

00:20:32,748 --> 00:20:34,060
I think we need to go, guys.

Let's go.

526
00:21:16,033 --> 00:21:18,484
 I wasn't laughing for long.

[pensive music]

528
00:21:22,073 --> 00:21:25,042
 I always saw myself as tough, 
but the pain got worse

529
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,768
 than I could ever imagine.

530
00:21:26,906 --> 00:21:30,323
The doctor came in about 15
minutes ago, broke her water,

531
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:32,256
and said now it should
start progressing.

532
00:21:32,394 --> 00:21:34,983
And they got her
on a ball right now,

533
00:21:35,121 --> 00:21:37,434
and she's crying really bad.

534
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:39,781
[sobs]

535
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:46,581
Well, the nurse said it could
be any time up to 12 hours.

[gasping and groaning]

539
00:21:55,521 --> 00:21:57,557
Come on, breathe.
You're doing good.

540
00:21:57,695 --> 00:21:59,421
Come on.
You're doing good.

541
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:00,664
Come on.

542
00:22:00,802 --> 00:22:03,874
[grunting]
[squeals and cries out]

543
00:22:04,012 --> 00:22:06,014
Oh, my God.

544
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,844
Deal with this a little bit
longer.

545
00:22:08,982 --> 00:22:10,294
Come on.
It's all right.

546
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:12,089
You're about
to get the epidural

547
00:22:12,227 --> 00:22:14,160
and it's just going to go by
so fast.

548
00:22:17,612 --> 00:22:19,441
 Finally, 
I was dilated enough

549
00:22:19,579 --> 00:22:21,374
 to get an epidural.

550
00:22:21,512 --> 00:22:24,204
 After 12 hours at the 
hospital, the nurse

551
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,965
 finally came in with good news.

552
00:22:26,103 --> 00:22:27,346
I talked to the doctor.

553
00:22:27,484 --> 00:22:29,037
He is on his way down.

554
00:22:29,175 --> 00:22:31,211
He doesn't want to wait, and
it's time to start pushing.

555
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,661
-This is it, kiddo.
-Oh, my God!

556
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:33,973
You'll have the baby
in the next 30 minutes.

557
00:22:34,111 --> 00:22:35,284
I can't wait.

558
00:22:35,423 --> 00:22:36,976
Tyler, you're
going to be a daddy.

559
00:22:37,114 --> 00:22:38,702
TINA: I can't wait to have
this baby here, honey.

560
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:41,463
I can't wait until she
just, whoosh, hello, baby.

561
00:22:41,601 --> 00:22:43,948
Go ahead and pull
those legs back.

562
00:22:44,086 --> 00:22:45,640
OK.

563
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:47,262
So on the next contraction
here, what I want to do is--

564
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,299
right now is-- and big push,
come on, push, push, push.

565
00:22:50,438 --> 00:22:51,680
This is it.
Push.

566
00:22:51,818 --> 00:22:53,958
Come on, keep pushing.
Push, push.

567
00:22:54,096 --> 00:22:55,063
Head's out.

[groaning]

569
00:22:58,791 --> 00:23:00,413
Hey, they just
did one push already

570
00:23:00,551 --> 00:23:02,242
and the baby's
head's already down.

571
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:03,658
-Well, hurry up and get there.
-Yes.

572
00:23:03,796 --> 00:23:05,280
That's what the
doctor just said.

573
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,145
Please don't pass out.

00:23:08,283 --> 00:23:09,353

-Nine pounds, six ounces.
-Oh, my God!

583
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:56,400
 I was happy so many people 
showed up to meet Brooklyn.

584
00:23:56,538 --> 00:23:59,852
 The one person I was surprised 
to see was Tyler's mom.

585
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,854
 She didn't say much, 
but just the fact

586
00:24:01,992 --> 00:24:04,132
 that she showed up said a lot.

587
00:24:09,689 --> 00:24:11,967
Well, she was born today.
What's today?

588
00:24:12,105 --> 00:24:13,659
January 17.

You sure got a cute little baby.

593
00:25:01,707 --> 00:25:03,363
 It's great to see

594
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,159
 Tyler's mom getting along 
for the last couple of days.

595
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:09,508
 And now the doctor says we're 
ready to take Brooklyn home.

596
00:25:09,646 --> 00:25:11,199
She's smiling.

597
00:25:11,337 --> 00:25:13,097

-I'm fine.

00:25:27,249 --> 00:25:29,113
She's awake now.
She's looking around.

602
00:25:31,357 --> 00:25:33,808
She say, where am I. What
is this contraption on me?

603
00:25:42,057 --> 00:25:45,716
 Tyler and I are nowhere 
near having a place of our own.

604
00:25:45,854 --> 00:25:47,994
 Our plan for now, is to 
go back and forth from

605
00:25:48,132 --> 00:25:50,272
 my mom's to Tyler's grandma's.

606

What?

-We got to change her.
-OK.

611
00:26:02,837 --> 00:26:04,597
I'm pretty sure.
You want me to change her?

612
00:26:04,735 --> 00:26:06,254
-If you want to.
-No, do you want to?

613
00:26:06,392 --> 00:26:07,669
-Go ahead.
-You sure.

614
00:26:07,807 --> 00:26:09,188
I'd ask you if you
want me to change her,

615
00:26:09,326 --> 00:26:11,017
but I know you're going
to do it. So I won't ask.

-No, go ahead.

-No.

Mm-mm.

The nurse said that she
looks fine down there.

624
00:26:27,344 --> 00:26:29,864
OK.

625
00:26:30,002 --> 00:26:31,382
She looks red to me.

Come on, baby.

She don't like this at all.

00:27:22,986 --> 00:27:24,401

can do it because I

don't want you being mad.

You're not going
to hurt her, honey.

660
00:27:40,348 --> 00:27:43,454
Just pull her little legs
up and get me a shirt.

661
00:27:43,592 --> 00:27:44,559
Here.

662
00:27:44,697 --> 00:27:46,078
You need some help, babe?

-Get her little arms here.
-I'm trying. I'm trying.

Take this
and push it down.

Yeah, but, grandma,
it's stuck on her back.

Well, we don't--no,
you get the arms in first--

OK, grandma.

pull them back down.

around her and Nicole

said it would be a good idea.

I asked him to quit.

678
00:28:16,349 --> 00:28:18,317
Think I'm gonna
call off school today

679
00:28:18,455 --> 00:28:20,215
because Brooklyn was born.

680
00:28:20,353 --> 00:28:23,425
 Tyler followed through 
and re-enrolled for his GED.

681
00:28:23,563 --> 00:28:26,152
 But I guess his first day 
of school in over four years

682
00:28:26,290 --> 00:28:27,533
 will have to wait.

684
00:28:29,535 --> 00:28:31,951
Hi, this is Tyler, um, I
was calling to tell you, um,

685
00:28:32,089 --> 00:28:33,263
I wouldn't be able
to make it today

686
00:28:33,401 --> 00:28:35,299
because my daughter
was just born.

687
00:28:35,817 --> 00:28:37,439
So is that all right though?

688
00:28:38,406 --> 00:28:39,614
Thank you.
Bye.

689
00:28:39,752 --> 00:28:41,581
 Tyler 
only missed one class

690
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,963
 and he's motivated 
to get his education

691
00:28:44,101 --> 00:28:49,555
 because he's got a new job and 
he's starting at the bottom.

692
00:28:49,693 --> 00:28:52,213
 And nobody expected it 
would come from his mom.

693
00:28:52,351 --> 00:28:53,766
 She hooked him up 
with the nursing home

694
00:28:53,904 --> 00:28:55,734
 where she works 
after she found out

695
00:28:55,872 --> 00:28:57,977
 that he went back to school.

696
00:28:58,115 --> 00:29:00,808
How is things
with Nicole and the baby?

697
00:29:00,946 --> 00:29:02,292
Good.

698
00:29:02,430 --> 00:29:03,569
Grandma?

699
00:29:03,707 --> 00:29:05,088
Fine.

700
00:29:05,226 --> 00:29:06,986
Other than staying on
your ass when she needs to?

701
00:29:07,124 --> 00:29:08,263
On everything.

702
00:29:08,401 --> 00:29:09,713
Well, you--
you're only 16, bud.

703
00:29:10,093 --> 00:29:12,405
I know but I'm doing everything
right. I go to school.

704
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:13,890
Yes, you went back to school.

705
00:29:14,028 --> 00:29:15,029
I go to work.

706
00:29:15,167 --> 00:29:16,340
I don't do nothing wrong.

707
00:29:16,478 --> 00:29:18,308
Just put your
priorities first.

708
00:29:18,446 --> 00:29:19,516
I do.

709
00:29:19,654 --> 00:29:20,517
-Finish school.
-I'm going to.

710
00:29:20,655 --> 00:29:22,519
-Go to college.
-I am.

711
00:29:22,899 --> 00:29:24,417
And get a good
paying job to take care

712
00:29:24,555 --> 00:29:26,454
of you, Nicole, and Brooklyn.

713
00:29:26,592 --> 00:29:29,457
 Tyler might not be that excited 
about his new line of work

714
00:29:29,595 --> 00:29:32,115
 but we'd be screwed if his 
mom didn't help us out.

715
00:29:32,253 --> 00:29:34,255
What made you come
around to talk to Tyler

716
00:29:34,393 --> 00:29:36,878
again, after what happened?

717
00:29:37,016 --> 00:29:38,742
-At the baby shower?
-Yeah.

718
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,986
Well, I missed him.

719
00:29:41,124 --> 00:29:45,300
Thought about Tyler every day
even though he's a butt-head.

720
00:29:45,438 --> 00:29:48,545
And I'm proud of Tyler
that he's gone back

721
00:29:48,683 --> 00:29:50,650
to school, which you need to.

722
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:51,859
I am.

723
00:29:51,997 --> 00:29:54,102
But, you're
always welcome here.

724
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:55,517
OK.

725
00:29:55,655 --> 00:29:57,036
Even though you
guys should've waited.

726
00:29:57,174 --> 00:29:58,589
Yeah.

727
00:29:58,727 --> 00:30:04,250
No more kids for quite
a while like in your 20's.

728
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:05,838
You know me and
Tyler want six?

729
00:30:08,876 --> 00:30:10,843
You'll change
your mind quickly.

730
00:30:10,981 --> 00:30:13,742
 I'm glad Farrah's proud to have 
a grandkid and I'm going

731
00:30:13,881 --> 00:30:18,230
 to respect her wish to not give 
her a bunch more anytime soon.

732
00:30:26,134 --> 00:30:28,412
 The cool thing about my mom is 
that she doesn't mind looking

733
00:30:28,550 --> 00:30:30,138
 after Brooklyn once in a while.

734
00:30:30,276 --> 00:30:31,415
OK, we'll be back.

735
00:30:31,553 --> 00:30:34,833
How about we watch TV?

736
00:30:35,661 --> 00:30:37,974
 Now that Tyler's working 
and going to school,

737
00:30:38,112 --> 00:30:40,459
 we don't want our lives 
to come to a complete stop.

738
00:30:40,597 --> 00:30:42,323
I didn't crash.
I won.

739
00:30:58,028 --> 00:31:00,306
She's content, now.

740
00:31:00,444 --> 00:31:02,170
She's in grandma's lap.

741
00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:14,182
All right.

742
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,529
Y'all gonna clean this mess up?

743
00:31:16,667 --> 00:31:19,878
I'm going to bed.
Goodnight.

744
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,647
Come on, sweetheart.

745
00:31:32,062 --> 00:31:34,237
Come on.

746
00:31:34,754 --> 00:31:36,446
What would you do
if I wasn't here?

747
00:31:43,832 --> 00:31:46,007
 Even though I'm supposed to be 
back in two months,

748
00:31:46,145 --> 00:31:49,183
 school seems like a 
million miles away.

749
00:31:49,321 --> 00:31:51,012
 My mom helps when she can.

750
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,841
She's not even drinking much.

751
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:55,016
 And Tyler and I are learning 
the ropes with Brooklyn.

752
00:31:57,467 --> 00:31:59,158
 So when things get 
to be too much--

753
00:31:59,296 --> 00:32:00,608
-Grandma.
-Yes?

754
00:32:00,746 --> 00:32:02,230
We're staying here tonight.

755
00:32:02,368 --> 00:32:04,923
 We know we can always move 
on to Tyler's grandma's.

756
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,824
Is it time
for you to wake up?

757
00:32:09,962 --> 00:32:11,308
Yeah.

758
00:32:11,446 --> 00:32:13,345
Are you going to
open those eyes?

759
00:32:16,382 --> 00:32:18,350
Tyler.

760
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,491
Are you going to get up?

761
00:32:21,629 --> 00:32:23,286
I'm going to put
some earplugs in.

762
00:32:23,424 --> 00:32:24,494
Why?

763
00:32:24,632 --> 00:32:26,151
So I can't hear you.

764
00:32:26,289 --> 00:32:27,980
All right.

765
00:32:31,121 --> 00:32:33,192
Just snoozing away.

766
00:32:33,330 --> 00:32:35,022
He's never going to get up.

767
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,713
 When grandma spent,

768
00:32:36,851 --> 00:32:39,958
 we give Tyler's mom some 
time with her granddaughter.

769
00:32:42,443 --> 00:32:44,376
Are you eating with us?

770
00:32:55,732 --> 00:32:57,285
We'll be back.

771
00:32:57,423 --> 00:32:58,666
Whatever.

772
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,427
Mom, can you help
me change her diaper?

773
00:33:01,565 --> 00:33:03,257
She went poop.

774
00:33:03,395 --> 00:33:06,122
 Everybody seems cool about 
pitching in with childcare,

775
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,952
 so I didn't see the harm 
in accepting the help.

776
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:17,857
 But I think shuttling 
our kid around

777
00:33:17,996 --> 00:33:20,550
 is starting to upset Farrah.

778
00:33:24,485 --> 00:33:25,658
What are we talking about?

779
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:28,489
-The house hopping--
-Oh God.

780
00:33:28,627 --> 00:33:30,146
It's not oh God, Tyler.

781
00:33:30,525 --> 00:33:31,802
Don't get all pissy.

782
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,632
We're not
doing nothing wrong.

783
00:33:34,771 --> 00:33:36,635
She wants
one stable home.

784
00:33:36,773 --> 00:33:38,809
No. She has a home
and she knows the home.

785
00:33:38,947 --> 00:33:40,501
You need
to think about her.

786
00:33:40,639 --> 00:33:41,985
Yeah, she's fine.

787
00:33:42,123 --> 00:33:43,538
We're doing everything
in our will to help her.

788
00:33:43,676 --> 00:33:45,230
Well, a lot of
people think different.

789
00:33:45,368 --> 00:33:46,852
Well, that's a lot of people.
That's their own opinions.

790
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:48,819
It's what the world's
full of, drama.

791
00:33:49,648 --> 00:33:51,339
I think everybody's
just concerned.

792
00:33:51,477 --> 00:33:53,479
They want her to have stability.

793
00:33:53,617 --> 00:33:54,929
We are stable.

794
00:33:55,067 --> 00:33:56,241
It's just not fair
for her to be bounced.

795
00:33:56,379 --> 00:33:57,932
Really?

796
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,521
She comes first before
going out, shooting pool--

797
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:02,316
[bleep] you say.

798
00:34:02,454 --> 00:34:05,250
Well, your freedom is done.

799
00:34:05,388 --> 00:34:06,596
Both of y'all.

800
00:34:06,734 --> 00:34:07,942
I'm sick of
everyone picking on us.

801
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,495
You see Tyler
wouldn't be getting upset

802
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:11,877
if none of this wasn't true.

803
00:34:55,023 --> 00:34:57,888
I knew she was gonna
[bleep] deal about that.

804
00:34:58,026 --> 00:34:59,890
It's just like every
time I come over there

805
00:35:00,028 --> 00:35:02,238
she's got something to
start with me about.

806
00:35:02,376 --> 00:35:07,105
She's kind of saying that we
never have the baby, I guess.

807
00:35:07,243 --> 00:35:09,003
I didn't do nothing wrong.

808
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:11,730
But we do go back
and forth a lot.

809
00:35:11,868 --> 00:35:13,180
Like, I'm agreeing with that.

810
00:35:13,318 --> 00:35:14,905
We do.

811
00:35:15,043 --> 00:35:17,943
 Tyler was bounced from house 
to house when he was a kid

812
00:35:18,081 --> 00:35:19,565
 and it was rough on him.

813
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:23,190
 We don't want the same 
for Brooklyn.

814
00:35:29,644 --> 00:35:31,750
 To find out what you can 
do to prevent pregnancy

815
00:35:31,888 --> 00:35:34,028
 go to itsyoursexlife.org.

816
00:35:39,585 --> 00:35:42,347
 We're letting things cool off 
between Tyler and his mom,

817
00:35:43,002 --> 00:35:45,315
 so we're staying at my mom's 
for a couple of days.

818
00:35:45,695 --> 00:35:48,318
 She's at work, 
so we're on our own.

819
00:35:49,561 --> 00:35:52,426
 Tyler's as helpful as he can be 
but between his school schedule

820
00:35:52,564 --> 00:35:56,913
 and his new job, I'm alone 
caring for Brooklyn tonight.

821
00:35:58,466 --> 00:36:00,296
[baby crying]

822
00:36:00,434 --> 00:36:03,920
 I know I should get her to 
sleep but she's the boss of me

823
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:06,198
 and she just doesn't 
want to go down.

824
00:36:14,068 --> 00:36:16,208
[knocking on door]

825
00:36:17,036 --> 00:36:19,970
Hey, beautiful.

826
00:36:20,108 --> 00:36:23,388
 I miss the girls, but now all 
I want to do is sleep.

827
00:36:23,526 --> 00:36:25,390
She's so big.

828
00:36:25,528 --> 00:36:27,357
Aw.

829
00:36:27,495 --> 00:36:28,531
You want her?

830
00:36:28,669 --> 00:36:30,878
Come here, baby.
Hey.

831
00:36:32,224 --> 00:36:33,777
So, how's it been
since you've been home?

832
00:36:33,915 --> 00:36:35,572
It's so
completely different.

833
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:38,023
Everything's on
Brooklyn's time now.

834
00:36:38,161 --> 00:36:40,508
Does she have a schedule
yet or is it whenever?

835
00:36:40,646 --> 00:36:41,889
Yeah, it's whenever.

836
00:36:42,027 --> 00:36:43,097
How are you going to
take care of Brooklyn

837
00:36:43,235 --> 00:36:44,340
and still go back to school?

838
00:36:44,478 --> 00:36:46,134
It's going to be really tough.

839
00:36:46,273 --> 00:36:48,378
It's like no sleep at all
if you had to go to school.

840
00:36:48,516 --> 00:36:51,381
If I want to get an
education to help raise her

841
00:36:51,761 --> 00:36:54,384
then that means no sleep then.
I have to do it.

842
00:36:54,522 --> 00:36:56,248
So are you home
alone during the day?

843
00:36:56,386 --> 00:36:58,216
Yeah.
Tyler's at work?

844
00:36:58,871 --> 00:37:02,289
Friends don't just
stop by like they used to?

845
00:37:02,427 --> 00:37:03,911
No.

846
00:37:04,049 --> 00:37:07,708
I don't feel like
a teenager anymore.

847
00:37:07,846 --> 00:37:09,951
-Look.
-She's smiling.

848
00:37:10,089 --> 00:37:11,988
-Look.
-Hey, what's up, guys?

849
00:37:12,126 --> 00:37:13,990
Give me my baby.

850
00:37:14,542 --> 00:37:15,612
Give me my baby.

851
00:37:15,750 --> 00:37:17,718
Hi, sweetheart. Hi.

852
00:37:17,856 --> 00:37:19,133
How was she all day?

853
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:21,135
I didn't go to sleep
until 8:00 this morning.

854
00:37:21,273 --> 00:37:24,000
-8 o'clock? Why?
-No.

855
00:37:24,138 --> 00:37:25,588
Because she was up.

856
00:37:25,726 --> 00:37:27,590
All night?

857
00:37:27,728 --> 00:37:29,281
What are you doing?

858
00:37:29,419 --> 00:37:31,041
You know what it is?
You being a new mom.

859
00:37:31,179 --> 00:37:33,112
You're still uncomfortable.

860
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,562
Well, you're not totally
comfortable with her

861
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,357
and she feels it.

862
00:37:36,737 --> 00:37:38,290
I'm not being mean.

863
00:37:38,428 --> 00:37:41,051
I'm just saying you guys need to
start coming around more often.

864
00:37:52,649 --> 00:37:55,583
You guys are going to be
a skating at the skate park?

865
00:37:56,895 --> 00:37:58,690
So you going to
leave baby with me?

866
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:05,731
-Why don't you say it?
-What?

867
00:38:05,869 --> 00:38:07,595
You guys are going
to leave her with me.

868
00:38:07,733 --> 00:38:09,528
Yeah.

869
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:12,462
OK.

870
00:38:17,398 --> 00:38:19,366
So, we're bringing
the baby with us?

871
00:38:19,987 --> 00:38:21,402
No.

872
00:38:34,104 --> 00:38:35,243
Hi, Brooklyn.

873
00:38:35,382 --> 00:38:36,797
Hi.

874
00:38:36,935 --> 00:38:39,178
 It's nice 
to have help from our families

875
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:40,973
 but this is me and Tyler's baby

876
00:38:41,111 --> 00:38:42,975
 and we're going to have to 
give up some of our freedom

877
00:38:43,113 --> 00:38:44,839
 to do what's best for her.

878
00:38:44,977 --> 00:38:46,531
Where do you want her to
grow up at your house or mine?

879
00:38:46,669 --> 00:38:48,395
I want to get our own place.

880
00:38:48,533 --> 00:38:50,845
So it's not at your house
or my house.

881
00:38:51,052 --> 00:38:52,778
It's our house.

882
00:38:53,089 --> 00:38:54,780
We just gotta save up.

883
00:38:54,918 --> 00:38:57,196
And then she can go visit
grandmas' on the weekends.

884
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:58,508
Yep.

885
00:38:58,819 --> 00:39:00,476
Are you excited to
take her back here

886
00:39:00,614 --> 00:39:01,960
when she's old enough to play?

887
00:39:02,098 --> 00:39:04,307
Yeah. She'll be running
all over the place.

888
00:39:04,445 --> 00:39:06,136
Daddy, push me. Push me.

889
00:39:06,274 --> 00:39:08,587
She'll be like teach me
how to do a back flip.

890
00:39:08,725 --> 00:39:10,071
I'm teaching
her how to do one.

891
00:39:10,209 --> 00:39:13,558
-OK, when she was 20.
-No. When she's five.

892
00:39:13,696 --> 00:39:16,699
-No.
-Yeah.

893
00:39:16,837 --> 00:39:18,563
If she's
anything like you,

894
00:39:18,701 --> 00:39:21,669
she's going to be a handful.

895
00:39:24,534 --> 00:39:26,053
Why don't you just
kiss me down here.

896
00:39:26,191 --> 00:39:27,399
No.

897
00:39:27,537 --> 00:39:29,332
He's hitting me.

898
00:39:33,819 --> 00:39:36,235
Yeah.
Don't jump on the table.

899
00:39:37,098 --> 00:39:39,963
 I'm starting to realize 
that my mom is right.

900
00:39:40,101 --> 00:39:43,381
 It's going to take time for 
us to learn how to be parents.

901
00:39:54,909 --> 00:39:56,290
My first
thought when I found out

902
00:39:56,428 --> 00:40:00,570
I was pregnant was like
once I had the baby Tyler

903
00:40:00,708 --> 00:40:02,710
would be gone
and I would be stuck

904
00:40:02,883 --> 00:40:05,368
a single mom like most girls.

905
00:40:06,024 --> 00:40:08,578
He could've left me when he
found out I was pregnant,

906
00:40:08,716 --> 00:40:10,615
but he chose not to
and he chose to stick

907
00:40:10,753 --> 00:40:12,617
with me through the hard times.

908
00:40:12,789 --> 00:40:14,135
For you, baby.

909
00:40:15,723 --> 00:40:18,899
Usually, a day is
just being home with the baby.

910
00:40:19,037 --> 00:40:20,245
It's not going out
with my friends

911
00:40:20,383 --> 00:40:22,005
anymore like it used to be.

912
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:26,458
I'm on baby time now and I
don't get to do what I want,

913
00:40:26,596 --> 00:40:28,184
when I want.

914
00:40:28,322 --> 00:40:29,910
You don't want daddy to win?

915
00:40:30,048 --> 00:40:31,739
Think I'm
going to have to fight

916
00:40:31,877 --> 00:40:35,225
pretty hard to make sure I'm
motivated to go to school.

917
00:40:35,363 --> 00:40:37,158
I think if we waited
and I went to college

918
00:40:37,296 --> 00:40:40,299
first everything would
have been a little easier.

919
00:40:40,714 --> 00:40:42,888
I want to Brooklyn
to go to school.

920
00:40:43,026 --> 00:40:45,822
And I want her to
wait to have kids

921
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:48,860
because I don't want her to
go through the hard times

922
00:40:48,998 --> 00:40:53,174
that I've been
through when I was 16.

923
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:08,327
She's like, honey,
you're having twins.

924
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:09,950
I was like--

925
00:41:10,088 --> 00:41:11,676
-Twice the amount of diapers.
-Twice the everything.

926
00:41:11,814 --> 00:41:13,160
Whether you want
to face it or not,

927
00:41:13,298 --> 00:41:14,955
you two have two kids for
the rest of your life.

928
00:41:15,093 --> 00:41:16,646
COREY: You have to
face you have a family.

929
00:41:16,784 --> 00:41:19,338
LEAH: How long was we together
before we got pregnant?

930
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,548
Not very long at all,
but does that matter?

931
00:41:21,893 --> 00:41:23,791
Was I in love?
No I wasn't.

932
00:41:23,929 --> 00:41:25,344
Do I think you
picked him over me?

933
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,656
Yeah, I do.

934
00:41:26,794 --> 00:41:28,589
Jealousy is going
to split us up.

935
00:41:28,727 --> 00:41:30,418
-Why are you crying?
-[Leah screaming]

936
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,008
-What did I [bleep] do?
-You make me insane!
