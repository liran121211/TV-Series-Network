3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:06,974
>> HOW MANY MASCARAS

4
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:07,708
ARE YOU USING?

5
00:00:07,708 --> 00:00:08,476
MY NAME'S JAMIE.

6
00:00:08,476 --> 00:00:09,310
I'M 17 YEARS OLD AND

7
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,678
FROM ASHEVILLE, NORTH CAROLINA

8
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:11,379
IN THE HEART

9
00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:12,480
OF THE BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS.

10
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:13,247
>> YOU WANT A LOT

11
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:14,448
OF CREAM CHEESE OR WHAT?

12
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:15,216
>> A LOT.

13
00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:15,916
>> ALL RIGHT.

14
00:00:15,916 --> 00:00:16,584
IT'S 7:00.

15
00:00:16,584 --> 00:00:17,951
>> MY DAD LEFT WHEN I WAS

16
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:19,753
A BABY, SO MY MOM RAISED ME AND

17
00:00:19,753 --> 00:00:22,223
MY BIG SISTER ALL BY HERSELF.

18
00:00:22,223 --> 00:00:23,224
AND SHE'S EXCITED FOR ME

19
00:00:23,224 --> 00:00:24,058
TO GRADUATE.

20
00:00:24,058 --> 00:00:25,359
>> I'M ENTITLED TO HAVE A LIFE.

21
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,527
I'VE RAISED YOU GUYS.

22
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,762
IT'S TIME FOR ME TO HAVE A LIFE.

23
00:00:28,762 --> 00:00:30,030
>> I'M HALFWAY THROUGH

24
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,065
MY SENIOR YEAR.

25
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:31,999
AND NEXT FALL,

26
00:00:31,999 --> 00:00:32,933
I WANT TO GO TO COLLEGE

27
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:35,436
AND STUDY RADIATION THERAPY.

28
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:37,105
I'M A REALLY GOOD STUDENT.

29
00:00:37,105 --> 00:00:37,971
I GET STRAIGHT "A"s,

30
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:39,540
AND I'M ON THE STUDENT COUNCIL.

31
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,874
WRITE ME DOWN FOR FUNDRAISING.

32
00:00:40,874 --> 00:00:42,710
SO EVERYONE WAS KIND OF SHOCKED

33
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:44,212
WHEN I STARTED DATING RYAN.

34
00:00:44,212 --> 00:00:44,912
HE'S A LITTLE

35
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:46,447
ROUGH AROUND THE EDGES.

36
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:47,348
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER

37
00:00:47,348 --> 00:00:48,149
FOR ABOUT A YEAR.

38
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,717
BUT BECAUSE WE'RE SO DIFFERENT,

39
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:50,618
IT HASN'T ALL BEEN

40
00:00:50,618 --> 00:00:52,220
SMOOTH SAILING.

41
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:54,722
RYAN IS KNOWN AS A BIG PARTIER

42
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:56,724
AND A TERRIBLE DRIVER.

43
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:57,958
AFTER GETTING A BUNCH OF

44
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,527
SPEEDING TICKETS AND A D.U.I.,

45
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:01,395
HE LOST HIS LICENSE.

46
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:03,231
NOW, INSTEAD OF CRUISING AROUND

47
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:03,897
IN HIS CAR,

48
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:05,466
WE HAVE TO RIDE THE SCHOOL BUS

49
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:07,501
AND BUM RIDES FROM MY MOM.

50
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:09,036
>> RYAN, I'M TAKING YOU HOME AND

51
00:01:09,036 --> 00:01:10,704
I'M GOING TO DONNY'S AFTERWARDS.

52
00:01:10,704 --> 00:01:11,972
MY MOM SPENDS A LOT OF TIME AT

53
00:01:11,972 --> 00:01:14,475
HER BOYFRIEND DONNY'S HOUSE.

54
00:01:14,475 --> 00:01:15,609
SO THINGS CAN GET PRETTY QUIET

55
00:01:15,609 --> 00:01:16,677
AROUND HERE SOMETIMES.

56
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:18,346
BUT IT'S NOT GONNA STAY THAT WAY

57
00:01:18,346 --> 00:01:20,648
BECAUSE I'M PREGNANT.

58
00:01:28,456 --> 00:01:30,057
GETTING PREGNANT WAS A BIG SHOCK

59
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:31,125
FOR ME AND RYAN.

60
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:31,925
BUT I'M GLAD

61
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,361
HE'S STANDING BY ME.

62
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:34,562
WE FOUND OUT WE'RE HAVING A

63
00:01:34,562 --> 00:01:37,398
GIRL, AND WE'RE NAMING HER MIAH.

64
00:01:37,398 --> 00:01:38,332
THAT MADE THE WHOLE THING

65
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:39,367
VERY REAL.

66
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:40,801
BUT IT ALSO MADE US FOCUS ON

67
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:41,635
WHY WE GOT TOGETHER

68
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:42,603
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

69
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:43,404
WHAT DID YOU THINK

70
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:44,372
WHEN YOU FIRST MET ME?

71
00:01:44,372 --> 00:01:46,940
>> YOU WERE KIND OF OUTGOING

72
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:50,878
AND NOT LIKE THE QUIET, SHY TYPE

73
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:52,112
I GUESS, YOU KNOW?

74
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:52,880
>> YEAH.

75
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,548
>> AND WE JUST CLICKED AFTER THE

76
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:56,650
FIRST TIME WE HUNG OUT, SO

77
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,319
IF I WASN'T TALKING, YOU WERE.

78
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,119
>> YEAH.

79
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,120
>> AND IF YOU WEREN'T TALKING,

80
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:00,688
I WAS.

81
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:01,755
>> AT THE TIME, WE BALANCED

82
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:03,056
EACH OTHER OUT, AND WE JUST

83
00:02:03,056 --> 00:02:04,658
HAD SO MUCH FUN TOGETHER.

84
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:06,059
WHEN YOU HAD YOUR CAR, WE WERE

85
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,328
RIDING AROUND ALL THE TIME AND

86
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:09,263
LIKE, FINALLY, I WAS JUST LIKE,

87
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:10,464
"YEAH, WE'LL DATE."

88
00:02:10,464 --> 00:02:13,033
AND THAT WAS

89
00:02:13,033 --> 00:02:15,102
A ROCKY RELATIONSHIP.

90
00:02:15,102 --> 00:02:16,437
BUT IT'S GOTTEN SO MUCH BETTER.

91
00:02:16,437 --> 00:02:17,438
LIKE, WE'VE GROWN TO,

92
00:02:17,438 --> 00:02:19,707
LIKE, TWO PARENTS.

93
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:20,508
>> YEAH.

94
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:22,009
A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY.

95
00:02:22,009 --> 00:02:24,345
>> CAN YOU HANDLE IT, RYAN?

96
00:02:24,345 --> 00:02:25,713
>> YOU NEVER CAN BE PREPARED

97
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:26,680
FOR IT, YOU KNOW?

98
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,615
>> YEAH.

99
00:02:27,615 --> 00:02:29,350
I KNOW.

100
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,451
MY FRIENDS THOUGHT

101
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:31,452
IT WAS SCANDALOUS ENOUGH

102
00:02:31,452 --> 00:02:33,086
THAT I WAS DATING RYAN,

103
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:34,422
SO FINDING OUT I WAS PREGNANT

104
00:02:34,422 --> 00:02:35,856
REALLY BLEW THEM AWAY.

105
00:02:35,856 --> 00:02:37,525
>> JAMIE IS PREGNANT?

106
00:02:37,525 --> 00:02:38,192
[laughs]

107
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:39,159
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO REACT.

108
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,127
>> YEAH.

109
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:41,395
>> YOU WERE ALWAYS, LIKE,

110
00:02:41,395 --> 00:02:43,464
THE BRAINS OF ALL OF US.

111
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:44,565
LIKE, YOU WOULD ALWAYS BE LIKE,

112
00:02:44,565 --> 00:02:45,199
"WAIT."

113
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,133
>> "Y'ALL CAN'T DO THIS."

114
00:02:46,133 --> 00:02:47,100
>> "WE GOT TO MAKE A PLAN."

115
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:47,768
[all laugh]

116
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:48,636
>> I WAS THE PLANNER.

117
00:02:48,636 --> 00:02:50,538
I HAD--WE HAD TO HAVE A PLAN

118
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:52,039
BEFORE WE DID ANYTHING.

119
00:02:52,039 --> 00:02:53,040
>> HOW DID YOU FIND OUT

120
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,874
YOU WERE PREGNANT?

121
00:02:53,874 --> 00:02:55,209
>> MY BODY WAS ACTING FUNNY.

122
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:56,377
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT IT WAS.

123
00:02:56,377 --> 00:02:57,478
I WAS JUST KIND OF LIKE, "OKAY,

124
00:02:57,478 --> 00:02:58,646
YOU KNOW, WHATEVER,

125
00:02:58,646 --> 00:03:00,514
THIS COULD BE TEENAGE BULL CRAP

126
00:03:00,514 --> 00:03:03,251
OR IT COULD BE THAT."

127
00:03:03,251 --> 00:03:05,719
AND I TOOK TWO PREGNANCY TESTS.

128
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:08,256
THEY BOTH CAME OUT POSITIVE.

129
00:03:08,256 --> 00:03:09,056
>> WAS YOU, LIKE,

130
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,758
USING A CONDOM, BIRTH CONTROL?

131
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:12,626
>> WELL...

132
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:13,861
[laughter]

133
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:14,995
WE DIDN'T USE EITHER.

134
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:15,996
>> LESSON LEARNED.

135
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:17,431
>> LESSON DEFINITELY LEARNED,

136
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:18,332
YOU GUYS.

137
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:20,501
DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE.

138
00:03:20,501 --> 00:03:21,335
>> SO ARE YOU SCARED

139
00:03:21,335 --> 00:03:22,736
TO ACTUALLY HAVE THE BABY, LIKE,

140
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:25,138
IN THE HOSPITAL AND...

141
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,340
>> IT'S SO NERVE-RACKING.

142
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:27,508
IT'S SO SCARY.

143
00:03:27,508 --> 00:03:28,242
AND I'M JUST--

144
00:03:28,242 --> 00:03:29,610
>> I CAN IMAGINE.

145
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,845
SO LIKE, RYAN, YOU THINK HE'S

146
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:33,814
GONNA STEP UP AND DO EVERYTHING

147
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:34,682
HE NEEDS TO DO?

148
00:03:34,682 --> 00:03:35,683
ARE YOU WORRIED THAT HE MIGHT

149
00:03:35,683 --> 00:03:37,985
SLIP UP SOMETIMES OR...

150
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:38,852
AND IT'S GONNA JUST

151
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:40,187
GET PUT ALL ON YOU?

152
00:03:40,187 --> 00:03:42,055
>> I'M SCARED OF THAT.

153
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:42,790
>> YEAH?

154
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,024
>> HE DOESN'T

155
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,526
FULLY UNDERSTAND IT.

156
00:03:45,526 --> 00:03:47,060
LIKE, FROM THE DAY

157
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,362
THAT I FOUND OUT, YOU GUYS SAW

158
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:50,030
THE BIGGEST CHANGE IN ME.

159
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,199
AND THEN YOU SAW HIM STILL...

160
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:53,467
>> WE'RE GONNA SEE A DRASTIC

161
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,703
CHANGE WHEN SHE'S BORN.

162
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:56,504
>> WHEN HE SEES--

163
00:03:56,504 --> 00:03:57,538
>> I REALLY HOPE SO, LIKE--

164
00:03:57,538 --> 00:03:58,672
>> A MOTHER BECOMES MOTHER

165
00:03:58,672 --> 00:03:59,707
WHEN SHE GETS PREGNANT.

166
00:03:59,707 --> 00:04:00,741
A FATHER BECOMES A FATHER

167
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,410
WHEN HE SEES HIS BABY.

168
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,812
>> I DON'T KNOW.

169
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:06,113
IT'S SCARY TO THINK ABOUT

170
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:07,881
THE FUTURE.

171
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,650
>> YEAH.

172
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:10,951
>> I USED TO HAVE EVERY DETAIL

173
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:12,420
OF MY FUTURE PLANNED OUT,

174
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,187
BUT NOW I'M NOT SO SURE

175
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,155
WHAT'S AHEAD OF ME.

176
00:04:15,155 --> 00:04:16,824
AND THAT'S PRETTY SCARY.

177
00:04:16,824 --> 00:04:17,758
BUT NOTHING COMPARES

178
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:19,327
TO THE DAY I HAD TO TELL MY MOM

179
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,861
I WAS HAVING A BABY.

180
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:21,962
SHE'S STILL PRETTY UPSET

181
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:23,331
ABOUT IT, BUT IS BEING

182
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:24,532
AS SUPPORTIVE AS SHE CAN.

183
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:25,466
>> YOU GOT YOUR DOCTOR'S

184
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:27,000
APPOINTMENT TOMORROW, RIGHT?

185
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,036
>> YES.

186
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:29,770
>> YOU KNOW HOW

187
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,904
YOU'RE GETTING THERE?

188
00:04:30,904 --> 00:04:32,340
>> POSSIBLY MY LOVELY,

189
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,106
AWESOME MOTHER?

190
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:33,741
>> HA-HA.

191
00:04:33,741 --> 00:04:34,375
>> HA-HA.

192
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:35,476
>> YOUR LOVELY, AWESOME MOTHER

193
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:38,011
HAS TO WORK.

194
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:39,012
>> SO WHAT WERE YOU THINKING

195
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:41,048
WHEN, LIKE, WHEN I FIRST TOLD

196
00:04:41,048 --> 00:04:42,816
YOU, LIKE, WHEN I WALKED OUT

197
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,117
AND WAS JUST LIKE,

198
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:45,619
"I NEED TO TALK TO YOU"?

199
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:46,854
>> I WASN'T EXPECTING YOU TO

200
00:04:46,854 --> 00:04:48,556
TELL ME YOU WERE PREGNANT.

201
00:04:48,556 --> 00:04:50,524
SO I WAS PISSED.

202
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:51,559
>> YEAH.

203
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:53,661
>> AND I CRIED A BUNCH.

204
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:55,262
>> I'M SORRY.

205
00:04:55,262 --> 00:04:57,365
>> AND I PRETTY MUCH DECIDED

206
00:04:57,365 --> 00:04:59,032
THAT YOU WERE...

207
00:04:59,032 --> 00:04:59,800
>> NOT HAVING IT.

208
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,134
>> YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.

209
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,403
>> BUT I TOLD YOU RIGHT THEN AND

210
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:04,271
THERE I WAS GONNA HAVE THE BABY.

211
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:05,205
>> AND YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT

212
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:06,206
I COULD TALK YOU OUT OF THAT.

213
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:08,842
YOU HAVE NO IDEA

214
00:05:08,842 --> 00:05:09,677
WHAT YOU'RE IN FOR.

215
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:10,844
YOU REALLY DON'T.

216
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:12,145
TRY STAYING UP ALL NIGHT WITH

217
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:14,047
A BABY AND THEN GOING TO CLASS

218
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:15,115
AND STAYING UP ALL NIGHT

219
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:15,916
WITH A SICK CHILD

220
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,551
AND GETTING READY FOR TESTS

221
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,587
AND WORKING IN BETWEEN.

222
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:21,221
>> I KNOW.

223
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:21,889
>> NO.

224
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:23,223
BUT YOU WILL.

225
00:05:23,223 --> 00:05:24,124
>> I THINK I CAN HANDLE

226
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:27,160
THE STRESS BETTER THAN RYAN.

227
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,496
YOU KNOW HE DOESN'T HANDLE

228
00:05:28,496 --> 00:05:30,097
STRESS VERY WELL.

229
00:05:30,097 --> 00:05:31,799
>> HE'S A 17-YEAR-OLD KID

230
00:05:31,799 --> 00:05:34,101
TRYING TO BE A GROWN-UP.

231
00:05:34,101 --> 00:05:35,403
AND HE DOESN'T QUITE

232
00:05:35,403 --> 00:05:37,070
KNOW HOW TO PULL OFF...

233
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:37,938
>> THE GROWN-UP PART.

234
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:38,572
>> RIGHT.

235
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:39,573
AND YOU'VE GOT TO BE PREPARED

236
00:05:39,573 --> 00:05:41,174
TO DO IT ALONE.

237
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:42,175
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS GROWING UP

238
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,276
WITHOUT A DAD.

239
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,845
>> YEAH.

240
00:05:44,845 --> 00:05:46,146
MY MOM HAS HAD HER SHARE OF

241
00:05:46,146 --> 00:05:47,981
RELATIONSHIP DRAMA IN HER LIFE,

242
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:49,216
AND SHE'S NEVER BEEN

243
00:05:49,216 --> 00:05:50,518
A BIG FAN OF RYAN.

244
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:51,919
SO SHE DOESN'T HAVE MUCH FAITH

245
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,053
IN HIM.

246
00:05:53,053 --> 00:05:55,188
I HAVE TO BELIEVE IN HIM.

247
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:56,624
BUT THE TRUTH IS, HE'S GONNA

248
00:05:56,624 --> 00:05:58,225
HAVE TO CHANGE HIS PARTYING WAYS

249
00:05:58,225 --> 00:05:59,693
AND GROW UP FAST.

250
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:00,728
>> LIKE, I WANT TO MOVE OUT

251
00:06:00,728 --> 00:06:02,730
AND--IF YOU WASN'T PREGNANT,

252
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:03,797
I COULD JUST MOVE OUT, YOU KNOW,

253
00:06:03,797 --> 00:06:04,565
NO PROBLEM.

254
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:05,733
>> YOU COULD LIVE WITH A FRIEND,

255
00:06:05,733 --> 00:06:06,700
YEAH.

256
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,635
YEAH, BUT I DON'T EXACTLY

257
00:06:07,635 --> 00:06:08,502
WANT YOU TO BE LIVING

258
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:11,472
WITH YOUR FRIENDS 'CAUSE...

259
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:12,673
IF YOU STOPPED HANGING OUT WITH

260
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,542
PEOPLE WHO DO THINGS LIKE THAT,

261
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:16,777
THEN YOU PROBABLY WOULD STOP.

262
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:18,345
>> I'VE STOPPED HANGING OUT WITH

263
00:06:18,345 --> 00:06:20,113
EVERYONE FOR A LONG TIME,

264
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,916
BUT I'VE STILL ALWAYS SOMEHOW

265
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:25,152
MANAGED TO DO SOMETHING

266
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:26,887
THAT I SHOULDN'T BE DOING.

267
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:27,955
>> WE HAVE SO MUCH

268
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:31,158
TO WORRY ABOUT WITH MIAH.

269
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:33,060
WE CAN'T--WE HAVE TO THINK

270
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,394
ABOUT HOW WE'RE GONNA

271
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:35,328
PROVIDE FOR HER.

272
00:06:35,328 --> 00:06:38,131
IT'S NOT US ANYMORE, IT'S HER.

273
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:38,866
I HAVE FAITH

274
00:06:38,866 --> 00:06:39,800
THAT YOU'LL BE A GOOD DAD.

275
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,301
I REALLY DO.

276
00:06:41,301 --> 00:06:42,335
BUT YOU KNOW, YOU ALWAYS HAVE TO

277
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:44,438
HAVE THOSE THOUGHTS.

278
00:06:44,438 --> 00:06:45,773
>> REGARDLESS, I CAN PROMISE

279
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:47,475
THAT I'M GONNA BE THERE FOR HER,

280
00:06:47,475 --> 00:06:48,909
BE IN HER LIFE.

281
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:49,943
>> YEAH.

282
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:50,711
>> I'M DEFINITELY

283
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:51,512
GONNA BE THERE.

284
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:52,580
>> I REALLY WANT TO

285
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,347
BELIEVE IN RYAN

286
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:55,315
AND HOPE HE TRADES IN

287
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:56,183
HIS BAD HABITS

288
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:57,985
FOR A CHANGE AT FATHERHOOD.

289
00:07:11,064 --> 00:07:12,933
>> I GOT COURT TOMORROW, SO--

290
00:07:12,933 --> 00:07:13,967
>> IS YOUR LAWYER GONNA BE

291
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:14,835
THERE?

292
00:07:14,835 --> 00:07:15,969
>> YEAH.

293
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:17,471
>> WHEN WE FOUND OUT I WAS

294
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,106
PREGNANT, RYAN SAID HE WOULD

295
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:20,273
TAKE ME TO ALL OF MY DOCTOR

296
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,274
APPOINTMENTS.

297
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,043
BUT SINCE HE LOST HIS LICENSE,

298
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,945
HE CAN'T TAKE ME ANYWHERE.

299
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:25,779
>> I THOUGHT RYAN

300
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:26,880
WAS GONNA BE ABLE--

301
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:27,548
>> TO COME?

302
00:07:27,548 --> 00:07:28,215
>> YEAH.

303
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:29,316
>> YEAH, I DID TOO, BUT LAST

304
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:31,284
NIGHT HE SAID HE HAD TO GO TO

305
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,286
HIS LAWYER TODAY SO--

306
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,254
>> HE SHOULD PROBABLY TRY TO

307
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:35,589
MAKE ALL OF HIS APPOINTMENTS

308
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:37,891
NOT ON WEDNESDAY.

309
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:38,859
>> OKAY.

310
00:07:38,859 --> 00:07:40,293
I HATE DEPENDING ON YOU,

311
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:42,395
AND RYAN DOES TOO, SO--

312
00:07:42,395 --> 00:07:43,564
>> WELL, IF HE DOESN'T GET A

313
00:07:43,564 --> 00:07:45,165
LICENSE BACK, YOU HAVE A WHOLE

314
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:47,801
YEAR TO DEPEND ON ME.

315
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:50,003
>> [sighs]

316
00:07:50,003 --> 00:07:51,238
>> HAVE A SEAT ON THE TABLE.

317
00:07:51,238 --> 00:07:52,372
AND MOM, IF YOU'LL HAVE A SEAT

318
00:07:52,372 --> 00:07:53,106
ON THE CHAIR.

319
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,842
>> HOW Y'ALL DOING TODAY?

320
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:55,743
>> GOOD.

321
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:56,577
>> HOW ARE YOU?

322
00:07:56,577 --> 00:08:01,715
>> SUPER.

323
00:08:01,715 --> 00:08:02,950
>> SEE THAT ONE.

324
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,586
>> YOU'RE MEASURING RIGHT AT 37.

325
00:08:05,586 --> 00:08:07,054
>> SO I'M NOT SMALL ANYMORE?

326
00:08:07,054 --> 00:08:07,721
>> MM-MM.

327
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:08,589
>> [grunts]

328
00:08:08,589 --> 00:08:09,690
THANK YOU.

329
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:11,258
>> YOU'RE NOW IN THE FULL-TERM

330
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:12,192
ZONE.

331
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:13,827
YOU KNOW, MOST PEOPLE HAVE THEIR

332
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,462
BABY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 39

333
00:08:15,462 --> 00:08:17,330
AND 41 WEEKS, SO I WOULD IMAGINE

334
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,166
SOMETIME OVER THE NEXT

335
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:20,433
FEW WEEKS.

336
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,535
>> THAT SHE'LL BE HERE.

337
00:08:21,535 --> 00:08:22,636
>> LABOR WILL START.

338
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:23,470
WHAT ARE YOU THE MOST

339
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,305
WORRIED ABOUT AT THIS POINT?

340
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:26,774
>> UH,

341
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:27,841
STRETCH MARKS.

342
00:08:27,841 --> 00:08:28,609
>> STRETCH MARKS.

343
00:08:28,609 --> 00:08:29,843
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA

344
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:30,778
HOW TO GET RID OF THOSE?

345
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:32,012
>> THEY'RE JUST GONNA BE

346
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:33,113
A PART OF YOUR LIFE.

347
00:08:33,113 --> 00:08:33,914
YOU KNOW, PART OF

348
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,048
YOUR LIFE STORY TO HAVE

349
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:38,018
A FEW STRETCH MARKS.

350
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,553
>> YAY.

351
00:08:39,553 --> 00:08:40,688
>> WE'LL SEE YOU BACK IN A WEEK

352
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:42,522
UNLESS YOU GO INTO LABOR.

353
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,490
>> THANK YOU.

354
00:08:43,490 --> 00:08:44,357
>> ALL RIGHT.

355
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,693
>> THIS IS THE THIRD STRAIGHT

356
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:46,694
DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT

357
00:08:46,694 --> 00:08:48,061
RYAN HAS MISSED.

358
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:49,396
I KNOW HE NEEDS TO DEAL WITH

359
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:50,497
HIS LEGAL ISSUES,

360
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:51,599
BUT I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME

361
00:08:51,599 --> 00:08:53,934
HIS PRIORITIES CHANGE.

362
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:55,068
>> I MEAN, I ALWAYS WANT TO GO

363
00:08:55,068 --> 00:08:56,336
TO YOUR DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS,

364
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:57,738
AND YOU KNOW I ALWAYS DO UNLESS

365
00:08:57,738 --> 00:08:59,072
I HAVE TO GO TO COURT OR--

366
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,140
>> I KNOW.

367
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,474
LIKE, I TRY TO EXPLAIN THAT

368
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,676
TO MOM, LIKE THOSE TIMES

369
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:04,277
THAT YOU HAVEN'T BEEN--

370
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:05,245
>> WAS SHE UPSET ABOUT THAT,

371
00:09:05,245 --> 00:09:06,614
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T CAME

372
00:09:06,614 --> 00:09:07,414
A COUPLE TIMES?

373
00:09:07,414 --> 00:09:08,481
>> IT'S NOT THAT SHE'S UPSET.

374
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,118
SHE'S JUST AFRAID THAT IT'S THE

375
00:09:11,118 --> 00:09:14,755
BEGINNING OF SOMETHING WORSE.

376
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:15,756
>> I MEAN, I UNDERSTAND THAT.

377
00:09:15,756 --> 00:09:16,657
>> AND I MEAN, YOU KNOW,

378
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:17,591
SHE HAS TO THINK ABOUT IT

379
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:18,892
LIKE THAT 'CAUSE SHE--

380
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,394
BUT LIKE, LATELY, I THINK, LIKE,

381
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:22,596
THE STRESS HAS BEEN GETTING TO

382
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:23,931
ME, AND IT'S BEEN A LOT.

383
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:25,565
>> AND IT'S, LIKE, EVEN HARDER

384
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:28,769
FOR ME TO DEAL WITH JUST BECAUSE

385
00:09:28,769 --> 00:09:30,270
ALL THIS OTHER STUFF I GOT

386
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:32,472
GOING ON ON TOP OF EVERYTHING

387
00:09:32,472 --> 00:09:33,607
WE HAVE TOGETHER.

388
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:35,075
I JUST LOVE YOU, AND I DON'T

389
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:36,276
WANT TO SEE YOU GET HURT

390
00:09:36,276 --> 00:09:37,077
ANY MORE THAN

391
00:09:37,077 --> 00:09:38,946
YOU'VE ALREADY BEEN HURT.

392
00:09:38,946 --> 00:09:41,448
YOU KNOW, LIKE, FOR EXAMPLE,

393
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:44,484
THE SUBJECT OF YOUR DAD.

394
00:09:44,484 --> 00:09:45,619
I MEAN,

395
00:09:45,619 --> 00:09:49,690
I KNOW HOW BAD IT HURTS YOU.

396
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,791
>> RYAN IS RIGHT.

397
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,259
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY DAD

398
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,627
HAS BEEN REALLY HARD ON ME.

399
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:55,262
HE HAS A NEW FAMILY NOW,

400
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,029
AND IT SEEMS LIKE

401
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:57,464
I'M NEVER ON HIS MIND.

402
00:09:57,464 --> 00:09:59,066
HE DIDN'T CALL ME ON MY BIRTHDAY

403
00:09:59,066 --> 00:10:00,267
AND HASN'T WANTED TO SEE ME

404
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:02,469
SINCE I GOT PREGNANT.

405
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:04,838
>> WHAT'D YOUR DAD SAY?

406
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:06,974
>> HE SAW IT ON MYSPACE.

407
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:08,809
HE SAW THE, LIKE, BABY STUFF

408
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:09,743
THAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT.

409
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:11,244
>> HE FOUND OUT BY MYSPACE?

410
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:13,080
>> BUT LISTEN, OKAY?

411
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,081
HE TEXTED ME, AND HE WAS LIKE,

412
00:10:14,081 --> 00:10:14,948
"SO WHAT IS THIS STUFF

413
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:15,683
ABOUT A BABY?"

414
00:10:15,683 --> 00:10:16,616
HE SAID, "PLEASE, PLEASE,

415
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:17,250
NO BABY."

416
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:19,586
THOSE ARE HIS EXACT WORDS.

417
00:10:19,586 --> 00:10:21,955
HE'S REALLY ANGRY.

418
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:23,323
>> SO HE'S DISAPPOINTED IN YOU.

419
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:24,257
>> HE HAS NO REASON TO BE,

420
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:24,925
THOUGH.

421
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:26,660
HE WAS NEVER IN MY LIFE.

422
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:30,063
HE NEVER TOOK CARE OF ME.

423
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:31,665
>> BUT I MEAN, ONCE HE SEES THAT

424
00:10:31,665 --> 00:10:34,201
YOU CAN BE PREGNANT AND BE 16

425
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:36,269
AND GO TO SCHOOL AT THE SAME

426
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,304
TIME AND MAKE SOMETHING OUT OF

427
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:38,305
YOUR LIFE, HE'S GONNA WANT TO

428
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,072
BE PART OF THAT,

429
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:39,907
PERIOD.

430
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:40,908
>> I DON'T THINK THAT'S GONNA

431
00:10:40,908 --> 00:10:41,641
MATTER TO HIM.

432
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:46,113
IT'S NEVER MATTERED TO HIM.

433
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:47,414
I WISH I COULD JUST WRITE OFF

434
00:10:47,414 --> 00:10:49,149
MY DAD ENTIRELY,

435
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,083
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THE MORE

436
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,051
I TRY TO FORGET ABOUT HIM,

437
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:52,853
THE SADDER I GET.

438
00:10:59,626 --> 00:11:00,861
I DON'T WANT MIAH

439
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:03,063
SURROUNDED BY FAMILY DRAMA,

440
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:04,531
SO I DECIDED TO REACH OUT

441
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:06,566
TO MY DAD ONE MORE TIME.

442
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,468
SO HOW DOES THE PARK

443
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:10,303
OFF OF AMBOY ROAD SOUND?

444
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:11,271
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE,

445
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,073
BUT FOR SOME REASON, MY DAD

446
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:14,742
ACTUALLY AGREED TO MEET ME.

447
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:15,809
>> COME HOME WITH ME TODAY.

448
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:16,476
>> I CAN'T.

449
00:11:16,476 --> 00:11:17,344
>> YOU KNOW YOUR DAD'S

450
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:18,145
NOT GONNA SHOW UP.

451
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:18,846
>> HE MIGHT.

452
00:11:18,846 --> 00:11:19,713
I CAN'T BAIL ON MY DAD

453
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:20,781
IF HE'S ACTUALLY GONNA SHOW UP.

454
00:11:20,781 --> 00:11:21,614
>> HE DOES IT TO YOU.

455
00:11:21,614 --> 00:11:22,349
ALL THE TIME.

456
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:22,983
>> OKAY.

457
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:23,817
I AM NERVOUS,

458
00:11:23,817 --> 00:11:25,753
'CAUSE HE HASN'T MET YOU YET.

459
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:26,987
I THINK I'M ALWAYS NERVOUS

460
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:28,822
WHEN I SEE MY DAD.

461
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:29,990
>> LOOK AT YOU.

462
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,391
>> WHAT'S GOING ON?

463
00:11:31,391 --> 00:11:33,326
>> NOT MUCH.

464
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:39,266
OH, MY BIG BABY.

465
00:11:39,266 --> 00:11:40,033
>> HEY, NAOMI,

466
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,601
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

467
00:11:41,601 --> 00:11:42,770
>> HI, I'M JOHN.

468
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:43,570
NICE TO MEET YOU.

469
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,504
>> NICE TO MEET YOU, MAN.

470
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:45,272
>> HEY, DUSTIN.

471
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:45,973
HOW ARE YOU?

472
00:11:45,973 --> 00:11:47,107
>> THIS YOUR LITTLE BROTHER?

473
00:11:47,107 --> 00:11:50,778
>> YES, THIS IS RYAN, DUSTIN.

474
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:52,445
>> SO YOU GUYS PRETTY PREPARED

475
00:11:52,445 --> 00:11:53,613
FOR THIS BIG STEP?

476
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:54,581
>> WELL, AS PREPARED

477
00:11:54,581 --> 00:11:55,382
AS WE CAN BE.

478
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,950
WE'RE PRETTY YOUNG, SO--

479
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:58,051
>> YEAH.

480
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,953
WELL.

481
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:00,954
>> RYAN, WOULD YOU AND DUSTIN

482
00:12:00,954 --> 00:12:01,721
LIKE TO GO DOWN

483
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:02,589
AND WALK TO THE CREEK?

484
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:03,623
>> YEAH, MAYBE GIVE JAMIE AND

485
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:07,127
HER DAD HAVE SOME TIME TO TALK.

486
00:12:07,127 --> 00:12:08,128
>> ALL RIGHT.

487
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:08,929
>> LOVE YOU.

488
00:12:08,929 --> 00:12:13,666
>> LOVE YOU TOO.

489
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:15,302
>> MY BABY'S HAVING A BABY.

490
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:16,536
>> THAT'S WHAT MOM SAYS.

491
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,105
>> DON'T EXACTLY KNOW HOW I

492
00:12:18,105 --> 00:12:20,140
FEEL ABOUT IT, BUT I'M NOT--

493
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,074
>> YOU DIDN'T TEXT ME BACK

494
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,642
WHEN I TOLD YOU I WAS PREGNANT.

495
00:12:22,642 --> 00:12:23,710
YOU WERE JUST LIKE, "SERIOUSLY?"

496
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,813
AND THEN DIDN'T TEXT ME BACK.

497
00:12:25,813 --> 00:12:29,382
>> I NEEDED TIME TO SWALLOW

498
00:12:29,382 --> 00:12:31,985
EVERYTHING AND UNDERSTAND AND--

499
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:32,920
>> I GUESS THAT'S WHY YOU

500
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,687
COULDN'T CALL ME ON MY BIRTHDAY.

501
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,355
>> [sighs]

502
00:12:35,355 --> 00:12:36,123
I DID TALK TO YOU

503
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:37,090
ON YOUR BIRTHDAY.

504
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,758
YOU TEXTED ME, DIDN'T YOU?

505
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,094
I THOUGHT WE TALKED.

506
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,797
I'M SORRY I MISSED THAT.

507
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:44,564
>> I KNOW, LIKE,

508
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:45,665
WE DON'T REALLY SEE EACH OTHER.

509
00:12:45,665 --> 00:12:46,733
DO YOU WANT TO CHANGE THAT

510
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:47,500
A LITTLE MORE

511
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,568
AND LIKE, SPEND TIME

512
00:12:48,568 --> 00:12:49,602
WITH YOUR GRANDDAUGHTER?

513
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,270
>> SURE.

514
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,906
YEAH, OF COURSE, I DO.

515
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:53,640
AND I'M THERE.

516
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:54,441
YOU CAN CALL ME.

517
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:55,909
I WANT TO GO DO SOMETHING.

518
00:12:55,909 --> 00:12:56,676
MY PHONE'S--

519
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:58,311
MY PHONE LINE'S OPEN.

520
00:12:58,311 --> 00:12:59,079
>> WELL, I MEAN,

521
00:12:59,079 --> 00:13:00,113
THE PHONE WORKS BOTH WAYS TOO.

522
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,614
>> YEAH.

523
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,649
>> SO--

524
00:13:02,649 --> 00:13:03,616
>> WELL, I'LL HAVE TO MAKE A

525
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,618
POINT OF IT TO BE MORE INVOLVED.

526
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,888
>> THAT WOULD BE NICE.

527
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:09,122
>> YOU KNOW.

528
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:09,990
>> DO YOU WANT TO COME

529
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,757
TO THE HOSPITAL?

530
00:13:10,757 --> 00:13:12,392
>> OF COURSE I'LL BE THERE.

531
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:14,227
OF COURSE I'LL BE THERE.

532
00:13:14,227 --> 00:13:14,895
>> I WONDER

533
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:15,829
IF SHE'LL HAVE OUR NOSES.

534
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:16,964
>> OH, NO.

535
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:18,198
THE CURSE.

536
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:19,732
[both laugh]

537
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:22,402
THE CURSE, YEAH.

538
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:23,403
>> I REALLY WANT MY DAD

539
00:13:23,403 --> 00:13:25,973
BACK IN MY LIFE.

540
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:27,174
AND IT MAKES ME REALIZE

541
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:28,808
HOW MUCH I WANT MIAH TO HAVE ONE

542
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,610
IN HER LIFE TOO.

543
00:13:39,619 --> 00:13:40,587
>> HAVE I EVER

544
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:41,588
DONE YOUR MASCARA?

545
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:42,489
DO YOU TRUST ME

546
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,624
TO DO YOUR MASCARA?

547
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:45,425
>> I TRIED TO PUT

548
00:13:45,425 --> 00:13:46,359
A PAIR OF MY PANTS ON.

549
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:48,428
MY BUTT IS TOO BIG FOR THEM.

550
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:49,396
I'M AFRAID IF I SIT,

551
00:13:49,396 --> 00:13:50,097
THEY'LL RIP.

552
00:13:50,097 --> 00:13:51,264
>> [laughs]

553
00:13:51,264 --> 00:13:52,132
>> BUT YOU'RE GONNA BE

554
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:53,100
SMALL AGAIN.

555
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,968
>> I HOPE SO.

556
00:13:54,968 --> 00:13:57,470
MIAH'S DUE IN JUST A FEW WEEKS,

557
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:59,106
AND I WON'T BE ABLE TO HANG OUT

558
00:13:59,106 --> 00:14:00,107
WITH MY FRIENDS AS MUCH

559
00:14:00,107 --> 00:14:01,608
ONCE SHE'S HERE, SO I'M DYING

560
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:02,642
TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE

561
00:14:02,642 --> 00:14:07,347
WHILE I STILL CAN.

562
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:09,416
Y'ALL SEE ANY CARAMEL APPLES?

563
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,217
>> WHY DO YOU NEED

564
00:14:10,217 --> 00:14:10,984
A CARAMEL APPLE?

565
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:12,019
>> BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN CRAVING

566
00:14:12,019 --> 00:14:13,153
THEM FOR MONTHS ON END.

567
00:14:13,153 --> 00:14:14,087
>> YOU SHOULD PROBABLY BUY

568
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:14,821
MORE THAN ONE.

569
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:20,060
>> YEAH, PROBABLY.

570
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,860
>> WE'RE GONNA GO

571
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:21,728
RIDE THIS REAL FAST.

572
00:14:21,728 --> 00:14:22,595
>> NOT THAT.

573
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:23,830
>> IT LOOKS PRETTY FUN.

574
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:25,732
>> LEIGH-ANN, GO BUY TICKETS.

575
00:14:25,732 --> 00:14:27,167
>> THEY WON'T LET YOU ON THAT

576
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:27,935
RIDE, WILL THEY?

577
00:14:27,935 --> 00:14:29,469
>> OH, NO, Y'ALL CAN RIDE.

578
00:14:29,469 --> 00:14:30,137
I'LL WAIT.

579
00:14:30,137 --> 00:14:31,138
>> WELL, WE'LL THINK ABOUT YOU

580
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:32,472
WHILE WE'RE UP THERE HAVING FUN.

581
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:35,842
[all screaming]

582
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:38,411
>> I WANT TO GO SO BAD.

583
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:40,313
THAT'D BE SO MUCH FUN.

584
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:42,449
YAY!

585
00:14:42,449 --> 00:14:43,183
DO YOU WANT TO

586
00:14:43,183 --> 00:14:44,017
SPLIT A FUNNEL CAKE?

587
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:44,851
>> OKAY, FUNNEL CAKE

588
00:14:44,851 --> 00:14:45,552
SOUNDS GOOD.

589
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:48,088
>> LET'S SPLIT A FUNNEL CAKE.

590
00:14:48,088 --> 00:14:49,489
>> THIS FUNNEL CAKE IS SO GOOD.

591
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:50,257
>> IT REALLY IS.

592
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:52,425
>> I HAVEN'T HAD ONE IN FOREVER.

593
00:14:52,425 --> 00:14:53,293
HAS RYAN HELPED WITH

594
00:14:53,293 --> 00:14:55,095
THE BABY SHOWER AND STUFF?

595
00:14:55,095 --> 00:14:55,828
>> OH, YEAH.

596
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:56,696
THAT'S WHAT HE'S DOING

597
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:57,764
RIGHT NOW.

598
00:14:57,764 --> 00:14:58,598
>> OH, THAT'S GOOD.

599
00:14:58,598 --> 00:14:59,332
>> I'M EXCITED.

600
00:14:59,332 --> 00:15:00,733
LIKE, YOU KNOW, IT'S KIND OF

601
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,734
LIKE A SURPRISE PARTY THAT I

602
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:02,970
KNOW ABOUT, SO I'M JUST LIKE,

603
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:04,037
OKAY, I'M READY.

604
00:15:04,037 --> 00:15:04,837
WHEN IS IT?

605
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:05,838
>> WHEN DO YOU GET TO SEE IT?

606
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:06,873
>> THE DAY OF THE SHOWER.

607
00:15:06,873 --> 00:15:07,540
>> REALLY?

608
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,208
>> YES.

609
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:09,809
>> LIKE, WHEN SHE ARRIVES.

610
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:11,044
>> OH, WOW.

611
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:12,245
>> I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD

612
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:14,547
TO MY BABY SHOWER.

613
00:15:14,547 --> 00:15:15,949
RYAN'S STEPMOM VOLUNTEERED TO

614
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,350
HOST IT AT THEIR HOUSE, SO I

615
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:20,887
HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO EXPECT.

616
00:15:20,887 --> 00:15:23,723
>> EVERYBODY RELAX, ENJOY.

617
00:15:23,723 --> 00:15:25,058
WE'RE GONNA BE DOING

618
00:15:25,058 --> 00:15:27,694
A BABY SHOWER FOR JAMIE.

619
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:29,196
HOW BIG IS HER BELLY?

620
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:30,563
>> I'M GONNA GUESS OR--

621
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:31,864
>> YOU HAVE TO GUESS, YEAH.

622
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:32,699
>> ARE WE GONNA HAVE

623
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:33,566
ENOUGH RIBBON?

624
00:15:33,566 --> 00:15:34,401
>> OH, WOW.

625
00:15:34,401 --> 00:15:39,906
[laughter]

626
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:41,608
DID SHE MOVE AGAIN?

627
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:42,275
OH, YEAH.

628
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,710
>> OH!

629
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,412
[indistinct chatter]

630
00:15:45,412 --> 00:15:47,747
>> MY BABY SHOWER IS PERFECT.

631
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:49,249
RYAN SEEMED REALLY HAPPY

632
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:51,384
AND SO RELAXED AROUND KIDS.

633
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:52,352
I'M STARTING TO BELIEVE

634
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:53,886
HIS PROMISE TO QUIT PARTYING

635
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,422
AND STAY OUT OF TROUBLE

636
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:56,423
WHICH IS GREAT, BECAUSE

637
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:57,724
THE ONLY OTHER GUY IN MY LIFE

638
00:15:57,724 --> 00:16:00,260
IS A NO-SHOW.

639
00:16:00,260 --> 00:16:01,761
>> SO YOUR DAD DIDN'T COME.

640
00:16:01,761 --> 00:16:02,595
>> YEAH.

641
00:16:02,595 --> 00:16:03,430
>> WE DIDN'T REALLY

642
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,164
THINK HE WOULD.

643
00:16:04,164 --> 00:16:05,265
>> STEPHANIE SAID SHE SAW HIM

644
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:07,000
LAST WEEK AT THE FAIR.

645
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:07,800
THEY COULDN'T HAVE

646
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,536
EVEN INVITED ME?

647
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:11,871
>> YEAH.

648
00:16:11,871 --> 00:16:12,772
THEY COULD HAVE.

649
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:13,740
>> COULD HAVE, SHOULD HAVE,

650
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:14,407
WOULD HAVE.

651
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:15,508
>> BUT...

652
00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:17,044
>> I'M BUMMED MY DAD

653
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:17,744
DIDN'T SHOW.

654
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:19,012
BUT EVERYONE WAS REALLY

655
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:20,347
GENEROUS, AND I THINK WE'LL HAVE

656
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:21,481
MOST OF WHAT WE'LL NEED

657
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:23,083
WHEN MIAH COMES.

658
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,317
AND I THINK WE HAVE DAYCARE

659
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:25,852
FIGURED OUT TOO.

660
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:26,753
MY HIGH SCHOOL IS REALLY

661
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:28,588
SUPPORTIVE OF PREGNANT TEENS.

662
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:29,556
THEY HAVE A DAYCARE

663
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:30,823
RIGHT ON CAMPUS.

664
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,624
SO WHEN I'M READY

665
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:32,692
TO COME BACK TO SCHOOL,

666
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:33,893
MIAH CAN COME WITH ME.

667
00:16:33,893 --> 00:16:34,894
>> SO AS SOON AS YOU GET BACK

668
00:16:34,894 --> 00:16:35,895
AFTER YOU'VE HAD THE BABY,

669
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:37,464
WE'LL REQUEST FOR A CAR SEAT

670
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:38,465
TO BE ON BOTH BUSES

671
00:16:38,465 --> 00:16:40,400
TO TAKE YOU FROM HOME TO HERE

672
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,434
AND FROM HERE

673
00:16:41,434 --> 00:16:42,569
BACK TO THE DAYCARE.

674
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:43,736
>> OKAY.

675
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:45,305
I DON'T LOVE THE IDEA OF PUTTING

676
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:46,606
MIAH ON A SCHOOL BUS, BUT

677
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:48,575
WE CAN'T PASS UP FREE DAYCARE.

678
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:50,243
AND WITHOUT A PLACE OF OUR OWN,

679
00:16:50,243 --> 00:16:51,611
WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH A PLAN

680
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,246
FOR RYAN TO STAY AT MY HOUSE.

681
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:54,081
>> HEY, MAMA.

682
00:16:54,081 --> 00:16:54,914
>> HEY, BABY.

683
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:56,516
>> WHAT'S GOING ON?

684
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:57,684
BUT RYAN AND MY MOM

685
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,052
DON'T REALLY GET ALONG.

686
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:01,088
>> WHAT ARE YOU GUYS THINKING

687
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:02,889
AS FAR AS...

688
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:03,756
>> HIM BEING--

689
00:17:03,756 --> 00:17:05,492
>> HIM BEING HERE

690
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:06,859
AFTER THE BABY'S BORN?

691
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:08,195
YOU KNOW, WE--

692
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:10,029
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT.

693
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:10,797
AND--

694
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:13,233
>> WHAT ABOUT THE FIRST MONTH

695
00:17:13,233 --> 00:17:15,034
OR A FEW WEEKS THAT HE STAYS

696
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,704
AND HELPS TAKE CARE OF THE BABY?

697
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,539
>> OBVIOUSLY, Y'ALL ARE NOT

698
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:20,840
GONNA BE SLEEPING IN THE SAME

699
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:23,243
ROOM UPSTAIRS IN YOUR BEDROOM.

700
00:17:23,243 --> 00:17:23,910
>> MOM.

701
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:25,212
>> NO, LET ME FINISH.

702
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:26,479
I THINK HE SHOULD BE HERE

703
00:17:26,479 --> 00:17:28,215
FOR THE RESPONSIBILITY PART

704
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:30,049
IN THAT BABY ROOM.

705
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,318
>> I DON'T LIKE IT, BUT--

706
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:32,185
>> YOU DON'T LIKE IT,

707
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:33,753
BUT THAT IS THE WAY IT IS.

708
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:35,855
RYAN, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

709
00:17:35,855 --> 00:17:37,324
>> I'LL TAKE HER WITH ME

710
00:17:37,324 --> 00:17:39,592
SOMETIMES AND JAMIE COULD COME

711
00:17:39,592 --> 00:17:40,727
OVER TO MY HOUSE DURING THE DAY.

712
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:41,828
>> YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA

713
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:43,062
TAKE MIAH?

714
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,264
>> I'M DEFINITELY

715
00:17:44,264 --> 00:17:45,465
GONNA TAKE MIAH.

716
00:17:45,465 --> 00:17:47,167
THERE'S NO SAY IN THAT

717
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:47,900
RIGHT THERE.

718
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,568
THAT'S--

719
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:49,402
>> MM, YOU THINK?

720
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:50,137
>> NO, I KNOW.

721
00:17:50,137 --> 00:17:50,837
>> YOU THINK.

722
00:17:50,837 --> 00:17:51,638
>> I KNOW.

723
00:17:51,638 --> 00:17:52,639
>> I GUESS WE'LL JUST HAVE TO

724
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,073
SEE HOW IT GOES.

725
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,075
>> WE'LL HAVE TO, I GUESS.

726
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,778
>> YES, WE WILL.

727
00:17:58,778 --> 00:18:00,180
>> RYAN AND MY MOM ARE TWO OF

728
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:03,250
THE MOST STUBBORN PEOPLE I KNOW.

729
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,651
AND NOW, I'M STUCK

730
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:06,453
RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THEM.

731
00:18:16,363 --> 00:18:17,497
>> EVER SINCE THE TALK

732
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:18,865
WITH MY MOM, RYAN HAS BEEN

733
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:20,200
KIND OF DISTANT.

734
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:20,867
HE MISSED

735
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,135
ANOTHER DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT.

736
00:18:22,135 --> 00:18:23,303
AND SOME NIGHTS, I CAN'T

737
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:24,504
GET A HOLD OF HIM AT ALL.

738
00:18:24,504 --> 00:18:25,505
>> HEY, THIS IS RYAN.

739
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:27,507
JUST LEAVE A SHORT MESSAGE.

740
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:28,608
>> HE SWEARS HE'S NOT OUT

741
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,677
PARTYING, AND HE BETTER NOT BE,

742
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:31,811
BECAUSE IT FEELS LIKE MIAH'S

743
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:33,346
ON HER WAY...

744
00:18:33,346 --> 00:18:34,181
TONIGHT.

745
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:35,648
MOM!

746
00:18:35,648 --> 00:18:37,617
I THINK IT'S TIME.

747
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,018
>> ALL RIGHT.

748
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:40,187
GET READY.

749
00:18:40,187 --> 00:18:41,421
>> I'M READY TO GO.

750
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:42,522
I'M JUST WAITING FOR RYAN

751
00:18:42,522 --> 00:18:44,357
TO ANSWER HIS FREAKING PHONE.

752
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:45,758
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO REACH RYAN

753
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:46,926
FOR THE LAST HOUR,

754
00:18:46,926 --> 00:18:48,195
BUT HE'S NOT PICKING UP.

755
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:49,696
HERE, CARLY, WILL YOU CALL HIM?

756
00:18:49,696 --> 00:18:50,597
>> YEAH.

757
00:18:50,597 --> 00:18:52,565
COME ON, RYAN.

758
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:55,001
>> HEY, CHASTITY, IT'S JAMIE.

759
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:56,035
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO CALL RYAN,

760
00:18:56,035 --> 00:18:57,370
BUT HE'S NOT ANSWERING.

761
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,371
I'M GONNA KEEP CALLING HIM.

762
00:18:58,371 --> 00:18:59,739
BUT WILL YOU PLEASE TRY

763
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:02,141
AND GET HIM TO CALL ME, PLEASE?

764
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:02,809
THANK YOU.

765
00:19:02,809 --> 00:19:03,810
BYE.

766
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:05,578
I FEEL LIKE I HAVE TO PEE

767
00:19:05,578 --> 00:19:07,380
AND [bleep] AT THE SAME TIME.

768
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:08,080
>> OH, GROSS.

769
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:08,881
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE

770
00:19:08,881 --> 00:19:09,749
THIS IS HAPPENING.

771
00:19:09,749 --> 00:19:10,950
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS

772
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:12,719
MOMENT FOR NINE MONTHS,

773
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:14,721
AND NOW THAT IT'S HERE,

774
00:19:14,721 --> 00:19:16,523
RYAN IS TOTALLY M.I.A.

775
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:24,897
MY CONTRACTIONS ARE KILLING ME.

776
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,399
EVERYONE IS TRYING THEIR BEST

777
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:27,600
TO MAKE ME COMFORTABLE,

778
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,568
BUT THE FACT THAT

779
00:19:28,568 --> 00:19:30,136
RYAN STILL HASN'T CALLED

780
00:19:30,136 --> 00:19:32,071
JUST MAKES ME MORE MISERABLE.

781
00:19:32,071 --> 00:19:33,172
>> SO JAMIE, WHO ALL'S GONNA BE

782
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,173
IN THE ROOM WITH YOU

783
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,743
WHEN YOU DELIVER?

784
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:37,744
>> I DON'T KNOW.

785
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:39,078
>> YOU DON'T KNOW?

786
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:40,680
>> RYAN, IF WE CAN

787
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:44,684
GET A HOLD OF HIM.

788
00:19:44,684 --> 00:19:46,719
>> LUCKILY, I'M DILATED ENOUGH

789
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:47,787
TO GET AN EPIDURAL

790
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,021
TO HELP NUMB THE PAIN.

791
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,089
BUT IT'S TAKING A WHILE

792
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:51,991
TO KICK IN.

793
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:00,567
FIVE HOURS INTO LABOR,

794
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:02,669
RYAN FINALLY SHOWS UP

795
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:03,503
LOOKING LIKE HELL

796
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:05,305
AND WITH A PATHETIC EXCUSE.

797
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:19,386
YOU SMELL LIKE YOU HAD FUN.

798
00:20:19,386 --> 00:20:23,055
>> WHY IS THAT?

799
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,156
>> I DON'T THINK I NEED TO SAY

800
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:28,728
THAT RIGHT NOW.

801
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:29,896
I'M SO PISSED

802
00:20:29,896 --> 00:20:31,431
THAT RYAN WAS OUT PARTYING.

803
00:20:31,431 --> 00:20:33,466
BUT THERE'S NO TIME TO ARGUE NOW

804
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:34,534
BECAUSE I'M READY TO START

805
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:35,234
PUSHING.

806
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:36,135
>> NEXT TIME YOU HAVE A

807
00:20:36,135 --> 00:20:37,203
CONTRACTION, WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO

808
00:20:37,203 --> 00:20:38,305
IS, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TWO PEOPLE

809
00:20:38,305 --> 00:20:39,339
HELPING HOLD YOUR LEGS.

810
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:40,072
NOW PUSH DOWN.

811
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:40,840
>> AND PUSH LIKE

812
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:41,708
YOU'RE TRYING TO POOP.

813
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:42,409
GO, GO, GO.

814
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:43,075
>> PERFECT.

815
00:20:43,075 --> 00:20:43,643
FOUR,

816
00:20:43,643 --> 00:20:44,210
FIVE,

817
00:20:44,210 --> 00:20:45,211

NINE,

821
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,548
AND TEN.

822
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:49,215
GOOD.

823
00:20:49,215 --> 00:20:50,350
>> both: ONE LAST TIME, OKAY?

824
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,518
>> KEEP BREATHING.

825
00:20:51,518 --> 00:20:52,552
>> AND GO.

826
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:53,219
ONE,

827
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:54,020
>> YOU CAN DO THIS.

828
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:54,621
>> TWO,

829
00:20:54,621 --> 00:20:55,288
THREE,

830
00:20:55,288 --> 00:20:56,289
FOUR,

831
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:57,023
FIVE,

NINE

836
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:01,027
TEN. GOOD.

837
00:21:01,027 --> 00:21:01,961
DEEP BREATH.

838
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:02,629
>> [sighs]

839
00:21:02,629 --> 00:21:03,730
>> JUST RELAX.

840
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,531
>> YOU DID GREAT.

841
00:21:04,531 --> 00:21:05,264
>> IS IT NORMAL

842
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:06,232
TO FEEL NAUSEOUS?

843
00:21:06,232 --> 00:21:09,402
>> both: YES.

844
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:10,703
[retches]

845
00:21:10,703 --> 00:21:13,540
>> OH, I'M SORRY.

846
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:15,207
>> ALL RIGHT.

847
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:17,844
[retches]

848
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,255
>> IF THE HEART RATE DIPS TOO

849
00:21:29,255 --> 00:21:30,823
MUCH, WE'LL HAVE TO MAYBE

850
00:21:30,823 --> 00:21:32,825
INTERVENE AND HELP YOU HAVE

851
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:34,193
YOUR BABY FASTER USING SOMETHING

852
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:35,161
CALLED FORCEPS.

853
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:36,396
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF FORCEPS?

854
00:21:36,396 --> 00:21:37,464
>> THEY'RE THE, LIKE,

855
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:38,565
PLIER THINGS, RIGHT?

856
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:39,532
>> THEY'RE METAL,

857
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:40,600
AND THEY GO KIND OF BESIDE

858
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:44,504
THE BABY AND THEY HELP SORT OF

859
00:21:44,504 --> 00:21:45,338
GUIDE THE BABY OUT.

860
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:48,675
[indistinct chatter]

861
00:21:48,675 --> 00:21:50,410
>> YOU'RE GONNA BE FINE.

862
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,378
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS

863
00:21:51,378 --> 00:21:52,144
ABOUT ALL THIS?

864
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,647
>> UM, KIND OF--I DON'T--

865
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:58,518
I'M NOT SURE.

866
00:21:58,518 --> 00:22:00,052
OKAY.

867
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:00,720
OH, MAN.

868
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,621
>> MOVE YOUR GOWN UP

869
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:03,055
SO I CAN GET TO YOUR BELLY.

870
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,023
>> HEY, JAMIE,

871
00:22:04,023 --> 00:22:04,991
THOSE ARE VERY NORMAL.

872
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:09,362
IT'S OKAY.

873
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:11,030
>> OKAY.

874
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:11,864
>> ALL RIGHT,

875
00:22:11,864 --> 00:22:12,832
SO YOU HAVE A CONTRACTION.

876
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,000
OKAY, TAKE A DEEP BREATH,

877
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,868
PULL YOUR LEGS BACK,

00:22:15,868 --> 00:22:18,037
AND PUSH, PUSH, BREATHE.

879
00:22:18,037 --> 00:22:19,205

00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:25,344
TEN.

886
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,312
TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND PUSH

887
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:27,580
ANOTHER TIME FOR A BODY.

888
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,881
>> AND LOOK AT MOMMY.

889
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:31,217
>> OH, LOOK!

890
00:22:31,217 --> 00:22:32,051
>> PUSH A LITTLE BIT.

891
00:22:32,051 --> 00:22:33,052
>> PUSH, BABY, PUSH.

892
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:33,886
>> THERE WE GO.

898
00:22:41,260 --> 00:22:44,030
LOOK AT YOUR BABY MIAH.

>> [laughs feebly]

900
00:22:45,665 --> 00:22:47,467
SHE'S SO CUTE.

901
00:22:59,846 --> 00:23:01,213
AFTER MIAH WAS BORN,

902
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:02,849
I TOLD RYAN TO GO HOME.

903
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:03,783
HE WANTED TO STAY AT

904
00:23:03,783 --> 00:23:05,151
THE HOSPITAL, BUT AFTER

905
00:23:05,151 --> 00:23:06,318
NOT SHOWING UP FOR ME

906
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:07,954
BECAUSE HE WAS OUT PARTYING,

907
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:12,859
I CAN'T BELIEVE A WORD HE SAYS.

908
00:23:12,859 --> 00:23:13,960
WAS THAT A POOPIE

909
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,529
OR WAS THAT A FART?

910
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:18,531
WE'LL HAVE TO FIND OUT.

911
00:23:18,531 --> 00:23:20,700
OH, SHE'S CRYING.

912
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,702
OH, YEAH, THAT'S A POOP.

913
00:23:22,702 --> 00:23:23,369
YEAH.

914
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:26,105
[baby wailing]

915
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:27,674
MIAH IS A NICE DISTRACTION

916
00:23:27,674 --> 00:23:29,576
FROM ALL THE DRAMA WITH RYAN.

917
00:23:29,576 --> 00:23:31,444
AND I HAVE SOME VISITORS TOO,

918
00:23:31,444 --> 00:23:33,480
ONE OF WHICH IS A HUGE SURPRISE.

919
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,047
HEY, DAD.

920
00:23:35,047 --> 00:23:36,382
WHAT'S GOING ON?

921
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:37,316
>> NOT MUCH.

922
00:23:37,316 --> 00:23:38,317
GOT YOU SOME FLOWERS.

923
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:39,619
>> OH, THEY'RE PRETTY.

924
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:40,453
>> HOW YOU FEELING?

925
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:41,320
I'M GOOD.

926
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,523
>> I'M GLAD YOU'RE FEELING GOOD.

927
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:46,158
SHE'S A CUTIE.

928
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,560
>> YOU WANT TO HOLD HER?

929
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:50,530
>> SURE.

930
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,665
OH, COME TO GRAMPY.

931
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:53,500
GRAMPY.

932
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,334
>> GRAMPY.

933
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:56,836
IF YOU WANT TO BE GRAMPY.

934
00:23:56,836 --> 00:23:58,705
>> OH, YOU WANT TO CRY ON ME?

935
00:23:58,705 --> 00:24:00,439
>> [laughs]

936
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,207
>> OH, WONDERFUL.

937
00:24:01,207 --> 00:24:02,542
>> EVEN THOUGH HE SKIPPED MY

938
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:04,310
BABY SHOWER, I'M HAPPY MY DAD

939
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:06,012
CAME TO SEE ME IN THE HOSPITAL.

940
00:24:06,012 --> 00:24:07,446
HOPEFULLY HE'LL BE AROUND MORE

941
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:11,684
NOW THAT MIAH'S HERE.

942
00:24:11,684 --> 00:24:13,986
IT'S TIME TO TAKE MIAH HOME.

943
00:24:13,986 --> 00:24:15,321
I ALWAYS THOUGHT RYAN WOULD BE

944
00:24:15,321 --> 00:24:16,923
COMING HOME WITH US, BUT I GUESS

945
00:24:16,923 --> 00:24:18,157
I'D BETTER GET USED TO

946
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:19,692
DOING THINGS ON MY OWN.

947
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:20,593
>> I'M READY TO BE HOME,

948
00:24:20,593 --> 00:24:21,293
AREN'T YOU?

949
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:21,961
>> ME TOO.

950
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:27,534
>> YEAH.

951
00:24:27,534 --> 00:24:28,367
>> LET ME CHECK

952
00:24:28,367 --> 00:24:29,736
THE LAST TIME I FED YOU.

953
00:24:29,736 --> 00:24:32,539
6:00.

954
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:36,108
OKAY, YEAH, I NEED TO FEED HER.

955
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:41,981
DOING A GOOD JOB.

956
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,449
IT'S MY SECOND DAY HOME FROM THE

957
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:45,552
HOSPITAL, AND RYAN HASN'T CALLED

958
00:24:45,552 --> 00:24:46,986
'CAUSE HE KNOWS I'M PISSED.

959
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:48,354
BUT HE STILL SHOWED UP WITH A

960
00:24:48,354 --> 00:24:49,756
CHANGE OF CLOTHES EXPECTING TO

961
00:24:49,756 --> 00:24:51,323
SLEEP IN THE BABY'S ROOM.

962
00:24:51,323 --> 00:24:52,759
I'M WILLING TO SUCK IT UP FOR

963
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:54,326
MIAH'S SAKE, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE

964
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,728
HE'S BEEN PARTYING NONSTOP,

965
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:56,663
AND I CAN BARELY

966
00:24:56,663 --> 00:24:57,830
STAND THE SIGHT OF HIM.

967
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,699
I'M GONNA TELL YOU,

968
00:24:59,699 --> 00:25:00,933
MOM'S NOT TOO THRILLED

969
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:02,501
ABOUT YOU BEING HERE.

970
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,570
>> I MEAN, IF I COULD BREASTFEED

971
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:04,837
HER, I'D JUST TAKE HER HOME

972
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,674
AND HAVE MY TIME ALONE WITH HER.

973
00:25:07,674 --> 00:25:09,341
>> YOU'RE NOT GONNA TAKE HER,

974
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,342
RYAN.

975
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:11,110
>> I'M NOT GONNA

976
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:11,911
TAKE MY DAUGHTER?

977
00:25:11,911 --> 00:25:13,012
SHE CAN'T STAY WITH ME?

978
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:13,780
>> NOT RIGHT NOW.

979
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:14,847
>> WITH MY FAMILY?

980
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:16,515
>> NOT RIGHT NOW.

981
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,450
>> WOW.

982
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:19,919
>> I KIND OF HAVE TO FEED HER.

983
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:24,691
IF YOU'LL HAND ME THAT BOPPY.

984
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:25,892
>> YOU'RE NOT JUST HURTING ME

985
00:25:25,892 --> 00:25:27,359
BY KEEPING HER FROM COMING

986
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:29,161
AND STAYING WITH ME.

987
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:30,162
>> I'M TRYING TO WORK IT OUT,

988
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:31,130
OKAY, JUST LET ME

989
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:33,199
DO THE BEST I CAN, OKAY?

990
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:34,066
>> THAT'S MY DAUGHTER.

991
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:35,434
YOU CAN SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT.

992
00:25:35,434 --> 00:25:36,669
YOU CAN NEVER ALLOW ME BACK IN

993
00:25:36,669 --> 00:25:38,738
YOUR HOUSE, BUT I JUST DON'T SEE

994
00:25:38,738 --> 00:25:39,706
WHAT ELSE--

995
00:25:39,706 --> 00:25:40,640
>> I CANNOT GUARANTEE YOU

996
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:41,908
SOMETHING RIGHT NOW.

997
00:25:41,908 --> 00:25:42,842
>> YOU CAN'T GUARANTEE ME

998
00:25:42,842 --> 00:25:44,010
THAT I GET TO SEE MY DAUGHTER?

999
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:44,811
>> YOU PUT YOURSELF

1000
00:25:44,811 --> 00:25:45,745
IN THIS POSITION.

1001
00:25:45,745 --> 00:25:46,679
IF YOU HADN'T HAVE DONE...

1002
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:47,847
>> OKAY, JAMIE--

1003
00:25:47,847 --> 00:25:48,815
>> EVERYTHING YOU'VE DONE IN

1004
00:25:48,815 --> 00:25:49,849
THE PAST NINE FREAKING MONTHS,

1005
00:25:49,849 --> 00:25:51,483
THEN MAYBE MAYBE WE WOULD BE

1006
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:52,652
TOGETHER AND MAYBE YOU WOULDN'T

1007
00:25:52,652 --> 00:25:53,720
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THAT,

1008
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:54,821
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

1009
00:25:54,821 --> 00:25:56,989
YOU DID.

1010
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:57,957
YOU MADE YOUR BED;

1011
00:25:57,957 --> 00:25:59,158
NOW YOU HAVE TO LIE IN IT.

1012
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:00,827
>> YO, I'LL TRY TO BE A GOOD

1013
00:26:00,827 --> 00:26:02,428
FATHER AND BE HERE FOR MY CHILD.

1014
00:26:02,428 --> 00:26:03,395
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO DO THAT

1015
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,731
WHEN I CAN'T BE HERE AND

1016
00:26:04,731 --> 00:26:06,599
I CAN'T TAKE HER HOME WITH ME?

1017
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:08,267
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

1018
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:10,102
IT'S ALL I ASK FOR.

1019
00:26:10,102 --> 00:26:11,938
I JUST WANT TO BE ABLE

1020
00:26:11,938 --> 00:26:13,105
TO BE WITH MY CHILD.

1021
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:14,306
I DON'T HAVE TO BE HERE

1022
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:15,007
TO DO THAT.

1023
00:26:15,007 --> 00:26:15,875
>> I'M NOT TAKING HER

1024
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:18,945
AWAY FROM YOU.

1025
00:26:18,945 --> 00:26:19,646
YOU'RE JUST

1026
00:26:19,646 --> 00:26:21,180
JUMPING TO CONCLUSIONS.

1027
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,615
>> CAN I HOLD HER FOR A WHILE?

1028
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:24,183
THEN I'LL LEAVE.

1029
00:26:24,183 --> 00:26:27,854
PLEASE.

1030
00:26:27,854 --> 00:26:32,324
[both sniffling]

1031
00:26:32,324 --> 00:26:33,693
>> SO WHAT DID I JUST WALK INTO?

1032
00:26:33,693 --> 00:26:34,694
>> I JUST--

1033
00:26:34,694 --> 00:26:35,862
I WAS JUST WONDERING

1034
00:26:35,862 --> 00:26:37,029
WHEN AND IF

1035
00:26:37,029 --> 00:26:37,697
[sobbing]

1036
00:26:37,697 --> 00:26:40,299
I WOULD BE ABLE TO

1037
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:43,235
HAVE MY DAUGHTER AT MY HOUSE

1038
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:44,103
WITH ME.

1039
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:44,971
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW

1040
00:26:44,971 --> 00:26:46,105
WHEN THAT'S GONNA BE BECAUSE

1041
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:47,807
RIGHT NOW SHE'S A NEWBORN.

1042
00:26:47,807 --> 00:26:49,642
AND RIGHT NOW, SHE HAS TO BE FED

1043
00:26:49,642 --> 00:26:51,243
BY HER MOTHER, PERIOD.

1044
00:26:51,243 --> 00:26:51,911
>> I KNOW,

1045
00:26:51,911 --> 00:26:53,145
BUT YOU CAN ALWAYS PUMP

1046
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:55,381
AND GIVE ENOUGH TO ME

1047
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:56,315
TO FEED HER.

1048
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:57,149
>> HEY, RYAN.

1049
00:26:57,149 --> 00:26:58,584
RYAN.

1050
00:26:58,584 --> 00:27:00,653
RIGHT NOW, IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU.

1051
00:27:00,653 --> 00:27:01,921
RIGHT NOW, IT'S ABOUT MIAH.

1052
00:27:01,921 --> 00:27:03,155
AND YOUR DAUGHTER IS RIGHT WHERE

1053
00:27:03,155 --> 00:27:04,323
SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE RIGHT WITH

1054
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:05,892
HER MOTHER.

1055
00:27:05,892 --> 00:27:07,159
>> BUT IT'S HARD, SO YOU JUST

1056
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:08,895
HAVE TO GO WITH IT.

1057
00:27:08,895 --> 00:27:09,595
>> IT'S HARD

1058
00:27:09,595 --> 00:27:10,529
BECAUSE YOU DAMN HURT HER.

1059
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:11,330
>> THIS--

1060
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:12,298
>> SHUT UP.

1061
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:13,465
YOU SHUT UP A MINUTE.

1062
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:14,133
>> [sighs]

1063
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:15,401
>> WE HAD A PLAN.

1064
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:17,336
EVERYTHING WAS FINE, WASN'T IT?

1065
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:18,504
AND YOU TOTALLY FRIGGIN'

1066
00:27:18,504 --> 00:27:19,906
BLEW THAT.

1067
00:27:19,906 --> 00:27:21,273
YOU'RE LUCKY YOU EVEN MADE IT

1068
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:24,176
TO THE DAMN BIRTH.

1069
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:24,944
YOU'RE NOT EVEN

1070
00:27:24,944 --> 00:27:26,012
OLD ENOUGH TO DRINK,

1071
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:27,747
AND YOU SHOW UP HUNG OVER.

1072
00:27:27,747 --> 00:27:29,281
AND RIGHT NOW, I'M REALLY

1073
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:31,250
PISSED OFF AT YOU BECAUSE

1074
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,185
YOU'RE NOT RESPONSIBLE.

1075
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:34,220
BUT WE'LL JUST HAVE TO

1076
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,221
FIGURE OUT A DIFFERENT WAY

1077
00:27:35,221 --> 00:27:37,023
THAN WHAT WE HAD PLANNED.

1078
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:44,496
>> ALL I EVER WANTED FOR MIAH

1079
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:45,965
IS WHAT I NEVER HAD:

1080
00:27:45,965 --> 00:27:47,900
TWO PARENTS IN HER LIFE.

1081
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,201
BUT IT'S OBVIOUS THAT RYAN

1082
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:50,636
HASN'T CHANGED A BIT,

1083
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:51,904
AND I JUST CAN'T TRUST HIM

1084
00:27:51,904 --> 00:27:53,740
TO BE ALONE WITH MIAH.

1085
00:28:02,915 --> 00:28:04,483
>> SINCE RYAN'S BREAKDOWN OVER

1086
00:28:04,483 --> 00:28:06,152
MIAH, HE'S CONTINUED TO ASK

1087
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:07,887
ABOUT TAKING HER TO HIS HOUSE,

1088
00:28:07,887 --> 00:28:10,089
AND I'VE CONTINUED TO SAY NO.

1089
00:28:10,089 --> 00:28:11,523
I'VE GOT TOO MUCH ON MY MIND TO

1090
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,658
THINK ABOUT SENDING HER AWAY

1091
00:28:12,658 --> 00:28:13,325
WITH HIM.

1092
00:28:13,325 --> 00:28:14,994
IS THIS FOUR WEEKS' WORTH?

1093
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:15,661
>> YEAH.

1094
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:16,362
>> IS THAT--

1095
00:28:16,362 --> 00:28:17,930
>> OH, MY GOSH.

1096
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:18,597
YEAH.

1097
00:28:18,597 --> 00:28:19,665
I'LL BE OUT OF SCHOOL FOR A

1098
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:21,533
WHILE, BUT I CAN'T AFFORD TO

1099
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,002
FALL BEHIND, SO MY TEACHERS

1100
00:28:23,002 --> 00:28:24,003
SENT ME THE ASSIGNMENTS

1101
00:28:24,003 --> 00:28:25,104
FOR THE NEXT MONTH.

1102
00:28:25,104 --> 00:28:28,274
I'M GLAD I GOT A BIGGER BINDER.

1103
00:28:28,274 --> 00:28:31,143
[baby wailing]

1104
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:32,812
HELLO.

1105
00:28:32,812 --> 00:28:34,781
SO FAR, THERE HASN'T BEEN MUCH

1106
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:36,015
TIME FOR SCHOOLWORK.

1107
00:28:36,015 --> 00:28:36,783
IT'S OKAY.

1108
00:28:36,783 --> 00:28:38,117
[baby wailing]

1109
00:28:38,117 --> 00:28:39,986
IT'S OKAY.

1110
00:28:39,986 --> 00:28:40,686
OOH!

1111
00:28:40,686 --> 00:28:42,054
LOOKING AFTER MIAH TAKES UP

1112
00:28:42,054 --> 00:28:44,223
EVERY MINUTE OF MY DAY,

1113
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,224
AND RYAN NEVER COMES OVER

1114
00:28:45,224 --> 00:28:46,258
TO HELP.

1115
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:48,227
HE JUST CALLS FOR ONE THING.

1116
00:28:48,227 --> 00:28:49,628
HELLO.

1117
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:51,630
>> WHAT'S UP?

1118
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:53,432
>> TAKING CARE OF MIAH.

1119
00:28:58,805 --> 00:29:00,606
WITH ME WITH YOU.

1120
00:29:04,143 --> 00:29:05,812
RYAN.

1121
00:29:05,812 --> 00:29:06,913
SHE'S TOO YOUNG

1122
00:29:06,913 --> 00:29:08,480
TO BE AWAY FROM ME, ONE.

1123
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,349
TWO, I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MILK.

1124
00:29:15,221 --> 00:29:17,189
HAVE A GOOD DAY, RYAN.

1125
00:29:17,189 --> 00:29:19,591
BYE.

1126
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:20,827
I WISH RYAN WOULD JUST

1127
00:29:20,827 --> 00:29:21,861
COME OVER AND SPEND TIME

1128
00:29:21,861 --> 00:29:22,929
WITH HIS DAUGHTER.

1129
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:24,130
BUT HE SAYS MY MOM

1130
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,364
MAKES HIM UNCOMFORTABLE.

1131
00:29:25,364 --> 00:29:26,665
AND HE'D RATHER SEE MIAH

1132
00:29:26,665 --> 00:29:29,268
AT HIS HOUSE.

1133
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:30,369
>> IS RYAN STILL BUGGING YOU

1134
00:29:30,369 --> 00:29:31,971
ABOUT WHEN HE'S GONNA GET TO

1135
00:29:31,971 --> 00:29:33,105
KEEP HER OVERNIGHT?

1136
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:33,906
>> YEAH.

1137
00:29:33,906 --> 00:29:35,641
BUT RYAN IS THE FATHER.

1138
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:36,876
HE STILL HAS PARENTAL RIGHTS.

1139
00:29:36,876 --> 00:29:38,110
YOU NEED TO THINK ABOUT THAT.

1140
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,411
>> HIS NAME IS NOT EVEN

1141
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:40,712
ON THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE

1142
00:29:40,712 --> 00:29:41,447
AT THIS POINT.

1143
00:29:41,447 --> 00:29:42,614
SO RIGHT NOW, HE DOESN'T--

1144
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:45,617
LEGALLY, HE HAS ZILCHO RIGHTS.

1145
00:29:45,617 --> 00:29:47,653
IT WOULD TOTALLY BE A LOT

1146
00:29:47,653 --> 00:29:48,520
DIFFERENT, JAMIE,

1147
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:49,521
IF HE HADN'T SPUN ME

1148
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:50,456
ALL THAT [bleep] HE WAS--

1149
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:52,358
HE LOVED YOU AND HE LOVED MIAH

1150
00:29:52,358 --> 00:29:53,325
AND HE WAS GONNA BE THERE.

1151
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:54,526
AND ALONG BEHIND THE SCENES,

1152
00:29:54,526 --> 00:29:55,294
HE'S BEEN DOING

1153
00:29:55,294 --> 00:29:57,296
GOD ONLY KNOWS WHAT.

1154
00:29:57,296 --> 00:29:58,730
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

1155
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,666
>> HE HURT MY DAUGHTER.

1156
00:30:00,666 --> 00:30:01,333
>> ME.

1157
00:30:01,333 --> 00:30:02,001
>> YEAH.

1158
00:30:02,001 --> 00:30:02,935
>> AND I'M TAKING IT A LOT

1159
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:03,702
BETTER THAN YOU.

1160
00:30:03,702 --> 00:30:04,636
>> I KNOW, BUT I'M A MOM,

1161
00:30:04,636 --> 00:30:05,437
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

1162
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:06,338
WHEN SOMEONE HURTS YOUR

1163
00:30:06,338 --> 00:30:07,306
DAUGHTER, YOU'RE GONNA KNOW

1164
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:10,609
EXACTLY HOW I FEEL.

1165
00:30:10,609 --> 00:30:11,978
>> I JUST WANT TO FORGET THOUGH.

1166
00:30:11,978 --> 00:30:12,778
>> I KNOW YOU DO.

1167
00:30:12,778 --> 00:30:14,513
AND YOU CAN'T.

1168
00:30:21,353 --> 00:30:22,221
>> I GET WHERE MY MOM

1169
00:30:22,221 --> 00:30:23,622
IS COMING FROM, BUT NO MATTER

1170
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:25,091
HOW I FEEL ABOUT RYAN,

1171
00:30:25,091 --> 00:30:27,093
I STILL WANT HIM IN MIAH'S LIFE.

1172
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:28,327
HE LEFT ME A MESSAGE SAYING

1173
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:29,761
HE JUST GOT HIS LICENSE BACK,

1174
00:30:29,761 --> 00:30:31,363
AND HE WANTS ME AND MIAH

1175
00:30:31,363 --> 00:30:32,764
TO COME TO A HALLOWEEN PARTY

1176
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:34,433
AT HIS PARENTS' HOUSE.

1177
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:35,467
MY MOM DOESN'T THINK

1178
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:36,435
IT'S A GOOD IDEA,

1179
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:37,937
BUT I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD GO.

1180
00:30:37,937 --> 00:30:39,105
HI.

1181
00:30:39,105 --> 00:30:41,007
>> WHAT TIME DO YOU WANT ME TO

1182
00:30:41,007 --> 00:30:41,773
COME PICK YOU UP?

1183
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:42,641
>> I'LL BE DOWN THERE

1184
00:30:42,641 --> 00:30:45,544
IN A SECOND.

1185
00:30:45,544 --> 00:30:49,949
YOU CAN TAKE HER OUT.

1186
00:30:49,949 --> 00:30:52,318
>> DO NOT GET IN THE CAR WITH

1187
00:30:52,318 --> 00:30:53,319
ANYBODY THAT'S BEEN DRINKING.

1188
00:30:53,319 --> 00:30:54,286
>> I KNOW.

1189
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:54,954
LOVE YOU.

1190
00:30:54,954 --> 00:30:56,855
>> ALL RIGHT, LOVE YOU TOO.

1191
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,958
>> SO WHAT'S UP?

1192
00:30:58,958 --> 00:30:59,791
>> NOTHING.

1193
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:02,661
I'M HAVING AN AWESOME DAY.

1194
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:03,963
>> NOW THAT YOU'RE

1195
00:31:03,963 --> 00:31:06,698
STUCK IN THE CAR WITH ME,

1196
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,301
OBVIOUSLY, YOU DON'T CARE--

1197
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:10,702
>> I LOVE HOW YOU WANT TO FIGHT

1198
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:11,403
WITH ME.

1199
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:12,571
>> NO, YOU'RE STUCK.

1200
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:14,406
>> NO, BUT I CAN GOING TO HOME.

1201
00:31:14,406 --> 00:31:15,474
I CAN GET TO YOUR HOUSE

1202
00:31:15,474 --> 00:31:16,142
AND LEAVE.

1203
00:31:16,142 --> 00:31:16,943
>> I'M NOT TRYING,

1204
00:31:16,943 --> 00:31:17,876
BUT MIAH'S COMING WITH ME.

1205
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:18,978
>> SO THEN DON'T FIGHT WITH ME.

1206
00:31:18,978 --> 00:31:19,511
NO.

1207
00:31:19,511 --> 00:31:20,312
>> I'M NOT FIGHTING

1208
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:21,113
RIGHT NOW THOUGH.

1209
00:31:21,113 --> 00:31:21,981
I'M JUST TELLING YOU--

1210
00:31:21,981 --> 00:31:22,982
>> YOUR NAME ISN'T EVEN ON THE

1211
00:31:22,982 --> 00:31:23,950
BIRTH CERTIFICATE, SO IF YOU

1212
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:24,883
WANT TO TRY AND TAKE HER,

1213
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:25,884
I CAN GET YOU FOR KIDNAPPING.

1214
00:31:25,884 --> 00:31:26,785
SO DON'T EVEN TRY THAT.

1215
00:31:26,785 --> 00:31:27,719
>> OKAY, YOU'D BE A BITCH

1216
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:28,454
FOR DOING THAT.

1217
00:31:28,454 --> 00:31:29,621
I COULD SEE YOUR MOM DOING THAT

1218
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:30,923
IF YOUR MOM WAS YOU.

1219
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:32,558
SO HOPE YOU'RE NOT GONNA

1220
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:33,659
BE LIKE YOUR MOM.

1221
00:31:33,659 --> 00:31:34,626
>> YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO

1222
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:36,929
BE LIKE THAT, AND YEAH,

1223
00:31:36,929 --> 00:31:41,167
IT COULD GET UGLY.

1224
00:31:41,167 --> 00:31:44,603
HELLO.

1225
00:31:44,603 --> 00:31:46,638
>> HI, GORGEOUS.

1226
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:48,941
AWW.

1227
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:50,142
MIAH.

1228
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:51,777
>> SAY HELLO.

1229
00:31:51,777 --> 00:31:53,545
RYAN'S ATTITUDE IN THE CAR MADE

1230
00:31:53,545 --> 00:31:55,114
ME REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE,

1231
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:56,782
AND HIM INSISTING HE TAKE MIAH

1232
00:31:56,782 --> 00:31:58,350
ON HIS OWN IS REALLY

1233
00:31:58,350 --> 00:31:59,218
GETTING ON MY NERVES.

1234
00:31:59,218 --> 00:32:00,486
>> ARE YOU GONNA LET ME

1235
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:01,853
HAVE HER TOMORROW?

1236
00:32:01,853 --> 00:32:04,856
>> SHE'S TOO YOUNG, RYAN.

1237
00:32:04,856 --> 00:32:05,624
>> OH, MY GOD.

1238
00:32:05,624 --> 00:32:06,558
HERE WE GO AGAIN.

1239
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:07,793
WHEN IS SHE GONNA BE OLD ENOUGH?

1240
00:32:07,793 --> 00:32:10,796
>> I DON'T KNOW, RYAN.

1241
00:32:10,796 --> 00:32:12,531
>> WHETHER MAMA LIKES IT OR NOT,

1242
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:14,233
IT'S GONNA BE SOON.

1243
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:15,567
>> DON'T WANT TO HEAR THIS.

1244
00:32:15,567 --> 00:32:16,402
I DO NOT WANT TO

1245
00:32:16,402 --> 00:32:17,736
FIGHT WITH YOU TODAY.

1246
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:18,770
>> LET ME SEE MY DAUGHTER,

1247
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:21,073
THERE WOULDN'T BE NO FIGHTING.

1248
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:21,907
WILL YOU HOLD HER?

1249
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:23,042
I'M GONNA GO TALK TO HER

1250
00:32:23,042 --> 00:32:26,678
FOR A SECOND AND APOLOGIZE.

1251
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:27,980
BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

1252
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:29,415
WHY I'M GETTING SO AGITATED

1253
00:32:29,415 --> 00:32:30,082
ABOUT IT.

1254
00:32:30,082 --> 00:32:30,916
I JUST WANT TIME

1255
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:31,717
WITH MY DAUGHTER.

1256
00:32:31,717 --> 00:32:32,618
>> AND YOU WILL GET TIME

1257
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:33,252
WITH HER.

1258
00:32:33,252 --> 00:32:35,421
YOU HAVE SO MANY YEARS LEFT.

1259
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:36,222
>> YEAH, BUT I JUST

1260
00:32:36,222 --> 00:32:36,955
WANT HER NOW.

1261
00:32:36,955 --> 00:32:37,956
>> IT'S NOT LIKE I'M TRYING TO

1262
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:38,824
KEEP YOU AWAY FROM HER.

1263
00:32:38,824 --> 00:32:39,791
>> I JUST WANT TO KNOW WHEN.

1264
00:32:39,791 --> 00:32:40,759
YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL

1265
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:42,328
ABOUT COMING OVER NOW.

1266
00:32:42,328 --> 00:32:43,429
I'M NOT GONNA ALWAYS WANT TO GO

1267
00:32:43,429 --> 00:32:44,563
OVER THERE, AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA

1268
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:46,265
ALWAYS WANT TO COME OVER HERE.

1269
00:32:46,265 --> 00:32:47,433
SO IT WOULD JUST BE EASIER

1270
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:49,035
ON EVERYONE IF SHE JUST

1271
00:32:49,035 --> 00:32:50,436
WENT WITH ME.

1272
00:32:50,436 --> 00:32:51,403
>> WELL, MY SISTER'S

1273
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:53,205
ABOUT TO COME GET ME.

1274
00:32:57,109 --> 00:33:01,980
IT'S OKAY.

1275
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,782
MY MOM IS RIGHT.

1276
00:33:03,782 --> 00:33:04,550
BEING AROUND RYAN

1277
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:06,618
IS JUST TOO STRESSFUL.

1278
00:33:06,618 --> 00:33:07,953
I DON'T WANT TO KEEP RYAN

1279
00:33:07,953 --> 00:33:08,954
AWAY FROM HIS DAUGHTER,

1280
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:10,222
BUT THAT MIGHT BE WHAT'S BEST

1281
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:12,058
FOR RIGHT NOW.

1282
00:33:21,800 --> 00:33:22,468
>> YAY.

1283
00:33:22,468 --> 00:33:24,503
THE UGLY BACKPACK.

1284
00:33:24,503 --> 00:33:25,471
I HAVEN'T SEEN RYAN

1285
00:33:25,471 --> 00:33:27,005
SINCE THE HALLOWEEN PARTY.

1286
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,307
BUT TOMORROW IS MY FIRST DAY

1287
00:33:28,307 --> 00:33:29,108
BACK TO SCHOOL,

1288
00:33:29,108 --> 00:33:30,742
AND I'M NOT LOOKING FORWARD

1289
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,010
TO RUNNING INTO HIM.

1290
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,379
PLUS, MY HOMEWORK ISN'T

1291
00:33:33,379 --> 00:33:34,713
ORGANIZED, AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT

1292
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:35,847
HAVING ENOUGH TIME IN

1293
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,549
THE MORNING TO GET MIAH READY

1294
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:38,350
FOR DAYCARE.

1295
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,252
TWO PACKS OF WIPES.

1296
00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:41,120
>> SO WHAT TIME ARE YOU

1297
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,121
GETTING UP IN THE MORNING

1298
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:43,255
TO GET READY FOR SCHOOL?

1299
00:33:43,255 --> 00:33:44,523
>> 5:00.

1300
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:45,457
[chuckles]

1301
00:33:45,457 --> 00:33:48,860
>> YOU'RE GONNA BE TIRED.

1302
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:51,630
[alarm blaring]

1303
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,233
>> WE'RE GOING TO SCHOOL.

1304
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:55,267
>> WELL, IT OUGHT TO BE

1305
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:56,068
INTERESTING TO SEE

1306
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:57,436
HOW YOUR FIRST DAY GOES.

1307
00:33:57,436 --> 00:33:59,305
>> YEAH.

1308
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,377
SO HOW DOES THIS WORK?

1309
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:06,345
>> THAT GOES AROUND HER

1310
00:34:06,345 --> 00:34:08,114
SHOULDERS RIGHT HERE, OKAY?

1311
00:34:08,114 --> 00:34:10,316
OKAY, PUT HER LITTLE LEGS--

1312
00:34:10,316 --> 00:34:11,450
THAT'S IT.

1313
00:34:11,450 --> 00:34:12,484
NOW, YOU CAN CINCH IT UP,

1314
00:34:12,484 --> 00:34:13,452
'CAUSE THAT NEEDS TO FIT HER

1315
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:14,186
KIND OF TIGHT.

1316
00:34:14,186 --> 00:34:17,856
>> YEAH.

1317
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:18,890
I HAVE NEVER CARRIED

1318
00:34:18,890 --> 00:34:20,859
THIS MUCH STUFF TO SCHOOL, EVER.

1319
00:34:25,497 --> 00:34:26,598
HELLO.

1320
00:34:26,598 --> 00:34:27,999
>> HI, BABY.

1321
00:34:27,999 --> 00:34:28,834
>> UM, WELL, I GUESS

1322
00:34:28,834 --> 00:34:29,901
I GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE,

1323
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:30,769
SO SEE YOU GUYS LATER.

1324
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:32,204
>> SEE YOU LATER.

1325
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:33,339
>> JUST GETTING TO SCHOOL FELT

1326
00:34:33,339 --> 00:34:35,006
LIKE A FULL DAY'S WORK.

1327
00:34:35,006 --> 00:34:36,942
BUT AFTER BEING OUT FOR A MONTH,

1328
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:37,943
I KNOW THE HARD PART

1329
00:34:37,943 --> 00:34:39,111
IS JUST BEGINNING.

1330
00:34:39,111 --> 00:34:40,179
>> I'M GONNA GIVE YOU

1331
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:42,013
WHAT THEY WORKED ON ON FRIDAY.

1332
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:43,515
>> OKAY.

1333
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:44,516
YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA HAVE TO

1334
00:34:44,516 --> 00:34:45,284
HELP ME WITH IT.

1335
00:34:45,284 --> 00:34:46,718
>> YEAH, WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO

1336
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:49,288
IS, YOU'RE JUST GONNA

1337
00:34:49,288 --> 00:34:50,956
PLOT THE POINTS

1338
00:34:50,956 --> 00:34:52,458
AND FIND THE SLOPE

1339
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:56,162
AND THE DISTANCE FORMULA.

1340
00:34:56,162 --> 00:34:57,263
>> I'M STILL ON TRACK TO

1341
00:34:57,263 --> 00:34:58,564
GRADUATE THIS SPRING, BUT I'M

1342
00:34:58,564 --> 00:35:00,166
USED TO MAKING STRAIGHT "A"s,

1343
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:01,600
AND KEEPING MY GRADES UP

1344
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,634
WHILE TAKING CARE OF MIAH

1345
00:35:02,634 --> 00:35:03,469
WILL BE TOUGH.

1346
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:04,936
>> WHICH MAJOR POPULATION SHIFT

1347
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:06,938
IN THE LATE 1800s OCCURRED AS

1348
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,640
A RESULT OF INDUSTRIALIZATION?

1349
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,841
>> [stammers]

1350
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:10,676
NO.

1351
00:35:10,676 --> 00:35:11,977
>> I HAVEN'T READ FAR ENOUGH

1352
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:13,312
TO THIS ONE, SO--

1353
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:15,647
>> OKAY.

1354
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:20,652
[beeping]

1355
00:35:20,652 --> 00:35:21,787
>> RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF

1356
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:23,589
MY HISTORY EXAM, I GOT A TEXT

1357
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:24,990
THAT MIAH WAS HUNGRY.

1358
00:35:24,990 --> 00:35:25,824
HI.

1359
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:28,460
HOW ARE WE DOING?

1360
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,461
LET'S GET SOME FOOD

1361
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:30,829
IN YOUR SYSTEM.

1362
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:32,864
WE GOT TO MAKE IT TO 3:00.

1363
00:35:32,864 --> 00:35:33,932
MY FIRST DAY BACK HAS BEEN

1364
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:35,000
PRETTY STRESSFUL,

1365
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,268
AND I KNOW SEEING RYAN

1366
00:35:36,268 --> 00:35:37,836
WILL MAKE IT WORSE.

1367
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:39,205
LUCKILY, I'VE BEEN ABLE

1368
00:35:39,205 --> 00:35:40,472
TO AVOID HIM.

1369
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:43,575
>> WHAT'S IT LIKE BEING BACK?

1370
00:35:43,575 --> 00:35:46,778
>> CHAOTIC.

1371
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:47,713
IT THREW ME OFF GUARD WHEN

1372
00:35:47,713 --> 00:35:48,880
THEY WERE LIKE, "IT'S TIME FOR--

1373
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,015
MIAH NEEDS TO EAT."

1374
00:35:50,015 --> 00:35:51,783
I WAS LIKE, "WHAT?"

1375
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:52,784
'CAUSE I'M NOT USED TO THAT,

1376
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:53,419
YOU KNOW?

1377
00:35:53,419 --> 00:35:54,353
I'M JUST KIND OF LIKE--

1378
00:35:54,353 --> 00:35:55,954
BEING BACK IN SCHOOL FEELS

1379
00:35:55,954 --> 00:35:58,156
REALLY AWKWARD, AND EVERYBODY'S

1380
00:35:58,156 --> 00:35:59,891
GIVING ME THIS WEIRD VIBE

1381
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:00,792
AND LOOKING AT ME

1382
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:02,461
LIKE THEY KNOW SOMETHING.

1383
00:36:02,461 --> 00:36:03,729
AND IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG

1384
00:36:03,729 --> 00:36:05,297
TO FIND OUT WHY.

1385
00:36:05,297 --> 00:36:07,032
AFTER LUNCH, MY FRIEND SYBIL

1386
00:36:07,032 --> 00:36:08,099
TOLD ME THAT RYAN

1387
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,668
ALREADY HAS A NEW GIRLFRIEND

1388
00:36:09,668 --> 00:36:10,869
AND THAT HE'S BEEN SEEING HER

1389
00:36:10,869 --> 00:36:11,903
FOR MONTHS.

1390
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:12,938
AND I'M PRETTY SURE

1391
00:36:12,938 --> 00:36:14,039
THAT'S WHO HE WAS WITH

1392
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:16,141
THE NIGHT I WENT INTO LABOR.

1393
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:17,509
AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE,

1394
00:36:17,509 --> 00:36:18,944
EVERYONE IN SCHOOL KNEW

1395
00:36:18,944 --> 00:36:20,646
EXCEPT ME.

1396
00:36:20,646 --> 00:36:21,813
I FEEL--

1397
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:22,714
WHO CHEATS ON

1398
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:24,383
THEIR PREGNANT GIRLFRIEND?

1399
00:36:24,383 --> 00:36:28,487
>> A DOUCHE BAG.

1400
00:36:28,487 --> 00:36:30,922
RYAN.

1401
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:32,491
>> I'VE TRIED, YOU KNOW,

1402
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:33,659
TO WORK WITH HIM,

1403
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:36,328
TO YOU KNOW, FOR HER TO SEE HIM.

1404
00:36:36,328 --> 00:36:37,296
AND THE FACT THAT HE'S JUST

1405
00:36:37,296 --> 00:36:38,830
LIED TO ME THIS WHOLE TIME,

1406
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:40,165
I'M JUST LIKE, I'M DONE.

1407
00:36:40,165 --> 00:36:41,267
I'M NOT GONNA DEAL WITH HIM.

1408
00:36:41,267 --> 00:36:42,434
I'M NOT GONNA WORK WITH HIM

1409
00:36:42,434 --> 00:36:43,101
ANYMORE,

1410
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:44,536
BECAUSE ALL IT'S DONE

1411
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:47,773
IS HURT ME.

1412
00:36:47,773 --> 00:36:50,442
>> IT'S JUST MEAN.

1413
00:36:50,442 --> 00:36:53,044
>> IT MEANS LAWYER, COURT...

1414
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:54,380
UM,

1415
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,715
I GET FULL CUSTODY.

1416
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:59,785
RYAN'S NOT GONNA SEE HER

1417
00:36:59,785 --> 00:37:01,287
BECAUSE I JUST--

1418
00:37:01,287 --> 00:37:03,088
I NEED TIME.

1419
00:37:27,813 --> 00:37:29,748
>> FINDING OUT THAT RYAN

1420
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,683
CHEATED ON ME WAS A SHOCK.

1421
00:37:31,683 --> 00:37:33,018
HE STILL THINKS HE SHOULD GET TO

1422
00:37:33,018 --> 00:37:34,520
SEE MIAH, SO I NEED TO TELL HIM

1423
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,621
THAT I KNOW THE TRUTH

1424
00:37:35,621 --> 00:37:36,988
AND THAT I'VE DECIDED

1425
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:37,889
TO HAVE CUSTODY

1426
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:39,825
SETTLED IN COURT.

1427
00:37:39,825 --> 00:37:41,560
>> SO WHERE'S MIAH?

1428
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,962
>> AT HOME.

1429
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:44,963
>> WE REALLY DO NEED TO FIGURE

1430
00:37:44,963 --> 00:37:46,498
SOMETHING OUT.

1431
00:37:46,498 --> 00:37:49,401
I KNOW YOU'VE GOT RESENTMENT

1432
00:37:49,401 --> 00:37:51,169
TOWARDS ME AND--

1433
00:37:51,169 --> 00:37:52,904
>> YOU CHEATED ON ME.

1434
00:37:52,904 --> 00:37:54,506
>> I CHEATED ON YOU?

1435
00:37:54,506 --> 00:37:55,341
>> YES.

1436
00:37:55,341 --> 00:37:56,174
I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA

1437
00:37:56,174 --> 00:37:57,275
JUST DENY IT.

1438
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,009
I KNOW.

1439
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:00,512
I MEAN,

1440
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:01,480
YOU HAVEN'T REALLY GIVEN ME

1441
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:03,449
MUCH TO BELIEVE ANYMORE LATELY.

1442
00:38:03,449 --> 00:38:04,350
SO--

1443
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:06,985
>> I JUST FEEL LIKE USING MIAH

1444
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:09,655
TO GET BACK AT ME OR SOMETHING--

1445
00:38:09,655 --> 00:38:10,589
YOU'RE USING MIAH

1446
00:38:10,589 --> 00:38:14,360
AS A TOOL TO HURT ME AND--

1447
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:15,327
>> IT'S NOT EVEN ABOUT THAT

1448
00:38:15,327 --> 00:38:15,994
RIGHT NOW.

1449
00:38:15,994 --> 00:38:16,828
>> AT THE SAME TIME--

1450
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:17,763
>> LISTEN, RYAN.

1451
00:38:17,763 --> 00:38:19,064
YOU AND I AREN'T GONNA WORK

1452
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:20,632
ANYTHING OUT.

1453
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:21,967
ALL WE'RE GONNA DO IS FIGHT,

1454
00:38:21,967 --> 00:38:23,301
AND I JUST--I DON'T WANT TO

1455
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:24,135
DO THAT ANYMORE.

1456
00:38:24,135 --> 00:38:27,305
I FEEL LIKE GOING TO THE COURT,

1457
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:29,575
GETTING SOMETHING THAT WE--

1458
00:38:29,575 --> 00:38:31,142
EITHER BOTH OF US CAN AGREE ON

1459
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:32,544
OR THE COURT DECIDES

1460
00:38:32,544 --> 00:38:34,279
IS BEST FOR HER.

1461
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:35,414
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S EXACTLY

1462
00:38:35,414 --> 00:38:37,215
BEST FOR MIAH JUST TO COMPLETELY

1463
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:39,751
KEEP HER FROM ME UNTIL THEN.

1464
00:38:39,751 --> 00:38:40,919
LIKE, I DON'T EVEN FEEL LIKE

1465
00:38:40,919 --> 00:38:42,087
SHE'S GONNA KNOW ME WHEN I DO

1466
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:43,422
WHEN ALL THIS COURT STUFF GETS

1467
00:38:43,422 --> 00:38:45,156
SETTLED 'CAUSE IT'S GONNA BE--

1468
00:38:45,156 --> 00:38:46,992
YOU KNOW, IT COULD BE MONTHS.

1469
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:48,394
>> I MEAN, REALLY, THE BOTTOM

1470
00:38:48,394 --> 00:38:49,728
LINE IS, LIKE,

1471
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:51,262
WE HAVE TO GO TO COURT,

1472
00:38:51,262 --> 00:38:53,098
AND THAT'S THAT.

1473
00:38:59,738 --> 00:39:01,039
>> * IT'S RUMORED *

1474
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:04,342
* YOU'RE COMING APART *

1475
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,744
>> I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WOULD

1476
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:07,212
TURN OUT WAY DIFFERENT THAN IT

1477
00:39:07,212 --> 00:39:08,480
REALLY DID.

1478
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,450
I THOUGHT ME AND RYAN

1479
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:13,018
WOULD STAY TOGETHER.

1480
00:39:13,018 --> 00:39:14,786
BUT WE DIDN'T, SO--

1481
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:15,954
HE HAD ALWAYS TOLD ME, "OH,

1482
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:17,789
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY.

1483
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:19,858
I'M GONNA TAKE CARE OF YOU.

1484
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:21,460
WE'RE GONNA BE TOGETHER."

1485
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,928
AND I BELIEVED IT.

1486
00:39:22,928 --> 00:39:24,596
FINDING OUT THAT HE HAD BEEN

1487
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:25,397
CHEATING ON ME

1488
00:39:25,397 --> 00:39:27,165
AND HAD BEEN WITH OTHER GIRLS,

1489
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:28,166
THAT REALLY DID SUCK.

1490
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:28,900
>> WHAT CAN WE

1491
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,701
HELP YOU OUT WITH?

1492
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:30,502
