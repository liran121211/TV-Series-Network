1
00:00:04,521 --> 00:00:09,457
- I'm Chelsea, and my life
is all about having fun.

2
00:00:09,561 --> 00:00:11,839
I live in Vermillion,
South Dakota, and I'm really

3
00:00:11,942 --> 00:00:13,737
close with both of my parents.

4
00:00:13,841 --> 00:00:16,257
But since they got divorced
a few years ago, I mostly live

5
00:00:16,361 --> 00:00:18,915
with my dad, because I'm a total
daddy's girl.

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,468
Can we make this?

7
00:00:20,572 --> 00:00:21,814
- Squash?

8
00:00:21,918 --> 00:00:23,195
- I've wanting it all day.

9
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:26,923
My dad really gets me...

10
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,236
except when it comes
to my boyfriend Adam.

11
00:00:29,339 --> 00:00:32,204
[chime dings]
Adam, like, changed his Facebook

12
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:34,896
status, and it was, like,
"I wish Chelsea wasn't such a

13
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,554
whore and didn't want all my
friends and just wanted me."

14
00:00:37,658 --> 00:00:39,591
- Well, then, I suppose, we
don't need to talk to him

15
00:00:39,694 --> 00:00:41,593
anymore, do we? Ever?

16
00:00:41,696 --> 00:00:43,422
- With me and Adam, there's
always drama.

17
00:00:43,526 --> 00:00:45,769
He usually has a problem with
whatever I do and whoever I do

18
00:00:45,873 --> 00:00:46,736
it with.

19
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:48,220
Are you going to Jack's?

20
00:00:48,324 --> 00:00:49,670
- I have no idea.

21
00:00:49,773 --> 00:00:52,259
- Well, I'll probably go,
if that's okay.

22
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:55,917
- No matter how much drama we
may have, he's in my life for

23
00:00:56,021 --> 00:01:00,370
good now, because I'm pregnant.

24
00:01:07,826 --> 00:01:09,759
- I was a junior when I got
pregnant, but now it's the end

25
00:01:09,862 --> 00:01:12,762
of summer before my senior year,
and I'm coming back to school

26
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:14,108
with a much bigger belly.

27
00:01:14,212 --> 00:01:16,214
I don't really know what to
expect.

28
00:01:16,317 --> 00:01:18,595
All I know for sure is,
I'm having a girl, and we're

29
00:01:18,699 --> 00:01:19,976
naming her Aubrey.

30
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,840
- When you go back, do you
think will be shocked, like,

31
00:01:21,943 --> 00:01:22,841
at how big you are?

32
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:25,015
Or, like, does everybody know?

33
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,500
- I'm pretty sure everybody
knows.

34
00:01:26,603 --> 00:01:28,018
Like, I think everybody knows.

35
00:01:28,122 --> 00:01:30,262
- What are you going to do with
Aubrey?

36
00:01:30,366 --> 00:01:32,092
- I'll probably just put her in
daycare.

37
00:01:32,195 --> 00:01:34,094
Unless you want to, like, quit
school and come be my nanny?

38
00:01:34,197 --> 00:01:35,474
- Totally.

39
00:01:35,578 --> 00:01:37,407
- Hey.

40
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:39,720
I don't think I'm scared of
giving--having her.

41
00:01:39,823 --> 00:01:40,859
Like, giving birth.

42
00:01:40,962 --> 00:01:41,963
- I'm scared for you.

43
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:43,758
- You are?
- Yeah.

44
00:01:43,862 --> 00:01:46,589
- I don't want to poop when I
push her out.

45
00:01:46,692 --> 00:01:49,005
Seriously, I asked my doctor
about it.

46
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:50,179
- What did she say?

47
00:01:50,282 --> 00:01:53,043
- She said, "Oh, it's normal.

48
00:01:53,147 --> 00:01:55,874
We won't tell you if you do."

49
00:01:55,977 --> 00:01:57,013
- I would want to know.

50
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,152
- No, I don't want to know.

51
00:01:58,256 --> 00:01:59,464
I'll be all embarrassed.

52
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:01,086
You better not tell me.

53
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,363
- [laughing] I won't.

54
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:04,400
- If you start laughing,
I'm kicking you out.

55
00:02:04,503 --> 00:02:05,918
You'd be scared.

56
00:02:06,022 --> 00:02:09,129
- If I was pregnant and I was
pushing out a baby and I started

57
00:02:09,232 --> 00:02:12,166
pooping, you would laugh your
ass off.

58
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,616
- Shut up.
- You would.

59
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:15,445
- Not if we're in the moment.

60
00:02:15,549 --> 00:02:17,896
Talking to Megan about being
pregnant is easy,

61
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:20,243
but telling my dad about it
was one of the hardest things

62
00:02:20,347 --> 00:02:21,727
ever.

63
00:02:21,831 --> 00:02:23,936
Didn't mom tell you I was
pregnant?

64
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,008
- Yeah, she just called and
said, "We got a problem."

65
00:02:27,112 --> 00:02:29,010
And I just kinda guessed.

66
00:02:30,978 --> 00:02:32,807
- Yeah, but I can't even take
regular medicine.

67
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:33,912
- I know.

68
00:02:34,015 --> 00:02:35,741
- I was just really scared to
tell you.

69
00:02:35,845 --> 00:02:37,329
I felt like you were going
to be sad

70
00:02:37,433 --> 00:02:40,470
that your, like, your youngest
baby was going to have a baby.

71
00:02:40,574 --> 00:02:42,955
- "Disappointed" is the word
you're thinking of,

72
00:02:43,059 --> 00:02:44,543
and I was.

73
00:02:44,647 --> 00:02:46,959
There's no use flying off the
handle and wigging out about it,

74
00:02:47,063 --> 00:02:50,411
because you can't undo it,
so you have to accept it.

75
00:02:50,515 --> 00:02:52,137
- There's not a choice to undo
it for us.

76
00:02:52,241 --> 00:02:53,518
- No, not for us.

77
00:02:53,621 --> 00:02:55,589
- Did you ever think I should
give it up for adoption?

78
00:02:55,692 --> 00:02:57,038
- I didn't think so. No.

79
00:02:58,764 --> 00:03:01,215
Because we've got a strong
enough family that we could

80
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,734
always take care of it.

81
00:03:02,837 --> 00:03:05,978
- Like, I was in the hospital
and the doctor, like, as he was

82
00:03:06,082 --> 00:03:08,878
telling me I was for sure
pregnant, Adam was texting me,

83
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:11,467
like, breaking up with me
and saying I should get

84
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:13,089
an abortion and stuff.

85
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,781
Then the next day he, like,
completely switched.

86
00:03:15,885 --> 00:03:20,165
He's just being really nice
and, like, happy.

87
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:22,719
So I was like, "Okay, maybe it's
going to be good.

88
00:03:22,823 --> 00:03:25,101
Maybe this is going to fix
everything."

89
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,828
- The last thing he was looking
for was more responsibility.

90
00:03:27,931 --> 00:03:29,554
- Like, it's going to turn out
fine.

91
00:03:29,657 --> 00:03:32,695
My dad's not going
to take my word for it.

92
00:03:32,798 --> 00:03:37,286
He wants to talk to Adam
himself.

93
00:03:37,389 --> 00:03:39,322
- What's up?
- Nothing.

94
00:03:39,426 --> 00:03:40,599
- Want to have a little talk?

95
00:03:40,703 --> 00:03:41,600
- I s'pose, yeah.

96
00:03:41,704 --> 00:03:44,224
- "S'pose, yeah," huh?"

97
00:03:47,468 --> 00:03:49,436
We've had a little past,
you and I.

98
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:51,092
- Yeah, it's been bad.

99
00:03:51,196 --> 00:03:54,475
- And, you know, I'm not above
forgiving...

100
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:56,097
- Yeah?

101
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:59,308
- And accepting things if you'd
treat my girl the way she needs

102
00:03:59,411 --> 00:04:00,826
to be treated.

103
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,245
It's time to put up or shut up,
and is it going to change?

104
00:04:05,348 --> 00:04:06,246
- Yeah, it's going to change.

105
00:04:06,349 --> 00:04:08,489
It's time to get serious and
grow up.

106
00:04:08,593 --> 00:04:10,008
- Why is it time now?

107
00:04:10,111 --> 00:04:12,700
- I don't know.
It's just time.

108
00:04:12,804 --> 00:04:14,564
- You know, some of the things
that you said in the past

109
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:17,981
would've led me to believe that
you really couldn't give a hoot

110
00:04:18,085 --> 00:04:20,432
about the baby.

111
00:04:20,536 --> 00:04:23,263
Is that the way it is, or is
that--I don't have a whole lot

112
00:04:23,366 --> 00:04:24,643
of faith in things.

113
00:04:24,747 --> 00:04:26,956
- Yeah, it'll change.

114
00:04:27,059 --> 00:04:29,269
When the baby is born, I planned
on staying here for a couple

115
00:04:29,372 --> 00:04:30,822
weeks.

116
00:04:30,925 --> 00:04:34,170
Pretty much just, like, almost
live here and stay with her

117
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:35,447
while Chelsea's in school.

118
00:04:35,551 --> 00:04:37,104
- I don't know about moving in.

119
00:04:37,207 --> 00:04:40,694
As far as--but staying for
periods of time is two totally

120
00:04:40,797 --> 00:04:41,660
different things.

121
00:04:41,764 --> 00:04:42,972
- Yeah, definitely.

122
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:45,008
- Odds are you won't be moving
in.

123
00:04:45,112 --> 00:04:46,907
You think it's going to be cool
to get--to have a baby?

124
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:47,873
I mean, you're excited?

125
00:04:47,977 --> 00:04:49,875
- Oh, yeah. Really excited.

126
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:51,429
- You like staying up all
night?

127
00:04:51,532 --> 00:04:52,464
- Yeah, actually I do.

128
00:04:52,568 --> 00:04:53,948
- Poopy diapers.
Screaming kids.

129
00:04:54,052 --> 00:04:55,053
- I don't know about that.

130
00:04:55,156 --> 00:04:56,572
- Throwing up.

131
00:04:56,675 --> 00:04:58,470
You don't have to like it,
but you just have to be ready

132
00:04:58,574 --> 00:05:00,161
to deal with it.

133
00:05:00,265 --> 00:05:03,061
So I want to toss the ball to
you. It's in your court.

134
00:05:05,063 --> 00:05:05,926
- Okay.

135
00:05:07,065 --> 00:05:08,825
- What did he say?
What did he say?

136
00:05:08,929 --> 00:05:10,344
- He said it was time to get,
like, serious.

137
00:05:10,448 --> 00:05:11,759
Obviously.

138
00:05:11,863 --> 00:05:13,451
- And not get mad so easy?

139
00:05:13,554 --> 00:05:14,486
- You too?

140
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,764
- I know, both of us.

141
00:05:16,868 --> 00:05:18,766
So we're together.

142
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:19,664
- Yeah, we're together.

143
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:21,079
- And serious.

144
00:05:21,182 --> 00:05:23,115
- Yeah.

145
00:05:23,219 --> 00:05:24,220
- I love you.

146
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:26,291

- I love you.

147
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:31,434
[chime dings]
- My dad tossed the ball to

148
00:05:31,538 --> 00:05:34,713
Adam, and he's running with it.

149
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:37,406
Things are better than ever.

150
00:05:37,509 --> 00:05:39,960
We've never been so in sync.

151
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:43,964
Okay, bye.
Give me a smooch.

152
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:46,311
I just hope it lasts.

153
00:05:57,218 --> 00:05:59,945
- I've been having early
contractions, so I've been going

154
00:06:00,049 --> 00:06:02,154
in for ultrasounds every week.

155
00:06:02,258 --> 00:06:04,709
Adam can't come to my
appointment today, so I invited

156
00:06:04,812 --> 00:06:06,676
Megan and my mom instead.

157
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:10,887
- No. I don't even know
what they are.

158
00:06:10,991 --> 00:06:12,544
- It's like a practice
contraction.

159
00:06:12,648 --> 00:06:15,789
And when I went to that doctor,
I was a fingertip dilated.

160
00:06:15,892 --> 00:06:16,928
- Fingertip?

161
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:18,447
- Yeah, that's the beginning.

162
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,828
- So it's, like, always open
that much?

163
00:06:20,932 --> 00:06:23,383
- Yeah, I guess.

164
00:06:23,486 --> 00:06:24,384
That's weird.

165
00:06:24,487 --> 00:06:27,801
- It can go up to, like, what,
ten?

166
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:28,767
- That's too big.

167
00:06:28,871 --> 00:06:29,837
- I don't know.

168
00:06:29,941 --> 00:06:31,080
Shoulders.

169
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:32,322
You got to get those shoulders
in there.

170
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:34,877
- Tight squeeze.
- And the head. Oh, boy.

171
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,672
- Don't even start.

172
00:06:36,775 --> 00:06:37,949
- Hi.
- Hi.

173
00:06:38,052 --> 00:06:39,364
- How are you?
- Good.

174

00:13:52,728 --> 00:13:55,075
- Because that's part of senior
year, going out and doing

349
00:13:55,179 --> 00:13:56,387
whatever you want.

350
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:58,182
- I can still go out and party.

351
00:13:58,285 --> 00:14:00,425
- Don't be dumb.

352
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:08,848
I kind of want her to be, like,
a daddy's girl.

353
00:14:08,951 --> 00:14:10,366
You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

354
00:14:12,955 --> 00:14:15,302
- Like, he wants a boy,
but I think when he has his

355
00:14:15,406 --> 00:14:16,683
little girl, it'll be different.

356
00:14:16,786 --> 00:14:17,649
- Ha ha.

357
00:14:21,308 --> 00:14:23,138
- And how many weeks till
the baby's born?

358
00:14:23,241 --> 00:14:24,104
- Like, nine.

359
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,417
She can come before that.

360
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:27,556
Why do you have a rock?

361
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,523
- They're throwing it.
- Why?

362
00:14:29,627 --> 00:14:30,455
- Because that's what they do.

363
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:32,768
- Where you throwing it in at?

364
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:35,736
[splash]
[laughs]

365
00:14:39,533 --> 00:14:43,399
There goes all our fish.

366
00:14:43,503 --> 00:14:45,885
- I'm glad Adam and I are being
kids while we still can.

367
00:14:45,988 --> 00:14:48,888
I wish summer would never end,
but there's a lot to figure out

368
00:14:48,991 --> 00:14:50,268
before the baby comes.

369
00:14:50,372 --> 00:14:51,373
- What you doing?

370
00:14:51,476 --> 00:14:52,995
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

371
00:14:53,099 --> 00:14:55,239
We got to talk over school.

372
00:14:55,342 --> 00:14:57,103
What's my number one goal?

373
00:14:57,206 --> 00:14:58,104
- You want me to graduate.

374
00:14:58,207 --> 00:14:59,726
- With your class.
- Yeah.

375
00:14:59,829 --> 00:15:01,452
- How do you think you're going
to handle walking through

376
00:15:01,555 --> 00:15:03,350
the halls pregnant?

377
00:15:03,454 --> 00:15:04,696
- Fine. That's not a big deal
at all to me.

378
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,077
- That's not a big deal?
- Not at all.

379
00:15:06,181 --> 00:15:08,597
- Okay. What about the stupid
talk behind your back

380
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,219
as you walk down the hall?

381
00:15:10,323 --> 00:15:11,462
- I'll yell.

382
00:15:11,565 --> 00:15:14,672
- Well, no, you don't yell.

383
00:15:14,775 --> 00:15:16,777
You can't change it,
so you hold your head up high.

384
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:19,711
- Hey, I'm not worried at all
about how school's going to be.

385
00:15:24,544 --> 00:15:26,097
- [bell rings]

386
00:15:29,066 --> 00:15:31,551
- When I used to imagine my
senior year, I wondered what

387
00:15:31,654 --> 00:15:35,244
yearbook title I'd get;
if I'd be homecoming queen,

388
00:15:35,348 --> 00:15:39,179
and what I'd wear to prom.

389
00:15:39,283 --> 00:15:43,356
I never imagined being pregnant
and not being able to fit into

390
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:45,599
my desk.

391
00:15:48,292 --> 00:15:49,258
- Yeah.

392
00:15:49,362 --> 00:15:50,777
Aubrey Skye.

393
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,298
Actually now I'm having one of
those Braxton Hicks contractions

394
00:15:54,401 --> 00:15:55,609
or whatever.

395
00:15:55,713 --> 00:15:58,474
My stomach is really hard.

396
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:03,031
- So now go back into your
"y" equals--

397
00:16:03,134 --> 00:16:05,654
- I suddenly feel like I'm
having contractions.

398
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:07,794
I'm trying to focus on math
class since they're probably

399
00:16:07,897 --> 00:16:09,969
just practice, but they seem to
be getting worse.

400
00:16:10,072 --> 00:16:11,522
- Negative 2 is?

401
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,490
What do you think, Chelsea?

402
00:16:14,594 --> 00:16:15,836
What are you doing?

403
00:16:20,255 --> 00:16:21,290
Laura, will you help me?

404
00:16:21,394 --> 00:16:22,912
- Yes.

405
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:25,570
- Something doesn't feel right,
and I need to get out of here.

406
00:16:27,917 --> 00:16:29,781
Laura and I ran to the nurse.

407
00:16:31,404 --> 00:16:32,819
She thought I was in labor.

408
00:16:32,922 --> 00:16:36,409
The next thing I knew, I was
being rushed to the hospital.

409
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:38,169
By the time Adam and my family
got there,

410
00:16:38,273 --> 00:16:39,688
the pain was unbearable.

411
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:42,001
[moans]
Finally, the doctor said it was

412
00:16:42,104 --> 00:16:43,381
time to push.

413
00:16:43,485 --> 00:16:46,522
But it's five weeks early,
and I'm terrified for my baby.

414
00:16:46,626 --> 00:16:48,904
I can't believe this is
happening now.

415
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,389
- Here we go. Grab those legs.

416
00:16:51,493 --> 00:16:53,219
There you go.
Push down nice and hard.

417
00:16:53,322 --> 00:16:55,497
Push, push, push, push, push.

418
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:57,154
Good.

419
00:16:57,257 --> 00:16:58,431
One more big push.

420
00:16:58,534 --> 00:17:01,572
Big breath.

421
00:17:01,675 --> 00:17:04,437
Good job. Very good.

422
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,059
That's a great last push.

423
00:17:06,163 --> 00:17:07,440
Okay, ready?

424
00:17:07,543 --> 00:17:08,751
Here we go.

425
00:17:08,855 --> 00:17:11,789
Come on, big push.

426
00:17:11,892 --> 00:17:13,584
A nice and strong one.

427
00:17:13,687 --> 00:17:16,138
- Go, go, go, go.

428
00:17:16,242 --> 00:17:17,519
Good job, Chelsea.

429
00:17:17,622 --> 00:17:18,520
- Good.

430
00:17:18,623 --> 00:17:21,005
- Good job.

431
00:17:21,109 --> 00:17:25,078
- Go. Oh! Oh!

432
00:17:25,182 --> 00:17:27,149
- She's so small.

433
00:17:44,925 --> 00:17:46,306
- Ms. Harmony, 3792.

434
00:17:46,410 --> 00:17:48,722
Dr. Harmony, 3792.

435
00:17:57,145 --> 00:17:59,181
- Even though Aubrey was born
five weeks early, and the

436
00:17:59,285 --> 00:18:02,909
doctors were really worried
at first,

437
00:18:03,012 --> 00:18:06,085
it seems like she's going
to be okay.

438
00:18:06,188 --> 00:18:08,949
- She is quite jaundiced,
which is something that is--

439
00:18:09,053 --> 00:18:11,228
all pre-term babies are at risk
for.

440
00:18:11,331 --> 00:18:15,370
- Yeah, so this light makes
the jaundice levels go down.

441
00:18:15,473 --> 00:18:16,785
- It does.

442
00:18:16,888 --> 00:18:18,476

- But having a preemie means
having to deal with all kinds of

443
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,960
problems.

444
00:18:20,064 --> 00:18:21,790
- I know you wanted to nurse,
but she just doesn't have the

445
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:22,963
strength to do that right now.

446
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:24,793
- What about her temperature?

447
00:18:24,896 --> 00:18:26,035
Is that a big concern?

448
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:28,383
- Yeah, when babies are
premature like this,

449
00:18:28,486 --> 00:18:30,488
they have a harder time
regulating their own

450
00:18:30,592 --> 00:18:31,834
temperature.

451
00:18:31,938 --> 00:18:34,389
That might make her start having
respiratory problems.

452
00:18:34,492 --> 00:18:35,528
- Does it hurt?

453
00:18:35,631 --> 00:18:37,357
- No, it feels cool.

454
00:18:37,461 --> 00:18:39,083
[laughter]
- Yeah, there you go.

455
00:18:39,187 --> 00:18:43,467
- Okay, I don't want to get,
like, your hair in the milk.

456
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:44,847
- Look at that.

457
00:18:44,951 --> 00:18:46,677
Hey, I think she smiled at me.

458
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,850
- What about her temperature?

459
00:18:47,954 --> 00:18:49,300
Is she keeping--
- It's better.

460
00:18:49,404 --> 00:18:50,508
Like, she only has one blanket.

461
00:18:50,612 --> 00:18:51,682
She doesn't need a hat.

462
00:18:51,785 --> 00:18:54,029
Aubrey's getting stronger and so
is our family.

463
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,135
Adam even asked that she take
his last name on her

464
00:18:56,238 --> 00:18:57,619
birth certificate.

465
00:18:57,722 --> 00:18:59,655
I couldn't be happier.

466
00:18:59,759 --> 00:19:01,278
- ♪ Just a little bit 

467
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:03,418
- Baby's not going home today,
maybe even not going home

468
00:19:03,521 --> 00:19:05,213
tomorrow--
may not be going home for

469
00:19:05,316 --> 00:19:08,423
a week--but you are getting
discharged today.

470
00:19:08,526 --> 00:19:10,287
- Even though it's time for me
to go, the doctors want to keep

471
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:14,670
Aubrey in the hospital so she
can gain some weight.

472
00:19:14,774 --> 00:19:16,569
I don't want to leave you.

473
00:19:16,672 --> 00:19:17,777
Yeah.

474
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,227
I'll be back.

475
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:23,748
Since my mom lives near the
hospital, Adam and I are staying

476
00:19:23,852 --> 00:19:26,234
there to be close to her.

477
00:19:26,337 --> 00:19:28,581
When I woke up the next morning,
I couldn't wait to get back

478
00:19:28,684 --> 00:19:29,685
to Aubrey.

479
00:19:29,789 --> 00:19:32,101
Are you coming with me or not?

480
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:34,656
- I don't know. I'm tired.

481
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:37,141
I don't see whey we can't stay
here for a couple more hours

482
00:19:37,245 --> 00:19:38,142
and just sleep.

483
00:19:38,246 --> 00:19:39,799
- Because I want to go there.

484
00:19:39,902 --> 00:19:41,249
- Okay, then go.

485
00:19:41,352 --> 00:19:43,078
- Well, can you please just
come and sleep there?

486
00:19:43,182 --> 00:19:45,425
- No, I can't sleep there.

487
00:19:45,529 --> 00:19:46,944
- I feel like you don't care.

488
00:19:47,047 --> 00:19:47,979
- Don't even start.

489
00:19:48,083 --> 00:19:49,222
- Well, I do.

490
00:19:49,326 --> 00:19:50,327
Okay, whatever.

491
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,949
I'm going to go see our--
my daughter.

492
00:19:52,052 --> 00:19:54,814
- It's not like I'm not ever
going to see her again, Chelsea.

493
00:20:02,511 --> 00:20:04,617
- My mom drove me to the
hospital, where Adam said he'd

494
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,275
meet us later.

495
00:20:07,378 --> 00:20:09,415
- She just ate about 22 ccs,
okay?

496
00:20:09,518 --> 00:20:11,002
- Okay.
- There you go.

497
00:20:11,106 --> 00:20:13,453
- Oh, I missed her.

498
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:17,561
- Did you call him again and
see if he's coming, or

499
00:20:17,664 --> 00:20:20,288
what's the deal?

500
00:20:20,391 --> 00:20:21,910
- He won't answer.
He's sleeping.

501
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:24,499
[phone rings]

502
00:20:27,122 --> 00:20:30,229
- Your call has been forwarded
to a--

503
00:20:30,332 --> 00:20:32,265
- Irritating.

504
00:20:32,369 --> 00:20:34,509
- Super irritating.

505
00:20:38,029 --> 00:20:40,791
It may have taken awhile,
but Adam finally showed up

506
00:20:40,894 --> 00:20:45,036
to see Aubrey.

507
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,246
[laughs]

508
00:20:51,526 --> 00:20:53,735
- She's just going crazy. Oh.

509
00:20:53,838 --> 00:20:54,632
- Look at that.

510
00:20:54,736 --> 00:20:56,013
She's, like, doing it herself.

511
00:20:56,116 --> 00:20:57,463
Don't even have to hold it.

512
00:20:57,566 --> 00:20:59,085
- Adam brought his friend along
because he's got big plans

513
00:20:59,188 --> 00:21:00,466
later.

514
00:21:00,569 --> 00:21:02,847
You can go work on your stupid
car.

515
00:21:02,951 --> 00:21:04,159
- Don't call it stupid.

516
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,609
I don't call her stupid.

517
00:21:05,712 --> 00:21:06,920
- That is not the same thing.

518
00:21:07,024 --> 00:21:07,818
Don't even compare that.

519
00:21:07,921 --> 00:21:08,888
- I know.

520
00:21:08,991 --> 00:21:09,992
Don't get all mad.

521
00:21:10,096 --> 00:21:11,511
- That was a really dumb thing
to say.

522
00:21:11,615 --> 00:21:12,788
When are you going to be back?

523
00:21:12,892 --> 00:21:14,169
- Later.
- What time?

524
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,446
- I don't know.

525
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:19,830
- So Adam took off to attend to
his other baby.

526
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:22,936
[engine puttering]
- That sounds so good, dude.

527
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,075
Are you going to drag race it?

528
00:21:24,179 --> 00:21:26,043
- Yeah, absolutely.

529
00:21:26,146 --> 00:21:28,494
- I told Adam that I'm spending
the night at the hospital

530
00:21:28,597 --> 00:21:30,806
because we might be able to
bring the baby home tomorrow.

531
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:32,670
I really want him to be here
with me.

532
00:21:32,774 --> 00:21:34,500
Then I talked to him this
morning, and he didn't even

533
00:21:34,603 --> 00:21:35,466
sleep last night.

534
00:21:35,570 --> 00:21:36,571
He worked on his car all night.

535
00:21:36,674 --> 00:21:38,849
So he hasn't even gone to sleep.

536
00:21:38,952 --> 00:21:39,712
- Oh, my gosh.

537
00:21:39,815 --> 00:21:40,989
So then he'll sleep all day.

538
00:21:41,092 --> 00:21:43,336
- Yeah.
- Probably.

539
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,754
- If she gets to go home
and he misses that, like,

540
00:21:47,858 --> 00:21:49,411
I don't know how I'd be able
to forgive him.

541
00:21:49,515 --> 00:21:50,826
- Oh, my god.

542
00:21:52,207 --> 00:21:53,346
- Chelsea.

543
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:54,658
- Hi.

544
00:21:54,761 --> 00:21:57,005
- The doctor's been here,
and everything's good.

545
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:58,558
And she's ready to go home.

546
00:21:58,662 --> 00:22:01,181
- She is?
- Yay.

547
00:22:01,285 --> 00:22:03,529
- Hey.
- Nice diaper bag.

548
00:22:03,632 --> 00:22:07,118
- It's so cute.

549
00:22:07,222 --> 00:22:08,775
I'm scared to drive with her.

550
00:22:08,879 --> 00:22:10,605
I can't believe Adam's missing
this.

551
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:13,090
I thought he'd show up to be
part of Aubrey's first moments

552
00:22:13,193 --> 00:22:15,334
at home, but I guess not.

553
00:22:15,437 --> 00:22:18,406
I've decided to stay at my mom's
for the first week so she can

554
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:20,339
show me what to do with this
baby.

555
00:22:20,442 --> 00:22:22,479
What if she starts pooping?

556
00:22:22,582 --> 00:22:24,860
- Well, I'm going to leave her
diaper on for now.

557
00:22:24,964 --> 00:22:26,690
Okay, let's do her hair first.

558
00:22:26,793 --> 00:22:29,624
You kind of start from the top
and go down.

559
00:22:29,727 --> 00:22:32,178
Okay, and then put a little bit
of soap on her.

560
00:22:32,281 --> 00:22:35,699
You getting your first bath.

561
00:22:35,802 --> 00:22:38,287
- I like your hair better
fluffy.

562
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:42,119
- Then you kind of just work--
work down her body.

563
00:22:42,222 --> 00:22:43,362
And that's really it.

564
00:22:43,465 --> 00:22:44,397
- She's clean?

565
00:22:44,501 --> 00:22:45,985
Did you like it?

566
00:22:46,088 --> 00:22:48,919
I'm starting to realize just how
much there is to learn.

567
00:22:49,022 --> 00:22:51,439
Even though I could've use some
help getting home, Adam finally

568
00:22:51,542 --> 00:22:54,442
woke up and came over.

569
00:22:54,545 --> 00:22:56,305
Here, help me.

570
00:22:56,409 --> 00:22:58,411
Don't you hold 'em like this?

571
00:22:58,515 --> 00:22:59,550
- I don't know.

572
00:22:59,654 --> 00:23:00,862
I've never done this.

573
00:23:00,965 --> 00:23:02,864
- Okay, you gotta hold still.

574
00:23:02,967 --> 00:23:04,728
Okay, ready for boob time.

575
00:23:04,831 --> 00:23:06,246
You gotta help me, babe.

576
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,351
- What?

577
00:23:07,455 --> 00:23:11,148
- You gotta hold her,
or something.

578
00:23:11,251 --> 00:23:12,908
Ugh.

579
00:23:13,012 --> 00:23:15,152
- Oh, my god.

580
00:23:15,255 --> 00:23:16,981
- It hurts.
- Is something coming out?

581
00:23:17,085 --> 00:23:18,017
- I don't know.

582
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,329
It hurts.

583
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:22,124
How do I do this?

584
00:23:22,228 --> 00:23:23,643
Can I switch boobs?

585
00:23:23,747 --> 00:23:26,197
- I don't know. I don't care.

586
00:23:26,301 --> 00:23:27,889
- You should care.

587
00:23:27,992 --> 00:23:31,582
- We should go to Z'kota Grill
tonight.

588
00:23:31,686 --> 00:23:32,928
- Why?

589
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,448
- Well, Adam, I have her.

590
00:23:35,552 --> 00:23:36,449
- I know.

591
00:23:36,553 --> 00:23:37,864
Can't your mom look after her?

592
00:23:37,968 --> 00:23:39,452
- Well, maybe it'd be best for
you to stay here since it's

593
00:23:39,556 --> 00:23:40,867
the first day she's home.

594
00:23:40,971 --> 00:23:42,351
You said it was going to be
different once she came home.

595
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:43,663
Didn't you?

596
00:23:45,216 --> 00:23:46,321
- What?

597
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:48,116
You didn't say it was going to
be different?

598
00:23:49,151 --> 00:23:51,153
- So can you just stay here
today?

599
00:23:51,257 --> 00:23:52,292
- [sighs] The whole day?

600
00:23:52,396 --> 00:23:53,397
- Yes, the whole day.

601
00:23:53,501 --> 00:23:54,605
- And the whole night?

602
00:23:54,709 --> 00:23:56,331
- Yes, the whole night.

603
00:23:59,161 --> 00:24:02,164
- No. It is
the first night home.

604
00:24:02,268 --> 00:24:05,409
- Ooh. So?

605
00:24:07,307 --> 00:24:08,999
[chime dings]
- Adam promised to step up

606
00:24:09,102 --> 00:24:11,450
now that Aubrey's here,
but it seems like he's stepping

607
00:24:11,553 --> 00:24:13,935
out instead.

608
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,086
- After a week at my mom's,
I'm ready to come home to my

609
00:24:27,189 --> 00:24:29,847
dad's and try to get back to my
normal life.

610
00:24:29,951 --> 00:24:31,746
I'm so happy to be home.

611
00:24:31,849 --> 00:24:35,128
[coos]
Ugh.

612
00:24:36,544 --> 00:24:37,959
She always--

613
00:24:38,062 --> 00:24:40,099
Why did she do that?

614
00:24:40,202 --> 00:24:44,690
- [crying]
- You should paint her teeny

615
00:24:44,793 --> 00:24:46,174
little fingernails.
- I know, I want to.

616
00:24:46,277 --> 00:24:47,900
When do they start smiling?

617
00:24:48,003 --> 00:24:49,764
- Not for a long time.

618
00:24:49,867 --> 00:24:50,868
- Hold still, bubba.

619
00:24:50,972 --> 00:24:52,421
Don't cry. Owee.

620
00:24:52,525 --> 00:24:53,388
Ugh.

621
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,528
- [crying]
- What are you doing?

622
00:24:55,632 --> 00:24:58,220
But nothing about my life is
normal anymore.

623
00:25:00,084 --> 00:25:04,813
- [crying]
- The baby stays up all night.

624
00:25:04,917 --> 00:25:06,677
Can you go to sleep, please?

625
00:25:06,781 --> 00:25:07,782
I'm tired.

626
00:25:07,885 --> 00:25:09,508
- You're not tired.
You took a nap.

627
00:25:09,611 --> 00:25:12,165
- I'm so tired.

628
00:25:12,269 --> 00:25:14,098
Do you think I'm lying about
being tired?

629
00:25:14,202 --> 00:25:15,134
- Well, it doesn't matter.

630
00:25:15,237 --> 00:25:16,618
You get used to it.

631
00:25:16,722 --> 00:25:18,931
- It seems like I'm never going
to get a break.

632
00:25:19,034 --> 00:25:21,934
- [crying]
- Especially since Adam's never

633
00:25:22,037 --> 00:25:23,591
around.

634
00:25:23,694 --> 00:25:25,040
- Hey, time to get up.

635
00:25:25,144 --> 00:25:28,596
It's 2 o'clock in the afternoon.

636
00:25:30,805 --> 00:25:33,532
- What the hell?

637
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:38,433
[sighs]

638
00:25:41,781 --> 00:25:43,645
- I'll get on that.

639
00:25:47,131 --> 00:25:51,308
[door slams]
- I think your mommy's grumpy.

640
00:25:51,411 --> 00:25:53,517
- I can't even think about
going back to school.

641
00:25:53,621 --> 00:25:57,072
And to be honest, I'm not sure I
even care.

642
00:26:01,111 --> 00:26:05,633
- [crying]
- What's the matter?

643
00:26:07,876 --> 00:26:09,947
She's so sick.

644
00:26:10,051 --> 00:26:12,778
Are you going to go to
the doctor today?

645
00:26:12,881 --> 00:26:15,090
Yeah.

646
00:26:15,194 --> 00:26:16,575
Aubrey's breathing funny.

647
00:26:16,678 --> 00:26:19,716
The doctor thinks that she has
RSV, a respiratory virus

648
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:21,372
that preemies are at risk for.

649
00:26:21,476 --> 00:26:23,651
So I'm taking her in to get
checked out, and I'm hoping

650
00:26:23,754 --> 00:26:26,619
Adam will come.

651
00:26:26,723 --> 00:26:30,312
But not surprisingly,
I can't reach him.

652
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:36,940
Hi.
- How are you?

653
00:26:37,043 --> 00:26:38,493
- Good, how are you?
- Good.

654
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:42,324
Should we take a look at her?

655
00:26:42,428 --> 00:26:44,948
Sometimes RSV just causes the
cold symptoms and the stuffy

656
00:26:45,051 --> 00:26:48,503
nose, and again, sometimes
there's issues with the lungs.

657
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,851
So we'll listen and see what she
sounds like.

658
00:26:51,955 --> 00:26:55,475
[phone vibrates]
- Hello?

659
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,341
- I was just going to see if
you were going to come to her

660
00:26:59,445 --> 00:27:00,722
doctor's appointment with me.

661
00:27:01,930 --> 00:27:05,693
- Well, yeah, "probably not"
because I'm already here.

662
00:27:08,143 --> 00:27:10,594
- Okay, bye.

663
00:27:10,698 --> 00:27:13,597
- Um, in the lungs I do hear
just a few little wheezes.

664
00:27:13,701 --> 00:27:16,013
We have to watch that pretty
closely.

665
00:27:16,117 --> 00:27:18,153
- Would she have to stay in the
hospital at all for this?

666
00:27:18,257 --> 00:27:19,568
- If it got bad, yes.

667
00:27:19,672 --> 00:27:20,811
- Okay.

668
00:27:20,915 --> 00:27:25,160
- If she starts breathing
really fast, um, or hard,

669
00:27:25,264 --> 00:27:27,128
then she needs to be seen again.

670
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:28,232
Yep, yep.

671
00:27:28,336 --> 00:27:31,684
- [coughs]
- You okay?

672
00:27:31,788 --> 00:27:34,756
Yeah.

673
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,448
- [coughs]

674
00:27:37,552 --> 00:27:39,278
- Adam's showing no concern for
Aubrey's health.

675
00:27:39,381 --> 00:27:42,764
I know I have to confront him.

676
00:27:42,868 --> 00:27:46,181
Adam is coming, and I'm, like,
scared.

677
00:27:46,285 --> 00:27:47,217
- Why are you scared?

678
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:48,805
- I don't know.

679
00:27:48,908 --> 00:27:51,704
Because I want to bring up how
he, like, doesn't come around

680
00:27:51,808 --> 00:27:53,913
when she--
like, she was sick, and he just

681
00:27:54,017 --> 00:27:54,880
said he didn't want to come.

682
00:27:54,983 --> 00:27:57,296
And it's not--it's
not an option.

683
00:27:57,399 --> 00:28:00,402
And he just doesn't come around
for, like, the important things.

684
00:28:00,506 --> 00:28:02,335
He wasn't there when she came
home.

685
00:28:02,439 --> 00:28:05,235
He doesn't come to her doctor's
appointments.

686
00:28:05,338 --> 00:28:07,340
- When is he there?
Just randomly?

687
00:28:07,444 --> 00:28:09,204
- When I go to him.

688
00:28:09,308 --> 00:28:11,413
- Do you ask him what he wants?
- Yeah.

689
00:28:11,517 --> 00:28:13,139
"I want you to not be dumb."

690
00:28:13,243 --> 00:28:14,693
but I don't know what that
means.

691
00:28:14,796 --> 00:28:16,487
Like, I don't know how I'm being
dumb.

692
00:28:16,591 --> 00:28:18,386
Like, I'm "being dumb" because I
want to hang out with him

693
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:20,008
and because I want him to come
help.

694
00:28:20,112 --> 00:28:21,251
- But that's not being dumb.

695
00:28:21,354 --> 00:28:22,390
- I know it's not.

696
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:24,530
- He shouldn't even say that.

697
00:28:24,633 --> 00:28:26,428

- I just really need someone to
be home.

872
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,364
Please come home.

873
00:35:59,467 --> 00:36:01,918
- Okay.

874
00:36:11,583 --> 00:36:14,586
- I need my dad to come home
because I feel totally destroyed

875
00:36:14,689 --> 00:36:18,314
after Adam's hateful text.

876
00:36:18,417 --> 00:36:20,833
- Hey.

877
00:36:20,937 --> 00:36:23,353
What's all going on?

878
00:36:23,457 --> 00:36:25,976
- He, like, says mean things
to me which, like, hurts my

879
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,254
feelings.

880
00:36:27,357 --> 00:36:29,532
But when he said that about her,
that was different.

881
00:36:29,635 --> 00:36:32,535
I think it's sinking in that
he's mean.

882
00:36:32,638 --> 00:36:36,608
Like, when he said that he wants
to sign over his rights to

883
00:36:36,711 --> 00:36:37,954
"that mistake."

884
00:36:38,057 --> 00:36:39,542
- How does that make you feel?

885
00:36:39,645 --> 00:36:41,854
- Makes me feel way worse
than when he tells me anything.

886
00:36:41,958 --> 00:36:43,235
- You know why?

887
00:36:43,339 --> 00:36:46,100
- Because she's--
- Because now you're the adult

888
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:49,552
and you're seeing him say and
pick on somebody who has no

889
00:36:49,655 --> 00:36:51,001
defense.

890
00:36:51,105 --> 00:36:53,211
- Yeah, she didn't do anything
wrong.

891
00:36:53,314 --> 00:36:56,869
- You have to start using his
meanness as your motivation

892
00:36:56,973 --> 00:36:58,112
to get out of this.

893
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,321
- I think we need to change
her last name.

894
00:37:00,425 --> 00:37:04,877
- He's done nothing to deserve
to have his name carry on.

895
00:37:13,438 --> 00:37:15,129
- I don't feel nervous, and I
don't feel sad.

896
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,718
I feel like changing her name
is, like,

897
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:19,720
what I'm supposed to do.
- Yeah.

898
00:37:19,823 --> 00:37:21,515
- I'm over, like, being sad.

899
00:37:27,072 --> 00:37:29,350
- Are we here today to talk
about a name change maybe?

900
00:37:29,454 --> 00:37:30,696
- Yes.

901
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,181
- How did the current name
become the baby's last name?

902
00:37:33,285 --> 00:37:36,081
- He kind of, like, talked me
into it.

903
00:37:36,184 --> 00:37:38,256
- This has been a yo-yo
relationship.

904
00:37:38,359 --> 00:37:39,429
- Okay.

905
00:37:39,533 --> 00:37:41,500
When was the last time that this
was on again?

906
00:37:41,604 --> 00:37:43,295
- A week ago. Two weeks ago.

907
00:37:43,399 --> 00:37:46,125
It's been, like, off and on
so many times.

908
00:37:46,229 --> 00:37:48,680
- So is there a chance that you
may change your mind?

909
00:37:48,783 --> 00:37:51,061
- No. Not about her name.

910
00:37:51,165 --> 00:37:54,064
- When Aubrey starts school
someday, you want her to have

911
00:37:54,168 --> 00:37:55,687
the same last name as you.

912
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:56,860
- Mm-hmm.

913
00:37:56,964 --> 00:37:59,656
- Is that, like, your top
reason or--

914
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,795
- There's a lot of reasons.

915
00:38:00,899 --> 00:38:02,349
That's, like, a big one.

916
00:38:02,452 --> 00:38:03,246
- Okay.

917
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:04,454
Megan, I have a question
for you.

918
00:38:04,558 --> 00:38:07,423
Are Chelsea's motives good,
in your opinion?

919
00:38:07,526 --> 00:38:08,734
- Absolutely.

920
00:38:08,838 --> 00:38:10,391
- I mean, is she doing this
for the best interests of

921
00:38:10,495 --> 00:38:11,599
Aubrey?
- Mm-hmm.

922
00:38:11,703 --> 00:38:13,083
- Okay.

923
00:38:13,187 --> 00:38:15,741
- I know closing this chapter
with Adam will be hard,

924
00:38:15,845 --> 00:38:18,365
but I'm doing it for Aubrey.

925
00:38:25,717 --> 00:38:27,201
- What are you doing?

926
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,616
- Smile.

927
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:30,446
With Adam out of the picture,
it's time to focus on moving

928
00:38:30,549 --> 00:38:31,481
forward.

929
00:38:31,585 --> 00:38:32,724
- All right, guess who I talked
to.

930
00:38:32,827 --> 00:38:34,691
- Who?
- School.

931
00:38:34,795 --> 00:38:36,797
They're giving you a break.

932
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:38,799
So you're going to take care
of it.

933
00:38:38,902 --> 00:38:40,559
You can finish and you can
graduate.

934
00:38:40,663 --> 00:38:43,321
- They said that? How?

935
00:38:43,424 --> 00:38:45,184
- By not missing anymore
and getting the work done.

936
00:38:45,288 --> 00:38:46,876
- Were they mean about it?

937
00:38:46,979 --> 00:38:48,533
- No, they want you to
graduate.

938
00:38:48,636 --> 00:38:50,673
Otherwise, they wouldn't be
bending over backwards for you.

939
00:38:50,776 --> 00:38:53,227
- So I just need to, like, make
up what I missed

940
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:54,608
and then it's cool?

941
00:38:54,711 --> 00:38:55,919
- Yeah.

942
00:38:56,023 --> 00:38:59,371
Just make up what you missed
and go to class.

943
00:38:59,475 --> 00:39:01,856
- Honestly, like, I know it's a
big deal, but, like, that's just

944
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,237
not what I think about.

945
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,343
- Well, it should be.
- I know.

946
00:39:05,446 --> 00:39:07,828
I know it's what I should be,
but it's not.

947
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:09,933
- Ideally, it would have been
great if you'd have graduated

948
00:39:10,037 --> 00:39:11,625
at semester time.
- Okay, sorry.

949
00:39:11,728 --> 00:39:14,421
I'm not an overachiever.

950
00:39:14,524 --> 00:39:16,561
- It's just,
I want an achiever.

951
00:39:16,664 --> 00:39:18,286
- Dad!

952
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:20,150
- I'm not being greedy.

953
00:39:20,254 --> 00:39:22,912
- I achieved a baby.

954
00:39:23,015 --> 00:39:24,189
A pretty cute one.

955
00:39:24,292 --> 00:39:27,365
- I want you to achieve
a diploma.

956
00:39:37,305 --> 00:39:39,687
- We need more formula.

957
00:39:39,791 --> 00:39:43,691
Before I found out I was
pregnant, I didn't really have

958
00:39:43,795 --> 00:39:45,900
a care in the world.

959
00:39:46,004 --> 00:39:50,388
And then I found out I was
pregnant and everything changed.

960
00:39:52,769 --> 00:39:53,874
- [together] Hi.

961
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:55,220
- Hey, little peanut.

962
00:39:55,323 --> 00:39:58,361
- First, Adam was really
supportive and nice.

963
00:39:58,465 --> 00:40:01,778
But the reality is, he's just
not ready for this,

964
00:40:01,882 --> 00:40:04,747
and he's not ready to grow up
and take responsibility.

965
00:40:04,850 --> 00:40:07,715
He's not ready to get a job
and be a little family,

966
00:40:07,819 --> 00:40:10,062
which is sad because that's what
I wanted.

967
00:40:10,166 --> 00:40:14,239
I'm working on trying to make
the best decisions that are for

968
00:40:14,342 --> 00:40:16,517
me and for Aubrey.

969
00:40:16,621 --> 00:40:18,312
No, I do want to graduate.

970
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,245
It's just harder than I thought.

971
00:40:20,348 --> 00:40:21,867
But I want to graduate.

972
00:40:21,971 --> 00:40:23,731
- You will.
- I want to.

973
00:40:23,835 --> 00:40:25,457
- You will.

974
00:40:25,561 --> 00:40:31,429
- As of right now, I'm getting
incompletes in all of my

975
00:40:31,532 --> 00:40:35,433
classes, and I'm not sure
if I'm going to be able to fix

976
00:40:35,536 --> 00:40:39,920
this, but I, like, I want to.

977
00:40:40,023 --> 00:40:42,025
I don't know all the answers.

978
00:40:42,129 --> 00:40:43,199
What's the matter?

979
00:40:43,302 --> 00:40:46,789
Are you having a bad dream?

980
00:40:46,892 --> 00:40:49,239
I'm just trying to figure out
what the right thing to do is

981
00:40:49,343 --> 00:40:51,034
for me and my daughter.

982
00:40:51,138 --> 00:40:53,036
[chime dings]

- Female announcer: on the next 
16 and pregnant...

984
00:41:06,947 --> 00:41:08,880
- This is the only
blood-related family I have.

985
00:41:08,983 --> 00:41:10,675
And now everyone's making me
give him to somebody else.

986
00:41:10,778 --> 00:41:12,090
Let them raise him.

987
00:41:12,193 --> 00:41:15,542
- It would be such a mistake
for you and for this baby

988
00:41:15,645 --> 00:41:17,992
to bring him into this house.

989
00:41:18,096 --> 00:41:20,823
- I have my final answer,
whether they like it or not.

990
00:41:20,926 --> 00:41:21,927
I'm keeping him.

991
00:41:22,031 --> 00:41:24,620
- Why are we playing these
games, Lori?

992
00:41:24,723 --> 00:41:26,587
- I'm not really not decided
yet.

993
00:41:26,691 --> 00:41:29,107
- I'm just at, like, wit's end.

994

- She's been causing problems
since day one.

995
00:41:31,247 --> 00:41:32,110
