1
00:00:03,671 --> 00:00:05,005
>> I'M MEGAN.

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:05,673
[grunts]

3
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:06,907
IT'S GETTING A LITTLE BIT

4
00:00:06,907 --> 00:00:07,675
BETTER.

5
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:08,876
I'M A HIGH SCHOOL JUNIOR

6
00:00:08,876 --> 00:00:10,178
FROM AULT, COLORADO.

7
00:00:10,178 --> 00:00:11,412
I'VE NEVER BEEN OUTSIDE

8
00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:12,813
OUR TINY TOWN, SO I'M REALLY

9
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:13,947
EXCITED TO GO TO COLLEGE

10
00:00:13,947 --> 00:00:15,716
AND SEE WHAT ELSE IS OUT THERE.

11
00:00:15,716 --> 00:00:17,385
I'M 16 YEARS OLD AND THE BABY

12
00:00:17,385 --> 00:00:18,386
OF THE FAMILY.

13
00:00:18,386 --> 00:00:19,687
IT TASTES FUNNY.

14
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:20,888
>> WELL, YOU WANT CEREAL?

15
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:21,555
>> NO.

16
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:22,623
>> YOU WANT PANCAKES?

17
00:00:22,623 --> 00:00:23,357
>> NO.

18
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:24,292
>> YOU WANT EGGS?

19
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:25,293
>> MM, NO.

20
00:00:25,293 --> 00:00:26,627
MY DAD AND MY SISTER ARE BOTH

21
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:28,129
IN THE MILITARY, SO THEY'RE ONLY

22
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:29,463
HOME A FEW MONTHS OF THE YEAR.

23
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:30,298
>> HI.

24
00:00:30,298 --> 00:00:31,299
>> I LOOK UP TO MY SISTER

25
00:00:31,299 --> 00:00:33,101
MORE THAN ANYONE IN THE WORLD.

26
00:00:33,101 --> 00:00:34,268
>> YOU'RE SO PRETTY.

27
00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:35,103
>> SO IT REALLY SUCKS

28
00:00:35,103 --> 00:00:36,537
WHEN SHE'S NOT HERE.

29
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:37,538
MOST OF THE TIME, IT'S JUST

30
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:39,373
ME AND MY MOM IN THE HOUSE.

31
00:00:39,373 --> 00:00:40,374
OR AT LEAST IT WAS,

32
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:41,875
UNTIL I MET MY FIRST BOYFRIEND

33
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,244
AND THE LOVE OF MY LIFE,

34
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:44,912
NATHAN.

35
00:00:44,912 --> 00:00:45,679
>> YOU'RE A BAD-ASS.

36
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:46,580
>> I KNOW.

37
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,915
NATHAN WAS A BIG PARTIER,

38
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:49,417
BUT ONCE HE MET ME,

39
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:50,918
HE SETTLED DOWN.

40
00:00:50,918 --> 00:00:52,086
HE GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL

41
00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:53,587
LAST YEAR AND HASN'T GOTTEN

42
00:00:53,587 --> 00:00:55,256
A JOB, SO INSTEAD, HE PLAYS

43
00:00:55,256 --> 00:00:57,758
VIDEO GAMES AND VIDEO GAMES

44
00:00:57,758 --> 00:00:59,393
AND VIDEO GAMES.

45
00:00:59,393 --> 00:01:00,228
HE FIGHTS WITH HIS PARENTS

46
00:01:00,228 --> 00:01:01,729
A LOT ABOUT IT, SO MY MOM LET

47
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:04,031
HIM AND HIS VIDEO GAMES MOVE IN

48
00:01:04,031 --> 00:01:04,832
WITH US.

49
00:01:04,832 --> 00:01:05,833
MY DAD WAS AGAINST NATHAN

50
00:01:05,833 --> 00:01:07,168
MOVING IN, BUT SINCE HE WAS

51
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:09,170
IN AFGHANISTAN AT THE TIME,

52
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:10,304
IT HAPPENED ANYWAY.

53
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:11,439
>> STOP THAT.

54
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,306
>> NOW THAT HE'S BACK,

55
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:13,607
HE THINKS NATHAN SHOULD GET UP

56
00:01:13,607 --> 00:01:15,943
OFF OUR COUCH AND GO GET A JOB,

57
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:17,945
ESPECIALLY NOW, BECAUSE...

58
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:18,779
[chime dings]

59
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:20,714
I'M PREGNANT.

60
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:29,957
WHEN I LOOK AT MY BELLY,

61
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:31,125
IT'S SOMETIMES STILL HARD

62
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:32,426
TO BELIEVE, BUT NATHAN AND I

63
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,128
HAVE HAD SOME TIME TO GET USED

64
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:35,163
TO THE IDEA.

65
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:36,096
>> SO WHAT NAMES DO YOU LIKE

66
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,432
NOW THAT WE KNOW IT'S A BOY?

67
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:41,769
>> UM, I LIKE BLAKE.

68
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,837
AND ETHAN'S KIND OF CUTE.

69
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:45,173
>> ETHAN?

70
00:01:45,173 --> 00:01:46,340
>> YEAH.

71
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,341
>> I DO LIKE BLAKE.

72
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:48,576
I THINK BLAKE'S THE BEST ONE

73
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:49,243
SO FAR.

74
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:50,244
>> YEAH.

75
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:51,745
HOPEFULLY HE'S OUTGOING LIKE YOU

76
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:54,548
AND NOT SHY LIKE ME.

77
00:01:54,548 --> 00:01:55,716
>> WELL, WE ARE, WHAT,

78
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:56,717
THREE YEARS APART?

79
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:58,051
>> THREE YEARS, THREE MONTHS.

80
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,887
>> AND YOU'RE PRETTY IMMATURE

81
00:01:59,887 --> 00:02:00,554
STILL.

82
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:01,289
>> [laughs]

83
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:02,022
>> THAT'S FOR SURE.

84
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:03,891
>> NO, I JUST HAVE A CHILDISH

85
00:02:03,891 --> 00:02:04,558
SIDE.

86
00:02:04,558 --> 00:02:05,326
>> YOU'RE STILL JUST

87
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:05,993
A LITTLE KID, YEAH.

88
00:02:05,993 --> 00:02:06,894
>> WHICH MEANS I'LL HAVE MORE

89
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:07,595
FUN WITH THE BABE.

90
00:02:07,595 --> 00:02:08,529
>> YOU'RE A 5-YEAR-OLD TRAPPED

91
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:11,332
IN A 16-YEAR-OLD'S BODY.

92
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:12,566
>> YOU ARE A JERK.

93
00:02:12,566 --> 00:02:13,301
>> YEAH.

94
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:14,235
>> THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH

95
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:14,902
19-YEAR-OLDS.

96
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:17,405
[laughter]

97
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:18,906
I'M GLAD NATHAN AND I CAN JOKE

98
00:02:18,906 --> 00:02:21,175
AROUND ABOUT BEING SO YOUNG,

99
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:22,176
BUT MY DAD JUST GOT BACK FROM

100
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:23,477
OVERSEAS, AND HE DOES NOT

101
00:02:23,477 --> 00:02:25,979
THINK THIS IS A LAUGHING MATTER.

102
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,315
>> SHE SENT ME A FRICKIN' EMAIL

103
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:28,316
AFTER I WAS ALREADY BACK

104
00:02:28,316 --> 00:02:29,650
IN IRAQ.

105
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,618
>> IT WAS YOUR MOM'S IDEA.

106
00:02:30,618 --> 00:02:31,985
>> YOU KNOW, I OPENED IT UP,

107
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:34,488
AND I WAS...

108
00:02:34,488 --> 00:02:36,123
FRICKIN' TRUTHFULLY

109
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:36,957
BROKENHEARTED.

110
00:02:36,957 --> 00:02:38,326
>> WELL, I WAS EVEN WORRIED TOO,

111
00:02:38,326 --> 00:02:39,360
'CAUSE YOU LEFT, AND SHE DIDN'T

112
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,127
HAVE A BELLY.

113
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:40,828
YOU COME HOME, AND SHE

114
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:41,462
HAS A BELLY.

115
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:42,463
SO I WAS AFRAID THAT WOULD

116
00:02:42,463 --> 00:02:43,130
TRIGGER--

117
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,198
>> IT'S CUTE.

118
00:02:44,198 --> 00:02:45,366
>> IT'S NOT CUTE.

119
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:47,201
IT'S HEARTBREAKING.

120
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:48,336
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST SO

121
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:50,771
DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

122
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:53,374
YOU GUYS CAN'T BE KIDS ANYMORE.

123
00:02:53,374 --> 00:02:55,108
YOU KNOW, YOU GOT TO MAN UP.

124
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:56,744
YOU GOT TO GROW UP.

125
00:02:56,744 --> 00:02:59,747
>> I TOOK IT OKAY,

126
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:01,315
BECAUSE I HAD TO.

127
00:03:01,315 --> 00:03:02,316
>> I KNOW, AND WE'RE GONNA

128
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:05,486
DEAL WITH IT.

129
00:03:05,486 --> 00:03:09,490
DOESN'T MEAN WE HAVE TO LIKE IT.

130
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,858
>> I WISH MY DAD WERE MORE

131
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,192
APPROVING, BUT HE'S BARELY BEEN

132
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:14,027
HOME IN THE PAST YEAR, SO HE

133
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,028
HASN'T HAD TIME TO SEE WHAT

134
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:16,297
I SEE IN NATHAN.

135
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:17,298
>> IMAGINE WHERE WE'D BE IF WE

136
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:18,332
DIDN'T--IF WE WEREN'T GONNA HAVE

137
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:19,433
A BABY.

138
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:20,301
>> NOT STANDING IN

139
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:21,602
A BABY'S ROOM.

140
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:22,436
>> WELL, THIS WOULDN'T BE

141
00:03:22,436 --> 00:03:23,136
THE BABY'S ROOM.

142
00:03:23,136 --> 00:03:23,904
THIS WOULD STILL BE WHERE

143
00:03:23,904 --> 00:03:24,672
OUR BED AND STUFF WAS.

144
00:03:24,672 --> 00:03:25,839
>> YEAH, YOU PROBABLY

145
00:03:25,839 --> 00:03:27,341
WOULDN'T LIVE HERE.

146
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:29,310
>> YEAH.

147
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,012
I'D BE LOST SOMEWHERE.

148
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:33,781
>> PARTYING.

149
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:35,483
>> YOU THINK I STOPPED, THOUGH?

150
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:37,818
>> YEAH, YOU WERE A BAD KID.

151
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:38,986
NATHAN USED TO SPEND ALL HIS

152
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:40,821
TIME PARTYING WITH HIS FRIENDS,

153
00:03:40,821 --> 00:03:41,989
BUT NOW THAT I'M PREGNANT,

154
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:43,491
HE HAS TO GIVE THAT ALL UP.

155
00:03:43,491 --> 00:03:45,025
I THINK HE WILL STEP UP,

156
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,193
BUT MY FRIENDS TEND TO AGREE

157
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:47,528
WITH MY DAD.

158
00:03:47,528 --> 00:03:48,362
>> YOU KNOW HOW I FELT

159
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:49,530
ABOUT YOU AND NATHAN

160
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,098
ALL THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL,

161
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:52,099
AND I NEVER REALLY LIKED IT

162
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:54,101
'CAUSE I THOUGHT--I JUST--

163
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:55,603
I THOUGHT IT WAS BAD NEWS.

164
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:56,437
>> YOU ALWAYS SAID I COULD

165
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:57,938
DO BETTER.

166
00:03:57,938 --> 00:03:59,440
>> SO HOW DID YOU REACT?

167
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,441
LIKE, HOW DID YOU FEEL WHEN

168
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:01,642
YOU FOUND OUT?

169
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:06,079
>> I CRIED, AND I WAS SCARED.

170
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:07,080
>> OOH.

171
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:07,915
>> ISN'T THAT CUTE?

172
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:08,916
>> I'M SO HAPPY IT'S A BOY.

173
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,018
THEIR CLOTHES ARE CUTER.

174
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:11,985
>> [laughs]

175
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:12,653
>> HAVE YOU THOUGHT

176
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:13,654
OF ANY NAMES?

177
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:14,822
>> YEAH, WE'VE THOUGHT OF

178
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:15,823
A COUPLE.

179
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:18,326
WE REALLY LIKE THE NAME BLAKE.

180
00:04:18,326 --> 00:04:19,427
>> SO WHAT HAPPENED WITH

181
00:04:19,427 --> 00:04:20,994
THE BIRTH CONTROL?

182
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:22,496
>> IT GOT CANCELED OUT

183
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:25,065
BY SOME ANTIBIOTICS I WAS ON.

184
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:26,334
>> OH...

185
00:04:26,334 --> 00:04:27,501
DID YOU EVER CONSIDER

186
00:04:27,501 --> 00:04:28,902
ALTERNATIVES?

187
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:29,737
>> WE HAD TALKED ABOUT THEM,

188
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:31,405
BUT I KNEW FROM THE, LIKE,

189
00:04:31,405 --> 00:04:32,906
BEGINNING THAT I WANTED

190
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:34,074
TO KEEP IT.

191
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:34,875
>> IT'S JUST, LIKE, YOUR

192
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,177
TEENAGE YEARS ARE OVER.

193
00:04:37,177 --> 00:04:38,512
WHAT KIND OF DAD DO YOU THINK

194
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:40,314
NATHAN WILL BE?

195
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:41,349
>> I DON'T KNOW.

196
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:42,516
I WANT TO BELIEVE HE'LL BE

197
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:44,184
A GOOD DAD, BUT IT'S HARD WHEN

198
00:04:44,184 --> 00:04:46,019
EVERYONE ELSE HAS SO MUCH DOUBT,

199
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:48,889
ESPECIALLY MY SISTER.

200
00:04:48,889 --> 00:04:50,891
>> IF MOM HADN'T LET NATHAN

201
00:04:50,891 --> 00:04:52,726
LIVE IN OUR HOUSE, YOU'D STILL

202
00:04:52,726 --> 00:04:54,328
BE A SWEET LITTLE INNOCENT GIRL,

203
00:04:54,328 --> 00:04:55,162
AND YOUR LIFE WOULDN'T BE

204
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:55,729
RUINED.

205
00:04:55,729 --> 00:04:56,564
>> I STILL AM SWEET AND

206
00:04:56,564 --> 00:04:57,565
INNOCENT.

207
00:04:57,565 --> 00:04:58,899
>> BEFORE, YOU COULD HAVE DONE,

208
00:04:58,899 --> 00:05:00,067
LIKE, ANYTHING,

209
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:02,269
ANYTHING IN THE ENTIRE WORLD.

210
00:05:02,269 --> 00:05:04,071
NOW YOU ARE VERY, VERY LIMITED.

211
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:04,905
YOU THINK YOU CAN GO TO

212
00:05:04,905 --> 00:05:06,273
A REGULAR COLLEGE?

213
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:07,074
>> YEAH.

214
00:05:07,074 --> 00:05:08,576
>> YOU GOT A KID.

215
00:05:08,576 --> 00:05:10,277
DO YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS?

216
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:11,579
>> YEAH.

217
00:05:11,579 --> 00:05:13,414

219
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:16,750
I KNOW SHE CAN DO IT.

220

>> I'M JUST SAYING, I WANT

221
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:20,153
NOTHING MORE THAN TO HAVE HER

222
00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,755
DO WELL.

223
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:23,424
STATISTICS ARE AGAINST HER.

224
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:24,825
>> YES, THEY ARE.

225
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,994
>> IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY.

226
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:28,195
>> I KNOW.

227
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:29,697
>> I THINK ONCE THE BABY COMES

228
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:31,031
AND THINGS START GETTING ROUGH,

229
00:05:31,031 --> 00:05:35,068
NATHAN'S GONNA SPLIT.

230
00:05:35,068 --> 00:05:35,903
NOW YOU'RE NOT GONNA TALK

231
00:05:35,903 --> 00:05:36,537
TO ME, ARE YOU?

232
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:38,038
>> I JUST HAVE NOTHING TO SAY.

233
00:05:38,038 --> 00:05:39,873
I REALLY LOOK UP TO MY SISTER,

234
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:41,375
SO IT KILLS ME THAT SHE FEELS

235
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,043
THIS WAY.

236
00:05:43,043 --> 00:05:45,078
I REALLY HOPE NATHAN STEPS UP

237
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,580
AND PROVES HER AND EVERYBODY

238
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,948
ELSE WRONG.

AND TONIGHT'S MY VERY FIRST

242
00:05:57,491 --> 00:05:58,659
HOMECOMING DANCE.

243
00:05:58,659 --> 00:05:59,660
SINCE I'M ONLY GOING TO BE

244
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,328
IN SCHOOL ANOTHER SIX WEEKS

245
00:06:01,328 --> 00:06:03,163
BEFORE THE BABY COMES, IT MEANS

246
00:06:03,163 --> 00:06:04,665
A LOT TO ME TO BE ABLE TO GO.

247
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:05,499
AND EVEN THOUGH HE ALREADY

248
00:06:05,499 --> 00:06:07,167
GRADUATED, I'M GLAD NATHAN'S

249
00:06:07,167 --> 00:06:08,502
COMING WITH ME.

250
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:09,503
>> HEY, BABY, YOU ALMOST DONE?

251
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:10,904
>> YEAH, ALMOST.

252
00:06:10,904 --> 00:06:12,072

00:06:12,072 --> 00:06:13,240
>> GET DRESSED.

WHOO!

257
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:19,547
>> DAMN.

258
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:20,380
LOOK AT THAT.

>> I LOOK HUGE.

262
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,383
>> I THINK YOU GET BIGGER

263
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,251
EVERY DAY.

264
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:26,253
>> I THINK I DO TOO.

265
00:06:26,253 --> 00:06:27,655
>> LOOK AT ME, EVERYBODY.

266
00:06:27,655 --> 00:06:29,356
>> I WAS PLAYING WITH MY HAIR.

267
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:30,691
>> YOU ARE SUCH A BRAT.

>> BYE!

>> SEE YA.

>> OKAY, AND NOW THE NEXT ONE

272
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:40,834
CAN BE SILLY.

273
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:42,335
>> BEING AT HOMECOMING MAKES ME

274
00:06:42,335 --> 00:06:43,336
FEEL LIKE A NORMAL TEENAGER

275
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:44,838
AGAIN, AND NATHAN AND I HAD

276
00:06:44,838 --> 00:06:48,676
A BLAST.

277
00:06:48,676 --> 00:06:50,343
BUT THE NEXT DAY, REALITY

278
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:51,845
SANK IN WHEN MY DAD WANTED

279
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,681
TO TALK TO US ABOUT THE FUTURE

280
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:54,682
BEFORE HE RETURNED TO

281
00:06:54,682 --> 00:06:56,049
AFGHANISTAN.

282
00:06:56,049 --> 00:06:58,185
>> SO WHAT'S THE PLAN?

283
00:06:58,185 --> 00:06:59,186
>> WHAT PLAN?

284
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:00,721
>> WHAT ARE YOU GUYS GONNA DO?

285
00:07:00,721 --> 00:07:01,622
>> YOU GONNA GET MARRIED?

286
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:02,389
ARE YOU GONNA...

>> ONE DAY.

>> I'M TALKING WORK.

290

>> I KNOW, I...

291
00:07:08,796 --> 00:07:09,797
I NEED TO LOOK EVEN HARDER

292
00:07:09,797 --> 00:07:11,632
THAN I AM.

293
00:07:11,632 --> 00:07:14,301
I JUST DON'T WANT TO SETTLE FOR

294
00:07:14,301 --> 00:07:15,469
A FAST-FOOD JOB.

295
00:07:15,469 --> 00:07:16,470
>> BUT IT'S ALWAYS EASIER TO

296
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,938
FIND A JOB WHEN YOU HAVE A JOB.

297
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:18,939

298
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:19,973
WHEN YOU HAVE A JOB.

299
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:21,809
>> I WANT YOU GUYS TO BE ABLE

300
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:23,043
TO STAND ON YOUR OWN TWO FEET

301
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:24,211
TOO, BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FEEL

302
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:27,715
GOOD TO HAVE TO RELY ON SOMEBODY

303
00:07:27,715 --> 00:07:30,217
ELSE FOR EVERYTHING.

304
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:33,053
>> I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO RELY

305
00:07:33,053 --> 00:07:36,056
ON YOU GUYS FOR A HOUSE AND FOOD

306
00:07:36,056 --> 00:07:38,592
AND STUFF, BUT IT'S NICE

307
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:39,392
TO HAVE IT.

308
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:40,227
[laughs]

309
00:07:40,227 --> 00:07:41,695
>> OH, THERE'S A SHOT CLOCK.

310
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:42,696
>> HE MEANS YOU CAN'T LIVE WITH

311
00:07:42,696 --> 00:07:43,697
US FOREVER.

312
00:07:43,697 --> 00:07:45,432
>> OH, I KNOW.

313
00:07:45,432 --> 00:07:46,600
>> HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT GOING

314
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,235
INTO THE AIR FORCE?

315

>> BUT...

316
00:07:48,902 --> 00:07:49,670
>> BUT HE DOESN'T WANT

317
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,237
TO BE AWAY.

318
00:07:50,237 --> 00:07:52,139
>> YEAH, WITH A NEW BABY.

319

>> YOU DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO.

323
00:07:56,977 --> 00:07:58,145
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, I USED TO SAY

324
00:07:58,145 --> 00:07:59,146
THE SAME THING.

325
00:07:59,146 --> 00:07:59,980
I'M NOT GONNA DO THIS.

326
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,981
I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT.

332
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,427
A JOB IN THE ARMY TOO,

333
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:18,632

00:08:19,767 --> 00:08:20,433

DIDN'T WASTE ANY TIME GETTING

346
00:08:40,253 --> 00:08:42,255
BACK TO HIS FAVORITE CHAIR.

354

>> WHY?

356
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,477
>> BECAUSE IT'S NOT GONNA BE

357
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,313
EASY TO TAKE CARE OF A BABY

OUT.

I JUST FEEL LIKE ANYTHING

00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:42,015
>> I DON'T WANT TO DO IT, NO.

378
00:09:42,015 --> 00:09:43,016
>> LIKE, YOU DON'T WANT TO

379
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:43,851
BE DEPLOYED OR ANYTHING?

380
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:46,019
>> NO, LIKE, I'M NOT

381
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:47,120
A GUN PERSON.

382
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,623
I THINK THE HARDEST THING FOR ME

383
00:09:49,623 --> 00:09:51,458
TO GO INTO THE ARMY IS,

384
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:52,292
I DON'T WANT TO MISS OUT

385
00:09:52,292 --> 00:09:54,628
ON ANYTHING.

386
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:56,463
I KNOW IT'S AN OPTION, BUT IT'S

387
00:09:56,463 --> 00:09:59,066
NOT ONE THAT I LIKE.

388
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,440
>> I WAS HOPING NATHAN WOULD

389
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,009
STEP IT UP, BUT OVER THE NEXT

390
00:10:09,009 --> 00:10:10,644
FEW DAYS, INSTEAD OF LOOKING FOR

391
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,646
A JOB, NATHAN CHOSE TO HANG OUT

392
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:13,981
WITH HIS FRIENDS AND PLAY

393
00:10:13,981 --> 00:10:15,148
VIDEO GAMES.

394
00:10:15,148 --> 00:10:16,316
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE

395
00:10:16,316 --> 00:10:19,319
HIS HEAD IS AT ANYMORE.

396
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,324
EVEN THOUGH NATHAN AND I ARE

397
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:25,492
SUPPOSED TO GO TO A HALLOWEEN

398
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:26,994
PARTY AT HIS PARENTS' HOUSE,

399
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:29,296
HE'S ACTING EVEN MORE DISTANT

400
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:30,964
AND SAYING THAT I'M CROWDING HIM

401
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,032
BUT THAT HE MIGHT COME OVER

402
00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:33,200
WHEN HE'S FINISHED PLAYING

403
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,935
VIDEO GAMES WITH HIS FRIENDS.

404
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:37,470
>> YOU ARE A PIRATE MAIDEN.

405
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,372
>> I LOOK DUMB.

406
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,709
>> YOU LOOK SO CUTE.

407
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:43,711
>> YOU'RE NOT TAKING PICTURES.

408
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:44,544
>> I'M NOT?

409
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:45,212
REALLY?

410
00:10:45,212 --> 00:10:46,046
>> REALLY.

411
00:10:46,046 --> 00:10:47,214
>> ARE YOU SURE?

412
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:49,282
'CAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE I AM.

413
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:52,152
>> I'M GONNA HURT HER, SADIE.

414
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:53,486
>> [giggling]

415
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:54,988
>> STOP LAUGHING AT ME.

416
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,791
>> I THINK YOU'RE ADORABLE.

417
00:11:02,229 --> 00:11:03,396
>> THAT LOOKS REALLY GOOD

418
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:04,231
ON YOU.

419
00:11:04,231 --> 00:11:05,065
>> IT DOES.

420
00:11:05,065 --> 00:11:06,734
>> IT WAS THE ONLY NON-SLUTTY

421
00:11:06,734 --> 00:11:07,735
PIRATE COSTUME.

422
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:09,669
>> IT'S SO CUTE.

423
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,941
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE NATHAN

424
00:11:13,941 --> 00:11:16,609
IS STILL NOT HERE.

425
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:23,550
>> DUDE, YOU USED TO RUN WILD

426
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:25,986
EVERYWHERE WITH ME.

427
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,320
YOU WERE, LIKE, THE WILD STEED

428
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,822
THAT DON'T EVER GET CAUGHT,

429
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:31,491
BUT IT'S, YOU KNOW, YOU GOT

430
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:32,692
CAGED IN.

431
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,994
>> I DO FEEL LIKE I'M KIND OF

432
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:34,795
STUCK HERE.

433
00:11:34,795 --> 00:11:38,465
MAN, THIS IS SO STRESSFUL.

434
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:40,067
>> DUDE, YEAH.

435
00:11:40,067 --> 00:11:41,234
YOU JUST NEED TO BE ABLE

436
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:42,736
TO HAVE A LITTLE TIME AWAY.

437
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:44,237
I REALLY THINK THAT MAYBE

438
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:45,638
COMING TO STAY WITH ME,

439
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:48,408
THAT'LL HELP YOU TO COME BACK.

440
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:49,910
>> THAT WILL HELP A LOT.

441
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,913
>> YEAH.

442
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:55,916
>> I DON'T EVEN KNOW ANYMORE.

443
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,084
>> I'M NOT GONNA MAKE ANY

444
00:11:57,084 --> 00:11:58,085
EXCUSES FOR HIM.

445
00:11:58,085 --> 00:12:00,253
>> YEAH.

446
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:03,924
>> AND I KNOW THAT THIS IS

447
00:12:03,924 --> 00:12:06,059
A HUGE CHANGE FOR EVERYBODY.

448
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:09,062
I MEAN, THAT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE

449
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,730
ON YOU, ON HIM.

450
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,398
>> YEAH.

451
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,566
>> I MEAN, HE NEEDS TO REALIZE

452
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:15,568
WHAT HE'S DOING AND WHAT HE'S

453
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,736
DOING TO YOU, BECAUSE IT'S NOT

454
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:19,406
OKAY FOR HIM TO TREAT YOU THAT

455
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:21,008
WAY, IT'S NOT.

456
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:22,342
>> I THINK IT'S JUST...

457
00:12:22,342 --> 00:12:23,176
IT'S ALL JUST STARTING

458
00:12:23,176 --> 00:12:24,177
TO HIT HIM, ESPECIALLY 'CAUSE

459
00:12:24,177 --> 00:12:25,678
IT'S ONLY A FEW MONTHS AWAY.

460
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:26,847
>> IT'S ONLY A FEW MONTHS AWAY.

461
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:27,680
HE DOESN'T HAVE A JOB.

462
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,581
HE DOESN'T REALLY WANT TO GET

463
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,116
A JOB.

464
00:12:29,116 --> 00:12:29,783
>> YEAH.

465
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:30,784
I KNOW ALL THIS CHANGE

466
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:32,685
IS REALLY OVERWHELMING.

467
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:33,453
[chime dings]

468
00:12:33,453 --> 00:12:34,454
MAYBE ALL NATHAN NEEDS

469
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:35,789
IS SOME SUPPORT.

470
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:37,457
I WENT HOME TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT

471
00:12:37,457 --> 00:12:39,126
IT, BUT ALL I FOUND WAS A NOTE

472
00:12:39,126 --> 00:12:40,627
SAYING HE DECIDED TO SPEND THE

473
00:12:40,627 --> 00:12:42,963
WEEKEND AT HIS FRIEND TYLER'S.

474
00:12:42,963 --> 00:12:44,798
TYLER IS NATHAN'S PARTY BUDDY,

475
00:12:44,798 --> 00:12:45,632
WHO HE WOULD HAVE BEEN LIVING

476
00:12:45,632 --> 00:12:46,967
WITH IF I HADN'T GOTTEN

477
00:12:46,967 --> 00:12:48,135
PREGNANT, AND IT MAKES ME

478
00:12:48,135 --> 00:12:49,636
KIND OF NERVOUS, SO I WENT

479
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:51,204
TO TALK TO HIM THERE.

480
00:12:51,204 --> 00:12:52,539
>> YOU KNOW, IF I NEED MY SPACE,

481
00:12:52,539 --> 00:12:53,640
I NEED MY SPACE.

482
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,075
>> I THINK IT'S 'CAUSE BOTH OF

483
00:12:55,075 --> 00:12:57,244
US ARE STARTING TO GET STRESSED

484
00:12:57,244 --> 00:12:59,346
ABOUT THE BABY.

485
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:01,014
A LOT OF TIMES, WHEN I GET UPSET

486
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:03,016
AND STUFF, IT'S 'CAUSE YOU'RE

487
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:07,587
PLAYING YOUR VIDEO GAMES 24/7.

488
00:13:10,690 --> 00:13:12,225
>> SO YOU REALIZE IF WE WEREN'T

489
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:13,093
HAVING A BABY, I WOULDN'T BE

490
00:13:13,093 --> 00:13:18,065
HERE, RIGHT?

491
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:19,399
>> NO.

492
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:22,903
I DID NOT REALIZE THAT.

493
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:25,405
>> AFTER HIGH SCHOOL, I WAS JUST

494
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:26,573
GONNA MOVE TO FORT COLLINS WITH

495
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:29,576
MY FRIENDS, UNTIL I FOUND OUT

496
00:13:29,576 --> 00:13:31,211
YOU WERE PREGNANT.

497
00:13:31,211 --> 00:13:32,045
BUT I WAS PLANNING ON MOVING

498
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:33,746
OUT OF YOUR HOUSE AND LEAVING,

499
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:36,950
UNTIL WE FOUND OUT.

500
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,451
LET'S JUST HOPE YOU DIDN'T

501
00:13:38,451 --> 00:13:42,622
PUSH ME TO THE EDGE.

502
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:44,457
>> I HAD NO IDEA NATHAN FELT

503
00:13:44,457 --> 00:13:45,792
THIS TRAPPED.

504
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:46,793
I'M STARTING TO WONDER IF

505
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:47,961
MY SISTER IS RIGHT ABOUT

506
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:50,230
HIM NOT STICKING AROUND.

507
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:01,274
>> I COULDN'T BRING MYSELF TO

508
00:14:01,274 --> 00:14:02,709
TELL MY MOM NATHAN SAID HE'S

509
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:04,044
ONLY WITH ME BECAUSE I'M

510
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:05,378
PREGNANT, BUT SHE KNOWS HE'S

511
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:06,546
BEEN STAYING AT HIS FRIEND'S

512
00:14:06,546 --> 00:14:07,915
HOUSE AND THAT I AM TOTALLY

513
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:08,916
DOWN.

514
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,317
>> YOU KNOW I'M HERE,

515
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:11,651
AND YOU KNOW I ALWAYS KNOW

516
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:12,819
WHEN YOU'RE UPSET,

517
00:14:12,819 --> 00:14:13,987
AND I ALWAYS SAY,

518
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:15,155
"WHAT'S WRONG, MEGAN?"

519
00:14:15,155 --> 00:14:16,323
>> YEAH, AND THAT GETS ANNOYING.

520
00:14:16,323 --> 00:14:17,324
>> "NOTHING, MOM.

521
00:14:17,324 --> 00:14:18,325
NOTHING, MOM."

522
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:19,159
"WHAT'S WRONG, MEGAN?"

523
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:21,161
AND IT'S USUALLY SOMETHING.

524
00:14:21,161 --> 00:14:23,330
AND YOU SHOULD FEEL COMFORTABLE

525
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,098
TALKING TO ME ABOUT IT.

526
00:14:25,098 --> 00:14:26,599
DO YOU KNOW YOU CAN COME TO ME?

527
00:14:26,599 --> 00:14:27,767
>> I KNOW I CAN COME TO YOU,

528
00:14:27,767 --> 00:14:28,768
BUT I DON'T LIKE TALKING TO YOU

529
00:14:28,768 --> 00:14:29,937
ABOUT IT.

530
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:31,604
>> DO YOU THINK THAT HE'S GOT,

531
00:14:31,604 --> 00:14:36,109
LIKE, RESENTMENT, MAYBE, BECAUSE

532
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:37,610
HE'S NOT SINGLE AND FREE

533
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:38,778
ANYMORE?

534
00:14:38,778 --> 00:14:40,113
HE'S GOT RESPONSIBILITIES,

535
00:14:40,113 --> 00:14:42,950
AND HIS FRIENDS ARE MAYBE,

536
00:14:42,950 --> 00:14:44,584
"COME ON, NATE, WE NEED TO..."

537
00:14:44,584 --> 00:14:46,353
>> YEAH, HIS FRIENDS ARE--

538
00:14:46,353 --> 00:14:48,688
I KNOW, ARE A BIG PART OF IT.

539
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:50,523
THEY'VE TOLD HIM THAT THEY THINK

540
00:14:50,523 --> 00:14:52,359
HE NEEDS HIS SPACE.

541
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,860
>> WELL, YEAH, 'CAUSE HE'S

542
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,195
A GUY, AND HE'S A TEENAGER.

543
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:56,096
>> I THINK IT'S PROBABLY JUST

544
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:59,032
A STAGE THAT ALL BOYS GO

545
00:14:59,032 --> 00:15:00,000
THROUGH.

546
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,168
>> I KNOW, BUT I THINK YOU'VE

547
00:15:01,168 --> 00:15:02,502
MATURED A LOT FASTER THAN

548
00:15:02,502 --> 00:15:03,170
HE HAS.

549
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:04,204
>> THAT'S 'CAUSE I'VE GOT HIM

550
00:15:04,204 --> 00:15:05,905
IN MY BELLY.

551
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,340
>> A CONSTANT REMINDER.

552
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:09,276
>> YEAH.

553
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:12,612
IT'S THE MORNING OF MY BABY

554
00:15:12,612 --> 00:15:13,780
SHOWER, AND BECAUSE OF

555
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,515
EVERYTHING GOING ON WITH NATHAN,

556
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:17,184
I'M IN NO MOOD FOR A PARTY.

557
00:15:17,184 --> 00:15:17,917
[chime dings]

558
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:18,751
THE SHOWER IS AT NATHAN'S

559
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:19,919
PARENTS' HOUSE.

560
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:20,753
I'M GLAD THEY'RE BEING

561
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,921
SUPPORTIVE, BUT I DON'T KNOW

562
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,492
WHAT TO EXPECT FROM HIM.

563
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:28,161
>> HEY, MEG.

564
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:28,996
>> SO HOW ARE YOU FEELING

565
00:15:28,996 --> 00:15:30,163
ABOUT THE SHOWER?

566
00:15:30,163 --> 00:15:30,998
>> I DON'T WANT TO TALK

567
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:32,465
TO EVERYONE.

568
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:34,134
>> SHE'S JUST SO TIRED

569
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:35,002
AND STRESSED.

570
00:15:35,002 --> 00:15:35,835
>> ARE WE READY?

571
00:15:35,835 --> 00:15:37,070
>> YEAH.

572
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:40,073
I JUST GOT TO GET MY SHOES ON.

573
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:41,408
I'M GLAD THAT SO MANY OF MY

574
00:15:41,408 --> 00:15:42,409
FRIENDS ARE HERE, BECAUSE

575
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:43,743
I WORRY THAT EVERYONE HAS BEEN

576
00:15:43,743 --> 00:15:44,944
AVOIDING ME SINCE I GOT

577
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,113
PREGNANT.

578
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:47,580
DESPITE HIM NEEDING HIS SPACE,

579
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,781
NATHAN SHOWED UP.

580
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:49,449
>> WOW.

581
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,384
THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE HERE.

582
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,089
>> OH, I'M BOTH.

583
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:57,424
IT'S ALL A NEW EXPERIENCE FOR

584
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:58,425
ME, AND IT'S PRETTY

585
00:15:58,425 --> 00:16:00,127
OVERWHELMING.

586
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:01,461
>> ARE YOU GUYS READY?

587
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:03,796
MEGAN'S GONNA OPEN PRESENTS.

588
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:04,797
>> I WAS HOPING HE WOULD

589
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,466
OPEN PRESENTS WITH ME, BUT HE

590
00:16:06,466 --> 00:16:09,069
TOOK OFF WITH HIS FRIENDS.

591
00:16:14,741 --> 00:16:16,743
MY SISTER IS NOT HAPPY ABOUT

592
00:16:16,743 --> 00:16:18,578
THE WAY NATHAN'S TREATING ME,

593
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:21,581
SO SHE WANTS TO TALK TO HIM.

594
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:22,915
>> OBVIOUSLY, I LOVE MY SISTER

595
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:26,753
VERY MUCH, AND I DO HAVE A LOT

596
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:29,956
OF CONCERNS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT

597
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:32,292
YOU AND HER ARE GOING TO

598
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:33,393
ACTUALLY MAKE IT.

599
00:16:33,393 --> 00:16:34,227
YOU CAN STOP GLARING AT ME

600
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:35,695
AT ANY POINT IN TIME.

601
00:16:35,695 --> 00:16:37,030
>> I'M NOT GLARING.

602
00:16:37,030 --> 00:16:39,199
I'M JUST SITTING HERE.

603
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,301
>> AND MY CONCERNS AS FAR AS

604
00:16:41,301 --> 00:16:43,636
YOU GO IS, I'M PRETTY SURE THAT

605
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:45,305
ONCE THE BABY COMES AND YOU SEE

606
00:16:45,305 --> 00:16:46,806
HOW DIFFICULT IT'S GONNA BE,

607
00:16:46,806 --> 00:16:48,608
YOU'RE GONNA BE GONE.

608
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:49,609
>> OKAY, WELL, I GUESS I'M GONNA

609
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:51,611
PROVE YOU WRONG, 'CAUSE THERE'S

610
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,680
NO WAY I'M GONNA LEAVE.

611
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,014
>> RUMOR HAS IT YOU'VE ALREADY

612
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,185
TOLD MEGAN THAT IF THINGS DON'T

613
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:00,353
CHANGE, THAT YOU'RE LEAVING.

614
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:01,354
>> THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M GONNA

615
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,022
LEAVE MY BABY, THOUGH.

616
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,023
YEAH, IF ME AND MEGAN AREN'T

617
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:04,857
TOGETHER, IT DOESN'T MEAN

618
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,927
WE CAN'T RAISE HIM STILL.

619
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:08,761
>> I ALSO DON'T UNDERSTAND

620
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,663
HOW YOU INTEND ON TAKING CARE

621
00:17:10,663 --> 00:17:11,498
OF THIS BABY IF YOU DON'T

622
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:12,532
HAVE A JOB.

623
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:13,900
>> I'M LOOKING.

624
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,168
IT'S A LITTLE HARD RIGHT NOW.

625
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:16,336
>> YEAH, I GET THAT.

626
00:17:16,336 --> 00:17:18,505
THERE'S ALWAYS ANOTHER OPTION.

627
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:20,540
LIKE, THE ARMY IS STILL THERE.

628
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,309
>> I'M NOT GOING INTO THE ARMY.

629
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:23,976
>> [groans]

630
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:25,478
YOU'RE SO DEFINITIVE ABOUT THAT

631
00:17:25,478 --> 00:17:27,980
ANSWER, BUT THE FACT THAT YOU'RE

632
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,150
LIVING OFF OF MY DAD'S PAYCHECK

633
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:31,484
WHEN HE'S OVER IN AFGHANISTAN

634
00:17:31,484 --> 00:17:33,153
RIGHT NOW, DOESN'T REALLY

635
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,321
THRILL ME.

636
00:17:34,321 --> 00:17:36,489
EVEN IF YOU START CONSIDERING IT

637
00:17:36,489 --> 00:17:38,158
AND YOU TAKE THAT ONE LITTLE

638
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:40,660
STEP, YOU WILL HAVE A LITTLE BIT

639
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:43,430
MORE RESPECT FROM ME AND MY DAD.

640
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:46,666
WE HAVE SEVERE DOUBTS ABOUT YOU.

641
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,335
>> MY FAMILY DOUBTING NATHAN

642
00:17:48,335 --> 00:17:50,203
IS NOTHING NEW, BUT NOW I'M

643
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:52,572
STARTING TO DOUBT HIM TOO.

644
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:05,218
>> NATHAN SAYING HE MIGHT

645
00:18:05,218 --> 00:18:08,488
LEAVE ME REALLY HAS ME DOWN,

646
00:18:08,488 --> 00:18:10,022
SO I DECIDED TO HAVE SOME FUN

647
00:18:10,022 --> 00:18:11,658
TO TAKE MY MIND OFF THINGS.

648
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:13,393
[laughter]

649
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:16,496
>> WOW, THAT'S SHOCKING, HUH?

650
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:23,303
>> I REALLY MISS HAVING NATHAN

651
00:18:23,303 --> 00:18:25,037
AROUND, AND AFTER A FEW DAYS,

652
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:26,239
I GUESS HE STARTED TO MISS ME

653
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:28,541
TOO.

654
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,977
>> WE NEED TO TALK, BABE.

655
00:18:30,977 --> 00:18:34,314
I FEEL BAD FOR LEAVING

656
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:36,483
AND KIND OF HAVING YOU GUESS

657
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:38,251
ABOUT EVERYTHING,

658
00:18:38,251 --> 00:18:41,888
NOT KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

659
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:43,390
IT'S JUST--A LOT IS ON MY MIND

660
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,224
NOW.

661
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:45,725
YOU KNOW, ONE DAY I'M OUT,

662
00:18:45,725 --> 00:18:46,726
YOU KNOW, DOING WHATEVER I WANT

663
00:18:46,726 --> 00:18:48,728
TO DO, PARTYING AND JUST MESSING

664
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,830
AROUND, AND THE NEXT DAY,

665
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:53,500
I FIND OUT I'M HAVING A BABY,

666
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,335
AND THAT'S JUST A COMPLETE

667
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:58,338
CHANGE.

668
00:18:58,338 --> 00:18:59,239
I GUESS I'M STILL JUST TRYING

669
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,507
TO COPE AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

670
00:19:00,507 --> 00:19:02,175
WHAT'S GOING ON.

671
00:19:02,175 --> 00:19:03,343
>> IT KIND OF MADE ME THINK,

672
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:06,012
LIKE, HOW MANY TIMES ARE YOU

673
00:19:06,012 --> 00:19:07,680
GOING TO NEED TO GET AWAY,

674
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:09,516
AND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN, ONE OF

675
00:19:09,516 --> 00:19:11,017
THOSE TIMES, YOU JUST DECIDE

676
00:19:11,017 --> 00:19:12,885
TO NOT COME BACK?

677
00:19:12,885 --> 00:19:16,723
'CAUSE IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY

678
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:18,558
IF I HAVE TO RAISE THIS BABY

679
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:21,093
ON MY OWN.

680
00:19:21,093 --> 00:19:22,595
>> I WANT IT TO BE US

681
00:19:22,595 --> 00:19:24,931
AND NOT JUST YOU, YOU KNOW?

682
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:27,767
YOU AND THEN ME, SEPARATE.

683
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,536
I GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE

684
00:19:29,536 --> 00:19:31,538
COUNTING ON ME TO FAIL,

685
00:19:31,538 --> 00:19:32,539
AND I DON'T LIKE IT,

686
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,707
AND I NEED TO STEP UP,

687
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:37,143
AND I REALIZE THAT I WAS STUPID.

688
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:39,145
OKAY?

689
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:40,146
I'M SORRY.

690
00:19:40,146 --> 00:19:42,081
>> IT'S OKAY.

691
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:45,752
>> OKAY.

692
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:52,158
MY DUE DATE IS TWO WEEKS AWAY,

693
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:53,493
SO I'M GLAD NATHAN IS BACK

694
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:55,161
IN THE PICTURE, AND THIS TIME

695
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:56,329
IT'S NOT JUST TALK.

696
00:19:56,329 --> 00:19:57,664
HE'S ACTUALLY TAKING SOME

697
00:19:57,664 --> 00:19:58,498
ACTIONS.

698
00:19:58,498 --> 00:19:59,832
HE'S BEEN APPLYING FOR JOBS

699
00:19:59,832 --> 00:20:01,167
AND WENT ON AN INTERVIEW,

700
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:03,270
BUT IT HASN'T BEEN EASY.

701
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:04,271
HOW DO YOU THINK YOUR INTERVIEW

702
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:05,405
WENT?

703
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:06,273
>> IT WENT OKAY.

704
00:20:06,273 --> 00:20:07,274
I JUST THINK HE WAS LOOKING

705
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:09,576
FOR MORE OF--SOMEBODY OLDER.

706
00:20:09,576 --> 00:20:10,910
>> OH.

707
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:11,911
>> 'CAUSE I JUST CAME RIGHT OUT

708
00:20:11,911 --> 00:20:12,745
OF HIGH SCHOOL.

709
00:20:12,745 --> 00:20:14,080
IF I DON'T GET THIS JOB,

710
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,914
I THINK I SHOULD TRY TO FIND

711
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:16,015
A DIFFERENT ONE, EVEN IF IT'S

712
00:20:16,015 --> 00:20:17,917
SOMETHING SMALL.

713
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:18,751
>> IT WOULD BE NICE IF YOU GOT

714
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:19,752
A GOOD-PAYING JOB, 'CAUSE THEN

715
00:20:19,752 --> 00:20:20,753
MY MOM WOULDN'T HAVE TO BUY

716
00:20:20,753 --> 00:20:21,588
EVERYTHING.

717
00:20:21,588 --> 00:20:22,589
I ALWAYS FEEL BAD WHEN SHE PAYS

718
00:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,424
FOR STUFF.

719
00:20:24,424 --> 00:20:25,425
>> YEAH, I'VE BEEN TRYING,

720
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:27,294
BUT...

721
00:20:27,294 --> 00:20:28,928
IT'S, LIKE, ALL I DO.

722
00:20:28,928 --> 00:20:30,096
>> YEAH.

723
00:20:30,096 --> 00:20:32,599
>> WE'LL SEE.

724
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:36,603
[chime dings]

725
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:38,338
>> MY DUE DATE CAME AND WENT,

726
00:20:38,338 --> 00:20:39,906
SO TODAY WE'RE GOING TO THE

727
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,074
DOCTOR TO CHECK THINGS OUT.

728
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,410
>> I WANT TO CHECK YOUR CERVIX

729
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:44,911
AND SEE HOW IT GOES, AND THEN

730
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:45,912
IF WE'RE LUCKY, YOU'LL JUST

731
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:48,715
GO INTO LABOR THIS WEEKEND.

732
00:20:48,715 --> 00:20:51,284
SO YOU'RE, LIKE, STILL JUST 1.

733
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:53,252
BUT THINNED OUT, SO THAT'S GOOD.

734
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,521
THAT LAST MONTH OF PREGNANCY

735
00:20:54,521 --> 00:20:55,688
STARTS GETTING PRETTY OLD,

736
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:56,356
DOESN'T IT?

737
00:20:56,356 --> 00:20:57,023
>> YEAH.

738
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:58,257
>> YEAH, IT'S HARD.

739
00:20:58,257 --> 00:20:59,959
LET'S JUST CHECK THE BABY

740
00:20:59,959 --> 00:21:01,461
ON MONDAY TO MAKE SURE THAT

741
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:02,795
THE BABY'S DOING OKAY, AND THEN

742
00:21:02,795 --> 00:21:03,796
WE CAN KIND OF MAKE A PLAN FROM

743
00:21:03,796 --> 00:21:04,964
THERE IF WE NEED TO.

744
00:21:04,964 --> 00:21:07,233
>> OKAY.

745
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:11,504
>> WELL, IT'S STILL GONNA

746
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:12,271
BE SOON, THOUGH.

747
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:12,972
>> YEAH.

748
00:21:12,972 --> 00:21:13,873
>> NO MATTER WHAT, IT'S GONNA

749
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:16,809
BE HERE WITHIN THE WEEK.

750
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:17,977
>> NATHAN DOESN'T SEEM TO CARE

751
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:19,646
THAT I'M OVERDUE, BUT MY

752
00:21:19,646 --> 00:21:21,314
SISTER'S LEAVE IS UP, AND SHE

753
00:21:21,314 --> 00:21:22,315
HAS TO GO BACK TO HER BASE

754
00:21:22,315 --> 00:21:24,884
IN NORTH CAROLINA.

755
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:25,885
TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE,

756
00:21:25,885 --> 00:21:27,286
SHE MIGHT GET DEPLOYED OVERSEAS

757
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:29,589
BEFORE THE BABY ARRIVES.

758
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:31,424
>> SO YOUR SISTER JUST

759
00:21:31,424 --> 00:21:33,292
TEXTED ME.

760
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:35,094
BECAUSE OF THE EARTHQUAKE IN

761
00:21:35,094 --> 00:21:38,765
HAITI, THE 82ND'S BEING

762
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:42,435
DEPLOYED, SO SHE WON'T BE HERE

763
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,937
TO SEE BLAKE LIKE SHE PLANNED.

764
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:46,773
I THINK SHE'S LEAVING TOMORROW.

765
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:48,441
SHE ONLY GETS, LIKE, ONE MORE

766
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:49,442
PHONE CALL, I THINK,

767
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:50,410
BEFORE SHE LEAVES.

768
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,345
SO SHE'S GONNA TRY AND CALL YOU.

769
00:21:55,047 --> 00:21:56,549
[cell phone ringing]

770
00:21:56,549 --> 00:21:57,384
IT'S YOUR SISTER CALLING

771
00:21:57,384 --> 00:22:01,253
RIGHT NOW.

772
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:02,389
>> HELLO?

773
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:03,890

774
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:05,392
I'M GOING TO HAITI.

775
00:22:05,392 --> 00:22:07,059
>> YEAH.

776
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:07,894
>> WE CAN LEAVE AS EARLY AS

777
00:22:07,894 --> 00:22:11,398
TOMORROW NIGHT, SO...

778
00:22:11,398 --> 00:22:13,065
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG

779
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:14,401
I'M GONNA BE OVER THERE.

780
00:22:14,401 --> 00:22:16,068
BUT WHEN WE COME BACK, WE'RE

781
00:22:16,068 --> 00:22:17,069
PROBABLY GONNA TURN AROUND

782
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:19,739
AND GO RIGHT TO AFGHANISTAN,

783
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:24,276
SO IT MIGHT BE...[laughs]

784
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:25,277
MORE THAN A YEAR BEFORE

785
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:26,913
I COME HOME AND SEE YOU.

786
00:22:26,913 --> 00:22:28,080
>> OH, WOW.

787
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:29,582
I'LL SEND YOU PICTURES

788
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:30,583
AND STUFF.

789
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:32,419
>> WELL, I KNOW YOU'RE TIRED,

790
00:22:32,419 --> 00:22:33,753
SO I'LL LET YOU GO.

791
00:22:33,753 --> 00:22:35,588
>> OKAY.

792
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:36,923
>> I LOVE YOU. GOOD LUCK.

793
00:22:36,923 --> 00:22:37,590
>> I LOVE YOU TOO.

794
00:22:37,590 --> 00:22:38,591
THANKS.

795
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:42,595
>> BYE.

796
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:43,463
>> I'VE ALWAYS LOOKED TO MY

797
00:22:43,463 --> 00:22:44,431
SISTER TO HELP ME GET THROUGH

798

ANYTHING SCARY IN LIFE,

799
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,266
AND I'M ABOUT TO FACE MY

SCARIEST EXPERIENCE YET,

801
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:51,604
BUT THE ONE PERSON WHO I'VE

802
00:22:51,604 --> 00:22:53,272
ALWAYS COUNTED ON WILL BE

803
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:55,875
HALFWAY ACROSS THE WORLD.

804
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,717
>> ANOTHER WEEK HAS PASSED,

805
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,719
AND I STILL DON'T HAVE MY BABY.

806
00:23:06,719 --> 00:23:08,220
I'M BUMMED THAT MY SISTER IS

807
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,222
GONE, BUT MY DAD WAS ABLE TO GET

808
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,724
SOME TIME OFF TO COME HOME

809
00:23:11,724 --> 00:23:12,559
FOR THE BIRTH.

810
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:13,225
>> HI, BABY.

811
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:14,193
>> HI.

812
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:15,562
>> I MISSED YOU.

813
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:17,163
>> MISSED YOU TOO.

SO F--BIG.

816
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,167
>> YOU ALMOST SAID FAT.

00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:22,168
[laughs]

818
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:23,670

>> [laughs]

820
00:23:25,572 --> 00:23:27,406
>> SO WHERE'S THE BABY?

821
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:28,074
>> RIGHT THERE.

822
00:23:28,074 --> 00:23:28,875
>> HOW COME YOU DIDN'T

823
00:23:28,875 --> 00:23:29,408
HAVE IT YET?

824
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,409
>> IT'S NOT UP TO ME.

825
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:31,243
HE DECIDED HE DIDN'T WANT

826
00:23:31,243 --> 00:23:33,580
TO COME YET.

827
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,181
I'M GLAD YOU'RE HOME.

828
00:23:35,181 --> 00:23:36,583
>> WELL, I'M GLAD I'M HOME TOO.

829
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:37,349
I HOPE YOU HAVE THIS THING

830
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:38,851
BEFORE I HAVE TO GO BACK.

831
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:39,852

832
00:23:39,852 --> 00:23:40,587
DON'T WORRY.

833
00:23:40,587 --> 00:23:41,688
>> THE CLOCK IS TICKING.

834
00:23:41,688 --> 00:23:42,855
>> MY DAD COULD GET CALLED BACK

835
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:45,191
TO DUTY AT ANY TIME, SO I REALLY

836
00:23:45,191 --> 00:23:46,593
WANT TO GET THIS BABY OUT WHILE

837
00:23:46,593 --> 00:23:48,595
HE'S HERE, AND AS OF TODAY,

838
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:49,862
I'M OUT OF SCHOOL UNTIL AFTER

839
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:51,197

>> GOOGLING HOW TO INDUCE LABOR.

00:23:55,468 --> 00:23:56,969
ON HOW TO GET THIS BABY OUT

844
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:58,037

WHAT ONE SHOULD I DO, HONEY?

848
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:03,976
>> DO THE SKI ONE.

849
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:07,046

I CAN'T DO IT.

>> JUST DRINK IT STRAIGHT.

857
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:18,558
I DON'T THINK IT WOULD BE

858
00:24:18,558 --> 00:24:19,225
THAT BAD.

AND THE PAIN WAS SO BAD.

871
00:24:45,585 --> 00:24:46,853
I COULD BARELY WALK INTO

>> YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHY?

1034
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:02,268
SHE'S PROBABLY JUST NOT SURE

HOW TO HANDLE HER FRIEND

1036
00:30:03,936 --> 00:30:05,604

TO SCHOOL, AND EVERYBODY ELSE

1039
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:11,377
IS AT SCHOOL, SO DO YOU THINK

1040
00:30:11,377 --> 00:30:13,212
THAT'S PART OF IT?

1041
00:30:13,212 --> 00:30:14,680
>> COULD BE.

1042
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:16,949
KIND OF SUCKS.

1043
00:30:16,949 --> 00:30:17,950

1045
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:21,620
WATCH THE BABY SO NATHAN AND I

1046
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,788

>> NO.

AFTER ALL OF THIS.

1060
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:46,045
BUT I JUST--I DIDN'T WANT IT

1061
00:30:46,045 --> 00:30:48,214
TO HAPPEN, BUT...

>> A TRUE FRIEND WILL MAKE

1063
00:30:49,048 --> 00:30:50,382
THE EFFORT.

1064
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:52,584
YOU DEFINE YOUR FRIENDS BY

1065
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:53,920
IF THEY'RE THERE FOR YOU.

1066
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:54,753
IF THEY'RE NOT GONNA MAKE

1067
00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:56,088
THE EFFORT, IT'S NOT WORTH IT

1068
00:30:56,088 --> 00:30:57,689
AT ALL.

1069
00:30:57,689 --> 00:30:58,524
I THINK HARD TIMES DEFINES

1070
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:00,359
WHO SOMEBODY REALLY IS.

1071
00:31:00,359 --> 00:31:01,660

1072

1073
00:31:03,662 --> 00:31:04,463
I JUST WISH HE WOULD LISTEN

1074
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:06,332
TO HIS OWN WORDS.

1075
00:31:08,134 --> 00:31:09,401
TOMORROW IS MY FIRST DAY

I'M READY FOR IT.

1082
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,913

AWKWARD.

1120
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:19,338
BUT I'VE GOT MORE IMPORTANT

1121
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:22,908
STUFF RIGHT NOW TO THINK ABOUT.

1122
00:32:22,908 --> 00:32:27,513
HUH, BABY?

1123
00:32:27,513 --> 00:32:28,514
WE'RE SLEEPING IN THE LIVING

1124
00:32:28,514 --> 00:32:29,915
ROOM SO WE CAN BE CLOSER

1125
00:32:29,915 --> 00:32:31,017
TO THE KITCHEN TO HEAT UP

1126
00:32:31,017 --> 00:32:32,618
BOTTLES.

1127
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:34,353
>> YOU CAN SIT NEXT TO ME, OKAY?

1128
00:32:34,353 --> 00:32:35,054
OKAY, NOW WE CAN PLAY.

1129
00:32:35,054 --> 00:32:37,223
NOW IT'S THE RIGHT COLORS, OKAY?

1130
00:32:37,223 --> 00:32:39,391
>> HONEY, I'M GONNA GO TO SLEEP.

1131
00:32:39,391 --> 00:32:40,559
>> OKAY.

1132
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:41,560
>> I LOVE YOU.

1133
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,662
>> I LOVE YOU TOO.

1134
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:45,597
>> MWAH.

1135
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:01,347
[baby crying]

1136
00:33:06,218 --> 00:33:07,719
EVEN THOUGH I'M THE ONE WHO HAS

1137
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:08,887
TO BE UP IN THE MORNING FOR

1138
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:11,423
SCHOOL, NATHAN IS NOT MOVING.

1139
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,596
[baby crying]

1140
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,140
>> OH, YOU'RE UP.

1141
00:33:28,140 --> 00:33:29,308
CAN I HOLD YOU WHILE MAMA

1142
00:33:29,308 --> 00:33:31,110
GETS READY FOR SCHOOL?

1143
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,611
>> [yawning] HE IS OUT.

1144
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:34,146
>> OKAY.

1145
00:33:34,146 --> 00:33:35,314
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING

1146
00:33:35,314 --> 00:33:36,815
TO STAY AWAKE IN CLASS WITH

1147
00:33:36,815 --> 00:33:39,085
HARDLY ANY SLEEP.

1148
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:49,761
I'M TOTALLY DREADING SCHOOL,

1149
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,097
AND WHEN I GOT THERE,

1150
00:33:51,097 --> 00:33:53,099
EVERYONE WAS STARING AT ME.

1151
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:54,933
SEEING MY FRIENDS ONLY CONFIRMED

1152
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:56,102
THAT I HAVE NOTHING IN COMMON

1153
00:33:56,102 --> 00:33:58,437
WITH THEM ANYMORE.

1154
00:33:58,437 --> 00:33:59,638
WHILE I'M TRYING TO BE A MOM

1155
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:01,507
AND A STUDENT, NATHAN REFUSES TO

1156
00:34:01,507 --> 00:34:03,509
GET OFF THE COUCH AND PITCH IN.

1157
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:05,010
SO MY MOM HAS NO CHOICE

1158
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:06,345
BUT TO TAKE CARE OF BLAKE

1159
00:34:06,345 --> 00:34:07,679
WHEN I'M AT SCHOOL.

1160
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,015
>> HE LIKES THAT HE'S BEEN

1161
00:34:10,015 --> 00:34:11,350
AROUND AND HASN'T HAD TO DO

1162
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:12,618
ANYTHING.

1163
00:34:12,618 --> 00:34:15,954
YOU GUYS DON'T...[scoffs]

1164
00:34:15,954 --> 00:34:17,789
YOU WANT TO MOVE OUT AND HAVE

1165
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:19,291
HIM HAVE A GOOD JOB AND ALL THIS

1166
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:21,293
STUFF, BUT YOU STILL DON'T KNOW

1167
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:23,129
ALL THE STUFF YOU HAVE TO DO

1168
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:26,465
TO HAVE A HOUSE AND A BABY

1169
00:34:26,465 --> 00:34:28,300
AND GO TO SCHOOL AND WORK,

1170
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:30,769
ALL THAT STUFF.

1171
00:34:30,769 --> 00:34:32,104
>> BECAUSE WE'RE COMPLETELY

1172
00:34:32,104 --> 00:34:33,572
IGNORANT.

1173
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:35,907
>> NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

1174
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,243
BUT WHO WASHES THE BOTTLES,

1175
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:39,411
AND WHO WASHES THE CLOTHES?

1176
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:40,412
>> I CAN DO THAT.

1177
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:41,413
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO IT,

1178
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:42,248
THEN TELL ME.

1179
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:43,315
I'LL DO IT.

1180
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:44,150
THE ONLY REASON I DON'T

1181
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,984
IS BECAUSE YOU OFFERED TO.

1182
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:46,852
AND, YOU KNOW, IF SOMEONE'S

1183
00:34:46,852 --> 00:34:48,154
GONNA OFFER TO DO THAT STUFF,

1184
00:34:48,154 --> 00:34:49,155
THEN WHY NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE

1185
00:34:49,155 --> 00:34:51,657
OF IT?

1186
00:34:51,657 --> 00:34:53,159
I'M GETTING ANNOYED WITH MY MOM

1187
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,860
BECAUSE I KNOW SHE HAS A POINT.

1188
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:56,128
NATHAN SAID HE WOULD GET A JOB

1189
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,863
AFTER THE BABY CAME, BUT SO FAR,

1190
00:34:57,863 --> 00:34:59,798
HE HASN'T FOLLOWED THROUGH.

1191
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:03,068
EVERY DAY I COME HOME TO

1192
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:04,903
THE SAME THING: MY MOM WATCHING

1193
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:06,405
THE BABY AND NATHAN PLAYING

1194
00:35:06,405 --> 00:35:08,240
VIDEO GAMES INSTEAD OF LOOKING

1195
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,908
FOR A JOB.

1196
00:35:09,908 --> 00:35:11,577
>> HOW WAS SCHOOL?

1197
00:35:11,577 --> 00:35:13,011
>> BORING.

1198
00:35:13,011 --> 00:35:15,347
YOU AND YOUR VIDEO GAMES.

1199
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:16,182
>> THERE'S NOTHING WRONG

1200
00:35:16,182 --> 00:35:17,883
WITH VIDEO GAMES.

1201
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:18,984
>> UNLESS YOU'RE GETTING PAID

1202
00:35:18,984 --> 00:35:20,152
FOR VIDEO GAMES, THEN THERE'S

1203
00:35:20,152 --> 00:35:21,353
SOMETHING WRONG WITH VIDEO

1204
00:35:21,353 --> 00:35:22,020
GAMES.

1205
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:22,854
>> WELL, LET'S FIND A WAY

1206
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:24,556
TO GET ME PAID, THEN.

1207
00:35:24,556 --> 00:35:26,057
>> CAN YOU PAUSE THAT OR

1208
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:28,727
SOMETHING FOR A LITTLE BIT?

1209
00:35:28,727 --> 00:35:30,229
>> NO.

1210
00:35:30,229 --> 00:35:32,398
>> PLEASE?

1211
00:35:32,398 --> 00:35:33,899
>> YEAH.

1212
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:35,000
>> I'M PRETTY TIRED OF LIVING

1213
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,669
UNDER MY MOM'S ROOF.

1214
00:35:37,669 --> 00:35:38,670
>> YEAH.

1215
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,340
>> AND I KNOW YOU'VE APPLIED

1216
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:43,675
FOR WORK AT A LOT OF PLACES, BUT

1217
00:35:43,675 --> 00:35:45,344
THERE'S ALSO A LOT MORE PLACES

1218
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:47,313
THAT YOU HAVEN'T APPLIED TO.

1219
00:35:47,313 --> 00:35:48,314
NOW THAT WE'RE PARENTS,

1220
00:35:48,314 --> 00:35:50,316
WE KIND OF NEED TO LAY OFF

1221
00:35:50,316 --> 00:35:53,151
THE VIDEO GAMES AND HELP CHANGE

1222
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,320
MORE DIAPERS AND EVERYTHING

1223
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,722
AND GET A JOB.

1224
00:35:56,722 --> 00:35:57,589
>> WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT ME

1225
00:35:57,589 --> 00:35:59,658
TO DO?

1226
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:00,659
DO YOU WANT ME TO FIND A JOB?

1227
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:01,493
DO YOU WANT ME TO STAY HOME

1228
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:02,861
AND TAKE CARE OF THE BABY?

1229
00:36:02,861 --> 00:36:04,596
WHICH ONE IS IT?

1230
00:36:04,596 --> 00:36:07,065
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

1231
00:36:07,065 --> 00:36:08,066
>> I WOULD LIKE IF

1232
00:36:08,066 --> 00:36:09,000
YOU GOT A JOB.

1233
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,669
MAYBE IF YOU TALKED TO SOME

1234
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:12,003
OF YOUR FRIENDS WHO HAVE JOBS

1235
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,171
AND ASK IF THEY COULD HELP YOU

1236
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,873
GET A JOB OR SOMETHING,

1237
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:17,276
THAT WOULD HELP A LOT.

1238
00:36:17,276 --> 00:36:18,777
LIKE, I DON'T WANT IT TO JUST

1239
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:20,279
KEEP ON GOING, LIKE, EVERY DAY

1240
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:26,117
WAITING FOR SOMETHING TO HAPPEN.

1241
00:36:26,117 --> 00:36:28,454
I HOPE HE TAKES THIS SERIOUSLY,

1242
00:36:28,454 --> 00:36:29,688
BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE HOW MUCH

1243
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,623
LONGER I'M WILLING TO WAIT.

1244
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,371
>> THE PRESSURE IS BUILDING

1245
00:36:45,371 --> 00:36:46,705
FOR NATHAN TO GET A JOB,

1246
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:48,173
SO HE INVITED HIS FRIENDS OVER,

1247
00:36:48,173 --> 00:36:49,675
WHO JUST GOT JOBS LAYING FLOORS

1248
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:51,176
IN TEXAS, TO FIND OUT

1249
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:52,010
ABOUT WORK.

1250
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,345
>> OH.

1251
00:36:53,345 --> 00:36:54,680
>> GONNA DO SOME HOOKAH?

1252
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,348
>> YEAH, MIGHT AS WELL, RIGHT?

1253
00:36:56,348 --> 00:36:56,948
>> YUMMY.

1254
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:57,616
>> ALL RIGHT.

1255
00:36:57,616 --> 00:36:59,084
>> WHAT YOU GONNA PUT IN THERE?

1256
00:36:59,084 --> 00:37:01,420
>> WE GOT APRICOT, GRAPE,

1257
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:02,754
AND CANTALOUPE.

1258
00:37:02,754 --> 00:37:05,357
>> SO HOW'S THE BABY GOING?

1259
00:37:05,357 --> 00:37:06,358
>> GOING GOOD.

1260
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:07,626
A LITTLE TIRING.

1261
00:37:07,626 --> 00:37:08,460
SO WHAT'S GOING ON WITH

1262
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,695
THE TEXAS?

1263
00:37:09,695 --> 00:37:10,696

THIS MORNING.

1265
00:37:11,997 --> 00:37:12,998
>> YEAH, WHEN DO YOU LEAVE?

1266
00:37:12,998 --> 00:37:13,999
>> I ACTUALLY LEAVE THIS

1267
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:15,166
SATURDAY, YOU KNOW?

1268
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,502
[hookah bubbling]

1269

IF STUFF DOESN'T START PICKING

00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:20,339
UP HERE, WE COULD EASILY HAVE

00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:21,673
YOU OUT THERE WORKING,

IF YOU WANTED.

1273
00:37:22,841 --> 00:37:24,142
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

1274
00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:25,143
>> WELL, I DO.

1275
00:37:25,143 --> 00:37:27,145
I JUST--I DON'T KNOW.

1276
00:37:27,145 --> 00:37:28,947
IT DEPENDS.

1277
00:37:28,947 --> 00:37:29,948
>> THEY WANTED ME TO INVITE SOME

1278
00:37:29,948 --> 00:37:31,116
PEOPLE OUT LAST TIME I WAS OUT

1279
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:33,952
THERE, 'CAUSE THERE'S JUST

1280
00:37:33,952 --> 00:37:34,953
SO MUCH WORK.

1281
00:37:34,953 --> 00:37:36,021
>> RIGHT.

1282
00:37:36,021 --> 00:37:37,188
>> YOU COULD ALWAYS RELY

00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,024
ON THERE BEING SOME MONEY.

>> WE NEED MONEY.

00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:40,526
WE NEED TO--

1286
00:37:40,526 --> 00:37:41,360
YOU KNOW, WE NEED TO START

1287
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,295
DOING SOMETHING.

1288

>> WHEN I CAME HOME FROM SCHOOL,

1289
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:50,769
NATHAN TOLD ME THAT THERE IS

1290
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,671
A JOB OPPORTUNITY, BUT IT'S

1291
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:54,172
ALL THE WAY IN TEXAS.

>> I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG

1293
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:55,841
I WOULD BE THERE.

1294

I DON'T KNOW.

1295
00:37:57,175 --> 00:37:59,845
I KNOW IT'S DOING TILE,

1296
00:37:59,845 --> 00:38:01,580
DOING FLOORS.

1297
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,581
I MEAN, IF TYLER CAN DO IT,

1298
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:03,749
I CAN DO IT.

1299
00:38:03,749 --> 00:38:05,417

WHEN HE WAS THERE, HE ALSO

1301
00:38:06,585 --> 00:38:08,487
PARTIED A LOT.

1302
00:38:08,487 --> 00:38:09,488
>> WHO SAID--WHO SAID I WAS

1303
00:38:09,488 --> 00:38:11,156
GONNA GO PARTY?

1304
00:38:11,156 --> 00:38:12,524
>> WELL, YOU'D GO WITH HIM,

1305
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:13,392
'CAUSE YOU'D BE STAYING

1306
00:38:13,392 --> 00:38:14,460
WITH HIM.

1307
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,361
>> IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE WORRIED

1308
00:38:15,361 --> 00:38:16,362
ABOUT?

1309
00:38:16,362 --> 00:38:17,496
>> NO, I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE

1310
00:38:17,496 --> 00:38:18,997
GONE EITHER, 'CAUSE IT WOULD BE

1311
00:38:18,997 --> 00:38:20,666
HARD TAKING CARE OF HIM WITHOUT

1312
00:38:20,666 --> 00:38:21,667
YOU HERE.

1313
00:38:21,667 --> 00:38:22,868
>> I KNOW.

1314
00:38:22,868 --> 00:38:25,537
BUT IT'S KIND OF HARD TO BEGIN

1315
00:38:25,537 --> 00:38:26,872
OUR LIFE WITHOUT ANY MONEY,

1316
00:38:26,872 --> 00:38:29,408
WITHOUT A JOB, TRUE?

1317
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,044
THIS IS, LIKE, ONE OF THE ONLY

1318
00:38:33,044 --> 00:38:33,912
OPTIONS.

1319
00:38:33,912 --> 00:38:35,080
WHAT ELSE DO I HAVE?

1320
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,081
I CAN GO TO SCHOOL, BUT THAT'S

1321
00:38:36,081 --> 00:38:37,649
NOT GONNA HELP US ANY.

1322
00:38:37,649 --> 00:38:38,817
REALLY, THE ONLY OTHER OPTION

1323
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:41,920
IS SOME TYPE OF MILITARY.

1324
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:42,754
AND WITH THAT, I'M GONNA

1325
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:44,189
BE GONE TOO.

1326
00:38:44,189 --> 00:38:45,056
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT ME TO

1327
00:38:45,056 --> 00:38:47,693
LEAVE, BUT LIKE YOUR DAD SAID,

1328
00:38:47,693 --> 00:38:48,860
IF I DON'T...

1329
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,028
YOU KNOW, IF I'M NOT SACRIFICING

1330
00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:51,029
NOW, I'M GONNA HAVE TO SACRIFICE

1331
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:54,733
IN A LITTLE BIT.

1332
00:38:54,733 --> 00:38:56,067
>> I JUST DON'T WANT YOU TO GO

1333
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:58,770
ANYWHERE.

1334
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:04,275
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

1335
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:07,613
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1336
00:39:07,613 --> 00:39:10,449
>> * THINK I'M SLIPPING UNDER *

1337
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:12,283
* YES, I'M DROWNING *

1338
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:13,619
* IN MY THOUGHTS *

1339
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:15,020
>> I KNOW WE NEED TO SUPPORT

1340
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,187
OUR BABY, AND I WANT NATHAN

1341
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,355
TO GET A JOB.

1342
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,524
I JUST DIDN'T MEAN HALFWAY

1343
00:39:18,524 --> 00:39:21,359
ACROSS THE COUNTRY.

1344
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,361
BEING A TEEN MOM, I HAVE HAD

1345
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:27,533
TO MAKE A LOT OF SACRIFICES.

1346
00:39:27,533 --> 00:39:29,535
I THINK HAVING A BABY HAS PUT

1347
00:39:29,535 --> 00:39:31,369
A LOT OF PRESSURE ON MINE

1348
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,371
AND NATHAN'S RELATIONSHIP.

1349
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,206
>> I KNOW MEGAN'S GOT A PROBLEM

1350
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:38,710
WITH YOU GOING TO TEXAS, BUT,

1351
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,378
BABY, A GUY'S GOT TO TAKE CARE

1352
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:41,379
OF HIS FAMILY, YOU KNOW?

1353
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,548
AND I'M SORRY IF THAT

1354
00:39:42,548 --> 00:39:43,915
SOUNDS SEXIST.

1355
00:39:43,915 --> 00:39:45,917
MEGAN'S MY DAUGHTER, AND FOR

1356
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:47,753
BETTER OR WORSE, I'M GONNA

1357
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:49,555
EXPECT YOU TO TAKE CARE OF HER.

1358
00:39:49,555 --> 00:39:52,157
>> OUR WHOLE FUTURE IS DEPENDING

1359
00:39:52,157 --> 00:39:54,893
ON IF WE GET JOBS OR NOT.

1360
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,562
NATHAN NEEDS TO FOCUS MORE ON

1361
00:39:56,562 --> 00:39:58,730
HIS FAMILY AND LOOK FOR A JOB,

1362
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,231
SO WE CAN GET OUR LIFE MOVING.

1363
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,833
>> LOOK AT THAT!

1364
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:02,834
>> JUST HAVE OUR OWN PLACE

1365
00:40:02,834 --> 00:40:05,437
AND BE OUR OWN LITTLE FAMILY.

1366
00:40:05,437 --> 00:40:07,105
>> YOU'RE BETTER THAN DADDY.

1367
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:08,707
>> BEFORE I GOT PREGNANT,

1368
00:40:08,707 --> 00:40:10,408
ALL I CARED ABOUT WAS JUST

1369
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:11,409
HAVING FUN.

1370
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,711
NOW ALL I CARE ABOUT

1371
00:40:12,711 --> 00:40:15,380
IS FINISHING SCHOOL AND TRYING

1372
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,215
TO FIND A JOB, AND I WORRY ABOUT

1373
00:40:17,215 --> 00:40:18,383
MONEY AND ALL THE IMPORTANT

1374
00:40:18,383 --> 00:40:19,885
STUFF.

1375
00:40:19,885 --> 00:40:21,953
AS MUCH AS I LOVE BLAKE,

1376
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:24,456
I DON'T LOVE THE FACT THAT

1377
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:26,625
IT'S PUSHED AWAY MY FRIENDS,

1378
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:30,361
BECAUSE YOU NEED FRIENDS

1379
00:40:30,361 --> 00:40:33,465
ALL THE TIME.

1380
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:35,133
IT'S HARD NOT HAVING PEOPLE

1381
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:39,638
TO TALK TO.

1382
00:40:39,638 --> 00:40:41,139
I DO WISH I WOULD HAVE BEEN

1383
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:42,741
OLDER BY THE TIME I HAD

1384
00:40:42,741 --> 00:40:44,976
MY FIRST KID.

1385
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:46,645
I LOVE HIM, BUT IT'S JUST

1386
00:40:46,645 --> 00:40:49,414
REALLY HARD AT THIS AGE.

00:41:05,363 --> 00:41:06,732
>> BOTH MY MOM AND I,

1390
00:41:06,732 --> 00:41:08,366
WE CONSIDERED EVERY OPTION.

1391
00:41:08,366 --> 00:41:09,400
>> YOUR AUNT LISA CALLED.

1392
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,002
LISA AND KENNY CALLED,

1393
00:41:11,002 --> 00:41:12,170
AND THEY WANTED ME TO ASK YOU

1394
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:13,705
IF IT WAS OKAY IF THEY COULD

1395
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:15,340
ADOPT YOUR BABY.

1396
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:16,174
>> WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

1397
00:41:16,174 --> 00:41:17,709
YOU REALIZE, THERE'S REALLY NO

1398
00:41:17,709 --> 00:41:19,010
GOING BACK ON IT.

1399
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,011
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE GONNA

1400
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:22,581
GO THROUGH WITH THIS.

1401
00:41:22,581 --> 00:41:23,248
>> [sniffles]

1402
00:41:23,248 --> 00:41:24,249
>> DO YOU HONESTLY THINK YOU

1403
00:41:24,249 --> 00:41:25,250
MADE THE WRONG CHOICE?

1404
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:25,984
YOU DON'T--

1405
00:41:25,984 --> 00:41:27,919
>> YES.
