AND EVEN THOUGH I'M TOTALLY

7
00:00:12,246 --> 00:00:13,781
FOCUSED ON SCHOOL, I LOVE

8
00:00:13,781 --> 00:00:14,782
HANGING OUT WITH MY FRIENDS

9
00:00:14,782 --> 00:00:16,450
AND HAVING FUN.

11
00:00:17,751 --> 00:00:19,087
I LIVE WITH MY MOM AND DON'T

MY FAVORITE SPORT IS FOOTBALL,

00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,001
TWO MONTHS AGO, I STARTED DATING

23
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,572
HE'S AN AWESOME FOOTBALL PLAYER.

41
00:00:58,659 --> 00:01:00,161
AND HE JOKES AROUND A LITTLE

42
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:01,662
TOO MUCH AT TIMES.

43
00:01:01,662 --> 00:01:02,663

44
00:01:02,663 --> 00:01:04,165

IT'S A MONTH BEFORE SCHOOL

48

49
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:16,844
FOOTBALL GAME OF THE YEAR.

50

53
00:01:20,514 --> 00:01:22,350
IT'S THE DIXIE BELLES.

>> I CARE.

THINGS ARE DEFINITELY DIFFERENT

57
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,388
NOW THAT I'M PREGNANT.

58
00:01:27,388 --> 00:01:28,889

OH, MY GOD.

00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:36,130
IT'S GONNA MAKE ME CRY,

ON HER OWN.

121
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,585

00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:03,904
IT'S A BABY, AND EVERYTHING

191
00:05:03,904 --> 00:05:05,205
IS GONNA BE OKAY."

192
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:06,039
BUT IT'S NOT.

193
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:06,907
WE'RE BOTH GONNA HAVE

194
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:07,608
TO GET JOBS.

195
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:08,509
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO STAY

196
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:09,477
IN SCHOOL, BECAUSE THE BABY

197
00:05:09,477 --> 00:05:10,344
IS GONNA NEED BETTER.

198
00:05:10,344 --> 00:05:11,445
I DON'T WANT HIM GROWING UP

199
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:12,680
WITH NOTHING.

200
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,383
>> YEAH.

201
00:05:15,383 --> 00:05:17,117
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

202
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:19,620
THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT,

203
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,954
THERE ARE A LOT OF REASONS

204
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:21,955
WHY ADOPTION COULD BE

205
00:05:21,955 --> 00:05:24,625
THE RIGHT CHOICE.

206
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:25,859
IT'S GONNA BE HARD TO TALK TO

207
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,361
ZAK, BECAUSE HE'S SO EXCITED

208
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:28,862
ABOUT THE BABY.

209
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:29,863
>> WHAT'S UP? WHAT'S UP?

210
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:30,864
>> HEY.

211
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:31,965
>> YOU WANNA TALK?

212
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:33,534
>> YEAH.

213
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:35,035
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT

214
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,604
DOING ADOPTION.

215
00:05:36,604 --> 00:05:37,938
>> FOR REAL?

216
00:05:37,938 --> 00:05:39,006
>> YEAH.

217
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:39,940
>> YOU AIN'T SAID NOTHING

218
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,841
ABOUT THAT.

219
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,009
>> WELL, I THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

220
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,010
>> WELL, WHY DO YOU WANT TO DO

221
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:44,177
ADOPTION?

222
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,013
>> I FEEL LIKE ADOPTION WILL

223
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,180
GIVE HIM A BETTER LIFE

224
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,682
AS WELL AS US.

225
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:49,850
WE COULD CONTINUE TO GO

226
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,851
TO SCHOOL.

227
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,352
WE CAN GET THE EDUCATION

228
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:53,587
THAT WE NEED.

229
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:54,422
>> HE'S NOT GONNA--

230
00:05:54,422 --> 00:05:55,322
>> GO TO COLLEGE AND GET

231
00:05:55,322 --> 00:05:56,089
A GOOD JOB.

232
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,024
>> WHY YOU THINK HE GONNA

233
00:05:57,024 --> 00:05:57,758
STOP THAT?

234
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:58,926
>> BECAUSE WE'RE STRUGGLING.

235
00:05:58,926 --> 00:05:59,827
AND IF WE'RE STRUGGLING,

236
00:05:59,827 --> 00:06:01,094
HE'S GONNA STRUGGLE.

237
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:01,895
HE'S GONNA GROW UP

238
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:02,630
WITH NO MONEY.

239
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,964
HE'S GONNA GROW UP NOT HAVING

240
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:04,698
WHAT HE NEEDS.

241
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,299
>> NOT NECESSARILY.

242
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:07,468
I GREW UP JUST FINE.

243
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:08,636
MY MAMA RAISED THREE KIDS

244
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:10,804
BY HERSELF, WORKING TWO JOBS,

245
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:11,472
ONE JOB.

246
00:06:11,472 --> 00:06:12,339
SHE DID IT BY HERSELF.

247
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:13,541
>> OKAY, SHE'S WORKING.

248
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:17,244
WE'RE NOT WORKING.

249
00:06:17,244 --> 00:06:18,579
>> I THINK THE MAIN REASON THAT

250
00:06:18,579 --> 00:06:20,247
I WANT HIM IS BECAUSE MY DAD

251
00:06:20,247 --> 00:06:21,582
NEVER WAS AROUND.

252
00:06:21,582 --> 00:06:23,316
>> I'M JUST SAYING,

253
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:24,818
THERE'S A LOT TO THINK ABOUT.

254
00:06:24,818 --> 00:06:25,953
>> OH, YEAH.

255
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:28,021
A LOT FOR YOU TO THINK ABOUT?

256
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:29,022
>> NO, THERE'S A LOT FOR

257
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:31,492
BOTH OF US TO THINK ABOUT.

258
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,937
>> I'M BUMMED THAT ZAK IS SO

259
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:46,273
AGAINST THE IDEA OF ADOPTION.

260
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:47,941
I KNOW HE HAS HIS REASONS,

261
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,342
BUT I DON'T THINK HE REALIZES

262
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,411
HOW HARD PARENTING IS.

263
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,580
ZAK DOESN'T WANT TO DO ADOPTION,

264
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,347
LIKE, POINT-BLANK, PERIOD.

265
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:56,016
HIS DAD WASN'T THERE FOR HIM,

266
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,184
SO HE'S LIKE, "I DON'T WANT

267
00:06:57,184 --> 00:06:58,852
MY KID TO BE RAISED WITHOUT

268
00:06:58,852 --> 00:07:00,020
A FATHER, BECAUSE I KNOW

269
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,188
HOW IT FEELS."

270
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:02,189
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S JUST

271
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:04,124
TALKING OR IF HE'S FOR REAL.

272
00:07:04,124 --> 00:07:05,726
>> DOES HE HAVE HIS LICENSE

273
00:07:05,726 --> 00:07:06,727
OR ANYTHING?

274
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:07,895
>> NO, HE DOESN'T EVEN HAVE

275
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:09,362
HIS PERMIT YET.

276
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,398
>> HAS HE EVEN TRIED TO, LIKE,

277
00:07:11,398 --> 00:07:12,399
START LOOKING FOR A JOB

278
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:13,567
SINCE, LIKE, HE FOUND OUT

279
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:15,235
THAT YOU WERE PREGNANT?

280
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:16,904
>> NO, HE HASN'T.

281
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:18,405
HE'S 15, SO HE CAN'T REALLY

282
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:19,673
GET A JOB.

283
00:07:19,673 --> 00:07:21,174
>> BUT IF HE DOESN'T AGREE

284
00:07:21,174 --> 00:07:23,010
WITH ADOPTION, HE SHOULD REALLY,

285
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:23,844
YOU KNOW...

286
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:25,345
>> TRY TO MAKE ME CHANGE MY MIND

287
00:07:25,345 --> 00:07:27,180
AND KEEP EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

288
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,348
>> TRY TO PROVE TO YOU THAT

289
00:07:28,348 --> 00:07:29,850
YOU CAN MAKE IT.

290
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:30,851
>> YEAH.

291
00:07:30,851 --> 00:07:32,720
>> THERE'S ALWAYS A WAY, THOUGH.

292
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:33,386
>> YEAH.

293
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:34,387
>> HE'S JUST GONNA HAVE TO,

294
00:07:34,387 --> 00:07:35,723
LIKE, SUCK IT UP AND GET

295
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:36,389
THE JOB.

296
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,390
EVEN IF HE DOESN'T LIKE IT,

297
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:38,559
I MEAN, STILL BRING

298
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:40,027
SOMETHING IN.

299
00:07:40,027 --> 00:07:41,128
>> I DON'T KNOW IF I'M GONNA BE

300
00:07:41,128 --> 00:07:44,031
ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL, GRADUATE,

301
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:45,198
AND THEN GO TO COLLEGE,

302
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,034
GET MY VETERINARY MEDICINE

303
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:48,368
LICENSE AND ALL THAT

304
00:07:48,368 --> 00:07:49,570
WITH A BABY.

305
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:50,738
I DON'T THINK HE'S REALLY

306
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:52,405
THOUGHT ABOUT IT AND HOW

307
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:53,574
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE.

308
00:07:53,574 --> 00:07:54,742
I THINK HE'S JUST THOUGHT ABOUT

309
00:07:54,742 --> 00:07:56,243
THE FACT THAT HE HAS A CHILD

310
00:07:56,243 --> 00:07:57,244
NOW.

311
00:07:57,244 --> 00:07:59,212
HE JUST HASN'T THOUGHT, LIKE,

312
00:07:59,212 --> 00:08:00,213
"OH, WELL, I'M GONNA HAVE

313
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,381
A BABY, SO I NEED TO DO THIS

314
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:03,717
AND THIS AND THAT."

315
00:08:03,717 --> 00:08:07,287
HE HASN'T THOUGHT FORWARD.

316
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:08,956
WITHOUT ZAK'S SUPPORT,

317
00:08:08,956 --> 00:08:10,123
I DON'T KNOW HOW I'LL DECIDE

318
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:11,792
ABOUT ADOPTION.

319
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:13,694
PLUS, I'M STARTING A NEW SCHOOL

320
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:14,695
TODAY, AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT

321
00:08:14,695 --> 00:08:15,529
TO TELL THEM.

322
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:17,130
HOW SHOULD I DO MY MAKEUP?

323
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,131
AT LEAST I'M GONNA DO

324
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:19,466
MY EYEBROWS.

325
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:20,300
>> LEAVE THEM ALONE.

326
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:21,201
YOU'RE JUST GONNA BRING

327
00:08:21,201 --> 00:08:22,603
ATTENTION TO YOURSELF.

328
00:08:22,603 --> 00:08:23,604
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GONNA

329
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:25,438
HAPPEN NOW THAT YOU'RE SO BIG?

330
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:26,439
DO YOU THINK PEOPLE ARE GONNA

331
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,440
STARE AT YOU?

332
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,442
>> MAYBE A LITTLE BIT.

333
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:30,443
>> I WAS ALWAYS EMBARRASSED.

334
00:08:30,443 --> 00:08:31,411
I DIDN'T WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW

335
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:32,312
I WAS PREGNANT.

336
00:08:32,312 --> 00:08:35,382
>> YEAH, IT'S GONNA BOTHER ME.

337
00:08:38,218 --> 00:08:39,720
I CHOSE TO SWITCH TO A NEW

338
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,388
SCHOOL BECAUSE IF I DECIDE

339
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:42,723

THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL

00:08:46,727 --> 00:08:47,728
IS SUPPOSED TO BE AWKWARD

344
00:08:47,728 --> 00:08:49,229
BUT EVEN MORE SO WHEN YOU'RE

345
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:50,063
PREGNANT.

WE'RE GONNA DO THIS LITTLE

349
00:08:54,902 --> 00:08:55,569
ACTIVITY.

350
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:56,604

THIS YEAR?

354
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:00,340
OKAY, I WILL NOT ASK YOU

355
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,010
TO DO THIS TODAY--DOESN'T MEAN

356

YOU'RE SAFE ALL YEAR--

CLIFF?

359
00:09:09,349 --> 00:09:10,217
OH, I DEFINITELY WON'T

360
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,151

00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:34,642
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

378
00:09:34,642 --> 00:09:36,576
>> I HATE CRAP LIKE THAT.

379
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:38,078
>> I'M GLAD MY FIRST DAY

380
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,212
OF SCHOOL IS BEHIND ME,

381
00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:40,313
BUT ZAK AND I STILL NEED TO

382
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:41,815
FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO

383
00:09:41,815 --> 00:09:42,983
ABOUT THE BABY.

384
00:09:42,983 --> 00:09:44,151
IS IT NASTY?

385
00:09:44,151 --> 00:09:44,818
>> MM-MM.

386
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:45,986
>> SO HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW?

387
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:48,656
>> MMM...NOTHING.

388
00:09:48,656 --> 00:09:49,589
ARE YOU STILL CONSIDERING

389
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:50,490
ADOPTION?

390
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,992
>> YEAH.

391
00:09:51,992 --> 00:09:54,427
I'M JUST CONSIDERING MY OPTIONS.

392
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,763
I KNOW I CAN'T PROVIDE HIM

393
00:09:55,763 --> 00:10:00,100
WITH WHAT HE ACTUALLY NEEDS

394
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,101
ALL THE WAY.

395
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:02,369
>> HE GONNA HAVE TOYS.

396
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:03,336
HE GONNA HAVE WHAT HE NEEDS.

397
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:03,971
>> TOYS?

398
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:04,672
WHAT IS TOYS?

399
00:10:04,672 --> 00:10:05,538
HE NEEDS PAMPERS AND--

400
00:10:05,538 --> 00:10:06,473
>> HE GONNA HAVE PAMPERS.

401
00:10:06,473 --> 00:10:07,140
THAT'S NO--

402
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,142
>> I MEAN, WIPES AND BOTTLES.

403
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:10,143
>> YOU KNOW HE'S GONNA HAVE

404
00:10:10,143 --> 00:10:13,246
ALL THAT, MAN.

405
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:15,716
>> ARE YOU GONNA GET A JOB?

406
00:10:15,716 --> 00:10:17,217
>> I'M ONLY 15, AND YOU ACT LIKE

407
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:21,689
IT'S EASY TO GET A JOB AT 15.

408
00:10:21,689 --> 00:10:22,355
>> I MEAN--

409
00:10:22,355 --> 00:10:23,190
>> YOU JUST LOOKING

410
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:24,157
FOR EXCUSES TO GIVE HIM UP?

411
00:10:24,157 --> 00:10:25,092
>> NO, I'M TRYING TO TALK

412
00:10:25,092 --> 00:10:25,693
TO YOU.

413
00:10:25,693 --> 00:10:26,694
>> OKAY, WELL, I'M LISTENING.

414
00:10:26,694 --> 00:10:27,728
>> HOW ARE YOU GONNA BE AROUND

415
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:28,696
WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO SCHOOL

416
00:10:28,696 --> 00:10:29,562
AND FOOTBALL PRACTICE

417
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:30,530
AND BASKETBALL?

418
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,364
>> OKAY, SO WHAT?

419
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:32,332
YOU JUST WANT ME TO GIVE IT

420
00:10:32,332 --> 00:10:32,933
ALL UP?

421
00:10:32,933 --> 00:10:34,534
>> NO, THAT'S--I'M SAYING THAT--

422
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:35,703
HOW AM I GONNA BE ABLE TO DO

423
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:37,838
WHAT I NEED TO DO?

424
00:10:37,838 --> 00:10:38,872
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP

425
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:41,341
MY BABY, BUT I WANT TO GRADUATE,

426
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:42,342
AND I WANT TO GO TO

427
00:10:42,342 --> 00:10:43,610
A UNIVERSITY.

428
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:44,611
>> SO YOU JUST GONNA TAKE

429
00:10:44,611 --> 00:10:45,612
THE EASY WAY OUT?

430
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:46,947
>> ADOPTION'S ACTUALLY NOT

431
00:10:46,947 --> 00:10:48,381
THAT EASY.

432
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:49,382
YOU STILL HAVE ALL THAT

433
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,318
EMOTIONAL STRESS THAT IT'S GONNA

434
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:52,820
PUT YOU THROUGH, GIVING YOUR

435
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,788
BABY AWAY TO SOMEBODY.

436
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:56,123
>> YOU ALWAYS HAVE A CHOICE.

437
00:10:56,123 --> 00:10:57,791
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU CHOOSE TO DO,

438
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,292
THAT'S WHAT YOU CHOOSE TO DO.

439
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,293
YOU MIGHT GONNA REGRET IT

440
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:02,629
ONE DAY WHEN YOU GROWN.

441
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:04,164
>> [sniffles]

442
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:06,834
I'M NOT SURE.

443
00:11:06,834 --> 00:11:09,336
I DON'T KNOW IF I WANT TO DO

444
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,438
ADOPTION STILL, THOUGH.

445
00:11:11,438 --> 00:11:13,741
HONESTLY.

446
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,921
>> AFTER TALKING TO ZAK,

447
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:29,022
I'M MORE CONFUSED THAN EVER

448
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,190
ABOUT WHETHER I SHOULD CHOOSE

449
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,092
ADOPTION, AND WE NEED TO MAKE

450
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:34,427
A DECISION SOON, BECAUSE I'M DUE

451
00:11:34,427 --> 00:11:36,129
IN JUST SEVEN WEEKS.

452
00:11:36,129 --> 00:11:38,031
>> WHY ISN'T ZAK HERE?

453
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,733
>> HE COULDN'T LEAVE SCHOOL.

454
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:42,602
>> KIANNA?

455
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:45,005
>> WARM JELLY.

456
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:46,006
ALL RIGHT, THERE'S YOUR BABY'S

457
00:11:46,006 --> 00:11:47,607
HEART BEATING.

458
00:11:47,607 --> 00:11:48,942
WOULD YOU LIKE TO HEAR IT?

459
00:11:48,942 --> 00:11:51,678
>> YES.

461
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:57,350
OH...

462
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:58,819
>> [laughs]

463
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:00,320
THERE'S YOUR BABY'S FACE.

464
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,321
CAN YOU SEE IT?

465
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:02,155
>> YEAH.

466
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:03,723
>> HE'S LOOKING RIGHT AT US.

467
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,226
THAT'S HIS LITTLE NOSTRILS

468
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:11,664
AND HIS LIPS.

469
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:12,833
OH, THERE HE GOES,

470
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:15,836
STICKING HIS TONGUE OUT.

471
00:12:15,836 --> 00:12:17,004
>> OH!

472
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:18,505
[laughter]

473
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:20,373
LOOK AT HIS NOSE.

474
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:27,714
>> IT'S YOURS.

477
00:12:30,017 --> 00:12:30,784
LOOK AT HIS LIPS.

478
00:12:30,784 --> 00:12:31,751
THEY'RE SO POUTY.

479
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,253
>> THEY'RE LIKE...

480
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,587
>> THEY'RE GONNA BE BIG.

482
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:38,158
SEEING THESE PICTURES MAKES ME

483
00:12:38,158 --> 00:12:39,492
REALIZE HOW HARD IT WOULD BE

484
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:40,894
TO CHOOSE ADOPTION.

485
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:43,230
BUT BEFORE WE MAKE OUR DECISION,

486
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,564
I NEED TO SEE IF I CAN REALLY

487
00:12:44,564 --> 00:12:45,732
COUNT ON ZAK TO HELP SUPPORT

488
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:47,267
THE BABY.

489
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,101
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT

490
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:48,936
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

THE BABY, I JUST--

494
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:56,009
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'LL DO IT

495
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:57,344
EXACTLY.

496
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:58,678
>> I WOULD BE A BETTER DAD

497
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:00,914
THAN MY DAD WAS.

498
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:02,249
I HAVE FIVE MEMORIES THAT

499
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:04,051
I CAN THINK OF OF MY DAD

500
00:13:04,051 --> 00:13:08,021
OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD.

501
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:10,357
WITH MY SON, I WANT TO BE AROUND

502
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:12,092
FOR HIM.

503
00:13:12,092 --> 00:13:13,426
I WANT HIM TO HAVE

504
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:14,928
LOTS OF MEMORIES WITH ME,

505
00:13:14,928 --> 00:13:16,496
NOT JUST FIVE.

506
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:17,497
>> I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE

507
00:13:17,497 --> 00:13:18,198
COMING FROM.

LIKE, I REALLY DO.

509
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:21,468
BUT I'M NOT GONNA LET HAVING

510
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:23,303
A BABY RUIN MY DREAMS

511
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:24,471
AND MY GOALS FOR LIFE.

512
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:25,638
I DON'T WANT TO JUST GRADUATE

513
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:27,107
HIGH SCHOOL OR DROP OUT

514
00:13:27,107 --> 00:13:28,275
AND JUST WORK AT MCDONALD'S

515
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:29,609
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

516
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:30,777
I HONESTLY DON'T.

517
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:31,678
I WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL,

518
00:13:31,678 --> 00:13:32,512
AND I WANT TO BECOME

IN ANY WAY I CAN.

522
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:38,418
I'LL GET A JOB.

WHEN IT GETS HARD OR SOMETHING.

543
00:14:11,584 --> 00:14:13,921

IT WON'T BE EASY, ESPECIALLY

554
00:14:32,605 --> 00:14:34,607
SINCE ZAK LIVES SO FAR AWAY

AND DOESN'T HAVE A CAR,

556
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:40,313

00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:52,392
YOU AND ZAK?

565
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,627
>> WE'RE NOT GONNA DO ADOPTION.

566
00:14:54,627 --> 00:14:55,562
>> WHY AREN'T YOU GONNA DO

567
00:14:55,562 --> 00:14:56,696
THE ADOPTION?

568
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:57,864
>> 'CAUSE I DECIDED I WANT

569
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:59,199
MY SON.

570
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,533
>> WHAT MADE YOU DECIDE THAT

571
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:01,534
YOU WANTED HIM?

572
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:02,869
>> I THINK IT WAS JUST TIME.

573
00:15:02,869 --> 00:15:04,471
OVER TIME, I WAS LIKE,

574
00:15:04,471 --> 00:15:06,639
"I DON'T WANT TO DO IT."

575
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,977
AT FIRST, I MEAN, I WAS

576
00:15:09,977 --> 00:15:11,444
IN BETWEEN IT, AND, LIKE,

577
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:12,879
I DIDN'T REALLY CARE,

578
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:13,646
BUT NOW I'M LIKE,

579
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:15,215
"I WANT TO KEEP HIM."

580
00:15:15,215 --> 00:15:16,716
AND I NEEDED TO MAKE UP MY MIND,

581
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:18,651
BECAUSE IT'S NOT THAT LONG.

582
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:19,652
>> HOW ARE YOU GONNA PAY

583
00:15:19,652 --> 00:15:22,789
FOR THE BABY?

584
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,124
>> I HAVE, LIKE, $130.

585
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:25,792
IT'LL BE ENOUGH FOR TWO BOXES

586
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:28,128
OF DIAPERS.

587
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:29,296
>> [sighs]

588
00:15:29,296 --> 00:15:29,963
>> I KNOW.

589
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:31,131
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

590
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:32,632
WE NEED MONEY.

591
00:15:32,632 --> 00:15:33,800
>> MM-HMM.

592
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,801
>> ZAK AND I ARE GONNA HAVE

593
00:15:34,801 --> 00:15:36,136
TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GONNA

594
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:38,005
BE ABLE TO AFFORD THIS BABY.

595
00:15:38,005 --> 00:15:39,572
I'M HOPING MY MOM WILL

596
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:40,974
BE WILLING TO HELP OUT,

597
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:42,642
BUT I HAVEN'T TOLD HER ABOUT

598
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:44,144
OUR DECISION TO PARENT YET,

599
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:45,078
AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT HOW

600
00:15:45,078 --> 00:15:46,813
SHE'LL REACT.

601
00:15:46,813 --> 00:15:49,216
I'M NOT DOING ADOPTION.

602
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:51,118
>> SO WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE

603
00:15:51,118 --> 00:15:53,786
YOUR MIND?

604
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:55,922
>> I DON'T KNOW.

605
00:15:55,922 --> 00:15:58,291
I JUST CHANGED MY MIND.

606
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,126
>> THAT'S FINE.

607
00:15:59,126 --> 00:15:59,859
IT'S YOUR BABY.

608
00:15:59,859 --> 00:16:00,860
YOU CAN CHOOSE TO DO WHAT YOU

609
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:03,296
WANT TO DO WITH YOUR OWN CHILD.

610
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,464
YOU JUST REALIZE IT'S GONNA BE

611
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:05,498
A STRUGGLE FOR YOU, AND YOU'RE

612
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:06,499
JUST GONNA DO WHATEVER YOU CAN

613
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:07,534
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CAN DO

614
00:16:07,534 --> 00:16:08,768
THE BEST YOU CAN.

615
00:16:08,768 --> 00:16:10,603
>> MM-HMM.

616
00:16:10,603 --> 00:16:11,538
>> I THINK Y'ALL GOT A LOT

617
00:16:11,538 --> 00:16:12,772
OF TALKING TO DO.

618
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:13,773
HMM.

619
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:14,607
AND Y'ALL DON'T HAVE

620
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:16,243
A LOT OF TIME.

621
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:17,577
SO I MEAN, DO YOU HAVE

622
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:18,611
A PRIORITY LIST OF WHAT YOU

623
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:19,779
EXACTLY NEED RIGHT NOW

624
00:16:19,779 --> 00:16:20,780
AND WHAT YOU CAN DEAL WITH

625
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:21,581
FOR LATER?

626
00:16:21,581 --> 00:16:23,083
>> NO, WE--

627
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,217
>> OKAY, Y'ALL NEED TO COME UP

628
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:26,719
WITH A PLAN HERE OF EXACTLY

629
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,056
WHAT YOU NEED.

630
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:29,922
HOW MUCH DO Y'ALL HAVE

631
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,459
TO CONTRIBUTE TO ANY OF THIS?

632
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:33,460
>> I'M NOT SURE YET.

633
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:35,395
I HAVE $130 SOMETHING, THOUGH.

634
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:36,563
>> $130 IS NOT GONNA GO

635
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:37,630
VERY FAR.

636
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:39,466
Y'ALL GOT TO REALIZE THERE'S

637
00:16:39,466 --> 00:16:40,533
GONNA BE TIMES COMING UP THAT

638
00:16:40,533 --> 00:16:43,002
WE WON'T ALWAYS BE ABLE TO HELP.

639
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:43,903
I'M ALREADY IN THE HOLE

640
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:45,538
WITH KIANNA GOING TO THE DOCTOR.

641
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:48,041
Y'ALL MADE THIS SITUATION,

642
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,042
SO I DON'T WANT TO BE

643
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:50,710
A FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY

644
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:53,380
ON ME.

645
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:56,216
IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY

646
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:59,586
BEING A KID WITH A KID.

647
00:16:59,586 --> 00:17:01,588
IT'S HARD.

648
00:17:01,588 --> 00:17:03,623
IT'S A STRUGGLE.

649
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:04,524
I DID IT, SO I KNOW THAT

650
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:08,128
YOU CAN DO IT.

651
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:08,961
BUT LIKE I SAID,

652
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,997
IT'S GONNA TAKE A LOT.

653
00:17:19,172 --> 00:17:20,340
>> TALKING TO MY MOM MADE ME

654
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:21,674
REALIZE THAT WE NEED TO START

655
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:23,510
GETTING READY FOR THIS BABY.

656
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,011
MY NEW SCHOOL OFFERS DAY CARE,

657
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:26,346
SO THAT'S TAKEN CARE OF,

658
00:17:26,346 --> 00:17:27,414
AND WE EVEN PICKED OUT A NAME,

659
00:17:27,414 --> 00:17:28,715
KAY'DEN.

660
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:31,584
WE'VE BOTH APPLIED FOR JOBS,

661
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:37,390
BUT WE HAVEN'T HEARD BACK.

662
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,725
MY SCHOOL HAS A PARENTING CLASS

663
00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:40,527
FOR ALL THE PREGNANT STUDENTS,

664
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:41,694
AND I HAVE AN INTERESTING

665
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:42,862
HOMEWORK ASSIGNMENT.

666
00:17:42,862 --> 00:17:43,696
>> HEY, KIANNA.

667
00:17:43,696 --> 00:17:44,364
>> HI.

668
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:45,532
>> TODAY'S YOUR BIG DAY.

669
00:17:45,532 --> 00:17:47,334
IT'S YOUR BABY DELIVERY HERE.

670
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:48,168
HERE'S YOUR GIRL.

671
00:17:48,168 --> 00:17:49,202
>> YEAH.

672
00:17:49,202 --> 00:17:50,370
>> HERE IN THE BABY, IT'S GOT

673
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,704
THE COMPUTER IN IT, AND IT

674
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:53,039
RECORDS EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS.

675
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:53,706
>> OKAY.

676
00:17:53,706 --> 00:17:54,874
>> TAKE CARE OF THE BABY

677
00:17:54,874 --> 00:17:56,876
LIKE IT WAS A REAL LIVE BABY.

678
00:17:56,876 --> 00:17:58,545
IF YOU FAIL, YOU'LL STILL

679
00:17:58,545 --> 00:18:00,380
PASS THE CLASS.

680
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,314
I'LL BE VERY WORRIED ABOUT

681
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:02,215
YOUR REAL BABY.

682
00:18:02,215 --> 00:18:03,916
>> [laughing] YEAH.

683
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:04,917
>> I'M GONNA PUT THIS ON YOU.

684
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:05,552
>> OKAY.

685
00:18:05,552 --> 00:18:06,553
>> THIS MEANS YOU'RE A MOMMY

686
00:18:06,553 --> 00:18:07,320
FOR THE WEEKEND.

687
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:07,987
>> OKAY.

688
00:18:07,987 --> 00:18:08,988
>> THERE'S YOUR BABY.

689
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:10,657
>> THANK YOU.

690
00:18:10,657 --> 00:18:13,526
[mechanical crying]

691
00:18:13,526 --> 00:18:15,895
OKAY...

692
00:18:15,895 --> 00:18:17,230
THERE'S A LOT TO REMEMBER

693
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,565
WITH THIS BABY.

694
00:18:18,565 --> 00:18:19,799
MAYBE IT WILL TEACH US

695
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:20,800
WHAT WE'RE GONNA NEED TO DO

696
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,634
AS PARENTS.

697
00:18:21,634 --> 00:18:22,735
>> SO ARE WE REALLY TAKING THIS

698
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:23,570
TO THE RESTAURANT?

699
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:24,304
>> I HAVE TO.

700
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:25,405
IT'S MY GRADE.

701
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:26,573
>> WE SHOULD LEAVE THAT THING

702
00:18:26,573 --> 00:18:28,241
IN THE CAR.

703
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:29,276
>> IT'S NOT GONNA BE THAT BAD,

704
00:18:29,276 --> 00:18:29,842
ZAK.

705
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:31,178
>> LEAVE THE PHONE ON CALL.

706
00:18:31,178 --> 00:18:32,011
>> NO, NO.

707
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:33,180
>> WHEN IT START CRYING,

708
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,181
WE JUST RUN OUT TO THE CAR.

709
00:18:34,181 --> 00:18:35,182
>> NO, WE HAVE TO TAKE HIM--

710
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:36,683
TAKE HER WITH US.

711
00:18:36,683 --> 00:18:39,219
>> NO, I'M JUST PLAYING.

712
00:18:39,219 --> 00:18:40,220
CAN I HAVE A KISS?

713
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,721
[smacking lips]

714
00:18:41,721 --> 00:18:43,390
[mechanical crying]

715
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,491
OH, MY GOD.

716
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:45,925
I GOT HER.

717
00:18:45,925 --> 00:18:48,928
[mechanical crying]

718
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:49,996
>> HOLD HER HEAD.

00:18:49,996 --> 00:18:51,831
>> I'M HOLDING--[chuckles]

720

[mechanical crying]

723
00:18:58,371 --> 00:18:59,206
>> ROCK HER.

724
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:00,373
>> ROCK HER?

725
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:02,575
[mechanical crying]

726
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:03,910
IT'S NOT WORKING.

727
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:05,445
>> OKAY, NOW TRY THE BOTTLE.

728
00:19:05,445 --> 00:19:08,948
>> THERE WE GO.

729
00:19:08,948 --> 00:19:09,616
YOU WANNA--

00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:11,117
>> HOLD IT!

>> I MEAN, SHE'S STANDING UP.

732
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:12,919
IT'S NOT--

00:19:14,421 --> 00:19:16,423
>> OH, MY FOOD FELL TOO.

736
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:17,590
ALL RIGHT...

737
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,558
>> DO YOU THINK YOU'RE READY

738
00:19:18,558 --> 00:19:19,726
TO HAVE A REAL BABY?

739
00:19:19,726 --> 00:19:20,893
>> NO.

740
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:21,894
>> YOU DON'T KNOW?

741
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,062
>> I DON'T KNOW.

742
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:23,730
>> ARE YOU?

743
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:25,898
>> I'LL BE READY.

744
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:26,799
>> I'M GLAD ZAK'S TRYING

745
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,235
TO TAKE CARE OF THIS PLAY BABY,

746
00:19:28,235 --> 00:19:29,569
BUT I HOPE HE DOES A BETTER JOB

747
00:19:29,569 --> 00:19:32,372
WITH OUR SON.

748
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:37,210
MY DUE DATE IS THREE WEEKS AWAY,

749
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,711
AND MY FEET ARE GETTING

750
00:19:38,711 --> 00:19:39,712
VERY SWOLLEN.

751
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:41,214
I HAVE MY WEEKLY CHECKUP TODAY,

752
00:19:41,214 --> 00:19:42,382
SO HOPEFULLY THE DOCTOR

753
00:19:42,382 --> 00:19:43,883
WILL BE ABLE TO HELP ME.

754
00:19:43,883 --> 00:19:45,718
>> HI, KIANNA, HOW ARE YOU?

755
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:46,719
>> GOOD.

756
00:19:46,719 --> 00:19:47,754
>> HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

757
00:19:47,754 --> 00:19:48,755
>> MY FEET HURT.

758
00:19:48,755 --> 00:19:49,689
>> GO AHEAD AND LEAN BACK

759
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:51,157
FOR ME.

760
00:19:51,157 --> 00:19:52,158
I WANT TO FEEL HOW SWOLLEN

761
00:19:52,158 --> 00:19:53,493
YOUR LEGS ARE.

762
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:55,161
WOW.

763
00:19:55,161 --> 00:19:56,929
OKAY.

764
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:57,930
GIRLS THAT ARE REALLY YOUNG

765
00:19:57,930 --> 00:19:58,931
WHEN THEY GET PREGNANT

766
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,267
CAN BE AT RISK FOR LOTS OF

767
00:20:00,267 --> 00:20:01,634
DIFFERENT COMPLICATIONS DURING

768
00:20:01,634 --> 00:20:02,469
THE PREGNANCY.

769
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:03,403
YOU KNOW, THE CONCERN IS,

770
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:04,271
WITH ALL THE SWELLING

771
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:05,238
YOU'RE HAVING IN YOUR LEGS,

772
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:06,339
IS WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE TRYING

773
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:07,274
TO GET PREECLAMPSIA.

774
00:20:07,274 --> 00:20:08,107
>> MM-HMM.

775
00:20:08,107 --> 00:20:10,943
>> SO WHAT IS PREECLAMPSIA?

776
00:20:10,943 --> 00:20:12,111
>> WHAT THAT IS, IS A CONDITION

777
00:20:12,111 --> 00:20:13,079
WHERE IT AFFECTS YOUR BLOOD

778
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:14,314
PRESSURE, AND IT MAKES YOU HAVE

779
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:15,815
PROTEIN IN YOUR URINE.

780
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:17,317
WOMEN SOMETIMES GET REALLY

781
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:18,150
SWOLLEN.

782
00:20:18,150 --> 00:20:19,486
AND THE THING THAT'S DANGEROUS

783
00:20:19,486 --> 00:20:20,487
ABOUT IT IS THAT IT CAN BE

784
00:20:20,487 --> 00:20:21,988
DANGEROUS FOR YOUR BABY.

785
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:23,656
SO I THINK THAT PROBABLY

786
00:20:23,656 --> 00:20:25,091
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO

787
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:26,426
IS LET YOU DO A 24-HOUR

788
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:27,927
URINE COLLECTION AT HOME, OKAY?

789
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:28,595
>> MM-HMM.

790
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:29,562
>> WE'RE GONNA SEND YOU HOME

791
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,229
WITH A JUG.

792
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,230
YOU NEED TO KEEP IT IN A COOL,

793
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,198
DARK PLACE, LIKE THE FRIDGE.

794
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:33,366
>> [laughing] OKAY.

795
00:20:33,366 --> 00:20:34,534
>> LABEL IT.

796
00:20:34,534 --> 00:20:35,201
I KNOW.

797
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:36,503
IT'S KIND OF GROSS, HUH?

798
00:20:36,503 --> 00:20:38,070
>> SO AM I ABLE TO GO TO SCHOOL?

799
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,771
>> NOT YET.

800
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:39,772
FIRST, WE NEED TO HAVE YOU DO

801
00:20:39,772 --> 00:20:40,507
MORE LAB TESTS.

802
00:20:40,507 --> 00:20:41,474
AND WE'LL DECIDE IF WE NEED

803
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:42,709
TO ADMIT YOU TO THE HOSPITAL.

804
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:43,376
>> OKAY.

805
00:20:43,376 --> 00:20:44,344
>> BUT LET'S MAKE SURE YOUR

806
00:20:44,344 --> 00:20:45,244
KIDNEYS ARE WORKING OKAY

807
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:46,178
AND MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S

808
00:20:46,178 --> 00:20:46,946
DOING OKAY.

809
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:47,880
BUT I THINK WE CAN DO THAT

810
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,416
WHILE YOU'RE AT HOME, OKAY?

811
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:51,284
>> OKAY.

812
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:58,458
I'M JUST SCARED FOR EVERYTHING.

813
00:20:58,458 --> 00:20:59,459
I DON'T WANT TO BE ADMITTED

814
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:01,328
INTO THE HOSPITAL.

815
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:06,833
[pan sizzling]

816
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,335
AFTER WE LEFT, THE DOCTOR CALLED

817
00:21:08,335 --> 00:21:09,336
MY MOM AND TOLD HER THEY WERE

818
00:21:09,336 --> 00:21:11,170
TESTING ME, AND IF I SHOW SIGNS

819
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,172
OF PREECLAMPSIA, THEY MIGHT HAVE

820
00:21:13,172 --> 00:21:14,507
TO INDUCE LABOR.

821
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:15,908
>> I ASKED HER, I SAID,

822
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:16,776
"WILL THEY INDUCE HER

823
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:17,510
AUTOMATICALLY?"

824
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,745
AND SHE SAID THAT IT'D JUST

825
00:21:18,745 --> 00:21:20,246
DEPEND ON HOW YOU DID.

826
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:21,414
IT'S NOT EVEN THAT, 'CAUSE,

827
00:21:21,414 --> 00:21:23,249
YOU KNOW, IF THEY HAVE TO INDUCE

828
00:21:23,249 --> 00:21:24,150
YOU, THAT MEANS THE BABY

829
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,151
IS GONNA BE HERE EARLIER THAN

830
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:26,152
WHAT WE WANTED.

831
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:27,320
WE DON'T HAVE THE CRIB.

832
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,187
I MEAN, WE NEED EXTRA

833
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:29,589
BOTTLES AND DIAPERS.

834
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:30,623
IT'S LIKE WE'RE GONNA BE RUSHING

835
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:32,024
TO TRY TO GET ALL THIS STUFF.

836
00:21:32,024 --> 00:21:33,526
THAT'S WHAT WORRIES ME.

837
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:34,861
YOUR DOCTOR SAID SHE WANTED

838
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:37,096
TO PUT YOU ON HOMEBOUND,

839
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:38,064
'CAUSE YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

840
00:21:38,064 --> 00:21:38,965
ON BED REST.

841
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:42,802
>> I KNOW...

842
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:45,304
I GOT TO USE THE RESTROOM.

843
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,575
>> GO PEE IN YOUR JUG, KIANNA.

844
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:49,742
>> IT'S GETTING HEAVY.

845
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:51,077
>> YOU LOOK LIKE A HILLBILLY.

846
00:21:51,077 --> 00:21:53,580
YOU LITERALLY HAVE A PEE POT.

847
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,246
>> EW...

848
00:21:54,246 --> 00:21:55,415
YEAH, THAT'S IN YOUR

849
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:57,016
REFRIGERATOR.

850
00:21:57,016 --> 00:21:59,486
FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS, WHILE

851
00:21:59,486 --> 00:22:01,320
EVERYONE ELSE IS AT SCHOOL...

852
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,154
crash!

853
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,322
I HAVE TO STAY ON BED REST

854
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,693
AND FILL UP THIS JUG.

855
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:08,561
HELLO?

856
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:09,496
I KNOW YOU JUST CALLED ME,

857
00:22:09,496 --> 00:22:11,330
BUT I GOT TO USE THE RESTROOM.

858
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:12,231
I'M GONNA CALL YOU BACK

859
00:22:12,231 --> 00:22:14,467
WHEN I'M DONE.

860

[water running]

861
00:22:15,935 --> 00:22:17,269
MOM, IT'S GETTING HEAVIER

862
00:22:17,269 --> 00:22:18,938
AND HEAVIER.

863
00:22:18,938 --> 00:22:20,239
>> THANK YOU FOR EXPRESSING THAT

864
00:22:20,239 --> 00:22:20,907
TO ME.

865
00:22:20,907 --> 00:22:21,841
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO SEE:

866
00:22:21,841 --> 00:22:24,010
A JUG FULL OF PEE.

867
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:29,015
[toilet flushing]

868
00:22:32,819 --> 00:22:34,220
>> IT'S TIME TO BRING THIS JUG

869
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,222
BACK TO THE DOCTOR AND MAKE SURE

870
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:37,624
EVERYTHING IS HEALTHY,

871
00:22:37,624 --> 00:22:38,591
BUT I HAVE TO WAIT TWO DAYS

872
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:39,692
FOR THE RESULTS.

873
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:40,860
THANK YOU.

874
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,695
BYE.

[phone ringing]

876
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:46,766
HELLO?

877
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:49,101
>> HI, IS THIS KIANNA?

878
00:22:49,101 --> 00:22:50,937
>> YES, THIS IS HER.

879
00:22:50,937 --> 00:22:52,839
>> HI, KIANNA.

880
00:22:52,839 --> 00:22:54,006
I'VE JUST RECEIVED SOME OF YOUR

881
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:55,942
RESULTS FROM THE URINE TEST,

882
00:22:55,942 --> 00:22:57,444
AND IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE STILL

883
00:22:57,444 --> 00:23:00,279
AT RISK FOR PREECLAMPSIA,

884
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:01,614
AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT

885
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:02,615
AND THE RISK TO YOU

886
00:23:02,615 --> 00:23:04,451
AND POSSIBLY THE BABY,

887
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:06,118
I THINK IT'S BEST AT THIS TIME

888
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:07,954
THAT WE DON'T WAIT ANY FURTHER,

889
00:23:07,954 --> 00:23:09,288
AND WE WOULD LIKE TO JUST

890
00:23:09,288 --> 00:23:11,458
INDUCE YOU.

891
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:13,560
>> MM, OKAY.

892
00:23:13,560 --> 00:23:15,394
WHEN WILL I BE INDUCED?

893
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:16,328
>> WELL, I WOULD LIKE YOU

894
00:23:16,328 --> 00:23:17,229
TO COME TO THE HOSPITAL

895
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:20,232
THIS AFTERNOON.

896
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,400
>> OKAY.

OF PREECLAMPSIA, WHICH COULD

901
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:42,188
PUT ME AND MY BABY AT RISK.

902
00:23:42,188 --> 00:23:43,523
SO EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT DUE

903
00:23:43,523 --> 00:23:45,357
FOR THREE WEEKS, MY DOCTORS

904
00:23:45,357 --> 00:23:47,293
ARE INDUCING LABOR TONIGHT.

>> I DON'T THINK

922
00:24:17,857 --> 00:24:21,027
IT'S GONNA HELP.

923
00:24:21,027 --> 00:24:22,695
I'M STARTING TO FEEL

924
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:23,796
CONTRACTIONS, AND THEY

925
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:25,965
REALLY HURT.

926
00:24:25,965 --> 00:24:27,299

927
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,503
>> MM-HMM.

928
00:24:30,503 --> 00:24:32,004
THE PAIN IS GETTING WORSE,

929

BUT THE BABY IS STILL NOT READY

930
00:24:33,506 --> 00:24:34,541
TO COME OUT.

931
00:24:34,541 --> 00:24:35,875

>> JUST BREATHE.

00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,172
KAY'DEN IS GOING TO DAY CARE

1310
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:15,341
WHILE I'M IN CLASS.

1311
00:36:15,341 --> 00:36:16,675
IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY HARD

1312
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,377
TO BE APART FROM HIM ALL DAY.

1313
00:36:18,377 --> 00:36:19,578
>> GOOD MORNING.

1314
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:21,613
HI.

1315
00:36:21,613 --> 00:36:23,782
>> MWAH!

1316
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:25,617
>> ALL RIGHT, WELL, WE PROMISE

1317
00:36:25,617 --> 00:36:26,785
TO TAKE GOOD CARE OF HIM.

1318
00:36:26,785 --> 00:36:28,620
>> I KNOW.

1319
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,456
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE GREAT

1320
00:36:30,456 --> 00:36:31,690
TO SEE MY FRIENDS TODAY,

1321
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,725
BUT I'M EXHAUSTED, AND IT'S HARD

1322
00:36:33,725 --> 00:36:35,727
TO ADMIT HOW OVERWHELMED I FEEL.

1323
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:37,229
>> HOW ARE THINGS GOING AT HOME?

1324
00:36:37,229 --> 00:36:38,564
>> IT'S OKAY.

1325
00:36:38,564 --> 00:36:39,898
>> DO YOU SLEEP OFTEN?

1326
00:36:39,898 --> 00:36:41,600
>> I TRY.

1327
00:36:41,600 --> 00:36:42,501
>> YOU GOT TO SLEEP WHEN

1328
00:36:42,501 --> 00:36:43,235
KAY'DEN SLEEPS.

1329
00:36:43,235 --> 00:36:43,935
>> MM-HMM.

1330
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:45,271
>> WITH ALL THE DIAPER BUYING

1331
00:36:45,271 --> 00:36:46,938
AND FOOD, WHERE DO YOU GET,

1332
00:36:46,938 --> 00:36:49,107
LIKE, THE MONEY TO DO ALL THAT?

1333
00:36:49,107 --> 00:36:50,609
>> MY MOM HELPS OUT A LOT.

1334
00:36:50,609 --> 00:36:52,311
AND THEN, LIKE, SHE DOESN'T

1335
00:36:52,311 --> 00:36:53,479
HAVE MONEY AS IT IS, AND SHE

1336
00:36:53,479 --> 00:36:54,780
STILL DOES IT.

1337
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:55,781
>> IS ZAK NOT HELPING HER

1338
00:36:55,781 --> 00:36:56,715
WITH IT OR ANYTHING?

1339
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:57,483
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1340
00:36:57,483 --> 00:36:58,617
BUT HE SHOULD BE.

1341
00:36:58,617 --> 00:37:00,719
>> SO ARE YOU HAPPY?

1342
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:01,553
>> IT'S NOT THE SAME

1343
00:37:01,553 --> 00:37:02,921
AS IT USED TO BE.

1344
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:04,356
IT'S DIFFERENT.

1345
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:06,725
IT'S NOT MISERABLE OR NOTHING.

1346
00:37:06,725 --> 00:37:08,394
BUT I WISH THAT ZAK WAS AROUND

1347
00:37:08,394 --> 00:37:09,160
MORE.

1348
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,663
>> YEAH.

1349
00:37:11,663 --> 00:37:12,831
>> NOW THAT I'M BACK IN SCHOOL,

1350
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:14,165
IT'S EVEN MORE IMPORTANT

1351
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:15,033
FOR ZAK TO HELP ME OUT

1352
00:37:15,033 --> 00:37:15,834
WITH THE BABY.

1353
00:37:15,834 --> 00:37:17,336
HOPEFULLY THIS TIME,

1354
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:18,670
HE'LL LISTEN TO ME.

1355
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:20,372
DURING THE WEEK, I WISH YOU WERE

1356
00:37:20,372 --> 00:37:22,173
THERE, BECAUSE IT'S HARDER

1357
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:23,342
THAN WHEN YOU'RE NOT THERE.

1358
00:37:23,342 --> 00:37:24,543
LIKE, MY DAYS ARE HARDER,

1359
00:37:24,543 --> 00:37:26,878
BECAUSE I WAKE UP EARLIER,

1360
00:37:26,878 --> 00:37:28,547
LIKE, AT 6:00, AND I FEED

1361
00:37:28,547 --> 00:37:29,715
KAY'DEN, AND SOMETIMES,

1362
00:37:29,715 --> 00:37:30,716
AFTER I FEED HIM, HE DOESN'T

1363
00:37:30,716 --> 00:37:31,717
WANT TO GO BACK TO SLEEP.

1364
00:37:31,717 --> 00:37:33,218
SO I'M SITTING THERE

1365
00:37:33,218 --> 00:37:35,053
TRYING TO MAKE HIM GO TO SLEEP.

1366
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:36,388
I JUST THINK THAT, LIKE,

1367
00:37:36,388 --> 00:37:38,056
I GET MAD SOMETIMES

1368
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:41,226
BECAUSE I'M TIRED,

1369
00:37:41,226 --> 00:37:42,694
BECAUSE OF ALL THE THINGS

1370
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:43,695
THAT I'M DOING AT THE HOUSE

1371
00:37:43,695 --> 00:37:45,196
BY MYSELF, AND THAT MAKES ME

1372
00:37:45,196 --> 00:37:46,332
ANGRY.

1373
00:37:46,332 --> 00:37:47,333
>> I HELP OUT THE WAY I CAN.

1374
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:48,334
>> I KNOW YOU HELP OUT

1375
00:37:48,334 --> 00:37:49,100
THE WAY YOU CAN.

1376
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:49,968
>> IF I COULD BE THERE

1377
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:50,669
EVERY DAY...

1378
00:37:50,669 --> 00:37:51,537
>> YOU WOULD BE THERE.

1379
00:37:51,537 --> 00:37:52,170
>> YEAH.

1380
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,204
SO IT'S NOT LIKE I'M NOT DOING

1381
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:53,939
NOTHING AT ALL.

1382
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:55,040
>> I KNOW, BUT THEN EVEN THOUGH

1383
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:55,974
IT'S JUST ME AND THE BABY,

1384
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:57,042
I WISH THAT YOU COULD BE THERE

1385
00:37:57,042 --> 00:37:59,210
WITH US 24/7 TOO, LIKE,

1386
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,546
SO WE COULD BE A FAMILY,

1387
00:38:00,546 --> 00:38:01,647
INSTEAD OF JUST BEING A FAMILY

1388
00:38:01,647 --> 00:38:03,815
JUST ON THE WEEKENDS.

1389
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:05,484
>> * AS I WALK *

1390
00:38:05,484 --> 00:38:06,985
* ABOVE THE PAIN *

1391
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:08,654
* I CAN FEEL YOU *

1392
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:09,655
* WALKING WITH ME *

1393
00:38:09,655 --> 00:38:11,323
* CARRYING ME *

1394
00:38:11,323 --> 00:38:12,658
>> I HOPE THAT IN THE FUTURE,

1395
00:38:12,658 --> 00:38:14,159
THAT ME AND ZAK, WE CAN STAY

1396
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:15,494
TOGETHER AND WE CAN RAISE

1397
00:38:15,494 --> 00:38:17,329
KAY'DEN HOW HE SHOULD BE RAISED.

1398
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:19,565
>> "DADDY'S CHANGED ME WEIRD."

1399
00:38:19,565 --> 00:38:20,632
>> [laughs]

1400
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,167
HE WANTS TO BE HERE FOR THE BABY

1401
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:23,835
BECAUSE HE KNOWS HOW HARD IT IS

1402
00:38:23,835 --> 00:38:25,404
WITHOUT A FATHER.

1403
00:38:25,404 --> 00:38:28,374
WITH ZAK NOT HAVING A JOB,

1404
00:38:28,374 --> 00:38:29,375
IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE HE CAN'T

1405
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:32,043
REALLY SUPPORT US FINANCIALLY.

1406
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:33,545
HE IS NOT ABLE TO SIT THERE

1407
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:35,714
AND GIVE US MONEY, SO I FEEL

1408
00:38:35,714 --> 00:38:36,715
LIKE HE NEEDS TO GET A JOB

1409
00:38:36,715 --> 00:38:38,550
AS SOON AS HE CAN.

1410
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,385
>> HE'S 16.

1411
00:38:39,385 --> 00:38:40,552
IS HE LOOKING FOR A JOB

1412
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:41,219
FOR SURE?

1413
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:43,188
DO YOU SEE HIM FILL THINGS OUT?

1414
00:38:43,188 --> 00:38:44,122
>> NOT YET.

1415
00:38:44,122 --> 00:38:45,957
SINCE HAVING THE BABY, MY LIFE

1416
00:38:45,957 --> 00:38:47,926
HAS CHANGED IN MANY WAYS.

1417
00:38:47,926 --> 00:38:49,928
BASICALLY, I AM ON MY OWN.

1418
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:51,597
>> YOU DO HAVE SEVERAL ABSENCES

1419
00:38:51,597 --> 00:38:53,264
SO FAR FROM THIS SCHOOL YEAR

1420
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:54,099
ALREADY.

1421
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:55,100
HOPEFULLY YOUR ATTENDANCE

1422
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,101
WILL BE A LITTLE BIT BETTER.

1423
00:38:56,101 --> 00:38:56,868
>> YEAH, IT WILL.

1424
00:38:56,868 --> 00:38:57,936
MY MAIN GOAL RIGHT NOW

1425
00:38:57,936 --> 00:39:00,105
IS TO GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL,

1426
00:39:00,105 --> 00:39:01,106
AND I DON'T WANT HAVING A BABY

1427
00:39:01,106 --> 00:39:02,774
TO STOP ME FROM GRADUATING.

1428
00:39:02,774 --> 00:39:04,109
EVEN THOUGH IT'S HARD FOR ME

1429
00:39:04,109 --> 00:39:05,611
TO SIT HERE AND WAKE UP EVERY

1430
00:39:05,611 --> 00:39:07,112
MORNING AND GO TO SCHOOL

1431
00:39:07,112 --> 00:39:08,313
AND WORK VERY HARD,

1432
00:39:08,313 --> 00:39:11,383
I'M GONNA DO IT REGARDLESS.

1433
00:39:11,383 --> 00:39:12,718
I DO WISH THAT ME AND ZAK

1434
00:39:12,718 --> 00:39:13,885
WOULD HAVE WAITED

1435
00:39:13,885 --> 00:39:15,053
OR BEEN MORE RESPONSIBLE,

1436
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,054
SO THAT WE COULD STILL HAVE

1437
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:17,523
OUR TEENAGE LIVES.

1438
00:39:17,523 --> 00:39:18,524
I MISS YOU.

1439
00:39:18,524 --> 00:39:20,191
LIKE, IT WAS ALWAYS ME AND YOU

1440
00:39:20,191 --> 00:39:21,460
ALL THE TIME.

1441
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,028
NOW IT'S, LIKE, I DON'T EVEN GET

1442
00:39:23,028 --> 00:39:24,195
TO REALLY SEE YOU OR TALK

1443
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,765
TO YOU.

1444
00:39:26,765 --> 00:39:28,266
I WASN'T READY TO HAVE A BABY.

1445
00:39:28,266 --> 00:39:29,435
I DON'T THINK MY LIFE

1446
00:39:29,435 --> 00:39:30,602
WAS IN PLACE IN ORDER

1447
00:39:30,602 --> 00:39:31,970
FOR ME TO HAVE A BABY.

1448
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:32,971
>> YOU LOOK SO TIRED.

1449
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:34,005
WHY ARE YOU SO TIRED?

1450
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:34,873
>> 'CAUSE I AM TIRED.

1451
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:35,841
BEEN UP ALL DAY.

1452
00:39:35,841 --> 00:39:37,008
I HOPE THAT I CAN ACHIEVE

1453
00:39:37,008 --> 00:39:39,711
MY GOALS LIKE GOING TO COLLEGE,

1454
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:40,946
GETTING MY VETERINARY MEDICINE

1455
00:39:40,946 --> 00:39:42,748
LICENSE, STAYING WITH ZAK,

1456
00:39:42,748 --> 00:39:45,183
AND RAISING A GOOD, HEALTHY BOY.

1457
00:39:45,183 --> 00:39:46,184
JUST CONTINUE TO WORK HARD

1458
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:48,554
IN LIFE AND MAKE THE BEST OF IT.

www.captionmax.com

1461
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:07,305
>> SO I'M GUESSING YOU'RE MOM

1462
00:40:07,305 --> 00:40:09,240
WASN'T REALLY HAPPY ABOUT IT.

1463
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,976
>> NO, SHE WASN'T HAPPY AT ALL.

1464
00:40:10,976 --> 00:40:12,611
>> I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU GIVE

1465
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:14,245
THE CHILD UP FOR ADOPTION.

1466
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,781
>> I JUST DON'T LIKE THE IDEA.

1467
00:40:15,781 --> 00:40:18,083
>> KIDS SHOULD NOT HAVE KIDS.

1468
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:19,384
>> WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY

1469
00:40:19,384 --> 00:40:20,752
IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS.

1470
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,287
OH, MY GOD.

1471
00:40:22,287 --> 00:40:23,789
>> I DO EVERYTHING AROUND HERE.

1472
00:40:23,789 --> 00:40:25,423
>> YOU TAKE OUT TRASH.

1473
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,224
>> SHUT UP.

1474
00:40:26,224 --> 00:40:27,258
GOD, YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

1475
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,594
>> HE NEEDS TO STEP UP AND BE

1476
00:40:28,594 --> 00:40:29,695
A BETTER DAD.

1477
00:40:29,695 --> 00:40:30,662
>> THE ONLY REASON WE STAY

1478
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:32,531
TOGETHER IS BECAUSE OF HER.
