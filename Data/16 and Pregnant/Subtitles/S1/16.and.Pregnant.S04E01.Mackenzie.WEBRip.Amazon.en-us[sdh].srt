1
00:00:03,555 --> 00:00:06,075
Someone'’s got to get
that pony tamed.

2
00:00:06,282 --> 00:00:07,731
Hi, I'’m Mackenzie.

3
00:00:08,215 --> 00:00:11,149
I'’m 16 and live
in Miami, Oklahoma.

4
00:00:11,321 --> 00:00:13,392
When I'’m not outside
riding horses,

5
00:00:13,392 --> 00:00:15,601
you can find me
inside at the gym.

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:18,018
Competitive
cheerleading is my life.

7
00:00:18,087 --> 00:00:18,949
[Girl]
Good one.

8
00:00:19,157 --> 00:00:20,503
And since I'’m planning

9
00:00:20,503 --> 00:00:22,608
to cheer in college when
I graduate in two years,

10
00:00:22,677 --> 00:00:25,956
I'’m always trying to stick
the most dangerous stunts.

11
00:00:25,956 --> 00:00:29,512
Until then, I live at home
with my mom, dad,

12
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:31,617
two sisters, and brother.

13
00:00:31,617 --> 00:00:32,101
Touchdown!

14
00:00:32,584 --> 00:00:33,757
I'’m in the end zone!

15
00:00:33,826 --> 00:00:35,621
Even though we'’re
all super close,

16
00:00:35,621 --> 00:00:38,279
it'’s my boyfriend Josh
who really gets me.

17
00:00:38,486 --> 00:00:40,074
Don'’t throw it that hard.

18
00:00:40,074 --> 00:00:42,732
He'’s an adrenaline junkie too
and rides bulls.

19
00:00:42,732 --> 00:00:44,734
But since he'’s had
a few concussions,

20
00:00:44,734 --> 00:00:46,839
he mainly rides
wild horses now,

21
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:49,601
but still competes
in all the local rodeos.

22
00:00:49,601 --> 00:00:50,602
You go, boy.

23
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:52,328
We'’re totally in love.

24
00:00:52,466 --> 00:00:54,744
Although we'’re both really
busy, we'’re gonna have to start

25
00:00:54,813 --> 00:00:57,160
spending more time
together soon,

26
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,267
because I'’m pregnant.

27
00:01:06,652 --> 00:01:08,378
My due date is four months away,

28
00:01:08,378 --> 00:01:10,898
and even though there'’s a lot
to plan for with the baby...

29
00:01:10,967 --> 00:01:12,555
Look for seats down there.

30
00:01:12,555 --> 00:01:14,074
Summer'’s almost over,

31
00:01:14,143 --> 00:01:16,904
and my friends
and I never miss a rodeo.

32
00:01:18,354 --> 00:01:19,803
Look, your first rodeo.

33
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:21,943
[laughing]

34
00:01:22,323 --> 00:01:23,152
Whoo!

35
00:01:23,221 --> 00:01:25,257
[laughs]

36
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:30,883
Tomorrow?

37
00:01:31,263 --> 00:01:32,402
I don'’t want to watch it.

38
00:01:32,402 --> 00:01:33,783

Does it scare you?

39
00:01:34,163 --> 00:01:35,267
Yeah.

40
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,892
I don'’t want a dead
baby'’s daddy.

41
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,446
[laughs]
Mackenzie.

42
00:01:43,033 --> 00:01:44,069
Josh.

43
00:01:45,208 --> 00:01:46,416
Want to say thank you to...

44
00:01:46,485 --> 00:01:48,660
[speaking indistinctly]

45
00:01:50,317 --> 00:01:50,938
Yeah.

46
00:01:51,732 --> 00:01:53,872
Josh, I think I kiss
Mackenzie more than you.

47
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:56,668
Mwah!

48
00:01:57,047 --> 00:01:58,359
Fun, huh?

49
00:01:58,566 --> 00:01:59,671
[laughing]

50
00:02:00,292 --> 00:02:03,192
My friends were pretty shocked
to find out I was pregnant,

51
00:02:03,192 --> 00:02:05,780
especially since I had
big goals this year

52
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:07,713
to win state in tumbling.

53
00:02:07,713 --> 00:02:09,474
Although I need
to find a job soon,

54
00:02:09,474 --> 00:02:12,718
I'’m still determined to go
to as many practices as I can,

55
00:02:12,718 --> 00:02:14,789
so I don'’t fall too far behind.

56
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,343
Sorry, I caught.
Sorry.

57
00:02:16,343 --> 00:02:16,860
No, you'’re good.

58
00:02:17,171 --> 00:02:17,896
That was good.

59
00:02:17,896 --> 00:02:18,483
Hey, squad.

60
00:02:18,621 --> 00:02:19,518
Whoo-hoo!

61
00:02:19,587 --> 00:02:20,830
What'’s up, Mackenzie?

62
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,073
You girls ready?

63
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:24,592
Come on, Cheyenne. Let'’s go.
Kick it.

64
00:02:24,592 --> 00:02:27,319
Let'’s go. Push. Push.
Get there.

65
00:02:27,388 --> 00:02:28,596
Yeah.

66
00:02:30,426 --> 00:02:32,186
That'’ll work.
Handspring back.

67
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:34,602
Let'’s go. Push. Push.
Stand up.

68
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:35,741
There you go.
Good job.

69
00:02:35,741 --> 00:02:36,673
[Mackenzie]
Yay.

70
00:02:36,811 --> 00:02:38,779
This is making me depressed.

71
00:02:38,848 --> 00:02:40,021
Oh.

72
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:41,195
I feel so bad.

73
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:42,886
I just hope I can
do this stuff again.

74
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:45,303
I hope I can get
back into that body.

75
00:02:45,648 --> 00:02:47,581
That was me
before I got pregnant.

76
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,376
[both laugh]

77
00:02:49,445 --> 00:02:50,480
Awesome.

78
00:02:50,549 --> 00:02:51,550
You guys want to corner up?

79
00:02:51,792 --> 00:02:52,965
You should jump in soon.

80
00:02:53,276 --> 00:02:54,726
So what'’s the plan
after the baby comes?

81
00:02:54,726 --> 00:02:56,176
Are you gonna be back
cheerleading?

82
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,315
Heck yeah, I am.

83
00:02:57,315 --> 00:02:58,212
[laughs]

84
00:02:58,419 --> 00:02:59,213
Have you thought about, like,

85
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:00,732
what that'’s gonna be
like to have to cheer and--

86
00:03:01,664 --> 00:03:02,458
I don'’t care.
I'’m gonna do it.

87
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:03,148
One way or another.

88
00:03:03,528 --> 00:03:04,114
When is
your baby due?

89
00:03:04,114 --> 00:03:04,632
October 9th.

90
00:03:04,701 --> 00:03:05,426
October.

91
00:03:05,495 --> 00:03:06,255
Okay.

92
00:03:06,876 --> 00:03:08,049
[Matt]
But if you'’re cheerleading,

93
00:03:08,049 --> 00:03:09,637
who'’s gonna watch the baby?

94
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:12,226
Yeah, cheer used to be your
number one priority

95
00:03:12,295 --> 00:03:13,227
but not anymore.

96
00:03:13,227 --> 00:03:14,263
It'’s my number two.

97
00:03:14,263 --> 00:03:15,125
[laughs]

98
00:03:15,298 --> 00:03:16,368
And Josh is number three.

99
00:03:16,368 --> 00:03:17,921
[laughter]

100
00:03:18,301 --> 00:03:19,958
I still have not met Josh.

101
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,718
He'’s busy with rodeos.

102
00:03:21,718 --> 00:03:23,306
[Matt]
Is he a junior also?

103
00:03:23,306 --> 00:03:24,376
He'’s graduated.

104
00:03:25,032 --> 00:03:26,413
Are you gonna try to cheer
for the high school, or...

105
00:03:26,482 --> 00:03:27,862
Yeah.

106
00:03:27,862 --> 00:03:28,967
I'’ll show you
I'’m still flexible.

107
00:03:29,657 --> 00:03:30,865
Seriously.

108
00:03:31,797 --> 00:03:32,419
[Cody]
All the way up?

109
00:03:32,419 --> 00:03:33,558
Yeah, see?

110
00:03:33,558 --> 00:03:34,455
Yay!

111
00:03:34,524 --> 00:03:35,353
Whoo!

112
00:03:35,353 --> 00:03:38,079
O-S-U.

113
00:03:38,148 --> 00:03:39,529
[laughter]

114
00:03:39,805 --> 00:03:41,013
Josh has been really supportive

115
00:03:41,117 --> 00:03:43,084
ever since we found out
I was pregnant

116
00:03:43,084 --> 00:03:45,673
and has been trying to
win some money by competing

117
00:03:45,673 --> 00:03:47,019
in more rodeos lately.

118
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:49,988
But since our baby
is coming in a few months,

119
00:03:49,988 --> 00:03:51,645
I want to make
the most of the time

120
00:03:51,645 --> 00:03:52,887
we have together.

121
00:03:55,338 --> 00:03:58,824
If I'’m just, like,
not far along at all?

122
00:04:02,207 --> 00:04:02,828
Okay.

123
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,692
Well, that sucks.

124
00:04:06,176 --> 00:04:07,937
[Mackenzie]
There'’s the merry-go-round.

125
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:08,938
You'’ll not bawl
that hard.

126
00:04:09,007 --> 00:04:10,250
Oh, hell, no.

127
00:04:11,354 --> 00:04:13,632
That thing?
No.

128
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:15,289
You'’re questioning my manhood,
man.

129
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:16,256
[laughs]

130
00:04:16,842 --> 00:04:18,119
[Mackenzie]
I have to give
birth to your kid,

131
00:04:18,119 --> 00:04:20,639
so I think you can
do this for me.

132
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,883
Hey, can she ride?

133
00:04:22,952 --> 00:04:24,264
Yeah, she can ride.

134
00:04:24,747 --> 00:04:25,851
Dang it, man.
You should'’ve helped me out.

135
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,888
You should'’ve said no.

136
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,752
[Mackenzie]
Come on.

137
00:04:29,821 --> 00:04:31,271
Will you help me on it?

138
00:04:32,341 --> 00:04:34,722
[laughs]

139
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,966
Okay, thank you.

140
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:39,969
Oh!

141
00:04:40,452 --> 00:04:41,142
Oh, my gosh.

142
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:42,420
My water just broke.

143
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:43,041
No, it didn'’t.

144
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:43,869
Just kidding.

145
00:04:44,974 --> 00:04:48,771
This is when you put
your arms up and go, "Whoo!"

146
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,875
Are you serious?

147
00:04:55,398 --> 00:04:56,399
Oh.

148
00:04:56,848 --> 00:04:58,298
That'’s a good way
to go into labor.

149
00:05:01,024 --> 00:05:03,786
I hope I'’m with you
when my water breaks.

150
00:05:07,272 --> 00:05:09,516
When'’s my due date, Josh?

151
00:05:09,723 --> 00:05:10,896
It'’s, like...

152
00:05:12,553 --> 00:05:14,624
September 19th.

153
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:16,419
October 9th.

154
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,457
Oh.

155
00:05:21,217 --> 00:05:24,185
You need to get it in gear.

156
00:05:25,014 --> 00:05:26,326
Yeah, I plan on that.

157
00:05:27,465 --> 00:05:28,673
You plan on that?

158
00:05:28,914 --> 00:05:29,674
Yeah.

159
00:05:29,915 --> 00:05:31,331
Okay, well, then,

160
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:34,057
what about your plans
with me in the future?

161
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:40,926
Well, we need to both
settle down and get jobs.

162
00:05:41,271 --> 00:05:42,272
Man, it takes time.

163
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:44,309
I can'’t just go out there
and apply for a job

164
00:05:44,309 --> 00:05:46,691
and expect for
someone to call me back.

165
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:49,245
Okay, but we have to think
about the future.

166
00:05:49,452 --> 00:05:51,212
You can'’t leave me
to do this on my own,

167
00:05:51,281 --> 00:05:55,147
because me, nor my family,
can support this baby.

168
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:58,047
Mine and your money together,
maybe.

169
00:05:58,116 --> 00:06:01,533
But that'’s the only way we'’re
gonna come close to doing it,

170
00:06:01,706 --> 00:06:03,880
is doing it together.

171
00:06:05,295 --> 00:06:07,884
I wish Josh would help me
plan more for the baby.

172
00:06:07,953 --> 00:06:10,646
We know we'’re having a boy,
but that'’s all we know,

173
00:06:10,646 --> 00:06:13,442
and my family is worried
we'’re not ready.

174
00:06:13,718 --> 00:06:16,859
You know, my initial thought

175
00:06:17,066 --> 00:06:20,518
was, "This is my baby sister."

176
00:06:21,001 --> 00:06:22,761
You know, you'’re so young.

177
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:24,453
You'’re only 16.

178
00:06:24,453 --> 00:06:27,904
And for you to take on
a responsibility like this,

179
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:29,389
it worries me.

180
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:33,772
Just don'’t name the baby
something like Cowbell

181
00:06:33,841 --> 00:06:34,566
or something like that.

182
00:06:34,635 --> 00:06:35,981

a lot to figure out

That baby'’s gonna
change everything.

That'’s why I wanted to wring
your neck when I found out

205
00:07:16,746 --> 00:07:18,023

I couldn'’t talk.

and he won'’t
even hardly touch you

212
00:07:27,688 --> 00:07:28,655

and all of a sudden,

213

214

I don'’t know.

215
00:07:31,554 --> 00:07:33,245
I did not want to take
birth control

216
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:35,455
because I did not want
to gain weight.

they were gonna be.

on naming the baby Gannon,

all we have figured out.

Well, clearly, we have no
money to move in together.

If Josh wanted to stay here
and help take care of the baby,

he can just sleep
in the room with the baby,

Two.

359
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:11,238
[Brad]
That'’s the most we'’ve ever made.

360
00:13:11,411 --> 00:13:12,757
So is this gonna be your
career now?

361
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:14,586
Is this what you
gonna do for money?

362
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:15,829
Yep.

363
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:16,899
I'’m gonna make a living
off of this.

364
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:18,176
[laughs]

365
00:13:18,521 --> 00:13:21,352
I just thought we'’d
both have jobs, but...

366
00:13:21,352 --> 00:13:22,180
[Brad]
Yeah.

367
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:23,147
I'’ve tried.

368
00:13:23,837 --> 00:13:25,735
If you get a job right now,
though,

369
00:13:25,735 --> 00:13:27,461
in a month,
you'’re gonna have to take off.

370
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:28,393
[Mackenzie]
I know.

371
00:13:28,669 --> 00:13:30,223
That'’s why no one will hire me.

372
00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:31,258
Yeah.

373
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:33,985
I just don'’t know how
I'’m gonna buy diapers.

374
00:13:34,365 --> 00:13:37,195
Hey, Josh needs to buck up too.

375
00:13:37,195 --> 00:13:38,576
It'’s time to grow up,

376
00:13:38,714 --> 00:13:40,578
'’cause now you got
a baby to think about.

377
00:13:40,578 --> 00:13:42,545
And I think you'’re gonna
be able to survive,

378
00:13:42,545 --> 00:13:44,340
but I think it'’s gonna
be very tough.

379
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,525
So how long you had
this horse, Josh?

380
00:13:56,974 --> 00:13:58,803
I'’ve had him
since he was one.

381
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:00,356
You broke him, didn'’t you?

382
00:14:00,356 --> 00:14:01,633
[Josh]
Yeah.

383
00:14:02,738 --> 00:14:04,533
You gonna ride for a living
when the baby comes?

384
00:14:04,602 --> 00:14:06,397
Yeah, it'’d be nice.

385
00:14:06,638 --> 00:14:09,296
But me and Mackenzie
were talking,

386
00:14:09,296 --> 00:14:12,955
and she'’s on me to give up
rodeo and Bronc riding.

387
00:14:13,024 --> 00:14:13,542
Really?

388
00:14:14,301 --> 00:14:14,992
[Josh]
Yeah, it'’s too dangerous.

389
00:14:15,509 --> 00:14:16,683
What do you think?

390
00:14:16,994 --> 00:14:17,477
[Josh]
I don'’t know.

391
00:14:18,409 --> 00:14:20,135
I mean, like,
I know where she'’s coming from.

392
00:14:20,135 --> 00:14:20,790
She don'’t want me
getting hurt '’cause of Gannon,

393
00:14:22,068 --> 00:14:23,276
but, you know, there'’s
a lot of good Bronc riders

394
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:25,519
that got babies on the way,
or they have babies.

395
00:14:25,588 --> 00:14:28,350
You know, it'’s not affecting how
they worked it out, you know?

396
00:14:28,591 --> 00:14:31,318
But, you know, I'’ve done
this before I met her.

397
00:14:31,387 --> 00:14:32,319
You know?

398
00:14:32,319 --> 00:14:34,183
It'’s part of your life.

399
00:14:34,183 --> 00:14:35,736
[Josh]
Yeah, and I don'’t think
there'’s any way I can just quit.

400
00:14:36,047 --> 00:14:37,221
You know what I mean?

401
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,637
That natural high.
Nothing like it.

402
00:14:39,637 --> 00:14:40,396
[Josh]
Yep.

403
00:14:41,466 --> 00:14:44,607
Well, I'’m not one to get into
anybody'’s business, but...

404
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:48,922
I wouldn'’t do it.

405
00:14:49,612 --> 00:14:50,890
Give up riding?

406
00:14:51,718 --> 00:14:52,961
Nah.

407
00:14:52,961 --> 00:14:54,894
Don'’t take away
somebody'’s rodeo.

408
00:14:57,103 --> 00:14:58,069
[Josh]
Yeah.

409
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,736
[line ringing]

410
00:15:10,668 --> 00:15:12,877
[hooves clomping]

411
00:15:25,579 --> 00:15:27,512
[Mackenzie]
Even though I want
him to stop riding,

412
00:15:27,581 --> 00:15:30,032
Josh has been bringing in
some money from rodeos.

413
00:15:30,101 --> 00:15:31,723
And since I can'’t find a job,

414
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:33,622
and the baby'’s due
in two months,

415
00:15:33,622 --> 00:15:35,210
we don'’t have much choice.

416
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:35,865
Hello?

417
00:15:36,142 --> 00:15:37,729
Hey, what are you doing?

418
00:15:37,798 --> 00:15:39,697
Getting ready to go to a rodeo.

419
00:15:40,042 --> 00:15:41,147
[Mackenzie]
Mm.

420
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:48,223
Be careful.

421
00:15:49,603 --> 00:15:50,328
Love you.

422
00:15:50,466 --> 00:15:51,364
Love you too.

423
00:16:00,407 --> 00:16:02,754
[Mackenzie]
School starts
in a couple of weeks,

424
00:16:02,823 --> 00:16:04,032
so I'’m meeting up
with my friends,

425
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,965
because there'’s
a lot of stuff I need.

426
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,552
Just looking at this
makes me sick.

427
00:16:07,621 --> 00:16:08,657
Yeah, I know.

428
00:16:09,554 --> 00:16:11,625
[Mackenzie]
I only want to take a month off
when Gannon is born

429
00:16:11,694 --> 00:16:13,006
so I don'’t fall too far behind.

430
00:16:13,075 --> 00:16:14,766
Do you need any pencils?

431
00:16:15,629 --> 00:16:17,045
These are $16?

432
00:16:17,114 --> 00:16:19,288
Oh, no, no, no.
We don'’t do that.

433
00:16:19,806 --> 00:16:21,463
Oh, yeah.
20 stuff.

434
00:16:21,463 --> 00:16:22,498
Are those 20?

435
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:24,604
Yeah, that'’s more my...

436
00:16:24,673 --> 00:16:25,777
[both laugh]

437
00:16:26,744 --> 00:16:29,989
[Mackenzie]
This is not how I thought
I would start my junior year.

438
00:16:31,369 --> 00:16:33,164
The summer'’s flown by so fast.

439
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:34,752
I know. I can'’t believe
it'’s almost over.

440
00:16:34,752 --> 00:16:36,167
Like, oh, my gosh.

441
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:37,513
I don'’t even know
what I'’m wearing.

442
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:38,204
Oh, I'’m gonna look hot.

443
00:16:38,859 --> 00:16:39,412
You'’re gonna look
like a rock star.

444
00:16:39,964 --> 00:16:40,482
Mackenzie, what are you wearing?

445
00:16:41,448 --> 00:16:44,003
Um, I'’m gonna look
like a rock star too.

446
00:16:44,072 --> 00:16:45,797
[laughter]

447
00:16:46,212 --> 00:16:49,111
So, Mackenzie,
how are you and Josh doing?

448
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:52,080
Good.

449
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,564
You guys are, like,
the cutest couple ever.

450
00:16:53,633 --> 00:16:55,566
Like, your pictures on
Facebook--

451
00:16:55,566 --> 00:16:57,085
I'’m like, "Oh."

452
00:16:57,361 --> 00:16:59,639
I mean, he can'’t get a job.

453
00:16:59,984 --> 00:17:03,194
Probably '’cause he'’s
on the way to a rodeo.

454
00:17:03,194 --> 00:17:05,058
And I don'’t want to get mad
and be like,

455
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:08,268
"I hate you. You'’re so lazy.
You'’re not getting a job."

456
00:17:08,268 --> 00:17:10,960
But I feel like
this whole situation

457
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:14,274
is very bad timing for getting
ready to have a baby.

458
00:17:15,448 --> 00:17:16,311
Yeah.

459
00:17:25,182 --> 00:17:26,493
[Mackenzie]
Josh and I planned tonight

460
00:17:26,493 --> 00:17:28,495
to look at day care
options together,

461
00:17:29,324 --> 00:17:30,497
but he'’s late.

462
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:41,060
[phone chiming]

463
00:17:41,646 --> 00:17:42,785
Hello?

464
00:17:43,027 --> 00:17:44,097
[Becky]
Hey, Mackenzie?

465
00:17:44,684 --> 00:17:45,478
Hi.

466
00:17:52,657 --> 00:17:55,522
Um, Josh has been
in a car accident?

467
00:18:01,804 --> 00:18:02,633
I'’m at my house.

468
00:18:03,185 --> 00:18:05,463
I will be up there
as soon as I can.

469
00:18:07,465 --> 00:18:08,432
Okay.

470
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,166
[engine turning over]

471
00:18:30,557 --> 00:18:32,352
When I got to the hospital,

472
00:18:32,352 --> 00:18:35,528
Josh was in the ICU for neck
and head injuries.

473
00:18:35,597 --> 00:18:38,841
His family told me his pickup
got hit by a truck.

474
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,637
Although he might need
surgery in a few weeks,

475
00:18:41,706 --> 00:18:44,192
the doctors sent him
home for rest.

476
00:18:50,094 --> 00:18:51,992
I never thought I'’d
have to worry about

477
00:18:51,992 --> 00:18:53,477
you getting hit by a semi.

478
00:18:54,409 --> 00:18:58,861
I thought I'’d have to worry
about you getting bucked off.

479
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:05,282
So you don'’t know 100%
you'’re having surgery?

480
00:19:05,489 --> 00:19:07,629
[Josh]
Well, we'’ll see,
but I don'’t know when.

481
00:19:07,629 --> 00:19:10,873
But hopefully I'’ll be
able to ride again.

482
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:15,499
I say, because you have a son,
you'’re not getting back on one.

483
00:19:16,016 --> 00:19:18,260
Yeah, but there'’s a lot
of Bronc riders,

484
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,779
a lot of bull riders out there,

485
00:19:19,779 --> 00:19:22,368
that are in the same condition
as I am or even worse--

486
00:19:22,437 --> 00:19:24,646
They didn'’t get hit by a semi.

487
00:19:24,715 --> 00:19:26,268
Yeah, no [bleep].

488
00:19:26,268 --> 00:19:28,546
Okay, but do you understand
why I'’m frustrated?

489
00:19:28,615 --> 00:19:32,205
Because I'’m having a baby.
I have no money.

490
00:19:32,205 --> 00:19:33,896
You can'’t work.

491
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:37,728
So pretty much,
day care'’s out of the question.

492
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:39,488
Like, I have to wake up
and go to school.

493
00:19:39,557 --> 00:19:41,525
What are you wanting me
to do with him?

494
00:19:41,835 --> 00:19:43,251
I don'’t know.

495
00:19:43,251 --> 00:19:44,804
I mean, it'’s hard for me
to think right now.

496
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:47,634
I'’m having a baby,
and I have nowhere to put him.

497
00:19:47,703 --> 00:19:49,705
I'’m not dropping
out of high school.

498
00:19:49,843 --> 00:19:52,467
And if that'’s my only choice,
to drop out,

499
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:54,400
then I'’m gonna be mad.

500
00:19:56,298 --> 00:19:58,093
Like, you won'’t say anything.

501
00:19:58,093 --> 00:19:59,543
Because I don'’t know.

502
00:20:00,026 --> 00:20:03,202
You can at least say,
"It'’ll all work out.

503
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,824
"Things will be better."

504
00:20:05,238 --> 00:20:06,688
But you just go, "Okay."

505
00:20:08,034 --> 00:20:10,001
What?

506
00:20:13,626 --> 00:20:15,490
Control my brain, what I do,

507
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:18,286
and if they do something,
it could [bleep] paralyze me.

508
00:20:18,941 --> 00:20:21,323
Okay, you can stop
talking to me like that.

509
00:20:21,392 --> 00:20:23,601
No, you just don'’t get it.
You don'’t.

510
00:20:23,601 --> 00:20:26,880
You think everything'’s gonna
be all right, but it'’s not.

511
00:20:30,194 --> 00:20:32,196
[sighs] Explain

512
00:20:41,861 --> 00:20:43,725
Explain to me
what the doctor said.

513
00:20:43,725 --> 00:20:47,349
I guess he has to have
surgery on his neck.

514
00:20:47,694 --> 00:20:48,971
Oh, my gosh.

515
00:20:49,178 --> 00:20:52,043
But they'’re waiting
and putting it off.

516
00:20:52,665 --> 00:20:53,976
So you'’re afraid--

517
00:20:53,976 --> 00:20:56,703
I'’ll have a newborn
with no help.

518
00:20:56,876 --> 00:20:59,292
Well, that'’s a possibility.

519
00:20:59,361 --> 00:21:04,055
I wanted things to be better
than this when Gannon was born.

520
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,781
But the bottom line is,

521
00:21:05,781 --> 00:21:07,093
there'’s a baby coming
in a few weeks.

522
00:21:07,542 --> 00:21:09,337
Actually, it could be any day.

523
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:10,545
I know.

524
00:21:10,717 --> 00:21:13,686
And we can make the best of it,

525
00:21:13,755 --> 00:21:15,515
or we can make the worst of it.

526
00:21:15,515 --> 00:21:16,965
You know what I'’m saying?

527
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:25,663
[Mackenzie]
There'’s a lot to do
before Gannon comes,

528
00:21:25,663 --> 00:21:26,975
and since money'’s tight,

529
00:21:26,975 --> 00:21:28,701
we'’re setting up
my old baby crib.

530
00:21:28,701 --> 00:21:29,564
See, I'’m smart.

531
00:21:29,564 --> 00:21:30,323
I left the screws in it.

532
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:33,637
[Mackenzie]
And today, my sisters are
throwing us a baby shower

533
00:21:33,637 --> 00:21:35,708
so we can get things
in place for Gannon.

534
00:21:35,777 --> 00:21:38,055
Okay, one, two, three.

535
00:21:39,228 --> 00:21:41,334
[Mackenzie]
It means a lot to me
that Josh made it,

536
00:21:41,403 --> 00:21:43,854
even though he'’s
not feeling great.

537
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:44,993
Oh, my gosh.

538
00:21:44,993 --> 00:21:45,614
Ah!

539
00:21:46,374 --> 00:21:47,340
Look at them.

540
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:48,479
Aren'’t they cute?

541
00:21:48,479 --> 00:21:49,411
[Mackenzie]
Oh, my gosh.

542
00:21:49,584 --> 00:21:50,309
Oh, look at this one.

543
00:21:50,378 --> 00:21:52,207
Ah.

544
00:21:53,242 --> 00:21:53,898
Cute.

545
00:21:53,898 --> 00:21:55,003
Oh, my goodness.

546
00:21:55,072 --> 00:21:55,624
Look.

547
00:21:55,624 --> 00:21:56,211
Ah.

548
00:21:56,384 --> 00:21:57,350
Oh, realtree.

549
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,248
That is adorable.

550
00:21:59,248 --> 00:22:00,319
And it has a hat.

551
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,837
It'’s realtree!

552
00:22:01,837 --> 00:22:04,392
Although I'’m still not sure
who will watch Gannon

553
00:22:04,392 --> 00:22:05,807
when I go back to school,

554
00:22:05,807 --> 00:22:07,636
I'’m glad we got a lot
of what we need,

555
00:22:07,636 --> 00:22:11,330
and our families have offered
to help out as much as they can.

556
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,892
Today is the first day
of my junior year.

557
00:22:21,961 --> 00:22:24,204
[Angie]
Hey, Mackers, wake up.

558
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:26,483
Hello?

559
00:22:26,586 --> 00:22:27,484
You can do this.

560
00:22:28,381 --> 00:22:29,969
[Mackenzie]
I'’m more uncomfortable
than ever,

561
00:22:29,969 --> 00:22:32,109
but since I know I'’ll
have a lot of absences

562
00:22:32,109 --> 00:22:35,595
after Gannon is born,
I can'’t miss any days now.

563
00:22:35,595 --> 00:22:36,976
Oh, goodness.

564
00:22:37,735 --> 00:22:39,185
I can'’t zip it.

565
00:22:44,639 --> 00:22:45,467
[chime dings]

566
00:22:46,157 --> 00:22:47,849
I used to be
the smallest girl in school,

567
00:22:47,849 --> 00:22:50,230
but today,
I can'’t hide from anyone.

568
00:22:50,299 --> 00:22:52,163
I can handle all the whispers,

569
00:22:52,232 --> 00:22:54,649
but going from
class to class all day

570
00:22:54,649 --> 00:22:58,169
has made my feet swell up
so bad, I can barely walk.

571
00:23:01,207 --> 00:23:03,071
Hey.

572
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:04,279
Oh, hi.

573
00:23:04,348 --> 00:23:05,073
You tired?

574
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,834
Yeah.
I need to take these off ASAP.

575
00:23:07,903 --> 00:23:09,388
[laughs]

576
00:23:12,114 --> 00:23:13,840
[Whitney]
So how was school?

577
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,532
Were people nice to you?

578
00:23:15,532 --> 00:23:18,431
They were just like,
"Oh, Mackenzie.

579
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:19,294
"Whoa."

580
00:23:19,363 --> 00:23:20,226
[laughs]

581
00:23:28,199 --> 00:23:30,788
Being back in school is
really wearing me out,

582
00:23:30,788 --> 00:23:33,481
so I'’m not sure I can
keep it up another month

583
00:23:33,481 --> 00:23:34,516
until my due date.

584
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:36,484
[Whitney]
We'’re giving you one week
until you pop.

585
00:23:36,725 --> 00:23:39,418
I'’m gonna pop tonight.

586
00:23:39,694 --> 00:23:40,902
I mean, like...

587
00:23:43,111 --> 00:23:44,871
My whole body'’s swollen.

588
00:23:44,871 --> 00:23:46,735
Even the baby'’s swollen.

589
00:23:47,529 --> 00:23:49,876
[Angie]
Mack, you need to go lay down,
put your feet up.

590
00:23:49,876 --> 00:23:51,291
Yeah.

591
00:23:51,775 --> 00:23:54,018
I feel like I'’m gonna throw up.

592
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:56,573
I need to lay down.

593
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:09,171
Mom!

594
00:24:12,485 --> 00:24:14,591
Hey, kiddo.
What'’s wrong?

595
00:24:14,591 --> 00:24:15,902
My stomach.

596
00:24:16,178 --> 00:24:18,422
Okay, like, is it,
like, your back hurting

597
00:24:18,491 --> 00:24:22,668
because you'’re too big,
or is it contractions?

598
00:24:22,806 --> 00:24:23,738
I don'’t know.

599
00:24:23,807 --> 00:24:25,325
Contractions, I think.

600
00:24:25,325 --> 00:24:27,327
Okay, so do you want
to go to the doctor?

601
00:24:27,396 --> 00:24:29,122
You think
we need to go in?

602
00:24:29,778 --> 00:24:31,021
Yeah.

603
00:24:31,021 --> 00:24:32,505
Okay, get your shoes on.
Did you call Josh?

604
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:33,851
Yeah, I texted him.

605
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,715
[Angie]
Okay.

606
00:24:36,026 --> 00:24:37,337
You don'’t have any bags packed.

607
00:24:37,337 --> 00:24:39,478
They probably won'’t keep me
anyways.

608
00:24:39,547 --> 00:24:40,996
[Angie]
Okay.
Well, we'’ll try.

609
00:24:41,065 --> 00:24:42,411
Come on.

610
00:24:47,831 --> 00:24:49,660
Oh, it hurts.

611
00:24:50,523 --> 00:24:51,490
[moaning]

612
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,976
Yeah.

613
00:24:55,183 --> 00:24:57,185
[engine turning over]

614
00:25:01,465 --> 00:25:02,673
Okay.

615
00:25:06,401 --> 00:25:08,886
Okay, I think I need
to call the hospital

616
00:25:08,886 --> 00:25:10,785
and tell them
we'’re on our way, okay?

617
00:25:10,785 --> 00:25:11,751
[Mackenzie]
Yeah.

618
00:25:22,348 --> 00:25:23,936
So how you feeling,
Mackenzie?

619
00:25:25,213 --> 00:25:26,835
Like crap.

620
00:25:27,422 --> 00:25:28,285
Okay.

621
00:25:29,148 --> 00:25:30,632
[Mackenzie]
Although my water
hasn'’t broken yet,

622
00:25:30,632 --> 00:25:33,117
the doctor confirmed
my labor has started

623
00:25:33,117 --> 00:25:34,705
and admitted me.

624
00:25:35,257 --> 00:25:36,500
Ow.

625
00:25:38,606 --> 00:25:41,712
It keeps getting more pressure.

626
00:25:42,886 --> 00:25:44,266
Ow!

627
00:25:47,062 --> 00:25:48,857
It'’s been seven hours.

628
00:25:49,099 --> 00:25:50,134
I'’m miserable.

629
00:25:50,134 --> 00:25:51,308
[Angie]
Oh.

630
00:25:51,964 --> 00:25:54,449
[Mackenzie]
And the doctor told me
that the baby is so big

631
00:25:54,449 --> 00:25:56,520
that he can'’t
come out naturally,

632
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:58,729
so they decided I should
have a C-section.

633
00:26:03,458 --> 00:26:04,839
I'’m pretty scared,

634
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:07,255
but having everyone here
makes it easier.

635
00:26:07,496 --> 00:26:09,395
[Josh]
Give a thumbs-up.
You'’re a happy daddy.

636
00:26:09,395 --> 00:26:10,154
[Brad]
Don'’t worry about it.

637
00:26:10,223 --> 00:26:11,190
We got it.

638
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:11,846
[Angie]
Okay, thank you.

639
00:26:15,056 --> 00:26:17,058
[Angie]
You'’re gonna have a baby,
Mackey.

640
00:26:17,817 --> 00:26:19,854
Can you believe
it'’s finally here?

641
00:26:22,408 --> 00:26:23,754
You can'’t feel your butt?

642
00:26:23,754 --> 00:26:24,686

[laughs]

643
00:26:24,686 --> 00:26:26,723
That'’s a good thing.

644
00:26:27,102 --> 00:26:28,414
How you doing, Josh?

645
00:26:31,141 --> 00:26:31,935
You feel pressure?

646
00:26:31,935 --> 00:26:32,901
Yeah.

647
00:26:34,178 --> 00:26:35,145
[Angie]
Hang on.

648
00:26:36,249 --> 00:26:37,250
Ow!

649
00:26:37,734 --> 00:26:39,667
[Nurse]
Can you take a deep breath in?

650
00:26:39,736 --> 00:26:40,909
[Angie]
You okay?

651
00:26:45,293 --> 00:26:46,156
[Nurse]
Deep breath in.

652
00:26:46,225 --> 00:26:48,399
Ow!
Ow!

653
00:26:48,468 --> 00:26:49,918
Oh.

Oh, he'’s gorgeous, Mackey!

Right now?

Is he a football player
or a bullrider?

Bullrider.
For sure.

He'’s dandy.

675
00:28:01,749 --> 00:28:02,681
It will get better.

676
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:04,199
You just got to get up

677
00:28:04,199 --> 00:28:06,374
and walk around slow
when you can.

678
00:28:08,548 --> 00:28:10,481
It hurts so bad.

679
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:14,106
I'’m in a lot of pain
and can'’t do much.

680
00:28:14,106 --> 00:28:15,383
But if Josh takes it easy,

681
00:28:15,797 --> 00:28:19,283
his doctor said it was okay
to take his neck brace off.

682
00:28:26,877 --> 00:28:29,708
And after a few days,
I was feeling better,

683
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,640
and it was finally
time to go home.

684
00:28:32,055 --> 00:28:33,056
[Angie]
Uh-oh.

685
00:28:33,988 --> 00:28:35,679
Okay, you ready for this?

686
00:28:35,748 --> 00:28:37,025
Whoo.

687
00:28:37,094 --> 00:28:37,716
Yeah.

688
00:28:38,958 --> 00:28:40,615

Josh is going to stay over
to help with the baby.

689
00:28:40,615 --> 00:28:43,204
And since it'’s gonna take
some time for me to heal,

690
00:28:43,204 --> 00:28:45,758
my mom is taking
this week off from work.

00:28:45,827 --> 00:28:48,450
Yay, Gannon, you'’re home.

692
00:28:48,968 --> 00:28:50,798
Can you get him out of there,
Josh?

Hey!

He needs a bigger one.

00:29:29,664 --> 00:29:32,701
[Mackenzie]
He peed all over
his other onesie.

708
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:33,668
[Angie]
Ah.

709
00:29:34,117 --> 00:29:36,360
Did you pee on your onesie?

710
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:45,059
[laughs]

711
00:29:45,438 --> 00:29:46,508
Good night, guys.

712
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,338
I'’m in the other room
if you need me.

713
00:29:55,966 --> 00:29:59,245
[crickets chirping]

714
00:29:59,556 --> 00:30:01,213
[baby crying]

715
00:30:01,282 --> 00:30:02,973
[Mackenzie]
Gosh.

716
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:14,502
[groans]

717
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,578
Well, I just can'’t
get him to latch on.

718
00:30:30,069 --> 00:30:32,623
[baby crying]

719
00:30:36,765 --> 00:30:37,456
Ugh.

720
00:30:37,766 --> 00:30:39,354
I just fed him.

721
00:30:41,494 --> 00:30:43,013
Shh.

722
00:30:43,842 --> 00:30:45,567
That'’s horrible.

723
00:30:45,982 --> 00:30:47,293
Come smell this.

724
00:30:56,751 --> 00:30:59,029
[baby crying]

725
00:31:07,935 --> 00:31:09,798
and tips on how to take
control, at:

726
00:31:15,770 --> 00:31:18,152
[baby crying]

727
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:21,810
[Mackenzie]
These past few weeks
have been exhausting,

728
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:25,193
especially since my mom
has had to go back to work.

729
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:27,437
What'’s the matter?

730
00:31:28,058 --> 00:31:30,716
Because money is tight,
Josh is at his house today,

731
00:31:30,716 --> 00:31:33,339
figuring out what old rodeo gear
he can sell.

732
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:35,272
Since we can'’t afford day care

733
00:31:35,272 --> 00:31:37,033
when I go back
to school in a few days,

734
00:31:37,102 --> 00:31:40,312
the plan is for Josh to watch
Gannon during the day,

735
00:31:40,312 --> 00:31:41,761
and I'’ll get him at night.

736
00:31:42,314 --> 00:31:44,419
Hey, you want to do
my homework for me?

737
00:31:45,006 --> 00:31:47,526
You want to help me
with my homework?

738
00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:52,669
I'’m going back to school today,

739
00:31:52,669 --> 00:31:55,051
and although Josh
still might need neck surgery,

740
00:31:55,051 --> 00:31:58,433
he'’s feeling better
and is able to watch Gannon.

741
00:32:04,025 --> 00:32:05,993
Mackey, hi.

742
00:32:06,062 --> 00:32:07,132
Hi, I missed you.

743
00:32:07,339 --> 00:32:08,719
I missed you too.

744
00:32:10,687 --> 00:32:13,172
How does it feel
being back at school?

745
00:32:13,655 --> 00:32:17,211
Um, I miss my baby.

746
00:32:17,211 --> 00:32:18,005
Oh.

747
00:32:18,005 --> 00:32:19,144
Where is Gannon?

748
00:32:19,144 --> 00:32:21,008
He'’s at his dad'’s.

749
00:32:22,319 --> 00:32:25,219
You'’re always so busy.
I never get to see you at all.

750
00:32:25,219 --> 00:32:26,530
I know.

751
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,774
We went from
hanging out every day to--

752
00:32:28,774 --> 00:32:29,671
Yeah.

753
00:32:30,465 --> 00:32:32,433
But then again, you didn'’t have
a baby on your side every time.

754
00:32:32,433 --> 00:32:33,710
I know.

755
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:36,437
I have so much making up to do.

756
00:32:36,782 --> 00:32:37,852
[Victoria]
Yeah.

757
00:32:38,542 --> 00:32:41,062
And you don'’t have any time
at home to do homework, huh?

758
00:32:41,062 --> 00:32:41,960
[Mackenzie]
I know.

759
00:32:42,477 --> 00:32:45,687
I'’m learning how to live
on no sleep.

760
00:32:46,378 --> 00:32:48,069
That'’s fun.

761
00:32:48,138 --> 00:32:50,451
No, not really.

762
00:32:50,451 --> 00:32:52,418
Are you ready
for Tumbling Tuesday?

763
00:32:52,418 --> 00:32:53,454
[Victoria]
Yeah.

764
00:32:53,454 --> 00:32:55,249
I'’ll be starting out slow.

765
00:32:55,732 --> 00:32:58,321
Yeah, you'’re on my level now.
Ha-ha.

766
00:32:58,321 --> 00:32:59,632
[laughs]

767
00:33:03,291 --> 00:33:05,155
Oh, okay.

768
00:33:05,397 --> 00:33:07,502
I'’m losing it.

769
00:33:09,021 --> 00:33:09,849
[Angie]
Oh, God.

770
00:33:10,195 --> 00:33:11,023
Bye.

771
00:33:15,924 --> 00:33:17,547
[Mackenzie]
Oh, gosh.

772
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:21,344
I'’m excited to make
a total fool out of myself.

773
00:33:21,344 --> 00:33:22,828
[Victoria]
You are not.

774
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:24,761
And what are you
gonna do with Gannon

775
00:33:24,761 --> 00:33:26,590
while we'’re tumbling?

776
00:33:26,832 --> 00:33:28,765
I don'’t know.
I'’m just gonna sit him there,

777
00:33:28,834 --> 00:33:31,009
and if he cries, I'’ll feed him.

778
00:33:31,526 --> 00:33:32,148
Really?

779
00:33:32,355 --> 00:33:33,390
Ew.

780
00:33:33,459 --> 00:33:34,495
Ew.

781
00:33:34,495 --> 00:33:36,014
Whoo!
What is that?

782
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:38,844
[laughs]

783
00:33:38,844 --> 00:33:40,363
Gannon, did you poop?

784
00:33:41,053 --> 00:33:42,813
[Victoria]
Oh, that was bad.

785
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:44,746
[Mackenzie]
Ready to tumble?

786
00:33:44,815 --> 00:33:46,162
[Victoria]
Oh, yeah.

787
00:33:46,541 --> 00:33:47,715
Whoo!

788
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,650
[Matt]
Much better on the layout.

789
00:33:51,926 --> 00:33:52,444
Hi.

790
00:33:52,444 --> 00:33:53,134
Hey.

791
00:33:53,238 --> 00:33:54,273
How are you?

792
00:33:54,446 --> 00:33:55,274
[Mackenzie]
Good.

793
00:33:55,516 --> 00:33:56,482
Who is this?

794
00:33:56,689 --> 00:33:58,864
He'’s gonna stunt.

795
00:33:58,864 --> 00:34:00,659
He'’s smiling.

796
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:02,626
[Matt]
That'’s a smile?
That'’s not a smile, Mackenzie.

797
00:34:02,626 --> 00:34:03,489
[laughter]

798
00:34:04,111 --> 00:34:05,698
All right, stretch out.
Let'’s get started.

799
00:34:05,767 --> 00:34:07,217
We need to stretch a lot.

800
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:13,327
Oh, my gosh.

801
00:34:13,534 --> 00:34:14,742
[Matt]
This is gonna be rough.

802
00:34:17,745 --> 00:34:18,849
Oh, my.

803
00:34:18,849 --> 00:34:20,265
I bet that one
felt good.

804
00:34:21,162 --> 00:34:23,199
[Mackenzie]
I can'’t do this.

805
00:34:23,647 --> 00:34:24,855
[Matt]
Okay, tossings.

806
00:34:24,855 --> 00:34:27,582
Just if--
If you see blood, stop.

807
00:34:27,582 --> 00:34:28,238
Wait.

808
00:34:28,238 --> 00:34:29,032
Oh, god.

809
00:34:29,584 --> 00:34:30,723
[Matt]
One, two.

810
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:32,656
Ah!

811
00:34:32,656 --> 00:34:33,347
You'’re slow on bottom.

812
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:35,452
Right over my nose.
Okay, you got this.

813
00:34:35,728 --> 00:34:37,109
Give me a good jump.

814
00:34:37,558 --> 00:34:39,146
One, two.

815
00:34:40,526 --> 00:34:41,700

Oh, sorry!Mackey.

816
00:34:41,769 --> 00:34:43,529

I did that.

817
00:34:43,529 --> 00:34:45,013
[Victoria]
It'’s different seeing her
not being able

818
00:34:45,013 --> 00:34:46,360
to just throw
whatever she wanted.

819
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:47,119
Mm-hmm.

820
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,396
We got to hit one.

821
00:34:48,396 --> 00:34:49,087
We do?

822
00:34:49,259 --> 00:34:49,811
[Matt]
Yeah.

823
00:34:49,811 --> 00:34:50,743
Okay.

824
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:54,092
Squeeze tight, okay?
One, two.

825
00:34:55,369 --> 00:34:56,680
Bend your knees.

826
00:34:57,371 --> 00:34:58,026
Ah!

827
00:34:58,026 --> 00:34:59,027
Buck up, Mackey.

828
00:35:00,995 --> 00:35:02,583
[Mackenzie]
Oh, my gosh, Matt.

829
00:35:02,652 --> 00:35:04,481
I just embarrassed myself.

830
00:35:04,481 --> 00:35:05,724
Oh, whatever.

831
00:35:05,724 --> 00:35:07,035
[sighs]

832
00:35:07,035 --> 00:35:08,727
I thought it would be easier,

833
00:35:08,727 --> 00:35:10,349

but that hurt.

834
00:35:10,349 --> 00:35:12,903
Well, I mean, you just got
to take it slow and get back in.

835
00:35:12,903 --> 00:35:14,146
From the sounds of it,

836
00:35:14,146 --> 00:35:15,768
probably ought
to call it a night.

837
00:35:16,631 --> 00:35:19,289
[baby crying]

838
00:35:19,289 --> 00:35:20,704
He'’s mad.

839
00:35:21,429 --> 00:35:23,293
[Matt]
It was kind of a short
practice, wasn'’t it?

840
00:35:23,293 --> 00:35:24,191
Yeah.

841
00:35:31,784 --> 00:35:34,408
It'’s going to be tough
to get back into tumbling,

842
00:35:34,408 --> 00:35:37,549
but I know with Josh'’s injury,
he'’s missing riding too.

843
00:35:37,618 --> 00:35:40,483
So tonight, Josh'’s mom
is babysitting Gannon

844
00:35:40,552 --> 00:35:42,864
so we can all go out
and see the rodeo.

845
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:44,142
Bye.

846
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:45,108
[Mackenzie]
Thanks for watching him.

847
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,561
[Announcer]
All right,
ladies and gentlemen...

848
00:35:52,564 --> 00:35:57,362
[audience cheering]

849
00:35:57,672 --> 00:35:59,053
[Victoria]
Do you miss it?

850
00:36:01,124 --> 00:36:02,677
[Lane]
Does this look
dangerous to you?

851
00:36:02,677 --> 00:36:03,885
[Mackenzie]
Yes.

852
00:36:03,885 --> 00:36:04,334
[Lane]
Yeah, it looks dangerous.

853
00:36:07,303 --> 00:36:08,752
[Lane]
Did you seriously
just say that?

854
00:36:08,821 --> 00:36:09,995
[Victoria]
Where is he going?

855
00:36:09,995 --> 00:36:11,514
He'’ll ask him
to ride a bull.

856
00:36:12,273 --> 00:36:12,722
Man.

857
00:36:13,516 --> 00:36:13,585
You'’re asking
to ride?

858
00:36:14,379 --> 00:36:15,138
I want to ask one, yeah.

859
00:36:15,138 --> 00:36:15,656
Please don'’t.

860
00:36:15,656 --> 00:36:15,725
No way.

861
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:18,452
That'’s not funny.
Tell him, "No."

862
00:36:18,452 --> 00:36:19,107
[Lane]
Come on, man.
You can'’t do this.

863
00:36:20,350 --> 00:36:21,800
[Victoria]
You just got done
with all your...

864
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,215
[Lane]
Yeah,
you ain'’t even released yet.

865
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:24,872
[Victoria]
Semi stuff that happened.

866
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,357
Think about it.

867
00:36:27,771 --> 00:36:28,634
[horn honks]

868
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:30,429
Think about what you'’re
doing right now, Josh.

869
00:36:31,154 --> 00:36:32,328
It ain'’t a good idea.

870
00:36:33,501 --> 00:36:35,296
Yeah, I know.
That'’s your problem.

871
00:36:35,572 --> 00:36:37,678
[Victoria]
Like,
what if something does happen?

872
00:36:37,747 --> 00:36:38,748
[Lane]
Yeah.

873
00:36:39,507 --> 00:36:41,578
Think about you hitting
the ground over there, Josh.

874
00:36:42,234 --> 00:36:43,684
Think about you taking a horn.

875
00:36:44,443 --> 00:36:47,066
Please don'’t do this, Josh.
Please.

876
00:36:47,066 --> 00:36:48,551
Dude, I just think
it'’s pointless

877
00:36:48,551 --> 00:36:51,036
to come all this way,
and nothing [bleep] happen.

878
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,281
[Victoria]
That doesn'’t me you have to,
though.

879
00:36:56,455 --> 00:36:59,147
[bleep].
It'’s not life or death, man.

880
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:02,703
Man, do not get on one tonight.

881
00:37:10,193 --> 00:37:11,401
[Announcer]
Don'’t go away.

882
00:37:11,401 --> 00:37:12,609
This episode
of "16 and Pregnant"

883
00:37:12,609 --> 00:37:14,335
continues right now.

884
00:37:18,891 --> 00:37:21,791
[Mackenzie]
Josh, everyone'’s leaving.

885
00:37:23,827 --> 00:37:25,035
Let'’s just go.

886
00:37:25,519 --> 00:37:26,692
[Josh]
Yeah.

887
00:37:34,217 --> 00:37:37,185
[Mackenzie]
I can'’t believe Josh actually
wanted to ride tonight.

888
00:37:37,496 --> 00:37:41,293
The thought of him getting back
into rodeos despite his injuries

889
00:37:41,362 --> 00:37:45,435
is keeping me up all night
and really making me mad.

890
00:37:56,481 --> 00:37:58,966
[line rings]

891
00:37:59,794 --> 00:38:00,933
[Josh]
Hello?

892
00:38:01,624 --> 00:38:03,729
Are you going to stop, Josh?

893
00:38:06,663 --> 00:38:08,976
Do you think it'’s gonna
make me like you more?

894
00:38:09,045 --> 00:38:10,702
I mean, what--

895
00:38:10,702 --> 00:38:12,876
Do you think it'’s accomplishing
anything, other than hurting me?

896
00:38:13,221 --> 00:38:16,224
I just want you to grow up,
and I just want you to stop,

897
00:38:16,224 --> 00:38:17,433
and you won'’t.

898
00:38:17,709 --> 00:38:20,125
And you won'’t,
and it'’s gonna ruin us.

899
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:24,371
Seriously?

900
00:38:30,515 --> 00:38:32,102
I'’ll be at your house soon.

901
00:38:43,942 --> 00:38:48,740
How about you sacrifice riding
and rodeos for me and Gannon?

902
00:38:52,606 --> 00:38:53,779
What?

903
00:39:00,027 --> 00:39:01,960
It might not work out, Josh.

904
00:39:04,756 --> 00:39:07,137
If your plan is to stay with me,

905
00:39:08,035 --> 00:39:09,761
you can'’t ride anymore.

906
00:39:11,832 --> 00:39:13,040
What'’s your plan?

907
00:39:13,868 --> 00:39:15,560
Are you gonna quit?

908
00:39:18,079 --> 00:39:19,080
Yeah.

909
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:23,188
[Josh]
It'’s gonna be hard,
but I know Gannon comes first.

910
00:39:28,849 --> 00:39:30,885
After all his concussions,

911
00:39:30,954 --> 00:39:33,854
I would think he would realize
that he needs to stop

912
00:39:33,854 --> 00:39:35,683
bull riding for the baby.

913
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,135
If someone would have told me
when I was little,

914
00:39:39,135 --> 00:39:41,309
"You'’re gonna be with a cowboy,

915
00:39:41,309 --> 00:39:44,830
"and you'’re gonna have
a baby with him at 16,"

916
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:47,246
I would have been like,
"No, no, I'’m not.

917
00:39:47,246 --> 00:39:48,800
"I'’m gonna have fun
the rest of my life.

918
00:39:49,456 --> 00:39:51,354
"I'’m gonna cheer and be crazy
and hang out with my friends.

919
00:39:51,354 --> 00:39:52,666
"That'’s not gonna happen."

920
00:39:53,494 --> 00:39:55,220
Mm, that was gross.

921
00:39:55,462 --> 00:39:57,291
[laughter]

922
00:39:57,774 --> 00:40:00,087
But now that I have a baby,

923
00:40:00,156 --> 00:40:03,331
I don'’t really get
much girl time anymore,

924
00:40:03,331 --> 00:40:06,334
because my life revolves
around the baby.

925
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:08,820
It'’s been tough,

926
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:12,479
but his mom and my mom
have been great to us,

927
00:40:13,169 --> 00:40:15,343
so we'’ve both been really,
really lucky.

928
00:40:15,758 --> 00:40:17,518
[Brad]
Put some clothes
on that boy.

929
00:40:17,518 --> 00:40:19,451
[Mackenzie]
We'’re getting ready
to give him a bath.

930
00:40:19,451 --> 00:40:21,073
I don'’t know what me and Josh
would have done by ourselves.

931
00:40:21,073 --> 00:40:23,282
You know, we would still like
to have a baby

932
00:40:23,282 --> 00:40:25,561
and still be able
to do our dreams.

933
00:40:25,561 --> 00:40:26,216

[Brad]
Oh, cool.

934
00:40:26,527 --> 00:40:27,114
[Angie]
Whoa.

935
00:40:28,149 --> 00:40:28,978
You think you'’re gonna
be able to do that again?

936
00:40:28,978 --> 00:40:30,738
That was so cool.

937
00:40:30,738 --> 00:40:34,466
But we'’re kind of realizing
that we can'’t just run off,

938
00:40:34,535 --> 00:40:38,366
'’cause we are a family,
and family does come first.

939
00:40:38,988 --> 00:40:42,370
So you gonna watch him
while I tumble?

940
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:44,752
[Josh]
Yeah, that'’s fine.

941
00:40:45,304 --> 00:40:46,236
You better be safe.

942
00:40:49,205 --> 00:40:51,138
I don'’t want you
to break your neck.

943
00:40:51,690 --> 00:40:52,415
[sighs]

944
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:53,830
[laughs]

945
00:40:57,489 --> 00:40:58,283
[chime dings]
