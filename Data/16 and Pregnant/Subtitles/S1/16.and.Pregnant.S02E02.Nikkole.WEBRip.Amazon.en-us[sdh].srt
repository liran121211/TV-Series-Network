1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:04,970
- I can't even see what
I'm doing.

2
00:00:05,074 --> 00:00:05,971
This thing's too big.

3
00:00:06,075 --> 00:00:07,628
[gasps]
Hi, I'm Nikkole.

4
00:00:07,731 --> 00:00:10,769
I'm 15, and I'm from Monroe,
Michigan, smack in between

5
00:00:10,872 --> 00:00:13,323
Detroit, Motor City, and
Toledo, Ohio.

6
00:00:13,427 --> 00:00:16,464
My parents are separated, and my
dad is out of the picture.

7
00:00:16,568 --> 00:00:18,466
So I live at home with my mom
and my 12-year-old

8
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:20,054
brother, Brett.

9
00:00:20,158 --> 00:00:21,745
You have to get up and take
a shower.

10
00:00:21,849 --> 00:00:23,264
Mom just told me to tell
you that.

11
00:00:23,368 --> 00:00:25,301
Even though I'm not the kind of
girl who likes being in the

12
00:00:25,404 --> 00:00:27,544
spotlight, I'm definitely
a princess.

13
00:00:27,648 --> 00:00:28,718
I'd wear this one.

14
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:31,583
And my mom spoils me
every chance she gets.

15
00:00:31,686 --> 00:00:33,309
- Your total is $72.38.

16
00:00:33,412 --> 00:00:35,656
- This year, I'm going to be
a junior in high school, and I'm

17
00:00:35,759 --> 00:00:37,209
on the cheerleading squad.

18
00:00:37,313 --> 00:00:39,798
My posse of girls and I are
definite pranksters.

19
00:00:39,901 --> 00:00:41,662
As soon as you get your light
back, I'm shooting you.

20
00:00:41,765 --> 00:00:44,285
One of our favorite pastimes
is TP-ing houses.

21
00:00:44,389 --> 00:00:46,563
- Holy crap.
- I got it.

22
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:48,945
- I guess you could say my life
is pretty charmed, but my luck

23
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,051
is about to change, because...

24
00:00:51,154 --> 00:00:58,920
I'm pregnant.

25
00:00:59,024 --> 00:01:01,164
Everything started when I
met Josh.

26
00:01:01,268 --> 00:01:02,579
I was love-struck.

27
00:01:02,683 --> 00:01:05,686
But our relationship turned
rocky pretty quickly.

28
00:01:05,789 --> 00:01:07,929
One day he would be sweet and
nice, and the next day he would

29
00:01:08,033 --> 00:01:09,310
break it off.

30
00:01:09,414 --> 00:01:12,382
- When did you first start
having sex with Josh?

31
00:01:12,486 --> 00:01:14,281
- When we were dating for,
like, six months.

32
00:01:14,384 --> 00:01:16,110
- Did you guys, like, ever
use condoms?

33
00:01:16,214 --> 00:01:17,111
- We never used them.

34
00:01:17,215 --> 00:01:18,319
- That's crazy.

35
00:01:18,423 --> 00:01:20,252
- He said he was gonna
"pull out."

36
00:01:20,356 --> 00:01:23,600
not surprisingly, with
no protection, I got pregnant.

37
00:01:23,704 --> 00:01:25,982
And when I told Josh I was
keeping the baby,

38
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,328
he broke up with me.

39
00:01:30,607 --> 00:01:33,300
Josh and I haven't really been
talking, and he even started

40
00:01:33,403 --> 00:01:35,164
dating this girl Kyla.

41
00:01:35,267 --> 00:01:37,407
But I'm hoping this break is
just temporary like our

42
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:38,650
other ones.

43
00:01:38,753 --> 00:01:41,135
- Do you want to be with him?
- Yeah.

44
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:43,827
- He cheats all the time.
- No, he doesn't.

45
00:01:43,931 --> 00:01:44,932
- Yeah, he does.

46
00:01:45,035 --> 00:01:46,175
- He's never actually cheated
on me.

47
00:01:46,278 --> 00:01:47,383
- Yeah, he has.

48
00:01:47,486 --> 00:01:49,074
- That's when we were broken
up, remember?

49
00:01:49,178 --> 00:01:51,249
- But you guys break up, like,
every other day.

50
00:01:51,352 --> 00:01:53,596
- He breaks up with you
to cheat on you.

51
00:01:53,699 --> 00:01:55,736
What happened when you told him
that you were pregnant?

52
00:01:55,839 --> 00:01:58,083
- He said that, "You have to
get an abortion, or else I won't

53
00:01:58,187 --> 00:01:59,326
be with you."

54
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:01,362
- Why do you keep calling
him, though?

55
00:02:01,466 --> 00:02:02,777
- Because I love him.

56
00:02:02,881 --> 00:02:05,780
- I know, but you have to be
stronger than that.

57
00:02:05,884 --> 00:02:08,197
- Yeah, but you can't just let
somebody that you're about to

58
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:10,509
have a kid with just walk out of
your life.

59
00:02:10,613 --> 00:02:13,029
- What did your mom even say
whenever you told her?

60
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:15,514
- She cried,
and she yelled at me.

61
00:02:15,618 --> 00:02:17,620
And she kicked me out for a day.

62
00:02:17,723 --> 00:02:20,623
My mom is trying to come to
terms with everything.

63
00:02:20,726 --> 00:02:22,211
- The baby's head is down
over here.

64
00:02:22,314 --> 00:02:24,247
- But I know it's hard for her,
especially because she's never

65
00:02:24,351 --> 00:02:25,800
liked Josh.

66
00:02:25,904 --> 00:02:28,596
And now it's even more real,
because I found out I'm having

67
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,598
a boy, and I'm naming him Lyle.

68
00:02:30,702 --> 00:02:32,635
- These are really nice,
Nikkole.

69
00:02:32,738 --> 00:02:33,498
- I know.

70
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:35,776
- It almost looks real.

71
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,571
- It is real.

72
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:40,608
- Was there anything you're
scared of?

73
00:02:40,712 --> 00:02:42,955
- The only thing I'm
really scared of is that Josh

74
00:02:43,059 --> 00:02:44,819
won't be there.

75
00:02:44,923 --> 00:02:49,514
- I thought when you and Josh
were dating that I was

76
00:02:49,617 --> 00:02:54,139
doing the right thing
as a parent to protect you from

77
00:02:54,243 --> 00:02:55,796
getting pregnant.

78
00:02:55,899 --> 00:03:00,283
At first, I was angry,
'cause I didn't know what to do.

79
00:03:00,387 --> 00:03:01,836
I felt embarrassed.

80
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,011
People see you.

81
00:03:04,114 --> 00:03:06,393
The first thing they do is look
at your belly, and they probably

82
00:03:06,496 --> 00:03:07,842
think, "That poor girl."

83
00:03:07,946 --> 00:03:11,363
and then they look at the mom,
and they say, "How'd you let

84
00:03:11,467 --> 00:03:15,125
that happen?"

85
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:16,437
- Sorry.

86
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:19,509
- 'cause I thought I did all
the right things.

87
00:03:19,613 --> 00:03:22,961
And I felt betrayed by you.

88
00:03:28,035 --> 00:03:31,487
But now that it's here,
I'm gonna hold your hand, and

89
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:34,317
I'm gonna walk you through this.

90
00:03:34,421 --> 00:03:36,423
And we're gonna deal with it
as a family.

91
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,534
- My mom isn't totally over it,
but I'm glad she's ready

92
00:03:44,638 --> 00:03:46,329
to support me now.

93
00:03:46,433 --> 00:03:48,952
I just wish Josh was too.

94
00:03:49,056 --> 00:03:51,852
[alarm blaring]

95
00:03:51,955 --> 00:03:54,026
Today is the first day
of junior year.

96
00:03:54,130 --> 00:03:56,477
I've kind of been dreading it,
because it's the first time

97
00:03:56,581 --> 00:03:58,790
everyone will see
my pregnant belly.

98
00:04:01,517 --> 00:04:02,828
- What are you wearing
those for?

99
00:04:06,694 --> 00:04:08,731
- Not on the first day of
school, Nikkole.

100
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:11,665
Usually it's a fairly
dressed-up day.

101
00:04:11,768 --> 00:04:13,253
- You think people are gonna
stare at you?

102
00:04:13,356 --> 00:04:14,909
- Probably.

103
00:04:17,843 --> 00:04:19,604
- Yeah.
- [horn honks]

104
00:04:19,707 --> 00:04:21,744
- Frankie's here.

105
00:04:21,847 --> 00:04:23,159
I love you. Good luck.

106
00:04:23,263 --> 00:04:24,160
- Thank you.

107
00:04:31,029 --> 00:04:33,203
[engine revving]

108
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:36,828
- I know.

109
00:04:49,427 --> 00:04:52,153
- Yeah.

110
00:04:52,257 --> 00:04:54,673
- Even though there were
definite stares and whispers,

111
00:04:54,777 --> 00:04:58,159
my girls had my back,
and the first day wasn't so bad.

112
00:04:58,263 --> 00:05:00,714
And because Josh is always
getting in trouble, he got

113
00:05:00,817 --> 00:05:03,061
expelled, and I don't see him
at school.

114
00:05:03,164 --> 00:05:05,684
But when I got out, he was
waiting in the parking lot, and

115
00:05:05,788 --> 00:05:07,272
wanted to talk.

116
00:05:08,963 --> 00:05:11,172
- So what's up?
How was your day?

117
00:05:11,276 --> 00:05:12,933
- Great.
- Really?

118
00:05:14,762 --> 00:05:16,454
- So do you think you've
changed now?

119
00:05:16,557 --> 00:05:20,285
- I am sorry for treating you
the way I treated you.

120
00:05:20,389 --> 00:05:23,909
I did do a lot of stupid things
because I really didn't know how

121
00:05:24,013 --> 00:05:25,394
to react.

122
00:05:25,497 --> 00:05:28,224
I felt like it was still my time
to be a teenager and still do

123
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,467
all that stupid [bleep].

124
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,955
- I knew you'd come around
eventually.

125
00:05:35,058 --> 00:05:37,475
- All's I can do is try and
make things right now.

126
00:05:37,578 --> 00:05:39,097
- Are you still talking
to Kyla?

127
00:05:41,651 --> 00:05:44,792
- Well, what do you think's
gonna happen with us?

128
00:05:44,896 --> 00:05:47,381
- I think that there is
definitely still something

129
00:05:47,485 --> 00:05:49,452
between us.

130
00:05:49,556 --> 00:05:53,214
I think that...
I'd love to be with you again.

131
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:56,839
I really would.
I miss you a lot.

132
00:05:57,943 --> 00:05:59,359
- I miss you too.

133
00:05:59,462 --> 00:06:01,740
- I just want you to know that
I still love you.

134
00:06:01,844 --> 00:06:03,190
- I love you too.

135
00:06:06,331 --> 00:06:09,369
Josh and I are back
together again.

136
00:06:15,651 --> 00:06:18,412
- I'm really excited Josh and I
are back together, but I'm not

137
00:06:18,516 --> 00:06:20,932
sure my mom and friends will
feel the same way.

138
00:06:21,035 --> 00:06:22,796
- Hi.
- Hey, Becca.

139
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:23,866
How are ya?

140
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:24,970
- I'm good.

141
00:06:25,074 --> 00:06:27,248
So what happened
yesterday, Nikkole?

142
00:06:27,352 --> 00:06:31,563
- Me and Josh were talking, and
he asked if I would give him

143
00:06:31,667 --> 00:06:33,427
another chance.

144
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:34,842
And I said yes.

145
00:06:34,946 --> 00:06:37,673
- [groans]
- [laughs]

146
00:06:37,776 --> 00:06:38,950
- And why?

147
00:06:39,053 --> 00:06:41,849
- He apologized to me, and he
teared up.

148
00:06:41,953 --> 00:06:43,195
He teared up.

149
00:06:43,299 --> 00:06:45,922
- How do you feel about
Josh, Becca?

150
00:06:46,026 --> 00:06:47,407
- I don't like Josh, honestly.

151
00:06:47,510 --> 00:06:49,512
Like, he sits there and talks to
other girls, but then he tells

152
00:06:49,616 --> 00:06:52,446
Nikkole, "Oh, I love you,"
and stuff like that.

153
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,966
- Did you hear Josh was dating
that girl, or do you know

154
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:56,554
for sure?

155
00:06:56,657 --> 00:06:59,280
- He said he was, but now
they're broken up.

156
00:06:59,384 --> 00:07:00,972
- I don't want to see you get
hurt again, Nikkole.

157
00:07:01,075 --> 00:07:02,836
- I know.

158
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:05,977
- I think after you became
pregnant and he left you, you

159
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:09,670
cried for...two months straight.

160
00:07:09,774 --> 00:07:10,602
- Yeah.

161
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:19,266
- I'm disappointed that you're
not giving it more time.

162
00:07:22,372 --> 00:07:24,616
- It's true Josh has a pattern
of hurting me.

163
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,963
But we're having a baby,
so I have to have faith

164
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:28,275
he can change.

165
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,213
- Are you ready to take the
responsibilities of being

166
00:07:35,316 --> 00:07:36,248
a father?

167
00:07:36,352 --> 00:07:37,284
- I'm not ready for the baby.

168
00:07:37,387 --> 00:07:38,630
I was never ready for the baby.

169
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:40,839
I'm still not ready
for the baby.

170
00:07:40,943 --> 00:07:41,840
- You better get ready.

171
00:07:49,227 --> 00:07:51,816
- Because you put yourself in
those shoes to where, you know,

172
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:55,613
you're not supposed to have
a child at 16 or 17.

173
00:07:55,716 --> 00:08:00,514
You need to not only be there
physically but mentally,

174
00:08:00,618 --> 00:08:02,585
not only for him,
but for Nikkole.

175
00:08:06,624 --> 00:08:09,558
♪

176
00:08:15,598 --> 00:08:18,843
- I don't even know how you
think this is gonna work.

177
00:08:18,946 --> 00:08:20,603
- Well, 'cause I think he's
different now.

178
00:08:20,707 --> 00:08:23,399
He seems like he's coming
around finally.

179
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:24,469
He's trying to get a job.

180
00:08:24,573 --> 00:08:26,713
He's trying to get back
into school.

181
00:08:26,816 --> 00:08:30,026
- Every single time you guys
break up, you say,

182
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,650
"Oh, he's different now,"
and then he goes back.

183
00:08:32,753 --> 00:08:34,893
- I think you just want to
believe in your head that Josh

184
00:08:34,997 --> 00:08:36,274
is gonna change.

185
00:08:36,377 --> 00:08:37,724
But he's really not.

186
00:08:37,827 --> 00:08:40,243
And you see something, like,
totally different than we do.

187
00:08:40,347 --> 00:08:42,280
- Yeah, but you guys don't see
him all the time like I do.

188
00:08:42,383 --> 00:08:44,696
- But I just think you need to
be careful, because we're

189
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,250
looking out for you, and your
mom's looking out for you.

190
00:08:47,354 --> 00:08:50,046
And I don't want to see
you hurt.

191
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:51,013
- Yeah.

192
00:08:55,086 --> 00:08:57,985
Even though everyone has
reservations about Josh, he's

193
00:08:58,089 --> 00:09:00,470
making a real effort in
stepping up.

194
00:09:00,574 --> 00:09:02,231
- Are you happy we're having
a boy?

195
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:05,510
- I always wanted to have a boy
first so that whatever I had

196
00:09:05,614 --> 00:09:07,650
after that, you know, he'd have
an older brother.

197
00:09:07,754 --> 00:09:09,825
I'm happy.
- Me too.

198
00:09:11,827 --> 00:09:13,932
- Me too.

199
00:09:14,036 --> 00:09:15,831
[laughter]

200
00:09:15,934 --> 00:09:17,211
- So what are your plans, Josh?

201
00:09:17,315 --> 00:09:19,800
- I'm planning on getting a job
around Toledo.

202
00:09:19,904 --> 00:09:21,906
Like, even if I make minimum
wage or something, that's still,

203
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:23,424
like, income.

204
00:09:23,528 --> 00:09:25,426
- What are your plans, Nikkole?

205
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:28,119
- Finish high school and then
I want to go

206
00:09:28,222 --> 00:09:29,430
to the University of Toledo.

207
00:09:29,534 --> 00:09:30,984
- That's good.

208
00:09:31,087 --> 00:09:34,746
Josh, I know in the past that
you've done some very negative

209
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,163
things, and I would like to
know if you are ready to step up

210
00:09:38,267 --> 00:09:39,717
and be a parent.

211
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,995
- It took me a while to come
around, but I think I can do

212
00:09:42,098 --> 00:09:43,134
it now.

213
00:09:43,237 --> 00:09:45,205
- Nikkole needs all the help
she can get.

214
00:09:45,308 --> 00:09:48,173
- My mom is trying to accept
him, but I know she still has

215
00:09:48,277 --> 00:09:49,312
her doubts.

216
00:09:53,454 --> 00:09:55,802
I had to skip class because I
have a doctor's appointment,

217
00:09:55,905 --> 00:09:57,942
and Josh agreed to come along.

218
00:10:04,914 --> 00:10:06,813
- Stop playing with the UV
light and stop pushing it--

219
00:10:06,916 --> 00:10:08,573
- Nikkole, really,
stop playing with that.

220
00:10:08,677 --> 00:10:10,368
- I wasn't doing anything, I was
just moving it--

221
00:10:10,471 --> 00:10:13,026
- Yeah, really? Really, really,
is that how you feel?

222
00:10:19,757 --> 00:10:21,172
- [knocking at door]
Hi.

223
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:22,552
- Howdy.
- How you doing?

224
00:10:22,656 --> 00:10:24,002
- Good. I don't want to do this.

225
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:25,659
- You don't want to do this?
- No.

226
00:10:25,763 --> 00:10:26,626
- It's not bad.

227
00:10:26,729 --> 00:10:27,972
Let's see how the baby is doing.

228
00:10:28,075 --> 00:10:29,870
All right, if you don't mind.

229
00:10:29,974 --> 00:10:32,183
- [laughs]
Give me your hand.

230
00:10:32,286 --> 00:10:33,356
- Just relax.

231
00:10:37,188 --> 00:10:41,364
- Hold her hand, buddy.
- 'Cause you're tripping out.

232
00:10:41,468 --> 00:10:43,815
- Okay, well, the baby is low.

233
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:46,093
The baby is definitely
head down.

234
00:10:46,197 --> 00:10:47,819
- I'm not dilating, am I?
- No.

235
00:10:47,923 --> 00:10:49,614
- Okay, good.
- Let's get you up.

236
00:10:49,718 --> 00:10:50,788
Can I give you a hand?

237
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:52,272
So we're really looking very,
very well.

238
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,412
Any contractions or anything
like that?

239
00:10:54,515 --> 00:10:56,483
- Not that I know of.
- Good.

240
00:10:56,586 --> 00:10:57,898
All right, I'll see you
in a week.

241
00:10:58,002 --> 00:11:00,073
- All right, thank you.
Appreciate it.

242
00:11:00,176 --> 00:11:02,385
- I'm glad Josh is here,
but I'm worried his immature

243
00:11:02,489 --> 00:11:04,767
attitude is coming back.

244
00:11:04,871 --> 00:11:07,287
- [crying]

245
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:16,676
- After my doctor's appointment,
I went to hang out with my

246
00:11:16,779 --> 00:11:19,748
friends before they took off for
our school's big game.

247
00:11:19,851 --> 00:11:21,681
[knocking at door]
[laughs]

248
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,307
Hi.
- Hey, Preggo.

249
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,480
- Hi.

250
00:11:28,584 --> 00:11:31,311
- Oh, that was my seat.
Scoot over.

251
00:11:31,414 --> 00:11:32,208
- She don't want to sit by you.

252
00:11:32,312 --> 00:11:34,866
She sat next to me for a reason.

253
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:36,765
- You missed fourth hour.
- What happened?

254
00:11:36,868 --> 00:11:38,007
- We had a sub.

255
00:11:38,111 --> 00:11:40,216
Are you going to the game?
- No.

256
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,355
- Why?

257
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:42,598
- Because I don't want to go.

258
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,257
[phone ringing]
Hello?

259
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,293
- Where you at?
- Becca's.

260
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,091
- Tell him no.

261
00:11:53,195 --> 00:11:55,162
- Shut up, Sam.

262
00:11:55,266 --> 00:11:59,235
I-I-I don't know. I might, okay?

263
00:12:00,858 --> 00:12:01,755
- Josh.

264
00:12:01,859 --> 00:12:04,206
- He's not coming to my house.

265
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:10,799
- What?

266
00:12:14,285 --> 00:12:15,113
- [bleep] you, Josh.

267
00:12:15,217 --> 00:12:16,666
- Stop, Becca.

268
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:18,496
- No, he just called me
a bitch, Nikkole.

269
00:12:18,599 --> 00:12:19,428
- Okay.

270
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:21,188
- Okay, Josh is a [bleep]
ass -- .

271
00:12:21,292 --> 00:12:23,087
- So does that mean you have to
go to the game?

272
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:25,434
- I guess. I don't know.

273
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:28,195
[phone ringing]
- Just tell him, be like, "I'm

274
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:30,163
with my friends right now.
I'll talk to you later."

275
00:12:30,266 --> 00:12:33,649
- I'll answer it.
- Becca, stop.

276
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,133
Okay, Josh.

277
00:12:35,237 --> 00:12:36,617
- [bleep] stupid.

278
00:12:36,721 --> 00:12:38,550
- Okay, bye.

279
00:12:38,654 --> 00:12:40,621
- Have you ever noticed, every
time you're with Josh, you do

280
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:42,692
exactly what he says, and you're
like his little puppy dog?

281
00:12:42,796 --> 00:12:44,004
And it's really annoying.

282
00:12:44,108 --> 00:12:45,419
It's because of Josh.

283
00:12:45,523 --> 00:12:46,731
You don't want to go and hang
out with your friends.

284
00:12:46,835 --> 00:12:48,491
You want to go because Josh
is going.

285
00:12:48,595 --> 00:12:51,287
And that's all you care about
now is Josh.

286
00:12:51,391 --> 00:12:52,530
And it's really
[bleep] annoying.

287
00:12:52,633 --> 00:12:54,256
He had no reason to call me
a bitch.

288
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:56,706
Do I ever say anything rude
to him? No, I don't.

289
00:13:13,862 --> 00:13:16,623
It's been two weeks, and
homecoming is around the corner.

290
00:13:16,726 --> 00:13:19,833
But because Josh got expelled,
he can't come to the dance.

291
00:13:19,937 --> 00:13:22,491
But I'm hoping he'll help me
pick out a dress.

292
00:13:22,594 --> 00:13:24,493
- Well, I'm going outside,
'cause I don't feel like

293
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:26,150
dress shopping.
- Okay.

294
00:13:26,253 --> 00:13:27,427
- Bye, Josh.

295
00:13:31,707 --> 00:13:33,674
- This one would be a cute
one, huh?

296
00:13:36,885 --> 00:13:37,851
No?

297
00:13:37,955 --> 00:13:40,060
It might look cute on.
You could try it.

298
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,617
- Mom?
- Yes?

299
00:13:46,687 --> 00:13:49,345
- Nikkole, get out, Nikkole.
- It feels like it would fit.

300
00:13:49,449 --> 00:13:50,450
- It feels like it would fit.

301
00:13:50,553 --> 00:13:52,038
I'm thinking the zipper was
just bad.

302
00:13:52,141 --> 00:13:53,349
- Get out.
- I can't.

303
00:13:53,453 --> 00:13:55,351
- That one's great.
Put that one on.

304
00:13:55,455 --> 00:13:57,353
That's the one you're gonna get.
It's beautiful.

305
00:13:57,457 --> 00:13:59,390
- Want to see, Josh?
- No.

306
00:13:59,493 --> 00:14:01,495
I just want her to get it.
It's beautiful.

307
00:14:01,599 --> 00:14:03,532
Get it. Just get it.
Yes, it's fine.

308
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,465
- I popped the zipper.

309
00:14:05,568 --> 00:14:07,398
- Get another one with a
regular zipper and just go get

310
00:14:07,501 --> 00:14:09,849
it, and then purchase it and
take me home.

311
00:14:19,341 --> 00:14:20,514
- Don't get depressed, Nikkole.

312
00:14:20,618 --> 00:14:22,827
It's all a part about
being pregnant.

313
00:14:22,931 --> 00:14:25,105
Things don't fit the same way
they used to.

314
00:14:28,315 --> 00:14:30,593
It'll be okay, Nikkole.

315
00:14:30,697 --> 00:14:33,355
- I used to be a size 0,
and now I barely fit into

316
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:34,666
a size 10.

317
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:37,393
To make matters worse,
Josh is being a jerk.

318
00:14:37,497 --> 00:14:41,742
- Thank you.
- Appreciate it.

319
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:45,815
- Because.
- Because?

320
00:14:45,919 --> 00:14:47,196
- Why not?

321
00:14:47,300 --> 00:14:49,612
- I guess the big reason that I
don't want you to go to

322
00:14:49,716 --> 00:14:51,304
homecoming is that I can't
even go.

323
00:14:51,407 --> 00:14:53,237
It's supposed to be like
a boyfriend-girlfriend thing.

324
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:55,101
You want to go with your
friends, it's cool, I guess.

325
00:14:55,204 --> 00:14:57,448
- I'm probably only gonna
stay for, like, an hour.

326
00:14:57,551 --> 00:14:59,139
- 15 minutes?
- Josh.

327
00:14:59,243 --> 00:15:00,934
- I'll be in the parking lot.
- No, you won't.

328
00:15:01,038 --> 00:15:02,487
- Yes, I will.
- I doubt it.

329
00:15:02,591 --> 00:15:04,420
- I will.
- Okay.

330
00:15:04,524 --> 00:15:06,284
- So after an hour, we're gonna
hang out?

331
00:15:06,388 --> 00:15:08,010
- Yeah.

332
00:15:08,114 --> 00:15:09,909
- So it looks like I'm going to
spend at least part of

333
00:15:10,012 --> 00:15:12,049
homecoming night with Josh.

334
00:15:17,226 --> 00:15:19,815
- The homecoming dance is
tonight, and I'm excited,

335
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,162
because I get to spend the first
part with friends and the second

336
00:15:22,266 --> 00:15:23,405
part with Josh.

337
00:15:23,508 --> 00:15:25,994
- So what did Josh have to say?

338
00:15:26,097 --> 00:15:29,480
He's upset that he can't go to
the dance with me.

339
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:33,035
- Are you gonna meet up with
him afterwards, or--

340
00:15:33,139 --> 00:15:34,554
- Mm-hmm.

00:24:49,453 --> 00:24:50,696
- I need a ride home.

515
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:52,870
- Well, Courtney's coming.
- All right.

516
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:57,634
- I'm trying to share space
here, Josh.

517
00:24:57,737 --> 00:24:59,152
- Don't talk to me.

518
00:24:59,256 --> 00:25:01,189
- Joshua.
- Do not talk to me.

519
00:25:01,292 --> 00:25:02,466
- I told you earlier about
being disrespectful--

520
00:25:12,234 --> 00:25:13,477
- You're an ass.

521
00:25:13,581 --> 00:25:15,583
- She had her little snap.
I get my little snap, Mom.

522
00:25:15,686 --> 00:25:18,413
- Bottom line, she's the thing
that's important here.

523
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:21,071
And you know what?
You need to suck it up.

524
00:25:21,174 --> 00:25:22,210
That's still her mom, Joshua.

525
00:25:22,313 --> 00:25:23,936
- I'm trying to tell you to
calm it down.

526
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:25,662
- I don't want you to tell
me anything.

527
00:25:25,765 --> 00:25:27,180
I don't want you to tell
me anything.

528
00:25:27,284 --> 00:25:29,597
- I'm gonna tell you, Josh.
- I know.

529
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:30,908
And that's why I'm telling you
I'm sick and tired of

530
00:25:31,012 --> 00:25:32,669
hearing it.
And you won't give up.

531
00:25:32,772 --> 00:25:34,084
- Joshua.

532
00:25:34,187 --> 00:25:35,603
- So when I say, "Please stop
saying this,"--

533
00:25:35,706 --> 00:25:36,811
- It's my daughter, Josh.

534
00:25:36,914 --> 00:25:38,433
It may be your baby,
but this is my daughter.

535
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:40,021
I trump you.

536
00:25:40,124 --> 00:25:41,885
- You don't trump anything.
- I trump you.

537
00:25:43,231 --> 00:25:45,371
- You want to tell her--say she
trumps me, Nikkole.

538
00:25:45,474 --> 00:25:46,752
I want to hear it.

539
00:25:46,855 --> 00:25:49,271
- Listen, now I'm putting
a stop to it.

540
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:51,342
She's in labor, so you shut your
mouth, and you act like

541
00:25:51,446 --> 00:25:53,275
a grown person.
- All right, then!

542
00:25:53,379 --> 00:25:55,761
- Your only concern right now
is her.

543
00:25:55,864 --> 00:25:56,831
So suck it up, Joshua.

544
00:25:56,934 --> 00:25:59,627
Suck it up,
and act like a grown-up.

545
00:26:15,332 --> 00:26:17,679
- Josh's mom finally got
through to him, and things

546
00:26:17,783 --> 00:26:18,818
calmed down.

547
00:26:18,922 --> 00:26:20,199
- All right.

548
00:26:23,202 --> 00:26:24,583
- Don't be nervous.

549
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:29,346
- This is it.

550
00:26:29,449 --> 00:26:31,451
This is what we've been
waiting for.

551
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:39,667
- So you got this far.

552
00:26:39,770 --> 00:26:42,117
You got this far, so let's get
this baby out, okay?

553
00:26:42,221 --> 00:26:43,878
- Come on, push, Nikkole.
- I can't.

554
00:26:43,981 --> 00:26:46,639
- Push.
- I can't.

555
00:26:46,743 --> 00:26:48,434
- Come on, do it.
- Nikkole.

556
00:26:48,537 --> 00:26:50,781
- Yes, you can.
- Push that baby out.

557
00:26:50,885 --> 00:26:51,851
- Come on.

558
00:26:51,955 --> 00:26:54,405
- [crying]
- Harder, Nikkole.

559
00:26:54,509 --> 00:26:55,303
- I can't.

560
00:26:55,406 --> 00:26:56,269
- Good, good, push, push, push.

561
00:26:56,373 --> 00:26:57,961
- It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

562
00:26:58,064 --> 00:27:00,170
It hurts!

563
00:27:00,273 --> 00:27:02,310
- Come on, you can do it.
Oh, my god!

564
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:05,727
[baby crying]
- There's your baby.

565
00:27:05,831 --> 00:27:09,386
[baby squawking]

566
00:27:09,489 --> 00:27:10,456
- Lyle.

567
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:12,113
- He is bigger than eight
pounds, I think.

568
00:27:12,216 --> 00:27:14,149
- Wow, look at him.

569
00:27:14,253 --> 00:27:16,704
- He looks wonderful.

570
00:27:16,807 --> 00:27:18,878
- Good job.

571
00:27:18,982 --> 00:27:20,500
Good job.

572
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:33,479
[chime dings]

573
00:27:42,177 --> 00:27:44,870
- The last few days have been
really difficult.

574
00:27:44,973 --> 00:27:48,977
My mom and Josh have been
fighting almost the entire time.

575
00:27:49,081 --> 00:27:51,808
And now my mom won't let Josh
into our house, which means I

576
00:27:51,911 --> 00:27:54,949
have to go home alone and visit
Josh's family later.

577
00:28:02,577 --> 00:28:07,168
- I'm so exhausted and really
angry there was so much drama.

578
00:28:07,271 --> 00:28:08,687
- How you doing, Nikkole?

579
00:28:10,343 --> 00:28:11,172
- Are you tired?

580
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:17,834
- Those three days with Josh
was a little exhausting.

581
00:28:17,937 --> 00:28:20,250
I'm stressed.
I ain't had much sleep.

582
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,879
- Not only am I worn out by
all the fighting, but I'm in so

583
00:28:28,983 --> 00:28:32,711
much pain I can barely walk.

584
00:28:32,814 --> 00:28:39,269
- [crying]
- Don't cry.

585
00:28:39,372 --> 00:28:41,858
- [crying]

586
00:28:41,961 --> 00:28:42,790
Mom?

587
00:28:44,274 --> 00:28:45,689
- Oh, spit-up.

588
00:28:45,793 --> 00:28:48,243
- Ooh, what do I do?
- Pick him up.

589
00:28:48,347 --> 00:28:49,589
Put this on your shoulder.

590
00:28:49,693 --> 00:28:50,798
- Can he, like, choke?

591
00:28:50,901 --> 00:28:53,490
- He really didn't get that
much to choke.

592
00:28:53,593 --> 00:28:55,354
And then just kind of burp him.

593
00:28:55,457 --> 00:28:56,838
- Mom.
- Burp him.

594
00:28:56,942 --> 00:28:59,082
- Oh, it just went all over.

595
00:28:59,185 --> 00:29:00,704
- You're fine.
It's gonna happen.

596
00:29:00,808 --> 00:29:02,464
- That's disgusting.
- It's a burp.

597
00:29:02,568 --> 00:29:05,467
[doorbell rings]

598
00:29:10,507 --> 00:29:11,784
- Hey, Frankie. Come on in.

599
00:29:11,888 --> 00:29:13,165
- Hi.
- Hi.

600
00:29:13,268 --> 00:29:14,235
- Aw.

601
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,033
- Are you nervous?
- Kind of.

602
00:29:24,832 --> 00:29:26,005
- He's so little.

603
00:29:26,109 --> 00:29:26,972
- I'll go get a blanket.

604
00:29:27,075 --> 00:29:28,559
- No, he's not, dude.

605
00:29:28,663 --> 00:29:32,149
They had to cut my crotch open
so they could get him out.

606
00:29:32,253 --> 00:29:33,702
Isn't that sick?
- Did it hurt?

607
00:29:33,806 --> 00:29:34,876
- Yeah, I have stitches.

608
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,878
- Where's Josh?

609
00:29:36,982 --> 00:29:39,467
- He was gonna come back here,
but he and my mom got in

610
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:40,779
a big fight.

611
00:29:40,882 --> 00:29:42,056
- Why?

612
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,576
- He said some very mean things
to my mom.

613
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,994
And she said that he's not
allowed over here anymore.

614
00:29:49,097 --> 00:29:51,548
And she wouldn't let me go home
with him either.

615
00:29:51,651 --> 00:29:55,379
[baby squawks]
- He's gonna cry.

616
00:29:55,483 --> 00:29:57,140
- Oh, come here.

617
00:29:57,243 --> 00:29:59,004
- I can't believe you have
a baby.

618
00:29:59,107 --> 00:30:00,246
- I know, right?

619
00:30:00,350 --> 00:30:01,523
Don't ever do it.

620
00:30:01,627 --> 00:30:05,389
[laughter]
- [crying]

621
00:30:05,493 --> 00:30:08,841
Don't cry.

622
00:30:08,945 --> 00:30:10,705
Mom?
- Hold on just a second.

623
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,294
I'm trying to find baby wipes.

624
00:30:13,397 --> 00:30:15,399
- Aw, buddy.

625
00:30:15,503 --> 00:30:17,954
- I should probably go.
- Aw.

626
00:30:18,057 --> 00:30:19,093
- I'm so sorry.

627
00:30:19,196 --> 00:30:20,853
- I'll come visit him again.

628
00:30:20,957 --> 00:30:22,890
- All right.
- All right, bye.

629
00:30:22,993 --> 00:30:24,581
- Bye.

630
00:30:24,684 --> 00:30:30,345
- [crying]
Buddy.

631
00:30:30,449 --> 00:30:31,968
- Do you understand why I got
upset today?

632
00:30:32,071 --> 00:30:33,521
- Yeah.

633
00:30:33,624 --> 00:30:35,834
- And you're okay with him
being disrespectful?

634
00:30:35,937 --> 00:30:37,905
I think you see it.
You understand it.

635
00:30:38,008 --> 00:30:39,630
- I didn't want to deal with it
last night.

636
00:30:39,734 --> 00:30:40,631
I just ignored it last night.

637
00:30:40,735 --> 00:30:42,081
- You shouldn't ignore it.

638
00:30:42,185 --> 00:30:46,775
Also seeing him touch you, put
his whole body on you when you

639
00:30:46,879 --> 00:30:50,296
were trying to focus through
those labor pains, and I asked

640
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,885
him repeatedly to stop,
and he didn't stop.

641
00:30:52,989 --> 00:30:54,438
- It didn't bother me
really, though.

642
00:30:54,542 --> 00:30:56,544
- It doesn't matter.
It bothered me.

643
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:57,821
- Mm-hmm.

644
00:30:57,925 --> 00:30:59,823
- A lot of things about Josh
doesn't bother you.

645
00:30:59,927 --> 00:31:00,824
It should.

646
00:31:00,928 --> 00:31:01,998
But it doesn't.

647
00:31:02,101 --> 00:31:04,172
That angers me.
- Mm-hmm.

648
00:31:04,276 --> 00:31:05,760
Mom, don't cry.

649
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,589
- It was hard watching
all that.

650
00:31:13,492 --> 00:31:15,459
You need to really have
a serious talk with him.

651
00:31:15,563 --> 00:31:16,633
- I know.

652
00:31:19,394 --> 00:31:21,845
I'm going over to Josh's so he
can see Lyle and we can have

653
00:31:21,949 --> 00:31:23,260
a talk.

654
00:31:23,364 --> 00:31:25,573
What you said to my mom was
really disrespectful.

655
00:31:25,676 --> 00:31:27,678
- She did a bunch of crazy
stuff while she was there, and

656
00:31:27,782 --> 00:31:29,646
she's the one that looked
foolish, not me.

657
00:31:29,749 --> 00:31:30,889
- Josh.

658
00:31:30,992 --> 00:31:32,304
- And then she sat there and
called me immature.

659
00:31:32,407 --> 00:31:34,030
- You just need to put yourself
in her shoes.

660
00:31:34,133 --> 00:31:34,927
She was tripping out.

661
00:31:35,031 --> 00:31:36,515
- I was in her shoes.

662
00:31:36,618 --> 00:31:38,310
- All right, babe--
- I was completely in her shoes

663
00:31:38,413 --> 00:31:39,898
on the other side.

664
00:31:40,001 --> 00:31:41,589
- Mm-hmm.

665
00:31:41,692 --> 00:31:43,556
- She cared about you, and I
cared about you.

666
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,903
- Mm-hmm.

667
00:31:45,006 --> 00:31:47,491
- She thought she was better,
'cause she's your mom.

668
00:31:47,595 --> 00:31:50,080
- This right here is not about
your mother, believe it or not.

669
00:31:50,184 --> 00:31:51,357
- I love my mom.

670
00:31:51,461 --> 00:31:53,394
And I love you too.

671
00:31:53,497 --> 00:31:56,535
And as much as you don't like
her, she's gonna be a part of my

672
00:31:56,638 --> 00:31:59,089
life just as much as you are.

673
00:31:59,193 --> 00:32:01,333
So you guys are gonna have to
get along.

674
00:32:03,852 --> 00:32:05,061
- Yeah.

675
00:32:05,164 --> 00:32:06,925
- I don't know, dude,
like, whatever.

676
00:32:07,028 --> 00:32:12,171
I guess we'll go from when she
finally decides to apologize.

677
00:32:12,275 --> 00:32:14,553
- [sighs]

678
00:32:14,656 --> 00:32:15,830
I really hope I don't have to

679
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,591
choose between my mom and
Josh, because we're all

680
00:32:18,695 --> 00:32:19,938
connected now.

681
00:32:25,909 --> 00:32:28,808
- Since Lyle was born, my mom
and Josh have refused to speak

682
00:32:28,912 --> 00:32:30,224
to each other.

683
00:32:30,327 --> 00:32:32,536
And my mom has made it a rule
that he is not allowed in

684
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:33,572
our house.

685
00:32:35,505 --> 00:32:38,232
I've been bonding with Lyle, but
this is definitely not the

686
00:32:38,335 --> 00:32:40,406
family picture I had imagine.

687
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:43,168
So today, I convinced my mom and
Josh to meet

688
00:32:43,271 --> 00:32:44,479
and try and work things out.

689
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:45,998
- Where to begin?

690
00:32:46,102 --> 00:32:49,519
One of the things that I'm
really upset with you about is

691
00:32:49,622 --> 00:32:52,798
the fact that you're so
disrespectful to people, not

692
00:32:52,901 --> 00:32:57,734
only me: Nikkole, your parents,
everybody that you come in

693
00:32:57,837 --> 00:32:59,494
contact with. It's crazy.

694
00:32:59,598 --> 00:33:01,324
- That's the kind of person
I am.

695
00:33:01,427 --> 00:33:02,946
If you guys feel I was
disrespectful, I guess

696
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:03,982
I'm sorry.

697
00:33:04,085 --> 00:33:05,535
But I'm not gonna change
who I am.

698
00:33:05,638 --> 00:33:07,502
That's who I am.

699
00:33:07,606 --> 00:33:10,816
I don't even really understand
why you're mad at all.

700
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:13,853
I did not say one disrespectful
word to you.

701
00:33:13,957 --> 00:33:15,096
- Oh, no, let's see here.

702
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,753
I think you said,
"I'm number one.

703
00:33:16,856 --> 00:33:18,065
You're number two."

704
00:33:18,168 --> 00:33:21,309
that was the first thing that
pissed me off in that

705
00:33:21,413 --> 00:33:26,280
situation, 'cause you're never
gonna be number one.

706
00:33:26,383 --> 00:33:29,593
I'm her blood. I am number one.
- I am.

707
00:33:29,697 --> 00:33:30,422
- Yeah, okay.

708
00:33:30,525 --> 00:33:32,976
You're gonna think that.

709
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:36,600
- Well, I actually know it.

710
00:33:36,704 --> 00:33:39,017
- [sighs]

711
00:33:42,572 --> 00:33:44,539
- Will you try and resolve
things with my mom, please?

712
00:33:44,643 --> 00:33:47,232
- [bleep] No, dude. Come on.
- Stop.

713
00:33:47,335 --> 00:33:49,510
Seriously, stop.

714
00:33:49,613 --> 00:33:52,237
- You think I'm trying to be
mean right now?

715
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,928
- Stop being a jerk.

716
00:33:59,209 --> 00:34:00,314
What's wrong?

717
00:34:00,417 --> 00:34:02,212
- "What's wrong?"
Are you kidding me?

718
00:34:02,316 --> 00:34:03,696
- No.

719
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,595
- I could jump across that
table and whip the [bleep]--

720
00:34:05,698 --> 00:34:07,907
- I told him he was being
a smart-ass.

721
00:34:08,011 --> 00:34:10,220
- And you're okay with that?
- No, I told him to stop.

722
00:34:10,324 --> 00:34:12,602
You guys need to try and
resolve things.

723
00:34:12,705 --> 00:34:14,811
- I'm not gonna resolve it.
- Why?

724
00:34:14,914 --> 00:34:16,571
Okay, I'll be nice to him
because of the baby.

725
00:34:16,675 --> 00:34:19,057
But I never want to see you guys
together again, period.

726
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:20,472
- Why?
- I just don't.

727
00:34:20,575 --> 00:34:21,852
- But that's my decision.

728
00:34:21,956 --> 00:34:24,200
- He's not good for you.
- It's my decision, regardless.

729
00:34:24,303 --> 00:34:26,926
- Okay, well, you're still 16.
You're under my care.

730
00:34:27,030 --> 00:34:30,999
- I can move out when I'm 17.
- Good, great.

731
00:34:31,103 --> 00:34:33,795
Until then, you're gonna have
a lockdown, if that's what

732
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:35,487
it takes.
- Are you serious?

733
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,282
- Yeah.
- Why?

734
00:34:37,385 --> 00:34:38,628
- You don't need to be
with him.

735
00:34:38,731 --> 00:34:40,457
- All right, well, you have to
let me make those

736
00:34:40,561 --> 00:34:41,493
decisions myself.

737
00:34:41,596 --> 00:34:42,977
It's part of growing up.

738
00:34:45,566 --> 00:34:47,913
- [sighs]
Unfortunately, I know that.

739
00:34:54,299 --> 00:34:56,370
- It's been over a month,
and Josh is still banished from

740
00:34:56,473 --> 00:34:57,923
the house.

741
00:34:58,026 --> 00:35:00,684
But I'm back in school, and even
though my mom has been helping

742
00:35:00,788 --> 00:35:02,410
a lot, it's been really hard.

- Josh's mom works nights, so
she's been watching Lyle

751
00:35:35,202 --> 00:35:36,617
during the day.

752
00:35:39,309 --> 00:35:41,967
The only time Josh gets to see
Lyle is when I come over

753
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,313
after school.

754
00:35:43,417 --> 00:35:45,798
He tries to be a good dad.

755
00:35:45,902 --> 00:35:48,732
But because he has limited time
with Lyle, he hasn't quite

756
00:35:48,836 --> 00:35:50,907
gotten the hang
of the parenting thing.

You got to be quiet.
- All right, hold him, Josh.

760
00:35:58,086 --> 00:36:01,193
Maybe he'll stop crying if you
hold him.

761
00:36:01,297 --> 00:36:03,540
- You told me to move the baby.
This is what happens.

762
00:36:03,644 --> 00:36:05,163
- [crying]
- You move the sleeping baby,

763
00:36:05,266 --> 00:36:06,992
it starts crying.

764
00:36:07,095 --> 00:36:08,649
- [wailing]

765
00:36:08,752 --> 00:36:10,375
- It sucks that Josh
is acting like this,

766
00:36:10,478 --> 00:36:12,687
but that's the least
of my problems, 'cause I just

767
00:36:12,791 --> 00:36:17,244
found out he's been seeing his
ex behind my back.

768
00:36:17,347 --> 00:36:20,764
Like, last week Becca called me
and told me that Josh is hanging

769
00:36:20,868 --> 00:36:22,387
out with Kyla.

770
00:36:22,490 --> 00:36:25,148
And he denied it, and then she
started texting me and telling

771
00:36:25,252 --> 00:36:27,909
me that they were hanging out,
and that she was, like, falling

772
00:36:28,013 --> 00:36:29,980
in love with him and all
this crap.

773
00:36:30,084 --> 00:36:32,120
And so then he finally
admitted it.

774
00:36:32,224 --> 00:36:35,227
- He just, like, thinks it's
okay to talk to you and Kyla?

775
00:36:35,331 --> 00:36:37,264
- Yeah, pretty much.

776
00:36:37,367 --> 00:36:40,750
- So why do you think that
Josh, like, does all--like, he

777
00:36:40,853 --> 00:36:44,995
acts like he's in love with you,
and he'll just run off and do

778
00:36:45,099 --> 00:36:47,066
things you don't want him to do?

779
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:49,931
- He just does whatever he
wants without thinking about

780
00:36:50,035 --> 00:36:51,312
what's gonna happen.

781
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:52,693
He doesn't really care about
other people's feelings

782
00:36:52,796 --> 00:36:54,142
that much.

783
00:36:54,246 --> 00:36:57,939
Like, "Oh, I just popped out
your kid a month ago."

784
00:36:58,043 --> 00:36:59,458
It's like he doesn't
really care.

785
00:36:59,562 --> 00:37:01,115
- Yeah.

786
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,979
- What, like, what would you do
if you found out your boyfriend

787
00:37:03,082 --> 00:37:04,808
was cheating on you?

788
00:37:04,912 --> 00:37:08,709
- I probably wouldn't, like,
go back to him.

789
00:37:08,812 --> 00:37:11,436
But I know it's, like, harder
for you.

790
00:37:11,539 --> 00:37:14,715
You're gonna have to--
- See him all the time.

791
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:17,165
I can't believe Josh hasn't
changed, and after all this

792
00:37:17,269 --> 00:37:20,203
time, he's still cheating on me.

793
00:37:21,584 --> 00:37:24,759
And now he wants to meet me to
explain what's going on.

794
00:37:24,863 --> 00:37:25,795
- Is he sleeping?

795
00:37:25,898 --> 00:37:26,899
- Yeah.

796
00:37:27,003 --> 00:37:28,418
Don't mess with him.

797
00:37:28,522 --> 00:37:29,937
- He's a cutie.

798
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:33,043
The reason I wanted you to come
is to talk about the situation.

799
00:37:33,147 --> 00:37:35,356
So, like, I ran into Kyla.

800
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:39,912
And that one night--you, like,
know I used to date her.

801
00:37:40,016 --> 00:37:41,466
- Mm-hmm.

802
00:37:41,569 --> 00:37:44,123
- So I don't know, like, a lot
of feelings came back,

803
00:37:44,227 --> 00:37:45,573
but I'm trying to sort them out.

804
00:37:45,677 --> 00:37:48,266
Like, I feel like I do love you.

805
00:37:48,369 --> 00:37:53,063
But I'm just
not ready to, like...

806
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:57,516
totally commit myself to you.

807
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:00,795
- I just don't, like, want you
to just break up with me so that

808
00:38:00,899 --> 00:38:04,351
you can hook up with other girls
and then still expect me to be

809
00:38:04,454 --> 00:38:06,214
there in the end.
- That's not how it is at all.

810
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:08,182
- It's just not fair to me,
really.

811
00:38:08,286 --> 00:38:10,357
- [disgusted sigh]
- It's not.

812
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:13,014
No, 'cause I've already let you
do this, like, twice.

813
00:38:13,118 --> 00:38:15,741
- What's not fair?
All right then. Whatever.

814
00:38:15,845 --> 00:38:22,541
I'm done talking about it,
'cause I already did it.

815
00:38:22,645 --> 00:38:24,509
I'm not making you stay.

816
00:38:24,612 --> 00:38:26,096
- I'm not gonna be
here forever.

817
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:28,064
- All right then. Don't be.

818
00:38:28,167 --> 00:38:29,790
- I'm just telling you I'm not
going to.

819
00:38:29,893 --> 00:38:30,791
- All right then.

820
00:38:30,894 --> 00:38:32,206
And I'm over it.

821
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,760

don't want to.

- And how do you feel
about that?

833
00:39:16,802 --> 00:39:18,735
- Sad.

834
00:39:18,839 --> 00:39:20,530
I don't want him to leave.

835
00:39:23,671 --> 00:39:25,846
- Does he know how upset
you are?

836
00:39:29,056 --> 00:39:29,919
- Yeah.

837
00:39:33,578 --> 00:39:36,132
Before I had Lyle, I was hoping
that me and Josh could be

838
00:39:36,235 --> 00:39:39,756
really close, and we could be
like a family with our child.

839
00:39:39,860 --> 00:39:43,242
But it really has
had the opposite effect.

840
00:39:45,417 --> 00:39:49,007
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

841
00:39:49,110 --> 00:39:51,872
- You can open some gifts
for Lyle.

842
00:39:51,975 --> 00:39:55,013
- At 16, I definitely
don't think I was ready to be a

843
00:39:55,116 --> 00:39:58,188
mom, and I still don't think I'm
ready to be a mom.

844
00:39:58,292 --> 00:40:00,501
But I think I'm doing the best
I can.

845
00:40:00,605 --> 00:40:02,469
- Put your arm around her.
Go on.

846
00:40:02,572 --> 00:40:05,161
- There you go, aw.

847
00:40:05,264 --> 00:40:07,991
- My mom being here and helping
me take care of Lyle has made

848
00:40:08,095 --> 00:40:09,786
things a lot easier for me.

849
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:10,891
- [crying]

850
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:15,654
- I like sleep.

851
00:40:15,758 --> 00:40:17,794
I don't think my mom and Josh
will ever make up, because they

852
00:40:17,898 --> 00:40:20,141
disagree with each other
completely.

853
00:40:20,245 --> 00:40:22,799
I don't know what's gonna happen
with me and Josh in the future.

854
00:40:22,903 --> 00:40:25,768
Even though Josh has hurt me
a lot, I still love him.

855
00:40:25,871 --> 00:40:28,805
And I hope that we end up
being together.

856
00:40:28,909 --> 00:40:30,911
I still have a year and a half
left of high school, but I'm

857
00:40:31,014 --> 00:40:35,847
really still determined to
graduate and go on to college.

858
00:40:35,950 --> 00:40:36,917
- It still fits.

859
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,539
- Yeah.
- Awesome.

860
00:40:38,643 --> 00:40:40,610
That looks really cute.

861
00:40:40,714 --> 00:40:43,682
- Even though I love Lyle, I
wish that I would have waited to

862
00:40:43,786 --> 00:40:47,755
have children, because I can't
be as carefree as I used to be.

863
00:40:47,859 --> 00:40:50,137
And if I could have made
a different decision,

864
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,690
then I would have.

865
00:41:06,912 --> 00:41:08,535
- We don't have any reason
to be talking

866
00:41:08,638 --> 00:41:09,812
unless it's about the baby.

867
00:41:09,915 --> 00:41:12,400
It's not fair at all, Matt,
for you to just do

868
00:41:12,504 --> 00:41:15,300
whatever you want to me and you
expect me to just do it.

869
00:41:15,403 --> 00:41:17,198
I just don't want him
in the picture,

870
00:41:17,302 --> 00:41:19,200
because he's not fit
to be a dad at all.

871
00:41:19,304 --> 00:41:21,513
It hurts, Dad.
I'm just trying to be calm.

872
00:41:21,617 --> 00:41:22,894
- Come on, come on.

873
00:41:22,997 --> 00:41:24,689
Just tell him we're on our way
to the hospital.

874
00:41:24,792 --> 00:41:27,001
- [groaning]
- Give me a big push now.

875
00:41:27,105 --> 00:41:28,727
- Look at that.
