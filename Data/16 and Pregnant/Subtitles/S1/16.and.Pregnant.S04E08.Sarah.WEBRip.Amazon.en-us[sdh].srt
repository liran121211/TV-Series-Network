1
00:00:03,171 --> 00:00:04,405
>> I JUST LOVE THE BACK OF IT.

2
00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:06,140
HI, MY NAME'S SARAH.

3
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,641
I'M 16, AND I LIVE IN

4
00:00:07,641 --> 00:00:09,077
CHICKAMAUGA, GEORGIA,

5
00:00:09,077 --> 00:00:10,078
RIGHT ACROSS THE BORDER FROM

6
00:00:10,078 --> 00:00:11,645
CHATTANOOGA, TENNESSEE.

7
00:00:11,645 --> 00:00:13,114
I LOVE BEING OUTDOORS AND

8
00:00:13,114 --> 00:00:16,450
SPENDING TIME WITH MY FRIENDS.

9
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,518
[chime dings]

10
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:18,952
AND AFTER HIGH SCHOOL, I REALLY

11
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,188
WANT TO STUDY JOURNALISM IN

12
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:21,555
COLLEGE.

13
00:00:21,555 --> 00:00:22,956
[laughs]

14
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,024
I LIVE WITH MY MOM AND TWO

15
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:24,825
BROTHERS.

16
00:00:24,825 --> 00:00:26,527
MY DAD LEFT WHEN I WAS YOUNGER,

17
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:27,728
BUT I'VE BEEN SUPER CLOSE WITH

18
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,297
MY MOM EVER SINCE.

19
00:00:29,297 --> 00:00:30,931
SHE EVEN DOES MY HAIR AND MAKEUP

20
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:31,799
EVERY MORNING.

21
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:32,966
I LIKE HAVING IT DONE.

22
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:34,202
I JUST DON'T LIKE DOING IT.

23
00:00:34,202 --> 00:00:36,036
THE ONLY PERSON I'M CLOSER TO IS

24
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,438
MY BOYFRIEND, BLAKE.

25
00:00:37,438 --> 00:00:39,407
WE MET IN SIXTH GRADE, AND WE'VE

26
00:00:39,407 --> 00:00:40,741
BEEN DATING OFF AND ON FOR FIVE

27
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:42,410
YEARS.

28
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,777
BLAKE LOVES WORKING ON BOATS AND

29
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:44,845
GOING FISHING.

30
00:00:44,845 --> 00:00:46,013
>> WE CAN GO FISHING FOR CRAPPIE

31
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:46,747
AND BASS.

32
00:00:46,747 --> 00:00:47,815
>> ALL THE FISH LOOK THE SAME TO

33
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:49,016
ME.

34
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:50,351
ONE DAY HE HOPES TO BE A SHRIMP

35
00:00:50,351 --> 00:00:51,852
BOAT CAPTAIN.

36
00:00:51,852 --> 00:00:53,020
MY MOM AND BLAKE DON'T ALWAYS

37
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,688
SEE EYE TO EYE, ESPECIALLY SINCE

38
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:55,689
HE DROPPED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL

39
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:57,158
LAST YEAR AFTER FALLING BEHIND

40
00:00:57,158 --> 00:00:58,759
ON HIS GRADE.

41
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,261
NOW HE WORKS A FEW HOURS A WEEK

42
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:01,895
AT THE LOCAL GROCERY STORE

43
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:03,364
AND SPENDS THE REST OF HIS TIME

44
00:01:03,364 --> 00:01:05,999
PLAYING VIDEO GAMES AT MY HOUSE.

45
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:07,168
BUT THEY'LL HAVE TO FIND A WAY

46
00:01:07,168 --> 00:01:10,037
TO GET ALONG SOON BECAUSE I'M

47
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:11,905
PREGNANT.

48
00:01:20,448 --> 00:01:21,682
BLAKE AND I RECENTLY FOUND OUT

49
00:01:21,682 --> 00:01:23,217
WE'RE HAVING A GIRL AND ARE

50
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:24,051
NAMING HER TINLEIGH.

51
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:25,353
OH, NO, I GOT IT CAUGHT

52
00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:26,053
ON A TREE.

53
00:01:26,053 --> 00:01:27,255
WE'RE TRYING TO ENJOY EVERY

54
00:01:27,255 --> 00:01:28,556
MINUTE OF SUMMER VACATION

55
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:30,023
TOGETHER, 'CAUSE WE WON'T HAVE

56
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:31,459
MUCH TIME TO OURSELVES AFTER

57
00:01:31,459 --> 00:01:32,426
THE BABY COMES.

58
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,395
REMEMBER WHENEVER WE WERE

59
00:01:34,395 --> 00:01:35,963
OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL AND I DREW

60
00:01:35,963 --> 00:01:37,598
ALL OVER YOU WITH THE SHARPIES?

61
00:01:37,598 --> 00:01:38,399
>> YEAH.

62
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:39,600
WHAT, FIRST TIME WE MET,

63
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,234
WASN'T IT?

64
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:40,968
>> YEAH.

65
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:42,035
WHY DID YOU DECIDE TO ASK ME

66
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:42,670
OUT?

67
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,471
LIKE, WHAT'D YOU--

68
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:44,505
>> YOU'RE JUST CUTE AND FUN,

69
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:45,739
AND I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

70
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:46,707
INTERESTING.

71
00:01:46,707 --> 00:01:48,676
YOU WAS PRETTY FUN GIRL TO TALK

72
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:50,344
TO AND HANG OUT WITH, SO...

73
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:51,879
>> I GUESS SOMETIMES, LIKE,

74
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:53,381
I WISH THAT WE HAD JUST, LIKE,

75
00:01:53,381 --> 00:01:55,449
HAD A LITTLE BIT LONGER, JUST ME

76
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:58,819
AND YOU, BEFORE I GOT PREGNANT,

77
00:01:58,819 --> 00:01:59,487
YOU KNOW?

78
00:01:59,487 --> 00:02:00,154
>> YEAH.

79
00:02:00,154 --> 00:02:01,289
>> LIKE, I HAD GOTTEN BIRTH

80
00:02:01,289 --> 00:02:03,157
CONTROL OR SOMETHING THAT WE

81
00:02:03,157 --> 00:02:04,325
SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT THEN,

82
00:02:04,325 --> 00:02:05,293
I GUESS.

83
00:02:05,293 --> 00:02:06,994
DO YOU WISH WE HAD?

84
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:08,196
>> YEAH.

85
00:02:08,196 --> 00:02:09,197
YEAH, SOMETIMES.

86
00:02:09,197 --> 00:02:10,798
BUT SOMETIMES NOT SO MUCH,

87
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,366
JUST BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY MADE

88
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:14,502
IT THIS FAR, BEING TEENAGERS

89
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:16,937
AND, YOU KNOW, BEING KIDS.

90
00:02:16,937 --> 00:02:17,605
>> YEAH.

91
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:18,606
>> YOU KNOW, MAYBE WE CAN MAKE

92
00:02:18,606 --> 00:02:19,773
IT BEING GROWN.

93
00:02:19,773 --> 00:02:22,109
PRETTY CONFIDENT WE WILL.

94
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:23,311
YOU KNOW?

95
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:27,047
>> YEAH, I THINK SO.

96
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:28,649
WHEN BLAKE AND I FOUND OUT I WAS

97
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,684
PREGNANT, WE WERE REALLY SCARED

98
00:02:30,684 --> 00:02:32,386
TO TELL OUR PARENTS, ESPECIALLY

99
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:33,421
MY MOM.

100
00:02:33,421 --> 00:02:35,055
SHE NEVER LIKED BLAKE THAT MUCH

101
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:37,291
BEFORE, AND THE BABY NEWS DIDN'T

102
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,392
MAKE THEIR RELATIONSHIP ANY

103
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:39,360
BETTER.

104
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,462
NEEDLESS TO SAY, MY MOM TOTALLY

105
00:02:41,462 --> 00:02:42,696
FREAKED.

106
00:02:42,696 --> 00:02:43,831
BUT SINCE BLAKE DOESN'T GET

107
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:45,299
ALONG WITH HIS FAMILY, SHE

108
00:02:45,299 --> 00:02:46,534
DECIDED TO PUT ASIDE HER

109
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:48,168
DIFFERENCES AND LET HIM MOVE IN

110
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,137
SO HE CAN BE HERE FOR THE BABY.

111
00:02:50,137 --> 00:02:51,639
BUT BLAKE STILL HASN'T GIVEN UP

112
00:02:51,639 --> 00:02:53,140
HIS DREAM OF GOING DOWN TO

113
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,408
SOUTH GEORGIA TO WORK ON

114
00:02:54,408 --> 00:02:56,510
A SHRIMPING BOAT.

115
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:57,245
>> [sighs]

116
00:02:57,245 --> 00:02:59,713
WELL, I KNOW WHEN, YOU KNOW,

117
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:00,714
I FOUND OUT YOU WERE PREGNANT,

118
00:03:00,714 --> 00:03:02,216
I PROBABLY DIDN'T HAVE THE

119
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:03,651
REACTION YOU EXPECTED.

120
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:04,318
>> YEAH.

121
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:05,253
>> LIKE, THE WHOLE NIGHT,

122
00:03:05,253 --> 00:03:06,720
I KEPT THINKING, YOU KNOW, THAT,

123
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,688
YOU KNOW, YOU WOULD NEVER DO

124
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,089
THIS.

125
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:10,391
I KNEW, YOU KNOW, YOU HAD DREAMS

126
00:03:10,391 --> 00:03:12,293
TO GO TO SCHOOL FOR JOURNALISM.

127
00:03:12,293 --> 00:03:13,627
AND, YOU KNOW, IT JUST, LIKE,

128
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:16,564
TOTALLY CHANGES YOUR LIFE PLAN.

129
00:03:16,564 --> 00:03:18,031
>> AND NOW BLAKE LIVES HERE WITH

130
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:20,301
US, SO IT'S KIND OF A BIG

131
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:21,402
CHANGE.

132
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:23,504
>> SOMETIMES I WONDER IF THAT

133
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:25,138
WAS THE RIGHT DECISION.

134
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:26,707
>> YOU AND BLAKE, SOMETIMES YOU

135
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:28,075
LIKE EACH OTHER, AND SOMETIMES

136
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:29,042
YOU REALLY DON'T LIKE EACH

137
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:29,777
OTHER.

138
00:03:29,777 --> 00:03:30,744
>> I JUST DON'T LIKE THE WAY

139
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:32,012
THAT HE TREATS YOU SOMETIMES.

140
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:33,747
I WANT HAPPINESS FOR YOU AND

141
00:03:33,747 --> 00:03:34,748
TINLEIGH, YOU KNOW?

142
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:35,483
>> YEAH.

143
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:37,885
>> AND HOPEFULLY HE'LL BE

144
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:41,889
SUPPORTIVE AND, YOU KNOW,

145
00:03:41,889 --> 00:03:43,524
DO WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO.

146
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:44,725
>> SOMETIMES HE TALKS ABOUT JUST

147
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:45,926
GETTING HIS G.E.D.

148
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:47,695
>> DO YOU THINK HE'S GONNA STAY

149
00:03:47,695 --> 00:03:49,630
UNTIL TINLEIGH'S BORN AND THEN

150
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,531
GO BACK?

151
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:51,665
>> IT'S JUST SOMETHING THAT WE

152
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:52,966
HAVE TO, LIKE, THINK ABOUT AND

153
00:03:52,966 --> 00:03:53,934
TALK ABOUT.

154
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,269
I'M GONNA TRY TO CONVINCE HIM TO

155
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:56,437
STAY HERE WITH US BECAUSE I WANT

156
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:57,805
HIM TO HELP WITH THE BABY.

157
00:03:57,805 --> 00:03:59,172
>> IF HE WANTS TO BE WITH YOU,

158
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:00,207
THEN HE'LL DO THE THINGS THAT

159
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:01,309
YOU TELL HIM HE NEEDS TO DO.

160
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:04,678
>> YEAH.

161
00:04:04,678 --> 00:04:05,546
GOOD MORNING.

162
00:04:05,546 --> 00:04:06,314
>> GOOD MORNING.

163
00:04:06,314 --> 00:04:07,881
>> I'M DUE IN JUST FOUR WEEKS,

164
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:09,317
AND BLAKE AND I STILL HAVE A TON

165
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:10,784
OF STUFF TO GET FOR THE BABY'S

166
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:12,653
ROOM.

167
00:04:16,457 --> 00:04:18,326
>> [bleep].

168
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:25,633
>> YEAH.

169
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:27,267
>> ALRIGHTY.

170
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,168
SO DID YOU GET SICK THIS

171
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:29,036
MORNING?

172
00:04:29,036 --> 00:04:29,903
>> NO, NOT YET.

173
00:04:29,903 --> 00:04:31,439
>> WHAT USUALLY MAKES YOU SICK?

174
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:34,408
>> STUFF WITH A LOT OF SUGAR...

175
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:37,010
AND MILK.

176
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:39,680
HOW'S YOUR CEREAL?

177
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:40,881
YOU'RE DEFINITELY NOT A MORNING

178
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:43,684
PERSON.

179
00:04:43,684 --> 00:04:45,285
THE THING IS, BLAKE DOESN'T

180
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,354
REALLY LIKE LIVING UNDER MY

181
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:47,521
MOM'S RULES.

182
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:48,756
[chime dings]

183
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:50,090
SHE EXPECTS HIM TO HELP OUT WITH

184
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,092
CHORES AROUND THE HOUSE AND SAVE

185
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:53,461
AT LEAST $10 A WEEK FROM HIS

186
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:54,728
PAYCHECK TO HELP ME PAY FOR

187
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:57,465
DIAPERS.

188
00:04:57,465 --> 00:04:58,866
BUT BLAKE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE

189
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:00,100
KEEPING UP HIS END OF THE

190

THE TIME CAME TO GET IT,

376
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:07,908
HE DITCHED ME AND WENT OFF WITH

377
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:08,608
HIS FRIEND.

378
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:09,977
>> WHERE'S HE OFF TO NOW?

379
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:12,179
>> I DON'T KNOW.

380
00:10:12,179 --> 00:10:13,346
>> SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

381
00:10:13,346 --> 00:10:14,748
>> MAKING A TO-DO LIST.

382
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:16,183
I HOPE HE TAKES THE HINT AND

383
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:17,584
DOES THE THINGS ON THE LIST...

384
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:18,385
[chime dings]

385
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:19,987
'CAUSE MY MOM ISN'T GONNA PUT UP

386
00:10:19,987 --> 00:10:23,824
WITH HIS ATTITUDE MUCH LONGER.

387
00:10:23,824 --> 00:10:26,526
[line ringing]

388
00:10:26,526 --> 00:10:27,594
>> HEY.

389
00:10:27,594 --> 00:10:28,729
>> I WROTE A LIST OF THINGS I

390
00:10:28,729 --> 00:10:30,097
NEED YOU TO DO WHEN YOU GET

391
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:31,298
HOME, AND I'M JUST GONNA READ IT

392
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:33,166
TO YOU SO THAT, UM--

393
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:37,504
>> TELL HIM--OR IF HE CAN HEAR

394
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,807
ME--THAT HE LIVES HERE FOR FREE

395
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:41,608
AND THAT HE NEEDS TO DO WHATEVER

396
00:10:41,608 --> 00:10:43,443
HE'S ASKED TO DO.

397
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:46,780
>> I NEED YOU TO GO PICK UP THE

398
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,981
CRIB FROM MY AUNT, BECAUSE

399
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,049
TINLEIGH WILL BE HERE ANY DAY,

400
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,183
AND SHE NEEDS SOMETHING TO

401
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,019
SLEEP IN.

402
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,255
>> THIS STUFF NEEDS TO GET DONE,

403
00:10:55,255 --> 00:10:57,357
AND, YOU KNOW, SHE'S PREGNANT.

404
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:59,226
YOU NEED TO HELP HER OUT.

405
00:11:01,294 --> 00:11:02,930
I GUESS WHEN I GET OFF WORK,

406
00:11:02,930 --> 00:11:03,831
I CAN DO IT.

407
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:04,932
>> YOU DON'T WORK ALL THE TIME.

408
00:11:04,932 --> 00:11:06,834
YOUR JOB IS NOT THAT HARD.

409
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:09,502
IT MAY TAKE A FEW DAYS.

410
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,371
IT'S JUST THAT...

411
00:11:12,072 --> 00:11:13,941
ALL RIGHT, BYE.

412
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:18,045
>> IT'S NOT GONNA GET EASIER

413
00:11:18,045 --> 00:11:19,880
WHEN THERE'S A BABY.

414
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:23,884
>> REALLY GOOD TO BE OUT THE

415
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:24,551
HOUSE, MAN.

416
00:11:24,551 --> 00:11:26,153
I DON'T LIKE BEING HOME OR AT

417
00:11:26,153 --> 00:11:26,820
THE HOUSE.

418
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,722
YOU KNOW HOW I AM.

419
00:11:30,758 --> 00:11:32,525
>> IT'S GONNA BE HARD, MAN.

420
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,227
IT'S GONNA BE A LOT DIFFERENT.

421
00:11:34,227 --> 00:11:35,162
IT'S A WHOLE NOTHER BIT OF

422
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:36,329
RESPONSIBILITY.

423
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:37,330
BESIDES TAKING CARE OF MYSELF,

424
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:38,665
I GOT TO TAKE CARE OF TWO OTHER

425
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:40,567
PEOPLE.

426
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:42,435
YOU KNOW?

427
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:45,505
>> YEAH, AND, LIKE, I STILL WANT

428
00:11:45,505 --> 00:11:47,174
TO BE A KID, IN A WAY, YOU KNOW?

429
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:48,241
LIKE, DON'T I WANT TO BE A

430
00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:49,142
KIDDIE-KID, BUT BEFORE

431
00:11:49,142 --> 00:11:50,377
TINLEIGH'S HERE, YOU KNOW,

432
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:51,411
I WANT TO HAVE FUN.

433
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,512
THAT'S WHY WE'RE OUT HERE RIGHT

434
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:53,180
NOW.

435
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,181
I WANT TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF

436
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:55,849
FUN.

437
00:11:57,617 --> 00:11:59,586
>> I DON'T--I DON'T WANT TO.

438
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:01,454
I CAN'T TAKE IT.

439
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:08,195
SOMETIMES I'D RATHER JUST PAY

440
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:09,162
CHILD SUPPORT AND GET OUT OF

441
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:10,964
HERE.

442
00:12:24,778 --> 00:12:25,846
>> EVEN AFTER GIVING HIM HIS

443
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:27,480
TO-DO LIST, BLAKE STILL DOESN'T

444
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,415
SEEM TO BE PUTTING IN MUCH

445
00:12:28,415 --> 00:12:29,249
EFFORT.

446
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:30,517
HE STAYED OUT WITH HIS FRIEND

447
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:31,919
ALL NIGHT.

448
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:33,586
WAKE UP.

449
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,754
WE NEED TO PICK UP THE CRIB

450
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,656
TODAY FROM MY AUNT.

451
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:43,696
WE REALLY HAVE SO MUCH TO DO

452
00:12:43,696 --> 00:12:44,998
BEFORE THE BABY COMES.

453
00:12:44,998 --> 00:12:46,800
>> YEAH, YOU DO, AND HE'S REALLY

454
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:47,835
PISSING ME OFF.

455
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:49,069
DID HE EVER EVEN CALL HER ABOUT

456
00:12:49,069 --> 00:12:49,769
THE CRIB?

457
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,703
>> I DON'T KNOW.

458
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,372
HE'S LIKE TALKING TO A BRICK

459
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:53,006
WALL.

460
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:54,107
>> WELL, ALL HE HAS TO DO IS GO

461
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,375
GET IT AND PUT IT TOGETHER.

462
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,609
>> I CAN'T KEEP WAITING FOR IT.

463
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,310
>> NO.

464
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,311
WHY ISN'T HE DOING ANYTHING

465
00:12:58,311 --> 00:12:58,979
FOR YOU?

466
00:12:58,979 --> 00:12:59,980
>> HE'S LIKE, "WELL, YOUR MOM

467
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:00,981
DOES EVERYTHING FOR YOU," AND

468
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:01,781
I'M LIKE, "WELL"--

469
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:02,615
>> THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

470
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:03,616
I DO THINGS FOR YOU BECAUSE HE

471
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:04,217
DON'T.

472
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:05,285
>> YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I TOLD HIM.

473
00:13:05,285 --> 00:13:06,286
I WAS LIKE, "YOU DON'T OFFER,

474
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,856
OR YOU WON'T DO ANYTHING THAT

475
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:09,923
I WANT YOU TO DO."

476
00:13:09,923 --> 00:13:10,891
>> YOU DON'T NEED THIS RIGHT

477
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:11,491
NOW.

478
00:13:11,491 --> 00:13:12,492
YOU'RE 8 1/2 MONTHS PREGNANT,

479
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:13,693
AND YOU DON'T NEED THE STRESS.

480
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:14,361
>> YEAH.

481
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:15,262
>> HE BETTER START TAKING

482
00:13:15,262 --> 00:13:16,396
RESPONSIBILITY, BECAUSE I'M NOT

483
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:17,865
GONNA TOLERATE THIS BEHAVIOR.

484
00:13:17,865 --> 00:13:20,834
>> YEAH.

485
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:22,202
>> HE'S SO IMMATURE.

486
00:13:22,202 --> 00:13:23,370
WHEN IS HE GONNA START GIVING

487
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:25,238
YOU MONEY FOR THE BABY INSTEAD

488
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:26,907
OF SPENDING IT ALL ON HIMSELF?

489
00:13:26,907 --> 00:13:28,808
>> YEAH.

490
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:30,377
BLAKE HASN'T SAID ANYTHING ABOUT

491
00:13:30,377 --> 00:13:31,879
GETTING THE CRIB, AND IT'S

492
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:34,414
REALLY ANNOYING ME AND MY MOM.

493
00:13:34,414 --> 00:13:35,482
SHE WOULDN'T EVEN RIDE IN THE

494
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:36,783
SAME CAR WITH US TO MY DOCTOR'S

495
00:13:36,783 --> 00:13:40,720
APPOINTMENT TODAY.

496
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,955
>> WHY'D YOUR MOM TAKE A

497
00:13:41,955 --> 00:13:45,025
DIFFERENT CAR, YOU THINK?

498
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:46,927
>> I DON'T KNOW.

499
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,064
PISSES ME OFF, MORE AND MORE

500
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:53,333
I THINK ABOUT IT.

501
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,402
THAT'S WHY I DON'T LIKE STAYING

502
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:56,069
HERE.

503
00:13:56,069 --> 00:13:57,938
IT'S 'CAUSE I'M NOT WELCOME.

504
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:06,613
>> YOU THINK YOU'RE SO COOL.

505
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:07,714
"ASK ME TO DO IT.

506
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:08,515
ASK ME TO DO IT."

507
00:14:08,515 --> 00:14:09,516
I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BEG YOU TO

508
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:10,951
DO [bleep] FOR YOUR OWN KID.

509
00:14:10,951 --> 00:14:11,784
>> AND DO WHAT?

00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,320
LIKE, WHAT IS THERE TO DO?

511
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,287
>> THERE'S PLENTY OF [bleep]

512
00:14:14,287 --> 00:14:14,888
TO DO.

513
00:14:14,888 --> 00:14:15,855
>> OKAY THEN, WELL, I'LL DO

514
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,556
THAT FOR YOU.

515
00:14:16,556 --> 00:14:17,490
>> BLAKE, CAN YOU GET OFF

516

>> DO YOU DO ANYTHING?

518
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:20,027
>> I DO WAY MORE THAN YOU DO.

519
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:21,228
>> THAT'S BULL[bleep], THOUGH.

520
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:21,929
>> NO.

521
00:14:21,929 --> 00:14:22,595
>> SHUT UP.

522
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:23,596
I'M TIRED OF LISTENING TO YOU

523
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,032

RIDE WITH YOUR MOM BACK HOME,

525
00:14:26,366 --> 00:14:28,902
DAMN, PLEASE.

526
00:14:38,411 --> 00:14:39,646
>> WHILE WE WAITED FOR THEM TO

527
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:41,048
SCHEDULE MY NEXT APPOINTMENT,

528
00:14:41,048 --> 00:14:42,349
THE TENSION BETWEEN BLAKE AND MY

529
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:44,684
MOM STARTED STRESSING ME OUT.

530
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,253
>> I NEED TO GET TINLEIGH'S BED.

531
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:48,188
IT'S JUST STRESSING ME OUT,

532
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:50,090
HER NOT HAVING A PLACE TO SLEEP.

533
00:14:50,090 --> 00:14:51,291
SHE NEEDS HER BED.

534
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,993
>> DID YOU TEXT HER ABOUT

535
00:14:52,993 --> 00:14:53,760
GETTING THE BED?

536
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,394
>> MM-MM.

537
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:55,428
NOT YET.

538
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:56,964
>> WELL, LET'S MAKE THAT HAPPEN.

539
00:14:56,964 --> 00:14:58,031
BABY NEEDS A BED.

540
00:14:58,031 --> 00:14:59,199
>> I'M MAKING IT A POINT TO ASK

541
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:00,367
YOU TO DO SOMETHING, SO IF YOU

542
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:01,301
COULD DO IT, THAT WOULD BE

543
00:15:01,301 --> 00:15:01,868
GREAT.

544
00:15:01,868 --> 00:15:02,669
>> OKAY, GOD DAMN.

545
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:03,336
DUMBASS.

00:15:04,972 --> 00:15:05,805
>> OKAY.

549
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:06,839

00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:13,580
>> HOW?

556
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,247

00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:16,116
HOW?

560
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,495
>> HEY, YES, I DO.

561
00:15:28,495 --> 00:15:29,196
>> OKAY.

562
00:15:29,196 --> 00:15:30,297
>> BECAUSE OF HER, SHE MAKES ME

563
00:15:30,297 --> 00:15:31,198
FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE.

564
00:15:31,198 --> 00:15:32,465
YOU WANT ME TO BE HONEST

565
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:33,166
WITH YOU?

566
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,101
I'M BEING HONEST WITH YOU

567
00:15:34,101 --> 00:15:34,767
RIGHT NOW.

568
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,868
SHE MAKES ME FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE

569
00:15:35,868 --> 00:15:39,572
AT MY OWN BABY'S DOCTOR'S

570
00:15:39,572 --> 00:15:41,108
APPOINTMENT.

571
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:42,575
I JUST DON'T EVEN WANT TO PUT UP

572
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:43,276
WITH IT.

573
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,244
LIKE, THAT'S WHY I DON'T SAY

574
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:45,345
NOTHING.

575
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:46,079
>> OKAY.

576
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:47,114
>> JUST 'CAUSE I DON'T FEEL LIKE

577
00:15:47,114 --> 00:15:48,148
LISTENING TO LIP FROM BOTH OF

578
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:49,449
Y'ALL.

579
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,384
I CAN'T DO IT WITH TWO PEOPLE

580
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:53,653
TAG-TEAMING ME WHEN I'M THERE,

581
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:56,423
YOU AND YOUR MOM, LIKE, [bleep].

582
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:58,625
SHE AIN'T IN THIS RELATIONSHIP.

583
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,826
WHY DOES SHE HAVE TO START IN

584
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:02,629
ON ME?

585
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:04,497
I DO WANT TO LEAVE.

586
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:06,233
>> YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL ABOUT IT.

587
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:07,500
I TOLD YOU I NEED TO STAY HERE

588
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,102
AND FINISH HIGH SCHOOL, BUT IT

589
00:16:09,102 --> 00:16:10,570
WOULD BE--IF YOU WOULD BE THAT

590
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:11,904
MUCH HAPPIER SOMEWHERE ELSE--

591
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:12,805
>> I WOULD.

592
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:13,673
>> THEN LEAVE.

593
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:15,175
>> I WILL.

594
00:16:15,175 --> 00:16:16,243
>> YOU'RE GONNA BE DOWN THERE

595
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:17,310
SPENDING ALL YOUR [bleep] MONEY.

596
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,311
>> NO, I WON'T.

597
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,379
>> BULL[bleep].

598
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:20,480
THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T EVEN SHARE

599
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,214
MONEY UP HERE.

600
00:16:21,214 --> 00:16:22,215
WHY WOULD IT BE ANY DIFFERENT

601
00:16:22,215 --> 00:16:23,250
WHEN I--ESPECIALLY WHEN I--

602
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,951
>> A PAYCHECK IS 150 BUCKS.

603
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,053
>> YEAH, AND YOU WASTE ALL YOUR

604
00:16:26,053 --> 00:16:26,986
MONEY, BLAKE.

605
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,421
THE ONLY MONEY THAT YOU SPEND

606
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:29,522
LOGICALLY IS THE MONEY THAT I'M

607
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:30,623
LIKE, "YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T DO

608
00:16:30,623 --> 00:16:31,658
THAT."

609
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,093
>> AND DOWN THERE I'LL BE

610
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:34,227
MAKING, LIKE, $1,000, SO I'LL

611
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:35,362
HAVE MONEY TO SAVE.

612
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:36,429
>> AND THAT'S A LOT MORE MONEY

613
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:37,564
TO GO BLOW FOR YOU.

614
00:16:37,564 --> 00:16:38,565
>> OKAY, I WILL.

615
00:16:38,565 --> 00:16:39,532
I'LL DO WHATEVER I WANT TO

616
00:16:39,532 --> 00:16:40,167
WITH IT.

617
00:16:40,167 --> 00:16:41,268
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU DO WITH YOUR

618
00:16:41,268 --> 00:16:42,001
MONEY ANYWAYS.

619
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:42,735
>> OKAY, THEN.

620
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:43,470
IT'S MY MONEY.

621
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,237
I WORKED FOR IT.

622
00:16:44,237 --> 00:16:45,538
IT'S MINE.

623
00:16:45,538 --> 00:16:46,573
>> THAT'S NOT HOW IT SHOULD BE

624
00:16:46,573 --> 00:16:47,807
IF YOU WANT TO BE WITH SOMEBODY.

625
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:48,875
>> OKAY.

626
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:49,909
WELL, I GUESS I DON'T WANT TO BE

627
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:51,644
WITH YOU.

628
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,489
>> AFTER DRIVING AROUND ARGUING

629
00:17:02,489 --> 00:17:04,691
FOR A WHILE, I TEXTED MY MOM

630
00:17:04,691 --> 00:17:05,758
ABOUT BLAKE THREATENING TO

631
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:06,426
LEAVE.

632
00:17:06,426 --> 00:17:07,960
I FIGURED SHE'D BE PRETTY PISSED

633
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,930
BY THE TIME WE GOT HOME.

634
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,265
ALL I'M ASKING YOU TO DO IS

635
00:17:12,265 --> 00:17:14,201
SOMETHING FOR YOUR KID.

636
00:17:15,535 --> 00:17:16,903
>> OKAY, WHATEVER.

637
00:17:16,903 --> 00:17:18,771
THAT'S WHAT YOU ALWAYS SAY.

638
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:23,276
>> WHAT?

639
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:24,277
I KNOW YOU DIDN'T JUST CALL ME

640
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:25,312
A BITCH.

641
00:17:25,312 --> 00:17:26,313
>> WHY DID YOU CALL HER THAT?

642
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:26,979
WHY?

643
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:27,814
>> 'CAUSE.

644
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:28,781
>> I WANT TO KNOW WHY.

645
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:29,649
I DON'T APPRECIATE YOU

646
00:17:29,649 --> 00:17:30,683
DISRESPECTING MY DAUGHTER

647
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:31,318
LIKE THAT.

648
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:32,652
>> YOU, LIKE, MUMBLED IT.

649
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:33,753
IF YOU'RE GONNA SAY IT, SAY IT

650
00:17:33,753 --> 00:17:35,655
SO SOMEBODY CAN HEAR YOU.

651
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:38,458
>> YEAH, I STILL HEARD YOU.

652
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,194
>> WHAT DID SHE DO, BLAKE?

653
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:42,195
>> WILL YOU STOP?

654
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:43,396
>> NO, I WON'T.

655
00:17:43,396 --> 00:17:44,564
>> OH, GOD, YOU'RE [bleep]

656
00:17:44,564 --> 00:17:45,298
CRAZY.

657
00:17:45,298 --> 00:17:46,499
>> NO, I'M NOT.

658
00:17:46,499 --> 00:17:48,034
BECAUSE I LOVE MY DAUGHTER?

659
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:48,701
>> OKAY.

660
00:17:48,701 --> 00:17:49,702
>> BECAUSE I DON'T APPRECIATE

661
00:17:49,702 --> 00:17:50,737
YOU DISRESPECTING HER LIKE THAT?

662
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:52,639
>> OKAY, STOP.

663
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:53,640
I'M TRYING TO TALK TO HER,

664
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,741
NOT YOU.

665
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:55,742
I AIN'T GOT NOTHING TO SAY TO

666
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:56,776
YOU.

667
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,411
I NEVER DO.

668
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,346
I DON'T EVEN LIKE TALKING

669
00:17:59,346 --> 00:17:59,946
TO YOU.

670
00:17:59,946 --> 00:18:00,947
>> I DON'T HAVE NOTHING TO SAY

671
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:01,681
TO YOU EITHER.

672
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:02,682
>> THEN WHY ARE YOU TALKING

673
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:03,250
TO ME?

674
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,351
>> YOU DON'T THINK ABOUT MONEY.

675
00:18:04,351 --> 00:18:05,385
YOU GO BLOW [bleep] WHEN YOU GOT

676
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:06,119
A BABY COMING--

677
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:06,853
>> NO, I DON'T.

678
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:07,587
>> BULL[bleep].

679
00:18:07,587 --> 00:18:08,321
YOU CAN LEAVE.

680
00:18:08,321 --> 00:18:10,190
>> OKAY.

681
00:18:16,796 --> 00:18:17,864
>> BLAKE DIDN'T COME HOME THAT

682
00:18:17,864 --> 00:18:18,831
NIGHT.

683
00:18:18,831 --> 00:18:19,832
HE TEXTED AND SAID HE WAS

684
00:18:19,832 --> 00:18:22,735
STAYING AT HIS FRIEND'S HOUSE.

685
00:18:22,735 --> 00:18:24,137
SINCE HE WASN'T AROUND THE NEXT

686
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:26,239
DAY, MY MOM HAD TO GO PICK UP

687
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:27,740
THE CRIB FROM MY AUNT.

688
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,875
IT SUCKS NOT HAVING BLAKE'S

689
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:29,609
HELP.

690
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,344
HE CAN'T KEEP LETTING ME AND HIS

691
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:33,213
DAUGHTER DOWN.

692
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:39,719
LIKE, I DON'T THINK PUTTING HER

693
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,421
FIRST HAS HIT HIM YET.

694
00:18:41,421 --> 00:18:43,055
>> WOULD YOU BE SAD IF HE LEFT?

695
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:44,023
>> I'D BE REALLY HURT IF HE

696
00:18:44,023 --> 00:18:46,125
LEFT, LIKE, BECAUSE WE HAVE SO

697
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,059
MUCH HISTORY.

698
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:48,795
BUT I WOULD BE MORE UPSET THAT

699
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:50,397
HE WASN'T THERE TO, LIKE, SEE

700
00:18:50,397 --> 00:18:51,598
TINLEIGH WHEN SHE TOOK HER FIRST

701
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:53,266
BREATH, THAN I WOULD BE THAT HE

702
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:54,334
WASN'T THERE WHEN I WAS IN A TON

703
00:18:54,334 --> 00:18:55,968
OF PAIN, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

704
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,470
MY DAD WAS NEVER THERE FOR ME.

705
00:18:57,470 --> 00:18:58,438
LIKE, ME AND MY DAD NEVER

706
00:18:58,438 --> 00:18:59,672
TALKED; LIKE, WE NEVER HAD

707
00:18:59,672 --> 00:19:00,873
A RELATIONSHIP.

708
00:19:00,873 --> 00:19:02,775
LIKE, I WANT TINLEIGH TO HAVE

709
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:04,611
A DAD AND TO HAVE--LIKE, TO BE

710
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:06,779
A DADDY'S GIRL, JUST BECAUSE

711
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:11,418
I NEVER HAD THAT.

712
00:19:11,418 --> 00:19:12,719
I DON'T LIKE THE WAY BLAKE HAS

713
00:19:12,719 --> 00:19:14,053
BEEN TREATING ME LATELY.

714
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:15,322
BUT AFTER NOT HEARING FROM HIM

715
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:16,823
ALL DAY, I WAS WORRIED HE MIGHT

716
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:19,058
NOT BE COMING BACK AT ALL.

717
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:32,905
>> YOU'RE SUCH AN ASS.

718
00:19:36,075 --> 00:19:36,909
>> BECAUSE YOU'RE

719
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:39,078
AN ASS[bleep].

720
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:40,947
YEAH.

721
00:19:42,081 --> 00:19:42,849
>> I DON'T CARE.

722
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:43,783
THAT'S JUST GONNA MAKE ME

723
00:19:43,783 --> 00:19:44,384
FATTER.

724
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:46,386
>> I'M SORRY.

725
00:19:46,386 --> 00:19:47,554
>> WELL, DANG, SHOULD WE REALLY

726
00:19:47,554 --> 00:19:48,621
BE TOGETHER IF WE'RE REALLY

727
00:19:48,621 --> 00:19:50,757
GONNA BITCH AND MOAN AND GROAN

728
00:19:50,757 --> 00:19:52,659
ALL THE TIME?

729
00:19:52,659 --> 00:19:55,127
>> I'M SORRY.

730
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,429
>> I'M WILLING TO KEEP TRYING

731
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:58,365
TO MAKE IT WORK, BUT BLAKE NEEDS

732
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:01,268
TO START TREATING ME BETTER.

733
00:20:01,268 --> 00:20:02,269
SO I WAS HAPPY THAT BLAKE

734
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:03,336
SUGGESTED WE GET OUT OF THE

735
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:04,371
HOUSE FOR A CHANGE AND SPEND

736
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:06,606
SOME TIME TOGETHER.

737
00:20:06,606 --> 00:20:07,740
>> READY FOR THIS?

738
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:10,076
>> YEAH.

739
00:20:10,076 --> 00:20:10,977
>> ALL RIGHT, ON THREE.

740
00:20:10,977 --> 00:20:13,646
ONE, TWO, THREE.

741
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,482
[whistle toots]

742
00:20:15,482 --> 00:20:17,817
>> OOH, I'M A LITTLE NERVOUS.

743
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:18,818
>> ARE YOU, BABY?

744
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:19,686
>> YEAH, ARE YOU GONNA

745
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:20,387

>> YOU CAN'T JUST BE A TEENAGER

1299
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:00,812
LIKE YOU USED TO.

1300
00:38:05,451 --> 00:38:06,952
>> [exhales]

1301
00:38:06,952 --> 00:38:09,388
>> YEAH, IT'S HARD.

1302
00:38:09,388 --> 00:38:10,522
>> I WISH I WOULD HAVE WAITED TO

1303
00:38:10,522 --> 00:38:14,159
HAVE A BABY.

1304
00:38:14,159 --> 00:38:16,127
>> EVERYBODY IN LIFE, YOU KNOW,

1305
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,563
LOOKS BACK AND SAYS, "I WISH I

1306
00:38:17,563 --> 00:38:19,398
HAD DONE THIS DIFFERENTLY."

1307
00:38:19,398 --> 00:38:20,732
I'M RIGHT THERE WITH YOU.

1308
00:38:20,732 --> 00:38:22,067
I WISH, YOU KNOW--I WISH YOU HAD

1309

WAITED, BUT OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE

1310
00:38:25,036 --> 00:38:26,672
TINLEIGH NOW, AND THINGS ARE

1311
00:38:26,672 --> 00:38:29,107
GONNA BE HARDER, AND YOU JUST

1312
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:30,942
HAVE TO MAKE THE MOST OF IT.

1313
00:38:36,114 --> 00:38:37,148
>> IT MAKES ME REALLY SAD TO

1314
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,484
THINK THAT TINLEIGH'S GONNA GROW

1315
00:38:38,484 --> 00:38:40,752
UP WITHOUT HER DAD.

1316
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:43,088
I AM PISSED OFF, LIKE, THAT

1317
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:45,290
BLAKE JUST LEFT.

1318
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:47,158
AND IT DOES HURT.

1319
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,627
LIKE, HE HELPED CREATE TINLEIGH,

1320
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:50,195
AND NOW I'M TAKING CARE OF

1321
00:38:50,195 --> 00:38:52,263
SOMETHING THAT'S HALF HIS

1322
00:38:52,263 --> 00:38:53,331
RESPONSIBILITY.

1323
00:38:53,331 --> 00:38:55,967
[baby crying]

1324
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:57,603
HEY.

1325
00:38:57,603 --> 00:38:59,270
I DIDN'T WANT A BABY AT 17

1326
00:38:59,270 --> 00:39:01,440
BECAUSE THERE WERE THINGS I

1327
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:02,974
WANTED TO DO IN LIFE THAT YOU--

1328
00:39:02,974 --> 00:39:05,744
THAT ARE A LOT, A LOT, A LOT

1329
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:07,145
HARDER WITH A BABY.

1330
00:39:07,145 --> 00:39:08,647
LIKE, I WANTED TO BE

1331
00:39:08,647 --> 00:39:09,448
A JOURNALIST.

1332
00:39:09,448 --> 00:39:10,782
THAT'S A CAREER YOU HAVE TO PUT

1333
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:11,517
WORK INTO.

1334
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:12,851
AND WITH A BABY, THERE'S JUST

1335
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:13,985
NOT ENOUGH TIME TO PUT INTO

1336
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:17,188
BOTH.

1337
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,390
>> THERE'S MOMMY.

1338
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:19,625
HI, MAMA.

1339
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:21,126
SAY, "I MISSED YOU."

1340
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:22,360
SO HOW WAS SCHOOL?

1341
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,629
>> I HAVE SO MUCH HOMEWORK

1342
00:39:23,629 --> 00:39:24,329
TONIGHT.

1343
00:39:24,329 --> 00:39:25,163
>> AW.

1344
00:39:25,163 --> 00:39:26,297
>> I DON'T FEEL LIKE A TEENAGER

1345
00:39:26,297 --> 00:39:28,500
ANYMORE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO GIVE

1346
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:30,001
THINGS UP.

1347
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:32,571
AND IT'S NOT FAIR.

1348
00:39:32,571 --> 00:39:34,272
MY FRIENDS ARE GONNA GO AWAY TO

1349
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:36,775
COLLEGE AND GO ON SPRING BREAK

1350
00:39:36,775 --> 00:39:37,676
WITH ALL THEIR FRIENDS.

1351
00:39:37,676 --> 00:39:38,944
LIKE, NOW I CAN'T GO AWAY TO

1352
00:39:38,944 --> 00:39:39,711
SCHOOL.

1353
00:39:39,711 --> 00:39:41,913
I CAN'T DO THOSE THINGS.

1354
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:44,683
I FEEL LIKE BY MAKING ONE STUPID

1355
00:39:44,683 --> 00:39:46,418
DECISION, I KIND OF TOOK THAT

1356
00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:47,318
AWAY FROM MYSELF.

1357
00:39:47,318 --> 00:39:49,020
[baby crying]

1358
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:50,689
SHH.

1359
00:39:50,689 --> 00:39:51,890
ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GONNA EAT REAL

1360
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,492
QUICK, OKAY, 'CAUSE IF MOMMY

1361
00:39:53,492 --> 00:39:54,593
DOESN'T EAT, TINLEIGH DOESN'T

1362
00:39:54,593 --> 00:39:55,694
EAT.

1363
00:39:55,694 --> 00:39:57,429
SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH.

1364
00:39:57,429 --> 00:40:00,031
[baby crying]

1365
00:40:00,031 --> 00:40:01,567
BEING A MOM IS A LOT OF WORK,

1366
00:40:01,567 --> 00:40:03,068
AND SOMETIMES YOU'RE JUST KIND

1367
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:04,636
OF GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS

1368
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:06,004
'CAUSE YOU GET NO SLEEP.

1369
00:40:06,004 --> 00:40:07,038
THAT'S NOT FUN.

1370
00:40:07,038 --> 00:40:08,574
AND I LOVE TINLEIGH TO DEATH,

1371
00:40:08,574 --> 00:40:10,275
BUT SOMETIMES SHE DRIVES ME

1372
00:40:10,275 --> 00:40:11,076
CRAZY.

1373
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:12,711
YOU ARE GROSS.

1374
00:40:12,711 --> 00:40:14,379
GIVE ME YOUR HAND.

1375
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:15,046
UGH.

1376
00:40:15,046 --> 00:40:16,114
[baby crying]

1377
00:40:16,114 --> 00:40:17,516
IF I HAD KNOWN HAVING A BABY WAS

1378
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:20,318
GONNA BE SO HARD, THEN I WOULD

1379
00:40:20,318 --> 00:40:22,053
HAVE DONE EVERYTHING I COULD TO

1380
00:40:22,053 --> 00:40:22,721
PREVENT IT.

1381
00:40:22,721 --> 00:40:24,523
I WOULD HAVE NEVER HAD SEX.

1382
00:40:24,523 --> 00:40:25,524
THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE BEST

1383
00:40:25,524 --> 00:40:27,225
THING TO PREVENT IT.

1384
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:28,660
I DO FEEL LIKE A SINGLE MOM

1385
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,697
BECAUSE BLAKE'S NOT HERE.

1386
00:40:31,697 --> 00:40:33,932
BLAKE'S NOT HELPING ME AT ALL.

1387
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:35,100
BLAKE'S NOT GETTING UP IN THE

1388
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,502
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT OR FIXING

1389
00:40:36,502 --> 00:40:39,204
BOTTLES OR CHANGING DIAPERS.

1390
00:40:39,204 --> 00:40:42,841
AND THAT WOULD MAKE ME

1391
00:40:42,841 --> 00:40:44,776
A SINGLE MOM.

1392
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:01,560
>> DID HE KNOW THAT THAT WAS

1393
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,194
YOUR FIRST TIME?

1394
00:41:03,194 --> 00:41:04,896
>> HE DIDN'T HAVE A CONDOM.

1395
00:41:04,896 --> 00:41:05,897
HE WAS LIKE, "OH, I'LL JUST

1396
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:07,599
PULL OUT."

1397
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,700
>> BIG BOY.

1398
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,101
>> NOBODY HANGS OUT WITH ME

1399
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:11,336
ANYMORE BECAUSE THEY'D RATHER GO

1400
00:41:11,336 --> 00:41:11,970
PARTY.

1401
00:41:11,970 --> 00:41:13,204
WHAT ARE WE DOING THIS WEEKEND?

1402
00:41:13,204 --> 00:41:14,205
>> PROBABLY GONNA GO TO HOUSE

1403
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:14,940
PARTIES.

1404
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:15,874
>> I FEEL LIKE IT'S GETTING

1405
00:41:15,874 --> 00:41:17,543
RUBBED IN MY FACE.
