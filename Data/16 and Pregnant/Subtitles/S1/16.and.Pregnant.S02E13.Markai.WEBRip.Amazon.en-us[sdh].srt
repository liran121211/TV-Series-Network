00:00:04,538 --> 00:00:06,307
>> [laughs]

2
00:00:06,307 --> 00:00:07,041
DO WE NEED THOSE LITTLE

3
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:08,042
BUMPER THINGS?

4
00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:09,210
'CAUSE Y'ALL KNOW I CAN'T BOWL.

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,711
MY NAME IS MARKAI.

6
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:12,413
I'M 16 YEARS OLD, AND I LIVE

7
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:13,781
IN FLORIDA.

8
00:00:13,781 --> 00:00:14,615
YOU WANT CREDIT OR DEBIT?

9
00:00:14,615 --> 00:00:16,150
I'M A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL,

10
00:00:16,150 --> 00:00:17,118
AND I'M WORKING PART-TIME

11
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:18,952
AT A GROCERY STORE, BUT I HAVE

12
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,054
BIGGER PLANS.

13
00:00:20,054 --> 00:00:22,256
EVER SINCE I WAS A LITTLE GIRL,

14
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:24,225
I WANTED TO BE A VETERINARIAN,

15
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:25,626
AND I'M LUCKY, BECAUSE MY SCHOOL

16
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:27,061
HAS COURSES THAT FAST-TRACK ME

17
00:00:27,061 --> 00:00:28,028
TO VET SCHOOL.

18
00:00:28,028 --> 00:00:29,363
MY MOM, SARINA, RAISED ME

19
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,332
ON HER OWN.

20
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:35,469
>> I NEVER HAD ANY REGULAR

21
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:37,071
CONTACT WITH MY DAD, WHICH IS

22
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:38,472
OKAY WITH ME NOW BECAUSE I HAVE

23
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:40,408
A STRONG MAN IN MY LIFE.

24
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:42,410
I MET JAMES AT A FOOTBALL GAME,

25
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,611
AND WHEN I FELL FOR HIM,

26
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:44,945
NOBODY WAS MORE SURPRISED THAN

27
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:47,181
ME, BECAUSE HE'S NOT MY TYPE.

28
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:49,150
BUT HE ENDED UP WINNING ME OVER.

29
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,484
YOU'RE WHITE WITH DREADS.

30
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:51,319
THAT'S THE WEIRDEST THING

31
00:00:51,319 --> 00:00:52,153
I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.

32
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:53,254
>> HOW IS THAT WEIRD?

33
00:00:53,254 --> 00:00:54,922
[laughter]

34
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:56,590
>> HAVING A SINGLE MOM LEFT ME

35
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:58,592
WITH A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITIES

36
00:00:58,592 --> 00:00:59,760
FOR RAISING MY LITTLE SISTER,

37
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:00,928
SAMARRA.

38
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:01,929
IT'S A GOOD THING THAT I GOT

39
00:01:01,929 --> 00:01:03,597
A LOT OF PRACTICE RAISING A KID

40
00:01:03,597 --> 00:01:06,434
BECAUSE I'M PREGNANT.

41
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:08,369
[chime dings]

42
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,318
>> THIS THAT TURKEY BACON?

43
00:01:24,318 --> 00:01:24,985
>> YES.

44
00:01:24,985 --> 00:01:26,154
>> WHAT'S UP WITH Y'ALL?

45
00:01:26,154 --> 00:01:26,987
WHY Y'ALL DO THAT?

46
00:01:26,987 --> 00:01:28,322
>> WE ALMOST ATE WITHOUT

47
00:01:28,322 --> 00:01:29,357
YOU GUYS.

48
00:01:29,357 --> 00:01:30,358
>> THAT'S MESSED UP.

49
00:01:30,358 --> 00:01:31,692
>> ONE THING ABOUT MY MOM,

50
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:33,194
SHE'S NOT SHY ABOUT SAYING

51
00:01:33,194 --> 00:01:34,428
WHAT'S ON HER MIND.

52
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:35,429
>> I JUST--MY QUESTION TO YOU

53
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:38,332
GUYS IS, WERE YOU PRACTICING

54
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:39,367
SAFE SEX?

55
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:40,067
>> NO.

56
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:40,834
>> NAH.

57
00:01:40,834 --> 00:01:41,835
>> WE WEREN'T.

58
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:42,703
>> WHY?

59
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,605
>> WELL...[mumbles]

60
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:47,341
CONDOMS BE ALL IN THE WAY,

61
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:48,609
PRETTY MUCH.

62
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,843
>> CONDOMS IN THE WAY...

63
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:50,944
OKAY.

64
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,580
WELL, I KNOW I WENT AND BOUGHT

65
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:54,248
BANANAS FOR MY KIDS AND TAUGHT

66
00:01:54,248 --> 00:01:56,083
THEM HOW TO PUT CONDOMS ON

67
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:57,751
THEMSELVES AND NOT TO LET

68
00:01:57,751 --> 00:01:59,853
THE BOYS PUT IT ON.

69
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:00,688
AND IF THEY COULDN'T WEAR

70
00:02:00,688 --> 00:02:02,356
A CONDOM, THAT MEANT WHAT?

71
00:02:02,356 --> 00:02:03,357
>> THEY COULDN'T HAVE SEX.

72
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:05,058
CROSS YOUR LEGS.

73
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:05,893
>> I ASKED YOU GUYS WHAT YOU

74
00:02:05,893 --> 00:02:07,728
WERE GONNA DO, AND, YOU KNOW,

75
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:09,897
I'M PRO-CHOICE, SO...

76
00:02:09,897 --> 00:02:10,898
>> JAMES ANSWERED BEFORE

77
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:11,732
I COULD.

78
00:02:11,732 --> 00:02:12,400
>> YEAH.

79
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,301
>> both: "I'M GONNA TAKE CARE

80
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:13,867
OF MINE."

81
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:14,702
>> YEAH, THAT.

82
00:02:14,702 --> 00:02:16,837
THE FAMOUS LAST WORDS.

83
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:17,671
>> MY MOM CAN'T HIDE HER

84
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:18,672
FEELINGS.

85
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:20,174
SHE DOESN'T HAVE HIGH HOPES

86
00:02:20,174 --> 00:02:22,142
FOR JAMES AND I AS A COUPLE.

87
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:23,143
SHE'S SCARED I'LL FOLLOW

88
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,645
IN HER FOOTSTEPS.

89
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:25,813
MY MOM SUPPORTED MY DAD,

90
00:02:25,813 --> 00:02:27,315
AND THEN HE TOOK OFF WHEN

91
00:02:27,315 --> 00:02:29,317
THE TIME CAME TO RAISE US.

92
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:30,818
SHE'S BEEN REALLY STRICT

93
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:31,819
ABOUT NOT LETTING JAMES

94
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:33,153
STAY AT THE HOUSE.

95
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,588
HE DOESN'T HAVE A JOB,

96
00:02:34,588 --> 00:02:35,756
SO HE CAN'T GET US A PLACE

97
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:39,693
TO LIVE WHEN THE BABY COMES.

98
00:02:39,693 --> 00:02:41,195
>> WE GONNA DO OUR VERY BEST

99
00:02:41,195 --> 00:02:42,563
TO TAKE CARE OF HER, WHETHER

100
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:44,398
SHE HAS ALL THE GOLD AND JEWELS

101
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:46,534
IN THE WORLD OR WHETHER SHE HAS

102
00:02:46,534 --> 00:02:47,535
A ROOF OVER HER HEAD

103
00:02:47,535 --> 00:02:49,370
AND FOOD IN HER MOUTH.

104
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,305
SHE GOT US.

105
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:01,615
>> IT'S NOT FUNNY.

106
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:02,550
YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST DAY

107
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:04,051
WE SEEN EACH OTHER?

108
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:05,286
>> I WILL NEVER FORGET IT.

109
00:03:05,286 --> 00:03:06,720
YOU SEE ME, AND YOU SEE

110
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,055
THAT I WAS ALREADY CUTE.

111
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:09,290
>> YOU WAS ALL RIGHT.

112
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,991
>> WHATEVER.

113
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,926
I WAS NASTY.

114
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:13,761
>> HMM?

115
00:03:13,761 --> 00:03:14,662
>> I MEAN, JUST PARTYING

116
00:03:14,662 --> 00:03:16,630
AND NOT CARING AND...

117
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,731
>> NOW IT'S JUST ME AND YOU.

118
00:03:17,731 --> 00:03:18,399
>> I KNOW.

119
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:20,301
WE MATURED A LOT.

120
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:21,435
'CAUSE...

121
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:22,936
>> NOW WE GOT A BABY.

122
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:23,937
>> I JUST WANT HER TO HAVE

123
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:24,772
A GOOD LIFE.

124
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:27,475
YOU KNOW, SHE CAN KNOW

125
00:03:27,475 --> 00:03:28,309
THAT HER PARENTS ARE ALWAYS

126
00:03:28,309 --> 00:03:30,478
GONNA BE THERE, BOTH PARENTS.

127
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:31,312
>> WELL, LIKE I SAID,

128
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:33,146
LIKE, IF YOU GO INTO SOMETHING

129
00:03:33,146 --> 00:03:34,315
WITH FEAR IN YOUR HEART OR

130
00:03:34,315 --> 00:03:35,649
WHATEVER, YOU AIN'T GONNA DO

131
00:03:35,649 --> 00:03:36,484
NOTHING BUT PANIC.

132
00:03:36,484 --> 00:03:37,351
IT'S JUST GONNA MAKE THINGS

133
00:03:37,351 --> 00:03:37,985
WORSE.

134
00:03:37,985 --> 00:03:38,986
BUT IF YOU GO INTO IT THINKING

135
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:42,423
ON THE POSITIVE SIDE, YOU RIGHT.

136
00:03:42,423 --> 00:03:43,757
>> LIKE, US BREAKING UP

137
00:03:43,757 --> 00:03:44,858
IS NEVER AN OPTION.

138
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:46,193
>> MM-HMM.

139
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:48,028
>> OH, BABY, IT'S A SPIDER.

140
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:48,729
THAT'S A SPIDER.

141
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:49,430
THAT'S A SPIDER.

142
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:50,097
>> WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

00:03:50,097 --> 00:03:50,731
>> IN YOUR HAIR.

144
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:51,399
YOU SEE IT?

145
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:52,232
>> WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!

146
00:03:52,232 --> 00:03:53,233
Y'ALL TRYING TO GET ME KILLED

147
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,168
OUT HERE.

148
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,441
>> MY SENIOR YEAR IS JUST

150
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:03,577
MY BABY IS DUE IN NINE WEEKS,

151
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,412
SO I HAD TO TAKE A LEAVE FROM

152
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:06,280
MY JOB, AND I DON'T HAVE A PLAN

153
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:08,416
YET FOR WHEN THE BABY COMES.

154
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,418
ALL I KNOW IS, THERE IS NO WAY

155
00:04:10,418 --> 00:04:11,585
I'M GONNA BE A HIGH SCHOOL

156
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:12,920
DROPOUT, AS AN EXAMPLE

157
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,088
FOR MY BABY.

[doorbell rings]

159
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,093
>> HEY.

160
00:04:20,093 --> 00:04:22,763
>> HI.

161
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,097
>> HOW YOU BEEN?

162
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,433
I BROUGHT YOU SOME CUPCAKES.

163
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:26,300
>> OH.

00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,301
WE'RE HAVING A GIRL,

165
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:28,936

167
00:04:30,304 --> 00:04:32,606
AGREED TO BE THE GODMOTHER.

HOPES AND DREAMS, NOT KNOWING

177
00:04:48,622 --> 00:04:50,658
THAT ONCE UPON A QUIET TIME

178
00:04:50,658 --> 00:04:51,659
YOU CLOSED YOUR EYES AND DREAMED

179
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,661
TO HAVE HER IN YOUR LIFE."

IT REALLY WARMS MY HEART

00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:59,166
THAT MY FRIENDS ARE BY MY SIDE.

183
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:01,168
BUT IT WAS HAVING A TOTALLY

184
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:02,836
DIFFERENT EFFECT ON MY MOM.

185
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:04,171
>> MY HEART IS BROKEN.

186
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:05,005
YOU HAVE BROKE MY HEART.

187

HOW MANY--I MEAN, I MIGHT NOT

188
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,675
SAY IT EVERY DAY, "OH, MY HEART

189
00:05:07,675 --> 00:05:08,642
IS BROKEN."

190
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:09,810
YOU'VE KNOWN FROM DAY ONE, WHEN

191
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,479
I ASKED YOU IN THAT HOSPITAL,

192
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:13,013
WHAT YOU WERE GONNA DO.

193
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:14,682
ALL I REMEMBER FROM JAMES IS,

194
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:16,417
"I'M GONNA TAKE CARE OF MINE.

195
00:05:16,417 --> 00:05:17,284
IF IT'S MINE, I'M GONNA

196
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:18,285
TAKE CARE OF MINE."

197
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:19,387
AND ALL I HEARD FROM YOU WAS,

198
00:05:19,387 --> 00:05:21,355
"WE DECIDED TO KEEP THIS BABY.

199
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:22,990
WE'RE GONNA RAISE THIS BABY."

200
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,024
>> WHY ONE MINUTE DO YOU BELIEVE

201
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:25,092
IN US AND THE NEXT MINUTE

202
00:05:25,092 --> 00:05:26,326
YOU DON'T?

203
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,628
>> I WANT YOU TO SUCCEED.

204
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:29,597
I WANT YOU TO BE SUCCESSFUL.

205
00:05:29,597 --> 00:05:30,898
BUT JUST LIKE YOU READ THAT CARD

206
00:05:30,898 --> 00:05:32,566
CASSIDY BROUGHT YOU ABOUT

207
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:33,901
THE DREAMS FOR YOUR CHILD

208
00:05:33,901 --> 00:05:35,469
AND THE STUFF SHE GONNA DO,

209
00:05:35,469 --> 00:05:36,637
ALL I COULD THINK WAS,

210
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:39,607
"I HAD THOSE SAME DREAMS."

211
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:41,609
AND I JUST HOPE YOUR BABY

212
00:05:41,609 --> 00:05:43,444
IS NOT PREGNANT AT 16.

213
00:05:43,444 --> 00:05:44,612
WHAT YOU THINK, WHEN I LOOKED

214
00:05:44,612 --> 00:05:46,313
AT YOU OR FELT YOU MOVE IN MY

215
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:48,115
STOMACH, IT WAS, "HMM,

216
00:05:48,115 --> 00:05:49,617
I WANT HER TO BE PREGNANT

217
00:05:49,617 --> 00:05:51,619
AT 16, HER SENIOR YEAR

218
00:05:51,619 --> 00:05:53,787
OF HIGH SCHOOL, NO JOB,

219
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:55,989
NO PLACE TO LIVE"?

220
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:56,824
THAT WAS NOT MY DREAM

221
00:05:56,824 --> 00:05:58,325
FOR MY CHILD.

222
00:05:58,325 --> 00:05:59,993
HOW MUCH HAVE Y'ALL SAVED UP?

223
00:05:59,993 --> 00:06:00,661
>> NOTHING, MOM.

224
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:01,662
>> JAMES BOUGHT HIS FIRST PAIR

225
00:06:01,662 --> 00:06:03,597
OF DIAPERS TWO WEEKS AGO.

226
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:04,432
AND THE ONLY REASON I THINK

227
00:06:04,432 --> 00:06:06,400
YOU DID THAT IS BECAUSE I SAID,

228
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,735
"DON'T HAVE THAT BOY COME IN

229
00:06:07,735 --> 00:06:09,403
THIS HOUSE WITH--EMPTY-HANDED.

230
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:10,738
NOT ANOTHER DAY, BECAUSE THE

231
00:06:10,738 --> 00:06:12,906
SIGHT OF HIM IS DISGUSTING ME."

232
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:13,907
DID I NOT TELL YOU THAT?

233
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:14,875
I MIGHT NOT HAVE TOLD YOU THAT.

234
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:15,843
>> NO, YOU AIN'T NEED TO TELL ME

235
00:06:15,843 --> 00:06:16,376
THAT.

236
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,145
>> BUT I TOLD HER THAT.

237
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:19,513
I MEAN, I KNOW YOU THERE.

238
00:06:19,513 --> 00:06:20,514
BUT WHAT I'VE ALWAYS TAUGHT

239
00:06:20,514 --> 00:06:22,516
MY DAUGHTER, AND I KNOW I'VE

240
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:24,017
SHOWED THEM BY EXAMPLE, LIKE,

241
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:28,021
YOU CAN'T DEPEND ON BABY DADDY.

242
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:29,356
I DON'T KNOW.

243
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:30,858
YOU CAN'T RELY ON ANYBODY

244
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:33,193
BUT YOU.

245
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,528
AND I'M NOT TRYING TO HURT

246
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:35,463
YOUR FEELINGS.

247
00:06:35,463 --> 00:06:37,297
I WANT YOU TO SUCCEED.

248
00:06:37,297 --> 00:06:39,299
YOU USED TO IT.

249
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:40,133
>> I'M USED TO IT.

250
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:40,968
>> WELL, I'M USED TO YOU

251
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:41,835
BREAKING MY HEART, AND I'M

252
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:42,836
TIRED OF THAT.

253
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,772
>> OKAY.

254
00:06:56,817 --> 00:06:58,251
>> LAST NIGHT, MY MOM REALLY

255
00:06:58,251 --> 00:07:00,220
LET LOOSE WITH HER FEELINGS,

256
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,655
BUT I KNOW SHE'S JUST LOOKING

257
00:07:01,655 --> 00:07:02,856
OUT FOR ME.

258
00:07:02,856 --> 00:07:04,492
SHE WAS A YOUNG MOTHER,

259
00:07:04,492 --> 00:07:05,659
AND IF ANYBODY KNOWS WHAT

260
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:07,327
IT'S LIKE TO BE IN MY POSITION,

261
00:07:07,327 --> 00:07:08,161
IT'S HER.

262
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,663
>> MARKAI?

263
00:07:09,663 --> 00:07:10,498
I DON'T WANT YOU ALWAYS

264
00:07:10,498 --> 00:07:12,399
HAVE TO LEARN THE HARD WAY.

265
00:07:12,399 --> 00:07:14,768
I WANT SOME THINGS YOU TO LEARN,

266
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,004
YOU KNOW, THROUGH ME, FROM ME.

267
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:18,105
BECAUSE I WENT THROUGH SCHOOL

268
00:07:18,105 --> 00:07:20,708
WITH TWO KIDS, AND IT WASN'T

269
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:22,476
EASY, AND I FEEL IT MADE

270
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:24,645
MY OLDEST GROW UP FASTER

271
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:26,847
THAN SHE REALLY SHOULD HAVE.

272
00:07:26,847 --> 00:07:28,649
>> YEAH.

273
00:07:28,649 --> 00:07:29,750
>> BUT I DON'T WANT YOU TO EVER

274
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,519
THINK I DOUBT YOU.

275
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:33,453
I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA MAKE IT.

276
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,488
SO THE STUFF THAT I'VE ALWAYS

277
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:36,857
TOLD YOU IS STILL THERE.

278
00:07:36,857 --> 00:07:37,691
IT'S JUST HARDER FOR YOU,

279
00:07:37,691 --> 00:07:38,592
AND I DIDN'T WANT IT TO BE

280
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:40,460
HARDER FOR YOU.

281
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,397
THAT'S NOT WHAT I WANT.

282
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,333
THANKS.

283
00:07:49,503 --> 00:07:50,838
>> JAMES AND I AREN'T ALWAYS

GOING TO RAISE ZA'KARIA.

286

BUT WE DO KNOW HOW WE PLAN

287
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,610
TO FEED HER.

288
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,878
I WANT TO BREAST-FEED.

289
00:07:57,878 --> 00:07:59,412
I THINK IT'S THE BEST THING.

290
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:00,247
I KNOW YOU THINK IT'S

291
00:08:00,247 --> 00:08:01,281
THE BEST THING.

292
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,283
BREAST MILK TASTES SWEET TO ME.

>> IT'S NASTY.

296
00:08:06,654 --> 00:08:07,521
IT'S DISGUSTING.

297
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:08,355
>> JUST TASTE IT.

298
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:09,356
THAT'S ALL I WANT Y'ALL TO DO.

299
00:08:09,356 --> 00:08:10,090

00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:20,167
HAD SO MANY WEIRD SIDE EFFECTS.

307
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:23,070

I CAN'T SWALLOW IT WITHOUT

312
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:30,744
WANTING TO PUKE.

313
00:08:30,744 --> 00:08:31,645

>> YEAH, I DO EAT SOAP.

TO EAT SOAP.

318
00:08:38,185 --> 00:08:39,853

00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:23,891
ABOUT A MONTH AGO, MAYBE.

377
00:10:23,891 --> 00:10:24,725
I JUST WANTED TO COME IN,

378
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:25,392
CHECK ON IT AGAIN.

379
00:10:25,392 --> 00:10:26,393
>> OKAY, WELL, THE STORE MANAGER

380
00:10:26,393 --> 00:10:27,060
COMES IN AT 1:00.

381
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:28,061
IF YOU JUST LEAVE ME YOUR NAME

382
00:10:28,061 --> 00:10:29,062
AND PHONE NUMBER, WE WILL MAKE

383
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:29,897
SURE THAT WE LOOK IN TO IT.

384
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:30,698
>> OKAY, DO YOU HAVE A PEN

385
00:10:30,698 --> 00:10:31,531
OR PAPER OR SOMETHING?

386
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,867
>> SURE, YEAH, LET ME GET YOU...

387
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:36,536
[motor rattling]

388
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:37,370
>> WHAT IS UP...

389
00:10:37,370 --> 00:10:38,171
>> PUSH THE GAS.

390
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:40,507
>> I AM.

[engine whining]

392
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,150
THEY CAN'T SAY WE'RE NOT TRYING.

393
00:10:56,757 --> 00:10:57,758
JAMES STILL DOESN'T HAVE

394
00:10:57,758 --> 00:10:58,792
A JOB, AND NOW WE DON'T HAVE

395
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:00,127
A CAR EITHER.

396
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:02,095
THE BIGGEST THING IS, HE HASN'T

397
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:03,263
FOUND A PLACE FOR US TO STAY

398
00:11:03,263 --> 00:11:04,932
ONCE THE BABY COMES.

399
00:11:04,932 --> 00:11:06,666
WE STARTED MOVING HIS STUFF

400
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,101
INTO HERE, BUT MY MOM MIGHT NOT

401
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:10,037
BE CLEAR ON OUR PLAN.

402
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:32,692
>> WHEN IS JAMES MOVING IN?

403
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,194
>> MA, OH, MY GOODNESS.

404
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:36,263
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS.

405
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:46,273
>> I COULD HAVE SWORN I TALKED

406
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:47,274
TO YOU ABOUT IT.

407
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:49,209
>> NO, DON'T SWEAR.

408
00:11:55,983 --> 00:11:56,850
>> WHETHER I THINK IT'S FAIR

409
00:11:56,850 --> 00:11:58,318
OR NOT, IT'S HER HOUSE,

410
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:00,153
HER RULES.

411
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:02,655
ZA'KARIA'S HERE IN ONE MONTH.

412
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:03,824
AND IF JAMES DOESN'T GET THIS

413
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:05,492
SORTED OUT, HE'LL BE LOOKING IN

414
00:12:05,492 --> 00:12:07,427
FROM THE OUTSIDE.

415
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:23,710
>> ALL RIGHT, LOCKING THE FORT

416
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,446
DOWN.

00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:27,414
>> WITH THE BABY DUE IN FOUR

HARDER EVERY DAY.

420
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:40,393
I WANT TO BE A VETERINARIAN,

421
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:42,062
AND I WAS TAKING VET COURSES

422
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:43,730
AT MY SCHOOL, BUT BECAUSE

423
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,565
PREGNANT WOMEN CAN GET DANGEROUS

424
00:12:45,565 --> 00:12:47,234
GERMS AND PARASITES THAT ANIMALS

425
00:12:47,234 --> 00:12:49,236
CARRY, MY DOCTOR SAID I COULDN'T

426
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:50,904
BE AROUND THEM.

427
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:52,072
GETTING PREGNANT MEANS I'M GOING

428
00:12:52,072 --> 00:12:53,240
TO BE STUCK AT THE CHECKOUT

429
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,276
LONGER THAN I PLANNED.

430
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,010
>> HI, MARKAI.

431
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,278
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

432
00:12:58,278 --> 00:12:59,612
LONG TIME NO SEE.

433
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:00,447
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

434
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:01,781
>> I'M OKAY.

435
00:13:01,781 --> 00:13:03,183
SINCE I GOT PREGNANT,

436
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:04,184
A CASE WORKER HAS BEEN HELPING

437
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:06,353
ME MANAGE FINISHING SCHOOL,

438
00:13:06,353 --> 00:13:07,520
BUT WITH THE PRESSURE OF HAVING

439
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,856
TO FIND ME AND JAMES A PLACE

440
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:10,858
TO LIVE, SCHOOL IS THE LEAST

441
00:13:10,858 --> 00:13:12,025
OF MY PROBLEMS.

442
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:13,393
>> HOW IS IT GONNA--

443
00:13:13,393 --> 00:13:14,561
AFTER THE BABY IS BORN,

444
00:13:14,561 --> 00:13:15,562
ARE YOU GONNA BE ABLE TO PICK UP

445
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:16,529
YOUR WORK, OR IS SOMEONE GONNA

446
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,364
BRING IT TO YOU?

447
00:13:17,364 --> 00:13:18,531
>> EITHER SOMEONE'S GONNA GO

448
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:19,867
GET IT FOR ME, OR I'LL JUST

449
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:20,968
PICK IT UP.

450
00:13:20,968 --> 00:13:21,668
>> OKAY.

451
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:22,669
>> MISS SUE?

452
00:13:22,669 --> 00:13:23,336
>> YEAH?

453
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:25,005
>> IS THERE ANY POSSIBLE WAY,

454
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:27,007
LIKE, WE CAN, LIKE, HELP JAMES

455
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,175
FIND A PLACE TO STAY OR

456
00:13:28,175 --> 00:13:29,342
SOMETHING?

457
00:13:29,342 --> 00:13:30,510
>> I CAN BRING YOU A LIST

458
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:31,845
OF LOW-INCOME APARTMENTS UP

459
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:32,846
FOR OUR NEXT VISIT.

460
00:13:32,846 --> 00:13:34,781
>> OKAY.

461
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:35,615
>> IS HE WORKING?

462
00:13:35,615 --> 00:13:36,984
>> NO.

463
00:13:36,984 --> 00:13:38,618
BUT HE'S LOOKING.

464
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:39,887
LIKE, HE'S REALLY...

465
00:13:39,887 --> 00:13:41,054
>> SO HOW IS HE GONNA AFFORD

466
00:13:41,054 --> 00:13:43,123
HIS OWN APARTMENT?

467
00:13:43,123 --> 00:13:45,125
>> BELIEVE ME, I'VE BEEN ASKING

468
00:13:45,125 --> 00:13:47,995
THAT SAME QUESTION.

469
00:13:47,995 --> 00:13:49,329
BUT FOR RIGHT NOW, I'M PUTTING

470
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,630
THAT OUT OF MY MIND...

471
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,298
HEY.

472
00:13:51,298 --> 00:13:52,299
>> HI.

473
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:53,133
>> BECAUSE TODAY IS

474
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:53,867
MY BABY SHOWER.

475
00:13:53,867 --> 00:13:54,701
>> HELLO.

476
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:55,535
>> YAY.

477
00:13:55,535 --> 00:13:57,470
I MISSED YOU.

478
00:13:57,470 --> 00:13:58,805
HI, BLUE.

479
00:13:58,805 --> 00:13:59,639
>> WHAT'S HAPPENING?

480
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:01,308
>> HI, MAN!

481
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:02,009
>> WHAT'S UP?

482
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,643
>> WHAT'S UP!

483
00:14:03,643 --> 00:14:04,844
>> HAND ME THAT BOO.

484
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,714
HEY, MAN.

485
00:14:07,714 --> 00:14:08,481
I WANT TO SEE HOW YOU HOLD

486
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:09,216
A BABY.

487
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:09,950
>> YOU GONNA SEE,

488
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,051
JUST NOT RIGHT NOW.

489
00:14:11,051 --> 00:14:11,718
>> [fusses]

490
00:14:11,718 --> 00:14:13,053
>> I KNOW.

491
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:14,387
HE DON'T WANT TO HOLD YOU.

492
00:14:14,387 --> 00:14:15,222
>> MAN, IT AIN'T NOTHING

493
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:16,957
AGAINST YOU, BRO.

494
00:14:16,957 --> 00:14:17,958
>> IT'S GREAT TO SEE ALL

495
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,626
MY FRIENDS AGAIN, BUT I COULD

496
00:14:19,626 --> 00:14:21,261
FEEL THE TENSION BETWEEN MY MOM

497
00:14:21,261 --> 00:14:23,897
AND JAMES, AND SO CAN HE.

498
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:45,152
>> NO MATTER WHAT JAMES SAYS

499
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:46,653
TO HIS FRIENDS, HIS JOB HUNT

500
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,321
HAS FALLEN OFF TRACK.

501
00:14:48,321 --> 00:14:49,522
I USED TO SEE HIM ALL OVER

502
00:14:49,522 --> 00:14:50,690
THE HELP-WANTEDS.

503
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,025
NOW HE'S SPENDING MORE TIME

504
00:14:52,025 --> 00:14:55,528
ON MYSPACE.

505
00:14:55,528 --> 00:14:57,197
I FOUND OUT THAT ONE OF HIS EXES

506
00:14:57,197 --> 00:14:58,531
IS TRYING TO HOOK UP WITH HIM

507
00:14:58,531 --> 00:15:00,200
ONLINE, AND WITH OUR BABY DUE

508
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,534
IN LESS THAN ONE MONTH,

509
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:04,671
THAT'S TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE.

510
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:09,009
>> SO IT MEANS YOU STILL

511
00:15:09,009 --> 00:15:10,944
WANT TO CHILL WITH HER.

512
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:18,218
>> WELL, I DON'T TRUST HER.

513
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:21,454
>> I HAVE HAD NO INTIMACY WITH

514
00:15:21,454 --> 00:15:22,455
THE BOYS THAT COME OVER TO

515
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:24,124
MY HOUSE, NONE WHATSOEVER,

516
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:26,459
HUGGING, KISSING, ALL THAT OTHER

517
00:15:26,459 --> 00:15:27,294
TYPE OF STUFF.

518
00:15:27,294 --> 00:15:28,028
>> ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

519
00:15:28,028 --> 00:15:29,129
I AIN'T NEED TO HEAR THAT.

520
00:15:29,129 --> 00:15:30,463
>> I HAVE NOT DONE ANY OF THAT

521
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:31,131
WITH THEM.

522
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:31,798
>> ALL RIGHT.

523
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,733
SOUNDS GOOD.

524
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,441
>> [sighs]

525
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,109
I'M DONE.

526
00:15:42,109 --> 00:15:44,044
WHATEVER.

527
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:01,294
>> SINCE LAST NIGHT, I HAVEN'T

528
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,795
BEEN TALKING TO JAMES.

529
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,131
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE HE'S BEEN

530
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:07,500
TALKING TO HIS EX ONLINE.

531
00:16:09,936 --> 00:16:10,937
THERE'S ONLY ENOUGH ROOM

532
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:12,772
IN THE PICTURE FOR ME, JAMES,

533
00:16:12,772 --> 00:16:13,940
AND ZA'KARIA.

534
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,108
I'M SCARED TO THINK THAT JAMES

535
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:17,110
ISN'T IN THIS FOR THE LONG RUN.

536
00:16:17,110 --> 00:16:18,445
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME THAT

537
00:16:18,445 --> 00:16:20,447
ZA'KARIA HAS HER DADDY, BECAUSE

538
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:21,948
I'VE WASTED A LOT OF DAYS

539
00:16:21,948 --> 00:16:24,617
WAITING FOR MY DAD TO SHOW UP.

540
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:28,121
MY DAD LIVES AN HOUR AWAY.

541
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:29,622
HE SAID HE WAS GOING TO HELP ME

542
00:16:29,622 --> 00:16:31,624
AND JAMES FIND A PLACE TO STAY,

543
00:16:31,624 --> 00:16:32,792
AND IT'S GOING TO BE THE LAST

544
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:33,793
TIME I SEE HIM BEFORE

545
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:35,962
THE BABY COMES.

546
00:16:35,962 --> 00:16:37,297
>> AT THE TONE, PLEASE RECORD

547
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:38,465

00:16:39,132 --> 00:16:39,966
>> HEY, DAD.

00:16:50,643 --> 00:16:51,811
YEAH, SO JUST CALL ME

556

00:17:01,988 --> 00:17:04,491
DON'T SAY YOU GONNA COME.

BUT THERE HAS TO BE AN END DATE.

751
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:51,591
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

752
00:24:51,591 --> 00:24:53,526
THAT'S WHAT WE TRYING.

753
00:24:57,530 --> 00:24:58,865
>> I'M RELIEVED THAT JAMES'

754
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:00,199
LIVING SITUATION IS HANDLED

755
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:01,868
FOR THE MOMENT, BUT ALL HIS WORK

756
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:03,536
OPPORTUNITIES SEEM TO FALL

757
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:06,105
THROUGH.

758
00:25:06,105 --> 00:25:06,939
I'M SUPPOSED TO START BACK

759
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:08,340
AT THE GROCERY STORE NEXT WEEK,

760
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,141
SO AT LEAST WE'LL HAVE

761
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:10,543
A LITTLE MONEY COMING IN.

762
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:12,044
BUT TO MAKE THINGS WORK,

763
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:13,012
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BLOW

764
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,614
MY ENTIRE SAVINGS AND THEN SOME

765
00:25:14,614 --> 00:25:16,549
ON GETTING A CAR.

766
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,555
>> FOR WHAT?

767
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,156
>> YOU SAYING YOU DON'T

768
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:24,691
TRUST ME?

769
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:27,459
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING?

770
00:25:28,961 --> 00:25:30,129
>> EVER SINCE I FOUND JAMES

771
00:25:30,129 --> 00:25:32,464
CHATTING WITH HIS EX ON MYSPACE,

772
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:33,833
LITTLE THINGS THAT NEVER USED

773
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:35,001
TO BOTHER ME ARE STARTING

774
00:25:35,001 --> 00:25:37,203
TO BOTHER ME.

775
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:38,705
THE THOUGHT OF HIM AND ANOTHER

776
00:25:38,705 --> 00:25:40,372
GIRL IS ALWAYS SOMEWHERE IN

777
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,374
THE BACK OF MY HEAD.

778
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,710
[baby crying]

779
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:46,045
[shushes]

780
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,379
WHAT TIME IS IT?

781
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:48,715
>> 6:48.

782
00:25:48,715 --> 00:25:51,217
6:49.

783
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:52,051
>> ALONG WITH GOING BACK

784
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,720
TO WORK, I ALSO HAVE TO GO BACK

785
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:55,454
TO SCHOOL SO I CAN GRADUATE

786
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:57,156
ON TIME, BUT I DIDN'T REALIZE

787
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:58,324
HOW HARD IT WOULD BE TO LEAVE

788
00:25:58,324 --> 00:25:59,391
ZA'KARIA.

789
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,059
BYE.

790
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:01,728
>> BYE.

791
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:02,729
>> JAMES DROPPED ME OFF AT

792
00:26:02,729 --> 00:26:04,430
SCHOOL AND TOOK CARE OF ZA'KARIA

793
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:06,232
FOR THE REST OF THE DAY.

794
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:07,066
I DEFINITELY HOPE HER DAY

795
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,101
WAS LESS MESSED UP THAN MINE.

796
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:10,770
FIRST OFF, I'M WAY BEHIND

797
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:12,438
IN MY SCHOOLWORK.

798
00:26:12,438 --> 00:26:14,273
THEN JAMES' EX CAME RIGHT UP

799
00:26:14,273 --> 00:26:16,108
TO ME WITH SOME MESSED UP NEWS.

800
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:17,610
JAMES CHEATED ON ME WITH HER AT

801
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,278
THE START OF OUR RELATIONSHIP,

802
00:26:19,278 --> 00:26:20,279
AND THE THING THAT HURTS EVEN

803
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,281
MORE, THEY DIDN'T EVEN USE

804
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:23,616
PROTECTION.

805
00:26:23,616 --> 00:26:25,117
AND TO TOP IT OFF, I CALLED

806
00:26:25,117 --> 00:26:26,619
JAMES, AND HE TOLD ME EVERYTHING

807
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:28,788
WAS TRUE.

808
00:26:28,788 --> 00:26:30,723
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS [bleep].

809
00:26:39,966 --> 00:26:40,967
BECAUSE I NEVER CHEATED ON

810
00:26:40,967 --> 00:26:41,801
JAMES.

811
00:26:41,801 --> 00:26:42,869
I NEVER DID ANYTHING TO JAMES.

812
00:26:42,869 --> 00:26:44,036
I WAS DEFINITELY JAMES'

813
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:45,271
SINCE DAY ONE.

814
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:48,107
OH.

815
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,441
USUALLY WE HOOK UP WITH JAMES

816
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:50,609
IN THE PARKING LOT,

817
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,711
THEN WE GO PICK UP ZA'KARIA

818
00:26:51,711 --> 00:26:53,479
FROM DAY CARE, BUT TODAY,

819
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:55,748
HE DECIDED TO WALK.

820
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:10,096
>> YOU CAN'T PARK RIGHT THERE!

821
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:10,763
OH, MY GOD!

822
00:27:10,763 --> 00:27:12,765
I WILL DIE!

823
00:27:12,765 --> 00:27:14,066
>> SO YOU GONNA BE LIKE THIS?

824
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,067
ARE YOU FREAKING SERIOUS?

825
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:16,402
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO DID THIS!

826
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:17,236
IT'S YOU.

827
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:18,070
>> TWO WEEKS INTO OUR

828
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:18,771
RELATIONSHIP!

829
00:27:18,771 --> 00:27:19,906
>> IT DOESN'T [bleep] MATTER!

830
00:27:19,906 --> 00:27:20,773
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO DID THIS

831
00:27:20,773 --> 00:27:22,074
[bleep]!

832
00:27:22,074 --> 00:27:24,176
I DIDN'T EVER CHEAT ON YOU.

833
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:24,877
>> HEY, DO YOU WANT ME

834
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:25,511
TO MOVE THE CAR?

835
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:26,478
>> DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SAID?

836
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:27,246
>> DO YOU WANT TO GET MAD

837
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:27,814
AT ME?

838
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:28,480
>> I AIN'T MAD.

839
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,315
>> THE [bleep] THAT YOU DID!

840
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:30,149
>> I'M HURT 'CAUSE OF

THIS IS CRAZY.

>> EVERYTHING YOU DID

849
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:42,428
IN THE PAST?

850
00:27:42,428 --> 00:27:43,095

IT'S OVER.

YOU DON'T EVER COME SEE

AFTER OUR ROADSIDE BLOWOUT,

867
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:33,345
JAMES DIDN'T COME HOME.

868
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:35,014
WHEN MY BEST FRIEND KAIA

869
00:28:35,014 --> 00:28:36,783
FOUND OUT ABOUT OUR FIGHT...

870
00:28:36,783 --> 00:28:37,950
>> YOUR BEST FRIEND IS CRYING.

YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

879
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:56,468

00:28:59,705 --> 00:29:01,640
>> HIS--THE GIRL.

882
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:05,611
>> THE GIRL CAME AFTER SCHOOL...

883
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,319
YOU DIDN'T USE A CONDOM WITH ME,

884
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,320
AND THEN YOU DIDN'T

885
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,254
USE A CONDOM WITH HER.

886
00:29:15,254 --> 00:29:15,922

>> AND THEN YOU DIDN'T USE

888
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:18,590
A CONDOM WITH ME AGAIN.

889

THAT'S HUMILIATING.

890
00:29:30,837 --> 00:29:31,838
THAT'S EMBARRASSING.

891
00:29:31,838 --> 00:29:32,671
AND IF HE WOULD HAVE JUST,

892
00:29:32,671 --> 00:29:35,341
YOU KNOW, BEEN WITH ME,

>> I DON'T KNOW.

902
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:46,185
THAT'S JUST IT.

IN THE PAST.

907
00:29:50,556 --> 00:29:51,891
I MEAN, IF HE NOT DOING IT NOW,

908
00:29:51,891 --> 00:29:52,724
THEN IT SHOULDN'T MATTER.

909
00:29:52,724 --> 00:29:53,559
YOU SHOULDN'T THROW IT UP

HAVE TO TALK ABOUT.

915
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:05,537
YOU DIDN'T GET TO TALK HIM.

916
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:06,372
Y'ALL WAS JUST GOING BACK

917
00:30:06,372 --> 00:30:07,206

00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:44,903
>> GOOD.

937
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:45,571
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

938
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:46,238
>> GOOD.

939
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,073
DID YOU FIND EVERYTHING OKAY?

940
00:31:47,073 --> 00:31:49,008
>> YEAH, EVERYTHING'S FINE.

941
00:31:49,008 --> 00:31:50,009
>> I THOUGHT WORK WOULD HELP ME

942
00:31:50,009 --> 00:31:52,011
TAKE MY MIND OFF THE SITUATION,

943
00:31:52,011 --> 00:31:53,679
BUT I MANAGED TO STAY MAD AS

944
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,514
HELL THROUGHOUT MY WHOLE SHIFT,

945
00:31:55,514 --> 00:31:56,848
AND WHEN I GOT OFF WORK,

946
00:31:56,848 --> 00:31:58,350
JAMES WAS OUTSIDE, AND HE WANTED

947
00:31:58,350 --> 00:32:01,020
TO TALK.

948
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,021
>> I'M SORRY FOR ALL THAT

949
00:32:02,021 --> 00:32:02,854
[bleep].

950
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:04,523
I REALLY, TRULY AM.

951
00:32:04,523 --> 00:32:06,792
IF I COULD GO BACK IN TIME...

952
00:32:13,732 --> 00:32:14,900
IF YOU LOVE ME, YOU'D UNDERSTAND

953
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,835
HOW MUCH I LOVE YOU.

954
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:21,773
YOU HAVE MY HEART,

955
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:23,842
YOU AND ZA'KARIA.

956
00:32:23,842 --> 00:32:27,013
>> IF HER HOUR OF HAVING SEX

957
00:32:27,013 --> 00:32:29,015
MEANS MORE TO YOU THAN OUR TWO

958
00:32:29,015 --> 00:32:30,916
WEEKS OF BEING TOGETHER,

959
00:32:30,916 --> 00:32:31,750
JUST MAKES ME...

960
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:33,419
>> BABY, IT WAS TWO WEEKS.

961
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:34,253
WE DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING

962
00:32:34,253 --> 00:32:36,088
ABOUT EACH OTHER IN TWO WEEKS.

963
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:36,888
>> BABY, YOU WAS TELLING ME

964
00:32:36,888 --> 00:32:38,057
YOU LOVED ME AT TWO WEEKS.

965
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:39,225
I WAS PREGNANT IN, LIKE,

966
00:32:39,225 --> 00:32:41,160
TWO WEEKS.

967
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,568
>> THE BIGGEST GIFT I COULD GIVE

968
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:51,403
ZA'KARIA IS TO HAVE HER DADDY

969
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:53,739
IN HER LIFE.

970
00:32:53,739 --> 00:32:55,174
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO WORK THIS

971
00:32:55,174 --> 00:32:56,808
OUT WITH JAMES, BUT I DON'T KNOW

972
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,177
IF I'LL EVER BE ABLE TO LET THIS

973
00:32:58,177 --> 00:33:01,813
GO.

974
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,083
SO IF I CHEATED ON YOU,

975
00:33:04,083 --> 00:33:06,752
WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO TRUST ME?

976
00:33:06,752 --> 00:33:07,953
>> YES.

977
00:33:07,953 --> 00:33:08,954
YOU CANNOT SEE HOW MUCH I LOVE

978
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:09,955
YOU, HOW MUCH...

979
00:33:09,955 --> 00:33:11,457
>> THAT DOES NOT MATTER TO ME.

980
00:33:11,457 --> 00:33:12,791
>> MY LOVE DOESN'T MATTER?

981
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:13,959
THAT'S WHAT YOU JUST SAID?

982
00:33:13,959 --> 00:33:15,294
>> NO, I'M SAYING IT DOESN'T

983
00:33:15,294 --> 00:33:16,195
MATTER TO ME WHEN IT COMES

984
00:33:16,195 --> 00:33:16,795
TO THAT.

985
00:33:16,795 --> 00:33:17,463
NO, IT DOESN'T.

986
00:33:17,463 --> 00:33:18,630
>> TWO WEEKS IN A [bleep]

987
00:33:18,630 --> 00:33:19,965
RELATIONSHIP.

988
00:33:19,965 --> 00:33:22,468
>> WELL, TWO WEEKS IS...

989
00:33:22,468 --> 00:33:25,137
>> DAMN, SEE, YOU LIKE--GOSH.

990
00:33:37,216 --> 00:33:38,084
>> I'M THE ONE--DURING YOUR

991
00:33:38,084 --> 00:33:39,318
WHOLE PREGNANCY, I WAS THERE.

992
00:33:39,318 --> 00:33:40,219
ALL YOUR FRIENDS,

993
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:41,487
WHO THERE NOW?

994
00:33:41,487 --> 00:33:43,222
I WAS THERE.

995
00:33:43,222 --> 00:33:44,156
EVERY TIME YOU WAS THROWING UP,

996
00:33:44,156 --> 00:33:45,624
I'M IN THE BATHROOM HOLDING YOUR

997
00:33:45,624 --> 00:33:46,458
HAIR BACK!

998
00:33:46,458 --> 00:33:47,393
>> WHOA, YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN

999
00:33:47,393 --> 00:33:48,560
'CAUSE THIS--ALL THIS YELLING

1000
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,395
AND THIS [bleep]--

1001
00:33:49,395 --> 00:33:50,262
>> DON'T [bleep] CRITICIZE

1002
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:51,230
MY [bleep] RIGHT NOW.

1003
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,198
>> YOU REALLY NEED TO CALM DOWN.

1004
00:33:52,198 --> 00:33:52,864
>> FOR WHAT?

1005
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:53,799
>> BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE

1006
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:54,933
YELLING AT ME LIKE THAT.

1007
00:33:54,933 --> 00:33:55,934
>> I YELL AT WHO THE [bleep]

1008
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:57,169
I WANT TO YELL AT.

1009
00:33:57,169 --> 00:33:58,170
THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT OF BEING

1010
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,171
WITH SOMEBODY, BECAUSE YOU TRUST

1011
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:00,172
THEM, NOT BECAUSE YOU THINK THEY

1012
00:34:00,172 --> 00:34:01,173
GONNA SIT HERE AND [bleep]

1013
00:34:01,173 --> 00:34:03,109
SOMEBODY.

1014
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,481
HAVEN'T YOU HEARD THAT SAYING

1015
00:34:09,481 --> 00:34:10,182
BEFORE?

1016
00:34:10,182 --> 00:34:10,916
"YOU CAN TURN A [bleep]

1017
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:12,551
INTO A HOUSEWIFE"?

1018
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:14,052
>> [laughs]

1019
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,554
HELL [bleep] NO.

1020
00:34:15,554 --> 00:34:18,724
HELL NO.

1021
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:19,958
YOU JUST--

1022
00:34:19,958 --> 00:34:20,959
>> WHERE THE [bleep]--

1023
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:21,793
>> LET ME GO.

1024
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:24,296
LET GO!

1025
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:25,063
[bleep].

1026
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,064
>> I HATE YOU! OH!

1027
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,400
>> I KNOW YOU HATE ME.

1028
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,067
I KNOW YOU--

1029
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:29,735
>> [bleep] YOU!

1030
00:34:29,735 --> 00:34:30,902
I HATE YOU, YOU [bleep] IDIOT!

1031
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,070
I HATE YOU!

1032
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,071
OOH, I HATE YOU!

1033
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,406
>> STOP PUNCHING ME!

1034
00:34:34,406 --> 00:34:35,073
>> I HATE YOU!

1035
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:36,242
>> STOP PUNCHING ME.

1036
00:34:36,242 --> 00:34:37,243
YOU'RE ACTING CRAZY!

1037
00:34:37,243 --> 00:34:40,746
[bleep] WRONG WITH YOU?

1038
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:43,682
>> [sobbing]

1039
00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:20,852
>> AH, SHE SPIT UP.

1040
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:22,854
>> [crying]

1041
00:35:22,854 --> 00:35:24,022
>> SINCE OUR BIG FIGHT,

1042
00:35:24,022 --> 00:35:24,856
JAMES HASN'T SLEPT HERE

1043
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:26,192
FOR TWO NIGHTS.

1044
00:35:26,192 --> 00:35:27,193
I CAN SEE THAT ZA'KARIA

1045
00:35:27,193 --> 00:35:28,327
MISSES HER DADDY

1046
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:29,828
BECAUSE SO DO I.

1047
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:32,831
[shushes]

1048
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:34,733
I HATE DOING THIS.

1049
00:35:34,733 --> 00:35:36,568
[phone ringing]

1050
00:35:36,568 --> 00:35:37,369
HELLO?

1051
00:35:37,369 --> 00:35:38,704
>> HEY, MARKAI.

1052
00:35:38,704 --> 00:35:40,639
>> HEY, DADDY.

1053
00:35:43,542 --> 00:35:45,477
>> YOU ARE?

1054
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,549
>> YOU COMING OVER NOW?

1055
00:35:50,549 --> 00:35:51,550
>> YEAH.

1056
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,219
>> WHY IS THIS A SURPRISE?

1057
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:54,052
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME

1058
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:54,720
YESTERDAY?

1059
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,323
>> [laughs]

1060
00:36:01,026 --> 00:36:03,195
>> HEY, DADDY.

1061
00:36:03,195 --> 00:36:04,630
>> HOW YOU DOING?

1062
00:36:04,630 --> 00:36:05,531
LOVE YOU, BABY.

1063
00:36:05,531 --> 00:36:06,798
LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

1064
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:07,799
YOU DOING OKAY?

1065
00:36:07,799 --> 00:36:08,634
>> YEAH.

1066
00:36:08,634 --> 00:36:11,237
>> GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD.

1067
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,741
>> IT MADE ME PROUD TO SEE MY

1068
00:36:15,741 --> 00:36:18,710
DAD SO HAPPY TO BE A GRANDDADDY.

1069
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:19,545
>> LOOK AT YOUR PRETTY SELF.

1070
00:36:19,545 --> 00:36:21,046
YES, YOU ARE ADORABLE.

1071
00:36:21,046 --> 00:36:22,548
YOU KNOW WHO THIS IS, DON'T YOU?

1072
00:36:22,548 --> 00:36:24,483
IT PA DADDY.

1073
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:25,951
IT PA DADDY.

1074
00:36:25,951 --> 00:36:27,118
>> THIS IS A SHOCK THAT YOU'RE

1075
00:36:27,118 --> 00:36:28,086
HERE.

1076
00:36:28,086 --> 00:36:29,221
>> YEAH.

1077
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:31,156
IT'S GOOD TO BE HERE, THOUGH.

1078
00:36:31,156 --> 00:36:32,491
>> HE ASKED WHERE JAMES WAS,

1079
00:36:32,491 --> 00:36:33,659
AND I HAD TO LET HIM KNOW

1080
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:35,494
WE WERE HAVING SOME TROUBLES.

1081
00:36:35,494 --> 00:36:37,696
>> I TELL YOU, MARKAI.

1082
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:40,065
WHEN I MARRIED YOUR MOTHER

1083
00:36:40,065 --> 00:36:42,734
AND WHEN WE HAD CHILDREN,

1084
00:36:42,734 --> 00:36:44,736
I DID NOT ASK FOR THIS

1085
00:36:44,736 --> 00:36:46,238
FOR MY KIDS.

1086
00:36:46,238 --> 00:36:48,240
I WANTED YOU GUYS TO LIVE

1087
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,242
IN A WHOLESOME ENVIRONMENT

1088
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:52,043
WHERE IT'S FULL OF LOVE.

1089
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:56,214
AND WHEN YOU GUYS LEFT ME,

1090
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:59,050
THAT HAPPY LITTLE GIRL,

1091
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,887
I SAW YOUR FACE JUST CHANGE,

1092
00:37:01,887 --> 00:37:03,889
AND THAT HURT ME SO MUCH,

1093
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:06,224
BECAUSE I KNEW THAT THERE WAS

1094
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:07,726
A WALL NOW THAT WAS GONNA BE

1095
00:37:07,726 --> 00:37:09,561
BUILT UP AROUND YOU,

1096
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:11,563
A BRICK WALL, THAT YOU COULDN'T

1097
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:14,400
TRUST ANYMORE.

1098
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,535
YOU WEREN'T GONNA TRUST NOBODY.

1099
00:37:16,535 --> 00:37:17,369
YOU WEREN'T GONNA LISTEN

1100
00:37:17,369 --> 00:37:18,537
TO ANYBODY.

1101
00:37:18,537 --> 00:37:21,106
YOU JUST CLOSED UP.

1102
00:37:21,106 --> 00:37:25,611
IF I HAVE NOT BEEN THERE FOR YOU

1103
00:37:25,611 --> 00:37:27,446
AS MUCH AS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN,

1104
00:37:27,446 --> 00:37:29,948
I APOLOGIZE, OKAY?

1105
00:37:29,948 --> 00:37:31,283
WITH YOU AND JAMES, IT WAS

1106
00:37:31,283 --> 00:37:33,452
A ROCKY ROAD, OKAY?

1107
00:37:33,452 --> 00:37:34,286
NOW YOU HAVE A BABY,

1108
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:35,921
A BEAUTIFUL BABY--

1109
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:37,589
DON'T CARE HOW YOU GUYS

1110
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:38,757
CONCEIVED OR IF IT WAS

1111
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:39,591
A MISTAKE OR NOT.

1112
00:37:39,591 --> 00:37:40,258
I DON'T CARE.

1113
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,427
SHE'S NOT A MISTAKE.

1114
00:37:41,427 --> 00:37:44,396
SHE IS BEAUTIFUL AND GORGEOUS.

1115
00:37:44,396 --> 00:37:46,465
>> EVEN BEFORE I EVEN MET JAMES,

1116
00:37:46,465 --> 00:37:47,366
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T EVEN PLAN

1117
00:37:47,366 --> 00:37:48,300
ON HAVING BABIES THIS EARLY.

1118
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,968
I WAS THINKING WAY AFTER,

1119
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:51,303
YOU KNOW, SCHOOL AND ALL THAT

1120
00:37:51,303 --> 00:37:52,971
STUFF, BUT I TOLD MYSELF

1121
00:37:52,971 --> 00:37:54,373
IF I WAS GONNA HAVE A BABY,

1122
00:37:54,373 --> 00:37:55,374
THAT BABY IS GONNA HAVE A DADDY,

1123
00:37:55,374 --> 00:37:56,041
NO MATTER WHAT.

1124
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:57,208
I DON'T CARE IF WE'RE TOGETHER.

1125
00:37:57,208 --> 00:37:58,209
I DON'T CARE IF WE HATE

1126
00:37:58,209 --> 00:37:59,044
EACH OTHER.

1127
00:37:59,044 --> 00:38:00,045
I DON'T CARE.

1128
00:38:00,045 --> 00:38:01,713
THAT BABY IS GONNA BE

1129
00:38:01,713 --> 00:38:03,715
THAT MAN'S MAIN PRIORITY.

1130
00:38:03,715 --> 00:38:05,050
AND THAT'S WHO ZA'KARIA

1131
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,217
IS TO JAMES.

1132
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:07,052
JAMES CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT

1133
00:38:07,052 --> 00:38:07,719
ZA'KARIA.

1134
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:08,387
>> RIGHT.

1135
00:38:08,387 --> 00:38:09,888
>> ME, HE CAN BE OKAY WITH.

1136
00:38:09,888 --> 00:38:10,889
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

1137
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:11,823
HE'LL BE ALL RIGHT WITHOUT ME.

1138
00:38:11,823 --> 00:38:15,060
WITHOUT HIS BABY...

1139
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:16,728
>> * THIS AIN'T THE LIFE *

1140
00:38:16,728 --> 00:38:19,064
* I THOUGHT I'D LIVE *

1141
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:20,065
* THIS AIN'T THE HOME *

1142
00:38:20,065 --> 00:38:22,734

* THIS AIN'T THE SKY *

1146
00:38:27,072 --> 00:38:29,575
* I'D HOPED WE'D SEE *

1147
00:38:29,575 --> 00:38:30,876
* THIS AIN'T THE TREE *

1148
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:33,011
* I THOUGHT WOULD GROW *

1149
00:38:33,011 --> 00:38:34,380
* THIS AIN'T THE GOD *

1150
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,881
* TO WHICH I PRAY *

1151
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:37,383
>> IT IS HARD.

1152
00:38:37,383 --> 00:38:39,050
I'M NOT GONNA SIT UP HERE

1153
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:40,886
AND LIE.

1154
00:38:40,886 --> 00:38:42,320
IT IS VERY HARD.

1155
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,556
>> HEY, BIRTHDAY GIRL.

1156
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:45,824
>> MY RELATIONSHIP WITH MY MOM

1157
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:48,827
HAS CHANGED, AS I'M NOT AS OPEN

1158
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,562
WITH HER AS I USED TO BE.

1159
00:38:50,562 --> 00:38:52,564
>> THERE THAT BE MY BABY GIRL.

1160
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:54,666
>> GETTING PREGNANT PUSHED ME

1161
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:55,567
AWAY.

1162
00:38:55,567 --> 00:38:56,835
SHE FELT LIKE I WAS GONNA BE

1163
00:38:56,835 --> 00:38:58,169
LIKE THESE OTHER TEENAGE MOMS

1164
00:38:58,169 --> 00:39:01,172
THAT SHE'S SEEN, AND THAT'S JUST

1165
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,240
NOT THE WAY I AM.

1166
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,342
ME AND MY MOM USED TO BE, LIKE,

1167
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,677
THE BEST OF FRIENDS.

1168
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,379
I USED TO TELL HER EVERYTHING.

1169
00:39:07,379 --> 00:39:08,380
I USED TO FEEL LIKE I COULD BE

1170
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,214
OPEN WITH HER.

1171
00:39:09,214 --> 00:39:10,716
AND I JUST FEEL LIKE THERE'S

1172
00:39:10,716 --> 00:39:11,717
SOME STUFF THAT SHE NEEDS

1173
00:39:11,717 --> 00:39:12,584
TO KNOW AND SOME STUFF THAT

1174
00:39:12,584 --> 00:39:14,786
SHE DOESN'T.

1175
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:15,521
[camera clicking]

1176
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:16,121
>> THERE WE GO.

1177
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:16,788
THERE WE GO.

1178
00:39:16,788 --> 00:39:17,523
GOOD. GOOD.

1179
00:39:17,523 --> 00:39:18,123
>> HI, THERE.

1180
00:39:18,123 --> 00:39:18,790
>> OH, I LIKE THAT.

1181
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:19,691
LOOKING AT YOU, THAT'S CUTE.

1182
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:20,526
>> YOU'RE SO CUTE.

1183
00:39:20,526 --> 00:39:21,126
>> THERE YOU GO.

1184
00:39:21,126 --> 00:39:22,628
>> HI, MAMI!

1185
00:39:22,628 --> 00:39:24,696
AH, YEAH.

1186
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:25,697
HI, MAMA.

1187
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,265
>> THAT'S PERFECT.

1188
00:39:27,265 --> 00:39:29,100
>> A GIRL NEEDS HER FATHER,

1189
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:32,270
BECAUSE WHATEVER HER FATHER

1190
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:34,272
DOES, THAT'S WHAT SHE'S GONNA

1191
00:39:34,272 --> 00:39:36,608
LOOK INSIDE--FROM ANY MAN

1192
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:40,278
OR ANY BOY THAT SHE'S WITH.

1193
00:39:40,278 --> 00:39:42,113
>> * THIS AIN'T THE END *

1194
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:43,982
* I THOUGHT IT'D BE *

1195
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:45,551

* I'VE LOVED BEFORE? *

1197
00:39:46,552 --> 00:39:48,386
>> JAMES MIGHT NOT BE

1198
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:50,055
THE PERFECT GUY.

1199
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:51,056
LIKE I SAID, OBVIOUSLY,

1200
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:52,390
I DID NOT KNOW THE WHOLE TRUTH,

1201
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:53,158
BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE NEVER

1202
00:39:53,158 --> 00:39:58,363
THOUGHT YOU WOULD DO THAT TO ME.

1203
00:39:58,363 --> 00:39:59,364
>> YOU...

1204
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:02,033
YOU SIT UP HERE AND ACT LIKE

1205
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:05,203
I HAVEN'T EVEN CHANGED,

1206
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:06,037
LIKE, FROM THE [bleep]

1207
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:09,575
THAT YOU KNEW I DID BACK THEN.

1208
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:10,709
LIKE, YOU ACT LIKE I HAVEN'T

1209
00:40:10,709 --> 00:40:11,710
EVEN, LIKE--I HAVEN'T EVEN

1210
00:40:11,710 --> 00:40:12,611
TRIED TO CHANGE OR I HAVEN'T

1211
00:40:12,611 --> 00:40:13,579
EVEN CHANGED A LITTLE BIT,

1212
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:15,013
LIKE, AT ALL.

1213
00:40:15,013 --> 00:40:16,848
>> AND I'M SURELY NOT

1214
00:40:16,848 --> 00:40:18,349
THE PERFECT WOMAN.

1215
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:19,150
>> YOU HIT ME.

1216
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:19,985
WHAT YOU MEAN?

1217
00:40:19,985 --> 00:40:20,986
YOU HIT ME.

1218
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:21,987
THAT'S HOW YOU SHOULD KNOW

1219
00:40:21,987 --> 00:40:22,821
I LOVE YOU.

1220
00:40:22,821 --> 00:40:23,989
>> I AIN'T HIT YOU HARD.

1221
00:40:23,989 --> 00:40:24,990
>> YOU HIT ME DEAD IN MY--

1222
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,658
I COULD FEEL IT RIGHT HERE.

1223
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:28,694
YOU HIT ME DEAD IN MY [bleep].

1224
00:40:28,694 --> 00:40:29,695
>> I'M JUST READY.

1225
00:40:29,695 --> 00:40:31,029
I'M READY TO STOP FIGHTING.

1226
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:31,863
I'M READY TO STOP FUSSING,

1227
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:32,698
ARGUING.

1228
00:40:32,698 --> 00:40:33,532
I WANT TO GIVE THIS THING

1229
00:40:33,532 --> 00:40:37,969
A CHANCE.

1230
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:40,305
NOBODY HAS AN EASY ROAD AHEAD.

1231
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:42,140
ME AND JAMES WILL HAVE BUMPS

1232
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,141
IN OUR ROAD.

1233
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:44,142
WE'RE ALWAYS GONNA HAVE

1234
00:40:44,142 --> 00:40:45,243
BUMPS IN OUR ROAD.

1235
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:46,244
BUT AS LONG AS WE GET THROUGH

1236
00:40:46,244 --> 00:40:47,913
IT, WE'LL BE OKAY.

1237
00:40:47,913 --> 00:40:49,715
WITHOUT GETTING A FLAT TIRE,

1238
00:40:49,715 --> 00:40:50,882
WE'LL BE FINE.
