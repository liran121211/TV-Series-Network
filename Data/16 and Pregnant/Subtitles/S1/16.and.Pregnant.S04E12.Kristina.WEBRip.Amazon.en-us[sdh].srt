MAYBE SOONER OR LATER,

147
00:04:18,119 --> 00:04:18,775
YOU WOULD CHANGE YOUR MIND

148
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,087

HOW I WANT TO REMEMBER TODD.

161
00:04:40,383 --> 00:04:41,453
IT'S, LIKE, HARD TO FIGURE OUT

162
00:04:41,557 --> 00:04:43,593
HOW TO DEAL WITH IT.

167
00:04:50,704 --> 00:04:51,981
AND WE'D WRESTLE AROUND

168
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:54,880
AND JUST LAUGH ALL THE TIME.

169
00:04:54,984 --> 00:04:56,123
I REMEMBER ONE TIME,

170
00:04:56,226 --> 00:04:56,848
ONE OF MY BRAS

171
00:04:56,951 --> 00:04:59,195
WERE LAYING ON THE BED.

172
00:04:59,299 --> 00:04:59,989
I LEFT OUT OF THE ROOM

173
00:05:00,092 --> 00:05:00,783
TO GO TO THE BATHROOM,

174
00:05:00,886 --> 00:05:01,749
AND I CAME BACK, AND THEN

175
00:05:01,853 --> 00:05:02,612
ALL OF A SUDDEN HE POPS

176
00:05:02,716 --> 00:05:04,200
OUT OF THE BED, AND HE HAS

177
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:06,236
MY BRA OVER HIS SHIRT!

178
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,893
AND I JUST DIED LAUGHING,

179
00:05:07,997 --> 00:05:08,791
'CAUSE IT WAS, LIKE, SOMETHING

180
00:05:08,894 --> 00:05:10,551

182
00:05:11,621 --> 00:05:12,312

183
00:05:12,415 --> 00:05:13,554
THE DUMBEST THINGS, I SWEAR,

184
00:05:13,658 --> 00:05:15,763
BUT IT WAS, I DON'T KNOW--

185
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:16,626
IT MADE SENSE

186
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:19,767
'CAUSE IT WAS WITH HIM.

187
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:20,975
I MISS THAT.

188
00:05:21,079 --> 00:05:23,150
I MISS HEARING HIS LAUGH

189

00:05:27,844 --> 00:05:29,190
IS SUPPOSED TO START NEXT MONTH,

193
00:05:29,294 --> 00:05:30,019
BUT WITH EVERYTHING

194
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:31,296
THAT'S HAPPENED, I'M NOT SURE

195
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,263
ABOUT GOING BACK TO SCHOOL.

196
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:34,368
>> ARE YOU GONNA GO BACK

197
00:05:34,472 --> 00:05:35,231
TO CHEERLEADING?

198
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,059
>> LIKE, I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE--

199
00:05:36,163 --> 00:05:37,026
LIKE, TRYOUT FOR CHEERLEADER

200
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:38,441
FOR MY SENIOR YEAR, YOU KNOW.

201
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:39,200
>> MM-HMM.

202
00:05:39,304 --> 00:05:39,891
>> I'M NOT REALLY WORRIED

203
00:05:39,994 --> 00:05:41,996
ABOUT CHEERING.

204
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,825
>> DO YOU LIKE LIVING HERE

205
00:05:42,928 --> 00:05:43,550
BETTER?

206
00:05:43,653 --> 00:05:44,344
>> YEAH, IT WAS, LIKE,

207
00:05:44,447 --> 00:05:45,931
VERY TENSE AT MY MOM'S.

208
00:05:46,035 --> 00:05:46,967
MY MOM IS JUST, LIKE,

209
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:48,278
UP UNDER ME.

210
00:05:48,382 --> 00:05:49,970
LIKE, "I WANT TO HELP YOU!"

211
00:05:50,073 --> 00:05:51,212
BUT THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN SAY

212
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:53,698
TO, LIKE, MAKE IT BETTER.

213
00:05:53,801 --> 00:05:54,492
SO I WOULD, LIKE,

214
00:05:54,595 --> 00:05:55,424
LOCK MYSELF IN THE BATHROOM,

215
00:05:55,527 --> 00:05:56,252
AND, LIKE, SHE WOULD

216
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:57,460
BEAT ON THE DOOR OR SOMETHING.

217
00:05:57,564 --> 00:05:58,150
>> I THINK IT'S GOOD

218
00:05:58,254 --> 00:05:59,876
THAT YOU'RE HERE.

219
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,084
HOW'S TODD'S MOM

220
00:06:01,188 --> 00:06:03,293
DEALING WITH EVERYTHING?

221
00:06:05,123 --> 00:06:05,744
>> DOES IT MAKE YOU SAD

222
00:06:05,848 --> 00:06:06,538
WHEN SHE COMES OVER

223
00:06:06,642 --> 00:06:07,815
AND TALKS ABOUT IT WITH YOU?

224
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,646
>> IT MAKES ME MISS HIM MORE.

225
00:06:10,749 --> 00:06:11,440
>> WELL, IF YOU HOLD IT IN

226
00:06:11,543 --> 00:06:12,544
A LONG TIME, WHEN YOU BREAK,

227
00:06:12,648 --> 00:06:14,374
IT'S GONNA BE EVEN WORSE.

228
00:06:14,477 --> 00:06:16,514
>> YEAH.

229
00:06:23,797 --> 00:06:25,177
TODD'S MOM HAS BEEN WORRIED

230
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:26,386
ABOUT HOW I'M DOING WITH

231
00:06:26,489 --> 00:06:28,802
THE PREGNANCY AFTER LOSING TODD,

232
00:06:28,905 --> 00:06:29,699
AND SINCE I'M DUE

233
00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:31,356
IN JUST THREE MONTHS, SHE WANTED

234
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,944
TO COME OVER AND TALK TODAY.

235
00:06:33,047 --> 00:06:33,634
>> COME ON IN, MOM.

236
00:06:33,738 --> 00:06:37,880
>> HEY, SON.

237
00:06:37,983 --> 00:06:40,986
KRISTINA...

238
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:42,056
I LOVE YOU.

239
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,920
YOU OKAY, BABY?

240
00:06:44,024 --> 00:06:45,405
>> YEAH, I'M FINE.

241
00:06:45,508 --> 00:06:48,097
>> I KNOW THAT EVERYBODY HANDLES

242
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,446
EVERYTHING IN THEIR OWN WAY.

243
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,932
THOUGH HE WAS MY SON, I FEEL

244
00:06:56,036 --> 00:06:59,142
LIKE A PART OF YOU HAS TO HURT

245
00:06:59,246 --> 00:07:04,354
ALMOST AS SEVERELY AS I DO.

246
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,908
I'M SCARED, IF YOU DON'T

247
00:07:06,011 --> 00:07:08,738
RELEASE SOME OF THAT STRESS,

248
00:07:08,842 --> 00:07:10,084
THAT IT'S GONNA CAUSE YOU

249
00:07:10,188 --> 00:07:11,258
TO HAVE PROBLEMS

250
00:07:11,361 --> 00:07:13,778
DURING THIS PREGNANCY.

251
00:07:13,881 --> 00:07:14,951
GRANTED, I DON'T WANT YOU

252
00:07:15,055 --> 00:07:17,402
FALLING APART LIKE I AM, OKAY?

253
00:07:17,506 --> 00:07:18,576
>> BUT I CAN'T TALK ABOUT

254
00:07:18,679 --> 00:07:22,096
THE DAY 'CAUSE, I MEAN--

255
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:22,787
>> IT'S PAINFUL.

256
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:24,271
>> IT TAKES--I MEAN,

257
00:07:24,374 --> 00:07:25,514
I KNOW IT'S PAINFUL FOR Y'ALL,

258
00:07:25,617 --> 00:07:28,931
BUT BEING IN THE WATER TOO,

259
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:29,759
TALKING ABOUT IT JUST

260
00:07:29,863 --> 00:07:31,312
TAKES IT BACK.

261
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,073
AT FIRST, YOU HAVE

262
00:07:33,176 --> 00:07:34,695
THE NIGHTMARES, AND THEN

263
00:07:34,799 --> 00:07:36,904
YOU HAVE THE "WHY DIDN'T--

264
00:07:37,008 --> 00:07:37,905
WHY DIDN'T I DIE, TOO,

265
00:07:38,009 --> 00:07:39,493
WITH HIM?"

266
00:07:39,597 --> 00:07:42,945
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE POINT

267
00:07:43,048 --> 00:07:44,187
FOR GOD LETTING YOU

268
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,707
FIND SOMEBODY TO BE WITH

269
00:07:46,811 --> 00:07:51,022
AND GET ATTACHED TO

270
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,369
AND THEN JUST TAKE HIM

271
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,889
BUT SAVE YOU?

272
00:07:59,824 --> 00:08:03,068
[sniffles]

273
00:08:03,172 --> 00:08:03,759
I JUST DON'T LIKE

274
00:08:03,862 --> 00:08:05,139
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

275
00:08:05,243 --> 00:08:08,073
>> I NEED TO GET SOME AIR.

276
00:08:08,177 --> 00:08:08,971
I'M SORRY.

277
00:08:09,074 --> 00:08:11,042
>> ALL RIGHT, MOM, THAT'S FINE.

278
00:08:57,019 --> 00:08:57,882
>> EVEN THOUGH TODD'S MOM

279
00:08:57,985 --> 00:08:58,848
AND MY MOM THINK TALKING

280
00:08:58,952 --> 00:09:00,367
ABOUT HIS DEATH WILL HELP ME,

281
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,195
REMEMBERING THAT DAY

282
00:09:01,299 --> 00:09:03,473
IS TOO PAINFUL,

283
00:09:03,577 --> 00:09:04,509
AND WHAT I REALLY HAVE

284
00:09:04,613 --> 00:09:06,684
TO BE FOCUSED ON IS THE BABY.

285
00:09:06,787 --> 00:09:07,477
WHEN I FIRST FOUND OUT

286
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:09,031
I WAS PREGNANT, TODD SAID

287
00:09:09,134 --> 00:09:10,619
HE LIKED THE NAME LUKAS,

288
00:09:10,722 --> 00:09:12,690
SO THAT'S WHAT I'VE DECIDED ON.

289
00:09:12,793 --> 00:09:14,933
I THINK LUKAS IS GONNA LIKE IT.

290
00:09:15,037 --> 00:09:16,072
>> I'M READY TO SEE HOW MUCH

291
00:09:16,176 --> 00:09:18,799
HE LOOKS LIKE LITTLE TODD.

292
00:09:18,903 --> 00:09:19,835
>> SO WHAT ALL DO WE HAVE LEFT

293
00:09:19,938 --> 00:09:22,562
TO DO FOR OUR BABY SHOWER?

294
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:23,735
ORDER THE FOOD.

295
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:24,564
DECORATIONS NEXT FRIDAY.

296
00:09:24,667 --> 00:09:25,219
>> I GOT TO GET--

297
00:09:25,323 --> 00:09:25,910
YEAH, I GOT TO GET

298
00:09:26,013 --> 00:09:26,635
THE DECORATIONS.

299
00:09:26,738 --> 00:09:27,428
YOU GOT TO GET THE CRIB

300
00:09:27,532 --> 00:09:28,913
AND STUFF SO WE CAN GO AHEAD

301
00:09:29,016 --> 00:09:30,052
AND SET THAT UP.

302
00:09:30,155 --> 00:09:30,742
>> THE ONLY THING

303
00:09:30,846 --> 00:09:31,432
I'M NERVOUS ABOUT

304
00:09:31,536 --> 00:09:33,573
IS PEOPLE NOT COMING.

305
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,990
SUMMER'S OVER NEXT WEEK,

306
00:09:37,093 --> 00:09:38,301
BUT I'VE DECIDED THAT INSTEAD OF

307
00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:39,440
GOING BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL,

308
00:09:39,544 --> 00:09:40,269
IT WOULD BE BEST

309
00:09:40,372 --> 00:09:41,650
TO LOOK INTO GETTING MY G.E.D.

310
00:09:41,753 --> 00:09:42,823
AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

311
00:09:42,927 --> 00:09:43,686
I HAVE TO BE AT THE COLLEGE

312
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:45,032
AT 11:00.

313
00:09:45,136 --> 00:09:46,033
>> THAT'S REALLY GREAT THAT

314
00:09:46,137 --> 00:09:47,207
YOU AND YOUR MOM ARE ACTUALLY

315
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,657
GOING AND DOING THINGS TOGETHER.

316
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:49,347
[horn honks]

317
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,624
>> ALL RIGHT, LOVE YOU.

318
00:09:50,728 --> 00:09:53,731
>> LOVE YOU TOO.

319
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:54,455
>> HAVE YOU GRADUATED

320
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:55,111
HIGH SCHOOL YET?

321
00:09:55,215 --> 00:09:57,389
>> NO, UM...

322
00:10:00,841 --> 00:10:01,635
>> OKAY, 'CAUSE WE DO

323
00:10:01,739 --> 00:10:02,705
OFFER A PROGRAM

324
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:03,706
FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS

325
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:04,431
WHERE THEY CAN FINISH

326
00:10:04,534 --> 00:10:06,675
HIGH SCHOOL HERE.

327
00:10:06,778 --> 00:10:08,469
SO WHAT KIND OF EXTRACURRICULAR

328
00:10:08,573 --> 00:10:09,229
ACTIVITIES ARE YOU

329
00:10:09,332 --> 00:10:10,989
WANTING TO BE INVOLVED IN?

330
00:10:11,093 --> 00:10:13,716
>> I DIDN'T THINK ABOUT ANY.

331
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,579
I JUST THOUGHT ABOUT JUST GOING

332
00:10:14,683 --> 00:10:15,407
TO SCHOOL AND GET IT OVER WITH.

333
00:10:15,511 --> 00:10:16,063
>> IN SCHOOL, SHE USED TO

334
00:10:16,167 --> 00:10:16,754
PLAY VOLLEYBALL,

335
00:10:16,857 --> 00:10:17,409
STUFF LIKE THAT,

336
00:10:17,513 --> 00:10:18,238
AND SHE WAS GOOD.

337
00:10:18,341 --> 00:10:19,101
>> OKAY. YEAH.

338
00:10:19,204 --> 00:10:19,826
>> IN HIGH SCHOOL,

339
00:10:19,929 --> 00:10:20,723
SHE DID EVERYTHING.

340
00:10:20,827 --> 00:10:21,862
YOU KNOW, STRAIGHT "A" STUDENT,

341
00:10:21,966 --> 00:10:22,829
SO THE PREGNANCY

342
00:10:22,932 --> 00:10:24,693
WAS REALLY A SHOCKER.

343
00:10:24,796 --> 00:10:25,866
>> YEAH.

344
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,074
SO WHAT IS YOUR SON'S NAME?

345
00:10:27,178 --> 00:10:28,317
>> LUKAS.

346
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:28,973
HERE, I CAN SHOW YOU

347
00:10:29,076 --> 00:10:29,801
A PICTURE OF HIM.

348
00:10:29,905 --> 00:10:30,699
THAT'S MY FAVORITE SONOGRAM,

349
00:10:30,802 --> 00:10:31,354
FOR SURE.

350
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,114
>> THAT IS THE BEST.

351
00:10:32,217 --> 00:10:33,287
>> HE'S BLOWING BUBBLES.

352
00:10:33,391 --> 00:10:34,047
[laughter]

353
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,532
>> I SEE THAT. YES.

354
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,534
IS YOUR BOYFRIEND OR ANYTHING

355
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,604
COMING, OR...

356
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,468
>> MM-MM.

357
00:10:41,571 --> 00:10:44,195
HE--HE'S MY FIANCE, ACTUALLY.

358
00:10:44,298 --> 00:10:46,231
>> OKAY.

359
00:10:46,335 --> 00:10:47,750
>> AND HE PASSED AWAY.

360
00:10:47,854 --> 00:10:49,890
>> [sighs]

361
00:10:52,997 --> 00:10:53,756
>> THEY WERE SWIMMING

362
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:59,935
AT GALVESTON BEACH, AND I JUST--

363
00:11:00,038 --> 00:11:01,143
I REMEMBER SCREAMING HER NAME

364
00:11:01,246 --> 00:11:01,902
AND JUST TAKING OFF

365
00:11:02,006 --> 00:11:02,662
FOR THE WATER.

366
00:11:02,765 --> 00:11:04,664
>> YEAH.

367
00:11:04,767 --> 00:11:05,595
>> LUCKILY, THE LIFEGUARD

368
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:06,424
WAS ABLE TO GET TO HER,

369
00:11:06,527 --> 00:11:09,116
'CAUSE I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING.

370
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,428
AND I REMEMBER FEELING RELIEF

371
00:11:10,531 --> 00:11:12,844
AND JUST HAPPY,

372
00:11:12,948 --> 00:11:13,603
AND THEN I REALIZED

373
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,847
TODD WASN'T WITH THEM.

374
00:11:15,951 --> 00:11:16,641
>> I'M VERY SORRY

375
00:11:16,745 --> 00:11:18,712
YOU HAD TO GO THROUGH THAT.

376
00:11:28,584 --> 00:11:30,344
>> BABY, I WANT TO

377
00:11:30,448 --> 00:11:31,242
TAKE IT ALL AWAY.

378
00:11:31,345 --> 00:11:35,142
I WANT TO FIX IT, AND I CAN'T.

379
00:11:35,246 --> 00:11:36,281
BUT IF YOU'RE GONNA BLOW

380
00:11:36,385 --> 00:11:38,076
ONE OF THESE DAYS AND--

381
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,008
LIKE I DO, YOU KNOW,

382
00:11:39,112 --> 00:11:39,768
TILL I GET MAD--

383
00:11:39,871 --> 00:11:40,389
>> I JUST FEEL LIKE NOBODY

384
00:11:40,492 --> 00:11:44,082
UNDERSTANDS IT.

385
00:11:44,186 --> 00:11:46,395
>> I WORRY ABOUT YOU.

386
00:11:51,607 --> 00:11:52,815
ALL RIGHT, BABY.

387
00:11:52,919 --> 00:11:54,437
CAN I GET A HUG BEFORE YOU GO?

388
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:55,645
COME HERE.

389
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:56,888
LOVE YOU. BE GOOD.

390
00:11:56,992 --> 00:11:57,613
>> BYE.

391
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,510
>> I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

392
00:11:58,614 --> 00:11:59,166
>> I KNOW YOU WILL.

393
00:11:59,270 --> 00:12:00,443
>> GOT YOUR PHONE?

394
00:12:00,547 --> 00:12:01,582
YOU GOT YOUR--

395
00:12:01,686 --> 00:12:03,723
OKAY.

396
00:12:11,213 --> 00:12:12,214
>> ME AND MY MOM HAD PLANS TODAY

397
00:12:12,317 --> 00:12:13,180
TO DECIDE ON A CAKE

398
00:12:13,284 --> 00:12:15,182
FOR MY BABY SHOWER, BUT I TOLD

399
00:12:15,286 --> 00:12:17,115
HER I WAS STAYING HOME INSTEAD.

400
00:12:17,219 --> 00:12:18,392
SHE'S BEEN CALLING ME ALL DAY,

401
00:12:18,496 --> 00:12:19,152
BUT I JUST NEED

402
00:12:19,255 --> 00:12:20,878
SOME TIME AWAY FROM HER.

403
00:12:20,981 --> 00:12:22,742
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

404
00:12:22,845 --> 00:12:23,397
>> FILLING OUT

405
00:12:23,501 --> 00:12:24,640
BABY SHOWER INVITES.

406
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,365
>> SO HOW MANY PEOPLE

407
00:12:25,468 --> 00:12:26,469
YOU GOT SO FAR?

408
00:12:26,573 --> 00:12:28,195
>> LIKE, 137.

409
00:12:28,299 --> 00:12:29,196
>> I'M NOT FEEDING THAT MANY

410
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,404
PEOPLE, SO WE NEED, LIKE, 37.

411
00:12:30,508 --> 00:12:31,060
>> [laughs]

412
00:12:31,164 --> 00:12:32,372
WELL, ONLY 37

413
00:12:32,475 --> 00:12:33,235
WILL PROBABLY COME.

414
00:12:33,338 --> 00:12:34,339
>> YEAH, THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE.

415
00:12:34,443 --> 00:12:35,547
>> I MEAN, TODD TALKED ABOUT IT.

416
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:36,756
IT WAS JUST, LIKE, HE WAS LIKE--

417
00:12:36,859 --> 00:12:37,446
>> OH, YEAH, HE HAD

418
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:38,343
HIS SELECT FEW PEOPLE.

419
00:12:38,447 --> 00:12:39,759
>> "I'M NOT GONNA GO.

420
00:12:39,862 --> 00:12:40,967
IT'S A GIRL THING."

421
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:41,968
>> YEAH.

422
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:43,314
>> NOW IT'S TURNED INTO, LIKE,

423
00:12:43,417 --> 00:12:44,833
A BIG FAMILY THING.

424
00:12:44,936 --> 00:12:45,626
AND I THINK IT WOULD HAVE

425
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:46,593
TURNED OUT THAT WAY ANYWAY.

426
00:12:46,696 --> 00:12:47,283
>> YEAH, I BELIEVE

427
00:12:47,387 --> 00:12:48,112
IT WOULD HAVE.

428
00:12:48,215 --> 00:12:49,078
>> BECAUSE HE NEVER LEFT ME,

429
00:12:49,182 --> 00:12:51,598
AND I NEVER LEFT HIS SIDE.

430
00:12:51,701 --> 00:12:53,496
>> YEP.

431
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,394
[phone vibrates]

432
00:12:54,497 --> 00:12:55,740
>> MOM'S CALLING ME.

433
00:12:55,844 --> 00:12:56,948
SHE'S, LIKE, FREAKING OUT.

434
00:12:57,052 --> 00:12:59,054
[phone beeps]

435
00:12:59,157 --> 00:12:59,917
SHE MAKES ME CRAZY.

436
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:02,091
>> STILL...

437
00:13:08,511 --> 00:13:11,549
[phone rings]

438
00:13:12,964 --> 00:13:13,551
>> HELLO?

439
00:13:13,654 --> 00:13:15,691
>> HEY.

440
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:29,843
>> I DON'T SEE WHY

441
00:13:29,947 --> 00:13:30,671
YOU FEEL THAT WAY

442
00:13:30,775 --> 00:13:33,088
BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN INVOLVED.

443
00:13:33,191 --> 00:13:33,813
YOU'RE MAKING THE CAKE

444
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:36,022
AND EVERYTHING.

445
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:47,896
>> WHY DO YOU BRING THAT UP

446
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:50,001
EVERY TIME?

447
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:53,625
KRISTINA--

448
00:13:53,729 --> 00:13:55,489
>> IT KILLS YOU?

449
00:13:55,593 --> 00:13:57,664
IT KILLS YOU.

450
00:13:57,767 --> 00:13:59,839
HOW DO YOU THINK I FEEL?

451
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,221
>> NO, YOU DON'T!

452
00:14:03,325 --> 00:14:04,740
DON'T SAY YOU KNOW HOW I FEEL,

453
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:05,775
BECAUSE YOU DON'T.

454
00:14:05,879 --> 00:14:07,536
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO WATCH

455
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:10,539
WHAT I WATCHED

456
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:12,679
AND ALMOST DIE TOO.

457
00:14:17,201 --> 00:14:18,478
>> OKAY, I JUST SAID I DIDN'T

458
00:14:18,581 --> 00:14:20,652
WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

459
00:14:29,627 --> 00:14:31,629
>> IT'S NOT ANYBODY'S FAULT!

460
00:14:31,732 --> 00:14:33,079
OBVIOUSLY, THERE WAS NOTHING

461
00:14:33,182 --> 00:14:34,390
NOBODY COULD HAVE DONE.

462
00:14:34,494 --> 00:14:37,117
PERIOD.

463
00:14:37,221 --> 00:14:37,980
IT'S JUST SOMETHING

464
00:14:38,084 --> 00:14:40,120
THAT HAPPENED.

465
00:14:50,096 --> 00:14:51,028
>> THE WAY MY MOM HAS BEEN

466
00:14:51,131 --> 00:14:52,615
ACTING IS REALLY STRESSING

467
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:53,996
ME OUT, AND LAST NIGHT,

468
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,549
I COULDN'T GET ANY SLEEP.

469
00:14:55,653 --> 00:14:56,585
I KEPT HAVING PAINS

470
00:14:56,688 --> 00:14:58,035
IN MY STOMACH, AND WITH MY

471
00:14:58,138 --> 00:14:59,657
DUE DATE JUST TWO MONTHS AWAY,

472
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,073
IT'S KIND OF SCARING ME.

473
00:15:02,177 --> 00:15:03,109
DOTTY?

474
00:15:03,212 --> 00:15:04,248
>> YEAH.

475
00:15:04,351 --> 00:15:05,421
>> MY STOMACH'S CRAMPING.

476
00:15:05,525 --> 00:15:06,181
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN,

477
00:15:06,284 --> 00:15:07,044
IT'S CRAMPING?

478
00:15:07,147 --> 00:15:07,976
>> IT'S TIGHTENING UP IN

479
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,943
THE MIDDLE, AND I HAVE PRESSURE.

480
00:15:10,047 --> 00:15:10,599
>> HOW LONG HAS IT

481
00:15:10,702 --> 00:15:11,289
BEEN HAPPENING?

482
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:13,395
>> SINCE LAST NIGHT.

483
00:15:13,498 --> 00:15:14,154
>> I THINK MAYBE WE SHOULD

484
00:15:14,258 --> 00:15:15,190
TAKE YOU TO THE HOSPITAL.

485
00:15:15,293 --> 00:15:16,087
>> THIS IS TOO EARLY

486
00:15:16,191 --> 00:15:19,919
TO BE HAPPENING.

487
00:15:20,022 --> 00:15:21,230
WHEN WE GOT TO THE HOSPITAL,

488
00:15:21,334 --> 00:15:21,990
THEY CONFIRMED

489
00:15:22,093 --> 00:15:23,267
I'M HAVING CONTRACTIONS,

490
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,062
AND I'M GOING INTO EARLY LABOR,

491
00:15:25,165 --> 00:15:25,959
BUT SINCE I'M ONLY

492
00:15:26,063 --> 00:15:27,443
SEVEN MONTHS PREGNANT,

493
00:15:27,547 --> 00:15:28,720
THE DOCTOR'S DOING A SONOGRAM

494
00:15:28,824 --> 00:15:30,515
TO SEE WHAT'S WRONG.

495
00:15:30,619 --> 00:15:31,413
>> HOW WE DOING?

496
00:15:31,516 --> 00:15:32,690
>> WHEN THE BABY MOVES,

497
00:15:32,793 --> 00:15:34,899
IT HURTS ALL OVER.

498
00:15:35,003 --> 00:15:39,973
>> OKAY, LET'S SEE WHAT WE GOT.

499
00:15:40,077 --> 00:15:40,870
THAT'S THE BABY,

500
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:42,527
AND THAT'S THE CORD.

501
00:15:42,631 --> 00:15:43,528
THERE'S NOT ANY FLUID

502
00:15:43,632 --> 00:15:45,703
IN THERE TO MEASURE.

503
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,674
SO YOU HAVE A GROWTH-RESTRICTED

504
00:15:51,778 --> 00:15:54,091
BABY WITH LOW FLUID.

505
00:15:54,194 --> 00:15:55,402
>> BUT YOU THINK HE'LL BE OKAY?

506
00:15:55,506 --> 00:15:57,025
>> DON'T KNOW, BUT THAT

507
00:15:57,128 --> 00:15:58,440
ENVIRONMENT IN THERE SAYS,

508
00:15:58,543 --> 00:16:00,407
"I'M NOT CONDUCIVE FOR GROWTH,

509
00:16:00,511 --> 00:16:01,408
AND I'M NOT CONDUCIVE

510
00:16:01,512 --> 00:16:04,756
FOR GOOD THINGS HAPPENING."

511
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,619
>> I'M BEING ADMITTED

512
00:16:05,723 --> 00:16:07,449
INTO THE HOSPITAL RIGHT AWAY

513
00:16:07,552 --> 00:16:08,553
BECAUSE HAVING THE BABY

514
00:16:08,657 --> 00:16:10,521
THIS SOON IS REALLY DANGEROUS,

515
00:16:10,624 --> 00:16:12,143
SO EVERYONE MADE THE HOUR-LONG

516
00:16:12,247 --> 00:16:15,112
DRIVE TO BE BY MY SIDE.

517
00:16:15,215 --> 00:16:16,906
I'M TRYING TO STAY CALM,

518
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:17,666
BUT THE BABY WEIGHS

519
00:16:17,769 --> 00:16:20,600
LESS THAN 3 POUNDS.

520
00:16:20,703 --> 00:16:22,809
I JUST FEEL LIKE I'M, LIKE...

521
00:16:31,473 --> 00:16:32,405
>> IF YOU WANT, GO AHEAD

522
00:16:32,508 --> 00:16:33,613
AND GO GET A ROOM.

523
00:16:33,716 --> 00:16:34,338
THAT WAY YOU GET THE KIDS

524
00:16:34,441 --> 00:16:35,166
TO SLEEP.

525
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:35,822
I MEAN, IF ANYTHING HAPPENS,

526
00:16:35,925 --> 00:16:36,685
I'LL CALL.

527
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:37,582
JUST KEEP THE PHONE BESIDE YOU.

528
00:16:37,686 --> 00:16:39,619
>> I'LL BE HERE IN THE MORNING.

529
00:16:39,722 --> 00:16:40,861
>> LOVE YOU, KRISTINA.

530
00:16:40,965 --> 00:16:43,002
>> I LOVE ALL Y'ALL.

531
00:16:47,868 --> 00:16:49,525
>> IT'S BEEN OVER 14 HOURS,

532
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:50,526
AND MY CONTRACTIONS

533
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,666
ARE GETTING WORSE.

534
00:16:57,809 --> 00:16:59,018
THE HOSPITAL'S DOING EVERYTHING

535
00:16:59,121 --> 00:17:00,640
THEY CAN TO STOP MY LABOR,

536
00:17:00,743 --> 00:17:01,710
BUT I'M REALLY SCARED

537
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:03,919
THAT MIGHT NOT BE ENOUGH.

538
00:17:06,508 --> 00:17:08,579
>> I'M RIGHT HERE, BABY.

539
00:17:17,829 --> 00:17:21,523
>> OKAY, HOLD ON.

540
00:17:21,626 --> 00:17:23,870
HEY, WHERE Y'ALL AT?

541
00:17:23,973 --> 00:17:26,010
SHE WAS ASKING FOR DOTTY.

542
00:17:26,114 --> 00:17:28,702
ALL RIGHT, BYE.

543
00:17:28,806 --> 00:17:29,531
SHE'LL BE HERE IN A MINUTE,

544
00:17:29,634 --> 00:17:31,671
BABY.

545
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:41,129
>> EVERYONE WENT HOME TO REST,

546
00:17:41,232 --> 00:17:42,199
BUT I ASKED DOTTY

547
00:17:42,302 --> 00:17:44,201
TO STAY WITH ME.

548
00:17:44,304 --> 00:17:45,581
THEY FINALLY GOT MY CONTRACTIONS

549
00:17:45,685 --> 00:17:47,618
UNDER CONTROL WITH MEDICATION,

550
00:17:47,721 --> 00:17:48,481
BUT TO MAKE SURE

551
00:17:48,584 --> 00:17:49,999
I DON'T GIVE BIRTH TOO EARLY,

552
00:17:50,103 --> 00:17:51,070
I HAVE TO STAY IN THE HOSPITAL

553
00:17:51,173 --> 00:17:52,140
UNTIL MY DUE DATE,

554
00:17:52,243 --> 00:17:54,280
WHICH IS OVER TWO MONTHS AWAY.

555
00:18:00,803 --> 00:18:05,256
I NEED TO CALL TINA.

556
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,050
>> HELLO.

557
00:18:06,154 --> 00:18:06,844
>> HEY.

558
00:18:06,947 --> 00:18:08,535
>> HOW'S MY GIRL DOING?

559
00:18:08,639 --> 00:18:10,641
>> UM, SHE'S DOING ALL RIGHT.

560
00:18:12,539 --> 00:18:13,230
>> YES.

561
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:13,989
THEY JUST WANT HIM TO GET

562
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:14,955
A LITTLE BIT BIGGER 'CAUSE

563
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:15,956
HE ONLY WEIGHS 2 POUNDS,

564
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,682
11 OUNCES, SO...

565
00:18:17,786 --> 00:18:19,960
>> MM.

566
00:18:20,064 --> 00:18:22,135
>> YEAH.

567
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:27,727
>> YEAH.

568
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,728
>> I LOVE Y'ALL.

569
00:18:28,831 --> 00:18:31,179
>> WE LOVE YOU TOO.

570
00:18:31,282 --> 00:18:33,319
OKAY.

571
00:18:39,221 --> 00:18:39,911
IT'S THE LAST THING

572
00:18:40,015 --> 00:18:42,431
Y'ALL GOT LEFT OF HIM.

573
00:18:47,988 --> 00:18:48,920
>> SINCE MY HOSPITAL IS

574
00:18:49,024 --> 00:18:50,922
SO FAR AWAY, MY FAMILY HAS BEEN

575
00:18:51,026 --> 00:18:54,857
TAKING TURNS STAYING WITH ME.

576
00:18:54,961 --> 00:18:58,551
[knocking on door]

577
00:18:58,654 --> 00:18:59,586
>> WE'RE HERE.

578
00:18:59,690 --> 00:19:01,830
>> HEY, SWEETIE.

579
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:05,489
DO YOU NEED ANYTHING?

580
00:19:05,592 --> 00:19:09,562
>> ARE YOU OKAY?

581
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:11,357
>> WELL, WHAT DID THEY TELL YOU?

582
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,081
>> HE COULD BE IN THERE

583
00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:13,186
FOR A MONTH AND A HALF.

584
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:14,083
IT JUST MATTERS HOW LONG

585
00:19:14,187 --> 00:19:15,844
IT TAKES HIM TO GAIN WEIGHT.

586
00:19:15,947 --> 00:19:18,018
I'M READY FOR HIM TO BE HERE.

587
00:19:18,122 --> 00:19:20,642
>> WHAT WE'LL DO TOMORROW--

588
00:19:20,745 --> 00:19:21,608
I'LL HAVE TO GO HOME AND GET

589
00:19:21,712 --> 00:19:24,404
SOME CLOTHES, BUT I'LL COME BACK

590
00:19:24,508 --> 00:19:26,786
AND STAY THE NIGHT, OKAY?

591
00:19:26,889 --> 00:19:27,683
AND I'LL COME BACK

592
00:19:27,787 --> 00:19:28,443
AND STAY WITH YOU.

593
00:19:28,546 --> 00:19:29,375
>> THAT'S TOO DIFFICULT.

594
00:19:29,478 --> 00:19:30,479
>> NO, IT'S NOT TOO DIFFICULT,

595
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:31,170
BABY.

596
00:19:31,273 --> 00:19:31,825
>> YES, IT IS.

597
00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:32,723
>> NO, IT'S NOT.

598
00:19:32,826 --> 00:19:33,379
I HAVEN'T GOT TO STAY WITH YOU--

599
00:19:33,482 --> 00:19:34,207
>> YES, IT IS!

600
00:19:34,311 --> 00:19:36,313
>> AT ALL. IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

601
00:19:38,038 --> 00:19:39,005
>> WELL, TALK TO ME, BABY.

602
00:19:39,108 --> 00:19:41,387
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS!

603
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,526
>> WELL, I DON'T WANT YOU ALONE,

604
00:19:42,629 --> 00:19:44,700
SO I'M GONNA COME BACK.

605
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:46,219
>> NO.

606
00:19:46,323 --> 00:19:48,359
>> YES, I DO.

607
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:51,017
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY,

608
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:51,707
KIM.

609
00:19:51,811 --> 00:19:52,363
SHE JUST DON'T WANT

610
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:54,538
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

611
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:00,613
>> KRISTINA,

612
00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:02,235
YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN.

613
00:20:02,339 --> 00:20:04,375
>> [sobbing]

614
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:11,796
>> WELL, TALK TO US, BABY.

615
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,901
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE FOR.

616
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:13,764
WE'RE HERE TO LISTEN.

617
00:20:13,867 --> 00:20:14,523
JUST TELL US.

618
00:20:14,627 --> 00:20:16,629
TALK, SCREAM, YELL--

619
00:20:17,595 --> 00:20:19,632
>> WELL, TALK TO US ABOUT IT.

620
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,859
>> I KNOW.

621
00:20:39,962 --> 00:20:41,032
AND I'M SO SORRY

622
00:20:41,136 --> 00:20:42,448
FOR WHAT HAPPENED.

623
00:20:42,551 --> 00:20:43,242
YOU KNOW, BABY,

624
00:20:43,345 --> 00:20:44,312
IF I COULD FIX IT, I COULD.

625
00:20:44,415 --> 00:20:46,210
>> I KNOW.

626
00:20:46,314 --> 00:20:48,350
EVERYBODY WOULD.

627
00:20:53,355 --> 00:20:55,392
IT'S NOT FAIR.

628
00:21:06,644 --> 00:21:07,507
>> TODAY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE

629
00:21:07,611 --> 00:21:08,439
MY BABY SHOWER,

630
00:21:08,543 --> 00:21:09,509
BUT WE HAD TO CANCEL IT

631
00:21:09,613 --> 00:21:11,097
BECAUSE I'M IN THE HOSPITAL,

632
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,443
SO MY FRIENDS TEXTED ME

633
00:21:12,547 --> 00:21:13,341
AND SAID THEY WERE ON THEIR WAY

634
00:21:13,444 --> 00:21:16,758
TO CHEER ME UP.

635
00:21:16,861 --> 00:21:20,313
>> HEY, KRISTINA.

636
00:21:20,417 --> 00:21:22,488
>> SO WHAT ARE Y'ALL DOING HERE?

637
00:21:23,661 --> 00:21:24,386
>> WHY?

638
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,043
YOU'RE NOT A GOOD LIAR,

639
00:21:26,146 --> 00:21:27,251
SO JUST TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.

640
00:21:27,355 --> 00:21:28,010
>> I DON'T KNOW

641
00:21:28,114 --> 00:21:28,873
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

642
00:21:28,977 --> 00:21:31,669
>> DON'T LOOK AT ME LIKE THAT.

643
00:21:31,773 --> 00:21:32,325
THEY WOULDN'T LET YOU

644
00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:33,050
OUT OF HERE TO GO

645
00:21:33,153 --> 00:21:34,051
TO YOUR OWN BABY SHOWER?

646
00:21:34,154 --> 00:21:36,433
>> NO, I'M, LIKE, ON LOCKDOWN.

647
00:21:36,536 --> 00:21:37,088
I'VE BEEN IN HERE

648
00:21:37,192 --> 00:21:38,400
FOR ALMOST A MONTH.

649
00:21:38,504 --> 00:21:39,677
>> IF I WAS IN THE HOSPITAL

650
00:21:39,781 --> 00:21:40,713
FOR A MONTH, I'D BE BOUNCING

651
00:21:40,816 --> 00:21:41,472
OFF THESE WALLS.

652
00:21:41,576 --> 00:21:42,611
I COULD NOT STAY IN HERE

653
00:21:42,715 --> 00:21:44,820
FOR A MONTH.

654
00:21:49,135 --> 00:21:49,687
>> YOU'RE GONNA NEED ME

655
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:50,516
TO PUT THAT ON?

656
00:21:50,619 --> 00:21:51,171
>> YEAH.

657
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:53,312
>> ALL RIGHT.

658
00:21:55,693 --> 00:21:57,005
>> SO WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON?

659
00:21:57,108 --> 00:21:58,869
>> YOU LOOK REALLY CUTE.

660
00:21:58,972 --> 00:21:59,801
>> DO THE NURSES KNOW

661
00:21:59,904 --> 00:22:01,734
YOU'RE TAKING ME?

662
00:22:01,837 --> 00:22:02,942
WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME?

663
00:22:03,045 --> 00:22:05,807
>> YOU'LL SEE.

664
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:07,981
>> all: SURPRISE!

665
00:22:12,158 --> 00:22:14,194
[laughter]

666
00:22:19,165 --> 00:22:19,993
>> THIS IS MY PIECE.

667
00:22:20,097 --> 00:22:21,270
>> SO YOU GET THE WHOLE CAKE NOW

668
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:22,375
INSTEAD OF JUST A PIECE LIKE--

669
00:22:22,479 --> 00:22:23,376
>> OH!

670
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,239
>> I COULDN'T HELP IT.

671
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,136
>> DANIEL.

672
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,724
>> HA.

673
00:22:26,828 --> 00:22:28,692
[all talking at once]

674
00:22:28,795 --> 00:22:30,590
>> WHAT'S THIS?

675
00:22:30,694 --> 00:22:33,697
"MY MOM IS EXHAUSTED."

676
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:38,322
>> [laughs]

677
00:22:38,426 --> 00:22:39,116
>> ARE YOU MAD?

678
00:22:39,219 --> 00:22:40,497
>> MM-MM.

679
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,187
I'M GLAD.

680
00:22:41,290 --> 00:22:42,222
I WAS BUMMED.

681
00:22:42,326 --> 00:22:46,088
[laughter]

682
00:22:46,192 --> 00:22:47,918
IT WAS NICE TO SEE EVERYONE,

683
00:22:48,021 --> 00:22:48,677
AND IT'S STILL HARD

684
00:22:48,781 --> 00:22:50,058
LIVING AT THE HOSPITAL.

685
00:22:50,161 --> 00:22:51,266
I'VE BEEN HERE FOR ALMOST

686
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,233
A MONTH NOW, AND EVEN THOUGH

687
00:22:53,337 --> 00:22:54,303
I'M NOT DUE FOR ANOTHER

688
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:55,788
SIX WEEKS, MY DOCTOR CHECKED

689
00:22:55,891 --> 00:22:57,514
ON LUKAS' GROWTH AND DECIDED

690
00:22:57,617 --> 00:22:58,480
HE'S DEVELOPED ENOUGH

691
00:22:58,584 --> 00:22:59,757
TO TAKE ME OFF THE MEDICINE

692
00:22:59,861 --> 00:23:02,242
THAT HAS BEEN STOPPING MY LABOR.

693
00:23:02,346 --> 00:23:03,312
>> WE'VE TRIED EVERYTHING.

694
00:23:03,416 --> 00:23:04,313
WE'VE GIVEN HER FLUIDS

695
00:23:04,417 --> 00:23:05,142
THROUGH HER I.V.

696
00:23:05,245 --> 00:23:06,281
WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING WE CAN.

697
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:07,075
JUST LAYING HERE

698
00:23:07,178 --> 00:23:07,869
WON'T MAKE THINGS PROGRESS.

699
00:23:07,972 --> 00:23:08,697
>> YEAH.

700
00:23:08,801 --> 00:23:09,871
>> SO I THINK WE'RE GONNA GO

701
00:23:09,974 --> 00:23:11,459
DO A C-SECTION, OKAY?

702
00:23:11,562 --> 00:23:12,460
>> OKAY.

703
00:23:12,563 --> 00:23:13,288
>> IS ANYBODY GOING BACK THERE

704
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,565
WITH YOU?

705
00:23:14,669 --> 00:23:15,255
>> NOPE.

706
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:16,464
>> OKAY.

707
00:23:16,567 --> 00:23:17,292
WE'LL GET THINGS READY,

708
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:18,258
AND WE'LL GO HAVE A BABY, OKAY?

709
00:23:18,362 --> 00:23:19,087
>> OKAY.

710
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,191
>> DID YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS,

711
00:23:20,295 --> 00:23:20,847
MAMA?

712
00:23:20,951 --> 00:23:21,538
>> NO.

713
00:23:21,641 --> 00:23:22,297
>> ARE YOU OKAY?

714
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,748
YOU JUST NERVOUS FOR HER?

715
00:23:24,851 --> 00:23:25,852
>> IT'S KIND OF SCARY,

716
00:23:25,956 --> 00:23:27,302
BUT I'M KIND OF RELIEVED.

717
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:27,992
>> WHERE'S MY PHONE

718
00:23:28,096 --> 00:23:28,993
SO I CAN CALL DANIEL?

719
00:23:29,097 --> 00:23:30,098
>> THEY'RE ABOUT TO START

720
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:31,064
PREPPING ME FOR C-SECTION.

721
00:23:31,168 --> 00:23:31,962
>> I KNOW THEY. THEY TOLD ME.

722
00:23:32,065 --> 00:23:34,516
I TALKED TO THE DOCTOR OUTSIDE.

723
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,379
>> I WAS HOPING THEY WOULDN'T

724
00:23:35,483 --> 00:23:36,138
HAVE TO DO THIS.

725
00:23:36,242 --> 00:23:36,829
>> THEY SAID HE'LL BE HERE

726
00:23:36,932 --> 00:23:39,072
BY 10:00, 10:15.

727
00:23:44,181 --> 00:23:45,596
>> [sniffles]

728
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,736
SHE WON'T LET ME GO IN THERE.

729
00:23:49,842 --> 00:23:51,637
>> I WOULD IMAGINE.

730
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:52,465
>> I'M NOT HAVING ANYBODY

731
00:23:52,569 --> 00:23:54,605
BACK THERE.

732
00:24:01,474 --> 00:24:02,199
[winces]

733
00:24:02,302 --> 00:24:03,027
>> ARE YOU OKAY?

734
00:24:03,131 --> 00:24:07,480
>> YEAH, I'M CONTRACTING.

735
00:24:07,584 --> 00:24:08,964
>> KIM, SHE SAID

736
00:24:09,068 --> 00:24:10,069
THAT SHE WANTS YOU

737
00:24:10,172 --> 00:24:11,760
TO GO IN THERE WITH HER,

738
00:24:11,864 --> 00:24:14,211
BUT JUST DON'T HOVER OVER HER.

739
00:24:14,314 --> 00:24:17,594
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME CRY.

740
00:24:17,697 --> 00:24:18,318
AND I DON'T WANT TO.

741
00:24:18,422 --> 00:24:19,906
>> AND DON'T FREAK OUT.

742
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:20,804
OR ANYTHING.

743
00:24:20,907 --> 00:24:21,563
>> YEAH, JUST TRY TO STAY CALM,

744
00:24:21,667 --> 00:24:24,014
OKAY?

745
00:24:24,117 --> 00:24:25,049
>> ARE YOU GUYS GONNA

746
00:24:25,153 --> 00:24:25,740
BE IN HERE?

747
00:24:25,843 --> 00:24:26,568
THAT'S REALLY WHAT--

748
00:24:26,672 --> 00:24:27,466
>> SHE'S GONNA BE

749
00:24:27,569 --> 00:24:28,190
IN THERE WITH ME.

750
00:24:28,294 --> 00:24:29,053
MY MOM IS.

751
00:24:29,157 --> 00:24:29,675

MORE THAN ANYTHING,

1057
00:37:04,532 --> 00:37:06,569
BUT I JUST CAN'T HANDLE IT

1058
00:37:06,672 --> 00:37:09,296
SOMETIMES.

1059
00:37:09,399 --> 00:37:12,954
I CAN'T HANDLE KNOWING

1060
00:37:13,058 --> 00:37:14,162

1062
00:37:17,304 --> 00:37:18,822

>> WHAT ARE YOU GONNA TELL HIM

1064
00:37:19,927 --> 00:37:21,204
ABOUT HIS DAD?

1065
00:37:21,308 --> 00:37:22,654
>> HE CARED A LOT.

1066
00:37:22,757 --> 00:37:24,759
LIKE, IF I WAS UPSET,

1067
00:37:24,863 --> 00:37:26,002
HE WOULD JUST BE THERE,

1068
00:37:26,105 --> 00:37:28,280
EVEN IF I DIDN'T WANT HIM THERE

1069
00:37:28,384 --> 00:37:29,971
'CAUSE I WAS UPSET AT HIM.

1070

>> THAT WASN'T JUST NUMB.

1077

>> IT MAKES ME REMEMBER.

1078
00:37:42,881 --> 00:37:45,918
>> REMEMBERING'S NOT ALL BAD.

1079
00:37:46,022 --> 00:37:47,230
GRIEF IS NOT A PROCESS

1080
00:37:47,334 --> 00:37:51,096
THAT HAS A TIME LIMIT ON IT.

1081
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:52,753
>> I JUST DON'T LIKE

1082
00:37:52,856 --> 00:37:54,893

AFTER EVERYTHING

1085
00:37:58,172 --> 00:37:59,518
YOU'VE GONE THROUGH?

1086
00:37:59,622 --> 00:38:00,623
YOU GONNA TEACH LUKAS THAT

1087
00:38:00,726 --> 00:38:03,039
CRYING AND EMOTIONS ARE WEAK?

1088
00:38:03,142 --> 00:38:03,695
>> MM-MM.

1089
00:38:03,798 --> 00:38:05,213
>> NO, NO, NO.

1090
00:38:05,317 --> 00:38:07,561
WE NEED TO GET YOU UP TO A LEVEL

1091
00:38:07,664 --> 00:38:09,770
WHERE WE CAN START DEALING

1092
00:38:09,873 --> 00:38:11,565
WITH THE GRIEF AND THE FEELINGS,

1093
00:38:11,668 --> 00:38:13,394
WHERE YOU DO MAKE GOOD DECISIONS

1094
00:38:13,498 --> 00:38:15,741
FOR BOTH YOU AND LUKAS.

1095
00:38:15,845 --> 00:38:16,466
SO YOU WANT TO COME BACK

1096
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:17,122
AND SEE ME?

1097
00:38:17,225 --> 00:38:17,847
>> YEAH.

1098
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:20,125
>> ALL RIGHT, EXCELLENT.

1099
00:38:20,228 --> 00:38:21,609
ALL RIGHT.

1100
00:38:21,713 --> 00:38:22,748
I'M GLAD YOU CAME IN.

1101
00:38:22,852 --> 00:38:23,611
>> TOOK A LITTLE WHILE

1102
00:38:23,715 --> 00:38:26,407
TO GET ME IN HERE.

1103
00:38:26,511 --> 00:38:27,408
EVEN THOUGH IT'S STILL HARD

1104
00:38:27,512 --> 00:38:28,098
FOR ME TO ACCEPT

1105
00:38:28,202 --> 00:38:29,376
THAT TODD IS GONE,

1106
00:38:29,479 --> 00:38:30,584
I THINK ALLOWING MYSELF

1107
00:38:30,687 --> 00:38:31,343
TO REMEMBER HIM

1108
00:38:31,447 --> 00:38:32,620
IS THE FIRST STEP,

1109
00:38:32,724 --> 00:38:33,587
SO I THOUGHT GETTING

1110
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:34,346
OUT OF THE HOUSE

1111
00:38:34,450 --> 00:38:35,416
TO MEET UP WITH TODD'S MOM

1112
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:37,591
WOULD BE A GOOD PLACE TO START.

1113
00:38:37,694 --> 00:38:38,454
>> HEY, MOM.

1114
00:38:38,557 --> 00:38:39,386
LOOK AT THIS GUY.

1115
00:38:39,489 --> 00:38:40,732
>> CAN I HOLD HIM?

1116
00:38:40,835 --> 00:38:41,422
>> YEAH, YOU CAN FEED HIM

1117
00:38:41,526 --> 00:38:42,078
IF YOU WANT.

1118
00:38:42,181 --> 00:38:46,047
>> THANKS.

1119
00:38:46,151 --> 00:38:47,808
SO HOW HAVE YOU BEEN DOING?

1120
00:38:47,911 --> 00:38:49,327
>> TIRED ALL THE TIME.

1121
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,155
>> [laughs]

1122
00:38:50,258 --> 00:38:52,088
>> I AM TIRED ALL THE TIME.

1123
00:38:52,191 --> 00:38:54,021
>> TODD USED TO TELL ME

1124
00:38:54,124 --> 00:38:55,747
THAT KRISTINA ALWAYS HAD

1125
00:38:55,850 --> 00:38:58,750
TO HIDE HER FACE.

1126
00:38:58,853 --> 00:38:59,751
HE SAYS, "I ALWAYS GOT

1127
00:38:59,854 --> 00:39:00,786
TO MOVE HER HAIR."

1128
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:01,477
>> I DIDN'T KNOW

1129
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,443
HE NOTICED THAT.

1130
00:39:02,547 --> 00:39:04,307
>> HE DID.

1131
00:39:04,411 --> 00:39:06,102
HE'D SAY, "I LIKE HER."

1132
00:39:06,205 --> 00:39:08,380
I SAID, "YOU JUST LIKE HER?"

1133
00:39:08,484 --> 00:39:09,554
AND HE'D GO,

1134
00:39:09,657 --> 00:39:11,141
"[sighs]

1135
00:39:11,245 --> 00:39:12,626
I LOVE HER, MAMA."

1136
00:39:12,729 --> 00:39:14,248
[laughter]

1137
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,663
TELLING YOU ABOUT YOUR DADDY

1138
00:39:15,767 --> 00:39:19,287
IS PUTTING YOU TO SLEEP.

1139
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:20,047
SO TELL ME ABOUT

1140
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:21,324
YOUR SCHOOL PLANS.

1141
00:39:21,428 --> 00:39:22,152
YOU AND TODD

1142
00:39:22,256 --> 00:39:23,499
HAD TALKED ABOUT ALL OF THIS.

1143
00:39:23,602 --> 00:39:24,189
>> YEAH, HE WANTED ME

1144
00:39:24,292 --> 00:39:25,363
TO GO TO SCHOOL,

1145
00:39:25,466 --> 00:39:27,088
SO I'M GONNA DO IT.

1146
00:39:27,192 --> 00:39:28,504
I'M ACTUALLY STARTING IN FALL,

1147
00:39:28,607 --> 00:39:29,436
AND I'M EXCITED.

1148
00:39:29,539 --> 00:39:30,575
I'M SO READY.

1149
00:39:30,678 --> 00:39:31,299
I'M REALLY GLAD

1150
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:32,439
THAT YOU GOT TO SEE HIM.

1151
00:39:32,542 --> 00:39:33,888
>> IF HE'S ANYTHING

1152
00:39:33,992 --> 00:39:35,580
LIKE HIS DADDY AND HIS MOM,

1153
00:39:35,683 --> 00:39:37,547
HE'S GONNA BE ONE HECK

1154
00:39:37,651 --> 00:39:41,965
OF AN AWESOME MAN.

1155
00:39:42,069 --> 00:39:43,035
>> I FEEL LIKE I'M IN

1156
00:39:43,139 --> 00:39:45,728
A BETTER PLACE THAN I WAS.

1157
00:39:45,831 --> 00:39:47,212
I DON'T WANT TO FEEL NUMB

1158
00:39:47,315 --> 00:39:48,869
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE,

1159
00:39:48,972 --> 00:39:52,079
SO I HAVE TO MOVE ON.

1160
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:54,046
I THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT

1161
00:39:54,150 --> 00:39:57,533
FOR LUKAS TO SEE ME HAPPY.

1162
00:39:57,636 --> 00:39:58,361
I DON'T THINK THAT I WOULD

1163
00:39:58,465 --> 00:40:00,018
BE WHERE I'M AT IF IT WASN'T

1164
00:40:00,121 --> 00:40:01,399
FOR DOTTY AND DANIEL.

1165
00:40:01,502 --> 00:40:02,192
THEY WANT ME TO HAVE

1166
00:40:02,296 --> 00:40:02,952
A GOOD LIFE, AND THEY WANT

1167
00:40:03,055 --> 00:40:04,574
LUKAS TO HAVE A GOOD LIFE,

1168
00:40:04,678 --> 00:40:05,333
AND IT'S THE SAME THING

1169
00:40:05,437 --> 00:40:06,093
MY MOM WANTS,

1170
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:07,335
AND IT TOOK ME A LONG TIME

1171
00:40:07,439 --> 00:40:08,785
TO REALIZE THAT.

1172
00:40:08,889 --> 00:40:09,717
>> I'M SORRY.

1173
00:40:09,821 --> 00:40:11,029
I KNOW YOU WERE MAD AT ME

1174
00:40:11,132 --> 00:40:12,064
'CAUSE I CRIED AND WANTED TO

1175
00:40:12,168 --> 00:40:13,825
TALK ABOUT TODD.

1176
00:40:13,928 --> 00:40:15,067
I JUST DIDN'T STOP AND THINK

1177
00:40:15,171 --> 00:40:17,691
ABOUT HOW YOU WOULD FEEL.

1178
00:40:17,794 --> 00:40:18,554
>> IT'S OKAY.

1179
00:40:18,657 --> 00:40:20,590
EVERYBODY WANTS SOMETHING GOOD

1180
00:40:20,694 --> 00:40:22,040
TO COME OUT OF MY LIFE,

1181
00:40:22,143 --> 00:40:23,662
AND I'M BEYOND READY

1182
00:40:23,766 --> 00:40:25,353
TO START SCHOOL AGAIN.

1183
00:40:25,457 --> 00:40:28,046
THIS SPOT IS THE THOUSANDS SPOT.

1184
00:40:28,149 --> 00:40:30,151
I'M SO READY TO BE AROUND PEOPLE

1185
00:40:30,255 --> 00:40:33,051
MY AGE AND MAKE NEW FRIENDS.

1186
00:40:33,154 --> 00:40:34,432
I PROBABLY WASN'T READY

1187
00:40:34,535 --> 00:40:35,294
FOR KIDS.

1188
00:40:35,398 --> 00:40:36,537
IT'S DEFINITELY CHALLENGING.

1189
00:40:36,641 --> 00:40:39,885
[Lukas cries]

1190
00:40:39,989 --> 00:40:42,301
ONE DAY, HE'S GONNA ASK ME,

1191
00:40:42,405 --> 00:40:44,407
YOU KNOW, WHAT HAPPENED THAT DAY

1192
00:40:44,511 --> 00:40:45,995
THAT TODD PASSED AWAY.

1193
00:40:46,098 --> 00:40:47,237
I HOPE THAT I CAN BE THE ONE

1194
00:40:47,341 --> 00:40:48,376
TO TELL HIM,

1195
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,826
BUT UNTIL HE'S OLD ENOUGH

1196
00:40:49,930 --> 00:40:50,965
TO UNDERSTAND IT,

1197
00:40:51,069 --> 00:40:51,932
I JUST WANT HIM TO KNOW

1198
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:53,416
HAPPY THINGS ABOUT TODD.

1199
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:54,244
MAYBE THINGS WILL START

1200
00:40:54,348 --> 00:40:56,454
LOOKING UP FROM HERE.

1201
00:40:59,802 --> 00:41:01,424
>> IF TODD WAS STILL HERE,

1202
00:41:01,528 --> 00:41:02,529
HE WOULD ALWAYS PROBABLY HAVE

1203
00:41:02,632 --> 00:41:04,392
BEEN HOLDING HIM, AND HE WOULD

1204
00:41:04,496 --> 00:41:05,221
HAVE HELPED ME FEED HIM

1205
00:41:05,324 --> 00:41:07,982
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

1206
00:41:08,086 --> 00:41:09,674
HE WOULD HAVE BEEN A GREAT DAD.

1207
00:41:09,777 --> 00:41:11,779
[chime dings]

1208
00:41:23,998 --> 00:41:24,896
[upbeat piano music]

1209
00:41:24,999 --> 00:41:33,076
â™ª 

1210
00:41:39,531 --> 00:41:44,087
>> â™ª GO THESE NINE AWFUL WEEKS 

1211
00:41:44,191 --> 00:41:45,606
â™ª DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GONNA 

1212
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:47,884
â™ª GET THROUGH IT ALL 

1213
00:41:47,988 --> 00:41:49,610
â™ª I'M WEAK, BUT I'M 

1214
00:41:49,714 --> 00:41:53,714
â™ª STRONG ENOUGH TO SEE
