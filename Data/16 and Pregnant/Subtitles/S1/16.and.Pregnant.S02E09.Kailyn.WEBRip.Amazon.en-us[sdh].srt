1
00:00:02,761 --> 00:00:03,831
[laughing]

2
00:00:03,969 --> 00:00:05,522
 I'm Kailyn.

3
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:07,386
 I'm a high school senior 
from Nazareth, Pennsylvania.

4
00:00:07,524 --> 00:00:09,216
Wow.
You look like a princess.

5
00:00:09,354 --> 00:00:10,734
I am a princess, Kendra.

6
00:00:10,872 --> 00:00:12,495
 When I was six months old, 
my dad left,

7
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:14,359
 and I haven't seen him since.

8
00:00:14,945 --> 00:00:17,500
 My mom's always struggled 
to hold down a steady job,

9
00:00:17,638 --> 00:00:18,880
 boyfriend, and home.

10
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:20,848
 She's currently 
living in a hotel

11
00:00:20,986 --> 00:00:24,196
 with her new boyfriend, which 
doesn't leave much room for me.

12
00:00:24,645 --> 00:00:25,818
Hi, honey.

13
00:00:26,267 --> 00:00:27,855
Did you find
any apartments yet?

14
00:00:28,269 --> 00:00:30,996
Well, I'm not going to jump
into purchasing a house now.

15
00:00:31,134 --> 00:00:32,929
I mean, that's--that's
a huge investment.

16
00:00:33,067 --> 00:00:35,414
 If I had to rely on my mom, 
I'd be lost.

17
00:00:35,552 --> 00:00:37,382
 Thankfully, I met my boyfriend, 
Jo.

18
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,349
-You know I love you, right?
-Yeah. I know.

19
00:00:39,487 --> 00:00:40,971
 We've been dating 
for nine months.

20
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,766
 And since I had 
nowhere else to live,

21
00:00:42,904 --> 00:00:44,423
his family invited me
to move in with them.

22
00:00:44,561 --> 00:00:45,597
Are you gonna cut it?

23
00:00:45,735 --> 00:00:47,254
 Since my mom's rarely around,

24
00:00:47,392 --> 00:00:49,118
 Jo's mother Janet 
is like a second mom to me.

25
00:00:49,256 --> 00:00:50,981
Good job. Go ahead.
Keep cutting it.

26
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,432
 Ever since Jo and I started 
sharing a bedroom,

27
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:54,813
 we've been really cramped

28
00:00:54,951 --> 00:00:56,573
 and it's caused 
a lot of tension.

29
00:00:56,711 --> 00:00:58,230
Can you get out of the
bathroom when I'm getting ready?

30
00:00:58,368 --> 00:00:59,542
 And things are about to get 
even more crowded

31
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,441
 because I'm pregnant.

32
00:01:05,341 --> 00:01:08,102
[music playing]

33
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:10,622
 Jo and I used to tell each other 
everything.

34
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,900
 But ever since his parents 
invited me to move in,

35
00:01:13,038 --> 00:01:15,868
 it's like we barely talk at all. 
Especially about the baby.

36
00:01:16,006 --> 00:01:18,423
You never even told me
how you felt about it.

37
00:01:18,561 --> 00:01:20,701
I don't know. Like--

38
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:22,634
-You don't know?
-What do you mean?

39
00:01:22,772 --> 00:01:25,464
When you first, like, found out,
like, what were you thinking?

40
00:01:25,844 --> 00:01:28,295
-You were in denial, right?
-Yeah.

41
00:01:28,433 --> 00:01:30,124
-I showed him the pregnancy
-Nah, she's not pregnant.

42
00:01:30,262 --> 00:01:32,954
I showed him the pregnancy test
and he just looked at me.

43
00:01:33,093 --> 00:01:34,784
I didn't know what to say.

44
00:01:34,922 --> 00:01:36,786
What other options
did you consider?

45
00:01:36,924 --> 00:01:39,271
My mom wanted me to do, like,
an abortion.

46
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:41,963
And I knew my mom
would say that.

47
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,242
So what made you decide
to keep it

48
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:47,003
and have the baby for yourself
and take care of it?

49
00:01:47,693 --> 00:01:49,178
She didn't like
the idea of adoption.

50
00:01:49,316 --> 00:01:51,904
I mean, it's good.
I wouldn't be able to do it.

51
00:01:52,042 --> 00:01:55,356
Did you want to look
into adoption more

52
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,565
and you didn't say anything?

53
00:02:04,331 --> 00:02:06,402
Well, you have to understand
the reason for that

54
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,646
is because this is going to be
a very difficult thing

55
00:02:09,784 --> 00:02:11,407
to do right now
is having a baby,

56
00:02:11,545 --> 00:02:13,063
going to college,
going to school.

57
00:02:13,202 --> 00:02:14,824
I think things will get worse
before they get better,

58
00:02:14,962 --> 00:02:16,101
and eventually they
will get better.

59
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:17,758
Things are not
going to get worse.

60
00:02:17,896 --> 00:02:19,449
-They can't get worse, sweetie.
-They can.

61
00:02:19,587 --> 00:02:22,142
How are they gonna get worse?
They better not get worse.

62
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:24,213
Things can always get worse.

63
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:27,871
 Jo's being really negative, 
which makes it worse for me.

64
00:02:28,251 --> 00:02:29,977
 We're going shopping 
for baggy clothes

65
00:02:30,115 --> 00:02:32,186
 because aside from family 
and a few close friends,

66
00:02:32,324 --> 00:02:33,912
 I'm trying to hide 
the pregnancy.

67
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:35,810
I'm not ready
to tell anybody yet.

68
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:38,399
I'd rather just tell everybody
and get it over with.

69
00:02:38,537 --> 00:02:41,230
I know. But I wouldn't even know
how to tell anybody.

70
00:02:42,403 --> 00:02:43,542
Hi. I'm pregnant.

71
00:02:43,922 --> 00:02:45,372
I would never say that.

72
00:02:46,131 --> 00:02:48,029
I guess bigger clothes
will help cover it up.

73
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,100
 I'm glad Jo's coming shopping 
with me.

74
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,206
 We don't do much together 
these days,

75
00:02:52,344 --> 00:02:54,795
 but getting out of the house 
seems to help us get along.

76
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:56,176
Wanna try it for size?

77
00:02:56,728 --> 00:02:58,523
I could try that one.
I don't know.

78
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:00,801
All right.
Do you think I look fat?

79
00:03:00,939 --> 00:03:02,251
No, I don't think so.

80
00:03:02,389 --> 00:03:04,529
Do you think it
will hide a pregnancy?

81
00:03:04,667 --> 00:03:06,289
Why do you want to hide it?

82
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:09,844
I'm just, like, not ready
to tell people at school.

83
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:11,156
OK.

84
00:03:11,294 --> 00:03:13,054
Thinking, like,
maybe black will hide it

85
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:14,849
because it's supposed
to make you look skinnier.

86
00:03:14,987 --> 00:03:17,058
-Yeah.
-I don't know.

87
00:03:17,542 --> 00:03:18,991
So how far along are you?

88
00:03:19,129 --> 00:03:21,684
Almost--I'll be
six months on Tuesday.

89
00:03:21,822 --> 00:03:23,927
Soon you're not going
to be able to hide it.

90
00:03:24,618 --> 00:03:25,895
I know.

91
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:29,243
Well, I'm thinking maybe I won't
get that much bigger than this.

92
00:03:29,485 --> 00:03:31,970
 Hiding this pregnancy 
is exhausting enough.

93
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,973
 And to add to that, 
I have to take my SATs tomorrow.

94
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:37,113
I don't even know
what any of these words mean.

95
00:03:37,251 --> 00:03:39,080
 I'm trying to graduate 
a semester early

96
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:41,807
 and then study dental hygiene, 
so I have to do well.

97
00:03:41,945 --> 00:03:44,189
 But studying often 
leads to daydreaming.

98
00:03:44,638 --> 00:03:47,710
 Since I got pregnant, I've been 
thinking a lot about my dad.

99
00:03:47,848 --> 00:03:49,539
 His sister had found me 
on Facebook,

100
00:03:49,677 --> 00:03:52,197
 and I've been debating on 
whether to send her an email.

101
00:03:52,404 --> 00:03:54,544
 I guess I don't have 
much to lose.

102
00:03:55,096 --> 00:03:57,789
 Now all I could do is wait. 
Or study.

103
00:03:58,617 --> 00:03:59,756
[music playing]

104
00:03:59,894 --> 00:04:01,482
[phone ringing]

105
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,346
 It's the morning of the SATs.

106
00:04:03,484 --> 00:04:05,141
 I know I should be nervous 
about the test,

107
00:04:05,279 --> 00:04:08,178
 but I'm more nervous 
about people noticing my belly.

108
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,253
Oh my god.
I'm, like, freaking out.

109
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:14,702
I really don't want to do this
right now.

110
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,739
-All the people?
-Yeah.

111
00:04:16,877 --> 00:04:18,258
They're making me nervous.

112
00:04:22,986 --> 00:04:25,437
-Bye.
-Bye.

113
00:04:25,575 --> 00:04:26,990
Love you.

114
00:04:27,957 --> 00:04:29,303
Good luck!

115
00:04:30,511 --> 00:04:33,411
 Standing outside, I started 
to feel really uncomfortable.

116
00:04:33,549 --> 00:04:36,552
 And when I got inside, 
things got even worse.

117
00:04:36,862 --> 00:04:38,554
 I can't focus on this test.

118
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:41,177
 Everyone is staring at me 
and whispering behind my back.

119
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:43,973
 This five hour test feels 
more like an eternity.

120
00:04:44,767 --> 00:04:47,597
 When it finally ended, 
my friends and I went to unwind.

121
00:04:47,735 --> 00:04:49,289
But when we started talking,

122
00:04:49,427 --> 00:04:51,083
 I found out all that staring 
was not in my head.

123
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:52,947
Everyone stares at Kail.

124
00:04:53,085 --> 00:04:54,397
But I feel like they stare

125
00:04:54,535 --> 00:04:56,192
because they don't know
if I am pregnant or not.

126
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,159
We'll be in the bathroom
after lunch and she'll, like--

127
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:00,369
she'll walk in
and people will be like--

128
00:05:00,507 --> 00:05:01,749
staring at her.

129
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:03,130
So I'm like,
I can see you staring at her.

130
00:05:03,268 --> 00:05:05,097
-I know.
-I see it.

131
00:05:05,235 --> 00:05:06,996
If you don't get any bigger,
do you just plan

132
00:05:07,134 --> 00:05:08,480
-on not telling people?
-Yeah.

133
00:05:08,618 --> 00:05:10,033
Doesn't it hurt to
hold in a secret like that?

134
00:05:10,171 --> 00:05:11,483
it's soon for the pregnancy,
like...

135
00:05:11,621 --> 00:05:12,760
But I feel like
I don't even look pregnant.

136
00:05:12,898 --> 00:05:14,210
I feel like I just look fat.

137
00:05:14,348 --> 00:05:15,901
It's not anybody's business
at this point.

138
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:17,834
I mean, maybe when it gets
closer and you can really tell.

139
00:05:17,972 --> 00:05:21,251
People think what they think,
like, but-- It is hard.

140
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:22,943
You know, you could say you
don't care, and then, like--

141
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:24,324
I'm the type of person
I say I don't care,

142
00:05:24,462 --> 00:05:25,808
and then I'll go home
and cry about it.

143
00:05:25,946 --> 00:05:27,223
-Cry about it.
-Right.

144
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:28,258
I'll cry about it behind
closed doors, like--

145
00:05:28,397 --> 00:05:29,432
Same way.

146
00:05:30,571 --> 00:05:31,883
Are you hiding
in your baggie clothes?

147
00:05:32,021 --> 00:05:34,057
-Kind of.
- Why?

148
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,197
She doesn't want--

149
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,061
Are you afraid
of what the girls are saying?

150
00:05:38,476 --> 00:05:40,926
Why?
You're not ashamed, are you?

151
00:05:41,064 --> 00:05:42,549
KAILYN: No, but they're mean.

152
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:44,689
Kail.

153
00:05:51,281 --> 00:05:53,180
You don't have anything
to be ashamed of.

154
00:05:53,318 --> 00:05:54,940
No, I'm not ashamed,
but they're, like, mean.

155
00:05:55,078 --> 00:05:56,390
They were talking
about me today,

156
00:05:56,528 --> 00:05:57,736
and they don't even
know me and stuff.

157
00:05:57,874 --> 00:05:59,082
Exactly.

158
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:00,290
They don't know you,
but they feel

159
00:06:00,429 --> 00:06:01,153
they have the need
to talk to you--

160
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,983
talk about you.

161
00:06:04,812 --> 00:06:05,951
Do you understand that?

162
00:06:06,089 --> 00:06:07,367
Yeah.

163
00:06:07,815 --> 00:06:10,439
Listen, you're special,
you're smart, you're beautiful,

164
00:06:10,715 --> 00:06:12,579
and you're pregnant.
And guess what?

165
00:06:12,717 --> 00:06:15,375
You're going to do it.
You're going to be fine.

166
00:06:16,514 --> 00:06:17,653
OK?

167
00:06:17,998 --> 00:06:19,033
Mhm.

168
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:20,690
Do you trust me?

169
00:06:23,313 --> 00:06:27,007
[kailyn crying]

170
00:06:32,322 --> 00:06:33,634
 I've been struggling a lot

171
00:06:33,772 --> 00:06:35,636
 with trying to hide 
my pregnancy,

172
00:06:35,774 --> 00:06:37,120
 and I really need to talk 
about it with my friends,

173
00:06:37,258 --> 00:06:38,570
 who I've already told.

174
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,330
I feel like it could happen
to any one of us.

175
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:43,161
-It could have been any of us.
-It, like--well--

176
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,784
-I mean, if you're--yeah.
-Right.

177
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:47,303
But--

178
00:06:47,993 --> 00:06:50,237
Did you use a condom that night?

179
00:06:50,617 --> 00:06:52,860
-Didn't--
-That was the one night--

180
00:06:52,998 --> 00:06:54,172
-That--
-Prom night.

181
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:56,208
-Gotcha.
-Prom night.

182
00:06:56,554 --> 00:06:58,072
Prom night '09.

183
00:06:58,556 --> 00:07:00,247
I remember
when you first started,

184
00:07:00,385 --> 00:07:02,214
kind of looking pregnant,
everyone was like--

185
00:07:02,352 --> 00:07:03,802
-I didn't believe it.
-Is she pregnant?

186
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:06,080
-Or is she just fat?
-Or is she just gaining weight?

187
00:07:06,218 --> 00:07:07,599
And I was like, I don't know.

188
00:07:07,737 --> 00:07:09,118
Well, I think, like,

189
00:07:09,256 --> 00:07:10,637
it's going to start to,
really pop out soon,

190
00:07:10,775 --> 00:07:14,054
so I'm not going to be able
to hide it anymore.

191
00:07:14,192 --> 00:07:15,814
It's not really being hid.

192
00:07:15,952 --> 00:07:17,091
Sure, it is.

193
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:18,748
-I just look fat right now.
-No.

194
00:07:18,886 --> 00:07:19,956
-No.
-No.

195
00:07:20,094 --> 00:07:21,130
-You're pregnant.
-You're pregnant.

196
00:07:21,268 --> 00:07:22,821
No, I know I'm pregnant.

197
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,513
But I'm saying I don't actually
look like I'm pregnant.

198
00:07:24,651 --> 00:07:25,962
No.

199
00:07:26,549 --> 00:07:30,001
As a friend to a friend,
you look pregnant.

200
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:32,313
-I'm still in denial.
-I know.

201
00:07:37,353 --> 00:07:38,768
 Since my mom's 
still between homes,

202
00:07:38,906 --> 00:07:40,529
 I only get to see her 
once in a while

203
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:42,082
 when she picks me up 
from school.

204
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,635
Did you see
who I brought along?

205
00:07:43,773 --> 00:07:45,534
She'll come up
and greet you in a second.

206
00:07:45,672 --> 00:07:46,914
There you are.

207
00:07:47,052 --> 00:07:48,502
[cat meowing]

208
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,228
 She's taking me shopping 
for baby furniture,

209
00:07:50,366 --> 00:07:51,678
 which is nice, 
but I'm more concerned

210
00:07:51,816 --> 00:07:53,334
 with her getting her life 
on track.

211
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,716
Are you're not going
to look for an apartment

212
00:07:55,854 --> 00:07:57,062
until you get a job?

213
00:07:57,200 --> 00:07:58,926
I'm doing both at the same time.

214
00:07:59,064 --> 00:08:01,688
Should be there in the pocket
but go ahead and answer it.

215
00:08:01,826 --> 00:08:03,206
No.

216
00:08:03,344 --> 00:08:04,380
 Even though 
they're together all the time,

217
00:08:04,518 --> 00:08:05,968
 it seems like my mom's boyfriend

218
00:08:06,106 --> 00:08:08,039
 always manages 
to interrupt our alone time.

219
00:08:08,177 --> 00:08:09,489
Love you too. Bye.

220
00:08:09,627 --> 00:08:11,283
Do you have any change?
Like a quarter?

221
00:08:11,421 --> 00:08:12,388
Quarters only.

222
00:08:12,526 --> 00:08:14,494
Oh, I don't have quarters.

223
00:08:15,149 --> 00:08:17,427
Oh, Mom!

224
00:08:18,187 --> 00:08:19,844
Oh, how cute.

225
00:08:19,982 --> 00:08:22,674
Oh, I love that.
Four piece floor model sale.

226
00:08:22,812 --> 00:08:25,574
-Isn't that beautiful?
-How much is it?

227
00:08:25,712 --> 00:08:27,610
That's a wonderful price, too.

228
00:08:27,748 --> 00:08:29,474
Can we afford it
is the question.

229
00:08:29,612 --> 00:08:31,200
Oh, that's not the question.

230
00:08:31,338 --> 00:08:33,064
 Price is the question

231
00:08:33,202 --> 00:08:34,997
 because I know Janet and Eddie 
are going to end up paying,

232
00:08:35,135 --> 00:08:36,930
 and I'm always worried 
about being a burden to them.

233
00:08:37,068 --> 00:08:40,036
The baby furniture that they
have is, like, heirloom quality.

234
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:41,900
That's pretty.

235
00:08:42,038 --> 00:08:44,385
And what are their prices like?
Are they expensive?

236
00:08:44,765 --> 00:08:47,043
I don't know what your price
range was that you looked.

237
00:08:47,181 --> 00:08:48,355
It was like $900.

238
00:08:48,493 --> 00:08:50,530
These are probably
around $1,300.

239
00:08:51,427 --> 00:08:52,808
Suzi, can I get you
something to drink?

240
00:08:52,946 --> 00:08:54,603
No, actually,
I'm going to head out.

241
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:56,397
-He's called about four times.
-I don't care about him.

242
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,192
Oh, well, I do.

243
00:08:58,330 --> 00:09:00,470
 As usual, my mom's boyfriend 
is more important than me.

244
00:09:00,609 --> 00:09:01,989
What's the matter?
You seem upset.

245
00:09:02,127 --> 00:09:03,888
Well, because she's always
in a rush to go hang out

246
00:09:04,026 --> 00:09:05,475
-with her boyfriend.
-Oh, stop.

247
00:09:05,614 --> 00:09:06,994
Don't even start.

248
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:09,756
She misses you.

249
00:09:09,997 --> 00:09:12,172
Well, do you want me
to come over Sunday?

250
00:09:12,621 --> 00:09:13,863
I don't know.

251
00:09:14,484 --> 00:09:15,762
She misses
the hell out of you.

252
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,005
=Wants to spend time with you.
-I know. I know.

253
00:09:18,143 --> 00:09:21,630
Absence makes the heart grow
fonder, so let me leave.

254
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,149
You want to walk me to the door?

255
00:09:24,287 --> 00:09:26,358
-Be safe.
-OK. You too.

256
00:09:27,394 --> 00:09:29,534
Always concerned
about her boyfriend.

257
00:09:29,672 --> 00:09:31,363
It's the love of her life
right now.

258
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:32,537
Right now.

259
00:09:32,675 --> 00:09:33,883
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

260
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:35,195
Yeah?

261
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,472
Everything just
don't work your way.

262
00:09:36,610 --> 00:09:37,818
I hate to tell you that.

263
00:09:37,956 --> 00:09:39,544
Well,
what do I want to work my way?

264
00:09:39,682 --> 00:09:41,408
I just want my mom
to spend more time with me.

265
00:09:41,546 --> 00:09:42,858
That's all.

266
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:44,653
Like, this is the time
I need her the most.

267
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,758
Kail,
that's why we're here for you.

268
00:09:46,896 --> 00:09:49,036
No, I know,
but she's still my mom.

269
00:09:49,174 --> 00:09:50,555
I know she's your mom.

270
00:09:50,693 --> 00:09:51,936
I just don't understand
her train of thought.

271
00:09:52,074 --> 00:09:53,316
Like, I don't understand

272
00:09:53,454 --> 00:09:55,008
why he's more important than me
right now.

273
00:09:55,146 --> 00:09:57,838
Like, I don't get it.
Like, why is he more important?

274
00:09:57,976 --> 00:09:59,909
He's been in her life
for less than a year.

275
00:10:00,047 --> 00:10:02,153
She's going to do what she's
going to do no matter what,

276
00:10:02,291 --> 00:10:03,464
and you know that.

277
00:10:03,672 --> 00:10:05,605
She's proven that to you
many times.

278
00:10:05,743 --> 00:10:07,020
All right.
I need to go to bed.

279
00:10:07,468 --> 00:10:09,539
Sleep well, my darling.

[music playing]

281
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:14,959
 Halloween 
is one of my favorite holidays,

282
00:10:15,097 --> 00:10:17,513
 and every year my friend Steph 
and I go pumpkin picking.

283
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:21,103
I want to get one with a stem.
If I find a nice one, you know?

284
00:10:21,310 --> 00:10:22,932
This green one's cute.

285
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,900
If would be, like,
baby's first pumpkin.

286
00:10:25,038 --> 00:10:27,454
So are you gonna, like, do
this next year with your baby?

287
00:10:27,592 --> 00:10:28,835
-Hopefully.
-I wanna come.

288
00:10:28,973 --> 00:10:31,216
I don't if he'll be, like,
old enough.

289
00:10:31,354 --> 00:10:34,047
Well, you can just,
like, carry the baby.

290
00:10:34,185 --> 00:10:35,324
Yeah.

291
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:38,534
How are you and, like, Jo
doing so far

292
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:40,881
since you guys are kind of stuck
sharing one room?

293
00:10:41,019 --> 00:10:44,747
I don't know. We have really off
days where we fight nonstop.

294
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,198
Or, like,
we don't even talk at all.

295
00:10:47,336 --> 00:10:49,062
Yeah.
And it's always stupid stuff.

296
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,167
You guys used to, like, see
each other, like, every day,

297

not be with each other
every single minute.

299

a little bit.

301
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,451
you can just do your own thing,
you know?

302
00:10:59,866 --> 00:11:01,315
I feel like people
don't ever invite me to,

303
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,317
like, parties or any--
anything like that anymore.

304
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:04,871
It's probably because, like,
they know you're pregnant.

305
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:06,666
So it's like,
why invited her since I

306
00:11:06,804 --> 00:11:08,150
-know she's going to say no?
-Yeah.

307
00:11:08,288 --> 00:11:09,669
But they don't know
if I'm going to say no.

308
00:11:09,807 --> 00:11:12,016
-Like, I could still hang out.
-True.

309
00:11:12,154 --> 00:11:13,983
It's not like I can't
leave the house or something.

310
00:11:14,121 --> 00:11:15,502
So are you gonna,
like, actually go trick

311
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:17,331
-or treating on Halloween?
-No.

312
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:18,816
No?

313
00:11:18,954 --> 00:11:20,265
-I don't think so.
-I think you should.

314
00:11:20,403 --> 00:11:22,336
-You have to.
-It will be your last Halloween.

315

We're probably just, like,
chilling at Nicole's house.

00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:28,170
I don't know.
It kind of sucks, though.

318
00:11:28,308 --> 00:11:29,723
Why?

319
00:11:29,861 --> 00:11:32,622
Because it sucks if I just,
show up somewhere.

320
00:11:32,761 --> 00:11:33,796
And they're like,
oh, why is she here?

321
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:35,108
-She won't care.
-She's pregnant.

322
00:11:35,246 --> 00:11:37,248
Or they're like--
it's just a bummer.

323
00:11:42,046 --> 00:11:43,495
 That night, I went on Facebook

324
00:11:43,633 --> 00:11:45,359
 and found an email response 
from my aunt.

325
00:11:45,497 --> 00:11:47,189
Oh my god.

326
00:11:47,327 --> 00:11:49,225
 My dad is inviting me to come 
down to Texas to meet him.

327
00:11:49,432 --> 00:11:52,228
 This is a huge step 
after 16 years.

[music playing]

329
00:11:57,199 --> 00:11:58,925
 I'm carving pumpkins 
with the girls today,

330
00:11:59,063 --> 00:12:00,789
 and I can't wait to tell them 
about my dad.

331
00:12:00,927 --> 00:12:03,343
My dad's sister
found me on Facebook.

332
00:12:03,481 --> 00:12:04,862
-Oh, really?
-Really?

333
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,518
-Were you surprised?
-That's, like, a positive.

334
00:12:06,656 --> 00:12:08,417
Yeah. Because that's what I've
always talked to my mom

335
00:12:08,555 --> 00:12:10,108
about was, like, I wonder if
they'd try to find me at all.

336
00:12:10,246 --> 00:12:11,627
Yeah.

337
00:12:11,765 --> 00:12:12,870
I mean, you've been
trying to find your dad too.

338
00:12:13,008 --> 00:12:14,906
So that's really cool.

339
00:12:15,044 --> 00:12:18,358
So I'm going to go stay with him
over Thanksgiving break.

341
00:12:20,222 --> 00:12:21,637
-So it's not just him.
---a sister.

342
00:12:21,775 --> 00:12:22,914
-You're meeting everybody.
-Yeah.

343
00:12:23,052 --> 00:12:24,295
And then two nieces
and a nephew.

344
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:25,883
And like, that's
his entire family.

345
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:27,919
-Are you excited?
-Yeah.

346
00:12:28,057 --> 00:12:29,369
Like, I'm excited, but
it's like,

347
00:12:29,507 --> 00:12:31,060
what if we don't have
anything in common?

348
00:12:31,198 --> 00:12:32,752
I'm sure you will,
he's your dad.

349
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,236
Yeah.

350
00:12:34,374 --> 00:12:35,893
And it's going to feel
a little awkward at first

351
00:12:36,031 --> 00:12:37,377
because this is your first time
meeting him.

352
00:12:37,515 --> 00:12:38,861
-Are you going to cry?
-I'll probably cry, yeah.

353
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:39,966
[laughter]

354
00:12:40,104 --> 00:12:42,382
[wistful music]

355
00:12:45,523 --> 00:12:47,663
-Jo?
-What?

356
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:49,838
Can you help me?
I guess not.

357
00:12:49,976 --> 00:12:51,598
I don't have pants on.

358
00:12:51,736 --> 00:12:54,912
Sharing one small bedroom
is hard for a teenage couple.

359
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,086
I always feel like I'm
invading Jo's space,

360
00:12:57,224 --> 00:12:59,399
but I have nowhere else to go.

361
00:13:00,331 --> 00:13:02,057
We're, like, not even
talking right now.

362
00:13:02,195 --> 00:13:03,403
I don't know what--

363
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:05,267
He doesn't want
to do anything, so--

364
00:13:05,405 --> 00:13:07,545
What did you guys do
before you guys started--

365
00:13:07,683 --> 00:13:08,995
when you were dating?

366
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:10,928
-Going to movies a lot.
-Yeah.

367
00:13:11,066 --> 00:13:12,170
What?

368
00:13:12,308 --> 00:13:13,931
-He said, yeah, we did.
-See?

369
00:13:14,069 --> 00:13:15,449
This is what he does.
He shuts me out.

370
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:17,313
Like, I'm not going
to try anymore.

371
00:13:17,451 --> 00:13:18,728
He doesn't want to go out and
do anything ever, and he--

372
00:13:18,867 --> 00:13:20,454
Kailyn, don't get--

373
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:21,904
He's like, well, it's Sunday.
I don't want to do anything.

374
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:23,112
He doesn't want to
do anything ever.

375
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,562
Kailyn, don't get upset.

376
00:13:25,218 --> 00:13:27,151
Well, I'm tired of it.

377
00:13:28,566 --> 00:13:30,533
When the baby comes,
it can only get worse.

378
00:13:30,671 --> 00:13:32,156
We can't sit here
and deal all that either.

379
00:13:32,294 --> 00:13:33,778
Oh, I'm sure as hell not.

380
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:35,469
Well, I keep telling him,

381
00:13:35,607 --> 00:13:37,023
if this is how it's going to
be, I don't have to be here.

382
00:13:37,161 --> 00:13:40,474
I can figure out
somewhere else to go.

383
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:43,408
Got to go talk to him.

384
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,687
Kailyn is in a very
sensitive situation.

385
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:49,794
You have to be a little bit
more receptive and understand.

386
00:13:49,932 --> 00:13:51,175
I do understand.
I don't--what--

387
00:13:51,313 --> 00:13:52,659
OK, but why won't
you talk to her?

388
00:13:52,797 --> 00:13:53,902
You go walking right past her,

389
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:55,179
you don't even say
anything to her.

390
00:13:55,317 --> 00:13:57,319
OK, what is there to say now?

391
00:13:57,457 --> 00:13:59,252
-What is there to say?
-How are you going to--

392
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,978
OK, I'm trying
to help her out.

393
00:14:01,116 --> 00:14:02,117
I'm--

394
00:14:02,255 --> 00:14:03,843
How are you helping her out?

395
00:14:03,981 --> 00:14:07,087
So she's not a single mother?
That's not helping her out?

396
00:14:07,225 --> 00:14:09,193
I'm sacrificing a lot,
and all she does

397
00:14:09,331 --> 00:14:11,091
-is complain about me, so--
-And you know what?

398
00:14:11,229 --> 00:14:12,575
It is your responsibility
and your duty to--

399
00:14:12,713 --> 00:14:14,163
I guess I don't
need to be here if all

400
00:14:14,301 --> 00:14:15,751
-I'm going to be doing is--
-Excuse me.

401
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:17,339
It is your responsibility
and your duty to sacrifice,

402
00:14:17,477 --> 00:14:19,306
because you are the father
of that child.

403
00:14:19,444 --> 00:14:20,998
-It was your decision to make.
-Yeah.

404
00:14:21,136 --> 00:14:22,827
-Her decision.
-Ooh.

405
00:14:22,965 --> 00:14:24,760
Her decision, Jonathan?

406
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:26,037
Hold it.

407
00:14:26,175 --> 00:14:28,729
Jo, you're rolling
the wrong way.

408
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,386
You really are.

409
00:14:30,524 --> 00:14:32,906
-The wrong thing to say.
-Her decision, Jonathan?

410
00:14:33,044 --> 00:14:34,011
Don't say that.

411
00:14:34,149 --> 00:14:35,219
It ain't right, bro.

412
00:14:35,357 --> 00:14:36,910
No, it's not.

413
00:14:37,048 --> 00:14:39,637
I decided to keep the baby
because that's what she wanted

414
00:14:39,775 --> 00:14:41,535
and I'm going to
support her on that.

415
00:14:41,673 --> 00:14:43,986
I'm not going to just leave
her with the baby by herself.

416
00:14:44,124 --> 00:14:45,401
It takes a lot more than that.

417
00:14:45,815 --> 00:14:49,095
You have to have some type
of emotional

418
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:51,131
and physical involvement
in what she does

419
00:14:51,269 --> 00:14:53,513
and what you do,
the both of you together.

420
00:14:54,583 --> 00:14:56,136
Because you have to get along.

421
00:14:56,274 --> 00:14:58,276
Whether you stay with her for
the rest of your life or not,

422
00:14:58,414 --> 00:15:00,002
she's the mother of your child.

423
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,418
You're going to have to live
with it for the rest of your--

to agree on anything.

We're not even on the same page

428
00:15:24,406 --> 00:15:25,752
about finding
out the baby's sex.

429
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:27,857
So we're going to find
out the sex this time?

430
00:15:27,996 --> 00:15:29,238
No.

431
00:15:29,376 --> 00:15:30,930
Why not?

432
00:15:31,068 --> 00:15:32,517
Because it's more fun
if we don't know.

I don't want to know the sex,

coming over tonight,

calm him down a little.

to leave those with you?

00:18:16,198 --> 00:18:18,269
I'm sure there's tons of things
that you want to do for me,

511
00:18:18,407 --> 00:18:20,513
-but you can't.
-Exactly.

512
00:18:20,651 --> 00:18:22,480
I just don't want you
going there

513
00:18:22,618 --> 00:18:24,689
with really high expectations.

514
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:27,278
 I know I shouldn't 
get my hopes up,

515
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:28,762
 but I can't help but fantasize

516
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,971
 about finally 
having a dad in my life.

517
00:18:32,525 --> 00:18:34,182
I want to get Jo's take on this.

518
00:18:34,561 --> 00:18:36,287
What if it, like, goes awful?

519
00:18:36,805 --> 00:18:39,911
It won't
It'll be all good. Trust me.

520
00:18:40,049 --> 00:18:42,190
More options for the future,
maybe.

521
00:18:42,328 --> 00:18:44,053
What do you mean,
more options for my future?

522
00:18:44,192 --> 00:18:46,159
I don't know.
If we ever broke up,

523
00:18:46,297 --> 00:18:48,161
then you could go live
with your dad or something.

524
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:51,544
You would be OK with me taking
the baby all the way to Texas?

525
00:18:51,682 --> 00:18:53,062
I didn't say you
were taking the baby.

526
00:18:53,201 --> 00:18:54,305
But I would be.

527
00:18:54,443 --> 00:18:55,617
-You wouldn't be.
-Yeah, I would.

528
00:18:55,755 --> 00:18:57,515
Take me to court, bitch.
I'll win.

529
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,276
Why would you even say that?

530
00:18:59,414 --> 00:19:01,657
Jo's so negative, and he always
wants to check out.

531
00:19:01,795 --> 00:19:03,349
I want to talk to him
about it,

532
00:19:03,487 --> 00:19:06,248
but he decided to go pick up
his friend Carlos from work.

533
00:19:06,386 --> 00:19:07,698
Are you leaving now?

534
00:19:07,905 --> 00:19:10,010
-Oh, my god.
-What?

535
00:19:12,979 --> 00:19:15,430
-What happened now?
-Nothing happened.

536
00:19:15,568 --> 00:19:17,086
So why--

537
00:19:17,225 --> 00:19:18,467
I just asked him to spend
time with me for a little bit

538
00:19:18,605 --> 00:19:20,124
and he wants to leave.

539
00:19:21,539 --> 00:19:23,162
We're going through
a lot right now.

540
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,888
Is it really that important for
you to go hang out with him?

541
00:19:26,026 --> 00:19:27,614
Do you understand
why I want you here?

542
00:19:27,752 --> 00:19:29,582
I just don't feel the same way.

00:19:39,592 --> 00:19:40,903
What's wrong with Jo?

545
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,664
He's saying
that he don't want to be here,

546
00:19:42,802 --> 00:19:43,941
-like we're--
-Wait, wait, wait.

547
00:19:44,079 --> 00:19:45,425
Like we're somewhere
in his way, or--

548
00:19:45,563 --> 00:19:46,806
Where are you going?
Jo?

549
00:19:46,944 --> 00:19:48,428
-What?
-Come here.

550
00:19:48,773 --> 00:19:51,845
You have some [bleep] going
on here you need to attend to.

551
00:19:51,983 --> 00:19:53,709
It is your responsibility.

552
00:19:53,847 --> 00:19:56,298
Finish your business here first.
Be a man about it.

553
00:19:56,436 --> 00:19:58,231
And then you go do whatever
the hell you have to do.

554
00:19:58,369 --> 00:20:00,337
She gets upset over nothing.
Like, I'm coming back.

555
00:20:00,475 --> 00:20:02,062
Because I just want you to
be nice to me

556
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,547
and you're leaving!
And I haven't spent time--

557
00:20:03,685 --> 00:20:04,927
I'm [bleep] coming right back.

558
00:20:05,065 --> 00:20:06,515
-No, you're not!
-I don't understand.

559
00:20:06,653 --> 00:20:08,586
You just told me you were
going to hang out with Carlos.

560
00:20:08,724 --> 00:20:12,728
Why is he so important that you
can't fix things with me first?

561
00:20:12,866 --> 00:20:14,143
You always put him first.

562
00:20:14,282 --> 00:20:15,800
You never put me first
in front of him.

563
00:20:15,938 --> 00:20:17,664
What the [bleep]
are you talking about?

564
00:20:17,802 --> 00:20:19,390
-Exactly what she just said.
-You--

565
00:20:19,528 --> 00:20:20,874
I put who first.

566
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:22,428
You are going to work
things out with Kail,

567
00:20:22,566 --> 00:20:25,120
spend time with her.
That's all she's asking for.

568
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:26,708
She don't ask you
for nothing else.

569
00:20:26,846 --> 00:20:28,468
I [bleep] live with her.
What do you mean--

570
00:20:28,606 --> 00:20:30,436
-But we never hang out!
-But you're never together.

571
00:20:30,574 --> 00:20:32,610
You used to hang out
with her all the time.

572
00:20:32,748 --> 00:20:34,129
I'm telling you as your mother,

573
00:20:34,267 --> 00:20:36,338
what you're doing
right this minute is not right.

574
00:20:36,476 --> 00:20:37,753
What do you want me to do,

575
00:20:37,891 --> 00:20:39,652
[bleep]
go to sleep with her right now?

576
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,412
No. That's not what
I want you to do.

577
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,138
I work and I stay--

578
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:44,622
And you never hang out
with me when you can!

579
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,934
And I go to sleep
during the day.

580
00:20:46,072 --> 00:20:47,349
You're always out
doing other things!

581
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:49,455
You told him
you'd give him a ride home?

582
00:20:49,593 --> 00:20:51,042
Yes.

583
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:52,389
Knowing that you had a
responsibility here tonight?

584
00:20:52,527 --> 00:20:54,805
I think he can walk
home tonight, too.

585
00:20:54,943 --> 00:20:56,496
That's ridiculous.

586
00:20:56,634 --> 00:20:57,980
Come on.

587
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,534

I want you to know,

that dad and I
are still here for you, OK?

595
00:21:18,656 --> 00:21:22,729
That doesn't make me feel
any better about him, though.

596

I still have to
sleep in his bed.

This is your bed now.

598
00:21:27,424 --> 00:21:29,874
He gave up his rights
when he did what he did.

I don't know what I did--

to talk to him, OK?

00:25:06,263 --> 00:25:07,816
Just didn't know when.

682
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:11,820
Do you plan on being
around when the baby is born?

683
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,237
The only drawback about that is,

684
00:25:15,893 --> 00:25:18,240
you don't ever know
when it's coming.

685
00:25:21,036 --> 00:25:23,245
You think you'll be
around more often now?

686
00:25:27,249 --> 00:25:29,942
 This is not exactly 
the father-daughter reunion

687
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,530
 I was hoping for.

688
00:25:33,186 --> 00:25:35,326
 -Hi.
-Hi, Janet?

689
00:25:35,464 --> 00:25:37,052
 What's the matter?

690
00:25:37,190 --> 00:25:38,433
I want to come home.

691
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:39,848
 What happened?

692
00:25:39,986 --> 00:25:41,125
Nothing.

693
00:25:41,263 --> 00:25:42,437
 Why do you want to come home?

694
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:43,990
I don't like it here.

695
00:25:44,232 --> 00:25:46,061
 Why is it that you 
don't like it there?

696
00:25:46,199 --> 00:25:48,616
I don't know, it's just not
what I thought it would be.

697
00:25:48,754 --> 00:25:49,996
 You've got to hang 
in there,

698
00:25:50,134 --> 00:25:51,757
 because you can't 
leave right now.

699
00:25:51,895 --> 00:25:53,552
It's just weird.

700
00:25:59,972 --> 00:26:02,561
 I mean, he's your dad. 
You gotta try, OK?

701
00:26:02,699 --> 00:26:03,631
OK.

702
00:26:03,769 --> 00:26:05,529
 -All right.
-Bye.

703
00:26:06,012 --> 00:26:07,704
 ♪ Now all is said and done ♪

704
00:26:07,842 --> 00:26:11,673
 ♪ I'm not the one 
You thought you wanted ♪

705
00:26:12,053 --> 00:26:13,606
 I guess it's safe to say

706
00:26:13,744 --> 00:26:15,608
 to say I didn't find 
what I was looking for here.

707
00:26:24,513 --> 00:26:26,515
Oh, there she goes,
there goes Kail.

708
00:26:26,654 --> 00:26:28,069
I didn't know where to go.

709
00:26:28,207 --> 00:26:29,933
 Meeting my dad 
did not go how I expected,

710
00:26:30,071 --> 00:26:32,245
 but I've got to say, 
I'm pretty happy to be back.

711
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:34,109
How was all week, overall?

712
00:26:34,247 --> 00:26:35,214
Did you have a good time?

713
00:26:35,352 --> 00:26:36,698
It was all right.

714
00:26:36,836 --> 00:26:38,838
-It was all right?
-I probably won't go back.

715
00:26:41,634 --> 00:26:43,291
 My trip was a major letdown,

716
00:26:43,429 --> 00:26:46,466
 but the time away seems to have 
been really good for Jo and I.

717
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,710
And we're featuring
warm brownie

718
00:26:48,848 --> 00:26:51,195
with vanilla ice cream,
whipped cream,

719
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:52,783
and it's drizzled
in chocolate and caramel.

720
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:54,095
-Can I have that?
-That sounds good for me.

721
00:26:54,233 --> 00:26:55,544
[laughter]

722
00:26:55,924 --> 00:26:57,546
OK, I'll get this going.

723
00:26:57,685 --> 00:26:59,514
Are we going to keep
fighting when the baby comes?

724
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:01,827
Oh, I think we'll
be fine, love.

725
00:27:02,344 --> 00:27:04,105
The baby's going to come,

726
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:06,625
we're going to have
our own little family.

727
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,455
It'll be all right.

728
00:27:09,593 --> 00:27:11,595
Times are changing.

729
00:27:14,805 --> 00:27:16,255
 Times are changing.

730
00:27:16,393 --> 00:27:17,946
 I'm scheduled to be 
done with high school

731
00:27:18,084 --> 00:27:19,638
 before I give birth,

732
00:27:19,776 --> 00:27:20,915
 so I'm going to tour 
our community college today.

733
00:27:21,053 --> 00:27:22,675
 Jo was going to 
come with me,

734
00:27:22,813 --> 00:27:24,194
 but he just got 
called into work,

735
00:27:24,332 --> 00:27:26,161
 so I'm hoping my mom 
can come instead.

736
00:27:26,299 --> 00:27:28,336
-Hi, mom. 
-Hi.

737
00:27:28,474 --> 00:27:29,855
I know it's kind
of short notice,

738
00:27:29,993 --> 00:27:35,723
but I have a tour set up
at NAC today to tour the campus.

739
00:27:35,861 --> 00:27:37,552
I didn't know if you
would want to go with me

740
00:27:37,690 --> 00:27:39,071
so I don't go by myself.

741
00:27:40,797 --> 00:27:42,212
 I can't right now.

742
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:44,455
 I'm in the middle of 
a major application

743
00:27:44,593 --> 00:27:45,560
 here on the computer.

744
00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:47,320
 It's, like, 75 questions.

745
00:27:47,458 --> 00:27:49,806
The whole thing is, I just
don't want to go by myself.

746
00:27:49,944 --> 00:27:52,532
I don't even know what
questions to ask and stuff.

747
00:27:57,192 --> 00:28:00,679
All right, well, I mean, good
luck, I guess, I don't know.

748
00:28:01,472 --> 00:28:03,129
OK, bye.

749
00:28:03,612 --> 00:28:04,993
Are you crying?

750
00:28:05,131 --> 00:28:07,409
I wanted my mom to go
with me, but she can't.

751
00:28:07,547 --> 00:28:09,066
I'm sorry.

752
00:28:09,204 --> 00:28:11,793
Should I ask about the
financial aid and stuff, or no?

753
00:28:11,931 --> 00:28:13,415
Just anything
you want to know.

754
00:28:13,553 --> 00:28:15,072
-Just ask.
-I don't want to ask.

755
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:17,109
-Like, I'm embarrassed.
-Don't be embarrassed.

756
00:28:17,247 --> 00:28:19,905
You have to take anything
you can get right now.

757
00:28:21,147 --> 00:28:22,459
Love you.

758
00:28:24,323 --> 00:28:26,912
Trying to get into
college is scary enough.

759
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:29,328
Figuring it out on my
own is even scarier.

760
00:28:29,466 --> 00:28:30,674
-Kailyn?
-Yeah.

761
00:28:30,812 --> 00:28:32,400
-Hi, I'm Jim McCarthy.
-Hi. How are you?

762
00:28:32,538 --> 00:28:33,539
-Nice to meet you.
-Hi, I'm Amber.

763
00:28:33,677 --> 00:28:34,954
-Nice to meet you.
-Great.

764
00:28:35,092 --> 00:28:36,784
-Thanks for coming.
-Yeah. I'm excited.

765
00:28:36,922 --> 00:28:38,268
We're going to take
you around on a tour.

766
00:28:38,786 --> 00:28:39,994
What major are
you interested in?

767
00:28:40,132 --> 00:28:41,443
-Dental hygiene.
-Dental hygiene, great.

768
00:28:41,581 --> 00:28:43,031
All right.
Well, we'll get started.

769
00:28:43,169 --> 00:28:44,619
-OK.
-This is our fitness center.

770
00:28:44,757 --> 00:28:46,207
It's all brand-new,
as you can see.

771
00:28:46,345 --> 00:28:48,140
Is there an extra
charge for it when you go?

772
00:28:48,278 --> 00:28:49,451
No, it's actually free.

773
00:28:49,589 --> 00:28:50,625
Well, I'm looking
forward to this gym.

774
00:28:50,763 --> 00:28:52,213
We'll go upstairs.
Yeah.

775
00:28:52,351 --> 00:28:53,801
So this is our
dental hygiene clinic.

776
00:28:53,939 --> 00:28:55,457
You'll spend a lot
of time in here.

777
00:28:55,595 --> 00:28:57,183
The dental hygiene
graduates have

778
00:28:57,321 --> 00:28:58,909
been our highest-paid
graduates, and last year

779
00:28:59,047 --> 00:29:02,223
they started at about
$55,000 a year to start.

780
00:29:02,361 --> 00:29:03,776
Right out of the program.

781
00:29:03,914 --> 00:29:05,433
Hope you're in here someday.

782
00:29:05,571 --> 00:29:06,848
Yeah, I hope so too.

783
00:29:08,816 --> 00:29:10,679
Are there other students
that have babies?

784
00:29:10,818 --> 00:29:12,371
Actually, I have
a two-year-old son,

785
00:29:12,543 --> 00:29:15,236
and I found that the college
has worked with me so much.

786
00:29:15,374 --> 00:29:16,651
Is your family supportive?

787
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:18,342
For the most part.

788
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,000
My boyfriend's family
is more supportive.

789
00:29:21,138 --> 00:29:23,002
My parents haven't even
met their grandchild.

790
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,624
They've not been in my life.

791
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,109
They kicked me out when I--

792
00:29:26,247 --> 00:29:28,042
But you're doing really
well though, right?

793
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,422
Yeah.

794
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,355
Personally I do not
regret it for one second.

795
00:29:31,493 --> 00:29:32,632
My son is my world.

796
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:33,910
I'm going to cry.

797
00:29:34,048 --> 00:29:35,532
He seriously
gave me my strength.

798
00:29:35,670 --> 00:29:38,224
Because if I didn't have him,
I wouldn't have anything.

799
00:29:38,362 --> 00:29:39,916
So you can do it.

800
00:29:40,054 --> 00:29:43,091
And we have something in us,
as mothers, that keep us going.

801
00:29:44,437 --> 00:29:45,887
That makes me
feel a lot better.

802
00:29:46,025 --> 00:29:47,751
If I look at other
people that can do it,

803
00:29:47,889 --> 00:29:50,823
then it'll make me
feel more motivated.

804
00:29:51,203 --> 00:29:54,068
I'm really looking forward to
applying and everything now.

805
00:29:54,378 --> 00:29:56,242
For the first time, I
actually feel

806
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,348
like I can see
my future falling into place.

807
00:29:58,486 --> 00:29:59,694
And thank goodness,

808
00:29:59,832 --> 00:30:01,523
because that night,
my water broke

809
00:30:01,765 --> 00:30:02,939
and it was time to find out

810
00:30:03,077 --> 00:30:04,837
if we were
having a boy or a girl.

811
00:30:05,631 --> 00:30:07,012
Breathe, mama.

812
00:30:09,877 --> 00:30:12,258
Relax the legs,
don't tense up.

813
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,848
Don't breathe so fast,
take it easy.

814
00:30:22,544 --> 00:30:25,099
Mom, you have to be quiet,
I have contractions.

815
00:30:25,237 --> 00:30:26,065
OK.

816
00:30:26,203 --> 00:30:27,791
-Over here.
-OK?

817
00:30:27,929 --> 00:30:29,275
You OK, Jojo?

818
00:30:29,413 --> 00:30:31,450
I mean, you're shaking
just as bad as she is.

819
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,418
Just keep breathing.

820
00:30:36,938 --> 00:30:38,215
Stay strong.

821
00:30:39,009 --> 00:30:40,252
Baby's coming.

822
00:30:40,666 --> 00:30:43,117
Pretty soon, you're going to
have a bundle of joy to hold.

823
00:30:43,255 --> 00:30:45,257
-That's right.
-And love.

824
00:30:47,362 --> 00:30:48,432
[laughter]

825
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:49,882
Mom!
God.

826
00:30:51,711 --> 00:30:53,541
No, no.
Keep breathing.

827
00:30:57,579 --> 00:30:59,685
If you want an epidural,
now's your chance.

828
00:30:59,823 --> 00:31:01,204
I want it right now.

829
00:31:06,209 --> 00:31:07,866

I'm having a contraction.

830
00:31:08,487 --> 00:31:09,902
Hold on.

831
00:31:10,972 --> 00:31:12,974
Mom, sign my name on that paper.

832
00:31:13,492 --> 00:31:14,769
You want to push.

833
00:31:14,907 --> 00:31:16,978
Sign my name on the
epidural paper right now.

834
00:31:17,151 --> 00:31:18,669
Kail, you have to sign for it.

835
00:31:18,807 --> 00:31:20,499
So just do it as
quick as you can.

836
00:31:25,849 --> 00:31:28,196
[beeping]

837
00:31:29,197 --> 00:31:31,165
Keep breathing.

838
00:31:32,373 --> 00:31:34,409
No, don't push, no pushing.

839
00:31:35,928 --> 00:31:37,447
I'm having
another contraction.

840
00:31:37,999 --> 00:31:39,242
Ugh, oh my god.

841
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,416
-It's OK, honey.
-Keep breathing.

842
00:31:42,417 --> 00:31:44,523
Can't they just suck
it out real quick?

843
00:31:44,661 --> 00:31:46,249
[laughter]

844
00:31:46,387 --> 00:31:48,803
Hi, Kailyn,
are you feeling better?

845
00:31:49,355 --> 00:31:51,840
I just feel pressure,
like, I'm in denial.

846
00:31:51,979 --> 00:31:54,705
I don't think I'm going
to have a baby after this.

847
00:31:54,878 --> 00:31:56,259
She's in a lot of pain.

848
00:31:59,779 --> 00:32:01,229
Oh, she's feeling
like she's got to push.

849
00:32:01,367 --> 00:32:02,748
-I've got to go back.
-Bye.

850
00:32:03,542 --> 00:32:08,685
Five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten, good.

851
00:32:10,031 --> 00:32:12,482
Keep breathing, good.

852
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,829
-You got to push.
-All right.

853
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:16,106
You're doing fabulous, honey.

854
00:32:16,244 --> 00:32:18,074
Hold my foot, Jo!

855
00:32:19,282 --> 00:32:20,628
OK, honey.

856
00:32:20,766 --> 00:32:22,250
One more, right on top of it.
Go ahead, Kailyn.

857
00:32:22,388 --> 00:32:23,803
-Go ahead, keep pushing.
- You can do it, baby!

858
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:25,460
Push, push, push.

859
00:32:26,185 --> 00:32:27,842
There, you're doing it, honey.

860
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:29,706
It's OK.
It's OK.

861
00:32:29,844 --> 00:32:31,363
[screaming]

862
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,297
Oh.

863
00:32:39,992 --> 00:32:41,235
Ready?

864
00:32:41,511 --> 00:32:44,963
-It's a boy!
-It's a boy!

865
00:32:45,894 --> 00:32:47,758
-You did it, honey.
-Congratulations!

866
00:32:47,896 --> 00:32:49,208
Good job.

867
00:32:50,037 --> 00:32:50,865
[baby crying]

868
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:52,177
Oh, my God.

869
00:32:52,418 --> 00:32:54,075
-He's so cute.
-I know!

870
00:32:54,213 --> 00:32:56,181
Who wants to cut the cord?

871
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:58,217
Oh, baby.

872
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:01,151
All right.

873
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,651
 We're bringing baby 
Isaac home today.

874
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:20,964
 I'm not quite sure 
how to feel about it.

875
00:33:21,102 --> 00:33:22,414
Are you excited?

876
00:33:23,967 --> 00:33:25,210
I don't know.

877
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:26,970
Scared?

878
00:33:27,453 --> 00:33:29,248
You're going to be fine.

879
00:33:32,734 --> 00:33:34,529
 My life has 
taken a major turn,

880
00:33:34,667 --> 00:33:36,738
 and having my friends 
come over to meet Isaac

881
00:33:36,876 --> 00:33:37,843
 only makes it more clear.

882
00:33:37,981 --> 00:33:39,327
How much does this kid eat?

883
00:33:39,741 --> 00:33:41,536
Well, he eats,
like, every two hours.

884
00:33:41,674 --> 00:33:42,779
Sounds like me.

885
00:33:43,711 --> 00:33:46,300
I have to breastfeed,
and you guys can't watch that.

886
00:33:46,438 --> 00:33:48,060
Um, that's what
the pillows are for.

887
00:33:48,198 --> 00:33:49,406
Your put them in
front of your face.

888
00:33:49,544 --> 00:33:51,132
Well, I'm still
getting used to it.

889
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,790
And he's not--because I'm not
producing regular milk yet.

890
00:33:53,928 --> 00:33:55,067
It's just like--

891
00:33:55,205 --> 00:33:56,655
Skim milk?

892
00:33:57,621 --> 00:33:58,898
You guys are so stupid.

893
00:33:59,451 --> 00:34:01,073
I suddenly feel so grown up.

894
00:34:01,211 --> 00:34:03,558
In my life, I don't
come first anymore.

895
00:34:04,318 --> 00:34:06,285
And Jo's realizing that
he doesn't, either.

896
00:34:06,423 --> 00:34:07,976
We've never been more stressed.

897
00:34:08,115 --> 00:34:10,669
And it doesn't help that neither
of us have slept in days.

898
00:34:10,807 --> 00:34:12,740
You going to wake up at
night and feed him for me?

899
00:34:12,878 --> 00:34:14,190
If you don't get up first.

900
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,433
[beep]

901
00:34:17,227 --> 00:34:19,885
[baby crying]

902
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:32,484
A crying newborn is basically
the new soundtrack to our lives

903
00:34:32,622 --> 00:34:35,314
and both of our patience
is starting to wear thin.

904
00:34:35,452 --> 00:34:36,936
[music playing]

905
00:34:37,523 --> 00:34:39,456
[baby crying]

906
00:34:54,022 --> 00:34:56,335
It's definitely
taking a toll on us.

907
00:34:56,473 --> 00:34:58,406
You left the milk out again.

908
00:35:00,339 --> 00:35:01,616
What?

909
00:35:02,997 --> 00:35:04,102
Oh, well.

910
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,862
No, Jo.

911
00:35:06,587 --> 00:35:08,692
I'm really [bleep] pissed
right now.

912
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:11,385
Thanks for that, Jo.

913
00:35:14,181 --> 00:35:15,527
Morning.

914
00:35:17,218 --> 00:35:18,323
How are you, Kail?

915
00:35:18,461 --> 00:35:20,394
I don't even want
to talk about it.

916
00:35:21,257 --> 00:35:22,396
What's the matter?

917
00:35:22,534 --> 00:35:24,018
Because Jo left
the milk out again.

918
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:25,571
It's one [bleep] once of milk.

919
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:27,090
-Just shut the [bleep] up.
-No, it wasn't.

920
00:35:27,228 --> 00:35:29,368
-Stop bitching about it.
-Well, why do you do that?

921
00:35:29,506 --> 00:35:31,267
-Kail, I was a-[bleep] -sleep.
-I don't care!

922
00:35:31,405 --> 00:35:32,544
Shut up.
Don't bitch about it.

923
00:35:32,682 --> 00:35:34,028
You do it all the time.

924
00:35:34,166 --> 00:35:36,582
It was [bleep] mistake,
shut the [bleep] up!

925
00:35:36,789 --> 00:35:37,997
-Cut it out.
-Damn.

926
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,551
Well, you don't
pay for anything anyway,

927
00:35:39,689 --> 00:35:40,862
shut the [bleep] up.

928
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,899
Jonathan, was
that even necessary?

929
00:35:43,106 --> 00:35:44,452
-[bleep]
-[bleep] you, Jo!

930
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:47,145
That wasn't necessary, though.

931
00:35:47,283 --> 00:35:48,698
It was.

932
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,735
 I guess I was hoping 
things with Jo would get better

933
00:35:51,873 --> 00:35:53,427
 once the baby came,

934
00:35:53,565 --> 00:35:55,429
 but now there's someone 
more important to focus on.

935
00:35:55,567 --> 00:35:57,396
-Do you want him?
-Yeah.

936
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:05,749
 With all the stress 
I've been under,

937
00:36:05,887 --> 00:36:07,510
 my mom has barely 
been around to help.

938
00:36:07,648 --> 00:36:09,236
He's so cute, look at him.

939
00:36:09,374 --> 00:36:11,514
 But she did finally get a job 
and a place to live,

940
00:36:11,652 --> 00:36:13,171
 so I'm hoping things 
will change now.

941
00:36:13,309 --> 00:36:14,551
Well, this is a nice place.

942
00:36:14,689 --> 00:36:16,933
I made your favorite,
homemade chili.

943
00:36:17,313 --> 00:36:18,866
Go watch your mommy eat.

944
00:36:19,004 --> 00:36:21,489
Is he sleeping better
through the night for you?

945
00:36:21,627 --> 00:36:23,077
-Oh.
-No.

946
00:36:23,457 --> 00:36:25,942
Did you tell your
father about boog?

947
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,668
Well, I didn't tell
him, but he knows.

948
00:36:27,806 --> 00:36:29,187
He does?
Who told him?

949
00:36:29,601 --> 00:36:31,119
He just saw it
on the computer.

950
00:36:31,568 --> 00:36:33,052
Oh, what was his response?

951
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:35,123
He said something
about coming to see him.

952
00:36:35,262 --> 00:36:36,435
When?

953
00:36:36,918 --> 00:36:38,472
And I didn't really say much,

954
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:41,026
and then I checked my email
yesterday or the day before

955
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:44,478
and he was like, I plan
on coming to see him soon.

956
00:36:45,064 --> 00:36:47,032
When hell freezes over, right?

957
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:48,447
Whatever.

958
00:36:48,827 --> 00:36:50,415
So do you talk to him
on a regular basis?

959
00:36:50,553 --> 00:36:53,625
No, I haven't talked to him
on the phone since I got back.

960
00:36:53,763 --> 00:36:55,178
Has he made any
attempt to call you?

961
00:36:55,316 --> 00:36:56,490
-No.
-No?

962
00:36:56,628 --> 00:36:58,181
That's nice.

963
00:36:59,044 --> 00:37:01,840
Pretty much done with the
whole dad thing, or what?

964
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,842
It is what it is.

965
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:06,224
And believe me,
life's much better without him.

966
00:37:06,396 --> 00:37:08,743
 It's easy for my mom 
to criticize my dad,

967
00:37:08,881 --> 00:37:11,884
 but the truth is, she hasn't 
exactly been around for Isaac

968
00:37:12,022 --> 00:37:14,232
 -or me herself.
-He loves his nona.

969
00:37:15,957 --> 00:37:17,407
Look it.
He's even trying to say it.

970
00:37:17,545 --> 00:37:19,754
He's not going to say
Nona first

971
00:37:19,892 --> 00:37:21,446
because you don't
spend enough time with him.

972
00:37:21,584 --> 00:37:22,895
OK.

973
00:37:23,033 --> 00:37:25,967
So you should probably
stop by more often.

974
00:37:27,762 --> 00:37:29,108
I'm serious.

975
00:37:29,592 --> 00:37:30,800
And I understand that.

976
00:37:30,938 --> 00:37:34,286
Even if you only
come by for 20 minutes.

977
00:37:34,631 --> 00:37:36,875
That's all fine
and dandy, but--

978
00:37:37,013 --> 00:37:38,186
But what?

979
00:37:38,325 --> 00:37:39,774
When there's so
many people around,

980
00:37:39,912 --> 00:37:41,914
it's hard to spend quality
time over there with him.

981
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:44,538
I can bring him here,
but you don't ever invite us.

982
00:37:45,401 --> 00:37:47,851
You need a written invitation?
I don't think so.

983
00:37:47,989 --> 00:37:49,301
So what you want me to do?

984
00:37:49,439 --> 00:37:51,510
Every time I call you're
like, oh, well, I'm busy.

985
00:37:51,648 --> 00:37:53,271
What do you do on the weekends?

986
00:37:53,409 --> 00:37:56,032
I usually work on a
Saturday or Sunday.

987
00:37:56,619 --> 00:37:59,069
You even pass my house
on the way home from work.

988
00:37:59,207 --> 00:38:01,624
-I don't go that way, though.
-But you can.

989
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:04,558
-I can, is right.
-And so you'll come by.

990
00:38:04,696 --> 00:38:06,214
-Yes, I will.
-And you'll help me.

991
00:38:06,353 --> 00:38:09,839
I will but not on Mondays
or Thursdays or even Saturdays.

992
00:38:09,977 --> 00:38:11,150
Maybe.
I don't know.

993
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,428
OK.

994
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:15,154
 It's becoming more and more 
clear that things with my mom

995
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,984
 are never really 
going to change.

996
00:38:17,122 --> 00:38:19,918
 It's up to me now 
to get my own life together.

997
00:38:25,233 --> 00:38:27,235
 To find out what you can do 
to prevent pregnancy,

998
00:38:27,374 --> 00:38:29,203
 go to itsyoursexlife.org

999
00:38:31,999 --> 00:38:33,380
 My life is moving on.

1000
00:38:33,518 --> 00:38:35,036
 I did well enough on my SATs

1001
00:38:35,174 --> 00:38:36,728
 to get into 
the community college,

1002
00:38:36,866 --> 00:38:38,557
 which has a daycare 
program for Isaac.

1003
00:38:38,695 --> 00:38:40,041
 And even though it's not easy,

1004
00:38:40,179 --> 00:38:41,595
 Jo and I are trying 
to get the hang

1005
00:38:41,733 --> 00:38:42,596
 of this parenting thing.

1006
00:38:42,734 --> 00:38:44,736
What is wrong with you?

1007
00:38:44,874 --> 00:38:46,531
 It can get really frustrating,

1008
00:38:46,669 --> 00:38:48,464
 but we're learning to put 
our issues aside for Isaac,

1009
00:38:48,602 --> 00:38:50,500
 and we're actually 
even communicating.

1010
00:38:50,638 --> 00:38:52,709
So I'm kind of glad that
we don't have time to fight

1011
00:38:52,847 --> 00:38:54,159
anymore because of Isaac.

1012
00:38:54,297 --> 00:38:55,919
I think it's more,
we were fighting

1013
00:38:56,057 --> 00:38:58,543
because we're still
getting like,

1014
00:38:58,681 --> 00:39:00,614
accustomed to living
with each other.

1015
00:39:00,752 --> 00:39:02,926
I think that was
more the reason.

1016
00:39:03,064 --> 00:39:05,204
Well, it is kind of
hard to move in with somebody

1017
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:08,380
when you were only
together for nine months.

1018
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:10,555
So you don't think
I nag you anymore?

1019
00:39:10,693 --> 00:39:12,142
Sometimes, but it's not--

1020
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,282
-You don't fight with me?
-It's not unreasonable.

1021
00:39:14,421 --> 00:39:16,561
Oh...
thank you.

1022
00:39:16,699 --> 00:39:17,769
So I put up with it.

1023
00:39:17,907 --> 00:39:19,771
It really is all
about Isaac now.

1024
00:39:19,909 --> 00:39:22,256
But I don't mind,
I really don't.

1025
00:39:22,394 --> 00:39:24,085
Hi, baby.

1026
00:39:24,223 --> 00:39:27,813
 Since I got pregnant, it taught 
me really how to love deeper.

1027
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:32,197
-What are you doing?
-Jumping in the tub with him.

1028
00:39:32,611 --> 00:39:33,888
Hey.

1029
00:39:34,026 --> 00:39:36,097
I think there is a
good chance that Jo and I

1030
00:39:36,235 --> 00:39:40,101
can stay together as long as
we're not selfish,

1031
00:39:40,239 --> 00:39:41,620
we don't fight
about stupid things,

1032
00:39:41,758 --> 00:39:43,104
we realize we have a baby now.

1033
00:39:43,242 --> 00:39:45,866
So we have to work
that much harder

1034
00:39:46,004 --> 00:39:47,385
to make things better for him.

1035
00:39:47,523 --> 00:39:49,490
-Did you wash his hair?
-No, not yet.

1036
00:39:49,628 --> 00:39:50,905
And behind his ears.

1037
00:39:51,043 --> 00:39:52,907
Janet has helped me
through everything.

1038
00:39:53,045 --> 00:39:55,116
I couldn't really ask
for a better mother.

1039
00:39:55,323 --> 00:39:58,568
Even though she's not
really blood related to me,

1040
00:39:58,706 --> 00:39:59,845
she is like my mom.

1041
00:40:00,432 --> 00:40:02,779
And get some rest,
all right?

1042
00:40:02,917 --> 00:40:04,540
Jo's parents
are so good to me.

1043
00:40:04,678 --> 00:40:06,990
And they just-- they treat
me like I'm their own child.

1044
00:40:07,128 --> 00:40:09,510
And I don't know where
I would be without them.

1045
00:40:13,031 --> 00:40:14,239
I think if I could go back,

1046
00:40:14,377 --> 00:40:16,103
I wouldn't have
had sex this early.

1047
00:40:16,517 --> 00:40:18,554
I think I would have
waited altogether.

1048
00:40:18,933 --> 00:40:20,521
This is like room
service right here.

1049
00:40:20,659 --> 00:40:24,007
I think the hardest part
about being a teen mom

1050
00:40:24,145 --> 00:40:25,768
is the fact that you
have to give up your youth,

1051
00:40:25,906 --> 00:40:27,701
your social life
is non-existent.

1052
00:40:27,839 --> 00:40:29,150
I've had to fight my whole life,

1053
00:40:29,288 --> 00:40:32,084
so I'm just waiting
for things to get easier.

1054
00:40:33,948 --> 00:40:35,571
I got it.

1055
00:40:36,054 --> 00:40:37,400
He sneezed.

1056
00:40:38,988 --> 00:40:41,542
I think there's a little
light at the end of the tunnel,

1057
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,406
as long as I keep working hard--

1058
00:40:43,544 --> 00:40:46,892
probably harder than
most teenagers my age.

1059
00:40:47,341 --> 00:40:49,136
Hard work will
keep the light coming--

1060
00:40:49,274 --> 00:40:51,241
keep it shining through.

1061
00:40:51,725 --> 00:40:53,416

Coming up next, Dr. drew

1063
00:41:07,119 --> 00:41:09,363
special you won't want to miss.

1064
00:41:09,501 --> 00:41:11,020
You don't deserve to
be treated like that.

1065
00:41:11,158 --> 00:41:12,539
It's just a bunch of hate.

1066
00:41:12,918 --> 00:41:15,403
And they can get along,
they just don't want to try.

1067
00:41:15,542 --> 00:41:17,371
She really doesn't
tell me she loves me.

1068
00:41:17,751 --> 00:41:19,304
I tell you all the
time I love you, Janelle.

1069
00:41:19,442 --> 00:41:21,962
And I tell you I want you
to do the right thing.

1070
00:41:22,307 --> 00:41:23,688
He was the first guy
I fell in love with,

1071
00:41:23,826 --> 00:41:24,930
and I got pregnant by him.

1072
00:41:25,068 --> 00:41:26,449
Does she need to
just get over you?

1073
00:41:26,587 --> 00:41:27,899
I would say yes.

1074
00:41:28,037 --> 00:41:29,521
I got this for you, baby.

1075
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:31,212
[Audience] Whoa!
