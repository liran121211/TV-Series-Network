[chime dings]

00:00:05,067 --> 00:00:05,900
I'M SAVANNAH.

4
00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:07,800
I'M 17, AND I LIVE IN JEFFERSON

5
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:09,333
CITY, MISSOURI, WITH MY MOM

6
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:10,833
AND MY LITTLE BROTHER, BEN.

7
00:00:10,833 --> 00:00:11,833
NO, YOU GOT TO LEAVE THAT ON.

8
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:13,500
MY DAD HASN'T REALLY BEEN AROUND

9
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,867
MUCH SINCE I WAS LITTLE,

10
00:00:14,867 --> 00:00:15,933
AND MY MOM'S GONE THROUGH SOME

11
00:00:15,933 --> 00:00:17,067
REALLY HARD TIMES WITH HER

12
00:00:17,067 --> 00:00:18,367
ALCOHOLISM.

13
00:00:18,367 --> 00:00:19,867
BUT WE'RE REALLY CLOSE NOW.

14
00:00:19,867 --> 00:00:21,067
I WAS ALWAYS THE SHY GIRL AT

15
00:00:21,067 --> 00:00:22,600
SCHOOL, AND I LOVE TO PAINT AND

16
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,967
DRAW, BUT HIGH SCHOOL HELPED ME

17
00:00:23,967 --> 00:00:25,000
COME OUT OF MY SHELL,

18
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,067
AND I MADE A LOT OF CLOSE

19
00:00:26,067 --> 00:00:26,733
FRIENDS...

20
00:00:26,733 --> 00:00:27,500
>> LOOK AT YOUR HAIR IN THE

21
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,167

23
00:00:29,433 --> 00:00:30,567
>> INCLUDING STONE.

24
00:00:30,567 --> 00:00:31,933
I GOT SMOKE IN MY EYES.

25
00:00:31,933 --> 00:00:33,100
WE WERE BEST FRIENDS FOR THREE

26
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:34,933
YEARS BEFORE HE WON ME OVER,

27
00:00:34,933 --> 00:00:35,900
AND WE STARTED DATED.

28
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,667
>> YEAH, GOOD JOB PUTTING ON

29
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:40,000
THE--YEAH.

30
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,300
>> OUR RELATIONSHIP IS GREAT

31
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,733
BECAUSE HE MAKES ME LAUGH,

32
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:44,200
AND WE GOOF OFF TOGETHER ALL THE

33
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:44,867
TIME.

34
00:00:44,867 --> 00:00:45,667
NO, YOU'RE CHEATING!

35
00:00:45,667 --> 00:00:46,567
>> NO, YOU CAN'T MOVE THE HAND

36
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:47,133
OFF--

37
00:00:47,133 --> 00:00:48,333
>> BECAUSE YOU JUST DID!

38
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:50,200
BUT IT'S NOT ALL FUN AND GAMES

39
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,167
FOR US ANYMORE, BECAUSE

40
00:00:52,167 --> 00:00:53,133
I'M PREGNANT.

41
00:00:53,133 --> 00:00:55,133
[chime dings]

42
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:06,933
SO IF STONE CAME OVER,

43
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,067
WOULD YOU FEEL GOOD ABOUT GOING

44
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:10,200
TO THE PLAYGROUND?

45
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,700
MY MOM STRUGGLES WITH STAYING

46
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,400
SOBER, AND IT'S ALWAYS AFFECTED

47
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:15,067
ME AND MY LITTLE BROTHER, BEN.

48
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:16,133
ANYTHING TO GET YOU OUT OF THE

49
00:01:16,133 --> 00:01:17,233
HOUSE, HUH?

50
00:01:17,233 --> 00:01:19,067
>> CAN I GO PLAY A GAME NOW?

51
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:19,800
>> YEAH.

52
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,067
SHE'S BEEN ON A GOOD PATH

53
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:22,367
LATELY, AND I'M TRYING TO

54
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:24,233
SUPPORT HER, BUT STONE HAS ONLY

55
00:01:24,233 --> 00:01:25,333
BEEN PUTTING HER DOWN,

56
00:01:25,333 --> 00:01:26,733
AND THAT WAS A BIG REASON WE

57
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:28,333
BROKE UP A COUPLE MONTHS AGO.

58
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:30,067
NOW WE'RE TRYING TO STAY FRIENDS

59
00:01:30,067 --> 00:01:31,500
SO THAT WE CAN CO-PARENT.

60
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,800

00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,800
[children screaming]

62
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,467
>> I-I WOULD NEVER BE AROUND

63
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:40,300
YOU.

64
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,533
[laughs]

65
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:43,200
WELL, I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT,

66
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,067
AFTER FOUR YEARS OF KNOWING YOU,

67
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:46,367
I ACTUALLY WANTED TO GO THROUGH

68
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:48,733
IN DATING YOU.

69
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:51,267
WAIT, THAT CAME OUT WRONG.

70
00:01:51,267 --> 00:01:53,200
>> YOU CHASED ME FOR THREE OF

71
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,133
THOSE FOUR YEARS.

72
00:01:55,133 --> 00:01:56,967
NO, YOU CHASED ME FOR THREE OF

73
00:01:56,967 --> 00:01:58,200
THOSE FOUR YEARS.

74
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,600
>> THREE OF THE FOUR, YEAH?

75
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:00,633
>> I DIDN'T LIKE YOU.

76
00:02:00,633 --> 00:02:01,300
>> YEAH, YOU DID.

77
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:01,967
>> NO.

78
00:02:01,967 --> 00:02:02,733
>> YEAH, YOU DID.

79
00:02:02,733 --> 00:02:04,067
>> I DIDN'T START LIKING YOU

80
00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:05,567
UNTIL WE STARTED HANGING OUT

81
00:02:05,567 --> 00:02:07,633
AND WE'D RIDE AROUND TOWN.

82
00:02:07,633 --> 00:02:08,900
>> NOW WE'RE JUST BACK TO BEING

83
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,867
FRIENDS WITH A CHILD.

>> IT'S NOT REALLY WHERE I WANT

85
00:02:12,067 --> 00:02:15,533
TO BE, BUT BEING THE FACT THE

86
00:02:15,533 --> 00:02:18,500
BABY WILL BE HERE SOON AND WE

87
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,567
HAVE HAD SOME ISSUES WITH MY

88
00:02:19,567 --> 00:02:21,833
MOTHER'S ALCOHOLISM,

89
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:25,500
ARE YOU CONCERNED, WORRIED?

90
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,067
>> I DON'T WANT TO ANSWER THIS.

91
00:02:27,067 --> 00:02:28,067
>> JUST ANSWER IT.

92
00:02:28,067 --> 00:02:30,933
>> I HAVE NO SAY IN IT, RIGHT?

93
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:33,100
AND OBVIOUSLY, YOU DON'T EITHER,

94
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,767
BECAUSE YOU'VE TRIED SO MANY

95
00:02:34,767 --> 00:02:37,367
TIMES TO HELP HER TO STOP,

96
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:38,933
AND I KNOW YOUR LITTLE BROTHER,

97
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:41,067
IT AFFECTS HIM DEEPLY,

98
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:42,233
AND IF IT HASN'T STOPPED,

99
00:02:42,233 --> 00:02:43,800
THEN IT'S NOT GONNA STOP.

100
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,500
>> ADDICTION IS A WEIRD THING.

101
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,933
>> AND I UNDERSTAND THAT, BUT...

102
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:52,467
I MEAN, IF YOU WANT TO STAY

103
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:54,233
THERE AFTER HE'S BORN,

104
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:56,767
AND I-I DON'T WANT HIM TO HAVE

105
00:02:56,767 --> 00:02:59,133
TO DEAL WITH THAT.

106
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:01,133
>> OKAY, WELL, YOU HAVE TO KNOW

107
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:02,667
THAT IF IT WAS A CONCERN OF

108
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:03,867
MINE, I OBVIOUSLY WOULDN'T LIVE

109
00:03:03,867 --> 00:03:05,067
THERE.

110
00:03:05,067 --> 00:03:07,367
BUT ALL I CAN DO IS STAND BY

111
00:03:07,367 --> 00:03:08,767
HER.

112
00:03:08,767 --> 00:03:10,167
>> AND I FEEL LIKE SOME THINGS

113
00:03:10,167 --> 00:03:11,767
LIKE THAT DO AFFECT US,

114
00:03:11,767 --> 00:03:13,267
AND MAYBE THAT'S WHY WE CAN'T

115
00:03:13,267 --> 00:03:15,267
GET BACK TOGETHER.

116
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,800
>> THIS IS JUST WEIRD.

117
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:33,567
[laughter]

118
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:34,800
>> OH, LOOK AT THE LITTLE BABY

BOY.

120
00:03:35,567 --> 00:03:37,133
HE'S SO CUTE.

121
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,233
>> ARE YOU READY TO CHASE ONE

122
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:39,067
AROUND?

123
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:39,733
>> NO.

124
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:40,400
[laughter]

125
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,400
NO, NO, NO.

126
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:45,733
>> THERE YOU GO.

127
00:03:45,733 --> 00:03:48,767
>> THANK YOU.

128
00:03:48,767 --> 00:03:49,967
I'VE NEVER BEEN SO EXCITED ABOUT

129
00:03:49,967 --> 00:03:51,400
FOOD IN MY LIFE.

130
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,200
[laughter]

131
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,367
>> WHAT?

132
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:56,367
DO YOU MISS BEING IN SCHOOL?

133
00:03:56,367 --> 00:03:58,167
>> YEAH, I REALLY DO.

134
00:03:58,167 --> 00:03:59,367
LIKE, I'LL GO THROUGH MY

135
00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:02,467
NEWSFEED AND THINK, "DAMN."

136
00:04:02,467 --> 00:04:03,267
>> YEAH.

137
00:04:03,267 --> 00:04:06,633
>> BUT I'M DOING G.E.D. CLASSES.

138
00:04:06,633 --> 00:04:07,367
>> THAT'S GOOD.

139
00:04:07,367 --> 00:04:09,467
>> BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE TEN

140
00:04:09,467 --> 00:04:13,600
HOURS A MONTH, AND IF I HAVE THE

141
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,733
BABY THIS MONTH, I WON'T HAVE MY

142
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:17,467
TEN HOURS IN AND I'LL HAVE TO

143
00:04:17,467 --> 00:04:18,933
RESTART THE WHOLE CLASS.

144
00:04:18,933 --> 00:04:20,700
SO WE DID DECIDE TO PUT IT OFF

145
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,433
UNTIL AFTER I HAVE THE BABY,

146
00:04:22,433 --> 00:04:24,067
JUST BECAUSE--

147
00:04:24,067 --> 00:04:24,900
>> DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE

148
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:25,767
ABLE TO, LIKE, PICK IT UP AGAIN

149
00:04:25,767 --> 00:04:26,533
AFTER THE BABY?

150
00:04:26,533 --> 00:04:27,267
THAT'S GOOD.

151
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:28,767
>> WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST THOUGHT

152
00:04:28,767 --> 00:04:30,067
WHENEVER YOU FOUND OUT THAT YOU

153
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:30,867
GOT PREGNANT?

154
00:04:30,867 --> 00:04:31,967
LIKE, WHAT WAS THE FIRST THING

155
00:04:31,967 --> 00:04:33,967
THAT POPPED INTO YOUR HEAD?

156
00:04:36,133 --> 00:04:37,500
>> I LITERALLY JUST SAW, LIKE,

157
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,767
LIFE FLASH BEFORE ME,

158
00:04:39,767 --> 00:04:41,767
LIKE HOW THEY SAY WHEN YOU DIE.

159
00:04:41,767 --> 00:04:43,467
IT'S LIKE, EVERYTHING YOU'D

160
00:04:43,467 --> 00:04:44,567
EVER PLANNED OR TALKED ABOUT

161
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:45,967
GOES DOWN THE DRAIN.

162
00:04:45,967 --> 00:04:46,633
>> YEAH.

163
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:48,133
>> SO...

164
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:49,300
>> HOW DID STONE REACT,

165
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:49,967
ACTUALLY?

166
00:04:49,967 --> 00:04:50,633
>> YEAH.

167
00:04:50,633 --> 00:04:51,700
>> HE DIDN'T BELIEVE ME.

168
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,900
I HAD, LIKE, FIVE PREGNANCY

169
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,100
TESTS SITTING THERE.

170
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:54,967
>> AND HE STILL DIDN'T, LIKE,

171
00:04:54,967 --> 00:04:55,567
BELIEVE YOU?

172
00:04:55,567 --> 00:04:56,233
>> YEAH.

173
00:04:56,233 --> 00:04:57,233
HE JUST LOOKED AT ME.

174
00:04:57,233 --> 00:04:59,067
I THINK HE WANTED TO CRY, BUT

175
00:04:59,067 --> 00:05:00,333
PEOPLE WERE AROUND, AND HE

176
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:04,067
WAS, LIKE--WASN'T FOR REAL.

177
00:05:04,067 --> 00:05:05,933
AND THEN NOW IT STILL

178
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:06,933
ISN'T REAL.

179
00:05:06,933 --> 00:05:08,200
>> YEAH.

180
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,067
>> YOU DON'T EVER THINK THOSE

181
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:11,400
THINGS ARE GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU.

182
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,467
>> UNTIL IT DOES HAPPEN.

183
00:05:12,467 --> 00:05:15,067
>> YEAH, I MEAN, WE NEVER USED

184
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:16,533
PROTECTION, AND I NEVER--

185
00:05:16,533 --> 00:05:17,800
YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T THINK THAT IT

186
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,200
WAS POSSIBLE FOR ME TO CONCEIVE.

187
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,067
>> RIGHT.

188
00:05:23,067 --> 00:05:25,200
>> SO...

189
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:25,967
>> SO HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT

190
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:26,933
NAMES?

191
00:05:26,933 --> 00:05:28,233
>> YEAH.

192
00:05:28,233 --> 00:05:31,467
BUT STONE IS NOT AGREEING.

193
00:05:31,467 --> 00:05:34,300
IT'S JUST MISERABLENESS

194
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,333
'CAUSE THAT REALLY--

195
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,500
HE WANTS TO NAME THE BABY

196
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,133
THE NAME OF A CAR THAT HE LIKES:

197
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:41,100
TALON.

198
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:41,800
>> [laughs]

199
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,633
>> YEAH, OKAY.

200
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,167
>> YEAH, MIGHT NOT THINK OF IT

201
00:05:44,167 --> 00:05:44,833
THE SAME.

202
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:45,733
[laughs]

203
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:46,967
>> YEAH.

204
00:05:46,967 --> 00:05:48,633
STONE WANTING TO NAME THE BABY

205
00:05:48,633 --> 00:05:51,233
AFTER A CAR REALLY BOTHERS ME.

206
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,767
EVEN THOUGH HE'S WORKING TO

207
00:05:54,767 --> 00:05:56,500
SUPPORT US FINANCIALLY,

208
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,200
I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S READY TO BE

209
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,600
A DAD, SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

210
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,300
TO ME THAT MY MOM IS ABLE TO

211
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,300
HELP ME WITH THE BABY.

212
00:06:09,467 --> 00:06:11,133
STONE!

213
00:06:11,133 --> 00:06:12,467
>> [laughs]

214
00:06:12,467 --> 00:06:14,067
>> WHY?

215
00:06:14,067 --> 00:06:14,767
>> SEE?

216
00:06:14,767 --> 00:06:15,533
WHY YOU GOT TO GET ALL

217
00:06:15,533 --> 00:06:16,200
PISSED OFF?

218
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,733
>> BECAUSE THAT'S IMMATURE.

219
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:18,400
>> SO?

220
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,167
YOU DO IMMATURE [bleep].

221
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:21,633
>> SO YOU'RE BACK--I'M--

222
00:06:21,633 --> 00:06:22,933
>> I CAN--I CAN'T--

223
00:06:22,933 --> 00:06:26,200
>> JUST SHUT UP.

224
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,400
SO HOW DO YOU WANT TO DO

225
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,767
CO-PARENTING?

226
00:06:29,767 --> 00:06:31,233
>> I DON'T KNOW.

227
00:06:31,233 --> 00:06:33,400
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEAS?

228
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:36,467
>> WELL, IT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU

229
00:06:36,467 --> 00:06:37,800
GUYS GOT TO FIGURE OUT TOO.

230
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,467
I MEAN, YOU CAN ALTERNATE,

231
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:41,533
OR YOU KNOW...

232
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:44,867
>> YEAH, WE CAN ALTERNATE, AND,

233
00:06:44,867 --> 00:06:48,167
YOU KNOW, NEVER WOULD I WANT

234
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:50,367
STONE TO FEEL LEFT OUT

235
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,800
AND UNAPPRECIATED

236
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,133
AND NOT A PART OF

237
00:06:54,133 --> 00:06:55,733
HIS SON'S LIFE.

238
00:06:55,733 --> 00:06:57,067
>> I WOULD NEVER WANT TO FEEL

239
00:06:57,067 --> 00:06:57,867
THAT WAY EITHER.

240
00:06:57,867 --> 00:07:00,300
THAT'S A TERRIBLE FEELING.

241
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,767
I MEAN, YOU KNOW I'M WILLING TO

242
00:07:01,767 --> 00:07:03,467
TAKE HIM WHENEVER YOU NEED ME

243
00:07:03,467 --> 00:07:05,700
TO IF, YOU KNOW--

244
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,400
>> YEAH.

245
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,833
>> BUT I'M ALSO THERE.

246
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,200
DO YOU GUYS FEEL COMFORTABLE

247
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,733
WITH THE BABY BEING WITH ME?

248
00:07:11,733 --> 00:07:12,433
>> I DO.

249
00:07:12,433 --> 00:07:14,600
>> OH.

250
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:16,067
>> IF YOU DO, YOU KNOW, YOU NEED

251
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:17,400
TO FIX YOUR PROBLEM, YOU KNOW,

252
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,400
'CAUSE YOU GOT A MAJOR PROBLEM.

253
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,567
I FEEL LIKE A [bleep] SAYING

254
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:22,933
THAT, BUT IF SHE WANTS

255
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:23,967
TO FIX IT.

256
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:25,567
>> YEAH.

257
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:28,533
UM, I'M TIRED OF SEEING MY MOM

258
00:07:28,533 --> 00:07:29,333
STRUGGLE.

259
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:30,767
>> MM-HMM.

260
00:07:30,767 --> 00:07:32,867
>> AND I KNOW THAT YOU'RE ON THE

261
00:07:32,867 --> 00:07:35,567
ROAD TO RECOVERY, BUT THERE'S

262
00:07:35,567 --> 00:07:37,533
BOUND TO BE SLIPUPS,

263
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:41,267
AND I WANT TO HAVE A COMPLETELY

264
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:42,200
SOBER ENVIRONMENT.

265
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,733
>> MM-HMM.

266
00:07:43,733 --> 00:07:47,067
>> I JUST KNOW THAT OLD HABITS

267
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,467
ARE HARD TO BREAK.

268
00:07:48,467 --> 00:07:51,533
>> YEAH, IT IS.

269
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:55,333
>> I JUST--I WANT TO SEE--

270
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,200
I WANT TO SEE THINGS...

271
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,267
>> EVERYTHING WORK OUT?

272
00:07:57,267 --> 00:07:59,133
>> WORK OUT FOR YOU.

273
00:07:59,133 --> 00:08:04,767
>> * ALL THE BLUE EYES

274
00:08:04,767 --> 00:08:07,833
* YOU GOT TO GO

275
00:08:10,733 --> 00:08:12,500
WE'RE ALL GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

276
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,500
WE ARE.

277
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:19,500
YOU KNOW?

278
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:35,767
>> I HAVE MULTIPLICATION

279
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:38,267
TABLES--OR THE FRACTION RULES.

280
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:40,100
EVEN THOUGH I'VE DECIDED TO PUT

281
00:08:40,100 --> 00:08:41,567
OFF GETTING MY G.E.D. UNTIL

282
00:08:41,567 --> 00:08:43,800
AFTER THE BABY IS BORN, MY MOM

283
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:44,867
HAS BEEN HELPING ME WITH MY

284
00:08:44,867 --> 00:08:45,533
STUDIES.

285
00:08:45,533 --> 00:08:47,600
PEMDAS: PARENTHESES,

286
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,633
EXPONENTS...

287
00:08:50,633 --> 00:08:52,333
>> THAT'S LIKE FOREIGN LANGUAGE.

288
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:53,233
>> YEAH.

289
00:08:53,233 --> 00:08:55,233
>> [laughs]

290
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,600
[indistinct chatter]

291
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,133
TODAY IS MY BABY SHOWER,

292
00:09:00,133 --> 00:09:01,600
AND I'M NERVOUS ABOUT STONE

293
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,100
BEING THERE BECAUSE HE DOESN'T

294
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:05,167
ALWAYS GET ALONG WITH MY FAMILY.

295
00:09:05,167 --> 00:09:06,800
>> NOW YOU WALK AROUND HER

296
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,633
AND MEET ME ON THIS SIDE.

297
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:08,633
>> MAKE SURE IT'S UP.

298
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:10,667
>> OH!

299
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:12,267
PRETTY CLOSE.

300
00:09:12,267 --> 00:09:13,533
UH-OH.

301
00:09:13,533 --> 00:09:14,400
>> WHOSE IS THAT?

302
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,600
>> IS THAT YOURS?

303
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,500
>> IT WAS GRANNY'S?

304
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,967
>> OH, SHE WAS PRETTY CLOSE,

305
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:18,633
HUH?

306
00:09:18,633 --> 00:09:19,367
>> GO GIVE IT BACK TO HER.

307
00:09:19,367 --> 00:09:20,600
TELL HER, "HANG ON TO IT."

308
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:21,933
>> OKAY, THAT'S IT.

309
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:22,900
WE CAN EAT CAKE.

310
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,567
OR PRESENTS.

311
00:09:23,567 --> 00:09:24,733
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO FIRST.

312
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:25,400
PRESENTS?

313
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,067
>> ALL RIGHT.

314
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:26,733
>> DO PRESENTS FIRST.

315
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:27,467
>> ALL RIGHT.

316
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:29,367
STONE, DO YOU WANT TO COME BACK

317
00:09:29,367 --> 00:09:31,367
HERE?

318
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:35,967
[gasps]

319
00:09:35,967 --> 00:09:37,300
THIS IS SO CUTE.

320
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,867
>> AH...

321
00:09:38,867 --> 00:09:39,833
>> SO ADORABLE.

322
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:40,900
>> I HOPE HE STAYS THAT LITTLE

323
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:41,567
FOR A WHILE.

324
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:43,067
>> BUT GUESS WHAT.

325
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:44,267
HE'S NOT GONNA.

326
00:09:44,267 --> 00:09:45,433
>> OH.

327
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:47,067
IT'S A MONKEY.

328
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:48,200
>> OOH!

329
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,400
>> AND A PACKAGE OF BABY WIPES

330
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,500
FOR THOSE TIMES YOU GOT TO

331
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,167
CHANGE STINKY DIAPERS.

332
00:09:52,167 --> 00:09:53,233
>> YEAH, IF I GOT TO GO TO THE

333
00:09:53,233 --> 00:09:54,233
BATHROOM OR SOMETHING.

334
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:56,233
[laughter]

335
00:09:58,167 --> 00:10:00,700
>> LITTLE BOOTIES.

336
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,067
>> SO EVERYBODY WANTS TO KNOW,

337
00:10:02,067 --> 00:10:02,767
YOU GUYS.

338
00:10:02,767 --> 00:10:04,100
HAVE YOU GUYS PICKED OUT A NAME?

339
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,800
>> NO.

340
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,800
GRANNY.

341
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,400
>> GRANNY.

342
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:25,533
>> CAN YOU JUST--STONE.

343
00:10:25,533 --> 00:10:27,533
>> DO NOT DO THAT.

344
00:10:29,167 --> 00:10:31,167
>> YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT.

345
00:10:43,433 --> 00:10:45,300
>> WELL, THANK YOU, EVERYONE.

346
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,400
YAY!

347
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,133
[laughs]

348
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:50,133
[applause]

349
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:54,833
STONE, YOU'RE A PIG.

350
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,433
>> [laughs]

351
00:10:56,433 --> 00:10:57,333
>> WHO DOES THAT?

352
00:10:57,333 --> 00:10:59,767
>> HO-HO.

353
00:10:59,767 --> 00:11:01,533
>> TODAY'S BEEN STRESSFUL.

354
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:02,467
>> IT'S NOT THE END OF THE

355
00:11:02,467 --> 00:11:03,233
WORLD.

356
00:11:03,233 --> 00:11:04,800
>> OKAY, I UNDERSTAND THAT,

357
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,900
BUT GETTING MAD OVER A NAME AND

358
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:08,233
THEN GETTING UP AND WALKING AWAY

359
00:11:08,233 --> 00:11:09,467
IS RIDICULOUS.

360
00:11:09,467 --> 00:11:11,633
I'M NOT NAMING MY FIRST CHILD

361
00:11:11,633 --> 00:11:12,433
AFTER...

362
00:11:12,433 --> 00:11:13,200
>> A CAR.

363
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:13,967
>> A CAR.

364
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:15,800
AND MY GRANDMOTHER WAS RIGHT TO

365
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,067
SAY THAT, AND THEN HE JUST GETS

366
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:18,067
UP AND WALKS AWAY.

367
00:11:18,067 --> 00:11:19,767
>> IT'S JUST DISRESPECTFUL.

368
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:21,167
>> YEAH, I'M KIND OF UPSET.

369
00:11:21,167 --> 00:11:22,067
>> AND ESPECIALLY AT YOUR BABY

370
00:11:22,067 --> 00:11:22,800
SHOWER.

371
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,867
>> HE EMBARRASSED ME, AND IT,

372
00:11:23,867 --> 00:11:26,867
LIKE--I WAS READY TO CRY.

373
00:11:26,867 --> 00:11:28,867
>> HONESTLY, I THINK WHAT HE DID

374
00:11:28,867 --> 00:11:29,900
TONIGHT PROVES THAT HE'S NOT

375
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,400
REALLY READY TO BE MATURE ENOUGH

376
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,133
TO BE A FATHER.

377
00:11:33,133 --> 00:11:34,567
>> YEAH, THAT'S WHY WE'RE NOT

378
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:35,800
TOGETHER.

379
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,100
FAR FROM TOGETHER,

380
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,067
ESPECIALLY AFTER TODAY.

381
00:11:39,067 --> 00:11:41,067
>> YEAH.

382
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:52,967
>> HMM?

383
00:11:52,967 --> 00:11:53,900
>> LEAVE IT ALONE.

384
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,300
>> YEAH, DON'T TOUCH IT.

385
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,933
>> OH, MY GOSH, NOT AGAIN.

386
00:11:57,933 --> 00:11:59,367
>> AFTER THE BABY SHOWER,

387
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:00,800
INSTEAD OF COMING BACK TO MY

388
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,067
HOUSE TO HELP SORT OUT THE

389
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:03,600
GIFTS, STONE WENT TO HANG OUT

390
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,600
WITH HIS FRIEND.

391
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,733
>> THAT GIRL RIGHT THERE,

392
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,433
SHE TOTALLY GAVE ME THE "DO ME"

393
00:12:14,433 --> 00:12:15,300
EYES.

394
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,133
>> [laughs]

395
00:12:16,133 --> 00:12:17,400
AND JUST WALKED AWAY.

396
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,233
>> I'LL GET HER BACK OVER HERE.

397
00:12:19,233 --> 00:12:20,267
>> [laughs]

398
00:12:20,267 --> 00:12:21,967
YOU WON'T DO IT.

399
00:12:21,967 --> 00:12:23,500
>> SHE'S TALKING TO SOMEBODY.

400
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,367
>> I'M RUDE.

401
00:12:24,367 --> 00:12:25,200
>> THEY'RE GETTING READY TO

402
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,133
LEAVE, SO...

403
00:12:26,133 --> 00:12:27,467
>> YOU WON'T DO IT.

404
00:12:27,467 --> 00:12:28,400
COME ON.

405
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,133
LOOK AT THAT.

406
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:30,333
LOOK AT THAT.

407
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,967
I'LL GET HER ATTENTION FOR YOU.

408
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:33,300
>> NO, DUDE.

409
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,067
YOU HAVE A KID ON THE WAY,

410
00:12:35,067 --> 00:12:36,433
BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN YOU HAVE

411
00:12:36,433 --> 00:12:37,600
BETTER GAME THAN ME.

412
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,500
>> I--HOW DOES IT NOT?

413
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,900
I MEAN, I'VE GOT SOME PRETTY

414
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,567
GOOD--I GOT MAD SKILLS.

415
00:12:42,567 --> 00:12:43,833
>> I GOT SOME MAD SKILLS TOO.

416
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,933
>> YOU WON'T DO IT.

417
00:12:45,933 --> 00:12:47,133
>> THANK YOU.

418
00:12:47,133 --> 00:12:48,700
>> HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?

419
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,533
CAN I HAVE YOUR PHONE NUMBER?

420
00:12:50,533 --> 00:12:51,367
YOU'RE REALLY PRETTY.

421
00:12:51,367 --> 00:12:53,367
CAN I HAVE YOUR PHONE NUMBER?

422
00:12:54,467 --> 00:12:55,700
>> I'M NOT A STRANGER.

423
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,367
MY NAME'S ROBBIE.

424
00:12:56,367 --> 00:12:57,933
>> HIS NAME'S ROBBIE.

425
00:12:57,933 --> 00:12:59,233
>> THAT'S HOW STRANGERS GET TO

426
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:00,200
KNOW EACH OTHER.

427
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,733
IF YOU GIVE ME YOUR PHONE

428
00:13:01,733 --> 00:13:02,800
NUMBER, I'LL CALL YOU, AND WE'LL

429
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:03,800
GO GET ICE CREAM SOMETIME.

430
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:04,700
>> TOMORROW NIGHT.

431
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,467
>> TOMORROW NIGHT?

432
00:13:05,467 --> 00:13:06,200
OKAY.

433
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,533
CAN WE WINDOW PAINT YOUR CAR?

434
00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:08,567
>> YEAH.

435
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:09,267
YEAH.

436
00:13:09,267 --> 00:13:10,200
NOT THE WINDSHIELD.

437
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,267
>> NOT THE WINDSHIELD.

438
00:13:11,267 --> 00:13:12,133
>> THAT'S ILLEGAL.

439
00:13:12,133 --> 00:13:14,733
>> OKAY.

440
00:13:14,733 --> 00:13:16,733
[both laugh]

441
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:18,100
>> OKAY, YOU GOT A LITTLE BIT

442
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,167
MORE GAME THAN I THOUGHT

443
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:20,133
YOU DID.

444
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:21,833
>> THANK YOU, SIR.

445
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,333
>> YOU'RE ONE LUCKY [bleep]

446
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,200
BASTARD RIGHT NOW.

447
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,300
>> THANK YOU!

448
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,300
>> IT'S BEEN REAL MEETING YOU

449
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,200
GUYS.

450
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:29,133
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE.

451
00:13:29,133 --> 00:13:30,100
>> OKAY.

452
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:30,800
SEE YOU GUYS.

453
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,467
>> BYE.

454
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:34,433
>> YOUR LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN ME

455
00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:36,133
APPALLS ME, MY FRIEND.

456
00:13:36,133 --> 00:13:37,867
>> HEY, FROM NOW ON,

457
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:39,533
IT WON'T BE LIKE THAT.

458
00:13:39,533 --> 00:13:41,533
>> COOL.

459
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,067
>> DO YOU SEE THAT?

460
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:48,167
UGH.

461
00:13:48,167 --> 00:13:50,067
THERE'S THIS PICTURE ON

462
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:50,967
INSTAGRAM, AND I DON'T KNOW IF

463
00:13:50,967 --> 00:13:51,867
I SHOULD BE FREAKED OUT ABOUT

464
00:13:51,867 --> 00:13:53,067
IT, BUT IT'S A GIRL SITTING ON

465
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:55,600
THE BACK OF STONE'S CAR.

466
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,567
>> WHAT?

467
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:57,800
>> YEAH.

468
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,833
KIND OF LIKE RISQUE-LY.

469
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,200
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL

470
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,467
ABOUT THAT.

471
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:03,333
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT'S HIS

472
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:04,133
CAR?

473
00:14:04,133 --> 00:14:05,367
>> THE BACK OF IT,

474
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:06,867
AND HE'S JUST DUMB ENOUGH

475
00:14:06,867 --> 00:14:08,200
TO DO IT, SO...

476
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:08,933
>> YEAH.

477
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:10,900
>> I MEAN, LIKE, WHAT?

478
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,433
>> I WOULD PUT THAT--

479
00:14:12,433 --> 00:14:14,167
NO, I WOULD, LIKE, THROW MY

480
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:15,433
PHONE AT HIM AND BE LIKE,

481
00:14:15,433 --> 00:14:16,933
"WHAT IS THIS?"

482
00:14:16,933 --> 00:14:18,067
>> YEAH.

483
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:19,233
>> LIKE, I JUST FEEL LIKE THAT'S

484
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:20,633
DISRESPECTFUL.

485
00:14:20,633 --> 00:14:22,333
YOU NEED TO CONFRONT HIM.

486
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,567
>> IT'S HARD TO SAY ANYTHING

487
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:25,500
WHEN WE AREN'T, LIKE,

488
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,067
OFFICIALLY AN ITEM.

489
00:14:28,067 --> 00:14:29,267
I KNOW STONE AND I AREN'T

490
00:14:29,267 --> 00:14:31,233
TOGETHER, BUT IT STILL BUGS ME

491
00:14:31,233 --> 00:14:32,633
THAT HE'S MEETING GIRLS,

492
00:14:32,633 --> 00:14:34,100
SO I ASKED HIM TO COME BY

493
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:36,600
AND TALK.

494
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,467
>> WHAT'S UP?

495
00:14:37,467 --> 00:14:38,833
>> HI.

496
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:39,833
>> YOU WANT TO HOP IN?

497
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:40,500
>> NO.

498
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:41,267
>> WHY NOT?

499
00:14:41,267 --> 00:14:41,967
>> I DON'T LIKE IT.

500
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:44,067
>> TAKE YOU TO LUNCH.

501
00:14:44,067 --> 00:14:45,600
>> IT'S NOT SAFE.

502
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,067
>> FOR WHO, ME?

503
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:48,400
>> FOR ME.

504
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,433
>> GET YOU A HELMET.

505
00:14:50,433 --> 00:14:52,433
>> SHUT UP, STONE.

506
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,100
SO EVEN THOUGH WE AREN'T

507
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,667
TOGETHER, WHY DO YOU NEED TO

508
00:14:55,667 --> 00:14:57,833
FIND FEMALES?

509
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,300
>> I WORKED ALL [bleep] DAY

510
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:00,400
LONG, AND YOU CALL ME FOR THIS

511
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,167
[bleep]?

512
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:02,400
>> [sighs]

513
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,400
I WOULDN'T DO THAT IF YOU'D

514
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,300
ACTUALLY TREAT ME LIKE THE

515
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,633
MOTHER OF YOUR CHILD.

516
00:15:05,633 --> 00:15:07,067
LIKE THE BABY SHOWER

517
00:15:07,067 --> 00:15:08,133
AND THE OTHER NIGHT.

518
00:15:08,133 --> 00:15:08,967
LIKE, EVEN THOUGH WE'RE NOT

519
00:15:08,967 --> 00:15:11,067
TOGETHER, I THINK YOU'RE BEING

520
00:15:11,067 --> 00:15:13,867
INSENSITIVE ABOUT THE SITUATION.

521
00:15:13,867 --> 00:15:16,700
>> THAT'S 100% CORRECT.

522
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,533
>> OKAY, SO THEN WHAT ARE WE

523
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:18,267
DOING?

524
00:15:18,267 --> 00:15:19,233
>> I DON'T KNOW.

525
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:20,133
>> I DON'T HAVE TO BE WITH YOU

526
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:20,700
TO PARENT.

527
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,367
I REALLY DON'T.

528
00:15:21,367 --> 00:15:23,900
>> I-I NEVER SAID YOU DID.

529
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,433
>> THIS IS GOING NOWHERE,

530
00:15:25,433 --> 00:15:27,300
LIKE ALWAYS.

531
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,233
>> AIN'T THAT RIGHT?

532
00:15:28,233 --> 00:15:31,067
>> YEP.

533
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:32,367
>> HEY, GOOD SPEAKIN' WITH YA.

534
00:15:32,367 --> 00:15:34,367
>> [sighs]

535
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:52,100
>> SINCE THINGS AREN'T GOING

536
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,900
WELL WITH STONE, I'M TRYING TO

537
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,333
FOCUS ON THE BABY AND SPENDING

538
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,767
TIME WITH MY FRIENDS.

539
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:57,733
WHAT IF WE'RE PLAYING LASER TAG

540
00:15:57,733 --> 00:15:58,800
AND I JUST POP?

541
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,600
>> WELL, THEN WE'RE RUSHING YOU

542
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,467
TO A HOSPITAL,

543
00:16:01,467 --> 00:16:02,567
AND YOU'RE POPPING THAT BABY

544
00:16:02,567 --> 00:16:03,233
OUT.

545
00:16:03,233 --> 00:16:03,900
>> [laughs]

546
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:04,833
YEAH, OKAY.

547
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,433
>> ARE YOU READY TO GO?

548
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:07,233
>> YEAH.

549
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:08,100
>> SWEET.

550
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,067
>> LASER TAG.

551
00:16:09,067 --> 00:16:11,067
>> LET'S DO IT.

552
00:16:12,933 --> 00:16:14,233
>> I SMELL FOOD.

553
00:16:14,233 --> 00:16:16,200
[laughs]

554
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,433
IS IT BAD THAT I'M REALLY

555
00:16:17,433 --> 00:16:18,133
THAT HUNGRY?

556
00:16:18,133 --> 00:16:20,533
>> NO, 'CAUSE I'M STARVING.

557
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:21,767
>> WHAT'S UP?

558
00:16:21,767 --> 00:16:22,633
>> [laughs] HI.

559
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:25,200
>> HEY.

560
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,633
>> ARE YOU PREGNANT?

561
00:16:26,633 --> 00:16:27,967
>> OBVIOUSLY.

562
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:28,867
WOW.

563
00:16:28,867 --> 00:16:29,900
>> CLEARLY.

564
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:30,833
>> THAT'S CRAZY.

565
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:31,900
THAT'S KIND OF SCARY.

566
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,300
[laughter]

567
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:35,467
WE'RE ABOUT TO ROCK OUT.

568
00:16:35,467 --> 00:16:36,633

SOMETIMES WHEN I TELL YOU STUFF,

676
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,567
IT CAN BE TURNED AROUND

677
00:20:40,567 --> 00:20:43,000
AND USED AGAINST ME.

678
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:47,500

00:20:56,167 --> 00:20:57,933
THAT IT DOES AFFECT ME,

684
00:20:57,933 --> 00:20:59,467
BECAUSE WHEN I GOT PREGNANT,

685
00:20:59,467 --> 00:21:01,067
YOU DID TELL ME WE WERE GONNA DO

686
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:03,200
THIS TOGETHER, AND I FEEL LIKE

687
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,467
I'M DOING IT WITHOUT YOU

688
00:21:04,467 --> 00:21:06,467
BECAUSE OF YOUR DRINKING.

689
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,133
>> YOU'RE WRONG.

00:21:14,633 --> 00:21:17,067
BUT YOU ARE.

694
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,900
I AM NOT GONNA JUSTIFY OR

695
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,400
EXPLAIN MY BEHAVIOR TO ANYONE.

696
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,400
>> YEAH.

697
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:44,867
>> MY DUE DATE IS TOMORROW,

698
00:21:44,867 --> 00:21:46,200

00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:54,067
CHANGE HER WAYS, I WANT TO TRY

703
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:56,633
AND FIX THINGS WITH STONE.

704
00:21:56,633 --> 00:21:57,433
>> SO WHAT DO THEY HAVE TO DO

705
00:21:57,433 --> 00:21:58,300
TO YOU?

706
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,733
DO THEY HAVE TO, LIKE, STICK YOU

707
00:21:59,733 --> 00:22:00,533
WITH...

708
00:22:00,533 --> 00:22:01,200
>> NO.

709
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,367
>> NEEDLES?

710

00:22:04,933 --> 00:22:06,200
EVERY THREE TO FOUR HOURS,

712
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,533
THEY'LL PUT MEDICINE UP BY MY

00:22:07,533 --> 00:22:10,933
CERVIX TO SOFTEN IT AND HELP IT

714
00:22:10,933 --> 00:22:11,733
DILATE.

715
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:13,300
>> SO THEY SHOVE A--

00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,733
>> A SYRINGE.

717
00:22:15,733 --> 00:22:16,833

719
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:18,267
>> YEAH.

720
00:22:18,267 --> 00:22:21,900
THOUGH I AM QUITE HILARIOUS.

721
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:23,300
>> BE SERIOUS.

722
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,733
>> I AM.

723
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:25,833
WHAT IS IT?

724
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:27,933
>> I FEEL LIKE WE HAVEN'T BEEN

725
00:22:27,933 --> 00:22:29,733
THE NICEST TO EACH OTHER...

726
00:22:29,733 --> 00:22:30,567
>> WE HAVEN'T.

727
00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:32,533
>> DURING THIS PREGNANCY.

728
00:22:32,533 --> 00:22:34,300
AND IT'S NOT JUST YOUR FAULT.

729
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,667
IT IS MY FAULT.

730
00:22:35,667 --> 00:22:36,467
BUT--

731
00:22:36,467 --> 00:22:37,367
>> WOW, THAT'S THE FIRST TIME

732
00:22:37,367 --> 00:22:39,733
I'VE EVER HEARD YOU SAY THAT.

733
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:41,200
>> YEAH.

734
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,800
BUT I'M SCARED THAT I DON'T HAVE

735
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,467
CONTROL OVER WHAT'S ABOUT TO

736
00:22:46,467 --> 00:22:47,167
HAPPEN.

737
00:22:47,167 --> 00:22:48,067
DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M

738
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:48,567
SAYING?

739
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:49,400
>> I UNDERSTAND.

740
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,200
>> SO I NEED SUPPORT FROM YOU.

741
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,300
EVEN THOUGH WE AREN'T TOGETHER,

742
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:54,567
I NEED YOUR SUPPORT,

743
00:22:54,567 --> 00:22:57,067
BECAUSE THIS IS YOUR SON.

744
00:22:57,067 --> 00:23:00,467
AND I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO

745
00:23:00,467 --> 00:23:03,200
ENJOY IT WITH ME.

746
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,567
>> OKAY, BUT WE STILL DON'T HAVE

747
00:23:05,567 --> 00:23:08,100
A NAME, AND IT'S PROBABLY GONNA

748
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,100
BE DECIDED IN THE HOSPITAL.

749
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,667
I DON'T WANT SOMEONE ELSE'S

750
00:23:12,667 --> 00:23:14,800
TWO CENTS IN OUR SON'S NAME.

751
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,367
I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING

752
00:23:16,367 --> 00:23:17,067
THE PARENTS--

753
00:23:17,067 --> 00:23:18,900
>> YOU AND I CAN DECIDE.

754
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,167
SOUND GOOD?

755
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:22,133
>> YEAH.

756
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,267
>> YEAH.

757
00:23:26,267 --> 00:23:32,467

00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:43,600
>> I REALLY JUST FEEL LIKE IF

1134
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:44,933
I OPEN MY MOUTH AND SAY

1135
00:36:44,933 --> 00:36:46,567
SOMETHING TO HER, SHE'S GONNA

1136
00:36:46,567 --> 00:36:47,933
GET BETTER, AND I JUST NEED YOUR

1137
00:36:47,933 --> 00:36:50,833
EMOTIONAL SUPPORT WITH THAT.

1138
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:53,567
>> WHATEVER YOU NEED TO DO.

1139
00:36:53,567 --> 00:36:55,333
I'LL TRY MY BEST TO HELP YOU IF

1140
00:36:55,333 --> 00:36:57,267
YOU NEED HELP.

1141
00:36:57,267 --> 00:36:58,633
KIND OF LIKE HELPING YOUR TEAM

1142
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,700
WIN.

1143
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:19,333
>> DON'T GO AWAY.

1144
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:20,533
THIS EPISODE OF 16 AND PREGNANT 

1145
00:37:20,533 --> 00:37:22,533
CONTINUES RIGHT NOW.

1146
00:37:25,767 --> 00:37:27,500
THE NEXT MORNING, I FELT KIND OF

1147
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:29,333
BAD FOR CALLING THE COPS, SO

1148
00:37:29,333 --> 00:37:31,067
I LEFT ROWAN WITH STONE AND WENT

1149
00:37:31,067 --> 00:37:33,267
TO CHECK ON MY MOM.

1150
00:37:37,533 --> 00:37:38,800
I WAS WONDERING HOW YOU WERE

1151
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,733
FEELING.

1152
00:37:40,733 --> 00:37:43,067
I MEAN, IS IT SOMETHING YOU WANT

1153
00:37:43,067 --> 00:37:45,933
TO TALK ABOUT, OR SOMETHING THAT

1154
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:48,100
I SHOULD JUST LEAVE ALONE?

1155
00:37:54,367 --> 00:37:57,400
>> IT'S NO GOOD.

1156
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,400
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1157
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,767
I MEAN, I DON'T HAVE ANY EXCUSES

1158
00:38:00,767 --> 00:38:02,233
FOR YOU, YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE THERE

1159
00:38:02,233 --> 00:38:03,667
IS NO EXCUSE.

1160
00:38:03,667 --> 00:38:06,333
IT'S JUST NOT BEING STRONG

1161
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:08,067
ENOUGH, YOU KNOW?

1162
00:38:08,067 --> 00:38:10,200
>> YEAH.

1163
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,433
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT, LIKE,

1164
00:38:13,433 --> 00:38:15,700
INPATIENT TREATMENT?

1165
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:16,700
>> YOU KNOW HOW MANY TIMES I'VE

1166
00:38:16,700 --> 00:38:18,067
BEEN INPATIENT?

1167
00:38:18,067 --> 00:38:19,833
>> WELL, YEAH, BUT DO YOU FEEL

1168
00:38:19,833 --> 00:38:22,533
LIKE ONE MORE TIME COULD HELP?

1169
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:25,267
'CAUSE, I MEAN, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN

1170
00:38:25,267 --> 00:38:27,400
THAT WAY IN A LONG TIME.

1171
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,600
AND I WORRY THAT THAT COULD

1172
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,967
HAPPEN MORE OFTEN NOW.

1173
00:38:33,967 --> 00:38:36,067
OBVIOUSLY, THIS IS, YOU KNOW,

1174
00:38:36,067 --> 00:38:38,100
MY BABY, SO MY RESPONSIBILITY,

1175
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:40,567
BUT I FEEL LIKE I NEEDED HELP,

1176
00:38:40,567 --> 00:38:42,433
AND YOU'RE TOO INTOXICATED

1177
00:38:42,433 --> 00:38:44,333
TO HELP ME.

1178
00:38:44,333 --> 00:38:46,433
LIKE, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

1179
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:50,500
>> YEAH.

1180
00:38:55,067 --> 00:38:56,067
AND SOMETIMES I THINK

1181
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:57,233
THAT CAN GET A HANDLE ON IT

1182
00:38:57,233 --> 00:38:58,933
IF I JUST, YOU KNOW,

1183
00:38:58,933 --> 00:39:00,633
START GOING TO MEETINGS.

1184
00:39:00,633 --> 00:39:02,067
I THINK THAT WOULD BE MY ONLY

1185
00:39:02,067 --> 00:39:04,600
WAY OUT OF IT.

1186
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:06,467
YOU KNOW, I WANT TO BE A BETTER

1187
00:39:06,467 --> 00:39:08,633
EXAMPLE FOR YOU GUYS.

1188
00:39:08,633 --> 00:39:10,700
>> YEAH.

1189
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,633
TO SEE MY MOM STRUGGLE

1190
00:39:12,633 --> 00:39:15,133
BREAKS MY HEART.

1191
00:39:15,133 --> 00:39:17,433
IT COMPLETELY TEARS ME UP

1192
00:39:17,433 --> 00:39:18,867
INSIDE,

1193
00:39:18,867 --> 00:39:22,400
BUT IT'S BEEN A PART OF MY LIFE

1194
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:26,167
SINCE THE DAY I WAS BORN.

1195
00:39:26,167 --> 00:39:27,933
SOMETIMES I WISH I COULD JUST

1196
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:29,733
REWIND TIME AND FIGURE OUT

1197
00:39:29,733 --> 00:39:32,233
WHERE EVERYTHING WENT WRONG

1198
00:39:32,233 --> 00:39:35,333
AND FIX IT.

1199
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:36,767
I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE FUTURE

1200
00:39:36,767 --> 00:39:38,100
HOLDS.

1201
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,400
NO IDEA.

1202
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,167
WITH STONE, I HOPE THAT OUR

1203
00:39:42,167 --> 00:39:44,200
RELATIONSHIP CAN GET TO THE

1204
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,633
POINT WHERE WE CAN BE A HAPPY

1205
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:46,567
FAMILY.

1206
00:39:46,567 --> 00:39:47,933
THERE IS ALWAYS THE CHANCE THAT

1207
00:39:47,933 --> 00:39:50,467
WE ARE GONNA ARGUE, BUT I FEEL

1208
00:39:50,467 --> 00:39:51,700
LIKE WE'RE IN A GOOD SPOT NOW,

1209
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:52,467
YOU KNOW?

1210
00:39:52,467 --> 00:39:54,067
>> YEAH.

1211
00:39:54,067 --> 00:39:56,200
>> WHILE MY FRIENDS FINISH

1212
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,933
SCHOOL AND GO ON TO COLLEGE,

1213
00:39:58,933 --> 00:40:00,333
WHICH IS SOMETHING I WANTED

1214
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:01,700
SO BAD...

1215
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,500
MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME.

1216
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:05,333
I'M STILL DEALING WITH BEING

1217
00:40:05,333 --> 00:40:07,967
A MOM, FINISHING SCHOOL, G.E.D.

1218
00:40:07,967 --> 00:40:10,333
BUT I KNOW THAT ONE DAY

1219
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:11,867
EVERYTHING WILL WORK OUT THE WAY

1220
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:13,533
IT'S SUPPOSED TO.

1221
00:40:13,533 --> 00:40:15,500
I JUST HOPE IT COMES SOONER

1222
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:16,867
THAN LATER.
