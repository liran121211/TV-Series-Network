00:00:03,504 --> 00:00:04,938
>> I LOOK CUTE.

2
00:00:04,938 --> 00:00:06,774
I'M IZABELLA.

3
00:00:06,774 --> 00:00:07,941
I'M 16 YEARS OLD, AND I LIVE

4
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:09,210
IN DRAPER, UTAH.

5
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:10,711
WE MIGHT LIVE IN A TOTALLY

6
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:12,713
MORMON STATE, BUT MY PARENTS

7
00:00:12,713 --> 00:00:14,715
ARE PRETTY SERIOUS CATHOLICS.

8
00:00:14,715 --> 00:00:16,217
MY DAD WORKS FOR THE AIRLINES,

9
00:00:16,217 --> 00:00:17,118
AND MY MOM HAS A DAY CARE

10
00:00:17,118 --> 00:00:18,952
BUSINESS, BUT THEIR MAIN

11
00:00:18,952 --> 00:00:20,721
PRIORITY IS ME AND MY LITTLE

12
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:21,889
BROTHER'S EDUCATION.

13
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:23,224
>> SO WITH YOUR TEST,

14
00:00:23,224 --> 00:00:25,126
ARE YOU READY FOR IT?

15
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:26,294
>> I'M NOT DONE STUDYING YET.

16
00:00:26,294 --> 00:00:27,861
THEY SEND US TO CATHOLIC SCHOOL,

17
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:29,197
AND I'M GETTING READY TO GO BACK

18
00:00:29,197 --> 00:00:30,698
FOR MY SOPHOMORE YEAR.

19
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:31,699
BECAUSE I WANT TO GO TO MED

20
00:00:31,699 --> 00:00:33,401
SCHOOL, I'M IN ALL A.P. COURSES,

21
00:00:33,401 --> 00:00:35,403
AND I'M CONSTANTLY STUDYING.

22
00:00:35,403 --> 00:00:36,570
THE ONLY THING I TAKE MORE

23
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:37,738
SERIOUSLY THAN MY CLASSES

24
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:38,739
IS DRILL TEAM.

25
00:00:38,739 --> 00:00:39,740
ALL OF MY BEST FRIENDS

26
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:40,808
ARE ON THE SQUAD WITH ME,

27
00:00:40,808 --> 00:00:43,010
EXCEPT FOR MY BEST, BEST FRIEND

28
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,312
CASSIDY.

29
00:00:44,312 --> 00:00:45,313
WE'VE BEEN SEEING LESS OF EACH

30
00:00:45,313 --> 00:00:46,814
OTHER SINCE I STARTED SPENDING

31
00:00:46,814 --> 00:00:48,482
ALL MY TIME WITH MY BOYFRIEND,

32
00:00:48,482 --> 00:00:49,617
JAIRO.

33
00:00:49,617 --> 00:00:51,585
HE'S A BIT OF A SLACKER IN

34
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:52,920
SCHOOL AND CARES MUCH MORE

35
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:54,722
ABOUT HIS HAIR AND HIS CAR

36
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:56,257
THAN HIS GRADES, BUT HE'S

37
00:00:56,257 --> 00:00:58,692
SWEET AND REALLY UNDERSTANDS ME.

38
00:00:58,692 --> 00:00:59,527
EVEN THOUGH WE'VE ONLY BEEN

39
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:01,095
DATING FOR THREE MONTHS,

40
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:02,763
WE'VE GOTTEN REALLY CLOSE.

41
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:03,864
I'VE BEEN AVOIDING ALL

42
00:01:03,864 --> 00:01:05,499
MY FRIENDS THE WHOLE SUMMER

43
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:06,500
AND SPENDING EVERY SECOND

44
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,336
WITH JAIRO, BECAUSE I'M JUST

45
00:01:08,336 --> 00:01:09,837
TOO SCARED TO TELL EVERYONE

46
00:01:09,837 --> 00:01:11,505
THAT I'M PREGNANT.

47
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:13,474
[chime dings]

48
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:25,153
I WAS SO ASHAMED WHEN I FOUND

49
00:01:25,153 --> 00:01:26,820
OUT I WAS PREGNANT AT THE END OF

50
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,256
THE SCHOOL YEAR THAT I DECIDED

51
00:01:28,256 --> 00:01:29,423
TO KEEP THE BABY A SECRET

52
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,192
THROUGH THE SUMMER.

53
00:01:31,192 --> 00:01:32,860
BUT NOW I'M DUE IN A MONTH,

54
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:34,027
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER

55
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,196
I CAN IGNORE MY FRIENDS

56
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:37,298
OR HIDE MY BIG BELLY.

57
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:38,266
I'M LUCKY THAT MY MOM

58
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:39,767
IS UNDERSTANDING AND HELPS

59
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,101
AS MUCH AS SHE CAN.

60
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,102
HOW DO YOU THINK, LIKE,

61
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,238
MY FRIENDS ARE GONNA REACT?

62
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:45,072
>> THEY SHOULD BE SUPPORTIVE.

63
00:01:45,072 --> 00:01:46,174
I MEAN, YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS

64
00:01:46,174 --> 00:01:48,176
HAVE BEEN IN THE SAME SCHOOL

65
00:01:48,176 --> 00:01:49,009
FOR YEARS.

66
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:49,843
I MEAN, YOU'VE BEEN GOING TO

67
00:01:49,843 --> 00:01:50,944
THIS SCHOOL SINCE PRESCHOOL.

68
00:01:50,944 --> 00:01:52,112
THEY SHOULD BE THERE FOR YOU,

69
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,482
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF THEY WILL.

70
00:01:54,482 --> 00:01:56,650
EVEN IF THEY ARE MEAN AND HAVE

71
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:58,152
BAD THINGS TO SAY, WE CAN'T LET

72
00:01:58,152 --> 00:01:59,320
IT GET TO US, YOU KNOW?

73
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,654
YOU STILL HAVE A FEW MORE YEARS

74
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:01,989
OF SCHOOL, AND THAT'S WHAT

75
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:03,157
YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON,

76
00:02:03,157 --> 00:02:04,658
IS GETTING THROUGH SCHOOL.

77
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:05,626
>> DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN I, LIKE,

78
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,460
FIRST TOLD YOU THAT I WAS

79
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,896
PREGNANT?

80
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:10,898
DID YOU KNOW ALREADY?

81
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:11,899
>> I KIND OF HAD A FEELING,

82
00:02:11,899 --> 00:02:12,900
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T SEEM

83
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,001
YOURSELF.

84
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:14,668
YOU WEREN'T AS OPEN.

85
00:02:14,668 --> 00:02:15,503
YOU WEREN'T TALKING AS MUCH

86
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:17,505
AS YOU NORMALLY DO.

87
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:19,840
AND THEN IT--I DON'T KNOW.

88
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,175
IT'S LIKE I WANTED TO KNOW,

89
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:24,178
BUT THEN WHEN YOU CONFIRMED IT,

90
00:02:24,178 --> 00:02:25,012
I DIDN'T KNOW IF I WANTED

91
00:02:25,012 --> 00:02:27,014
TO KNOW ANYMORE.

92
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:29,016
AT FIRST, I DIDN'T FACE REALITY,

93
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:31,752
I THINK.

94
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:35,055
>> ARE YOU DISAPPOINTED IN ME?

95
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:37,225
>> OBVIOUSLY, I GUESS WE HAVE

96
00:02:37,225 --> 00:02:40,228
TO LOOK AT IT AS, YOU KNOW,

97
00:02:40,228 --> 00:02:41,061
IT'LL JUST BE AN ADDITION

98
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:42,230
TO OUR FAMILY, AND WE KIND OF

99
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:45,065
NEED TO GO FROM THAT.

100
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:46,834
I KNOW...

101
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:47,668
>> YOU'RE GONNA HELP ME TAKE

102
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:48,669
CARE OF HIM, RIGHT?

103
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:49,337
>> [laughs]

104
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:51,339

106
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:53,106
BURNING OR SOMETHING?

107
00:02:53,106 --> 00:02:54,608
>> NO, WHY?

108
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:55,876
[laughs]

109

111
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:58,579
THE STOVE WAS STILL ON.

112
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:01,181
YOU'RE DISTRACTING ME TOO MUCH.

113
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,752
>> SUMMER IS OVER IN TWO WEEKS.

114
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:06,254
SINCE I STILL HAVEN'T GOTTEN UP

115
00:03:06,254 --> 00:03:07,421
THE COURAGE TO TELL ANYBODY

116
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,423
OUTSIDE MY PARENTS AND JAIRO,

117
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:11,091
I ONLY LEAVE MY HOUSE IF WE GO

118
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:12,760
TO THE OTHER SIDE OF TOWN.

119
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,594

UNLESS YOU WANT TO GET OUT

126
00:03:22,503 --> 00:03:23,771

563
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:49,622
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S BECAUSE

564
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:51,124
MY MOM WAS SO STRICT.

565
00:14:51,124 --> 00:14:52,960
LIKE, SHE WAS TOO STRICT.

566
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,961
AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S ONE

567
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:56,796
OF THE REASONS WHY I'M--

568
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:59,799
I TRY TO BE FRIENDS,

569
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,134
OR I TRY TO BE A BUDDY WITH THEM

570
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:03,803
BECAUSE I WISH I HAD THAT

571
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:05,172
WITH MY OWN MOM.

572
00:15:05,172 --> 00:15:06,173
SO, YEAH, THAT'S ONE

573
00:15:06,173 --> 00:15:07,140
OF MY FAULTS.

574
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,142
I'M TOO SOFT WITH HER.

575
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:10,143
>> I LIKE THE WAY YOU ARE,

576
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:11,811

THEIR DAUGHTERS, LIKE,

581
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:17,817
HATE THEM.

582
00:15:17,817 --> 00:15:18,651
>> YEAH, BUT THEIR DAUGHTERS

583
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:19,819

584
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:22,155

BUT UNTIL NOW, I DIDN'T KNOW

590
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:30,497
HOW MUCH TROUBLE I'D CAUSED

591
00:15:30,497 --> 00:15:32,632

THIS WEEK, WE'RE GONNA PROBABLY

621

AFTER THE BABY IS BORN.

653
00:17:16,669 --> 00:17:17,837
ARE OKAY WITH HIM MOVING IN

654
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:18,571
WITH ME.

655
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:20,407
MY PARENTS, HOWEVER, WILL ONLY

656
00:17:20,407 --> 00:17:21,741

HE ENROLLS IN COLLEGE,

659

AND WE DON'T SLEEP

660
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:27,180
IN THE SAME BED.

661
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:29,349

AND NOW SHE DOESN'T TALK TO ME,

750
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:49,722
AND SHE DOESN'T--I DON'T KNOW.

751
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:51,224
IT'S LIKE SHE DOESN'T CARE.

USUALLY GETTING UP TO

THE INTERNET HIGH SCHOOL TOLD ME

1306
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:19,318
THAT I'M MISSING A COUPLE.

1307
00:35:19,318 --> 00:35:20,152
>> WHAT?

1308
00:35:20,152 --> 00:35:21,153
>> BUT YOU TOLD US YOU ALREADY

1309
00:35:21,153 --> 00:35:22,954
GRADUATED ONLINE.

1310
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:23,855
>> I HAVE BEEN LYING

1311
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:28,360
TO YOU GUYS.

1312
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:30,829
I HAVE BEEN TELLING YOU THAT

1313
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:32,063
I AM DOING MY HIGH SCHOOL

1314
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:33,899
ONLINE WHEN I REALLY HAVEN'T

1315
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:35,667
BEEN DOING IT.

1316
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:36,835
AND I DO FEEL GUILTY THAT

1317
00:35:36,835 --> 00:35:39,805
I'VE BEEN LYING TO YOU.

1318
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,642
>> YOU DECEIVED US.

1319
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:44,643
YOU KNOW, TRUST IS A LOT.

1320
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,278
IT MEANS A LOT.

1321
00:35:46,278 --> 00:35:47,279
BUT YOU CAN'T JUST

1322
00:35:47,279 --> 00:35:48,880
BE SITTING HERE.

1323
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,882
YOU NEED TO BE RESPONSIBLE.

1324
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:54,386
IF YOU DON'T SHOW US THAT

1325
00:35:54,386 --> 00:35:56,388
YOU'RE REALLY PUSHING YOURSELF,

1326
00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:58,424
THAT YOU'RE REALLY TRYING,

1327
00:35:58,424 --> 00:35:59,258
I DON'T KNOW THAT I WANT YOU

1328
00:35:59,258 --> 00:36:01,493
TO BE WITH MY DAUGHTER.

1329
00:36:23,782 --> 00:36:24,616
>> COME ON.

1330
00:36:24,616 --> 00:36:26,285
LET'S GET YOU IN THE BATH.

1331
00:36:26,285 --> 00:36:28,387
LET'S HURRY.

1332
00:36:28,387 --> 00:36:30,055
I'M REALLY HURT THAT JAIRO LIED

1333
00:36:30,055 --> 00:36:31,557
TO US ABOUT GRADUATING,

1334
00:36:31,557 --> 00:36:32,724
AND MY DAD IS NOT TOO HAPPY

1335
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:33,959
ABOUT IT EITHER.

1336
00:36:33,959 --> 00:36:36,528
>> I MEAN, THE LAST THING YOU

1337
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,864
WANT, IN MY OPINION, IS TO BE

1338
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:42,534
HELD BACK, AND HE'S GOING

1339
00:36:42,534 --> 00:36:43,835
THAT WAY WITH YOU.

1340
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:46,705
IF HE DOES NOT CHANGE HIS WAYS,

1341
00:36:46,705 --> 00:36:49,207
HE WILL HOLD YOU BACK.

1342
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:50,276
>> I UNDERSTAND.

1343
00:36:50,276 --> 00:36:51,443
I KNOW.

1344
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:52,778
I'VE TOLD HIM THAT BEFORE.

1345
00:36:52,778 --> 00:36:54,280
>> HE'S NOT YOUR PROBLEM.

1346
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,113
I'M SORRY.

1347
00:36:55,113 --> 00:36:56,948
IF ANYTHING, HE SHOULD BE

1348
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:59,651
YOUR SUPPORT, YOUR BACKBONE.

1349
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:00,819
>> I LOVE HIM, AND I WANT HIM

1350
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:02,621
TO BE AROUND, BUT I THINK

1351
00:37:02,621 --> 00:37:03,455
WE'VE GIVEN HIM ENOUGH

1352
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:05,491
OPPORTUNITIES ALREADY.

1353
00:37:05,491 --> 00:37:07,659
IF HE DECIDES TO LEAVE BECAUSE

1354
00:37:07,659 --> 00:37:11,162
HE CAN'T GRADUATE--HE CAN'T GET

1355
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:12,831
A JOB, HE DOESN'T LIKE BEING

1356
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:16,302
PUSHED--THAT'S LIFE.

1357
00:37:16,302 --> 00:37:17,469
EITHER HE CAN DO IT,

1358
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:19,471
OR HE CAN'T.

1359
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:21,607
AND IF HE DECIDES THAT HE CAN'T,

1360
00:37:21,607 --> 00:37:22,274
WE NEED TO KNOW SOONER

1361
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:26,345
RATHER THAN LATER.

1362
00:37:26,345 --> 00:37:28,980
SERIOUS BREAKFAST.

1363
00:37:33,352 --> 00:37:34,853
I REALLY WANT THINGS TO WORK OUT

1364
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:36,355
WITH JAIRO, BUT IF HE DOESN'T

1365
00:37:36,355 --> 00:37:38,089
GET HIS ACT TOGETHER, I'M NOT

1366
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,425
SURE MY DAD IS GOING TO STAND

1367
00:37:39,425 --> 00:37:42,428
FOR IT.

1368
00:37:42,428 --> 00:37:44,596
>> I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

1369
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,598
MY DAUGHTER, AS YOU KNOW,

1370
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:48,667
IS TAKEN CARE OF.

1371
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:52,170
I MEAN, MY PRIORITY IS IZABELLA

1372
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:54,005
AND ENRIQUE.

1373
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:55,674
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU LIKE

1374
00:37:55,674 --> 00:37:57,343
BEING HERE, RIGHT?

1375
00:37:57,343 --> 00:37:59,210
I THINK.

1376
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:00,379
YOU KNOW, GIVE US A TIMELINE.

1377
00:38:00,379 --> 00:38:02,648
SO BY WHEN...

1378
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:04,816
>> BY MAY, YEAH, FOR SURE,

1379
00:38:04,816 --> 00:38:06,151
GRADUATING.

1380
00:38:06,151 --> 00:38:07,986
>> BY MAY, TO GRADUATE?

1381
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:09,020
>> IF NOT, I'LL COMMUNICATE

1382
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:10,356
WITH YOU GUYS AND TELL YOU

1383
00:38:10,356 --> 00:38:12,524
WHAT'S GOING ON.

1384
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:14,225
>> OKAY.

1385
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:17,396
AND IF YOU DON'T, THEN YOU GO

1386
00:38:17,396 --> 00:38:18,430
LIVE WITH YOUR--BACK TO YOUR

1387
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:21,600
HOUSE, UNTIL YOU GET A JOB.

1388
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:22,601
IS THAT FAIR, OR IS THAT

1389
00:38:22,601 --> 00:38:25,303
NOT FAIR?

1390
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:26,304
>> SO IF I DON'T DO WHAT YOU

1391
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:28,974
GUYS ARE EXPECTING ME TO DO,

1392
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:30,642
UM, YOU THINK YOU CAN HANDLE

1393
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:32,277
ENRIQUE ON YOUR OWN?

1394
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:35,614
>> WELL, NO, I'M NOT SAYING THAT

1395
00:38:35,614 --> 00:38:36,615
YOU'RE NOT GONNA HELP ME,

1396
00:38:36,615 --> 00:38:40,886
'CAUSE THAT WOULDN'T BE FAIR.

1397
00:38:40,886 --> 00:38:44,390
JUST--YOU CAN'T BE WITH US

1398
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,724
ALL THE TIME AND LIVE HERE

1399
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:48,026
AND STUFF.

1400
00:38:57,803 --> 00:39:00,105
>> [coos]

1401
00:39:00,105 --> 00:39:03,274
>> IF JAIRO WASN'T WITH ME,

1402
00:39:03,274 --> 00:39:05,444
I WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE SAD.

1403
00:39:05,444 --> 00:39:06,277
WE'VE GONE THROUGH SO MUCH

1404
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:09,280
TOGETHER, AND I REALLY LOVE HIM

1405
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,183
AND CARE ABOUT HIM.

1406
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:13,619
I HOPE THAT THIS CHANGES THINGS

1407
00:39:13,619 --> 00:39:16,455
AND OPENS HIS EYES TO SEE

1408
00:39:16,455 --> 00:39:18,089
THAT THIS IS SERIOUS.

1409
00:39:18,089 --> 00:39:20,759
HAVING A BABY WHILE I'M STILL

1410
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:22,761
IN HIGH SCHOOL IS EXTREMELY

1411
00:39:22,761 --> 00:39:25,096
HARD, AND I WISH THAT I COULD BE

1412
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:28,934
HOME WITH HIM, BUT I KNOW THAT

1413
00:39:28,934 --> 00:39:30,101
HE'LL BE PROUD OF ME

1414
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:31,770
WHEN HE GROWS UP.

1415
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:32,771
HE'LL BE PROUD THAT I WENT BACK

1416
00:39:32,771 --> 00:39:36,107
TO SCHOOL.

1417
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:37,443
I WOULD SAY MY PRIORITIES

1418
00:39:37,443 --> 00:39:38,777
HAVE CHANGED A LOT.

1419
00:39:38,777 --> 00:39:41,613
MY NUMBER ONE PRIORITY NOW

1420
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:45,484
IS MY FAMILY, AND IT DIDN'T

1421
00:39:45,484 --> 00:39:46,485
USED TO BE THAT WAY.

1422
00:39:46,485 --> 00:39:47,819
I WOULD SAY MY FIRST PRIORITY

1423
00:39:47,819 --> 00:39:49,621
USED TO BE MY FRIENDS, PROBABLY,

1424
00:39:49,621 --> 00:39:52,458
BEING POPULAR AND HANGING OUT

1425
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:53,759
WITH ALL THE RIGHT PEOPLE.

1426
00:39:53,759 --> 00:39:55,761
>> IN THE NAME OF THE FATHER...

1427
00:39:55,761 --> 00:39:57,763
>> [crying]

1428
00:39:57,763 --> 00:39:59,598
>> AND OF THE SON.

1429
00:39:59,598 --> 00:40:00,932
>> NOT EVERYONE IS WHAT

1430
00:40:00,932 --> 00:40:02,267
THEY SEEM.

1431
00:40:02,267 --> 00:40:03,435
WHEN I GOT PREGNANT,

1432
00:40:03,435 --> 00:40:04,102
A LOT OF THE FRIENDS

1433
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:06,472
THAT I WAS CLOSEST TO,

1434
00:40:06,472 --> 00:40:08,807
THEY WEREN'T THERE FOR ME

1435
00:40:08,807 --> 00:40:09,808
ANYMORE.

1436
00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:11,643
I WOULDN'T HAVE THOUGHT THAT

1437
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:12,811
THEY COULD JUST ABANDON ME

1438
00:40:12,811 --> 00:40:15,113
LIKE THAT.

1439
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:16,448
IF MY FAMILY WASN'T SO

1440
00:40:16,448 --> 00:40:19,618
SUPPORTIVE, I DEFINITELY

1441
00:40:19,618 --> 00:40:21,653
COULDN'T BE SO STRONG MYSELF.

1442
00:40:21,653 --> 00:40:23,489
WHEN I TOLD MY PARENTS I WAS

1443
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:24,490
PREGNANT, THEY WERE THERE

1444
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:25,457
FOR ME.

1445
00:40:25,457 --> 00:40:26,458
IF MY MOM WASN'T HERE

1446
00:40:26,458 --> 00:40:28,326
TO TAKE CARE OF ENRIQUE,

1447
00:40:28,326 --> 00:40:29,160
I PROBABLY WOULDN'T GO BACK

1448
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:30,295
TO SCHOOL.

1449
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:32,130
MY FAMILY MEANS A LOT MORE

1450
00:40:32,130 --> 00:40:33,965
TO ME NOW, BECAUSE THEY WERE

1451
00:40:33,965 --> 00:40:35,133
THE MAIN PEOPLE THERE FOR ME

1452
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:36,968
WHILE I WAS PREGNANT.

1453
00:40:36,968 --> 00:40:38,704
YOU KNOW, FRIENDS COME AND GO,

1454
00:40:38,704 --> 00:40:40,672
BUT FAMILY IS FOREVER.

[cheers and applause]

1458

>> ONE NIGHT OF FUN

1459
00:41:00,058 --> 00:41:02,360
CAN RUIN EVERYTHING.

1460
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,029
>> IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY

1461
00:41:04,029 --> 00:41:05,931
BEING A KID WITH A KID.

1462
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:06,998
IT'S A STRUGGLE.

1463
00:41:06,998 --> 00:41:07,999
>> WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT,

1464
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:09,034
I'M LIKE, "I'M NOT GONNA BE

1465
00:41:09,034 --> 00:41:09,935
ABLE TO TAKE CARE OF HIM.

1466
00:41:09,935 --> 00:41:11,336
I'M NOT GONNA GRADUATE.

1467
00:41:11,336 --> 00:41:12,904
I'M NOT GONNA BE A VET."

1468
00:41:12,904 --> 00:41:13,972
>> SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT

1469
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,240
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT ADOPTION?

1470
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,041
>> YOU'RE JUST LOOKING

1471
00:41:16,041 --> 00:41:17,643
FOR EXCUSES TO GIVE HIM UP.

1472
00:41:17,643 --> 00:41:18,910
>> I'M NOT GONNA LET HAVING

1473
00:41:18,910 --> 00:41:20,679
A BABY RUIN MY DREAMS.

1474
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:22,047
>> I'D GIVE UP ANYTHING.

1475
00:41:22,047 --> 00:41:24,015
I JUST WANT TO RAISE MY SON.
