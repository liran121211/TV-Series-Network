AND EVEN EAT TOGETHER.

19
00:00:27,128 --> 00:00:28,229
PEOPLE CAN TELL US APART,

20
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:28,962
THOUGH, BECAUSE,

21
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:30,298
BEING SIX MINUTES OLDER,

22
00:00:30,298 --> 00:00:31,632
I'M THE MATURE ONE.

23
00:00:31,632 --> 00:00:32,300
>> WHY ARE THERE SO MANY

24
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:32,966

[giggles]

28
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:37,205
OUR PARENTS DIVORCED RIGHT AFTER

29
00:00:37,205 --> 00:00:38,206
WE WERE BORN.

30
00:00:38,206 --> 00:00:38,872
>> I'VE HAD IT!

31
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:39,873
>> AND RAISING TWIN BABIES

32
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,041
ON HER OWN WAS MORE THAN

33
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,210
OUR MOM COULD HANDLE.

34
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,877
SO MY GRANDPARENTS OFFICIALLY

35
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,213
ADOPTED US WHEN WE WERE

36
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:46,580
NINE YEARS OLD, AND WE'RE MUCH

37
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,748
CLOSER TO THEM THAN OUR REAL

38
00:00:47,748 --> 00:00:48,516
PARENTS.

39
00:00:48,516 --> 00:00:49,517
>> DRIVE CAREFUL.

40
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:50,684
SEAT BELT.

00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:51,352
[school bell rings]

42
00:00:51,352 --> 00:00:52,520
>> WHEN WE WERE ONLY 15,

43
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,687
WE LEFT NORMAL HIGH SCHOOL LIFE

44
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:54,855
BEHIND FOR GOOD TO BECOME

45
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:56,390
MODELS.

46
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,126
>> OKAY, JORDAN, YOU LOOK DOWN.

47
00:00:58,126 --> 00:00:59,460
>> EVEN THOUGH MY GRANDMA

48
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,295
TRAVELED WITH US AS OUR TUTOR,

49
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:02,463
I WOULD GET HOMESICK

50
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:04,198
IF WE WERE AWAY TOO LONG,

51
00:01:04,198 --> 00:01:05,366
ESPECIALLY AFTER I MET

52
00:01:05,366 --> 00:01:06,734
MY BOYFRIEND, BRIAN,

53
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,769
AT A LOCAL BASEBALL GAME.

54
00:01:08,769 --> 00:01:10,271

WHO THINKS I'M THE QUEEN

57
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:14,608
OF HIS WORLD.

58
00:01:14,608 --> 00:01:15,943
THE ONLY PROBLEM IS, SINCE BRIAN

59
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:17,745
CAME INTO THE PICTURE,

60
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:18,879
THINGS HAVEN'T BEEN THE SAME

61
00:01:18,879 --> 00:01:19,547
WITH MY SISTER.

62
00:01:19,547 --> 00:01:20,714
I TRY TO MAKE BOTH OF YOU HAPPY.

63
00:01:20,714 --> 00:01:23,016
IT'S SO FRICKIN' HARD, THOUGH.

64
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:24,118
SOMEHOW, THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE

65
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:25,286
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET

66
00:01:25,286 --> 00:01:25,953
ALONG...

67
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:26,687
>> YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

68
00:01:26,687 --> 00:01:28,656

SEVEN MONTHS LATER, SHE IS STILL

75
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,173
GIVING ME THE SAME LECTURE.

76
00:01:45,173 --> 00:01:46,140
>> YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND THAT

77
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,676
THE DECISIONS THAT YOU TWO MADE,

78
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:50,178
IT'S NOT ONLY AFFECTING YOU TWO.

79
00:01:50,178 --> 00:01:51,179
IT AFFECTS EVERYONE,

80
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:52,346
ALL YOUR FAMILY.

81
00:01:52,346 --> 00:01:53,013
>> I KNOW.

82
00:01:53,013 --> 00:01:54,348
I'M SORRY.

00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:55,883
BUT A LOT OF CHANGES--

85
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:58,051
>> WELL, I CAN'T CHANGE IT NOW.

86
00:01:58,051 --> 00:01:59,820
>> NO, YOU CAN'T.

87
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,821
BUT IT'S STILL AFFECTING

88
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:01,689
EVERYONE.

89
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:02,690
>> YEAH.

91
00:02:04,091 --> 00:02:07,060
>> I HAVE A BUMP RIGHT HERE.

92
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:08,929
IT HURTS, BUT...

93
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:10,764
>> YEAH, THAT'S PART OF MAKING

94
00:02:10,764 --> 00:02:12,500
THOSE KIND OF DECISIONS.

95
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,502
HAVING SEX IS BASICALLY WHAT

96
00:02:14,502 --> 00:02:16,870
IT'S FOR, IS REPRODUCING.

97
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:17,538

ON THE WAY, AND YOUR LIFE

100

HOMESCHOOLED WHILE WE WERE

106
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:29,016
MODELING, BUT WHEN I GOT

107
00:02:29,016 --> 00:02:30,351
PREGNANT, WE BOTH STOPPED

108
00:02:30,351 --> 00:02:32,019
AND ENROLLED IN G.E.D. CLASSES,

109
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:33,687
BECAUSE WE ALWAYS DO EVERYTHING

110

AND STUFF...

118
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:47,668
BUT I JUST KIND OF

119
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:48,702
BLOCK HER OUT.

120
00:02:48,702 --> 00:02:49,870
>> I THINK THAT'S KIND OF MEAN.

121
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,904
>> WHY?

122
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,072
>> I KNOW HE'S, LIKE, A MISTAKE

123
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:54,775
OR WHATEVER, BUT HE'S HERE NOW.

124
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:55,776
>> YEAH, BUT HE'S NOT GONNA

125
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:57,278
BE CALLED A MISTAKE.

WHEN HE HAS A NEPHEW,

137
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:13,794
HE WILL UNDERSTAND.

138
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:17,965

>> IT'S GONNA BE WEIRD

142
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:23,937
NOT GOING WITH YOU, THOUGH,

143
00:03:23,937 --> 00:03:24,872

>> YOU HAVE ELLIE.

145
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:26,840

146
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:27,675
>> OKAY, I'LL JUST REPLACE YOU

>> WHATEVER.

150
00:03:31,011 --> 00:03:32,012
THAT'S 'CAUSE YOU REPLACED ME

151
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:33,046

WEDDING CAKE.

192
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,968
GETTING PREGNANT WAS A BIG

193
00:04:27,968 --> 00:04:29,136
SURPRISE FOR US BECAUSE

194
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:30,971
I WAS ON THE PILL.

195
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:31,972
WE LEARNED TOO LATE THAT

196
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:33,006
I HADN'T TAKEN IT LONG ENOUGH

197
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:33,974
FOR IT TO WORK.

198
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:34,642
>> IT'S GONNA BE WEIRD

199
00:04:34,642 --> 00:04:36,977
NOT SEEING YOU PREGNANT,

200
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:38,145
'CAUSE YOU'VE BEEN PREGNANT FOR,

201
00:04:38,145 --> 00:04:40,280
LIKE, THE MAJORITY OF OUR

202
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,282
RELATIONSHIP.

203
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,585
[chuckles]

204
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:45,285
I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER

205
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:46,887
WHAT IT WAS LIKE.

206
00:04:46,887 --> 00:04:49,357
>> WELL, I WAS 30 POUNDS

207
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:50,424
LIGHTER.

208
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:51,258
>> I THINK IT WAS RIGHT AFTER

209
00:04:51,258 --> 00:04:51,992
I ASKED YOU OUT, LIKE,

210
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:53,327
I SAW THE MODELING PICTURES

211
00:04:53,327 --> 00:04:55,128
OF YOU, AND I WAS, LIKE,

212
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,296
SHOWING THEM OFF TO EVERYBODY.

213
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,498
I WAS LIKE, "YEP,

214
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:58,231
I'M DATING A MODEL.

215
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,132
NO BIG DEAL."

216
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,801
I DO REMEMBER, THOUGH, LIKE,

217
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,370
WHEN I FIRST ASKED YOU OUT,

218
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,371
THINKING LIKE, "WOW.

219
00:05:03,371 --> 00:05:04,204
WE WOULD MAKE A REALLY

220
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:06,073
BEAUTIFUL BABY."

221
00:05:06,073 --> 00:05:07,274
[laughter]

222
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:08,776
EXCEPT NOT AS SOON.

223
00:05:08,776 --> 00:05:10,878
MAYBE A COUPLE YEARS FROM NOW.

224
00:05:10,878 --> 00:05:12,446
>> LIKE FOUR.

225
00:05:12,446 --> 00:05:14,482
>> OR SEVEN.

226
00:05:14,482 --> 00:05:15,315
>> YEAH.

227
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,149
>> I REMEMBER BACK WHEN YOUR

228
00:05:16,149 --> 00:05:17,317
GRANDMA, LIKE--IF I WAS OVER

229
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,519
AT YOUR HOUSE, WE WEREN'T

230
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,353
ALLOWED TO--

231
00:05:19,353 --> 00:05:20,354
>> SHARE A BLANKET.

232
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:21,355
>> SHARE A BLANKET.

233
00:05:21,355 --> 00:05:22,690
OR SHE'D ALWAYS GET MAD

234
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,524
IF SHE SAW US, LIKE,

235
00:05:23,524 --> 00:05:24,692
EVER KISS OR ANYTHING.

236
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:25,793
>> OH, I REMEMBER THAT ONE TIME

237
00:05:25,793 --> 00:05:27,127
I KISSED YOU IN MY KITCHEN,

238
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:27,961
AND SHE WAS RIGHT THERE,

239
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,129
AND I DIDN'T EVEN REALIZE IT,

240
00:05:29,129 --> 00:05:30,130
AND SHE LOOKED AT ME ANGRY.

241
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,132
I WAS LIKE...

242
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,434
OOPS!

243
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:34,635
>> SHE WAS LIKE, "I DON'T WANT

244
00:05:34,635 --> 00:05:36,303
YOU KISSING HIM, BECAUSE KISSING

245
00:05:36,303 --> 00:05:38,305
JUST LEADS TO OTHER THINGS."

246
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:38,972
>> YEAH, THAT'S--

247
00:05:38,972 --> 00:05:41,775
AIN'T THAT THE TRUTH?

248
00:05:45,078 --> 00:05:46,780
TODAY IS MY BABY SHOWER,

249
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,881
AND MY SISTER IS THROWING ME

250
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:50,150
A PARTY AT ELLIE'S HOUSE.

251
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:51,018
>> EVERYBODY, THEY'RE COMING,

252
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:51,919
OKAY?

253
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:53,253
>> WE STILL NEED A LOT OF STUFF

254
00:05:53,253 --> 00:05:54,755
FOR THE BABY, BUT WE ALREADY

255
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:56,256
DECIDED HIS NAME IS GOING

256
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:57,090
TO BE...

257
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,759
>> all: NOAH!

258
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,494
[laughter]

259
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:01,995
>> FIRST GAME, WE'RE GONNA PLAY

260
00:06:01,995 --> 00:06:03,664
MUSIC, AND YOU'RE JUST ALL GONNA

261
00:06:03,664 --> 00:06:04,998
PASS THE BOTTLE AROUND.

262
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:05,999
>> DON'T LET IT GET ME.

263
00:06:05,999 --> 00:06:09,036
DON'T LET IT GET ME.

264
00:06:09,036 --> 00:06:10,571
[laughter]

265
00:06:10,571 --> 00:06:11,739
THE GIRLS ARE FEEDING THE GUYS,

266
00:06:11,739 --> 00:06:12,906
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE BLINDFOLDED.

267
00:06:12,906 --> 00:06:13,741
>> OH, GOSH, THIS IS GONNA

268
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:15,242
BE ALL OVER.

269
00:06:15,242 --> 00:06:16,944
[laughter]

270
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:19,547
>> AH, THAT'S HIS EYE!

271
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:20,848
>> YEAH!

272
00:06:20,848 --> 00:06:22,850
>> YAY!

273
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:25,453
>> DIAPERS.

274
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:26,454
>> AT LUNCH, AT SCHOOL ONE DAY,

275
00:06:26,454 --> 00:06:27,621
I WAS LIKE, "BRIAN IS HAVING

276
00:06:27,621 --> 00:06:29,156
A BABY, WHAT?"

277
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:30,157
>> I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT,

278
00:06:30,157 --> 00:06:31,492
'CAUSE I HEARD BRIAN TALKING

279
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:32,493
ABOUT IT, AND THEN I ASKED

280
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:33,661
ETHAN, AND EVERYONE WAS KEEPING

281
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:35,663
IT A SECRET.

282
00:06:35,663 --> 00:06:36,664
>> UM, I WAS, LIKE, TWO WEEKS

283
00:06:36,664 --> 00:06:39,066
LATE, SO WE WENT AND GOT A TEST.

284
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,234
I TOLD BRIAN TO GO LOOK--

285
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:41,902
>> YEAH, YOU DIDN'T EVEN

286
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:42,570
TELL ME.

287
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,403
YOU WERE LIKE, "OH, MY GOD.

288
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:44,371
GO LOOK AT THE TEST."

289
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:45,839
>> HIS FACE WAS WHITE.

290
00:06:45,839 --> 00:06:46,674
>> I DON'T THINK IT REGISTERED

291
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:48,008
FOR A COUPLE MONTHS.

292
00:06:48,008 --> 00:06:48,842
>> I DON'T THINK IT REGISTERED

293
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:49,610
TILL I TOLD MY GRANDMA.

294
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:51,812
[laughter]

295
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:52,646
>> ARE YOU--DO YOU PLAN ON

296
00:06:52,646 --> 00:06:53,814
MOVING IN TOGETHER SOON?

297
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:55,315
>> WHEN NOAH COMES?

298
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:58,151
>> THAT'S A TOUCHY SUBJECT.

299
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,152
>> WHAT I THINK IT IS,

300
00:06:59,152 --> 00:07:02,490
JESSIE IS FEELING LEFT OUT.

301
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,156
>> I DON'T KNOW.

302
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:03,824
I THINK BRIAN, LIKE,

303
00:07:03,824 --> 00:07:05,158
GETS IN THE WAY SOMETIMES.

304
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,495
SORRY, BRIAN.

305
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:08,161
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT

306
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,830
WE'RE GONNA DO.

307
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,764
THINGS ARE TENSE BECAUSE

308
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,099
MY SISTER THINKS BRIAN

309
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,601
IS EDGING HER OUT.

310
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:14,602
SO WHEN I ASKED MY GRANDMA

311
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:16,269
IF HE COULD MOVE IN, SHE SAID

312
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:17,270
SHE WOULD HAVE TO THINK

313
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:17,938
ABOUT IT.

314
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,439
BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO US

315
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,941
THAT WE GET TO LIVE TOGETHER,

316
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:22,275
BECAUSE BRIAN IS GIVING UP

317
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,443
GOING AWAY TO COLLEGE

318
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:24,945
SO WE COULD BE A FAMILY.

319
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,046
HE NOW WORKS AT A RESTAURANT

320
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:27,380
AND WILL GO TO A COMMUNITY

321
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,116
COLLEGE NEARBY IN THE FALL.

322
00:07:29,116 --> 00:07:30,784
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT BRIAN

323
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:31,752
MOVING IN?

324
00:07:31,752 --> 00:07:33,286
>> I HAVE.

325
00:07:33,286 --> 00:07:34,287
MY BIGGEST CONCERN IS,

326
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,623
IS THIS GONNA BE TOO MUCH

327
00:07:35,623 --> 00:07:37,791
PRESSURE ON BOTH OF YOU?

328
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:38,626
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE TRYING

329
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:39,326
TO GO TO SCHOOL.

330
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:40,494
>> I GUESS THE WAY I LOOK AT IT

331
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:41,829
IS, IF I LIVED HERE AND HELPED

332
00:07:41,829 --> 00:07:43,196
TAKE CARE OF NOAH, THEN WE COULD

333
00:07:43,196 --> 00:07:44,865
SUPPORT EACH OTHER EMOTIONALLY.

334
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:45,699
I THINK IT WOULD BE

335
00:07:45,699 --> 00:07:46,700
A LOT EASIER.

336
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,868
>> YEAH, I JUST DON'T WANT YOU

337
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:48,869
GUYS TO BE TOGETHER BECAUSE

338
00:07:48,869 --> 00:07:49,637
OF NOAH.

339
00:07:49,637 --> 00:07:50,971
>> I DON'T WANT TO BE WITH BRIAN

340
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,640
JUST 'CAUSE OF NOAH.

341
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,141
>> EVEN IF, LIKE, I DON'T LIVE

342
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,909
HERE, I STILL THINK THAT

343
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:56,910
THIS IS A REALLY GOOD PLACE

344
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:57,911
FOR NOAH TO BE, 'CAUSE YOU HAVE

345
00:07:57,911 --> 00:07:59,780
A REALLY STRONG SENSE OF FAMILY.

346
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,948
[voice breaks] AND I NEVER

347
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:03,116
REALLY GREW UP WITH THAT.

348
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:05,118
I WANT NOAH TO ALWAYS HAVE

349
00:08:05,118 --> 00:08:07,521
A STRONG RELATIONSHIP WITH ME.

350
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:08,188
>> WELL, AND THAT'S WHAT

351
00:08:08,188 --> 00:08:10,290
I WANT TO SEE YOU TWO GROW INTO.

352
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,258
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS

353
00:08:11,258 --> 00:08:14,361
THAT HAS CONVINCED ME THE MOST

354
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:15,362
THAT YOU GUYS ARE REALLY

355
00:08:15,362 --> 00:08:17,030
DEDICATED TO ONE ANOTHER--

356
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,398
AND I CAN SEE HOW MUCH

357
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:19,499
YOU LOVE ONE ANOTHER.

358
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,070
SO, BRIAN, YOU CAN MOVE IN.

359
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:24,071
>> HMM!

360
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:25,105
>> BUT ONE OF THE THINGS

361
00:08:25,105 --> 00:08:27,941
THAT REALLY STILL BOTHERS ME IS,

362
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,610
I HAVE JESSICA HERE, AND I HAVE

363
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,611
TO THINK ABOUT, HOW IS THIS

364
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:32,613
GOING TO AFFECT HER?

365
00:08:32,613 --> 00:08:35,482
>> YEAH.

366
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:37,384
I'M RELIEVED MY GRANDMA IS GOING

367
00:08:37,384 --> 00:08:39,386
TO LET BRIAN MOVE IN, BUT I AM

368
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:40,387
NOT LOOKING FORWARD TO TELLING

369
00:08:40,387 --> 00:08:41,388
MY SISTER.

370
00:08:41,388 --> 00:08:43,356
[tapping at door]

371
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,396
>> ARE YOU READY FOR SCHOOL?

372
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:50,063
>> YEP.

373
00:08:50,063 --> 00:08:50,864
>> YEAH.

374
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,232
>> OKEYDOKEY, GUYS.

375
00:08:52,232 --> 00:08:53,867
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

376
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,035
>> I'M EXCITED THAT BRIAN

377
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,704
IS MOVING IN NEXT WEEK,

378
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:58,005
BUT NOW I'VE GOT TO TELL

379
00:08:58,005 --> 00:08:58,839
MY SISTER.

380
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,373
SO, J...

381
00:09:00,373 --> 00:09:01,809
>> HMM?

382
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:02,643
>> I TALKED TO GRANDMA,

383
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:06,146
AND SHE SAID BRIAN CAN MOVE IN.

384
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,481
>> [sighs]

385
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:09,783
WHEN?

386
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:11,351
>> IN, LIKE, A WEEK OR SO.

387
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:13,854
>> HE'S GONNA BE THERE NOW

388
00:09:13,854 --> 00:09:15,689
ALL THE TIME.

389
00:09:15,689 --> 00:09:17,557
>> OH, MY GOSH.

390
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,892
>> HE'S GONNA BE IN YOUR ROOM

391
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,228
ALL THE TIME, SO I'M NOT GONNA

392
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:23,731
BE ABLE TO JUST, LIKE,

393
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:24,898
GO DOWN THERE AND LAY IN

394
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:27,034
YOUR BED WITH YOU.

395
00:09:27,034 --> 00:09:28,035
>> I'LL COME LAY IN YOUR BED

396
00:09:28,035 --> 00:09:30,671
WITH YOU.

397
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:38,712
>> THESE...

398
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:39,613
>> BRIAN IS MOVING HIS STUFF

399
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:41,214
OVER TODAY.

400
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:42,182
>> I THINK WE'VE GOT IT ALL.

401
00:09:42,182 --> 00:09:43,817
>> I'LL GRAB THE LITTLE BOX.

402
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:44,818
AND EVEN THOUGH HIS MOM'S

403
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:46,153
DISAPPOINTED THAT HE'S NOT

404
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:48,388
GOING AWAY TO COLLEGE,

405
00:09:48,388 --> 00:09:49,222
SHE'S HAPPY THAT HE'S

406
00:09:49,222 --> 00:09:50,724
STEPPING UP AS A DAD.

407
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:52,459
>> YOU GONNA BE READY FOR THAT?

408
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:54,628
ALL HIS SMELLY CLOTHES IN THERE?

409
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:56,630
>> THEY'RE NOT SMELLY.

410
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,065
IT WAS NICE KNOWING YOU.

411
00:09:58,065 --> 00:09:59,900
I'LL SEE YOU SOMEDAY.

412
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:00,768
>> ALL RIGHT.

413
00:10:00,768 --> 00:10:02,069
I LOVE YOU.

414
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:03,403
[laughter]

415
00:10:03,403 --> 00:10:04,571
>> I'M HAPPY BRIAN AND I

416
00:10:04,571 --> 00:10:05,973
ARE GOING TO BE LIVING TOGETHER

417
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:07,240
BECAUSE THE BABY IS DUE

418
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,341
IN SIX WEEKS.

419
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,677
BUT THIS IS A BIG CHANGE

420
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:11,211
FOR MY SISTER.

421
00:10:11,211 --> 00:10:13,046
HERE, THIS IS YOUR TOP DRAWER.

422
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:14,214
>> MY UNDIES.

423
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:15,348
>> HEH-HEH-HEH.

424
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:16,349
>> WELL, I DON'T REALLY WANT

425
00:10:16,349 --> 00:10:17,184
TO GO THROUGH YOUR CLOTHES,

426
00:10:17,184 --> 00:10:19,687
SO I'M GOING UPSTAIRS.

427
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:20,453
>> GOOD.

428
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,254
>> JESSIE, YOU MEAN YOU DON'T

429
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:22,589
WANT TO FOLD HIS BOXERS?

430
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:24,557
>> NO.

431
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,631
MOVE DOWN.

432
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,100
>> WHO?

433
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,767
>> EVERYBODY SHARE.

434
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:34,802
>> YOU.

435
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:36,303
>> JESSIE IS WANTING TO SIT.

436
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:38,005
>> MOVE IT.

437
00:10:38,005 --> 00:10:40,507
>> [laughs]

438
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:41,742
SO, JESSIE, HOW ARE YOU DEALING

439
00:10:41,742 --> 00:10:42,910
WITH BRIAN BEING IN THE HOUSE

440
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:44,577
AND...

441
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:45,245
>> I MEAN, IT'S GONNA BE

442
00:10:45,245 --> 00:10:46,079
A LOT DIFFERENT.

443
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:46,914
>> IT'S PROBABLY NEVER GONNA

444
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:49,149
BE THE SAME.

445
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,884
>> ALL RIGHT, I HAVE TO GET

446
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:51,551
IN THE SHOWER.

447
00:10:51,551 --> 00:10:52,219
>> YEAH, YOU DO.

448
00:10:52,219 --> 00:10:53,721
YOU STINK.

449
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:55,055
>> BRIAN...

450
00:10:55,055 --> 00:10:55,889
>> I'M GONNA GET IN THE SHOWER

451
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:56,690
TOO, JORDAN.

452
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:57,691
>> ALL RIGHT.

453
00:10:57,691 --> 00:10:58,525
>> I'M GONNA TURN IT ALL THE WAY

454
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,527
UP SO JESSIE GETS NO HOT WATER.

455
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:01,528
>> SHE'LL KILL YOU.

456
00:11:01,528 --> 00:11:03,663
>> I WILL HURT YOU.

457
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:04,865
>> NOW THAT BRIAN'S MOVED IN,

458
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:05,866
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT

459
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,234
I KEEP SPENDING TIME WITH

460
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:08,902
MY SISTER.

461
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:09,903
OKAY, THANK YOU.

462
00:11:09,903 --> 00:11:11,939
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

463
00:11:11,939 --> 00:11:12,672
>> I HAVEN'T BEEN BACK HERE

464
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,841
SINCE LAST SUMMER.

465
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:14,674
>> YEAH, I LIKE BEING WITH

466
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,009
JUST ME AND YOU.

467
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:16,910
>> THIS IS THE FIRST TIME WHEN

468
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:18,578
WE BOTH HAVEN'T BEEN DOING

469
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:19,579
THE SAME THING.

470
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:20,613
>> I KNOW.

471
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,382
YOU'RE GONNA BE A MOM.

472
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:23,216
>> WELL, ONE DAY, WHEN YOU'RE

473
00:11:23,216 --> 00:11:24,051
A MOM, THEN WE'LL BE DOING

474
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:25,652
THE SAME THING.

475
00:11:25,652 --> 00:11:26,486
>> OR IF YOU WOULD HAVE STUCK

476
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:27,320
WITH MODELING, WE'D BE DOING

477
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,321
THE SAME THING.

478
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:30,023
>> JESSICA, SERIOUSLY.

479
00:11:30,023 --> 00:11:30,690
>> WHAT ARE YOU GONNA PUT

480
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,591
ON THE OUTSIDE?

481
00:11:31,591 --> 00:11:32,259
>> I'M GONNA MAKE THIS

482
00:11:32,259 --> 00:11:33,260
FOR BRIAN.

483
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,094
>> NOT EVERYTHING IS ABOUT

484
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:34,995
BRIAN, JORDAN.

485
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:36,730
>> YOU PICK ON HIM A LOT.

486
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,564
>> HE PICKS ON ME.

487
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:38,832
>> BECAUSE YOU DO IT BACK.

488
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:40,000
>> YOU'RE ALWAYS DEFENDING HIM.

489
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:40,768
>> IT'S HARD FOR YOU TO

490
00:11:40,768 --> 00:11:41,634
UNDERSTAND, 'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT

491
00:11:41,634 --> 00:11:42,669
IN THIS SITUATION.

492
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:43,670
>> UM, IT'S HARD FOR YOU TO

493
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:44,671
UNDERSTAND, 'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT

494
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:45,873
IN MY SITUATION.

495
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:46,639
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT

496
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:47,407
TO TELL YOU.

497
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:50,310
[baby crying]

498
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:51,644
>> THERE'S YOUR FUTURE.

499
00:11:51,644 --> 00:11:55,548
>> SHUT UP.

500
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,053
IT'S TIME FOR MY WEEKLY CHECKUP.

501
00:12:00,053 --> 00:12:01,054
EVEN THOUGH THINGS AREN'T

502
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:02,722
PERFECT AT HOME, I'M HAPPY

503
00:12:02,722 --> 00:12:03,891
THAT BRIAN AND MY SISTER

504
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:04,892
ARE COMING WITH ME,

505
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:06,059
BECAUSE I WANT BOTH OF THEM TO

506
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,095
BE THERE IN THE DELIVERY ROOM.

507
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:08,762
>> I COULD GO DOWN TO

508
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:09,963
THE FOOD COURT.

509
00:12:09,963 --> 00:12:10,798
>> ME AND BRIAN CAN GO

510
00:12:10,798 --> 00:12:12,399
EXPLORING.

511
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,233
>> I DON'T WANT TO GO EXPLORING

512
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,401
WITH YOU.

513
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,602
YOU'RE MEAN TO ME.

514
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,437
>> YOU'RE MEAN TO ME.

515
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:18,671
>> OH, MY GOSH, YOU TWO...

516
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:21,474
>> [humming]

517
00:12:21,474 --> 00:12:22,709
>> BRIAN...

518
00:12:22,709 --> 00:12:24,044
>> WHAT IS THIS?

519
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:25,045
>> YOU KNOW, EVERY TIME WE COME

520
00:12:25,045 --> 00:12:26,546
IN HERE, YOU PLAY WITH STUFF.

521
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:27,714
>> YEAH, YOU ACT LIKE A CHILD.

522
00:12:27,714 --> 00:12:28,548
>> WHY WOULD THEY LEAVE IT

523
00:12:28,548 --> 00:12:29,616
ALL OUT IF THEY DIDN'T WANT YOU

524
00:12:29,616 --> 00:12:30,818
TO PLAY WITH IT?

525
00:12:30,818 --> 00:12:31,819
>> OH, MY GOSH, BRIAN,

526
00:12:31,819 --> 00:12:32,652
REALLY, STOP.

527
00:12:32,652 --> 00:12:34,254
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

528
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,088
>> WHO GAVE NOAH HIS "Y"

529
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:36,156
CHROMOSOME?

530
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:36,990
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW IT WASN'T

531
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,325
ANOTHER GUY?

532
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:41,862
>> OKAY, JESSIE, SHUT UP.

533
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:45,899
[knocking at door]

534
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:46,733
>> ALL RIGHT, JORDAN,

535
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:48,235
IT LOOKS WONDERFUL.

536
00:12:48,235 --> 00:12:50,537
YOU'RE OUT OF HERE.

537
00:12:55,308 --> 00:12:57,710
>> SO I WAS THINKING, LIKE,

538
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,046
YOU KNOW HOW YOU PLAN ON HAVING,

539
00:12:59,046 --> 00:13:00,881
LIKE, YOUR SISTER IN THE ROOM

540
00:13:00,881 --> 00:13:02,349
WHEN YOU HAVE THE BABY?

541
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:03,016
>> YEAH.

542
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,517
>> LIKE, I KIND OF JUST WANT IT

543
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:06,653
TO BE ME AND YOU.

544
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:07,320
>> YEAH.

545
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,155
>> IT'S HARD FOR ME TO BOND

546
00:13:08,155 --> 00:13:10,323
WITH YOU WHEN YOUR, LIKE, SISTER

547
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:12,159
IS ALWAYS THERE.

548
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:12,993
>> WELL, I MEAN, I WANT HER

549
00:13:12,993 --> 00:13:13,827
TO BE THERE.

550
00:13:13,827 --> 00:13:14,661
I MEAN, LIKE, IT'S HARD

551
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,663
BECAUSE, LIKE, WE'RE SO CLOSE.

552
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:18,999
>> BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE AWAY

553
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,500
SOME OF THE SPECIALNESS FOR ME

554
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,135
IF SHE'S IN THE ROOM.

555
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,636
>> I--WELL, I CAN TALK TO HER.

556
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,804
BUT I DON'T WANT HER, LIKE,

557
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,973
TO HATE ME.

558
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:26,974
>> SHE'S NOT GONNA HATE YOU,

559
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:27,841
JORDAN.

560
00:13:27,841 --> 00:13:29,009
>> WELL, LIKE, YOU DON'T

561
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:31,011
UNDERSTAND, LIKE, HOW CLOSE

562
00:13:31,011 --> 00:13:32,679
WE WERE.

563
00:13:32,679 --> 00:13:33,813
>> I DO UNDERSTAND, BUT I THINK

564
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:34,814
IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HER

565
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,316
TO REALIZE NOW THAT'S SHE'S NOT

566
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,986
GONNA BE THE NUMBER ONE PERSON

567
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:41,454
IN YOUR LIFE ANYMORE.

568
00:13:44,724 --> 00:13:45,558
>> I UNDERSTAND WHERE BRIAN

569
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:46,894
IS COMING FROM, BUT I REALLY

570
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:48,061
DOUBT MY SISTER WILL SEE IT

571
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:49,162
THE SAME WAY.

572
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:50,663
>> DO YOU FEEL READY?

573
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:52,532
>> YEAH, KIND OF.

574
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:55,302
JUST NERVOUS ABOUT LABOR.

575
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:55,969
>> I KNOW.

576
00:13:55,969 --> 00:13:56,803
>> I WATCHED THE LABOR VIDEO.

577
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:57,637
>> I HOPE YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE

578
00:13:57,637 --> 00:13:58,972
A C-SECTION, 'CAUSE THEN

579
00:13:58,972 --> 00:14:00,140
I CAN'T BE IN THERE.

580
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,475
>> JESSIE...

581
00:14:02,475 --> 00:14:04,477
BRIAN WANTS JUST ME AND HIM.

582
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:05,312
HE WANTS IT TO BE, LIKE,

583
00:14:05,312 --> 00:14:06,479
A PRIVATE MOMENT.

584
00:14:06,479 --> 00:14:08,148
>> SERIOUSLY?

585
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:09,482
YOU GUYS ARE JERKS.

586
00:14:09,482 --> 00:14:10,150
>> JESSIE--

587
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,651
>> NO, LIKE, I DO SO MUCH STUFF

588
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:12,652
FOR YOU, AND THEN YOU'RE

589
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:13,653
GONNA SAY I'M NOT GONNA

590
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:14,721
BE IN THE ROOM.

591
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,389
>> I WANT YOU IN THE ROOM.

592
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:18,058
I'M SAYING BRIAN DISCUSSED

593
00:14:18,058 --> 00:14:18,758
ME AND HIM--

594
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:19,592
>> BRIAN DOESN'T WANT ME

595
00:14:19,592 --> 00:14:20,427
IN THE ROOM.

596
00:14:20,427 --> 00:14:21,561
>> BECAUSE HE FEELS THAT IT'S,

597
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:22,862
LIKE, THE LAST MOMENT ME AND HIM

598
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,797
WILL JUST, LIKE, BE TOGETHER.

599
00:14:24,797 --> 00:14:25,632
>> OKAY, FINE.

600
00:14:25,632 --> 00:14:28,635
HAVE YOUR LAST MOMENT.

601
00:14:36,309 --> 00:14:39,012
>> JESS?

602
00:14:39,012 --> 00:14:40,580
>> YOUR LIFE PRETTY MUCH

603
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,349
REVOLVES AROUND HIM.

604
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:43,783
>> NO, IT DOESN'T.

605
00:14:43,783 --> 00:14:45,285
>> YEAH, IT DOES.

606
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:45,986
>> NO, IT REVOLVES AROUND

607
00:14:45,986 --> 00:14:49,089
MY BABY.

608
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:51,724
>> WELL, MAKE YOUR DECISION.

609
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:06,573
>> MY SISTER IS REALLY UPSET

610
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:07,907
THAT BRIAN DOESN'T WANT HER

611
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,409
IN THE DELIVERY ROOM,

612
00:15:09,409 --> 00:15:10,510
AND THINGS IN THE HOUSE

613
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:12,012
ARE EVEN MORE TENSE.

614
00:15:12,012 --> 00:15:13,813
>> SO YOU GUYS DOING OKAY?

615
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:15,148
>> WELL, I WAS MAD.

616
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:16,016
>> YEAH, I KNOW, AND I DON'T

617
00:15:16,016 --> 00:15:17,417
WANT YOU MAD AT ME.

618
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,085
>> I DON'T THINK

619
00:15:18,085 --> 00:15:18,885
YOU'RE JUST MAD.

620
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:20,053
>> I'M HURT.

621
00:15:20,053 --> 00:15:21,021
>> YEAH.

622
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:21,821
>> WELL, 'CAUSE I DON'T SEE

623
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:22,555
WHY THINGS SHOULD CHANGE.

624
00:15:22,555 --> 00:15:23,690
>> THEY NEED TIME FOR

625
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:24,891
THE THREE OF THEM TO BOND

626
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:26,359
TOGETHER AS A FAMILY.

627
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:27,527
>> IT'S JUST HARD FOR BRIAN

628
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:28,695
BECAUSE BRIAN'S NEVER DONE

629
00:15:28,695 --> 00:15:30,530
ANY FAMILY INTERACTION,

630
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,498
LIKE, HOW ME AND YOU WERE

631
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:32,499
ALWAYS TOGETHER.

632
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:33,500
>> HE JUST HAS TO GET USED

633
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,703
TO IT.

634
00:15:36,703 --> 00:15:38,105
>> YOU'RE NOT GONNA LOSE ME.

635
00:15:38,105 --> 00:15:39,439
>> YOU NEED TO MEET ME

636
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:40,440
IN THE MIDDLE.

637
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,275
LIKE, YOU GUYS ARE SO CLOSE.

638
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,643
IT'S HARD FOR ME AND JORDAN

639
00:15:43,643 --> 00:15:45,045
TO BE AS CLOSE.

640
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:47,214
>> SO, JESSIE, HOW ARE YOU DOING

641
00:15:47,214 --> 00:15:48,715
WITH ALL THIS NOW?

642
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:50,550
>> I AM GONNA GIVE YOU SPACE.

643
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:51,384
>> I DON'T WANT YOU TO, LIKE,

644
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:53,053
GIVE ME, LIKE, A TON OF SPACE.

645
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:54,221
I JUST WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND,

646
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:56,056
LIKE, I JUST GOT TO MEET BRIAN

647
00:15:56,056 --> 00:15:57,390
IN THE MIDDLE TOO, BECAUSE IF

648
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,558
I DO EVERYTHING I WANT,

649
00:15:58,558 --> 00:16:00,227
HOW IS THAT FAIR TO BRIAN?

650
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:01,394
>> YEAH.

651
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:02,729
>> I HOPE WE CAN WORK THIS OUT,

652
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:03,896
BECAUSE THE LAST THING I WANT

653
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:06,199
TO DO IS HURT MY SISTER.

654
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:11,271
YOU HAVE TO WORK ALL THE WAY

655
00:16:11,271 --> 00:16:12,672
TILL 8:00?

656
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:13,340
>> YEAH.

657
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,541
>> I'M GONNA MISS YOU.

658
00:16:14,541 --> 00:16:15,875
MY DUE DATE IS ONLY

659
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,044
A MONTH AWAY.

660
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:17,710
>> LOVE YOU.

661
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:18,878
>> BRIAN IS WORKING AS MUCH

662
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:20,347
AS POSSIBLE BEFORE HE STARTS

663
00:16:20,347 --> 00:16:21,914
COLLEGE, AND I'M TRYING TO TAKE

664
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:23,983
THE G.E.D. BEFORE I GIVE BIRTH.

665
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:24,951
>> YOU NERVOUS?

666
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:25,785
>> A LITTLE NERVOUS BECAUSE

667
00:16:25,785 --> 00:16:26,619
I THINK IT WOULD BE EASIER

668
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:27,954
IF I DID IT NOW INSTEAD OF WHEN

669
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:29,356
HE'S, LIKE, HERE.

670
00:16:29,356 --> 00:16:30,223
>> I'M VERY GLAD WE DON'T HAVE

671
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:31,858
THAT TIMELINE.

672
00:16:31,858 --> 00:16:32,859
>> YEAH, I DON'T KNOW HOW

673
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:34,694
YOU DO IT, JORDAN.

674
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:35,528
WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE DONE

675
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:36,863
WITH SCHOOL IF YOU HADN'T HAVE

676
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:38,331
ENDED UP PREGNANT?

677
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,166
>> I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE GONE

678
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,333
BACK INTO MODELING.

679
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,168
>> YEAH.

680
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:42,202

JESS, HAVE YOU DECIDED WHAT

IF YOU START BLEEDING

745
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:16,996
OR IF YOUR WATER BREAKS.

746
00:18:16,996 --> 00:18:17,797
OKAY.

747
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:18,465

THAT NOT HAVING MY SISTER HERE

753
00:18:32,044 --> 00:18:35,615
JUST DOESN'T FEEL RIGHT.

754
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:36,949
I'VE DECIDED I WANT MY SISTER

755
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,451
IN THE DELIVERY ROOM.

756
00:18:38,451 --> 00:18:40,453
>> WE TALKED ABOUT IT.

757
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,988
>> BUT I WANT HER IN THE ROOM.

758
00:18:41,988 --> 00:18:43,190
>> WHY?

759
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,191
>> 'CAUSE SHE'S MY TWIN SISTER,

760
00:18:44,191 --> 00:18:45,525
AND I WOULD LIKE HER TO, LIKE,

761
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:48,094
BE THERE AND SUPPORT US.

762
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:49,296
>> SUPPORT US? 

763
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:50,163
I'M THERE.

764
00:18:50,163 --> 00:18:50,830
I HAVE PLENTY--

765
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:51,664
>> I'M PUSHING A BABY OUT.

766
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:53,700
I WANT HER THERE TO SUPPORT ME.

767
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,302
>> OKAY, WHAT ABOUT WHAT I WANT?

768
00:18:55,302 --> 00:18:56,135
>> EITHER WAY, ONE OF US

769
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,304
ISN'T GONNA GET WHAT THEY WANT,

770
00:18:57,304 --> 00:18:58,538
AND I WANT HER THERE,

771
00:18:58,538 --> 00:18:59,372
AND I WANT HER TO TAKE PICTURES

772
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:00,373
AND VIDEO.

773
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:01,374
>> SOMETIMES YOU GOT TO MAKE

774
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:03,243
SACRIFICES.

775
00:19:03,243 --> 00:19:05,111
>> WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

776
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:07,113
>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU BEING

777
00:19:07,113 --> 00:19:09,449
IN THE ROOM WHEN I GIVE BIRTH.

778
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:10,450
>> WELL, BRIAN DOESN'T WANT ME

779
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:11,784
THERE, OBVIOUSLY.

780
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:13,286
JERK.

781
00:19:13,286 --> 00:19:15,722
>> WELL, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

782
00:19:15,722 --> 00:19:16,723
>> YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND

783
00:19:16,723 --> 00:19:17,890
OVER THIS WAY EITHER.

784
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:18,891
>> UM, I UNDERSTAND PERFECTLY.

785
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:20,059
>> YOU'RE NOT A TWIN.

786
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,728
>> WHY CAN'T YOU JUST, LIKE,

787
00:19:21,728 --> 00:19:23,396
REALIZE THAT SHE'S BEEN THROUGH,

788
00:19:23,396 --> 00:19:24,397
LIKE, EVERYTHING WITH ME?

789
00:19:24,397 --> 00:19:26,065
>> BUT HOW IS THE MOMENT

790
00:19:26,065 --> 00:19:27,400
SUPPOSED TO BE SPECIAL BETWEEN

791
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,067
ME AND YOU IF EVERYBODY

792
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:28,735
IS IN THE ROOM?

793
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:29,869
>> IT'S STILL GONNA BE SPECIAL.

794
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:30,870
WHAT, YOU WANT ME TO SAY

795
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:34,441
NO ONE CAN BE IN THE ROOM?

796
00:19:34,441 --> 00:19:35,542
OH, MY GOSH.

797
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:36,376
>> ALL RIGHT, SHE CAN BE

798
00:19:36,376 --> 00:19:39,078
IN THE BIRTH ROOM.

799
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:39,912
>> AND YOU'RE GONNA BE MAD AT ME

800
00:19:39,912 --> 00:19:40,580
ABOUT IT.

801
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:41,381
>> OKAY, EITHER WAY, SOMEONE

802
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:42,882
IS GONNA BE MAD.

803
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:45,218
YOU SAID IT.

804
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:46,052
I GUESS IT'S BETTER

805
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:48,355
THAT I'M MAD.

806
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:01,167
>> EVEN THOUGH BRIAN WAS UPSET

807
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:02,369
ABOUT ME WANTING MY SISTER

808
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:04,371
IN THE DELIVERY ROOM,

809
00:20:04,371 --> 00:20:05,204
HE GOT OVER IT QUICK.

810
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,506
POOR LITTLE GUY.

811
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:08,174
AND I'M GLAD, BECAUSE THIS BABY

812
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:10,176
IS DUE ANY MINUTE.

813
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:11,110
>> IT'S NICE TO HAVE TIME

814
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:11,778
OFF WORK.

815
00:20:11,778 --> 00:20:12,579
>> FINALLY GET TO SPEND

816
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:14,080
SOME TIME WITH YOU.

817
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:14,914
>> IT'S GONNA BE THE LAST TIME

818
00:20:14,914 --> 00:20:15,748
WE GET TO HANG OUT, JUST ME

819
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:16,583
AND YOU, BEFORE THE BABY

820
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:17,750
IS BORN.

821
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,018
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

822
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:21,187
>> NO ANYBODY BUT ME AND YOU.

823
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:22,021

>> I LOVE YOU.

828
00:20:28,361 --> 00:20:30,330
>> I LOVE YOU.

829
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:33,666
>> I COULD GO INTO LABOR

830
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,335
AT ANY MOMENT, AND I'M TOO

831
00:20:35,335 --> 00:20:36,669
UNCOMFORTABLE TO EVEN LEAVE

832
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:37,337
THE HOUSE.

833
00:20:37,337 --> 00:20:38,170
>> I WISH YOU WERE ACTUALLY

834
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,339
GOING TO THE GAME.

835
00:20:39,339 --> 00:20:40,573
>> YEAH.

>> YEAH.

838
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:42,842
>> DO YOU WISH YOU WERE GOING

839
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:44,010
JUST TO HANG OUT WITH EVERYBODY?

840
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:44,844
>> LIKE YOU USED TO.

841
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:46,045
>> YEAH.

IT'S PROBABLY TIME FOR US TO GO.

846
00:20:53,686 --> 00:20:55,355
>> SEE YA.

847
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:56,155

>> IT'S A GOOD THING

850
00:21:06,466 --> 00:21:07,467
I DIDN'T GO TO THE GAME

851
00:21:07,467 --> 00:21:09,135
WITH MY SISTER BECAUSE I'M

852
00:21:09,135 --> 00:21:11,804
HAVING THE WORST BACK PAIN.

853
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:13,139
I'M HAVING, LIKE, CONTRACTIONS,

00:21:14,474 --> 00:21:15,608
AND IT'S CAUSING MY BACK

856
00:21:15,608 --> 00:21:18,244
TO HURT, LIKE, MY PELVIS AREA.

857
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:19,245

00:21:19,245 --> 00:21:20,580
UNCOMFORTABLE AND THEY'RE THAT

859
00:21:20,580 --> 00:21:21,914
REGULAR, YOU PROBABLY NEED

00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,729
BLESS YOU.

1311
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:26,665
THERE'S BEEN VERY LITTLE SLEEP

1312
00:34:26,665 --> 00:34:30,035
AND LOTS OF NOAH CRYING.

1313
00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:33,004
>> [crying]

1314
00:34:35,707 --> 00:34:36,708
>> WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

1315
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:40,979
>> TO SCHOOL.

1316
00:34:40,979 --> 00:34:42,148
>> WHILE MY SISTER GETS TO GO

1317
00:34:42,148 --> 00:34:43,149
TO SCHOOL AND HANG OUT

1318
00:34:43,149 --> 00:34:46,552
WITH OUR FRIENDS,

1319
00:34:46,552 --> 00:34:48,487
I'M STUCK AT HOME.

1320
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:50,156
BRIAN HAS BEEN GOING TO WORK

1321
00:34:50,156 --> 00:34:51,990
AND IS NOW STARTING COLLEGE.

1322
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:53,325
>> I GOT TO GET GOING.

1323
00:34:53,325 --> 00:34:54,526
>> REALLY?

1324
00:34:54,526 --> 00:34:57,062
>> LOVE YOU.

1325
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:59,064
>> NOAH CRIES AND SPITS UP

1326
00:34:59,064 --> 00:35:01,066
CONSTANTLY.

1327
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:01,900
>> [coughs]

1328
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:02,734
>> I'M GONNA USE YOUR TOWEL.

1329
00:35:02,734 --> 00:35:04,069
LIKE THAT.

1330
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:06,037
HEY?

1331
00:35:09,641 --> 00:35:12,611
[Noah fussing]

1332
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:19,418
[Noah fussing]

1333
00:35:19,418 --> 00:35:20,419
I'M STARTING TO WORRY

1334
00:35:20,419 --> 00:35:21,587
THAT SOMETHING MIGHT BE WRONG

1335
00:35:21,587 --> 00:35:22,688
WITH NOAH.

1336
00:35:22,688 --> 00:35:24,390
SO I MADE A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT

1337
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,224
SO WE CAN FIND OUT WHAT'S

1338
00:35:25,224 --> 00:35:26,057
GOING ON.

1339
00:35:26,057 --> 00:35:26,892
>> ARE YOU GONNA DRIVE JORDAN

1340
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:27,726
TO THE DOCTOR?

1341
00:35:27,726 --> 00:35:29,295
BECAUSE I HAVE CLASS.

1342
00:35:29,295 --> 00:35:31,163
>> YEAH, I'LL TAKE HER.

1343
00:35:31,163 --> 00:35:32,164
>> JUST MAKE SURE YOU TELL THEM,

1344
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:33,665
LIKE, HE'S BEEN SCREAMING

1345
00:35:33,665 --> 00:35:36,034
FOR FIVE WEEKS.

1346
00:35:36,034 --> 00:35:37,536
I GOT TO GET GOING.

1347
00:35:37,536 --> 00:35:38,537
>> GOOD-BYE, BRIAN.

1348
00:35:38,537 --> 00:35:40,206
>> SEE YOU LATER.

1349
00:35:40,206 --> 00:35:41,340
>> I'M GLAD THINGS ARE BETTER

1350
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,741
WITH MY SISTER BECAUSE I REALLY

1351
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:44,410
NEED HER, ESPECIALLY WHEN BRIAN

1352
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:45,277
IS NOT AROUND.

1353
00:35:45,277 --> 00:35:46,445
LIKE, I LOOK AT EVERYONE ELSE'S

1354
00:35:46,445 --> 00:35:47,446
BABY, AND THEIR BABIES ARE ALL,

1355
00:35:47,446 --> 00:35:48,780
LIKE, HAPPY AND DON'T CRY

1356
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,715
VERY MUCH.

1357
00:35:49,715 --> 00:35:52,484
AND HE, LIKE, SCREAMS IN PAIN

1358
00:35:52,484 --> 00:35:54,486
AND DOESN'T SMILE VERY MUCH,

1359
00:35:54,486 --> 00:35:56,388
EXCEPT FOR IN HIS SLEEP.

1360
00:35:56,388 --> 00:35:57,889
I'M GONNA FIX WHATEVER IS WRONG

1361
00:35:57,889 --> 00:36:00,859
WITH YOU.

1362
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,897
WHEN NOAH GOT CHECKED OUT,

1363
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:07,399
WE LEARNED THAT HE HAS SEVERE

1364
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:09,067
ACID REFLUX.

1365
00:36:09,067 --> 00:36:10,402
ACID REFLUX HAPPENS WHEN

1366
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:11,903
WHATEVER YOU EAT GETS PUSHED UP

1367
00:36:11,903 --> 00:36:13,572
OUT OF YOUR STOMACH AND UP INTO

1368
00:36:13,572 --> 00:36:15,073
YOUR THROAT, AND IT REALLY

1369
00:36:15,073 --> 00:36:16,242
HURTS, WHICH IS WHAT'S MAKING

1370
00:36:16,242 --> 00:36:17,809
HIM CRY CONSTANTLY.

1371
00:36:17,809 --> 00:36:20,279
THEY SENT US TO THE HOSPITAL

1372
00:36:20,279 --> 00:36:21,447
IMMEDIATELY TO GET HIM

1373
00:36:21,447 --> 00:36:24,015
MEDICATION THROUGH AN I.V.,

1374
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:26,252
AND THAT WAS SCARY ENOUGH THAT

1375
00:36:26,252 --> 00:36:29,521
I NEEDED EVERYONE BY MY SIDE.

1376
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:32,958
[Noah crying]

1377
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:36,061
[monitor beeping]

1378
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,531
[Noah crying]

1379
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,032
I HATE SEEING HIM CRY BECAUSE

1380
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:43,201
HE'S IN PAIN OR HE'S GOT

1381
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:45,971
A NEEDLE IN HIS ARM.

1382
00:36:45,971 --> 00:36:48,640
[Noah crying]

1383
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:49,475
LIKE, WHEN HE FIGHTS ME

1384
00:36:49,475 --> 00:36:51,577
LIKE THIS...

1385
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:13,899
>> THE MEDICINE FINALLY

1386
00:37:13,899 --> 00:37:15,467
KICKED IN, AND NOAH STARTED

1387
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:17,202
TO CALM DOWN, BUT WE'RE STILL

1388
00:37:17,202 --> 00:37:18,404
NOT EXACTLY SURE WHAT'S

1389
00:37:18,404 --> 00:37:19,371
GOING ON.

1390
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:20,706
HELLO.

1391
00:37:20,706 --> 00:37:21,540
>> HI.

1392

[Noah crying]

1393
00:37:22,374 --> 00:37:23,909
OH, NOAH.

1394
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,944
BABIES WITH REFLUX ARE PROBABLY

1395
00:37:25,944 --> 00:37:27,313
GONNA BE A LITTLE BIT MORE

1396
00:37:27,313 --> 00:37:28,747
HIGH-MAINTENANCE OR HIGH-NEEDS

1397
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,382
BABIES THAN BABIES WITHOUT

1398
00:37:30,382 --> 00:37:31,116
REFLUX.

1399
00:37:31,116 --> 00:37:31,783
BUT WE SHOULD BE ABLE

1400
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:33,852
TO MAKE IT BETTER, OKAY?

1401
00:37:33,852 --> 00:37:35,020
HE'S NOT GONNA BE, LIKE,

1402
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:36,355
SO EASY, BUT WE SHOULD

1403
00:37:36,355 --> 00:37:37,856
MAKE IT BETTER, SO THAT

1404
00:37:37,856 --> 00:37:39,691
YOU'RE NOT CONSTANTLY DEALING

1405
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:41,192
WITH A BABY WHO IS UNHAPPY

1406
00:37:41,192 --> 00:37:42,794
AND FUSSY AND CRANKY.

1407
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:44,763
>> THANK YOU.

1408
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:48,199
THE NEXT MORNING, THE DOCTOR

1409
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,535
DISCHARGED NOAH.

1410
00:37:49,535 --> 00:37:50,369
THANK YOU.

1411
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:52,871
>> GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

1412
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:54,039
>> SHE RECOMMENDED A NEW

1413
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:55,541
FORMULA, AND WE HAVE TO GIVE

1414
00:37:55,541 --> 00:37:57,376
HIM MEDICINE, BUT I'M SO

1415
00:37:57,376 --> 00:38:00,011
RELIEVED THAT HE'S OKAY.

1416
00:38:03,582 --> 00:38:04,950
BRIAN AND I ARE STILL TRYING

1417
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,552
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO BALANCE

1418
00:38:06,552 --> 00:38:07,553
PARENTING WITH HIS SCHOOL

1419
00:38:07,553 --> 00:38:08,654
AND WORK.

1420
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:09,488
>> HELLO.

1421
00:38:09,488 --> 00:38:10,656

1422
00:38:10,656 --> 00:38:13,124
>> HEY, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1423
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:14,793
>> TAKING CARE OF THE BABY.

1424
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,962
HE'S VERY CRABBY.

1425
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:18,497
>> HA.

1426
00:38:18,497 --> 00:38:19,498
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1427
00:38:19,498 --> 00:38:21,567
>> I'M STUDYING IN THE LIBRARY.

1428
00:38:21,567 --> 00:38:23,234
>> WHEN WILL YOU BE HOME?

1429
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:24,235
>> UM, I DON'T KNOW.

1430
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:26,071
I THINK I HAVE TO WORK TONIGHT,

1431
00:38:26,071 --> 00:38:27,272
SO PROBABLY LATE.

1432
00:38:27,272 --> 00:38:28,273
>> ALL RIGHT, WELL, I'LL TALK

1433
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:29,608

LIKE, I DON'T HAVE

1444
00:38:43,355 --> 00:38:45,090
ALL THOSE OPTIONS.

1445
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:45,924
>> WELL, DON'T WORRY.

1446
00:38:45,924 --> 00:38:46,758
I WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE

1447
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:48,527
OF ALL MY OPTIONS FOR YOU.

1448
00:38:48,527 --> 00:38:51,062
>> JUST, LIKE, DON'T MESS IT UP.

1449

>> I KNOW.

1450
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:53,432
I'M NOT GOING TO.

1451
00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:54,933
>> BETTER NOT, OR I'LL WHUP YOU.

1452
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:57,569
[laughs]

1453
00:38:59,838 --> 00:39:03,174
THE PAST, LIKE, YEAR OF MY LIFE

1454
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:04,910
HAS BEEN, LIKE, CRAZY.

1455
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:07,078
I THOUGHT BEING A MOM...

1456
00:39:07,078 --> 00:39:08,246
OH, IT WON'T BE HARD.

1457
00:39:08,246 --> 00:39:09,247
I'LL WAKE UP A COUPLE TIMES

1458
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:10,649
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

1459
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:13,452
NO, 'CAUSE NOAH HAS ACID REFLUX,

1460
00:39:13,452 --> 00:39:16,121
SO IT'S, LIKE, A COLICKY BABY

1461
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:19,124
ALL DAY LONG.

1462
00:39:19,124 --> 00:39:20,459
IT'S HARD NOT SEEING BRIAN,

1463
00:39:20,459 --> 00:39:22,394
'CAUSE HE'S WORKING ALL DAY

1464
00:39:22,394 --> 00:39:24,062
AND GOING TO SCHOOL ALL DAY.

1465
00:39:24,062 --> 00:39:25,230
I KNOW HE'S DOING IT FOR ME

1466
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:26,632
AND NOAH.

1467
00:39:26,632 --> 00:39:28,299
>> CAN YOU SMILE?

1468
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:29,935
SMILE.

1469
00:39:29,935 --> 00:39:32,704
>> HE DOES SUCH A GOOD JOB.

1470
00:39:32,704 --> 00:39:34,039
LIKE, THAT'S A TRUE MAN

1471
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,707
RIGHT THERE.

1472
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:37,275
WHEN I WAS PREGNANT,

1473
00:39:37,275 --> 00:39:39,077
IT WAS BEYOND STRESSFUL,

1474
00:39:39,077 --> 00:39:40,746
BALANCING JESSICA AND BRIAN,

1475
00:39:40,746 --> 00:39:41,913
TRYING TO, LIKE, EVEN MY TIME

1476
00:39:41,913 --> 00:39:43,682
OUT WITH BOTH OF THEM.

1477
00:39:43,682 --> 00:39:45,250
>> AW, ARE YOU UPSET?

1478
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:45,917
>> TELL HIM TO STOP,

1479
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:46,752
BEFORE I GET A KNIFE

1480
00:39:46,752 --> 00:39:48,920
AND STAB HIM.

1481
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,088
>> IT WAS, LIKE, ONE OF THE

1482
00:39:50,088 --> 00:39:51,923
HARDEST NINE MONTHS OF MY LIFE.

1483
00:39:51,923 --> 00:39:53,692
FEELING NAUSEOUS...

1484
00:39:53,692 --> 00:39:54,693
IT WAS JUST VERY DIFFICULT--

1485
00:39:54,693 --> 00:39:56,027
AND WATCHING MY BODY CHANGE

1486
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:57,529
SO MUCH, 'CAUSE YOU GET

1487
00:39:57,529 --> 00:39:58,363
STRETCH MARKS.

1488
00:39:58,363 --> 00:39:59,130
IT'S NOT FUN.

1489
00:39:59,130 --> 00:39:59,965
>> SO LET'S TALK ABOUT

1490
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:00,766
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO

1491
00:40:00,766 --> 00:40:01,433
FOR BIRTH CONTROL.

1492
00:40:01,433 --> 00:40:02,233
>> OKAY.

1493
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:02,901
>> DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING

1494
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:03,569
IN MIND?

1495
00:40:03,569 --> 00:40:04,235
>> I JUST WANTED TO GET

1496
00:40:04,235 --> 00:40:05,737
ON THE PILL, AND I'LL STICK

1497
00:40:05,737 --> 00:40:07,639
WITH THAT FOR A VERY LONG TIME

1498
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:08,974
AND MAKE SURE I DO IT EXACTLY

1499
00:40:08,974 --> 00:40:09,975
RIGHT.

1500
00:40:09,975 --> 00:40:10,809
>> YOU KNOW, IF YOU SKIP A PILL

1501
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:11,743
HERE AND THERE, YOU KNOW,

1502
00:40:11,743 --> 00:40:12,911
YOU'RE REALLY SETTING YOURSELF

1503
00:40:12,911 --> 00:40:14,245
UP FOR SOME ACCIDENTS.

1504
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,582
>> YEAH, NO MORE OF THOSE.

1505
00:40:16,582 --> 00:40:18,249
>> SO--OKAY, GOOD.

1506
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:19,751
>> I LOVE BEING A MOM,

1507
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:23,088
EVEN THE SCREAMING, THE REFLUX,

1508
00:40:23,088 --> 00:40:24,255
ALL OF THE TIME BEING IN

1509
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:25,256
THE HOSPITAL.

1510
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,725
I DON'T REGRET ANY OF IT.

1511
00:40:26,725 --> 00:40:28,393
I MEAN, HE'S WORTH IT,

1512
00:40:28,393 --> 00:40:30,729
BUT I WISH I WAS OLDER,

1513
00:40:30,729 --> 00:40:32,063
I ALREADY HAD MY EDUCATION

1514
00:40:32,063 --> 00:40:32,898
TAKEN CARE OF.

1515
00:40:32,898 --> 00:40:33,899
I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY

1516
00:40:33,899 --> 00:40:35,133
ABOUT ALL THAT.

1517
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:37,636
I GAVE UP JUST, LIKE, FREEDOM.

1518
00:40:37,636 --> 00:40:39,471
LIKE, I GAVE UP MODELING.

1519
00:40:39,471 --> 00:40:40,639
I GAVE UP NOT PLANNING

1520
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:42,307
FOR MY FUTURE.

1521
00:40:42,307 --> 00:40:44,309
LIKE, HE WAS BORN, AND IT WAS

1522
00:40:44,309 --> 00:40:46,144
PRETTY MUCH PLANNED OUT FOR ME.

1523
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:48,446
NOAH.

1524
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:49,615
>> * BUT IT'LL FLY YOU

1525
00:40:49,615 --> 00:40:50,616
* LIKE A KITE

1526
00:40:50,616 --> 00:40:51,783
* IT'LL THROW YOU

1527
00:40:51,783 --> 00:40:55,787
* TO THE GROUND

1528
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,455
* BUT THAT'S THE BEST THING

1529
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,424
* I HAVE FOUND

1530
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:05,797
>> IS IT SCARY KNOWING

1531
00:41:05,797 --> 00:41:06,598
TWO ARE COMING?

1532
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:07,599
>> YEAH, IT SCARED ME WHEN

1533
00:41:07,599 --> 00:41:08,834
I FIRST FOUND OUT.

1534
00:41:08,834 --> 00:41:10,268
>> YOU'RE ONLY 16 YEARS OLD.

1535
00:41:10,268 --> 00:41:12,437
AND IF HE DOESN'T GET THAT,

1536
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:13,438
WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE

1537
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:14,606
TO BUMP HEADS.

1538
00:41:14,606 --> 00:41:16,775
YOU NEED TO MEET ME HALFWAY!

1539
00:41:16,775 --> 00:41:17,776
>> THEY'RE NOT YOUR KIDS.

1540
00:41:17,776 --> 00:41:18,844
I DON'T HAVE TO MEET YOU

1541
00:41:18,844 --> 00:41:20,746
HALFWAY.

1542
00:41:20,746 --> 00:41:21,580
>> THIS IS SOMETHING YOUR DAD

1543
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,414
SHOULD BE HELPING OUT ON.

1544
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:24,082
>> DO YOU WANT OUT OF THIS

1545
00:41:24,082 --> 00:41:24,816
RELATIONSHIP, JENNIFER?

1546
00:41:24,816 --> 00:41:26,417
>> YEAH, I DO.

1547
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,587
THAT'S CALLED KIDNAPPING!

1548
00:41:28,587 --> 00:41:29,855
THINK ABOUT YOUR KIDS, JOSH!

1549
00:41:29,855 --> 00:41:32,223
YOU WILL NEVER SEE THEM AGAIN!
