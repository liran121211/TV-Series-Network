[lively rock music]

2
00:00:03,471 --> 00:00:05,173
>> I WANT A WORM TOO.

3
00:00:05,173 --> 00:00:07,375
HEY, I THINK I DO HAVE A FISH.

4
00:00:07,375 --> 00:00:08,209
MY NAME IS BROOKE.

5
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:09,877
I'M 16, AND I'M FROM MANSFIELD,

6
00:00:09,877 --> 00:00:12,012
TEXAS, A SUBURB OF FORT WORTH.

7
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,182
I LIVE WITH MY MOM, DAD,

8
00:00:14,182 --> 00:00:15,283
LITTLE BROTHER, TREY,

9
00:00:15,283 --> 00:00:17,285
AND A HERD OF GOATS.

10
00:00:17,285 --> 00:00:18,452
I'M A JUNIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL,

11
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:19,787
BUT I'M NOT YOUR AVERAGE

12
00:00:19,787 --> 00:00:22,290
16-YEAR-OLD, BECAUSE I WAS

13
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:23,757
BORN TO RACE.

14
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:25,593
MY WHOLE FAMILY LOVES RACING,

15
00:00:25,593 --> 00:00:26,594
AND I'VE BEEN DOING IT SINCE

16
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:27,761
I WAS SEVEN.

17
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:28,929
I'M AT THE TRACK ALMOST

18
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:30,064
EVERY WEEKEND.

19
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:30,731
LOVE YOU.

20
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:31,565
AND THAT'S WHERE I MET

21
00:00:31,565 --> 00:00:32,866
MY BOYFRIEND, CODY.

22
00:00:32,866 --> 00:00:33,634
BE CAREFUL.

23
00:00:33,634 --> 00:00:34,468
>> ALL RIGHT.

24
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:35,336
>> WE'VE BEEN DATING FOR TWO

25
00:00:35,336 --> 00:00:36,804
YEARS, AND THINGS HAVE BEEN

26
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:38,372
MOVING FAST.

27
00:00:38,372 --> 00:00:39,640
HE ASKED ME TO MARRY HIM,

28
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,142
AND I SAID YES.

29
00:00:41,142 --> 00:00:42,143
MY PARENTS ARE REALLY

30
00:00:42,143 --> 00:00:43,944
UNDERSTANDING BECAUSE THEY GOT

31
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:45,279
MARRIED WHEN THEY WERE YOUNG

32
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:47,281
TOO AND SO DID MY MOM'S MOM

33
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:49,483
AND MY MOM'S MOM'S MOM.

34
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:51,185
SO THEY LET CODY MOVE IN,

35
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:52,353
AND THINGS ARE ABOUT TO GET

36
00:00:52,353 --> 00:00:53,654
A LOT MORE CROWDED

37
00:00:53,654 --> 00:00:56,190
BECAUSE I'M PREGNANT.

38
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:04,898
SINCE WE'RE GETTING MARRIED,

39
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,734
MY PARENTS LET CODY MOVE IN,

40
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,068
SO WE CAN SAVE UP FOR OUR OWN

41
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:09,703
PLACE WHILE HE WORKS AT

42
00:01:09,703 --> 00:01:10,871
QUIKTRIP, THE LOCAL CONVENIENCE

43
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:12,039
STORE.

44
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,407
>> HOW MANY GOATS DO Y'ALL HAVE?

45
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,243
>> LIKE, 15.

46
00:01:15,243 --> 00:01:16,544
ONE THING MY PARENTS APPRECIATE

47
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:19,280
ABOUT CODY LIVING HERE,

48
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,581
HE HELPS OUT.

49
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:21,582
>> IS THIS ALL THAT Y'ALL

50
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:22,416
FEED THEM?

51
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:23,284
>> FOR NOW.

52
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:24,385
CODY AND I HAVE BEEN ENGAGED

53
00:01:24,385 --> 00:01:25,886
FOR TWO MONTHS, BUT TOMORROW,

54
00:01:25,886 --> 00:01:27,721
WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT OFFICIAL.

55
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:28,722
MY COUSIN EMALEE CAME DOWN

56
00:01:28,722 --> 00:01:30,391
FOR THE WEDDING, AND SHE'S DYING

57
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:32,059
TO HEAR HOW IT ALL WENT DOWN.

58
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:33,060
>> SO, CODY, HOW DID YOU FIND

59
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,295
OUT THAT BROOKE WAS PREGNANT?

60
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:35,296
>> WELL, I CAME BACK FROM

61
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:36,130
VACATION.

62
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:36,797
>> YEAH?

63
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:37,965
>> AND SHE CALLED ME THE NEXT

64
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:41,101
MORNING AND TOLD ME.

65
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:41,935
>> DID YOU BELIEVE ME...

66
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:42,603
>> NO, I DID NOT.

67
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:43,437
>> WHEN I CALLED YOU?

68
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:44,438
>> I DIDN'T REALLY BELIEVE YOU

69
00:01:44,438 --> 00:01:46,440
UNTIL THE NEXT--OR UNTIL YOU

70
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,610
SHOWED ME THE ACTUAL TESTS

71
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,344
AND KIND OF...

72
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:51,111
>> BUT YOU DIDN'T WANT

73
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:51,779
TO SEE THEM.

74
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:52,613
>> NO, I DID NOT.

75
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:53,614
>> SO IN YOUR HEAD, WHAT WAS

76
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:54,982
GOING ON?

77
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:56,484
>> I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT,

78
00:01:56,484 --> 00:01:57,651
YOU KNOW, LIKE, HOW I'M GONNA

79
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:00,488
BE A DAD IN NINE MONTHS

80
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:03,157
AND THEN HAVE A JOB AND...

81
00:02:03,157 --> 00:02:03,991
>> FINISH SCHOOL.

82
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:05,326
>> JUST--THEN, YEAH, AND THE

83
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:07,027
MAIN WORRY WAS HOW I WAS GONNA--

84
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:08,362
IF I WAS GONNA BE ABLE TO FINISH

85
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:09,530
SCHOOL OR NOT, SO...

86
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,031
>> SO ARE YOU EXCITED NOW?

87
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:12,866
>> YEAH, I'M HOPING IT'S A BOY.

88
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:14,202
[laughter]

89
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:18,539
>> I WANT IT TO BE A GIRL.

90
00:02:18,539 --> 00:02:19,540
EVEN THOUGH TOMORROW'S

91
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:21,209
MY WEDDING DAY, EVERYONE

92
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:22,643
IS GETTING THEIR CARS READY

93
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:23,644
FOR MY HONEYMOON AT THE

94
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:24,612
RACETRACK.

95
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:26,614
MY FAMILY RACES EVERY WEEKEND,

96
00:02:26,614 --> 00:02:28,549
BUT I CAN ALREADY TELL THIS

97
00:02:28,549 --> 00:02:30,050
SEASON IS GONNA BE DIFFERENT,

98
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,252
AT LEAST FOR ME.

99
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:32,420
WHAT ARE YOU DOING, DAD?

100
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:33,587
>> FIXING THE RACE CAR.

101
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:35,088
>> CAN I DO IT?

102
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:35,756
>> NOPE.

103
00:02:35,756 --> 00:02:36,424
>> WHY NOT?

104
00:02:36,424 --> 00:02:37,391
>> BECAUSE YOU'RE PREGNANT.

105
00:02:37,391 --> 00:02:38,226
>> BECAUSE I'M PREGNANT.

106
00:02:38,226 --> 00:02:39,393
THAT'S JUST RUDE.

107
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:40,728
[laughter]

108
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:41,729
>> YOU CAN'T DO NOTHING BUT

109
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:42,396
SIT IN THE STANDS--

110
00:02:42,396 --> 00:02:45,233
>> I CAN HOOK UP WIRES.

111
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:46,567
MY MOM HAS GIVEN ME AND CODY

112
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:47,901
HER BLESSING TO GET MARRIED,

113
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:49,237
BUT SHE'S STILL DISAPPOINTED

114
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:50,238
THAT I'M FOLLOWING IN HER

115
00:02:50,238 --> 00:02:52,072
FOOTSTEPS: PREGNANT AND MARRIED

116
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:53,241
IN MY TEENS.

117
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:54,074
>> HOW THE HELL DID YOU EVER

118
00:02:54,074 --> 00:02:55,443
EVEN GET PREGNANT, AS MODEST

119
00:02:55,443 --> 00:02:56,577
AS YOU ARE?

120
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:57,778
HOW DID CODY EVER EVEN

121
00:02:57,778 --> 00:02:59,447
SEE YOU NAKED TO START WITH?

122
00:02:59,447 --> 00:03:01,649
>> I DON'T KNOW, MOM.

123
00:03:01,649 --> 00:03:03,150
>> MAMA TRIED TO GIVE YOU EVERY

124
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:05,386
OPPORTUNITY TO PROTECT YOURSELF.

125
00:03:05,386 --> 00:03:07,388
>> I KNOW.

126
00:03:07,388 --> 00:03:08,656
>> THERE'S CONDOMS UNDER

127
00:03:08,656 --> 00:03:10,491
THE BATHROOM SINK.

128
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:11,925
FOR FREE!

129
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,427
I SHOWED YOU HOW TO PUT THEM ON

130
00:03:13,427 --> 00:03:15,095
A CUCUMBER.

131
00:03:15,095 --> 00:03:16,430
THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT YOU

132
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:18,098
KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON.

133
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:19,132
IT WASN'T 'CAUSE YOU WASN'T

134
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,167
EDUCATED.

135
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:20,868
>> I KNOW.

136
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,270
>> YOU WERE DEFINITELY EDUCATED.

137
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:23,271
>> MY MOM AND DAD ARE PAYING

138
00:03:23,271 --> 00:03:24,772
FOR MY ENTIRE WEDDING.

139
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:26,607
THEY'VE BEEN REALLY GENEROUS,

140
00:03:26,607 --> 00:03:27,575
BUT THEY COULD ONLY AFFORD

141
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:28,742
SO MUCH.

142
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:29,910
THEY'VE MADE IT CLEAR THEY CAN'T

143
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,245
JUST GIVE US MONEY FOR CHILD

144
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:33,847
CARE ONCE THE BABY COMES.

145
00:03:37,918 --> 00:03:38,586
>> TIME TO GET UP.

146
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:39,920
YOUR LAST DAY AS A SINGLE GIRL,

147
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:40,921
SO IT'S TIME TO GET UP

148
00:03:40,921 --> 00:03:41,755
AND GET GOING.

149
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:42,923
>> TODAY IS MY WEDDING DAY,

150
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:44,258
AND SINCE CODY AND I JUST GOT

151
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:46,126
ENGAGED A FEW WEEKS AGO,

152
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:47,295
I HAVEN'T HAD A CHANCE TO SEE

153
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:49,497
ANY OF MY GIRLFRIENDS YET.

154
00:03:49,497 --> 00:03:51,131
>> SO WHY ARE YOU AND CODY--

155
00:03:51,131 --> 00:03:52,300
LIKE, WHY DO Y'ALL WANT TO GET

156
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,534
MARRIED RIGHT NOW?

157
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:54,535
>> 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE FAT

158
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:55,703
AT MY WEDDING.

159
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:56,704
[laughter]

160
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:59,106
>> IT'S CALLED WORKING OUT.

161
00:03:59,106 --> 00:03:59,940
>> HOW DID YOU FIND OUT

162
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,108
THAT YOU WERE PREGNANT?

163
00:04:01,108 --> 00:04:01,942
>> I TOOK A TEST,

164
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:03,944
AND IT SAID YES.

165
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:05,112
>> DID YOU TAKE ONE TEST?

166
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:06,614
>> THREE TESTS.

167
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:08,282
>> THIRD TIME'S THE CHARM.

168
00:04:08,282 --> 00:04:09,450
[laughter]

169
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:10,651
>> NO, ALL THREE OF THEM

170
00:04:10,651 --> 00:04:12,786
SAID THE SAME THING.

171
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:15,289
I CALLED CODY WHEN I FOUND OUT.

172
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:16,490
HE TOLD ME HE WAS HUNGRY,

173
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,791
SO HE WAS GONNA GO EAT.

174
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,126
[laughter]

175
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:20,127
THAT'S ALL HE SAID.

176
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:20,861
>> GONNA CALL YOU BACK.

177
00:04:20,861 --> 00:04:21,962
>> THEN HE HUNG UP THE PHONE.

178
00:04:21,962 --> 00:04:23,297
>> HOW DID YOUR MOM FIND OUT?

179
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:25,633
>> BROOKE LEFT HER PHONE

180
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:28,302
ON THE TABLE AT NANA'S.

181
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:29,637
AND BROOKE KNOWS THAT I'M GONNA

182
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:30,504
READ HER TEXT MESSAGES.

183
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:31,104
I PAY THE BILL.

184
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:31,772
>> NO, I DON'T.

185
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:32,606
I FIGURED YOU TRUST ME.

186
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,376
IT'S STUPID.

187
00:04:35,376 --> 00:04:37,210
>> BUT I PAY THE BILL.

188
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:38,045
>> I DON'T CARE.

189
00:04:38,045 --> 00:04:39,713
>> SO I CAN, YOU KNOW,

190
00:04:39,713 --> 00:04:40,881
READ WHAT I WANT TO READ.

191
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:41,815
SO ANYWAY, I WAS LOOKING AT

192
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:42,983
HER TEXT MESSAGES, AND SHE HAD

193
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:45,152
BEEN TEXTING ONE OF HER FRIENDS,

194
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:47,154
AND HER FRIEND WAS LIKE,

195
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:48,055
"YOU HAVE TO TELL YOUR MOM."

196
00:04:48,055 --> 00:04:50,057
AND BROOKE'S TEXT BACK WAS,

197
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:51,559
"I KNOW. I WILL.

198
00:04:51,559 --> 00:04:53,694
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY."

199
00:04:53,694 --> 00:04:55,028
>> I WAS VERY SCARED.

200
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:56,764
>> I TOLD DAD, I SAID,

201
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:59,299
"GET OUT NOW."

202
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,834
>> AND CODY CAME BACK,

203
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,536
'CAUSE MOM CALLED HIM.

204
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:04,037
AND SHE ASKED US WHAT WE WERE

205
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,205
GONNA DO, AND HE WAS LIKE,

206
00:05:05,205 --> 00:05:06,374
"WE'RE GONNA GET MARRIED."

207
00:05:06,374 --> 00:05:07,375
AND I JUST LOOKED AT HIM.

208
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,376
I WAS LIKE, "WHERE DID THAT

209
00:05:08,376 --> 00:05:09,377
COME FROM?"

210
00:05:09,377 --> 00:05:11,712
I DID NOT SEE THAT ONE COMING.

211
00:05:11,712 --> 00:05:13,080
>> AND THAT BOY, HE DIDN'T

212
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,415
HESITATE ONE SECOND.

213
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:15,549
>> THAT'S GOOD.

214
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:16,249
IT MAKES ME HAPPY THAT

215
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:16,984
HE'S THERE FOR YOU.

216
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:17,818
>> YEAH.

217
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:18,819
>> YOU KNOW HE'S NOT GONNA

218
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:19,553
BE A DEADBEAT.

219
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:21,555
>> YEAH.

220
00:05:21,555 --> 00:05:22,556
IF THERE'S ONE THING I'M SURE

221
00:05:22,556 --> 00:05:24,224
OF, IT'S THAT CODY WOULD NEVER

222
00:05:24,224 --> 00:05:26,259
LEAVE ME OR HIS BABY.

223
00:05:26,259 --> 00:05:27,761
WE'RE IN LOVE, AND ALTHOUGH

224
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:28,762
WE DIDN'T PLAN ON GETTING

225
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,263
MARRIED SO SOON, WE'VE THOUGHT

226
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,733
ABOUT THIS DAY FOR A LONG TIME.

227
00:05:37,137 --> 00:05:38,506
WHERE ARE THE RINGS?

228
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:39,339
>> BROOKE.

229
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,674
>> THEY--I--THEY WERE

230
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:41,509
RIGHT THERE.

231
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:42,342
THEY'RE IN YOUR PURSE.

232
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,011
>> THEY'RE IN MY PURSE.

233
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:45,012
>> WHERE IS YOUR PURSE?

234
00:05:45,012 --> 00:05:45,779
>> IN THE TRUCK.

235
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,114
>> I'M REALLY NERVOUS, AND IT

236
00:05:47,114 --> 00:05:47,981
SEEMS LIKE THERE'S SO MUCH

237
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:48,949
TO DO.

238
00:05:48,949 --> 00:05:49,983
I WONDER HOW CODY'S DEALING

239
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:54,154
WITH ALL OF THIS.

240
00:05:54,154 --> 00:05:56,490
>> HEY!

241
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,825
>> SEE, THAT ONE LOOKS--

242
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:59,326
LOOK AT THIS.

243
00:05:59,326 --> 00:06:00,160
OF COURSE, WE WANTED

244
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,829
A RACE CAR THEME, AND THE

245
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,330
GROOM WAS DRESSED APPROPRIATELY.

246
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,832
I WANTED SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE

247
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:05,899
TRADITIONAL.

248
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,200
SUCK ALL THIS IN,

249
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,201
EVEN THOUGH I STILL HAVE

250
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,202
A BELLY.

251
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,838
I CAN'T SEE MY FEET.

252
00:06:10,838 --> 00:06:12,339
>> GET USED TO IT.

253
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,341
[laughter]

254
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:17,377
>> I KNEW THAT WAS COMING.

255
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,378
>> ARE YOU READY?

256
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,714
>> YEP.

257
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:21,381
>> YOU SURE?

258
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,550
>> YEP.

259
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,384
>> OKAY, GOOD LUCK, BABY.

260
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,553
>> GETTING MARRIED AT 16

261
00:06:25,553 --> 00:06:27,220
IS NOT WHAT I HAD PLANNED FOR

262
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:29,222
MY JUNIOR YEAR BUT NEITHER WAS

263
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:30,658
GETTING PREGNANT.

264
00:06:30,658 --> 00:06:34,662
>> DO YOU, CODY, TAKE THIS WOMAN

265
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:37,831
TO BE YOUR LAWFUL WEDDED WIFE?

266
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:38,666
>> I DO.

267
00:06:38,666 --> 00:06:40,534
>> DO YOU, BROOKE, IN LIKE

268
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:42,703
MANNER, SOLEMNLY AGREE TO

269
00:06:42,703 --> 00:06:44,204
RECEIVE THIS MAN AS YOUR LAWFUL

270
00:06:44,204 --> 00:06:45,539
WEDDED HUSBAND SO LONG AS

271
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:46,540
YOU BOTH SHALL LIVE?

272
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,908
>> I DO.

273
00:06:47,908 --> 00:06:50,578
>> CODY, ARE YOU READY?

274
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:51,745
>> YES, SIR.

275
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:52,913
>> I NOW PRONOUNCE YOU

276
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,247
HUSBAND AND WIFE.

277
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:58,318
YOU MAY KISS THE BRIDE.

278
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:01,254
[applause]

279
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:07,394
>> NOW.

280
00:07:07,394 --> 00:07:11,098
[cheering and yelling]

281
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,566
>> IT'S SUPPOSED TO BE LOVE,

282
00:07:12,566 --> 00:07:13,734
MARRIAGE, AND THEN A BABY

283
00:07:13,734 --> 00:07:15,402
CARRIAGE, BUT IT SEEMS LIKE

284
00:07:15,402 --> 00:07:16,904
WE'RE DOING IT ALL AT ONCE,

285
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:19,039
AND I HOPE WE'RE READY.

286
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,618
>> CODY AND I CAN'T AFFORD

287
00:07:30,618 --> 00:07:32,452
A REAL HONEYMOON, SO WE'RE GONNA

288
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,787
HONEYMOON AT THE RACETRACK.

289
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:34,855
>> I THINK THIS IS THE FIRST

290
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:35,889
TIME I'VE ACTUALLY SEEN THIS CAR

291
00:07:35,889 --> 00:07:36,890
CLEAN.

292
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:37,558
>> YEAH.

293
00:07:37,558 --> 00:07:38,391
>> YOU MISSED A SPOT.

294
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:39,827
>> WELL, YOU CAN WASH IT.

295
00:07:39,827 --> 00:07:40,994
>> I GOT MY OWN CAR TO WASH.

296
00:07:40,994 --> 00:07:41,995
I WASHED IT THE OTHER DAY.

297
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:42,830
>> THAT'S YOUR NEW JOB:

298
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,164
WASH YOUR CAR, WASH THIS CAR,

299
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,265
AND WASH TREY'S CAR.

300
00:07:45,265 --> 00:07:46,600
>> TONIGHT IS THE BOMBER A.M.A.,

301
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,935
THE FEATURE RACE.

302
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:49,269
AND CODY REALLY THINKS

303
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,604
HE CAN WIN IT, WHICH WOULD BE

304
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,439
NICE, BECAUSE WE COULD SURE USE

305
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,140
THE PRIZE MONEY.

306
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:53,974
>> WHO'S A BETTER DRIVER,

307
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:54,975
ME OR YOU?

308
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:55,809
>> ME.

309
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:56,644
>> BULL CRAP.

310
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:57,310
>> I AM.

311
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,311
>> NO, YOU'RE NOT.

312
00:07:58,311 --> 00:07:58,979
YOU SIT AROUND--

313
00:07:58,979 --> 00:07:59,813
>> YES, I AM.

314
00:07:59,813 --> 00:08:00,514
>> YOU HOLD YOUR LANE,

315
00:08:00,514 --> 00:08:01,649
AND YOU PUTT-PUTT AROUND.

316
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:03,617
>> I DO NOT PUTT-PUTT ANYMORE.

317
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:05,619
>> I STILL WENT AROUND YOU.

318
00:08:05,619 --> 00:08:07,287
>> NO, YOU DIDN'T.

319
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:08,622
>> YES, I DID.

320
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:09,623
>> I DON'T REMEMBER.

321
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:10,591
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET A VIDEO

322
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:12,526
TO SHOW ME.

323
00:08:15,696 --> 00:08:16,697
>> I STILL WANT THIS RING.

324
00:08:16,697 --> 00:08:17,598
>> THIS ONE OR THIS ONE?

325
00:08:17,598 --> 00:08:18,231
>> NO, THIS ONE.

326
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,066
I WANT THE ONE THAT'S GOT

327
00:08:19,066 --> 00:08:19,933
ALL THE MONEY BEHIND IT.

328
00:08:19,933 --> 00:08:21,268
[laughter]

329
00:08:21,268 --> 00:08:22,435
>> I LOVE BEING AT THE TRACK

330
00:08:22,435 --> 00:08:23,771
AND COMPETING AGAINST MY FRIENDS

331
00:08:23,771 --> 00:08:25,639
AND FAMILY, BUT GETTING PREGNANT

332
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:26,907
HAS TAKEN ME OUT FROM BEHIND

333
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:27,641
THE WHEEL.

334
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:28,742
I'M FORCED TO SIT OUT OF

335
00:08:28,742 --> 00:08:30,077
THE ENTIRE SEASON.

336
00:08:30,077 --> 00:08:31,411
WISH I COULD DO THAT.

337
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:32,412
>> I KNOW.

338
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:33,213
>> NOBODY WILL LET ME TOUCH

339
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:34,247
ANYTHING.

340
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,415
>> [laughs]

341
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:36,584
>> I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE WHO'S

342
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:38,251
SEASON IS COMING TO AN END.

343
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:40,087
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO BUILD

344
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:41,421
RACE CARS AND SAVE UP

345
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:42,255
FOR A BABY.

346
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:42,923
LOVE YOU.

347
00:08:42,923 --> 00:08:43,724
>> LOVE YOU TOO.

348
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:44,758
>> IF CODY DOESN'T WIN TONIGHT'S

349
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:46,760
PURSE, IT WILL BE HIS LAST RACE

350
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:49,362
FOR A LONG TIME.

351
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:57,104
WHAT IS HE DOING?

352
00:08:57,104 --> 00:08:57,871
WHAT THE HECK!

353
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,707
HE'S GOT A FLAT.

354
00:08:59,707 --> 00:09:02,209
CODY JUST BLEW AN $80 TIRE.

355
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:04,377
AND HIS CAR IS OUT OF THE RACE.

356
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,045
>> HEY.

357
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,213
>> NO, I'M JUST GONNA GET--

358
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,715
I'M OVER IT.

359
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:09,750
BUT MINE ISN'T.

360
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,919
MY DAD'S DRIVING OLD NUMBER 74

361
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:13,420
WHILE I'M OUT OF COMMISSION.

362
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,421
GO, DADDY, GO, DADDY,

363
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:15,589
GO, DADDY, GO!

364
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:16,757
GO, DADDY, GO, DADDY,

365
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:17,591
GO, DADDY, GO!

366
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:18,759
>> WHOO!

367
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:19,426
>> THE VICTORY LANE

368
00:09:19,426 --> 00:09:21,428
TO NUMBER 74!

369
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:22,930
>> YAY!

370
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:23,764
>> YEAH!

371
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:24,598
>> THAT WAS AWESOME.

372
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:27,267
>> BROOKE, YOU DID WELL BUILDING

373
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:28,435
THAT CAR FOR YOUR DADDY

374
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:29,269
TO DRIVE.

375
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:30,771
THE BROOKE-MOBILE BACK IN

376
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,105
VICTORY LANE!

377
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:33,140
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WISH THEM

378
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:35,142
A HAPPY MARRIAGE FOR HER

379
00:09:35,142 --> 00:09:35,976
AND CODY AS THEY WALK DOWN

380
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:37,310
THE FRONT STRAIGHTAWAY.

381
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,478
THEY GOT MARRIED LAST NIGHT.

382
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:39,647
THEY'RE 16 YEARS OLD,

383
00:09:39,647 --> 00:09:40,513
AND THEY'RE GONNA NEED ALL

384
00:09:40,513 --> 00:09:42,315
THE PRAYERS THEY CAN GET, GUYS,

385
00:09:42,315 --> 00:09:43,483
AS THEY WAIT ON THAT YOUNG ONE

386
00:09:43,483 --> 00:09:44,351
THAT'S GOING TO COME ALONG

387
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:45,018
WITH THEM.

388
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:45,853
THEY'RE GONNA NEED ALL

389
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:47,354
THE PRAYERS THEY CAN GET.

390
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:48,355
>> WELL, YOUR DAD CUTS THE

391
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:49,189
RACE CAR OFF.

392
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:50,691
CODY HAS TO FUND YOUR CAR NOW.

393
00:09:50,691 --> 00:09:51,625
>> YEP.

394
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,492
>> WELL, I HOPE HE'S MAKING

395
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:54,194
SOME GOOD MONEY TO FUND

396
00:09:54,194 --> 00:09:56,029
TWO RACE CARS AND A KID

397
00:09:56,029 --> 00:09:58,231
AND SUPPORT YOU.

398
00:09:58,231 --> 00:09:59,099
>> BUT SHE'S NOT LIVING ON

399
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,000
MAMA'S MONEY NO MORE, BECAUSE

400
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,201
I SIGNED THE MARRIAGE LICENSE.

401
00:10:01,201 --> 00:10:02,369
AND AS I SIGNED THE MARRIAGE

402
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:03,536
LICENSE, I ZIPPED THE WALLET

403
00:10:03,536 --> 00:10:04,604
CLOSED.

404
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,939
[laughter]

405
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,274
>> LOOKS LIKE ME AND CODY WON'T

406
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,877
BE RACING AGAIN ANY TIME SOON.

407
00:10:14,181 --> 00:10:15,182
I'M CRUISING THROUGH MY JUNIOR

408
00:10:15,182 --> 00:10:16,516
YEAR, BUT I'M ABOUT TO TAKE OFF

409
00:10:16,516 --> 00:10:18,051
FOR TWO MONTHS TO HAVE THIS

410
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:19,386
BABY, SO I CAN'T AFFORD TO

411
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:20,721
FALL BEHIND.

412
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:21,889
MY SCHOOL HAS A TEEN PARENTING

413
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:23,256
PROGRAM WHERE I CAN LEARN FROM

414
00:10:23,256 --> 00:10:24,925
OTHER TEEN MOMS ABOUT JUGGLING

415
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:26,760
MOTHERHOOD AND SCHOOLWORK.

416
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:29,262
>> SHE WAKES UP AT 5:06

417
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:29,930
EVERY MORNING.

418
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,832
>> OH, GOD.

419
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:32,700
IS IT HARD FOR Y'ALL'S

420
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,400
SCHOOLWORK?

421
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,567
>> I TAKE HER TO THE DAY CARE

422
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:35,568
IN THE MORNING, AND THEN IF

423
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,070
I HAVE HOMEWORK, I WON'T PICK

424
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,071
HER UP RIGHT AWAY RIGHT AFTER

425
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:38,806
SCHOOL.

426
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:39,807
I'LL GO HOME AND DO MY HOMEWORK.

427
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:41,074
AND I STARTED OUT REALLY ROCKY,

428
00:10:41,074 --> 00:10:42,575
AND THEN NOW I HAVE ALL "A"s

429
00:10:42,575 --> 00:10:43,677
AND STUFF.

430
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:45,345
>> I HOPE THAT'S HOW I AM.

431
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:46,680
LISTENING TO THE OTHER MOMS

432
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,581
MAKES ME REALIZE JUST HOW HARD

433
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,083
GRADUATING IS GONNA BE,

434
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:51,885
ESPECIALLY SINCE I HAVE TO

435
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:53,553
DEPEND ON CODY GRADUATING FIRST

436
00:10:53,553 --> 00:10:55,856
SO HE CAN TAKE CARE OF THE BABY.

437
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:56,589
WHERE IS YOUR HOMEWORK?

438
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:57,290
I KNOW YOU HAVE SOME.

439
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,158
>> I DON'T HAVE HOMEWORK.

440
00:10:58,158 --> 00:10:59,927
>> YOU'RE LYING.

441
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:02,162
WHERE'S YOUR ENGLISH STUFF?

442
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,496
>> I DON'T HAVE ANY HOMEWORK

443
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,865
FOR ENGLISH.

444
00:11:04,865 --> 00:11:05,833
>> 'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T TURN IN

445
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:06,566
THE LAST STUFF YOU WERE

446
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:07,334
SUPPOSED TO.

447
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:08,702
WHY DIDN'T YOU FINISH THAT?

448
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:09,602
>> I DON'T WANT TO READ ABOUT

449
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:10,203
ANYTHING.

450
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:12,205
CODY DOES NOT READ.

451
00:11:12,205 --> 00:11:14,074
>> WHETHER CODY READS OR NOT,

452
00:11:14,074 --> 00:11:15,909
HE'S GONNA HAVE TO BUCKLE DOWN.

453
00:11:15,909 --> 00:11:17,244
HE HAS TO GRADUATE EARLY

454
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:19,079
IN JANUARY SO HE CAN WATCH OUR

455
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,748
BABY WHILE I FINISH MY JUNIOR

456
00:11:20,748 --> 00:11:22,582
YEAR, BUT IT'S NOT LOOKING GOOD.

457
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:23,583
HE'S MISSING A TON OF

458
00:11:23,583 --> 00:11:25,252
ASSIGNMENTS AND HAS FAILED

459
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:26,586
ONE OF HIS FINAL EXAMS

460
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:28,088
THREE TIMES ALREADY,

461
00:11:28,088 --> 00:11:29,422
WHICH HE'S NOT GONNA GET AWAY

462
00:11:29,422 --> 00:11:30,590
WITH, BECAUSE MY MOM WORKS

463
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,092
AT OUR SCHOOL.

464
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:33,493
>> I AM SIGNING ON TO THE

465
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:34,661
INTERNET TO LOOK UP CODY'S

466
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:35,662
GRADES.

467
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:36,764
>> OH, GOD.

468
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:37,630
>> WHY ARE YOU "OH, GODDING"?

469
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:39,332
WHAT AM I FIXING TO FIND?

470
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:41,902
OKAY, ENGLISH 4, YOU'RE MISSING

471
00:11:41,902 --> 00:11:44,004
YOUR FRANKENSTEIN STUDY GUIDE.

472
00:11:44,004 --> 00:11:44,905
GET A PENCIL AND WRITE THIS

473
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:45,906
STUFF DOWN.

474
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:46,573
ECONOMICS.

475
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:48,008
>> ECO.

476
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:49,342
>> YOUR TWO ADDITIONAL

477
00:11:49,342 --> 00:11:51,011
BODY PARAGRAPHS.

478
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:51,945
>> THAT'S WHAT I DON'T GET,

479
00:11:51,945 --> 00:11:52,679
'CAUSE I HAD--

480
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:53,981
>> WRITE THEM DOWN.

481
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:55,648
OKAY, YOU NEED TO ASK IF YOU

482
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:56,984
CAN REDO THE PROFILE OF

483
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:58,651
THE UNITED STATES.

484
00:11:58,651 --> 00:11:59,486
THESE THAT YOU'RE GETTING

485
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:01,154
ZEROES IN, YOU CAN'T GET ZEROES.

486
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:03,056
YOU DON'T HAVE TIME FOR ZEROES.

487
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:04,391
>> I HOPE MY MOM CAN MOTIVATE

488
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,059
CODY TO GRADUATE EARLY, BECAUSE

489
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,195
IF HE DOESN'T, I'LL HAVE TO DROP

490
00:12:08,195 --> 00:12:11,865
OUT AND STAY HOME WITH THE BABY.

491
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:12,866
WITH SO MUCH OF OUR FUTURE

492
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:14,534
UP IN THE AIR, I AT LEAST WANTED

493
00:12:14,534 --> 00:12:15,535
TO KNOW IF WE WERE HAVING

494
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:16,703
A BOY OR A GIRL.

495
00:12:16,703 --> 00:12:18,205
SO TODAY, WE'RE HEADED TO

496
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:20,207
THE DOCTOR TO FIND OUT.

497
00:12:20,207 --> 00:12:21,041
>> [giggles]

498
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,976
WHEN I WAS PREGNANT WITH YOU,

499
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,544
I DREAMED THAT I HAD A LITTLE

500
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:25,745
BABY POODLE.

501
00:12:25,745 --> 00:12:26,579
[laughter]

502
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,448
I DRESSED IT--I DRESSED IT

503
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:30,517
IN LITTLE DRESSES.

504
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:32,185
>> OH, MY GOD.

505
00:12:32,185 --> 00:12:33,854
WHAT DO YOU WANT IT TO BE?

506
00:12:33,854 --> 00:12:35,422
>> AT FIRST, I WANTED A GIRL.

507
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:37,257
AND I DECIDED, IF IT'S A BOY,

508
00:12:37,257 --> 00:12:39,827
THAT'S GOOD TOO.

509
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:40,994
>> OKAY, BROOKE, I'M GONNA HAVE

510
00:12:40,994 --> 00:12:41,995
YOU LIE DOWN ON THE STRETCHER

511
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:43,730
RIGHT ON YOUR BACK.

512
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,731
ALL RIGHT.

513
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:45,732
YOU READY FOR THE JELLY?

514
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:46,733
HERE WE GO.

515
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:47,567
THIS IS IT.

516
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:50,403
>> OH, IT'S COLD.

517
00:12:50,403 --> 00:12:51,604
>> HERE WE GO.

518
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,273
HAVE YOU CHOSEN ANY NAMES YET

519
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,107
FOR THE BABY?

520
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,275
>> YES, IF IT'S A BOY,

521
00:12:55,275 --> 00:12:56,109
IT'S BRODY.

522
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,144
>> YEAH?

523
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:57,945
>> AND IF IT'S A GIRL,

524
00:12:57,945 --> 00:12:59,012
IT'S EMMA.

525
00:12:59,012 --> 00:13:00,848
>> EMMA, I LOVE EMMA.

526
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:02,182
BUT IT'S A BOY.

527
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:05,218
>> OH, MY GOD.

528
00:13:05,218 --> 00:13:06,153
>> HERE'S THE MOUTH.

529
00:13:06,153 --> 00:13:07,387
>> BIG LIPS.

530
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:08,555
[laughter]

531
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:10,824
GOT CODY'S BIG LIPS.

532
00:13:10,824 --> 00:13:12,659
>> WE'RE NAMING OUR BOY BRODY

533
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:14,161
BECAUSE WE HOPE HE'S THE PERFECT

534
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:16,496
COMBINATION OF THE TWO OF US.

535
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:17,530
WE WANT TO GET OUR OWN PLACE

536
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,366
TO LIVE BEFORE BRODY GETS HERE,

537
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:20,700
BUT WITH CODY'S INCOME FROM

538
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:22,535
QUIKTRIP, IT'S GONNA HAVE TO BE

539
00:13:22,535 --> 00:13:27,540
DIRT CHEAP.

540
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,876
MY PARENTS HAVE BEEN LETTING US

541
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:30,077
DO THE CLEANING INSTEAD OF

542
00:13:30,077 --> 00:13:31,912
PAYING RENT BUT ONLY ON THE

543
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:33,914
CONDITION THAT WE BOTH GRADUATE

544
00:13:33,914 --> 00:13:35,248
HIGH SCHOOL, AND THAT DOESN'T

545
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:36,249
LOOK PROMISING.

546
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:37,584
DID YOU EVEN GO TO SCHOOL TODAY?

547
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:39,186
>> YES, I WENT TO SCHOOL TODAY.

548
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,020
>> GEEZ.

549
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,888
>> JUST 'CAUSE I OVERSLEPT

550
00:13:40,888 --> 00:13:41,721
THE OTHER DAY...

551
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:43,223
>> YEAH, AND DIDN'T GO.

552
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:44,057
YOU'VE GOT TO STOP THAT.

553
00:13:44,057 --> 00:13:45,225
YOU NEED TO START GOING TO BED

554
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:46,059
EARLIER.

555
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:46,793
THAT WAY, YOU CAN GET UP

556
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:47,394
EARLIER.

557
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:48,261
>> NO.

558
00:13:48,261 --> 00:13:49,829
>> HAVE YOU TALKED TO THE

559
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,164
COUNSELORS ABOUT YOU GRADUATING

560
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,066
EARLY ANYMORE?

561
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:54,501
>> I'M ALREADY A MIDTERM GRAD.

562
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:55,835
>> I KNOW, BUT ARE YOUR GRADES

563
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,070
GOOD ENOUGH TO BE A MIDTERM

564
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:57,770
GRAD?

565
00:13:57,770 --> 00:13:58,771
>> YES.

566
00:13:58,771 --> 00:13:59,772
>> THEY ARE?

567
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:00,673
>> YES.

568
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,075
>> CODY, LAST TIME I CHECKED,

569
00:14:02,075 --> 00:14:03,343
YOU HAD A 60 SOMETHING IN THAT

570
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,611
ENGLISH CLASS.

571
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:05,612
>> I HAVE A 72, THANK YOU

572
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:06,613
VERY MUCH.

573
00:14:06,613 --> 00:14:07,447
>> OKAY, WELL, IT NEEDS TO BE

574
00:14:07,447 --> 00:14:08,448
HIGHER THAN A 72.

575
00:14:08,448 --> 00:14:09,282
>> NO.

576
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:09,983
>> YEAH.

577
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:10,984
DO YOU NOT REMEMBER WHAT I SAID

578
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:11,985
AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR?

579
00:14:11,985 --> 00:14:12,652
>> NO.

580
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:13,653
>> IF IT'S LOWER THAN AN 80,

581
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:14,821
YOU'RE GOING TO TUTORING.

582
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:15,822
>> I HAVEN'T GONE TO TUTORING

583
00:14:15,822 --> 00:14:16,823
SINCE I WAS IN THE FOURTH GRADE.

584
00:14:16,823 --> 00:14:17,991
>> YOU HAVE TO GRADUATE IN

585
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:19,326
DECEMBER SO THAT YOU'LL BE HERE

586
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:22,829
FOR THE BABY IN FEBRUARY.

587
00:14:22,829 --> 00:14:24,497
RUNNING AWAY FROM OUR SITUATION

588
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:28,001
IS NOT A GOOD SIGN,

589
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:29,169
'CAUSE WE HAVEN'T EVEN GOTTEN

590
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:30,170
TO THE HARD PART YET.

591
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,139
>> [grunts]

592
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:40,147
>> MY FAMILY LIKES TO SPEND

593
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:41,949
A LOT OF TIME OUTDOORS.

594
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:43,416
WE GET OUT CAMPING WHENEVER

595
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,417
WE CAN.

596
00:14:44,417 --> 00:14:45,752
AS SOON AS BRODY'S OLD ENOUGH

597
00:14:45,752 --> 00:14:47,587
TO CRAWL OR EVEN EARLIER,

598
00:14:47,587 --> 00:14:48,755
HE'S GONNA BE SLEEPING IN

599
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:49,589
A TENT.

600
00:14:49,589 --> 00:14:50,490
>> LAY ON IT AND SEE IF IT'S

601
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:51,591
GONNA BE COMFORTABLE ENOUGH.

602
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,260
[laughter]

603
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,594
>> IT WAS SCARY.

604
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:55,628
YES.

605
00:14:55,628 --> 00:14:56,629
BUT WE'LL EVENTUALLY WANT

606
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,631
A REAL HOUSE TO SLEEP IN.

607
00:14:58,631 --> 00:14:59,799
MY PARENTS HAVE OFFERED US

608
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,134
A LITTLE PATCH OF THEIR LAND

609
00:15:01,134 --> 00:15:02,635
TO PUT A PLACE OF OUR OWN,

610
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:03,803
AND SINCE WE CAN'T AFFORD MUCH

611
00:15:03,803 --> 00:15:05,472
WHILE I'M STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL,

612
00:15:05,472 --> 00:15:06,339
WE'RE THINKING ABOUT BUYING

613
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:08,141
A PREFABRICATED BARN.

614
00:15:08,141 --> 00:15:09,809
>> I AM VERY READY FOR YOU GUYS

615
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:10,643
TO GET YOUR OWN PLACE.

616
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,479
YOU GUYS HAVE FILLED UP

617
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:13,613
THE HOUSE.

618
00:15:13,613 --> 00:15:14,447
>> WHY ARE Y'ALL LOOKING

619
00:15:14,447 --> 00:15:16,116
AT BARNS, LIKE...

620
00:15:16,116 --> 00:15:16,984
>> YOU KNOW, THAT WAY, THEY CAN

621
00:15:16,984 --> 00:15:17,951
SAY, YOU KNOW, WHEN SOMEBODY

622
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:18,952
ASKS BRODY, "WERE YOU BORN

623
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:19,953
IN A BARN?"

624
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:21,321
HE CAN SAY YEAH.

625
00:15:21,321 --> 00:15:22,855
>> YEAH.

626
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:23,656
>> IF YOU TAKE ONE OF THESE

627
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:25,758
WITH THE UPSTAIRS, YOU COULD

628
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,994
MAKE, LIKE, THE UPSTAIRS BE

629
00:15:26,994 --> 00:15:28,595
THE BEDROOM AND THEN THE

630
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:31,098
DOWNSTAIRS A LITTLE--

631
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:32,765
LIKE A KITCHENETTE TYPE,

632
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,434
LITTLE-BITTY KITCHEN.

633
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:35,602
AND IT'S SMALL ENOUGH THAT

634
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:37,604
WE CAN PUT IT ON OUR LAND,

635
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,006
SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO BUY LAND.

636
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:40,007
YEAH.

637
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:41,008
>> IT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH

638
00:15:41,008 --> 00:15:43,010
CODY MAKES, ON HOW MUCH WE COULD

639
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,144
PAY EVERY MONTH.

640
00:15:44,144 --> 00:15:45,012
>> YOU'LL MAKE IT.

641
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:46,679
WE DID.

642
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:48,181
IT'S NOT EASY.

643
00:15:48,181 --> 00:15:49,182
YOU'RE NOT GONNA APPRECIATE

644
00:15:49,182 --> 00:15:50,183
WHAT YOU HAVE IF YOU DON'T

645
00:15:50,183 --> 00:15:53,353
WORK FOR IT.

646
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:54,487
>> ARE YOU READY TO GO TO BED?

647
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:55,322
>> LET'S GO.

648
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:56,656
>> GOOD NIGHT, SWEETHEART.

649
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:58,325
>> GOOD NIGHT, MOM.

650
00:15:58,325 --> 00:16:01,828
IT IS FREEZING.

651
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:03,163
AFTER WE BROKE UP CAMP,

652
00:16:03,163 --> 00:16:04,497
I CONVINCED CODY TO GO LOOK

653
00:16:04,497 --> 00:16:05,498
AT BARNS.

654
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:06,666
HE THINKS IT'S A SILLY IDEA,

655
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,001
BUT I REALLY THINK IT'S

656
00:16:08,001 --> 00:16:09,036
THE WAY TO GO.

657
00:16:09,036 --> 00:16:09,802
>> WHY DO YOU WANT A BARN

658
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:11,138
TO LIVE IN?

659
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:14,041
>> I THINK THEY'RE CUTE.

660
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:14,807
>> WELL...

661
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,044
>> AND THEY'RE NOT EXPENSIVE--

662
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:19,046
WELL, NOT THAT EXPENSIVE--

663
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:21,048
AS A REAL HOUSE WOULD BE.

664
00:16:21,048 --> 00:16:22,282
>> I KNOW, BUT...

665
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:24,051
>> AND WE CAN PUT IT ON MOM

666
00:16:24,051 --> 00:16:24,817
AND DAD'S LAND.

667
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:25,652
THAT WAY, WE CAN STILL HAVE

668
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,321
A POND IN OUR BACKYARD.

669
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,556
>> YOU KILL ME.

670
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:31,491
>> I KNOW.

671
00:16:35,428 --> 00:16:36,429
>> Y'ALL ARE PRETTY EXCITED

672
00:16:36,429 --> 00:16:37,430
ABOUT THE BABY COMING?

673
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,098
>> YEAH.

674
00:16:38,098 --> 00:16:38,765
>> YES.

675
00:16:38,765 --> 00:16:39,599
>> TRYING TO SPOIL THAT THING

676
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:40,567
ROTTEN.

677
00:16:40,567 --> 00:16:41,734
ALL RIGHT, AND AS YOU COME

678
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:43,103
INSIDE, IT KIND OF OPENS UP.

679
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:43,903
WE DON'T HAVE THIS ONE

680
00:16:43,903 --> 00:16:44,904
FINISHED OUT.

681
00:16:44,904 --> 00:16:46,239
AND IT COMES STANDARD WITH

682
00:16:46,239 --> 00:16:47,740
THE WINDOWS, THE NINE-LIGHT DOOR

683
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:48,741
THAT YOU SEE HERE,

684
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:49,909
AND IT COMES STANDARD WITH

685
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:51,344
THE STAIRCASE.

686
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,245
AND THIS IS KIND OF THE UPSTAIRS

687
00:16:52,245 --> 00:16:53,246
WHERE THEY TYPICALLY USE

688
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:54,114
THE BEDROOMS.

689
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:54,914
WE TYPICALLY WILL DO

690
00:16:54,914 --> 00:16:55,915
A ONE BEDROOM UP HERE.

691
00:16:55,915 --> 00:16:56,916
>> I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

692
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,585
IT'S THE PERFECT SIZE.

693
00:16:58,585 --> 00:16:59,752
>> IT'S PRETTY NICE, I MEAN,

694
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:01,788
AND IT'S AFFORDABLE,

695
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:03,290
WHICH IS WHAT MOST PEOPLE...

696
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,624
HEY, IT'S NOT LIKE BUILDING

697
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:05,825
A $200,000 HOUSE THAT

698
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:07,660
TIES YOU DOWN.

699
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,661
>> LIKE, HOW MUCH WOULD A BASIC

700
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:10,230
PAYMENT JUST BE FOR THE SHELL?

701
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:14,567
>> IF YOU DID THE $25,000,

702
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:16,403
AND THEN WE GOT THE STANDARD TAX

703
00:17:16,403 --> 00:17:17,770
THAT'S ON THERE AS WELL,

704
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:19,772
SAY YOU WANTED TO GO 72 MONTHS,

705
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:22,142
YOU'D BE ABOUT $416 A MONTH.

706
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:23,876
IF YOU WANTED IT COMPLETELY

707
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,145
FINISHED OUT, NORMALLY,

708
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:26,713
IT WOULD BE ABOUT $35,000.

709
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:27,947
72.

710
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:31,284
THAT'S ABOUT $555 A MONTH.

711
00:17:31,284 --> 00:17:34,754
ALL RIGHTY.

712
00:17:34,754 --> 00:17:36,156
>> THERE'S NO WAY WE CAN AFFORD

713
00:17:36,156 --> 00:17:37,290
THIS BARN ON WHAT CODY MAKES

714
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,658
AT QUIKTRIP.

715
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:39,992
HE PROPOSED A PLAN TO MAKE IT

716
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:41,828
WORK.

717
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:43,996
>> I'M GONNA WORK FULL-TIME.

718
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:45,898
I'M GONNA WORK IN THE EVENINGS.

719
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:46,566
>> NO.

720
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,401
I'M TRYING TO TELL YOU THAT

721
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,104
THE FACT IS, IF YOU DO THAT,

722
00:17:51,104 --> 00:17:52,105
AND I HAVE TO STAY UP WITH

723
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:53,773
THE BABY AT NIGHT, THAT I'M NOT

724
00:17:53,773 --> 00:17:55,608
GONNA GRADUATE.

725
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:56,709
>> YES, YOU WILL.

726
00:17:56,709 --> 00:17:57,710
>> NO, I WON'T, NOT IF I HAVE

727
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,045
TO STAY UP WITH HIM ALL NIGHT

728
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:01,047
AND I CAN'T SLEEP,

729
00:18:01,047 --> 00:18:03,550
AND THEN I HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL.

730
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,884
>> THAT JOB'S NOT GONNA BE THERE

731
00:18:04,884 --> 00:18:06,319
FOREVER.

732
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:08,988
>> LIKE, ME GRADUATING IS?

733
00:18:08,988 --> 00:18:11,658
>> YEAH, YOU CAN GET YOUR G.E.D.

734
00:18:11,658 --> 00:18:13,993
>> NO, I WANT TO GRADUATE.

735
00:18:13,993 --> 00:18:15,027
>> YOU WILL--

736
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,029
I'M JUST DONE TALKING WITH YOU.

737
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:18,198
>> WHY ARE YOU ACTING LIKE THIS,

738
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:20,600
CODY?

739
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:21,468
>> BECAUSE I'M SITTING HERE

740
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:22,602
TRYING TO PROVIDE FOR A FAMILY,

741
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:23,470
AND YOU'RE JUST TELLING ME,

742
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,271
"HEY, TURN IT DOWN."

743
00:18:24,271 --> 00:18:25,438
>> NO, I'M NOT.

744
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:26,273
I'M SAYING THAT I NEED

745
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:28,408
TO GRADUATE.

746
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:29,242
>> WE'RE NOT GONNA MAKE IT

747
00:18:29,242 --> 00:18:30,743
ON MY $8.25 AN HOUR.

748
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:31,944

A DIPLOMA?

751
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,948
>> OKAY, FINE.

752
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:36,949
IF ANYTHING LIKE THAT COMES

753
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:38,351
ALONG, I'LL DENY IT.

CODY DOES, BUT I'M NOT GIVING UP

757
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:44,557

AND REALLY UNCOMFORTABLE.

766

CODY HAS NO SYMPATHY,

767
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:01,341
SO I THOUGHT I'D BRING HIM

768
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:02,309
A SURPRISE.

775
00:19:11,718 --> 00:19:12,885
THIS PREGNANCY SUIT GIVES CODY

CODY HAS TO SETTLE DOWN AND DO

IS MORE REALISTIC ABOUT THE

850

857
00:21:18,144 --> 00:21:19,312
BUT I'M COUNTING ON CODY

858
00:21:19,312 --> 00:21:20,146
TO DO THAT.

HE'S TAKEN IT LOTS OF TIMES

862
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:28,355
AND HASN'T PASSED IT YET,

863
00:21:28,355 --> 00:21:29,221
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM STUDY

864
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:30,357
MUCH THIS WEEKEND.

>> WELL, IF HE DOESN'T PASS

867
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:34,561
THE TEST, THEN Y'ALL HAVE

868
00:21:34,561 --> 00:21:35,395
TO PAY FOR DAY CARE.

869
00:21:35,395 --> 00:21:36,396
ME AND DAD CAN'T HELP YOU.

I CAN'T BE NEGATIVE.

873
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:42,935
I HAVE TO HAVE FAITH IN HIM.

874

>> AT SOME POINT, THOUGH,

875
00:21:44,036 --> 00:21:45,204
YOU HAVE TO HAVE A BACKUP PLAN.

876
00:21:45,204 --> 00:21:47,306
>> WELL, I DON'T RIGHT NOW.

877
00:21:59,085 --> 00:22:00,252

TODAY FOR A FEW HOURS BECAUSE

879
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:03,423
IT'S MY BABY SHOWER.

881
00:22:04,924 --> 00:22:06,759
TO THE BABY SHOWERS NOW?

882
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:08,260

I LIKE IT.

I KNOW CODY DOESN'T WANT

896
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,146
TO COME, BUT HE'S GONNA HAVE

897
00:22:27,146 --> 00:22:28,481
TO DEAL WITH IT, BECAUSE WE NEED

898
00:22:28,481 --> 00:22:29,982

>> OHH...

910
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:53,573
>> THAT WAS FUN.

911
00:22:53,573 --> 00:22:54,741
>> I'M GLAD MY MOM AND DAD ARE

912
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:56,075
COOL WITH US STAYING IN THEIR

OUR OWN PLACE YET,

915
00:22:58,745 --> 00:22:59,646
BUT I THINK THEY'RE STARTING

916
00:22:59,646 --> 00:23:00,680
TO REGRET IT.

917
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,281
>> WOW.

918

LET'S MOVE STUFF WHEREVER

920
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,122
WE CAN, AND THEN WE'LL FIGURE

921
00:23:10,122 --> 00:23:11,624

922
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:13,392
THE STUFF INTO YOUR ROOM.

GOING IN MY ROOM?

930
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:24,303
Y'ALL ARE HAVING A BABY,

931
00:23:24,303 --> 00:23:26,439

ROLL TO THE END OF THE BED

937
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:36,883
AND KICK IT.

938
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:37,617
>> MM.

939
00:23:37,617 --> 00:23:38,985
JUST MAKE IT SWAY FROM SIDE

940
00:23:38,985 --> 00:23:39,819
TO SIDE.

941
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:40,487
>> RIGHT.

942
00:23:40,487 --> 00:23:41,320
>> CODY IS TAKING HIS TEST

943
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,822
AFTER SCHOOL TODAY, AND I'M

944
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:43,990
TRYING TO KEEP MY MIND OFF

945
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,824
OF IT.

946
00:23:44,824 --> 00:23:45,825
IT MAY SEEM LIKE I HAVE A TON

947
00:23:45,825 --> 00:23:47,494
OF STUFF FOR BRODY, BUT THERE

948
00:23:47,494 --> 00:23:48,495
ARE STILL THINGS WE NEED.

949
00:23:48,495 --> 00:23:50,329
I CAN'T DRIVE FOR SIX WEEKS

950
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:51,598
AFTER I HAVE HIM, SO...

951
00:23:51,598 --> 00:23:52,264
>> GOOD.

952
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,500
MAYBE YOU'LL BE SAFE.

953
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,601
>> CODY HAS TO TAKE ME AND BRODY

954
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:55,602
TO SCHOOL.

955
00:23:55,602 --> 00:23:57,103
[laughter]

956
00:23:57,103 --> 00:23:58,270
THAT'S WEIRD.

957
00:23:58,270 --> 00:23:59,105
>> AND THEN HE HAS TO GO PICK

958
00:23:59,105 --> 00:24:00,673
THE KIDS UP.

959
00:24:00,673 --> 00:24:01,674
>> 'CAUSE HE'S ALREADY GONNA BE

960
00:24:01,674 --> 00:24:03,543
GRADUATED, AND SO HE'S GONNA

961
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:04,877
BE LONELY AT HOME.

962
00:24:04,877 --> 00:24:05,878
>> I KNOW.

963
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:06,813
>> YEAH, RIGHT, HE'S GONNA SIT

964
00:24:06,813 --> 00:24:07,780
THERE AND PLAY XBOX ALL DAY.

965
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:09,381
>> ONLY IF HE GRADUATES.

966
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:10,049
>> HE BETTER.

967
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:11,651
>> HE BETTER GRADUATE.

968
00:24:11,651 --> 00:24:12,418
>> Y'ALL HAVE TO PRAY

969
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:13,319
EVERY DAY.

970
00:24:13,319 --> 00:24:14,554
>> LET'S PRAY RIGHT NOW.

971
00:24:14,554 --> 00:24:15,555
>> THAT BOY NEEDS MORE THAN

972
00:24:15,555 --> 00:24:16,656
PRAYERS.

973
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:21,293
>> THAT BOY NEEDS A MIRACLE.

974
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:22,629
>> "MY KIDS ROCK."

975
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:23,796
>> CODY SHOULD BE DONE WITH

976
00:24:23,796 --> 00:24:24,964
HIS TEST BY NOW.

977
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:26,132
I KEPT WATCHING MY PHONE FOR

978
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:27,667
WHEN THE TEST RESULTS WOULD COME

979
00:24:27,667 --> 00:24:30,837
WHEN I FINALLY GOT CODY'S TEXT.

980
00:24:30,837 --> 00:24:32,171
HE PASSED.

981
00:24:32,171 --> 00:24:33,840
I CAN FINALLY BREATHE A LITTLE.

982
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,508
CODY WILL GRADUATE EARLY,

983
00:24:35,508 --> 00:24:36,909
AND I'LL BE ABLE TO FINISH

984
00:24:36,909 --> 00:24:39,546
MY JUNIOR YEAR RIGHT ON TIME.

985
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:40,379
>> ARE YOU EXCITED FOR YOUR

986
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:41,548
GRADUATION PARTY?

987
00:24:41,548 --> 00:24:42,348
>> YEAH, BECAUSE NOW--

988
00:24:42,348 --> 00:24:43,115
>> SUPPOSED TO BE A LOT OF

989
00:24:43,115 --> 00:24:43,883
PEOPLE HERE.

990
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:44,984
>> YEAH, I'M EXCITED BECAUSE

991
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,986
I DON'T HAVE TO WAKE UP AT 6:15

992
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:48,688
TO GO TO SCHOOL ANYMORE.

993
00:24:48,688 --> 00:24:49,822
GOOD, THANK YOU.

994
00:24:49,822 --> 00:24:50,557
>> YAY.

995
00:24:50,557 --> 00:24:51,658
>> HELLO, LADYBUG!

996
00:24:51,658 --> 00:24:52,491
>> AH!

997
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:53,492
>> I LOVE YOU.

998
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:54,160
>> LOVE YOU TOO.

999
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,294
>> EVERYTHING'S FOR THE BABY.

1000
00:24:55,294 --> 00:24:55,962
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

1001
00:24:55,962 --> 00:24:57,296
THE SACRIFICES ARE THE BEST.

1002
00:24:57,296 --> 00:24:58,130
>> THAT'S WHY HE GRADUATED

1003
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,065
EARLY, SO THAT I COULD FINISH

1004
00:24:59,065 --> 00:25:00,399
SCHOOL AND HE COULD GET UP.

1005
00:25:00,399 --> 00:25:01,834
>> YEAH.

1006
00:25:01,834 --> 00:25:02,501
>> HEY.

1007
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,169
>> YEAH?

1008
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:03,936
>> I'M PROUD OF YOU.

1009
00:25:03,936 --> 00:25:04,503
>> THANK YOU.

1010
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:05,171
>> GIVE ME A KISS.

1011
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:06,005
>> MM.

1012
00:25:06,005 --> 00:25:09,175
>> THANK YOU.

1013
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:10,176
WE ARE GETTING EVERYTHING

1014
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:13,345
READY FOR BRODY'S ARRIVAL.

1015
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:14,681
DAD HAS TO TRY TO PUT MY

1016
00:25:14,681 --> 00:25:16,182
HEATER ON TONIGHT TOO.

1017
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:17,049
I AM NOT BRINGING A BABY HOME

1018
00:25:17,049 --> 00:25:19,852
FROM THE HOSPITAL IN A COLD CAR.

1019
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,954
MY DUE DATE IS TEN DAYS AWAY,

1020
00:25:21,954 --> 00:25:22,955
BUT EVERYONE THINKS I'M GOING

1021
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:23,823
EARLY.

1022
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:25,024
I'VE BEEN DRILLING CODY WITH

1023
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,225
OUR BIRTH PLAN, AND I HOPE

1024
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:27,660
IT'S SINKING IN.

1025
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,427
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WHEN

1026
00:25:28,427 --> 00:25:29,361
I TELL YOU THAT I'M IN LABOR?

1027
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,897
>> PROBABLY FREAK OUT.

1028
00:25:30,897 --> 00:25:32,498
>> [laughs]

1029
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:33,499
SO YOU'RE GONNA BE NICE

1030
00:25:33,499 --> 00:25:35,534
AND, LIKE, MASSAGE MY BACK

1031
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:37,036
AND RUB MY FEET.

1032
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:38,905
>> OCCASIONALLY, I GUESS.

1033
00:25:38,905 --> 00:25:39,939
CAN I GO WATCH MY FOOTBALL GAME

1034
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:40,607
NOW?

1035
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:41,273
>> YEAH.

1036
00:25:41,273 --> 00:25:42,642
>> THANK YOU.

1037
00:25:42,642 --> 00:25:43,910
>> CODY THINKS WE STILL HAVE

1038
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,645
TIME TO GET READY FOR THIS BABY,

1039
00:25:45,645 --> 00:25:47,647
BUT THE NEXT DAY, MY WATER BROKE

1040
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:48,915
AT SCHOOL, AND HE RUSHED ME

1041
00:25:48,915 --> 00:25:51,150
TO THE HOSPITAL.

1042
00:25:58,758 --> 00:25:59,491
>> ALL RIGHT.

1043
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:00,526
>> OKAY.

1044
00:26:00,526 --> 00:26:01,493
>> WE'RE READY FOR A BIRTHDAY

1045
00:26:01,493 --> 00:26:02,494
PARTY.

1046
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:03,195
>> CAN I HAVE MY PHONE

1047
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:06,532
SO I CAN CALL SOMEBODY?

1048
00:26:06,532 --> 00:26:08,000
I CALLED MY WHOLE FAMILY

1049
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,703
TO COME HELP ME CELEBRATE.

1050
00:26:10,703 --> 00:26:11,503
THEY JUST MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT

1051
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:12,705
AROUND A LITTLE WHILE.

1052
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:13,706
>> I THINK ALL OF MANSFIELD

1053
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:15,141
IS IN THE WAITING ROOM.

1054
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:15,975
>> YEAH.

1055
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:16,776
>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET

1056
00:26:16,776 --> 00:26:18,177
YOUR I.V. STARTED.

1057
00:26:18,177 --> 00:26:19,178
>> AH!

1058
00:26:19,178 --> 00:26:20,713
[whines]

1059
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:22,248
I'M SCARED.

1060
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:23,249
I HATE NEEDLES.

1061
00:26:23,249 --> 00:26:24,083
>> NOT GONNA BE AS BAD

1062
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:24,917
AS YOU THINK.

1063
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:25,584
>> OW!

1064
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:27,086
[gasps]

1065
00:26:27,086 --> 00:26:28,755
PEOPLE MIGHT THINK I'M A TOMBOY,

1066
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:29,922
BUT I DO NOT DEAL WELL

1067
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,157
WITH PAIN.

1068
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:32,191
I GOT AN EPIDURAL AT THE

1069
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:35,194
EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY.

1070
00:26:35,194 --> 00:26:36,963
COME SIT OVER HERE IN A CHAIR,

1071
00:26:36,963 --> 00:26:37,797
PLEASE.

1072
00:26:37,797 --> 00:26:38,965
I'VE SPENT SO MUCH TIME GETTING

1073
00:26:38,965 --> 00:26:40,800
CODY READY FOR THIS DAY,

1074
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,201
BUT NOW I'M NOT SO SURE

1075
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:44,136
I'M EVEN READY.

1076
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:55,547
>> OKAY, LET'S BRING--

1077
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:58,818
CAN YOU BRING THEM UP?

1078
00:26:58,818 --> 00:26:59,652
OH, YEAH, WE'RE READY.

1079
00:26:59,652 --> 00:27:00,920
YOU'RE A 10.

1080
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:01,754
>> WOW.

1081
00:27:01,754 --> 00:27:03,222
>> NOW IT'S ALL UP TO YOU.

1082
00:27:03,222 --> 00:27:04,456
>> THIS IS HURTING.

1083
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,458
MY LABOR IS PROGRESSING FAST,

1084
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,594
AND FOUR HOURS IN, I'M READY

1085
00:27:08,594 --> 00:27:09,696
TO START PUSHING.

1086
00:27:09,696 --> 00:27:10,730
>> A BIG BREATH, AND START

1087
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:11,898
GRABBING BEHIND OUR KNEES.

1088
00:27:11,898 --> 00:27:14,066
PUT YOUR CHIN ON YOUR CHEST.

1089
00:27:14,066 --> 00:27:15,067
FOCUS, CLOSE YOUR EYES.

1090
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:16,402
PUSH, PUSH, PUSH, PUSH, PUSH.

1091
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:18,404
PUSH DOWN, PUSH DOWN, PUSH DOWN.

1092
00:27:18,404 --> 00:27:19,238
THAT'S IT.

1093
00:27:19,238 --> 00:27:20,740
THAT'S THE PUSH RIGHT THERE.

1094
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:21,573
KEEP GOING, KEEP GOING,

1095
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:23,075
KEEP GOING.

1096
00:27:23,075 --> 00:27:24,143
ALL RIGHT.

1097
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:24,811
DO IT AGAIN.

1098
00:27:24,811 --> 00:27:26,312
DEEP BREATH, ONE MORE TIME.

1099
00:27:26,312 --> 00:27:28,280
PUSH AGAINST ALL THIS PRESSURE.

1100
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,115
>> GIVE ME THAT MASK BACK.

1101
00:27:29,115 --> 00:27:30,082
>> OKAY.

1102
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:31,918
OKAY, LET'S TAKE A DEEP BREATH.

1103
00:27:31,918 --> 00:27:33,886
LET'S BEAR DOWN, AND LET'S PUSH.

1104
00:27:33,886 --> 00:27:34,586
COME ON, PUSH!

1105
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:35,587
>> ONE, TWO...

1106
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:36,588
>> COME ON, GO, GO, GO,

1107
00:27:36,588 --> 00:27:37,589
GO, GO, GO, GO.

1108
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:40,292
>> FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT,

1109
00:27:40,292 --> 00:27:41,593
NINE, TEN.

1110
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,495
>> OKAY, QUICK, DO IT AGAIN.

1111
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:44,163
THERE YOU GO.

1112
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,097
LOOK HOW MUCH YOU'RE MOVING HIM.

1113
00:27:45,097 --> 00:27:45,765
GO.

1114
00:27:45,765 --> 00:27:47,433
>> ONE, TWO, THREE...

1115
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:49,936
>> COME ON, SWEETIE, PUSH.

1116
00:27:49,936 --> 00:27:50,937
YOU'RE GONNA DO IT.

1117
00:27:50,937 --> 00:27:52,438
>> EIGHT, NINE, TEN.

1118
00:27:52,438 --> 00:27:53,439
>> CAN ALMOST SEE HIS FOREHEAD.

1119
00:27:53,439 --> 00:27:54,640
COME ON, PUSH.

1120
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,743
>> ONE, TWO, THREE...

1121
00:27:56,743 --> 00:27:58,110

REAL GENTLE.

>> OH, MY.

1125
00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:01,714
HE'S A LONG GUY.

1126
00:28:01,714 --> 00:28:03,716
LOOK AT HIM!

1127
00:28:03,716 --> 00:28:06,052
>> OH, MY GOODNESS.

THERE YOU GO.

1132

RIGHT HERE, OKAY?

1137
00:28:18,264 --> 00:28:19,932
GO, BIG CUT.

1138

[cheering]

1139
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:23,502
LOOK AT THESE.

1140
00:28:23,502 --> 00:28:27,740
>> OH!

1143
00:28:31,277 --> 00:28:32,278
SEE, HE'S GOT A LOT MORE HAIR

1144
00:28:32,278 --> 00:28:33,445
THAN WE THOUGHT HE DID.

1145
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:34,781
>> YEAH!

1146

[Brody cries]

1147
00:28:35,982 --> 00:28:36,883
>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S LET HIM

1148
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:37,549
GET CLEANED UP.

1149
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:38,384
>> LET ME TAKE HIM OVER THERE.

1150
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,286
I'LL BRING HIM BACK.

>> HI!

1155
00:28:59,772 --> 00:29:01,107
>> EVERYONE WAS SO EXCITED

1156
00:29:01,107 --> 00:29:03,275
TO SEE BRODY, BUT I WAS JUST

1157
00:29:03,275 --> 00:29:05,978
EXHAUSTED.

1158
00:29:05,978 --> 00:29:07,646
>> YOU READY TO BREAST-FEED?

1159
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:08,414
>> YEAH.

1160
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:09,415
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

1161
00:29:09,415 --> 00:29:10,516
>> YOU WANT TO BREAST-FEED

1162
00:29:10,516 --> 00:29:11,750
15 MINUTES ON EACH SIDE,

1163
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,751
AND ONCE HE LATCHES ON,

1164
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:13,619
MAKE SURE HE'S NOT JUST ON

1165
00:29:13,619 --> 00:29:14,420
YOUR NIPPLE.

1166
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,923
HE NEEDS TO BE ON REAL GOOD,

1167
00:29:16,923 --> 00:29:18,090
OKAY?

1168
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,492
'CAUSE IT HURTS REAL BAD.

1169
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:26,232
>> IT'S FINALLY TIME TO BRING

1170
00:29:26,232 --> 00:29:27,566
BRODY HOME.

1171
00:29:27,566 --> 00:29:28,600
OH, HE HAS TO CHANGE CLOTHES.

1172
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,936
HE CAN'T GO HOME IN THAT.

1173
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:30,937
>> OKAY.

1174
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:33,539
>> WE'RE GONNA CHANGE HIM AGAIN.

1175
00:29:35,908 --> 00:29:38,811
OKAY.

1176
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:39,578
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

1177
00:29:39,578 --> 00:29:44,316
>> THANK YOU.

1178

GOODNESS, GRACIOUS.

1181
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:51,390
I'M SORRY THAT I'M NOT IMPORTANT

1182
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,059
ANYMORE.

1183
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:54,393
>> [laughs]

1184
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:58,230
COME HERE, CHILD.

1185
00:29:58,230 --> 00:29:59,565
>> WANT TO GO GIVE HIM A BATH?

1186
00:29:59,565 --> 00:30:01,033
HIS FIRST BATH?

1187
00:30:01,033 --> 00:30:02,701
>> HE DON'T NEED A BATH.

1188
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:04,036
HE'S SLEEPIN'.

1189
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:06,138
>> OH, HE SNOOZED THE WHOLE WAY

1190
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,306
HERE.

1191
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:08,307
>> YOU'RE GONNA WAKE HIM UP,

1192
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:09,141
AND HE'S GONNA BE COLD.

1193
00:30:09,141 --> 00:30:10,977
>> HE WILL BE FINE.

1194
00:30:10,977 --> 00:30:11,978
>> AND THEN HE'S GONNA CRY.

1195
00:30:11,978 --> 00:30:12,979
>> IT'S OKAY IF HE'S COLD

1196
00:30:12,979 --> 00:30:14,380
FOR A FEW MINUTES.

1197
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:16,048
YOU'RE ABOUT TO BE REALLY MAD,

1198
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:17,049
DUDE.

1199
00:30:17,049 --> 00:30:18,650
I'M NERVOUS ABOUT GIVING BRODY

1200
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,152
HIS FIRST BATH, BUT I WANT TO

1201
00:30:20,152 --> 00:30:21,653
KNOW WE'RE ABLE TO DO IT.

1202
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,388
WHAT'S THE RULE ONE

1203
00:30:22,388 --> 00:30:23,990
WHEN YOU GIVE A BABY A BATH?

1204
00:30:23,990 --> 00:30:25,324
>> YOU ONLY WASH ONE PART

1205
00:30:25,324 --> 00:30:26,125
AT A TIME.

1206
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:27,626
>> NO.

1207
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:28,995
>> YOU DAB HIM?

1208
00:30:28,995 --> 00:30:31,397
>> WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

1209
00:30:31,397 --> 00:30:32,564
WHAT DO YOU START WITH?

1210
00:30:32,564 --> 00:30:33,399
>> HIS HEAD.

1211
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:36,535
>> THE CLEANEST PART IS FIRST.

1212
00:30:36,535 --> 00:30:37,436
>> WELL, WHERE'S HIS CLEANEST

1213
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:38,204
PART?

1214
00:30:38,204 --> 00:30:39,238
>> WILL YOU TWO QUIT ARGUING AND

1215
00:30:39,238 --> 00:30:41,307
JUST CLEAN THE FRICKIN' BABY?

1216
00:30:41,307 --> 00:30:42,808
>> CODY WAS RIGHT.

1217
00:30:42,808 --> 00:30:45,311
BRODY DOESN'T LIKE THIS ONE BIT.

1218
00:30:45,311 --> 00:30:47,146
I DECIDED THE BATH COULD WAIT.

1219
00:30:47,146 --> 00:30:48,147
OKAY, PUT HIS CLOTHES BACK

1220
00:30:48,147 --> 00:30:49,015
ON HIM.

1221
00:30:49,015 --> 00:30:50,016
>> I'M STARTING TO FIGURE OUT--

1222
00:30:50,016 --> 00:30:51,918
>> YOU HAVE TO HURRY.

1223
00:30:51,918 --> 00:30:55,487
HE HATES THIS PART.

1224
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:58,490
HURRY, BEFORE HE WAKES UP MOM.

1225
00:30:58,490 --> 00:30:59,358
>> WHAT KIND OF CRY IS THAT?

1226
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:00,026
COME ON.

1227
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:01,427
>> HURRY UP!

1228
00:31:01,427 --> 00:31:02,261
>> SHUT YOUR PIEHOLE.

1229
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:04,096
>> WHAT IS TAKING YOU SO LONG?

1230
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:05,464
>> WELL, THEN YOU PUT IT ON.

1231
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:06,465
>> IT AIN'T THAT FRICKIN' HARD

1232
00:31:06,465 --> 00:31:08,134
TO PUT ON GLOVES.

1233
00:31:08,134 --> 00:31:10,302
>> [crying]

1234
00:31:10,302 --> 00:31:11,303
>> HURRY UP!

1235
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:12,138
PUT IT ON!

1236
00:31:12,138 --> 00:31:12,972
>> HAVE TO GET FIVE FINGERS

1237
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:15,407
IN THERE.

1238
00:31:15,407 --> 00:31:16,742
[Brody crying]

1239
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:18,577
BRODY STILL HATES TAKING BATHS,

1240
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:19,912
BUT WITH MY MOM'S HELP,

1241
00:31:19,912 --> 00:31:20,913
I'M STARTING TO GET THE HANG

1242
00:31:20,913 --> 00:31:21,914
OF IT.

1243
00:31:21,914 --> 00:31:24,917
>> BRODY, OH.

1244
00:31:24,917 --> 00:31:26,518
>> MY FAMILY'S BEEN VERY EXCITED

1245
00:31:26,518 --> 00:31:27,653
TO HAVE A BABY IN THE HOUSE.

1246
00:31:27,653 --> 00:31:28,487
>> WHAT'S THE MATTER WITH

1247
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:30,089
THE LITTLE BUDDY?

1248
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:31,257
>> BUT MY MOM HAS LITTLE

1249
00:31:31,257 --> 00:31:32,424
TOLERANCE FOR US GETTING BEHIND

1250
00:31:32,424 --> 00:31:34,093
ON OUR CHORES, WHICH IS HOW

1251
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:35,261
WE PAY OUR RENT.

1252
00:31:35,261 --> 00:31:36,262
>> IS THAT A NASTY, CRUSTY

1253

BREAST PAD WITH THE BABY'S

1254
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:38,764
PACIFIER SITTING ON IT?

1255
00:31:38,764 --> 00:31:40,266
>> NO, IT'S MINE THAT I HAVE IN

1256
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:41,267
RIGHT NOW.

1257
00:31:41,267 --> 00:31:42,969
>> CRUSTY BREAST PADS.

1258
00:31:42,969 --> 00:31:44,103
>> IF YOU PICK THEM UP ON

1259
00:31:44,103 --> 00:31:45,104
THE PURPLE SIDE---

1260
00:31:45,104 --> 00:31:46,605
>> I SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PICK UP

1261
00:31:46,605 --> 00:31:48,975
A BREAST PAD EVER.

1262
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,249
>> SINCE BRODY WAS BORN,

1263
00:31:57,249 --> 00:31:58,417
WE'VE HAD A PRETTY STEADY

1264
00:31:58,417 --> 00:31:59,685
ROUTINE.

1265
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:01,020
CODY GOES TO WORK IN THE MORNING

1266
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,688
WHILE I TAKE CARE OF BRODY

1267
00:32:02,688 --> 00:32:04,056
AND TRY TO STAY ON TOP

1268
00:32:04,056 --> 00:32:05,391
OF OUR CHORES, BUT ALL OF

1269
00:32:05,391 --> 00:32:07,726
THAT'S ABOUT TO CHANGE.

1270
00:32:07,726 --> 00:32:09,061
WE'RE GONNA GO OVER EVERYTHING

1271
00:32:09,061 --> 00:32:10,229
THAT YOU HAVE TO DO TOMORROW.

1272
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:11,563
TOMORROW IS MY FIRST DAY

1273
00:32:11,563 --> 00:32:13,232
BACK AT SCHOOL, AND I'M REALLY

1274
00:32:13,232 --> 00:32:15,101
NERVOUS ABOUT LEAVING BRODY.

1275
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:16,102
BREAST MILK'S UP THERE.

1276
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:17,636
FORMULA'S ON THE BOTTOM.

1277
00:32:17,636 --> 00:32:19,738
IF YOU'VE ALREADY FED HIM,

1278
00:32:19,738 --> 00:32:21,373
THEN BURP HIM.

1279
00:32:21,373 --> 00:32:22,674
CHANGE HIS DIAPER.

1280
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:23,442
HAVE YOU SEEN THE NUMBERS

1281
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:24,110
ON THE FRIDGE?

1282
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,011
>> DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEY WERE

1283
00:32:25,011 --> 00:32:25,611
AT FIRST.

1284
00:32:25,611 --> 00:32:27,013
>> WHO ARE YOU GONNA CALL FIRST?

1285
00:32:27,013 --> 00:32:29,315
>> I THINK YOUR MOM IS FIRST.

1286
00:32:29,315 --> 00:32:30,649
>> YOU'RE GONNA CALL ME FIRST

1287
00:32:30,649 --> 00:32:33,652
AND THEN MY SCHOOL.

1288
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:36,588
[alarm buzzing]

1289
00:32:39,658 --> 00:32:40,826
THIS WILL BE THE LONGEST I'VE

1290
00:32:40,826 --> 00:32:42,161
BEEN AWAY FROM BRODY SINCE

1291
00:32:42,161 --> 00:32:43,895
THE DAY HE WAS BORN.

1292
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:45,931
LET ME SEE HIM.

1293
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:48,367
[crying] HEY, BUDDY.

1294
00:32:48,367 --> 00:32:50,069
I'M SAD.

1295
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:51,537
[sniffles]

1296
00:32:51,537 --> 00:32:53,539
I'M GONNA MISS HIM.

1297
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:55,374
>> BABY, YOU HAVE TO LEAVE.

1298
00:32:55,374 --> 00:32:57,076
>> I KNOW, BUT I DON'T WANT TO.

1299
00:32:57,076 --> 00:32:58,377
>> I KNOW YOU DON'T.

1300
00:32:58,377 --> 00:32:59,545
THE LONGER YOU STAY HERE,

1301
00:32:59,545 --> 00:33:01,180
THE HARDER IT'S GOING TO BE.

1302
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:02,181
>> I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS

1303
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:03,349
FOR ME TO FINISH MY JUNIOR

1304
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:04,316
YEAR, BUT I NEVER REALIZED

1305
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:05,251
HOW HARD IT WOULD BE TO LEAVE

1306
00:33:05,251 --> 00:33:07,186
MY BABY.

1307
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:17,563
[Brody fussing]

1308
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:18,564
>> CODY AND I HAVE BEEN ON

1309
00:33:18,564 --> 00:33:19,731
A TIGHT SCHEDULE.

1310
00:33:19,731 --> 00:33:21,233
HE MINDS BRODY DURING THE DAY

1311
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:22,734
WHILE I'M AT SCHOOL, AND WHEN

1312
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:24,636
I GET HOME, HE TAKES OFF

1313
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:26,205
AND HEADS TO WORK.

1314
00:33:26,205 --> 00:33:27,539
THEN THE NEXT DAY, WE DO IT

1315
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:28,974
ALL OVER AGAIN.

1316
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:30,176
THERE'S NEVER ANY TIME FOR US

1317
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:31,110
TO BE A COUPLE.

1318
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:32,111
WE USED TO SPEND TIME TOGETHER

1319
00:33:32,111 --> 00:33:33,645
AT THE TRACK, BUT WE HAD TO GIVE

1320
00:33:33,645 --> 00:33:34,813
THAT UP TOO.

1321
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:35,981
BUT TODAY HE'S CALLED IN LATE

1322
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:37,149
TO WORK SO HE CAN BRING ME

1323
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:38,984
TO MY DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT.

1324
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:39,818
WE'LL TAKE WHATEVER TIME

1325
00:33:39,818 --> 00:33:41,153
TOGETHER WE CAN GET.

1326
00:33:41,153 --> 00:33:41,987
HI.

1327
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:42,654
>> HEY!

1328
00:33:42,654 --> 00:33:43,989
OH, MY GOSH.

1329
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:45,991
WELL, ARE YOU GETTING ANY SLEEP?

1330
00:33:45,991 --> 00:33:46,992
>> YEAH, HE'S SLEPT FROM

1331
00:33:46,992 --> 00:33:49,195
11:00 TO 6:00 EVERY NIGHT.

1332
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:49,861
>> REALLY?

1333
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:50,529
>> MM-HMM.

1334
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:51,197
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

1335
00:33:51,197 --> 00:33:51,863
>> I KNOW.

1336
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:52,564
>> IT'S HARD WORK.

1337
00:33:52,564 --> 00:33:53,199
>> YEAH.

1338
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:54,200
>> HAVE WE HAD SEX?

1339
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:55,101
>> NOPE.

1340
00:33:55,101 --> 00:33:55,767
>> NOPE.

1341
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:56,435
>> ABSOLUTELY NONE?

1342
00:33:56,435 --> 00:33:57,103
>> NOPE, NO NOTHING.

1343
00:33:57,103 --> 00:33:58,003
>> OKAY, 'CAUSE WE KNOW WE CAN

1344
00:33:58,003 --> 00:33:59,071
GET PREGNANT.

1345
00:33:59,071 --> 00:34:01,039
>> YEP, NOT HAPPENING.

1346
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,040
>> WHAT DO Y'ALL THINK YOU CAN

1347
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,609
REMEMBER FOR BIRTH CONTROL?

1348
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:04,443
>> MIRENA.

1349
00:34:04,443 --> 00:34:05,677
>> MIRENA, I.U.D.s.

1350
00:34:05,677 --> 00:34:06,545
I THINK IT'S GOOD FOR FIVE

1351
00:34:06,545 --> 00:34:07,513
YEARS.

1352
00:34:07,513 --> 00:34:08,680
WITH THE I.U.D., THE GOOD THING

1353
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,915
ABOUT IT, IT DOESN'T HAVE

1354
00:34:09,915 --> 00:34:11,517
A LOT OF HORMONE THAT GOES INTO

1355
00:34:11,517 --> 00:34:12,518
YOUR SYSTEM, SO IT SHOULDN'T

1356
00:34:12,518 --> 00:34:13,685
AFFECT YOUR BREAST-FEEDING.

1357
00:34:13,685 --> 00:34:14,520
>> OKAY.

1358
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:15,521
>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S HAVE YOU

1359
00:34:15,521 --> 00:34:16,422
LIE BACK.

1360
00:34:16,422 --> 00:34:17,823
I'LL PULL THIS UP.

1361
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:18,924
ALL RIGHT.

1362
00:34:18,924 --> 00:34:21,093
>> THIS IS AWKWARD.

1363
00:34:21,093 --> 00:34:21,760
>> SO YOU MIGHT FEEL

1364
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,961
A LITTLE PINCH.

1365
00:34:22,961 --> 00:34:23,829
>> OW, THAT HURTS.

1366
00:34:23,829 --> 00:34:25,364
>> I'M SORRY.

1367
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:26,732
ALL DONE.

1368
00:34:26,732 --> 00:34:27,399
>> REALLY?

1369
00:34:27,399 --> 00:34:28,634
>> YEAH, I WANT YOU TO WAIT A

1370
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:32,704
WEEK BEFORE YOU HAVE SEX, OKAY?

1371
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:33,805
ANY QUESTIONS?

1372
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:34,873
>> UH-UH.

1373
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:35,874
>> HOW LONG ARE WE WAITING?

1374
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:36,542
>> both: A WEEK.

1375
00:34:36,542 --> 00:34:38,210
>> ALL RIGHT.

1376
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,378
>> CODY AND I HAVEN'T SAVED

1377
00:34:39,378 --> 00:34:41,213
NEARLY ENOUGH TO BUY OUR PREFAB

1378
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:42,914
BARN YET, BUT IT DOESN'T HURT

1379
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:43,915
TO STOP AND TAKE A LOOK

1380
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:46,252
EVERY ONCE IN A WHILE.

1381
00:34:46,252 --> 00:34:48,554
>> SAYS CLOSED.

1382
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:50,189
LET'S LOOK AROUND FIRST.

1383
00:34:50,189 --> 00:34:51,523
>> OKAY.

1384
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:53,492
THAT ONE CAN BE BRODY'S ROOM.

1385
00:34:53,492 --> 00:34:54,326
>> HELL, HE GETS A BIGGER ROOM

1386
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:55,060
THAN WE GOT.

1387
00:34:55,060 --> 00:34:57,763
>> WE WANT OUR OWN HOME SO BAD.

1388
00:34:57,763 --> 00:34:58,664
BUT WE'RE NEVER GONNA BE ABLE

1389
00:34:58,664 --> 00:35:00,031
TO AFFORD IT IF WE DON'T FIGURE

1390
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:01,032
OUT WHERE ALL OF OUR MONEY

1391
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:01,767
IS GOING.

1392
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:04,770
SO AS OF NOW, WE AREN'T PUTTING

1393
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,772
ANYTHING ASIDE FOR PAYING BACK

1394
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:09,975
MOM AND DAD OR THE HOUSE

1395
00:35:09,975 --> 00:35:10,809
OR ANYTHING.

1396
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:12,511
SO ARE WE GONNA CHANGE THAT NOW

1397
00:35:12,511 --> 00:35:13,179
OR...

1398
00:35:13,179 --> 00:35:14,346
>> UH, YEAH.

1399
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:15,347
>> ARE WE GONNA KEEP DOING IT

1400
00:35:15,347 --> 00:35:16,815
TO SAVE UP FOR THE HOUSE?

1401
00:35:16,815 --> 00:35:17,783
>> PRETTY MUCH THE ONLY THING

1402
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:19,117
WE SPEND WEEKLY IS JUST

1403
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,452
PROBABLY GAS.

1404
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,320
>> CODY.

1405
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:22,221
YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO PULL OUT

1406
00:35:22,221 --> 00:35:23,322
THE BANK STATEMENT, BECAUSE WE

1407
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:25,023
HAVE THEM IN THE KITCHEN.

1408
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:27,159
GIVE ME A CALCULATOR.

1409
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:29,161
SMILEY'S, WAS THAT NEEDED?

1410
00:35:29,161 --> 00:35:30,296
>> I DIDN'T BUY NEW CLOTHES

1411
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:31,129
FROM SMILEY'S.

1412
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,464
>> NOW WE'RE AT $121,

1413
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:33,932
AND THAT'S JUST ONE PAPER.

1414
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:34,933
>> WHAT DID YOU SPEND $35

1415
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:36,802
AT WALMART FOR?

1416
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:38,404
>> I DON'T GO TO WALMART, CODY.

1417
00:35:38,404 --> 00:35:40,472
>> I DON'T EITHER.

1418
00:35:40,472 --> 00:35:43,475
I DIDN'T SPEND ALL THAT.

1419
00:35:43,475 --> 00:35:44,643
>> CODY AND I DON'T HAVE MUCH

1420
00:35:44,643 --> 00:35:46,312
TIME TOGETHER, AND EVEN THOUGH,

1421
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:48,146
WE CAN'T AFFORD IT, WE DECIDED

1422
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:50,482
TO MAKE SOME TIME FOR OURSELVES.

1423
00:35:50,482 --> 00:35:52,884
>> [sighs]

1424
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,052
>> I'M SO TIRED.

>> YEAH, ME TOO.

1426
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:57,022
>> IT'S RIDICULOUS.

1427
00:35:57,022 --> 00:36:00,692
[Brody fussing]

1428
00:36:00,692 --> 00:36:02,628

1431
00:36:10,101 --> 00:36:12,070
HERE, HAND HIM TO ME.

[Brody crying]

1433
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:15,474
HEY, BUDDY.

1434
00:36:19,545 --> 00:36:21,213
I WAS EXCITED ABOUT COMING OUT

1435
00:36:21,213 --> 00:36:23,215
TONIGHT.

1436
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:24,883
NOW I'M TIRED, AND I FEEL SICK,

1437
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:26,752
AND I WANT TO GO HOME AND GO

1438
00:36:26,752 --> 00:36:29,054
TO BED AFTER THIS.

1439
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:02,020
>> I USED TO GO OVER TO NIKKI'S

1440

1441
00:37:03,522 --> 00:37:05,123
THERE'S NO TIME FOR HANGING.

1442
00:37:05,123 --> 00:37:06,292
I NEED HER TO WATCH BRODY

1443
00:37:06,292 --> 00:37:07,459
SO I CAN CATCH UP A LITTLE

1444
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:08,694
ON MY STUDYING.

1445
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:10,028
CODY'S PRETTY EXCITED.

IN SIX WEEKS.

1450
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:17,035
IT'S, LIKE, NO.

1451
00:37:17,035 --> 00:37:18,370
HE IS NOT HOME LONG ENOUGH

1452
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,371
TO DO ANYTHING.

1453
00:37:19,371 --> 00:37:20,639
I PROMISE.

1454

AND AS SOON AS I GET BACK,

1459
00:37:29,848 --> 00:37:31,182
IT FEELS LIKE I'M RUNNING IN

1460
00:37:31,182 --> 00:37:32,518
PLACE BETWEEN DOING HOMEWORK

1461
00:37:32,518 --> 00:37:34,853
AND CARING FOR BRODY.

1462
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:36,021
I NEVER REALLY GET CAUGHT UP

WHICH MY MOM EXPECTS US TO DO

1465
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:41,159
SINCE WE DON'T PAY RENT.

1466

1467
00:37:43,329 --> 00:37:45,497
TO BE CLEANED BEFORE FRIDAY

1468
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:47,833
FOR THE WEEKEND, RIGHT?

1469
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:49,335
AND IT'S NOT HAPPENING.

1470

"I KNOW," BUT "I KNOW"

1474
00:37:54,406 --> 00:37:55,907

WHERE I'M GONNA START REALLY

1480
00:38:03,181 --> 00:38:06,084

BE A LITTLE BIT EASIER,

1487
00:38:13,792 --> 00:38:16,294
BUT I THINK ONCE REALITY SET IN,

1488
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:18,797
IT'S, LIKE, WHOA.

1489
00:38:18,797 --> 00:38:19,798
IT'S, LIKE, NOT AS EASY

1490
00:38:19,798 --> 00:38:21,367
AS YOU THINK IT IS.

1491
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:22,534
>> WE'RE ALL COMING TOGETHER

1492
00:38:22,534 --> 00:38:23,535
SO THAT YOU CAN LEARN HOW TO BE

1493
00:38:23,535 --> 00:38:25,871
A WIFE AND A MOM AND SO THAT YOU

1494
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:27,105
CAN LEARN HOW TO BE A HUSBAND

1495
00:38:27,105 --> 00:38:28,106
AND A DAD.

1496
00:38:28,106 --> 00:38:29,107
WE'RE TRYING TO GIVE YOU GUYS

1497
00:38:29,107 --> 00:38:30,275
THE OPPORTUNITY TO FINISH

1498
00:38:30,275 --> 00:38:32,978
SCHOOL, HAVE SOME MONEY SAVED UP

1499
00:38:32,978 --> 00:38:35,481
TO FALL BACK ON TO WHERE WHEN

1500
00:38:35,481 --> 00:38:38,316
YOU DO MOVE OUT, YOU CAN DO IT

1501
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,785
ON YOUR OWN.

1502
00:38:39,785 --> 00:38:41,252
IS THIS TOO MUCH?

1503
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:42,153
IS THIS TOO MUCH TO DO?

1504
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:43,489
>> NO, IT'S NOT.

1505
00:38:43,489 --> 00:38:44,823
>> BROOKE, IF IT'S TOO MUCH,

1506
00:38:44,823 --> 00:38:45,491
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME.

1507
00:38:45,491 --> 00:38:46,458
>> I'M TELLING YOU IT'S NOT

1508
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:46,992
TOO MUCH.

1509
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:47,993
MY MOM WAS ABLE TO MANAGE

1510
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:49,661
WITH ME WHEN SHE WAS A TEENAGER.

1511
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:51,162
I'M NOT GONNA LET HER DOWN

1512
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,899
BY MAKING HER RAISE MY BABY.

1513
00:38:53,899 --> 00:38:55,401
>> * IF IT'S THE TRUTH *

1514
00:38:55,401 --> 00:38:58,103
* THAT SETS YOU FREE *

1515
00:38:58,103 --> 00:38:59,605
>> BEFORE I GOT PREGNANT,

1516
00:38:59,605 --> 00:39:01,106
EVERY AFTERNOON I WOULD LEAVE

1517
00:39:01,106 --> 00:39:03,041
SCHOOL AND GO TO CODY'S HOUSE

1518
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:04,876
AND LAUGH AND HAVE A GOOD TIME,

1519
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:07,212
BUT NOW AFTER SCHOOL, I PICK UP

1520
00:39:07,212 --> 00:39:09,881
BRODY, AND I STAY AT HOME

1521
00:39:09,881 --> 00:39:11,383
AND WATCH TV BY MYSELF

1522
00:39:11,383 --> 00:39:12,551
BECAUSE CODY'S AT WORK.

1523
00:39:12,551 --> 00:39:15,353
SO CODY'S AMAZING.

1524
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,188
I MEAN, EVER SINCE DAY ONE

1525
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,356
WHEN I FOUND OUT I WAS PREGNANT,

1526
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:19,491
HE'S STEPPED UP, AND HE'S

1527
00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:21,026
BEEN A MAN.

1528
00:39:21,026 --> 00:39:22,193
>> THE MAGIC MEDICINE.

1529
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,029
WHOO!

1530
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:25,196
>> I COULDN'T ASK FOR ANYTHING

1531
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,633
BETTER, BUT NOW HE HAS TO WORK

1532
00:39:27,633 --> 00:39:29,468
MORE, AND WE DON'T GET TO SPEND

1533
00:39:29,468 --> 00:39:30,469
AS MUCH TIME TOGETHER

1534
00:39:30,469 --> 00:39:34,640
AS WE USED TO, AND WE MISS THAT.

1535
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:36,875
JESUS.

1536
00:39:36,875 --> 00:39:38,710
IN MY FAMILY, WE'RE ALL ABOUT

1537
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:40,546
RACING AND BEING TOGETHER,

1538
00:39:40,546 --> 00:39:42,614
BUT UNTIL WE HAVE ALL OF OUR

1539
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:43,782
STUFF TOGETHER, THERE'S NO WAY

1540
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:45,651
THAT I CAN RACE AND HE CAN RACE

1541
00:39:45,651 --> 00:39:46,985
AT THE SAME TIME, 'CAUSE WE JUST

1542
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:50,255
CAN'T AFFORD IT.

1543
00:39:50,255 --> 00:39:51,256
I HATE IT WHEN I ARGUE WITH

1544
00:39:51,256 --> 00:39:54,693
MY MOM.

1545
00:39:54,693 --> 00:39:55,861
IT FEELS LIKE I'M OVERWHELMED

1546
00:39:55,861 --> 00:39:57,028
WITH ALL THE CLEANING THAT

1547
00:39:57,028 --> 00:39:58,530
I HAVE TO DO, AND IT'S

1548
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:01,299
EXHAUSTING HAVING TO BE A MOM

1549
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:03,635
AND A WIFE AND A DAUGHTER

1550
00:40:03,635 --> 00:40:05,303
ALL AT THE SAME TIME.

1551
00:40:05,303 --> 00:40:08,640
IT'S OVERWHELMING.

1552
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:09,975
>> I NEVER REALIZED THAT BRODY

1553
00:40:09,975 --> 00:40:11,009
COULD TAKE UP SO MUCH SPACE

1554
00:40:11,009 --> 00:40:12,678
FOR AS LITTLE AS HE IS.

1555
00:40:12,678 --> 00:40:13,912
>> I KNOW.

1556
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,080
HE NEEDS A LOT OF STUFF,

1557
00:40:15,080 --> 00:40:16,748
AND IT SUCKS.

1558
00:40:16,748 --> 00:40:18,750
I JUST--I WANT ME AND CODY

1559
00:40:18,750 --> 00:40:21,520
TO HAVE FAMILY TIME ALONE

1560
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,353
WITH BRODY.

1561
00:40:22,353 --> 00:40:24,856
CODY, I DIDN'T MEAN THAT WAY!

1562
00:40:24,856 --> 00:40:25,691
>> WHOO!

1563
00:40:25,691 --> 00:40:26,825
>> CODY RYAN!

1564
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:28,159
I DOUBT THAT THAT'S GONNA BE

1565
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:31,162
ABLE TO HAPPEN UNTIL WE MOVE OUT

1566
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,831
AND HAVE OUR OWN PLACE.

1567
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:34,332
IT JUST SUCKS THAT WE HAD

1568
00:40:34,332 --> 00:40:36,868
TO GROW UP AS FAST AS WE DID.

1569
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:39,538
BUT BRODY'S AMAZING, AND I

1570
00:40:39,538 --> 00:40:41,807
WOULDN'T CHANGE ANYTHING.
