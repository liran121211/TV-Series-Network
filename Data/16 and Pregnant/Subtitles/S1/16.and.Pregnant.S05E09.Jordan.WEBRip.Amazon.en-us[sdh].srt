1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:04,500
>> [laughs]

2
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:05,500
I'M JORDAN.

3
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:07,067
I'M FROM BALTIMORE, MARYLAND.

4
00:00:07,067 --> 00:00:08,200
I WAS ALWAYS THE POPULAR GIRL

5
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:08,867
AT SCHOOL,

6
00:00:08,867 --> 00:00:09,967
AND NEVER MISSED A PARTY.

7
00:00:09,967 --> 00:00:11,300
REMEMBER HOW TAN I GOT?

8
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,467
>> YOU GOT REALLY TAN.

9
00:00:12,467 --> 00:00:14,133
>> WE DANCE.

10
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:15,300
>> WHEN I MET MY BOYFRIEND DEREK

11
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:16,700
OVER A YEAR AGO ON TWITTER,

12
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,933
WE GOT SERIOUS REALLY QUICKLY.

13
00:00:18,933 --> 00:00:20,500
WE SPEND ALL OUR TIME TOGETHER.

14
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:21,433
>> I LOVE YOU, BUG.

15
00:00:21,433 --> 00:00:24,167
>> I LOVE YOU.

16
00:00:24,167 --> 00:00:25,700
DEREK GOT A COLLEGE SCHOLARSHIP,

17
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,033
AND MY DAD AND STEPMOM EVEN LET

18
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:28,400
HIM MOVE IN WITH US BECAUSE HE

19
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,733
DIDN'T HAVE A PLACE TO STAY.

20
00:00:30,733 --> 00:00:31,733
I JUST GRADUATED FROM HIGH

21
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:33,267
SCHOOL, AND ALWAYS DREAMED OF

22
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:34,833
JOINING THE ARMY.

23
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:36,200
BUT NOW ALL OF OUR PLANS ARE

24
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:36,967
GONNA CHANGE,

25
00:00:36,967 --> 00:00:39,000
BECAUSE I'M PREGNANT.

26
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,033
DEREK AND I ARE HAVING A

27
00:00:46,033 --> 00:00:47,567
DAUGHTER, AND WE DECIDED TO NAME

28
00:00:47,567 --> 00:00:49,567
HER GENEVIEVE, EVIE FOR SHORT.

29
00:00:49,567 --> 00:00:51,000
SHE'LL BE HERE IN SEVEN WEEKS,

30
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,833
AND WE HAVE A LOT TO FIGURE OUT.

31
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:54,767
AFTER I FOUND OUT I WAS

32
00:00:54,767 --> 00:00:56,167
PREGNANT, DEREK DROPPED OUT OF

33
00:00:56,167 --> 00:00:57,700
COLLEGE AND STARTED WORKING.

34
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:00,133
BUT THEN HE LOST HIS JOB.

35
00:01:00,133 --> 00:01:01,067
MY PARENTS GOT MAD AND KICKED

36
00:01:01,067 --> 00:01:02,867
HIM OUT, AND I WENT WITH HIM.

37
00:01:02,867 --> 00:01:04,067
I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO THEM SINCE.

38
00:01:04,067 --> 00:01:06,067
>> THIS IS [bleep].

39
00:01:09,267 --> 00:01:10,267
>> FOR THE PAST THREE WEEKS,

40
00:01:10,267 --> 00:01:12,167
WE'VE BEEN BROKE AND HOMELESS.

41
00:01:12,167 --> 00:01:13,667
DEREK HASN'T GOTTEN ANOTHER JOB

42
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:14,800
YET.

43
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:15,733
HEY, I'VE BEEN WONDERING IF I

44
00:01:15,733 --> 00:01:16,833
COULD STAY WITH YOU GUYS

45
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:17,800
JUST FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

46
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,967
I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANYWHERE

47
00:01:18,967 --> 00:01:20,133
TO STAY RIGHT NOW.

48
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:20,967
WE'VE BEEN COUCH SURFING

49
00:01:20,967 --> 00:01:22,067
WITH FRIENDS.

50
00:01:22,067 --> 00:01:23,367
ALL WE HAVE IS EACH OTHER

51
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:24,400
AND OUR BEAT-UP OLD MINIVAN

52
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,733
THAT WE CALL BERTHA.

53
00:01:25,733 --> 00:01:27,600
I HATE LIVING OUT OF THIS CAR.

54
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,767
RIGHT NOW WE'RE STAYING WITH

55
00:01:28,767 --> 00:01:29,767
DEREK'S FRIEND PATRICK,

56
00:01:29,767 --> 00:01:31,067
BUT WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

57
00:01:31,067 --> 00:01:32,167
A BETTER OPTION.

58
00:01:32,167 --> 00:01:33,100
>> AWAKE?

59
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:34,433
>> YES, I'M AWAKE.

60
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:35,733
>> IS SHE AWAKE IN THERE?

61
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:36,433
>> YEAH.

62
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:37,333
SHE'S HUNGRY.

63
00:01:37,333 --> 00:01:39,067
[groans]

64
00:01:39,067 --> 00:01:41,067
THERE'S NOTHING IN THERE.

65
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:43,333
>> UM...

66
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:44,533
>> NO.

67
00:01:44,533 --> 00:01:45,233
>> THERE'S BANANAS.

68
00:01:45,233 --> 00:01:46,367
>> OH, YEAH.

69
00:01:46,367 --> 00:01:48,367
I GUESS I'LL EAT A BANANA.

70
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:55,200
YOU KNOW, WE CAN PROBABLY ONLY

71
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,233
STAY HERE A COUPLE MORE NIGHTS,

72
00:01:56,233 --> 00:01:57,167
'CAUSE WE'VE BEEN HERE FOR,

73
00:01:57,167 --> 00:01:59,200
WHAT, A BUNCH ALREADY?

74
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,367
>> I HATE HAVING ALL MY STUFF

75
00:02:00,367 --> 00:02:01,833
IN MY TRASH BAGS.

76
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:03,067
>> IT'S NOT WORKING.

77
00:02:03,067 --> 00:02:04,833
WE ARE BASICALLY HOMELESS.

78
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,933
I'M FURIOUS ABOUT WHEN MY DAD

79
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:08,233
KICKED US OUT.

80
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:09,067
YOUR JOB WAS SEASONAL,

81
00:02:09,067 --> 00:02:10,433
AND YOU TOLD HIM THAT.

82
00:02:10,433 --> 00:02:11,767
>> BUT HE ALWAYS OVERREACTS...

83
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:12,433
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

84
00:02:12,433 --> 00:02:13,400
>> SO IT'S NOT LIKE IT WASN'T

85
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,067
EXPECTED.

86
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,067
>> I'M REALLY MAD ABOUT

87
00:02:15,067 --> 00:02:16,100
THE WHOLE SITUATION.

88
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:17,767
OUR LIVES WOULD BE SO DIFFERENT

89
00:02:17,767 --> 00:02:19,500
IF I DIDN'T GET PREGNANT.

90
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,833
MAYBE WE SHOULD'VE BEEN

91
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,533
A LOT MORE CAREFUL.

92
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:24,533
>> THAT'S YOUR FAULT.

93
00:02:24,533 --> 00:02:26,467
>> MY FAULT?

94
00:02:26,467 --> 00:02:27,967
YOU KNEW THAT I WAS NOT ON

95
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:28,967
BIRTH CONTROL.

96
00:02:28,967 --> 00:02:29,967
>> I HATE CONDOMS.

97
00:02:29,967 --> 00:02:30,967
I DON'T LIKE THE WORD.

98
00:02:30,967 --> 00:02:32,367
I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA.

99
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:33,367
IT'S LIKE PUNISHMENT.

100
00:02:33,367 --> 00:02:35,200
>> THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS.

101
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,533
WE CAN'T AFFORD THIS ONE.

102
00:02:36,533 --> 00:02:38,800
SHE'S COMING IN TWO MONTHS.

103
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
IF WE'RE HERE, WHERE ARE WE

104
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:41,267
GONNA PUT HER, ON THE FLOOR?

105
00:02:41,267 --> 00:02:43,067
ONCE TIME GETS CLOSER,

106
00:02:43,067 --> 00:02:45,200
IT'S NOT GONNA FLY ANYMORE.

107
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,500
IF I WAS TO GO INTO LABOR,

108
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,400
WHERE THE HECK ARE WE SUPPOSED

109
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,167
TO BRING HER HOME?

110
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:49,867
>> I KNOW.

111
00:02:49,867 --> 00:02:50,600
I'LL DO MY PART.

112
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,067
I'M GONNA LOOK FOR A JOB.

113
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:53,067
>> DEREK AND I ARE RUNNING OUT

114
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:54,367
OF PLACES WHERE WE CAN BOTH

115
00:02:54,367 --> 00:02:55,967
STAY, AND SOMETIMES I NEED

116
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:57,367
A BREAK FROM PATRICK'S.

117
00:02:57,367 --> 00:02:58,600
LUCKILY, MY FRIEND SUGAR

118
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,700
WILL ALWAYS COME PICK ME UP,

119
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,433
SO I CAN CRASH AT HER HOUSE.

120
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:02,233
>> ALL RIGHT, SHOW ME WHERE

121
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:02,900
YOU SLEEP.

122
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,733
>> ON THE--

123
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:05,967
RIGHT THERE.

124
00:03:05,967 --> 00:03:07,100
ON THE FUTON.

125
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:07,967
>> IS THAT EVEN COMFORTABLE

126
00:03:07,967 --> 00:03:08,633
FOR YOU?

127
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:09,300
>> YEAH, THAT'S--

128
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,100
>> ARE YOU OKAY WITH THAT?

129
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,767
>> YEAH.

130
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:11,433
DOESN'T BOTHER ME.

131
00:03:11,433 --> 00:03:12,167
>> WHERE DO YOU EVEN KEEP

132
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:12,800
YOUR CLOTHES AT?

133
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,900
>> WELL, IT WAS IN BAGS

134
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,567
RIGHT THERE, BUT THERE'S CLOTHES

135
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:16,733
ALL OVER THE FLOOR NOW.

136
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:18,833
>> OH.

137
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:20,867
SO WHAT DID YOU GUYS DO

138
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,500
LAST NIGHT, SINCE, YOU KNOW,

139
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,933
YOU SEEM ALL TIRED?

140
00:03:23,933 --> 00:03:25,433
>> THIS RIGHT HERE.

141
00:03:25,433 --> 00:03:26,100
>> THE FUNNY THING IS,

142
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:26,833
THEY'RE NOT KIDDING.

143
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:27,700
THIS IS WHAT THEY DO.

144
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,567
>> THIS IS WHAT YOU GUYS REALLY

145
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:29,233
DO.

146
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:30,233
>> I ATE SOME NASTY HOT DOGS

147
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:31,233
AND FELT REALLY SICK TO MY

148
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:31,900
STOMACH.

149
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:33,300
>> OH, THEY WERE--IT WAS KINDA--

150
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,300
>> IT WAS DISGUSTING.

151
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,133
>> WHERE'S YOUR JOB, DEREK?

152
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:36,200
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU GOT A JOB.

153
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,200
>> YEAH, I'M A PROFESSIONAL

154
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,100
VIDEO GAME PLAYER.

155
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,133
>> I THINK YOU SHOULD ACTUALLY,

156
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:42,400
LIKE, GO AND GET A JOB,

157
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,667
JUST, MAYBE.

158
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:45,067
>> I SHOULD, YOU'RE RIGHT.

159
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:46,133
>> WELL, HOW SOON--

160
00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:47,133
YOU KNOW, THE BABY'S DUE IN,

161
00:03:47,133 --> 00:03:48,833
LIKE, A MONTH AND A HALF NOW.

162
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,633
YOU'RE NOT GETTING NERVOUS?

163
00:03:50,633 --> 00:03:53,667
>> NO.

164
00:03:53,667 --> 00:03:54,667
>> YOU'RE NOT GETTING BOTHERED

165
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:55,400
BY IT RIGHT NOW?

166
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:57,267
>> I MEAN, IT IS WHAT IT IS.

167
00:03:57,267 --> 00:03:58,533
>> HONESTLY, DEREK, YOU NEED

168
00:03:58,533 --> 00:03:59,333
TO STEP UP MORE.

169
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:00,233
SHE HAS NEEDS.

170
00:04:00,233 --> 00:04:02,067
SHE REALLY NEEDS HELP.

171
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:02,900
>> SHE DOES?

172
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:03,733
>> YEAH.

173
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:04,567
AND I KNOW YOU CAN'T REALLY

174
00:04:04,567 --> 00:04:05,533
SEE THAT, BECAUSE YOU'RE LOOKING

175
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:06,233
AT THE GAME RIGHT NOW,

176
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:07,067
BUT SHE DOES.

177
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:10,100
>> YOU NEED HELP, BABY?

178
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,100
>> STEP UP AND SAY YOU NEED

179
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:11,800
HELP.

180
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,467
>> YES.

181
00:04:12,467 --> 00:04:13,133
>> SHE NEEDS HELP.

182
00:04:13,133 --> 00:04:13,800
SHE NEEDS MORE HELP.

183
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,467
>> I DO.

184
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:15,467
>> SHE NEEDS TO EAT MORE.

185
00:04:15,467 --> 00:04:17,100
SHE NEEDS TO HAVE A BED.

186
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,467
SHE NEEDS TO HAVE HELP

187
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:19,300
WITH MONEY.

188
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,300
DON'T YOU WANT BETTER FOR YOUR

189
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:22,300
KID?

190
00:04:24,467 --> 00:04:25,667
>> IT'S FRUSTRATING THAT DEREK

191
00:04:25,667 --> 00:04:26,667
ISN'T TAKING PARENTHOOD

192
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:27,600
SERIOUSLY.

193
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,333
I'M GLAD I HAVE SUGAR'S SUPPORT,

194
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,533
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE SHE GOT

195
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:31,500
PREGNANT AROUND THE SAME TIME

196
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,233
AS ME.

197
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:33,233
BUT SHE ENDED UP MAKING

198
00:04:33,233 --> 00:04:34,900
A DIFFERENT DECISION.

199
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,900
>> WHEN YOU FIGURED OUT YOU WERE

200
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,100
PREGNANT, WHAT WAS YOUR FIRST

201
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:37,833
REACTION?

202
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:39,467
>> I CRIED IN THE OFFICE.

203
00:04:39,467 --> 00:04:40,467
WHEN THEY CALLED ME BACK THERE,

204
00:04:40,467 --> 00:04:42,267
AND THE WOMAN, SHE WAS LIKE,

205
00:04:42,267 --> 00:04:44,133
"YEAH, YOU'RE PREGNANT."

206
00:04:44,133 --> 00:04:45,467
>> HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT

207
00:04:45,467 --> 00:04:46,267
AN ABORTION?

208
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:47,833
>> I KNOW I COULDN'T DO THAT.

209
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:48,833
>> WHEN I GOT PREGNANT,

210
00:04:48,833 --> 00:04:49,933
I JUST DECIDED TO GET AN

211
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:52,133
ABORTION, BECAUSE I FELT LIKE,

212
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:53,900
IN A SENSE, I WAS STILL A KID,

213
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,300
AND IT WAS KIND OF LIKE,

214
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,400
I DON'T FEEL LIKE I CAN HANDLE

215
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,367
THAT TYPE OF PRESSURE YET.

216
00:04:57,367 --> 00:04:59,400
>> YEAH, BUT I WASN'T GONNA BE,

217
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,467
LIKE, "OH, YOU MADE THE WRONG

218
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:01,400
DECISION."

219
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,567
'CAUSE NOW I SEE THAT, YOU KNOW,

220
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:03,933
YOUR LIFE STILL GETS TO MOVE

221
00:05:03,933 --> 00:05:06,133
FORWARD, AND I'M MOVING FORWARD

222
00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:07,400
IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION.

223
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,100
IF I COULD GO TO COLLEGE

224
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,767
RIGHT NOW, BELIEVE ME, I WOULD.

225
00:05:10,767 --> 00:05:11,567
>> DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU GUYS

226
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:13,400
HAVE GROWN MORE CLOSER,

227
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,267
OR APART, SINCE ALL THIS HAS

228
00:05:15,267 --> 00:05:16,200
BEEN GOING ON?

229
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,633
>> CLOSER, ACTUALLY.

230
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:18,767
WITH ALL THIS MOVING AROUND,

231
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:19,767
I WISH I COULD JUST FIND

232
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:20,833
SOMEWHERE TO STAY, LIKE,

233
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,067
LONG-TERM.

234
00:05:22,067 --> 00:05:22,933
PATRICK, LIKE--

235
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:23,767
I DON'T MIND STAYING THERE

236
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:24,467
AT ALL,

237
00:05:24,467 --> 00:05:25,933
BUT IT'S LIKE,

238
00:05:25,933 --> 00:05:27,467
HE HAS A LOT OF HIS FRIENDS

239
00:05:27,467 --> 00:05:28,933
COME OVER AND STUFF LIKE THAT,

240
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:30,567
AND THEN I'M PREGNANT,

241
00:05:30,567 --> 00:05:32,300
SO I NEED TO SLEEP EARLIER

242
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,733
THAN ALL OF THEM.

243
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:34,833
AND IF WE'RE IN THE LIVING ROOM

244
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:35,733
AND THEY'RE ALL TRYING TO HANG

245
00:05:35,733 --> 00:05:36,467
OUT IN THE LIVING ROOM,

246
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:37,400
I'M FALLING ASLEEP AND I JUST

247
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,667
FEEL RUDE.

248
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:39,833
>> I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE YOU HERE

249
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:41,467
ALL THE TIME, HONESTLY,

250
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:43,300
BUT IT'S KIND OF LIKE MORE

251
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:44,833
OF A RESPECT THING, YOU KNOW.

252
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:45,567
>> YEAH.

253
00:05:45,567 --> 00:05:46,467
>> I DON'T THINK MY MOM WILL

254
00:05:46,467 --> 00:05:47,200
WANT, LIKE, SOME GUY JUST

255
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,933
SLEEPING ON THE COUCH EVERY

256
00:05:47,933 --> 00:05:48,567
NIGHT, BECAUSE--

257
00:05:48,567 --> 00:05:49,200
>> YEAH, OF COURSE.

258
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:49,900
NO, I UNDERSTAND.

259
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,567
>> YOU KNOW.

260
00:05:50,567 --> 00:05:52,567
>> I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND THAT.

261
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,067
>> ALL RIGHT.

262
00:05:55,067 --> 00:05:55,667
>> OH, GOD.

263
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:56,367
>> SO YOU READY FOR BED?

264
00:05:56,367 --> 00:05:58,467
>> YES.

265
00:05:58,467 --> 00:05:59,467
>> HOW'S IT FEEL SLEEPING

266
00:05:59,467 --> 00:06:00,567
IN A BED NOW?

267
00:06:00,567 --> 00:06:02,333
>> GREAT.

268
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,500
>> * OH, OH

269
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,433
* OH, OH, OH, OH

270
00:06:06,433 --> 00:06:07,433
>> IT WAS NICE SPENDING THE

271
00:06:07,433 --> 00:06:08,433
NIGHT AT SUGAR'S,

272
00:06:08,433 --> 00:06:09,700
BUT DEREK AND I NEED A PERMANENT

273
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:12,300
PLACE TO GET READY FOR THE BABY.

274
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,667
THE ONLY PEOPLE I'M SPEAKING TO

275
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:14,833
FROM MY FAMILY RIGHT NOW

276
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,100
ARE MY GRANDMOTHER AND AUNT.

277
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,067
I REALLY HOPE THEY CAN

278
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:18,167
HELP US OUT.

279
00:06:18,167 --> 00:06:19,067
>> IT'S HUGE.

280
00:06:19,067 --> 00:06:20,067
>> I KNOW.

281
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:21,133
>> GOTTEN BIGGER SINCE THE LAST

282
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:23,067
TIME.

283
00:06:23,067 --> 00:06:24,400
SO HOW YOU DOING?

284
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,700
>> GOOD.

285
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,800
>> HAVE YOU SPOKEN TO YOUR DAD

286
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,600
LATELY?

287
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,267
>> NO.

288
00:06:28,267 --> 00:06:29,733
NOT SINCE I LEFT.

289
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:31,900
I GET WHY, IN HIS MIND,

290
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,733
MY DAD ASKED DEREK TO LEAVE.

291
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:34,767
THAT'S NOT A LOGICAL REASON

292
00:06:34,767 --> 00:06:35,667
TO ME, BUT, WHATEVER.

293
00:06:35,667 --> 00:06:36,500
IT'S NOT MY HOUSE.

294
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:39,067
BUT FOR YOU TO GET MAD AT ME--

295
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:40,100
YOU KNOW, WE'RE NOT MARRIED,

296
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,067
FINE, BUT HE'S THE FATHER

297
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:41,700
OF MY CHILD...

298
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,400
>> RIGHT.

299
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,400
>> WHO LOVES ME AND LOVES

300
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,567
THE BABY AND IS WILLING TO BE

301
00:06:44,567 --> 00:06:45,567
THERE FOR ME.

302
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:46,567
AND YOU WANT ME TO WALK AWAY

303
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:47,900
FROM HIM TO BE WITH--

304
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,133
TO STAY WITH YOU.

305
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:50,133
>> THAT'S MY SON,

306
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:52,367
AND I HATE TO SEE HIM DO THIS

307
00:06:52,367 --> 00:06:53,100
TO YOU.

308
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,067
>> RIGHT NOW WE HAVE NO MEANS

309
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:56,733
OF SUPPORTING A BABY.

310
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:58,067
I HAVE NO BANK ACCOUNT,

311
00:06:58,067 --> 00:06:59,200
'CAUSE I NEVER NEEDED ONE,

312
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,433
SO I HAVE NO MONEY SAVED UP

313
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:01,833
WHATSOEVER.

314
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,300
HIS IS IN THE NEGATIVE.

315
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:04,967
>> I GOT PAID TODAY.

316
00:07:04,967 --> 00:07:06,367
I CAN GIVE YOU SOME MONEY

317
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:07,200
FOR GAS OR--

318
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,200
>> I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE

319
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,067
TO DO THAT.

320
00:07:09,067 --> 00:07:10,067
>> BUT YOU'RE STILL GONNA TAKE

321
00:07:10,067 --> 00:07:11,467
SOME MONEY TONIGHT TO PUT GAS

322
00:07:11,467 --> 00:07:12,333
IN THAT CAR.

323
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:13,633
GOT IT?

324
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:14,633
>> THANK YOU.

325
00:07:14,633 --> 00:07:15,333
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

326
00:07:15,333 --> 00:07:17,067
>> 'CAUSE IT WILL HELP.

327
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:17,867
>> I MEAN, THINGS ARE GOING

328
00:07:17,867 --> 00:07:20,067
TO BE ROUGH.

329
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:21,300
THEY ARE, YOU KNOW.

330
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,467
I'VE BEEN THERE, DONE THAT.

331
00:07:23,467 --> 00:07:24,433
>> WOULD WE BE ABLE TO STAY

332
00:07:24,433 --> 00:07:26,933
HERE?

333
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:27,833
>> DO--

334
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:30,833
>> WE--WE CAN'T.

335
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:33,633
THERE'S NO ROOM.

336
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:35,333
WE WISH YOU COULD STAY HERE.

337
00:07:35,333 --> 00:07:37,933
IT'S JUST TOO--TOO MUCH.

338
00:07:37,933 --> 00:07:40,167
I JUST WISHED IT WAS BETTER

339
00:07:40,167 --> 00:07:41,067
FOR YOU.

340
00:07:41,067 --> 00:07:42,067
>> YEAH, WELL, IT'S NOT GONNA

341
00:07:42,067 --> 00:07:43,067
BE, SO I JUST GOT TO MAKE

342
00:07:43,067 --> 00:07:45,067
THE BEST OUT OF IT.

343
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:04,167
>> OUR DAUGHTER WILL BE HERE

344
00:08:04,167 --> 00:08:05,167
IN SIX WEEKS,

345
00:08:05,167 --> 00:08:06,167
AND AFTER GETTING TURNED DOWN

346
00:08:06,167 --> 00:08:07,933
BY MY GRANDMOTHER, DEREK DECIDED

347
00:08:07,933 --> 00:08:09,333
TO REACH OUT TO HIS DAD,

348
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,233
WHO LIVES IN TEXAS,

349
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:12,233
TO SEE IF HE HAS ANY OPTIONS.

350
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:14,900
>> WANT TO GO IN THERE?

351
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,900
>> YEAH, IT'S PROBABLY WARM.

352
00:08:18,733 --> 00:08:19,733
>> HI, DAD.

353
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:21,100
>> HEY, WHAT'S UP?

354
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,100
>> NOTHING'S REALLY CHANGED

355
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,067
SINCE YOU LEFT.

356
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:24,300
WE STILL DON'T REALLY KNOW

357
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,300
WHERE TO GO OR WHERE TO STAY.

358
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:29,333
>> I KNOW IT UPSETS YOU THAT

359
00:08:29,333 --> 00:08:31,333
I MADE THE SAME MISTAKE AS YOU.

360
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,500
>> FOR REAL, DAD.

361
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:43,200
DO YOU HAVE ANY--

362
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,200
WHAT CAN WE DO?

363
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,200
WHAT SHOULD WE DO?

364
00:08:49,667 --> 00:08:50,367
>> WE CAN'T DO THAT.

365
00:08:50,367 --> 00:08:51,400
>> BUT WE ALSO--

366
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,400
>> MY MEDICAL INSURANCE DOESN'T

367
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,600
SWITCH OVER.

368
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,233
>> I DON'T THAT HER MEDICAL

369
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:57,233
INSURANCE WILL SWITCH OVER.

370
00:09:09,333 --> 00:09:10,500
>> I'M GONNA CALL HER AND SEE

371
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,633
WHAT--SEE WHAT SHE HAS TO SAY.

372
00:09:12,633 --> 00:09:13,633
ALL RIGHT, DAD, WELL,

373
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:15,067
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

374
00:09:15,067 --> 00:09:16,067
>> FEEL WEIRD STAYING WITH

375
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:18,367
SOMEONE I'VE NEVER EVEN MET.

376
00:09:18,367 --> 00:09:20,733
>> BETTER THAN A BACK SEAT.

377
00:09:20,733 --> 00:09:22,233
WE CAN'T GO TO TEXAS.

378
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:23,867
CAN'T KEEP STAYING AT PATRICK'S.

379
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:24,867
>> WHAT IF SHE'S, LIKE,

380
00:09:24,867 --> 00:09:25,533
A PSYCHO?

381
00:09:25,533 --> 00:09:26,533
>> YOU THINK DAD WOULD OFFER US

382
00:09:26,533 --> 00:09:27,533
TO GO STAY SOMEWHERE THAT WASN'T

383
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:28,200
SAFE?

384
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,867
>> NO.

385
00:09:28,867 --> 00:09:29,533
>> RIGHT.

386
00:09:29,533 --> 00:09:31,267
I'VE KNOWN HER SINCE I WAS

387
00:09:31,267 --> 00:09:32,300
A LITTLE BOY.

388
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,067
>> I'M JUST SAYING...

389
00:09:33,067 --> 00:09:33,767
>> SHE'S NOT GONNA--

390
00:09:33,767 --> 00:09:34,500
>> SHE COULD THROW US OUT

391
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,200
LIKE OTHER PEOPLE HAVE.

392
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,867
>> NO.

393
00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:40,067
JORDAN, YOUR PARENTS ARE UNIQUE.

394
00:09:40,067 --> 00:09:42,433
THEY ARE ONE-OF-A-KIND.

395
00:09:42,433 --> 00:09:43,967
SHE'S NOT GONNA DO THAT TO US.

396
00:09:43,967 --> 00:09:46,433
>> WELL...

397
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:49,233
BEGGARS CAN'T BE CHOOSERS.

398
00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:52,600
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

399
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:53,933
>> SINCE WE'VE RUN OUT OF

400
00:09:53,933 --> 00:09:54,933
OPTIONS,

401
00:09:54,933 --> 00:09:55,933
DEREK CALLED TRACY,

402
00:09:55,933 --> 00:09:57,933
AND SHE INVITED US OVER TO TALK.

403
00:09:57,933 --> 00:09:59,067
[knock on door]

404
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:00,600
HI.

405
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,433
>> HEY, GUYS.

406
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:02,667
>> HEY, WHAT'S UP?

407
00:10:02,667 --> 00:10:03,467
>> HOW ARE YOU?

408
00:10:03,467 --> 00:10:04,167
>> GOOD.

409
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:05,000
>> WHY DON'T WE JUST, UM,

410
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,433
GO HEAD OVER TO THE DINING ROOM

411
00:10:06,433 --> 00:10:07,300
AND SIT DOWN SO WE CAN TALK.

412
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,300
>> OKAY.

413
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,300
>> SO I'M REALLY GLAD YOU GUYS

414
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,133
COULD COME OVER TODAY.

415
00:10:10,133 --> 00:10:11,367
I'VE BEEN TALKING TO YOUR DAD,

416
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:12,367
DEREK, ABOUT YOUR GUYS'

417
00:10:12,367 --> 00:10:13,200
SITUATION.

418
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,533
NOW WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN STAYING?

419
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:15,533
>> WE'VE BEEN SLEEPING ON

420
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:16,367
FLOORS,

421
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:18,367
MATTRESSES ON THE GROUND.

422
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:19,433
JUST ANYWHERE.

423
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:20,433
THIS WHOLE SITUATION HAS BEEN

424
00:10:20,433 --> 00:10:21,500
STRESSFUL FOR HER,

425
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,233
AND SHE CAN'T REALLY--

426
00:10:22,233 --> 00:10:22,867
>> YEAH.

427
00:10:22,867 --> 00:10:23,767
>> CAN'T REALLY PUT HER THROUGH

428
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:24,433
TOO MUCH MORE.

429
00:10:24,433 --> 00:10:25,100
>> NO.

430
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,367
AS A YOUNG WOMAN, YOU NEED

431
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:28,500
SOMEONE ELSE IN YOUR CORNER--

432
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,767
ANOTHER WOMAN FIGURE.

433
00:10:29,767 --> 00:10:31,400
I'M NOT TRYING TO BE YOUR MOM,

434
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
BUT I'VE HAD THREE KIDS.

435
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,433
I'VE BEEN PREGNANT THREE TIMES,

436
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:34,200
SO--

437
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,033
>> DO YOU NEED ANYTHING FROM US?

438
00:10:36,033 --> 00:10:38,200
OBVIOUSLY, I WANT TO GET A JOB.

439
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,200
>> I'M NOT GONNA SAY,

440
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,533
"I NEED THIS MUCH MONEY

441
00:10:40,533 --> 00:10:41,633
EVERY MONTH FOR YOU TO BE HERE."

442
00:10:41,633 --> 00:10:42,300
>> RIGHT.

443
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:43,300
>> I--UNTIL YOU GUYS GET ON

444
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,733
YOUR FEET, I WILL DO WHATEVER

445
00:10:44,733 --> 00:10:45,933
I CAN DO, AS LONG AS YOU GUYS

446
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:48,067
RESPECT ME AND RESPECT,

447
00:10:48,067 --> 00:10:49,200
YOU KNOW,

448
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,000
MY CHILDREN AND THEIR HOME.

449
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,933
>> EVERYBODY IN THE HOUSE, YEAH.

450
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:51,933
>> THAT'S REALLY, REALLY

451
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:52,700
GENEROUS OF YOU,

452
00:10:52,700 --> 00:10:53,933
AND I'M REALLY APPRECIATIVE

453
00:10:53,933 --> 00:10:54,633
OF IT.

454
00:10:54,633 --> 00:10:56,100
>> I KNOW IT'S NOT A BEDROOM,

455
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,000
BUT I WANTED TO OFFER YOU

456
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
MY LIVING ROOM.

457
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,400
I HAVE TWO TWIN MATTRESSES...

458
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,067
>> MM-HMM.

459
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:02,133
>> THAT YOU COULD PUT TOGETHER.

460
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:03,600
>> DO YOU NEED ANY TIME TO,

461
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,600
LIKE, THINK THIS OVER,

462
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,600
OR CONTEMPLATE IDEAS?

463
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,267
>> NO.

464
00:11:07,267 --> 00:11:07,933
>> YOU'RE SOLD.

465
00:11:07,933 --> 00:11:08,600
>> YEP.

466
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,767
>> LOOK AT HER BIG, GIANT SMILE.

467
00:11:09,767 --> 00:11:10,933
SHE'S LIKE, "YES."

468
00:11:10,933 --> 00:11:11,933
LET'S GO LOOK AT IT REAL QUICK

469
00:11:11,933 --> 00:11:13,200
AND JUST SEE IF WE CAN FIGURE

470
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,067
OUT WHERE WE'RE GONNA PUT

471
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:16,700
THINGS, OR WHATEVER.

472
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,700
HERE'S THE ROOM.

473
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:21,533
I WAS THINKING,

474
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:22,533
IF YOU GUYS WANT TO PUT, LIKE,

475
00:11:22,533 --> 00:11:24,367
THE SEATING AREA OVER THIS WAY

476
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:25,233
AND THEN YOU COULD PROBABLY

477
00:11:25,233 --> 00:11:26,567
PUT THE BED--YOUR BED, LIKE,

478
00:11:26,567 --> 00:11:27,233
OVER HERE.

479
00:11:27,233 --> 00:11:28,167
>> YEAH, IN THE CORNER.

480
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:29,167
>> WE CAN MOVE THINGS AROUND,

481
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:29,867
LIKE--

482
00:11:29,867 --> 00:11:30,867
>> ALTHOUGH BABY STUFF DOES

483
00:11:30,867 --> 00:11:32,467
TAKE UP A LOT, SO, YEAH.

484
00:11:32,467 --> 00:11:33,300
>> WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT.

485
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,300
>> A LOT BETTER THAN BEING

486
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,167
ON THE FLOOR.

487
00:11:35,167 --> 00:11:37,967
>> YEAH.

488
00:11:37,967 --> 00:11:39,967
>> THAT'S MY LITTLE BOY.

489
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:43,200
>> HE'S LIKE, "WHAT THE HECK?"

490
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:43,967
>> ALL RIGHT, GUYS.

491
00:11:43,967 --> 00:11:44,633
>> ALL RIGHTY,

492
00:11:44,633 --> 00:11:45,367
WE'LL CALL YOU LATER.

493
00:11:45,367 --> 00:11:47,300
>> YEP.

494
00:11:55,667 --> 00:11:57,833
>> THERE'S HARDENED DOG POOP.

495
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:58,767
>> YOU'RE IN CHARGE OF THAT ONE,

496
00:11:58,767 --> 00:11:59,433
HOMEY.

497
00:11:59,433 --> 00:12:00,333
>> EW.

498
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,067
OH...

499
00:12:02,067 --> 00:12:03,567
>> THE DOG POOP IS SO HARD.

500
00:12:03,567 --> 00:12:04,867
IT'S BEEN BACK HERE PROBABLY

501
00:12:04,867 --> 00:12:05,733
FOR YEARS.

502
00:12:05,733 --> 00:12:06,733
>> WE DON'T NEED HER PICKING UP

503
00:12:06,733 --> 00:12:08,567
DOG POOP AND EATING IT.

504
00:12:08,567 --> 00:12:10,333
WE'LL GET THIS AREA CLEANED,

505
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,067
WE'LL PUT THE BEDS HERE,

506
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:13,867
AND THEN...

507
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,867
SWEEP, VACUUM, MOP.

508
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:33,900
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DEFINITELY

509
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:36,067
FEBREZE AND SPRAY.

510
00:12:36,067 --> 00:12:37,300
>> IT'S BETTER THAN THE FLOOR.

511
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,067
>> IT IS.

512
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:39,067
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SUCK IT UP

513
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:40,800
AND MAKE SACRIFICES.

514
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,833
>> * OH, OH, OH, OH

515
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:48,200
* OH, OH

516
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,067
>> [gasps]

517
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:50,067
MY NAIL ALREADY CHIPPED.

518
00:12:50,067 --> 00:12:52,600
>> NO!

519
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,600
>> LOOK AT IT.

520
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,433
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

521
00:12:54,433 --> 00:12:57,267
>> WHAT?

522
00:12:57,267 --> 00:13:00,800
DO YOU AND DEREK STILL DO IT?

523
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:01,567
>> SERIOUSLY.

524
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,367
>> DO YOU?

525
00:13:02,367 --> 00:13:03,900
>> I CHOOSE NOT TO.

526
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:05,400
>> I HEARD, LIKE, SOME PEOPLE,

527
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,433
LIKE, WHEN THEY'RE PREGNANT,

528
00:13:06,433 --> 00:13:08,067
LIKE, THEY WANT IT MORE.

529
00:13:08,067 --> 00:13:09,067
CAN YOU GET PREGNANT

530
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:10,967
WHILE YOU'RE PREGNANT?

531
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:12,467
>> WHAT?

532
00:13:12,467 --> 00:13:13,200
NO.

533
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,733
>> OH.

534
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:16,500
>> ARE YOU SENSITIVE ABOUT

535
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,500
THE WAY YOUR BODY LOOKS?

536
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,167
>> YES.

537
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:19,967
I HAVE MY BIG OL' BELLY, AND--

538
00:13:19,967 --> 00:13:21,067
>> MAKES EVERYTHING DIFFICULT.

539
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:22,100
>> IT'S JUST--YEAH.

540
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:22,933
>> IS THERE ANYTHING YOU'RE

541
00:13:22,933 --> 00:13:23,933
SUPER EXCITED ABOUT?

542
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:24,833
>> JUST HAVING HER THERE.

543
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:25,900
'CAUSE IT'S LIKE, YOU GET

544
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,167
SO USED TO HAVING SOMEONE

545
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:28,600
IN YOUR STOMACH, LIKE--

546
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,600
>> DO YOU FEEL LIKE IT'LL GIVE

547
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,700
YOU CLOSURE, LIKE YOU HAVE

548
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,733
A FAMILY THAT'S, LIKE,

549
00:13:31,733 --> 00:13:32,400
ALL TOGETHER?

550
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,133
>> YEAH, AS LONG AS WE GET

551
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:35,467
EVERYTHING TOGETHER BEFORE

552
00:13:35,467 --> 00:13:36,300
SHE COMES.

553
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,133
>> YOU DEFINITELY WANT

554
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:38,067
A BABY SHOWER, RIGHT?

555
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,067
>> YEAH, AND I THINK EVERY

556
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:40,500
PREGNANT PERSON WANTS A BABY--

557
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:41,767
LIKE, IT'S A BIG DEAL.

558
00:13:41,767 --> 00:13:42,800
>> ME AND MY MOM--

559
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,800
WE DEFINITELY WANT TO DO ONE

560
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:44,567
FOR YOU.

561
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:45,300
>> YEAH.

562
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,200
>> YOU KNOW, I THINK YOU DESERVE

563
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,067
ONE.

I THINK IT'LL HELP YOU A LOT,

565
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:49,333
BECAUSE YOU REALLY HAVE,

566
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:50,700
YOU KNOW, NOTHING RIGHT NOW.

567
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,367
>> I'D LOVE THAT.

568
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:53,067
THANK YOU.

569
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:54,533
AND I HONESTLY DON'T EVEN WANT

570
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:56,400
TO INVITE MY DAD OR MY MOM.

571
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,767
I REALLY DON'T CARE AT ALL.

572
00:13:58,767 --> 00:14:00,100
I REFUSE TO TALK TO THEM

573
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:01,833
EVER AGAIN.

574
00:14:01,833 --> 00:14:04,433
>> * OUT ON THE STREETS

575
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:06,800
*HELD OUT HIS HAND *

576
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,200
* AND DROPPED TO HIS FEET

577
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,133
>> [grunts]

578
00:14:11,133 --> 00:14:12,133
>> WE HAVE THE TABLE READY

579
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:14,967
FOR YOU TO MAKE THE FAVORS.

580
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:16,167
>> I'M REALLY, REALLY THANKFUL

581
00:14:16,167 --> 00:14:17,100
AND HAPPY THAT YOU GUYS HAVE

582
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,333
MADE IT, YOU KNOW, THIS MUCH

583
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,300
EASIER, THAT NOW WE WILL HAVE

584
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,300
STUFF THAT WILL HELP OUT,

585
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,700
BECAUSE WE HAVE LITERALLY

586
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,600
NOTHING RIGHT NOW.

587
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,600
>> WE'RE GLAD TO REALLY HELP

588
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,267
YOU.

589
00:14:25,267 --> 00:14:26,100
WE REALLY ARE.

590
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,367
>> SO HOW ARE THINGS AT TRACY'S,

591
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,200
JORDAN?

592
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:29,200
>> I MEAN, I'M NOT REALLY

593
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,433
COMPLAINING, BECAUSE IT'S A LOT

594
00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:31,933
BETTER NOW THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE

595
00:14:31,933 --> 00:14:32,933
AN AREA TO SLEEP ON.

596
00:14:32,933 --> 00:14:34,300
THIS WILL NOT BE A PERMANENT

597
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,067
SITUATION.

598
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:36,067
THERE'S NOT EVEN ENOUGH ROOM.

599
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:38,667
>> ONCE THE BABY SHOWER'S DONE,

600
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:39,833
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO

601
00:14:39,833 --> 00:14:41,900
FINANCIALLY AFTER THAT?

602
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,900
>> DEREK'S JUST GONNA START

603
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,300
LOOKING FOR A JOB

604
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,200
SO HE'S AT LEAST WORKING.

605
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,833
>> START LOOKING FOR A JOB?

606
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,500
HE HASN'T STARTED?

607
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,500
IF DEREK GETS SCARED,

608
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,500
HE'S GONNA PROBABLY RUN TO HIS

609
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,467
DAD.

610
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:53,500
>> AND THEN I'M SCREWED.

611
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:54,900
>> WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IF DEREK

612
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,833
DOESN'T COME THROUGH?

613
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:57,667
>> I DON'T KNOW.

614
00:14:57,667 --> 00:14:58,567
I CAN'T WORK RIGHT NOW.

615
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:00,467
NOBODY'S GONNA HIRE ME.

616
00:15:00,467 --> 00:15:01,767
>> WHAT WOULD YOU DO FOR MONEY

617
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:03,933
TO FEED THE BABY AND CLOTHE IT?

618
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:04,833
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

619
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,067
I HAVE NO IDEA.

620
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:07,067
>> IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANOTHER

621
00:15:07,067 --> 00:15:09,067
OPTION, YOUR BABY DOESN'T HAVE

622
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:11,200
ANYTHING.

623
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,533
WHAT DO OTHER GIRLS DO

624
00:15:12,533 --> 00:15:13,633
IN YOUR SITUATION?

625
00:15:13,633 --> 00:15:15,067
BECAUSE LIVING IN SOMEONE ELSE'S

626
00:15:15,067 --> 00:15:16,900
HOME IS NOT ALWAYS THE BEST

627
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:17,633
THING.

628
00:15:17,633 --> 00:15:18,633
>> THEY EITHER GO TO A HOMELESS

629
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:20,700
SHELTER, BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S

630
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,700
THERE, AND THEN THEY HAVE TO GO

631
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,833
TO SOUP KITCHENS AND STUFF

632
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:24,500
LIKE THAT.

633
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:25,633
>> LIKE, I'M REALLY PISSED OFF,

634
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,633
BECAUSE SHE'S THINKING HER ONLY

635
00:15:26,633 --> 00:15:27,400
OPTION RIGHT NOW...

636
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:28,100
>> YEAH.

637
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:28,900
>> IS A HOMELESS SHELTER.

638
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,767
>> IS A HOMELESS SHELTER.

639
00:15:29,767 --> 00:15:30,600
>> AND THAT'S REALLY MAKING

640
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,467
ME IRRITATED.

641
00:15:31,467 --> 00:15:32,567
YOU DO HAVE ANOTHER OPTION.

642
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:33,633
IT'S FOR DEREK TO WORK.

643
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:35,633
AND HE'S NOT WORKING.

644
00:15:40,067 --> 00:15:41,067
>> IT'S STRESSFUL ENOUGH

645
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:42,067
BEING A TEENAGER ON TOP OF

646
00:15:42,067 --> 00:15:43,167
HAVING YOUR FIRST BABY,

647
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:44,867
AND THEN NOT HAVING A STABLE

648
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:45,933
PLACE WHERE YOU KNOW YOU'RE

649
00:15:45,933 --> 00:15:47,067
GONNA LIVE ON TOP OF ALL OF

650
00:15:47,067 --> 00:15:47,900
THAT.

651
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,267
>> DON'T BE AFRAID.

652
00:15:49,267 --> 00:15:51,467
I WANT HER TO BE STRONG, AND--

653
00:15:51,467 --> 00:15:52,333
>> SHE IS STRONG.

654
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:53,333
SHE MADE IT THIS--SHE MADE IT

655
00:15:53,333 --> 00:15:54,300
THIS FAR WITHOUT FREAKING OUT.

656
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,300
>> I WANT HER TO BE STRONG,

657
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,767
BECAUSE I KNOW SHE CAN DO IT.

658
00:15:56,767 --> 00:15:58,767
THAT'S WHY.

659
00:16:03,867 --> 00:16:05,833
IT'S ALL RIGHT, HONEY.

660
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,167
LISTEN, I'M HERE ANYTIME YOU

661
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:09,167
WANT TO TALK TO US, OKAY?

662
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:21,700
>> OUR DAUGHTER WILL BE HERE

663
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:23,067
IN THREE WEEKS.

664
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:23,933
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE NOT READY,

665
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:25,067
AND DEREK HASN'T LOOKED FOR

666
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:26,333
A JOB, I'M REALLY EXCITED

667
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:28,567
ABOUT BECOMING A MOM.

668
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:29,467
>> WHO DO YOU THINK SHE'S GONNA

669
00:16:29,467 --> 00:16:30,100
LOOK LIKE?

670
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,700
>> YOU.

671
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,700
>> AND THE FIRST THING WE ARE

672
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,067
SEEING IS THAT SHE HAS A LOT

673
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:34,867
OF HAIR.

674
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:37,267
>> LOOK AT HER.

675
00:16:37,267 --> 00:16:38,200
SHE LOOKS JUST LIKE YOU.

676
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,200
SHE'S GOT YOUR NOSE

677
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,067
AND YOUR CHIN.

678
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,067
>> JAY-Z LIP.

679
00:16:43,067 --> 00:16:44,200
>> SHE DOESN'T HAVE A JAY-Z LIP.

680
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,433
>> [laughs]

681
00:16:47,433 --> 00:16:49,300
>> SHE'S CHEWING.

682
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,633
THEY ACTUALLY DRINK THEIR FLUID

683
00:16:50,633 --> 00:16:52,200
WHEN THEY'RE DOING THAT.

684
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:52,933
AND FLUID IS PEE,

685
00:16:52,933 --> 00:16:54,633
IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

686
00:16:54,633 --> 00:16:56,933
>> EW, EVIE, THAT'S DISGUSTING.

687
00:16:56,933 --> 00:16:58,167
>> WELL, MOST OF US TURN OUT

688
00:16:58,167 --> 00:16:59,633
NORMAL, SO.

689
00:16:59,633 --> 00:17:02,233
SHE'S MAYBE ABOUT 8 1/2 POUNDS.

690
00:17:02,233 --> 00:17:03,233
>> [scoffs]

691
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:04,467
MAN.

692
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:06,100
>> WHAT?

693
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:06,800
>> OKAY.

694
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,500
BRING YOUR PICTURES UP

695
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,267
WHENEVER YOU'RE READY.

696
00:17:08,267 --> 00:17:09,067
>> OKAY.

697
00:17:09,067 --> 00:17:09,700
>> THANK YOU.

698
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,567
>> GOOD LUCK.

699
00:17:10,567 --> 00:17:11,400
>> I WONDER WHAT THAT MEANS,

700
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,233
THAT HER HEAD'S A LITTLE BIT

701
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:13,100
BIGGER.

702
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:14,533
>> SHE'S GOT A BIG HEAD.

703
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:15,567
LIKE MOMMY.

704
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:16,633
>> I DON'T WANT TO PUSH A BIG

705
00:17:16,633 --> 00:17:17,833
ROUND HEAD OUT.

706
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,067
I KNOW THIS IS GONNA BE AWFUL

707
00:17:19,067 --> 00:17:19,700
FOR ME.

708
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,867
I'M GONNA WANT TO DIE.

709
00:17:20,867 --> 00:17:21,867
>> IT'LL BE OKAY.

710
00:17:21,867 --> 00:17:23,067
>> NOT REALLY READY FOR HER

711
00:17:23,067 --> 00:17:24,333
TO COME YET.

712
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,800
SHE NEEDS TO STAY IN THERE

713
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:28,067
UNTIL SHE'S SUPPOSED TO COME,

714
00:17:28,067 --> 00:17:28,967

AT THE BABY SHOWER.

718

>> BUT WE'LL GET A LOT MORE

719
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:34,133
THAN WHAT WE HAVE.

720
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:34,900
>> YEAH, WE WILL.

721
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,300
I'M SERIOUS.

722
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,100
AND WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO,

723
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,900
JUST STAY LIVING WITH TRACY?

00:17:44,133 --> 00:17:45,133
WE CAN'T LIVE AT TRACY'S

00:17:45,133 --> 00:17:45,967
FOREVER.

729
00:17:45,967 --> 00:17:46,967
YOU NEED TO START LOOKING

730
00:17:46,967 --> 00:17:47,900
FOR A JOB.

731
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:48,900

DO YOU WANT TO SAY SOMETHING?

>> SO COMPLAINING TO ME

738
00:17:56,467 --> 00:17:57,600
IS GONNA DO WHAT?

>> IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU.

740
00:17:59,567 --> 00:18:01,333

00:23:30,633 --> 00:23:32,067
>> IT JUST STRESSES ME OUT.

941
00:23:32,067 --> 00:23:33,267
>> ALL RIGHT, WELL--

942
00:23:33,267 --> 00:23:34,067

943
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,400
ON BOTH OF US.

944
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,367
>> YOU GUYS ARE VERY IMPORTANT

945
00:23:36,367 --> 00:23:37,067

946
00:23:37,067 --> 00:23:38,833
I'M NOT GOING AWAY.

947
00:23:38,833 --> 00:23:40,833
>> IF YOU SAY SO.

948
00:23:44,733 --> 00:23:46,100
SINCE WE STILL NEED BABY STUFF,

949
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,200
I'M REALLY HAPPY SUGAR AND HER

00:24:05,333 --> 00:24:06,067
ALL THE TIME.

964
00:24:06,067 --> 00:24:06,800
YOU PRACTICALLY LIVED AT MY

965
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,467
HOUSE.

966
00:24:07,467 --> 00:24:08,233
>> EVERY SINGLE WEEKEND.

967
00:24:08,233 --> 00:24:08,900
>> NO, REALLY.

968
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:09,900

969
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:10,833

>> OH, YOU'RE GONNA LOOK

973
00:24:14,067 --> 00:24:14,767
SO PRETTY.

974
00:24:14,767 --> 00:24:16,600
YEAH, ALL I DO NOW IS MOTHERLY

975
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:17,933
THINGS, LIKE THE LAUNDRY

976
00:24:17,933 --> 00:24:18,967
AND CLEAN THE HOUSE AND--

977
00:24:18,967 --> 00:24:21,233
HAD TO GROW UP, I GUESS, SO--

978
00:24:21,233 --> 00:24:23,567
>> ALL RIGHT, PRESENT TIME.

979
00:24:23,567 --> 00:24:24,567
>> OH, THE CLOTHES ARE MY

980
00:24:24,567 --> 00:24:26,567
FAVORITE PART.

981
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:29,067
>> OH, THAT'S NICE.

982
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:30,067
>> LOOK.

983
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:32,633
THEY'RE VERY SUMMERY.

984
00:24:32,633 --> 00:24:34,800
>> OH, I LIKE THE HAT.

985
00:24:37,667 --> 00:24:38,667
>> CAN'T BELIEVE WE GOT

986
00:24:38,667 --> 00:24:39,733
ALL THIS STUFF.

987
00:24:39,733 --> 00:24:40,733
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

988
00:24:40,733 --> 00:24:41,967
WE DIDN'T HAVE, LIKE, ANYTHING.

989
00:24:41,967 --> 00:24:42,967
>> IT MEANS A LOT.

990
00:24:42,967 --> 00:24:44,267
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

991
00:24:44,267 --> 00:24:46,967
>> WE NEEDED IT.

992
00:24:46,967 --> 00:24:48,067
>> I'M GLAD THAT WE FINALLY

993
00:24:48,067 --> 00:24:51,067
HAVE SOME STUFF FOR EVIE.

994
00:24:51,067 --> 00:24:52,467
DEREK EVEN SEEMS TO BE GETTING

995
00:24:52,467 --> 00:24:53,967
SERIOUS ABOUT FINDING A JOB,

996
00:24:53,967 --> 00:24:54,700
WHICH IS GREAT,

997
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:55,533
BECAUSE I'M SICK OF RELYING

998
00:24:55,533 --> 00:24:57,067
ON HANDOUTS.

999
00:24:57,067 --> 00:24:58,267
>> IS IT OKAY IF I USE YOU

1000
00:24:58,267 --> 00:24:59,400
AS A REFERENCE FOR JOB

1001
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,200
APPLICATIONS?

1002
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,667
>> UM, ON ONE CONDITION--

1003
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,333
THAT YOU GET YOUR HAIR CUT.

1004
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:06,167
YOU LOOK LIKE A DIRTY Q-TIP.

1005
00:25:06,167 --> 00:25:06,933
HERE'S THE MONEY FOR IT

1006
00:25:06,933 --> 00:25:08,933
RIGHT NOW.

1007
00:25:12,567 --> 00:25:13,233
>> ALL RIGHT.

1008
00:25:13,233 --> 00:25:13,900
>> THANK YOU.

1009
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,067
>> MM-HMM, THANK YOU.

1010
00:25:16,067 --> 00:25:18,067
>> MUCH BETTER.

1011
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:22,167
BUT BEFORE DEREK COULD GO IN

1012
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:23,067
FOR AN INTERVIEW,

1013
00:25:23,067 --> 00:25:24,067
I STARTED FEELING SOMETHING

1014
00:25:24,067 --> 00:25:25,067
STRANGE.

1015
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:26,100
DEREK!

1016
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,467
>> BABY!

1017
00:25:27,467 --> 00:25:28,367
>> COME HERE.

1018
00:25:28,367 --> 00:25:29,467
>> WHAT'S WRONG?

1019
00:25:29,467 --> 00:25:31,500
>> I THINK I'M LEAKING.

1020
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:36,600
>> LET ME SEE.

1021
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,867
>> SEE?

1022
00:25:39,867 --> 00:25:41,400
>> EW, WHAT IS THAT?

1023
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,267
>> IT LOOKS LIKE PEE,

1024
00:25:42,267 --> 00:25:43,667
BUT IT'S CLEAR.

1025
00:25:43,667 --> 00:25:44,633
AND IT KEEPS SOAKING MY

1026
00:25:44,633 --> 00:25:45,433
UNDERWEAR.

1027
00:25:45,433 --> 00:25:47,433
>> CALL MISS TRACY.

1028
00:25:51,833 --> 00:25:52,667
>> HERE WE GO.

1029
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:54,667
>> WE'RE HAVING A BABY.

1030
00:25:57,767 --> 00:25:58,600
>> WHEN I ARRIVED AT THE

1031
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,300

1032
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:00,600
MY DOCTOR CONFIRMED THAT I WAS

1033

1034
00:26:02,067 --> 00:26:03,400
SO HE DECIDED TO INDUCE ME

1035
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:04,100
RIGHT AWAY.

1036
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,100
LET ME TELL YOU,

1037
00:26:05,100 --> 00:26:06,400
THESE CONTRACTIONS ARE NOT FUN.

1038

>> THINK YOU'RE BREATHING WRONG.

1039
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:08,733
>> NO, I'M NOT.

1040
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,600
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO BREATHE

1041
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,300
THEN, GENIUS?

1042
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:10,967

OUCH.

>> THE I.V.

1053
00:26:27,567 --> 00:26:28,533
IT HURTS.

1054

I DO, BECAUSE I GET PERIOD

1058

LIKE, WAY WORSE.

1062
00:26:42,933 --> 00:26:44,233
AFTER NINE HOURS OF LABOR,

1063
00:26:44,233 --> 00:26:45,433
THE NURSE SAID IT WAS FINALLY

1064
00:26:45,433 --> 00:26:46,733

00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,067
>> JUST BECAUSE OF HER?

1310
00:34:41,067 --> 00:34:41,733
>> YEAH.

1311
00:34:41,733 --> 00:34:43,433
LIKE, I FEEL LIKE I ALWAYS HAVE

1312
00:34:43,433 --> 00:34:44,133
STUFF TO DO.

1313
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:45,133
LAUNDRY AND DISHES

1314
00:34:45,133 --> 00:34:45,833
AND WASHING BOTTLES.

1315
00:34:45,833 --> 00:34:47,633
AND IT'S TIME CONSUMING NOW.

1316
00:34:47,633 --> 00:34:48,633
>> EVERY TIME I GO SOMEWHERE,

1317
00:34:48,633 --> 00:34:50,100
I'M LIKE, THIS SUCKS, 'CAUSE,

1318
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,767
LIKE, JORDAN'S NOT WITH ME.

1319
00:34:51,767 --> 00:34:52,700
>> I KNOW.

1320
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,700
I MISS BEING A TEENAGER.

1321
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,367
I REALLY DO.

1322
00:34:54,367 --> 00:34:55,200
BUT THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO

1323
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:55,833
ABOUT IT.

1324
00:34:55,833 --> 00:34:56,500
>> I WOULD TOO.

1325
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,333
>> I WAS LOOKING AT, LIKE,

1326
00:34:57,333 --> 00:34:58,333
OLD PICTURES AND STUFF,

1327
00:34:58,333 --> 00:35:00,100
AND IT'S, LIKE, DEPRESSING.

1328
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,100
I'M TERRIFIED OF GETTING

1329
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,100
PREGNANT AGAIN.

1330
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:02,767
>> YOU ARE?

1331
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:03,600
>> LIKE, I'M TERRIFIED.

1332
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,600
I DON'T WANT ANOTHER BABY.

1333
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:05,767
SO I HAVE SOME NEWS,

1334
00:35:05,767 --> 00:35:07,933
AND I THINK THAT WE MIGHT BE

1335
00:35:07,933 --> 00:35:09,233
MOVING TO TEXAS.

1336
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:10,500
SINCE MISS TRACY'S GONNA BE

1337
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,267
GETTING KICKED OUT,

1338
00:35:11,267 --> 00:35:12,267
WE HAVE NOWHERE TO GO.

1339
00:35:12,267 --> 00:35:13,100
>> WOW.

1340
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,133
THAT'S STUPID.

1341
00:35:14,133 --> 00:35:15,433
>> IT WASN'T MY FIRST CHOICE,

1342
00:35:15,433 --> 00:35:16,467
TO GO TO TEXAS.

1343
00:35:16,467 --> 00:35:17,767
BELIEVE ME.

1344
00:35:17,767 --> 00:35:19,567
BUT DEREK HAS A GUARANTEED JOB

1345
00:35:19,567 --> 00:35:20,967
WORKING FOR A CABLE COMPANY

1346
00:35:20,967 --> 00:35:22,100
WITH HIS DAD.

1347
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:23,333
>> DEREK SHOULD'VE BEEN HERE

1348
00:35:23,333 --> 00:35:24,767
THIS NINE MONTHS SAVING UP

1349
00:35:24,767 --> 00:35:26,533
FOR WHEN THE BABY WAS BORN

1350
00:35:26,533 --> 00:35:28,067
TO BE ABLE TO LIVE WHERE YOU

1351
00:35:28,067 --> 00:35:28,900
WANT TO LIVE.

1352
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,467
NOW YOU HAVE TO GO ALL THE WAY

1353
00:35:30,467 --> 00:35:32,067
TO A DIFFERENT STATE

1354
00:35:32,067 --> 00:35:33,067
AND YOU HAVE TO LIVE

1355
00:35:33,067 --> 00:35:33,733
OFF HIS DAD NOW.

1356
00:35:33,733 --> 00:35:34,667
LIKE, AREN'T YOU TIRED OF LIVING

1357
00:35:34,667 --> 00:35:35,333
OFF OF PEOPLE?

1358
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,933
>> YEAH, BELIEVE ME, I AM.

1359
00:35:36,933 --> 00:35:37,933
I'M GONNA TRY TO MAKE THE BEST

1360
00:35:37,933 --> 00:35:39,967
OF IT FOR HER.

1361
00:35:39,967 --> 00:35:40,900
>> ARE YOU GONNA MENTION TO YOUR

1362
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:41,700
PARENTS AT ALL THAT YOU'RE

1363
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,800
MOVING TO TEXAS?

1364
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,800
>> I--NO.

1365
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,867
I'M JUST NOT READY TO REALLY

1366
00:35:45,867 --> 00:35:46,867
FORGIVE THEM.

1367
00:35:46,867 --> 00:35:47,700
>> IF YOU GO TO TEXAS...

1368
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,533
>> MM-HMM.

1369
00:35:48,533 --> 00:35:49,533
>> AND YOU AND DEREK GET INTO

1370
00:35:49,533 --> 00:35:51,500
A FIGHT OR SOMETHING HAPPENS,

1371
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,633
IF YOU NEED SOMEONE TO GO TO,

1372
00:35:52,633 --> 00:35:53,633
THERE'S NO ONE TO GO TO THERE.

1373
00:35:53,633 --> 00:35:55,433
>> I KNOW.

1374
00:35:55,433 --> 00:35:56,433
>> YOU KNOW I'M ALWAYS HONEST

1375
00:35:56,433 --> 00:35:57,100
WITH YOU.

1376
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:57,900
I'M NOT GONNA LIE TO YOU.

1377
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:58,533
I LOVE YOU TO DEATH.

1378
00:35:58,533 --> 00:35:59,500
BUT YOU COULD'VE HAD EVERYTHING

1379
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,867
FOR YOU HERE.

1380
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:01,700
>> YEAH.

1381
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,200
>> DEREK COULD'VE HAD THE MONEY.

1382
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:04,067
YOU COULD'VE HAD

1383
00:36:04,067 --> 00:36:05,667
THE PICTURE-PERFECT FAMILY

1384
00:36:05,667 --> 00:36:06,533
YOU WANTED.

1385
00:36:06,533 --> 00:36:07,233
>> YEAH.

1386
00:36:07,233 --> 00:36:08,233
>> AND NOW YOU GOT TO BE

1387
00:36:08,233 --> 00:36:09,733
ALL MESSED UP.

1388
00:36:09,733 --> 00:36:10,633
AND HONESTLY,

1389
00:36:10,633 --> 00:36:11,967
I DON'T SEE HIM STEPPING UP.

1390
00:36:11,967 --> 00:36:13,700
I THINK YOU HAVE WAY TOO MUCH

1391
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:15,233
FAITH IN HIM AT THIS POINT...

1392
00:36:15,233 --> 00:36:16,067
>> YEAH.

1393
00:36:16,067 --> 00:36:16,867
>> WHEN HE'S NOT PROVING

1394
00:36:16,867 --> 00:36:17,667
ANYTHING.

1395
00:36:17,667 --> 00:36:20,233
>> * I'M NOT SURE *

1396
00:36:20,233 --> 00:36:23,100
* THIS MAGIC'S GONNA WORK *

1397
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,167
>> DON'T GO AWAY.

1398
00:36:29,167 --> 00:36:30,167
THIS EPISODE OF 16 AND PREGNANT 

1399
00:36:30,167 --> 00:36:31,767
CONTINUES RIGHT NOW.

1400
00:36:31,767 --> 00:36:32,767
>> * OH, LOVE

1401
00:36:32,767 --> 00:36:35,600
*

1402
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,600
* GET IN MY HEAD

1403
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,433
>> PUT THAT TONGUE AWAY.

1404
00:36:38,433 --> 00:36:40,100
>> * SET THE WORLD ON FIRE

1405
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,233
>> AFTER TALKING TO SUGAR,

1406
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:42,300
I NEED TO KNOW WHETHER DEREK

1407
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:43,533
IS REALLY GONNA BE THERE FOR US

1408
00:36:43,533 --> 00:36:45,467
IF WE MOVE TO TEXAS.

1409
00:36:45,467 --> 00:36:48,667
>> * COLOR ME RED

1410
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:49,667
*SET THE WORLD ON FIRE *

1411
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:51,333
>> SO I REALLY THINK THAT WE

1412
00:36:51,333 --> 00:36:52,733
NEED TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT

1413
00:36:52,733 --> 00:36:53,900
IF WE'RE REALLY GONNA MOVE

1414
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,733
TO TEXAS OR NOT.

1415
00:36:55,733 --> 00:36:57,867
>> WELL, DO YOU WANT TO GO?

1416
00:36:57,867 --> 00:36:59,133
>> I MEAN, IT'S NOT MY FIRST

1417
00:36:59,133 --> 00:37:00,800
CHOICE.

1418
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,633
>> WELL, WHAT'S YOUR FIRST

1419
00:37:01,633 --> 00:37:02,633
CHOICE?

1420
00:37:02,633 --> 00:37:05,067
>> LIVING HERE IN AN APARTMENT.

1421
00:37:05,067 --> 00:37:05,933
>> THAT'S NOT A CHOICE AT ALL.

1422
00:37:05,933 --> 00:37:06,933
THAT'S NOT EVEN AN OPTION.

1423
00:37:06,933 --> 00:37:07,933
>> WELL, WE ONLY HAVE REALLY

1424
00:37:07,933 --> 00:37:08,833
ONE OPTION.

1425
00:37:08,833 --> 00:37:10,600
IT FEELS LIKE NOW WE'RE BACK

1426
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,467
TO BOUNCING FROM HOUSE TO HOUSE.

1427
00:37:12,467 --> 00:37:14,067
>> THAT'S WHY WE SHOULD GO

1428
00:37:14,067 --> 00:37:16,467
TO TEXAS.

1429
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:17,467
BECAUSE THERE'S A HOME

1430
00:37:17,467 --> 00:37:19,333
THAT WE WOULD BE STAYING AT.

1431
00:37:19,333 --> 00:37:21,067
YOU'LL HAVE YOU'RE OWN ROOM,

1432
00:37:21,067 --> 00:37:22,700
WHICH YOU KEEP SAYING YOU WANT.

1433
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,600
IT'S DEFINITELY BETTER THAN

1434
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,600
STAYING HERE.

1435
00:37:24,600 --> 00:37:25,600
>> YEAH, WHEN I WAS TALKING

1436
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,700
TO SUGAR, SHE BROUGHT UP,

1437
00:37:26,700 --> 00:37:27,700
IF WE DON'T WORK OUT,

1438
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:28,700
OR WHATEVER,

1439
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,933
WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO.

1440
00:37:30,933 --> 00:37:32,067
>> THAT'S STUPID.

1441
00:37:32,067 --> 00:37:33,200
THAT'S 'CAUSE SHE'S NEGATIVE.

1442
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,167
SHE LIKES TO THINK ABOUT

1443
00:37:34,167 --> 00:37:35,067
ALL OF THE NEGATIVE THINGS

1444
00:37:35,067 --> 00:37:36,467
THAT COULD POSSIBLY HAPPEN.

1445
00:37:36,467 --> 00:37:38,133
>> I MEAN, YOU HAVE SAID BEFORE

1446
00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:39,333
THAT YOU CAN JUST REALLY LEAVE

1447
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:41,367
WHENEVER YOU WANT.

1448
00:37:41,367 --> 00:37:42,767
SO IF WE GO TO TEXAS,

1449
00:37:42,767 --> 00:37:43,833
HOW DO I KNOW YOU'RE NOT JUST

1450
00:37:43,833 --> 00:37:46,433
GONNA GO OUT OR DO STUFF

1451
00:37:46,433 --> 00:37:47,367
AND LEAVE?

1452
00:37:47,367 --> 00:37:48,967
>> AND MISS OUT ON THIS?

1453
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:49,833
THERE'S NOTHING I'D RATHER

1454
00:37:49,833 --> 00:37:50,600
BE DOING.

1455
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,833
>> IT JUST FEELS UNSTABLE.

1456
00:37:52,833 --> 00:37:55,333
>> EVERYWHERE WE GO IS UNSTABLE.

1457
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:57,067
WHERE HAVE WE BEEN IN THE LAST--

1458
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:58,067
WE HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN IN ONE

1459
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,067
PLACE FOR MORE THAN THREE

1460
00:37:59,067 --> 00:37:59,767
MONTHS.

1461
00:37:59,767 --> 00:38:02,067
YOU JUST HAVE TO BE PATIENT.

1462
00:38:02,067 --> 00:38:03,867
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN OVERNIGHT.

1463
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:05,067
>> I KNOW.

1464
00:38:05,067 --> 00:38:07,133
I MEAN, I WANT A GOOD SITUATION

1465
00:38:07,133 --> 00:38:08,267
FOR HER TO GROW UP IN.

1466
00:38:08,267 --> 00:38:09,767
I DON'T WANT HER TO BE BOUNCING

1467
00:38:09,767 --> 00:38:12,200
BACK AND FORTH LIKE I HAD TO.

1468
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,267
>> WE'LL JUST HAVE TO WORK

1469
00:38:13,267 --> 00:38:14,267
HARDER TO MAKE SURE THAT SHE

1470
00:38:14,267 --> 00:38:16,067
DOESN'T HAVE A--

1471
00:38:16,067 --> 00:38:17,933
HAVE TO GROW UP THE WAY WE DID.

1472
00:38:17,933 --> 00:38:18,933
>> YEAH.

1473
00:38:18,933 --> 00:38:21,600
>> I THINK THIS IS ONE BIG STEP

1474
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,367
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

1475
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,733
>> YEAH.

1476
00:38:25,733 --> 00:38:26,733
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1477
00:38:26,733 --> 00:38:29,067
YOU WANT TO GO TO TEXAS?

1478
00:38:29,067 --> 00:38:30,267
SHE SAID YES.

1479
00:38:30,267 --> 00:38:32,700
>> I THINK IT'S OUR ONLY OPTION.

1480
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,700
>> I THINK WE SHOULD GO.

1481
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:37,700
[humming]

1482
00:38:39,867 --> 00:38:40,867
>> BEFORE I GOT PREGNANT,

1483
00:38:40,867 --> 00:38:42,567
I WAS REALLY FUN AND OUTGOING

1484
00:38:42,567 --> 00:38:44,067
AND I HAD A LOT OF FRIENDS,

1485
00:38:44,067 --> 00:38:44,767
WENT TO PARTIES

1486
00:38:44,767 --> 00:38:47,100
AND DID TEENAGE STUFF.

1487
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,933
LITTLE PEANUT.

1488
00:38:48,933 --> 00:38:50,400
I DO NOT STILL FEEL LIKE

1489
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:51,267
A TEENAGER.

1490
00:38:51,267 --> 00:38:52,767
I FEEL LIKE I'M TEN YEARS OLDER

1491
00:38:52,767 --> 00:38:54,067
THAN WHAT I AM.

1492
00:38:54,067 --> 00:38:55,800
I--IT'S JUST WHAT I HAVE TO DO.

1493
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,067
>> * OH, SING

1494
00:38:57,067 --> 00:38:58,833
* SING MY SOUL

1495
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:00,333
>> I HAD A HOME.

1496
00:39:00,333 --> 00:39:01,600
I HAD NICE THINGS.

1497
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,300
I HAD A CAR.

1498
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:03,867
I HAD EVERYTHING I WANTED.

1499
00:39:03,867 --> 00:39:05,567
AND THEN IT WAS JUST GONE.

1500
00:39:05,567 --> 00:39:06,567
THAT IS ONE OF THE WORST

1501
00:39:06,567 --> 00:39:08,067
SITUATIONS THAT I CAN IMAGINE.

1502
00:39:08,067 --> 00:39:09,700
>> I TOLD YOU SHE POOPED.

1503
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,533
I'M NOT CHANGING IT.

1504
00:39:10,533 --> 00:39:12,067
>> OH, MY GOD.

1505
00:39:12,067 --> 00:39:13,067
I JUST PUT MY HAND IN POOP.

1506
00:39:13,067 --> 00:39:13,867
>> [laughs]

1507
00:39:13,867 --> 00:39:14,900
>> DEREK IS VERY CAREFREE,

1508
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,867
AND THAT'S VERY FRUSTRATING

1509
00:39:15,867 --> 00:39:17,400
'CAUSE I NEED HIM TO STEP UP

1510
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,067
TO THE PLATE AND TAKE

1511
00:39:19,067 --> 00:39:20,167
RESPONSIBILITY.

1512
00:39:20,167 --> 00:39:21,333
[baby cries]

1513
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:23,500
I WORRY THAT HE IS NOT GONNA

1514
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,500
PURSUE AN ACTUAL CAREER

1515
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,667
AND IS NOT GONNA SAVE MONEY.

1516
00:39:27,667 --> 00:39:28,633
IT SCARES ME MORE NOW

1517
00:39:28,633 --> 00:39:30,733
BECAUSE GENEVIEVE IS ACTUALLY

1518
00:39:30,733 --> 00:39:32,067
HERE, SO SHE'S GONNA NEED

1519
00:39:32,067 --> 00:39:34,867
MORE THINGS, AND WE HAVE NO

1520
00:39:34,867 --> 00:39:37,067
MONEY TO GET HER THOSE THINGS.

1521
00:39:37,067 --> 00:39:37,833
>> WE GOT TO PUT OUR CLOTHES

1522
00:39:37,833 --> 00:39:38,833
IN HERE.

1523
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:40,167
WE DON'T HAVE ANY SUITCASES.

1524
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:42,367
IT'S A LEAP OF FAITH TO JUST

1525
00:39:42,367 --> 00:39:43,433
PACK UP EVERYTHING AND MOVE

1526
00:39:43,433 --> 00:39:44,367
TO TEXAS WITH DEREK,

1527
00:39:44,367 --> 00:39:45,600
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW ANYONE ELSE

1528
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,567
OTHER THAN HIM AND HIS DAD.

1529
00:39:47,567 --> 00:39:49,367
BYE, MARYLAND.

1530
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:50,433
FOR US AND OUR FAMILY,

1531
00:39:50,433 --> 00:39:52,667
IT'S JUST BETTER FOR US TO GO.

1532
00:39:52,667 --> 00:39:54,067
SO I CAN'T REALLY THINK ABOUT

1533
00:39:54,067 --> 00:39:55,200
BEING SAD ABOUT LEAVING.

1534
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:58,867
>> * OH, OH

1535
00:39:58,867 --> 00:40:00,733
* WHEN I COME BACK

1536
00:40:00,733 --> 00:40:01,467
* COME BACK

1537
00:40:01,467 --> 00:40:02,633
>> I DO NOT REGRET GENEVIEVE,

1538
00:40:02,633 --> 00:40:05,033
BUT I DO REGRET HAVING HER

1539
00:40:05,033 --> 00:40:06,167
AT SUCH A YOUNG AGE.

1540
00:40:06,167 --> 00:40:07,733
I REGRET BEING STUPID.

1541
00:40:07,733 --> 00:40:09,000
USE PROTECTION.

1542
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:09,767
BIRTH CONTROL.

1543
00:40:09,767 --> 00:40:11,267
DO WHATEVER YOU CAN SO YOU DO

1544
00:40:11,267 --> 00:40:12,767
NOT GET PREGNANT.

1545
00:40:12,767 --> 00:40:13,767
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

1546
00:40:13,767 --> 00:40:14,700
WE'LL KEEP IN TOUCH.

1547
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:15,667
>> OKAY.

1548
00:40:15,667 --> 00:40:16,567
>> NOBODY THINKS THAT'S GONNA

1549
00:40:16,567 --> 00:40:17,233
HAPPEN.

1550
00:40:17,233 --> 00:40:18,233
I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS GONNA

1551
00:40:18,233 --> 00:40:19,233
HAPPEN TO ME,

1552
00:40:19,233 --> 00:40:20,233
BUT THEN I WAS PREGNANT

1553
00:40:20,233 --> 00:40:21,400
WHILE BEING HOMELESS.

1554
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:23,033
>> * OH, SING

1555
00:40:23,033 --> 00:40:24,267
* SING MY SOUL

1556
00:40:24,267 --> 00:40:25,500
>> I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT

1557
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,167
THE FUTURE HOLDS FOR MYSELF

1558
00:40:27,167 --> 00:40:28,800
AND GENEVIEVE AND DEREK.

1559
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,800
>> * OH, SING

1560
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:32,267
*OH, SING MY SOUL *

1561
00:40:32,267 --> 00:40:35,100
* AS ALL THE YEARS FORETOLD

1562
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:36,233
* TO HEAR

1563
00:40:36,233 --> 00:40:38,533
* THE RINGS THAT CHANGE

1564
00:40:38,533 --> 00:40:39,533
* AND, OH, SING

1565
00:40:39,533 --> 00:40:41,900
* OH, SING MY SOUL

1566
00:40:48,633 --> 00:40:49,700
>> SINCE YOU'RE NOT THE FATHER,

1567
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,700
I DON'T THINK YOU GUYS WILL

1568
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,533
LAST.

1569
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:52,533
>> IT'S REALLY AWKWARD FOR ME

1570
00:40:52,533 --> 00:40:53,533
BEING PREGNANT WITH SOMEBODY

1571
00:40:53,533 --> 00:40:54,967
ELSE'S BABY.

1572
00:40:54,967 --> 00:40:55,967
I HATE SEX.

1573
00:40:55,967 --> 00:40:57,267
THAT'S JUST WHAT HAPPENS.

1574
00:40:57,267 --> 00:40:58,267
>> YOU AND MAUWI AIN'T NEVER

1575
00:40:58,267 --> 00:40:59,267
EVEN BEEN INTIMATE, RIGHT?

1576
00:40:59,267 --> 00:41:00,067
>> RIGHT.

1577
00:41:00,067 --> 00:41:01,067
I'M PUTTING ON A CHASTITY BELT.

1578
00:41:01,067 --> 00:41:02,067
>> THAT'S EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING,

1579
00:41:02,067 --> 00:41:03,067
'CAUSE NOBODY TOLD YOU

1580
00:41:03,067 --> 00:41:05,067
YOU WOULD POP UP PREGNANT.
