1
00:00:03,003 --> 00:00:05,973
>> MY NAME IS DANIELLE.

2
00:00:05,973 --> 00:00:06,974
I'M TIRED OF DOING THAT.

3
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:08,076
MY ARM HURTS.

4
00:00:08,076 --> 00:00:10,078
I'M 16 YEARS OLD, AND I LIVE

5
00:00:10,078 --> 00:00:11,879
WITH MY MOM, STEPDAD,

6
00:00:11,879 --> 00:00:13,247
TWO SISTERS, AND BROTHER

7
00:00:13,247 --> 00:00:14,415
IN THE SUBURBS OF COLUMBUS,

8
00:00:14,415 --> 00:00:15,483
OHIO.

9
00:00:15,483 --> 00:00:16,984
AS A KID, SCHOOL WAS REALLY

10
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:18,652
IMPORTANT TO ME, BECAUSE I

11
00:00:18,652 --> 00:00:19,553
WANTED TO GROW UP TO BE

12
00:00:19,553 --> 00:00:20,521
A LAWYER.

13
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:21,855
BUT THAT ALL CHANGED IN MY

14
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,357
FRESHMAN YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL.

15
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:24,292
I STARTED HANGING OUT WITH

16
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:25,526
A PARTY CROWD, AND THINGS GOT

17
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:27,195
PRETTY WILD.

18
00:00:27,195 --> 00:00:28,196
I SKIPPED SCHOOL.

19
00:00:28,196 --> 00:00:29,530
I FAILED CLASSES.

20
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,199
I WAS OUT ALL THE TIME,

21
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:32,200
AND MY MOM AND I FOUGHT

22
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,367
CONSTANTLY.

23
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,668
MY GRANDMA THOUGHT SHE COULD

24
00:00:34,668 --> 00:00:35,636
STRAIGHTEN ME OUT...

25
00:00:35,636 --> 00:00:37,138
>> I THINK IT'S TIME DANIELLE

26
00:00:37,138 --> 00:00:38,706
CAME AND LIVED WITH ME.

27
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:39,873
>> GOOD LUCK.

28
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:41,342
>> SO SHE TOOK ME TO LIVE WITH

29
00:00:41,342 --> 00:00:43,010
HER 45 MINUTES AWAY.

30
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,512
THAT'S WHERE I MET MY BOYFRIEND,

31
00:00:44,512 --> 00:00:45,179
JAMIE.

32
00:00:45,179 --> 00:00:45,946
BYE, I LOVE YOU.

33
00:00:45,946 --> 00:00:46,547
>> BYE.

34
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:47,648
>> WE HAD AN INSTANT CONNECTION

35
00:00:47,648 --> 00:00:48,349
WHEN WE MET.

36
00:00:48,349 --> 00:00:49,250
HE HAS A JOB WORKING AT

37
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,684
A FAST-FOOD PLACE.

38
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:52,019
LUCKILY, IT'S NEAR HIS HOUSE,

39
00:00:52,019 --> 00:00:53,521
BECAUSE HE LOST HIS LICENSE,

40
00:00:53,521 --> 00:00:54,688
AND WE BOTH HAVE TO RELY

41
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:56,690
ON OUR PARENTS TO GET AROUND.

42
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,359
NOW MY MOM IS MAKING ME MOVE

43
00:00:58,359 --> 00:00:59,693
BACK IN WITH HER.

44
00:00:59,693 --> 00:01:01,195
AND SHE REGRETS EVER LETTING ME

45
00:01:01,195 --> 00:01:02,730
MOVE TO MY GRANDMA'S,

46
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:05,133
BECAUSE I'M PREGNANT.

47
00:01:15,376 --> 00:01:17,044
EVEN THOUGH MY MOM MADE ME MOVE

48
00:01:17,044 --> 00:01:18,712
BACK IN WITH HER, I STILL SPEND

49
00:01:18,712 --> 00:01:20,381
AS MUCH TIME AS I CAN HANGING

50
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:21,449
OUT AT JAMIE'S HOUSE.

51
00:01:21,449 --> 00:01:22,116
>> MORNING.

52
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:23,117
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

53
00:01:23,117 --> 00:01:24,452
>> MAKING YOU BREAKFAST.

54
00:01:24,452 --> 00:01:25,486
>> OH, DO YOU REALIZE THAT

55
00:01:25,486 --> 00:01:26,654
YOU COOK EVERYTHING FOR ME?

56
00:01:26,654 --> 00:01:28,156
THAT I NEVER COOK ANYTHING?

57
00:01:28,156 --> 00:01:29,157
I WISH I COULD COOK.

58
00:01:29,157 --> 00:01:31,325
I NEVER REALLY HAD TO LEARN.

59
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:32,326
>> I MEAN, YOU GOT TO LEARN

60
00:01:32,326 --> 00:01:33,227
A LOT.

61
00:01:33,227 --> 00:01:34,228
IT'S, LIKE...

62
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:35,863
>> I KNOW I HAVE A LOT TO LEARN.

63
00:01:35,863 --> 00:01:36,797
BUT I NEVER REALLY THOUGHT

64
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:37,698
I WOULD HAVE TO LEARN IT

65
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:39,700
THAT QUICK.

66
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:40,701
BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO LIVE

67
00:01:40,701 --> 00:01:42,035
WITH OUR PARENTS ONCE THE BABY

68
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:43,371
COMES, WE'RE PLANNING ON GETTING

69
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:46,039
OUR OWN PLACE SOON.

70
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,875
I'M DUE IN TWO MONTHS.

71
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:49,076
WE'RE HAVING A BOY, AND WE'VE

72
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:50,911
ALREADY DECIDED ON A NAME.

73
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:51,879
CAN YOU BELIEVE YOU'RE GONNA

74
00:01:51,879 --> 00:01:52,946
HAVE A BABY NAMED AFTER YOU?

75
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,282
>> YEAH.

76
00:01:54,282 --> 00:01:55,683
>> JAMIE JUNIOR.

77
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:58,319
>> CRAZY. JUNIOR.

78
00:01:58,319 --> 00:01:59,420
>> LIKE, YOU'RE GONNA BE CALLED

79
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,020
"DAD."

80
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:00,921
LIKE, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE

81
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:01,889
A LITTLE KID RUNNING AROUND

82
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:02,690
CALLING YOU "DAD."

83
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,192
>> THAT'S CRAZY.

84
00:02:04,192 --> 00:02:05,359
>> I KNOW.

85
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,694
EVERY TIME I TALK TO MY MOM

86
00:02:06,694 --> 00:02:08,729
ABOUT IT, SHE, LIKE, WANNA CRY.

87
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:10,398
>> WHY?

88
00:02:10,398 --> 00:02:11,332
>> 'CAUSE WE WEREN'T EVEN

89
00:02:11,332 --> 00:02:12,266
TOGETHER FOR A YEAR BEFORE

90
00:02:12,266 --> 00:02:13,301
WE HAD A BABY.

91
00:02:13,301 --> 00:02:14,235
>> THAT'S KIND OF CRAZY.

92
00:02:14,235 --> 00:02:15,135
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A BABY

93
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,670
BEFORE OUR ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY.

94
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,505
>> I KNOW.

95
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:19,840
WHEN I MET YOU, I THINK YOUR

96
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,176
ATTITUDE, LIKE, ATTRACTED ME

97
00:02:22,176 --> 00:02:22,943
TO YOU.

98
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:24,278
>> WHAT KIND OF ATTITUDE

99
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:24,945
DID I HAVE?

100
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:25,713
>> I DON'T KNOW.

101
00:02:25,713 --> 00:02:26,580
YOU HAD THAT KIND OF,

102
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,182
"I DON'T CARE" ATTITUDE.

103
00:02:28,182 --> 00:02:29,217
>> I'M GOOD ENOUGH FOR MYSELF.

104
00:02:29,217 --> 00:02:30,184
>> YEAH.

105
00:02:30,184 --> 00:02:31,719
>> YEAH. FOR SURE.

106
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:32,720
YOU HAD THE SAME ATTITUDE,

107
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:33,387
THOUGH.

108
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:34,722
YOU UNDERSTOOD, LIKE,

109
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:35,889
WHAT I WAS TALKING ABOUT,

110
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:36,924
AND I COULD HAVE AN ACTUAL

111
00:02:36,924 --> 00:02:37,925
CONVERSATION WITH YOU

112
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:38,926
WITHOUT YOU SAYING SOMETHING

113
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:40,127
THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO

114
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:41,295
WITH WHAT WE WAS TALKING ABOUT.

115
00:02:41,295 --> 00:02:42,630
>> WE HAD GOOD CONVO.

116
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,797
>> YEAH.

117
00:02:43,797 --> 00:02:45,132
>> SINCE JAMIE LEFT HIGH SCHOOL

118
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:46,634
AND HAS NO PLANS TO RETURN

119
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:48,135
RIGHT AWAY, IT'S REALLY

120
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:49,370
IMPORTANT TO BOTH OF US

121
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,038
THAT I GO ON TO GRADUATE.

122
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:52,873
SO I'M DOING HOMESCHOOL ONLINE,

123
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,875
BUT IT GETS PRETTY LONELY,

124
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,710
AND I REALLY MISS MY FRIENDS.

125
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,878
>> I WAS HAVING BIOLOGY

126
00:02:57,878 --> 00:02:59,213
FLASHBACKS THE OTHER DAY.

127
00:02:59,213 --> 00:03:01,081
LIKE, I MISS MS. SPENCER'S

128
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:02,149
CLASS.

129
00:03:02,149 --> 00:03:02,883
>> OH, MY GOSH.

130
00:03:02,883 --> 00:03:04,485
SHE [bleep] HATED ME.

131
00:03:04,485 --> 00:03:05,953
I FAILED AT THE BEGINNING.

132
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:06,787
[laughter]

133
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:07,721
I WAS IN WEEK ONE,

134
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,056
AND I WAS FAILING IT.

135
00:03:09,056 --> 00:03:10,224
>> AFTER YOU HAVE THE BABY,

136
00:03:10,224 --> 00:03:11,725
ARE YOU COMING BACK TO SCHOOL,

137
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:12,560
OR ARE YOU GONNA BE

138
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,461
HOMESCHOOLED?

139
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:14,228
>> I DON'T KNOW.

140
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:15,128
I WANT TO GO BACK FOR MY

141
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,029
12TH-GRADE YEAR, THOUGH.

142
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:16,964
I DO KNOW THAT.

143
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:18,131
>> YEAH, YOUR SENIOR YEAR

144
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:19,633
IS NOT AS CRACKED UP AS IT'S

145
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:20,601
SUPPOSED TO BE.

146
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:21,435
>> THAT'S JUST YOU.

147
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:23,203
>> I BET IT WOULD BE FOR ME.

148
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,071
IF I HAVE A GOOD BODY,

149
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:25,239
I'M GONNA BE THE PAINTED PEOPLE

150
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:26,240
AT THE FOOTBALL GAME.

151
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,076
[laughter]

152
00:03:29,076 --> 00:03:30,077
>> WHAT DO YOU, LIKE, MISS

153
00:03:30,077 --> 00:03:31,078
ABOUT SCHOOL?

154
00:03:31,078 --> 00:03:32,246
>> LIKE, EVERYTHING,

155
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:33,247
JUST BEING ABLE TO BE AROUND

156
00:03:33,247 --> 00:03:34,748
MY FRIENDS ALL DAY, LIKE,

157
00:03:34,748 --> 00:03:36,183
EVERY DAY, AND NOW I DON'T EVER

158
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:38,051
GET TO BE AROUND THEM.

159
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,553
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

160
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:40,654
I WOULD GO BACK IN A HEARTBEAT,

161
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:41,255
THOUGH.

162
00:03:41,255 --> 00:03:42,155
I KNOW THAT.

163
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,023
>> SO WERE YOU TAKING

164
00:03:43,023 --> 00:03:44,157
YOUR BIRTH CONTROL?

165
00:03:44,157 --> 00:03:44,958
>> NO.

166
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,294
NO.

167
00:03:46,294 --> 00:03:47,295
WE DIDN'T HAVE NO PROTECTION

168
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:48,095
OR NOTHING.

169
00:03:48,095 --> 00:03:49,463
I WENT TO THE CLINIC TO GET

170
00:03:49,463 --> 00:03:51,665
BIRTH CONTROL, TO ORDER MY

171
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:52,833
BIRTH CONTROL, AND THEY TELL

172
00:03:52,833 --> 00:03:54,802
YOU--THEY MAKE YOU PEE IN A CUP

173
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:55,836
TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT

174
00:03:55,836 --> 00:03:56,870
BEFORE THEY GIVE YOU IT,

175
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,472
AND I PEED IN THE CUP

176
00:03:58,472 --> 00:03:59,239
AND EVERYTHING.

177
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,173
THEY TOLD ME, "YOU'RE NOT

178
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:01,241
PREGNANT."

179
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,576
I ORDERED MY BIRTH CONTROL

180
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,244
AND THEN WENT BACK A WEEK LATER

181
00:04:04,244 --> 00:04:05,413
TO PICK UP MY BIRTH CONTROL,

182
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:06,947
PEED IN A CUP AGAIN,

183
00:04:06,947 --> 00:04:08,949
AND ENDED UP BEING PREGNANT.

184
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:09,783
>> OH, MY GOODNESS.

185
00:04:09,783 --> 00:04:11,118
SO THAT TEST--WAIT, HOLD ON.

186
00:04:11,118 --> 00:04:12,820
SO YOU TOOK A TEST BEFORE,

187
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,987
AND IT SAID YOU WEREN'T PREGNANT

188
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:14,888
WHILE YOU WERE PREGNANT.

189
00:04:14,888 --> 00:04:15,856
>> YEAH, WELL, IT TAKE YOU--

190
00:04:15,856 --> 00:04:17,157
IT TAKE A LITTLE BIT FOR

191
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:18,158
IT TO ACTUALLY SHOW THAT

192
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,159
YOU'RE PREGNANT.

193
00:04:19,159 --> 00:04:19,927
>> YEAH.

194
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:21,929
WAS THAT WHEN YOU TOLD YOUR MOM?

195
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,597
>> YEAH, SHE CRIED.

196
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:24,932
YEAH, IT WAS AN EMOTIONAL

197
00:04:24,932 --> 00:04:26,600
MOMENT.

198
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,769
MY MOM HAD ME WHEN SHE WAS 16,

199
00:04:28,769 --> 00:04:30,270
AND IT WAS ROUGH ON HER.

200
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,939
SHE TOLD ME OVER AND OVER AGAIN

201
00:04:31,939 --> 00:04:33,441
HOW TO AVOID GETTING PREGNANT,

202
00:04:33,441 --> 00:04:34,775
BECAUSE THE LAST THING SHE

203
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,109
WANTED WAS FOR ME TO MAKE

204
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,611
THE SAME MISTAKE.

205
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,612
AND SHE'S STILL HAVING A HARD

206
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,614
TIME ACCEPTING THAT I'M HAVING

207
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:41,449
A BABY.

208
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:42,249
>> DO YOU KNOW WHY

209
00:04:42,249 --> 00:04:44,284
I WAS SO STRICT?

210
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,185
>> YEAH.

211
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:46,019
>> NOW?

212
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:46,920
>> I MEAN, I'VE KNOWN--

213
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,021
I KNEW WHY YOU WERE,

214
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:49,523
BUT I DIDN'T CARE.

215
00:04:49,523 --> 00:04:50,858
>> YOU KNOW HOW BAD IT BREAKS

216
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:53,527
MY HEART TO KNOW THAT I LET YOU

217
00:04:53,527 --> 00:04:55,363
GO LIVE WITH GRANDMA

218
00:04:55,363 --> 00:04:58,165
AND ALL THIS HAPPENED?

219
00:05:05,439 --> 00:05:08,208
SERIOUSLY?

220
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,710
AND WHAT WERE MY WORDS

221
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,379
THE DAY THAT GRANDMA CALLED ME

222
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:13,046
AND SAID, "MAYBE SHE SHOULD

223
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:14,382
COME HERE AND STAY

224
00:05:14,382 --> 00:05:16,116
AND TRY SCHOOL HERE"?

225
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:18,586
WHAT WERE MY WORDS?

226
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:19,252
"WHY?

227
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,187
SO SHE CAN END UP PREGNANT

228
00:05:20,187 --> 00:05:21,422
LIKE I DID?"

229
00:05:21,422 --> 00:05:23,424
BECAUSE I KNEW WHAT MY LIFE

230
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:25,125
WAS THERE.

231
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,293
THERE WAS NO PARENTAL

232
00:05:26,293 --> 00:05:28,128
SUPERVISION, AND IT'S LIKE

233
00:05:28,128 --> 00:05:30,431
I LET MY BABY GIRL

234
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:31,765
OUT OF MY HANDS.

235
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:35,603
AND NOW WHEN PEOPLE LOOK AT ME,

236
00:05:35,603 --> 00:05:38,939
THEY THINK THAT I'M THIS

237
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:40,273
HORRIBLE PERSON, BECAUSE

238
00:05:40,273 --> 00:05:42,275
I HAVE A 16-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER

239
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:43,611
WHO'S PREGNANT, WHICH I WORKED

240
00:05:43,611 --> 00:05:45,446
SO HARD TO EMBED IT IN YOUR HEAD

241
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:47,615
THAT THIS ISN'T SOMETHING

242
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:49,783
THAT YOU WANTED.

243
00:06:10,438 --> 00:06:11,605
>> BE CAREFUL, OKAY?

244
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:12,272
>> OKAY.

245
00:06:12,272 --> 00:06:13,907
>> STAY AWAY FROM THE CARNIES.

246
00:06:13,907 --> 00:06:14,808
>> IT'S HARD FOR MY MOM

247
00:06:14,808 --> 00:06:16,376
TO ACCEPT MY PREGNANCY,

248
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:17,277
BUT SHE'S DOING THE BEST

249
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:19,112
SHE CAN.

250
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,180
HELLO!

251
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,849
AND NOW THAT I'M TAKING CLASSES

252
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:24,017
ONLINE, IT TAKES A LOT OF EFFORT

253
00:06:24,017 --> 00:06:25,185
TO HANG OUT WITH MY FRIENDS...

254
00:06:25,185 --> 00:06:26,854
>> OH, I MISSED YOU.

255
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,188
>> ESPECIALLY AT EIGHT-MONTHS

256
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:29,022
PREGNANT.

257
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:30,991
I WANT TO PLAY A GAME.

258
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:31,825
>> WELL, PLAY ONE.

259
00:06:31,825 --> 00:06:33,661
>> DO YOU KNOW THAT I'M--

260
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:35,162
RIGHT WHEN I'M LEGAL TO DRINK,

261
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:36,163
HE'LL BE ALREADY IN

262
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:37,197
KINDERGARTEN?

263
00:06:37,197 --> 00:06:38,031
>> THAT'S WEIRD.

264
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:39,099
>> CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

265
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:39,933
>> THAT'S WEIRD.

266
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:40,834
>> ACTUALLY, HE'LL BE IN

267
00:06:40,834 --> 00:06:41,869
KINDERGARTEN BEFORE I CAN EVEN

268
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:42,836
DRINK.

269
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,672
>> WELL, WHEN YOU TURN 21,

270
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:46,006
WE'RE GETTING A BABYSITTER.

271
00:06:46,006 --> 00:06:46,874
[laughter]

272
00:06:46,874 --> 00:06:48,709
WE'RE GOING OUT, BECAUSE IT'S

273
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:50,077
SERIOUS.

274
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,078
I THINK IT'S WEIRD WE'RE NOT

275
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:52,245
GOING TO THE SAME SCHOOL

276
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:52,913
THIS YEAR.

277
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:53,914
>> I KNOW.

278
00:06:53,914 --> 00:06:55,082
>> WE ALWAYS USED TO SKIP CLASS

279
00:06:55,082 --> 00:06:55,749
TOGETHER.

280
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:57,084
>> [laughing] I KNOW.

281
00:06:57,084 --> 00:06:58,251
WE DID EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

282
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,086
>> ALWAYS.

283
00:06:59,086 --> 00:06:59,953
>> REMEMBER, WE WERE,

284
00:06:59,953 --> 00:07:00,788
LIKE, THAT.

285
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:01,622
>> INSEPARABLE.

286
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:02,490
>> both: I KNOW.

287
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,390
>> HOPEFULLY, I CAN GET

288
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,492
CAUGHT UP.

289
00:07:04,492 --> 00:07:05,493
LIKE, I'M REALLY BEHIND.

290
00:07:05,493 --> 00:07:06,994
I DIDN'T GET, LIKE, ANY CREDIT,

291
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:07,661
NOT ONE.

292
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:08,462
>> YEAH, WHAT GRADE

293
00:07:08,462 --> 00:07:09,296
ARE YOU GONNA BE IN?

294
00:07:09,296 --> 00:07:10,197
>> LIKE, 10 1/2.

295
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:11,732
I'LL BE, LIKE, A 10 1/2 GRADER.

296
00:07:11,732 --> 00:07:12,766
>> YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T DO,

297
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:13,934
LIKE, ANY SCHOOL.

298
00:07:13,934 --> 00:07:15,603
LIKE, YOU WERE NEVER AT SCHOOL.

299
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:16,504
>> NO, I GOT IN TROUBLE

300
00:07:16,504 --> 00:07:17,237
ALL THE TIME.

301
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:18,005
>> ALL THE TIME.

302
00:07:18,005 --> 00:07:18,972
>> LIKE, ALL THE TIME.

303
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:19,973
CAN YOU BELIEVE I'M GONNA HAVE

304
00:07:19,973 --> 00:07:20,608
A BABY?

305
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:21,509
>> I CAN'T EVEN, LIKE--

306
00:07:21,509 --> 00:07:23,076
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SAY.

307
00:07:23,076 --> 00:07:23,777
>> YEAH.

308
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:24,778
>> THAT'S JUST WEIRD.

309
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,113
>> YEAH.

310
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:27,948
WERE YOU SHOCKED THAT I WAS

311
00:07:27,948 --> 00:07:28,782
HAVING A BABY?

312
00:07:28,782 --> 00:07:29,583
>> YES, BECAUSE--

313
00:07:29,583 --> 00:07:30,518
>> DID YOU THINK THEN THAT

314
00:07:30,518 --> 00:07:31,485
I WOULD BE READY FOR A BABY,

315
00:07:31,485 --> 00:07:32,085
THOUGH?

316
00:07:32,085 --> 00:07:32,686
>> NO.

317
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:33,420
>> YOU DIDN'T?

318
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,087
ME NEITHER.

319
00:07:34,087 --> 00:07:35,188
>> I DIDN'T THINK THAT YOU WERE

320
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,189
READY THEN BECAUSE OF ALL THE

321
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,090
PARTYING THAT I REMEMBER

322
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,458
YOU DOING AND US DOING.

323
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,426
>> I'M, LIKE, DIFFERENT NOW.

324
00:07:39,426 --> 00:07:40,494
>> THE ONLY REASON WHY IT REALLY

325
00:07:40,494 --> 00:07:42,129
SHOCKED ME WAS BECAUSE IT WAS

326
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,797
JAMIE, YOU KNOW?

327
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,298
BECAUSE, LIKE, YOU GUYS WEREN'T

328
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,299
EVEN TOGETHER THAT LONG.

329
00:07:46,299 --> 00:07:47,801
>> FOR NOT EVEN THAT LONG.

330
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:49,002
WE GOT TOGETHER IN OCTOBER.

331
00:07:49,002 --> 00:07:50,738
I WAS PREGNANT BY JANUARY.

332
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:51,905
>> THAT'S CRAZY.

333
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:52,573
>> YEAH.

334
00:07:52,573 --> 00:07:53,774
>> IT REALLY IS.

335
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:54,742
>> ME AND JAMIE WOULDN'T BE

336
00:07:54,742 --> 00:07:55,743
TOGETHER, THOUGH, IF I DIDN'T

337
00:07:55,743 --> 00:07:57,177
GET PREGNANT.

338
00:07:57,177 --> 00:07:58,478
WE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN.

339
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,412
I DIDN'T REALLY CARE ABOUT

340
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:00,914
OUR FUTURE, NOTHING LIKE THAT.

341
00:08:00,914 --> 00:08:02,449
BUT AFTER I GOT PREGNANT,

342
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:03,784
IT, LIKE, CHANGED HOW I LOOKED

343
00:08:03,784 --> 00:08:04,785
AT LIFE.

344
00:08:04,785 --> 00:08:08,055
LIKE, NOW I, LIKE, NEED HIM.

345
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:10,223
WITH JAMIE'S SUPPORT,

346
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:11,391
IT'LL BE A LOT EASIER

347
00:08:11,391 --> 00:08:12,760
TO KEEP UP IN SCHOOL.

348
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:13,927
AND AS DIFFICULT AS MY

349
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:15,763
SITUATION IS FOR MY MOM,

350
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:17,097
I'M GRATEFUL THAT SHE'S TRYING

351
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,666
TO BE THERE FOR ME TOO.

352
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:19,499
"PARTY IN MY CRIB.

353
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,668
YOU BRING THE BOTTLE."

354
00:08:20,668 --> 00:08:21,501
[scoffs]

355
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,670
>> NO WAY.

356
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:24,104
>> OH, MY GOSH.

357
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:25,639
IS THAT A DIAPER GENIE?

358
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,207
ZIP!

359
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:28,542
>> IT'S GONNA BE EXPENSIVE

360
00:08:28,542 --> 00:08:30,544
TO DRESS THIS BABY.

361
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:32,713
THIS STUFF ISN'T CHEAP, IS IT?

362
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:33,947
>> MM-MM.

363
00:08:33,947 --> 00:08:36,149
NOT AT ALL, ACTUALLY.

364
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:37,317
>> I THINK WE SHOULD JUST TURN

365
00:08:37,317 --> 00:08:38,485
THE FRONT PART OF OUR HOUSE

366
00:08:38,485 --> 00:08:40,153
INTO AN APARTMENT.

367
00:08:40,153 --> 00:08:40,988
>> I DON'T WANT TO--

368
00:08:40,988 --> 00:08:41,922
I DON'T WANT TO LIVE WITH

369
00:08:41,922 --> 00:08:42,690
MY MOM, THOUGH.

370
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,657
I WANT TO BE OUT ON MY OWN,

371
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:46,459
BE OUT--MAKE IT A FAMILY THING.

372
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:47,961
HOW MUCH DO YOU THINK I WOULD,

373
00:08:47,961 --> 00:08:49,529
LIKE, NEED FOR, LIKE, EVERYTHING

374
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,765
THAT I NEED TO GET?

375
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:53,266
>> PROBABLY $300 OR $400 A MONTH

376
00:08:53,266 --> 00:08:54,134
JUST FOR THE BABY.

377
00:08:54,134 --> 00:08:55,268

I'M JUST SAYING, LIKE,

I GOT A JOB OUT THERE,

534
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,894
AND US NOT BEING AROUND

535
00:12:40,894 --> 00:12:42,062
EACH OTHER, IT'S JUST MAKING

536
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:43,730
A REAL DISTANT FEELING.

537
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:44,764
>> MM-HMM.

538
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:45,732
>> AND I MEAN, NO ONE WANTS

539
00:12:45,732 --> 00:12:46,834
TO FEEL DISTANT FROM THE PERSON

540
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:47,700
THEY'RE ABOUT TO HAVE

541
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:48,368
A KID WITH.

542
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:49,269
I DON'T HAVE MY LICENSE,

543
00:12:49,269 --> 00:12:50,270
SO IT'S NOT LIKE I COULD JUST

544
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,338
COME OUT HERE AND VISIT FOR

545
00:12:51,338 --> 00:12:53,006
A COUPLE HOURS AND GO BACK HOME,

546
00:12:53,006 --> 00:12:54,041
SO...

547
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:55,008
>> I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK

548
00:12:55,008 --> 00:12:56,009
THAT I'M NOT GONNA BE AROUND.

549
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:57,510
LIKE, I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK

550
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,846
I'M NEVER GONNA BE UP HERE.

551
00:12:58,846 --> 00:13:00,047
>> IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T FEEL

552
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:02,249
COMFORTABLE WITH YOU OVER THERE.

553
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:04,818
I FEEL LIKE I'M MAKING

554
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:05,986
BAD CHOICES AS A PARENT

555
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:07,855
BY LETTING YOU.

556
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:10,023
A MOTHER LETTING HER DAUGHTER

557
00:13:10,023 --> 00:13:11,324
LIVE WITH HER BOYFRIEND

558
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:14,995
PRETTY MUCH WOULD MAKE ME

559
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:16,663
A PIECE OF [bleep] MOM.

560
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:17,330
>> NO.

561
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:18,832
>> AND THAT'S HOW I FEEL.

562
00:13:18,832 --> 00:13:19,732

YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO BE

582
00:13:42,089 --> 00:13:42,856
AWAY FROM HIM.

583
00:13:42,856 --> 00:13:44,691
SO RIGHT NOW, IF SHE HAS TO STAY

584
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:45,859
UP HERE, AND YOU GUYS MAKE HER

585
00:13:45,859 --> 00:13:46,894
STAY UP HERE, THERE'S NOTHING

586
00:13:46,894 --> 00:13:47,660
REALLY I CAN DO.

587
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:48,661
BUT WHEN HE COMES, I MEAN,

588
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,998
WE'RE ALL GONNA BE FACED

589
00:13:50,998 --> 00:13:51,999
WITH THIS SITUATION,

590
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,000
AND I'M REALLY NOT GONNA WANT

591

AND ONLY SOME OF US CAN HAVE

595
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:03,610

596
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,311
>> QUIT, MOM.

I COULD HAVE THE BABY ANY DAY,

604
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:23,796
SO I'M STAYING AT MY MOM'S

605
00:14:23,796 --> 00:14:24,797

AS MY DUE DATE COMES CLOSER,

608
00:14:27,467 --> 00:14:28,969
I'VE BEEN CRAVING JUST ABOUT

MY DAD'S OUT THERE WAITING.

939
00:22:52,472 --> 00:22:53,806
>> I KNOW JAMIE IS STRESSED

940
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:54,807
BECAUSE HE MISSED A COUPLE

941
00:22:54,807 --> 00:22:55,808
SHIFTS WHILE I WAS IN

942
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:57,477
THE HOSPITAL, AND NOW HE HAS TO

943
00:22:57,477 --> 00:22:59,779
GO TALK TO HIS BOSS.

944
00:23:10,156 --> 00:23:11,991
HEY, MAMA.

945
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:12,825
>> HOW YOU DOING?

946
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:14,326
>> AW, DID YOU MAKE THEM?

947
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:14,994
>> MM-HMM.

948
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:17,163
IT'S A PICTURE OF JAMIE.

949
00:23:17,163 --> 00:23:18,998
>> AW...

950
00:23:18,998 --> 00:23:20,533
THANK YOU, MAMA.

951
00:23:20,533 --> 00:23:21,367
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

952
00:23:21,367 --> 00:23:22,569
>> THEY'RE REALLY CUTE.

953
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:24,170
>> THANKS.

954
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,838
>> [giggles]

955
00:23:25,838 --> 00:23:27,874
YOU'RE SO ALERT.

956
00:23:27,874 --> 00:23:29,709
YOU'RE THE HANDSOMEST LITTLE MAN

957
00:23:29,709 --> 00:23:31,744
I'VE EVER SEEN.

958
00:23:35,748 --> 00:23:37,016
>> DID HE PUKE?

959
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:38,885
>> NOPE, HE BURPED, THOUGH.

960
00:23:38,885 --> 00:23:40,219
SEE, HE'S DOING THE,

961
00:23:40,219 --> 00:23:43,222
"I WANT FOOD."

962
00:23:43,222 --> 00:23:44,223
YOU GOT HIM?

963
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:46,425
>> YEAH.

964
00:23:52,031 --> 00:23:53,833
>> WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN DOING?

965
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,768
>> MAN, I GOT SUSPENDED FROM

966
00:23:55,768 --> 00:23:56,769
WORK, AND I DON'T THINK

967
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:58,437
I'M GONNA EVEN GO BACK THERE.

968
00:23:58,437 --> 00:23:59,371
>> WHY?

969
00:23:59,371 --> 00:24:00,139
>> I DON'T KNOW.

970
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:01,040
THEY'RE TRYING TO, LIKE,

971
00:24:01,040 --> 00:24:02,074
LIMIT ME TO, LIKE,

972
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:03,576
TEN HOURS A WEEK.

973
00:24:03,576 --> 00:24:04,611
>> WHY?

974
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:05,612
>> IT'S LIKE THEY HAD A GRUDGE

975
00:24:05,612 --> 00:24:06,278
AGAINST ME.

976
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,279
I MEAN, THEY COULDN'T WRITE ME

977
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,380
UP FOR IT, BUT THEY WERE LIKE--

978
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,816
NOW THEY GOT A GRUDGE, SO I JUST

979
00:24:09,816 --> 00:24:11,718
KIND OF GOT TO DEAL WITH IT.

980
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,387
>> IT SUCKS THAT JAMIE IS OUT

981
00:24:15,387 --> 00:24:16,889
OF WORK, BUT RIGHT NOW, I'M JUST

982
00:24:16,889 --> 00:24:18,791
GLAD THAT HE'S HERE.

983
00:24:22,428 --> 00:24:23,262
I'M NOT GONNA QUIT

984
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:24,430
TILL YOU BURP.

985
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,131
>> [belches]

986
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:27,767
>> OH, THERE YOU GO.

987
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:28,935
>> ARE YOU OKAY?

988
00:24:28,935 --> 00:24:30,269
>> MM-HMM.

989
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:31,437
>> ARE YOU ABOUT TO DO SOME

990
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:32,104
SCHOOLWORK?

991
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:33,105
>> YEAH, AFTER I'M DONE

992
00:24:33,105 --> 00:24:33,940
FEEDING HIM.

993
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,741
>> I'LL TAKE HIM

994
00:24:34,741 --> 00:24:36,643
IF YOU WANT ME TO.

995
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:37,810
>> MY MOM HAS BEEN HELPING ME

996
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,146
A LOT WITH THE BABY, SO I'VE

997
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:41,080
GOTTEN MORE HOMEWORK DONE

998
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,982
THAN I HAVE IN A WHILE.

999
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,316
IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN EAT

1000
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:48,254
FOR DINNER?

1001
00:24:48,254 --> 00:24:49,589
JAMIE HAS BEEN HELPING A LOT TOO

1002
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:51,791
SINCE HE LOST HIS JOB, BUT HIS

1003
00:24:51,791 --> 00:24:53,292
DAD GOT HIM CONSTRUCTION WORK

1004
00:24:53,292 --> 00:24:54,627
NEAR HIS HOUSE, SO HE'S READY

1005
00:24:54,627 --> 00:24:55,795
TO MOVE BACK THERE.

1006
00:24:55,795 --> 00:24:57,496
>> OH, WAKE UP.

1007
00:24:57,496 --> 00:24:58,397
>> IT'LL BE HARD WITHOUT

1008
00:24:58,397 --> 00:24:59,832
MY MOM'S HELP, BUT I HAVE TO

1009
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,000
CONVINCE HER I'M READY TO DO

1010
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,569
THIS BY MYSELF.

1011
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:04,837
I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE

1012
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:05,838
RAISING MY BABY.

1013
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:06,773
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO IT

1014
00:25:06,773 --> 00:25:08,007
ON MY OWN, AND IF I KEEP RELYING

1015
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,676
ON YOU, WHAT AM I GONNA DO

1016
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:10,843
WHEN HE GET OLDER AND I AM

1017
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:11,744
ON MY OWN?

1018
00:25:11,744 --> 00:25:14,513
I'M PRETTY MATURE FOR MY AGE

1019
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:15,347
ALREADY.

1020
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:16,515
>> YEAH, YOU ARE MATURE FOR

1021
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,085
YOUR AGE, BUT YOU'RE ALSO NAIVE.

1022
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:20,753
AND HONESTLY, I'VE BEEN WASHING

1023
00:25:20,753 --> 00:25:22,454
HIS BOTTLES.

1024
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:24,791
I GO IN AND CLEAR ALL THE

1025
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:26,292
BOTTLES OUT OF YOUR ROOM.

1026
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:27,794
THEY'RE ON THE COUNTERS.

1027
00:25:27,794 --> 00:25:29,461
YOU HAVEN'T EVEN ACKNOWLEDGED

1028
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:30,597
THAT.

1029
00:25:30,597 --> 00:25:31,764
>> OKAY, THEN IF I LIVE THERE,

1030
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:32,799
YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE TO WORRY

1031
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:33,700
ABOUT PICKING UP DIAPERS

1032
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,767
OR CLEANING BOTTLES.

1033
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:36,102
>> THIS IS SERIOUS.

1034
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:37,770
>> THERE'S A MILLION MOMS

1035
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:38,771
OUT THERE, AND THEY DO IT.

1036
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:40,272
WHY DON'T YOU THINK I CAN?

1037
00:25:40,272 --> 00:25:41,440
>> I'M NOT SAYING THAT I DON'T

1038
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,942
THINK YOU CAN, BUT I KNOW THAT

1039
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:44,276
YOU THINK THAT IT'S GONNA

1040
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:45,244
BE GREAT.

1041
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:47,614
YOU DON'T EVEN HEAR ME.

1042
00:25:47,614 --> 00:25:48,615
I KNOW YOU DON'T.

1043
00:25:48,615 --> 00:25:49,515
YOU'RE LOOKING STRAIGHT

1044
00:25:49,515 --> 00:25:50,182
THROUGH ME.

1045
00:25:50,182 --> 00:25:51,117
>> NO, I HEAR YOU.

1046
00:25:51,117 --> 00:25:52,118
>> YOU DON'T WANT TO HEAR

1047
00:25:52,118 --> 00:25:53,953
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.

1048
00:25:53,953 --> 00:25:56,455
I DON'T WANT TO LET YOU GO.

1049
00:25:56,455 --> 00:25:58,457
LIKE, I REALLY DON'T.

1050
00:25:58,457 --> 00:26:00,492
IT'S NOT TIME.

1051
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:01,427
>> YOU'RE NEVER GONNA WANT

1052
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:04,697
TO LET ME GO.

1053
00:26:04,697 --> 00:26:06,032
I UNDERSTAND WHERE MY MOM

1054
00:26:06,032 --> 00:26:07,700
IS COMING FROM, BUT MY MIND

1055
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,368
IS MADE UP.

1056
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:10,469
>> BYE.

1057
00:26:10,469 --> 00:26:11,303
I LOVE YOU.

1058
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:12,972
>> LOVE YOU TOO.

1059
00:26:12,972 --> 00:26:14,306
IT'S TIME FOR US TO TRY TO

1060
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,776
MAKE IT WITHOUT MY MOM'S HELP.

1061
00:26:33,159 --> 00:26:34,026
>> [groans]

1062
00:26:34,026 --> 00:26:36,228
OH, I'M MAKING A MESS.

1063
00:26:36,228 --> 00:26:37,897
>> MOVING INTO JAMIE'S DAD'S

1064
00:26:37,897 --> 00:26:39,098
HOUSE MAKES ME FEEL LIKE WE'RE

1065
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:40,299
FINALLY STARTING OUR LIFE

1066
00:26:40,299 --> 00:26:41,133
AS A FAMILY.

1067
00:26:41,133 --> 00:26:42,635
JAMIE SEEMS HAPPIER ALREADY,

1068
00:26:42,635 --> 00:26:43,636
AND HIS DAD EVEN LINED UP

1069
00:26:43,636 --> 00:26:45,171
A CONSTRUCTION JOB FOR HIM.

1070
00:26:45,171 --> 00:26:46,973
YOU LAUGHING AT YOUR MAMA?

1071
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:52,511
>> OOH, YOU'RE A JERK.

1072
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:53,680
>> YOU'RE A JERK.

1073
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:54,681
>> WHY YOU GONNA KICK ME?

1074
00:26:54,681 --> 00:26:55,547
>> YOU'RE THE ONE THAT

1075
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:56,515
KICKED ME.

1076
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:57,950
>> SO HOW ARE YOU GONNA--

1077
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,286
HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO TOMORROW,

1078
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:01,153
BEING ALL ON YOUR OWN

1079
00:27:01,153 --> 00:27:02,421
WHILE I'M AT WORK?

1080
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:03,422
HOW DO YOU THINK IT'S GONNA BE

1081
00:27:03,422 --> 00:27:06,258
HAVING HIM ALL TO YOURSELF?

1082
00:27:06,258 --> 00:27:07,593
>> I MEAN, I HAVE NO PROBLEM,

1083
00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:10,897
LIKE, TAKING CARE OF HIM ALONE,

1084
00:27:10,897 --> 00:27:13,733
BUT I THINK I'LL DO GOOD.

1085
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:14,633
I MEAN, I KNOW HOW TO DO

1086
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:16,002
EVERYTHING.

1087
00:27:16,002 --> 00:27:18,137
>> IT'S PRETTY SELF-EXPLANATORY.

1088
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:19,071
>> HOW ARE WE GONNA MANAGE

1089
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:20,306
YOUR JOB AND ME DOING MY

1090
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:21,307
HOMEWORK AND EVERYTHING?

1091
00:27:21,307 --> 00:27:22,241
ARE WE GONNA HAVE, LIKE,

1092
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:23,442
A PLAN OR...

1093
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:24,443
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1094
00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:26,245
THAT'S REALLY UP TO YOU.

1095
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:27,213
>> I CAN GET, LIKE, AN HOUR

1096
00:27:27,213 --> 00:27:28,014
WHEN I'M WITH HIM.

1097
00:27:28,014 --> 00:27:29,248
I CAN GET AN HOUR OF HOMEWORK

1098
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:29,916
DONE.

1099
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:30,950
YOU NEED TO TAKE HIM FROM, LIKE,

1100
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:31,784
WHENEVER YOU GET HOME

1101
00:27:31,784 --> 00:27:33,753
TO, LIKE, 10:00 OR 10:30,

1102
00:27:33,753 --> 00:27:34,620
DEPENDING ON WHENEVER

1103
00:27:34,620 --> 00:27:35,688
YOU GET HOME.

1104
00:27:35,688 --> 00:27:37,489
>> YEAH.

1105
00:27:46,432 --> 00:27:47,533
>> JAMIE HAS TO LEAVE THE HOUSE

1106
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:48,935
AT 5:00 A.M. TO GO TO WORK

1107
00:27:48,935 --> 00:27:50,436
WITH HIS DAD.

1108
00:27:50,436 --> 00:27:52,071
I'M REALLY GLAD HE GOT A JOB,

1109
00:27:52,071 --> 00:27:53,239
BECAUSE WE DEFINITELY NEED

1110
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:54,741
THE MONEY, BUT IT DOES MEAN

1111
00:27:54,741 --> 00:27:55,908
I'M GOING TO BE ALONE WITH THE

1112
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:57,910
BABY ALL DAY FOR THE FIRST TIME.

1113
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:58,911
>> [crying]

1114
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:02,114
>> OH, WHAT IS YOUR MALFUNCTION?

1115
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:10,857
EVERYTHING IS DIFFERENT HERE.

1116
00:28:10,857 --> 00:28:12,191
AT MY MOM'S, THINGS WERE TAKEN

1117
00:28:12,191 --> 00:28:13,860
CARE OF FOR ME.

1118
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,994
NOW I HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING

1119
00:28:14,994 --> 00:28:17,496
ON MY OWN.

1120
00:28:17,496 --> 00:28:18,664
BAD DOG.

1121
00:28:18,664 --> 00:28:19,899
OPEN YOUR MOUTH.

1122
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:21,667
OPEN YOUR MOUTH.

1123
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:23,369
AS THE WEEK GOES ON, I REALIZE

1124
00:28:23,369 --> 00:28:24,536
HOW HARD IT IS FOR ME

1125
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:25,872
TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE,

1126
00:28:25,872 --> 00:28:28,174
AND IT'S GETTING REALLY LONELY.

1127
00:28:28,174 --> 00:28:29,041
YOU WANT YOUR BOTTLE?

1128
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:32,845
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?

1129
00:28:32,845 --> 00:28:34,046
TAKING CARE OF THE BABY

1130
00:28:34,046 --> 00:28:35,547
MAKES GETTING ANY HOMEWORK DONE

1131
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:36,816
IMPOSSIBLE.

1132
00:28:36,816 --> 00:28:38,317
BUT WHEN JAMIE GETS HOME,

1133
00:28:38,317 --> 00:28:40,820
HE'S TOO TIRED TO HELP.

1134
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,321
AFTER A WEEK ON MY OWN,

1135
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:43,322
WHEN JAMIE DOES TRY TO HELP

1136
00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:44,991
WITH THE BABY, IT JUST STRESSES

1137
00:28:44,991 --> 00:28:46,658
ME OUT MORE.

1138
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:47,960
PUT THAT JACKET ON HIM.

1139
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:48,961
>> WE'RE GONNA COVER HIM UP.

1140
00:28:48,961 --> 00:28:49,796
IT'S ONLY GONNA TAKE

1141
00:28:49,796 --> 00:28:50,629
TWO SECONDS.

1142
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:51,630
>> NO, YOU NEED TO PUT HIM

1143
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,631
BUCKLED IN.

1144
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:53,465
>> FOR WHAT?

1145
00:28:53,465 --> 00:28:54,300
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1146
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,034
IF YOU DROP IT,

1147
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:57,336
IF THAT THING BROKE.

1148
00:28:57,336 --> 00:28:58,304
THAT THING FLIPPED BEFORE

1149
00:28:58,304 --> 00:28:59,138
WHEN I--HOLDING HIM,

1150
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:00,039
THAT THING FLIPPED BACK.

1151
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,007
>> YEAH, MAYBE YOU, NOT ME.

1152
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:02,008
>> YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU'RE BETTER.

1153
00:29:02,008 --> 00:29:03,309
>> AIN'T NEVER HAPPENED TO ME.

1154
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:03,976
>> OKAY.

1155
00:29:03,976 --> 00:29:04,944
>> I'M A DAD. I'M A DAD.

1156
00:29:04,944 --> 00:29:05,945
>> WELL, YOU DIDN'T KNOW WHAT

1157
00:29:05,945 --> 00:29:07,446
YOU WERE DOING A MINUTE AGO.

1158
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:09,115
>> YEAH, 'CAUSE I WAS GONNA

1159
00:29:09,115 --> 00:29:09,982
DROP HIM.

1160
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:10,983
>> I HATE THAT JAMIE AND I

1161
00:29:10,983 --> 00:29:12,651
ARE ARGUING, AND TO MAKE MATTERS

1162
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:14,153
WORSE, MY MOM CAME OVER WITH

1163
00:29:14,153 --> 00:29:16,655
SOME MORE DISAPPOINTING NEWS.

1164
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:17,323
HEY.

1165
00:29:17,323 --> 00:29:18,024
>> HI, BABY.

1166
00:29:18,024 --> 00:29:19,591
I BROUGHT YOUR GRADES.

1167
00:29:19,591 --> 00:29:21,727
I MISSED YOU.

1168
00:29:21,727 --> 00:29:24,163
YES, I DID.

1169
00:29:24,163 --> 00:29:27,800
WELL, YOU HAVE TWO "F"s.

1170
00:29:30,069 --> 00:29:33,772
SO WHAT'S UP ABOUT THOSE?

1171
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:34,941
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1172
00:29:34,941 --> 00:29:36,275
JUST NEED TO GET ON IT MORE.

1173
00:29:36,275 --> 00:29:37,143
IT'S HARD TO BE ON IT

1174
00:29:37,143 --> 00:29:40,612
ALL THE TIME WHEN I HAVE A BABY.

1175
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,448
>> LOOK AT HIM.

1176
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:43,449
DO YOU WANT HIM TO HAVE

1177
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:45,451
GOOD SHOES OR NASTY SHOES?

1178
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:46,352
>> I WANT HIM TO HAVE

1179
00:29:46,352 --> 00:29:47,519
GOOD SHOES.

1180
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,454
>> SO THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA

1181
00:29:48,454 --> 00:29:50,022
HELP HIM GET NICE SHOES.

1182
00:29:50,022 --> 00:29:50,857
>> I'M TRYING.

1183
00:29:50,857 --> 00:29:52,658
IT'S REALLY HARD.

1184
00:29:52,658 --> 00:29:53,592
[cell phone ringing]

1185
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:55,862
THAT'S MY ONLINE SCHOOL.

1186
00:29:55,862 --> 00:29:57,663
HELLO?

1187
00:29:59,866 --> 00:30:01,667
>> OH, HI, HOW ARE YOU?

1188
00:30:03,269 --> 00:30:05,071
>> I'M PRETTY GOOD.

1189
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:10,376
>> UM, IT'S PRETTY HARD,

1190
00:30:10,376 --> 00:30:12,178
BUT I'M GETTING THERE.

1191
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,422
>> MM-HMM. FRESHMAN?

1192
00:30:27,293 --> 00:30:28,794
>> IF I DO GOOD FROM HERE ON

1193
00:30:28,794 --> 00:30:30,296
OUT, WHEN DO YOU THINK I'LL BE

1194
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:32,098
ABLE TO, LIKE, GRADUATE?

1195
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:40,672
>> OKAY, WELL, THANK YOU.

1196
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,008
I MEAN, REALLY, I DIDN'T KNOW

1197
00:30:42,008 --> 00:30:44,710
I WAS THAT BEHIND.

1198
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:47,880
>> THIS IS ALL GOING DOWNHILL.

1199
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,082
YOU NEED TO COME HOME, BECAUSE

1200
00:30:50,082 --> 00:30:53,085
THERE ARE RULES THERE.

1201
00:30:53,085 --> 00:30:54,086
>> I'M DOING FINE HERE.

1202
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:55,287
>> AND I CAN HELP YOU,

1203
00:30:55,287 --> 00:30:56,288
AND I CAN MAKE SURE THAT

1204
00:30:56,288 --> 00:30:58,157
EVERYTHING'S BEING DONE.

1205
00:30:58,157 --> 00:30:59,491
I'M NOT JUST GOING ON WHAT

1206
00:30:59,491 --> 00:31:00,826
YOU TELL ME, 'CAUSE A LOT OF

1207
00:31:00,826 --> 00:31:01,827
TIMES, YOU DON'T TELL ME

1208
00:31:01,827 --> 00:31:02,828
THE TRUTH.

1209
00:31:02,828 --> 00:31:04,897
YOU TELL ME WHAT I WANT TO HEAR.

1210
00:31:04,897 --> 00:31:06,232
>> I WANT TO STAY HERE

1211
00:31:06,232 --> 00:31:07,733
AT JAMIE'S, BUT IF HE CAN'T

1212
00:31:07,733 --> 00:31:09,235
HELP ME, I DON'T THINK

1213
00:31:09,235 --> 00:31:11,037
THAT'S POSSIBLE.

1214
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:24,016
>> I FOUND OUT I'M IN DANGER

1215
00:31:24,016 --> 00:31:25,851
OF FAILING MY ONLINE SCHOOL.

1216
00:31:25,851 --> 00:31:26,986
>> HOW ARE YOU DOING, BABE?

1217
00:31:26,986 --> 00:31:27,753
>> HOW WAS WORK?

1218
00:31:27,753 --> 00:31:28,687
>> HORRIBLE.

1219
00:31:28,687 --> 00:31:29,621
>> AND FOR ME TO GET BACK

1220
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:30,689
ON TRACK, I'M GOING TO NEED

1221
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:32,191
MORE HELP WITH THE BABY

1222
00:31:32,191 --> 00:31:33,225
FROM JAMIE, WHICH SHOULDN'T BE

1223
00:31:33,225 --> 00:31:34,693
A PROBLEM, BECAUSE IT'S REALLY

1224
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:36,028
IMPORTANT TO HIM THAT ONE OF US

1225
00:31:36,028 --> 00:31:37,196
GRADUATE.

1226
00:31:37,196 --> 00:31:40,566
WELL, DID YOU WANT TO, LIKE...

1227
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:41,400
LIKE, MAKE A PLAN?

1228
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,003
LIKE, I TAKE HIM ALL DAY,

1229
00:31:44,003 --> 00:31:44,971
AND THEN YOU TAKE HIM FOR,

1230
00:31:44,971 --> 00:31:46,205
LIKE, FOUR OR FIVE HOURS,

1231
00:31:46,205 --> 00:31:47,539
AND THEN WE'LL GET YOU TO BED

1232
00:31:47,539 --> 00:31:48,907
AT AROUND 10:00.

1233
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,909
I MEAN, IT AIN'T THAT BAD.

1234
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:54,246
IT'S ONLY FOUR HOURS A DAY.

1235
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,082
>> YEAH, FOUR HOURS A DAY

1236
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:58,417
IS A LOT, WHEN YOU WORK

1237
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,052
A FULL TEN HOURS A DAY.

1238
00:32:00,052 --> 00:32:03,322
IT GETS PRETTY CRAZY.

1239
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:05,157
>> IT MIGHT BE HARD, BUT JAMIE

1240
00:32:05,157 --> 00:32:06,325
HAS TO FIND A WAY TO HELP OUT

1241
00:32:06,325 --> 00:32:07,493
WITH THE BABY, OR I'M NOT GOING

1242
00:32:07,493 --> 00:32:08,995
TO MAKE IT THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL,

1243
00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:10,596
AND MY MOM WON'T LET ME

1244
00:32:10,596 --> 00:32:13,032
LIVE HERE.

1245
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:14,800
BUT SO FAR, IT'S NOT

1246
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,768
LOOKING GOOD, BECAUSE JAMIE

1247
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:17,769
IS MORE INTERESTED IN HANGING

1248
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:18,704
OUT WITH HIS FRIENDS THAN

1249
00:32:18,704 --> 00:32:20,539
HELPING OUT WITH HIS SON.

1250
00:32:20,539 --> 00:32:21,440
>> I'M ABOUT TO GO DOWN

1251
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:24,610
THE STREET FOR A LITTLE BIT.

1252
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,412
>> DON'T MATTER.

1253
00:32:34,353 --> 00:32:35,521
IT SUCKS BEING LEFT ALONE

1254
00:32:35,521 --> 00:32:37,023
WITH THE BABY ALL THE TIME.

1255
00:32:37,023 --> 00:32:38,690
THIS ISN'T HOW I PICTURED THINGS

1256
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,359
AT ALL, AND I'M REALLY STARTING

1257
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:41,860
TO GET FRUSTRATED.

1258
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:44,530
>> SO TELL ME ABOUT JAMIE

1259
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,931
AND YOUR LITTLE DRAMA.

1260
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:46,965
>> WE DON'T EVER REALLY, LIKE,

1261
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,800
GET ALONG ANYMORE, REALLY.

1262
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,336
WE FIGHT ALL THE TIME.

1263
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:52,138
HE'S BEEN, LIKE, GOING OUT

1264
00:32:52,138 --> 00:32:53,072
MORE NOW.

1265
00:32:53,072 --> 00:32:54,173
>> WHERE IS HE GOING OUT TO?

1266
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:55,674
>> JUST WITH A FRIEND.

1267
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:57,376
AND I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO,

1268
00:32:57,376 --> 00:32:58,577
LIKE, DO MY HOMEWORK.

1269
00:32:58,577 --> 00:32:59,545
'CAUSE, I MEAN, I'M ALREADY

1270
00:32:59,545 --> 00:33:01,747
BEHIND, AND I'M TRYING

1271
00:33:01,747 --> 00:33:03,082
TO CATCH UP.

1272
00:33:03,082 --> 00:33:04,250
AND HE AIN'T HELPED OUT

1273
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,417
WITH THAT, LIKE, AT ALL.

1274
00:33:05,417 --> 00:33:07,186
AND I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.

1275
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:08,687
I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH LONGER

1276
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:10,222
I'LL BE ABLE TO PUT UP WITH IT.

1277
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:11,357
>> WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

1278
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:12,358
>> I'D PROBABLY MOVE WITH

1279
00:33:12,358 --> 00:33:14,360
MY MOM.

1280
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,527
I'M HAVING A ROUGH TIME

1281
00:33:15,527 --> 00:33:17,029
AT JAMIE'S DAD'S HOUSE,

1282
00:33:17,029 --> 00:33:18,530
AND IT TURNS OUT HIS DAD IS

1283
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:21,467
HAVING A ROUGH TIME WITH US TOO.

1284
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:22,401
>> YOU KNOW WHEN I WASN'T

1285
00:33:22,401 --> 00:33:23,335
WORKING, I KEPT THIS PLACE

1286
00:33:23,335 --> 00:33:24,136
CLEAN.

1287
00:33:24,136 --> 00:33:25,071
IT'S JUST REAL FRUSTRATING

1288
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:26,172
SOMETIMES.

1289
00:33:26,172 --> 00:33:28,174
>> WELL, I MEAN, I CAN SAY

1290
00:33:28,174 --> 00:33:29,341
THAT I CLEAN.

1291
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:30,376
>> I KNOW YOU DO, BUT HOW MANY

1292
00:33:30,376 --> 00:33:31,677
TIMES IN THE 22 YEARS I'VE BEEN

1293
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:33,179
POURING WALLS HAVE YOU EVER SEEN

1294
00:33:33,179 --> 00:33:34,346
MY MUDDY PANTS LAYING ON

1295
00:33:34,346 --> 00:33:35,514
THE LIVING ROOM FLOOR?

1296
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:36,515
>> YEAH, I MEAN, MAYBE.

1297
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:37,249
>> EVER?

1298
00:33:37,249 --> 00:33:38,584
I WOULDN'T EVEN MIND WASHING

1299
00:33:38,584 --> 00:33:39,585
THE DISHES, IF THEY WERE ALL

1300
00:33:39,585 --> 00:33:40,719
RINSED OUT.

1301
00:33:40,719 --> 00:33:41,587
HELL, THERE WAS FOUR--

1302
00:33:41,587 --> 00:33:42,954
TEN BOWLS IN THERE THAT WERE

1303
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:44,456
COMPLETELY FULL OF SOME KIND

1304
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:46,325
OF SUBSTANCE THAT...

1305
00:33:46,325 --> 00:33:47,159
>> THAT BROWN CRAP?

1306
00:33:47,159 --> 00:33:47,993
>> YEAH.

1307
00:33:47,993 --> 00:33:48,694
>> YEAH.

1308
00:33:48,694 --> 00:33:49,561
I DIDN'T EVEN DO THAT.

1309
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:50,529
I WAS...

1310
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,698
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHO DID THAT.

1311
00:33:52,698 --> 00:33:55,634
>> IT'S HARD, REAL HARD.

1312
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:57,303
YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN ARGUING.

1313
00:33:57,303 --> 00:33:58,304
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO HEAR IT.

1314
00:33:58,304 --> 00:34:00,005
I JUST LEAVE.

1315
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:00,906
YOU KNOW, I DON'T KNOW.

1316
00:34:00,906 --> 00:34:02,108
WHAT THE HELL.

1317
00:34:02,108 --> 00:34:03,109
GOT TO COME TOGETHER

1318
00:34:03,109 --> 00:34:06,945
FOR THAT BABY RIGHT THERE.

1319
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:08,314
>> EW, DUDE.

1320
00:34:08,314 --> 00:34:09,848
HE PUKED EVERYWHERE.

1321
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:11,517
JAMIE'S DAD MAKES A GOOD POINT.

1322
00:34:11,517 --> 00:34:12,684
WE HAVE TO TRY TO PULL IT

1323
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:14,853
TOGETHER FOR JAMIE JR.'S SAKE.

1324
00:34:14,853 --> 00:34:16,188
SO I FOUND A DAY CARE NEARBY

1325
00:34:16,188 --> 00:34:17,189
THAT WILL BE FREE AS LONG AS

1326
00:34:17,189 --> 00:34:18,357
I'M A STUDENT.

1327
00:34:18,357 --> 00:34:19,858
JAMIE DOESN'T LIKE THE IDEA

1328
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:21,560
OF HAVING THE BABY HERE

1329
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:22,994
BUT AGREED TO COME CHECK IT OUT.

1330
00:34:22,994 --> 00:34:23,995
>> IN THIS ROOM, WE HAVE

1331
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:26,098
CHILDREN FROM 6 WEEKS

1332
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:27,433
TO 12 MONTHS.

1333
00:34:27,433 --> 00:34:28,334
WE ASK THAT YOU PREPARE

1334
00:34:28,334 --> 00:34:29,935
YOUR OWN BOTTLES, SUPPLY

1335
00:34:29,935 --> 00:34:34,640
YOUR WIPES AND DIAPERS.

1336
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,641
>> OKAY.

1337
00:34:35,641 --> 00:34:36,642
>> WELL, FEEL FREE TO CALL

1338
00:34:36,642 --> 00:34:37,609
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.

1339
00:34:37,609 --> 00:34:38,510
I'LL LET YOU GUYS THINK

1340
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:39,145
ABOUT IT.

1341
00:34:39,145 --> 00:34:39,778
>> OKAY.

1342
00:34:39,778 --> 00:34:40,746
>> IT WAS NICE MEETING YOU.

1343
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:41,413
>> YOU TOO.

1344
00:34:41,413 --> 00:34:42,314
>> NICE MEETING YOU TOO.

1345
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:43,048
>> THANK YOU.

1346
00:34:43,048 --> 00:34:43,849
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

1347
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:46,017
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1348
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:47,186
I'M NOT REALLY ALL UP FOR

1349
00:34:47,186 --> 00:34:48,187
THE IDEA OF PUTTING HIM

1350
00:34:48,187 --> 00:34:49,521
IN DAY CARE, SO YOU'RE GONNA

1351
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:50,522
PROBABLY BE FIGHTING WITH ME

1352
00:34:50,522 --> 00:34:55,026
ABOUT THIS FOREVER.

1353
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,027
>> I DON'T GET IT, THOUGH.

1354
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,229
LIKE, YOU'RE--LIKE--

1355
00:34:57,229 --> 00:34:58,564
OH, GOD.

1356
00:34:58,564 --> 00:34:59,565
>> IT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA.

1357
00:34:59,565 --> 00:35:00,566
HE'S TOO YOUNG.

1358
00:35:00,566 --> 00:35:01,433
MAYBE WHEN HE'S OLDER,

1359
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:02,401
I CAN SEE, BUT, LIKE,

1360
00:35:02,401 --> 00:35:03,469
NOT RIGHT NOW.

1361
00:35:03,469 --> 00:35:04,636
SERIOUSLY.

1362
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:05,637
>> THAT'S [bleep].

1363
00:35:05,637 --> 00:35:06,772
>> I'M, LIKE, A MILLION PERCENT

1364
00:35:06,772 --> 00:35:08,106
SURE THAT I WOULD RATHER QUIT

1365
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,808
MY JOB THAN PUT HIM IN HERE.

1366
00:35:09,808 --> 00:35:10,476
>> DON'T--

1367
00:35:10,476 --> 00:35:12,144
>> HE CAN WAIT UNTIL HE'S, LIKE,

1368
00:35:12,144 --> 00:35:13,979
1 1/2 OR 2, FOR REAL.

1369
00:35:13,979 --> 00:35:15,481
SERIOUSLY.

1370
00:35:15,481 --> 00:35:16,148
>> MM-HMM.

1371
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:17,015
>> YOU'LL BE GRADUATED

1372
00:35:17,015 --> 00:35:18,150
IN HIGH SCHOOL AROUND THEN.

1373
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:19,017
>> OKAY, I'LL GRADUATE

1374
00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:19,985
A LOT QUICKER IF I PUT HIM

1375
00:35:19,985 --> 00:35:21,119
IN DAY CARE.

1376
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,288
I COULD GO TAKE HIM TO DAY CARE

1377
00:35:22,288 --> 00:35:23,289
FOR A COUPLE HOURS WHILE I--

1378
00:35:23,289 --> 00:35:24,156
>> AND YOU'RE GONNA--

1379
00:35:24,156 --> 00:35:24,923
>> LET ME TALK.

1380
00:35:24,923 --> 00:35:25,757
>> I'LL QUIT MY JOB.

1381
00:35:25,757 --> 00:35:26,758
>> OKAY, CAN YOU LET ME TALK?

1382
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:27,693
>> I COULD COME WATCH HIM

1383
00:35:27,693 --> 00:35:31,897
AT NIGHT.

1384
00:35:31,897 --> 00:35:33,332
>> I MEAN, RIGHT NOW, THAT

1385
00:35:33,332 --> 00:35:34,466
AIN'T--IT'S NOT REALLY WORKING

1386
00:35:34,466 --> 00:35:35,133
RIGHT NOW.

1387
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:35,801
>> WHAT?

1388
00:35:35,801 --> 00:35:36,768
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING?

1389
00:35:36,768 --> 00:35:37,903
>> WELL, YEAH.

1390
00:35:37,903 --> 00:35:39,070
>> YOU'RE JUST [bleep] ANNOYING.

1391
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,172
>> YEAH, YOU'RE PRETTY ANNOYING

1392
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:41,072
TOO.

1393
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:42,007
LIKE, YOU BLOW EVERYTHING

1394
00:35:42,007 --> 00:35:42,941
OUT OF PROPORTION.

1395
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:43,842
>> I BLOW EVERYTHING OUT

1396
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:44,610
OF PROPORTION?

1397
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:45,544
YOU'RE SAYING THAT I DON'T

1398
00:35:45,544 --> 00:35:46,212
WATCH HIM.

1399
00:35:46,212 --> 00:35:47,045
>> NO, BUT YOU LEAVE

1400
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:48,013
ALL THE TIME, WHICH YOU DO,

1401
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:51,817
AND YOU KNOW YOU DO.

1402
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,952
GOD, YOU'RE [bleep] MENTAL.

1403
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,828
>> BYE, JAMIE.

1404
00:36:36,828 --> 00:36:37,829
>> AFTER OUR FIGHT AT THE DAY

1405
00:36:37,829 --> 00:36:38,997
CARE, THINGS BETWEEN ME

1406
00:36:38,997 --> 00:36:41,333
AND JAMIE ARE TENSE.

1407
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:42,334
>> SO WHAT'S GOING ON WITH

1408
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:43,502
YOU AND JAMIE?

1409
00:36:43,502 --> 00:36:44,903
>> IT'S JUST--LATELY, WE'VE JUST

1410
00:36:44,903 --> 00:36:46,405
BEEN FIGHTING REALLY BAD.

1411
00:36:46,405 --> 00:36:47,306
LIKE, WE'VE NEVER FOUGHT

1412
00:36:47,306 --> 00:36:48,507
THAT BAD BEFORE.

1413
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:50,041
WE'LL BE YELLING AT EACH OTHER,

1414
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,243
AND IT'LL CAUSE HIM JUST TO WALK

1415
00:36:51,243 --> 00:36:52,311
OUT, 'CAUSE HE DOESN'T EVEN WANT

1416
00:36:52,311 --> 00:36:53,078
TO FIGHT WITH ME.

1417
00:36:53,078 --> 00:36:54,580
HE'LL JUST LEAVE.

1418
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,747
>> YOU JUST GOT TO MAKE SURE

1419
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:59,251
THAT THE BABY DOESN'T

1420
00:36:59,251 --> 00:37:02,087
EXPERIENCE, LIKE, THE NEGATIVITY

1421
00:37:02,087 --> 00:37:04,590
AROUND HIS PARENTS, BECAUSE

1422
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:07,759
HE'LL THINK THAT'S OKAY.

1423
00:37:07,759 --> 00:37:10,596
SO REMEMBER WHAT YOU TOLD ME

1424
00:37:10,596 --> 00:37:13,765
ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT FINISHING

1425
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:15,634
YOUR SCHOOLING WAS, BECAUSE YOU

1426
00:37:15,634 --> 00:37:17,969
WANTED TO SHOW BABY JAMIE

1427
00:37:17,969 --> 00:37:21,340
THAT YOU BECAME SOMETHING?

1428
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:23,509
>> WELL, THAT HASN'T CHANGED.

1429
00:37:23,509 --> 00:37:25,344
>> WELL, I MEAN, THE WAY THINGS

1430
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:26,845
ARE GOING RIGHT NOW, IT'S NOT

1431
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:28,179
GONNA HAPPEN.

1432
00:37:28,179 --> 00:37:30,115
I MEAN, I SAID I WAS GONNA TAKE

1433
00:37:30,115 --> 00:37:32,284
A SEMESTER OFF, AND I TOOK

1434
00:37:32,284 --> 00:37:35,754
SEVEN YEARS.

1435
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:36,922
SO ARE YOU READY TO COME

1436
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:38,757
BACK HOME?

1437
00:37:38,757 --> 00:37:40,759
OR NOT, OR...

1438
00:37:40,759 --> 00:37:41,760
>> I MEAN, YEAH.

1439
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,761
>> I'VE BEEN TELLING YOU

1440
00:37:42,761 --> 00:37:45,130
ALL ALONG.

1441
00:37:45,130 --> 00:37:46,231
>> I KNOW, BUT I DIDN'T THINK--

1442
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:47,333
>> BUT YOU WANTED TO TRY IT OUT

1443
00:37:47,333 --> 00:37:48,367
ON YOUR OWN.

1444
00:37:48,367 --> 00:37:49,335
>> I DIDN'T THINK YOU'D BE,

1445
00:37:49,335 --> 00:37:50,702
LIKE, THAT BIG OF A HELP

1446
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:52,404
THAT YOU ARE.

1447
00:37:52,404 --> 00:37:53,905
I FEEL LIKE YOU, LIKE,

1448
00:37:53,905 --> 00:37:55,407
HELP EVERYTHING.

1449
00:37:55,407 --> 00:37:56,442
LIKE, IF WE MOVED THERE,

1450
00:37:56,442 --> 00:37:57,343
IT WOULD BE, LIKE, A LOT

1451
00:37:57,343 --> 00:37:57,976
OF HELP.

1452
00:37:57,976 --> 00:37:59,110
>> YEP.

1453
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,612
I'M JUST HAPPY.

1454
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,314
>> YOU ARE NOW?

1455
00:38:02,314 --> 00:38:03,982
NOW THE BABY WILL BE AROUND

1456
00:38:03,982 --> 00:38:05,083
ALL THE TIME.

1457
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:06,051
I'M JUST REALLY HAPPY ABOUT

1458
00:38:06,051 --> 00:38:07,018
MY HOMEWORK, 'CAUSE I KNOW,

1459
00:38:07,018 --> 00:38:08,654
OVER THERE, I'LL GET IT DONE.

1460
00:38:08,654 --> 00:38:10,422
>> YEAH, 'CAUSE I'LL MAKE YOU.

1461
00:38:10,422 --> 00:38:11,490
I'LL PROBABLY BE SITTING

1462
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:12,658
RIGHT NEXT TO YOU,

1463
00:38:12,658 --> 00:38:16,828
AND YOU'LL BE LIKE, "OKAY..."

1464
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:18,564
>> I KNOW LIVING AT MY MOM'S

1465
00:38:18,564 --> 00:38:20,231
IS THE BEST THING FOR NOW,

1466
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:21,400
BUT I DOUBT JAMIE WILL SEE IT

1467
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,570
THAT WAY.

1468
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:27,906
I MEAN, DO YOU...

1469
00:38:27,906 --> 00:38:28,907
I MEAN, ARE WE BOTH MOVING

1470
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:31,076
TO MY MOM'S AND GONNA LIVE THERE

1471
00:38:31,076 --> 00:38:33,111
AND BE TOGETHER, OR AM I GONNA

1472
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:34,279
GO THERE ALONE?

1473
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:36,181
>> THIS WHOLE SITUATION,

1474
00:38:36,181 --> 00:38:37,082
THIS AIN'T ALL MY FAULT.

1475
00:38:37,082 --> 00:38:38,083
>> I'M NOT TELLING YOU THAT.

1476
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:39,084
>> I FEEL LIKE IT'S ALL BEING

1477
00:38:39,084 --> 00:38:40,185
COMPLETELY PUT ON MY SHOULDERS,

1478
00:38:40,185 --> 00:38:40,786
BUT...

1479
00:38:40,786 --> 00:38:42,120
>> I'M NOT TELLING YOU THAT.

1480
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,254
>> I FEEL LIKE EVERYTHING

1481
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:44,756
THAT'S GONE ON IS ON MY

1482
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:47,826
SHOULDERS, AND...

1483
00:38:47,826 --> 00:38:48,727
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

1484
00:38:48,727 --> 00:38:49,895
I'M NOT QUITTING MY JOB AGAIN

1485
00:38:49,895 --> 00:38:51,062
TO COME UP THERE AND STAY UP

1486
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,564
THERE LIKE I DID LAST TIME,

1487
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:55,901
'CAUSE I FELT LIKE...

1488
00:38:55,901 --> 00:38:57,736
COMPLETELY DEPRESSED UP THERE.

1489
00:38:57,736 --> 00:38:58,904
GONNA BE, LIKE, LOCKED UP

1490
00:38:58,904 --> 00:38:59,905
UP THERE.

1491
00:38:59,905 --> 00:39:00,739
>> LIKE I AM HERE.

1492
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:01,573
>> I'M NOT GONNA HAVE

1493
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:03,442
THE FREEDOM TO DRIVE NOWHERE.

1494
00:39:03,442 --> 00:39:04,776
I'M NOT GONNA HAVE THE FREEDOM

1495
00:39:04,776 --> 00:39:06,111
TO WALK NOWHERE.

1496
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:07,145
I'M NOT GONNA HAVE THE FREEDOM

1497
00:39:07,145 --> 00:39:08,780
TO GO ANYWHERE, UNLESS I GET

1498
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,782
SOMEONE ELSE TO TAKE OUT OF

1499
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:11,883
THEIR BUSY SCHEDULE TO TAKE ME.

1500
00:39:11,883 --> 00:39:12,818
>> EXACTLY WHAT I'VE BEEN

1501
00:39:12,818 --> 00:39:13,485
DOING HERE.

1502
00:39:13,485 --> 00:39:14,586
>> BASICALLY, YOU'RE TELLING ME

1503
00:39:14,586 --> 00:39:15,787
I HAVE TO DO THIS, OR WE'RE NOT

1504
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:18,457
GONNA BE TOGETHER.

1505
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:19,991
I JUST DON'T SEE IT WORKING OUT

1506
00:39:19,991 --> 00:39:22,461
LIKE IT'S PLANNED.

1507
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:30,936
>> I WISH THAT I WOULD HAVE BEEN

1508
00:39:30,936 --> 00:39:33,772
ABLE TO, LIKE, KNOW THE REAL

1509
00:39:33,772 --> 00:39:35,607
JAMIE BEFORE I GOT PREGNANT

1510
00:39:35,607 --> 00:39:37,776
WITH HIM.

1511
00:39:37,776 --> 00:39:38,944
IT WOULD HAVE CHANGED A LOT

1512
00:39:38,944 --> 00:39:39,778
FOR ME.

1513
00:39:39,778 --> 00:39:41,112
LIKE, I WOULDN'T BE WITH HIM

1514
00:39:41,112 --> 00:39:42,448
RIGHT NOW AT ALL.

1515
00:39:42,448 --> 00:39:43,782
I THOUGHT THAT MAYBE A BABY

1516
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:45,617
WOULD MAKE OUR RELATIONSHIP

1517
00:39:45,617 --> 00:39:47,786
BETTER, AND IT WAS DEFINITELY

1518
00:39:47,786 --> 00:39:50,288
NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

1519
00:39:50,288 --> 00:39:51,957
I THOUGHT THAT WE WERE GONNA BE,

1520
00:39:51,957 --> 00:39:55,461
LIKE...LIKE A FAMILY.

1521
00:39:55,461 --> 00:39:57,195
WE WERE GONNA GO GET MARRIED,

1522
00:39:57,195 --> 00:39:58,196
AND I WANT TO BE WITH HIM

1523
00:39:58,196 --> 00:39:59,698
MORE THAN ANYTHING, 'CAUSE

1524
00:39:59,698 --> 00:40:01,533
I LOVE HIM, BUT IT ISN'T

1525
00:40:01,533 --> 00:40:03,368
WORKING.

1526
00:40:03,368 --> 00:40:05,036
WHEN I MOVED OUT OF MY MOM'S,

1527
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:07,038
I THOUGHT THAT IT WOULD BE

1528
00:40:07,038 --> 00:40:08,073
LIKE FREEDOM.

1529
00:40:08,073 --> 00:40:09,074
IT WOULD BE LIKE, "WOW.

1530
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:11,242
I'M ABOUT TO GO BE ON MY OWN."

1531
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,079
BUT IT HASN'T REALLY WENT

1532
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,380
THAT WAY.

1533
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:19,551
I'M MOVING BACK IN WITH MY MOM.

1534
00:40:19,551 --> 00:40:20,952
I NEED THE HELP.

1535
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:23,455
>> HE'S A HAPPY MAN.

1536
00:40:23,455 --> 00:40:24,456
>> I FEEL LIKE IF IT KEEPS ON

1537
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:25,957
GOING HOW IT'S GOING NOW,

1538
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:26,825
I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE

1539
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:28,794
TO GRADUATE.

1540
00:40:28,794 --> 00:40:29,728
LIKE, I DON'T HAVE A LIFE

1541
00:40:29,728 --> 00:40:31,429
ANYMORE.

1542
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,798
AFTER I HAD A BABY, ALL MY

1543
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:34,299
FRIENDS JUST COMPLETELY, LIKE,

1544
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:35,333
FORGOT ABOUT ME.

1545
00:40:35,333 --> 00:40:38,436
WHEN PEOPLE WANT ME TO COME OVER

1546
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,605
AND I TELL THEM I HAVE A BABY,

1547
00:40:39,605 --> 00:40:41,139
THEY'RE LIKE, "OH, WELL,

1548
00:40:41,139 --> 00:40:41,973
NEVER MIND."

1549
00:40:41,973 --> 00:40:44,976
OR THEY DITCH ME OR...

1550
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:47,278
IT'S JUST WAY DIFFERENT NOW.

IN MY HOUSE.

1570
00:41:21,613 --> 00:41:22,648
SOMEWHERE.

>> AT HER DAD'S HOUSE?

IF SHE DOESN'T MOVE IN,

1573
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,918
THIS ISN'T GONNA WORK.

A BABY CHANGES PEOPLE'S LIVES.
