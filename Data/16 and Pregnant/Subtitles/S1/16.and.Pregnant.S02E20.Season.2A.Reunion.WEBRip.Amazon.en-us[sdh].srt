and stuff, but...

174

where you have to wake up

there exhausted,

to get up in the middle
of the night.

So... are you still
the primary caretaker,

191
00:07:44,843 --> 00:07:47,639
or has some of that
shifted back to Jenelle?

192
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:50,159
Well, Jenelle's doing
a little better,

193
00:07:50,228 --> 00:07:53,680
but I work 40 hours,
I bring the baby to daycare,

194
00:07:53,749 --> 00:07:56,130
and when I walk in the door,
she leaves.

195
00:07:56,199 --> 00:07:58,788
No-- Mom--And then she comes back
about 9 at night,

196

already in bed.

ready for work,

204
00:08:16,081 --> 00:08:18,187

and says, "I'm tired.

205

But I just wish she'd
kind of step up more.

210
00:08:29,232 --> 00:08:30,924
Jenelle, you told your mom
when you turned 18

211
00:08:30,993 --> 00:08:32,650
you were gonna go away
and never see her again.

and every time we do

859

he always messes it up again

860
00:33:22,655 --> 00:33:24,105
by talking to other girls.

861
00:33:24,174 --> 00:33:26,901

get along when he's there?

862

stuck in the middle?

thanks for joining us.

So, Josh when you watch
the footage of how you behaved

874
00:33:57,794 --> 00:33:58,933
in the labor delivery room,

875
00:33:59,002 --> 00:34:01,108
do you have any thoughts
about that?

876
00:34:01,177 --> 00:34:04,214
There was a lot going on
at that point in my life.

877
00:34:04,283 --> 00:34:08,839
Um, and like the pregnancy
just like pushed me
over the edge.

878
00:34:08,908 --> 00:34:11,704
And instead of facing it
like a man,

879
00:34:11,773 --> 00:34:13,189
I kind of took
the coward way out.

880
00:34:13,258 --> 00:34:16,226
Which was?Like treating Nikkole
like [bleep].

881
00:34:16,295 --> 00:34:18,953
Do you treat her
better now?

882
00:34:19,022 --> 00:34:22,198
I try.
It's still really hard.

883
00:34:22,267 --> 00:34:23,475
[Drew]Rikki?

884
00:34:23,544 --> 00:34:25,753
I believe that Josh
uses Nikkole.

885
00:34:25,822 --> 00:34:27,720
And I don't think
she sees that.

886
00:34:27,789 --> 00:34:29,136
[Drew]
For what?

887
00:34:29,205 --> 00:34:31,724
Um, for a ride,
for money,

888
00:34:31,793 --> 00:34:33,864
for... different things.

889
00:34:33,933 --> 00:34:37,765
Just various things
that he needs,

890
00:34:37,834 --> 00:34:38,904
probably one being sex,

891
00:34:38,973 --> 00:34:41,355
when he's not with
the other girl.

892
00:34:41,424 --> 00:34:44,737
And it hurts me
that I feel that way.

893
00:34:44,806 --> 00:34:47,015
We don't even have sex.

894
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,466
Do you believe that?No.

895
00:34:49,535 --> 00:34:51,813
Do you understand how much
she has sacrificed

896
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:53,160
to raise Lyle?

897
00:34:53,229 --> 00:34:55,058
She sacrificed a lot.

898
00:34:55,127 --> 00:34:57,060
Have you sacrificed
much for Lyle?

899
00:34:58,855 --> 00:35:00,098
No, not really.

00:35:00,167 --> 00:35:02,169
[Drew]No.

What's best for the baby?

902
00:35:04,343 --> 00:35:06,483
For us to sort things out
and to be together,

903
00:35:06,552 --> 00:35:08,485
but there's more and more
obstacles every day.

904
00:35:08,554 --> 00:35:10,729
Rikki, what are we
gonna do with him?

905
00:35:10,798 --> 00:35:14,008
Uh, I think she should
dump him and be done with it.

906
00:35:14,077 --> 00:35:15,837
I have no contact
with him.

907
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:17,391
And your point?
You shouldn't.

908
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,186
You should be done with it.He's the father of my child.

I get that.

How is this environment
gonna affect Lyle,
do you figure, Nikkole?

911

It's not good for him.

912
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,406
It's just a bunch of hate.

913

they just don't wanna try.

in my daughter's life no more.

your differences?

"Okay, people change.
People can change."

927

Once I got your daughter
pregnant, you totally--

928

Once you wanted her
to have an abortion?

929

gonna punch her in the stomach?

punch her in the stomach.

if you let her figure
it out on her own?

938
00:36:25,597 --> 00:36:27,392
I believe he's having sex
with other people,

939
00:36:27,461 --> 00:36:29,946
so when he goes back
to have sex with my daughter,

940

he need to do?

for the first time.

00:49:42,117 --> 00:49:43,635

Yeah.It's just like, um,

1302
00:49:46,224 --> 00:49:48,123
we had come so far,

1303
00:49:48,192 --> 00:49:50,780
and then watching it again
kinda took us back.

1304
00:49:50,849 --> 00:49:53,542
I just-- I don't think
I'll be able to watch it again.

to come to terms with.

Um... my father walked out
and my mother passed away.

it would feel like

1331
00:51:02,093 --> 00:51:04,923
the same thing to Aidan,
and I didn't want that.

Do you still feel that way?

1333
00:51:06,373 --> 00:51:07,581

in this whole situation.

1371
00:52:44,299 --> 00:52:45,921
Would you guys
provide any advice

1372
00:52:45,990 --> 00:52:47,647
to other teens
out there

1373
00:52:47,716 --> 00:52:49,545

a similar situation?

1374
00:52:49,614 --> 00:52:51,271
Consider the adoption.

That's interesting.Now that I've been
through it,

I've really come around.
And I'm really happy
with the decision.

1380
00:52:59,486 --> 00:53:02,040
I mean, it's still not
what I pictured,

1381
00:53:02,109 --> 00:53:05,665
but I mean, even though
that I still have
that chance to see him.

1382
00:53:05,734 --> 00:53:06,942
Do you feel like
he'll have

1383
00:53:07,011 --> 00:53:09,186
a better life
with that family?

1384
00:53:09,255 --> 00:53:12,292
He will definitely have
more things that he needs.

1385
00:53:12,361 --> 00:53:13,466
Definitely.

1386
00:53:13,535 --> 00:53:14,708

other advice

1387
00:53:14,777 --> 00:53:15,985
for other teens
who might be out there

1388
00:53:16,054 --> 00:53:17,228
in a similar position?

1389
00:53:17,297 --> 00:53:18,747
I would definitely
consider it.

1390
00:53:18,816 --> 00:53:21,128
I mean, there's so many people
that don't even know

1391
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:24,373
that open adoption
is an option that they have.

It's been hard but,
in the long run,

1393

Welcome back

I'm Dr. Drew,

who are here in the same place
for the very first time.

1549
00:59:16,518 --> 00:59:17,830
Before we let you guys

1550
00:59:17,899 --> 00:59:19,107
ask questions
of one another,

1551
00:59:19,176 --> 00:59:21,178
I've got a couple things
I want to ask.

1552

Show of hands:
How many of you

1553
00:59:23,283 --> 00:59:25,458
have your own
biological fathers

1554
00:59:25,527 --> 00:59:27,667
in your life with you
presently?

Show of hands.

1556
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,050
Three, interesting.

1557
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:34,881
So how many expect
the father of your baby

1558
00:59:34,950 --> 00:59:37,953
to be in their life
when they're 16?

1559
00:59:39,299 --> 00:59:40,818
Hmm.

1560
00:59:40,887 --> 00:59:44,132
How many of you were
using birth control

1561
00:59:44,201 --> 00:59:46,686
properly when
you got pregnant?

1562
00:59:46,755 --> 00:59:48,377
Only one.[laughter]

1563
00:59:48,446 --> 00:59:50,000
All right, it's critical
for our viewers

1564
00:59:50,069 --> 00:59:51,829
to realize that birth control

1565
00:59:51,898 --> 00:59:54,349
not only helps
prevent pregnancy,

1566
00:59:54,418 --> 00:59:58,249
also condoms help prevent
sexually transmitted diseases.

1567
00:59:58,318 --> 00:59:59,837
Now, these moms
have been waiting

1568
00:59:59,906 --> 01:00:01,080
to ask questions
of one another,

1569
01:00:01,149 --> 01:00:03,392
so let's get right to it.

for whom?

[both chuckling]

1574
01:00:09,329 --> 01:00:12,643
I would like to know,
why are you choosing

1575
01:00:12,712 --> 01:00:15,542
to still try
to be with Josh?

1576
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:18,097
After all
he's done to you.

1577
01:00:18,166 --> 01:00:19,961
I'm not choosing
to be with him.

1578
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:22,101
I'm choosing to possibly
work things out,

1579
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:24,344
just because
I still love him

1580
01:00:24,413 --> 01:00:27,002
and it's for the benefit
of Lyle at the same time.

1581
01:00:27,071 --> 01:00:29,211
Anybody else have
a question?

1582
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,419
I have one for Leah.Yeah.

1583
01:00:30,488 --> 01:00:32,456
Uh, how do you
handle working,

1584
01:00:32,525 --> 01:00:35,493
having your own place,
and raising twins?

1585
01:00:36,563 --> 01:00:38,531
I have a lot of help
watching them.

1586
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:41,603
I don't like taking them
to a daycare,

1587
01:00:41,672 --> 01:00:43,881
so while I'm in school
most of the time

1588
01:00:43,950 --> 01:00:46,263
my grandparents
or my mom

1589
01:00:46,332 --> 01:00:47,644

during the day

1590
01:00:47,713 --> 01:00:49,093
until I get home.

1591
01:00:49,162 --> 01:00:50,819
But otherwise,
it's really hard.

1592
01:00:50,888 --> 01:00:53,719
I'm completely stressed out
by the end of the day.

1593
01:00:55,168 --> 01:00:58,137
I have questions for
whoever wants to answer.

Now that you've

how many girls

1607
01:01:16,742 --> 01:01:19,089
don't have their biological
dads in the picture.

I would be singled out,

keep you guys together.

people will see your stories
