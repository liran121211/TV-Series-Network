INSIDE EACH MOTHER'S STORY.

32
00:01:08,467 --> 00:01:09,767
WE'RE GONNA TALK IN-DEPTH WITH

THEY'RE IN THE BUILDING AS WELL.

37
00:01:17,767 --> 00:01:19,233
WHICH OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS

38
00:01:19,233 --> 00:01:20,167
STEPPED UP, AND WHICH STEPPED

39
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:20,933
OUT?

40
00:01:20,933 --> 00:01:22,400
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO STAY TUNED

41
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:23,700
TO SEE WHO'S HERE.

42
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,100
BUT FIRST, I'VE GOT SOME

43
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,167
QUESTIONS FOR YOU GUYS.

44
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:27,567
IMAGINE THAT.

45
00:01:27,567 --> 00:01:28,967
MACI, WHAT'S THE HARDEST PART

46
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:30,900
ABOUT BEING A MOM?

47
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:31,667
>> WELL, I THINK THE HARDEST

48
00:01:31,667 --> 00:01:33,067
PART ABOUT BEING A TEEN MOM IS

49
00:01:33,067 --> 00:01:34,533
BEING YOUNG AND HAVING TO GROW

50
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:37,100
UP WITHIN NINE MONTHS AND HAVING

51
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,100
TO BE READY AND LOSE FRIENDS AND

52
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,167
GAIN FRIENDS AND WORRY ABOUT

53
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:42,267
PEOPLE AND WHAT THEY'RE SAYING,

54
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:45,200
AND THEN, BEING A MOM IS JUST

55
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,133
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE

56
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:46,967
YOU'RE GONNA GET YOUR ENERGY,

57
00:01:46,967 --> 00:01:48,467
HOW YOU'RE GONNA DO THIS,

58
00:01:48,467 --> 00:01:49,600
HOW YOU'RE GONNA PAY FOR THAT,

59
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,367
HOW YOU'RE--JUST EVERYTHING.

60
00:01:51,367 --> 00:01:53,167
YOU JUST HAVE TO GET EVERYTHING

61
00:01:53,167 --> 00:01:54,933
INTO ONE LITTLE PACKAGE IN NINE

62
00:01:54,933 --> 00:01:56,833
MONTHS.

63
00:01:56,833 --> 00:01:57,567
>> YOU HAVE TO LET GO OF YOUR

64
00:01:57,567 --> 00:01:58,867
YOUTH AND BECOME A GROWN-UP,

65
00:01:58,867 --> 00:01:59,833
BOOM.

66
00:01:59,833 --> 00:02:01,467
>> RIGHT, IN A SECOND.

67
00:02:01,467 --> 00:02:02,233
>> AND YOU HOPE YOUR PARTNER

68
00:02:02,233 --> 00:02:02,967
KEEPS UP WITH THAT.

69
00:02:02,967 --> 00:02:04,433
>> RIGHT.

70
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:06,267
>> AND, AMBER, LABOR WAS TOUGH,

71
00:02:06,267 --> 00:02:07,167
RIGHT?

72
00:02:07,167 --> 00:02:07,933
>> OH, YEAH.

73
00:02:07,933 --> 00:02:09,500
[laughter]

74
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,167
>> HOW BAD WAS IT?

75
00:02:10,167 --> 00:02:11,133
>> WELL, THEY DIDN'T SHOW

76
00:02:11,133 --> 00:02:13,400
EVERYTHING EXACTLY ON THE SHOW.

77
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,267
I PUKED 51 TIMES DURING IT.

78
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:16,633
>> BUT WHO'S COUNTING?

79
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:18,267
>> THE NURSE WAS COUNTING.

80
00:02:18,267 --> 00:02:19,167
[laughter]

81
00:02:19,167 --> 00:02:20,067
>> EBONY, MOTHERHOOD'S TOUGH AT

82
00:02:20,067 --> 00:02:20,733
ANY AGE.

83
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:21,533
WHAT WAS IT LIKE DOING IT

84
00:02:21,533 --> 00:02:22,567
THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL?

85
00:02:22,567 --> 00:02:23,667
>> IN YOUR SENIOR YEAR, YOU WANT

86
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:25,400
TO PARTY, AND YOU'RE DONE WITH

87
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,200
HIGH SCHOOL NOW, AND I WAS

88
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,400
PREGNANT FROM THE START TO THE

89
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,933
END OF MY SENIOR YEAR.

90
00:02:31,933 --> 00:02:33,533
>> WELL, BEFORE WE GET GOING,

91
00:02:33,533 --> 00:02:35,967
LET'S LOOK AT A QUICK LOOK BACK

92
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:37,833
AT SIX INCREDIBLE STORIES.

93
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,633
HERE'S WHAT WENT DOWN ON THIS

94
00:02:39,633 --> 00:02:42,333
SEASON OF 16 AND PREGNANT. 

95
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:46,467
>> MOM!

96
00:02:46,467 --> 00:02:47,600
>> WHAT?

97
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,867
>> I THINK MY WATER JUST BROKE.

98
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:53,167
>> SHE'S 16 YEARS OLD.

99
00:02:53,167 --> 00:02:54,067
SHE'S A BABY.

100
00:02:54,067 --> 00:02:55,733
>> I JUST CANNOT HANDLE THIS.

101
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:56,933
>> PUSH, PUSH.

102
00:02:56,933 --> 00:02:57,667
>> IF I GAVE HER UP FOR

103
00:02:57,667 --> 00:02:58,733
ADOPTION, LIKE, I HAD GIVEN

104
00:02:58,733 --> 00:02:59,867
SOMEBODY, LIKE, AN AWESOME GIFT.

105
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:00,867
>> I AM A TEENAGER.

106
00:03:00,867 --> 00:03:02,067
YOU DON'T CARE.

107
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:02,667
>> ABOUT WHAT?

108
00:03:02,667 --> 00:03:03,533
>> ABOUT ME.

109
00:03:03,533 --> 00:03:04,500
>> WE CAN'T STAND IT HERE

110
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,233
ANYMORE.

111
00:03:05,233 --> 00:03:08,100
>> TOMORROW, Y'ALL NEED TO MOVE.

112
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,333
>> ALL THAT BABY NEEDS IS LOVE.

113
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,700
>> NO, THAT'S NOT ALL A BABY

114
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,100
NEEDS IS LOVE.

115
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,900
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ANYTHING

116
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,133
ABOUT PARENTING.

117
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:14,967
>> THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HAVING

118
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:16,367
A BEAUTIFUL SITUATION RIGHT

119
00:03:16,367 --> 00:03:17,700
NOW, HUH, FARRAH?

120
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:18,500
>> YEAH, 'CAUSE I HAVE TO DEAL

121
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,233
WITH YOU; YOU'RE RIGHT.

122
00:03:19,233 --> 00:03:21,067
>> I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

123
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,167
>> HOLD HIM, AND HE WILL STOP

124
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:22,833
CRYING.

125
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,233
>> NO, I'LL LEAVE, PERIOD.

126
00:03:24,233 --> 00:03:25,167
>> THEN LEAVE.

127
00:03:25,167 --> 00:03:26,167
>> [crying] LIKE, I'M JUST THE

128
00:03:26,167 --> 00:03:27,800
ONE THAT GREW UP TOO FAST.

129
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,100
AND I WANT HIM TO GROW UP TOO.

130
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:32,067
>> WELL, I JUST FEEL LIKE

131
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:33,667
EVERYBODY IS STARING AT ME,

132
00:03:33,667 --> 00:03:35,433
BECAUSE I HAVE A BEACH BALL

133
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:36,600
UNDER MY SHIRT.

134
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,400
>> I KNOW THAT YOU GUYS CAN

135
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,500
PROVIDE FOR HER A LOT

136
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,267
MORE THAN I CAN.

137
00:03:39,267 --> 00:03:40,067
I JUST WANT HER TO HAVE

138
00:03:40,067 --> 00:03:41,133
BETTER THAN WHAT I HAD.

139
00:03:41,133 --> 00:03:42,367
>> IF WE DIDN'T HAVE A KID,

140
00:03:42,367 --> 00:03:44,333
WE WOULDN'T BE TOGETHER.

141
00:03:47,633 --> 00:03:48,900
>> I AM HERE WITH ONE OF OUR

142
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,800
TEEN MOMS AND HER MOM AS WELL.

143
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,733
FARRAH, DEBRA, WELCOME TO THE

144
00:03:51,733 --> 00:03:52,400
SHOW, GUYS.

145
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,367
[cheers and applause]

146
00:03:57,367 --> 00:04:00,867
SO, FARRAH, FROM CHEERLEADER TO

147
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:02,567
MOM, I MEAN, WHAT WAS THAT

148
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:03,700
TRANSITION LIKE FROM HIGH

149
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,300
SCHOOL STUDENT TO PARENT?

150
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,667
>> IT WAS A BIG TRANSITION.

151
00:04:06,667 --> 00:04:08,100
IT WAS A LOT FOR ME TO GET USED

152
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,067
TO, BUT IT WAS NECESSARY,

153
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:11,833
AND I THOUGHT I WAS ALLOWED

154
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:13,233
PLENTY OF TIME, I GUESS, THE

155
00:04:13,233 --> 00:04:14,467
NINE MONTHS WAS PLENTY OF TIME

156
00:04:14,467 --> 00:04:15,400
FOR ME TO DO IT.

157
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,267
>> WERE THERE FRIENDS THERE TO

158
00:04:16,267 --> 00:04:17,233
SUPPORT YOU?

159
00:04:17,233 --> 00:04:18,567
>> I DID HAVE SOME FRIENDS THAT

160
00:04:18,567 --> 00:04:19,767
WERE THERE TO SUPPORT ME.

161
00:04:19,767 --> 00:04:20,767
I STILL HAVE SOME OF THOSE

162
00:04:20,767 --> 00:04:21,733
FRIENDS, BUT LOTS OF THEM,

163
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:22,767
UNFORTUNATELY, I DON'T TALK TO

164
00:04:22,767 --> 00:04:23,833
ANYMORE.

165
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,567
>> SOUNDS PAINFUL.

166
00:04:25,567 --> 00:04:26,333
>> NO.

167
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,200
>> NOT PAINFUL.

168
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,500
>> YOU DON'T WANT SOMETHING THAT

169
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,500
HOLDS YOU BACK IN LIFE.

170
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,200
>> AND THE BABY, SOPHIA, HOW'S

171
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:32,933
SHE DOING?

172
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:33,833
>> GREAT.

173
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:34,567
SHE'S GROWING.

174
00:04:34,567 --> 00:04:35,700
SHE'S FOUR MONTHS NOW.

175
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:36,733
>> FANTASTIC.

176
00:04:36,733 --> 00:04:38,333
WELL, LET'S TAKE A LOOK BACK AT

177
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:39,933
FARRAH'S JOURNEY ON 16 AND 

178
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:44,767
 PREGNANT. 

179
00:04:44,767 --> 00:04:46,333
>> EVERYBODY AT EVERY SCHOOL

180
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,433
IS SAYING THE RUMORS.

181
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:48,333
NONE OF THE GIRLS KNOW

182
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:49,700
BESIDES YOU AND COURTNEY, SO...

183
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,933
>> YOU'RE THAT POPULAR, FARRAH.

184
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:52,167
>> AND YOU KNOW THEY JUDGE YOU

185
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,467
'CAUSE YOU'RE A SINGLE MOM.

186
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:54,167
>> THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO BE

187
00:04:54,167 --> 00:04:54,833
LEADERS.

188
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,167
>> CHEER "LEADERS," NOT CHEER

189
00:04:57,167 --> 00:04:58,100
"FOLLOWERS."

190
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,300
>> AFTER YOU HAVE THE BABY,

191
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,300
YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA BE ALL

192
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,233
PUFFED UP.

193
00:05:01,233 --> 00:05:02,400
>> NO, I PLAN ON NOT BEING

194
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,367
THAT PUFFED UP.

195
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:05,333
I'M SO SORRY EVERYONE HAS

196
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,800
TO LOOK AT MY CROTCH RIGHT NOW.

197
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,900
I JUST CANNOT HANDLE THIS.

198
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,300
>> PUSH, PUSH, PUSH, PUSH.

199
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,133
>> [crying]

200
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:13,533
>> OH, SHE'S SO CUTE.

201
00:05:13,533 --> 00:05:15,067
>> HOW MUCH WOULD YOU HELP A

202
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:15,733
LITTLE BIT?

203
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,433
>> PROBABLY NOT TOO MUCH.

204
00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:18,400
>> THAT IS SERIOUSLY JUST

205
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:19,600
PISSING ME OFF.

206
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,467
>> THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HAVING

207
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:21,900
A BEAUTIFUL SITUATION RIGHT

208
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,333
NOW, HUH, FARRAH?

209
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,200
>> YEAH, 'CAUSE I HAVE TO DEAL

210
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:24,967
WITH YOU; YOU'RE RIGHT.

211
00:05:24,967 --> 00:05:28,167
>> I'VE HAD ENOUGH.

212
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:34,433
>> SO, DEBRA, THE SMACK:

213
00:05:34,433 --> 00:05:35,400
PEOPLE AROUND HERE ARE CALLING

214
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,300
THAT "THE SMACK HEARD AROUND THE

215
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:36,967
WORLD."

216
00:05:36,967 --> 00:05:39,067
IS IT OKAY TO HIT YOUR KIDS?

217
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:40,067
DO YOU WANT FARRAH TO HIT

218
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:41,133
SOPHIA?

219
00:05:41,133 --> 00:05:42,300
>> I DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT I

220
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,133
ACTUALLY HIT HER.

221
00:05:43,133 --> 00:05:44,333
I WAS DRIVING DOWN THE ROAD KIND

222
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,967
OF FAST, AND I HIT SOMETHING.

223
00:05:45,967 --> 00:05:47,867
>> DO YOU REGRET YELLING AT HER?

224
00:05:47,867 --> 00:05:48,533
>> NO.

225
00:05:48,533 --> 00:05:49,367
>> YOU DON'T REGRET YELLING AT

226
00:05:49,367 --> 00:05:50,067
HER.

227
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:51,600
>> NO, I THINK THAT IT'S--AS A

228
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,100
PARENT, IF YOU LOVE YOUR CHILD,

229
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,733
YOU HAVE TO TELL THEM WHEN--WHEN

230
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:57,067
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH ON SOMETHING.

231
00:05:57,067 --> 00:05:58,600
YOU HAVE TO--YOU'RE THERE TO

232
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,067
GUIDE THEM.

233
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:01,300
IT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE

234
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,500
OVERBEARING, AS I'VE BEEN

235
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,533
CALLED, BUT IT MEANS THAT YOU

236
00:06:04,533 --> 00:06:05,367
HAVE TO LOVE THEM--

237
00:06:05,367 --> 00:06:06,267
>> OVERBEARING?

238
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:07,733
IS YOUR MOM OVERBEARING?

239
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:09,067
>> SHE'S MY MOM.

240
00:06:09,067 --> 00:06:09,667
SHE DOES--

241
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:10,433
>> IS YOUR MOM OVERBEARING?

242
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:11,233
>> I WOULD SAY NO.

243
00:06:11,233 --> 00:06:11,867
>> NO.

244
00:06:11,867 --> 00:06:12,567
>> NO, DR. DREW, NO.

245
00:06:12,567 --> 00:06:13,367
>> OKAY.

246
00:06:13,367 --> 00:06:14,800
[laughter]

247
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,233
WELL, YOU DIDN'T HAVE A BABY

248
00:06:16,233 --> 00:06:18,100
DADDY, BUT YOU HAD YOUR MOMMY.

249
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:18,767
>> YES.

250
00:06:18,767 --> 00:06:19,433
>> WAS THAT HELPFUL?

251
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:20,800
>> YES, I WOULD PREFER IT BE

252
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,600
WITH MY MOM THAN THE BABY DADDY,

253
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,533
SO I WAS VERY LUCKY IN THAT

254
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:24,233
SENSE.

255
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:25,333
>> BUT, YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU WATCH

256
00:06:25,333 --> 00:06:26,100
THE SEGMENT, YOU SEE A LOT OF

257
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:28,567
DRAMA WITH YOU GUYS.

258
00:06:28,567 --> 00:06:29,733
IS THAT WORKING OUT BETTER NOW?

259
00:06:29,733 --> 00:06:30,400
IS IT...

260
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:31,467
>> WHEN I WATCH THE OTHER GIRLS

261
00:06:31,467 --> 00:06:34,067
WITH THEIR BABY DADDIES,

262
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:35,100
IT SEEMED LOTS OF DRAMA KIND OF

263
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,100
WITH THAT, THOUGH, TOO.

264
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:36,800
>> IT'S TRUE.

265
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,633
IT PUTS A LOT OF STRESS ON

266
00:06:37,633 --> 00:06:38,600
RELATIONSHIPS.

267
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,733
WELL, THROUGHOUT TODAY'S SHOW,

268
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:40,500
WE'RE GOING TO BE TAKING

269
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,567
QUESTIONS FROM OUR STUDIO

270
00:06:41,567 --> 00:06:42,633
AUDIENCE AS WELL AS VIEWERS AT

271
00:06:42,633 --> 00:06:43,300
HOME.

272
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:44,900
JESSICA HERE IN THE AUDIENCE HAS

273
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,700
A QUESTION FOR FARRAH.

274
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,567
>> HI, FARRAH, I'M JESSICA.

275
00:06:47,567 --> 00:06:48,933
I CAN REALLY RELATE TO YOU,

276
00:06:48,933 --> 00:06:50,433
BECAUSE I WAS A SINGLE TEEN MOM

277
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:51,600
AND HAD TO JUMP BACK INTO THE

278
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,100
DATING SCENE AT ONE POINT,

279
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,467
SO I WAS WONDERING, HAVE YOU

280
00:06:54,467 --> 00:06:55,967
BEEN GOING ON ANY DATES, OR DO

281
00:06:55,967 --> 00:06:57,233
YOU CURRENTLY HAVE A BOYFRIEND?

282
00:06:57,233 --> 00:06:59,567
>> MM, I WISH I COULD FIND A

283
00:06:59,567 --> 00:07:01,467
MAN.

284
00:07:01,467 --> 00:07:03,967
[laughter]

285
00:07:03,967 --> 00:07:05,233
>> DEBRA, HOW DO YOU FEEL

286
00:07:05,233 --> 00:07:06,233
ABOUT FARRAH DATING?

287
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:08,367
>> WELL, I THINK SHE'S GOT SO

288
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:10,133
MANY OTHER PRIORITIES RIGHT NOW,

289
00:07:10,133 --> 00:07:12,633
BUT I TOLD HER THAT IF SHE WANTS

290
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,067
TO DATE, AND IF SHE FINDS

291
00:07:14,067 --> 00:07:15,800
SOMEBODY THAT IS FLEXIBLE ENOUGH

292
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,633
TO UNDERSTAND HER SCHEDULING AND

293
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:20,100
SO FORTH DEMANDS, I NEED TO MEET

294
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,300
HIM.

295
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,367
WE NEED SOMEBODY REAL.

296
00:07:24,367 --> 00:07:25,467
WE DON'T NEED ANY STORIES OR

297
00:07:25,467 --> 00:07:26,967
WANNABES.

298
00:07:26,967 --> 00:07:28,067
WE NEED SOMEBODY THAT'S

299
00:07:28,067 --> 00:07:29,467
ABSOLUTELY A REAL PERSON.

300
00:07:29,467 --> 00:07:30,533
>> SOMEBODY WHO LOVES FARRAH?

301
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:32,067
>> YEAH, EXACTLY.

302
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:32,933
>> AND SOPHIA.

303
00:07:32,933 --> 00:07:34,433
>> AND SOPHIA.

304
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:35,233
YOU HAVE TO LOVE THE WHOLE

305
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:36,067
PACKAGE.

306
00:07:36,067 --> 00:07:37,733
>> YEAH, IT IS A PACKAGE,

307
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:38,967
INCLUDING ME.

308
00:07:38,967 --> 00:07:39,900
[laughter]

309
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,800
>> THANK GOD, OF COURSE.

310
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,900
>> WELL, THERE'S SOMETHING I

311
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,567
WOULD LIKE TO ADD.

312
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:45,667
WE'VE BEEN TALKING A LOT ABOUT

313
00:07:45,667 --> 00:07:46,900
THE TOUGH CHOICES THAT COME

314
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,867
WITH TEEN PREGNANCY:

315
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:48,967
WHETHER OR NOT TO STAY IN

316
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:50,267

00:07:50,267 --> 00:07:52,200
CAREER, ABORTIONS, ADOPTION,

318
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,867
SO MUCH MORE.

319
00:07:53,867 --> 00:07:55,667
BUT IF PREVENTION OCCURS

320
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:57,167
AND TEENS ARE SMART ABOUT HOW

321
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:58,667
THEY CONDUCT THEMSELVES, THESE

322
00:07:58,667 --> 00:08:00,400
IMPOSSIBLE DECISIONS DO NOT HAVE

323
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,800
TO BE THEN MADE, SO LEARN MORE

324
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,767

MACI, THANK YOU FOR COMING.

353
00:09:08,633 --> 00:09:09,400
SO WHAT'S IT BEEN LIKE?

354
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,667
HOW HAS THE ADJUSTMENT BEEN WITH

355
00:09:10,667 --> 00:09:11,800
THE BABY?

356
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:13,200
>> IT'S CRAZY.

357
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,367
YOU'RE BUSY ALL THE TIME, 24-7.

358
00:09:15,367 --> 00:09:17,767
YOU NEVER GET A BREAK.

359
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:19,967
YOU HAVE TO PACK THINGS,

360
00:09:19,967 --> 00:09:21,667
AND YOU CAN'T FORGET ANYTHING,

361
00:09:21,667 --> 00:09:23,500
OR YOU'RE IN BIG TROUBLE,

362
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,700
AND RELATIONSHIPS ARE HARD,

363
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,967
AND MONEY IS HARD, AND JUST

364
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:27,933
EVERYTHING.

365
00:09:27,933 --> 00:09:30,600
IT'S A HUGE CHANGE FROM BEING

366
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,333
16 TO BEING 16 AND A MOM.

367
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,200
>> CAN YOU UPDATE US ON BENTLEY?

368
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:34,833
HOW'S HE DOING?

369
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:35,667
>> HE'S WONDERFUL.

370
00:09:35,667 --> 00:09:36,700
HE'S EIGHT MONTHS OLD, AND HE

371
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,867
JUST STARTED CRAWLING, LIKE, A

372
00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:38,933
WEEK AND A HALF AGO.

373
00:09:38,933 --> 00:09:40,667
HE HAS NO TEETH.

374
00:09:40,667 --> 00:09:42,067
HE JUST DECIDED NOT TO GET ANY,

375
00:09:42,067 --> 00:09:42,700
I GUESS.

376
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,767
[laughter]

377
00:09:43,767 --> 00:09:45,133
HE SLEEPS THROUGH THE NIGHT,

378
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:46,533
WHICH IS AWESOME.

379
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:47,200
I DON'T KNOW.

380
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:47,867
HE'S AWESOME.

381
00:09:47,867 --> 00:09:49,067
HE HAS THE BEST PERSONALITY,

382
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:50,600
AND IT'S JUST A REALLY FUN AGE

383
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,500
RIGHT NOW.

384
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,500
IT'S AWESOME.

385
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,800
>> NICE, WELL, WE'LL TALK ABOUT

386
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,600
BENTLEY'S FATHER, RYAN,

387
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,500
IN A MINUTE--LET ME AT HIM--

388
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,133
BUT FIRST, HERE'S A QUICK TRIP

389
00:10:00,133 --> 00:10:02,100
DOWN MEMORY LANE.

390
00:10:07,867 --> 00:10:09,100
>> [crying]

391
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,167
>> IT'S YOUR TURN.

392
00:10:10,167 --> 00:10:11,167
>> CAN'T YOU JUST HOLD HIM TILL

393
00:10:11,167 --> 00:10:12,633
I GET DONE WITH MY HOMEWORK?

394
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:13,533
>> I DON'T THINK HE WAS,

395
00:10:13,533 --> 00:10:14,333
LIKE, READY TO HAVE A KID YET.

396
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,400
>> AND I WASN'T READY EITHER,

397
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,967
BUT I GREW UP BECAUSE I HAD TO.

398
00:10:16,967 --> 00:10:20,600
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

399
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,067
OKAY.

400
00:10:22,067 --> 00:10:22,900
>> SO YOU DON'T THINK RYAN WILL

401
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:23,567
COME BY?

402
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:24,833
>> WHY DON'T YOU TEXT HIM?

403
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:25,733
>> YOU WANT ME TO TEXT HIM?

404
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:26,400
>> YEAH, HIS MOM--

405
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,200
>> NO, 'CAUSE THEN I'LL BE

406
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
THE WITCHY MOTHER-IN-LAW.

407
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,333
>> SO?

408
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:30,667
>> [laughs]

409
00:10:30,667 --> 00:10:32,067
>> HOLD HIM, AND HE WILL STOP

410
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:32,733
CRYING.

411
00:10:32,733 --> 00:10:33,933
>> NO, I'LL LEAVE, PERIOD.

412
00:10:33,933 --> 00:10:35,033
>> THEN LEAVE.

413
00:10:35,033 --> 00:10:36,067
I MEAN, I DON'T THINK IF WE

414
00:10:36,067 --> 00:10:37,033
WERE IN THIS SITUATION,

415
00:10:37,033 --> 00:10:38,167
WE WOULD BE THIS UNHAPPY

416
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:39,167
RIGHT NOW.

417
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:40,433
>> NO, IF WE DIDN'T HAVE A KID,

418
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:43,100
WE WOULDN'T BE TOGETHER.

419
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,333
>> OKAY, WELL, I DON'T WANT YOU

420
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,833
TO STAY HERE BECAUSE YOU FEEL

421
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,800
LIKE YOU HAVE TO.

422
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:01,067
>> WELL, MACI, AT ONE POINT,

423
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:01,867
YOU SAID YOU FELT LIKE YOU HAD

424
00:11:01,867 --> 00:11:02,567
TWO BABIES.

425
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:03,367
>> MM-HMM.

426
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:04,233
>> RYAN?

427
00:11:04,233 --> 00:11:05,167
>> YES.

428
00:11:05,167 --> 00:11:06,200
>> IS HE STILL--YOU STILL HAVE

429
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,867
TWINS?

430
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:08,133
>> UM...

431
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:09,100
IT'S GETTING BETTER.

432
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,833
I'VE GOT TWO DIFFERENT-AGED

433
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:12,067
TWINS.

434
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:13,067
>> OH, HE'S STILL BEHAVING LIKE

435
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:13,700
A LITTLE CHILD.

436
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,367
>> WELL, NO.

437
00:11:14,367 --> 00:11:15,200
HE'S GOTTEN A LOT BETTER.

438
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,100
IT TOOK HIM--IT TOOK HIM A WHILE

439
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:19,867
TO ADJUST FROM BEING AN ONLY

440
00:11:19,867 --> 00:11:21,367
CHILD TO BEING A FATHER.

441
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:22,933
I DON'T THINK I HAD AS MUCH

442
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,067
PATIENCE FOR HIM AS I SHOULD

443
00:11:24,067 --> 00:11:25,467
HAVE, BUT, I MEAN, HE'S STILL

444
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:26,600
NOT PERFECT, BUT HE'S DEFINITELY

445
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,267
GETTING THERE.

446
00:11:27,267 --> 00:11:28,100
HE'S DOING A WHOLE LOT BETTER,

447
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:29,400
AND I THINK SEEING THE SHOW

448
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:30,833
HELPED CHANGE HIM A LOT.

449
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:33,600
HE FINALLY REALIZED HOW SELFISH

450
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,667
HE WAS BEING, SO HE'S DOING A

451
00:11:34,667 --> 00:11:35,700
LOT BETTER NOW.

452
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,167
>> SO REALLY ACTUALLY VIEWING

453
00:11:37,167 --> 00:11:38,800
YOUR PROGRAM IS WHAT BROKE

454
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,300
THROUGH TO HIM AND GOT HIM TO

455
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,267
STEP IT UP A BIT?

456
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:42,700
>> I THINK HIS PARENTS AND MY

457
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:44,233
PARENTS BOTH SAW THE PROBLEMS WE

458
00:11:44,233 --> 00:11:46,467
WERE HAVING, AND HIS DAD, I

459
00:11:46,467 --> 00:11:47,967
THINK, WAS KIND OF DISAPPOINTED

460
00:11:47,967 --> 00:11:49,367
IN THE WAY HE WAS ACTING,

461
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:50,300
BECAUSE HIS PARENTS DIDN'T RAISE

462
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,100
HIM TO BE THAT WAY, AND SO HIS

463
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,733
DAD HAD TO TALK TO HIM A FEW

464
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:55,233
TIMES, AND AFTER SEEING THE

465
00:11:55,233 --> 00:11:56,400
SHOW, I THINK IT ALL JUST

466
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,067
FINALLY GOT TO HIM, AND HE

467
00:11:58,067 --> 00:12:00,067
REALIZED EVERYTHING.

468
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:00,867
>> WHAT HAVE YOU GIVEN UP TO BE

469
00:12:00,867 --> 00:12:03,100
A TEEN MOM?

470
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,767
>> EVERYTHING.

471
00:12:03,767 --> 00:12:06,467
YOU GIVE UP YOUR SOCIAL LIFE.

472
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:08,667
YOU GIVE UP HAVING TO FIGURE OUT

473
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:09,600
HOW YOU'RE GONNA GRADUATE HIGH

474
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:10,400
SCHOOL.

475
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,800
YOU GIVE UP YOUR SENIOR PROM.

476
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,400
YOU GIVE UP YOUR ATHLETICS AT

477
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,467
SCHOOL.

478
00:12:14,467 --> 00:12:16,533
YOU GIVE UP ALMOST EVERYTHING,

479
00:12:16,533 --> 00:12:19,933
BUT TO GAIN SOMETHING ELSE.

480
00:12:19,933 --> 00:12:21,867
>> I KNOW THE PEOPLE THAT STUDY

481
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:24,500
SINGLE MOMS ALWAYS SAY THE ONE

482
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,567
THING THEY WANT TO GIVE THEM IS

483
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:26,233
A SUPPORTIVE PARTNER.

484
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:27,100
>> MM-HMM.

485
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,867
>> WHERE IS YOUR SUPPORTIVE

486
00:12:27,867 --> 00:12:29,133
PARTNER?

487
00:12:29,133 --> 00:12:32,367
>> UM...

488
00:12:32,367 --> 00:12:34,900
NOW, IT'S RYAN, BUT AT FIRST,

489
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,800
IT WAS JUST ME.

490
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,800
[laughs]

491
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,367
[exhales]

492
00:12:42,367 --> 00:12:43,067
UM--

493
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:43,700
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

494
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:44,433
I WANT TO TALK TO THAT YOUNG

495
00:12:44,433 --> 00:12:45,333
MAN.

496
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:47,067
WHERE IS HE?

497
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:48,367
>> HE'S HERE.

498
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,267
>> CAN I TALK TO HIM?

499
00:12:49,267 --> 00:12:50,567
>> MM-HMM.

500
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:51,400
>> CAN YOU GET HIM FOR ME?

501
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,833
>> [laughs]

502
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:54,867
RYAN, YOU CAN COME OUT.

503
00:12:54,867 --> 00:12:55,833
[laughter]

504
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:57,800

[audience awws]

508
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,067
[light laughter]

509
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:10,533
>> [sniffles]

510
00:13:10,533 --> 00:13:12,700
>> WHERE WERE YOU?

511
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,300
>> I WASN'T THERE.

512
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:18,633
>> WHAT HAPPENED?

513
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:20,067
>> GOT SCARED.

514
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:20,833
>> YEAH.

515
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:21,700
>> YOU JUST TOOK OFF?

516
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:24,100
>> I MEAN, I WAS THERE, BUT I

517
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,067
WASN'T THERE.

518
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:27,233
I DIDN'T--

519
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:28,267
>> HE WAS THERE IN A SENSE

520
00:13:28,267 --> 00:13:28,967
THAT--

521
00:13:28,967 --> 00:13:29,767
>> DON'T RESCUE HIM.

522
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:30,467
>> I--WELL, I--

523
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:31,267
>> DO NOT RESCUE HIM.

524
00:13:31,267 --> 00:13:31,933
>> I'M NOT GOING TO.

525
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:32,600
>> HANG ON.

526
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,367
>> OKAY.

527
00:13:33,367 --> 00:13:35,067
>> LET'S TAKE A BREAK, BUT DO

528
00:13:35,067 --> 00:13:36,667

>> I'M PISSED OFF.

564
00:14:49,967 --> 00:14:52,133
[laughter]

565
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:55,600
>> HOW COME?

566
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,833
>> BECAUSE IN A WAY,

567
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,067
WHENEVER I FOUND OUT I WAS

568
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,533
PREGNANT, YOU HAVE TO GIVE UP SO

569
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:03,233
MUCH.

570
00:15:03,233 --> 00:15:04,500
YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH

571
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,067
EVERYTHING, AND YOU CAN'T BE

572
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:08,567
WEAK, OR IT WILL KILL YOU.

573
00:15:08,567 --> 00:15:09,900
YOU CAN'T BE WEAK AT ALL.

574
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,633
EVERY PART OF STRENGTH IN YOUR

575
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:12,867
BODY HAS TO COME OUT,

576
00:15:12,867 --> 00:15:15,367
AND IT'S EASIER WHEN YOU'RE

577
00:15:15,367 --> 00:15:16,933
DOING IT WITH SOMEONE,

578
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:19,167
AND I HAD TO BE STRONG BY

579
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:20,967
MYSELF, AND I DIDN'T HAVE

580
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:23,067
ANYBODY TO TALK TO, BECAUSE I

581
00:15:23,067 --> 00:15:24,067
COULDN'T TALK TO MY BEST

582
00:15:24,067 --> 00:15:25,067
FRIENDS, BECAUSE THEY HAD NO

583
00:15:25,067 --> 00:15:26,067
IDEA WHAT I WAS GOING THROUGH.

584
00:15:26,067 --> 00:15:27,067
NOBODY DID.

585
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:30,400
NOBODY KNOWS AT ALL, AND...

586
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,067
>> YOU DIDN'T CARE?

587
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:33,100
>> I WAS JUST ANGRY.

588
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,967
>> ABOUT WHAT?

589
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:34,767
>> I MEAN, I COULDN'T TALK TO

590
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:35,433
HER.

591
00:15:35,433 --> 00:15:36,333
SHE COULDN'T TALK TO ME.

592
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:37,667
I MEAN, WE DIDN'T GET ALONG.

593
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:39,400
IT WAS, LIKE--IT WAS HORRIBLE,

594
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,233
SO, I MEAN, I GUESS I TOOK IT

595
00:15:41,233 --> 00:15:43,733
OUT ON BOTH OF THEM.

596
00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:45,300
>> CAN YOU TRUST HIM NOW?

597
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:48,067
>> MM-HMM.

598
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:49,667
I CAN.

599
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:50,800
>> SHOULD SHE?

600
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,100
>> YEAH.

601
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:54,500
>> HAVE YOU DONE ANYTHING

602
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:58,533
TO HELP HER FEEL MORE

603
00:15:58,533 --> 00:15:59,767
SECURE?

604
00:15:59,767 --> 00:16:01,667
>> [exhales]

605
00:16:01,667 --> 00:16:03,100
SHE'S GOT A RING.

606
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,967
>> SO YOU'RE GONNA GET MARRIED?

607
00:16:03,967 --> 00:16:08,333
>> MM-HMM.

608
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:09,567
[audience awws]

609
00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:10,700
>> OH, MY GOODNESS.

610
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,633
OKAY, I'M GONNA BUST YOUR BALLS

611
00:16:12,633 --> 00:16:13,667
A LITTLE MORE.

612
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:15,167
YOU SAID SOMETHING PRETTY AWFUL

613
00:16:15,167 --> 00:16:16,900
AT ONE POINT, WHICH IS THAT YOU

614
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,733
WOULDN'T BE TOGETHER IF IT

615
00:16:17,733 --> 00:16:19,433
WEREN'T FOR BENTLEY.

616
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:20,633
YOU STILL FEEL THAT WAY?

617
00:16:20,633 --> 00:16:23,600
>> NO, BUT AT THE TIME, I MEAN,

618
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,167
IT WAS JUST--WE JUST ARGUED AND

619
00:16:25,167 --> 00:16:27,367
FOUGHT CONSTANTLY, AND, I MEAN,

620
00:16:27,367 --> 00:16:28,967
THAT WAS--I MEAN, THE ONLY

621
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:32,300
REASON WHY...

622
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,600
>> HE'S SAYING, IF WE HADN'T

623
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,100
HAVE HAD BENTLEY, AND WE FOUGHT

624
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,500
AND ARGUED LIKE THAT, WE WOULD

625
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,233
NOT HAVE BEEN TOGETHER.

626
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:38,133
>> YEAH, WE WOULDN'T HAVE WASTED

627
00:16:38,133 --> 00:16:38,800
THE TIME TRYING.

628
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:39,867
I MEAN, WE WOULD HAVE JUST--

629
00:16:39,867 --> 00:16:41,533
>> RIGHT, BUT--

630
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:42,933
>> WELL, IT'S AN IMPORTANT

631
00:16:42,933 --> 00:16:43,800
POINT, BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING

632
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:44,700
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DO, IS,

633
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:45,367
THEY GO, "SCREW IT.

634
00:16:45,367 --> 00:16:46,067
I'M OUT OF HERE."

635
00:16:46,067 --> 00:16:47,367
BUT YOU STAYED IN, AND YOU

636
00:16:47,367 --> 00:16:49,133
FORGED SOMETHING.

637
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:50,400
YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING GOING NOW,

638
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,233
DON'T YOU?

639
00:16:51,233 --> 00:16:52,667
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

640
00:16:52,667 --> 00:16:53,900
>> I MEAN, WE HAVE EACH OTHER

641
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,633
AND BENTLEY.

642
00:16:55,633 --> 00:16:56,667
>> DO YOU LOVE MACI?

643
00:16:56,667 --> 00:16:57,933
>> OH, YEAH.

644
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:58,600
>> YOU LOVE RYAN?

645
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,733
>> MM-HMM.

646
00:16:59,733 --> 00:17:02,600
>> HAPPY GETTING MARRIED?

647
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,333
>> RYAN.

648
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,733
>> I MEAN, I DIDN'T KNOW WHO YOU

649
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:05,433
WERE ASKING.

650
00:17:05,433 --> 00:17:06,567
>> YOU TOOK AT BEAT THERE, DUDE.

651
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,967
THEY ANSWER IS, "YES, I'M

652
00:17:07,967 --> 00:17:09,800
DELIGHTED."

653
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,767
WE HAVE PAUL IN THE AUDIENCE,

654
00:17:11,767 --> 00:17:12,633
WHO'S GOT A QUESTION FOR US.

655
00:17:12,633 --> 00:17:13,567
PAUL?

656
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:14,700
>> HI, GUYS.

657
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,433
I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU EVER

658
00:17:16,433 --> 00:17:18,633
CONSIDERED ABORTION.

659
00:17:18,633 --> 00:17:20,167
>> MM, THAT'S A HEAVY QUESTION.

660
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:20,900
>> NO.

661
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:21,600
>> NEVER.

662
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,300
>> NOPE.

663
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:22,967
>> RYAN.

664
00:17:22,967 --> 00:17:23,633
>> NO.

665
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:24,333
>> HUH?

666
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,833
>> NO, NEVER.

667
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:26,533
>> WHY NOT?

668
00:17:26,533 --> 00:17:28,133
>> BECAUSE--WHO ARE YOU ASKING?

669
00:17:28,133 --> 00:17:28,867
>> BOTH OF YOU.

670
00:17:28,867 --> 00:17:29,700
WHEN I ASK QUESTIONS, YOU'RE

671
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,567
BOTH ENTITLED TO ANSWER.

672
00:17:30,567 --> 00:17:33,300
WHY NOT?

673
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:36,433
>> IT'S JUST NOT FOR ME.

674
00:17:36,433 --> 00:17:39,600
I--I DON'T KNOW.

675
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,067
I--AS SOON AS I FOUND OUT I WAS

676
00:17:41,067 --> 00:17:42,467
PREGNANT, I DIDN'T CRY.

677
00:17:42,467 --> 00:17:43,900
I DIDN'T FREAK OUT.

678
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:44,967
I WAS JUST LIKE, "YOU KNOW WHAT?

679
00:17:44,967 --> 00:17:45,633
HERE WE GO.

680
00:17:45,633 --> 00:17:46,800
LET'S GO."

681
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,200
ADOPTION OR ABORTION JUST--

682
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,100
>> SO ADOPTION WAS AN OPTION

683
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,533
FOR YOU.

684
00:17:50,533 --> 00:17:52,067
>> THEY'RE OPTIONS, BUT NEITHER

685
00:17:52,067 --> 00:17:54,533
ONE OF THEM WERE OPTIONS FOR ME,

686
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:56,500
NOT FOR--NOT FOR THE SUPPORT I

687
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:58,600
HAD FROM MY FAMILY, AND AT THE

688
00:17:58,600 --> 00:17:59,867
TIME, THE RELATIONSHIP THAT WE

689
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:03,267
DID HAVE, AND IT JUST--WE COULD

690
00:18:03,267 --> 00:18:05,200
DO IT.

691
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,067
>> DID YOU WANT TO GET PREGNANT?

692
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:06,867
>> NO.

693
00:18:06,867 --> 00:18:07,633
>> NO.

694
00:18:07,633 --> 00:18:08,300
>> NO.

695
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:08,967
>> IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

696
00:18:08,967 --> 00:18:10,367
>> YES.

697
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:11,167
>> BUT YOU WERE UP TO THE

698
00:18:11,167 --> 00:18:12,067
CHALLENGE.

699
00:18:12,067 --> 00:18:14,067
>> MM-HMM.

700
00:18:14,067 --> 00:18:14,933
>> OKAY, HAVE YOU GIVEN UP A LOT

701
00:18:14,933 --> 00:18:15,600
TOO, RYAN?

702
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,300
WE'VE HEARD THE MOMS KEEP

703
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,167
TALKING ABOUT HOW MUCH THEY'VE

704
00:18:17,167 --> 00:18:17,833
GIVEN UP.

705
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:18,533
HAVE YOU GIVEN UP A LOT?

706
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:21,567
>> I MEAN...YEAH,

707
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,533
BUT I DON'T THINK I'VE GIVEN UP

708
00:18:23,533 --> 00:18:25,633
AS MUCH AS SHE HAS.

709
00:18:25,633 --> 00:18:26,733
>> I THINK THAT'S THE FIRST TIME

710
00:18:26,733 --> 00:18:30,433
I'VE HEARD YOU SAY THAT.

711
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:31,900
>> WELL, GUYS, MACI AND RYAN,

712
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:32,733

>> THANKS FOR MAKING ME CRY...

716
00:18:36,133 --> 00:18:36,800
>> I BEG YOUR PARDON.

717
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:37,467
>> THE WHOLE TIME.

718
00:18:37,467 --> 00:18:40,600
>> I'M SORRY, BUT IT'S REAL.

719
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:41,300
IT'S IMPORTANT.

720
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,900

PREGNANT BEFORE THEY TURN 20.

750
00:19:44,467 --> 00:19:45,833
WE HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF TEEN

751
00:19:45,833 --> 00:19:47,200
PREGNANCY AMONGST ALL

752
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,833
INDUSTRIALIZED NATIONS,

753
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:49,867
AND ON 16 AND PREGNANT, 

754
00:19:49,867 --> 00:19:51,600
WE MET SIX YOUNG WOMEN WHO

755
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,900
UNEXPECTEDLY BECAME MOMS

756
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:53,567
THEMSELVES.

757
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,133
ONE OF THOSE NEW MOMS IS AMBER

758
00:19:55,133 --> 00:19:56,200
HERE WITH THE MAN IN HER LIFE,

759
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:56,867
GARY.

760
00:19:56,867 --> 00:19:57,900
HI, GUYS.

761
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,600
>> HI.

762
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,833
[applause]

763
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:03,233
>> HOW IS BABY LEAH DOING?

764
00:20:03,233 --> 00:20:04,500
>> SHE'S DOING GREAT.

765
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,400
SHE LOOKS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

766
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,433
THAN WHEN SHE WAS BORN.

767
00:20:07,433 --> 00:20:08,333
>> SHOCKING.

768
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,000
>> OH, YEAH.

769
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,267
SHE'S SO MUCH BIGGER,

770
00:20:10,267 --> 00:20:12,967
AND SHE'S BEEN CRAWLING,

771
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:14,767
AND SHE SAYS "MAMA, DADA,

772
00:20:14,767 --> 00:20:16,000
BABA," AND...

773
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,800
>> SHE HAS FOUR TEETH AND TWO

774
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,467
MORE COMING IN.

775
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:18,167
>> FOUR TEETH.

776
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:18,933
IT'S, LIKE, A LITTLE RABBIT

777
00:20:18,933 --> 00:20:19,633
TEETH.

778
00:20:19,633 --> 00:20:20,733
IT'S SO CUTE.

779
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:21,800
>> BEFORE WE TALK FURTHER,

780
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,100
LET'S REVISIT YOUR EXPERIENCE

781
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:27,667
ON 16 AND PREGNANT. 

782
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:28,833
>> DID YOU JUST BUY THAT?

783
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:29,500
>> YEAH.

784
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:30,700
>> HOW MUCH WAS IT?

785
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,400
>> IT WAS, LIKE,

786
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,133
A COUPLE HUNDRED DOLLARS.

787
00:20:32,133 --> 00:20:32,967
>> THAT'S MONEY WE COULD BE

788
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:34,133
SAVING UP FOR THE BABY.

789
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:35,267
>> GARY, WHEN IT COMES TO

790
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:37,567
PRIORITIES, THE FAMILY'S FIRST.

791
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:38,800
YOUR LITTLE TOYS GOT TO WAIT.

792
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:39,700
>> WHY DID YOU TELL YOUR MOM

793
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,433
ABOUT THE PS3?

794
00:20:40,433 --> 00:20:41,100
YOU SAID YOU WOULDN'T.

795
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:41,833
IT MAKES ME LOOK LIKE AN ASS

796
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:42,500
WHEN I WORKED OVERTIME.

797
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,267
>> BECAUSE YOU ARE AN ASS FOR

798
00:20:43,267 --> 00:20:43,933
DOING IT.

799
00:20:43,933 --> 00:20:44,667
YOU DON'T CARE.

800
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:45,500
>> ABOUT WHAT?

801
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:48,200
>> ABOUT ME.

802
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,000
I WANT A C-SECTION.

803
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,633
>> [crying]

804
00:20:52,633 --> 00:20:53,833
>> DOES SHE COME WITH ANY

805
00:20:53,833 --> 00:20:54,633
INSTRUCTIONS?

806
00:20:54,633 --> 00:20:55,400
>> SHUT UP, GARY.

807
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,967
>> THE DADDY GUIDE. 

808
00:20:56,967 --> 00:20:58,400
I DON'T NEED NO DADDY GUIDE.

809
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,200
>> AT LEAST THEY'RE NOT MARRIED.

810
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,400
>> YEAH, NO KIDDING.

811
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,333
>> I'M GONNA PROPOSE.

812
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,533
>> OOOH.

813
00:21:04,533 --> 00:21:05,900
>> THAT'S $21.40.

814
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,933
>> DO YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR RETURN

815
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:09,367
POLICY ON THEM IS?

816
00:21:09,367 --> 00:21:10,633
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WOULD

817
00:21:10,633 --> 00:21:15,633
MARRY ME.

818
00:21:15,633 --> 00:21:17,600
[laughter]

819
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:21,867
>> SORRY.

820
00:21:21,867 --> 00:21:23,167
>> $21.40?

821
00:21:23,167 --> 00:21:24,767
>> HEY, IT'S THE ONE SHE WANTED.

822
00:21:24,767 --> 00:21:26,767
IT REALLY IS, TRULY, YEAH.

823
00:21:26,767 --> 00:21:27,500
>> YEAH.

824
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:28,800
>> NO, NO, IT WASN'T.

825
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:29,700
WE WERE WALKING AROUND WAL-MART

826
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,067
ONE DAY, AND SHE SAW IT,

827
00:21:31,067 --> 00:21:32,067
AND SHE LIKES REALLY FLASHY

828
00:21:32,067 --> 00:21:34,067
RINGS, AND I HADN'T PLANNED

829
00:21:34,067 --> 00:21:35,267
ON PROPOSING TO HER,

830
00:21:35,267 --> 00:21:36,500
AND THEN, LIKE, AN OPPORTUNITY

831
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,300
PRESENTED ITSELF.

832
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,800
>> GARY.

833
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:39,467
>> WHAT?

834
00:21:39,467 --> 00:21:40,133
>> OKAY, GO AHEAD.

835
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:41,067
>> $21.40 ON THE RING.

836
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:42,067
[laughter]

837
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,967
$400 ON THE--

838
00:21:43,967 --> 00:21:44,633
>> $500.

839
00:21:44,633 --> 00:21:45,400
>> $500 ON THE GAME CONSOLE.

840
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,933
>> TO BE EXACT, IT WAS $480.

841
00:21:46,933 --> 00:21:48,733
>> DUDE, DUDE, WHAT--

842
00:21:48,733 --> 00:21:50,067
PRIORITIES STRAIGHT?

843
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:51,400
>> NO, IT'S JUST I WAS THINKING,

844
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,533
LIKE, IF I WAIT FOR THE

845
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:53,700
FINANCES, LIKE, OKAY, YEAH, I

846
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,267
SHOULD HAVE MAYBE BOUGHT A MORE

847
00:21:55,267 --> 00:21:56,400
EXPENSIVE RING AND MAYBE NOT

848
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,067
BOUGHT THE PS3...

849
00:21:57,067 --> 00:21:57,867
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T

850
00:21:57,867 --> 00:21:58,967
MATTER HOW MUCH THE RING WAS.

851
00:21:58,967 --> 00:22:00,267
>> BUT...BECAUSE I LOVE YOU,

852
00:22:00,267 --> 00:22:01,533
AND THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

853
00:22:01,533 --> 00:22:04,067
I LOVE HER, AND MY...

854
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:09,533
[applause]

855
00:22:09,533 --> 00:22:11,833
MY LOVE GOES FURTHER THAN $21.

856
00:22:11,833 --> 00:22:12,933
>> [laughs]

857
00:22:12,933 --> 00:22:14,333
>> YOU KNOW, IF I COULD--

858
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,200
I'D BUY HER ANYTHING IF I

859
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,400
COULD, BUT...

860
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,067
>> OKAY, THE FACT THAT YOU GOT

861
00:22:19,067 --> 00:22:20,500
PREGNANT AS A TEENAGER,

862
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,333
DOES THAT CHANGE YOUR THINKING

863
00:22:22,333 --> 00:22:23,600
ABOUT CONTRACEPTION AND

864
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,400
UNPROTECTED SEX?

865
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:26,500
>> YEAH, COMPLETELY.

866
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,367
IF WE DON'T HAVE CONDOMS OR

867
00:22:28,367 --> 00:22:30,433
ANYTHING, WE DO NOT HAVE SEX.

868
00:22:30,433 --> 00:22:31,467
>> YEAH.

869
00:22:31,467 --> 00:22:33,833
>> IT'S SO HARD TO BE YOUNG AND

870
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:37,133
HAVE A BABY, BECAUSE YOU DON'T

871
00:22:37,133 --> 00:22:39,067
GET TO DO WHAT YOU USED TO DO.

872
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:39,900
>> I RECOMMEND GETTING THE

873
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,967
INDUSTRIAL-SIZED BOX.

874
00:22:40,967 --> 00:22:41,700
>> HOLD ON.

875
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,067
[laughter]

876
00:22:43,067 --> 00:22:45,333
BUT--BUT THAT MAKES YOU SAD,

877
00:22:45,333 --> 00:22:46,133
RIGHT?

878
00:22:46,133 --> 00:22:47,767
YOU LOST A LOT.

879
00:22:47,767 --> 00:22:49,400
>> IT DOES MAKE ME SAD THAT I

880
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:52,833
DID LOSE SOME OF THE EXPERIENCES

881
00:22:52,833 --> 00:22:54,867
THAT I COULD HAVE HAD.

882
00:22:54,867 --> 00:22:55,667
>> BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T USE A

883
00:22:55,667 --> 00:22:56,333
CONDOM.

884
00:22:56,333 --> 00:22:57,133
>> BECAUSE OF--YES, BECAUSE

885
00:22:57,133 --> 00:22:57,800
OF...

886
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:58,467
>> EVERY TIME.

887
00:22:58,467 --> 00:22:59,133
>> I--FOR SOME REASON--

888
00:22:59,133 --> 00:23:00,067
>> WAS IT JUST ONE TIME, OR WAS

889
00:23:00,067 --> 00:23:00,667
IT--

890
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:02,300
>> NO, WE HADN'T BEEN USING A

891
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,633
CONDOM BASICALLY THE WHOLE TIME.

892
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:04,533
>> WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

893
00:23:04,533 --> 00:23:05,533
>> I DON'T KNOW.

894
00:23:05,533 --> 00:23:06,333
>> WERE YOU TRYING TO GET

895
00:23:06,333 --> 00:23:07,067
PREGNANT?

896
00:23:07,067 --> 00:23:09,433
>> NO, I DON'T--I KNOW IT SOUNDS

897
00:23:09,433 --> 00:23:12,267
SO STUPID, AND IT IS.

898
00:23:12,267 --> 00:23:13,067
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT I WAS

899
00:23:13,067 --> 00:23:13,733
THINKING.

900
00:23:13,733 --> 00:23:14,433
I REALLY DON'T.

901
00:23:14,433 --> 00:23:15,900
AND ONE OF THE THINGS WAS,

902
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,200
WELL, HE DIDN'T FEEL IT.

903
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,333
>> IF WE DIDN'T HAVE A CONDOM,

904
00:23:18,333 --> 00:23:19,067
I WAS LIKE, "LET'S DO IT

905
00:23:19,067 --> 00:23:19,867
ANYWAY," YOU KNOW.

906
00:23:19,867 --> 00:23:21,067
>> YEAH, THAT'S HOW IT WAS.

907
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:22,100
>> HE DIDN'T WHAT?

908
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,167
>> NO, NO.

909
00:23:23,167 --> 00:23:24,067
[laughter]

910
00:23:24,067 --> 00:23:24,733
>> HE DIDN'T FINISH.

911
00:23:24,733 --> 00:23:25,633
IS THAT WHAT YOU SAID?

912
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:27,900
>> NO, HE COULDN'T FEEL.

913
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:28,567
>> OH, YEAH, SO--

914
00:23:28,567 --> 00:23:29,367
>> WHAT?

915
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:30,933
>> YOU KNOW HOW GUYS SAY--

916
00:23:30,933 --> 00:23:31,933
>> NO, IT'S BETTER WITHOUT A

917
00:23:31,933 --> 00:23:32,600
CONDOM.

918
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,500
>> GUYS DON'T LIKE CONDOMS, SOME

919
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,167
GUYS.

920
00:23:34,167 --> 00:23:35,067
>> IT'S NOT--WELL, OBVIOUSLY,

921
00:23:35,067 --> 00:23:35,967
IT'S NOT BETTER IF YOU DON'T

922
00:23:35,967 --> 00:23:36,633
WANT TO GET PREGNANT.

923
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:37,333
I MEAN--

924
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,200
>> WELL, IN THAT FACT, IT AIN'T.

925
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,067
THERE'S--YOU'VE GOT TO LOOK AT

926
00:23:39,067 --> 00:23:39,733
THE DIFFERENT FACTORS.

927
00:23:39,733 --> 00:23:40,567
FOR PLEASURE, IT'S BETTER

928
00:23:40,567 --> 00:23:41,367
WITHOUT A CONDOM.

929
00:23:41,367 --> 00:23:42,400
FOR NOT KEEPING PROTECTION,

930
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,333
IT'S BETTER WITH A CONDOM, SO...

931
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:44,600
>> GARY, NO, DON'T LISTEN TO

932
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,267
THAT.

933
00:23:45,267 --> 00:23:47,833
[laughter]

934
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:50,300
>> BUT--BUT THE "FOR HIS

935
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,100
PLEASURE" COST YOU YOUR

936
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,800
CHILDHOOD AND YOUR YOUTH.

937
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,367
>> I DON'T WANT TO PUT IT ALL ON

938
00:23:55,367 --> 00:23:56,633
HIM, BECAUSE IT WAS MY FAULT

939
00:23:56,633 --> 00:23:57,967
TOO.

940
00:23:57,967 --> 00:23:59,200
I COULD HAVE SAID NO, LIKE WE DO

941
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,067
NOW.

942
00:24:00,067 --> 00:24:01,300
I COULD HAVE SAID, "NO, IF WE

943
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,333
DON'T HAVE SOMETHING, THEN LET'S

944
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:04,300
NOT DO IT," BUT I DIDN'T,

945
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,733
SO IT'S BOTH OF OUR FAULTS,

946
00:24:05,733 --> 00:24:08,367
BUT WE'RE LIVING.

947
00:24:08,367 --> 00:24:09,833
WE'RE DOING A GOOD JOB.

948
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:11,067
I THINK WE'RE GREAT PARENTS.

949
00:24:11,067 --> 00:24:13,067
WE'RE NOT PERFECT.

950
00:24:13,067 --> 00:24:14,567
YOU KNOW, I DON'T REALLY THINK

951
00:24:14,567 --> 00:24:16,967
ANYBODY IS, BUT I THINK WE'RE

952
00:24:16,967 --> 00:24:17,700
GOOD PARENTS.

953
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,200
I DO.

954
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,067
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT OTHER KIDS

955
00:24:20,067 --> 00:24:20,733
TO KNOW ABOUT THIS?

956
00:24:20,733 --> 00:24:22,267
>> I DON'T WANT THEM TO THINK

957
00:24:22,267 --> 00:24:23,567
THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

958
00:24:23,567 --> 00:24:25,700
GLAMORIZE...

959
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,367
>> TEEN PREGNANCY.

960
00:24:26,367 --> 00:24:27,633
>> TEEN PREGNANCIES, 'CAUSE

961
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:29,233
IT'S NOT GLAMOROUS.

962
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:30,600
I THINK THAT THIS SHOW SHOWS ALL

963
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,267
DIFFERENT PEOPLE, ALL DIFFERENT

964
00:24:32,267 --> 00:24:33,900
STORIES, DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS,

965
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:35,067
AND IT SHOULD PORTRAY TO EACH

966
00:24:35,067 --> 00:24:38,300
ONE OF YOU GUYS AND REALLY,

967
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,267
YOU KNOW, IT SHOULD HIT EVERY

968
00:24:39,267 --> 00:24:40,433
ONE OF YOU GUYS A SOFT SPOT

969
00:24:40,433 --> 00:24:42,100
SOMEWHERE, AND, YOU KNOW, SO YOU

970
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:43,100
UNDERSTAND THAT, "YOU KNOW, I

971
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,533
NEED TO WAIT."

972
00:24:44,533 --> 00:24:45,333
>> WELL, THANK YOU, GARY AND

973
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:46,100
AMBER, FOR BEING HERE.

974
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,200
>> THANK YOU.

975
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,900
>> WE WILL HAVE MORE WITH AMBER

976
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,300
DURING THE SPOTLIGHT SESSION,

977
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,333
WHEN ALL THE TEEN MOMS GET A

978
00:24:51,333 --> 00:24:52,600
CHANCE TO FACE EACH OTHER FOR

979
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,800
THE FIRST TIME AND ASK ANYTHING

980
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,500
THEY WANT.

981
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,433
THAT'S GONNA BE INTERESTING,

982
00:24:55,433 --> 00:24:57,067
TO SAY THE LEAST, AND PLUS,

983
00:24:57,067 --> 00:24:58,133
WE'LL HAVE ALL THE BABIES HERE

984
00:24:58,133 --> 00:24:59,433
ON THE STAGE TOGETHER, SO STAY

985
00:24:59,433 --> 00:25:00,500
TUNED FOR THAT.

986
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,833
OH, YES.

987
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,200
WHEN WE RETURN, WE'LL CHECK IN

988
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,100
WITH EBONY AND JOSH.

989
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,300
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN JOSH

990
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,667
WAS--HE WAS LITERALLY KISSING

991
00:25:06,667 --> 00:25:08,467
EBONY'S FEET,

992
00:25:08,467 --> 00:25:10,433
BUT YOU THINK BABY JOCELYN MIGHT

993
00:25:10,433 --> 00:25:11,533
HAVE CHANGED ALL THAT?

994
00:25:11,533 --> 00:25:13,167
STAY TUNED TO FIND OUT.

995
00:25:13,167 --> 00:25:14,767

1001
00:25:28,233 --> 00:25:31,200
>> CAN I HOLD HER?

1002
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,333
>> YOU ALL RIGHT?

1003
00:25:32,333 --> 00:25:33,467
SHOULD WE BRING OUT THE BABIES?

1004
00:25:33,467 --> 00:25:35,433
>> together: YES.

1005
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:49,533

NOW, IN A LITTLE BIT, WE'RE

1013
00:25:59,467 --> 00:26:00,867
GONNA TALK TO CATELYNN AND TYLER

1014
00:26:00,867 --> 00:26:02,167
ABOUT THEIR DECISION TO OPT FOR

1015
00:26:02,167 --> 00:26:04,333
ADOPTION.

1016
00:26:04,333 --> 00:26:05,200

HANG IN FOR THAT.

00:26:29,267 --> 00:26:30,500
25TH.

>> CONGRATULATIONS.

1035
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,833

1036
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:34,700

1041
00:26:37,533 --> 00:26:38,467
YOU UP TO BEING A HUSBAND AND A

>> A WHOLE FAMILY.

1046
00:26:42,467 --> 00:26:43,333
>> THIS WAS A GOOD DECISION, YOU

1047
00:26:43,333 --> 00:26:44,067
THINK?

1048
00:26:44,067 --> 00:26:45,133
>> YEAH, IN THE LONG RUN IT IS,

1049
00:26:45,133 --> 00:26:45,800
YEAH.

1050
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,967
[laughter]

1051
00:26:46,967 --> 00:26:48,833
>> AND, EBONY, HAS JOSH STEPPED

1052
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:50,233
UP AND GROWN UP?

1053
00:26:50,233 --> 00:26:51,400
>> BIG-TIME, BIG-TIME.

1054
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,067
>> OH, REALLY?

1055
00:26:52,067 --> 00:26:52,733
>> HE REALLY HAS, YES.

1056
00:26:52,733 --> 00:26:53,400
>> HAS HE?

1057
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:54,300
TELL ME HOW.

1058
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,567
>> WELL, THE ONLY THING HE

1059
00:26:55,567 --> 00:26:56,767
DOES NOT DO IS, HE DOES NOT

1060
00:26:56,767 --> 00:26:58,433
CHANGE POOPIE DIAPERS, BECAUSE

1061
00:26:58,433 --> 00:27:00,133
SOMETHING SO BEAUTIFUL MAKES

1062
00:27:00,133 --> 00:27:02,833
SOMETHING EXTREMELY STINKY.

1063
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:04,967
I MEAN, THE WORST POOPIE DIAPERS

1064
00:27:04,967 --> 00:27:07,600
YOU EVER SMELLED, SO...YEAH,

1065
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:08,567
WE CAN'T KEEP HER IN AN ENCLOSED

1066
00:27:08,567 --> 00:27:10,967
ROOM.

1067
00:27:10,967 --> 00:27:11,767
>> EVERYTHING ELSE, THOUGH:

1068
00:27:11,767 --> 00:27:12,633
HE'S ON TOP OF THINGS.

1069
00:27:12,633 --> 00:27:13,833
HE'S NOT SLEEPING WHILE HE'S

1070
00:27:13,833 --> 00:27:14,800
TAKING CARE OF THE BABY.

1071
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,667
HE'S ATTENTIVE TO YOU.

1072
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:16,367
HE'S SUPPORTIVE.

1073
00:27:16,367 --> 00:27:17,333
>> YES, HE IS.

1074
00:27:17,333 --> 00:27:19,667
HE IS ALL OF THE ABOVE.

1075
00:27:19,667 --> 00:27:20,600
>> EXCELLENT.

1076
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,133
WELL, BEFORE WE MOVE ON,

1077
00:27:22,133 --> 00:27:23,567
LET'S TAKE A LOOK BACK AT

1078
00:27:23,567 --> 00:27:24,833
EBONY'S EXPERIENCE BEING

1079
00:27:24,833 --> 00:27:29,067
16 AND PREGNANT.

1080
00:27:29,067 --> 00:27:30,400
>> PROM'S IN APRIL.

1081
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:32,067
THE BABY IS DUE IN MAY.

1082
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:35,533
I CAN'T FIT IN THIS DRESS.

1083
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:36,933
>> MAYBE IF HE HAD KEPT IT IN

1084
00:27:36,933 --> 00:27:38,333
HIS PANTS AND NOT KNOCKED

1085
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:39,600
SOMEBODY UP, IT WOULDN'T HAVE

1086
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,967
BEEN THIS WAY.

1087
00:27:40,967 --> 00:27:41,667
>> PUSH.

1088
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:43,233
>> PUSH.

1089
00:27:43,233 --> 00:27:47,367
>> LOOK AT HOW CUTE SHE IS.

1090
00:27:47,367 --> 00:27:48,467
>> [crying] LIKE, I'M JUST THE

1091
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:49,933
ONE THAT GREW UP TOO FAST.

1092
00:27:49,933 --> 00:27:52,267
AND I WANT HIM TO GROW UP TOO.

1093
00:27:52,267 --> 00:27:53,500
SO I HAD TO SACRIFICE GRADUATING

1094
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:56,733
AND GOING INTO THE AIR FORCE.

1095
00:27:56,733 --> 00:27:58,133
YOU'RE HER FATHER, AND YOU NEED

1096
00:27:58,133 --> 00:27:58,800
TO ACT LIKE IT.

1097
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,400
>> I DO ACT LIKE I'M HER FATHER.

1098
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:01,167
WHAT THE [bleep] ARE YOU

1099
00:28:01,167 --> 00:28:02,500
TALKING ABOUT?

1100
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:03,900
I'VE BEEN WORKING MY ASS OFF

1101
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:05,567
JUST TO GRADUATE, AND THEN I

1102
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:06,367
GOT TO WORRY ABOUT

1103
00:28:06,367 --> 00:28:08,067
ENLISTING INTO THE AIR FORCE,

1104
00:28:08,067 --> 00:28:09,100
SO I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO

1105
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:11,600
SEE YOU GUYS THAT MUCH AT ALL.

1106
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,567
SACRIFICES.

1107
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,333
>> JOSH, SOMETHING THAT JUMPS

1108
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:22,067
OUT AT ME, YOUR POOR MOM:

1109
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:23,133
BEEN TALKING TO YOU ABOUT SEX

1110
00:28:23,133 --> 00:28:24,733
SINCE YOU WERE TEN.

1111
00:28:24,733 --> 00:28:26,467
[laughter]

1112
00:28:26,467 --> 00:28:28,400
WH-WH-WH-WHAT?

1113
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,467
HELP ME UNDERSTAND THAT.

1114
00:28:29,467 --> 00:28:31,333
DID SHE NOT MENTION IN ANY OF

1115
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:32,133
THOSE SEX TALKS--SHE DIDN'T

1116
00:28:32,133 --> 00:28:32,833
MENTION CONDOMS?

1117
00:28:32,833 --> 00:28:34,467
>> NO, SHE DID,

1118
00:28:34,467 --> 00:28:37,233
AND I WAS JUST STUPID AND DIDN'T

1119
00:28:37,233 --> 00:28:38,700
LISTEN, I GUESS.

1120
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:39,367
>> YES.

1121
00:28:39,367 --> 00:28:40,933
>> WHOSE IDEA WAS IT TO HAVE SEX

1122
00:28:40,933 --> 00:28:42,433
THE FIRST TIME WITHOUT A CONDOM?

1123
00:28:42,433 --> 00:28:43,400
>> DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?

1124
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,833
>> YEAH, IT WAS PROBABLY JUST

1125
00:28:44,833 --> 00:28:45,867
HEAT OF THE MOMENT.

1126
00:28:45,867 --> 00:28:46,733
>> IT WAS A HEAT-OF-THE-MOMENT

1127
00:28:46,733 --> 00:28:47,433
THING.

1128
00:28:47,433 --> 00:28:49,200
LIKE, YOU'RE JUST--I CAN'T EVEN

1129
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,100
EXPLAIN IT.

1130
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:50,767
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1131
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:52,267
[laughter]

1132
00:28:52,267 --> 00:28:53,667
>> IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

1133
00:28:53,667 --> 00:28:54,533
[laughs]

1134
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:55,467
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT.

1135
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:56,267
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW FOR

1136
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:56,933
CONTRACEPTION?

1137
00:28:56,933 --> 00:28:58,133
>> I'M ON BIRTH CONTROL.

1138
00:28:58,133 --> 00:29:00,067
I HAD A LITTLE SHOT.

1139
00:29:00,067 --> 00:29:00,800
>> DEPO-PROVERA SHOT.

1140
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:01,500
>> YES.

1141
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,700
>> SURE, THAT ONE.

1142
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:03,567
>> YOU'VE MADE SOME HUGE

1143
00:29:03,567 --> 00:29:04,233
SACRIFICES.

1144
00:29:04,233 --> 00:29:05,133
>> YES.

1145
00:29:05,133 --> 00:29:05,800
>> YOU DIDN'T WALK AT

1146
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:06,467
GRADUATION.

1147
00:29:06,467 --> 00:29:07,133
>> NO.

1148
00:29:07,133 --> 00:29:07,833
>> YOU DIDN'T JOIN THE AIR

1149
00:29:07,833 --> 00:29:08,500
FORCE.

1150
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:12,067
>> NO, BUT I HAVE--LIKE, THIS

1151
00:29:12,067 --> 00:29:12,767
IS HOW I SEE IT.

1152
00:29:12,767 --> 00:29:14,533
IF ONE DOOR CLOSES, THEN ANOTHER

1153
00:29:14,533 --> 00:29:16,467
ONE OPENS, AND I CAN'T JOIN THE

1154
00:29:16,467 --> 00:29:17,200
AIR FORCE RIGHT NOW.

1155
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,133
IT'S JUST PUT OFF UNTIL LATER.

1156
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:20,267
I'M GOING TO COLLEGE IN THE

1157
00:29:20,267 --> 00:29:21,867
FALL, AND--

1158
00:29:21,867 --> 00:29:22,800
>> DID YOU GRADUATE?

1159
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,500
>> IT'S A COLLEGE OPTIONS

1160
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,100
PROGRAM, AND YOU FINISH YOUR

1161
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,067
HIGH SCHOOL CREDITS ALONG WITH

1162
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:31,167
THE COLLEGE CREDITS, AND SO IT'S

1163
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:33,067
A THING THAT MY SCHOOL DOES FOR

1164
00:29:33,067 --> 00:29:34,067
ME.

1165
00:29:34,067 --> 00:29:35,067
>> I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

1166
00:29:35,067 --> 00:29:35,933
WHAT'S GOING ON IN YOUR HEAD

1167
00:29:35,933 --> 00:29:36,933
THERE, JOSH, BECAUSE YOU'VE HAD

1168
00:29:36,933 --> 00:29:37,700
TO GIVE UP A LOT TOO.

1169
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,167
>> YEAH, IT IS REAL HARD TO

1170
00:29:39,167 --> 00:29:40,633
LOSE YOUR YOUTH, BECAUSE, I

1171
00:29:40,633 --> 00:29:42,900
MEAN, BEFORE ALL THIS HAPPENED,

1172
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,467
I WAS JUST HAVING A BLAST WITH

1173
00:29:44,467 --> 00:29:47,500
MY LIFE, AND ONCE SHE GOT

1174
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:49,567
PREGNANT, AND AFTER JOCELYN WAS

1175
00:29:49,567 --> 00:29:51,567
BORN, IT TOOK ALL THAT AWAY,

1176
00:29:51,567 --> 00:29:52,933
BECAUSE WE CAN'T DO AS MUCH,

1177
00:29:52,933 --> 00:29:53,967
BECAUSE WE HAVE TO SIT THERE

1178
00:29:53,967 --> 00:29:55,467
WITH HER AND TAKE CARE OF HER,

1179
00:29:55,467 --> 00:29:57,067
SO IT DEFINITELY PUTS A STRAIN,

1180
00:29:57,067 --> 00:29:58,700
BUT I DON'T LOOK AT IT AS IT

1181
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,467
TAKES AWAY MY LIFE.

1182
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:02,400
IT JUST--OR MY LIFE OR MY

1183
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,900
DREAMS--IT JUST PUTS IT ON HOLD

1184
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,100
WHILE I TAKE CARE OF MY

1185
00:30:05,100 --> 00:30:06,433
RESPONSIBILITIES FOR NOW.

1186
00:30:06,433 --> 00:30:07,300
>> DID EBONY HELP BRING YOU

1187
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:08,933
AROUND TO THAT...GENTLY?

1188
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:09,733
>> YEAH, YEAH.

1189
00:30:09,733 --> 00:30:11,667
>> YEAH, GENTLY BUT FIRMLY?

1190
00:30:11,667 --> 00:30:12,533
>> YES.

1191
00:30:12,533 --> 00:30:13,267
>> NOT GENTLY AT ALL.

1192
00:30:13,267 --> 00:30:13,933
JUST--

1193
00:30:13,933 --> 00:30:14,600
>> JUST FIRM.

1194
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:15,267
[laughter]

1195
00:30:15,267 --> 00:30:16,867
>> A MEMBER OF THE AUDIENCE

1196
00:30:16,867 --> 00:30:17,933
NAMED NATIA HAS A QUESTION.

1197
00:30:17,933 --> 00:30:18,600
NATIA?

1198
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,900
>> HEY, EBONY, I JUST WANTED

1199
00:30:20,900 --> 00:30:22,300
TO KNOW WHAT IT WAS REALLY LIKE

1200
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:23,467
GOING TO PROM WHILE BEING

1201
00:30:23,467 --> 00:30:24,467
PREGNANT.

1202
00:30:24,467 --> 00:30:25,167
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1203
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:25,867
IT WAS REALLY FUN.

1204
00:30:25,867 --> 00:30:27,567
I HAD TO SIT DOWN A LOT, BECAUSE

1205
00:30:27,567 --> 00:30:29,533
I WAS FAT, BUT, I MEAN,

1206
00:30:29,533 --> 00:30:32,567
YOU HAVE THIS--I WAS SO HUGE.

1207
00:30:32,567 --> 00:30:33,833
I WAS VERY BIG.

1208
00:30:33,833 --> 00:30:35,733
I MEAN, I STILL DANCED, THOUGH,

1209
00:30:35,733 --> 00:30:36,433
AS YOU GUYS SAW.

1210
00:30:36,433 --> 00:30:38,533
I HAD A BLAST AT PROM.

1211
00:30:38,533 --> 00:30:39,433
>> DO YOU STILL HAVE PLANS TO

1212
00:30:39,433 --> 00:30:40,300
JOIN THE AIR FORCE, JOSH?

1213
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:41,967
>> OH, YES, I'VE BEEN FILLING

1214
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:43,567
OUT THE PAPERWORK RIGHT NOW,

1215
00:30:43,567 --> 00:30:44,733
AND I JUST HAVE TO TURN

1216
00:30:44,733 --> 00:30:46,133
EVERYTHING IN, AND THEY'LL GIVE

1217
00:30:46,133 --> 00:30:48,667
ME MY DATE TO GO IN, SO...

1218
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:49,533
>> I CAN'T STAND BEING AWAY

1219
00:30:49,533 --> 00:30:51,100
FROM HIM, BUT IF I'M FOCUSED ON

1220
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:52,933
SCHOOL WORK, AND THEN HE CALLS

1221
00:30:52,933 --> 00:30:54,733
ME, THEN I'LL BE OKAY, BUT I'LL

1222
00:30:54,733 --> 00:30:56,367
STILL MISS HIM.

1223
00:30:56,367 --> 00:30:58,267
ALL RIGHT, WELL, EXCELLENT.

1224
00:30:58,267 --> 00:30:58,967
THANK YOU, GUYS.

1225
00:30:58,967 --> 00:31:00,200
THANK YOU, EBONY AND JOSH,

1226
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,367
FOR JOINING US, AND

1227
00:31:01,367 --> 00:31:02,900
CONGRATULATIONS ON THE MARRIAGE.

1228
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,833
>> THANK YOU.

1229
00:31:03,833 --> 00:31:05,200
>> LATER, WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM

1230
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,900
YOU AGAIN, BUT FIRST, LET'S STEP

1231
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,967
ASIDE FOR A BREAK, AND THEN

00:31:07,967 --> 00:31:09,067
WE'LL RETURN WITH CATELYNN AND

TYLER.

1234
00:31:10,233 --> 00:31:12,267
NOW, THEY CHOSE ADOPTION FOR

1235
00:31:12,267 --> 00:31:13,767
BABY CARLY, AND WE'VE GOT A HUGE

00:31:13,767 --> 00:31:14,833
SURPRISE IN STORE.

1237
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:15,967
TRUST ME, YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS

1238
00:31:15,967 --> 00:31:17,167
WHAT'S COMING UP NEXT, SO WE'LL

1239
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,633
BE RIGHT BACK.

1240
00:31:18,633 --> 00:31:20,600
[applause]

1241
00:31:37,933 --> 00:31:39,767
>> WELCOME BACK TO 16 AND 

1242
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:41,500
 PREGNANT: LIFE AFTER LABOR, 

1243
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,233
 THE FINALE SPECIAL, 

1244
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:44,567
HOSTED BY ME, DR. DREW.

1245
00:31:44,567 --> 00:31:46,300
NOW, LISTEN, BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

1246
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:49,233
THERE ARE 730,000 TEEN

1247
00:31:49,233 --> 00:31:50,967
PREGNANCIES EVERY YEAR IN

1248
00:31:50,967 --> 00:31:51,767
AMERICA.

1249
00:31:51,767 --> 00:31:53,267
ABOUT HALF OF THOSE PREGNANCIES

1250
00:31:53,267 --> 00:31:54,667
RESULT IN THE BIRTH OF A LIVE

1251
00:31:54,667 --> 00:31:56,967
CHILD, YET ONLY ABOUT 1% OF

1252
00:31:56,967 --> 00:32:00,067
THOSE BABIES ARE ADOPTED, 1%.

1253
00:32:00,067 --> 00:32:01,867
ONE COUPLE THAT KNOWS ALL ABOUT

1254
00:32:01,867 --> 00:32:03,067
THE OPTION TO ADOPT JOINS ME

1255
00:32:03,067 --> 00:32:03,700
NOW.

1256
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:05,100
CATELYNN AND TYLER, WELCOME TO

1257
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:05,767
THE SHOW.

1258
00:32:05,767 --> 00:32:06,400
>> HI.

1259
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:07,100
>> HI.

1260
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:07,767
>> HI, GUYS.

1261
00:32:07,767 --> 00:32:08,667
NOW, YOU GUYS MADE A VERY, VERY

1262
00:32:08,667 --> 00:32:10,700
DIFFICULT DECISION TO OPT FOR

1263
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,200
ADOPTION, AND REALLY, THEY

1264
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,233
AGONIZED OVER IT UNTIL THE VERY

1265
00:32:13,233 --> 00:32:14,300
LAST MINUTE.

1266
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:16,067
LET'S TAKE A LOOK BACK AT

1267
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:17,733
CATELYNN'S PREGNANCY AND THE

1268
00:32:17,733 --> 00:32:18,933
IMPOSSIBLE MOMENTS THAT

1269
00:32:18,933 --> 00:32:23,133
FOLLOWED.

1270
00:32:23,133 --> 00:32:24,233
>> THERE'S SCARY THINGS ABOUT

1271
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:25,067
ADOPTION, BUT, I MEAN, LIKE,

1272
00:32:25,067 --> 00:32:26,167
PARENTING, LIKE, I MEAN,

1273
00:32:26,167 --> 00:32:27,067
THAT'S EVEN SCARIER.

1274
00:32:27,067 --> 00:32:28,067
>> I THINK ADOPTION WOULD BE

1275
00:32:28,067 --> 00:32:29,200
THE BEST OPTION.

1276
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:30,200
>> YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA END UP

1277
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,633
GOING THROUGH WITH IT?

1278
00:32:31,633 --> 00:32:32,867
>> NO, I DON'T AGREE WITH IT.

1279
00:32:32,867 --> 00:32:33,533
YOU CAN CHANGE YOUR MIND

1280
00:32:33,533 --> 00:32:34,200
ANYWAYS.

1281
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:34,867
>> IF I GAVE HER UP FOR

1282
00:32:34,867 --> 00:32:35,633
ADOPTION, LIKE, I HAD GIVEN

1283
00:32:35,633 --> 00:32:36,567
SOMEBODY, LIKE, AN AWESOME GIFT.

1284
00:32:36,567 --> 00:32:37,567
>> AND I KNOW THAT YOU GUYS CAN

1285
00:32:37,567 --> 00:32:38,600
PROVIDE FOR HER A LOT

1286
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:39,733
MORE THAN I CAN.

1287
00:32:39,733 --> 00:32:40,367
I JUST WANT HER TO HAVE

1288
00:32:40,367 --> 00:32:41,267
BETTER THAN WHAT I HAD.

1289
00:32:41,267 --> 00:32:42,533
>> ALL THAT BABY NEEDS IS LOVE.

1290
00:32:42,533 --> 00:32:44,100
>> NO, THAT'S NOT ALL A BABY

1291
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:45,067
NEEDS IS LOVE.

1292
00:32:45,067 --> 00:32:45,867
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ANYTHING

1293
00:32:45,867 --> 00:32:47,133
ABOUT PARENTING.

1294
00:32:47,133 --> 00:32:48,200
>> I WANT YOU TO OPEN YOUR EYES,

1295
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,100
AND I WANT YOU TO LOOK.

1296
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,333
>> I DON'T WANT TO SEE.

1297
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:51,700
>> THERE SHE IS.

1298
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:53,233
>> WE CAN DO THIS.

1299
00:32:53,233 --> 00:32:54,133
>> SHE WANTED TO, UM,

1300
00:32:54,133 --> 00:32:54,800
SEE HER REAL QUICK

1301
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,467
AND JUST HOLD HER AND...

1302
00:32:55,467 --> 00:32:56,667
>> THIS IS NOT AN EASY THING

1303
00:32:56,667 --> 00:32:58,633
TO DO.

1304
00:33:02,067 --> 00:33:03,533
SHE'S JUST REALLY GONE NOW.

1305
00:33:03,533 --> 00:33:05,500
>> YEP.

1306
00:33:10,533 --> 00:33:12,633
>> SORRY.

1307
00:33:12,633 --> 00:33:13,467
>> YOU ALL RIGHT?

1308
00:33:13,467 --> 00:33:14,567
>> YEAH, I'M FINE.

1309
00:33:14,567 --> 00:33:16,100
>> SUCH A COURAGEOUS DECISION,

1310
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,433
BOTH OF YOU.

1311
00:33:17,433 --> 00:33:18,100
>> THANK YOU.

1312
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,433
>> HOW DID YOU DO IT?

1313
00:33:19,433 --> 00:33:20,533
>> UM...

1314
00:33:20,533 --> 00:33:21,600
>> HER.

1315
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,267
>> YEAH, JUST WHEN YOU LOOK AT

1316
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:24,533
HER, LIKE, AND YOU HOLD HER,

1317
00:33:24,533 --> 00:33:25,433
AND YOU JUST KNOW THAT YOU'RE

1318
00:33:25,433 --> 00:33:26,600
DOING IT FOR HER,

1319
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,667
AND IT JUST MADE ME WANT TO DO

1320
00:33:27,667 --> 00:33:29,200
IT 100 TIMES MORE.

1321
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:29,867
JUST HOLDING HER.

1322
00:33:29,867 --> 00:33:31,267
JUST LOOKING AT HER, 'CAUSE, I

1323
00:33:31,267 --> 00:33:32,633
MEAN, THEY'RE SO INNOCENT.

1324
00:33:32,633 --> 00:33:35,200
>> BUT I SAW YOU GET KIND OF

1325
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,133
AMBIVALENT ABOUT IT.

1326
00:33:36,133 --> 00:33:37,200
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO LET HER GO.

1327
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,200
>> WELL, YEAH, I DIDN'T.

1328
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,533
IT WAS REALLY--IT WAS HARD,

1329
00:33:39,533 --> 00:33:41,133
BUT, I MEAN, YOU'VE JUST GO TO--

1330
00:33:41,133 --> 00:33:42,200
YOU'VE GOT TO KIND OF PUSH

1331
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:43,567
YOURSELF, BECAUSE IT'S THE BEST

1332
00:33:43,567 --> 00:33:44,800
THING FOR HER, AND THAT'S ALL

1333
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:45,533
YOU CAN THINK ABOUT IS HER.

1334
00:33:45,533 --> 00:33:46,933
YOU CAN'T THINK ABOUT YOURSELF.

1335
00:33:46,933 --> 00:33:48,233
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW THAT AT 17?

1336
00:33:48,233 --> 00:33:49,433
WHERE DID YOU COME TO THAT--

1337
00:33:49,433 --> 00:33:52,633
>> BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE A KID,

1338
00:33:52,633 --> 00:33:54,433
IT'S NOT--IT'S NOT JUST, "OKAY,

1339
00:33:54,433 --> 00:33:55,100
WELL--

1340
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,067
>> IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU ANYMORE.

1341
00:33:56,067 --> 00:33:56,967
>> IT'S NOT, YOU KNOW--

1342
00:33:56,967 --> 00:33:58,067
>> YEAH, BUT AT 17, EVERYTHING'S

1343
00:33:58,067 --> 00:33:58,933
ABOUT YOU.

1344
00:33:58,933 --> 00:33:59,600
>> I KNOW, BUT--

1345
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,167
>> NO, BUT YOU CAN'T--WHEN YOU

1346
00:34:01,167 --> 00:34:01,967
HAVE A BABY, THAT'S NOT ABOUT

1347
00:34:01,967 --> 00:34:02,633
YOU.

1348
00:34:02,633 --> 00:34:04,400
YOU CAN'T...

1349
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:05,433
>> YOU'VE GOT TO GROW UP.

1350
00:34:05,433 --> 00:34:06,100
>> YEAH.

1351
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:06,800
>> DO YOU UNDERSTAND HOW

1352
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,400
EXTRAORDINARY THAT IS THAT YOU

1353
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,700
GUYS WERE ABLE TO DO THAT?

1354
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,367
>> WELL, I HEAR IT A LOT, BUT...

1355
00:34:11,367 --> 00:34:12,133
[laughter]

1356
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,067
>> IT DIDN'T SEEM EXTRAORDINARY

1357
00:34:13,067 --> 00:34:13,733
TO YOU.

1358
00:34:13,733 --> 00:34:14,567
>> NO, IT DIDN'T.

1359
00:34:14,567 --> 00:34:15,267
>> NO.

1360
00:34:15,267 --> 00:34:16,167
>> IT SEEMED NATURAL.

1361
00:34:16,167 --> 00:34:16,833
>> YEAH.

1362
00:34:16,833 --> 00:34:17,533
>> MM-HMM.

1363
00:34:17,533 --> 00:34:18,500
>> TYLER, I KNOW YOU HAD A LOT

1364
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,967
OF MIXED FEELINGS ABOUT IT,

1365
00:34:19,967 --> 00:34:20,767
AND YOU HAD A FAMILY THAT WAS

1366
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:21,733
TELLING YOU SOMETHING COMPLETELY

1367
00:34:21,733 --> 00:34:22,467
DIFFERENT.

1368
00:34:22,467 --> 00:34:23,333
>> OH, YEAH.

1369
00:34:23,333 --> 00:34:24,867
>> HOW AT 17 DO YOU GET THE--

1370
00:34:24,867 --> 00:34:26,067
DO YOU HAVE THE COURAGE AND THE

1371
00:34:26,067 --> 00:34:26,867
STRENGTH TO STAND UP TO YOUR OWN

1372
00:34:26,867 --> 00:34:27,567
FAMILY?

1373
00:34:27,567 --> 00:34:28,900
>> MY DAUGHTER.

1374
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,067
SHE GAVE ME THE STRENGTH,

1375
00:34:31,067 --> 00:34:31,733
THE COURAGE.

1376
00:34:31,733 --> 00:34:32,533
>> I TOLD YOU YOU GUYS TAKE MY

1377
00:34:32,533 --> 00:34:33,467
BREATH AWAY, YOUR STRENGTH AND

1378
00:34:33,467 --> 00:34:34,200
YOUR COURAGE.

1379
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,933
I MEAN, IT'S JUST INCREDIBLY

1380
00:34:35,933 --> 00:34:36,733
DIFFICULT WHAT YOU'VE DONE.

1381
00:34:36,733 --> 00:34:38,067
>> YEAH, IT'S NOT EASY.

1382
00:34:38,067 --> 00:34:39,100
>> IT'S THE HARDEST THING.

1383
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,267
>> YEAH, IT'S THE HARDEST THING

1384
00:34:40,267 --> 00:34:41,067
I'VE EVER DONE IN MY LIFE.

1385
00:34:41,067 --> 00:34:42,700
>> AND YET IT'S THE RIGHT

1386
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:44,233
THING...

1387
00:34:44,233 --> 00:34:44,900
>> YEAH.

1388
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,633
>> FOR YOUR DAUGHTER, FOR CARLY.

1389
00:34:46,633 --> 00:34:47,300
>> YEAH.

1390
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:48,067
>> CARLY'S HER NAME, RIGHT?

1391
00:34:48,067 --> 00:34:48,733
>> YEAH.

1392
00:34:48,733 --> 00:34:49,667
>> YOU'VE GIVEN CARLY--WHAT HAVE

1393
00:34:49,667 --> 00:34:50,467
YOU GIVEN HER AS A RESULT OF

1394
00:34:50,467 --> 00:34:51,133
YOUR SACRIFICE?

1395
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:51,800
>> OH, MY GOSH.

1396
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:52,700
>> A CHANCE AT LIFE...

1397
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:54,067
>> A CHANCE, YEAH, AWESOME

1398
00:34:54,067 --> 00:34:57,367
PARENTS, A BEAUTIFUL HOME,

1399
00:34:57,367 --> 00:34:59,367
A BEAUTIFUL FAMILY, HUGE FAMILY.

1400
00:34:59,367 --> 00:35:01,133
THAT--SHE IS SURROUNDED BY

1401
00:35:01,133 --> 00:35:02,667
SO MUCH LOVE, IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

1402
00:35:02,667 --> 00:35:04,967
>> WHAT DID YOU HAVE GROWING UP?

1403
00:35:04,967 --> 00:35:06,667
>> A SINGLE MOM, MOVING ALL

1404
00:35:06,667 --> 00:35:08,067
THE TIME.

1405
00:35:08,067 --> 00:35:09,367
>> WAS SHE A TEEN PARENT TOO?

1406
00:35:09,367 --> 00:35:10,500
>> WELL, SHE, I MEAN, SHE WAS

1407
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:11,433
19, BUT THAT'S--

1408
00:35:11,433 --> 00:35:12,433
>> NINE..."TEEN."

1409
00:35:12,433 --> 00:35:15,367
>> YEAH, AND MOVING ALL THE

1410
00:35:15,367 --> 00:35:17,233
TIME AND JUST--IT WASN'T--

1411
00:35:17,233 --> 00:35:18,300
I MEAN, I'M NOT GONNA SAY IT WAS

1412
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,100
BAD, 'CAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE A

1413
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,667
HORRIBLE LIFE, BUT, I MEAN, IT

1414
00:35:20,667 --> 00:35:22,533
COULD HAVE BEEN BETTER, SO...

1415
00:35:22,533 --> 00:35:23,400
>> YOU CERTAINLY WANTED BETTER

1416
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,067
FOR YOUR CHILD.

1417
00:35:24,067 --> 00:35:25,733
>> YEAH, I DIDN'T WANT HER TO

1418
00:35:25,733 --> 00:35:26,867
HAVE WHAT WE HAD.

1419
00:35:26,867 --> 00:35:29,200
>> YEAH, WE WANTED MORE.

1420
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:29,867
>> YEAH.

1421
00:35:29,867 --> 00:35:30,600
>> WHAT WOULD YOU TELL KIDS

1422
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,567
THAT THINK TO THEMSELVES, "WELL,

1423
00:35:31,567 --> 00:35:32,400
I'M NOT GONNA LET MY KID HAVE

1424
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,400
WHAT I HAD.

1425
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,067
I'M GONNA DO A BETTER JOB,

1426
00:35:35,067 --> 00:35:36,700
AND I'M GONNA RAISE THEM"?

1427
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,233
AND IT'S REALLY THE SAME STUFF

1428
00:35:38,233 --> 00:35:39,667
YOUR DAD WAS TELLING YOU.

1429
00:35:39,667 --> 00:35:41,467
>> WELL, I MEAN, YOU CAN DO IT.

1430
00:35:41,467 --> 00:35:42,667
LIKE, YOU REALLY CAN DO IT,

1431
00:35:42,667 --> 00:35:44,600
BUT, I MEAN...

1432
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,333
>> AT WHAT COST?

1433
00:35:45,333 --> 00:35:46,867
>> YEAH, EXACTLY, AT WHAT COST?

1434
00:35:46,867 --> 00:35:48,133
>> YOU KNOW, WHAT--THE KIND OF

1435
00:35:48,133 --> 00:35:49,067
LIFE THAT YOUR CHILD IS GONNA

1436
00:35:49,067 --> 00:35:51,267
LIVE, OR, YOU KNOW,

1437
00:35:51,267 --> 00:35:52,533
NOBODY CAN REALLY PREDICT THE

1438
00:35:52,533 --> 00:35:53,800
FUTURE, BUT--

1439
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:54,567
>> YOU CAN SAY THAT YOU'RE

1440
00:35:54,567 --> 00:35:55,500
GONNA BE A GOOD MOM, AND YOU'RE

1441
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,367
GONNA DO THIS, AND YOU'RE GONNA

1442
00:35:56,367 --> 00:35:57,300
DO THAT, BUT, I MEAN, AFTER A

1443
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,667
YEAR, IT GETS OLD.

1444
00:35:58,667 --> 00:35:59,633
>> HOW DO YOU FEEL NOW SEEING

1445
00:35:59,633 --> 00:36:00,733
ALL THE OTHER MOMS WITH THEIR

1446
00:36:00,733 --> 00:36:01,500
BABIES?

1447
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:04,067
>> WELL, UM...I DON'T KNOW.

1448
00:36:04,067 --> 00:36:06,067
SOMETIMES I THINK, LIKE...

1449
00:36:06,067 --> 00:36:06,900
>> WE COULD HAVE DONE IT.

1450
00:36:06,900 --> 00:36:08,300
>> YEAH, I THINK THAT WE COULD

1451
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,767
HAVE DONE IT, AND, YOU KNOW,

1452
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:11,133
'CAUSE, LIKE, YOU SEE WITH ALL

1453
00:36:11,133 --> 00:36:12,167
OF THEM, THEY'RE JUST, LIKE,

1454
00:36:12,167 --> 00:36:13,067
EVERYBODY'S OOHING AN AHHING

1455
00:36:13,067 --> 00:36:14,367
ALL OVER THEM, AND WE DON'T HAVE

1456
00:36:14,367 --> 00:36:16,333
NOTHING, AND IT'S LIKE, "OKAY,"

1457
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:17,067
BUT THEN YOU'VE GOT TO STOP

1458
00:36:17,067 --> 00:36:18,100
YOURSELF, AND YOU'VE GOT TO BE

1459
00:36:18,100 --> 00:36:19,500
LIKE, "NO, THIS IS WHY WE DID

1460
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,433
IT, YOU KNOW.

1461
00:36:20,433 --> 00:36:21,567
IT'S NOT ABOUT US.

1462
00:36:21,567 --> 00:36:22,433
IT'S ABOUT HER."

1463
00:36:22,433 --> 00:36:24,100
SO YOU'VE GOT TO JUST THINK

1464
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,367
ABOUT HER, NOT YOURSELF.

1465
00:36:25,367 --> 00:36:26,667
>> I FEEL SO PASSIONATELY THAT

1466
00:36:26,667 --> 00:36:27,633
PEOPLE LIKE YOU NEED TO BE

1467
00:36:27,633 --> 00:36:30,067
HONORED AND...BECAUSE IT JUST--

1468
00:36:30,067 --> 00:36:32,200
IT'S SO DIFFICULT.

1469
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,200
ALL RIGHT, WELL, LET'S STEP

1470
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,300
ASIDE FOR A BREAK, AND THEN

1471
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,367
WE'VE GOT A HUGE SURPRISE IN

1472
00:36:35,367 --> 00:36:36,233
STORE.

1473
00:36:36,233 --> 00:36:37,100
TRUST ME, YOU DON'T WANT TO MISS

1474
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,067
WHAT'S COMING UP NEXT, SO

1475
00:36:38,067 --> 00:36:39,367
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

1476
00:36:39,367 --> 00:36:42,900
[applause]

1477
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:43,933
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE

1478
00:36:43,933 --> 00:36:44,733
YOU'VE SEEN CARLY?

1479
00:36:44,733 --> 00:36:45,800

[laughter]

1665
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,633
SHE DOESN'T--SHE'S JUST, LIKE...

1666
00:41:27,633 --> 00:41:28,567
>> TYLER, YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO

1667
00:41:28,567 --> 00:41:29,367
PUSH HER HAIR DOWN, NOT PUT IT

1668
00:41:29,367 --> 00:41:30,067
UP.

1669
00:41:30,067 --> 00:41:30,767
>> WELL, I LIKE IT UP.

1670
00:41:30,767 --> 00:41:34,167
>> SHE LIKES HER LITTLE MOHAWK.

1671
00:41:34,167 --> 00:41:36,600

00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,667
SO DON'T GO AWAY.

00:41:39,667 --> 00:41:41,633
[applause]

1675
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,667
>> WELCOME BACK TO LIFE AFTER

00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,933
TERESA'S GOT CARLY RIGHT NOW,

1686
00:42:27,933 --> 00:42:29,167
BEAUTIFUL.

1687
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:29,833
>> THANK YOU.

1688
00:42:29,833 --> 00:42:32,067

HELP US UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT IS.

1692
00:42:37,133 --> 00:42:39,067

00:42:39,067 --> 00:42:41,233
ADOPTIONS THAT PEOPLE THINK OF

1694
00:42:41,233 --> 00:42:42,267
ARE REALLY RARE THESE DAYS,

1695
00:42:42,267 --> 00:42:44,067
SO WITH A SEMI-OPEN ADOPTION,

1696
00:42:44,067 --> 00:42:45,100
BIRTH PARENTS HAVE AN

ADOPTIVE PARENTS, AS CATELYNN

1699
00:42:48,633 --> 00:42:51,067
AND TYLER LOOKED AT PROFILES AND

1700
00:42:51,067 --> 00:42:53,600
CHOSE US, AND THEN BIRTH PARENTS

1701
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,100
ALONG WITH THE ADOPTIVE PARENTS

1702
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:56,900
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO KIND OF

1703
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,333
DECIDE WHAT THEIR RELATIONSHIP'S

1704
00:42:58,333 --> 00:43:00,133
GONNA LOOK LIKE GOING FORWARD.

1705
00:43:00,133 --> 00:43:01,233
>> WE CAN'T TALK ABOUT HER

1706
00:43:01,233 --> 00:43:02,200
WITHOUT TALKING ABOUT YOU ALL,

1707
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:02,967
SO...

1708
00:43:02,967 --> 00:43:03,667
[laughter]

1709
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:05,067
EVERYBODY HEARS ABOUT YOU ALL

1710
00:43:05,067 --> 00:43:06,200
AND THE BRAVE DECISION YOU MADE

1711
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:07,500
AND OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU

1712
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,633
EVERY TIME THEY ASK ABOUT CARLY.

1713
00:43:09,633 --> 00:43:10,300
>> YEAH.

1714
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,133
>> WE LOVE TO TELL THEM ABOUT

1715
00:43:11,133 --> 00:43:13,400
YOU.

1716
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:14,867
>> AND I ALSO MISSED--I DIDN'T

1717
00:43:14,867 --> 00:43:16,067
REALLY HEAR--I HEARD HOW YOU

1718
00:43:16,067 --> 00:43:17,333
FELT ABOUT THESE TWO WHEN YOU

00:43:17,333 --> 00:43:19,600
WERE LOOKING AT THEIR PICTURES,

1720
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:20,600
BUT I DIDN'T HEAR EITHER OF YOU

1721
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:22,167
TELL THEM.

1722
00:43:22,167 --> 00:43:23,300
>> WHAT I THINK ABOUT THEM?

1723
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:24,133
>> YEAH, THE PARENTS.

1724
00:43:24,133 --> 00:43:25,667
>> I ABSOLUTELY LOVE YOU GUYS.

1725
00:43:25,667 --> 00:43:26,333
>> WONDERFUL.

1726
00:43:26,333 --> 00:43:27,933
>> SERIOUSLY, YOU GUYS ARE,

1727
00:43:27,933 --> 00:43:28,867
LIKE, SERIOUSLY, LIKE, A SECOND

1728
00:43:28,867 --> 00:43:29,867
FAMILY TO ME.

00:43:29,867 --> 00:43:31,633
I MEAN, 'CAUSE--AND IT'S JUST

1730
00:43:31,633 --> 00:43:32,967
AMAZING, LIKE, EVEN HOW YOU

1731
00:43:32,967 --> 00:43:34,300
LEFT ME THAT MESSAGE YESTERDAY,

1732
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:35,367
AND YOU WERE LIKE, "WE'RE

1733
00:43:35,367 --> 00:43:36,733
ETERNALLY GRATEFUL FOR YOU, AND

WE LOVE YOU," AND IT'S JUST,

1735
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:39,933
LIKE, EVERY TIME I TALK TO YOU

1736
00:43:39,933 --> 00:43:44,933

00:43:44,933 --> 00:43:45,733
BRING ME UP MORE AND MORE.

THEY'RE JUST--AND BOTH, LIKE,

1740
00:43:50,533 --> 00:43:51,233
SHE'S STILL HERE.

1741
00:43:51,233 --> 00:43:52,400
YOU GUYS ARE TAKING GREAT CARE

1742
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,300
OF HER, AND YOU LOVE HER, AND...

1743
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:56,533
>> SHE WOULDN'T HAVE HAD SUCH

1744
00:43:56,533 --> 00:43:58,233
GOOD PARENTS, YOU KNOW, IF IT

1745
00:43:58,233 --> 00:44:00,600
WASN'T FOR YOU GUYS.

1746
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:01,567
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT THESE

1747
00:44:01,567 --> 00:44:02,900
TWO, TERESA?

1748
00:44:02,900 --> 00:44:05,433
>> WE HAVE JUST SO LONGED FOR

1749
00:44:05,433 --> 00:44:07,600
THIS BABY, AND IT'S THE MOST

1750
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:09,233
INCREDIBLE GIFT THAT ANYBODY

1751
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:10,867
COULD EVER GIVE US, AND, YOU

1752
00:44:10,867 --> 00:44:11,933
KNOW, LIKE I SAY, I DON'T KNOW

1753
00:44:11,933 --> 00:44:12,867
IF I'LL EVER BE ABLE TO TELL YOU

1754
00:44:12,867 --> 00:44:14,833
ENOUGH HOW MUCH WE LOVE YOU

1755
00:44:14,833 --> 00:44:19,733
AND HOW GRATEFUL WE ARE THAT YOU

1756
00:44:19,733 --> 00:44:21,667
MADE SUCH A HARD AND BRAVE

1757
00:44:21,667 --> 00:44:24,800
DECISION, AND WHAT WE JUST LOVE

1758
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:27,200
ABOUT BOTH OF YOU GUYS IS THAT

1759
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:28,933
CARLY IS GONNA GROW UP KNOWING

1760
00:44:28,933 --> 00:44:30,800
THAT YOU MADE THIS DECISION

1761
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,433
BECAUSE YOU LOVED HER AND

1762
00:44:32,433 --> 00:44:37,267
BECAUSE YOU WANTED A BETTER LIFE

1763
00:44:37,267 --> 00:44:39,633
FOR HER, AND SHE IS SWEET AND

1764
00:44:39,633 --> 00:44:42,300
WONDERFUL AND--AND JUST HAS SO

1765
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:43,767
MUCH OF BOTH OF YOU GUYS IN HER

1766
00:44:43,767 --> 00:44:44,933
ALREADY, AND WE LOOK, AND WE

00:44:44,933 --> 00:44:46,200
DEBATE ON WHO SHE LOOKS LIKE

1768
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,333
AND WHO SHE'S GONNA BE LIKE,

1769
00:44:47,333 --> 00:44:50,367
AND IT'S JUST A PRECIOUS GIFT.

1770
00:44:50,367 --> 00:44:51,967
>> IF IT WASN'T FOR YOU GUYS,

1771
00:44:51,967 --> 00:44:53,500
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE WOULD HAVE

1772
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,767
BEEN ABLE TO DO THIS.

1773
00:44:55,767 --> 00:44:57,467
>> OR HOW WE'D BE RIGHT NOW

1774
00:44:57,467 --> 00:44:58,200
EITHER.

1775
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,700
>> I DON'T--YOU KNOW, I CAN'T

1776
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,833
PICTURE HER WITH ANYBODY--ANY

1777
00:45:00,833 --> 00:45:02,067
OTHER FAMILY BESIDES YOU GUYS.

1778
00:45:02,067 --> 00:45:03,900
YOU GUYS ARE PERFECT.

1779
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:04,867
>> YOU'RE EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE

1780
00:45:04,867 --> 00:45:05,533
WANTED.

1781
00:45:05,533 --> 00:45:09,067
>> EVERYTHING THAT WE'VE WANTED.

1782
00:45:09,067 --> 00:45:10,467
YOU KNOW, IT JUST SEEMED LIKE

1783
00:45:10,467 --> 00:45:13,733
THE MOST PERFECT MATCH.

1784
00:45:13,733 --> 00:45:16,400
>> WE'VE GOT QUESTIONS FROM AN

1785
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,700
AUDIENCE MEMBER.

1786
00:45:17,700 --> 00:45:18,700
IS SOMEBODY NAMED ERIN OUT

1787
00:45:18,700 --> 00:45:19,367
THERE?

1788
00:45:19,367 --> 00:45:20,100
ERIN, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT FOR

1789
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:20,767
THESE GUYS?

1790
00:45:20,767 --> 00:45:21,467
>> HI, GUYS.

1791
00:45:21,467 --> 00:45:22,267
I JUST WANTED TO KNOW WHAT

1792
00:45:22,267 --> 00:45:23,433
ADVICE YOU WOULD GIVE TO YOUNG

1793
00:45:23,433 --> 00:45:24,300
PARENTS WHO ARE ALREADY IN THE

1794
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:26,067
ADOPTION PROCESS.

1795
00:45:26,067 --> 00:45:28,300
>> DEFINITELY, IF YOU DON'T HAVE

1796
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:29,367
A SUPPORTIVE FAMILY, LIKE I

1797
00:45:29,367 --> 00:45:31,067
DIDN'T, I WOULD DEFINITELY GET

1798
00:45:31,067 --> 00:45:32,500
SOME COUNSELING, BECAUSE IT'S

1799
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:33,833
NOT EASY.

1800
00:45:33,833 --> 00:45:35,067
IT'S REALLY NOT EASY, BUT YOU

1801
00:45:35,067 --> 00:45:37,067
JUST HAVE TO--THE WHOLE TIME

1802
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:37,867
YOU'RE GOING THROUGH IT, YOU

1803
00:45:37,867 --> 00:45:38,533
HAVE TO KNOW.

1804
00:45:38,533 --> 00:45:39,433
YOU HAVE TO, LIKE, PREPARE

1805
00:45:39,433 --> 00:45:40,900
YOURSELF FOR THAT DAY WHEN YOU

1806
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,067
HAVE TO, LIKE, HAND YOUR CHILD

1807
00:45:42,067 --> 00:45:43,167
OFF, BECAUSE IF YOU DON'T,

1808
00:45:43,167 --> 00:45:44,067
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO DO

1809
00:45:44,067 --> 00:45:44,667
IT.

1810
00:45:44,667 --> 00:45:45,900
THAT'S WHAT HELPED ME OUT A LOT,

1811
00:45:45,900 --> 00:45:46,767
BECAUSE, I MEAN, IT GAVE ME A

1812
00:45:46,767 --> 00:45:47,867
LOT OF STRENGTH, SO...

1813
00:45:47,867 --> 00:45:48,600
>> AND WHILE YOU'RE GOING

1814
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,467
THROUGH THE ADOPTION PROCESS,

1815
00:45:49,467 --> 00:45:51,067
JUST CONSTANTLY THINK ABOUT YOUR

1816
00:45:51,067 --> 00:45:51,667
BABY...

1817
00:45:51,667 --> 00:45:52,500
>> YOU'VE GOT TO THINK ABOUT

1818
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:53,933
HER, YEAH.

1819
00:45:53,933 --> 00:45:55,267
>> AND NOBODY ELSE.

1820
00:45:55,267 --> 00:45:56,633
>> RACHEL, WHERE ARE YOU?

1821
00:45:56,633 --> 00:45:57,867
YOU'VE GOT A QUESTION.

1822
00:45:57,867 --> 00:45:59,333
>> THIS QUESTION'S FOR BRANDON

1823
00:45:59,333 --> 00:46:01,500
AND TERESA.

1824
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:02,933
WHAT WAS IT LIKE MEETING

1825
00:46:02,933 --> 00:46:04,167
CATELYNN AND TYLER FOR THE FIRST

1826
00:46:04,167 --> 00:46:05,300
TIME?

1827
00:46:05,300 --> 00:46:06,200
>> WELL, MEETING THEM FOR THE

1828
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:09,067
FIRST TIME WAS NERVE-RACKING,

1829
00:46:09,067 --> 00:46:09,867
BUT THE MOMENT THEY KIND OF

1830
00:46:09,867 --> 00:46:10,967
WALKED IN THE DOOR, IT WAS,

1831
00:46:10,967 --> 00:46:12,067
YOU KNOW, IT WAS PRETTY AMAZING.

1832
00:46:12,067 --> 00:46:12,900
I MEAN, WE JUST FELT LIKE WE

1833
00:46:12,900 --> 00:46:14,100
KIND OF MADE THIS CONNECTION

1834
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:15,900
WITH YOU ALL, AND, BUT YEAH, WE

1835
00:46:15,900 --> 00:46:17,400
JUST FELT LIKE, AS WE SAID, I

1836
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:18,300
MEAN, THERE'S KIND OF ALWAYS

1837
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,333
THIS LITTLE BIT IN THE BACK OF

1838
00:46:20,333 --> 00:46:21,133
OUR HEADS OR OUR MINDS THAT WE

1839
00:46:21,133 --> 00:46:22,067
KNEW THAT YOU COULD CHANGE YOUR

1840
00:46:22,067 --> 00:46:22,733
MIND.

1841
00:46:22,733 --> 00:46:23,700
AGAIN, YOU ALL DID A GREAT JOB

1842
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:24,733
OF REASSURING US.

1843
00:46:24,733 --> 00:46:26,100
I MEAN, YOU WERE COUNSELING US

1844
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:27,567
IN A SENSE ABOUT, "NO, NO, CALM

1845
00:46:27,567 --> 00:46:28,833
DOWN.

1846
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:29,667
IT'S OKAY."

1847
00:46:29,667 --> 00:46:30,333
>> I WAS LIKE, "DON'T BE

1848
00:46:30,333 --> 00:46:31,067
AFRAID."

1849
00:46:31,067 --> 00:46:32,467
>> YEAH, YOU WERE GOOD AT THAT.

1850
00:46:32,467 --> 00:46:33,533
SO THERE WAS ALWAYS THIS LITTLE

1851
00:46:33,533 --> 00:46:35,067
BIT OF, YOU KNOW, CONCERN IN THE

1852
00:46:35,067 --> 00:46:35,967
BACK OF OUR MINDS, BUT WE KIND

1853
00:46:35,967 --> 00:46:36,967
OF JUST DECIDED EARLY ON,

1854
00:46:36,967 --> 00:46:39,100
IF WE'RE HOLDING BACK, THAT'S

1855
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,267
GONNA SHOW THROUGH.

1856
00:46:40,267 --> 00:46:40,933
WE'RE GONNA FEEL IT.

1857
00:46:40,933 --> 00:46:41,933
THEY'RE GONNA NOTICE IT,

1858
00:46:41,933 --> 00:46:42,900
AND THAT CAN'T BE THE WAY IT IS.

1859
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:44,200
WE JUST KIND OF HAVE TO GO

1860
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,100
FORWARD AND PUT YOURSELF OUT

1861
00:46:45,100 --> 00:46:47,667
THERE AND JUST, YOU KNOW, GO

1862
00:46:47,667 --> 00:46:49,867
FOR IT AND JUST BELIEVE THAT

1863
00:46:49,867 --> 00:46:51,700
IT'S GONNA MOVE THROUGH.

1864
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:52,400
>> WE'VE GOT AMANDA IN

1865
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,200
THE AUDIENCE.

1866
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:54,333
SHE HAS A QUESTION.

1867
00:46:54,333 --> 00:46:56,367
>> I KNOW THAT BOTH YOUR PARENTS

1868
00:46:56,367 --> 00:46:57,533
HAD ISSUES WITH YOUR DECISION

1869
00:46:57,533 --> 00:46:59,067
FOR ADOPTION.

1870
00:46:59,067 --> 00:47:00,200
I WAS WONDERING HOW THEY'RE

1871
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,400
DEALING WITH IT NOW.

1872
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:03,100
>> MY MOM'S WARMING UP TO IT A

1873
00:47:03,100 --> 00:47:04,600
LOT MORE NOW, 'CAUSE SHE

1874
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:05,700
MISSES ME, 'CAUSE I HAVEN'T BEEN

1875
00:47:05,700 --> 00:47:07,967
HOME IN, LIKE, SEVEN WEEKS.

1876
00:47:07,967 --> 00:47:09,533
>> WHERE ARE YOU LIVING?

1877
00:47:09,533 --> 00:47:10,800
>> I'VE BEEN STAYING AT TYLER'S.

1878
00:47:10,800 --> 00:47:11,567
>> WHAT HAPPENED?

1879
00:47:11,567 --> 00:47:12,767
>> YEAH, WHAT, STAYING IN MY

1880
00:47:12,767 --> 00:47:14,267
HOUSEHOLD WITH DRUNKS AND LOUD

1881
00:47:14,267 --> 00:47:16,200
MUSIC AND PARTYING?

1882
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,433
NO, NO THANKS.

1883
00:47:17,433 --> 00:47:18,700
>> AND YOU WERE EXPOSED TO ALL

1884
00:47:18,700 --> 00:47:19,400
THAT, THOUGH.

1885
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,267
>> OH, YEAH.

1886
00:47:20,267 --> 00:47:21,200
>> YOU KNOW, THE FUNNY THING

1887
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,067
HUMANS DO IS, THEY USUALLY

1888
00:47:22,067 --> 00:47:23,167
RE-CREATE THE THING THAT WERE

1889
00:47:23,167 --> 00:47:24,267
PROBLEMATIC IN THEIR PAST.

1890
00:47:24,267 --> 00:47:25,300
THEY USUALLY DON'T KNOW TO BREAK

1891
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:25,967
THE CYCLE.

1892
00:47:25,967 --> 00:47:26,667
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

1893
00:47:26,667 --> 00:47:28,067
>> WELL, MY WHOLE LIFE, I'VE

1894
00:47:28,067 --> 00:47:29,433
BEEN ALWAYS WATCHING OVER MY

1895
00:47:29,433 --> 00:47:32,767
MOM AND PRACTICALLY RAISING

1896
00:47:32,767 --> 00:47:33,800

00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,133
BY--LIKE, PRACTICALLY RAISING

1898
00:47:35,133 --> 00:47:36,767
HIM, LIKE, HIS WHOLE LIFE,

1899
00:47:36,767 --> 00:47:37,800
EVEN THOUGH HE'S ONLY TWO, BUT

1900
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:40,567
STILL, SO I'VE SEEN A LOT OF

1901
00:47:40,567 --> 00:47:41,733
STUFF, AND I JUST THINK IT MAKES

1902
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:43,367
YOU GROW UP REALLY FAST.

1903
00:47:43,367 --> 00:47:45,533
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY PARTING

1904
00:47:45,533 --> 00:47:46,700
MESSAGES FOR CARLY OR TERESA OR

1905
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,367
BRANDON?

1906
00:47:48,367 --> 00:47:49,433
>> I'M GONNA MISS HER, BUT WE

1907
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:50,733
ALWAYS SAY THAT IT'S NOT A

1908
00:47:50,733 --> 00:47:51,400
GOOD-BYE.

1909
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:52,067
IT'S A SEE YOU LATER.

1910
00:47:52,067 --> 00:47:52,767
>> SEE YOU LATER.

1911
00:47:52,767 --> 00:47:53,433
>> RIGHT?

1912
00:47:53,433 --> 00:47:54,500
>> SEE YOU LATER...

1913
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,267
>> EXACTLY.

1914
00:47:55,267 --> 00:47:56,067
>> TILL NEXT TIME.

1915
00:47:56,067 --> 00:47:58,333
>> YEP, SEE YOU LATER.

1916
00:47:58,333 --> 00:47:59,767
>> WELL, THIS IS CLEARLY AN

1917
00:47:59,767 --> 00:48:01,467
EMOTIONAL DAY FOR THE FOUR OF

1918
00:48:01,467 --> 00:48:02,600
YOU, AND WE THANK YOU ALL FOR

1919
00:48:02,600 --> 00:48:03,367
BEING HERE.

1920
00:48:03,367 --> 00:48:04,800
LET'S STEP ASIDE FOR A BREAK,

1921
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:05,767
AND THEN WE'LL RETURN WITH

1922
00:48:05,767 --> 00:48:07,400
WHITNEY AND WESTON AND THE BIRTH

1923
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:09,833
OF THEIR BABY BOY.

1924
00:48:09,833 --> 00:48:11,800
[applause]

1925
00:48:15,067 --> 00:48:15,667
>> SORRY.

1926
00:48:15,667 --> 00:48:16,400
>> IT'S OKAY.

1927
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,067
>> THIS REALLY MADE ME GROW UP

1928
00:48:18,067 --> 00:48:19,833
SO MUCH, AND IT WAS KIND OF

1929
00:48:19,833 --> 00:48:20,667
SCARY.

1930
00:48:20,667 --> 00:48:21,367
>> SHOULD WE BRING OUT THE

1931
00:48:21,367 --> 00:48:22,067
BABIES?

1932
00:48:22,067 --> 00:48:22,800
>> together: YES.

1933
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:23,467
>> LET'S DO IT.

1934
00:48:23,467 --> 00:48:25,433
BABIES?

1935
00:48:37,533 --> 00:48:38,567
>> WELCOME BACK.

1936
00:48:38,567 --> 00:48:39,533
LET'S REVISIT ANOTHER

1937
00:48:39,533 --> 00:48:41,067
UNFORGETTABLE STORY FROM THIS

1938
00:48:41,067 --> 00:48:41,800
SEASON.

1939
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,867
OF COURSE, I'M TALKING ABOUT

1940
00:48:42,867 --> 00:48:44,633
WHITNEY AND WESTON AND THE BIRTH

1941
00:48:44,633 --> 00:48:48,533
OF THEIR BABY BOY.

1942
00:48:48,533 --> 00:48:49,833
>> I JUST FEEL LIKE

1943
00:48:49,833 --> 00:48:51,467
EVERYBODY IS STARING AT ME,

1944
00:48:51,467 --> 00:48:53,133
BECAUSE I HAVE A BEACH BALL

1945
00:48:53,133 --> 00:48:54,333
UNDER MY SHIRT.

1946
00:48:54,333 --> 00:48:55,300
>> WHITNEY CAN'T BEND DOWN

1947
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:56,700
AND TIE HER SHOE HERSELF?

1948
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:57,767
>> SHE'S USED TO BEING WAITED ON

1949
00:48:57,767 --> 00:48:58,700
HAND AND FOOT.

1950
00:48:58,700 --> 00:48:59,667
>> [groaning]

1951
00:48:59,667 --> 00:49:00,667
THIS BABY'S READY TO BE BORN,

1952
00:49:00,667 --> 00:49:03,500
I THINK, SO...

1953
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,667
YOU'VE GOT TO BURP HIM, CHANGE A

1954
00:49:04,667 --> 00:49:06,067
DIAPER, AND COOK,

1955
00:49:06,067 --> 00:49:07,100
AND MAKE SURE THE HOUSE

1956
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:08,567
IS CLEAN AND THE LAUNDRY'S DONE.

1957
00:49:08,567 --> 00:49:09,233
THIS IS WHAT GROWING UP

1958
00:49:09,233 --> 00:49:11,067
IS ALL ABOUT.

1959
00:49:11,067 --> 00:49:11,933
>> I'M TIRED OF Y'ALL

1960
00:49:11,933 --> 00:49:13,100
NOT DAMN DOING ANYTHING.

1961
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,400
>> WE DON'T DO ANYTHING?

1962
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:15,733
WE CAN'T [bleep] STAND IT

1963
00:49:15,733 --> 00:49:16,567
HERE ANYMORE.

1964
00:49:16,567 --> 00:49:17,833
>> Y'ALL NEED TO MOVE.

1965
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:19,133
>> TO BE HONEST, I JUST DON'T

1966
00:49:19,133 --> 00:49:20,500
THINK WE CAN AFFORD IT.

1967
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:22,467
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

1968
00:49:27,667 --> 00:49:28,800
>> WHITNEY AND WESTON, WELCOME

1969
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,467
TO THE SHOW.

1970
00:49:29,467 --> 00:49:30,167
>> THANKS.

1971
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:32,367
>> SOMEBODY MADE A COMMENT THAT

1972
00:49:32,367 --> 00:49:33,733
YOU WERE A BABY HAVING A BABY,

1973
00:49:33,733 --> 00:49:35,233
THAT YOU COULDN'T EVEN TIE YOUR

1974
00:49:35,233 --> 00:49:35,967
OWN SHOES.

1975
00:49:35,967 --> 00:49:39,333
>> I CAN TIE MY OWN SHOES.

1976
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:40,633
>> DID YOU GROW UP?

1977
00:49:40,633 --> 00:49:42,633
>> I GREW UP A LOT.

1978
00:49:42,633 --> 00:49:43,467
>> HOW?

1979
00:49:43,467 --> 00:49:46,067
>> JUST--I USED TO JUST BE

1980
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:47,667
SILLY ALL THE TIME.

1981
00:49:47,667 --> 00:49:49,933
JUST MAKING JOKES AND ALWAYS

1982
00:49:49,933 --> 00:49:53,833
JUMPING AROUND, AND I NEVER

1983
00:49:53,833 --> 00:49:55,600
CARED ABOUT ANYBODY ELSE BUT

1984
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:58,567
MYSELF, AND THEN THIS HAS BEEN

1985
00:49:58,567 --> 00:50:00,700
A--REALLY A WAKE-UP CALL.

1986
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,833
>> ONE OF THE MOST IMMATURE

1987
00:50:02,833 --> 00:50:05,167
KINDS OF THINKING PEOPLE CAN

1988
00:50:05,167 --> 00:50:06,200
HAVE IS SORT OF MAGICAL

1989
00:50:06,200 --> 00:50:07,067
THINKING, LIKE, "THIS ISN'T

1990
00:50:07,067 --> 00:50:07,767
GONNA HAPPEN TO ME.

1991
00:50:07,767 --> 00:50:09,200
I'M INVINCIBLE.

1992
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,867
I'M NOT GONNA GET PREGNANT."

1993
00:50:10,867 --> 00:50:12,933
WERE YOU THINKING LIKE THAT?

1994
00:50:12,933 --> 00:50:15,200
>> YEAH, I DEFINITELY WAS.

1995
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:15,933
I MEAN--

1996
00:50:15,933 --> 00:50:16,700
>> WERE YOU READY TO HAVE SEX

1997
00:50:16,700 --> 00:50:18,800
EVEN?

1998
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,067
>> UM...

1999
00:50:21,067 --> 00:50:22,767
I THINK I WAS, BUT I DON'T--

2000
00:50:22,767 --> 00:50:23,500
>> REALLY.

2001
00:50:23,500 --> 00:50:24,167
>> I DON'T KNOW.

2002
00:50:24,167 --> 00:50:24,867
>> YOU DON'T KNOW.

2003
00:50:24,867 --> 00:50:25,733
I THINK THAT'S MAYBE THE MORE

2004
00:50:25,733 --> 00:50:27,267
HONEST ANSWER, BECAUSE

2005
00:50:27,267 --> 00:50:28,200
SOMEBODY WHO'S READY TO HAVE SEX

2006
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,400
WOULD PLAN CONTRACEPTION,

2007
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:30,133
WOULDN'T THEY?

2008
00:50:30,133 --> 00:50:32,933
>> MM-HMM.

2009
00:50:32,933 --> 00:50:34,567
>> I'M NOT--I'M NOT INTENDING TO

2010
00:50:34,567 --> 00:50:35,967
MAKE YOU FEEL GUILTY, BUT IT IS

2011
00:50:35,967 --> 00:50:38,300
WHAT'S HAPPENED HERE.

2012
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,833
A BABY'S HAD A BABY.

2013
00:50:40,833 --> 00:50:43,200
YOU ALL RIGHT WITH THAT?

2014
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:47,633
>> [laughs]

2015
00:50:47,633 --> 00:50:49,200
I MEAN, I GUESS I WAS LIKE THAT

2016
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:53,300
BEFORE, BUT...

2017
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:54,533
[exhales]

2018
00:50:54,533 --> 00:50:55,667
I'M SORRY.

2019
00:50:55,667 --> 00:50:56,500
>> IT'S OKAY.

2020
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,067
>> BUT IT'S REALLY MADE ME GROW

2021
00:50:58,067 --> 00:51:00,367
UP SO MUCH, AND IT'S KIND OF

2022
00:51:00,367 --> 00:51:02,367
SCARY TO THINK HOW EVERYTHING

2023
00:51:02,367 --> 00:51:05,967
USED TO BE, AND NOW, IT'S, LIKE,

2024
00:51:05,967 --> 00:51:08,267
THE BIGGEST CHANGE, AND IT

2025
00:51:08,267 --> 00:51:12,500
JUST ALL HAPPENED SO FAST,

2026
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:16,433
AND, I MEAN, I'M HAPPY ABOUT IT,

2027
00:51:16,433 --> 00:51:18,900
AND I GUESS IT'S WHAT I NEEDED.

2028
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:22,167
>> TO GROW UP?

2029
00:51:22,167 --> 00:51:23,167
MY UNDERSTANDING IS BABY WESTON

2030
00:51:23,167 --> 00:51:24,733
HAS SOME MEDICAL ISSUES.

2031
00:51:24,733 --> 00:51:26,267
>> MM-HMM.

2032
00:51:26,267 --> 00:51:27,167
>> HOW'D YOU FIGURE THAT OUT?

2033
00:51:27,167 --> 00:51:28,167
HOW'D YOU COME TO UNDERSTAND

2034
00:51:28,167 --> 00:51:29,567
THAT?

2035
00:51:29,567 --> 00:51:32,067
>> UM...

2036
00:51:32,067 --> 00:51:34,333
HE JUST--WHEN HE WOULD EAT, HE

2037
00:51:34,333 --> 00:51:35,367
WOULD ALWAYS THROW UP, SO HE

2038
00:51:35,367 --> 00:51:37,067
WASN'T GAINING THAT MUCH WEIGHT,

2039
00:51:37,067 --> 00:51:37,833
BUT THEY COULDN'T FIGURE OUT

2040
00:51:37,833 --> 00:51:39,233
WHAT IT WAS.

2041
00:51:39,233 --> 00:51:39,933
>> DID HE HAVE TO BE

2042
00:51:39,933 --> 00:51:40,600
HOSPITALIZED?

2043
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:41,900
>> YEAH, FOR ABOUT A WEEK AND A

2044
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,433
HALF, AND THEN HIS--THEN THEY

2045
00:51:44,433 --> 00:51:45,500
NOTICED THAT HIS LIVER WAS

2046
00:51:45,500 --> 00:51:46,267
SWELLING UP.

2047
00:51:46,267 --> 00:51:47,900
>> ENLARGED, SO MY

2048
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:48,933
UNDERSTANDING IS, HE HAS

2049
00:51:48,933 --> 00:51:49,667
SOMETHING CALLED

2050
00:51:49,667 --> 00:51:51,200
ALPHA-1 ANTITRYPSIN DEFICIENCY,

2051
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:53,467
WHICH IS A GENETIC DISORDER.

2052
00:51:53,467 --> 00:51:54,933
WHAT'S IT GONNA MEAN FOR HIM?

2053
00:51:54,933 --> 00:51:56,367
>> WELL, HE CAN'T PLAY SPORTS

2054
00:51:56,367 --> 00:51:57,433
WHEN HE GETS OLDER OR ANYTHING

2055
00:51:57,433 --> 00:51:58,767
LIKE THAT, AND--

2056
00:51:58,767 --> 00:52:00,133
>> HE CAN'T SMOKE CIGARETTES

2057
00:52:00,133 --> 00:52:00,800
WHEN HE GETS OLDER.

2058
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,500
>> YEAH, MM-HMM.

2059
00:52:02,500 --> 00:52:03,600
>> ONE OF THE ASPECTS OF

2060
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:04,467
ALPHA-1 ANTITRYPSIN IS,

2061
00:52:04,467 --> 00:52:05,833
THEY GET EMPHYSEMA, IF THEY

2062
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:06,967
SMOKE, REALLY BAD.

2063
00:52:06,967 --> 00:52:07,633
>> MM-HMM.

2064
00:52:07,633 --> 00:52:08,433
>> MM?

2065
00:52:08,433 --> 00:52:09,133
>> MM-HMM.

2066
00:52:09,133 --> 00:52:09,967
>> OKAY, NO SMOKING.

2067
00:52:09,967 --> 00:52:10,800
DO YOU GUYS SMOKE?

2068
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:11,467
>> I DO.

2069
00:52:11,467 --> 00:52:12,167
>> YOU'VE GOT TO STOP.

2070
00:52:12,167 --> 00:52:12,933
>> YES, SIR.

2071
00:52:12,933 --> 00:52:14,567
>> BECAUSE BABIES WHOSE PARENTS

2072
00:52:14,567 --> 00:52:16,833
SMOKE BECOME ADULTS THAT SMOKE.

2073
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:17,967
>> MM-HMM.

2074
00:52:17,967 --> 00:52:19,067
>> OKAY?

2075
00:52:19,067 --> 00:52:20,400
IS HE THRIVING, THOUGH,

2076
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:21,400
OTHERWISE NOW, DOING OKAY?

2077
00:52:21,400 --> 00:52:22,100
>> MM-HMM.

2078
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:22,900
>> BUT BOY, WHAT A SCARY THING

2079
00:52:22,900 --> 00:52:23,633
TO GO THROUGH.

2080
00:52:23,633 --> 00:52:24,967
>> IT IS.

2081
00:52:24,967 --> 00:52:26,833
LIKE, BEFORE, YOU REALLY DON'T

2082
00:52:26,833 --> 00:52:27,767
THINK THAT NOTHING'S GONNA BE

2083
00:52:27,767 --> 00:52:30,467
WRONG, AND THEN YOU ALWAYS

2084
00:52:30,467 --> 00:52:31,967
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT HIM NOW

2085
00:52:31,967 --> 00:52:33,467
KNOWING THAT HE HAS SOMETHING

2086
00:52:33,467 --> 00:52:36,067
WRONG WITH HIM, AND I'M SCARED

2087
00:52:36,067 --> 00:52:37,467
THAT IF--WHEN HE GETS OLDER,

2088
00:52:37,467 --> 00:52:39,200
AND HE WANTS TO JUST BE LIKE

2089
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,633
EVERYONE ELSE AND PARTY, YOU

2090
00:52:40,633 --> 00:52:41,800
KNOW, WITH HIS FRIENDS, AND HE

2091
00:52:41,800 --> 00:52:42,900
CAN'T DRINK OR ANYTHING LIKE

2092
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:43,900
THAT.

2093
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:45,733
>> I WILL TELL YOU, IF--AGAIN,

2094
00:52:45,733 --> 00:52:46,867
IF YOU ARE THE KIND OF PARENT

2095
00:52:46,867 --> 00:52:48,167
THAT DOESN'T DRINK AND DOESN'T

2096
00:52:48,167 --> 00:52:49,433
SMOKE, IT'S MUCH LESS LIKELY

2097
00:52:49,433 --> 00:52:50,400
THAT HE WILL.

2098
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:51,500
>> I MEAN, I DON'T.

2099
00:52:51,500 --> 00:52:52,767
>> AS YOU FOUND OUT MAYBE FROM

2100
00:52:52,767 --> 00:52:53,700
SOME OF THESE STORIES AND SOME

2101
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:55,267
OF YOUR PEERS, IT REALLY DOESN'T

2102
00:52:55,267 --> 00:52:56,133
MATTER SO MUCH WHAT THE PARENTS

2103
00:52:56,133 --> 00:52:56,867
SAY.

2104
00:52:56,867 --> 00:52:58,100
IT'S MORE ABOUT HOW THEY LIVE

2105
00:52:58,100 --> 00:52:58,833
THEIR LIVES.

2106
00:52:58,833 --> 00:52:59,667
>> MM-HMM.

2107
00:52:59,667 --> 00:53:00,567
>> MM?

2108
00:53:00,567 --> 00:53:01,533
>> MM-HMM.

2109
00:53:01,533 --> 00:53:02,467
>> WESTON, YOU'RE DOING SUCH A

2110
00:53:02,467 --> 00:53:03,567
GREAT JOB AS A DAD.

2111
00:53:03,567 --> 00:53:07,067
WHERE DO YOU GO FOR SUPPORT?

2112
00:53:07,067 --> 00:53:08,700
>> UM...

2113
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:11,067
MY MOM HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE

2114
00:53:11,067 --> 00:53:12,933
FOR ME, AND SHE'S ABOUT THE ONLY

2115
00:53:12,933 --> 00:53:14,800
PERSON, OTHER THAN WHITNEY, OF

2116
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:16,400
COURSE, THAT I COULD GO TO WITH

2117
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,700
ANYTHING.

2118
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:19,900
IT WOULDN'T MATTER WHAT IT WAS.

2119
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:20,633
>> SO YOUR MOM.

2120
00:53:20,633 --> 00:53:21,433
DO YOU HAVE ANY PEERS, ANY

2121
00:53:21,433 --> 00:53:24,100
OTHER--ANY OTHER FRIENDS?

2122
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:25,133
>> NOT REALLY.

2123
00:53:25,133 --> 00:53:26,367
I DON'T REALLY HANG OUT WITH

2124
00:53:26,367 --> 00:53:28,567
ANYBODY OR TALK TO ANYBODY.

2125
00:53:28,567 --> 00:53:30,867
>> WESTON, IF YOU WERE TALKING

2126
00:53:30,867 --> 00:53:33,067
TO A GROUP OF 15-YEAR-OLDS OUT

2127
00:53:33,067 --> 00:53:34,633
HERE WHO WERE THINKING ABOUT

2128
00:53:34,633 --> 00:53:35,667
HAVING SEX, THOUGHT IT WAS A

2129
00:53:35,667 --> 00:53:36,767
COOL THING, WHAT WOULD YOU TELL

2130
00:53:36,767 --> 00:53:37,767
THEM?

2131
00:53:37,767 --> 00:53:39,600
>> THINK AGAIN.

2132
00:53:39,600 --> 00:53:40,900
TAKE EXTRA PRECAUTIONS AFTER THE

2133
00:53:40,900 --> 00:53:42,900
PRECAUTIONS.

2134
00:53:42,900 --> 00:53:43,567
I MEAN...

2135
00:53:43,567 --> 00:53:44,467
>> PRECAUTIONS ON PRECAUTIONS.

2136
00:53:44,467 --> 00:53:45,133
>> YES.

2137
00:53:45,133 --> 00:53:45,933
>> DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAD TO

2138
00:53:45,933 --> 00:53:49,167
GIVE UP YOUR DREAMS?

2139
00:53:49,167 --> 00:53:51,967
>> IN--IN SOME WAY, I FEEL LIKE

2140
00:53:51,967 --> 00:53:53,833
I'M GONNA BE MORE SUCCESSFUL

2141
00:53:53,833 --> 00:53:55,433
NOW, BECAUSE IT'S KIND OF MADE

2142
00:53:55,433 --> 00:53:57,467
ME TAKE THAT PUSH THAT--BECAUSE

2143
00:53:57,467 --> 00:53:58,567
I KNOW I HAVE TO DO THIS

2144
00:53:58,567 --> 00:54:01,067
TO SUPPORT HIM AND TO DO

2145
00:54:01,067 --> 00:54:02,333
EVERYTHING, AND I THINK IF I

2146
00:54:02,333 --> 00:54:03,567
WOULDN'T HAVE, I WOULD HAVE JUST

2147
00:54:03,567 --> 00:54:04,867
BEEN LIKE, "OH, I CAN DO THIS

2148
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:06,067
LATER, AND I CAN HAVE FUN

2149
00:54:06,067 --> 00:54:08,433
RIGHT NOW."

2150
00:54:08,433 --> 00:54:09,833
>> SO EVEN THOUGH IT'S HARD,

2151
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:11,400
THERE'S BEEN SOME--SOME REAL

2152
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:13,200
GOOD THINGS HAVE COME OUT OF IT.

2153
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:13,933
>> MM-HMM.

2154
00:54:13,933 --> 00:54:14,967
>> OKAY, WELL, THANK YOU, GUYS.

2155
00:54:14,967 --> 00:54:16,533
THANK YOU.

2156
00:54:16,533 --> 00:54:17,567
WE'RE GONNA STEP ASIDE FOR ONE

2157
00:54:17,567 --> 00:54:19,200
LAST BREAK, AND WHEN WE RETURN,

2158
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,233
WE'RE COMING BACK WITH WHAT

2159
00:54:20,233 --> 00:54:21,067
WE'RE CALLING THE SPOTLIGHT 

2160
00:54:21,067 --> 00:54:22,800
SESSION, WHEN THE TEEN MOMS COME

2161
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,067
TOGETHER ON THIS STAGE AND ASK

2162
00:54:24,067 --> 00:54:25,200
THE QUESTIONS THEY WANT

2163
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:26,267
ANSWERED.

2164
00:54:26,267 --> 00:54:27,233
PLUS, WE'RE GONNA MEET THE REAL

2165
00:54:27,233 --> 00:54:29,367
STARS OF THIS SHOW: THE BABIES.

2166
00:54:29,367 --> 00:54:30,067
DON'T MOVE.

2167
00:54:30,067 --> 00:54:30,800
WE'RE COMING RIGHT BACK.

2168
00:54:30,800 --> 00:54:32,767
[applause]

2169
00:54:49,167 --> 00:54:51,167
[applause]

2170
00:54:51,167 --> 00:54:51,833
>> WE'RE BACK.

2171
00:54:51,833 --> 00:54:53,600
I'M DR. DREW, AND THIS IS LIFE 

2172
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:55,300
 AFTER LABOR: THE 16 AND 

2173
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:57,333
 PREGNANT FINALE SPECIAL. 

2174
00:54:57,333 --> 00:54:58,700
AND WE'RE JOINED NOW BY THE

2175
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:01,167
ENTIRE CAST, ALL SIX MOMS,

2176
00:55:01,167 --> 00:55:02,700
AND I KNOW THESE YOUNG WOMEN

2177
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:04,300
HAVE QUESTIONS FOR ONE ANOTHER,

2178
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,500
SO LET'S GET RIGHT TO THAT.

2179
00:55:06,500 --> 00:55:07,567
>> I HAVE A QUESTION FOR ALL THE

2180
00:55:07,567 --> 00:55:08,767
GIRLS.

2181
00:55:08,767 --> 00:55:10,600
SO I KNOW WE'VE TOUCHED ON

2182
00:55:10,600 --> 00:55:13,100
THAT--PROTECTION,

2183
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:15,867
AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW JUST HOW

2184
00:55:15,867 --> 00:55:18,067
MANY OF US DIDN'T USE CONDOMS

2185
00:55:18,067 --> 00:55:18,867
WHEN WE GOT PREGNANT.

2186
00:55:18,867 --> 00:55:19,700
>> SHOW OF HANDS.

2187
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:20,433
HOW MANY PEOPLE DID NOT USE

2188
00:55:20,433 --> 00:55:21,100
PROTECTION?

2189
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:22,267
>> I DID SOMETIMES, SOMETIMES

2190
00:55:22,267 --> 00:55:23,467
NOT, SO...

2191
00:55:23,467 --> 00:55:24,333
>> IT'S LIKE WEARING YOUR SEAT

2192
00:55:24,333 --> 00:55:25,067
BELT.

2193
00:55:25,067 --> 00:55:25,767
YOU'VE GOT TO WEAR IT ALL THE

2194
00:55:25,767 --> 00:55:26,467
TIME....

2195
00:55:26,467 --> 00:55:27,167
>> YEAH.

2196
00:55:27,167 --> 00:55:27,833
>> ALL THE TIME.

2197
00:55:27,833 --> 00:55:29,133
SO NOBODY PRACTICED ANY

2198
00:55:29,133 --> 00:55:30,767
CONTRACEPTIVE.

2199
00:55:30,767 --> 00:55:31,467
>> NOPE.

2200
00:55:31,467 --> 00:55:32,167
>> I DID, BUT IT STOPPED.

2201
00:55:32,167 --> 00:55:33,600
>> YEAH, IT STOPPED AFTER A

2202
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,633
WHILE, SO...

2203
00:55:34,633 --> 00:55:35,533
>> YEAH.

2204
00:55:35,533 --> 00:55:36,333
>> WHO'S PRACTICING

2205
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:37,933
CONTRACEPTION NOW?

2206
00:55:37,933 --> 00:55:39,167
EVERYBODY--OH...

2207
00:55:39,167 --> 00:55:39,967
>> I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT

2208
00:55:39,967 --> 00:55:40,633
IT.

2209
00:55:40,633 --> 00:55:41,500
>> YOU DON'T HAVE A BOYFRIEND.

2210
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:43,500
[laughter]

2211
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,833
>> UM, I HAVE A QUESTION FOR

2212
00:55:44,833 --> 00:55:45,600
YOU.

2213
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,700
I DON'T KNOW HIM, SO I'M NOT

2214
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,067
GONNA SAY ANYTHING, BUT JUST

2215
00:55:49,067 --> 00:55:49,933
FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN ON THE SHOW,

2216
00:55:49,933 --> 00:55:50,667
IT JUST HURT MY FEELINGS.

2217
00:55:50,667 --> 00:55:51,433
JUST THE WAY THAT HE TREATED

2218
00:55:51,433 --> 00:55:52,267
YOU AND THE THINGS THAT HE SAID

2219
00:55:52,267 --> 00:55:52,933
TO YOU.

2220
00:55:52,933 --> 00:55:53,600
>> YEAH.

2221
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,367
>> I JUST WANT TO KNOW, HAS HE

2222
00:55:54,367 --> 00:55:55,233
ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THAT, OR WAS IT

2223
00:55:55,233 --> 00:55:55,900
JUST--

2224
00:55:55,900 --> 00:55:56,633
>> NO.

2225
00:55:56,633 --> 00:55:57,300
>> NO.

2226
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:58,600
>> WHEN WE FIRST STARTING

2227
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:02,633
DATING, I--I NEVER REALLY

2228
00:56:02,633 --> 00:56:04,067
HAD A BOYFRIEND BEFORE,

2229
00:56:04,067 --> 00:56:05,067
AND HE WAS MY FIRST BOYFRIEND,

2230
00:56:05,067 --> 00:56:06,633
AND I DIDN'T GIVE MY ALL TO HIM,

2231
00:56:06,633 --> 00:56:08,067
BUT HE DEFINITELY GAVE HIS ALL

2232
00:56:08,067 --> 00:56:08,900
TO ME.

2233
00:56:08,900 --> 00:56:11,267
IT WENT GOOD AND THEN BAD AND

2234
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:12,167
BACK TO GOOD.

2235
00:56:12,167 --> 00:56:13,133
>> WHAT ARE YOU THINKING,

2236
00:56:13,133 --> 00:56:13,800
CATELYNN?

2237
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,700
>> WHAT AM I THINKING?

2238
00:56:15,700 --> 00:56:17,533
NOTHING, 'CAUSE IT JUST--I JUST

2239
00:56:17,533 --> 00:56:18,567
KIND OF FELT BAD FOR HER,

2240
00:56:18,567 --> 00:56:20,333
BECAUSE IF--I MEAN--

2241
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:21,167
>> ONE THING YOU'VE GOT TO HAND

2242
00:56:21,167 --> 00:56:21,900
TO HIM: HE WAS HONEST.

2243
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,300
>> YEAH, I MEAN, THAT'S A GOOD

2244
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:24,500
THING THAT IT'S HONEST, BUT JUST

2245
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:25,833
WHEN I WATCHED, AND I HEARD HIM

2246
00:56:25,833 --> 00:56:26,933
SAY THAT, LIKE, THAT, LIKE,

2247
00:56:26,933 --> 00:56:28,533
CRUSHED MY HEART.

2248
00:56:28,533 --> 00:56:29,900
LIKE, I WAS, LIKE, AND THEN YOU

2249
00:56:29,900 --> 00:56:31,067
JUST, LIKE, SAT THERE, AND YOU

2250
00:56:31,067 --> 00:56:31,967
WERE JUST LIKE, "OH, WELL, THEN

2251
00:56:31,967 --> 00:56:32,800
YOU NEED TO LEAVE," AND I WAS

2252
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:34,600
JUST, LIKE, I FELT SO BAD FOR

2253
00:56:34,600 --> 00:56:36,433
YOU, BECAUSE IF TYLER WERE TO

2254
00:56:36,433 --> 00:56:37,467
SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT TO ME, I

2255
00:56:37,467 --> 00:56:38,700
MEAN, I WOULD JUST--

2256
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:39,833
>> IT'S REALISTIC.

2257
00:56:39,833 --> 00:56:40,500
HE WAS REALISTIC.

2258
00:56:40,500 --> 00:56:41,167
HE WAS HONEST.

2259
00:56:41,167 --> 00:56:41,967
>> RIGHT, THAT'S JUST HOW IT

2260
00:56:41,967 --> 00:56:43,067
WAS.

2261
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:43,967
>> DO YOU GUYS FEEL SUPPORTIVE

2262
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:44,867
OF ONE ANOTHER?

2263
00:56:44,867 --> 00:56:45,600
>> COMPLETELY.

2264
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:46,600
>> YOU LOOK AT EACH OTHER, AND

2265
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:47,800
YOU--

2266
00:56:47,800 --> 00:56:48,733
>> I FEEL LIKE THE FIRST TIME I

2267
00:56:48,733 --> 00:56:50,067
SAW EVERY ONE OF THEM, I WAS

2268
00:56:50,067 --> 00:56:50,900
LIKE, "THEY'RE, LIKE, MY BEST

2269
00:56:50,900 --> 00:56:51,667
FRIENDS."

2270
00:56:51,667 --> 00:56:52,333
>> ALREADY.

2271
00:56:52,333 --> 00:56:53,067
>> SHE JUST CAME UP TO ME AND

2272
00:56:53,067 --> 00:56:53,767
HUGGED ME, MACI.

2273
00:56:53,767 --> 00:56:54,700
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HER, AND SHE

2274
00:56:54,700 --> 00:56:55,500
WAS JUST, LIKE, HUGS ME,

2275
00:56:55,500 --> 00:56:56,200
AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, HI."

2276
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,867
[laughter]

2277
00:56:57,867 --> 00:56:59,133
>> WHEN I WATCHED YOUR SHOW, I

2278
00:56:59,133 --> 00:57:01,533
JUST THOUGHT YOU WERE SO STRONG,

2279
00:57:01,533 --> 00:57:02,733
AND NOW THAT I'VE MET YOU AND

2280
00:57:02,733 --> 00:57:04,233
BEEN AROUND YOU, I THINK THAT

2281
00:57:04,233 --> 00:57:06,100
WHEN YOU GET OLDER AND YOU DO

2282
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:07,300
HAVE A BABY, YOU'RE GONNA BE AN

2283
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,933
AWESOME MOM.

2284
00:57:08,933 --> 00:57:10,067
>> YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME CRY.

2285
00:57:10,067 --> 00:57:11,900
>> YOU'RE JUST LIKE US.

2286
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:13,333
YOU COULD DO IT.

2287
00:57:13,333 --> 00:57:14,067
>> THANKS.

2288
00:57:14,067 --> 00:57:17,867
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

2289
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,267
>> WE HAVE AN AUDIENCE QUESTION

2290
00:57:19,267 --> 00:57:21,233
FROM BECKY.

2291
00:57:21,233 --> 00:57:22,100
>> HI, GUYS.

2292
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:23,200
FROM WATCHING THE SHOW, I

2293
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,533
NOTICED THAT MOST OF YOU CHOSE

2294
00:57:24,533 --> 00:57:25,867
NOT TO BREAST-FEED YOUR BABIES,

2295
00:57:25,867 --> 00:57:27,167
AND I WAS JUST WONDERING HOW YOU

2296
00:57:27,167 --> 00:57:30,233
CAME TO THAT DECISION.

2297
00:57:30,233 --> 00:57:31,600
>> WHO WANTS TO ANSWER THAT?

2298
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,067
PEOPLE HAVE GRAVE MISCONCEPTIONS

2299
00:57:33,067 --> 00:57:33,933
ABOUT BREAST-FEEDING.

2300
00:57:33,933 --> 00:57:35,100
>> CAN I ANSWER THAT?

2301
00:57:35,100 --> 00:57:35,833
>> PLEASE.

2302
00:57:35,833 --> 00:57:38,300
>> I BREAST-FED FOR A TOTAL OF

2303
00:57:38,300 --> 00:57:41,500
TWO WEEKS, AND WHAT GETS PEOPLE

2304
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:45,733
ABOUT BREAST-FEEDING, YOUR--

2305
00:57:45,733 --> 00:57:46,467
OH, MY GOODNESS.

2306
00:57:46,467 --> 00:57:47,700
>> IT HURTS.

2307
00:57:47,700 --> 00:57:48,967
>> IT HURTS.

2308
00:57:48,967 --> 00:57:51,267
YOUR BOOBS ARE SO ENGORGED WITH

2309
00:57:51,267 --> 00:57:52,567
MILK.

2310
00:57:52,567 --> 00:57:53,967
LIKE, YOU HAVE TO CONSTANTLY

2311
00:57:53,967 --> 00:57:56,900
PUMP, AND YOU DRIP, AND...

2312
00:57:56,900 --> 00:57:57,833
>> THERE'S JUST BODY LEAKING

2313
00:57:57,833 --> 00:57:58,767
EVERYWHERE.

2314
00:57:58,767 --> 00:58:00,733
>> LEAKING FLUIDS, LIKE I SAID.

2315
00:58:00,733 --> 00:58:02,667
>> YEAH, I MADE THE DECISION

2316
00:58:02,667 --> 00:58:04,633
TO BREAST-FEED, AND I WAS GOING

2317
00:58:04,633 --> 00:58:06,067
TO UP TO THE DAY WHEN I HAD

2318
00:58:06,067 --> 00:58:07,833
LEAH, AND ALL MY FAMILY WOULD

2319
00:58:07,833 --> 00:58:08,933
COME IN, AND THEY ALL WERE LIKE,

2320
00:58:08,933 --> 00:58:10,733
"OH, IT HURTS SO BAD," AND THEY

2321
00:58:10,733 --> 00:58:11,933
JUST SCARED ME OUT OF IT, BUT I

2322
00:58:11,933 --> 00:58:14,133
WAS GOING TO DO IT, AND BY THE

2323
00:58:14,133 --> 00:58:15,167
TIME I ACTUALLY MADE THE

2324
00:58:15,167 --> 00:58:16,367
DECISION TO, I WASN'T DEVELOPING

2325
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:17,933
ENOUGH MILK TO, SO...

2326
00:58:17,933 --> 00:58:18,800
>> SO YOU HAVE TO PRODUCE ENOUGH

2327
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:19,500
MILK.

2328
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,333
YOU HAVE TO BE ABLE TO TOLERATE

2329
00:58:20,333 --> 00:58:21,500
THE PAIN, AND THEN THE BABY HAS

2330
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:22,233
TO COOPERATE.

2331
00:58:22,233 --> 00:58:23,067
>> together: RIGHT.

2332
00:58:23,067 --> 00:58:23,667
>> DID ANYBODY HAVE A

2333
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:24,567
COOPERATIVE BABY?

2334
00:58:24,567 --> 00:58:25,467
ANYBODY?

2335
00:58:25,467 --> 00:58:26,700
>> SOPHIA COOPERATED, BUT I

2336
00:58:26,700 --> 00:58:27,933
QUIT.

2337
00:58:27,933 --> 00:58:30,267
>> AFTER HOW LONG?

2338
00:58:30,267 --> 00:58:31,767
>> A LITTLE LESS THAN A WEEK,

2339
00:58:31,767 --> 00:58:32,500
AND SO...

2340
00:58:32,500 --> 00:58:33,800
>> BECAUSE...

2341
00:58:33,800 --> 00:58:35,400
>> IT WAS JUST TOO MUCH.

2342
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:36,067
I DON'T KNOW.

2343
00:58:36,067 --> 00:58:37,533
I JUST FOUND IT TIRING.

2344
00:58:37,533 --> 00:58:38,200
>> IT IS.

2345
00:58:38,200 --> 00:58:39,767
>> SO...

2346
00:58:39,767 --> 00:58:40,867
>> IT'S PRETTY COMPLICATED,

2347
00:58:40,867 --> 00:58:41,567
BREAST-FEEDING.

2348
00:58:41,567 --> 00:58:42,267
IT'S MUCH MORE THAN THE

2349
00:58:42,267 --> 00:58:44,067
SORT OF THE "ROMANTIC NOTION"

2350
00:58:44,067 --> 00:58:45,667
THAT PEOPLE HAVE ABOUT IT.

2351
00:58:45,667 --> 00:58:46,833
>> THEY GET SO HARD.

2352
00:58:46,833 --> 00:58:49,100
>> THEY GET HARD, AND THEY HURT.

2353
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:50,833
>> IT'S HARD TO EXPLAIN, BUT,

2354
00:58:50,833 --> 00:58:51,767
LIKE, THE ONLY THING THAT

2355
00:58:51,767 --> 00:58:53,400
RELIEVED ME WAS IN THE SHOWER.

2356
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:54,100
>> together: YEAH.

2357
00:58:54,100 --> 00:58:56,067
>> THE SHOWER, OH, YES.

2358
00:58:56,067 --> 00:58:59,067
>> IT WAS--IT FELT LIKE BRICKS.

2359
00:58:59,067 --> 00:59:00,533
[laughter]

2360
00:59:00,533 --> 00:59:01,867
>> SIMONE IS OUT IN THE AUDIENCE

2361
00:59:01,867 --> 00:59:03,433
STANDING BY WITH A QUESTION.

2362
00:59:03,433 --> 00:59:05,167
>> MY QUESTION IS, NOW THAT YOU

2363
00:59:05,167 --> 00:59:06,633
GUYS HAVE HAD CHILDREN,

2364
00:59:06,633 --> 00:59:07,933
WHAT MESSAGES WOULD YOU POSSIBLY

2365
00:59:07,933 --> 00:59:09,867
LIKE TO TEACH THEM IN THE FUTURE

2366
00:59:09,867 --> 00:59:11,700
ABOUT TEENAGE PREGNANCY,

2367
00:59:11,700 --> 00:59:12,733
CONTRACEPTION, AND

2368
00:59:12,733 --> 00:59:14,100
RELATIONSHIPS?

2369
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,233
>> BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN A TEEN

2370
00:59:15,233 --> 00:59:17,267
PARENT, IT'S MORE LIKELY THAT

2371
00:59:17,267 --> 00:59:18,367
YOUR CHILDREN COULD BE AT RISK

2372
00:59:18,367 --> 00:59:20,400
FOR TEEN PARENTING.

2373
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,400
>> THAT'S A STATISTIC?

2374
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:23,400
>> MM-HMM, AND SO WHAT ARE YOU

2375
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,067
GONNA TELL YOUR KIDS?

2376
00:59:24,067 --> 00:59:24,967
HOW ARE YOU GONNA LIVE YOUR

2377
00:59:24,967 --> 00:59:25,633
LIFE?

2378
00:59:25,633 --> 00:59:26,633
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO TO TRY TO

2379
00:59:26,633 --> 00:59:28,300
ENCOURAGE THEM MAYBE NOT TO DO

2380
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:29,067
THE SAME THING?

2381
00:59:29,067 --> 00:59:29,833
>> YOU'VE JUST GOT TO TALK TO

2382
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:30,500
THEM.

2383
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,667
MY PARENTS DIDN'T TALK TO ME

2384
00:59:31,667 --> 00:59:33,067
ABOUT ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

2385
00:59:33,067 --> 00:59:34,433
>> I MEAN, IF I HAD A DAUGHTER

2386
00:59:34,433 --> 00:59:35,567
OR EVEN IF I HAD A SON, I'D BE

2387
00:59:35,567 --> 00:59:36,533
BUYING HIM CONDOMS, EVEN IF I

2388
00:59:36,533 --> 00:59:37,400
DIDN'T THINK HE WAS HAVING SEX.

2389
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:38,933
JUST SO HE KNOWS THAT, "YOU'RE

2390
00:59:38,933 --> 00:59:39,633
