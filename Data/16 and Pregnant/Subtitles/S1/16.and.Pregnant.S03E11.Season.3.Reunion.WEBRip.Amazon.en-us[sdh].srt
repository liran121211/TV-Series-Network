00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,655
TO HAVE SEX.

191
00:04:52,655 --> 00:04:53,724
AND, OF COURSE, PREVENTION WILL

192
00:04:53,724 --> 00:04:55,068
BE A BIG TOPIC THROUGHOUT

193
00:04:55,068 --> 00:04:56,206

JORDAN.

197
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:04,310
NOW, THERE WAS A BIT OF A POWER

198
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,482
STRUGGLE BETWEEN SHE AND HER

199
00:05:05,482 --> 00:05:07,172
TWIN SISTER AND HER BABY'S

200
00:05:07,172 --> 00:05:07,965
FATHER.

209
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:22,724
WHY DID THEY HAPPEN?

210
00:05:22,724 --> 00:05:24,758
>> HE SAID HE WILL HAVE ME IN

211
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:27,689
JAIL AND RAPED.

212
00:05:27,689 --> 00:05:29,206
>> MY PHONE WAS DEAD.

213
00:05:29,206 --> 00:05:30,172

00:06:41,551 --> 00:06:43,379
HALF OF TEEN MOMS DON'T HAVE

259
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:44,551
THEIR PARTNERS.

260
00:06:44,551 --> 00:06:45,379
EIGHT OUT OF TEN DON'T GET

261
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:46,551

 PREGNANT.

270
00:06:57,965 --> 00:06:58,896
>> THE DECISION THAT YOU TWO

271
00:06:58,896 --> 00:07:00,551
MADE AFFECTS EVERYONE,

272
00:07:00,551 --> 00:07:01,413
ALL YOUR FAMILY.

273
00:07:01,413 --> 00:07:02,379
>> I KNOW.

274
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:03,379
>> IT'S HARD FOR ME TO BOND WITH

275
00:07:03,379 --> 00:07:04,862
YOU WHEN YOUR TWIN SISTER IS

276
00:07:04,862 --> 00:07:05,724
ALWAYS THERE.

277
00:07:05,724 --> 00:07:06,689
>> YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW

278
00:07:06,689 --> 00:07:08,310
CLOSE WE WERE.

279
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,137
>> YOUR LIFE PRETTY MUCH

280
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,482
REVOLVES AROUND HIM.

281
00:07:10,482 --> 00:07:11,517
>> NO, IT DOESN'T.

282
00:07:11,517 --> 00:07:12,551
>> YEAH, IT DOES.

283
00:07:12,551 --> 00:07:13,310
>> NO, IT REVOLVES AROUND MY

00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:14,862
BABY.

285
00:07:14,862 --> 00:07:15,758
WHEN WILL I, LIKE, BE ABLE

286
00:07:15,758 --> 00:07:17,137
TO TAKE MY GED?

287
00:07:17,137 --> 00:07:17,931
>> GOT A LITTLE BIT OF WORK TO

288
00:07:17,931 --> 00:07:21,000
DO, BUT HANG IN THERE.

289
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
>> OH!

290
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,724
>> THERE'S MY GIRL.

291
00:07:26,724 --> 00:07:28,000
>> WHAT IF IT WAS ME THAT HAD

292
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,034
THE BABY, AND I HAD MY BOYFRIEND

293
00:07:30,034 --> 00:07:31,379
LIVING HERE, AND YOU DIDN'T

294
00:07:31,379 --> 00:07:32,551
NEED ME?

295
00:07:32,551 --> 00:07:33,827
>> I DO NEED YOU, JESSICA, BUT I

296
00:07:33,827 --> 00:07:35,724
HAVE TO BE A MOM FIRST.

297
00:07:35,724 --> 00:07:38,206
>> OKAY, BE A FRICKIN' MOM!

298
00:07:38,206 --> 00:07:40,965
[baby crying]

299
00:07:40,965 --> 00:07:41,931
>> HE WON'T STOP CRYING BECAUSE

300
00:07:41,931 --> 00:07:43,724
HIS MOUTH IS SO DRY.

301
00:07:43,724 --> 00:07:44,724
>> I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT

302
00:07:44,724 --> 00:07:45,655
TO DO.

303
00:07:45,655 --> 00:07:47,000
>> I DON'T EITHER.

304
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,137
>> BABIES WITH REFLUX ARE

305
00:07:48,137 --> 00:07:49,068
PROBABLY GOING TO BE A LITTLE

306
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:50,827
BIT MORE HIGH-MAINTENANCE,

307
00:07:50,827 --> 00:07:52,172
BUT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE IT

308
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:52,931
BETTER.

309
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:53,827
>> WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

310
00:07:53,827 --> 00:07:54,655
>> GOING TO SCHOOL.

311
00:07:54,655 --> 00:07:56,034
>> I GAVE UP JUST, LIKE,

312
00:07:56,034 --> 00:07:57,344
FREEDOM.

313
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:58,482
I GAVE UP NOT PLANNING FOR

314
00:07:58,482 --> 00:07:59,793
MY FUTURE.

315
00:07:59,793 --> 00:08:01,000
I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST, LIKE,

316
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,034
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF, LIKE,

317
00:08:02,034 --> 00:08:03,862
EVERYTHING YOU HAVE.

318
00:08:03,862 --> 00:08:04,758
LIKE, I DON'T HAVE ALL THOSE

319
00:08:04,758 --> 00:08:06,000
OPTIONS.

320
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:06,827
>> WELL, DON'T WORRY.

321
00:08:06,827 --> 00:08:07,758
I WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL MY

322
00:08:07,758 --> 00:08:10,862
I WILL TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ALL MY
OPTIONS FOR YOU.

323
00:08:10,862 --> 00:08:14,000
OPTIONS FOR YOU.

324
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
>> BRIAN, WE SAW YOU CRYING

325
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,137
IN THE DELIVERY ROOM.

326
00:08:16,137 --> 00:08:17,413
YOU DESCRIBED THE EXPERIENCE AS

327
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:18,413
INTENSE.

328
00:08:18,413 --> 00:08:19,655
>> YEAH, I MEAN, SEEING

329
00:08:19,655 --> 00:08:21,620
SOMETHING THAT YOU CREATED,

330
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,655
IT'S REALLY NICE.

331
00:08:22,655 --> 00:08:23,551
>> YOU'RE ALMOST CRYING NOW JUST

332
00:08:23,551 --> 00:08:24,689
THINKING ABOUT IT.

333
00:08:24,689 --> 00:08:26,413
JORDAN, WE SAW IN YOUR EPISODE

334
00:08:26,413 --> 00:08:29,068
YOUR GRANDMOTHER LECTURING YOU

335
00:08:29,068 --> 00:08:29,896
ON THE DANGERS OF PREMARITAL

336
00:08:29,896 --> 00:08:30,551
SEX.

337
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:31,379
SHE WOULDN'T EVEN LET YOU GUYS

338
00:08:31,379 --> 00:08:32,448
SHARE A BLANKET, AS I RECALL.

339
00:08:32,448 --> 00:08:33,172
>> YEAH.

340
00:08:33,172 --> 00:08:34,000
>> AS YOU THINK BACK ON IT,

341
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,896
WHAT MIGHT YOU HAVE DONE

342
00:08:34,896 --> 00:08:36,068
DIFFERENTLY?

343
00:08:36,068 --> 00:08:37,068
>> I WOULD HAVE TAKEN BIRTH

344
00:08:37,068 --> 00:08:38,068
CONTROL A LOT BETTER.

345
00:08:38,068 --> 00:08:39,482
WAITED A LOT LONGER, UNTIL I WAS

346
00:08:39,482 --> 00:08:40,586
ON IT FOR AT LEAST A COUPLE

347
00:08:40,586 --> 00:08:41,413
MONTHS.

348
00:08:41,413 --> 00:08:42,241
>> WERE YOU TRYING TO BRING HIM

349
00:08:42,241 --> 00:08:44,448
CLOSER TO YOU, OR WAS THERE...

350
00:08:44,448 --> 00:08:45,586
>> YEAH, I MEAN, I HAVE THIS,

351
00:08:45,586 --> 00:08:46,793
LIKE, SECURITY THING ABOUT

352
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,689
PEOPLE LEAVING ME.

353
00:08:48,689 --> 00:08:50,206
>> THIS IS BECAUSE OF YOUR MOM?

354
00:08:50,206 --> 00:08:51,827
>> AND MY DAD AND MY BROTHERS.

355
00:08:51,827 --> 00:08:55,000
>> SO THE TWINS WERE LEFT WITH

356
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,689
YOUR GRANDMA?

357
00:08:55,689 --> 00:08:57,413
>> YEAH.

358
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:59,344
I WAS NINE WHEN I GOT ADOPTED.

359
00:08:59,344 --> 00:09:01,689
>> THAT'S PRETTY HEAVY.

360
00:09:01,689 --> 00:09:05,689
>> MY MOM'S IN FLORIDA,

361
00:09:05,689 --> 00:09:07,448
AND MY DAD'S IN TENNESSEE,

362
00:09:07,448 --> 00:09:09,068
AND MY BROTHERS ARE, LIKE, THREE

363
00:09:09,068 --> 00:09:10,827
HOURS AWAY, AND, LIKE, WE ALL

364
00:09:10,827 --> 00:09:12,517
WERE TOGETHER AT ONCE,

365
00:09:12,517 --> 00:09:15,000
AND THEY JUST KIND OF, LIKE, ALL

366
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,655
GOT UP AND LEFT.

367
00:09:16,655 --> 00:09:17,448
>> HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN THAT

368
00:09:17,448 --> 00:09:18,275
HAPPENED?

369
00:09:18,275 --> 00:09:21,793
>> I WAS NINE, EIGHT.

370
00:09:21,793 --> 00:09:23,137
NINE WHEN I GOT ADOPTED.

371
00:09:23,137 --> 00:09:26,517
I WENT TO LIVE WITH MY AUNTS

372
00:09:26,517 --> 00:09:28,000
FOR A WHILE AND...

373
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,689
>> DID YOU BLAME YOURSELF

374
00:09:28,689 --> 00:09:29,758
AS A CHILD?

375
00:09:29,758 --> 00:09:31,206
>> I MEAN, SORT OF.

376
00:09:31,206 --> 00:09:32,482
I MEAN...

377
00:09:32,482 --> 00:09:33,310
>> THAT'S WHAT CHILDREN DO.

378
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:34,310
EIGHT-YEAR-OLD CHILDREN FEEL

379
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,206
LIKE THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR

380
00:09:35,206 --> 00:09:36,482
EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO THEM.

381
00:09:36,482 --> 00:09:37,413
SO IF A FAMILY BREAKS UP OR THEY

382
00:09:37,413 --> 00:09:39,000
GET ABUSE OR ABANDONED, THEY

383
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,896
BLAME THEMSELVES, RIGHT?

384
00:09:40,896 --> 00:09:43,310
>> YEAH, AND JUST MY MOM GOT

385
00:09:43,310 --> 00:09:44,482
PREGNANT AS A TEENAGER RIGHT OUT

386
00:09:44,482 --> 00:09:47,413
OF HIGH SCHOOL, AND...

387
00:09:47,413 --> 00:09:48,551
THEN SHE GOT PREGNANT AGAIN

388
00:09:48,551 --> 00:09:50,344
AND AGAIN.

389
00:09:50,344 --> 00:09:52,724
>> AND SO WHAT WAS YOUR PLAN?

390
00:09:52,724 --> 00:09:55,344
>> UH, NOT TO GET PREGNANT.

391
00:09:55,344 --> 00:09:56,275
>> OOPS.

392
00:09:56,275 --> 00:09:57,137
>> YEAH.

393
00:09:57,137 --> 00:09:58,137
>> IT'S FUNNY HOW WE RE-CREATE

394
00:09:58,137 --> 00:09:59,551
THE PAST, ISN'T IT?

395
00:09:59,551 --> 00:10:01,068
>> YEAH, NOT EVEN KNOWING IT.

396
00:10:01,068 --> 00:10:01,793
>> WHAT IS THE PLAN?

397
00:10:01,793 --> 00:10:03,551
YOU'RE NOT WORKING ANYMORE,

398
00:10:03,551 --> 00:10:04,241
RIGHT?

399
00:10:04,241 --> 00:10:05,517
YOU WERE MODELING?

400
00:10:05,517 --> 00:10:06,241
YOU WERE GOING TO SCHOOL?

401
00:10:06,241 --> 00:10:08,172
>> YEAH, I GOT MY GED.

402
00:10:08,172 --> 00:10:09,413
>> AND WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS?

403
00:10:09,413 --> 00:10:10,620
>> UM, AS OF RIGHT NOW, I'M

404
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:12,241
ACTUALLY ENLISTING IN THE AIR

405
00:10:12,241 --> 00:10:13,275
FORCE.

406
00:10:13,275 --> 00:10:14,000
>> WHERE DO YOU LIVE NOW?

407
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,586
>> IN MISSOURI. ST. LOUIS.

408
00:10:15,586 --> 00:10:16,241
>> WITH...

409
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:16,931
>> WITH HER GRANDMA.

410
00:10:16,931 --> 00:10:17,620
>> WITH YOUR GRANDMA.

411
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:18,448
SO IN THE HOUSE WITH YOUR

412
00:10:18,448 --> 00:10:19,206
SISTER.

413
00:10:19,206 --> 00:10:20,206
DOES THAT CAUSE TENSION?

414
00:10:20,206 --> 00:10:22,344
>> UH, SOMETIMES.

415
00:10:22,344 --> 00:10:23,103
NOT ANYMORE.

416
00:10:23,103 --> 00:10:23,965
>> WE SAW A LITTLE BIT OF IT ON

417
00:10:23,965 --> 00:10:24,793
YOUR EPISODE.

418
00:10:24,793 --> 00:10:25,689
YOUR SISTER WAS FEELING JEALOUS

419
00:10:25,689 --> 00:10:26,448
AND LEFT OUT.

420
00:10:26,448 --> 00:10:27,517
>> YEAH.

421
00:10:27,517 --> 00:10:28,517
I MEAN, I'D PROBABLY BE THE SAME

422
00:10:28,517 --> 00:10:29,482
WAY IF I WAS HER.

423
00:10:29,482 --> 00:10:30,517
>> WELL, JESSICA, OF COURSE, IS

424
00:10:30,517 --> 00:10:32,000
HERE, SO SHOULD WE TALK TO HER?

425
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:32,862
>> YEAH.

426
00:10:32,862 --> 00:10:34,620
>> LET'S BRING HER OUT.

427
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:39,758
[applause]

428
00:10:39,758 --> 00:10:40,724
>> HELLO.

429
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:41,413
>> JESSICA, THANKS FOR

430
00:10:41,413 --> 00:10:42,724
JOINING US.

431
00:10:42,724 --> 00:10:43,482
SO YOU HEARD WHAT WE'VE BEEN

432
00:10:43,482 --> 00:10:44,241
TALKING ABOUT.

433
00:10:44,241 --> 00:10:44,965
HOW HAS THIS BEEN FOR YOU?

434
00:10:44,965 --> 00:10:47,000
>> UM, REALLY EMOTIONAL, BUT...

435
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,034
>> YOU SEEM EVEN EMOTIONAL NOW.

436
00:10:48,034 --> 00:10:49,000
>> YEAH.

437
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
>> WHY?

438
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,931
>> SEEING HER CRY MADE ME CRY,

439
00:10:50,931 --> 00:10:51,655
SO...

440
00:10:51,655 --> 00:10:54,517
>> ABOUT YOUR CHILDHOOD STUFF.

441
00:10:54,517 --> 00:10:55,413
DO YOU FEEL RESPONSIBLE FOR

442
00:10:55,413 --> 00:10:56,689
BEING ABANDONED?

443
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:57,931
>> KIND OF.

444
00:10:57,931 --> 00:10:58,724
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY

445
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,344
LEFT, SO...

446
00:11:00,344 --> 00:11:02,862
IT WAS JUST...

447
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:03,931
DIFFICULT.

448
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:05,379
>> YEAH.

449
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:06,931
NOW THAT JORDAN HAS HAD A BABY,

450
00:11:06,931 --> 00:11:09,689
DOES IT THREATEN THAT SPECIAL

451
00:11:09,689 --> 00:11:10,862
BOND YOU GUYS HAD?

452
00:11:10,862 --> 00:11:12,896
>> WELL, AT FIRST 'CAUSE SHE GOT

453
00:11:12,896 --> 00:11:14,137
PREGNANT AT FIVE MONTHS--

454
00:11:14,137 --> 00:11:15,000
THEY WERE ONLY TOGETHER FOR,

455
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,068
LIKE, FIVE OR SIX MONTHS.

456
00:11:16,068 --> 00:11:17,758
>> DID YOU NOT TRUST HIM?

457
00:11:17,758 --> 00:11:18,758
>> KIND OF, YEAH.

458
00:11:18,758 --> 00:11:20,000
I WAS SCARED FOR HER.

459
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,758
BUT NOW I'M, LIKE, REALLY HAPPY

460
00:11:21,758 --> 00:11:23,344
FOR HER BECAUSE SHE'S MARRIED,

461
00:11:23,344 --> 00:11:25,793
AND BRIAN'S, LIKE, A WONDERFUL

462
00:11:25,793 --> 00:11:26,655
DAD.

463
00:11:26,655 --> 00:11:27,551
>> YOU GUYS ARE SO ENMESHED AND

464
00:11:27,551 --> 00:11:28,827
SO TIGHT, AND YOU HAD TO RELY

465
00:11:28,827 --> 00:11:30,000
ON EACH OTHER SO MUCH,

466
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,965
IT'S VERY THREATENING TO HAVE

467
00:11:30,965 --> 00:11:32,689
SUDDENLY THIS DUDE SHOW UP.

468
00:11:32,689 --> 00:11:34,172
DID YOU FEEL ANY OF THAT, BRIAN?

469
00:11:34,172 --> 00:11:36,344
>> EVEN BESIDES THEM BEING

470
00:11:36,344 --> 00:11:38,448
TWINS, HER GRANDPARENTS WITH

471
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,310
THEM ARE VERY CLOSE, AND I WAS

472
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,000
JUST KIND OF THROWN INTO IT.

473
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,586
I'M THE GUY WHO KNOCKED UP THEIR

474
00:11:44,586 --> 00:11:46,620
LITTLE GIRL.

475
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,034
SO...

476
00:11:48,034 --> 00:11:49,206
>> HOW DOES YOUR FAMILY TAKE ALL

477
00:11:49,206 --> 00:11:49,896
THIS?

478
00:11:49,896 --> 00:11:51,827
>> MY PARENTS WERE ALSO TEEN

479
00:11:51,827 --> 00:11:52,482
PARENTS.

480
00:11:52,482 --> 00:11:54,000
MY MOM GOT PREGNANT AT 19

481
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,724
AND GOT MARRIED RIGHT AWAY,

482
00:11:56,724 --> 00:11:58,724
BUT THEY ENDED UP SEPARATING.

483
00:11:58,724 --> 00:11:59,724
>> ALL RIGHT, SO WE HAVE--

484
00:11:59,724 --> 00:12:00,551
YOU'RE A PRODUCT OF TEEN

485
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:01,862
PARENTING.

486
00:12:01,862 --> 00:12:03,379
YOU'VE GOT ABANDONMENT.

487
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:05,344
HOW DID YOU NOT FALL INTO THE

488
00:12:05,344 --> 00:12:06,793
SAME PATTERN?

489
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:07,724
>> I'M THE FIRST ONE OUT OF MY

490
00:12:07,724 --> 00:12:08,758
WHOLE FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE,

491
00:12:08,758 --> 00:12:09,758
SO--

492
00:12:09,758 --> 00:12:11,482
>> WHY DOES THAT MAKE YOU SAD?

493
00:12:11,482 --> 00:12:12,482
>> I DON'T KNOW.

494
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:13,551
SHE WANTED TO GO TO SCHOOL,

495
00:12:13,551 --> 00:12:15,724
BUT NOW SHE'S A MOM.

496
00:12:15,724 --> 00:12:16,931
>> SO YOU'VE GOT TO DO IT FOR

497
00:12:16,931 --> 00:12:17,655
HER.

498
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:18,482
>> WELL, YEAH, I'M DOING IT FOR

499
00:12:18,482 --> 00:12:19,551
HER.

500
00:12:19,551 --> 00:12:20,689
I WANT TO, LIKE, SHOW HER THAT

501
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:21,620
WE COULD HAVE DONE IT,

502
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:22,655
AND SHE COULD HAVE DONE IT,

503
00:12:22,655 --> 00:12:24,137
BUT...

504
00:12:24,137 --> 00:12:25,000
>> ARE YOU JEALOUS?

505
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,034
>> THAT SHE'S MOVING ON WITH HER

506
00:12:27,034 --> 00:12:27,931
LIFE?

507
00:12:27,931 --> 00:12:29,586
UH, A LITTLE, YEAH.

508
00:12:29,586 --> 00:12:33,137
I MEAN, I'M...

509
00:12:33,137 --> 00:12:37,689
A STAY-AT-HOME MOM.

510
00:12:37,689 --> 00:12:39,965
>> WHY ARE YOU CRYING?

511
00:12:39,965 --> 00:12:42,310
>> I JUST DON'T WANT TO RELY

512
00:12:42,310 --> 00:12:43,103
ON BRIAN.

513
00:12:43,103 --> 00:12:44,517
I MEAN, SURE HE'S MY HUSBAND,

514
00:12:44,517 --> 00:12:45,413
BUT I WANT TO MAKE SOMETHING OF

515
00:12:45,413 --> 00:12:46,655
MYSELF.

516
00:12:46,655 --> 00:12:48,206
AND I FEEL LIKE I CAN'T BECAUSE

517
00:12:48,206 --> 00:12:49,689
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE NOAH WITH

518
00:12:49,689 --> 00:12:50,862
SOMEONE I DON'T KNOW.

519
00:12:50,862 --> 00:12:52,344
>> AGAIN, FOR THE PURPOSES OF

520
00:12:52,344 --> 00:12:53,275
PEOPLE AT HOME, THOUGH, WOULDN'T

521
00:12:53,275 --> 00:12:55,000
YOU SAY THAT BEING A TEEN MOM...

522
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,310
>> IS VERY HARD.

523
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,448
>> YOU KNOW, THE ONE THING THAT

524
00:12:58,448 --> 00:12:59,379
I KEEP SEEING OVER AND OVER

525
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:01,034
AGAIN IN THIS PROGRAM

526
00:13:01,034 --> 00:13:03,068
PARTICULARLY, IS KIDS SAYING,

527
00:13:03,068 --> 00:13:03,931
"OH, YES.

528
00:13:03,931 --> 00:13:04,655
I'M GOING TO GO TO GRADUATE

529
00:13:04,655 --> 00:13:05,310
SCHOOL; I'M GOING TO GET

530
00:13:05,310 --> 00:13:06,000
A PROFESSIONAL DEGREE;

531
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,379
I'M GOING TO RAISE MY BABY."

532
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:08,931
HOW REALISTIC IS ALL THAT?

533
00:13:08,931 --> 00:13:10,413
>> IT'S LIKE--

534
00:13:10,413 --> 00:13:11,551
OUR PLANS HAVE CHANGED

535
00:13:11,551 --> 00:13:13,241
DRASTICALLY BECAUSE, I MEAN,

536
00:13:13,241 --> 00:13:14,551
FOR HIM TO GO TO COLLEGE, THAT

537
00:13:14,551 --> 00:13:16,448
COSTS MONEY, AND WE CAN'T JUST

538
00:13:16,448 --> 00:13:17,379
DO STUDENT LOANS.

539
00:13:17,379 --> 00:13:18,379
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PAY THAT

540
00:13:18,379 --> 00:13:19,172
BACK.

541
00:13:19,172 --> 00:13:20,448
SO AIR FORCE WAS, LIKE, THE BEST

542
00:13:20,448 --> 00:13:21,413
THING FOR US.

543
00:13:21,413 --> 00:13:22,068
>> RIGHT.

544
00:13:22,068 --> 00:13:22,862
SO THE REALITIES OF HAVING A

545
00:13:22,862 --> 00:13:25,172
BABY ROB YOU OF A LOT OF

546
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:27,172
OPTIONS, 'CAUSE MAKING THINGS

547
00:13:27,172 --> 00:13:28,931
HAPPEN TAKE A LOT OF WORK,

548
00:13:28,931 --> 00:13:30,068
A LOT OF PLANNING, A LOT OF

549
00:13:30,068 --> 00:13:31,620
STRUCTURE, A LOT OF EDUCATION.

550
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:33,034
>> TAKES TIME.

551
00:13:33,034 --> 00:13:34,448
>> WELL, JORDAN, BRIAN, JESSICA,

552
00:13:34,448 --> 00:13:35,620
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING

553
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,275
HERE.

554
00:13:36,275 --> 00:13:37,103
JORDAN IS, OF COURSE, GOING TO

555
00:13:37,103 --> 00:13:38,000
BE BACK LATER TO CHAT WITH ALL

556
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,137
THE OTHER YOUNG MOMS.

557
00:13:39,137 --> 00:13:40,344
IN A MOMENT, WE'RE GOING TO

558
00:13:40,344 --> 00:13:41,482
RETURN WITH JENNIFER AND HER

559
00:13:41,482 --> 00:13:42,620
DAD.

560
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:44,827
AS IF HAVING TWINS WASN'T ENOUGH

561
00:13:44,827 --> 00:13:46,551
WORK, JENNIFER HAS ALSO HAD TO

562
00:13:46,551 --> 00:13:48,448
DEAL WITH THE ARREST OF THEIR

563
00:13:48,448 --> 00:13:49,724
FATHER, JOSH.

564
00:13:49,724 --> 00:13:51,000
SO WHERE DOES THIS ALL STAND

565
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:51,758
RIGHT NOW?

566
00:13:51,758 --> 00:13:52,413
YOU'RE GOING TO FIND OUT

567
00:13:52,413 --> 00:13:53,827
WHEN WE COME BACK.

568
00:13:53,827 --> 00:13:56,758
WHEN WE COME BACK.

[applause]

571

>> I'M DR. DREW, AND THIS IS

 LIFE AFTER LABOR: THE 16 AND

 PREGNANT FINALE SPECIAL.

574
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:12,931
NOW, BEFORE WE GO ON, I WANT TO

575
00:14:12,931 --> 00:14:14,137
REMIND OUR VIEWERS TO GO TO

TAKE CONTROL OF YOUR SEX LIFE.

580
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:22,586
NOW, ALL TEN OF THIS SEASON'S

581
00:14:22,586 --> 00:14:24,482
YOUNG MOMS HAD THEIR HANDS FULL,

582
00:14:24,482 --> 00:14:26,103
NEED I SAY, TAKING CARE OF A NEW

583
00:14:26,103 --> 00:14:28,034
BABY, BUT ONLY JENNIFER HAD TO

584
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,586
DEAL WITH TWINS.

585
00:14:29,586 --> 00:14:30,793
WELL, THERE'S A LOT TO TALK

586
00:14:30,793 --> 00:14:31,689
ABOUT, OBVIOUSLY.

587
00:14:31,689 --> 00:14:32,724
FIRST, THOUGH, I WANT TO TAKE A

588
00:14:32,724 --> 00:14:38,000
LOOK BACK AT HER STORY.

589
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,172
>> SO DO YOU GUYS ALREADY KNOW

590
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:39,965
WHAT YOU'RE HAVING?

591
00:14:39,965 --> 00:14:40,862
>> TWO BOYS.

592
00:14:40,862 --> 00:14:42,689
>> TWO BOYS? OH.

593
00:14:42,689 --> 00:14:43,448
>> DID YOU EVER THINK, A YEAR

594
00:14:43,448 --> 00:14:44,344
LATER, I'D BE SHOWING A CRIB?

595
00:14:44,344 --> 00:14:45,379
>> NO.

596
00:14:45,379 --> 00:14:46,862
>> IT'S LIKE, "DUDE, YOU KNOW,

597
00:14:46,862 --> 00:14:48,275
YOU GOT MY DAUGHTER PREGNANT.

598
00:14:48,275 --> 00:14:49,172
YOU'RE LUCKY YOU'RE STANDING IN

599
00:14:49,172 --> 00:14:50,034
FRONT OF ME."

600
00:14:50,034 --> 00:14:52,206
>> YOU'RE ONLY 16 YEARS OLD,

601
00:14:52,206 --> 00:14:54,103
AND IF HE DOESN'T GET THAT,

602
00:14:54,103 --> 00:14:55,034
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BUMP

603
00:14:55,034 --> 00:14:56,103
HEADS.

604
00:14:56,103 --> 00:14:58,137
>> THE PERSON THAT I LOVE AND MY

605
00:14:58,137 --> 00:15:01,482
OWN FAMILY ARE FIGHTING.

606
00:15:01,482 --> 00:15:02,413
>> YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

607
00:15:02,413 --> 00:15:04,068
MAKE A CHOICE.

608
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:05,586
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

609
00:15:05,586 --> 00:15:08,655
>> OF COURSE I WILL.

610
00:15:08,655 --> 00:15:09,965
>> DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO

611
00:15:09,965 --> 00:15:11,517
MAKE THIS HAPPEN BECAUSE THE

612
00:15:11,517 --> 00:15:12,724
CHILDREN ARE COMING?

613
00:15:12,724 --> 00:15:13,655
>> NO.

614
00:15:13,655 --> 00:15:14,448
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

615
00:15:14,448 --> 00:15:16,103
OUTCOME'S GOING TO BE.

616
00:15:16,103 --> 00:15:20,034
>> [cooing]

617
00:15:20,034 --> 00:15:21,172
>> THE LAST NAME FOR THE BABY,

618
00:15:21,172 --> 00:15:22,206
SAME AS THE DAD'S?

619
00:15:22,206 --> 00:15:25,241
>> YES.

620
00:15:25,241 --> 00:15:27,379
>> YOU NEED TO MEET ME HALFWAY.

621
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:28,551
>> THEY'RE NOT YOUR KIDS.

622
00:15:28,551 --> 00:15:29,586
I DON'T HAVE TO MEET YOU

623
00:15:29,586 --> 00:15:30,551
HALFWAY.

624
00:15:30,551 --> 00:15:31,896
>> YOU SIT THERE AND YOU ARGUE

625
00:15:31,896 --> 00:15:34,965
WITH MY PARENTS.

626
00:15:34,965 --> 00:15:36,379
I'M TRYING TO KEEP YOU WARM

627
00:15:36,379 --> 00:15:38,000
FOR A SECOND.

628
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:38,862
SOMETHING YOUR DAD SHOULD BE

629
00:15:38,862 --> 00:15:40,689
HELPING OUT ON.

630
00:15:40,689 --> 00:15:42,034
I'M DONE.

631
00:15:42,034 --> 00:15:42,827
>> YOU WANT OUT OF THIS

632
00:15:42,827 --> 00:15:43,586
RELATIONSHIP, JENNIFER?

633
00:15:43,586 --> 00:15:46,137
>> YEAH. I DO.

634
00:15:46,137 --> 00:15:49,000
OKAY, JUST FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

635
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:52,275
YOU'RE GOING TO JAIL!

636
00:15:52,275 --> 00:15:53,827
SAY GOOD-BYE TO YOUR KIDS, JOSH.

637
00:15:53,827 --> 00:15:56,724
YOU WILL NEVER, EVER SEE THEM

638
00:15:56,724 --> 00:15:57,827
AGAIN!

639
00:15:57,827 --> 00:15:59,896
AGAIN!
[siren wailing]

640
00:15:59,896 --> 00:16:04,413
[siren wailing]

641
00:16:04,413 --> 00:16:05,241
>> HOW DO YOU FEEL WHEN YOU

642
00:16:05,241 --> 00:16:07,931
WATCH THAT FOOTAGE?

643
00:16:07,931 --> 00:16:09,000
>> IT HURTS.

644
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,448
>> HURTS.

645
00:16:11,448 --> 00:16:16,413
MM.

646
00:16:16,413 --> 00:16:20,310
>> HE WAS, FOR A WHOLE YEAR--

647
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:25,517
WAS MY BEST FRIEND.

648
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:29,206
WE DID EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

649
00:16:29,206 --> 00:16:30,724
>> BUT THAT'S THE GUY CAPABLE

650
00:16:30,724 --> 00:16:31,862
OF DOING THAT.

651
00:16:31,862 --> 00:16:34,275
>> MM-HMM.

652
00:16:34,275 --> 00:16:36,344
I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD GO THAT

653
00:16:36,344 --> 00:16:37,241
FAR.

654
00:16:37,241 --> 00:16:40,241
I NEVER THOUGHT HE WOULD DRIVE

655
00:16:40,241 --> 00:16:41,655
OFF WITH THEM.

656
00:16:41,655 --> 00:16:42,896
>> SO YOU'RE TELLING US YOU KNEW

657
00:16:42,896 --> 00:16:43,965
A DIFFERENT PERSON.

658
00:16:43,965 --> 00:16:45,000
>> YEAH.

659
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,620
HE WAS A COMPLETE DIFFERENT

660
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:49,344
PERSON.

661
00:16:49,344 --> 00:16:50,137
>> YOUR PARENTS KNEW YOU WERE

662
00:16:50,137 --> 00:16:51,172
SEXUALLY ACTIVE.

663
00:16:51,172 --> 00:16:52,000
>> MM-HMM.

664
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,517
MY MOM DID.

665
00:16:53,517 --> 00:16:54,344
>> AND SHE TOOK YOU TO GET BIRTH

666
00:16:54,344 --> 00:16:55,172
CONTROL.

667
00:16:55,172 --> 00:16:56,103
>> SHE TOOK ME TO THE DOCTOR AND

668
00:16:56,103 --> 00:16:59,000
HAS DEFINITELY GIVEN ME OPTIONS.

669
00:16:59,000 --> 00:16:59,896
>> HOW'S YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH

670
00:16:59,896 --> 00:17:01,689
YOUR FAMILY NOW?

671
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:03,068
>> I WOULD SAY IT'S PROBABLY

672
00:17:03,068 --> 00:17:03,965
STRONGER.

673
00:17:03,965 --> 00:17:05,413
>> STRONGER AS A RESULT.

674
00:17:05,413 --> 00:17:06,241
ALL RIGHT.

675
00:17:06,241 --> 00:17:07,206
SO WHY DON'T WE BRING YOUR DAD

676
00:17:07,206 --> 00:17:08,034
OUT AND HAVE FURTHER

677
00:17:08,034 --> 00:17:08,965
CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS, OKAY?

678
00:17:08,965 --> 00:17:09,620
>> OKAY.

679
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:10,379
>> OKAY, LET'S BRING OUT HER

680
00:17:10,379 --> 00:17:11,034
FATHER.

681
00:17:11,034 --> 00:17:11,758
HE'S HERE WITH US.

682
00:17:11,758 --> 00:17:12,931
RICO, COME ON OUT.

683
00:17:12,931 --> 00:17:17,379
[applause]

684
00:17:17,379 --> 00:17:18,551
>> HEY, DR. DREW.

685
00:17:18,551 --> 00:17:21,551
>> RICO.

686
00:17:21,551 --> 00:17:23,206
SO WHAT'S YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON

687
00:17:23,206 --> 00:17:23,896
ALL OF THIS?

688
00:17:23,896 --> 00:17:25,000
I MEAN, THIS IS A PRETTY--

689
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,379
A LOT TO TAKE, A LOT TO SWALLOW.

690
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,724
>> YES.

691
00:17:27,724 --> 00:17:30,034
I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS SEXUALLY

692
00:17:30,034 --> 00:17:32,137
ACTIVE.

693
00:17:32,137 --> 00:17:33,241
KIND OF A SHOCK.

694
00:17:33,241 --> 00:17:34,068
>> IT'S HARD TO TALK ABOUT THIS

695
00:17:34,068 --> 00:17:35,448
STUFF, EVEN WHEN PARENTS ARE

696
00:17:35,448 --> 00:17:36,379
OPEN AND TALKING ABOUT IT.

697
00:17:36,379 --> 00:17:37,551
IT IS UNCOMFORTABLE FOR

698
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:38,275
EVERYBODY.

699
00:17:38,275 --> 00:17:39,551
IT'S A HARD TOPIC.

700
00:17:39,551 --> 00:17:40,551
>> YOU JUST DON'T IMAGINE YOUR

701
00:17:40,551 --> 00:17:43,551
LITTLE GIRL, AT 16,

702
00:17:43,551 --> 00:17:46,931
PARTICIPATING IN THAT.

703
00:17:46,931 --> 00:17:47,793
>> SO YOU WEREN'T AWARE THAT SHE

704
00:17:47,793 --> 00:17:48,655
WAS SEXUALLY ACTIVE, BUT SHE

705
00:17:48,655 --> 00:17:50,586
SAID HER MOM WAS.

706
00:17:50,586 --> 00:17:51,413
>> I WOULD SAY THAT'S PROBABLY

707
00:17:51,413 --> 00:17:52,379
TRUE.

708
00:17:52,379 --> 00:17:54,103
IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I, YOU

709
00:17:54,103 --> 00:17:56,482
KNOW, TALKED ABOUT THAT OPENLY.

710
00:17:56,482 --> 00:17:58,758
MAYBE IF I WAS MORE INVOLVED,

711
00:17:58,758 --> 00:18:00,275
IF I WOULD HAVE TALKED MORE...

712
00:18:00,275 --> 00:18:01,000
>> YOU COULD HAVE MADE A

713
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,689
DIFFERENCE.

714
00:18:01,689 --> 00:18:02,586
>> COULD HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE.

715
00:18:02,586 --> 00:18:03,241
I DON'T KNOW.

716
00:18:03,241 --> 00:18:03,931
>> SO YOU REGRET.

717
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:04,586
>> YES.

718
00:18:04,586 --> 00:18:05,275
>> WHAT ACTUALLY WERE YOU

719
00:18:05,275 --> 00:18:06,137
TALKING WITH YOUR MOM ABOUT?

720
00:18:06,137 --> 00:18:07,344
"MOM, I'M SEXUALLY ACTIVE;

721
00:18:07,344 --> 00:18:08,275
I NEED TO HAVE BIRTH CONTROL"?

722
00:18:08,275 --> 00:18:08,965
OR...

723
00:18:08,965 --> 00:18:09,758
>> UM, NO.

724
00:18:09,758 --> 00:18:10,482
>> NO? OKAY.

725
00:18:10,482 --> 00:18:12,413
SO WHAT WAS THE CONVERSATION?

726
00:18:12,413 --> 00:18:14,620
>> I GUESS SOMEBODY MENTIONED

727
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,068
SOMETHING TO HER, AND SHE

728
00:18:17,068 --> 00:18:17,758
FOUND OUT.

729
00:18:17,758 --> 00:18:18,689
>> SO SHE WAS AWARE.

730
00:18:18,689 --> 00:18:19,517
YOU WEREN'T ACTUALLY TALKING

731
00:18:19,517 --> 00:18:20,172
ABOUT IT, THOUGH.

732
00:18:20,172 --> 00:18:21,034
>> MM-HMM.

733
00:18:21,034 --> 00:18:22,379
>> IF YOU'D HAD THAT

734
00:18:22,379 --> 00:18:23,655
CONVERSATION WITH YOUR MOM,

735
00:18:23,655 --> 00:18:27,344
WHAT DO YOU WISH SHE'D SAID?

736
00:18:27,344 --> 00:18:30,551
>> TELL HER TO TAKE ME TO GO GET

737
00:18:30,551 --> 00:18:33,310
BIRTH CONTROL OR GO OVER OPTIONS

738
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:35,827
FOR ME.

739
00:18:35,827 --> 00:18:36,896
>> WERE YOU AFRAID OF HOW YOUR

740
00:18:36,896 --> 00:18:38,310
PARENTS WERE GOING TO REACT?

741
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:40,206
>> MM-HMM.

742
00:18:40,206 --> 00:18:41,620
>> HAVE THERE BEEN FURTHER

743
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,448
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT BIRTH

744
00:18:42,448 --> 00:18:43,448
CONTROL?

745
00:18:43,448 --> 00:18:45,206
>> NO, NOT--I MEAN, MY MOM TELLS

746
00:18:45,206 --> 00:18:48,172
ME, WHEN I'M READY, SHE WILL

747
00:18:48,172 --> 00:18:50,172
TAKE ME IF I WANT TO...

748
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:51,103
>> WHAT OPTION WOULD YOU BE

749
00:18:51,103 --> 00:18:52,275
LOOKING FOR?

750
00:18:52,275 --> 00:18:53,000
>> THE SHOT.

751
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:53,862
>> YOU WANT DEPO SHOT?

752
00:18:53,862 --> 00:18:54,586
>> PROBABLY.

753
00:18:54,586 --> 00:18:55,379
>> MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO TALK

754
00:18:55,379 --> 00:18:56,034
ABOUT.

755
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:56,931
NO? DAD, YOU DON'T LIKE THAT?

756
00:18:56,931 --> 00:18:58,586
>> AGAIN, THIS IS MY LITTLE

757
00:18:58,586 --> 00:18:59,448
GIRL.

758
00:18:59,448 --> 00:19:00,275
>> YEAH.

759
00:19:00,275 --> 00:19:01,206
>> WE'RE SITTING HERE

760
00:19:01,206 --> 00:19:03,206
DISCUSSING, YOU KNOW, PREGNANCY

761
00:19:03,206 --> 00:19:04,448
PREVENTION.

762
00:19:04,448 --> 00:19:06,000
THAT MEANS, OBVIOUSLY, SHE'S

763
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,379
CONTEMPLATING SEX,

764
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:08,758
SO, YOU KNOW...

765
00:19:08,758 --> 00:19:09,827
BUT AT THIS POINT, YOU KNOW, YOU

766
00:19:09,827 --> 00:19:10,896
GOT TO BE REALISTIC;

767
00:19:10,896 --> 00:19:13,310
IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN, NO MATTER

768
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:15,241
WHAT I SAY.

769
00:19:15,241 --> 00:19:16,103
>> HOW'S THE RELATIONSHIP WITH

770
00:19:16,103 --> 00:19:17,655
JOSH NOW?

771
00:19:17,655 --> 00:19:18,827
>> THINGS ARE CIVIL.

772
00:19:18,827 --> 00:19:19,931
>> DO YOU HARBOR THAT SAME

773
00:19:19,931 --> 00:19:21,068
FANTASY THAT SO MANY OF OUR TEEN

774
00:19:21,068 --> 00:19:22,482
MOMS DO THAT SOMEHOW THIS IS

775
00:19:22,482 --> 00:19:23,275
GOING TO BE A MAGICAL

776
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:24,862
RELATIONSHIP, THAT YOU'RE GOING

777
00:19:24,862 --> 00:19:25,758
TO HAVE YOUR FAMILY TOGETHER

778
00:19:25,758 --> 00:19:27,000
AGAIN?

779
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,793
>> I DID, AND I STILL DO

780
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,620
SOMETIMES, BUT THERE'S STILL

781
00:19:30,620 --> 00:19:32,206
TIMES WHERE, LIKE, LOOKING BACK

782
00:19:32,206 --> 00:19:33,482
AT THAT AND LOOKING BACK AT

783
00:19:33,482 --> 00:19:36,965
PICTURES, I SAY, IF HE CAN

784
00:19:36,965 --> 00:19:38,793
CHANGE, MAYBE.

785
00:19:38,793 --> 00:19:41,000
BUT, YOU KNOW, IT TAKES A STRONG

786
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,517
PERSON, AND IT TAKES A PERSON TO

787
00:19:42,517 --> 00:19:43,827
WANT TO CHANGE.

788
00:19:43,827 --> 00:19:44,827
>> WHAT WAS THAT ALL ABOUT WITH

789
00:19:44,827 --> 00:19:45,482
JOSH?

790
00:19:45,482 --> 00:19:46,241
WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT WAS?

791
00:19:46,241 --> 00:19:47,620
>> I'M NOT GOING TO BASH JOSH

792
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,448
OR SAY ANYTHING, YOU KNOW, BAD

793
00:19:49,448 --> 00:19:51,068
ABOUT HIM, EVEN THOUGH I DON'T

794
00:19:51,068 --> 00:19:52,551
REALLY CARE FOR HIM.

795
00:19:52,551 --> 00:19:55,551
SOME OF WHAT I'VE LEARNED TO TRY

796
00:19:55,551 --> 00:19:58,068
TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT JOSH IS THE

797
00:19:58,068 --> 00:20:00,862
WAY HE WAS, I GUESS, BROUGHT UP,

798
00:20:00,862 --> 00:20:01,862
PARENTING.

799
00:20:01,862 --> 00:20:03,137
I MEAN, IT ALL COMES BACK ON THE

800
00:20:03,137 --> 00:20:03,965
PARENTS.

801
00:20:03,965 --> 00:20:04,793
>> NOW, MY UNDERSTANDING THAT

802
00:20:04,793 --> 00:20:06,206
THERE WERE RESTRAINING ORDERS

803
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:07,586
AND ALL KINDS OF STUFF BETWEEN

804
00:20:07,586 --> 00:20:08,241
YOU AND JOSH.

805
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:09,517
IS THAT CORRECT?

806
00:20:09,517 --> 00:20:10,758
WHY DID THEY HAPPEN?

807
00:20:10,758 --> 00:20:12,827
>> UM, THE FIRST ONE HAPPENED--

808
00:20:12,827 --> 00:20:17,482
I FILED IT THE DAY HE WAS IN

809
00:20:17,482 --> 00:20:18,448
JAIL.

810
00:20:18,448 --> 00:20:19,379
>> OKAY, THAT'S ONE.

811
00:20:19,379 --> 00:20:20,172
I CAN UNDERSTAND THAT.

812
00:20:20,172 --> 00:20:21,827
WHAT WAS THE SECOND ONE?

813
00:20:21,827 --> 00:20:23,655
>> HE SAID HE WILL HAVE ME IN

814
00:20:23,655 --> 00:20:27,103
JAIL AND RAPED.

815
00:20:27,103 --> 00:20:28,724
>> SO HE'S GOING TO SEE TO IT

816
00:20:28,724 --> 00:20:29,724
THAT YOU WERE RAPED IN JAIL?

817
00:20:29,724 --> 00:20:30,793
>> MM-HMM.

818
00:20:30,793 --> 00:20:31,413
>> THAT'S NICE.

819
00:20:31,413 --> 00:20:34,344
>> [chuckles]

820
00:20:34,344 --> 00:20:35,724
>> REALLY DESERVE THAT?

821
00:20:35,724 --> 00:20:37,137
>> NO.

822
00:20:37,137 --> 00:20:40,241
>> I DON'T THINK YOU'RE WORTHY

823
00:20:40,241 --> 00:20:42,931
OF THAT KIND OF ABUSE.

824
00:20:42,931 --> 00:20:43,724
DO YOU?

825
00:20:43,724 --> 00:20:44,379
>> MM-MM.

826
00:20:44,379 --> 00:20:46,034
>> OKAY.

827
00:20:46,034 --> 00:20:46,896
JENNIFER, RICO, THANK YOU FOR

828
00:20:46,896 --> 00:20:47,586
JOINING US.

829
00:20:47,586 --> 00:20:48,413
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK,

830
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,241
AND WE WILL RETURN WITH

831
00:20:49,241 --> 00:20:49,965
DANIELLE.

832
00:20:49,965 --> 00:20:51,172
NOW, SHE, TOO, HAS HAD TONS OF

833
00:20:51,172 --> 00:20:52,172
DRAMA SURROUNDING HER

834
00:20:52,172 --> 00:20:53,206
RELATIONSHIP WITH HER BABY'S

835
00:20:53,206 --> 00:20:53,931
FATHER.

836
00:20:53,931 --> 00:20:55,655
SO WHERE DO SHE AND JAMIE STAND

837
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:56,413
TODAY?

838
00:20:56,413 --> 00:20:57,275
WE'RE GOING TO ASK THEM BOTH.

839
00:20:57,275 --> 00:20:59,275
DON'T GO AWAY.

840
00:20:59,275 --> 00:21:02,137
DON'T GO AWAY.
[applause]

841
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:10,413
[applause]

842
00:21:10,413 --> 00:21:14,206
[applause]

843
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:15,379
>> WE ARE BACK WITH MORE OF THE

844
00:21:15,379 --> 00:21:17,034
 16 AND PREGNANT FINALE SPECIAL,

845
00:21:17,034 --> 00:21:18,620
TALKING WITH TEN YOUNG WOMEN

846
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,275
WITH COMPLICATED LIVES WHO ALL

847
00:21:20,275 --> 00:21:22,275
BECAME PREGNANT IN HIGH SCHOOL.

848
00:21:22,275 --> 00:21:24,000
UP NEXT IS DANIELLE, HERE WITH

849
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,103
HER MOM, CASEY, AND HER BABY'S

850
00:21:26,103 --> 00:21:27,689
FATHER, JAMIE.

851
00:21:27,689 --> 00:21:29,000
LET'S TAKE A LOOK BACK AT

852
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,206
DANIELLE'S EXPERIENCE BEING

853
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,724
DANIELLE'S EXPERIENCE BEING
16 AND PREGNANT.

854
00:21:33,724 --> 00:21:37,000
16 AND PREGNANT.

855
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,862
>> IT'S KIND OF CRAZY WE'RE

856
00:21:37,862 --> 00:21:38,896
GOING TO HAVE A BABY BEFORE OUR

857
00:21:38,896 --> 00:21:40,310
ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY.

858
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,275
>> I KNOW.

859
00:21:41,275 --> 00:21:42,793
>> I WORKED SO HARD TO EMBED IT

860
00:21:42,793 --> 00:21:44,275
IN YOUR HEAD THAT THIS ISN'T

861
00:21:44,275 --> 00:21:46,206
SOMETHING THAT YOU WANTED.

862
00:21:46,206 --> 00:21:47,000
>> HOW MUCH [bleep] DO WE NEED

863
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:47,862
FOR RIGHT NOW?

864
00:21:47,862 --> 00:21:48,724
>> OKAY, WHEN THE BABY'S BORN,

865
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:49,827
WHAT DO WE NEED?

866
00:21:49,827 --> 00:21:50,758
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING

867
00:21:50,758 --> 00:21:53,034
TO DO UNTIL WE GET INTO IT.

868
00:21:53,034 --> 00:21:54,482
>> THAT'S A CONTRACTION.

869
00:21:54,482 --> 00:21:55,482
YEAH, I THINK WE NEED TO GO HAVE

870
00:21:55,482 --> 00:21:56,862
YOU CHECKED OUT.

871
00:21:56,862 --> 00:21:58,413
>> LOOK AT ME.

872
00:21:58,413 --> 00:21:59,724
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

873
00:21:59,724 --> 00:22:01,206
>> THANK YOU.

874
00:22:01,206 --> 00:22:02,965
OH, MY GOD.

875
00:22:02,965 --> 00:22:04,137
I DON'T WANT YOU TO BE RAISING

876
00:22:04,137 --> 00:22:05,275
MY BABY.

877
00:22:05,275 --> 00:22:05,965
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO IT

878
00:22:05,965 --> 00:22:06,620
ON MY OWN.

879
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:08,827
>> I DON'T WANT TO LET YOU GO.

880
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,241
LIKE, I REALLY DON'T.

881
00:22:11,241 --> 00:22:11,965
>> PUT IT SOMEWHERE.

882
00:22:11,965 --> 00:22:14,965
>> [crying]

883
00:22:14,965 --> 00:22:16,103
>> I BROUGHT YOUR GRADES.

884
00:22:16,103 --> 00:22:19,241
YOU HAVE TWO "F"s.

885
00:22:19,241 --> 00:22:20,137
>> PUSH IT DOWN.

886
00:22:20,137 --> 00:22:21,379
>> I AM.

887
00:22:21,379 --> 00:22:22,379
>> YOU'RE JUST [bleep] ANNOYING.

888
00:22:22,379 --> 00:22:23,413
>> YEAH, YOU'RE PRETTY ANNOYING,

889
00:22:23,413 --> 00:22:24,172
TOO.

890
00:22:24,172 --> 00:22:25,448
LIKE, YOU BLOW EVERYTHING OUT OF

891
00:22:25,448 --> 00:22:26,793
PROPORTION.

892
00:22:26,793 --> 00:22:28,413
WE NEVER REALLY, LIKE, GET ALONG

893
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:29,862
ANYMORE, REALLY.

894
00:22:29,862 --> 00:22:31,344
WE FIGHT ALL THE TIME.

895
00:22:31,344 --> 00:22:32,413
>> THE WHOLE SITUATION,

896
00:22:32,413 --> 00:22:33,862
THIS AIN'T ALL MY FAULT.

897
00:22:33,862 --> 00:22:35,172
I JUST DON'T SEE IT WORKING OUT,

898
00:22:35,172 --> 00:22:39,655
LIKE, AS PLANNED.

899
00:22:39,655 --> 00:22:41,620
>> WELL, YOU ARE ALREADY HAVING

900
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:43,413
A REACTION.

901
00:22:43,413 --> 00:22:46,379
A REACTION.
WHAT ARE YOU FEELING?

902
00:22:46,379 --> 00:22:49,655
WHAT ARE YOU FEELING?

903
00:22:49,655 --> 00:22:51,793
HARD TO WATCH?

904
00:22:51,793 --> 00:22:53,655
WHY?

905
00:22:53,655 --> 00:22:55,068
>> JUST CRAZY HOW MUCH HAS

906
00:22:55,068 --> 00:22:57,241
HAPPENED IN ONLY A YEAR.

907
00:22:57,241 --> 00:22:58,413
>> ALL THAT HAS HAPPENED TO YOU

908
00:22:58,413 --> 00:23:01,793
IN THE LAST YEAR, YEAH.

909
00:23:01,793 --> 00:23:02,965
CASEY, YOU'RE HAVING A REACTION

910
00:23:02,965 --> 00:23:03,655
TOO.

911
00:23:03,655 --> 00:23:04,482
>> MM-HMM.

912
00:23:04,482 --> 00:23:05,896
>> WHAT ARE YOU FEELING?

913
00:23:05,896 --> 00:23:07,310
>> JUST SAD.

914
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:10,068
>> WHAT'S SAD?

915
00:23:10,068 --> 00:23:11,620
>> JUST WATCHING HER GO THROUGH

916
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:13,068
WHAT I DID.

917
00:23:13,068 --> 00:23:14,793
>> SAME THING YOU WENT THROUGH

918
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:15,586
AS A TEEN MOM.

919
00:23:15,586 --> 00:23:16,862
>> YES.

920
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:18,206
>> IT'S A CYCLE, ISN'T IT?

921
00:23:18,206 --> 00:23:21,655
>> IT IS, AND I TRIED VERY HARD

922
00:23:21,655 --> 00:23:25,655
TO BREAK THAT CYCLE.

923
00:23:25,655 --> 00:23:30,931
AND I JUST FEEL LIKE I FAILED.

924
00:23:30,931 --> 00:23:31,896
>> HOW DID YOU TRY TO PREVENT

925
00:23:31,896 --> 00:23:35,137
THAT WITH YOUR DAUGHTER?

926
00:23:35,137 --> 00:23:37,310
>> WELL, WE TRIED BIRTH CONTROL.

927
00:23:37,310 --> 00:23:38,172
>> WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE BIRTH

928
00:23:38,172 --> 00:23:39,448
CONTROL?

929
00:23:39,448 --> 00:23:40,620
>> I QUIT TAKING IT.

930
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,551
>> WHY?

931
00:23:41,551 --> 00:23:44,103
>> UM, I NEVER REMEMBERED TO.

932
00:23:44,103 --> 00:23:44,931
>> AND THIS IS WHERE YOU BLAME

933
00:23:44,931 --> 00:23:45,758
YOURSELF?

934
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:47,655
>> MM-HMM.

935
00:23:47,655 --> 00:23:48,655
>> WHAT IS THE STATUS OF YOUR

936
00:23:48,655 --> 00:23:51,068
RELATIONSHIP NOW, BETWEEN YOU

937
00:23:51,068 --> 00:23:52,034
TWO?

938
00:23:52,034 --> 00:23:53,965
>> IT'S ROCKY, BUT WE'RE

939
00:23:53,965 --> 00:23:55,103
TOGETHER.

940
00:23:55,103 --> 00:23:56,724
>> TOGETHER, AS OF THE LAST FIVE

941
00:23:56,724 --> 00:23:58,137
MINUTES OR...

942
00:23:58,137 --> 00:23:59,620
>> YEAH, BASICALLY.

943
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:00,965
>> THE LAST FIVE MINUTES.

944
00:24:00,965 --> 00:24:02,000
HOW ABOUT TEN MINUTES BEFORE

945
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,275
THAT, WHERE WERE YOU?

946
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,655
>> UM, WELL, WE JUST HAD A

947
00:24:05,655 --> 00:24:07,034
REALLY BIG BREAKUP.

948
00:24:07,034 --> 00:24:07,862
>> WHEN?

949
00:24:07,862 --> 00:24:09,310
>> 2 1/2 WEEKS AGO.

950
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:11,034
>> IT WAS FINISHED?

951
00:24:11,034 --> 00:24:13,103
>> IT WASN'T FINISHED.

952
00:24:13,103 --> 00:24:14,379
WE WAS FED UP WITH EACH OTHER AT

953
00:24:14,379 --> 00:24:17,931
THE TIME, BUT I REALIZED, BEING

954
00:24:17,931 --> 00:24:19,344
GONE OUT OF THE HOUSE, AWAY FROM

955
00:24:19,344 --> 00:24:21,275
JAMIE AND AWAY FROM HER,

956
00:24:21,275 --> 00:24:26,000
THAT IT'S WAY EASIER TO JUST

957
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,275
STAY AND FACE THE PROBLEMS THAT

958
00:24:28,275 --> 00:24:31,172
HAVE--OR CAME TO US.

959
00:24:31,172 --> 00:24:32,310
>> I THINK IT'S EASIER TO RUN

960
00:24:32,310 --> 00:24:33,000
AWAY.

961
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:33,758
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

962
00:24:33,758 --> 00:24:34,862
>> NO, IT'S NOT EASIER TO RUN

963
00:24:34,862 --> 00:24:35,862
AWAY 'CAUSE IT DON'T SOLVE

964
00:24:35,862 --> 00:24:36,655
NOTHING.

965
00:24:36,655 --> 00:24:37,793
>> THAT'S FOR SURE.

966
00:24:37,793 --> 00:24:38,655
CASEY, WHAT DO YOU SEE GOING ON

967
00:24:38,655 --> 00:24:39,517
HERE?

968
00:24:39,517 --> 00:24:40,793
IS IT JUST THE STRESS OF BEING A

969
00:24:40,793 --> 00:24:41,620
PARENT AND BEING A TEEN MOM?

970
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:42,655
>> IT HONESTLY IS.

971
00:24:42,655 --> 00:24:43,931
IT REALLY IS.

972
00:24:43,931 --> 00:24:45,103
>> WE DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO

973
00:24:45,103 --> 00:24:46,103
WORRY ABOUT BEFORE.

974
00:24:46,103 --> 00:24:47,862
WE WERE, LIKE, TEENAGERS.

975
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:49,137
>> THIS SORT OF BROUGHT REALITY

976
00:24:49,137 --> 00:24:49,896
DOWN FOR YOU, HUH?

977
00:24:49,896 --> 00:24:51,137
>> MM-HMM.

978
00:24:51,137 --> 00:24:56,724
>> AND THAT'S WHAT UPSETS YOU.

979
00:24:56,724 --> 00:24:59,896
>> MY LIFE WAS WAY DIFFERENT.

980
00:24:59,896 --> 00:25:00,827
LIKE, I DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING TO

981
00:25:00,827 --> 00:25:03,689
WORRY ABOUT.

982
00:25:03,689 --> 00:25:05,344
>> CASEY, DID YOU HAVE A PERIOD

983
00:25:05,344 --> 00:25:07,551
OF TIME WHEN YOU WERE PARENTING

984
00:25:07,551 --> 00:25:08,896
WHEN YOU NEEDED TO BE HER BEST

985
00:25:08,896 --> 00:25:10,758
FRIEND?

986
00:25:10,758 --> 00:25:12,172
>> PROBABLY.

987
00:25:12,172 --> 00:25:12,965
>> HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT

988
00:25:12,965 --> 00:25:14,379
NOW?

989
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:16,275
>> I REGRET IT.

990
00:25:16,275 --> 00:25:17,827
I HONESTLY FEEL LIKE I'VE RAISED

991
00:25:17,827 --> 00:25:20,344
HER AS MY LITTLE SISTER.

992
00:25:20,344 --> 00:25:23,620
HER AS MY LITTLE SISTER.
I ALWAYS...

993
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:34,137
I ALWAYS...

994
00:25:34,137 --> 00:25:35,068
I'M SORRY.

995
00:25:35,068 --> 00:25:35,827
>> IT'S OKAY.

996
00:25:35,827 --> 00:25:37,965
THAT YOU ALWAYS WHAT?

997
00:25:37,965 --> 00:25:39,586
>> I JUST ALWAYS WANTED THE BEST

998
00:25:39,586 --> 00:25:40,413
FOR HER.

999
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,620
>> OF COURSE.

1000
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:43,000
DO YOU OWE HER A LITTLE BIT

1001
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,896
OF AN APOLOGY FOR DOING THAT?

1002
00:25:45,896 --> 00:25:46,896
>> I DO.

1003
00:25:46,896 --> 00:25:47,655
>> DO YOU WANT TO SAY THAT TO

1004
00:25:47,655 --> 00:25:50,965
HER?

1005
00:25:50,965 --> 00:25:54,103
HER?
>> I REALLY AM SORRY, BABY.

1006
00:25:54,103 --> 00:25:57,758
>> I REALLY AM SORRY, BABY.

1007
00:25:57,758 --> 00:25:59,172
I DIDN'T RAISE YOU THE WAY THAT

1008
00:25:59,172 --> 00:26:01,965
I SHOULD HAVE, BUT I DIDN'T KNOW

1009
00:26:01,965 --> 00:26:04,034
HOW.

1010
00:26:04,034 --> 00:26:04,896
>> HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT ALL OF

1011
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:06,103
THIS?

1012
00:26:06,103 --> 00:26:08,241
>> SHE IS PHENOMENAL FOR SURE.

1013
00:26:08,241 --> 00:26:09,448
>> YOU WANT TO TELL HER THAT?

1014
00:26:09,448 --> 00:26:11,275
>> YES, YOU ARE PHENOMENAL.

1015
00:26:11,275 --> 00:26:14,275
YOU TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING.

1016
00:26:14,275 --> 00:26:15,034
EVERYTHING THAT NEEDS TO BE

1017
00:26:15,034 --> 00:26:17,000
TOOK CARE OF, YOU GOT IT.

1018
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,517
THERE'S NO...

1019
00:26:18,517 --> 00:26:19,448
>> DO YOU FEEL THE SAME WAY,

1020
00:26:19,448 --> 00:26:20,344
DANIELLE?

1021
00:26:20,344 --> 00:26:21,000
>> OH, YEAH.

1022
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,000
>> YEAH. SO MOM'S STEPPING UP.

1023
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:22,931
>> OH, YEAH.

1024
00:26:22,931 --> 00:26:24,482
>> FEELING GUILTY AND REGRETFUL,

1025
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:25,137
UNDERSTOOD.

1026
00:26:25,137 --> 00:26:25,862
>> SHE HELPS ME A LOT.

1027
00:26:25,862 --> 00:26:27,172
>> LET'S MOVE FORWARD.

1028
00:26:27,172 --> 00:26:29,379
YOU WERE TRYING TO SURVIVE.

1029
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:30,344
>> YEAH.

1030
00:26:30,344 --> 00:26:32,137
>> SO MOVING FORWARD, WHAT ABOUT

1031
00:26:32,137 --> 00:26:33,103
SCHOOL?

1032
00:26:33,103 --> 00:26:34,862
>> I'VE BEEN BEGGING HER TO--

1033
00:26:34,862 --> 00:26:36,862
I WANT TO GET MY GED.

1034
00:26:36,862 --> 00:26:37,655
>> YOU'RE BEGGING YOUR MOM TO

1035
00:26:37,655 --> 00:26:38,551
GET THE GED.

1036
00:26:38,551 --> 00:26:39,344
>> I'VE TRIED TO TAKE YOU.

1037
00:26:39,344 --> 00:26:40,448
>> NO, TO TAKE ME.

1038
00:26:40,448 --> 00:26:42,034
LIKE, I WANTED TO GO TO COLLEGE.

1039
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:43,413
IT'S NOT LIKE I'M TRYING TO,

1040
00:26:43,413 --> 00:26:44,413
LIKE, BLOW COLLEGE OFF.

1041
00:26:44,413 --> 00:26:45,206
>> HOW OLD ARE YOU?

1042
00:26:45,206 --> 00:26:46,137
>> 17.

1043
00:26:46,137 --> 00:26:47,620
>> WHY DIDN'T YOU TAKE YOURSELF?

1044
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,034
>> I CAN'T DRIVE.

1045
00:26:50,034 --> 00:26:50,862
>> FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS,

1046
00:26:50,862 --> 00:26:52,551
GET YOUR DRIVER'S LICENSE,

1047
00:26:52,551 --> 00:26:54,241
AND THEN TAKE YOURSELF, MOM.

1048
00:26:54,241 --> 00:26:55,551
>> MM-HMM.

1049
00:26:55,551 --> 00:26:57,000
>> LET'S TALK ABOUT THE BABY FOR

1050
00:26:57,000 --> 00:26:57,793
A MINUTE.

1051
00:26:57,793 --> 00:26:59,517
HOW ARE THINGS WITH THE BABY?

1052
00:26:59,517 --> 00:27:00,172
>> I LOVE HIM.

1053
00:27:00,172 --> 00:27:00,931
>> YOU LOVE THE BABY.

1054
00:27:00,931 --> 00:27:01,586
>> YEAH.

1055
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:02,344
>> EVERYTHING GOING OKAY?

1056
00:27:02,344 --> 00:27:03,068
HE'S HEALTHY?

1057
00:27:03,068 --> 00:27:03,758
>> YEAH.

1058
00:27:03,758 --> 00:27:04,413
OH, YEAH.

1059
00:27:04,413 --> 00:27:05,172
>> HE'S FAT.

1060
00:27:05,172 --> 00:27:06,965
HE'S A GIANT CHUNK OF BUTT.

1061
00:27:06,965 --> 00:27:07,827
>> ALL RIGHT, WELL, EVERYONE

1062
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:09,034
WATCHING RIGHT NOW NEEDS TO

1063
00:27:09,034 --> 00:27:10,413
UNDERSTAND, OF COURSE, THE

1064
00:27:10,413 --> 00:27:11,793
IMPORTANCE OF PREVENTION.

1065
00:27:11,793 --> 00:27:13,758
TO LEARN THE FACTS, MAKE SURE TO

1066
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:17,000
HEAD ON OVER TO:

1067
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,482
I WANT TO THANK DANIELLE,

1068
00:27:18,482 --> 00:27:19,896
JAMIE, CASEY.

1069
00:27:19,896 --> 00:27:21,172
VERY COURAGEOUS AND FOR ALL OF

LET'S MOVE RIGHT ON TO OUR NEXT

TEEN MOM, TAYLOR.

00:27:24,896 --> 00:27:27,068
TEEN MOM, TAYLOR.
HERE IS HER STORY.

1074
00:27:27,068 --> 00:27:30,000
HERE IS HER STORY.

1075
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,862
>> THESE PANTS, LOOK AT 'EM.

1076
00:27:31,862 --> 00:27:32,724
I COULD PUT ANOTHER PERSON IN

1077
00:27:32,724 --> 00:27:34,000
THERE.

1078
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,034
WHAT DID WE DO WHEN WE FIRST

1079
00:27:35,034 --> 00:27:36,068
STARTED DATING?

1080
00:27:36,068 --> 00:27:36,827
>> WENT OUT DANCING OR

1081
00:27:36,827 --> 00:27:37,724
SOMETHING?

1082
00:27:37,724 --> 00:27:38,724
AND LOOK WHAT ALL THAT GOT US

1083
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:39,655
INTO.

1084
00:27:39,655 --> 00:27:41,206
>> I WOULD LIKE TO SEE YOU GIVE

1085
00:27:41,206 --> 00:27:43,000
THE CHILD UP FOR ADOPTION.

1086
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,655
>> I JUST DON'T LIKE THE IDEA

1087
00:27:44,655 --> 00:27:45,689
OF ADOPTION.

1088
00:27:45,689 --> 00:27:46,482
>> I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE TO

1089
00:27:46,482 --> 00:27:47,310
STRUGGLE.

1090
00:27:47,310 --> 00:27:48,206
I KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE HARD FOR

1091
00:27:48,206 --> 00:27:49,310
YOU.

1092
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:50,206
>> IF I CAN'T STAY IN SCHOOL

1093
00:27:50,206 --> 00:27:51,448
I GUESS I'M GONNA HAVE TO

1094
00:27:51,448 --> 00:27:52,103
DO VIRTUAL SCHOOL, BUT

1095
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:54,206
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO.

1096
00:27:54,206 --> 00:27:55,310
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT NATHAN TO

1097
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:56,724
HAVE AS A DAD?

1098
00:27:56,724 --> 00:27:57,931
>> A JOB.

1099
00:27:57,931 --> 00:27:59,896
>> I'M GETTING A JOB SOON.

1100
00:27:59,896 --> 00:28:00,793
>> WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A BABY

1101
00:28:00,793 --> 00:28:02,620
IN LESS THAN 24 HOURS.

1102
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:03,551
>> YOU GOT IT, HONEY.

1103
00:28:03,551 --> 00:28:04,724
YOU GOT IT.

1104
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:08,310
GREAT.

1105
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,758
>> I TOLD YOU, ONCE YOU HAVE A

1106
00:28:09,758 --> 00:28:10,655
BABY, YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO HAVE

1107
00:28:10,655 --> 00:28:12,068
ANY SLEEP AGAIN.

1108
00:28:12,068 --> 00:28:13,103
>> I AT LEAST NEED AN HOUR OF

1109
00:28:13,103 --> 00:28:16,241
SLEEP TO FUNCTION RIGHT.

1110
00:28:16,241 --> 00:28:17,586
>> SOMEBODY NEEDS TO GET A JOB.

1111
00:28:17,586 --> 00:28:18,241
>> I'M TRYING.

1112
00:28:18,241 --> 00:28:18,931
I'VE BEEN FILLING OUT

1113
00:28:18,931 --> 00:28:19,586
APPLICATIONS.

1114
00:28:19,586 --> 00:28:20,275
>> LET'S TRY HARDER.

1115
00:28:20,275 --> 00:28:21,724
>> GO GET THE FRICKIN' BOTTLE.

1116
00:28:21,724 --> 00:28:22,689
>> I'M NOT DOING IT, 'CAUSE

1117
00:28:22,689 --> 00:28:23,344
IT'S NOT MY TURN.

1118
00:28:23,344 --> 00:28:25,000
>> 'CAUSE YOU'RE LAZY.

1119
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:25,724
>> OH, MY GOD.

1120
00:28:25,724 --> 00:28:26,724
YOU'RE SO FRIGGIN'...

1121
00:28:26,724 --> 00:28:27,551
>> IT'S NOT HARD FOR YOU TO GET

1122
00:28:27,551 --> 00:28:28,172
SOMETHING.

1123
00:28:28,172 --> 00:28:29,931
>> IRRITATING.

1124
00:28:29,931 --> 00:28:31,379
>> THIS SITUATION IS OUT OF

1125
00:28:31,379 --> 00:28:32,551
CONTROL.

1126
00:28:32,551 --> 00:28:34,724
KIDS SHOULD NOT HAVE KIDS

1127
00:28:34,724 --> 00:28:36,000
'CAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW HOW TO

1128
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,517
HANDLE SITUATIONS YET.

1129
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:39,931
>> I THINK THE ONLY REASON WE

1130
00:28:39,931 --> 00:28:41,862
STAY TOGETHER IS A LITTLE BIT OF

1131
00:28:41,862 --> 00:28:46,758
LOVE AND BECAUSE OF HER.

1132
00:28:46,758 --> 00:28:47,931
>> I'M HERE NOW WITH TAYLOR AND

1133
00:28:47,931 --> 00:28:49,896
AUBRI'S FATHER, NATHAN.

1134
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:50,965
NOW, GUYS, THINGS WERE SHAKY AT

1135
00:28:50,965 --> 00:28:52,655
BEST BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU WHEN

1136
00:28:52,655 --> 00:28:53,448
WE LEFT OFF.

1137
00:28:53,448 --> 00:28:54,724
WHAT'S THE STATUS NOW?

1138
00:28:54,724 --> 00:28:57,275
>> WE'RE STILL TOGETHER AND

1139
00:28:57,275 --> 00:28:58,793
DOING A LITTLE BETTER.

1140
00:28:58,793 --> 00:28:59,586
>> TAYLOR, HOW DID YOU FEEL

1141
00:28:59,586 --> 00:29:01,517
WATCHING THAT EPISODE JUST NOW?

1142
00:29:01,517 --> 00:29:03,689
>> IT'S KIND OF UPSETTING.

1143
00:29:03,689 --> 00:29:05,000
>> IN WHAT WAY?

1144
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,137
>> LIKE, I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW

1145
00:29:06,137 --> 00:29:09,034
MUCH WE DID FIGHT, AND IT WAS

1146
00:29:09,034 --> 00:29:12,137
JUST OVER LITTLE THINGS.

1147
00:29:12,137 --> 00:29:12,862
>> WHY DO YOU PICK ON HIM SO

1148
00:29:12,862 --> 00:29:13,655
MUCH?

1149
00:29:13,655 --> 00:29:14,689
>> HE JUST WANTS TO PLAY WITH

1150
00:29:14,689 --> 00:29:16,310
HER WHEN IT'S CONVENIENT FOR HIM

1151
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:17,655
SOMETIMES, AND THAT'S JUST WHAT

1152
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:18,758
MAKES ME MAD.

1153
00:29:18,758 --> 00:29:19,793
>> THIS IS THE THING OF TEEN

1154
00:29:19,793 --> 00:29:20,448
PREGNANCY.

1155
00:29:20,448 --> 00:29:23,103
YOU CAN'T BE WHAT YOUR

1156
00:29:23,103 --> 00:29:24,689
CHRONOLOGICAL AGE TELLS YOU

1157
00:29:24,689 --> 00:29:25,448
TO BE.

1158
00:29:25,448 --> 00:29:27,034
YOU'VE GOT TO GROW UP REALLY

1159
00:29:27,034 --> 00:29:27,724
FAST.

1160
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:28,551
TAYLOR, THIS HAS MADE YOU GROW

1161
00:29:28,551 --> 00:29:29,310
UP, HAS IT NOT?

1162
00:29:29,310 --> 00:29:30,931
>> YEAH, DEFINITELY.

1163
00:29:30,931 --> 00:29:31,827
>> NATHAN, YOU HAD A LOOK OF

1164
00:29:31,827 --> 00:29:32,862
SHOCK DURING THE DELIVERY.

1165
00:29:32,862 --> 00:29:33,620
WHAT WAS GOING THROUGH YOUR

1166
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:36,034
MIND?

1167
00:29:36,034 --> 00:29:39,137
>> FIRST OFF, THE SMELL,

1168
00:29:39,137 --> 00:29:40,551
AND THEN JUST...

1169
00:29:40,551 --> 00:29:41,965
>> WELL, LET ME SAY, PLACENTA

1170
00:29:41,965 --> 00:29:43,551
HAS A UNIQUE SMELL.

1171
00:29:43,551 --> 00:29:44,965
>> AND THEN JUST, LIKE, THAT WAS

1172
00:29:44,965 --> 00:29:46,413
LIKE WHEN THE HEAD FIRST STARTED

1173
00:29:46,413 --> 00:29:47,793
COMING OUT AND JUST LIKE:

1174
00:29:47,793 --> 00:29:49,275
LIKE, "WHOA."

1175
00:29:49,275 --> 00:29:50,965
LIKE, "SHE'S COMING."

1176
00:29:50,965 --> 00:29:51,827
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING FOR BIRTH

1177
00:29:51,827 --> 00:29:53,034
CONTROL NOW?

1178
00:29:53,034 --> 00:29:54,068
>> I'M ON THE PILL.

1179
00:29:54,068 --> 00:29:55,310
>> OKAY. TAKING IT PROPERLY?

1180
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:56,310
>> YES.

1181
00:29:56,310 --> 00:29:58,724
>> WHAT WENT WRONG BEFORE?

1182
00:29:58,724 --> 00:30:00,413
>> CONDOM BROKE.

1183
00:30:00,413 --> 00:30:01,379
>> CONDOM BROKE?

1184
00:30:01,379 --> 00:30:02,275
MORNING AFTER PILL,

1185
00:30:02,275 --> 00:30:03,448
YOU GUYS EVER HEARD OF THAT?

1186
00:30:03,448 --> 00:30:04,965
EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION.

1187
00:30:04,965 --> 00:30:06,068
>> I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL MY MOM.

1188
00:30:06,068 --> 00:30:07,379
I WAS LIKE, "EW. HOW AWKWARD."

1189
00:30:07,379 --> 00:30:08,275
>> YOUR MOM SEEMS LIKE SOMEBODY

1190
00:30:08,275 --> 00:30:09,241
THAT TALKS VERY OPENLY WITH YOU

1191
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:10,034
ABOUT THIS STUFF.

1192
00:30:10,034 --> 00:30:11,482
NO?

1193
00:30:11,482 --> 00:30:12,827
WELL, LET'S TALK ABOUT, FOR

1194
00:30:12,827 --> 00:30:13,620
OTHER PEOPLE OUT THERE, WHAT

1195
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:14,931
EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION IS.

1196
00:30:14,931 --> 00:30:16,965
IF THERE IS A FAILURE OF

1197
00:30:16,965 --> 00:30:19,000
A BARRIER METHOD LIKE A CONDOM,

1198
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,482
YOU CAN GO TO A PHARMACY AND GET

1199
00:30:21,482 --> 00:30:23,758
SOME PILLS YOU TAKE WITHIN THREE

1200
00:30:23,758 --> 00:30:25,517
DAYS OF THAT ENCOUNTER AND

1201
00:30:25,517 --> 00:30:27,689
REDUCE THE RISKS OF PREGNANCY

1202
00:30:27,689 --> 00:30:29,275
MARKEDLY.

1203
00:30:29,275 --> 00:30:30,793
JUST BEFORE WE WENT ON THE AIR,

1204
00:30:30,793 --> 00:30:31,793
YOU MENTIONED TO ME DURING THE

1205
00:30:31,793 --> 00:30:33,724
BREAK THAT AUBRI HAD HAD A LUNG

1206
00:30:33,724 --> 00:30:35,310
SURGERY, HAD A TUMOR REMOVED

1207
00:30:35,310 --> 00:30:36,000
FROM HER LUNG.

1208
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:36,862
>> YEAH.

1209
00:30:36,862 --> 00:30:37,827
>> HOW'S THAT GOING NOW?

1210
00:30:37,827 --> 00:30:38,482
HOW'S SHE DOING?

1211
00:30:38,482 --> 00:30:39,689
>> SHE'S WONDERFUL NOW.

1212
00:30:39,689 --> 00:30:41,827
IT WAS JUST SO SAD TO SEE HER GO

1213
00:30:41,827 --> 00:30:42,827
THROUGH THAT.

1214
00:30:42,827 --> 00:30:46,965
IT WAS SO HARD.

1215
00:30:46,965 --> 00:30:49,862
>> IT'S EXTRA INTENSE, HUH?

1216
00:30:49,862 --> 00:30:52,586
YEAH.

1217
00:30:52,586 --> 00:30:53,586
WHAT THEY TOOK OUT WAS THE

1218
00:30:53,586 --> 00:30:54,862
CCAM, RIGHT?

1219
00:30:54,862 --> 00:30:56,482
>> YEAH, AND 20% OF HER LUNG.

1220
00:30:56,482 --> 00:30:57,517
>> RIGHT.

1221
00:30:57,517 --> 00:30:58,344
SO THEN THAT'S ALL NOW A

1222
00:30:58,344 --> 00:30:59,517
COMPLETE.

1223
00:30:59,517 --> 00:31:00,517
ARE YOU OKAY?

1224
00:31:00,517 --> 00:31:02,551
>> YEAH, IT'S JUST HARD.

1225
00:31:02,551 --> 00:31:03,931
YOU DON'T--SHE DIDN'T DO

1226
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:04,620
ANYTHING.

1227
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:08,103
SHE'S SO LITTLE.

1228
00:31:08,103 --> 00:31:10,137
>> IT'S HARD.

1229
00:31:10,137 --> 00:31:11,620
NOW, MY UNDERSTANDING IS, YOUR

1230
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,103
MOM HAD PUT A CHILD UP

1231
00:31:13,103 --> 00:31:14,724
FOR ADOPTION AND THAT SHE WAS

1232
00:31:14,724 --> 00:31:16,206
ENCOURAGING YOU TO DO THE SAME.

1233
00:31:16,206 --> 00:31:17,103
>> YEAH.

1234
00:31:17,103 --> 00:31:17,965
>> ALL RIGHT.

1235
00:31:17,965 --> 00:31:18,965
TAYLOR'S MOM, DEBI, IS HERE

1236
00:31:18,965 --> 00:31:19,620
WITH US.

1237
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:21,137
DEBI, COME ON OUT.

1238
00:31:21,137 --> 00:31:24,620
[applause]

1239
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:27,482
HAVE A SEAT. WELCOME.

1240
00:31:27,482 --> 00:31:28,758
SO YOU WERE IN FAVOR OF

1241
00:31:28,758 --> 00:31:30,000
ADOPTION, MOM?

1242
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:30,655
>> YES.

1243
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:31,413
>> AND DID TAYLOR MAKE A GOOD

1244
00:31:31,413 --> 00:31:33,172
DECISION NOT TO DO THAT?

1245
00:31:33,172 --> 00:31:35,310
>> NOW, YES.

1246
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:36,689
I CAN'T SEE LIFE WITHOUT AUBRI.

1247
00:31:36,689 --> 00:31:38,137
SHE'S BEAUTIFUL.

1248
00:31:38,137 --> 00:31:39,103
>> YEAH.

1249
00:31:39,103 --> 00:31:40,137
>> SHE'S A GOOD BABY.

1250
00:31:40,137 --> 00:31:41,000
>> AND, DEBI, YOU'RE PICKING UP

1251
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,413
A LOT OF THE PARENTING.

1252
00:31:42,413 --> 00:31:43,689
LET'S BE FAIR.

1253
00:31:43,689 --> 00:31:44,620
LIKE, WHAT WOULD THEY DO WITHOUT

1254
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:45,344
YOU?

1255
00:31:45,344 --> 00:31:46,931
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1256
00:31:46,931 --> 00:31:47,758
>> THIS IS A COMMON THEME IN OUR

1257
00:31:47,758 --> 00:31:49,793
COUNTRY--THE GRANDPARENTS DOING

1258
00:31:49,793 --> 00:31:51,103
A LOT OF THE PARENTING.

1259
00:31:51,103 --> 00:31:52,034
>> AND IT'S VERY HARD ON ME.

1260
00:31:52,034 --> 00:31:53,241
IT REALLY IS.

1261
00:31:53,241 --> 00:31:54,206
>> YOU WORK?

1262
00:31:54,206 --> 00:31:55,448
>> I WORK THIRD SHIFT, SO I COME

1263
00:31:55,448 --> 00:31:57,068
HOME AND THEN I WATCH HER,

1264
00:31:57,068 --> 00:31:58,172
YOU KNOW, AND THEN I HAVE TO

1265
00:31:58,172 --> 00:31:59,172
STAY UP ALL DAY.

1266
00:31:59,172 --> 00:32:01,793
I MIGHT TWO OR THREE HOURS'

1267
00:32:01,793 --> 00:32:02,931
SLEEP A DAY, AND THAT'S PRETTY

1268
00:32:02,931 --> 00:32:03,965
MUCH IT.

1269
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:04,931
>> YOU SORT OF SHIFTED WHEN SHE

1270
00:32:04,931 --> 00:32:05,655
SAID THAT.

1271
00:32:05,655 --> 00:32:06,896
DO YOU FEEL GUILTY?

1272
00:32:06,896 --> 00:32:10,000
>> YEAH, 'CAUSE, LIKE, I TRIED

1273
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:11,413
HOMESCHOOLING, BUT I COULDN'T

1274
00:32:11,413 --> 00:32:12,586
DO IT.

1275
00:32:12,586 --> 00:32:14,172
I NEED SOMEONE TO TELL ME, LIKE,

1276
00:32:14,172 --> 00:32:15,689
"YOU NEED TO DO THIS, THIS,

1277
00:32:15,689 --> 00:32:16,379
AND THIS."

1278
00:32:16,379 --> 00:32:17,206
>> WHOSE IDEA WAS IT TO GO BACK

1279
00:32:17,206 --> 00:32:18,586
TO SCHOOL?

1280
00:32:18,586 --> 00:32:19,310
>> IT WAS MINE.

1281
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:20,068
I WAS LIKE, "I CANNOT SIT IN

1282
00:32:20,068 --> 00:32:20,862
THIS HOUSE ANY LONGER.

1283
00:32:20,862 --> 00:32:22,103
I CAN'T DO HOMESCHOOLING."

1284
00:32:22,103 --> 00:32:23,275
>> DEBI, YOU SUPPORTED THAT?

1285
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:23,965
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1286
00:32:23,965 --> 00:32:25,172
SHE NEEDED TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

1287
00:32:25,172 --> 00:32:25,862
>> SO LET'S BE CLEAR.

1288
00:32:25,862 --> 00:32:26,931
I MEAN, YES, DEBI'S STRESSED

1289
00:32:26,931 --> 00:32:28,620
AND DEBI'S WORKING HARD,

1290
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:29,448
BUT SHE WANTS YOU TO GO BACK TO

1291
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:30,103
SCHOOL.

1292
00:32:30,103 --> 00:32:30,793
>> YEAH.

1293
00:32:30,793 --> 00:32:31,620
>> IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE BEING

1294
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:32,620
SELFISH BY GOING BACK TO SCHOOL.

1295
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:33,517
>> NO.

1296
00:32:33,517 --> 00:32:34,379
>> OKAY.

1297
00:32:34,379 --> 00:32:35,724
DEBI, YOU'VE BEEN VERY, UM,

1298
00:32:35,724 --> 00:32:37,689
VOCAL ABOUT YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT

1299
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:38,655
TEEN PREGNANCY.

1300
00:32:38,655 --> 00:32:39,758
ANYTHING YOU'D LIKE TO SAY TO

1301
00:32:39,758 --> 00:32:41,103
PEOPLE WATCHING OUT THERE?

1302
00:32:41,103 --> 00:32:44,034
>> USE CONDOMS. USE PROTECTION.

1303
00:32:44,034 --> 00:32:45,000
THEY JUST REALLY NEED TO KNOW

1304
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,310
THAT IT IS VERY HARD.

1305
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:48,310
IT IS VERY HARD, AND YOU ARE

1306
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:50,344
DEALING WITH A HUMAN LIFE

1307
00:32:50,344 --> 00:32:52,724
THAT YOU HAVE TO SACRIFICE AND

1308
00:32:52,724 --> 00:32:53,758
TAKE CARE.

1309
00:32:53,758 --> 00:32:56,103
YOU KNOW, AND IF YOU KNOW THAT

1310
00:32:56,103 --> 00:32:57,413
YOUR FREEDOM'S GONE, YOUR TIME

1311
00:32:57,413 --> 00:32:59,000
IS GONE, YOUR SLEEP IS GONE.

1312
00:32:59,000 --> 00:32:59,793
>> YOUR CHILDHOOD'S GONE.

1313
00:32:59,793 --> 00:33:01,000
>> YOUR CHILDHOOD'S GONE.

1314
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,551
YOU KNOW, IT...

1315
00:33:03,551 --> 00:33:04,379
>> TRUE?

1316
00:33:04,379 --> 00:33:05,655
>> IF YOU VALUE GOING OUT,

1317
00:33:05,655 --> 00:33:07,206
STAYING OUT LATE, VALUE YOUR

1318
00:33:07,206 --> 00:33:08,689
SLEEP, AND BEING CAREFREE

1319
00:33:08,689 --> 00:33:11,172
AND NOT HAVING TO DO ANYTHING,

1320
00:33:11,172 --> 00:33:13,068
WEAR PROTECTION, BIRTH CONTROL,

1321
00:33:13,068 --> 00:33:13,827
SOMETHING.

1322
00:33:13,827 --> 00:33:14,620
>> NO MATTER WHAT.

1323
00:33:14,620 --> 00:33:15,896
>> NO MATTER WHAT.

1324
00:33:15,896 --> 00:33:17,758
IF YOU HAVE TO ASK SOME BUM OFF

1325
00:33:17,758 --> 00:33:18,965
THE STREET FOR A CONDOM,

1326
00:33:18,965 --> 00:33:19,793
ASK THE BUM OFF THE STREET

1327
00:33:19,793 --> 00:33:21,103
FOR A CONDOM.

1328
00:33:21,103 --> 00:33:22,413
LIKE...

1329
00:33:22,413 --> 00:33:23,379
>> WELL, THANK ALL OF YOU FOR

1330
00:33:23,379 --> 00:33:24,931
BEING HERE, AND MORE WITH TAYLOR

1331
00:33:24,931 --> 00:33:25,724
AT THE END OF THE SHOW, OF

1332
00:33:25,724 --> 00:33:26,448
COURSE.

1333
00:33:26,448 --> 00:33:27,172
BUT FOR NOW IT'S TIME FOR A

1334
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:28,068
LITTLE BREAK, AND WE WILL COME

1335
00:33:28,068 --> 00:33:29,655
BACK WITH JAMIE, WHOSE STORY GOT

1336
00:33:29,655 --> 00:33:31,068
MORE INTENSE AND COMPLICATED

1337
00:33:31,068 --> 00:33:32,551
ONCE THE CAMERAS STOPPED

1338
00:33:32,551 --> 00:33:33,965
ROLLING.

1339
00:33:33,965 --> 00:33:36,586
ROLLING.
[applause]

1340
00:33:36,586 --> 00:33:44,482
[applause]

1341
00:33:44,482 --> 00:33:46,689
[applause]

1342
00:33:46,689 --> 00:33:47,655
>> WELCOME BACK TO LIFE AFTER

1343
00:33:47,655 --> 00:33:48,310
 LABOR.

1344
00:33:48,310 --> 00:33:49,758
I'M DR. DREW.

1345
00:33:49,758 --> 00:33:51,689
ONE IN SIX AMERICAN TEENS WILL

1346
00:33:51,689 --> 00:33:53,551
HAVE A BABY BEFORE TURNING 20.

1347
00:33:53,551 --> 00:33:54,827
THAT'S ONE IN SIX.

1348
00:33:54,827 --> 00:33:56,172
JAMIE'S HERE WITH US.

1349
00:33:56,172 --> 00:33:57,137
JAMIE, DID YOU EVER THINK YOU'D

1350
00:33:57,137 --> 00:33:58,068
BE ONE OF THOSE GIRLS?

1351
00:33:58,068 --> 00:33:59,068
>> NO.

1352
00:33:59,068 --> 00:34:01,310
I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD HAPPEN

1353
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:02,724
TO ME.

1354
00:34:02,724 --> 00:34:03,931
>> OKAY, WELL, WE'LL TALK MORE

1355
00:34:03,931 --> 00:34:05,103
WITH JAMIE AND BRING OUT HER MOM

1356
00:34:05,103 --> 00:34:06,379
AND THE BABY'S FATHER AFTER THE

1357
00:34:06,379 --> 00:34:07,517
RECAP OF HER STORY.

1358
00:34:07,517 --> 00:34:12,241
TAKE A LOOK.

1359
00:34:12,241 --> 00:34:14,034
>> JAMIE IS PREGNANT?

1360
00:34:14,034 --> 00:34:15,862
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO REACT.

1361
00:34:15,862 --> 00:34:18,172
>> DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE.

1362
00:34:18,172 --> 00:34:19,931
>> SO, LIKE, RYAN, YOU THINK

1363
00:34:19,931 --> 00:34:21,482
HE'S GOING TO STEP UP?

1364
00:34:21,482 --> 00:34:23,034
>> HE DOESN'T FULLY

1365
00:34:23,034 --> 00:34:24,275
UNDERSTAND IT.

1366
00:34:24,275 --> 00:34:26,413
CAN YOU HANDLE IT, RYAN?

1367
00:34:26,413 --> 00:34:27,275
>> YOU NEVER CAN BE PREPARED FOR

1368
00:34:27,275 --> 00:34:29,344
IT, YOU KNOW?

1369
00:34:29,344 --> 00:34:30,689
>> HE'S A 17-YEAR-OLD KID TRYING

1370
00:34:30,689 --> 00:34:31,620
TO BE A GROWN-UP.

1371
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:32,620
YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE

1372
00:34:32,620 --> 00:34:33,620
MIAH?

1373
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:34,482
>> I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO TAKE

1374
00:34:34,482 --> 00:34:35,517
MIAH.

1375
00:34:35,517 --> 00:34:36,344
>> I GUESS WE'LL JUST HAVE TO

1376
00:34:36,344 --> 00:34:37,482
SEE HOW IT GOES.

1377
00:34:37,482 --> 00:34:41,137
>> SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT.

1378
00:34:41,137 --> 00:34:42,206
DEEP BREATH, AND PUSH ANOTHER

1379
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:43,482
TIME FOR HER BODY.

1380
00:34:43,482 --> 00:34:44,965
AND LOOK AT MAMA.

1381
00:34:44,965 --> 00:34:48,206
>> OH, LOOK.

1382
00:34:48,206 --> 00:34:49,034
YOU'RE NOT EVEN OLD ENOUGH TO

1383
00:34:49,034 --> 00:34:50,137
DRINK, AND YOU SHOW UP

1384
00:34:50,137 --> 00:34:53,379
HUNG OVER.

1385
00:34:53,379 --> 00:34:55,034
>> WHICH MAJOR POPULATION SHIFT

1386
00:34:55,034 --> 00:34:55,793
OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF

1387
00:34:55,793 --> 00:34:57,034
INDUSTRIALIZATION?

1388
00:34:57,034 --> 00:34:58,275
>> I HAVEN'T READ FAR ENOUGH TO

1389
00:34:58,275 --> 00:34:59,241
THIS ONE.

1390
00:34:59,241 --> 00:35:00,241
>> WHO CHEATS ON THEIR PREGNANT

1391
00:35:00,241 --> 00:35:01,655
GIRLFRIEND?

1392
00:35:01,655 --> 00:35:02,655
>> A DOUCHE BAG.

1393
00:35:02,655 --> 00:35:04,103
RYAN.

1394
00:35:04,103 --> 00:35:05,413
>> IT WOULD TOTALLY BE A LOT

1395
00:35:05,413 --> 00:35:06,793
DIFFERENT, JAMIE, IF HE HADN'T

1396
00:35:06,793 --> 00:35:07,931
SPUN ME ALL THAT [bleep] THAT HE

1397
00:35:07,931 --> 00:35:10,137
LOVED YOU AND LOVED MIAH.

1398
00:35:10,137 --> 00:35:11,137
HE WAS GOING TO BE THERE.

1399
00:35:11,137 --> 00:35:12,206
AND ALL ALONG BEHIND THE SCENES,

1400
00:35:12,206 --> 00:35:13,931
HE'S BEEN DOING GOD ONLY KNOWS

1401
00:35:13,931 --> 00:35:14,620
WHAT.

1402
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:16,344
>> YOU CHEATED ON ME.

1403
00:35:16,344 --> 00:35:18,068
>> I CHEATED ON YOU?

1404
00:35:18,068 --> 00:35:18,896
>> I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO JUST

1405
00:35:18,896 --> 00:35:19,827
DENY IT.

1406
00:35:19,827 --> 00:35:21,068
I KNOW.

1407
00:35:21,068 --> 00:35:22,000
YOU AND I AREN'T GOING TO WORK

1408
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,310
ANYTHING OUT.

1409
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,551
WE HAVE TO GO TO COURT,

1410
00:35:24,551 --> 00:35:27,586
WE HAVE TO GO TO COURT,
AND THAT'S THAT.

1411
00:35:27,586 --> 00:35:30,172
AND THAT'S THAT.

1412
00:35:30,172 --> 00:35:31,034
>> WELL, YOU'RE HAVING SOME

1413
00:35:31,034 --> 00:35:32,137
FEELINGS.

1414
00:35:32,137 --> 00:35:35,586
>> WELL, YEAH.

1415
00:35:35,586 --> 00:35:36,310
>> DID SOMETHING SPECIFIC

1416
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:38,413
TRIGGER YOU?

1417
00:35:38,413 --> 00:35:39,620
JUST HOW INTENSE THIS LAST

1418
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:42,000
YEAR'S BEEN.

1419
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:43,482
NOW, WHEN WE LEFT OFF, YOU AND

1420
00:35:43,482 --> 00:35:44,344
RYAN WERE GOING TO COURT TO

1421
00:35:44,344 --> 00:35:45,689
FIGURE OUT HOW OFTEN HE COULD

1422
00:35:45,689 --> 00:35:46,724
SEE MIAH.

1423
00:35:46,724 --> 00:35:48,103
WHERE DO WE STAND NOW?

1424
00:35:48,103 --> 00:35:49,310
>> HE SEES HER EVERY WEDNESDAY

1425
00:35:49,310 --> 00:35:51,275
AT THE VISITATION CENTER.

1426
00:35:51,275 --> 00:35:52,448
IT'S SUPERVISED, AND HE SEES HER

1427
00:35:52,448 --> 00:35:53,344
FOR AN HOUR.

1428
00:35:53,344 --> 00:35:54,448
>> DOES HE COME EVERY TIME?

1429
00:35:54,448 --> 00:35:56,793
>> HE'S ONLY MISSED ONE DAY.

1430
00:35:56,793 --> 00:35:57,793
>> SO HE'S BEEN SHOWING UP.

1431
00:35:57,793 --> 00:35:58,482
>> YES.

1432
00:35:58,482 --> 00:35:59,137
>> THAT'S PRETTY GOOD.

1433
00:35:59,137 --> 00:35:59,827
>> YEAH.

1434
00:35:59,827 --> 00:36:01,000
>> WHERE ARE YOU AND HE AT?

1435
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,655
>> WE DO NOT SPEAK AT ALL.

1436
00:36:02,655 --> 00:36:03,724
I CHANGED MY NUMBER SO HE COULD

1437
00:36:03,724 --> 00:36:05,000
NOT CONTACT ME AT ALL.

1438
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:05,965
>> IS THAT HARD?

1439
00:36:05,965 --> 00:36:07,655
>> YEAH.

1440
00:36:07,655 --> 00:36:08,689
I'VE BEEN WITH HIM FOR TWO

1441
00:36:08,689 --> 00:36:10,000
YEARS.

1442
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,103
>> WELL, YOUR FRIENDS SAW HIM

1443
00:36:11,103 --> 00:36:13,000
THE WAY YOU SEE HIM NOW.

1444
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:14,034
>> MM-HMM.

1445
00:36:14,034 --> 00:36:16,344
>> HOW COME YOU DIDN'T SEE IT?

1446
00:36:16,344 --> 00:36:18,413
>> LOVE IS BLIND.

1447
00:36:18,413 --> 00:36:19,206
>> TALK TO ME ABOUT RYAN'S

1448
00:36:19,206 --> 00:36:19,896
CHEATING.

1449
00:36:19,896 --> 00:36:21,275
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?

1450
00:36:21,275 --> 00:36:22,137
>> I CANNOT BELIEVE I DID NOT

1451
00:36:22,137 --> 00:36:23,620
SEE IT, BECAUSE I WAS LIKE,

1452
00:36:23,620 --> 00:36:25,310
WHEN I WAS PREGNANT, I WAS LIKE,

1453
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,413
"NO. I HAVE A GOOD MAN.

1454
00:36:27,413 --> 00:36:28,344
HE'S NOT GOING TO DO THAT TO ME.

1455
00:36:28,344 --> 00:36:30,137
HE LOVES ME."

1456
00:36:30,137 --> 00:36:31,034
>> YOU ASKED THE QUESTION IN

1457
00:36:31,034 --> 00:36:32,965
YOUR EPISODE "WHO CHEATS ON

1458
00:36:32,965 --> 00:36:33,862
THEIR PREGNANT GIRLFRIEND?"

1459
00:36:33,862 --> 00:36:35,241
>> MM-HMM.

1460
00:36:35,241 --> 00:36:37,068
AND CYBIL SAYS "A DOUCHE BAG,"

1461
00:36:37,068 --> 00:36:39,793
SO I GUESS THAT'S WHAT HE IS.

1462
00:36:39,793 --> 00:36:40,862
>> OKAY.

1463
00:36:40,862 --> 00:36:41,689
WELL, WE'LL LET PEOPLE AT HOME

1464
00:36:41,689 --> 00:36:42,724
JUDGE FOR THEMSELVES.

1465
00:36:42,724 --> 00:36:44,000
LET'S BRING OUT RYAN AND JAMIE'S

1466
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,689
MOM, APRIL.

1467
00:36:45,689 --> 00:36:51,482
[applause]

1468
00:36:51,482 --> 00:36:53,241
HAVE A SEAT, GUYS.

1469
00:36:53,241 --> 00:36:55,482
SO, RYAN, DID YOU HEAR WHAT WE

1470
00:36:55,482 --> 00:36:56,379
WERE TALKING ABOUT?

1471
00:36:56,379 --> 00:36:58,137
>> UH, A LITTLE BIT.

1472
00:36:58,137 --> 00:36:59,000
>> DEFEND YOURSELF TO PEOPLE

1473
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,241
AT HOME.

1474
00:37:00,241 --> 00:37:02,379
>> WELL, FIRST OF ALL, I JUST

1475
00:37:02,379 --> 00:37:03,620
WANT TO SAY NO ONE'S PERFECT,

1476
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,310
YOU KNOW.

1477
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,689
I DID MAKE PLENTY OF MISTAKES.

1478
00:37:05,689 --> 00:37:06,896
I AM GUILTY OF BEING A BAD

1479
00:37:06,896 --> 00:37:07,896
BOYFRIEND.

1480
00:37:07,896 --> 00:37:08,862
I DIDN'T CHEAT ON HER.

1481
00:37:08,862 --> 00:37:09,655
>> YOU DIDN'T CHEAT ON HER?

1482
00:37:09,655 --> 00:37:11,000
>> I DID BREAK UP WITH HER,

1483
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:14,034
AND THE NEXT DAY, I DID HOOK UP

1484
00:37:14,034 --> 00:37:15,172
WITH A GIRL AND...

1485
00:37:15,172 --> 00:37:16,724
>> APRIL, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1486
00:37:16,724 --> 00:37:18,103
>> RYAN HAS A WAY OF TWISTING

1487
00:37:18,103 --> 00:37:19,068
THE TRUTH.

1488
00:37:19,068 --> 00:37:20,896
>> ISN'T THAT CALLED LYING?

1489
00:37:20,896 --> 00:37:22,413
>> YEAH, IN MY BOOK, IT IS.

1490
00:37:22,413 --> 00:37:24,448
>> APRIL, YOU LOOK DISTRAUGHT.

1491
00:37:24,448 --> 00:37:26,000
>> [sighs]

1492
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:26,655
THE WHOLE THING'S VERY

1493
00:37:26,655 --> 00:37:27,310
STRESSFUL.

1494
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,448
>> IT IS VERY STRESSFUL.

1495
00:37:28,448 --> 00:37:30,965
>> YEAH, AND IT DOESN'T SEEM

1496
00:37:30,965 --> 00:37:31,896
LIKE IT'S GOING TO GET ANY

1497
00:37:31,896 --> 00:37:32,724
BETTER.

1498
00:37:32,724 --> 00:37:34,620
THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED.

1499
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,896
>> DID YOU TALK ABOUT SEX?

1500
00:37:35,896 --> 00:37:37,379
>> WE DID, BUT JAMIE TRIED TO

1501
00:37:37,379 --> 00:37:39,068
TALK TO ME, AND IT'S MY FAULT.

1502
00:37:39,068 --> 00:37:39,896
SHE DID.

1503
00:37:39,896 --> 00:37:40,965
SHE ASKED ME TO PUT HER ON THE

1504
00:37:40,965 --> 00:37:43,965
PILL, AND I HAD MY HEAD IN THE

1505
00:37:43,965 --> 00:37:45,034
CLOUDS OR SOMETHING.

1506
00:37:45,034 --> 00:37:46,344
I'M NOT SURE--I DON'T KNOW WHAT

1507
00:37:46,344 --> 00:37:48,862
WAS GOING ON, AND...

1508
00:37:48,862 --> 00:37:51,793
I WAS LIKE, "NO, YOU NEED TO NOT

1509
00:37:51,793 --> 00:37:53,344
BE HAVING SEX."

1510
00:37:53,344 --> 00:37:54,862
I WAS STUPID, IN HINDSIGHT.

1511
00:37:54,862 --> 00:37:57,034
>> IT'S NOT STUPIDITY.

1512
00:37:57,034 --> 00:37:57,758
IT'S JUST HARD.

1513
00:37:57,758 --> 00:37:58,551
THESE ARE HARD THINGS TO DEAL

1514
00:37:58,551 --> 00:37:59,241
WITH.

1515
00:37:59,241 --> 00:38:00,448
GOING FORWARD, DO WE HAVE A

1516
00:38:00,448 --> 00:38:02,482
CIVIL SORT OF RELATIONSHIP

1517
00:38:02,482 --> 00:38:03,655
GOING FORWARD, OR YOU GUYS CAN'T

1518
00:38:03,655 --> 00:38:04,586
EVEN BE AROUND EACH OTHER?

1519
00:38:04,586 --> 00:38:05,724
>> WE DON'T SPEAK.

1520
00:38:05,724 --> 00:38:07,344
I'M JUST TO THE POINT WHERE--

1521
00:38:07,344 --> 00:38:08,172
>> SHE'S BLOCKED MY NUMBER,

1522
00:38:08,172 --> 00:38:09,103
SO I CAN'T EVEN ASK HOW MY

1523
00:38:09,103 --> 00:38:10,931
DAUGHTER'S DOING.

1524
00:38:10,931 --> 00:38:12,655
>> YOU SEE HER EVERY WEEK.

1525
00:38:12,655 --> 00:38:14,862
>> ONCE A WEEK FOR AN HOUR.

1526
00:38:14,862 --> 00:38:17,482
A COP ESCORTS ME IN AND ESCORTS

1527
00:38:17,482 --> 00:38:19,103
ME OUT, LIKE A CRIMINAL.

1528
00:38:19,103 --> 00:38:20,000
>> YOU JUST HAVE TO EARN YOUR

1529
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:21,206
TRUST.

1530
00:38:21,206 --> 00:38:22,034
>> HOW COME WHEN YOU'RE WITH ME

1531
00:38:22,034 --> 00:38:24,413
YOU CAN TRUST ME TO BE AROUND

1532
00:38:24,413 --> 00:38:25,068
MY DAUGHTER...

1533
00:38:25,068 --> 00:38:26,310
>> BECAUSE I KNOW YOU'RE NOT

1534
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:27,310
DOING ANYTHING YOU'RE NOT

1535
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,172
SUPPOSED TO, 'CAUSE I KNOW

1536
00:38:28,172 --> 00:38:29,034
YOU'RE NOT HANGING OUT WITH THE

1537
00:38:29,034 --> 00:38:29,862
BAD PEOPLE OR DOING THE BAD

1538
00:38:29,862 --> 00:38:30,827
THINGS BECAUSE I'M THERE

1539
00:38:30,827 --> 00:38:31,827
WATCHING YOU.

1540
00:38:31,827 --> 00:38:33,551
BUT WHEN I'M NOT THERE, I DON'T

1541
00:38:33,551 --> 00:38:34,379
KNOW.

1542
00:38:34,379 --> 00:38:35,241
YOU COULD BE TAKING HER TO THE

1543
00:38:35,241 --> 00:38:35,931
POOL HALL.

1544
00:38:35,931 --> 00:38:37,413
YOU COULD BE TAKING HER TO THE

1545
00:38:37,413 --> 00:38:38,931
GIRLS THAT YOU HANG OUT WITH.

1546
00:38:38,931 --> 00:38:39,620
YOU COULD BE TAKING HER

1547
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,931
ANYWHERE, DOING WHATEVER.

1548
00:38:40,931 --> 00:38:41,689
>> WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

1549
00:38:41,689 --> 00:38:42,862
YOU COULD TALK TO MY STEPMOM.

1550
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:43,965
>> WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

1551
00:38:43,965 --> 00:38:44,862
WHY WOULD YOU DO WHAT YOU'VE

1552
00:38:44,862 --> 00:38:46,206
DONE SINCE I WAS PREGNANT?

1553
00:38:46,206 --> 00:38:48,068
>> WELL, LET ME ASK YOU THIS,

1554
00:38:48,068 --> 00:38:49,034
WHAT KIND OF RELATIONSHIP DO YOU

1555
00:38:49,034 --> 00:38:50,413
WANT RYAN TO HAVE WITH MIAH

1556
00:38:50,413 --> 00:38:51,655
IN THE FUTURE?

1557
00:38:51,655 --> 00:38:53,551
>> I WANT HIM TO BE AROUND.

1558
00:38:53,551 --> 00:38:55,000
>> YOU DO WANT HIM TO BE AROUND.

1559
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,931
YOU WANT HIM TO BUILT THAT TRUST

1560
00:38:55,931 --> 00:38:57,000
AND HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH

1561
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,379
HER.

1562
00:38:58,379 --> 00:38:59,482
>> I MEAN, LIKE, IF HE REALLY

1563
00:38:59,482 --> 00:39:01,724
DOES GOOD FOR A LONG TIME,

1564
00:39:01,724 --> 00:39:03,310
LIKE, IT'S NOT LIKE I'M GOING TO

1565
00:39:03,310 --> 00:39:04,551
KEEP HER AWAY FOREVER.

1566
00:39:04,551 --> 00:39:05,448
WHEN SHE GETS OLDER, SHE'S GOING

1567
00:39:05,448 --> 00:39:06,379
TO BE LIKE, "MOMMY, CAN I GO

1568
00:39:06,379 --> 00:39:07,413
WITH DADDY HERE?"

1569
00:39:07,413 --> 00:39:08,827
AND I WANT TO BE ABLE TO BE

1570
00:39:08,827 --> 00:39:10,896
LIKE, "YEAH, HONEY, GO ON."

1571
00:39:10,896 --> 00:39:12,310
>> DID YOU MISS JAMIE'S LABOR?

1572
00:39:12,310 --> 00:39:13,620
>> I WAS THERE FOR THE BABY

1573
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,448
BEING BORN.

1574
00:39:14,448 --> 00:39:15,724
I WAS THERE AN HOUR BEFORE THE

1575
00:39:15,724 --> 00:39:16,862
BABY WAS BORN.

1576
00:39:16,862 --> 00:39:18,000
>> SO DO YOU WANT TO TRY TO SET

1577
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:18,965
THE RECORD STRAIGHT ABOUT WHAT

1578
00:39:18,965 --> 00:39:20,689
REALLY HAPPENED THAT NIGHT?

1579
00:39:20,689 --> 00:39:22,310
>> I WAS AT MY FRIEND'S HOUSE.

1580
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:23,517
>> WHO?

1581
00:39:23,517 --> 00:39:24,517
>> MATT.

1582
00:39:24,517 --> 00:39:25,517
>> OKAY, MATT'S HOUSE.

1583
00:39:25,517 --> 00:39:26,517
WHAT WERE YOU DOING THERE?

1584
00:39:26,517 --> 00:39:27,724
SHE'S HAVING A BABY?

1585
00:39:27,724 --> 00:39:29,137
>> I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS HAVING

1586
00:39:29,137 --> 00:39:30,206
A BABY YET.

1587
00:39:30,206 --> 00:39:31,344
>> YOU GUYS ARE HANGING OUT.

1588
00:39:31,344 --> 00:39:32,517
>> MY PHONE WAS DEAD.

1589
00:39:32,517 --> 00:39:33,793
>> HOW DID YOU GET A HICKEY ON

1590
00:39:33,793 --> 00:39:34,965
YOUR NECK?

1591
00:39:34,965 --> 00:39:35,931
>> HUH?

1592
00:39:35,931 --> 00:39:36,689
>> HOW DID YOU GET A HICKEY ON

1593
00:39:36,689 --> 00:39:37,344
YOUR NECK?

1594
00:39:37,344 --> 00:39:39,000
>> I TOLD YOU. A GIRL.

1595
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,793
>> YEAH, 'CAUSE YOU HAD SEX

1596
00:39:39,793 --> 00:39:40,517
WITH ANOTHER GIRL.

1597
00:39:40,517 --> 00:39:41,793
>> YEAH, THAT WAS AFTER WE

1598
00:39:41,793 --> 00:39:42,482
BROKE UP.

1599
00:39:42,482 --> 00:39:43,379
WE WAS ALREADY BROKEN UP BEFORE

1600
00:39:43,379 --> 00:39:44,172
THAT.

1601
00:39:44,172 --> 00:39:44,965
>> TWO DAYS.

1602
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:45,965
>> BY THE WAY...

1603
00:39:45,965 --> 00:39:46,793
>> I ADMITTED THAT WHEN I FIRST

1604
00:39:46,793 --> 00:39:47,586
CAME ON THE SHOW.

1605
00:39:47,586 --> 00:39:48,758
I MEAN, I SCREWED UP, YEAH.

1606
00:39:48,758 --> 00:39:49,896
I DIDN'T CHEAT ON HER, THOUGH.

1607
00:39:49,896 --> 00:39:50,620
THAT'S NOT CHEATING.

1608
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,344
>> I KNOW AS A YOUNG GIRL,

1609
00:39:51,344 --> 00:39:52,000
THIS KIND OF STUFF HAS

1610
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,620
MONUMENTAL MEANING, BUT THAT'S,

1611
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,758
AGAIN, ANOTHER REASON WHY YOUNG

1612
00:39:55,758 --> 00:39:57,517
PEOPLE, YOU KNOW, CAN'T HANDLE

1613
00:39:57,517 --> 00:39:59,620
HAVING KIDS, BECAUSE THIS IS HOW

1614
00:39:59,620 --> 00:40:00,655
YOUNG PEOPLE TREAT EACH OTHER IN

1615
00:40:00,655 --> 00:40:01,448
RELATIONSHIPS.

1616
00:40:01,448 --> 00:40:03,000
YOU'RE NOT ALONE WITH THAT.

1617
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,448
BUT WHEN YOU PUT A KID IN THERE,

1618
00:40:04,448 --> 00:40:06,310
IT HAS BIG MEANING.

1619
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,344
>> AND THAT'S WHY WE KEEP--

1620
00:40:07,344 --> 00:40:09,758
THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO SEPARATE

1621
00:40:09,758 --> 00:40:12,517
AND, LIKE, COOL OFF.

1622
00:40:12,517 --> 00:40:15,482
HE CAN STILL HER, AND THEN WE'LL

1623
00:40:15,482 --> 00:40:17,172
MATURE, HE'LL BE ABLE TO SEE HER

1624
00:40:17,172 --> 00:40:18,862
STILL, AND THEN EVENTUALLY,

1625
00:40:18,862 --> 00:40:19,896
IT'LL BE ABLE TO BE A WORKING

1626
00:40:19,896 --> 00:40:21,586
RELATIONSHIP.

1627
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:22,482
>> HOPEFULLY.

1628
00:40:22,482 --> 00:40:23,724
>> HOPEFULLY.

1629
00:40:23,724 --> 00:40:24,896
>> AGAIN, IT'S MESSY.

1630
00:40:24,896 --> 00:40:27,068
IT'S HARD TO SAY SOMETHING THAT

1631
00:40:27,068 --> 00:40:28,620
WRAPS UP STORIES LIKE THIS,

1632
00:40:28,620 --> 00:40:29,965
'CAUSE IT'S YOUR LIFE NOW.

1633
00:40:29,965 --> 00:40:32,000
IT'S GOING TO BE ONGOING.

1634
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,827
BUT, YOU KNOW, I COMMEND YOU FOR

1635
00:40:33,827 --> 00:40:35,172
ALL--APRIL, THANK YOU FOR

1636
00:40:35,172 --> 00:40:36,655
STAYING IN HER LIFE.

1637
00:40:36,655 --> 00:40:37,689
JAMIE, KEEP GOING AT SCHOOL.

1638
00:40:37,689 --> 00:40:40,000
RYAN, I REALLY HOPE YOU SUCCEED.

1639
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,862
IF YOU DO, I'LL BE THE FIRST ONE

1640
00:40:41,862 --> 00:40:44,862
TO CHEER YOU ON.

1641
00:40:44,862 --> 00:40:45,655
I HOPE SO.

1642
00:40:45,655 --> 00:40:48,034
ALL RIGHT, WELL, MORE WITH JAMIE

1643
00:40:48,034 --> 00:40:49,551
LATER WHEN THE MOMS GET TO ASK

1644
00:40:49,551 --> 00:40:51,034
EACH OTHER QUESTIONS.

1645
00:40:51,034 --> 00:40:52,551
BUT FOR NOW, WE'RE GOING TO STEP

1646
00:40:52,551 --> 00:40:54,172
ASIDE FOR A BREAK AND RETURN

1647
00:40:54,172 --> 00:40:55,482
WITH CLEONDRA.

1648
00:40:55,482 --> 00:40:56,655
NOW, THERE WERE MANY QUESTIONS

1649
00:40:56,655 --> 00:40:58,241
ABOUT WHERE BABY KYLEE SHOULD BE

1650
00:40:58,241 --> 00:41:00,068
STAYING, SO WHERE IS SHE,

1651
00:41:00,068 --> 00:41:01,241
AND WHERE IS CLEONDRA LIVING

1652
00:41:01,241 --> 00:41:02,206
RIGHT NOW?

1653
00:41:02,206 --> 00:41:03,310
THAT, ALONG WITH SOME BREAKING

1654
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,448
NEWS ABOUT HER RELATIONSHIP

1655
00:41:04,448 --> 00:41:05,827
WITH KYLEE'S DAD, MARIO,

1656
00:41:05,827 --> 00:41:07,655
NEXT.

1657
00:41:07,655 --> 00:41:10,482
NEXT.
[applause]

1658
00:41:10,482 --> 00:41:21,551
[applause]

1659
00:41:21,551 --> 00:41:22,827
[applause]

1660
00:41:22,827 --> 00:41:23,896
>> WE'RE BACK WITH MORE LIFE

1661
00:41:23,896 --> 00:41:25,275
 AFTER LABOR.

1662
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:26,482
IT'S THE 16 AND PREGNANT FINALE

1663
00:41:26,482 --> 00:41:27,655
 SPECIAL,HOSTED BY MYSELF,

1664
00:41:27,655 --> 00:41:28,689
DR. DREW.

1665
00:41:28,689 --> 00:41:30,655
OKAY, OUR NEXT MOM CLEONDRA IS

00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:31,689
HERE WITH MY NOW.

1667
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:33,137
SHE'S JOINED BY BABY KYLEE'S

1668
00:41:33,137 --> 00:41:35,172
FATHER, MARIO, AND BEFORE WE

1669
00:41:35,172 --> 00:41:36,586
TALK FURTHER, LET'S TAKE A LOOK

1670
00:41:36,586 --> 00:41:38,724
BACK AT CLEONDRA'S TIME BEING 16

1671
00:41:38,724 --> 00:41:43,896
AND PREGNANT.

1672
00:41:43,896 --> 00:41:45,206
>> WHEN WE FIRST OUT I WAS

1673
00:41:45,206 --> 00:41:47,137
PREGNANT, I WAS SCARED.

1674
00:41:47,137 --> 00:41:47,965
>> GOT A LITTLE BABY IN YOUR

1675
00:41:47,965 --> 00:41:49,655
STOMACH.

1676
00:41:49,655 --> 00:41:51,586
>> I THOUGHT THAT YOU WOULDN'T

1677
00:41:51,586 --> 00:41:52,931
END UP IN THE SITUATION

1678
00:41:52,931 --> 00:41:53,827
YOU'RE IN.

1679
00:41:53,827 --> 00:41:54,689
>> I JUST DON'T LIKE LOOKING

1680
00:41:54,689 --> 00:41:56,655
BACK ON IT, 'CAUSE IT STILL

1681
00:41:56,655 --> 00:41:59,758
DISAPPOINTS ME.

1682
00:41:59,758 --> 00:42:00,586
I FEEL LIKE YOU'LL STAY HERE

1683
00:42:00,586 --> 00:42:02,344
AT THE BEGINNING A LOT MORE.

1684
00:42:02,344 --> 00:42:03,172
>> I AIN'T GOING TO BE OVER

1685
00:42:03,172 --> 00:42:04,310
HERE, NO.

1686
00:42:04,310 --> 00:42:05,241
IF SHE DOESN'T MOVE IN, THIS

1687
00:42:05,241 --> 00:42:06,827
ISN'T GOING TO WORK.

1688
00:42:06,827 --> 00:42:08,620
I MEAN, ME AND HER ISN'T GOING

1689
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:09,655
TO WORK.

1690
00:42:09,655 --> 00:42:11,068
>> NO!

1691
00:42:11,068 --> 00:42:12,551
AH...

1692
00:42:12,551 --> 00:42:13,517
>> BIG BREATH, CHIN TO YOUR

1693
00:42:13,517 --> 00:42:15,724
CHEST, AND PUSH.

1694
00:42:15,724 --> 00:42:18,551
[baby crying]

1695
00:42:18,551 --> 00:42:19,620
>> I MEAN, YOU CAN EASILY STAY

1696
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:20,275
HERE.

1697
00:42:20,275 --> 00:42:21,758
>> I CAN STAY HERE TONIGHT.

1698
00:42:21,758 --> 00:42:23,517
I'M JUST NOT GOING TO.

1699
00:42:23,517 --> 00:42:24,482
>> IT SEEMS LIKE YOU DON'T EVEN

1700
00:42:24,482 --> 00:42:25,758
CARE ABOUT ME ANYMORE OR

1701
00:42:25,758 --> 00:42:26,931
NOTHING.

1702
00:42:26,931 --> 00:42:28,103
>> A BABY CHANGES THINGS.

1703
00:42:28,103 --> 00:42:30,344
A BABY CHANGES PEOPLE'S LIVES.

1704
00:42:30,344 --> 00:42:31,206
>> WHY DON'T YOU LET HER SPEND

1705
00:42:31,206 --> 00:42:32,275
THE NIGHT AT MY HOUSE SO YOU CAN

1706
00:42:32,275 --> 00:42:33,586
HAVE A DAY TO SLEEP?

1707
00:42:33,586 --> 00:42:35,275
>> IF YOU CAN'T COMPROMISE NOW,

1708
00:42:35,275 --> 00:42:36,103
YOU DAMN SURE AIN'T GOING TO BE

1709
00:42:36,103 --> 00:42:37,000
ABLE TO COMPROMISE TOGETHER

1710
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:40,482
LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE.

1711
00:42:40,482 --> 00:42:41,379
>> ALL RIGHT, CLEONDRA.

1712
00:42:41,379 --> 00:42:42,275
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS?

1713
00:42:42,275 --> 00:42:43,310
HOW DO YOU FEEL WATCHING THAT?

1714
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,103
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1715
00:42:44,103 --> 00:42:45,000
IT'S A LOT.

1716
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:45,931
>> IT'S A LOT TO TAKE IN.

1717
00:42:45,931 --> 00:42:46,965
>> YEAH.

1718
00:42:46,965 --> 00:42:48,000
>> HOW'S YOUR GUYS' RELATIONSHIP

1719
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:48,793
NOW?

1720
00:42:48,793 --> 00:42:49,965
>> NOT DOING SO GOOD.

1721
00:42:49,965 --> 00:42:51,172
>> HOW COME?

1722
00:42:51,172 --> 00:42:52,068
>> WE JUST AREN'T GETTING ALONG

1723
00:42:52,068 --> 00:42:53,482
TOO WELL LATELY.

1724
00:42:53,482 --> 00:42:54,724
LIKE, THE PAST TWO WEEKS.

1725
00:42:54,724 --> 00:42:55,862
>> CLEONDRA LOOKS PISSED.

1726
00:42:55,862 --> 00:42:57,310
>> YEAH, SHE DOES.

1727
00:42:57,310 --> 00:42:58,413
>> WHAT ARE YOU PISSED ABOUT?

1728
00:42:58,413 --> 00:43:01,310
>> JUST OUR RELATIONSHIP.

1729
00:43:01,310 --> 00:43:02,551
IT'S A HOT MESS.

1730
00:43:02,551 --> 00:43:04,379
EVERYTHING'S JUST FALLING APART.

1731
00:43:04,379 --> 00:43:05,482
>> IT'S A HOT MESS.

1732
00:43:05,482 --> 00:43:07,206
WHAT'S SHE TALKING ABOUT, MARIO?

1733
00:43:07,206 --> 00:43:09,965
>> I'M NOT QUITE TOO SURE.

1734
00:43:09,965 --> 00:43:11,103
I GUESS SHE JUST--

1735
00:43:11,103 --> 00:43:13,448
WHAT'S SUCH A HOT MESS?

1736
00:43:13,448 --> 00:43:14,206
>> I MEAN, WE'RE JUST NOT

1737
00:43:14,206 --> 00:43:15,482
GETTING ALONG, AND EVERYTHING

1738
00:43:15,482 --> 00:43:17,551
SEEMS TO BE MY FAULT.

1739
00:43:17,551 --> 00:43:18,206
>> OH.

1740
00:43:18,206 --> 00:43:18,896
IS HE BLAMING YOU FOR

1741
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:19,551
EVERYTHING?

1742
00:43:19,551 --> 00:43:20,241
>> SEEMS LIKE IT.

1743
00:43:20,241 --> 00:43:21,000
>> OR ARE YOU BLAMING HIM FOR

1744
00:43:21,000 --> 00:43:21,724
EVERYTHING?

1745
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:22,379
>> NO.

1746
00:43:22,379 --> 00:43:23,344
HE SITS UP THERE AND SAYS WE

1747
00:43:23,344 --> 00:43:25,586
DON'T COMMUNICATE.

1748
00:43:25,586 --> 00:43:27,068
I TRY TO COMMUNICATE WITH HIM.

1749
00:43:27,068 --> 00:43:29,551
THEN HE GETS MAD ABOUT, LIKE,

1750
00:43:29,551 --> 00:43:30,758
HOW I'M FEELING.

1751
00:43:30,758 --> 00:43:33,034
HOW I'M FEELING.
>> HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

1752
00:43:33,034 --> 00:43:40,000
>> HOW ARE YOU FEELING?

1753
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,000
>> BROKEN.

1754
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,137
>> YOU FEEL BROKEN?

1755
00:43:42,137 --> 00:43:44,758
>> YOU FEEL BROKEN?
HOW COME?

1756
00:43:44,758 --> 00:43:47,689
HOW COME?

1757
00:43:47,689 --> 00:43:48,517
>> 'CAUSE WE'RE JUST FALLING

1758
00:43:48,517 --> 00:43:51,448
APART.

1759
00:43:51,448 --> 00:43:52,689
AND I JUST WANT KYLEE TO HAVE A

1760
00:43:52,689 --> 00:43:55,413
FAMILY--A MOM AND DAD IN HER

1761
00:43:55,413 --> 00:43:57,344
LIFE.

1762
00:43:57,344 --> 00:43:59,000
>> IS IT POSSIBLE, CLEONDRA,

1763
00:43:59,000 --> 00:44:01,310
THAT YOU'RE PUSHING MARIO AWAY?

1764
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:02,724
>> I DON'T SEE HOW.

1765
00:44:02,724 --> 00:44:03,551
>> I GET THE FEELING YOU ARE

1766
00:44:03,551 --> 00:44:06,586
PUSHING HIM AWAY.

1767
00:44:06,586 --> 00:44:08,000
DO YOU WANT THIS TO WORK OUT?

1768
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:09,000
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1769
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:10,413
I'VE NEVER GONE THROUGH A HARD

1770
00:44:10,413 --> 00:44:11,965
BREAK OR ANYTHING.

1771
00:44:11,965 --> 00:44:13,793
MARIO'S MY FIRST LOVE,

1772
00:44:13,793 --> 00:44:14,758
EVERYTHING.

1773
00:44:14,758 --> 00:44:15,586
>> BUT YOU WANT TO WORK IT OUT.

1774
00:44:15,586 --> 00:44:16,413
>> YEAH, I WANT TO WORK IT OUT.

1775
00:44:16,413 --> 00:44:17,965
>> SO IT STARTS LOOKING LIKE

1776
00:44:17,965 --> 00:44:19,448
YOU'RE TOO AFRAID THAT HE'S

1777
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:21,620
GOING TO LEAVE, RIGHT?

1778
00:44:21,620 --> 00:44:24,586
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF YOU RISKED

1779
00:44:24,586 --> 00:44:25,310
GETTING BACK INTO THIS

1780
00:44:25,310 --> 00:44:29,655
RELATIONSHIP?

1781
00:44:29,655 --> 00:44:34,379
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1782
00:44:34,379 --> 00:44:36,689
>> MARIO, WHEN PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

1783
00:44:36,689 --> 00:44:38,724
ABANDONED, THEY EXPECT

1784
00:44:38,724 --> 00:44:40,344
ABANDONMENT, AND WHEN THEY DON'T

1785
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,862
GET IT, IT FEELS CLINGY AND

1786
00:44:41,862 --> 00:44:43,000
VULNERABLE AND UNCOMFORTABLE

1787
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,724
AND THEY USUALLY SABOTAGE IT.

1788
00:44:44,724 --> 00:44:46,000
SOUND FAMILIAR?

1789
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:46,827
>> YES.

1790
00:44:46,827 --> 00:44:48,862
WE WERE FINE UP UNTIL SHE JUST

1791
00:44:48,862 --> 00:44:51,275
STARTED BEING OUT EVERYWHERE.

1792
00:44:51,275 --> 00:44:52,586
WE WERE FINE UP UNTIL--

1793
00:44:52,586 --> 00:44:53,586
>> I'M SORRY!

1794
00:44:53,586 --> 00:44:56,517
LOOK, I LIKE TO...

1795
00:44:56,517 --> 00:44:57,827
OKAY, BEING A TEEN PARENT,

1796
00:44:57,827 --> 00:44:58,862
YOU KNOW YOU DON'T GET TO DO

1797
00:44:58,862 --> 00:44:59,620
NOTHING.

1798
00:44:59,620 --> 00:45:01,413
>> YEAH, I DON'T KNOW NOTHING

1799
00:45:01,413 --> 00:45:02,068
ABOUT THAT.

1800
00:45:02,068 --> 00:45:02,793
WHAT DO I EVER GO TO DO?

1801
00:45:02,793 --> 00:45:03,793
>> YOU'RE IN SCHOOL STILL?

1802
00:45:03,793 --> 00:45:04,862
>> YES, AND I WORK A FULL-TIME

1803
00:45:04,862 --> 00:45:05,586
JOB.

1804
00:45:05,586 --> 00:45:06,241
>> WOW.

1805
00:45:06,241 --> 00:45:07,103
>> AND I DON'T COME HOME TILL

1806
00:45:07,103 --> 00:45:07,862
7:00 AT NIGHT.

1807
00:45:07,862 --> 00:45:08,793
>> THAT'S WHY HIS FAMILY'S

1808
00:45:08,793 --> 00:45:09,689
INVOLVED IN THE CHILDCARE?

1809
00:45:09,689 --> 00:45:10,344
>> YES.

1810
00:45:10,344 --> 00:45:12,034
EVERYBODY--WE HAVE, LIKE, THE

1811
00:45:12,034 --> 00:45:13,413
BEST SUPPORT SYSTEM.

1812
00:45:13,413 --> 00:45:15,275
SO IF WE NEED SOMEBODY TO WATCH

1813
00:45:15,275 --> 00:45:17,517
HER, THEY WILL WATCH HER.

1814
00:45:17,517 --> 00:45:18,241
>> DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE

1815
00:45:18,241 --> 00:45:19,172
SPENDING ENOUGH TIME WITH HER?

1816
00:45:19,172 --> 00:45:20,275
>> NO, AND I HATE IT.

1817
00:45:20,275 --> 00:45:23,172
I HATE THAT...

1818
00:45:23,172 --> 00:45:26,068
I HATE THAT...
>> THAT WHAT?

1819
00:45:26,068 --> 00:45:31,000
>> THAT WHAT?

1820
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,206
HATE THAT OTHER PEOPLE WATCH

1821
00:45:32,206 --> 00:45:33,206
HER?

1822
00:45:33,206 --> 00:45:34,413
YEAH.

1823
00:45:34,413 --> 00:45:35,379
WELL, YOU'RE LUCKY TO HAVE THAT,

1824
00:45:35,379 --> 00:45:36,379
THOUGH, RIGHT?

1825
00:45:36,379 --> 00:45:37,241
>> I KNOW, BUT I'D RATHER IT BE

1826
00:45:37,241 --> 00:45:39,517
ME THAN OTHER PEOPLE.

1827
00:45:39,517 --> 00:45:40,344
>> OF COURSE.

1828
00:45:40,344 --> 00:45:42,068
>> 'CAUSE IT'S LIKE, WITH MY

1829
00:45:42,068 --> 00:45:44,482
MOM, SHE RAISED FOUR KIDS BY

1830
00:45:44,482 --> 00:45:48,413
HERSELF AND WORKING TWO JOBS.

1831
00:45:48,413 --> 00:45:51,586
AND, I MEAN, SHE SAW US, BUT

1832
00:45:51,586 --> 00:45:52,896
IT WASN'T, LIKE, ENOUGH THAT A

1833
00:45:52,896 --> 00:45:54,655
MOM WANTS WITH THEIR CHILDREN.

1834
00:45:54,655 --> 00:45:57,758
>> AND YOU KNOW THAT FIRST-HAND.

1835
00:45:57,758 --> 00:45:59,586
MARIO, DO YOU LOVE CLEONDRA?

1836
00:45:59,586 --> 00:46:02,034
>> YEAH.

1837
00:46:02,034 --> 00:46:03,206
>> CAN YOU REALLY TELL HER THAT

1838
00:46:03,206 --> 00:46:05,275
IN A WAY THAT SHE CAN HEAR YOU?

1839
00:46:05,275 --> 00:46:06,103
PUT YOUR HAND RIGHT HERE ON HER

1840
00:46:06,103 --> 00:46:07,551
HEART.

1841
00:46:07,551 --> 00:46:09,448
I WANT YOU TO LOOK AT HIM.

1842
00:46:09,448 --> 00:46:11,758
>> I DO LOVE YOU.

1843
00:46:11,758 --> 00:46:12,793
>> CLEONDRA, YOU HAVE A TON

1844
00:46:12,793 --> 00:46:16,931
TO BE THANKFUL FOR.

1845
00:46:16,931 --> 00:46:19,000
HALF OF THE TEEN MOM, DADS DON'T

1846
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,068
STICK AROUND.

1847
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:21,034
MARIO IS SHOWING A LOT OF

1848
00:46:21,034 --> 00:46:22,000
WILLINGNESS.

1849
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:22,827
THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES TO GET

1850

00:46:23,965 --> 00:46:26,206

00:46:41,241 --> 00:46:43,103
DON'T GO AWAY.

1866
00:46:43,103 --> 00:46:45,724
DON'T GO AWAY.
[applause]

1867
00:46:45,724 --> 00:46:54,344
[applause]

1868
00:46:54,344 --> 00:46:56,862
[applause]

1869
00:46:56,862 --> 00:46:57,862
>> WELCOME BACK TO THE 16 AND

1870
00:46:57,862 --> 00:46:59,413
 PREGNANT FINALE SPECIAL.

1871
00:46:59,413 --> 00:47:02,000
I AM DR. DREW, AND OUR NEXT TEEN

1872
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,034
MOTHER IS KAYLA.

1873
00:47:03,034 --> 00:47:07,172
HERE IS HER JOURNEY.

1874
00:47:07,172 --> 00:47:08,000
>> I DIDN'T BELIEVE IT WHEN YOU

1875
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:08,965
TOLD ME.

1876
00:47:08,965 --> 00:47:09,620
>> WHEN I TOLD YOU I WAS

1877
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:10,275
PREGNANT?

1878
00:47:10,275 --> 00:47:10,965
>> YEAH.

1879
00:47:10,965 --> 00:47:11,862
>> DO YOU THINK YOU'LL TRY TO BE

1880
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:13,000
AROUND MORE WHEN THE BABY'S

1881
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:13,724
HERE?

1882
00:47:13,724 --> 00:47:15,310
>> ABSOLUTELY.

1883
00:47:15,310 --> 00:47:16,655
>> AND HOW COME YOU'RE NOT NOW?

1884
00:47:16,655 --> 00:47:17,965
I JUST WISH SHE WOULD SEE,

1885
00:47:17,965 --> 00:47:19,724
"OH, GEE, THERE'S A REASON MY

1886
00:47:19,724 --> 00:47:20,724
DAUGHTER'S UNHAPPY."

1887
00:47:20,724 --> 00:47:21,448
>> YEAH.

1888
00:47:21,448 --> 00:47:22,241
>> BUT SHE DOESN'T SEE IT THAT

1889
00:47:22,241 --> 00:47:23,000
WAY.

1890
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:23,896
WHEN I WAS 13, I WAS

1891
00:47:23,896 --> 00:47:25,827
HOSPITALIZED FOR ANOREXIA.

1892
00:47:25,827 --> 00:47:27,068
IT'S SO HARD FOR ME BEING

1893
00:47:27,068 --> 00:47:28,241
PREGNANT AND GAINING ALL THIS

1894
00:47:28,241 --> 00:47:29,793
WEIGHT WITHOUT ANY CONTROL.

1895
00:47:29,793 --> 00:47:31,000
I FEEL REALLY LIGHT-HEADED.

1896
00:47:31,000 --> 00:47:31,827
I NEED TO STOP.

1897
00:47:31,827 --> 00:47:32,689
>> ALL SHE ATE WAS VANILLA

1898
00:47:32,689 --> 00:47:33,482
WAFERS THIS MORNING.

1899
00:47:33,482 --> 00:47:34,862
DO YOU WANT TO CALL YOUR DOCTOR?

1900
00:47:34,862 --> 00:47:35,724
>> HAVE HER GO TO LABOR AND

1901
00:47:35,724 --> 00:47:36,413
DELIVERY NOW.

1902
00:47:36,413 --> 00:47:37,206
>> OH, MY GOD.

1903
00:47:37,206 --> 00:47:38,793
I'M SO SCARED.

1904
00:47:38,793 --> 00:47:39,758
>> THE LIGHT-HEADED AND

1905
00:47:39,758 --> 00:47:40,517
DIZZINESS OFTEN TIMES WILL

1906
00:47:40,517 --> 00:47:41,517
HAPPEN IF YOU HAVEN'T EAT OR

1907
00:47:41,517 --> 00:47:42,448
DRINK A WHOLE LOT,

1908
00:47:42,448 --> 00:47:44,137
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE PREGNANT.

1909
00:47:44,137 --> 00:47:44,965
>> MICHAEL!

1910
00:47:44,965 --> 00:47:46,103
I JUST FELT LIKE I'M, LIKE,

1911
00:47:46,103 --> 00:47:49,172
LEAKING.

1912
00:47:49,172 --> 00:47:49,862
>> NOT YET.

1913
00:47:49,862 --> 00:47:50,862
I'LL LET YOU KNOW.

1914
00:47:50,862 --> 00:47:53,241
A LOT OF PRESSURE HERE.

1915
00:47:53,241 --> 00:47:56,413
A LOT OF PRESSURE HERE.
OH, CONGRATULATIONS.

1916
00:47:56,413 --> 00:47:57,413
OH, CONGRATULATIONS.

1917
00:47:57,413 --> 00:47:58,551
>> HE'S PERFECT.

1918
00:47:58,551 --> 00:48:00,379
>> YES, HE IS.

1919
00:48:00,379 --> 00:48:02,724
>> [crying]

1920
00:48:02,724 --> 00:48:04,931
>> WHY WON'T HE GO TO SLEEP?

1921
00:48:04,931 --> 00:48:05,724
>> ARE YOU GOING BACK TO WORK

1922
00:48:05,724 --> 00:48:06,793
TOMORROW?

1923
00:48:06,793 --> 00:48:07,448
>> YEAH.

1924
00:48:07,448 --> 00:48:08,103
>> SERIOUSLY?

1925
00:48:08,103 --> 00:48:09,068
>> HE'S YOURS.

1926
00:48:09,068 --> 00:48:10,000
>> DOESN'T IT JUST SEEM, LIKE, A

1927
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,034
LOT EASIER TO, LIKE, DROP OUT

1928
00:48:11,034 --> 00:48:12,310
AND GET YOUR GED?

1929
00:48:12,310 --> 00:48:13,068
>> I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU DO

1930
00:48:13,068 --> 00:48:13,758
THAT.

1931
00:48:13,758 --> 00:48:14,586
>> YOU GOT TO REALIZE YOU CAN'T

1932
00:48:14,586 --> 00:48:15,896
LIVE ANYWHERE FOR FREE.

1933
00:48:15,896 --> 00:48:17,103
IF MIKE'S GOING TO STAY HERE,

1934
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:19,448
HE NEEDS TO PAY $300 A MONTH.

1935
00:48:19,448 --> 00:48:20,482
>> THE HEAT GOES OUT AND WE HAVE

1936
00:48:20,482 --> 00:48:21,482
TO GET A HOTEL ROOM, AND I HAVE

1937
00:48:21,482 --> 00:48:22,137
TO PAY FOR IT ENTIRELY BY

1938
00:48:22,137 --> 00:48:22,896
MYSELF.

1939
00:48:22,896 --> 00:48:23,793
BUT YOU'RE ALL NICE AND WARM IN

1940
00:48:23,793 --> 00:48:24,793
YOUR BOYFRIEND'S HOUSE, SO IT

1941
00:48:24,793 --> 00:48:25,655
WASN'T THAT BIG OF A CONCERN

1942
00:48:25,655 --> 00:48:26,551
TO YOU.

1943
00:48:26,551 --> 00:48:27,448
YOU WANT ME TO GO ON A DIET WITH

1944
00:48:27,448 --> 00:48:28,172
YOU?

1945
00:48:28,172 --> 00:48:28,965
>> JUST START WATCHING WHAT

1946
00:48:28,965 --> 00:48:29,655
WE'RE EATING.

1947
00:48:29,655 --> 00:48:31,241
YOU COULD PROBABLY DISCIPLINE

1948
00:48:31,241 --> 00:48:32,517
ME, CONSIDERING WHAT YOU'VE GONE

1949
00:48:32,517 --> 00:48:34,482
THROUGH.

1950
00:48:34,482 --> 00:48:35,344
>> YOU WERE LIKE MY BEST FRIEND

1951
00:48:35,344 --> 00:48:37,137
BEFORE I GOT PREGNANT,

1952
00:48:37,137 --> 00:48:38,034
AND NOW I FEEL LIKE YOU CAN'T

1953
00:48:38,034 --> 00:48:39,724
EVEN STAND TO BE AROUND ME.

1954
00:48:39,724 --> 00:48:41,551
I JUST WANT THINGS TO GO BACK TO

1955
00:48:41,551 --> 00:48:44,344
I JUST WANT THINGS TO GO BACK TO
THE WAY THEY USED TO BE.

1956
00:48:44,344 --> 00:48:47,965
THE WAY THEY USED TO BE.

1957
00:48:47,965 --> 00:48:49,137
>> ALL RIGHT, KAYLA.

1958
00:48:49,137 --> 00:48:51,137
WHAT ARE THE TEARS ABOUT?

1959
00:48:51,137 --> 00:48:51,862
>> IT'S WEIRD SEEING IT

1960
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:53,137
ALTOGETHER.

1961
00:48:53,137 --> 00:48:53,931
>> ANYTHING PARTICULAR CUT

1962
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:56,379
THROUGH TO YOU?

1963
00:48:56,379 --> 00:48:57,103
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1964
00:48:57,103 --> 00:48:58,689
JUST STUFF WITH MY MOM.

1965
00:48:58,689 --> 00:48:59,482
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK WAS GOING

1966
00:48:59,482 --> 00:49:00,689
ON WITH HER?

1967
00:49:00,689 --> 00:49:01,965
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1968
00:49:01,965 --> 00:49:03,862
I FEEL LIKE SHE THOUGHT THAT I

1969
00:49:03,862 --> 00:49:05,862
COULD JUST TAKE CARE OF MYSELF,

1970
00:49:05,862 --> 00:49:07,655
WHICH I COULD, BUT IT JUST HURT

1971
00:49:07,655 --> 00:49:09,379
THAT SHE WAS KIND OF LIKE,

1972
00:49:09,379 --> 00:49:10,793
"OKAY, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.

1973
00:49:10,793 --> 00:49:11,827
YOU'RE FINE."

1974
00:49:11,827 --> 00:49:13,655
THAT KIND OF THING.

1975
00:49:13,655 --> 00:49:14,413
>> WAS THAT THE FIRST TIME IN

1976
00:49:14,413 --> 00:49:15,586
YOUR LIFE THAT SHE'S MADE YOU

1977
00:49:15,586 --> 00:49:18,034
FEEL LIKE THAT?

1978
00:49:18,034 --> 00:49:18,965
>> NO.

1979
00:49:18,965 --> 00:49:20,413
>> WHEN ELSE?

1980
00:49:20,413 --> 00:49:22,448
>> WHEN MY PARENTS GOT DIVORCED.

1981
00:49:22,448 --> 00:49:23,413
>> WHERE'S YOUR DAD?

1982
00:49:23,413 --> 00:49:24,448
>> I LIVE WITH HIM NOW.

1983
00:49:24,448 --> 00:49:25,379
>> YOU LIVE WITH YOUR DAD

1984
00:49:25,379 --> 00:49:26,482
AND NOT WITH DEB?

1985
00:49:26,482 --> 00:49:27,275
>> THERE WAS A POINT WHERE SHE

1986
00:49:27,275 --> 00:49:28,655
MOVED AWAY FROM ALL OF US KIDS,

1987
00:49:28,655 --> 00:49:32,068
AND THAT WAS HARD.

1988
00:49:32,068 --> 00:49:33,758
IT WAS SO EASY FOR HER TO PICK

1989
00:49:33,758 --> 00:49:36,931
UP AND LEAVE.

1990
00:49:36,931 --> 00:49:37,724
>> IS THAT WHEN YOUR EATING

1991
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:42,793
DISORDER STARTED?

1992
00:49:42,793 --> 00:49:45,551
HOW'S THE EATING DISORDER NOW?

1993
00:49:45,551 --> 00:49:47,586
>> IT'S PRETTY LOUD, AS THEY

1994
00:49:47,586 --> 00:49:50,551
CALL IT.

1995
00:49:50,551 --> 00:49:51,620
>> IT'S TALKING TO YOU?

1996
00:49:51,620 --> 00:49:53,206
>> YEAH.

1997
00:49:53,206 --> 00:49:53,896
>> OKAY.

1998
00:49:53,896 --> 00:49:54,827
AND HOW'S YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH

1999
00:49:54,827 --> 00:49:55,482
MIKE?

2000
00:49:55,482 --> 00:49:56,586
>> WE DON'T REALLY HAVE ONE.

2001
00:49:56,586 --> 00:49:57,241
>> YOU DON'T HAVE A

2002
00:49:57,241 --> 00:49:58,000
RELATIONSHIP WITH MIKE?

2003
00:49:58,000 --> 00:49:58,689
>> MM-MM.

2004
00:49:58,689 --> 00:49:59,862
>> WHAT HAPPENED?

2005
00:49:59,862 --> 00:50:01,172
>> WE JUST BROKE UP, AND WE

2006
00:50:01,172 --> 00:50:03,344
DON'T REALLY TALK ANYMORE.

2007
00:50:03,344 --> 00:50:04,034
>> HOW DID THE BREAKDOWN

2008
00:50:04,034 --> 00:50:04,724
GO DOWN?

2009
00:50:04,724 --> 00:50:05,413
WHAT HAPPENED?

2010
00:50:05,413 --> 00:50:07,103
>> IT FELT LIKE I WAS PUTTING ON

2011
00:50:07,103 --> 00:50:08,241
A SHOW FOR EVERYBODY, 'CAUSE

2012
00:50:08,241 --> 00:50:09,793
EVERYBODY EXPECTED US TO BE

2013
00:50:09,793 --> 00:50:11,689
TOGETHER AND MAKE THIS PERFECT

2014
00:50:11,689 --> 00:50:12,862
FAMILY AND GET MARRIED AND ALL

2015
00:50:12,862 --> 00:50:13,896
THIS STUFF.

2016
00:50:13,896 --> 00:50:15,862
AND THEN ONE DAY IT JUST,

2017
00:50:15,862 --> 00:50:20,137
LIKE...

2018
00:50:20,137 --> 00:50:21,862
WHY AM I CRYING SO MUCH?

2019
00:50:21,862 --> 00:50:23,931
WHY AM I CRYING SO MUCH?
>> I DON'T KNOW.

2020
00:50:23,931 --> 00:50:26,862
>> I DON'T KNOW.

2021
00:50:26,862 --> 00:50:28,379
ONE DAY WHAT HAPPENED?

2022
00:50:28,379 --> 00:50:33,103
>> I JUST REALIZED I DIDN'T,

2023
00:50:33,103 --> 00:50:34,482
LIKE, FEEL FOR HIM WHAT YOU

2024
00:50:34,482 --> 00:50:35,965
SHOULD FEEL FOR SOMEBODY WHEN

2025
00:50:35,965 --> 00:50:38,310
YOU WANT TO SPEND THE REST OF

2026
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:39,275
YOUR LIFE WITH HIM.

2027
00:50:39,275 --> 00:50:41,482
LIKE, I KNEW THAT ONLY REASON I

2028
00:50:41,482 --> 00:50:42,724
WAS WITH HIM WAS BECAUSE OF

2029
00:50:42,724 --> 00:50:44,689
PRESTON, AND THAT WASN'T FAIR TO

2030
00:50:44,689 --> 00:50:45,862
ANY OF US.

2031
00:50:45,862 --> 00:50:48,275
>> HMM.

2032
00:50:48,275 --> 00:50:49,344
YOUR MOM SAID SOMETHING ABOUT

2033
00:50:49,344 --> 00:50:50,758
YOU TWO GOING ON A DIET

2034
00:50:50,758 --> 00:50:51,724
TOGETHER.

2035
00:50:51,724 --> 00:50:54,206
>> WELL, I DON'T--

2036
00:50:54,206 --> 00:50:56,275
I DON'T THINK SHE MEANT ME TO BE

2037
00:50:56,275 --> 00:50:57,344
OFFENDED BY IT.

2038
00:50:57,344 --> 00:50:58,000
>> DID THAT KICK UP YOUR

2039
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,448
SYMPTOMS?

2040
00:51:00,448 --> 00:51:01,482
>> THEY WERE ALREADY PRETTY BAD

2041
00:51:01,482 --> 00:51:02,896
AT THAT POINT, SO...

2042
00:51:02,896 --> 00:51:03,724
>> SO THEY DIDN'T GET WORSE.

2043
00:51:03,724 --> 00:51:04,517
>> MM-MM.

2044
00:51:04,517 --> 00:51:05,482
>> ALL RIGHT, WELL, LET'S TALK

2045
00:51:05,482 --> 00:51:06,551
MORE ABOUT THAT.

2046
00:51:06,551 --> 00:51:07,344
LET'S BRING DEB ON OUT HERE,

2047
00:51:07,344 --> 00:51:08,137
SHALL WE?

2048
00:51:08,137 --> 00:51:09,620
DEB?

2049
00:51:09,620 --> 00:51:14,965
[applause]

2050
00:51:14,965 --> 00:51:16,000
HOW ARE YOU?

2051
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:16,655
>> GOOD.

2052
00:51:16,655 --> 00:51:17,620
>> ARE YOU?

2053
00:51:17,620 --> 00:51:18,689
SO KAYLA'S BEEN TALKING ABOUT

2054
00:51:18,689 --> 00:51:19,724
SOME HEAVY FEELINGS SHE'S

2055
00:51:19,724 --> 00:51:20,517
HAVING.

2056
00:51:20,517 --> 00:51:21,413
DID YOU HEAR ALL THAT?

2057
00:51:21,413 --> 00:51:22,068
>> I DID.

2058
00:51:22,068 --> 00:51:22,931
>> WE SEE HER IN THIS EPISODE

2059
00:51:22,931 --> 00:51:23,862
SAYING THAT SHE FELT ABANDONED

2060
00:51:23,862 --> 00:51:24,517
BY YOU.

2061
00:51:24,517 --> 00:51:25,931
IS SHE JUST OVERREACTING?

2062
00:51:25,931 --> 00:51:27,275
>> I THINK THAT ONCE KAYLA GOT

2063
00:51:27,275 --> 00:51:28,310
PREGNANT, I KIND OF LOOKED AT

2064
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:31,068
HER AS...

2065
00:51:31,068 --> 00:51:32,724
GROWN UP,

2066
00:51:32,724 --> 00:51:33,689
THAT SHE JUST GREW UP REALLY

2067
00:51:33,689 --> 00:51:34,724
FAST.

2068
00:51:34,724 --> 00:51:35,827
AND I THINK THERE WAS JUST A LOT

2069
00:51:35,827 --> 00:51:38,206
THAT I SAW THAT I THOUGHT SHE

2070
00:51:38,206 --> 00:51:40,000
COULD DO ON HER OWN.

2071
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:40,758
>> WHAT DO YOU HAVE TO SAY TO

2072
00:51:40,758 --> 00:51:41,965
THAT?

2073
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:43,862
>> I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND, BUT I

2074
00:51:43,862 --> 00:51:45,344
DON'T THINK THAT WAS THE REASON

2075
00:51:45,344 --> 00:51:47,724
TO, LIKE, RUN AWAY FROM ME.

2076
00:51:47,724 --> 00:51:49,137
LIKE, I DON'T KNOW.

2077
00:51:49,137 --> 00:51:50,965
>> WHAT TOOK PRECEDENT OVER YOU?

2078
00:51:50,965 --> 00:51:52,586
>> HER BOYFRIEND.

2079
00:51:52,586 --> 00:51:53,310
>> IS THAT TRUE?

2080
00:51:53,310 --> 00:51:57,000
>> MAYBE.

2081
00:51:57,000 --> 00:51:58,620
MAYBE.

2082
00:51:58,620 --> 00:51:59,655
>> NOW, WHEN YOU WERE LIVING IN

2083
00:51:59,655 --> 00:52:02,000
YOUR MOM'S HOUSE, WERE YOU LEFT

2084
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,103
TO DEAL WITH THE UTILITIES

2085
00:52:03,103 --> 00:52:04,172
AND FOOD AND ALL THAT KIND OF

2086
00:52:04,172 --> 00:52:04,896
STUFF?

2087
00:52:04,896 --> 00:52:05,517
>> YEP.

2088
00:52:05,517 --> 00:52:06,241
>> HOW DID YOU GUYS DO THAT?

2089
00:52:06,241 --> 00:52:07,793
>> WE SCRAPED TOGETHER.

2090
00:52:07,793 --> 00:52:11,793
LIKE, THERE WERE TIMES WHERE

2091
00:52:11,793 --> 00:52:12,655
SHE WOULDN'T BUY GROCERIES FOR

2092
00:52:12,655 --> 00:52:14,137
MONTHS, AND ME AND MIKE WOULD

2093
00:52:14,137 --> 00:52:15,172
MAKE IT WORK, AND I'D BE,

2094
00:52:15,172 --> 00:52:16,241
LIKE...

2095
00:52:16,241 --> 00:52:17,206
>> HOW ABOUT THE UTILITIES?

2096
00:52:17,206 --> 00:52:19,068
I THOUGHT THERE WAS SOMETHING

2097
00:52:19,068 --> 00:52:20,034
IN THE SHOW ONE NIGHT WHERE YOU

2098
00:52:20,034 --> 00:52:21,724
DIDN'T HAVE HEAT?

2099
00:52:21,724 --> 00:52:22,551
>> UM, WELL, THAT'S WHEN THE

2100
00:52:22,551 --> 00:52:24,482
HEAT WASN'T WORKING, AND MY

2101
00:52:24,482 --> 00:52:26,896
MOM'S JUST LIKE, "WELL, GET A

2102
00:52:26,896 --> 00:52:27,862
HOTEL."

2103
00:52:27,862 --> 00:52:29,586
AND SO 'CAUSE SHE WAS AT HER

2104
00:52:29,586 --> 00:52:30,827
BOYFRIEND'S HOUSE AND SHE DIDN'T

2105
00:52:30,827 --> 00:52:32,241
CARE THAT HEAT WASN'T WORKING.

2106
00:52:32,241 --> 00:52:33,379
>> YOU WERE GOING TO PAY FOR THE

2107
00:52:33,379 --> 00:52:34,310
HOTEL ROOM?

2108
00:52:34,310 --> 00:52:35,586
>> WHAT'S THAT?

2109
00:52:35,586 --> 00:52:36,275
>> I PAID FOR IT.

2110
00:52:36,275 --> 00:52:37,103
>> YOU PAID FOR THE HOTEL ROOM.

2111
00:52:37,103 --> 00:52:37,793
HOW DID YOU AFFORD THAT?

2112
00:52:37,793 --> 00:52:38,965
THAT'S WHAT I'M CONFUSED ABOUT.

2113
00:52:38,965 --> 00:52:40,620
>> SAVINGS.

2114
00:52:40,620 --> 00:52:42,275
>> DEB, WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO

2115
00:52:42,275 --> 00:52:43,137
TELL PEOPLE AT HOME WHO ARE

2116
00:52:43,137 --> 00:52:44,482
SITTING IN JUDGMENT OF YOU

2117
00:52:44,482 --> 00:52:45,689
AND WANT TO KNOW WHY YOU WEREN'T

2118
00:52:45,689 --> 00:52:46,758
THERE, WHY YOU'RE MORE UP WITH

2119
00:52:46,758 --> 00:52:48,448
YOUR BOYFRIEND, WHY KAYLA'S LEFT

2120
00:52:48,448 --> 00:52:50,000
FEELING LIKE THIS?

2121
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:50,689
>> I KNOW I COULD HAVE DONE

2122
00:52:50,689 --> 00:52:52,586
BETTER.

2123
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:54,551
I KNOW I COULD HAVE.

2124
00:52:54,551 --> 00:52:55,379
>> I DIDN'T HEAR YOU APOLOGIZE

2125
00:52:55,379 --> 00:52:56,034
HERE.

2126
00:52:56,034 --> 00:52:57,103
>> MM-HMM.

2127
00:52:57,103 --> 00:52:58,172
>> HAVE YOU BEEN APOLOGIZING

2128
00:52:58,172 --> 00:52:58,862
TO HER?

2129
00:52:58,862 --> 00:53:03,068
>> I HAVE. I'M SORRY.

2130
00:53:03,068 --> 00:53:04,655
>> IT'S OKAY.

2131
00:53:04,655 --> 00:53:05,827
>> BUT SHE REALLY NEEDS YOU.

2132
00:53:05,827 --> 00:53:08,793
>> MM-HMM.

2133
00:53:08,793 --> 00:53:09,827
>> ALL RIGHT, WELL, EATING

2134
00:53:09,827 --> 00:53:11,000
DISORDERS ARE REALLY COMMON

2135
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,172
AMONGST TEENAGE GIRLS,

2136
00:53:12,172 --> 00:53:13,172
OBVIOUSLY, AND THERE IS SUPPORT

2137
00:53:13,172 --> 00:53:14,000
OUT THERE.

PRESTON'S FATHER, MIKE.

2146
00:53:27,482 --> 00:53:29,586
BUT AS WE'RE HEARING, THINGS ARE

2147
00:53:29,586 --> 00:53:30,586
A WHOLE LOT DIFFERENT NOW THAN

2148
00:53:30,586 --> 00:53:31,896
THEY WERE LAST TIME WE SAW THEM.

2149
00:53:31,896 --> 00:53:32,896
WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A BREAK,

2150
00:53:32,896 --> 00:53:34,172
AND THEN MIKE AND KAYLA WILL

00:53:35,413 --> 00:53:36,758
SO DON'T MOVE.

SO DON'T MOVE.

>> WE'RE BACK AT THE 16 AND

2157
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,103
 PREGNANT FINALE SPECIAL.

2158
00:53:55,103 --> 00:53:56,344
I'M YOUR HOST, DR. DREW.

2159
00:53:56,344 --> 00:53:58,689
STILL HERE WITH US, KAYLA,

AND NOW JOINED AS WELL BY HER

00:54:00,103 --> 00:54:02,103
BABY'S FATHER, MIKE.

2162
00:54:02,103 --> 00:54:03,448
NOW, KAYLA, IN MANY OF THESE

2163
00:54:03,448 --> 00:54:04,275
EPISODES WE HEAR ABOUT THE

2164
00:54:04,275 --> 00:54:05,344
BABY'S FATHER BEING A

2165
00:54:05,344 --> 00:54:06,827
SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF STRESS

2166
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:08,000
FOR THESE YOUNG GIRLS.

2167
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,068
FOR YOU, IT SEEMED LIKE

2168
00:54:10,068 --> 00:54:11,965
HE WAS THE GLUE IN YOUR LIFE.

2169
00:54:11,965 --> 00:54:12,724
BUT THAT'S CHANGED.

2170
00:54:12,724 --> 00:54:14,517
>> YEAH.

2171
00:54:14,517 --> 00:54:16,103
I MEAN, AS FAR AS A FATHER GOES,

2172
00:54:16,103 --> 00:54:17,586
HE'S STILL--HE'S AMAZING.

2173
00:54:17,586 --> 00:54:20,517
LIKE, HE, LIKE, SUPPORTS PRESTON

2174
00:54:20,517 --> 00:54:22,000
ENTIRELY, LIKE, AS FAR AS, LIKE,

2175
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,206
FINANCIALLY GOES AND BUYING HIM

2176
00:54:23,206 --> 00:54:25,896
THINGS, AND HE'S ALSO--

2177
00:54:25,896 --> 00:54:27,206
LIKE, HE ADORES HIM.

2178
00:54:27,206 --> 00:54:29,172
LIKE, I FEEL LIKE STATISTICALLY

2179
00:54:29,172 --> 00:54:30,896
HE'S NOT LIKE OTHER TEEN DADS

2180
00:54:30,896 --> 00:54:32,000
AT ALL.

2181
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:33,586
>> IS SHE RIGHT, MIKE?

2182
00:54:33,586 --> 00:54:36,068
>> UM, ACCORDING TO MY FAMILY,

2183
00:54:36,068 --> 00:54:37,482
LIKE, MY PARENTS, THEY SAY

2184
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:39,000
FATHERHOOD SUITS ME.

2185
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,413
>> [laughs]

2186
00:54:40,413 --> 00:54:41,448
>> SO I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S A

2187
00:54:41,448 --> 00:54:42,586
GOOD THING OR A BAD THING,

2188
00:54:42,586 --> 00:54:43,931
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

2189
00:54:43,931 --> 00:54:45,379
I ABSOLUTELY LOVE PRESTON.

2190
00:54:45,379 --> 00:54:46,275
I WOULD DO ANYTHING FOR HIM

2191
00:54:46,275 --> 00:54:47,000
RIGHT NOW.

2192
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:47,724
>> SO YOU'RE COMMITTED.

2193
00:54:47,724 --> 00:54:48,482
>> YES.

2194
00:54:48,482 --> 00:54:49,551
>> HE'S GOT YOU FOR LIFE.

2195
00:54:49,551 --> 00:54:51,000
>> YEP, HE DOES.

2196
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:51,758
>> I UNDERSTAND YOU BROKE UP

2197
00:54:51,758 --> 00:54:52,551
RECENTLY.

2198
00:54:52,551 --> 00:54:53,413
>> MM-HMM.

2199
00:54:53,413 --> 00:54:54,655
>> HOW WAS THAT FOR YOU, MIKE?

2200
00:54:54,655 --> 00:54:56,310
>> WHAT I FEEL HAPPENED IS,

2201
00:54:56,310 --> 00:54:57,896
LIKE, WHEN I STARTED MY NEW JOB,

2202
00:54:57,896 --> 00:55:00,827
I WAS GETTING UP EARLY, GOING TO

2203
00:55:00,827 --> 00:55:01,965
BED EARLY.

2204
00:55:01,965 --> 00:55:02,793
>> SO YOU WEREN'T AVAILABLE.

2205
00:55:02,793 --> 00:55:03,758
>> YEAH.

2206
00:55:03,758 --> 00:55:04,482
>> IS THAT ACCURATE?

2207
00:55:04,482 --> 00:55:06,000
>> YEAH.

2208
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,000
I MEAN, HE WOULD, LIKE, GO TO

2209
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:07,862
BED AND, LIKE, HE WOULDN'T

2210
00:55:07,862 --> 00:55:08,965
SAY GOOD NIGHT.

2211
00:55:08,965 --> 00:55:10,344
AND JUST LITTLE THINGS LIKE THAT

2212
00:55:10,344 --> 00:55:11,965
JUST STARTED GETTING TO ME.

2213
00:55:11,965 --> 00:55:13,241
>> HOW ABOUT WORKING ON THOSE

2214
00:55:13,241 --> 00:55:15,206
THINGS?

2215
00:55:15,206 --> 00:55:16,068
>> WE WERE WORKING ON IT FOR,

2216
00:55:16,068 --> 00:55:17,275
LIKE, THREE YEARS.

2217
00:55:17,275 --> 00:55:19,000
>> DO YOU STILL LOVE HIM?

2218
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,034
>> AS PRESTON'S DAD.

2219
00:55:22,034 --> 00:55:23,000
>> DO YOU LOVE HER?

2220
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,724
>> OF COURSE I DO.

2221
00:55:24,724 --> 00:55:25,482
>> ARE YOU STILL IN LOVE WITH

2222
00:55:25,482 --> 00:55:26,172
HER?

2223
00:55:26,172 --> 00:55:26,896
>> YES.

2224
00:55:26,896 --> 00:55:27,793
>> OH, BOY.

2225
00:55:27,793 --> 00:55:31,103
WHAT DO WE DO WITH THAT?

2226
00:55:31,103 --> 00:55:32,551
>> I DON'T KNOW.

2227
00:55:32,551 --> 00:55:34,310
>> YOU SEEING SOMEONE ELSE?

2228
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:35,344
>> MM.

2229
00:55:35,344 --> 00:55:36,724
>> WHAT HAPPENED TO THE CHEERFUL

2230
00:55:36,724 --> 00:55:38,482
GIRL I MET AND FELL IN LOVE

2231
00:55:38,482 --> 00:55:39,172
WITH?

2232
00:55:39,172 --> 00:55:42,448
>> STOP.

2233
00:55:42,448 --> 00:55:43,689
>> THAT'S HARD TO HEAR?

2234
00:55:43,689 --> 00:55:44,793
>> WELL, JUST, THINGS CAN'T BE

2235
00:55:44,793 --> 00:55:45,724
THE SAME AS THEY WERE WHEN

2236
00:55:45,724 --> 00:55:46,551
I WAS 15.

2237
00:55:46,551 --> 00:55:47,379
LIKE...

2238
00:55:47,379 --> 00:55:48,379
>> FOR SURE.

2239
00:55:48,379 --> 00:55:49,241
>> YEAH, AND YOU HAVE A BABY.

2240
00:55:49,241 --> 00:55:51,034
YOU CAN'T JUST...

2241
00:55:51,034 --> 00:55:52,000
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

2242
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,517
>> CHANGES EVERYTHING.

2243
00:55:53,517 --> 00:55:56,000
>> I JUST THINK IT TOOK HAVING

2244
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,517
PRESTON TO NOTICE THAT, LIKE,

2245
00:55:57,517 --> 00:56:00,000
THIS IS NOT--ALL MY LIFE HAS TO

2246
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:03,344
BE, LIKE--I DON'T HAVE TO BE

2247
00:56:03,344 --> 00:56:04,344
STUCK WITH HIM.

2248
00:56:04,344 --> 00:56:07,310
>> THAT'S HEAVY.

2249
00:56:07,310 --> 00:56:08,620
DO YOU WORRY THAT THIS EATING

2250
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:10,241
DISORDER IS GOING TO HURT KAYLA?

2251
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:12,275
>> YEAH, AND IF PRESTON'S AROUND

2252
00:56:12,275 --> 00:56:14,482
HER WHEN IT'S HAPPENING, I'M

2253
00:56:14,482 --> 00:56:16,000
KIND OF SCARED FOR HIM TOO.

2254
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:16,827
>> WORRIED ABOUT HIS SAFETY,

2255
00:56:16,827 --> 00:56:18,275
IF SHE PASSES OUT OR SOMETHING.

2256
00:56:18,275 --> 00:56:19,931
>> YEAH, IF HE'S, LIKE, ONE YEAR

2257
00:56:19,931 --> 00:56:21,724
OLD, LIKE, WHAT'S A ONE-YEAR-OLD

2258
00:56:21,724 --> 00:56:23,689
GOING TO DO?

2259
00:56:23,689 --> 00:56:27,586
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THAT?

2260
00:56:27,586 --> 00:56:28,689
>> THERE'S NOTHING REALLY TO SAY

2261
00:56:28,689 --> 00:56:29,482
TO THAT.

2262
00:56:29,482 --> 00:56:31,034
IT'S JUST A BIG "WHAT IF?"

2263
00:56:31,034 --> 00:56:32,068
LIKE, THERE'S A MILLION

2264
00:56:32,068 --> 00:56:33,241
"WHAT IF"s WE CAN GO INTO,

2265
00:56:33,241 --> 00:56:34,206
BUT...

2266
00:56:34,206 --> 00:56:35,655
>> WELL, BUT IS IT A JUSTIFIED

2267
00:56:35,655 --> 00:56:36,551
FEAR?

2268
00:56:36,551 --> 00:56:37,862
>> I GUESS SO, YEAH.

2269
00:56:37,862 --> 00:56:39,206
>> OKAY.

2270
00:56:39,206 --> 00:56:41,241
I THINK THAT IF YOU GET HER

2271
00:56:41,241 --> 00:56:42,793
EATING DISORDER ADDRESSED

2272
00:56:42,793 --> 00:56:44,379
AND ASSESSED, I THINK SOME OF

2273
00:56:44,379 --> 00:56:46,000
THIS--ALL THIS AMBIVALENCE AND

2274
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,103
STUFF WILL KIND OF SETTLE DOWN

2275
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:47,896
A LITTLE BIT.

2276
00:56:47,896 --> 00:56:48,620
AT LEAST THERE WILL BE MORE

2277
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:50,000
CLARITY.

2278
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:51,655
>> HOPEFULLY.

2279
00:56:51,655 --> 00:56:52,379
>> 'CAUSE YOU'RE SORT OF

2280
00:56:52,379 --> 00:56:53,448
IN A VORTEX WITH YOUR EATING

2281
00:56:53,448 --> 00:56:54,413
DISORDER, AND THAT'S MAKING

2282
00:56:54,413 --> 00:56:55,206
EVERYTHING VERY CONFUSING,

2283
00:56:55,206 --> 00:56:55,896
ISN'T IT?

2284
00:56:55,896 --> 00:56:56,793
>> MM-HMM.

2285
00:56:56,793 --> 00:56:58,379
>> OKAY, BUT YOU HAVE COMMITTED

2286
00:56:58,379 --> 00:56:59,896
TO ME YOU WILL TALK TO SOMEBODY.

2287
00:56:59,896 --> 00:57:01,655
>> YEAH.

2288
00:57:01,655 --> 00:57:02,931
>> TELL ME WITH LOOKING ME IN

2289
00:57:02,931 --> 00:57:04,034
THE EYE AND TELL ME THAT.

2290
00:57:04,034 --> 00:57:05,586
>> I'LL TALK TO SOMEBODY.

2291
00:57:05,586 --> 00:57:06,275
>> OKAY. VERY GOOD.

2292
00:57:06,275 --> 00:57:07,482
>> PINKY PROMISE.

2293
00:57:07,482 --> 00:57:08,137
>> WHAT'S THAT?

2294
00:57:08,137 --> 00:57:08,965
>> NO.

2295
00:57:08,965 --> 00:57:09,620
>> PINKY PROMISE?

2296
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:10,413
>> SHE'S NEVER GONE BACK ON A

2297
00:57:10,413 --> 00:57:11,103
PINKY PROMISE.

2298
00:57:11,103 --> 00:57:11,862
>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT.

2299
00:57:11,862 --> 00:57:13,482
COME ON. COME ON.

2300
00:57:13,482 --> 00:57:14,344
OKAY?

2301
00:57:14,344 --> 00:57:15,000
>> OKAY.

2302
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:15,793
>> ALL RIGHT, EXCELLENT.

00:57:15,793 --> 00:57:16,931
ALL RIGHT, THANKS YOU GUYS FOR

AND OUR NEXT TEENAGE MOTHER IS

00:57:18,413 --> 00:57:24,068
KIANNA, AND HERE IS HER JOURNEY.

2307
00:57:24,068 --> 00:57:25,793
>> IT'S, LIKE, TWO MONTHS SINCE

2308
00:57:25,793 --> 00:57:27,448
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER, BUT WE'RE

2309
00:57:27,448 --> 00:57:29,103
HAVING A BABY NOW.

2310
00:57:29,103 --> 00:57:29,758
>> TAKE CARE OF THE BABY

2311
00:57:29,758 --> 00:57:31,586
LIKE IT WAS A REAL LIVE BABY.

2312
00:57:31,586 --> 00:57:32,275
>> OKAY.

2313
00:57:32,275 --> 00:57:33,379
>> ROCK HER.

00:57:33,379 --> 00:57:34,724
>> ROCK HER?

2315

>> DO YOU THINK YOU'RE READY

2316
00:57:35,482 --> 00:57:36,655
TO HAVE A REAL BABY?

2317
00:57:36,655 --> 00:57:37,586
>> I DON'T KNOW.

2318
00:57:37,586 --> 00:57:38,655
>> HE JUST THINKS, "OH, IT'S A

2319
00:57:38,655 --> 00:57:39,827
BABY.

2320
00:57:39,827 --> 00:57:41,137
EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE OKAY."

2321
00:57:41,137 --> 00:57:42,000
WE'RE BOTH GOING TO HAVE TO GET

2322
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:42,689
JOBS.

2323
00:57:42,689 --> 00:57:43,482
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO STAY IN

2324
00:57:43,482 --> 00:57:44,379
SCHOOL BECAUSE THE BABY'S GOING

2325
00:57:44,379 --> 00:57:45,448
TO NEED BETTER.

2326
00:57:45,448 --> 00:57:46,862
>> I TOOK STEPS TO PREVENT THIS

2327
00:57:46,862 --> 00:57:48,172
FROM HAPPENING.

2328
00:57:48,172 --> 00:57:49,310
I MEAN, YOU STILL HAVE TIME

2329
00:57:49,310 --> 00:57:50,827
TO THINK ABOUT ADOPTION.

2330
00:57:50,827 --> 00:57:51,724
>> IF THAT'S WHAT YOU CHOOSE TO

2331
00:57:51,724 --> 00:57:52,931
DO, THAT'S WHAT YOU CHOOSE TO

2332
00:57:52,931 --> 00:57:53,862
DO.

2333
00:57:53,862 --> 00:57:54,620
YOU MIGHT GOING TO REGRET IT

2334
00:57:54,620 --> 00:57:56,448
ONE DAY WHEN YOU'RE GROWN.

2335
00:57:56,448 --> 00:57:57,344
I CAN GIVE UP ANYTHING.

2336
00:57:57,344 --> 00:57:58,413
I JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE

2337
00:57:58,413 --> 00:58:00,413
SOMEBODY ELSE RAISE MY SON.

2338
00:58:00,413 --> 00:58:01,344
>> I'M WILLING TO KEEP THE BABY

2339
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:02,413
IF YOU'RE GOING TO SIT HERE AND

HELP ME.

2341
00:58:03,103 --> 00:58:03,793
>> GOOD.

2342

>> THE CONCERN IS, WITH ALL THE

2343
00:58:05,034 --> 00:58:05,931
SWELLING YOU'RE HAVING IN YOUR

00:58:05,931 --> 00:58:07,172
LEGS, PREECLAMPSIA CAN BE

2345
00:58:07,172 --> 00:58:09,000
DANGEROUS FOR YOUR BABY.

AT RISK.

2348
00:58:10,827 --> 00:58:11,827
WE WOULD LIKE TO JUST INDUCE

[baby crying]

2355
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:25,068
>> HOLD ON.

2356
00:58:25,068 --> 00:58:27,103
NO, NO, NO.

2357
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:28,413
>> WHAT'S UP?

2358
00:58:28,413 --> 00:58:29,827
>> I'M TIRED.

2359
00:58:29,827 --> 00:58:30,655
WILL YOUR MAMA BRING YOU OVER

2360
00:58:30,655 --> 00:58:31,689
HERE?

2361
00:58:31,689 --> 00:58:32,344
>> I DOUBT IT.

2362
00:58:32,344 --> 00:58:33,413
SHE DON'T GET HOME TILL LATE.

2363
00:58:33,413 --> 00:58:34,206
>> OKAY.

2364
00:58:34,206 --> 00:58:35,586
I WISH THAT YOU COULD BE THERE

2365
00:58:35,586 --> 00:58:38,310
WITH US 24-7 TOO, LIKE, SO WE

2366
00:58:38,310 --> 00:58:39,379
COULD BE A FAMILY, INSTEAD OF

2367
00:58:39,379 --> 00:58:40,379
JUST BEING A FAMILY JUST ON THE

2368
00:58:40,379 --> 00:58:43,275
WEEKENDS.

2369
00:58:43,275 --> 00:58:44,103

AND HER BABY'S FATHER, ZAK.

2372
00:58:49,275 --> 00:58:51,103
SO, KIANNA, YOU WERE

2373
00:58:51,103 --> 00:58:52,551
CONTEMPLATING CHOOSING ADOPTION,

2374
00:58:52,551 --> 00:58:53,379
IS THAT RIGHT?

2375
00:58:53,379 --> 00:58:54,241
>> YES.

2376
00:58:54,241 --> 00:58:55,448
>> BUT NOBODY ELSE SEEMED TO

2377
00:58:55,448 --> 00:58:58,000
THINK THAT WAS A GREAT IDEA.

2378
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,482
>> HE DIDN'T LIKE THE IDEA OF

2379
00:58:59,482 --> 00:59:01,275
NOT RAISING HIS OWN SON.

2380
00:59:01,275 --> 00:59:02,034
>> ZAK DIDN'T LIKE THAT.

00:59:02,034 --> 00:59:02,724
>> NO.

00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:05,793
>> SHE WOULD GO EITHER WAY

2384
00:59:05,793 --> 00:59:06,620
AND SUPPORT ME.

2385
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:08,517
>> SO YOU WERE IN FAVOR OF

2386
00:59:08,517 --> 00:59:10,000
ADOPTION, MOM?

2387
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:11,862
>> I WAS IN FAVOR OF ADOPTION,

2388
00:59:11,862 --> 00:59:12,931
BUT MORE IN FAVOR OF HER KEEPING

2389
00:59:12,931 --> 00:59:14,482
THE BABY.

2390
00:59:14,482 --> 00:59:15,379
>> WHAT STEPS DID YOU TAKE TO

2391
00:59:15,379 --> 00:59:16,931
PREVENT THIS, MOM?

2392
00:59:16,931 --> 00:59:17,896
>> WELL, WITH ME BEING A TEEN

2393
00:59:17,896 --> 00:59:19,275
MOM, OF COURSE, WHEN SHE CAME OF

AGE, I KNEW WHAT WAS GOING TO

2395
00:59:20,413 --> 00:59:21,068
HAPPEN.

2396
00:59:21,068 --> 00:59:22,000
TEENAGERS ARE TEENAGERS.

2397
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:23,862
SO I PUT HER ON BIRTH CONTROL.

2398
00:59:23,862 --> 00:59:24,931
AND SO, I MEAN, THE ONLY THING I

2399
00:59:24,931 --> 00:59:26,000
EXPECTED FOR HER TO DO WAS TO

2400
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:27,482
TAKE THE BIRTH CONTROL, AND AS

2401
00:59:27,482 --> 00:59:28,586
YOU CAN SEE, THAT DID NOT

2402
00:59:28,586 --> 00:59:29,517
HAPPEN.

2403
00:59:29,517 --> 00:59:30,931
>> SO NOW YOU'VE COMMITTED

2404
00:59:30,931 --> 00:59:32,758
TO PARENTING, AND ARE YOU

2405
00:59:32,758 --> 00:59:33,689
COMMITTED TO KIANNA?

2406
00:59:33,689 --> 00:59:35,793
>> YES.

2407
00:59:35,793 --> 00:59:36,758
>> FOR LIFE.

2408
00:59:36,758 --> 00:59:37,413
>> YEP.

2409
00:59:37,413 --> 00:59:38,172
>> YOU'RE GOING TO DO IT THE

2410
00:59:38,172 --> 00:59:38,862
HARD WAY.

2411
00:59:38,862 --> 00:59:39,827
>> THERE'S A RING RIGHT THERE.

2412
00:59:39,827 --> 00:59:41,310
>> OH, WHAT'S THAT NOW?

2413
00:59:41,310 --> 00:59:42,103
>> A RING.

2414
00:59:42,103 --> 00:59:43,000
>> THAT'S NICE.

2415
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:44,275
SO THAT'S HOW YOUR RELATIONSHIP

2416
00:59:44,275 --> 00:59:45,862
HAS MOVED ALONG.

2417
00:59:45,862 --> 00:59:46,758
AND HOW DOES THAT FEEL?

2418
00:59:46,758 --> 00:59:47,655
>> IT MADE ME FEEL LIKE HE WAS

2419
00:59:47,655 --> 00:59:50,172
FOR REAL ABOUT US, AND HE WASN'T

2420
00:59:50,172 --> 00:59:51,068
GOING TO LEAVE ME.

2421
00:59:51,068 --> 00:59:53,413
>> OKAY.

2422
00:59:53,413 --> 00:59:54,137
SO ZAK'S BEEN A PRETTY GOOD

2423
00:59:54,137 --> 00:59:54,827
PARTNER.

2424
00:59:54,827 --> 00:59:55,793
>> MM-HMM.

2425
00:59:55,793 --> 00:59:57,103
>> ZAK, YOU'RE COMMITTED FOR

2426
00:59:57,103 --> 00:59:57,896
LIFE HERE.

2427
00:59:57,896 --> 00:59:58,931
YOU'RE ALL THE WAY IN.

2428
00:59:58,931 --> 01:00:00,137
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

2429
01:00:00,137 --> 01:00:01,551
>> 16.

2430
01:00:01,551 --> 01:00:02,379
>> ARE YOU HAVING TROUBLE WITH

2431
01:00:02,379 --> 01:00:03,206
THAT?

2432
01:00:03,206 --> 01:00:04,931
STAYING COMMITTED?

2433
01:00:04,931 --> 01:00:06,482
>> I DON'T THINK SO.

2434
01:00:06,482 --> 01:00:08,103
>> YOU HAD SAID, ZAK, THAT YOU

2435
01:00:08,103 --> 01:00:09,275
DO WANT YOUR CHILD TO HAVE MORE

2436
01:00:09,275 --> 01:00:10,241
THAN THE FIVE MEMORIES THAT YOU

2437
01:00:10,241 --> 01:00:11,413
HAVE OF YOUR DAD.

2438
01:00:11,413 --> 01:00:12,413
YOU ONLY FIVE MEMORIES OF HIM.

2439
01:00:12,413 --> 01:00:13,482
>> YEP.

2440
01:00:13,482 --> 01:00:14,620
>> WERE THEY GOOD?

2441
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:17,448
BAD.

2442
01:00:17,448 --> 01:00:18,448
YEAH, IT'S VERY EMOTIONAL FOR

2443
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:22,000
YOU.

2444
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,000
WHAT STEPS, ZAK, DO YOU THINK

2445
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,068
YOU'RE TAKING TO MAKE SURE THAT

2446
01:00:25,068 --> 01:00:27,000
YOUR BABY DOESN'T LIVE THE SAME

2447
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:27,689
LIFE YOU DID?

2448
01:00:27,689 --> 01:00:28,896
>> THE RING.

2449
01:00:28,896 --> 01:00:29,862
THE RING.

2450
01:00:29,862 --> 01:00:32,344
>> THAT'S GOING TO KEEP YOU IN?

2451
01:00:32,344 --> 01:00:33,482
YEAH.

2452
01:00:33,482 --> 01:00:34,965
KIANNA?

2453
01:00:34,965 --> 01:00:36,206
YOU ALL IN WITH HIM?

2454
01:00:36,206 --> 01:00:37,103
>> MM-HMM.

2455
01:00:37,103 --> 01:00:37,965
>> DO YOU TRUST HER ALL THE WAY,

2456
01:00:37,965 --> 01:00:39,275
ZAK?

2457
01:00:39,275 --> 01:00:40,206
>> STARTING TO.

2458
01:00:40,206 --> 01:00:41,172
>> STARTING TO.

2459
01:00:41,172 --> 01:00:42,379
WHY WERE YOU NOT TRUSTWORTHY?

2460
01:00:42,379 --> 01:00:43,655
>> DIDN'T TRUST NOBODY, REALLY.

2461
01:00:43,655 --> 01:00:44,620
>> DIDN'T TRUST ANYBODY.

2462
01:00:44,620 --> 01:00:45,551
>> AFTER MY DAD.

2463
01:00:45,551 --> 01:00:46,758
>> OH.

2464
01:00:46,758 --> 01:00:48,448
THAT'S VERY COURAGEOUS OF YOU,

2465
01:00:48,448 --> 01:00:50,517
BY THE WAY, TO RISK A REAL

2466
01:00:50,517 --> 01:00:51,379
ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP WITH

2467
01:00:51,379 --> 01:00:52,758
TRUST.

2468

DOES SHE REGRET THAT DECISION,

2496
01:01:36,862 --> 01:01:38,586

AND HERE IS A VERY SOBERING

2506
01:02:02,310 --> 01:02:03,068

WHERE DOES IT STAND TODAY?

01:02:35,344 --> 01:02:36,413
I HAVE TO, LIKE, MAKE UP SOME

2531
01:02:36,413 --> 01:02:37,275

THINK THAT I'M JUST, LIKE, BEING

2533
01:02:38,413 --> 01:02:39,103

2534
01:02:39,103 --> 01:02:40,137
I AM GOING TO LEAVE TO GO ON

I WILL TOTALLY TRY TO BE THERE.

2537
01:02:43,344 --> 01:02:44,344

EVEN ANSWERED.

2544
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,448
I'VE KNOWN HER SINCE, LIKE, I

2545
01:02:54,448 --> 01:02:56,965
WAS SIX, AND NOW SHE DOESN'T

2546
01:02:56,965 --> 01:02:59,000
WAS SIX, AND NOW SHE DOESN'T
TALK TO ME.

2547
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:02,068

2549
01:03:02,965 --> 01:03:04,000
COLLEGE?

2550
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:05,344

>> YEAH, I'M NOT SO WORRIED

2562
01:03:25,379 --> 01:03:26,793
ABOUT SEEING THE PEOPLE.

2563
01:03:26,793 --> 01:03:27,862
I'M MORE NERVOUS ABOUT LEAVING

2564
01:03:27,862 --> 01:03:29,310
ENRIQUE.

2565
01:03:29,310 --> 01:03:31,000

IT MEANS A LOT.

2573
01:03:39,379 --> 01:03:40,586
I DON'T KNOW THAT I WANT YOU TO

2574
01:03:40,586 --> 01:03:42,413
BE WITH MY DAUGHTER.

2575
01:03:42,413 --> 01:03:43,827

GIVEN HIM ENOUGH OPPORTUNITIES

2578
01:03:46,758 --> 01:03:50,103

01:03:51,413 --> 01:03:52,655
WE LEFT OFF, IZABELLA, YOUR

2581
01:03:52,655 --> 01:03:53,896
RELATIONSHIP WAS ON SHAKY

2582
01:03:53,896 --> 01:03:55,827
GROUNDS WITH JAIRO.

2583
01:03:55,827 --> 01:03:57,827
WHERE ARE WE NOW?

2584
01:03:57,827 --> 01:03:58,931
>> UM, LIKE, TEN TIMES BETTER.

2585
01:03:58,931 --> 01:04:00,655
>> HOW COME?

2586
01:04:00,655 --> 01:04:01,724
DID YOU GO TO SCHOOL?

2587
01:04:01,724 --> 01:04:02,896
>> YEAH, I STEPPED UP AND GOT

2588
01:04:02,896 --> 01:04:05,068
A JOB AND STARTED GOING TO

2589
01:04:05,068 --> 01:04:05,862
SCHOOL.

2590
01:04:05,862 --> 01:04:07,000
>> JOB AND SCHOOL?

2591
01:04:07,000 --> 01:04:07,793
>> YEAH.

2592
01:04:07,793 --> 01:04:09,000
>> AND DID IZABELLA'S DAD GET A

2593
01:04:09,000 --> 01:04:10,344
LITTLE COOLER AFTER THAT?

2594
01:04:10,344 --> 01:04:11,689
>> YEAH, WAY COOLER.

2595
01:04:11,689 --> 01:04:12,758
>> WAY COOLER?

2596
01:04:12,758 --> 01:04:14,965
IZABELLA, HIDING IT MUST HAVE

2597
01:04:14,965 --> 01:04:16,724
BEEN EXCRUCIATING.

2598
01:04:16,724 --> 01:04:17,724
>> YEAH.

2599
01:04:17,724 --> 01:04:18,551
>> OR WERE YOU IN SO MUCH

2600
01:04:18,551 --> 01:04:19,896
DENIAL, YOU DIDN'T WANT TO EVEN

2601
01:04:19,896 --> 01:04:20,689
BELIEVE IT YOURSELF?

2602
01:04:20,689 --> 01:04:21,965
>> UM, AT FIRST, I THINK IT

2603
01:04:21,965 --> 01:04:22,896
STARTED OUT THAT WAY

2604
01:04:22,896 --> 01:04:24,655
AT THE VERY BEGINNING,

2605
01:04:24,655 --> 01:04:26,965
AND THEN ONCE I JUST KEPT GOING

2606
01:04:26,965 --> 01:04:28,000
ON WITH IT AND NOT TELLING

2607
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:30,310
ANYONE, IT JUST WAS HARDER TO

2608
01:04:30,310 --> 01:04:31,724
TELL THEM.

2609
01:04:31,724 --> 01:04:32,586
>> HOW DID PEOPLE REACT WHEN YOU

2610
01:04:32,586 --> 01:04:33,448
TOLD THEM?

2611
01:04:33,448 --> 01:04:35,551
>> UM, THEY WERE REALLY HURT,

2612
01:04:35,551 --> 01:04:36,379
I THINK.

2613
01:04:36,379 --> 01:04:37,931
>> AND DISAPPOINTED?

2614
01:04:37,931 --> 01:04:40,000
>> YEAH.

2615
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,827
>> IS THAT HARD FOR YOU?

2616
01:04:41,827 --> 01:04:43,827
>> YEAH.

2617
01:04:43,827 --> 01:04:45,827
>> HOW'D YOU GET THROUGH THAT?

2618
01:04:45,827 --> 01:04:47,379
>> UM, WELL, 'CAUSE I HAVE

2619
01:04:47,379 --> 01:04:48,896
REALLY GOOD SUPPORT WITH MY

2620
01:04:48,896 --> 01:04:51,275
PARENTS AND JAIRO.

2621
01:04:51,275 --> 01:04:53,448
>> YOU SEEM VERY SAD ABOUT IT.

2622
01:04:53,448 --> 01:04:54,275
>> IT'S JUST HARD TO TALK

2623
01:04:54,275 --> 01:04:55,000
ABOUT T.

2624
01:04:55,000 --> 01:04:55,827
>> ABOUT DISAPPOINTING YOUR

2625
01:04:55,827 --> 01:04:58,896
>> ABOUT DISAPPOINTING YOUR
PARENTS?

2626
01:04:58,896 --> 01:05:02,413
PARENTS?

2627
01:05:02,413 --> 01:05:03,517
DID YOU TALK TO YOUR PARENTS

2628
01:05:03,517 --> 01:05:05,689
ABOUT SEX AND BIRTH CONTROL?

2629
01:05:05,689 --> 01:05:07,000
>> YEAH.

2630
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:08,137
IT WAS JUST AN ACCIDENT,

2631
01:05:08,137 --> 01:05:09,896
OBVIOUSLY.

2632
01:05:09,896 --> 01:05:10,551
>> WERE YOU TAKING ANY

2633
01:05:10,551 --> 01:05:11,551
PRECAUTION?

2634
01:05:11,551 --> 01:05:12,206
>> YEAH.

2635
01:05:12,206 --> 01:05:14,379
WE WERE USING CONDOMS.

2636
01:05:14,379 --> 01:05:15,103
>> AND IT BROKE.

2637
01:05:15,103 --> 01:05:16,413
>> BROKE.

2638
01:05:16,413 --> 01:05:17,689
>> AND THEN RIGHT AFTER, I TOOK

2639
01:05:17,689 --> 01:05:19,034
THE MORNING AFTER PILL.

2640
01:05:19,034 --> 01:05:19,896
>> UH-HUH.

2641
01:05:19,896 --> 01:05:20,862
>> LIKE, THE NEXT MORNING.

2642
01:05:20,862 --> 01:05:21,517
>> GOOD.

2643
01:05:21,517 --> 01:05:24,000
>> AND IT DIDN'T WORK.

2644
01:05:24,000 --> 01:05:24,827
>> LET'S THINK ABOUT MORNING

2645
01:05:24,827 --> 01:05:25,482
AFTER PILLS.

2646
01:05:25,482 --> 01:05:26,586
IF YOU'RE ALREADY PREGNANT,

2647
01:05:26,586 --> 01:05:27,758
YOU'RE GOING TO STAY PREGNANT.

2648
01:05:27,758 --> 01:05:28,862
YOU KNOW.

2649
01:05:28,862 --> 01:05:30,379
SO YOU MUST HAVE JUST OVULATED.

2650
01:05:30,379 --> 01:05:31,172
>> MM-HMM.

2651
01:05:31,172 --> 01:05:32,206
THAT'S WHAT THE DOCTOR SAID.

2652
01:05:32,206 --> 01:05:34,172
IT WAS, LIKE, RIGHT ON.

2653
01:05:34,172 --> 01:05:35,310
>> WHAT ROLE DO YOUR PARENTS

2654
01:05:35,310 --> 01:05:36,137
PLAY IN ALL THIS?

2655
01:05:36,137 --> 01:05:37,724
>> THEY HELP BOTH OF US SO MUCH,

2656
01:05:37,724 --> 01:05:38,448
I THINK.

2657
01:05:38,448 --> 01:05:39,206
>> SO YOU'RE REALLY LUCKY TO

2658
01:05:39,206 --> 01:05:39,896
HAVE THEM.

2659
01:05:39,896 --> 01:05:40,758
THAT'S HOW YOU'RE ABLE TO GO TO

2660
01:05:40,758 --> 01:05:41,413
SCHOOL, I IMAGINE.

2661
01:05:41,413 --> 01:05:42,172
>> I COULDN'T DO ANY OF IT

2662
01:05:42,172 --> 01:05:43,517
WITHOUT THEM.

2663
01:05:43,517 --> 01:05:44,724
>> WELL, LET'S BRING IZABELLA'S

2664
01:05:44,724 --> 01:05:46,724
PARENTS UP HERE, ERIC AND VI.

2665
01:05:46,724 --> 01:05:47,793
COME ON IN, GUYS.

2666
01:05:47,793 --> 01:05:52,758
COME ON IN, GUYS.
[applause]

2667
01:05:52,758 --> 01:05:55,103
[applause]

2668
01:05:55,103 --> 01:05:56,551
WELCOME, GUYS.

2669
01:05:56,551 --> 01:05:57,896
I WANT TO SORT OF PICK UP WHERE

2670
01:05:57,896 --> 01:05:59,827
WE WERE HERE.

2671
01:05:59,827 --> 01:06:01,793
HOW HAS THIS BEEN FOR YOU?

2672
01:06:01,793 --> 01:06:03,413
>> SHE'S MY BABY, YOU KNOW.

2673
01:06:03,413 --> 01:06:04,551
YOU NEVER EXPECT THAT

2674
01:06:04,551 --> 01:06:06,034
TO HAPPEN TO YOU.

2675
01:06:06,034 --> 01:06:07,655
I MEAN, YOU THINK YOU'VE TALKED

2676
01:06:07,655 --> 01:06:10,758
TO YOUR KIDS ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

2677
01:06:10,758 --> 01:06:11,793
SEX AND ALL THOSE THINGS,

2678
01:06:11,793 --> 01:06:14,517
PROTECTION, AND THEN THIS COMES

2679
01:06:14,517 --> 01:06:16,758
UP, AND, I MEAN, IT'S

2680
01:06:16,758 --> 01:06:17,655
OVERWHELMING.

2681
01:06:17,655 --> 01:06:18,448
>> YEAH, IT'S OVERWHELMING.

2682
01:06:18,448 --> 01:06:20,034
>> YOU KNOW, BUT IT HAPPENS.

2683
01:06:20,034 --> 01:06:21,103
IT'S REALITY.

2684
01:06:21,103 --> 01:06:22,000
>> VI, WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS

2685
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,793
ON THE RELATIONSHIP WITH JAIRO?

2686
01:06:23,793 --> 01:06:25,448
>> THEY'VE GOTTEN A LOT BETTER.

2687
01:06:25,448 --> 01:06:26,310
>> WHAT WAS THE PROBLEM?

2688
01:06:26,310 --> 01:06:27,482
>> HE'S A TEENAGER STILL,

2689
01:06:27,482 --> 01:06:28,758
AND, YOU KNOW, HE STILL WANTED

2690
01:06:28,758 --> 01:06:30,310
TO GO FUN WITH HIS FRIENDS.

2691
01:06:30,310 --> 01:06:31,241
AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK HE'S

2692
01:06:31,241 --> 01:06:33,724
BECOME REALLY RESPONSIBLE.

2693
01:06:33,724 --> 01:06:34,689
>> ERIC, WHEN YOU FOUND OUT HE

2694
01:06:34,689 --> 01:06:35,344
HAD BEEN LYING ABOUT HIS

2695
01:06:35,344 --> 01:06:36,206
EDUCATION, HOW'D YOU GET

2696
01:06:36,206 --> 01:06:37,068
THROUGH THAT?

2697
01:06:37,068 --> 01:06:38,344
>> I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED,

2698
01:06:38,344 --> 01:06:39,482
BECAUSE I BELIEVED HIM.

2699
01:06:39,482 --> 01:06:41,034
I MEAN, I BELIEVED HIM.

2700
01:06:41,034 --> 01:06:42,862
BUT I THINK HE DID STEP UP

2701
01:06:42,862 --> 01:06:44,379
TO THE PLATE WHEN HE CAME TO US

2702
01:06:44,379 --> 01:06:46,586
AND SAID, "I HAD BEEN LYING."

2703
01:06:46,586 --> 01:06:49,689
AND THE ONLY THING WE ASKED OF

2704
01:06:49,689 --> 01:06:52,034
HIM IS, "WELL, OKAY, FINE.

2705
01:06:52,034 --> 01:06:53,482
YOU LIED.

2706
01:06:53,482 --> 01:06:55,413
PLEASE CHANGE IT AND DON'T LIE

2707
01:06:55,413 --> 01:06:56,344
TO US ANYMORE."

2708
01:06:56,344 --> 01:06:57,206
>> DID HE CHANGE IT?

2709
01:06:57,206 --> 01:06:57,965
>> HE DID.

2710
01:06:57,965 --> 01:06:59,034
HE ACTUALLY DID.

2711
01:06:59,034 --> 01:07:00,000
>> JAIRO, ARE YOU GOING TO BE

2712
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:00,965
AROUND FOR THE LONG HAUL?

2713
01:07:00,965 --> 01:07:01,655
>> YEAH.

2714
01:07:01,655 --> 01:07:02,586
>> HOW DO WE KNOW THAT?

2715
01:07:02,586 --> 01:07:03,724
>> WE'RE ENGAGED.

2716
01:07:03,724 --> 01:07:04,551
>> YOU'RE ENGAGED.

2717
01:07:04,551 --> 01:07:05,275
OH, MY GOODNESS.

2718
01:07:05,275 --> 01:07:06,103
CAN I SEE THE RING?

2719
01:07:06,103 --> 01:07:07,517
OH, VERY NICE. LOVELY.

2720
01:07:07,517 --> 01:07:08,172
>> THANKS.

2721
01:07:08,172 --> 01:07:08,862
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

2722
01:07:08,862 --> 01:07:10,172
>> both: THANKS.

2723
01:07:10,172 --> 01:07:11,137
>> WELL, THANK YOU GUYS FOR

2724
01:07:11,137 --> 01:07:11,931
BEING HERE.

2725
01:07:11,931 --> 01:07:13,310
I MEAN, WELL DONE, MOM AND DAD.

2726
01:07:13,310 --> 01:07:14,620
I MEAN, IT'S--THEY'RE GREAT

2727
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:15,310
KIDS.

2728
01:07:15,310 --> 01:07:16,344
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

2729
01:07:16,344 --> 01:07:17,344
>> THIS JUST SENT THEM OFF THE

2730
01:07:17,344 --> 01:07:18,241
RAIL QUITE A BIT.

2731
01:07:18,241 --> 01:07:19,793
>> MM-HMM, YEAH.

2732
01:07:19,793 --> 01:07:20,586
>> ALL RIGHT, WELL, STICK

2733
01:07:20,586 --> 01:07:21,482
AROUND, AND WE'RE GOING TO CHECK

2734
01:07:21,482 --> 01:07:22,310
BACK WITH YOU GUYS A LITTLE BIT

2735
01:07:22,310 --> 01:07:23,000
LATER.

2736
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:23,827
BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE GOING TO

2737
01:07:23,827 --> 01:07:25,517
REVISIT ANOTHER 16 AND PREGNANT

2738
01:07:25,517 --> 01:07:26,310
STORY.

2739
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:28,137
THIS IS ALLIE AND HER PATH TO

2740
01:07:28,137 --> 01:07:32,275
WHERE SHE IS TODAY.

2741
01:07:32,275 --> 01:07:33,896
>> LIKE, I CAN'T GO TO MY MOM'S.

2742
01:07:33,896 --> 01:07:35,172
IF I COULD GO TO MY MOM'S HOUSE,

2743
01:07:35,172 --> 01:07:36,068
THEN ME AND JOEY ARE NOT

2744
01:07:36,068 --> 01:07:37,034
TOGETHER.

2745
01:07:37,034 --> 01:07:38,827
I KNOW IT'S YOUR MOM, BUT I

2746
01:07:38,827 --> 01:07:39,896
DON'T WANT TO BE HERE.

2747
01:07:39,896 --> 01:07:40,896
>> DRUGS HAVE REALLY JUST MESSED

2748
01:07:40,896 --> 01:07:41,758
UP HER MIND.

2749
01:07:41,758 --> 01:07:42,413
>> SO WHAT?

2750
01:07:42,413 --> 01:07:43,103
I'M A DOPE FIEND, BITCH.

2751
01:07:43,103 --> 01:07:44,000
WHAT?

2752
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:44,896
I WANT HER OUT.

2753
01:07:44,896 --> 01:07:45,931
YOU ARE NOT TO STEP FOOT IN MY

2754
01:07:45,931 --> 01:07:47,896
[bleep] HOUSE.

2755
01:07:47,896 --> 01:07:49,379
YOU BITCH!

2756
01:07:49,379 --> 01:07:50,103
>> I'M NOT EVEN GOING TO

2757
01:07:50,103 --> 01:07:51,000
GRADUATE IF WE STAY OVER THERE.

2758
01:07:51,000 --> 01:07:51,931
>> GET YOUR [bleep] ASS OUT OF

2759
01:07:51,931 --> 01:07:52,793
MY [bleep] HOUSE.

2760
01:07:52,793 --> 01:07:54,413
>> ALLISON, YOU CAN COME HOME.

2761
01:07:54,413 --> 01:07:55,413
BUT LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,

2762
01:07:55,413 --> 01:07:56,620
YOUR LIFE WILL DRASTICALLY TURN

2763
01:07:56,620 --> 01:07:57,620
AROUND.

2764
01:07:57,620 --> 01:07:59,137
>> [crying]

2765
01:07:59,137 --> 01:08:00,620
>> JOEY, GIVE HER YOUR HAND.

2766
01:08:00,620 --> 01:08:01,517
>> I DON'T WANT TO DO ANYTHING

2767
01:08:01,517 --> 01:08:02,931
THAT WILL MAKE HER AGGRAVATED.

2768
01:08:02,931 --> 01:08:05,034
>> PUSH, PUSH, PUSH, PUSH, PUSH.

2769
01:08:05,034 --> 01:08:07,827
>> OH, MY GOD.

2770
01:08:07,827 --> 01:08:09,034
D.>> I'LL GET HIM.

2771
01:08:09,034 --> 01:08:09,965
I DON'T KNOW WHY I EVEN ASKED.

2772
01:08:09,965 --> 01:08:10,827
YOU DON'T HELP.

2773
01:08:10,827 --> 01:08:11,793
HE'S BEEN PISSING ME OFF LATELY

2774
01:08:11,793 --> 01:08:13,241
'CAUSE HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING.

2775
01:08:13,241 --> 01:08:14,172
HE'S NOT READY FOR THE

2776
01:08:14,172 --> 01:08:15,137
RESPONSIBILITY, AND IT'S A

2777
01:08:15,137 --> 01:08:17,068
LITTLE LATE TO NOT BE READY.

2778
01:08:17,068 --> 01:08:17,931
>> I SAID HE SMELLED, LIKE, A

2779
01:08:17,931 --> 01:08:18,620
WHILE AGO.

2780
01:08:18,620 --> 01:08:19,413
>> THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU CHANGE

2781
01:08:19,413 --> 01:08:20,068
HIM A WHILE AGO?

2782
01:08:20,068 --> 01:08:20,965
>> YEAH?

2783
01:08:20,965 --> 01:08:22,000
>> WOULD YOU BE WITH HIM NOW IF

2784
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,689
IT WASN'T FOR HIM?

2785
01:08:23,689 --> 01:08:24,862
>> I DON'T KNOW.

2786
01:08:24,862 --> 01:08:26,137
>> YOU'RE FRIGGIN' UNGRATEFUL.

2787
01:08:26,137 --> 01:08:27,379
>> I CAN'T TAKE THIS ANYMORE.

2788
01:08:27,379 --> 01:08:28,275
IT'S DONE.

2789
01:08:28,275 --> 01:08:29,206
>> WHEN DID WE BECOME SO BROKEN?

2790
01:08:29,206 --> 01:08:30,103
>> WHEN YOU STOPPED TAKING CARE

2791
01:08:30,103 --> 01:08:30,793
OF AYDENN.

2792
01:08:30,793 --> 01:08:31,551
>> 'CAUSE OF THAT?

2793
01:08:31,551 --> 01:08:32,413
>> YEAH.

2794
01:08:32,413 --> 01:08:34,482
>> YEAH.
>> [crying]

2795
01:08:34,482 --> 01:08:37,000
>> [crying]

2796
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:38,000
>> WELL, ALLIE, YOU SPECIFICALLY

2797
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,413
STAYED IN TEXAS SO YOU AND JOEY

2798
01:08:40,413 --> 01:08:41,517
COULD PARENT TOGETHER, RIGHT?

2799
01:08:41,517 --> 01:08:42,379
>> YES.

2800
01:08:42,379 --> 01:08:44,068
>> HOW'D THAT WORK OUT?

2801
01:08:44,068 --> 01:08:44,862
>> WE WERE BOTH NEW PARENTS,

2802
01:08:44,862 --> 01:08:46,103
SO IT WAS JUST ASSUMING, LIKE,

2803
01:08:46,103 --> 01:08:47,517
HE WASN'T READY OR WHATEVER,

2804
01:08:47,517 --> 01:08:49,000
SO I GAVE IT A COUPLE MONTHS--

2805
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,758
WELL, LIKE, TWO--THEN HE STILL

2806
01:08:50,758 --> 01:08:51,758
WASN'T HELPING, AND I WAS

2807
01:08:51,758 --> 01:08:52,758
GETTING, LIKE, MAD.

2808
01:08:52,758 --> 01:08:55,965
LIKE, "WHY AREN'T YOU HELPING?"

2809
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:56,896
>> A LOT OF THE DRAMA WE SAW ON

2810
01:08:56,896 --> 01:08:59,103
YOUR EPISODE INVOLVED RELATION

2811
01:08:59,103 --> 01:09:00,586
BETWEEN YOU AND JOEY'S MOM.

2812
01:09:00,586 --> 01:09:01,482
>> MM-HMM.

2813
01:09:01,482 --> 01:09:02,655
>> FIRST OF ALL, WHAT DO YOU

2814
01:09:02,655 --> 01:09:03,379
WANT TO TELL US ABOUT THAT

2815
01:09:03,379 --> 01:09:04,413
RELATIONSHIP?

2816
01:09:04,413 --> 01:09:06,448
>> WELL, I KNEW FROM THE START,

2817
01:09:06,448 --> 01:09:08,103
WHEN I MET HER, I COULD TELL SHE

2818
01:09:08,103 --> 01:09:09,344
WAS A LITTLE UNEASY ABOUT ME

2819
01:09:09,344 --> 01:09:10,448
BECAUSE I WAS THE FIRST GIRL

2820
01:09:10,448 --> 01:09:11,344
HE BROUGHT AROUND.

2821
01:09:11,344 --> 01:09:12,103
>> "UNEASY" IS AN

2822
01:09:12,103 --> 01:09:12,931
UNDERSTATEMENT.

2823
01:09:12,931 --> 01:09:14,000
IT GOT BAD.

2824
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:14,862
>> YEAH.

2825
01:09:14,862 --> 01:09:15,896
>> SHE WAS ABUSIVE TOWARDS YOU.

2826
01:09:15,896 --> 01:09:16,758
>> YEAH.

2827
01:09:16,758 --> 01:09:18,448
>> HOW DID THAT AFFECT YOU?

2828
01:09:18,448 --> 01:09:19,827
>> THAT MADE ME WANT TO LEAVE.

2829
01:09:19,827 --> 01:09:20,758
THERE WAS SO MANY TIMES I WANTED

2830
01:09:20,758 --> 01:09:21,413
TO LEAVE.

2831
01:09:21,413 --> 01:09:22,413
>> WHY DIDN'T YOU?

2832
01:09:22,413 --> 01:09:24,793
>> FOR JOEY.

2833
01:09:24,793 --> 01:09:26,586
I STAYED FOR HIM.

2834
01:09:26,586 --> 01:09:27,482
>> YOU SAID THAT JOEY WASN'T

2835
01:09:27,482 --> 01:09:29,413
READY TO BE A DAD.

2836
01:09:29,413 --> 01:09:30,206
HOW ABOUT YOU?

2837
01:09:30,206 --> 01:09:31,034
WERE YOU READY?

2838
01:09:31,034 --> 01:09:31,758
>> I WASN'T READY.

2839
01:09:31,758 --> 01:09:33,206
WE WERE BOTH NOT READY FOR THIS.

2840
01:09:33,206 --> 01:09:34,620
BUT I THINK THE ONLY DIFFERENCE

2841
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:37,586
IS, I MEAN, I'M NOT SUPER

2842
01:09:37,586 --> 01:09:39,068
MATURE, BUT, I MEAN, LIKE, I

2843
01:09:39,068 --> 01:09:40,275
MATURED UP FOR AYDENN AND HE

2844
01:09:40,275 --> 01:09:41,000
DIDN'T.

2845
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
THAT'S WHAT MADE ME MAD, AND

2846
01:09:42,000 --> 01:09:44,206
THAT'S WHY I BROKE UP WITH HIM.

2847
01:09:44,206 --> 01:09:44,965
>> YOU'RE STILL IN SCHOOL.

2848
01:09:44,965 --> 01:09:45,620
>> YES.

2849
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:46,551
I HAVE ALL "A"s.

2850
01:09:46,551 --> 01:09:48,000
>> GOOD. CONGRATULATIONS.

2851
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:49,413
>> THANK YOU.

2852
01:09:49,413 --> 01:09:50,241
>> ARE YOU GOING TO GRADUATE?

2853
01:09:50,241 --> 01:09:51,379
>> YES, I AM. IN TWO MONTHS.

2854
01:09:51,379 --> 01:09:52,034
>> TWO MONTHS.

2855
01:09:52,034 --> 01:09:52,724
AND THEN WHAT?

2856
01:09:52,724 --> 01:09:54,068
>> AND THEN I'M GOING TO

2857
01:09:54,068 --> 01:09:55,034
A FOUR-YEAR UNIVERSITY, EITHER

2858
01:09:55,034 --> 01:09:56,724
IN TEXAS OR NEW JERSEY,

2859
01:09:56,724 --> 01:09:57,965
AND I WANT TO MAJOR IN

2860
01:09:57,965 --> 01:09:59,103
MATHEMATICS.

2861
01:09:59,103 --> 01:10:00,068
>> OH, NICE.

2862
01:10:00,068 --> 01:10:00,931
ISN'T THAT GOING TO BE TOUGH

2863
01:10:00,931 --> 01:10:01,758
WITH A BABY?

2864
01:10:01,758 --> 01:10:03,206
>> I THINK I CAN DO IT.

2865
01:10:03,206 --> 01:10:05,551
>> BUT YOU'RE ALONE.

2866
01:10:05,551 --> 01:10:06,586
DOES THAT MAKE YOU SAD?

2867
01:10:06,586 --> 01:10:09,344
DOES THAT MAKE YOU SAD?
>> I DON'T KNOW.

2868
01:10:09,344 --> 01:10:13,551
>> I DON'T KNOW.

2869
01:10:13,551 --> 01:10:14,724
>> YEAH, THAT'S THE PART THAT

2870
01:10:14,724 --> 01:10:17,000
GETS ME.

2871
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:18,103
YOU'RE NOT KIND OF ALONE;

2872
01:10:18,103 --> 01:10:22,172
YOU ARE VERY ALONE.

2873
01:10:22,172 --> 01:10:23,344
>> I DON'T CARE, THOUGH.

2874
01:10:23,344 --> 01:10:25,275
I JUST WANT AYDENN TO BE HAPPY.

2875
01:10:25,275 --> 01:10:27,758
I JUST WANT AYDENN TO BE HAPPY.
>> I KNOW. I KNOW.

2876
01:10:27,758 --> 01:10:33,034
>> I KNOW. I KNOW.

2877
01:10:33,034 --> 01:10:35,000
OH, MY GOODNESS.

2878
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,206
FINANCIALLY, HOW DO YOU SUPPORT

2879
01:10:36,206 --> 01:10:37,103
THE BABY.

2880
01:10:37,103 --> 01:10:38,827
>> WELL, MY MOM SENDS MY MONEY

2881
01:10:38,827 --> 01:10:40,000
FROM NEW JERSEY BECAUSE I DON'T

2882
01:10:40,000 --> 01:10:40,827
HAVE A JOB.

2883
01:10:40,827 --> 01:10:43,103
THAT'S HOW I DO THAT.

2884
01:10:43,103 --> 01:10:44,241
>> WELL, TELL ME MORE NOW ABOUT

2885
01:10:44,241 --> 01:10:45,482
GRANDMA BELEN, BECAUSE IT SEEMED

2886
01:10:45,482 --> 01:10:46,586
LIKE SHE REALLY WAS BEING

2887
01:10:46,586 --> 01:10:47,379
HELPFUL AND TOOK YOU IN.

2888
01:10:47,379 --> 01:10:48,206
>> SHE REALLY WAS.

2889
01:10:48,206 --> 01:10:49,000
>> WHAT HAPPENED THERE?

2890
01:10:49,000 --> 01:10:51,172
>> I'M--SHE'S A VERY A GOOD

2891
01:10:51,172 --> 01:10:52,344
PERSON AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL

2892
01:10:52,344 --> 01:10:53,724
FOR HER TAKING ME IN,

2893
01:10:53,724 --> 01:10:56,448
BUT SHE'S GOING TO STICK UP FOR

2894
01:10:56,448 --> 01:10:57,241
HER OWN.

2895
01:10:57,241 --> 01:10:58,413
>> IS THAT WHAT HAPPENED?

2896
01:10:58,413 --> 01:10:59,137
>> YES.

2897
01:10:59,137 --> 01:11:00,000
SO IF ME AND JOEY GOT INTO A

2898
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:01,620
FIGHT, EVEN IF JOEY'S WRONG--

2899
01:11:01,620 --> 01:11:03,206
REGARDLESS WHO WAS WRONG--

2900
01:11:03,206 --> 01:11:04,379
JOEY WAS ALWAYS RIGHT TO HER,

2901
01:11:04,379 --> 01:11:05,448
'CAUSE IT'S HER GRANDSON,

2902
01:11:05,448 --> 01:11:06,620
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT.

2903
01:11:06,620 --> 01:11:08,448
AND THAT'S WHY I'M SURE SHE

2904
01:11:08,448 --> 01:11:09,241
HATES ME NOW.

2905
01:11:09,241 --> 01:11:10,379
THE DAY WE BROKE UP, SHE WENT

2906
01:11:10,379 --> 01:11:11,551
OFF ON ME.

2907
01:11:11,551 --> 01:11:13,034
IT WAS A MESS.

2908
01:11:13,034 --> 01:11:14,620

2943
01:12:15,482 --> 01:12:17,517
BEFORE SHE LEFT.

2944
01:12:17,517 --> 01:12:20,103
AND, LIKE, I TRY TO SEE HIM.

2945
01:12:20,103 --> 01:12:21,689
I DON'T WANT HER TO BE THERE

2946
01:12:21,689 --> 01:12:24,172
WHEN I SEE HIM.

2947
01:12:24,172 --> 01:12:25,379
>> HOW COME?

2948
01:12:25,379 --> 01:12:26,413
>> 'CAUSE I FEEL LIKE I DON'T

2949
01:12:26,413 --> 01:12:28,517
WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH HER.

2950
01:12:28,517 --> 01:12:29,310
>> WHY DO YOU THINK ALLIE DID

2951
01:12:29,310 --> 01:12:30,551
WHAT SHE DID?

2952
01:12:30,551 --> 01:12:31,724
>> WE'RE JUST PROBABLY FADING

2953
01:12:31,724 --> 01:12:32,620
APART.

2954
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:33,586
>> AND THEN HOW ABOUT YOU

2955
01:12:33,586 --> 01:12:34,793
PULLING YOUR WEIGHT WITH THE

2956
01:12:34,793 --> 01:12:35,896
BABY?

2957
01:12:35,896 --> 01:12:37,241
>> I COULD PROBABLY TRY HARDER.

2958
01:12:37,241 --> 01:12:38,758
>> YEAH.

2959
01:12:38,758 --> 01:12:40,379
BELEN, I GET THE SENSE THAT YOU

2960
01:12:40,379 --> 01:12:42,241
GOT HURT BY HER DEPARTURE.

2961
01:12:42,241 --> 01:12:43,620
YOU REALLY WERE ATTACHED TO HER.

2962
01:12:43,620 --> 01:12:45,241
>> YEAH, I WAS ATTACHED TO HER.

2963
01:12:45,241 --> 01:12:46,448
I REALLY WAS ATTACHED TO HER

2964
01:12:46,448 --> 01:12:48,586
AND I WAS ATTACHED TO THE BABY.

2965
01:12:48,586 --> 01:12:49,310
IT'S JUST LIKE...

2966
01:12:49,310 --> 01:12:50,344
>> SO THIS WAS PAINFUL FOR YOUR

2967
01:12:50,344 --> 01:12:51,241
TOO.

2968
01:12:51,241 --> 01:12:52,206
>> YEAH, IT WAS PAINFUL FOR ME.

2969
01:12:52,206 --> 01:12:53,586
FIRST OF ALL, HATS OFF.

2970
01:12:53,586 --> 01:12:55,103
THANK YOU FOR SUPPORTING THESE

2971
01:12:55,103 --> 01:12:55,827
KIDS.

2972
01:12:55,827 --> 01:12:56,586
I MEAN, GOD KNOWS WHERE THEY

2973
01:12:56,586 --> 01:12:57,551
WOULD HAVE BEEN WITHOUT YOU.

2974
01:12:57,551 --> 01:12:59,310
THIS IS TEEN PREGNANCY.

2975
01:12:59,310 --> 01:13:00,827
YOU KNEW WHERE THIS WAS GOING.

2976
01:13:00,827 --> 01:13:02,724
YOU SAW IT.

2977
01:13:02,724 --> 01:13:03,965
ALLIE, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SAY

2978
01:13:03,965 --> 01:13:05,068
ABOUT HOW YOU'RE FEELING ABOUT

2979
01:13:05,068 --> 01:13:06,413
BELEN?

2980
01:13:06,413 --> 01:13:07,689
>> I AM VERY THANKFUL FOR WHAT

2981
01:13:07,689 --> 01:13:08,413
YOU DID FOR ME.

2982
01:13:08,413 --> 01:13:10,103
I KNOW YOU--I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU

2983
01:13:10,103 --> 01:13:11,034
DIDN'T LIKE ME 'CAUSE YOU'RE

2984
01:13:11,034 --> 01:13:12,413
GOING TO TAKE YOUR OWN SIDE,

2985
01:13:12,413 --> 01:13:16,000
SO I'M NOT MAD, BUT IF YOU

2986
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:17,793
WEREN'T HERE, ME AND JOEY

2987
01:13:17,793 --> 01:13:18,586
WOULDN'T EVEN HAD A CHANCE

2988
01:13:18,586 --> 01:13:19,827
TO TRY.

2989
01:13:19,827 --> 01:13:22,241
THANK YOU FOR TAKING ME IN.

2990
01:13:22,241 --> 01:13:23,413
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT THAT I

2991
01:13:23,413 --> 01:13:24,310
DON'T LIKE YOU, ALLISON.

2992
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:25,206
IT'S NOT THAT.

2993
01:13:25,206 --> 01:13:26,862
IT'S JUST THAT IT HURT ME TOO

2994
01:13:26,862 --> 01:13:28,344
BECAUSE I TURNED MY BACK ON MY

2995
01:13:28,344 --> 01:13:32,241
DAUGHTER BECAUSE I DEFENDED YOU,

2996
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:33,068
BECAUSE I KNEW WHERE YOU WERE

2997
01:13:33,068 --> 01:13:33,931
COMING FROM.

2998
01:13:33,931 --> 01:13:36,137
I CAME FROM A BAD RELATIONSHIP.

2999
01:13:36,137 --> 01:13:37,000
>> JUST FOR PEOPLE AT HOME SO

3000
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:37,862
THEY UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE SO

3001
01:13:37,862 --> 01:13:39,586
EMOTIONAL, I FEEL WHAT THIS IS.

3002
01:13:39,586 --> 01:13:40,551
DO YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN WHY

3003
01:13:40,551 --> 01:13:42,137
YOU'RE SO EMOTIONAL?

3004
01:13:42,137 --> 01:13:43,206
>> WELL, WHEN JOEY WAS YELLING

3005
01:13:43,206 --> 01:13:46,034
AT ME IN THE THING ABOUT HOW I'M

3006
01:13:46,034 --> 01:13:48,000
UNGRATEFUL, I DON'T FEEL BAD FOR

3007
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:49,724
HIM, I'M NOT GOING TO LIE,

3008
01:13:49,724 --> 01:13:51,103
BUT I FEEL, LIKE, MORE HURT.

3009
01:13:51,103 --> 01:13:52,206
LIKE, I DIDN'T WANT TO HURT

3010
01:13:52,206 --> 01:13:53,655
BELEN AT ALL BECAUSE SHE'S THE

3011
01:13:53,655 --> 01:13:55,000
ONLY ADULT THAT TOOK ME IN.

3012
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:57,068
>> YEAH. YEAH, I KNOW.

3013
01:13:57,068 --> 01:13:59,724
YOU'RE REALLY IMPORTANT TO HER,

3014
01:13:59,724 --> 01:14:00,965
AND I KNOW YOU'RE HOLDING BACK

3015
01:14:00,965 --> 01:14:01,620
TOO.

3016
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:02,379
I CAN SEE IT.

3017
01:14:02,379 --> 01:14:03,655
>> WELL, I MEAN, I'M NOT GOING,

3018
01:14:03,655 --> 01:14:04,689
LIKE I SAID, I'M NOT GOING TO

3019
01:14:04,689 --> 01:14:05,413
LIE.

3020
01:14:05,413 --> 01:14:06,862
SHE WAS IMPORTANT IN MY LIFE.

3021
01:14:06,862 --> 01:14:07,517
>> I SEE IT.

3022
01:14:07,517 --> 01:14:08,310
>> WE WERE CLOSE.

3023
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:09,275
>> I SEE IT.

3024
01:14:09,275 --> 01:14:11,862
>> BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, I DID

3025
01:14:11,862 --> 01:14:13,344
NOT LIKE THE TURNAROUND THAT SHE

3026
01:14:13,344 --> 01:14:15,172
MADE WHEN SHE STARTED TREATING

3027
01:14:15,172 --> 01:14:16,379
HIM REALLY MEAN.

3028
01:14:16,379 --> 01:14:17,310
THAT HURT ME.

3029
01:14:17,310 --> 01:14:18,103
>> IT'S VERY CONFLICTED.

3030
01:14:18,103 --> 01:14:19,137
I GET IT.

3031
01:14:19,137 --> 01:14:20,448
ALLIE, DO YOU EVER LEAVE THE

3032
01:14:20,448 --> 01:14:21,275
CHILD ALONE WITH ANYBODY?

3033
01:14:21,275 --> 01:14:22,551
>> NO.

3034
01:14:22,551 --> 01:14:23,689
>> NOBODY EVER GETS TO BE ALONE

3035
01:14:23,689 --> 01:14:24,620
WITH THE CHILD WITHOUT YOU

3036
01:14:24,620 --> 01:14:25,310
PRESENT?

3037
01:14:25,310 --> 01:14:26,344
>> WELL, MY FRIEND HAS BEEN

3038
01:14:26,344 --> 01:14:27,758
ALONE WITH HIM, BUT MY FRIEND'S

3039
01:14:27,758 --> 01:14:28,758
NOT GOING TO STEAL AYDENN FROM

3040
01:14:28,758 --> 01:14:29,413
ME.

3041
01:14:29,413 --> 01:14:30,172
AND, LIKE, I DON'T KNOW.

3042
01:14:30,172 --> 01:14:31,241
I KNOW HIS WHOLE FAMILY HATES

3043
01:14:31,241 --> 01:14:32,379
ME, SO THEY'RE GOING TO TRY TO

3044
01:14:32,379 --> 01:14:33,413
DO SOMETHING.

3045
01:14:33,413 --> 01:14:34,241
>> I DID NOT HEAR BELEN SAY SHE

3046
01:14:34,241 --> 01:14:35,000
HATES YOU.

3047
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:35,827
>> WELL, OKAY, NOT BELEN.

3048
01:14:35,827 --> 01:14:36,689
I DON'T KNOW IF JOEY DOES.

3049
01:14:36,689 --> 01:14:37,551
>> WHAT ABOUT BELEN BEING THE

3050
01:14:37,551 --> 01:14:38,586
MEDIATOR?

3051
01:14:38,586 --> 01:14:39,275
>> WELL, IF SHE WANTS TO BE

3052
01:14:39,275 --> 01:14:40,241
THERE, THAT'S FINE, BUT HE

3053
01:14:40,241 --> 01:14:40,931
NEVER--

3054
01:14:40,931 --> 01:14:41,827
>> INSTEAD OF YOU.

3055
01:14:41,827 --> 01:14:43,448
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

3056
01:14:43,448 --> 01:14:46,103
WHAT IF YOLANDA COMES OVER?

3057
01:14:46,103 --> 01:14:46,965
>> WHAT IF YOLANDA COMES OVER?

3058
01:14:46,965 --> 01:14:47,862
WELL, YOU'LL HAVE TO TRUST BELEN

3059
01:14:47,862 --> 01:14:48,793
TO TAKE CARE OF THAT.

3060
01:14:48,793 --> 01:14:49,896
>> WELL, IT'S HER DAUGHTER.

3061
01:14:49,896 --> 01:14:50,793
SHE'S GOING TO PICK HER DAUGHTER

3062
01:14:50,793 --> 01:14:51,482
OVER ME.

3063
01:14:51,482 --> 01:14:52,379
>> IN BELEN'S EYE, I DON'T KNOW

3064
01:14:52,379 --> 01:14:53,034
THAT.

3065
01:14:53,034 --> 01:14:53,862
I THINK THE BABY--SHE CAN PUT

3066
01:14:53,862 --> 01:14:54,931
THE BABY AHEAD OF MOST INTEREST,

3067
01:14:54,931 --> 01:14:55,862
I WOULD SAY.

3068
01:14:55,862 --> 01:14:56,517
>> I DON'T KNOW.

3069
01:14:56,517 --> 01:14:57,413
I DON'T TRUST IT.

3070
01:14:57,413 --> 01:14:58,137
I DON'T TRUST AYDENN BEING

3071
01:14:58,137 --> 01:14:59,620
AROUND THEM WITHOUT ME,

3072
01:14:59,620 --> 01:15:00,448
AND I KNOW IT'S HIS DAD, HIS

3073
01:15:00,448 --> 01:15:01,172
FAMILY, BUT...

3074
01:15:01,172 --> 01:15:02,827
>> ALLIE, IT'S SCARY FOR YOU.

3075
01:15:02,827 --> 01:15:03,758
>> YEAH, I DON'T--

3076
01:15:03,758 --> 01:15:05,172
>> LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT TRUST.

3077
01:15:05,172 --> 01:15:07,068
LET'S TALK ABOUT YOU'RE SCARED.

3078
01:15:07,068 --> 01:15:07,758
>> YEAH.

3079
01:15:07,758 --> 01:15:10,206
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT SHE THINKS

3080
01:15:10,206 --> 01:15:13,172
THAT, YOU KNOW, YOLANDA OR JOE

3081
01:15:13,172 --> 01:15:14,448
WILL TRY TO TAKE THE BABY.

3082
01:15:14,448 --> 01:15:16,137
BUT IF I'M IN THERE, THEY'RE NOT

3083
01:15:16,137 --> 01:15:17,862
GOING TO TAKE THE BABY.

3084
01:15:17,862 --> 01:15:20,379
FIRST OF ALL, ALLISON, YOU DON'T

3085
01:15:20,379 --> 01:15:21,551
HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT ME TRYING TO

3086
01:15:21,551 --> 01:15:22,551
STEAL THE BABY.

3087
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:24,896
YOU KNOW ME--I DON'T BABYSIT.

3088
01:15:24,896 --> 01:15:26,034
SO YOU KNOW ME.

3089
01:15:26,034 --> 01:15:27,000
IF YOU'RE FIVE MINUTES LATE,

3090
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:27,896
I'LL BE ON THAT PHONE.

3091
01:15:27,896 --> 01:15:28,689
"YOU BETTER COME PICK UP THIS

3092
01:15:28,689 --> 01:15:31,206
BABY, 'CAUSE I'M GOING OUT

3093
01:15:31,206 --> 01:15:32,758
TONIGHT."

3094
01:15:32,758 --> 01:15:35,034
>> NOW, THE BABY IS HERE.

3095
01:15:35,034 --> 01:15:36,034
DO YOU WANT TO TAKE A RISK AND

3096
01:15:36,034 --> 01:15:37,068
BRING THE BABY OUT AND SEE HOW

3097
01:15:37,068 --> 01:15:38,689
THAT FEELS AND...

3098
01:15:38,689 --> 01:15:39,827
'CAUSE, I MEAN, YOU DO WANT THE

3099
01:15:39,827 --> 01:15:42,137
BABY TO HAVE A DADDY.

3100
01:15:42,137 --> 01:15:43,172
>> I'D LIKE TO SEE HIM.

3101
01:15:43,172 --> 01:15:43,965
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN TWO

3102
01:15:43,965 --> 01:15:44,862
MONTHS.

3103
01:15:44,862 --> 01:15:45,793
>> I'D BE NICE FOR BELEN.

3104
01:15:45,793 --> 01:15:46,793
>> ALL RIGHT.

3105
01:15:46,793 --> 01:15:47,620
>> JOEY, HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT

3106
01:15:47,620 --> 01:15:49,000
US BRINGING THE BABY OUT?

3107
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:51,068
IS THAT EXCITING FOR YOU?

3108
01:15:51,068 --> 01:15:54,551
>> HAVE A FEELING I'M GONNA CRY.

3109
01:15:54,551 --> 01:15:56,344
>> ALL RIGHT, WELL, JOEY HASN'T

3110
01:15:56,344 --> 01:15:57,827
SEEN AYDENN FOR MANY MONTHS.

3111
01:15:57,827 --> 01:15:59,103
ARE YOU READY?

3112
01:15:59,103 --> 01:16:02,000
OKAY, LAUREN, COME ON OUT.

3113
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:04,379
THERE HE IS.

3114
01:16:04,379 --> 01:16:09,068
>> YAY.

3115
01:16:09,068 --> 01:16:09,862
>> COME ON, LAUREN.

3123
01:16:25,103 --> 01:16:26,724
>> I DON'T THINK HE LIKES ME.

3124
01:16:26,724 --> 01:16:29,689
[laughter]

3125
01:16:29,689 --> 01:16:31,482
>> HE'S JUST LIKE THAT.

3126
01:16:31,482 --> 01:16:32,344
>> HE'S JUST WAKING UP.

3127
01:16:32,344 --> 01:16:33,241
HE DOESN'T LIKE WAKING UP,

3128
01:16:33,241 --> 01:16:34,103
THAT'S WHAT HE DOESN'T LIKE.

3129
01:16:34,103 --> 01:16:34,827
>> THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

3130
01:16:34,827 --> 01:16:35,655
>> ACTUALLY HE'S JUST FALLING

3131
01:16:35,655 --> 01:16:36,482
ASLEEP.

3132
01:16:36,482 --> 01:16:37,413
>> JOEY, JUST TELL US WHAT

3133
01:16:37,413 --> 01:16:39,000
YOU'RE FEELING.

3134
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:39,689
>> GOOD.

3135
01:16:39,689 --> 01:16:41,344
>> JOY?

3136
01:16:41,344 --> 01:16:42,689
>> HAPPINESS.

3137
01:16:42,689 --> 01:16:43,896
>> IF YOU GET THIS AS THE

3138
01:16:43,896 --> 01:16:46,827
BENEFIT, ISN'T IT VERY LITTLE TO

3139
01:16:46,827 --> 01:16:48,310
ASK THAT YOU LET ALLIE COME

3140
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:49,344
ALONG WITH THE BABY,

3141
01:16:49,344 --> 01:16:51,137
EVEN IF SHE WAITS OUTSIDE AND

3142
01:16:51,137 --> 01:16:53,103
JUST--AS THE MOM, SHE JUST NEEDS

3143
01:16:53,103 --> 01:16:54,551
TO BE AROUND THE BABY.

3144
01:16:54,551 --> 01:16:56,413
>> YEAH.

3145
01:16:56,413 --> 01:16:58,965
>> MIGHT BE A COMPROMISE, RIGHT?

3146
01:16:58,965 --> 01:17:00,448
NOW, LAUREN, YOU'RE NEW TO US

3147
01:17:00,448 --> 01:17:02,000
OUT HERE.

3148
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:03,620
YOU ARE ALLIE'S MOM.

3149
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:04,448

3150
01:17:04,448 --> 01:17:05,827

3152
01:17:06,758 --> 01:17:09,551
>> HOW DID YOU LOSE CONTROL OF

3153
01:17:09,551 --> 01:17:10,551
YOUR DAUGHTER LIKE THIS?

3154
01:17:10,551 --> 01:17:12,551
SHE MOVED TO TEXAS.

3155
01:17:12,551 --> 01:17:14,206
>> WELL, SHE MOVED TO TEXAS WITH

3156
01:17:14,206 --> 01:17:16,413
HER FATHER.

3157
01:17:16,413 --> 01:17:17,137
>> DID THAT SEEM LIKE A GOOD

3158
01:17:17,137 --> 01:17:17,931
DECISION IN RETROSPECT?

3159
01:17:17,931 --> 01:17:19,620
>> I BLAME MYSELF FOR THE FACT

3160
01:17:19,620 --> 01:17:21,896
THAT BECAUSE I LEFT HER WITH

3161
01:17:21,896 --> 01:17:24,827
HER DAD, DID SHE PERHAPS FEEL

3162
01:17:24,827 --> 01:17:27,172
ABANDONED OR THAT I DIDN'T LOVE

3163
01:17:27,172 --> 01:17:32,689
HER OR...

3164
01:17:32,689 --> 01:17:35,551
I JUST--I JUST WANTED TO DO THE

3165
01:17:35,551 --> 01:17:36,931
RIGHT THING.

3166
01:17:36,931 --> 01:17:38,068
>> WELL, LET'S ASK THIS, LAUREN,

3167
01:17:38,068 --> 01:17:39,413
'CAUSE WE SEE THIS IN THE

3168
01:17:39,413 --> 01:17:41,344
EPISODE THAT SHE TELLS YOU SHE'S

3169
01:17:41,344 --> 01:17:42,517
PREGNANT.

3170
01:17:42,517 --> 01:17:43,413
HOW COME YOU DIDN'T COME GET HER

3171
01:17:43,413 --> 01:17:44,206
RIGHT THEN?

3172
01:17:44,206 --> 01:17:45,655
>> SHE DIDN'T WANT TO GO.

3173
01:17:45,655 --> 01:17:46,620
>> YOU TRIED?

3174
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:47,448
>> YES.

3175
01:17:47,448 --> 01:17:48,551
>> WHY DIDN'T YOU WANT TO GO?

3176
01:17:48,551 --> 01:17:49,896
>> I WANTED TO STAY FOR JOEY.

3177
01:17:49,896 --> 01:17:50,896
>> STAY FOR JOEY.

3178
01:17:50,896 --> 01:17:52,379
SO, ALLIE, WHAT ROLE DOES LAUREN

>> YEAH.

3183
01:17:55,862 --> 01:17:56,724
>> IS SHE AROUND ENOUGH FOR YOU?

>> ALWAYS.

3185
01:17:57,620 --> 01:17:58,862

01:18:06,551 --> 01:18:07,517
WHATEVER YOU DON'T GET,

3192
01:18:07,517 --> 01:18:08,413
I GOT IT.

3193
01:18:08,413 --> 01:18:09,586

>> MAYBE WE CAN TRY TO WORK

3201
01:18:19,379 --> 01:18:20,172
SOMETHING OUT.

3202
01:18:20,172 --> 01:18:21,551

WHEN THE BABY'S AROUND?

3205
01:18:23,379 --> 01:18:24,137
>> WELL, I'M GOING TO HAVE TO

3206
01:18:24,137 --> 01:18:24,827
DEAL WITH IT.

OKAY.

3219
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:37,862
THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT

3220
01:18:37,862 --> 01:18:39,241

IT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY.

3226
01:18:45,551 --> 01:18:47,034

01:20:36,758 --> 01:20:38,103
IT SHOULD BE A LITTLE HARDER

3287
01:20:38,103 --> 01:20:39,586
FOR THE GIRLS WHO HAVE GIRLS,

NATHAN WENT WRONG.

3300
01:20:55,068 --> 01:20:55,862

01:20:55,862 --> 01:20:57,241
WERE NAIVE?

3302
01:20:57,241 --> 01:20:59,000

3304
01:21:01,137 --> 01:21:03,586
TO WHERE WE WANTED IT.

3305
01:21:03,586 --> 01:21:05,206

01:21:06,172 --> 01:21:07,241

01:21:11,482 --> 01:21:13,172
>> WHO HAS A RESPONSE TO THAT?

3312
01:21:13,172 --> 01:21:14,793
>> I DEFINITELY NOTICED THAT

3313
01:21:14,793 --> 01:21:17,793
RYAN CHANGED AFTER MIAH CAME.

3314
01:21:17,793 --> 01:21:18,689
I CHANGED MY NUMBER AND STUFF,

3315
01:21:18,689 --> 01:21:19,655
BUT HE COULD HAVE COME UP TO ME

3316
01:21:19,655 --> 01:21:20,827
AT SCHOOL AND BEEN LIKE, "HOW IS

3317
01:21:20,827 --> 01:21:22,310
MIAH? IS SHE OKAY?"

3318
01:21:22,310 --> 01:21:23,965
BUT FOR FOUR MONTHS, HE DID NOT

3319
01:21:23,965 --> 01:21:25,551
EVEN BOTHER TO TALK TO ME,

3320
01:21:25,551 --> 01:21:26,655
DIDN'T SAY, "DOES SHE NEED

3321
01:21:26,655 --> 01:21:27,310
ANYTHING?"

3322
01:21:27,310 --> 01:21:28,620

3323
01:21:28,620 --> 01:21:29,758
WITH HIS GIRLFRIEND, WORRIED

3324
01:21:29,758 --> 01:21:31,448

3325
01:21:31,448 --> 01:21:32,413
