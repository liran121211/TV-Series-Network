I'M MATURE FOR MY AGE,

14
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:20,158
WHICH IS PROBABLY WHY

15
00:00:20,261 --> 00:00:21,987
I FELL FOR MY BOYFRIEND, COLIN.

MY TWO SISTERS, MY MOM...

30
00:00:43,664 --> 00:00:44,768

>> MATH.

40
00:00:55,538 --> 00:00:56,642

IS A TEEN MOM,

42
00:00:57,954 --> 00:00:59,404

MOVE IN WITH US

AFTER WE STARTED DATING

00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:16,766
TO MAKE ROOM FOR ONE MORE

56
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:17,422

EVEN THOUGH THERE'S A LOT

66
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:35,129
OF PEOPLE AT MY MOM'S,

67
00:01:35,233 --> 00:01:36,337
IT'S GOOD PRACTICE TO HAVE

00:01:46,209 --> 00:01:47,383
ALTHOUGH IT WASN'T EASY

75
00:01:47,486 --> 00:01:48,660
AT FIRST.

76
00:01:48,763 --> 00:01:50,386
IN THE BEGINNING, WE WENT FROM

77
00:01:50,489 --> 00:01:52,388
SNEAKING YOU INTO THE HOUSE.

78
00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:53,458
MY MOM DIDN'T KNOW

YOUR MOM JUST WALKED IN,

82
00:01:57,013 --> 00:01:59,360
AND I WAS SLEEPING IN THE BED.

83
00:01:59,464 --> 00:02:00,189
>> AND THEN, AFTER THAT,

84
00:02:00,292 --> 00:02:01,500
YOU STARTED LIVING THERE.

85
00:02:01,604 --> 00:02:02,225
>> AND THEN SHE WAS LIKE,

"I DON'T CARE."

I WASN'T REALLY LOOKING

I GUESS NOBODY'S PREPARED

113
00:02:40,539 --> 00:02:43,093
FOR A BABY, BUT WE DID IT.

114
00:02:43,197 --> 00:02:45,095
TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT.

115
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,959

[chime dings]

122
00:02:55,865 --> 00:02:57,625
COLIN HAS TWO JOBS.

AT A WAREHOUSE,

125
00:02:59,558 --> 00:03:00,766

OF THE ARMY RESERVES,

128
00:03:03,493 --> 00:03:04,287

I CAN FOCUS ON FINISHING SCHOOL,

134
00:03:12,364 --> 00:03:13,745

SHOCKED WHEN I GOT PREGNANT,

00:04:31,616 --> 00:04:32,237
THIS IS SCARY.

192
00:04:32,341 --> 00:04:33,376
I'M SCARED.

193
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,240
>> I'M SCARED FOR YOU.

194
00:04:35,344 --> 00:04:36,310
>> IT'S NOT GOING TO BE

195
00:04:36,414 --> 00:04:39,624
"US" ANYMORE.

196
00:04:39,727 --> 00:04:40,763
>> IT'S STARTING TO SINK IN

197
00:04:40,866 --> 00:04:43,524
THAT EVERYTHING'S GONNA CHANGE.

198
00:04:46,907 --> 00:04:47,804
LUCKILY, I'LL HAVE

199
00:04:47,908 --> 00:04:49,047
MY FAMILY'S SUPPORT.

200
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:51,152
>> [screams]

201
00:04:51,256 --> 00:04:52,153
>> THERE'S ALREADY EIGHT OF US

202
00:04:52,257 --> 00:04:53,051
IN THE HOUSE,

203
00:04:53,154 --> 00:04:54,708
AND SOON THERE'LL BE NINE.

204
00:04:54,811 --> 00:04:57,711
>> HOW LONG YOU GONNA BE?

205
00:04:57,814 --> 00:04:59,091
>> ALL RIGHT.

206
00:04:59,195 --> 00:05:00,783
GUESS I'M GOING UPSTAIRS.

207
00:05:00,886 --> 00:05:02,302
>> IT'S GONNA BE TIGHT,

208
00:05:02,405 --> 00:05:03,475
BUT AT LEAST I'LL HAVE

209
00:05:03,579 --> 00:05:04,925
LOTS OF HELP,

210
00:05:05,028 --> 00:05:06,409
AND I'LL HAVE MY SISTER JANE

211
00:05:06,513 --> 00:05:08,308
TO GO TO FOR ADVICE.

212
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:10,137
SHE HAD A KID AT 17

213
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,657
AND IS NOW A SINGLE MOM.

214
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:14,866
THAT'S FUN.

215
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:23,806
>> SO I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS.

216
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:24,634
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT,

217
00:05:24,738 --> 00:05:26,878
LIKE, THE LIVING SITUATION

218
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:28,569
WITH ALL THESE BABIES

219
00:05:28,673 --> 00:05:30,709
GONNA BE IN ONE ROOF?

220
00:05:30,813 --> 00:05:31,745
>> I'M JUST GLAD THAT I HAVE,

221
00:05:31,848 --> 00:05:33,367
LIKE, SOMEBODY ELSE HELPING ME.

222
00:05:33,471 --> 00:05:34,472
LIKE, I'M NOT BY MYSELF.

223
00:05:34,575 --> 00:05:39,442
LIKE, I GOT YOU, MOM, AND COLIN.

224
00:05:39,546 --> 00:05:40,788
>> IT'S CRAMPED IN THIS HOUSE.

225
00:05:40,892 --> 00:05:41,686
>> JUST SO MUCH STRESS

226
00:05:41,789 --> 00:05:42,514
RIGHT NOW.

227
00:05:42,618 --> 00:05:43,446
I JUST HAVE TO THINK ABOUT,

228
00:05:43,550 --> 00:05:44,274
GOD, I'M NOT EVEN DONE

229
00:05:44,378 --> 00:05:45,310
WITH SCHOOL YET.

230
00:05:45,414 --> 00:05:46,622
>> EVEN THE LITTLEST THINGS

231
00:05:46,725 --> 00:05:48,555
AREN'T EASY ANYMORE.

232
00:05:48,658 --> 00:05:50,039
GOING TO SCHOOL AFTER BEING

233
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:51,454
UP ALL NIGHT, AND THEN TRY

234
00:05:51,558 --> 00:05:54,250
TO STAY AWAKE THROUGH CLASS,

235
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,113
AND THEN COME HOME

236
00:05:55,216 --> 00:05:56,356
AND DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN.

237
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:57,978
I MEAN, IT'S ALL HARD.

238
00:05:58,081 --> 00:05:58,875
>> I DON'T KNOW, I GUESS

239
00:05:58,979 --> 00:05:59,945
WE'LL FIGURE ALL THAT OUT

240
00:06:00,049 --> 00:06:00,705
WHEN IT COMES OUT.

241
00:06:00,808 --> 00:06:01,395
I DON'T REALLY KNOW

242
00:06:01,499 --> 00:06:02,603
WHAT TO EXPECT.

243
00:06:02,707 --> 00:06:04,260
>> YEAH.

244
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,226
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GONNA

245
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:07,919
JUGGLE SCHOOL WITH A BABY,

246
00:06:08,022 --> 00:06:09,023
AND I'M STILL DEALING

247
00:06:09,127 --> 00:06:14,512
WITH MY MOM'S DISAPPOINTMENT.

248
00:06:14,615 --> 00:06:15,340
>> HONESTLY,

249
00:06:15,444 --> 00:06:18,654
IT'S KIND OF EMBARRASSING.

250
00:06:18,757 --> 00:06:19,551
>> RUDE.

251
00:06:19,655 --> 00:06:20,621
>> THAT'S NOT RUDE.

252
00:06:20,725 --> 00:06:21,726
IT'S HONEST.

253
00:06:21,829 --> 00:06:23,175
SINCE YOUR OLDER SISTER

254
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,418
GOT PREGNANT,

255
00:06:24,522 --> 00:06:26,834
I DIDN'T WANT THAT FOR YOU.

256
00:06:26,938 --> 00:06:29,803
YOU THINK, "IT HAPPENED ONCE."

257
00:06:29,906 --> 00:06:30,838
>> I MEAN, AT LEAST I, LIKE,

258
00:06:30,942 --> 00:06:32,288
TRIED TO BE ON BIRTH CONTROL--

259
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,254
>> YEAH, I KNOW THAT.

260
00:06:33,358 --> 00:06:33,945
>> AND TRIED TO BE

261
00:06:34,048 --> 00:06:35,912
RESPONSIBLE ABOUT IT.

262
00:06:36,016 --> 00:06:36,775
JUST GOT TO FINISH SCHOOL

263
00:06:36,879 --> 00:06:38,777
AND GO TO COLLEGE.

264
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:40,641
>> IT'S JUST GONNA BE HARD.

265
00:06:40,745 --> 00:06:41,642
DO WE HAVE CHILD CARE

266
00:06:41,746 --> 00:06:42,471
ARRANGEMENTS?

267
00:06:42,574 --> 00:06:43,610
HAVE YOU EVEN THOUGHT OF THAT?

268
00:06:43,713 --> 00:06:44,818
>> I MEAN, NOT YET.

269
00:06:44,921 --> 00:06:45,474
>> I JUST WORRY ABOUT

270
00:06:45,577 --> 00:06:47,337
WHEN REALITY HITS.

271
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:48,994
>> OH, IT ALREADY HAS.

272
00:06:49,098 --> 00:06:49,719
TRUST ME.

273
00:06:49,823 --> 00:06:53,171
>> NO, IT HASN'T.

274
00:06:53,274 --> 00:06:54,552
I'LL HELP AS MUCH AS I CAN,

275
00:06:54,655 --> 00:06:56,105
DEVON, BUT I'M NOT GONNA RAISE

276
00:06:56,208 --> 00:06:59,246
THIS CHILD.

277
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:03,353
>> [bleep].

278
00:07:08,289 --> 00:07:10,360
>> I KNOW IT'S HARD.

279
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:13,191
>> 'CAUSE I'M GONNA MISS OUT

280
00:07:13,294 --> 00:07:15,469
ON EVERYTHING.

281
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,657
>> MY MOM HAS MADE ME REALIZE

282
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,762
HOW HARD THINGS ARE GONNA BE,

283
00:07:32,866 --> 00:07:34,419
AND EVEN THOUGH COLIN MAKES

284
00:07:34,523 --> 00:07:36,283
ENOUGH MONEY FOR NOW, WE STILL

285
00:07:36,386 --> 00:07:40,736
HAVE A LOT TO FIGURE OUT.

286
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,116
WE HAVE ABOUT, WHAT,

287
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:42,910
THREE MONTHS?

288
00:07:43,014 --> 00:07:43,704
>> YEAH.

289
00:07:43,808 --> 00:07:44,809
>> I'M GONNA STOCK UP

290
00:07:44,912 --> 00:07:47,501
ON DIAPERS AND WIPES.

291
00:07:47,605 --> 00:07:49,020
>> IT'S GONNA BE HARD.

292
00:07:49,123 --> 00:07:50,055
I JUST DON'T WANT TO DISAPPOINT

293
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:51,919
YOU GUYS BECAUSE I WANT

294
00:07:52,023 --> 00:07:52,782
TO BE ABLE TO, YOU KNOW,

295
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:54,370
BUY THE THINGS FOR THE BABY

296
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:56,752
AND EVERYTHING AND PAY THE BILLS

297
00:07:56,855 --> 00:07:57,925
WITHOUT TROUBLE INSTEAD

298
00:07:58,029 --> 00:07:59,479
OF LIVING PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK,

299
00:07:59,582 --> 00:08:00,652
BE ABLE TO SAVE MORE MONEY

300
00:08:00,756 --> 00:08:02,343
FOR THE BABY, SO...

301
00:08:02,447 --> 00:08:03,379
>> I MEAN, I DO WANT TO FINISH

302
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,762
SCHOOL AND GO TO COLLEGE

303
00:08:06,865 --> 00:08:08,764
AND WORK IN THE MEDICAL FIELD.

304
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:09,385
I MEAN, I THINK

305
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,213
IT WOULD BE GOOD.

306
00:08:10,317 --> 00:08:10,869
AS LONG AS WE'RE SUPPORTING

307
00:08:10,973 --> 00:08:11,663
EACH OTHER.

308
00:08:11,767 --> 00:08:12,630
>> YEAH.

309
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:13,872
>> AND THE BABY.

310
00:08:13,976 --> 00:08:15,840
I JUST WANT TO GIVE HIM, LIKE,

311
00:08:15,943 --> 00:08:17,013
A GOOD LIFE, AND HE WON'T HAVE

312
00:08:17,117 --> 00:08:19,671
TO, LIKE, STRUGGLE.

313
00:08:29,681 --> 00:08:31,027
COLIN IS GOING ON RESERVE DUTY

314
00:08:31,131 --> 00:08:32,650
FOR A FEW DAYS.

315
00:08:32,753 --> 00:08:36,274
>> [whispers] IT'S 5:30.

316
00:08:36,377 --> 00:08:38,172
>> IT SUCKS FOR HIM TO BE AWAY,

317
00:08:38,276 --> 00:08:39,001
BUT IT'S BETTER

318
00:08:39,104 --> 00:08:42,832
THAN HIM SERVING FULL-TIME.

319
00:08:42,936 --> 00:08:43,868
WHILE COLIN'S GONE,

320
00:08:43,971 --> 00:08:44,938
I NEED TO START FOCUSING

321
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:46,802
ON SCHOOL, AND TODAY,

322
00:08:46,905 --> 00:08:49,356
I START MY SENIOR YEAR.

323
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:51,116
I REALLY WANT TO GRADUATE,

324
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,462
BUT I'M SEVEN MONTHS PREGNANT,

325
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:53,533
AND THIS IS MY FIRST DAY

326
00:08:53,636 --> 00:08:55,396
AT SCHOOL WITH A BIG BELLY.

327
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,537
>> DROP YOU OFF ON THIS SIDE?

328
00:08:59,297 --> 00:09:00,194
>> CAN I GO THIS WAY?

329
00:09:00,298 --> 00:09:01,161
>> YEAH.

330
00:09:01,264 --> 00:09:02,231
>> ALL RIGHT.

331
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:03,025
ALL RIGHT, BABY,

332
00:09:03,128 --> 00:09:04,613
YOU GONNA BE OKAY?

333
00:09:04,716 --> 00:09:05,441
>> YEAH, I'LL BE FINE.

334
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:06,718
>> ALL RIGHT, I LOVE YOU.

335
00:09:06,822 --> 00:09:09,307
YOU HAVE A GOOD DAY, OKAY?

336
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:11,136
[chime dings]

337
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,104
>> SCHOOL WAS REALLY HARD.

338
00:09:13,207 --> 00:09:14,761
THE HALLWAYS ARE SO CROWDED.

339
00:09:14,864 --> 00:09:16,279
EVERYBODY STARES AT ME.

340
00:09:16,383 --> 00:09:17,039
I DON'T KNOW HOW

341
00:09:17,142 --> 00:09:17,867
I'M GONNA DEAL WITH THIS

342
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:22,907
FOR THE NEXT FEW MONTHS.

343
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:24,633
I'M JUST IRRITATED.

344
00:09:24,736 --> 00:09:25,495
>> ABOUT WHAT?

345
00:09:25,599 --> 00:09:27,152
>> 'CAUSE FRICKING SCHOOL.

346
00:09:27,256 --> 00:09:28,291
I STARTED CRYING BECAUSE

347
00:09:28,395 --> 00:09:29,085
I DIDN'T WANT TO BE THERE,

348
00:09:29,189 --> 00:09:30,500
AND I WAS FRUSTRATED,

349
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:32,019
AND, LIKE, MY FEET JUST HURT.

350
00:09:32,123 --> 00:09:32,986
LIKE, IT'S JUST SO MUCH,

351
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:35,540
AND I'M REALLY TIRED.

352
00:09:35,644 --> 00:09:37,231
I JUST FEEL LIKE PEOPLE JUST,

353
00:09:37,335 --> 00:09:38,163
LIKE, TREAT ME DIFFERENT

354
00:09:38,267 --> 00:09:39,199
NOW THAT I'M PREGNANT.

355
00:09:39,302 --> 00:09:39,855
>> HOW DO THEY TREAT YOU

356
00:09:39,958 --> 00:09:40,683
DIFFERENT?

357
00:09:40,787 --> 00:09:41,615
ARE THEY, LIKE, MEAN TO YOU?

358
00:09:41,719 --> 00:09:42,616
>> I MEAN, THEY'RE NOT MEAN.

359
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,583
I MEAN, I CAN HEAR PEOPLE TALK

360
00:09:43,686 --> 00:09:44,618
ABOUT ME, LIKE, "LOOK AT HER."

361
00:09:44,722 --> 00:09:45,654
>> YOU DO?

362
00:09:45,757 --> 00:09:46,586
>> LIKE, PEOPLE ALWAYS

LIKE THEY'VE NEVER SEEN

365
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,728
A PREGNANT PERSON BEFORE.

366
00:09:50,831 --> 00:09:51,418
I'M JUST FED UP

367
00:09:51,521 --> 00:09:52,074
WITH THE PEOPLE THERE.

368
00:09:52,177 --> 00:09:52,764
I HATE IT.

369
00:09:52,868 --> 00:09:55,456
>> MM-HMM.

370
00:10:03,188 --> 00:10:06,226
>> COLIN'S BACK FROM DUTY.

371
00:10:06,329 --> 00:10:07,123
WHERE'S THAT GONNA GO?

372
00:10:07,227 --> 00:10:07,848
>> MAYBE THE CLOSET.

373
00:10:07,952 --> 00:10:08,780
I DON'T KNOW.

374
00:10:08,884 --> 00:10:10,437
>> GOOD LUCK.

375
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:12,128
IT'S GOOD TO HAVE HIM HOME,

376
00:10:12,232 --> 00:10:13,233
BUT OUR STUFF IS REALLY

377
00:10:13,336 --> 00:10:17,099
STARTING TO PILE UP.

378
00:10:17,202 --> 00:10:17,824
>> WE GOT TO FIGURE

379
00:10:17,927 --> 00:10:18,514
SOMETHING OUT

380
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,827
'CAUSE THIS SUCKS.

381
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:22,967
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF SPACE.

382
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:23,795
I MEAN, WHEN HE COMES,

383
00:10:23,899 --> 00:10:25,383
WHERE'S ALL HIS STUFF GONNA GO?

384
00:10:25,486 --> 00:10:26,211
>> MM-MM-MM.

385
00:10:26,315 --> 00:10:27,109
I GUESS RIGHT NOW WE'RE GONNA

386
00:10:27,212 --> 00:10:28,006
DEAL WITH WHAT WE HAVE.

387
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:30,353
I'M NOT COMPLAINING.

388
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,221
IT'S NOT THAT BAD LIVING HERE.

389
00:10:36,325 --> 00:10:37,913
COULD BE WORSE.

390
00:10:38,016 --> 00:10:38,568
>> I MEAN, I DON'T MIND

391
00:10:38,672 --> 00:10:39,397
STAYING HERE.

392
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,295
I'D JUST LIKE TO HAVE KIND OF

393
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,539
MORE SPACE THAN WHAT WE GOT.

394
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:44,367
>> HONESTLY, I'M NOT EVEN

395
00:10:44,471 --> 00:10:47,163
STRESSING TO GET OUT OF HERE.

396
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:48,164
I MEAN, IT'S FREE.

397
00:10:48,268 --> 00:10:48,924
>> WHAT, DO YOU JUST WANT

398
00:10:49,027 --> 00:10:49,752
TO STAY HERE INSTEAD OF

399
00:10:49,856 --> 00:10:50,408
GETTING OUR OWN PLACE?

400
00:10:50,511 --> 00:10:51,167
'CAUSE I--

401
00:10:51,271 --> 00:10:52,030
>> I MEAN, I'M NOT TRYING

402
00:10:52,134 --> 00:10:52,824
TO CONVINCE YOU TO STAY HERE,

403
00:10:52,928 --> 00:10:53,618
BUT IF YOU DON'T

404
00:10:53,722 --> 00:10:54,688
HAVE THE MONEY TO MOVE OUT,

405
00:10:54,792 --> 00:10:55,551
WHY WOULD YOU WANT, LIKE--

406
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,173
WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO MOVE OUT?

407
00:10:57,277 --> 00:10:57,967
>> WELL, I KNOW YOU LIKE

408
00:10:58,071 --> 00:10:59,003
BEING CLOSE TO YOUR FAMILY

409
00:10:59,106 --> 00:11:00,142
AND EVERYTHING.

410
00:11:00,245 --> 00:11:01,212
I JUST LIKE HAVING MY PRIVACY,

411
00:11:01,315 --> 00:11:02,006
YOU KNOW?

412
00:11:02,109 --> 00:11:02,627
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT WE'RE

413
00:11:02,731 --> 00:11:04,180
GONNA HAVE LANDON.

414
00:11:04,284 --> 00:11:05,423
I MEAN, I'M A LITTLE OLDER

415
00:11:05,526 --> 00:11:07,252
THAN YOU, SO I'M, LIKE,

416
00:11:07,356 --> 00:11:08,426
PAST THAT STAGE OF WANTING TO

417
00:11:08,529 --> 00:11:10,290
STAY AT HOME WITH MOMMY, SO...

418
00:11:10,393 --> 00:11:11,567
>> I'M JUST SAYING I JUST WANT

419
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:12,430
TO BE ON MY FEET, AND I WANT

420
00:11:12,533 --> 00:11:13,327
TO MAKE SURE I'M READY

421
00:11:13,431 --> 00:11:15,882
BEFORE I JUMP INTO ANYTHING.

422
00:11:15,985 --> 00:11:16,986
>> I JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO

423
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:17,987
PULL INTO MY OWN DRIVEWAY--

424
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:18,712
>> I JUST WANT TO--

425
00:11:18,816 --> 00:11:19,402
DON'T WANT TO BE BROKE.

426
00:11:19,506 --> 00:11:20,887
>> GO TO MY OWN ROOM.

427
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:21,750
WHEN I HAVE THE MONEY TO GET

428
00:11:21,853 --> 00:11:23,544
A HOUSE, I'M GONNA GET A HOUSE.

429
00:11:23,648 --> 00:11:25,098
>> WELL, WHEN THE TIME IS RIGHT,

430
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:27,100
THEN WE'LL GO.

431
00:11:27,203 --> 00:11:28,446
>> JUST HOPEFULLY THAT'S,

432
00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:31,898
YOU KNOW, NOT TOO FAR AWAY.

433
00:11:32,001 --> 00:11:33,106
>> I UNDERSTAND WHY COLIN

434
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:34,486
WANTS TO MOVE OUT,

435
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:35,556
BUT I REALLY DON'T THINK

436
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,766
WE CAN AFFORD IT ON OUR OWN.

437
00:11:47,637 --> 00:11:48,708
>> I'M DUE IN A MONTH,

438
00:11:48,811 --> 00:11:50,226
AND COLIN IS STILL DEAD SET

439
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,227
ON BUYING A HOUSE.

440
00:11:51,331 --> 00:11:52,125
>> THIS IS THE ONE I LIKE.

441
00:11:52,228 --> 00:11:54,058
IT'S GOT THREE BEDROOMS.

442
00:11:54,161 --> 00:11:55,024
>> BUT I DON'T THINK WE CAN

443
00:11:55,128 --> 00:11:56,301
MAKE IT WORK.

444
00:11:56,405 --> 00:11:58,062
HOPEFULLY MY MOM CAN REASON

445
00:11:58,165 --> 00:11:58,959
WITH HIM.

446
00:11:59,063 --> 00:11:59,960
 HOLA.

447
00:12:00,064 --> 00:12:02,445
>> HEY.

448
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:03,170
>> WE WERE JUST TALKING

449
00:12:03,274 --> 00:12:04,206
ABOUT MOVING OUT.

450
00:12:04,309 --> 00:12:05,552
WE WANTED YOUR OPINION.

451
00:12:05,655 --> 00:12:06,311
>> OH, YEAH?

452
00:12:06,415 --> 00:12:07,934
WHERE ARE YOU MOVING TO?

453
00:12:08,037 --> 00:12:09,832
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

454
00:12:09,936 --> 00:12:10,488
>> I JUST WANT TO HAVE

455
00:12:10,591 --> 00:12:12,317
MY OWN HOUSE.

456
00:12:12,421 --> 00:12:13,249
>> I MEAN, DO YOU THINK

457
00:12:13,353 --> 00:12:14,492
YOU CAN BUY A HOUSE?

458
00:12:14,595 --> 00:12:15,907
>> I NEED TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH

459
00:12:16,011 --> 00:12:16,977
I CAN AFFORD,

460
00:12:17,081 --> 00:12:18,876
LIKE, BASED ON MY INCOME.

461
00:12:18,979 --> 00:12:21,154
>> WHEN YOU BUY A HOUSE, YOU'RE

462
00:12:21,257 --> 00:12:23,259
RESPONSIBLE FOR EVERYTHING.

463
00:12:23,363 --> 00:12:24,951
IT'S A LOT OF EXPENSE.

464
00:12:25,054 --> 00:12:25,848
>> AND THEN WE STRUGGLE

465
00:12:25,952 --> 00:12:29,300
AND NOT HAVE ANYTHING.

466
00:12:29,403 --> 00:12:31,060
MAYBE WE CAN FURTHER THINGS

467
00:12:31,164 --> 00:12:32,613
WHEN LANDON GETS HERE.

468
00:12:32,717 --> 00:12:33,614
>> TAKE OUT TIME

469
00:12:33,718 --> 00:12:35,893
TO THINK ABOUT IT.

470
00:12:35,996 --> 00:12:38,654
>> I DON'T KNOW.

471
00:12:42,451 --> 00:12:43,866
AFTER TALKING TO MY MOM,

472
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:45,074
COLIN AND I STARTED GETTING

473
00:12:45,178 --> 00:12:48,146
OUR ROOM READY FOR THE BABY.

474
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:48,768
>> WE NEED TO GO THROUGH

475
00:12:48,871 --> 00:12:50,114
THIS STUFF.

476
00:12:50,217 --> 00:12:51,840
>> BUT SPACE IS TIGHT.

477
00:12:51,943 --> 00:12:53,117
[bleep] SO UNORGANIZED,

478
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,843
IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY.

479
00:12:54,946 --> 00:12:55,844
AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

480
00:12:55,947 --> 00:12:57,397
EVEN MORE STUFF TO FIT IN

481
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:58,225
BECAUSE MY BABY SHOWER

482
00:12:58,329 --> 00:13:00,538
IS TOMORROW.

483
00:13:04,542 --> 00:13:05,129
[cheers and applause]

484
00:13:05,232 --> 00:13:09,236
>> HOW PRETTY.

485
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,099
>> OKAY, CAN I GET

486
00:13:10,203 --> 00:13:12,032
EVERYBODY'S ATTENTION?

487
00:13:12,136 --> 00:13:13,620
THE BELLY GAME.

488
00:13:13,723 --> 00:13:14,897
WE'RE GONNA TAKE THIS YARN

489
00:13:15,001 --> 00:13:17,451
AND CUT HOW BIG AROUND

490
00:13:17,555 --> 00:13:19,281
YOU THINK DEVON IS.

491
00:13:19,384 --> 00:13:20,109
>> I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA

492
00:13:20,213 --> 00:13:20,869
HAVE ENOUGH YARN

493
00:13:20,972 --> 00:13:21,559
FOR MY STOMACH--

494
00:13:21,662 --> 00:13:22,318
[laughter]

495
00:13:22,422 --> 00:13:24,838
'CAUSE THAT WOULD BE LONG.

496
00:13:24,942 --> 00:13:26,426
>> WHOOPS.

497
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:30,568
>> all: AWW.

498
00:13:30,671 --> 00:13:35,953
>> AH, HEART BREAKER.

499
00:13:36,056 --> 00:13:38,645
>> OOH, BREAST PADS.

500
00:13:38,748 --> 00:13:41,682
>> GONNA NEED THOSE.

501
00:13:41,786 --> 00:13:46,342
>> MM-HMM.

502
00:13:46,446 --> 00:13:47,136
>> YOU WANT TO SIT DOWN?

503
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:47,827
>> MM-HMM.

504
00:13:47,930 --> 00:13:52,279
>> OKAY.

505
00:13:52,383 --> 00:13:53,004
>> ARE YOU GONNA HAVE

506
00:13:53,108 --> 00:13:53,798
A NATURAL BIRTH?

507
00:13:53,902 --> 00:13:54,488
[laughter]

508
00:13:54,592 --> 00:13:56,249
>> WOULD YOU?

509
00:13:56,352 --> 00:13:57,181
>> I'M NOT PREGNANT.

510
00:13:57,284 --> 00:13:58,009
IT DON'T MATTER

511
00:13:58,113 --> 00:13:59,217
WHAT I'M GONNA [bleep] HAVE.

512
00:13:59,321 --> 00:14:01,323
>> I DON'T WANT TO FEEL A THING.

513
00:14:01,426 --> 00:14:02,255
I DON'T EVEN LIKE WHEN I GET

514
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:03,843
A LITTLE PAPER CUT.

515
00:14:03,946 --> 00:14:05,085
I FREAK OUT.

516
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:07,156
>> I FREAK OUT TOO.

517
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,192
>> ARE YOU SCARED?

518
00:14:08,295 --> 00:14:09,331
>> I MEAN, I'M NERVOUS,

519
00:14:09,434 --> 00:14:10,401
BUT WHAT CAN I DO?

520
00:14:10,504 --> 00:14:11,229
>> SO AS FAR AS, LIKE,

521
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,368
BABY STUFF GOES, LIKE,

522
00:14:12,472 --> 00:14:13,404
WHO'S GONNA BUY WHAT?

523
00:14:13,507 --> 00:14:15,130
LIKE, DIAPERS AND STUFF.

524
00:14:15,233 --> 00:14:16,200
>> HIM.

525
00:14:16,303 --> 00:14:18,512
[laughter]

526
00:14:18,616 --> 00:14:19,272
I MEAN, HE'S THE ONE

527
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:19,997
WITH THE JOB RIGHT NOW.

528
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:20,687
I CAN'T WORK RIGHT NOW.

529
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,896
>> YEAH.

530
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:27,728
>> COLIN'S BEEN WORKING

531
00:14:27,832 --> 00:14:29,144
AT THE WAREHOUSE JOB FULL-TIME.

532
00:14:29,247 --> 00:14:29,834
>> BYE, SWEETHEART.

533
00:14:29,938 --> 00:14:30,973
I LOVE YOU.

534
00:14:31,077 --> 00:14:35,736
>> LOVE YOU.

535
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,703
AND I'VE BEEN TRYING

536
00:14:36,806 --> 00:14:38,429
TO FOCUS ON SCHOOL,

537
00:14:38,532 --> 00:14:40,983
BUT IT'S BEEN A STRUGGLE.

538
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:42,260
I DIDN'T FEEL WELL DURING CLASS

539
00:14:42,364 --> 00:14:44,814
TODAY AND HAD TO GO HOME EARLY.

540
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:45,850
>> SO HOW WAS SCHOOL?

541
00:14:45,954 --> 00:14:47,334
>> I GOT SICK.

542
00:14:47,438 --> 00:14:48,577
I WAS JUST SITTING IN CLASS

543
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,268
AND FELT HOT ALL OF A SUDDEN,

544
00:14:50,372 --> 00:14:51,994
AND SO I JUST GOT UP, WENT

545
00:14:52,098 --> 00:14:53,582
TO THE BATHROOM, AND THREW UP.

546
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:54,307
I DON'T WANT TO DEAL

547
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:55,653
WITH SCHOOL RIGHT NOW.

548
00:14:55,756 --> 00:14:56,792
>> HOW DO PEOPLE REACT

549
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,828
TO YOU BEING PREGNANT?

550
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:00,554
>> HORRIBLY.

551
00:15:00,658 --> 00:15:01,521
I MEAN, I UNDERSTAND I GOT TO GO

552
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:02,902
TO SCHOOL, BUT I THINK

553
00:15:03,005 --> 00:15:04,248
I'M MIGHT JUST GET MY G.E.D.

554
00:15:04,351 --> 00:15:06,526
I THINK I CAN DO IT AT HOME

555
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:09,736
A LITTLE BETTER THAN GOING.

556
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,151
>> YOU DON'T WANT TO GRADUATE?

557
00:15:11,255 --> 00:15:14,499
>> I MEAN, I DO, BUT...

558
00:15:14,603 --> 00:15:15,569
I JUST CAN'T GO A WHOLE YEAR

559
00:15:15,673 --> 00:15:21,437
DOING THIS.

560
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:22,818
I'M BUMMED NOT TO GRADUATE

561
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,751
WITH MY FRIENDS, BUT I FEEL

562
00:15:24,854 --> 00:15:25,614
LIKE THIS IS THE ONLY WAY

563
00:15:25,717 --> 00:15:30,515

00:22:58,238 --> 00:22:59,826
[bleep] HELLACIOUS.

754
00:22:59,930 --> 00:23:01,000
I FEEL LIKE MY INSIDES

755
00:23:01,103 --> 00:23:03,520
ARE GONNA [bleep] FALL OUT.

756
00:23:03,623 --> 00:23:06,488
ALL THIS PAIN FOR YOU.

757
00:23:06,592 --> 00:23:09,008
>> HOME, SWEET, HOME.

758
00:23:09,111 --> 00:23:11,286
WELCOME HOME, BABY LANDON.

762
00:23:22,746 --> 00:23:25,024
SO ARE YOU READY FOR ALL THIS?

763
00:23:25,127 --> 00:23:26,094
>> YEAH.

764
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:29,269
>> LOOK AT HIM YAWNING.

765
00:23:37,761 --> 00:23:39,728
IT'S GREAT TO HAVE LANDON HOME,

766
00:23:39,832 --> 00:23:40,833
BUT COLIN HAS TO GO BACK

767
00:23:40,936 --> 00:23:42,973
TO HIS WAREHOUSE JOB TOMORROW.

768
00:23:43,076 --> 00:23:44,284
HE'S PICKING UP EXTRA SHIFTS

769
00:23:44,388 --> 00:23:46,010
TO SAVE MONEY, SO I'M NOT SURE

770
00:23:46,114 --> 00:23:47,046
IF I CAN RELY ON HIM

771
00:23:47,149 --> 00:23:48,634
FOR HELP DURING THE NIGHT.

772
00:23:48,737 --> 00:23:49,428
WHAT TIME DO YOU HAVE TO BE

773
00:23:49,531 --> 00:23:50,601
TO WORK TOMORROW?

774
00:23:50,705 --> 00:23:51,878

>> SO YOU HAVE TO WAKE UP

777
00:23:54,398 --> 00:23:56,504
AT LEAST ONCE TONIGHT.

778
00:23:56,607 --> 00:23:57,505
IS HIS DIAPER WET?

779
00:23:57,608 --> 00:23:59,127
YES.

780
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:02,924

GOOD NIGHT.

789
00:24:24,393 --> 00:24:25,774

>> WHILE COLIN'S AT WORK,

798
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:34,740
I'M IN THE HOUSE ALL DAY

799
00:25:34,843 --> 00:25:36,120
WITH THE BABY.

MY G.E.D. SINCE I'M PLANNING

803
00:25:41,298 --> 00:25:43,334
TO TAKE IT IN A FEW MONTHS,

804
00:25:43,438 --> 00:25:47,442
BUT IT'S BEEN REALLY HARD.

805
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,548
HERE I AM DOING THIS FOR YOU,

806
00:25:49,651 --> 00:25:50,687
AND YOU'RE MAKING IT SO HARD

807
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:53,621
TO CONCENTRATE.

808
00:25:53,724 --> 00:25:55,070
MY MOM AND SISTERS HELP ME

809
00:25:55,174 --> 00:25:56,313
WHENEVER THEY CAN.

00:25:57,832 --> 00:25:58,557
YEAH, TIP HIS HEAD BACK

813
00:25:58,660 --> 00:25:59,212
A LITTLE BIT,

814
00:25:59,316 --> 00:26:01,180
AND IT'LL STOP.

815
00:26:01,283 --> 00:26:02,388
>> AND THEN COLIN PITCHES IN

816
00:26:02,491 --> 00:26:05,115
WHEN HE'S HOME FROM WORK.

817
00:26:05,218 --> 00:26:06,357
I WOULD'VE BEEN DONE BY NOW.

818
00:26:06,461 --> 00:26:07,945
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

819
00:26:08,049 --> 00:26:09,257
>> LOOK, HE'S ALL SMILES.

820
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:10,948
DO YOU SEE THAT?

821
00:26:11,052 --> 00:26:12,294
>> WE'VE BEEN SO BUSY

822
00:26:12,398 --> 00:26:13,572
THAT WE HAVEN'T EVEN HAD TIME

823
00:26:13,675 --> 00:26:15,884
TO TALK ABOUT MOVING OUT.

824
00:26:15,988 --> 00:26:17,334
I'M GLAD TO HAVE THE SUPPORT,

825
00:26:17,437 --> 00:26:18,991
BUT NOW THAT LANDON'S HERE,

826
00:26:19,094 --> 00:26:23,167
SPACE IS EVEN TIGHTER.

827
00:26:23,271 --> 00:26:24,721
IT'D BE NICE IF I COULD, LIKE,

828
00:26:24,824 --> 00:26:26,274
USE MY CHANGING TABLE

829
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:27,275
AS A CHANGING TABLE

830
00:26:27,378 --> 00:26:29,449
AND NOT A DAMN STORAGE SPACE.

831
00:26:38,044 --> 00:26:41,082
YOU WANT TO CALL ALEXUS?

832
00:26:41,185 --> 00:26:43,291

00:27:03,345 --> 00:27:04,036
>> YEAH, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY

852
00:27:04,139 --> 00:27:05,382
GET ON THAT.

TO SAVE MONEY, IT'S BEEN

866
00:27:28,301 --> 00:27:29,578
EVEN MORE ANNOYING TO COME HOME

867
00:27:29,682 --> 00:27:31,373
TO A CROWDED HOUSE.

868
00:27:31,477 --> 00:27:32,823
SO TIRED OF CLEANING UP

869
00:27:32,927 --> 00:27:35,412
AFTER OTHER PEOPLE.

870
00:27:35,515 --> 00:27:36,240
JUST TOO MANY PEOPLE

871
00:27:36,344 --> 00:27:40,244
IN THE HOUSE.

[chime dings]

873
00:27:41,038 --> 00:27:42,281
THIS HOUSE WAS SMALL

874
00:27:42,384 --> 00:27:43,592
WHEN THERE WERE EIGHT OF US.

875
00:27:43,696 --> 00:27:45,180
NOW THAT THERE'S ANOTHER PERSON,

876
00:27:45,284 --> 00:27:46,595

00:27:46,699 --> 00:27:47,976
CLOTHES, AND BABY STUFF,

878
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,115
I'M STARTING TO FEEL LIKE

879

THE WALLS ARE CAVING IN ON ME.

880
00:28:00,333 --> 00:28:01,507
WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE.

881
00:28:01,610 --> 00:28:03,820
IT'S TOO CROWDED.

882
00:28:03,923 --> 00:28:05,269
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH ROOM

883
00:28:05,373 --> 00:28:07,271
FOR EVERYTHING WE HAVE.

884
00:28:07,375 --> 00:28:10,585

IT'S JUST A LOT.

894
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:25,358
I THINK WE SHOULD SEE

WITH ALL THE PRESSURE OF TRYING

00:32:39,267 --> 00:32:40,682
TO FIGURE OUT WHERE TO LIVE,

1045
00:32:40,786 --> 00:32:41,856
I HAVEN'T SEEN MY FRIENDS

1046
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:45,308

BUT IT FELT GOOD

1057
00:33:05,604 --> 00:33:06,708
'CAUSE I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING

1058
00:33:06,812 --> 00:33:07,571
WHILE I WAS PREGNANT.

1059
00:33:07,675 --> 00:33:08,469

AND DECORATE.

1078
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:36,221
>> WELL, JUST DON'T RUSH THINGS.

1079
00:33:36,324 --> 00:33:37,601
>> I'M NOT.

1080
00:33:37,705 --> 00:33:38,982
GIRL, IF YOU SAW THE SPACE THAT

AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE

1094
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:12,360
TO SAVE MONEY.

1102
00:34:30,965 --> 00:34:32,863
WHY?

1103
00:34:32,967 --> 00:34:35,038
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1104
00:34:43,874 --> 00:34:45,255
>> I MEAN, IT SUCKS BECAUSE

1105
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:46,498
WE WERE DOING EVERYTHING

1106
00:34:46,601 --> 00:34:48,534
ON OUR OWN

1107
00:34:48,638 --> 00:34:49,846
AND BUYING EVERYTHING

1108
00:34:49,949 --> 00:34:50,881
AND NOT DEPENDING

1109
00:34:50,985 --> 00:34:51,675
ON ANYBODY ELSE,

1110
00:34:51,779 --> 00:34:52,607
ABOUT TO GET OUR OWN HOUSE,

1111
00:34:52,711 --> 00:34:53,470
LIKE...

1112
00:34:53,574 --> 00:34:54,092
>> DID NOT WANT THIS TO HAPPEN

1113
00:34:54,195 --> 00:34:54,782
AT ALL.

1114
00:34:54,885 --> 00:34:55,817
>> BABY, NOBODY WANTS

1115
00:34:55,921 --> 00:34:57,647
TO LOSE THEIR JOB.

1116
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,993
>> LIKE, BEFORE HE WAS BORN,

1117
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,339
THIS WAS, LIKE, ONE OF MY

1118
00:35:00,443 --> 00:35:02,341
BIGGEST FEARS.

1119
00:35:02,445 --> 00:35:06,483
>> YEAH.

1120
00:35:06,587 --> 00:35:10,349
>> YOU'RE NOT FAILING.

1121

YOU'RE DOING THE BEST YOU CAN,

1122
00:35:11,557 --> 00:35:12,351

>> THIS SLOWED EVERYTHING DOWN.

1124
00:35:14,181 --> 00:35:17,529
DADDY'S SORRY, THOUGH.

1125
00:35:17,632 --> 00:35:21,774
HE'S GONNA DO WHATEVER HE CAN.

1126
00:35:34,891 --> 00:35:35,547
>> female announcer: DON'T

1127
00:35:35,650 --> 00:35:36,479
GO AWAY.

1128
00:35:36,582 --> 00:35:37,135
THIS EPISODE OF 16 AND PREGNANT

1129
00:35:37,238 --> 00:35:39,275
CONTINUES RIGHT NOW.

1130
00:35:41,242 --> 00:35:42,554
>> COLIN'S BEEN JOB HUNTING

1131
00:35:42,657 --> 00:35:44,314
FOR THE PAST TWO WEEKS,

1132
00:35:44,418 --> 00:35:44,935
BUT HE STILL HASN'T

1133
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:46,523
FOUND ANYTHING.

1134
00:35:46,627 --> 00:35:47,662
RE-ENLISTING FULL-TIME

1135
00:35:47,766 --> 00:35:49,630
IS AN OPTION, BUT FOR NOW,

1136
00:35:49,733 --> 00:35:52,184
HE'S LOOKING CLOSE TO HOME.

1137
00:35:52,288 --> 00:35:53,254
WE'RE GOING TO MEET WITH OUR

1138
00:35:53,358 --> 00:35:54,876
REALTOR TO SEE WHAT THIS MEANS

1139
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,119
FOR OUR MOVING PLANS.

1140
00:35:56,223 --> 00:35:57,016
>> NOW WE GOT TO TELL HIM

1141
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,156
THAT I LOST MY JOB.

1142
00:35:58,259 --> 00:35:59,053
HE'S GONNA BE LIKE, "YOU READY

1143
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:00,019
TO FILL OUT A CONTRACT?"

1144
00:36:00,123 --> 00:36:01,020
AND THEN THAT'S PROBABLY

1145
00:36:01,124 --> 00:36:02,539
WHEN I'M GONNA BE LIKE,

1146
00:36:02,643 --> 00:36:05,301
"WELL, HERE'S THE CATCH."

1147
00:36:05,404 --> 00:36:06,440
>> LIKE, IT JUST SUCKS.

1148
00:36:06,543 --> 00:36:07,682

AND NOW WE'RE TAKING--

1151
00:36:10,271 --> 00:36:10,858
HAVE TO TAKE ANOTHER ONE BACK.

1152
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:13,550
>> WELL--

1153
00:36:13,654 --> 00:36:15,897
IT SUCKS.

1154
00:36:16,001 --> 00:36:19,832
>> YEAH.

1155
00:36:27,668 --> 00:36:28,427
>> HEY, GUYS.

1156
00:36:28,531 --> 00:36:32,983
>> HELLO.

1157
00:36:33,087 --> 00:36:33,812
>> ALL RIGHT, SO

1158
00:36:33,915 --> 00:36:35,434
FIRST TIME LOOKING AT HOUSES.

1159
00:36:35,538 --> 00:36:36,297
>> YES.

1160
00:36:36,401 --> 00:36:37,436
>> SO WHAT WOULD YOUR CONCERNS

1161
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,783
BE AS FAR AS WRITING AN OFFER?

1162
00:36:39,887 --> 00:36:41,268
>> I WANT TO MOVE NOW, BUT...

1163
00:36:41,371 --> 00:36:44,029
>> MM-HMM.

1164
00:36:47,964 --> 00:36:49,828
>> COLIN LOST HIS JOB.

1165
00:36:49,931 --> 00:36:50,553
>> DID YOU REALLY?

1166
00:36:50,656 --> 00:36:51,692
>> YEAH, A COUPLE DAYS

1167
00:36:51,795 --> 00:36:53,418
AFTER WE TALKED WITH YOU,

1168
00:36:53,521 --> 00:36:54,729
I GOT LAID OFF.

1169
00:36:54,833 --> 00:36:56,421
>> I'M SO SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

1170
00:36:56,524 --> 00:36:59,217
>> YEAH.

1171
00:36:59,320 --> 00:36:59,941
IT SUCKS.

1172
00:37:00,045 --> 00:37:03,048
>> YEAH, I'M SORRY, MAN.

1173
00:37:03,151 --> 00:37:04,429
JUST TO BE FRANK WITH YOU GUYS,

1174
00:37:04,532 --> 00:37:05,395
THE FACT THAT YOU

1175
00:37:05,499 --> 00:37:06,845
DON'T HAVE A JOB--

1176
00:37:06,948 --> 00:37:08,156
YOU CAN'T SEARCH FOR HOUSES.

1177
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,675
>> YEAH.

1178
00:37:09,779 --> 00:37:11,574
>> NOW, IF I GOT A NEW JOB,

1179
00:37:11,677 --> 00:37:12,540
DON'T YOU HAVE TO HAVE--

1180
00:37:12,644 --> 00:37:13,645
>> TWO MONTHS.

1181
00:37:13,748 --> 00:37:14,749
>> TWO MONTHS WITH A JOB?

1182
00:37:14,853 --> 00:37:16,268
>> MM-HMM.

1183
00:37:16,372 --> 00:37:17,580
AND UNDERSTAND, YOU KNOW,

1184
00:37:17,683 --> 00:37:18,753
YOU GUYS GO THROUGH THINGS,

1185
00:37:18,857 --> 00:37:19,720
ESPECIALLY AS YOUNG AS YOU ARE,

1186
00:37:19,823 --> 00:37:21,135
BUT MY THING IS, I DON'T WANT

1187
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:21,963
TO WASTE YOUR TIME.

1188
00:37:22,067 --> 00:37:22,792
LIKE, I DON'T WANT TO SELL YOU

1189
00:37:22,895 --> 00:37:23,379
ON A DREAM, AND YOU CAN'T--

1190
00:37:23,482 --> 00:37:24,103
>> MM.

1191
00:37:24,207 --> 00:37:24,828
>> IT'S NOT FAIR FOR ME

1192
00:37:24,932 --> 00:37:25,519
TO DO THAT TO YOU.

1193
00:37:25,622 --> 00:37:28,936
>> YEAH.

1194
00:37:35,322 --> 00:37:36,564
COLIN'S BEEN OUT JOB HUNTING

1195
00:37:36,668 --> 00:37:38,186
EVERY DAY WHILE I'VE BEEN

1196
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:40,119
AT HOME WITH THE BABY.

1197
00:37:40,223 --> 00:37:41,397
EVEN THOUGH HE'S TRYING HIS

1198
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:43,053
BEST, THINGS HAVE NOT TURNED OUT

1199
00:37:43,157 --> 00:37:47,023
THE WAY I THOUGHT THEY WOULD.

1200
00:37:47,126 --> 00:37:48,611
LIKE A TRAIN WRECK

1201
00:37:48,714 --> 00:37:51,993
COMING THROUGH THE DAMN DOOR.

1202
00:37:52,097 --> 00:37:54,513
SO HOW DID JOB HUNTING GO?

1203
00:37:54,617 --> 00:37:57,413
>> UH, STILL NO JOB.

1204
00:37:57,516 --> 00:37:59,587
>> WHERE DID YOU APPLY TO?

1205
00:37:59,691 --> 00:38:00,623
>> I APPLIED FOR

1206
00:38:00,726 --> 00:38:01,658
A COUPLE WAREHOUSE JOBS

1207
00:38:01,762 --> 00:38:04,661
AND A SECURITY JOB.

1208
00:38:04,765 --> 00:38:06,525
WHAT DID YOU DO ALL DAY?

1209
00:38:06,629 --> 00:38:07,733
>> NOTHING.

1210
00:38:07,837 --> 00:38:11,737
JUST SAT HERE AND WATCHED HIM.

1211
00:38:11,841 --> 00:38:14,499
YOU NEED, LIKE, A STABLE JOB.

1212
00:38:14,602 --> 00:38:19,227
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR.

1213
00:38:19,331 --> 00:38:20,090
I'M EVEN CONSIDERING

1214
00:38:20,194 --> 00:38:21,609
GOING BACK TO SCHOOL.

1215
00:38:21,713 --> 00:38:23,542
>> FOR WHAT?

1216
00:38:23,646 --> 00:38:24,267
>> I THINK THEY HAVE

1217
00:38:24,371 --> 00:38:25,164
A FIRE SCIENCE PROGRAM,

1218
00:38:25,268 --> 00:38:26,545
AND I WAS THINKING ABOUT

1219
00:38:26,649 --> 00:38:29,721
DOING THAT TO BE A FIREFIGHTER.

1220
00:38:29,824 --> 00:38:30,756
>> CAN WE GET A HOUSE

1221
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:31,895
IF YOU'RE GOING TO SCHOOL?

1222
00:38:31,999 --> 00:38:32,965
>> NO.

1223
00:38:33,069 --> 00:38:34,622
>> OKAY, THEN.

1224
00:38:34,726 --> 00:38:38,281
I'D RATHER YOU FIND A JOB.

1225
00:38:38,385 --> 00:38:39,282
>> WHAT IF I WENT TO SCHOOL

1226
00:38:39,386 --> 00:38:42,630
AND GOT A JOB?

1227
00:38:42,734 --> 00:38:47,532
>> THEN YOU'D NEVER BE HOME.

1228
00:38:47,635 --> 00:38:48,843
AND THEN I WOULD HAVE TO DO

1229
00:38:48,947 --> 00:38:51,052
EVERYTHING BY MYSELF.

1230
00:38:51,156 --> 00:38:51,881
WELL, YOU JUST NEED

1231
00:38:51,984 --> 00:38:53,331
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU WANT,

1232
00:38:53,434 --> 00:38:54,953
AND YOU NEED TO DO IT QUICK.

1233
00:38:55,056 --> 00:38:55,954
>> WELL, I'M NOT TELLING YOU

1234
00:38:56,057 --> 00:38:56,886
THAT YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT

1235
00:38:56,989 --> 00:38:58,197
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO QUICK.

1236
00:38:58,301 --> 00:38:59,509
>> COLIN, I HAVE TO STAY HOME.

1237
00:38:59,613 --> 00:39:00,545
I HAVE TO WATCH THE BABY.

1238
00:39:00,648 --> 00:39:01,408
I HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL.

1239
00:39:01,511 --> 00:39:02,512
I HAVE TO FINISH HIGH SCHOOL.

1240
00:39:02,616 --> 00:39:04,480
YOU'RE DONE WITH HIGH SCHOOL.

1241
00:39:04,583 --> 00:39:05,343
YOU NEED TO--

1242
00:39:05,446 --> 00:39:06,171
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT NEEDS TO GO

1243
00:39:06,274 --> 00:39:06,930
OUT THERE AND MAKE THE MONEY

1244
00:39:07,034 --> 00:39:09,347
FOR RIGHT NOW UNTIL I CAN.

1245
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:11,625
>> THERE'S ALWAYS DEPLOYMENTS

1246
00:39:11,728 --> 00:39:14,317
I CAN GO ON.

1247
00:39:14,421 --> 00:39:15,249
>> AND WHAT IS THAT HELPING?

1248
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,631
>> I COULD GO TO AFGHANISTAN.

1249
00:39:17,734 --> 00:39:19,633
YOU GET MONEY, GOOD MONEY.

1250
00:39:19,736 --> 00:39:20,427
>> YEAH.

1251
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:21,255
>> I REALLY DON'T WANT TO

1252
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,777
RELOCATE, BUT IT'S AN OPTION.

1253
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,916
>> WHEN COLIN LOST HIS JOB,

1254
00:39:27,019 --> 00:39:29,228
I MEAN, I WAS DISAPPOINTED

1255
00:39:29,332 --> 00:39:30,160
'CAUSE WE WERE READY

1256
00:39:30,264 --> 00:39:31,714
TO HAVE MORE SPACE FOR LANDON.

1257
00:39:31,817 --> 00:39:33,163
BUT THINGS HAPPEN.

1258
00:39:33,267 --> 00:39:34,095
HE LOST IT.

1259
00:39:34,199 --> 00:39:35,338
>> APPLYING TO JOBS ALL DAY

1260
00:39:35,442 --> 00:39:36,960
GETS FRUSTRATING.

1261
00:39:37,064 --> 00:39:38,237
>> YEAH.

1262
00:39:38,341 --> 00:39:39,204
SO WE'RE JUST KIND OF TRYING TO

1263
00:39:39,307 --> 00:39:40,792
PICK BACK UP THE PIECES AND,

1264
00:39:40,895 --> 00:39:43,173
LIKE, GET FINANCIALLY STABLE,

1265
00:39:43,277 --> 00:39:45,900
GET A HOUSE, AND JUST KIND OF GO

1266
00:39:46,004 --> 00:39:47,108
BACK TO WHERE WE WANTED TO,

1267
00:39:47,212 --> 00:39:49,421
LIKE, IN THE BEGINNING.

1268
00:39:49,525 --> 00:39:50,871
IT'S NOT FUN HAVING A KID AND

1269
00:39:50,974 --> 00:39:52,804
LIVING AT YOUR PARENT'S HOUSE.

1270
00:39:52,907 --> 00:39:53,529
>> IF WE MOVE THE BED

1271
00:39:53,632 --> 00:39:54,737
LIKE YOUR DAD SAID,

1272
00:39:54,840 --> 00:39:55,876
DO YOU WANT TO DO THAT?

1273
00:39:55,979 --> 00:39:58,050
>> NOT REALLY.

1274
00:39:58,154 --> 00:40:00,121
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WOULD DO

1275
00:40:00,225 --> 00:40:00,950
WITHOUT COLIN.

1276
00:40:01,053 --> 00:40:04,091
>> [babbling]

1277

>> HE'S ALWAYS THERE FOR ME

1278
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,818
AND FOR HIM.

1279
00:40:06,921 --> 00:40:09,337
I MEAN, IT SUCKS KNOWING

1280
00:40:09,441 --> 00:40:12,375
THAT COLIN COULD GO ACTIVE DUTY.

1281
00:40:12,479 --> 00:40:13,238
>> WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING

1282
00:40:13,341 --> 00:40:14,653
BIGGER AND BETTER.

1283
00:40:14,757 --> 00:40:15,896
>> I MEAN, IT'S NOT SOMETHING

1284
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:17,656
THAT I WANT.

1285
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,657
YOU'RE ALWAYS GONNA

1286
00:40:18,761 --> 00:40:19,451
MAKE SACRIFICES

1287
00:40:19,555 --> 00:40:20,521
WHEN YOU'RE A TEEN MOM.

1288
00:40:20,625 --> 00:40:22,040
I'M MISSING OUT ON PROM.

1289
00:40:22,143 --> 00:40:23,144
LIKE, I'M MISSING OUT ON SENIOR

1290
00:40:23,248 --> 00:40:24,801
YEAR, GRADUATING WITH MY CLASS,

1291
00:40:24,905 --> 00:40:26,734
SO I'M GETTING MY G.E.D.

1292
00:40:26,838 --> 00:40:28,218
TO GO TO COLLEGE FOR MY SON,

1293

AND THAT'S ALL.

1294

>> I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE, LIKE,

1295
00:40:30,462 --> 00:40:31,843
MOVING SO FAST 'CAUSE, LIKE,

00:40:31,946 --> 00:40:33,120
YOU'RE SO YOUNG, AND YOU, LIKE,

00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:34,639
ALREADY HAVE YOUR LITTLE FAMILY.

1298
00:40:34,742 --> 00:40:36,330
>> YEAH, IT'S A LOT TO TAKE IN.

1299
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:37,124
TRUST ME.

1300

WHAT I'M GONNA WEAR TO PROM

1302
00:40:40,127 --> 00:40:43,337
OR HOW TAN I'M GONNA BE.

>> JUST HAVING TO GROW UP.

1304
00:40:46,133 --> 00:40:47,893
I JUST MISS, LIKE, BEING ABLE

1305
00:40:47,997 --> 00:40:50,724
TO JUST BE A TEENAGER.

1306
00:40:50,827 --> 00:40:53,830
IT'S DEFINITELY HARD.

00:41:19,131 --> 00:41:20,754

WHAT'S THE POINT FOR GOD

LETTING YOU FIND SOMEBODY

1311
00:41:24,102 --> 00:41:25,655

1313
00:41:26,863 --> 00:41:27,899
