"HEY."

385
00:11:06,466 --> 00:11:07,868
THE SHOWER'S TOMORROW.

386
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:10,470
I WISH YOU'D COME.

387
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,338
WELL.

OF MY BABY SHOWER,

394
00:11:24,384 --> 00:11:25,318
BUT I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING

395
00:11:25,318 --> 00:11:26,586
TO WEAR.

396
00:11:26,586 --> 00:11:27,620
>> I DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S SUCH

397
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,756
A BIG DEAL.

398
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:30,323
UM, THIS IS PRETTY.

00:11:48,241 --> 00:11:49,843
IS THAT GONNA BE WEIRD FOR YOU?

412
00:11:49,843 --> 00:11:51,078
>> NO, WHY?

413
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:52,946

EVEN REALLY TOGETHER AT ALL.

481
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:51,731
I THINK IT WAS MORE OF A--

482
00:13:51,731 --> 00:13:53,700
LIKE A ONE NIGHT STAND THING.

483
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:57,670
AND THEN HE WAS NEVER AROUND.

>> BUT IT'S A HOUSE.

572
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,452
I MEAN, IT'S NOT AN APARTMENT.

573
00:16:25,452 --> 00:16:26,286
THE BABY WOULD HAVE

574
00:16:26,286 --> 00:16:27,320
ITS OWN ROOM.

575
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,221

>> IT'S GONNA BE SCARY.

594
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:55,948
IT'S REAL SCARY, WHITNEY,

595
00:16:55,948 --> 00:16:57,684

596
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:58,851

NOW, TELL ME HOW MANY HOURS

615
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,513
A WEEK DO YOU WORK?

616

A WEEK OFF EVERY MONTH.

618
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:31,651

REALISTICALLY,

630
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:55,175
THIS MAY BE STRETCHING IT.

631
00:17:55,175 --> 00:17:57,009
YOU MAY WANT TO JUST SEE

00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:20,467
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

641

I KNOW.

642
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:27,340
I WISH I KNEW MORE ABOUT

651
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:45,358
WE THINK WE CAN AFFORD AND...

652
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:46,659
>> THEY SAID IT WOULD PROBABLY

653
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:49,329
BE BEST IF WE WAITED, THOUGH.

654
00:18:49,329 --> 00:18:53,666
>> WELL, I HAVE SOME BAD NEWS,

ANOTHER BOMB ON YOU,

657
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,475
BUT I TALKED TO THE LANDLORD

658
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:07,380
TODAY.

659
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:11,184
HE'S SELLING THIS HOUSE,

660
00:19:11,184 --> 00:19:13,186
AND I ASKED HIM HOW MUCH TIME

661
00:19:13,186 --> 00:19:16,623
WE HAVE BEFORE WE HAD TO MOVE,

662
00:19:16,623 --> 00:19:19,926
AND HE SAID FOR ME

663
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:23,196
TO START PREPARING NOW.

664
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:25,097

665
00:19:25,097 --> 00:19:26,799
HAVE NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.

666
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,202
>> I TRIED TO TALK TO HIM.

667
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:29,969
IT DIDN'T WORK.

668
00:19:29,969 --> 00:19:31,003
>> WELL, WHY WOULD HE PICK

669
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,405
RIGHT NOW?

670
00:19:32,405 --> 00:19:33,940
>> WELL, FOR ONE THING--

671
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,275
>> HE CAN'T WAIT?

672
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:38,345
HE CAN'T WAIT A MONTH OR TWO?

673
00:19:38,345 --> 00:19:39,679
>> WHITNEY, THE HOUSE MAY NOT

674
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,581

948
00:28:05,952 --> 00:28:06,853
I SPENT THE NIGHT IN THE

950
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:12,124
PITOCIN TO INDUCE MY LABOR.

951
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:14,126

WASN'T GETTING ENOUGH OXYGEN.

958
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:31,911
SO I HAD TO HAVE A C-SECTION.

959
00:28:31,911 --> 00:28:33,012
AND I DON'T REMEMBER MUCH

960
00:28:33,012 --> 00:28:34,814

THERE'S TWO BEDROOMS

1145
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:56,928
AND A BATHROOM.

1146
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,630
