1
00:00:03,567 --> 00:00:05,300
>> I'M NOT A SQUARE.

2
00:00:05,300 --> 00:00:06,533
>> [laughs]

3
00:00:06,533 --> 00:00:08,167
>> [laughs]

4
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:08,900
I'M JAZMIN.

5
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:10,600
I'M 17, AND I'M FROM RAYTOWN,

6
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:11,433
MISSOURI.

7
00:00:11,433 --> 00:00:12,967
I'M IN MY SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH

8
00:00:12,967 --> 00:00:14,367
SCHOOL, AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD

9
00:00:14,367 --> 00:00:15,600
TO GRADUATING AND STARTING

10
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,933
COLLEGE.

11
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:19,233
I LIVE WITH MY MOM, STEP DAD,

12
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:20,500
AND YOUNGER BROTHER, XAVIER.

13
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,067
>> WE GOT TWO DIFFERENT PEPPERS.

14
00:00:22,067 --> 00:00:23,367
>> THEY'RE THE SAME SHAPE.

15
00:00:23,367 --> 00:00:24,900
I'M REALLY CLOSE WITH MY MOM,

16
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,567
BUT MY PARENTS ARE SUPER STRICT,

17
00:00:26,567 --> 00:00:27,500
ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO

18
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:28,233
DATING.

19
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:30,000
>> DON'T PLAY HOUSE.

20
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,667
LIVE REALITY.

21
00:00:31,667 --> 00:00:32,733
>> I MET MY BOYFRIEND, DELL,

22
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:33,733
ALMOST A YEAR AGO,

23
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,400
AND HE ONLY LIVES A BLOCK AWAY.

24
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,467
BUT WE COULDN'T GO ON DATES

25
00:00:36,467 --> 00:00:38,200
UNTIL MY PARENTS APPROVED.

26
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,267
>> MAKE YOUR MOVE.

27
00:00:39,267 --> 00:00:40,067
THAT ONE WORKS.

28
00:00:40,067 --> 00:00:41,167
>> [laughs]

29
00:00:41,167 --> 00:00:43,100
AND EVEN THEN, THEY SET VERY

30
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,100
INTENSE HOUSE RULES...

31
00:00:50,633 --> 00:00:54,167
WHICH WE FAILED TO FOLLOW.

32
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:55,967
AND NOW I'M PREGNANT.

33
00:00:55,967 --> 00:00:57,967
[chime dings]

34
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,133
DELL AND I MET ONLINE, AND WE

35
00:01:04,133 --> 00:01:05,600
ONLY KNEW EACH OTHER FOR THREE

36
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,733
MONTHS WHEN I GOT PREGNANT WITH

37
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,167
OUR DAUGHTER, LAILA...

38
00:01:08,167 --> 00:01:08,933
>> LOVE YOU.

39
00:01:08,933 --> 00:01:10,067
>> YEAH, I LOVE YOU TOO.

40
00:01:10,067 --> 00:01:12,467
BUT WE IMMEDIATELY HIT IT OFF,

41
00:01:12,467 --> 00:01:13,733
AND WE LOVE SPENDING ALL OUR

42
00:01:13,733 --> 00:01:15,400
FREE TIME TOGETHER.

43
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:16,533
WE WANT TO GET OUR OWN PLACE

44
00:01:16,533 --> 00:01:18,233
ONCE THE BABY COMES, BUT DELL

45
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:19,767
NEEDS TO FIND A JOB FIRST.

46
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:20,767
HELP.

47
00:01:20,767 --> 00:01:21,600
>> NEED HELP GETTING UP THERE?

48
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:23,600
>> YES.

49
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:26,567
WHAT'D YOU THINK WHEN WE FIRST

50
00:01:26,567 --> 00:01:27,167
MET?

51
00:01:27,167 --> 00:01:29,167
LIKE, THE VERY FIRST TIME.

52
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:31,300
FOR A WHILE.

53
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,333
>> WILL YOU HELP...

54
00:01:32,333 --> 00:01:33,067
[laughs]

55
00:01:33,067 --> 00:01:33,967
I CAN'T FIGURE OUT IF YOU TRYING

56
00:01:33,967 --> 00:01:36,333
TO BE AN INSULT OR WHAT.

57
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:38,333
DON'T START WITH ME.

58
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:39,233
>> YOU WASN'T EVEN SHY OR

59
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:40,200
NERVOUS OR NONE OF THAT.

60
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,233
>> YOU WERE SHY.

61
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:42,067
YOU WAS NERVOUS.

62
00:01:42,067 --> 00:01:44,700
YOU WERE SHAKING.

63
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,767
YEAH, YOU ARE GONNA TALK TO ME.

64
00:01:45,767 --> 00:01:46,533
YOU'RE GONNA TALK TO ME.

65
00:01:46,533 --> 00:01:47,267
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO

66
00:01:47,267 --> 00:01:47,833
TALK TO ME.

67
00:01:47,833 --> 00:01:49,333
>> I DO.

68
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,467
>> [laughs]

69
00:01:51,467 --> 00:01:52,500
OKAY.

70
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,067
SO WITH THE WHOLE PREGNANCY

71
00:01:54,067 --> 00:01:56,067
THING, HOW'D YOU FEEL?

72
00:01:56,067 --> 00:01:56,700
>> I WAS NERVOUS.

73
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,700
I WAS SCARED.

74
00:02:02,467 --> 00:02:03,133
>> I UNDERSTAND THEY

75
00:02:03,133 --> 00:02:04,933
GRANDPARENTS AND WE YOUNG,

76
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:05,800
BUT THEY DON'T NEED TO METER

77
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,833
OUR EVERY MOVE.

78
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:08,067
LIKE, WHEN WE DO GET OUR OWN

79
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:09,600
PLACE, I MEAN, YOU DON'T HAVE

80
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,600
THE ADDED WORRY.

81
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,467
THAT'S WHY I WANT TO MOVE IN

82
00:02:11,467 --> 00:02:14,333
TOGETHER.

83
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,600
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?

84
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:17,833
>> [laughs]

85
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,067
STOP MAKING THAT FACE.

86
00:02:19,067 --> 00:02:19,867
YOU KNOW I CAN'T TAKE YOU

87
00:02:19,867 --> 00:02:20,833
SERIOUSLY.

88
00:02:20,833 --> 00:02:22,833
AS LONG AS SHE'S TAKEN CARE OF.

89
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:30,533
I DON'T WANT TO SIT HERE.

90
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:31,267
I WANT TO SIT THERE.

91
00:02:31,267 --> 00:02:32,167
>> THAT'S WHAT'S NOT GONNA

92
00:02:32,167 --> 00:02:32,733
HAPPEN.

93
00:02:32,733 --> 00:02:33,633
>> THAT'S THE QUEEN'S CHAIR.

94
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:34,300
[laughs]

95
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,767
>> YOU CAN SIT RIGHT THERE.

96
00:02:35,767 --> 00:02:36,900
ALL RIGHT, WHO'S BLESSING THE

97
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,067
FOOD?

98
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:40,267
>> TEESHA MILLER.

99
00:02:40,267 --> 00:02:41,067
>> FATHER GOD IN HEAVEN,

100
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:42,700
WE THANK YOU FOR THIS DAY, LORD.

101
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,233
BLESS US AS WE TAKE THE FOOD.

102
00:02:44,233 --> 00:02:46,567
AMEN.

103
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:47,233
>> PASS 'EM.

104
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:47,900
>> THANK YOU.

105
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,700
I LIKE THE WAY YOU JUST HANDED

106
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,333
THOSE KNIVES TO ME.

107
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,267
I THINK I'M MODERATELY WORRIED

108
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:53,200
THAT YOU'RE NOT GONNA FULFILL

109
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,933
YOUR POTENTIAL BY HAVING A BABY.

110
00:02:54,933 --> 00:02:57,067
A PART OF ME WONDERS IF YOU'LL

111
00:02:57,067 --> 00:02:59,800
BE ABLE TO MAKE THE JUMP IN

112
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,167
MATURITY TO SAY, "THIS IS WHAT

113
00:03:02,167 --> 00:03:05,167
MY HEART SAYS OR MY BODY FEELS,

114
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:07,900
BUT HOW WILL THIS IMPACT MY LIFE

115
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:08,900
IN THE LONG RUN?"

116
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,867
>> I'M JUST GONNA DEAL WITH IT.

117
00:03:09,867 --> 00:03:10,767
>> YOU'RE JUST GONNA DEAL WITH

118
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:11,367
IT?

119
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:12,067
>> YEAH.

120
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:12,700
>> OKAY.

121
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,833
DID YOUR COUNSELOR AND THE

122
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,533
PRINCIPAL AGREE THAT YOU WILL

123
00:03:15,533 --> 00:03:17,367
ACTUALLY STILL GRADUATE IN

124
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:18,133
DECEMBER?

125
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:18,800
>> YEAH.

126
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,133
I'M GONNA DO ONLINE.

127
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:21,067
>> IT DOESN'T COME WITHOUT

128
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,267
SACRIFICE.

129
00:03:22,267 --> 00:03:24,533
ARE YOU AT ALL WORRIED ABOUT HOW

130
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:26,400
THIS IS GONNA CHANGE YOUR LIFE?

131
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,533
>> NO.

132
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:28,767
I FIGURE I'LL MAKE IT HAPPEN.

133
00:03:28,767 --> 00:03:30,567
>> I DO PRAY IT WORKS OUT,

134
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:32,133
NOT FOR YOUR SAKE SO MUCH,

135
00:03:32,133 --> 00:03:34,200
BUT FOR LAILA'S SAKE.

136
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,667
BUT I WAS HUGELY DISAPPOINTED.

137
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:41,200
>> MAJOR, MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT.

138
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,133
IT JUST HURT.

139
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:44,167
EVERYTHING CHANGED, AND THEN

140
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:46,133
WORRYING ABOUT YOU AND DELL

141
00:03:46,133 --> 00:03:47,767
BEING SO YOUNG.

142
00:03:47,767 --> 00:03:49,067
>> I CAN LOOK YOU IN YOUR EYES

143
00:03:49,067 --> 00:03:50,067
AND TELL YOU THAT YOU HAVE NO

144
00:03:50,067 --> 00:03:51,967
IDEA--NO IDEA WHAT

145
00:03:51,967 --> 00:03:53,967
YOU'RE IN FOR.

146
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:06,767
>> IT SUCKS HOW UPSET MY PARENTS

147
00:04:06,767 --> 00:04:08,200
ARE, AND I REALLY WANT TO PROVE

148
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,700
THEM WRONG BY STAYING ON TOP OF

149
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,367
MY ONLINE SCHOOLWORK.

150
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:12,633
BUT I MISS SEEING MY FRIENDS

151
00:04:12,633 --> 00:04:15,067
EVERY DAY.

152
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:15,867
>> DO YOU GUYS HAVE STRAWBERRY

153
00:04:15,867 --> 00:04:16,533
SMOOTHIES?

154
00:04:16,533 --> 00:04:17,267
>> YEAH. FOR YOU?

155
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:19,267
>> STRAWBERRY BANANA.

156
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,067
>> HERE'S YOUR STRAWBERRY

157
00:04:22,067 --> 00:04:22,767
SMOOTHIE FOR YA.

158
00:04:22,767 --> 00:04:24,667
>> THANK YOU.

159
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:27,700
GOD, OF COURSE YOU DO.

160
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,800
>> I REMEMBER HOW I TOLD YOU

161
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,467
WHEN I WAS PREGNANT.

162
00:04:29,467 --> 00:04:30,133
DO YOU REMEMBER?

163
00:04:30,133 --> 00:04:31,400
AND YOU WERE LIKE, "OH, MY GOSH,

164
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,067
NO!"

165
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:32,967
>> LIKE, 'CAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS

166
00:04:32,967 --> 00:04:33,600
A JOKE.

167
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,267
LIKE, WHO SAYS THAT?

168
00:04:34,267 --> 00:04:34,933
>> RIGHT.

169
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:35,733
>> LIKE, I JUST HUNG OUT WITH

170
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:36,367
YOU LAST WEEKEND.

171
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:37,500
YOU DIDN'T LOOK PREGNANT THEN.

172
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:38,667
LIKE...

173
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:40,100
DID YOU KNOW THAT PREGNANCY WAS

174
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:41,267
A POSSIBILITY?

175
00:04:41,267 --> 00:04:42,300
>> YEAH, BUT LIKE I SAID, IT WAS

176
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,067
KIND OF LIKE A RATIO TYPE

177
00:04:43,067 --> 00:04:43,633
OF THING.

178
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:44,400
LIKE, YOU THINK, LIKE, "NO,

179
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,533
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN TO ME."

180
00:04:45,533 --> 00:04:46,800
AND I THOUGHT BIRTH CONTROL JUST

181
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,733
MADE YOU FAT.

182
00:04:47,733 --> 00:04:49,267
WHICH I ENDED UP FAT ANYWAY.

183
00:04:49,267 --> 00:04:51,167
>> OKAY, BUT...

184
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:52,067
>> THEN I HEARD ONE MAKES YOU

185
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:53,167
LOSE YOUR HAIR, AND I WAS JUST

186
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:53,967
LIKE, "OKAY, IT'S JUST"--

187
00:04:53,967 --> 00:04:54,900
>> LOSE YOUR HAIR?

188
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:55,600
>> YEAH.

189
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,633
>> WELL, I MEAN, WE'RE GIFTED

190
00:04:57,633 --> 00:04:58,567
WITH HAIR STORES.

191
00:04:58,567 --> 00:04:59,433
I MEAN, IF YOU LOSE YOUR HAIR...

192
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:00,533
>> SHUT UP.

193
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:01,933
>> GO BUY SOME MORE.

194
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:04,567
[laughs]

195
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:05,800
WITH YOU LEAVING SCHOOL EARLY

196
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,067
AND EVERYTHING, IT'S LIKE WE'RE

197
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:08,667
STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL LIVING HIGH

198
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:10,133
SCHOOL LIFE, AND YOU'RE, LIKE,

199
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:11,300
GROWN.

200
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,200
>> I THINK IT'LL BE REAL WHEN

201
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,067
YOU GUYS ACTUALLY DO GO TO

202
00:05:13,067 --> 00:05:14,500
COLLEGE, 'CAUSE THEN I'LL BE

203
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,167
SITTING HERE.

204
00:05:15,167 --> 00:05:16,600
>> YEAH, WE'LL BE POSTING

205
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,367
PICTURES ON INSTAGRAM, PARTYING.

206
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:19,200
>> AND I THOUGHT I WAS HAVING,

207
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,733
LIKE, THE SAME PATH AND THE SAME

208
00:05:20,733 --> 00:05:21,633
KIND OF, LIKE, LIFESTYLE.

209
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:24,133
WE'RE KIND OF STAGGERED NOW.

210
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:25,433
YEAH, I WAS GONNA GO TO SCHOOL.

211
00:05:25,433 --> 00:05:27,433
>> FOR WHAT, THOUGH?

212
00:05:29,233 --> 00:05:30,100
>> PLAY WITH BLOOD?

213
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:30,933
>> YEAH.

214
00:05:30,933 --> 00:05:32,100
>> SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO NOW?

215
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:32,967
>> WE'LL SEE.

216
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:33,900
>> DO YOU THINK YOU AND DELL

217
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:34,933
WILL BE TOGETHER FOR, LIKE,

218
00:05:34,933 --> 00:05:35,633
EVER?

219
00:05:35,633 --> 00:05:36,567
>> OH, YEAH.

220
00:05:36,567 --> 00:05:37,767
WE JUST HAVE TO FIND THAT MIDDLE

221
00:05:37,767 --> 00:05:39,333
GROUND WHERE WE CAN BOTH GO TO

222
00:05:39,333 --> 00:05:40,633
SCHOOL, HAVE A JOB,

223
00:05:40,633 --> 00:05:42,700
YOU KNOW, BE COMFORTABLE,

224
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,700
AND HOPEFULLY MOVE IN TOGETHER.

225
00:05:49,967 --> 00:05:51,567
WHEN I GOT HOME, I FOUND OUT

226
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:53,533
DELL GOT A JOB.

227
00:05:53,533 --> 00:05:54,933
I'M REALLY EXCITED, BECAUSE THIS

228
00:05:54,933 --> 00:05:55,967
IS A STEP CLOSER TO US GETTING

229
00:05:55,967 --> 00:05:57,667
OUR OWN PLACE.

230
00:05:57,667 --> 00:05:59,067
MY PARENTS WANTED TO TALK TO US

231
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,433
TODAY ABOUT OUR PLANS,

232
00:06:00,433 --> 00:06:02,067
AND I HOPE THEY AGREE WITH WHAT

233
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:03,067
WE'RE THINKING.

234
00:06:03,067 --> 00:06:03,833
>> HI, EVERYBODY.

235
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:05,067
>> HEY, WHAT'S UP, DELL?

236
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:06,200
>> IT'S B-RAD.

237
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:06,867
>> HAVE A SEAT.

238
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,633
LET'S TALK FOR A SECOND.

239
00:06:09,633 --> 00:06:11,600
>> WHAT KIND OF PLANS DO Y'ALL

240
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:13,700
GOT, AS FAR AS, LIKE, STICKING

241
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:14,367
MONEY TO THE SIDE

242
00:06:14,367 --> 00:06:16,367
FOR EMERGENCIES, OR...

243
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:22,167
>> AND INCOME IS JUST A QUARTER

244
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:23,667
OF THE BATTLE, 'CAUSE THE REST

245
00:06:23,667 --> 00:06:26,100
OF THE BATTLE IS HAVING BENEFITS

246
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,267
AND HAVING A CAREER PATH,

247
00:06:29,267 --> 00:06:30,600
A LADDER.

248
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,800
>> ME NOT HAVING A JOB AS LONG

249
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,167
AS I DID, I COULDN'T CONTROL

250
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:33,967
THAT.

251
00:06:33,967 --> 00:06:34,700
>> DISAGREE WITH THAT ONE,

252
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,967
BROTHER.

253
00:06:36,967 --> 00:06:39,067
SO WHAT'S THE PLAN FOR WHEN THE

254
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:39,767
BABY'S BORN?

255
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:41,067
WHERE'S--

256
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:42,900
YOU KNOW, HOW IS THIS ALL GONNA

257
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,733
WORK OUT?

258
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:44,667
>> SOMETHING THAT I WAS THINKING

259
00:06:44,667 --> 00:06:45,600
ABOUT IS SOMETHING THAT MY DAD

260
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,367
HAS PREACHED TO ME.

261
00:06:46,367 --> 00:06:47,633
HE SAID WHEN I HAD KIDS,

262
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:48,967
I WAS OUT OF MY PARENT'S HOUSE.

263
00:06:48,967 --> 00:06:50,233
AND SO FOR ME, I FEEL LIKE

264
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:51,100
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I NEED

265
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:51,767
TO DO.

266
00:06:51,767 --> 00:06:53,200
>> I THINK THAT'S COMMENDABLE.

267
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,067
BUT IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

268
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:55,633
LIVING TOGETHER, YOU KNOW,

269
00:06:55,633 --> 00:06:57,433
I SHOULD BE REAL CLEAR WITH YOU

270
00:06:57,433 --> 00:06:58,233
THAT THAT'S NOT SOMETHING

271
00:06:58,233 --> 00:06:58,967
I SUPPORT.

272
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:00,567
>> FOR A MYRIAD OF REASONS.

273
00:07:00,567 --> 00:07:02,200
YOU MOVE IN TOGETHER, AND YOU

274
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,233
DON'T EVEN HAVE A BASIC

275
00:07:03,233 --> 00:07:04,633
UNDERSTANDING, AND YOU REALLY

276
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:07,500
DON'T KNOW ONE ANOTHER.

277
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,900
THAT'S JUST A RECIPE FOR

278
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,767
DISASTER.

279
00:07:09,767 --> 00:07:10,633
>> SO I THINK WE SHOULD JUST BE

280
00:07:10,633 --> 00:07:13,133
CLEAR, YOU KNOW, FOR YOU ALL'S

281
00:07:13,133 --> 00:07:15,600
SAKE, WHEN BABY LAILA COMES,

282
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,400
OUR HOUSE HAS NOT CHANGED.

283
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,667
>> THERE ARE CONSEQUENCES FOR

284
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:19,900
EVERYTHING THAT WE DO.

285
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:21,667
>> YOU KNOW, THERE ARE RULES ON

286
00:07:21,667 --> 00:07:22,700
HOW YOU CAN DATE HER.

287
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:23,400
>> MM-HMM.

288
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,933
>> SO A PART OF MY REACTION TO

289
00:07:25,933 --> 00:07:27,400
THE PREGNANCY IS THAT THERE

290
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,233
OBVIOUSLY HAVE BEEN SOME

291
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:32,167
DECEPTION AND DISOBEDIENCE

292
00:07:32,167 --> 00:07:34,133
TO THE RULES.

293
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:37,633
JAZMIN, YOU HAD REALLY

294
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:40,100
ESTABLISHED YOURSELF AS A

295
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:41,900
TRUSTWORTHY CHILD, YOU KNOW,

296
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,867
SOMEONE WHO HAD GREAT POTENTIAL,

297
00:07:44,867 --> 00:07:47,700
SO YOU HAD EARNED JUST A LEVEL

298
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,933
OF TRUST IN OUR HEARTS THAT THIS

299
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:53,700
WAS DEFINITELY A GREAT BLOW TO.

300
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:09,700
>> I'M BUMMED MY PARENTS WON'T

301
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,067
LET US GET OUR OWN PLACE,

302
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:12,633
AND I HATE THAT I LET THEM DOWN,

303
00:08:12,633 --> 00:08:14,433
BUT I REALLY HOPE THEY'LL RELAX

304
00:08:14,433 --> 00:08:15,733
THE HOUSE RULES ONCE LAILA

305
00:08:15,733 --> 00:08:18,667
COMES.

306
00:08:18,667 --> 00:08:19,500
HI, DELL.

307
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,067
>> HELLO, JAZMIN.

308
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:24,067
>> I'M HUNGRY.

309
00:08:24,067 --> 00:08:25,467
I JUST WANT TO SHOW MY PARENTS

310
00:08:25,467 --> 00:08:26,767
THAT DELL AND I ARE TAKING THEM

311
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:27,833
SERIOUSLY.

312
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,133
>> MISS ME?

313
00:08:30,133 --> 00:08:32,133
>> YOU GONNA EAT THAT MANY EGGS?

314
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,333
>> THERE'S THREE OVER HERE.

315
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:36,200
>> YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

316
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,133
THREE PEOPLE.

317
00:08:37,133 --> 00:08:39,233
>> SHE DON'T WANT NO EGGS.

318
00:08:39,233 --> 00:08:40,267
ARE YOU COMING TO THE DOCTOR'S

319
00:08:40,267 --> 00:08:40,967
APPOINTMENT TOMORROW?

320
00:08:40,967 --> 00:08:42,067
IT'S EARLY.

321
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:42,767
>> YEAH.

322
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:43,833
I GOT TO WORK LATE TONIGHT,

323
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:44,933
BUT I'M GONNA BE THERE.

324
00:08:44,933 --> 00:08:46,333
>> YOU GOT TO BE UP AND HERE

325
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,400
OR WE'LL LEAVE YOU.

326
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,300
>> ARE THEY CHECKING YOUR CERVIX

327
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:49,167
OR SOMETHING THIS TIME?

328
00:08:49,167 --> 00:08:50,200
>> YES.

329
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,367
I HEARD THAT HURT WHEN THEY

330
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:52,067
CHECK YOUR CERVIX.

331
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:52,933
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT A CERVIX

332
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:53,533
IS.

333
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,500
I DON'T EVEN--I DON'T KNOW WHERE

334
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:55,100
IT IS.

335
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,967
I MEAN, I KNOW IT'S IN THERE,

336
00:08:55,967 --> 00:08:57,867
BUT...

337
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,467
>> HOW MANY OF THEM?

338
00:09:01,467 --> 00:09:02,233
>> I DON'T KNOW.

339
00:09:02,233 --> 00:09:04,200
SIX.

340
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,200
IS SHE KICKING YOU?

341
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,233
>> NO.

342
00:09:06,233 --> 00:09:07,067
>> WHY NOT?

343
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:08,333
>> 'CAUSE SHE DON'T WANT TO.

344
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:09,067
>> WAKE UP.

345
00:09:09,067 --> 00:09:11,067
>> SHE DON'T WANT TO WAKE UP.

346
00:09:14,967 --> 00:09:15,767
>> I JUST WISH YOU HAD, LIKE,

347
00:09:15,767 --> 00:09:16,500
A CODE WORD OR SOMETHING.

348
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,467
LIKE, IT JUST TAKES YOU...

349
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:20,833
>> WHY WOULD THEY FIRE YOU

350
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,233
'CAUSE YOU HAVING A BABY?

351
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:23,067
'CAUSE YOU LEAVING EARLY?

352
00:09:23,067 --> 00:09:23,833
>> YEAH.

353
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:24,967
>> I THINK THEY MAKE EXCEPTIONS

354
00:09:24,967 --> 00:09:26,967
FOR STUFF LIKE THAT.

355
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:39,133
>> YOU TIRED?

356
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,567
>> JAZMIN, FOR REAL, THIS IS THE

357
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:44,300
LAST 7:00 DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT.

358
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,200
>> THE NEXT ONE'S AT 8:30.

359
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,267
>> AND THEN ANY AFTER THAT IS

360
00:09:46,267 --> 00:09:48,333
GONNA HAVE TO BE AFTERNOON.

361
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,167
>> JAZMIN, YOU READY TO COME ON

362
00:09:49,167 --> 00:09:49,833
BACK?

363
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,700
>> YEP.

364
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:52,933
[knocks on door]

365
00:09:52,933 --> 00:09:54,067
>> HEY.

366
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:54,733
HOW ARE YOU, PUMPKIN?

367
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:55,633
>> FINE. HOW ARE YOU?

368
00:09:55,633 --> 00:09:56,667
>> I'M GOOD.

369
00:09:56,667 --> 00:09:57,800
ALL RIGHT, NOW, WHAT ARE YOU

370
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,667
FEELING?

371
00:09:58,667 --> 00:09:59,733
>> SHE'S INCREASINGLY MORE

372
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:00,833
UNCOMFORTABLE.

373
00:10:00,833 --> 00:10:01,567
>> THIRD TRIMESTER SUCKS,

374
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:02,233
DOESN'T IT?

375
00:10:02,233 --> 00:10:03,100
>> I CAN'T GET COMFORTABLE.

376
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,900
>> I KNOW IT.

377

00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:04,300
RULES WON'T BE SO STRICT ABOUT

498
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:05,633
HIM BEING OVER THE HOUSE AND,

499
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:07,067
LIKE, THEY'LL LET HIM STAY OVER

500
00:13:07,067 --> 00:13:08,800

512
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,067
FATHERHOOD AND CHANGE THE RULES.

513
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:25,067

THE TIME THAT HE WANTS, THE TIME

518
00:13:30,967 --> 00:13:32,067
THAT HE NEEDS TO GET LEARN HIS

519
00:13:32,067 --> 00:13:34,067

00:14:44,533 --> 00:14:46,533
HE'S REALLY WORKING HARD.

548
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,400

00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:07,900
WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN REALLY

567
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,200
REALIZE HOW LARGE THIS WILL BE

568
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,367
TO DO HOMEWORK, CATCH UP ON

569
00:15:12,367 --> 00:15:13,767
HOMEWORK, AND TAKE CARE OF A

570
00:15:13,767 --> 00:15:14,800
NEWBORN BABY.

571
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,167
>> I DON'T NEED A SET SCHEDULE.

572
00:15:16,167 --> 00:15:17,133
THAT'S WHAT MESSES ME UP IN

573
00:15:17,133 --> 00:15:18,067
LIFE.

574
00:15:18,067 --> 00:15:19,733
LIKE, MY OWN...

575
00:15:19,733 --> 00:15:21,633
DOO, DOO, DOO, DOO.

576
00:15:21,633 --> 00:15:22,567
>> I DON'T THINK SHE'S GONNA

577
00:15:22,567 --> 00:15:24,467
FOLLOW YOUR DOO, DOO, DOO, DOO.

578
00:15:24,467 --> 00:15:25,367
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

579
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:28,600
SO HER SCHEDULE IS GONNA

580
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,133
ADD THE BIG DOOPS.

581
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:32,067
>> IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'RE GONNA

582
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:33,567
TAKE YOUR CUES FROM HER.

583
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:34,233
>> YEAH.

584
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,133
>> WHEN SHE ASLEEP, YOU'RE GONNA

585
00:15:35,133 --> 00:15:35,800
STUDY.

586
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:36,833
>> YEAH, AND DO STUFF.

587
00:15:36,833 --> 00:15:38,133
>> HOWEVER, CONVENTIONAL WISDOM

588
00:15:38,133 --> 00:15:39,267
SAYS, "WHEN YOUR BABY SLEEP,

589
00:15:39,267 --> 00:15:39,933
YOU SLEEP."

590
00:15:39,933 --> 00:15:41,800
SO WHEN YOUR BABY ASLEEP,

591
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:42,733
YOU'LL BE STUDYING.

592
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:43,667
>> OR SHE'LL BE UP.

593
00:15:43,667 --> 00:15:44,867
I'M GONNA SIT THERE WITH HER

594
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:46,633
AND DO MY WORK.

595
00:15:46,633 --> 00:15:47,533
>> YOU'RE KIND

596
00:15:47,533 --> 00:15:48,200
OF MINIMIZING THIS.

597
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:49,167
I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA BE AS

598
00:15:49,167 --> 00:15:51,100
EASY AS YOU THINK.

599
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:52,067
>> OKAY, WELL, I GOT TO GET IT

600
00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:53,167
DONE, EASY OR NOT.

601
00:15:53,167 --> 00:15:54,067
>> RIGHT.

602
00:15:54,067 --> 00:15:54,700
THAT'S MY POINT.

603
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,733
SO I'M GLAD WE BOTH GOT THERE.

604
00:15:55,733 --> 00:15:56,700
>> GO ON.

605
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,700
[both giggle]

606
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:05,400
DELL IS OFF TODAY, SO HE TOOK

607
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:06,367
ME OUT TO LUNCH, AND NOW WE'RE

608
00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:08,200
DOING SOME SHOPPING FOR LAILA.

609
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,800
OH, BABY COSTUMES.

610
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,600
LOOK.

611
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,067
WHAT IS THIS, AN ELEPHANT?

612
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:12,733
>> IT'S A HIPPO.

613
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:14,100
>> WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?

614
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,533
THIS IS AN ELEPHANT.

615
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:16,700
>> OH, YEAH.

616
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:17,733
>> I THINK A HIPPO IS JUST A

617
00:16:17,733 --> 00:16:18,633
WATER ELEPHANT.

618
00:16:18,633 --> 00:16:20,633
[laughs]

619
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:23,933
>> ELEPHANTS DON'T LIVE IN

620
00:16:23,933 --> 00:16:24,567
WATER.

621
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:25,300
>> YEAH, THEY DO.

622
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,067
>> IT'S A MAMMAL.

623
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:26,967
IT LIVES ON LAND.

624
00:16:26,967 --> 00:16:28,133
SHE REALLY CAN'T WEAR TUTUS?

625
00:16:28,133 --> 00:16:28,800
THIS IS CUTE.

626
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,133
>> NOPE.

627
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:30,833
>> EVEN FOR, LIKE, BABY

628
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:31,467
PICTURES?

629
00:16:31,467 --> 00:16:32,133
>> NO.

630
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:33,067
>> WHAT ABOUT THIS ONE?

631
00:16:33,067 --> 00:16:34,067
DELL, THIS IS REALLY CUTE.

632
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:34,867
YOU CAN'T EVEN LIE.

633
00:16:34,867 --> 00:16:37,233
>> NO.

634
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:38,500
>> IT'S OKAY, LAILA.

635
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:40,200
I GOT YOU AND YOUR CLOTHES TOO.

636
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,133
>> "DADDY'S SWEETHEART."

637
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:41,933
SEE THAT?

638
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:43,500
>> OH, THAT'S CUTE.

639
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,533
>> IS THIS GONNA BE ALL FOR YOU

640
00:16:44,533 --> 00:16:45,200
TODAY?

641
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:46,133
>> YES, MA'AM.

642
00:16:46,133 --> 00:16:48,133
HERE YOU GO.

643
00:16:50,867 --> 00:16:51,667
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

644
00:16:51,667 --> 00:16:53,667
>> both: THANK YOU.

645
00:16:59,133 --> 00:17:00,567
>> HOW Y'ALL FEELING?

646
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:02,567
>> I'M READY.

647
00:17:04,733 --> 00:17:06,067
>> HAVE Y'ALL THOUGHT ABOUT ALL

648
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:06,767
THE LITTLE HOOPS AND STUFF

649
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:07,567
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO JUMP

650
00:17:07,567 --> 00:17:08,133
THROUGH?

651
00:17:08,133 --> 00:17:09,100
>> WHAT HOOPS?

652
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,367
>> HOW WE RUN THE HOUSEHOLD.

653
00:17:10,367 --> 00:17:11,533
JUST SO WE CLEAR...

654
00:17:11,533 --> 00:17:12,567
>> YES.

655
00:17:12,567 --> 00:17:14,233
>> NO VISITATION WHEN THERE'S NO

656
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,367
ADULTS HERE.

657
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:16,967
>> WELL, WHO COUNTS AS ADULT

658
00:17:16,967 --> 00:17:17,867
SUPERVISION?

659
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:20,067
>> TEESHA'S MOTHER, MY FATHER,

660
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:22,133
MYSELF, TEESHA.

661
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:23,833
IT'S A TRUST THING.

662
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:25,800
THAT'S ONE OF THE DOWNSIDES

663
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:29,067
TO NOT DOING IT

664
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:30,533
THE TRADITIONAL WAY,

665
00:17:30,533 --> 00:17:32,767
THAT WE GET A CALL FIRST BEFORE

666
00:17:32,767 --> 00:17:34,333
DELL COMES OVER.

667
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,100
>> YEAH.

668
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:38,500
>> NO SEX.

669
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,467
IT'S JUST THE RULES OF THE

670
00:17:39,467 --> 00:17:41,467
HOUSE.

671
00:17:44,767 --> 00:17:45,500
>> I UNDERSTAND THE RULES.

672
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,067
WE GET 'EM.

673
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,100
IT SUCKS MY PARENTS AREN'T

674
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,667
EASING UP ON THE HOUSE RULES,

675
00:17:50,667 --> 00:17:51,967
BUT SINCE I REALLY WANT TO EARN

676
00:17:51,967 --> 00:17:54,067
THEIR TRUST BACK, I CAN'T AFFORD

677
00:17:54,067 --> 00:17:56,067
TO BREAK THEM AGAIN.

678
00:17:57,567 --> 00:17:58,867
HOW'S IT GONNA WORK, LIKE, WITH

679
00:17:58,867 --> 00:18:00,167
OUR SCHEDULES AND STUFF,

680
00:18:00,167 --> 00:18:01,067
WHEN WE FIRST GET HOME FROM THE

681
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:02,067
HOSPITAL?

682
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:03,067
I MEAN, 'CAUSE OBVIOUSLY, YOU'RE

683
00:18:03,067 --> 00:18:03,800
STILL GONNA HAVE TO WORK AND

684
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,400
STUFF.

685
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,267
SO ARE YOU GONNA COME OVER EVERY

686
00:18:05,267 --> 00:18:06,567
DAY?

687
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:07,933
>> OF COURSE I'M GONNA COME OVER

688
00:18:07,933 --> 00:18:08,600
EVERY DAY.

689
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,400
>> LIKE, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT TO

690
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,067
DO?

691
00:18:10,067 --> 00:18:10,900
LIKE, DO YOU EXPECT TO JUST SIT

692
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,600
THERE AND PLAY WITH HER?

693
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:12,800
DO YOU--

694
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,067
>> I EXPECT TO DO EVERYTHING.

695
00:18:14,067 --> 00:18:14,833
>> SO IF SHE'S HUNGRY,

696
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:15,567
YOU'RE GONNA FEED HER.

697
00:18:15,567 --> 00:18:16,067
>> MM-HMM.

698
00:18:16,067 --> 00:18:16,733
>> IF SHE POOPS,

699
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:17,500
YOU'RE GONNA CHANGE HER.

700
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,433
>> YEAH.

701
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:26,300
>> HOUSE RULES:

702
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:29,100
NOBODY UNDERAGE HOME ALONE.

703
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,167
>> THAT'S PISSING ME OFF,

704
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:32,200
IRRITATING ME.

705
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,200
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

706
00:18:40,967 --> 00:18:41,633
>> RIGHT.

707
00:18:41,633 --> 00:18:42,933
I FEEL LIKE I'M KIND OF FED UP

708
00:18:42,933 --> 00:18:43,600
WITH IT.

709
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,867
I DON'T WANT YOU TO FEEL LIKE

710
00:18:44,867 --> 00:18:45,767
YOU'RE NOT SPENDING ENOUGH TIME

711
00:18:45,767 --> 00:18:46,433
WITH HER.

712
00:18:46,433 --> 00:18:47,367
I WANT YOU TO SEE HER AS MUCH AS

713
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:48,067
YOU WANT TO.

714
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:50,067
BUT RULES ARE RULES.

715
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,300
WE SHOULD RESPECT HER RULES,

716
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:55,633
HER HOUSEHOLD, JUST LIKE

717
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:56,300
I WOULD WANT, I GUESS,

718
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,300
LAILA TO RESPECT OURS.

719
00:19:05,633 --> 00:19:06,800
>> OKAY.

720
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,467
>> WHATEVER ME AND HER

721
00:19:07,467 --> 00:19:08,767
COMPROMISE ON, I'LL BE OKAY

722
00:19:08,767 --> 00:19:09,633
WITH.

723
00:19:09,633 --> 00:19:11,767
AS LONG AS I GET THE EXTRA TIME.

724
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:12,567
>> WHAT IF THERE'S NO

725
00:19:12,567 --> 00:19:14,567
COMPROMISE?

726
00:19:33,267 --> 00:19:34,333
>> ONCE THE BABY COMES, I DON'T

727
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:37,533
WANT TO DEAL WITH MY HAIR.

728
00:19:37,533 --> 00:19:39,133
MY DUE DATE IS IN A WEEK, AND

729
00:19:39,133 --> 00:19:40,267
DELL'S COMING BY TO TALK TO MY

730
00:19:40,267 --> 00:19:41,567
MOM ABOUT LOOSENING THE HOUSE

731
00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:43,567
RULES.

732
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:45,633
>> HI, DELL.

733
00:19:45,633 --> 00:19:46,800
>> HEY.

734
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:47,800
>> COME ON IN.

735
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,067
WHAT'S GOING ON?

736
00:19:54,800 --> 00:19:56,800
>> OKAY.

737
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,767
>> MM-HMM.

738
00:20:05,767 --> 00:20:07,433
>> I WANTED TO KNOW, LIKE, IF

739
00:20:07,433 --> 00:20:08,867
THAT COULD BE A POSSIBILITY OR

740
00:20:08,867 --> 00:20:10,600
CHANGE IN SOME KIND OF WAY.

741
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,400
>> I CAN APPRECIATE YOU WANTING

742
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,967
TO BE THERE FOR YOUR DAUGHTER'S

743
00:20:13,967 --> 00:20:17,033
FIRSTS AND SEEING THINGS,

744
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:19,167
YOU KNOW, THAT AS SHE DEVELOPS,

745
00:20:19,167 --> 00:20:21,067
THINGS LIKE THAT, BUT THE TRUTH

746
00:20:21,067 --> 00:20:22,700
OF THE MATTER IS, WE EXTENDED

747
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,267
TRUST TO YOU AND JAZMIN, AND

748
00:20:24,267 --> 00:20:26,300
THAT TRUST WAS ABUSED,

749
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:28,733
AND THAT'S NOT TAKEN LIGHTLY.

750
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:30,200
>> I FEEL LIKE I SHOULD BE ABLE

751
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,767
TO COME OVER AND BE TRUSTED

752
00:20:32,767 --> 00:20:34,833
AND TO KNOW THAT WE GONNA BE

753
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:35,500

THERE'S A LOT FOR ME TO LEARN,

SAME TIME SAYING YES TO HER MOM

1128
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:50,067
SO THERE ISN'T AN ARGUMENT.

GETTING HIM TIME TO SPEND WITH

1157
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,300
LAILA, IT'S BEEN HARD.

1158

MY MOM SAID SHE'S GONNA THINK

1163
00:33:37,067 --> 00:33:37,833
ABOUT IT, BUT THEN SHE THOUGHT

1164
00:33:37,833 --> 00:33:38,500
ABOUT IT AND SAID NO.

1165
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,300

1168
00:33:41,433 --> 00:33:42,100

00:38:43,067 --> 00:38:45,367
IT'S JUST, I WOULD'VE--

1308
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:47,700
I THINK WE SHOULD'VE WAITED.

1309
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,967
>> WE SHOULD'VE THOUGHT DEEPER

1310
00:38:48,967 --> 00:38:53,433
INTO OUR ACTIONS FOR HER,

1311
00:38:53,433 --> 00:38:55,200
NOT JUST FOR US.

1312
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,567
SO NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS

1313
00:38:56,567 --> 00:38:57,833
DOWN THE LINE, THE MOST

1314
00:38:57,833 --> 00:38:59,833
IMPORTANT THING TO ME IS LAILA.

1315
00:39:06,867 --> 00:39:07,800
ME AND DELL THOUGHT THAT WE

1316
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,633
COULD CO-PARENT TOGETHER AND WE

1317
00:39:09,633 --> 00:39:10,833
COULD FIGURE IT OUT ON OUR OWN

1318
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:13,133
AND BE HAPPY, BUT IT DIDN'T

1319
00:39:13,133 --> 00:39:14,333
HAPPEN THAT WAY.

1320
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:16,633
[Laila fussing]

1321
00:39:16,633 --> 00:39:17,767
THE HOUSE RULES ARE DIFFICULT

1322
00:39:17,767 --> 00:39:18,833
BECAUSE I WANTED TO GAIN MY

1323
00:39:18,833 --> 00:39:20,067
TRUST BACK, BUT ON THE OTHER

1324
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:21,400
HAND, I WANTED DELL TO HAVE TIME

1325
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,167
WITH HIS DAUGHTER AS MUCH AS

1326
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:22,833
POSSIBLE.

1327
00:39:22,833 --> 00:39:23,867
>> DOES DELL HAVE TO WORK TODAY?

1328
00:39:23,867 --> 00:39:24,667
>> NO.

1329
00:39:24,667 --> 00:39:25,633
>> DID HE SAY HE WAS COMING OVER

1330
00:39:25,633 --> 00:39:26,900
LATER OR HE WANTED TO COME OVER?

1331
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,833
>> HE WANTS TO, YEAH.

1332
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:28,667
IT WAS JUST HARD TRYING TO

1333
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:30,067
BALANCE THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT

1334
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:31,500
OF TIME THAT HE NEEDED WHILE

1335
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:33,533
ALSO RESPECTING THE HOUSE RULES

1336
00:39:33,533 --> 00:39:34,767
AND GETTING THE TRUST BACK FROM

1337
00:39:34,767 --> 00:39:35,533
MY MOM.

1338
00:39:35,533 --> 00:39:36,867
[Laila crying]

1339
00:39:36,867 --> 00:39:38,833
LAILA, SERIOUSLY?

1340
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:40,167
STOP SCRATCHING YOURSELF.

1341
00:39:40,167 --> 00:39:41,333
I'M DETERMINED TO GET DONE WITH

1342
00:39:41,333 --> 00:39:42,433
SCHOOL, BUT IT'S KIND OF HARD

1343
00:39:42,433 --> 00:39:44,767
BECAUSE I SET ASIDE TIME TO DO

1344
00:39:44,767 --> 00:39:46,867
MY SCHOOLWORK, BUT THEN IT GETS

1345
00:39:46,867 --> 00:39:48,533
SEEN AS BABY TIME.

1346
00:39:48,533 --> 00:39:50,067
I CAN'T DO IT WITH YOU SQUIRMING

1347
00:39:50,067 --> 00:39:52,233
AND CRYING 'CAUSE YOU'RE

1348
00:39:52,233 --> 00:39:53,933
DISTRACTING.

1349
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:55,467
BEFORE I HAD A BABY, I TREATED

1350
00:39:55,467 --> 00:39:57,300
SEX A LOT MORE LIGHTLY THAN I

1351
00:39:57,300 --> 00:40:00,100
SHOULD'VE.

1352
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:02,900
IT'S HARD WITH ONE HAND.

1353
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:03,867
SHE WANT TO BE HELD ALL THE

1354
00:40:03,867 --> 00:40:04,700
TIME.

1355
00:40:04,700 --> 00:40:05,833
AND I MADE A MESS.

1356
00:40:05,833 --> 00:40:07,300
I MADE A BIG OLD MESS.

1357
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,367
IF I COULD CHANGE ANYTHING, I

1358
00:40:08,367 --> 00:40:10,200
WOULD JUST HAVE LAILA LATER IN

1359
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,500
LIFE ONCE I GOT MY DEGREE AND

1360
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,900
FINISHED SCHOOL AND GOT SETTLED

1361
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:15,200
INTO A CAREER AND A HOUSE AND

1362
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,867
EVERYTHING AND JUST HAVE A

1363
00:40:16,867 --> 00:40:18,267
STABLE HOME FOR HER TO COME HOME

1364
00:40:18,267 --> 00:40:21,200
TO.

1365
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,400
I DON'T KNOW HOW THINGS WITH ME

1366
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:23,867
AND DELL ARE GONNA WORK OUT.

1367
00:40:23,867 --> 00:40:25,000
I'M HOPING FOR THE BEST BUT

1368
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:26,067
PREPARING FOR THE WORST.

1369
00:40:26,067 --> 00:40:27,300
AND SO I GUESS WE'LL JUST SEE

1370
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:27,967
WHAT HAPPENS.

1371
00:40:27,967 --> 00:40:29,967
[chime dings]

1372
00:40:47,233 --> 00:40:49,400
>> WE ARE BASICALLY HOMELESS.

1373
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,133
I HATE LIVING OUT OF THIS CAR.

1374
00:40:51,133 --> 00:40:52,233
>> IT'S TOUGH [bleep]!

1375
00:40:52,233 --> 00:40:54,900
THERE ISN'T NO WHERE TO GO!

1376
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,733
>> WOULD WE BE ABLE TO STAY

1377
00:40:55,733 --> 00:40:56,400
HERE?

1378
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,367
>> THERE'S NO ROOM.

1379
00:40:57,367 --> 00:40:59,033
[baby crying]

1380
00:40:59,033 --> 00:41:00,467
>> HER ONLY OPTION RIGHT NOW

1381
00:41:00,467 --> 00:41:01,767
IS A HOMELESS SHELTER.

1382
00:41:01,767 --> 00:41:02,567
>> YOUR BABY DOESN'T HAVE

1383
00:41:02,567 --> 00:41:04,467
ANYTHING.
