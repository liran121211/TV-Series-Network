A SMALL TOWN OUTSIDE OF HOUSTON.

00:00:09,977 --> 00:00:11,379
I LIVE WITH MY MOM;

00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:12,580
HER BOYFRIEND, GREG;

6
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:13,581
AND MY LITTLE BROTHER, JACOB.

>> MY PARENTS AREN'T TOGETHER,

BUT MY DAD AND I ARE REALLY

11
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:19,353
CLOSE.

12
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,122
CAN I GET GUMMY BEARS WITH IT?

13
00:00:21,122 --> 00:00:22,290
YES.

14
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:24,458
SADLY, OUR HOUSE ISN'T VERY BIG,

15
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:25,626
SO I HAVE TO SHARE A ROOM WITH

16
00:00:25,626 --> 00:00:27,295
MY BROTHER, WHICH REALLY SUCKS.

17
00:00:27,295 --> 00:00:28,662
TURN OFF THE LIGHT.

00:00:30,131 --> 00:00:31,265
AND IT'S GONNA GET A LOT MORE

21
00:00:31,265 --> 00:00:32,766
CROWDED SOON, BECAUSE MY MOM

22
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:34,235
IS HAVING A BABY.

23
00:00:34,235 --> 00:00:35,669

24
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:36,604
>> A LITTLE BIT BETTER.

00:00:36,604 --> 00:00:38,272
I'M TIRED OF BEING SICK.

WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR

28
00:00:41,008 --> 00:00:42,110
TWO YEARS, AND WE SPEND

29
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,010
ALL OF OUR TIME TOGETHER.

30
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:44,545
I DID MISS YOU TODAY.

>> I'VE ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD GIRL,

33
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:48,349
SO I STAY OUT OF TROUBLE

34
00:00:48,349 --> 00:00:49,217
AND STAY ON TOP OF MY

NO ONE KNEW I WAS PREGNANT

51
00:01:18,346 --> 00:01:19,813
BECAUSE I WASN'T SHOWING.

52
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:21,349

EVERYONE WILL KNOW,

55
00:01:24,017 --> 00:01:25,719
AND I'M KIND OF NERVOUS ABOUT

56
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,155
BEING THE PREGNANT GIRL.

ARE CLOSE BY, IT SUCKS THAT

122
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,606
ERIC WON'T BE THERE AT MY

123
00:02:52,606 --> 00:02:53,774
FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL.

124
00:02:53,774 --> 00:02:54,775

HAVE A BABY, WHICH IS WHY

131
00:03:04,518 --> 00:03:05,686
ERIC AND I HAVE BEEN TALKING

132
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,020
ABOUT MOVING IN TOGETHER.

133
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:08,121
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

134
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,156
>> THE PLAN IS FOR YOU TO COME

135
00:03:09,156 --> 00:03:10,991
AND MOVE IN, RIGHT?

136
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,025
>> WELL, YEAH.

137
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,961
BUT IS YOUR MOM OKAY WITH IT?

138
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:14,828
>> SHE'S OKAY WITH IT.

139
00:03:14,828 --> 00:03:15,763
>> WELL, WHEN ARE WE GONNA

140
00:03:15,763 --> 00:03:16,930
TELL MY MOM?

141
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,031
>> THINK SHE'LL BE MAD WHEN YOU

00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:19,633

I'M PRETTY SURE SHE'S GONNA

149
00:03:27,941 --> 00:03:30,611
A WHILE, SHE'LL BE OKAY.

150
00:03:30,611 --> 00:03:31,612
I MEAN, SHE'LL HAVE HER BABY

151
00:03:31,612 --> 00:03:33,314

00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:34,382
[chime dings]

153
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:35,883

154

AND IT WAS REALLY HARD FOR HER.

155
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:39,353
SO WHEN SHE FOUND OUT ERIC AND I

156
00:03:39,353 --> 00:03:41,755
WERE HAVING SEX, SHE FREAKED.

157
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:43,090
SHE MADE ME SWITCH SCHOOLS

158
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,592
AND GO LIVE WITH MY DAD,

159
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:46,594
AND THEY FORBID ME TO SEE ERIC.

160
00:03:46,594 --> 00:03:48,329
BUT WE WERE IN LOVE, SO ERIC

161
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:49,663
GOT HIS MOM TO HELP US HANG OUT

162
00:03:49,663 --> 00:03:51,332
BEHIND MY PARENTS' BACKS.

163
00:03:51,332 --> 00:03:53,166
THEN I FOUND OUT I WAS PREGNANT,

164
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,335
AND I HAD TO TELL MY PARENTS

165
00:03:54,335 --> 00:03:55,536
EVERYTHING.

166
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:57,605
THEY WERE NOT HAPPY.

167
00:03:57,605 --> 00:03:58,739
MY MOM CALMED DOWN AND LET ME

168
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,240
MOVE BACK HOME, AND NOW SHE'S

169
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,142
EVEN FRIENDLY WITH ERIC.

170
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:03,477
BUT SHE HASN'T FORGIVEN HIS MOM

171
00:04:03,477 --> 00:04:05,112
FOR HELPING US SNEAK AROUND.

172
00:04:05,112 --> 00:04:06,880
>> THE ONLY REASON THAT I WAS

173
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,516
REALLY, REALLY UPSET IS BECAUSE

174
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:10,484
AFTER I TOLD HER TO DO HER PART

175
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:12,320
AS A PARENT, SHE JUST SAID

176
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,054
THAT, I GUESS, Y'ALL WERE IN

177
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:16,290
LOVE AND Y'ALL WERE GONNA KEEP

178
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,625
SEEING EACH OTHER, AND THAT'S

179
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:18,959
NOT HOW 14-YEAR-OLDS SHOULD ACT.

180
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,127
YOU SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT

181
00:04:20,127 --> 00:04:23,431
YOUR SCHOOL AND NOT HAVING SEX.

00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:24,264
YOU KNOW?

183
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,033
AND I WAS JUST UPSET BECAUSE

184
00:04:26,033 --> 00:04:27,601
SHE WASN'T ON OUR SIDE.

185

378
00:09:48,656 --> 00:09:49,657
I SHOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE, "NO."

379
00:09:49,657 --> 00:09:50,758
>> SAID, "NO, IT'S A BEER GUT."

380

381
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,126
>> ARE YOU GONNA GO TO

382
00:09:53,126 --> 00:09:54,127
HOMECOMING THIS YEAR?

383
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:55,595
>> I WANT TO GO TO HOMECOMING.

384
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,097
WELL, ERIC WANTS TO GO TO PROM,

385
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,899
BUT IT'S EXPENSIVE.

386
00:09:58,899 --> 00:10:00,067
UNLESS YOU'RE PLANNING ON

387
00:10:00,067 --> 00:10:01,969
SAVING UP A LOT OF MONEY

388
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:03,336
SO WHERE WE'LL HAVE ENOUGH FOR

389
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,338
THE BABY FIRST.

390
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:06,239
>> ARE YOU GONNA BE BACK

391
00:10:06,239 --> 00:10:07,240
FOR GRADUATION?

392
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,241
LIKE, BE ABLE TO GO WITH THE

393
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:09,910
BABY AND ALL?

394
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,679
>> I HOPE I'LL BE CAUGHT UP AND

395
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,681
STUFF SO WHERE I'LL BE ABLE--

396
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:14,581
>> TO GRADUATE AND HAVE

397
00:10:14,581 --> 00:10:16,984
ALL YOUR CREDITS.

398
00:10:16,984 --> 00:10:18,652
>> YEAH.

399
00:10:18,652 --> 00:10:21,488
[chime dings]

400
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:22,723
>> MY MOM HAD ME WHEN

401
00:10:22,723 --> 00:10:24,391
SHE WAS 16, AND THEY BROKE UP

402
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:25,726
WHEN I WAS 2.

403
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:26,894
BUT NOW WE ALL GET ALONG,

404
00:10:26,894 --> 00:10:28,561
AND I SEE MY DAD A LOT.

405
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,063
AND HE CAN DEFINITELY RELATE

406
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:32,132
TO WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH.

407
00:10:32,132 --> 00:10:33,133
>> IT'S GONNA BE HARD FOR YOU

408
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,034
TO GET SLEEP, YOU KNOW,

409
00:10:34,034 --> 00:10:34,935
ENOUGH REST.

410
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:36,269
YOU KNOW, BUT I WANT YOU

411
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,470
TO FINISH SCHOOL.

412
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:38,305
>> THAT'S DEFINITELY

413
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:39,873
GONNA HAPPEN.

414
00:10:39,873 --> 00:10:40,974
>> I DIDN'T HAVE ANYONE TELLING

415
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:43,110
ME, "DON'T DROP OUT OF SCHOOL."

416
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,111
>> THERE'S THIS PROGRAM

417
00:10:44,111 --> 00:10:45,779
CALLED HOMEBOUND, AND THE

418
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:47,480
TEACHERS WILL COME, LIKE,

419
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,749
WHENEVER THE BABY KIND OF--

420
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:49,917
LIKE, THEY'LL BRING ME MY WORK,

421
00:10:49,917 --> 00:10:51,418
TO THE HOUSE.

422
00:10:51,418 --> 00:10:52,319
THAT WAY WHEN I GO BACK,

423
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:53,921
IT'S--LIKE, I'M CAUGHT UP.

424
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:55,422
AND I WAS THINKING I'D LIKE

425
00:10:55,422 --> 00:10:57,958
TO BECOME A TEACHER.

426
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:58,892
>> WHAT'S THE PLAN BETWEEN

427
00:10:58,892 --> 00:11:00,127
YOU AND ERIC?

428
00:11:00,127 --> 00:11:03,296
>> YEAH, ABOUT THAT.

429
00:11:03,296 --> 00:11:04,297
I MEAN, I KNOW THIS SOUNDS

430
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:06,967
LIKE A BAD IDEA RIGHT NOW,

431
00:11:06,967 --> 00:11:08,468
BUT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

432
00:11:08,468 --> 00:11:09,837
ME GOING OVER THERE.

433
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:11,504
THEY HAVE, LIKE, AN EXTRA ROOM

434
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,207
AT THEIR HOUSE FOR THE BABY.

435
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:15,542
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO?

436
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:17,544
>> I DON'T KNOW.

437
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:18,545
>> I DON'T REALLY WANT YOU

438
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:20,013
TO GO AND MOVE IN WITH HIM

439
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,114
BECAUSE WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IS,

440
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:21,982
THERE'S JUST GONNA BE

441
00:11:21,982 --> 00:11:22,649
REPETITION.

442
00:11:22,649 --> 00:11:23,683
YOU'RE GONNA GET PREGNANT AGAIN.

443
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,684
YOU KNOW, IT WAS HARD FOR US.

444
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,719
IT WAS HARD FOR ME TO GIVE UP

445
00:11:25,719 --> 00:11:27,220
MY FRIENDS AND GOING OUT AND

446
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,222
HAVING A GOOD TIME AND THEN JUST

447
00:11:29,222 --> 00:11:30,223
START WORKING.

448
00:11:30,223 --> 00:11:31,191
FROM THAT DAY FORTH, I MEAN,

449
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:32,425
IT WAS JUST WORK, WORK, WORK,

450
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:33,326
AND IT DIDN'T--IT HASN'T

451
00:11:33,326 --> 00:11:34,161
STOPPED YET.

452
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:36,263
YOU KNOW, I WANTED YOU TO

453
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:37,865
TAKE YOUR TIME, ENJOY LIFE.

454
00:11:37,865 --> 00:11:39,366
YOU'RE MY ONLY DAUGHTER.

455
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,734
YOU KNOW?

456
00:11:40,734 --> 00:11:42,369
BUT YOU NEED TO MAKE THIS

457
00:11:42,369 --> 00:11:43,871
DECISION ON YOUR OWN.

458
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:44,872
YOU KNOW, I CAN TELL YOU

459
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:45,906
I DON'T LIKE IT.

460
00:11:45,906 --> 00:11:46,907
>> YEAH.

461
00:11:46,907 --> 00:11:49,076
>> BUT IT'S UP TO YOU.

462
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:50,710
>> TALKING TO MY DAD GAVE ME

463
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:52,712
A LOT OF THINGS TO THINK ABOUT.

464
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:53,446
>> I LOVE YOU.

465
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,415
>> LOVE YOU TOO.

466
00:11:55,415 --> 00:11:56,750
I WAS FEELING PRETTY GOOD

467
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,051
UNTIL MY MOM CAME HOME FROM

468
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,420
WORK AND WANTED TO TALK.

469
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,688
HEY, MOM.

470
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:03,723
>> HEY, SAM.

471
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:04,892
>> WHAT'S UP?

472
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:05,926
>> I TALKED TO YOUR DAD,

473
00:12:05,926 --> 00:12:09,262
AND HE MENTIONED SOMETHING ABOUT

474
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,598
YOU MOVING IN WITH ERIC.

475
00:12:11,598 --> 00:12:13,767
>> WELL, ERIC AND I HAVE BEEN

476
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:15,535
TALKING ABOUT IT AND STUFF,

477
00:12:15,535 --> 00:12:16,469
'CAUSE WE THOUGHT IT WOULD

478
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:18,405
KIND OF BE EASIER IN A WAY,

479
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,539
INSTEAD OF HAVING TO MOVE HER

480
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:20,640
BACK AND FORTH.

481
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,009
>> [sighs]

482
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:22,943
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE READY

483
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:24,744
TO LIVE WITH SOMEBODY RIGHT NOW

484
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,079
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN IN THAT

485
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:27,447
SITUATION BEFORE.

486
00:12:27,447 --> 00:12:28,916
WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE

487
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:32,385
AND I GOT PREGNANT AND IT

488
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:34,221
WAS HARD, AND I JUST DON'T WANT

489
00:12:34,221 --> 00:12:35,789
YOU TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH THAT.

490
00:12:35,789 --> 00:12:37,891
>> THE MAIN REASON WHY

491
00:12:37,891 --> 00:12:39,392
WAS JUST BECAUSE, LIKE,

492
00:12:39,392 --> 00:12:40,427
I KNOW THERE WAS GONNA BE

493
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,195
MORE SPACE AND STUFF.

494
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:43,997
AND HIS MOM SAID SHE'D WATCH THE

495
00:12:43,997 --> 00:12:45,332
BABY DURING THE DAY AND STUFF.

496
00:12:45,332 --> 00:12:46,666
>> I MEAN, MINE AND HER

497
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,836
RELATIONSHIP ISN'T CLOSE

498
00:12:48,836 --> 00:12:50,603
TO BEING OKAY.

499
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:52,940
SO IT'S LIKE--I WOULDN'T

500
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:55,042
BE GOING OVER THERE.

501
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:56,376
>> I WANTED TO HAVE A SOLID PLAN

502
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,545
BEFORE THE BABY COMES, AND NOW

503
00:12:58,545 --> 00:12:59,880
EVERYTHING IS UP IN THE AIR.

504
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,048
AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT WE'RE

505
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:03,350
GOING TO DO.

506
00:13:10,223 --> 00:13:12,059
>> A MONTH HAS GONE BY,

507
00:13:12,059 --> 00:13:13,360
AND NEXT WEEK, I'M GOING WITH

508
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,694
ERIC TO THE SENIOR HOMECOMING

509
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:15,695
DANCE.

THIS ONE'S PRETTY.

514

>> I LIKE IT.

515
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:22,769
I THINK YOU SHOULD GET THIS ONE.

516
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:23,871
>> THIS DRESS LOOKS BIG,

517
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:24,938
LIKE, WIDE.

519
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:28,641
AND WE GOT REALLY NICE CORSAGES.

>> OH, YOUR DRESS.

00:13:30,978 --> 00:13:31,778
>> DO YOU LIKE IT?

00:13:31,778 --> 00:13:32,479
>> MM-HMM.

523
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:33,480
WHAT SIZE IS THAT?

524
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,315
>> SIZE 13.

I LOOK PRETTY.

530
00:13:46,126 --> 00:13:46,994
THANK YOU.

HOW DO YOU FEEL?

ERIC'S CASINO-THEMED HOMECOMING

546
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:18,525

[chime dings]

548
00:14:19,226 --> 00:14:20,227

FOR A FEW HOURS AND HAVE FUN

550
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,362

00:14:39,579 --> 00:14:41,281
MOVING IN IS A BAD IDEA.

566
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:42,782
SO WE'RE HAVING SECOND THOUGHTS,

567
00:14:42,782 --> 00:14:44,884
BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION.

568
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,186
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

569
00:14:46,186 --> 00:14:48,188
AM I JUST GONNA STAY HERE?

570
00:14:48,188 --> 00:14:48,956
>> [sighs]

571
00:14:48,956 --> 00:14:51,158
WELL...

572
00:14:51,158 --> 00:14:52,159
I'D LOVE FOR YOU TO COME

573
00:14:52,159 --> 00:14:52,926
MOVE IN.

574
00:14:52,926 --> 00:14:54,094
I'D LOVE TO WAKE UP EVERY

575
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:56,763
MORNING AND SEE MY BABY AND YOU.

576
00:14:56,763 --> 00:14:58,431
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

577
00:14:58,431 --> 00:14:59,499
US RUSHING INTO EVERYTHING

578
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,268
LIKE THAT, I REALLY, REALLY

579
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:02,535
DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU.

580
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:03,770
I REALLY LOVE YOU.

581
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:05,939
>> SO WHY ARE YOU SCARED THAT

582
00:15:05,939 --> 00:15:07,941
IF I MOVE IN, THINGS ARE GONNA

583
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:08,741
GO BAD?

584
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:11,244
>> LIKE, BEING YOUNG,

585
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,246
WE GOT A LOT OF TIME,

586
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:15,415
EXTRA TIME TOGETHER.

587
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:16,916
AND I JUST DON'T WANT TO BE,

588
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:19,019
LIKE, 30s OR 40s AND GETTING

589
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:20,720
TIRED OF EACH OTHER,

590
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:23,223
AND WE START HATING EACH OTHER.

591
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:24,391
SO I'M KIND OF STUCK IN

592
00:15:24,391 --> 00:15:25,192
THE MIDDLE.

593
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:27,427
THAT'S WHY WHATEVER YOU PICK,

594
00:15:27,427 --> 00:15:28,328
THEN I WON'T REALLY HAVE

595
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:29,496
A CHOICE, SO...

596
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:30,663
>> WITH MY MOM'S BABY HERE,

597
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:31,831
IT'S JUST GONNA BE REALLY,

598
00:15:31,831 --> 00:15:33,366
REALLY CROWDED, AND I MEAN,

599
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:34,701
MY MOM'S BABY IS GONNA BE

600
00:15:34,701 --> 00:15:36,103
SHARING A ROOM WITH JACOB,

601
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:37,971
SO IF ONE BABY'S CRYING,

602
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:39,239
I'M HOPING THE OTHER BABY

603
00:15:39,239 --> 00:15:42,509
WON'T WAKE UP.

604
00:15:42,509 --> 00:15:43,710
BUT I GUESS I'LL JUST STAY HERE

605
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,513
FOR A LITTLE BIT.

606
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:47,514
>> SO TALK TO YOUR MOM,

607
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:48,381
JUST LET HER KNOW THAT

608
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:49,316
YOU'RE STAYING.

609
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:50,650
>> OKAY.

610
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,484
[chime dings]

611
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:52,485
I HAVE TO ADMIT.

612
00:15:52,485 --> 00:15:53,653
I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED THAT

613
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:54,988
ERIC AND I AREN'T MOVING IN

614
00:15:54,988 --> 00:15:56,323
TOGETHER, AND I HOPE THINGS

615
00:15:56,323 --> 00:15:58,491
WILL BE OKAY.

616
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,731
MY DUE DATE IS TWO WEEKS AWAY,

617
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:05,732
RIGHT BEFORE CHRISTMAS,

618
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:07,567
AND I'M WORRIED BECAUSE DESPITE

619
00:16:07,567 --> 00:16:09,236
MY EFFORTS, OUR MOMS ARE STILL

620
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:11,204
NOT TALKING.

621
00:16:11,204 --> 00:16:12,872
SHE HAS A LOT OF BLANKETS.

622
00:16:12,872 --> 00:16:14,041
I HAD TO HAVE TWO DIFFERENT

623
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:17,277
BABY SHOWERS.

624
00:16:17,277 --> 00:16:18,478
I DON'T WANT JORDYNN GROWING UP

625
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:19,479
WITH GRANDPARENTS WHO CAN'T

626
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:20,280
GET ALONG.

627
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:21,414
I JUST WANT US TO TRY AND

628
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:22,615
GET ALONG, LIKE, AT LEAST FOR

629
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:23,616
THE BABY.

630
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:25,085
SO I GOT ERIC'S MOM TO AGREE

631
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:26,819
TO COME TO DINNER WITH MY MOM.

632
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:27,720
>> FOR THE BABY'S SAKE,

633
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,421
I WILL DO IT.

634
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:29,156
I WILL DO IT.

635
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:29,922
I WILL BE THERE.

636
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:30,990
>> AND I CONVINCED MY MOM

637
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,159
TO SHOW UP.

638
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:33,160
>> WHAT?

639
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,929
>> NOTHING.

640
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:37,730
>> HOW YOU DOING?

641
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:38,631
>> HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

642
00:16:38,631 --> 00:16:39,366
>> HOW ARE YOU?

643
00:16:39,366 --> 00:16:39,966
>> HEY.

644
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:40,867
>> HOW'S IT GOING, MAN?

645
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:41,668
>> HI.

646
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:42,969
>> HI.

647
00:16:42,969 --> 00:16:43,870
>> DON'T LEAVE YOUR COAT

648
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:44,637
ON THE FLOOR.

649
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:45,505
>> WHAT ARE YOU GETTING

650
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:46,473
TO DRINK?

651
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:49,442
>> I'M GONNA GET A SUPREME.

652
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:50,443
[tense music]

653
00:16:50,443 --> 00:16:58,418
* *

654
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,423
>> SO HOW'S THE WEATHER?

655
00:17:03,423 --> 00:17:04,124
>> SAMANTHA.

656
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:04,957
[laughter]

657
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:05,758
>> GETTING BETTER.

658
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:08,395
>> SAMANTHA.

659
00:17:10,997 --> 00:17:12,399
>> THANK YOU.

660
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:16,769
WELL, I'M GLAD Y'ALL COULD COME.

661
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:19,106
WE JUST WANT TO, LIKE,

662
00:17:19,106 --> 00:17:22,975
PUT EVERYTHING IN THE PAST.

663
00:17:27,447 --> 00:17:28,548
I WAS SCARED NO ONE WOULD BREAK

664
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,716
THE AWKWARD SILENCE, BUT

665
00:17:29,716 --> 00:17:31,951
FINALLY, MY MOM SPOKE UP.

666
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:33,786
>> I JUST FELT LIKE YOU GOING

667
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:35,122
BEHIND OUR BACK PICKING HER UP,

668
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:37,090
TAKING THE CELL PHONE JUST SO

669
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:37,890
THAT THEY CAN HAVE

670
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,092
CONTACT TO SEE EACH OTHER,

671
00:17:39,092 --> 00:17:40,260
I JUST DON'T THINK THAT THAT WAS

672
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,495
A RESPONSIBLE MOVE AS A PARENT.

673
00:17:42,495 --> 00:17:43,463
>> I FELT Y'ALL WERE JUDGING

674
00:17:43,463 --> 00:17:44,697
ERIC BEFORE GETTING

675
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:45,832
TO KNOW ERIC.

676
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:46,666
>> BUT YOU KNOW WHAT,

677
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:47,634
IT'S NOT THAT WE DIDN'T GIVE

678
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,302
ERIC A CHANCE, BECAUSE IT WASN'T

679
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:50,703
UNTIL THE FACT THAT WE FOUND OUT

680
00:17:50,703 --> 00:17:52,105
THAT THEY WERE HAVING SEX.

681
00:17:52,105 --> 00:17:54,141
THAT'S WHEN I STARTED BEING MAD,

682
00:17:54,141 --> 00:17:54,974
NOT ONLY AT HIM;

683
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:56,143
I WAS MAD AT HER.

684
00:17:56,143 --> 00:17:58,945
IT'S BOTH OF THEM.

685
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:00,413
>> SO?

686
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:01,448
>> I'M...

687
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:03,150
>> START FRESH?

688
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,083
>> I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT

689
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,752
I DO APOLOGIZE FOR TAKING HIM

690
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:06,586
TO SEE HER.

691
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,421
YOU KNOW, I KNEW IT WAS WRONG--

692
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,222
NOW I DO.

693
00:18:09,222 --> 00:18:11,391
AT THE TIME, I DIDN'T.

694
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:12,725
AT THE MOMENT, I'M THINKING,

695
00:18:12,725 --> 00:18:13,726
"I'M SEEING MY SON CRY.

696
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:14,894
I'M SEEING MY SON HURT."

697
00:18:14,894 --> 00:18:15,862
YOU KNOW, SO AT THAT MOMENT,

698
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:16,729
I'M THINKING, YOU KNOW,

699
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:17,664
"I GOT TO DO WHAT'S RIGHT

700
00:18:17,664 --> 00:18:18,365
FOR MY SON."

701
00:18:18,365 --> 00:18:20,333
NOW I UNDERSTAND, AS A MOTHER,

702
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,802
HOW OFFENDED YOU MUST HAVE FELT,

703
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:24,604
AT THE TIME, FOR WHAT I DID.

704
00:18:24,604 --> 00:18:25,605
YOU KNOW, AND THEN I DO

705
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:26,773
APOLOGIZE FOR THAT.

706
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,142
YOU KNOW, I DO.

707
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:30,076
>> YOU KNOW, WHAT HAPPENED

708
00:18:30,076 --> 00:18:31,010
BEFORE, IT'S IN THE PAST.

709
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:32,679
AND IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU.

710
00:18:32,679 --> 00:18:34,281
IT'S NOT ABOUT ME.

711
00:18:34,281 --> 00:18:36,516
IT'S ABOUT THE BABY.

712
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:37,317
SHE MADE HER BED.

713
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:38,318
SHE'S GONNA HAVE TO LIE IN IT.

714
00:18:38,318 --> 00:18:39,452
THAT'S HOW THEY'RE GONNA LEARN.

715
00:18:39,452 --> 00:18:41,120
I TELL YOU THAT ALL THE TIME.

716
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,821
RIGHT?

717
00:18:41,821 --> 00:18:42,755
>> AND I ALWAYS TELL YOU,

718
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:43,856
"MOM, I DON'T MAKE MY BED."

719
00:18:43,856 --> 00:18:44,857
[laughter]

720
00:18:44,857 --> 00:18:45,592
>> SAMANTHA.

721
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:47,427
>> I DO.

722
00:18:47,427 --> 00:18:50,430
I HOPE THINGS STAY GOOD,

723
00:18:50,430 --> 00:18:51,764
'CAUSE RIGHT NOW,

724
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:54,434
IT SEEMS GOOD.

725
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:55,268
>> ME TOO.

726
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:56,269
[laughter]

727
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:57,604
>> TONIGHT WAS REALLY GREAT.

728
00:18:57,604 --> 00:18:59,272
OUR MOMS MAY NOT BE BEST FRIENDS

729
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:00,773
ANY TIME SOON, BUT IT'S A GOOD

730
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:03,042
STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

731
00:19:10,049 --> 00:19:11,384
>> NOW THAT THE BABY'S ALMOST

732
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:13,052
HERE, I'M REALLY HAPPY TO HAVE

733
00:19:13,052 --> 00:19:14,954
OUR PARENTS' FEUD BEHIND US.

734
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:16,856
I GUESS LAST NIGHT WENT OKAY.

735
00:19:16,856 --> 00:19:18,124
>> YEAH, IT WENT GREAT.

736
00:19:18,124 --> 00:19:19,926
>> HOPEFULLY, THEY TALK

737
00:19:19,926 --> 00:19:21,394
NEXT TIME THEY SEE EACH OTHER.

738
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:22,295
>> WHICH WILL BE...

739
00:19:22,295 --> 00:19:23,463
>> PROBABLY NOT TILL

740
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:24,931
THE HOSPITAL.

741
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:25,632
[chime dings]

742
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:26,666
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE'RE ABOUT TO

743
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:30,203
HAVE A BABY IN LESS THAN A WEEK.

744
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:31,571
AFTER I HAVE THE BABY,

745
00:19:31,571 --> 00:19:32,572
I'LL BE DOING HOMESCHOOL

746
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:34,006
FOR SIX WEEKS BEFORE I GO

747
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,242
BACK TO HIGH SCHOOL,

748
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:36,543
SO I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET AHEAD

749
00:19:36,543 --> 00:19:37,744
IN MY SCHOOLWORK SO I DON'T

750
00:19:37,744 --> 00:19:39,078
FALL BEHIND.

751
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:40,413

00:35:57,623 --> 00:35:58,324
YOU SEEM MAD.

1311
00:35:58,324 --> 00:35:58,957
>> TIRED.

1312
00:35:58,957 --> 00:36:00,192
AND MY MOM FINALLY HAD

1313
00:36:00,192 --> 00:36:02,428
HER BABY BOY, GREG JR.

1314
00:36:02,428 --> 00:36:03,229
>> HEY, Y'ALL.

1315
00:36:03,229 --> 00:36:04,830
>> HOW'S THE BABY?

1316
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:05,664
>> GOOD.

1317
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:06,998
>> CUTE.

1318
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,267
>> GOD, SHE'S SO MUCH BIGGER

1319
00:36:08,267 --> 00:36:09,735
THAN HIM.

1320
00:36:09,735 --> 00:36:10,736
>> EVERYTHING'S BEEN A LITTLE

1321
00:36:10,736 --> 00:36:12,003
CRAZIER WITH TWO BABIES IN

1322
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:12,938
THE HOUSE.

1323
00:36:12,938 --> 00:36:16,174
[baby crying]

1324
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,843
>> HE PEED ON ME.

1325
00:36:17,843 --> 00:36:19,378
>> HE PEED IN YOUR FACE.

1326
00:36:19,378 --> 00:36:20,846
>> ALMOST.

1327
00:36:20,846 --> 00:36:21,880
>> EW.

1328
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,249
AND I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING TO KEEP

1329
00:36:23,249 --> 00:36:26,184
UP WITH MY WORK.

1330
00:36:31,223 --> 00:36:32,791
I HAVE TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

1331
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:33,592
OKAY, HERE.

1332
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:34,593
>> HAVE A GOOD DAY AT SCHOOL,

1333
00:36:34,593 --> 00:36:35,193
MOMMY.

1334
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,127
>> SO LUCKILY, ERIC'S MOM

1335
00:36:36,127 --> 00:36:37,095
HAS AGREED TO WATCH THE BABY

1336
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:39,431
DURING THE DAY.

1337
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:45,337
[chime dings]

1338
00:36:45,337 --> 00:36:49,074
[school bell rings]

1339
00:36:49,074 --> 00:36:49,775
HEY.

1340
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:53,412
>> HEY.

1341
00:36:53,412 --> 00:36:54,513
>> I'M SO SLEEPY.

1342
00:36:54,513 --> 00:36:56,214
LIKE, IN ECONOMICS, WE DIDN'T DO

1343
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:57,949
ANYTHING TODAY, AND I FELL

1344
00:36:57,949 --> 00:36:59,885
ASLEEP IN CLASS.

1345
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:00,919
THINGS ARE GETTING REALLY

1346
00:37:00,919 --> 00:37:02,187
CHAOTIC, SHUFFLING BETWEEN

1347
00:37:02,187 --> 00:37:03,722
SCHOOL, ERIC'S HOUSE,

1348
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,023
AND MY HOUSE.

1349
00:37:05,023 --> 00:37:06,024
I FEEL LIKE I'M GETTING SHOT

1350
00:37:06,024 --> 00:37:09,528
IN ALL DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.

1351
00:37:09,528 --> 00:37:11,196
THE ONLY TIME I CAN CATCH MY

1352
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:12,664
BREATH IS ON THE WEEKEND.

1353
00:37:12,664 --> 00:37:14,333
I KNOW ERIC REALLY CARES ABOUT

1354
00:37:14,333 --> 00:37:16,001
JORDYNN, BUT IT FEELS LIKE I'M

1355
00:37:16,001 --> 00:37:17,669
THE ONLY ONE WORRYING ABOUT HER,

1356
00:37:17,669 --> 00:37:23,409
AND I NEED MORE SUPPORT.

1357
00:37:23,409 --> 00:37:24,410
[sighs]

1358
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:25,577
>> WHAT?

1359
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:27,646
>> YOU MAKE ME ANGRY.

1360
00:37:27,646 --> 00:37:28,514
>> HOW?

1361
00:37:28,514 --> 00:37:29,881
>> IT'S LIKE YOU WANT TO PLAY

1362
00:37:29,881 --> 00:37:32,418
ALL THE TIME, AND IT

1363
00:37:32,418 --> 00:37:34,252
CAN'T ALWAYS BE ABOUT FUN.

1364
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:35,020
>> WHY?

1365
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:37,122
>> BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT

1366
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:38,457
TO WORRY ABOUT, AND YOU DON'T

1367
00:37:38,457 --> 00:37:39,658
LIKE TO THINK ABOUT THAT STUFF.

1368
00:37:39,658 --> 00:37:40,692
>> LIKE WHAT?

1369
00:37:40,692 --> 00:37:42,428
>> THE FUTURE AND MONEY.

1370
00:37:42,428 --> 00:37:43,228
>> REALLY?

1371
00:37:43,228 --> 00:37:44,162
>> AND YOU'RE JUST NOT AS

1372
00:37:44,162 --> 00:37:45,263
SERIOUS ABOUT IT.

1373
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:48,099
SOMETIMES I JUST DON'T KNOW

1374
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:50,569
ABOUT US.

1375
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:51,470
>> I MEAN, I KNOW I GOT

1376
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:52,237
TO GO TO WORK.

1377
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:53,204
I KNOW I GOT TO MAKE MONEY,

1378
00:37:53,204 --> 00:37:56,174
BECAUSE WE DO, IN TIME, NEED

1379
00:37:56,174 --> 00:37:57,476
OUR OWN HOUSE AND EVERYTHING,

1380
00:37:57,476 --> 00:37:58,810
BUT THAT'S LATER.

1381
00:37:58,810 --> 00:37:59,778
YOU'RE EXPECTING SO MUCH OUT

1382
00:37:59,778 --> 00:38:03,649
OF ME THAT ISN'T NEEDED YET.

1383
00:38:03,649 --> 00:38:06,652
>> WELL, MAYBE I DO NEED TO

1384
00:38:06,652 --> 00:38:08,320
LOOSEN UP A LITTLE BIT,

1385
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,323
BUT YOU ALSO NEED TO BE A LITTLE

1386
00:38:11,323 --> 00:38:12,958
MORE SERIOUS.

1387
00:38:12,958 --> 00:38:15,761
>> WELL, WE'LL WORK ON IT.

1388
00:38:15,761 --> 00:38:17,429
OKAY?

1389
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:18,564
>> OKAY.

1390
00:38:18,564 --> 00:38:19,565
>> 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO MAKE

1391
00:38:19,565 --> 00:38:21,066
YOU FEEL LIKE THAT.

1392
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:22,501
>> I HAD NO IDEA BEING A PARENT

1393
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:24,736
WOULD BE SO HARD, BUT AT LEAST

1394
00:38:24,736 --> 00:38:25,737
ERIC IS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

1395
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:28,674
WHY I'M SO FRUSTRATED.

1396
00:38:34,413 --> 00:38:35,313
>> HEY.

1397
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:36,314
>> HEY.

1398
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,716
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1399
00:38:37,716 --> 00:38:40,285
>> JORDYNN'S SCRAPBOOK.

1400
00:38:40,285 --> 00:38:41,252
>> SO HOW'S EVERYTHING WITH

1401
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:42,588
ERIC NOW?

1402
00:38:42,588 --> 00:38:46,392
>> IT'S, IN A WAY, BETTER,

1403
00:38:46,392 --> 00:38:49,227
BUT I MEAN, I GUESS WE HAVE

1404
00:38:49,227 --> 00:38:50,496
OUR DAYS.

1405
00:38:50,496 --> 00:38:52,698
>> YEAH, EVERYBODY DOES.

1406
00:38:52,698 --> 00:38:53,565
AS LONG AS HE'S THERE

1407
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:56,034
AND HE'S WANTING TO HELP YOU

1408
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:58,904
AND TRY TO BECOME A FAMILY,

1409
00:38:58,904 --> 00:39:00,539
THAT'S A START.

1410
00:39:00,539 --> 00:39:01,873
DON'T GET MAD AT HIM,

1411
00:39:01,873 --> 00:39:03,308
BUT JUST REMIND HIM.

1412
00:39:03,308 --> 00:39:05,343
>> IT'S NOT, LIKE, EASY.

1413
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,244
>> RIGHT.

1414
00:39:06,244 --> 00:39:08,747
>> LOOKING BACK, YOU AND DAD

1415
00:39:08,747 --> 00:39:09,915
TELLING ME NOT TO HAVE SEX

1416
00:39:09,915 --> 00:39:10,882
AND STUFF.

1417
00:39:10,882 --> 00:39:11,783
I MEAN, Y'ALL WERE RIGHT

1418
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:12,451
ABOUT THAT.

1419
00:39:12,451 --> 00:39:15,253
I WASN'T READY.

1420
00:39:15,253 --> 00:39:16,988
AND IT'S, LIKE--

1421
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:19,090
I DON'T REGRET ANYTHING

1422
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:22,293
BECAUSE I LOVE JORDYNN SO MUCH,

1423
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:24,963
BUT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE

1424
00:39:24,963 --> 00:39:26,732
TO WAIT A WHILE.

1425
00:39:26,732 --> 00:39:27,833
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A LOT BETTER

1426
00:39:27,833 --> 00:39:28,534
FOR HER TOO.

1427
00:39:28,534 --> 00:39:31,503
YEAH.

1428
00:39:35,741 --> 00:39:37,142
MY MOM WAS A TEEN MOM,

1429
00:39:37,142 --> 00:39:38,477
AND SHE TOLD ME HOW HARD

1430
00:39:38,477 --> 00:39:40,646
IT WAS GONNA BE, AND I WISH

1431
00:39:40,646 --> 00:39:41,813
I WOULD HAVE LISTENED,

1432
00:39:41,813 --> 00:39:43,348
BECAUSE IT'S, LIKE, NOW

1433
00:39:43,348 --> 00:39:45,383
I HAVE TO GO THROUGH IT MYSELF,

1434
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,786
AND THIS IS NOT HOW MY LIFE

1435
00:39:47,786 --> 00:39:51,457
WAS SUPPOSED TO BE.

1436
00:39:51,457 --> 00:39:52,958
COLLEGE AND EVERYTHING IS GONNA

1437
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:55,160
BE SO MUCH HARDER, BUT I HAVE

1438
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:55,994
TO DO IT.

1439
00:39:55,994 --> 00:40:02,333
I HAVE TO FOR JORDYNN.

1440
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:04,436
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH ERIC NOW

1441
00:40:04,436 --> 00:40:05,804
IS CRAZY, 'CAUSE IT'S LIKE

1442
00:40:05,804 --> 00:40:07,806
I REALLY DON'T KNOW IF

1443
00:40:07,806 --> 00:40:08,640
WE'RE GONNA LAST.

1444
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,476
I MEAN, I WANT US TO,

1445
00:40:10,476 --> 00:40:11,643
AND I'M HOPING WE WILL,

1446
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:13,979
BUT SOMETIMES I'M JUST NOT

1447
00:40:13,979 --> 00:40:15,981
REALLY SURE, AND IT'S SCARY

1448
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:17,315
BECAUSE I WANT HER TO HAVE

1449
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:19,150
BOTH OF US IN HER LIFE, LIKE,

1450
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:20,652
ALL THE TIME, 'CAUSE THAT'S

1451
00:40:20,652 --> 00:40:21,753
HOW IT SHOULD BE.

1452
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:23,622
>> * ALL YOUR PETALS *

1453
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:25,557
* FLOAT AWAY *

1454
00:40:25,557 --> 00:40:26,625
>> SHE'S LIKE, "YOU BETTER NOT

1455
00:40:26,625 --> 00:40:27,659
PISS OFF MY MOMMY.

1456
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:29,027
I'LL BEAT YOU UP."

1457
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:29,728
>> NO.

1458
00:40:29,728 --> 00:40:31,062
>> EVERYBODY THOUGHT I WAS,

1459
00:40:31,062 --> 00:40:32,430
LIKE, LITTLE MISS PERFECT,

1460
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:33,732
AND THEN WHEN I GOT PREGNANT,

1461
00:40:33,732 --> 00:40:34,766
EVERYBODY'S LIKE,

1462
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,167
"YOU'RE PREGNANT?

1463
00:40:36,167 --> 00:40:37,268
YOU DON'T EVEN DO STUFF

1464
00:40:37,268 --> 00:40:38,470
LIKE THAT.

1465
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:39,337
YOU'RE A GOOD GIRL."

1466
00:40:39,337 --> 00:40:41,072
AND IT'S JUST, LIKE--

1467
00:40:41,072 --> 00:40:42,508
I AM A GOOD GIRL.

1468
00:40:42,508 --> 00:40:45,176
I JUST MADE A DECISION

1469
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:46,411
TO HAVE SEX, AND IT HAD

1470
00:40:46,411 --> 00:40:47,813
CONSEQUENCES.

1471
00:40:47,813 --> 00:40:50,415
AND NOW I'M LIVING WITH THEM.
