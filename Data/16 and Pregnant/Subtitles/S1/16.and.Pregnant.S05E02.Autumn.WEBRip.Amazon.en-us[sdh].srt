1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,000
>> I'M AUTUMN.

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,200
I'M A 16-YEAR-OLD SOPHOMORE FROM

3
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,000
RICHMOND, VIRGINIA, AND I LOVE

4
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,267
PARTYING WITH MY FRIENDS.

5
00:00:11,267 --> 00:00:12,567
>> all: OH!

6
00:00:12,567 --> 00:00:14,267
[all laugh]

7
00:00:14,267 --> 00:00:15,500
>> I MET MY BOYFRIEND, DUSTIN,

8
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:17,333
OVER A YEAR AGO, AND IT WAS LOVE

9
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,100
AT FIRST SIGHT.

10
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:19,200
>> I'M TIRED.

11
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:20,400
>> YOU HAVE PJs ON?

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:21,100
>> YEAH.

13
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,400
>> WE SPEND ALL OUR TIME

14
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,067
TOGETHER.

15
00:00:23,067 --> 00:00:23,767
LOVE YOU.

16
00:00:23,767 --> 00:00:24,533
>> LOVE YOU TOO.

17
00:00:24,533 --> 00:00:25,900
>> MY MOM WARNED ME TO TAKE

18
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,933
THINGS SLOW WITH HIM, ESPECIALLY

19
00:00:27,933 --> 00:00:29,567
BECAUSE MY OLDER SISTER MISTY

20
00:00:29,567 --> 00:00:31,567
JUST HAD A BABY.

21
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:35,800
BUT I DIDN'T LISTEN, AND NOW I'M

22
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,467
PREGNANT.

23
00:00:36,467 --> 00:00:38,467
[chime dings]

24
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,267
AFTER I FOUND OUT I WAS

25
00:00:44,267 --> 00:00:44,933
PREGNANT,

26
00:00:44,933 --> 00:00:46,433
I STOPPED PARTYING AND GOT

27
00:00:46,433 --> 00:00:48,233
SERIOUS ABOUT MY FUTURE.

28
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:49,733
I STARTED HOME SCHOOL SO I CAN

29
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:51,500
KEEP UP MY GRADES WHILE I TAKE

30
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:52,500
CARE OF MY BABY.

31
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:54,167
DUSTIN, ON THE OTHER HAND, STILL

32
00:00:54,167 --> 00:00:55,433
LIVES A CAREFREE LIFE.

33
00:00:55,433 --> 00:00:57,633
[all laugh]

34
00:00:57,633 --> 00:00:59,233
>> WE'RE ALREADY STUCK.

35
00:00:59,233 --> 00:01:00,833
>> HE DOESN'T HAVE A JOB AND IS

36
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:02,067
ALWAYS HANGING OUT WITH HIS

37
00:01:02,067 --> 00:01:03,067
FRIENDS.

38
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:04,600
I'M WORRIED HE HAS NO PLANS TO

39
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:06,600
GIVE UP PARTYING FOR PARENTHOOD.

40
00:01:07,633 --> 00:01:08,533
>> NOT EVEN CLOSE.

41
00:01:08,533 --> 00:01:09,633
>> YOU'RE LYING.

42
00:01:09,633 --> 00:01:11,067
>> NO, I'M NOT.

43
00:01:11,067 --> 00:01:12,567
>> EVERYONE DOUBTS DUSTIN WILL

44
00:01:12,567 --> 00:01:13,700
MAN UP FOR OUR SON,

45
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:15,333
EVEN HIS OWN MOM.

46
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:16,833
>> I DON'T FEEL AS THOUGH YOU

47
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:18,700
ARE MENTALLY READY TO BE A DAD.

48
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:19,767
>> I KNOW I'M NOT.

49
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:21,200
I JUST WANT TO PARTY WHILE I

50
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,167
CAN.

51
00:01:23,167 --> 00:01:24,367
>> I KNOW DUSTIN HAS A LOT OF

52
00:01:24,367 --> 00:01:25,967
GROWING UP TO DO, BUT I LOVE

53
00:01:25,967 --> 00:01:27,467
HIM, AND I BELIEVE HE WILL BE A

54
00:01:27,467 --> 00:01:28,733
GOOD FATHER.

55
00:01:28,733 --> 00:01:30,700
I'M WRITING, "I LOVE YOU."

56
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,600
>> FIGURES.

57
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,367
HEY, DON'T DO THAT.

58
00:01:34,367 --> 00:01:35,433
>> WHY NOT?

59
00:01:35,433 --> 00:01:36,567
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S ONLY A

60
00:01:36,567 --> 00:01:37,667
YEAR SINCE WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER.

61
00:01:37,667 --> 00:01:38,500
>> I'M YOUR LONGEST

62
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,067
RELATIONSHIP.

63
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,267
>> I'M YOUR LONGEST.

64
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,133
>> I KNOW.

65
00:01:42,133 --> 00:01:42,967
>> MM-HMM.

66
00:01:42,967 --> 00:01:43,767
>> [laughs]

67
00:01:43,767 --> 00:01:45,067
REMEMBER WHEN I TOLD YOU I WAS

68
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:46,500
PREGNANT?

69
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:47,400
>> NO.

70
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,600
>> I PUT THE PREGNANCY TEST UP

71
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,867
TO FACETIME.

72
00:01:49,867 --> 00:01:50,633
>> OH, YEAH.

73
00:01:50,633 --> 00:01:52,067
I HONESTLY DON'T BELIEVE THE

74
00:01:52,067 --> 00:01:53,867
LITTLE PREGNANCY TEST THINGS.

75
00:01:53,867 --> 00:01:54,967
>> HOW THE HELL DO YOU NOT

76
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:56,433
BELIEVE PREGNANCY TESTS?

77
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:57,100
>> I DON'T KNOW.

78
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,333
I ALWAYS THOUGHT THEY WERE--

79
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:00,100
THEY WERE BULL[bleep].

80
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:00,833
WHAT?

81
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:02,433
>> I HOPE YOU BELIEVE IT.

82
00:02:02,433 --> 00:02:04,300
>> I BELIEVE IT NOW.

83
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,433
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO ABOUT

84
00:02:05,433 --> 00:02:06,100
SCHOOL?

85
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,067
>> I'M GONNA STAY ON HOMEBOUND,

86
00:02:07,067 --> 00:02:07,633
HOPEFULLY.

87
00:02:07,633 --> 00:02:08,400
>> YOU'RE GONNA STAY ON

88
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,833
HOMEBOUND FROM 10TH GRADE ALL

89
00:02:09,833 --> 00:02:10,500
THE WAY TO 12TH.

90
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,233
>> I SURE AS HELL HOPE SO.

91
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:13,100
I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GONNA

92
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:13,867
HAPPEN.

93
00:02:13,867 --> 00:02:14,833
YOU THINK I'VE CHANGED SINCE

94
00:02:14,833 --> 00:02:16,167
WE FIRST GOT TOGETHER?

95
00:02:16,167 --> 00:02:17,833
>> NO [bleep].

96
00:02:17,833 --> 00:02:19,533
>> I GREW UP, AND YOU DIDN'T.

97
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:20,233
>> EXACTLY.

98
00:02:20,233 --> 00:02:21,400
THAT'S OBVIOUS.

99
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,067
I'M SCARED.

100
00:02:22,067 --> 00:02:22,833
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU.

101
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:23,667
I'M SCARED.

102
00:02:23,667 --> 00:02:24,500
>> YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT ME?

103
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,500
YOU AIN'T THE ONE PUSHING IT OUT

104
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,500
YOUR HOO-HA.

105
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,333
>> [laughs]

106
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:28,200
>> ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT WHEN

107
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,267
THE BABY COMES, WHAT WE'RE GONNA

108
00:02:29,267 --> 00:02:30,400
DO?

109
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,133
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT

110
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:31,767
WE'RE GONNA DO.

111
00:02:31,767 --> 00:02:32,567
>> I MEAN, ARE YOU GONNA STOP

112
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:34,533
PARTYING OR NOT?

113
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,433
>> THAT'S THE SAME THING.

114
00:02:38,433 --> 00:02:40,133
>> NO, IT'S NOT.

115
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:41,867
>> I'M SCARED OF HOW THINGS ARE

116
00:02:41,867 --> 00:02:42,533
GONNA END UP.

117
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:43,800
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GONNA

118
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,567
END UP AS?

119
00:02:44,567 --> 00:02:45,333
>> I DON'T KNOW.

120
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:46,433
IF YOU DON'T STOP PARTYING,

121
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:47,733
I FEEL LIKE I'M GONNA GET MAD AT

122
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:48,867
YOU WHEN THE BABY'S HERE,

123
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:50,200
AND I'M NOT GONNA BITE MY TONGUE

124
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,767
LIKE I DO NOW.

125
00:02:52,767 --> 00:02:54,767
>> I'M GONNA STOP PARTYING AS

126
00:02:54,767 --> 00:02:56,833
MUCH.

127
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:57,633
>> ARE YOU GONNA BE ABLE TO DO

128
00:02:57,633 --> 00:02:58,800
THAT, OR ARE YOU JUST SAYING

129
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,467
THAT?

130
00:02:59,467 --> 00:03:01,533
>> I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO DO IT.

131
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:06,733
>> I'M DUE IN TWO MONTHS,

132
00:03:06,733 --> 00:03:08,167
AND WHILE DUSTIN IS BUSY HANGING

133
00:03:08,167 --> 00:03:09,433
OUT WITH HIS FRIENDS...

134
00:03:09,433 --> 00:03:10,333
>> HAVE YOU GOT STUFF FOR THE

135
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:11,067
BABY?

136
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:12,467
>> HEY, I DON'T HAVE NOTHING.

137
00:03:12,467 --> 00:03:13,633
>> I'M BUSY SETTING UP FOR THE

138
00:03:13,633 --> 00:03:14,300
BABY.

139
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,067
[grunts]

140
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:15,733
OOH.

141
00:03:15,733 --> 00:03:16,400
[chuckles]

142
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,900
WE'RE HAVING A BOY AND NAMING

143
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,067
HIM DRAKE.

144
00:03:19,067 --> 00:03:20,567
OH.

145
00:03:20,567 --> 00:03:23,067
[laughs]

146
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:24,633
OUR PLAN IS TO HAVE BOTH OF US

147
00:03:24,633 --> 00:03:26,233
STAY LIVING WITH OUR MOMS

148
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:27,900
BUT FOR DUSTIN TO HAVE A SETUP

149
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,533
FOR THE BABY AT THEIR PLACE SO

150
00:03:29,533 --> 00:03:31,500
WE CAN STAY THERE TOO.

151
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,067
NOTHING'S THE SAME ANYMORE.

152
00:03:33,067 --> 00:03:33,967
>> IT SEEMS WEIRD BECAUSE YOU

153
00:03:33,967 --> 00:03:36,067
WERE OUT EVERY WEEKEND, AND NOW

154
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:37,400
IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE ALWAYS HERE

155
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,267
DOING MOMMY THINGS.

156
00:03:38,267 --> 00:03:40,133
IT'S KIND OF BIZARRE BUT COOL

157
00:03:40,133 --> 00:03:41,800
BUT WEIRD AT THE SAME TIME.

158
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,833
>> I GOT TO BE A MOMMY.

159
00:03:42,833 --> 00:03:44,100
I CAN'T BE A TEENAGER.

160
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,500
>> IT'S A BIG CHANGE.

161
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,167
>> TRUST ME, I KNOW.

162
00:03:47,167 --> 00:03:48,467
I GAVE UP, LIKE, EVERYTHING

163
00:03:48,467 --> 00:03:50,500
ALREADY.

164
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,567
>> WHEN YOU FIRST TOLD ME YOU

165
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:53,800
WERE PREGNANT, I WAS JUST LIKE,

166
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,733
"NUH-UH," BECAUSE MISTY HAD JUST

167
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:57,167
TOLD ME SHE WAS PREGNANT.

168
00:03:57,167 --> 00:03:59,133
>> AND I WAS SO SICK FOR THAT

169
00:03:59,133 --> 00:03:59,900
WHOLE TIME.

170
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,867
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS WRONG.

171
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:02,933
I THOUGHT I JUST HAD THE FLU,

172
00:04:02,933 --> 00:04:04,833
AND THEN MISTY ASKED IF I WAS

173
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,267
PREGNANT, AND I SAID, "NO."

174
00:04:06,267 --> 00:04:07,200
AND SHE SAID, "LET'S GO TO THE

175
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,433
STORE AND BUY A TEST AND MAKE

176
00:04:08,433 --> 00:04:09,300
SURE."

177
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:10,467
SO WE WENT THERE, BOUGHT THE

178
00:04:10,467 --> 00:04:11,900
TEST, WENT TO THE BATHROOM

179
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,567
STALL.

180
00:04:12,567 --> 00:04:13,367
I COULD TELL YOU WHICH ONE IT

181
00:04:13,367 --> 00:04:14,733
WAS.

182
00:04:14,733 --> 00:04:16,100
TOOK BOTH TESTS, AND MISTY'S

183
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,167
SITTING THERE, "WHAT'S IT SAY?"

184
00:04:18,167 --> 00:04:19,467
AND I'M LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW YET.

185
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,100
IT'S NOT SHOWING."

186
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:23,267
AND THEN IT CAME UP, AND I SAID,

187
00:04:23,267 --> 00:04:24,233
"UH-OH."

188
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:25,800
AND SHE SAID, "LET ME SEE."

189
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,933
AND I SLID IT UNDER THE DOOR.

190
00:04:27,933 --> 00:04:29,833
>> I WAS REALLY ANGRY BECAUSE

191
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,833
I TOOK YOU AND HAD THE BIRTH

192
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,100
CONTROL, FROM PILLS TO RINGS TO

193
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,067
EVERYTHING.

194
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:37,067
>> I DIDN'T WANT TO GET FAT.

195
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:38,267
>> BUT, YEAH, BUT LOOK WHAT

196
00:04:38,267 --> 00:04:39,400
HAPPENED FROM YOU WORRYING ABOUT

197
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:40,767
GAINING FIVE POUNDS.

198
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:42,533
YOU DONE GAINED HOW MANY POUNDS?

199
00:04:42,533 --> 00:04:43,200
>> 40.

200
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,067
>> SEE, YOU GOT TO PROTECT

201
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:44,800
YOURSELF.

202
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,833
IF YOU WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY TOOK

203
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,233
IT CORRECTLY, YOU MIGHT NOT BE

204
00:04:48,233 --> 00:04:49,167
STANDING HERE WITH THAT BIG OLD

205
00:04:49,167 --> 00:04:50,333
BELLY RIGHT NOW.

206
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:51,533
>> I KNOW.

207
00:04:51,533 --> 00:04:53,067
>> ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT HOW

208
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:54,867
IT'S GOING TO CHANGE YOUR LIFE

209
00:04:54,867 --> 00:04:56,400
WITH YOU AND DUSTIN?

210
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:57,067
>> YEAH.

211
00:04:57,067 --> 00:04:57,900
>> IT'S GONNA BE REALLY HARD

212
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,867
WHEN THE BABY DOES COME AND

213
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:01,567
DUSTIN'S WANTING TO STILL HANG

214
00:05:01,567 --> 00:05:03,267
OUT AND DO HIS OWN THING.

215
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:04,067
ARE YOU GONNA BE ALL RIGHT

216
00:05:04,067 --> 00:05:04,833
WITH THAT?

217
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,767
>> NO.

218
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:08,067
>> I REALLY HOPE HE GETS A JOB

219
00:05:08,067 --> 00:05:09,467
BECAUSE THE BABY'S GONNA NEED

220
00:05:09,467 --> 00:05:10,133
FOOD.

221
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:11,467
IT'S GONNA NEED SHELTER.

222
00:05:11,467 --> 00:05:12,833
IT'S GONNA NEED DIAPERS.

223
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:13,767
WHY DO I MAKE YOU--

224
00:05:13,767 --> 00:05:15,067
>> YOU ACT LIKE DUSTIN'S NOT

225
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:17,633
GONNA GET A JOB AT ANY POINT.

226
00:05:17,633 --> 00:05:20,133
>> WELL, I MEAN, ARE YOU FOR

227
00:05:20,133 --> 00:05:21,067
SURE HE'S GONNA PAY CHILD

228
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:22,900
SUPPORT AND FINANCIALLY--

229
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,300
>> I MEAN, IF HE'S HELPING,

230
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,367
HE DOESN'T NEED TO PAY CHILD

231
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:27,133
SUPPORT.

232
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:28,633
HE'LL BE PAYING FOR STUFF WITH

233
00:05:28,633 --> 00:05:29,833
ME.

234
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:31,067
>> DO YOU SEE YOURSELF STILL

235
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:32,633
BEING WITH HIM LATER?

236
00:05:32,633 --> 00:05:34,767
>> HOPEFULLY.

237
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:38,100
HE'S THE ONLY PERSON I'VE LOVED.

238
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,667
MY MOM DOESN'T THINK THAT DUSTIN

239
00:05:39,667 --> 00:05:41,233
IS READY TO BE A RESPONSIBLE

240
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:44,500
DAD, SO SHE WANTS TO TALK THINGS

241
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,233
THROUGH WITH HIM AND HIS MOM.

242
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:48,100
>> FIGURE WE'D GET A LITTLE

243
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,500
GATHERING HERE AND TALK ABOUT

244
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,167
THE BABY.

245
00:05:50,167 --> 00:05:51,300
IT'S BEEN EIGHT MONTHS, AND WE

246
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,233
REALLY HAVEN'T DISCUSSED WHAT

247
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:54,067
WE'RE GONNA DO WITH HIM AND COME

248
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:55,733
TO SOME CONCLUSIONS.

249
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:57,267
DO Y'ALL HAVE A LITTLE SETUP FOR

250
00:05:57,267 --> 00:05:58,100
THE BABY YET?

251
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,833
>> NO, UM, DUSTIN AND I WILL SAY

252
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,067
WE WENT TO A YARD SALE, BOUGHT A

253
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:03,267
CRIB FOR A DOLLAR.

254
00:06:03,267 --> 00:06:04,467
>> ONLY FOR A DOLLAR.

255
00:06:04,467 --> 00:06:05,567
>> BUT I'M NOT TOO FOND OF THE

256
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,333
CRIB.

257
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,200
>> MM-HMM, RIGHT.

258
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,267
>> HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT AFTER

259
00:06:10,267 --> 00:06:11,333
YOU'VE HAD THE BABY WHEN YOU'RE

260
00:06:11,333 --> 00:06:12,633
COMING HOME, WHERE YOU WANTED TO

261
00:06:12,633 --> 00:06:13,967
BE, HOW YOU WANTED IT TO BE?

262
00:06:13,967 --> 00:06:16,067
>> WHEN THE BABY'S FIRST BORN,

263
00:06:16,067 --> 00:06:17,433
I WANT TO GO TO MY HOUSE

264
00:06:17,433 --> 00:06:18,300
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

265
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,067
I'M COMFORTABLE THERE.

266
00:06:19,067 --> 00:06:20,133
>> RIGHT, ABSOLUTELY.

267
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:21,500
>> AND I WANT DUSTIN TO COME

268
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,167
WITH ME.

269
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:23,967
>> I JUST HOPE SHE DON'T GET TOO

270
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:24,833
OVERWHELMED.

271
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:25,800
>> HE'LL BE WITH ME MOST OF THE

272
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,700
TIME, HOPEFULLY.

273
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,067
>> PROBABLY WHENEVER I CAN.

274
00:06:28,067 --> 00:06:28,700
>> YEAH.

275
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,533
DO Y'ALL THINK THAT ME AND

276
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:30,267
DUSTIN ARE GONNA MAKE GOOD

277
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:31,200
PARENTS AND HAVE PREPARED

278
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,233
OURSELF ENOUGH?

279
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:33,067
>> I THINK YOU'RE PREPARING

280
00:06:33,067 --> 00:06:34,067
YOURSELF THE BEST THAT YOU KNOW

281
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:34,733
HOW.

282
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:35,500
I THINK THAT YOU COULD DO A

283
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:36,900
LITTLE MORE PREPARING.

284
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,600
Y'ALL HAVE A LOT THAT Y'ALL ARE

285
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,833
GONNA BE GIVING UP, YOU KNOW,

286
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:40,967
AS FAR AS--

287
00:06:40,967 --> 00:06:41,633
>> PARTYING.

288
00:06:41,633 --> 00:06:43,067
>> UH-HUH, YOU THINK?

289
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:46,300
>> I ALREADY GAVE THAT UP.

290
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:48,167
>> SON, YOU LIVE A LIFE THAT

291
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:49,333
DOESN'T ACCOMMODATE A CHILD

292
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,733
RIGHT NOW.

293
00:06:50,733 --> 00:06:51,400
>> I KNOW THAT.

294
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,600
>> OKAY, SO HOW DO YOU PLAN ON

295
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:54,900
ACCOMMODATING YOUR SON?

296
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,167
>> I NEED TO STOP SMOKING IN THE

297
00:06:56,167 --> 00:06:57,567
HOUSE.

298
00:06:57,567 --> 00:06:58,767
I DEFINITELY WON'T DO THAT OTHER

299
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:00,133
CRAP AROUND HIM.

300
00:07:00,133 --> 00:07:01,133
>> WHAT?

301
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:02,867
>> I'M NOT GONNA BE AROUND HIM,

302
00:07:02,867 --> 00:07:04,833
SMOKE AROUND HIM, OR ANYTHING

303
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,500
WHILE I'M HIGH.

304
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,800
>> SO YOU PLAN ON GETTING HIGH?

305
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,267
>> MOST LIKELY, I MEAN--

306
00:07:10,267 --> 00:07:11,167
>> REALLY?

307
00:07:11,167 --> 00:07:12,067
I'M NOT LAUGHING.

308
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:12,667
I'M NOT--

309
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:13,567
>> I'VE BEEN DOING IT FOR FIVE

310
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:14,167
YEARS.

311
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:14,833
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

312
00:07:14,833 --> 00:07:15,800
>> I DON'T CARE HOW LONG YOU'VE

313
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:16,633
BEEN DOING IT, AND IF YOU THINK

314
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:17,633
FOR ONE--YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME

315
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:18,733
GET LOUD IN THIS RESTAURANT.

316
00:07:18,733 --> 00:07:19,900
>> I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU EXPECT,

317
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,567
MAMA?

318
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:21,367
>> WHERE ARE YOU GONNA GET THE

319
00:07:21,367 --> 00:07:24,500
MONEY TO BUY WEED, SON?

320
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,700
>> PLEASE BE QUIET.

321
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,933
>> THIS IS HOW I KNOW YOU'RE NOT

322
00:07:26,933 --> 00:07:28,233
READY TO BE A FATHER.

323
00:07:28,233 --> 00:07:29,433
YOU'RE NOT EVEN READY TO BE AN

324
00:07:29,433 --> 00:07:30,667
ADULT.

325
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:31,767
>> BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GONNA PLAN

326
00:07:31,767 --> 00:07:32,600
ON SMOKING WEED, YOU'RE AN

327
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,233
IDIOT.

328
00:07:33,233 --> 00:07:34,300
>> YOU ACT LIKE I'M GONNA BE THE

329
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,300
ONE BUYING WEED.

330
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,200
IF SOMEBODY COMES OVER, THE

331
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,300
BABY'S NOT THERE, SOMEONE HAS

332
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,133
WEED, SURE, I'M GONNA TAKE A

333
00:07:38,133 --> 00:07:38,767
HIT.

334
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:41,900
>> NOT IN MY HOME.

335
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,733
YOUR GOAL RIGHT NOW SHOULD BE TO

336
00:07:43,733 --> 00:07:45,133
LIVE LIFE THE BEST WAY THAT YOU

337
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:46,300
CAN FOR YOUR CHILD AND FOR YOUR

338
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:46,967
GIRLFRIEND.

339
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:49,067
OKAY, SO YOUR PLAN SHOULD BE TO

340
00:07:49,067 --> 00:07:51,067
GET A JOB TO FIGURE OUT HOW

341
00:07:51,067 --> 00:07:52,800
YOU'RE GONNA PAY FOR THAT CHILD

342
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,200
TO EAT AND FOR THAT CHILD TO

343
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,767
HAVE WIPES, FOR THAT CHILD TO BE

344
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,767
CLOTHED.

345
00:07:57,767 --> 00:07:59,067
DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IS--

346
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:01,167
>> EVERYBODY SAID I--

347
00:08:01,167 --> 00:08:02,633
I'M TALKING ABOUT WHEN I GO OVER

348
00:08:02,633 --> 00:08:04,267
TO A FRIEND'S HOUSE AND THEY

349
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:05,167
HAVE IT, I MIGHT TAKE A HIT.

350
00:08:05,167 --> 00:08:05,833
THAT'S IT.

351
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:06,733
I MEAN, WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL

352
00:08:06,733 --> 00:08:07,667
ABOUT THAT?

353
00:08:07,667 --> 00:08:08,900
>> IT'S ILLEGAL.

354
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,067
THAT'S THE BIG DEAL.

355
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:12,067
AND YOU HAVE A CHILD COMING.

356
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:18,700
>> [cries]

357
00:08:22,967 --> 00:08:24,967
>> COME HERE.

358
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:31,167
NOW I JUST FEEL LIKE THE BIGGEST

359
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:34,067
ASS[bleep].

360
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:36,767
>> [cries]

361
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:44,933
>> DUSTIN FELT REALLY BAD ABOUT

362
00:08:44,933 --> 00:08:46,367
UPSETTING ME AT LUNCH.

363
00:08:46,367 --> 00:08:47,533
ARE Y'ALL EXCITED TO SEE THE

364
00:08:47,533 --> 00:08:49,067
BABY ON THE SONOGRAM?

365
00:08:49,067 --> 00:08:49,800
>> OH, YEAH.

366
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,700
>> ARE YOU?

367
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,367
>> YEAH.

368
00:08:51,367 --> 00:08:52,433
SO HE PROMISED TO TAKE

369
00:08:52,433 --> 00:08:54,167
FATHERHOOD MORE SERIOUSLY AND TO

370
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:56,900
QUIT SMOKING FOR GOOD.

371
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,600
>> OH, LOOK,

372
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,533
THAT'S HIS NUT SACK.

373
00:08:58,533 --> 00:09:00,100
>> OH, MY GOSH, THAT'S HIS NUTS?

374
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,633
[all laugh]

375
00:09:01,633 --> 00:09:03,100
HE'S EVEN STARTING TO GET HIS

376
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,333
HOUSE READY FOR THE BABY.

377
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,933
YOU THINK WE CAN DO THIS SO WHEN

378
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:06,833
HE LAYS HERE THAT HE DOESN'T GO

379
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:07,467
THROUGH?

380
00:09:07,467 --> 00:09:08,533
>> WE'LL FIGURE THAT OUT WHEN

381
00:09:08,533 --> 00:09:09,233
WE'RE DONE.

382
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:10,233
>> WE'RE GONNA PUT THE CAT IN IT

383
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:11,067
TO TEST IT, RIGHT?

384
00:09:11,067 --> 00:09:12,233
>> NO, JUST PUT THE DOG IN IT.

385
00:09:12,233 --> 00:09:14,067
>> [laughs]

386
00:09:14,067 --> 00:09:15,400
>> OH, IT'S BROKE RIGHT THERE.

387
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,233
>> HOW MUCH DID YOU PAY FOR THIS

388
00:09:16,233 --> 00:09:16,900
AGAIN?

389
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:17,567
>> A DOLLAR.

390
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:18,733
>> THAT'S WHY IT'S BROKE.

391
00:09:18,733 --> 00:09:21,067
>> THIS IS A PIECE OF CRAP CRIB.

392
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:22,667
>> THAT'S WHY IT WAS A DOLLAR.

393
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:23,767
WE'RE NOT PUTTING OUR BABY IN

394
00:09:23,767 --> 00:09:25,767
THIS.

395
00:09:31,533 --> 00:09:32,300
LOOK AT THAT ONE.

396
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,267
THERE'S ONE.

397
00:09:33,267 --> 00:09:35,100
FOR A CRIB, I MEAN, IT'S NOT

398
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:35,767
BAD.

399
00:09:35,767 --> 00:09:37,300
$69.

400
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,267
>> $69, I SEE THAT.

401
00:09:39,267 --> 00:09:41,100
IT'S BETTER THAN THE ONE I GOT.

402
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,133
IT'S STILL TOO MUCH MONEY FOR

403
00:09:42,133 --> 00:09:42,800
ME.

404
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,700
>> YOU DON'T REALIZE HOW MUCH HE

405
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,333
IS GOING TO COST.

406
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,733
>> OBVIOUSLY I CAN SEE.

407
00:09:47,733 --> 00:09:50,433
>> WELL, YOU'RE NOT CARING.

408
00:09:50,433 --> 00:09:51,433
>> WHAT, DO YOU WANT ME TO POOP

409
00:09:51,433 --> 00:09:52,433
OUT MONEY?

410
00:09:52,433 --> 00:09:53,600
>> LIKE, INSTEAD OF RIGHT NOW

411
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,600

412
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,600
FRIENDS AFTER SCHOOL, START

413
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,600
LOOKING FOR A JOB.

414
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,633
YOU NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO

415
00:09:58,633 --> 00:10:01,133
PAY FOR HIM.

416
00:10:10,867 --> 00:10:12,233
I'VE BEEN SO BUSY GETTING

417
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:14,200
EVERYTHING FOR DRAKE, SO TONIGHT

418
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,900
I WANT TO DO SOMETHING FUN.

419
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,667
HEY.

420
00:10:17,667 --> 00:10:18,833
>> HEY, I HAVEN'T SEEN YOU IN

421
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:19,600
FOREVER.

422
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,033
>> HOW IS SCHOOL?

423
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:23,133
>> IT'S SCHOOL.

424
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:25,167
>> I MISS BEING IN 9TH GRADE

425
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:25,900
AGAIN, THOUGH.

426
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:27,667
>> YEAH, I DON'T KNOW; I FEEL

427
00:10:27,667 --> 00:10:29,367
LIKE IT WOULD BE BORING JUST

428
00:10:29,367 --> 00:10:31,333
SITTING AT HOME INSTEAD OF BEING

429
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:33,700
AT SCHOOL, BUT THE WORK IS, UGH.

430
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,833
>> I REMEMBER ME AND YOU SITTING

431
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,167

00:10:37,067 --> 00:10:38,167
BE DOING WORK, AND WE'RE

00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:39,733
LITERALLY JUST GOSSIPING ABOUT

435
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:40,633
DUSTIN.

436
00:10:40,633 --> 00:10:41,900
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

437
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,533
IS HE EXCITED ABOUT THE BABY?

438
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:44,700
>> HE SAYS HE'S NERVOUS,

439
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:45,633
AND THAT'S REALLY ALL HE SAYS IS

440
00:10:45,633 --> 00:10:46,500
HE'S NERVOUS.

441
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,267
>> YEAH.

442
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:48,600
I KNOW HE'S STILL AT SCHOOL,

443
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,233
BUT IS HE PLANNING ON, LIKE,

444
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,500
GETTING A JOB AND EVERYTHING?

445
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,333
>> HE HASN'T BEEN LOOKING.

446
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,233
I'M WORRIED ABOUT HIM BECAUSE

447
00:10:57,233 --> 00:10:58,033
HE'S NOT REALLY BIG ON

448
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:59,400
RESPONSIBILITY.

449
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,067
>> YEAH, WELL, THAT'S ALL

450
00:11:01,067 --> 00:11:03,133
TEENAGE BOYS THESE DAYS.

451
00:11:03,133 --> 00:11:05,200
HOPEFULLY HE CAN FIND SOMETHING.

452
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,200
>> I HOPE HE CAN.

453
00:11:09,433 --> 00:11:10,933
MY MOM WANTS TO HELP DUSTIN FIND

454
00:11:10,933 --> 00:11:12,933

00:11:12,933 --> 00:11:14,600

459
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,767
>> WELL, YOU HELP AROUND THE

461
00:11:22,633 --> 00:11:23,900

464
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:28,900
THEN HE GETS ON THE PHONE,

FOR YOU FOR ONCE.

I'M GLAD YOU CALLED PEOPLE,

497
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,967
BUT YOU NEED TO HAVE A BIT MORE

498
00:12:44,967 --> 00:12:46,600
ENTHUSIASM IN YOUR VOICE.

499
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,700
>> I'M NOT ENTHUSIASTIC.

>> OUR BABY IS DUE IN SEVEN

501
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:53,733
WEEKS, AND I'M GLAD DUSTIN IS

502
00:12:53,733 --> 00:12:54,533

AND HE GOT HIRED AT A LOCAL BIKE

BUT NOT EVERYONE IS CONVINCED

514
00:13:06,733 --> 00:13:08,133
THAT HE'S ON THE RIGHT TRACK.

515
00:13:08,133 --> 00:13:09,733
>> WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ABOUT

516
00:13:09,733 --> 00:13:10,967
DUSTIN LATELY?

517
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:12,400
>> I DON'T REALLY HAVE FAITH

518
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,067
THAT DUSTIN'S GONNA BE A GOOD

519
00:13:14,067 --> 00:13:15,600
DAD OR STICK AROUND.

520
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,500
>> WHY DO YOU SAY THAT, THOUGH?

521
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,633
>> HE DOESN'T ACT LIKE HE FEELS

522
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:19,467
LIKE HE NEEDS TO GROW UP.

523
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:20,533
LIKE, HE JUST ACTS LIKE,

524
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,067
"I'M NOT THE ONE THAT'S PREGNANT

525
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,067
AND I'M NOT THE MOM, SO I'M JUST

526
00:13:24,067 --> 00:13:26,167
GONNA, LIKE, DO WHATEVER I WANT

527
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:27,633
TO DO AND NOT CHANGE A THING

528
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:28,833
ABOUT ANYTHING."

529
00:13:28,833 --> 00:13:29,733
>> BUT, I MEAN, YOU HAVEN'T BEEN

530
00:13:29,733 --> 00:13:31,067
AROUND HIM LATELY.

531
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:32,800
HE DOESN'T SMOKE ANYMORE.

532
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,267
>> DO YOU THINK HE, LIKE, REALLY

533
00:13:34,267 --> 00:13:35,067
QUIT SMOKING?

534
00:13:35,067 --> 00:13:36,500
BECAUSE, LIKE, WHAT HE DOES

535
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,067
WHEN YOU'RE NOT AROUND, LIKE,

536
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:38,900
YOU DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING.

537
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,567
>> I DON'T KNOW.

538
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:41,067
I HAVE FAITH THAT HE'S TELLING

539
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:41,767
THE TRUTH.

540
00:13:41,767 --> 00:13:42,833
>> REALLY, THOUGH?

541
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,967
BECAUSE I THINK YOU NEED TO,

542
00:13:44,967 --> 00:13:46,433
LIKE, WEIGH IT OUT MORE, AND

543
00:13:46,433 --> 00:13:50,633
MAKE HIM PROVE TO YOU THAT HE'S

544
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:53,100
WORTHY OF ACTUALLY BEING A TEEN

545
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,133
DAD AND ACTUALLY STICKING AROUND

546
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:58,633
AND--I MEAN, BECAUSE THIS IS

547
00:13:58,633 --> 00:13:59,867
A LOT OF WORK.

548
00:13:59,867 --> 00:14:01,400
IT MIGHT LOOK LIKE IT'S NOT THAT

549
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,700
BAD, BUT IT'S REALLY HARD,

550
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,633
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO

551
00:14:03,633 --> 00:14:04,700
DO SCHOOL.

552
00:14:04,700 --> 00:14:05,600
AND WHEN YOU'RE, LIKE, GETTING

553
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,133
UP EVERY NIGHT,

554
00:14:07,133 --> 00:14:08,467
AND YOU JUST WANT TO LAY THERE.

555
00:14:08,467 --> 00:14:09,900
LIKE, YOU CAN'T DO THAT ANYMORE

556
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:12,333
BECAUSE HE COMES FIRST.

557
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:15,500
IT'S OKAY, BUDDY.

558
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,300
>> WHAT'S VIBRATING?

559
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:17,667
IS THAT YOU?

560
00:14:17,667 --> 00:14:19,133

>> WHY?

569
00:14:29,867 --> 00:14:30,533
>> HOLD ON.

570
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:33,367
I'M PUTTING YOU ON SPEAKER.

571
00:14:33,367 --> 00:14:34,533
>> THE COPS ARE ON THE WAY TO

572
00:14:34,533 --> 00:14:35,633
DUSTIN'S NOW FOR IT.

573
00:14:35,633 --> 00:14:38,267
WELL, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

574
00:14:41,667 --> 00:14:43,833
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT

575
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,833
TO SAY.

576
00:14:47,933 --> 00:14:49,933
[phone beeps]

577
00:14:51,967 --> 00:14:53,300
>> STILL THINK HE'S READY TO BE

578
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,067
A DAD?

579
00:14:55,067 --> 00:14:57,067
>> I DON'T KNOW.

580
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:11,433
>> AFTER DUSTIN TOLD ME HIS MOM

581
00:15:11,433 --> 00:15:12,467
CALLED THE COPS ON HIM,

582
00:15:12,467 --> 00:15:13,867
I RUSHED OVER.

583
00:15:13,867 --> 00:15:15,867
BUT BY THE TIME I GOT THERE, HIS

584
00:15:15,867 --> 00:15:17,467
MOM HAD CALMED DOWN AND HAD TOLD

585
00:15:17,467 --> 00:15:19,500
THE COPS EVERYTHING WAS OKAY.

586
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,300
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

587
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:23,067
>> SHE CALLED THE COPS BECAUSE

588
00:15:23,067 --> 00:15:24,067
THERE WAS STUFF THAT MY FRIENDS

589
00:15:24,067 --> 00:15:26,200
LEFT HERE LAST NIGHT.

590
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:27,467
SO I JUST PICKED IT UP AND THREW

591
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:28,900
IT AWAY.

592
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:29,767
>> WHEN YOU CALLED RIGHT THERE,

593
00:15:29,767 --> 00:15:30,867
I THOUGHT YOU WERE SMOKING WEED

594
00:15:30,867 --> 00:15:32,233
FROM HOW YOU SAID IT, AND I WAS

595
00:15:32,233 --> 00:15:33,700
PISSED OFF AT YOU.

596
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,367
>> I HAVEN'T DONE IT IN SO LONG.

597
00:15:36,367 --> 00:15:38,933
>> I MEAN, I HOPE NOT.

598
00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:47,633
>> HEY, SWEETIE,

599
00:15:47,633 --> 00:15:48,600
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

600
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:49,667
>> DO YOU WANT TO SIT DOWN?

601
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:50,567
>> SURE.

602
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:52,167
SO WHAT HAPPENED WITH DUSTIN

603
00:15:52,167 --> 00:15:53,600
WITH THE COPS AND EVERYTHING?

604
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,600
I THOUGHT HE STOPPED AND

605
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:55,267
STRAIGHTENED UP.

606
00:15:55,267 --> 00:15:56,233
>> HE SAYS HE HAS.

607
00:15:56,233 --> 00:15:56,900
I BELIEVE HIM.

608
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,733
I MEAN, I'M WITH HIM, LIKE,

609
00:15:57,733 --> 00:16:00,067
ALMOST EVERY SINGLE DAY.

610
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:01,367
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM SMOKE.

611
00:16:01,367 --> 00:16:03,433
I HAVEN'T SMELT SMOKE ON HIM.

612
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:04,433
>> WELL, I GOT A QUESTION

613
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:05,100
FOR YOU.

614
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:06,333
LIKE YOU DO A HOME PREGNANCY

615
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:07,967
TEST, DON'T THEY GOT THE HOME

616
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:10,267
DRUG TESTS SO YOU GOT KIND OF AN

617
00:16:10,267 --> 00:16:12,700
IDEA?

618
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,633
>> THAT'S FINE.

619
00:16:15,633 --> 00:16:17,100
>> BUT YOU DO KNOW IF IT'S

620
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:19,067
POSITIVE, THAT'S GONNA BE UGLY.

621
00:16:19,067 --> 00:16:21,067
>> YEAH.

622
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,067
BETWEEN THE STRESS OF KEEPING UP

623
00:16:25,067 --> 00:16:28,067
WITH MY SCHOOLWORK

624
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:29,867
AND MAKING SURE THAT EVERYTHING

625
00:16:29,867 --> 00:16:31,700
IS READY FOR THE BABY, I'M ALSO

626
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,067
WORRIED THAT DUSTIN HAS BEEN

627
00:16:33,067 --> 00:16:35,067
LYING TO ME.

628
00:16:35,067 --> 00:16:35,833
>> CAN I SEE IT?

629
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:36,500
>> YEAH.

630
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,333
>> WHICH ONE DID YOU GET?

631
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:39,600
>> IT COVERS FOUR DIFFERENT

632
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,800
DRUGS: MARIJUANA, METHADONE,

633
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,667
COCAINE, AND...

634
00:16:46,667 --> 00:16:48,667
OPIATES.

635
00:16:52,433 --> 00:16:54,400
>> SO HAVE YOU STOPPED TOTALLY

636
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:56,767
SMOKING POT?

637
00:16:56,767 --> 00:16:57,933
100%?

638
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:58,733
>> YUP.

639
00:16:58,733 --> 00:16:59,500
>> ARE YOU DOING IT FOR THE

640
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,133
BABY OR FOR YOU OR FOR BOTH?

641
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:02,133
>> PROBABLY FOR BOTH.

642
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:03,067
>> THAT'S THE BEST ANSWER

643
00:17:03,067 --> 00:17:03,667
I CAN HEAR.

644
00:17:03,667 --> 00:17:04,867
YOU SHOULD WANT IT FOR YOURSELF

645
00:17:04,867 --> 00:17:05,533
ALSO.

646
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:07,067
BECAUSE THE BETTER YOU ARE, THE

647
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,333
BETTER YOU ARE FOR YOUR CHILD.

648
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,400
>> WELL, IF YOU TOOK A DRUG TEST

649
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,267
RIGHT NOW, DO YOU THINK YOU'D

00:17:11,267 --> 00:17:12,900
PASS?

651
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:13,567
>> PROBABLY.

652
00:17:13,567 --> 00:17:15,567
>> WHY DON'T YOU GO TAKE THAT?

653
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,567
>> HELL NO.

654
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,867
I'M NOT TAKING THAT.

655
00:17:18,867 --> 00:17:22,500
>> TAKE IT.

656
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,333
>> "TEST FOR MARIJUANA, COCAINE,

657
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:25,900
METHAMPHETAMINE, AND OPIATES."

658
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:27,100
>> WILL YOU GO TAKE THE DRUG

659
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:29,067
TEST NOW IN THE BATHROOM?

660
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:32,133
>> I CAN'T DO THAT.

661
00:17:34,933 --> 00:17:35,867
>> GO TAKE THE TEST.

662
00:17:35,867 --> 00:17:36,533

663
00:17:36,533 --> 00:17:37,200

00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:37,867
>> MM-MM.

665
00:17:37,867 --> 00:17:38,533
>> GO TAKE THE TEST.

666
00:17:38,533 --> 00:17:40,333
>> WANT MY ICE?

667
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,367
>> NO, GO TAKE THE TEST.

668
00:17:41,367 --> 00:17:42,367
>> I'M NOT TAKING THE TEST HERE.

669
00:17:42,367 --> 00:17:44,667

671
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:46,400

673
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,067
>> I BET YOU DO.

674
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:48,733
>> GOOD LUCK.

675
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:49,767
>> GOOD LUCK?

676
00:17:49,767 --> 00:17:51,367
>> THE BABY SAYS GOOD LUCK.

677
00:17:51,367 --> 00:17:53,967
>> THAT IS SO MEAN.

678
00:17:56,433 --> 00:17:57,800
>> I REALLY HOPE HE PASSES.

679
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:58,867
>> I REALLY, REALLY HOPE HE

680
00:17:58,867 --> 00:17:59,533
PASSES.

681
00:17:59,533 --> 00:18:02,200
DO YOU THINK HE'S GOING TO?

682
00:18:32,767 --> 00:18:33,600
>> SO I SEEN YOU TURN AROUND

683
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:34,800
LOOKING.

684
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,700
YOU HEARD A DOOR, AND YOU TURN

685
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,633
AROUND QUICK.

686
00:18:37,633 --> 00:18:40,800
I JUST TELL YOU'RE VERY NERVOUS.

687
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,067
I WONDER HOW NERVOUS HE IS RIGHT

688
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:43,600
AT THIS SECOND.

689
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,933
>> HE'S PROBABLY MISSING.

690
00:18:44,933 --> 00:18:46,600
HE'S COMING.

691
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,067
>> I DON'T KNOW.

692
00:18:49,067 --> 00:18:50,533
READ THIS.

693
00:18:50,533 --> 00:18:51,967
WHAT DOES TWO LINES MEAN

694
00:18:51,967 --> 00:18:53,967
AND WHAT DOES ONE LINE MEAN?

695
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:54,900
>> WHERE'S YOUR TEST?

696
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:55,600
>> IN HERE.

697
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,500
>> GIVE ME THE TEST.

698
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,433
>> THERE'S TWO LINES ON ALL OF

699
00:18:57,433 --> 00:18:59,667
THEM.

700
00:18:59,667 --> 00:19:01,100
>> WHERE'S THE BOX?

701
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:02,067
>> THAT'S THE INSTRUCTIONS.

702
00:19:02,067 --> 00:19:02,700
THERE ISN'T A BOX.

703
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,700
>> OH, HE HAS IT RIGHT THERE.

704
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:10,333
>> NEGATIVE.

705
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,067
>> ON WHAT?

706
00:19:11,067 --> 00:19:12,467
>> YOU PASSED.

707
00:19:12,467 --> 00:19:13,167
>> DID HE REALLY?

708
00:19:13,167 --> 00:19:14,400
>> HE PASSED, NEGATIVE.

709
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,167
>> EVEN IF IT'S STAYING?

710
00:19:15,167 --> 00:19:17,067
>> T.H.C., HE PASSED.

711
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:18,500
O.P.I., HE PASSED.

712
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,467
>> OPIATE.

713
00:19:19,467 --> 00:19:20,600
>> METHADONE, HE PASSED.

714
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,767
COCAINE, HE PASSED.

715
00:19:21,767 --> 00:19:23,300
HE PASSED EVERYTHING.

716
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,300
HE BARELY IS PASSING HIS T.H.C.

717
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,600
ONE, THOUGH, BUT SINCE THERE'S

718
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,200
TWO LINES STILL--

719
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,200
>> IT'S STILL CLASSIFIED AS

720
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:29,867
PASSING.

721
00:19:29,867 --> 00:19:30,533
>> HE PASSED.

722
00:19:30,533 --> 00:19:31,767
>> OH, MY GOD.

723
00:19:31,767 --> 00:19:34,200
[all laugh]

724
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:34,867
>> TAKE A PICTURE.

725
00:19:34,867 --> 00:19:36,200
SHOW YOUR MOMMY.

726
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,467
AND SAY, "WHAT?"

727
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:38,633
[laughs]

728
00:19:38,633 --> 00:19:40,133
>> I'M SO PROUD OF YOU, DUSTIN.

729
00:19:40,133 --> 00:19:40,800
>> ME TOO.

730
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,900
>> PLEASE KEEP IT UP.

731
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:44,133
>> NO MORE WEED.

732
00:19:44,133 --> 00:19:45,500
>> THAT'S THE FIRST DRUG TEST

733
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,667
I'VE EVER PASSED.

734
00:19:46,667 --> 00:19:47,500
>> REALLY?

735
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,533
>> HIGH FIVE, DUDE.

736
00:19:48,533 --> 00:19:49,200
>> TWO.

737
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,700
>> HEY.

738
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,300
>> YOUR HAND WAS WET.

739
00:19:52,300 --> 00:19:53,667
I'M HAPPY THAT DUSTIN IS DOING

740
00:19:53,667 --> 00:19:55,367
THE RIGHT THINGS FOR OUR BABY.

741
00:19:55,367 --> 00:19:57,700
>> OKAY, LET'S DO SOME BRACKETS.

742
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,767
>> HE'S NOT PERFECT, BUT HE'S AS

743
00:19:59,767 --> 00:20:01,333
READY FOR FATHERHOOD AS HE'LL

744
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,500
EVER BE.

745
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,167
WHAT THE HELL IS IT?

746
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:07,867
>> IT'S A BELLY MOLD.

747
00:20:07,867 --> 00:20:08,733
>> WHAT?

748
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:10,633
>> YOU MAKE YOUR BELLY.

749
00:20:10,633 --> 00:20:11,833
>> AND IT STAYS LIKE THAT?

750
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:12,967
>> YEAH.

751
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:14,100
>> THAT'S [bleep] SWEET.

752
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,933
>> OW, I'M HAVING A CONTRACTION.

753
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:17,600
>> AGAIN?

754
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,100
WHAT THE HELL IS A CONTRACTION?

755
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,067
>> WHAT?

756
00:20:20,067 --> 00:20:21,167
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

757
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:23,100
>> I FORGOT.

758
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,567
>> IT'S WHEN THE BABY IS GETTING

759
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:25,233
READY TO COME.

760
00:20:25,233 --> 00:20:27,933
>> YOUR STOMACH IS ROCK HARD.

761
00:20:27,933 --> 00:20:29,533
>> THAT'S CALLED A CONTRACTION,

762
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:31,533
YOU DUMMY.

763
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:35,333
OH, COLD, COLD, COLD.

764
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,333
AND I'M HAVING A CONTRACTION.

765
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,867
MY DUE DATE IS STILL A MONTH

766
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,500
AWAY, BUT SINCE I'VE BEEN HAVING

767
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,600
CONTRACTIONS MORE FREQUENTLY,

768
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,933
WE'RE GOING TO THE DOCTOR TO

769
00:20:47,933 --> 00:20:49,767
MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS OKAY.

770
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:51,100
>> THE HEAD'S DOWN ON THE

771
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:51,867
PELVIS.

772
00:20:51,867 --> 00:20:52,867
IT'S JUST SORT OF SITTING RIGHT

773
00:20:52,867 --> 00:20:53,533
THERE.

774
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:54,967
>> OH, YOU CAN FEEL IT?

775
00:20:54,967 --> 00:20:55,633
>> YEAH.

776
00:20:55,633 --> 00:20:57,100
>> THAT'S CRAZY, DOG.

777
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:59,100
>> I WOULDN'T BE SHOCKED IF YOU

778
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,600
DIDN'T DELIVER IN THE NEXT WEEK

779
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,767
OR 10 DAYS.

780
00:21:01,767 --> 00:21:02,433
>> MM-KAY.

781
00:21:02,433 --> 00:21:03,467
>> BUT IT COULD BE LONGER.

782
00:21:03,467 --> 00:21:04,333
YOU COULD GO ALL THE WAY TO

783
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:05,767
TERM, SO WE'LL SEE.

784
00:21:05,767 --> 00:21:07,100
>> LET'S HOPE NOT.

785
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,400
TURNS OUT, I DIDN'T HAVE

786
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,433
TO WAIT LONG.

787
00:21:09,433 --> 00:21:10,933
A FEW DAYS LATER, MY

788
00:21:10,933 --> 00:21:12,333
CONTRACTIONS STARTED UP AGAIN...

789
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:13,167
[sighs]

790
00:21:13,167 --> 00:21:14,467
MOM!

791
00:21:14,467 --> 00:21:15,833
AND DIDN'T STOP.

792
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:16,733
>> WHAT'S WRONG?

793
00:21:16,733 --> 00:21:18,067
>> I THINK THE BABY'S COMING.

794
00:21:18,067 --> 00:21:19,633
WILL YOU GO CALL DUSTIN?

795
00:21:19,633 --> 00:21:20,700
>> YEAH, HONEY.

796
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,600
>> WHEN I ARRIVED AT THE

797
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,300
HOSPITAL, I WAS FOUR CENTIMETERS

798
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,800
DILATED, AND THE CONTRACTIONS

799
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:27,833
WERE BECOMING REALLY PAINFUL.

800
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,433
THEN THE DOCTOR BROKE MY WATER

801
00:21:29,433 --> 00:21:31,433
AND GAVE ME PITOCIN.

802
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,500
I'M SO SCARED.

803
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:36,900
I'M PETRIFIED.

804
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,733
WE GONNA GET MY TUBES TIED.

805
00:21:38,733 --> 00:21:39,867
NO MORE BABIES.

806
00:21:39,867 --> 00:21:42,067
WE GONNA GET BIRTH CONTROL,

807
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:42,900
AND YOU GONNA LEARN HOW TO PUT

808
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,467
ON A CONDOM.

809
00:21:44,467 --> 00:21:45,500
>> YOU SCARED?

810
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,067
>> IT'S JUST THE THOUGHT OF THE

811
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:48,967
VAGINA RIPPING OPEN IS WHAT'S

812
00:21:48,967 --> 00:21:52,267
SCARING ME.

813
00:21:58,067 --> 00:21:59,833
AFTER A FEW HOURS, THE PAIN

814
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:01,767
BECAME UNBEARABLE, SO I ASKED

815
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:04,900
FOR AN EPIDURAL.

816
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,100
I WAS GLAD I HAD MY WHOLE FAMILY

817
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,967
AND DUSTIN THERE WITH ME.

818
00:22:12,967 --> 00:22:13,733
>> ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO

819
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:14,400
SLEEP?

820
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,833
>> [bleep], YEAH.

821
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:18,600
SHE DON'T CARE.

822
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,333
>> BEFORE I KNEW IT, IT WAS TIME

823
00:22:20,333 --> 00:22:21,500
TO START PUSHING.

824
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,300
>> ALL RIGHT, GO BACK ON YOUR

00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:22,933

826
00:22:22,933 --> 00:22:23,967
>> MOMMY.

827
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,067

PUSH HARD RIGHT HERE.

830
00:22:27,067 --> 00:22:27,667
PUSH HARD.

I WANT YOU TO PUSH...

00:25:15,567 --> 00:25:18,767
RIGHT NOW.

937
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,067
>> GET IT UNDER HIS BALLS.

938
00:25:20,067 --> 00:25:24,233
MOVE HIS BALLS AROUND.

939
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:27,233
[baby crying]

940
00:25:29,067 --> 00:25:30,667
>> I KNOW, BUDDY.

941
00:25:30,667 --> 00:25:33,300
IT'S OKAY.

942
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,300
[baby crying]

943
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,067
>> [mumbles]

944
00:25:42,067 --> 00:25:44,700
[sighs]

945
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,833
ARE YOU GONNA HELP ME?

946
00:25:45,833 --> 00:25:47,267
>> HOW?

947
00:25:47,267 --> 00:25:49,500
>> MY LEGS.

948
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,300
PULL.

949
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:52,300
>> I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU.

950
00:25:55,767 --> 00:25:58,767
[baby crying]

951
00:26:04,133 --> 00:26:05,600
>> TAKING CARE OF A BABY IS WAY

952
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,233
HARDER THAN I IMAGINED.

953
00:26:07,233 --> 00:26:07,933
>> YOU NEED AN ASPIRIN?

954
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:08,633
YOUR HEAD HURTING?

955
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:10,300
>> I'M JUST TIRED.

956
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:12,067
>> YOU LOOK IT.

957
00:26:12,067 --> 00:26:13,633
>> AND TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH MY

958
00:26:13,633 --> 00:26:15,667
SCHOOLWORK IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE.

959
00:26:17,533 --> 00:26:19,400
I REALLY WISH I HAD DUSTIN'S

960
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,433
HELP, BUT DAYS GO BY WHERE I

961
00:26:21,433 --> 00:26:22,500
DON'T SEE HIM AT ALL.

962
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,733
AND WHEN HE DOES COME OVER,

963
00:26:23,733 --> 00:26:26,667
HE'S USUALLY SLACKING OFF.

964
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:28,267
>> DUDE, DID HE JUST FART?

965
00:26:28,267 --> 00:26:29,933
>> HE [bleep].

966
00:26:29,933 --> 00:26:30,633
>> YOU'RE CHANGING.

967
00:26:30,633 --> 00:26:31,333
>> YOU GONNA CHANGE IT?

968
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:32,167
>> NO, YOU'RE CHANGING IT.

969
00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:32,933
>> YOU'RE CHANGING IT.

970
00:26:32,933 --> 00:26:33,767
>> NO, YOU'RE CHANGING IT.

971
00:26:33,767 --> 00:26:34,500
>> YOUR STUPID GAME IS NOT

972
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:34,967
IMPORTANT.

973
00:26:34,967 --> 00:26:35,733
>> IT IS IMPORTANT.

974
00:26:35,733 --> 00:26:37,067
>> CAN YOU BE A PARENT INSTEAD

975
00:26:37,067 --> 00:26:39,100
OF A TEENAGER FOR FIVE SECONDS?

976
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,633
>> I'M ON THE FINAL LAP.

977
00:26:40,633 --> 00:26:41,867
>> GET UP.

978
00:26:41,867 --> 00:26:42,967
AND TO TOP IT OFF, HE HASN'T

979
00:26:42,967 --> 00:26:44,433
SPENT ANY OF HIS PAYCHECKS ON

980
00:26:44,433 --> 00:26:45,600
DIAPERS OR WIPES.

981
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,967
ONLY SEVEN DIAPERS.

982
00:26:46,967 --> 00:26:48,533
THAT'S [bleep].

983
00:26:48,533 --> 00:26:49,900
STUPID.

984
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,067
[knock on door]

985
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,133
>> COME IN.

986
00:26:52,133 --> 00:26:52,800
HEY.

987
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:54,567
>> HOLA.

988
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:55,700
>> WELL, AUTUMN'S IN THE ROOM.

989
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,500
YOU WANT TO GO CHECK HER OUT?

990
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,600
THE BABY'S IN THERE.

991
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,300
>> YEAH, SCREW AUTUMN.

992
00:26:58,300 --> 00:26:59,067
I WANT THE BABY.

993
00:26:59,067 --> 00:27:01,833
>> YOU WANT THE BABY.

994
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:03,067
>> GIVE ME MY SON.

995
00:27:03,067 --> 00:27:04,067
HEY, DOES THIS HURT?

996
00:27:04,067 --> 00:27:05,067
>> STOP TOUCHING ME.

997
00:27:05,067 --> 00:27:05,933
YOU'RE BEING IMMATURE.

998
00:27:05,933 --> 00:27:06,733
>> I'M NOT TOUCHING YOU.

999
00:27:06,733 --> 00:27:07,667
YOU'RE TOUCHING ME, SEE?

1000
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:08,667
>> YOU'RE--BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO

1001
00:27:08,667 --> 00:27:11,200
KEEP YOU AWAY FROM ME.

1002
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,400
>> BRING ANY DIAPERS?

1003
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,467
>> NO.

1004
00:27:13,467 --> 00:27:14,333
IF YOU WOULD'VE TOLD ME,

1005
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:15,067
I MIGHT HAVE.

1006
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:16,567
>> OH, REALLY?

1007
00:27:16,567 --> 00:27:17,233
>> YEAH.

1008
00:27:17,233 --> 00:27:18,100
>> WHY DON'T YOU DO THE NICE

1009
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:20,067
THING AND JUST, "HERE, AUTUMN,

1010
00:27:20,067 --> 00:27:21,600
LET ME--LET ME HELP YOU OUT SO

1011
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,433
YOU CAN GO GET YOUR EYEBROWS

1012
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:23,333
DONE LIKE YOU'VE BEEN WANTING TO

1013
00:27:23,333 --> 00:27:24,067
DO FOR MONTHS."

1014
00:27:24,067 --> 00:27:25,233
>> HOW MANY DIAPERS YOU GOT?

1015
00:27:25,233 --> 00:27:26,800
>> A BOX.

1016
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,367
>> THAT'LL LAST A WEEK AT LEAST.

1017
00:27:28,367 --> 00:27:29,733
>> WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT WEEK?

1018
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:30,933
>> WE BUY MORE.

1019
00:27:30,933 --> 00:27:31,600
>> WE?

1020
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,267
>> WE.

1021
00:27:32,267 --> 00:27:32,933
>> OR ME?

1022
00:27:32,933 --> 00:27:33,933
>> I'LL GIVE YOU $2.50 RIGHT

1023
00:27:33,933 --> 00:27:34,600
NOW.

1024
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,733
>> THAT GETS THIS.

1025
00:27:35,733 --> 00:27:36,933
THAT'S LITERALLY HOW MUCH THIS

1026
00:27:36,933 --> 00:27:38,433
IS, $2.50 JUST FOR THIS.

1027
00:27:38,433 --> 00:27:39,300
>> THAT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING.

1028
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,067
>> YOU KNOW HOW FAST YOU GO

1029
00:27:40,067 --> 00:27:40,667
THROUGH THIS?

1030
00:27:40,667 --> 00:27:41,333
TWO DAYS.

1031
00:27:41,333 --> 00:27:42,200
>> THAT'S BETTER THAN NOTHING.

1032
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,100
>> TWO DAYS.

1033
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,067
>> HERE, YOU CAN COUNT THAT OUT.

1034
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,667
>> THIS ALL YOU GOT?

1035
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:53,967
>> FOR NOW, YEAH.

1036
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,767
>> LOOK AT THIS DOLLAR, DRAKE.

1037
00:27:57,767 --> 00:27:58,967
IT'S THE FIRST DOLLAR YOUR DADDY

1038
00:27:58,967 --> 00:28:00,600
GAVE YOU.

1039
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,867
PUT IT IN YOUR PIGGY BANK.

1040
00:28:02,867 --> 00:28:04,533
I REALLY THOUGHT DUSTIN WAS

1041
00:28:04,533 --> 00:28:07,567
GONNA STAY ON THE RIGHT TRACK.

1042
00:28:07,567 --> 00:28:09,300
BUT NOW I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT HE'S

1043
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,300
SPENDING HIS PAYCHECK ON.

1044
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,700
>> OH, SOMETHING FOR DRAKE.

1045
00:28:16,467 --> 00:28:17,667
OH.

1046
00:28:17,667 --> 00:28:18,933
>> WHAT?

1047
00:28:18,933 --> 00:28:20,267
>> HE HAD HIS CIRCUMCISION BILL,

1048
00:28:20,267 --> 00:28:21,467
AND THE INSURANCE DIDN'T COVER

1049
00:28:21,467 --> 00:28:23,667
IT, AND IT'S FOR $287.

1050
00:28:23,667 --> 00:28:24,533
>> LET ME READ IT.

1051
00:28:24,533 --> 00:28:27,467
>> OH, MY GOODNESS.

1052
00:28:27,467 --> 00:28:30,767
YOU KNOW WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT.

1053
00:28:30,767 --> 00:28:31,533
>> I KNOW.

1054
00:28:31,533 --> 00:28:33,333
>> AND THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.

1055
00:28:33,333 --> 00:28:34,400
YOU MIGHT NEED TO GIVE DUSTIN A

1056
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:35,500
CALL ABOUT THIS.

1057
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,367
>> I'LL SAY SOMETHING TO HIM,

1058
00:28:36,367 --> 00:28:37,200
BUT HE AIN'T GONNA PAY IT.

1059
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,433
HE'S GONNA LAUGH.

1060
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:42,100
>> SO BASICALLY WE GOT TO PAY

1061
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:44,067
FOR ALL THE DIAPERS AND THE

1062
00:28:44,067 --> 00:28:46,067
WIPES, AND HE JUST COMES TO PLAY

1063
00:28:46,067 --> 00:28:47,200
WITH HIM, RIGHT?

1064
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:48,667
>> YEAH, PRETTY MUCH.

1065
00:28:48,667 --> 00:28:49,933
>> I KNOW YOU SAID BEFORE YOU

1066
00:28:49,933 --> 00:28:50,767
DIDN'T WANT TO DO THE CHILD

1067
00:28:50,767 --> 00:28:52,067
SUPPORT, BUT AT THIS POINT,

1068
00:28:52,067 --> 00:28:52,933
HE'S WORKING.

1069
00:28:52,933 --> 00:28:55,133
HE STILL HASN'T CAME AND BOUGHT

1070
00:28:55,133 --> 00:28:56,433
ANYTHING FOR HIM.

1071
00:28:56,433 --> 00:28:57,133
>> I FEEL STUCK.

1072
00:28:57,133 --> 00:28:59,300
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO BECAUSE

1073
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:00,533
HE WAS DOING GOOD, YOU KNOW,

1074
00:29:00,533 --> 00:29:02,433
QUIT WEED AND ALL THAT AND HE

1075
00:29:02,433 --> 00:29:03,600
GOT A JOB.

1076
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,100
BUT NOW THERE'S NOTHING--

1077
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,433
HE'S NOT DOING ANYTHING.

1078
00:29:07,433 --> 00:29:08,933
>> LIKE I SAID, THE CHILD

1079
00:29:08,933 --> 00:29:10,200
SUPPORT'S THE ONLY WAY I CAN

1080
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,533
EVEN THINK OF TO EVEN SCARE HIM

1081
00:29:12,533 --> 00:29:13,333
TO MAKE HIM DO WHAT HE'S

1082
00:29:13,333 --> 00:29:13,967
SUPPOSED TO DO.

1083
00:29:13,967 --> 00:29:15,333
AND I THINK AFTER A LITTLE BIT

1084
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:16,133
OF TIME, YOU'RE GONNA GET

1085
00:29:16,133 --> 00:29:16,767
REALLY FRUSTRATED.

1086
00:29:16,767 --> 00:29:19,233
MY PERSONAL OPINION, YOU NEED TO

1087
00:29:19,233 --> 00:29:21,367
TAKE THE NEXT STEP AND TO MAKE

1088
00:29:21,367 --> 00:29:23,500
HIM DO IT.

1089
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,933
>> THINGS BETWEEN DUSTIN AND I

1090
00:29:24,933 --> 00:29:26,433
HAVE NOT BEEN SAME SINCE DRAKE

1091
00:29:26,433 --> 00:29:27,967
ARRIVED.

1092
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:29,500
BUT BEFORE I FILE FOR CHILD

1093
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,167
SUPPORT, I WANT TO GIVE HIM ONE

1094
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:34,467
MORE CHANCE TO STEP UP.

1095
00:29:38,133 --> 00:29:40,067
I HAVE PHYSICALLY AND

1096
00:29:40,067 --> 00:29:41,100
FINANCIALLY PAID FOR EVERY

1097
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,200
SINGLE THING THAT THAT BOY HAS.

1098
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:42,867
>> SAYS YOU.

1099
00:29:42,867 --> 00:29:45,367
>> YEAH.

1100
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:46,200
YOU DON'T TAKE CARE OF HIM.

1101
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,067
I DO.

1102
00:29:47,067 --> 00:29:48,933
YOU HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING.

1103
00:29:48,933 --> 00:29:51,533
>> BULLCRAP.

1104
00:29:51,533 --> 00:29:52,533
>> NAME ONE THING YOU'VE BOUGHT

1105
00:29:52,533 --> 00:29:53,333
HIM.

1106
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,700
>> I HAVEN'T DONE--I HAVEN'T--

1107
00:29:54,700 --> 00:29:55,767
I HAVEN'T TAKEN CARE OF HIM LIKE

1108
00:29:55,767 --> 00:29:58,267
THAT, BUT...

1109
00:29:58,267 --> 00:29:59,667
>> YOU THINK YOU DON'T HAVE TO?

1110
00:29:59,667 --> 00:30:00,767
>> NO, I KNOW I GOT TO.

1111
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:01,433
I WILL.

1112
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:02,633
>> YOU JUST GO BUY A PACK OF

1113
00:30:02,633 --> 00:30:05,033
DIAPERS EVERY WEEK ON FRIDAY

1114
00:30:05,033 --> 00:30:05,833
WHEN YOU GET A PAYCHECK AND A

1115
00:30:05,833 --> 00:30:08,233
BOX OF WIPIES, AND I'LL BE FINE.

1116
00:30:08,233 --> 00:30:09,000
>> ALL RIGHT, BOX OF--WHOA,

1117
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:09,700
WHOA, WHOA.

1118
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:10,533

00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:54,067
SCHOOL WITHOUT HELP FROM DUSTIN?

1303
00:35:54,067 --> 00:35:55,367
>> I MEAN, I GOT ALL A's AND B's

1304
00:35:55,367 --> 00:35:56,600
RIGHT NOW.

1305
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:59,067
AND ALL MY WORK GETS DONE.

1306
00:35:59,067 --> 00:36:00,367
EVEN IF IT'S LATE, IT ALL GETS

1307
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:01,100
DONE.

1308
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,767
MOM HELPS ME WITH HIM A LOT,

1309
00:36:03,767 --> 00:36:05,533
AND, LIKE, IF I'M TIRED.

1310
00:36:05,533 --> 00:36:06,367
BUT I KNOW I NEED TO GET

1311
00:36:06,367 --> 00:36:08,167
SCHOOLWORK DONE, AND I CAN'T

1312
00:36:08,167 --> 00:36:09,867
JUGGLE BOTH AT THE SAME TIME.

1313
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,200
>> DON'T YOU FEEL LIKE THAT

1314
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,400
SHOULD BE DUSTIN'S PLACE THOUGH,

1315
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,067
NOT MOM'S, CONSIDERING IT'S

1316
00:36:14,067 --> 00:36:15,067
DUSTIN'S KID?

1317
00:36:15,067 --> 00:36:17,200
>> I'M FED UP WITH DUSTIN.

1318
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,067
>> SO YOU SHOULD GET CHILD

1319
00:36:18,067 --> 00:36:18,667
SUPPORT.

1320
00:36:18,667 --> 00:36:19,833
IT SHOULDN'T BE A QUESTION.

1321
00:36:19,833 --> 00:36:20,967
>> MM.

1322
00:36:20,967 --> 00:36:23,533
[sniffles]

1323
00:36:23,533 --> 00:36:24,467
>> I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE DOING

1324
00:36:24,467 --> 00:36:26,100
WHAT'S RIGHT FOR DRAKE AS A MOM

1325
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,667
AND NOT CARING ABOUT HOW DUSTIN

1326
00:36:27,667 --> 00:36:29,500
FEELS.

1327
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:32,100
>> [sighs]

1328
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:36,267
>> ARE YOU NERVOUS?

1329
00:36:36,267 --> 00:36:39,500
>> A LITTLE.

1330
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,067
I KNOW THAT FILING FOR CHILD

1331
00:36:41,067 --> 00:36:42,200
SUPPORT IS THE RIGHT THING TO

1332
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,200
DO, BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW DUSTIN

1333
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,600
WILL REACT.

1334
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:00,967
NO, I DON'T NEED HELP.

1335
00:37:00,967 --> 00:37:01,633
THANK YOU.

1336
00:37:01,633 --> 00:37:02,333
>> I KNOW YOU DON'T.

1337
00:37:02,333 --> 00:37:03,300
OH, LOOK AT HIM.

1338
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:05,833
HE'S AWAKE.

1339
00:37:05,833 --> 00:37:07,167
>> WHAT YOU DONE TODAY?

1340
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:08,767
>> NOTHING. SCHOOL.

1341
00:37:08,767 --> 00:37:11,067
>> I GOT SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.

1342
00:37:11,067 --> 00:37:13,333
IT'S KIND OF DIFFICULT TO SAY.

1343
00:37:13,333 --> 00:37:14,767
>> IS IT BAD?

1344
00:37:14,767 --> 00:37:16,300
>> NOT ON MY BEHALF.

1345
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,433
IT MIGHT BE ON YOURS.

1346
00:37:17,433 --> 00:37:18,667
>> THEN I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

1347
00:37:18,667 --> 00:37:19,900
>> WELL, YOU HAVE TO KNOW.

1348
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,767
>> I DON'T WANT TO KNOW.

1349
00:37:21,767 --> 00:37:23,533
>> WELL, I FILED FOR CHILD

1350
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,533
SUPPORT.

1351
00:37:26,933 --> 00:37:27,967
>> YOU'RE NOT HELPING AT ALL.

1352
00:37:27,967 --> 00:37:28,900
YOU HAVEN'T BOUGHT THE FIRST

1353
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,733
THING FOR HIM.

1354
00:37:30,733 --> 00:37:33,067
AND, I MEAN, YOU'RE NOT AROUND

1355
00:37:33,067 --> 00:37:35,233
THAT MUCH.

1356
00:37:35,233 --> 00:37:37,900
AND I NEED HELP.

1357
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,600
>> DUSTIN, STOP.

1358
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,467
>> I WANT TO SEE HIM SMILE.

1359
00:37:43,467 --> 00:37:46,500
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN A WHILE.

1360
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,733
>> YOU GONNA TALK TO ME?

1361
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:49,133
>> I DON'T WANT TO.

1362
00:37:49,133 --> 00:37:50,967
>> WELL, YOU SHOULD.

1363
00:37:50,967 --> 00:37:51,800
>> WHY?

1364
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,133
I FEEL LIKE IT'S STUPID.

1365
00:37:53,133 --> 00:37:53,800
>> YOU'RE MAD.

1366
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:54,733
I CAN TELL ON YOUR FACE BECAUSE

1367
00:37:54,733 --> 00:37:55,533
YOU WON'T LOOK AT ME WHILE

1368
00:37:55,533 --> 00:37:56,167
YOU'RE TALKING.

1369
00:37:56,167 --> 00:37:57,067
>> I HAVEN'T LOOKED AT YOU THE

1370
00:37:57,067 --> 00:37:57,733
WHOLE TIME.

1371
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:58,500
>> AND YOU GOT THAT LITTLE,

1372
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,100
LIKE, SMARTASS LOOK ON YOUR

1373
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,600
FACE.

1374
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:04,067
>> COME ON, DON'T USE HIM AS A

1375
00:38:04,067 --> 00:38:05,067
DISTRACTION.

1376
00:38:05,067 --> 00:38:05,933
EVERY TIME I TRY TO TELL YOU

1377
00:38:05,933 --> 00:38:06,867
SOMETHING, YOU JUST GIVE ME ONE

1378
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,867
WORD ANSWERS.

1379
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,333
I'M PAYING ATTENTION TO HIM.

1380
00:38:14,333 --> 00:38:15,433
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO,

1381
00:38:15,433 --> 00:38:16,300
ISN'T IT?

1382
00:38:16,300 --> 00:38:17,333
>> I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO ACTUALLY

1383
00:38:17,333 --> 00:38:18,600
HAVE A TALK WITH ME FOR ONCE.

1384
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,300
IT'S WHAT RELATIONSHIPS DO WHEN

1385
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:21,067
THEY'RE FAMILIES.

1386
00:38:21,067 --> 00:38:22,467
THEY DON'T JUST ACT LIKE YOU'RE

1387
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:23,400
ACTING.

1388
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,067
>> LIKE WHAT?

1389
00:38:24,067 --> 00:38:24,833
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO SAY?

1390
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:25,667
I AIN'T GOT NOTHING TO SAY.

1391
00:38:25,667 --> 00:38:26,667
>> I JUST WANT TO, LIKE...

1392
00:38:26,667 --> 00:38:27,467
>> I WANT TO PLAY WITH HIM.

1393
00:38:27,467 --> 00:38:28,100
>> BLOW IT UP.

1394
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,200
THAT'S ALL YOU WANT TO DO

1395
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,133
WHEN I'M TRYING TO TALK TO YOU.

1396
00:38:30,133 --> 00:38:31,067
ANY OTHER TIME, YOU DON'T WANT

1397
00:38:31,067 --> 00:38:32,500
TO PLAY WITH HIM.

1398
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,400
SO ARE YOU GONNA TELL ME HOW YOU

1399
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,133
ACTUALLY FEEL?

1400
00:38:35,133 --> 00:38:36,300
>> YOU'RE ANNOYING.

1401
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:36,967
>> I'M ANNOYING?

1402
00:38:36,967 --> 00:38:37,667
>> MM-HMM.

1403
00:38:37,667 --> 00:38:38,600
>> SCREW YOU.

1404
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,400
>> [laughs]

1405
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,300
>> SEE, THAT'S HOW YOUR AN

1406
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,933
ASS[bleep] RIGHT THERE.

1407
00:38:42,933 --> 00:38:44,900
>> [chuckles]

1408
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,200
>> YOU KNOW, LIKE, HONESTLY, YOU

1409
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,367
JUST PISSED ME OFF WITH THAT.

1410
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,267
>> * HOME

1411
00:38:59,267 --> 00:39:02,533
* HOME ALL ALONE

1412
00:39:02,533 --> 00:39:05,733
* LYING IN MY BED

1413
00:39:05,733 --> 00:39:08,900
* HIDING IN MY HEAD

1414
00:39:11,067 --> 00:39:12,200
>> WHEN I FIRST MET DUSTIN,

1415
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:13,400
I LIKED HIM BECAUSE HE WAS

1416
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,467
FUNNY, RECKLESS, CAREFREE, AND

1417
00:39:15,467 --> 00:39:17,267
WE HAD FUN AND PARTIED TOGETHER.

1418
00:39:17,267 --> 00:39:18,467
AND THEN WHEN I GOT PREGNANT,

1419
00:39:18,467 --> 00:39:19,700
EVERYTHING CHANGED.

1420
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,833
DUSTIN'S STILL THE CAREFREE

1421
00:39:20,833 --> 00:39:22,233
PERSON, BUT I LEARNED THAT

1422
00:39:22,233 --> 00:39:24,267
I HAVE TO BE A FULL-TIME MOMMY.

1423
00:39:24,267 --> 00:39:25,600
A YEAR AGO I NEVER THOUGHT I'D

1424
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,433
HAVE A BABY AT 16 AND BE IN A

1425
00:39:27,433 --> 00:39:29,600
COURTROOM AT 17 FILING FOR CHILD

1426
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,933
SUPPORT ON MY BOYFRIEND BECAUSE

1427
00:39:31,933 --> 00:39:33,067
HE DOESN'T HELP.

1428
00:39:33,067 --> 00:39:34,633
MAMA.

1429
00:39:34,633 --> 00:39:36,467
MAMA.

1430
00:39:36,467 --> 00:39:37,900
I NEVER THOUGHT THAT I'D BE

1431
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,567
STRONG ENOUGH TO GO AND DO CHILD

1432
00:39:39,567 --> 00:39:42,233
SUPPORT, BUT I GOT WORRY ABOUT

1433
00:39:42,233 --> 00:39:44,400
MY SON AND WHAT HE NEEDS

1434
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,567
AND WHAT'S BEST FOR HIM.

1435
00:39:45,567 --> 00:39:46,967
>> WELCOME TO KASEY'S.

1436
00:39:46,967 --> 00:39:47,633
>> HI.

1437
00:39:47,633 --> 00:39:49,333
>> ALL RIGHT, WE HAVE YOU A JOB

1438
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:50,333
APPLICATION.

1439
00:39:50,333 --> 00:39:51,067
>> OKAY.

1440
00:39:51,067 --> 00:39:51,800
>> SO YOU COULD WORK DAYS OR

1441
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:52,467
NIGHTS.

1442
00:39:52,467 --> 00:39:53,133
>> UH-HUH.

1443
00:39:53,133 --> 00:39:54,067
>> ALL RIGHT, WELL, THAT SOUNDS

1444
00:39:54,067 --> 00:39:54,667
AWESOME.

1445
00:39:54,667 --> 00:39:56,167
>> IN THE BEGINNING, I WAS THE

1446
00:39:56,167 --> 00:39:57,067
ONLY ONE THAT HAD HOPE FOR

1447
00:39:57,067 --> 00:39:58,767
DUSTIN, AND EVERY DAY THE FAITH

1448
00:39:58,767 --> 00:40:00,967
GOES AWAY MORE.

1449
00:40:00,967 --> 00:40:02,333
I DON'T REALLY SEE ME AND DUSTIN

1450
00:40:02,333 --> 00:40:03,433
TOGETHER FOREVER.

1451
00:40:03,433 --> 00:40:04,733
WE'RE HONESTLY TWO DIFFERENT

1452
00:40:04,733 --> 00:40:09,300
PEOPLE NOW.

1453
00:40:09,300 --> 00:40:10,733
[sighs]

1454
00:40:10,733 --> 00:40:12,400
MY OPINION, YOU SHOULD WAIT TO

1455
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,067
HAVE A BABY BECAUSE YOUR LIFE IS

1456
00:40:14,067 --> 00:40:15,467
NOT WHAT YOU'RE GONNA THINK.

1457
00:40:15,467 --> 00:40:16,433
YOU'RE GONNA THINK YOU'RE GONNA

1458
00:40:16,433 --> 00:40:18,533
HAVE A FAMILY AND THE MONEY IN

1459
00:40:18,533 --> 00:40:20,233
THE HOUSE, AND YOU'RE NOT.

1460
00:40:20,233 --> 00:40:21,100
YOU'RE GONNA BE STUCK AT HOME

1461
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,433
WITH YOUR MOM OR YOUR DAD FOR

1462
00:40:22,433 --> 00:40:25,033
YEARS, AND MOST LIKELY, HATE TO

1463
00:40:25,033 --> 00:40:25,900
BREAK IT TO EVERYBODY, YOU'RE

1464
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,100
NOT GONNA BE WITH THE PERSON

1465
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:29,100
YOU HAVE A BABY WITH.

1466
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:46,533
>> announcer: ON THE NEXT

1467
00:40:46,533 --> 00:40:47,467
 16 AND PREGNANT... 

1468
00:40:47,467 --> 00:40:48,767
>> WITH MY MOM BEING IN JAIL,

1469
00:40:48,767 --> 00:40:50,000
IT'S REALLY HARD FOR ME TO

1470
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:50,933
FOCUS.

1471
00:40:50,933 --> 00:40:52,267
>> I THINK HE'S BETTER OFF HERE.

1472
00:40:52,267 --> 00:40:53,600
>> WITH TREVOR'S MOM, I DON'T

1473
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:54,967
FEEL COMFORTABLE SAYING,

1474
00:40:54,967 --> 00:40:55,967
"HERE'S MY KID.

1475
00:40:55,967 --> 00:40:57,067
YOU CAN BE ALONE WITH HIM."

1476
00:40:57,067 --> 00:40:58,667
I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU'RE A BAD

1477
00:40:58,667 --> 00:40:59,400
MOM, TINA.

1478
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,267
>> THERE'S NOBODY IN THIS WORLD

1479
00:41:01,267 --> 00:41:02,233
THAT WOULDN'T TRUST ME WITH

1480
00:41:02,233 --> 00:41:02,900
THEIR [bleep] BABY!

1481
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:04,900
>> I TRIED TO TALK TO YOU.
