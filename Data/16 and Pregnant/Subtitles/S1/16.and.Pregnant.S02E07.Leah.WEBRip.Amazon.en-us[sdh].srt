>> HEY, MY NAME IS LEAH.

00:00:05,706 --> 00:00:07,075
I'M 17 YEARS OLD,

00:00:07,075 --> 00:00:08,042
AND I LIVE IN THE MOUNTAINS

00:00:08,042 --> 00:00:09,043
OF WEST VIRGINIA

5
00:00:09,043 --> 00:00:11,379
IN A SMALL TOWN CALLED ELKVIEW.

6
00:00:11,379 --> 00:00:13,013
MY HOUSE IS PRETTY CROWDED.

7
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:14,448
THERE'S MY BROTHER, SISTER,

8
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:15,749
AND MY MOM.

9
00:00:15,749 --> 00:00:17,085
MY DAD LEFT WHEN I WAS LITTLE,

10
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:18,486
SO I REALLY DON'T KNOW HIM.

11
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:20,654
ME AND MY MOM ARE REALLY CLOSE.

12
00:00:20,654 --> 00:00:22,090
SHE SPOILS ME ROTTEN,

13
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:25,393
'CAUSE I'M HER FIRSTBORN.

14
00:00:25,393 --> 00:00:26,394
THAT'S REGAN.

15
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:27,695
THAT'S RACHAEL.

16
00:00:27,695 --> 00:00:28,796
THAT'S ME.

17
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:29,463
AND THAT'S ALYSSA.

18
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:31,099
WE'RE PRETTY MUCH INSEPARABLE.

19
00:00:31,099 --> 00:00:32,166
WE'RE ALL ON THE CHEERLEADING

20
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:34,402

THIS IS COREY.

25
00:00:39,673 --> 00:00:40,441
HE DROVE ME HOME FROM A PARTY

26
00:00:40,441 --> 00:00:42,343
ONE NIGHT, AND ONE THING LED

27
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:43,043
TO ANOTHER.

28
00:00:43,043 --> 00:00:45,513
COREY'S TWO YEARS OLDER THAN ME,

29
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:47,348
BUT I'M DEFINITELY MORE MATURE.

30
00:00:47,348 --> 00:00:48,149
ARE YOU GONNA?

31
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:49,850
WHY DON'T YOU LISTEN TO ME?

32
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:50,784
WE JUST STARTED DATING,

33
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:51,652
AND WE'RE STILL GETTING TO KNOW

34
00:00:51,652 --> 00:00:52,720
EACH OTHER.

35
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,821
I DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE

36
00:00:53,821 --> 00:00:54,655
IT, BUT WE'RE TRYING TO STAY

37
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:55,323
TOGETHER AND WORK IT OUT

38
00:00:55,323 --> 00:00:56,724
BECAUSE...

39
00:00:56,724 --> 00:00:57,625
LIGHT IT.

40
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:58,326
>> I LIT IT.

41
00:00:58,326 --> 00:00:59,660
IT'S LIGHTED.

42
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,428
[laughter]

43
00:01:00,428 --> 00:01:01,095
>> IT'S LIGHTED.

00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:03,731
>> I'M PREGNANT...

45
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:04,398
[chime dings]

46
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,400
WITH TWINS.

47
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:17,445
ME AND COREY'S RELATIONSHIP

48
00:01:17,445 --> 00:01:19,647
GOT SET ON THE FAST TRACK.

49
00:01:19,647 --> 00:01:21,215
THAT'S FOR SURE.

50
00:01:21,215 --> 00:01:22,616
COREY WAS JUST SUPPOSED TO BE

51
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:24,218
A REBOUND FOR ME, 'CAUSE WHEN

52
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:25,619
WE MET, I'D JUST GOT OUT OF

53
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:27,688
A THREE-YEAR-LONG RELATIONSHIP.

54
00:01:27,688 --> 00:01:29,190
AT FIRST, THINGS WERE GREAT,

55
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:30,658
AND WE HAD FUN.

56
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:32,660
OH, MY GOD, COREY.

57
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,394
>> I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

58
00:01:33,394 --> 00:01:34,228
>> BUT WE WERE ONLY DATING

59
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:37,698
ONE MONTH BEFORE I GOT PREGNANT.

60
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:38,966
IT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE,

61
00:01:38,966 --> 00:01:39,767
'CAUSE WE HARDLY EVEN KNOW

62
00:01:39,767 --> 00:01:41,402
EACH OTHER, AND NOW WE'RE

63
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:42,303
HAVING TWINS.

64
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:43,237
>> MOST OF THE TIME,

65
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:45,539
YOU THINK, "OH, IF I GET

66
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:46,607
PREGNANT, I'LL HAVE A KID,

67
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:47,641
AND THAT'LL BE ALL RIGHT."

68
00:01:47,641 --> 00:01:48,309
YOU NEVER THINK,

69
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:49,543
IF I HAVE TWO KIDS...

70
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:50,244
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

71
00:01:50,244 --> 00:01:51,312
>> AND TWO KIDS IS GONNA BE

72
00:01:51,312 --> 00:01:53,447
TWICE THE EXPENSE.

73
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:54,782
SO I FLIP OUT ABOUT THAT.

74
00:01:54,782 --> 00:01:55,549
>> TWICE THE AMOUNT OF DIAPERS.

75
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:56,950
TWICE THE AMOUNT...

76
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,219
>> TWICE THE EVERYTHING.

77
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:00,954
>> EVERYTHING.

78
00:02:00,954 --> 00:02:02,490
>> GONNA BE ROUGH.

79
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:04,992
ALL BECAUSE ONE FUN NIGHT

80
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:06,594
IN MY TRUCK.

81
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:07,428
>> IT WAS SAD, THOUGH.

82
00:02:07,428 --> 00:02:08,296
>> IT'S YOUR FAULT.

83
00:02:08,296 --> 00:02:10,264
>> COREY, SHUT UP, REALLY.

84
00:02:10,264 --> 00:02:12,233
YOU SHUT UP.

85
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:14,902
[laughter]

86
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:15,903
YOU SAID, "OH, IT NEVER

87
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:16,604
HAPPENED BEFORE."

88
00:02:16,604 --> 00:02:17,605
>> OKAY, NO, BECAUSE

89
00:02:17,605 --> 00:02:19,273
IT DOESN'T--IT'S NEVER

90
00:02:19,273 --> 00:02:20,308
AFFECTED IT BEFORE.

91
00:02:20,308 --> 00:02:21,309
YOU KNOW, IF YOU MISS IT,

92
00:02:21,309 --> 00:02:23,444
AFTER A MONTH OR SO,

93
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:24,712
IT'S FINE TO, LIKE--

94
00:02:24,712 --> 00:02:25,579
>> BUT YOU AIN'T NEVER BEEN

95
00:02:25,579 --> 00:02:26,113
WITH A MAN BEFORE.

96
00:02:26,113 --> 00:02:27,281
[chuckles]

97
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:28,382
>> OH, YEAH.

98
00:02:28,382 --> 00:02:29,583
OKAY.

99
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,752
YOU'RE SOME KIND OF MAN HERE.

100
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:32,920
>> I THINK WE'RE GETTING

101
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,623
USED TO IT, TO EVERYTHING.

102
00:02:35,623 --> 00:02:36,624
>> NO, I THINK WE'RE JUST

103
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:37,625
GETTING USED TO EACH OTHER.

104
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:38,826
FOR GOD SAKES, IT WAS WHAT?

105
00:02:38,826 --> 00:02:39,660
A MONTH, AND WE WERE

106
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,961
BEING PREGNANT.

107
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:41,762
IT'S KIND OF FUNNY, THOUGH,

108
00:02:41,762 --> 00:02:48,001
THAT, LIKE, I'M THE FIRST,

109
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:48,669
LIKE, REAL RELATIONSHIP

110
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,504
THAT YOU HAD.

111
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,339
>> YEAH.

112
00:02:51,339 --> 00:02:53,707
>> AND WE'RE PREGNANT.

113
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:55,376
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

114
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:57,044
>> MUST BE KIND OF HARD.

115
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:58,546
>> IT IS.

116
00:02:58,546 --> 00:03:00,381
WASN'T READY FOR THAT YET,

117
00:03:00,381 --> 00:03:02,015
DEFINITELY.

118
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:02,750
>> IT'S HARD FOR ME TOO,

119
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:06,387
BECAUSE I WAS USED TO, LIKE...

120
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:08,121
YOU KNOW, DON'T GET MAD

121
00:03:08,121 --> 00:03:09,857
IF I SAY THIS, BUT, LIKE,

122
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,892
KNOWING SOMEBODY REALLY WELL.

123
00:03:11,892 --> 00:03:13,060
BEING WITH SOMEBODY FOR TWO

124
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,428
YEARS AND NOT GETTING PREGNANT

125
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:15,128
AND THEN BEING WITH SOMEBODY

126
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:19,433
FOR A MONTH AND BEING PREGNANT.

127
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:20,834
WHILE I WAS WITH MY EX-BOYFRIEND

128
00:03:20,834 --> 00:03:21,602
ROBBIE, I WAS ON BIRTH CONTROL

129
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:24,037
THE WHOLE TIME.

130
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:24,805
BUT WHEN WE BROKE UP,

131
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:26,574
I MISSED ONE OF MY SHOTS.

132
00:03:26,574 --> 00:03:29,142
TURNS OUT, YOU REALLY

133
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:29,977
CAN'T DO THAT.

134
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:32,012
SO NOW I'M PREGNANT.

135
00:03:32,012 --> 00:03:32,746
WE FOUND OUT WE'RE HAVING

136
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:33,581
TWO GIRLS.

137
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:35,749
THEY'RE FRATERNAL TWINS,

138
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:36,984
AND WE'RE NAMING THEM

139
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:38,552
ALIANNAH AND ALEEAH.

140
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:39,553
THERE'S NOT ROOM FOR ALL OF US

141
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:42,189
AT MY MOM'S HOUSE, SO BEFORE THE

142
00:03:42,189 --> 00:03:43,891
GIRLS ARE BORN, ME AND COREY

143
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,726
HAVE TO MOVE IN TOGETHER.

144
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:47,661
IT'S A LOT TO GET USED TO,

145
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:48,829
NOT JUST FOR US BUT FOR

146
00:03:48,829 --> 00:03:50,531
OUR FAMILIES TOO.

147
00:03:50,531 --> 00:03:51,499
MAMA WAS STARTING TO GET

148
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:52,900
MORE EXCITED ABOUT THE WHOLE

149
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,134
BABY THING.

150
00:03:54,134 --> 00:03:55,636
>> I COULD TELL DAD, HE WAS

151
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:56,504
READY TO BEAT MY HEAD OFF WHEN

152
00:03:56,504 --> 00:03:57,505
I TOLD HIM YOU WAS PREGNANT.

153
00:03:57,505 --> 00:03:58,972
HE SAT THERE.

154
00:03:58,972 --> 00:03:59,640
HE WAS LIKE...

155
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:01,208
[huffing]

156
00:04:01,208 --> 00:04:02,543
FOR, LIKE, A MINUTE.

157
00:04:02,543 --> 00:04:03,277
>> WHEN OUR PARENTS FOUND OUT

158
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:04,878
I WAS PREGNANT, THEY WERE

159
00:04:04,878 --> 00:04:06,747
REALLY DISAPPOINTED,

160
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:08,115
BUT REALITY HAS SETTLED IN,

161
00:04:08,115 --> 00:04:08,949
AND THEY'RE TRYING TO BE

162
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:09,917
SUPPORTIVE.

163
00:04:09,917 --> 00:04:10,751
>> IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU COME OUT.

164
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,653
>> WHERE DO Y'ALL WANT TO SIT?

165
00:04:12,653 --> 00:04:15,055
>> YEAH, GO AHEAD, JOETTA.

166
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:16,624
>> THEY'RE LIKE, "OH, MY GOD.

167
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:18,091
OH, MY GOD."

168
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,059
AND I'M LAYING HERE LIKE,

169
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:19,960
"WHAT'S GOING ON?"

170
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:20,761
YOU KNOW, TELL--

171
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:21,629
YOU KNOW, THEY KIND OF SCARED ME

172
00:04:21,629 --> 00:04:22,296
'CAUSE I THOUGHT SOMETHING

173
00:04:22,296 --> 00:04:23,564
WAS GOING ON.

174
00:04:23,564 --> 00:04:24,131
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,

175
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:25,198
THE WOMAN LOOKS AT ME,

176
00:04:25,198 --> 00:04:25,999
AND SHE'S LIKE, "HONEY,

177
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,034
YOU'RE HAVING TWINS."

178
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:28,702
I WAS LIKE, "OH, MY GOD."

179
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:29,837
>> SHE SAID, "I HATE TO BE

180
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:31,171
THE BARRIER OF THIS NEWS,

181
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:32,706
AND YOU ONLY 17."

182
00:04:32,706 --> 00:04:33,341
>> I WAS FLIPPING OUT.

183
00:04:33,341 --> 00:04:34,342
I SAID, "OH, MY GOD."

184
00:04:34,342 --> 00:04:35,175
AND I WAS STANDING THERE.

185
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:35,876
MY BOSS WAS LIKE,

186
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:36,377
"WHAT'S WRONG?"

187
00:04:36,377 --> 00:04:38,278
AND I SAID, "I'M HAVING TWINS."

188
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:39,279
MY BOSS PULLS OUT A CHAIR.

189
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,180
AND I'M SITTING THERE SHAKING

190
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,815
LIKE THIS.

191
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:42,750
>> I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK,

192
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,317
REALLY.

193
00:04:43,317 --> 00:04:44,818
I WAS JUST--I WAS...

194
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:45,619
BECAUSE SHE HAS PUT A HOLD

195
00:04:45,619 --> 00:04:47,355
ON EVERYTHING SHE COULD HAVE

196
00:04:47,355 --> 00:04:49,022
DONE IN LIFE, SO...

197
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,358
>> BOTH OF US DID.

198
00:04:50,358 --> 00:04:51,091
>> THIS IS SOME OF THE BEST

199
00:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,727
YEARS OF YOUR LIFE NORMALLY.

200
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:54,428
Y'ALL GOT TO GROW UP QUICK.

201
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:55,763
THAT'S WHAT THE SHAME OF IT IS.

202
00:04:55,763 --> 00:04:56,764
IT'S JUST, YOU GOT TO FORFEIT

203
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:59,800
THOSE YEARS OF DOING WHAT

204
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,735
YOU WANT.

205
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:02,936
I CAN IMAGINE WHAT A CHALLENGE

206
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:03,771
ONE BABY WOULD BE, BUT TWO,

207
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:05,906
I CAN'T IMAGINE.

208
00:05:05,906 --> 00:05:07,240
>> WE'RE SCARED.

209
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,709
I'M SCARED TO DEATH.

210
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:09,377
>> YEAH.

211
00:05:09,377 --> 00:05:10,744
I REALLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE

212
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:11,912
THEM TWO STAY TOGETHER.

213
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:12,413
>> AND MAKE IT.

214
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:13,714
>> YEAH.

215
00:05:13,714 --> 00:05:14,682
>> I HOPE THEY WORK IT--

216
00:05:14,682 --> 00:05:16,183
THINGS OUT FOR THE BEST

217
00:05:16,183 --> 00:05:18,686
OF ALL OF THEM.

218
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:19,086
>> MM-HMM.

219
00:05:19,086 --> 00:05:23,256
THAT'S WHAT WE REALLY WANT.

220
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:27,127
BEING PREGNANT WITH TWINS

221
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:28,762
IS WAY HARDER THAN I THOUGHT

222
00:05:28,762 --> 00:05:30,431
IT WOULD BE.

223
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:32,165
I WAS EXCITED FOR MY SENIOR

224
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:34,034
YEAR, BUT I JUST CAN'T JUGGLE

225
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:35,403
SCHOOLWORK ON TOP OF GETTING

226
00:05:35,403 --> 00:05:36,904
READY FOR THE TWINS, SO I'M

227
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:38,806
TAKING OFF THE FIRST SEMESTER.

228
00:05:38,806 --> 00:05:39,339
NOW I CAN'T BE ON

229
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,808
THE CHEERLEADING TEAM,

230
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:42,776
AND I HARDLY SEE MY FRIENDS.

231
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,111
>> SO WHAT DO YOU MISS MOST

232
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:45,446
ABOUT, LIKE, HIGH SCHOOL

233
00:05:45,446 --> 00:05:46,880
AND THEN, LIKE, BEING ABLE

234
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,915
TO HANG OUT WITH YOUR FRIENDS

235
00:05:47,915 --> 00:05:49,883
AND DO WHATEVER YOU WANT?

236
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:50,851
>> I CHEERED.

237
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:52,052
I CHEERED ALL THE TIME,

238
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:54,555
PEP RALLIES AND GAMES,

239
00:05:54,555 --> 00:05:55,355
AND I DON'T HAVE THAT ANYMORE,

240
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,123
AND IT'S MY SENIOR YEAR,

241
00:05:56,123 --> 00:05:58,091
AND I WANTED IT THE MOST.

242
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,160
SO I KIND OF MISS ALL THAT.

243
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,161
NOW I'M UP IN THE STANDS

244
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:02,329
LIKE THIS.

245
00:06:02,329 --> 00:06:03,330
WHOO.

246
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:04,865
IT'S NOT THE SAME AT ALL.

247
00:06:04,865 --> 00:06:06,500
I MISS IT.

248
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,200
>> ARE YOU COMING BACK

249
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,502
TO HIGH SCHOOL?

250
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:09,837
>> AH, MAYBE THE SECOND

251
00:06:09,837 --> 00:06:10,938
SEMESTER.

252
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:11,939
>> YEAH, AND I HAD TO USE

253
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:13,607
A BREAST PUMP IN THE BATHROOMS

254
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:14,508
AT SCHOOL.

255
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:15,509
>> [squeals]

256
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:16,410
>> WHEN WE FIRST FOUND OUT,

257
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:17,344
IT WAS, LIKE, CRAZY,

258
00:06:17,344 --> 00:06:19,146
'CAUSE LEAH, SHE TOOK, LIKE,

259
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:20,347
16 PREGNANCY TESTS.

260
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,015
[laughter]

261
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:23,283
ALL OF THEM CAME OUT POSITIVE.

262
00:06:23,283 --> 00:06:24,284
SHE'S LIKE, "MAN, I DON'T THINK

263
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:24,852
THIS IS RIGHT.

264
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:25,453
YEAH, IT'S NOT RIGHT."

265
00:06:25,453 --> 00:06:27,287
>> LEAH, ANSWER ME THIS.

266
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:28,622
WHAT'S THE SCARIEST THING

267
00:06:28,622 --> 00:06:30,290
ABOUT BEING PREGNANT RIGHT NOW?

268
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,058
>> YOU KNOW, I REALLY WANT

269
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:31,859
TO TRY TO MAKE IT WORK WITH

270
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:32,560
ME AND COREY.

271
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,495
THAT'S, LIKE, THE BIGGEST THING.

272
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,195
>> IT'S IMPORTANT.

273
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:35,996
>> AND I DIDN'T HAVE MY DAD.

274
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:37,998
YOU KNOW THAT.

275
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:40,000
I DIDN'T HAVE MY DAD AT ALL,

276
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,502
AND I DON'T WANT MY KIDS

277
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:43,036
TO GO WITHOUT THAT AND NOT SEE

278
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:44,004
US TOGETHER.

279
00:06:44,004 --> 00:06:44,572
>> I DON'T SEE THAT.

280
00:06:44,572 --> 00:06:45,539
>> THEY NEED BOTH PARENTS.

281
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:46,907
>> YEAH.

282
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,042
I DON'T WANT MY KIDS TO GROW UP

283
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:50,444
WITHOUT THEIR DAD, SO EVEN

284
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:51,445
THOUGH WE'RE STILL GETTING

285
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:53,080
TO KNOW EACH OTHER, ME AND COREY

286
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:56,917
NEED TO STAY TOGETHER.

287
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,318
I JUST REALLY HOPE ME AND COREY

288
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:00,588
CAN MAKE IT WORK.

289
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:02,055
>> YOU CAN IF Y'ALL WANT TO

290
00:07:02,055 --> 00:07:04,057
AND YOU WORK ON IT HARD ENOUGH.

291
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:06,193
BUT YOU ALL ARE YOUNG AND DON'T

292
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:08,361
KNOW WHAT YOU WANT OUT OF LIFE.

293
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,362
>> I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S REALLY

294
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:10,564
MY SOUL MATE.

295
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:12,065
I MEAN, WE DON'T GET ALONG

296
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:12,533
ALL THE TIME.

297
00:07:12,533 --> 00:07:14,401
WE--OH, GOSH.

298
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:16,336
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

299
00:07:16,336 --> 00:07:17,471
>> WHETHER YOU WANT TO FACE IT

300
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:18,972
OR NOT, YOU TWO HAVE TWO KIDS

301
00:07:18,972 --> 00:07:20,474
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

302
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:21,441
>> BUT WE'VE ONLY BEEN TOGETHER

303
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,442
A MONTH, AND THEN WE GOT

304
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,276
PREGNANT.

305
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,277
AND NOW WE BOTH FEEL LIKE

306
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,046
WE HAVE TO BE TOGETHER.

307
00:07:26,046 --> 00:07:27,380
YOU CAN'T JUST SAY,

308
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,182
"I DON'T WANT TO BE WITH YOU,"

309
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,183
WITH TWO KIDS ON THE WAY.

310
00:07:30,183 --> 00:07:31,018
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

311
00:07:31,018 --> 00:07:31,685
>> RIGHT.

312
00:07:31,685 --> 00:07:32,686
>> YOU CAN'T JUST BE LIKE, NO.

313
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:33,687
>> NOT YOUR AVERAGE BOYFRIEND

314
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:35,723
AND GIRLFRIEND RELATIONSHIP.

315
00:07:35,723 --> 00:07:36,490
>> IT'S NOT THAT EASY TO BE,

316
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,659
LIKE, A SINGLE MOM WITH TWO

317
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:40,360
KIDS.

318
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,729
MOST PEOPLE FALL IN LOVE

319
00:07:41,729 --> 00:07:43,396
AND THEN START A FAMILY.

320
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:44,397
I JUST HOPE IT WORKS OUT

321
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:46,534
THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

322
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,046
>> WHILE MOST OF MY FRIENDS ARE

323
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:01,549
GETTING READY FOR HOMECOMING,

324
00:08:01,549 --> 00:08:02,315
ME AND COREY ARE GETTING READY

325
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,085
TO START A FAMILY.

326
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:06,353
COREY IS WORKING TWO JOBS

327
00:08:06,353 --> 00:08:07,454
TO SAVE UP MONEY FOR WHEN

328
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:08,088
THE TWINS GET HERE.

329
00:08:08,088 --> 00:08:09,923
AND I'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR

330
00:08:09,923 --> 00:08:10,991
A PLACE FOR US TO LIVE.

331
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:12,926
COREY'S SUPPOSED TO BE SELLING

332
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:14,427
HIS TRUCK, SINCE THERE'S NO ROOM

333
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:16,163
IN THERE FOR TWO BABY SEATS,

334
00:08:16,163 --> 00:08:17,565
BUT SO FAR, HE'S BEEN DRAGGING

335
00:08:17,565 --> 00:08:18,599
HIS FEET.

336
00:08:18,599 --> 00:08:19,399
>> TAKES A LOT OF GROWING UP

337
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:20,200
TO GET RID OF THAT TRUCK.

338
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,468
>> YEAH.

339
00:08:21,468 --> 00:08:22,269
BAD THING ABOUT IT IS, THIS

340
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:23,170
TRUCK'S BEEN BETTER TO ME THAN

341
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,071
LEAH HAS, AND IT'S GOT TO GO.

342
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:26,039
>> OHH.

343
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:27,207
>> BLACK THUNDER MY BABY DOLL.

344
00:08:27,207 --> 00:08:28,075
>> BLACK THUNDER.

345
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:30,210
>> I LOVE MY TRUCK.

346
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,078
>> SO TODAY, I'M DRAGGING COREY

347
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:33,480
TO CHECK OUT A CAR FOR SALE.

348
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,048
I THINK SHE'S KICKING

349
00:08:35,048 --> 00:08:36,717
MY BLADDER,

350
00:08:36,717 --> 00:08:40,087
LIKE, STRAIGHT-UP KICKING IT.

351
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:41,722
>> WE'RE HERE TO LOOK AT

352
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:43,356
THE TAHOE FOR SALE.

353
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,326
[laughter]

354
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:50,197
>> [laughing hysterically]

355
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,198
CAN YOU HOLD ON?

356
00:08:51,198 --> 00:08:52,199
OH, MY GOD.

357
00:08:52,199 --> 00:08:54,668
I JUST PEED MY PANTS.

358
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:56,436
>> YOU CAN LOOK INSIDE OF IT.

359
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:58,505
>> I CAN'T HAUL TWO CAR SEATS

360
00:08:58,505 --> 00:08:59,206
AND LEAH IN THAT TRUCK.

361
00:08:59,206 --> 00:09:00,674
>> CAN'T DO THAT.

362
00:09:00,674 --> 00:09:01,474
>> [laughing]

363
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:02,142
>> GONNA BE ROUGH.

364
00:09:02,142 --> 00:09:03,143
>> OH, MY GOD.

365
00:09:03,143 --> 00:09:06,346
[laughing]

366
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:08,081
I CAN'T--I CAN'T--

367
00:09:08,081 --> 00:09:09,082
PLEASE, GO.

368
00:09:09,082 --> 00:09:11,151
GO, GO.

369
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:12,219
>> YOU GOT TO GET IN.

370
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:14,622
>> [whispering] COREY!

371
00:09:14,622 --> 00:09:17,224
[laughter]

372
00:09:17,224 --> 00:09:19,192
>> SHE PISSED HER PANTS.

373
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,828
SHE--SHE--[laughing]

374
00:09:20,828 --> 00:09:23,496
SHE PEED HER PANTS.

375

00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:29,929
WORSE AND WORSE, AND IT SEEMS

564
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:32,065
LIKE NOTHING THE DOCTORS DO

565
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:33,200
IS HELPING.

566
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,034
>> THEY'VE UPPED IT,

567
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:36,369
AND IT'S NOT--IT'S NOT DOING

568
00:15:36,369 --> 00:15:38,905
ANY GOOD.

569
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:41,041
SHE STARTING TO GET HARDER

570
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:43,943
AND HARDER CONTRACTIONS.

571
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,945
>> YEAH.

572
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:52,952
IT TOOK THREE DAYS IN

573
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,122
THE HOSPITAL, BUT THE DOCTORS

574
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:55,989
FINALLY FOUND A COMBINATION

575
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:59,092
OF MEDICINES THAT WORK FOR ME.

576
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:05,132
SO I MEAN, WITH THE MEDICINE,

577
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:07,367
THEY'VE STOPPED.

578
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:11,571
TODAY, THEY'RE LETTING ME GO

579
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:13,440
HOME, BUT I'M ON STRICT ORDERS

580
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,442
TO STAY ON BED REST FOR THE REST

581
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,644
OF MY PREGNANCY.

582
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:18,345
ANY LITTLE ACTIVITY COULD

583
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:21,114
TRIGGER MY LABOR.

584
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:22,115
DID YOU MISS ME, HUH?

585
00:16:22,115 --> 00:16:22,949
HUH?

586
00:16:22,949 --> 00:16:24,284
DID YOU MISS ME?

587
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:25,285
HUH?

588
00:16:25,285 --> 00:16:26,953
I JUST HOPE THINGS GO SMOOTHLY

589
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:29,489
FROM HERE ON OUT.

590
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:30,057
>> [barks]

591
00:16:30,057 --> 00:16:32,525
>> BED REST SUCKS.

592
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:34,561
ALL I CAN DO IS LIE AROUND.

593
00:16:34,561 --> 00:16:35,595
OOH, AND IT'S REALLY COLD

594
00:16:35,595 --> 00:16:36,663
IN THIS HOUSE.

595
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:38,331
I'M GONNA GO LAY DOWN.

596
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:39,599
I'M BORED AND LONELY,

597
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,000
AND I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT

598
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,001
ALL THE STUFF I SHOULD BE DOING

599
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,137
TO GET READY FOR THE GIRLS.

600
00:16:44,137 --> 00:16:45,772
>> WHAT'S THE WORST THING

601
00:16:45,772 --> 00:16:47,774
YOU HATE ON BED REST?

602
00:16:47,774 --> 00:16:49,342
>> LAYING THERE.

603
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:50,343
THERE'S NOTHING FUN

604
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,611
TO LAYING THERE.

605
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:53,246
I WANT IT OVER WITH.

606
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:54,114
AFTER FOUR WEEKS, I'VE HAD

607
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:57,350
ALL I CAN TAKE.

608
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,221
SINCE I'VE BEEN LAID UP,

609
00:17:01,221 --> 00:17:02,822
MY MOM STEPPED IN AND FOUND ME

610
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:04,191
AND COREY A PLACE TO LIVE.

611
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:06,559
MOVING IN TOGETHER IS A HUGE

612
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,627
STEP FORWARD IN OUR

613
00:17:07,627 --> 00:17:09,229
RELATIONSHIP, AND I DON'T KNOW

614
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:10,163
IF I'M REALLY READY.

615
00:17:10,163 --> 00:17:12,132
BUT READY OR NOT,

616
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:13,800
TODAY IS MOVING DAY.

617
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,534
I'M BREAKING MY BED REST

618
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:16,603
SO ME AND COREY CAN MOVE OVER

619
00:17:16,603 --> 00:17:21,608
SOME OF OUR STUFF.

620
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:22,775
OUR NEW PLACE NEEDS

621
00:17:22,775 --> 00:17:24,344
A LOT OF WORK.

622
00:17:24,344 --> 00:17:25,678
BUT IT'S ALL COREY CAN AFFORD,

623
00:17:25,678 --> 00:17:26,679
SO WE'LL JUST FIX IT UP

624
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:27,780
OURSELVES.

625
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,782
>> THAT'S DARK DARK.

626
00:17:29,782 --> 00:17:30,683
>> YOU DON'T LIKE THAT BROWN?

627
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:31,584
>> NO, I THINK IT'S GONNA LOOK

628
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:32,252
WEIRD ON THE WALLS.

629
00:17:32,252 --> 00:17:34,221
IT'LL LOOK YELLOW.

630
00:17:34,221 --> 00:17:36,523
>> YOU NEED ONE OF THIS ONE?

631
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:37,690
TWO AND THREE?

632
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:38,358
>> AND THEN ONE HERE

633
00:17:38,358 --> 00:17:39,192

634
00:17:39,192 --> 00:17:39,859
>> ONE GALLON?

635
00:17:39,859 --> 00:17:41,494
ALL RIGHT.

636
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:42,829
A SECOND THERE, AND I'LL...

637
00:17:42,829 --> 00:17:44,531

>> IT'S GONNA BE $120 FOR...

639
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:47,867
>> NO, IT AIN'T.

640
00:17:47,867 --> 00:17:49,902
>> 6 TIMES 20.

641
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:52,905
6 GALLONS TIMES $20, $120.

642
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,308
$120 PLUS TAX.

643
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,910
>> OH, GOD.

644
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,911
WHAT IF WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY?

645
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:00,180
UM, COREY, WELL, YOU GO ASK HIM.

646
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,814

00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:12,392
>> AND YOU'RE LOOKING AROUND

653
00:18:12,392 --> 00:18:13,826

00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:34,834
OR AT LEAST, I'M REALLY

751
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:46,713
TRYING TO BE.

752
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:48,981
>> LAST WEEK, ME AND COREY

753
00:20:48,981 --> 00:20:50,483
MOVED IN TOGETHER, AND WE

754
00:20:50,483 --> 00:20:52,819
FINALLY SOLD HIS TRUCK.

755
00:20:52,819 --> 00:20:53,553
WE SPENT TWO WEEKS GETTING

756
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:56,088
SETTLED IN OUR NEW PLACE,

757
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:56,823
AND TODAY, I'M UNPACKING

758
00:20:56,823 --> 00:20:58,625
THE LAST BOXES.

759
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,126
IT'S HARD, THOUGH, 'CAUSE

760
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:01,728
STARTING MY NEW LIFE JUST MAKES

761
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:03,062
ME MISS MY OLD LIFE.

762
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:03,896
>> OH, MAN, THIS IS ALL

763
00:21:03,896 --> 00:21:05,932
YOUR OLD STUFF.

764
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:06,566
"HI, MY NAME IS LEAH.

765
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:08,701
I AM NINE YEARS OLD.

766
00:21:08,701 --> 00:21:09,536
FIVE YEARS FROM NOW,

767
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:11,003
I WILL BE TRYING TO GET

768
00:21:11,003 --> 00:21:13,673
A SCHOLARSHIP TO GO TO COLLEGE."

769
00:21:13,673 --> 00:21:14,741
>> MM.

770
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:16,142
>> THAT CHANGED.

771
00:21:16,142 --> 00:21:16,909
>> SHUT UP.

772
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:17,744
>> "THEN I'M GONNA GET READY

773
00:21:17,744 --> 00:21:19,512
TO GO TO COLLEGE BECAUSE

774
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:20,880
I WANT TO BE A DOCTOR WHEN

775
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:22,081
I GROW UP."

776
00:21:22,081 --> 00:21:22,915
>> "WHAT'S UP WITH YOU

777
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:24,216
AND LITTLE FISHER?"

778
00:21:24,216 --> 00:21:24,984
OH, MY GOD.

779
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:26,986
THAT'S ROBBIE.

780
00:21:26,986 --> 00:21:29,188
"YOU AND LITTLE FISHER."

781
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:30,122
I DATED ROBBIE FOR TWO

782
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,792
FREAKING YEARS.

783
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:33,460
OH, NO--

784
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,160
>> 2 1/2 ALMOST.

785
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,861
>> YEAH, IT WAS ALMOST

786
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:35,695
THREE YEARS.

787
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:36,062
>> YEAH.

788

>> [sighs]

789
00:21:36,563 --> 00:21:39,632
THIS IS SAD.

790
00:21:39,632 --> 00:21:42,635
I WANT TO GO BACK TO THESE DAYS.

791
00:21:42,635 --> 00:21:43,803
I HAVE "I LOVE ROBBIE" WRITTEN

792
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:45,972
ALL OVER THIS FRICKIN' BOOK.

793
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:46,973
>> KINDERGARTEN.

794
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:47,974
>> I REALLY DID LOVE HIM,

795
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:49,642
YOU KNOW?

796
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,578
AND THINGS JUST WENT SO WRONG.

797
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:57,950
[chime dings]

798
00:21:57,950 --> 00:21:58,951
I HAVEN'T TALKED TO ROBBIE

799
00:21:58,951 --> 00:22:00,720
SINCE I GOT PREGNANT, BUT WHEN

800
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,654
I THINK ABOUT HOW HAPPY I WAS

801
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:03,956
WITH HIM, IT MAKES ME QUESTION

802
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:05,625
WHAT I HAVE WITH COREY.

803
00:22:05,625 --> 00:22:07,259
NOW EVERY LITTLE THING COREY

804
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:10,730
DOES DRIVES ME CRAZY.

805
00:22:10,730 --> 00:22:12,198
COREY, DON'T DRIVE SO FAST,

806
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:12,899
PLEASE.

807
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:14,300
>> I AIN'T DRIVING FAST.

808
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,635
I'M GOING 40.

809
00:22:15,635 --> 00:22:16,569
>> YOU'RE HITTING 40.

810
00:22:16,569 --> 00:22:18,905
STOP GETTING ALL DRIVING FAST

811
00:22:18,905 --> 00:22:19,906
AND [bleep].

812
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:21,808
>> GOD, I'M ALWAYS THE BAD GUY.

813
00:22:21,808 --> 00:22:23,009
I'M ALWAYS THE BAD GUY.

814
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:24,176
>> DON'T ACT LIKE THE BAD GUY,

815
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,712
AND YOU WON'T BE THE BAD GUY.

816
00:22:25,712 --> 00:22:26,379
>> WHY ARE YOU GETTING MAD

817
00:22:26,379 --> 00:22:30,049
AT ME FOR?

818
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:30,917
>> IT'S NOT JUST THAT COREY'S

819
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:32,885
DRIVING TOO FAST;

820
00:22:32,885 --> 00:22:34,253
THIS WHOLE RELATIONSHIP

821
00:22:34,253 --> 00:22:37,089
IS GOING TOO FAST.

822
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,791
THE TWINS ARE DUE IN SIX WEEKS,

823
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:40,893
BUT I'M STARTING TO RETHINK

824
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:41,861
EVERYTHING.

825
00:22:41,861 --> 00:22:43,730
THIS IS ALL JUST LIKE

826
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:46,065
AN EMOTIONAL ROLLER COASTER.

827
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:49,402
IT'S, LIKE, A BIG CHANGE,

828
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:51,404
FROM BEING ABLE TO GO AND DO

829
00:22:51,404 --> 00:22:54,240
WHAT I WANT TO DO WITH FRIENDS

830
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:57,910
AND SCHOOL AND CHEERLEADING

831
00:22:57,910 --> 00:23:03,916
AND TO TRYING TO BE A MOM,

832
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:07,253
STAY HOME AND DO THINGS

833
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:08,788
THAT A GROWN WOMAN WOULD DO.

834
00:23:08,788 --> 00:23:10,857
>> YOU MADE DECISIONS THAT'S

835
00:23:10,857 --> 00:23:14,193
PUT YOU IN THAT SITUATION.

836
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:15,762
I'M HAVING TO LET GO

837
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:18,431
OF MY DAUGHTER WAY BEFORE

838
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:22,301
I SHOULD HAVE HAD TO HAVE.

839
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:25,271
>> I DON'T REGRET MY KIDS,

840
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:26,072
BUT I LOSE SLEEP, AND THEY'RE

841
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:29,241
NOT EVEN HERE.

842
00:23:29,241 --> 00:23:31,744
[sighs]

843
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,914
THAT NIGHT, I DECIDED TO STAY

844
00:23:34,914 --> 00:23:37,216
AT MY MOM'S HOUSE BECAUSE

845
00:23:37,216 --> 00:23:40,386
I NEEDED SOME SPACE FROM COREY.

846
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:41,387
WITH SO MUCH ON MY MIND,

847
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:42,822
I COULDN'T SLEEP AT ALL.

848
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:44,256
FINALLY, I WOKE UP MY MOM

849
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:45,558
BECAUSE SOMETHING DIDN'T FEEL

850
00:23:45,558 --> 00:23:46,793
RIGHT.

851
00:23:46,793 --> 00:23:48,961
I THINK I'M LEAKING.

852
00:23:48,961 --> 00:23:50,530
>> YOU THINK WHAT?

853
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:51,864
>> I THINK I'M LEAKING.

854
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:52,532
>> DO YOU WANT ME TO CALL

855
00:23:52,532 --> 00:23:53,933
YOUR DOCTOR?

856
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,568
>> I DON'T KNOW.

857
00:23:55,568 --> 00:23:56,202
I DON'T WANT TO.

858
00:23:56,202 --> 00:23:56,969
'CAUSE IF I GET THERE

859
00:23:56,969 --> 00:23:57,904
AND IT'S PEE, THAT'S GONNA

860
00:23:57,904 --> 00:24:02,609
BE EMBARRASSING.

861
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:03,943
I'M SCARED 'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW

862
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:07,446
WHAT IT IS.

863
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,981
MY MOM TOOK ME TO THE HOSPITAL.

864
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:11,518
TURNS OUT MY WATER FINALLY

865
00:24:11,518 --> 00:24:15,054
BROKE.

866
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:16,288
EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT DUE FOR

867
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,257
SIX MORE WEEKS, THE DOCTOR SAID

868
00:24:18,257 --> 00:24:19,425
IT WAS NORMAL FOR TWINS

869
00:24:19,425 --> 00:24:21,961
TO BE BORN EARLY.

870
00:24:21,961 --> 00:24:22,995
COREY CAME OUT AS SOON

871
00:24:22,995 --> 00:24:24,263
AS I CALLED HIM.

872
00:24:24,263 --> 00:24:25,565
EVEN THOUGH WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING

873
00:24:25,565 --> 00:24:26,298
A LOT, I'M REALLY GLAD

874
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,200
TO SEE HIM.

875
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,068
I HAVE TO HAVE AN EMERGENCY

876
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:31,303
C-SECTION BECAUSE THE BOTTOM

877
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,641
BABY IS BREECHED.

878
00:24:34,641 --> 00:24:35,407
[sighs]

879
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:35,975
>> AW.

[kissing sounds]

881
00:24:37,944 --> 00:24:38,511
>> I LOVE YOU, BABY.

882
00:24:38,511 --> 00:24:40,513
>> I LOVE YOU TOO.

883
00:24:40,513 --> 00:24:42,682
GONNA BE OKAY, PROMISE.

884
00:24:42,682 --> 00:24:44,517
PINKIE PROMISE.

885
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:47,053
>> PROMISE ME.

886
00:24:47,053 --> 00:24:49,556
BETTER BE.

887
00:24:49,556 --> 00:24:51,157
>> THEY PREPPED ME FOR SURGERY,

888
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:52,224
AND COREY PUT ON SCRUBS AND

889
00:24:52,224 --> 00:24:54,594
STAYED WITH ME THE WHOLE TIME.

00:25:11,644 --> 00:25:13,646
ALIANNAH WAS BORN FIRST,

893
00:25:13,646 --> 00:25:15,314
AND ONE MINUTE LATER,

894
00:25:15,314 --> 00:25:18,084
ALEEAH ARRIVED.

895
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:30,162
>> HERE COMES COREY.

896
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:32,464
>> SINCE THE TWINS ARE SIX WEEKS

897
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:34,133
EARLY, THE DOCTORS TOOK THEM

898
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:35,768
STRAIGHT TO INTENSIVE CARE.

899
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:37,570
I WAS STILL IN SURGERY AND

900
00:25:37,570 --> 00:25:41,540
WASN'T EVEN ABLE TO HOLD THEM.

901
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,374
THEY'RE PERFECTLY HEALTHY,

902
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:44,410
BUT THEY WERE SO SMALL;

903
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,712
THEY HAD TO HAVE TUBES

904
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:49,682
TO GIVE THEM FOOD AND OXYGEN.

905
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:51,818
AFTER I RECOVERED FROM SURGERY,

906
00:25:51,818 --> 00:25:52,518
I WENT TO INTENSIVE CARE

907
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:55,454
TO VISIT THEM.

908
00:25:55,454 --> 00:25:58,090
[baby cries]

909
00:26:00,126 --> 00:26:01,794
>> AW.

910
00:26:01,794 --> 00:26:04,263
>> YOU'RE DOING FINE, HONEY.

911
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:15,875
THE TWINS HAVE TO BE CLOSELY

912
00:26:15,875 --> 00:26:16,709
MONITORED, SO THEY'RE STAYING

913
00:26:16,709 --> 00:26:19,211
AT THE HOSPITAL.

914
00:26:19,211 --> 00:26:20,546
I DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE,

915
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:21,280
BUT THREE DAYS AFTER GIVING

916
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,717
BIRTH, I WAS DISCHARGED.

917
00:26:24,717 --> 00:26:26,385
I WASN'T EXPECTING TO LEAVE

918
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:28,888
THE HOSPITAL WITHOUT MY BABIES.

919
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:32,191
I'M REALLY TIRED.

920
00:26:42,201 --> 00:26:46,706
>> BABY.

>> COME HERE.

923
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:51,210
IT'S OKAY.

FOR EIGHT MONTHS, AND NOW

927
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:01,487
I HAVE TO LEAVE THEM.

[sniffs]

929
00:27:04,991 --> 00:27:06,826
THEN I'M WALKING OUT WITH JUST

930
00:27:06,826 --> 00:27:08,494
BALLOONS.

[sniffs]

934
00:27:15,668 --> 00:27:18,304
IT'S HARD.

935
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:29,181
>> THE TWINS HAVE TO STAY IN

936
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:29,816
THE HOSPITAL FOR A WHILE

937
00:27:29,816 --> 00:27:31,450

>> WHAT CAR DO YOU WANT, LEAH?

1304
00:36:38,497 --> 00:36:40,632
>> I DON'T CARE, REALLY.

1305
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:41,467
>> YOU DON'T CARE?

1306
00:36:41,467 --> 00:36:41,800
>> NO.

1307
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,269
>> WHEN DO YOU GET YOUR LICENSE?

1308
00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:44,370
>> SHUT UP, ROBBIE, SHUT UP.

1309
00:36:44,370 --> 00:36:45,437
>> WHEN DO YOU GET YOUR LICENSE?

1310
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:46,238
>> I'VE GOT NOTHING TO SAY

1311
00:36:46,238 --> 00:36:46,605
TO HIM.

1312
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:49,308
THIS WEEK OR NEXT WEEK.

1313
00:36:49,308 --> 00:36:50,242
>> I'M GONNA STAY OFF THE ROAD

1314
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:50,842
NEXT WEEK.

1315
00:36:50,842 --> 00:36:51,377
[laughter]

1316
00:36:51,377 --> 00:36:52,344
>> WHAT ARE YOU DRIVING?

1317
00:36:52,344 --> 00:36:53,845
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1318
00:36:53,845 --> 00:36:54,680
COREY'S GONNA BUY ME A CAR.

1319
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,515
>> COREY'S BUYING YOU A CAR?

1320
00:36:56,515 --> 00:36:58,617
THEN YOU'RE GONNA LEAVE HIM?

1321
00:36:58,617 --> 00:36:59,485
>> RACHAEL.

1322
00:36:59,485 --> 00:37:02,454
[laughter]

1323
00:37:05,791 --> 00:37:07,025
ANYWAYS, YEAH, HE'S GONNA

1324
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:07,859
GET ME A CAR.

1325
00:37:07,859 --> 00:37:08,694
>> WHAT'S HE GETTING YOU?

1326
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:09,395
>> I DON'T KNOW,

1327
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:10,996
WHATEVER I WANT.

1328
00:37:10,996 --> 00:37:12,431
HANGING OUT WITH ROBBIE

1329
00:37:12,431 --> 00:37:14,065
AND ALL MY FRIENDS JUST MAKES ME

1330
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:14,866
REALIZE HOW UNHAPPY I'VE BEEN

1331
00:37:14,866 --> 00:37:15,567
WITH COREY.

1332
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:18,337
MAYBE I SHOULDN'T BE WITH COREY

1333
00:37:18,337 --> 00:37:19,838
IF ALL HE DOES IS BRING ME DOWN.

1334
00:37:19,838 --> 00:37:21,072
COREY SAID, "YOU LOOK TOO GOOD

1335
00:37:21,072 --> 00:37:22,774
NOW TO JUST HAVE TWO KIDS

1336
00:37:22,774 --> 00:37:23,775
TO GO OUT," OR SOMETHING

1337
00:37:23,775 --> 00:37:24,443
LIKE THAT.

1338
00:37:24,443 --> 00:37:25,344
>> YOU GOT TO SHARE IT

1339
00:37:25,344 --> 00:37:25,844
WITH THE WORLD.

1340
00:37:25,844 --> 00:37:26,478
>> I KNOW.

1341
00:37:26,478 --> 00:37:27,212
>> HE SHOULD BE PROUD OF THAT.

1342
00:37:27,212 --> 00:37:28,113
>> YEAH.

1343
00:37:28,113 --> 00:37:29,948
>> YOU'RE A MILF NOW.

1344
00:37:29,948 --> 00:37:31,049
>> YOU'RE A MILF.

1345
00:37:31,049 --> 00:37:32,050
>> I HONESTLY DON'T THINK

1346
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,552
IT'S GONNA WORK, THOUGH.

1347
00:37:33,552 --> 00:37:34,686
>> YOU DON'T THINK SO?

1348
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:35,687
>> WHY?

1349
00:37:35,687 --> 00:37:37,523
>> I'M NOT HAPPY.

1350
00:37:37,523 --> 00:37:38,690
AGAIN, I HATE TO SAY THAT

1351
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:41,026
BECAUSE I'VE, LIKE, MADE MYSELF

1352
00:37:41,026 --> 00:37:42,394
STAY IN THIS POSITION FOR

1353
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:43,529
SO LONG, BUT JUST BECAUSE

1354
00:37:43,529 --> 00:37:45,497
WE HAVE KIDS, I DON'T THINK

1355
00:37:45,497 --> 00:37:46,732
IT'S FAIR THAT I HAVE TO STAY

1356
00:37:46,732 --> 00:37:47,999
WITH HIM.

1357
00:37:47,999 --> 00:37:48,767
>> YOU GUYS WERE TOGETHER

1358
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:49,868
FOR TWO MONTHS, SO...

1359
00:37:49,868 --> 00:37:51,970
>> WE WAS TOGETHER A MONTH.

1360
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:52,538
>> SEE, THAT--

1361
00:37:52,538 --> 00:37:54,172
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO STAY

1362
00:37:54,172 --> 00:37:56,141
TOGETHER.

1363
00:37:57,609 --> 00:37:58,510
>> I'VE ALWAYS SAW CHEMISTRY

1364
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,412
BETWEEN YOU GUYS.

1365
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:01,913
>> SO MAYBE IF YOU GO SO LONG

1366
00:38:01,913 --> 00:38:04,082
AND YOU CAN'T FORGET ABOUT

1367
00:38:04,082 --> 00:38:05,884
SOMEBODY, THEN MAYBE THERE'S

1368
00:38:05,884 --> 00:38:09,955
JUST SOMETHING THERE.

1369
00:38:09,955 --> 00:38:11,590
THE TRUTH IS, THE MORE I SEE

1370
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,725
ROBBIE, THE MORE I MISS HIM.

1371
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:14,893
WHAT IF I ENDED UP WITH

1372
00:38:14,893 --> 00:38:17,028
THE WRONG GUY?

1373
00:38:24,336 --> 00:38:27,305
>> [imitates crying]

1374
00:38:28,774 --> 00:38:30,342
>> EVER SINCE I STARTED GOING

1375
00:38:30,342 --> 00:38:31,677
BACK TO SCHOOL AGAIN, I'VE BEEN

1376
00:38:31,677 --> 00:38:33,479
HANGING OUT WITH ROBBIE A LOT.

1377
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:35,514
THINGS WITH ROBBIE ARE SO EASY.

1378
00:38:35,514 --> 00:38:36,815
IT MAKES ME WONDER IF I MADE

1379
00:38:36,815 --> 00:38:38,083
A BIG MISTAKE BREAKING UP WITH

1380
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:39,084
HIM.

1381
00:38:39,084 --> 00:38:40,586
COREY CAN TELL SOMETHING'S UP

1382
00:38:40,586 --> 00:38:41,887
AND DOESN'T WANT ME GOING OUT

1383
00:38:41,887 --> 00:38:43,054
ANYMORE.

1384
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:46,057
IT'S BECOMING A BIG PROBLEM.

1385
00:38:46,057 --> 00:38:46,892
THERE'S A BASKETBALL GAME

1386
00:38:46,892 --> 00:38:47,659
TONIGHT.

1387
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:48,627
AND IT'S, LIKE, SENIOR NIGHT

1388
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:50,596
FOR BASKETBALL.

1389
00:38:50,596 --> 00:38:51,997
>> MM-HMM.

1390
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:53,532
>> DO YOU CARE IF I GO?

1391
00:38:53,532 --> 00:38:57,469
>> YEAH, WHO'S GONNA BE THERE?

1392
00:38:57,469 --> 00:38:58,236
>> I DON'T HANG AROUND ROBBIE

1393
00:38:58,236 --> 00:38:59,805
AT BASKETBALL GAMES.

1394
00:38:59,805 --> 00:39:01,139
>> YOU DID BEFORE.

1395
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:02,107
YOU UNDERSTAND, IT'S YOUR SENIOR

1396
00:39:02,107 --> 00:39:03,008
YEAR, BUT YOU PUT YOURSELF IN

1397
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:04,209
THIS POSITION.

1398
00:39:04,209 --> 00:39:05,110
SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE

1399
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:05,744
MORE SACRIFICES--

1400
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:06,912
>> YEAH, BUT SACRIFICES DON'T

1401
00:39:06,912 --> 00:39:07,713
MEAN THAT I CAN'T GO TO

1402
00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:08,914
A BASKETBALL GAME.

1403
00:39:08,914 --> 00:39:09,681
>> HOLD ON.

1404
00:39:09,681 --> 00:39:10,281
I GOT A GOOD EXAMPLE.

1405
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:11,049
>> [sighs]

1406
00:39:11,049 --> 00:39:12,217
>> WHAT DID I SACRIFICE

1407
00:39:12,217 --> 00:39:13,952
FOR YOU AND THE GIRLS?

1408
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:14,753
WHAT WAS MY NUMBER ONE PRIDE

1409
00:39:14,753 --> 00:39:15,954
AND JOY THING THAT I OWNED?

1410
00:39:15,954 --> 00:39:16,755
>> OH, A TRUCK.

1411
00:39:16,755 --> 00:39:18,023
>> I LOVED THAT TRUCK.

1412
00:39:18,023 --> 00:39:18,790
OKAY, THAT'S KIND OF LIKE

1413
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:19,625
MY SENIOR YEAR TO ME.

1414
00:39:19,625 --> 00:39:22,093
>> I LOST EVERYTHING TOO.

1415
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,261
I LOST HALF OF MY SENIOR YEAR.

1416
00:39:23,261 --> 00:39:24,596
I LOST HOMECOMING WEEK.

1417
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:26,231
I LOST CHEERING.

1418
00:39:26,231 --> 00:39:27,165
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING

1419
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:28,166
THAT I LOST TOO?

1420
00:39:28,166 --> 00:39:29,100
IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT YOU EITHER.

1421
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:29,968
>> NO, I'M NOT SAYING THAT

1422
00:39:29,968 --> 00:39:30,736
IT'S ALL ABOUT ME.

1423
00:39:30,736 --> 00:39:31,503
>> YOU SHOULD BE CARING ENOUGH

1424
00:39:31,503 --> 00:39:32,270
TO BE LIKE, "LEAH, I STILL FEEL

1425
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,672
LIKE YOU SHOULD GO TO YOUR PROM.

1426
00:39:33,672 --> 00:39:35,006
I STILL FEEL LIKE YOU SHOULD BE

1427
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:36,107
ABLE TO ENJOY YOUR SENIOR NIGHT

1428
00:39:36,107 --> 00:39:36,742
BASKETBALL GAME."

1429
00:39:36,742 --> 00:39:37,676
>> I NEVER SAID YOU COULDN'T GO

1430
00:39:37,676 --> 00:39:39,044
TO YOUR PROM.

1431
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:39,778
I PRETTY MUCH BEND OVER

1432
00:39:39,778 --> 00:39:40,412
BACKWARDS FOR YOU AND DO

1433
00:39:40,412 --> 00:39:41,647
ANYTHING FOR YOU.

1434
00:39:41,647 --> 00:39:43,515
>> DID I SAY THAT YOU DIDN'T?

1435
00:39:43,515 --> 00:39:43,982
>> NO.

1436
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:44,783
>> I'VE NEVER TALKED--

1437
00:39:44,783 --> 00:39:45,517
>> BUT I WISH YOU WOULD HAVE

1438
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:46,284
REALIZED THAT BEFORE YOU LET IT

1439
00:39:46,284 --> 00:39:48,019
GO THIS FAR WITH ROBBIE,

1440
00:39:48,019 --> 00:39:51,056
'CAUSE THIS, THAT, HIM,

1441
00:39:51,056 --> 00:39:53,224
IS THE REASONS FOR US BEING

1442
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:56,061
ON THIS GROUND RIGHT HERE.

1443
00:39:56,061 --> 00:39:56,795
>> I WISH I COULD SAY COREY

1444
00:39:56,795 --> 00:39:58,964
IS WRONG, BUT WHEN I'M WITH

1445
00:39:58,964 --> 00:39:59,831
ROBBIE, THINGS ARE SIMPLE,

1446
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:01,700
AND I HAVE FUN.

1447
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,769
I'M A NORMAL TEENAGER AGAIN.

1448
00:40:03,769 --> 00:40:04,936
[cheers and applause]

1449
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:06,572
>> WAY TO GO, CARTER!

1450
00:40:06,572 --> 00:40:07,272
>> BUT WHEN I'M WITH COREY,

1451
00:40:07,272 --> 00:40:07,939
THERE'S ALL THIS PRESSURE

1452
00:40:07,939 --> 00:40:09,808
TO GIVE UP THE THINGS THAT

1453
00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:11,309
MATTER THE MOST TO ME,

1454
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:14,212
AND EVERY DAY IT GETS WORSE.

1455
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:17,115
>> WE HAVE A FAMILY NOW.

1456
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:17,916
YOU'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL.

1457
00:40:17,916 --> 00:40:18,784
YEAH, THAT'S COOL.

1458
00:40:18,784 --> 00:40:19,851
BUT YOU HAVE TO THINK.

1459
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:23,689
YOU HAVE A FAMILY, OKAY?

1460
00:40:23,689 --> 00:40:24,389
YOU CAN'T GO OUT HERE AND GO

1461
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:25,857
HOG WILD AND DO [bleep] LIKE

1462
00:40:25,857 --> 00:40:28,026
THAT AND SAY THAT YOU DON'T CARE

1463
00:40:28,026 --> 00:40:30,729
WHAT I THINK.

1464
00:40:30,729 --> 00:40:31,863
>> NOT EVERYBODY'S AS INSECURE

1465
00:40:31,863 --> 00:40:33,699
AS YOU.

1466
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:34,432
>> IT AIN'T THAT I'M INSECURE,

1467
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:35,233
LEAH.

1468
00:40:35,233 --> 00:40:35,901
>> YEAH, IT IS.

1469
00:40:35,901 --> 00:40:36,735
>> DO YOU SERIOUSLY THINK THAT

1470
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:37,435
ROBBIE CAN SUPPORT YOU AND

1471
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,037
A FAMILY?

1472
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:40,305
>> DID I SAY HE COULD?

1473
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:41,306
>> NO, BUT THAT'S WHAT'S GONNA

1474
00:40:41,306 --> 00:40:42,273
HAPPEN IF WE SPLIT UP.

1475
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:43,174
YOU'RE GONNA GO CRAWLING RIGHT

1476
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:44,275
BACK TO HIM.

1477
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:45,443
DO I THINK YOU'D PICK HIM

1478
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:46,111
OVER ME?

1479
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:47,846
YEAH, I DO.

1480
00:40:47,846 --> 00:40:49,347
'CAUSE YOU DATED FOR TWO YEARS,

1481
00:40:49,347 --> 00:40:51,316
AND YOU LOVED HIM,

1482
00:40:51,316 --> 00:40:52,150
AND YOU TOLD ME THAT.

1483
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,985
>> JEALOUSY IS WHAT SPLIT US UP.

1484
00:40:53,985 --> 00:40:54,986
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT'S GONNA

1485
00:40:54,986 --> 00:40:56,988
DO, AND YOU'RE LETTING IT.

1486
00:40:56,988 --> 00:40:58,156
>> I WANT TO KNOW WHAT TO DO

1487
00:40:58,156 --> 00:40:59,324
AND HOW WE'RE GONNA FIX IT

1488
00:40:59,324 --> 00:41:00,826
AND IF WE'RE EVEN GONNA FIX IT.

1489
00:41:00,826 --> 00:41:01,392
>> I DON'T EVEN KNOW

1490
00:41:01,392 --> 00:41:03,762
IF IT'S FIXABLE.

1491
00:41:03,762 --> 00:41:04,129
>> WHAT?

1492
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:04,930
>> YOU.

1493
00:41:04,930 --> 00:41:05,997
>> OKAY, WHY?

1494
00:41:05,997 --> 00:41:08,133
>> THE WAY YOU ACT.

1495
00:41:08,133 --> 00:41:09,200
>> WE WAS PERFECTLY FINE

1496
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,736
UNTIL HE WALKED IN THE DOOR.

1497
00:41:10,736 --> 00:41:12,270
>> NO, WE WAS NOT.

1498
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:14,272
YOU'RE CRAZY.

1499
00:41:14,272 --> 00:41:15,841
>> WE WOULD TALK.

1500
00:41:15,841 --> 00:41:17,208
WE HAD FUN.

1501
00:41:17,208 --> 00:41:18,243
BUT WE'RE NOT FUN--

1502
00:41:18,243 --> 00:41:20,311
FUN LIKE GO OUT AND GO TO

1503
00:41:20,311 --> 00:41:21,312
HIBACHI'S AND TO TARGET

1504
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,313
AND WALMART FUN.

1505
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,815
'CAUSE WE HAVE A--

1506
00:41:23,815 --> 00:41:24,983
>> BECAUSE COREY DON'T WANT TO.

1507
00:41:24,983 --> 00:41:25,617
>> DO WE HAVE THE MONEY

1508
00:41:25,617 --> 00:41:27,385
TO DO THAT?

1509
00:41:27,385 --> 00:41:28,453
I WANT TO, LEAH.

1510
00:41:28,453 --> 00:41:29,821
I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY.

1511
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:30,889
WE DON'T HAVE MONEY TO GO OUT

1512
00:41:30,889 --> 00:41:35,927
AND BLOW LIKE [bleep] THAT.

1513
00:41:35,927 --> 00:41:38,229
I DON'T THINK IT IS FIXABLE.

1514
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:41,332
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

1515
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:43,001
'CAUSE WITH YOUR ATTITUDE,

1516
00:41:43,001 --> 00:41:45,170
NOTHING'S GONNA BE FIXABLE.

1517
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:46,504
>> AND WITH YOUR ATTITUDE,

1518
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:49,174
NOTHING'S GONNA BE FIXABLE.

1519
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:51,543
SEEMS LIKE ALL ME AND COREY DO

1520
00:41:51,543 --> 00:41:52,343
IS YELL AT EACH OTHER AND CHANGE

1521
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:55,013
DIRTY DIAPERS.

1522
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,347
GOING TO SCHOOL IS THE ONLY TIME

1523
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:58,984
I CAN JUST RELAX AND HAVE FUN.

1524
00:41:58,984 --> 00:42:00,151
I SEE ALL MY FRIENDS.

1525
00:42:00,151 --> 00:42:00,952
I GO TO BASKETBALL GAMES.

1526
00:42:00,952 --> 00:42:04,089
I'M BACK WHERE I BELONG.

1527
00:42:04,089 --> 00:42:05,256
TODAY, ROBBIE AND HIS FRIEND

1528
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:06,592
DROVE ME TO MY MOM'S HOUSE

1529
00:42:06,592 --> 00:42:07,125
AFTER SCHOOL.

1530
00:42:07,125 --> 00:42:08,059
I INVITED THEM IN TO SEE

1531
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:10,395
THE GIRLS, BUT NOW ROBBIE'S

1532
00:42:10,395 --> 00:42:12,463
BEING SORT OF WEIRD.

1533
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:12,998
WHAT?

1534
00:42:12,998 --> 00:42:15,400
YOU HEAR MOMMY?

1535
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:16,134
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

1536
00:42:16,134 --> 00:42:18,436
>> WE JUST FED HER.

1537
00:42:18,436 --> 00:42:21,039
>> YEAH, WHAT?

1538
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:23,374
[giggles]

1539
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:25,644
WHAT?

1540
00:42:25,644 --> 00:42:27,212
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU GUYS?

1541
00:42:27,212 --> 00:42:29,247
>> NOTHING AT ALL.

1542
00:42:29,247 --> 00:42:31,082
>> MAN, YOU STINK.

1543
00:42:31,082 --> 00:42:33,952
SHE STINKS REALLY BAD.

1544
00:42:33,952 --> 00:42:34,586
>> DOES SHE, REALLY?

1545
00:42:34,586 --> 00:42:37,355
>> YEAH, REALLY BAD.

1546
00:42:37,355 --> 00:42:38,123
>> YOU GUYS WANT TO CHANGE

1547
00:42:38,123 --> 00:42:38,957
HER DIAPER?

1548
00:42:38,957 --> 00:42:39,457
[laughter]

1549
00:42:39,457 --> 00:42:40,659
>> THAT'S FUNNY.

1550
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:41,459
THAT'S YOU RIGHT THERE.

1551
00:42:41,459 --> 00:42:43,028
>> YOU BETTER LEARN HOW NOW.

1552
00:42:43,028 --> 00:42:45,130
>> THAT'S ALL YOU.

1553
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:46,464
IS--

1554
00:42:46,464 --> 00:42:47,232
>> WHAT DID YOU THINK

1555
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:49,000
WHEN I GOT PREGNANT?

1556
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:49,601
>> I THOUGHT YOU MADE

1557
00:42:49,601 --> 00:42:50,235
A DUMB DECISION.

1558
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:54,205
>> YOU SAID I WAS STUPID.

1559
00:42:54,205 --> 00:42:54,606
>> IT WAS.

1560
00:42:54,606 --> 00:42:56,107
>> WELL, IT WASN'T ON PURPOSE.

1561
00:42:56,107 --> 00:42:59,077
>> IT'S USUALLY NOT

1562
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:03,448
WHEN YOU'RE 16.

1563
00:43:03,448 --> 00:43:04,449
>> ROBBIE SEEMS REALLY

1564
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:06,284
UNCOMFORTABLE AROUND THE TWINS.

1565
00:43:06,284 --> 00:43:08,153
MAYBE IT WASN'T SUCH A GOOD IDEA

1566
00:43:08,153 --> 00:43:10,789
INVITING HIM OVER.

1567
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:12,290
THAT NIGHT WHEN COREY FOUND OUT

1568
00:43:12,290 --> 00:43:13,625
ROBBIE CAME TO MY MOM'S HOUSE

1569
00:43:13,625 --> 00:43:15,460
AFTER SCHOOL, HE WAS REALLY

1570
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,695
UPSET.

1571
00:43:16,695 --> 00:43:18,229
>> I DON'T LIKE IT.

1572
00:43:18,229 --> 00:43:19,130
YOU CAN SIT HERE AND SAY

1573
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,699
WHATEVER YOU WANT, BUT YOU

1574
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:22,801
WOULDN'T LIKE THAT EITHER.

1575
00:43:22,801 --> 00:43:23,568
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

1576
00:43:23,568 --> 00:43:25,103
I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT'S

1577
00:43:25,103 --> 00:43:26,772
YOUR FRIENDS, AND HE HANGS OUT

1578
00:43:26,772 --> 00:43:28,139
WITH 'EM, WHATEVER.

1579
00:43:28,139 --> 00:43:30,141
I MEAN, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

1580
00:43:30,141 --> 00:43:32,143
THAT'S COOL.

1581
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:34,379
AND YOU JUST CALL IT STUPID

1582
00:43:34,379 --> 00:43:35,246
AND INSECURE.

1583
00:43:35,246 --> 00:43:37,248
THAT'S YOUR OPINION.

1584
00:43:37,248 --> 00:43:39,384
IF YOU'RE NOT HAPPY, LEAH,

1585
00:43:39,384 --> 00:43:39,818
THAT'S FINE.

1586
00:43:39,818 --> 00:43:41,386
I DON'T WANT YOU MISERABLE.

1587
00:43:41,386 --> 00:43:42,220
>> I THINK WHERE WE'RE--

1588
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:43,221
>> I'M HAPPY IF YOU'RE HAPPY.

1589
00:43:43,221 --> 00:43:43,922
>> I KNOW, BUT I THINK WE'RE

1590
00:43:43,922 --> 00:43:45,857
BOTH MAKING OURSELF UNHAPPY,

1591
00:43:45,857 --> 00:43:46,858
COREY.

1592
00:43:46,858 --> 00:43:47,859
AND I MEAN, IT HURTS,

1593
00:43:47,859 --> 00:43:49,527
BUT WE CAN'T JUST STAY TOGETHER

1594
00:43:49,527 --> 00:43:50,228
JUST BECAUSE OF THE KIDS.

1595
00:43:50,228 --> 00:43:52,530
>> NO, WE CAN'T.

1596
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:53,799
AND I DON'T WANT TO.

1597
00:43:53,799 --> 00:43:54,632
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS BEFORE

1598
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,366
THE KIDS CAME OUT.

1599
00:43:55,366 --> 00:43:57,335
AND IS IT GONNA HURT ME?

1600
00:43:57,335 --> 00:43:59,370
YEAH, IT'S GONNA SUCK.

1601
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:00,238
'CAUSE I ALREADY KNOW THAT.

1602
00:44:00,238 --> 00:44:02,407
I KNOW WE'RE DONE.

1603
00:44:02,407 --> 00:44:07,879
I KNOW THIS, AND YOU KNOW IT.

1604
00:44:07,879 --> 00:44:09,547
WE'RE NOT HAPPY, AND WE FIGHT

1605
00:44:09,547 --> 00:44:11,216
TOO MUCH.

1606
00:44:11,216 --> 00:44:12,283
I LOVE YOU AND MY GIRLS

1607
00:44:12,283 --> 00:44:14,252
SO [bleep] MUCH, LEAH.

1608
00:44:14,252 --> 00:44:16,621
YOU KNOW?

1609
00:44:16,621 --> 00:44:18,423
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE YOU,

1610
00:44:18,423 --> 00:44:19,490
'CAUSE I KNOW IF I LOSE YOU,

1611
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,325
I AIN'T GONNA SEE MY GIRLS

1612
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:20,992
EVERY DAY WHEN I COME HOME

1613
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:21,927
FROM WORK.

1614
00:44:21,927 --> 00:44:23,228
>> YOU WILL, COREY.

1615
00:44:23,228 --> 00:44:23,762
>> NOT WHEN I--

1616
00:44:23,762 --> 00:44:25,196
>> I'M NOT GONNA KEEP THE KIDS

1617
00:44:25,196 --> 00:44:26,331
FROM YOU.

1618
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:27,799
>> NO, IF WE SPLIT UP,

1619
00:44:27,799 --> 00:44:28,767
I MEAN, LET'S SAY WE SPLIT UP

1620
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:29,434
RIGHT NOW.

1621
00:44:29,434 --> 00:44:30,535
IF YOU CAME TO ME TOMORROW

1622
00:44:30,535 --> 00:44:32,303
AND ASKED IF I'D TAKE YOU BACK,

1623
00:44:32,303 --> 00:44:33,338
LEAH, I WOULD.

1624
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:35,807
[sniffs]

1625
00:44:35,807 --> 00:44:38,877
I LOVE YOU SO [bleep] MUCH.

1626
00:44:41,813 --> 00:44:43,481
>> LIKE, I LAY IN BED AT NIGHT,

1627
00:44:43,481 --> 00:44:44,482
AND MOST OF THE TIME,

1628
00:44:44,482 --> 00:44:46,317
I JUST WANT TO CRY BECAUSE

1629
00:44:46,317 --> 00:44:48,353
I'M SO UNHAPPY WITH THE WAY

1630
00:44:48,353 --> 00:44:50,021
WE FIGHT, THE WAY WE ARGUE.

1631
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:51,022
IT'S--

1632
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:51,757
>> I DON'T WANT NOBODY

1633
00:44:51,757 --> 00:44:53,691
EXCEPT FOR YOU.

1634
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:54,860
AND NOT BEING ABLE TO COME HOME

1635
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:57,863
AND GIVE YOU A KISS AND A HUG

1636
00:44:57,863 --> 00:44:58,596
OR SLEEP WITH YOU OR CUDDLE

1637
00:44:58,596 --> 00:45:01,366
WITH YOU, YOU KNOW?

1638
00:45:09,274 --> 00:45:09,975
BUT IT'S WHATEVER YOU WANT,

1639
00:45:09,975 --> 00:45:12,878
LEAH.

1640
00:45:29,828 --> 00:45:31,296
>> ME AND COREY JUST GOT IN

1641
00:45:31,296 --> 00:45:33,865
A HUGE FIGHT.

1642
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:36,902
>> WE JUST KIND OF ARGUED

1643
00:45:36,902 --> 00:45:37,769
ABOUT--HE DOESN'T WANT ME TO

1644
00:45:37,769 --> 00:45:39,270
HANG OUT WITH ROBBIE AT ALL,

1645
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:41,606
REALLY.

1646
00:45:41,606 --> 00:45:43,308
AND, LIKE, COREY TOLD ME, LIKE,

1647
00:45:43,308 --> 00:45:45,310
TONIGHT THAT I COULD JUST, LIKE,

1648
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:48,346
TELL HIM THE TRUTH ABOUT HOW

1649
00:45:48,346 --> 00:45:52,350
I FEEL, BUT IT'S SO HARD,

1650
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:53,684
BECAUSE I DON'T--

1651
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:54,685
I MEAN, I DON'T WANT TO HURT

1652
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:56,354
HIM, AND I DON'T WANT THE GUILT

1653
00:45:56,354 --> 00:45:57,488
TO COME BACK ON ME.

1654
00:45:57,488 --> 00:46:00,625
AFTER OUR ARGUMENT, ME AND COREY

1655
00:46:00,625 --> 00:46:02,327
NEED A BREAK FROM EACH OTHER.

1656
00:46:02,327 --> 00:46:03,829
SO I'M STAYING AT MY MOM'S HOUSE

1657
00:46:03,829 --> 00:46:05,997
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

1658
00:46:05,997 --> 00:46:07,298
[chime dings]

1659
00:46:07,298 --> 00:46:08,766
AT SCHOOL TODAY, I TRIED TO TALK

1660
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:10,301
TO ROBBIE ABOUT EVERYTHING,

1661
00:46:10,301 --> 00:46:12,503
BUT HE AVOIDED ME ALL AFTERNOON.

1662
00:46:12,503 --> 00:46:13,738
I THOUGHT HE WOULD BE HAPPY

1663
00:46:13,738 --> 00:46:14,806
TO HEAR I'M ENDING THINGS WITH

1664
00:46:14,806 --> 00:46:16,875
COREY, BUT NOW I'M NOT SURE

1665
00:46:16,875 --> 00:46:20,378
I KNOW WHAT ROBBIE WANTS EITHER.

1666
00:46:20,378 --> 00:46:21,880
AFTER SCHOOL, I SAT DOWN WITH

1667
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,048
MY MOM TO TRY TO FIGURE

1668
00:46:23,048 --> 00:46:24,582
EVERYTHING OUT.

1669
00:46:24,582 --> 00:46:25,917
SO ABOUT THE ROBBIE AND COREY

1670
00:46:25,917 --> 00:46:27,085
THING, I MEAN, I WAS WITH ROBBIE

1671
00:46:27,085 --> 00:46:28,586
FOR THREE YEARS, AND I LOVED HIM

1672
00:46:28,586 --> 00:46:30,688
AND THEN JUMPED INTO THINGS WITH

1673
00:46:30,688 --> 00:46:32,523
COREY AND GOT PREGNANT.

1674
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:34,359
LIKE, ME AND ROBBIE HADN'T EVEN

1675
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:35,360
BEEN APART THAT LONG.

1676
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:36,661
>> COREY WAS A REBOUND FROM

1677
00:46:36,661 --> 00:46:38,063
BREAKING UP WITH ROBBIE.

1678
00:46:38,063 --> 00:46:39,464
>> MM-HMM.

1679
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:40,398
>> AND THEN YOU ENDED UP

1680
00:46:40,398 --> 00:46:40,899
PREGNANT.

1681
00:46:40,899 --> 00:46:42,033
YOU WEREN'T OVER THE BOY.

1682
00:46:42,033 --> 00:46:42,767
>> IT WAS LIKE I WAS

1683
00:46:42,767 --> 00:46:43,768
IN THE MIDDLE OF TWO GUYS,

1684
00:46:43,768 --> 00:46:45,070
LIKE, ONE GUY I LOVED,

1685
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:47,805
AND ONE GUY I HAD KIDS WITH.

1686
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,440
SO I MEAN, I LOVED COREY,

1687
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:51,476
BUT IT WASN'T THE SAME KIND

1688
00:46:51,476 --> 00:46:52,878
OF LOVE, I GUESS.

1689
00:46:52,878 --> 00:46:55,947
COREY AND I, WE ALWAYS FOUGHT.

1690
00:46:55,947 --> 00:46:58,116
LIKE, WE FOUGHT ALL THE TIME.

1691
00:46:58,116 --> 00:46:58,884
>> IF THERE WASN'T KIDS,

1692
00:46:58,884 --> 00:47:00,618
YOU AND COREY BOTH HAVE SAID

1693
00:47:00,618 --> 00:47:01,786
Y'ALL WOULDN'T BE TOGETHER.

1694
00:47:01,786 --> 00:47:03,154
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

1695
00:47:03,154 --> 00:47:04,822
>> IF YOU DON'T LOVE COREY,

1696
00:47:04,822 --> 00:47:06,057
YOU BETTER MAKE UP YOUR MIND,

1697
00:47:06,057 --> 00:47:06,791
BECAUSE IF YOU STAY WITH THAT

1698
00:47:06,791 --> 00:47:08,994
PERSON AND YOU DON'T LOVE THEM,

1699
00:47:08,994 --> 00:47:10,561
SIX MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD,

1700
00:47:10,561 --> 00:47:11,662
YOU'RE GONNA BE IN THE SAME

1701
00:47:11,662 --> 00:47:14,499
SITUATION THAT YOU'RE IN NOW.

1702
00:47:14,499 --> 00:47:17,869
>> I KNOW.

1703
00:47:17,869 --> 00:47:19,204
IT'S BEEN THREE DAYS,

1704
00:47:19,204 --> 00:47:20,538
AND ME AND COREY HAVEN'T SEEN

1705
00:47:20,538 --> 00:47:22,707
EACH OTHER AT ALL.

1706
00:47:22,707 --> 00:47:23,708
BUT EVEN IF WE DO BREAK UP,

1707
00:47:23,708 --> 00:47:25,676
WE'VE STILL GOT A LOT OF STUFF

1708
00:47:25,676 --> 00:47:26,844
TO WORK OUT.

1709
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,180
TWO BABIES IS TWICE THE DIAPERS,

1710
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:30,681
TWICE THE FORMULA,

1711
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:32,183
TWICE THE EVERYTHING.

1712
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:33,451
I'M STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL,

1713
00:47:33,451 --> 00:47:34,585
AND I DON'T HAVE A JOB,

1714
00:47:34,585 --> 00:47:35,921
SO COREY NEEDS TO HELP ME

1715
00:47:35,921 --> 00:47:37,923
WITH MONEY.

1716
00:47:37,923 --> 00:47:39,090
I'VE BEEN KEEPING THE GIRLS

1717
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:40,758
WITH ME, BUT COREY WANTS

1718
00:47:40,758 --> 00:47:42,227
TO SEE THEM, SO TONIGHT,

1719
00:47:42,227 --> 00:47:44,862
WE'RE MEETING UP.

1720
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:47,565
>> UM, NO.

1721
00:47:47,565 --> 00:47:48,266
YOU HAVE TO WORK AT 7:00

1722
00:47:48,266 --> 00:47:49,167
IN THE MORNING.

1723
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:49,935
>> I CAN STILL BRING THEM

1724
00:47:49,935 --> 00:47:50,668
DOWN THERE.

1725
00:47:50,668 --> 00:47:51,536
>> NO.

1726
00:47:51,536 --> 00:47:52,537
>> YOUR MOM IS OFF TOMORROW.

1727
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:53,538
>> MM-MM.

1728
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:54,672
EXACTLY, NO.

1729
00:47:54,672 --> 00:47:57,508
>> WHAT?

1730
00:47:57,508 --> 00:48:00,979
EXACTLY WHAT?

1731
00:48:00,979 --> 00:48:02,981
HUH?

1732
00:48:02,981 --> 00:48:05,783
WHY?

1733
00:48:05,783 --> 00:48:08,053
WE'RE TRYING TO WORK STUFF OUT

1734
00:48:08,053 --> 00:48:08,954
FOR OURSELVES SO WE'RE AROUND

1735
00:48:08,954 --> 00:48:10,621
THEM ALL THE TIME, BUT IF WE

1736
00:48:10,621 --> 00:48:11,622
KEEP THIS UP, WE AIN'T GONNA

1737
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:12,157
NEVER WORK IT OUT.

1738
00:48:12,157 --> 00:48:17,095
>> THANK YOU.

1739
00:48:17,095 --> 00:48:19,764
>> I WISH WE COULD SWAP PLACES.

1740
00:48:19,764 --> 00:48:20,731
>> SWAP PLACES?

1741
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:21,732
>> IT'S LIKE I'VE GOT SOME KIND

1742
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:22,567
OF MENTAL PROBLEM.

1743
00:48:22,567 --> 00:48:23,834
I CAN'T SEE MY KIDS BY MYSELF.

1744
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:24,235
>> OH, NO.

1745
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:25,570
>> IT'S LIKE I GOT TO HAVE

1746
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:26,137
VISITED--VISITATION.

1747
00:48:26,137 --> 00:48:26,771
>> YOU ARE CRAZY.

1748
00:48:26,771 --> 00:48:27,372
YOU REALLY ARE CRAZY.

1749
00:48:27,372 --> 00:48:28,239
>> I KNOW, I AM.

1750
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,340
>> I'M SORRY.

1751
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:30,341
>> YOU DROVE ME TO THAT POINT.

1752
00:48:30,341 --> 00:48:31,276
>> I'M SORRY.

1753
00:48:31,276 --> 00:48:33,878
>> I'M SICK OF THIS [bleep].

1754
00:48:39,317 --> 00:48:42,153
ALL I WANT IS MY KIDS.

1755
00:48:42,153 --> 00:48:44,122
ALL.

1756
00:48:47,825 --> 00:48:49,227
>> COREY IS UPSET THAT I WON'T

1757
00:48:49,227 --> 00:48:49,894
LET HIM TAKE THE GIRLS.

1758
00:48:49,894 --> 00:48:51,862
WHEN I ASKED HIM FOR A LITTLE

1759
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:54,632
EXTRA MONEY, HE BLEW UP.

1760
00:48:54,632 --> 00:48:55,366
>> BUT I STILL GOT TO PAY OFF

1761
00:48:55,366 --> 00:48:59,237
 OUR ELECTRIC BILL, OUR RENT,

1762
00:48:59,237 --> 00:49:00,071
 OUR-- 

1763
00:49:00,071 --> 00:49:00,838
>> IT'S FOR THE GIRLS.

1764
00:49:00,838 --> 00:49:02,840
>> OUR DISH AND TRASH BILL.

1765
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,976
>> I CARRIED TWO KIDS FOR

1766
00:49:04,976 --> 00:49:05,977
NINE MONTHS STRAIGHT,

1767
00:49:05,977 --> 00:49:08,679
LIVED IN HELL, OKAY?

1768
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:10,315
>> I WAS RIGHT THERE WITH YOU.

1769
00:49:10,315 --> 00:49:12,117
I WASN'T IN PAIN, BUT BY GOD--

1770
00:49:12,117 --> 00:49:13,018
>> YEAH, YOU DIDN'T GO THROUGH

1771
00:49:13,018 --> 00:49:13,784
IT EITHER.

1772
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,153
>> NO, I CAN'T,

1773
00:49:15,153 --> 00:49:17,255
'CAUSE I CAN'T GET PREGNANT.

1774
00:49:17,255 --> 00:49:18,089
WHAT?

1775
00:49:18,089 --> 00:49:18,923
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT NOW

1776
00:49:18,923 --> 00:49:19,924
OVER THERE, MISS PUCKER LIPS,

1777
00:49:19,924 --> 00:49:20,258
WHAT?

1778
00:49:20,258 --> 00:49:21,026
>> I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO WORK

1779
00:49:21,026 --> 00:49:23,028
FOR NINE MONTHS STRAIGHT BECAUSE

1780
00:49:23,028 --> 00:49:23,528
I WAS PREGNANT.

1781
00:49:23,528 --> 00:49:24,462
>> THEN WE SHOULD HAVE

1782
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:25,096
WORKED IT OUT.

1783
00:49:25,096 --> 00:49:25,930
>> I WAS ON BED REST.

1784
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:26,797
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,

1785
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:27,565
"WE SHOULD HAVE WORKED IT OUT"?

1786
00:49:27,565 --> 00:49:28,333
>> WE SHOULD HAVE WORKED IT OUT

1787
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:29,067
AND STILL BEEN TOGETHER.

1788
00:49:29,067 --> 00:49:29,900
>> IT WASN'T A ONE-NIGHT

1789
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:30,768
DECISION.

1790
00:49:30,768 --> 00:49:31,902
>> I EXPECT EVERYTHING FROM--

1791
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:34,239
>> OH, MY GOD.

1792
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:35,373
>> WHAT?

1793
00:49:35,373 --> 00:49:36,874
>> [screams]

1794
00:49:36,874 --> 00:49:38,376
>> WHAT DID I [bleep] DO?

1795
00:49:38,376 --> 00:49:39,844
>> INSANE.

1796
00:49:39,844 --> 00:49:44,015
[cries]

1797
00:49:44,015 --> 00:49:45,816
>> WHY ARE YOU CRYING?

1798
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:46,451
>> [sobs]

1799
00:49:46,451 --> 00:49:49,387
>> WHY ARE YOU CRYING?

1800
00:50:10,175 --> 00:50:11,309
>> AFTER THAT HUGE ARGUMENT

1801
00:50:11,309 --> 00:50:11,976
WE HAD, COREY PACKED UP

1802
00:50:11,976 --> 00:50:13,778
ALL HIS STUFF AND MOVED OUT

1803
00:50:13,778 --> 00:50:14,945
OF THE APARTMENT.

1804
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:16,814
[baby cries]

1805
00:50:16,814 --> 00:50:18,783
NOW HE LIVES AT HOME WITH

1806
00:50:18,783 --> 00:50:20,285
HIS PARENTS, AND IT'S JUST ME

1807
00:50:20,285 --> 00:50:21,986
TAKING CARE OF ALI AND ALEEAH

1808
00:50:21,986 --> 00:50:26,957
ALL BY MYSELF.

1809
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:28,793
IT'S HARD THIS MORNING.

1810
00:50:28,793 --> 00:50:29,460
>> WHY?

1811
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,129
>> JUST HAVING TO DO IT

1812
00:50:31,129 --> 00:50:33,764
ON MY OWN NOW, I GUESS.

1813
00:50:33,764 --> 00:50:35,100
IT'S JUST--IT'S DIFFERENT FROM

1814
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,434
BEING WITH COREY.

1815
00:50:36,434 --> 00:50:40,805
I KIND OF LIKED THE COMPANY.

1816
00:50:40,805 --> 00:50:41,772
I HAVEN'T BEEN TO SCHOOL

1817
00:50:41,772 --> 00:50:42,973
IN A WEEK 'CAUSE I JUST CAN'T

1818
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:43,841
JUGGLE ALL MY WORK ON TOP OF

1819
00:50:43,841 --> 00:50:47,145
THE TWINS.

1820
00:50:47,145 --> 00:50:48,146
I TALKED TO ROBBIE A COUPLE

1821
00:50:48,146 --> 00:50:49,980
TIMES ON THE PHONE, BUT THEN

1822
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:50,948
HE STOPPED RETURNING MY CALLS.

1823
00:50:50,948 --> 00:50:52,850
I THINK THE TWINS WERE

1824
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:54,985
TOO MUCH FOR HIM.

1825
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:56,321
I CAN'T BLAME HIM 'CAUSE

1826
00:50:56,321 --> 00:50:57,155
SOMETIMES I FEEL LIKE THEY'RE

1827
00:50:57,155 --> 00:51:00,258
TOO MUCH FOR ME TOO.

1828
00:51:00,258 --> 00:51:02,260
OKAY.

1829
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:05,530
HEY.

1830
00:51:05,530 --> 00:51:05,996
>> HEY.

1831
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:10,235
>> MM-HMM.

1832
00:51:10,235 --> 00:51:11,068
AFTER EVERYTHING HAPPENED,

1833
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,903
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO, LIKE,

1834
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:15,440
STAY HOME.

1835
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:18,276
IT'S BEEN KIND OF LONELY.

1836
00:51:18,276 --> 00:51:19,043
>> SO WHAT'S IT LIKE,

1837
00:51:19,043 --> 00:51:20,378
TAKING CARE OF TWO OF THEM

1838
00:51:20,378 --> 00:51:20,978
BY YOURSELF?

1839
00:51:20,978 --> 00:51:23,881
>> HMM, FIRST COUPLE DAYS

1840
00:51:23,881 --> 00:51:25,516
THAT WE WAS HERE, I WAS SO SAD,

1841
00:51:25,516 --> 00:51:30,288
THOUGH, BECAUSE I THINK

1842
00:51:30,288 --> 00:51:31,889
THE GIRLS JUST KNEW THAT I'VE

1843
00:51:31,889 --> 00:51:34,192
BEEN UPSET AND EVERYTHING,

1844
00:51:34,192 --> 00:51:35,193
AND THEY WOULD NOT STOP

1845
00:51:35,193 --> 00:51:36,361
SCREAMING.

1846
00:51:36,361 --> 00:51:37,528
I JUST THINK THERE'S BEEN

1847
00:51:37,528 --> 00:51:40,030
TOO MUCH HURT WITH EVERYTHING

1848
00:51:40,030 --> 00:51:42,367
THAT'S GONE ON.

1849
00:51:42,367 --> 00:51:44,034
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1850
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:46,371
>> LIKE, WITH ME HURTING COREY,

1851
00:51:46,371 --> 00:51:48,373
AND WE BOTH HURT EACH OTHER

1852
00:51:48,373 --> 00:51:49,874
IN A LOT OF WAYS.

1853
00:51:49,874 --> 00:51:51,142
AND THEN I WENT BACK TO ROBBIE.

1854
00:51:51,142 --> 00:51:54,979
WELL, ACTUALLY, ROBBIE STARTED

1855
00:51:54,979 --> 00:51:56,080
COMING AROUND.

1856
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:57,948
>> WHY?

1857
00:51:57,948 --> 00:51:58,449
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1858
00:51:58,449 --> 00:51:59,116
>> HE'S BAD NEWS.

1859
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:01,419
>> HE WAS THERE.

1860
00:52:01,419 --> 00:52:02,187
I FELT LIKE HE LISTENED TO ME.

1861
00:52:02,187 --> 00:52:03,954
I DON'T KNOW.

1862
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,923
AND I WANTED TO ESCAPE FROM--

1863
00:52:05,923 --> 00:52:07,057
LIKE, I MEAN, I KNOW I CAN'T

1864
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:08,393
ESCAPE FROM THE SITUATION THAT

1865
00:52:08,393 --> 00:52:10,161
I'VE GOT MYSELF IN.

1866
00:52:10,161 --> 00:52:11,162
>> NO.

1867
00:52:11,162 --> 00:52:12,330
>> I THOUGHT ROBBIE WAS A WAY

1868
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:17,702
TO, LIKE, BE ABLE TO GET OUT.

1869
00:52:17,702 --> 00:52:20,205
BUT HE'S NOT.

1870
00:52:20,205 --> 00:52:21,138
>> I JUST DON'T SEE WHAT'S

1871
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,540
SO GREAT ABOUT HIM.

1872
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:23,708
ROBBIE'S JUST NOT DADDY

1873
00:52:23,708 --> 00:52:25,243
MATERIAL.

1874
00:52:25,243 --> 00:52:30,581
[baby coos]

1875
00:52:30,581 --> 00:52:31,749
>> ROBBIE'S TOO IMMATURE TO BE

1876
00:52:31,749 --> 00:52:33,518
A GOOD DADDY, BUT THERE AREN'T

1877
00:52:33,518 --> 00:52:35,186
TOO MANY GUYS MY AGE WHO COULD

1878
00:52:35,186 --> 00:52:36,587
DO ANY BETTER.

1879
00:52:36,587 --> 00:52:37,755
COREY'S THE ONLY ONE I CAN

1880
00:52:37,755 --> 00:52:39,424
THINK OF, BUT THINGS WITH US

1881
00:52:39,424 --> 00:52:44,195
ARE WORSE THAN EVER.

1882
00:52:44,195 --> 00:52:45,396
THE ONLY TIME I SEE HIM

1883
00:52:45,396 --> 00:52:47,097
IS WHEN I BRING THE GIRLS BY

1884
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:50,201
HIS PARENTS' HOUSE FOR A VISIT.

1885
00:52:59,544 --> 00:53:02,713
HEY.

1886
00:53:02,713 --> 00:53:04,249
BABY'S ASLEEP.

1887
00:53:04,249 --> 00:53:07,418
>> [chuckles lightly]

1888
00:53:07,418 --> 00:53:08,753
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE HOW AWKWARD

1889
00:53:08,753 --> 00:53:09,320
THINGS ARE NOW.

1890
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,222
ME AND COREY CAN BARELY

1891
00:53:11,222 --> 00:53:13,291
LOOK EACH OTHER IN THE EYE.

1892
00:53:19,464 --> 00:53:22,233
>> SHE IS GETTING BIG.

1893
00:53:25,636 --> 00:53:26,471
>> SEE YOU LATER.

1894
00:53:26,471 --> 00:53:28,105
>> SEE YOU.

1895
00:53:28,105 --> 00:53:28,739
BYE-BYE, GIRLS.

1896
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:29,540
DADDY LOVES YOU A LOT.

1897
00:53:29,540 --> 00:53:30,541
BYE-BYE, BABY GIRL.

1898
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:31,276
I LOVE YOU.

1899
00:53:31,276 --> 00:53:32,743
>> COREY'S A REALLY GOOD DAD,

1900
00:53:32,743 --> 00:53:33,911
AND SEEING HIM WITH THE GIRLS

1901
00:53:33,911 --> 00:53:34,912
MAKES ME WONDER IF I MADE

1902
00:53:34,912 --> 00:53:38,616
A BIG MISTAKE.

1903
00:53:38,616 --> 00:53:39,317
TO MAKE THINGS WORSE,

1904
00:53:39,317 --> 00:53:42,620
TODAY IS VALENTINE'S DAY.

1905
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:44,255
DUDE, IT'S VALENTINE'S.

1906
00:53:44,255 --> 00:53:45,856
>> I DON'T LIKE VALENTINE'S DAY.

1907
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:47,592
DO YOU LIKE VALENTINE'S DAY?

1908
00:53:47,592 --> 00:53:49,360
>> I DO, BUT I LIKE IT BETTER

1909
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,696
WHEN I'M WITH SOMEONE AND

1910
00:53:51,696 --> 00:53:53,864
FEELING ALL SPECIAL, LIKE I'M

1911
00:53:53,864 --> 00:53:55,266
SUPPOSED TO BE IN THIS WORLD

1912
00:53:55,266 --> 00:53:56,467
OR SOMETHING.

1913
00:53:56,467 --> 00:53:57,902
YOU CAN'T BE WITH SOMEBODY

1914
00:53:57,902 --> 00:53:59,437
A YEAR AND NOT LOVE THEM.

1915
00:53:59,437 --> 00:54:02,440
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.

1916
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,909
AND THEN I HAD KIDS WITH COREY,

1917
00:54:04,909 --> 00:54:07,412
SO IT'S LIKE REALLY

1918
00:54:07,412 --> 00:54:08,413
A DIFFERENT LOVE.

1919
00:54:08,413 --> 00:54:10,748
LIKE, I DON'T EVEN KNOW

1920
00:54:10,748 --> 00:54:11,516
HOW TO EXPLAIN IT.

1921
00:54:11,516 --> 00:54:12,383
>> DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO

1922
00:54:12,383 --> 00:54:14,652
LOVE HIM RIGHT NOW?

1923
00:54:14,652 --> 00:54:16,554
>> SOMETIMES, YEAH.

1924
00:54:16,554 --> 00:54:17,855
LIKE, I CAN'T STAND HIM,

1925
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:19,223
BUT I HATE TO SEE HIM LEAVE,

1926
00:54:19,223 --> 00:54:21,626
IF THAT EVEN MAKES SENSE.

1927
00:54:21,626 --> 00:54:25,396
>> ME AND LEAH, WE'RE DONE, MAN.

1928
00:54:25,396 --> 00:54:26,897
>> I'D SAY.

1929
00:54:26,897 --> 00:54:28,265
>> I'M SORRY I CAN'T BE

1930
00:54:28,265 --> 00:54:29,434
AS PERFECT AS ROBBIE.

1931
00:54:29,434 --> 00:54:30,100
I'M SORRY I ACTUALLY TRIED

1932
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:30,801
TO MAKE IT WORK IN MY LIFE.

1933
00:54:30,801 --> 00:54:32,737
I TRIED TO ACHIEVE GOALS AND

1934
00:54:32,737 --> 00:54:35,606
MAKE IT BEST FOR MY FAMILY,

1935
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:36,474
BUT YOU DIDN'T WANT NO PART

1936
00:54:36,474 --> 00:54:37,442
OF IT, AND NOW YOU'RE REGRETTING

1937
00:54:37,442 --> 00:54:38,042
EVERY BIT OF IT.

1938
00:54:38,042 --> 00:54:40,511
THAT AIN'T MY PROBLEM.

1939
00:54:40,511 --> 00:54:41,879
I DID NOT--I DID NOT

1940
00:54:41,879 --> 00:54:42,847
HAVE TO SELL THAT TRUCK.

1941
00:54:42,847 --> 00:54:43,881
I DID NOT HAVE TO WORK

1942
00:54:43,881 --> 00:54:44,649
TWO JOBS.

1943
00:54:44,649 --> 00:54:47,485
I DID NOT HAVE TO MOVE OUT.

1944
00:54:47,485 --> 00:54:48,152
I DID NOT HAVE TO BUY HER

1945
00:54:48,152 --> 00:54:50,988
EVERYTHING.

1946
00:54:50,988 --> 00:54:52,357
I HAD TO DO NONE OF IT,

1947
00:54:52,357 --> 00:54:53,123
BUT I DID IT BECAUSE I WANTED IT

1948
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:53,491
TO WORK.

1949
00:54:53,491 --> 00:54:55,560
AND WHAT REALLY SUCKS IS,

1950
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,762
IS FROM DAY ONE,

1951
00:54:57,762 --> 00:54:59,063
I WAS JUST LIKE A REBOUND

1952
00:54:59,063 --> 00:55:00,064
TO GET OVER ROBBIE, AND THEN

1953
00:55:00,064 --> 00:55:01,566
YOU GOT STUCK WITH ME NOW.

1954
00:55:01,566 --> 00:55:06,637
[singing indistinctly]

1955
00:55:06,637 --> 00:55:07,338
HEY, YOU WANT TO PULL OVER

1956
00:55:07,338 --> 00:55:08,773
AND TALK TO THEM?

1957
00:55:08,773 --> 00:55:09,507
>> WHERE THEY AT?

1958
00:55:09,507 --> 00:55:10,408
>> OVER THERE.

1959
00:55:10,408 --> 00:55:10,941
>> YEAH, GO.

1960
00:55:10,941 --> 00:55:13,944
>> [laughs]

1961
00:55:13,944 --> 00:55:15,112
HEY, ARE WE STILL HANGING OUT

1962
00:55:15,112 --> 00:55:16,481
TONIGHT, THOUGH?

1963
00:55:16,481 --> 00:55:17,548
HUH?

1964
00:55:17,548 --> 00:55:18,248
>> WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

1965
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:18,983
>> NOTHING.

1966
00:55:18,983 --> 00:55:19,750
ARE WE HANGING OUT LATER?

1967
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:20,117
>> YEAH.

1968
00:55:20,117 --> 00:55:20,551
>> OKAY.

1969
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:22,420
>> I HEARD RUMORS THAT COREY

1970
00:55:22,420 --> 00:55:24,054
WAS DATING SOMEONE NEW,

1971
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:25,556
BUT THEY CAN'T BE TRUE.

1972
00:55:25,556 --> 00:55:27,558
WE ONLY JUST BROKE UP.

1973
00:55:27,558 --> 00:55:29,694
IT SCARED ME, THOUGH,

1974
00:55:29,694 --> 00:55:30,628
AND I DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE

1975
00:55:30,628 --> 00:55:32,129
TONIGHT, SO MY FRIEND KAYLA

1976
00:55:32,129 --> 00:55:34,098
IS KEEPING ME COMPANY.

1977
00:55:42,740 --> 00:55:43,608
ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT

1978
00:55:43,608 --> 00:55:45,443
IS COREY OUT WITH ANOTHER GIRL

1979
00:55:45,443 --> 00:55:48,613
ON VALENTINE'S DAY.

1980
00:55:48,613 --> 00:55:50,548
I DIDN'T THINK MY NIGHT

1981
00:55:50,548 --> 00:55:51,916
COULD GET ANY WORSE,

1982
00:55:51,916 --> 00:55:52,650
BUT ON THE WAY HOME, WE RAN

1983
00:55:52,650 --> 00:55:55,085
INTO SOME OF COREY'S FRIENDS.

1984
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:55,820
>> YOU HAVE THE BABIES.

1985
00:55:55,820 --> 00:55:57,722
I WANT TO SEE THEM.

1986
00:55:57,722 --> 00:55:58,088
>> LOOK.

1987
00:55:58,088 --> 00:55:58,789
I'M GOING HOME TO TAKE CARE

1988
00:55:58,789 --> 00:56:00,625
OF BABIES.

1989
00:56:00,625 --> 00:56:01,626
I WAS SCARED COREY WAS GONNA

1990
00:56:01,626 --> 00:56:03,594
BE UP HERE.

1991
00:56:04,228 --> 00:56:06,196
ARE YOU [bleep] ME?

1992
00:56:07,765 --> 00:56:09,734
>> WHAT?

1993
00:56:11,836 --> 00:56:12,637
>> YEAH, YOU MISSED HIM BY,

1994
00:56:12,637 --> 00:56:13,003
LIKE...

1995
00:56:13,003 --> 00:56:14,605
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?

1996
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:21,078
>> THAT PISSES ME OFF.

1997
00:56:21,078 --> 00:56:21,779
>> ALL RIGHT, WELL,

1998
00:56:21,779 --> 00:56:23,648
I'M GOING HOME.

1999
00:56:23,648 --> 00:56:24,148
IT'S ALL RIGHT,

2000
00:56:24,148 --> 00:56:26,183
BUT I'M GOING HOME.

2001
00:56:26,183 --> 00:56:26,851
>> ALL RIGHT.

2002
00:56:26,851 --> 00:56:27,852
JUST [bleep] LEAVE ME.

2003
00:56:27,852 --> 00:56:29,019
YOU BITCHED AT ME FOR IT.

2004
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:30,020
>> SORRY, I'M GOING HOME.

2005
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:31,656
>> ALL RIGHT, GIVE ME A HOLLER.

2006
00:56:31,656 --> 00:56:32,657
>> DO YOU SEE HIM?

2007
00:56:32,657 --> 00:56:33,724
>> ARE THEY SITTING IN THERE?

2008
00:56:33,724 --> 00:56:36,594
>> MM-HMM.

2009
00:56:36,594 --> 00:56:37,595
>> I SEE PAIGE AND ASHLEY,

2010
00:56:37,595 --> 00:56:40,230
BUT I DON'T SEE COREY.

2011
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:41,165
>> THAT'S HIS CAR.

2012
00:56:41,165 --> 00:56:42,166
>> YEAH.

2013
00:56:42,166 --> 00:56:46,170
>> OH, MY GOD.

2014
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:49,173
[sniffles]

2015
00:56:52,677 --> 00:56:53,811
THIS AIN'T COOL.

2016
00:56:53,811 --> 00:56:57,982
THIS IS NOT COOL AT ALL.

2017
00:56:57,982 --> 00:57:00,317
I'M SORRY, BUT I'M GOING HOME.

2018
00:57:00,317 --> 00:57:01,752
I'M GOING HOME TO SIT--

2019
00:57:01,752 --> 00:57:03,654
AND YOU KNOW, TO TAKE CARE

2020
00:57:03,654 --> 00:57:04,789
OF KIDS.

2021
00:57:04,789 --> 00:57:06,991
YOU KNOW WHAT, I BLAME THAT

2022
00:57:06,991 --> 00:57:07,858
[bleep] ON MYSELF.

2023
00:57:07,858 --> 00:57:10,961
YOU KNOW?

2024
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:11,462
I HATE MY LIFE.

2025
00:57:11,462 --> 00:57:15,332
I REALLY DO.

2026
00:57:15,332 --> 00:57:18,302
[sniffles]

2027
00:57:22,673 --> 00:57:24,975
JUST KIND OF HURTS,

2028
00:57:24,975 --> 00:57:27,244
REALLY BAD.

2029
00:57:31,982 --> 00:57:33,317
THIS IS THE WORST VALENTINE'S

2030
00:57:33,317 --> 00:57:47,798
DAY EVER.

2031

>> VALENTINE'S DAY WAS THE WORST

2032

DAY OF MY LIFE.

2033

SEEING COREY WITH ANOTHER GIRL

2034
00:57:52,670 --> 00:57:54,171
REALLY HURT ME.

2035

2036
00:58:01,045 --> 00:58:01,879
>> YOU'RE REALLY HURT HIM, BAD.

2037
00:58:01,879 --> 00:58:03,848
HE DIDN'T DESERVE IT.

2038
00:58:03,848 --> 00:58:04,882
>> NO, I KNOW.

2039
00:58:04,882 --> 00:58:05,750

YOU KNOW, ME LOSING COREY AND

2042
00:58:09,353 --> 00:58:11,188
HIM BEING SO SERIOUS ABOUT IT,

2043
00:58:11,188 --> 00:58:12,056
ALL OF A SUDDEN HAS MADE ME

2044
00:58:12,056 --> 00:58:14,892
REALIZE, YOU KNOW, YOU NEVER

2045
00:58:14,892 --> 00:58:16,060
KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE UNTIL

2046
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:17,962
IT'S GONE.

2047
00:58:17,962 --> 00:58:18,663
>> DEFINITELY.

2048
00:58:18,663 --> 00:58:19,363
>> AND YOU NEVER REALIZE HOW

2049
00:58:19,363 --> 00:58:20,665
MUCH YOU CARE ABOUT SOMEBODY

2050
00:58:20,665 --> 00:58:21,932
OR WANT THEM AROUND YOU ALL

2051
00:58:21,932 --> 00:58:25,302
THE TIME UNTIL IT'S NOT THERE.

2052
00:58:26,671 --> 00:58:29,139
I THINK THINGS ARE REALLY OVER

2053
00:58:29,139 --> 00:58:31,208
WITH COREY, AND I BLAME MYSELF

2054
00:58:31,208 --> 00:58:33,644
FOR RUINING OUR FAMILY.

2055
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:38,415
I USED TO BE THIS HAPPY,

2058
00:58:42,319 --> 00:58:43,220
OF COURSE.

2059

ALWAYS, I WAS, LIKE, ALL PEPPY.

2060
00:58:44,755 --> 00:58:46,891
AND I MEAN, SOME PEOPLE STILL

2061
00:58:46,891 --> 00:58:49,059
ARE LIKE THAT AFTER HAVING KIDS,

2062
00:58:49,059 --> 00:58:50,227
AND I'M NOT LIKE THAT ANYMORE.

2063
00:58:50,227 --> 00:58:52,129
I JUST FEEL LIKE MY LIFE'S BEEN,

2064
00:58:52,129 --> 00:58:53,497
LIKE, SUCKED RIGHT OUT OF ME.

2065
00:58:53,497 --> 00:58:55,833
AT MY AGE, GIRLS ARE, LIKE,

2067
00:58:57,234 --> 00:58:58,235

HUH?

2104
01:00:30,661 --> 01:00:33,063
I MADE A LOT OF MISTAKES.

I WISH I COULD TAKE EVERY

2106
01:00:34,398 --> 01:00:39,103
BIT OF IT BACK, BUT I CAN'T.

2107
01:00:39,103 --> 01:00:41,071
ME AND COREY, OUR RELATIONSHIP

2108
01:00:41,071 --> 01:00:44,041
IS NOT THE SAME ANYMORE.

2109

01:00:55,085 --> 01:01:00,124
TO BE WITH ME.

2113
01:01:00,124 --> 01:01:01,291
IT'S REALLY HARD HAVING

2114
01:01:01,291 --> 01:01:03,293
TWO BABIES AT THE SAME TIME

2115
01:01:03,293 --> 01:01:04,461
AND ESPECIALLY NOT HAVING COREY

2116

AROUND.

2117
01:01:05,295 --> 01:01:07,431
WE CAN'T DO IT TOGETHER.

2118
01:01:07,431 --> 01:01:08,198

TWO BABIES.

2126
01:01:18,142 --> 01:01:19,777
I WAS TRYING TO BE A NORMAL

17-YEAR-OLD AGAIN,

2128
01:01:21,712 --> 01:01:25,482

TAKE IT BACK AND CHANGE THINGS.
