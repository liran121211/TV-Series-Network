1
00:00:04,105 --> 00:00:05,673
>> HI, I'M CLEONDRA.

2
00:00:05,673 --> 00:00:06,607
HELLO.

3
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:07,908
[laughs]

4
00:00:07,908 --> 00:00:09,310
I'M 17 YEARS OLD AND FROM

5
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:11,045
HORN LAKE, MISSISSIPPI--

6
00:00:11,045 --> 00:00:12,012
RIGHT ACROSS THE RIVER FROM

7
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:13,447
MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE.

8
00:00:13,447 --> 00:00:15,183
I LOVE TO DANCE.

9
00:00:15,183 --> 00:00:16,450
AND LAST YEAR, MY SCHOOL DANCE

10
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,551
TEAM MADE IT ALL THE WAY TO THE

11
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:19,187
NATIONAL TOURNAMENT.

12
00:00:19,187 --> 00:00:20,254
NOW I'M A SENIOR, AND I CAN'T

13
00:00:20,254 --> 00:00:21,722
WAIT TO GO OFF TO COLLEGE

14
00:00:21,722 --> 00:00:24,158
AND STUDY PHYSICAL THERAPY.

15
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:25,393
MY MOM RAISED FOUR KIDS,

16
00:00:25,393 --> 00:00:26,527
SO MY HOUSE HAS ALWAYS BEEN

17
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:27,561
KIND OF HECTIC.

18
00:00:27,561 --> 00:00:28,396
>> RAH!

19
00:00:28,396 --> 00:00:29,397
>> RAH!

20
00:00:29,397 --> 00:00:30,331
ESPECIALLY AFTER MY SISTER

21
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:31,499
ZERICA HAD HER BABY.

22
00:00:31,499 --> 00:00:33,033
SHE WAS ONLY 17 AND REALLY

23
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,335
STRUGGLED WITH MOTHERHOOD

24
00:00:34,335 --> 00:00:35,503
IN THE BEGINNING.

25
00:00:35,503 --> 00:00:36,837
>> I HAD TO GET USED TO THIS,

26
00:00:36,837 --> 00:00:37,505
CLEONDRA.

27
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:38,506
I WASN'T USED TO THIS.

28
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:39,773
>> SO I'VE SPENT THE LAST TWO

29
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:40,941
YEARS HELPING MY MOM RAISE

30
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:42,343
MY NIECE.

31
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:43,877
LUCKILY, I DIDN'T HAVE TO GO FAR

32
00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,279
TO MEET MY BOYFRIEND, MARIO.

33
00:00:45,279 --> 00:00:46,714
LOOK OUT YOUR WINDOW.

34
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:47,815
>> HEY, BABY.

35
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:48,749
>> HE LIVES RIGHT ACROSS

36
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:49,483
THE STREET.

37
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:50,484
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER A COUPLE

38
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:51,819
OF YEARS, BUT LATELY,

39
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:53,020
WE HAVEN'T SPENT MUCH QUALITY

40
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:54,255
TIME TOGETHER BECAUSE HE WORKS

41
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:55,289
SO MUCH.

42
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:56,590
AND WHEN HE GETS HOME, HE'S

43
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:57,525
ALWAYS TOO TIRED TO DO

44
00:00:57,525 --> 00:00:58,859
ANYTHING FUN.

45
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,060
BUT MARIO'S NOT GONNA GET MUCH

46
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,229
SLEEP NOW.

47
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:02,330
AND ZYRA'S NOT GONNA BE

48
00:01:02,330 --> 00:01:03,697
THE BABY OF THE FAMILY ANYMORE

49
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:05,599
EITHER, BECAUSE I'M PREGNANT.

52
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:13,941
LIVING ACROSS THE STREET

53
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:15,309
FROM MARIO IS GREAT.

54
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:16,444
HE MOVED THERE WITH HIS DAD

55
00:01:16,444 --> 00:01:17,611
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO, AND IT

56
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:18,779
DIDN'T TAKE US LONG TO NOTICE

57
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:19,913
EACH OTHER.

58
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:23,184
I REMEMBER WHEN I FIRST SAW YOU.

59
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:25,953
YOU WERE WALKING TO JESSE'S VAN.

60
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:27,221
YOU JUST HAD A JACKET,

61
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:28,122
AND YOU WERE SHIRTLESS.

62
00:01:28,122 --> 00:01:30,057
I WAS LIKE, "DAMN, HE'S FINE."

63
00:01:30,057 --> 00:01:31,091
>> I WAS PHYSICALLY ATTRACTED

64
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:32,025
TO YOU.

65
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:33,327
>> [laughs]

66
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:34,795
>> THEN I GOT TO KNOW YOU AND

67
00:01:34,795 --> 00:01:36,497
THOUGHT YOU WERE PRETTY COOL.

68
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:37,498
>> WHEN WE FIRST FOUND OUT

69
00:01:37,498 --> 00:01:39,433
I WAS PREGNANT, I WAS SCARED.

70
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:40,368
>> YOU GOT A LITTLE BABY

71
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:41,435
IN YOUR STOMACH.

72
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:42,636
>> I WAS SHAKING.

73
00:01:42,636 --> 00:01:43,537
RIGHT WHEN I FOUND OUT,

74
00:01:43,537 --> 00:01:44,538
I WAS JUST, LIKE--

75
00:01:44,538 --> 00:01:46,540
"I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO."

76
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,076
>> I'M STILL A LITTLE, UM,

77
00:01:49,076 --> 00:01:50,911
WORRIED, I GUESS, ABOUT IT.

78
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:54,648
LIFE'S DIFFICULT ENOUGH WITHOUT

79
00:01:54,648 --> 00:01:56,049
TAKING CARE OF A BABY.

80
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:57,185
>> IT'S LIKE I'M USED TO IT.

81
00:01:57,185 --> 00:01:58,219
'CAUSE I ALREADY, LIKE, I AM

82
00:01:58,219 --> 00:01:59,753
LIKE A MOM TO ZYRA, AND IT'S

83
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:01,222
LIKE I ALREADY BEEN THROUGH THE

84
00:02:01,222 --> 00:02:03,624
WHOLE NEWBORN STAGE AND...

85
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:04,925
>> YEAH.

86
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,294
>> GROWING UP TO TWO AND...

87
00:02:06,294 --> 00:02:07,228
>> I HOPE YOUR MOM OR JUST

88
00:02:07,228 --> 00:02:08,329
SOMEBODY DOESN'T THINK THAT

89
00:02:08,329 --> 00:02:10,564
WE'RE GONNA BE RAISING TWO

90
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:12,166
AT THE SAME TIME.

91
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,368
IT DOESN'T SOUND TOO GOOD

92
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:16,504
OF A SITUATION TO ME.

93
00:02:16,504 --> 00:02:17,638
>> MARIO IS RIGHT.

94
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:18,772
THERE'S NO WAY I'LL BE ABLE

95
00:02:18,772 --> 00:02:20,774
TO HANDLE TWO KIDS AT ONCE.

96
00:02:20,774 --> 00:02:21,475
BYE, BABE.

97
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,011
>> BYE.

98
00:02:24,011 --> 00:02:25,279
>> BUT SINCE MY SISTER JUST KIND

99
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:27,215
OF COMES AND GOES, MY MOM HAS

100
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:28,048
ALWAYS RELIED ON ME

101
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:29,650
TO HELP RAISE ZYRA.

102
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:34,855
GO TO MY ROOM.

103
00:02:34,855 --> 00:02:36,224
BE CAREFUL.

104
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:38,091
>> BOUNCY, BOUNCY.

105
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:40,328
QUICKLY, QUICKLY, QUICKLY.

106
00:02:40,328 --> 00:02:41,329
>> ZYRA, STOP.

107
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:42,763
>> RAH!

108
00:02:42,763 --> 00:02:43,764
>> ZYRA CAN DEFINITELY BE

109
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:45,433
A HANDFUL SOMETIMES, SO MY MOM

110
00:02:45,433 --> 00:02:46,600
WASN'T THRILLED WHEN I TOLD HER

111
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,635
ANOTHER GRANDBABY

112
00:02:47,635 --> 00:02:48,802
WAS ON THE WAY.

113
00:02:48,802 --> 00:02:49,770
>> HOW IN THE WORLD DID YOU

114
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,538
END UP PREGNANT?

115
00:02:50,538 --> 00:02:52,139
HOW DID YOU FEEL?

116
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:53,641
>> MY HEART SANK.

117
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:54,908
AND I COULDN'T STOP CRYING

118
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,544
'CAUSE I WAS DISAPPOINTED

119
00:02:56,544 --> 00:02:57,578
IN MYSELF.

120
00:02:57,578 --> 00:03:02,316
>> AND I WAS SO ANGRY.

121
00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:03,484
>> MM-HMM.

122
00:03:03,484 --> 00:03:05,553
>> BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT I

123
00:03:05,553 --> 00:03:06,587
MADE IT A POINT TO MAKE SURE

124
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:08,155
WE'D HAD YOU THE BIG OLD BOX

125
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:10,123
OF CONDOMS AND WAS READING ALL

126
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,626
THE PAMPHLETS OF SAFE SEX.

127
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:15,563
SO IT WAS VERY...

128
00:03:15,563 --> 00:03:17,965
YOU SAID YOUR HEART DROPPED.

129
00:03:17,965 --> 00:03:22,002
SO DID MINE.

130
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:23,070
>> I JUST DON'T LIKE LOOKING

131
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:25,005
BACK ON IT 'CAUSE IT STILL

132
00:03:25,005 --> 00:03:26,907
DISAPPOINTS ME.

133
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:29,577
>> I THOUGHT THAT YOU WOULDN'T

134
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:30,811
END UP IN THE SITUATION

135
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:32,646
YOU'RE IN, AND I THOUGHT YOU

136
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:34,282
WAS A LITTLE MORE CAREFUL

137
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:37,184
AND CAUTIOUS THAN WHAT YOU WERE.

138
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:38,552
AND THAT'S WHAT HURT THE MOST.

139
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:39,887
AT THE BEGINNING, YOU AGREED

140
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:40,954
ON HAVING AN ABORTION.

141
00:03:40,954 --> 00:03:42,222
YOU WANTED TO HAVE THE ABORTION.

142
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,090
>> HE GOT THE MONEY

143
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,692
AND EVERYTHING FOR IT.

144
00:03:44,692 --> 00:03:45,793
AND THEN, LIKE, YOU HAD TO HAVE

145
00:03:45,793 --> 00:03:47,895
A PARENT CONSENT ON IT, OR YOU

146
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,630
COULD DO THIS THING, LIKE,

147
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,499
JUDICIAL BYPASS.

148
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:53,200
BUT, LIKE, YOU HAD TO GO IN

149
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,302
FRONT OF A JUDGE AND EVERYTHING,

150
00:03:54,302 --> 00:03:56,304
AND IT'S TOO CRUCIAL, SO I WAS

151
00:03:56,304 --> 00:03:57,538
JUST, LIKE, I'M GONNA HAVE TO

152
00:03:57,538 --> 00:03:58,439
TALK TO MY MOM.

153
00:03:58,439 --> 00:03:59,440
>> AND I WAS ALL FOR YOU

154
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,941
HAVING THE ABORTION BECAUSE OF

155
00:04:00,941 --> 00:04:02,276
YOUR FUTURE.

156
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:03,210
AND I DIDN'T WANT NOTHING

157
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:04,412
HOLDING YOU BACK, BECAUSE YOU'RE

158
00:04:04,412 --> 00:04:07,315
SUCH A BRIGHT GIRL.

159
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:08,349
>> I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THE

160
00:04:08,349 --> 00:04:09,583
RESPONSIBLE CHILD, AND I HATE

161
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,452
FEELING LIKE I LET MY MOM DOWN.

162
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:13,521
MY FAMILY IS PRETTY TIGHT.

163
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:14,688
WE HAVE TO BE IN SUCH

164
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:15,523
A LITTLE HOUSE.

165
00:04:15,523 --> 00:04:16,624
>> CLEONDRA'S A CHEATER.

166
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:17,525
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO--

167
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:18,659
[laughing]

168
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:19,760
>> BUT SINCE I GOT PREGNANT,

169
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,028
THINGS HAVE BEEN A BIT MORE

170
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:21,862
TENSE.

171
00:04:21,862 --> 00:04:22,863
>> THE MOST THING THAT MADE ME

172
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:24,898
UPSET WAS, FOR ONE, YOU DIDN'T

173
00:04:24,898 --> 00:04:26,133
TELL ME.

174
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:28,336
AND THEN ANOTHER THING, I JUST--

175
00:04:28,336 --> 00:04:29,337
I DIDN'T THINK YOU WAS GONNA

176
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:31,872
BE PREGNANT AT AGE 16.

177
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:34,241
AND THEN YOU WAS ON DANCE TEAM.

178
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:35,509
YOU HAD A LOT OF THINGS GOING.

179
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:37,244
>> JAVON WAS MAD.

180
00:04:37,244 --> 00:04:40,013
GOING AROUND DOING CRAZY STUFF.

181
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,215
>> SLAMMING DOORS.

182
00:04:42,215 --> 00:04:43,351
>> both: PUNCHING WALLS.

183
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:44,418
AND STUFF.

184
00:04:44,418 --> 00:04:45,453
>> 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW

185
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:46,219
WHAT YOU TOLD ME.

186
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:47,220
YOU WAS LIKE, "YOU'RE GONNA BE

187
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,356
AN UNCLE."

188
00:04:48,356 --> 00:04:49,357
AND I WAS LIKE, "IS ZERICA

189
00:04:49,357 --> 00:04:50,257
PREGNANT AGAIN?"

190
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:51,459
AND YOU WAS LIKE, "NO."

191
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:52,292
>> WHAT?

192
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,226
>> I THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE

193
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:54,194
SMARTER THAN THAT.

194
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:55,195
BEING PREGNANT GONNA HOLD YOU

195
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:56,630
BACK FROM A LOT OF THINGS.

196
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,565
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

197
00:04:57,565 --> 00:04:58,566
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE YOUR EVENTS

198
00:04:58,566 --> 00:04:59,833
AND THEN THE DANCE TEAM.

199
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,234
YOU WAS ONLY IN IT FOR ONE YEAR

200
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:02,302
BEFORE YOU QUIT.

201
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,504
SO TWO YEARS COULD HAVE

202
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:04,538
GOT YOU A SCHOLARSHIP,

203
00:05:04,538 --> 00:05:06,273
GOT YOU ON TO COLLEGE

204
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:07,641
OR SOMETHING--PAID FOR.

205
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:08,809
>> SO WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO

206
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:09,677
NOW?

207
00:05:09,677 --> 00:05:10,611
>> I MEAN, I'LL STILL DO

208
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:13,547
WHAT I DO.

209
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:14,515
I DON'T WANT THIS PREGNANCY

210
00:05:14,515 --> 00:05:16,116
TO HOLD ME BACK FROM ANYTHING.

211
00:05:16,116 --> 00:05:18,151
BUT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE

212
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,453
A DANCER, AND NOT BEING ABLE TO

213
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:20,988
DANCE MY SENIOR YEAR

214
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,155
REALLY SUCKS.

215
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,323
I DON'T SEE MY FRIENDS AS MUCH

216
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:25,025
SINCE I QUIT THE DANCE TEAM.

217
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,460
BUT WHEN THEY HEARD I WAS HAVING

218
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,628
A LITTLE GIRL, THEY WANTED TO

219
00:05:27,628 --> 00:05:29,463
GET TOGETHER AND CATCH UP.

220
00:05:29,463 --> 00:05:30,498
>> I MISS DANCE.

221
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:32,500
>> I MISS DANCE TOO.

222
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,402
WE WERE REALLY GOOD, MAN.

223
00:05:34,402 --> 00:05:35,335
WE MADE IT ALL THE WAY TO

224
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,003
NATIONALS.

225
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,304
>> WE WERE LIKE THIS.

226
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:38,071
>> I KNOW.

227
00:05:38,071 --> 00:05:39,673
TEN SISTERS.

228
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:41,074
NOW WE'RE SO FAR APART.

229
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,042
>> AND YOU WERE BETTER THAN

230
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:43,411
A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT WAS ON IT.

231
00:05:43,411 --> 00:05:44,878
>> I CAN'T DO NO HIGH "V"s

232
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:46,346
NO MORE.

233
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:47,581
>> HOW'S IT FEELING?

234
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,750
LIKE...HAS SHE BEEN KICKING?

235
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:50,818
>> AT NIGHT, IT'S LIKE SHE

236
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:52,285
TICKLES ME.

237
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:53,621
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S WEIRD.

238
00:05:53,621 --> 00:05:54,588
>> SEE, I WANT TO KNOW WHAT

239
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:55,355
THAT FEELS LIKE.

240
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,323
>> IT'S HARD TO DESCRIBE.

241
00:05:56,323 --> 00:05:58,358
WHEN SHE, LIKE, ROLLS AND MOVES,

242
00:05:58,358 --> 00:05:59,159
IT'S LIKE--

243
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:00,160
>> DOES IT HURT?

244
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,028
>> NO, IT JUST--

245
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,630
>> JUST, LIKE, FEELS FUNNY?

246
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:03,764
LIKE BUTTERFLIES?

247
00:06:03,764 --> 00:06:05,032
>> I JUST CAN'T DO, LIKE,

248
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,133
NORMAL STUFF.

249
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:08,235
I CAN BARELY PICK ZYRA UP NOW.

250
00:06:08,235 --> 00:06:09,603
>> DO, LIKE, YOU EVER, LIKE,

251
00:06:09,603 --> 00:06:12,640
WONDER IF PEOPLE THINK YOU'RE...

252
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:14,107
A HO?

253
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:15,142
>> NO, I DON'T CARE.

254
00:06:15,142 --> 00:06:16,209
'CAUSE THE PEOPLE I HANG OUT

255
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:17,277
WITH KNOW I AIN'T.

256
00:06:17,277 --> 00:06:18,311
THEY KNOW I'VE BEEN WITH MARIO

257
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:20,313
SINCE FOREVER.

258
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,015
>> I USED TO, LIKE, BE LIKE,

259
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:22,916
"CAN YOU CLOSE YOUR LEGS

260
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:23,551
PLEASE?"

261
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:24,217

00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:26,153
BUT THEN I WAS, LIKE, WELL,

>> IT JUST HAPPENS.

266
00:06:29,056 --> 00:06:30,023
>> YEAH, IT JUST HAPPENS.

269
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,527
FOR IT.

270
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:34,728
AND I'M JUST LIKE, "DON'T."

271
00:06:34,728 --> 00:06:35,696
'CAUSE I WASN'T LIKE KICKING

272
00:06:35,696 --> 00:06:37,164

[rock music]

275
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:41,769
I DON'T WANT TO BEAT MYSELF UP

276
00:06:41,769 --> 00:06:43,403
OVER GETTING PREGNANT, BUT

277
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,172
MARIO STILL FEELS REALLY GUILTY

278
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:46,339
ABOUT IT.

279
00:06:46,339 --> 00:06:47,441
AS SOON AS WE FOUND OUT, HE

280
00:06:47,441 --> 00:06:48,709
DROPPED HIS PLANS TO JOIN THE

281
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:50,043
ARMY AND GOT A FULL-TIME JOB

282
00:06:50,043 --> 00:06:51,579
AT THE TIRE SHOP.

283
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:52,913
AND SINCE MARIO HATES ALL THE

284
00:06:52,913 --> 00:06:54,648
CHAOS AT MY HOUSE, HE STARTED

285
00:06:54,648 --> 00:06:55,949
FIXING UP HIS PLACE BECAUSE I

286
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:57,317
THINK HE WANTS US TO LIVE THERE

287
00:06:57,317 --> 00:07:00,220
WHEN THE BABY COMES.

288
00:07:00,220 --> 00:07:01,254
LOOK AT THESE.

289
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,656

SEE? IT SAYS "LITTLE PRINCESS."

291
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,259
>> I'M TIRED.

LIKE, HERE, LIKE, AT THE

300
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:17,571
BEGINNING A LOT MORE.

CAN'T PLAN ABOUT A BABY.

AND WH--EVERYTHING WE WOULD NEED

341
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,026

COULDN'T PLAN IT OUT

343
00:08:13,994 --> 00:08:15,696

EASIEST SITUATION IN EVERY WAY.

A FAMILY LIVING UNDER THE SAME

351
00:08:30,911 --> 00:08:34,181
ROOF IS JUST...

352
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,849
NORMAL.

353

>> I KNOW IT'S NORMAL, BUT

354
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,385
USUALLY, WITH TEEN PREGNANCIES,

355
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:39,419
THAT'S NOT HOW THEY

TO LIVE TOGETHER AS A FAMILY,

361

BUT THE THOUGHT OF LEAVING HOME

362
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:53,934
IS MAKING ME NERVOUS.

YOU JUST ACT LIKE YOU WERE

602
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:15,282

603
00:15:15,282 --> 00:15:17,450
AN ATTITUDE WHEN--

00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,872
>> CAN YOU COME OVER AND HELP ME

1119
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,207
WITH KYLEE?

1120
00:30:41,207 --> 00:30:42,942
>> I JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE

1121
00:30:42,942 --> 00:30:43,775
DOING NOTHING TODAY.

1122
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:44,643
I DON'T FEEL LIKE JUST

1123
00:30:44,643 --> 00:30:46,178
HANGING OUT OR ANYTHING.

1124
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,618
>> I'M TIRED TOO.

1125
00:30:52,618 --> 00:30:57,924
I NEED HELP PUTTING HER DOWN.

1126
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:02,929
>> OKAY, WHATEVER.

1127
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:06,165
>> BYE.

1128
00:31:06,165 --> 00:31:07,799
>> MARIO KEEPS PESTERING ME

1129
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:10,302
ABOUT MOVING IN WITH HIM,

1130
00:31:10,302 --> 00:31:11,303
BUT I DON'T THINK HE REALIZES

1131
00:31:11,303 --> 00:31:12,204
WHAT IT'S LIKE BEING UP

1132
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,440
WITH A BABY ALL NIGHT.

1133
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,108
MOM?

1134
00:31:16,108 --> 00:31:17,443
COULD I SPEND THE NIGHT AT

1135
00:31:17,443 --> 00:31:18,610
MARIO'S TONIGHT?

1136
00:31:18,610 --> 00:31:19,578
>> WHY?

1137
00:31:19,578 --> 00:31:23,115
>> BECAUSE HE'S BEEN, LIKE,

1138
00:31:23,115 --> 00:31:24,316
KIND OF PRESSURING ME ABOUT

1139
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:26,418
MOVING IN TO HIS HOUSE AND I

1140
00:31:26,418 --> 00:31:29,121
JUST WANT HIM TO SEE, LIKE, HOW

1141
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:30,522
IT IS TO DO A NEWBORN.

1142
00:31:30,522 --> 00:31:31,623
'CAUSE YOU KNOW HOW HE'S ALWAYS

1143
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:33,059
TIRED AND STUFF AND HE ALWAYS

1144
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:34,326
WANTS TO SLEEP AND EVERYTHING,

1145
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:36,028
AND HE'S NOT GONNA BE ONE TO PUT

1146
00:31:36,028 --> 00:31:38,264
UP WITH A NEWBORN BABY.

1147
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:39,398
>> I DON'T REALLY CARE FOR

1148
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:42,268
THE IDEA BECAUSE I DON'T WANT

1149
00:31:42,268 --> 00:31:43,302
YOU GETTING USED TO SPENDING

1150
00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:44,403
THE NIGHT OVER THERE BECAUSE

1151
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:45,404
YOU'VE NEVER GOT TO SPEND

1152
00:31:45,404 --> 00:31:46,272
THE NIGHT.

1153
00:31:46,272 --> 00:31:47,706
AND I DON'T WANT HIM GETTING

1154
00:31:47,706 --> 00:31:49,741
COMFORTABLE THINKING YOU CAN

1155
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,077
JUST COME SPEND THE NIGHT.

1156
00:31:51,077 --> 00:31:52,979
>> HE KNOWS IT'S UP TO YOU.

1157
00:31:52,979 --> 00:31:53,912
>> BUT IN ORDER TO PROVE

1158
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:55,881
A POINT, I GUESS I'M OKAY

1159
00:31:55,881 --> 00:31:56,715
WITH IT NOW.

1160
00:31:56,715 --> 00:31:59,018
YOU NEED TO MAKE HIM BE THE ONE

1161
00:31:59,018 --> 00:32:00,152
TO GET UP WITH HER EVERY SINGLE

1162
00:32:00,152 --> 00:32:01,253
TIME, ESPECIALLY SEEING HOW

1163
00:32:01,253 --> 00:32:02,488
YOU'RE THE ONE THAT'S BEEN DOING

1164
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:04,590
IT ANYWAYS.

1165
00:32:06,225 --> 00:32:11,297
* *

1166
00:32:11,297 --> 00:32:12,231
>> I'M NOT THRILLED TO BE

1167
00:32:12,231 --> 00:32:13,199
LEAVING MY HOUSE AND ALL THE

1168
00:32:13,199 --> 00:32:14,633
HELP FROM MY FAMILY, BUT IF

1169
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:15,701
MARIO'S GOING TO INSIST THAT

1170
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:17,736
KYLEE AND I LIVE WITH HIM,

1171
00:32:17,736 --> 00:32:18,937
HE NEEDS TO KNOW WHAT HE'S

1172
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,739
IN FOR.

1173
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:21,607
SHE POOP?

1174
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:22,641
>> YEAH.

1175
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:25,144
>> HA-HA.

1176
00:32:25,144 --> 00:32:27,146
>> SO NASTY.

1177
00:32:27,146 --> 00:32:31,883
[Kylee crying]

1178
00:32:31,883 --> 00:32:33,152
I'M NOT BEING VERY SUCCESSFUL

1179
00:32:33,152 --> 00:32:34,886
AT THIS.

1180
00:32:34,886 --> 00:32:35,988
>> YOU GOTTA--'CAUSE SHE'S

1181
00:32:35,988 --> 00:32:38,124
SMALL--YOU GOTTA FOLD THIS

1182
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:41,960
DOWN...AND THEN...

1183
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:53,039
>> [crying]

1184
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:55,507
>> SHH, SHH, SHH.

1185
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:56,542
CAN YOU, LIKE, MAKE HER,

1186
00:32:56,542 --> 00:32:58,044
LIKE, TWO OUNCES?

1187
00:32:58,044 --> 00:33:01,447
I THINK SHE'S STILL HUNGRY.

1188
00:33:01,447 --> 00:33:03,249
CAN YOU?

1189
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:08,587
OBVIOUSLY, IT DOESN'T MATTER

1190
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:11,457
WHERE WE SLEEP.

1191
00:33:11,457 --> 00:33:12,891
MARIO'S JUST NOT INTO HELPING ME

1192
00:33:12,891 --> 00:33:14,726
WITH THIS BABY.

1193
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:29,075
>> THINGS HAVE BEEN PRETTY TENSE

1194
00:33:29,075 --> 00:33:30,342
BETWEEN ME AND MARIO SINCE OUR

1195
00:33:30,342 --> 00:33:32,444
SLEEPOVER AT HIS HOUSE.

1196
00:33:32,444 --> 00:33:33,812
DESPITE THE TENSION, KYLEE AND I

1197
00:33:33,812 --> 00:33:37,483
HAVE GOTTEN INTO A NICE ROUTINE.

1198
00:33:37,483 --> 00:33:38,717
UNFORTUNATELY, THAT ROUTINE IS

1199
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:40,119
ABOUT TO CHANGE BECAUSE I'M

1200
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:41,753
GOING BACK TO SCHOOL.

1201
00:33:41,753 --> 00:33:43,122
AND SINCE MARIO IS SO UPTIGHT

1202
00:33:43,122 --> 00:33:44,456
ABOUT WHO WATCHES KYLEE,

1203
00:33:44,456 --> 00:33:45,391
WE HAD TO COME UP WITH A

1204
00:33:45,391 --> 00:33:46,725
BABYSITTING PLAN WE COULD BOTH

1205
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:48,360
AGREE ON, AND IT'S A LITTLE

1206
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,761
COMPLICATED.

1207
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:50,662
SHE PROBABLY NEEDS TO DO

1208
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:51,463
A LITTLE BURPING.

1209
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:52,764
>> GOOD LUCK, BABY GIRL.

1210
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:54,100
>> THANKS.

1211
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,101
>> ROB WILL WATCH HER ON

1212
00:33:55,101 --> 00:33:56,302
MONDAYS.

1213
00:33:56,302 --> 00:33:57,669
TUESDAY IS MARIO'S DAY OFF,

1214
00:33:57,669 --> 00:33:58,837
SO HE CAN KEEP HER.

1215
00:33:58,837 --> 00:34:00,038
DON'T WIPE UP.

1216
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,473
SHE GOES TO MARIO'S MOM

1217
00:34:01,473 --> 00:34:03,275
ON WEDNESDAYS, BACK TO MY MOM

1218
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:04,576
ON THURSDAYS...

1219
00:34:04,576 --> 00:34:06,812
SHE ALREADY ATE AND GOT CHANGED.

1220
00:34:06,812 --> 00:34:08,214
AND THEN OVER TO MARIO'S SISTER

1221
00:34:08,214 --> 00:34:10,449
ON FRIDAYS.

1222
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:11,850
I'M DETERMINED TO GRADUATE

1223
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,085
THIS YEAR, BUT I HATE BEING

1224
00:34:13,085 --> 00:34:14,820
AWAY FROM KYLEE FOR SO LONG,

1225
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,788
AND MARIO AND I RARELY SPEND

1226
00:34:16,788 --> 00:34:18,257
TIME TOGETHER ANYMORE.

1227
00:34:18,257 --> 00:34:20,392
>> THERE THE MOMMY IS.

1228
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:21,927
SO I AIN'T BEEN SEEING, LIKE,

1229
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:22,861
YOU AND MARIO HANGING OUT

1230
00:34:22,861 --> 00:34:23,662
TOO MUCH.

1231
00:34:23,662 --> 00:34:25,264
YOU GUYS PLAN ON DOING ANYTHING?

1232
00:34:25,264 --> 00:34:27,266
>> A DATE NIGHT?

1233
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:28,100
FAMILY DATE?

1234
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:29,201
I DON'T KNOW.

1235
00:34:29,201 --> 00:34:30,001
SOMETHING TONIGHT.

1236
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:30,969
>> A FAMILY DATE NIGHT?

1237
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:35,107
>> YEAH, 'CAUSE SHE'S GOING.

1238
00:34:35,107 --> 00:34:36,375
WE'RE BOTH REALLY TIRED,

1239
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:37,776
BUT MARIO HASN'T SPENT ANY TIME

1240
00:34:37,776 --> 00:34:39,411
WITH ME AND KYLEE THIS WEEK,

1241
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:40,546
AND I NEED TO LET HIM KNOW THAT

1242
00:34:40,546 --> 00:34:41,547
THIS ISN'T WORKING FOR ME

1243
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:43,349
ANYMORE.

1244
00:34:43,349 --> 00:34:44,383
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1245
00:34:44,383 --> 00:34:45,284
>> WHY DON'T YOU PUT HER

1246
00:34:45,284 --> 00:34:46,752
IN THE BOOTH?

1247
00:34:46,752 --> 00:34:49,621
>> [crying]

1248
00:34:49,621 --> 00:34:53,459
>> OH.

1249
00:34:53,459 --> 00:34:57,763
HORRIBLE.

1250
00:34:57,763 --> 00:35:02,868
WHAT'S WRONG?

1251
00:35:02,868 --> 00:35:04,336
WHAT'S SO COMICAL?

1252
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:05,837
>> YOU AND HER.

1253
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:07,206
JUST WATCHING.

1254
00:35:07,206 --> 00:35:09,541
>> MAYBE WE SHOULD TRADE PLACES

1255
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:11,210
SO I COULD LAUGH.

1256
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,244
>> WHY WOULD YOU LAUGH AT ME

1257
00:35:12,244 --> 00:35:13,044
AND I DEAL WITH HER

1258
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:14,513
ALL THE TIME?

1259
00:35:14,513 --> 00:35:16,248
>> MAINLY IT'S SOMEBODY ELSE,

1260
00:35:16,248 --> 00:35:18,284
ACTUALLY.

1261
00:35:18,284 --> 00:35:19,851
>> OH, MY GOD.

1262
00:35:19,851 --> 00:35:20,819
>> MAJORITY OF THE TIME,

1263
00:35:20,819 --> 00:35:23,789
SHE'S WITH SOMEBODY ELSE.

1264
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:33,532
>> I WASN'T EXPECTING THIS

1265
00:35:33,532 --> 00:35:35,301
TO BE EASIER THAN IT IS.

1266
00:35:35,301 --> 00:35:36,435
>> SO HOW DO YOU THINK

1267
00:35:36,435 --> 00:35:37,836
I FEEL?

1268
00:35:37,836 --> 00:35:40,071
LIKE, AFTER I, LIKE, COME HOME

1269
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:41,106
FROM, LIKE, SCHOOL

1270
00:35:41,106 --> 00:35:43,409
AND NOT GETTING ANY SLEEP.

1271
00:35:43,409 --> 00:35:45,344
>> I GUESS YOU FEEL TERRIBLE.

1272
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:46,912
>> AND TIRED AND WORN OUT

1273
00:35:46,912 --> 00:35:48,247
AND EXHAUSTED.

1274
00:35:48,247 --> 00:35:49,615
DON'T FEEL LIKE DOING NOTHING.

1275
00:35:49,615 --> 00:35:51,082
>> ALL OF THE ABOVE.

1276
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:52,017
>> OKAY.

1277
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:53,352
THEN, LIKE, WHY IS IT, LIKE,

1278
00:35:53,352 --> 00:35:54,853
WHEN I ASK YOU TO GET HER

1279
00:35:54,853 --> 00:35:56,087
OR SOMETHING OR SPEND THE NIGHT

1280
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:57,155
TO HELP ME, WHY IS IT, LIKE,

1281
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:57,989
SO HARD?

1282
00:35:57,989 --> 00:35:59,491
OR, LIKE, I HAVE TO BEG YOU.

1283
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:02,428
>> I WOULD RATHER GET HER

1284
00:36:02,428 --> 00:36:04,263
AND SPEND THE NIGHT AT MY HOUSE.

1285
00:36:04,263 --> 00:36:05,264
SOMETIMES FOR YOU TO CATCH UP

1286
00:36:05,264 --> 00:36:06,432
ON SLEEP, SHE HAS TO BE AWAY

1287
00:36:06,432 --> 00:36:07,433
FROM YOU.

1288
00:36:07,433 --> 00:36:08,367
>> I KNOW, BUT A MOM CAN'T

1289
00:36:08,367 --> 00:36:09,935
JUST BE LIKE, "HERE.

1290
00:36:09,935 --> 00:36:10,969
TAKE HER."

1291
00:36:10,969 --> 00:36:12,103
I CAN'T JUST LET HER GO

1292
00:36:12,103 --> 00:36:13,071
SOMEWHERE.

1293
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:14,573
>> YOU CAN'T LET HER GO

1294
00:36:14,573 --> 00:36:17,343
RIGHT ACROSS THE [bleep] STREET?

1295
00:36:17,343 --> 00:36:19,478
AT HER DAD'S HOUSE?

1296
00:36:19,478 --> 00:36:21,313
THAT'S BULL[bleep].

1297
00:36:21,313 --> 00:36:24,883
>> YEAH, IT'S SOOOO BULL[bleep].

1298
00:36:24,883 --> 00:36:25,584
>> WHAT?

1299
00:36:25,584 --> 00:36:26,318
>> I SAID YEAH,

1300
00:36:26,318 --> 00:36:27,419
IT'S SO BULL[bleep].

1301
00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:29,855
>> IT IS.

1302
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:31,189
BUT WHATEVER.

1303
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,691
I WON'T NEVER [bleep] ASK YOU

1304
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:33,592
TO COME SPEND THE NIGHT

1305
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:34,426
AT MY HOUSE.

1306
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:35,727
>> THAT'S SO [bleep] UP.

1307
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:37,263
>> SPEND THE NIGHT WHEN YOU

1308
00:36:37,263 --> 00:36:39,765
MOVE IN.

1309
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:42,868
[acoustic music]

1310
00:36:42,868 --> 00:36:49,275
* *

1311
00:37:01,387 --> 00:37:04,823
* *

1312
00:37:04,823 --> 00:37:06,191
>> WHEN I GOT HOME FROM DINNER

1313
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:07,393
WITH MARIO, IT WAS PRETTY

1314
00:37:07,393 --> 00:37:09,295
OBVIOUS THAT IT DIDN'T GO WELL.

1315
00:37:09,295 --> 00:37:10,061
>> HOW'D IT GO?

1316
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:10,762
>> HORRIBLE.

1317
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:12,964
>> SO WHAT HAPPENED?

1318
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:13,999
>> I JUST REALLY DON'T WANT TO

1319
00:37:13,999 --> 00:37:15,367
TALK ABOUT IT RIGHT NOW, MOM.

1320
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:16,635
>> WHEN YOU COME HOME UPSET,

1321
00:37:16,635 --> 00:37:17,603
YOU NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT.

1322
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:19,004
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

1323
00:37:19,004 --> 00:37:20,138
WHEN YOU LEFT HERE, EVERYTHING

1324
00:37:20,138 --> 00:37:21,273
WAS FINE.

1325
00:37:21,273 --> 00:37:22,274
>> JUST SEEMS LIKE HE DOESN'T

1326
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:23,575
CARE ABOUT ME ANYMORE

1327
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:24,876
OR NOTHING.

1328
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:26,244
>> A BABY CHANGES THINGS.

1329
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,679
A BABY CHANGES PEOPLE'S LIVES

1330
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:29,581
DRAMATICALLY.

1331
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,717
SO TOMORROW, WE NEED TO HAVE

1332
00:37:31,717 --> 00:37:34,486
A SERIOUS ADULT TALK

1333
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:38,123
AND LET HIM KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

1334
00:37:38,123 --> 00:37:39,157
>> I KNEW HAVING A BABY WOULD

1335
00:37:39,157 --> 00:37:40,926
CHANGE EVERYTHING, BUT I ALWAYS

1336
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:42,027
THOUGHT MARIO WOULD BE THERE

1337
00:37:42,027 --> 00:37:43,362
TO SUPPORT ME.

1338
00:37:43,362 --> 00:37:44,596
NOW THAT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE

1339
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:47,299
SUCH A SURE THING.

1340
00:37:52,203 --> 00:37:53,739
AFTER LAST NIGHT'S ARGUMENT,

1341
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:55,907
MY MOM INVITED MARIO AND HIS MOM

1342
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:57,776
OVER TO AIR THINGS OUT.

1343
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:58,877
>> CLEE-CLEE.

1344
00:37:58,877 --> 00:38:00,679
COME ON, BABY.

1345
00:38:02,481 --> 00:38:04,483
SO WHAT I NEED TO KNOW RIGHT NOW

1346
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:05,917
IS, WHAT'S THE TENSION ABOUT

1347
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:06,918
RIGHT NOW?

1348
00:38:06,918 --> 00:38:07,986
'CAUSE APPARENTLY Y'ALL GOT SOME

1349
00:38:07,986 --> 00:38:10,288
FEELINGS GOING ON RIGHT NOW

1350
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,190
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

1351
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,693
>> PRE-KYLEE, I MEAN, WERE THEY

1352
00:38:14,693 --> 00:38:16,261
NOT LOVEY DOVEY, HAPPY ALL THE

1353
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:17,363
TIME AND--

1354
00:38:17,363 --> 00:38:18,930
>> HE'S NOT CARING.

1355
00:38:18,930 --> 00:38:21,733
HE DON'T CARE ABOUT...

1356
00:38:21,733 --> 00:38:23,101
IT SEEMS LIKE HE DON'T CARE

1357
00:38:23,101 --> 00:38:24,436
ABOUT ANYTHING I DO.

1358
00:38:24,436 --> 00:38:26,137
I'LL ASK HIM TO--

1359
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,272
"CAN YOU COME OVER AND SPEND

1360
00:38:27,272 --> 00:38:28,139
THE NIGHT?"

1361
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:29,741
TO HELP ME WITH KYLEE.

1362
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:31,443
AND HE HAS, LIKE, THE HARDEST

1363
00:38:31,443 --> 00:38:32,611
TIME 'CAUSE HE'S SO TIRED

1364
00:38:32,611 --> 00:38:33,445
FROM WORK.

1365
00:38:33,445 --> 00:38:34,312
YOUR BACK DON'T HURT.

1366
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,180
YOUR FEET DON'T SWELL.

1367
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,147
YOUR BOOBS DON'T GET BIG.

1368
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,015
YOU'RE NOT CRAMPING

1369
00:38:37,015 --> 00:38:37,749
ALL THE TIME.

1370
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:38,750
NO ONE'S KICKING YOU IN YOUR

1371
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:39,685
RIBS OR HANGING FROM THEM

1372
00:38:39,685 --> 00:38:40,552
OR NOTHING LIKE THAT.

1373
00:38:40,552 --> 00:38:41,853
YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE 24/7.

1374
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:42,754
>> I KNOW ALL ABOUT IT.

1375
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:43,722
WHY DON'T YOU LET HER SPEND

1376
00:38:43,722 --> 00:38:44,756
THE NIGHT AT MY HOUSE SO YOU CAN

1377
00:38:44,756 --> 00:38:45,991
HAVE A DAY TO SLEEP?

1378
00:38:45,991 --> 00:38:46,825
>> LET ME INTERJECT.

1379
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:47,759
I'M GONNA HAVE TO SAY THIS

1380
00:38:47,759 --> 00:38:48,627
IN HER DEFENSE, HONEY.

1381
00:38:48,627 --> 00:38:49,495
AS A MOTHER AT NIGHT,

1382
00:38:49,495 --> 00:38:50,462
IT'S DIFFERENT FOR CLEONDRA

1383
00:38:50,462 --> 00:38:51,663
TO LEAVE HER DURING THE DAY.

1384
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,432
BUT AT NIGHT, YOU EXPECT YOUR

1385
00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:55,000
LITTLE--ALL YOUR CHICKENS TO BE

1386
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,967
IN THEIR NEST AT NIGHT.

1387
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:57,936
IF YOU AGREED TO SPEND,

1388
00:38:57,936 --> 00:38:59,771
YOU KNOW, A NIGHT HERE

1389
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:00,706
ONE OR TWO NIGHTS A WEEK,

1390
00:39:00,706 --> 00:39:01,707
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU

1391
00:39:01,707 --> 00:39:03,609
THINK YOU CAN HANDLE, MARIO?

1392
00:39:03,609 --> 00:39:04,610
>> YEAH.

1393
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:05,877
>> OKAY, SEE?

1394
00:39:05,877 --> 00:39:06,712
NOW, LOOK.

1395
00:39:06,712 --> 00:39:08,079
THIS IS WHAT YOU DO WHEN YOU

1396
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:09,114
LOVE EACH OTHER.

1397
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:10,782
>> IF YOU CAN'T COMPROMISE NOW,

1398
00:39:10,782 --> 00:39:11,750
YOU DAMN SURE AIN'T GONNA BE

1399
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:12,718
ABLE TO COMPROMISE TOGETHER

1400
00:39:12,718 --> 00:39:13,652
LIVING IN THE SAME HOUSE.

1401
00:39:13,652 --> 00:39:14,285
>> RIGHT.

1402
00:39:14,285 --> 00:39:15,320
>> I MEAN, BECAUSE BEFORE KYLEE,

1403
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:16,287
WE WERE LIKE ALWAYS BY EACH

1404
00:39:16,287 --> 00:39:18,289
OTHER.

1405
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:19,491
>> I MEAN, IF YOU GUYS ARE

1406
00:39:19,491 --> 00:39:20,959
REALLY WANTING TO STAY TOGETHER

1407
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:22,461
AND WORK AT IT,

1408
00:39:22,461 --> 00:39:27,165
YOU GOT TO DO IT.

1409
00:39:27,165 --> 00:39:28,233
>> WE'LL WORK ON THAT.

1410
00:39:28,233 --> 00:39:34,005
>> * WHEN I COME HOME *

1411
00:39:34,005 --> 00:39:38,544
* PLEASE DON'T TURN ME AWAY *

1412
00:39:38,544 --> 00:39:40,479
>> MARIO, HE'S CHANGED A LOT.

1413
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:41,613
HE'S JUST A NEW DAD.

1414
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:42,714
HE'S JUST STILL HAVING TO GROW

1415
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:43,715
ON SOME FEW THINGS.

1416
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:45,250
I MEAN, I LOVE HIM SO MUCH.

1417
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:46,552
HE'S MY FIRST, LIKE,

1418
00:39:46,552 --> 00:39:49,320
REAL RELATIONSHIP.

1419
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:50,255
HE ACTS LIKE HE'S GETTING

1420
00:39:50,255 --> 00:39:51,623
MARRIED AND LIVING IN A HOUSE

1421
00:39:51,623 --> 00:39:52,991
TOGETHER.

1422
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:54,392
WHEN'S IT GONNA BE FINISHED?

1423
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:55,326
>> LIKE A WEEK AND A HALF,

1424
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:56,194
TWO WEEKS.

1425
00:39:56,194 --> 00:39:57,128
>> HE'S EVERYTHING I COULD

1426
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:58,096
BASICALLY ASK FOR.

1427
00:39:58,096 --> 00:39:58,997
I DON'T ASK FOR MUCH,

1428
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:00,966
AND WHAT HE HAS IS JUST

1429
00:40:00,966 --> 00:40:02,434
WHAT I NEED, SO...

1430
00:40:02,434 --> 00:40:03,469
WELL, ZYRA IS GOING TO COME OVER

1431
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:04,670
AND VISIT.

1432
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,204
MAYBE SPEND THE NIGHT.

1433
00:40:06,204 --> 00:40:08,373
>> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT ALL THAT.

1434
00:40:08,373 --> 00:40:09,508
>> WHATEVER.

1435
00:40:09,508 --> 00:40:11,109
IF I MOVE OVER TO MARIO'S HOUSE,

1436
00:40:11,109 --> 00:40:12,544
I THINK ZYRA'S GOING TO MISS ME

1437
00:40:12,544 --> 00:40:13,378
A LOT.

1438
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:14,880
YOU WANT CLEE-CLEE TO LEAVE?

1439
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,681
>> NOPE.

1440
00:40:15,681 --> 00:40:16,515
>> I'M GONNA MOVE IN

1441
00:40:16,515 --> 00:40:19,618
WITH MARIO.

1442
00:40:19,618 --> 00:40:21,052
[laughs]

1443
00:40:21,052 --> 00:40:22,387
MY LIFE AS A TEEN MOM IS

1444
00:40:22,387 --> 00:40:23,722
PRETTY HECTIC.

1445
00:40:23,722 --> 00:40:25,223
I GO TO SCHOOL AND I RAISE

1446
00:40:25,223 --> 00:40:26,825
MY LITTLE GIRL.

1447
00:40:26,825 --> 00:40:28,660
MOST OF TEENAGERS, THEY WANT TO

1448
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,896
LIVE THEIR TEENAGE YEARS,

1449
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:32,163
HAVE FUN.

1450
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:34,299
AND I MEAN, ONCE YOU HAVE A KID,

1451
00:40:34,299 --> 00:40:35,934
ALL THAT GOES OUT THE WINDOW.

1452
00:40:35,934 --> 00:40:38,937
IT'S YOUR KID FIRST, THEN YOU.

1453
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:41,172
IT'S YOUR JOB AND SCHOOL FIRST.

1454
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:42,741
BUT I'M WILLING TO DO IT

1455
00:40:42,741 --> 00:40:46,077
FOR MY OWN CHILD.

1456
00:40:46,077 --> 00:40:47,345
I MEAN, I HAVE NO REGRETS

1457
00:40:47,345 --> 00:40:48,480
WHATSOEVER 'CAUSE I'M MAKING

1458
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,648
THE BEST OUT OF MY LIFE,

1459
00:40:49,648 --> 00:40:50,582
AND MY LIFE IS GOING TO BE

1460
00:40:50,582 --> 00:40:52,117
AWESOME.

1461
00:41:06,598 --> 00:41:08,099
>> ON THE NEXT 16 AND PREGNANT: 

1462
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:09,134
WHEN I WAS 13, I WAS

1463
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:10,869
HOSPITALIZED FOR ANOREXIA.

1464
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:12,437
IT'S SO HARD FOR ME BEING

1465
00:41:12,437 --> 00:41:13,839
PREGNANT AND GAINING ALL THIS

1466
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:14,506
WEIGHT.

1467
00:41:14,506 --> 00:41:15,306
>> YOU'RE NOT FAT.

1468
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:16,074
YOU'RE PREGNANT.

1469
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:16,875
>> KIND OF FLABBY.

1470
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:18,043
I FEEL REALLY LIGHTHEADED.

1471
00:41:18,043 --> 00:41:18,877
>> DO YOU NEED FOOD?

1472
00:41:18,877 --> 00:41:20,178
>> NO, I'M SERIOUSLY SCARED.

1473
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:23,381
>> A LOT OF PRESSURE HERE.

1474
00:41:26,084 --> 00:41:27,052
YOU WANT ME TO GO ON A DIET

1475
00:41:27,052 --> 00:41:27,686
WITH YOU?

1476
00:41:27,686 --> 00:41:28,554
>> JUST START WATCHING

1477
00:41:28,554 --> 00:41:30,355
WHAT WE'RE EATING.

1478
00:41:30,355 --> 00:41:31,289
>> YOU WERE, LIKE, MY BEST

1479
00:41:31,289 --> 00:41:32,423
FRIEND BEFORE I GOT PREGNANT,

1480
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:33,491
AND NOW I FEEL LIKE YOU CAN'T

1481
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,293
EVEN STAND TO BE AROUND ME.
