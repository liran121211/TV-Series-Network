1
00:00:02,936 --> 00:00:04,372
>> OHHH.

2
00:00:04,372 --> 00:00:05,773
HI, I'M ALLIE.

3
00:00:05,773 --> 00:00:07,808
I'M 16 YEARS OLD.

4
00:00:07,808 --> 00:00:09,110
I JUST STARTED MY SENIOR YEAR OF

5
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:10,878
HIGH SCHOOL, AND I'M SO READY TO

6
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:12,380
MAKE THE MOST OF MY LAST YEAR

7
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,347
BEFORE I GRADUATE.

8
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:15,083
SENIOR IS KIND OF BRUTAL,

9
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:17,017
BUT, LIKE, I LIKE IT.

10
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:19,053
I LIVE IN PASADENA, TEXAS,

11
00:00:19,053 --> 00:00:20,020
BUT I'M NO TEXAN.

12
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,489
I HATE TEXAS.

13
00:00:21,489 --> 00:00:23,057
TWO YEARS AGO, WHEN MY DAD

14
00:00:23,057 --> 00:00:24,592
MOVE FROM NEW JERSEY TO TEXAS,

15
00:00:24,592 --> 00:00:26,360
I HAD TO GO WITH HIM, BECAUSE AT

16
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,362
THE TIME, MY MOM COULDN'T AFFORD

17
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:29,997
TO HAVE ME STAY WITH HER.

18
00:00:29,997 --> 00:00:31,799
LEAVING MY MOM BEHIND WAS HARD,

19
00:00:31,799 --> 00:00:33,167
BUT AT LEAST WE TALK ALL THE

20
00:00:33,167 --> 00:00:33,967
TIME.

21
00:00:33,967 --> 00:00:35,436
>> HI.

22
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:36,804
I'VE MADE A FEW NEW FRIENDS

23
00:00:36,804 --> 00:00:38,572
HERE, AND SINCE I STARTED DATING

24
00:00:38,572 --> 00:00:40,608
MY BOYFRIEND JOEY, TEXAS HAS

25
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:44,945
GOTTEN A LITTLE BETTER.

26
00:00:44,945 --> 00:00:46,580
HE'S ONLY A SOPHOMORE, BUT HE'S

27
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,015
ON THE FOOTBALL TEAM, SO I CAN

28
00:00:48,015 --> 00:00:49,417
OVERLOOK THAT ONE SMALL FLAW.

29
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:51,119
GO, JOEY.

30
00:00:51,119 --> 00:00:52,620
WE GOOF AROUND AND HAVE A LOT OF

31
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:53,987
FUN TOGETHER, BUT THINGS ARE

32
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:55,055
ABOUT TO GET SERIOUS, BECAUSE

33
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,857
I'M PREGNANT.

DATING A SOPHOMORE, BUT NOW THAT

00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:07,301
I'M FIVE MONTHS PREGNANT,

00:01:07,301 --> 00:01:09,503
ALL ANYONE NOTICES IS MY BELLY.

40
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:10,638
>> I REMEMBER WHEN YOU FIRST

41
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:11,905
HANDED ME THAT PREGNANCY TEST.

42
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,941
IT CAME OUT POSITIVE.

43
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:14,942
I WAS, LIKE, SO SHOCKED.

44
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:16,644
WE WERE, LIKE, GOING OUT FOR,

45
00:01:16,644 --> 00:01:17,611
LIKE, A MONTH OR TWO.

46
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:18,546
>> LIKE, TWO MONTHS.

47
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:19,780
WELL, WHEN WE FOUND OUT, IT WAS,

48
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,048
LIKE, THREE MONTHS, 'CAUSE WE

49
00:01:21,048 --> 00:01:21,915
DIDN'T KNOW AT FIRST.

50
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,252
I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD HAPPEN,

51
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:26,387
'CAUSE I WAS ON THE PILL OR

52
00:01:26,387 --> 00:01:28,556
WHATEVER, AND I MISSED A

53
00:01:28,556 --> 00:01:29,557
COUPLE OF DAYS, BUT IT'S NOT

54
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:32,393
LIKE YOU ASK, LIKE, WHEN YOU'RE

55
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:33,794
IN THAT MOMENT, NO ONE STOPS

56
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:35,829
AND--WELL, NOW I'M GONNA STOP

57
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:37,265
AND THINK, BUT, LIKE, IT'S NOT

58
00:01:37,265 --> 00:01:38,299
LIKE YOU ASK, "HEY, DID YOU MISS

59
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:39,300
YOUR PILL TODAY?"

60
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:40,368
>> YEAH, YOU DON'T THINK THAT.

61
00:01:40,368 --> 00:01:41,669
>> YEAH, BECAUSE THEN THE

62
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:42,770
MOOD'S JUST, LIKE, PBBT AFTER

63
00:01:42,770 --> 00:01:43,904
THAT.

64
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:44,972
SO MANY PEOPLE IN SCHOOL ASKED

65
00:01:44,972 --> 00:01:46,274
ME, LIKE, THEY'RE LIKE, "OH,

66
00:01:46,274 --> 00:01:47,241
SINCE YOU GUYS ARE HAVING A

67
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:48,342
BABY, ARE YOU GETTING MARRIED?"

00:01:48,342 --> 00:01:49,877
LIKE, IS THAT, LIKE, A RULE,

69
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:50,878
IF YOU HAVE A KID YOU HAVE TO

70
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:51,612
GET MARRIED?

71
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:52,546
I WAS LIKE, "NO."

72
00:01:52,546 --> 00:01:53,481
I'D RATHER YOU WANT TO GET

73
00:01:53,481 --> 00:01:54,482
MARRIED, LIKE, 'CAUSE WE LOVE

74
00:01:54,482 --> 00:01:55,149
EACH OTHER.

75
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:56,384
>> I JUST FEEL LIKE I DON'T WANT

76
00:01:56,384 --> 00:01:57,985
TO RUSH INTO THINGS, LIKE,

77
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:58,719
GIVE IT TIME.

78
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,720
>> WELL, DON'T YOU THINK WE'RE

79
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,655
RUSHING INTO THINGS NOW?

80
00:02:01,655 --> 00:02:03,391
>> YES, BUT THE MARRIAGE--

81
00:02:03,391 --> 00:02:05,426
>> YEAH, THAT'S A CHOICE.

82
00:02:05,426 --> 00:02:07,395
ARE YOU SCARED?

83
00:02:07,395 --> 00:02:09,697
>> YES, I'M SCARED.

84
00:02:09,697 --> 00:02:10,698
>> I'M SCARED.

85
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:12,500
[laughs]

86
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,571
NONE OF MY FRIENDS ARE IN ANY OF

87
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:19,039
MY CLASSES THIS SEMESTER.

88
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,007
LET ME GET THE DOOR FOR YOU

89
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:20,708
LADIES.

90
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:21,975
>> OH, THANK YOU.

91
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,076
>> AND NOW THAT I'M STARTING TO

92
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:24,212
SHOW, THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW IT'S

93
00:02:24,212 --> 00:02:25,213
GOING.

94
00:02:25,213 --> 00:02:26,180
>> LIKE, HOW DOES IT FEEL IN

95
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,481
SCHOOL, LIKE, YOU KNOW,

96
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:28,682
HOW YOU HAVE A BIG BELLY?

97
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:29,883
LIKE, IS EVERYONE ALWAYS

98
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:30,551
STARING?

99
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:31,619
LIKE, DO THEY TALK ABOUT YOU AND

100
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:32,286
STUFF?

101
00:02:32,286 --> 00:02:32,953
>> YEAH.

102
00:02:32,953 --> 00:02:33,987
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW IF PEOPLE

103
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,123
TALK ABOUT ME, BUT PEOPLE STARE.

104
00:02:36,123 --> 00:02:37,258
GIRLS WHO STARE LIKE THAT, I'M

105
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:38,192
LIKE...

106
00:02:38,192 --> 00:02:39,193
>> [laughs]

107
00:02:39,193 --> 00:02:40,160
>> DOING THE EYEBROW THING.

108
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,161
>> YEAH, I LOOK AT THEM LIKE,

109
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:41,995
"HELLO."

110
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:43,096
>> BUT YOURS DOESN'T LOOK THAT

111
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:43,764
BIG--

112
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:44,465
>> EXACTLY.

113
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:45,566
THAT'S WHY PEOPLE ARE LIKE, "IS

114
00:02:45,566 --> 00:02:47,235
SHE OR IS SHE NOT?"

115
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:48,336
>> I TOLD MY MOM, AND MY MOM WAS

116
00:02:48,336 --> 00:02:49,303
LIKE, "OH, GET AN ABORTION,"

117
00:02:49,303 --> 00:02:49,970
RIGHT AWAY.

118
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:50,738
>> WHAT?

119
00:02:50,738 --> 00:02:51,905
>> AND THEN I TOLD MY DAD,

120
00:02:51,905 --> 00:02:52,940
AND THEN MY DAD DIDN'T TALK TO

121
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:54,041
ME FOR, LIKE, A WEEK, AND AFTER

122
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,042
A WEEK, HE WAS LIKE, "YOU GET

123
00:02:55,042 --> 00:02:55,876
ADOPTION OR GET OUT."

124
00:02:55,876 --> 00:02:56,644
>> THAT'S CRAZY.

125
00:02:56,644 --> 00:02:57,745
WHY WOULD YOUR PARENTS KICK YOU

126
00:02:57,745 --> 00:02:58,679
OUT WHEN YOU'RE PREGNANT?

127
00:02:58,679 --> 00:02:59,647
>> I WOULD NEVER KICK OUT MY

128
00:02:59,647 --> 00:03:00,214
KID.

129
00:03:00,214 --> 00:03:00,881
>> EXACTLY.

130
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:01,915
>> LIKE, I CAN'T GO TO MY MOM'S.

131
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,016
IF I GO TO MY MOM'S HOUSE, THEN

132
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,352
ME AND JOEY ARE NOT TOGETHER,

133
00:03:04,352 --> 00:03:05,853
'CAUSE SHE'S IN NEW JERSEY.

134
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:06,587
YEAH.

135
00:03:06,587 --> 00:03:07,688
>> HOW DOES JOEY FEEL ABOUT ALL

136
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,290
THIS, LIKE, BEING A DAD?

137
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,258
>> HE SAID HE'S READY NOW.

138
00:03:10,258 --> 00:03:11,259
IF YOU ASK HIM, "ARE YOU READY

139
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:12,025
TO BE A PARENT?"

140
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:12,926
"YEAH, I'M READY TO BE A

141
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:13,561
PARENT."

142
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:14,962
IT'S LIKE, "NO, YOU'RE NOT."

143
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:16,530
[laughter]

144
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,931
JOEY ISN'T READY FOR A LOT OF

145
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:19,800
THINGS, AND NEITHER AM I.

146
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,302
WE DEFINITELY AREN'T READY TO

147
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:22,603
LIVE TOGETHER WITH JOEY'S

148
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:23,971
PARENTS, BUT THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE

149
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:25,773
TO DO, BECAUSE AFTER I TOLD MY

150
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:26,974
DAD I WAS PREGNANT, I HAD TO

151
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:28,041
MOVE OUT.

152
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,343
IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME THAT MY

153
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:31,279
BABY HAS BOTH PARENTS, SO GOING

154
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:33,046
TO MY MOM'S IN NEW JERSEY WASN'T

155
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:34,348
AN OPTION.

156
00:03:34,348 --> 00:03:35,716
MY ONLY CHOICE IS TO LIVE WITH

157
00:03:35,716 --> 00:03:37,117
JOEY'S PARENTS, WHICH MAKES ME

158
00:03:37,117 --> 00:03:38,386
VERY UNCOMFORTABLE,

159
00:03:38,386 --> 00:03:40,220
ESPECIALLY SINCE I CAN TELL

160
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,689
JOEY'S MOM REALLY DOESN'T WANT

161
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:42,456
ME TO BE THERE.

162
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,658
>> I MET HER ONE DAY, AND THEN

163
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:46,193
THE NEXT TIME WAS, "SHE'S

164
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:46,894
PREGNANT."

165
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:48,529
I MEAN, RIGHT THERE WE WENT.

166
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:50,030
>> HOW'D YOU FEEL WHEN I TEXTED

167
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:51,832
YOU SAYING ALLISON WAS PREGNANT?

168
00:03:51,832 --> 00:03:53,867
>> I WAS LIKE, "OH, NO.

169
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:54,902
WHAT THE HECK IS WRONG WITH

170
00:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,004
JOEY?"

171
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:58,272
WHAT DID YOU FRIENDS THINK,

172
00:03:58,272 --> 00:03:59,006
JOEY?

173
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:00,240
>> THEY THOUGHT I WAS JOKING.

174
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,041
>> MM-MM.

175
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,009
>> EVERYBODY WAS SAYING I'M

176
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:03,076
SCREWED.

177
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,077
>> YOU'RE SCREWED?

178
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:04,912
IT'S NOT THAT HARD.

179
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,447
I TOOK CARE OF A BABY, WENT TO

180
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:09,650
SCHOOL, HELPED HER, AND WORKED.

181
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,151
IT SUCKS.

182
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:12,453
>> ABORTION OR ADOPTION,

183
00:04:12,453 --> 00:04:13,387
IS THAT AN OPTION?

184
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:14,655
DID Y'ALL EVER THINK ABOUT IT?

185
00:04:14,655 --> 00:04:15,323
>> NOPE.

186
00:04:15,323 --> 00:04:16,324
>> DIDN'T?

187
00:04:16,324 --> 00:04:18,158
>> NEVER.

188
00:04:18,158 --> 00:04:19,126
>> I DON'T REALLY BELIEVE IN

189
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:19,693
THAT.

190
00:04:19,693 --> 00:04:21,028
>> MY MOM AND DAD DO.

191
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:22,195
>> WHAT ARE Y'ALL GONNA DO AFTER

192
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:22,963
THE BABY'S BORN?

193
00:04:22,963 --> 00:04:24,332
WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS?

194
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:25,366
>> LIKE, WITH WHAT?

195
00:04:25,366 --> 00:04:26,500
>> WHERE ARE Y'ALL GONNA BE

196
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,302
STAYING AT?

197
00:04:34,141 --> 00:04:35,142
>> HOPEFULLY, EVERYTHING GOES

198
00:04:35,142 --> 00:04:36,577
GOOD.

199
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:37,845
>> WHEN I MOVED IN TWO MONTHS

200
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:39,380
AGO, JOEY WARNED ME THAT

201
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,914
HIS MOM HAS STRUGGLED WITH DRUGS

202
00:04:40,914 --> 00:04:42,416
FOR A LONG TIME,

203
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:43,717
WHICH MEANS WE NEVER KNOW WHAT

204
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:48,556
SHE'S GOING TO SAY OR DO.

205
00:04:48,556 --> 00:04:50,057
>> COME INSIDE.

206
00:04:50,057 --> 00:04:52,192
DAMIEN, GET IN.

207
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:53,093
I TOLD YOU.

208
00:04:53,093 --> 00:04:54,127
I DONE TOLD YOU I DIDN'T WANT TO

209
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,128
SEE HIM.

210
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:56,597
I KNEW THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

211
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:59,667
I NEED A FIX.

212
00:04:59,667 --> 00:05:00,668
>> JOEY AND I SPEND A LOT OF

213
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:01,735
TIME WISHING WE HAD OTHER

214
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:02,403
OPTIONS.

215
00:05:02,403 --> 00:05:03,103
>> SLOW DOWN.

216
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:04,037
I'M FAT AND PREGNANT.

217
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:04,938
>> [laughs]

218
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:07,207
>> I KNOW IT'S YOUR MOM, BUT SHE

219
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:10,478
KIND OF DOES AFFECT THE BABY.

220
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:11,512
I DON'T KNOW.

221
00:05:11,512 --> 00:05:14,281
WHAT IS SHE'S, LIKE, NOT CLEAN

222
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:15,549
AROUND HIM OR SOMETHING,

223
00:05:15,549 --> 00:05:17,050
HOWEVER YOU SAY THAT?

224
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:17,885
>> YEAH.

225
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:18,986
>> 'CAUSE YOU KNOW HOW SHE GETS

226
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:19,720
ANGRY?

227
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:20,854
WHAT IF SHE DOES SOMETHING AND

228
00:05:20,854 --> 00:05:21,822
HURTS HIM?

229
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,124
>> YEAH, SHE GETS ANGRY EASILY.

230
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,192
>> YEAH.

231
00:05:25,192 --> 00:05:26,159
I DON'T WANT HIM IN A PLACE

232
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,728
THAT'S NOT SAFE FOR HIM.

233
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:28,962
I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE.

234
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:30,498
I'D RATHER BE IN PASADENA

235
00:05:30,498 --> 00:05:31,298
WITH YOUR GRANDMA.

236
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:32,400
>> YEAH, IT'S MUCH MORE SAFER IN

237
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,367
PASADENA.

238
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:35,569
[sighs]

239
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:37,805
>> PASADENA IS ONLY 20 MINUTES

240
00:05:37,805 --> 00:05:39,540
AWAY, AND WE'D LIKE TO LIVE WITH

241
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:40,741
JOEY'S GRANDMA,

242
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:42,242
BUT SHE FEELS THERE ISN'T ENOUGH

243
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:43,276
ROOM FOR ALL OF US.

244
00:05:43,276 --> 00:05:44,978
STILL, IT'S GOOD TO GO OVER

245
00:05:44,978 --> 00:05:46,013
THERE JUST TO VENT.

246
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,347
I'M GONNA FAIL HIGH SCHOOL.

247
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,516
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA GRADUATE IF

248
00:05:48,516 --> 00:05:49,316
WE STAY OVER THERE.

249
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:50,317
THERE'S PEOPLE COMING IN AND

250
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:51,419
OUT, LIKE, 1:00 IN THE MORNING,

251
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:52,453
LIKE, 2:00 IN THE MORNING, LIKE,

252
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:53,587
AND THEY'RE ALL--CONSTANT

253
00:05:53,587 --> 00:05:54,254
YELLING.

254
00:05:54,254 --> 00:05:55,355
>> SHE YELLS ALL THE TIME.

255
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,324
>> THEY BOTH YELL, AND THEN WHEN

256
00:05:57,324 --> 00:05:58,692
SHE GOES TO BED, THE WHOLE HOUSE

257
00:05:58,692 --> 00:05:59,860
HAS TO SHUT UP, OR SHE'LL HAVE A

258
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:00,661
FIT.

259
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:01,462
>> WHAT?

260
00:06:01,462 --> 00:06:02,463
>> JOEY COULD HAVE THE TV UP A

261
00:06:02,463 --> 00:06:03,063
LITTLE.

262
00:06:03,063 --> 00:06:04,197
SHE'LL TEXT JOEY, "TURN DOWN

263
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,198
THAT F-ING TV, BLAH, BLAH,

264
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:05,899
BLAH."

265
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,935
LIKE, IT'S JUST NOT GOOD.

266
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:08,702
>> YEAH.

267
00:06:08,702 --> 00:06:09,670
>> SHE'S ALWAYS TALKING BAD

268
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,370
ABOUT MY DAD.

269
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,805
LIKE, "OH, YOUR DAD DOESN'T DO

270
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:13,507
NOTHING FOR Y'ALL, BLAH, BLAH,

271
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:15,008
BLAH," AND I'M LIKE, "NEITHER

272
00:06:15,008 --> 00:06:15,909
DO YOU."

273
00:06:15,909 --> 00:06:16,944
>> DRUGS HAVE REALLY JUST MESSED

274
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:17,978
UP HER MIND.

275
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:18,946
SHE STILL DOESN'T UNDERSTAND

276
00:06:18,946 --> 00:06:20,448
WHAT IT TAKES TO BE A PARENT.

277
00:06:20,448 --> 00:06:21,882
YOU THINK THAT $5 HERE AND A

278
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,051
HAMBURGER IS A PARENT?

279
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:25,052
IT'S NOT EASY, YOU BRING A

280
00:06:25,052 --> 00:06:27,287
BABY IN THE WORLD.

281
00:06:27,287 --> 00:06:28,522
IT'S NOT EASY AT ALL.

282
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:30,057
>> IT'S NOT EASY, BUT HIS

283
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:31,058
PARENTS DO THIS LITTLE EXTRA

284
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:32,660
STRESSING.

285
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,727
WHILE JOEY'S GRANDMA HASN'T

286
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:35,563
OFFERED TO TAKE US IN, SHE IS

287
00:06:35,563 --> 00:06:36,897
TRYING TO HELP US BY BRINGING

288
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,466
EVERYONE TOGETHER AT HER PLACE

289
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:39,900
TO DISCUSS A PLAN FOR WHEN THE

290
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,901
BABY COMES.

291
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:41,902
>> HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO SCHOOL

292
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:42,803
WHEN YOU HAVE THE BABY?

293
00:06:42,803 --> 00:06:43,804
ARE YOU GONNA BE HOMEBOUND OR

294
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:44,371
WHAT?

295
00:06:44,371 --> 00:06:45,072
>> DAY CARE.

296
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,106
>> THAT BABY IS NOT GOING TO DAY

297
00:06:46,106 --> 00:06:46,674
CARE.

298
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:47,775
>> WELL, THEN, WHO'S GONNA TAKE

299
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:48,408
CARE HER?

300
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:49,109
WE ALL WORK.

301
00:06:49,109 --> 00:06:50,143
>> WELL, MY FRIEND WAS TELLING

302
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,645
ME ABOUT THIS PLACE THAT SHE PUT

303
00:06:51,645 --> 00:06:53,246
HER BABY WHEN IT WAS BORN.

304
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,948
IT WAS, LIKE, ONE MONTH, AND IT

305
00:06:54,948 --> 00:06:55,883
WAS RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO OUR

306
00:06:55,883 --> 00:06:56,550
SCHOOL.

307
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,284
>> OH, REALLY?

308
00:06:57,284 --> 00:06:57,918
>> YEAH.

309
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:58,752
>> IT'S A DAY CARE?

310
00:06:58,752 --> 00:06:59,853
>> YEAH, SHE GETS IT THERE FOR

311
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,121
FREE, 'CAUSE HER AND HER

312
00:07:01,121 --> 00:07:02,155
BOYFRIEND ARE BOTH IN SCHOOL.

313
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,658
>> YOU TRUST DAY CARES?

314
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:05,559
YOU TRUST DAY CARES?

315
00:07:05,559 --> 00:07:06,527
>> WELL, THERE ARE GOOD DAY

316
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:07,127
CARES.

317
00:07:07,127 --> 00:07:08,061
THERE ARE GOOD DAY CARES.

318
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:09,196
>> MOTHER, YOU DIDN'T EVEN LIKE

319
00:07:09,196 --> 00:07:10,363
ME TO PUT MY KIDS IN DAY CARE,

320
00:07:10,363 --> 00:07:11,298
SO DON'T EVEN TRY IT.

321
00:07:11,298 --> 00:07:11,999
>> WHO?

322
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:12,666
>> YOU.

323
00:07:12,666 --> 00:07:13,667
>> 'CAUSE AT THAT TIME, IT WAS

324
00:07:13,667 --> 00:07:14,234
BAD.

325
00:07:14,234 --> 00:07:15,102
THINGS ARE DIFFERENT.

326
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:16,470
NOW THEY HAVE CAMERAS.

327
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,471
WELL, THAT'S THE ONLY OPTION

328
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:18,138
THEY HAVE.

329
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:19,072
>> WHAT ABOUT YOUR DAD?

330
00:07:19,072 --> 00:07:20,173
IS HE GONNA HELP YOU OUT IN ANY

331
00:07:20,173 --> 00:07:20,741
WAY?

332
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:21,642
>> WHAT, WITH THE BABY?

333
00:07:21,642 --> 00:07:22,676
YEAH, HE SAID HE WOULD.

334
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:24,111
NOW HE'S STARTING TO COME

335
00:07:24,111 --> 00:07:24,812
AROUND.

336
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:25,913
>> IT REALLY JUST PISSED ME OFF

337
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:26,914
WHEN HER DAD WAS LIKE, "WELL,

338
00:07:26,914 --> 00:07:27,781
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

339
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:28,682
WHERE ARE YOU GONNA GO?

340
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:29,783
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO LIVE UNDER

341
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:30,751
THE BRIDGE SOMEWHERE, 'CAUSE

342
00:07:30,751 --> 00:07:31,719
YOU'RE NOT LIVING WITH ME."

343
00:07:31,719 --> 00:07:32,385
>> OH, NO.

344
00:07:32,385 --> 00:07:33,386
>> HE DID THROW YOU OUT OF THE

345
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:33,987
HOUSE.

346
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:34,988
HE TOLD YOU YOU HAVE TO LEAVE.

347
00:07:34,988 --> 00:07:36,023
I DIDN'T GET RID OF HER WHEN SHE

348
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:36,824
CAME OUT PREGNANT.

349
00:07:36,824 --> 00:07:37,758
"OH, GET OUT OF THE HOUSE.

350
00:07:37,758 --> 00:07:38,659
YOU NEED TO LEAVE NOW."

351
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:39,459
THAT'S MY DAUGHTER.

352
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:40,861
REGARDLESS, THAT'S MY DAUGHTER.

353
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:41,929
WE TAKE CARE OF OUR OWN.

354
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:42,596
I'M SORRY.

355
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:43,964
>> YEAH, WE DO.

356
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:44,665
WE DO.

357
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:45,933
>> I DON'T LIKE WHEN YOUSE ALL

358
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:47,835
TALK ABOUT HIM BAD, BUT HE DID

359
00:07:47,835 --> 00:07:52,139
DO THAT BAD, SO I JUST TAKE IT.

360
00:07:52,139 --> 00:07:53,006
>> HE'S MY DAD.

361
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:54,274
>> WELL, YEAH, THAT'S--I MEAN,

362
00:07:54,274 --> 00:07:55,976
I UNDERSTAND THAT, BECAUSE YOU

363
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,678
DON'T HAVE NOBODY HERE.

364
00:07:57,678 --> 00:07:59,079
YOU'RE ALONE HERE.

365
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:01,014
THE THING ABOUT IT IS THAT Y'ALL

366
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,583
ARE GONNA FINISH SCHOOL.

367
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,651
Y'ALL ARE GONNA GO OUT AND GET A

368
00:08:03,651 --> 00:08:04,718
CAREER, AND THAT'S THE BEST

369
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:09,723
THING THAT Y'ALL CAN DO.

370
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:11,024
>> I WANT TO STAY TO RAISE THE

371
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:12,726
BABY WITH JOEY, BUT I'M NOT SURE

372
00:08:12,726 --> 00:08:13,927
HIS MOM'S HOUSE IS THE BEST

373
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:16,697
PLACE TO DO IT.

374
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:22,836
>> HELLO.

375
00:08:22,836 --> 00:08:23,671
>> HI.

376
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:25,272
I'M 6 1/2 MONTHS PREGNANT, AND

377
00:08:25,272 --> 00:08:26,740
WITH ALL THE STRESS OF LIVING AT

378
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,475
JOEY'S, I CAN'T WAIT FOR PHONE

379
00:08:28,475 --> 00:08:29,643
CALLS WITH MY MOM.

380
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:34,648
>> WHEN ARE YOU GONNA COME?

381
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:35,716
>> YEAH, BUT ARE YOU GONNA COME,

382
00:08:35,716 --> 00:08:37,384
LIKE, AFTER HE'S BORN?

383
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,424
>> YEAH.

384
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:22,295
>> ALL RIGHT.

385
00:09:22,295 --> 00:09:23,764
>> BYE.

386
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:24,932
SCHOOL ISN'T JUST IMPORTANT TO

387
00:09:24,932 --> 00:09:25,733
MY MOM.

388
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:26,900
IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME TOO.

389
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,501
GRADUATING ON TIME AND WITH GOOD

390
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:29,770
GRADES IS A MUST.

391
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:31,371
THE BABY IS DUE RIGHT AROUND MY

392
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:32,806
CHRISTMAS BREAK, SO AS LONG AS I

393
00:09:32,806 --> 00:09:34,341
CAN STAY ON TRACK, I'LL ONLY

394
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:35,709
HAVE ONE SEMESTER LEFT AFTER

395
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:39,980
HE'S BORN.

396
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,448
KEEPING UP WITH GRADES WHILE I'M

397
00:09:41,448 --> 00:09:43,216
PREGNANT IS STRESSFUL, BUT AT

398
00:09:43,216 --> 00:09:44,351
LEAST THERE ARE FUN PARTS OF

399
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:45,653
BEING A SENIOR, LIKE THE

400
00:09:45,653 --> 00:09:47,587
HOMECOMING DANCE.

401
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,722
>> WE'RE GONNA DANCE EVERY DANCE

402
00:09:48,722 --> 00:09:50,357
THAT WE POSSIBLY CAN, OKAY?

403
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:51,892
>> [laughs]

404
00:09:51,892 --> 00:09:53,761
>> THIS IS OUR LAST HOMECOMING

405
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:55,095
NOT AS PARENTS YET.

406
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,730
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DANCE.

407
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,065
>> WHAT?

408
00:09:58,065 --> 00:09:59,332
ARE YOU EMBARRASSED, LIKE,

409
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,267
PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT US?

410
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,334
>> NO, I JUST--

411
00:10:01,334 --> 00:10:02,535
>> OR ARE YOU EMBARRASSED 'CAUSE

412
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:03,637
YOU THINK I'LL MAKE FUN OF YOU?

413
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:04,371
>> PROBABLY.

414
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:05,038
YEAH, THAT.

415
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:06,339
>> I WOULD NEVER MAKE FUN.

416
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:08,608
DON'T BE NERVOUS.

417
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,310
I CAN'T DANCE THAT GOOD.

418
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,411
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DANCE AT

419
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:11,979
ALL.

420
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:13,113
WHEN SOMEONE, LIKE, TRIES TO

421
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,014
FORCE ME TO DANCE,

422
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:17,084
I WILL JUST, LIKE, RUN OFF.

423
00:10:17,084 --> 00:10:18,518
>> [laughs]

424
00:10:18,518 --> 00:10:20,020
>> I'VE NEVER DANCED.

425
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,021
>> WELL, I DON'T WANT TO FORCE

426
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:21,588
YOU.

427
00:10:21,588 --> 00:10:22,589
LIKE, IF YOU REALLY DON'T WANT

428
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:23,623
TO, WE DON'T HAVE TO, BUT I DO

429
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:24,992
WANT TO A LITTLE.

430
00:10:24,992 --> 00:10:25,893
>> ALL RIGHT.

431
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:27,027
>> THIS IS OUR FIRST DANCE

432
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:27,861
TOGETHER.

433
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:29,062
IT'S THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE EVER

434
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,330
SEEN ME IN A DRESS.

435
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:31,631
YOU KNOW THAT?

436
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,667
>> YEAH.

437
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,535
ARE YOU ALMOST FINISHED?

438
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:36,269
>> YEAH.

439
00:10:36,269 --> 00:10:37,470
I'M PUTTING ON MY SHOES.

440
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:39,072
HOPEFULLY, MY PREGNANT SELF CAN

441
00:10:39,072 --> 00:10:41,875
WALK IN THESE.

442
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:42,810
>> NICE.

443
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:43,744
>> [laughs]

444
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:44,411
THANKS.

445
00:10:44,411 --> 00:10:45,879
>> YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

446
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:46,814
>> THANKS.

447
00:10:46,814 --> 00:10:47,915
YOU WANT TO HELP ME ZIPPER THIS

448
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:49,249
NOW?

449
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,118
[laughs]

450
00:10:51,118 --> 00:10:51,852
STOP.

451
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:53,787
YOU'RE MAKING ME BLUSH.

452
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,026
DANCING IS SO FUN, EVEN IF I

453
00:10:59,026 --> 00:11:00,360
HAVE A BIG BELLY.

454
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,829
FOR ONCE, I WANT TO FORGET

455
00:11:01,829 --> 00:11:03,096
ABOUT THE STRESSES OF LIVING

456
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:04,732
WITH JOEY'S FAMILY AND JUST BE A

457
00:11:04,732 --> 00:11:08,836
TEENAGER.

458
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:10,804
JOEY AND I USUALLY MEET UP AFTER

459
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:12,439
SCHOOL JUST TO HANG OUT, BUT

460
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:13,941
TODAY I HAVE A CHECKUP WITH THE

461
00:11:13,941 --> 00:11:14,742
DOCTOR.

462
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:17,110
SINCE NEITHER OF US CAN DRIVE,

463
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,746
THAT MEANS A BUS RIDE AND A LONG

464
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:19,446
WALK.

465
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:23,116
>> AHH, FINALLY, A CAR.

466
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:24,284
>> NO, YOU NEED TO LEARN HOW TO

467
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:25,986
DRIVE FIRST.

468
00:11:25,986 --> 00:11:27,320
HOW WOULD YOU EVEN GET A CAR?

469
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,588
WE NEED JOBS.

470
00:11:28,588 --> 00:11:30,190
THAT'S WHAT WE NEED.

471
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,158
>> WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO IF

472
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:32,625
YOU GO INTO LABOR AT SCHOOL?

473
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:34,027
>> IF IT HAPPENS IN SCHOOL, THAT

474
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:34,862
WOULD BE COOL.

475
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:35,729
>> WHY?

476
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:36,964
>> BECAUSE THEN PEOPLE WILL TALK

477
00:11:36,964 --> 00:11:37,630
ABOUT IT.

478
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,832
"HEY, YOU KNOW THAT GIRL?

479
00:11:38,832 --> 00:11:40,533
HER WATER BROKE TODAY IN CLASS.

480
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,736
IT WAS NASTY."

481
00:11:42,736 --> 00:11:44,071
I CAN JOKE ABOUT MY WATER

482
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:45,438
BREAKING IN SCHOOL, BUT THE

483
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:47,307
TRUTH IS, I'M REALLY NERVOUS

484
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:49,509
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

485
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:50,543
>> HI, ALLISON.

486
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:51,378
HI, JOEY.

487
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,545
HOW ARE YOU GUYS DOING TODAY?

488
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:53,881
>> I'M GOOD.

489
00:11:53,881 --> 00:11:55,916
JUST WAITING.

490
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,851
>> SO WHAT I WANT TO DO IS KIND

491
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:59,586
OF TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT SOME

492
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:00,720
QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS THAT YOU

493
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,255
MIGHT HAVE ABOUT LABOR.

494
00:12:02,255 --> 00:12:03,690
>> WHEN MY WATER BREAKS, IS IT

495
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,092
GONNA BE, LIKE, IT'S NOT GONNA

496
00:12:05,092 --> 00:12:06,026
BE, LIKE, A PUDDLE, RIGHT,

497
00:12:06,026 --> 00:12:06,794
OR WHAT HAPPENS?

498
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:08,028
DOES IT JUST LOOK LIKE I PEED

499
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:09,062
MYSELF OR WHAT?

500
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:10,263
>> WELL, YOUR WATER BREAKING CAN

501
00:12:10,263 --> 00:12:11,398
HAPPEN A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS.

502
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,533
IT MIGHT BE A HUGE GUSH.

503
00:12:13,533 --> 00:12:14,734
IT MIGHT JUST BE LITTLE

504
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:15,435
TRICKLES.

505
00:12:15,435 --> 00:12:16,436
SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T BREAK AT

506
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:17,537
ALL AT HOME.

507
00:12:17,537 --> 00:12:18,972
I HAVE TO BREAK IT IN LABOR.

508
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:19,973
IT'S JUST KIND OF A MYSTERY.

509
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:20,941
YOU DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT'S

510
00:12:20,941 --> 00:12:21,641
GONNA HAPPEN.

511
00:12:21,641 --> 00:12:23,543
>> THAT'S GREAT.

512
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:24,744
[laughter]

513
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,712
>> I WENT TO REGISTER AT THE

514
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:27,314
HOSPITAL, AND THEY TOLD ME I

515
00:12:27,314 --> 00:12:28,348
COULD HAVE AS MANY PEOPLE AS I

516
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:29,149
WANT IN THE ROOM.

517
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,150
HOW MANY PEOPLE DO YOU ALLOW?

518
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,451
>> WELL, DO YOU HAVE A RULE?

519
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:32,252
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

520
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,186
>> I DON'T WANT HIS MOM IN

521
00:12:33,186 --> 00:12:34,687
THERE.

522
00:12:34,687 --> 00:12:35,388
>> OKAY.

523
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:36,523
>> SHE'S, LIKE, A LOUD WOMAN.

524
00:12:36,523 --> 00:12:37,490
I DON'T WANT HER IN IT.

525
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:38,826
>> SO YOU HAVE TO TELL ME,

526
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:40,861
AND YOU HAVE TO TELL YOUR NURSES

527
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:42,129
WHAT'S GONNA MAKE THIS THE BEST

528
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:43,596
EXPERIENCE FOR YOU,

529
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:44,597
AND WE WILL DO EVERYTHING WE

530
00:12:44,597 --> 00:12:45,132
CAN.

531
00:12:45,132 --> 00:12:46,399
>> THAT SOUNDS GOOD.

532
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:47,835
I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO WORRY

533
00:12:47,835 --> 00:12:48,936
ABOUT WHO TO HAVE IN THE

534
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,871
DELIVERY ROOM, BUT JOEY'S MOM IS

535
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:53,941
SO UNPREDICTABLE AND EXPLOSIVE.

536
00:12:53,941 --> 00:12:54,942
IT'S REALLY MAKING ME THINK

537
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:56,476
ABOUT THE KINDS OF PARENTS I

538
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:58,278
WANT US TO BE.

539
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:03,951
I WANT TO BE A GOOD MOTHER,

540
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:05,552
LIKE, KIND OF FUN, BUT ALSO,

541
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:06,753
LIKE, I WANT TO BE A LITTLE

542
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:07,520
STRICT WITH HIM.

543
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:09,422
I THINK I'LL BE A LITTLE STRICT,

544
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:10,523
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT HIM TO TURN

545
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,125
OUT LIKE US,

546
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:13,961
AND I WANT US BOTH TO BE THERE.

547
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:15,162
I DON'T WANT HIM TO TURN OUT

548
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:16,663
WITH ONE PARENT, AND I DON'T

549
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:17,831
WANT HIM TO GET A GIRL PREGNANT

550
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,332
WHEN HE'S A TEENAGER.

551
00:13:19,332 --> 00:13:20,533
LIKE, I DON'T WANT HIM--I'LL

552
00:13:20,533 --> 00:13:22,269
PROBABLY BE STRICT.

553
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:23,703
SO ARE YOU SCARED?

554
00:13:23,703 --> 00:13:24,804
>> I'M PROBABLY GONNA BE SCARED

555
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,805
ABOUT NOT BEING A GOOD ENOUGH

556
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:26,473
PARENT.

557
00:13:26,473 --> 00:13:27,474
>> YEAH, 'CAUSE, YOU KNOW HOW

558
00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:28,708
PEOPLE SAY YOU PARENT HOW YOUR

559
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,611
PARENTS PARENTED?

560
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:35,048
AND OUR PARENTS, UH....

561
00:13:35,048 --> 00:13:36,249
I DON'T KNOW.

562
00:13:36,249 --> 00:13:37,517
THIS IS HARDER THAN IT SHOULD

563
00:13:37,517 --> 00:13:39,853
BE, RIGHT?

564
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:40,854
I DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE OUR

565
00:13:40,854 --> 00:13:42,655
PARENTS.

566
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,091
LIKE, EVENTUALLY, THEY JUST

567
00:13:44,091 --> 00:13:46,393
GAVE UP ON US.

568
00:13:46,393 --> 00:13:48,495
I'LL NEVER GIVE UP ON HIM.

569
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:50,297
>> ME NEITHER.

570
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:58,305
JOEY AND I KNOW WE'RE HAVING A

571
00:13:58,305 --> 00:14:00,140
BOY, AND WE DECIDED TO NAME HIM

572
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,076
AYDENN.

573
00:14:03,076 --> 00:14:04,477
MY MOM JUST SENT ME A CHECK FOR

574
00:14:04,477 --> 00:14:05,845
A LITTLE BIT OF MONEY,

575
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:06,880
SO WE'RE EXCITED TO START

576
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,615
GETTING SOME CUTE BABY STUFF.

577
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:09,883
DO YOU WANT TO GET A STROLLER

578
00:14:09,883 --> 00:14:10,984
LIKE THIS OR A STROLLER LIKE--

579
00:14:10,984 --> 00:14:12,152
>> I WANT A BIG STROLLER.

580
00:14:12,152 --> 00:14:13,420
>> I LIKE THIS BLUE ONE.

581
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,455
HOW MUCH IS IT?

582
00:14:15,455 --> 00:14:17,657
>> WHOA, $300 FOR THIS.

583
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:19,159
>> I LIKE THIS.

584
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:19,960
>> HOW MUCH IS IT?

585
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,029
>> UH...$12.

586
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:22,695
>> $12?

587
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,497
WE ONLY GOT, LIKE, $20.

588
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:26,566
>> I KNOW.

589
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:27,667
>> WE NEED A LOT OF MONEY TO

590
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:29,002
SUPPORT A BABY.

591
00:14:29,002 --> 00:14:31,138
>> EVERY TIME I'M IN SCHOOL,

592
00:14:31,138 --> 00:14:32,205
PEOPLE ALWAYS TELL ME STUFF LIKE

593
00:14:32,205 --> 00:14:32,839
THAT.

594
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:34,041
"DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IT COSTS

595
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:36,009
FOR A BABY PER YEAR?"

596
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:36,977
>> WHICH ONES DO YOU WANT TO

597
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:37,710
GET?

598
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:38,946
>> HOW MUCH IS THIS ONE?

599
00:14:38,946 --> 00:14:40,080
>> THIS ONE'S $5.50.

600
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:43,416
>> GET THAT ONE.

601
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,952
>> $4.50.

602
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:47,754
>> LET'S GET THOSE TWO.

603
00:14:47,754 --> 00:14:50,257
>> $10.82.

604
00:14:50,257 --> 00:14:51,358
>> YOU KNOW HOW MUCH IS LEFT ON

605
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:52,459
THERE?

606
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:53,994
>> $10.

607
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:55,128
>> I NEED A WALLET.

608
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:56,096
>> THERE'S A LOT OF STUFF WE

609
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:56,729
NEED.

610
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:57,965
>> IT'S SCARY TO THINK ABOUT HOW

611
00:14:57,965 --> 00:14:59,466
MUCH WE NEED, AND WITH THE BABY

612
00:14:59,466 --> 00:15:00,867
COMING IN THREE MONTHS, WE HAVE

613
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:03,603
A LOT TO FIGURE OUT.

614
00:15:03,603 --> 00:15:05,038
>> I'LL GET THE BIBS.

615
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:06,473
>> JOEY'S MOM HAS BEEN ON EDGE

616
00:15:06,473 --> 00:15:07,975
LATELY AND WANTS THE PLACE TO

617
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:09,042
HERSELF FOR THE WEEKEND.

618
00:15:09,042 --> 00:15:10,643
JOEY'S GRANDMA HAS AGREED TO LET

619
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:11,811
US STAY WITH HER FOR A COUPLE

620
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:13,280
DAYS, WHICH IS JUST FINE WITH

621
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,481
ME.

622
00:15:14,481 --> 00:15:15,582
>> MAN, GRANDMA DOESN'T HAVE NO

623
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:16,149
TEA?

624
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:18,986
SHE ALWAYS HAS TEA.

625
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:21,154
GET SOME WATER BEFORE WE GO.

626
00:15:21,154 --> 00:15:24,624
OH, MAN, IT'S TOO HOT.

627
00:15:24,624 --> 00:15:26,093
[sighs]

628
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:27,327
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

629
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:28,195
>> NOTHING.

630
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:29,162
>> ALLISON, GET ME A BANANA,

631
00:15:29,162 --> 00:15:32,265
PLEASE, IF YOU DON'T MIND.

632
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,033
>> HERE, DAMIEN.

633
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,001
GIVE IT TO YOUR MOM.

634
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:35,302
I'M NOT GETTING UP.

635
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:36,269
>> AND DON'T THROW IT AT HIM

636
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:36,936
LIKE THAT.

637
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,038
>> I DIDN'T THROW IT AT HIM.

638
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:38,871
>> YES, YOU DID.

639
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:40,073
>> IT DIDN'T HIT HIM.

640
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:41,241
>> BUT IT HIT THE COUCH.

641
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:42,609
>> IT DIDN'T HIT HIM, THOUGH.

642
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:43,510
>> BUT IT HIT THE COUCH.

643
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,544
>> BUT I WASN'T THROWING IT AT

644
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:45,112
HIM.

645
00:15:45,112 --> 00:15:46,179
>> YOU GET ON MY NERVES,

646
00:15:46,179 --> 00:15:46,980
ALLISON, SOMETIMES.

647
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:47,714
YOU REALLY DO.

648
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:48,581
>> I DON'T CARE.

649
00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:49,616
>> WELL, THEN, YOU KNOW WHAT?

650
00:15:49,616 --> 00:15:50,617
YOU CAN GO STAY WITH YOUR MOM

651
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:51,451
AND YOUR DADDY.

652
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:52,452
>> YOU TOLD ME I COULD STAY IN

653
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,486
YOUR HOUSE, BUT YOU DON'T TAKE

654
00:15:53,486 --> 00:15:54,154
CARE OF US.

655
00:15:54,154 --> 00:15:55,122
THAT'S WHY WE'RE OVER HERE.

656
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:55,722
>> SO.

657
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:56,723
WHY SHOULD I TAKE CARE OF YOU?

658
00:15:56,723 --> 00:15:57,857
YOU AIN'T MY DAUGHTER.

659
00:15:57,857 --> 00:15:59,792
YOU ARE NOT MY DAUGHTER, GIRL.

660
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:02,129
THAT'S MY SON, AND MY SON

661
00:16:02,129 --> 00:16:03,430
DON'T THROW [bleep] IN MY FACE,

662
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,065
SO [bleep] YOU, BITCH.

663
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:05,798
YOU HEAR THAT?

664
00:16:05,798 --> 00:16:07,100
GET THE [bleep] OUT.

665
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:07,800
GET OUT.

666
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:08,701
>> GET OUT OF HERE, MAN.

667
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:09,269
>> NO.

668
00:16:09,269 --> 00:16:11,138
[bleep] HER.

669
00:16:11,138 --> 00:16:12,172
YOU [bleep].

670
00:16:12,172 --> 00:16:13,273
WHAT WRONG WITH YOU, [bleep]

671
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:14,141
HITTING ME?

672
00:16:14,141 --> 00:16:14,974
>> I DON'T CARE.

673
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,343
>> GET THE [bleep] OUT OF HERE.

674
00:16:16,343 --> 00:16:19,212
>> I DON'T HAVE TO.

675
00:16:19,212 --> 00:16:20,080
>> YOU MOTHER[bleep].

676
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,414
DON'T YOU EVER CALL ME.

677
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:22,149
YOU HEAR THAT?

678
00:16:22,149 --> 00:16:23,250
EVER.

679
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,151
[bleep] YOU.

680
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:24,851
THAT'S RIGHT.

681
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:25,952
YOUR MAMA DIDN'T WANT YOU,

682
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:27,187
AND YOUR DADDY DIDN'T WANT YOU.

683
00:16:27,187 --> 00:16:28,588
YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE NOBODY'S

684
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:29,989
AROUND FOR YOU.

685
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:30,957
YOU DON'T EVER HIT ME IN MY

686
00:16:30,957 --> 00:16:31,691
[bleep] MOUTH.

687
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:32,792
I'M GONNA PRESS CHARGES ON YOUR

688
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:33,493
BITCH[bleep].

689
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:34,427
>> I DIDN'T EVEN HIT YOU.

690
00:16:34,427 --> 00:16:35,362
>> I'LL [bleep] YOU UP AND

691
00:16:35,362 --> 00:16:36,196
[bleep] HER UP TOO.

692
00:16:36,196 --> 00:16:37,297
I DON'T GIVE A [bleep] IF SHE'S

693
00:16:37,297 --> 00:16:37,930
PREGNANT.

694
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,799
MOM, I GOT IT ON WITH ALLISON.

695
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:41,168
YOUR [bleep] GRANDSON [bleep]

696
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:42,335
POPPED ME IN MY MOUTH BECAUSE OF

697
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:43,436
THAT LITTLE BITCH.

698
00:16:43,436 --> 00:16:44,104
SO WHAT?

699
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:45,004
I'M A DOPE FIEND, BITCH.

700
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:45,672
WHAT?

701
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:46,939
AT LEAST I SEE MY KIDS.

702
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,075
WHAT'S YOUR [bleep] PARENTS'

703
00:16:48,075 --> 00:16:50,143
PROBLEM, HUH?

704
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:51,511
THEY DON'T EVEN DO DRUGS, AND

705
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:52,645
THEY DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU.

706
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:53,580
I'M TIRED OF IT.

707
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:54,581
>> WELL, THEN, GET OUT.

708
00:16:54,581 --> 00:16:55,415
>> NO, [bleep] YOU.

709
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:56,383
THIS IS MY MOTHER'S [bleep]

710
00:16:56,383 --> 00:16:57,016
HOUSE.

711
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:57,950
>> YEAH, YOU'RE NOT AROUND

712
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,618
EITHER; GO.

713
00:16:58,618 --> 00:16:59,552
>> I DON'T GIVE A [bleep].

714
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:00,520
>> YOU KNOW, WE CAN CALL THE

715
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,488
POLICE ON YOU: CHARGING ON A

716
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:02,222
PREGNANT GIRL.

717
00:17:02,222 --> 00:17:03,056
>> DID I TOUCH HER?

718
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:04,057
SHE DIDN'T DO--I DIDN'T TOUCH

719
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:04,624
HER.

720
00:17:04,624 --> 00:17:05,725
>> YEAH, MAYBE YOU CAN GO AWAY.

721
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:06,326
>> NO.

722
00:17:06,326 --> 00:17:07,227
I'VE DONE A LOT FOR YOU.

723
00:17:07,227 --> 00:17:08,195
YEAH, I WAS A [bleep] DRUG

724
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:09,296
ADDICT, BUT I STRUGGLED FOR YOU

725
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:09,829
ASS.

726
00:17:09,829 --> 00:17:10,897
I WASN'T A [bleep] BAD MOTHER,

727
00:17:10,897 --> 00:17:12,099
AND YOU'RE GONNA TURN MY BACK

728
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:13,133
FOR THAT BITCH?

729
00:17:13,133 --> 00:17:14,601
IF GOD WOULD HAVE TOLD ME THE

730
00:17:14,601 --> 00:17:16,069
FUTURE, I WOULD HAVE SAID, "YOU

731
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:16,736
KNOW WHAT?

732
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:17,537
ABORT THAT CHILD.

733
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:18,571
ABORT IT."

734
00:17:18,571 --> 00:17:19,839
I WANT HER OUT.

735
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,673
I WANT HER OUT.

736
00:17:20,673 --> 00:17:21,774
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO STEP FOOT

737
00:17:21,774 --> 00:17:22,709
IN MY [bleep] HOUSE, AND I

738
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:23,476
MEAN THAT, JOEY.

739
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:24,411
[bleep] YOU.

740
00:17:24,411 --> 00:17:25,912
I'M DEAD TO YOU NOW.

741
00:17:25,912 --> 00:17:26,713
>> COME ON.

742
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:29,048
LET'S GO. LET'S GO.

743
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,317
>> DID YOU HIT HER?

744
00:17:30,317 --> 00:17:34,454
>> NO.

745
00:17:34,454 --> 00:17:35,455
>> WELL, SHE WAS CHARGING AT

746
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:36,055
YOU.

747
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:36,723
>> I KNOW.

748
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:37,557
SHE'S A CRAZY BITCH.

749
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:38,291
THAT'S WHY.

750
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:38,991
>> WHATEVER.

751
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:43,263
I DON'T CARE.

752
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:48,601
>> * MOVE SLOW *

753
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:56,309
* WE DON'T HAVE NO PLACE TO GO *

754
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:11,991
>> AFTER JOEY'S MOM'S FREAK OUT,

755
00:18:11,991 --> 00:18:14,261
I NEEDED TO HEAR MY MOM'S VOICE.

756
00:18:14,261 --> 00:18:15,462
SHE WAS REALLY UPSET WHEN SHE

757
00:18:15,462 --> 00:18:17,264
HEARD WHAT HAPPENED.

758
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,875
>> YEAH.

759
00:18:34,247 --> 00:18:35,548
NOW.

760
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:36,449
>> I CAN'T JUST LEAVE.

761
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,251
>> YES, YOU CAN.

762
00:18:49,829 --> 00:18:51,631
>> YEAH.

763
00:19:00,106 --> 00:19:01,908
>> OKAY.

764
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:06,579
I LOVE YOU, AND I WILL TALK TO

765
00:19:06,579 --> 00:19:07,980
YOU LATER, OKAY?

766
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,383
>> OKAY, I LOVE YOU TOO.

767
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:12,352
>> I FEEL SO TORN.

768
00:19:12,352 --> 00:19:13,653
GOING BACK TO NEW JERSEY WOULD

769
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,688
BE THE EASY ANSWER, BUT JOEY

770
00:19:15,688 --> 00:19:17,056
IS TOO YOUNG TO LEAVE HOME,

771
00:19:17,056 --> 00:19:18,691
AND I WANT MY BABY TO HAVE BOTH

772
00:19:18,691 --> 00:19:19,992
PARENTS.

773
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,361
WE NEED JOEY'S GRANDMA TO HELP

774
00:19:21,361 --> 00:19:22,995
US FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO.

775
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,163
>> WHAT HAPPENED?

776
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,432
>> SHE JUST STARTED SAYING THAT

777
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:26,466
I PUNCHED HER.

778
00:19:26,466 --> 00:19:27,567
>> WELL, YOU ALREADY KNOW SHE'S

779
00:19:27,567 --> 00:19:28,835
GONNA SAY THAT.

780
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:30,570
SHE'S A DRAMA QUEEN, BUT...

781
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,305
>> HIS MOM TEXTED HIM, "I DON'T

782
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:33,906
WANT EITHER OF YOU AT MY HOUSE,"

783
00:19:33,906 --> 00:19:34,974
LIKE, TEXTING JOEY, "STAY OUT OF

784
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:35,675
MY HOUSE."

785
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:37,244
>> I DON'T KNOW.

786
00:19:37,244 --> 00:19:38,311
I DON'T KNOW.

787
00:19:38,311 --> 00:19:39,178
I GUESS--I DON'T KNOW.

788
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,847
AND Y'ALL CAN JUST STAY WITH ME

789
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:42,649
UNTIL Y'ALL CAN GET BACK--

790
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:43,950
UNTIL Y'ALL CAN GET ON YOUSE

791
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:44,817
FEET.

792
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:46,986
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, MAYBE I CAN DO

793
00:19:46,986 --> 00:19:48,521
IT FOR A YEAR,

794
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,457
UNTIL Y'ALL CAN GET IT TOGETHER.

795
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:51,824
>> IT'S SUCH A RELIEF THAT

796
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:53,025
JOEY'S GRANDMA SAID WE COULD

797
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,060
STAY WITH HER.

798
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,295
I WISH WE COULD SETTLE IN RIGHT

799
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:56,929
AWAY, BUT ALL OF OUR STUFF IS

800
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:59,599
STILL AT HIS MOM'S HOUSE.

801
00:19:59,599 --> 00:20:00,600
>> HIKE.

802
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:01,701
>> SINCE WE AREN'T GOING TO GET

803
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:02,835
OUR STUFF UNTIL THE END OF THE

804
00:20:02,835 --> 00:20:04,704
WEEK, JOEY'S USING THIS TIME TO

805
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:05,972
PLAY FOOTBALL WITH FRIENDS,

806
00:20:05,972 --> 00:20:08,174
BUT I HAVE TO FOCUS ON SCHOOL,

807
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:09,476
BECAUSE MY DUE DATE IS ONLY TWO

808
00:20:09,476 --> 00:20:10,176
MONTHS AWAY.

809
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:11,344
>> SO ARE YOU GONNA MISS OUT ON

810
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:12,579
ANYTHING, LIKE, THIS YEAR?

811
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:13,680
>> WHY, BECAUSE THE BABY OR

812
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,514
WHATEVER?

813
00:20:14,514 --> 00:20:15,615
>> ARE YOU SCARED OF MISSING OUT

814
00:20:15,615 --> 00:20:16,416
ON ANYTHING?

815
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,384
>> I'M NOT GONNA MISS OUT ON

816
00:20:17,384 --> 00:20:18,251
ANYTHING SENIOR YEAR.

817
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:19,051
I CAN'T HAVE THAT.

818
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,119
I WON'T MISS OUT ON PROM,

819
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:21,153
BUT, LIKE, HE'LL BE THERE,

820
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:22,221
SO HE'LL PROBABLY BE CRYING,

821
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:23,890
PROBABLY TAKE AWAY FROM MY FUN

822
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,592
WITH MY FRIENDS.

823
00:20:25,592 --> 00:20:26,893
SO I WON'T MISS OUT ON ANYTHING,

824
00:20:26,893 --> 00:20:28,628
BUT I'LL MISS OUT ON, LIKE,

825
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:29,962
DOING THE TEENAGE THING.

826
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:30,997
>> SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH

827
00:20:30,997 --> 00:20:31,764
SLEEPING HABITS?

828
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:32,732
>> I DON'T KNOW.

829
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:34,567
WHEN IT'S BORN, I'M WORRIED THAT

830
00:20:34,567 --> 00:20:36,503
MY GRADES ARE GONNA GO DOWN A

831
00:20:36,503 --> 00:20:37,404
LITTLE.

832
00:20:37,404 --> 00:20:38,638
ALL MY CLASSES SO FAR, THEY

833
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:39,906
SEEM, LIKE, I GOT IT,

834
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,641
BUT PRE-CAL, I HAVE TO STAY

835
00:20:41,641 --> 00:20:42,809
AWAKE TO GET IT,

836
00:20:42,809 --> 00:20:43,910
SO THAT'S THE CLASS I'M WORRIED

837
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:44,511
ABOUT.

838
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:46,012
AND WHEN THE BABY'S BORN, I'M

839
00:20:46,012 --> 00:20:47,647
GONNA MISS, LIKE, WEEKS.

840
00:20:47,647 --> 00:20:48,581
THAT'S THE ONLY THING I'M

841
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,316
WORRIED ABOUT.

842
00:20:49,316 --> 00:20:50,317
I DON'T WANT MY SCHOOLWORK TO

843
00:20:50,317 --> 00:20:50,883
SLIP.

844
00:20:50,883 --> 00:20:51,884
I'LL JUST HAVE TO GET USED TO

845
00:20:51,884 --> 00:20:52,419
IT.

846
00:20:52,419 --> 00:20:53,353
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO,

847
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:53,953
REALLY.

848
00:20:53,953 --> 00:20:55,087
WHAT CAN I DO, TAKE ENERGY

849
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:57,624
DRINKS?

850
00:20:57,624 --> 00:21:00,993
[laughter]

851
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:01,894
>> Y'ALL READY?

852
00:21:01,894 --> 00:21:02,862
WELL, LET'S GET IT OVER WITH.

853
00:21:02,862 --> 00:21:03,830
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FACE THE

854
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:04,831
DRAMA EVENTUALLY REGARDLESS.

855
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:05,832
Y'ALL GOT TO GO OVER THERE AND

856
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:06,566
GET YOUR STUFF.

857
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:07,233
>> YEAH.

858
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:08,768
>> EITHER SHE GONNA COME OUT AND

859
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,169
CAUSE A SCENE AND--

860
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:11,404
IT WILL BE ALL RIGHT.

861
00:21:11,404 --> 00:21:12,939
>> WE GAVE JOEY'S MOM SOME TIME

862
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:14,841
TO CALM DOWN, BUT NOW WE HAVE TO

863
00:21:14,841 --> 00:21:16,175
GO GET HER STUFF.

864
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:17,610
SOME OF JOEY'S FAMILY IS HERE TO

865
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,211
HELP, BUT I'M FEELING REALLY

866
00:21:19,211 --> 00:21:20,012
NERVOUS.

867
00:21:20,012 --> 00:21:21,047
>> WHAT'S WRONG, ALLISON?

868
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:21,748
>> NOTHING.

869
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:23,282
>> YOU LOOK ALL DEPRESSED, MAN.

870
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:24,451
DON'T LET IT GET TO YOU, MAN.

871
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:25,518
Y'ALL GONNA GET YOUR STUFF RIGHT

872
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:26,218
NOW.

873
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:27,253
>> I JUST DON'T WANT ANY

874
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:27,920
TROUBLE.

875
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:28,955
>> EHH, SHE AIN'T GONNA START NO

876
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:29,589
TROUBLE.

877
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:30,457
>> I WON'T.

878
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:31,891
>> NO, SHE WON'T.

879
00:21:31,891 --> 00:21:32,825
>> THERE AIN'T GONNA BE NO

880
00:21:32,825 --> 00:21:34,126
TROUBLE, MAN.

881
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,862
>> WHEN WE GOT THERE, JOEY'S

882
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:36,796
GRANDMA WAS ALREADY IN THE

883
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,230
HOUSE, AND HIS MOM WAS OUTSIDE

884
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:38,998
WAITING FOR US.

885
00:21:38,998 --> 00:21:39,999
>> ARE YOU GETTING OFF, OR ARE

886
00:21:39,999 --> 00:21:40,733
YOU STAYING IN?

887
00:21:40,733 --> 00:21:41,534
>> I'M GETTING OFF.

888
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:43,102
IT'S MY CRAP.

889
00:21:50,009 --> 00:21:51,811
>> YEAH, YEAH.

890
00:21:58,385 --> 00:22:00,252
>> THAT'S YOUR SON RIGHT THERE.

891
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:01,187
>> I DON'T CARE.

892
00:22:01,187 --> 00:22:02,221
>> WELL, YOU NEED TO CARE.

893
00:22:02,221 --> 00:22:03,155
>> NO, I DON'T CARE.

894
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,156
HE SAT THERE, AND HE TALKED

895
00:22:04,156 --> 00:22:04,824
DOWN ON ME.

896
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:06,292
>> YOU--YOU SHOULD CARE

897
00:22:06,292 --> 00:22:07,293
REGARDLESS.

898
00:22:07,293 --> 00:22:08,194
>> [bleep] YOU.

899
00:22:08,194 --> 00:22:09,128
YOU KNOW THAT?

900
00:22:09,128 --> 00:22:10,129
YOU WANT TO SIT THERE...

901
00:22:10,129 --> 00:22:11,030
>> HEY, HEY, HEY, NO.

902
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,465
>> AND TELL ME LIKE THAT THAT I

903
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:13,299
COULDN'T SEE THE BABY?

904
00:22:13,299 --> 00:22:14,200
>> HEY.

905
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,835
>> THAT'S FINE, JOEY.

906
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:17,737
>> YEAH, THAT'S FINE.

907
00:22:17,737 --> 00:22:19,539
THAT'S RIGHT.

908
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:27,514
>> WHY DID YOU START [bleep]?

909
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:28,681
JUST GET EVERYTHING OUT OF

910
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:29,449
THERE.

911
00:22:29,449 --> 00:22:30,550
DANG.

912
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:31,651
>> YOU COULD TAKE THAT

913
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:32,619
GOD[bleep] ATTITUDE OUTSIDE,

914
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:33,486
'CAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT?

915
00:22:33,486 --> 00:22:34,521
YOU'RE IN MY HOUSE.

916
00:22:34,521 --> 00:22:35,855
GET YOUR [bleep] ASS OUT OF MY

917
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:36,756
[bleep] HOUSE, GIRL.

918
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:37,657
TAKE YOUR ASS IN THERE.

919
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:38,658
>> OH, YOU'RE SO MATURE, MOM.

920
00:22:38,658 --> 00:22:39,459
>> OH, YES, I AM.

921
00:22:39,459 --> 00:22:40,460
I AM.

922
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,394
>> NO, YOU'RE NOT.

923
00:22:41,394 --> 00:22:43,362
>> THE WORLD KNOWS THAT I'M A

924
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,965
PILL-POPPING ADDICT--

925
00:22:45,965 --> 00:22:47,066
BUT WHO THE HELL IS SHE TO THROW

926
00:22:47,066 --> 00:22:47,800
IT IN MY FACE?

927
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,201
>> ALLISON, GET IN THE TRUCK.

928
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:50,603
>> NEVER ONCE DID I THROW IT IN

929
00:22:50,603 --> 00:22:52,371
HER FACE ABOUT HER PARENTS.

930
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,305
WHO THE HELL GOT YOU YOUR

931
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:53,940
MEDICAID.

932
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,741
I DID.

933
00:22:54,741 --> 00:22:56,709
WHEN NOBODY WANTED YOU--

934
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,077
WHEN NOBODY WANTED YOU,

935
00:22:58,077 --> 00:22:59,712
I TOOK YOU IN, AND YOU'RE OVER

936
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,213
THERE NOW BUDDY-BUDDY WITH MY

937
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:03,816
MOTHER, WHO DIDN'T WANT YOU?

938
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:05,351
I DID A LOT FOR YOU ASS,

939
00:23:05,351 --> 00:23:07,219
ALLISON, A LOT.

940
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,788
YOU TORE MY SON AWAY FROM ME,

941
00:23:08,788 --> 00:23:09,889
AND ME AND MY SON HAD A

942
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,390
RELATIONSHIP LIKE THIS.

943
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,559
>> WELL, YOU NEVER HAVE TO SEE

944
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,193
ME AGAIN AFTER TODAY, OKAY?

945
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:15,795
>> AND I'M STILL GONNA SLEEP

946
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:16,663
GOOD, ALLISON.

947
00:23:16,663 --> 00:23:18,164
>> OKAY, GOOD.

948
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:19,899
>> YOUR MOTHER SLEEPS GOOD, AND

949
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:20,800
YOUR DADDY SLEEPS GOOD.

950
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:21,801
>> OKAY, BUT YOU NEVER HAVE TO

951
00:23:21,801 --> 00:23:22,802
SEE ME.

952
00:23:22,802 --> 00:23:23,503
I PROMISE.

953
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:24,604
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SEE ME OR SEE

954
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:26,105
YOUR SON, NOT SEE ME OR MY KID.

955
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:27,139
I PROMISE.

956
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:28,140
>> YOU'RE NOT GONNA USE THAT

957
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,208
BABY WITH ME, 'CAUSE I STILL

958
00:23:29,208 --> 00:23:30,042
SLEEP GOOD AT NIGHT.

959
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:31,578
>> OKAY, SLEEP GOOD.

960
00:23:31,578 --> 00:23:32,445
>> COME ON INSIDE.

961
00:23:32,445 --> 00:23:35,114
GET INSIDE.

962
00:23:35,114 --> 00:23:36,783
>> PUT THE [bleep] BABY STUFF IN

963
00:23:36,783 --> 00:23:37,950
THE BACK.

964
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,118
I'M TIRED OF HER ASS,

965
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:41,854
CRAZY [bleep] BITCH.

966
00:23:41,854 --> 00:23:42,955
>> WE ALMOST GOT EVERYTHING.

967
00:23:42,955 --> 00:23:45,091
WE COULD HEAD BACK IN A MINUTE.

968
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:46,726
>> ALL THIS FAMILY DRAMA ISN'T

969
00:23:46,726 --> 00:23:48,294
MAKING THIS PREGNANCY ANY

970
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:49,696
EASIER.

971
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:51,297
>> LET'S GO.

972
00:23:51,297 --> 00:23:52,431
THE THING IS THAT Y'ALL GOT YOUR

973
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:53,132
STUFF.

974
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:54,934
>> OKAY, BYE.

975
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:06,846
>> GETTING OUR STUFF BACK WAS

976
00:24:06,846 --> 00:24:07,980
REALLY DIFFICULT.

977
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,482
I'M SO RELIEVED THAT JOEY'S

978
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:10,717
GRANDMA TOOK US IN.

979
00:24:10,717 --> 00:24:11,718
IT'S BEEN EASIER KEEPING UP

980
00:24:11,718 --> 00:24:12,418
WITH SCHOOL.

981
00:24:12,418 --> 00:24:13,620
AND EVEN THOUGH HER OLD OFFICE

982
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,121
IS A LITTLE CRAMPED, IT'S A

983
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:16,656
MILLION TIMES BETTER THAN IT WAS

984
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:18,224
AT JOEY'S MOM'S HOUSE.

985
00:24:18,224 --> 00:24:19,726
SOON THIS IS GONNA BE OUR BABY

986
00:24:19,726 --> 00:24:21,628
RIGHT HERE.

987
00:24:21,628 --> 00:24:23,295
WE SHOULD PRACTICE.

988
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,363
WOULD YOU WANT TO SLEEP WITH HIM

989
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:25,765
IN BED?

990
00:24:25,765 --> 00:24:26,533
>> I DON'T KNOW.

991
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:27,534
>> HOW ABOUT WE SLEEP WITH HIM

992
00:24:27,534 --> 00:24:29,602
WHEN HE'S SIX OR SEVEN MONTHS?

993
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:31,738
NOT WHEN HE'S A NEWBORN.

994
00:24:31,738 --> 00:24:32,572
>> [sighs]

995
00:24:32,572 --> 00:24:33,706
>> READY TO GO TO BED?

996
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:35,341
>> I'M SLEEPY.

997
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:36,442
I LOVE YOU.

998
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:38,477
smooch!

999
00:24:42,381 --> 00:24:43,816
>> WITH AYDENN COMING SOON, WE

1000
00:24:43,816 --> 00:24:45,184
STILL HAVE A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT

1001
00:24:45,184 --> 00:24:46,452
TAKING CARE OF A NEWBORN.

1002
00:24:46,452 --> 00:24:47,787
SO YOU READ THE BABY BOOK MORE

1003
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:48,755
THAN ME.

1004
00:24:48,755 --> 00:24:49,956
WHAT, LIKE, WHAT DO YOU THINK WE

1005
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:52,625
NEED TO KNOW, BESIDES HOW TO

1006
00:24:52,625 --> 00:24:54,160
FEED IT AND WHAT TIME?

1007
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,427
I KNOW THERE'S, LIKE, TIMING TO

1008
00:24:55,427 --> 00:24:56,929
FEED HIM.

1009
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:58,965
>> YOU GOT TO CHANGE A DIAPER.

1010
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:00,366
HAVE YOU EVER CHANGED A DIAPER?

1011
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:01,801
>> YOU HAVE?

1012
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:03,269
>> MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS.

1013
00:25:03,269 --> 00:25:04,303
WE COULD DEMONSTRATE IT

1014
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:05,471
ON KITTY.

1015
00:25:05,471 --> 00:25:06,505
HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S IN FOR THE

1016
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:07,306
CHALLENGE.

1017
00:25:07,306 --> 00:25:08,875
>> [laughs]

1018
00:25:08,875 --> 00:25:09,609
OKAY, HOLD ON.

1019
00:25:09,609 --> 00:25:11,878
LET ME GET THE DIAPER.

1020
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:16,282
LAY HIM DOWN.

1021
00:25:16,282 --> 00:25:16,949
READY?

1022
00:25:16,949 --> 00:25:19,952
READY, KITTY?

1023
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:21,053
>> GET HIM.

1024
00:25:21,053 --> 00:25:23,756
>> OKAY.

1025
00:25:23,756 --> 00:25:24,657
YOU GOT FAT, KITTY.

1026
00:25:24,657 --> 00:25:25,658
YOU CAN'T EVEN FIT IN NEWBORN

1027
00:25:25,658 --> 00:25:28,761
DIAPERS.

1028
00:25:28,761 --> 00:25:29,461
HE'S KICKING.

1029
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:30,730
NOW I GOT HIS FEET.

1030
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:31,664
I WON'T BE THIS ROUGH WITH

1031
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:32,364
OUR KID.

1032
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:33,199
I PROMISE.

1033
00:25:33,199 --> 00:25:34,601
YOU UNDO THIS THING, RIGHT?

1034
00:25:34,601 --> 00:25:35,568
>> YEAH, AND YOU JUST STRAP

1035
00:25:35,568 --> 00:25:36,168
IT ON.

1036
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:37,169
>> IT STICKS?

1037
00:25:37,169 --> 00:25:37,870
>> YES.

1038
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:38,805
>> IT DOESN'T FEEL STICKY.

1039
00:25:38,805 --> 00:25:39,806
OKAY.

1040
00:25:39,806 --> 00:25:41,473
OW, HE'S NAILING ME.

1041
00:25:41,473 --> 00:25:43,142
>> NICE.

1042
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:45,244
HE LOOKS SEXY.

1043
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:48,447
>> WHAT A CUTE KITTY.

1044
00:25:48,447 --> 00:25:49,816
HOW DOES HE LOOK?

1045
00:25:49,816 --> 00:25:50,817
>> HE LOOKS GOOD.

1046
00:25:50,817 --> 00:25:51,951
LET'S SEE IF HE CAN WALK IN IT.

1047
00:25:51,951 --> 00:25:52,785
PUT HIM ON THE BED.

1048
00:25:52,785 --> 00:25:53,620
PUT HIM ON THE BED.

1049
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:57,657
[laughter]

1050
00:25:57,657 --> 00:25:59,191
YEAH, HE'S SEXY.

1051
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:00,960
>> BYE.

1052
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,663
WHAT A WASTE OF A DIAPER.

1053
00:26:03,663 --> 00:26:04,664
[wolf howling]

1054
00:26:04,664 --> 00:26:05,865
HALLOWEEN IS HERE, AND IT'S ONE

1055
00:26:05,865 --> 00:26:07,066
OF MY FAVORITE HOLIDAYS.

1056
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:07,834
HEY!

1057
00:26:07,834 --> 00:26:08,768
YOU SEE THAT?

1058
00:26:08,768 --> 00:26:10,302
>> ONE, TWO, THREE.

1059
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:11,470
>> I'M NOT GOING TO LET BEING

1060
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:12,705
PREGNANT KEEP ME FROM HAVING FUN

1061
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:13,906
TONIGHT.

1062
00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:15,975
WE'RE AWARE OF OUR AGE.

1063
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:16,643
THANK YOU.

1064
00:26:16,643 --> 00:26:17,777
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

1065
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:18,477
>> HEY.

1066
00:26:18,477 --> 00:26:20,012
TRICK OR TREAT?

1067
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:21,080
>> YOU GOT A PUMPKIN.

1068
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,381
>> OH, COOL.

1069
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:23,149
YOU GET DOUBLE.

1070
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:23,816
>> THANKS.

1071
00:26:23,816 --> 00:26:24,851
>> AT EIGHT MONTHS PREGNANT, I'M

1072
00:26:24,851 --> 00:26:26,485
GETTING TIRED AND UNCOMFORTABLE.

1073
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:27,754
SO INSTEAD OF GOING OUT TO PARTY

1074
00:26:27,754 --> 00:26:29,689
WITH OUR FRIENDS, JOEY AND I ARE

1075
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:30,757
CALLING IT A NIGHT.

1076
00:26:30,757 --> 00:26:32,458
>> SEE YOUS LATER.

1077
00:26:32,458 --> 00:26:33,359
>> AT LEAST WE GOT A LOT

1078
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:37,764
OF CANDY.

1079
00:26:37,764 --> 00:26:38,765
>> WHY?

1080
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:39,932
>> IT'S BEEN TWO WEEKS SINCE

1081
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,533
WE'VE HEARD FROM JOEY'S MOM.

1082
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:42,669
BUT SUDDENLY, SHE STARTED

1083
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:44,336
CALLING NONSTOP.

1084
00:26:44,336 --> 00:26:45,071
>> ALL RIGHT.

1085
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:46,172
>> SHE SAYS SHE'S SORRY AND HAS

1086
00:26:46,172 --> 00:26:47,640
SOMETHING EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO

1087
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:48,975
TELL US.

1088
00:26:48,975 --> 00:26:50,276
JOEY CONVINCED ME TO GO OVER AND

1089
00:26:50,276 --> 00:26:51,678
TALK TO HER, BUT I'M NOT SURE

1090
00:26:51,678 --> 00:26:53,079
IT'S SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

1091
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:56,515
I DON'T WANT TO GO HERE.

1092
00:26:56,515 --> 00:26:58,050
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D SET FOOT IN

1093
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:01,120
HER HOUSE AGAIN.

1094
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,455
>> UM...

1095
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:08,394
I'M GOING TO A REHAB.

1096
00:27:08,394 --> 00:27:10,096
>> WHEN ARE YOU GOING?

1097
00:27:10,096 --> 00:27:11,230
>> MONDAY.

1098
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,932
SO I'M GONNA BE GONE FOR ABOUT

1099
00:27:12,932 --> 00:27:16,168
FIVE DAYS DETOX.

1100
00:27:16,168 --> 00:27:18,004
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

1101
00:27:18,004 --> 00:27:19,906
>> IT'S WHEN YOU'RE REALLY BAD

1102
00:27:19,906 --> 00:27:21,841
ON SOMETHING, LIKE--

1103
00:27:21,841 --> 00:27:22,508
>> OPIATES.

1104
00:27:22,508 --> 00:27:23,442
>> OPIATES.

1105
00:27:23,442 --> 00:27:24,711
I'VE BEEN TAKING THEM FOR, LIKE,

1106
00:27:24,711 --> 00:27:27,980
WHAT, TEN YEARS?

1107
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,548
I'VE BEEN HOOKED ON THEM.

1108
00:27:29,548 --> 00:27:31,450
AND MY ADDICTION IS ALREADY

1109
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,785
TOO BAD.

1110
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:33,720
>> HOW LONG ARE YOU GONNA

1111
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,054
BE THERE?

1112
00:27:35,054 --> 00:27:36,255
>> BASICALLY ABOUT 35 DAYS I'LL

1113
00:27:36,255 --> 00:27:37,489
BE GONE.

1114
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:39,158
I HAVE TO THOUGH.

1115
00:27:39,158 --> 00:27:40,259
IT WAS ALREADY TO A POINT WHERE

1116
00:27:40,259 --> 00:27:41,227
I DIDN'T GIVE A [bleep] WHAT

1117
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:41,994
ANYBODY THOUGHT.

1118
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:44,764
YOU KNOW THAT.

1119
00:27:44,764 --> 00:27:47,800
SO I WANT TO AT LEAST BE CLEAN

1120
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,736
AND SOBER FOR AT LEAST THE BABY

1121
00:27:49,736 --> 00:27:51,003
AND FOR THE KIDS.

1122
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:52,271
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1123
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:54,774
>> HOPEFULLY YOU LIVE UP TO IT.

1124
00:27:54,774 --> 00:27:55,441
>> I KNOW.

1125
00:27:55,441 --> 00:27:56,308
I'VE TRIED IT BEFORE.

1126
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:57,543
>> WHAT'S SO DIFFERENT ABOUT

1127
00:27:57,543 --> 00:27:59,111
THIS TIME?

1128
00:27:59,111 --> 00:28:00,713
>> I DON'T--WELL, BECAUSE.

1129
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:01,981
THIS TIME IT'S DIFFERENT BECAUSE

1130
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:03,549
I WANT TO DO IT.

1131
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:04,583
I'M READY.

1132
00:28:04,583 --> 00:28:05,684
MY BODY IS JUST WORN

1133
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:09,956
OUT ALREADY.

1134
00:28:09,956 --> 00:28:11,090
TEN YEARS IS A LONG TIME TO BE

1135
00:28:11,090 --> 00:28:14,393
TAKING PILLS.

1136
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:15,627
>> JOEY'S MOM SEEMS SINCERE

1137
00:28:15,627 --> 00:28:17,363
ABOUT TRYING TO CHANGE,

1138
00:28:17,363 --> 00:28:19,098
BUT SHE'S SAID THIS BEFORE.

1139
00:28:19,098 --> 00:28:20,699
SO I HOPE THIS TIME IN REHAB

1140
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:21,901
WILL HELP HER BECOME THE PARENT

1141
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:23,102
WE NEED HER TO BE.

1142
00:28:23,102 --> 00:28:24,603
[chime dings]

1143
00:28:24,603 --> 00:28:25,805
WHILE JOEY'S MOM IS OFF IN

1144
00:28:25,805 --> 00:28:27,406
DETOX, WE HAVE TO SPEND THE

1145
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:28,574
MONTH GETTING EVERYTHING FOR

1146
00:28:28,574 --> 00:28:29,708
THE BABY.

1147
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,010
SO FOR THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, ALL

1148
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:32,779
WE'RE GOING TO DO IS CLEAN, SET

1149
00:28:32,779 --> 00:28:38,050
UP, AND DECORATE.

1150
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:39,018
IT'S BEEN A FEW WEEKS SINCE

1151
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:40,820
JOEY'S MOM LEFT FOR DETOX.

1152
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:41,854
WE HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HER, BUT

1153
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:43,255
SHE'S DUE BACK SOON.

1154
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:44,523
THIS IS MY LAST WEEK OF SCHOOL

1155
00:28:44,523 --> 00:28:45,958
BEFORE CHRISTMAS BREAK.

1156
00:28:45,958 --> 00:28:47,393
I REALLY HOPE THE DOCTOR SAYS

1157
00:28:47,393 --> 00:28:48,694
I'LL HAVE THE BABY NEXT WEEK SO

1158
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:50,229
I WON'T MISS MUCH SCHOOL.

1159
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,063
>> HELLO, ALLISON.

1160
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:51,730
>> HI, JOEY.

1161
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:53,032
HOW YOU GUYS DOING?

1162
00:28:53,032 --> 00:28:54,200
>> GOOD.

1163
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,134
>> HOW HAVE YOU BEEN FEELING

1164
00:28:55,134 --> 00:28:55,968
THIS WEEK?

1165
00:28:55,968 --> 00:28:59,605
>> FINE, JUST NORMAL.

1166
00:28:59,605 --> 00:29:01,507
>> SO HOW'S SCHOOL GOING?

1167
00:29:01,507 --> 00:29:02,708
>> GOOD, IT'S OUR LAST WEEK TILL

1168
00:29:02,708 --> 00:29:03,810
THE BREAK.

1169
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:04,811
>> ISN'T THAT EXCITING?

1170
00:29:04,811 --> 00:29:05,778
ARE YOU READY FOR CHRISTMAS?

1171
00:29:05,778 --> 00:29:07,814
>> YES.

1172
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:09,048
>> OKAY, WELL, YOUR MEASUREMENT

1173
00:29:09,048 --> 00:29:10,149
IS BETTER THIS WEEK.

1174
00:29:10,149 --> 00:29:11,083
DID YOU EAT A LOT?

1175
00:29:11,083 --> 00:29:12,885
[laughter]

1176
00:29:12,885 --> 00:29:14,120
>> MY PANTS DON'T BUTTON

1177
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:14,787
ANYMORE.

1178
00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:15,687
>> THEY'RE NOT BUTTONING

1179
00:29:15,687 --> 00:29:16,322
ANYMORE?

1180
00:29:16,322 --> 00:29:17,256
ARE YOU WEARING MATERNITY

1181
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:17,890
CLOTHES?

1182
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:20,192
>> NO. [laughs]

1183
00:29:20,192 --> 00:29:21,160
>> IN THE 40s.

1184
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,929
OKAY. SOUNDS GOOD.

1185
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:26,465
OKAY, SO WE'RE 39 WEEKS.

1186
00:29:26,465 --> 00:29:28,067
>> YEAH.

1187
00:29:28,067 --> 00:29:29,168
>> ARE YOU GETTING TIRED OF THE

1188
00:29:29,168 --> 00:29:29,869
WHOLE THING?

1189
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:30,937
>> YEAH.

1190
00:29:30,937 --> 00:29:31,871
>> WELL, THIS IS THE POINT

1191
00:29:31,871 --> 00:29:33,272
WHERE, YOU KNOW, YOU'RE READY TO

1192
00:29:33,272 --> 00:29:34,373
DELIVER.

1193
00:29:34,373 --> 00:29:35,607
SO WE'RE GONNA DELIVER YOU

1194
00:29:35,607 --> 00:29:36,542

SO YOU GET TO BE INDUCED

1196
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:38,577
THIS WEEK.

1197
00:29:38,577 --> 00:29:40,046
THE WAY I HAVE IT SET UP IS THAT

1198
00:29:40,046 --> 00:29:41,914
YOU'LL GO IN THURSDAY EVENING.

00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:45,651
OKAY, AND WHAT TIME DO YOU GET

>> 2:30.

1205
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:47,719
>> 2:30.

1206
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:49,588
>> SO I'M THINKING MAYBE

1207
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:51,891
9:00-ish WOULD BE A GOOD TIME.

1208
00:29:51,891 --> 00:29:53,159
SO WHAT YOU DO IS, YOU'LL GO TO

1209
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:54,626

YOU'RE NOT GONNA GO HOME THAT

1212
00:29:56,562 --> 00:29:57,163
NIGHT.

1213
00:29:57,163 --> 00:29:58,164
YOU'RE GONNA BE THERE, OKAY,

1214
00:29:58,164 --> 00:29:59,265
UNTIL YOU HAVE A BABY.

00:29:59,265 --> 00:29:59,932
>> OKAY.

1216
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:00,799

1217
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:01,467
>> YES.

1218
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:02,134
[laughter]

1219
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,102

00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:06,105
BYE-BYE.

1223
00:30:06,105 --> 00:30:06,805
>> BYE.

1224
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:07,506
THANK YOU.

1225
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:09,842
>> UH-HUH.

1226
00:30:09,842 --> 00:30:14,013
>> OH, JESUS.

1227
00:30:14,013 --> 00:30:15,481
IT'S NOT A LOT OF NOTICE, BUT

1228
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:17,216
KNOWING THAT I'M GETTING INDUCED

1229
00:30:17,216 --> 00:30:18,584
GIVES MY MOM A CHANCE TO GET

1230
00:30:18,584 --> 00:30:19,451
HERE FOR THE BIRTH.

1231
00:30:19,451 --> 00:30:21,253
ARE YOU GONNA BE ABLE TO COME?

1232
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,998
>> WHY NOT THOUGH?

1233
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,451
>> I WISH YOU COULD COME TOO.

1234
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:53,719
THAT, LIKE, UPSETS ME THAT

1235
00:30:53,719 --> 00:30:55,554
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE THERE.

1236
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,628
>> IT'S OKAY.

1237
00:31:08,634 --> 00:31:09,902
>> YEAH.

1238
00:31:09,902 --> 00:31:11,737
I HAVE TO GO NOW.

1239
00:31:14,941 --> 00:31:16,909
>> YEAH, I'M OKAY.

1240
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:25,084
OKAY, SO--

1241
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:27,153
>> OKAY.

1242
00:31:29,288 --> 00:31:31,958
>> OKAY.

1243
00:31:31,958 --> 00:31:33,960
>> BYE.

1244
00:31:46,005 --> 00:31:47,173
>> I'M TWO DAYS AWAY FROM BEING

1245
00:31:47,173 --> 00:31:48,941
INDUCED, AND JOEY'S MOM IS BACK

1246
00:31:48,941 --> 00:31:49,841
FROM DETOX.

1247
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:52,011
>> HEY, IT'S ABOUT TIME!

1248
00:31:52,011 --> 00:31:52,979
>> HEY, BABY.

1249
00:31:52,979 --> 00:31:53,679
>> HEY.

1250
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:54,413
>> HEY, ALLIE.

1251
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:55,347
>> HI.

1252
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:56,482
NOW THAT I KNOW MY MOM WON'T BE

1253
00:31:56,482 --> 00:31:58,250
THERE, I'M REALLY GOING TO NEED

1254
00:31:58,250 --> 00:31:59,785
SUPPORT FROM JOEY'S FAMILY.

1255
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:00,919
>> SO ARE YOU KIND OF SAD THAT

1256
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,121
SHE'S NOT COMING?

1257
00:32:02,121 --> 00:32:02,955
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

1258
00:32:02,955 --> 00:32:04,056
YOU GET THE CHEERLEADERS

1259
00:32:04,056 --> 00:32:04,923
OVER HERE.

1260
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:05,791
>> I WOULD BE SAD TOO.

1261
00:32:05,791 --> 00:32:07,626
>> YEAH, WELL, SHE'S GOT US.

1262
00:32:07,626 --> 00:32:08,594
SO SHE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY

1263
00:32:08,594 --> 00:32:09,228
ABOUT IT.

1264
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:10,462
I THINK IT'S NICE THAT EVERYBODY

1265
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:12,531
CAN GET ALONG NOW.

1266
00:32:12,531 --> 00:32:13,799
AND JUST--YOLANDA HAS TO CONTROL

1267
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,934
HER TEMPER, 'CAUSE A COUPLE OF

1268
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,703
MONTHS AGO IT WAS A DISASTER.

1269
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:19,138
I FEEL LIKE NOW IT'S

1270
00:32:19,138 --> 00:32:20,739
THE TIME JUST TO, YOU KNOW, JUST

1271
00:32:20,739 --> 00:32:21,940
PUT THAT IN THE PAST.

1272
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,575
KEEP GOING, BECAUSE NOW YOU'RE

1273
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:24,943
GONNA HAVE A GRANDCHILD.

1274
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:28,047
YOU KNOW, AND REGARDLESS OF WHAT

1275
00:32:28,047 --> 00:32:30,016
HAPPENED, YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALL A

1276
00:32:30,016 --> 00:32:31,050
FAMILY.

1277
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,284
AND IF FAMILY DOESN'T STICK

1278
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,553
TOGETHER, THEN WHO'S GONNA STICK

1279
00:32:34,553 --> 00:32:35,221
TOGETHER?

1280
00:32:35,221 --> 00:32:36,655
WHO'S GONNA DO IT IF IT'S NOT

1281
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:38,991
FAMILY?

1282
00:32:38,991 --> 00:32:40,326
>> JOEY'S MOM SEEMS EXCITED

1283
00:32:40,326 --> 00:32:41,860
ABOUT THE BABY COMING.

1284
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,295
AND SINCE SHE REALLY WANTS TO,

1285
00:32:43,295 --> 00:32:44,796
IT'S THE FIRST TIME I ACTUALLY

1286
00:32:44,796 --> 00:32:46,432
FEEL OKAY ABOUT HER BEING IN THE

1287
00:32:46,432 --> 00:32:49,768
DELIVERY ROOM.

1288
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:52,004
READY? COME ON.

1289
00:32:57,576 --> 00:32:58,610
>> NO.

1290
00:32:58,610 --> 00:32:59,945
I JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE.

1291
00:32:59,945 --> 00:33:00,946
>> YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE,

1292
00:33:00,946 --> 00:33:02,514
OKAY.

1293
00:33:02,514 --> 00:33:05,717
>> ARE YOU DILATED OR ANYTHING?

1294
00:33:05,717 --> 00:33:06,685
>> OH.

1295
00:33:06,685 --> 00:33:07,719
>> OKAY, WHEN YOU DO YOU THINK

1296
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:08,887
THE BABY IS GONNA COME?

1297
00:33:08,887 --> 00:33:11,123
>> I SAY PROBABLY NOON TOMORROW.

1298
00:33:11,123 --> 00:33:11,957
>> [gasps]

1299
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:12,624
OH, GOSH.

1300
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:13,459

00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:25,704
THE BABY.

1486
00:38:25,704 --> 00:38:27,473
AND I'M HAPPY TO SHOW HIM OFF.

1487
00:38:27,473 --> 00:38:28,306
WANT TO HOLD HIM?

1488
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:28,974
>> YES.

1489
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:31,510
>> GET HIS HEAD.

1490
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,011
YOU THINK HE LOOKS LIKE ME?

1491
00:38:33,011 --> 00:38:34,513
>> YEAH, HE HAS YOUR CHEEKS.

1492
00:38:34,513 --> 00:38:35,180
>> [crying]

1493
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,748
>> AW, WE GOT A CRYER.

1494
00:38:36,748 --> 00:38:39,150
>> OH, YEAH, HE'S A BIG CRYBABY.

1495
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,886
SHH, SHH, SHH.

1496
00:38:40,886 --> 00:38:41,887
>> HOW'S IT GONNA FEEL TO TAKE

1497
00:38:41,887 --> 00:38:42,988
HIM HOME?

1498
00:38:42,988 --> 00:38:44,556
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1499
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:46,024
I'M SCARED.

1500
00:38:46,024 --> 00:38:47,025
AT LEAST WE GET THE CHRISTMAS

1501
00:38:47,025 --> 00:38:47,993
BREAK OFF FOR ME TO PREPARE

1502
00:38:47,993 --> 00:38:49,094
MYSELF FOR WHEN WE HAVE TO BACK

1503
00:38:49,094 --> 00:38:50,195
TO SCHOOL.

1504
00:38:50,195 --> 00:38:51,162
>> WHAT DOES YOUR DAD THINK

1505
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:51,830
ABOUT THIS?

1506
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,732
DID HE SHOW UP, CALL, TEXT?

1507
00:38:53,732 --> 00:38:56,134
>> I JUST SENT HIM A PICTURE.

1508
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:57,002
>> DID HE REPLY BACK?

1509
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:58,169
>> HE'S LIKE, "SO YOU HAD THE

1510
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:58,937
BABY."

1511
00:38:58,937 --> 00:39:00,038
>> DO YOU THINK HE'S GONNA COME

1512
00:39:00,038 --> 00:39:00,706
SEE HIM?

1513
00:39:00,706 --> 00:39:01,707
>> HE DIDN'T ASK WHAT HOSPITAL

1514
00:39:01,707 --> 00:39:02,340
I'M AT.

1515
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,509
>> THAT'S MESSED UP.

1516
00:39:03,509 --> 00:39:04,242
>> YEAH.

1517
00:39:04,242 --> 00:39:05,043
>> THAT IS.

1518
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:06,311
HOW WAS YOUR LABOR?

1519
00:39:06,311 --> 00:39:07,479
LIKE, WHO ALL WAS THERE?

1520
00:39:07,479 --> 00:39:09,481
>> WELL, LIKE, HE WAS THERE, HIS

1521
00:39:09,481 --> 00:39:10,582
MOM.

1522
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:12,350
>> AFTER YOU TOLD ME A BILLION

1523
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,552
TIMES--

1524
00:39:13,552 --> 00:39:14,520
>> THAT SHE'S NOT GONNA BE

1525
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,120
THERE.

1526
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:15,754
>> YEAH.

1527
00:39:15,754 --> 00:39:16,688
>> SHE DIDN'T FLIP OUT OR

1528
00:39:16,688 --> 00:39:17,322
ANYTHING?

1529
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:18,624
>> SHE WAS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD.

1530
00:39:18,624 --> 00:39:20,726
SHE WAS QUIET, AND SHE WAS LIKE,

1531
00:39:20,726 --> 00:39:23,094
SUPPORTIVE OF MY LEFT LEG.

1532
00:39:23,094 --> 00:39:23,795
>> [laughs]

1533
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:26,031
>> SHE WAS GOOD.

1534
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:30,636
YOUR GRANDMA'S ON HER WAY UP.

1535
00:39:30,636 --> 00:39:32,738
>> I KNOW.

1536
00:39:32,738 --> 00:39:33,672
>> HOW DO Y'ALL FEEL ABOUT

1537
00:39:33,672 --> 00:39:34,940
TAKING THE BABY HOME?

1538
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,074
>> I'M SCARED.

1539
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:36,842
>> YOU'RE SCARED?

1540
00:39:36,842 --> 00:39:37,543
I'M SCARED.

1541
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:38,343
I'D BE SCARED TOO.

1542
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:39,244
>> YOU'RE SCARED FOR US?

1543
00:39:39,244 --> 00:39:40,979
>> NERVOUS.

1544
00:39:40,979 --> 00:39:42,714
>> I'M EXCITED AND NERVOUS TO

1545
00:39:42,714 --> 00:39:44,450
GO HOME, BECAUSE IT MEANS WE

1546
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:46,051
HAVE TO START DOING THIS ALL ON

1547
00:39:46,051 --> 00:39:46,718
OUR OWN.

1548
00:39:46,718 --> 00:39:48,219
>> ALL RIGHT, AYDENN.

1549
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,121
WELL, AT THE HOSPITAL YOU HAD

1550
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:51,222
THE NURSES.

1551
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,023
YOU HAD EVERYBODY.

1552
00:39:52,023 --> 00:39:54,660
NOW IT'S JUST Y'ALL.

1553
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,994
YOU TWO!

1554
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:57,629
>> IT'S GOING TO BE JUST THE TWO

1555
00:39:57,629 --> 00:39:59,064
OF US ONCE JOEY'S GRANDMA GOES

1556
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:00,098
BACK TO WORK.

1557
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:00,999
AND WE STILL HAVE A LOT

1558
00:40:00,999 --> 00:40:01,933
TO LEARN.

1559
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:02,634
IS HE HUNGRY?

1560
00:40:02,634 --> 00:40:03,602
DOES HE HAVE A WET DIAPER?

1561
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:04,335
>> [screaming]

1562
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:05,103
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1563
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:07,072
I HAVEN'T CHECKED HIS DIAPER.

1564
00:40:07,072 --> 00:40:09,174
HE SMELLS THOUGH.

1565
00:40:09,174 --> 00:40:11,910
OH, YEP.

1566
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:12,578
>> HELLO?

1567
00:40:12,578 --> 00:40:13,445
THAT'S WHY HE'S FUSSY.

1568
00:40:13,445 --> 00:40:14,546
DUDE, WHY ARE YOU JUST STARING

1569
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:16,448
AT IT?

1570
00:40:18,617 --> 00:40:19,851
>> DON'T BE SCARED TO WIPE,

1571
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:20,686
JOEY.

1572
00:40:20,686 --> 00:40:21,887
THE NURSES IN THE HOSPITAL MADE

1573
00:40:21,887 --> 00:40:23,555
LOOK IT SO EASY, BUT HE'S

1574
00:40:23,555 --> 00:40:24,490
SO LITTLE.

1575
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:25,524
I WORRY ABOUT DOING THE

1576
00:40:25,524 --> 00:40:26,692
WRONG THING.

1577
00:40:26,692 --> 00:40:28,093
I FEEL BAD.

1578
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:30,128
>> [screaming]

1579
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:31,429
>> I FEEL BAD.

1580
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:33,298
>> [screaming]

1581
00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:34,766
>> I DON'T WANT TO PUT HIM IN.

1582
00:40:34,766 --> 00:40:36,201
>> [screaming]

1583
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:37,168
>> I DON'T WANT TO TAKE HIM

1584
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:37,769
A BATH.

1585
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:40,438
CAN HE JUST STAY DIRTY?

1586
00:40:40,438 --> 00:40:43,308
>> [screaming and crying]

1587
00:40:43,308 --> 00:40:44,442
>> I KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE A

1588
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:45,677
LONG NIGHT WITH FEEDING AND

1589
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:47,479
DIAPER CHANGES.

1590
00:40:47,479 --> 00:40:48,647
JOEY SAID HE'D HELP OUT, BUT

1591
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:49,981
IT LOOKS LIKE HE HAS OTHER

1592
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:52,450
PLANS.

1593
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:55,253
[yawning]

1594
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:05,096
>> [fussing]

1595
00:41:05,096 --> 00:41:07,098
>> SHH.

1596
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,404
SHH.

1597
00:41:20,779 --> 00:41:22,113
AT LEAST ONE OF US GOT

1598
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:24,182
SOME SLEEP.

1599
00:41:31,957 --> 00:41:32,624
>> BE GOOD.

1600
00:41:32,624 --> 00:41:34,259
WITH JOEY BACK AT SCHOOL AND HIS

1601
00:41:34,259 --> 00:41:35,627
GRANDMA AT WORK, IT'S HARD

1602
00:41:35,627 --> 00:41:37,062
TAKING CARE OF AYDENN ALL DAY BY

1603
00:41:37,062 --> 00:41:38,063
MYSELF.

1604
00:41:38,063 --> 00:41:39,330
STAY RIGHT HERE.

1605
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:40,999
MY PLAN IS TO STAY AT HOME UNTIL

1606
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:42,500
THE BABY IS SIX WEEKS OLD.

1607
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,769
THEN I CAN GO BACK TO SCHOOL AND

1608
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:45,671
HE CAN GO TO DAY CARE, WHICH I

1609
00:41:45,671 --> 00:41:46,972
GET FOR FREE BECAUSE I'M A HIGH

1610
00:41:46,972 --> 00:41:49,040
SCHOOL STUDENT.

1611
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,508
BECAUSE JOEY HAS FOOTBALL AFTER

1612
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,010
SCHOOL, HE COMES HOME LATE A

1613
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,011
LOT.

1614
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,212
AFTER DOING HIS HOMEWORK, HE

1615
00:41:54,212 --> 00:41:55,480
DOESN'T SEEM INTERESTED IN

1616
00:41:55,480 --> 00:41:57,583
HELPING OUT WITH THE BABY.

1617
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:02,988
I KNOW YOU'RE HUNGRY.

1618
00:42:02,988 --> 00:42:04,823
YOU PROBABLY HAVE A WET DIAPER.

1619
00:42:04,823 --> 00:42:06,491
BEING AT HOME ALL DAY, I MISS MY

1620
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:08,126
FRIENDS, SO IT'S NICE WHEN WE

1621
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:09,728
CAN MEET UP AFTER SCHOOL.

1622
00:42:09,728 --> 00:42:11,262
YOU'RE THE BEST.

1623
00:42:11,262 --> 00:42:12,731
I'M GONNA GO UP THIS LITTLE RAMP

1624
00:42:12,731 --> 00:42:13,932
THING, OKAY?

1625
00:42:13,932 --> 00:42:15,100
WOW.

1626
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:15,767
HE'S THERE.

1627
00:42:15,767 --> 00:42:16,902
NO, HE'S WAITING FOR ME TO OPEN

1628
00:42:16,902 --> 00:42:17,502
THE DOOR.

1629
00:42:17,502 --> 00:42:18,269
I HAVE THE KEY.

1630
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:19,037
HE DOESN'T.

1631
00:42:19,037 --> 00:42:20,238
I WISH I COULD SAY JOEY IS

1632
00:42:20,238 --> 00:42:21,573
HELPING OUT MORE, BUT THAT'S NOT

1633
00:42:21,573 --> 00:42:22,608
THE CASE.

1634
00:42:22,608 --> 00:42:24,509
OH, I'LL GET HIM.

1635
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:33,151
HE HASN'T BEEN HELPING A LOT.

1636
00:42:33,151 --> 00:42:34,419
HE'S PISSING ME OFF, REALLY,

1637
00:42:34,419 --> 00:42:35,821
'CAUSE HE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING.

1638
00:42:35,821 --> 00:42:37,522
IF I ASK HIM, HE GIVES ME A HARD

1639
00:42:37,522 --> 00:42:38,957
TIME, BUT HE STILL DOES IT.

1640
00:42:38,957 --> 00:42:40,692
BUT I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO ASK.

1641
00:42:40,692 --> 00:42:42,928
IT'S LITTLE THINGS, BUT WHEN

1642
00:42:42,928 --> 00:42:43,962
SOMEONE DOES SOMETHING LITTLE

1643
00:42:43,962 --> 00:42:45,296
TOO MUCH, THAT'S WHEN IT STARTS

1644
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:46,131
TO TURN, LIKE, BIG.

1645
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:46,898
LIKE, "COME ON."

1646
00:42:46,898 --> 00:42:47,532
>> YEAH.

1647
00:42:47,532 --> 00:42:48,466
>> HE'S NOT READY FOR THE

1648
00:42:48,466 --> 00:42:49,434
RESPONSIBILITY, AND IT'S A

1649
00:42:49,434 --> 00:42:51,336
LITTLE LATE TO NOT BE READY,

1650
00:42:51,336 --> 00:42:52,270
'CAUSE HE'S ALREADY HERE.

1651
00:42:52,270 --> 00:42:53,104
LIKE, IF HE CAN'T BE

1652
00:42:53,104 --> 00:42:54,172
RESPONSIBLE, I DON'T WANT TO

1653
00:42:54,172 --> 00:42:55,106
BE WITH SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT

1654
00:42:55,106 --> 00:42:56,141
RESPONSIBLE.

1655
00:42:56,141 --> 00:42:57,242
>> WOULD YOU GO TO JERSEY IF IT

1656
00:42:57,242 --> 00:42:58,176
DIDN'T WORK OUT?

1657
00:42:58,176 --> 00:42:59,778
>> I DON'T WANT THAT TO HAPPEN.

1658
00:42:59,778 --> 00:43:00,779
LET ME SEE HOW HE ACTS WHILE I

1659
00:43:00,779 --> 00:43:01,947
GO BACK TO SCHOOL.

1660
00:43:01,947 --> 00:43:03,081
LIKE, HE'S USING THE EXCUSE.

1661
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:03,982
"I GOT TO DO SCHOOLWORK.

1662
00:43:03,982 --> 00:43:04,950
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING."

1663
00:43:04,950 --> 00:43:06,184
AND I TELL HIM, "WHAT ABOUT WHEN

1664
00:43:06,184 --> 00:43:07,085
I GO BACK TO SCHOOL?"

1665
00:43:07,085 --> 00:43:08,519
HE'S LIKE, "I GUESS I'LL HELP

1666
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:10,622
AT NIGHT."

1667
00:43:10,622 --> 00:43:11,957
>> LIKE, "YOU GUESS?"

1668
00:43:11,957 --> 00:43:13,024
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN,

1669
00:43:13,024 --> 00:43:13,792
"YOU GUESS"?

1670
00:43:13,792 --> 00:43:15,794
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

1671
00:43:15,794 --> 00:43:18,029
I FEEL CONFUSED AND FRUSTRATED.

1672
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:19,530
I HOPE WHEN MY MOM GETS HERE SHE

1673
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:22,734
CAN HELP ME FIGURE THINGS OUT.

1674
00:43:22,734 --> 00:43:24,402
MY MOM'S WEEKEND VISIT IS

1675
00:43:24,402 --> 00:43:26,571
FINALLY HERE, AND JOEY'S PARENTS

1676
00:43:26,571 --> 00:43:27,839
ARE TAKING ME TO THE AIRPORT

1677
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:29,574
WHILE HE'S IN SCHOOL.

1678
00:43:29,574 --> 00:43:31,209
OH, HER PLANE JUST LANDED.

1679
00:43:31,209 --> 00:43:32,277
>> TELL HER TO WAIT AT THE GATE,

1680
00:43:32,277 --> 00:43:33,278
NOT TO MOVE.

1681
00:43:33,278 --> 00:43:34,612
WE HAVEN'T SEEN EACH OTHER FOR

1682
00:43:34,612 --> 00:43:35,580
A YEAR.

1683
00:43:35,580 --> 00:43:37,048
NOW THAT I'M A MOM, I'M

1684
00:43:37,048 --> 00:43:38,549
REALIZING HOW MUCH I NEED MY

1685
00:43:38,549 --> 00:43:39,985
MOM'S HELP AND ADVICE.

1686
00:43:39,985 --> 00:43:42,688
READY TO SEE GRANDMA?

1687
00:43:42,688 --> 00:43:43,354

1692
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:13,318
HE'S SO TINY.

1693
00:44:13,318 --> 00:44:16,087
HI, AYDENN!

1694
00:44:16,087 --> 00:44:17,856
HI.

YOU ARE SO ADORABLE.

1696
00:44:21,459 --> 00:44:23,261

1698
00:44:24,462 --> 00:44:25,496
I ALMOST FORGOT.

1699

00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:31,102
>> HI, YOLANDA, IT'S SO NICE TO

1701
00:44:31,102 --> 00:44:31,803
MEET YOU.

1702
00:44:31,803 --> 00:44:32,637
>> NICE TO MEET YOU.

1703

00:44:33,371 --> 00:44:34,773
HI, HI, HI, HI.

1705
00:44:34,773 --> 00:44:35,974
>> HOW WAS YOUR FLIGHT?

1706
00:44:35,974 --> 00:44:37,275
>> IT WAS A REALLY GOOD FLIGHT.

1707
00:44:37,275 --> 00:44:38,543
IT REALLY WAS, YEAH.

1708
00:44:38,543 --> 00:44:39,310
>> THAT WAS GOOD.

1709
00:44:39,310 --> 00:44:40,045
THAT WAS GOOD.

1710
00:44:40,045 --> 00:44:40,979
>> YOU'LL HAVE YOUR BAG IN

1711
00:44:40,979 --> 00:44:41,612
A MINUTE.

1712
00:44:41,612 --> 00:44:42,647
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME MY MOM IS

1713
00:44:42,647 --> 00:44:44,649
MEETING JOEY.

1714
00:44:44,649 --> 00:44:46,417
>> IT'S SO NICE TO MEET YOU.

1715
00:44:46,417 --> 00:44:48,153
YOU'RE SO CUTE!

1716
00:44:48,153 --> 00:44:48,887
>> THANK YOU.

1717

>> HE JUST BURPED.

1723
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:00,531
IT'S NICE THAT MY MOM IS FINALLY

1724
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,267
ABLE TO MEET EVERYONE, BUT SHE

1725
00:45:02,267 --> 00:45:03,268
SEEMS MORE FOCUSED ON

1726
00:45:03,268 --> 00:45:04,602
FIGURING OUT WHAT'S GOING ON

1727
00:45:04,602 --> 00:45:05,703
WITH JOEY.

1728
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,138
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO, OR

1729
00:45:07,138 --> 00:45:10,742
WHAT WOULD YOU SETTLE TO DO?

00:45:10,742 --> 00:45:11,810
>> PROBABLY LIKE FAST FOOD OR

1731
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:12,610
SOMETHING.

00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:13,912
[laughs]

1733
00:45:13,912 --> 00:45:14,780
I'M CONFUSED.

1734
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:16,281
I CHANGE MY CAREER LIKE ALMOST

1735
00:45:16,281 --> 00:45:17,082
EVERY WEEK.

1736
00:45:17,082 --> 00:45:17,916
JUST ASK HER.

1737
00:45:17,916 --> 00:45:18,917
LIKE, ONE WEEK I WANT TO BE A

1738
00:45:18,917 --> 00:45:19,517
LAWYER.

1739
00:45:19,517 --> 00:45:20,551
ONE WEEK I WANT TO BE A NURSE.

1740
00:45:20,551 --> 00:45:22,620
ONE WEEK I WANT TO BE--

1741
00:45:22,620 --> 00:45:23,755
>> JUST DO WHAT YOU WANT TO DO.

1742
00:45:23,755 --> 00:45:24,622
'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T--

1743
00:45:24,622 --> 00:45:25,723
>> I STILL WANT TO GET A DEGREE

1744
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:26,324
THOUGH.

1745
00:45:26,324 --> 00:45:27,258
>> YOU CAN STILL DO THAT.

1746
00:45:27,258 --> 00:45:30,295
>> GRADUATE AND GET A DEGREE.

1747
00:45:30,295 --> 00:45:31,462
>> HI.

1748
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:32,397
THIS IS MY MOM.

00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:33,064
>> HI!

1753
00:45:37,235 --> 00:45:37,936
GRANDBABY?

1754
00:45:37,936 --> 00:45:38,736
>> HE'S BEAUTIFUL.

1755
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:39,905
>> ISN'T HE?

1756
00:45:39,905 --> 00:45:41,139
HE JUST ATE, HUH?

1757
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:42,808
>> YEAH, HE ATE AT 4:00.

1758
00:45:42,808 --> 00:45:43,975
>> HE DID POOP, THOUGH, I THINK.

1759
00:45:43,975 --> 00:45:45,543
>> OH, HE POOPED?

1760
00:45:45,543 --> 00:45:47,345
WHY DIDN'T YOU CHANGE IT?

1761
00:45:47,345 --> 00:45:49,447
>> OH, MY BABY.

1762
00:45:49,447 --> 00:45:50,115
HE POOPED?

1763
00:45:50,115 --> 00:45:51,716
NO WONDER HE'S CRYING.

1764
00:45:51,716 --> 00:45:52,617
>> JOEY KNEW HE POOPED.

1765
00:45:52,617 --> 00:45:53,351
I DIDN'T KNOW.

1766
00:45:53,351 --> 00:45:54,385
>> WELL, HOW COME YOU HAVE HIM

1767
00:45:54,385 --> 00:45:55,053
LIKE THAT?

1768
00:45:55,053 --> 00:45:55,887
YOU KNOW HE'S CRYING

1769
00:45:55,887 --> 00:45:56,721
'CAUSE HE'S POOPED.

1770
00:45:56,721 --> 00:45:57,688
>> I SAID HE SMELLED LIKE A

1771
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:58,356
WHILE AGO.

1772
00:45:58,356 --> 00:45:59,357
>> THEN WHY DIDN'T YOU CHANGE

1773
00:45:59,357 --> 00:46:00,125
HIM A WHILE AGO?

1774
00:46:00,125 --> 00:46:01,159
>> YEAH!

1775
00:46:01,159 --> 00:46:02,760
>> GOING TO CHANGE HIM.

1776
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,862
IT REALLY SUCKS THAT JOEY CAN'T

1777
00:46:03,862 --> 00:46:05,797
FIGURE OUT HOW TO BE A PARENT.

1778
00:46:05,797 --> 00:46:07,432
AND I KNOW MY MOM IS GOING TO

1779
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:08,266
WANT TO TALK ABOUT

1780
00:46:08,266 --> 00:46:09,600
THE SITUATION.

1781
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:11,069
>> HOW DO YOU FEEL THOUGH?

1782
00:46:11,069 --> 00:46:12,703
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1783
00:46:12,703 --> 00:46:16,441
>> HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT JOEY?

1784
00:46:16,441 --> 00:46:19,044
>> LIKE, I LOVE HIM, OBVIOUSLY.

1785
00:46:19,044 --> 00:46:19,777
I DON'T KNOW--

1786
00:46:19,777 --> 00:46:20,745
>> DO YOU REALLY?

1787
00:46:20,745 --> 00:46:21,880
WOULD YOU BE WITH HIM NOW IF IT

1788
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:25,450
WASN'T FOR HIM?

1789
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:26,251
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1790
00:46:26,251 --> 00:46:27,152
>> OKAY, YOU ANSWERED MY

1791
00:46:27,152 --> 00:46:28,987
QUESTION.

1792
00:46:28,987 --> 00:46:30,856
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1793
00:46:30,856 --> 00:46:32,057
I MEAN, AYDENN'S ONLY A MONTH

1794
00:46:32,057 --> 00:46:33,291
OLD, AND I'M ALREADY GETTING

1795
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:36,327
SICK OF HIS STUPID EXCUSES.

1796
00:46:36,327 --> 00:46:38,163
>> WELL, WHAT ARE HIS EXCUSES?

1797
00:46:38,163 --> 00:46:39,397
>> ANYTIME HE DOES SOMETHING FOR

1798
00:46:39,397 --> 00:46:41,332
AYDENN, IT'S 'CAUSE I ASKED.

1799
00:46:41,332 --> 00:46:42,533
>> BUT OTHERWISE HE JUST DOESN'T

1800
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:43,969
DO ANYTHING?

1801
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:45,203
>> NOT REALLY.

1802
00:46:45,203 --> 00:46:46,371
>> FOR YOU TO FEEL LIKE THAT,

1803
00:46:46,371 --> 00:46:47,538
IT'S JUST GONNA BE A MATTER OF

1804
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:48,773
TIME BEFORE YOU'RE JUST GONNA

1805
00:46:48,773 --> 00:46:49,841
SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT?

1806
00:46:49,841 --> 00:46:51,843
I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE."

1807
00:46:51,843 --> 00:46:53,678
>> I THINK MYSELF STUCK IN TEXAS

1808
00:46:53,678 --> 00:46:55,246
FOR A WHILE.

1809
00:46:55,246 --> 00:46:56,747
>> YOU KNOW YOU'RE NOT STUCK

1810
00:46:56,747 --> 00:46:58,049
IN TEXAS.

1811
00:46:58,049 --> 00:47:00,485
IF YOU'RE THAT UNHAPPY, WE CAN

1812
00:47:00,485 --> 00:47:03,221
HAVE YOU HOME WITHIN 24 HOURS.

1813
00:47:03,221 --> 00:47:05,256
>> DO YOU THINK ME AND JOEY WILL

1814
00:47:05,256 --> 00:47:06,191
STAY TOGETHER?

1815
00:47:06,191 --> 00:47:07,458
>> HONESTLY, NO.

1816
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:08,493
>> WELL, HOW LONG DO YOU THINK

1817
00:47:08,493 --> 00:47:09,394
WE'LL MAKE IT THEN?

1818
00:47:09,394 --> 00:47:10,828
>> I THINK YOU KNOW.

1819
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:12,163
I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT THE END

1820
00:47:12,163 --> 00:47:12,998
RESULT IS GONNA BE.

1821
00:47:12,998 --> 00:47:14,232
IT'S IN YOUR HEAD.

1822
00:47:14,232 --> 00:47:16,101
THERE'S STILL THAT PERCENTAGE

1823
00:47:16,101 --> 00:47:18,836
WHERE I COULD BE WRONG.

1824
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:20,205
I DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING.

1825
00:47:20,205 --> 00:47:22,040
BUT BECAUSE OF HOW THINGS ARE

1826
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:24,876
AND BECAUSE YOU REALLY HAVEN'T

1827
00:47:24,876 --> 00:47:26,177
STARTED TO...

1828
00:47:26,177 --> 00:47:27,012
>> LIVE?

1829
00:47:27,012 --> 00:47:27,678
>> LIVE.

1830
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:28,346
>> YEAH.

1831
00:47:28,346 --> 00:47:30,515
>> HONESTLY, I THINK JOEY'S VERY

1832
00:47:30,515 --> 00:47:31,582
SWEET.

1833
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:32,450
I THINK HIS FAMILY IS

1834
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:33,551
VERY SWEET.

1835
00:47:33,551 --> 00:47:35,553
BUT I THINK YOU'RE GONNA BE SO

1836
00:47:35,553 --> 00:47:38,089
FRUSTRATED AND DONE WITH IT.

1837
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:40,125
I THINK IN SIX MONTHS YOU'RE

1838
00:47:40,125 --> 00:47:41,692
GONNA BE GOING INSANE.

1839
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:42,460
[chime dings]

1840
00:47:42,460 --> 00:47:43,561
>> MY MOM IS MAKING A LOT

1841
00:47:43,561 --> 00:47:45,096
OF SENSE.

1842
00:47:45,096 --> 00:47:46,197
THE WHOLE REASON FOR STAYING IN

1843
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:47,798
TEXAS WAS TO RAISE THE BABY

1844
00:47:47,798 --> 00:47:48,900
WITH JOEY.

1845
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,701
BUT IF HE'S NOT GOING TO STEP UP

1846
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,971
AND BE A DAD, THEN I'M NOT SURE

1847
00:47:52,971 --> 00:47:54,872
WHILE I'M STILL HERE.

1848
00:47:59,844 --> 00:48:00,979
>> ALL RIGHT, BYE.

1849
00:48:00,979 --> 00:48:02,647
>> AW, BYE.

1850
00:48:02,647 --> 00:48:03,915
>> MY MOM COULD ONLY COME FOR

00:48:03,915 --> 00:48:05,783
THE WEEKEND BECAUSE OF WORK, BUT

1852
00:48:05,783 --> 00:48:06,952
I WISH SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO LEAVE

1853
00:48:06,952 --> 00:48:09,520
SO SOON.

1854
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:11,222
>> MY MAKEUP FEELS SMUDGED

1855
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:11,990
AGAIN.

1856
00:48:11,990 --> 00:48:12,757
>> A LITTLE.

1857
00:48:12,757 --> 00:48:14,192
>> I REALLY WANT YOU TO COME...

1858
00:48:14,192 --> 00:48:14,926
>> TO JERSEY?

1859
00:48:14,926 --> 00:48:15,626
>> TO JERSEY.

1860
00:48:15,626 --> 00:48:16,962
WE'RE WAITING FOR YOU.

1861
00:48:16,962 --> 00:48:17,628
>> OKAY.

1862
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:18,763
JUST A PHONE CALL AWAY.

1863
00:48:18,763 --> 00:48:21,066
BYE.

1864
00:48:21,066 --> 00:48:22,400
>> I LOVE HAVING HER HERE, AND

1865
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,868
SHE'S THE ONE PERSON WHO

1866
00:48:23,868 --> 00:48:25,270
UNDERSTANDS ME.

1867
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:26,404
IT'S HARDER THAN EVER TO SAY

1868
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:27,872
GOOD-BYE WHEN THINGS ARE SO UP

1869
00:48:27,872 --> 00:48:30,041
IN THE AIR.

1870
00:48:34,145 --> 00:48:35,580
IT'S BEEN SIX WEEK SINCE I'VE

1871
00:48:35,580 --> 00:48:36,614
HAD THE BABY,

1872
00:48:36,614 --> 00:48:37,815
AND IT'S TIME FOR ME TO GO BACK

1873
00:48:37,815 --> 00:48:38,683
TO SCHOOL.

1874
00:48:38,683 --> 00:48:39,951
SO IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER

1875
00:48:39,951 --> 00:48:41,686
THAT JOEY STEPS UP AND HELPS ME

1876
00:48:41,686 --> 00:48:42,920
TAKE CARE OF AYDENN.

1877
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,289
ARE YOU GONNA HELP ME TONIGHT,

1878
00:48:44,289 --> 00:48:45,623
SINCE I GO TO SCHOOL?

1879
00:48:45,623 --> 00:48:47,192
>> WAKE ME UP.

1880
00:48:47,192 --> 00:48:50,261
>> NO!

1881
00:48:50,261 --> 00:48:51,629
WAKE YOURSELF UP.

1882
00:48:51,629 --> 00:48:53,098
EVEN LIKE WHEN I'M HERE WITHOUT

1883
00:48:53,098 --> 00:48:54,499
SCHOOL, I ONLY GET A LITTLE BIT

1884
00:48:54,499 --> 00:48:55,166
OF SLEEP.

1885
00:48:55,166 --> 00:48:56,334
BUT AT LEAST I CAN TAKE A RANDOM

1886
00:48:56,334 --> 00:48:57,702
NAP DURING THE DAY.

1887
00:48:57,702 --> 00:48:59,170
I CAN'T DO THAT NOW, 'CAUSE

1888
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:00,071
I HAVE TO GO TO SCHOOL.

1889
00:49:00,071 --> 00:49:02,673
SO I NEED YOUR HELP MORE.

1890
00:49:02,673 --> 00:49:03,808
THAT WAY WE BOTH GET THE SAME

1891
00:49:03,808 --> 00:49:04,809
AMOUNT OF SLEEP.

1892
00:49:04,809 --> 00:49:05,810
>> I HELP YOU.

1893
00:49:05,810 --> 00:49:07,512
I FEED HIM, CHANGE HIM.

1894
00:49:07,512 --> 00:49:08,446
>> NO, YOU DON'T.

1895
00:49:08,446 --> 00:49:09,680
>> YES, I DO.

1896
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,082
>> YOU DON'T CHANGE HIM.

1897
00:49:11,082 --> 00:49:12,050
>> I CHANGE--WELL, I CHANGE

1898
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:13,018
HIS DIAPER.

1899
00:49:13,018 --> 00:49:13,951
>> NO, YOU DON'T.

1900
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:15,020
>> YES, I DO.

1901
00:49:15,020 --> 00:49:16,421
>> WHEN?

1902
00:49:16,421 --> 00:49:17,488
>> SOME--AT TIMES.

1903
00:49:17,488 --> 00:49:18,723
>> WHEN?

1904
00:49:18,723 --> 00:49:19,524
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1905
00:49:19,524 --> 00:49:21,626
>> WHY DON'T YOU BURP HIM?

1906
00:49:21,626 --> 00:49:22,960
>> [fussing]

1907
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:27,365
>> THANKS SO MUCH.

1908
00:49:27,365 --> 00:49:30,435
HI, BABY.

1909
00:49:30,435 --> 00:49:32,303
HERE.

1910
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:33,271
I THINK WE SHOULD JUST KEEP

1911
00:49:33,271 --> 00:49:34,239
TAKING TURNS WHEN IT'S TIME

1912
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:35,840
FOR FEEDING.

1913
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:36,907
AND I DON'T ALWAYS GET

1914
00:49:36,907 --> 00:49:39,144
THE 3:00 A.M., OKAY?

1915
00:49:39,144 --> 00:49:40,478
>> OKAY.

1916
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:42,647
IT SOUNDS GOOD.

1917
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:43,648
>> [cooing]

1918
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:44,782
>> WHY DO YOU LOOK AT ME WHEN HE

1919
00:49:44,782 --> 00:49:45,916
DOES THAT?

1920
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:46,884
SOMETIMES YOU GET HOME, AND

1921
00:49:46,884 --> 00:49:48,886
YOU'RE LIKE...

1922
00:49:48,886 --> 00:49:49,987
SO ARE YOU REALLY GONNA BE ABLE

1923
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,022
TO HELP? REALLY?

1924
00:49:51,022 --> 00:49:54,025
>> I'M GONNA HAVE TO, LIKE, PUSH

1925
00:49:54,025 --> 00:49:55,860
MYSELF TO DO IT.

1926
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:56,727
>> ARE YOU GOING TO?

1927
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:58,663
>> I AM GOING TO.

1928
00:49:58,663 --> 00:49:59,697
>> OKAY.

1929
00:49:59,697 --> 00:50:01,932
I BELIEVE YOU.

1930
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:04,135
I'M NOT GONNA FAIL THIS YEAR.

1931
00:50:04,135 --> 00:50:05,103
YOU SWEAR?

1932
00:50:05,103 --> 00:50:06,771
>> I SWEAR.

1933
00:50:06,771 --> 00:50:10,108
[alarm droning]

1934
00:50:10,108 --> 00:50:11,309
>> IT'S MY FIRST DAY BACK AT

1935
00:50:11,309 --> 00:50:12,277
SCHOOL.

1936
00:50:12,277 --> 00:50:13,444
I USED TO GET UP EARLY TO GET

1937
00:50:13,444 --> 00:50:15,280
MYSELF READY, BUT NOW I HAVE TO

1938
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:16,647
GET AYDENN READY FOR DAY CARE.

1939
00:50:16,647 --> 00:50:18,283
>> SORRY, BABY.

1940
00:50:18,283 --> 00:50:19,150
>> [fussing]

1941
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:20,885
>> HE'S SO FUSSY.

1942
00:50:20,885 --> 00:50:22,087
>> IT'S 'CAUSE HE JUST FINISHED

1943
00:50:22,087 --> 00:50:23,721
EATING AT, LIKE, 4:45.

1944
00:50:23,721 --> 00:50:24,589
>> OH, HE DID?

1945
00:50:24,589 --> 00:50:26,457
>> YEAH.

1946
00:50:26,457 --> 00:50:27,392
>> YOU'RE GETTING DRESSED

1947
00:50:27,392 --> 00:50:28,025
ALREADY?

1948
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,127
>> YEAH, I'M GONNA GET DRESSED,

1949
00:50:29,127 --> 00:50:29,760
BECAUSE--

1950
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:30,761
>> LET ME FINISH DRESSING HIM,

1951
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:31,596
AND YOU GET DRESSED.

1952
00:50:31,596 --> 00:50:32,763
>> OKAY.

1953
00:50:32,763 --> 00:50:34,432
IT'S ONLY A DAY AFTER OUR TALK,

1954
00:50:34,432 --> 00:50:36,301
AND JOEY IS ALREADY FORGETTING

1955
00:50:36,301 --> 00:50:37,735
THAT HE PROMISED TO HELP.

1956
00:50:37,735 --> 00:50:38,969
>> OH, YOU'RE NOT GETTING READY?

1957
00:50:38,969 --> 00:50:40,338
>> I AM, BUT LOOK--I HAVE TO

1958
00:50:40,338 --> 00:50:41,439
FINISH HIS STUFF BEFORE I EVEN

1959
00:50:41,439 --> 00:50:42,607
TOUCH MYSELF.

1960
00:50:42,607 --> 00:50:44,242
WE HAVE TO GO NOW, JOEY.

1961
00:50:44,242 --> 00:50:44,909
COME ON.

1962
00:50:44,909 --> 00:50:46,010
I'M NOT GONNA BE LATE TO SCHOOL

1963
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:46,611
EITHER.

1964
00:50:46,611 --> 00:50:50,981
GO.

1965
00:50:50,981 --> 00:50:51,982
IT'S FUN BEING WITH ALL MY

1966
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:53,518
FRIENDS AGAIN, BUT GETTING BACK

1967
00:50:53,518 --> 00:50:54,785
INTO THE SWING OF THINGS AT

1968
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:55,986
SCHOOL IS HARD.

1969
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:57,255
AND SO IS BEING AWAY FROM AYDENN

1970
00:50:57,255 --> 00:50:58,323
ALL DAY.

1971
00:50:58,323 --> 00:50:59,657
ONCE I PICK HIM UP FROM DAY

1972
00:50:59,657 --> 00:51:01,126
CARE, I HAVE HOURS OF HOMEWORK

1973
00:51:01,126 --> 00:51:02,227
TO DO.

1974
00:51:02,227 --> 00:51:03,461
AND IF JOEY'S STILL AT PRACTICE,

1975
00:51:03,461 --> 00:51:04,562
THERE'S NO ONE TO WATCH THE

1976
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:06,764
BABY.

1977
00:51:06,764 --> 00:51:08,299
>> [gurgling]

1978
00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:11,769
>> OH, GOD.

1979
00:51:11,769 --> 00:51:12,903
IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH KEEPING

1980
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,272
UP WITH SCHOOL IF I'M THE ONLY

1981
00:51:14,272 --> 00:51:15,473
ONE PARENTING.

1982
00:51:15,473 --> 00:51:17,074
SO I DECIDED TO TALK TO JOEY'S

1983
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:18,008
GRANDMA WHEN SHE GOT HOME

1984
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:18,909
FROM WORK.

1985
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,578
>> I UNDERSTAND IT'S FRUSTRATING

1986
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:21,612
HE DON'T WANT TO CHANGE, HE

1987
00:51:21,612 --> 00:51:22,413
DON'T WANT TO DO.

1988
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:23,914
BUT IT'S JUST--THAT IS PART OF

1989
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,383
BEING A PARENT.

1990
00:51:25,383 --> 00:51:26,484
>> I DIDN'T KNOW I'D HAVE TO DO

1991
00:51:26,484 --> 00:51:29,086
IT LIKE 24-7 BY MYSELF.

1992
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,421
>> I THINK THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

1993
00:51:30,421 --> 00:51:31,088
>> HUH?

1994
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:32,190
>> I THINK YOU HAVE TO ADAPT TO

1995
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:33,258
BEING A MOTHER.

1996
00:51:33,258 --> 00:51:34,225
HE'S GONNA HAVE TO ADAPT TO

1997
00:51:34,225 --> 00:51:35,660
BEING A FATHER, AND IN BETWEEN,

1998
00:51:35,660 --> 00:51:36,661
Y'ALL ARE GONNA HAVE TO ADAPT

1999
00:51:36,661 --> 00:51:38,463
TOGETHER IN THE RELATIONSHIP.

2000
00:51:38,463 --> 00:51:40,798
'CAUSE AT FIRST IT WAS ALL CUTE.

2001
00:51:40,798 --> 00:51:41,966
"OOH, I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE BABY

2002
00:51:41,966 --> 00:51:42,667
TO GET HERE."

2003
00:51:42,667 --> 00:51:43,634
DIDN'T Y'ALL JUST SAY, "OOH,

2004
00:51:43,634 --> 00:51:44,569
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE HIM."

2005
00:51:44,569 --> 00:51:45,836
AND NOW?

2006
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:46,804
"UGH."

2007
00:51:46,804 --> 00:51:48,306
>> IF I'M LIKE, "CAN YOU JUST

2008
00:51:48,306 --> 00:51:49,340
HOLD HIM REAL QUICK?" HE'S LIKE,

2009
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:50,040
"OH, MY GOD.

2010
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:50,608
WHY?"

2011
00:51:50,608 --> 00:51:51,609
WHEN HE SAYS STUFF LIKE THAT,

2012
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:52,877
I'M LIKE, "OH, MY GOSH."

2013
00:51:52,877 --> 00:51:53,844
>> YOU AND JOEY WERE BARELY

2014
00:51:53,844 --> 00:51:56,113
DATING, BARELY BEGUN DATING

2015
00:51:56,113 --> 00:51:57,348
WHEN YOU BECAME PREGNANT.

2016
00:51:57,348 --> 00:51:58,649
THAT'S ANOTHER BIG MISTAKE,

2017
00:51:58,649 --> 00:52:00,485
BECAUSE YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW

2018
00:52:00,485 --> 00:52:02,052
WHERE YOUR RELATIONSHIP--WHERE

2019
00:52:02,052 --> 00:52:02,953
IT'S AT.

2020
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:03,954
YOU KNOW, AND THEN YOU BRING A

2021
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,055
BABY IN THE WORLD.

2022
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:06,191
Y'ALL ARE BOTH FRUSTRATED,

2023
00:52:06,191 --> 00:52:07,558
BECAUSE YOU WEREN'T PREPARED TO

2024
00:52:07,558 --> 00:52:09,260
WHAT WAS GONNA COME.

2025
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,561
AND WITH BOTH OF YOU FRUSTRATED,

2026
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:11,462
IT'S NOT GONNA WORK IN A

2027
00:52:11,462 --> 00:52:12,163
RELATIONSHIP.

2028
00:52:12,163 --> 00:52:13,564
THAT WILL NOT WORK.

2029
00:52:13,564 --> 00:52:15,466
SO YOU'RE FRUSTRATED AT HIM, AND

2030
00:52:15,466 --> 00:52:17,802
HE'S FRUSTRATED WITH YOU.

2031
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:19,804
RAISING A CHILD IS NOT EASY.

2032
00:52:19,804 --> 00:52:20,938
IT'S NOT EASY.

2033
00:52:20,938 --> 00:52:22,740
SO IF YOU FEEL LIKE YOU AND JOEY

2034
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:24,409
ARE NOT GETTING ALONG, THEN

2035
00:52:24,409 --> 00:52:25,443
Y'ALL NEED TO TALK ABOUT IT,

2036
00:52:25,443 --> 00:52:27,144
'CAUSE OTHERWISE, IT AIN'T

2037
00:52:27,144 --> 00:52:32,583
GONNA LAST.

2038
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:34,285
>> JOEY'S GRANDMA IS RIGHT.

2039
00:52:34,285 --> 00:52:37,788
I HAVE TO TELL HIM HOW I FEEL.

2040
00:52:37,788 --> 00:52:38,856
HOW COME WHEN I ASK YOU TO DO

2041
00:52:38,856 --> 00:52:40,558
SOMETHING, YOU COMPLAIN, OR YOU

2042
00:52:40,558 --> 00:52:45,696
JUST DON'T DO IT FOR HIM?

2043
00:52:45,696 --> 00:52:47,064
>> I DON'T KNOW.

2044
00:52:47,064 --> 00:52:48,233
>> LOOK, I KNOW YOU LOVE HIM AND

2045
00:52:48,233 --> 00:52:49,634
ALL, BUT YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO

2046
00:52:49,634 --> 00:52:51,802
DO THE DIRTY WORK.

2047
00:52:51,802 --> 00:52:52,803
>> TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH, I'M

2048
00:52:52,803 --> 00:52:54,038
KIND OF LAZY.

2049
00:52:54,038 --> 00:52:55,072
>> THAT'S YOUR EXCUSE?

2050
00:52:55,072 --> 00:52:55,840
YOU'RE LAZY?

2051
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:57,908
I'M LAZY TOO.

2052
00:52:57,908 --> 00:52:59,444
BUT I GET MY ASS UP, BECAUSE I

2053
00:52:59,444 --> 00:53:00,378
DON'T WANT ANYTHING BAD TO

2054
00:53:00,378 --> 00:53:01,111
HAPPEN TO HIM.

2055
00:53:01,111 --> 00:53:02,079
YOU DON'T CARE.

2056
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,348
LIKE, YOU LET HIM SIT IN THIS

2057
00:53:03,348 --> 00:53:04,882
DISGUSTING DIAPER UNTIL SOMEONE

2058
00:53:04,882 --> 00:53:06,284
TELLS YOU TO CHANGE HIM.

2059
00:53:06,284 --> 00:53:07,017
>> NO, I DON'T.

2060
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,219
I JUST FORGET.

2061
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:09,254
>> HOW DO YOU FORGET?

2062
00:53:09,254 --> 00:53:10,321
>> MOST OF THE TIME IT'S BECAUSE

2063
00:53:10,321 --> 00:53:11,489
I'M FEEDING HIM AND I DON'T

2064
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:12,990
REALIZE HE HAS A DIRTY DIAPER.

2065
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:13,991
>> YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO

2066
00:53:13,991 --> 00:53:14,892
MAKE HIS BOTTLES.

2067
00:53:14,892 --> 00:53:16,894
THAT'S HOW MUCH YOU DON'T PAY

2068
00:53:16,894 --> 00:53:18,729
ATTENTION TO, LIKE, WHAT HE EATS

2069
00:53:18,729 --> 00:53:19,730
AND STUFF.

2070
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:20,831
'CAUSE YOU TELL ME YOU'LL SHAPE

2071
00:53:20,831 --> 00:53:22,667
UP, AND YOU WON'T.

2072
00:53:22,667 --> 00:53:24,369
YOU'RE JUST GONNA KEEP ON DOING

2073
00:53:24,369 --> 00:53:25,470
WHAT YOU'RE DOING UNTIL I START

2074
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:28,105
RESENTING YOU, 'CAUSE THAT'S

2075
00:53:28,105 --> 00:53:29,740
WHAT'S STARTING TO HAPPEN,

2076
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:30,541
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT

2077
00:53:30,541 --> 00:53:32,009
DOING ANYTHING.

2078
00:53:32,009 --> 00:53:33,244
AND I DON'T EVEN NEED YOU TO DO

2079
00:53:33,244 --> 00:53:34,479
ANYTHING FOR ME.

2080
00:53:34,479 --> 00:53:35,413
I WANT YOU TO DO SOMETHING

2081
00:53:35,413 --> 00:53:36,247
FOR HIM.

2082
00:53:36,247 --> 00:53:37,548
BUT YOU DON'T EVEN WANT TO

2083
00:53:37,548 --> 00:53:38,249
DO THAT.

2084
00:53:38,249 --> 00:53:40,718
LIKE, YOU JUST LIKE HIM THERE.

2085
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:42,853
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

2086
00:53:42,853 --> 00:53:43,754
>> NOTHING.

2087
00:53:43,754 --> 00:53:44,722
>> YOU WANT YOUR LIFE TO BE

2088
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:45,556
REGULAR.

2089
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:46,591
>> NO.

2090
00:53:46,591 --> 00:53:47,658
>> YEAH, YOU DO.

2091
00:53:47,658 --> 00:53:48,393
>> NO, I DON'T.

2092
00:53:48,393 --> 00:53:50,528
DON'T GO TO CONCLUSIONS.

2093
00:53:50,528 --> 00:53:52,530
>> WELL, WHAT DO YOU DO?

2094
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:53,364
>> THERE'S NOTHING--

2095
00:53:53,364 --> 00:53:55,132
LIKE, I DON'T HAVE TIME TO DO

2096
00:53:55,132 --> 00:53:56,200
ANYTHING.

2097
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:57,101
>> YES, YOU DO.

2098
00:53:57,101 --> 00:53:58,102
IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO YOUR

2099
00:53:58,102 --> 00:53:59,537
IMMATURE WAYS, WE COULD GO.

2100
00:53:59,537 --> 00:54:00,538
I TELL YOU THAT ALL THE TIME.

2101
00:54:00,538 --> 00:54:01,472
WE DON'T NEED TO BE HERE.

2102
00:54:01,472 --> 00:54:02,573
YOU COULD GO RIGHT BACK TO YOUR

2103
00:54:02,573 --> 00:54:03,274
NORMAL LIFE.

2104
00:54:03,274 --> 00:54:04,809
PRETEND IT NEVER HAPPENED.

2105
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:05,710
OKAY?

2106
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:06,811
YOU WANT THAT TO HAPPEN?

2107
00:54:06,811 --> 00:54:08,012
'CAUSE THAT'S HOW IT SEEMS YOU

2108
00:54:08,012 --> 00:54:11,382
WANT IT TO HAPPEN.

2109
00:54:11,382 --> 00:54:12,583
YOU THINK WE'RE GONNA WORK IF

2110
00:54:12,583 --> 00:54:14,719
YOU KEEP ACTING LIKE THIS? HMM?

2111
00:54:14,719 --> 00:54:15,520
>> NO.

2112
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:16,521
>> THEN WHY DO YOU KEEP ACTING

2113
00:54:16,521 --> 00:54:19,156
LIKE THAT?

2114
00:54:19,156 --> 00:54:23,894
HMM?

2115
00:54:23,894 --> 00:54:26,030
HELLO?

2116
00:54:27,432 --> 00:54:28,966
>> I'M LOSING HOPE THAT JOEY

2117
00:54:28,966 --> 00:54:30,568
WILL EVER CHANGE.

2118
00:54:30,568 --> 00:54:31,769
THE LESS HE HELPS WITH AYDENN,

2119
00:54:31,769 --> 00:54:33,003
THE MORE I THINK ABOUT

2120
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:34,872
WALKING AWAY.

2121
00:54:47,418 --> 00:54:48,619
>> THINGS WITH JOEY HAVE GONE

2122
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:50,020
FROM BAD TO WORSE SINCE OUR

2123
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,121
LAST TALK.

2124
00:54:51,121 --> 00:54:53,057
HE'S REALLY MAD AT ME, AND HE

2125
00:54:53,057 --> 00:54:55,726
STARTED SLEEPING ON THE COUCH.

2126
00:54:59,930 --> 00:55:00,931
>> HOW ARE THINGS GOING WITH

2127
00:55:00,931 --> 00:55:01,632
JOEY?

2128
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:02,667
>> HE'S LIKE, "I'M JUST ALWAYS

2129
00:55:02,667 --> 00:55:04,068
MISERABLY WITH YOU."

2130
00:55:04,068 --> 00:55:05,603
I WAS LIKE, "WHY AM I EVEN

2131
00:55:05,603 --> 00:55:06,704
HERE?"

2132
00:55:06,704 --> 00:55:07,705
I WAS LIKE, "WHY AM I

2133
00:55:07,705 --> 00:55:08,673
EVEN HERE?"

2134
00:55:08,673 --> 00:55:10,040
>> HE'S LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW."

2135
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,108
I'M LIKE...

2136
00:55:11,108 --> 00:55:13,478
>> WOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE HE TOLD

2137
00:55:13,478 --> 00:55:15,045
YOU HE'S MISERABLE WITH YOU.

2138
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:16,313
>> IT'S JUST NOT WORKING.

2139
00:55:16,313 --> 00:55:17,482
AT FIRST IT STARTED--I THINK THE

2140
00:55:17,482 --> 00:55:18,516
REASON I STOPPED PAYING

2141
00:55:18,516 --> 00:55:19,484
ATTENTION TO HIM, 'CAUSE HE

2142
00:55:19,484 --> 00:55:20,418
WOULDN'T HELP WITH AYDENN.

2143
00:55:20,418 --> 00:55:21,285
LIKE, IT JUST STARTED

2144
00:55:21,285 --> 00:55:22,753
TO FADE AWAY.

2145
00:55:22,753 --> 00:55:23,454
I DON'T KNOW.

2146
00:55:23,454 --> 00:55:24,555
IT'S LIKE, "THIS KID CANNOT

2147
00:55:24,555 --> 00:55:25,222
GROW UP."

2148
00:55:25,222 --> 00:55:26,190
>> YEAH, IT'S LIKE IT'S BEEN

2149
00:55:26,190 --> 00:55:27,191
GOING ON FOR A WHILE, SO--

2150
00:55:27,191 --> 00:55:29,460
>> YEAH, BASICALLY SINCE AFTER

2151
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:30,995
TWO WEEKS OF AYDENN BEING BORN.

2152
00:55:30,995 --> 00:55:31,962
THAT'S WHEN IT STARTED

2153
00:55:31,962 --> 00:55:32,863
GETTING BAD.

2154
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:34,298
>> THAT LONG ALREADY?

2155
00:55:34,298 --> 00:55:35,099
>> YEAH.

2156
00:55:35,099 --> 00:55:36,266
I LIKE, DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW MUCH

2157
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:38,235
MORE I CAN TAKE OF JOEY'S CRAP.

2158
00:55:38,235 --> 00:55:39,937
>> DO YOU WANT TO BREAK UP, OR

2159
00:55:39,937 --> 00:55:43,140
I MEAN, WHAT ARE YOU THINKING

2160
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:43,941
ABOUT IT?

2161
00:55:43,941 --> 00:55:45,309
>> LIKE, I REALLY DIDN'T

2162
00:55:45,309 --> 00:55:46,844
WANT TO.

2163
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:49,213
BUT LIKE, I'M GETTING TIRED OF

2164
00:55:49,213 --> 00:55:51,115
TRYING AND GETTING NO FEEDBACK

2165
00:55:51,115 --> 00:55:52,750
ON MY TRYING.

2166
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:54,218
>> WELL, IF ANYTHING HAPPENS,

2167
00:55:54,218 --> 00:55:55,252
YOU KNOW YOU CAN CALL ME, TEXT

2168
00:55:55,252 --> 00:55:56,387
ME, WHATEVER.

2169
00:55:56,387 --> 00:55:58,255
>> OKAY, I APPRECIATE IT.

2170
00:55:58,255 --> 00:55:58,956
I'M GONNA GO.

2171
00:55:58,956 --> 00:56:00,991
>> NO PROBLEM. OKAY.

2172
00:56:04,895 --> 00:56:06,363
THE NEXT DAY AT SCHOOL, JOEY

2173
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:09,434
STARTED SENDING ME CRAZY TEXTS.

2174
00:56:09,434 --> 00:56:10,334
BUT TODAY'S BEEN, LIKE,

2175
00:56:10,334 --> 00:56:10,968
HORRIBLE.

2176
00:56:10,968 --> 00:56:11,936
LIKE, HE'S BEEN SENDING ME

2177
00:56:11,936 --> 00:56:12,803
THESE ALL DAY.

2178
00:56:12,803 --> 00:56:14,038
>> WHAT IS HE TELLING YOU?

2179
00:56:14,038 --> 00:56:15,906
>> HE'S LIKE, "WHY CAN'T THINGS

2180
00:56:15,906 --> 00:56:18,142
BE LIKE THEY USED TO BE?

2181
00:56:18,142 --> 00:56:19,143
YOU NEVER HAVE TIME FOR

2182
00:56:19,143 --> 00:56:20,310
ME ANYMORE.

2183
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:21,879
ALL YOU DO IS GET MAD AT ME

2184
00:56:21,879 --> 00:56:22,847
ABOUT THE BABY.

2185
00:56:22,847 --> 00:56:24,081
YOU'RE NEVER HAPPY.

2186
00:56:24,081 --> 00:56:25,282
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST BE HAPPY

2187
00:56:25,282 --> 00:56:26,484
BEING WITH ME?"

2188
00:56:26,484 --> 00:56:27,785
>> SO HE'S JEALOUS OF THE BABY?

2189
00:56:27,785 --> 00:56:28,819
>> THAT'S KIND OF WHAT IT SOUNDS

2190
00:56:28,819 --> 00:56:29,520
LIKE, RIGHT?

2191
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,488
AND THEN HE SAYS I MAKE HIM

2192
00:56:30,488 --> 00:56:31,656
MISERABLE ALL THE TIME.

2193
00:56:31,656 --> 00:56:32,857
I GUESS HE THOUGHT EVERYTHING

2194
00:56:32,857 --> 00:56:34,191
WILL BE THE SAME, AND IT'S LIKE

2195
00:56:34,191 --> 00:56:35,292
TOTALLY DIFFERENT THAN HE

2196
00:56:35,292 --> 00:56:36,326
THOUGHT, BECAUSE IT IS TOTALLY

2197
00:56:36,326 --> 00:56:37,695
DIFFERENT THAN I THOUGHT TOO.

2198
00:56:37,695 --> 00:56:38,996
AND I THINK I'M JUST DONE TRYING

2199
00:56:38,996 --> 00:56:41,031
TO MAKE IT WORK.

2200
00:56:41,031 --> 00:56:42,800
>> SO HAVE YOU TEXTED HIM BACK?

2201
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:43,701
>> I'M ABOUT TO TEXT HIM

2202
00:56:43,701 --> 00:56:44,902
RIGHT NOW AND TELL HIM, LIKE,

2203
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:46,871
I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.

2204
00:56:46,871 --> 00:56:47,972
AND I DON'T THINK IT'S GOOD FOR

2205
00:56:47,972 --> 00:56:48,573
AYDENN.

2206
00:56:48,573 --> 00:56:49,607
I JUST HOPE IT'S THE RIGHT THING

2207
00:56:49,607 --> 00:56:50,374
TO DO.

2208
00:56:50,374 --> 00:56:51,308
BUT I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT

2209
00:56:51,308 --> 00:56:51,909
AYDENN.

2210
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:53,377
I JUST WANT AYDENN TO BE OKAY.

2211
00:56:53,377 --> 00:56:54,479
>> YOU THINK YOU'LL REGRET THIS

2212
00:56:54,479 --> 00:56:56,046
AT ALL?

2213
00:56:56,046 --> 00:56:58,115
>> I HOPE NOT, BUT I CAN'T TAKE

2214
00:56:58,115 --> 00:56:59,750
THIS ANYMORE.

2215
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:01,418
IT'S DONE.

2216
00:57:01,418 --> 00:57:02,319
IT'S BEST FOR EVERYBODY,

2217
00:57:02,319 --> 00:57:05,422
I THINK.

2218
00:57:05,422 --> 00:57:06,924
BEFORE PICKING UP THE BABY FROM

2219
00:57:06,924 --> 00:57:09,326
DAY CARE, I WENT HOME TO TALK TO

2220
00:57:09,326 --> 00:57:10,961
JOEY FACE-TO-FACE.

2221
00:57:10,961 --> 00:57:12,329
>> NOW YOU WANT TO LEAVE NOW?

2222
00:57:12,329 --> 00:57:13,197
WHAT ARE YOU?

2223
00:57:13,197 --> 00:57:14,465
YOU'RE FRIGGING UNGRATEFUL.

2224
00:57:14,465 --> 00:57:16,166
YOU HAD IT GOOD HERE.

2225
00:57:16,166 --> 00:57:17,401
YOU HAD AT LEAST SOMEBODY WHO

2226
00:57:17,401 --> 00:57:18,368
CARED FOR YOU.

2227
00:57:18,368 --> 00:57:20,571
>> PLEASE STOP, OKAY?

2228
00:57:20,571 --> 00:57:23,040
YOU KNEW WE WERE DOING BAD.

2229
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:24,008
YOU EVEN TOLD ME.

2230
00:57:24,008 --> 00:57:25,209
YOU SENT ME LITTLE NASTY TEXT

2231
00:57:25,209 --> 00:57:26,276
MESSAGES ABOUT HOW WE'RE GONNA

2232
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:27,578
DO BAD.

2233
00:57:27,578 --> 00:57:28,579
"WATCH, WE'RE GONNA BREAK UP.

2234
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:29,580
SOMETHING BAD IS GONNA HAPPEN

2235
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:30,981
TO YOU," ALL THIS BULL[bleep].

2236
00:57:30,981 --> 00:57:32,617
YOU TELL ME I'M SO UNGRATEFUL?

2237
00:57:32,617 --> 00:57:33,417
>> YES, YOU ARE.

2238
00:57:33,417 --> 00:57:34,418
>> NO, I'M NOT.

2239
00:57:34,418 --> 00:57:35,586
>> YES, YOU ARE.

2240
00:57:35,586 --> 00:57:37,588
>> HOW AM I UNGRATEFUL?

2241
00:57:37,588 --> 00:57:38,656
>> I TRIED TO PROVIDE YOU WITH

2242
00:57:38,656 --> 00:57:39,356
EVERYTHING.

2243
00:57:39,356 --> 00:57:40,290
I TRIED TO PUT A ROOF OVER

2244
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:40,958
YOUR HEAD.

2245
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:42,493
I STOOD BY YOU.

2246
00:57:42,493 --> 00:57:43,427
>> YOU THINK I NEVER STOOD

2247
00:57:43,427 --> 00:57:44,529
BY YOU?

2248
00:57:44,529 --> 00:57:45,663
>> I STOOD BY YOU EVEN WHEN YOU

2249
00:57:45,663 --> 00:57:46,430
WERE PREGNANT.

2250
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:48,232
>> JOEY, WHEN I WAS PREGNANT I

2251
00:57:48,232 --> 00:57:49,299
WAS GONNA GO TO JERSEY.

2252
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:50,467
I KEPT TELLING MY MOM, "NO, NO,

2253
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,236
I WANT TO STAY WITH HIM."

2254
00:57:52,236 --> 00:57:53,237
YOU NOTICE I GOT PISSED AT YOU

2255
00:57:53,237 --> 00:57:54,338
WHEN YOU STOPPED TAKING CARE OF

2256
00:57:54,338 --> 00:57:55,005
AYDENN.

2257
00:57:55,005 --> 00:57:57,441
>> TAKING CARE--I WAS TRYING.

2258
00:57:57,441 --> 00:57:58,408
JUST BECAUSE IN THE MIDDLE OF

2259
00:57:58,408 --> 00:58:00,344
THE NIGHT--DOESN'T MEAN [bleep].

2260
00:58:00,344 --> 00:58:01,311
I TRIED.

2261
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:02,613
I TRIED FEEDING HIM.

2262
00:58:02,613 --> 00:58:04,081
>> GOOD JOB TRYING TO FEED HIM.

2263
00:58:04,081 --> 00:58:05,683
>> I TRIED CHANGING HIS DIAPER.

2264
00:58:05,683 --> 00:58:06,784
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU TRIED?

2265
00:58:06,784 --> 00:58:07,885
>> I EVEN TRIED TO VOLUNTEER TO

2266
00:58:07,885 --> 00:58:09,854
GIVE HIM A BATH.

2267
00:58:09,854 --> 00:58:10,888
>> GOOD, VOLUNTEER EVERY ONCE

2268
00:58:10,888 --> 00:58:12,590
A WEEK.

2269
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:13,490
>> I TRIED EVERY DAY.

2270
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,458
>> 'CAUSE HE DOESN'T NEED TO

2271
00:58:14,458 --> 00:58:15,425
TAKE A BATH EVERY DAY OR EAT

2272
00:58:15,425 --> 00:58:16,226
EVERY THREE HOURS.

2273
00:58:16,226 --> 00:58:18,128
>> I TRIED EVERY DAY.

2274
00:58:18,128 --> 00:58:18,996
WHEN DID WE BECOME SO

2275
00:58:18,996 --> 00:58:20,230
BROKEN, HUH?

2276
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:21,699
>> WHEN YOU STOPPED TAKING CARE

2277
00:58:21,699 --> 00:58:22,600
OF AYDENN.

2278
00:58:22,600 --> 00:58:23,400
>> 'CAUSE OF THAT?

2279
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,202
>> YEAH.

2280
00:58:25,202 --> 00:58:28,005

[phone trilling]

2300
00:59:49,987 --> 00:59:50,788
>> HELLO?

2301
00:59:50,788 --> 00:59:52,990
>> HEY, ME AND JOEY JUST

2302
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:55,192
BROKE UP.

2303
00:59:55,192 --> 00:59:56,026
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?

2304
00:59:56,026 --> 00:59:56,694
>> YEAH.

2305
00:59:56,694 --> 00:59:57,895
>> ARE YOU OKAY?

2306
00:59:57,895 --> 01:00:00,564
>> UM, I DON'T KNOW.

2307
01:00:00,564 --> 01:00:01,598
DO YOU THINK IT'S COOL IF I COME

2308
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:03,533
STAY WITH YOU?

2309
01:00:03,533 --> 01:00:04,334
>> YEAH.

2310
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:05,235
UM, YOU WANT ME TO GO

2311
01:00:05,235 --> 01:00:06,170
PICK YOU UP?

2312
01:00:06,170 --> 01:00:09,473
>> YEAH, I'M OUTSIDE HIS HOUSE.

2313
01:00:09,473 --> 01:00:10,741
>> OKAY, I'M ON MY WAY.

2314
01:00:10,741 --> 01:00:12,242
>> OKAY.

2315
01:00:12,242 --> 01:00:12,943
>> BYE.

2316
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:13,610
>> BYE.

2317
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:14,812
I DON'T THINK JOEY WAS READY FOR

2318
01:00:14,812 --> 01:00:15,479
A BABY.

2319
01:00:15,479 --> 01:00:16,613
I THINK ONCE HE WAS BORN IT KIND

2320
01:00:16,613 --> 01:00:18,916
OF HIT HIM LIKE, "WHOA, THIS IS

2321
01:00:18,916 --> 01:00:20,517
A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITY."

2322
01:00:20,517 --> 01:00:21,585
AND HE DIDN'T TAKE UP TO HIS

2323
01:00:21,585 --> 01:00:22,519
RESPONSIBILITIES.

2324
01:00:22,519 --> 01:00:23,520
SO I DON'T THINK HE WAS READY

2325
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,355
AT ALL.

2326
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:26,023
>> HEY.

2327
01:00:26,023 --> 01:00:27,257
>> HEY.

2328
01:00:27,257 --> 01:00:29,093
I THINK JOEY THOUGHT OUR

2329
01:00:29,093 --> 01:00:30,527
RELATIONSHIP WOULD BE THE SAME,

2330
01:00:30,527 --> 01:00:32,029
LIKE HOW IT WAS BEFORE I WAS

2331
01:00:32,029 --> 01:00:33,197
PREGNANT, WHILE I WAS PREGNANT,

2332
01:00:33,197 --> 01:00:36,200
AND WHEN AYDENN WAS BORN.

2333
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,234
>> YEAH, RIGHT NOW?

2334
01:00:37,234 --> 01:00:38,035
>> YEAH.

2335
01:00:38,035 --> 01:00:39,670
PARENTING IS VERY HARD.

2336
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:41,271
BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA

2337
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:42,239
BE EASY.

2338
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:43,240
I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE ME,

2339
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,174
JOEY, AND THE BABY.

2340
01:00:44,174 --> 01:00:46,410
SO WE'D TAKE TURNS.

2341
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:48,545
I NEVER GET SLEEP.

2342
01:00:48,545 --> 01:00:50,848
IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE, AND I'M BY

2343
01:00:50,848 --> 01:00:51,949
MYSELF NOW.

2344
01:00:51,949 --> 01:00:53,617
IT'S NOT ANYTHING I THOUGHT IT

2345
01:00:53,617 --> 01:00:54,484
WOULD BE.

2346
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:55,652
>> YOU GOT IT?

2347
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:56,486
YOU GOT EVERYTHING?

2348
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,989
I'M GONNA GET YOUR BAG.

2349
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:00,257
>> I'M SO CLOSE TO FINISHING

2350
01:01:00,257 --> 01:01:01,759
HIGH SCHOOL.

2351
01:01:01,759 --> 01:01:03,593
AND I THINK I COULD DEAL WITH

2352
01:01:03,593 --> 01:01:04,661
STAYING IN TEXAS FOR A COUPLE

2353
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:06,463
MORE MONTHS, BECAUSE IF I GO

2354
01:01:06,463 --> 01:01:09,233
TO NEW JERSEY, I'LL HAVE TO STAY

2355
01:01:09,233 --> 01:01:11,635
BACK AND BE A SENIOR AGAIN;

2356
01:01:11,635 --> 01:01:13,470
RATHER THAN STAYING HERE, I'LL

2357
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:14,705
GRADUATE THIS YEAR.

2358
01:01:14,705 --> 01:01:15,906
>> WHERE ARE YOU?

2359
01:01:15,906 --> 01:01:17,674
>> I'M AT ASHLEY'S HOUSE.

2360
01:01:17,674 --> 01:01:19,009
>> WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS?

2361
01:01:19,009 --> 01:01:20,210
>> I'M JUST TRYING TO STAY HERE

2362
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:20,911
TO GRADUATE.

2363
01:01:20,911 --> 01:01:22,713
>> I WOULD PREFER YOU HERE.

2364
01:01:22,713 --> 01:01:23,881
>> I WOULD PREFER TO BE THERE

2365
01:01:23,881 --> 01:01:24,949
TOO, BUT I'M NOT GONNA FAIL

2366
01:01:24,949 --> 01:01:26,150
HIGH SCHOOL.

2367
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:27,184
>> BETTER NOT.

2368
01:01:27,184 --> 01:01:28,753
>> I AM VERY EXCITED TO GO HOME

2369
01:01:28,753 --> 01:01:29,586
AND BE WITH MY MOM.

2370
01:01:29,586 --> 01:01:31,521
I CAN'T WAIT TILL GRADUATION.

2371
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:33,357
I WILL LEAVE THAT DAY TO GO WITH

2372
01:01:33,357 --> 01:01:35,559
MY MOM AND TO JERSEY.

2373
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:36,761
JOEY CAN STILL SEE AYDENN

2374
01:01:36,761 --> 01:01:37,795
WHENEVER HE WANTS.

2375
01:01:37,795 --> 01:01:38,462
BUT IT'S UP

2376
01:01:38,462 --> 01:01:39,629
TO HIM IF HE WANTS TO SEE AYDENN

2377
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:41,131
OR NOT, NOT ME.

2378
01:01:41,131 --> 01:01:42,767
I USED TO THINK THAT THE MOST

2379
01:01:42,767 --> 01:01:44,234
IMPORTANT THING FOR AYDENN WAS

2380
01:01:44,234 --> 01:01:45,870
TO MAKE SURE HE HAD TWO PARENTS.

2381
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:47,972
THAT'S WHY I STAYED HERE.

2382
01:01:47,972 --> 01:01:50,174
AND WHAT I ALWAYS TOLD JOEY.

2383
01:01:50,174 --> 01:01:52,442
BUT I THINK THAT'S CHANGED,

2384
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:53,811
BECAUSE I THINK THE MOST

2385
01:01:53,811 --> 01:01:54,611
IMPORTANT THING...

2386
01:01:54,611 --> 01:01:55,312
HI, SWEETIE.

2387
01:01:55,312 --> 01:01:56,847
ABOUT HAVING A CHILD IS MAKING

2388
01:01:56,847 --> 01:01:58,115
SURE THAT THEY'RE STABLE,

2389
01:01:58,115 --> 01:02:00,717
HAPPY, AND OKAY,

2390
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:02,286
EVEN IF THAT MEANS HAVING ONE

2391
01:02:02,286 --> 01:02:04,388
PARENT AROUND.

2392
01:02:18,635 --> 01:02:21,105
>> announcer: NEXT WEEK, ON THE:

2393
01:02:21,105 --> 01:02:22,206

TEENAGE MOMS HERE.

2395

01:02:24,975 --> 01:02:26,076

01:02:27,878 --> 01:02:29,880
WHY AM I CRYING SO MUCH?

2399
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:30,881

01:02:30,881 --> 01:02:32,249
YOUR NECK?

2408
01:02:40,624 --> 01:02:42,459
FALLING APART.

2409
01:02:42,459 --> 01:02:43,493

01:02:43,493 --> 01:02:44,428
