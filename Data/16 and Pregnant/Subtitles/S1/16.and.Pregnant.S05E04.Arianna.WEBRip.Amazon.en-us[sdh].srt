00:00:03,933 --> 00:00:05,067
>> [laughing]

2
00:00:05,067 --> 00:00:05,867
I'M ARIANNA.

3
00:00:05,867 --> 00:00:07,467
I'M A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL,

4
00:00:07,467 --> 00:00:09,733
AND I LIVE IN SMYRNA, GEORGIA.

5
00:00:09,733 --> 00:00:10,700
MOST PEOPLE THINK OF ME AS A

6
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:13,233
CREATIVE ARTSY TYPE, WHICH I AM.

7
00:00:13,233 --> 00:00:14,567
>> I SEEN A KID OUTSIDE.

8
00:00:14,567 --> 00:00:15,833
HE HAD THE SAME COLOR HAIR.

9
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:16,467
>> HE HAD BLUE HAIR?

10
00:00:16,467 --> 00:00:17,733
>> THE WHOLE--YEAH.

11
00:00:17,733 --> 00:00:18,767
>> BUT I WANT TO GO TO COLLEGE

12
00:00:18,767 --> 00:00:20,167
TO STUDY PSYCHOLOGY BECAUSE

13
00:00:20,167 --> 00:00:21,100
THERE'S BEEN LOTS TO ANALYZE IN

14
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:22,167
MY LIFE.

15
00:00:22,167 --> 00:00:23,933
MY MOM HAD ME WHEN SHE WAS 17,

16
00:00:23,933 --> 00:00:25,100
AND MY DAD LEFT WHEN I WAS A

17
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,033
BABY.

18
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:27,333
IT WAS REALLY HARD GROWING UP

19
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:28,000
WITHOUT A DAD.

20
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,733
>> JUST OUT OF THE BLUE ONE DAY,

21
00:00:29,733 --> 00:00:30,567
YOU WAS LIKE, "WHY DON'T MY

22
00:00:30,567 --> 00:00:31,800
DADDY LOVE ME?"

23
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,900
THAT JUST MADE ME HATE HIM THAT

24
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,200
MUCH MORE.

25
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:34,900
>> MY MOM GOT REMARRIED

26
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,233
RECENTLY, AND I REALLY DISLIKE

27
00:00:36,233 --> 00:00:38,100
MY STEPFAMILY, SO NOW I LIVE

28
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,567
WITH MY GRANDMA IN AN APARTMENT

29
00:00:39,567 --> 00:00:40,667
SO SMALL, WE HAVE TO SHARE A

30
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:41,467
BED.

31
00:00:41,467 --> 00:00:42,700
NIGHT, GRANDMA, I LOVE YOU.

32
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,367
>> LOVE YOU.

33
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:44,500
>> I DON'T MIND BECAUSE I'M

34
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,500
USUALLY HANGING OUT WITH

35
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:46,367
MAURICE.

36
00:00:46,367 --> 00:00:47,200
WE'VE BEEN FRIENDS SINCE MY

37
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,300
FRESHMAN YEAR, THEN WHEN HE TOLD

38
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:50,967
ME HE HAD FEELINGS FOR ME, WE

39
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,467
STARTED DATING AND THINGS GOT

40
00:00:52,467 --> 00:00:53,467
SERIOUS...

41
00:00:53,467 --> 00:00:54,233
>> I LOVE YOU.

42
00:00:54,233 --> 00:00:54,933
>> LOVE YOU TOO.

43
00:00:54,933 --> 00:00:57,000
A LITTLE TOO SERIOUS BECAUSE NOW

44
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
I'M PREGNANT.

45
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:07,100
MAURICE AND I WERE ONLY DATING A

46
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,067
MONTH AND A HALF WHEN I GOT

47
00:01:08,067 --> 00:01:09,100
PREGNANT, AND IT CHANGED

48
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,867
EVERYTHING BETWEEN US.

49
00:01:10,867 --> 00:01:12,333
WE STARTED ARGUING ALL THE TIME

50
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:13,567
BECAUSE IT BECAME CLEAR THAT HE

51
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:15,067
TALKED A BIG GAME, BUT THEN HE'D

52
00:01:15,067 --> 00:01:16,600
FLAKE ON HELPING AND WOULDN'T

53
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:18,400
CHIP IN ANY MONEY.

54
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,667
MY MOM AND GRANDMA HAVE ALREADY

55
00:01:19,667 --> 00:01:21,067
SPENT MORE THAN THEY CAN AFFORD,

56
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:22,067
AND I FEEL REALLY GUILTY ABOUT

57
00:01:22,067 --> 00:01:22,733
THAT.

58
00:01:22,733 --> 00:01:24,167
IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE A BURDEN

59
00:01:24,167 --> 00:01:25,367
BECAUSE I CAN'T HELP YOU GUYS

60
00:01:25,367 --> 00:01:27,233
RIGHT NOW, AND ALL I WANT TO DO

61
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:29,467
IS PAY YOU GUYS BACK.

62
00:01:29,467 --> 00:01:30,867
AND THEN SIX MONTHS INTO MY

63
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:32,367
PREGNANCY, HE HAD THE NERVE TO

64
00:01:32,367 --> 00:01:34,267
DEMAND A PATERNITY TEST.

65
00:01:34,267 --> 00:01:35,633
[sighs]

66
00:01:35,633 --> 00:01:36,833
NOW WE'RE BROKEN UP, AND WE'RE

67
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:39,100
HARDLY SPEAKING TO EACH OTHER,

68
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:40,567
SO I'M TRYING TO FOCUS ON SCHOOL

69
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:41,533
AND SPEND TIME WITH MY REAL

70
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:42,200
FRIENDS.

71
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,667
EW, IT LOOKS GROSS.

72
00:01:45,667 --> 00:01:46,633
NO, THAT'S GOOD. THAT'S GOOD.

73
00:01:46,633 --> 00:01:47,433
>> WHAT'S IT TASTE LIKE?

74
00:01:47,433 --> 00:01:49,433
>> I'M GETTING THAT ONE.

75
00:01:51,133 --> 00:01:53,333
>> HOMECOMING'S COMING UP, AND

76
00:01:53,333 --> 00:01:54,067
IT'S SENIOR YEAR.

77
00:01:54,067 --> 00:01:55,067
>> UH-OH.

78
00:01:55,067 --> 00:01:56,867
>> DO YOU WANT TO BE MY DATE?

79
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:57,933
>> UH.

80
00:01:57,933 --> 00:01:59,667
NO, I DON'T KNOW.

81
00:01:59,667 --> 00:02:01,400
>> ARI, WHY?

82
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,800
>> I DON'T--BECAUSE, LIKE,

83
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,267
I'LL BE, LIKE, PREGNANT FOR

84
00:02:05,267 --> 00:02:06,267
HOMECOMING.

85
00:02:06,267 --> 00:02:07,867
>> AT LEAST CAN YOU THINK ABOUT

86
00:02:07,867 --> 00:02:08,833
IT FOR ME?

87
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:10,133
>> I MEAN, I'LL THINK ABOUT IT.

88
00:02:10,133 --> 00:02:11,633
>> WHAT DO YOU, LIKE, PLAN ON

89
00:02:11,633 --> 00:02:12,867
DOING AFTER HIGH SCHOOL?

90
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:13,967
>> WELL, I'LL BE DONE WITH ALL

91
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,400
MY CLASSES IN DECEMBER.

92
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,867
IN THE FALL, I'M GOING TO

93
00:02:16,867 --> 00:02:18,900
KENNESAW STATE UNIVERSITY.

94
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:20,867
>> HOW DID YOU FEEL WHEN ARI

95
00:02:20,867 --> 00:02:22,200
FIRST TOLD YOU, LIKE, SHE WAS

96
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,633
PREGNANT?

97
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:25,267
>> I WAS SURPRISED.

98
00:02:25,267 --> 00:02:25,933
>> I CRIED.

99
00:02:25,933 --> 00:02:26,667
>> DID YOU CRY, LIKE, SAD?

100
00:02:26,667 --> 00:02:28,467
>> CRIED? WHY WOULD YOU CRY?

101
00:02:28,467 --> 00:02:30,267
>> BECAUSE MY LIFE WAS ABOUT TO

102
00:02:30,267 --> 00:02:31,633
CHANGE, AND I HAD NO CONTROL

103
00:02:31,633 --> 00:02:32,867
OVER IT ANYMORE.

104
00:02:32,867 --> 00:02:33,767
>> HOW'D YOU TELL MAURICE THAT

105
00:02:33,767 --> 00:02:34,767
YOU WERE PREGNANT?

106
00:02:34,767 --> 00:02:35,933
>> I HAD HIM COME OVER 'CAUSE HE

107
00:02:35,933 --> 00:02:37,233
LIVED RIGHT UP THE STREET AT THE

108
00:02:37,233 --> 00:02:39,067
TIME, SO I HAD HIM COME OVER,

109
00:02:39,067 --> 00:02:40,633
AND I JUST, LIKE, SHOWED HIM

110
00:02:40,633 --> 00:02:42,433
THE PREGNANCY TEST.

111
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:43,500
HE WAS, LIKE, SHOCKED, BUT THEN

112
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:45,100
HE WAS, LIKE, HAPPY--LIKE A

113
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:47,567
HOUSE AND CAR AND MONEY AND BABY

114
00:02:47,567 --> 00:02:48,433
STUFF WAS JUST GONNA FALL OUT

115
00:02:48,433 --> 00:02:49,533
THE SKY.

116
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:50,467
>> YEAH, I DON'T THINK IT REALLY

117
00:02:50,467 --> 00:02:51,567
HIT HIM AT THAT POINT, MAN.

118
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:52,600
LIKE, IT MIGHT HAVE, LIKE--

119
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,900
>> IT STILL HASN'T HIT HIM.

120
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,367
THE BABY SHOWED ME, WHEN I

121
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:56,533
GOT PREGNANT, HIS TRUE COLORS--

122
00:02:56,533 --> 00:02:57,833
LIKE, HE'S NOT AMBITIOUS, NOT

123
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,233
MOTIVATED, HE'S RUDE, HE'S

124
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:02,433
DISRESPECTFUL, AND HE'S LAZY AND

125
00:03:02,433 --> 00:03:03,100
IRRESPONSIBLE.

126
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,167
>> NICE.

127
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:06,167
DO YOU THINK YOU AND MAURICE

128
00:03:06,167 --> 00:03:08,067
WILL HAVE, LIKE, A FUTURE?

129
00:03:08,067 --> 00:03:10,100
>> IF HE CHANGES, POSSIBLY.

130
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,933
IF HE DOESN'T, DEFINITELY NOT.

131
00:03:11,933 --> 00:03:13,333
I WANT HIM TO CHANGE FOR AIDEN

132
00:03:13,333 --> 00:03:14,633
FIRST BEFORE HE CHANGES FOR ME.

133
00:03:14,633 --> 00:03:15,633
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S GONNA HIT

134
00:03:15,633 --> 00:03:17,367
HIM UNTIL HE ACTUALLY GETS HERE,

135
00:03:17,367 --> 00:03:18,733
AND HE'S GONNA BE LIKE, "WOW."

136
00:03:18,733 --> 00:03:19,700
>> I DON'T EVEN THINK IT'LL HIT

137
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,300
HIM THEN HONESTLY.

138
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,567
TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST WITH YOU

139
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:24,067
GUYS, I DON'T BELIEVE THAT HE'S

140
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:24,733
GOING TO COME AROUND.

141
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:27,067
I MEAN...

142
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:28,333
MIRACLES CAN HAPPEN, BUT NO,

143
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,333
I CAN'T SEE IT.

144
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:31,767
UH-UH.

145
00:03:33,533 --> 00:03:35,133
NOT HAVING MY OWN DAD AROUND

146
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:36,467
MEANT THAT MY MOM AND I HAVE

147
00:03:36,467 --> 00:03:37,633
ALWAYS BEEN VERY CLOSE.

148
00:03:37,633 --> 00:03:39,867
STILL, I NEVER THOUGHT I'D MAKE

149
00:03:39,867 --> 00:03:41,067
THE SAME MISTAKE SHE DID.

150
00:03:41,067 --> 00:03:42,700
YOU GAVE ME ALL YOUR BAD GENES--

151
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,067
THE SKIN...

152
00:03:44,067 --> 00:03:46,400
>> SORRY THAT I DID ALL THAT.

153
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,267
SINCE YOU'VE BEEN GOING TO THE

154
00:03:47,267 --> 00:03:49,700
DERMATOLOGIST, HOW DO YOU FEEL

155
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:51,200
ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO TAKE ANY

156
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:52,400
PRODUCTS NOW?

157
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,467
>> I DON'T LIKE IT.

158
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:54,700
>> IT IS GONNA GET BETTER

159
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,867
SOON AS YOU HAVE LITTLE AIDEN.

160
00:03:56,867 --> 00:03:57,733
>> SO HOW'D YOU FEEL WHEN YOU

161
00:03:57,733 --> 00:04:00,533
FIRST FOUND OUT I WAS PREGNANT?

162
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:02,900
>> NOT REALLY DEVASTATED BUT

163
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,700
KIND OF BECAUSE OF EVERYTHING

164
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,333
THAT I HAD TOLD YOU AND TAUGHT

165
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,200
YOU.

166
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,133
YOU KNOW, I THOUGHT ABOUT THE

167
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:10,100
STRUGGLES THAT I WENT THROUGH

168
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,800
BEING A YOUNG MOM.

169
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,167
YOU KNOW HOW THEY SAY PEOPLE

170
00:04:13,167 --> 00:04:14,433
WORK PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK?

171
00:04:14,433 --> 00:04:16,467
THAT'S JUST HOW IT WAS.

172
00:04:16,467 --> 00:04:17,267
WHEN YOU FOUND OUT YOU WERE

173
00:04:17,267 --> 00:04:18,833
PREGNANT WITH AIDEN, DID ANY

174
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,767
OTHER THOUGHTS OR IDEAS COME

175
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:23,500
INTO YOUR MIND AS FAR AS IF YOU

176
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,667
WOULD KEEP HIM OR GIVE HIM UP

177
00:04:24,667 --> 00:04:26,500
OR...

178
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,900
>> ABORTION, NO, BUT AS TIME

179
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,067
WENT ON AND I SEEN HOW HARD IT

180
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:31,700
WAS, I SEE HOW SOME OF MY

181
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,500
FRIENDS' PARENTS LIVE, LIKE, HOW

182
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,767
THEY HAVE REALLY BIG HOUSES,

183
00:04:34,767 --> 00:04:35,733
AND I'M LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW IF

184
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:36,567
I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO DO THAT

185
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,067
FOR HIM."

186
00:04:37,067 --> 00:04:38,400
HE DESERVES A LIFE LIKE THAT, SO

187
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:39,933
MAYBE I SHOULD I GIVE HIM TO A

188
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:41,067
FAMILY THAT CAN GIVE THAT TO

189
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:41,867
HIM, BUT THEN I WAS LIKE,

190
00:04:41,867 --> 00:04:44,367
"I CAN'T DO THAT," SO...

191
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:46,567
IT MAKES ME ANGRY SOMETIMES

192
00:04:46,567 --> 00:04:47,767
BECAUSE I LOOK AROUND AND I SEE

193
00:04:47,767 --> 00:04:48,600
EVERYTHING THAT YOU GUYS HAVE

194
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,933
BOUGHT, AND IT MAKES ME MAD

195
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:51,567
BECAUSE ALL OF IT WAS NOT

196
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:53,767
CONTRIBUTED BY RICE

197
00:04:53,767 --> 00:04:54,833
WHO STILL DON'T HAVE A JOB, AND

198
00:04:54,833 --> 00:04:57,400
IT'S ALMOST THE TIME FOR ME TO

199
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,167
DELIVER.

200
00:04:58,167 --> 00:04:59,567
AND IT'S NOT LIKE I DON'T--

201
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:01,467
I HATE HIM OR SOMETHING NOW,

202
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,100
I STILL HAVE CERTAIN FEELING FOR

203
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,600
RICE.

204
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,167
>> WHEN YOU WERE LITTLE, I COULD

205
00:05:07,167 --> 00:05:09,267
NOT STAND YOUR FATHER.

206
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,933
>> I GET WHERE THAT COMES FROM.

207
00:05:10,933 --> 00:05:11,933
>> AND SO THAT'S WHY AS FAR AS

208
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:13,867
WITH THE SITUATION WITH RICE,

209
00:05:13,867 --> 00:05:15,433
IT COULD COME OUT POSITIVE, AND

210
00:05:15,433 --> 00:05:16,900
THEN IT COULD BE THE SITUATION

211
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,500
I HAD WITH YOU.

212
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,733
>> SINCE I DIDN'T HAVE A FATHER

213
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:21,067
GROWING UP, I'M EXTREMELY

214
00:05:21,067 --> 00:05:22,400
SENSITIVE TO MAURICE NOT BEING

215
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,100
AROUND OR ACTING THE WAY I THINK

216
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:25,200
A GOOD DAD SHOULD.

217
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,300
>> HEY, GRANDMA.

218
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:26,967
>> HOW YOU DOING?

219
00:05:26,967 --> 00:05:28,533
>> WHAT'S GOING ON, GRANDDAD?

220
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:29,533
>> I DON'T KNOW.

221
00:05:29,533 --> 00:05:30,300
NOTHING.

222
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:32,167
>> NOT MUCH? JUST CHILLING.

223
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:33,067
>> SO YOU GETTING READY FOR THE

224
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:33,900
BABY?

225
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,100
>> YEAH, I'M READY, AIN'T GOT NO

226
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:35,933
OTHER CHOICE.

227
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:38,367
>> IT'S REALLY CRUNCH TIME, AND

228
00:05:38,367 --> 00:05:39,833
YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE A LOT OF

229
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:40,867
MONEY COMIN' IN.

230
00:05:40,867 --> 00:05:41,833
NOW THAT THE TIME IS ALMOST

231
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,600
NEAR, YOU JUST REALLY GONNA HAVE

232
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
TO STEP UP, MAURICE.

233
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,133
SO I STILL GOT THIS MUSIC THING.

234
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:51,500
>> [sighs]

235
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:53,267
I KNOW, RICEY, BUT STILL YOU

236
00:05:53,267 --> 00:05:55,067
REALLY NEED TO GET ON THE GRIND

237
00:05:55,067 --> 00:05:56,367
'CAUSE THIS BABY IS ON THE WAY,

238
00:05:56,367 --> 00:05:57,467
AND WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU AND

239
00:05:57,467 --> 00:05:58,567
ARIANNA?

240
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:01,133
>> NAH, WE NOT TOGETHER.

241
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:03,067
SHE GOT UPSET AT ME BECAUSE

242
00:06:03,067 --> 00:06:04,933
I MENTIONED PATERNITY TEST.

243
00:06:04,933 --> 00:06:07,100
>> RIGHT, I MEAN, GRANDDADDY WAS

244
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,933
THE MAIN ONE THAT STARTED IT AND

245
00:06:08,933 --> 00:06:10,933
SAID--AND NOT THAT YOU DIDN'T

246
00:06:10,933 --> 00:06:12,200
TRUST HER--

247
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,933
>> RIGHT, Y'ALL KNOW--I KNOW

248
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:14,600
IT'S MY KID.

249
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:17,233
>> BUT YOU WANTED TO BE SURE

250
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:18,900
THAT MAURICE WAS PROTECTED,

251
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:19,933
YOU KNOW?

252
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:21,267
>> WELL, YEAH, THAT'S THE MAIN

253
00:06:21,267 --> 00:06:21,967
THING.

254
00:06:21,967 --> 00:06:23,533
>> I REALLY WANT TO MAKE THIS

255
00:06:23,533 --> 00:06:25,233
WORK WITH ARIANNA JUST BECAUSE I

256
00:06:25,233 --> 00:06:26,367
KNOW IT'LL BE THE BEST THING FOR

257
00:06:26,367 --> 00:06:27,867
MY SON JUST TO HAVE BOTH OF HIS

258
00:06:27,867 --> 00:06:29,067
PARENTS.

259
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:29,667
>> YEAH.

260
00:06:29,667 --> 00:06:30,600
>> YOU KNOW MY DAD LEFT ME WHEN

261
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,400
I WAS LITTLE.

262
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,433
I DON'T WANT MY SON TO HAVE TO

263
00:06:32,433 --> 00:06:33,933
GO THROUGH THAT OR HAVE TO LEARN

264
00:06:33,933 --> 00:06:35,367
EVERYTHING THAT I LEARNED THE

265
00:06:35,367 --> 00:06:36,833
WAY I DID, YOU KNOW, WITHOUT

266
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,833
HIM.

267
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,333
>> BECAUSE I'M DUE IN DECEMBER,

268
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,767
I'M TAKING ACCELERATED CLASSES

269
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:46,333
ONLINE SO I CAN FINISH ALL MY

270
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,333
COURSE WORK BEFORE AIDEN IS

271
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:48,767
BORN.

272
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:49,700
THIS IS DEFINITELY NOT THE

273
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,600
SENIOR YEAR I HAD ALWAYS

274
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,233
IMAGINED.

275
00:06:52,233 --> 00:06:53,067
I STILL MISS BEING IN A

276
00:06:53,067 --> 00:06:54,333
CLASSROOM.

277
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,833
>> THE STUFF THAT SENIORS DO?

278
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:57,933
>> OH, YEAH, LIKE SENIOR

279
00:06:57,933 --> 00:07:00,067
KIDNAPPING AND JUST BEING

280
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:01,133
RECOGNIZED AS A SENIOR AND

281
00:07:01,133 --> 00:07:02,200
PERIOD.

282
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,667
>> MM-HMM, I THINK YOU'RE DOING

283
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:04,533
GOOD.

284
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:06,233
YOU'RE NOT ALONE IN THIS, BUT IN

285
00:07:06,233 --> 00:07:08,067
A WAY YOU ARE ALONE IN THIS AS

286
00:07:08,067 --> 00:07:10,467
FAR AS THE DAD GOES.

287
00:07:10,467 --> 00:07:11,233
>> YEAH.

288
00:07:11,233 --> 00:07:12,633
>> WHEN THE BABY'S BORN, THE

289
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:14,667
MAIN THING IS HOW YOU'RE GONNA

290
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:17,567
HANDLE THE GETTING UP IN THE

291
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:18,767
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT, HOWEVER

292
00:07:18,767 --> 00:07:21,067
MANY TIMES IT TAKES.

293
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:22,933
IT KIND OF WORRIES ME HOW YOU'RE

294
00:07:22,933 --> 00:07:24,733
GONNA HANDLE IT YOURSELF, BUT I

295
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:27,067
MEAN, YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST THAT

296
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:28,633
SINCE YOU'VE NEVER HAD ACTUALLY

297
00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:30,933
A FATHER FIGURE TO SHOW YOU HOW

298
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:33,067
THE MAN IS SUPPOSED TO BE WITH

299
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:34,900
THE CHILD, YOU KNOW, SOMETIMES I

300
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,400
JUST WONDER HOW YOU'RE GONNA

301
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:39,633
REACT TO THE RESPONSIBILITY OF

302
00:07:39,633 --> 00:07:40,300
THE BABY.

303
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,467
I MEAN, OF COURSE, WE'LL ALWAYS

304
00:07:41,467 --> 00:07:44,167
BE THERE, BUT THE RESPONSIBILITY

305
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:48,233
OF YOU ACTUALLY ON YOUR OWN.

306
00:07:48,233 --> 00:07:49,367
>> THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT,

307
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:50,933
THE MORE I REALIZE, EVEN IF

308
00:07:50,933 --> 00:07:52,367
WE'RE NOT TOGETHER, MAURICE HAS

309
00:07:52,367 --> 00:07:55,833
TO STEP UP AND HELP OUT.

310

>> HAVE YOU GOTTEN ANYTHING FOR

317
00:08:11,867 --> 00:08:14,600
THE BABY?

318
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,333
>> I SAID, HAVE YOU GOTTEN

319
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:16,100
ANYTHING FOR THE BABY, SOME

320
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,067
DIAPERS OR SOMETHING?

321

>> OKAY, SO...

322
00:08:31,767 --> 00:08:32,800
>> WHY ARE YOU HAVING A SHOWER?

323
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,700
YOU'RE NOT THE MOM.

324
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,300
I'M SORRY, BUT THAT MAKES NO

325
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,300

I DON'T EVER SEE NOTHING.

I NEED TO SEE SOME ACTION.

334
00:08:54,933 --> 00:08:55,800
I'M NOT GONNA BE THE ONLY ONE

00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:03,367
>> YEAH.

376
00:10:03,367 --> 00:10:04,700
YEAH.

377
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,500
>> I JUST REALLY THINK THIS IS

378
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,933
JUST GONNA BE SO--IT'S GONNA BE

379
00:10:06,933 --> 00:10:08,733
JUDGE ARIANNA NIGHT.

380
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:09,600
>> IT'S NOT GONNA BE JUDGE

381
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,333
ARIANNA NIGHT.

382
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:12,000
>> AWW...

383
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,800
>> YOU LOOK SO PRETTY!

384
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,800
>> SHE LOOKS SO PRETTY.

385
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,167
[laughter]

386
00:10:21,167 --> 00:10:23,200
>> BYE.

387
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:23,867
>> LOVE YOU.

388
00:10:23,867 --> 00:10:25,800

* WE'LL GET FARTHER *

391
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,400
* FROM THIS DAY

392
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,267
* AWAY FROM YESTERDAY

393
00:10:33,267 --> 00:10:36,833
* I'LL KEEP THIS GOING AWAY *

394
00:10:36,833 --> 00:10:39,333
>> NO, NONE OF THAT.

395
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,133
>> * I'LL COME BACK *

396
00:10:40,133 --> 00:10:42,433

00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:44,767
* I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS *

398
00:10:44,767 --> 00:10:47,567
* I CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF THIS *

399
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:48,733
>> DANCING AND SEEING FRIENDS

400
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:49,700
WAS GREAT.

401
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,933
I WAS ABLE TO IGNORE THE LOOKS

402
00:10:50,933 --> 00:10:52,233
AND JUST HAVE FUN FOR A COUPLE

403
00:10:52,233 --> 00:10:53,233
HOURS.

404
00:10:53,233 --> 00:10:55,467
>> DID YOU LADIES HAVE FUN?

405
00:10:55,467 --> 00:10:56,833
>> YEAH, IT WAS COOL.

406
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,267
>> * I CAN'T GET ENOUGH *

407
00:10:58,267 --> 00:11:00,067
* OF THIS

408
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:00,833
>> ARE YOU GLAD YOU GOT OUT OF

409
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:01,467
THE HOUSE?

410
00:11:01,467 --> 00:11:02,700
>> YEAH, I DID HAVE FUN.

411
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,833
>> DID IT TAKE SOME OF YOUR MIND

412
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,100
OFF THE PRESSURES?

413
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,067
>> YES, IT DID.

414
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,200
>> THAT WAS THE GOAL.

415
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:08,933
ACCOMPLISHED!

416
00:11:08,933 --> 00:11:10,800
>> IT WAS, LIKE, I FELT LIKE I

417
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,067
WAS STUCK UNDER A ROCK, AND I,

418
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:13,200
LIKE, CAME OUT, AND I MISSED

419
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,067
SO MUCH.

420
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:15,200
IT MADE ME REALIZE HOW MUCH

421
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,367
I STAY IN THE HOUSE AND HOW MUCH

422
00:11:17,367 --> 00:11:19,367
I NEED TO GET OUT.

423
00:11:24,367 --> 00:11:25,667
I FEEL BAD ABOUT ALWAYS HAVING

424
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:27,067
TO DEPEND ON MY MOM TO DRIVE ME

425
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:27,967
EVERYWHERE.

426
00:11:27,967 --> 00:11:29,467
A BIG PART OF GETTING READY FOR

427
00:11:29,467 --> 00:11:30,800
AIDEN MEANS FINALLY GETTING MY

428
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,867
DRIVER'S LICENSE.

429
00:11:31,867 --> 00:11:33,500
>> PARALLEL PARKING, LET'S START

430
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,233
WITH THAT.

431
00:11:34,233 --> 00:11:36,600
I WANT TO SEE HOW GOOD OR HOW

432
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:37,267
BAD YOU ARE.

433
00:11:37,267 --> 00:11:38,233
>> [laughing] OKAY.

434
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:40,233
>> LET'S GO FOR IT.

435
00:11:42,267 --> 00:11:43,667
>> THAT FELT LIKE IT WAS--

436
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:44,500
YEAH.

437
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,967
>> UH, I THINK YOU JUST HIT A

438
00:11:45,967 --> 00:11:46,767
FERRARI.

439
00:11:46,767 --> 00:11:48,767
>> [laughs]

440
00:11:51,633 --> 00:11:52,867
I'M DUE IN EIGHT WEEKS, AND

441
00:11:52,867 --> 00:11:54,067
TODAY I HAVE A SONOGRAM

442
00:11:54,067 --> 00:11:54,867
APPOINTMENT.

443
00:11:54,867 --> 00:11:55,967
I'M STILL SO FRUSTRATED WITH

444
00:11:55,967 --> 00:11:57,200
MAURICE THAT I DIDN'T EVEN

445
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,133
BOTHER TELLING HIM ABOUT IT.

446
00:11:59,133 --> 00:12:00,433
>> OKAY!

447
00:12:00,433 --> 00:12:04,167
I'M EXCITED!

448
00:12:04,167 --> 00:12:05,533
>> LITTLE HEART.

449
00:12:05,533 --> 00:12:06,500
>> YOU CAN SEE HIS HEART BEATING

450
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,867
RIGHT HERE.

451
00:12:07,867 --> 00:12:09,500
>> AWW!

452
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:10,467
>> I'LL ENHANCE HIS HAND.

453
00:12:10,467 --> 00:12:11,867
>> [gasps]

454
00:12:11,867 --> 00:12:13,067
>> SEE HIS HANDS THERE?

455
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:15,267
>> OH, THEY'RE LIKE THIS.

456
00:12:15,267 --> 00:12:18,800
>> AWW!

457
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:19,733
>> WAIT, I WANT TO SEE WHAT HIS

458
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:21,933
LITTLE FEETS LOOK LIKE.

459
00:12:21,933 --> 00:12:23,200
>> I SEE HIS EYES--

460
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,167
BOTH EYES NOW AND HIS MOUTH.

461
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:27,700
>> OH, I KIND OF SAW, JUST A

462
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,767
LITTLE BIT.

463
00:12:28,767 --> 00:12:31,067
>> OH, I SEE IT!

464
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:32,100
[sorrowful guitar music]

465
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,900
*

466
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:37,867
>> * NOBODY'S PERFECT *

467
00:12:37,867 --> 00:12:40,067
>> THEY LOOK LIKE RICE'S LIMBS.

468
00:12:40,067 --> 00:12:46,300
>> * HOW COME YOU ARE?

469
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:49,733
*IF NOBODY'S PERFECT *

470
00:12:49,733 --> 00:12:51,067
>> AFTER SEEING MY BABY, I JUST

471
00:12:51,067 --> 00:12:51,967
COULDN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT

472
00:12:51,967 --> 00:12:53,967
HIM.

473
00:12:53,967 --> 00:12:55,467
AND THEN LATER THAT NIGHT, I HAD

474
00:12:55,467 --> 00:12:56,400
A DREAM THAT HE ASKED ME WHERE

475
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,800
HIS DADDY WAS, AND I DIDN'T KNOW

476
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:59,800
WHAT TO TELL HIM.

477
00:13:02,467 --> 00:13:03,767
I TEXTED MAURICE THAT I WANTED

478
00:13:03,767 --> 00:13:05,067
TO TALK FACE-TO-FACE, AND HE

479
00:13:05,067 --> 00:13:07,067
AGREED TO MEET UP.

480
00:13:07,067 --> 00:13:08,300
I KNOW AIDEN DESERVES TO HAVE

481
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,867
BOTH A MOM AND A DAD IN HIS

482
00:13:09,867 --> 00:13:11,500
LIFE, SO I'M WILLING TO GIVE

483
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,600
MAURICE ANOTHER CHANCE

484
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,767
TO MAN UP.

485
00:13:14,767 --> 00:13:15,967
>> I HOPE YOU HAVE A GOOD TALK.

486
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:17,300
>> I'M KIND OF LIKE, EH...

487
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,767
OKAY, YEAH, I HOPE I DO TOO.

488
00:13:19,767 --> 00:13:20,633
ALL RIGHT.

489
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:21,733
LOVE YOU.

490
00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:23,733
>> LOVE YOU.

491
00:13:28,867 --> 00:13:30,167
>> SUP, MAN?

492
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:33,800
>> HEY.

493
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,700

>> YEAH.

497
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,633
I THOUGHT IT'D BE BETTER IF WE

498
00:13:42,633 --> 00:13:44,300
CAME AND TALKED ABOUT HOW WE'RE

499
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,067
GONNA GO ABOUT DOING THINGS.

500
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:48,900
>> YOU KNOW THAT I'MA ALWAYS

501
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,067
MAKE SURE THAT I'M DOING MY

502
00:13:51,067 --> 00:13:52,067
PART, AND I'M ALWAYS THERE

503
00:13:52,067 --> 00:13:52,700
FOR YOU--

504
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,900
>> WELL, IT'S NOT REALLY ME

505
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,200
KNOWING BECAUSE, FINANCIALLY,

506
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,833
THINGS NEED TO BE BETTER ON YOUR

507
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,300
PART 'CAUSE OF COURSE I WOULD

508
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:03,300
ALREADY HAVE A JOB IF I WASN'T--

509
00:14:05,667 --> 00:14:06,967
>> BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT--

510
00:14:06,967 --> 00:14:09,767
BUT THAT'S NOT--IT IS AN ISSUE.

511
00:14:11,067 --> 00:14:12,200
>> EXACTLY, AND YOU SHOULD BE

512
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,067
DOING THAT.

513
00:14:13,067 --> 00:14:14,967
>> OKAY, BUT I TOLD YOU

514
00:14:14,967 --> 00:14:15,633
BEFORE THAT--

515
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:17,100
>> YOU TOLD ME A LOT OF THINGS,

516
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,067
BUT I NEED TO SEE IT.

517
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,300
YOU'RE NOT TRYING AS HARD AS

518
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,533
OTHER PEOPLE WHO REALLY TRY.

519
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:22,333
LIKE, I WOULD THINK--

520
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,600
>> DON'T TELL ME I'M NOT TRYING

521
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,933
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT WITH ME.

522
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:26,067
I MEAN, WE AIN'T BEEN TALKING.

523
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:27,233
WE AIN'T BEEN TOGETHER, SEEING

524
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:27,900
EACH OTHER.

525
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,067
>> RICE, I DON'T HAVE TO BE WITH

526
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:30,533
YOU UNLESS YOU'RE NOT SHOWING

527
00:14:30,533 --> 00:14:31,367
ANYTHING.

528
00:14:31,367 --> 00:14:32,800
>> JUST A LOT GOING ON.

529
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,267
>> WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOU?

530
00:14:34,267 --> 00:14:35,267
WHAT IS GOING ON IN YOUR LIFE

531
00:14:35,267 --> 00:14:37,467
THAT IS SO HARD THAT YOU CAN'T

532
00:14:37,467 --> 00:14:39,400
GET A 9:00 TO 5:00 JOB?

533
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,233
>> IT'S NOT EVEN ABOUT HAVING

534
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:40,900
A 9:00--

535
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,600
>> IT IS ABOUT HAVING A JOB.

536
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,600
YES, IT IS.

537
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,500
WE ARE HAVING A CHILD WHO NEEDS

538
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,600
THINGS WHICH COST MONEY.

539
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,800
>> MY FAMILY DONE BOUGHT PLENTY

540
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,467
OF THINGS.

541
00:14:50,467 --> 00:14:51,867
>> REALLY? WHERE'S IT AT?

542
00:14:51,867 --> 00:14:53,200
>> I WILL BRING EVERYTHING TO

543
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:54,300
YOUR HOUSE WHEN I FEEL LIKE IT'S

544
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,500
NECESSARY.

545
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,967
>> NO, IT'S NECESSARY NOW.

546
00:14:56,967 --> 00:14:59,067
>> HE'S NOT EVEN HERE YET.

547
00:14:59,067 --> 00:14:59,733
>> WHAT DOES IT MATTER?

548
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:00,700
YOU KNOW WHAT, AND THAT'S ONE

549
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,367
THING--

550
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:02,267
THAT'S ONE THING THAT I'MA

A BABY NEEDS BEFORE AND AFTER.

553
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:07,633
YOU CANNOT HAVE ZERO FOR A BABY

554
00:15:07,633 --> 00:15:08,500
AND HIM COME INTO THE WORLD,

555
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,300
"OH, WE JUST GONNA GO TO THE

00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:09,967
STORE."

557
00:15:09,967 --> 00:15:10,667
>> THAT'S THE THING.

558
00:15:10,667 --> 00:15:11,300
YOU SOUND DUMB.

559
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,133
>> NO, I DON'T SOUND DUMB.

560
00:15:12,133 --> 00:15:12,733
>> YOU SOUND DUMB.

561
00:15:12,733 --> 00:15:14,167
>> NO, ANOTHER THING, YOU'RE NOT

562
00:15:14,167 --> 00:15:14,833
GONNA TALK TO ME LIKE,

563
00:15:14,833 --> 00:15:15,600
"YOU'RE CRAZY."

564
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,067
DON'T DISRESPECT ME.

565
00:15:17,067 --> 00:15:17,933
>> YOU'RE CRAZY WHEN YOU'RE

566
00:15:17,933 --> 00:15:18,633
TELLING ME WHAT TO DO--

567
00:15:18,633 --> 00:15:20,967
>> NO, BECAUSE I'M DOING WHAT I

568
00:15:20,967 --> 00:15:21,767
GOT TO DO.

569
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:24,400
IT'S YOUR TURN.

570
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,267
AT THE END OF THE DAY, YOU'RE

571
00:15:25,267 --> 00:15:25,867
NOT GONNA CHANGE.

572
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:27,333
YOU'RE CHILDISH AND IF THIS

573
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,067
CONTINUES--

574
00:15:28,067 --> 00:15:29,400
>> ALL RIGHT, [bleep]. [bleep].

575
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,100
>> OKAY. WHATEVER.

576
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,467
[sighs]

577
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:52,900
[phone line ringing]

578
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,967
>> HELLO?

579
00:15:53,967 --> 00:15:55,067
>> MOM, IT WENT--

580
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:57,067
SO HE JUST WALKED OFF.

581
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:00,867
>> I HONESTLY DIDN'T THINK IT

582
00:16:00,867 --> 00:16:01,833
WOULD THAT BAD.

583
00:16:01,833 --> 00:16:02,767
I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD END THAT

584
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:04,667
QUICK.

585
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:05,800
>> ALL WE WAS TALKING ABOUT WAS

586
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,467
HOW HE JUST NEEDS TO GET JOB.

587
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,833
HE'S TALKING ABOUT, "OH, MY MOM

588
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:09,800
AND MY GRANDMA DONE BOUGHT A

589
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,767
WHOLE BUNCH OF STUFF."

590
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:11,767
AND I WAS LIKE, "OKAY, SO JUST

591
00:16:11,767 --> 00:16:12,833
BRING IT TO MY HOUSE."

592
00:16:12,833 --> 00:16:14,133
"I'LL BRING IT WHEN I FEEL IT,

593
00:16:14,133 --> 00:16:15,233
WHEN I FEEL LIKE IT, WHEN IT'S

594
00:16:15,233 --> 00:16:16,867
NECESSARY," HAVING A ATTITUDE.

595
00:16:16,867 --> 00:16:19,567
BUT I JUST--I WANTED IT TO WORK

596
00:16:19,567 --> 00:16:21,367
BECAUSE I JUST WANTED AIDEN TO

597
00:16:21,367 --> 00:16:23,100
BE ABLE TO NOT ONLY HAVE BOTH OF

598
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,100
HIS PARENTS IN HIS LIFE, BUT SEE

599
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,233
THAT BOTH OF HIS PARENTS CAN GET

600
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:28,233
ALONG VERY WELL.

601
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:38,933
>> YEAH.

602
00:16:38,933 --> 00:16:41,300
I LOVE YOU.

603
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:43,300
>> BYE.

604
00:16:53,467 --> 00:16:54,567
AIDEN'S DUE DATE IS LESS THAN

605
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:56,233
SIX WEEKS AWAY, AND TODAY IS MY

606
00:16:56,233 --> 00:16:57,567
BABY SHOWER.

607
00:16:57,567 --> 00:16:58,900
I'M EXCITED TO SEE MY FRIENDS

608
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,233
AND TO GET MORE THINGS FOR AIDEN

609
00:17:00,233 --> 00:17:01,600
IN A WAY THAT ISN'T ALL ON MY

610
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,867
MOM AND GRANDMA.

611
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:05,967
>> HI!

612
00:17:05,967 --> 00:17:06,833
>> HELLO.

613
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,367
>> HOW ARE YOU?

614
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,167
>> THERE WE GO.

615
00:17:15,167 --> 00:17:18,133
SO HOW IS REGULAR TEENAGER LIFE?

616
00:17:18,133 --> 00:17:19,167
>> A STRUGGLE.

617
00:17:19,167 --> 00:17:20,533
>> A STRUGGLE.

618
00:17:20,533 --> 00:17:21,600
>> IT'S A STRUGGLE.

619
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,333
>> Y'ALL ARE SENIORS.

620
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,933
I WANT TO BE A SENIOR AT SCHOOL.

621
00:17:23,933 --> 00:17:24,900
>> WE CAN BRING YOU A SHIRT.

622
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,633
THAT'S ABOUT IT.

623
00:17:25,633 --> 00:17:29,067
[laughter]

624
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:29,867
>> ONE STARTING TALKING RIGHT

625
00:17:29,867 --> 00:17:31,133
HERE, I'M JUST LIKE, "START

626
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:31,800
OVER."

627
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,867
>> [laughing]

628
00:17:33,867 --> 00:17:35,867
OKAY, NOW THIS IS CUTE.

629
00:17:37,433 --> 00:17:39,967
AH, THIS SMELL'S LIKE--

630
00:17:39,967 --> 00:17:41,533
I'LL LET YOU SMELL MY DIAPERS.

631
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:42,733
>> I COULDN'T GET ANY WRAPPING

632
00:17:42,733 --> 00:17:43,700
PAPER.

633
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,600
[laughter]

634
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,400
>> THIS IS MY FAVORITE BAG OUT

635
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,467
OF ALL THE BAGS.

636
00:17:47,467 --> 00:17:49,167
>> THANK YOU.

637
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:51,667
>> AWW!

638
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:52,733
>> AWW!

639
00:17:52,733 --> 00:17:53,667
>> THIS IS THE HAPPIEST I'VE

640
00:17:53,667 --> 00:17:54,633
SEEN YOU IN A MINUTE.

641
00:17:54,633 --> 00:17:55,867
>> 'CAUSE Y'ALL ARE HILARIOUS.

642
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:56,933
>> DID YOU HAVE A GOOD TIME?

643
00:17:56,933 --> 00:17:58,300
>> YES, I DID.

644
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:58,967
>> GOOD.

645
00:17:58,967 --> 00:17:59,767
>> I JUST WANT TO HAVE A BABY

646
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:00,967
SHOWER EVERY DAY.

647
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:02,633
>> SEE, I CAN'T AFFORD THAT.

648
00:18:02,633 --> 00:18:04,633
>> [laughing]

649
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:09,067
MY DUE DATE IS ONLY THREE WEEKS

650
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:10,733
AWAY, AND I HAVEN'T HEARD A WORD

651
00:18:10,733 --> 00:18:12,067
FROM MAURICE.

652
00:18:12,067 --> 00:18:13,367
I'M GLAD THAT WE'RE ALL DOING

653
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:14,300
SOMETHING TOGETHER.

654
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,900
>> YEAH, IT'S FUN.

655
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:17,067
>> IT'S HARD FOR ME TO GET OVER

656
00:18:17,067 --> 00:18:18,433
MY DISAPPOINTMENT WITH HIM, BUT

657
00:18:18,433 --> 00:18:19,433
I'M TRYING TO TAKE MY MIND OFF

658
00:18:19,433 --> 00:18:20,967
THINGS BY FOCUSING ON GETTING

659
00:18:20,967 --> 00:18:22,400
READY FOR AIDEN TO BE HERE AND

660
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,767
SPENDING TIME WITH FRIENDS.

661
00:18:26,567 --> 00:18:28,533
>> [laughs]

662
00:18:28,533 --> 00:18:31,633
>> WHOO!

663
00:18:31,633 --> 00:18:33,200
>> HELLO!

664
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:35,200
>> HEY.

665
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,300
>> I DON'T KNOW.

666
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,533
SO HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

667
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:42,967
>> I HAVE BEEN TIRED AND SLEEPY

668
00:18:42,967 --> 00:18:44,367
ALL THE TIME.

669
00:18:44,367 --> 00:18:45,500
>> BUT IT'S EXCITING.

670
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,400
LIKE, YOU HAVE, LIKE, A COUPLE

671
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,567
OF WEEKS TO GO.

672
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:49,633
>> YEAH.

673
00:18:49,633 --> 00:18:50,600
>> YOU'RE DOING WHAT YOU HAVE TO

674
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,733
DO FOR YOUR BABY.

675
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:53,200
IN COLLEGE, WHAT DO YOU PLAN ON

676
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,167
STUDYING?

677
00:18:54,167 --> 00:18:55,800
>> I WANTED, YOU KNOW, TO GO GET

678
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:59,067
MY PhD IN PSYCHOLOGY, BUT THAT

679
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:01,567
TAKES 11 YEARS.

680
00:19:01,567 --> 00:19:02,667
NOW I HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE

681
00:19:02,667 --> 00:19:03,833
BABY, SO I HAVE TO GO WITH

682
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:05,833
PLAN B, MAJOR IN REGISTERED

683
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:06,633
NURSING.

684
00:19:06,633 --> 00:19:08,100
IT'S JUST, LIKE, ANOTHER ONE OF

685
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,400
THE SACRIFICES YOU HAVE TO MAKE

686
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,333
BY GETTING PREGNANT WHEN YOU'RE

687
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,167
YOUNG.

688
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:13,067
>> SO, LIKE, WHERE DO YOU AND

689
00:19:13,067 --> 00:19:14,333
RICE STAND NOW?

690
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:15,667
>> WE'RE NOT TOGETHER.

691
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:17,300
AFTER THAT WHOLE PATERNITY TEST

692
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,267
THING, AFTER THAT IT'S, LIKE,

693
00:19:18,267 --> 00:19:19,367
NO.

694
00:19:19,367 --> 00:19:20,433
AND THEN HE KEEPS SAYING THAT

695
00:19:20,433 --> 00:19:23,300
HE'S TRYING TO GET A JOB, AND HE

696
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,733
DOESN'T GET A JOB.

697
00:19:24,733 --> 00:19:26,067
IF IT WASN'T FOR MY MOM AND MY

698
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:27,167
GRANDMOTHER, MY BABY WOULD HAVE

699
00:19:27,167 --> 00:19:29,267
NOTHING RIGHT NOW, LIKE,

700
00:19:29,267 --> 00:19:30,167
NOTHING.

701
00:19:30,167 --> 00:19:31,400
SO, LIKE, I FINALLY REALIZED

702
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,933
THAT, LIKE, HE'S ALL TALK AND NO

703
00:19:33,933 --> 00:19:35,300
ACTION.

704
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,067
>> HAVE YOU TOLD HIM HOW YOU

705
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:36,733
FELT ABOUT EVERYTHING?

706
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:38,067
>> OH, YEAH, PLENTY OF TIMES.

707
00:19:38,067 --> 00:19:39,067
I'VE TOLD HIM HOW I FELT PLENTY

708
00:19:39,067 --> 00:19:40,100
OF TIMES, AND IT JUST DOESN'T

709
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:40,767
CHANGE.

710
00:19:40,767 --> 00:19:41,567
LIKE, I GET THE SAME RESPONSE

711
00:19:41,567 --> 00:19:42,400
FROM HIM, WHICH IS DIFFERENT

712
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:43,167
FROM HIS ACTIONS.

713
00:19:43,167 --> 00:19:44,200
>> SO I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY RIGHT

714
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,333
NOW IT HASN'T HIT HIM, BUT WHEN

715
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,433
IT DOES, I MEAN, IT'S GONNA HIT

716
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:48,167
HIM HARD.

717
00:19:48,167 --> 00:19:49,700
>> I HOPE IT DOES. I REALLY DO.

718
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,600
I HOPE THAT--I REALLY HOPE HE

719
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,267
CAN CHANGE.

720
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:52,267
IT'S NOT LIKE I WANT HIM TO BE,

721
00:19:52,267 --> 00:19:54,067
LIKE, A BAD PERSON SO I COULD

722
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:54,900
ALWAYS PUT HIM DOWN LIKE, "YEAH,

723
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:55,867
YOU AIN'T NEVER BEEN THERE," AND

724
00:19:55,867 --> 00:19:56,800
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH LIKE A LOT OF

725
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,500
GIRLS WANT TO DO.

726
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,767
I WANT TO SEE HIM DO GOOD.

727
00:19:58,767 --> 00:20:01,067
I REALLY TRULY DO FOR THE BABY.

728
00:20:01,067 --> 00:20:02,933
IT'D BE GREAT FOR ME TOO, BUT

729
00:20:02,933 --> 00:20:03,900
IT'S NOT ABOUT ME.

730
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,233
IT'S REALLY ABOUT AIDEN, AND I

731
00:20:05,233 --> 00:20:08,333
JUST WANT HIM TO BE A GOOD DAD,

732
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,767
AND THAT'S REALLY IT.

733
00:20:09,767 --> 00:20:10,533
LIKE, I'M NOT ASKING FOR

734
00:20:10,533 --> 00:20:11,633
ANYTHING MORE, AND I DON'T THINK

735
00:20:11,633 --> 00:20:12,767
THAT'S TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR

736
00:20:12,767 --> 00:20:13,633
ANYWAYS.

737
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:14,800
>> YEAH.

738
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,967
>> AS MUCH AS I WANTED MAURICE

739
00:20:15,967 --> 00:20:17,067
TO HELP ME PREPARE BEFORE THE

740
00:20:17,067 --> 00:20:19,700
BABY COMES, HE ISN'T GONNA HAVE

741
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,167
A CHANCE NOW BECAUSE WHEN I WENT

742
00:20:21,167 --> 00:20:22,300
FOR MY WEEKLY CHECKUP, THE

743
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,467
DOCTOR WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE

744
00:20:23,467 --> 00:20:24,567
BABY'S MEASUREMENTS, SO HE

745
00:20:24,567 --> 00:20:26,300
DECIDED TO INDUCE ME RIGHT AWAY.

746
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:30,200
>> UGH!

GETTING ALONG, I WANT TO LET

749

MAURICE KNOW THE BABY'S COMING.

750
00:20:36,767 --> 00:20:39,133
OKAY, I'M GONNA CALL RICE.

[phone line ringing]

752
00:20:46,367 --> 00:20:48,800
>> YEAH, I'M IN THE HOSPITAL.

753
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,567
THEY'RE GONNA INDUCE ME AND

754
00:20:50,567 --> 00:20:53,267
DELIVER TODAY RIGHT NOW.

755
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,700
>> THAT'S UP TO YOU.

>> I FEEL LIKE I NEED MORE

757
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:28,467
OXYGEN.

758
00:21:28,467 --> 00:21:30,833
>> OH! I LOVE IT.

759
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,833
>> THAT'S WONDERFUL.

760
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,767
GRANDMA...

761
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:42,300
IT'S HURTING IN MY BACK LIKE YOU

762
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,567
SAID.

763
00:21:43,567 --> 00:21:45,467
>> I WOULDN'T LIE TO YOU.

764
00:21:45,467 --> 00:21:47,067
>> I KNOW.

765
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:49,067
OW!

766
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:52,067
EVEN THOUGH I WAS WORRIED ABOUT

767
00:21:52,067 --> 00:21:53,700
HAVING HIM HERE, BEING IN LABOR

768
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,800
IS REALLY SCARY, AND MAURICE IS

769
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,333
BEING SWEET AND HELPFUL, AND I'M

770
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,333
ACTUALLY HAPPY HE'S HERE.

771
00:22:09,933 --> 00:22:11,933

773
00:22:23,067 --> 00:22:25,600
SO BAD...

774
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,933
WHEN THE PAIN STARTED TO GET

775
00:22:26,933 --> 00:22:28,167
UNBEARABLE, I ASKED FOR AN

776
00:22:28,167 --> 00:22:30,167
EPIDURAL.

777
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,133
>> ARE YOU ALL READY?

778
00:22:36,133 --> 00:22:36,800
>> YES.

779
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,467
>> YEAH.

780
00:22:37,467 --> 00:22:39,133
>> YES. YES. YES.

781
00:22:39,133 --> 00:22:40,367

* I DON'T WANT TO GO *

786
00:22:53,967 --> 00:22:58,067
* WITHOUT YOU

>> GRANDMA.

789
00:23:01,067 --> 00:23:03,333
>> YOU'RE MY LITTLE PRECIOUS,

790
00:23:03,333 --> 00:23:05,400
PRECIOUS SWEET PEA.

791
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,100
LITTLE SWEET PEA.

* WITHOUT YOU

796
00:23:39,667 --> 00:23:42,300
>> WHAT MADE YOU CALL ME?

797
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,633
>> WHAT I WANT IS...

798
00:23:47,067 --> 00:23:48,567
DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A REASON.

799
00:23:48,567 --> 00:23:50,467
I JUST CALLED.

800
00:23:50,467 --> 00:23:52,100
>> SEEING HIM BEING BORN JUST

801
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:55,300
MEANT THE WORLD TO ME.

802
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:57,067
>> I JUST WISH THAT EVERYTHING

803
00:23:57,067 --> 00:23:59,167
WASN'T SO LAST-MINUTE.

804
00:24:06,233 --> 00:24:07,467
>> OH, YEAH?

805
00:24:07,467 --> 00:24:09,467
HE'S HERE NOW.

806
00:24:15,767 --> 00:24:16,433
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN,

807
00:24:16,433 --> 00:24:18,133
"IT'S OVER WITH?"

808
00:24:18,133 --> 00:24:20,133
>> THE SITUATION.

809
00:24:24,667 --> 00:24:25,967
LITTLE AIDEN WAS GONNA BE TAKEN

810
00:24:25,967 --> 00:24:28,100
CARE OF THE RIGHT WAY.

811
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,133
>> YEAH, HE WAS BY MY MOM AND

812
00:24:30,133 --> 00:24:32,267
GRANDMOTHER FOR THE MOST PART.

813
00:24:32,267 --> 00:24:33,800
THAT'S WHAT MADE ME ANGRY.

814
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:35,867
I'M JUST BEING HONEST WITH YOU.

815
00:24:35,867 --> 00:24:36,667
I'M NOT TRYING TO CAUSE AN

816
00:24:36,667 --> 00:24:38,067
ARGUMENT, BUT THAT'S JUST

817
00:24:38,067 --> 00:24:39,967
HONESTY, AND IT COULD CHANGE.

818
00:24:39,967 --> 00:24:42,433
I'M NOT SAYING IT CAN'T, BUT IT

819
00:24:42,433 --> 00:24:44,200
COULD HAVE BEEN A LONG TIME AGO.

820
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,200
>> COULD HAVE BEEN.

821
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:02,533
>> DON'T COME BACK TO MY

822
00:25:02,533 --> 00:25:03,967
HOSPITAL.

823
00:25:03,967 --> 00:25:05,133
YOU NEED TO OWN UP TO WHAT YOU

824
00:25:05,133 --> 00:25:06,600
DID WRONG, MAURICE.

825
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,400
YOU JUST NEED TO, AND IF YOU

826
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,800
CAN'T, I DON'T WANT YOU AROUND

827
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,133
ME BECAUSE YOU NEED TO BE MAN

828
00:25:11,133 --> 00:25:11,967
ENOUGH TO KNOW WHAT YOU DID

829
00:25:11,967 --> 00:25:14,400
WRONG.

830
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,600
>> GIVE ME MY BABY.

831
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:19,433
GIVE ME--

IF YOU DO NOT GIVE ME MY CHILD

834
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,100
AND GET OUT OF MY ROOM RIGHT

835
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,233
NOW.

836
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:25,333
>> YOU'VE BEEN HOLDING HIM.

837
00:25:25,333 --> 00:25:26,267
GIVE ME MY CHILD AND GET OUT OF

838
00:25:26,267 --> 00:25:26,933
MY ROOM.

839
00:25:26,933 --> 00:25:28,933
YOU'RE STRESSING ME OUT.

840

>> I NEED A NURSE IN MY ROOM

841
00:25:36,067 --> 00:25:37,067
PLEASE.

842
00:25:37,067 --> 00:25:39,067
>> OKAY.

843

>> ALL I WANTED WAS A SIMPLE

844
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,933
OWNING UP.

845
00:26:02,933 --> 00:26:03,733
JUST OWN UP TO WHAT YOU DID IN

846
00:26:03,733 --> 00:26:04,700
THE PAST.

847
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:05,700
THAT'S IT.

848
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,600
"NOT GOING TO BECAUSE I DIDN'T

849
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,333
DO NOTHING WRONG."

850
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:09,767
>> NOW THAT YOU'VE TRIED...

851
00:26:09,767 --> 00:26:11,100

GET UGLY NOW, MAYBE I MADE A--

00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,067
OH, WHAT'S WRONG?

855
00:26:14,067 --> 00:26:16,067
>> YOU MADE A MISTAKE BY WHAT?

856
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,667
WHEN I ASK YOU TO GIVE ME MY

857
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:23,067
BABY BACK, YOU GIVE ME MY BABY

858
00:26:23,067 --> 00:26:24,467
BACK.

859
00:26:24,467 --> 00:26:26,667
>> IF HE'S LIKE THAT THE SAME

860
00:26:26,667 --> 00:26:29,333
DAY HE WAS BORN, YOU DO NEED TO

861
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:31,333
DISTANCE FROM HIM.

862
00:26:34,233 --> 00:26:35,400
>> HOW'S MY BABY?

863
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,833
>> HE'S GREAT.

864
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:38,133
WITH AIDEN BEING BORN AND

865
00:26:38,133 --> 00:26:39,167
EVERYTHING, THAT WAS LIKE, YOU

00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,433
>> YEAH.

00:26:47,267 --> 00:26:49,067
>> LIKE, WHAT HAPPENED?

872
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:50,300
>> SHE WAS LIKE, STARTED

LIKE, "OH, YOU WASN'T HERE FOR

875
00:26:53,833 --> 00:26:55,267
THE WHOLE NINE MONTHS," OR LIKE,

876
00:26:55,267 --> 00:26:57,333
"YOU WASN'T DOING NOTHING," OR

877
00:26:57,333 --> 00:26:58,167
WHATEVER, BLAH, BLAH, AND SHE

878
00:26:58,167 --> 00:26:59,067
WAS LIKE, "WELL, YOU SHOULD HAVE

879
00:26:59,067 --> 00:26:59,767
DID THIS."

880
00:26:59,767 --> 00:27:00,900
I'M LIKE, "ALL RIGHT, BUT IT

881
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,067
WASN'T DONE, SO..."

SHE'S SO DRAMATIC.

AT THIS POINT, I DON'T WANT TO

892

DEAL WITH HER, BUT AT THE SAME

893
00:27:14,833 --> 00:27:15,933
TIME, I JUST WANT TO SEE HIM.

894
00:27:15,933 --> 00:27:16,833
>> I KNOW.

895
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:17,933
I WAS THINKING THE SAME THING.

896

DIFFICULT FOR ME.

900
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:25,767
I'M TIRED OF IT.

901

SINCE I KICKED HIM OUT OF THE

903

HOSPITAL.

904
00:27:36,433 --> 00:27:37,667
EVEN THOUGH I'M EXCITED TO BE

905
00:27:37,667 --> 00:27:39,067
TAKING AIDEN HOME, I HATE THAT

906
00:27:39,067 --> 00:27:40,600
I HAVE TO DO THIS ALONE.

907
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:43,267
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

>> I'M NOT REALLY FOCUSED ON ANY

915

NEGATIVE STUFF RIGHT NOW.

916
00:27:54,533 --> 00:27:56,533
I'M JUST FOCUSED ON GETTING THE

917
00:27:56,533 --> 00:27:57,600
BABY HOME AND GETTING HIM

918
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,100
SETTLED.

919
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,733
RICE HAS NOT TRIED TO ASK ABOUT

920
00:28:00,733 --> 00:28:03,467
THE BABY, SO UNLESS HE CALLS OR,

921
00:28:03,467 --> 00:28:04,800
YOU KNOW, TRIES TO MAKE ANY TYPE

922
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,667
OF EFFORT, I WOULD RATHER JUST

923
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:06,933
NOT EVEN TALK TO ABOUT HIM FOR

924
00:28:06,933 --> 00:28:08,067
THE REST OF THE DAY 'CAUSE HE

925
00:28:08,067 --> 00:28:09,067
BRINGS UP NEGATIVE ENERGY, AND

926
00:28:09,067 --> 00:28:10,067
I DON'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT

927
00:28:10,067 --> 00:28:11,067
RIGHT NOW.

928
00:28:11,067 --> 00:28:11,700
>> OKAY.

929
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:12,600
>> BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO ENJOY

930
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:14,100
THESE MOMENTS WITH MY BABY.

>> RIGHT.

932
00:28:14,833 --> 00:28:16,833

992
00:30:22,233 --> 00:30:23,233
TAKING CARE OF AIDEN HAS BEEN

993
00:30:23,233 --> 00:30:25,333
HARDER THAN I THOUGHT.

I GUESS I FINALLY GOT THROUGH TO

1015
00:32:00,700 --> 00:32:02,100
MAURICE BECAUSE A WEEK LATER, HE

1016
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,700
TEXTED ME THAT HE GOT A JOB AND

1017
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,867

>> THINGS ARE STARTING TO

1086
00:33:54,533 --> 00:33:56,167
ACTUALLY LOOK UP WITH HIM FOR

1087

MONEY FOR IT, HE'LL BRING IT BY.

1095

HE'S ON THE RIGHT PATH RIGHT

1097
00:34:07,633 --> 00:34:08,867
NOW, AND BEFORE HE WASN'T EVEN

1098

ON THE RIGHT PATH.

ABOUT IS OUR RELATIONSHIP

GOING TO BE RECOVERED.

1108
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,200
IT'S KIND OF, LIKE, I'M STILL

1109
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:23,700
MAD AT HIM FOR THINGS THAT HE

1110
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:26,100
DID WHEN I WAS PREGNANT, SO

1111
00:34:26,100 --> 00:34:27,133
NO MATTER IF ME AND MAURICE WORK

1112
00:34:27,133 --> 00:34:28,433
OUT, THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO

1113
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:30,067
ME IS THAT AIDEN HAVE BOTH

1114
00:34:30,067 --> 00:34:31,267
PARENTS IN HIS LIFE.

1115
00:34:31,267 --> 00:34:32,800
I'M TRYING TO GET THERE.

1116
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,167
>> YEAH, I UNDERSTAND.
