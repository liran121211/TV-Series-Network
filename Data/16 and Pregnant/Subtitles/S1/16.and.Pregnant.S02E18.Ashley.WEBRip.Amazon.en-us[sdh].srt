1
00:00:04,305 --> 00:00:05,106
>> GOOD?

2
00:00:05,106 --> 00:00:05,806
>> YEAH.

3
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:06,840
HI, MY NAME'S ASHLEY,

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,342
AND I'M FROM MCKINNEY, TEXAS,

5
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:09,643
A SUBURB OF DALLAS,

6
00:00:09,643 --> 00:00:10,678
BUT I'M ORIGINALLY FROM

7
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:12,546
WAY SOUTH TEXAS, WHERE MOST OF

8
00:00:12,546 --> 00:00:14,082
MY FAMILY STILL LIVES.

9
00:00:14,082 --> 00:00:15,349
AND IN MY HOUSE,

10
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:16,717
IT'S JUST US GIRLS:

11
00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:18,586
ME; MY LITTLE SISTER, MIA;

12
00:00:18,586 --> 00:00:19,287
AND MY MOM.

13
00:00:19,287 --> 00:00:20,221
>> DO YOU WANT TO GO PLAY?

14
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:21,055
>> SURE.

15
00:00:21,055 --> 00:00:22,123
>> MY BIOLOGICAL DAD

16
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:23,424
HAS NEVER BEEN AROUND.

17
00:00:23,424 --> 00:00:25,359
MY MOM AND I ARE VERY CLOSE,

18
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:26,994
BECAUSE SHE HAD ME WHEN SHE WAS

19
00:00:26,994 --> 00:00:28,229
19 YEARS OLD.

20
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:29,263
BUT I HAVE BIG PLANS

21
00:00:29,263 --> 00:00:30,531
TO LEAVE THE NEST SOON

22
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:31,465
AND MAKE IT ON MY OWN

23
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:32,500
IN NEW YORK.

24
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,034
I WANT TO GO TO COLLEGE THERE

25
00:00:34,034 --> 00:00:35,769
AND BECOME A PHOTOJOURNALIST.

26
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:37,405
MY BOYFRIEND, JUSTIN, AND I

27
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:38,706
RECENTLY BROKE UP,

28
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:40,408
SO I'M FOCUSING MORE ON WRITING

29
00:00:40,408 --> 00:00:41,442
AND SCHOOL NOW.

30
00:00:41,442 --> 00:00:43,111
I EVEN STARTED MY OWN BLOG.

31
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:44,011
I'M ABOUT TO START

32
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:45,513
MY SENIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL,

33
00:00:45,513 --> 00:00:46,947
AND I PLAN TO GRADUATE EARLY

34
00:00:46,947 --> 00:00:48,649
TO GET MY REAL LIFE STARTED.

35
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:49,483
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE

36
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:50,484
GOING TO THE BIG APPLE

37
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:51,552
MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT,

38
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:54,922
BECAUSE I'M PREGNANT.

39
00:01:04,598 --> 00:01:05,766
I'M ALMOST FIVE MONTHS ALONG,

40
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:06,767
AND I JUST FOUND OUT

41
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:07,868
I'M HAVING A GIRL.

42
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:09,603
SHE'S DUE ON CHRISTMAS DAY.

43
00:01:09,603 --> 00:01:10,638
IT'S FUNNY TO THINK

44
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:11,805
THAT I'VE BEEN PREGNANT LONGER

45
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,407
THAN JUSTIN, THE BABY'S FATHER,

46
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:15,042
AND I WERE EVEN TOGETHER.

47
00:01:15,042 --> 00:01:16,144
I DON'T EVEN SEE WHY

48
00:01:16,144 --> 00:01:18,011
I HAVE TO EAT BREAKFAST ANYWAY.

49
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:19,046
>> YOU HAVE TO.

50
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:20,381
IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT MEAL.

51
00:01:20,381 --> 00:01:22,082
>> I NEVER ATE IT LAST YEAR.

52
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:22,983
>> LAST YEAR, YOU WEREN'T

53
00:01:22,983 --> 00:01:23,784
PREGNANT, AND THIS YEAR,

54
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:24,485
YOU ARE.

55
00:01:24,485 --> 00:01:25,453
>> MY MOM'S BEEN REALLY

56
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:26,454
SUPPORTIVE, BUT I STILL

57
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:27,621
HAVEN'T DECIDED IF I'M READY

58
00:01:27,621 --> 00:01:28,789
TO RAISE A BABY.

59
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:29,723
WE WENT THROUGH THIS WHOLE THING

60
00:01:29,723 --> 00:01:30,524
FOR, LIKE, A MONTH.

61
00:01:30,524 --> 00:01:31,492
>> YEAH, YOU WERE IN DENIAL

62
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:32,393
FOR, LIKE, A MONTH,

63
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:33,261
AND YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.

64
00:01:33,261 --> 00:01:34,128
>> I WASN'T IN DENIAL.

65
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:35,196
I JUST REALLY THOUGHT, LIKE--

66
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:36,230
>> LIKE IT WAS GOING TO GO AWAY?

67
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:37,030
>> YEAH.

68
00:01:37,030 --> 00:01:37,965
>> YOU WERE, LIKE,

69
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:39,467
HAVING NERVOUS BREAKDOWNS AND--

70
00:01:39,467 --> 00:01:40,168
>> I WASN'T HAVING

71
00:01:40,168 --> 00:01:40,934
A NERVOUS BREAKDOWN.

72
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:41,702
>> YOU WOULD GET ALL

73
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:42,703
STRESSED OUT AND THEN SAY,

74
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,138
"UGH, I'M JUST SO HUNGRY."

75
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:45,373
AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, MY GOSH,

76
00:01:45,373 --> 00:01:46,407
WHAT'S WRONG WITH"--

77
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:47,141
REMEMBER THAT?

78
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:47,875
>> NO.

79
00:01:47,875 --> 00:01:48,676
>> I KNEW.

80
00:01:48,676 --> 00:01:49,677
AND WE TALKED ABOUT

81
00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:51,279
THE THREE DIFFERENT OPTIONS.

82
00:01:51,279 --> 00:01:52,246
AND, YOU KNOW, IF YOU WANTED

83
00:01:52,246 --> 00:01:53,181
TO HAVE AN ABORTION, FINE.

84
00:01:53,181 --> 00:01:54,081
HAVE YOUR ABORTION.

85
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:55,216
IF YOU WANTED TO GIVE IT UP

86
00:01:55,216 --> 00:01:56,384
FOR ADOPTION, FINE.

87
00:01:56,384 --> 00:01:57,351
I'M GOING TO SUPPORT YOU.

88
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:58,719
BUT WHEN, YOU KNOW,

89
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,753
YOU CONSIDERED KEEPING IT,

90
00:01:59,753 --> 00:02:02,190
I WAS JUST LIKE, "[bleep]."

91
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,257
I STARTED TO PANIC

92
00:02:03,257 --> 00:02:04,425
A LITTLE BIT, 'CAUSE IF YOU WERE

93
00:02:04,425 --> 00:02:05,226
GOING TO KEEP THE BABY,

94
00:02:05,226 --> 00:02:06,160
THINGS ARE GOING TO HAVE

95
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,027
TO CHANGE.

96
00:02:07,027 --> 00:02:08,028
WE WANT YOU TO FINISH SCHOOL.

97
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:09,663
>> THAT'S TRUE, BUT I JUST

98
00:02:09,663 --> 00:02:10,798
WANT HER TO HAVE, LIKE,

99
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:12,132
A STAY-AT-HOME MOM.

100
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,000
>> WELL, I CAN'T DO IT.

101
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,134
I'M A SINGLE MOM, AND I WORK,

102
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,203
YOU KNOW, A FULL-TIME JOB.

103
00:02:15,203 --> 00:02:16,337
AND SO MY ROLE'S GOING

104
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:17,405
TO HAVE TO BE FINANCIAL.

105
00:02:17,405 --> 00:02:18,306
WE'D HAVE TO PAY A NANNY

106
00:02:18,306 --> 00:02:19,106
TO RAISE IT.

107
00:02:19,106 --> 00:02:19,940
I CAN'T STAY HOME.

108
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,275
>> YUP.

109
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:22,576
>> SO DO YOU CONSIDER

110
00:02:22,576 --> 00:02:24,412
KEEPING IT STILL?

111
00:02:24,412 --> 00:02:25,779
>> OF COURSE I WANT TO.

112
00:02:25,779 --> 00:02:27,581
IT'S JUST REALLY OVERWHELMING

113
00:02:27,581 --> 00:02:29,717
AND STRESSFUL.

114
00:02:29,717 --> 00:02:31,118
>> YOU'RE STILL A KID.

115
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:32,820
>> EVEN IF MY MOM DOES HELP ME

116
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,087
FINANCIALLY, THE BABY

117
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:35,055
WOULD STILL HAVE TO GO

118
00:02:35,055 --> 00:02:36,624
TO A DAYCARE, AND I'D STILL

119
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:37,591
HAVE TO GIVE UP GOING

120
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:38,959
TO COLLEGE IN NEW YORK.

121
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:39,860
IF MY MOM'S LIFE

122
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:40,961
IS ANY INDICATION,

123
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:42,196
RAISING A BABY ALONE

124
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:44,164
MEANS SACRIFICING EVERYTHING.

125
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,267
SHE DOES WELL NOW BUT ONLY

126
00:02:46,267 --> 00:02:49,237
BECAUSE SHE WORKS NONSTOP.

127
00:02:49,237 --> 00:02:50,771
NOW THAT I'M THINKING ABOUT

128
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:52,373
MY OWN BABY AND HER FATHER,

129
00:02:52,373 --> 00:02:53,541
I WONDER WHAT OUR LIVES

130
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:54,375
WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKE

131
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,210
HAD MY OWN DAD STUCK AROUND.

132
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,345
MAKING THIS DECISION

133
00:02:57,345 --> 00:02:58,212
MIGHT BE DIFFERENT

134
00:02:58,212 --> 00:02:59,347
IF THIS BABY'S FATHER WERE

135
00:02:59,347 --> 00:03:00,681
IN THE PICTURE, BUT HEAND I

136
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:02,250
DIDN'T DATE FOR VERY LONG,

137
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,084
AND WE'RE NOT REALLY IN TOUCH.

138
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:05,118
SO YOU TALK TO JUSTIN LATELY,

139
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:06,354
THE JERK?

140
00:03:06,354 --> 00:03:07,054
>> NO.

141
00:03:07,054 --> 00:03:07,921
>> IS JUSTIN GOING TO BE

142
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:09,257
A SENIOR AGAIN?

143
00:03:09,257 --> 00:03:10,991
>> HE GRADUATED LAST YEAR,

144
00:03:10,991 --> 00:03:12,025
THANK GOD.

145
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:13,461
I DON'T KNOW HOW.

146
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:14,228
>> REMEMBER WHEN WE, LIKE,

147
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:14,995
FIRST MET HIM?

148
00:03:14,995 --> 00:03:15,763
YOU THOUGHT HE WAS, LIKE,

149
00:03:15,763 --> 00:03:16,430
SO CUTE.

150
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,498
>> HE USED TO, LIKE--

151
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:18,966
>> SLEEP IN CLASS.

152
00:03:18,966 --> 00:03:20,401
>> YEAH, AND HE WAS REALLY CUTE.

153
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:21,302
>> HOW LONG WERE Y'ALL DATING

154
00:03:21,302 --> 00:03:22,570
BEFORE Y'ALL HAD SEX?

155
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,471
>> LIKE, TWO MONTHS.

156
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:24,805
WE ONLY DID IT ONE TIME ANYWAY.

157
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:25,906
>> JUST THE ONCE?

158
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:26,774
>> MM-HMM.

159
00:03:26,774 --> 00:03:27,841
>> WHY DIDN'T YOU USE A CONDOM?

160
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:28,542
OR DID Y'ALL?

161
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:30,344
>> NO. I MEAN, WE DIDN'T.

162
00:03:30,344 --> 00:03:31,879
IT WAS JUST SPUR OF THE MOMENT.

163
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:32,780
I GUESS WE DIDN'T REALLY

164
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,081
THINK OF IT AS A BIG DEAL.

165
00:03:34,081 --> 00:03:35,449
BUT I GUESS IT IS.

166
00:03:35,449 --> 00:03:36,450
>> REMEMBER THAT DAY,

167
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,785
THE ACTUAL DAY?

168
00:03:37,785 --> 00:03:38,819
>> IT WAS PHYSICAL FITNESS DAY

169
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:39,787
AT SCHOOL?

170
00:03:39,787 --> 00:03:41,589
[laughter]

171
00:03:41,589 --> 00:03:42,523
>> YOU HAD YOUR PHYSICAL

172
00:03:42,523 --> 00:03:44,024
THAT DAY.

173
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:45,459
YOU COULDN'T EVEN RUN.

174
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:46,894
>> NO, SHELLEY, STOP.

175
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:49,830
[laughter]

176
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:50,898
I REALLY REGRET IT.

177
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,066
LIKE, REALLY REGRET IT.

178
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:54,302
MY FRIENDS ARE REALLY

179
00:03:54,302 --> 00:03:55,469
SUPPORTIVE, AND THEY HELP ME

180
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:57,371
LAUGH ABOUT THE WHOLE SITUATION.

181
00:03:57,371 --> 00:03:58,839
BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS,

182
00:03:58,839 --> 00:04:00,040
I NEED TO GET SERIOUS

183
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,042
AND MAKE A DECISION.

184
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:03,577
AND THAT MEANS I HAVE TO TALK

185
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:04,978
TO JUSTIN AND FIND OUT

186
00:04:04,978 --> 00:04:07,080
WHERE HE STANDS.

187
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,449
I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM

188
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:09,617
SINCE HIS MOM KICKED HIM OUT

189
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:10,918
FOR GETTING ME PREGNANT,

190
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:12,019
SO AFTER MY LAST DAY

191
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:13,053
OF SUMMER CLASSES

192
00:04:13,053 --> 00:04:14,221
AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE,

193
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:15,823
I CALLED HIM, AND HE AGREED

194
00:04:15,823 --> 00:04:16,957
TO MEET WITH ME.

195
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:17,825
>> HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

196
00:04:17,825 --> 00:04:18,659
>> GOOD.

197
00:04:18,659 --> 00:04:19,960
>> IT'S NICE SEEING YOU.

198
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:22,530
>> YEAH.

199
00:04:22,530 --> 00:04:24,031
>> IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

200
00:04:24,031 --> 00:04:24,965
>> LIKE, THE LAST DAY OF SCHOOL,

201
00:04:24,965 --> 00:04:26,534
I THINK, WAS THE LAST TIME

202
00:04:26,534 --> 00:04:27,601
I SAW YOU.

203
00:04:27,601 --> 00:04:28,536
>> YEAH, WE DIDN'T GET ALONG

204
00:04:28,536 --> 00:04:29,337
TOO WELL.

205
00:04:29,337 --> 00:04:30,270
>> YOU WERE, LIKE, MEAN

206
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,138
WHEN I TOLD YOU.

207
00:04:31,138 --> 00:04:32,205
>> I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU.

208
00:04:32,205 --> 00:04:33,607
>> YOU WERE LIKE, "OH, I THINK

209
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:34,675
YOU JUST WANT TO GET BACK

210
00:04:34,675 --> 00:04:36,243
TOGETHER WITH ME" OR SOMETHING.

211
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:37,077
>> I GUESS YOU CAN SAY

212
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:40,080
I WAS KIND OF A [bleep].

213
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,615
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW

214
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:42,883
IF I WANT TO KEEP IT

215
00:04:42,883 --> 00:04:44,585
OR, LIKE, DO ADOPTION OR NOT.

216
00:04:44,585 --> 00:04:45,919
SO HOW DO YOU FEEL?

217
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,220
LIKE, I KNOW WE DIDN'T WORK OUT,

218
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,522
LIKE, TOGETHER OR ANYTHING,

219
00:04:48,522 --> 00:04:50,358
BUT IT'S STILL, LIKE,

220
00:04:50,358 --> 00:04:53,026
YOUR KID, SORT OF.

221
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:54,362
>> WELL, IT IS MY KID.

222
00:04:54,362 --> 00:04:55,929
>> DO YOU JUST, LIKE, NOT CARE?

223
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:57,164
LIKE, OR ARE YOU--

224
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:58,198
>> NO, DON'T THINK

225
00:04:58,198 --> 00:04:59,099
THAT I DON'T WANT TO HAVE

226
00:04:59,099 --> 00:04:59,933
ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT.

227
00:04:59,933 --> 00:05:00,634
I JUST--

228
00:05:00,634 --> 00:05:01,301
>> YOU DON'T?

229
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,870
>> NO, I WOULD.

230
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,271
LIKE, IF I HAD THE MONEY

231
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:07,240
AND ALL THAT, I WOULD LOVE

232
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,742
TO HELP TAKE CARE OF IT.

233
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:10,077
BUT I DON'T REALLY WANT

234
00:05:10,077 --> 00:05:10,978
THE BABY GROWING UP

235
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:11,779
THE WAY I DID.

236
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,080
I WANT IT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE

237
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,214
EVERYTHING IT NEEDS.

238
00:05:14,214 --> 00:05:15,383
>> WHERE ARE YOU NOW?

239
00:05:15,383 --> 00:05:16,517
LIKE, WHERE ARE YOU STAYING?

240
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:17,685
>> MY MOM WON'T LET ME COME

241
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:18,952
BACK HOME, SO I JUST SLEEP

242
00:05:18,952 --> 00:05:20,654
IN MY FRIEND'S CAR, SO...

243
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:21,922
AND I'M ALSO PROBABLY GOING

244
00:05:21,922 --> 00:05:23,824
TO JOIN THE MILITARY.

245
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:25,526
I NEED MY LIFE BACK ON TRACK

246
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:28,829
AND EVERYTHING.

247
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:30,263
>> WITHOUT HAVING A DAD

248
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:31,765
TO SHARE THE RESPONSIBILITY,

249
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:33,133
I'M NOT SURE I SHOULD BE RAISING

250
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:38,539
THIS BABY AT ALL.

251
00:05:38,539 --> 00:05:40,007
I'VE BEEN USING MY BLOG

252
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,208
TO TALK ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE

253
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,643
AS A PREGNANT TEEN,

254
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:43,677
AND I HOPE THAT SHARING

255
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:44,778
MY THOUGHTS WILL HELP ME

256
00:05:44,778 --> 00:05:46,113
TO COME TO A DECISION.

257
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:47,448
IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS NOW

258
00:05:47,448 --> 00:05:48,649
THAT JUSTIN'S IN NO POSITION

259
00:05:48,649 --> 00:05:50,117
TO BE A DAD, AND I KNOW

260
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:51,184
HOW HARD IT WOULD BE

261
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,620
TO BE A SINGLE PARENT.

262
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,987
SO I NEED TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK

263
00:05:53,987 --> 00:05:54,822
AT ADOPTION.

264
00:05:54,822 --> 00:05:55,756
MY MOM AND I FOUND

265
00:05:55,756 --> 00:05:57,057
AN ADOPTION AGENCY.

266
00:05:57,057 --> 00:05:58,091
NOW A SOCIAL WORKER

267
00:05:58,091 --> 00:05:59,259
IS COMING OVER

268
00:05:59,259 --> 00:06:00,861
TO GIVE US MORE INFORMATION.

269
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,763
>> HI, I'M ASHLEY.

270
00:06:02,763 --> 00:06:03,964
>> HI, ASHLEY. I'M DEBBIE.

271
00:06:03,964 --> 00:06:04,998
GOOD TO MEET YOU.

272
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:05,966
COME ON IN.

273
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:06,667
>> THANKS.

274
00:06:06,667 --> 00:06:07,968
I'M ASHLEY.

275
00:06:07,968 --> 00:06:08,669
>> I'M ASHLEY.

276
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:09,570
>> NICE TO MEET YOU.

277
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,171
>> YOU TOO.

278
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:12,473
>> THANKS.

279
00:06:12,473 --> 00:06:13,474
SO I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU

280
00:06:13,474 --> 00:06:15,543
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR OPTIONS.

281
00:06:15,543 --> 00:06:16,477
TELL ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

282
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:17,445
WHEN Y'ALL FIRST STARTED TALKING

283
00:06:17,445 --> 00:06:19,547
ABOUT THE IDEA OF PARENTING

284
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:20,648
OR ADOPTION.

285
00:06:20,648 --> 00:06:22,015
I MEAN, WHO WAS THE FIRST PERSON

286
00:06:22,015 --> 00:06:23,684
TO KIND OF PUT THE IDEA

287
00:06:23,684 --> 00:06:25,318
OF ADOPTION OUT ON THE TABLE?

288
00:06:25,318 --> 00:06:26,554
>> BOTH MY MOM AND I,

289
00:06:26,554 --> 00:06:28,355
WE CONSIDERED EVERY OPTION.

290
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:29,122
>> DO YOU FEEL LIKE

291
00:06:29,122 --> 00:06:30,090
YOU HAVE OPTIONS?

292
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,024
I MEAN, DO YOU FEEL LIKE

293
00:06:31,024 --> 00:06:33,093
PARENTING IS AN OPTION?

294
00:06:33,093 --> 00:06:34,261
>> IT'D JUST BE, LIKE,

295
00:06:34,261 --> 00:06:36,029
A STRUGGLE FOR EVERYONE.

296
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,498
>> THIS IS PROBABLY

297
00:06:37,498 --> 00:06:39,232
THE MOST DIFFICULT DECISION

298
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:40,067
THAT YOU WILL MAKE

299
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:41,702
IN YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.

300
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:43,270
IF YOU COULD PUT YOURSELF

301
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:45,439
IN THE HOSPITAL TODAY, I MEAN,

302
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,674
WHAT WOULD YOU EXPECT

303
00:06:46,674 --> 00:06:48,709
FROM YOURSELF, DO YOU THINK?

304
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:50,143
>> I DON'T KNOW,

305
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:51,144
JUST THAT I KNOW

306
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,112
IT'S GOING TO BE HARD.

307
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:53,380
>> IT'S A REALLY HARD--

308
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:54,882
IT'S EXTREMELY HARD

309
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:58,118
TO CARRY HER FOR NINE MONTHS

310
00:06:58,118 --> 00:06:59,887
AND TO LOVE HER

311
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:00,788
AND TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF

312
00:07:00,788 --> 00:07:01,889
AND TAKE CARE OF YOUR BODY

313
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:06,927
AND GO IN AND DELIVER

314
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,530
AND GO HOME WITHOUT HER.

315
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:11,331
IT'S REALLY, REALLY HARD.

316
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:12,132
>> YEAH.

317
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:14,602
>> AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT,

318
00:07:14,602 --> 00:07:15,435
I CAN'T MAKE THAT BETTER

319
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,303
FOR YOU.

320
00:07:16,303 --> 00:07:17,304
>> YEAH.

321
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:18,405
I THINK ADOPTION

322
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:19,573
IS THE BEST CHOICE FOR ME,

323
00:07:19,573 --> 00:07:20,741
BUT AM I STRONG ENOUGH

324
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:23,043
TO GO THROUGH WITH IT?

325
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:30,784
>> I'M RUNNING OUT OF OPTIONS.

326
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,452
[alarm ringing]

327
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:33,521
BUT I CAN'T THINK ABOUT THAT

328
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:34,822
RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE THIS IS

329
00:07:34,822 --> 00:07:35,856
THE FIRST DAY

330
00:07:35,856 --> 00:07:37,424
OF MY SENIOR YEAR.

331
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:38,626
EVERYONE KNEW I WAS PREGNANT

332
00:07:38,626 --> 00:07:39,960
WHEN I LEFT, BUT NOW

333
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,094
THAT I'M ACTUALLY SHOWING,

334
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:42,362
I'M WORRIED ABOUT FEELING

335
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:43,597
AWKWARD.

336
00:07:43,597 --> 00:07:44,998
DOES THIS LOOK OKAY?

337
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,233
>> YOU LOOK CUTE.

338
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:48,401
>> I JUST FEEL REALLY FAT.

339
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,436
>> YOU'RE NOT FAT;

340
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:50,370
YOU'RE PREGNANT.

341
00:07:50,370 --> 00:07:51,404
>> I KNOW.

342
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:52,239
>> ARE YOU NERVOUS?

343
00:07:52,239 --> 00:07:53,240
>> I'M NOT NERVOUS.

344
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:58,245
IT'S, LIKE, DREAD.

345
00:07:58,245 --> 00:08:00,147
I'M GETTING A LOT MORE NERVOUS

346
00:08:00,147 --> 00:08:01,014
NOW THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY

347
00:08:01,014 --> 00:08:02,182
GETTING THERE OR WHATEVER.

348
00:08:02,182 --> 00:08:02,950
>> REALLY?

349
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,051
I'M GOING NOW, AND I'LL BE

350
00:08:04,051 --> 00:08:05,152
AT SCHOOL IN, LIKE,

351
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,053
MAYBE TEN MINUTES.

352
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:07,220
>> OKAY, YEAH, JUST TRY

353
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,657
AND BE THERE AS FAST AS YOU CAN.

354
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:11,424
SINCE I ONLY HAVE THREE CREDITS

355
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:12,893
LEFT TO GRADUATE, THE SCHOOL

356
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:14,294
DECIDED I'D GET THOSE

357
00:08:14,294 --> 00:08:15,663
IN CREDIT RECOVERY,

358
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:16,930
EVEN THOUGH IT'S A PROGRAM

359
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,298
FOR FAILING STUDENTS.

360
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:19,833
IT'S OKAY, BECAUSE IT MEANS

361
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,234
I CAN BE DONE WITH SCHOOL

362
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:26,173
BEFORE THE BABY IS BORN.

363
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,641
>> HOW WAS SCHOOL?

364
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:28,776
>> THE ONLY PART I SAW

365
00:08:28,776 --> 00:08:29,743
OF THE SCHOOL WAS

366
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:32,012
CREDIT RECOVERY, I.S.S.

367
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:32,713
>> YOU WENT

368
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:33,547
TO IN-SCHOOL SUSPENSION?

369
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:34,414
>> THAT'S WHERE THEY TOLD ME

370
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:34,982
TO GO.

371
00:08:34,982 --> 00:08:35,749
>> YOU'RE IN TROUBLE

372
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:36,950
FOR BEING PREGNANT.

373
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,018
>> I KNOW; I DON'T HAVE CLASS

374
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:38,919
WITH ANYBODY

375
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,187
EXCEPT SOME NEW GUY.

376
00:08:40,187 --> 00:08:41,254
I THINK HE'S, LIKE,

377
00:08:41,254 --> 00:08:42,355
ON HOUSE ARREST OR SOMETHING,

378
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,291
'CAUSE HE HAD AN ANKLE BRACELET.

379
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,659
[laughter]

380
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:46,594
>> THANKS.

381
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:47,494
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

382
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:48,361
>> I THOUGHT YOUR PARENTS

383
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,229
WERE GOING TO MAKE YOU

384
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:49,930
STOP TALKING TO ME,

385
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:50,631
BUT THEY DIDN'T.

386
00:08:50,631 --> 00:08:51,431
>> LIKE, IF I HANG OUT

387
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:52,265
WITH A PREGNANT PERSON,

388
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:53,133
I'M GOING TO GET PREGNANT?

389
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,167
[laughter]

390
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:55,035
ARE YOU EXCITED TO SEE

391
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,403
WHAT SHE LOOKS LIKE?

392
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:58,271
>> A LITTLE.

393
00:08:58,271 --> 00:08:59,339
KIND OF SAD.

394
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:00,608
>> ARE YOU, LIKE, POSITIVE

395
00:09:00,608 --> 00:09:01,709
YOU WANT TO DO ADOPTION?

396
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:02,643
>> NO.

397
00:09:02,643 --> 00:09:03,443
>> YOU'RE NOT?

398
00:09:03,443 --> 00:09:04,377
>> MM-MM.

399
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,312
>> FOR ME, I DON'T THINK

400
00:09:05,312 --> 00:09:06,346
I WOULD WANT TO GIVE THE BABY

401
00:09:06,346 --> 00:09:07,748
AWAY, BUT, LIKE, IT GIVES YOU

402
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:09,282
A BETTER OPPORTUNITY,

403
00:09:09,282 --> 00:09:10,584
AND IT GIVES, LIKE, THE BABY

404
00:09:10,584 --> 00:09:12,219
A BETTER OPPORTUNITY.

405
00:09:12,219 --> 00:09:13,120
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

406
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,054
>> THAT'S ACTUALLY A GOOD POINT.

407
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:14,955
LIKE, I DIDN'T WANT TO SOUND,

408
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:16,089
LIKE, SELFISH, 'CAUSE I'M NOT.

409
00:09:16,089 --> 00:09:17,090
>> YEAH, LIKE, IT'S GOING

410
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,059
TO BE BETTER FOR HER TOO.

411
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:21,595
>> I DON'T WANT TO, BUT SHE'LL

412
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:22,896
PROBABLY EXCEL MORE

413
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:25,032
THAN I PROBABLY COULD LET HER.

414
00:09:25,032 --> 00:09:25,866
>> YEAH.

415
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:26,834
>> I JUST THINK

416
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:29,603
THAT'S THE BEST THING.

417
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:33,040
YEAH.

418
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,307
I KNOW IT'S NOT GOING

419
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:35,876
TO BE EASY, BUT I'VE FINALLY

420
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:37,044
COME TO THE CONCLUSION

421
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:38,178
THAT ADOPTION IS DEFINITELY

422
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:40,580
THE RIGHT CHOICE.

423
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,882
IT WOULD BE BEST TO GIVE

424
00:09:41,882 --> 00:09:43,516
THIS BABY TO A FAMILY THAT CAN

425
00:09:43,516 --> 00:09:44,685
LOVE AND PROVIDE FOR HER.

426
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:46,519
SHE WILL HAVE A STAY-AT-HOME MOM

427
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,221
AND A LOVING DADDY.

428
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:50,157
TWO GREAT PARENTS--THAT'S WHAT

429
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:51,959
I WANT FOR MY BABY.

430
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:53,293
IT'S A RELIEF TO HAVE MADE

431
00:09:53,293 --> 00:09:54,527
A DECISION.

432
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:55,328
>> ASHLEY.

433
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:56,363
>> HI.

434
00:09:56,363 --> 00:09:57,898
DO YOU HAVE MY BLINK-182 SHIRT

435
00:09:57,898 --> 00:09:58,832
THAT I LEFT HERE?

436
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:01,635
>> YEAH, I DO, ACTUALLY.

437
00:10:01,635 --> 00:10:02,703
>> 'CAUSE I REALLY DON'T THINK

438
00:10:02,703 --> 00:10:04,104
THIS IS GOING TO FIT.

439
00:10:04,104 --> 00:10:05,405
FINALLY, I CAN TAKE A BREAK

440
00:10:05,405 --> 00:10:06,974
FROM ALL OF THIS ADOPTION TALK

441
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:08,341
AND HAVE SOME FUN.

442
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,276
I'VE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD

443
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:11,845
TO THIS CONCERT FOR MONTHS.

444
00:10:11,845 --> 00:10:14,748
[rock music]

445
00:10:14,748 --> 00:10:17,284
[crowd cheering]

446
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:32,565
GOING TO A CONCERT PREGNANT,

447
00:10:32,565 --> 00:10:33,667
IT'S NOT AT ALL

448
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:38,171
LIKE IT USED TO BE.

449
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:40,140
IT'S TIME FOR ANOTHER CHECKUP.

450
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,041
MY MOM IS MEETING ME

451
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,309
AT THE ULTRASOUND TO SEE

452
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:43,911
HOW MY BABY IS GROWING.

453
00:10:43,911 --> 00:10:44,945
>> THERE'S THE LITTLE FACE,

454
00:10:44,945 --> 00:10:46,013
AND THERE'S THE BABY'S

455
00:10:46,013 --> 00:10:47,147
LITTLE NOSE AND LIPS.

456
00:10:47,147 --> 00:10:48,048
>> WHOA, WHOA.

457
00:10:48,048 --> 00:10:49,016
HOW CUTE.

458
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:50,350
>> THAT'S A LOT MORE DETAILED

459
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,284
THAN LAST TIME.

460
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:52,185
>> SHE'S GROWING

461
00:10:52,185 --> 00:10:53,353
EXACTLY HOW SHE SHOULD

462
00:10:53,353 --> 00:10:54,554
AND LOOKS NORMAL.

463
00:10:54,554 --> 00:10:56,156
THERE YOU GO.

464
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,491
YOU'RE WELCOME.

465
00:10:58,491 --> 00:11:00,193
>> THIS IS GOING TO BE HARDER

466
00:11:00,193 --> 00:11:01,561
THAN I THOUGHT.

467
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:02,863
I MADE THE ADOPTION DECISION,

468
00:11:02,863 --> 00:11:04,197
BUT NOW I HAVE TO DEAL WITH

469
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:05,632
THE PRACTICALITIES.

470
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:06,599
LIKE, I STILL HAVE TO CARRY

471
00:11:06,599 --> 00:11:08,301
THIS BABY, WHICH MEANS

472
00:11:08,301 --> 00:11:09,937
GETTING MATERNITY CLOTHES.

473
00:11:09,937 --> 00:11:11,004
>> LOOK ON THAT SIDE

474
00:11:11,004 --> 00:11:12,439
FOR A STORE CALLED PICKLES

475
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:13,473
AND ICE CREAM.

476
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:14,241
THERE IT IS.

477
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:15,042
>> WHY IS IT CALLED PICKLES

478
00:11:15,042 --> 00:11:15,743
AND ICE CREAM?

479
00:11:15,743 --> 00:11:16,609
>> BECAUSE THEY SAY

480
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:17,444
THAT WHEN YOU'RE PREGNANT,

481
00:11:17,444 --> 00:11:18,345
YOU LIKE WEIRD THINGS

482
00:11:18,345 --> 00:11:19,713
LIKE PICKLES AND ICE CREAM.

483
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:24,451
>> I WANT ICE CREAM.

484
00:11:24,451 --> 00:11:25,919
>> IT'S ON SALE.

485
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:26,887
NO?

486
00:11:26,887 --> 00:11:28,856
>> NO.

487
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:37,998
>> DO YOU SEE ANYTHING ELSE,

488
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:38,932
BABY?

489
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:39,699
>> NOT OVER HERE.

490
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,500
>> YOU DON'T LIKE THAT

491
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,201
RIGHT NOW.

492
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,303
>> UH-UH.

493
00:11:43,303 --> 00:11:45,005
I WISH WE COULD BUY, LIKE,

494
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:46,506
A COUPLE OUTFITS OR WHATEVER

495
00:11:46,506 --> 00:11:50,477
FOR THE FIRST TWO DAYS.

496
00:11:53,246 --> 00:11:54,014
>> IT'S JUST HARD.

497
00:11:54,014 --> 00:11:54,915
I MEAN, I'M AFRAID YOU'RE

498
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,149
GOING TO GET ATTACHED AND--

499
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,250
>> WELL, I'M NOT GOING

500
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:59,119
TO BACK OUT.

501
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:00,587
>> [sighs]

502
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:02,589
>> OKAY.

503
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:06,860
MOM, DON'T.

504
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,162
>> ARE YOU OKAY?

505
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:12,265
IT'S OKAY.

506
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:17,737
I'M TRYING TO BE REALLY STRONG

507
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,505
THE WHOLE TIME.

508
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:20,841
IT'S JUST HARD.

509
00:12:20,841 --> 00:12:22,375
I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO SEE ME,

510
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:23,676
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE

511
00:12:23,676 --> 00:12:25,012
A TOUGH TIME WITH YOUR DECISION.

512
00:12:25,012 --> 00:12:26,046
>> NO, IT'S OKAY.

513
00:12:26,046 --> 00:12:26,880
I'M HAVING A TOUGH TIME

514
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,481
ON MY OWN.

515
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,682
>> I JUST THINK YOU'RE GOING

516
00:12:29,682 --> 00:12:30,483
TO HAVE A HARD TIME,

517
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:32,552
AND I THINK I'M GOING

518
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:33,620
TO HAVE A HARD TIME.

519
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:35,923
AND I JUST DON'T WANT YOU

520
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:36,857
TO STRUGGLE.

521
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:39,659
I DON'T WANT YOU TO SUFFER.

522
00:12:52,205 --> 00:12:53,473
>> BECAUSE CREDIT RECOVERY

523
00:12:53,473 --> 00:12:55,142
LETS YOU STUDY AT YOUR OWN PACE,

524
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:56,443
I WORKED REALLY HARD TO FINISH

525
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:57,744
ALL OF MY COURSES

526
00:12:57,744 --> 00:12:59,346
AND GRADUATED EARLY.

527
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:00,513
MY MOM PLANNED A BIG DINNER

528
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:01,748
WITH THE WHOLE FAMILY

529
00:13:01,748 --> 00:13:02,850
TO CELEBRATE.

530
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:03,884
THE FAMILY IS ALL

531
00:13:03,884 --> 00:13:05,152
A TEN-HOUR DRIVE AWAY,

532
00:13:05,152 --> 00:13:06,286
BUT GRADUATION

533
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:07,487
IS AN IMPORTANT EVENT,

534
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:08,588
SO EVERYONE--

535
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:10,723
MY UNCLE KENNY; HIS WIFE, LISA,

536
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:11,624
WHO I'VE ALWAYS BEEN

537
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:12,826
REALLY CLOSE TO;

538
00:13:12,826 --> 00:13:14,794
AND THEIR TWO KIDS--SHOWED UP.

539
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,963
WE SPEND EVERY HOLIDAY

540
00:13:15,963 --> 00:13:17,730
AND EVERY SUMMER TOGETHER,

541
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,232
SO IT'S JUST NOT A CELEBRATION

542
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:20,267
WITHOUT THEM.

543
00:13:20,267 --> 00:13:21,168
>> THANK YOU.

544
00:13:21,168 --> 00:13:22,435
I LIKE THAT ONE.

545
00:13:22,435 --> 00:13:24,004
>> EVERYONE LIKES MONEY.

546
00:13:24,004 --> 00:13:26,439
>> OH, MY GOSH.

547
00:13:26,439 --> 00:13:28,741
[all gasps]

548
00:13:28,741 --> 00:13:29,877
THANK YOU.

549
00:13:29,877 --> 00:13:31,144
>> AND I WANT TO JUST

550
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,412
CONGRATULATE ASHLEY

551
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:33,246
FOR HER ACHIEVEMENT

552
00:13:33,246 --> 00:13:34,547
WITH HIGH SCHOOL,

553
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:35,949
AND I PRAY THAT SHE GOES ON

554
00:13:35,949 --> 00:13:37,951
TO COLLEGE, HOPEFULLY MAKES

555
00:13:37,951 --> 00:13:39,186
WISE DECISIONS

556
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:41,688
FROM HERE ON OUT.

557
00:13:41,688 --> 00:13:43,223
>> HOPEFULLY.

558
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:44,691
TO WISE DECISIONS.

559
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:45,926
>> WISE DECISIONS.

560
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:46,826
>> MY FAMILY IS DOING

561
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:47,727
THEIR BEST.

562
00:13:47,727 --> 00:13:48,728
THERE'S A LOT FOR THEM

563
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:49,829
TO GET USED TO.

564
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,064
BUT IT ALWAYS FEELS LIKE

565
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:52,432
MY AUNT LISA UNDERSTANDS

566
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:53,766
WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH.

567
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:54,701
>> SO YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY

568
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:55,568
MORE EMOTIONAL WHEN YOU'RE

569
00:13:55,568 --> 00:13:57,037
TALKING ABOUT CERTAIN THINGS.

570
00:13:57,037 --> 00:13:58,338
HAVE YOU BEEN SURPRISED

571
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,540
AT HOW YOU'RE FEELING?

572
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,042
>> LIKE, SOMETIMES I'M, LIKE,

573
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:04,577
JUST REALLY, "OKAY, WHATEVER,"

574
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:05,612
LIKE, HAPPY ABOUT IT.

575
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:07,214
AND SOMETIMES I JUST GET

576
00:14:07,214 --> 00:14:07,915
NOT IN THE MOOD.

577
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:08,681
>> YOU JUST DON'T WANT

578
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,349
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

579
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,283
>> YEAH.

580
00:14:10,283 --> 00:14:11,518
AND THEN I GUESS MAYBE

581
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:12,419
IT'S, LIKE, MIXED

582
00:14:12,419 --> 00:14:13,620
WITH FRUSTRATION AND SADNESS

583
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,521
OR SOMETHING.

584
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:15,422
I'M JUST LIKE--

585
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:16,623
>> MM.

586
00:14:16,623 --> 00:14:17,757
>> SINCE EVERYBODY'S LEFT

587
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:18,959
AND THE GRADUATION CELEBRATION

588
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,527
IS OVER, IT'S TIME TO GET BACK

589
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:21,962
TO REALITY AND MOVE FORWARD

590
00:14:21,962 --> 00:14:23,363
WITH THIS ADOPTION PLAN.

591
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:24,397
>> WE JUST DISCUSSED

592
00:14:24,397 --> 00:14:25,798
HER OPTIONS, AND SHE HAD SAID

593
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:26,934
SHE WAS GOING TO GO

594
00:14:26,934 --> 00:14:27,968
WITH ADOPTION.

595
00:14:27,968 --> 00:14:29,236
>> LIKE, I WISH I COULD

596
00:14:29,236 --> 00:14:31,838
HAVE KIDS NOW OR A KID NOW,

597
00:14:31,838 --> 00:14:33,040
BUT I CAN'T.

598
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,074
>> I NEVER MET A BIRTH MOTHER

599
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:35,275
WHO DOESN'T WISH

600
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:36,143
THAT THEY COULD PARENT,

601
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:37,110
THAT THEIR CIRCUMSTANCE

602
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,011
WASN'T DIFFERENT.

603
00:14:38,011 --> 00:14:39,312
THAT'S REALLY, REALLY NORMAL.

604
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:40,613
YOU KNOW, THE NEXT STEP

605
00:14:40,613 --> 00:14:42,549
IS GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR

606
00:14:42,549 --> 00:14:43,917
ADOPTIVE PARENTS.

607
00:14:43,917 --> 00:14:45,452
DO Y'ALL HAVE ANY SPECIFIC

608
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:46,686
FEARS, CONCERNS?

609
00:14:46,686 --> 00:14:47,620
>> I GUESS NOT CHOOSING

610
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,455
THE RIGHT ONES.

611
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:50,290
LIKE, WHAT IF I CHOOSE ONE

612
00:14:50,290 --> 00:14:51,458
AND I'M, LIKE, KIND OF IFFY

613
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,392
ABOUT THEM?

614
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:53,460
>> I KNOW RIGHT NOW

615
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,294
YOU HAVE NO IDEA

616
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:55,395
EVEN WHO THESE PEOPLE ARE.

617
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:56,796
IT'S LIKE A BLACK HOLE.

618
00:14:56,796 --> 00:14:58,165
I MEAN, IN YOUR HEAD,

619
00:14:58,165 --> 00:14:59,066
"WHERE IS MY CHILD GOING?

620
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:00,333
I HAVE NO IDEA."

621
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,601
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT.

622
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,103
BUT WE WANT YOU TO WALK AWAY

623
00:15:03,103 --> 00:15:05,338
FEELING PEACEFUL ABOUT THIS,

624
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:06,039
THAT YOU MADE

625
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:07,274
THE RIGHT DECISION,

626
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:09,109
YOU'RE CONFIDENT IN YOUR PLAN

627
00:15:09,109 --> 00:15:10,410
AND WHO'S RAISING YOUR CHILD.

628
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:11,311
I MEAN, THOSE ARE

629
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:13,646
THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS.

630
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:14,814
OKAY?

631
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:15,482
>> OKAY.

632
00:15:15,482 --> 00:15:16,283
>> WE'LL PLAN A TIME

633
00:15:16,283 --> 00:15:17,284
TO COME BACK OUT, BUT KNOW

634
00:15:17,284 --> 00:15:18,185
THAT IF ANYTHING COMES UP,

635
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:19,352
YOU CAN ALWAYS CALL.

636
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:20,420
>> THANKS FOR COMING OUT.

637
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,588
>> OKAY, WELL, Y'ALL HAVE

638
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:22,622
A GOOD WEEK, AND THANK YOU

639
00:15:22,622 --> 00:15:23,356
SO MUCH.

640
00:15:23,356 --> 00:15:24,057
>> THANK YOU.

641
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:25,558
YOU TOO.

642
00:15:25,558 --> 00:15:27,160
>> I SHOULD BE STUDYING

643
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:29,062
FOR THE S.A.T.s, BUT INSTEAD

644
00:15:29,062 --> 00:15:30,797
I WENT TO THE ADOPTION AGENCY'S

645
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:33,100
WEBSITE TO CHECK OUT PROFILES.

646
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,167
I TOLD MY CASE WORKER

647
00:15:34,167 --> 00:15:35,735
FROM THE ADOPTION AGENCY

648
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:36,936
THAT CHOOSING ADOPTIVE PARENTS

649
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,205
FELT OVERWHELMING,

650
00:15:38,205 --> 00:15:39,672
SO SHE SUGGESTED I TALK

651
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:40,940
TO A GIRL WHO HAD RECENTLY

652
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:42,475
BEEN THROUGH THE SAME THING.

653
00:15:42,475 --> 00:15:44,444
>> WELL, DO YOU HAVE ANY THINGS

654
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,346
THAT YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT

655
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:47,814
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?

656
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:49,249
>> I'M WORRIED ABOUT, LIKE,

657
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:51,084
ADOPTIVE FAMILIES.

658
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:51,918
>> IT'S SAD.

659
00:15:51,918 --> 00:15:53,153
LIKE, I FELT SO BAD

660
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:54,221
FOR ALL THOSE PEOPLE.

661
00:15:54,221 --> 00:15:55,022
>> YEAH.

662
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:55,955
>> I HAVE TO PICK THE ONES

663
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:56,823
THAT I LIKE THE BEST.

664
00:15:56,823 --> 00:15:57,690
>> I KNOW.

665
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:58,525
LIKE, I HAVE A HARD TIME

666
00:15:58,525 --> 00:15:59,526
TRUSTING THEM.

667
00:15:59,526 --> 00:16:01,094
>> IT'S NOT LIKE YOU CAN'T EVER

668
00:16:01,094 --> 00:16:02,562
SEE YOUR BABY AGAIN.

669
00:16:02,562 --> 00:16:04,697
LIKE, I HAD A VISITATION

670
00:16:04,697 --> 00:16:05,898
WITH MY BABY, AND HE WAS, LIKE,

671
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:06,833
FOUR MONTHS.

672
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,201
LIKE, I GOT UPSET, BECAUSE,

673
00:16:08,201 --> 00:16:09,502
LIKE, HE DIDN'T WANT ME.

674
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:10,770
HE WANTED HER.

675
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:11,704
>> THAT'S SO SAD.

676
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,440
>> AND I WAS LIKE, "WHY DOES HE

677
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,841
WANT YOU AND NOT ME?"

678
00:16:14,841 --> 00:16:16,076
>> THAT'S LIKE--I FEEL LIKE

679
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:16,976
THAT'S HOW I'LL BE.

680
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,345
LIKE, I'LL FEEL, LIKE, ANGRY

681
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:19,746
AT THEM OR WHATEVER.

682
00:16:19,746 --> 00:16:20,747
IT'S, LIKE, A REALLY HARD

683
00:16:20,747 --> 00:16:21,814
DECISION.

684
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:23,283
I'M SURE YOU KNOW THAT.

685
00:16:23,283 --> 00:16:24,384
WELL, WAS THE FATHER THERE

686
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:25,152
FOR YOU?

687
00:16:25,152 --> 00:16:26,753
>> NO.

688
00:16:26,753 --> 00:16:27,920
[laughter]

689
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:28,755
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND,

690
00:16:28,755 --> 00:16:29,522
BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

691
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:30,223
GOING THROUGH IT.

692
00:16:30,223 --> 00:16:31,158
>> THEY'RE NOT THE ONE CARRYING.

693
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:32,259
NOT THAT I'M, LIKE, IN LOVE

694
00:16:32,259 --> 00:16:33,093
WITH HIM OR I LIKE HIM

695
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:34,061
OR WANT TO BE IN A RELATIONSHIP

696
00:16:34,061 --> 00:16:34,927
WITH HIM.

697
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,029
IT'S JUST, LIKE, IT'S HIS KID.

698
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:36,963
I KNOW HE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING

699
00:16:36,963 --> 00:16:38,398
FOR HER, BUT IT JUST

700
00:16:38,398 --> 00:16:39,932
KIND OF HURTS, YOU KNOW--

701
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,234
>> IT DOES HURT

702
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:42,402
THAT HE DOESN'T WANT IT.

703
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:44,003
LIKE, HOW CAN YOU NOT WANT

704
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,072
YOUR OWN KID?

705
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:46,539
GUYS, THEY JUST DON'T

706
00:16:46,539 --> 00:16:47,607
UNDERSTAND.

707
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:48,975
>> YEAH, THEY DON'T.

708
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:50,310
>> ARE YOU, LIKE, WORRIED

709
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:51,678
ABOUT ANYTHING?

710
00:16:51,678 --> 00:16:54,114
>> WELL, YEAH.

711
00:16:54,114 --> 00:16:55,148
I'M, LIKE, WORRIED

712
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:56,183
WHEN THE DAY COMES, I'M NOT

713
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:57,584
GOING TO BE ABLE TO DO IT.

714
00:16:57,584 --> 00:17:00,620
>> JUST THINK ABOUT YOURSELF.

715
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,822
IT'S THE ONLY ADVICE I HAVE.

716
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:04,557
I DON'T KNOW.

717
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:05,925
>> I WAS ABOUT TO LOOK

718
00:17:05,925 --> 00:17:06,993
AT MORE PROFILES

719
00:17:06,993 --> 00:17:08,061
WHEN MY MOM TOLD ME

720
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:09,162
SHE WANTED TO TALK TO ME

721
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:10,597
ABOUT MY AUNT AND UNCLE.

722
00:17:10,597 --> 00:17:11,698
>> LISA AND KENNY CALLED,

723
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,167
AND THEY WANTED ME TO ASK YOU

724
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:15,602
IF IT WAS OKAY IF THEY COULD

725
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:18,705
ADOPT YOUR BABY.

726
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:23,210
>> LIKE 100% ADOPT?

727
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:26,313
>> LIKE 100% LEGAL ADOPTION.

728
00:17:26,313 --> 00:17:28,281
IT'D BE THEIRS.

729
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:30,217
>> AND HE'S 100% ABOUT IT?

730
00:17:30,217 --> 00:17:32,552
>> 100%.

731
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:33,453
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

732
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:35,688
LIKE--I MEAN, IT'S A LOT BETTER

733
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:37,190
THAN HER GOING HOME WITH

734
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:41,394
STRANGERS, BUT I DON'T KNOW.

735
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:50,537
>> THE MORE I THINK ABOUT IT,

736
00:17:50,537 --> 00:17:52,004
THE MORE EXCITED I AM ABOUT

737
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:53,540
MY AUNT LISA AND UNCLE KENNY

738
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,941
ADOPTING THE BABY.

739
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:56,609
I TRIED TO CALL THE BABY'S DAD

740
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:57,910
TO SEE WHAT HE THOUGHT

741
00:17:57,910 --> 00:17:58,945
BUT FOUND THAT HIS PHONE

742
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:00,647
HAD BEEN DISCONNECTED.

743
00:18:00,647 --> 00:18:01,981
SO IT'S UP TO ME AND MY MOM

744
00:18:01,981 --> 00:18:02,749
TO FIGURE OUT

745
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,083
HOW THIS WILL ALL GO.

746
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:04,951
>> THEY'RE AT LISA'S.

747
00:18:04,951 --> 00:18:05,752
THEY'RE GOING TO CALL

748
00:18:05,752 --> 00:18:06,386
IN A MINUTE.

749
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:07,120
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT

750
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,054
WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO TELL THEM

751
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:08,821
AS FAR AS, LIKE,

752
00:18:08,821 --> 00:18:09,756
WHAT YOU'RE EXPECTING TO SEE

753
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:10,557
FROM THEM?

754
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:11,291
>> I DON'T KNOW.

755
00:18:11,291 --> 00:18:12,192
I JUST WANTED TO TALK TO THEM

756
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:13,025
AND JUST SEE, LIKE,

757
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:13,826
WHAT THEY THOUGHT.

758
00:18:13,826 --> 00:18:14,527
>> JUST PRETEND

759
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:15,195
THEY WERE STRANGERS

760
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:16,028
AND YOU'RE GOING TO TELL

761
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:17,063
THIS STRANGER, "I WANT

762
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:17,897
TO MAKE SURE I CAN SEE THEM

763
00:18:17,897 --> 00:18:18,798
ANNUALLY.

764
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:19,766
I WANT PICTURES AND LETTERS

765
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,601
MONTHLY, QUARTERLY, WEEKLY."

766
00:18:21,601 --> 00:18:22,502
>> IT'S MORE COMPLICATED

767
00:18:22,502 --> 00:18:23,770
WHEN YOU HAVE TO, LIKE, DEAL

768
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,472
WITH STRANGERS.

769
00:18:25,472 --> 00:18:27,006
>> IT'S LESS COMPLICATED

770
00:18:27,006 --> 00:18:27,874
WHEN YOU DEAL WITH STRANGERS,

771
00:18:27,874 --> 00:18:28,608
BECAUSE YOU TELL THEM

772
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:29,342
WHAT YOU WANT--

773
00:18:29,342 --> 00:18:30,143
>> NO, IT ISN'T, BECAUSE

774
00:18:30,143 --> 00:18:30,943
WITH LISA AND KENNY,

775
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:31,844
MOST LIKELY, THEY'LL BE

776
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:33,079
PUTTING PICTURES UP ONLINE.

777
00:18:33,079 --> 00:18:33,946
AND, LIKE, ON HOLIDAYS

778
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:34,781
AND STUFF, I'LL BE SEEING

779
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:35,448
THE BABY.

780
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:36,283
>> WELL, BUT YOU DON'T

781
00:18:36,283 --> 00:18:37,049
KNOW THAT.

782
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,419
LOOK, HERE'S LISA.

783
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:40,320
HI, LISA.

784
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,288
I'M GOING TO PUT YOU

785
00:18:41,288 --> 00:18:42,855
ON SPEAKERPHONE

786
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,257
SO YOU CAN TALK TO ASHLEY.

787
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:45,525
ONE SECOND.

788
00:18:45,525 --> 00:18:46,693
>> HEY.

789
00:18:46,693 --> 00:18:47,627
>> HI.

790
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:48,728
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN FEELING?

791
00:18:48,728 --> 00:18:50,563
>> GOOD, RELIEVED.

792
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,199
I FEEL, LIKE, REALLY GOOD

793
00:18:52,199 --> 00:18:53,466
ABOUT IT, AND I'M REALLY GLAD

794
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,734
Y'ALL ARE DOING THIS.

795
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:55,635
>> YOU KNOW I'VE WANTED

796
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,170
TO ADOPT ANYWAY, SO...

797
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:57,937
>> YEAH.

798
00:18:57,937 --> 00:18:59,005
>> WE'RE GETTING EVEN MORE

799
00:18:59,005 --> 00:18:59,939
EXCITED AS THE DAYS

800
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:00,773
ARE GOING ON.

801
00:19:00,773 --> 00:19:02,008
DO YOU HAVE ANY CONCERNS

802
00:19:02,008 --> 00:19:03,310
OR ANYTHING?

803
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:04,244
I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT,

804
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:05,278
YOU KNOW, WE KIND OF

805
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:06,078
TALK THROUGH EVERYTHING

806
00:19:06,078 --> 00:19:07,146
BEFORE WE DO GO AHEAD

807
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,415
AND GO THROUGH WITH IT.

808
00:19:08,415 --> 00:19:09,716
>> I WAS WONDERING, LIKE,

809
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:11,451
HOW YOU FELT ABOUT, LIKE,

810
00:19:11,451 --> 00:19:12,585
HOW IT'S GOING TO GO, LIKE,

811
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,221
WHEN I COME DOWN ON BREAK

812
00:19:14,221 --> 00:19:15,322
OR A HOLIDAY OR SOMETHING

813
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:16,155
TO VISIT.

814
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,023
>> THAT'S GOING TO BE FINE,

815
00:19:17,023 --> 00:19:17,757
BECAUSE YOU'RE PART

816
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:18,658
OF THE FAMILY.

817
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:19,992
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT,

818
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,261
YOU KNOW, KENNY AND I ARE

819
00:19:21,261 --> 00:19:23,196
RAISING HER AS OUR DAUGHTER,

820
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:24,096
AND IT SEEMS LIKE

821
00:19:24,096 --> 00:19:24,931
YOU DO KNOW THAT.

822
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:25,732
>> YEAH.

823
00:19:25,732 --> 00:19:27,734
LIKE, THAT'S HOW I THOUGHT TOO.

824
00:19:27,734 --> 00:19:30,337
>> BUT, SAY, FOUR YEARS DOWN

825
00:19:30,337 --> 00:19:31,604
THE ROAD, YOU'RE ABLE

826
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:33,139
TO SUPPORT A BABY.

827
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:34,474
WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

828
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:37,210
YOU REALIZE THAT YOU--

829
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:38,578
THERE'S REALLY NO GOING BACK

830
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:39,712
ON IT, RIGHT?

831
00:19:39,712 --> 00:19:40,447
>> OH, YEAH, YEAH.

832
00:19:40,447 --> 00:19:41,548
I UNDERSTAND.

833
00:19:41,548 --> 00:19:42,815
I JUST THINK IF I WAS GOING

834
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:44,083
TO DO ADOPTION ANYWAY,

835
00:19:44,083 --> 00:19:44,884
THIS IS, LIKE,

836
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:46,185
THE BEST WAY IT COULD GO.

837
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,186
>> IT'S GOING TO BE GREAT,

838
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,120
BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO GET

839
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,088
TO SEE HER GROW UP.

840
00:19:49,088 --> 00:19:50,357
YOU ALREADY KNOW US.

841
00:19:50,357 --> 00:19:52,825
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE GOOD.

842
00:19:52,825 --> 00:19:55,328
>> YEAH, IT WILL BE.

843
00:19:55,328 --> 00:19:56,796
>> ALL RIGHT, THEN.

844
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:58,030
>> OKAY.

845
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:58,798
>> BYE-BYE.

846
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:02,134
>> BYE.

847
00:20:02,134 --> 00:20:03,503
THAT WAS, LIKE, KIND OF FUNNY,

848
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:04,504
THOUGH, WHEN SHE WAS LIKE,

849
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:05,372
"WELL, YOU KNOW,

850
00:20:05,372 --> 00:20:06,639
THERE'S NO GOING BACK."

851
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:07,840
IT KIND OF, LIKE, MADE ME SAD

852
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,108
A LITTLE, BUT, I MEAN, I KNEW--

853
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:11,878
I KNOW THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

854
00:20:11,878 --> 00:20:13,246
>> THEY'RE RAISING HER.

855
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:16,249
THEY'RE HER PARENTS, AND--

856
00:20:16,249 --> 00:20:19,519
>> YEAH.

857
00:20:19,519 --> 00:20:20,887
>> YOU'LL GET TO SEE HER.

858
00:20:20,887 --> 00:20:23,690
>> YEAH.

859
00:20:26,259 --> 00:20:27,026
LIKE, I KNOW

860
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:29,262
IT'S THE BEST THING.

861
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:30,597
IT'S GOING TO BE HARD,

862
00:20:30,597 --> 00:20:31,731
BUT I'M STILL MOVING FORWARD

863
00:20:31,731 --> 00:20:33,666
WITH IT.

864
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,605
WE'RE HEADING DOWN TO HARLINGEN

865
00:20:38,605 --> 00:20:39,539
TO START WORKING OUT

866
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:40,907
AN ADOPTION PLAN.

867
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,542
MY AUNT AND UNCLE DECIDED

868
00:20:42,542 --> 00:20:43,710
THAT SINCE WE'RE A FAMILY,

869
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:45,177
WE COULD HANDLE THE ADOPTION

870
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:46,513
PRIVATELY WITH AN ATTORNEY

871
00:20:46,513 --> 00:20:49,449
AND NOT GO THROUGH THE AGENCY.

872
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:55,988
>> GO AHEAD, ASHLEY.

873
00:20:55,988 --> 00:20:57,023
YOU'RE HUNGRY.

874
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:57,857
>> THEY ALSO DECIDED

875
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:58,891
ON A NAME ALREADY,

876
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:00,293
CALLIE DANIELLE.

877
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:01,060
"DANIELLE" WILL BE

878
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,061
HER MIDDLE NAME BECAUSE IT'S

879
00:21:02,061 --> 00:21:04,163
MY AND MY AUNT'S MIDDLE NAME.

880
00:21:04,163 --> 00:21:05,565
>> AND SHE'S ALWAYS WANTED

881
00:21:05,565 --> 00:21:07,199
TO ADOPT, AND SO IT JUST SEEMED

882
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:08,935
LIKE THE PERFECT OPPORTUNITY.

883
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,169
>> AND WE'RE HELPING

884
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:11,338
THE ENTIRE FAMILY.

885
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:12,238
>> YEAH.

886
00:21:12,238 --> 00:21:14,140
WELL, THANK YOU FOR DOING THIS

887
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,141
AND STUFF.

888
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:16,409
IT'S RELIEVING.

889
00:21:16,409 --> 00:21:18,244
>> YEAH.

890
00:21:18,244 --> 00:21:19,512
I MEAN, AS MUCH AS WE'RE SURE

891
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:20,613
AND I FEEL LIKE

892
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,881
YOU'RE PRETTY SURE...

893
00:21:21,881 --> 00:21:22,615
>> I AM.

894
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,183
>> AND YOU'RE SET, YES.

895
00:21:24,183 --> 00:21:25,852
WHEN THE BABY IS BORN,

896
00:21:25,852 --> 00:21:27,620
THERE'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER--

897
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,721
THAT'S ANOTHER STEP

898
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:30,156
INTO IT'S MORE REAL.

899
00:21:30,156 --> 00:21:31,924
>> ANOTHER LEVEL OF REALITY.

900
00:21:31,924 --> 00:21:32,692
>> IT'S ANOTHER LEVEL

901
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:33,426
OF REALITY.

902
00:21:33,426 --> 00:21:34,727
AND WHEN YOU COME TO THE HOUSE,

903
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:35,828
HOW DO YOU THINK

904
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:36,763
YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL

905
00:21:36,763 --> 00:21:38,164
WHEN YOU SEE--

906
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:39,131
>> I DON'T KNOW.

907
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,266
I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

908
00:21:40,266 --> 00:21:41,133
I THOUGHT I WAS GOING TO, LIKE,

909
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,068
DEAL WITH THAT

910
00:21:42,068 --> 00:21:42,802
WHEN IT HAPPENED.

911
00:21:42,802 --> 00:21:43,803
>> IT'S HARD TO SAY.

912
00:21:43,803 --> 00:21:44,937
>> YEAH, THERE'S GOING TO BE

913
00:21:44,937 --> 00:21:46,606
A SPECIAL BOND THERE

914
00:21:46,606 --> 00:21:47,940
BETWEEN THE TWO OF YOU.

915
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,175
SHE'LL ALWAYS KNOW.

916
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:50,109
>> YEAH.

917
00:21:50,109 --> 00:21:51,110
I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'LL BE,

918
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:52,612
LIKE, CONFLICT OR ANYTHING.

919
00:21:52,612 --> 00:21:53,713
>> SO Y'ALL WANT TO BE CALLED

920
00:21:53,713 --> 00:21:55,214
AS SOON AS SHE GOES INTO LABOR?

921
00:21:55,214 --> 00:21:56,148
>> YEAH.

922
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,817
>> WE'RE DRIVING, YES.

923
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:58,618
>> DO Y'ALL WANT TO STAY

924
00:21:58,618 --> 00:21:59,251
WITH US?

925
00:21:59,251 --> 00:21:59,952
WOULD YOU RATHER STAY

926
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:00,753
WITH JENNA?

927
00:22:00,753 --> 00:22:01,888
OR WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN?

928
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:02,822
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

929
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:04,090
>> ME NEITHER.

930
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,224
I WAS, LIKE, CONFUSED.

931
00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:06,393
>> IS IT GOING TO BE EASIER

932
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:07,193
FOR YOU?

933
00:22:07,193 --> 00:22:08,260
>> WHATEVER'S EASIER FOR YOU.

934
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,629
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING

935
00:22:09,629 --> 00:22:10,797
TO FEEL, HONESTLY.

936
00:22:10,797 --> 00:22:11,731
>> A LOT OF THINGS, WE'RE JUST

937
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:12,465
GOING TO HAVE TO TAKE

938
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:13,433
AS IT COMES.

939
00:22:13,433 --> 00:22:15,968
>> YEAH.

940
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:17,069
THE BIGGEST QUESTION

941
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,337
FOR EVERYONE IS,

942
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:19,739
HOW ARE THINGS GOING TO WORK

943
00:22:19,739 --> 00:22:21,408
AFTER THE BABY IS BORN?

944
00:22:21,408 --> 00:22:22,575
IT'S TEXAS STATE LAW

945
00:22:22,575 --> 00:22:23,443
THAT THE BIRTH MOM

946
00:22:23,443 --> 00:22:25,412
GETS 48 HOURS WITH THE BABY.

947
00:22:25,412 --> 00:22:26,413
WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT

948
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:28,381
IS UP TO US.

949
00:22:31,751 --> 00:22:32,685
WITH MY DUE DATE FAST

950
00:22:32,685 --> 00:22:34,120
APPROACHING, I'M NOW SEEING

951
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,455
THE DOCTOR EVERY WEEK.

952
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:36,288
>> ASHLEY?

953
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,089
HI.

954
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:38,825
>> HI.

955
00:22:38,825 --> 00:22:40,226
>> WELL, ARE YOU GETTING

956
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:41,027
EXCITED?

957
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,294
>> SCARED.

958
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:43,696
>> THERE YOU GO.

959
00:22:43,696 --> 00:22:44,964
THE BABY'S MOVING A LOT

960
00:22:44,964 --> 00:22:45,698
FOR YOU?

961
00:22:45,698 --> 00:22:46,733
>> MM-HMM.

962
00:22:46,733 --> 00:22:48,501
[heartbeat whooshing]

963
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:49,736
>> GOT A STRONG HEARTBEAT.

964
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:51,337
>> THAT'S GOOD.

965
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:52,238
>> AS FAR AS

966
00:22:52,238 --> 00:22:53,072
IN THE DELIVERY ROOM,

967
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:54,206
YOUR MOM'S GOING TO BE

968
00:22:54,206 --> 00:22:54,907
IN THERE, RIGHT?

969
00:22:54,907 --> 00:22:55,742
>> YEAH.

970
00:22:55,742 --> 00:22:56,809
>> ANYBODY ELSE

971
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:57,977
THAT YOU WANT IN THERE?

972
00:22:57,977 --> 00:22:59,011
>> UM, I DON'T KNOW.

973
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:00,146
WE HAVEN'T REALLY DISCUSSED IT,

974
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:01,548
SO I'M NOT SURE.

975
00:23:01,548 --> 00:23:02,582
>> OKAY.

976
00:23:02,582 --> 00:23:03,382
IS THAT SOMETHING YOU WANT

977
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,083
TO TALK ABOUT NOW?

978
00:23:04,083 --> 00:23:04,784
OR IS THAT SOMETHING

979
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:05,518
YOU'RE GOING TO TALK

980
00:23:05,518 --> 00:23:06,318
WITH YOUR MOM ABOUT,

981
00:23:06,318 --> 00:23:07,119
WHAT YOU'D LIKE TO DO?

982
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:08,020
'CAUSE I KNOW IT'S GOING

983
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:08,555
TO BE HARDER

984
00:23:08,555 --> 00:23:09,221
THAN ANYTHING ELSE,

985
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:10,022
BUT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

986
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:10,923
THAT WE KNOW WHAT EXACTLY

987
00:23:10,923 --> 00:23:12,358
YOU WANT, OKAY?

988
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:13,159
WE'RE JUST GOING TO DO

989
00:23:13,159 --> 00:23:13,960
THIS LITTLE CERVICAL CHECK.

990
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:14,794
>> OKAY.

991
00:23:14,794 --> 00:23:15,762
>> LET YOUR LEGS FALL

992
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:16,763
WAY APART THERE.

993
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:17,497
JUST RELAX.

994
00:23:17,497 --> 00:23:18,431
>> BEING PREGNANT

995
00:23:18,431 --> 00:23:19,466
IS UNCOMFORTABLE ENOUGH

996
00:23:19,466 --> 00:23:20,399
WITHOUT HAVING TO THINK

997
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,534
ABOUT THESE THINGS.

998
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:22,635
BUT WITHOUT A SOCIAL WORKER

999
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:23,770
TO HELP US THROUGH,

1000
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,037
IT'S UP TO MY MOM TO GET

1001
00:23:25,037 --> 00:23:26,973
THE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS.

1002
00:23:26,973 --> 00:23:28,775
>> MY QUESTION TO YOU IS,

1003
00:23:28,775 --> 00:23:30,443
DO YOU WANT LISA AND KENNY

1004
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:33,179
IN THE DELIVERY ROOM?

1005
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:36,816
OKAY, SO TELL ME THIS.

1006
00:23:36,816 --> 00:23:38,951
WHEN SHE IS BORN AND THE DOCTOR

1007
00:23:38,951 --> 00:23:40,620
SAYS, "OH, HERE'S YOUR BABY,"

1008
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,754
DO YOU WANT HIM TO HAND HER

1009
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:42,822
TO LISA, OR DO YOU WANT HIM

1010
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:43,623
TO HAND HER TO YOU?

1011
00:23:43,623 --> 00:23:44,356
>> WHY WOULD HE HAND HER

1012
00:23:44,356 --> 00:23:45,224
TO LISA?

1013
00:23:45,224 --> 00:23:46,158
>> 'CAUSE SHE'S GOING TO BE

1014
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:46,993
THE MOM.

1015
00:23:46,993 --> 00:23:48,160
>> BUT IF SHE'S THERE,

1016
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:48,828
IT DOESN'T MEAN

1017
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:49,762
HE CAN'T HAND HER TO ME.

1018
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:50,497
>> OKAY, SO HE HANDS HER

1019
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:51,263
TO YOU.

1020
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,164
AND THEN WHEN SHE COMES

1021
00:23:52,164 --> 00:23:52,999
TO WANT TO HOLD THE BABY,

1022
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:53,933
DO YOU--ARE YOU GOING

1023
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,201
TO WANT HER TO HOLD HER?

1024
00:23:55,201 --> 00:23:56,135
OR WOULD YOU RATHER HAVE

1025
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:57,470
THAT TIME ALONE AND THEN JUST

1026
00:23:57,470 --> 00:23:58,404
BRING HER TO JENNA'S,

1027
00:23:58,404 --> 00:23:59,839
WHERE SHE WILL BE WAITING?

1028
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:00,807
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE WAITING

1029
00:24:00,807 --> 00:24:01,407
TO KNOW.

1030
00:24:01,407 --> 00:24:02,809
HOW IS THIS GOING TO HAPPEN?

1031
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:04,010
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1032
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,077
WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT?

1033
00:24:05,077 --> 00:24:05,878
>> WE CAN'T JUST GO

1034
00:24:05,878 --> 00:24:07,013
INTO THIS BLIND, BECAUSE

1035
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:08,314
SOMEONE'S GOING TO GET

1036
00:24:08,314 --> 00:24:10,817
THEIR FEELINGS HURT.

1037
00:24:10,817 --> 00:24:11,818
>> I DON'T LIKE TO MAKE

1038
00:24:11,818 --> 00:24:14,386
DECISIONS.

1039
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,457
I THOUGHT THE HARDEST PART

1040
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,626
WAS GOING TO BE CHOOSING

1041
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:20,727
ADOPTION.

1042
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:22,094
I HAD NO IDEA THERE WERE GOING

1043
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:23,496
TO BE SO MANY MORE DIFFICULT

1044
00:24:23,496 --> 00:24:26,265
DECISIONS ALONG THE WAY.

1045
00:24:33,172 --> 00:24:33,940
>> MY DOCTOR SAID HE COULD

1046
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,941
SAFELY INDUCE ME

1047
00:24:34,941 --> 00:24:36,509
A FEW DAYS EARLY SO I DON'T

1048
00:24:36,509 --> 00:24:38,410
GO INTO LABOR ON CHRISTMAS.

1049
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:39,546
THIS WAY, THE HOLIDAYS

1050
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:40,747
WON'T FOREVER BE CONNECTED

1051
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:42,414
TO THIS DECISION.

1052
00:24:42,414 --> 00:24:43,516
I WENT OVER TO MY AUNT JENNA'S

1053
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:45,718
HOUSE TO TELL HER THE NEWS.

1054
00:24:45,718 --> 00:24:46,986
I'M GLAD IT CAN FINALLY BE

1055
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:50,089
A PLANNED DATE, SO THAT'S GOOD.

1056
00:24:52,158 --> 00:24:53,660
>> OH, NO, BUT I PUT IT ONLINE,

1057
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,994
SO I THINK THEY KNOW.

1058
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,228
>> BUT IT'D PROBABLY BE BETTER

1059
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:57,429
COMING FROM YOU.

1060
00:24:57,429 --> 00:24:58,497
DO YOU THINK?

1061
00:24:58,497 --> 00:24:59,799
>> YEAH.

1062
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:02,535
[line ringing]

1063
00:25:02,535 --> 00:25:03,770
>> HELLO?

1064
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:04,604
>> LISA?

1065
00:25:04,604 --> 00:25:05,605
>> YES?

1066
00:25:05,605 --> 00:25:06,606
>> I WAS JUST GOING TO TELL YOU

1067
00:25:06,606 --> 00:25:08,808
THAT WE SET THE DATE TODAY.

1068
00:25:08,808 --> 00:25:09,776
>> THE 16TH.

1069
00:25:09,776 --> 00:25:10,643
>>YES, THE 16TH.

1070
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:12,612
SO I GUESS YOU KNOW.

1071
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:18,150
>> [laughs] NO.

1072
00:25:19,318 --> 00:25:20,019
>> OKAY.

1073
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:20,853
>> OKAY.

1074
00:25:20,853 --> 00:25:21,888
>> OKAY, BYE.

1075
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:24,056
>> BYE.

1076
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:27,226
>> IT'S GOING TO BE HARD,

1077
00:25:27,226 --> 00:25:29,328
'CAUSE IT'S, LIKE, "MY KID"

1078
00:25:29,328 --> 00:25:30,563
FOR NOW.

1079
00:25:30,563 --> 00:25:32,264
>> RIGHT.

1080
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:34,033
>> IN ADDITION TO PLANNING

1081
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:35,301
FOR THE ADOPTION, I NEED

1082
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:37,369
TO START PLANNING FOR COLLEGE.

1083
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:38,771
COLLEGE APPLICATIONS ARE DUE

1084
00:25:38,771 --> 00:25:39,939
SOON, AND I DON'T WANT

1085
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:41,774
TO FALL BEHIND, SO WE SCHEDULED

1086
00:25:41,774 --> 00:25:42,709
A MEETING WITH

1087
00:25:42,709 --> 00:25:44,110
THE COLLEGE ADVISOR.

1088
00:25:44,110 --> 00:25:45,111
>> HI, ASHLEY.

1089
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:45,778
RON FRANICK.

1090
00:25:45,778 --> 00:25:47,079
>> REALLY NICE TO MEET YOU.

1091
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,114
>> NICE TO MEET YOU.

1092
00:25:48,114 --> 00:25:48,815
COME ON IN.

1093
00:25:48,815 --> 00:25:49,582
COME ON IN.

1094
00:25:49,582 --> 00:25:50,549
I WAS HOPING THAT WE COULD TALK

1095
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,851
ABOUT WHERE YOU WANT TO GO,

1096
00:25:51,851 --> 00:25:52,619
WHAT YOU WANT TO STUDY.

1097
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:53,352
AND I KNOW

1098
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:54,153
THAT YOU'RE INTERESTED

1099
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:54,921
IN NEW YORK CITY SCHOOLS.

1100
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:55,655
WHAT ARE YOU INTERESTED

1101
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:56,422
IN STUDYING?

1102
00:25:56,422 --> 00:25:57,757
>> I THINK I'M INTO, LIKE,

1103
00:25:57,757 --> 00:25:58,958
PHOTOJOURNALISM OR SOMETHING

1104
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:00,359
A LOT MORE, LIKE, WRITING TOO.

1105
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:01,761
BUT I DON'T--LIKE, I DON'T KNOW

1106
00:26:01,761 --> 00:26:04,063
WHAT TYPE OF MAJOR.

1107
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,164
IT'S JUST, LIKE, A LOT

1108
00:26:05,164 --> 00:26:06,132
OF STUFF TO THINK ABOUT

1109
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:07,133
AND DECIDE.

1110
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:08,267
AND THEN BEING PREGNANT

1111
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:09,836
AND HAVING TO DEAL

1112
00:26:09,836 --> 00:26:11,170
WITH ALL THE COLLEGE DECISIONS,

1113
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,705
THERE'S SO MANY.

1114
00:26:12,705 --> 00:26:13,606
>> SHE'S OVERWHELMED

1115
00:26:13,606 --> 00:26:14,707
WITH ALL THE CHOICES

1116
00:26:14,707 --> 00:26:16,809
OF THE ADOPTION AND--

1117
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:18,911
>> MY AUNT AND UNCLE ARE GOING

1118
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,112
TO ADOPT THE BABY.

1119
00:26:20,112 --> 00:26:20,813
>> AT THE SAME TIME

1120
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:21,948
WITH COLLEGE AND CLASSES

1121
00:26:21,948 --> 00:26:22,982
AND TRYING TO DO HER BEST

1122
00:26:22,982 --> 00:26:24,250
ON HER S.A.T. AND--

1123
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:25,084
>> THAT'S A LOT.

1124
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:25,785
IT'S A LOT.

1125
00:26:25,785 --> 00:26:26,552
>> YEAH.

1126
00:26:26,552 --> 00:26:27,386
>> AND I ALSO THINK

1127
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:28,621
THAT VISITING SCHOOLS,

1128
00:26:28,621 --> 00:26:30,222
YOU HAVE AN INSTANT REACTION

1129
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:31,290
TO SAYING, "THIS IS A PLACE

1130
00:26:31,290 --> 00:26:32,558
THAT I COULD SEE MYSELF AT."

1131
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:34,093
>> YEAH, I WANT TO DO THAT.

1132
00:26:34,093 --> 00:26:35,795
>> THERE ARE SO MANY GOOD

1133
00:26:35,795 --> 00:26:36,996
SCHOOLS OUT THERE THAT CAN BE

1134
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:37,997
GREAT FITS, CERTAINLY

1135
00:26:37,997 --> 00:26:38,831
IN NEW YORK CITY.

1136
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:40,599
YOU HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT

1137
00:26:40,599 --> 00:26:41,500
CHOICES OUT THERE,

1138
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,671
WHICH IS KIND OF WONDERFUL.

1139
00:26:44,671 --> 00:26:45,404
IT WAS A REAL PLEASURE

1140
00:26:45,404 --> 00:26:46,138
TO TALK TO YOU TODAY.

1141
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:46,839
>> THANK YOU.

1142
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:47,539
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

1143
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:48,240
>> IT REALLY HELPED.

1144
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:49,208
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

1145
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:50,609
BYE, ASHLEY.

1146
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,878
>> TALKING TO THE COLLEGE

1147
00:26:51,878 --> 00:26:53,012
COUNSELOR WAS LIKE GETTING

1148
00:26:53,012 --> 00:26:54,814
A SNEAK PEEK AT MY FUTURE.

1149
00:26:54,814 --> 00:26:55,915
LIFE WITHOUT PARENTING

1150
00:26:55,915 --> 00:26:59,051
LOOKS PRETTY OKAY RIGHT NOW.

1151
00:26:59,051 --> 00:27:00,419
BUT I STILL HAVE TO GET THROUGH

1152
00:27:00,419 --> 00:27:01,821
THIS PREGNANCY.

1153
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:03,255
MY CURRENT PLAN IS TO HAVE

1154
00:27:03,255 --> 00:27:04,423
THE BABY, AND THEN MY MOM AND I

1155
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:05,291
WILL DRIVE HER DOWN

1156
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:06,292
TO MY AUNT LISA

1157
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:07,660
AND UNCLE KENNY'S HOUSE.

1158
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,828
SURE, IT'S A LONG DRIVE,

1159
00:27:08,828 --> 00:27:10,529
BUT THAT'S OKAY, SINCE IT'LL

1160
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:12,364
GIVE ME MORE TIME WITH THE BABY.

1161
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:13,265
BUT I'M NOT GETTING

1162
00:27:13,265 --> 00:27:15,601
MUCH SUPPORT ON THIS PLAN.

1163
00:27:15,601 --> 00:27:17,336
>> HARLINGEN'S A TEN-HOUR DRIVE.

1164
00:27:17,336 --> 00:27:18,270
>> WELL, I FIGURED

1165
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:19,438
YOU COULD DO IT IN PARTS.

1166
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:20,406
LIKE, TWO PARTS.

1167
00:27:20,406 --> 00:27:21,640
STOP AT CRACKER BARREL

1168
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:22,574
OR SOMETHING.

1169
00:27:22,574 --> 00:27:23,843
>> MY CONCERN IS,

1170
00:27:23,843 --> 00:27:25,177
THE MORE TIME THAT YOU SPEND

1171
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:27,013
WITH THE BABY, YOU'RE GOING

1172
00:27:27,013 --> 00:27:28,414
TO BOND.

1173
00:27:28,414 --> 00:27:29,749
>> WELL, NO ONE REALLY

1174
00:27:29,749 --> 00:27:30,750
UNDERSTANDS HOW I FEEL,

1175
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:31,650
BECAUSE NOBODY'S THE ONE

1176
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:32,451
THAT'S DOING IT.

1177
00:27:32,451 --> 00:27:33,152
>> NO, ASHLEY,

1178
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:34,186
BUT WE DO UNDERSTAND,

1179
00:27:34,186 --> 00:27:35,287
BECAUSE WE'VE HAD KIDS,

1180
00:27:35,287 --> 00:27:36,222
AND YOU'RE GOING TO BOND

1181
00:27:36,222 --> 00:27:37,189
WITH YOUR CHILD.

1182
00:27:37,189 --> 00:27:38,024
THE MORE TIME YOU HAVE

1183
00:27:38,024 --> 00:27:38,958
WITH HER, THE HARDER

1184
00:27:38,958 --> 00:27:40,927
IT'S GOING TO BE.

1185
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:42,895
>> [sighs]

1186
00:27:42,895 --> 00:27:44,797
FINE, NEW PLAN.

1187
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:46,465
EVERYONE WILL COME UP TO US.

1188
00:27:46,465 --> 00:27:47,700
AFTER I HAVE THE BABY,

1189
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:49,001
WE'LL SPEND THE 48 HOURS

1190
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,569
IN THE HOSPITAL AND THEN

1191
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:51,804
ALL MEET TO SIGN THE PAPERS

1192
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:52,671
WITH A NOTARY

1193
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:54,340
AT MY AUNT JENNA'S HOUSE.

1194
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,908
I CAN'T BELIEVE I STILL

1195
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:57,143
HAVE TO RESEARCH COLLEGES

1196
00:27:57,143 --> 00:27:58,244
AND KEEP STUDYING

1197
00:27:58,244 --> 00:27:59,712
FOR THE S.A.T.s BEFORE I GO

1198
00:27:59,712 --> 00:28:01,247
INTO LABOR.

1199
00:28:01,247 --> 00:28:02,614
MY INDUCEMENT

1200
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:04,050
IS ONLY DAYS AWAY NOW,

1201
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:05,117
AND I'VE NEVER BEEN

1202
00:28:05,117 --> 00:28:07,319
SO UNCOMFORTABLE IN MY LIFE.

1203
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,889
>> OKAY, PAGE 93.

1204
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:14,160
>> IT'S FINALLY TIME

1205
00:28:14,160 --> 00:28:15,361
TO HEAD TO THE HOSPITAL.

1206
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:16,595
BUT FIRST I WANT TO GIVE

1207
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:17,864
THE BABY'S DAD, JUSTIN,

1208
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:19,265
ONE LAST TRY.

1209
00:28:19,265 --> 00:28:20,132
I EMAILED HIM ABOUT

1210
00:28:20,132 --> 00:28:21,834
THE ADOPTION, AND ONCE HIS PHONE

1211
00:28:21,834 --> 00:28:23,569
GOT RECONNECTED, HE TEXTED ME

1212
00:28:23,569 --> 00:28:24,370
THAT HE WANTS TO BE THERE

1213
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:26,172
FOR THE BIRTH.

1214
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:27,006
beep!

1215
00:28:27,006 --> 00:28:28,374
UM, HEY, JUSTIN.

1216
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:29,141
I'VE BEEN CALLING,

1217
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:31,377
AND YOU HAVEN'T BEEN ANSWERING,

1218
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:32,879
SO I WAS JUST WONDERING

1219
00:28:32,879 --> 00:28:33,813
IF YOU WERE STILL GOING TO GO

1220
00:28:33,813 --> 00:28:36,849
TO THE HOSPITAL OR NOT.

1221
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:38,951
UM, JUST LET ME KNOW

1222
00:28:38,951 --> 00:28:40,052
AS SOON AS YOU CAN.

1223
00:28:40,052 --> 00:28:42,388
THANKS, BYE.

1224
00:28:42,388 --> 00:28:44,456
I REALLY HOPE HE GETS IN TOUCH,

1225
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:45,691
BECAUSE IT'S SCARY

1226
00:28:45,691 --> 00:28:48,694
TO BE GOING THROUGH THIS ALONE.

1227
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:50,029
I'M READY TO BE INDUCED

1228
00:28:50,029 --> 00:28:52,198
AND HAVE ALL OF THIS OVER WITH.

1229
00:28:52,198 --> 00:28:52,999
>> IS SHE DILATED AT ALL

1230
00:28:52,999 --> 00:28:53,699
RIGHT NOW?

1231
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:54,533
HAS HE CHECKED HER?

1232
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:55,534
>> NOT DILATED.

1233
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:57,837
>> NOTHING?

1234
00:28:57,837 --> 00:28:58,537
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK

1235
00:28:58,537 --> 00:28:59,671
ARE THE CHANCES I'D GO

1236
00:28:59,671 --> 00:29:00,873
INTO LABOR TONIGHT?

1237
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:01,841
>> EVERYBODY'S DIFFERENT.

1238
00:29:01,841 --> 00:29:03,575
PROBABLY IN THE MORNING.

1239
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,410
>> OH, MY GOSH.

1240
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:05,111
OKAY.

1241
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:06,012
>> IT'S OKAY.

1242
00:29:06,012 --> 00:29:06,913
>> I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW LONG

1243
00:29:06,913 --> 00:29:09,548
I'M GOING TO BE PUSHING FOR.

1244
00:29:14,153 --> 00:29:15,087
THE MINUTE I STARTED

1245
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,255
TO FEEL LABOR PAINS,

1246
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:17,423
THEY GAVE ME LOTS

1247
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:19,291
OF MEDICATION AND MY EPIDURAL.

1248
00:29:19,291 --> 00:29:21,627
>> HI.

1249
00:29:23,129 --> 00:29:24,897
>> MIMI, I LIKE YOUR SOCKS.

1250
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:26,298
THEY'RE ALL FANCY.

1251
00:29:26,298 --> 00:29:28,167
THEY GAVE ME SOME MEDICINE,

1252
00:29:28,167 --> 00:29:29,501
NUBAIN OR WHATEVER,

1253
00:29:29,501 --> 00:29:30,736
AND IT MAKES ME REALLY, JUST,

1254
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:31,537
LIKE--

1255
00:29:31,537 --> 00:29:32,438
>> SHE'S LOOPY.

1256
00:29:32,438 --> 00:29:33,139
>> WHAT WOULD YOU SAY

1257
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:34,406
YOUR PAIN IS NOW?

1258
00:29:34,406 --> 00:29:35,641
>> LIKE A 0.5 OR SOMETHING.

1259
00:29:35,641 --> 00:29:36,408
>> THAT'S WHAT WE WERE

1260
00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:37,209
AIMING FOR.

1261
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:38,144
>> AM I IN LABOR, LIKE,

1262
00:29:38,144 --> 00:29:38,811
RIGHT NOW?

1263
00:29:38,811 --> 00:29:39,812
>> YOU'RE IN LABOR.

1264
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:41,347
YOU JUST CAN'T FEEL ANYTHING.

1265
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:43,515
>> I'M GLAD I'M IN THE--FROM--

1266
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:45,084
THE FUTURE.

1267
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:46,252
NOT THE FUTURE BUT--

1268
00:29:46,252 --> 00:29:47,386
>> SHE'S GLAD

1269
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:49,155
SHE'S FROM THE FUTURE.

1270
00:29:49,155 --> 00:29:52,391
>> MIMI, YOU'RE SO CRAZY.

1271
00:29:59,832 --> 00:30:01,467
WHAT IS THIS FOR?

1272
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:03,135
>> THIS IS FOR IDENTIFICATION.

1273
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:04,670
YOU KNOW, IT MEANS THIS BABY

1274
00:30:04,670 --> 00:30:08,207
BELONGS TO THIS MOMMY.

1275
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,715
IT'LL BE FINE.

1276
00:30:16,715 --> 00:30:20,319
>> I'M SCARED.

1277
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:27,626
>> IT'S NOT TYPICAL TO GO

1278
00:30:27,626 --> 00:30:28,727
THROUGH SOMETHING THIS HARD

1279
00:30:28,727 --> 00:30:29,795
WITHOUT HELP.

1280
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:30,796
SO WHEN THE HOSPITAL REALIZED

1281
00:30:30,796 --> 00:30:31,663
WE DIDN'T HAVE

1282
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,032
AN ADOPTION AGENT,

1283
00:30:33,032 --> 00:30:35,201
THEY SENT UP A SOCIAL WORKER.

1284
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:36,268
>> HI.

1285
00:30:36,268 --> 00:30:37,069
>> UH-HUH.

1286
00:30:37,069 --> 00:30:38,104
>> HEY, ASHLEY, I'M JUDY.

1287
00:30:38,104 --> 00:30:39,005
I'M ONE OF THE SOCIAL WORKERS

1288
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:39,571
HERE.

1289
00:30:39,571 --> 00:30:40,272
>> HI.

1290
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:41,040
>> HI, HOW ARE YOU DOING?

1291
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:41,773
>> GOOD.

1292
00:30:41,773 --> 00:30:42,574
>> I WANTED TO COME BY

1293
00:30:42,574 --> 00:30:43,275
AND JUST TALK TO YOU

1294
00:30:43,275 --> 00:30:44,276
A LITTLE BIT, OKAY?

1295
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:45,044
JUST TELL ME A LITTLE BIT

1296
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:47,146
ABOUT YOU AND HOW YOU REACHED

1297
00:30:47,146 --> 00:30:48,915
THE DECISION FOR ADOPTION.

1298
00:30:48,915 --> 00:30:49,715
AND JUST KIND OF START

1299
00:30:49,715 --> 00:30:50,516
WITH THAT.

1300
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:51,884
>> WELL, I'M, LIKE, SO YOUNG,

1301
00:30:51,884 --> 00:30:54,353
AND I CAN'T--I'M NOT, LIKE,

1302
00:30:54,353 --> 00:30:56,055
CAPABLE OF TAKING CARE--

1303
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:56,923
LIKE, I CAN'T EVEN TAKE CARE

1304
00:30:56,923 --> 00:30:57,789
OF MYSELF.

1305
00:30:57,789 --> 00:31:00,026
AND I JUST WANT THE BABY

1306
00:31:00,026 --> 00:31:01,527
TO, LIKE, HAVE TWO PARENTS

1307
00:31:01,527 --> 00:31:03,395
AND A STABLE HOUSEHOLD.

1308
00:31:03,395 --> 00:31:04,897
>> AND YOUR PLANS ARE TO SPEND

1309
00:31:04,897 --> 00:31:05,664
SOME TIME WITH THE BABY.

1310
00:31:05,664 --> 00:31:06,398
IS THAT RIGHT?

1311
00:31:06,398 --> 00:31:07,333
>> YEAH, I WANT PRETTY MUCH

1312
00:31:07,333 --> 00:31:10,036
AS MUCH TIME AS I CAN HAVE.

1313

>> LIKE, HE WANTED TO,

1318
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:24,850
BUT JUST, LIKE, SOMETHING

1319
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:25,985
CAME UP, AND--

1320
00:31:25,985 --> 00:31:27,453
>> SO HE JUST COULDN'T MAKE IT?

1321
00:31:27,453 --> 00:31:30,722
>> MM-MM.

1322
00:31:30,722 --> 00:31:32,091
YEAH.

LIKE, AT LEAST I KNOW

1325
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:37,096

YOU'RE GOING TO TAKE

1340
00:31:57,316 --> 00:31:58,684
A DEEP BREATH AND HOLD IT

1341
00:31:58,684 --> 00:31:59,551

WE'RE GOING TO TRY

1345
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:03,789
TO GET THREE PUSHES

1346
00:32:03,789 --> 00:32:04,623

00:32:30,682 --> 00:32:31,850
[laughter]

1366
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:32,651
>> IT TAKES A LITTLE WHILE.

1367
00:32:32,651 --> 00:32:33,419
IT TAKES A LITTLE WHILE

1368
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:34,186
TO GET THE HANG OF IT.

1369
00:32:34,186 --> 00:32:35,287

DO YOU WANT HIM TO PUT HER UP

1397
00:33:10,656 --> 00:33:11,590
ON YOUR TUMMY, OR DO YOU

00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,424
WANT HIM TO TAKE HER

1399
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:13,292
RIGHT OVER TO THE WARMER

1405
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:19,331
TO HOLD HER.

1406
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:20,599

>> THEIR NAME AS THE MOTHER

1498
00:36:29,588 --> 00:36:30,689
AND THE FATHER.

1499
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:31,690
>> IS MY NAME GOING TO BE

1500
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:32,958
ON THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE?

1501
00:36:32,958 --> 00:36:33,825
>> YOUR NAME WILL BE

1502
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:34,760
ON THE BABY'S ORIGINAL

1503
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,694
BIRTH CERTIFICATE.

1504
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:36,495
YES, IT WILL BE.

1505
00:36:36,495 --> 00:36:37,396
>> SHE'S GOING TO HAVE TWO?

1506
00:36:37,396 --> 00:36:38,597
>> SHE WILL HAVE TWO

1507
00:36:38,597 --> 00:36:39,531
UNTIL SHE'S 18.

1508
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,267
THAT'S HOW IT NORMALLY HAPPENS

1509
00:36:41,267 --> 00:36:42,634
IN ADOPTIONS.

1510
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:44,169
I MEAN, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN

1511
00:36:44,169 --> 00:36:45,070
EXPLAINED ALREADY.

1512
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:46,305
I DON'T KNOW--

1513
00:36:46,305 --> 00:36:48,474
>> WELL, SINCE IT'S MY BROTHER

1514
00:36:48,474 --> 00:36:49,508
AND WE JUST REALLY HAVEN'T

1515
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:51,042
GONE INTO DETAILS--

1516
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,478
AND THAT'S THE THING, ASHLEY.

1517
00:36:52,478 --> 00:36:53,312
IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER,

1518
00:36:53,312 --> 00:36:54,480
SWEETHEART, BECAUSE

1519
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,282
SHE ALREADY KNOWS WHO YOU ARE.

1520
00:36:56,282 --> 00:36:58,484
>> YEAH.

1521
00:36:58,484 --> 00:37:01,086
>> THANK YOU.

1522
00:37:08,026 --> 00:37:09,127
YOU SURE?

1523
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:14,132
>> YEAH, NOT RIGHT NOW.

1524
00:37:14,132 --> 00:37:16,802
>>* WHEN WE CHANGE *

1525
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:19,538
* OUR MINDS *

1526
00:37:19,538 --> 00:37:23,775
* *

1527
00:37:31,817 --> 00:37:32,918
>> TOMORROW WHEN THEY

1528
00:37:32,918 --> 00:37:34,686
RELEASE YOU, I DON'T THINK

1529
00:37:34,686 --> 00:37:35,954
THEY'RE GOING TO KEEP YOU

1530
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:37,823
TILL 7:00.

1531
00:37:37,823 --> 00:37:38,990
I MEAN, IT'S LIKE YOU'RE KIND OF

1532
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:40,592
STUCK ON THIS 48-HOUR DEAL

1533
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:41,627
AND THAT'S IT.

1534
00:37:41,627 --> 00:37:42,828
>> YEAH.

1535
00:37:42,828 --> 00:37:44,663
>> I THINK BY NOON, THEY FEEL

1536
00:37:44,663 --> 00:37:46,698
THAT YOU'RE OKAY TO GO.

1537
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:48,099
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

1538
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,835
>> WHAT DON'T YOU KNOW?

1539
00:37:49,835 --> 00:37:50,969
>> I CAN'T MAKE A DECISION

1540
00:37:50,969 --> 00:37:52,037
THAT FAST.

1541
00:37:52,037 --> 00:37:52,838
>> ARE YOU STILL TRYING

1542
00:37:52,838 --> 00:37:54,873
TO MAKE A DECISION?

1543
00:38:06,518 --> 00:38:12,190
>> * SLEEP SOUND *

1544
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:18,029
* SLEEP SOUND *

1545
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:22,300
* SLEEP TO WAIT FOR CHANGE *

1546
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:27,939
>> IT'S BEEN 36 HOURS,

1547
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:29,741
AND I HAD NO IDEA THAT I'D DOUBT

1548
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:31,309
MY DECISION LIKE THIS.

1549
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:32,911
NOW IT'S 3:00 P.M., AND MY MOM

1550
00:38:32,911 --> 00:38:35,881
WANTS TO KNOW WHAT I WANT TO DO.

1551
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:38,450
>> TIME IS RUNNING OUT.

1552
00:38:38,450 --> 00:38:39,651
AND KENNY AND LISA

1553
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:40,486
ARE GOING TO BE OKAY

1554
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:41,853
WITH WHATEVER YOU DECIDE.

1555
00:38:41,853 --> 00:38:42,954
THEY'RE CONCERNED WITH YOU.

1556
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:44,556
>> WELL, I HAD DECIDED ALREADY

1557
00:38:44,556 --> 00:38:45,691
WHAT I WANTED TO DO.

1558
00:38:45,691 --> 00:38:46,758
I JUST DIDN'T THINK

1559
00:38:46,758 --> 00:38:48,460
THAT I WOULD, LIKE, RECONSIDER.

1560
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,361
>> WELL, HAVE YOU GONE THROUGH

1561
00:38:49,361 --> 00:38:50,295
THE LIST OF THE REASONS

1562
00:38:50,295 --> 00:38:51,697
WHY YOU DECIDED TO GIVE HER UP

1563
00:38:51,697 --> 00:38:52,564
FOR ADOPTION?

1564
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:53,632
>> YES, BUT FOR SOME REASON,

1565
00:38:53,632 --> 00:38:54,633
THEY JUST DON'T SEEM TO MATTER

1566
00:38:54,633 --> 00:38:56,735
ANYMORE.

1567
00:39:00,506 --> 00:39:01,139
>> I DID.

1568
00:39:01,139 --> 00:39:02,207
I HAD YOU YOUNG,

1569
00:39:02,207 --> 00:39:03,141
AND I HAD TO GROW UP,

1570
00:39:03,141 --> 00:39:04,510
AND I WASN'T A STAY-AT-HOME MOM,

1571
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:05,343
AND I DIDN'T GET TO GO

1572
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:07,746
TO YOUR SCHOOL FUNCTIONS, AND--

1573
00:39:07,746 --> 00:39:09,515
THOSE ARE ALL THE REASONS

1574
00:39:09,515 --> 00:39:10,281
THAT YOU DIDN'T WANT

1575
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:11,349
ON YOUR LIST.

1576
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:12,518
>> I JUST WISH

1577
00:39:12,518 --> 00:39:15,654
THAT I COULD DO IT.

1578
00:39:15,654 --> 00:39:16,622
>> I'LL SUPPORT

1579
00:39:16,622 --> 00:39:19,057
WHATEVER YOU DECIDE.

1580
00:39:19,057 --> 00:39:20,392
BUT I HOPE YOU'RE DOING IT

1581
00:39:20,392 --> 00:39:24,696
FOR HER.

1582
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:29,300
'CAUSE IF YOU DO IT FOR YOU,

1583
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,335
I DON'T THINK

1584
00:39:30,335 --> 00:39:33,038
THAT'S THE RIGHT DECISION.

1585
00:39:33,038 --> 00:39:34,540
I WANT TO HOLD HER.

1586
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,774
I JUST WANT TO SNUGGLE HER

1587
00:39:35,774 --> 00:39:37,609
FOR A MINUTE.

1588
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:39,978
I LOVE HER TOO.

1589
00:39:51,289 --> 00:39:52,858
IF I LET MY EMOTIONS MAKE

1590
00:39:52,858 --> 00:39:53,792
THE DECISION,

1591
00:39:53,792 --> 00:39:56,194
I WOULD KEEP HER TOO.

1592
00:39:56,194 --> 00:39:57,362
>> IT'S GOING TO BE HARD

1593
00:39:57,362 --> 00:40:00,131
TO SIGN THE PAPERS.

1594
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:01,567
>> ARE YOU DECIDING, THEN,

1595
00:40:01,567 --> 00:40:02,468
YOU THINK YOU'RE GOING

1596
00:40:02,468 --> 00:40:04,269
TO GO THROUGH WITH IT?

1597
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:05,203
>> YEAH.

1598
00:40:05,203 --> 00:40:06,572
I CAN'T REALLY THINK ABOUT--

1599
00:40:06,572 --> 00:40:09,140
I CAN'T THINK ABOUT MYSELF.

1600
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:14,980
>> *I WAS MADE TO FLY *

1601
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:18,416

* I WAS... *

1609
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:06,364
>> WE ASKED A NOTARY TO MEET US

1610
00:41:06,364 --> 00:41:07,699
AT MY AUNT JENNA'S HOUSE,

1611
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:08,600
WHERE KENNY AND LISA

1612
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:09,701
HAVE BEEN WAITING.

1613
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:10,401
>> HI.

1614
00:41:10,401 --> 00:41:11,069
>> HI.

1615
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:11,803
>> COME ON IN.

1616
00:41:11,803 --> 00:41:12,971
>> I'M TAMIKO. I'M A NOTARY.

1617
00:41:12,971 --> 00:41:13,705
>> LISA.

1618
00:41:13,705 --> 00:41:14,439
>> NICE TO MEET YOU.

1619
00:41:14,439 --> 00:41:15,440
>> NICE TO MEET YOU.

1620
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,642
>> YOU NEED TO FILL IN

1621
00:41:16,642 --> 00:41:17,509
THE PERTINENT INFORMATION,

1622
00:41:17,509 --> 00:41:18,777
'CAUSE I'M JUST THE NOTARY HERE.

1623
00:41:18,777 --> 00:41:20,378
SO I'M NOT GOING TO READ OVER

1624
00:41:20,378 --> 00:41:21,212
THE DOCUMENT.

1625
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:22,380
I'M ONLY WITNESSING YOUR

1626
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:25,450
SIGNATURE AND NOTARIZING, OKAY?

1627
00:41:41,733 --> 00:41:45,470

FEELING LIKE I HAD MADE

1641
00:42:42,027 --> 00:42:48,533
THE WRONG DECISION.

1642
00:42:48,533 --> 00:42:50,301
OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS,

1643
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:53,204
IT DIDN'T GET ANY EASIER.

1644
00:42:53,204 --> 00:42:55,006
I'M IGNORING ALL MY FRIENDS,

1645
00:42:55,006 --> 00:42:56,274
I HAVEN'T HEARD A WORD

1646
00:42:56,274 --> 00:42:58,043
FROM JUSTIN, AND I'VE NEVER FELT

1647
00:42:58,043 --> 00:43:03,649
SO MISERABLE.

1648
00:43:03,649 --> 00:43:06,584
>> IT'S OKAY TO BE UPSET.

1649
00:43:13,291 --> 00:43:14,092
>> I THINK IT'S GOING

1650
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:14,960
TO GET EASIER EVERY DAY.

1651
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:15,861
>> AND WHAT IF IT DOESN'T?

1652
00:43:15,861 --> 00:43:16,628
WHAT IF I'M LIKE THIS

1653
00:43:16,628 --> 00:43:18,296
EVERY SINGLE DAY?

1654
00:43:18,296 --> 00:43:19,364
>> YOU HONESTLY THINK

1655
00:43:19,364 --> 00:43:20,799
YOU MADE THE WRONG CHOICE?

1656
00:43:20,799 --> 00:43:23,301
>> YES.

1657
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:26,104
I WOULD SERIOUSLY DRIVE

1658
00:43:26,104 --> 00:43:30,842
DOWN THERE RIGHT NOW.

1659
00:43:30,842 --> 00:43:32,043
I THINK I MADE

1660
00:43:32,043 --> 00:43:33,444
THE WRONG DECISION.

1661
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,846
I STILL BELIEVE IN ADOPTION.

1662
00:43:34,846 --> 00:43:35,981
I JUST FEEL LIKE MAYBE

1663
00:43:35,981 --> 00:43:37,248
IN MY SITUATION,

1664
00:43:37,248 --> 00:43:39,818
I COULD HAVE KEPT HER.

1665
00:43:39,818 --> 00:43:41,219
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS RIGHT

1666
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:42,320
OR WRONG RIGHT NOW.

1667
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,254
I DON'T KNOW.

1668
00:43:43,254 --> 00:43:44,322
I DON'T KNOW.

1669
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:45,891
I MISS HER.

1670
00:43:45,891 --> 00:43:47,125
I COULDN'T TAKE IT.

1671
00:43:47,125 --> 00:43:48,126
I BOUGHT A PLANE TICKET

1672
00:43:48,126 --> 00:43:49,327
AND CALLED KENNY AND LISA

1673
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:50,328
TO TELL THEM I WAS COMING

1674
00:43:50,328 --> 00:43:51,629
TO GET MY DAUGHTER.

1675
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:52,630
BY THE TIME I GOT THERE,

1676
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:53,631
THEY'D HAD SOME TIME

1677
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,632
TO GET USED TO THE IDEA,

1678
00:43:54,632 --> 00:43:55,633
AND THEY WERE SUPPORTIVE

1679
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:58,303
OF ME TRYING TO PARENT.

1680

00:49:52,923 --> 00:49:54,325
>> HEY, BABY, WHEREVER

1865
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:55,626
YOU'RE THROWING HER PAMPERS OUT,

1866
00:49:55,626 --> 00:49:56,827
YOU NEED TO EMPTY THE TRASH

1867
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,163
OFTEN.

1868
00:49:58,163 --> 00:49:59,164
YOU CAN'T JUST LET IT SIT

1869
00:49:59,164 --> 00:50:02,600
AND FILL UP.

1870
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:03,634
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ANY MORE

1871
00:50:03,634 --> 00:50:05,170
ABOUT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO?

1872
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:06,071
>> WELL, I DON'T WANT

1873
00:50:06,071 --> 00:50:07,738
TO GIVE HER BACK.

1874
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:08,839
>> YOU NEED TO WORK

1875
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:09,840
THIS SEMESTER IF YOU'RE NOT

1876
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,775
GOING TO BE IN SCHOOL.

1877
00:50:10,775 --> 00:50:11,509
>> I KNOW THAT.

1878
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:12,510
I'M JUST SCARED TO LEAVE HER

1879
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:15,980
WITH ANYBODY.

1880
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:17,482
I JUST DON'T FEEL SAFE,

1881
00:50:17,482 --> 00:50:21,419
LEAVING HER WITH ANYONE ELSE.

1882
00:50:21,419 --> 00:50:24,455
>> CAN I HOLD HER?

1883
00:50:26,124 --> 00:50:29,227
HEY, LITTLE STINKER.

1884
00:50:29,227 --> 00:50:30,695
WHAT YOU'RE FEELING IS NORMAL,

1885
00:50:30,695 --> 00:50:31,729
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIND

1886
00:50:31,729 --> 00:50:33,098
A WAY TO BE OKAY WITH IT.

1887
00:50:33,098 --> 00:50:33,931
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1888
00:50:33,931 --> 00:50:34,865
LIKE, MAYBE THIS IS

1889
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:35,633
THE WRONG CHOICE

1890
00:50:35,633 --> 00:50:36,667
IF SHE'S GOING TO BE

1891
00:50:36,667 --> 00:50:38,703
IN DAYCARE ALL THE TIME.

1892
00:50:38,703 --> 00:50:39,770
>> AND THEN IF YOU DON'T

1893
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:40,871
WANT THAT FOR HER,

1894
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:41,639
THEN AT SOME POINT,

1895
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:42,540
YOU HAVE TO DECIDE

1896
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:43,408
WHETHER OR NOT SHE'S GOING

1897
00:50:43,408 --> 00:50:44,142
TO KENNY AND LISA'S.

1898
00:50:44,142 --> 00:50:45,009
>> WELL, I DON'T WANT TO--

1899
00:50:45,009 --> 00:50:46,944
LIKE, I CAN'T BE WITHOUT HER.

1900
00:50:46,944 --> 00:50:47,845
>> YOU DON'T THINK YOU'LL

1901
00:50:47,845 --> 00:50:48,679
BE ABLE TO JUST FUNCTION

1902
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:49,814
AND GO ON WITH LIFE ONCE YOU

1903
00:50:49,814 --> 00:50:51,549
GET BUSY IN COLLEGE AND--

1904
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:53,351
>> EITHER WAY, YOU DON'T KNOW.

1905
00:50:53,351 --> 00:50:54,785
AND EITHER WAY, IT FEELS LIKE

1906
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:57,655
IT'S STILL SCARY.

1907
00:51:08,566 --> 00:51:09,767
>> KENNY AND LISA SHIPPED UP

1908
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:10,701
ENOUGH BABY SUPPLIES

1909
00:51:10,701 --> 00:51:11,636
TO GET US THROUGH

1910
00:51:11,636 --> 00:51:12,703
THE FIRST FEW WEEKS.

1911
00:51:12,703 --> 00:51:13,704
AND EVEN THOUGH IT'S A TRIAL

1912
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:15,005
PERIOD, I STILL WANTED

1913
00:51:15,005 --> 00:51:16,307
TO GET CALLIE A REAL CRIB

1914
00:51:16,307 --> 00:51:17,875
TO SLEEP IN.

1915
00:51:17,875 --> 00:51:19,577
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU NEED?

1916
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:20,845
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1917
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:22,247
>> LOOK HOW PRETTY THAT IS.

1918
00:51:22,247 --> 00:51:23,448
>> THAT IS.

1919
00:51:23,448 --> 00:51:26,584
>> IT'S $580 FOR ALL OF THAT?

1920
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:28,286
>> I THINK THAT'S $1,000.

1921
00:51:28,286 --> 00:51:29,954
>> LOOK AT THAT CHAIR.

1922
00:51:29,954 --> 00:51:31,956
>> OH, I THOUGHT IT SAID $19.99.

1923
00:51:31,956 --> 00:51:33,524
$139.99.

1924
00:51:33,524 --> 00:51:34,359
>> IT'S MORE

1925
00:51:34,359 --> 00:51:35,460
THAN THE HIGH CHAIR.

1926
00:51:35,460 --> 00:51:36,627
>> THAT'S REALLY PRETTY, THOUGH.

1927
00:51:36,627 --> 00:51:39,230
>> I THINK WE SHOULD WAIT,

1928
00:51:39,230 --> 00:51:40,431
AT LEAST A COUPLE OF WEEKS,

1929
00:51:40,431 --> 00:51:41,399
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW

1930
00:51:41,399 --> 00:51:42,433
IF YOUR DECISION'S MADE.

1931
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:43,134
I DON'T KNOW

1932
00:51:43,134 --> 00:51:44,034
IF YOU'VE THOUGHT ABOUT IT.

1933
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:44,869
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE

1934
00:51:44,869 --> 00:51:45,770
AVOIDING IT.

1935
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:46,471
I DON'T KNOW,

1936
00:51:46,471 --> 00:51:47,405
BUT WE SHOULD WAIT.

1937
00:51:47,405 --> 00:51:49,174
AT SOME POINT--I'M NOT

1938
00:51:49,174 --> 00:51:50,208
RUSHING YOU AT ALL...

1939
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:51,008
>> I KNOW.

1940
00:51:51,008 --> 00:51:51,842
>> I NEED AN ANSWER,

1941
00:51:51,842 --> 00:51:52,943
BECAUSE SHE CAN'T SLEEP

1942
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,412
IN A PLAYPEN FOREVER.

1943
00:51:54,412 --> 00:51:55,846
>> I KNOW.

1944
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:58,349
>> OKAY.

1945
00:52:07,024 --> 00:52:09,627
[Callie crying]

1946
00:52:13,231 --> 00:52:14,499
PART OF HAVING CALLIE HERE

1947
00:52:14,499 --> 00:52:15,600
MEANS THAT I HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE

1948
00:52:15,600 --> 00:52:16,801
FINANCIALLY.

1949
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:17,635
I KEPT UP MY END

1950
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:18,603
OF THE BARGAIN AND AGREED

1951
00:52:18,603 --> 00:52:19,870
TO LOOK FOR PART-TIME WORK,

1952
00:52:19,870 --> 00:52:20,971
BUT THE LONGER I GO

1953
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,139
WITHOUT A DECISION,

1954
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,308
THE MORE TENSE THINGS GET

1955
00:52:23,308 --> 00:52:24,542
IN THE HOUSE.

1956
00:52:24,542 --> 00:52:25,710
MY MOM AND I NEVER WORKED OUT

1957
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:26,477
WHO WOULD HAVE

1958
00:52:26,477 --> 00:52:27,945
WHAT RESPONSIBILITIES.

1959
00:52:27,945 --> 00:52:29,046
>> THIS BOX HAS BEEN SITTING

1960
00:52:29,046 --> 00:52:30,948
IN HER ROOM, COLLECTING TRASH.

1961
00:52:30,948 --> 00:52:32,317
THAT'S THE BAG OF DIAPERS

1962
00:52:32,317 --> 00:52:34,819
THAT SIT ON HER DOOR.

1963
00:52:38,256 --> 00:52:39,290
I THINK WRITING DOWN

1964
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:41,292
WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR WHAT

1965
00:52:41,292 --> 00:52:42,660
SO THAT WHY, THERE'S NOT

1966
00:52:42,660 --> 00:52:43,628
ANY MORE CONFUSION.

1967
00:52:43,628 --> 00:52:45,095
I INITIALLY TOLD YOU

1968
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:46,431
I WOULD HELP YOU WITH,

1969
00:52:46,431 --> 00:52:47,565
YOU KNOW, FINANCIAL,

1970
00:52:47,565 --> 00:52:50,201
BUT I ENVISION YOU USING

1971
00:52:50,201 --> 00:52:52,703
YOUR MONEY TO SUPPORT CALLIE

1972
00:52:52,703 --> 00:52:54,138
AS MUCH AS YOU CAN,

1973
00:52:54,138 --> 00:52:55,773
AND THEN WHATEVER YOU CAN'T,

1974
00:52:55,773 --> 00:52:57,375
I'LL MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE.

1975
00:52:57,375 --> 00:52:58,309
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW

1976
00:52:58,309 --> 00:52:59,076
HOW MANY HOURS

1977
00:52:59,076 --> 00:52:59,944
YOU'RE GOING TO WORK.

1978
00:52:59,944 --> 00:53:01,346
>> WELL, JUST DO 15,

1979
00:53:01,346 --> 00:53:02,613
'CAUSE THAT'S MINIMUM PART-TIME,

1980
00:53:02,613 --> 00:53:03,748
PRETTY MUCH.

1981
00:53:03,748 --> 00:53:06,917
AND IF I MAKE $7.90,

1982
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:08,653
WHICH ISN'T A LOT,

1983
00:53:08,653 --> 00:53:09,820
THAT'S, LIKE, MY WHOLE PAYCHECK.

1984
00:53:09,820 --> 00:53:10,821
>> WELL, SHE'S YOUR DAUGHTER,

1985
00:53:10,821 --> 00:53:11,622
RIGHT.

1986
00:53:11,622 --> 00:53:12,823
MY WHOLE PAYCHECK GOES TO Y'ALL.

1987
00:53:12,823 --> 00:53:13,724
>> WELL, WRITE IT DOWN THEN,

1988
00:53:13,724 --> 00:53:15,993
I GUESS.

1989
00:53:15,993 --> 00:53:17,328
>> I CANNOT MAKE A COMMITMENT

1990
00:53:17,328 --> 00:53:18,496
TO BABYSIT IN THE EVENING,

1991
00:53:18,496 --> 00:53:19,664
BECAUSE I NEVER KNOW WHEN

1992
00:53:19,664 --> 00:53:20,598
MY EVENING EVENTS

1993
00:53:20,598 --> 00:53:21,499
ARE GOING TO BE.

1994
00:53:21,499 --> 00:53:23,568
BUT IF I'M AVAILABLE

1995
00:53:23,568 --> 00:53:25,936
AND I'M HOME, I WILL HELP YOU.

1996
00:53:25,936 --> 00:53:27,872
I'M NOT GETTING UP AT NIGHT.

1997
00:53:27,872 --> 00:53:29,039
>> OKAY.

1998
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:29,874
>> OKAY, I'M WILLING

1999
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:31,742
TO BABYSIT, I GUESS,

2000
00:53:31,742 --> 00:53:33,244
ONE WEEKEND A MONTH

2001
00:53:33,244 --> 00:53:34,245
IF YOU WANT TO GO OUT

2002
00:53:34,245 --> 00:53:35,280
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

2003
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,247
>> A MONTH?

2004
00:53:36,247 --> 00:53:40,518
>> YEAH, I MEAN--

2005
00:53:40,518 --> 00:53:41,719
WHAT ELSE ARE YOU THINKING

2006
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:43,321
THAT YOU WANT ME TO DO?

2007
00:53:43,321 --> 00:53:45,590
>> NOTHING...ANYMORE.

2008
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:46,657
>> 'CAUSE I HAVE A WHOLE LIST

2009
00:53:46,657 --> 00:53:47,892
OF THINGS FOR YOU TO DO AT HOME.

2010
00:53:47,892 --> 00:53:48,793
>> OKAY.

2011
00:53:48,793 --> 00:53:49,594
>> IF SHE'S GOING TO STAY,

2012
00:53:49,594 --> 00:53:50,428
I DON'T WANT HER DIAPERS

2013
00:53:50,428 --> 00:53:51,329
TO PILE UP LIKE THEY DO

2014
00:53:51,329 --> 00:53:52,330
RIGHT NOW.

2015
00:53:52,330 --> 00:53:54,064
>> THE TRASH CAN IS ALWAYS FULL.

2016
00:53:54,064 --> 00:53:56,066
>> OKAY, THEN TAKE OUT

2017
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:57,402
THE TRASH.

2018
00:53:57,402 --> 00:53:58,903
>> OKAY.

2019
00:53:58,903 --> 00:54:00,405
OH, MY GOD.

2020
00:54:00,405 --> 00:54:01,739
>> OKAY, I DON'T WANT

2021
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:02,607
TO DO THIS.

2022
00:54:02,607 --> 00:54:03,841
>> WHAT?

2023
00:54:03,841 --> 00:54:05,042
>> YOU'RE JUST IMPOSSIBLE

2024
00:54:05,042 --> 00:54:06,344
TO TALK TO.

2025
00:54:06,344 --> 00:54:07,144
YOU CAN FIGURE IT OUT

2026
00:54:07,144 --> 00:54:09,213
ON YOUR OWN.

2027
00:54:09,213 --> 00:54:10,247
>> CAN WE PLEASE JUST--

2028
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,048
>> NO, ASHLEY,

2029
00:54:11,048 --> 00:54:11,782
I WANT YOU TO GROW UP.

2030
00:54:11,782 --> 00:54:12,717
I'VE ALREADY RAISED MY KIDS,

2031
00:54:12,717 --> 00:54:13,851
AND I DON'T WANT TO GO AROUND

2032
00:54:13,851 --> 00:54:15,286
TELLING YOU HOW TO RAISE YOURS.

2033
00:54:15,286 --> 00:54:20,157
I WANT YOU TO DO IT.

2034
00:54:20,157 --> 00:54:21,659
>> THIS IS NOT HOW I THOUGHT

2035
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:24,595
HAVING CALLIE WOULD BE.

2036
00:54:31,135 --> 00:54:32,337
IN MY HEART, I'M FEELING

2037
00:54:32,337 --> 00:54:33,704
THAT PARENTING ISN'T RIGHT.

2038
00:54:33,704 --> 00:54:35,540
BUT IT STILL FEELS IMPOSSIBLE

2039
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:37,007
TO BE WITHOUT CALLIE.

2040
00:54:37,007 --> 00:54:38,543
>> SHE'S SO CUTE.

2041
00:54:38,543 --> 00:54:40,077
I'M SURPRISED YOU GOT CALLIE.

2042
00:54:40,077 --> 00:54:40,945
>> I DIDN'T WANT TO, LIKE,

2043
00:54:40,945 --> 00:54:42,246
NOT TRY.

2044
00:54:42,246 --> 00:54:43,147
I'VE HAD HER

2045
00:54:43,147 --> 00:54:44,449
FOR ABOUT A MONTH NOW.

2046
00:54:44,449 --> 00:54:45,383
IT'S A LOT HARDER THAN

2047
00:54:45,383 --> 00:54:46,417
I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE.

2048
00:54:46,417 --> 00:54:47,452
IT'S NOT JUST, LIKE,

2049
00:54:47,452 --> 00:54:48,386
CHANGING DIAPERS

2050
00:54:48,386 --> 00:54:49,454
AND FEEDING HER.

2051
00:54:49,454 --> 00:54:50,388
I ALWAYS HAVE TO, LIKE, WORRY

2052
00:54:50,388 --> 00:54:52,056
ABOUT HER FUTURE AND STUFF.

2053
00:54:52,056 --> 00:54:53,491
>> I BET.

2054
00:54:53,491 --> 00:54:56,394
>> YEAH.

2055
00:54:56,394 --> 00:54:57,695
WHEN I SAW CALLIE

2056
00:54:57,695 --> 00:54:58,863
IN THE HOSPITAL, ALL OF

2057
00:54:58,863 --> 00:54:59,864
MY ORIGINAL REASONS

2058
00:54:59,864 --> 00:55:01,098
FOR CHOOSING ADOPTION

2059
00:55:01,098 --> 00:55:02,066
WENT OUT THE DOOR.

2060
00:55:02,066 --> 00:55:03,401
I WAS TRYING TO CHOOSE

2061
00:55:03,401 --> 00:55:05,002
A BETTER FUTURE FOR BOTH OF US:

2062
00:55:05,002 --> 00:55:06,036
COLLEGE FOR ME

2063
00:55:06,036 --> 00:55:08,072
AND A STABLE HOME FOR HER.

2064
00:55:08,072 --> 00:55:09,674
IN MY GUT, I STILL FEEL

2065
00:55:09,674 --> 00:55:10,741
LIKE I WAS RIGHT,

2066
00:55:10,741 --> 00:55:12,042
BUT I JUST WASN'T PREPARED

2067
00:55:12,042 --> 00:55:14,011
FOR THE GRIEVING PROCESS.

2068
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:15,646
THERE IS NO WAY I CAN MAKE

2069
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:17,448
A FINAL DECISION WITHOUT HELP,

2070
00:55:17,448 --> 00:55:18,749
SO MY MOM SUGGESTED

2071
00:55:18,749 --> 00:55:19,917
WE ASK ASHLEY

2072
00:55:19,917 --> 00:55:21,386
FROM THE ADOPTION AGENCY

2073
00:55:21,386 --> 00:55:22,219
TO COME BACK.

2074
00:55:22,219 --> 00:55:23,754
>> HI, LISA, HOW ARE YOU?

2075
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:24,489
>> GOOD.

2076
00:55:24,489 --> 00:55:25,390
>> ASHLEY'S HAVING A HARD TIME

2077
00:55:25,390 --> 00:55:27,124
MAKING A DECISION.

2078
00:55:27,124 --> 00:55:28,393
AND JUST KIND OF FEEL LIKE

2079
00:55:28,393 --> 00:55:29,460
SHE REALLY, REALLY WANTS

2080
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:30,795
TO PROCEED WITH THE ADOPTION,

2081
00:55:30,795 --> 00:55:32,563
BUT SHE JUST CAN'T, YOU KNOW,

2082
00:55:32,563 --> 00:55:35,032
COME TO TERMS WITH IT.

2083
00:55:36,967 --> 00:55:37,835
>> I KNOW.

2084
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:40,104
WE HAVE DECIDED TO BRING ASHLEY

2085
00:55:40,104 --> 00:55:41,238
FROM GLADNEY BACK

2086
00:55:41,238 --> 00:55:42,206
INTO THE PICTURE, BECAUSE

2087
00:55:42,206 --> 00:55:43,007
SHE'S THE ONLY ONE

2088
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:43,908
THAT SHE'S REALLY EVER

2089
00:55:43,908 --> 00:55:44,642
CONNECTED WITH.

2090
00:55:44,642 --> 00:55:46,444
AND I THINK THIS IS PROBABLY

2091
00:55:46,444 --> 00:55:47,578
GOING TO HELP HER FIND PEACE

2092
00:55:47,578 --> 00:55:48,613
IN THE DECISION,

2093
00:55:48,613 --> 00:55:51,516
WHICHEVER WAY SHE DECIDES TO GO.

2094
00:55:51,516 --> 00:55:54,184
>> YEAH.

2095
00:55:54,184 --> 00:55:57,488
>> both: HI.

2096
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:00,958
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK

2097
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:02,326
IS GOING TO GET YOU TO A PLACE

2098
00:56:02,326 --> 00:56:03,694
TO MAKE A DECISION,

2099
00:56:03,694 --> 00:56:05,195
WHATEVER IT IS?

2100
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,363
>> I THOUGHT I MADE MY DECISION.

2101
00:56:06,363 --> 00:56:07,665
BUT I THINK ONE THING,

2102
00:56:07,665 --> 00:56:08,733
AND THEN SOMETHING COMES UP,

2103
00:56:08,733 --> 00:56:09,934
AND I THINK ANOTHER THING,

2104
00:56:09,934 --> 00:56:10,735
AND IT'S HARD TO STICK

2105
00:56:10,735 --> 00:56:11,669
TO ONE DECISION.

2106
00:56:11,669 --> 00:56:13,504
>> IT'S NEVER GOING TO FEEL

2107
00:56:13,504 --> 00:56:18,242
100% RIGHT, EITHER WAY,

2108
00:56:18,242 --> 00:56:19,610
PARENTING OR NOT.

2109
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:20,511
IT'S NOT.

2110
00:56:20,511 --> 00:56:22,513
BUT THERE IS STRENGTH

2111
00:56:22,513 --> 00:56:24,014
IN BOTH OF THEM, AND I THINK

2112
00:56:24,014 --> 00:56:25,883
THAT YOU'RE GETTING CAUGHT UP

2113
00:56:25,883 --> 00:56:27,051
IN WEAKNESS.

2114
00:56:27,051 --> 00:56:28,953
ABSOLUTELY NOT.

2115
00:56:28,953 --> 00:56:30,755
>> LIKE, KENNY AND LISA,

2116
00:56:30,755 --> 00:56:32,222
THEY CAN GUARANTEE HER A FUTURE

2117
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:33,290
AND COLLEGE, AND I CAN'T

2118
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:34,525
EVEN GUARANTEE HER

2119
00:56:34,525 --> 00:56:35,826
HER FUTURE RIGHT NOW.

2120
00:56:35,826 --> 00:56:37,294
SOMETIMES I THINK, LIKE,

2121
00:56:37,294 --> 00:56:38,162
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE WENT

2122
00:56:38,162 --> 00:56:39,396
AND GOT HER--

2123
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:40,931
JUST, LIKE, DEALT WITH IT

2124
00:56:40,931 --> 00:56:41,732
IF I WAS GOING TO MAKE

2125
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:45,703
THE DECISION ANYWAY.

2126
00:56:45,703 --> 00:56:47,304
>> BUT YOU HAVE THE CONFIDENCE

2127
00:56:47,304 --> 00:56:48,773
TO KNOW THAT YOU TRIED

2128
00:56:48,773 --> 00:56:49,540
AND YOU DID IT.

2129
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:50,741
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE TO

2130
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:55,946
THINK, "WHAT IF I NEVER TRIED?"

2131
00:56:55,946 --> 00:56:57,982
DO YOU FEEL LIKE

2132
00:56:57,982 --> 00:57:00,951
YOU COULD CALL THEM, OR--

2133
00:57:00,951 --> 00:57:05,523
>> I GUESS I HAVE TO.

2134
00:57:05,523 --> 00:57:07,625
[line ringing]

2135
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:08,759
>> HELLO?

2136
00:57:08,759 --> 00:57:09,794
>> LISA?

2137
00:57:09,794 --> 00:57:10,595
>> HEY, ASH.

2138
00:57:10,595 --> 00:57:11,729
>> I'M HERE WITH ASHLEY

2139
00:57:11,729 --> 00:57:13,631
FROM GLADNEY, THE COUNSELOR.

2140
00:57:13,631 --> 00:57:14,899
AND WE WERE JUST TALKING

2141
00:57:14,899 --> 00:57:15,900
AND, LIKE, SORTING THROUGH

2142
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:16,834
EVERYTHING.

2143
00:57:16,834 --> 00:57:17,935
AND I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IT.

2144
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:19,303
I JUST THINK THE BEST THING

2145
00:57:19,303 --> 00:57:21,739
IS NOT WITH ME, 'CAUSE I JUST

2146
00:57:21,739 --> 00:57:23,307
THINK Y'ALL CAN GUARANTEE HER

2147
00:57:23,307 --> 00:57:25,610
BETTER THAN WHAT I CAN.

2148
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:26,477
>> IF YOU FEEL LIKE

2149
00:57:26,477 --> 00:57:27,512
THE BEST THING FOR CALLIE

2150
00:57:27,512 --> 00:57:28,345
IS TO BE WITH US,

2151
00:57:28,345 --> 00:57:30,080
THEN WE WANT--YOU KNOW,

2152
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:30,915
WE WANT TO.

2153
00:57:30,915 --> 00:57:34,652
BUT I JUST WANT YOU TO REALLY

2154
00:57:34,652 --> 00:57:36,821
BE VERY, VERY SURE,

2155
00:57:36,821 --> 00:57:39,423
BECAUSE WE JUST--WE'RE AFRAID.

2156
00:57:39,423 --> 00:57:40,224
WE DON'T WANT TO DO

2157
00:57:40,224 --> 00:57:41,225
THE BACK AND FORTH.

2158
00:57:41,225 --> 00:57:42,126
>> NO, NO, NO.

2159
00:57:42,126 --> 00:57:44,028
>> IT'S HARD ON ALL OF US.

2160
00:57:44,028 --> 00:57:44,829
>> I WOULDN'T HAVE--

2161
00:57:44,829 --> 00:57:45,663
LIKE, I DON'T WANT HER

2162
00:57:45,663 --> 00:57:46,430
BACK AND FORTH.

2163
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:47,965
>> SO WHAT TIME FRAME

2164
00:57:47,965 --> 00:57:49,366
ARE YOU THINKING, ASHLEY?

2165
00:57:49,366 --> 00:57:50,901
>> I THINK THIS WEEKEND,

2166
00:57:50,901 --> 00:57:52,870
IF THAT'S OKAY WITH YOU GUYS.

2167
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:54,038
>> THAT'S FINE.

2168
00:57:54,038 --> 00:57:54,839
>> YEAH, I DON'T WANT

2169
00:57:54,839 --> 00:57:56,106
TO PROLONG IT.

2170
00:57:56,106 --> 00:57:58,075
>> RIGHT, RIGHT.

2171
00:57:58,075 --> 00:57:59,276
WELL, WE LOVE YOU, ASHLEY.

2172
00:57:59,276 --> 00:58:00,277
>> I KNOW.

2173
00:58:00,277 --> 00:58:01,478
I LOVE YOU GUYS TOO.

2174
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:02,747
>> OKAY.

2175
00:58:02,747 --> 00:58:03,581
>> OKAY.

2176
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:04,815
>> TALK TO YOU LATER.

2177
00:58:04,815 --> 00:58:05,750
>> OKAY, BYE.

2178
00:58:05,750 --> 00:58:10,721
>> BYE-BYE.

2179
00:58:10,721 --> 00:58:11,889
>> SO HOW DO YOU FEEL?

2180
00:58:11,889 --> 00:58:13,891
I MEAN, YOU JUST BASICALLY MADE

2181
00:58:13,891 --> 00:58:15,125
A DECISION.

2182
00:58:15,125 --> 00:58:16,961
>> I MEAN, I FEEL OKAY.

2183
00:58:16,961 --> 00:58:20,297
I JUST FEEL REALLY SAD.

2184
00:58:20,297 --> 00:58:22,567
>> THAT'S OKAY.

2185
00:58:22,567 --> 00:58:23,834
YOU'VE REALLY DONE THE WORK.

2186
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:24,869
YOU HAVEN'T JUST MADE

2187
00:58:24,869 --> 00:58:26,436
THESE REALLY DRASTIC, FAST

2188
00:58:26,436 --> 00:58:31,041
DECISIONS.

2189
00:58:31,041 --> 00:58:34,211
YOU WILL SEE HER AGAIN.

2190
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:51,195
>> TOMORROW

2191
00:58:51,195 --> 00:58:52,196
CALLIE IS HEADING BACK

2192
00:58:52,196 --> 00:58:53,397
TO LIVE WITH MY AUNT AND UNCLE.

2193
00:58:53,397 --> 00:58:54,331
SO WE HAVE TO PACK UP

2194
00:58:54,331 --> 00:58:55,465
ALL THE BABY STUFF

2195
00:58:55,465 --> 00:58:57,534
THAT THEY SHIPPED UP.

2196
00:59:03,207 --> 00:59:03,908
HI.

2197
00:59:03,908 --> 00:59:05,876
TAKING CALLIE TO HARLINGEN

2198
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:06,911
BY MYSELF WOULD JUST BE

2199
00:59:06,911 --> 00:59:08,613
TOO MUCH, SO MY MOM AGREED

2200
00:59:08,613 --> 00:59:11,015
TO DO IT FOR ME.

2201
00:59:11,015 --> 00:59:12,382
AND MY FRIEND SHELLEY

2202
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:13,651
IS COMING OVER SO I DON'T

2203
00:59:13,651 --> 00:59:14,652
HAVE TO BE ALONE

2204
00:59:14,652 --> 00:59:16,020
AFTER THEY LEAVE.

2205
00:59:16,020 --> 00:59:18,155
THANKS FOR COMING.

2206
00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:19,724
>> WHAT TIME IS SHE LEAVING?

2207
00:59:19,724 --> 00:59:22,660
>> SOON.

2208
00:59:22,660 --> 00:59:24,829
YEAH.

2209
01:00:28,558 --> 01:00:30,460
I STILL MISS CALLIE A LOT.

2210
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,395
I THINK I'LL MISS HER

2211
01:00:31,395 --> 01:00:32,462
EVERY SINGLE DAY

2212
01:00:32,462 --> 01:00:33,831
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

2213
01:00:33,831 --> 01:00:35,265
>> OKAY.

2214
01:00:35,265 --> 01:00:36,266
>> NO MATTER WHAT,

2215
01:00:36,266 --> 01:00:37,434
I JUST SEE HER BEING LOVED

2216
01:00:37,434 --> 01:00:40,004
AND TAKEN CARE OF.

2217
01:00:40,004 --> 01:00:41,772
NOW I UNDERSTAND SOMEWHAT

2218
01:00:41,772 --> 01:00:43,273
WHAT IT WAS LIKE FOR MY MOM

2219
01:00:43,273 --> 01:00:44,842
TO HAVE ME SO YOUNG

2220
01:00:44,842 --> 01:00:46,410
AND THE HARD DECISIONS

2221
01:00:46,410 --> 01:00:48,178
THAT SHE HAD TO FACE.

2222
01:00:48,178 --> 01:00:49,579
I KIND OF WANTED TO END

2223
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:50,848
THAT PATTERN.

2224
01:00:50,848 --> 01:00:52,249
WHAT I DO TO PUSH ASIDE

2225
01:00:52,249 --> 01:00:53,718
THE BAD FEELINGS OF MISSING HER

2226
01:00:53,718 --> 01:00:54,719
AND WANTING HER BACK

2227
01:00:54,719 --> 01:00:56,286
IS JUST FOCUSING ON THE FUTURE

2228
01:00:56,286 --> 01:00:57,421
AND MOVING ON.

2229
01:00:57,421 --> 01:00:58,555
I JUST KNOW THAT I'M GOING

2230
01:00:58,555 --> 01:00:59,623
TO GO TO COLLEGE,

2231
01:00:59,623 --> 01:01:01,025
GET A CAREER, AND MOVE ON

2232

WHAT'S SO GREAT ABOUT

2236
01:01:04,561 --> 01:01:06,296
THE NEW SCHOOL SPECIFICALLY IS,

2239
01:01:08,632 --> 01:01:10,935
