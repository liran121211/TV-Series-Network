1
00:00:03,304 --> 00:00:04,472
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU KEPT SAYING.

2
00:00:04,472 --> 00:00:05,139
[chime dings]

3
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:06,640
HI, I'M SABRINA.

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,176
I'M 17 YEARS OLD AND GREW UP

5
00:00:08,176 --> 00:00:09,810
IN LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA.

6
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,179
MY PARENTS SPLIT UP WHEN I WAS

7
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:13,581
A KID, AND AFTER LIVING WITH MY

8
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:15,149
DAD FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS,

9
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:17,185
I DECIDED I WANTED TO BE NEAR MY

10
00:00:17,185 --> 00:00:19,087
MOM, SO AFTER MY JUNIOR YEAR,

11
00:00:19,087 --> 00:00:21,189
I PACKED MY THINGS AND MOVED ALL

12
00:00:21,189 --> 00:00:22,123
THE WAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY

13
00:00:22,123 --> 00:00:23,857
TO FRANKLIN, TENNESSEE.

14
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,059
THERE'S SO MUCH MORE, LIKE,

15
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:26,294
NATURE OUT HERE.

16
00:00:26,294 --> 00:00:27,328
IT'S A LOT DIFFERENT HERE,

17
00:00:27,328 --> 00:00:28,696
AND MY MOM'S HOUSE IS ALWAYS

18
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:29,763
HECTIC, BECAUSE SHE HAS

19
00:00:29,763 --> 00:00:30,764
THREE LITTLE KIDS.

20
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:32,133
>> DON'T HIT ME.

21
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:32,833
>> NO.

22
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:33,934
>> SAY YOU'RE SORRY.

23
00:00:33,934 --> 00:00:35,269
>> SO ME AND MY SISTER REBECCA

24
00:00:35,269 --> 00:00:36,070
LIVE NEARBY

25
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,071
AT OUR GRANDPARENTS' HOUSE,

26
00:00:37,071 --> 00:00:38,139
WHERE THERE'S MORE SPACE.

27
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:39,140
WHY DOES YOUR HAIR OR MY HAIR

28
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:39,973
ALWAYS END UP IN MY SPAGHETTI?

29
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:42,343
>> IT'S YOUR HAIR.

30
00:00:42,343 --> 00:00:43,611
>> MY SISTER AND I ARE REALLY

31
00:00:43,611 --> 00:00:45,213
CLOSE, BUT I MISS MY FRIENDS

32
00:00:45,213 --> 00:00:46,280
BACK IN CALIFORNIA...

33
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:46,980
>> HELLO?

34
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,116
>> ESPECIALLY MY BOYFRIEND,

35
00:00:48,116 --> 00:00:48,949
IMAN.

36
00:00:48,949 --> 00:00:50,251
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR A COUPLE

37
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:51,552
OF YEARS, AND MOVING AWAY HAS

38
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:52,753
BEEN KIND OF HARD ON OUR

39
00:00:52,753 --> 00:00:53,754
RELATIONSHIP.

40
00:00:53,754 --> 00:00:54,688
BUT NOW IMAN IS THINKING

41
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:56,190
ABOUT MOVING TO TENNESSEE TO BE

42
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:56,857
WITH ME.

43
00:00:56,857 --> 00:00:58,326
>> I CAN'T SAY "I-MAN" VERY--

44
00:00:58,326 --> 00:00:59,793
>> IMAN, NOT "I-MAN."

45
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:00,461
>> SEE?

46
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:02,096
I DON'T KNOW HIM AT ALL.

47
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:03,231
>> THINGS WILL DEFINITELY BE A

48
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:04,498
LITTLE AWKWARD IF HE MOVES HERE,

49
00:01:04,498 --> 00:01:05,966
BUT I'M DETERMINED TO MAKE IT

50
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:08,569
WORK, BECAUSE I'M PREGNANT.

51
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:18,746
LIVING HERE IN TENNESSEE IS SO

52
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:19,947
MUCH DIFFERENT THAN MY LIFE BACK

53
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:21,715
IN CALIFORNIA, BUT I REALLY

54
00:01:21,715 --> 00:01:22,916
MISSED HAVING MY MOM AROUND

55
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,051
WHEN I WAS A KID.

56
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:25,153
 MADRE! 

57
00:01:25,153 --> 00:01:26,086
AND AFTER I FOUND OUT I WAS

58
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,488
PREGNANT, I KNEW I NEEDED HER

59
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:28,756
MORE THAN EVER.

60
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:29,957
I WISH WE COULD LIVE TOGETHER,

61
00:01:29,957 --> 00:01:31,325
BUT I GUESS THIS IS THE NEXT

62
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:32,293
BEST THING.

63
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:34,962
>> WHEN YOU WENT WITH YOUR DAD,

64
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:36,864
WHEN YOU WERE AROUND SEVEN,

65
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:37,831
IT'S BECAUSE I WAS HAVING

66
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,367
LOTS OF PROBLEMS.

67
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:41,335
I WASN'T STABLE ENOUGH TO TAKE

68
00:01:41,335 --> 00:01:42,236
CARE OF YOU.

69
00:01:42,236 --> 00:01:43,337
>> WHEN I WAS LITTLE, I

70
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:45,906
REMEMBER, LIKE, I'D ALWAYS WANT

71
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:47,175
TO BE WITH YOU AND STUFF, BUT,

72
00:01:47,175 --> 00:01:48,776
YOU KNOW, LIKE, IN SOME WAYS,

73
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:49,743
I THINK IT WAS, LIKE,

74
00:01:49,743 --> 00:01:50,878
BEST FOR ME TO BE THERE,

75
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:52,413
BUT A LOT OF TIME, I JUST

76
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:53,414
WANTED TO BE WITH YOU.

77
00:01:53,414 --> 00:01:55,583
>> YOUR DAD DID THE BEST THAT

78
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,351
HE KNEW HOW.

79
00:01:57,351 --> 00:01:58,452
YOU KNOW, HE SHOULDN'T HAVE

80
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,754
GAVE YOU SO MUCH FREEDOM.

81
00:02:00,754 --> 00:02:02,089
DID YOUR DAD TALK TO YOU ABOUT

82
00:02:02,089 --> 00:02:04,358
BIRTH CONTROL EVER?

83
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:06,394
>> NO, WE NEVER EVEN TALKED.

84
00:02:06,394 --> 00:02:07,661
I LEARNED, LIKE, WHAT SEX WAS,

85
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:09,463
LIKE, IN THE SEX ED CLASS,

86
00:02:09,463 --> 00:02:10,531
'CAUSE IT WAS, LIKE, MANDATORY

87
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:11,432
TO TAKE.

88
00:02:11,432 --> 00:02:12,466
>> I KNOW I'VE TALKED TO YOU

89
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,067
ABOUT IT.

90
00:02:14,067 --> 00:02:15,603
I KNOW I'VE TOLD YOU STUFF--

91
00:02:15,603 --> 00:02:18,071
THAT YOU'RE NOT READY.

92
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:19,407
>> YOU GUYS, LIKE, ALWAYS TOLD

93
00:02:19,407 --> 00:02:22,843
ME TO PREVENT IT, BUT, LIKE,

94
00:02:22,843 --> 00:02:23,844
IN THE CLASS, THEY ACTUALLY

95
00:02:23,844 --> 00:02:25,112
SHOWED ME, LIKE, WHAT IT WAS.

96
00:02:25,112 --> 00:02:27,147
>> WE JUST TOLD YOU NOT TO,

97
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,816
INSTEAD OF ACTUALLY TELLING YOU

98
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:31,952
WHAT IT WAS AND WHY YOU

99
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:33,554
SHOULDN'T DO IT.

100
00:02:33,554 --> 00:02:34,722
WE JUST TOLD YOU, "DON'T."

101
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:36,224
I MEAN, WE ALL MAKE OUR

102
00:02:36,224 --> 00:02:38,125
MISTAKES, AND NOBODY'S PERFECT

103
00:02:38,125 --> 00:02:39,393
AS PARENTS, AND YOU'RE GOING TO

104
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:40,961
LEARN THAT TOO.

105
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:43,931
IT SURPRISES ME THAT YOU MADE

106
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:46,434
THOSE TYPE OF DECISIONS, BUT IT

107
00:02:46,434 --> 00:02:48,869
DOESN'T MAKE YOU A BAD PERSON,

108
00:02:48,869 --> 00:02:50,971
AT ALL.

109
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:53,474
IT JUST--YOU DID SOMETHING,

110
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:56,277
AND NOW YOU GOT TO PAY THE

111
00:02:56,277 --> 00:02:58,379
CONSEQUENCES.

112
00:02:58,379 --> 00:02:59,347
>> EVEN THOUGH I DON'T LIVE WITH

113
00:02:59,347 --> 00:03:01,081
HER, IT'S NICE FINALLY HAVING MY

114
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:02,283
MOM AROUND TO TALK TO.

115
00:03:02,283 --> 00:03:03,584
[chime dings]

116
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:04,752
GROWING UP IN A BROKEN HOME

117
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:06,420
WAS REALLY PAINFUL, AND I'M

118
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,721
DESPERATE FOR MY BABY TO HAVE

119
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,423
BOTH PARENTS IN ITS LIFE.

120
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:10,724
I WAS NERVOUS ABOUT MOVING SO

121
00:03:10,724 --> 00:03:12,460
FAR AWAY FROM IMAN AFTER I GOT

122
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:14,094
PREGNANT, BUT HE PROMISED ME HE

123
00:03:14,094 --> 00:03:15,563
WAS SAVING HIS MONEY AND WOULD

124
00:03:15,563 --> 00:03:16,864
MAKE IT TO TENNESSEE BEFORE THE

125
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,098
BABY CAME.

126
00:03:18,098 --> 00:03:19,633
BUT I'M DUE IN SIX WEEKS,

127
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:20,934
AND IMAN STILL DOESN'T HAVE

128
00:03:20,934 --> 00:03:22,169
HIS PLANE TICKET.

129
00:03:22,169 --> 00:03:23,036
HELLO?

130
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,238
>> WHERE YOU AT?

131
00:03:24,238 --> 00:03:26,240
>> I'M IN MY BACKYARD.

132
00:03:27,908 --> 00:03:29,176
>> MY SISTER.

133
00:03:29,176 --> 00:03:31,111
>> DID HE BUY THE TICKETS YET?

134
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:33,647
>> NO, HE'S WAITING TO BUY THEM.

135
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:35,215
>> OH.

136
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:36,484
WHEN DOES, LIKE, HE PLAN ON

137
00:03:36,484 --> 00:03:37,385
COMING OUT HERE?

138
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:40,554
>> NOT TILL THE DAY OF--LIKE, MY

139
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:42,990
DUE DATE, AUGUST 26TH, RIGHT?

140
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,191
IS THAT WHEN YOU'RE COMING OUT?

141
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:45,359
>> WHAT IF IT COMES EARLY, AND

142
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:47,661
HE'S GOING TO MISS EVERYTHING?

143
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:49,096
>> [sighs]

144
00:03:49,096 --> 00:03:51,299
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST COME,

145
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:53,301
LIKE, EARLIER?

146
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:56,003
>> A FAMILY THING.

147
00:03:56,003 --> 00:03:56,970
>> SO THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAN

148
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,973
HIS FAMILY THAT HE MADE?

149
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,342
>> ARE YOU EXCITED TO COME OUT,

150
00:04:01,342 --> 00:04:02,175
OR DO YOU NOT WANT TO COME OUT

151
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,177
ANYMORE?

152
00:04:07,348 --> 00:04:08,482
>> WHERE IS IMAN GOING TO STAY

153
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:09,483
WHEN HE GETS OUT HERE?

154
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,352
>> HE'S--WELL, HE WAS GOING TO

155
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:13,687
STAY OVER HERE.

156
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:14,688
[laughs]

157
00:04:14,688 --> 00:04:16,223
>> HE'S NOT TAKING MY ROOM.

158
00:04:16,223 --> 00:04:17,391
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING

159
00:04:17,391 --> 00:04:18,326
TO BE LIKE, LIKE, WHEN YOU COME

160
00:04:18,326 --> 00:04:20,328
OUT HERE?

161
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:32,306
>> WELL, ONCE YOU KNOW WHEN

162
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:33,040
YOU'RE GETTING OUT,

163
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,074
THEN TELL ME.

164
00:04:34,074 --> 00:04:34,875
>> I LOVE YOU.

165
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:37,845
>> I LOVE YOU TOO.

166
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:39,012
NONSENSE.

167
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:39,680
[laughs]

168
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,582
>> SOMETIMES I, LIKE--IT JUST

169
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:42,650
MAKES ME THINK, LIKE, HE'S

170
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:43,817
REALLY STUBBORN, AND HE'S NOT

171
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:44,785
WILLING TO GIVE UP THAT MUCH

172
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:47,621
FOR YOU.

173
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,122
>> LIKE, HE TELLS ME SO MUCH

174
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:51,759
THAT HE IS, AND I WANT TO

175
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,826
BELIEVE HIM, BUT...

176
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:53,861
>> I THINK, FOR ME, IN THE

177
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:55,896
BEGINNING WHEN IMAN MOVES OUT

178
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:56,764
HERE, IT'S GONNA BE, LIKE, A

179
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:59,600
LITTLE WEIRD AND UNCOMFORTABLE.

180
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,134
>> I KNOW MY SISTER IS WORRIED

181
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,202
THAT THINGS WILL CHANGE WHEN

182
00:05:02,202 --> 00:05:03,837
IMAN MOVES HERE, BUT I'M HOPING

183
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,238
WE CAN ALL MAKE IT WORK AND BE

184
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:08,642
A FAMILY.

185
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,378
DOES A SPATULA WORK TO GET

186
00:05:10,378 --> 00:05:11,645
SPAGHETTI OUT?

187
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:13,647
OH, I GUESS SO.

188
00:05:19,853 --> 00:05:21,622

00:05:21,622 --> 00:05:22,690
DO YOU KNOW FOR SURE?

00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:23,591
[both laugh]

191
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:24,758
I MEAN "I-MAN"?

192
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,159
SORRY, SABRINA, I HAVEN'T GOT

00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,595
USED TO THE NAME YET.

194
00:05:27,595 --> 00:05:28,462
>> I THOUGHT HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN

195
00:05:28,462 --> 00:05:29,897
HERE BY NOW.

196
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:31,865
>> YEAH, I DO TOO.

197
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,133
>> IT'S GONNA BE A LOT MORE

198
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:34,001
DIFFERENT WITH THE BABY HERE.

199
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:34,868
>> UH-HUH.

200
00:05:34,868 --> 00:05:35,869
>> NOISY.

201
00:05:35,869 --> 00:05:36,770
>> YEAH, BECAUSE ONCE THE BABY

202
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,472
COMES, IMAN'S COMING TOO.

203
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:39,707
SO IT'S GONNA GO FROM FOUR

204
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:41,074
PEOPLE AT THE TABLE TO SIX.

205
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:42,643
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT HOW

206
00:05:42,643 --> 00:05:44,077
LONG YOU MIGHT BE HERE?

207
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,345
>> LIKE, RIGHT AFTER I GRADUATE,

00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:46,514
WE'RE GONNA LOOK INTO, LIKE,

209
00:05:46,514 --> 00:05:47,948
OTHER PLACES.

210
00:05:47,948 --> 00:05:49,650
>> I THINK IT'S GONNA BE KIND OF

211
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,318
HARD ON YOU TO RENT AN APARTMENT

212
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:54,688
FOR, YOU KNOW, $1,000 A MONTH,

213
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,023
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU FIRST START

214
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,358

GRANDPARENTS ARE BEING SO COOL,

217
00:06:00,928 --> 00:06:02,396
BUT IF THEY'RE GONNA LET IMAN

218
00:06:02,396 --> 00:06:04,097
MOVE IN WITH US, I NEED TO KNOW

219
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:05,365

[line ringing]

222
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:09,670
>> HELLO?

224
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:12,105
>> SO WHAT'S UP?

225
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:13,441
>> LIKE, WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS

226
00:06:13,441 --> 00:06:15,476
WHEN YOU COME OUT HERE?

227
00:06:16,777 --> 00:06:17,711
>> SO DO YOU HAVE MONEY SAVED

228
00:06:17,711 --> 00:06:19,747
UP, OR ARE YOU SPENDING IT?

229
00:06:24,184 --> 00:06:25,385
>> SO YOU'RE NOT GONNA SAVE

230
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,387
ANYTHING FOR THE BABY?

231
00:06:31,158 --> 00:06:32,493

247
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,896
>> NO.

248
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:10,430
AFTER OUR TALK LAST NIGHT,

249
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:11,565
I'M WORRIED ABOUT IMAN MAKING

[chime dings]

253
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,268
SCHOOL STARTS RIGHT AROUND MY

CHANCE OF GRADUATING THIS YEAR.

I DON'T WANT TO JUST, LIKE,

00:07:33,086 --> 00:07:34,722
LEAVE HER WITH MOM OR GRANDMA

266
00:07:34,722 --> 00:07:35,523
ALL THE TIME.

267
00:07:35,523 --> 00:07:37,190
>> I THINK I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

268
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,828
YOU GETTING TOO FAR BEHIND IN

AT SCHOOL.

271
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,033
YOU MIGHT NOT HAVE TIME TO

272
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:48,201
ACTUALLY DO IT, WITH THE BABY.

273
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:52,005

FROM THE SCHOOL.

278
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,278
JUST A CERTAIN COUPLE OF HOURS,

279
00:07:58,278 --> 00:07:59,713
JUST SO I CAN GET MY STUFF AND

280
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:03,350
KEEP ON TRACK, AND THEN GO BACK

281
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,652
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

282
00:08:04,652 --> 00:08:06,987
OH, AND I HAVE TO GET FITTED

283
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,055

284
00:08:08,055 --> 00:08:09,757
LIKE, THE GOWN IS GONNA BE,

285
00:08:09,757 --> 00:08:11,091
LIKE, FIVE TIMES AS BIG ON ME.

288
00:08:14,628 --> 00:08:15,629
>> I'M LIKE, "SUBTRACT."

289
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:16,664
>> YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE

290
00:08:16,664 --> 00:08:17,865
THAT HUGE WHEN YOU'RE--

291
00:08:17,865 --> 00:08:20,568
>> I'M LIKE, "MEASURE HER."

292
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:26,640
IT'S HOT IN HERE, MOM.

293
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,075
>> NO, IT'S NOT.

294
00:08:28,075 --> 00:08:29,109
I JUST THINK YOU'RE NOT FEELING

295
00:08:29,109 --> 00:08:30,477
GOOD TODAY.

296
00:08:30,477 --> 00:08:31,511
>> I FEEL LIKE I'M SWEATING

297
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,680
TO DEATH.

298
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:34,147
MY DUE DATE IS LESS THAN A MONTH

299
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:35,616
AWAY, AND I STILL DON'T HAVE

300
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:36,750
EVERYTHING I'LL NEED FOR WHEN

301
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,618
THE BABY COMES HOME.

302
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:38,652
>> EVEN THAT CONSIGNMENT SALE

303
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:40,453
THAT WE WENT TO OVER HERE IN

304
00:08:40,453 --> 00:08:42,222
FRANKLIN, THOSE CRIBS WERE,

305
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:43,356
LIKE, $300 TO $400.

306
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:44,892
>> I KNOW.

307
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:46,393
AS SOON AS I FOUND OUT I WAS

308
00:08:46,393 --> 00:08:48,195
HAVING A GIRL, MY MOM AND

309
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:49,663
SISTER WANTED TO GO SHOPPING,

310
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:51,064
BUT SINCE IMAN IS STILL TRYING

311
00:08:51,064 --> 00:08:52,165
TO SAVE UP FOR A PLANE TICKET,

312
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,801
IT'S UP TO ME TO BUY EVERYTHING

313
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:55,669
WE NEED.

314
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:56,770
THE BABY NEEDS A TRAMPOLINE,

315
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:57,705
MOM.

316
00:08:57,705 --> 00:08:59,006
>> THE BABY NEEDS A TRAMPOLINE.

317
00:08:59,006 --> 00:09:00,173
>> THOSE ARE EXPENSIVE.

318
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,508
I ALMOST FORGOT.

319
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:03,343
YOU'RE GONNA NEED SOME PADS

320
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:04,878
FOR YOUR--

321
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:05,713
YOUR BOOBS ARE GONNA START

322
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:06,814
LEAKING AFTER THE BABY AND

323
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:08,716
PROBABLY BEFORE THE BABY.

324
00:09:08,716 --> 00:09:10,350
I DON'T KNOW.

325
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,151
>> THAT'S GROSS.

326
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:11,919
>> SO--BUT YOU'RE GONNA

327
00:09:11,919 --> 00:09:12,552
NEED PADS.

328
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:13,353
I ALMOST FORGOT ABOUT THAT.

329
00:09:13,353 --> 00:09:14,154
>> THAT'S NOT NORMAL.

330
00:09:14,154 --> 00:09:15,455
>> ARE YOU JUST PREPARED,

331
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:16,757
MENTALLY, FOR THE BABY TO COME

332
00:09:16,757 --> 00:09:18,926
NOW OR...

333
00:09:18,926 --> 00:09:19,860
>> NO.

334
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,527
[laughs]

335
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:21,762
>> WHAT IS THE NAMES YOU'RE

336
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:22,996
THINKING ABOUT FOR THE BABY?

337
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:24,364
>> REMEMBER, I TOLD YOU I WAS

338
00:09:24,364 --> 00:09:26,233
THINKING ABOUT AUDREY?

339
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,234
>> AUDREY?

340
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,368
NO, I DON'T LIKE AUDREY.

341
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:29,269
>> TOO BAD.

342
00:09:29,269 --> 00:09:31,104
>> AND IT'S GONNA HAVE IMAN'S

343
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:32,005
LAST NAME?

344
00:09:32,005 --> 00:09:33,774
>> YEAH.

345
00:09:33,774 --> 00:09:34,908
>> IT IS?

346
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,310
YOU'RE NOT MARRIED TO HIM.

347
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,912
>> BUT HE'S THE FATHER

348
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:39,947
OF THE BABY.

349
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:42,082
>> I THINK THAT IF HE SAVED THE

350
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:44,618
MONEY ENOUGH AND HE WAS

351
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:45,686
RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH TO SAVE

352
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:47,054
ENOUGH MONEY TO GET OUT HERE--

353
00:09:47,054 --> 00:09:48,221
>> TO SEE THE BABY.

354
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:49,723
>> TO SEE THE BABY, THEN HE

355
00:09:49,723 --> 00:09:52,059
DESERVES TO HAVE THE BABY NAMED

356
00:09:52,059 --> 00:09:53,093
AFTER HIM.

357
00:09:53,093 --> 00:09:54,127
DO YOU AGREE WITH ME?

358
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:55,028
>> YEAH.

359
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:56,596
WELL, THAT'S WHAT I THINK TOO.

360
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:57,597
LIKE, IF HE'S NOT GOING TO COME

361
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,566
OUT HERE AND EVERYTHING AFTER,

362
00:09:59,566 --> 00:10:00,600
LIKE, ALL THESE MONTHS OF HIM

363
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,135
SAYING THAT HE'S COMING OUT

364
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:02,970
HERE, THEN--

365
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,404
>> WELL, HE CAN'T JUST COME OUT

366
00:10:04,404 --> 00:10:06,073
HERE LAST-MINUTE EITHER.

367
00:10:06,073 --> 00:10:07,908
>> I FEEL SAD, BECAUSE I'M NOT

368
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:09,209
GONNA BE ABLE TO SPEND AS MUCH

369
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:11,244
TIME WITH YOU.

370
00:10:11,244 --> 00:10:12,880
>> WHAT ARE YOU UPSET ABOUT,

371
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,715
BECCA LEE?

372
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:16,149
>> THAT I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO

373
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:18,986
SPEND TIME WITH MY SISTER,

374
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:22,389
HANG OUT AND DO FUN STUFF

375
00:10:22,389 --> 00:10:24,191
LIKE WE ALWAYS DO.

376
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:25,525
IMAN'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE THERE

377
00:10:25,525 --> 00:10:26,994
TO DO STUFF WITH HER.

378
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:29,296
>> I FEEL LIKE EITHER--IF IMAN

379
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:30,964
WAS HERE OR NOT, I WOULD STILL

380
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,299
WANT YOU AROUND ALL THE TIME

381
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:33,834
AND EVERYTHING.

382
00:10:33,834 --> 00:10:35,803
[sniffling]

383
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:39,606
IF IMAN DOESN'T COME, I'M STUCK

384
00:10:39,606 --> 00:10:41,308
RAISING THIS BABY ALONE, AND IF

385
00:10:41,308 --> 00:10:42,876
HE DOES, I'M WORRIED ABOUT HOW

386
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:45,112
REBECCA WILL REACT.

387
00:10:45,112 --> 00:10:46,413
>> YOU CAN'T HARDLY LIFT

388
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:47,514
YOUR BELLY.

389
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:49,416
YOU HAVEN'T DROPPED YET.

390
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,483
>> ALL THE STRESS HAS BEEN

391
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,885
KEEPING ME UP AT NIGHT, AND MY

392
00:10:51,885 --> 00:10:54,454
FEET HAVE GOTTEN HUGE.

393
00:10:54,454 --> 00:10:56,289
>> SHE'S BEEN SWELLING LATELY,

394
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:57,490
AND I'VE BEEN WORRIED ABOUT

395
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,692
HER SWELLING.

396
00:10:58,692 --> 00:10:59,693
>> ACTUALLY, SWELLING IS NORMAL

397
00:10:59,693 --> 00:11:00,928
IN PREGNANCY.

398
00:11:00,928 --> 00:11:02,495
IT'S WHEN IT'S IN COMBINATION

399
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:05,465
WITH HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE--

400
00:11:05,465 --> 00:11:08,035
123 OVER 68.

401
00:11:08,035 --> 00:11:09,803
>> THAT'S GOOD.

402
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:12,005
[heart beating on ultrasound]

403
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,673
>> HELLO.

404
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,742
HOW YOU DOING?

405
00:11:14,742 --> 00:11:15,743
>> I'M GOOD.

406
00:11:15,743 --> 00:11:16,710
>> FEELING ALL RIGHT?

407
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,711
WHAT'S NEW?

408
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:18,545
>> SWELLING.

409
00:11:18,545 --> 00:11:19,446
>> YEAH.

410
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:20,180
>> SWELLING.

411
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,281
YOU KNOW WHY THAT IS?

412
00:11:21,281 --> 00:11:22,249
>> I'M PREGNANT?

413
00:11:22,249 --> 00:11:22,950
>> YOU'RE PREGNANT.

414
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,918
>> 'CAUSE YOU'RE PREGNANT.

415
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:26,619
>> YEAH.

416
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:30,457
>> THAT'S GOOD.

417
00:11:30,457 --> 00:11:31,892
EVERYTHING'S ON TRACK.

418
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:33,060
YOU SHOULD BE GOOD TO GO.

419
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,561
THE BABY'S MOVING PLENTY.

420
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:35,662
>> WELL, AND THEN HER BIRTH

421
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:37,230
CONTROL AFTER, PROBABLY

422
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:38,398
AN I.U.D. WOULD BE BEST.

423
00:11:38,398 --> 00:11:39,199
>> THAT'S WHAT I WOULD DO,

424
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:39,933
IF IT WAS ME.

425
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:40,567
>> WHAT'S THAT?

426
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:41,935
>> AN I.U.D. THAT LOOKS LIKE

427
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:43,771
A LITTLE ANCHOR, KIND OF...

428
00:11:43,771 --> 00:11:44,437
FFT!

429
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:45,739
>> [laughs]

430
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:46,740
YEAH, THERE YOU GO,

431
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,674
A LITTLE ANCHOR.

432
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:49,242
>> LITTLE ANCHOR.

433
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:50,443
>> SO HOW MANY PEOPLE CAN

434
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:52,479
ACTUALLY BE IN THE ROOM?

435
00:11:52,479 --> 00:11:53,413
>> I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S

436
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:54,547
A REAL HOSPITAL POLICY.

437
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:55,515
I MEAN, YOU OBVIOUSLY DON'T WANT

438
00:11:55,515 --> 00:11:56,583
A DOZEN PEOPLE IN THERE.

439
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:57,584
IT GETS KIND OF CRAZY.

440
00:11:57,584 --> 00:11:58,585
BUT YOUR IMMEDIATE FAMILY,

441
00:11:58,585 --> 00:11:59,987
MOST OF THE TIME, WE'RE FINE.

442
00:11:59,987 --> 00:12:00,687
YOU DON'T WANT IT TO

443
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:01,755
BE A CIRCUS.

444
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:03,223
THIS IS YOUR MOMENT.

445
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:04,424
THIS IS ABOUT YOU, SO I WOULD

446
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:05,558
JUST HAVE THE PEOPLE IN THERE

447
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:06,459
YOU WANT.

448
00:12:06,459 --> 00:12:07,727
>> OKAY.

449
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,529
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

450
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:10,430
>> THANK YOU.

451
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,766
>> THANKS.

452
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:14,001
>> I KNOW I'LL HAVE MY MOM

453
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:15,035
AND SISTER WITH ME IN THE

454
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:18,405
DELIVERY ROOM.

455
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,773
>> OOH, ICE CREAM.

456
00:12:19,773 --> 00:12:21,408
>> AND IF I CAN JUST MAKE IT

457
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:23,110
TO MY DUE DATE, IMAN MIGHT BE

458
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:26,346
THERE TOO.

459
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:28,348
SO IMAN JUST CALLED ME, LIKE,

460
00:12:28,348 --> 00:12:30,383
TWO SECONDS AGO.

461
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,052
>> DID YOU TALK TO HIM OR...

462
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:33,987
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

463
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:37,424
>> I'M AT THE ICE CREAM--

464
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:38,358
GELATO PLACE...THING.

465
00:12:38,358 --> 00:12:40,360
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

466
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:45,966
>> WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

467
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:49,803
>> WHY NOT?

468
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,641
>> OKAY.

469
00:13:01,048 --> 00:13:02,582
>> HANG UP.

470
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:05,886
>> OKAY, WHATEVER.

471
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:07,487
>> THAT WAS RUDE.

472
00:13:07,487 --> 00:13:10,557
>> [crying]

473
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:14,995
>> DID ANYTHING HAPPEN TO MAKE

474
00:13:14,995 --> 00:13:16,529
HIM MAD OR...

475
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:17,597
>> NO, LIKE, I HAVEN'T EVEN

476
00:13:17,597 --> 00:13:19,833
TALKED TO HIM, LIKE...

477
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,969
>> WHY IS HE BEING LIKE THAT

478
00:13:21,969 --> 00:13:22,970
TO YOU?

479
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,371
>> I DON'T KNOW.

480
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:28,508
HE'S NEVER LIKE THAT.

481
00:13:28,508 --> 00:13:30,277
>> MAYBE HE'S SCARED OF THE

482
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:31,879
RESPONSIBILITIES.

483
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:32,980
>> HE'S LIKE,

484
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,147
"OF COURSE I'M SCARED.

485
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:35,415
LIKE, AREN'T YOU SCARED OF

486
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:36,316
BEING A MOTHER?"

487
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:37,584
>> I'M LIKE, "YEAH, IT'S SCARY,"

488
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:39,219
BUT IT'S, LIKE, WHAT I HAVE

489
00:13:39,219 --> 00:13:40,587
TO DO.

490
00:13:40,587 --> 00:13:41,788
>> DO YOU THINK, IF HE DOESN'T

491
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:42,923
COME, YOU GUYS WILL TRY TO MAKE

492
00:13:42,923 --> 00:13:45,458
IT WORK OR...

493
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,826
JUST THAT'S IT?

494
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:48,028
>> IF HE'S NOT GONNA COME,

495
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:49,897
THEN I DON'T THINK WE'LL BE

496
00:13:49,897 --> 00:13:51,899
TOGETHER ANYMORE.

497
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:04,411
[laughter]

498
00:14:04,411 --> 00:14:05,412
>> I'VE BEEN SO WORRIED ABOUT

499
00:14:05,412 --> 00:14:06,379
IMAN GETTING HIS PLANE TICKET

500
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:07,747
THAT I HAVEN'T FELT LIKE HANGING

501
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:08,681
OUT WITH ANY OF MY FRIENDS

502
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,349
IN A WHILE.

503
00:14:09,349 --> 00:14:10,717
>> SO HOW DO YOU LIKE TENNESSEE

504
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:11,618
SO FAR?

505
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:13,353
>> I'M NOT USED TO IT.

506
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,754
AND SINCE EVERYBODY IS ABOUT TO

507
00:14:14,754 --> 00:14:16,689
GO BACK TO SCHOOL, AND I'M ABOUT

508
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,258
TO HAVE A BABY, I WON'T BE

509
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:20,060
SEEING THEM MUCH AFTER TODAY.

510
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,361
>> WE'RE GONNA GO LOOK IN THERE

511
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,695
FOR BABY CLOTHES.

512
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,264
>> OH, LOOK, BABY NAMES.

513
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:26,566
>> AUDREY!

514
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:27,634
THAT'S SO WEIRD.

515
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:29,369
>> SAY, "TENNESSEE," INSTEAD

516
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,370
OF "CHEESE."

517
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,340
[laughter]

518
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,707
>> SO WHERE ARE WE GOING NOW?

519
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,676
>> WE SHOULD GO DO SOME ARTS

520
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:37,544
AND CRAFTS.

521
00:14:37,544 --> 00:14:38,478
ARE YOU GUYS READY TO MAKE SOME

522
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:41,014
FINE ARTS?

523
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:42,115
>> SO, LIKE, ARE YOU READY

524
00:14:42,115 --> 00:14:43,850
FOR THE BABY TO COME?

525
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,152
>> SOME DAYS IT'S LIKE, "OKAY,

526
00:14:45,152 --> 00:14:46,019
I'M READY.

527
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:47,554
WHEN IS IT COMING?"

528
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:48,688
AND THEN OTHER DAYS, IT'S LIKE,

529
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:50,190
"OH, MY GOD."

530
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,458
>> DID YOU EVER THINK ABOUT,

531
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:55,062
LIKE, ABORTION OR ADOPTION?

532
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:56,463
>> I DIDN'T THINK OF ABORTION

533
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:57,397
AT ALL.

534
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,299
I KNEW I WANTED TO KEEP IT.

535
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:00,833
BUT IT WAS STILL, LIKE, YOU

536
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:01,834
KNOW, IN MY MIND, LIKE,

537
00:15:01,834 --> 00:15:02,936
"OH, WHAT IF..."

538
00:15:02,936 --> 00:15:04,137
IT WAS ALWAYS IN THE BACK OF MY

539
00:15:04,137 --> 00:15:05,438
MIND, LIKE, HOW MY LIFE WOULD

540
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,507
BE, LIKE, IF I DIDN'T HAVE HER

541
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:09,142
AND, LIKE, HOW IT WOULD CHANGE

542
00:15:09,142 --> 00:15:10,110
WITH HER THERE.

543
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,011
>> YEAH.

544
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:11,778
HOW DO YOU THINK THAT, LIKE,

545
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:12,845
THAT'S GONNA CHANGE, LIKE, YOURS

546
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:15,415
AND REBECCA'S RELATIONSHIP?

547
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,150
>> WELL, IT'S JUST GONNA BE

548
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:17,951
DIFFERENT.

549
00:15:17,951 --> 00:15:20,153
>> HOW DOES SHE FEEL ABOUT IMAN

550
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:21,521
COMING OUT AND MOVING IN

551
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:22,589
WITH YOU GUYS?

552
00:15:22,589 --> 00:15:24,057
>> SHE--SHE ACTS LIKE SHE

553
00:15:24,057 --> 00:15:25,758
DOESN'T EVEN WANT HIM TO COME.

554
00:15:25,758 --> 00:15:26,926
>> REALLY?

555
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,461
>> BECAUSE SHE'S LIKE, "HE'S NOT

556
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:29,796
GONNA GET HIS TICKET."

557
00:15:29,796 --> 00:15:30,863
>> YEAH.

558
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,465
>> YES, HE IS.

559
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:34,367
DESPITE WHAT MY SISTER THINKS...

560
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:35,202
[chime dings]

561
00:15:35,202 --> 00:15:36,269
I STILL HOPE IMAN WILL COME

562
00:15:36,269 --> 00:15:38,605
THROUGH FOR ME AND OUR BABY.

563
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,207
AND LATER THAT NIGHT, HE CALLED

564
00:15:40,207 --> 00:15:42,709
AND SAID HE BOUGHT A TICKET.

565
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:44,411
HIS FLIGHT'S NOT TILL NEXT WEEK,

566
00:15:44,411 --> 00:15:45,912
SO I JUST HAVE TO MAKE IT TO MY

567
00:15:45,912 --> 00:15:48,215
DUE DATE, BUT THE NEXT MORNING,

568
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:49,949
I WOKE UP FEELING DIZZY AND WITH

569
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,452
A BADLY SWOLLEN FOOT.

570
00:15:52,452 --> 00:15:53,720
MY MOM CALLED THE DOCTOR, JUST

571
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:56,289
TO, LIKE, LET HIM KNOW, LIKE,

572
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,290
HOW, LIKE, MY FOOT IS, LIKE,

573
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:58,458
REALLY SWOLLEN.

574
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,960
SO HE JUST WANTED ME TO GO IN

575
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,195
TO MAKE SURE EVERYTHING WAS OKAY

576
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:03,496
AND STUFF.

577
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:04,331
NO, HE TOLD ME TO GO

578
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:05,398
TO THE HOSPITAL.

579
00:16:05,398 --> 00:16:06,666
I DON'T WANT TO GO INTO LABOR

580
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,501
BEFORE IMAN GETS HERE, BUT WHEN

581
00:16:08,501 --> 00:16:09,702
I GOT TO THE HOSPITAL, THE NURSE

582
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:10,937
SAID I WAS SHOWING SIGNS OF

583
00:16:10,937 --> 00:16:13,873
PREECLAMPSIA.

584
00:16:13,873 --> 00:16:15,008
>> A LOT OF TIMES WITH

585
00:16:15,008 --> 00:16:17,310
PREECLAMPSIA, PATIENTS COME IN,

586
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,611
AND THEY'RE FINE, THEY'RE FINE,

587
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,713
THEY'RE FINE, AND THEN THEY WAKE

588
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:22,682
UP ONE DAY, AND THEIR NOSE IS

589
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:23,650
PUFFY, AND THEY HAVE THE WORST

590
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:24,751
HEADACHE OF THEIR LIFE, AND THEY

591
00:16:24,751 --> 00:16:26,253
JUST SAY, "I JUST FEEL HORRIBLE.

592
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:27,487
I'M VOMITING."

593
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,888
I'M GOING TO CALL DR. LODGE AND

594
00:16:28,888 --> 00:16:30,323
SEE WHAT HE WANTS TO DO, AND I

595
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:31,691
WILL COME IN IN A COUPLE MINUTES

596
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:33,593
AND LET YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID.

597
00:16:33,593 --> 00:16:35,662
>> THANK YOU.

598
00:16:42,035 --> 00:16:43,536
>> OKAY, SO HE'S DECIDED TO

599
00:16:43,536 --> 00:16:46,106
DELIVER YOU, OKAY?

600
00:16:46,106 --> 00:16:47,707
IT'S TIME TO STAY.

601
00:16:47,707 --> 00:16:48,775
WHAT'S WRONG?

602
00:16:48,775 --> 00:16:49,642
>> HER BOYFRIEND'S NOT HERE

603
00:16:49,642 --> 00:16:50,910
FROM CALIFORNIA YET, SO SHE'S

604
00:16:50,910 --> 00:16:52,212
SO UPSET.

605
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:53,513
HE COMES THURSDAY.

606
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:56,216
HE'S GONNA MISS IT.

607
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:59,052
LET'S CALL HIM, HONEY.

608
00:16:59,052 --> 00:17:01,088
>> HELLO?

609
00:17:05,392 --> 00:17:06,959
>> OH, MY GOD, YOU'RE SHAKING

610
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,095
SO BAD.

611
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,197
WE'RE HAVING A BABY.

612
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:13,733
>> [crying]

613
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:16,269
MM-HMM.

614
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:17,604
>> SO I'M GOING TO NEED TO START

615
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:18,505
AN I.V.

616
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:20,207
IS THAT OKAY WITH YOU?

617
00:17:20,207 --> 00:17:21,908
OKAY, ONE, TWO, THREE.

618
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,710
WE'LL START THAT PITOCIN.

619
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:24,611
>> IS SHE GOING TO START

620
00:17:24,611 --> 00:17:26,246
BEING IN PAIN NOW BECAUSE OF

621
00:17:26,246 --> 00:17:26,979
THAT STUFF?

622
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:27,914
>> SHE WILL START FEELING

623
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:29,048
SOME CRAMPING.

624
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,050
IT'LL BE A GRADUAL THING.

625
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,662
>> [exhales]

626
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:43,496
>> YOU WONDERED WHAT

627
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:44,897
A CONTRACTION FELT LIKE,

628
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:46,866
AND NOW YOU KNOW.

629
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:49,802
>> OW, IT HURTS MY BACK.

630
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:51,003
THE CONTRACTIONS STARTED GETTING

631
00:17:51,003 --> 00:17:52,672
REALLY PAINFUL, SO I DECIDED TO

632
00:17:52,672 --> 00:17:55,142
GET AN EPIDURAL.

633
00:17:55,142 --> 00:17:55,975
>> ALL RIGHT, SWEETIE, SO WHAT

634
00:17:55,975 --> 00:17:56,976
WE'RE GONNA HAVE YOU DO IS,

635
00:17:56,976 --> 00:17:58,145
YOU'RE GONNA SIT UP

636
00:17:58,145 --> 00:18:00,147
FACING TOWARDS ME.

637
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,385
OKAY, IT'S GONNA FEEL LIKE

638
00:18:05,385 --> 00:18:06,052
A LITTLE TWINGE.

639
00:18:06,052 --> 00:18:07,154
TAKE A BIG DEEP BREATH.

640
00:18:07,154 --> 00:18:08,388
DULL, ACHY PRESSURE.

641
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:09,689
LOTS OF PRESSURE, THOUGH.

642
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:10,990
GREAT JOB.

643
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,058
OKAY, THAT'S IT.

644
00:18:12,058 --> 00:18:14,661
YOU CAN RELAX.

645
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:17,164
HEAD ON BACK.

646
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:18,097
YOU MIGHT NOTICE YOUR LEGS ARE

647
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,366
GOING TO START TO GET WARM,

648
00:18:19,366 --> 00:18:20,500
TINGLY, MAYBE A LITTLE HEAVY

649
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,468
HERE IN THE NEXT FEW.

650
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:22,635
I PROMISE IT'LL WORK ITS WAY UP

651
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:23,436
TO YOUR BELLY.

652
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,137
>> OKAY.

653
00:18:24,137 --> 00:18:26,139

>> WELL, YEAH, YOU'RE COMPLETE.

659
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:39,486
THE HEAD'S RIGHT THERE.

00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,971
OKAY, JUST SUPPORT THEM.

OH, SHE'S TURNING PURPLE.

SHE'S TURNING PURPLE.

[crying stops]

703
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:02,602
>> I WAS SO HAPPY TO BE DONE

704
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:04,170
WITH LABOR, BUT WHEN AUDREY

705
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,239
SUDDENLY STOPPED CRYING, I COULD

706
00:20:06,239 --> 00:20:09,276
TELL SOMETHING WAS WRONG.

707
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:10,343
>> WE NEED NICU NOW.

708
00:20:10,343 --> 00:20:11,177

709
00:20:11,177 --> 00:20:12,512
>> THEY'RE HERE.

00:20:12,512 --> 00:20:13,646
>> WHAT'S GOING ON?

711
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:14,314
>> IT'S OKAY.

712
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:15,248
IT'S OKAY.

713
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:16,283
IT'S OKAY.

714
00:20:16,283 --> 00:20:17,884
>> OH, MY BABY.

715
00:20:17,884 --> 00:20:19,886
GOD, LORD, JESUS!

716
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:31,931
>> THEY TOOK AUDREY TO INTENSIVE

717
00:20:31,931 --> 00:20:33,466
CARE RIGHT AFTER SHE WAS BORN,

718
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:34,834
AND I'M WAITING TO HEAR IF

719
00:20:34,834 --> 00:20:36,168
SHE'S OKAY.

720
00:20:36,168 --> 00:20:38,538
I CAN'T STOP SHAKING.

721
00:20:38,538 --> 00:20:39,806
>> IT'S A LITTLE SCARY.

722
00:20:39,806 --> 00:20:41,073
>> YEAH.

723
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:42,509
>> ARE YOU OKAY?

724
00:20:42,509 --> 00:20:43,810
MY BEST GUESS WOULD BE THAT THE

725
00:20:43,810 --> 00:20:46,346
BABY GOT SOME FLUID IN THE BACK

726
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:48,348
OF ITS THROAT, MAYBE DOWN--

727
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:49,482
THAT WENT INTO ITS LUNGS.

728
00:20:49,482 --> 00:20:50,717
IT ALL HAPPENED VERY QUICKLY.

729
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:52,285
SO SHE'S JUST GONNA GO TO NICU.

730
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:53,453
THEY'RE GONNA WATCH HER FOR

731
00:20:53,453 --> 00:20:54,387
A LITTLE BIT.

732
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:55,588
I KNOW IT WAS A LITTLE BIT

733
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:56,723
SCARY.

734
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:58,725
ALL RIGHT, I'LL BE BACK.

735
00:21:02,729 --> 00:21:04,497
>> I HAVE TO CALL PEOPLE NOW.

736
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:07,534
HELLO?

737
00:21:07,534 --> 00:21:10,537
THE BABY CAME.

738
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:11,838
SHE, LIKE, STOPPED BREATHING

739
00:21:11,838 --> 00:21:14,407
FOR A LITTLE BIT.

740
00:21:14,407 --> 00:21:15,575
WHERE'D YOU GUYS GO,

741
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:16,676
TO THE NICU?

742
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:17,510
>> YEAH.

743
00:21:17,510 --> 00:21:18,311
>> THEY'RE GONNA KEEP HER

744
00:21:18,311 --> 00:21:19,111
DOWN THERE.

745
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,046
>> WHY?

746
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:21,047
>> BECAUSE THEY THINK SHE MIGHT

747
00:21:21,047 --> 00:21:23,082
HAVE A LUNG INFECTION.

748
00:21:23,082 --> 00:21:25,051
JUST SOME KIND OF--SHE'S GONNA

749
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:26,118
BE FINE, BUT THEY'RE GONNA

750
00:21:26,118 --> 00:21:27,253
PROBABLY KEEP HER

751
00:21:27,253 --> 00:21:31,057
FOR A FEW DAYS.

752
00:21:31,057 --> 00:21:33,059
MY CHEST HURTS.

753
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:37,163
>> MY FIRST NIGHT IN THE

754
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:38,431
HOSPITAL WAS THE SCARIEST

755
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:40,199
OF MY LIFE, BUT I WAS SO

756
00:21:40,199 --> 00:21:41,401
RELIEVED TO HEAR THAT AUDREY WAS

757
00:21:41,401 --> 00:21:42,435
GONNA BE OKAY.

758
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:43,470
>> SO WE'RE GONNA GO DOWN

759
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:45,572
AND SEE THE BABY IN THE NICU.

760
00:21:45,572 --> 00:21:46,706
>> I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE

761
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:48,441
HER HERE.

762
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:49,642
I CAN'T WAIT TO FINALLY SEE HER,

763
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,177
BUT I CAN'T BRING HER HOME YET,

764
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:52,278
BECAUSE THE DOCTORS WANT TO KEEP

765
00:21:52,278 --> 00:21:53,680
HER AT THE HOSPITAL FOR A COUPLE

766
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,548
OF DAYS, JUST TO BE SAFE.

767
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:56,583
>> ARE YOU REALLY UPSET,

768
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:57,316
SABRINA?

769
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,351
>> YEAH.

770
00:21:58,351 --> 00:21:59,452
>> WELL, AT LEAST WE KNOW SHE'S

771
00:21:59,452 --> 00:22:01,888
HEALTHY NOW.

772
00:22:01,888 --> 00:22:03,923
OKAY.

773
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:06,659
>> AUDREY.

774
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,495
MOM'S BABY.

775
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:10,497
>> HI, AUDREY.

776
00:22:10,497 --> 00:22:12,499
YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL.

777
00:22:12,499 --> 00:22:14,033
SHE WANTS TO WAKE UP, BUT SHE'S

778
00:22:14,033 --> 00:22:17,737
JUST SO TIRED.

779
00:22:17,737 --> 00:22:18,838
>> SO DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS

780
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,507
ABOUT GOING HOME?

781
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:23,576
>> NO.

782
00:22:23,576 --> 00:22:24,744
>> I KNOW IT'S HARD.

783
00:22:24,744 --> 00:22:25,512
I KNOW IT'S HARD.

784
00:22:25,512 --> 00:22:26,413
THERE'S NOTHING HARDER THAN

785
00:22:26,413 --> 00:22:27,514
LEAVING YOUR BABY.

786
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:29,382
IT'S OKAY, SABRINA.

787
00:22:29,382 --> 00:22:30,717
DO YOU HAVE PICTURES OF HER?

788
00:22:30,717 --> 00:22:31,818
YOU'VE GOT PICTURES ON YOUR

00:22:31,818 --> 00:22:33,886

790
00:22:33,886 --> 00:22:35,054
ALL RIGHT.

791
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:36,623
AND I HAVE YOUR NUMBER, SO I'LL

792
00:22:36,623 --> 00:22:38,625
CALL YOU IF ANYTHING HAPPENS.

00:22:44,664 --> 00:22:48,668
>> BYE, BEAUTIFUL GIRL.

[chime dings]

795
00:22:54,006 --> 00:22:54,941
>> LEAVING AUDREY AT THE

796
00:22:54,941 --> 00:22:57,309
HOSPITAL WAS REALLY HARD, BUT AT

797
00:22:57,309 --> 00:22:58,511
LEAST SHE'LL BE HOME BY THE TIME

798
00:22:58,511 --> 00:23:00,647
HER DAD ARRIVES NEXT WEEK.

799
00:23:00,647 --> 00:23:01,914
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

800
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:05,117
>> I'M GONNA SKYPE IMAN.

>> OH, HI.

804
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:11,023
>> I THOUGHT I WAS SUPPOSED TO

805
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:12,324
BE TALKING TO YOU, NOT HER.

806
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:13,826
>> I DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

807
00:23:13,826 --> 00:23:15,562
>> HOW'S THE BABY?

808
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:17,864
>> SHE'S FINE.

809
00:23:17,864 --> 00:23:19,198

>> NO.

812
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,870
LIKE, SHE ATE TWO TIMES TODAY,

813
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:24,871
AND THAT'S IT.

814
00:23:24,871 --> 00:23:25,905
>> HOW ARE YOU?

815
00:23:25,905 --> 00:23:27,039

816
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,475
ARE YOU EXCITED TO SEE THE BABY

817
00:23:28,475 --> 00:23:29,175
OR WHAT?

818
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:30,510
>> YES, I AM, ACTUALLY.

819
00:23:30,510 --> 00:23:31,478
I'M VERY EXCITED.

MOST LIKELY THURSDAY--

823
00:23:36,215 --> 00:23:37,149
MOST LIKELY THURSDAY.

824
00:23:37,149 --> 00:23:39,318
>> WHY, "OR FRIDAY"?

825
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:40,252
>> JUST IN CASE I CAN'T GET

826
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:42,622
A TICKET OR ANYTHING.

>> I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO HIM.

834
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:06,445
HE'S BEEN SAYING THAT HE HAD

835
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,180
HIS TICKET.

836
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,049
HE TOLD ME THURSDAY, SO I TOLD

837
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:12,485
EVERYBODY ELSE THURSDAY.

838

>> YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

839
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:22,695
HE LIED?

840
00:24:22,695 --> 00:24:23,462
>> YEAH.

841
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:24,864
AND HE WAS JUST LIKE, "OH, WELL,

842
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:25,698
I DIDN'T EVEN GET MY TICKET

843
00:24:25,698 --> 00:24:26,933
YET," SO I DON'T EVEN THINK

844
00:24:26,933 --> 00:24:27,834
HE'S GOING TO GET IT.

845
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:29,869
>> I'M UPSET.

848
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:34,574
BABY, HIS BEAUTIFUL BABY.

849
00:24:34,574 --> 00:24:38,310
WHY IN THE HELL DID HE KEEP IT

850
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,747
FOR THE LAST SECOND, KNOWING

851
00:24:40,747 --> 00:24:42,314
THAT HE WAS HAVING A BABY?

852
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,716
I DON'T WANT YOU TO HURT, BUT

853
00:24:43,716 --> 00:24:45,451
WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE IT EASIER

854
00:24:45,451 --> 00:24:46,485
IS AUDREY.

855
00:24:46,485 --> 00:24:48,821
AND YOU THINK MAYBE NOT, BECAUSE

856
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:50,156
IT'S GOING TO REMIND YOU OF HIM,

857
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:51,457
BUT, NO, BECAUSE YOU'LL BE SO

858
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:53,225
BUSY TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF HER

859
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:55,094
THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE

860
00:24:55,094 --> 00:24:58,097
TIME TO DWELL OVER HIM.

861
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:02,468
I THINK THIS WOULD BE A GOOD

862
00:25:02,468 --> 00:25:04,470
CHANCE TO START CLEAN.

864
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:21,954

TAKE AUDREY HOME.

TO WELCOME HER.

872
00:25:30,396 --> 00:25:31,698
IT LOOKS LIKE I BETTER GET USED

873
00:25:31,698 --> 00:25:33,465
TO DOING THINGS ON MY OWN.

874
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:34,400
I'M KIND OF SCARED TO GO IN,

00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,850
>> IT'S, LIKE, WEIRD TO SEE YOU

1121
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:15,754
EVEN HERE TODAY.

1122
00:34:15,754 --> 00:34:17,689
>> COME AND EAT.

1123
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:19,291
>> IMAN TOTALLY CAUGHT ME OFF

1124
00:34:19,291 --> 00:34:20,792
GUARD BY SHOWING UP, BUT HIS

1125
00:34:20,792 --> 00:34:22,228
TIMING IS PERFECT.

1126
00:34:22,228 --> 00:34:23,061
I'M GOING BACK TO SCHOOL

1127
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:24,396
TOMORROW, AND SINCE THERE'S NO

1128
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:26,098
ROOM AT THE DAY CARE ON CAMPUS,

1129
00:34:26,098 --> 00:34:28,200
I WAS RELYING ON MY GRANDPARENTS

1130
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,468
TO WATCH AUDREY ALL DAY, SO

1131
00:34:29,468 --> 00:34:31,470
THEY'RE HAPPY HE'S HERE TOO.

1132
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:32,804
>> I'M REALLY SURPRISED THAT YOU

1133
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:34,606
GOT HERE, SO...

1134
00:34:34,606 --> 00:34:35,974
THIS REALLY IS A BIG SURPRISE

1135
00:34:35,974 --> 00:34:36,675
TO US.

1136
00:34:36,675 --> 00:34:38,043
WELL, I HEARD THAT HE'S

1137
00:34:38,043 --> 00:34:38,910
GONNA STAY.

1138
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,711
IS THAT TRUE?

1139
00:34:39,711 --> 00:34:40,646
ARE YOU GONNA STAY NOW?

1140
00:34:40,646 --> 00:34:41,480
>> I'M HERE INDEFINITELY,

1141
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,148
FOR RIGHT NOW.

1142
00:34:42,148 --> 00:34:43,014
THAT'S WHY I BOUGHT A ONE-WAY

1143
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:43,649
TICKET HERE.

1144
00:34:43,649 --> 00:34:44,350
>> OH, THAT'S GOOD.

1145
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,318
>> SO I'M KIND OF HERE FOR GOOD.

1146
00:34:47,853 --> 00:34:48,587
>> WHATEVER.

1147
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:49,921
IF IT PAYS--YOU KNOW, IF IT PAYS

1148
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:51,022
AN HOURLY WAGE CONSISTENTLY,

1149
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:51,757
I'LL DO IT.

1150
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:53,292
I DON'T WANT TO JUST BE HERE

1151
00:34:53,292 --> 00:34:54,360
AND JUST BE DEAD WEIGHT.

1152
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,294
I WANT TO BE HERE AND TRY TO

1153
00:34:55,294 --> 00:34:56,328
BE PRODUCTIVE.

1154
00:34:56,328 --> 00:34:57,496
LIKE, THE MAIN THING IS, I WANT

1155
00:34:57,496 --> 00:34:58,264
HER TO FINISH SCHOOL.

1156
00:34:58,264 --> 00:35:00,031
THAT'S WHAT I'M REALLY PUSHING.

1157
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:01,833
>> THAT'S IT.

1158
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,068
>> I'LL BEND OVER BACKWARDS TO

1159
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:04,102
MAKE SURE SHE GETS HER STUFF

1160
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:05,737
DONE, YOU KNOW?

1161
00:35:05,737 --> 00:35:07,239
>> I THINK IMAN MADE A GOOD

1162
00:35:07,239 --> 00:35:08,974
IMPRESSION WITH MY GRANDPARENTS,

1163
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:10,108
BUT REBECCA DIDN'T SEEM

1164
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,543
THRILLED.

1165
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:13,345
I WAS SO EXCITED FOR OUR FIRST

1166
00:35:13,345 --> 00:35:14,946
DAY OF SCHOOL TOGETHER, BUT THE

1167
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:16,315
NEXT MORNING, SHE SAID SHE

1168
00:35:16,315 --> 00:35:17,316
DIDN'T FEEL GOOD AND WAS

1169
00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:18,950
STAYING HOME.

1170
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,419
BEING IN SCHOOL AGAIN WAS

1171
00:35:20,419 --> 00:35:21,687
REALLY WEIRD.

1172
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:23,689
I WAS DEAD TIRED, DIDN'T KNOW

1173
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:25,191
MY WAY AROUND, AND DIDN'T KNOW

1174
00:35:25,191 --> 00:35:26,925
ANYBODY IN MY CLASSES.

1175
00:35:26,925 --> 00:35:27,926
AND BECAUSE REBECCA STAYED

1176
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:29,695
AT HOME, I DIDN'T HAVE ANYONE

1177
00:35:29,695 --> 00:35:31,297
TO EAT LUNCH WITH.

1178
00:35:31,297 --> 00:35:32,698
I COULD BARELY WAIT FOR IMAN AND

1179
00:35:32,698 --> 00:35:34,300
AUDREY TO COME PICK ME UP, BUT

1180
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,202
THEN MY DAY JUST GOT WORSE.

1181
00:35:36,202 --> 00:35:37,503
>> REBECCA DIDN'T GO TO SCHOOL

1182
00:35:37,503 --> 00:35:39,671
TODAY.

1183
00:35:39,671 --> 00:35:40,672
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS

1184
00:35:40,672 --> 00:35:41,573
OR IF THEY'RE LYING TO YOU, BUT

1185
00:35:41,573 --> 00:35:42,941
I GOT SOME OTHER NEWS FOR YOU.

1186
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:44,009
>> WHAT?

1187
00:35:44,009 --> 00:35:47,246
>> SHE UNENROLLED TODAY.

1188
00:35:47,246 --> 00:35:48,380
SHE UNENROLLED

1189
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:49,181
FROM SCHOOL TODAY.

1190
00:35:49,181 --> 00:35:49,848
>> TODAY?

1191
00:35:49,848 --> 00:35:51,149
>> TODAY.

1192
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,551
>> OH, MY GOD.

1193
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:53,885
>> SHE TOLD ME THAT SHE'S MOVING

1194
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:55,887
OUT TO LIVE WITH HER MOM.

1195
00:35:59,791 --> 00:36:01,493
YOU OKAY?

1196
00:36:01,493 --> 00:36:03,495
YOU GONNA MISS YOUR SISTER?

1197
00:36:07,433 --> 00:36:08,300
YOU ALL RIGHT, BABY?

1198
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,201
YOU WANT TO CALL YOUR MOM

1199
00:36:09,201 --> 00:36:10,001
OR YOUR SISTER OR ANYTHING

1200
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:10,669
LIKE THAT?

1201
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:11,337
>> NO.

1202
00:36:11,337 --> 00:36:12,304
>> WHY NOT?

1203
00:36:12,304 --> 00:36:14,806
>> I DON'T WANT TO TALK TO THEM.

1204
00:36:14,806 --> 00:36:16,041
>> SO NOBODY TOLD YOU NOTHING,

1205
00:36:16,041 --> 00:36:17,443
OBVIOUSLY.

1206
00:36:17,443 --> 00:36:19,878
YEAH, THAT'S PRETTY MESSED UP.

1207
00:36:19,878 --> 00:36:21,580
>> [crying]

1208
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,582
>> YOU WANT ME TO TAKE HER?

1209
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:30,856
>> MY MOM AND REBECCA KEPT

1210
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:32,258
CALLING ME TO TALK, BUT I

1211
00:36:32,258 --> 00:36:34,293
WOULDN'T PICK UP.

1212
00:36:38,564 --> 00:36:41,567
[crying]

1213
00:36:47,005 --> 00:36:49,007
>> WE LOVE YOU VERY MUCH.

1214
00:36:57,516 --> 00:36:58,484
>> I DIDN'T.

1215
00:36:58,484 --> 00:36:59,785
WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

1216
00:36:59,785 --> 00:37:00,986
YOU THINK WE JUST DID THIS

1217
00:37:00,986 --> 00:37:02,988
BEHIND YOUR BACK OR SOMETHING?

1218
00:37:16,502 --> 00:37:18,203
AND I DO ALL THIS STUFF FOR HER,

1219
00:37:18,203 --> 00:37:21,273
AND SHE JUST LEAVES ME.

1220
00:37:21,273 --> 00:37:24,910
JUST GET OUT, PLEASE!

1221
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:27,913
[crying]

1222
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,092
>> female announcer: DON'T

1223
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:41,693
GO AWAY.

1224
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:42,594
THIS EPISODE OF 16 AND PREGNANT 

1225
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:44,596
CONTINUES RIGHT NOW.

1226
00:37:46,898 --> 00:37:48,066
[baby crying]

1227
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:49,735
>> ARE YOU AWAKE?

1228
00:37:49,735 --> 00:37:51,102
I DIDN'T GET MUCH SLEEP

1229
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:51,837
LAST NIGHT.

1230
00:37:51,837 --> 00:37:53,339
AUDREY WAS UP A LOT, AND I SPENT

1231
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:54,740
MOST OF MY TIME THINKING ABOUT

1232
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,475
WHAT HAPPENED WITH MY SISTER.

1233
00:37:56,475 --> 00:37:58,043
I'M HAPPY IMAN IS HERE, BUT I'M

1234
00:37:58,043 --> 00:37:59,511
USED TO DEPENDING ON REBECCA FOR

1235
00:37:59,511 --> 00:38:01,580
SO MANY THINGS, AND I'M WORRIED

1236
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,714
ABOUT WHAT IT'S GONNA BE LIKE

1237
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:03,915
NOW THAT SHE'S GONE.

1238
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:04,583
I DON'T KNOW.

1239
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:06,652
I JUST FEEL HURT THAT I HAD TO

1240
00:38:06,652 --> 00:38:07,719
HEAR IT FROM IMAN AND NOT,

1241
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:09,588
LIKE, YOU OR IMAN OR ANYBODY.

1242
00:38:09,588 --> 00:38:11,590
>> I PLANNED ON TELLING YOU.

1243
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,527
>> LIKE, I WENT TO SCHOOL, AND I

1244
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:16,762
COME HOME, AND IT'S LIKE YOU'RE

1245
00:38:16,762 --> 00:38:18,464
MOVING OUT, ALREADY GONE.

1246
00:38:18,464 --> 00:38:19,998
WHEN DID YOU DECIDE THAT YOU

1247
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:20,999
WERE GOING TO MOVE OUT?

1248
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:21,767
LIKE, YOU ALREADY HAD IT

1249
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:22,434
PLANNED?

1250
00:38:22,434 --> 00:38:24,436
OR WAS IT JUST, LIKE...

1251
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,477
>> HMM.

1252
00:38:31,477 --> 00:38:32,944
I WANT TO BE WITH MOM TOO,

1253
00:38:32,944 --> 00:38:35,180
BUT I JUST CAN'T NOW, BECAUSE

1254
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,682
OF IMAN AND THE BABY AND

1255
00:38:36,682 --> 00:38:38,884
EVERYTHING, SO...

1256
00:38:38,884 --> 00:38:40,819
YOU WERE JUST, LIKE, MY CLOSEST

1257
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:44,956
FRIEND AND EVERYTHING.

1258
00:38:44,956 --> 00:38:46,925
NOW THAT MY SISTER LEFT, I FEEL

1259
00:38:46,925 --> 00:38:49,461
LIKE WE'RE NOT AS CLOSE AS WE

1260
00:38:49,461 --> 00:38:50,462
WERE BEFORE.

1261
00:38:50,462 --> 00:38:52,330
IT'S KIND OF SAD, BECAUSE I

1262
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,565
STILL THOUGHT ME AND HER WOULD

1263
00:38:53,565 --> 00:38:56,001
BE BEST FRIENDS AND REALLY CLOSE

1264
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:57,536
AND TELL EACH OTHER EVERYTHING,

1265
00:38:57,536 --> 00:38:59,938
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE THAT ANYMORE.

1266
00:38:59,938 --> 00:39:01,973
>> I KNOW YOU GUYS WERE, LIKE,

1267
00:39:01,973 --> 00:39:04,009
SUPER CLOSE, BEST FRIENDS.

1268
00:39:04,009 --> 00:39:05,744
AND NOW SHE'S, LIKE, GONE.

1269
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:06,945
LIKE, I WOULD WANT TO CRY.

1270
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:08,647
>> YEAH, I CRIED, LIKE, THAT

1271
00:39:08,647 --> 00:39:10,916
WHOLE NIGHT.

1272
00:39:10,916 --> 00:39:12,183
MAYBE IT WAS, LIKE, EVERYTHING

1273
00:39:12,183 --> 00:39:14,085
ALTOGETHER, AND THEN PLUS IMAN

1274
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:15,220
WAS COMING OUT.

1275
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,588
SHE PROBABLY DIDN'T BELIEVE

1276
00:39:16,588 --> 00:39:18,457
HE WAS GONNA COME OUT, AND THEN

1277
00:39:18,457 --> 00:39:22,260
HE CAME, AND SHE WAS LIKE, "OH."

1278
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:24,362
>> READY TO TAKE A BATH?

1279
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:28,667
>> I THINK IMAN'S A GREAT DAD.

1280
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:30,969
HE'S TAKING CARE OF HER ALL DAY,

1281
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:34,172
ALL NIGHT.

1282
00:39:34,172 --> 00:39:35,474
HE KNOWS HER CRIES.

1283
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:37,042
HE KNOWS WHEN TO FEED HER,

1284
00:39:37,042 --> 00:39:38,577
WHEN TO JUST HOLD HER,

1285
00:39:38,577 --> 00:39:39,511
WHEN TO BURP HER,

1286
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:40,746
WHEN TO CHANGE HER.

1287
00:39:40,746 --> 00:39:42,147
>> YOU ACTUALLY LIKE ME BEING

1288
00:39:42,147 --> 00:39:43,114
HERE, HELPING YOU OUT?

1289
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:43,782
>> YES.

1290
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:44,850
>> YEAH?

1291
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:45,751
ARE YOU SURE?

1292
00:39:45,751 --> 00:39:46,752
YOU'RE NOT LYING TO ME?

1293
00:39:46,752 --> 00:39:47,419
>> NO.

1294
00:39:47,419 --> 00:39:48,086
>> ALL RIGHT.

1295
00:39:48,086 --> 00:39:48,754
IT'S A TOUGH JOB.

1296
00:39:48,754 --> 00:39:50,422
IT'S A VERY TOUGH JOB, ACTUALLY.

1297
00:39:50,422 --> 00:39:52,624
>> I KNOW.

1298
00:39:52,624 --> 00:39:54,626
ARE YOU GOING CRAZY?

1299
00:39:54,626 --> 00:39:56,962
NOW THAT I'M A MOM, IT'S A LOT

1300
00:39:56,962 --> 00:39:58,530
OF RESPONSIBILITY AND HARD WORK

1301
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,331
THAT I HAVE TO DO, AND IT'S JUST

1302
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:01,867
STRESSFUL SOMETIMES, BECAUSE

1303
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:03,101
WHEN SHE'S CRYING, AND YOU DON'T

1304
00:40:03,101 --> 00:40:05,003
KNOW WHY SHE'S CRYING...

1305
00:40:05,003 --> 00:40:06,738
WHAT'S WRONG?

1306
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:07,739
IT'S KIND OF HARD.

1307
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,340
WELL, IT IS HARD.

1308
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,909
AND IT'S STRESSFUL TRYING TO

1309
00:40:10,909 --> 00:40:12,811
GRADUATE ON TIME.

1310
00:40:12,811 --> 00:40:14,713
I'M HOPING AFTER I GRADUATE HIGH

1311
00:40:14,713 --> 00:40:17,148
SCHOOL, THAT I'M GOING TO GO TO

1312
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:19,217
COSMETOLOGY SCHOOL, AND IMAN'S

1313
00:40:19,217 --> 00:40:20,385
GOING TO BE IN SCHOOL BY THEN

1314
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:22,320
AND HAVE HIS JOB.

1315
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,221
>> HE HAS TO WORK.

1316
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:24,355
HE'S GOT A BABY.

1317
00:40:24,355 --> 00:40:26,357
HE'S GOT RESPONSIBILITY NOW.

1318
00:40:26,357 --> 00:40:27,626
HE CAN'T AFFORD TO STAY HOME

1319
00:40:27,626 --> 00:40:28,660
BABYSITTING ANYMORE.

1320
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,628
HE CAN'T JUST SIT AROUND AND

1321
00:40:29,628 --> 00:40:31,029
WAIT FOR JOBS TO CALL HIM.

1322
00:40:31,029 --> 00:40:33,131
>> LIKE, IF I COULD GO BACK AND

1323
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:34,566
STUFF, I WOULD JUST WAIT TO HAVE

1324
00:40:34,566 --> 00:40:36,935
SEX UNTIL I WAS OLDER AND JUST

1325
00:40:36,935 --> 00:40:39,771
MATURE ENOUGH, BECAUSE THEN YOU

1326
00:40:39,771 --> 00:40:42,908
END UP WITH HEADACHES EVERY DAY,

1327
00:40:42,908 --> 00:40:45,076
NOT SLEEPING, JUST A LOT OF

1328
00:40:45,076 --> 00:40:46,578
GROWING UP AND RESPONSIBILITY

1329
00:40:46,578 --> 00:40:48,113
THAT YOU DON'T WANT UNTIL

1330
00:40:48,113 --> 00:40:50,281
LATER ON, AND IT'S JUST

1331
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,182
REALLY HARD.

1332
00:40:51,182 --> 00:40:52,851
BUT, IN THE END, LIKE, ME AND

1333
00:40:52,851 --> 00:40:53,719
IMAN ARE HAPPY.

1334
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:55,621
AND THE BABY'S ALWAYS HAPPY,

1335
00:40:55,621 --> 00:40:57,288
NO MATTER WHAT, SO THAT'S ALL

1336
00:40:57,288 --> 00:40:57,956
THAT MATTERS.

1337
00:40:57,956 --> 00:40:59,958
[chime dings]

1338
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:15,907
>> PEOPLE ALWAYS STARE AT ME

1339
00:41:15,907 --> 00:41:16,942
LIKE THEY'VE NEVER SEEN

1340
00:41:16,942 --> 00:41:18,143
A PREGNANT PERSON BEFORE.

1341
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:19,511
>> I'LL HELP AS MUCH AS I CAN,

1342
00:41:19,511 --> 00:41:20,846
DEVON, BUT I'M NOT GONNA RAISE

1343
00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:22,313
THIS CHILD.

1344
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,650
[baby crying]

1345
00:41:24,650 --> 00:41:25,684
>> IT SUCKS TO MOVE AWAY FROM

1346
00:41:25,684 --> 00:41:26,417
YOUR FAMILY.

1347
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,520
YOU DO WHAT YOU GOT TO DO.

1348
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,287
>> I JUST DON'T WANT YOU

1349
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:31,289
TO GO AWAY.
