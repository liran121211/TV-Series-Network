SO WHAT MADE YOU WANT TO KEEP

192
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:37,845
YOUR BABY?

193
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:38,746
>> DECIDE NOT TO GIVE IT UP

194
00:04:38,746 --> 00:04:39,212
FOR ADOPTION?

195
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,213
>> YEAH.

196
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:42,149
LIKE, DID YOU THINK ABOUT THAT?

197
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:42,950
>> NOT REALLY.

198
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:43,884
AND, LIKE, ABORTION,

199
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:46,186
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I'M FOR.

200
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:47,020
DO YOU THINK I'M READY TO BE

201
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:47,721
A MOM?

202
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:49,022
>> OF COURSE.

203
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,023
>> DO YOU THINK SKYLAR'S READY

204
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:50,991
TO BE A DADDY?

205
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:52,660
>> NO.

206
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,661
>> WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?

207
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:54,127
>> I'M SORRY.

208
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:56,096
OKAY, I THINK, LIKE,

209
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:58,098
ONCE A GIRL GETS PREGNANT,

210
00:04:58,098 --> 00:04:59,767
YOU KNOW, SHE'S USUALLY THE ONE

211
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:00,801
WHO MATURES RIGHT AWAY

212
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:01,702
BUT NOT THE GUY.

213
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:03,437
>> YEAH.

214
00:05:03,437 --> 00:05:05,072
BUT I ACTUALLY THINK SKYLAR'S

215
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:06,306
MATURING PRETTY QUICK.

216
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,007
HE EVEN CAME WITH ME TO MY

217
00:05:07,007 --> 00:05:08,942
ULTRASOUND SO WE COULD FIND OUT

218
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:10,411
THE SEX OF OUR BABY.

219
00:05:10,411 --> 00:05:11,311
WE'RE HAVING A GIRL

220
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:13,714
AND ARE NAMING HER SUMMER.

221
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:18,386
NOW THAT WE KNOW THE GENDER,

222
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:19,052
WE CAN GO AHEAD AND FINISH

223
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:19,753
THE NURSERY.

224
00:05:19,753 --> 00:05:21,689
HOW HARD CAN PUTTING A CRIB

225
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,857
TOGETHER BE ANYWAY?

226
00:05:23,857 --> 00:05:26,093
>> HMM.

227
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:26,794
IS THERE A SPECIFIC SIDE

228
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:28,862
I NEED TO PUT?

229
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:30,330
WHY DOES THAT LOOK WRONG?

230
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,065
I DON'T GET THAT PART.

231
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:32,966
SEE, THAT DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT

232
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:33,767
TO ME.

233
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:35,335
SOMEHOW I KNEW US PUTTING THE

234
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:36,804
CRIB TOGETHER WOULD TURN INTO

235
00:05:36,804 --> 00:05:38,171
ME PUTTING THE CRIB TOGETHER.

236
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,507
>> [laughs]

237
00:05:39,507 --> 00:05:40,741
UM, TEAMWORK.

238
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:41,475
YOU PUT IT TOGETHER, AND THEN

239
00:05:41,475 --> 00:05:42,810
I GIVE YOU THE BABY TO PUT

240
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:45,112
IN IT.

241
00:05:45,112 --> 00:05:46,046
>> SO ARE YOU AFRAID YOU'RE

242
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:46,914
GONNA HAVE TO GIVE UP ANYTHING?

243
00:05:46,914 --> 00:05:48,816
>> I'M NOT GONNA LET JUST

244
00:05:48,816 --> 00:05:50,317
HAVING A BABY STOP ME FROM

245
00:05:50,317 --> 00:05:51,485
DOING WHAT I WANT TO DO

246
00:05:51,485 --> 00:05:52,052
AND WHAT I LOVE.

247
00:05:52,052 --> 00:05:53,487
>> WELL, THAT'S GOOD,

248
00:05:53,487 --> 00:05:54,922
BECAUSE THEN IF YOU--

249
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:56,924
IF IT DID, I THINK YOU'D END UP

250
00:05:56,924 --> 00:05:58,759
BEING RESENTFUL OF ME AND

251
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:01,028
POSSIBLY SUMMER.

252
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:02,029
>> EVERYONE THINKS I'M GONNA

253
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:03,263
HAVE TO GIVE SOMETHING UP.

254
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,364
I'M SURE I CAN STILL PLAY

255
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,065
IN THE VIRGINIA ORCHESTRA

256
00:06:05,065 --> 00:06:06,834
AND BE A MOM.

257
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:18,011
>> NOW THAT THE CRIB IS DONE,

258
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:19,012
IT'S TIME TO START PLANNING

259
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:20,981
FOR OUR FUTURE.

260
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:21,815
>> OH, THAT'S PRETTY SWEET

261
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:22,249
RIGHT THERE.

262
00:06:22,249 --> 00:06:23,651
>> WE NEED A TINY BABY PUMPKIN.

263
00:06:23,651 --> 00:06:24,384
>> WHAT ABOUT THAT ONE?

264
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:25,118
>> LIKE THAT ONE.

265
00:06:25,118 --> 00:06:25,786
>> THAT ONE?

266
00:06:25,786 --> 00:06:26,454
>> SINCE SKYLAR ONLY WORKS

267
00:06:26,454 --> 00:06:27,855
PART-TIME AT THE THRIFT STORE,

268
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:28,989
WE'RE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

269
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,090
HOW TO AFFORD A BABY.

270
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:30,891
THAT'S GONNA BE US IN,

271
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:31,725
LIKE, A YEAR.

272
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:32,225
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

273
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:32,826
>> SHE'S SO CUTE.

[giggles]

275
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:37,130
SO WHERE DO YOU WANT US TO BE

276
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,099
WITH OUR BABY NEXT YEAR?

277
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:39,767
>> I DON'T KNOW.

278
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:40,734
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

279
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:41,401
>> I WISH WE HAD A PLACE

280
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,437
OF OUR OWN TO GO TO.

281
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:44,705
>> YEAH.

282
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:45,873
I CAN'T REALLY AFFORD THAT

283
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:47,074
RIGHT NOW, THOUGH.

284
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:48,208
>> I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT THE

285
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,209
MONEY, SINCE YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE

286
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:51,044
WHO'S WORKING.

287
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:51,712
>> I THINK--

>> WE'RE GONNA BE AT MY PARENT''

>> YEAH, AT LEAST TWO YEARS.

291
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,151
>> SUCH A LONG TIME.

292
00:06:58,151 --> 00:07:00,488
>> YEAH.

293

TWO YEARS OF LIVING AT MY MOM'S

297
00:07:05,392 --> 00:07:06,727
HOUSE IS NOT EXACTLY THE PLAN

298
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:07,961
I WAS THINKING OF.

AT A YOUNG AGE, I'M TRYING HARD

303
00:07:14,401 --> 00:07:15,068
NOT TO GIVE ANYTHING UP.

304
00:07:15,068 --> 00:07:17,004
ONE THING I REFUSE TO CHANGE

305
00:07:17,004 --> 00:07:19,372
ABOUT MY LIFE IS PLAYING MUSIC.

309
00:07:23,343 --> 00:07:26,113

>> THAT'S RIGHT.

568
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,558
>> * COMING DOWN

>> * REACHING OUT

580
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:02,009
* TO TELL YOU SOMETHING

581
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:03,143
>> OH, YEAH, WHAT DID YOU THINK

582
00:14:03,143 --> 00:14:05,112
WHEN YOU FIRST PICKED ME UP?

583
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:05,778
>> I LIKED YOUR EYEBROW

584
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:06,513
PIERCING.

585
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:06,947
I KNEW THAT.

586
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:07,647
AND I THOUGHT YOU WERE CUTE

587
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:09,449

592
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:17,724
"WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE COLOR?

593
00:14:17,724 --> 00:14:19,159
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE MOVIE?"

594
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,961
>> [clears throat]

595
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:24,664

>> YOU CAN'T?

628
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:21,721
>> WELL, I GUESS I CAN,

629
00:15:21,721 --> 00:15:23,223
BUT STILL, IT'S KIND OF

630
00:15:23,223 --> 00:15:24,224
UNEXPECTED.

631
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:25,925
>> LIKE, PERSONALLY, I WOULDN'T

632
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,094
WANT TO BE PREGNANT.

633
00:15:27,094 --> 00:15:28,195
>> NOT MUCH YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT,

634
00:15:28,195 --> 00:15:29,229
SO YOU MIGHT AS WELL MAKE

635
00:15:29,229 --> 00:15:29,896
THE BEST OF IT, RIGHT?

636
00:15:29,896 --> 00:15:30,763
>> EXACTLY.

637
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,233
THAT'S HOW I LOOK AT LIFE NOW.

638
00:15:33,233 --> 00:15:34,134
>> I'M GLAD EVERYTHING'S, LIKE,

639
00:15:34,134 --> 00:15:35,735
WORKING OUT.

640
00:15:35,735 --> 00:15:36,436
LIKE, IT COULD HAVE GONE IN

641
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,238
AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND BEEN

642
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:40,407
REALLY BAD AND JUST A MESS.

643
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:41,241
AND I'M REALLY GLAD, LIKE,

644
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:42,275
YOU'RE HAPPY.

00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:43,243
>> YOU HAVE A LOT OF SUPPORT.

00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:47,847
GONNA GO GOOD, SINCE I FOUND--

650
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:49,016
OR I HAVE, LIKE, THE PERFECT

651
00:15:49,016 --> 00:15:51,184
BOYFRIEND AND THE PERFECT RING

652
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:53,353
AND THE PERFECT FAMILY,

653
00:15:53,353 --> 00:15:54,354
AND I DON'T KNOW.

654
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:55,188
I'M EXCITED ABOUT HAVING

655
00:15:55,188 --> 00:15:55,822
A PERFECT BABY.

656
00:15:55,822 --> 00:15:57,324
Y'ALL ARE ALL GONNA BE

657
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:58,191
AT MY WEDDING, RIGHT?

658
00:15:58,191 --> 00:15:58,858
>> YES.

659
00:15:58,858 --> 00:15:59,692
>> YEAH.

660
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:00,427
>> SO HOW ARE YOU TAKING THIS

661
00:16:00,427 --> 00:16:02,229
SO WELL?

662
00:16:02,229 --> 00:16:03,196
>> I HAVE THE SUPPORT

663
00:16:03,196 --> 00:16:05,165
FROM Y'ALL AND HIS FAMILY

664
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:06,366
AND MY FAMILY, AND I KNOW

665
00:16:06,366 --> 00:16:08,035
THAT WE CAN DO IT.

666
00:16:08,035 --> 00:16:08,868
>> IT'S GOOD THAT YOUR PARENTS

667
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:09,436
SUPPORT YOU, THOUGH,

668
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:10,370
'CAUSE I KNOW MINE WOULDN'T.

669
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,038
>> YEAH.

670
00:16:11,038 --> 00:16:11,704
[laughter]

671
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:12,972
>> YEAH, YEAH.

672
00:16:12,972 --> 00:16:14,474
>> MY FRIENDS ARE SO EXCITED

673
00:16:14,474 --> 00:16:16,243
ABOUT THE ENGAGEMENT.

674
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:17,210
WISH I COULD SAY THE SAME

675
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,378
FOR MY DAD.

676
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:19,079
>> AND JUST THE FACT THAT

677
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:20,247
YOU HAVE A BABY DOESN'T MEAN

678
00:16:20,247 --> 00:16:20,913
YOU HAVE TO BE MARRIED.

679
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:22,349
>> IT'S NOT WHY I WAS

680
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:23,750
GONNA BE MARRIED.

681
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,484
>> YOU DON'T NEED TO RUSH

682
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,418
INTO IT.

683
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:26,253
>> WHEN DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD

684
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:27,987
GET HITCHED, THEN?

685
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:28,821
>> I THINK YOU SHOULD WAIT

686
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,357
TILL IT'S RIGHT.

687
00:16:30,357 --> 00:16:31,258
BUT YOU BOTH NEED TO GET THROUGH

688
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:32,125
WITH YOUR SCHOOL.

689
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:32,859
>> WHAT IF IT WAS RIGHT

690
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:33,860
RIGHT NOW?

691
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,395
>> WELL, THAT'S THE PROBLEM IS,

692
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:36,896
IT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

693
00:16:36,896 --> 00:16:37,730
WHEN IT'S RIGHT AND WHEN

694
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:39,032
YOU THINK IT'S RIGHT.

695
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:39,999
I'M NOT SAYING YOU SHOULD GET

696
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:40,800
MARRIED WHEN YOU THINK IT'S

697
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,501
RIGHT.

698
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:42,269
>> I THINK IT'D BE RIGHT

699
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:43,070
WHENEVER WE DID IT.

700
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,037
>> WELL...

701
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:45,038
>> THERE IS NO WRONG TIME

702
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:46,473
FOR LOVE.

703
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:47,807
I UNDERSTAND WHAT MY DAD'S

704
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,209
SAYING, BUT I'M NOT GONNA LET IT

705
00:16:49,209 --> 00:16:51,244
GET IN THE WAY OF WHAT I WANT.

706
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:00,087
>> I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE

707
00:17:00,087 --> 00:17:01,088
WEARING AN ENGAGEMENT RING

708
00:17:01,088 --> 00:17:02,089
AT 17.

709
00:17:02,089 --> 00:17:03,123
I FIGURED IT WOULD JUST BE

710
00:17:03,123 --> 00:17:04,124
MY BELLY RING.

711
00:17:04,124 --> 00:17:04,824
YAY.

712
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:07,094
BUT NOW EVEN THAT HAS TO CHANGE.

713
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:07,927
MA?

714
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:08,595
>> YEAH, HONEY?

715
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:09,196
>> MY BELLY RING CAME.

716
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:11,731
>> DID IT, REALLY?

717
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:14,267
>> I GOT A PINK ONE.

718
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:15,735
>> OF COURSE.

719
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:16,736
>> OH.

720
00:17:16,736 --> 00:17:17,737
>> THAT'S REALLY BIG.

721
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:19,038
>> OH, MY.

722
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,039
[laughs]

723
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,040
AND IT'S FLEXIBLE?

724
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:21,874
>> YEAH.

725
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:22,742
>> ISN'T THAT NEAT?

726
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:24,644
>> THAT'S CUTE.

727
00:17:24,644 --> 00:17:27,013
MY PALE WHITE BELLY.

728
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:34,654
OW.

729
00:17:34,654 --> 00:17:35,255
THAT WAS, LIKE, SHARP

730
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:37,257
AND POINTY AT THE TOP.

731
00:17:37,257 --> 00:17:39,392
THAT LOOKS REALLY BIZARRE.

732
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:40,026
>> THAT LOOKS HUGE.

733
00:17:40,026 --> 00:17:41,261
LOOKS LIKE A TOOTHPICK

734
00:17:41,261 --> 00:17:42,061
WITH PINK DOTS ON THE END.

735
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:42,762
>> YOU CAN FEEL IT THROUGH

736
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:43,430
THE SKIN.

737
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,097
>> REALLY?

738
00:17:44,097 --> 00:17:45,064
>> YAY.

739
00:17:45,064 --> 00:17:46,065
THAT'S A RELIEF.

740
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:50,002
>> WELL, GOOD.

741
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,138
>> NOW THAT SKYLAR AND I ARE

742
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:51,871
ENGAGED, I CAN START TO SEE US

743
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,040
AS REAL PARENTS.

744
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,074
WE GOT THREE WEEKS AND TWO DAYS

745
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:55,742
LEFT.

746
00:17:55,742 --> 00:17:56,109
>> YUP.

747
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:57,444
>> SO ARE YOU GETTING NERVOUS?

748
00:17:57,444 --> 00:17:59,112
>> YEAH.

749
00:17:59,112 --> 00:17:59,979
>> ABOUT WHAT?

750
00:17:59,979 --> 00:18:00,813
>> HAVING A BABY.

751
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:03,082
>> I MEAN, LIKE, THE LABOR PART

752
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,084
AND ACTUALLY HAVING IT

753
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:06,819
OR THE COMING HOME PART?

754
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:07,854
>> PROBABLY THE LABOR.

755
00:18:07,854 --> 00:18:09,489
>> THE LABOR?

756
00:18:09,489 --> 00:18:10,323
WHY ARE YOU NERVOUS

757
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:11,491
ABOUT THAT PART?

758
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:12,159
>> I DON'T KNOW.

759
00:18:12,159 --> 00:18:13,493
>> [giggles]

760
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:14,494
>> I DON'T WANT YOU TO DIE.

761
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:15,828
>> I HOPE I DON'T EITHER.

762
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,131
>> WHAT ARE YOU NERVOUS ABOUT?

763
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:19,299
>> I DON'T KNOW.

764
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:21,368
>> HER COMING OUT GROTESQUE?

765
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:22,369
>> SHE'S OUR DAUGHTER.

766
00:18:22,369 --> 00:18:23,336
SHE'S NOT GONNA BE EVEN

767
00:18:23,336 --> 00:18:25,104
GROTESQUE IN THE SLIGHTEST.

768
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:25,805
>> OKAY.

769
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:27,840
>> I HOPE SHE'S NOT LIKE ME

770
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,843
VERY MUCH, IN THE BAD WAYS.

771
00:18:30,843 --> 00:18:33,146
LIKE, MY MOM DIDN'T KNOW

772
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:34,046
ANYTHING I WAS DOING.

773
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:34,881
I HOPE I CAN KNOW WHAT

774
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:36,383
SHE'S DOING.

775
00:18:36,383 --> 00:18:37,317
AND I HOPE SHE'S NOT DUMB

776
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:38,918
AND DOES THAT STUFF.

777
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:43,456
>> I DON'T WANT THAT EITHER.

778
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,457
>> ENOUGH WORRYING ABOUT

779
00:18:44,457 --> 00:18:45,292
THE BABY.

780
00:18:45,292 --> 00:18:46,025
IT'S TIME TO CELEBRATE.

781
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:46,859
MY MOM IS THROWING ME

782
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:47,960
A BABY SHOWER TODAY

783
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,299
AT SKYLAR'S HOUSE.

784
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,133
>> OH, YES.

785
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,101
JUST WHAT I WANTED.

786
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:56,536
>> WOW, THAT'S--

787
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:58,205
>> CUTE.

788
00:18:58,205 --> 00:18:59,239
>> OH, SOCKS.

789
00:18:59,239 --> 00:19:00,307
>> SOCKS, ALL RIGHT.

790
00:19:00,307 --> 00:19:01,408
>> AW.

791
00:19:01,408 --> 00:19:02,975
>> IT'S A BABY BLANKET.

792
00:19:02,975 --> 00:19:05,178
>> AW, IT'S SO CUTE.

793
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:05,845
THANKS, Y'ALL.

794
00:19:05,845 --> 00:19:07,614
>> THANKS, EVERYBODY.

795
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:09,316
>> I LOVE HIS PICTURE.

796
00:19:09,316 --> 00:19:10,917
IT'S SO ADORABLE.

797
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:11,618
>> YES.

798
00:19:11,618 --> 00:19:12,519
>> DO YOU WANT THIS,

799
00:19:12,519 --> 00:19:14,020
OR DID YOU WANT SKYLAR'S FACE?

800
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,022
>> I'LL HAVE THE CORNER.

801
00:19:16,022 --> 00:19:17,624
>> I WANT LIZZIE'S FACE.

802
00:19:17,624 --> 00:19:19,158
SWEET.

803
00:19:19,158 --> 00:19:19,892
>> LOOK AT THAT PRETTY BABY

804
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:20,593
ON THE CAKE.

805
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:21,328
>> [growls]

806
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:23,162
>> [whines] SKYLAR!

807
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,163
YOU'RE MEAN.

808
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:25,865
>> [chuckles]

809
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:26,866
>> OH, KISS ME AFTER YOU,

810
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,868
LIKE, SMASH MY FACE.

811
00:19:28,868 --> 00:19:33,406
[laughter]

812
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:35,442
>> EVERYBODY COULD MOVE IN

813
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:38,177
THIS WAY, PLEASE.

814
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,046
>> ALL RIGHT, AS EVERYBODY

815
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:41,381
PROBABLY KNOWS, YOU KNOW,

816
00:19:41,381 --> 00:19:43,216
A FEW MONTHS AGO, AFTER LIZZIE

817
00:19:43,216 --> 00:19:44,551
GOT PREGNANT, SHE DECIDED THAT

818
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:46,919
SHE WASN'T GOING TO GO BACK

819
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:47,920
TO HIGH SCHOOL TO FINISH UP

820
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,988
HER LAST YEAR.

821
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:49,922
SHE DECIDED SHE WANTED TO DO

822
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:52,425
HOMESCHOOL, AND SHE WAS

823
00:19:52,425 --> 00:19:53,226
CONFIDENT THAT SHE COULD DO IT,

824
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:55,628
AND I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT

825
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:57,096
SHE DID.

826
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:58,265
SO SHE'S NOW GRADUATED

827
00:19:58,265 --> 00:19:59,499
FIVE MONTHS AHEAD OF THE REST

828
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:00,500
OF HER CLASS.

829
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,668
>> YAY.

830
00:20:01,668 --> 00:20:03,336
>> AND SO TODAY WE ARE GIVING

831
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:05,171
HER HER DIPLOMA.

832
00:20:05,171 --> 00:20:07,240
[cheers and applause]

833
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:07,707
>> THANK YOU.

834
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:08,575
>> THERE YOU GO.

835
00:20:08,575 --> 00:20:09,276
CONGRATULATIONS.

836
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:09,909
>> THERE YOU GO, KIDDO.

837
00:20:09,909 --> 00:20:10,677
>> THANK YOU.

838
00:20:10,677 --> 00:20:11,378
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

839
00:20:11,378 --> 00:20:12,211
DON'T YOU WANT TO GIVE A SPEECH?

840
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:13,045
YOU'RE THE VALEDICTORIAN

841
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,013
OF YOUR CLASS.

842
00:20:14,013 --> 00:20:15,047
[laughter]

843
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,617
>> THE BABY SHOWER WAS GREAT,

844
00:20:17,617 --> 00:20:19,018
BUT LATER THAT NIGHT, I GOT

845
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:20,520
SOME UNSETTLING NEWS.

846
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,654
WORD WAS GETTING AROUND THAT

847
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:23,490
SKYLAR HAD BEEN UNFAITHFUL TO ME

848
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:25,124
EIGHT MONTHS AGO AFTER PROM.

849
00:20:25,124 --> 00:20:26,058
>> * WAKE UP

850
00:20:26,058 --> 00:20:27,126
>> JOSH JUST TEXTED ME BACK,

851
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:28,060
AND HE SAID HE'S BEEN

852
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:30,029
HEARING [bleep] TOO.

853
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:32,031
>> LIKE WHAT?

854
00:20:32,031 --> 00:20:33,032
>> KRISTA AND SKYLAR,

855
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:38,070
SOUNDS LIKE THEY HOOKED UP.

856
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:38,771
I MEAN, SO SERIOUSLY, LIKE,

857
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:39,706
THINK ABOUT IT.

858
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:40,640
I MEAN, DO YOU--DO YOU THINK

859
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,775
SKYLAR WOULD CHEAT ON YOU?

860
00:20:42,775 --> 00:20:44,311
>> LIKE, I DON'T THINK HE WOULD

861
00:20:44,311 --> 00:20:45,478
'CAUSE WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER

862
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:46,646
FOR SO LONG, AND IF HE DID DO

863
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:47,414
ANYTHING BACK THEN, HE SHOULD

864
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,782
HAVE TOLD ME BY NOW.

865
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:52,118
>> I MEAN, WHAT IF HE DID?

866
00:20:52,118 --> 00:20:53,119
LIKE, WHAT ARE--

867
00:20:53,119 --> 00:20:54,454
I MEAN, ARE YOU GONNA EVER

868
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:57,123
TRUST HIM AGAIN?

869
00:20:57,123 --> 00:20:58,625
>> I CAN'T ANSWER THAT.

870
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:02,161
I DON'T KNOW.

871
00:21:02,161 --> 00:21:03,229
I ASSUMED IT WAS JUST

872
00:21:03,229 --> 00:21:04,397
AN UGLY RUMOR, BUT WHEN

873
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:06,265
I CONFRONTED SKYLAR ABOUT IT,

874
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:09,302
EVERYTHING CHANGED.

875
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,140
>> I MADE A MISTAKE A WHILE AGO.

876
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,643
>> WAS IT WITH KRISTA?

877
00:21:16,643 --> 00:21:18,645
>> YEAH.

878
00:21:18,645 --> 00:21:20,847
I DON'T WANT THAT TO RUIN

879
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:22,682
WHAT WE HAVE TOGETHER,

880
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:24,917
'CAUSE I KNOW I REALLY DON'T

881
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:26,285
WANT TO LOSE YOU.

882
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,687
>> DO YOUR OTHER FRIENDS KNOW?

883
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:28,388
>> YEAH.

884
00:21:28,388 --> 00:21:29,722
>> LIKE, ALL OF THEM?

885
00:21:29,722 --> 00:21:31,558
>> YEAH.

886
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:32,425
>> THAT JUST MAKES ME LOOK

887
00:21:32,425 --> 00:21:38,164
STUPID.

888
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:39,732
I DIDN'T EVER SEE YOU COMING

889
00:21:39,732 --> 00:21:40,299
AND DOING THAT.

890
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:44,270
AND I JUST FEEL STUPID.

891
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:45,405
>> WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T FEEL

892
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:47,239
STUPID, BUT I UNDERSTAND.

893
00:21:47,239 --> 00:21:48,875
>> IT MAKES ME FEEL

894
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,543
SELF-CONSCIOUS...

895
00:21:50,543 --> 00:21:51,544
>> HONEY, YOU SHOULDN'T.

896
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:53,312
>> LIKE IT'S MY FAULT

897
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,481
AND I DID SOMETHING WRONG...

898
00:21:54,481 --> 00:21:55,482
>> IT'S NOT.

899
00:21:55,482 --> 00:22:00,820
>> WHICH LED YOU TO DO THAT.

900
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:03,322
>> THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT.

901
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,824
>> I DON'T EVEN KNOW.

902
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:07,193
BUT YOU CAN HAVE YOUR RING BACK.

903
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:15,234
>> * I TORE YOUR HEART

904
00:22:15,234 --> 00:22:16,736
* TO PIECES

905
00:22:16,736 --> 00:22:19,906
>> I LOVE YOU.

906
00:22:19,906 --> 00:22:21,574
I'M PROBABLY GONNA GO HOME NOW,

907
00:22:21,574 --> 00:22:22,742
'CAUSE I'M SURE YOU DON'T WANT

908
00:22:22,742 --> 00:22:25,778
ME STAYING HERE.

909
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:33,252
>> * PLEASE FORGIVE ME

910
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:44,431
>> * DAYLIGHT TURNS TO DARK

911
00:22:44,431 --> 00:22:45,264
>> I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE

912
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:46,633
THE RUMORS WERE TRUE.

913
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:47,800
SKYLAR HAD BEEN UNFAITHFUL

914
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,170
TO ME.

915
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:51,871
I KICKED HIM

916
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,740
OUT OF MY MOM'S HOUSE.

917
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:54,574
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO TALK

918
00:22:54,574 --> 00:22:55,842
TO HIM RIGHT NOW.

919
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:57,510
MOM?

920
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,611
DID YOU REDO MY DOCTOR

921
00:22:58,611 --> 00:22:59,145
APPOINTMENT?

922
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:01,614
THIS REALLY HURTS.

923
00:23:01,614 --> 00:23:04,183
>> * FROM THE LIGHTS ABOVE

924
00:23:04,183 --> 00:23:07,219
* STARS WILL FLY

925
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:07,887
>> I DON'T KNOW.

926
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:08,655
WHEN I WENT TO SLEEP LAST NIGHT,

927
00:23:08,655 --> 00:23:09,856
I COULDN'T GET THE PICTURE

928
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:10,657
OUT OF MY HEAD,

929
00:23:10,657 --> 00:23:11,357
AND SO I STARTED CRYING.

930
00:23:11,357 --> 00:23:12,224
AND I TOOK ALL HIS STUFF,

931
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,325
AND I, LIKE, PUT IT IN A BOX,

932
00:23:13,325 --> 00:23:15,762
AND I THREW IT IN THE CLOSET.

933
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:16,496
MY ROOM JUST GOT, LIKE,

934
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:17,697
DE-SKYLARIZED.

935
00:23:17,697 --> 00:23:20,232
>> OH.

936
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:20,900
SO HOW LONG DO YOU THINK

937
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,502
YOU'LL TAKE TO GET OVER IT AND,

938
00:23:22,502 --> 00:23:27,239
LIKE, MAKE HIM REDEEM HIMSELF?

939
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,741
>> I DON'T REALLY KNOW,

940
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:29,742
'CAUSE HE DOESN'T, LIKE,

941
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,277
GET HOW THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS

942
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:33,913
I THINK ARE BASED ON LIES NOW

943
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,248
BECAUSE THE TRUST WAS A LIE.

944
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:39,418
BUT HE JUST HAS TO MAKE--

945
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,620
>> BUILD YOUR TRUST?

946
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,455
>> REBUILD THE TRUST, YEAH,

947
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:43,322
AND THEN START PROVING TO ME

948
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:45,458
THAT IT'S GONNA BE ALL RIGHT

949
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:46,793
AND LAST FOREVER AND HE'S NEVER

950
00:23:46,793 --> 00:23:49,228
GONNA DO ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

951
00:23:58,471 --> 00:23:59,839
TO KEEP MY MIND OFF THE FACT

952
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:00,540
THAT SKYLAR CHEATED ON ME,

953
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,374
I'VE BEEN FOCUSING MORE ON

954
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:03,409
COLLEGE.

955
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:04,644
I'VE ALREADY ENROLLED IN TWO

956
00:24:04,644 --> 00:24:05,912
CLASSES, WHICH TAKE UP MOST

957
00:24:05,912 --> 00:24:07,413
OF MY TIME.

958
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:08,380
NOW THAT THERE'S THE POSSIBILITY

959
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:10,850
OF PARENTING WITHOUT SKYLAR,

960
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,384
I'VE DECIDED TO PUT MY DREAM

961
00:24:12,384 --> 00:24:13,452
OF PLAYING IN THE VIRGINIA

962
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:14,987
ORCHESTRA ON HOLD FOR A MORE

963
00:24:14,987 --> 00:24:16,556
STABLE CAREER AS AN ULTRASOUND

964
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:18,591
TECHNICIAN.

965
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:21,761
TODAY I'M MEETING WITH

966
00:24:21,761 --> 00:24:22,895
A COLLEGE COUNSELOR TO MAKE SURE

967
00:24:22,895 --> 00:24:24,096
I'M ON THE RIGHT TRACK.

968
00:24:24,096 --> 00:24:25,932
>> YOU HAVE TO HAVE TAKEN

969
00:24:25,932 --> 00:24:26,566
MEDICAL TERMINOLOGY.

970
00:24:26,566 --> 00:24:27,834
>> MM-HMM.

971
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:28,735
>> YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN "A"

972
00:24:28,735 --> 00:24:29,502
OR A "B" IN BIO 141.

973
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:32,605
ALSO YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN OVERALL

974
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:35,708
GPA OF 3.0, AND YOU HAVE TO HAVE

975
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:37,409
SOME FORMAL ACCREDITED MEDICAL

976
00:24:37,409 --> 00:24:39,879
EDUCATION, AND YOU HAVE TO PASS

977
00:24:39,879 --> 00:24:41,548
YOUR EXAMS.

978
00:24:41,548 --> 00:24:44,551
EACH OF THESE EXAMS COSTS $200,

979
00:24:44,551 --> 00:24:46,385
AND EACH OF THESE EXAMS HAS

980
00:24:46,385 --> 00:24:47,754
A NATIONAL PASS RATE OF

981
00:24:47,754 --> 00:24:50,422
ABOUT 50%.

982
00:24:50,422 --> 00:24:51,490
>> THIS SOUNDS LIKE A LOT

983
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,592
OF WORK.

984
00:24:52,592 --> 00:24:53,593
I WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO DO IT

985
00:24:53,593 --> 00:24:55,962
ON MY OWN.

986
00:24:57,597 --> 00:24:58,865
I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT

987
00:24:58,865 --> 00:24:59,999
ABOUT WHAT SKYLAR DID

988
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:00,767
AND HOW MUCH OUR BABY NEEDS TO

989
00:25:00,767 --> 00:25:03,069
HAVE TWO PARENTS WHO LOVE HER.

990
00:25:03,069 --> 00:25:03,736
EVEN THOUGH HE HURT ME,

991
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:05,104
I'M WILLING TO GIVE HIM

992
00:25:05,104 --> 00:25:05,838
A SECOND CHANCE, 'CAUSE

993
00:25:05,838 --> 00:25:07,473
I REALLY WANT THIS TO WORK,

994
00:25:07,473 --> 00:25:09,576
NOT ONLY FOR ME BUT FOR SUMMER.

995
00:25:09,576 --> 00:25:11,043
[line rings]

996
00:25:11,043 --> 00:25:12,044
>> HEY.

997
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:13,880
CAN YOU COME OVER?

998
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,714
>> YEAH, I CAN.

999
00:25:14,714 --> 00:25:15,915
>> OKAY, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU

1000
00:25:15,915 --> 00:25:17,584
ABOUT SOMETHING.

1001
00:25:17,584 --> 00:25:19,619
>> OKAY.

1002
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,602
>> I THINK YOU SHOULD COME BACK.

1003
00:25:35,602 --> 00:25:37,469
>> OKAY.

1004
00:25:37,469 --> 00:25:38,204
>> I MISS YOU, AND I THINK

1005
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:39,972
WE NEED TO WORK STUFF OUT.

1006
00:25:39,972 --> 00:25:42,541
BUT I STILL DON'T TRUST YOU.

1007
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,943
>> I KNOW YOU DON'T TRUST ME,

1008
00:25:43,943 --> 00:25:45,111
BUT I'M GONNA DO EVERYTHING

1009
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:48,047
I CAN TO MAKE IT BETTER.

1010
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:48,815
>> YOU KNOW YOU'RE MY BEST

1011
00:25:48,815 --> 00:25:49,616
FRIEND?

1012
00:25:49,616 --> 00:25:51,250
>> YES, AND YOU'RE MINE.

1013
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,084
>> I DIDN'T LIKE LOSING

1014
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:53,519
MY BEST FRIEND.

1015
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:54,587
>> I DIDN'T LIKE IT EITHER.

1016
00:25:54,587 --> 00:25:55,655
>> I'VE NEVER BEEN BEST FRIENDS,

1017
00:25:55,655 --> 00:25:56,656
LIKE, WITH A BOYFRIEND

1018
00:25:56,656 --> 00:25:58,758
OR ANYTHING BEFORE.

1019
00:25:58,758 --> 00:25:59,558
AND THAT MEANS MORE TO ME

1020
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:00,492
THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

1021
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:02,829
>> SO ARE YOU GONNA PUT BACK ON

1022
00:26:02,829 --> 00:26:04,664
YOUR RING?

1023
00:26:04,664 --> 00:26:07,800
OKAY.

1024
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:08,935
>> EVEN THOUGH I'M NOT READY

1025
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:10,169
TO PUT MY RING BACK ON,

1026
00:26:10,169 --> 00:26:10,870
I'M GLAD SKYLAR AND I

1027
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:12,605
ARE TOGETHER AGAIN.

1028
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:13,706
YOU KNOW YOU'RE EXCITED TO HAVE

1029
00:26:13,706 --> 00:26:17,744
A LITTLE GIRL TO PUT IN THERE.

1030
00:26:17,744 --> 00:26:18,678
>> SO DOES SKYLAR LIVE WITH YOU

1031
00:26:18,678 --> 00:26:19,011
AGAIN?

1032
00:26:19,011 --> 00:26:19,612
>> YEAH.

1033
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:20,613
IT'S LIKE, IT WASN'T THE SAME

1034
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:21,547
WITHOUT HIM THERE.

1035
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:23,182
PLUS, I HATE SLEEPING

1036
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:24,050
WITHOUT HIM THERE.

1037
00:26:24,050 --> 00:26:24,851
>> HE SEEMS LIKE HE'S CHANGED

1038
00:26:24,851 --> 00:26:26,585
FOR THE BETTER.

1039
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:27,319
>> YEAH, BETWEEN WHEN WE FIRST

1040
00:26:27,319 --> 00:26:29,622
GOT TOGETHER AND, LIKE, NOW,

1041
00:26:29,622 --> 00:26:31,724
HE'S LIKE A DIFFERENT PERSON.

1042
00:26:31,724 --> 00:26:32,391
LIKE, HE DOESN'T STAY OUT

1043
00:26:32,391 --> 00:26:33,292
REALLY LATE, 'CAUSE HE'LL COME

1044
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:34,126
HOME, AND WE'LL HANG OUT FOR

1045
00:26:34,126 --> 00:26:36,262
A COUPLE HOURS AND HAVE OUR TIME

1046
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:37,063
THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE VERY

1047
00:26:37,063 --> 00:26:39,198
MUCH OF ONCE THE BABY'S HERE.

1048
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:41,701
>> MM-HMM.

1049
00:26:41,701 --> 00:26:42,802
>> SKYLAR MOVED BACK IN

1050
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:44,170
JUST IN TIME,

1051
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:44,904
'CAUSE A FEW DAYS LATER,

1052
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:46,806
I WENT INTO LABOR.

1053
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:49,208
>> YOU'RE DOING GREAT, BABY.

1054
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:54,947
>> * SLOW YOUR BREATH DOWN

1055
00:26:54,947 --> 00:26:56,282
* JUST TAKE IT SLOW

* FIND YOUR HEART NOW

OF PUSHING...

[gasps]

1070
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:20,807
SUMMER WAS BORN.

>> [crying]

1072
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:24,811
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

[camera shutter clicks]

1074
00:27:31,951 --> 00:27:34,987
[baby cries]

1075
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:40,893
>> OW, IT'S SO SORE.

1076
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:41,894
SHE'S BEEN DOING THIS FOR,

1077
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:44,063
LIKE, AN HOUR.

1078
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:45,031
YES.

1079
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:45,932
I HAVEN'T GOTTEN TO EAT

1080
00:27:45,932 --> 00:27:48,367
MY LUNCH YET.

1081
00:27:48,367 --> 00:27:49,201
>> I'M SORRY.

1082
00:27:49,201 --> 00:27:49,836
>> OR TAKE A SHOWER.

1083
00:27:49,836 --> 00:27:50,903
>> I'D DO IT FOR YOU,

1084
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:53,773
BUT I CAN'T.

1085
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:54,941
THE FIRST FEW ATTEMPTS AT

1086
00:27:54,941 --> 00:27:57,443
FEEDING HER WERE REALLY PAINFUL,

1087
00:27:57,443 --> 00:27:58,778
BUT BREAST-FEEDING IS CHEAPER

1088
00:27:58,778 --> 00:28:00,112
THAN BUYING BABY FORMULA,

1089
00:28:00,112 --> 00:28:02,148
SO I'M GONNA KEEP TRYING.

1090
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,184
WE'RE BEING DISCHARGED FROM

1091
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:06,452
THE HOSPITAL TODAY.

1092
00:28:06,452 --> 00:28:10,389
AW, SORRY IT'S A BUMPY RIDE.

1093
00:28:13,793 --> 00:28:14,526
>> SHE DOES SEEM TO BE

1094
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:15,361
A MITE HUNGRY.

1095
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:16,528
>> IS IT TIME TO EAT?

1096
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:17,897
>> OW.

1097
00:28:17,897 --> 00:28:18,397
HEY, NO.

1098
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:21,433
DON'T STOP ALREADY.

1099
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:22,802
BABY GIRL COULDN'T HAVE

1100
00:28:22,802 --> 00:28:23,435
A BETTER DADDY.

1101
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:27,073
SHE GOOD?

1102
00:28:27,073 --> 00:28:27,940
>> YOU'RE ACTING LIKE YOU'RE

1103
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:28,908
STILL HUNGRY.

1104
00:28:28,908 --> 00:28:30,142
>> [playfully] STOP BEING

1105
00:28:30,142 --> 00:28:32,178
HUNGRY.

1106
00:28:32,178 --> 00:28:34,346
OW-HO-HO.

1107
00:28:34,346 --> 00:28:36,849
LITTLE GIRL.

1108
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:38,184
THAT HURTS.

1109
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:40,452
YOU'RE HUNGRY?

1110
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:40,953
OW, OW, OW.

1111
00:28:40,953 --> 00:28:41,487
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

1112
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:44,090
BREAST-FEEDING SUMMER AT HOME

1113
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:44,857
ISN'T GETTING ANY EASIER.

1114
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:45,491
I THINK I'M GONNA SWITCH

1115
00:28:45,491 --> 00:28:48,494
TO FORMULA.

1116
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:50,329
>> SO ARE YOU TOTALLY DONE

1117
00:28:50,329 --> 00:28:51,831
WITH BREAST-FEEDING?

1118
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:53,966
>> YES, I AM.

1119
00:28:53,966 --> 00:28:54,666
I DON'T THINK IT'S SUPPOSED

1120
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,402
TO HURT LIKE THAT.

1121
00:28:56,402 --> 00:28:58,170
IT DOESN'T HURT AS MUCH NOW,

1122
00:28:58,170 --> 00:28:59,872
BUT IT SURE IS EXPENSIVE,

1123
00:28:59,872 --> 00:29:01,507
ESPECIALLY ON TOP OF DIAPERS

1124
00:29:01,507 --> 00:29:03,375
AND OTHER BABY SUPPLIES.

1125
00:29:03,375 --> 00:29:04,310
AND WITH SKYLAR ONLY WORKING

1126
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:05,544

00:34:32,671 --> 00:34:33,472
MAMA DOESN'T WANT

1312
00:34:33,472 --> 00:34:34,906
TO GO TO CLASS ANYMORE.

1313
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:35,941
LET'S FORGET THE HOMEWORK,

1314
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:36,975
AND I'LL HANG OUT WITH YOU.

1315
00:34:43,482 --> 00:34:45,717
[birds tweeting]

1316
00:34:45,717 --> 00:34:47,719
WHAT TIME DO YOU HAVE CLASS?

1317
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:48,920
>> 11:00.

1318
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:49,755
DO YOU HAVE CLASS AT

1319
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:50,856
THE SAME TIME?

1320
00:34:50,856 --> 00:34:51,690
>> I HAVE CLASS FROM 11:00

1321
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:52,858
TO 2:00.

1322
00:34:52,858 --> 00:34:53,859
BUT I DON'T THINK I'M GOING

1323
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:54,693
TODAY, SO MOM DOESN'T HAVE

1324
00:34:54,693 --> 00:34:56,595
TO WATCH HER.

1325
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:58,063
>> WHY AREN'T YOU GOING?

1326
00:34:58,063 --> 00:34:59,965
>> SO THAT I CAN BE WITH SUMMER.

1327
00:34:59,965 --> 00:35:00,899
I'D RATHER SPEND TIME WITH HER

1328
00:35:00,899 --> 00:35:02,668
THAN GO TO CLASS.

1329
00:35:02,668 --> 00:35:03,135
>> SO WHAT?

1330
00:35:03,135 --> 00:35:04,836
ARE YOU JUST NOT GOING ANYMORE?

1331
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:05,837
>> NO.

1332
00:35:05,837 --> 00:35:06,605
I'M GONNA GO AND DROP OUT,

1333
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:08,874
AND THEN I CAN STAY HOME ALL DAY

1334
00:35:08,874 --> 00:35:09,475
WITH MY BABY GIRL.

1335
00:35:09,475 --> 00:35:11,210
>> SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO

1336
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:13,745
BESIDES--I MEAN, INSTEAD OF

1337
00:35:13,745 --> 00:35:15,181
GOING TO TCC?

1338
00:35:15,181 --> 00:35:16,114
>> I'M GONNA FIND SOMETHING

1339
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,050
TO DO, LIKE, SO I CAN GET--

1340
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:20,752
LIKE, MAKE MONEY AND STUFF

1341
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:21,920
BUT NOT BE AWAY FROM HER FOR

1342
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,255
FOUR YEARS FOR A CAREER I DON'T

1343
00:35:23,255 --> 00:35:25,524
WANT TO DO.

1344
00:35:25,524 --> 00:35:27,092
AND MONEY COULD HELP RIGHT NOW.

1345
00:35:27,092 --> 00:35:29,127
WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT IT?

1346
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:29,828
EVEN THOUGH I'M STILL

1347
00:35:29,828 --> 00:35:31,830
GONNA DO IT, LIKE, REGARDLESS.

1348
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,499
>> SO IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER.

1349
00:35:33,499 --> 00:35:34,833
LIKE, IF THAT'S REALLY WHAT

1350
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:36,602
YOU WANT TO DO.

1351
00:35:36,602 --> 00:35:37,703
I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE TO,

1352
00:35:37,703 --> 00:35:43,975
LIKE, QUIT AT ANYTHING, SO...

1353
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,211
WHEN ARE YOU DOING IT?

1354
00:35:45,211 --> 00:35:47,946
>> LIKE, TODAY.

1355
00:36:04,129 --> 00:36:06,932
>> BALANCING COLLEGE COURSES

1356
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:10,669
AND BEING A MOM IS TOO HARD.

1357
00:36:10,669 --> 00:36:11,503
SO I'M ENROLLING IN A SIX-WEEK

1358
00:36:11,503 --> 00:36:13,104
TRAINING PROGRAM TO LEARN

1359
00:36:13,104 --> 00:36:13,672
MEDICAL BILLING

1360
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:16,608
AND DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOL.

1361
00:36:16,608 --> 00:36:17,776
>> SO WHAT BRINGS YOU IN TODAY?

1362
00:36:17,776 --> 00:36:20,612
>> I WANTED TO DROP THE CLASSES

1363
00:36:20,612 --> 00:36:21,813
I'M IN NOW.

1364
00:36:21,813 --> 00:36:22,648
>> WHAT DRAWS YOU TO THAT

1365
00:36:22,648 --> 00:36:23,114
CONCLUSION?

1366
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:23,882
>> I WAS KEEPING UP MY GRADES

1367
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:25,150
AND EVERYTHING, BUT I WOULD JUST

1368
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:26,017
RATHER RIGHT NOW SPEND MORE TIME

1369
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,153
WITH HER THAN IN CLASS.

1370
00:36:28,153 --> 00:36:29,421
>> YEAH.

1371
00:36:29,421 --> 00:36:30,088
WOULD THERE BE ANY CHANCE

1372
00:36:30,088 --> 00:36:30,822
IF YOU JUST WANTED TO WITHDRAW

1373
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:31,790
OUT OF ONE?

1374
00:36:31,790 --> 00:36:32,824
>> I'M JUST GONNA WITHDRAW

1375
00:36:32,824 --> 00:36:33,992
OUT OF ALL OF THEM.

1376
00:36:33,992 --> 00:36:34,993
>> OKAY, ONCE YOU SELECT

1377
00:36:34,993 --> 00:36:36,995
YOUR CLASSES, THEN YOU JUST HIT

1378
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:37,563
"DROP" AGAIN.

1379
00:36:37,563 --> 00:36:39,565
OKAY.

1380
00:36:39,565 --> 00:36:40,732
>> MY CLASSES HAVE BEEN DROPPED.

1381
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:42,668
>> LOOKS LIKE YOU DROPPED THEM.

1382
00:36:42,668 --> 00:36:43,669
>> SEE, YOU GOT MAMA TO CHANGE

1383
00:36:43,669 --> 00:36:45,170
HER WHOLE LIFE PLAN.

1384
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,739
BUT I GUESS I'LL FORGIVE YOU.

1385
00:36:47,739 --> 00:36:50,809
DROPPING MY CLASSES SUCKED.

1386
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:52,043
NOW I GOT TO TELL MY DAD.

1387
00:36:52,043 --> 00:36:53,211
OH, MY GOODNESS.

1388
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:57,883
PURSE, GET IT TOGETHER.

1389
00:36:57,883 --> 00:36:58,717
>> WHAT'S GOING ON WITH SCHOOL?

1390
00:36:58,717 --> 00:37:01,587
>> I GOT A 3.5 OUT OF 4 POINTS

1391
00:37:01,587 --> 00:37:02,187
ON A ENGLISH ESSAY.

1392
00:37:02,187 --> 00:37:03,889
>> THAT'S GOOD.

1393
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:04,890
>> YEAH, IT IS GOOD.

1394
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,758
I'M DROPPING OUT, THOUGH.

1395
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:08,694
>> BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING SO WELL?

1396
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:09,695
>> YEAH, I'M JUST GONNA DO

1397
00:37:09,695 --> 00:37:10,696
MEDICAL BILLING, 'CAUSE IT TAKES

1398
00:37:10,696 --> 00:37:11,697
SIX WEEKS TO GET IT, AND IT

1399
00:37:11,697 --> 00:37:12,364
MAKES A LOT OF GOOD MONEY.

1400
00:37:12,364 --> 00:37:14,032
>> AND YOU THINK THAT'S WHAT

1401
00:37:14,032 --> 00:37:14,833
YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO DO FOR

1402
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:15,567
THE REST OF YOUR LIFE?

1403
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:16,268
>> DOESN'T MATTER IF I WANT

1404
00:37:16,268 --> 00:37:17,002
TO DO IT OR NOT.

1405
00:37:17,002 --> 00:37:17,769
I'M GONNA BE A MOMMY MOST

1406
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:18,837
OF THE TIME.

1407
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:19,805
>> YES, I KNOW.

1408
00:37:19,805 --> 00:37:20,539
BUT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT

1409
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:22,741
FUTURE LIZZIE, THE ONE THAT'S

1410
00:37:22,741 --> 00:37:23,442
NOT GONNA BE HAPPY THAT SHE

1411
00:37:23,442 --> 00:37:24,810
DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL.

1412
00:37:24,810 --> 00:37:25,611
>> OKAY, WELL, FUTURE LIZZIE

1413
00:37:25,611 --> 00:37:26,812
WILL BE HAPPY WITH SUMMER.

1414
00:37:26,812 --> 00:37:27,479
>> OH, YOU THINK THAT NOW,

1415
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:28,046
BUT I'M TELLING YOU,

1416
00:37:28,046 --> 00:37:28,814
IN THE LONG RUN, YOU'RE GONNA

1417
00:37:28,814 --> 00:37:30,682
FIND OUT THAT'S NOT THE TRUTH.

1418
00:37:30,682 --> 00:37:31,550
I TOLD YOU YOU SHOULDN'T SIGN UP

1419
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:34,052
FOR COLLEGE CLASSES SO SOON.

1420
00:37:34,052 --> 00:37:34,820
>> BUT I HAVE "A"s IN MY COLLEGE

1421
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,654
CLASSES, SO IT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT

1422
00:37:35,654 --> 00:37:37,789
THAT I'M DOING BAD IN THEM.

1423
00:37:37,789 --> 00:37:38,624
>> BUT IT'S A LOT FOR YOU TO TRY

1424
00:37:38,624 --> 00:37:40,926
TO TAKE ON AT ONE TIME.

1425
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:42,227
>> I COULD DO IT PERFECTLY FINE.

1426
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:43,795
I JUST WOULD RATHER BE WITH HER

1427
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:45,831
THAN GO TO CLASS AND HAVE HER.

1428
00:37:45,831 --> 00:37:47,132
>> BUT BEFORE YOU HAD HER,

1429
00:37:47,132 --> 00:37:47,966
YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD

1430
00:37:47,966 --> 00:37:51,637
HANDLE IT ALL.

1431
00:37:51,637 --> 00:37:53,171
SOMEDAY WHEN YOUR DAUGHTER

1432
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:53,972
DECIDES SHE DOESN'T WANT TO GO

1433
00:37:53,972 --> 00:37:55,974
TO COLLEGE, YOU'LL UNDERSTAND.

1434
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:57,075
>> I WANT HER TO BE HAPPY.

1435
00:37:57,075 --> 00:37:57,909
IF COLLEGE DOESN'T MAKE HER

1436
00:37:57,909 --> 00:37:58,744
HAPPY, THEN SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO.

1437
00:37:58,744 --> 00:38:00,145
>> BUT THE--

1438
00:38:00,145 --> 00:38:01,046
[clears throat]

1439
00:38:01,046 --> 00:38:03,081
I WISH, WHEN I WAS YOUR AGE,

1440
00:38:03,081 --> 00:38:04,683
I WAS NEARLY AS SMART AS YOU,

1441
00:38:04,683 --> 00:38:05,784
'CAUSE ALL THE THINGS THAT

1442
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:06,752
I THOUGHT I KNEW TURNED OUT

1443
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:08,787
TO BE WRONG.

1444
00:38:13,359 --> 00:38:15,293
>> IF SHE EVER FINISHES THIS

1445
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,662
BOTTLE, DO YOU WANT TO GO

1446
00:38:16,662 --> 00:38:18,029
FOR A WALK?

1447
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:19,264
>> SURE.

1448
00:38:19,264 --> 00:38:20,131
>> YOU GET TO GO IN YOUR

1449
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,800
STROLLER.

1450
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,301
ARE YOU DONE?

1451
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,170
EVEN THOUGH SKYLAR IS

1452
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:25,937
DISAPPOINTED THAT I DROPPED OUT

1453
00:38:25,937 --> 00:38:27,773
OF COLLEGE, HE STILL WANTS ME

1454
00:38:27,773 --> 00:38:30,942
TO BE HAPPY, AND SO DO I.

00:38:37,082 --> 00:38:38,083
>> SO HOW DO YOU LIKE

1457
00:38:38,083 --> 00:38:39,317
BEING A DADDY?

1458
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:42,187
>> I LOVE IT.

1459
00:38:42,187 --> 00:38:42,754
>> REALLY, NOW?

1460
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:43,422
>> YES.

1461
00:38:43,422 --> 00:38:45,424
>> BEST 19-YEAR-OLD DADDY

1462
00:38:45,424 --> 00:38:47,393
I KNOW.

1463
00:38:47,393 --> 00:38:48,360
>> [laughs]

1464
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,395
WHY DO YOU THINK THAT?

1465
00:38:49,395 --> 00:38:52,364
>> BECAUSE YOU HELP ME IN

1466
00:38:52,364 --> 00:38:53,098
THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT,

1467
00:38:53,098 --> 00:38:53,832
AND YOU TAKE HER WHEN I NEED

1468
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,834
A BREAK, AND YOU FEED HER

1469
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,168
AND PLAY WITH HER, AND Y'ALL

1470
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:01,106
BOND SO FABULOUSLY.

1471
00:39:01,106 --> 00:39:03,775
>> * COULD YOU WAIT FOR A DAY?

1472
00:39:03,775 --> 00:39:04,876
>> BEFORE I GOT PREGNANT,

1473
00:39:04,876 --> 00:39:06,277
I HAD A BUNCH OF DREAMS:

1474
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:07,779
TO GO TO MY SENIOR YEAR

1475
00:39:07,779 --> 00:39:08,947
AND DO ALL THE HIGH SCHOOL

1476
00:39:08,947 --> 00:39:09,815
THINGS LIKE HOMECOMING

1477
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:11,082
AND SENIOR PROM,

1478
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:12,751
AND MY BIGGEST DREAM WAS TO

1479
00:39:12,751 --> 00:39:14,386
PLAY THE FLUTE IN THE VIRGINIA

1480
00:39:14,386 --> 00:39:14,853
SYMPHONY.

1481
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:15,521
AND THEN I FOUND OUT I WAS

1482
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:17,423
PREGNANT, AND THAT DREAM JUST

1483
00:39:17,423 --> 00:39:19,157
KIND OF DIED.

1484
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:19,858
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA OF

1485
00:39:19,858 --> 00:39:20,759
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO?

1486
00:39:20,759 --> 00:39:21,460
>> NOPE, JUST SOMETHING THAT

1487
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,061
MAKES PRETTY GOOD MONEY.

1488
00:39:23,061 --> 00:39:24,830
AND I GUESS HAVING A BABY AT 17

1489
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:25,531
TOTALLY FLIPPED ALL MY PLANS

1490
00:39:25,531 --> 00:39:27,499
FOR THE FUTURE.

1491
00:39:27,499 --> 00:39:29,367
I'M NOT IN COLLEGE ANYMORE.

1492
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,101
I'M NOT GOING INTO MUSIC

1493
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:32,103
ANYMORE.

1494
00:39:32,103 --> 00:39:34,139
I'M PROBABLY GONNA LIVE AT HOME

1495
00:39:34,139 --> 00:39:35,273
A LITTLE BIT LONGER INSTEAD

1496
00:39:35,273 --> 00:39:36,274
OF A DORM.

1497
00:39:36,274 --> 00:39:37,108
LET'S ASK DADDY IF HE'LL GO

1498
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:38,076
MAKE YOU A BOTTLE.

1499
00:39:38,076 --> 00:39:38,810
I THINK THEY SHOULD BE DONE

1500
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,011
IN THE DISHWASHER NOW.

1501
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:41,513
AND IT'S BUMMED ME OUT

1502
00:39:41,513 --> 00:39:44,015
A COUPLE TIMES, BUT THEN I'LL

1503
00:39:44,015 --> 00:39:45,016
THINK ABOUT IT, AND I'LL THINK

1504
00:39:45,016 --> 00:39:47,018
OF SUMMER, AND IN MY MIND,

1505
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:48,353
WHAT I'M DOING BEING A MOM

1506
00:39:48,353 --> 00:39:50,021
IS FAR MORE IMPORTANT THAN

1507
00:39:50,021 --> 00:39:52,357
JUST GOING OUT AND HAVING FUN.

1508
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:53,191
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN I WANT

1509
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:55,160
SUMMER TO BE A MOM AT 17.

1510
00:39:55,160 --> 00:39:56,027
I WANT HER TO STILL GO TO

1511
00:39:56,027 --> 00:39:56,762
COLLEGE AND HAVE HER TEENAGE

1512
00:39:56,762 --> 00:39:58,530
YEARS.

1513
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,398
>> SO HAVE YOUR DREAMS CHANGED

1514
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,100
A LOT?

1515
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:02,568
>> YEAH.

1516
00:40:02,568 --> 00:40:03,602
BEFORE HER, I WANTED TO BE,

1517
00:40:03,602 --> 00:40:06,304
LIKE, A MUSICIAN.

1518
00:40:06,304 --> 00:40:07,606
THE ROUGHEST PART ABOUT HAVING

1519
00:40:07,606 --> 00:40:11,142
A BABY RIGHT NOW IS JUST

1520
00:40:11,142 --> 00:40:11,777
WORRYING ABOUT MONEY,

1521
00:40:11,777 --> 00:40:12,478
BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A JOB

1522
00:40:12,478 --> 00:40:14,212
RIGHT NOW.

1523
00:40:14,212 --> 00:40:16,081
IT'S FORMULA, $33;

1524
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:18,684
DIAPERS, $20; GAS DROPS, $15;

1525
00:40:18,684 --> 00:40:20,051
WIPES, $7;

1526
00:40:20,051 --> 00:40:22,921
LOVING OUR DAUGHTER, PRICELESS.

1527
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:24,556
IF I COULD GO BACK TO WHEN

1528
00:40:24,556 --> 00:40:26,324
IT ALL HAPPENED, I WOULD

1529
00:40:26,324 --> 00:40:27,593
DEFINITELY HAVE WAITED,

1530
00:40:27,593 --> 00:40:30,328
AND I WOULD HAVE JUST WANTED

1531
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:31,563
TO WAIT, LIKE, FIVE YEARS.

1532
00:40:31,563 --> 00:40:33,064
>> HE MUST BE DOING GOOD WITH

1533
00:40:33,064 --> 00:40:34,232
SUMMER, OR LIZZIE WOULD BE

1534
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:35,166
SAYING SOMETHING.

1535
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:35,701
>> YEP.

1536
00:40:35,701 --> 00:40:36,468
>> SHE'S NOT ONE TO KEEP IT

1537
00:40:36,468 --> 00:40:37,368
TO HERSELF.

1538
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:38,269
OF COURSE, IT GETS HARDER AND

1539
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:39,037
HARDER AS THEY GET OLDER

1540
00:40:39,037 --> 00:40:39,605
AND OLDER.

1541
00:40:39,605 --> 00:40:41,106
>> IN THE FUTURE, EVERYTHING'S

1542
00:40:41,106 --> 00:40:42,508
NOT GONNA BE PERFECT.

1543
00:40:42,508 --> 00:40:43,509
WE'LL HAVE OUR PROBLEMS,

1544
00:40:43,509 --> 00:40:44,510
BUT I CAN ONLY SEE THEM

1545
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:46,011
MAKING US STRONGER AS A COUPLE.

1546
00:40:46,011 --> 00:40:47,345
BUT RIGHT NOW, I'M FOCUSING

1547
00:40:47,345 --> 00:40:49,380
MOSTLY ON BEING A GOOD MOM.

A PREGNANCY?

CLOTHES?

1556

1557

1558
00:41:11,069 --> 00:41:12,270
YOU LOOK PREGNANT.

1559
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,271
>> THIS IS WHAT HE DOES.

1560
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:13,972
HE SHUTS ME OUT.

1561
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:14,573
>> YOU ARE THE FATHER

1562
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:15,440
OF THAT CHILD.

1563
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,241
>> IT WAS YOUR DECISION TO MAKE.

1564
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:17,308
>> YEAH.

1565
00:41:17,308 --> 00:41:18,209
>> HER DECISION.

1566
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:19,177
>> HER DECISION, JONATHAN?

1567
00:41:19,177 --> 00:41:21,246
>> [groaning]

1568
00:41:21,246 --> 00:41:23,148
OH, MY GOD.

1569
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:24,482
YOU LEFT THE MILK OUT AGAIN.

1570
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:26,451
>> SHUT THE [...] UP.

1571
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:29,220
>> JOE!
