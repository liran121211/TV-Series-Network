00:00:03,033 --> 00:00:06,200
>> [gasping and laughing]

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:07,033
THERE YOU GO, KYARA.

3
00:00:07,033 --> 00:00:07,867
>> I'M SAVON.

4
00:00:07,867 --> 00:00:09,167
I LIVE IN MARIETTA, GEORGIA,

5
00:00:09,167 --> 00:00:11,133
A SUBURB OUTSIDE OF ATLANTA,

6
00:00:11,133 --> 00:00:13,033
WITH MY AUNT LADONNA AND COUSINS

7
00:00:13,033 --> 00:00:14,400
KAHLEM AND PHILIP.

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,033
I'M A JUNIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL, AND

9
00:00:16,033 --> 00:00:18,200
I'VE ALWAYS GOTTEN GOOD GRADES.

10
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,533
BUT PLAYING BASKETBALL

11
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:20,933
IS WHAT KEEPS ME FOCUSED,

12
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:22,233
AND I'M HOPING TO GO TO COLLEGE

13
00:00:22,233 --> 00:00:23,600
ON A SPORTS SCHOLARSHIP.

14
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:25,000
MY DREAM FOR THE FUTURE IS

15
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,033
TO BECOME A SINGER/SONGWRITER...

16
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:29,200
* THEY WILL SAVE US

17
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,533
AND TO EVENTUALLY GET MARRIED

18
00:00:30,533 --> 00:00:32,133
AND HAVE A FAMILY.

19
00:00:32,133 --> 00:00:33,567
I MET MY BOYFRIEND, MAUWI,

20
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:34,667
ON THE BASKETBALL COURT,

21
00:00:34,667 --> 00:00:36,867
AND WE HIT IT OFF RIGHT AWAY.

22
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:38,067
BUT WE WERE FRIENDS FOR A WHILE

23
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:40,367
BEFORE WE BECAME A COUPLE.

24
00:00:40,367 --> 00:00:41,833
DON'T EMBARRASS YOURSELF NOW.

25
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:42,500
>> UGH.

26
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,967
>> OOH, YOU DID IT ANYWAYS.

27
00:00:43,967 --> 00:00:44,867
HE JUST STARTED COLLEGE

28
00:00:44,867 --> 00:00:46,500
AND IS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF ME

29
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,867
AND MY DREAMS.

30
00:00:47,867 --> 00:00:49,200
WE HAVE A GREAT RELATIONSHIP,

31
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,300
AND I'M REALLY HAPPY WITH HIM.

32
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,400
BUT BEFORE I STARTED DATING

33
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,700
MAUWI, I FELL FOR

34
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:56,200
THIS OTHER GUY, ELI.

35
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,133
AFTER WE HOOKED UP A COUPLE

36
00:00:57,133 --> 00:01:01,200
TIMES, HE FORGOT ALL ABOUT ME.

37
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:01,867
HAVE A SEAT, SIR.

38
00:01:01,867 --> 00:01:02,533
>> NO, GIVE ME A HUG.

39
00:01:02,533 --> 00:01:03,367
>> NO, I DON'T WANT A HUG.

40
00:01:03,367 --> 00:01:04,200
GET OFF ME.

41
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,267
NOW THAT I'M WITH MAUWI,

42
00:01:05,267 --> 00:01:06,500
I WISH I COULD FORGET

43
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:07,700
ABOUT ELI TOO, BUT

44
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:09,767
THAT'S GOING TO BE IMPOSSIBLE,

45
00:01:09,767 --> 00:01:12,200
BECAUSE I'M PREGNANT

46
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,200
WITH ELI'S BABY.

47
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:22,900
I'M REALLY GRATEFUL TO BE

48
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,967
LIVING WITH MY AUNT LADONNA.

49
00:01:24,967 --> 00:01:26,067
EVEN THOUGH SHE'S DISAPPOINTED

50
00:01:26,067 --> 00:01:27,100
ABOUT MY PREGNANCY,

51
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:28,500
I KNOW I CAN DEPEND ON HER

52
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,367
TO HELP ME THROUGH IT ALL.

53
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:31,867
IS THIS IT?

54
00:01:31,867 --> 00:01:32,800
>> I MEAN, IT'S A LOT OF--

55
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:33,700
YOU GOT A LOT OF OPTIONS.

56
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:35,433
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "IS THIS IT?"

57
00:01:35,433 --> 00:01:37,067
[both laugh]

58
00:01:37,067 --> 00:01:38,200
>> IT'S TOO PAGES.

59
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,167
>> OH.

60
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:40,067
>> YOU REMEMBER THE DAY YOU

61
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,433
FOUND OUT YOU WAS PREGNANT?

62
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:42,467
>> YEAH.

63
00:01:42,467 --> 00:01:43,400
THE FIRST THING THAT POPPED IN

64
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,333
MY HEAD WHEN I FOUND OUT,

65
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:45,067
I WAS LIKE,

66
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:46,200
"I'M NOT KEEPING IT."

67
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,067
'CAUSE I ALREADY KNEW IT WAS

68
00:01:47,067 --> 00:01:47,800
ELI'S, SO I WAS LIKE,

69
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,200
"WHY KEEP IT?"

70
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,300
IT'S LIKE, "WHY HAVE A BABY BY A

71
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,533
GUY THAT DOESN'T EVEN LIKE ME?"

72
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:52,867
LIKE--[laughs]

73
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:53,533
LIKE, THIS IS--

74
00:01:53,533 --> 00:01:54,367
>> I MEAN, HE'S CRAZY.

75
00:01:54,367 --> 00:01:55,167
>> THAT'S JUST POINTLESS.

76
00:01:55,167 --> 00:01:56,567
HE DOESN'T EVEN WANT ME, SO--

77
00:01:56,567 --> 00:01:57,967
>> SO YOU DIDN'T HAVE

78
00:01:57,967 --> 00:02:00,267
NO KIND OF ATTACHMENT?

79
00:02:00,267 --> 00:02:02,367
>> NO.

80
00:02:02,367 --> 00:02:04,200
I HAD SOME THOUGHTS ABOUT

81
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,300
ABORTION AT ONE POINT.

82
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,433
THEN I WAS LIKE, "THE MONEY."

83
00:02:07,433 --> 00:02:09,433
>> I DON'T BELIEVE IN ABORTIONS,

84
00:02:09,433 --> 00:02:10,600
BUT I THINK IT'S WORSE TO BRING

85
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,800
A CHILD INTO THE WORLD THAT YOU

86
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,933
CAN'T AFFORD TO FEED.

87
00:02:12,933 --> 00:02:13,633
>> RIGHT.

88
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,500
I FEEL LIKE IT'S ALL

89
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:17,367
GONNA WORK OUT, BUT...

90
00:02:17,367 --> 00:02:18,100
I DON'T KNOW.

91
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:19,100
I KNOW--I JUST ADDED EXTRA

92
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:22,533
RESPONSIBILITY FOR MYSELF.

93
00:02:22,533 --> 00:02:24,800
AND I WISH THAT I WOULD HAVE

94
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,433
GAVE MAUWI A CHANCE BEFORE I

95
00:02:26,433 --> 00:02:29,500
TRIED TO BE REBELLIOUS AND DO

96
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,367
THE TOTAL OPPOSITE.

97
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:32,067
I WISH I WOULD HAVE JUST SAT

98
00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:35,467
DOWN AND REALIZED THAT MAUWI WAS

99
00:02:35,467 --> 00:02:36,567
THE RIGHT PERSON FOR ME TO BE

100
00:02:36,567 --> 00:02:37,433
WITH INSTEAD OF TRYING

101
00:02:37,433 --> 00:02:38,100
TO BE WITH SOMEBODY

102
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:40,667
WHO HAS NO INTEREST IN ME.

103
00:02:40,667 --> 00:02:42,167
IT'S JUST HARD TO GET PAST

104
00:02:42,167 --> 00:02:44,200
THE FACT THAT I'M ABOUT TO

105
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:45,067
HAVE A BABY.

106
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:46,433
LIKE, I STILL HAVEN'T

107
00:02:46,433 --> 00:02:47,100
GOT OVER THAT.

108
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:49,600
I WASN'T SURE IF MAUWI AND I

109
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,100
WERE GONNA LAST ONCE I FOUND OUT

110
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,733
I WAS PREGNANT WITH BABY EDEN.

111
00:02:53,733 --> 00:02:55,067
I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED IN MYSELF

112
00:02:55,067 --> 00:02:56,700
AND WAS SURE HE WOULD BREAK UP

113
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,233
WITH ME, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE

114
00:02:58,233 --> 00:02:59,867
WE HADN'T HAD SEX YET.

115
00:02:59,867 --> 00:03:00,933
AND I TOLD HIM I DIDN'T WANT TO

116
00:03:00,933 --> 00:03:02,300
NOW THAT I WAS PREGNANT

117
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,167
WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S BABY.

118
00:03:04,167 --> 00:03:06,200
BUT MAUWI SAID HE COULD WAIT,

119
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:08,467
AND WE DECIDED TO STAY TOGETHER.

120
00:03:08,467 --> 00:03:09,833
I'M GLAD HE STUCK BY ME.

121
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:10,567
WELL, YOU CAN FEEL HICCUPS

122
00:03:10,567 --> 00:03:11,233
RIGHT HERE.

123
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:11,900
THAT'S ABOUT IT.

124
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:12,567
SEE?

125
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:13,233
>> YEAH.

126
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:13,900
>> HE'S LIKE--

00:03:14,867 --> 00:03:15,867
LIKE, EVERY TWO SECONDS.

129
00:03:15,867 --> 00:03:17,467
I'M LIKE, "OH, MY GOSH."

130
00:03:17,467 --> 00:03:19,633
WHEN YOU FIRST MET ME,

131
00:03:19,633 --> 00:03:20,867
WHAT WAS YOUR IMPRESSION LIKE?

132
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:21,900
>> I THOUGHT YOU WERE CUTE.

133
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,133
BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO JUST,

134
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:24,833
YOU KNOW, JUST STRAIGHT UP

135
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,233
AND JUST START TALKING TO YOU.

136
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:27,067
TRYING TO, YOU KNOW,

137
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:28,100
TAKE MY TIME WITH IT.

138
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:28,800
>> IT'S ALMOST BEEN,

139
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,067
LIKE, A YEAR.

140
00:03:30,067 --> 00:03:31,067
I NEVER THOUGHT OF MYSELF

141
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:33,200
THIS YOUNG IN THIS POSITION.

I PUT OFF ALL THE OPPORTUNITIES

145
00:03:37,367 --> 00:03:38,533
THAT I HAD, YOU KNOW, DEALING

146
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:40,367
WITH MUSIC AND BAND AND

00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:41,633
BASKETBALL AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

00:03:41,633 --> 00:03:42,867
LIKE, NONE OF THOSE

149
00:03:42,867 --> 00:03:44,267
OPPORTUNITIES ARE OPEN.

00:03:44,267 --> 00:03:45,233
>> OPEN, YEAH.

151
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:46,200
>> NO, I MISS PLAYING BASKETBALL

152
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,900
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THE THRILL

AND BE 100% HONEST.

161
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,733
I MEAN, THE AWKWARD SILENCE

INSTEAD OF GOING DOWN THE PATH

169
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:19,367
THAT WE COULD HAVE WENT DOWN.

IT WASN'T LIKE YOU CHEATED ON ME

180
00:04:29,967 --> 00:04:32,533
OR YOU DID SOMETHING CRAZY.

181
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:33,200
ALL THIS HAPPENED

182
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:34,733
BEFORE WE WERE DATING.

183
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:36,833
SO I COULDN'T JUST UP AND LEAVE

184

INTIMATE OR NOTHING LIKE THAT.

277
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:41,333
BUT IT'S REALLY AWKWARD

278
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,267
FOR ME BEING PREGNANT

279
00:06:42,267 --> 00:06:43,633
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE'S BABY.

280
00:06:43,633 --> 00:06:44,833

OUR RELATIONSHIP'S GONNA CHANGE,

WITHOUT MY AUNT'S HELP AND MAUWI

374
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:18,400
BEING AWAY AT SCHOOL,

375
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,433
I'M WORRIED THAT RAISING

376
00:09:19,433 --> 00:09:20,933
THIS BABY IS GONNA BE HARDER

377
00:09:20,933 --> 00:09:22,867
THAN I THOUGHT.

378
00:09:22,867 --> 00:09:24,467
SEEING IT MAKES ME

379
00:09:24,467 --> 00:09:27,067
110% MORE NERVOUS.

380
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,233
>> MAKES IT A LITTLE MORE REAL,

381
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:30,400
RIGHT?

382
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,567
>> I'M TRYING TO PREPARE FOR

383
00:09:31,567 --> 00:09:33,067
EDEN AND STAY ON TOP OF MY

384
00:09:33,067 --> 00:09:34,633
SCHOOLWORK, BUT I NEED TO

385
00:09:34,633 --> 00:09:36,667
FIND A JOB TOO.

386
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:37,633
>> I MEAN, IF I WAS YOU GOING

387
00:09:37,633 --> 00:09:38,967
IN TO A JOB, I WOULDN'T TELL 'EM

388
00:09:38,967 --> 00:09:39,700
I'M PREGNANT.

389
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,400
'CAUSE TO MOST PEOPLE, IT'S

390
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,900
GONNA TELL THEM, OH, YOU GONNA

391
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,800
HAVE ISSUES WITH BABYSITTING.

392
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,633
IT'S TOO MUCH RESPONSIBILITY;

393
00:09:46,633 --> 00:09:47,633
YOU WON'T BE RELIABLE.

394
00:09:47,633 --> 00:09:50,567
SO I WOULDN'T BRING THAT UP

395
00:09:50,567 --> 00:09:54,767
IN THE CONVERSATION AT ALL.

396
00:09:54,767 --> 00:09:55,467
>> SHOULD I BUTTON IT?

397
00:09:55,467 --> 00:09:56,367
>> YEAH.

398
00:09:56,367 --> 00:09:57,367
I THINK YOU'LL GET BY

399
00:09:57,367 --> 00:09:58,533
IF YOU KEEP YOUR COAT ON.

400
00:09:58,533 --> 00:10:00,300
YOU JUST LOOK A LITTLE CHUNKY.

401
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,300
BUT YOU CAN'T REALLY TELL

402
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:04,133
YOU'RE PREGNANT.

403
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:05,967
YEAH, YOU'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

404
00:10:05,967 --> 00:10:07,967
ALL RIGHTY, THEN. LET'S GO.

405
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,133
>> HI.

406
00:10:19,133 --> 00:10:19,900
I WAS WONDERING

407
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:20,967
IF YOU GUYS WERE HIRING.

408
00:10:20,967 --> 00:10:21,633
>> OKAY, I GOT TO

409
00:10:21,633 --> 00:10:22,533
GET APPLICATION.

410
00:10:22,533 --> 00:10:23,200
>> OKAY.

411
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:25,200
>> RIGHT?

412
00:10:31,267 --> 00:10:31,933
>> HAVE YOU WORKED IN

413
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:33,700
RESTAURANTS BEFORE?

414
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,167
>> I HAVE NOT, BUT I DO HAVE A

415
00:10:35,167 --> 00:10:37,000
LITTLE EXPERIENCE WITH WORKING.

416
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,000
>> OKAY.

417
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:42,567
>> HOW CAN I HELP YOU?

418
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:44,467
>> HI, I WAS TRYING TO SEE, YOU

419
00:10:44,467 --> 00:10:45,300
KNOW, IF YOU GUYS WERE HIRING,

420
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,500
AND IF SO, I CAN FILL OUT

421
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,133
AN APPLICATION.

422
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:49,167
>> WHAT KIND OF A JOB

423
00:10:49,167 --> 00:10:50,400
ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

424
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,567
>> UM...

425
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:53,667
SOMETHING RELAXING.

426
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:55,167
>> PLAY ANY MUSICAL INSTRUMENT?

427
00:10:55,167 --> 00:10:56,367
>> UM, I CURRENTLY PLAY, LIKE,

428
00:10:56,367 --> 00:10:58,067
THE PIANO AND GUITAR AND DRUMS.

429
00:10:58,067 --> 00:10:59,233
>> GUITAR. MM-HMM.

430
00:10:59,233 --> 00:10:59,900
BUT I CAN GIVE YOU

431
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,900
AN APPLICATION TODAY.

432
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,133
YOU JUST FILL IT OUT.

433
00:11:02,133 --> 00:11:03,067
>> ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

434
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:05,233
>> OKAY.

435
00:11:05,233 --> 00:11:07,967
[engine turns over]

436
00:11:07,967 --> 00:11:10,233
>> HOW DID THE LAST SHOP FEEL?

437
00:11:10,233 --> 00:11:11,200
>> UM, IT WAS A BETTER

438
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,733
ENVIRONMENT, LIKE, IT WAS MORE

439
00:11:12,733 --> 00:11:14,067
OF A STORE THAT I WOULD BE INTO.

440
00:11:14,067 --> 00:11:15,633
AND I'M JUST GONNA HOPE

441
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:16,600
FOR THE BEST, I GUESS.

442
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,800
>> GOOD YOU'RE TRYING, BUT I'M

443
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:18,867
NOT GONNA SIT THERE AND TELL YOU

444
00:11:18,867 --> 00:11:19,633
I'M EXCITED.

445
00:11:19,633 --> 00:11:22,133
I'LL BE HAPPY WHEN YOU GET ONE.

446
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:23,467
[laughs]

447
00:11:23,467 --> 00:11:25,067
I'M JUST BEING HONEST.

448
00:11:25,067 --> 00:11:26,133
THIS IS WHAT I'LL DO

449
00:11:26,133 --> 00:11:27,800
WHEN YOU SAY, "AUNTIE,

450
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,800
I GOT A JOB."

451
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,733
I'LL DO THAT.

452
00:11:33,733 --> 00:11:34,967
>> WITH SO MUCH ON MY MIND,

453
00:11:34,967 --> 00:11:36,800
IT'S HARD TO CONCENTRATE.

454
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:37,567
AND I'M NOT GETTING MUCH

455
00:11:37,567 --> 00:11:43,067
SCHOOLWORK DONE.

456
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:43,733
>> I WON'T SPILL.

457
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:44,400
>> NUH-UH.

458
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,567
I'M SCARED OF HEIGHTS.

459
00:11:45,567 --> 00:11:46,733
I CAN'T SIT RIGHT HERE.

460
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:47,400
MM-MM.

461
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:51,067
NO.

462
00:11:51,067 --> 00:11:52,567
I'VE BEEN PREGNANT FOR A YEAR.

463
00:11:52,567 --> 00:11:53,933
I DON'T CARE WHAT NOBODY SAY.

464
00:11:53,933 --> 00:11:55,767
I'VE BEEN PREGNANT FOREVER.

465
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:56,667
I DON'T SEE HOW PEOPLE GET

466
00:11:56,667 --> 00:11:57,767
PREGNANT AND JUST HAVE, LIKE,

467
00:11:57,767 --> 00:11:58,900
SIX, SEVEN KIDS.

468
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,300
THAT IS YOUR LIFE.

469
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,167
YOU IS OLD AND DRIED UP

470
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:03,333
AFTER THEM KIDS.

471
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,900
>> WELL, ARE YOU READY

472
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,967
SINCE IT'S SO CLOSE?

473
00:12:05,967 --> 00:12:06,700
YOU DON'T HAVE

474
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:07,733
THAT MUCH TIME LEFT.

475
00:12:07,733 --> 00:12:09,333
>> I MEAN, BASICALLY I JUST

476
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:10,733
GOT TO GET EVERYTHING TOGETHER

477
00:12:10,733 --> 00:12:13,600
AND MENTALLY PREPARE MYSELF.

478
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:14,567
BUT THEN I'M JUST LIKE,

479
00:12:14,567 --> 00:12:15,633
"I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING."

480
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:16,467
LIKE, I DON'T EVEN

481
00:12:16,467 --> 00:12:17,433
HAVE AN OVERNIGHT BAG.

482
00:12:17,433 --> 00:12:18,367
>> LIKE, I'M NOT READY FOR THIS.

483
00:12:18,367 --> 00:12:18,967
>> [laughs]

484
00:12:18,967 --> 00:12:20,067
LIKE, I'M JUST LIKE,

485
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:21,567
"I REALLY HOPE THIS BABY

486
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:22,267
DON'T COME TONIGHT,

487
00:12:22,267 --> 00:12:24,133
'CAUSE I DON'T HAVE NOTHING."

488
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:26,300
SO WHENEVER MY AUNT IS LIKE,

489
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,967
YOU KNOW, I GUESS DRILLING ME

490
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:29,533
ABOUT WHAT I NEED TO DO,

491
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:30,500
IT MAKES ME REALIZE

492
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,300
THAT I'VE BEEN SITTING AROUND

493
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,733
NOT DOING WHAT I NEEDED TO DO.

494
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:35,567
>> HOW HAVE THINGS BEEN?

495
00:12:35,567 --> 00:12:36,400
WITH YOU AND MAUWI?

496
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,500
>> WELL, HE JUST STARTED

497
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,700
BACK AT SCHOOL, SO WE ONLY

498
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,900
SEE EACH OTHER ON WEEKENDS,

499
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,067
BUT OTHER THAN THAT, I MEAN,

500
00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:42,100
THINGS ARE GOOD.

501
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:42,800
I'M ABOUT TO SEE HIM

502
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,567
LATER TODAY.

503
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:44,500
>> SO HOW DO YOU THINK IT'S

504
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,233
GONNA BE LIKE AFTER THE BABY?

505
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:47,433
>> I MEAN, AFTER THE BABY,

506
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,900
BECAUSE I'LL BE ABLE TO MOVE

507
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,733
AROUND AND BE MORE OF MYSELF,

508
00:12:51,733 --> 00:12:53,067
YOU KNOW.

509
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:53,833
THEN I THINK THINGS

510
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:55,133
WILL GO BACK TO NORMAL, BUT IT'S

511
00:12:55,133 --> 00:12:56,567
NOT GONNA BE COMPLETELY NORMAL,

512
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:59,233
'CAUSE I HAVE A BABY.

513
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:00,300
I HATE SEX.

514
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:01,633
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS.

515
00:13:01,633 --> 00:13:02,567
[laughter]

516
00:13:02,567 --> 00:13:03,467
>> DID YOU AND MAUWI

517
00:13:03,467 --> 00:13:04,500
EVER HAVE SEX?

518
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,900
>> ABSOLUTELY NOT.

519
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:06,800
I DON'T KNOW.

520
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,100
IT'S GONNA TAKE ME A WHILE TO

521
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,333
GET BACK AROUND TO IT, BECAUSE

522
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,367
I'VE HAD SUCH A HORRIBLE

523
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:13,467
EXPERIENCE WITH SEX.

524
00:13:13,467 --> 00:13:14,967
FIRST OF ALL, WITH THE WRONG

525
00:13:14,967 --> 00:13:18,133
PERSON, AND THEN YOU GET A BABY

526
00:13:18,133 --> 00:13:18,800
OUT OF IT.

527
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,967
YOU JUST KIND OF LIKE, "THAT IS

528
00:13:20,967 --> 00:13:21,967
THE LAST THING ON MY MIND.

529
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:22,800
I DO NOT CARE."

530
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,633
>> YEAH.

531
00:13:24,633 --> 00:13:25,700
>> I MEAN, IF I NEVER HAVE SEX

532
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,767
AGAIN, I WOULDN'T CARE.

533
00:13:26,767 --> 00:13:27,467
[both laugh]

534
00:13:27,467 --> 00:13:28,667
I REALLY WOULDN'T.

535
00:13:28,667 --> 00:13:31,300
>> YOU THINK MAUWI WOULD, LIKE,

536
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,467
FEEL LIKE YOU'RE BLAMING HIM OR

537
00:13:33,467 --> 00:13:35,967
PUNISHING HIM FOR WHAT ELI DID?

538
00:13:35,967 --> 00:13:36,733
>> YEAH.

539
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:37,400
IN SOME SENSE,

540
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,733
I FEEL LIKE HE COULD--

541
00:13:38,733 --> 00:13:40,233
HE COULD TAKE IT THAT WAY.

542
00:13:40,233 --> 00:13:42,400
BUT IT'LL BE A WHILE.

543
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,133
>> YEAH.

544
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:44,733
>> AND IF HE'S WILLING TO, LIKE,

545
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:45,600
WAIT THAT TIME,

546
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,900
THEN IT'S UP TO HIM.

547
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:51,733
>> YEAH.

548
00:13:51,733 --> 00:13:53,300
>> MAUWI IS HOME THIS WEEKEND,

549
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,833
SO MY AUNT WANTS TO TALK TO US

550
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:55,667
ABOUT OUR PLAN

551
00:13:55,667 --> 00:13:57,167
FOR WHEN EDEN GETS HERE.

552
00:13:57,167 --> 00:13:57,833
>> WHAT'S UP?

553
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:58,900
>> WHAT'S GOOD, BRO?

554
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,900
>> both: HEY, MAUWI.

555
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,133
>> HOW Y'ALL DOING?

556
00:14:01,133 --> 00:14:01,800
>> GOOD.

557
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,800
YOU WANT SOMETHING TO EAT?

558
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,467
>> YEAH.

I DON'T HAVE ANY EXPECTATIONS,

577
00:14:23,633 --> 00:14:25,800

578
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,067
YOU'RE NOT THE FATHER.

579
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:30,067

LIKE, WHEN THE BABY GETS HERE

598
00:14:55,567 --> 00:14:57,900

00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,767
[chime dings]

749
00:18:53,767 --> 00:18:54,600
>> OF COURSE I'M REALLY

750
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,133
ATTRACTED TO MAUWI, BUT BEING

751
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:57,267
PREGNANT WITH SOMEONE ELSE'S

752
00:18:57,267 --> 00:18:59,167
BABY IS SO AWKWARD FOR ME

753
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:00,233
THAT I ALWAYS STOP THINGS

754
00:19:00,233 --> 00:19:01,733
FROM GOING TOO FAR.

755
00:19:01,733 --> 00:19:03,333
BUT LAST NIGHT, IT STARTED

756
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,400
TO CAUSE MORE TENSION.

757
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:11,500
AFTER THIS EXPERIENCE, I DON'T

758
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:13,733
EVEN WANT TO HAVE NO MORE KIDS.

759
00:19:13,733 --> 00:19:14,967
>> I FEEL YOU.

760
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:15,633
>> I'M PUTTING ON

761
00:19:15,633 --> 00:19:17,067
A CHASTITY BELT.

762
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:18,067
>> YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO HAVE SEX

763
00:19:18,067 --> 00:19:19,267
OR NOTHING AFTER HE POPS OUT?

764
00:19:19,267 --> 00:19:21,400
>> NOPE. NOPE.

765
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,233
>> EVER?

766
00:19:22,233 --> 00:19:23,600
>> I'M TRAUMATIZED.

767
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,900
>> TRAUMATIZED.

768
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,133
>> AFTER HAVING A BABY, LIKE,

769
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:29,367
WITH SOMEBODY THAT YOU DON'T

770
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:32,300
EVEN KNOW, I DON'T--

771
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,233
>> BUT I'M NOT HIM.

772
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:34,900
>> RIGHT.

773
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,967
>> YOU KNOW ME.

774
00:19:35,967 --> 00:19:36,900
IT'S A WHOLE DIFFERENT SCENARIO.

775
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:37,767
>> IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME FOR ME

776
00:19:37,767 --> 00:19:39,233
TO GET OVER THAT.

777
00:19:39,233 --> 00:19:40,567
>> MAN, THAT'S--THAT'S

778
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:42,667
EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING.

779
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:44,067
'CAUSE, LIKE, I'M IN COLLEGE.

780
00:19:44,067 --> 00:19:45,333
I'M PLAYING FOOTBALL.

781
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:47,900
AND WHEN I GO OUT, OF COURSE,

782
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:50,067
FEMALES TRY TO HOOK UP WITH ME

783
00:19:50,067 --> 00:19:51,133
AND DO STUFF WITH ME.

784
00:19:51,133 --> 00:19:51,800
BUT IT'S LIKE,

785
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:52,500
"OH, I GOT A GIRLFRIEND.

786
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,133
I CAN'T DEAL.

787
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:54,067
I GOT A GIRL BACK HOME.

788
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:54,833
YOU KNOW, WHATEVER, BUT I'M

789
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:55,667
GOING TO SEE MY GIRL.

790
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:56,667
EVERYTHING I WANT TO DO,

791
00:19:56,667 --> 00:19:58,067
I'MA DO IT WITH HER."

792
00:19:58,067 --> 00:19:59,067
I CAN'T SAY THAT.

793
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:01,033
>> OH.

794
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:01,800
I DON'T--[laughs]

795
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,833
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO BE

796
00:20:02,833 --> 00:20:04,567
DISCUSSING STUFF LIKE THIS.

797
00:20:04,567 --> 00:20:05,967
I NEED A DAMN CAR SEAT.

798
00:20:05,967 --> 00:20:07,033
I MEAN, IT MIGHT BE FRUSTRATING

799
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:07,700
FOR YOU, BUT--

800
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:08,500
>> YEAH, IT'S FRUSTRATING

801
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,100
FOR ME.

802
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,267
>> YOU NOT PREGENET, SO--

803
00:20:11,267 --> 00:20:11,933
>> I'M NOT WHAT?

804
00:20:11,933 --> 00:20:13,000
>> YOU'RE NOT PREGENET.

805
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,933
>> I'M NOT PREGNANT?

806
00:20:13,933 --> 00:20:14,600
>> I MEAN--

807
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:16,000
>> NOW, THAT SOUNDS PERSONAL.

808
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,833
'CAUSE NOBODY TOLD YOU

809
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,167
TO POP UP PREGNANT.

810
00:20:18,167 --> 00:20:19,400
THAT'S WHY PEOPLE USE, YOU KNOW,

811
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,667
CONDOMS.

812
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:22,133
THEY DID INVENT THOSE TO

813
00:20:22,133 --> 00:20:24,333
PREVENT STUFF LIKE THIS.

814
00:20:29,733 --> 00:20:30,800
>> I MEAN, MY ORIGINAL PLAN

815
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,833
WAS TO WAIT TILL

816
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:33,200
I GOT MARRIED ANYWAYS.

817
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,667
>> UH...BUT YOU DIDN'T DO THAT.

818
00:20:34,667 --> 00:20:35,333
>> OKAY.

819
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,333
>> THAT'S MY THING.

820
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,433
>> [sighs]

821
00:20:47,633 --> 00:20:49,167
>> SO, SAVON...

822
00:20:49,167 --> 00:20:50,000
>> MM-HMM.

823
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:50,700
>> YOU AND MAUWI

824
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,633
GOT INTO IT TODAY?

825
00:20:51,633 --> 00:20:52,300
>> HE DID HAVE

826
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,000
A LITTLE ATTITUDE TODAY.

827
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:53,900
>> HE DID?

828
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:55,233
HOW Y'ALL RELATIONSHIP GONNA

829
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:56,667
WORK OUT?

830
00:20:56,667 --> 00:20:57,333
>> I DON'T KNOW.

831
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:58,133
IT'S NOT LOOKING TOO GOOD

832
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,100
RIGHT NOW, HONESTLY.

833
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,067
>> HEY, I MEAN, YOU AND MAUWI

834
00:21:00,067 --> 00:21:00,967
AIN'T NEVER EVEN BEEN INTIMATE,

835
00:21:00,967 --> 00:21:01,633
RIGHT?

836
00:21:01,633 --> 00:21:02,300
>> RIGHT.

837
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,567
I'M MAKING SURE I'M, LIKE,

838
00:21:03,567 --> 00:21:05,067
TRYING TO GET EVERYTHING BEFORE,

839
00:21:05,067 --> 00:21:06,067
YOU KNOW, THE BABY GETS HERE AND

840
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:07,867
MAKE SURE EVERYTHING IS SETTLED.

841
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:10,067
SEX IS REALLY NOT--

842
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:10,833
>> SO WHY DO YOU HAVE

843
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:11,900
A BOYFRIEND?

844
00:21:11,900 --> 00:21:12,900
>> I MEAN--

845
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,067
>> I MEAN, I'M JUST TRYING TO--

846
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:15,567
>> THIS WAS BEFORE I KNEW.

847
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:17,067
I MEAN, EVENTUALLY, IF YOU GET

848
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:17,900
WITH SOMEBODY AND YOU DON'T KNOW

849
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,567
YOU PREGNANT--

850
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:19,733
>> BUT YOU DIDN'T MAKE ELI

851
00:21:19,733 --> 00:21:20,700
WAIT THAT LONG.

852
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,233
I MEAN, YOU HAD A CHAN--

853
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:23,333
YOU BECAME AN ANGEL

854
00:21:23,333 --> 00:21:24,400
AFTER YOU GOT PREGNANT?

855
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,233
>> NO, I'M SAYING--

856
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:26,100
WHAT I'M SAYING IS,

857
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,800
WHEN I GOT WITH MAUWI,

858
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,733
THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED

859
00:21:28,733 --> 00:21:29,733
THAT I WAS PREGNANT.

860
00:21:29,733 --> 00:21:30,833
SO I--WE REALLY DIDN'T HAVE A

861
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,633
CHANCE TO EVEN BE INTIMATE.

862
00:21:32,633 --> 00:21:34,233
>> WHAT YOU LIKE ABOUT MAUWI?

863
00:21:34,233 --> 00:21:36,300
>> I MEAN, HE'S A GOOD PERSON,

864
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,433
LIKE, GENUINELY, LIKE, FROM THE

865
00:21:37,433 --> 00:21:38,800
HEART, LIKE, WHENEVER HE DOES

866
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,567
SOMETHING, IT'S HONEST.

867
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:42,500
>> DO YOU WANT TO BE INTIMATE

868
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,333
WITH HIM?

869
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:44,333
>> EVENTUALLY.

870
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,767
BUT NOT AT THE MOMENT.

871
00:21:45,767 --> 00:21:47,767
THE SITUATION IS ALREADY

872
00:21:47,767 --> 00:21:49,833
COMPLICATED AND AWKWARD.

873
00:21:49,833 --> 00:21:51,567
I'M PREGNANT, AND THERE'S

874
00:21:51,567 --> 00:21:52,767
OTHER RESPONSIBILITIES

875
00:21:52,767 --> 00:21:53,933
I GOT TO TAKE ON NOW.

876
00:21:53,933 --> 00:21:55,133
>> YOU'RE NOT GONNA PICK A MAN--

877
00:21:55,133 --> 00:21:56,833
CHOOSE A MAN OVER YOUR KIDS.

878
00:21:56,833 --> 00:21:58,500
YOUR KIDS GONNA ALWAYS BE

879
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,100
THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY.

880
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,233
YOUR FOCUS GOT TO BE ON YOURSELF

881
00:22:02,233 --> 00:22:03,733
AND YOUR SON TO MAKE A BETTER

882
00:22:03,733 --> 00:22:04,967
LIFE FOR HIM.

883
00:22:04,967 --> 00:22:06,067
>> YEAH.

884
00:22:06,067 --> 00:22:07,333
WELL, I UNDERSTAND THAT.

885
00:22:07,333 --> 00:22:09,333
SO--

886
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:14,067
I'M DUE IN A WEEK, AND WE'RE

887
00:22:14,067 --> 00:22:16,400
HAVING A CRAZY ICE STORM.

888
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,667
MAUWI AND I HAVEN'T TALKED

889
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:18,567
SINCE OUR ARGUMENT,

890
00:22:18,567 --> 00:22:20,067
AND HE'S BACK AT SCHOOL.

891
00:22:20,067 --> 00:22:21,400
MY AUNT'S OUT OF TOWN VISITING

892
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,900
A FRIEND, AND I'M AT HOME

893
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,067
WITH MY COUSIN PHILIP.

894
00:22:24,067 --> 00:22:25,133
BUT WHILE I WAS TRYING TO

895
00:22:25,133 --> 00:22:26,367
GET CAUGHT UP ON SCHOOLWORK,

896
00:22:26,367 --> 00:22:27,233
I STARTED TO FEEL

897
00:22:27,233 --> 00:22:28,533
SOME INTENSE CRAMPS.

898
00:22:28,533 --> 00:22:31,233
[grunts]

899
00:22:31,233 --> 00:22:32,167
MY BOOTY IS, LIKE,

900
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:33,400
REALLY HURTING.

901
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,233
>> ARE YOU GONNA CALL

902
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:35,300
YOUR BOYFRIEND?

903
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,733
>> I'M NOT CALLING ANYBODY

904
00:22:36,733 --> 00:22:38,733
UNTIL THE BABY'S BORN.

905
00:22:41,267 --> 00:22:42,667
>> YOU IN PAIN?

906
00:22:42,667 --> 00:22:44,767
>> UH, YEAH, I MEAN,

907
00:22:44,767 --> 00:22:46,433
IT WENT FROM JUST, LIKE,

908
00:22:46,433 --> 00:22:47,533
A LITTLE PRESSURE TO, LIKE,

909
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:50,667
IT'S LIKE REALLY BAD, SHARP.

910
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:55,833
>> ALL RIGHT.

911
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,500
>> BYE.

912
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,567
>> SO BASICALLY, MAMA CAN'T

913
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:00,800
GET IN THE STATE OF GEORGIA

914
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,733
RIGHT NOW.

915
00:23:02,733 --> 00:23:04,333
SO SHE'S STUCK.

916
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:05,067
>> YEP.

917
00:23:05,067 --> 00:23:07,233
WELL, I GUESS WE JUST WAIT.

918
00:23:07,233 --> 00:23:10,633
BUT MY CONTRACTIONS GOT WORSE.

919
00:23:10,633 --> 00:23:11,667
AND SINCE MY AUNT WAS STUCK OUT

920
00:23:11,667 --> 00:23:13,367
OF TOWN AND IT WAS TOO DANGEROUS

921
00:23:13,367 --> 00:23:14,967
TO TAKE A TAXI IN THE STORM, MY

922
00:23:14,967 --> 00:23:16,733
COUSIN HAD TO CALL AN AMBULANCE

923
00:23:16,733 --> 00:23:20,300
TO TAKE ME TO THE HOSPITAL.

924
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:21,733
WHEN I GOT TO THE HOSPITAL,

925
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:23,567
THINGS MOVED PRETTY QUICKLY.

926
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:24,733
THE DOCTOR SAID I WAS ALREADY

927
00:23:24,733 --> 00:23:26,400
6 CENTIMETERS, SO I GOT

928
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,200
AN EPIDURAL RIGHT AWAY.

929
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:28,867
>> WELL, IT LOOK LIKE

930
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:32,733
TODAY IS THE DAY.

931
00:23:32,733 --> 00:23:34,067
HOW YOU FEELING?

932
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:36,067
>> MY LEGS ARE COMPLETELY NUMB.

933
00:23:36,067 --> 00:23:36,733

1122
00:29:53,433 --> 00:29:57,433
IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS.

1123

I JUST WONDER WHAT TOOK YOU SO

LONG TO COME TO THIS CONCLUSION

1128
00:30:04,667 --> 00:30:05,600
IN LIFE.

1129
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,933
I DON'T LIKE,

1130
00:30:06,933 --> 00:30:09,700
YOU KNOW, WASTING TIME.

1131
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:11,200
TIME IS VERY PRECIOUS,

1132
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,000
SOMETHING YOU CAN'T GET BACK.

1134
00:30:14,767 --> 00:30:18,200
I WOULDN'T HAVE KEPT STRINGING

1135
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:18,900

LIKE, OH, WE CAN WORK IT OUT.

1137
00:30:20,733 --> 00:30:21,400
MY MIND-SET

1138
00:30:21,400 --> 00:30:22,300
IS TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

1139
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,200
I'M THINKING LIKE A MOTHER,

1140
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,867
NOT AS A GIRLFRIEND.

1141
00:30:28,867 --> 00:30:29,800
>> I MEAN, I DON'T HAVE

1142
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,533
ANYTHING ELSE TO ACCEPT OR--

1143
00:30:32,533 --> 00:30:34,467
I DON'T HAVE NO CHOICE.

1144
00:30:34,467 --> 00:30:36,100
THE PROOF IS IN FRONT OF ME.

COMES ALONG WITH IT.

1178
00:31:50,433 --> 00:31:52,767
TO MAKE THIS DECISION?

EVENTUALLY,

WE WOULD HAVE GROWN APART.

IF NOT NOW, IT WOULD HAVE

1183
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:01,433
BEEN LATER ON, AND WE BOTH

1184
00:32:01,433 --> 00:32:02,433
WOULD BE LIKE, "WELL,

WAS NOT GONNA WORK.

1190
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,500
OR DO YOU THINK

1191
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:14,500
YOU'RE GONNA BE LONELY?

00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:25,267
I FINALLY GOT A JOB,

1195
00:32:25,267 --> 00:32:26,700
AND MY FRIEND AGREED TO BABYSIT

00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:43,267
WAKES UP SO OFTEN.

1306
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:44,333
I HAVE TO GO IN THERE,

1307
00:36:44,333 --> 00:36:46,200
FEED HIM, WAIT FOR HIM

1308
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,067
TO BURP, FEED HIM AGAIN.

1309
00:36:48,067 --> 00:36:49,433
I'M LIKE, "I HAVE THINGS TO DO,

1310
00:36:49,433 --> 00:36:50,100
OKAY?"

1311
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,100
>> SO HE ALREADY GOT YOU

1312
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,267
LOOKING LIKE A PUPPET,

1313
00:36:52,267 --> 00:36:53,433
AND HE CAN'T EVEN TALK YET.

1314
00:36:53,433 --> 00:36:54,267
>> YEP.

1315
00:36:54,267 --> 00:36:56,933
>> [laughs]

1316
00:36:56,933 --> 00:36:59,100
>> I WAS JUST THINKING ABOUT

1317
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:02,500
HOW EVERYTHING IS, LIKE,

1318
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:03,667
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

1319
00:37:03,667 --> 00:37:04,800
LIKE, I MEAN, YOU STILL DOING

1320
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:05,800
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO FOR THE MOST

1321
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,833
PART, BUT FOR ME, IT'S LIKE--

1322
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:09,333
LIKE, YOU CAN DO SPORT--YOU CAN

1323
00:37:09,333 --> 00:37:10,167
GO TO COLLEGE FOR SPORTS,

1324
00:37:10,167 --> 00:37:11,167
BUT IF I GO TO COLLEGE,

1325
00:37:11,167 --> 00:37:12,067
IT WON'T BE--

1326
00:37:12,067 --> 00:37:13,067
I MEAN, THAT'S GONNA BE

1327
00:37:13,067 --> 00:37:15,867
TOO TIME-CONSUMING FOR ME.

1328
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:17,167
>> BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

1329
00:37:17,167 --> 00:37:18,067
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO DO IT,

1330
00:37:18,067 --> 00:37:19,833
YOU CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN.

1331
00:37:19,833 --> 00:37:20,667
>> YEAH.

1332
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:22,167
TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THE THINGS

1333
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:22,833
THAT I WANT TO DO,

1334
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:24,267
LIKE BASKETBALL AND MUSIC,

1335
00:37:24,267 --> 00:37:25,433
I MEAN, IT'S GONNA BE HARD.

1336
00:37:25,433 --> 00:37:27,500
>> YOU'RE NOT A 40-YEAR-OLD

1337
00:37:27,500 --> 00:37:28,267
WOMAN.

1338
00:37:28,267 --> 00:37:30,733
LIKE, YOU'RE NOT EVEN 20 YET.

1339
00:37:30,733 --> 00:37:32,433
YOU STILL GOT MORE THAN ENOUGH

1340
00:37:32,433 --> 00:37:34,833
TIME TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN.

1341
00:37:34,833 --> 00:37:36,500
>> IT WASN'T WHAT I HAD PLANNED

1342
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,167
FOR MY LIFE.

1343
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:39,333
BUT I JUST HAVE TO ROLL

1344
00:37:39,333 --> 00:37:41,067
WITH THE PUNCHES, REALLY.

1345
00:37:41,067 --> 00:37:44,067
JUST LIVE DAY-BY-DAY.

1346
00:37:44,067 --> 00:37:44,667
>> I FEEL YOU.

1347
00:37:44,667 --> 00:37:45,400
THAT'S THE ONLY THING

1348
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:46,067
YOU CAN DO.

1349
00:37:46,067 --> 00:37:49,333
>> YEP.

1350
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:50,633
I MEAN, IT'S NICE THAT WE STILL

1351
00:37:50,633 --> 00:37:52,667
CAN BE FRIENDS EVEN AFTER,

1352
00:37:52,667 --> 00:37:54,800
YOU KNOW, BREAKING UP.

1353
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:55,467
BUT--

1354
00:37:55,467 --> 00:37:57,500
>> YEAH.

1355
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,833
I MEAN, IT'S LIFE.

1356
00:37:58,833 --> 00:37:59,500
>> YEAH.

1357
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:02,133
MY BOYFRIEND IS ONE MONTH.

1358
00:38:02,133 --> 00:38:04,567
I FEED HIM EVERY DAY,

1359
00:38:04,567 --> 00:38:05,967
AND I CHANGE HIS DIAPER.

1360
00:38:05,967 --> 00:38:07,233
AND THAT'S MY BOYFRIEND.

1361
00:38:07,233 --> 00:38:08,733
THAT'S MY LIFE.

1362
00:38:08,733 --> 00:38:09,467
>> OUR FRIENDSHIP

1363
00:38:09,467 --> 00:38:10,400
IS NEVER GONNA END.

1364
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,067
>> IS THAT RIGHT?

1365
00:38:11,067 --> 00:38:11,767
>> YEAH, I'M ALWAYS

1366
00:38:11,767 --> 00:38:12,433
GONNA BE AROUND.

1367
00:38:12,433 --> 00:38:13,300
YOU AIN'T GONNA HAVE NO CHOICE

1368
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:13,933
BUT TO BE MY FRIEND,

1369
00:38:13,933 --> 00:38:15,233
WHETHER YOU LOVE ME OR HATE ME.

1370
00:38:15,233 --> 00:38:18,800
[geese honking]

1371
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,433
>> OH, HELL NO.

1372
00:38:20,433 --> 00:38:22,067
I DON'T LIKE THIS [bleep].

1373
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:24,167
>> THEY TRYING TO JUMP US.

1374
00:38:24,167 --> 00:38:25,333
>> IS THIS SAFE?

1375
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:26,933
I'VE BEEN ATTACKED BY A DUCK,

1376
00:38:26,933 --> 00:38:27,867
AND I DON'T LIKE IT,

1377
00:38:27,867 --> 00:38:28,667
SO IT'S LIKE--

1378
00:38:28,667 --> 00:38:29,733
>> WANT ME TO SCARE THEM AWAY?

1379
00:38:29,733 --> 00:38:31,500
I DON'T TRUST DUCKS, THOUGH.

1380
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,333
>> [laughs]

1381
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:34,333
>> GET BACK.

1382
00:38:40,833 --> 00:38:41,833
>> I WOULD HAVE NEVER THOUGHT

1383
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:42,767
I WOULD BE A TEEN MOM

1384
00:38:42,767 --> 00:38:43,500
BECAUSE OF THE WAY

1385
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,433
THAT I WAS RAISED.

1386
00:38:45,433 --> 00:38:47,067
I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED

1387
00:38:47,067 --> 00:38:48,467
IN MYSELF.

1388
00:38:48,467 --> 00:38:49,833
DON'T RUN UP ON THE WRONG ONE.

1389
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:50,533
[laughs]

1390
00:38:50,533 --> 00:38:51,333
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

1391
00:38:51,333 --> 00:38:52,333
[laughs]

1392
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:53,333
SO I'M BEING CAUTIOUS.

1393
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:54,833
>> [laughs]

1394
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,067
OH, OOH!

1395
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:56,900
>> SIT BACK DOWN.

1396
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:58,133
ACT LIKE THIS NEVER HAPPENED.

1397
00:38:58,133 --> 00:38:59,167
>> BEFORE I GOT PREGNANT,

1398
00:38:59,167 --> 00:39:00,567
I WAS FOCUSED IN SCHOOL.

1399
00:39:00,567 --> 00:39:02,300
I HAD GOOD GRADES.

1400
00:39:02,300 --> 00:39:04,767
I WAS ON THE BASKETBALL TEAM.

1401
00:39:04,767 --> 00:39:06,467
BUT I FEEL LIKE AFTER I GOT

1402
00:39:06,467 --> 00:39:08,400
PREGNANT, ALL THOSE THINGS

1403
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:10,867
KIND OF WENT AWAY.

1404
00:39:10,867 --> 00:39:12,900
>> YOU HUNGRY, LITTLE MAN?

1405
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:15,833
>> MY AUNT HAS HELPED ME A LOT.

1406
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:17,667
SHE TOOK ME IN, SHE HELPED ME

1407
00:39:17,667 --> 00:39:20,333
RAISE EDEN THE BEST THAT I CAN.

1408
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:22,067
I ALWAYS THOUGHT WHEN I HAD A

1409
00:39:22,067 --> 00:39:23,267
BABY, THAT THE FATHER WOULD BE

1410
00:39:23,267 --> 00:39:24,133
THERE AND IT WOULD BE

1411
00:39:24,133 --> 00:39:25,533
A COUPLE THING AND WE WOULD

1412
00:39:25,533 --> 00:39:26,833
RAISE THE CHILD TOGETHER.

1413
00:39:26,833 --> 00:39:28,267
THEN I REALIZED, YOU KNOW,

1414
00:39:28,267 --> 00:39:29,333
"I'M HAVING A BABY,

1415
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:30,300
AND I'M BY MYSELF."

1416
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,067
IT'S JUST ME.

1417
00:39:32,067 --> 00:39:34,167
EVERYTHING JUST KIND OF CAME TO

1418
00:39:34,167 --> 00:39:36,667
ME, HIT ME ALL AT ONCE.

1419
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:37,600
EDEN'S FATHER

1420
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,733
HAS NOT CAME BY ONCE

1421
00:39:38,733 --> 00:39:40,400
TO SEE HIS SON.

1422
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:42,600
IT WAS HARD TO LET MAUWI GO

1423
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,067
AS A BOYFRIEND,

1424
00:39:44,067 --> 00:39:46,167
BUT HE'S STILL A FRIEND.

1425
00:39:46,167 --> 00:39:47,167
I WANT TO START COLLEGE

1426
00:39:47,167 --> 00:39:48,167
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

1427
00:39:48,167 --> 00:39:50,433
I JUST FEEL LIKE GETTING MY GED

1428
00:39:50,433 --> 00:39:52,833
WILL BE A BETTER OPTION FOR ME

1429
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:54,167
TO HAVE MORE TIME FOR EDEN

1430
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:56,333
AND PUT TOWARDS MY CAREER.

1431
00:39:56,333 --> 00:39:57,900
HI, EVERYBODY, I'M SAVON.

1432
00:39:57,900 --> 00:39:59,067
I'M GONNA BE SINGING

1433
00:39:59,067 --> 00:40:00,300
SOMETHING ORIGINAL.

1434
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,933
I WANT A CAREER IN MUSIC,

1435
00:40:01,933 --> 00:40:04,000
WHETHER I'M A FAMOUS MUSICIAN

1436
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,267
OR A MUSIC TEACHER.

1437
00:40:06,267 --> 00:40:07,400
I'M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT THE

1438
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:09,433
FUTURE IS GONNA HOLD FOR ME.

1439
00:40:09,433 --> 00:40:11,333
HEY.

1440
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:14,267
HEY, YOU GOT SOME BIG EYES, MAN.

1441
00:40:14,267 --> 00:40:15,700
BUT WHENEVER I GET DISCOURAGED

1442
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,600
OR DISAPPOINTED IN SOMETHING,

1443
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:19,033
I JUST LOOK AT EDEN AND KNOW

1444
00:40:19,033 --> 00:40:20,967
THAT AT THE END OF THE DAY, I

1445
00:40:20,967 --> 00:40:22,533
HAVE TO DO THE BEST THAT I CAN

1446
00:40:22,533 --> 00:40:23,533
TO PROVIDE FOR HIM

1447
00:40:23,533 --> 00:40:25,433
AND MAKE HIM HAPPY.

YOU WANT TO BE WITH ME.
