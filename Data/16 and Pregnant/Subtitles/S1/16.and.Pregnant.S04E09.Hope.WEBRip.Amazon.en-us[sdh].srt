1
00:00:03,796 --> 00:00:05,419
>> [laughs]

2
00:00:05,419 --> 00:00:07,145
HI, I'M HOPE.

3
00:00:07,145 --> 00:00:09,423
I'M 17 YEARS OLD, AND I'M FROM

4
00:00:09,423 --> 00:00:10,596
LEE'S SUMMIT, MISSOURI,

5
00:00:10,596 --> 00:00:12,564
JUST OUTSIDE OF KANSAS CITY.

6
00:00:12,564 --> 00:00:14,531
MY PARENTS ARE DIVORCED, AND I

7
00:00:14,531 --> 00:00:16,016
LIVE WITH MY MOM AND MY LITTLE

8
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:17,362
BROTHER AND SISTER.

9
00:00:17,362 --> 00:00:18,639
I PICKED UP THE WRONG CARD.

10
00:00:18,639 --> 00:00:20,606
>> YOU SHOULD PICK UP A TWO.

11
00:00:20,606 --> 00:00:22,401
>> I JUST GRADUATED FROM HIGH

12
00:00:22,401 --> 00:00:24,127
SCHOOL, AND I'M EXCITED TO GO TO

13
00:00:24,127 --> 00:00:25,025
COLLEGE.

14
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,578
WHEN I'M NOT WORKING PART-TIME

15
00:00:26,578 --> 00:00:28,097
IN A LOCAL COFFEE SHOP...

16
00:00:28,097 --> 00:00:29,029
OH, MAN.

17
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,858
I'M USUALLY OUT HAVING FUN

18
00:00:30,858 --> 00:00:32,756
WITH MY FRIENDS.

19
00:00:32,756 --> 00:00:34,379
I MET BEN A YEAR AGO,

20
00:00:34,379 --> 00:00:35,794
AND WE'VE STARTED HANGING OUT.

21
00:00:35,794 --> 00:00:36,450
UH-OH.

22
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:37,175
>> I THINK YOU'RE BUYING

23
00:00:37,175 --> 00:00:37,934
ICE CREAM.

24
00:00:37,934 --> 00:00:38,935
>> I THINK I'M BUYING ICE CREAM

25
00:00:38,935 --> 00:00:40,109
TOO.

26
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:41,938
I REALLY LIKED HIM A LOT,

27
00:00:41,938 --> 00:00:43,077
BUT BEN WAS A PARTY BOY

28
00:00:43,077 --> 00:00:44,320
AND WASN'T LOOKING FOR

29
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:45,976
A RELATIONSHIP, SO IT WAS NO

30
00:00:45,976 --> 00:00:47,633
SURPRISE THAT AFTER WE HOOKED UP

31
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:49,428
A FEW TIMES, HE TOTALLY

32
00:00:49,428 --> 00:00:50,602
BLEW ME OFF.

33
00:00:50,602 --> 00:00:51,775
MY FRIENDS WARNED ME THAT BEN

34
00:00:51,775 --> 00:00:53,329
WASN'T SERIOUS ABOUT ME.

35
00:00:53,329 --> 00:00:54,019
>> I WORRY.

36
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:55,986
I KNOW YOU NEED, LIKE, A LOT

37
00:00:55,986 --> 00:00:56,677
FROM HIM.

38
00:00:56,677 --> 00:00:58,403
>> I WAS TOTALLY READY TO GIVE

39
00:00:58,403 --> 00:01:00,025
UP ON HIM, BUT THEN I HAD TO

40
00:01:00,025 --> 00:01:01,337
CALL AND TELL HIM

41
00:01:01,337 --> 00:01:03,373
CALL AND TELL HIM
I'M PREGNANT.

42
00:01:03,373 --> 00:01:07,998
I'M PREGNANT.

43
00:01:07,998 --> 00:01:09,310
WHEN BEN FOUND OUT I WAS

44
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:10,725
PREGNANT, HE SAID HE DIDN'T

45
00:01:10,725 --> 00:01:12,279
WANT ANYTHING TO DO WITH ME

46
00:01:12,279 --> 00:01:13,728
OR THE BABY.

47
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:15,558
LUCKILY I HAD THE SUPPORT OF

48
00:01:15,558 --> 00:01:17,077
MY MOM, ALTHOUGH SHE'S HAD

49
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:18,423
A HARD TIME ACCEPTING

50
00:01:18,423 --> 00:01:19,217
THAT I GOT PREGNANT.

51
00:01:19,217 --> 00:01:20,183
>> YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT A SHOCK

52
00:01:20,183 --> 00:01:22,565
THAT WAS FOR YOU TO NEVER HAVE

53
00:01:22,565 --> 00:01:25,533
HAD A BOYFRIEND, AND THEN ALL OF

54
00:01:25,533 --> 00:01:27,777
A SUDDEN, FIRST PERSON YOU'VE

55
00:01:27,777 --> 00:01:30,607
HAD SEX WITH, YOU GET PREGNANT.

56
00:01:30,607 --> 00:01:32,161
HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

57
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:34,749
>> LIKE, I MET BEN A YEAR AGO,

58
00:01:34,749 --> 00:01:36,130
WHENEVER I WAS WORKING AT THAT

59
00:01:36,130 --> 00:01:38,650
RESTAURANT.

60
00:01:38,650 --> 00:01:39,892
EVERYBODY WOULD GO OUT AND PARTY

61
00:01:39,892 --> 00:01:42,136
TOGETHER, AND WE JUST STARTED

62
00:01:42,136 --> 00:01:43,275
HANGING OUT.

63
00:01:43,275 --> 00:01:47,037
THE IDEA OF SEX CAME UP, AND I

64
00:01:47,037 --> 00:01:48,832
FIGURED I WAS READY.

65
00:01:48,832 --> 00:01:50,800
>> DID HE KNOW THAT THAT WAS

66
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,252
YOUR FIRST TIME?

67
00:01:54,252 --> 00:01:55,356
>> HE DIDN'T HAVE A CONDOM.

68
00:01:55,356 --> 00:01:57,082
HE'S LIKE, "I'LL JUST PULL OUT."

69
00:01:57,082 --> 00:01:57,876
AND I WAS LIKE,

70
00:01:57,876 --> 00:01:59,291
"OKAY, THAT'LL WORK."

71
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:01,362
THEN WE HAD SEX A COUPLE TIMES,

72
00:02:01,362 --> 00:02:03,916
AND THEN I WAS PREGNANT.

73
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,090
ALL MY FRIENDS ARE LIKE,

74
00:02:05,090 --> 00:02:05,918
"WELL, YOU COULD GIVE IT UP

75
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:06,885
FOR ADOPTION."

76
00:02:06,885 --> 00:02:08,300
LIKE, I THINK THAT'D BE HARD TO,

77
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:11,407
LIKE, TO SEE IT, FEEL IT KICK,

78
00:02:11,407 --> 00:02:12,373
AND THEN JUST, LIKE, GIVE IT

79
00:02:12,373 --> 00:02:13,512
AWAY.

80
00:02:13,512 --> 00:02:17,516
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

81
00:02:17,516 --> 00:02:19,104
>> AND TALKING TO ME WAS NOT

82
00:02:19,104 --> 00:02:20,726
IN YOUR MIND-SET.

83
00:02:20,726 --> 00:02:22,107
>> NO, 'CAUSE I KNEW YOU'D BE

84
00:02:22,107 --> 00:02:23,695
DISAPPOINTED, SO I DIDN'T WANT

85
00:02:23,695 --> 00:02:25,973
TO TELL YOU.

86
00:02:25,973 --> 00:02:26,629
ALL MY FRIENDS WERE LIKE,

87
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:27,285
"COME ON.

88
00:02:27,285 --> 00:02:27,975
YOU CAN DO IT TONIGHT."

89
00:02:27,975 --> 00:02:28,769
AND I'D BE LIKE, "OKAY, I'M

90
00:02:28,769 --> 00:02:29,563
GONNA DO IT."

91
00:02:29,563 --> 00:02:31,151
I WANT THE LOVE AND SUPPORT AND,

92
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:32,152
LIKE, TO KNOW IT'S GONNA BE

93
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,947
OKAY, SO I WAS LIKE, "MAYBE I'LL

94
00:02:34,947 --> 00:02:37,364
JUST GO UP IN YOUR ROOM."

95
00:02:37,364 --> 00:02:39,469
JUST GO UP IN YOUR ROOM."
AND I DID.

96
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:41,954
AND I DID.

97
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:44,405
AND IT MADE THINGS BETTER,

98
00:02:44,405 --> 00:02:47,028
THOUGH.

99
00:02:47,028 --> 00:02:51,585
IT MADE IT SEEM NOT AS HARD,

100
00:02:51,585 --> 00:02:55,175
'CAUSE I FELT LIKE I WAS ALONE.

101
00:02:55,175 --> 00:02:56,831
IT MEANS A LOT TO ME THAT MY MOM

102
00:02:56,831 --> 00:02:58,626
IS BY MY SIDE, BUT WHO I REALLY

103
00:02:58,626 --> 00:03:00,973
WANT IS BEN.

104
00:03:00,973 --> 00:03:02,423
AFTER IGNORING ME FOR TWO

105
00:03:02,423 --> 00:03:03,907
MONTHS, HE FINALLY CALLED ME

106
00:03:03,907 --> 00:03:05,288
BACK AND SAID HE'S HAD A CHANGE

107
00:03:05,288 --> 00:03:06,116
OF HEART.

108
00:03:06,116 --> 00:03:07,325
HE WANTS TO BE A PART OF OUR

109
00:03:07,325 --> 00:03:09,119
BABY'S LIFE AND WANTS US TO

110
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:10,155
START DATING.

111
00:03:10,155 --> 00:03:11,639
HE'S EVEN FOUND A NEW APARTMENT

112
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:13,054
AND WANTS ME TO MOVE IN WITH HIM

113
00:03:13,054 --> 00:03:15,195
BEFORE THE BABY IS BORN.

114
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,506
EVEN THOUGH HE LIVES AN HOUR

115
00:03:16,506 --> 00:03:17,749
AWAY AND OUR RELATIONSHIP IS

116
00:03:17,749 --> 00:03:19,509
STILL NEW, I THINK LIVING

117
00:03:19,509 --> 00:03:20,959
TOGETHER IS WHAT'S BEST FOR

118
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,030
TOGETHER IS WHAT'S BEST FOR
OUR BABY.

119
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,136
OUR BABY.

120
00:03:26,136 --> 00:03:27,137
BUT I'M WORRIED ABOUT BEING

121
00:03:27,137 --> 00:03:28,208
SO FAR AWAY FROM MY MOM

122
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:30,037
AND MY FRIENDS.

123
00:03:30,037 --> 00:03:31,038
>> I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE

124
00:03:31,038 --> 00:03:31,694
YOU'RE PREGNANT.

125
00:03:31,694 --> 00:03:32,626
>> I KNOW.

126
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:33,282
>> SHE KNEW WHEN SHE WAS

127
00:03:33,282 --> 00:03:34,006
PREGNANT.

128
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:34,973
SHE KNEW AUTOMATICALLY, BECAUSE,

129
00:03:34,973 --> 00:03:36,457
LIKE, THE NEXT, LIKE--MAYBE TWO

130
00:03:36,457 --> 00:03:37,527
DAYS LATER, SHE WAS LIKE,

131
00:03:37,527 --> 00:03:38,908
"I THINK I'M PREGNANT."

132
00:03:38,908 --> 00:03:40,081
I WAS LIKE, "WHAT?"

133
00:03:40,081 --> 00:03:41,635
>> LIKE, I TEXTED BEN.

134
00:03:41,635 --> 00:03:43,223
I WAS LIKE, "IT'S FOR REAL.

135
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,465
LIKE, I'M NOT KIDDING.

136
00:03:44,465 --> 00:03:45,466
I'M NOT TRYING TO GET BACK

137
00:03:45,466 --> 00:03:46,226
WITH YOU."

138
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:50,057
I WAS LIKE, "JUST, LIKE,

139
00:03:50,057 --> 00:03:51,058
RESPOND TO ME.

140
00:03:51,058 --> 00:03:52,404
LIKE, STOP IGNORING ME."

141
00:03:52,404 --> 00:03:53,163
>> I GOT FED UP WITH IT,

142
00:03:53,163 --> 00:03:54,475
WITH YOU BEING UPSET SO MUCH,

143
00:03:54,475 --> 00:03:55,821
SO I STARTED TEXTING BEN,

144
00:03:55,821 --> 00:03:56,822
AND I, LIKE, TOLD HIM HE WAS

145
00:03:56,822 --> 00:03:57,996
A PIECE OF [bleep] AND STUFF,

146
00:03:57,996 --> 00:03:59,480
BECAUSE--AND HE WAS GONNA BE,

147
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,654
LIKE, THIS DEADBEAT DAD

148
00:04:00,654 --> 00:04:03,001
AND ALL THIS STUFF ABOUT HIM.

149
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:03,898
>> SO I'D TEXT HIM EVERY

150
00:04:03,898 --> 00:04:04,692
SINGLE DAY.

151
00:04:04,692 --> 00:04:06,073
I WAS JUST LIKE, "I JUST WANT

152
00:04:06,073 --> 00:04:06,901
YOU TO TELL ME, LIKE,

153
00:04:06,901 --> 00:04:08,524
EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE OKAY."

154
00:04:08,524 --> 00:04:10,733
>> DO YOU THINK BEN IS GONNA BE

155
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:11,492
A GOOD DAD?

156
00:04:11,492 --> 00:04:12,286
>> I THINK HE'S GONNA BE

157
00:04:12,286 --> 00:04:13,080
A GOOD DAD.

158
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,564
I JUST--HE'S NOT A GOOD

159
00:04:14,564 --> 00:04:15,496
BOYFRIEND.

160
00:04:15,496 --> 00:04:16,842
>> HAVE YOUR PARENTS, LIKE,

161
00:04:16,842 --> 00:04:17,912
EVER MET BEN YET?

162
00:04:17,912 --> 00:04:18,775
>> NOPE--

163
00:04:18,775 --> 00:04:19,500
>> NOT AT ALL?

164
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,399
>> NO, THEY HAVEN'T MET HIM.

165
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:23,090
I NEVER BROUGHT HIM AROUND,

166
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:24,919
JUST BECAUSE, LIKE, I DIDN'T

167
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:26,507
THINK IT WAS SERIOUS, YOU KNOW?

168
00:04:26,507 --> 00:04:29,234
I GUESS, LIKE, THEY SHOULD MEET

169
00:04:29,234 --> 00:04:32,444
SOMETIME SOON, BUT I'D RATHER

170
00:04:32,444 --> 00:04:33,790
WAIT AS LONG AS POSSIBLE, 'CAUSE

171
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,794
IT'S GONNA BE REALLY AWKWARD.

172
00:04:37,794 --> 00:04:40,418
LIKE, I'M JUST SCARED, LIKE,

173
00:04:40,418 --> 00:04:43,524
HE'S NOT GONNA BE THERE 100%.

174
00:04:43,524 --> 00:04:44,905
>> I'M KIND OF DOUBTING THAT

175
00:04:44,905 --> 00:04:46,389
HE'S GONNA BE THERE, LIKE,

176
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:48,253
THE WHOLE TIME.

177
00:04:48,253 --> 00:04:49,323
>> I'M GLAD MY FRIENDS HAVE MY

178
00:04:49,323 --> 00:04:51,256
BACK, 'CAUSE I'M REALLY WORRIED

179
00:04:51,256 --> 00:04:52,464
HOW THINGS WILL BE LIVING AT

180
00:04:52,464 --> 00:04:53,534
BEN'S.

181
00:04:53,534 --> 00:04:54,742
AND SINCE WE JUST STARTED TO

182
00:04:54,742 --> 00:04:56,330
WORK THINGS OUT, BEN'S ONLY

183
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:57,504
COMFORTABLE COMING AROUND WHEN

184
00:04:57,504 --> 00:04:58,988
NOBODY'S HOME.

185
00:04:58,988 --> 00:05:01,093
[doorbell rings]

186
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:01,784
>> HEY.

187
00:05:01,784 --> 00:05:02,543
>> HEY.

188
00:05:02,543 --> 00:05:03,406
>> WHAT'S UP?

189
00:05:03,406 --> 00:05:06,236
>> NOT MUCH.

190
00:05:06,236 --> 00:05:07,893
EVERYBODY'S IN ST. LOUIS,

191
00:05:07,893 --> 00:05:11,518
SO NOBODY'S HERE.

192
00:05:11,518 --> 00:05:12,933
SO I'M MOVING IN BEFORE THE

193
00:05:12,933 --> 00:05:14,624
BABY'S BORN OR AFTER?

194
00:05:14,624 --> 00:05:15,832
>> WELL, YOU'RE STAYING THERE

195
00:05:15,832 --> 00:05:16,764
AND EVERYTHING, BUT WE'RE NOT

196
00:05:16,764 --> 00:05:18,318
MOVING ANYTHING BUT THE BABY'S

197
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:19,767
STUFF INTO MY NEW APARTMENT,

198
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:20,527
'CAUSE THERE'S NO ROOM.

199
00:05:20,527 --> 00:05:21,251
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

200
00:05:21,251 --> 00:05:22,391
YOU CAN STAY THERE EVERY NIGHT

201
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:23,668
IF YOU WANT TO AND LIVE THERE

202
00:05:23,668 --> 00:05:24,979
OR SAY WHATEVER YOU WANT TO SAY,

203
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:27,085
BUT WE CAN'T MOVE ALL THE BIG

204
00:05:27,085 --> 00:05:28,258
STUFF, IS WHAT I'M SAYING,

205
00:05:28,258 --> 00:05:30,191
UNTIL AFTER THE BABY IS BORN.

206
00:05:30,191 --> 00:05:31,054
>> LIKE, I UNDERSTAND, LIKE,

207
00:05:31,054 --> 00:05:31,986
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF ROOM,

208
00:05:31,986 --> 00:05:33,022
WHICH I'M FINE WITH.

209
00:05:33,022 --> 00:05:34,230
>> WELL, YOU'RE STILL GONNA BE

210
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:36,163
STAYING THERE.

211
00:05:36,163 --> 00:05:37,198
>> ARE YOU SCARED TO MEET MY

212
00:05:37,198 --> 00:05:37,854
PARENTS?

213
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:38,924
>> OF COURSE.

214
00:05:38,924 --> 00:05:40,340
I JUST DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE

215
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,031
GONNA HATE ME, 'CAUSE--

216
00:05:42,031 --> 00:05:43,204
I DON'T KNOW--I WAS GONE FOR

217
00:05:43,204 --> 00:05:44,344
THE FIRST MONTH OR SO

218
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,242
AND EVERYTHING, YOU KNOW?

219
00:05:46,242 --> 00:05:48,002
WE ONLY HAD SEX, LIKE, THREE

220
00:05:48,002 --> 00:05:49,245
OR FOUR TIMES BEFORE YOU GOT

221
00:05:49,245 --> 00:05:51,316
PREGNANT, MAYBE FIVE,

222
00:05:51,316 --> 00:05:53,456
BUT I IGNORED YOU AFTER THAT.

223
00:05:53,456 --> 00:05:54,561
>> WHY?

224
00:05:54,561 --> 00:05:56,045
I DID NOTHING WRONG.

225
00:05:56,045 --> 00:05:57,287
>> I PARTIALLY FREAKED OUT

226
00:05:57,287 --> 00:05:58,392
'CAUSE YOU WERE A VIRGIN,

227
00:05:58,392 --> 00:06:00,256
AND I DIDN'T--I KNEW THAT YOU

228
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:01,568
WERE GONNA WANT A LONG-TERM

229
00:06:01,568 --> 00:06:02,810
RELATIONSHIP, AND THAT WASN'T

230
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,640
WHAT I WAS LOOKING FOR AT THAT

231
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,986
TIME, YOU KNOW?

232
00:06:05,986 --> 00:06:07,884
>> SO WHAT FINALLY MADE YOU--

233
00:06:07,884 --> 00:06:08,575
>> CHANGE MY MIND?

234
00:06:08,575 --> 00:06:11,474
>> YEAH, WHY'D YOU TEXT ME BACK

235
00:06:11,474 --> 00:06:12,510
THAT ONE TIME?

236
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:14,684
>> THAT'S MY KID, AND I'M GONNA

237
00:06:14,684 --> 00:06:16,686
HAVE TO OWN UP TO WHAT I DID.

238
00:06:16,686 --> 00:06:18,654
I'VE SPENT A LOT OF TIME

239
00:06:18,654 --> 00:06:20,587
IN MY LIFE RUNNING AWAY FROM

240
00:06:20,587 --> 00:06:21,760
THINGS I SHOULD BE TAKING

241
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,074
RESPONSIBILITY FOR.

242
00:06:25,074 --> 00:06:26,386
I'M TRYING NOT TO DO THAT FOR

243
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,422
I'M TRYING NOT TO DO THAT FOR
ONCE.

244
00:06:28,422 --> 00:06:34,635
ONCE.

245
00:06:34,635 --> 00:06:36,119
>> I'M SIX MONTHS PREGNANT,

246
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:37,845
AND I HAVE A BUSY SUMMER AHEAD.

247
00:06:37,845 --> 00:06:39,399
I'M WORKING FOUR SHIFTS A WEEK

248
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,986
TO SAVE MONEY FOR THE BABY.

249
00:06:40,986 --> 00:06:42,712
THE REST OF THE TIME, I'M TRYING

250
00:06:42,712 --> 00:06:43,886
TO HANG OUT WITH MY FRIENDS

251
00:06:43,886 --> 00:06:45,922
TO HANG OUT WITH MY FRIENDS
BEFORE THEY GO TO COLLEGE.

252
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:47,648
BEFORE THEY GO TO COLLEGE.

253
00:06:47,648 --> 00:06:48,649
>> WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE BEEN

254
00:06:48,649 --> 00:06:49,892
DOING FOR COLLEGE IF YOU

255
00:06:49,892 --> 00:06:51,687
WOULDN'T BE HAVING THE BABY?

256
00:06:51,687 --> 00:06:53,585
>> HONESTLY, I WANTED TO GO TO

257
00:06:53,585 --> 00:06:56,588
ARIZONA STATE UNIVERSITY, BUT IT

258
00:06:56,588 --> 00:06:58,659
WASN'T FOR A VERY GOOD REASON.

259
00:06:58,659 --> 00:07:00,040
>> WHAT WAS THE REASON?

260
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,593
>> IT'S THE NUMBER ONE PARTY

261
00:07:01,593 --> 00:07:02,870
COLLEGE IN AMERICA.

262
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:04,389
>> OH, MY GOD.

263
00:07:04,389 --> 00:07:06,115
SO HOW DO YOU FEEL, THE THOUGHT

264
00:07:06,115 --> 00:07:07,254
OF YOUR PARTY DAYS BEING

265
00:07:07,254 --> 00:07:08,324
OVER NOW?

266
00:07:08,324 --> 00:07:09,290
>> ALL MY FRIENDS, LIKE,

267
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:10,809
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT,

268
00:07:10,809 --> 00:07:12,777
ALWAYS GO OUT AND PARTY.

269
00:07:12,777 --> 00:07:14,295
>> I DON'T.

270
00:07:14,295 --> 00:07:15,331
YOU CAN COME HANG WITH ME.

271
00:07:15,331 --> 00:07:16,574
>> YEAH, NOBODY HANGS OUT WITH

272
00:07:16,574 --> 00:07:18,334
ME ANYMORE 'CAUSE--I DON'T KNOW.

273
00:07:18,334 --> 00:07:19,162
I JUST FEEL LIKE THEY'D RATHER

274
00:07:19,162 --> 00:07:20,370
GO PARTY.

275
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:21,820
'CAUSE I KNOW, LIKE, IF I WASN'T

276
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:22,890
PREGNANT, LIKE, I'D BE DOING THE

277
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:23,753
SAME THING.

278
00:07:23,753 --> 00:07:25,824
>> YEAH.

279
00:07:25,824 --> 00:07:26,756
SO HOW ARE THINGS GOING

280
00:07:26,756 --> 00:07:28,551
WITH BEN?

281
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:29,863
>> PRETTY GOOD.

282
00:07:29,863 --> 00:07:32,072
MONDAY NIGHT, THOUGH, LIKE,

283
00:07:32,072 --> 00:07:33,142
WE WERE SITTING THERE, LIKE,

284
00:07:33,142 --> 00:07:34,592
YOU KNOW, JUST, LIKE, TALKING,

285
00:07:34,592 --> 00:07:35,938
AND HE WAS LIKE, "YEAH,

286
00:07:35,938 --> 00:07:37,940
AT FIRST, I STARTED TALKING TO

287
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,460
YOU ONLY BECAUSE OF THE BABY."

288
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,807
AND I WAS LIKE, "OKAY, WELL"--

289
00:07:42,807 --> 00:07:43,601
>> WHAT ABOUT NOW?

290
00:07:43,601 --> 00:07:45,085
>> YEAH, SO, LIKE, NOW I FEEL

291
00:07:45,085 --> 00:07:47,190
LIKE, "I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE

292
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,158
STILL TALKING TO ME ONLY BECAUSE

293
00:07:49,158 --> 00:07:50,849
OF THE BABY, OR IF IT HAS

294
00:07:50,849 --> 00:07:51,954
ACTUALLY CHANGED."

295
00:07:51,954 --> 00:07:52,886
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE IT'S JUST

296
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:53,990
THE WAY MY MIND THINKS.

297
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,198
>> MINE WOULD TOO.

298
00:07:55,198 --> 00:07:57,304
HAVE YOU ASKED HIM THAT YET?

299
00:07:57,304 --> 00:07:59,202
>> NO, I DON'T WANT TO, LIKE,

300
00:07:59,202 --> 00:08:01,584
START A FIGHT OVER NOTHING.

301
00:08:01,584 --> 00:08:03,793
>> I MEAN, IT'S NOT REALLY--

302
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:04,553
ALL YOU'RE DOING IS ASKING

303
00:08:04,553 --> 00:08:05,485
A QUESTION.

304
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:06,555
IT'S NOT REALLY OVER NOTHING.

305
00:08:06,555 --> 00:08:07,521
LIKE, YOU WANT TO KNOW

306
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:09,592
LIKE, YOU WANT TO KNOW
HOW HE FEELS ABOUT YOU.

307
00:08:09,592 --> 00:08:22,743
HOW HE FEELS ABOUT YOU.

308
00:08:22,743 --> 00:08:24,849
HOW HE FEELS ABOUT YOU.
>> HEY, BREAKFAST IS READY.

309
00:08:24,849 --> 00:08:27,334
>> HEY, BREAKFAST IS READY.

310
00:08:27,334 --> 00:08:28,887
>> I TOLD MY MOM I'M PLANNING ON

311
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:30,648
MOVING IN WITH BEN, AND SHE WAS

312
00:08:30,648 --> 00:08:32,373
SURPRISED, BECAUSE SHE HASN'T

313
00:08:32,373 --> 00:08:33,547
EVEN MET HIM YET.

314
00:08:33,547 --> 00:08:36,516
>> WHEN CAN WE MEET BEN?

315
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,793
'CAUSE I'VE GOT A MILLION

316
00:08:37,793 --> 00:08:39,173
QUESTIONS FOR HIM.

317
00:08:39,173 --> 00:08:40,243
>> LIKE WHAT?

318
00:08:40,243 --> 00:08:42,418
>> I'M JUST REALLY WORRIED THAT

319
00:08:42,418 --> 00:08:44,454
HE'S GONNA TAKE OFF AGAIN, AND

320
00:08:44,454 --> 00:08:45,352
YOU'RE GONNA GET HURT.

321
00:08:45,352 --> 00:08:47,699
I DON'T KNOW--MOM STUFF.

322
00:08:47,699 --> 00:08:50,046
>> IT'LL BE SO AWKWARD.

323
00:08:50,046 --> 00:08:51,116
>> NOW, YOU KNOW I'M HERE FOR

324
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:53,429
YOU, BUT THINGS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN

325
00:08:53,429 --> 00:08:56,536
SO TIGHT FOR ME FINANCIALLY

326
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,883
THAT I WON'T BE ABLE TO HELP.

327
00:08:58,883 --> 00:09:00,850
ARE YOU EXPECTING ME TO HELP?

328
00:09:00,850 --> 00:09:02,576
>> I THINK WE'LL BE FINE.

329
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:03,819
>> IF YOU'RE MOVING IN TOGETHER,

330
00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:05,821
THEN YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE STRONG

331
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:07,132
FEELINGS FOR HIM.

332
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:07,995
HOW DO YOU FEEL?

333
00:09:07,995 --> 00:09:11,171
ARE YOU AFRAID OF GETTING HURT?

334
00:09:11,171 --> 00:09:12,482
>> I MEAN, THERE'S ALWAYS

335
00:09:12,482 --> 00:09:13,932
A LITTLE FEAR JUST BECAUSE I WAS

336
00:09:13,932 --> 00:09:15,831
ABANDONED AT FIRST, YOU KNOW?

337
00:09:15,831 --> 00:09:17,626
>> I'M KIND OF CONCERNED THAT

338
00:09:17,626 --> 00:09:20,490
HE'LL TAKE OFF AGAIN AFTER THE

339
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:23,079
BABY'S BORN.

340
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:24,494
>> I UNDERSTAND WHY MY MOM HAS

341
00:09:24,494 --> 00:09:26,842
DOUBTS ABOUT BEN, BECAUSE I FEEL

342
00:09:26,842 --> 00:09:28,947
DOUBTS ABOUT BEN, BECAUSE I FEEL
THE SAME WAY.

343
00:09:28,947 --> 00:09:30,777
THE SAME WAY.

344
00:09:30,777 --> 00:09:32,295
SINCE MY MOM CAN'T HELP PAY

345
00:09:32,295 --> 00:09:33,642
FOR THE BABY, I'M TRYING TO

346
00:09:33,642 --> 00:09:35,264
KEEP MY JOB UNTIL MY DUE DATE.

347
00:09:35,264 --> 00:09:36,506
WE HAVE AN AMERICANO WITH

348
00:09:36,506 --> 00:09:37,611
VANILLA.

349
00:09:37,611 --> 00:09:38,785
BUT WORK HAS BEEN REALLY HARD

350
00:09:38,785 --> 00:09:40,649
RECENTLY BECAUSE MY FEET GET

351
00:09:40,649 --> 00:09:42,720
RECENTLY BECAUSE MY FEET GET
SWOLLEN FROM STANDING ALL DAY.

352
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:47,828
SWOLLEN FROM STANDING ALL DAY.

353
00:09:47,828 --> 00:09:49,589
I'M GOING FOR A CHECKUP

354
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,107
AFTER WORK AND HOPE MY DOCTOR

355
00:09:51,107 --> 00:09:54,490
CAN HELP ME WITH THE SWELLING.

356
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:56,388
SINCE BEN HASN'T MET MY MOM YET,

357
00:09:56,388 --> 00:09:57,527
HE DOESN'T COME TO MY

358
00:09:57,527 --> 00:09:58,321
APPOINTMENTS.

359
00:09:58,321 --> 00:09:59,771
MY TOES ARE SWOLLEN.

360
00:09:59,771 --> 00:10:01,014
IT'S SO SAD TO SEE LITTLE FAT

361
00:10:01,014 --> 00:10:03,016
TOES.

362
00:10:03,016 --> 00:10:03,637
>> HOW ARE YOU DOING?

363
00:10:03,637 --> 00:10:04,431
>> GOOD.

364
00:10:04,431 --> 00:10:05,259
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU.

365
00:10:05,259 --> 00:10:06,364
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU.

366
00:10:06,364 --> 00:10:07,020
>> HELLO, THERE.

367
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,954
>> HELLO, THERE.
>> HI, I'M HOPE'S MOM.

368
00:10:09,954 --> 00:10:12,715
>> HI, I'M HOPE'S MOM.

369
00:10:12,715 --> 00:10:14,165
>> YEAH, I DO GOT A QUESTION,

370
00:10:14,165 --> 00:10:15,269

00:11:24,856 --> 00:11:27,617

I WAS HOPING I COULD GET MORE

405
00:11:32,588 --> 00:11:34,314
BREAKS BUT WAS TOLD IT WAS

406
00:11:34,314 --> 00:11:35,971
AGAINST COMPANY POLICY.

407
00:11:35,971 --> 00:11:37,697
SO EVEN THOUGH I NEED THE MONEY,

408
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,491
I HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO QUIT.

409
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:40,907
BEN WORKS FULL-TIME AS

411
00:11:42,632 --> 00:11:44,704

416
00:11:54,783 --> 00:11:56,301
TO NAME HIM TRISTAN.

417
00:11:56,301 --> 00:11:57,578
>> DO YOU SEE THOSE LINES RIGHT

418
00:11:57,578 --> 00:11:58,718
NEXT TO HIS FACE?

419
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,547
THAT'S THE UMBILICAL CORD.

420
00:12:00,547 --> 00:12:01,790
>> I CAN TELL HE'S REALLY

421
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:03,826
EXCITED ABOUT THE BABY.

422
00:12:03,826 --> 00:12:05,586
I JUST NEED TO KNOW HOW HE FEELS

423
00:12:05,586 --> 00:12:09,142
ABOUT ME.

424
00:12:09,142 --> 00:12:10,833
SO I QUIT MY JOB.

425
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,352
>> YEAH, I DON'T THINK YOU

426
00:12:12,352 --> 00:12:13,353
SHOULD BE WORKING THAT LONG

427
00:12:13,353 --> 00:12:14,906
WITHOUT A BREAK.

428
00:12:14,906 --> 00:12:15,596
I DON'T KNOW.

429
00:12:15,596 --> 00:12:18,013
I'M NOT DEPENDING ON YOU FOR MY

430
00:12:18,013 --> 00:12:20,774
RENT OR THE LIGHT BILL OR THE

431
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:22,431
FOOD OR ANYTHING.

432
00:12:22,431 --> 00:12:23,639
>> DO YOU THINK WE'RE IN A GOOD

433
00:12:23,639 --> 00:12:25,779
PLACE IN OUR RELATIONSHIP?

434
00:12:25,779 --> 00:12:27,091
>> ARE YOU NOT HAPPY WITH WHERE

435
00:12:27,091 --> 00:12:28,126
IT'S AT, OR...

436
00:12:28,126 --> 00:12:29,541

WE'VE, LIKE, GOTTEN BETTER SINCE

00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:35,547
THE BEGINNING?

440
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:36,238
>> THERE WASN'T REALLY A

441
00:12:36,238 --> 00:12:37,515
RELATIONSHIP IN THE BEGINNING,

442
00:12:37,515 --> 00:12:39,689
AND THEN AFTER YOU GOT PREGNANT,

443
00:12:39,689 --> 00:12:40,863
YEAH.

444
00:12:40,863 --> 00:12:41,968
WE STARTED WORKING ON OUR

445
00:12:41,968 --> 00:12:42,658
RELATIONSHIP.

446
00:12:42,658 --> 00:12:44,315
IT'S GOTTEN 100 TIMES BETTER.

447
00:12:44,315 --> 00:12:45,005
>> I DON'T KNOW.

448
00:12:45,005 --> 00:12:46,696
I ALWAYS WANTED TO BE WITH YOU.

449
00:12:46,696 --> 00:12:48,043
YOU ALREADY KNOW THIS.

450
00:12:48,043 --> 00:12:49,527
>> YEAH.

451
00:12:49,527 --> 00:12:50,735
>> ARE YOU HAPPY THAT YOU'RE

452
00:12:50,735 --> 00:12:52,357
ACTUALLY TIED DOWN NOW?

453
00:12:52,357 --> 00:12:53,773
I KNOW BEFORE, YOU NEVER WANTED

454
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,222
TO BE.

455
00:12:55,222 --> 00:12:58,260
>> YEAH, I'M GLAD, 'CAUSE--

456
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:58,916
I DON'T KNOW.

457
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:02,091
I ALWAYS WANTED TO FIND SOMEONE

458
00:13:02,091 --> 00:13:04,369
TO BE WITH, BUT--I DON'T KNOW.

459
00:13:04,369 --> 00:13:06,682
IT WAS JUST THE WHOLE PARTY,

460
00:13:06,682 --> 00:13:08,477
"LOOKING COOL IN FRONT OF MY

461
00:13:08,477 --> 00:13:09,961
FRIENDS" THING.

462
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:11,135
>> BUT YOU ACTUALLY WANT TO BE

463
00:13:11,135 --> 00:13:12,205

464
00:13:12,205 --> 00:13:14,345
>> OH, YEAH.

465
00:13:14,345 --> 00:13:15,587

466
00:13:15,587 --> 00:13:16,416
BABY THEN?

467
00:13:16,416 --> 00:13:17,313
>> NO, IT'S NOT.

468
00:13:17,313 --> 00:13:18,142
>> PROMISE?

469
00:13:18,142 --> 00:13:19,039
>> IF IT WAS JUST 'CAUSE THE

470
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:19,799
BABY, I WOULDN'T LET YOU

471
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,801
MOVE IN.

472
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,699
I WOULDN'T, LIKE--WE'D BE

473
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:26,046

00:13:26,046 --> 00:13:27,772
DIFFERENT WAY, YOU KNOW?

475
00:13:27,772 --> 00:13:29,325
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT A DAY

476
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:31,327
THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE MOVING IN?

477
00:13:31,327 --> 00:13:32,190
>> I DON'T KNOW.

478
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:34,710
WE SHOULD DO AUGUST 1ST.

479
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:36,850
>> AUGUST 1ST IS ONLY A COUPLE

480
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:39,370
WEEKS AWAY.

481
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,509
>> I'VE BEEN HAVING LOTS OF

482
00:13:40,509 --> 00:13:42,131
DOUBTS, BUT I'M STARTING TO

483
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:43,305
BELIEVE THAT BEN REALLY WANTS TO

YOU'RE EITHER GONNA--THAT YOU'RE

501
00:14:19,997 --> 00:14:21,170
GONNA BREAK HER HEART.

502
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,620
>> I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT'S GONNA

503
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,001
HAPPEN IN THE FUTURE ABOUT US

504
00:14:24,001 --> 00:14:26,589
BEING TOGETHER, BUT, I MEAN,

MY KID, SO...

508
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:33,458
>> YOUR PLANS ARE TO MOVE IN

509
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,529
TOGETHER?

510
00:14:35,529 --> 00:14:36,323
WHEN?

511
00:14:36,323 --> 00:14:38,222
AFTER THE BABY OR BEFORE THE

512
00:14:38,222 --> 00:14:39,016
BABY?

513
00:14:39,016 --> 00:14:41,639
>> A MONTH BEFORE THE BABY.

514
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:43,054
>> IF SHE'S NOT WORKING, THEN

515
00:14:43,054 --> 00:14:44,504
WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO HELP OUT

516
00:14:44,504 --> 00:14:46,023
WITH CAR INSURANCE AND STUFF

517
00:14:46,023 --> 00:14:47,196
LIKE THAT, TO PAY FOR HER?

518
00:14:47,196 --> 00:14:48,508
>> YEAH, SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO PAY

519
00:14:48,508 --> 00:14:50,027
FOR THE FOOD OR RENT AND STUFF

520
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:50,786
THERE.

521
00:14:50,786 --> 00:14:53,099
I'LL BE TAKING CARE OF IT.

522
00:14:53,099 --> 00:14:54,272
THE MOVING IN--

523
00:14:54,272 --> 00:14:55,618
I THINK IT'S A GOOD DECISION,

524
00:14:55,618 --> 00:14:56,619
BUT SHE CAN STAY HERE--

525
00:14:56,619 --> 00:14:57,448
>> YOU THINK IT'S A GOOD

526
00:14:57,448 --> 00:14:58,276
DECISION?

527
00:14:58,276 --> 00:14:59,450
>> I WANT TO BE THERE TO GET UP

528
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,313
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

529
00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:01,486
AND HELP AND STUFF,

530
00:15:01,486 --> 00:15:03,316
SO--I DON'T KNOW.

531
00:15:03,316 --> 00:15:04,593
>> WELL, IT WARMS MY HEART

532
00:15:04,593 --> 00:15:05,663
A LITTLE BIT TO HEAR YOU SAY

533
00:15:05,663 --> 00:15:07,803
THAT--THAT YOU WANT TO BE THERE

534
00:15:07,803 --> 00:15:09,909
THAT--THAT YOU WANT TO BE THERE
AT NIGHT AND HELP HER TOO.

535
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:12,946
AT NIGHT AND HELP HER TOO.

00:15:12,946 --> 00:15:15,052
AT NIGHT AND HELP HER TOO.
LET'S GO ON IN.

537
00:15:15,052 --> 00:15:18,193
LET'S GO ON IN.

538
00:15:18,193 --> 00:15:18,987
HOW MUCH DID YOU WEIGH WHEN

539
00:15:18,987 --> 00:15:19,746
YOU WERE BORN?

540
00:15:19,746 --> 00:15:21,058
>> I WAS 8 POUNDS, 1 OUNCE.

541
00:15:21,058 --> 00:15:21,748
>> THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS.

542
00:15:21,748 --> 00:15:23,819
>> THAT'S WHAT SHE WAS.
>> THAT'S FUNNY.

543
00:15:23,819 --> 00:15:28,237
>> THAT'S FUNNY.

544
00:15:28,237 --> 00:15:29,929
>> THE WEEKS ARE FLYING BY,

545
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,585
AND IT'S TIME TO START PACKING.

546
00:15:31,585 --> 00:15:32,690
BEN DOESN'T WANT ME TO BRING

547
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,347
TOO MUCH STUFF BECAUSE HIS PLACE

548
00:15:34,347 --> 00:15:36,176
IS SMALL, AND WE STILL HAVE TO

549
00:15:36,176 --> 00:15:37,660
GET READY FOR THE BABY.

550
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:38,316
SO I'M TRYING TO PACK

551
00:15:38,316 --> 00:15:40,387
SO I'M TRYING TO PACK
ONLY THE ESSENTIALS.

552
00:15:40,387 --> 00:15:43,563
ONLY THE ESSENTIALS.

553
00:15:43,563 --> 00:15:44,909
>> NO.

554
00:15:44,909 --> 00:15:46,946
>> NO.
[laughs]

555
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,603
[laughs]

556
00:15:49,603 --> 00:15:50,950
WHILE I'M GETTING READY TO MOVE

557
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,710
IN WITH BEN AND BECOME A MOM,

558
00:15:52,710 --> 00:15:54,056
ALL MY FRIENDS ARE GETTING READY

559
00:15:54,056 --> 00:15:55,402
TO MOVE ON TO COLLEGE.

560
00:15:55,402 --> 00:15:56,783
>> CAN WE GET TWO PEDICURES?

561
00:15:56,783 --> 00:15:57,542
>> OH, WAIT, WHAT ABOUT THAT

562
00:15:57,542 --> 00:15:58,302
ONE?

563
00:15:58,302 --> 00:15:59,786
LET'S DO IT.

564
00:15:59,786 --> 00:16:01,339
>> HAVE A SEAT HERE.

565
00:16:01,339 --> 00:16:02,858
>> IS IT FUN GOING, LIKE,

566
00:16:02,858 --> 00:16:04,894
DORM SHOPPING?

567
00:16:04,894 --> 00:16:05,654
>> IT'S REALLY FUN.

568
00:16:05,654 --> 00:16:06,931
>> LIKE, EVERY STORE YOU GO TO,

569
00:16:06,931 --> 00:16:09,969
IT'S DORM, LIKE, SALES.

570
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,418
>> YEAH, "BACK TO SCHOOL."

571
00:16:11,418 --> 00:16:12,350
>> AND I'M LIKE, "REALLY?

572
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,006
REALLY?"

573
00:16:13,006 --> 00:16:14,076
I FEEL LIKE IT'S GETTING RUBBED

574
00:16:14,076 --> 00:16:14,766
IN MY FACE.

575
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:16,044
>> OH.

576
00:16:16,044 --> 00:16:16,734
>> IT WOULD'VE BEEN FUN,

577
00:16:16,734 --> 00:16:18,080
US GOING TO COLLEGE TOGETHER.

578
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,012
>> I WISH YOU COULD COME

579
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:19,944
WITH ME.

580
00:16:19,944 --> 00:16:23,361
>> I'M JEALOUS THAT, LIKE, YOU

581
00:16:23,361 --> 00:16:24,707
ACTUALLY GET TO, LIKE, GO LIVE

582
00:16:24,707 --> 00:16:26,433
AT THE COLLEGE, LIKE, HAVE THE

583
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:27,814
COLLEGE LIFE, YOU KNOW?

584
00:16:27,814 --> 00:16:29,333
LIKE, IF I GO, I'M JUST GONNA

585
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,403
BE, LIKE, A MOM GOING TO

586
00:16:30,403 --> 00:16:31,266
COLLEGE.

587
00:16:31,266 --> 00:16:32,543
BUT, LIKE, THE THING I'M MOST

588
00:16:32,543 --> 00:16:35,373
WORRIED ABOUT NOW IS, LIKE,

589
00:16:35,373 --> 00:16:36,202
I COULD GO TO SCHOOL,

590
00:16:36,202 --> 00:16:37,651
OR I COULD GET A JOB.

591
00:16:37,651 --> 00:16:38,825
WHAT DO YOU PICK?

592
00:16:38,825 --> 00:16:39,757
>> I WOULD RATHER HAVE THAT

593
00:16:39,757 --> 00:16:40,482
SAFETY BLANKET.

594
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:41,138
>> YEAH.

595
00:16:41,138 --> 00:16:42,760
>> 'CAUSE JOB--GETTING DECENT

596
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,349
JOBS WITHOUT COLLEGE DEGREES IS

597
00:16:45,349 --> 00:16:47,109
JUST--I DON'T KNOW.

598
00:16:47,109 --> 00:16:48,007
I GUESS THESE DAYS,

599
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,525
THEY'RE HARDER TO COME BY.

600
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:50,492
>> LIKE, I UNDERSTAND THAT,

601
00:16:50,492 --> 00:16:52,149
BUT THEN, LIKE, IT MAKES IT

602
00:16:52,149 --> 00:16:54,185
TEN TIMES HARDER ON US NOW.

603
00:16:54,185 --> 00:16:56,394
THEN BEN HAS TO, LIKE, LITERALLY

604
00:16:56,394 --> 00:16:57,568
PAY FOR EVERYTHING.

605
00:16:57,568 --> 00:16:59,397
I MEAN, IT SUCKS NOW, NOT HAVING

606
00:16:59,397 --> 00:17:00,364
A JOB.

607
00:17:00,364 --> 00:17:01,089
LIKE, I JUST DON'T WANT TO

608
00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:04,023
RELY ON PEOPLE.

609
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:05,783
I KNOW THAT SCHOOL IS IMPORTANT,

610
00:17:05,783 --> 00:17:07,302
BUT WITH NO MONEY AND A BABY ON

611
00:17:07,302 --> 00:17:08,924
THE WAY, I DON'T HAVE TOO MANY

612
00:17:08,924 --> 00:17:12,824
OPTIONS RIGHT NOW.

613
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:14,516
WHEN I GOT HOME, MY MOM

614
00:17:14,516 --> 00:17:16,035
WANTED TO TALK ABOUT MY PLAN

615
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:17,553
TO MOVE AN HOUR AWAY.

616
00:17:17,553 --> 00:17:19,417
>> I'M SAD THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE

617
00:17:19,417 --> 00:17:21,385
MOVING OUT, JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE

618
00:17:21,385 --> 00:17:22,144
MY BABY.

619
00:17:22,144 --> 00:17:23,387
>> IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE NEVER

620
00:17:23,387 --> 00:17:24,871
GONNA TALK TO EACH OTHER AGAIN.

621
00:17:24,871 --> 00:17:26,045
>> I KNOW.

622
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,598
THE ONLY CONCERN I HAVE IS,

623
00:17:27,598 --> 00:17:29,082
YOU'RE GONNA BE UP THERE WITH

624
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:30,842
A BRAND-NEW BABY.

625
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:33,259
WHEN I MET BEN, HE SAID ALL THE

626
00:17:33,259 --> 00:17:35,744
RIGHT THINGS, BUT IS HE SAYING

627
00:17:35,744 --> 00:17:37,573
ALL THE RIGHT THINGS BECAUSE

628
00:17:37,573 --> 00:17:40,024
HE'S MEETING YOUR MOTHER?

629
00:17:40,024 --> 00:17:41,336
I HOPE HE LOVES YOU.

630
00:17:41,336 --> 00:17:43,338
THAT'S MY ONLY WORRY AND FEAR,

631
00:17:43,338 --> 00:17:44,339
IS THAT YOU'RE GONNA GET

632
00:17:44,339 --> 00:17:45,340
YOUR HEART BROKEN,

633
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,031
AND I WANT YOUR GUARD TO BE UP

634
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:49,413
AND EXPECT NOTHING.

635
00:17:49,413 --> 00:17:50,414
>> I ALWAYS EXPECT THE WORST.

636
00:17:50,414 --> 00:17:53,037
>> I WANT YOU TO EXPECT NOTHING

637
00:17:53,037 --> 00:17:57,628
FROM THIS MAN, BECAUSE MEN SUCK.

638
00:17:57,628 --> 00:17:59,078
>> I THINK HE LOVES ME.

639
00:17:59,078 --> 00:18:00,769
>> IF SOMETHING BAD HAPPENS

640
00:18:00,769 --> 00:18:01,597
TO YOU--

641
00:18:01,597 --> 00:18:02,874
>> ARE YOU GONNA CRY?

642
00:18:02,874 --> 00:18:03,979
>> I AM GONNA BE HERE, PICKING

643
00:18:03,979 --> 00:18:05,256
UP THE PIECES AND HELPING YOU

644
00:18:05,256 --> 00:18:07,016
DEAL WITH IT, AND I HOPE THAT

645
00:18:07,016 --> 00:18:08,673
THINGS WORK OUT.

646
00:18:08,673 --> 00:18:09,916
I REALLY DO.

647
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,056
I DON'T WANT TO SABOTAGE

648
00:18:12,056 --> 00:18:13,057
YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM

649
00:18:13,057 --> 00:18:13,747
OR ANYTHING.

650
00:18:13,747 --> 00:18:15,128
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

651
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:17,372
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

652
00:18:17,372 --> 00:18:18,062
>> GIVE ME A HUG.

653
00:18:18,062 --> 00:18:21,962
DON'T CRY.

654
00:18:21,962 --> 00:18:23,999
DON'T CRY.
>> OH, MY BABY.

655
00:18:23,999 --> 00:18:38,634
>> OH, MY BABY.

656
00:18:38,634 --> 00:18:40,153
>> TRISTAN IS DUE IN A MONTH,

657
00:18:40,153 --> 00:18:42,224
>> TRISTAN IS DUE IN A MONTH,
AND I'M MOVING INTO BEN'S TODAY.

658
00:18:42,224 --> 00:18:45,124
AND I'M MOVING INTO BEN'S TODAY.

659
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,125
THINGS HAVE BEEN GOING WELL

660
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,230
BETWEEN US, AND I'M EXCITED.

661
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,714
>> YEAH, WE DEFINITELY HAVE TO

662
00:18:49,714 --> 00:18:50,888
PUT THE BED THERE TO COVER UP

663
00:18:50,888 --> 00:18:52,545
ALL THOSE SPOTS.

664
00:18:52,545 --> 00:18:54,063
>> BUT MY MOM DOESN'T SEEM

665
00:18:54,063 --> 00:18:57,550
TOO IMPRESSED.

666
00:18:57,550 --> 00:18:58,620
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK

667
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,862
OF THE PLACE?

668
00:18:59,862 --> 00:19:01,312
>> IT'S YUCKY.

669
00:19:01,312 --> 00:19:03,142
THAT WHOLE ENTRYWAY,

670
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,937
I SAW BUGS--DEAD BUGS.

671
00:19:05,937 --> 00:19:07,249
IF I WAS IN YOUR SITUATION AND

672
00:19:07,249 --> 00:19:08,457
I HAD TO LIVE HERE, I THINK

673
00:19:08,457 --> 00:19:09,562
I WOULD GO SWEEP THAT.

674
00:19:09,562 --> 00:19:10,563
>> I DON'T CARE ABOUT

675
00:19:10,563 --> 00:19:11,426
SWEEPING THAT.

676
00:19:11,426 --> 00:19:12,668
THAT'S JUST EXTRA TIME AND--

677
00:19:12,668 --> 00:19:14,394
>> IT'S DISGUSTING.

678
00:19:14,394 --> 00:19:16,189
I'M KIND OF NUMB RIGHT NOW.

679
00:19:16,189 --> 00:19:18,398
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

680
00:19:18,398 --> 00:19:19,365
>> I'LL PROBABLY SIT IN YOUR

681
00:19:19,365 --> 00:19:20,849
ROOM AND CRY TONIGHT.

682
00:19:20,849 --> 00:19:22,161
>> DON'T DO THAT.

683
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,163
>> BEING A SINGLE MOM FOR A LONG

684
00:19:24,163 --> 00:19:27,338
TIME, I RELIED ON YOU A LOT.

685
00:19:27,338 --> 00:19:28,167
>> GIVE ME A HUG.

686
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,547
DON'T CRY.

687
00:19:29,547 --> 00:19:33,344
>> IF YOU HUG ME, I'M GONNA CRY.

688
00:19:33,344 --> 00:19:34,759
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

689
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:37,693
>> I LOVE YOU TOO.

690
00:19:37,693 --> 00:19:38,556
>> THANK YOU GUYS FOR

691
00:19:38,556 --> 00:19:39,523
HELPING US.

692
00:19:39,523 --> 00:19:40,834
>> BYE, BEN.

693
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:41,663
TAKE CARE OF HER,

694
00:19:41,663 --> 00:19:42,491
OR I'LL KILL YOU.

695
00:19:42,491 --> 00:19:44,700
[laughs]

696
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,356
>> TAKE CARE, MAN.

697
00:19:45,356 --> 00:19:47,462
>> TAKE CARE, MAN.
>> SEE YOU, MAN.

698
00:19:47,462 --> 00:19:56,436
>> SEE YOU, MAN.

699
00:19:56,436 --> 00:19:57,368
>> BEN AND I HAVE BEEN BUSY

700
00:19:57,368 --> 00:19:58,783
GETTING EVERYTHING READY FOR

701
00:19:58,783 --> 00:19:59,612
THE BABY.

702
00:19:59,612 --> 00:20:00,475
>> WANT TO HOP IN?

703
00:20:00,475 --> 00:20:01,993
>> YES.

704
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:03,271
WE COULD DO GREEN.

705
00:20:03,271 --> 00:20:04,789
GREEN'S IN THE ROOM.

706
00:20:04,789 --> 00:20:06,895
GREEN'S IN THE ROOM.
>> IT'S UP TO YOU, BABY.

707
00:20:06,895 --> 00:20:09,518
>> IT'S UP TO YOU, BABY.

708
00:20:09,518 --> 00:20:11,624
>> THAT'S THE BUMBO.

709
00:20:11,624 --> 00:20:12,797
AND THEN WE COULD SET HIM ON,

710
00:20:12,797 --> 00:20:14,454
LIKE, THE COUNTER OR SOMETHING.

711
00:20:14,454 --> 00:20:16,525
LIKE, THE COUNTER OR SOMETHING.
>> THAT IS COOL.

712
00:20:16,525 --> 00:20:19,218
>> THAT IS COOL.

713
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,391
>> MY DUE DATE IS TWO WEEKS

714
00:20:20,391 --> 00:20:21,806
AWAY, AND I'M REALLY

715
00:20:21,806 --> 00:20:22,704
UNCOMFORTABLE.

716
00:20:22,704 --> 00:20:24,119
MY FRIENDS DROVE UP TO TAKE ME

717
00:20:24,119 --> 00:20:26,155
TO THE LAKE, BUT I'M SO BIG

718
00:20:26,155 --> 00:20:27,122
THAT IT'S THE LAST PLACE

719
00:20:27,122 --> 00:20:28,468
I WANT TO BE.

720
00:20:28,468 --> 00:20:29,849
>> LOOK HOW BIG YOUR TUMMY IS.

721
00:20:29,849 --> 00:20:30,746
THAT HAS TO WEIGH A LOT.

722
00:20:30,746 --> 00:20:32,472
>> I CAN'T SEE MY TOES.

723
00:20:32,472 --> 00:20:33,784
>> YOU CAN'T SEE YOUR TOES?

724
00:20:33,784 --> 00:20:34,923
>> YEAH, LIKE, I CAN'T SEE MY

725
00:20:34,923 --> 00:20:36,476
TOES UNLESS I LEAN FORWARD OR

726
00:20:36,476 --> 00:20:37,581
BEND OVER.

727
00:20:37,581 --> 00:20:38,237
>> [laughs]

728
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,168
>> I'VE BEEN GAINING, LIKE,

729
00:20:39,168 --> 00:20:40,480
FIVE POUNDS A WEEK.

730
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:41,309
>> IT'S HEALTHY.

731
00:20:41,309 --> 00:20:42,448
>> NO, I'M SUPPOSED TO BE

732
00:20:42,448 --> 00:20:43,242
GAINING, LIKE, 1/2 POUND

733
00:20:43,242 --> 00:20:44,104
A WEEK.

734
00:20:44,104 --> 00:20:44,760
>> OH.

735
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:45,520
LIKE, HOW'S THAT MAKING YOU

736
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,210
FEEL?

737
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:47,246
ARE YOU OKAY WITH IT?

738
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,075

ASK MY DOCTOR IF I CAN BE

775
00:21:38,573 --> 00:21:39,608

807
00:22:34,007 --> 00:22:35,871
HE IS GONE THIS WEEK, SO I'M

808
00:22:35,871 --> 00:22:37,321
FILLING IN FOR HIM, OKAY?

809
00:22:37,321 --> 00:22:39,081
>> SO IS THERE ANY WAY THAT

810
00:22:39,081 --> 00:22:40,531
I COULD BE INDUCED EARLY?

811
00:22:40,531 --> 00:22:41,429
>> WHY WOULD YOU LIKE TO BE

812
00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:42,188
INDUCED?

813
00:22:42,188 --> 00:22:43,741
>> I'M UNCOMFORTABLE.

814
00:22:43,741 --> 00:22:44,742
READY TO GET IT OVER WITH.

815
00:22:44,742 --> 00:22:46,261
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT.

816
00:22:46,261 --> 00:22:47,469

00:22:55,028 --> 00:22:57,306
I'M SORRY, SWEETIE.

822
00:22:57,306 --> 00:22:59,757

00:37:18,995 --> 00:37:20,859
INTO A ROUTINE.

1290
00:37:20,859 --> 00:37:22,447
HE LOOKS AFTER TRISTAN WHEN I'M

1291
00:37:22,447 --> 00:37:25,243
AT WORK...

1292
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,554
WOULD YOU LIKE TO UPGRADE YOUR

1293
00:37:26,554 --> 00:37:28,038
FRIES TO GRINGO DIP?

1294
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:29,661
AND THEN I RUSH HOME TO TAKE

1295
00:37:29,661 --> 00:37:31,490
OVER SO HE CAN GET TO HIS SHIFT

1296
00:37:31,490 --> 00:37:32,180
IN TIME.

1297
00:37:32,180 --> 00:37:34,286
IN TIME.
>> ALL RIGHT, I LOVE YOU, BABY.

1298
00:37:34,286 --> 00:37:38,048
>> ALL RIGHT, I LOVE YOU, BABY.

1299
00:37:38,048 --> 00:37:40,948
>> IT'S A LOT TO JUGGLE, SO WE

1300
00:37:40,948 --> 00:37:42,570
HAVE TO MAKE A REAL EFFORT TO

1301
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:45,228
SPEND TIME TOGETHER.

1302
00:37:45,228 --> 00:37:46,471
DO YOU THINK OUR RELATIONSHIP

1303
00:37:46,471 --> 00:37:48,335
HAS CHANGED SINCE WE'VE HAD THE

1304
00:37:48,335 --> 00:37:49,025
BABY?

1305
00:37:49,025 --> 00:37:50,095
>> I THINK WE'RE DOING REALLY

1306
00:37:50,095 --> 00:37:51,407
GOOD FOR WHERE WE'RE AT,

1307
00:37:51,407 --> 00:37:52,615
YOU KNOW?

1308
00:37:52,615 --> 00:37:54,479
>> AND WHERE WE CAME FROM.

1309
00:37:54,479 --> 00:37:55,134
>> YEAH.

1310
00:37:55,134 --> 00:37:56,377
>> AND I THINK YOU CHANGED

1311
00:37:56,377 --> 00:37:57,447
A LOT.

1312
00:37:57,447 --> 00:37:58,448
>> I KNOW THAT.

1313
00:37:58,448 --> 00:38:00,347
I WAS LIVING FOR THE DAY,

1314
00:38:00,347 --> 00:38:01,279
YOU KNOW?

1315
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,590
LIFE'S NOT ABOUT INSTANT

1316
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:03,971
GRATIFICATION ANYMORE.

1317
00:38:03,971 --> 00:38:06,905
I GOT TO THINK ABOUT 18 YEARS

1318
00:38:06,905 --> 00:38:07,595
DOWN THE ROAD.

1319
00:38:07,595 --> 00:38:08,562
WHAT'S HE GONNA BE DOING,

1320
00:38:08,562 --> 00:38:09,528
YOU KNOW?

1321
00:38:09,528 --> 00:38:11,185
I WANT IT TO BE HIS CHOICE,

1322
00:38:11,185 --> 00:38:12,393
JUST LIKE WITH YOU.

1323
00:38:12,393 --> 00:38:13,256
>> RIGHT NOW, I HAVE NOTHING

1324
00:38:13,256 --> 00:38:13,981
GOING FOR ME.

1325
00:38:13,981 --> 00:38:15,154
I WORK AT A RESTAURANT AS AN

1326
00:38:15,154 --> 00:38:15,810
EXPRESS PERSON.

1327
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:16,466
>> YEAH, BUT I WORK AT

1328
00:38:16,466 --> 00:38:17,571
A RESTAURANT TOO.

1329
00:38:17,571 --> 00:38:19,711
>> I STILL WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL.

1330
00:38:19,711 --> 00:38:20,677
>> WHAT MAKES SCHOOL SO

1331
00:38:20,677 --> 00:38:21,368
IMPORTANT?

1332
00:38:21,368 --> 00:38:23,749
>> JUST TO HAVE, LIKE, A GOOD,

1333
00:38:23,749 --> 00:38:25,095
RELIABLE JOB.

1334
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:25,717
>> YEAH.

1335
00:38:25,717 --> 00:38:27,201
>> IT'LL BE ABOUT, LIKE, SCHOOL,

1336
00:38:27,201 --> 00:38:29,065
NOT ABOUT THE SOCIAL LIFE.

1337
00:38:29,065 --> 00:38:30,342
>> YEAH.

1338
00:38:30,342 --> 00:38:31,861
YOU DON'T SEE YOURSELF EVER

1339
00:38:31,861 --> 00:38:34,242
FINDING NEW FRIENDS UP HERE,

1340
00:38:34,242 --> 00:38:36,452
YOU KNOW?

1341
00:38:36,452 --> 00:38:37,901
>> I THOUGHT IT'D BE EASIER TO

1342
00:38:37,901 --> 00:38:40,179
MAKE FRIENDS AT MY NEW JOB.

1343
00:38:40,179 --> 00:38:41,698
EVERYBODY IN THE RESTAURANT

1344
00:38:41,698 --> 00:38:43,321
IS GONNA WANT TO GO PARTY,

1345
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,219
AND I CAN'T DO THAT.

1346
00:38:45,219 --> 00:38:47,048
>> YOU'RE MAKING IT SOUND LIKE

1347
00:38:47,048 --> 00:38:48,636
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA MAKE FRIENDS

1348
00:38:48,636 --> 00:38:49,327
AGAIN.

1349
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,362
>> THE REASON I DON'T FEEL

1350
00:38:50,362 --> 00:38:52,053
LIKE I CAN MAKE ANY FRIENDS

1351
00:38:52,053 --> 00:38:53,952
IS BECAUSE I'M DIFFERENT THAN

1352
00:38:53,952 --> 00:38:55,678
EVERY OTHER TEENAGER, YOU KNOW?

1353
00:38:55,678 --> 00:38:56,334
>> YEAH.

1354
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,163
>> MOST TEENAGERS DON'T HAVE

1355
00:38:58,163 --> 00:39:00,890
A TWO-MONTH-OLD.

1356
00:39:00,890 --> 00:39:02,340
AND, LIKE, WE DON'T HAVE THE

1357
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,342
SAME COMMON INTERESTS.

1358
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,378
SAME COMMON INTERESTS.
LIKE, EVERYTHING'S CHANGED.

1359
00:39:06,378 --> 00:39:10,002
LIKE, EVERYTHING'S CHANGED.

1360
00:39:10,002 --> 00:39:11,349
I DON'T REALLY FEEL LIKE A

1361
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:13,005
TEENAGER ANYMORE JUST BECAUSE I

1362
00:39:13,005 --> 00:39:14,628
HAVE A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITIES,

1363
00:39:14,628 --> 00:39:16,906
LIKE PAYING THE BILLS AND TAKING

1364
00:39:16,906 --> 00:39:19,598
CARE OF ANOTHER PERSON.

1365
00:39:19,598 --> 00:39:21,462
IT'S REALLY HARD.

1366
00:39:21,462 --> 00:39:24,534
[Tristan crying]

1367
00:39:24,534 --> 00:39:26,018
SOMETIMES HE JUST CRIES, AND YOU

1368
00:39:26,018 --> 00:39:27,365
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH HIM,

1369
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,262
AND YOU JUST GET REALLY

1370
00:39:28,262 --> 00:39:30,195
STRESSED.

1371
00:39:30,195 --> 00:39:32,404
I FEEL LIKE I'VE HAD TO GIVE UP

1372
00:39:32,404 --> 00:39:34,164
MY SOCIAL LIFE.

1373
00:39:34,164 --> 00:39:35,718
I DON'T REALLY TALK TO MOST OF

1374
00:39:35,718 --> 00:39:38,341
MY FRIENDS ANYMORE.

1375
00:39:38,341 --> 00:39:39,653
>> DOES IT MAKE YOU SAD THAT

1376
00:39:39,653 --> 00:39:41,620
ALL YOUR FRIENDS ARE AT COLLEGE

1377
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:42,310
AND THAT YOU'RE NOT?

1378
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:42,966
>> YEAH.

1379
00:39:42,966 --> 00:39:44,347
>> WELL, HERE'S THE SAD PART:

1380
00:39:44,347 --> 00:39:45,831
YOU WERE SO CLOSE WITH ALL OF

1381
00:39:45,831 --> 00:39:47,764
THESE GIRLS, AND IT'S GONNA BE

1382
00:39:47,764 --> 00:39:49,421
REALLY HARD TO KEEP IN TOUCH

1383
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:51,043
WITH ALL OF THEM.

1384
00:39:51,043 --> 00:39:52,735
>> I THINK IF I WENT TO COLLEGE

1385
00:39:52,735 --> 00:39:54,357
NOW, IT WOULD BE A LOT HARDER,

1386
00:39:54,357 --> 00:39:56,394
JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO TAKE

1387
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:57,878
CARE OF A CRYING BABY WHILE

1388
00:39:57,878 --> 00:39:58,534
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO YOUR

1389
00:39:58,534 --> 00:40:01,019
HOMEWORK, AND I THINK IT'D BE

1390
00:40:01,019 --> 00:40:02,400
TEN TIMES HARDER.

1391
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:05,230
BREATHE.

1392
00:40:05,230 --> 00:40:06,714
IT WAS HARD LISTENING TO MY

1393
00:40:06,714 --> 00:40:08,509
FRIENDS AND FAMILY BE LIKE,

1394
00:40:08,509 --> 00:40:10,718
"BEN'S NOT GONNA COME AROUND."

1395
00:40:10,718 --> 00:40:13,480
LIKE, "DON'T GET YOUR HOPES UP."

1396
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:15,343
BUT BEN AND I HAVE MADE IT WORK

1397
00:40:15,343 --> 00:40:17,311
BECAUSE WE ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT

1398
00:40:17,311 --> 00:40:18,139
EACH OTHER.

1399
00:40:18,139 --> 00:40:19,347
>> I CAN PUT A PILLOW UNDER YOUR

1400
00:40:19,347 --> 00:40:20,901
BUTT IF YOU WANT ME TO.

1401
00:40:20,901 --> 00:40:22,696
>> SOMETIMES I THINK A LOT OF

1402
00:40:22,696 --> 00:40:25,008
TEENAGE COUPLES JUST ARE

1403
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:28,598
TOGETHER FOR THEIR BABIES, BUT I

1404
00:40:28,598 --> 00:40:30,013
THINK IT TAKES MORE THAN JUST

1405
00:40:30,013 --> 00:40:31,429
BEING TOGETHER FOR YOUR BABY.

1406
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,430
>> HE SAYS, "I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S

1407
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,190
GOING ON, BUT I DON'T LIKE IT."

1408
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:36,330
>> I REALLY HOPE ME AND BEN

1409
00:40:36,330 --> 00:40:37,607
MAKE IT.

1410
00:40:37,607 --> 00:40:38,884
THINGS ARE GOING GREAT RIGHT

1411
00:40:38,884 --> 00:40:40,127
NOW, AND I'M NOT SURE HOW

1412
00:40:40,127 --> 00:40:41,300
THEY'LL BE IN THE FUTURE,

1413
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:42,750
BUT ALL I CAN DO IS HOPE FOR

1414
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,821
BUT ALL I CAN DO IS HOPE FOR
THE BEST.

1415
00:40:44,821 --> 00:41:00,112
THE BEST.

1416
00:41:00,112 --> 00:41:01,459
>> DID HE BUY THE TICKETS YET?

1417
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,219
>> NO, HE'S WAITING TO BUY THEM.

1418
00:41:03,219 --> 00:41:05,014
>> HOW MANY TIMES DID HE PROMISE

1419
00:41:05,014 --> 00:41:06,256
TO COME OUT ALREADY?

1420
00:41:06,256 --> 00:41:08,362
>> JUST GET OUT, PLEASE!

1421
00:41:08,362 --> 00:41:09,018
JUST--

1422
00:41:09,018 --> 00:41:11,158
>> OH, MY GOD!

1423
00:41:11,158 --> 00:41:12,711
OH, SHE'S TURNING PURPLE.

1424
00:41:12,711 --> 00:41:13,609
>> WE NEED NICU NOW.

1425
00:41:13,609 --> 00:41:14,299
NOW.

1426
00:41:14,299 --> 00:41:16,370
NOW.
>> GOD, LORD, JESUS!
