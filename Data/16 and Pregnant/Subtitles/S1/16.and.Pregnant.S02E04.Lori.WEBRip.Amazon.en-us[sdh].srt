I live in this house with

my birth mother.

Cory and I started fighting

56
00:01:23,617 --> 00:01:25,253
all the time, and we broke up.

00:01:25,253 --> 00:01:26,220
Get the fishies.

58
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,555
But now we need to set aside

59
00:01:27,555 --> 00:01:29,557
our differences and make a plan.

60
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:33,327

00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:36,063
They don't want to be parents

00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:36,930
again.

64
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:37,965
>> Yeah.

65
00:01:37,965 --> 00:01:38,832
When we first found out,

66
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:40,268
I was up for the adoption,

67
00:01:40,268 --> 00:01:41,735
even closed at that point,

68
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:43,671

00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:47,775
I'm keeping him.

>> I feel the exact same way.

72
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:50,678
And with, like, us, we just

73
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:51,945
kind of stopped talking,

74
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:52,846
'cause every time we did,

75
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:53,714
we'd argue.

76
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:54,615
>> I was pissed.

77
00:01:54,615 --> 00:01:55,649
>> Yeah.

00:01:55,649 --> 00:01:56,584
We can get along.

00:01:57,585 --> 00:01:58,586
We did for a year.

00:01:58,586 --> 00:02:01,088
We were actually really close.

00:02:01,088 --> 00:02:02,690

84
00:02:04,925 --> 00:02:06,694
a lot--a lot that we have got

00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:11,131
a lot of trouble.

Scary is an understatement.

when they found out.

95
00:02:21,074 --> 00:02:22,343
They think Cory and I are

96
00:02:22,343 --> 00:02:24,144
way too young to be parents

97
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,313
and have been talking to me

98
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:27,948
a lot about choosing adoption.

99
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,683

100
00:02:29,683 --> 00:02:30,451
>> Killed me?

00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:31,919
>> Thrown up

102
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,954
right there on the spot.

103
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:36,357
>> And I became physically ill.

104
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:39,393
>> You know, my gut response

105
00:02:39,393 --> 00:02:41,161
was, "we need to make this

106
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,230
go away."

107
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,096
>> Yeah.

108
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:44,798
>> I, you know, I'm kind of

109
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:46,200
against abortion.

110
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,768
I've always said that,

111
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:49,036
and then when she came and told

112
00:02:49,036 --> 00:02:51,104
me this, I'm thinking, you know,

113
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,440
this is really gonna test

114
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,707
my beliefs in everything.

115
00:02:53,707 --> 00:02:54,842
>> Well, I couldn't, because,

116
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:57,245
like, my birth mom was in the

117
00:02:57,245 --> 00:02:58,346
same situation 17 years ago.

118
00:02:58,346 --> 00:02:59,247
>> Right.

119
00:02:59,247 --> 00:03:00,147
>> She could have said,

120
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:01,014
"I want an abortion."

121
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:01,882
And then...

122
00:03:01,882 --> 00:03:02,916
>> And you wouldn't be here.

123
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,051
>> I wouldn't be here.

124
00:03:04,051 --> 00:03:05,953
>> When we first started

125
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:07,955
discussing adoption versus

126
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:09,990
parenting, it's consumed us

127
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,091
since the day we found out

128
00:03:11,091 --> 00:03:11,959
about this.

129
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:12,826
And that's, I think,

130
00:03:12,826 --> 00:03:14,127
what makes it really painful,

131
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,796
is that this would normally be

132
00:03:15,796 --> 00:03:16,997
a real joyous thing.

133
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:18,299
We'd be jumping up and down.

134
00:03:18,299 --> 00:03:20,000
But the circumstances--

135
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,035
just it's--

136
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:22,903
>> They're not right.

137
00:03:22,903 --> 00:03:26,139
>> They're not right.

138
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,175
>> I obviously don't have

139
00:03:28,175 --> 00:03:29,209
my parents' support in keeping

140
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,279
this baby.

141
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:32,813
Luckily I have my best friend

142
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,415
Alexa, who's really excited

143
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:35,283
about the idea of me being

144
00:03:35,283 --> 00:03:36,250
a mom.

145
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:37,885
>> You're gonna be a mommy.

146
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:39,587
>> Oh, my God.

147
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:41,455
I think for me, I mean,

148
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:42,956
I don't have any, like, actual,

149
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,892
like, biological blood-related

150
00:03:44,892 --> 00:03:46,360
family right now.

151
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:48,362
And, like, I think that plays

152
00:03:48,362 --> 00:03:49,363
kind of in the role with the

153
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:50,864
whole, like, putting him up

154
00:03:50,864 --> 00:03:51,999
for adoption thing,

155
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:53,534
the fact that for the first

156
00:03:53,534 --> 00:03:58,939
time, I have actual family,

157
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:01,309
then I just give it away.

158
00:04:01,309 --> 00:04:02,276
I think Cory kind of feels

159
00:04:02,276 --> 00:04:03,143
the same way.

160
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:04,111
I mean, I wonder, like,

161
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:05,245
had, like, I not been the one

162
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,113
to walk away from the

163
00:04:06,113 --> 00:04:06,980
relationship...

164
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:07,948
>> I think it would still

165
00:04:07,948 --> 00:04:09,082
be over.

166
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,117
>> I think there was part of me

167
00:04:10,117 --> 00:04:10,984
that wishes we would get

168
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,386
back together.

169
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:14,488
But there's still that voice

170
00:04:14,488 --> 00:04:15,389
in my head saying,

171
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:16,357
"You're retarded.

172
00:04:16,357 --> 00:04:17,358
Get over it."

173
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:18,225
>> That's my voice.

174
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:19,126
>> Shut up.

175
00:04:19,126 --> 00:04:19,993
That ain't your voice.

176
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,929
Your voice is too squeaky.

177
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:24,298
>> Why does everyone say that?

178
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:25,999
>> It's the start of my

179
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:27,301
senior year.

180
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:28,702
Sometimes I forget I'm still

181
00:04:28,702 --> 00:04:29,637
a teenager.

182
00:04:29,637 --> 00:04:31,972
I don't want to go to school.

183
00:04:31,972 --> 00:04:32,940
>> Do you ever want to go

184
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,607
to school?

185
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:34,608
>> Even though I go to

186
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:35,576
a private Catholic high school,

187
00:04:35,576 --> 00:04:37,077
people seem to be accepting

188
00:04:37,077 --> 00:04:38,446
of my pregnancy.

189
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:39,313
See you.

190
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:40,614
Oh, I don't want--

191
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,583
>> Good morning, ladies.

192
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,585
Monday, we want this final

193

00:10:06,173 --> 00:10:07,207
>> Okay.

383
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:08,208
[chime dings]

384
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,210
Cory's master plan is for me

385
00:10:10,210 --> 00:10:11,879
and the baby to move in with him

386
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,113
and his roommate, Ashley.

387
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:14,314
It's not the best plan,

388
00:10:14,314 --> 00:10:16,216
but it's the only one we've got.

389
00:10:16,216 --> 00:10:17,450
He saw the pictures.

390
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:18,418
>> So does that make you change

391
00:10:18,418 --> 00:10:19,452
your mind, or what's that do

392
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:20,320
to you?

393
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,188
>> Yeah, now it's gonna

394
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:22,189
be harder.

395
00:10:22,189 --> 00:10:23,090
>> I think we're just gonna

396
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,158
continue exploring both sides.

397
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:26,259
>> Maybe look at some profiles

398
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:27,728
just to get a feel for what...

399
00:10:27,728 --> 00:10:28,395
>> Mm-hmm.

400
00:10:28,395 --> 00:10:30,430
>> I mean, what we'd be doing.

401
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,800
>> Okay, I have a question.

402
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,101
If you're thinking about

403
00:10:34,101 --> 00:10:37,270
parenting, are you two together?

404
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:39,406
I mean, are you going to

405
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:40,273
live together?

406
00:10:40,273 --> 00:10:41,141
Are you going to live

407
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:42,009
separately?

408
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:42,876
>> Would there be, like,

409
00:10:42,876 --> 00:10:43,744
custody?

410
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:44,477
>> Have you even thought

411
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:45,278
that far?

412
00:10:45,278 --> 00:10:46,146
>> It's still--we have.

413
00:10:46,146 --> 00:10:47,014
We have talked a little bit

414
00:10:47,014 --> 00:10:47,881
about it.

415
00:10:47,881 --> 00:10:48,749
>> No, we've talked about it,

416
00:10:48,749 --> 00:10:49,516
but that's up in the air.

417
00:10:49,516 --> 00:10:50,317
>> We just now got back onto

418
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:51,484
good terms, so we're still

419
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,753
working into everything

420
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:53,921
really slowly.

421
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:54,855
>> Because, you know, there's no

422
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:55,655
point in staying together--

423
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,456
>> That shouldn't be our--

424
00:10:56,456 --> 00:10:57,324
that's not really our main--

425
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:58,291
>> Now's the time when you

426
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:00,327
really have to sit down and get

427
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:01,428
some details worked out.

428
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:02,295
I'm telling you.

429
00:11:02,295 --> 00:11:03,463
>> Well, I mean, you're there

430
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:04,798
freaking out, but--

431
00:11:04,798 --> 00:11:06,566
>> I am freaking out because

432
00:11:06,566 --> 00:11:08,936
this baby is on a schedule,

433
00:11:08,936 --> 00:11:09,803
you know?

434
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:10,503
>> Well, let's say,

435
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:11,371
at least two months.

436
00:11:11,371 --> 00:11:12,239
>> Two months?

437
00:11:12,239 --> 00:11:13,340
>> Parenting--I'm just telling

438
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,207
you, you've got a lot to do.

439
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:15,075
>> Yes, two months.

440
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:15,943
>> You can't start, like,

441
00:11:15,943 --> 00:11:16,810
jumping on us now.

442
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:17,845
Like, we're open to, like,

443
00:11:17,845 --> 00:11:19,312
looking at open adoption,

444
00:11:19,312 --> 00:11:20,513
but you also have to be open

445
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,849
to where we're coming from

446
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,050
and what we want to--

447
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:23,917
>> I am open to it.

448
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:27,520
>> You both need reality.

449
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,889
>> But what if the reality is

450
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:30,824
I want to keep this baby?

451
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:41,068
>> The past week at home

452
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:42,602
has been tense.

453
00:11:42,602 --> 00:11:43,904
Since Cory made the offer

454
00:11:43,904 --> 00:11:45,605
for me to move in with the baby,

455
00:11:45,605 --> 00:11:47,274
he hasn't been in touch at all

456
00:11:47,274 --> 00:11:48,375
about his plan.

457
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:49,542
>> Have you talked to Cory

458
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,410
today?

459
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:51,311
>> I don't know what's going on

460
00:11:51,311 --> 00:11:52,179
with him.

461
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:53,413
I don't know anything right now.

462
00:11:53,413 --> 00:11:55,482
>> Oh...

463
00:11:55,482 --> 00:11:56,583
>> You guys have to have

464
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,451
dialogue regarding this.

465
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,253
You know, because as delivery

466
00:12:00,253 --> 00:12:02,155
approaches, I don't want him

467
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:04,224
to have some emotional deal

468
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,993
going, and I mean, he has

469
00:12:05,993 --> 00:12:07,627
to get it together.

470
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:09,396
>> And so do you.

471
00:12:09,396 --> 00:12:10,330
I just think that you need

472
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:13,166
to set priorities and check out

473
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,568
everything that's available to

474
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:18,005
you, so you have no regrets,

475
00:12:18,005 --> 00:12:19,506
saying, "Gee, I wish I would

476
00:12:19,506 --> 00:12:24,277
have done that."

477
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:26,179
>> My parents thought it would

478
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:27,214
help me to meet someone who

479
00:12:27,214 --> 00:12:28,081
actually chose open adoption

480
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,449
for their baby.

481
00:12:29,449 --> 00:12:30,317
Liz is here.

482
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:31,184
>> Hey.

483
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:32,052
>> Hi.

484
00:12:32,052 --> 00:12:32,719
How are you?

485
00:12:32,719 --> 00:12:33,586
>> Good.

486
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:34,454
>> So they called our family

487
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:35,522
friend Liz, a girl who went

488
00:12:35,522 --> 00:12:36,389
through the same thing

489
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,225
that I did.

490
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:40,260
>> How did you come to that

491
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:43,530
decision to do an open adoption?

492
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:45,265
>> I just found out about

493
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,733
open adoption, and it kind of

494
00:12:46,733 --> 00:12:47,600
was really interesting.

495
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,701
That's your first parental

496
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:49,769
decision.

497
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,271
You know, like, I made the most

498
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,239
important decision.

499
00:12:52,239 --> 00:12:53,273
You're gonna make it,

500
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,541
whatever you decide.

501
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,775
>> You know, to achieve what you

502
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,078
want to achieve and parent

503
00:12:58,078 --> 00:12:59,546
as a teenager, it's just

504
00:12:59,546 --> 00:13:00,747
impossible.

505
00:13:00,747 --> 00:13:02,249
>> I mean, I would not be able

506
00:13:02,249 --> 00:13:03,116
to do it.

507
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,184
There's no way.

508
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:05,652
It would not be possible.

509
00:13:05,652 --> 00:13:06,519
>> I keep telling her,

510
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,387
it's the best of both worlds.

511
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:08,588
>> That's what my mom said

512
00:13:08,588 --> 00:13:09,456
to me too.

513
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,323
>> Yeah, it is.

514
00:13:10,323 --> 00:13:11,558
>> It's the best of both worlds.

515
00:13:11,558 --> 00:13:12,425
>> It is, to be able to--

516
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:13,293
>> That should be your

517
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:14,161
theme song.

518
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:14,862
>> I didn't even know

519
00:13:14,862 --> 00:13:15,695
it was a song.

520
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:16,563
>> Hannah Montana.

521
00:13:16,563 --> 00:13:17,464
>> Is it really a song?

522
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:18,531
Yeah, Hannah Montana.

523
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:19,599
>> Just the fact that she knows

524
00:13:19,599 --> 00:13:22,335
a Hannah Montana song should

525
00:13:22,335 --> 00:13:23,736
make her ineligible to parent

526
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:27,174
at this age.

527
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:28,408
But now the family that you

528
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:29,676
chose wasn't through Catholic

529
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:30,543
Social--that's surprising.

530
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:31,411
>> No.

531
00:13:31,411 --> 00:13:32,645
>> How did that come about?

532
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,513
>> We just kind of looked

533
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:34,381
on our own and...

534
00:13:34,381 --> 00:13:35,248
>> Wow.

535
00:13:35,248 --> 00:13:37,117
>> Found Brian and Jen, yeah.

536
00:13:37,117 --> 00:13:37,851
>> That's some divine

537
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:38,718
intervention.

538
00:13:38,718 --> 00:13:39,586
>> Oh, yeah.

539
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:41,121
And also they do have

540
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:42,555
a desire to adopt again.

541
00:13:42,555 --> 00:13:43,423
>> Mm-hmm.

542
00:13:43,423 --> 00:13:45,258
>> And if everything were to

543
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:46,226
work out that way...

544
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:47,160
>> Yeah.

545
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,228
>> You know, you could be

546
00:13:48,228 --> 00:13:50,730
birth mom number two.

547
00:13:50,730 --> 00:13:51,798
[chime dings]

548
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:52,900
>> Talking with Liz really

549
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,234
opened my eyes to the

550
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:55,903
possibility of open adoption.

551
00:13:55,903 --> 00:13:57,204
But I'm still not sold

552
00:13:57,204 --> 00:13:58,538
and neither is Cory

553
00:13:58,538 --> 00:14:00,207
as my mom found out when she

554
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:01,208
called him to see where he stood

555
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:01,875
on things.

556
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,776
[line rings]

557
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:05,378
Cory told my mom that he was

558
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:06,579
pretty set on keeping the baby

559
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:07,747
after all.

560
00:14:07,747 --> 00:14:08,815
>> Oh, my God.

561
00:14:08,815 --> 00:14:10,250
You don't want anyone else

562
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,352
raising your kid.

563
00:14:12,352 --> 00:14:13,286
>> I can tell you,

564
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:14,922
it's gonna be a disaster.

565
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:17,490
So she needs--

566
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:18,926
>> Yes, I do know that.

567
00:14:18,926 --> 00:14:21,361
I do know that, Cory.

568
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:22,795
Okay, well, I just talked

569
00:14:22,795 --> 00:14:23,763
to Cory.

570
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:24,631
>> Yeah?

571
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:27,634
>> And he tells me that you two

572
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:29,602
are gonna keep this baby

573
00:14:29,602 --> 00:14:34,441
and that you are going to

574
00:14:34,441 --> 00:14:37,277
move into his apartment.

575
00:14:37,277 --> 00:14:38,478
>> It's just something that

576
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:39,913
we've been considering recently.

577
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:40,880
>> You know, I'm not even--

578
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,649
as con--so much concerned

579
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:44,517
about you in raising this child

580
00:14:44,517 --> 00:14:46,486
as I am Cory,

581
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:47,887
because he's not followed

582
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,690
through on one promise since

583
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:51,558
I've known him.

584
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:53,826
>> If you truly think that this

585
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:54,727
is something that you're

586
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:57,297
considering, you need to go out

587
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:58,731
there, and you need to live

588
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,001
with him and see what

589
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:03,470
a disastrous situation you're

590
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,372
putting yourself in before this

591
00:15:05,372 --> 00:15:07,440
innocent baby is brought into

592
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,708
this world.

593
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,577
We're setting a deadline.

594
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:11,744
This needs to be done by

595
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,080
the end of this week.

596
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,114
>> That's fine with me.

597
00:15:14,114 --> 00:15:17,850
I'll talk to him tonight.

598
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,386
>> [sighs]

599
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:20,620
>> My parents seem to think

600
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,789
this is an obvious decision,

601
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:24,124
but it's much more complicated

602
00:15:24,124 --> 00:15:24,992
than that.

603
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:25,858
[line ringing]

604
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:27,527
I'm on my way over now.

605
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:29,862
My parents and I had our

606
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:31,798
family discussion tonight.

607
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:35,468
>> [sighs]

608
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:37,037
It went--it was pretty scary.

609
00:15:37,037 --> 00:15:40,007
So you and I got some talking

610
00:15:40,007 --> 00:15:41,641
to do.

611
00:15:41,641 --> 00:15:42,642
I will talk about it when

612
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:43,510
I get there.

613
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,711
How's that?

614
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:45,578
>> All right.

615
00:15:45,578 --> 00:15:48,648
>> Okay.

616
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:49,949
I need to talk to Cory

617
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,484
face-to-face.

618
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:52,685
We have to make these decisions

619
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,087
together.

620
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:56,156
>> What did your parents say?

621
00:15:56,156 --> 00:15:57,524
>> My mom's still on her whole

622
00:15:57,524 --> 00:15:58,458
thing, "If this is what you're

623
00:15:58,458 --> 00:15:59,192
gonna do, then you need

624
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:00,127
to do it now."

625
00:16:00,127 --> 00:16:03,130
But the catch is, we have a week

626
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:07,667
to give them a final answer.

627
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:09,236
>> I have my final answer

628
00:16:09,236 --> 00:16:10,903
whether they like it or not.

629
00:16:10,903 --> 00:16:12,539
I'm keeping him.

630
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:14,007
>> This is why if we're sure

631
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:16,976
about coming here, we have

632
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,546
really got to get moving here.

633
00:16:19,546 --> 00:16:22,049
>> It's not just up to me.

634
00:16:22,049 --> 00:16:23,716
I have a roommate.

635
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:25,085
>> Well, you said she was

636
00:16:25,085 --> 00:16:26,553
perfectly fine with it.

637
00:16:26,553 --> 00:16:27,720
>> She--I was supposed to talk

638
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,588
to her Friday.

639
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:29,289
She ain't been home in

640
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:30,123
a [bleep] week.

641
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:32,592
>> I don't know.

642
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:33,826
Why did you throw out

643
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:34,794
the opportunity for us

644
00:16:34,794 --> 00:16:35,928
to stay here?

645
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:36,796
>> 'Cause you have nowhere

646
00:16:36,796 --> 00:16:38,865
else to go.

647
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,738
>> I got to know where you

648
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:47,607
stand with this offer.

649
00:16:47,607 --> 00:16:48,608
>> I got to talk to Ashley.

650
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:49,309
I'm fine with it, but

651
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:50,143
I don't know where my

652
00:16:50,143 --> 00:16:51,544
roommate is.

653
00:16:51,544 --> 00:16:52,779
>> Well, you should find out,

654
00:16:52,779 --> 00:16:55,248
like, this week.

655
00:16:55,248 --> 00:16:56,216
>> When she comes home tonight,

656
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:57,950
I'll talk to her.

657
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:59,886
>> I got to go.

658
00:17:03,956 --> 00:17:04,824
[sniffs]

659
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:08,595
[door clicks open]

660
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:10,230
Living with Cory might not

661
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:12,065
be an option after all.

662
00:17:12,065 --> 00:17:13,300
How can I raise this baby

663
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,268
if I have nowhere to go?

664
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:23,943
>> I couldn't believe how Cory

665
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:25,011
was acting last night.

666
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:26,279
It made me start to think

667
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,180
about what kind of dad

668
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,248
he would be.

669
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:29,116
I went out there, and I was

670
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:29,982
talking to him.

671
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:30,883
You know how he gets.

672
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,785
And, like, by, like,

673
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:34,354
halfway through, his temper

674
00:17:34,354 --> 00:17:35,255
started.

675
00:17:35,255 --> 00:17:36,223
I really don't know where

676
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:37,157
he stands.

677
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:38,491
>> Well, he also is just now

678
00:17:38,491 --> 00:17:39,892
realizing that you're pregnant,

679
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:41,828
and I think that's ridiculous.

680
00:17:41,828 --> 00:17:42,762
>> That's why I'm still gonna

681
00:17:42,762 --> 00:17:44,331
pursue open adoption.

682
00:17:44,331 --> 00:17:47,500
>> I just think that you can

683
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,436
give this baby a really

684
00:17:49,436 --> 00:17:50,303
good life.

685
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:51,804
>> I mean, I have to.

686
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:52,772
No matter what, I have

687
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:53,473
to look at it.

688
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:55,808
Yeah.

689
00:17:55,808 --> 00:17:57,877
Just to be safe, I decided to

690
00:17:57,877 --> 00:17:58,945
meet with Jen and Brian.

691
00:17:58,945 --> 00:18:00,447
I want to see if they might

692
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:02,182
make cool adoptive parents.

693
00:18:02,182 --> 00:18:03,383
>> Okay, well, you ready

694
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:04,317
for this?

695
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:05,485
>> I'm so nervous.

696
00:18:05,485 --> 00:18:07,487
>> Remember, all you're doing...

697
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,388
>> Is meeting them.

698
00:18:08,388 --> 00:18:09,256
>> Is meeting them.

699
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:10,123
>> I know.

700
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:10,990
>> And Liz is just gonna show

701
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:12,859
you how it works for her.

702
00:18:12,859 --> 00:18:13,860
>> I think I'm more comfortable

703
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:16,129
that she's gonna be there.

704
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:18,097
Since I can't rely on Cory

705
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:19,199
at the moment, I need

706
00:18:19,199 --> 00:18:20,533
to reconsider all of my options

707
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:24,003
including open adoption.

708
00:18:24,003 --> 00:18:25,071
>> Hi.

709
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:26,139
>> I'm Lori.

710
00:18:26,139 --> 00:18:27,274
>> I'm Jennifer.

711
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:28,141
>> Hey, Liz.

712
00:18:28,141 --> 00:18:29,008
>> Hey.

713
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:30,109
>> So we're just gonna talk

714
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,144
about open adoption.

715
00:18:31,144 --> 00:18:32,011
Is that okay?

716
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:32,879
>> Yes, that is fine.

717
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:33,546
>> Okay.

718
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:34,847
I had to trust her.

719
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:35,848
>> Yeah.

720
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:37,150
>> And she had to trust me,

721
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,018
that we were going to go forward

722
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:41,588
with the openness of it, and

723
00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:43,390
we've never regretted it since.

724
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,257
>> Yeah.

725
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:46,859
>> We've always kept that door

726
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,361
open and always thought about

727
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:51,198
the possibility of doing

728
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:52,165
another adoption.

729
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:53,333
>> I want to explore every

730
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,435
option, just so I don't make

731
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:56,469
a decision and think,

732
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:57,370
"Oh, I wish I would have done--

733
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,505
looked into this a little more."

734
00:18:58,505 --> 00:18:59,439
>> Oh, definitely.

735
00:18:59,439 --> 00:19:01,040
>> I want to be pretty much

736
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,375
dead set.

737
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:03,676
>> If I didn't know for sure

738
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,412
that that's what Liz really

739
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:07,347
wanted, it just would have been

740
00:19:07,347 --> 00:19:08,248
really, really hard.

741
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:09,115
>> Yeah.

742
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:11,284
>> So I encourage you to really

743
00:19:11,284 --> 00:19:12,985
make sure that you do what

744
00:19:12,985 --> 00:19:13,686
you're wanting to do.

745
00:19:13,686 --> 00:19:14,521
>> Yeah.

746
00:19:14,521 --> 00:19:15,422
>> Don't do it just because

747
00:19:15,422 --> 00:19:16,289
somebody else wants you

748
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:17,324
to do it.

749
00:19:17,324 --> 00:19:20,059
>> I've heard that a lot.

750
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:21,594
And the truth is, I still

751
00:19:21,594 --> 00:19:22,562
don't know what I want to do,

752
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:23,996
which is what I've told

753
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:24,997
my parents.

754
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:26,266
Like, I told them, we just want

755
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:28,134
to do everything we can to

756
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:29,336
explore both sides, just so

757
00:19:29,336 --> 00:19:30,203
we have no regrets.

758
00:19:30,203 --> 00:19:31,638
And my friends, who still want

759
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:33,306
to throw me a baby shower.

760
00:19:33,306 --> 00:19:36,476
>> Lori.

761
00:19:36,476 --> 00:19:38,144
>> Y'all are real funny.

762
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:39,279
But I don't want to have

763
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,313
the baby shower behind

764
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:41,248
my mother's back.

765
00:19:41,248 --> 00:19:42,415
Hey, Mom.

766
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:43,983
So we decided to tell my mom

767
00:19:43,983 --> 00:19:45,051
in hopes that she would change

768
00:19:45,051 --> 00:19:47,720
her mind.

769
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,588
>> Alexa just wanted

770
00:19:48,588 --> 00:19:49,689
to talk to you.

771
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,625
>> Okay, so me and Lauren want

772
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,362
to have a baby shower for Lori.

773
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:56,363
>> Mom, I wanted you to know

774
00:19:56,363 --> 00:19:58,231
so that if you...

775
00:19:58,231 --> 00:19:59,766
>> Wanted to go or help plan it.

776
00:19:59,766 --> 00:20:01,200
>> Wanted you to be there.

777
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,201
>> You're gonna keep

778
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,404
this baby, aren't you?

779
00:20:04,404 --> 00:20:07,073
I mean, why are we playing

780
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:08,508
these games, Lori?

781
00:20:08,508 --> 00:20:10,410
>> Mom, I'm really not

782
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:11,544
decided yet.

783
00:20:11,544 --> 00:20:13,413
>> We need to be honest.

784
00:20:13,413 --> 00:20:14,681
>> I-I'm being honest.

785
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:15,748
I really haven't completely

786
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:16,683
decided yet.

787
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:18,184
That's why we told you

788
00:20:18,184 --> 00:20:19,051
about this.

789
00:20:19,051 --> 00:20:20,253
>> And it is utterly ridiculous

790
00:20:20,253 --> 00:20:22,689
to have a baby shower unless you

791
00:20:22,689 --> 00:20:24,324
know you're planning on keeping

792
00:20:24,324 --> 00:20:25,358
this baby.

793
00:20:25,358 --> 00:20:26,826
>> And if I end up not keeping

794
00:20:26,826 --> 00:20:28,661
him, then I can give it to

795
00:20:28,661 --> 00:20:29,629
the family that adopts him.

796
00:20:29,629 --> 00:20:31,130
>> Oh, God.

797
00:20:31,130 --> 00:20:32,299
I'm sick of it.

798
00:20:32,299 --> 00:20:33,165
I'm just--I'm--

799
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:36,403
I'm at my wit's end.

800
00:20:36,403 --> 00:20:38,505
I can't take any more.

801
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:41,207
You need to be honest with me.

802
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:47,179
>> I am being honest.

803
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:48,348
>> I don't want to be a part

804
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:50,283
of any baby shower.

805
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:58,525
>> My mom was so upset that she

806
00:20:58,525 --> 00:20:59,459
told my dad to call Cory to get

807
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:00,827
some answers.

808
00:21:00,827 --> 00:21:04,331
>> Cory, has Lori been able

809
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:06,899
to get ahold of you today?

810
00:21:06,899 --> 00:21:08,735
I mean, I think she really

811
00:21:08,735 --> 00:21:11,304
hasn't made any plans as to how

812
00:21:11,304 --> 00:21:12,872
she's gonna do it.

813
00:21:12,872 --> 00:21:15,908
So I mean, are you thinking

814
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:16,843
you want to parent?

815
00:21:16,843 --> 00:21:18,478
Do you want to do this open

816
00:21:18,478 --> 00:21:22,682
adoption thing?

817
00:21:22,682 --> 00:21:23,783
Oh, that would be excellent.

818
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:26,252
Jen and Brian want you to be

819
00:21:26,252 --> 00:21:28,521
a part of this child's life.

820
00:21:28,521 --> 00:21:29,589
Okay.

821
00:21:29,589 --> 00:21:31,558
We'll just go from there.

822
00:21:31,558 --> 00:21:33,259
Okay, I'll see you, buddy.

823
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:34,727
Bye.

824
00:21:34,727 --> 00:21:37,397
>> Hey, Lori.

825
00:21:37,397 --> 00:21:38,264
>> Come here.

826
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:39,566
We need to talk to you.

827
00:21:39,566 --> 00:21:43,603
>> Yeah, I'm coming.

828
00:21:43,603 --> 00:21:46,773
>> I got ahold of Cory finally.

829
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:47,774
>> Yeah?

830
00:21:47,774 --> 00:21:50,443
>> And I asked him what you guys

831
00:21:50,443 --> 00:21:51,878
are planning to do,

832
00:21:51,878 --> 00:21:54,981
and he said that he's convinced

833
00:21:54,981 --> 00:21:57,049
that there's no way that

834
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,718
you guys can parent.

835
00:21:58,718 --> 00:21:59,652
He told me that.

836
00:21:59,652 --> 00:22:02,922
It's what he said.

837
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:06,693
But you know, my heart

838
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:07,960
goes out to you.

839
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,829
I know this is tough for you.

840
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,532
I know what you want to do.

841
00:22:17,470 --> 00:22:20,339
[knock at door]

842
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,982
I'm giving him up for adoption.

843
00:22:29,982 --> 00:22:32,952
>> I'm sorry that you're

844
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:35,455
hurting.

845
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:36,889
>> Lori, this decision

846
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:38,958
has to be made.

847
00:22:38,958 --> 00:22:40,026
>> There isn't a decision

848
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:40,893
to be made.

849
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:42,595
I have no choice in this.

850
00:22:42,595 --> 00:22:43,896
Call Jen and Brian tomorrow.

851
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:45,865
I'm not telling them.

852
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,634
>> This isn't the way that

853
00:22:47,634 --> 00:22:49,636
I wanted you to come to this

854
00:22:49,636 --> 00:22:50,537
decision.

855
00:22:50,537 --> 00:22:51,471
>> I mean, you have to admit;

856
00:22:51,471 --> 00:22:53,773
school, life, it's a struggle

857
00:22:53,773 --> 00:22:54,641
for you, Lori.

858
00:22:54,641 --> 00:22:56,643
>> [sniffs]

859
00:22:56,643 --> 00:22:57,510
>> Your mother--

860
00:22:57,510 --> 00:22:58,177
we help you a lot.

861
00:22:58,177 --> 00:22:59,045
Your mom helps you a lot

862
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:00,947
just to get through every week.

863
00:23:00,947 --> 00:23:01,881
>> Cory's done.

864
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,082
He was my last option.

865
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:04,751
There's no miracle that's gonna

866
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:06,453
happen that's gonna change this.

867
00:23:06,453 --> 00:23:07,186
Cory, he doesn't want it

868
00:23:07,186 --> 00:23:08,621
anymore, so you know what?

869
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:10,590
I'm done.

870
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,537
>> Without my parents' or

871
00:23:24,537 --> 00:23:25,304
Cory's help, it looks like

872
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:27,874
open adoption is my only option.

873
00:23:27,874 --> 00:23:29,476
>> Facing reality is a--

874
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:30,677
is tough.

875
00:23:30,677 --> 00:23:31,811
>> Y'all don't know the fact

876
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:33,112
that I'm--I am being forced

877
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:34,647
into this, 'cause I have nowhere

878
00:23:34,647 --> 00:23:35,648
else to turn.

879
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:36,983
Everybody's saying, "Yeah,

880
00:23:36,983 --> 00:23:37,850
your opinion matters.

881
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:38,718
Your opinion matters."

882
00:23:38,718 --> 00:23:39,919
Okay, so I decide against you.

883
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:41,554
Where does that leave me?

884
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:43,590
On the street or something?

885
00:23:43,590 --> 00:23:44,423
>> Well, I think it's the best

886
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:46,659
thing for this baby, but you

887
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:47,960
know, I don't want you to be

888
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,828
emotionally scarred.

889
00:23:48,828 --> 00:23:49,862
>> Well, I'm gonna be.

890
00:23:49,862 --> 00:23:50,997
>> [sighs]

891
00:23:50,997 --> 00:23:51,864
>> Here's the thing you guys

892
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:52,932
don't understand about adoption.

893
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,300
This is the only blood-related

894
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,935
family I have.

895
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:59,606
This is the only person,

896
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:01,207
and now you--everyone's making

897
00:24:01,207 --> 00:24:02,074
me give him to somebody else

898
00:24:02,074 --> 00:24:03,543
to let them raise him.

899
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:04,243
So I want them to just

900
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:05,277
do it now.

901
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,613
This way, I couldn't think

902
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:08,080
about it anymore, 'cause I have

903
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,949
to go on with him inside me

904
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:11,217
knowing as soon as he comes out,

905
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:13,853
he's not mine anymore.

906
00:24:13,853 --> 00:24:15,087
>> He's always going to be

907
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:15,955
yours.

908
00:24:15,955 --> 00:24:17,323
>> I'm never gonna be a mom,

909
00:24:17,323 --> 00:24:18,324
ever.

910
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:19,258
>> You're always going to be

911
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:20,627
his biological mother.

912
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:21,828
>> I was blindsided by this

913
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:23,195
last night.

914
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:24,296
I've been going on for months

915
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:25,164
thinking that I had

916
00:24:25,164 --> 00:24:26,799
another option.

917
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,801
>> Well, I certainly didn't

918
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:30,603
tell him to say that.

919
00:24:30,603 --> 00:24:31,337
>> I didn't say this was

920
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:32,138
your fault.

921
00:24:32,138 --> 00:24:34,340
I'm pissed off at him.

922
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,347
Hearing the news from my parents

923
00:24:41,347 --> 00:24:44,016
last night was devastating.

924
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:45,251
I need to find out why Cory

925
00:24:45,251 --> 00:24:46,819
settled on adoption.

926
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:47,720
Hi.

927
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,122
>> What's up?

928
00:24:50,122 --> 00:24:51,090
>> Congratulations.

929
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:51,958
You made your first

930
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:53,926
parental decision.

931
00:24:53,926 --> 00:24:54,861
>> Gee, thanks.

932
00:24:54,861 --> 00:24:56,362
>> You did, deciding what

933
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:57,229
was best for him.

934
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:58,097
>> Yeah.

935
00:24:58,097 --> 00:24:59,165
And that decision sucks.

936
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:00,266
>> It does suck.

937
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:02,869
I mean, what caused you

938
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:04,303
to change your mind?

939
00:25:04,303 --> 00:25:05,972
>> I did what your dad said.

940
00:25:05,972 --> 00:25:07,974
I did the math,

941
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:09,742
just not financially stable.

942
00:25:09,742 --> 00:25:10,877
Our relationship isn't where

943
00:25:10,877 --> 00:25:13,212
it needs to be to raise a kid.

944
00:25:13,212 --> 00:25:14,346
>> Yeah.

945
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:15,882
How do you think you're gonna

946
00:25:15,882 --> 00:25:17,316
hold up in the delivery room?

947
00:25:17,316 --> 00:25:18,450
>> It's gonna be rough, but

948
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,286
I think I'll make it through it.

949
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:21,187
>> You might have--like, I'm

950
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:23,155
gonna want to not let him go,

951
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:24,090
and I'm not gonna want to do it,

952
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:24,957
but I--

953
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:26,092
>> Yeah, watching a family walk

954
00:25:26,092 --> 00:25:27,459
away with our son is gonna suck.

955
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:28,728
>> It's gonna be extremely hard

956
00:25:28,728 --> 00:25:29,461
to just hand him over.

957
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:31,030
>> Yeah.

958
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,198
>> Talking to Cory helps me

959
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:33,465
understand how hard raising

960
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,134
a baby really would be.

961
00:25:35,134 --> 00:25:36,936
Maybe Jen and Brian will be able

962
00:25:36,936 --> 00:25:41,107
to give my baby a better life.

963
00:25:41,107 --> 00:25:42,341
But just as I was starting

964
00:25:42,341 --> 00:25:43,375
to get comfortable with the idea

965
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,477
of adoption, I got an unexpected

966
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:46,512
phone call from Jen and Brian.

967
00:25:46,512 --> 00:25:47,980
[phone rings]

968
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:50,516
Hello?

969
00:25:50,516 --> 00:25:52,084
What?

970
00:25:52,084 --> 00:25:53,052
They realized they couldn't

971
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,821
prepare for a newborn in the

972
00:25:54,821 --> 00:25:56,956
two weeks before my due date.

973
00:25:56,956 --> 00:25:59,525
The adoption is off.

974
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:01,027
And now I have to break the news

975
00:26:01,027 --> 00:26:02,361
to Cory.

976
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:04,396
Jen called me last night.

977
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,497
>> About what?

978
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:06,999
>> The adoption.

979
00:26:06,999 --> 00:26:09,135
They said her and Brian are both

980
00:26:09,135 --> 00:26:10,402
concerned with going forward

981
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:11,904
with this.

982
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:13,039
>> Like, I put my trust in them,

983
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,374
and they just--they blew that.

984
00:26:15,374 --> 00:26:18,310
>> We may want to look at

985
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,079
other portfolios.

986
00:26:20,079 --> 00:26:21,413
>> It [bleep] sucks.

987
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,281
You know I don't like to meet

988
00:26:22,281 --> 00:26:23,149
new people.

989
00:26:23,149 --> 00:26:24,083
And I'm not going through this

990
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:25,317
for the next month.

991
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:26,285
>> But I mean, we're gonna

992
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:27,954
have to at least try.

993
00:26:27,954 --> 00:26:29,455
You all right?

994
00:26:29,455 --> 00:26:31,157
>> It hurt.

995
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:32,258
>> Cory seems to be

996
00:26:32,258 --> 00:26:33,492
reconsidering.

997
00:26:33,492 --> 00:26:34,927
But with only a few weeks

998
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,428
to go, I have to look into

999
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:38,330
another adoptive couple.

1000
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:40,432
So my parents decided it was

1001
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,968
time to meet with an adoption

1002
00:26:41,968 --> 00:26:42,969
social worker to get this

1003
00:26:42,969 --> 00:26:44,136
process moving.

1004
00:26:44,136 --> 00:26:46,072
>> So what do y'all think

1005
00:26:46,072 --> 00:26:47,039
about an open adoption?

1006
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:48,107
How do you picture the

1007
00:26:48,107 --> 00:26:49,175
relationship being in the next

1008
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:50,943
two or three months?

1009
00:26:50,943 --> 00:26:52,178
>> I'd like to see him, like,

1010
00:26:52,178 --> 00:26:53,212
around the holidays, like,

1011
00:26:53,212 --> 00:26:54,480
around, like, birthdays

1012
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,381
and everything and...

1013
00:26:55,381 --> 00:26:56,448
>> So do you picture going to

1014
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,950
their house to visit with them?

1015
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:58,718
>> If, like, they go out,

1016
00:26:58,718 --> 00:26:59,485
like, maybe, like, once in

1017
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:00,352
a while, like, I could, like,

1018
00:27:00,352 --> 00:27:01,220
be their babysitter or

1019
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:02,088
something, just see him

1020
00:27:02,088 --> 00:27:02,989
every once in a while.

1021
00:27:02,989 --> 00:27:03,990
>> Okay, I want to tell you

1022
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:04,791
that what you're describing

1023
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:06,726
is very unusual, okay?

1024
00:27:06,726 --> 00:27:07,593
>> Okay.

1025
00:27:07,593 --> 00:27:08,460
>> I'm not saying it won't

1026
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,996
happen, but it'll be a very

1027
00:27:09,996 --> 00:27:11,563
unusual family that will agree

1028
00:27:11,563 --> 00:27:12,464
to that.

1029
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,332
>> Yeah.

1030
00:27:13,332 --> 00:27:15,634
>> If they do, that's great,

1031
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,203
but the thing you need to find

1032
00:27:17,203 --> 00:27:19,605
out now, is there a willingness

1033
00:27:19,605 --> 00:27:21,473
for a relationship to build?

1034
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,608
What do you want it to be like

1035
00:27:22,608 --> 00:27:24,143
at the hospital?

1036
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:25,644
>> I don't want them to be there

1037
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,613
the day of, just 'cause I want,

1038
00:27:27,613 --> 00:27:29,615
like, my time with him

1039
00:27:29,615 --> 00:27:30,482
and everything.

1040
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,450
>> That makes sense.

1041
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:32,484
You've got to say hello

1042
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:33,720
before you can say good-bye.

1043
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,586
>> Yeah.

1044
00:27:34,586 --> 00:27:35,454
>> Mm-hmm.

1045
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:36,422
>> Yeah.

1046
00:27:36,422 --> 00:27:38,057
Cory came over later to look

1047
00:27:38,057 --> 00:27:39,458
at some portfolios of new

1048
00:27:39,458 --> 00:27:41,227
adoptive couples.

1049
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:43,162
We need to focus and make

1050
00:27:43,162 --> 00:27:44,496
our choice together.

1051
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:48,234
Here's this one.

1052
00:27:48,234 --> 00:27:51,470
What do you think about them?

1053
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,338
>> I don't know.

1054
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:53,239
People are different in person

1055
00:27:53,239 --> 00:27:54,473
than on paper.

1056
00:27:54,473 --> 00:27:55,842
>> That is the only portfolio

1057
00:27:55,842 --> 00:27:57,143
that actually stood out.

1058
00:27:57,143 --> 00:27:59,846
Their dog is really cute.

1059
00:27:59,846 --> 00:28:00,713
They can still, like,

1060
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:02,681
run around and--

1061
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:03,582
>> Everybody is waiting on me

1062
00:28:03,582 --> 00:28:08,821
at the bar.

1063
00:28:08,821 --> 00:28:09,722
I don't know.

1064
00:28:09,722 --> 00:28:10,656
I'm not gonna meet 'em yet.

1065
00:28:10,656 --> 00:28:11,590
'Cause now I have that whole--

1066
00:28:11,590 --> 00:28:12,491
>> You're gonna have to meet

1067
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:13,359
them very soon.

1068
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,393
>> Well, they're gonna have to

1069
00:28:14,393 --> 00:28:15,594
work around my work schedule.

1070
00:28:15,594 --> 00:28:20,599
[phone buzzing]

1071
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:21,567
All right, I'm only gonna be

1072
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:22,735
a few more minutes.

1073
00:28:22,735 --> 00:28:24,503
Later.

1074
00:28:24,503 --> 00:28:26,739
>> Here's this one.

1075
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:27,706
>> Are they up for open

1076
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,574
adoption?

1077
00:28:28,574 --> 00:28:29,441
>> What do you want in

1078
00:28:29,441 --> 00:28:30,476
an open adoption?

1079
00:28:30,476 --> 00:28:31,610
>> Be able to see him.

1080
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:32,478
>> I know, but--

1081
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:33,345
>> Be part of his life.

1082
00:28:33,345 --> 00:28:34,213
>> Like, how often do

1083
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:35,281
you expect--

1084
00:28:35,281 --> 00:28:36,382
>> Two weekends out of the month

1085
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:37,383
would be great.

1086
00:28:37,383 --> 00:28:38,717
>> Two weekends?

1087
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:41,187
>> I don't even know anymore.

1088
00:28:41,187 --> 00:28:41,954
>> Did something make you

1089
00:28:41,954 --> 00:28:42,822
change?

1090
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:43,790
>> Yeah, the whole

1091
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:45,391
Brian-Jen situation.

1092
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,659
>> But you're still set on this.

1093
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:51,964
>> No.

1094
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:54,333
I got some thinking to do.

1095
00:28:54,333 --> 00:28:56,235
>> You have to be on board.

1096
00:28:56,235 --> 00:29:01,240
[phone buzzes]

1097
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,442
>> Not today.

1098
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:04,476
I'm not gonna be in any shape

1099
00:29:04,476 --> 00:29:06,412
to talk to anybody later.

1100
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,792
>> [mumbles]

1101
00:29:19,792 --> 00:29:21,627
[sobs]

1102
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:24,763
>> What's the matter?

1103
00:29:34,606 --> 00:29:36,542
>> What's up?

1104
00:29:42,982 --> 00:29:45,084
>> Cory's not being supportive.

1105
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:46,318
Time is running out.

1106
00:29:46,318 --> 00:29:47,653
He's making choosing adoption

1107
00:29:47,653 --> 00:29:49,588
even harder than it needs to be.

1108
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:55,727
>> Since Cory is making this

1109
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,329
so difficult, my parents and I

1110
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:58,597
are moving forward and meeting

1111
00:29:58,597 --> 00:29:59,665
a new adoptive couple.

1112
00:29:59,665 --> 00:30:00,799
>> Hey.

1113
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:01,667
>> Hi.

1114
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:02,568
>> Hi.

1115
00:30:02,568 --> 00:30:03,469
>> How are you?

1116
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:04,937
>> Good, how are you?

1117
00:30:04,937 --> 00:30:06,605
I hope this couple turns out

1118
00:30:06,605 --> 00:30:08,007
better than Jen and Brian.

1119
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:09,441
>> What kind of adoption

1120
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:10,742
were you looking into?

1121
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:12,511
>> Open adoption.

1122
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:14,046
We feel, as potential parents,

1123
00:30:14,046 --> 00:30:15,147
we would be doing an injustice

1124
00:30:15,147 --> 00:30:16,849
to our child if we told them,

1125
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:17,816
you know, "We don't know a thing

1126
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:18,717
about you," you know?

1127
00:30:18,717 --> 00:30:19,585
Or about your mom,

1128
00:30:19,585 --> 00:30:20,486
know nothing about your dad

1129
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:21,587
and trying to close a door on

1130
00:30:21,587 --> 00:30:22,454
it, and that's just not

1131
00:30:22,454 --> 00:30:23,155
what we want.

1132
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,056
>> Yeah.

1133
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:24,924
>> Yeah.

1134
00:30:24,924 --> 00:30:26,792
>> This will be your child.

1135
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:29,628
And whatever you will allow us

1136
00:30:29,628 --> 00:30:31,663
to do in terms of contact,

1137
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:32,965
we will--we would greatly

1138
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:34,033
appreciate it.

1139
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:35,434
>> I wouldn't expect, like,

1140
00:30:35,434 --> 00:30:37,136
every single week, by any means.

1141
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:38,804
Like, even if it was just,

1142
00:30:38,804 --> 00:30:39,705
like, pictures.

1143
00:30:39,705 --> 00:30:40,572
>> Yeah.

1144
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:41,473
>> Just to see him grow up

1145
00:30:41,473 --> 00:30:42,141
and everything.

1146
00:30:42,141 --> 00:30:43,075
>> We understand that.

1147
00:30:43,075 --> 00:30:43,943
You need to feel comfortable

1148
00:30:43,943 --> 00:30:45,444
for the rest of your life

1149
00:30:45,444 --> 00:30:46,512
knowing you made a perfect

1150
00:30:46,512 --> 00:30:47,213
decision.

1151
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:48,080
>> Yeah.

1152
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,448
>> You know, I mean, we totally,

1153
00:30:49,448 --> 00:30:50,582
completely understand that.

1154
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:51,450
>> Like, yeah.

1155
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:52,484
>> And we appreciate that.

1156
00:30:52,484 --> 00:30:53,886
>> That's good, yeah.

1157
00:30:53,886 --> 00:30:54,820
I really like these guys.

1158
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,988
I think they'd make great

1159
00:30:55,988 --> 00:30:57,990
parents, and Cory might even

1160
00:30:57,990 --> 00:30:59,525
like them too.

1161
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:00,927
We talked about baby names

1162
00:31:00,927 --> 00:31:03,495
and agreed on Aidan.

1163
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:04,630
Thank you so much.

1164
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:05,731
They even want to have a special

1165
00:31:05,731 --> 00:31:06,865
adoption ceremony to mark

1166
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:10,970
the occasion.

1167
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:12,104
Now that I've found the adoptive

1168
00:31:12,104 --> 00:31:13,906
parents, I feel better about

1169
00:31:13,906 --> 00:31:14,873
this decision.

1170
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:15,841
I love them.

1171
00:31:15,841 --> 00:31:16,742
I couldn't have found, like,

1172
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:17,709
a better family.

1173
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:18,710
They're awesome.

1174
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,845
>> That's good.

1175
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:22,514
What does Cory think about it?

1176
00:31:22,514 --> 00:31:23,515
>> I don't think he's gonna

1177
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:24,550
take it very well.

1178
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:25,817
It's hit him hard, the fact

1179
00:31:25,817 --> 00:31:27,053
that he can't keep him.

1180
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:28,887
>> And I have a feeling that

1181
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,122
something's gonna happen with

1182
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:31,090
Cory, and it's not gonna

1183
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,624
be good.

1184
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,160
>> Cory hasn't fully accepted

1185
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,827
my decision to move forward

1186
00:31:35,827 --> 00:31:37,263
with the new adoptive parents.

1187
00:31:37,263 --> 00:31:38,797
But I don't have any more time

1188
00:31:38,797 --> 00:31:39,865
to try and convince him.

1189
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:40,832
>> You know you're officially

1190
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:43,769
term now, which means that you

1191
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:44,836
could go into labor any time.

1192
00:31:44,836 --> 00:31:45,704
>> Yeah.

1193
00:31:45,704 --> 00:31:47,940
>> So I want us to have a plan.

1194
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:48,807
>> Mm-hmm.

1195
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:50,142
>> Now, do you want the baby

1196
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:51,143
to stay with us in the room

1197
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:52,011
while...

1198
00:31:52,011 --> 00:31:52,878
>> Mm-hmm.

1199
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:53,946
>> Okay.

1200
00:31:53,946 --> 00:31:55,114
>> Stay in the room.

1201
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:56,015
>> For your whole

1202
00:31:56,015 --> 00:31:56,915
hospitalization?

1203
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:57,984
Have you thought about that?

1204
00:31:57,984 --> 00:31:58,850
>> Mm-mm.

1205
00:31:58,850 --> 00:32:00,119
>> Personally, that sounds

1206
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:02,221
really painful to me.

1207
00:32:02,221 --> 00:32:03,922
>> In terms of physically,

1208
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:04,957
after just delivering or just--

1209
00:32:04,957 --> 00:32:05,857
>> No, I'm thinking of

1210
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:06,725
emotionally.

1211
00:32:06,725 --> 00:32:08,194
>> Emotionally.

1212
00:32:08,194 --> 00:32:09,228
>> It's just such an intense

1213
00:32:09,228 --> 00:32:11,230
time, and I think if you're

1214
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,399
thinking about placing the baby,

1215
00:32:13,399 --> 00:32:15,067
that's gonna be pretty hard.

1216
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:17,703
>> Mm-hmm.

1217
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:18,637
[groans]

1218
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:19,838
After nine months of being

1219
00:32:19,838 --> 00:32:21,040
pregnant, I can't believe

1220
00:32:21,040 --> 00:32:22,641
my due date is here.

1221
00:32:22,641 --> 00:32:25,811
But the baby isn't ready yet.

1222
00:32:25,811 --> 00:32:29,115
So I wait and wait and wait

1223
00:32:29,115 --> 00:32:32,718
for my contractions to start.

1224
00:32:32,718 --> 00:32:33,419
>> Yeah.

1225
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:34,820
Since I was four days past

1226
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:36,922
my due date, Dr. Kessler called

1227
00:32:36,922 --> 00:32:37,789
and suggested I be induced

1228
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,158
at the hospital.

1229
00:32:39,158 --> 00:32:40,792
I texted Cory at work and told

1230
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:41,460
him it was time.

1231
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,361
>> Come on.

1232
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:45,031
Let's go.

1233
00:32:45,031 --> 00:32:46,965
>> I'm really getting nervous.

1234
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:50,069
I know this is gonna be tough.

1235
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:51,337
>> Give me your arm.

1236
00:32:51,337 --> 00:32:53,472
>> Okay.

1237
00:32:53,472 --> 00:32:55,007
>> Are you feeling anything now,

1238
00:32:55,007 --> 00:32:56,808
Lori?

1239
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,110
You're contracting.

1240
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,011
>> I am?

1241
00:32:59,011 --> 00:33:00,779
>> Right now, yeah.

1242
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:01,847
>> Wow.

1243
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:03,215
>> All right.

1244
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:04,916
>> Even though Cory is still

1245
00:33:04,916 --> 00:33:06,252
on the fence, he wants to be

1246
00:33:06,252 --> 00:33:07,753
here, and I think he should.

1247
00:33:07,753 --> 00:33:08,420
Hi.

1248
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:09,321
>> Welcome.

1249
00:33:09,321 --> 00:33:10,222
>> My mom was less than

1250
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:12,224
thrilled.

1251
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:14,460
[monitor beeping]

1252
00:33:16,962 --> 00:33:17,829
>> That's just--

1253
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:18,930
she's made a big change.

1254
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,966
She's, like, 7 to 8.

1255
00:33:20,966 --> 00:33:23,135
>> Finally, it was time to push.

1256
00:33:23,135 --> 00:33:25,003
I decided to get an epidural

1257
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,238
to avoid the real pain.

1258
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:27,339
>> What I'm going to do is,

1259
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:28,440
I'm going to have you pull up

1260
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,308
on me.

1261
00:33:29,308 --> 00:33:30,209
Okay, there you go.

1262
00:33:30,209 --> 00:33:31,243
That's better.

1263
00:33:31,243 --> 00:33:32,111
>> I want you to push

1264
00:33:32,111 --> 00:33:33,079
through your fear.

1265
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:34,813
Okay, it's time.

1266
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:37,283
You can do it.

1267
00:33:37,283 --> 00:33:38,550
Okay, now take a deep breath

1268
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:39,918
and push.

1269
00:33:39,918 --> 00:33:40,886
Push like you're trying to poop.

1270
00:33:40,886 --> 00:33:42,054
Push as hard as you can.

1271
00:33:42,054 --> 00:33:42,954
Go, go, girl.

1272
00:33:42,954 --> 00:33:43,889
Now take a deep breath.

1273
00:33:43,889 --> 00:33:44,656
Come back and do it again.

1274
00:33:44,656 --> 00:33:46,925
Push, push hard, push hard.

1275
00:33:46,925 --> 00:33:47,593
Go, go.

1276
00:33:47,593 --> 00:33:48,460
Go, go.

1277
00:33:48,460 --> 00:33:49,328
Everything you got.

1278
00:33:49,328 --> 00:33:50,196
>> Five, six.

1279
00:33:50,196 --> 00:33:51,097
>> Go, go.

1280
00:33:51,097 --> 00:33:53,899
>> Seven, eight, nine, ten.

1281
00:33:53,899 --> 00:33:55,201
And again, one more time.

1282
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:56,435
And push.

1283
00:33:56,435 --> 00:33:57,303
>> Push hard, honey.

1284
00:33:57,303 --> 00:33:58,170
Push hard.

1285
00:33:58,170 --> 00:33:59,138
Come on, that's it.

1286
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:00,005
Nice job.

1287
00:34:00,005 --> 00:34:00,872
You are in the right place.

1288
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:01,540
Go, go, girl.

1289
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,408
>> Seven, eight.

1290
00:34:02,408 --> 00:34:03,275
>> Nice, that's it.

1291
00:34:03,275 --> 00:34:04,143
That's it.

1292
00:34:04,143 --> 00:34:05,077
You're in the right place.

1293
00:34:05,077 --> 00:34:06,011
That's it, Lori, right there.

1294
00:34:06,011 --> 00:34:06,945
>> And ah.

1295
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:07,913
>> Push, push, push.

1296
00:34:07,913 --> 00:34:08,647
>> One.

1297
00:34:08,647 --> 00:34:09,548
>> Think how much you want this

1298
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:10,416
to be over.

1299
00:34:10,416 --> 00:34:11,283
>> Eight.

1300
00:34:11,283 --> 00:34:12,151
>> Nice one.

1301
00:34:12,151 --> 00:34:13,018
>> You got it. You got it.

1302
00:34:13,018 --> 00:34:13,919
>> Seven.

1303
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:14,586
>> Come on.

1304
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:15,454
You get him out of there.

1305
00:34:15,454 --> 00:34:16,322
You think how much you want

1306
00:34:16,322 --> 00:34:17,189
to be done with this.

1307
00:34:17,189 --> 00:34:18,056
Make it a good one.

1308
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:18,924
>> Come on, Lori.

1309
00:34:18,924 --> 00:34:19,591
Baby's right there.

1310
00:34:19,591 --> 00:34:20,459
>> Six.

1311
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:21,327
>> Go-go-go-go-go-go.

1312
00:34:21,327 --> 00:34:22,194
That's it. That's it.

1313
00:34:22,194 --> 00:34:23,061
That's it. That's it.

1314
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:23,962
You're in the right place.

1315
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:25,264
>> Yeah, yeah, yeah, this is it.

1316
00:34:25,264 --> 00:34:26,365
>> Hi.

1317
00:34:26,365 --> 00:34:28,400
>> It's nice to look at you.

1318
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,335
Mommy needs to see you

1319
00:34:29,335 --> 00:34:30,202
right now.

1320
00:34:30,202 --> 00:34:31,370
>> Oh, yeah.

1321
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:32,704
>> Aw.

1322
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:34,573

1328

>> You want to take pictures

1329

of him once?

1330
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,714

>> I'm good.

1337
00:35:46,178 --> 00:35:47,613
>> The reality of this adoption

1338
00:35:47,613 --> 00:35:52,351
is hitting Cory hard.

My family doesn't want me

1342

to give him up.

1343
00:35:57,623 --> 00:35:59,225
My grandpa straight up told me

1344
00:35:59,225 --> 00:36:00,792
he's disappointed in our choice.

1345
00:36:00,792 --> 00:36:02,561

1346
00:36:02,561 --> 00:36:03,429
but I don't.

Quit.

Just relax.

Just relax.

You're fine.

You're gonna be fine tonight.

these two days have flown by.

It's already time for

the adoption ceremony.

1400
00:37:39,358 --> 00:37:40,792
I'm nervous, but I have to stay

00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:43,395
true to my decision.

00:37:45,464 --> 00:37:49,635
* Is it true *

We're here to celebrate

that in an open adoption,

1429
00:38:37,916 --> 00:38:38,850
saying good-bye is only

1430
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:42,187
temporary.

00:38:49,595 --> 00:38:50,929
This pregnancy, by far,

1433
00:38:50,929 --> 00:38:52,230
has been the hardest thing

1434
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,832
I have gone through.

1435
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,934
>> You all right?

1436
00:38:55,934 --> 00:38:58,036
>> I do wish my parents

1437
00:38:58,036 --> 00:38:59,871
would not have tried to push

1438
00:38:59,871 --> 00:39:02,040
the adoption so hard.

1439
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:06,011

1440
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:08,013
but you know, all those fears

1441

are gone.

00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,248
>> Yeah.

1443
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:13,184
I wish I would have taken it

1444
00:39:13,184 --> 00:39:14,653
more seriously from the

1445
00:39:14,653 --> 00:39:16,254
beginning, not waiting till

1446
00:39:16,254 --> 00:39:17,856
I was four or five months along

1447
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,125
to stop and think about what

1448
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:21,760
I was gonna do and how I was

1449
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:23,695
gonna do it.

1450
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,063
After the pregnancy, it feels

1451
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:26,598
like a fresh start.

1457

>> Cory and I have been through

1458
00:39:38,777 --> 00:39:39,645
a lot.

1459
00:39:39,645 --> 00:39:41,179
We were both on different pages

1460
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:42,814
throughout the whole thing,

1461
00:39:42,814 --> 00:39:45,216
and it's a lot harder for him

1462
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:46,885
to come to terms with it

1463
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:48,820
than it was for me.

1464
00:39:48,820 --> 00:39:49,888
So how have you been?

1465
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:52,090
I've been a little concerned.

1466
00:39:52,090 --> 00:39:53,024
>> I don't know.

1467
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:53,959
I guess in the beginning,

1468
00:39:53,959 --> 00:39:54,893
it was really hard.

1469
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:55,927
I mean, I got too attached

1470
00:39:55,927 --> 00:39:56,828
at the hospital,

1471
00:39:56,828 --> 00:39:58,063
and I know I shouldn't have.

1472
00:39:58,063 --> 00:39:59,865
>> I know, but we will always

1473
00:39:59,865 --> 00:40:00,799
be a part of his life, always,

1474
00:40:00,799 --> 00:40:01,967
till the day one of us--

1475
00:40:01,967 --> 00:40:03,168
both of us die.

1476
00:40:03,168 --> 00:40:05,103
Like, when I see you in him--

1477
00:40:05,103 --> 00:40:06,137
I'll show you a picture.

1478
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:10,408
Like, now he looks like you.

1479
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,812
I do know that we both agree

1480
00:40:13,812 --> 00:40:15,113
on one thing, and that's that

1481
00:40:15,113 --> 00:40:16,815
this was the best thing for

1482
00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:19,250
Aidan, and I think that will

1483
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:22,020
always kind of hold us together.

1484
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,723
I don't understand why

1485
00:40:24,723 --> 00:40:27,225
my birth mother chose adoption.

1486
00:40:27,225 --> 00:40:28,894
I have never had her here

1487
00:40:28,894 --> 00:40:30,762
to explain to me her reasons.

1488
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:34,199
She must have felt like she

1489
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:36,101
couldn't do it.

1490
00:40:36,101 --> 00:40:37,836
I absolutely know what that

1491
00:40:37,836 --> 00:40:39,437
feels like firsthand now.

1492
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:41,473
I wanted to parent more than

1493
00:40:41,473 --> 00:40:43,174
anything, and I still do,

1494
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:46,878
and one day, I will be a mom.

1495
00:40:46,878 --> 00:40:50,281
And that is for sure.

1496
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,065
>> What are you scared of?

1497
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:09,334
>> Everything.

1498
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:10,802
>> What size is that?

1499
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:11,837
>> Size 13.

1500
00:41:11,837 --> 00:41:13,371
>> Wow.

1501
00:41:13,371 --> 00:41:14,339
Going behind her back,

1502
00:41:14,339 --> 00:41:15,440
picking her up,

1503
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:16,307
just so that they can have

1504
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:17,475
contact to see each other.

1505
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,409
I just don't think that that was

1506
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,411
a responsible move as a parent.

1507
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:21,547
>> I really love you.

1508
00:41:21,547 --> 00:41:22,548
