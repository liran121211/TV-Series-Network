>> MY NAME IS EBONY, AND I'M

2
00:00:06,144 --> 00:00:07,490
A TEENAGE MILITARY BRAT

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:09,630
FROM COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO,

4
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:12,288
HOME OF THE AIR FORCE.

5
00:00:12,288 --> 00:00:13,875
I'M A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL,

6
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:15,118
AND I SPEND ALL MY TIME

7
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:16,740
WITH MY FIANCE, JOSH.

8
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:17,638
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER

9
00:00:17,638 --> 00:00:18,742
JUST OVER A YEAR.

10
00:00:18,742 --> 00:00:19,674
DID I TELL YOU NOT TO EAT

11
00:00:19,674 --> 00:00:20,434
MY OREOS?

12
00:00:20,434 --> 00:00:22,125
I LIVE AT HOME WITH MY MOM.

13
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,644
SHE WORKS A LOT, SO I'VE LEARNED

14
00:00:23,644 --> 00:00:24,955
TO TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

15
00:00:24,955 --> 00:00:26,440
JOSH LIVES WITH HIS PARENTS,

16
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:28,442
AND HIS MOM IS A LITTLE MORE

17
00:00:28,442 --> 00:00:29,098
HANDS-ON.

18
00:00:29,098 --> 00:00:29,822
>> YOU WEREN'T AT SCHOOL.

19
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:30,478
YOU NEVER WENT TO SCHOOL

20
00:00:30,478 --> 00:00:31,134
THAT DAY.

21
00:00:31,134 --> 00:00:32,032
>> YEAH, AND I'VE ONLY MISSED,

22
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:33,999
MAYBE, AT TOPS, 50 CLASSES

23
00:00:33,999 --> 00:00:34,931
THIS SEMESTER.

24
00:00:34,931 --> 00:00:36,381
>> SO WE CAN'T WAIT TO GRADUATE

25
00:00:36,381 --> 00:00:38,383
HIGH SCHOOL AND ESCAPE.

26
00:00:38,383 --> 00:00:39,625
WE BOTH COME FROM MILITARY

27
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,041
FAMILIES, AND WE ALWAYS WANTED

28
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,801
TO FOLLOW IN THEIR FOOTSTEPS,

29
00:00:42,801 --> 00:00:44,803
SO WE JOINED JUNIOR ROTC

30
00:00:44,803 --> 00:00:45,459
AT OUR HIGH SCHOOL.

31
00:00:45,459 --> 00:00:47,081
AW, YOU LOOK GOOD.

32
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:48,841
AFTER GRADUATION, WE'RE PLANNING

33
00:00:48,841 --> 00:00:49,877
TO GET MARRIED,

34
00:00:49,877 --> 00:00:50,947
JOIN THE AIR FORCE,

35
00:00:50,947 --> 00:00:52,914
AND FLY AWAY TOGETHER.

36
00:00:52,914 --> 00:00:54,399
BUT NOW ALL OF OUR PLANS ARE

37
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:57,057
UP IN THE AIR, BECAUSE...

38
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,059
UP IN THE AIR, BECAUSE...
I'M PREGNANT.

39
00:00:59,059 --> 00:00:59,576
I'M PREGNANT.

MY MOM WAS PRETTY BUMMED

44
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:12,141
WHEN SHE FOUND OUT.

45
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:13,003
>> YEAH, BUT, YOU KNOW, I WAS A

46
00:01:13,003 --> 00:01:14,695
LITTLE UPSET ABOUT NOT--YOU

47
00:01:14,695 --> 00:01:16,835
KNOW, THE PROTECTION THING, AND

48
00:01:16,835 --> 00:01:19,113
WE TALKED ABOUT CONDOMS AND...

49
00:01:19,113 --> 00:01:19,872
>> MM-HMM.

50
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:21,081
>> IN FACT, I SAT YOU AND JOSH

51
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:23,359
DOWN RIGHT HERE AND SAID, "HEY,

52
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:24,532
USE PROTECTION.

53
00:01:24,532 --> 00:01:25,188
I DON'T WANT TO BE

54
00:01:25,188 --> 00:01:26,086
A GRANDMA YET."

55
00:01:26,086 --> 00:01:27,501
AND LOOK, NOW I'M GONNA BE

56
00:01:27,501 --> 00:01:28,467
A GRANDMA.

57
00:01:28,467 --> 00:01:30,297
>> I THINK JOSH'S PARENTS WERE

58
00:01:30,297 --> 00:01:31,263
A LITTLE BIT MORE UPSET ABOUT

59
00:01:31,263 --> 00:01:32,575
IT, BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T LET US

60
00:01:32,575 --> 00:01:33,921
STAY IN THE SAME ROOM, EVEN

61
00:01:33,921 --> 00:01:35,819
AFTER I WAS PREGNANT.

62
00:01:35,819 --> 00:01:36,475
>> REALLY?

63
00:01:36,475 --> 00:01:37,269
SO HOW DO THEY YOU THINK

64
00:01:37,269 --> 00:01:39,340
YOU GOT PREGNANT?

65
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,101
IMMACULATE CONCEPTION?

66
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,448
>> [laughs]

67
00:01:43,448 --> 00:01:45,277
>> SO HOW OLD WERE YOU THE FIRST

68
00:01:45,277 --> 00:01:46,485
TIME WE STARTED TALKING ABOUT

69
00:01:46,485 --> 00:01:48,142
SEX WITH YOU?

70
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:49,799
SERIOUSLY, JOSHUA.

71
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:50,765
YOU REMEMBER I HAD TO SIGN THOSE

72
00:01:50,765 --> 00:01:52,215
PAPERS FOR THAT CLASS, AND YOU

73
00:01:52,215 --> 00:01:53,320
CAME HOME AND EXPLAINED TO ME

74
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:54,424
HOW A BABY'S MADE?

75
00:01:54,424 --> 00:01:56,116
>> YEAH, THE SEX ED CLASSES.

76
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,772
>> YOU MADE SURE THAT YOU KNEW

77
00:01:57,772 --> 00:01:59,464
WHAT PRECAUTIONS TO TAKE AND

78
00:01:59,464 --> 00:02:00,810
THAT YOU HAD THOSE PRECAUTIONS.

79
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:03,295
>> AND WE USED THEM.

80
00:02:03,295 --> 00:02:04,331
[laughs]

81
00:02:04,331 --> 00:02:05,746
>> THEN WHY ARE YOU GOING TO BE

82
00:02:05,746 --> 00:02:06,954
A DADDY?

83
00:02:06,954 --> 00:02:08,749
>> 'CAUSE--I DON'T KNOW.

84
00:02:08,749 --> 00:02:10,475
>> IS HE UP TO THIS?

85
00:02:10,475 --> 00:02:12,028
I MEAN...

86
00:02:12,028 --> 00:02:13,961
>> I THINK HE'LL GROW UP AS SOON

87
00:02:13,961 --> 00:02:15,963
AS HE HOLDS HER, BECAUSE YOU

88
00:02:15,963 --> 00:02:18,690
KNOW HOW FATHERS AREN'T REALLY

89
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,863
FATHERS UNTIL THEY HOLD

90
00:02:19,863 --> 00:02:20,761
THEIR BABY.

91
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:22,763
THEIR BABY.
>> MAYBE.

92
00:02:22,763 --> 00:02:29,425
>> MAYBE.

EXCITED ABOUT MY PREGNANCY,

108
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,104
BUT OTHER KIDS JUST AREN'T

109

AS COOL WITH IT.

>> MY SISTER HAD HER KID BECAUSE

111
00:02:57,694 --> 00:02:58,833
THEY DIDN'T USE A CONDOM.

112

I MEAN, I SAW HOW

113
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:00,801
IT RUINED HER LIFE.

114
00:03:00,801 --> 00:03:01,974
I DON'T WANNA END UP LIKE THAT.

HAPPEN FOR A REASON, AND I'M

118
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:09,775
HAVING MY BABY BECAUSE I WANT

119
00:03:09,775 --> 00:03:10,707

00:04:43,731 --> 00:04:45,146
THE BABY IS DUE IN MAY.

192
00:04:45,146 --> 00:04:45,940
>> SHOULD CALL UP THE PEOPLE

193
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,769
WHO MAKE BLIMPS.

194
00:04:46,769 --> 00:04:48,322
>> I'M GONNA BE, LIKE, THIS BIG.

195
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:49,392
I'LL BE THIS BIG.

196
00:04:49,392 --> 00:04:51,187
YOU SEE THIS TABLE RIGHT HERE?

197
00:04:51,187 --> 00:04:53,396
THIS IS HOW BIG I'M GONNA BE.

198
00:04:53,396 --> 00:04:54,466
>> YOU KNOW WHAT MY MOM SAID

199
00:04:54,466 --> 00:04:55,260
ABOUT YOU?

200
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,262
SHE'S LIKE--NO OFFENSE, JOSH,

201
00:04:57,262 --> 00:04:58,746
BUT SHE'S LIKE, "EBONY IS SO

202
00:04:58,746 --> 00:04:59,506
BEAUTIFUL."

203
00:04:59,506 --> 00:05:00,472
AND SHE'S LIKE, "THEN YOU HAVE

204
00:05:00,472 --> 00:05:01,818
JOSH, AND HE'S JUST KIND OF

205
00:05:01,818 --> 00:05:02,681
GOOFY-LOOKING."

206
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:03,717
I WAS LIKE, "MOM!"

207
00:05:03,717 --> 00:05:06,754
[laughter]

208
00:05:06,754 --> 00:05:07,583
'CAUSE YOU HAVE TO FACE IT,

209
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:08,273
JOSH.

210
00:05:08,273 --> 00:05:09,619
YOU'RE KIND OF GOOFY-LOOKING.

211
00:05:09,619 --> 00:05:12,242
>> [indistinct chatter]

212
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:13,105
>> AM I REALLY THAT

213
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:13,761
PATHETIC-LOOKING?

214
00:05:13,761 --> 00:05:14,900
LIKE, IS IT SO HARD TO BELIEVE

215
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,591
THAT I'M WITH HER?

216
00:05:15,591 --> 00:05:17,731
>> NO, HONESTLY I CAN'T PICTURE

217
00:05:17,731 --> 00:05:19,733
>> NO, HONESTLY I CAN'T PICTURE
EBONY WITH ANYBODY ELSE.

218
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:28,431
EBONY WITH ANYBODY ELSE.

219
00:05:28,431 --> 00:05:29,846
>> HEY, JOSH, ARE YOU GOING TO

220
00:05:29,846 --> 00:05:30,882
SPEND THE NIGHT THIS EVENING,

221
00:05:30,882 --> 00:05:32,401
OR ARE YOU ALLOWED?

222
00:05:32,401 --> 00:05:33,263
>> I CAN ASK, THOUGH.

223
00:05:33,263 --> 00:05:34,403
I CAN CALL MY MOM REAL QUICK

224
00:05:34,403 --> 00:05:35,127
AND SEE.

225
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:36,957
BUT I GOT A QUESTION TO--

226
00:05:36,957 --> 00:05:38,407
I WANTED TO KNOW IF I COULD

227
00:05:38,407 --> 00:05:40,409
I WANTED TO KNOW IF I COULD
STAY THE NIGHT TONIGHT.

228
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:45,655
STAY THE NIGHT TONIGHT.

229
00:05:45,655 --> 00:05:47,657
STAY THE NIGHT TONIGHT.
>> HI, CHRISTI.

230
00:05:47,657 --> 00:05:49,694
>> HI, CHRISTI.

231
00:05:49,694 --> 00:05:51,696
>> HI, CHRISTI.
YEAH, HE'S HERE.

232
00:05:51,696 --> 00:05:53,905
YEAH, HE'S HERE.

233
00:05:53,905 --> 00:05:54,561
[chime dings]

234
00:05:54,561 --> 00:05:55,769
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE MY BABY'S

235
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:57,357
DADDY CAN'T STAY OVER WITHOUT

236
00:05:57,357 --> 00:05:58,875
ASKING HIS MOMMY.

237
00:05:58,875 --> 00:05:59,738
>> SO WHERE DO YOU WANT ME TO

238
00:05:59,738 --> 00:06:00,946
TRY TO GET STATIONED?

239
00:06:00,946 --> 00:06:01,878
>> HAWAII.

240
00:06:01,878 --> 00:06:02,672
>> HAWAII?

241
00:06:02,672 --> 00:06:03,432
>> HAWAII.

242
00:06:03,432 --> 00:06:04,812
DO YOU REMEMBER THE FIRST TIME

243
00:06:04,812 --> 00:06:06,780
THAT YOU ASKED ME TO MARRY YOU?

244
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,781
DO YOU REMEMBER?

245
00:06:07,781 --> 00:06:10,093
>> A WHILE AGO.

246
00:06:10,093 --> 00:06:11,543
>> SO WERE YOU NOT SERIOUS

247
00:06:11,543 --> 00:06:12,337
ABOUT IT THEN?

248
00:06:12,337 --> 00:06:14,201
>> NO, I WAS SERIOUS.

249
00:06:14,201 --> 00:06:16,272
WE'RE ALREADY 17 AND HAVING

250
00:06:16,272 --> 00:06:16,928
A KID.

251
00:06:16,928 --> 00:06:18,792
THAT'S ALREADY A BIG STEP

252
00:06:18,792 --> 00:06:19,655
RIGHT THERE.

253
00:06:19,655 --> 00:06:20,656
I'M NOT TRYING TO BE 17

254
00:06:20,656 --> 00:06:21,519
AND MARRIED.

255
00:06:21,519 --> 00:06:24,073
>> OKAY, THAT'S FINE.

256
00:06:24,073 --> 00:06:28,008
THAT'S FINE WITH ME.

257
00:06:28,008 --> 00:06:29,492
WITH JOSH SECOND-GUESSING OUR

258
00:06:29,492 --> 00:06:30,907
MARRIAGE PLANS NOW THAT I'M

259
00:06:30,907 --> 00:06:32,564
PREGNANT, I'M STARTING TO WISH

260
00:06:32,564 --> 00:06:34,566
PREGNANT, I'M STARTING TO WISH
THAT WE HAD BEEN MORE CAREFUL.

261
00:06:34,566 --> 00:06:42,540
THAT WE HAD BEEN MORE CAREFUL.

262
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,162
>> THE BIGGER I GET, THE MORE

263
00:06:44,162 --> 00:06:45,612
OVERWHELMING SCHOOL IS.

264
00:06:45,612 --> 00:06:47,096
MY SCHOOL COUNSELOR DOESN'T WANT

265
00:06:47,096 --> 00:06:48,753
ME TO DROP OUT, SO SHE BROUGHT

266
00:06:48,753 --> 00:06:50,064
ME IN TO TALK TO SOME OTHER

267
00:06:50,064 --> 00:06:51,411
STUDENTS WHO HAVE BEEN THROUGH

268
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,584
THE SAME THING.

269
00:06:52,584 --> 00:06:54,344
>> I WAS IN LABOR FOR, LIKE,

270
00:06:54,344 --> 00:06:55,207
32 HOURS.

271
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:56,036
IT SUCKED.

272
00:06:56,036 --> 00:06:56,692
>> OH, MY GOD.

273
00:06:56,692 --> 00:06:57,382
>> 32 HOURS?

274
00:06:57,382 --> 00:06:58,383
>> YEAH, SO I WENT AND GOT

275
00:06:58,383 --> 00:06:59,384
AN EPIDURAL AFTER, LIKE,

276
00:06:59,384 --> 00:07:00,834
THE FIRST 26.

277
00:07:00,834 --> 00:07:02,801
LIKE, YOUR CONTRACTIONS GO

278
00:07:02,801 --> 00:07:03,802
OFF THE CHART, THOUGH.

279
00:07:03,802 --> 00:07:04,493
IT SUCKS.

280
00:07:04,493 --> 00:07:05,321
IT HURTS.

281
00:07:05,321 --> 00:07:06,426
[laughter]

282
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,737
>> GET READY.

283
00:07:07,737 --> 00:07:08,669
>> THE FIRST NIGHT I BROUGHT HER

284
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:10,222
HOME, SHE CRIED THE WHOLE NIGHT.

285
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:11,223
AND I HADN'T SLEPT AT ALL

286
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,155
IN THE HOSPITAL.

287
00:07:12,155 --> 00:07:13,294
IT WAS, LIKE, THE HARDEST THING

288
00:07:13,294 --> 00:07:14,434
TO GO THROUGH, IS THE FIRST

289
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,262
NIGHT.

290
00:07:15,262 --> 00:07:16,297
AND THEN YOU GET AROUND TWO

291
00:07:16,297 --> 00:07:17,782
MONTHS, AND THEN THEY GET COLIC,

292
00:07:17,782 --> 00:07:19,162
WHICH IS, LIKE, THE WORST THING

293
00:07:19,162 --> 00:07:20,440
EVER, BECAUSE SHE CRIES,

294
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,511
AND NOTHING, NOTHING WILL HELP,

295
00:07:22,511 --> 00:07:23,926
NOT ONE THING.

296
00:07:23,926 --> 00:07:26,687
YOU'LL BE OKAY, THOUGH.

297
00:07:26,687 --> 00:07:27,861
>> BUT HOW ABOUT THE REST OF YOU

298
00:07:27,861 --> 00:07:29,207
GUYS, TRYING TO COME TO SCHOOL

299
00:07:29,207 --> 00:07:30,933
AND BE A MOM AT THE SAME TIME?

300
00:07:30,933 --> 00:07:32,486
>> UM, IT'S THE WHOLE HOMEWORK

301
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:33,211
THING.

302
00:07:33,211 --> 00:07:33,901
>> THE HOMEWORK?

303
00:07:33,901 --> 00:07:35,351
>> YEAH.

304
00:07:35,351 --> 00:07:37,111
I'D COME HOME AND THEN TAKE CARE

305
00:07:37,111 --> 00:07:38,458
OF HER, AND MY BOYFRIEND WOULD

306
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,288
GO, UM, HAVE FUN WITH HIS

307
00:07:41,288 --> 00:07:42,151
FRIENDS, 'CAUSE HE WATCHED HER

>> THESE GIRLS ARE FREAKING

310
00:07:46,431 --> 00:07:47,156

311
00:07:47,156 --> 00:07:48,226
I THOUGHT THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO

312
00:07:48,226 --> 00:07:52,402
MAKE ME FEEL BETTER.

313
00:07:52,402 --> 00:07:53,093
>> GO!

314
00:07:53,093 --> 00:07:53,956
GO, TEAM.

315
00:07:53,956 --> 00:07:54,957
HALT!

316
00:07:54,957 --> 00:07:56,303
WAIT FOR IT TO COME.

317
00:07:56,303 --> 00:07:56,959
smack!

318
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,408
>> I WAS EXCITED TO COMPETE

319
00:07:58,408 --> 00:07:59,824
ON THE DRILL TEAM THIS YEAR,

320
00:07:59,824 --> 00:08:01,101
BUT NOW I'VE BEEN FORCED

321
00:08:01,101 --> 00:08:05,415
TO SIT OUT.

322
00:08:05,415 --> 00:08:06,278
>> YEAH, EBONY, YOU GOTTA GIVE

323
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:06,934

00:08:08,073 --> 00:08:09,143
AMAZING.

326
00:08:09,143 --> 00:08:09,937
I LOVED YOU GUYS.

327
00:08:09,937 --> 00:08:10,800
>> I KNOW SHE WANTED TO DO THIS,

328
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,353
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, YOU KNOW,

329
00:08:12,353 --> 00:08:14,045
NONE OF US CAN DELIVER A BABY

330
00:08:14,045 --> 00:08:15,184
HERE, SO...

331
00:08:15,184 --> 00:08:16,979
IN SPIRIT, SHE'S WITH YOU.

332
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:18,463
IN PHYSICAL, THOUGH, A COUPLE

00:08:19,429 --> 00:08:20,879
BE SOMEWHERE ELSE, YOU KNOW,

335
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:21,777
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.

336
00:08:21,777 --> 00:08:24,607
SO GIVE EBONY A HAND FOR--

I'VE DREAMED OF JOINING

341
00:08:35,445 --> 00:08:38,414
THE AIR FORCE MY WHOLE LIFE.

342
00:08:38,414 --> 00:08:40,002
I HOPE I DON'T HAVE TO BAIL OUT

343
00:08:40,002 --> 00:08:43,177
NOW THAT I'M PREGNANT.

344
00:08:43,177 --> 00:08:45,939
WELL, I CAN GO INTO THE MILITARY

345
00:08:45,939 --> 00:08:47,285
AFTER SIX MONTHS.

346
00:08:47,285 --> 00:08:48,389
>> WELL, AFTER SIX MONTHS,

347
00:08:48,389 --> 00:08:49,977
RIGHT, BUT YOU ARE NOT GONNA BE

348
00:08:49,977 --> 00:08:51,185
WANTING TO LEAVE THAT BABY

00:08:51,185 --> 00:08:53,153
AFTER SIX MONTHS.

350
00:08:53,153 --> 00:08:54,361
>> I UNDERSTAND.

351
00:08:54,361 --> 00:08:56,328
>> SO YOU JUST NEED TO MAKE

352
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:57,813
A PLAN AND STICK WITH IT

353
00:08:57,813 --> 00:08:58,676
AND JUST SAY, "OKAY, THIS IS

354
00:08:58,676 --> 00:08:59,987
TEMPORARY THAT I'M AWAY

355
00:08:59,987 --> 00:09:01,541

>> YES.

359
00:09:04,474 --> 00:09:05,441
>> AFTER SIX MONTHS, I'D MISS

360
00:09:05,441 --> 00:09:06,718
HER FIRST STEPS AND HER FIRST

361
00:09:06,718 --> 00:09:07,547
WORDS, AND--AH.

362
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,859
>> EXACTLY.

363
00:09:09,859 --> 00:09:13,898
>> OH.

00:09:19,766 --> 00:09:21,250
BE STATIONED HERE?

371
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,009
>> I DON'T KNOW.

372
00:09:22,009 --> 00:09:24,978
WELL, THAT WAS MY PLAN, SO...

373
00:09:24,978 --> 00:09:25,944
>> BUT YOU DON'T ALWAYS GET

374
00:09:25,944 --> 00:09:26,635
STATIONED WHERE YOU GO TO

375
00:09:26,635 --> 00:09:27,325
