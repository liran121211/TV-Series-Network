1
00:00:03,737 --> 00:00:05,106
>> OH, THANK YOU.

2
00:00:05,106 --> 00:00:07,041
HEY, MY NAME IS MACI.

3
00:00:07,041 --> 00:00:07,975
I'M 16.

4
00:00:07,975 --> 00:00:08,776
I LIVE IN CHATTANOOGA,

5
00:00:08,776 --> 00:00:10,611
TENNESSEE, AND I'M A TOTAL

6
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:11,479
OVERACHIEVER.

7
00:00:11,479 --> 00:00:12,313
I GET GOOD GRADES,

8
00:00:12,313 --> 00:00:13,681
I PLAY SOFTBALL,

9
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:14,482
AND I'M EVEN ON

10
00:00:14,482 --> 00:00:15,983
THE CHEERLEADING SQUAD.

11
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:17,318
BUT DON'T LET THAT FOOL YOU.

12
00:00:17,318 --> 00:00:18,786
I DO HAVE A WILD SIDE.

13
00:00:18,786 --> 00:00:21,089
I'M ALL ABOUT DIRT BIKES.

14
00:00:21,089 --> 00:00:21,955
MY BOYFRIEND, RYAN,

15
00:00:21,955 --> 00:00:23,157
STARTED CHASING ME

16
00:00:23,157 --> 00:00:24,892
WHEN I WAS A SOPHOMORE.

17
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:26,394
I WASN'T INTO HIM AT FIRST

18
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:27,928
BECAUSE HE RIDES FOUR-WHEELERS,

19
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:30,231
WHICH, TO ME, ARE NOT COOL.

20
00:00:30,231 --> 00:00:31,299
BUT EVENTUALLY,

21
00:00:31,299 --> 00:00:33,601
HE SWEPT ME OFF MY FEET.

22
00:00:33,601 --> 00:00:36,003
HE EVEN PUT A RING ON MY FINGER.

23
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:38,272
[cheering]

24
00:00:38,272 --> 00:00:39,507
ALL MY FRIENDS ARE PSYCHED

25
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:40,774
FOR SENIOR YEAR,

26
00:00:40,774 --> 00:00:42,176
BUT I'M GRADUATING EARLY

27
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:43,444
AND MOVING IN WITH RYAN

28
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:45,446
BECAUSE...

29
00:00:45,446 --> 00:00:47,415
I'M PREGNANT.

30
00:00:47,415 --> 00:00:50,284
>> * MAKE IT RIGHT

31
00:00:50,284 --> 00:00:53,621
* MAKE IT PERFECT

32
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:57,858
>> OKAY, HEY.

33
00:00:57,858 --> 00:00:58,526
>> HEY.

34
00:00:58,526 --> 00:00:59,193
WHAT YOU DOING?

35
00:00:59,193 --> 00:00:59,860
>> NOTHING.

36
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:00,528
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

37
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:01,429
>> MY HIGH SCHOOL FRIENDS

38
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:02,163
STILL LIVE AT HOME

39
00:01:02,163 --> 00:01:03,297
WITH THEIR PARENTS,

40
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:04,465
SO THEY THINK IT'S REALLY COOL

41
00:01:04,465 --> 00:01:06,567
I HAVE MY OWN PLACE.

42
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:07,235
I BOUGHT THAT COUCH

43
00:01:07,235 --> 00:01:08,269
WITH MY OWN MONEY.

44
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:09,002
>> DID YOU REALLY?

45
00:01:09,002 --> 00:01:09,937
>> YES.

46
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:11,505
I SAVED UP MY

47
00:01:11,505 --> 00:01:14,408
$7-AN-HOUR PAYCHECKS.

48
00:01:14,408 --> 00:01:15,409
>> LET'S GO SEE BENTLEY'S ROOM.

49
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:16,844
>> OKAY, BENTLEY'S ROOM.

50
00:01:16,844 --> 00:01:18,579
IT'S VERY MESSY.

51
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:19,513
>> OH, MY GOSH.

52
00:01:19,513 --> 00:01:20,681
THESE ARE ALL OF HIS CLOTHES?

53
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:22,216
>> YES, HE HAS A MILLION.

54
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:24,452
>> OH, LOOK AT HIS CRIB.

55
00:01:24,452 --> 00:01:25,753
>> LOOK AT HIS LITTLE ONESIES

56
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:27,655
THAT ARE, LIKE, HARD-CORE.

57
00:01:27,655 --> 00:01:28,422
>> WE'RE HAVING A BOY,

58
00:01:28,422 --> 00:01:29,390
AND WE'RE GONNA NAME HIM

59
00:01:29,390 --> 00:01:32,293
BENTLEY.

60
00:01:32,293 --> 00:01:33,026
>> MACI, HOW DID YOU TELL

61
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:36,864
YOUR MOM YOU WERE PREGNANT?

62
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:38,299
>> THROUGH A TEXT MESSAGE.

63
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:40,868
[laughter]

64
00:01:40,868 --> 00:01:42,303
>> THAT'S AWFUL.

65
00:01:42,303 --> 00:01:43,070
>> I WOULD HAVE JUST, LIKE,

66
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:44,071
NEVER TOLD MY PARENTS.

67
00:01:44,071 --> 00:01:45,573
>> LIKE, "MOM, I GOT"--

68
00:01:45,573 --> 00:01:46,740
[laughter]

69
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,775
"JUST A LITTLE BLOATED."

70
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:48,776
>> DID YOU JUST, LIKE, SAY--

71
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:49,443
WHAT DID YOU SAY,

72
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,278
"I'M PREGNANT"?

73
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:51,044
>> I WAS SITTING IN CLASS,

74
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:52,480
AND I SAID, "HI, MOM."

75
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:53,714
SHE SAID, "HI."

76
00:01:53,714 --> 00:01:54,682
I SAID, "I HAVE TO TELL YOU

77
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:55,583
SOMETHING."

78
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:57,451
TOOK A FEW DEEP BREATHS,

79
00:01:57,451 --> 00:01:59,687
AND THEN I TEXTED,

80
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:02,156
"I'M PREGNANT" TO HER.

81
00:02:02,156 --> 00:02:03,157
AND SHE SAID,

82
00:02:03,157 --> 00:02:04,625
"WELL, IF YOU'RE JOKING,

83
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:05,759
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

84
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:06,894
IF YOU'RE FOR REAL,

85
00:02:06,894 --> 00:02:07,761
WE ARE NOT HAVING THIS

86
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:09,930
CONVERSATION VIA TEXT MESSAGE."

87
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,532
YEAH, AND THEN WHEN I GOT HOME,

88
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:12,700
MY DAD AND MY MOM WERE SITTING

89
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,401
AT THE KITCHEN TABLE

90
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:14,168
WAITING ON ME.

91
00:02:14,168 --> 00:02:15,569
>> WERE YOU CRYING?

92
00:02:15,569 --> 00:02:16,304
>> RIGHT WHEN I WALKED IN,

93
00:02:16,304 --> 00:02:17,137
I WASN'T CRYING,

94
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,572
BUT MY MOM GOT UP FROM THE TABLE

95
00:02:18,572 --> 00:02:20,040
AND HUGGED ME, AND THEN WE,

96
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,475
LIKE, BOTH STARTED CRYING.

97
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:23,211
AND THEN IT WAS AWFUL.

98
00:02:23,211 --> 00:02:23,877
IT WAS SAD.

99
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:24,612
>> YOU NEVER CRY.

100
00:02:24,612 --> 00:02:25,279
>> I KNOW.

101
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:26,447
>> NEVER.

102
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:28,216
>> MACI, IT'S OKAY.

103
00:02:28,216 --> 00:02:29,317
>> IT'S GREAT TO HAVE SUCH

104
00:02:29,317 --> 00:02:31,185
A SUPPORTIVE GROUP OF FRIENDS.

105
00:02:31,185 --> 00:02:32,686
I HOPE THINGS GO SMOOTHLY

106
00:02:32,686 --> 00:02:34,622
WITH MY NEW EXPANDED FAMILY.

107
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:36,357
JUST DON'T--I SEE YOUR DAD

108
00:02:36,357 --> 00:02:39,059
JUST BEING TOO OUTGOING

109
00:02:39,059 --> 00:02:39,893
FOR MY DAD.

110
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:40,661
>> PROBABLY.

111
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:41,562
>> THEY WON'T HAVE ANYTHING

112
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:43,597
TO TALK ABOUT.

113
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:45,266
>> CARS.

114
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:47,268
>> I GUESS.

115
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,104
>> I MEAN, THERE'S SOMETHING

116
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,706
GOING ON HERE.

117
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,308
>> SHE SAID, "I'M PREGNANT."

118
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:55,776
[laughter]

119
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:56,810
I LOOKED AT THE CALENDAR

120
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,279
TO SEE IF IT WAS APRIL FOOLS,

121
00:02:58,279 --> 00:02:59,213
AND IT WASN'T.

122
00:02:59,213 --> 00:02:59,880
>> YOU CAN IMAGINE

123
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:00,981
HOW SHOCKED OUR PARENTS WERE

124
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:02,583
WHEN THEY FIRST FOUND OUT,

125
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:04,452
BUT MY DAD DIDN'T KILL RYAN,

126
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:05,118
AND THEY ARE TRYING

127
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:05,819
TO BE SUPPORTIVE.

128
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:06,487
>> FOR SOME REASON,

129
00:03:06,487 --> 00:03:07,321
WE GOT TALKING ABOUT THE WHOLE

130
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:09,490
EPIDURAL THING, AND I WAS LIKE,

131
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:11,191
"YEAH, I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA

132
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:11,959
DO IT WITH THE EPIDURAL."

133
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:12,626
SHE GOES,

134
00:03:12,626 --> 00:03:15,229
"HA, KEEP AN OPEN MIND."

135
00:03:15,229 --> 00:03:15,996
>> HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT,

136
00:03:15,996 --> 00:03:16,630
RYAN?

137
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,531
DO YOU WANT HER TO GET

138
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:18,332
AN EPIDURAL?

139
00:03:18,332 --> 00:03:19,367
>> YEAH, GET THE SPINAL TAP.

140
00:03:19,367 --> 00:03:20,033
>> WHY?

141
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:21,969
>> [laughs] SPINAL TAP.

142
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:22,970
>> HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO

143
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,272
IN THE OPERATING ROOM?

144
00:03:24,272 --> 00:03:25,105
>> I DON'T KNOW.

145
00:03:25,105 --> 00:03:25,773
>> I KNOW.

146
00:03:25,773 --> 00:03:26,507
>> YOU'LL PROBABLY BE

147
00:03:26,507 --> 00:03:27,207
THE COLOR OF YOUR SHIRT.

148
00:03:27,207 --> 00:03:28,075
THEY'LL PROBABLY NEED TO GIVE

149
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:28,709
YOU SOME DRUGS.

150
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:29,377
>> I KNOW.

151
00:03:29,377 --> 00:03:30,244
THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO BE,

152
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:30,878
LIKE, TENDING TO YOU

153
00:03:30,878 --> 00:03:32,613
WHILE I'M GIVING BIRTH.

154
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:35,516
[laughter]

155
00:03:35,516 --> 00:03:36,950
I HAVE A LOT TO HANDLE

156
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,886
AT ONLY 16.

157
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:39,920
RYAN WORKS THE NIGHT SHIFT

158
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,121
AS A DIESEL MECHANIC,

159
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:42,790
AND I HELP MAKE ENDS MEET

160
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,191
WORKING PART-TIME WITH MY DAD.

161
00:03:44,191 --> 00:03:46,093
THIS IS NOT HOW I PICTURED

162
00:03:46,093 --> 00:03:48,262
MY SENIOR YEAR.

163
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:50,798
>> * HOW DOES IT FEEL

164
00:03:50,798 --> 00:03:54,167
* TO NEVER DISCOVER

165
00:03:54,167 --> 00:03:55,469
* THAT YOU AND I...

166
00:03:55,469 --> 00:03:56,404
>> SO YOU'RE COMING TO

167
00:03:56,404 --> 00:03:57,605
THE BABY SHOWER SUNDAY?

168
00:03:57,605 --> 00:03:58,672
>> YOU DO NOT NEED

169
00:03:58,672 --> 00:03:59,973
ANY MORE STUFF.

170
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,008
>> YES, I DO.

171
00:04:01,008 --> 00:04:01,709
I DON'T EVEN HAVE

172
00:04:01,709 --> 00:04:03,010
HALF THE STUFF I NEED.

173
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,111
>> YOU'VE GOT MORE THAN ENOUGH

174
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:05,245
TO FILL UP HIS ROOM.

175
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,514
>> WELL, OKAY.

176
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:08,081
DON'T YOU HAVE MORE STUFF

177
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,183
THAN WHAT'S IN YOUR ROOM?

178
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:10,918
>> I GUESS, BUT--

179
00:04:10,918 --> 00:04:13,821
>> OKAY.

180
00:04:15,723 --> 00:04:17,190
IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME

181
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:18,191
I BRING UP SOMETHING

182
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:19,660
BABY-RELATED, RYAN'S NOT

183
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,695
INTERESTED IN TALKING ABOUT IT.

184
00:04:21,695 --> 00:04:22,830
I'M TELLING YOU.

185
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:25,999
HE'S GONNA RIDE DIRT BIKES.

186
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:26,734
>> WHATEVER.

187
00:04:26,734 --> 00:04:27,668
>> 'CAUSE BENTLEY'S NOT RIDING

188
00:04:27,668 --> 00:04:29,603
FOUR-WHEELERS.

189
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:38,211
>> RYAN, HE'LL BE A BABY.

190
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:40,414

I'M TAKING CARE OF TWO BABIES.

782

BUT I HOPE HE REALIZES

784
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:09,061
THAT BEING A FATHER

785
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:10,597
IS MORE THAN HAVING YOUR BABY'S

786
00:22:10,597 --> 00:22:12,465

>> EVEN WITH CASH INCENTIVE,

813
00:22:57,276 --> 00:22:58,711
I'M WORRIED THAT RYAN WON'T DO
