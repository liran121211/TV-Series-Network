00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,755
OF MY LIFE TO MAKE.

190
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:04,665
>> MY EX FINALLY GOT THE PICTURE

191
00:06:04,665 --> 00:06:05,799
WHEN I GOT A NEW PHONE AND I

192
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:09,670
DIDN'T GIVE HIM THE NEW NUMBER.

193
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,871
NOW I FEEL LIKE MORE THAN EVER

194
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:11,905
I KNOW WHAT I WANT.

195
00:06:11,905 --> 00:06:13,173
IT'S TIME TO TELL MY MOM WHAT

196
00:06:13,173 --> 00:06:16,944
I'M THINKING.

197
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:20,080
>> IT'S NOT EASY TO HAVE A CHILD

198
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,416
BY YOURSELF, LET ALONE BE

199
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:25,252
A TEENAGER, LET ALONE NOT HAVING

200
00:06:25,252 --> 00:06:28,589
A DEGREE, NOT HAVING A GOOD JOB,

201
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:30,558
YOU KNOW?

202
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:31,959
YOU KNOW, IT'S AMAZING HOW MANY

203
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:33,461
PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ABOUT YOUR

204
00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:35,128
BABY.

205
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:36,530
>> MOM, IF OTHER PEOPLE WHO

206
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:37,665
IT'S NOT PART OF THEM WANT TO

207
00:06:37,665 --> 00:06:38,899
HAVE IT, WHY WOULDN'T YOU WANT

208
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,100
TO HAVE IT?

209
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,535
>> BABY, I'M JUST THINKING

210
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:42,302
ABOUT YOU.

211
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:43,971
>> [laughs] I JUST THINK--

212
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:45,405
OKAY.

213
00:06:45,405 --> 00:06:46,940
>> SO WHAT DID YOU DECIDE ABOUT

214
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:49,743
YOUR BABY?

215
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:51,779
>> WE'RE FOR SURE KEEPING IT.

216
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:53,581
>> WE'RE KEEPING THE BABY, HUH?

217
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:56,149
>> YEAH.

218
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:57,651
SO IT'S DECIDED.

219
00:06:57,651 --> 00:06:59,352
I'M GOING TO BE A SINGLE MOM.

220
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:01,088
BUT KEEPING THE BABY DOESN'T

221
00:07:01,088 --> 00:07:02,155
MEAN MY PROBLEMS AT SCHOOL HAVE

222
00:07:02,155 --> 00:07:04,692
GONE AWAY.

223
00:07:04,692 --> 00:07:06,293
I FEEL LIKE I'M THE CENTER

224
00:07:06,293 --> 00:07:08,295
OF AWKWARD STARES.

225
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:14,267
[girl laughs]

226
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,069
>> WHAT ARE YOU LAUGHING AT?

227
00:07:16,069 --> 00:07:18,238
I'M ABOUT READY TO REDIRECT

228
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:20,240
SOMEONE'S MOUTH.

229
00:07:24,845 --> 00:07:26,446
EVEN THE CHEERLEADERS ARE ACTING

230
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,448
STRANGE.

231
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:29,349
THANK GOD FOR TYLER.

232
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:30,818
HE DIDN'T JUDGE ME AT ALL.

233
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:31,785
>> I'M JUST GONNA DO THE REGULAR

234
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:32,686
TANNING WHILE YOU'RE SPRAYING.

235
00:07:32,686 --> 00:07:33,487
THAT WAY WE'RE DONE AT THE

236
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:34,154
SAME TIME.

237
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:35,589
>> IS IT OKAY IF I SIT IN HIS

238
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:36,757
ROOM WHILE HE TANS--WITH HIM.

239
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:37,525
IS THAT OKAY?

240
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:38,191
>> YEAH.

241
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:39,059
>> OKAY.

242
00:07:39,059 --> 00:07:39,727
[Tyler chuckles]

243
00:07:39,727 --> 00:07:41,662
>> OKAY.

244
00:07:41,662 --> 00:07:42,730
>> GIRLS ARE DRAMA.

245
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:43,531
IF YOU'RE NOT TELLING THE

246
00:07:43,531 --> 00:07:45,198
PEOPLE, THEN APPARENTLY THEN

247
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,233
THAT IS YOUR BUSINESS,

248
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:47,200
NOT THEIRS.

249
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,401
>> IT WAS ZABRINA TALKING ABOUT

250
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:49,269
ME BEHIND MY BACK,

251
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:50,470
CAUSING [bleep]

252
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,039
WITH ME AND THE OTHER GIRLS.

253
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:53,240
IF YOU'RE GONNA ACT LIKE THAT,

254
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,508
THAT'S NOT A TRUE FRIEND.

255
00:07:54,508 --> 00:07:55,676
>> AND YOU KNOW THEY JUDGE YOU

256
00:07:55,676 --> 00:07:56,610
'CAUSE YOU'RE A SINGLE MOM.

257
00:07:56,610 --> 00:07:57,277
LIKE--

258
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:57,978
>> THEY'RE SUPPOSED

259
00:07:57,978 --> 00:07:58,612
TO BE LEADERS,

260
00:07:58,612 --> 00:07:59,880
AND THEY'RE JUST NOTHING.

261
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,749
>> CHEER "LEADERS."

262
00:08:01,749 --> 00:08:03,283
NOT CHEER "FOLLOWERS."

263
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:04,184
>> I DON'T CARE ABOUT WHAT THEY

264
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:04,885
THINK ABOUT ME.

265
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:05,786
I DON'T EVEN CARE.

266
00:08:05,786 --> 00:08:08,121
WHO CARES?

267
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:18,566
>> SO WHEN ARE WE GONNA DO THE

268
00:08:18,566 --> 00:08:19,800
SENIOR PICTURE?

269
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,035
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE

270
00:08:22,035 --> 00:08:23,737
I DON'T HOW I'M GONNA BE AFTER

271
00:08:23,737 --> 00:08:24,404
I'M PREGNANT.

272
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:25,205
SO IS IT GONNA TAKE, LIKE,

273
00:08:25,205 --> 00:08:29,176
A MONTH FOR ME TO BE OKAY OR--

274
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:30,644
>> SO AFTER YOU HAVE THE BABY,

275
00:08:30,644 --> 00:08:31,779
YOU'RE PROBABLY GONNA BE ALL

276
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:32,780
PUFFED UP.

277
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,447
>> NO, I PLAN ON NOT BEING

278
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,649
THAT PUFFED UP, AND I PLAN

279
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:36,416
ON WORKING OUT.

280
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,184
>> WELL, YOU MAY PLAN ON IT,

281
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,786
BUT THAT'S NOT THE WAY IT GOES.

282
00:08:38,786 --> 00:08:40,087
>> [laughs]

283
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:41,454
WELL, WE'LL BE SURPRISED,

284
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:42,422
WON'T WE, MOM?

285
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:43,557
I NEED TO LEAVE.

286
00:08:43,557 --> 00:08:44,892
I WENT OUT FOR PIZZA WITH THE

287
00:08:44,892 --> 00:08:46,827
TEAM, BUT THEY WERE STILL ACTING

288
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:49,462
REALLY WEIRD.

289
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,031
HELLO, HELLO.

290
00:08:51,031 --> 00:08:52,299
HOW ARE YOU, LADIES?

291
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:53,967
[silence]

292
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:56,403
ARE YOU GUYS HUNGRY AT ALL?

293
00:08:56,403 --> 00:08:58,338
OKAY, JUST IGNORE ME.

294
00:08:58,338 --> 00:08:59,840
HEY, TY, WILL YOU, LIKE, SIT

295
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,774
AT THE SAME TABLE AS ME?

296
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:01,709
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TABLE

297
00:09:01,709 --> 00:09:03,711
YOU WERE SITTING AT, SO...

298
00:09:08,582 --> 00:09:09,650
>> I THINK MY FRIENDSHIP WITH

299
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:12,185
ZABRINA MIGHT BE OVER FOR GOOD.

300
00:09:16,156 --> 00:09:17,190
THESE ARE SUPPOSED TO BE MY BEST

301
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:19,292
FRIENDS, BUT I DON'T HAVE TIME

302
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:20,661
FOR HIGH SCHOOL OR THE CHEER

303
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:21,528
TEAM IF THIS IS HOW THEY'RE

304
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:22,529
GOING TO TREAT ME.

305
00:09:22,529 --> 00:09:24,531
I QUIT.

306
00:09:34,307 --> 00:09:35,609
>> AS MY BELLY CONTINUED TO

307
00:09:35,609 --> 00:09:37,144
GROW, SO DID THE GOSSIP

308
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:38,511
AROUND HIGH SCHOOL, AND IT

309
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,781
QUICKLY BECAME UNBEARABLE.

310
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:42,549
SO MY MOM AND I DECIDED I SHOULD

311
00:09:42,549 --> 00:09:44,317
STOP ATTENDING THOMAS JEFFERSON

312
00:09:44,317 --> 00:09:45,953
AND FINISH MY REMAINING CREDITS

313
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:49,256
AT THE LOCAL COLLEGE.

314
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:50,090
>> SO WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR

315
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:53,060
ARE CLASSES THAT SHE CAN TAKE

316
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:54,561
WITHOUT HAVING TO COME, MAYBE,

317
00:09:54,561 --> 00:09:55,896
TO CLASS, BUT DO SOMETHING

318
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:56,964
ONLINE.

319
00:09:56,964 --> 00:09:57,898
>> ONE THING STUDENTS DON'T

320
00:09:57,898 --> 00:09:58,766
UNDERSTAND: YOU HAVE TO BE VERY

321
00:09:58,766 --> 00:10:00,834
DISCIPLINED, 'CAUSE COMING TO

322
00:10:00,834 --> 00:10:02,435

00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,171
MOTIVATED TO COME, BUT HERE,

324
00:10:04,171 --> 00:10:05,238
THERE'S NOBODY, YOU KNOW,

ACTUALLY MAKING YOU TURN IN

326
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:07,908
THE HOMEWORK.

327
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:08,809
YOU HAVE TO TURN IT IN YOURSELF.

328
00:10:08,809 --> 00:10:09,677
>> WELL, WE ALL HAVE TO BE

329
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:11,679
GROWN-UP SOMETIMES.

330
00:10:11,679 --> 00:10:13,747
>> I MEAN, WORKING, BEING

331
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:15,916
A MOTHER, BEING A STUDENT ALL AT

332
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:19,019
ONCE, IT'S A LOT TO TAKE ON.

ME DEAL WITH EVERYTHING.

337
00:10:26,126 --> 00:10:27,795
I FOUND OUT I'M HAVING A GIRL,

338
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:28,528
AND I'M GOING

339
00:10:28,528 --> 00:10:29,362
TO NAME HER SOPHIA.

340
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,831
AND TODAY WE GET TO HEAR

341
00:10:30,831 --> 00:10:33,400

SOMETHING.

00:10:59,526 --> 00:11:00,560
>> WELL, HOW COULD YOU HEAR

359
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,462
THE HEART OVER THERE?

562
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,103
AND YOU JUST THINK THEY'RE GONNA

563
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:43,836
HANDLE THIS.

564
00:16:43,836 --> 00:16:45,672
I DO NOT HAVE TO ASK ALL THESE

565
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,340
GROTESQUE QUESTIONS.

566
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,275
>> WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS

567
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:50,343
PRIVATELY IF IT'S MAKING THEM

568
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,278
UNCOMFORTABLE.

569
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:54,147
>> I HAVE TO KNOW.

570
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:55,682
I WAS HOPING FOR MORE SUPPORT

571
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:57,050
FROM MY FAMILY.

572
00:16:57,050 --> 00:16:58,285
I'M SCARED I'M GOING TO HAVE

573
00:16:58,285 --> 00:17:00,453
TO DO THIS BY MYSELF.

577
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:17,904
>> IT'S SO COLD.

578
00:17:19,239 --> 00:17:20,107
>> GOT TO SET THIS SOMEWHERE

579
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:20,873
WHERE IT CAN DRY.

580
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,476
>> MOM, DO NOT BEND IT.

581
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:25,011
WITH MY DUE DATE GETTING CLOSER,

582
00:17:25,011 --> 00:17:26,613
EVERYONE IS GETTING MORE AND

583
00:17:26,613 --> 00:17:27,947
MORE EXCITED.

584
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:29,116
IT'S TIME FOR THE BABY SHOWER.

585
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:31,151
HELLO, EVERYONE.

586
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:33,653
>> I LOVE THEM.

587
00:17:33,653 --> 00:17:35,455
>> SHOES.

588
00:17:35,455 --> 00:17:36,356
THESE ARE CUTE.

589
00:17:36,356 --> 00:17:38,024
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S HANDMADE OR

590
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:39,459
ANYTHING, BUT IT'S REALLY CUTE.

591
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:40,493
GETTING ALL THESE BABY ITEMS

592
00:17:40,493 --> 00:17:42,195
REMINDED ME THAT IN JUST A SHORT

593
00:17:42,195 --> 00:17:44,631
TIME, I'M GOING TO BE A MOM.

594
00:17:53,106 --> 00:17:56,343
MOM!

00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:01,814
>> ALL RIGHT, JUST BE CALM.

598
00:18:01,814 --> 00:18:02,849
LET'S GO SEE.

599
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:06,386
LET'S SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE.

600
00:18:06,386 --> 00:18:08,087
>> I DON'T KNOW.

601
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,756
>> YEAH, THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKS

602
00:18:09,756 --> 00:18:11,658

LET'S GET YOUR COAT.

610
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,934
YOU WANT SOME SOCKS?

611
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,069
>> YEAH, I'LL GET SOME SOCKS.

612
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:24,671
AND GRAB MY BAG.

613
00:18:24,671 --> 00:18:25,605
>> ALL RIGHT.

614
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:26,739
ARE YOU READY?

>> OKAY, MOM, HOLD ON.

619
00:18:39,819 --> 00:18:42,021
MY DAD'S OUT OF TOWN FOR WORK,

620
00:18:42,021 --> 00:18:43,690
AND MY SISTER IS REALLY SICK,

621
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,658
SO SHE CAN'T COME.

622
00:18:45,658 --> 00:18:46,826
I THINK MY MOM IS NERVOUS THAT

623
00:18:46,826 --> 00:18:47,727
SHE'LL HAVE TO HELP ME

624
00:18:47,727 --> 00:18:51,231
BY HERSELF.

625

GOING TO BE HAVING THE BABY.

632
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,144
SO HER WATER BROKE, SO WE'RE

633
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,146
MOVING ON HERE.

634
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:11,884
>> OKAY. BYE.

637
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:17,557
JUST KEEP IT TOGETHER.

638
00:19:17,557 --> 00:19:20,727

CRY RIGHT NOW, MOM.

642
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:26,933
OBVIOUSLY, I DO NOT NEED TO BE

643
00:19:26,933 --> 00:19:31,170
DOING THAT.

00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:34,207
[sighs]

645
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,481
THE CONTRACTIONS ARE QUICKER,

646
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:42,449
AND THE PAIN IS BECOMING

647
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:44,451
UNBEARABLE.

648
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:51,424
THIS IS INTENSE.

YOU'VE BEEN DOING REALLY GOOD,

655
00:20:01,601 --> 00:20:02,269
BABY.

656
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:04,937
I'M VERY PROUD OF YOU.

657
00:20:04,937 --> 00:20:07,206
>> SHE IS NOT LIKING THIS PART.

658
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:09,476
>> SHE'S--WE HAVE TO TALK TO

659
00:20:09,476 --> 00:20:11,844
HER, KEEP HER OCCUPIED.

660
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:13,546

IT'S TIME FOR THE EPIDURAL.

662
00:20:15,782 --> 00:20:16,849
>> OKAY, I'M JUST GONNA HAVE YOU

663
00:20:16,849 --> 00:20:18,418
KIND OF TURN YOUR LEGS OVER,

664
00:20:18,418 --> 00:20:19,819

665
00:20:19,819 --> 00:20:20,687
OKAY.

666
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:21,854
I'M GONNA DROP THIS SIDE RAIL

667

>> OH.

669
00:20:25,758 --> 00:20:27,327
I WANT TO BE REALLY STILL.

670
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:28,227
>> MM-HMM, YOU'RE DOING FINE.

671
00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:29,161
YOU'RE DOING JUST FINE.

672
00:20:29,161 --> 00:20:30,096
>> SO I'M JUST PUSHING

673

ON YOUR BACK--

674
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:31,998

>> IT IS OKAY?

677
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:35,435
>> IT'S JUST MY HANDS--

678
00:20:35,435 --> 00:20:36,903
>> SHE'S JUST TRYING TO FIND OUT

679
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,505
WHAT TO DO FOR YOU, THAT'S ALL,

680
00:20:38,505 --> 00:20:40,840
BABY.

681
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,241

I'M NOT GONNA WANT YOU TO PUT

685
00:20:44,877 --> 00:20:46,245
YOUR HANDS BACK HERE, OKAY?

686
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,247
>> OKAY.

687
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:54,987
CAN YOU GRAB ME HARDER,

688
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:55,655
PLEASE?

689
00:20:55,655 --> 00:20:57,790
AM I IN THE PROPER--

690
00:20:57,790 --> 00:20:58,858
>> YOU'RE NOT MOVING AT ALL.

691
00:20:58,858 --> 00:21:00,893
YOU'RE GOOD.

692
00:21:00,893 --> 00:21:02,128
JUST GONNA GET NICE AND CENTERED

693
00:21:02,128 --> 00:21:03,296
IN THE BED.

KIND OF TIP OVER.

699
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:11,103
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ROLL OVER

700
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,839
VERY FAR.

701
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:13,840
OKAY?

702
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:14,607
>> YOU'RE ALMOST THERE.

703

>> AND THEN ROLL BACK FOR ME,

704
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,878
SO YOU'RE JUST TIPPED A LITTLE.

705

PERFECT.

706
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:22,148
OKAY?

707
00:21:27,587 --> 00:21:28,588
>> WONDER WHO THAT IS.

708
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:29,956
>> WELL, HELLO.

709
00:21:29,956 --> 00:21:31,023

>> YEAH.

714

I THINK I WAS LOSING MY MIND

715
00:21:37,096 --> 00:21:37,764
EARLIER.

716
00:21:37,764 --> 00:21:38,531
>> NO, NO, NOT AT ALL.

717
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:39,666
I ALWAYS TELL PEOPLE, "IF I HAD

718
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:40,867

>> AS YOU TAKE THE BABY OUT...

725
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:48,841
>> UH-HUH?

726
00:21:48,841 --> 00:21:50,510
>> I'M, YOU KNOW, NOT REAL GOOD

727
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:51,744
WITH THESE KIND OF THINGS, BUT--

728
00:21:51,744 --> 00:21:52,545
>> SHE'S SUPPOSED TO TAKE

729
00:21:52,545 --> 00:21:53,212
A PICTURE.

ALL RIGHT, WELL, I'M GONNA GO

738
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,621
PUT MY WORK CLOTHES ON.

739
00:22:01,621 --> 00:22:04,524
>> OKAY.

740
00:22:04,524 --> 00:22:05,758
NOW THAT MY DOCTOR HAS

741
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:07,394
ARRIVED AND MY CONTRACTIONS ARE

742
00:22:07,394 --> 00:22:09,328
COMING FASTER, IT'S TIME TO

743
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:10,597
START PUSHING.

744
00:22:10,597 --> 00:22:11,598
>> THE BETTER SHAPE YOU'RE IN

745
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:13,733
WHEN YOU COME IN IN LABOR

746
00:22:13,733 --> 00:22:15,201
IS ALWAYS A GOOD THING

747
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:17,737
'CAUSE THIS IS A LOT OF WORK.

937
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,457
>> YOU CAN PUT HER, LIKE,

938
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,027
IN THE SINK.

939
00:27:08,027 --> 00:27:09,228
>> DO YOU WANT YOUR LITTLE

940
00:27:09,228 --> 00:27:11,798
THINGY?

941
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:14,734
NO, YOU DON'T.

942
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:16,936
BECAUSE MY DAD WAS WORKING

943
00:27:16,936 --> 00:27:17,904
OUT OF TOWN, HE WAS THE

944
00:27:17,904 --> 00:27:18,838
LAST TO SHOW UP.

945
00:27:18,838 --> 00:27:19,638
>> THERE YOU GO.

946
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,207
>> ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.

947
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:22,241
>> YOU BET.

948
00:27:22,241 --> 00:27:23,042
>> FROM MY LITTLE BABY,

949
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:24,343
MY FIRST GRANDDAUGHTER.

950
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:26,779
>> AH, WELL, CONGRATULATIONS.

951
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:29,281
>> WELL, LOOK WHO HAS THE BABY.

952
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:31,083
>> I FINALLY GOT THE BABY.

953
00:27:31,083 --> 00:27:31,984
[Sophia whimpers]

954
00:27:31,984 --> 00:27:32,651
>> YEAH...

955
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,686
>> SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

956
00:27:33,686 --> 00:27:34,754
LOOK AT THAT.

957
00:27:34,754 --> 00:27:36,756
>> IT'S A MIRACLE.

958
00:27:39,959 --> 00:27:41,761
BEFORE I KNEW IT, IT WAS TIME

959
00:27:41,761 --> 00:27:44,063
TO TAKE SOPHIA HOME.

960
00:27:52,138 --> 00:27:55,141
>> SOPHIA, WELCOME TO YOUR HOME.

961
00:27:57,143 --> 00:27:58,110
>> I'M GONNA JUST CHANGE HER

962
00:27:58,110 --> 00:28:01,113
AND EVERYTHING HERE.

963
00:28:01,113 --> 00:28:01,881
>> YOU'RE GONNA PUT HER

964
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:02,982
ON THE TABLE?

965
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:04,550
>> WELL, WHY CAN'T I?

966
00:28:04,550 --> 00:28:05,451
>> WELL, THE TABLE'S HARD.

967
00:28:05,451 --> 00:28:06,585
SHE'S USED TO SOMETHING NICE

968
00:28:06,585 --> 00:28:07,486
AND SOFT.

969
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:09,989
>> YEAH. OKAY.

970
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:11,958
OHH.

971
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:13,192
GET YOUR PANT LEG ON.

972
00:28:13,192 --> 00:28:14,727
YEAH.

973
00:28:14,727 --> 00:28:18,664
[Sophia crying softly]

974
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:21,700
>> FARRAH, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO

975
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:22,902
WATCH IT 'CAUSE WHEN SHE GETS

976
00:28:22,902 --> 00:28:24,036
A LITTLE OLDER AND STARTS

977
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:25,171
ROLLING, YOU CAN'T JUST LEAVE

978
00:28:25,171 --> 00:28:26,739
HER LAY LIKE THAT.

979
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:27,774
>> IT'S PROBABLY NOT A GOOD

980
00:28:27,774 --> 00:28:29,375
IDEA.

981
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:30,309
>> JUST THINK, YOU'RE GETTING

982
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:32,311
AN EDUCATION THERE.

983
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:38,684
>> GIVE ME, GIVE ME, GIVE ME.

984
00:28:38,684 --> 00:28:40,252
>> SHE'S A HUNGRY LITTLE BABY.

985
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:41,187
>> I DON'T KNOW WHY SHE JUST

986
00:28:41,187 --> 00:28:44,156
BURPED ALL THAT UP, THOUGH.

987
00:28:44,156 --> 00:28:45,324
I WAS SO EXCITED WHEN WE GOT

988
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:47,593
SOPHIA HOME, BUT I HAD NO IDEA

989
00:28:47,593 --> 00:28:48,694
IT WAS GOING TO BE THIS MUCH

990
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:49,962
WORK.

991
00:28:49,962 --> 00:28:50,963
MY MOM WAS RIGHT.

992
00:28:50,963 --> 00:28:52,965
IT'S EXHAUSTING.

993
00:28:55,768 --> 00:28:58,537
[Sophia fussing]

994
00:28:58,537 --> 00:28:59,839
OVER THE PAST THREE DAYS,

995
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,507
EVERYTHING'S BEEN ABOUT SOPHIA.

996
00:29:01,507 --> 00:29:02,909
I'M STARTING TO WONDER IF I'M

997
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:04,343
EVER GOING TO GET ANY SLEEP

998
00:29:04,343 --> 00:29:05,377
AT ALL.

999
00:29:05,377 --> 00:29:06,946
>> ARE YOU RUBBING HER FEET?

1000
00:29:06,946 --> 00:29:08,214
>> WELL, I WAS, BUT THEN SHE

1001
00:29:08,214 --> 00:29:09,081
SEEMED FINE, AND I DIDN'T WANT

1002
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:10,850
TO MAKE HER COLD.

1003
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:13,185
[Sophia crying]

1004
00:29:13,185 --> 00:29:14,553
>> OH, MY GOD, NOW YOU'RE GONNA

1005
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:16,088
PUT HANDCUFFS ON THE BABY.

1006
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:17,389
>> MOM, THEY HAD THESE AT--

1007
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:18,590
>> SHE'S GOT TO LEARN TO WORK

1008
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,127
HER--HER ARMS AND HER HANDS.

1009
00:29:21,127 --> 00:29:22,294
>> I DON'T WANT HER SCRATCHING,

1010
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:23,362
MOM; THAT'S BAD.

1011
00:29:23,362 --> 00:29:24,931
>> WELL, HERE'S A NEWS FLASH:

1012
00:29:24,931 --> 00:29:26,398
I NEVER, EVER DID THAT TO YOU,

1013
00:29:26,398 --> 00:29:29,435
AND LOOK AT YOU; YOU'RE OKAY.

1014
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:30,402
>> MY MOM IS STARTING TO GET ON

1015
00:29:30,402 --> 00:29:31,370
MY NERVES.

1016
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:33,572
SHE'S BECOMING A CONTROL FREAK.

1017
00:29:33,572 --> 00:29:35,174
AND THEN WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN,

1018
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:37,309
SHE DISAPPEARS, AND IT'S ALL ME

1019
00:29:37,309 --> 00:29:39,678
TAKING CARE OF SOPHIA.

1020
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:46,085
[Sophia crying]

1021
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:49,856
[softly] YOU'RE OKAY.

[Sophia crying]

1023
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:55,794
SOPHIA...

1024
00:30:05,137 --> 00:30:08,007
[softly] SO PRETTY.

1025
00:30:10,943 --> 00:30:14,981
[Sophia crying]

1026
00:30:16,182 --> 00:30:19,451
[Sophia crying]

1027
00:30:25,224 --> 00:30:27,193
SOPHIA KEPT ME UP ALL NIGHT,

1028
00:30:27,193 --> 00:30:29,195
AND I'M EXHAUSTED.

1029
00:30:31,597 --> 00:30:32,398
WELL, I KNOW THIS SOUNDS

1030
00:30:32,398 --> 00:30:33,599
A LITTLE BIT...

1031
00:30:33,599 --> 00:30:35,601
[laughs] NEEDY.

1032
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:39,738
BUT, LIKE, HOW MUCH WOULD YOU

1033
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:41,740
HELP A LITTLE BIT?

1034
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:43,442
>> "HELP A LITTLE BIT"?

1035
00:30:43,442 --> 00:30:44,210
>> WELL, HOW MUCH WOULD YOU,

1036
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:45,878
LIKE, IF I NEEDED SOMETHING

1037
00:30:45,878 --> 00:30:46,545
AT NIGHT...

1038
00:30:46,545 --> 00:30:47,746
[laughs]

1039
00:30:47,746 --> 00:30:49,648
>> PROBABLY NOT TOO MUCH.

1040
00:30:49,648 --> 00:30:50,917
>> NOT TOO MUCH.

1041
00:30:50,917 --> 00:30:54,086
YEAH.

1042
00:30:54,086 --> 00:30:56,188
>> NO, 'CAUSE I NEED MY SLEEP.

1043
00:30:56,188 --> 00:30:58,424
>> YEAH.

1044
00:30:58,424 --> 00:31:01,460
[chime dings]

1045
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,561
WHEN I THOUGHT ABOUT PULLING AN

1046
00:31:02,561 --> 00:31:04,463
ALL-NIGHTER FOR MY SENIOR YEAR,

1047
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:06,832
I WAS THINKING PARTIES, PROM,

1048
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:08,800
OR CRAMMING FOR FINALS.

1049
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,702
BUT NOW IT MEANS SOMETHING

1050
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,704
TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

1051
00:31:23,482 --> 00:31:25,151
>> I'M SPENDING MORE AND MORE

1052
00:31:25,151 --> 00:31:26,552
TIME HOME ALONE TAKING CARE OF

1053
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:28,520
SOPHIA, AND I'M STARTING TO GET

1054
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:29,621
MORE OF A HANDLE ON THIS WHOLE

1055
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:33,192
MOTHERING THING.

1056
00:31:33,192 --> 00:31:35,861
ALL RIGHTY TIGHTY.

1057
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:42,868
YOU'RE GONNA DOZE OFF.

1058
00:31:42,868 --> 00:31:43,702
MAYBE I SHOULD BURP YOU

1059
00:31:43,702 --> 00:31:46,072
ONE MORE TIME.

1060
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:48,740
TRAPPED IN THIS HOUSE WITHOUT

1061
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,076
A CAR, I'M STARTING TO GO

1062
00:31:50,076 --> 00:31:51,410
STIR-CRAZY.

1063
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,844
THANK GOD SOME OF MY FRIENDS

1070
00:31:58,951 --> 00:31:59,785
I DON'T HAVE A CAR RIGHT NOW

1071
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:01,187

00:32:05,224 --> 00:32:06,458
SEE FRIENDS, NO.

1078
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:07,759
I'M HOPING IT WILL ALL BE

1079
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:09,561
GOOD BY, LIKE, SIX MONTHS.

1080
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:10,997
[all laugh]

1081
00:32:10,997 --> 00:32:12,131
THAT'S AS LONG AS I'M GONNA HOLD

1082
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:13,365
OUT TILL.

1083
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:14,166
I'M GONNA HAVE A HARD TIME

1084
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:16,468
AFTER THAT.

1085
00:32:18,437 --> 00:32:19,972
IT WAS REALLY NICE TO SEE MY

1086
00:32:19,972 --> 00:32:21,240
FRIENDS, BUT WHEN THEY STARTED

1087
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,541
GETTING READY TO GO OUT,

1088
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:24,110
I REALIZED HOW MUCH MY LIFE

1089
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:25,011
HAS CHANGED.

1090
00:32:25,011 --> 00:32:25,711
>> ARE YOU READY

1091
00:32:25,711 --> 00:32:26,445
TO GO OUT, THOUGH?

1092
00:32:26,445 --> 00:32:27,313
I SERIOUSLY--

1093
00:32:27,313 --> 00:32:29,148
>> NO, I'M NOT READY TO GO OUT.

1094
00:32:29,148 --> 00:32:31,517
I'M GONNA CHILL AT HOME.

1095
00:32:31,517 --> 00:32:33,419
>> YOUR MOM COULD WATCH HER.

1096
00:32:33,419 --> 00:32:34,153
>> WELL, I--

1097
00:32:34,153 --> 00:32:35,354
>> JUST FOR, LIKE, TWO HOURS.

1098
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:36,122
>> YEAH.

YEAH, YOU'VE BEEN HOME ALL DAY.

1100
00:32:37,356 --> 00:32:38,157
JUST--

1101
00:32:38,157 --> 00:32:40,392
>> YEAH, NOW I WANT TO SLEEP.

1102
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:41,393
YOU GUYS CAN HAVE A FUN NIGHT

1103
00:32:41,393 --> 00:32:43,395
AND TELL ME HOW IT GOES.

1104
00:32:43,395 --> 00:32:44,663

LOOK AT CARS.

1131
00:33:25,871 --> 00:33:27,373
