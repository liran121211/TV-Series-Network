mom's relationship for granted

me and her got a lot closer

more of that time.

it's because of mom

the wedding a little bit?

194
00:08:02,793 --> 00:08:04,241
Yeah, I think in a way,

195

it's probably a good thing
that we're pushing back.

196

You know, not just
because of her mom

I have the IUD.

207
00:08:28,344 --> 00:08:29,551
IUD.

208
00:08:29,586 --> 00:08:31,827
Before I got pregnant,
I was on the pills.

209
00:08:31,862 --> 00:08:34,034
But I couldn't remember
to take them daily.

210
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:35,586
I'd go days without taking them.

211
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:37,827
So I figured, you know,
this is the best way

212
00:08:37,862 --> 00:08:40,551
and it'd give us a
little time period

213

It's hard to afford

So we definitely
can't afford another.

your teenage years?

he got to have his senior year

226
00:09:07,655 --> 00:09:10,931

a lot of my senior year.

227

mad at him because

really understand
where I'm coming from.

a minute away or something--

doesn't approve of that?

have jealousy issues.

her to marry you?

00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:03,103
"Hey, we've got the situation,
can you help us with this?

356
00:14:03,137 --> 00:14:04,586
What are our options?"

357
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,034
Yeah, they told him to
get a copy of his transcript

358
00:14:07,068 --> 00:14:10,000
whenever he got his final
grades for the semester.

359
00:14:10,034 --> 00:14:11,413
So he got those
transcripts together.

360
00:14:11,448 --> 00:14:12,241
No.

361
00:14:12,275 --> 00:14:13,137
He just never did it?

362
00:14:13,172 --> 00:14:14,000
Yeah.

363
00:14:15,034 --> 00:14:16,206
Don't know.

364
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:18,137
I gotta hear from him
when he gets out here.

365
00:14:18,172 --> 00:14:19,896
I guess so.

366
00:14:19,931 --> 00:14:21,724
How's relationship
with Isiah now?

367
00:14:22,724 --> 00:14:24,172
It's okay.

368
00:14:24,206 --> 00:14:25,275
Are there issues?

369
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,310
Yeah, there's a lot of 'em

370
00:14:27,344 --> 00:14:28,862
Alright, lets get him out here

371
00:14:28,896 --> 00:14:30,206
and talk about
these things, okay?

372
00:14:30,241 --> 00:14:31,241
Isiah, come on out.

373
00:14:32,482 --> 00:14:35,482
[audience clapping]

374
00:14:37,034 --> 00:14:37,896
How are you, sir?

375
00:14:37,931 --> 00:14:38,724
I'm good.

376
00:14:38,758 --> 00:14:39,965
How ya doing.

377
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,379
So she was saying
there's some issues.

378
00:14:41,413 --> 00:14:42,655
What's she talking about?

379
00:14:42,689 --> 00:14:45,758
I'd say there
were past issues.

380
00:14:45,793 --> 00:14:48,068
Like, present day, I don't
say there's any issues.

381
00:14:48,103 --> 00:14:49,827
That's from my
stand point though.

382
00:14:51,034 --> 00:14:52,275
And from your stand point?

383
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:55,137
I say the two main
problems would be,

384
00:14:55,172 --> 00:14:57,689
not necessarily
cheating, but mingling-

385
00:14:57,724 --> 00:14:58,517
[Dr. Drew] Mingling?

386
00:14:58,551 --> 00:14:59,344
Texting

387
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:00,724
Did you ever cheat?

388
00:15:00,758 --> 00:15:01,586
Mmm.

389
00:15:04,551 --> 00:15:05,724
Once.

390
00:15:08,103 --> 00:15:10,241
Not since we've
been married though.

391
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:11,241
Okay.

392
00:15:11,275 --> 00:15:12,655
So once you've made a commitment

393
00:15:12,689 --> 00:15:14,448
in front of God and
everybody you live up to it?

394
00:15:14,482 --> 00:15:18,000
No, I found out he cheated
on me after we got married.

395
00:15:19,344 --> 00:15:23,482
And, I think that's something
you should tell somebody

396
00:15:23,517 --> 00:15:25,137
before you marry them.

397
00:15:25,172 --> 00:15:26,137
How'd you find out?

398
00:15:26,172 --> 00:15:27,655
He was texting the girl again

399
00:15:27,689 --> 00:15:30,206
and I saw text messages
in Isiah's phone.

400
00:15:30,241 --> 00:15:31,620
And you couldn't
figure it out?

401
00:15:31,655 --> 00:15:33,241
Oh, I texted her.

402
00:15:33,275 --> 00:15:34,379
I hope she told you.

403
00:15:36,034 --> 00:15:37,413
I think Christinna's
living in the house

404
00:15:37,448 --> 00:15:40,620
where she doesn't feel
very supported by your kin.

405
00:15:40,655 --> 00:15:41,482
Yeah.

406
00:15:42,931 --> 00:15:45,482
My kin, them some tough
people to get along with.

407
00:15:45,517 --> 00:15:47,965
How do you feel about this
issue with the paternity test?

408
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,931
My grandma, I don't know,

409
00:15:49,965 --> 00:15:51,724
I let her think
whatever she wants to.

410
00:15:51,758 --> 00:15:53,137
[audience laughing]

411
00:15:53,172 --> 00:15:54,275
Did you ever question?

412
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,793
The paternity.

413
00:15:55,827 --> 00:15:57,827
I would say I did, when
she was first born though.

414
00:15:59,137 --> 00:16:00,448
Just what I would always think,

415
00:16:00,482 --> 00:16:01,862
like, "Wow she doesn't
really look like me."

416
00:16:01,896 --> 00:16:04,000
but now, like, months went by,

417
00:16:04,034 --> 00:16:08,000
like, wow she really looks
close to just like me now.

418
00:16:09,448 --> 00:16:12,068
Let me ask something,
just why not go back after

419
00:16:12,103 --> 00:16:14,103
the scholarships?

420
00:16:14,137 --> 00:16:15,724
I'm at a two-year
college right now

421
00:16:15,758 --> 00:16:18,000
so that gives us time for
our baby to get older,

422
00:16:18,034 --> 00:16:19,586
us to get our associate's and-

423
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:20,517
[Dr. Drew] You got some
work in the meantime.

424
00:16:20,551 --> 00:16:21,862
figure out a better plan.

425
00:16:22,862 --> 00:16:24,172
How did you get pregnant?

426
00:16:25,655 --> 00:16:27,620
Didn't you say you didn't
use any birth control or-

427
00:16:27,655 --> 00:16:28,758
Nothing.

428
00:16:28,793 --> 00:16:29,896
Isiah, you just-

429
00:16:29,931 --> 00:16:30,758
Nah.

430
00:16:32,137 --> 00:16:35,620
I don't know, me, high school,
I was the invincible kid.

431
00:16:35,655 --> 00:16:38,448
I was the football star,
the track star, the base-

432
00:16:38,482 --> 00:16:40,206
everybody liked me.

433
00:16:40,241 --> 00:16:41,724
Had just signed my scholarship,

434
00:16:41,758 --> 00:16:43,827
I didn't think I could
go wrong with anything.

435
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,310
What about now,
what are you doing?

436
00:16:46,344 --> 00:16:47,137
Nothing.

437
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:48,517
No contraceptives?

438
00:16:48,551 --> 00:16:49,551
Huh?

439
00:16:49,586 --> 00:16:52,103
[audience laughing]

440
00:16:52,137 --> 00:16:54,620
Well, you're keeping up
with the stats that way.

441
00:16:54,655 --> 00:16:57,137
About one in fourteen
moms get pregnant again

442
00:16:57,172 --> 00:16:58,413
within two years.

443
00:16:58,448 --> 00:17:00,206
So, do you want a second baby?

444
00:17:00,241 --> 00:17:01,724
Not now.

445
00:17:01,758 --> 00:17:02,827
Isiah, put a
condom on, you know.

446
00:17:02,862 --> 00:17:04,172
I know.

447
00:17:04,206 --> 00:17:05,413
[audience laughing]

448
00:17:05,448 --> 00:17:06,620
I'll go buy you some
when they do the break,

449
00:17:06,655 --> 00:17:07,655
I swear to God.

450
00:17:07,689 --> 00:17:09,620
[audience laughing]

451
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:12,862
The problem though is, If
you have a second child

452
00:17:12,896 --> 00:17:15,068
you're just gonna be scrambling
financially from then on.

453
00:17:15,103 --> 00:17:16,241
Yeah

454
00:17:16,275 --> 00:17:17,172
But imagine if another
child comes along,

455
00:17:17,206 --> 00:17:18,793
what that's gonna do to Destiny.

456
00:17:19,655 --> 00:17:20,482
It's not fair.

457
00:17:21,448 --> 00:17:22,344
No

458
00:17:22,379 --> 00:17:24,620
Okay, so contraception, yeah?

459
00:17:24,655 --> 00:17:26,965
Yeah. [laughs]

460
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,241
Isiah, Christinna, thank
you for sharing with us today.

461
00:17:29,275 --> 00:17:31,896
Now, bottom line, If
you're not using protection

462
00:17:31,931 --> 00:17:33,482
you can get pregnant.

463
00:17:33,517 --> 00:17:37,586
To learn more head over
to 16andpregnant.mtv.com.

464

We're gonna take a quick break

465
00:17:38,896 --> 00:17:40,620
and then I'll bring
out Brooke and Cody.

466
00:17:40,655 --> 00:17:43,000
Question here is, has car
racing taken a back seat

467
00:17:43,034 --> 00:17:44,896
to motherhood or vice versa?

468
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:46,206

Welcome back to the show.

472
00:18:03,172 --> 00:18:07,172
I am Dr. Drew and this the 16
and Pregnant Finale Special.

473
00:18:07,206 --> 00:18:09,068
Today's show is all
about the teen mothers

474
00:18:09,103 --> 00:18:11,275
but we'll make some room
for the guys as well

475
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:13,724
because we're gonna be chatting
with all the dads together

476
00:18:13,758 --> 00:18:15,827
on this stage, so
stay tuned for that.

477
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:17,241
I'm looking forward to that one.

478

Right now I'm joined by Brooke

Guys, how are ya?

481
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:22,724
Good.
Good.

482
00:18:22,758 --> 00:18:24,310
Now, you come
from a family where

483
00:18:24,344 --> 00:18:27,103
teen pregnancy has
not been that unusual.

484
00:18:27,137 --> 00:18:28,413
Not really.

485
00:18:28,448 --> 00:18:29,931
And you were gonna
break that cycle.

486
00:18:29,965 --> 00:18:31,620
Yeah, I thought I was.

487
00:18:31,655 --> 00:18:32,896
Supposed to.

488
00:18:32,931 --> 00:18:33,931
Okay, we'll talk
more about that

489
00:18:33,965 --> 00:18:35,241
but first, let's
take a look back

490
00:18:35,275 --> 00:18:38,206
at how Brooke handled
being 16 and pregnant.

491
00:18:39,517 --> 00:18:40,896
[Woman] Did you take one?

492
00:18:40,931 --> 00:18:41,827
Three.

493
00:18:41,862 --> 00:18:43,241
[Woman] Third time's a charm.

494
00:18:43,275 --> 00:18:46,724
No, all three of 'em
said the same thing.

495
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:48,931
Why do y'all wanna
get married right now?

496
00:18:48,965 --> 00:18:51,206
'Cause I don't wanna
be fat at my wedding.

497
00:18:51,241 --> 00:18:52,689
[Officiant] Do you,
Brooke, solemnly agree

498
00:18:52,724 --> 00:18:55,275
to receive this man as
your lawful wedded husband?

499
00:18:55,310 --> 00:18:56,517
I do.

500
00:18:56,551 --> 00:18:57,655
[Officiant] You
may kiss the bride.

501
00:18:59,758 --> 00:19:00,862
[Brooke] I love you.

502
00:19:00,896 --> 00:19:02,310
I love you too.

503
00:19:03,724 --> 00:19:05,034
Go daddy, go
daddy, go daddy, go!

504
00:19:05,068 --> 00:19:06,482
And y'all have
to pay for daycare,

505
00:19:06,517 --> 00:19:07,724
me and dad can't help you.

506
00:19:07,758 --> 00:19:09,517
We know, we have
to pay for daycare.

507
00:19:10,896 --> 00:19:12,586
One, two, three...

508
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,310
Come on sweetie, push!
Four, five.

509
00:19:14,344 --> 00:19:15,793
Come on, he's a long guy!

510
00:19:15,827 --> 00:19:16,793
Look at him!

511
00:19:19,517 --> 00:19:20,965
The house needs to be cleaned

512
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,448
and it's not happening.

513
00:19:22,482 --> 00:19:24,586
You guys gotta pick
up your slack, period.

514
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,137
We aren't putting
anything aside for

515
00:19:26,172 --> 00:19:30,137
paying back mom and dad
or the house or anything.

516
00:19:30,172 --> 00:19:31,827
So are we gonna change that now?

517
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:37,103
Oh goodness is right.

518
00:19:37,137 --> 00:19:38,758
Oh goodness.

519
00:19:38,793 --> 00:19:40,310
You're a junior in high
school, is that right?

520
00:19:40,344 --> 00:19:41,586
[Brooke] Mmhm.

521
00:19:41,620 --> 00:19:43,068
[Dr. Drew] Well that
must have been tough.

522
00:19:43,103 --> 00:19:45,724
I had a lot of support
from my friends and family

523
00:19:45,758 --> 00:19:50,034
so it wasn't as tough as
it is for most people.

524
00:19:50,068 --> 00:19:51,482
[Dr. Drew] Also you
had a supportive partner.

525
00:19:51,517 --> 00:19:52,931
[Brooke] Yes.

526
00:19:52,965 --> 00:19:54,344
Cody, you tried on a
pregnancy suit at one point,

527
00:19:54,379 --> 00:19:56,137
how'd that feel?

528
00:19:56,172 --> 00:19:59,068
Like, my back's killing
me, my legs are killing me.

529
00:19:59,103 --> 00:20:01,827
So then I had the bright idea of

530
00:20:01,862 --> 00:20:04,310
going out in public with it on

531
00:20:04,344 --> 00:20:07,655
and the looks I
got there was like

532
00:20:07,689 --> 00:20:08,517
what is he doing?

533
00:20:09,689 --> 00:20:14,241
But, I mean it's, it's
more understanding now

534
00:20:14,275 --> 00:20:16,034
to know what she went through

535
00:20:16,068 --> 00:20:20,068
and I think that should be
something every guy tries on.

536
00:20:20,103 --> 00:20:21,379
Brooke, is it emotional to see

537
00:20:21,413 --> 00:20:22,965
all of the other
moms' stories too?

538
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,034
Yeah, 'cause it's sad
when they don't have

539
00:20:25,068 --> 00:20:27,275
the support that they
need to get through it.

540
00:20:28,448 --> 00:20:30,448
There's no way I could
do it without him

541
00:20:30,482 --> 00:20:33,655
or my parents or his
grandparents or his parents.

542
00:20:35,206 --> 00:20:37,724
My understanding
is that you're pretty
connected to Brody,

543
00:20:37,758 --> 00:20:39,344
you're with him all the time.

544
00:20:39,379 --> 00:20:40,965
You went to prom?

545
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:44,103
That was the first
time I left him.

546
00:20:44,137 --> 00:20:49,137
It was sad but it was good
for me to start to know that

547
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:51,448
I have to leave him
every once in a while.

548
00:20:51,482 --> 00:20:52,896
And you're starting
to get used to

549
00:20:52,931 --> 00:20:54,896
handing him over to people?

550
00:20:54,931 --> 00:20:56,137
I didn't think it
would be this hard

551
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,724
to leave him every
once in a while.

552
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,034
I mean, did you decide,

553
00:21:00,068 --> 00:21:01,517
oh, I'll just keep
going to school?

554
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,724
I think that's what you
said even in your segment

555
00:21:02,758 --> 00:21:04,000
was just, I'll go to
school, I'll get a job,

556
00:21:04,034 --> 00:21:05,517
I'll do all these things.

557
00:21:05,551 --> 00:21:08,206
And I'm going to school and
I start my job in the summer.

558
00:21:08,241 --> 00:21:11,793
But it's gonna be hard,
it's gonna be really hard.

559
00:21:12,965 --> 00:21:14,896
You come from a
long heritage of

560
00:21:14,931 --> 00:21:17,310
women that got married
young and teen moms.

561
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:21,344
For Brody, do you expect
he'll be a teen dad?

562
00:21:21,379 --> 00:21:24,517
I hope not, I'm gonna
teach him what I can, but.

563
00:21:24,551 --> 00:21:26,034
Did your mom talk to
you about those things?

564
00:21:26,068 --> 00:21:27,172
Yeah.

565
00:21:27,206 --> 00:21:30,000
I didn't listen. [laughs]

566
00:21:30,034 --> 00:21:31,896
How tough for mom,
she's trying to tell
you all this stuff

567
00:21:31,931 --> 00:21:33,344
and what, you run
out of the room?

568
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:35,379
It's awkward to me, I
don't know why, it just is.

569
00:21:35,413 --> 00:21:36,655
It's a difficult topic.

570
00:21:36,689 --> 00:21:37,655
Yeah.

571
00:21:37,689 --> 00:21:38,862
Well guys, thanks for joining

572
00:21:38,896 --> 00:21:40,241
and thanks for
sharing the story.

573
00:21:40,275 --> 00:21:41,068
Thank you.

574
00:21:41,103 --> 00:21:42,689
Our next mom is Megan,

575
00:21:42,724 --> 00:21:44,034
here is what she went through

576
00:21:44,068 --> 00:21:45,620
this season on 16 and Pregnant.

577
00:21:48,241 --> 00:21:49,068
Yeah, I'm not ready.

578
00:21:50,206 --> 00:21:51,103
You will be.

579
00:21:51,137 --> 00:21:52,655
It's heartbreaking.

580
00:21:52,689 --> 00:21:54,620
You know, you guys
can't be kids anymore.

581
00:21:54,655 --> 00:21:56,034
You and this stupid game.

582
00:21:56,068 --> 00:21:57,517
[Nathan] I have
nothing better to do.

583
00:21:57,551 --> 00:21:59,068
It's not gonna be easy
to take care of a baby

584
00:21:59,103 --> 00:22:01,206
with a controller in your hand.

585
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:02,482
I think once the baby comes

586
00:22:02,517 --> 00:22:03,655
and things start getting rough,

587
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:04,931
Nathan's gonna split.

588
00:22:04,965 --> 00:22:07,241
So you realize if we
weren't having a baby,

589
00:22:07,275 --> 00:22:08,586
I wouldn't be here, right?

590
00:22:10,034 --> 00:22:11,241
You're doing amazing,
baby, look at that.

591
00:22:11,275 --> 00:22:13,655
Meghan, you were
right, he's perfect.

592
00:22:13,689 --> 00:22:15,068
[Woman] Good job, Megan!

593
00:22:15,103 --> 00:22:19,586
I realize that I
was stupid, I'm sorry.

594
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,344
[Meghan] It's okay.

595
00:22:22,551 --> 00:22:23,655
[Meghan] 'Kay.

596
00:22:23,689 --> 00:22:24,965
Now that we're parents,
we kinda need to

597
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,310
change our priorities
a little bit more.

598
00:22:27,344 --> 00:22:29,241
What the hell do
you want me to do?

599
00:22:29,275 --> 00:22:31,206
[Megan] You need to
lay off the video games

600
00:22:31,241 --> 00:22:32,551
and change more diapers.

601
00:22:32,586 --> 00:22:34,241
Your living off
my dad's paycheck

602
00:22:34,275 --> 00:22:35,896
doesn't really thrill me.

603
00:22:35,931 --> 00:22:38,448
You can stop glaring at
me at any point in time.

604
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,517
I would like if you got a job.

605
00:22:40,551 --> 00:22:41,965
I can go to Texas and work.

606
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,482
I don't want you
to go to Texas.

607
00:22:43,517 --> 00:22:46,310
It's kinda hard to begin
our life without any money.

608
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,620
Very stressful, right?

609
00:22:52,758 --> 00:22:57,034
80% of teen moms'
baby daddies take off.

610
00:22:57,068 --> 00:22:58,448
Where's Nathan?

611
00:22:58,482 --> 00:22:59,965
He's at home.

612
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,586
Why isn't he here?

613
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:06,275
'Cause we've been having
problems and stuff, so.

614
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,758
He should be here
supporting you, right?

615
00:23:07,793 --> 00:23:08,620
Yeah.

616
00:23:09,586 --> 00:23:10,724
You live with your mom now?

617
00:23:10,758 --> 00:23:11,931
Mmhm.

618
00:23:11,965 --> 00:23:14,000
And he was living with
your mom too, right?

619
00:23:14,034 --> 00:23:14,965
Where's he living now?

620
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,103
His grandma's.

621
00:23:16,137 --> 00:23:17,724
[Dr. Drew] So he's taken off?

622
00:23:17,758 --> 00:23:18,827
Yeah.

623
00:23:18,862 --> 00:23:20,413
Tell us what's going on.

624
00:23:20,448 --> 00:23:24,655
Well, we were
engaged but he said,

625
00:23:24,689 --> 00:23:27,620
last week he said he
didn't know what he wanted

626
00:23:27,655 --> 00:23:31,448
so we kind of broke up, I think,

627
00:23:31,482 --> 00:23:33,103
we haven't made it
like official though,

628
00:23:33,137 --> 00:23:34,793
and he moved out,

629
00:23:34,827 --> 00:23:38,344
but he still comes by like
every day to see the baby.

630
00:23:38,379 --> 00:23:41,034
Did you expect the baby to
kinda keep him in the game?

631
00:23:41,931 --> 00:23:43,379
Kind of.

632
00:23:43,413 --> 00:23:46,310
Yeah, eight out of 10
times it makes 'em split.

633
00:23:46,344 --> 00:23:48,172
[laughs]

634
00:23:48,206 --> 00:23:50,482
I bet a lot of people
complain about Nathan.

635
00:23:50,517 --> 00:23:52,000
Yeah.

636
00:23:52,034 --> 00:23:53,758
And I bet you have to
come to his defense a lot.

637
00:23:55,827 --> 00:23:58,068
Why do you think that is?

638
00:23:59,586 --> 00:24:01,482
Because I don't
want it to be true.

639
00:24:02,793 --> 00:24:05,103
I think that's very honest.

640
00:24:06,379 --> 00:24:08,965
What is it you
don't want to be true?

641
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,275
Like, him not
wanting to be around.

642
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,586
How is it trying
to raise a baby

643
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,137
without a dad around?

644
00:24:15,172 --> 00:24:19,862
I've basically been doing all
of it since he was born, so.

645
00:24:19,896 --> 00:24:21,068
[Dr. Drew] It's the same?

646
00:24:24,517 --> 00:24:25,931
It just sucks.

647
00:24:27,586 --> 00:24:29,517
It sucks being,
doing it alone?

648
00:24:36,103 --> 00:24:37,206
But you have your mom.

649
00:24:43,034 --> 00:24:45,862
I am so sorry he's letting
you down like this,

650
00:24:45,896 --> 00:24:47,034
you don't deserve that.

651
00:24:50,137 --> 00:24:52,068
Is there something
particularly difficult now

652
00:24:52,103 --> 00:24:54,206
about the caretaking alone?

653
00:24:54,241 --> 00:24:57,137
Yeah, just like,
not having him there

654
00:24:57,172 --> 00:24:58,689
to just even like talk to me

655
00:24:58,724 --> 00:25:01,068
while I'm having
problems with Blake, and.

656
00:25:01,103 --> 00:25:03,034
So just the
supportive presence?

657
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:06,448
I'm still a little unclear, so
things are going along okay,

658
00:25:06,482 --> 00:25:08,000
a little too much video games,

659
00:25:08,034 --> 00:25:10,482
and then he just leaves?

660
00:25:10,517 --> 00:25:11,310
Yeah.

661
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:12,137
No warning?

662
00:25:12,172 --> 00:25:13,344
Mm-mm.

663
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:15,482
Like we didn't even have
a fight or anything.

664
00:25:15,517 --> 00:25:18,448
He just said he didn't think
he wanted to get married

665
00:25:18,482 --> 00:25:21,000
and he didn't know whether
he wanted to be with me.

666
00:25:22,206 --> 00:25:23,551
You got a little
explaining to do,

667
00:25:23,586 --> 00:25:25,655
I mean, right?

668
00:25:25,689 --> 00:25:26,517
Yeah.

669
00:25:29,482 --> 00:25:32,413
All right Megan, well
thank you for coming today,

670
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:33,655
I appreciate you sharing.

671
00:25:35,206 --> 00:25:36,034
Yeah.

672
00:25:37,137 --> 00:25:39,068
The emotional
reunion, don't forget,

673
00:25:39,103 --> 00:25:41,482
between Ashley and baby Callie

674
00:25:41,517 --> 00:25:44,724
and Callie's adoptive
parents is still on the way,

675
00:25:44,758 --> 00:25:47,862
and up next is Felicia.

676
00:25:47,896 --> 00:25:51,413
Her mom and her baby's father
didn't always see eye to eye

677
00:25:51,448 --> 00:25:53,103
and they're both here.

678
00:25:53,137 --> 00:25:56,103
So we'll see where things stand
with them after the break,

679
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,620
do not move.

680
00:25:57,655 --> 00:26:06,137
[audience applauds]

681
00:26:06,172 --> 00:26:08,551
[audience applauds]

682
00:26:08,586 --> 00:26:11,586
[audience applause]

683
00:26:12,793 --> 00:26:15,034
Welcome back to
life after labor.

684
00:26:15,068 --> 00:26:17,551
I'm Doctor Drew and
here's a disturbing fact.

685
00:26:17,586 --> 00:26:21,413
Less than 2%, that's
2%, of teen mothers

686
00:26:21,448 --> 00:26:24,103
graduate from college
by the age of 30.

687
00:26:24,137 --> 00:26:27,068
One teen mom who hopes to
beat those odds is Felicia.

688
00:26:27,103 --> 00:26:28,482
Hi Felicia.

689
00:26:28,517 --> 00:26:31,068
Your mom was always on
you about graduating.

690
00:26:31,103 --> 00:26:32,034
Did you do it?

691
00:26:32,068 --> 00:26:33,620
I went to night school,

692
00:26:33,655 --> 00:26:35,827
so I got a lot of
classes done faster.

693
00:26:35,862 --> 00:26:40,551
So I'm graduating a year earlier
than I was supposed to be.

694
00:26:40,586 --> 00:26:42,655
All righty, well here
is Felicia's journey

695
00:26:42,689 --> 00:26:43,758
on 16 and Pregnant.

696
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:47,724
I just handed the
pregnancy test to her.

697
00:26:47,758 --> 00:26:49,172
She's like, "So
you're not pregnant?"

698
00:26:49,206 --> 00:26:52,793
I was like, "No mom,
it says I'm pregnant."

699
00:26:52,827 --> 00:26:54,689
[Alex] Do you remember
when we first met?

700
00:26:54,724 --> 00:26:55,965
Yeah, do you?

701
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,206
You used to be such a
little goody goody girl.

702
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:58,655
You have to graduate.

703
00:26:58,689 --> 00:27:00,310
You were the only
one who promised me

704
00:27:00,344 --> 00:27:01,655
that you was going to graduate.

705
00:27:01,689 --> 00:27:03,206
That's always been my goal.

706
00:27:03,241 --> 00:27:05,724
Alex, he tells me,
I'm coming home early.

707
00:27:05,758 --> 00:27:07,965
He doesn't get home til
like 2:30 in the morning.

708
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,413
Yeah that's messed up.

709
00:27:09,448 --> 00:27:11,034
So after she's born are
you still gonna be going out?

710
00:27:11,068 --> 00:27:12,689
I can't really answer that.

711
00:27:12,724 --> 00:27:14,862
It's just not the same anymore.

712
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,000
[Female] Good job.

713
00:27:19,551 --> 00:27:20,965
Oh Felicia.

714

[Operator] Your call
has been forwarded

716
00:27:28,862 --> 00:27:30,896
He needs to hurry
up and come home.

717
00:27:30,931 --> 00:27:33,448
I just wish I should have
waited just a little more.

718
00:27:33,482 --> 00:27:35,413
You're not happy are you?

719
00:27:35,448 --> 00:27:36,620
No.

720
00:27:36,655 --> 00:27:38,586
Now that I have Genesis,
I could care less

721
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,862
if you're with me, but
this is your daughter.

722
00:27:40,896 --> 00:27:43,448
I could care less if I'm
with you too, honestly.

723
00:27:47,724 --> 00:27:49,172
Uh-oh.

724
00:27:49,206 --> 00:27:51,965
I haven't even spoken to you
yet and you're already crying.

725
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,413
What are you crying about?

726
00:27:54,448 --> 00:27:56,379
I don't know, it's
just hard watching that.

727
00:27:56,413 --> 00:27:57,310
[Dr. Drew] Yeah.

728
00:27:57,344 --> 00:27:58,931
Just the things he said,

729
00:27:58,965 --> 00:28:01,034
how he could care less
if he was with me.

730
00:28:02,241 --> 00:28:03,931
Did you at one
time imagine the baby

731
00:28:03,965 --> 00:28:06,724
was gonna solve these
relationship problems?

732
00:28:06,758 --> 00:28:08,827
I thought maybe we
would come closer.

733
00:28:08,862 --> 00:28:10,965
That isn't usually
what happens.

734
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,724
You still have friends?

735
00:28:12,758 --> 00:28:16,034
I wouldn't say I
have true friends.

736
00:28:16,068 --> 00:28:17,482
[Dr. Drew] Why's that?

737
00:28:19,137 --> 00:28:21,448
I lost a lot when
I got pregnant.

738
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:25,758
[Dr. Drew] They just
fell by the wayside?

739
00:28:25,793 --> 00:28:28,551
I just didn't really have
any support from my friends.

740
00:28:28,586 --> 00:28:29,827
Were they just not
supportive the way

741
00:28:29,862 --> 00:28:31,482
you needed them
to be supportive?

742
00:28:35,931 --> 00:28:38,034
I know your mom's
got a lot to say,

743
00:28:38,068 --> 00:28:39,482
and it seems like
she's been a very

744
00:28:39,517 --> 00:28:41,413
supportive parent
throughout your pregnancy,

745
00:28:41,448 --> 00:28:43,586
even though it's
freaked her out a bit.

746
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:46,000
And then seems like Alex
is stepping it up a bit,

747
00:28:46,034 --> 00:28:47,000
he is not?

748
00:28:47,034 --> 00:28:48,172
Mm.

749
00:28:48,206 --> 00:28:49,482
Although he said
some horrible things.

750
00:28:49,517 --> 00:28:50,413
[Felicia] Yeah.

751
00:28:50,448 --> 00:28:51,965
Let's get them both out here

752
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,448
and discuss this a
little further, okay?

753
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:55,103
Alex and Reina, come on out.

756
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:02,172
Good.

757
00:29:02,206 --> 00:29:03,482
What are you thinking?

758
00:29:03,517 --> 00:29:06,931
I think she really
disappointed me.

759
00:29:06,965 --> 00:29:08,482
How old were you
when you got pregnant?

760
00:29:08,517 --> 00:29:09,931
I was 16.

761
00:29:09,965 --> 00:29:11,482
Was your mom mad?

762
00:29:11,517 --> 00:29:12,758
No, she threw me out.

763
00:29:12,793 --> 00:29:13,896
She said, "Get outta here."

764
00:29:13,931 --> 00:29:15,000
[Dr. Drew] She was really mad?

765
00:29:15,034 --> 00:29:16,482
Yeah she was mad.

766
00:29:16,517 --> 00:29:17,275
[Dr. Drew] Same
anger you have.

767
00:29:17,310 --> 00:29:18,517
Same, yeah.

768
00:29:18,551 --> 00:29:20,482
How does it feel
to hear that you

769
00:29:20,517 --> 00:29:22,586
disappointed your mom so much?

770
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:24,206
I didn't wanna disappoint you.

771
00:29:34,586 --> 00:29:35,689
Alex, what are you feeling?

772
00:29:35,724 --> 00:29:37,000
I don't know.

773
00:29:39,793 --> 00:29:41,896
Mom and Felicia, would
you switch positions

774
00:29:41,931 --> 00:29:42,931
for a second, please?

775
00:29:44,689 --> 00:29:48,137
I'm doing that because I
want Alex next to Felicia.

776
00:29:48,172 --> 00:29:51,103
What's the status of your
relationship right now?

777
00:29:51,137 --> 00:29:52,034
Just together.

778
00:29:52,068 --> 00:29:53,379
[Dr. Drew] Just together.

779
00:29:53,413 --> 00:29:54,965
Is there any talk
about marriage?

780
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Uh yeah, but I don't
wanna get married.

781
00:29:59,034 --> 00:30:01,206
I don't really wanna
get married right now.

see how it goes.

784
00:30:04,103 --> 00:30:06,275
I mean we have some
issues right now, so.

785
00:30:07,482 --> 00:30:09,413
What does he need to
do to get to the point

786
00:30:09,448 --> 00:30:11,275
where you would trust
him as a husband?

787
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:16,931
Show me that he
cares more about me.

788
00:30:16,965 --> 00:30:18,137
I do show you that I care.

789
00:30:18,172 --> 00:30:20,551
Every morning I go
to work, come back,

790
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:23,586
you know, I'm taking
care of you and Genesis.

791
00:30:23,620 --> 00:30:25,103
You can't say that I didn't.

792
00:30:25,137 --> 00:30:26,655
I started taking
care of you even

793
00:30:26,689 --> 00:30:28,310
way before you had Genesis.

794
00:30:28,344 --> 00:30:30,068
You came from a
broken family too.

795
00:30:30,103 --> 00:30:32,310
Yes, my momma
raised me by herself.

796
00:30:32,344 --> 00:30:35,586
I mean I've been through
so much since I was little.

797

show me any love.

It's just not easy.

Do you understand
what he's saying?

806
00:31:01,517 --> 00:31:03,034
You got a mom
that you can go to,

807
00:31:03,068 --> 00:31:04,172
I don't got nobody.

808
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,724
And you got your step-dad.

809
00:31:08,758 --> 00:31:11,758
You know I've been standing
by myself since I was 15.

810
00:31:11,793 --> 00:31:14,827
I decided to do my own life
so that's what I'm doing.

815
00:31:25,586 --> 00:31:26,862
I mean you need to be a unit,

816
00:31:26,896 --> 00:31:28,758

move out in a little bit,

Oh I'm renting my
house so they can move

826
00:31:46,758 --> 00:31:48,068
and they have their own life.

827
00:31:48,103 --> 00:31:49,655

still be in the...

there are things we can do

00:39:38,758 --> 00:39:40,931
of everything you need to
get started in prospecting.

1059
00:39:40,965 --> 00:39:42,206
This will make you money.

1060
00:39:43,413 --> 00:39:44,793
You know I thought
we would definitely

1061
00:39:44,827 --> 00:39:46,793
be out of mema's house by now.

1062
00:39:46,827 --> 00:39:48,586
Yeah, me too.
So I got the job.

1063
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,344
Are you excited?

1064
00:39:50,379 --> 00:39:52,413
I'd be so nice to
have the extra money.

1065
00:39:55,275 --> 00:39:57,000
So you're out of
mema's house yet?

1066
00:39:57,034 --> 00:39:58,448
No.

1067
00:39:58,482 --> 00:39:59,896
And Brandon, you pretty
clearly wanted Aubrey

1068
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:01,137
to be a stay-at-home mom,

1069
00:40:01,172 --> 00:40:03,034
but that doesn't sound
like what her plan is.

1070
00:40:03,068 --> 00:40:05,310
Initially, my thought
it always goes to daycare,

1071
00:40:05,344 --> 00:40:07,965
because I know childcare
is very expensive.

1072
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,655
And would it really
be cost-effective to,

1073
00:40:10,689 --> 00:40:13,448
for her to work and then
you know her what she make

1074
00:40:13,482 --> 00:40:15,000
might not even be
what it's gonna cost

1075
00:40:15,034 --> 00:40:16,551
to have him in daycare.

1076
00:40:17,758 --> 00:40:19,896
What about her being
able to feel productive

1077
00:40:19,931 --> 00:40:21,448
and good about her life?

1078
00:40:21,482 --> 00:40:23,551
Well, that's kind of what we
came to a compromise on that.

1079
00:40:23,586 --> 00:40:24,827
Good.

1080
00:40:24,862 --> 00:40:26,379
Who was there for Aubrey
in the delivery room?

1081
00:40:27,551 --> 00:40:30,310
Actually I just
had Brandon in there.

1082
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:31,620
[Dr. Drew] That was it?

1083
00:40:31,655 --> 00:40:33,068
Your mom didn't
want to be there?

1084
00:40:33,103 --> 00:40:35,413
When I was giving birth I
didn't want anybody in the room.

1085
00:40:35,448 --> 00:40:37,379
[Dr. Drew] How about your
family, did they show up?

1086
00:40:37,413 --> 00:40:39,413
Well, no, not right away,

1087
00:40:39,448 --> 00:40:42,758
just because really the one
I'm the closest to is my dad,

1088
00:40:42,793 --> 00:40:43,965
and he just didn't
have the finances

1089
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,344
at that point to come down.

1090
00:40:45,379 --> 00:40:46,758
Where's your mom?

1091
00:40:46,793 --> 00:40:47,620
She's away.

1092
00:40:49,068 --> 00:40:50,379
Yeah.

1093
00:40:50,413 --> 00:40:52,862
I've stayed pretty
disconnected since she left.

1094
00:40:54,068 --> 00:40:55,551
How old were you
when she took off?

1095
00:40:56,517 --> 00:41:00,275
I think like six or seven.

1096
00:41:01,689 --> 00:41:03,241
So you've not really
had females in your life?

1097
00:41:03,275 --> 00:41:05,379
Not really any positive ones.

1098
00:41:05,413 --> 00:41:08,620
I've always gotten along
better with women than men.

1099
00:41:08,655 --> 00:41:10,413
Have you had
girlfriends before Aubrey?

1100
00:41:10,448 --> 00:41:11,689
One.

1101
00:41:11,724 --> 00:41:12,862
[Dr. Drew] Did that end okay?

1102
00:41:12,896 --> 00:41:14,103
No.

1103
00:41:14,137 --> 00:41:16,482
Excuse my language,
she's a dumb [beep].

1104
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:18,068
Sorry.

1105
00:41:18,103 --> 00:41:20,034
Aubrey, how do you
really feel about her?

1106
00:41:20,068 --> 00:41:22,137
[laughs]

1107
00:41:24,379 --> 00:41:26,310
How's the panning
for gold going?

1108
00:41:26,344 --> 00:41:28,172
Awesome, we are rich.

1109
00:41:28,206 --> 00:41:31,724
I've got a mansion in
the Hamptons, it's great.

1110
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,344
And, what are we doing
to prevent another baby?

1111
00:41:36,379 --> 00:41:39,620
Now my understanding
is you used to use

1112
00:41:39,655 --> 00:41:41,241
the pull-out method?

1113
00:41:41,275 --> 00:41:43,379
Yes, we did.

1114
00:41:43,413 --> 00:41:44,586
It works terribly.

1115
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:46,551
[Dr. Drew] Yeah,
don't do that.

1116
00:41:46,586 --> 00:41:48,172
What are you doing now?

1117
00:41:48,206 --> 00:41:50,689
I got the non-hormonal IUD.

1118
00:41:50,724 --> 00:41:51,965
Good.

1119
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,586
Did you have any kind
of health sex classes

1120
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,137
in your high school,

1121
00:41:55,172 --> 00:41:56,379
health education?
We did.

1122
00:41:56,413 --> 00:41:58,448
They went over the
thought of you know

1123
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:00,965
you can get pregnant if you
don't use birth control,

1124
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,551
but they didn't go
over all my options.

1125
00:42:04,448 --> 00:42:05,586
They didn't talk about

1126
00:42:05,620 --> 00:42:07,103
all the different
kinds of contraception.

1127
00:42:07,137 --> 00:42:08,931
If somebody had discussed
this with you ahead of time,

1128
00:42:08,965 --> 00:42:11,413
do you think you would
have gotten pregnant?

1129
00:42:11,448 --> 00:42:13,724
I probably would have
already been on the IUD.

1130
00:42:13,758 --> 00:42:15,965
I probably honestly
would have been.

1131
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,482
Thank you, it's an
important point to make.

1132
00:42:17,517 --> 00:42:18,862
Thank you for
making that, Aubrey.

1133
00:42:18,896 --> 00:42:20,896
For more information
on prevention,

1134
00:42:20,931 --> 00:42:24,413
go to 16andPregnant.mtv.com.

1135
00:42:24,448 --> 00:42:25,896
Educate yourself.

1136
00:42:25,931 --> 00:42:27,655
Thank you guys for
being here again.

1137
00:42:27,689 --> 00:42:29,827
Let's move right on
now to our next mom.

1138
00:42:29,862 --> 00:42:33,068
It's time to revisit Emily's
story on 16 and Pregnant.

1139
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:38,689
I'm living my whole high
school life in one year

1140
00:42:38,724 --> 00:42:40,793
and I'm pregnant
and having a baby.

1141
00:42:40,827 --> 00:42:42,448
I don't want no baby.

1142
00:42:42,482 --> 00:42:44,620
I mean I do now I guess but.

1143
00:42:44,655 --> 00:42:45,758
Do you feel like
you're mature enough

1144
00:42:45,793 --> 00:42:48,000
to have made the
decision to have a baby?

1145
00:42:48,034 --> 00:42:48,862
I guess.

1146
00:42:50,275 --> 00:42:53,275
Board of Education states
failure due to attendance.

1147
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:55,241
Little lucky 'cause
she's pregnant.

1148
00:42:55,275 --> 00:42:56,931
It really doesn't matter
what you think though.

1149
00:42:56,965 --> 00:42:59,034
I can keep her from
even marrying you, pal.

1150
00:42:59,068 --> 00:43:01,241
Push, push,
push, there you go.

1151
00:43:01,275 --> 00:43:02,275
Oh my god.

1152
00:43:03,862 --> 00:43:05,310
So what's been going
on with you and Daniel?

1153
00:43:05,344 --> 00:43:07,758
He feels bad about saying
he's gonna like come over

1154
00:43:07,793 --> 00:43:09,413
and then like not coming over.

1155
00:43:09,448 --> 00:43:11,758
You think being this far
away is gonna be a big deal?

1156
00:43:11,793 --> 00:43:15,034
Daniel's gonna be
missing major things.

1157
00:43:15,068 --> 00:43:17,137
I've drive like almost
an hour to come see you.

1158
00:43:17,172 --> 00:43:18,068
If you think that you're not

1159
00:43:18,103 --> 00:43:19,827
going to get along with him now,

1160
00:43:19,862 --> 00:43:22,724
what's gonna change when you
move off and live together?

1161
00:43:22,758 --> 00:43:25,448
I don't think we took enough
time to look at everything.

1162
00:43:25,482 --> 00:43:28,275
I guess I realized that
I have that options.

1163
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:29,931
I guess that don't include me.

1164
00:43:35,068 --> 00:43:36,000
[Dr. Drew] A lot
of your dad in that.

1165
00:43:36,034 --> 00:43:37,448
Yes.

1166
00:43:37,482 --> 00:43:38,655
It's a good thing you've
got your dad up there, right?

1167
00:43:38,689 --> 00:43:40,034
Mm-hmm.

1168
00:43:40,068 --> 00:43:42,758
What's the status of
relationship with Daniel now?

1169
00:43:42,793 --> 00:43:45,655
I mean everything's
gotten a lot better.

1170
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:46,827
Since what we just saw?

1171
00:43:46,862 --> 00:43:48,034
Yes, yes, definitely.

1172
00:43:48,068 --> 00:43:48,862
You're better.

1173
00:43:48,896 --> 00:43:49,689
Are you engaged?

1174
00:43:49,724 --> 00:43:51,103
Yes.

1175
00:43:51,137 --> 00:43:52,586
Did I see you sort of putting
off the marriage is that--

1176
00:43:52,620 --> 00:43:54,793
Yeah, but we haven't broken
up or anything like that.

1177
00:43:54,827 --> 00:43:56,448
It seems like
your dad and Daniel

1178
00:43:56,482 --> 00:43:58,241
have come a long way
in their relationship.

1179
00:43:58,275 --> 00:43:59,310
How they get along now?

1180
00:43:59,344 --> 00:44:00,655
They get along good.

1181
00:44:00,689 --> 00:44:01,793
So that's improved?

1182
00:44:01,827 --> 00:44:03,275
Yes.
Why don't we bring them out

1183
00:44:03,310 --> 00:44:04,172
and see how they're
doing right now.

1184
00:44:04,206 --> 00:44:05,862
Alrighty.

1185
00:44:05,896 --> 00:44:09,034
[audience applauding]

1186
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:14,103
Hi there.

1187
00:44:14,137 --> 00:44:14,965
Gentlemen, welcome.

1188
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:15,793
How are you guys?

1189
00:44:15,827 --> 00:44:17,206
Fine.

1190
00:44:17,241 --> 00:44:19,551
Stacey, from your
standpoint, things better?

1191
00:44:19,586 --> 00:44:21,241
Yes sir, getting a lot better.

1192
00:44:21,275 --> 00:44:23,620
You were very skeptical
for a while there.

1193
00:44:23,655 --> 00:44:25,034
Still am.

1194
00:44:25,068 --> 00:44:27,068
Emily was a great
student right, a majorette.

1195
00:44:27,103 --> 00:44:27,965
What happened?

1196
00:44:29,103 --> 00:44:30,758
I would like to
though that myself.

1197
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:33,034
Daniel, you smiled when
I asked that question.

1198
00:44:33,068 --> 00:44:35,758
Oh I mean I know
she was really smart,

1199
00:44:35,793 --> 00:44:36,931
she still is really smart.

1200
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:40,344
I mean she did really
good in school.

1201
00:44:40,379 --> 00:44:42,931
I hate that she had
to go to home school

1202
00:44:42,965 --> 00:44:45,655
and not be able to finish
out at regular high school.

1203
00:44:45,689 --> 00:44:46,931
Where are you living now?

1204
00:44:46,965 --> 00:44:48,137
At my house.

1205
00:44:48,172 --> 00:44:49,413
How far is that
from where Emily is?

1206
00:44:49,448 --> 00:44:50,448
Like 45 miles.

1207
00:44:50,482 --> 00:44:51,586
45 miles.

1208
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:53,793
And so when do you see them?

1209
00:44:53,827 --> 00:44:55,275
Every day that I don't work.

1210
00:44:55,310 --> 00:44:56,551
Like two or
three times a week.

1211
00:44:56,586 --> 00:44:58,034
[Dr. Drew] Two or
three times a week.

1212
00:44:58,068 --> 00:44:59,620
But not on the weekend.
Is that plan working?

1213
00:44:59,655 --> 00:45:02,068
Yeah, it sucks, but that's
what we have to deal with.

1214
00:45:02,103 --> 00:45:04,448
It's just amazes me how

1215
00:45:04,482 --> 00:45:06,620
everything can be
tooken so lightly.

1216
00:45:06,655 --> 00:45:08,068
So you think she
should marry Daniel?

1217
00:45:08,103 --> 00:45:11,068
I think that it would
have been a great you know--

1218
00:45:11,103 --> 00:45:12,034
Good move?

1219
00:45:12,068 --> 00:45:12,862
Yeah.

1220
00:45:12,896 --> 00:45:14,482
Step up, do it.

1221
00:45:14,517 --> 00:45:16,068
And then you think he'd
step up a little further

1222
00:45:16,103 --> 00:45:17,034
if he were the husband.

1223
00:45:17,068 --> 00:45:18,517
He'd have to.

1224
00:45:18,551 --> 00:45:20,413
I don't think it's real
until we live together,

1225
00:45:20,448 --> 00:45:23,172
and I think that's what's
gonna be the problem,

1226
00:45:23,206 --> 00:45:24,689
is when we finally
move in together

1227
00:45:24,724 --> 00:45:26,896
and have to pay our own
bills and our insurance--

1228
00:45:26,931 --> 00:45:29,758
Yeah, that's gonna be
a whole different thing.

school and my friends

1237

1238
00:45:47,137 --> 00:45:49,724
and then college
and stuff like that

1239

like everybody else

living with your mom

1247

[Emily] Yes.

1249
00:46:04,758 --> 00:46:06,000
How was your relationship
with your mom at that point

1250
00:46:06,034 --> 00:46:07,241

1252

negative relationship.

1254
00:46:11,758 --> 00:46:13,620
I mean she just never gave
me the freedom that I wanted.

1255
00:46:13,655 --> 00:46:16,793
And then when I started
like dating or liking him,

1256
00:46:16,827 --> 00:46:19,379
she just hated him like
from the start immediately

1257
00:46:19,413 --> 00:46:23,000
and I liked him so much
so I rebelled against her

1258
00:46:23,034 --> 00:46:24,896
and did things and got
in trouble for them.

1259
00:46:24,931 --> 00:46:27,034
And what kind of consequences
would you get for that?

1260
00:46:27,068 --> 00:46:29,655
I wasn't allowed to
like go out places-

1261
00:46:29,689 --> 00:46:30,827
Did you get grounded?

1262
00:46:30,862 --> 00:46:32,448
My life was
basically grounded.

1263
00:46:32,482 --> 00:46:33,862
And so you got pregnant,
how did she take that?

1264
00:46:33,896 --> 00:46:35,551
She was angry obviously,

1265
00:46:35,586 --> 00:46:37,137
and then it was like, well
what are you gonna do?

1266
00:46:37,172 --> 00:46:39,000
She didn't have like
an initial reaction,

1267
00:46:39,034 --> 00:46:40,896
she just questioned me.

1268
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:42,310

to be a parent?

are what are essential

what you want and negotiate it.

You have to think that way?

1562

We had to think that way,

1563
