1
00:00:06,484 --> 00:00:07,529
>> HEY, I'M KAYLA.

2
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:09,139
I'M 17, AND I LIVE

3
00:00:09,139 --> 00:00:10,749
IN CENTRE, ALABAMA,

4
00:00:10,749 --> 00:00:12,099
A TINY TOWN IN THE HEART

5
00:00:12,099 --> 00:00:13,796
OF THE DEEP SOUTH.

6
00:00:13,796 --> 00:00:14,840
ALL MY LIFE, I'VE BEEN

7
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,712
PRETTY SPOILED BY MY PARENTS,

8
00:00:16,712 --> 00:00:18,540
BUT I'M FULL OF SOUTHERN CHARM,

9
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,802
WHICH COMES IN HANDY WHEN

10
00:00:19,802 --> 00:00:21,673
I COMPETE IN BEAUTY PAGEANTS.

11
00:00:21,673 --> 00:00:22,587
DON'T GET ME WRONG;

12
00:00:22,587 --> 00:00:24,024
JUST BECAUSE I'M GIRLY

13
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,155
DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T KNOW HOW

14
00:00:25,155 --> 00:00:26,461
TO GET MY HANDS DIRTY.

15
00:00:26,461 --> 00:00:28,332
I RIDE HORSES AND GO HUNTING

16
00:00:28,332 --> 00:00:29,942
WITH MY BOYFRIEND, J.R.,

17
00:00:29,942 --> 00:00:30,595
ALL THE TIME.

18
00:00:30,595 --> 00:00:32,162
OH, GOOD JOB.

19
00:00:32,162 --> 00:00:33,207
YOU WOULD HAVE KILLED HIM.

20
00:00:33,207 --> 00:00:34,208
J.R.'S ALREADY GRADUATED

21
00:00:34,208 --> 00:00:35,426
HIGH SCHOOL.

22
00:00:35,426 --> 00:00:36,645
WE'VE ONLY BEEN TOGETHER

23
00:00:36,645 --> 00:00:37,994
FOR SIX MONTHS,

24
00:00:37,994 --> 00:00:39,213
BUT I DEFINITELY THINK

25
00:00:39,213 --> 00:00:40,083
HE'S THE ONE.

26
00:00:40,083 --> 00:00:41,476
AND ONE DAY, HE MIGHT BE

27
00:00:41,476 --> 00:00:42,520
LUCKY ENOUGH TO WALK ME

28
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,782
DOWN THE AISLE.

29
00:00:43,782 --> 00:00:44,957
BUT FOR NOW, I'M GOING

30
00:00:44,957 --> 00:00:46,263
TO ENJOY MY SENIOR YEAR

31
00:00:46,263 --> 00:00:47,308
WITH MY FRIENDS,

32
00:00:47,308 --> 00:00:48,700
AND I'M REALLY EXCITED

33
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,441
FOR PROM AND SPRING BREAK.

34
00:00:50,441 --> 00:00:51,703
BUT MY DAYS OF BEING

35
00:00:51,703 --> 00:00:53,183
A CAREFREE SOUTHERN BELLE

36
00:00:53,183 --> 00:00:54,271
MIGHT BE NUMBERED,

37
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:58,232
MIGHT BE NUMBERED,
BECAUSE I'M PREGNANT.

38
00:00:58,232 --> 00:01:07,937
BECAUSE I'M PREGNANT.

39
00:01:07,937 --> 00:01:09,112
I ALWAYS GREW UP THINKING

40
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:10,331
I HAD TO BE THE PERFECT

41
00:01:10,331 --> 00:01:11,854
PAGEANT QUEEN WITH BRAINS,

42
00:01:11,854 --> 00:01:13,986
BEAUTY, AND GOOD VALUES.

43
00:01:13,986 --> 00:01:14,900
SO WHEN I FOUND OUT

44
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:15,988
I WAS PREGNANT,

45
00:01:15,988 --> 00:01:17,338
I WAS REALLY SCARED

46
00:01:17,338 --> 00:01:18,165
EVERYONE WOULD JUDGE ME.

47
00:01:18,165 --> 00:01:19,340
WHEN I FIRST FOUND OUT,

48
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:20,515
I WAS SO SCARED.

49
00:01:20,515 --> 00:01:21,342
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT

50
00:01:21,342 --> 00:01:23,170
WHAT MY PARENTS WOULD THINK.

51
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:24,214
>> WERE YOU SCARED PEOPLE WERE

52
00:01:24,214 --> 00:01:25,259
GOING TO BE, LIKE, CALLING YOU

53
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:26,564
"TRASHY" AND ALL THAT

54
00:01:26,564 --> 00:01:27,696
BEHIND YOUR BACK?

55
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:28,740
>> I MEAN, PEOPLE PUT LABELS

56
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,177
ON EVERYTHING.

57
00:01:30,177 --> 00:01:31,265
>> HOW DID YOU TELL J.R.?

58
00:01:31,265 --> 00:01:32,875
>> I PULLED UP IN HIS DRIVEWAY

59
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:34,877
AND WAS, LIKE, BLOWING

60
00:01:34,877 --> 00:01:35,878
ON THE HORN.

61
00:01:35,878 --> 00:01:37,445
AND HE OPENED THE DOOR,

62
00:01:37,445 --> 00:01:39,273
AND I HELD UP THE TEST.

63
00:01:39,273 --> 00:01:41,231
AND HE HAD THE LOOK

64
00:01:41,231 --> 00:01:42,145
SOMEBODY JUST SLAPPED HIM

65
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:43,103
IN THE FACE.

66
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:44,408
HE WAS LIKE--

67
00:01:44,408 --> 00:01:46,802
ADVICE TO YOU TWO: ALWAYS WEAR

68
00:01:46,802 --> 00:01:47,672
A RAINCOAT.

69
00:01:47,672 --> 00:01:50,153
A RAINCOAT.
[laughter]

70
00:01:50,153 --> 00:01:52,068
[laughter]

71
00:01:52,068 --> 00:01:53,069
WAS SHE, LIKE, MAD?

72
00:01:53,069 --> 00:01:53,939
>> WELL, I MEAN,

73
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:55,158
I KNOW SHE'S UPSET,

74
00:01:55,158 --> 00:01:57,682
AND SHE'S SCARED FOR ME

75
00:01:57,682 --> 00:02:00,381
'CAUSE OF SCHOOL AND EVERYTHING.

76
00:02:00,381 --> 00:02:02,948
'CAUSE OF SCHOOL AND EVERYTHING.
BUT SHE'S TAKEN IT REALLY WELL.

77
00:02:02,948 --> 00:02:03,601
BUT SHE'S TAKEN IT REALLY WELL.

78
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:04,211
>> I KNOW.

79
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:05,386
LIKE, THEY'VE BEEN REALLY

80
00:02:05,386 --> 00:02:07,039
SUPPORTIVE, AND SO HAVE

81
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:08,258
J.R.'S PARENTS.

82
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:09,216
LIKE, I WAS SCARED FOR THEM

83
00:02:09,216 --> 00:02:10,130
TO KNOW, 'CAUSE I FIGURED

84
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,348
THEY'D THINK I WAS, LIKE,

85
00:02:11,348 --> 00:02:14,395
A SKANK OR SOMETHING.

86
00:02:14,395 --> 00:02:15,439
J.R. WAS RAISED

87
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:16,527
REALLY TRADITIONALLY,

88
00:02:16,527 --> 00:02:18,225
AND NOW THAT I'M SHOWING,

89
00:02:18,225 --> 00:02:20,009
I KNOW HE FEELS UNCOMFORTABLE

90
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:21,141
BEING OUT IN PUBLIC

91
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,403
WITH ME SO PREGNANT

92
00:02:22,403 --> 00:02:25,101
WITH ME SO PREGNANT
AND US NOT MARRIED.

93
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:29,975
AND US NOT MARRIED.

94
00:02:29,975 --> 00:02:32,326
>> UM, YEAH, THEY SHOULD KNOW.

95
00:02:32,326 --> 00:02:34,284
I MEAN...

96
00:02:34,284 --> 00:02:37,679
IT'S NOT EXACTLY INVISIBLE.

97
00:02:37,679 --> 00:02:38,897
I WONDER

98
00:02:38,897 --> 00:02:41,291
I WONDER
WHAT EVERYBODY'S THINKING.

99
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:44,903
WHAT EVERYBODY'S THINKING.

100
00:02:44,903 --> 00:02:47,863
>> THERE'S NO HIDING IT ANYMORE.

101
00:02:47,863 --> 00:02:49,299
IT'S REALLY SURPRISED ME,

102
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:50,431
HOW SUPPORTIVE AND LOVING

103
00:02:50,431 --> 00:02:51,519
MY PARENTS HAVE BEEN.

104
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:52,911
BUT DEEP DOWN, I KNOW

105
00:02:52,911 --> 00:02:54,261
IT'S BEEN DIFFICULT FOR THEM.

106
00:02:54,261 --> 00:02:55,305
I MEAN, I WAS SCARED

107
00:02:55,305 --> 00:02:57,351
TO TELL YOU, BECAUSE I FIGURED,

108
00:02:57,351 --> 00:02:58,743
YOU KNOW, YOU'D BE DISAPPOINTED

109
00:02:58,743 --> 00:02:59,396
IN ME.

110
00:02:59,396 --> 00:03:01,181
AND I DECIDED TO TELL MOM FIRST,

111
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:03,400
BECAUSE--I DON'T KNOW.

112
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,880
I FIGURED IT'D BE EASIER.

113
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,447
>> I STAYED STRONG

114
00:03:06,447 --> 00:03:08,797
IN FRONT OF YOU.

115
00:03:08,797 --> 00:03:12,366
IN FRONT OF YOU.
AND THEN, UM...

116
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:18,023
AND THEN, UM...

117
00:03:18,023 --> 00:03:20,678
BUT WHENEVER YOU WERE GONE,

118
00:03:20,678 --> 00:03:22,245
I WOULD CRY.

119
00:03:22,245 --> 00:03:23,638
AND DADDY KEPT ASKING ME

120
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:25,857
WHAT WAS WRONG, AND I TOLD HIM

121
00:03:25,857 --> 00:03:27,468
THAT--I JUST KEPT TELLING HIM

122
00:03:27,468 --> 00:03:29,034
I HAD PROBLEMS AT WORK.

123
00:03:29,034 --> 00:03:30,514
HE'S LIKE, "WHAT IS WRONG

124
00:03:30,514 --> 00:03:31,254
WITH YOU?

125
00:03:31,254 --> 00:03:32,995
AND WHAT IS GOING ON?"

126
00:03:32,995 --> 00:03:36,303
AND I SAID, "WELL, IT'S KAYLA."

127
00:03:36,303 --> 00:03:38,261
AND I DIDN'T HAVE TO TELL HIM;

128
00:03:38,261 --> 00:03:38,957
HE GUESSED.

129
00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:40,045
HE SAID, "SHE'S PREGNANT."

130
00:03:40,045 --> 00:03:41,395
AND I SAID, "YEAH."

131
00:03:41,395 --> 00:03:42,396
>> WELL, THE TIMING IS OFF

132
00:03:42,396 --> 00:03:43,048
ON IT.

133
00:03:43,048 --> 00:03:44,093
I MEAN, IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN

134
00:03:44,093 --> 00:03:45,747
SEVERAL YEARS ON DOWN THE ROAD.

135
00:03:45,747 --> 00:03:47,357
I WAS IN SHOCK TO START WITH.

136
00:03:47,357 --> 00:03:49,141
AND WHEN I REALLY FOUND OUT

137
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:51,231
IT'S SO, I KIND OF WORRIED

138
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,319
ABOUT WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO

139
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,450
ABOUT YOUR SCHOOLING,

140
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:54,234
'CAUSE WE'D ALREADY PLANNED

141
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:55,626
YOUR SCHOOL AND COLLEGE.

142
00:03:55,626 --> 00:03:56,671
WE'RE JUST GOING TO HAVE TO WORK

143
00:03:56,671 --> 00:03:58,150
AROUND IT.

144
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,543
>> THAT'S WHAT I WAS WORRIED

145
00:03:59,543 --> 00:04:00,631
ABOUT, IS, I DIDN'T WANT Y'ALL

146
00:04:00,631 --> 00:04:02,372
TO BE UPSET, AND I DIDN'T WANT

147
00:04:02,372 --> 00:04:04,331
Y'ALL TO THINK LESS OF ME.

148
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:05,245
>> WELL, WE NEVER THOUGHT LESS

149
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,420
OF YOU, BECAUSE YOU'RE

150
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:07,334
OUR DAUGHTER, AND WE KNOW

151
00:04:07,334 --> 00:04:08,726
THAT YOU'RE A GOOD PERSON

152
00:04:08,726 --> 00:04:11,120
AND THAT YOU HAVE A GOOD HEART.

153
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,426
AND THIS DOESN'T MAKE YOU

154
00:04:12,426 --> 00:04:14,558
ANY LESS OF A PERSON, KAYLA.

155
00:04:14,558 --> 00:04:15,298
>> I KNOW.

156
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:16,778
>> AND I WAS NEVER DISAPPOINTED

157
00:04:16,778 --> 00:04:17,866
IN YOU.

158
00:04:17,866 --> 00:04:19,041
THE HURT THAT I FELT

159
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:21,652
WAS BECAUSE OF ALL THE THINGS

160
00:04:21,652 --> 00:04:23,001
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

161
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:24,351
GO THROUGH FROM HERE ON OUT.

162
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:25,439
IT'S REALLY GOING TO BE HARD

163
00:04:25,439 --> 00:04:28,790
ON YOU.

164
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:30,313
>> I WAS GOING TO GO AWAY

165
00:04:30,313 --> 00:04:31,488
TO COLLEGE

166
00:04:31,488 --> 00:04:32,707
AND STUDY TO BE A NURSE,

167
00:04:32,707 --> 00:04:33,925
BUT NOW THAT ISN'T GOING

168
00:04:33,925 --> 00:04:35,753
TO HAPPEN.

169
00:04:35,753 --> 00:04:37,668
J.R. WANTS US TO MOVE IN

170
00:04:37,668 --> 00:04:39,844
TOGETHER ONCE THE BABY'S BORN,

171
00:04:39,844 --> 00:04:40,976
BUT RIGHT NOW, HE LIVES

172
00:04:40,976 --> 00:04:42,020
WITH HIS PARENTS

173
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,239
AND DOESN'T MAKE ENOUGH MONEY

174
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:44,719
AT HIS MECHANIC JOB.

175
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:45,546
>> THANK YOU.

176
00:04:45,546 --> 00:04:46,286
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

177
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,809
AND EVEN THOUGH I KNOW

178
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:49,158
HE'S THE ONE FOR ME,

179
00:04:49,158 --> 00:04:50,377
IT'S HARD IMAGINING

180
00:04:50,377 --> 00:04:51,900
MOVING AWAY FROM MY MOM.

181
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:52,901
>> GET YOU DIRTY.

182
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:53,858
>> [laughs]

183
00:04:53,858 --> 00:04:55,643
>> LOVE YOU.

184
00:04:55,643 --> 00:04:57,079
>> AND NOW THAT WE FOUND OUT

185
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,385
WE'RE HAVING A BABY BOY,

186
00:04:58,385 --> 00:05:00,343
WE HAVE TO MAKE A PLAN.

187
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:02,432
SO I RECKON YOU'RE EXCITED

188
00:05:02,432 --> 00:05:04,347
ABOUT HAVING A LITTLE BOY.

189
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:05,479
>> I'M REALLY THRILLED

190
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:06,218
ABOUT HAVING A BOY

191
00:05:06,218 --> 00:05:08,308
TO CARRY ON THE FAMILY NAME.

192
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,526
>> I REALLY THOUGHT

193
00:05:09,526 --> 00:05:10,875
HE WAS GOING TO BE A GIRL.

194
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:11,833
>> I KNOWED HE WASN'T GOING

195
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:12,790
TO BE A LITTLE GIRL.

196
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:13,704
I TOLD YOU THE WHOLE TIME

197
00:05:13,704 --> 00:05:14,444
HE WAS GOING TO BE

198
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:15,402
A LITTLE BOY.

199
00:05:15,402 --> 00:05:16,185
>> YOU DIDN'T KNOW.

200
00:05:16,185 --> 00:05:17,055
>> YEAH, I KNEW.

201
00:05:17,055 --> 00:05:18,187
A DADDY'S INSTINCT.

202
00:05:18,187 --> 00:05:18,927
I KNEW IT.

203
00:05:18,927 --> 00:05:20,058
>> SO IS RYLAN

204
00:05:20,058 --> 00:05:22,147
THE OFFICIAL NAME?

205
00:05:22,147 --> 00:05:23,453
>> I RECKON SO.

206
00:05:23,453 --> 00:05:24,367
>> I LIKE RYLAN JASON

207
00:05:24,367 --> 00:05:25,586
THE BEST, SO--

208
00:05:25,586 --> 00:05:26,282
>> ME TOO.

209
00:05:26,282 --> 00:05:27,457
>> IT SOUNDS BETTER

210
00:05:27,457 --> 00:05:28,415
THAN ANY OTHER NAMES.

211
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:29,938
>> I JUST HOPE IT DON'T ACT

212
00:05:29,938 --> 00:05:32,549
ANYTHING LIKE YOU.

213
00:05:32,549 --> 00:05:34,508
MAYBE HE'LL LOOK LIKE YOU

214
00:05:34,508 --> 00:05:35,509
AND ACT LIKE ME,

215
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:39,513
SO HE'LL BE SWEET.

216
00:05:39,513 --> 00:05:40,818
>> DON'T FLATTER YOURSELF, NOW.

217
00:05:40,818 --> 00:05:41,776
>> ME AND DADDY WAS TALKING

218
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:43,430
ABOUT GETTING HIM ON HORSES

219
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:46,302
ABOUT GETTING HIM ON HORSES
AND STUFF.

220
00:05:46,302 --> 00:05:53,265
AND STUFF.

221
00:05:53,265 --> 00:05:54,049
>> SO DOES THAT MEAN

222
00:05:54,049 --> 00:05:55,529
YOU'RE SCARED?

223
00:05:55,529 --> 00:05:56,530
>> IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT

224
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,835
TO CALL IT.

225
00:05:57,835 --> 00:06:00,098
>> I HOPE J.R. ISN'T ALWAYS

226
00:06:00,098 --> 00:06:01,143
THIS STUBBORN.

227
00:06:01,143 --> 00:06:02,492
AND EVEN THOUGH I DON'T WANT

228
00:06:02,492 --> 00:06:03,667
THINGS TO MOVE TOO FAST,

229
00:06:03,667 --> 00:06:04,712
TODAY WE'RE GOING TO LOOK

230
00:06:04,712 --> 00:06:05,843
AT A HOUSE NEARBY

231
00:06:05,843 --> 00:06:07,410
THAT HIS PARENTS OWN.

232
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,237
WE CAN MOVE INTO IT

233
00:06:08,237 --> 00:06:09,456
IF WE GET MARRIED.

234
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:12,110
>> THIS WAS MY GRANDMOTHER

235
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:12,981
AND GRANDDADDY'S.

236
00:06:12,981 --> 00:06:14,286
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO USE IT.

237
00:06:14,286 --> 00:06:16,201
>> THE LIVING ROOM LOOKS GOOD

238
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:17,202
TO ME.

239
00:06:17,202 --> 00:06:18,856
>> IT NEEDS A LITTLE WORK.

240
00:06:18,856 --> 00:06:20,423
KITCHEN AND DINING ROOM.

241
00:06:20,423 --> 00:06:21,729
IT'S GOT BRAND-NEW CABINETS

242
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:23,078
AND APPLIANCES IN IT, SO WE

243
00:06:23,078 --> 00:06:24,209
DON'T HAVE TO EVEN BUY THEM.

244
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:25,080
>> IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE

245
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,734
THAT IT'S GETTING CLOSER

246
00:06:26,734 --> 00:06:29,389
TO TIME FOR US TO MOVE OUT

247
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:30,955
ON OUR OWN AND STUFF.

248
00:06:30,955 --> 00:06:32,609
I'M NERVOUS ABOUT IT TOO,

249
00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:34,089
ALL THOSE BILLS

250
00:06:34,089 --> 00:06:36,178
AND NOT LIVING AT HOME.

251
00:06:36,178 --> 00:06:37,571
>> I MEAN, I GUESS

252
00:06:37,571 --> 00:06:38,485
IT WILL BE DIFFERENT

253
00:06:38,485 --> 00:06:39,703
ONCE IT'S JUST ME AND YOU

254
00:06:39,703 --> 00:06:41,183
AND RYLAN LIVING HERE

255
00:06:41,183 --> 00:06:42,053
BY OURSELVES.

256
00:06:42,053 --> 00:06:45,492
BY OURSELVES.
>> YEAH.

257
00:06:45,492 --> 00:06:47,363
>> YEAH.

258
00:06:47,363 --> 00:06:48,538
I THOUGHT GETTING PREGNANT

259
00:06:48,538 --> 00:06:49,757
IN HIGH SCHOOL WAS SCARY,

260
00:06:49,757 --> 00:06:51,715
BUT TAKING ON THE RESPONSIBILITY

261
00:06:51,715 --> 00:06:53,630
OF A HOUSEHOLD AND A BABY

262
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,285
OF A HOUSEHOLD AND A BABY
IS TERRIFYING.

263
00:06:56,285 --> 00:07:04,206
IS TERRIFYING.

264
00:07:04,206 --> 00:07:05,468
>> RIGHT NOW, MY PLANS

265
00:07:05,468 --> 00:07:06,643
TO GO AWAY TO COLLEGE

266
00:07:06,643 --> 00:07:08,253
ARE ON HOLD, BUT I PLAN

267
00:07:08,253 --> 00:07:09,472
TO GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL

268
00:07:09,472 --> 00:07:11,387
AND GO TO A LOCAL COLLEGE.

269
00:07:11,387 --> 00:07:12,475
THERE'S ALWAYS BEEN

270
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:13,737
PREGNANT GIRLS AT MY SCHOOL,

271
00:07:13,737 --> 00:07:15,086
BUT I NEVER IMAGINED

272
00:07:15,086 --> 00:07:16,871
I WOULD BE ONE OF THEM.

273
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:18,263
BEING A PREGNANT TEENAGER

274
00:07:18,263 --> 00:07:19,439
DEFINITELY ISN'T IN ANY

275
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:22,311
DEFINITELY ISN'T IN ANY
PAGEANT HANDBOOK.

276
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:26,141
PAGEANT HANDBOOK.

277
00:07:26,141 --> 00:07:27,447
>> LOOK WHAT CAME IN THE MAIL,

278
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:30,232
MATERNITY PANTS.

279
00:07:30,232 --> 00:07:32,800
>> OH, I'M SO SCARED.

280
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,193
OH, THEY SEEM SO BIG.

281
00:07:35,193 --> 00:07:36,499
>> THEY LOOK A LITTLE DIFFERENT

282
00:07:36,499 --> 00:07:38,153
THAN THOSE SIZE FOURS, HUH?

283
00:07:38,153 --> 00:07:38,893
>> YEAH.

284
00:07:38,893 --> 00:07:40,024
>> ARE YOU GOING TO TRY THEM ON

285
00:07:40,024 --> 00:07:40,590
FOR ME?

286
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:41,548
I WANT TO SEE

287
00:07:41,548 --> 00:07:44,507
WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE ON YOU.

288
00:07:44,507 --> 00:07:45,856
>> [laughs]

289
00:07:45,856 --> 00:07:48,076
>> NOW, THOSE ARE A LITTLE BIG,

290
00:07:48,076 --> 00:07:49,338
AREN'T THEY?

291
00:07:49,338 --> 00:07:51,253
>> NO.

292
00:07:51,253 --> 00:07:52,863
>> OH, MY GOODNESS.

293
00:07:52,863 --> 00:07:54,125
THOSE, YOU WON'T BE ABLE

294
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,518
TO WEAR FOR A WHILE.

295
00:07:55,518 --> 00:07:58,695
SO ARE YOU, LIKE, "I HOPE

296
00:07:58,695 --> 00:08:00,654
I NEVER WEAR THESE"?

297
00:08:00,654 --> 00:08:01,698
IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING?

298
00:08:01,698 --> 00:08:03,178
>> YEAH.

299
00:08:03,178 --> 00:08:04,701
IS MY LEGS REALLY GOING TO BE

300
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:05,833
THAT BIG?

301
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,487
LIKE, ARE THEY REALLY GOING

302
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:11,142
TO JUST BE--

303
00:08:11,142 --> 00:08:12,317
>> I MEAN, YOU'RE GOING

304
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:13,623
TO GAIN WEIGHT.

305
00:08:13,623 --> 00:08:14,537
YOU'RE GOING TO GET

306
00:08:14,537 --> 00:08:15,712
A LOT BIGGER

307
00:08:15,712 --> 00:08:16,931
THAN WHAT YOU ARE RIGHT NOW.

308
00:08:16,931 --> 00:08:17,975
>> I WAS HOPING I WAS JUST GOING

309
00:08:17,975 --> 00:08:21,283
TO GAIN BELLY, NOT GAIN

310
00:08:21,283 --> 00:08:23,067
ALL THAT.

311
00:08:23,067 --> 00:08:26,593
>> [laughs]

312
00:08:26,593 --> 00:08:27,898
>> I HOPE RYLAN DOESN'T

313
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:29,770
TAKE AFTER J.R. AND NOT LIKE

314
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:32,076
HORSES, BECAUSE I LOVE RIDING,

315
00:08:32,076 --> 00:08:33,425
AND I WANT TO BE ABLE TO DO IT

316
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:34,601
WITH MY SON.

317
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:35,427
>> SO HAVE YOU TALKED

318
00:08:35,427 --> 00:08:36,516
TO THE DOCTOR ABOUT HOW MUCH

319
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,561
LONGER YOU'LL BE ABLE TO RIDE?

320
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:39,823
>> SHE DIDN'T REALLY SAY.

321
00:08:39,823 --> 00:08:41,564
SHE JUST SAID SHE RODE

322
00:08:41,564 --> 00:08:43,740
UP TO--SHE WAS, LIKE, 38 WEEKS.

323
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,873
SO IT SHOULDN'T BE ANY PROBLEM

324
00:08:45,873 --> 00:08:47,701
JUST AS LONG AS I DON'T TROT

325
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:49,616
OR RUN.

326
00:08:49,616 --> 00:08:51,618
>> WELL, MAKE SURE.

327
00:08:51,618 --> 00:08:52,836
>> WE PROBABLY WON'T GET

328
00:08:52,836 --> 00:08:53,750
TO RIDE MUCH

329
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,622
AFTER RYLAN GETS HERE.

330
00:08:55,622 --> 00:08:56,753
>> YOU CAN RIDE SOME.

331
00:08:56,753 --> 00:08:57,580
IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH

332
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,363
WITH GOING TO SCHOOL

333
00:08:58,363 --> 00:09:01,236
AND STUFF, BUT I THINK

334
00:09:01,236 --> 00:09:02,324
WE CAN RIDE.

335
00:09:02,324 --> 00:09:03,238
WE'LL JUST HAVE TO MAKE

336
00:09:03,238 --> 00:09:04,413
SOME TIME.

337
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:05,457
>> I HOPE RYLAN DON'T

338
00:09:05,457 --> 00:09:07,938
TAKE AFTER J.R. AND NOT LIKE

339
00:09:07,938 --> 00:09:09,331
HORSES.

340
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:11,246
>> OH, YOU'LL GET J.R. RIDING.

341
00:09:11,246 --> 00:09:12,595
IT JUST TAKES SOME TIME.

342
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:15,380
IT JUST TAKES SOME TIME.
>> I HOPE.

343
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:16,947
>> I HOPE.

344
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:18,340
THE WEEKS ARE GOING BY

345
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,646
FASTER AND FASTER, AND I'M

346
00:09:19,646 --> 00:09:22,779
ALREADY SIX MONTHS PREGNANT.

347
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:25,390
>> OKAY.

348
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,522
>> HE'S LIKE, "I JUST WANT

349
00:09:26,522 --> 00:09:28,698
TO BE LEFT ALONE."

350
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:30,221
>> HE'S GOT THE SWEETEST

351
00:09:30,221 --> 00:09:31,745
LITTLE PUG NOSE

352
00:09:31,745 --> 00:09:32,746
AND THAT LITTLE TOP BIT

353
00:09:32,746 --> 00:09:33,921
THAT JUST POKES OUT.

354
00:09:33,921 --> 00:09:35,313
I THINK HE'S TRYING TO SUCK

355
00:09:35,313 --> 00:09:36,750
HIS FINGER OR SOMETHING.

356
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,751
LOOK.

357
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:39,187
>> BUT EVEN THOUGH OUR PARENTS

358
00:09:39,187 --> 00:09:40,231
HAVE ACCEPTED WE'RE HAVING

359
00:09:40,231 --> 00:09:42,059
A BABY, WE'RE GOING TO NEED

360
00:09:42,059 --> 00:09:43,234
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO

361
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:44,714
WHEN HE GETS HERE.

362
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:45,672
>> KAYLA, I FEEL LIKE

363
00:09:45,672 --> 00:09:47,717
YOU HAVE HAD PART OF

364
00:09:47,717 --> 00:09:48,805
YOUR CHILDHOOD PRETTY MUCH

365
00:09:48,805 --> 00:09:50,111
TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU.

366
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:51,547
I JUST HOPE THAT YOU DON'T HAVE

367
00:09:51,547 --> 00:09:54,071
ANY HARD FEELINGS TOWARD J.R.

368
00:09:54,071 --> 00:09:55,595
ABOUT, YOU KNOW, YOUR PREGNANCY

369
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,466
AND MISSING OUT ON A LOT

370
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:58,728
OF YOUR SENIOR YEAR,

371
00:09:58,728 --> 00:10:00,687
BECAUSE IT'S A SPECIAL TIME

372
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:01,601
FOR YOU, AND J.R. GOT

373
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:02,776
TO EXPERIENCE ALL THAT.

374
00:10:02,776 --> 00:10:04,778
>> I MEAN, IN EVERY SITUATION,

375
00:10:04,778 --> 00:10:06,214
I TRY TO, YOU KNOW,

376
00:10:06,214 --> 00:10:07,824
MAKE THE BEST OUT OF IT.

377
00:10:07,824 --> 00:10:08,695
>> I STILL FEEL GUILTY

378
00:10:08,695 --> 00:10:09,609
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED,

379
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,393
BUT I THINK WHAT WE HAVE

380
00:10:11,393 --> 00:10:12,742
IS MORE SPECIAL

381
00:10:12,742 --> 00:10:14,396
THAN A LOT OF THINGS

382
00:10:14,396 --> 00:10:15,266
THAT YOU CAN DO

383
00:10:15,266 --> 00:10:16,703
IN YOUR SENIOR YEAR.

384
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,269
YOU CAN'T TURN BACK TIME.

385
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:19,053
>> SO IF Y'ALL DON'T

386
00:10:19,053 --> 00:10:20,707
GET MARRIED BEFORE THE BABY

387
00:10:20,707 --> 00:10:22,056
COMES, WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS?

388
00:10:22,056 --> 00:10:23,448
BECAUSE I FEEL REAL STRONG

389
00:10:23,448 --> 00:10:24,841
ABOUT, YOU KNOW,

390
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:25,973
NOT MOVING IN TOGETHER

391
00:10:25,973 --> 00:10:27,365
UNTIL YOU'RE MARRIED,

392
00:10:27,365 --> 00:10:28,715
AND I KNOW YOUR DAD, J.R.,

393
00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:30,238
FEELS THE SAME WAY.

394
00:10:30,238 --> 00:10:31,456
>> YOU KNOW, I SORT OF HATE IT

395
00:10:31,456 --> 00:10:34,546
THAT HE'S GOING TO BE BORN

396
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:36,723
AND WE'RE NOT MARRIED.

397
00:10:36,723 --> 00:10:38,725
BUT WHEN THAT BABY GETS HERE,

398
00:10:38,725 --> 00:10:39,856
I'M NOT SPENDING A NIGHT

399
00:10:39,856 --> 00:10:41,075
AWAY FROM HIM.

400
00:10:41,075 --> 00:10:42,337
>> IT JUST MAKES ME FEEL LIKE

401
00:10:42,337 --> 00:10:43,773
THAT'S TAKING THE GIFT

402
00:10:43,773 --> 00:10:45,209
OF MARRIAGE AWAY

403
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:47,690
WHEN YOU'RE, YOU KNOW,

404
00:10:47,690 --> 00:10:49,518
ALREADY TOGETHER AT NIGHT.

405
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:51,607
AND I DON'T BLAME YOU ONE BIT,

406
00:10:51,607 --> 00:10:52,913
BUT THAT'S JUST MY FEELINGS

407
00:10:52,913 --> 00:10:54,436
ABOUT IT.

408
00:10:54,436 --> 00:10:55,655
>> I ALREADY LOVE THIS CHILD

409
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,525
MORE THAN ANYTHING

410
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:58,092
IN THIS WORLD, AND I WANT

411
00:10:58,092 --> 00:10:59,571
TO ALWAYS BE THERE FOR IT

412
00:10:59,571 --> 00:11:02,923
TO ALWAYS BE THERE FOR IT
AND DO WHAT'S BEST FOR IT.

413
00:11:02,923 --> 00:11:06,361
AND DO WHAT'S BEST FOR IT.

414
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:08,232
>> YOUR MOM WAS KIND OF WORRIED

415
00:11:08,232 --> 00:11:10,887
ABOUT US STAYING TOGETHER

416
00:11:10,887 --> 00:11:12,454
AFTER THE BABY'S BORN

417
00:11:12,454 --> 00:11:13,977
AND US NOT BEING MARRIED.

418
00:11:13,977 --> 00:11:14,891
>> YEAH.

419
00:11:14,891 --> 00:11:16,676
I MEAN, SHE KNOWS THAT I'M NOT

420
00:11:16,676 --> 00:11:18,895
GOING TO SPEND A NIGHT AWAY

421
00:11:18,895 --> 00:11:19,679
FROM MY BABY.

422
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,506
SO, I MEAN, SHE'S JUST

423
00:11:21,506 --> 00:11:23,770
CONCERNED, LIKE ANY MOTHER IS.

424
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:24,814
I'M SURE YOUR MOM HAS

425
00:11:24,814 --> 00:11:25,902
THE SAME FEELINGS.

426
00:11:25,902 --> 00:11:26,860
I MEAN, I STILL WANT

427
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,600
TO GET MARRIED, BUT, YOU KNOW,

428
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,471
THAT STILL JUST DEPENDS

429
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:31,168
ON HOW EVERYTHING ELSE

430
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:33,954
ON HOW EVERYTHING ELSE
WORKS OUT.

431
00:11:33,954 --> 00:11:40,961
WORKS OUT.

432
00:11:40,961 --> 00:11:42,702
>> J.R. REALLY WANTS ME, HIM,

433
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,007
AND RYLAN ALL UNDER

434
00:11:44,007 --> 00:11:46,531
THE SAME ROOF, BUT I'M NOT SURE

435
00:11:46,531 --> 00:11:49,056
THE SAME ROOF, BUT I'M NOT SURE
I'M READY FOR THAT.

436
00:11:49,056 --> 00:11:56,628
I'M READY FOR THAT.

437
00:11:56,628 --> 00:11:57,847
>> EVEN THOUGH I HAVE A TON

438
00:11:57,847 --> 00:11:59,240
ON MY PLATE, I'M TRYING MY BEST

439
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,415
TO DO EVERYTHING I DID

440
00:12:00,415 --> 00:12:01,808
BEFORE I GOT PREGNANT,

441
00:12:01,808 --> 00:12:04,941
INCLUDING MY PAGEANTS.

442
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:06,203
UM, HEY.

443
00:12:06,203 --> 00:12:07,335
I WAS WANTING TO KNOW

444
00:12:07,335 --> 00:12:09,163
ABOUT THE PAGEANT, WHERE IT SAYS

445
00:12:09,163 --> 00:12:10,947
THE CONTESTANTS CANNOT HAVE

446
00:12:10,947 --> 00:12:11,556
ANY CHILDREN.

447
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:12,906
I HAD THOUGHT ABOUT MAYBE

448
00:12:12,906 --> 00:12:13,950
SIGNING UP NEXT YEAR,

449
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:15,169
BUT I WAS WANTING TO KNOW

450
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:17,911
BUT I WAS WANTING TO KNOW
WHY THAT WAS.

451
00:12:17,911 --> 00:12:31,881
WHY THAT WAS.

452
00:12:31,881 --> 00:12:32,490
>> THANK YOU.

453
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,883
>> OKAY, WELL, I'M SORRY.

454
00:12:33,883 --> 00:12:34,797
>> BYE.

455
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:35,972
>> BYE.

456
00:12:35,972 --> 00:12:37,757
>> BEING A TEEN MOM MAY MEAN

457
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:38,714
I HAVE TO SAY GOOD-BYE

458
00:12:38,714 --> 00:12:40,281
TO SOME THINGS, BUT I'M NOT

459
00:12:40,281 --> 00:12:42,109
GOING TO MISS OUT ON GRADUATION,

460
00:12:42,109 --> 00:12:44,285
SO MY MOM AND J.R.'S MOM

461
00:12:44,285 --> 00:12:45,895
ARE HELPING ME FIGURE OUT

462
00:12:45,895 --> 00:12:47,375
HOW I CAN FINISH SCHOOL.

463
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,464
>> HOPEFULLY, KAYLA WILL ONLY

464
00:12:49,464 --> 00:12:50,552
HAVE TO MISS, WHAT,

465
00:12:50,552 --> 00:12:51,858
TWO WEEKS, MAYBE, OF SCHOOL?

466
00:12:51,858 --> 00:12:53,294
>> WE'RE HOPING.

467
00:12:53,294 --> 00:12:54,599
I'M GOING TO TAKE OFF

468
00:12:54,599 --> 00:12:56,123
FROM WORK THE FIRST WEEK

469
00:12:56,123 --> 00:12:57,080
AND STAY HOME WITH KAYLA

470
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,212
TILL SHE GETS FEELING

471
00:12:58,212 --> 00:12:59,256
A LITTLE BIT MORE COMFORTABLE.

472
00:12:59,256 --> 00:13:00,431
>> MY SISTER, JENNIFER,

473
00:13:00,431 --> 00:13:01,563
SAYS SHE WOULD LOVE TO KEEP HIM

474
00:13:01,563 --> 00:13:02,999
SOME OF HER DAYS OFF.

475
00:13:02,999 --> 00:13:04,044
>> THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

476
00:13:04,044 --> 00:13:05,088
>> AND I CAN PROBABLY TAKE

477
00:13:05,088 --> 00:13:06,698
A WEEK OF MY VACATION.

478
00:13:06,698 --> 00:13:07,743
SO I DON'T THINK IT'S GOING

479
00:13:07,743 --> 00:13:09,136
TO BE THAT BAD OF AN ISSUE.

480
00:13:09,136 --> 00:13:10,006
OF COURSE, I HOPE

481
00:13:10,006 --> 00:13:12,313
THE POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION--

482
00:13:12,313 --> 00:13:13,227
>> MOM WAS TELLING ME

483
00:13:13,227 --> 00:13:14,141
ABOUT THAT, AND I'VE NEVER

484
00:13:14,141 --> 00:13:14,968
HEARD ABOUT IT,

485
00:13:14,968 --> 00:13:16,404
AND IT SOUNDS SCARY.

486
00:13:16,404 --> 00:13:17,884
SHE WAS TELLING ME, LIKE,

487
00:13:17,884 --> 00:13:20,887
SOME MOMS GO CRAZY AND STUFF.

488
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:22,062
LIKE, THEY CAN'T STAND

489
00:13:22,062 --> 00:13:23,106
TO HEAR THEM CRY

490
00:13:23,106 --> 00:13:24,978
AND ALL THIS KIND OF STUFF.

491
00:13:24,978 --> 00:13:26,718
AND I WAS LIKE, "OH, MY GOD,

492
00:13:26,718 --> 00:13:27,719
THAT'S SCARY.

493
00:13:27,719 --> 00:13:29,896
HOW CAN ANYBODY FEEL LIKE THAT?"

494
00:13:29,896 --> 00:13:30,853
>> IT'S AN UNCONTROLLABLE

495
00:13:30,853 --> 00:13:32,072
FEELING.

496
00:13:32,072 --> 00:13:33,725
WITH MY DEPRESSION WAS--

497
00:13:33,725 --> 00:13:34,944
MY MOTHER, EVERY TIME

498
00:13:34,944 --> 00:13:36,990
SHE WOULD LEAVE, I WOULD CRY.

499
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:37,904
SO I'D CALL HER AT 10:00

500
00:13:37,904 --> 00:13:38,992
AT NIGHT, YOU KNOW,

501
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:39,819
AND JUST BEG HER TO PLEASE COME

502
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:40,907
AND SLEEP ON THE SOFA.

503
00:13:40,907 --> 00:13:42,473
[laughter]

504
00:13:42,473 --> 00:13:43,300
SO FOR ABOUT THE FIRST

505
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,214
TWO WEEKS, SHE PRETTY MUCH

506
00:13:44,214 --> 00:13:45,259
LIVED WITH US.

507
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:46,782
>> I'LL PROBABLY BE LIKE PAM.

508
00:13:46,782 --> 00:13:47,870
I'LL PROBABLY CRY EVERY TIME

509
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:49,045
YOU LEAVE.

510
00:13:49,045 --> 00:13:51,961
[laughter]

511
00:13:51,961 --> 00:13:52,832
>> YOU CRY

512
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:53,876
EVERY TIME I LEAVE NOW.

513
00:13:53,876 --> 00:13:54,790
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

514
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:56,096
[laughter]

515
00:13:56,096 --> 00:13:57,488
>> MY MOM'S SO SUPPORTIVE.

516
00:13:57,488 --> 00:13:58,968
I CAN'T IMAGINE NOT LIVING

517
00:13:58,968 --> 00:14:00,535
UNDER THE SAME ROOF AS HER

518
00:14:00,535 --> 00:14:02,580
ONCE I HAVE A BABY.

519
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,104
I'M SURE J.R. WILL UNDERSTAND,

520
00:14:04,104 --> 00:14:06,062
ESPECIALLY SINCE HE'S GOT

521
00:14:06,062 --> 00:14:07,063
A GIRLFRIEND WHO GOES HUNTING

522
00:14:07,063 --> 00:14:08,021
WITH HIM.

523
00:14:08,021 --> 00:14:09,544
>> HOW'S YOUR OUTFIT WORKING

524
00:14:09,544 --> 00:14:10,414
FOR YOU?

525
00:14:10,414 --> 00:14:11,938
>> IT'S A LITTLE SNUG HERE.

526
00:14:11,938 --> 00:14:14,114
OH, MY GOSH.

527
00:14:14,114 --> 00:14:16,943
>> NEED SOME HELP?

528
00:14:16,943 --> 00:14:19,467
>> I CAN'T SUCK IN.

529
00:14:19,467 --> 00:14:21,599
OOH.

530
00:14:21,599 --> 00:14:24,080
OOH.
[laughs]

531
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:25,342
[laughs]

532
00:14:25,342 --> 00:14:26,909
MY BELLY GETS IN THE WAY

533
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:29,303
MY BELLY GETS IN THE WAY
OF MY KNEES.

534
00:14:29,303 --> 00:14:32,001
OF MY KNEES.

535
00:14:32,001 --> 00:14:32,697
>> THERE YOU GO.

536
00:14:32,697 --> 00:14:33,350
KEEP SWINGING.

537
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:36,005
TWIST.

538
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:39,835
>> OKAY, I'M GOOD.

539
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:42,794
[gunshot]

540
00:14:42,794 --> 00:14:43,534
OKAY.

541
00:14:43,534 --> 00:14:44,405
>> I'M EXCITED ABOUT

542
00:14:44,405 --> 00:14:46,146
BRINGING HIM HUNTING WITH ME.

543
00:14:46,146 --> 00:14:46,973
>> WHEN ARE YOU GOING

544
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:48,235
TO BUY HIM HIS FIRST GUN?

545
00:14:48,235 --> 00:14:49,192
>> I WOULD SORT OF LIKE

546
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:49,889
TO GET HIM ONE

547
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:51,281
BEFORE HE'S BORN.

548
00:14:51,281 --> 00:14:52,761
>> WHEN HE'S BORN?

549
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:54,067
>> YEAH, I MAY WAIT.

550
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:55,895
>> I WANT HIM TO LIKE TO HUNT

551
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,113
AND EVERYTHING TOO,

552
00:14:57,113 --> 00:14:59,115
AND I HOPE HE'S, LIKE,

553
00:14:59,115 --> 00:15:01,291
REALLY ACTIVE IN SPORTS.

554
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,727
AND I HOPE HE LOVES HORSES,

555
00:15:02,727 --> 00:15:05,992
LIKE ME, AND RIDES,

556
00:15:05,992 --> 00:15:08,168
UNLIKE YOU, STUBBORN BUTT.

557
00:15:08,168 --> 00:15:10,518
IT MAKES ME SAD TO--LIKE,

558
00:15:10,518 --> 00:15:13,825
THE FACT THAT I'M HAVING

559
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:15,523
TO GROW UP, SOMETIMES.

560
00:15:15,523 --> 00:15:17,307
I CAN'T IMAGINE NOT LIVING

561
00:15:17,307 --> 00:15:18,569
IN A HOUSE WITH MY MOM

562
00:15:18,569 --> 00:15:19,570
AND HER NOT BEING THERE

563
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,745
EVERY DAY.

564
00:15:20,745 --> 00:15:22,660
>> YOU GOT TO GROW UP SOMETIMES.

565
00:15:22,660 --> 00:15:23,966
>> I KNOW.

566
00:15:23,966 --> 00:15:25,141
>> AND LEAVE YOUR MAMA.

567
00:15:25,141 --> 00:15:26,055
>> I KNOW.

568
00:15:26,055 --> 00:15:27,056
>> YOUR MOM AIN'T GONNA ALWAYS

569
00:15:27,056 --> 00:15:28,318
BE THERE.

570
00:15:28,318 --> 00:15:29,537
HOPEFULLY, YOU CAN DEPEND

571
00:15:29,537 --> 00:15:33,149
ON ME.

572
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:34,934
>> GOING HUNTING WAS FUN

573
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:35,891
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS

574
00:15:35,891 --> 00:15:37,719
PRETTY UNSUCCESSFUL.

575
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:39,155
BUT IT UPSET ME THAT J.R. DIDN'T

576
00:15:39,155 --> 00:15:40,722
TRY TO UNDERSTAND MY FEARS

577
00:15:40,722 --> 00:15:42,202
ABOUT MOVING OUT.

578
00:15:42,202 --> 00:15:43,333
I'VE ALREADY HAD TO SACRIFICE

579
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:45,161
MY PAGEANTS AND COLLEGE,

580
00:15:45,161 --> 00:15:46,684
AND I'M NOT SURE I'M READY

581
00:15:46,684 --> 00:15:47,947
TO GIVE UP MY MOM TOO.

582
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,035
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK

583
00:15:49,035 --> 00:15:51,037
ABOUT MOVING OUT?

584
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:51,951
I MEAN, YOU'VE LIVED HERE

585
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,039
SINCE YOU WERE BORN.

586
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:54,083
>> I'M NERVOUS.

587
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,563
SOMETIMES I DON'T EVEN WANT

588
00:15:55,563 --> 00:15:57,957
TO MOVE OUT, BUT...

589
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,437
I MEAN, I'VE GOT TO SOMETIME.

590
00:16:00,437 --> 00:16:01,743
>> WHAT ABOUT SCHOOL?

591
00:16:01,743 --> 00:16:02,657
YOU'RE DISAPPOINTED

592
00:16:02,657 --> 00:16:03,832
ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE TO GO

593
00:16:03,832 --> 00:16:05,660
TO COLLEGE, RIGHT?

594
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:08,315
>> GADSDEN STATE COMMUNITY

595
00:16:08,315 --> 00:16:10,143
COLLEGE IS A BIG STEP DOWN

596
00:16:10,143 --> 00:16:12,232
FROM WHAT I WANTED.

597
00:16:12,232 --> 00:16:14,103
LIKE, ALL MY CLOSEST FRIENDS,

598
00:16:14,103 --> 00:16:15,887
THEY'RE GOING TO U.A.B.

599
00:16:15,887 --> 00:16:16,932
>> SO YOU'RE GOING TO MISS

600
00:16:16,932 --> 00:16:17,933
YOUR FRIENDS WHEN THEY'RE GONE

601
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:21,241
YOUR FRIENDS WHEN THEY'RE GONE
AWAY TO COLLEGE?

602
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:23,678
AWAY TO COLLEGE?

603
00:16:23,678 --> 00:16:27,073
IT'S OKAY.

604
00:16:27,073 --> 00:16:28,074
GADSDEN STATE'S A WONDERFUL

605
00:16:28,074 --> 00:16:29,031
COLLEGE.

606
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:30,598
I MEAN, YOU CAN GET A JOB

607
00:16:30,598 --> 00:16:32,556
IN NURSING, JUST LIKE

608
00:16:32,556 --> 00:16:34,123
YOU HAD PLANNED ON

609
00:16:34,123 --> 00:16:37,170
YOU HAD PLANNED ON
AND YOU HAD HOPED FOR.

610
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,781
AND YOU HAD HOPED FOR.

611
00:16:39,781 --> 00:16:40,564
YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE

612
00:16:40,564 --> 00:16:43,611
NEW FRIENDS.

613
00:16:43,611 --> 00:16:46,222
NEW FRIENDS.
>> YEAH.

614
00:16:46,222 --> 00:16:48,181
>> YEAH.

615
00:16:48,181 --> 00:16:52,620
I MEAN, J.R. KNOWS I'M

616
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,144
DISAPPOINTED ABOUT NOT

617
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:56,580
BEING ABLE TO GO TO COLLEGE,

618
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,582
BUT I CAN'T REALLY TALK

619
00:16:58,582 --> 00:16:59,540
TO HIM ABOUT IT,

620
00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,107
'CAUSE HE GETS ILL.

621
00:17:01,107 --> 00:17:02,238
>> YOU NEED TO BE ABLE

622
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:04,066
TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT IT,

623
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:05,241
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

624
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:06,199
WHEN YOU GO INTO A MARRIAGE,

625
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:07,504
IT'S MORE THAN JUST

626
00:17:07,504 --> 00:17:09,028
TWO PEOPLE LIVING TOGETHER.

627
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:09,724
HE'S GOING TO BE

628
00:17:09,724 --> 00:17:11,682
YOUR BEST FRIEND, YOU KNOW.

629
00:17:11,682 --> 00:17:13,641
YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO TALK

630
00:17:13,641 --> 00:17:16,035
TO HIM ABOUT ANYTHING.

631
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:19,821
>> I KNOW.

632
00:17:19,821 --> 00:17:22,258
IT'S JUST BETTER NOT TO TALK

633
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:23,216
ABOUT IT.

634
00:17:23,216 --> 00:17:23,955
I MEAN--

635
00:17:23,955 --> 00:17:24,869
>> WELL, IF IT'S SOMETHING

636
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:25,783
THAT BOTHERS YOU, IT'S NOT

637
00:17:25,783 --> 00:17:26,741
BETTER NOT TO TALK ABOUT IT.

638
00:17:26,741 --> 00:17:27,655
IT'S BETTER JUST TO GET IT

639
00:17:27,655 --> 00:17:29,396
OFF YOUR CHEST.

640
00:17:29,396 --> 00:17:31,180
>> MY MOM'S RIGHT.

641
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,355
IF J.R. AND I ARE GOING

642
00:17:32,355 --> 00:17:33,530
TO MAKE THINGS WORK,

643
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,879
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TELL HIM

644
00:17:34,879 --> 00:17:37,360
I'M GOING TO HAVE TO TELL HIM
HOW I FEEL.

645
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:47,544
HOW I FEEL.

646
00:17:47,544 --> 00:17:48,589
>> EVEN THOUGH I'M GOING

647
00:17:48,589 --> 00:17:50,025
TO HAVE TO START BEING

648
00:17:50,025 --> 00:17:51,244
MORE HONEST WITH J.R.,

649
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:52,810
I CAN'T HELP BUT GET EXCITED

650
00:17:52,810 --> 00:17:53,768
WHEN THE WORD "MARRIAGE"

651
00:17:53,768 --> 00:17:54,508
COMES UP.

652
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:55,596
>> WHAT IF J.R. ASKS YOU

653
00:17:55,596 --> 00:17:57,989
TO MARRY HIM, LIKE,

654
00:17:57,989 --> 00:17:59,730
OUT OF THE BLUE?

655
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,254
YOU'RE LIKE, "WHAT?

656
00:18:01,254 --> 00:18:02,168
REALLY? WHAT?"

657
00:18:02,168 --> 00:18:03,647
>> I CAN'T, LIKE, IMAGINE IT.

658
00:18:03,647 --> 00:18:04,692
BUT I'M JUST AN EMOTIONAL

659
00:18:04,692 --> 00:18:05,606
PERSON.

660
00:18:05,606 --> 00:18:07,434
I'LL PROBABLY BAWL MY EYES OUT.

661
00:18:07,434 --> 00:18:09,697
I'LL PROBABLY--

662
00:18:09,697 --> 00:18:12,743
>> AW!

663
00:18:12,743 --> 00:18:13,788
IS IT GOING TO BE EASY

664
00:18:13,788 --> 00:18:16,834
FOR HIM TO GET A RING?

665
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:18,271
>> PROBABLY NOT.

666
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:20,011
LIKE, HE DON'T REALLY MAKE

667
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:23,406
THAT MUCH, AND WHAT MONEY

668
00:18:23,406 --> 00:18:24,755
HE DOES SAVE UP

669
00:18:24,755 --> 00:18:26,844
GOES TOWARDS BILLS.

670
00:18:26,844 --> 00:18:27,715
I DON'T THINK

671
00:18:27,715 --> 00:18:30,370
I DON'T THINK
IT'S GOING TO BE EASY.

672
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:36,376
IT'S GOING TO BE EASY.

673
00:18:36,376 --> 00:18:38,204
OKAY, LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

674
00:18:38,204 --> 00:18:39,466
MM!

675
00:18:39,466 --> 00:18:40,293
>> SINCE MY PREGNANCY

676
00:18:40,293 --> 00:18:41,294
HAS TAKEN ME OUT

677
00:18:41,294 --> 00:18:42,425
OF THE PAGEANT CIRCUIT,

678
00:18:42,425 --> 00:18:43,818
MY MOM ARRANGED A SPECIAL

679
00:18:43,818 --> 00:18:45,602
PHOTO SHOOT FOR ME.

680
00:18:45,602 --> 00:18:48,170
>> THAT IS SO PRETTY.

681
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:50,085
>> OH, WOW.

682
00:18:50,085 --> 00:18:51,782
>> J.R. SHOWED UP AFTER WORK

683
00:18:51,782 --> 00:18:53,306
FOR SOME COUPLE SHOTS.

684
00:18:53,306 --> 00:18:54,481
>> HEY, HEY.

685
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:56,265
OKAY.

686
00:18:56,265 --> 00:18:57,919
LET'S HAVE J.R.--LET'S HAVE

687
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,007
KAYLA--I'LL LET YOU TAKE

688
00:18:59,007 --> 00:19:00,313
JUST A COUPLE OF STEPS FORWARD,

689
00:19:00,313 --> 00:19:01,270
AND THEN, J.R., I'LL LET YOU

690
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:03,185
SLIDE IN BEHIND HER.

691
00:19:03,185 --> 00:19:04,230
BEAUTIFUL.

692
00:19:04,230 --> 00:19:05,274
MAYBE BRING YOUR HEAD FORWARD

693
00:19:05,274 --> 00:19:07,929
JUST--PERFECT.

694
00:19:07,929 --> 00:19:08,843
YAY.

695
00:19:08,843 --> 00:19:10,323
NOW GIVE HER A SWEET LITTLE KISS

696
00:19:10,323 --> 00:19:11,280
ON THE FOREHEAD BECAUSE SHE--

697
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,368
AW.

698
00:19:12,368 --> 00:19:16,111
HOT MAMA.

699
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:19,332
HOT MAMA.
MAYBE HOLD HIS HANDS.

700
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:31,300
MAYBE HOLD HIS HANDS.

701
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:34,216
>> THIS PAST YEAR HAS BEEN

702
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:37,741
THE GREATEST YEAR OF MY LIFE.

703
00:19:37,741 --> 00:19:43,007
I LOVE YOU, YOUR MOM, YOUR DAD,

704
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:45,619
YOUR WHOLE FAMILY.

705
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:48,796
AND YOU'VE MADE ME HAPPIER

706
00:19:48,796 --> 00:19:50,189
THAN ANYBODY COULD HAVE

707
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:51,668
EVER BEEN

708
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:55,411
IN THEIR WHOLE ENTIRE LIFE.

709
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:58,632
I LOVE YOU AND OUR BABY

710
00:19:58,632 --> 00:19:59,546
MORE THAN ANYTHING

711
00:19:59,546 --> 00:20:01,287
IN THIS WORLD.

712
00:20:01,287 --> 00:20:02,679
AND I WANT TO SPEND THE REST

713
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:05,769
OF MY LIFE WITH YOU.

714
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:08,468
KAYLA...

715
00:20:08,468 --> 00:20:12,428
KAYLA...
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

716
00:20:12,428 --> 00:20:20,088
WILL YOU MARRY ME?

717
00:20:20,088 --> 00:20:23,222
>> I COULDN'T TALK.

718
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,311
I'M SPEECHLESS.

719
00:20:25,311 --> 00:20:26,964
BUT YES, JUST IN CASE

720
00:20:26,964 --> 00:20:29,402
BUT YES, JUST IN CASE
YOU DIDN'T HEAR IT.

721
00:20:29,402 --> 00:20:37,105
YOU DIDN'T HEAR IT.

722
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:39,063
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

723
00:20:39,063 --> 00:20:42,937
I'VE ONLY CRIED FOR A WEEK.

724
00:20:42,937 --> 00:20:44,330
>> I LOVE YOU, BABY.

725
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:46,593
>> I LOVE YOU.

726
00:20:46,593 --> 00:20:48,508
I KNOW J.R. AND I STILL

727
00:20:48,508 --> 00:20:49,987
HAVE THINGS TO FIGURE OUT,

728
00:20:49,987 --> 00:20:51,641
BUT I CAN'T HELP BUT BE EXCITED

729
00:20:51,641 --> 00:20:53,034
ABOUT THIS RING.

730
00:20:53,034 --> 00:20:53,904
HEY.

731
00:20:53,904 --> 00:20:54,818
>> HI.

732
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:56,080
>> WELL...

733
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,473
>> OH!

734
00:20:57,473 --> 00:20:59,258
THAT'S PRECIOUS.

735
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,042
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

736
00:21:01,042 --> 00:21:02,522
>> THE DIAMONDS GO, LIKE,

737
00:21:02,522 --> 00:21:03,697
ALL THE WAY UNDER IT.

738
00:21:03,697 --> 00:21:05,089
>> SERIOUSLY?

739
00:21:05,089 --> 00:21:05,960
>> BIG DIAMONDS.

740
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,309
>> OH, WOW.

741
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:09,180
DOES IT FEEL ANY DIFFERENT NOW,

742
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,791
BEING ENGAGED AND HAVING

743
00:21:10,791 --> 00:21:11,705
A BABY ON THE WAY,

744
00:21:11,705 --> 00:21:12,749
THAN IT DID BEFORE?

745
00:21:12,749 --> 00:21:13,315
>> YEAH.

746
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:15,317
LIKE, NOW IT'S NOT LIKE

747
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:17,145
"ME AND MY BABY DADDY."

748
00:21:17,145 --> 00:21:19,103
IT'S "ME AND MY FIANCE."

749
00:21:19,103 --> 00:21:21,541
I WAS SUPER SURPRISED.

750
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:22,846
IT'S SCARY.

751
00:21:22,846 --> 00:21:23,804
>> YEAH.

752
00:21:23,804 --> 00:21:25,458
>> I'M EXCITED TO BE ENGAGED,

753
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:26,894
BUT I DON'T WANT TO MOVE

754
00:21:26,894 --> 00:21:27,895
TOO FAST.

755
00:21:27,895 --> 00:21:29,026
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW

756
00:21:29,026 --> 00:21:29,984
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MONEY

757
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,159
TO MOVE OUT,

758
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:32,334
TAKE CARE OF RYLAN,

759
00:21:32,334 --> 00:21:35,250
AND PAY FOR A WEDDING.

760
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,339
BUT MY WORRIES WILL HAVE TO

761
00:21:37,339 --> 00:21:39,080
WAIT, BECAUSE LATER THAT NIGHT,

762
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,342
I STARTED FEELING

763
00:21:40,342 --> 00:21:41,343
SOME CONTRACTIONS,

764
00:21:41,343 --> 00:21:42,692
AND MY DUE DATE

765
00:21:42,692 --> 00:21:48,089
ISN'T FOR ANOTHER FIVE WEEKS.

766
00:21:48,089 --> 00:21:48,872
MOM.

767
00:21:48,872 --> 00:21:49,525
>> WHAT IS IT?

768
00:21:49,525 --> 00:21:50,439
WHAT?

769
00:21:50,439 --> 00:21:51,310
>> I THINK I'M HAVING

770
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,136
CONTRACTIONS.

771
00:21:52,136 --> 00:21:53,007
WILL YOU COME TIME 'EM?

772
00:21:53,007 --> 00:21:53,877
>> ARE YOU SURE

773
00:21:53,877 --> 00:21:54,965
IT'S CONTRACTIONS?

774
00:21:54,965 --> 00:21:58,099
>> IT HURTS PRETTY BAD.

775
00:21:58,099 --> 00:22:00,928
>> IT HURTS PRETTY BAD.
>> OKAY.

776
00:22:00,928 --> 00:22:04,366
>> OKAY.

777
00:22:04,366 --> 00:22:05,324
ARE YOU HURTING NOW?

778
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:06,499
>> YEAH, I THINK I MIGHT

779
00:22:06,499 --> 00:22:07,195
HAVE ONE NOW.

780
00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:08,152
>> WELL, YOU GOT TO TELL ME

781
00:22:08,152 --> 00:22:09,066
WHEN YOU'RE HURTING, NOW,

782
00:22:09,066 --> 00:22:09,806
SO I CAN TIME 'EM.

783
00:22:09,806 --> 00:22:12,243
SO I CAN TIME 'EM.
>> WELL--

784
00:22:12,243 --> 00:22:15,508
>> WELL--

785
00:22:15,508 --> 00:22:17,336
LIKE, EARLIER, I HAD, LIKE,

786
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,425
SOME BLOODY-LOOKING--

787
00:22:19,425 --> 00:22:20,426
LIKE, I MEAN, IT WAS KIND OF

788
00:22:20,426 --> 00:22:21,383
PINKISH.

789
00:22:21,383 --> 00:22:23,385
AND, LIKE, THEY WERE HURTING

790
00:22:23,385 --> 00:22:27,781
PRETTY--A LOT, REALLY SEVERE.

791
00:22:27,781 --> 00:22:30,479
I THINK I'M HAVING ANOTHER ONE.

792
00:22:30,479 --> 00:22:31,350
I'M ABOUT TO GO

793
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,396
I'M ABOUT TO GO
TO THE BATHROOM.

794
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:40,489
TO THE BATHROOM.

795
00:22:40,489 --> 00:22:42,578
MOM, I'M, LIKE, BLEEDING, LIKE,

796
00:22:42,578 --> 00:22:43,840
REALLY BAD.

797
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,364
>> HOW BAD ARE YOU BLEEDING?

798
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:48,062
>> LIKE, IT'S BAD--LIKE, WORSE.

799
00:22:48,062 --> 00:22:49,498
IT'S NOT PINK ANYMORE.

800
00:22:49,498 --> 00:22:50,543
IT'S RED.

801
00:22:50,543 --> 00:22:51,631
>> OKAY, WE'RE GOING

802
00:22:51,631 --> 00:22:55,461
TO THE HOSPITAL NOW.

803
00:22:55,461 --> 00:22:56,592
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE

804
00:22:56,592 --> 00:22:57,811
THIS IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW.

805
00:22:57,811 --> 00:22:59,029
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO GO

806
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:00,074
INTO LABOR

807
00:23:00,074 --> 00:23:01,597
FOR ANOTHER FIVE WEEKS,

808
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:02,468
AND I'M REALLY NERVOUS

809
00:23:02,468 --> 00:23:05,906
SOMETHING IS WRONG.

810
00:23:05,906 --> 00:23:07,168
WHEN I GOT TO THE HOSPITAL,

811
00:23:07,168 --> 00:23:08,561
J.R. WAS THERE WAITING.

812
00:23:08,561 --> 00:23:09,431
I WAS ALREADY

813
00:23:09,431 --> 00:23:12,913
SEVEN CENTIMETERS DILATED.

814
00:23:12,913 --> 00:23:14,349
THE NURSES RUSHED ME

815
00:23:14,349 --> 00:23:16,003
INTO A DELIVERY ROOM.

816
00:23:16,003 --> 00:23:17,265
THE PAIN KEPT GETTING WORSE

817
00:23:17,265 --> 00:23:20,355
AND WORSE.

818
00:23:20,355 --> 00:23:22,183
ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT WAS TIME

819
00:23:22,183 --> 00:23:25,404
ALL OF A SUDDEN, IT WAS TIME
TO PUSH.

820
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:42,638
TO PUSH.

821
00:23:42,638 --> 00:23:44,423
EVEN THOUGH I WAS TERRIFIED

822
00:23:44,423 --> 00:23:45,467
SOMETHING WOULD BE WRONG

823
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:47,251
BECAUSE RYLAN WAS PREMATURE,

824
00:23:47,251 --> 00:23:49,515
HE CAME OUT WITH ALL TEN FINGERS

825
00:23:49,515 --> 00:23:53,170
AND TOES AND SEEMED PERFECT.

826
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,476
I CAN'T BELIEVE I MADE IT

827
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:55,477
THROUGH ALL THAT,

828
00:23:55,477 --> 00:23:59,394
THROUGH ALL THAT,
AND NOW I'M A MOM.

829
00:23:59,394 --> 00:24:08,229
AND NOW I'M A MOM.

830
00:24:08,229 --> 00:24:09,273
>> I'M SO HAPPY

831
00:24:09,273 --> 00:24:10,797
EVERYTHING IS OKAY WITH RYLAN,

832
00:24:10,797 --> 00:24:11,928
EVEN THOUGH HE IS

833
00:24:11,928 --> 00:24:13,539
FIVE WEEKS PREMATURE.

834
00:24:13,539 --> 00:24:14,453
>> HE LOOKS A LOT LIKE

835
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,062
HIS DADDY.

836
00:24:15,062 --> 00:24:16,106
>> HE'S GOT MOMMY'S

837
00:24:16,106 --> 00:24:18,718
LITTLE NOSE, THOUGH.

838
00:24:18,718 --> 00:24:20,676
>> WE SHOULD HAVE BROUGHT--

839
00:24:20,676 --> 00:24:22,939
>> WHAT DID THEY SAY?

840
00:24:22,939 --> 00:24:24,027
>> YOU KNOW I NEED YOU

841
00:24:24,027 --> 00:24:26,508
TO HOLD THE CAMERA.

842
00:24:26,508 --> 00:24:27,335
"I'M GOING TO GO SEE

843
00:24:27,335 --> 00:24:30,643
"I'M GOING TO GO SEE
MY GRANNER."

844
00:24:30,643 --> 00:24:37,693
MY GRANNER."

845
00:24:37,693 --> 00:24:42,698
MY GRANNER."
[Rylan crying]

846
00:24:42,698 --> 00:24:44,918
[Rylan crying]

847
00:24:44,918 --> 00:24:46,572
>> HE'S GOT THE DEATH GRIP

848
00:24:46,572 --> 00:24:50,663
ON MY FINGER.

849
00:24:50,663 --> 00:24:52,316
THE NURSES TOLD ME THAT BECAUSE

850
00:24:52,316 --> 00:24:53,622
RYLAN IS PREMATURE,

851
00:24:53,622 --> 00:24:54,797
HE MIGHT HAVE A HARD TIME

852
00:24:54,797 --> 00:24:56,582
LATCHING ON.

853
00:24:56,582 --> 00:24:58,540
SO FOR NOW, I'M PUMPING

854
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,585
BREAST MILK AND FEEDING HIM

855
00:24:59,585 --> 00:25:01,108
WITH A BOTTLE.

856
00:25:01,108 --> 00:25:02,762
BUT I'M GOING TO KEEP TRYING,

857
00:25:02,762 --> 00:25:03,676
BECAUSE I WANT TO BOND

858
00:25:03,676 --> 00:25:04,851
WITH MY BABY.

859
00:25:04,851 --> 00:25:06,548
THAT WAS A LITTLE SUCK.

860
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:07,549
I'M TELLING YOU,

861
00:25:07,549 --> 00:25:11,422
HE'S NOT LATCHING ON.

862
00:25:11,422 --> 00:25:12,119
HERE.

863
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:12,989
MOM, WILL YOU PULL DOWN

864
00:25:12,989 --> 00:25:15,557
MOM, WILL YOU PULL DOWN
HIS BOTTOM LIP?

865
00:25:15,557 --> 00:25:19,039
HIS BOTTOM LIP?

866
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:20,257
THEY SAID IT'S ALSO GOOD, LIKE,

867
00:25:20,257 --> 00:25:22,564
IF HE'S NOT LATCHING ON

868
00:25:22,564 --> 00:25:25,219
AND YOU GOT HIM SKIN TO SKIN

869
00:25:25,219 --> 00:25:26,612
LIKE THIS.

870
00:25:26,612 --> 00:25:28,091
AT LEAST HE KNOWS THAT THAT'S

871
00:25:28,091 --> 00:25:32,139
WHERE IT COMES FROM.

872
00:25:32,139 --> 00:25:33,575
AFTER SCHOOL GOT OUT,

873
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:34,968
MY FRIENDS ALL SHOWED UP

874
00:25:34,968 --> 00:25:36,404
TO SEE RYLAN.

875
00:25:36,404 --> 00:25:38,624
TO SEE RYLAN.
>> OH!

876
00:25:38,624 --> 00:25:46,109
>> OH!

877
00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:47,763
>> YEAH.

878
00:25:47,763 --> 00:25:48,938
>> YOU GET AN EXTRA MONTH

879
00:25:48,938 --> 00:25:50,549
TO GET READY FOR PROM.

880
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,724
[laughter]

881
00:25:51,724 --> 00:25:53,203
>> AFTER MY FRIENDS LEFT,

882
00:25:53,203 --> 00:25:54,857
I WAS EXHAUSTED AND WAS READY

883
00:25:54,857 --> 00:25:57,381
TO GET SOME SLEEP.

884
00:25:57,381 --> 00:25:58,644
>> SEE YA.

885
00:25:58,644 --> 00:26:01,429
[Rylan crying]

886
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:02,952
>> BUT SLEEP ISN'T REALLY

887
00:26:02,952 --> 00:26:06,129
>> BUT SLEEP ISN'T REALLY
AN OPTION WITH A NEWBORN.

888
00:26:06,129 --> 00:26:11,787
AN OPTION WITH A NEWBORN.

889
00:26:11,787 --> 00:26:12,788
>> TODAY WE FINALLY GET

890
00:26:12,788 --> 00:26:14,442
TO TAKE MY BABY BOY HOME,

891
00:26:14,442 --> 00:26:15,574
AND I'M SO HAPPY

892
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,053
BUT SCARED OF HAVING TO DO

893
00:26:17,053 --> 00:26:18,664
EVERYTHING BY MYSELF

894
00:26:18,664 --> 00:26:19,969
WITHOUT THE NURSES' HELP.

895
00:26:19,969 --> 00:26:20,796
>> OKAY, RYLAN,

896
00:26:20,796 --> 00:26:22,711
WE'RE ON OUR WAY HOME!

897
00:26:22,711 --> 00:26:23,930
KAYLA, IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE

898
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:24,974
NO TIME AGO WHEN WE WERE

899
00:26:24,974 --> 00:26:26,323
TRAVELING THIS SAME ROAD

900
00:26:26,323 --> 00:26:28,282
TO TAKE YOU HOME.

901
00:26:28,282 --> 00:26:29,979
>> WE AT HOME, BIG MAN.

902
00:26:29,979 --> 00:26:31,764
>> HOME, SWEET HOME.

903
00:26:31,764 --> 00:26:33,243
>> LOOK, RYLAN.

904
00:26:33,243 --> 00:26:34,984
HERE'S YOUR ROOM.

905
00:26:34,984 --> 00:26:36,769
>> SHOW HIM HIS LITTLE BED.

906
00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:38,248
YOU CAN LAY HIM IN IT?

907
00:26:38,248 --> 00:26:39,598
>> THANK GOODNESS MY MOM HAS

908
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:40,729
EXPERIENCE WITH BABIES

909
00:26:40,729 --> 00:26:43,645
EXPERIENCE WITH BABIES
AND IS HAPPY TO HELP.

910
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:50,130
AND IS HAPPY TO HELP.

911
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,654
>> I HOPE HE LEARNS TO LATCH ON.

912
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:53,786
>> YEAH, ME TOO.

913
00:26:53,786 --> 00:26:55,004
>> SINCE RYLAN IS NOT

914
00:26:55,004 --> 00:26:56,615
LATCHING ON, I'M ALREADY

915
00:26:56,615 --> 00:26:57,790
SPENDING A LOT OF TIME

916
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:59,008
ATTACHED TO THIS PUMP.

917
00:26:59,008 --> 00:27:00,836
I REALLY HOPE HE GETS THE HANG

918
00:27:00,836 --> 00:27:02,403
OF BREAST-FEEDING SOON.

919
00:27:02,403 --> 00:27:03,665
>> WHAT Y'ALL DOING?

920
00:27:03,665 --> 00:27:05,014
>> WE WAS TRYING TO GET HIM

921
00:27:05,014 --> 00:27:06,842
TO EAT.

922
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:08,496
>> HE DIDN'T EAT MUCH, DID HE?

923
00:27:08,496 --> 00:27:09,453
>> YOU'VE ALREADY FALLEN

924
00:27:09,453 --> 00:27:13,370
IN LOVE WITH HIM, HAVEN'T YOU?

925
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:14,894
>> NOW THAT I GOT HIM,

926
00:27:14,894 --> 00:27:17,548
I JUST DON'T WANT TO LEAVE HIM.

927
00:27:17,548 --> 00:27:19,202
I CAN'T HELP BUT LOVE HIM.

928
00:27:19,202 --> 00:27:20,377
>> YOU'RE GOING BACK TO WORK,

929
00:27:20,377 --> 00:27:21,030
J.R.?

930
00:27:21,030 --> 00:27:21,770
>> YEAH, I GOT TO.

931
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:22,902
I CAN'T AFFORD TO MISS

932
00:27:22,902 --> 00:27:23,554
ANY MORE WORK.

933
00:27:23,554 --> 00:27:24,381
>> ARE YOU TAKING OFF

934
00:27:24,381 --> 00:27:25,121
NEXT WEEK?

935
00:27:25,121 --> 00:27:25,818
>> I DON'T KNOW.

936
00:27:25,818 --> 00:27:26,862
WHAT DO YOU THINK

937
00:27:26,862 --> 00:27:27,515
WE NEED TO DO?

938
00:27:27,515 --> 00:27:28,821
>> YEAH, YOU NEED TO TAKE OFF.

939
00:27:28,821 --> 00:27:29,648
>> YOU THINK I NEED

940
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:31,214
TO BE HERE ALL WEEK NEXT WEEK?

941
00:27:31,214 --> 00:27:31,780
>> YEAH.

942
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:32,912
WHAT AM I GOING TO DO,

943
00:27:32,912 --> 00:27:33,826
BE HERE BY MYSELF?

944
00:27:33,826 --> 00:27:35,044
>> WHY ARE YOU SCARED, KAYLA,

945
00:27:35,044 --> 00:27:36,350
TO BE HERE BY YOURSELF?

946
00:27:36,350 --> 00:27:37,743
>> BECAUSE I'VE, LIKE,

947
00:27:37,743 --> 00:27:39,658
NEVER DONE THIS BY MYSELF.

948
00:27:39,658 --> 00:27:40,746
>> BUT YOU ARE DOING

949
00:27:40,746 --> 00:27:41,660
AN EXCELLENT JOB.

950
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:43,923
>> OH, WELL, BUT WITH HIM

951
00:27:43,923 --> 00:27:45,011
BEING LITTLE, I DON'T WANT

952
00:27:45,011 --> 00:27:46,665
TO REALLY TAKE HIM OUT

953
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:48,101
OF THE HOUSE MUCH.

954
00:27:48,101 --> 00:27:49,015
>> YOU THINK THAT'S GOING

955
00:27:49,015 --> 00:27:50,407
TO BE HARD, GOING BACK

956
00:27:50,407 --> 00:27:51,844
AND FORTH BETWEEN HERE

957
00:27:51,844 --> 00:27:54,934
AND DOWN TO PAM AND GLENN'S?

958
00:27:54,934 --> 00:27:55,717
>> WE HAVEN'T, LIKE,

959
00:27:55,717 --> 00:27:56,892
REALLY DISCUSSED IT,

960
00:27:56,892 --> 00:27:58,415
BUT IS IT OKAY

961
00:27:58,415 --> 00:28:00,548
IF J.R. STAYS WITH US?

962
00:28:00,548 --> 00:28:01,897
>> YEAH, HE CAN STAY

963
00:28:01,897 --> 00:28:03,116
AS LONG AS HE STAYS

964
00:28:03,116 --> 00:28:04,204
IN THE OTHER ROOM

965
00:28:04,204 --> 00:28:05,684
AND Y'ALL DON'T GET UP

966
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:06,641
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

967
00:28:06,641 --> 00:28:07,903
AND VISIT EACH OTHER'S BEDROOMS

968
00:28:07,903 --> 00:28:09,035
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

969
00:28:09,035 --> 00:28:09,949
>> OH, MY GOSH.

970
00:28:09,949 --> 00:28:10,732
>> NO, WE DON'T WANT

971
00:28:10,732 --> 00:28:11,646
NO MORE KIDS.

972
00:28:11,646 --> 00:28:12,734
>> NO MORE BABIES.

973
00:28:12,734 --> 00:28:14,475
>> J.R.'S FAMILY WAS FINE

974
00:28:14,475 --> 00:28:15,650
WITH THAT PLAN TOO,

975
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:16,738
BUT WHILE HE GETS TO SLEEP

976
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:18,609
SOUNDLY IN THE OTHER ROOM,

977
00:28:18,609 --> 00:28:20,133
I HAVE TO GET UP ALL NIGHT

978
00:28:20,133 --> 00:28:22,701
I HAVE TO GET UP ALL NIGHT
WITH THE BABY.

979
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,877
WITH THE BABY.

980
00:28:24,877 --> 00:28:28,794
[Rylan crying]

981
00:28:28,794 --> 00:28:32,362
>> OKAY, RYLAN.

982
00:28:32,362 --> 00:28:33,712
SLEEP WITH MOMMY

983
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:36,932
SLEEP WITH MOMMY
FOR A LITTLE BIT.

984
00:28:36,932 --> 00:28:40,936
FOR A LITTLE BIT.

985
00:28:40,936 --> 00:28:44,026
[Rylan crying]

986
00:28:44,026 --> 00:28:47,464
[Rylan crying]
LET MOMMY GET YOU A BOTTLE.

987
00:28:47,464 --> 00:28:52,078
LET MOMMY GET YOU A BOTTLE.

988
00:28:52,078 --> 00:28:54,471
LET MOMMY GET YOU A BOTTLE.
SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH.

989
00:28:54,471 --> 00:29:03,785
SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH.

990
00:29:03,785 --> 00:29:04,873
>> I'M GOING TO WORK.

991
00:29:04,873 --> 00:29:07,746
>> I'M GOING TO WORK.
>> OKAY.

992
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:11,880
>> OKAY.

993
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,229
IT'S BEEN A WEEK, AND RYLAN'S

994
00:29:13,229 --> 00:29:15,884
STILL NOT LATCHING ON.

995
00:29:15,884 --> 00:29:16,929
SO I'M STILL PUMPING

996
00:29:16,929 --> 00:29:18,713
AND FEEDING HIM WITH A BOTTLE.

997
00:29:18,713 --> 00:29:19,801
I LOVE BEING A MOM,

998
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:23,805
BUT IT'S HARDER THAN I THOUGHT.

999
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:26,939
BUT IT'S HARDER THAN I THOUGHT.
HOW MUCH DID HE EAT?

1000
00:29:26,939 --> 00:29:32,205
HOW MUCH DID HE EAT?

1001
00:29:32,205 --> 00:29:32,988
WHY DON'T YOU GO GET

1002
00:29:32,988 --> 00:29:34,685
MY PUMPER THINGS

1003
00:29:34,685 --> 00:29:36,731
AND SOME BOTTLES?

1004
00:29:36,731 --> 00:29:40,126
>> THERE'S ONLY THREE OF THESE.

1005
00:29:40,126 --> 00:29:41,997
THE OTHER ONES ARE IN THE SINK.

1006
00:29:41,997 --> 00:29:43,172
THESE WERE IN THE SINK TOO.

1007
00:29:43,172 --> 00:29:45,914
THESE WERE IN THE SINK TOO.
>> DID YOU WASH THEM OUT?

1008
00:29:45,914 --> 00:29:58,753
>> DID YOU WASH THEM OUT?

1009
00:29:58,753 --> 00:29:59,798
I LOVE BEING A MOM,

1010
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:00,973
BUT J.R. DOESN'T GET

1011
00:30:00,973 --> 00:30:02,626
WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH.

1012
00:30:02,626 --> 00:30:03,627
WITH J.R. WORKING

1013
00:30:03,627 --> 00:30:05,020
AND BOTH OF US EXHAUSTED

1014
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:05,934
TRYING TO TAKE CARE

1015
00:30:05,934 --> 00:30:07,022
OF THIS BABY,

1016
00:30:07,022 --> 00:30:07,893
EVEN THE SIMPLEST THINGS

1017
00:30:07,893 --> 00:30:12,332
EVEN THE SIMPLEST THINGS
CAN SEEM IMPOSSIBLY HARD.

1018
00:30:12,332 --> 00:30:14,421
CAN SEEM IMPOSSIBLY HARD.

1019
00:30:14,421 --> 00:30:15,944
EVEN THOUGH I SAID I WOULD ONLY

1020
00:30:15,944 --> 00:30:18,033
TAKE TWO WEEKS OFF FROM SCHOOL,

1021
00:30:18,033 --> 00:30:19,078
I'M NOT READY TO LEAVE RYLAN

1022
00:30:19,078 --> 00:30:20,514
AND GO BACK.

1023
00:30:20,514 --> 00:30:22,603
>> COME WITH ME, BIG BOY.

1024
00:30:22,603 --> 00:30:24,474
>> I'M TIRED.

1025
00:30:24,474 --> 00:30:25,998
>> YOU GOING TO TRY TO GET

1026
00:30:25,998 --> 00:30:28,478
A GOOD NIGHT'S REST TONIGHT?

1027
00:30:28,478 --> 00:30:30,306
>> I'LL TRY.

1028
00:30:30,306 --> 00:30:31,699
I'LL PROBABLY BE UP ANYWAY,

1029
00:30:31,699 --> 00:30:32,613
'CAUSE I HAVE TO CHECK

1030
00:30:32,613 --> 00:30:33,875
AND MAKE SURE HE'S BREATHING

1031
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,442
EVERY NOW AND THEN

1032
00:30:35,442 --> 00:30:37,009
WHEN HE'S BEING TOO QUIET.

1033
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:38,314
>> YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RELAX

1034
00:30:38,314 --> 00:30:39,576
ABOUT ALL THAT.

1035
00:30:39,576 --> 00:30:40,926
>> I CAN'T.

1036
00:30:40,926 --> 00:30:41,840
>> ARE YOU STILL PLANNING

1037
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,710
ON GOING BACK TO SCHOOL?

1038
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,580
>> I'D LIKE TO GET BACK

1039
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:46,975
PRETTY SOON, BUT HIM BEING

1040
00:30:46,975 --> 00:30:48,107
PREEMIE, I DON'T REALLY

1041
00:30:48,107 --> 00:30:50,457
WANT HIM TO BE

1042
00:30:50,457 --> 00:30:52,111
WITH ANYBODY ELSE.

1043
00:30:52,111 --> 00:30:53,025
>> YOU'VE GOT TO GO BACK

1044
00:30:53,025 --> 00:30:54,069
TO SCHOOL AND FINISH.

1045
00:30:54,069 --> 00:30:55,505
YOU'VE ONLY GOT A FEW MONTHS.

1046
00:30:55,505 --> 00:30:57,159
>> BUT I JUST WANT TO DO

1047
00:30:57,159 --> 00:30:58,508
WHAT'S BEST FOR HIM.

1048
00:30:58,508 --> 00:30:59,858
I TRUST MYSELF BETTER

1049
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,816
THAN SOMEBODY THAT HASN'T HAD

1050
00:31:01,816 --> 00:31:05,037
A SMALL BABY IN A WHILE.

1051
00:31:05,037 --> 00:31:06,560
BEFORE I HAD THE BABY,

1052
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,258
MY TOP PRIORITY WAS TO GRADUATE.

1053
00:31:09,258 --> 00:31:10,912
BUT BEING A MOM DOESN'T LEAVE

1054
00:31:10,912 --> 00:31:13,872
BUT BEING A MOM DOESN'T LEAVE
MUCH ROOM FOR ANYTHING ELSE.

1055
00:31:13,872 --> 00:31:21,270
MUCH ROOM FOR ANYTHING ELSE.

1056
00:31:21,270 --> 00:31:22,706
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE A MONTH

1057
00:31:22,706 --> 00:31:24,143
HAS ALREADY PASSED.

1058
00:31:24,143 --> 00:31:25,709
I HAVEN'T GONE BACK TO SCHOOL,

1059
00:31:25,709 --> 00:31:26,623
BUT MY FRIENDS HAVE BEEN

1060
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:27,537
VISITING.

1061
00:31:27,537 --> 00:31:28,364
HEY.

1062
00:31:28,364 --> 00:31:29,104
>> HEY, SUNSHINE.

1063
00:31:29,104 --> 00:31:30,062
WHEN DO YOU THINK YOU'LL BE

1064
00:31:30,062 --> 00:31:30,889
COMING BACK TO SCHOOL?

1065
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,020
>> YOU GET A SIX-WEEK

1066
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,021
MATERNITY LEAVE,

1067
00:31:33,021 --> 00:31:33,935
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

1068
00:31:33,935 --> 00:31:34,805
>> 'CAUSE I KEEP LOOKING

1069
00:31:34,805 --> 00:31:36,024
AT HER, AND WE'RE LIKE,

1070
00:31:36,024 --> 00:31:37,025
"WHERE'S KAYLA?"

1071
00:31:37,025 --> 00:31:38,548
KAYLA'S NOT HERE.

1072
00:31:38,548 --> 00:31:39,506
KAYLA'S NOT GOING TO BE HERE

1073
00:31:39,506 --> 00:31:40,115
TODAY.

1074
00:31:40,115 --> 00:31:41,595
>> RIGHT NOW, I GOT

1075
00:31:41,595 --> 00:31:44,163
THE NEW MOMMY THING GOING ON.

1076
00:31:44,163 --> 00:31:45,729
SAY, "I LOVE IT."

1077
00:31:45,729 --> 00:31:46,861
SAY, "I'M ALL THAT MATTERS

1078
00:31:46,861 --> 00:31:47,993
RIGHT NOW."

1079
00:31:47,993 --> 00:31:51,648
YEAH.

1080
00:31:51,648 --> 00:31:52,998
SINCE I'VE BEEN SPENDING

1081
00:31:52,998 --> 00:31:54,390
SO MUCH TIME AT HOME,

1082
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,565
I'VE DECIDED I WANT

1083
00:31:55,565 --> 00:31:57,132
TO TAKE RYLAN RIDING.

1084
00:31:57,132 --> 00:31:59,091
J.R. THINKS IT'S A BAD IDEA,

1085
00:31:59,091 --> 00:32:01,006
BUT I WANT MY SON GROWING UP

1086
00:32:01,006 --> 00:32:02,268
KNOWING HOW TO RIDE.

1087
00:32:02,268 --> 00:32:03,443
>> HOW YOU GOING TO HOLD ON

1088
00:32:03,443 --> 00:32:05,445
TO HIM AND RIDE THAT HORSE

1089
00:32:05,445 --> 00:32:07,055
AT THE SAME TIME?

1090
00:32:07,055 --> 00:32:08,143
>> THIS IS HOLDING ON TO HIM.

1091
00:32:08,143 --> 00:32:09,318
>> HOW YOU GOING TO KEEP

1092
00:32:09,318 --> 00:32:10,406
HIS HEAD FROM--

1093
00:32:10,406 --> 00:32:14,149
>> I CAN--

1094
00:32:14,149 --> 00:32:15,890
ONE, TWO, THREE.

1095
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:18,284
>> EASY.

1096
00:32:18,284 --> 00:32:19,415
>> OKAY.

1097
00:32:19,415 --> 00:32:21,026
>> OKAY.

1098
00:32:21,026 --> 00:32:22,288
>> BE A GOOD GIRL.

1099
00:32:22,288 --> 00:32:24,246
YOU GOT MY LITTLE SON ON THERE.

1100
00:32:24,246 --> 00:32:25,813
YOU BE A GOOD HORSE, OKAY?

1101
00:32:25,813 --> 00:32:26,988
>> ALL RIGHT, READY?

1102
00:32:26,988 --> 00:32:27,989
>> YEAH.

1103
00:32:27,989 --> 00:32:31,297
>> YEAH.
COME ON.

1104
00:32:31,297 --> 00:32:36,998
COME ON.

1105
00:32:36,998 --> 00:32:39,783
COME ON.
>> GOT HER?

1106
00:32:39,783 --> 00:32:42,830
>> GOT HER?

1107
00:32:42,830 --> 00:32:44,092
>> NOPE.

1108
00:32:44,092 --> 00:32:45,964
NO.

1109
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,008
>> I KNOW.

1110
00:32:47,008 --> 00:32:48,227
I KNOW.

1111
00:32:48,227 --> 00:32:50,142
HANG ON.

1112
00:32:50,142 --> 00:32:51,578
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1113
00:32:51,578 --> 00:32:52,709
I'M GETTING ILL.

1114
00:32:52,709 --> 00:32:54,059
JUST STOP FOR A MINUTE.

1115
00:32:54,059 --> 00:32:55,147
>> WELL, GIVE ME RYLAN

1116
00:32:55,147 --> 00:32:58,019
>> WELL, GIVE ME RYLAN
AND JUST GET OFF.

1117
00:32:58,019 --> 00:33:00,979
AND JUST GET OFF.

1118
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,241
>> HERE'S HIS PACI.

1119
00:33:02,241 --> 00:33:03,590
I GOT IT.

1120
00:33:03,590 --> 00:33:06,158
>> ALL RIGHT, BEAUTIFUL.

1121
00:33:06,158 --> 00:33:07,811
>> EVER SINCE HE WENT BACK

1122
00:33:07,811 --> 00:33:10,031
TO WORK, J.R. AND I HAVE NOT HAD

1123
00:33:10,031 --> 00:33:11,598
MUCH TIME TO COMMUNICATE.

1124
00:33:11,598 --> 00:33:12,425
BUT HE'S BEEN SPENDING

1125
00:33:12,425 --> 00:33:13,208
HIS WEEKENDS

1126
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:14,862
FIXING UP THE HOUSE FOR US,

1127
00:33:14,862 --> 00:33:16,081
SO I KNOW WE'RE GOING

1128
00:33:16,081 --> 00:33:18,735
SO I KNOW WE'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO TALK SOON.

1129
00:33:18,735 --> 00:33:26,526
TO HAVE TO TALK SOON.

1130
00:33:26,526 --> 00:33:27,483
BUT I WANT TO MOVE

1131
00:33:27,483 --> 00:33:28,484
INTO THIS HOUSE

1132
00:33:28,484 --> 00:33:30,965
SOMEDAY REALLY SOON.

1133
00:33:30,965 --> 00:33:32,793
COME HERE, BABY BOY.

1134
00:33:32,793 --> 00:33:34,055
>> I MEAN, I THINK

1135
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:35,013
IT'S REALLY NICE,

1136
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,797
AND IT'LL BE A GREAT LITTLE

1137
00:33:36,797 --> 00:33:39,365
HOUSE FOR ME AND--

1138
00:33:39,365 --> 00:33:41,889
ME, YOU, AND RYLAN.

1139
00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:44,544
BUT I THINK THERE'S MORE--

1140
00:33:44,544 --> 00:33:45,849
LIKE, MORE STUFF WE NEED

1141
00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:46,807
TO TALK ABOUT.

1142
00:33:46,807 --> 00:33:48,330
WE NEED TO START TALKING

1143
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:50,158
ABOUT HOW OUR FUTURE'S

1144
00:33:50,158 --> 00:33:51,986
GOING TO BE AND EVERYTHING.

1145
00:33:51,986 --> 00:33:53,292
IT'S OBVIOUS

1146
00:33:53,292 --> 00:33:54,728
THERE'S LOTS TO DISCUSS,

1147
00:33:54,728 --> 00:33:56,643
SO WE DECIDED TO GO BACK

1148
00:33:56,643 --> 00:33:58,036
TO MY HOUSE AND PUT THE BABY

1149
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,211
TO BED BEFORE WE TRY

1150
00:33:59,211 --> 00:34:00,690
TO FIGURE THINGS OUT.

1151
00:34:00,690 --> 00:34:02,214
I DON'T THINK YOU REALIZE

1152
00:34:02,214 --> 00:34:03,389
HOW TOUGH IT IS GOING TO BE,

1153
00:34:03,389 --> 00:34:04,651
RAISING THE BABY.

1154
00:34:04,651 --> 00:34:06,131
>> I DON'T WANT US TO HAVE TO

1155
00:34:06,131 --> 00:34:07,306
DEPEND ON OUR PARENTS FOREVER

1156
00:34:07,306 --> 00:34:08,263
EITHER.

1157
00:34:08,263 --> 00:34:09,264
>> WELL, WE'RE NOT,

1158
00:34:09,264 --> 00:34:11,092
BUT WE'RE LUCKY TO HAVE

1159
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:12,267
THE SUPPORT WE HAVE.

1160
00:34:12,267 --> 00:34:13,225
>> OH, I KNOW.

1161
00:34:13,225 --> 00:34:15,009
BUT IT AIN'T THEIR JOB

1162
00:34:15,009 --> 00:34:16,837
TO SUPPORT US AND TAKE CARE

1163
00:34:16,837 --> 00:34:18,665
OF US AND OUR BABY.

1164
00:34:18,665 --> 00:34:20,449
YOU KNOW, IT'S OUR JOB.

1165
00:34:20,449 --> 00:34:22,190
I WOULD LIKE TO MOVE.

1166
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:23,931
>> YEAH, BUT I'M NOT GOING

1167
00:34:23,931 --> 00:34:27,369
TO BE SUPERMOM ALL BY MYSELF.

1168
00:34:27,369 --> 00:34:29,371
>> I FEEL BAD, BECAUSE THEY'RE

1169
00:34:29,371 --> 00:34:31,156
DOING IT IN MY PLACE,

1170
00:34:31,156 --> 00:34:33,984
WHEREAS I SHOULD BE DOING IT.

1171
00:34:33,984 --> 00:34:36,378
>> SO IS IT A PRIDE THING?

1172
00:34:36,378 --> 00:34:38,119
>> IT'S NOT PRIDE, BUT I WANT

1173
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:39,947
TO SUPPORT MY FAMILY.

1174
00:34:39,947 --> 00:34:41,122
I KNOW OUR PARENTS ARE GOING

1175
00:34:41,122 --> 00:34:43,081
TO HELP US EVERY WHICH WAY

1176
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,909
POSSIBLE, BUT I JUST DON'T

1177
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:49,043
WANT THAT FOREVER.

1178
00:34:49,043 --> 00:34:50,392
>> WELL, I MEAN,

1179
00:34:50,392 --> 00:34:53,134
I'M NOT MOVING.

1180
00:34:53,134 --> 00:34:57,356
THAT'S JUST IT.

1181
00:34:57,356 --> 00:34:58,313
I HAVE TO DO WHAT I THINK

1182
00:34:58,313 --> 00:35:00,272
IS BEST FOR ME AND THE BABY,

1183
00:35:00,272 --> 00:35:01,447
REGARDLESS OF WHAT IT MEANS

1184
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:03,144
FOR J.R. AND I.

1185
00:35:03,144 --> 00:35:04,145
WE'RE JUST NOT READY

1186
00:35:04,145 --> 00:35:07,105
WE'RE JUST NOT READY
TO DO THIS ON OUR OWN.

1187
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:21,119
TO DO THIS ON OUR OWN.

1188
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,121
>> WITH J.R. AND I'S PLANS

1189
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:24,383
TO MOVE IN TOGETHER ON HOLD,

1190
00:35:24,383 --> 00:35:25,340
I'M TRYING TO GET BACK

1191
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:28,213
INTO THE SWING OF MY OLD LIFE.

1192
00:35:28,213 --> 00:35:29,562
BUT EVEN THOUGH I DON'T WANT

1193
00:35:29,562 --> 00:35:30,389
TO LEAVE RYLAN

1194
00:35:30,389 --> 00:35:31,999

TO SCHOOL IF I WANT TO GRADUATE

1199
00:35:36,699 --> 00:35:38,092
ON TIME.

1200
00:35:38,092 --> 00:35:39,267
>> HOW'S THINGS BEEN?

1201
00:35:39,267 --> 00:35:40,268
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M GOING

1202
00:35:40,268 --> 00:35:42,227
TO SCHOOL NEXT WEEK.

1203
00:35:42,227 --> 00:35:42,879
>> YOU ARE?

A SOCIAL LIFE.

1208

TO LEAVE HIM.

00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:39,491
THAT YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON,

1302
00:38:39,491 --> 00:38:40,448
IT'S NOT.

1303
00:38:40,448 --> 00:38:41,493
>> BUT I DIDN'T HAVE

1304
00:38:41,493 --> 00:38:42,407
THAT CHOICE.

1305
00:38:42,407 --> 00:38:43,625
>> I WANT TO BE YOUR HUSBAND,

1306
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:45,410
AND I WANT TO PROVIDE

1307
00:38:45,410 --> 00:38:46,411
FOR YOU AND RYLAN,

1308
00:38:46,411 --> 00:38:47,368
AND I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO

1309
00:38:47,368 --> 00:38:48,282
DEPEND ON YOUR MOM AND DAD

1310
00:38:48,282 --> 00:38:49,022
FOREVER.

1311
00:38:49,022 --> 00:38:51,590
IT MAKES ME FEEL LOW SOMETIMES

1312
00:38:51,590 --> 00:38:54,332
FOR YOUR MOM TO HAVE TO GO

1313
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,682
BUY HIM FORMULA OR SOMETHING.

1314
00:38:56,682 --> 00:38:59,075
I MEAN, I WANT TO FEEL LIKE

1315
00:38:59,075 --> 00:39:02,122
I'M PROVIDING FOR YOU AND HIM.

1316
00:39:02,122 --> 00:39:03,515
IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME.

1317
00:39:03,515 --> 00:39:05,604
>> IF I WOULDN'T HAVE HAD

1318
00:39:05,604 --> 00:39:07,997
RYLAN, WOULD YOU STILL WANT

1319
00:39:07,997 --> 00:39:09,608
TO MARRY ME?

1320
00:39:09,608 --> 00:39:10,913
>> OF COURSE.

1321
00:39:10,913 --> 00:39:12,001
>> I DON'T WANT TO FEEL,

1322
00:39:12,001 --> 00:39:13,089
ON MY WEDDING DAY,

1323
00:39:13,089 --> 00:39:15,657
THAT I'M JUST GETTING MARRIED

1324
00:39:15,657 --> 00:39:17,137
BECAUSE WE HAD A BABY.

1325
00:39:17,137 --> 00:39:17,964
>> I WANT TO MARRY YOU

1326
00:39:17,964 --> 00:39:18,834
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU

1327
00:39:18,834 --> 00:39:19,835
AND I WANT TO SPEND THE REST

1328
00:39:19,835 --> 00:39:21,489
OF MY LIFE WITH YOU.

1329
00:39:21,489 --> 00:39:22,925
I DON'T WANT YOU TO PUT IT OFF

1330
00:39:22,925 --> 00:39:25,450
AND JUST KEEP PUTTING IT OFF

1331
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:26,755
AND OFF AND OFF.

1332
00:39:26,755 --> 00:39:27,800
THAT'S WHAT I'M SCARED OF,

1333
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,323
IS THAT YOU'RE DOING IT

1334
00:39:29,323 --> 00:39:30,411
'CAUSE YOU'RE SCARED

1335
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:32,413
OF BEING WITH ME.

1336
00:39:32,413 --> 00:39:33,458
>> NO, I MEAN, I THINK

1337
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:35,503
OUR RELATIONSHIP STILL NEEDS

1338
00:39:35,503 --> 00:39:38,550
SOME WORK, BUT IT'S NOTHING

1339
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:40,769
CLOSE TO ME NOT WANTING

1340
00:39:40,769 --> 00:39:43,642
CLOSE TO ME NOT WANTING
TO BE WITH YOU.

1341
00:39:43,642 --> 00:39:47,123
TO BE WITH YOU.

1342
00:39:47,123 --> 00:39:49,212
I DON'T THINK THAT ME AND J.R.

1343
00:39:49,212 --> 00:39:51,563
WERE READY TO BECOME PARENTS.

1344
00:39:51,563 --> 00:39:54,174
WE STILL NEEDED SOME MORE TIME

1345
00:39:54,174 --> 00:39:57,264
FOR OUR RELATIONSHIP TO GROW.

1346
00:39:57,264 --> 00:39:59,832
AND I'M GLAD THAT I TOLD J.R.

1347
00:39:59,832 --> 00:40:01,181
THAT I WASN'T READY

1348
00:40:01,181 --> 00:40:02,704
TO GET MARRIED RIGHT NOW,

1349
00:40:02,704 --> 00:40:04,706
BECAUSE MARRIAGE IS NOT

1350
00:40:04,706 --> 00:40:05,577
SOMETHING I'M READY

1351
00:40:05,577 --> 00:40:07,492
TO RUSH INTO.

1352
00:40:07,492 --> 00:40:08,710
HEY!

1353
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:09,668
>> HEY, BABY DOLL.

1354
00:40:09,668 --> 00:40:11,713
>> MY MOM HELPS ME SO MUCH,

1355
00:40:11,713 --> 00:40:13,019
AND RIGHT NOW, I COULD NOT

1356
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:14,716
IMAGINE DOING ANY OF IT

1357
00:40:14,716 --> 00:40:16,152
WITHOUT HER.

1358
00:40:16,152 --> 00:40:18,328
WHEN I HAD UNPROTECTED SEX,

1359
00:40:18,328 --> 00:40:20,679
I REALLY WISH I WOULD HAVE

1360
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:22,420
THOUGHT IT THROUGH MORE,

1361
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,812
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I HAD

1362
00:40:23,812 --> 00:40:25,118
ALL THE LOVE AND SUPPORT

1363
00:40:25,118 --> 00:40:26,206
IN THE WORLD,

1364
00:40:26,206 --> 00:40:27,686
THE EMOTIONAL STRUGGLE

1365
00:40:27,686 --> 00:40:29,296
THAT YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH

1366
00:40:29,296 --> 00:40:30,732
ALONG WITH BEING PREGNANT

1367
00:40:30,732 --> 00:40:33,300
IS REALLY, REALLY HARD.

1368
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:35,084
AND I JUST WANT TO SLOW DOWN

1369
00:40:35,084 --> 00:40:36,695
MY LIFE A LITTLE BIT.

1370
00:40:36,695 --> 00:40:39,306
I WANT TO FINISH OUT

1371
00:40:39,306 --> 00:40:41,526
MY SENIOR YEAR AND GRADUATE

1372
00:40:41,526 --> 00:40:43,310
AND ENJOY THE SUMMER

1373
00:40:43,310 --> 00:40:45,617
AND THEN, YOU KNOW, SEE

1374
00:40:45,617 --> 00:40:48,707
AND THEN, YOU KNOW, SEE
WHERE THE REST GOES.

1375
00:40:48,707 --> 00:40:49,621
WHERE THE REST GOES.

1379
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:07,290
>> IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY

1380
00:41:07,290 --> 00:41:08,291
TO TAKE CARE OF A BABY

1381
00:41:08,291 --> 00:41:10,772
WITH A CONTROLLER IN YOUR HAND.

1382
00:41:10,772 --> 00:41:11,599
>> IT'S HEARTBREAKING.

1383
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:13,514
YOU GUYS CAN'T BE KIDS ANYMORE.

1384
00:41:13,514 --> 00:41:14,646
>> I THINK ONCE THE BABY COMES,

1385
00:41:14,646 --> 00:41:16,517
>> I THINK ONCE THE BABY COMES,
NATHAN'S GONNA SPLIT.

1386
00:41:16,517 --> 00:41:20,695
NATHAN'S GONNA SPLIT.

1387
00:41:20,695 --> 00:41:21,653
>> YOU NEED TO LAY OFF THE VIDEO

1388
00:41:21,653 --> 00:41:24,699
GAMES AND CHANGE MORE DIAPERS.

1389
00:41:24,699 --> 00:41:25,483
YOUR LIVING OFF OF MY DAD'S

1390
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,658
PAYCHECK DOESN'T REALLY

1391
00:41:26,658 --> 00:41:27,223
THRILL ME.

1392
00:41:27,223 --> 00:41:30,009
>> WHAT THE HELL DO YOU WANT
