00:00:05,971 --> 00:00:07,110
HI, I'M MYRANDA.

5
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:08,491
I'M 17, AND I LIVE IN

6
00:00:08,491 --> 00:00:10,424
SAN AUGUSTINE, TEXAS.

7
00:00:10,424 --> 00:00:11,563
I'M AN HONORS STUDENT IN

8
00:00:11,563 --> 00:00:12,771
MY JUNIOR YEAR OF HIGH SCHOOL

9
00:00:12,771 --> 00:00:13,806
AND A SHORTSTOP ON THE

10
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:14,911
SOFTBALL TEAM.

11
00:00:14,911 --> 00:00:16,016
I LOVE PLAYING SPORTS WITH

12
00:00:16,016 --> 00:00:18,087
MY FRIENDS AND GOING TO PARTIES,

13
00:00:18,087 --> 00:00:18,984
AND THAT'S HOW I MET MY

14
00:00:18,984 --> 00:00:20,123
BOYFRIEND, ERIC.

15
00:00:20,123 --> 00:00:21,642
YOU WERE BEING ALL SWEET.

16
00:00:21,642 --> 00:00:23,299
HE HOPES TO PLAY PRO BASEBALL

17
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:24,852
ONE DAY.

18
00:00:24,852 --> 00:00:25,715
MY PARENTS SPLIT UP

19
00:00:25,715 --> 00:00:26,716
WHEN I WAS YOUNG, AND MY MOM

20
00:00:26,716 --> 00:00:27,924
WASN'T AROUND MUCH WHILE I WAS

21
00:00:27,924 --> 00:00:28,683
GROWING UP.

22
00:00:28,683 --> 00:00:29,374
[chime dings]

23
00:00:29,374 --> 00:00:30,271
SHE'S STILL DEALING WITH

24
00:00:30,271 --> 00:00:31,203
SOME PERSONAL PROBLEMS,

25
00:00:31,203 --> 00:00:32,894
SO SHE LET ME MOVE INTO ERIC'S

26
00:00:32,894 --> 00:00:33,895
GRANDMOTHER'S HOUSE AFTER

27
00:00:33,895 --> 00:00:36,519
WE'D BEEN DATING FOR SIX MONTHS.

28
00:00:36,519 --> 00:00:38,176
I REALLY LIKE LIVING WITH HIM,

29
00:00:38,176 --> 00:00:40,040
BUT BEING AROUND HIS GRANDMOTHER

30
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,317
CAN GET ON OUR NERVES.

31
00:00:41,317 --> 00:00:42,732
>> Y'ALL GET UP OUT OF THAT BED.

32
00:00:42,732 --> 00:00:43,974
YOU BETTER MAKE IT UP TOO.

33
00:00:43,974 --> 00:00:44,837
>> I REALLY LOVE ERIC

34
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:45,769
AND HOPE WE'LL BE TOGETHER

35
00:00:45,769 --> 00:00:48,220
FOREVER BECAUSE...

36
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:50,671
FOREVER BECAUSE...
I'M PREGNANT.

37
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:56,849
I'M PREGNANT.

38
00:00:56,849 --> 00:00:58,023
ERIC AND I HAD ONLY BEEN

39
00:00:58,023 --> 00:00:59,507
TOGETHER FOR THREE MONTHS BEFORE

40
00:00:59,507 --> 00:01:01,026
I GOT PREGNANT, BUT WE'RE BOTH

41
00:01:01,026 --> 00:01:02,510
COMMITTED TO OUR RELATIONSHIP.

42
00:01:02,510 --> 00:01:03,166
>> MWAH!

43
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:04,167
>> EVEN THOUGH WE'RE NERVOUS

44
00:01:04,167 --> 00:01:05,686
ABOUT BEING PARENTS, I THINK

45
00:01:05,686 --> 00:01:06,687
WE'LL BE ABLE TO MANAGE

46
00:01:06,687 --> 00:01:07,515
TOGETHER.

47
00:01:07,515 --> 00:01:09,103
>> YOU REMEMBER HOW WE MET?

48
00:01:09,103 --> 00:01:09,931
>> WELL, I REMEMBER

49
00:01:09,931 --> 00:01:11,795
WE WERE IN THE POOL,

50
00:01:11,795 --> 00:01:12,762
AND YOU WERE TRYING TO FLIRT

51
00:01:12,762 --> 00:01:14,695
WITH ME, BUT THEN YOU, LIKE,

52
00:01:14,695 --> 00:01:15,558
THREW ME.

53
00:01:15,558 --> 00:01:17,249
>> AND YOU STARTED LIKING ME.

54
00:01:17,249 --> 00:01:18,837
>> NO, YOU STARTED LIKING ME.

55
00:01:18,837 --> 00:01:19,803
>> NO, IT WAS THE OTHER WAY

56
00:01:19,803 --> 00:01:20,390
AROUND.

00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:21,184
>> [giggles]

58
00:01:21,184 --> 00:01:24,946
>> ARE YOU READY TO HAVE A BABY?

59
00:01:24,946 --> 00:01:25,637
>> NO.

60
00:01:25,637 --> 00:01:26,431
>> TAKE CARE OF IT?

61
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:28,088
>> I'M NOT READY AT ALL.

62
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,434
I'M ONLY 17.

63
00:01:29,434 --> 00:01:31,125
DO YOU THINK YOU'RE READY TO BE

64
00:01:31,125 --> 00:01:31,815
A DADDY?

65
00:01:31,815 --> 00:01:32,540
>> OH, HELL NO.

66
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:33,645
[laughter]

67
00:01:33,645 --> 00:01:34,508
I GET TIRED WATCHING

68
00:01:34,508 --> 00:01:37,511
OTHER PEOPLE'S BABIES, SO...

69
00:01:37,511 --> 00:01:38,546
>> YOU SEE OTHER PEOPLE WITH

70
00:01:38,546 --> 00:01:39,444
BABIES, AND YOU'RE LIKE,

71
00:01:39,444 --> 00:01:40,169
"OH, HOW CUTE."

72
00:01:40,169 --> 00:01:41,273
AND THEN WHENEVER YOU HAVE YOUR

73
00:01:41,273 --> 00:01:42,964
OWN, YOU'RE LIKE, "OH, CRAP."

74
00:01:42,964 --> 00:01:45,346
[laughter]

75
00:01:45,346 --> 00:01:46,485
WE RECENTLY FOUND OUT

76
00:01:46,485 --> 00:01:47,659
WE'RE HAVING A GIRL AND ARE

77
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:49,350
NAMING HER KAYLEE.

78
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,317
WHEN MY MOM FOUND OUT I WAS

79
00:01:50,317 --> 00:01:52,526
PREGNANT, SHE WAS REALLY UPSET.

80
00:01:52,526 --> 00:01:53,734
SHE STRUGGLED WITH ADDICTION

81
00:01:53,734 --> 00:01:55,356
IN THE PAST, SO WE WERE NEVER

82
00:01:55,356 --> 00:01:56,702
REALLY CLOSE WHEN I WAS GROWING

83
00:01:56,702 --> 00:01:58,877
UP, AND BEING PREGNANT ONLY

84
00:01:58,877 --> 00:02:00,879
MAKES VISITING HER MORE AWKWARD.

85
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,191
I'M GONNA GO STAY THE NIGHT

86
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:04,296
I'M GONNA GO STAY THE NIGHT
WITH MOM.

87
00:02:04,296 --> 00:02:06,367
WITH MOM.

88
00:02:06,367 --> 00:02:07,196
>> I DON'T KNOW.

89
00:02:07,196 --> 00:02:09,267
>> I DON'T KNOW.
I GUESS SO.

90
00:02:09,267 --> 00:02:13,167
I GUESS SO.

91
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:14,479
>> I THINK SHE'S BEEN OFF DRUGS,

92
00:02:14,479 --> 00:02:15,652
BUT I DON'T THINK SHE STOPPED

93
00:02:15,652 --> 00:02:18,655
DRINKING.

94
00:02:18,655 --> 00:02:19,656
>> [sighs]

95
00:02:19,656 --> 00:02:21,141
WELL, MAYBE YOU CAN TALK SOME

96
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,072
SENSE INTO HER WHEN YOU

97
00:02:22,072 --> 00:02:22,797
GO DOWN THERE.

98
00:02:22,797 --> 00:02:23,798
>> I'VE TRIED TALKING SENSE

99
00:02:23,798 --> 00:02:26,284
INTO HER SINCE I WAS 12.

100
00:02:26,284 --> 00:02:27,285
>> WELL, MAYBE NOW THAT YOU'RE

101
00:02:27,285 --> 00:02:29,977
PREGNANT, SHE'LL LISTEN.

102
00:02:29,977 --> 00:02:32,462
>> I DOUBT IT.

103
00:02:32,462 --> 00:02:34,533
IF SHE EVER DOES IT AGAIN,

104
00:02:34,533 --> 00:02:36,880
SHE'S NOT GONNA BABYSIT

105
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:39,297
OR ANYTHING.

106
00:02:39,297 --> 00:02:41,816
I CAN'T HAVE MY CHILD

107
00:02:41,816 --> 00:02:43,784
AROUND SOMEBODY WHO DOES

108
00:02:43,784 --> 00:02:46,511
AROUND SOMEBODY WHO DOES
STUFF LIKE THAT.

109
00:02:46,511 --> 00:02:48,823
STUFF LIKE THAT.

110
00:02:48,823 --> 00:02:50,480
MY MOM SAYS SHE'S BEEN SOBER

111
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,481
FOR SEVERAL MONTHS NOW,

112
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:52,689
EVER SINCE HER LAST TIME

113
00:02:52,689 --> 00:02:54,484
IN REHAB, BUT WE HAVEN'T REALLY

114
00:02:54,484 --> 00:02:57,004
DISCUSSED MY PREGNANCY YET.

115
00:02:57,004 --> 00:02:58,143
>> MY FIRST THOUGHTS WERE,

116
00:02:58,143 --> 00:02:59,317
"OH, MY GOD, THAT'S IT."

117
00:02:59,317 --> 00:03:02,285
LIFE'S OVER.

118
00:03:02,285 --> 00:03:03,252
I MEAN, I'M SORRY.

119
00:03:03,252 --> 00:03:04,114
I DON'T WANT TO HURT

120
00:03:04,114 --> 00:03:04,839
YOUR FEELINGS.

121
00:03:04,839 --> 00:03:06,738
I JUST...

122
00:03:06,738 --> 00:03:07,601
I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO BE

123
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:08,602
PREGNANT.

124
00:03:08,602 --> 00:03:10,190
WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS,

125
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,432
WHY WEREN'T YOU TAKING THE PILL?

126
00:03:11,432 --> 00:03:13,158
>> I WAS OFF FOR, LIKE, A MONTH.

127
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:14,263
>> WHAT DID YOU THINK?

128
00:03:14,263 --> 00:03:16,196
YOU WEREN'T GONNA GET PREGNANT?

129
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,749
>> YEAH.

130
00:03:17,749 --> 00:03:19,785
>> [scoffs]

131
00:03:19,785 --> 00:03:20,786
WE HAVEN'T EVEN DISCUSSED

132
00:03:20,786 --> 00:03:22,029
THE FACT ON--ARE WE GONNA

133
00:03:22,029 --> 00:03:23,099
DROP OUT OF SCHOOL

134
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:24,549
AND GO GET A G.E.D.?

135
00:03:24,549 --> 00:03:26,758
>> I'M GONNA GET MY G.E.D.

136
00:03:26,758 --> 00:03:28,691
>> [sighs] MYRANDA...

137
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:30,037
SOMETIMES I WONDER IF IT'S

138
00:03:30,037 --> 00:03:31,038
MY FAULT, BECAUSE I SHOULD

139
00:03:31,038 --> 00:03:32,315
HAVE BEEN A BETTER PARENT.

140
00:03:32,315 --> 00:03:33,834
AS A MOTHER, YOU FEEL LIKE

141
00:03:33,834 --> 00:03:35,629
IT'S...

142
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:36,664
YOU FEEL LIKE IT'S YOUR FAULT,

143
00:03:36,664 --> 00:03:41,324
THAT YOU COULD HAVE DONE MORE.

144
00:03:41,324 --> 00:03:42,498
I THINK I JUST KNOW HOW HARD

145
00:03:42,498 --> 00:03:44,845
IT'S GONNA BE FOR YOU.

146
00:03:44,845 --> 00:03:46,398
>> YEAH.

147
00:03:46,398 --> 00:03:47,296
>> THERE'S NO WAY YOU'RE

148
00:03:47,296 --> 00:03:48,262
GONNA BE ABLE TO GET OUT AND

149
00:03:48,262 --> 00:03:49,401
GET A PLACE AND--WITH YOU

150
00:03:49,401 --> 00:03:50,920
AND THE BABY AND ERIC.

151
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:52,024
NO JOBS.

152
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:53,543
EVERYTHING'S DIFFERENT NOW.

153
00:03:53,543 --> 00:03:54,648
EVERYTHING HAS CHANGED.

154
00:03:54,648 --> 00:03:56,822
NOTHING IS--NOTHING IS HOW

155
00:03:56,822 --> 00:03:59,169
IT USED TO BE.

156
00:03:59,169 --> 00:04:01,724
[sighs]

157
00:04:01,724 --> 00:04:03,035
>> MY MOM ISN'T MAKING THINGS

158
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:04,865
EASIER, AND FINANCES ARE GONNA

159
00:04:04,865 --> 00:04:06,660
BE TIGHT, SO I'M GLAD WE CAN

160
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,868
STAY AT ERIC'S GRANDMOTHER'S

161
00:04:07,868 --> 00:04:08,972
HOUSE.

162
00:04:08,972 --> 00:04:10,284
SHE'S RAISED ERIC SINCE HE WAS

163
00:04:10,284 --> 00:04:11,630
YOUNG AND HAS BEEN LETTING US

164
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,495
LIVE HERE FOR FREE.

165
00:04:14,495 --> 00:04:15,807
I'M HOPING SHE'LL KEEP HELPING

166
00:04:15,807 --> 00:04:17,671
US OUT WHEN THE BABY COMES,

167
00:04:17,671 --> 00:04:18,948
BECAUSE ERIC IS ONLY WORKING

168
00:04:18,948 --> 00:04:20,329
PART-TIME THIS SUMMER

169
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:21,709
AND STARTS HIS COLLEGE CLASSES

170
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:23,918
AND STARTS HIS COLLEGE CLASSES
IN THE FALL.

171
00:04:23,918 --> 00:04:25,886
IN THE FALL.

172
00:04:25,886 --> 00:04:26,921
>> HOW DID YOU GET HER PREGNANT,

173
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:27,957
MAN?

174
00:04:27,957 --> 00:04:28,958
>> I DIDN'T WEAR A CONDOM.

175
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,615
I WAS THINKING WITH MY PENIS.

176
00:04:30,615 --> 00:04:32,099
I DIDN'T CARE.

177
00:04:32,099 --> 00:04:33,100
>> YOU READY FOR THIS BABY

178
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,653
TO COME AND EVERYTHING?

179
00:04:34,653 --> 00:04:35,689

00:04:41,798 --> 00:04:43,835
I GOT $700 SAVED UP RIGHT NOW,

AND AS LONG AS I SAVE UP

187
00:04:44,836 --> 00:04:46,147
EVERY WEEK AFTER I--

188
00:04:46,147 --> 00:04:50,324
ON MY JOB, I SHOULD HAVE PLENTY.

189
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:51,567
>> I FEEL WORTHLESS, 'CAUSE

190
00:04:51,567 --> 00:04:53,534
IT'S, LIKE, I FEEL LIKE I CAN'T

191
00:04:53,534 --> 00:04:55,985
DO NOTHING, EXCEPT FOR LAUNDRY,

192
00:04:55,985 --> 00:04:57,469
AND THEN MY STOMACH'S

193
00:04:57,469 --> 00:04:58,988
IN THE WAY, SO IT'S LIKE--

194
00:04:58,988 --> 00:04:59,989
I CAN'T GET THEM.

195
00:04:59,989 --> 00:05:02,198
I FEEL WORTHLESS.

196
00:05:02,198 --> 00:05:03,199
IT'S HARD.

197
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,339
>> I CAN SEE YOU HAVING A KID.

198
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:06,823
I CAN'T SEE ERIC.

199
00:05:06,823 --> 00:05:07,824
>> THREE!

200
00:05:07,824 --> 00:05:09,032
[laughter]

201
00:05:09,032 --> 00:05:09,826
>> LIKE, RAISING--

202
00:05:09,826 --> 00:05:10,620
>> LIKE, AS A DAD.

203
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,276
>> YEAH.

204
00:05:11,276 --> 00:05:11,966
I DON'T...

205
00:05:11,966 --> 00:05:12,795
>> I DON'T KNOW.

206
00:05:12,795 --> 00:05:13,727
>> I CAN SEE HIM GOING IN

207
00:05:13,727 --> 00:05:14,555
THE ROOM--"MYRANDA!

208
00:05:14,555 --> 00:05:15,487
GET YOUR KID!"

209
00:05:15,487 --> 00:05:17,178
>> [laughs]

210
00:05:17,178 --> 00:05:19,664
I DON'T KNOW.

211
00:05:19,664 --> 00:05:20,837
>> WHAT WAS THE SCARIEST THING

212
00:05:20,837 --> 00:05:21,769
WHEN YOU FOUND OUT YOU WERE

213
00:05:21,769 --> 00:05:23,426
PREGNANT?

214
00:05:23,426 --> 00:05:25,290
>> SCARIEST THING WAS TELLING

215
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:27,292
MY MOM, AND THEN WHENEVER

216
00:05:27,292 --> 00:05:29,121
WE HAD TO TELL NANNY,

217
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,468
THAT WAS PRETTY SCARY.

218
00:05:30,468 --> 00:05:31,365
>> I FIGURED THAT'S WHAT

219
00:05:31,365 --> 00:05:32,677
YOU'D SAY FIRST.

220
00:05:32,677 --> 00:05:34,161
>> MY HEART WAS RACING.

221
00:05:34,161 --> 00:05:36,508
[sighs]

222
00:05:36,508 --> 00:05:38,338
EVER SINCE ERIC'S GRANDMOTHER

223
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,684
FOUND OUT I WAS PREGNANT,

224
00:05:39,684 --> 00:05:41,064
SHE HASN'T BEEN GIVING US

225
00:05:41,064 --> 00:05:42,238
MUCH PRIVACY.

226
00:05:42,238 --> 00:05:44,930
>> WHAT ARE Y'ALL DOING?

227
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:45,931
>> GET OUT.

228
00:05:45,931 --> 00:05:46,967
>> I HOPE THAT'S ALL Y'ALL ARE

229
00:05:46,967 --> 00:05:47,968
DOING, IS WATCHING TV,

230
00:05:47,968 --> 00:05:48,969
BUT I GUESS IT'S A LITTLE BIT

231
00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:50,108
TOO LATE ANYWAY.

232
00:05:50,108 --> 00:05:51,523
>> AND SINCE ERIC WOULD RATHER

233
00:05:51,523 --> 00:05:52,524
PLAY VIDEO GAMES THAN HELP OUT

234
00:05:52,524 --> 00:05:53,870
AROUND THE HOUSE...

235
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,733
>> YOU AIN'T GONNA WASH

236
00:05:54,733 --> 00:05:55,389
THAT DISH.

237
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:56,217
YOU DIDN'T WASH IT.

238
00:05:56,217 --> 00:05:57,046
>> I JUST WASHED IT.

239
00:05:57,046 --> 00:05:57,978
>> YOU JUST RINSED IT OUT.

240
00:05:57,978 --> 00:05:58,875
>> THERE'S A DISHWASHER.

241
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,912
>> NANNY IS ALWAYS ON OUR CASE.

242
00:06:00,912 --> 00:06:03,086
>> WE NEED TO TALK.

243
00:06:03,086 --> 00:06:05,088
WHEN I FIRST FOUND OUT THAT

244
00:06:05,088 --> 00:06:06,987
YOU GUYS WERE PREGNANT...

245
00:06:06,987 --> 00:06:07,781
[sighs]

246
00:06:07,781 --> 00:06:09,230
I WAS SICK.

247
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,542
I FELT LIKE I WAS GONNA

248
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:11,819
THROW UP.

249
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:12,751
IF Y'ALL HADN'T HAVE BEEN

250
00:06:12,751 --> 00:06:15,167
SO DUMB AND STUPID AND WOULD

251
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,169
HAVE USED SOME BIRTH CONTROL--

252
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:18,032
ERIC!

253
00:06:18,032 --> 00:06:18,654
LIKE...

254
00:06:18,654 --> 00:06:19,586
>> WHY AM I SUPPOSED TO BE

255
00:06:19,586 --> 00:06:20,552
THE ONE WITH BIRTH CONTROL?

256
00:06:20,552 --> 00:06:22,312
>> DID I NOT TELL YOU, "ERIC,

257
00:06:22,312 --> 00:06:24,107
MAKE SURE YOU HAVE CONDOMS"?

258
00:06:24,107 --> 00:06:25,454
IT DON'T MATTER IF SHE'S ON

259
00:06:25,454 --> 00:06:26,420
BIRTH CONTROL.

260
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,766
AND MYRANDA, SHE QUIT TAKING

261
00:06:27,766 --> 00:06:29,389
THE STUPID THINGS.

262
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,114
>> I RAN OUT.

263
00:06:31,114 --> 00:06:32,564
AND I MISSED A DAY.

264
00:06:32,564 --> 00:06:34,532
THEN I MISSED SOME MORE DAYS.

265
00:06:34,532 --> 00:06:35,395
>> Y'ALL GOING, "BLAH,

266
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,119
BLAH, BLAH."

267
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:37,466
IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.

268
00:06:37,466 --> 00:06:38,467
YOU TEND TO IT.

269
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:39,399
>> WELL, WE DIDN'T THINK

270
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,710
IT'D HAPPEN.

271
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:42,194
>> [scoffs]

272
00:06:42,194 --> 00:06:44,196
THAT'S--MM.

BOTH OF Y'ALL, MORE OR LESS,

274
00:06:45,888 --> 00:06:48,718
JUST RUINED EACH OTHER'S LIVES.

275
00:06:48,718 --> 00:06:50,202
>> YOU'RE ANNOYING, YOU KNOW...

276
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:51,583
>> I'M ANNOYING.

277
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:52,584
>> YOU'RE ALWAYS NAGGING AT ME

278
00:06:52,584 --> 00:06:53,930
FOR DUMB THINGS.

279
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:57,313
>> YOU HAVE NO IDEA, NO IDEA,

280
00:06:57,313 --> 00:06:58,141
NONE.

281
00:06:58,141 --> 00:06:59,453
>> SEE, THAT'S WHY YOU MAKE ME

282
00:06:59,453 --> 00:07:00,799
MAD SOMETIMES.

283
00:07:00,799 --> 00:07:01,800
YOU SAY YOU KNOW EVERYTHING.

284
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:02,801
>> I KNOW A HECK OF A LOT MORE

285
00:07:02,801 --> 00:07:03,526
THAN YOU KNOW.

286
00:07:03,526 --> 00:07:04,458
OH, Y'ALL THINK Y'ALL KNOW

287
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:05,286
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

288
00:07:05,286 --> 00:07:06,115
AND Y'ALL DON'T KNOW

289
00:07:06,115 --> 00:07:06,978
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

290
00:07:06,978 --> 00:07:07,875
WHERE YOU GONNA LIVE?

00:07:10,395 --> 00:07:13,433
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

294
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:16,228
IT'S NOT GRANDMA DAY CARE.

295
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:18,230
I DONE BEEN THERE, DONE THAT.

296
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:22,511
NO MORE.

297
00:07:22,511 --> 00:07:25,514
BABIES HAVING BABIES.

298
00:07:25,514 --> 00:07:28,068
MM.

299
00:07:28,068 --> 00:07:28,965
[chime dings]

300
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:29,966
>> I REALLY THOUGHT WE WERE

301
00:07:29,966 --> 00:07:31,312
GOING TO BE ABLE TO LIVE HERE

302
00:07:31,312 --> 00:07:32,486
ONCE THE BABY COMES...

303
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:33,625
[door slams]

304
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,731
[door slams]
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE I WAS WRONG.

305
00:07:35,731 --> 00:07:42,738
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE I WAS WRONG.

306
00:07:42,738 --> 00:07:43,739
>> IT REALLY SUCKS THAT

307
00:07:43,739 --> 00:07:44,774
ERIC'S GRANDMOTHER ISN'T GOING

308
00:07:44,774 --> 00:07:46,258
TO LET US LIVE HERE,

309
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:47,432
'CAUSE THE BABY IS DUE IN JUST

310
00:07:47,432 --> 00:07:48,813
TWO MONTHS.

311
00:07:48,813 --> 00:07:50,470
I'D RATHER JUST MOVE SOMEWHERE,

312
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,988
IF WE COULD.

313
00:07:51,988 --> 00:07:53,818
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW

314
00:07:53,818 --> 00:07:55,958
IF WE COULD AFFORD AN APARTMENT,

315
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:58,512
UNLESS WE HAD ROOMMATES.

316
00:07:58,512 --> 00:07:59,513
>> I DON'T WANT ROOMMATES.

317
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:00,203
>> EXACTLY.

318
00:08:00,203 --> 00:08:01,066
SO WE COULDN'T AFFORD

319
00:08:01,066 --> 00:08:02,516
AN APARTMENT.

320
00:08:02,516 --> 00:08:04,587
AN APARTMENT.
>> WHAT ABOUT...

321
00:08:04,587 --> 00:08:14,528
>> WHAT ABOUT...

322
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:15,805
>> HOW MUCH WOULD THE RENT BE?

323
00:08:15,805 --> 00:08:16,737
>> WELL, SHE ACTUALLY SAID

324
00:08:16,737 --> 00:08:17,738
WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY RENT.

325
00:08:17,738 --> 00:08:18,567
WE'D ONLY HAVE TO PAY

326
00:08:18,567 --> 00:08:21,466
THE ELECTRICITY BILL.

327
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:23,192
>> IT'S A BIG STEP,

328
00:08:23,192 --> 00:08:27,645
LIVING ON OUR OWN WITH A BABY.

329
00:08:27,645 --> 00:08:31,165
WE'LL HAVE TO LEARN A WHOLE LOT

330
00:08:31,165 --> 00:08:34,410
THAT WE'RE NOT EVEN READY FOR.

331
00:08:34,410 --> 00:08:36,964
THAT WE'RE NOT EVEN READY FOR.
>> I THINK IT'S OUR BEST BET.

332
00:08:36,964 --> 00:08:41,900
>> I THINK IT'S OUR BEST BET.

333
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,901
>> THE HOUSE WAS VERY CLOSE

334
00:08:42,901 --> 00:08:45,076

335
00:08:45,076 --> 00:08:46,077
AND WE'RE GONNA CHECK IT OUT

I HAVE TO START STUDYING

ERIC IS GONNA TAKE PART-TIME

345
00:08:56,812 --> 00:08:58,330
CLASSES AT A LOCAL COMMUNITY

346
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,642
COLLEGE, SO HE'LL BE AROUND

347
00:08:59,642 --> 00:09:00,988
TO HELP ME GET READY.

348
00:09:00,988 --> 00:09:04,440
I'M GONNA SIT RIGHT HERE.

349
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,303
>> WANT ME TO ASK YOU

350
00:09:05,303 --> 00:09:06,546
SOME QUESTIONS?

00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,030
WHAT'S TWO PLUS TWO?

352
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:08,996
>> THAT'S NOT GONNA BE

353
00:09:08,996 --> 00:09:12,862
ON A G.E.D.

354
00:09:12,862 --> 00:09:14,692
>> WELL, HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT

355
00:09:14,692 --> 00:09:15,693
SKIPPING YOUR LAST YEAR OF

356
00:09:15,693 --> 00:09:16,452
HIGH SCHOOL?

357
00:09:16,452 --> 00:09:17,418
YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET TO PLAY

358
00:09:17,418 --> 00:09:18,040
SOFTBALL.

359
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,662
>> I COULD.

360
00:09:19,662 --> 00:09:20,387
>> OH, YEAH?

361
00:09:20,387 --> 00:09:21,008
HOW?

362
00:09:21,008 --> 00:09:22,527
>> JUST NOT IN THE SCHOOL.

363
00:09:22,527 --> 00:09:23,563
>> HOW ARE YOU GONNA DO THAT

364
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:25,150
WITH THE BABY?

365
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,600
GO TO PRACTICE EVERY DAY?

366
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,636
YOU STILL GOT TO GO TO PRACTICE.

367
00:09:27,636 --> 00:09:28,568
>> THERE'S NOT PRACTICE.

368
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:29,499
>> JUST 'CAUSE IT'S NOT IN

369
00:09:29,499 --> 00:09:30,466
SCHOOL DON'T MEAN YOU WON'T

370
00:09:30,466 --> 00:09:31,191
HAVE PRACTICE.

371

PLAN IS FOR SCHOOL, COLLEGE,

373
00:09:34,919 --> 00:09:35,713
NOTHING.

>> I KNOW.

BUT A YEAR AND A HALF,

376
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,578
SHE'LL BE ABLE TO, YOU KNOW,

377
00:09:38,578 --> 00:09:40,718
MOVE AROUND MORE, AND SHE WON'T

378
00:09:40,718 --> 00:09:42,409
BE AS, YOU KNOW, HARD TO TAKE

379
00:09:42,409 --> 00:09:44,480
BE AS, YOU KNOW, HARD TO TAKE
CARE OF.

380
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,724
CARE OF.

381
00:09:46,724 --> 00:09:47,863
>> YEAH, BUT I'M GONNA BE DOING

ONLINE CLASSES FOR PROBABLY
THE FIRST TWO SEMESTERS.

THE FIRST TWO SEMESTERS.

385
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:02,671
>> I'M REALLY STARTING TO WORRY

386
00:10:02,671 --> 00:10:03,844
ABOUT BEING ABLE TO FOCUS

387
00:10:03,844 --> 00:10:05,363
ON SCHOOL WHILE I'M TAKING CARE

388
00:10:05,363 --> 00:10:06,571
OF A BABY.

389
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:07,710
AND BECAUSE MY MOM HASN'T GIVEN

390
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,436
THE BEST ADVICE IN THE PAST,

391
00:10:09,436 --> 00:10:10,437
ERIC'S AUNT TAMMY AGREED

392
00:10:10,437 --> 00:10:11,438
TO TALK TO ME.

393
00:10:11,438 --> 00:10:12,439
I MEAN, THERE'S, LIKE, SO MANY

394
00:10:12,439 --> 00:10:14,234
THINGS I PROBABLY NEED,

395
00:10:14,234 --> 00:10:15,718
AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW ABOUT IT.

396
00:10:15,718 --> 00:10:16,719
>> THERE'S A TON OF STUFF

397
00:10:16,719 --> 00:10:17,651
YOU NEED FOR A BABY.

398
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:18,825
>> LIKE WHAT?

00:10:21,551 --> 00:10:22,483
>> LIKE, WHAT ARE THE MAIN

402
00:10:22,483 --> 00:10:23,312
THINGS, THOUGH?

403

00:10:27,281 --> 00:10:28,628
LITTLE NOSE SUCKERS

407
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,801

409
00:10:31,976 --> 00:10:33,943
YOU MAKE IT SOUND SO NASTY.

410
00:10:33,943 --> 00:10:35,704
I'VE JUST BEEN THINKING ABOUT

411
00:10:35,704 --> 00:10:36,705
A LOT OF THINGS.

412
00:10:36,705 --> 00:10:37,671
LIKE, A LOT OF THINGS ARE ON

413
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:38,499
MY MIND RIGHT NOW--

414
00:10:38,499 --> 00:10:40,329
MY MOM AND THEN WHENEVER

415
00:10:40,329 --> 00:10:42,158
ERIC STARTS SCHOOL.

416
00:10:42,158 --> 00:10:43,056
>> THEN YOU'RE GONNA BE

417
00:10:43,056 --> 00:10:43,746
BY YOURSELF.

418
00:10:43,746 --> 00:10:44,851
THAT'S PROBABLY THE MAIN THING,

419
00:10:44,851 --> 00:10:45,506
RIGHT?

420
00:10:45,506 --> 00:10:46,197
>> IT IS.

421
00:10:46,197 --> 00:10:46,956
I'M JUST GONNA BE

422
00:10:46,956 --> 00:10:48,440
A LONELY WOMAN.

423
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,511
A LONELY WOMAN.
>> WELL...

>> WELL...

425
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:54,412
>> I'M HOPING IT WON'T BE

426
00:10:54,412 --> 00:10:55,482
TOO BAD, SINCE THE HOUSE WE

428
00:10:56,794 --> 00:10:58,002
THE EDGE OF ERIC'S GRANDMOTHER'S

429
00:10:58,002 --> 00:10:59,141
PROPERTY.

430
00:10:59,141 --> 00:11:00,073
WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE

431
00:11:00,073 --> 00:11:03,801

00:19:58,507 --> 00:19:59,715
ANYWAY, SO IT'S KIND OF

750
00:19:59,715 --> 00:20:01,752
ANYWAY, SO IT'S KIND OF
UNCOMFORTABLE.

751
00:20:01,752 --> 00:20:06,446
UNCOMFORTABLE.

752
00:20:06,446 --> 00:20:07,309
>> OH!

753
00:20:07,309 --> 00:20:08,068
>> OH, THAT'S--

754
00:20:08,068 --> 00:20:10,070
>> OH, THAT'S--
>> GOD!

755
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:12,383
>> GOD!

756
00:20:12,383 --> 00:20:13,246
>> I WANT HER TO MOVE

757
00:20:13,246 --> 00:20:14,074
SO I CAN FEEL IT.

758
00:20:14,074 --> 00:20:16,939
I HAVEN'T FELT IT YET.

759
00:20:16,939 --> 00:20:17,975
OH!

760
00:20:17,975 --> 00:20:18,631
>> SEE?

761
00:20:18,631 --> 00:20:20,667
>> THAT'S CRAZY.

762
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:22,151
>> HURRY UP, MYRANDA.

763
00:20:22,151 --> 00:20:23,152
YOU GOT A BUNCH OF PRESENTS

764
00:20:23,152 --> 00:20:23,981
TO OPEN.

765
00:20:23,981 --> 00:20:24,671
>> NANNY!

766
00:20:24,671 --> 00:20:25,534
>> I'M GONNA GET TIRED

767
00:20:25,534 --> 00:20:28,054
STANDING UP HERE.

768
00:20:28,054 --> 00:20:29,642
>> OH, MY GOSH.

769
00:20:29,642 --> 00:20:31,747
>> OH, MY GOSH.
HAVE A BABY CAT.

770
00:20:31,747 --> 00:20:33,991
HAVE A BABY CAT.

771
00:20:33,991 --> 00:20:35,475
>> HOW HAVE YOU BEEN FEELING?

772
00:20:35,475 --> 00:20:37,305
YOU HURTING ANY?

773
00:20:37,305 --> 00:20:38,202
>> EVERY NOW AND THEN,

774
00:20:38,202 --> 00:20:39,721
SHE PUSHES DOWN ON ME.

775
00:20:39,721 --> 00:20:40,549
>> SO PRESSURE?

776
00:20:40,549 --> 00:20:41,619
YOU'RE HAVING A LOT OF PRESSURE?

777
00:20:41,619 --> 00:20:43,621
YOU'RE HAVING A LOT OF PRESSURE?
>> MM-HMM.

778
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:47,349
>> MM-HMM.

779
00:20:47,349 --> 00:20:50,249
>> MYRANDA, IT'S NO...

780
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:52,078
UM, SECRET THAT I HAVE

781
00:20:52,078 --> 00:20:53,735
A PROBLEM, AND I HAVE STRUGGLED

782
00:20:53,735 --> 00:20:56,841
MY WHOLE LIFE WITH ALCOHOLISM

783
00:20:56,841 --> 00:20:59,016
AND A DRUG ADDICTION.

784
00:20:59,016 --> 00:21:01,190
BUT I'VE JOINED AN INTENSIVE

785
00:21:01,190 --> 00:21:02,847
OUTPATIENT PROGRAM WHERE I GO

786
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,849
THREE DAYS A WEEK, AND I'LL STAY

787
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:06,886
WITH THAT PROGRAM FOR AS LONG

788
00:21:06,886 --> 00:21:08,059
AS THEY TELL ME I NEED TO STAY

789
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,061
WITH IT, WHICH WILL PROBABLY BE

790
00:21:10,061 --> 00:21:11,718
AT LEAST A YEAR, IF NOT MORE,

791
00:21:11,718 --> 00:21:13,237
SO...

792
00:21:13,237 --> 00:21:14,238
BUT I HAVE A LOT OF ISSUES

793
00:21:14,238 --> 00:21:15,239
AND A LOT OF PROBLEMS THAT

794
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:16,240
I HAVE TO DEAL WITH,

795
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,104
AND I'VE NEVER WANTED TO FACE

796
00:21:18,104 --> 00:21:19,105
THEM OR DEAL WITH THEM,

797
00:21:19,105 --> 00:21:20,693
BUT IT'S TIME THAT I DO.

798
00:21:20,693 --> 00:21:23,212
SO THAT'S WHERE I'M AT.

799
00:21:23,212 --> 00:21:24,524
>> YEAH, THAT'S A MAJOR THING,

800
00:21:24,524 --> 00:21:27,044
SO YOU CAN SPEND AS MUCH TIME

801
00:21:27,044 --> 00:21:28,873
WITH YOUR GRANDBABY AS YOU CAN.

802
00:21:28,873 --> 00:21:30,461
>> YES.

803
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:31,462
>> JUST, HOPEFULLY, YOU DON'T

804
00:21:31,462 --> 00:21:32,498
HAVE, LIKE, ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS

805
00:21:32,498 --> 00:21:34,189
AGAIN, WHERE YOU LEAVE WHILE

806
00:21:34,189 --> 00:21:37,641
YOU'RE TRYING TO WORK ON IT,

807
00:21:37,641 --> 00:21:39,332
LIKE BEFORE.

808
00:21:39,332 --> 00:21:40,299
>> I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

809
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:43,302
THAT...

810
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,442
I AM 100% COMMITTED, SO THAT

811
00:21:45,442 --> 00:21:47,167
I CAN SEE MY GRANDBABY BEING

812
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:49,963
BORN, OKAY?

813
00:21:49,963 --> 00:21:50,964
I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA LET ME IN

814
00:21:50,964 --> 00:21:51,965
THE DELIVERY ROOM WHEN YOU'RE

815
00:21:51,965 --> 00:21:53,242
HAVING THE BABY, RIGHT?

816
00:21:53,242 --> 00:21:54,899
>> I GUESS.

817
00:21:54,899 --> 00:21:56,349
>> ME AND ERIC AND YOU.

818
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:57,868
I THINK THAT'S THE BEST THREE

819
00:21:57,868 --> 00:22:00,284
I THINK THAT'S THE BEST THREE
THAT SHOULD BE IN THERE.

820
00:22:00,284 --> 00:22:02,251
THAT SHOULD BE IN THERE.

821
00:22:02,251 --> 00:22:03,356
>> I APPRECIATE MY MOM'S

822
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:05,047
APOLOGY, BUT SINCE I'VE HEARD IT

823
00:22:05,047 --> 00:22:06,532
ALL BEFORE, I'M NOT SURE

824
00:22:06,532 --> 00:22:07,912
THIS TIME WILL BE DIFFERENT.

825
00:22:07,912 --> 00:22:09,431
>> YOU THINK ERIC'S GONNA HANDLE

826
00:22:09,431 --> 00:22:11,606
THE DELIVERY ROOM OKAY?

827
00:22:11,606 --> 00:22:12,814
>> UH...

828
00:22:12,814 --> 00:22:14,436
[laughter]

829
00:22:14,436 --> 00:22:15,782
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW HE'S GONNA

830
00:22:15,782 --> 00:22:17,059
REACT.

831
00:22:17,059 --> 00:22:18,751
THE DOCTOR SAID, "YOU CAN ONLY

832
00:22:18,751 --> 00:22:20,753
HAVE TWO PEOPLE IN THE LABOR

833
00:22:20,753 --> 00:22:21,374
ROOM."

834
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:22,341
SO I FIGURED YOU AND ERIC

835
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:23,790
COULD BE THE ONES.

836
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:24,964
YOU WANT TO BE IN THE LABOR ROOM

837
00:22:24,964 --> 00:22:25,965
WITH ME?

838
00:22:25,965 --> 00:22:27,449
>> YEAH, I WILL.

839
00:22:27,449 --> 00:22:29,140
SO YOU DECIDED NOT TO HAVE

840
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,970
YOUR MOM IN THERE?

841
00:22:30,970 --> 00:22:32,351
>> YEAH, I HAVEN'T TOLD HER YET,

842
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:33,317
THOUGH.

843
00:22:33,317 --> 00:22:34,145
>> UH-OH.

844
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:35,077
>> WELL, SEE, I FIGURED--

845
00:22:35,077 --> 00:22:37,873
BOYFRIEND AND MY BEST FRIEND.

846
00:22:37,873 --> 00:22:39,427
>> AUNT KRISTIAN.

847
00:22:39,427 --> 00:22:41,463
>> [laughs]

848
00:22:41,463 --> 00:22:42,395
>> SHE'S PROBABLY NOT GONNA

849
00:22:42,395 --> 00:22:43,258
TAKE THAT VERY WELL.

850
00:22:43,258 --> 00:22:45,640
SHE WANTED TO BE IN THERE BAD.

851
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:47,918
>> IT'S NOT HER BABY ANYWAY.

852
00:22:47,918 --> 00:22:49,022
>> HER BABY IS HAVING THE BABY,

853
00:22:49,022 --> 00:22:49,747
THOUGH.

854
00:22:49,747 --> 00:22:50,817
>> YEAH.

855
00:22:50,817 --> 00:22:53,130
BUT SINCE I CAN ONLY HAVE TWO,

856
00:22:53,130 --> 00:22:54,614
SHE'LL JUST HAVE TO GET OVER

857
00:22:54,614 --> 00:22:56,720
SHE'LL JUST HAVE TO GET OVER
THAT.

858
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,308
THAT.

859
00:22:59,308 --> 00:23:00,655
[chime dings]

860
00:23:00,655 --> 00:23:01,966
IT'S GONNA BE HARD TO TELL MY

861
00:23:01,966 --> 00:23:03,451
MOM, BUT I THINK NOT HAVING HER

862
00:23:03,451 --> 00:23:05,729
MOM, BUT I THINK NOT HAVING HER
AT THE HOSPITAL IS WHAT'S BEST.

863
00:23:05,729 --> 00:23:12,805
AT THE HOSPITAL IS WHAT'S BEST.

864
00:23:12,805 --> 00:23:13,806
>> I HAVEN'T DECIDED WHEN

865
00:23:13,806 --> 00:23:15,152
I'M GOING TO TELL MY MOM I DON'T

866
00:23:15,152 --> 00:23:16,774
WANT HER IN THE DELIVERY ROOM,

867
00:23:16,774 --> 00:23:17,948
AND I'M TRYING TO STAY FOCUSED

868
00:23:17,948 --> 00:23:20,433
ON GETTING MY G.E.D., ESPECIALLY

869
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:21,607
NOW THAT MY FRIENDS ARE BACK

870
00:23:21,607 --> 00:23:22,953
IN SCHOOL, AND ERIC IS STARTING

871
00:23:22,953 --> 00:23:25,369
IN SCHOOL, AND ERIC IS STARTING
HIS COMMUNITY COLLEGE CLASSES.

872
00:23:25,369 --> 00:23:27,992
HIS COMMUNITY COLLEGE CLASSES.

873
00:23:27,992 --> 00:23:28,993
>> ARE YOU HAPPY THAT ERIC'S

874
00:23:28,993 --> 00:23:29,994
GOING TO COLLEGE, OR DOES IT--

875
00:23:29,994 --> 00:23:31,202
>> YEAH, I'M REAL HAPPY.

876
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:32,928
I THINK THAT'S A GOOD THING,

877
00:23:32,928 --> 00:23:34,620
'CAUSE HE'S TRYING TO SUPPORT ME

878
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:38,106
AND WHEN SHE COMES AND...

879
00:23:38,106 --> 00:23:39,418
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE HE MAKES A LOT

880
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,798
OF MONEY A MONTH, YOU KNOW?

881
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:41,765
>> YEAH.

882
00:23:41,765 --> 00:23:44,457
>> MAYBE, LIKE, $150 A WEEK.

883
00:23:44,457 --> 00:23:46,355
>> YOU GET LONELY BEING...

884
00:23:46,355 --> 00:23:48,116
>> YEAH, I GET REAL LONELY.

885
00:23:48,116 --> 00:23:49,773
>> DO YOU MISS SCHOOL OR...

886
00:23:49,773 --> 00:23:50,774
>> YEAH, I'M GETTING, LIKE,

887
00:23:50,774 --> 00:23:52,603
REAL TIRED OF NOT BEING ABLE

888
00:23:52,603 --> 00:23:53,880
TO SEE MY FRIENDS.

889
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,882
IF I COULD, I WOULD GO BACK

890
00:23:55,882 --> 00:23:56,814
TO SCHOOL.

891
00:23:56,814 --> 00:23:57,608
I JUST...

892
00:23:57,608 --> 00:23:58,954
LIKE, I'M ALWAYS FEELING SO

893
00:23:58,954 --> 00:24:00,646
SICK AND NAUSEOUS ALL THE TIME.

894
00:24:00,646 --> 00:24:02,475
IF I COULD TAKE ALL OF THIS

895
00:24:02,475 --> 00:24:06,237
BACK, I WOULD.

896
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:07,894
BUT I CAN'T TAKE IT BACK.

897
00:24:07,894 --> 00:24:09,378
MY DUE DATE IS ONLY TWO WEEKS

898
00:24:09,378 --> 00:24:11,001
AWAY, SO I ASKED ERIC'S FAMILY

899
00:24:11,001 --> 00:24:12,174
TO HELP US PUT THE FINISHING

900
00:24:12,174 --> 00:24:14,763
TO HELP US PUT THE FINISHING
TOUCHES ON OUR NEW HOUSE.

901
00:24:14,763 --> 00:24:17,697
TOUCHES ON OUR NEW HOUSE.

902
00:24:17,697 --> 00:24:20,079
TODAY, WE CAN FINALLY MOVE IN,

903
00:24:20,079 --> 00:24:21,080
BUT I'M SO PREGNANT, I CAN'T

904
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,737
REALLY HELP MUCH.

905
00:24:22,737 --> 00:24:23,738
SO I'M GLAD KRISTIAN AND MY

906
00:24:23,738 --> 00:24:24,911
FRIENDS SHOWED UP.

907
00:24:24,911 --> 00:24:26,430
>> ONE MORE TRIP.

908
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:27,914
>> THIS IS NOT FUN AT ALL.

909
00:24:27,914 --> 00:24:28,881
>> CAN Y'ALL, LIKE, GO

910
00:24:28,881 --> 00:24:30,089
A LITTLE FASTER, ESPECIALLY

911
00:24:30,089 --> 00:24:30,883
THIS ONE?

912
00:24:30,883 --> 00:24:32,229
>> OH, I GOT TO GET MY XBOX.

913
00:24:32,229 --> 00:24:33,161
YOU KNOW, THAT'S THE MOST

914
00:24:33,161 --> 00:24:34,058
IMPORTANT THING.

915
00:24:34,058 --> 00:24:36,336
>> THAT STUPID XBOX.

916
00:24:36,336 --> 00:24:37,165
>> I THINK I'LL JUST

917
00:24:37,165 --> 00:24:39,374
PUT IT IN HERE.

918
00:24:39,374 --> 00:24:40,375
[grunts]

919
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:41,859
>> OH, IS THAT YOUR BABY?

920
00:24:41,859 --> 00:24:42,895
>> NO, IT'S JUST EASIER

921
00:24:42,895 --> 00:24:43,896
TO CARRY.

922
00:24:43,896 --> 00:24:45,691
>> DON'T DROP HER.

923
00:24:45,691 --> 00:24:47,002
>> MM-HMM.

924
00:24:47,002 --> 00:24:48,003
[rain pattering]

925
00:24:48,003 --> 00:24:50,661
>> RUN!

926
00:24:50,661 --> 00:24:52,352
>> MY DUE DATE IS NEXT WEEK,

927
00:24:52,352 --> 00:24:53,664
AND I STILL HAVEN'T TOLD MY MOM

928
00:24:53,664 --> 00:24:55,010
ABOUT MY DECISION NOT TO HAVE

929
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:56,702
HER IN THE DELIVERY ROOM.

930
00:24:56,702 --> 00:24:58,186
SO I INVITED HER OVER

931
00:24:58,186 --> 00:24:59,221
'CAUSE I REALLY CAN'T WAIT

932
00:24:59,221 --> 00:25:01,258
'CAUSE I REALLY CAN'T WAIT
