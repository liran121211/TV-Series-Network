00:00:04,405 --> 00:00:06,040
HI, I'M JORDAN.

3
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,375
I'M 17 YEARS OLD

4
00:00:07,375 --> 00:00:08,276
AND FROM LANCASTER,

5
00:00:08,276 --> 00:00:09,310
PENNSYLVANIA.

6
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,411
I LIVE WITH MY MOM,

7
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:12,446
TWO BROTHERS, AND LITTLE SISTER.

8
00:00:12,446 --> 00:00:13,914
[hisses]

9
00:00:13,914 --> 00:00:15,216
AFTER I GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL

10
00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:16,684
NEXT YEAR, I WANT TO GO TO

11
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:18,519
A TRADE SCHOOL AND GET CERTIFIED

12
00:00:18,519 --> 00:00:20,454
AS A DENTAL HYGIENIST.

13
00:00:20,454 --> 00:00:22,056
BUT FOR NOW, I LIKE TO HANG OUT

14
00:00:22,056 --> 00:00:23,291
WITH MY FRIENDS AT THE SKATING

15
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:24,592
RINK OR JUST CHILL AT THE POOL.

16
00:00:24,592 --> 00:00:25,759
HEY, GIRL.

17
00:00:25,759 --> 00:00:26,760
BUT I HAVEN'T SEEN THEM MUCH

18
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:28,229
THIS SUMMER BECAUSE I'VE BEEN

19
00:00:28,229 --> 00:00:29,130
SPENDING SO MUCH TIME

20
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,131
WITH MY BOYFRIEND TYLER.

21
00:00:30,131 --> 00:00:31,065
>> I LOVE YOU.

22
00:00:31,065 --> 00:00:31,765
>> [laughter]

23
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:32,700
TYLER'S KIND OF A LONER,

24
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,135
AND ISN'T VERY POPULAR

25
00:00:34,135 --> 00:00:35,469
WITH THE KIDS AT SCHOOL.

26
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:36,937
BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER TO ME.

27
00:00:36,937 --> 00:00:37,838
HE'S NOT AN ASS.

28
00:00:37,838 --> 00:00:38,606
HE'S NOT A PERSON

29
00:00:38,606 --> 00:00:39,973
TO CHEAT ON YOU.

30
00:00:39,973 --> 00:00:41,175
>> JORDAN LIKES THOSE TYPE

31
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:42,176
OF BOYS SHE SAID.

32
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:42,943
THAT'S HER TYPE.

33
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:44,011
>> MY FRIENDS UNDERSTAND

34
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:45,246
WHY I LIKE TYLER,

35
00:00:45,246 --> 00:00:46,647
BUT MY MOM DOESN'T GET IT.

36
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:47,681
>> I MEAN, I KNOW YOU LIKE HIM

37
00:00:47,681 --> 00:00:48,382
OR WHATEVER,

38
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,483
BUT HE'S NOBODY THAT I WOULD

39
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:50,684
WANT TO HAVE AROUND ME.

40
00:00:50,684 --> 00:00:51,752
>> SHE DOESN'T LIKE THAT

41
00:00:51,752 --> 00:00:53,053
I'M DATING A WHITE GUY, AND SHE

42
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:54,522
WON'T EVEN LET HIM IN OUR HOUSE.

43
00:00:54,522 --> 00:00:56,090
BUT I REALLY LOVE TYLER.

44
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:57,558
AND HE'S HERE TO STAY...

45
00:00:57,558 --> 00:01:00,027
BECAUSE I'M PREGNANT.

46
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:12,906
I'VE BEEN SLEEPING OVER

47
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:13,741
AT TYLER'S HOUSE

48
00:01:13,741 --> 00:01:15,143
FOR THE PAST FEW WEEKS.

49
00:01:15,143 --> 00:01:16,043
>> [blows raspberry]

50
00:01:16,043 --> 00:01:17,145
>> [chuckles]

51
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:18,078
MY MOM DOESN'T LIKE IT

52
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,647
AND STILL FORBIDS TYLER

53
00:01:19,647 --> 00:01:20,814
TO COME TO OUR HOUSE.

54
00:01:20,814 --> 00:01:22,250
BUT SHE WORKS A GRAVEYARD SHIFT,

55
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:23,751
SO SHE'S LETTING ME STAY HERE

56
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:24,818
IN CASE I NEED TO GET TO

57
00:01:24,818 --> 00:01:26,487
THE HOSPITAL AT NIGHT.

58
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:28,189
TYLER IS ALREADY OUT OF SCHOOL

59
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:28,989
FOR THE SUMMER.

60
00:01:28,989 --> 00:01:30,191
AND I'M FINISHING MY LAST FEW

61
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:31,792
WEEKS OF JUNIOR YEAR FROM HOME.

62
00:01:31,792 --> 00:01:32,893
SO WE'VE BEEN SPENDING

63
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:34,295
A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER.

64
00:01:34,295 --> 00:01:35,529
REMEMBER SCIENCE CLASS

65
00:01:35,529 --> 00:01:36,997
WHEN EVERYBODY WAS LIKE, "ARE

66
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:38,532
YOU GUYS DATING EACH OTHER?"

67
00:01:38,532 --> 00:01:40,534
AND I WAS LIKE, "NO.

68
00:01:40,534 --> 00:01:41,702
WHY WOULD I DATE TYLER?"

69
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:42,703
>> I WOULD, LIKE, TELL PEOPLE,

70
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:43,571
"YEAH, WE'RE DATING,"

71
00:01:43,571 --> 00:01:44,372
'CAUSE I THOUGHT IF

72
00:01:44,372 --> 00:01:46,540
I GOT EVERYONE THINKING WE WERE,

73
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,177
THEN YOU WOULD GO WITH IT.

74
00:01:49,177 --> 00:01:49,943
>> [laughs]

75
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:50,878
NO.

76
00:01:50,878 --> 00:01:51,712
>> LIKE, JUST THE WAY

77
00:01:51,712 --> 00:01:52,713
YOU WOULD TALK TO ME, THE WAY

78
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:54,315
YOU WOULD BE AROUND ME, TO ME,

79
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:55,883
IT SEEMED LIKE YOU LIKED ME

80
00:01:55,883 --> 00:01:57,985
BUT YOU WOULDN'T TELL ME.

81
00:01:57,985 --> 00:01:59,187
LIKE, MOST PEOPLE JUST KIND OF

82
00:01:59,187 --> 00:02:00,188
TALK TO ME A COUPLE TIMES

83
00:02:00,188 --> 00:02:02,690
AND IT'S LIKE, WHATEVER.

84
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:03,691
'CAUSE I HONESTLY JUST DIDN'T

85
00:02:03,691 --> 00:02:05,693
THINK GIRLS--OTHER GIRLS WOULD

86
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:07,461
REALLY THINK ABOUT ME LIKE THAT.

87
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:09,230
>> BUT YOU JUST WAS THE

88
00:02:09,230 --> 00:02:12,200
BOYFRIEND I WOULD DREAM OF.

89
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,401
YOU JUST CATERED TO ME,

90
00:02:13,401 --> 00:02:16,069
AND I DIDN'T HAVE TO ASK.

91
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:18,406
OR ANY TIME I CALLED YOU,

92
00:02:18,406 --> 00:02:20,007
YOU PICKED UP YOUR PHONE.

93
00:02:20,007 --> 00:02:21,175
>> BUT THEN, LIKE, THE MORE

94
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:25,346
AND MORE I WOULD BE WITH YOU,

95
00:02:25,346 --> 00:02:28,048
MY HEART WAS SLOWLY

96
00:02:28,048 --> 00:02:30,050
GOING TO YOU.

97
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:31,752
>> DID YOU EVER THINK ANYTHING

98
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,954
ABOUT ME BEING BLACK?

99
00:02:33,954 --> 00:02:35,088
HIT YOU AT ALL?

100
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:37,591
>> TO ME, YOU'RE JUST

101
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:40,261
A CUTE GIRL AT SCHOOL

102
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:41,895
THAT WOULD ALWAYS GET--

103
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,163
LIKE, TALK TO ME.

104
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:44,465
>> DID IT BUG YOU AT ALL THAT

105
00:02:44,465 --> 00:02:45,733
YOU COULDN'T COME TO MY HOUSE

106
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:49,002
BEFORE AND EVEN NOW?

107
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:50,003
YOU'RE, LIKE, THE FATHER

108
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:51,038
OF MY CHILD AND YOU STILL

109
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:52,139
CAN'T COME TO MY HOUSE.

110
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:55,676
>> IT DOES BUG ME.

111
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:57,211
>> I REALLY WANT ME AND TYLER TO

112
00:02:57,211 --> 00:02:58,812
RAISE THIS BABY TOGETHER, BUT

113
00:02:58,812 --> 00:03:00,814
MY MOM DOESN'T SEE IT THAT WAY.

114
00:03:06,454 --> 00:03:08,556
>> SO WHAT ALL DO WE NEED?

115
00:03:08,556 --> 00:03:10,791
ANY BABY STUFF SPECIFICALLY?

116
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:11,459
>> NO, WELL,

117
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:13,093
WE HAVE A PACK 'N PLAY.

118
00:03:13,093 --> 00:03:14,228
SO WE HAVE ALL THE CLOTHES

119
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:15,629
AND STUFF.

120
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:16,864
>> SO YOU KNOW ONCE YOU HAVE HIM

121
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:18,732
THAT'S IT.

122
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:20,301
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE COMING HOME.

123
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:21,669
I ALLOWED YOU THERE FOR SAFETY

124
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:23,504
REASONS SO THEY CAN GET YOU TO

125
00:03:23,504 --> 00:03:26,774
THE HOSPITAL, BUT YOUSE ARE

126
00:03:26,774 --> 00:03:28,476
COMING HOME, NO IF ANDS OR BUTS.

127
00:03:28,476 --> 00:03:29,577
SO MAKE IT CLEAR WITH THEM

128
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:30,978
SO THEY'RE NOT SHOCKED.

129
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:32,246
>> WELL, HOW IS TY

130
00:03:32,246 --> 00:03:33,314
GONNA SEE HIS BABY?

131
00:03:33,314 --> 00:03:34,415
>> I DON'T REALLY SEE HIM

132
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:35,883
AS BEING A BIG PARTICIPATOR,

133
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:36,617
TO BE HONEST.

134
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:37,618
I REALLY DON'T WANT HIM HERE.

135
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:38,986
>> WHY NOT?

136
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:40,153
>> WELL, FOR STARTERS, HE'S

137
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:41,622
DIRTY, HE'S DIRTY-LOOKING, HE'S

138
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:43,724
DISRESPECTFUL, I DON'T LIKE HIM.

139
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:44,492
>> SO WHAT ABOUT

140
00:03:44,492 --> 00:03:45,326
DURING THE NIGHT?

141
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:46,494
SO IT'S JUST ALL THIS

142
00:03:46,494 --> 00:03:47,661
AND NOT TYLER?

143
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:49,196
TYLER CAN'T HELP IN,

144
00:03:49,196 --> 00:03:50,063
PITCH IN OR ANYTHING?

145
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,899
IT JUST HAS TO BE UP TO US?

146
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:52,533
>> WHAT?

147
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:53,701
YOU WANT HIM TO COME HERE

148
00:03:53,701 --> 00:03:54,368
AT NIGHT?

149
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:55,569
OH, HELL, NO.

150
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:57,538
YOU KNOW THAT'D NEVER, EVER--

151
00:03:57,538 --> 00:03:58,372
YOU KNOW SHACKING UP

152
00:03:58,372 --> 00:03:59,340
DON'T HAPPEN HERE.

153
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:01,041
AND I TOLD YOU BEFORE, WHEN YOU

154
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:02,710
HAVE THAT BABY, YOUR VISITS

155
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:04,345
AND STAYING OVER THERE BEFORE

156
00:04:04,345 --> 00:04:06,480
YOU GIVE BIRTH IS GONNA STOP

157
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,681
IMMEDIATELY.

158
00:04:07,681 --> 00:04:08,382
AS SOON AS WE

159
00:04:08,382 --> 00:04:10,351
GET IN THE HOSPITAL.

160
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:11,619
YOU REMEMBER TYLER'S FACE THAT

161
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:12,720
DAY WHEN YOU TOLD ME OUTSIDE

162
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,388
ABOUT YOU--WHEN YOU GUYS

163
00:04:14,388 --> 00:04:15,623
TOLD ME YOU WERE PREGNANT?

164
00:04:15,623 --> 00:04:16,590
>> DID YOU KNOW THAT WE WERE

165
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,325
GONNA TELL YOU?

166
00:04:17,325 --> 00:04:18,326
>> I KNEW WHERE YOU WERE GOING

167
00:04:18,326 --> 00:04:19,259
WITH IT, BECAUSE I STARTED

168
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:20,994
NOTICING THE BIGGER BRA SIZE

169
00:04:20,994 --> 00:04:23,331
OR THE BOOB SIZE CHANGE,

170
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:24,298
YOUR SLEEPING CHANGE,

171
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:25,399
YOUR EATING CHANGE,

172
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:27,200
I NOTICED,

173
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,202
BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO NOTICE.

174
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:31,705
I KIND OF DIDN'T THINK YOU WOULD

175
00:04:31,705 --> 00:04:33,707
GO THAT ROUTE WITH HIM.

176
00:04:33,707 --> 00:04:35,108
SO I THINK IT WAS MY

177
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,310
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROBABLY

178
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,078
COME TO YOU TO GET YOU

179
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:40,748
ON A TYPE OF BIRTH CONTROL.

180
00:04:40,748 --> 00:04:42,916
BUT ONCE YOU--I SEEN HIM,

181
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:44,785
I DEFINITELY DIDN'T THINK YOU

182
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,253
WOULD BE INTIMATE WITH HIM.

183
00:04:46,253 --> 00:04:47,621
BUT YOU KNOW, I TOLD YOU

184
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,089
YOU HAD AN OPTION AT THE TIME,

185
00:04:49,089 --> 00:04:50,123
AND THEN YOU SAID YOU DIDN'T

186
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,291
WANT TO GET RID OF IT.

187
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:52,159
>> NOT THAT I'M AGAINST

188
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,061
ABORTIONS, UM...

189
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:55,162
>> BUT THAT'S YOUR PREROGATIVE.

190
00:04:55,162 --> 00:04:55,896
>> YEAH, YEAH.

191
00:04:55,896 --> 00:04:56,997
THAT'S JUST WHAT I JUST--I JUST

192
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:58,399
PERSONALLY COULDN'T DO IT.

193
00:04:58,399 --> 00:04:59,633
beep!

194
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:00,801
>> WHO'S IT FROM?

195
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:01,469
>> TY.

196
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:03,070
HE SAYS THAT HE'S HERE.

197
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:03,837
>> JUST MAKE SURE

198
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,839
HE STAYS OUT THERE.

199
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,412
>> THERE'S NO WAY THIS IS

200
00:05:11,412 --> 00:05:13,080
GONNA WORK IF TYLER ISN'T EVEN

201
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,247
ALLOWED IN MY HOUSE.

202
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,082
HEY, TY.

203
00:05:15,082 --> 00:05:17,451
>> HEY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

204
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:18,586
>> WE RECENTLY FOUND OUT

205
00:05:18,586 --> 00:05:19,453
WE'RE HAVING A BOY,

206
00:05:19,453 --> 00:05:20,954
AND WE'RE NAMING HIM CHASE.

207
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:22,322
TYLER SAYS HE'S READY

208
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,924
TO BE A FATHER, BUT IF I LIVE

209
00:05:23,924 --> 00:05:25,058
AT MY MOM'S HOUSE,

210
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,360
THAT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY.

211
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,362
LUCKILY, TYLER'S PARENTS HAVE

212
00:05:28,362 --> 00:05:29,830
BEEN MORE SUPPORTIVE.

213
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,731
>> HEY, HOW'S IT GOING?

214
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:31,432
>> WHAT'S UP?

215
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:32,265
HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

216
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,434
>> TALK TO HER.

217
00:05:33,434 --> 00:05:35,102
>> TALK TO HER.

218
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:35,936
>> SO WHAT'S UP?

219
00:05:35,936 --> 00:05:36,770
>> NEVER AGAIN.

220
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:38,606
I HATE GOING OVER THERE.

221
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:39,940
THERE'S ALWAYS SOME DRAMA.

222
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,809
>> WHAT HAPPENED?

223
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:42,943
>> MY MOM.

224
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:43,677
[both laugh]

225
00:05:43,677 --> 00:05:44,678
>> YOUR MOM HAPPENED.

226
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,313
>> YOUR MOM HAPPENS, YEAH.

227
00:05:46,313 --> 00:05:47,581
>> WELL, YOU KNOW HOW EVERY TIME

228
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:49,349
I GO HOME, MOM'S ALWAYS LIKE,

229
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:51,151
"TY WON'T GET TO SEE THE BABY."

230
00:05:51,151 --> 00:05:52,953
BECAUSE SHE HAS A PROBLEM

231
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:54,688
WITH TYLER, AND IT'S JUST

232
00:05:54,688 --> 00:05:56,490
A HUGE CONFLICT.

233
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:57,658
>> WELL, WHAT ARE YOUR PLANS?

234
00:05:57,658 --> 00:05:58,826
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

235
00:05:58,826 --> 00:06:00,494
>> I WANT TO STAY HERE; NOT GO

236
00:06:00,494 --> 00:06:01,829
OVER THERE, 'CAUSE IF I GO OVER

237
00:06:01,829 --> 00:06:03,931
THERE, SHE'S GONNA BE LIKE,

238
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:05,633
"ME, ME, ME, ME, ME.

239
00:06:05,633 --> 00:06:06,867
MY, MY, MY, MY, MY.

240
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,402
MY WAY, NOT YOUR WAY."

241
00:06:08,402 --> 00:06:09,803
>> [grumbles]

242
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:11,505
SHE JUST SEEMS LIKE THE KIND OF

243
00:06:11,505 --> 00:06:12,606
PERSON WHO'S JUST GONNA TRY AND

244
00:06:12,606 --> 00:06:13,674
TELL YOU HOW IT IS.

245
00:06:13,674 --> 00:06:15,208
AND GONNA TRY AND CONTROL

246
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,844
HOW OUR SON IS RAISED.

247
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:17,611
SO--

248
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:18,612
>> WELL, YOU KNOW,

249
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:19,813
WE NEED YOU TO BE SURE OF

250
00:06:19,813 --> 00:06:21,815
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO.

251
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:22,516
>> YEAH.

252
00:06:22,516 --> 00:06:23,383
>> BUT YOU ALREADY KNOW

253
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:24,117
WHAT YOU WANT.

254
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:25,486
>> I DEFINITELY WANT TO

255
00:06:25,486 --> 00:06:26,153
STAY HERE.

256
00:06:26,153 --> 00:06:27,354
>> AND YOU KNOW YOU HAVE

257
00:06:27,354 --> 00:06:28,355
THAT OPTION, RIGHT?

258
00:06:28,355 --> 00:06:29,022
>> YEAH.

259
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:30,023
I JUST DON'T HAVE, LIKE,

260
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:33,193
THE BALLS TO TELL MY MOM.

261
00:06:33,193 --> 00:06:34,695
>> DON'T WORRY ABOUT THAT.

262
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:37,364
AND WE'LL FIGURE IT ALL OUT.

263
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:38,131
YOU JUST HAVE TO

264
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:38,932
BE PREPARED THOUGH,

265
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:43,370
'CAUSE SHE IS GONNA BE MAD.

266
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:44,738
>> WELL, THANK YOUSE.

267
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:45,539
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

268
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:46,306
>> DON'T FORGET,

269
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:47,174
YOU'RE ALWAYS WELCOME.

270
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:48,041
>> ALWAYS WELCOME HERE.

271
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,176
YOU NEVER HAVE TO WORRY.

272
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:51,579
>> THANK YOU GUYS.

273
00:06:51,579 --> 00:06:52,513
MY FEET HURT.

274
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:55,248
TYLER.

275
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:56,584
>> THE WAY I SEE IT,

276
00:06:56,584 --> 00:06:58,318
YOUR MOM HAS A CHOICE HERE.

277
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:01,054
LIKE, SHE CAN BE ACCEPTING OF

278
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:03,457
YOUR DECISION TO BE HERE AND

279
00:07:03,457 --> 00:07:05,358
JUST TRY TO BE THE GRANDMOTHER--

280
00:07:05,358 --> 00:07:06,426
>> WHAT IF SHE GETS THE COPS

281
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,895
INVOLVED WHEN WE TELL HER THAT

282
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:11,364
WE'RE TAKING THE BABY HERE?

283
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:12,866
>> I'LL FIGHT HER TO THE DEATH.

284
00:07:12,866 --> 00:07:14,935
LIKE, SHE IS NOT GONNA

285
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,404
KEEP MY SON AWAY FROM ME.

286
00:07:17,404 --> 00:07:20,741
>> ARE YOU SCARED?

287
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:22,075
>> I'M NERVOUS, BUT I MEAN,

288
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:24,144
I'M NOT BACKING DOWN.

289
00:07:41,895 --> 00:07:43,430
>> OUR BABY'S DUE IN LESS THAN

290
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:44,431
A MONTH, AND I'M A LITTLE

291
00:07:44,431 --> 00:07:45,633
FREAKED OUT BY MY DECISION

292
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:47,300
TO LIVE AT TYLER'S HOUSE.

293
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,969
NOT ONLY AM I SCARED

294
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:49,737
TO TELL MY MOM...

295
00:07:49,737 --> 00:07:50,437
>> TY.

296
00:07:50,437 --> 00:07:51,271
>> BUT WE DON'T HAVE

297
00:07:51,271 --> 00:07:52,305
ANY OF THE STUFF WE NEED

298
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:53,907
FOR WHEN THE BABY COMES HOME.

299
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:55,008
>> WHERE ARE WE GOING?

300
00:07:55,008 --> 00:07:56,109
>> WE'RE GOING TO GET CLOTHES.

301
00:07:56,109 --> 00:07:56,744
>> LIKE--

302
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:57,511
>> BABY CLOTHES.

303
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:59,446
>> ONESIES, BIBS.

304
00:07:59,446 --> 00:08:00,948
>> ALL THAT GOOD STUFF.

305
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:01,649
>> LET'S GO.

306
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:02,482
>> TYLER, DO YOU HAVE

307
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,150
YOUR WALLET?

308
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,451
>> YEP.

309
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:06,053
>> TYLER ALREADY SPENT A LOT OF

310
00:08:06,053 --> 00:08:07,788
HIS SAVINGS ON BABY SUPPLIES.

311
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:09,289
HE EVEN PAID $300

312
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,457
FOR THE CRIB I WANTED.

313
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:11,458
BUT ALL THAT STUFF

314
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,960
IS OVER AT MY MOM'S HOUSE.

315
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,961
AND SHE'LL NEVER

316
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:15,629
LET US TAKE IT TO TYLER'S.

317
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,397
SO I'M MEETING MY FRIEND EMILY

318
00:08:17,397 --> 00:08:18,431
TO SHOP FOR SOME CLOTHES

319
00:08:18,431 --> 00:08:20,067
AND MAYBE A BASSINET

320
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,835
FOR THE BABY TO SLEEP IN.

321
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,171
>> HEY, GIRL.

322
00:08:24,171 --> 00:08:25,706
>> WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

323
00:08:25,706 --> 00:08:26,640
>> LIKE, CLOTHES.

324
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,708
I WANT NEWBORN STUFF.

325
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:28,842
I HAVE ALL THIS OTHER STUFF

326
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,878
FOR LATER ON, BUT--

327
00:08:30,878 --> 00:08:32,012
>> JORDAN.

328
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:32,913
>> TYLER.

329
00:08:32,913 --> 00:08:33,847
>> COME HERE.

330
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,816
>> BABE, WILL YOU LOOK AT THIS?

331
00:08:35,816 --> 00:08:36,817
>> WHAT'S THIS?

332
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:37,851
>> THIS IS LIKE A BASSINET,

333
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:38,652
RIGHT?

334
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:39,319
>> I GUESS.

335
00:08:39,319 --> 00:08:40,320
>> I THINK THERE'S A BASSINET

336
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,421
OVER HERE TOO.

337
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:43,657
>> YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THIS.

338
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:45,693
>> HOW MUCH IS IT?

339
00:08:45,693 --> 00:08:46,359
>> DUCKIES.

340
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,828
>> THIS IS, LIKE, 55 BUCKS.

341
00:08:47,828 --> 00:08:48,996
I MEAN, SERIOUSLY?

342
00:08:48,996 --> 00:08:51,665
LIKE, ISN'T THAT A BIT PRICEY?

343
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:52,700
>> WE'LL SEE.

344
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,634
>> IS THE BABY GONNA STAY

345
00:08:53,634 --> 00:08:54,501
AT YOUR HOUSE, TYLER,

346
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:55,235
OR AT JORDAN'S?

347
00:08:55,235 --> 00:08:55,869
>> YEAH.

348
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:56,704
HE'S STAYING WITH US.

349
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:58,038
>> MY MOM WANTS IT AT HER HOUSE.

350
00:08:58,038 --> 00:08:59,139
>> IS YOUR MOM GONNA BE MAD

351
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,307
THAT, LIKE, HE'S GONNA STAY

352
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:01,341
WITH TYLER AND YOU GUYS?

353
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:02,342
>> YEAH.

354
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:04,011
SHE DOESN'T LIKE TYLER.

355
00:09:04,011 --> 00:09:05,512
>> WHY DOESN'T SHE LIKE TYLER?

356
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:07,047
>> WHY DO YOU THINK?

357
00:09:07,047 --> 00:09:08,515
>> YOU'RE WHITE.

358
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:09,717
>> OH.

359
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:10,550
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

360
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,985
>> LIKE, WHEN I FIRST MET HER,

361
00:09:11,985 --> 00:09:13,186
SHE KIND OF LOOKED AT ME LIKE,

362
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:14,387
"OH, YOU'RE WHITE?"

363
00:09:14,387 --> 00:09:15,388
>> "HOW IS HE GONNA

364
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,057
RAISE A BLACK BABY?

365
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,792
I MEAN, LIKE, SOME KID'S GONNA

366
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:19,760
BE LIKE, 'YEAH, WHAT'S UP?'

367
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,661
AND HE'S GONNA BE LIKE,

368
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:22,062
'WHAT'S UP?'"

369
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:22,730
YOU KNOW?

370
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,397
[both laugh]

371
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:28,602
>> OH, MY GOODNESS.

372
00:09:28,602 --> 00:09:30,337
>> THE TRUTH IS, MY MOM

373
00:09:30,337 --> 00:09:31,404
WASN'T THE ONLY ONE SURPRISED

374
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,106
WHEN WE GOT TOGETHER.

375
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,341
MY FRIENDS DIDN'T EXPECT IT

376
00:09:34,341 --> 00:09:35,776
EITHER.

377
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:39,279
>> OKAY, NO OFFENSE, BUT...

378
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,781
[laughter]

379
00:09:40,781 --> 00:09:41,915
I BET HER MOM--I WAS LIKE, "OH,

380
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,450
MY GOSH, WHAT DID YOUR MOM SAY?"

381
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,251
>> "I CAN'T BELIEVE

382
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:44,985
YOU DID THIS.

383
00:09:44,985 --> 00:09:46,219
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU DID THIS

384
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:48,288
WITH TYLER."

385
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:50,257
LIKE, EVERYBODY SAYS, "TYLER.

386
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,625
OH, MY GOSH, HIM?"

387
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:52,492
>> WATCH HIM TURN OUT

388
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:53,493
AS THE BEST DAD.

389
00:09:53,493 --> 00:09:54,494
>> YEAH, I THINK HE WILL BE.

390
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:55,462
BUT MY MOM THINKS THAT

391
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:56,697
AS SOON AS I HAVE THE BABY,

392
00:09:56,697 --> 00:09:58,966
WE'RE GONNA GO TO HER HOUSE.

393
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:01,268
IT'S A SMALL HOUSE--

394
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:02,135
>> IS SHE GONNA LET TY

395
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:03,003
SLEEP OVER AND STUFF?

396
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:03,603
>> NO.

397
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,137
NO.

398
00:10:04,137 --> 00:10:05,072
NO, TY ISN'T EVEN ALLOWED

399
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:05,806
INTO THE HOUSE.

400
00:10:05,806 --> 00:10:08,541
BUT WHEN I AM IN THE HOSPITAL,

401
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,743
I'M GONNA TELL HER

402
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:11,578
THAT I'M STAYING WITH TYLER.

403
00:10:11,578 --> 00:10:12,479
>> DON'T YOU THINK--

404
00:10:12,479 --> 00:10:14,848
YOU KNOW, IN THE DELIVERY ROOM,

405
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:16,016
THAT'S KIND OF LIKE--

406
00:10:16,016 --> 00:10:17,017
>> THAT'S, LIKE, LAST MINUTE.

407
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:17,751
>> LAST MINUTE.

408
00:10:17,751 --> 00:10:18,551
>> THAT'S PERFECT.

409
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:19,419
>> THAT'S NOT PERFECT.

410
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:20,153
THAT'S THE WAY

411
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:20,954
TO START ARGUMENTS.

412
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:21,755
>> DON'T YOU THINK

413
00:10:21,755 --> 00:10:22,690
SHE'S GONNA BE REALLY MAD?

414
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:23,423
>> REALLY MAD.

415
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:24,257
>> BUT THEN I COULD

416
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:25,558
KICK HER OUT OF THE ROOM.

417
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:26,593
>> DO YOU WANT ALL THAT CONFLICT

418
00:10:26,593 --> 00:10:27,560
IN THE BABY ROOM THOUGH?

419
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,261
>> EXACTLY.

420
00:10:28,261 --> 00:10:28,996
>> NO, NO.

421
00:10:28,996 --> 00:10:30,363
YOU SHOULD JUST TELL HER NOW.

422
00:10:30,363 --> 00:10:31,564
YOUR MOM WILL SEE IT BETTER

423
00:10:31,564 --> 00:10:32,599
IF IT'S IN YOUR POINT OF VIEW

424
00:10:32,599 --> 00:10:33,500
AND YOU TELL HER, LIKE,

425
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,802
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT IT.

426
00:10:34,802 --> 00:10:35,803
>> SHE DON'T CARE.

427
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:36,670
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW?

428
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,337
>> EXACTLY.

429
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:38,505
>> SHE TOLD ME...

430
00:10:38,505 --> 00:10:42,009
SHE DIDN'T CARE.

431
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:43,110
I GUESS YOU HAVE GOOD POINTS

432
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,845
THOUGH.

433
00:10:44,845 --> 00:10:45,779
>> LIKE, I UNDERSTAND

434
00:10:45,779 --> 00:10:48,015
YOU'RE SCARED, BUT...

435
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:49,016
EITHER WAY, YOU'RE GONNA

436
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:50,884
HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT.

437
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:58,025
>> I KNOW TELLING MY MOM

438
00:10:58,025 --> 00:10:58,926
ABOUT OUR PLANS

439
00:10:58,926 --> 00:11:00,593
IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

440
00:11:00,593 --> 00:11:01,729
BUT I'M JUST TOO SCARED

441
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:04,064
OF HOW SHE'LL REACT.

442
00:11:04,064 --> 00:11:05,265
>> SURPRISE!

443
00:11:05,265 --> 00:11:06,399
>> OH, MY GOD.

444
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,436
WE WERE JUST LOOKING AT THIS.

445
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:10,237
>> WERE YOU?

446
00:11:10,237 --> 00:11:10,938
>> YEAH.

447
00:11:10,938 --> 00:11:12,572
OH, LOOK, IT HAS WHEELS, BABE.

448
00:11:12,572 --> 00:11:13,673
>> DID YOU GUYS GET ANY CLOTHES

449
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:14,374
OR ANYTHING?

450
00:11:14,374 --> 00:11:16,176
>> YEAH, WE BOUGHT A JACKET

451
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,077
'CAUSE WE'RE GONNA HAVE

452
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:18,812
THE JACKET THAT'S LIKE,

453
00:11:18,812 --> 00:11:20,080
HIS SIZE RIGHT NOW.

454
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,048
>> DO YOU WANT TO TAKE YOUR

455
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:23,450
BASSINET IN AND SET IT UP?

456
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:24,484
>> I'M GLAD TYLER'S PARENTS

457
00:11:24,484 --> 00:11:25,753
ARE WILLING TO SUPPORT US

458
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:26,619
WHILE WE LIVE HERE.

459
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,055
BUT I'M STARTING TO WORRY

460
00:11:28,055 --> 00:11:29,056
ABOUT RAISING THIS BABY

461
00:11:29,056 --> 00:11:31,191
WITHOUT ANY HELP FROM MY MOM.

462
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:37,664
MY MOM CALLED AND SAID SHE

463
00:11:37,664 --> 00:11:39,432
NEEDED TO SEE ME TODAY.

464
00:11:39,432 --> 00:11:40,267
I DON'T WANT TO GO,

465
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:41,434
BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS DRAMA

466
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:42,402
WHEN I'M OVER THERE,

467
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:44,071
BUT SHE SAID IT WAS IMPORTANT.

468
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:45,105
>> DO YOU KNOW

469
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:46,606
WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

470
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:47,941
>> NO.

471
00:11:47,941 --> 00:11:48,909
>> YOU'RE JUST GOING OVER

472
00:11:48,909 --> 00:11:49,777
TO HANG OUT?

473
00:11:49,777 --> 00:11:50,778
>> YEAH.

474
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:51,779
>> CAN I COME IN

475
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:52,980
AND HANG OUT A LITTLE BIT?

476
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:54,114
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?

477
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:55,315
NO.

478
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:56,483
THAT'S LIKE ASKING ME,

479
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:57,384
DO I WANT TO GO SKYDIVING

480
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:58,485
WITH YOU RIGHT NOW?

481
00:11:58,485 --> 00:11:59,486
>> WELL, DO YOU THINK MAYBE

482
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:00,353
IF YOU TALK WITH YOUR MOM

483
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:01,121
THAT SHE WOULD--

484
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:02,589
>> NOPE.

485
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:04,424
>> THAT'S JUST SO JUST--

486
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:05,258
[sighs]

487
00:12:05,258 --> 00:12:06,126
>> DOES THAT BUG YOU?

488
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:07,194
>> YEAH, IT DOES.

489
00:12:07,194 --> 00:12:11,631
LIKE, YOU'RE HAVING MY KID.

490
00:12:11,631 --> 00:12:12,966
I JUST HATE THIS.

491
00:12:12,966 --> 00:12:14,835
I MEAN--

492
00:12:21,674 --> 00:12:22,976
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

493
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:24,845
>> BYE.

494
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,149
>> all: SURPRISE!

495
00:12:29,149 --> 00:12:30,818
>> DANG!

496
00:12:30,818 --> 00:12:32,619
THIS IS PACKED!

497
00:12:32,619 --> 00:12:33,520
[laughter]

498
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,621
OH, THIS IS SO NICE.

499
00:12:34,621 --> 00:12:36,123
THANKS, MOM...

500
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:37,124
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

501
00:12:37,124 --> 00:12:38,792
>> SO MUCH.

502
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:40,794
DON'T FALL OVER.

503
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:41,795
[indistinct speech]

504
00:12:41,795 --> 00:12:43,063
HEY.

505
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:44,464
WHAT'S THIS BEHIND YOU?

506
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:45,365
>> IT'S A SET UP.

507
00:12:45,365 --> 00:12:46,066
>> PRESENTS.

508
00:12:46,066 --> 00:12:47,567
>> WHAT KATHY SET UP.

509
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:48,701
>> "IT'S SO NICE TO SHARE IN

510
00:12:48,701 --> 00:12:49,803
THIS HAPPY TIME WITH YOU.

511
00:12:49,803 --> 00:12:51,304
BEST WISHES TO BABY AND YOU."

512
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:52,339
OH, DANG.

513
00:12:52,339 --> 00:12:53,673
SHE GOT ME THE SET?

514
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:55,575
OH, THAT'S A BIG BAG.

515
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:57,344
OH, YEAH?

516
00:12:57,344 --> 00:12:59,346
>> SMELLING GOOD.

517
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:00,180
>> OH.

518
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:02,182
YES, I NEED THESE.

519
00:13:02,182 --> 00:13:04,517
CAN NEVER GET TOO MANY DIAPERS.

520
00:13:04,517 --> 00:13:07,454
OH, THAT IS SO CUTE.

521
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:09,256
LOOK AT THIS.

522
00:13:09,256 --> 00:13:10,523
THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.

523
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,359
THANK YOU ALL FOR COMING.

524
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:13,526
>> SO WHEN YOU DUE?

525
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:14,527
>> MAY 29.

526
00:13:14,527 --> 00:13:17,564
IT'S, LIKE, IN TWO WEEKS EXACT.

527
00:13:17,564 --> 00:13:18,498
>> YOU'LL BE SITTING THERE

528
00:13:18,498 --> 00:13:19,232
PUSHING A LOT.

529
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:19,867
PUSHING.

530
00:13:19,867 --> 00:13:21,601
[all laugh]

531
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:22,502
>> I'M DEFINITELY GETTING

532
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:23,470
AN EPIDURAL.

533
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,605
>> AND TYLER, LIKE, I JUST THINK

534
00:13:25,605 --> 00:13:28,275
YOU'LL BE WITH SOMEBODY CUTE.

535
00:13:28,275 --> 00:13:30,243
[laughter]

536
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:31,945
CUTER, YOU KNOW.

537
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:33,580
>> I WAS LIKE, "THAT'S--

538
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,514
THAT'S HER BOYFRIEND?"

539
00:13:34,514 --> 00:13:35,883
[laughter]

540
00:13:35,883 --> 00:13:37,017
I MEAN, I MEAN, LIKE,

541
00:13:37,017 --> 00:13:38,818
I SAY, OPPOSITES--YOU KNOW,

542
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:39,719
YOU GUYS ARE OPPOSITES,

543
00:13:39,719 --> 00:13:40,720
BUT I GUESS OPPOSITES ATTRACT

544
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:41,855
IN THIS CASE.

545
00:13:41,855 --> 00:13:43,223
[laughter]

546
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:44,224
>> I CAME OVER HERE TO TALK.

547
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:46,059
I'M GONNA GO GET MY GRUB ON.

548
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,127
I'M TIRED OF ALWAYS HAVING

549
00:13:47,127 --> 00:13:48,395
TO STICK UP FOR TYLER,

550
00:13:48,395 --> 00:13:51,064
WITH MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS.

551
00:13:51,064 --> 00:13:51,932
I TRY NOT TO LET IT

552
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:52,933
BOTHER ME ANYMORE.

553
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:54,067
BUT SOMETIMES MY MOM

554
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,402
GOES TOO FAR.

555
00:13:55,402 --> 00:13:56,236
>> SO WHAT'S THE--

556
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:57,237
WHAT'S THE WORD?

557
00:13:57,237 --> 00:13:58,605
HOW'S IT GOING ON OVER THERE?

558
00:13:58,605 --> 00:13:59,239
WHAT'S--

559
00:13:59,239 --> 00:13:59,907
>> NOTHING.

560
00:13:59,907 --> 00:14:01,808
NOTHING'S CHANGED.

561
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:02,976
>> WELL, YOU JUST MENTIONED THAT

562
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,611
SHE GOT YOU A BASSINET.

563
00:14:04,611 --> 00:14:05,778
>> OH, YEAH.

564
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:06,980
UH, SHE SAID THAT SHE GOT IT

565
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:07,814
FROM--OH, I DON'T KNOW

566
00:14:07,814 --> 00:14:08,615
WHERE IT WAS, BUT--

567
00:14:08,615 --> 00:14:09,682
>> I DON'T CARE WHERE SHE GOT IT

568
00:14:09,682 --> 00:14:10,683
FROM, BUT I MEAN, WHY DID JEN

569
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:11,618
GET YOU A BASSINET?

570
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:13,286
>> OH, FOR HER HOUSE.

571
00:14:13,286 --> 00:14:13,954
>> OH.

572
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:14,922
IT AIN'T GONNA GET USED.

573
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:16,089
[laughter]

574
00:14:16,089 --> 00:14:17,925
YOU BETTER TELL HER.

575
00:14:17,925 --> 00:14:19,092
I DON'T WANT TO WASTE HER MONEY.

576
00:14:19,092 --> 00:14:20,027
BECAUSE IT WON'T GET USED

577
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:22,762
OVER THERE.

578
00:14:22,762 --> 00:14:23,763
>> I DON'T KNOW.

579
00:14:23,763 --> 00:14:24,597
>> NOT SO GOOD WITH

580
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:25,798
THE CLEANLINESS LIKE I AM.

581
00:14:25,798 --> 00:14:29,702
>> OH.

582
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:30,403
>> WHAT?

583
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:31,304
>> OOH.

584
00:14:31,304 --> 00:14:33,873
>> NO, SHE JUST WANTS TO BE

585
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,075
MOMMY WHEN I HAVE THE BABY,

586
00:14:35,075 --> 00:14:35,742
BASICALLY.

587
00:14:35,742 --> 00:14:36,809
>> WELL, LET'S REMEMBER YOU'RE

588
00:14:36,809 --> 00:14:38,278
MINE, AND WHAT'S YOURS IS MINE.

589
00:14:38,278 --> 00:14:39,512
>> ALL RIGHT, WELL, OKAY.

590
00:14:39,512 --> 00:14:40,513
>> I CAN EVEN DECIDE

591
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:41,514
ON THE DRUGS YOU GET.

592
00:14:41,514 --> 00:14:42,582
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

593
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:43,583
>> OKAY, THEN--

594
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,551
>> I HAVE TO SIGN PAPERS

595
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:45,285
FOR THAT.

596
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:46,019
>> OH, WE KNOW.

597
00:14:46,019 --> 00:14:49,422
THEN JUST DROP IT THEN.

598
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:50,623
[indistinct speech]

599
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:51,691
>> IT'S NOT YOUR KID.

600
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:52,459
WHERE'S MY BAG?

601
00:14:52,459 --> 00:14:54,327
>> BUT YOU'RE MY KID.

602
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:55,828
>> UM, HEY, JUST BE READY

603
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:56,829
TO COME GET ME 'CAUSE MY MOM'S

604
00:14:56,829 --> 00:14:57,730
BEING HERSELF RIGHT NOW,

605
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:58,365
YOU KNOW.

606
00:14:58,365 --> 00:15:00,333
SHE WANTS TO MAKE A BIG-ASS

607
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:03,470
SCENE ABOUT HOW BIG BOSS SHE IS,

608
00:15:03,470 --> 00:15:05,438
AND HOW ALL THE POWER SHE HAS.

609
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:06,306
>> SHE DON'T WANT TO

610
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:07,440
CHALLENGE ME.

611
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,875
YOU KNOW I LOVE A CHALLENGE.

612
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:09,943
I LOVE A CHALLENGE.

613
00:15:09,943 --> 00:15:10,677
YOU KNOW THAT.

614
00:15:10,677 --> 00:15:12,212
I LOVE A CHALLENGE.

615
00:15:12,212 --> 00:15:13,046
>> ARE YOU LEAVING?

616
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:13,813
ARE YOU LEAVING?

617
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:14,681
>> YOU'RE LEAVING NOW?

618
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:15,848
>> YEAH.

619
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:16,683
BYE.

620
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:17,517
I DIDN'T SEE YOU--

621
00:15:17,517 --> 00:15:18,986
>> YOU STILL HAVE FRIENDS HERE.

622
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:19,819
>> I DON'T EVEN KNOW

623
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:20,620
ANY OF THESE GIRLS.

624
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:21,388
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

625
00:15:21,388 --> 00:15:22,022
[scoffs]

626
00:15:22,022 --> 00:15:23,923
SHE'S LIKE, "I'M LEAVING."

627
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:29,362
>> SHE ALWAYS DOES THIS [bleep].

628
00:15:29,362 --> 00:15:30,763
ALWAYS MAKES A [bleep] BIG DEAL

629
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,399
OUT OF NOTHING.

630
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,600
YOU'RE GONNA INVITE ME OVER,

631
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:35,435
TALK [bleep] ABOUT ME,

632
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:37,770
MY BABY'S DADDY, AND LIKE--

633
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:38,705
>> SHE WAS TALKING [bleep]

634
00:15:38,705 --> 00:15:39,339
ABOUT ME?

635
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:40,273
>> TY, COME ON.

636
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,341
IT'S--

637
00:15:41,341 --> 00:15:42,409
>> YEAH, I KNOW, BUT LIKE,

638
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:44,011
AT THE BABY SHOWER--YOUR BABY

639
00:15:44,011 --> 00:15:49,349
SHOWER WITH ALL YOUR FRIENDS.

640
00:15:49,349 --> 00:15:51,851
>> SHE ALWAYS DOES THIS.

641
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:02,829
>> TYLER'S PARENTS COULD TELL

642
00:16:02,829 --> 00:16:03,763
I WAS PRETTY UPSET AFTER

643
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,065
MY SURPRISE BABY SHOWER

644
00:16:05,065 --> 00:16:05,732
YESTERDAY.

645
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:06,633
SO THEY WANTED TO KNOW

646
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:07,867
WHAT HAPPENED.

647
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:09,436
LIKE, IF NOTHING GOES HER WAY,

648
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:10,503
YOU KNOW, SHE WANTS TO PROVE

649
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:11,904
HOW BIG BOSS SHE IS.

650
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:14,041
SHE SAID, "YOU'RE GONNA NEED ME

651
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,108
FOR EVERYTHING,

652
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:16,243
FOR THE EPIDURAL.

653
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:17,777
YOU CAN'T EVEN GET THE EPIDURAL

654
00:16:17,777 --> 00:16:18,811
UNLESS A PARENT

655
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:20,813
IS THERE TO SIGN FOR IT."

656
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:21,848
>> WELL, WHAT KIND OF MOTHER

657
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:23,116
CALLS UP HER DAUGHTER AND GOES,

658
00:16:23,116 --> 00:16:24,384
"HA, HA, HA, YOU'RE GONNA NEED

659
00:16:24,384 --> 00:16:25,818
MY SIGNATURE, AND I'M NOT

660
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:27,054
GONNA GIVE IT TO YOU.

661
00:16:27,054 --> 00:16:29,056
TOO BAD, SWEETIE."

662
00:16:29,056 --> 00:16:31,891
FOR A FREAKING EPIDURAL.

663
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:33,226
>> ONE THAT'S THREE CARDS SHY OF

664
00:16:33,226 --> 00:16:34,961
A FULL DECK, IF YOU ASK ME.

665
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:36,529
>> SHE JUST THINKS THAT SHE'S

666
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:37,864
GONNA BREAK JORDAN AND JORDAN'S

667
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:39,932
GONNA CONFORM TO HER, AND

668
00:16:39,932 --> 00:16:41,468
THAT'S THE WAY IT'S GONNA BE.

669
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:42,569
>> WHAT DO YOU PLAN ON DOING

670
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:44,037
WITH THE CRIB THAT TYLER BOUGHT

671
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:45,938
YOU THAT'S ALREADY OVER THERE?

672
00:16:45,938 --> 00:16:47,040
>> I WANT TO GO GET IT.

673
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,275
>> YEAH.

674
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:49,442
>> AND HE BOUGHT IT FOR YOU.

675
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:50,943
HE DIDN'T BUY IT FOR YOUR MOM.

676
00:16:50,943 --> 00:16:52,412
>> SHE THINKS SHE HAS POWER OVER

677
00:16:52,412 --> 00:16:54,947
HER BECAUSE SHE HAS THIS CRIB.

678
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:55,982
AND WHEN ARE YOU GONNA TAKE AWAY

679
00:16:55,982 --> 00:16:57,117
THAT POWER?

680
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:58,318
>> EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE A

681
00:16:58,318 --> 00:16:59,752
BASSINET, I CAN'T JUST LET MY

682
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:00,953
MOM KEEP THE CRIB TYLER BOUGHT

683
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:02,722
FOR HIS BABY.

684
00:17:02,722 --> 00:17:03,856
BUT IF WE'RE EVER GONNA SEE IT

685
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:05,558
AGAIN, WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE

686
00:17:05,558 --> 00:17:10,797
IT WHEN SHE'S NOT AROUND.

687
00:17:10,797 --> 00:17:12,332
SO THE NEXT MORNING, WE DECIDED

688
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:13,900
TO GO GET IT BEFORE MY MOM GETS

689
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,602
HOME FROM THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT.

690
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:16,503
>> READY?

691
00:17:16,503 --> 00:17:17,470
>> SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

692
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,505
MOVE FAST.

693
00:17:18,505 --> 00:17:19,439
>> SO IS THE GAME PLAN

694
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:20,740
THE USUAL--

695
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,908
>> HURRY THE HELL UP

696
00:17:21,908 --> 00:17:23,143
AND GET THERE.

697
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:25,145
>> I'M GOING AS FAST AS I CAN.

698
00:17:25,145 --> 00:17:26,146
>> ALL RIGHT.

699
00:17:26,146 --> 00:17:26,846
>> ALL RIGHT,

700
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:28,715
LET'S GO GET THIS DONE.

701
00:17:31,918 --> 00:17:32,852
>> DO YOU HAVE THE PIECES?

702
00:17:32,852 --> 00:17:33,553
>> THE TOOLS?

703
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:34,154
>> YES.

704
00:17:34,154 --> 00:17:35,088
>> YES, THEY'RE IN MY HAND.

705
00:17:35,088 --> 00:17:38,991
>> PHEW.

706
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:41,861
>> [grunting]

707
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:43,363
>> TY.

708
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:44,497
I HAVE ANOTHER PIECE.

709
00:17:44,497 --> 00:17:45,198
HURRY UP.

710
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:45,932
>> ALL RIGHT.

711
00:17:45,932 --> 00:17:46,633
>> HURRY UP.

712
00:17:46,633 --> 00:17:47,334
GET IT DONE.

713
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:50,670
>> GOT THE OTHER BIG PIECE.

714
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,772
>> ONE MORE PIECE.

715
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:53,473
>> IS THAT--

716
00:17:53,473 --> 00:17:54,341
THAT'S IT THEN, RIGHT?

717
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:55,041
>> THAT'S IT.

718
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:57,076
LET'S BOUNCE. HURRY UP.

719
00:17:57,076 --> 00:18:00,213
>> ALL RIGHT, LET'S ROLL.

720
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:04,384
HIGH FIVE.

721
00:18:04,384 --> 00:18:07,019
>> WE GOT THE CRIB.

722
00:18:07,019 --> 00:18:08,521
YAY!

723
00:18:08,521 --> 00:18:10,857
I LOVE THIS CRIB.

724
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:11,791
>> DON'T YOU FEEL LIKE

725
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:13,226
WE'RE HAVING A BABY NOW?

726
00:18:13,226 --> 00:18:14,127
I THINK THERE'S MAGIC

727
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:16,196
ON THIS CRIB OR SOMETHING.

728
00:18:16,196 --> 00:18:17,564
>> MAYBE KNOWING THAT

729
00:18:17,564 --> 00:18:19,166
YOU GOT THIS FOR ME

730
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:21,368
MADE IT MORE VALUABLE.

731
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:22,569
>> EVEN IF SHE DOES TRY TO,

732
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:23,970
LIKE, PRESS CHARGES, WHATEVER,

733
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:25,104
I'M JUST GONNA BE LIKE,

734
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:26,339
"YOU SERIOUS?"

735
00:18:26,339 --> 00:18:27,106
THAT'S MY MONEY

736
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,343
THAT PAID FOR IT.

737
00:18:30,343 --> 00:18:31,711
>> I'M GLAD WE HAVE THE CRIB

738
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:32,979
AT TYLER'S HOUSE NOW.

739
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:33,880
BUT I'M SCARED OF WHAT'S

740
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,781
GONNA HAPPEN WHEN MY MOM

741
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:36,683
REALIZES IT'S GONE.

742
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:43,390
>> HI JORDAN.

743
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,391
>> HEY.

744
00:18:44,391 --> 00:18:45,091
HOW ARE YOU?

745
00:18:45,091 --> 00:18:46,058
>> I HAVE SOMETHING SO COOL

746
00:18:46,058 --> 00:18:47,394
TO SHOW YOU.

747
00:18:47,394 --> 00:18:49,729
ALL RIGHT, KEEP WALKING.

748
00:18:49,729 --> 00:18:50,730
KEEP WALKING.

749
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:51,398
SMACK.

750
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:52,064
>> [laughs]

751
00:18:52,064 --> 00:18:53,400
>> OKAY, NOW, OPEN UP YOUR EYES.

752
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,133
BOOM.

753
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,435
>> OH.

754
00:18:55,435 --> 00:18:57,204
YOU GOT THE CRIB ALL READY.

755
00:18:57,204 --> 00:18:59,105
IT LOOKS SO NICE.

756
00:18:59,105 --> 00:19:00,607
>> THIS WAS IN MY HOUSE.

757
00:19:00,607 --> 00:19:01,708
>> SO LIKE, IS ALL THE STUFF

758
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:02,775
FROM YOUR MOM'S HOUSE HERE?

759
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:04,377
>> NO, THIS IS WHAT HE BOUGHT.

760
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:05,545
>> WHAT DOES YOUR MOM THINK

761
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:06,779
ABOUT THE CRIB BEING HERE?

762
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:07,747
>> I HONESTLY DON'T THINK

763
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:09,148
SHE KNOWS YET.

764
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:09,949
>> OH, MY GOD.

765
00:19:09,949 --> 00:19:10,783
>> IT WAS IN MY ROOM.

766
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:12,018
>> [laughs]

767
00:19:12,018 --> 00:19:13,720
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GONNA

768
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,322
HAPPEN WHEN YOUR MOM FINDS OUT?

769
00:19:15,322 --> 00:19:16,423
>> I THINK SHE'S GONNA BE LIKE,

770
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:17,390
"I'M GONNA CALL THE COPS."

771
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,191
'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT

772
00:19:18,191 --> 00:19:18,958
SHE ALWAYS DOES.

773
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:19,959
>> SHE SHOULDN'T CALL THE COPS

774
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:20,560
THOUGH.

775
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:22,161
>> WELL, THAT'S MY MOM.

776
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,162
[phone beeps]

777
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,197
OH, WOW.

778
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:26,599
I HAVE A VOICEMAIL

779
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:28,501
AND TWO MISSED CALLS.

780
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,669
>> WHO ARE THEY FROM?

781
00:19:29,669 --> 00:19:30,603
>> MY MOM.

782
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:32,505
>> FIRST UNHEARD MESSAGE.

783
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:34,541
>> YOU [bleep] SLIMEBALL.

784
00:19:34,541 --> 00:19:36,175
YOU MOVED THAT [bleep] CRIB OUT?

785
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,510
WHO CARRIED THE CRIB OUT?

786
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,246
I KNOW IT WASN'T YOU.

787
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:40,880
DID YOU HAVE TYLER IN MY HOUSE?

788
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,781
YOU'RE JUST TOTALLY

789
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:42,515
DISRESPECTFUL.

790
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:43,350
SEE, I'VE BEEN TRYING

791
00:19:43,350 --> 00:19:44,217
TO BE NICE ABOUT THIS.

792
00:19:44,217 --> 00:19:45,218
DO YOU REALLY THINK I WOULD...

793
00:19:45,218 --> 00:19:46,018
>> NICE ABOUT WHAT?

794
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,019
>> LET THAT BABY MOVE IN THERE

795
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,388
SO YOU COULD PLAY HOUSE?

796
00:19:48,388 --> 00:19:49,856
YOU'RE PUTTING A LOT OF PEOPLE

797
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:51,224
IN A BAD SITUATION.

798
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:52,625
NOW, YOU THOUGHT IT WAS TALK

799
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,826
AND TALK AND TALK.

800
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:55,295
NO, I'M GONNA SHOW YOU THE WALK,

801
00:19:55,295 --> 00:19:56,263
WALK, THE REAL WALK.

802
00:19:56,263 --> 00:19:58,298
BECAUSE THIS IS [bleep],

803
00:19:58,298 --> 00:19:59,131
WHAT YOU JUST PULLED

804
00:19:59,131 --> 00:20:00,500
WITH THAT LITTLE [bleep].

805
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,434
>> WOW.

806
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:02,269
>> YEP. OH, WELL.

807
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:03,603
ANYWAYS...

808
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:04,971
IT'S STRESSFUL.

809
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:05,672
I DON'T KNOW.

810
00:20:05,672 --> 00:20:06,306
>> YEAH.

811
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:07,707
>> NOW I'M JUST GONNA

812
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:08,708
RELY ON TYLER.

813
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,409
>> YEAH.

814
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:10,443
>> SO I MEAN, LIKE,

815
00:20:10,443 --> 00:20:11,944
SAY I NEVER TOOK THE CRIB

816
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,045
AND STAYED AT MY HOUSE.

817
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:14,547
THINGS WOULD BE THE SAME.

818
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:15,382
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

819
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:16,182
SO WHY NOT TRY

820
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:19,952
A DIFFERENT METHOD?

821
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,254
I NEVER THOUGHT IT WOULD

822
00:20:21,254 --> 00:20:22,154
COME TO THIS

823
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:23,222
BETWEEN ME AND MY MOM.

824
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:25,258
I JUST CAN'T LET HER CUT TYLER

825
00:20:25,258 --> 00:20:27,159
OUT OF MY LIFE.

826
00:20:40,573 --> 00:20:42,375
[cell phone ringing]

827
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:43,543
>> MY DUE DATE IS JUST A WEEK

828
00:20:43,543 --> 00:20:44,844
AWAY, AND I HAVEN'T ANSWERED

829
00:20:44,844 --> 00:20:46,245
ANY OF MY MOM'S CALLS

830
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:47,314
SINCE SHE LEFT

831
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:48,915
THAT NASTY MESSAGE.

832
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:49,716
I FINISHED ALL OF

833
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:50,683
MY SCHOOL ASSIGNMENTS,

834
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:52,385
AND I'M OFFICIALLY A SENIOR.

835
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:53,653
SO I'M MEETING MY FRIENDS

836
00:20:53,653 --> 00:20:55,054
AT THE LIBRARY TO FIGURE OUT

837
00:20:55,054 --> 00:20:56,188
WHAT CLASSES WE'RE GONNA TAKE

838
00:20:56,188 --> 00:20:57,056
NEXT YEAR.

839
00:20:57,056 --> 00:20:57,890
>> HEY, GIRL.

840
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:58,758
>> HEY.

841
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,393
>> LOOK AT YOU GETTING ALL BIG.

842
00:21:00,393 --> 00:21:01,060
>> YEAH.

843
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,028
>> SO YOU'RE GOING TO SCHOOL

844
00:21:02,028 --> 00:21:02,695
NEXT YEAR?

845
00:21:02,695 --> 00:21:03,630
LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

846
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,831
>> I'M GONNA GO TO THAT

847
00:21:04,831 --> 00:21:06,065
TECH SCHOOL THAT YOU'RE IN.

848
00:21:06,065 --> 00:21:07,233
>> THE CTC.

849
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:07,934
>> YEAH.

850
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:08,835
>> WHO'S GONNA TAKE CARE

851
00:21:08,835 --> 00:21:09,736
OF THE BABY?

852
00:21:09,736 --> 00:21:11,604
>> UM, I KNOW MY MOM'S GONNA

853
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:12,839
WANT TO.

854
00:21:12,839 --> 00:21:13,606
>> DEFINITELY.

855
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:15,207
>> BUT IF SHE DOESN'T,

856
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:17,276
I DON'T HAVE A PLAN "B"

857
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,111
FOR THAT JUST YET.

858
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,212
>> 'CAUSE YOU'RE BASICALLY

859
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:22,615
DEPENDING ON TY, RIGHT?

860
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:25,151
>> AT THE MOMENT, YEAH, I GUESS.

861
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:26,152
>> AND YOU'RE NOT EVEN REALLY

862
00:21:26,152 --> 00:21:27,119
RELYING ON TYLER.

863
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,988
YOU'RE RELYING ON HIS PARENTS.

864
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:33,493
YOU CAN'T ALWAYS KIND OF, LIKE,

865
00:21:33,493 --> 00:21:35,161
RELY ON HIS PARENTS.

866
00:21:35,161 --> 00:21:35,995
SO THEN YOU'RE GONNA

867
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:36,696
GO BACK HOME.

868
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:37,864
>> DON'T YOU NEED A SECOND PLAN,

869
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:38,765
YOU THINK?

870
00:21:38,765 --> 00:21:40,633
>> I DO.

871
00:21:44,437 --> 00:21:49,308
>> I'M NOT HAVING A BABY.

872
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,877
>> I'M GRATEFUL FOR TY

873
00:21:50,877 --> 00:21:51,778
AND HIS PARENTS,

874
00:21:51,778 --> 00:21:53,513
BUT IT BUMS ME OUT THAT

875
00:21:53,513 --> 00:21:55,515
ME AND MY MOM AREN'T TALKING.

876
00:21:55,515 --> 00:21:57,249
AND I DOUBT SHE'LL EVER FORGIVE

877
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:58,451
ME FOR TAKING THAT CRIB

878
00:21:58,451 --> 00:22:00,987
FROM HER HOUSE.

879
00:22:00,987 --> 00:22:02,389
BUT WHEN I GOT BACK TO TYLER'S

880
00:22:02,389 --> 00:22:04,391
HOUSE, MY MOM SENT ME AN EMAIL

881
00:22:04,391 --> 00:22:05,257
APOLOGIZING FOR

882
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:06,659
THE VOICEMAIL MESSAGE

883
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:07,560
AND SAYING SHE WANTS TO

884
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:08,395
WORK THINGS OUT

885
00:22:08,395 --> 00:22:13,165
WITH BOTH ME AND TYLER.

886
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,467
>> 'CAUSE WHEN I CAME HOME

887
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:15,702
FROM WORK AND I WENT IN THERE,

888
00:22:15,702 --> 00:22:17,870
AND WHEN I SAW THE CRIB GONE,

889
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:19,506
AND THEN I CHECKED THE CLOSET

890
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:22,041
AND ALL THE BABY STUFF WAS GONE,

891
00:22:22,041 --> 00:22:22,909
I FELT LIKE THERE WAS

892
00:22:22,909 --> 00:22:24,210
A DAGGER IN MY BACK.

893
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:26,212
YOU KNOW, I JUST WAS SO CRUSHED.

894

I FELT LIKE I LOST A CHILD.

895
00:22:27,547 --> 00:22:28,548
I MEAN, IT HURT.

896
00:22:28,548 --> 00:22:29,582
IT'S A FEELING I DON'T WANT TO

897

STRONGLY ABOUT MOVING IN THERE

900
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:34,821
TO BE WITH HIM.

901
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:35,488
I DON'T--

902
00:22:35,488 --> 00:22:37,089
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT.

903

907
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:46,833
DON'T GET ALONG,

908
00:22:46,833 --> 00:22:47,900
AND I JUST KNEW THAT HE WASN'T

909
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,736
ALLOWED TO COME OVER.

910
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:50,703
I DIDN'T WANT TO, LIKE,

911

>> YOU WOULDN'T HAVE LOST ME.

914
00:22:55,174 --> 00:22:57,610
YOU COULD NEVER LOSE YOUR MOM.

915
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,344
I WAS HURT.

916
00:22:58,344 --> 00:23:00,580
BUT LOST?

917
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,448
NO, IT WOULD HAVE NEVER

918
00:23:01,448 --> 00:23:02,114

COME OVER AND SEE THE BABY

940
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,780
ANY TIME HE WANTED.

941
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,381
WHEN I TOLD TYLER ABOUT IT,

942
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:37,049
HE WAS A LITTLE SKEPTICAL

943
00:23:37,049 --> 00:23:38,150
OF HER INTENTIONS,

944
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:39,185
BUT AGREED TO COME OVER

945
00:23:39,185 --> 00:23:41,053
AND HEAR WHAT SHE HAD TO SAY.

946
00:23:41,053 --> 00:23:41,821
>> HOW YOU DOING?

947
00:23:41,821 --> 00:23:42,455
>> HELLO.

948
00:23:42,455 --> 00:23:44,924
MY PROPOSAL WAS THAT I WANTED

949
00:23:44,924 --> 00:23:47,059
TO BASICALLY HAVE AN OPEN DOOR.

950
00:23:47,059 --> 00:23:48,595
YOU KNOW, WHERE YOU CAN COME

951
00:23:48,595 --> 00:23:49,696
AND VISIT AND BE A PART

952
00:23:49,696 --> 00:23:50,897
OF THE BABY'S LIFE.

953
00:23:50,897 --> 00:23:52,098
YOU'RE MORE THAN WELCOME

954
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:52,932
TO COME HERE.

955
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:54,601
I WORK THIRD SHIFT.

956
00:23:54,601 --> 00:23:56,302
I'M SLEEPING DURING THE DAYTIME.

957
00:23:56,302 --> 00:23:57,604
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DEAL WITH ME.

958
00:23:57,604 --> 00:23:58,370
YOU KNOW, IF YOU

959
00:23:58,370 --> 00:23:59,606
WANT TO SEE THEM TWO.

960
00:23:59,606 --> 00:24:00,607
>> AND THE WHOLE REASON WHY

961
00:24:00,607 --> 00:24:02,875
I WAS GONNA MOVE TO YOUR HOUSE

962
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,544
WAS BECAUSE I THOUGHT

963
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:05,678
YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE

964
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:06,445
TO SEE YOUR BABY.

965
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:07,413
>> ONLY--LIKE, I DID--

966
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:09,782
LIKE, I'M...

967
00:24:09,782 --> 00:24:11,851
I AM A LITTLE HESITANT ABOUT IT.

968
00:24:11,851 --> 00:24:13,553
'CAUSE TO ME, IT MAKES YOU LOOK

969
00:24:13,553 --> 00:24:15,054
LIKE YOU JUST WANT THIS BABY

970
00:24:15,054 --> 00:24:16,022
ALL TO YOURSELF.

971
00:24:16,022 --> 00:24:16,823
>> I WANT TO MOVE

972
00:24:16,823 --> 00:24:18,658
FROM TODAY FORWARD,

973
00:24:18,658 --> 00:24:20,627
WITH A FRESH START WITH US.

974
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:21,494
BUT YOUR POINT IS,

975
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:22,762
I CAN JUST COME OVER--

976
00:24:22,762 --> 00:24:23,563
>> ANY--IT'S OPEN.

977
00:24:23,563 --> 00:24:24,831
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

978
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:25,998
I FEEL A LOT BETTER.

979
00:24:25,998 --> 00:24:26,766
LIKE--

980
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:28,735
I CAN'T HAVE MY BABY DADDY AND

981
00:24:28,735 --> 00:24:29,836
MY MOM NOT LIKING EACH OTHER

982
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:31,337
OR ALWAYS ARGUING,

983
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:32,705
JUST NOT GETTING ALONG.

984
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:35,374
IT JUST WASN'T RIGHT.

985
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:37,043
AND I WAS JUST SO UPSET.

986
00:24:37,043 --> 00:24:38,978
I WAS EMOTIONALLY UPSET.

987
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:39,979
>> BUT THANKS FOR COMING.

988
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:40,980
I DO APPRECIATE IT.

989
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:41,848
I'M GLAD WE GOT IT OUT.

990
00:24:41,848 --> 00:24:42,481
>> RIGHT.

991
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:43,349
ARE YOU COMING WITH ME

992
00:24:43,349 --> 00:24:44,183
OR ARE YOU STAYING--

993
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:45,051
>> NO, I'M STAYING HERE

994
00:24:45,051 --> 00:24:45,885
AND GET MY GRUB ON.

995
00:24:45,885 --> 00:24:46,919
>> YEAH, WE'RE GOING OUT TO EAT.

996
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:47,720
WE'RE OUT OF HERE.

997
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,487
>> I'LL SEE YOU.

998
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:49,121
>> LATER.

999
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:52,659
>> ALL RIGHTY.

1000
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:53,993
>> WHAT'S GOING ON?

1001
00:24:53,993 --> 00:24:55,227
AFTER EVERYTHING HER MOTHER'S

1002
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:56,996
DONE, SHE'S GONNA DO

1003
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,365
AN ABOUT-FACE AND GO OVER THERE

1004
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:00,366
AND HANG OUT WITH HER

1005
00:25:00,366 --> 00:25:01,233
LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED?

1006
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:02,635
>> YEAH, BUT JORDAN ACTUALLY

1007
00:25:02,635 --> 00:25:03,736
TOLD ME THE ONLY REASON WHY

1008
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:05,037
SHE CAME HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE

1009
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:08,307
WAS BECAUSE KELLY KEPT SAYING

1010
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:09,842
I'M NOT GONNA BE ALLOWED

1011
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:10,543
IN THE HOUSE.

1012
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:11,844
BUT NOW THAT SHE'S ALLOWING ME

1013
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:13,012
IN THE HOUSE, THAT'S WHY

1014
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:16,148
SHE'S PLANNING ON GOING BACK.

1015
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:17,884
SHE WANTS US TO FEEL WELCOME TO

1016
00:25:17,884 --> 00:25:19,151
GO OVER THERE.

1017
00:25:19,151 --> 00:25:19,952
>> IT'S A MATTER OF

1018
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:21,220
WHETHER SHE REALLY MEANS IT.

1019
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,421
THAT'S ALL WELL AND GOOD

1020
00:25:22,421 --> 00:25:24,156
IF SHE'S SERIOUS.

1021
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:25,124
>> I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU,

1022
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:26,125
I WAS GONNA SAY A FEW THINGS

1023
00:25:26,125 --> 00:25:27,459
OR ASK A FEW THINGS,

1024
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:28,494
BUT I FELT UNCOMFORTABLE

1025
00:25:28,494 --> 00:25:30,029
WHILE BEING AT HER HOUSE.

1026
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,297
>> I'M STILL--I'M A LITTLE BIT

1027
00:25:31,297 --> 00:25:32,732
CONCERNED AS TO HOW THIS

1028
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:34,734
IS GONNA ALL PAN OUT.

1029
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:35,602
>> THE ONLY THING THAT

1030
00:25:35,602 --> 00:25:37,103
I'M REALLY CONCERNED WITH NOW

1031
00:25:37,103 --> 00:25:39,238
IS THAT I'M GONNA END UP

1032
00:25:39,238 --> 00:25:41,240
NOT SEEING MY SON.

1033
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:43,743
I WORRY THAT SHE'S GONNA LET HER

1034
00:25:43,743 --> 00:25:45,211
MOM TALK HER INTO DOING THINGS

1035
00:25:45,211 --> 00:25:47,479
THAT SHE WOULDN'T DO.

1036
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:48,247
>> KELLY LIKES TO

1037
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:49,381
CALL THE SHOTS.

1038
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:50,316
AND THE WAY SHE'S BEEN

1039
00:25:50,316 --> 00:25:51,450
TRYING TO CALL IT,

1040
00:25:51,450 --> 00:25:53,720
IT'S NOT EXACTLY IN OUR FAVOR.

1041
00:26:05,131 --> 00:26:06,132
>> ALL RIGHT, NOW HOW ABOUT

1042
00:26:06,132 --> 00:26:07,366
LET'S START MEASURING

1043
00:26:07,366 --> 00:26:09,368
AND THEN CUTTING THE PIECES.

1044
00:26:09,368 --> 00:26:11,437
TODAY'S MY DUE DATE,

1045
00:26:11,437 --> 00:26:12,605
BUT I HAVEN'T HAD

1046
00:26:12,605 --> 00:26:14,140
ANY CONTRACTIONS YET.

1047
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:14,974
I FEEL LIKE

1048
00:26:14,974 --> 00:26:16,042
WE'RE SLAPPING WATER ON ME.

1049
00:26:16,042 --> 00:26:17,543
TYLER HAS BEEN KIND OF DISTANT

1050
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:19,245
SINCE OUR TALK, AND I CAN TELL

1051
00:26:19,245 --> 00:26:21,247
HE'S NOT HAPPY ABOUT MY DECISION

1052
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,549
TO BRING THE BABY BACK HERE.

1053
00:26:23,549 --> 00:26:24,483
>> HOW'S EVERYTHING GOING

1054
00:26:24,483 --> 00:26:25,317
WITH YOU AND TYLER?

1055
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:26,919
I KNOW THINGS KEEP CHANGING...

1056
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:27,586
>> YEAH.

1057
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:28,755
>> AT ANY GIVEN MOMENT, SO--

1058
00:26:28,755 --> 00:26:30,589
>> IT'S LIKE, I JUST THINK IT

1059
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:31,791
HAS TO SINK IN.

1060
00:26:31,791 --> 00:26:33,259
WE'LL BE, LIKE, HAPPY, SAD--

1061
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:34,526
>> HE'S EXPECTING YOU TO BE,

1062
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:35,962
LIKE, YOU KNOW, OVER THERE,

1063
00:26:35,962 --> 00:26:37,563
HIS MOM, HIS DAD,

1064
00:26:37,563 --> 00:26:39,899
HIS GIRLFRIEND, HIS BABY.

1065
00:26:39,899 --> 00:26:41,300
AND THEN THE WALL

1066
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,301
COMES TUMBLING DOWN

1067
00:26:42,301 --> 00:26:43,602
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THAT WAS

1068
00:26:43,602 --> 00:26:45,705
NEVER, EVER MOM'S INTENTIONS.

1069
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:46,806
WOW.

1070
00:26:46,806 --> 00:26:47,774
THIS IS SUPER HARD.

1071
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:48,708
NOW I'M WORRIED WE'RE NOT

1072
00:26:48,708 --> 00:26:49,676
GONNA BE ABLE TO CUT IT OFF.

1073
00:26:49,676 --> 00:26:50,376
[chime dings]

1074
00:26:50,376 --> 00:26:51,343
>> WE FINISHED MY BELLY CAST

1075
00:26:51,343 --> 00:26:52,311
JUST IN TIME,

1076
00:26:52,311 --> 00:26:53,479
BECAUSE LATER THAT MORNING...

1077
00:26:53,479 --> 00:26:54,480
[knocking]

1078
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,682
MY WATER BROKE,

1079
00:26:55,682 --> 00:26:56,482
AND IT WAS TIME

1080
00:26:56,482 --> 00:26:58,350
TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL.

1081
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:15,768
A COUPLE HOURS LATER, THE

1082
00:27:15,768 --> 00:27:17,670
CONTRACTIONS GOT EVEN WORSE.

1083
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,604
SO I WAS HAPPY

1084
00:27:18,604 --> 00:27:20,472
TO GET AN EPIDURAL.

1085
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:24,543
>> UNFORTUNATELY, EPIDURALS

1086
00:27:24,543 --> 00:27:26,979
DON'T TAKE AWAY THE PRESSURE.

1087
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:27,980
WE WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO FEEL

1088
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,081
THAT SO WHEN IT COMES TIME

1089
00:27:29,081 --> 00:27:30,316
FOR US TO BE ABLE TO PUSH,

1090
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:32,151
YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHERE TO PUSH.

1091
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:32,785
>> OKAY.

1092
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:33,652
I SERIOUSLY FEEL LIKE

1093
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,521
IT'S COMING OR SOMETHING.

1094
00:27:35,521 --> 00:27:37,323
>> SHE GOT THAT STANK FACE ON.

1095
00:27:37,323 --> 00:27:38,157
[laughter]

1096
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:39,425
>> SUDDENLY, I STARTED

1097
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:41,360
TO FEEL A LOT OF PRESSURE.

1098
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,161
AND MY DOCTOR SAID

1099
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:42,995
IT WAS TIME TO PUSH.

1100
00:27:42,995 --> 00:27:44,330
>> SHE NEEDS HER GLASSES NOW.

1101
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:45,732
CAN YOU SEE?

1102
00:27:45,732 --> 00:27:47,133
>> PULL FORWARD, PULL FORWARD.

1103
00:27:47,133 --> 00:27:48,835
>> LIKE YOU DID YOUR NECK, YEAH.

1104
00:27:48,835 --> 00:27:49,501
LIKE THAT.

1105
00:27:49,501 --> 00:27:50,970
PULL HARD.

1106
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:51,871
KEEP PULLING.

1107
00:27:51,871 --> 00:27:52,604
NICE AND EASY.

1108
00:27:52,604 --> 00:27:53,672
GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD.

1109
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:54,573
KEEP COMING.

1110
00:27:54,573 --> 00:27:55,341
GOOD. THAT'S IT.

1111
00:27:55,341 --> 00:27:56,575
>> OH, MY GOD.

1112
00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:57,309
>> KEEP COMING.

1113
00:27:57,309 --> 00:27:58,577
GOOD WORK. COME ON.

1114
00:27:58,577 --> 00:27:59,278
COME ON.

1115
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:00,179
A LITTLE BIT MORE.

1116
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:00,880
THAT'S IT.

1117
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,613
>> OH, MY GOD.

1118
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:03,082
>> KEEP COMING.

1119
00:28:03,082 --> 00:28:04,183
KEEP PUSHING A LITTLE BIT MORE.

1120
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,384
>> HERE COMES THAT HEAD.

1121
00:28:05,384 --> 00:28:07,419
>> BIG, DEEP BREATHS.

1122
00:28:07,419 --> 00:28:08,054
>> OKAY.

1123
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:08,988

SAID HE HAD OTHER THINGS TO DO.

00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:21,160
FOR HIM TO SPEND THE NIGHT.

IT'S NOT ALL HIS MOTHER'S FAULT.

1196
00:30:34,666 --> 00:30:36,969

NIGHTS ARE THE WORST,

1253
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:52,004
TYLER ALWAYS HAS AN EXCUSE

TO WHY HE DOESN'T CALL

1255
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,740

I KNOW HE AND HIS FAMILY FEEL

BURNED BY MY DECISION TO MOVE

1258

BACK HOME, BUT I DON'T

1259
00:32:59,011 --> 00:33:00,012
UNDERSTAND WHY THAT WOULD KEEP

THEM FROM VISITING CHASE.

1261
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,382

INVITED THEM OVER, AND

1263
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:06,918

OF MISUNDERSTANDINGS

1299
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:48,327
AND A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS

1300

00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:00,439
TO MOVE OVER, BUT I PERSONALLY

1308
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:03,609
MADE A DIFFERENT DECISION.

1309
00:34:03,609 --> 00:34:04,510
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST--

1310
00:34:04,510 --> 00:34:05,577
IT'S JUST I THINK TYLER'S

1311
00:34:05,577 --> 00:34:06,978
HAVING A HARD TIME TOO.

1312
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:09,181
LIKE, HE'S--HE WAS EXPECTING YOU

1313
00:34:09,181 --> 00:34:10,516
TO COME BACK TO OUR HOUSE,

1314
00:34:10,516 --> 00:34:11,850
AND YOU KNOW,

1315
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,219
WITH GETTING THE CRIB AND STUFF,

1316
00:34:13,219 --> 00:34:14,453
AND I THINK HE MIGHT BE

1317
00:34:14,453 --> 00:34:15,987
HAVING A HARD TIME.

1318
00:34:15,987 --> 00:34:16,922
>> TO ME, IT SEEMS LIKE

1319
00:34:16,922 --> 00:34:17,823
HE DOESN'T REALLY WANT TO

1320
00:34:17,823 --> 00:34:18,824
MEET HER HALFWAY HERE.

1321
00:34:18,824 --> 00:34:19,625
HE DOESN'T SHOW UP

1322
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:20,892
A LOT OF THE TIMES OR--

1323
00:34:20,892 --> 00:34:22,128
>> DO YOU THINK TYLER THINKS

1324
00:34:22,128 --> 00:34:23,195
HE'S NOT NEEDED?

1325
00:34:23,195 --> 00:34:24,496
>> YOU GOT TO FIGURE, JORDAN,

1326
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:25,997
HE WAS EXPECTING EVERYTHING

1327
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:27,099
TO BE A LOT DIFFERENT, AND

1328
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:28,534
THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKED OUT.

1329
00:34:28,534 --> 00:34:29,868
SO IT'S A MAJOR ADJUSTMENT

1330
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:30,536
FOR HIM.

1331
00:34:30,536 --> 00:34:31,870
>> HE'S NOT CALLING YOU AT ALL?

1332
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,505
>> NO.

1333
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:34,940
LIKE, YOU DON'T MAKE AN ATTEMPT

1334
00:34:34,940 --> 00:34:36,041
TO CALL, YOU DON'T MAKE AN

1335
00:34:36,041 --> 00:34:37,143
ATTEMPT TO TEXT, YOU DON'T MAKE

1336
00:34:37,143 --> 00:34:38,210
AN ATTEMPT TO REALLY COME HERE

1337
00:34:38,210 --> 00:34:39,411
AS OFTEN, SO YOU THINK I WOULD

1338
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:40,646
JUST GIVE HIM TO YOU?

1339
00:34:40,646 --> 00:34:41,747
>> THE ONLY THING I CAN FIGURE

1340
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:43,449
IS, HE'S JUST REALLY MAD

1341
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:45,351
BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T--

1342
00:34:45,351 --> 00:34:46,352
YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND.

1343
00:34:46,352 --> 00:34:47,386
YOU DIDN'T COME BACK THERE

1344
00:34:47,386 --> 00:34:48,354
WITH HIM.

1345
00:34:48,354 --> 00:34:49,521
WE'LL DEFINITELY TALK TO TYLER,

1346
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:50,222
AND--

1347
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:51,223
>> HE'LL COME AROUND.

1348
00:34:51,223 --> 00:34:53,024
IT'S JUST, HE'S YOUNG.

1349
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:54,226
>> WELL, THANKS FOR LETTING US

1350
00:34:54,226 --> 00:34:55,294
HOLD HIM FOR A LITTLE BIT.

1351
00:34:55,294 --> 00:34:56,695
WE'LL SEE YOU LATER.

1352
00:34:56,695 --> 00:34:57,596
>> ALL RIGHT.

1353
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:58,397
>> SEE YOU, JORDAN.

1354
00:34:58,397 --> 00:34:59,030

>> SEE YOU, LITTLE GUY.

1356
00:35:03,034 --> 00:35:04,336
>> TYLER'S PARENTS MUST HAVE

1357
00:35:04,336 --> 00:35:05,271
SAID SOMETHING TO HIM

1358
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:06,305
ABOUT COMING AROUND MORE,

1359
00:35:06,305 --> 00:35:07,406

I HAVEN'T SEEN HIM IN A WHILE.

1490
00:38:41,687 --> 00:38:42,688
>> THAT'S NOT MY FAULT.

1491
00:38:42,688 --> 00:38:43,622
YOU WERE ABLE TO COME HERE

1492
00:38:43,622 --> 00:38:44,623
ANY OTHER DAY; NOW YOU WANT TO

1493
00:38:44,623 --> 00:38:45,457
COME INSIDE MY HOUSE

1494
00:38:45,457 --> 00:38:47,125
AND START DEMANDING STUFF.

1495
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:54,566
>> I JUST WANT TO SEE HIM FOR--

1496
00:38:54,566 --> 00:38:55,734
>> YES, ANY OTHER TIME DURING

1497
00:38:55,734 --> 00:38:56,668
THE DAY, YOU CAN COME OVER

1498
00:38:56,668 --> 00:38:57,302
WHENEVER.

1499
00:38:57,302 --> 00:38:57,969
>> [bleep].

1500
00:38:57,969 --> 00:38:59,204
YOU NEVER TELL ME [bleep].

1501
00:38:59,204 --> 00:39:00,739
>> OKAY, SO YOU'RE GONNA COME UP

1502
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:01,740
IN MY HOUSE AND START CUSSING,

1503
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:02,340
RIGHT?

1504
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,174
>> SURE.

1505
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:06,077
>> ALL RIGHT, THEN LEAVE.

1506
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:07,679
>> [bleep] YOU ALL.

1507
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:08,580
>> [indistinct shouting]

1508
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,315
NO, GUYS!

1509
00:39:10,315 --> 00:39:11,617
JORDAN, GO GET THE BABY.

1510
00:39:11,617 --> 00:39:13,819
JORDAN, I PUT HIM IN THE BOPPIE.

1511
00:39:13,819 --> 00:39:14,786
YO, MIKE!

1512
00:39:14,786 --> 00:39:15,887
I'M NOT PLAYING.

1513
00:39:15,887 --> 00:39:18,056
I'M TELLING YOU AND DOMINIC, NO.

1514
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:19,558
YOU AIN'T READY FOR THAT.

1515
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:21,893
LET'S GO.

1516
00:39:21,893 --> 00:39:23,595
YOU IS NOT READY FOR THAT.

1517
00:39:23,595 --> 00:39:24,896
BUT YOU SHOULD BE READY

1518
00:39:24,896 --> 00:39:26,765
WHEN YOU TALK THAT BIG TALK.

1519
00:39:31,069 --> 00:39:32,971
>> [sighs]

1520
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:37,108
>> THIS IS REALLY IT.

1521
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:39,678
THIS IS THE END OF US.

1522
00:39:39,678 --> 00:39:41,580
I BELIEVE THAT HE WANTS NOTHING

1523
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,081
TO DO WITH CHASE

1524
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:44,416
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T COME AROUND

1525
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:46,117
FOR CHASE.

1526
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:48,119
HE DOESN'T--HE HASN'T

1527
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,220
GOTTEN CHASE ANYTHING

1528
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:52,458
SINCE HE WAS BORN.

1529
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:53,391
HE DOESN'T THINK

1530
00:39:53,391 --> 00:39:55,627
HE HAS TO DO ANYTHING.

1531
00:39:55,627 --> 00:39:56,695
LIKE, I WANT TO GET FULL

1532
00:39:56,695 --> 00:39:58,329
CUSTODY OF CHASE.

1533
00:39:58,329 --> 00:39:59,330
>> I THINK WE SHOULD.

1534
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,832
WHAT DOES HE DO FOR HIM?

1535
00:40:00,832 --> 00:40:02,468
AND I MEAN, AS FAR AS COMING TO

1536
00:40:02,468 --> 00:40:04,936
VISIT HIM, JUST BRINGING HIM

1537
00:40:04,936 --> 00:40:06,271
STUFF OR BUYING HIM STUFF

1538
00:40:06,271 --> 00:40:07,005
OR JUST--

1539
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:07,973
>> I MEAN, LIKE NEVER ONCE--

1540
00:40:07,973 --> 00:40:08,907
I NEVER SAID "NEVER COME"

1541
00:40:08,907 --> 00:40:09,608
OR ANYTHING.

1542
00:40:09,608 --> 00:40:10,442
>> WE DIDN'T, BUT I'M

1543
00:40:10,442 --> 00:40:11,409
AT THE POINT WHERE I'M GOOD

1544
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,011
THAT HE DOESN'T.

1545
00:40:13,011 --> 00:40:14,379
>> I JUST CAN'T TAKE ANOTHER

1546
00:40:14,379 --> 00:40:17,315
HEARTBREAK RIGHT NOW.

1547
00:40:17,315 --> 00:40:18,216
IT'S JUST TOO MUCH

1548
00:40:18,216 --> 00:40:19,117
FOR ME AND CHASE.

1549
00:40:19,117 --> 00:40:20,952
I GOT TO FOCUS ON CHASE.

1550
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:22,788
MY FOCUS SHOULD NOT EVER BE

1551
00:40:22,788 --> 00:40:24,890
ON A MAN OVER MY CHILD.

1552
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:25,891
>> SO, LIKE, ARE YOU GOING TO

1553
00:40:25,891 --> 00:40:27,092
SCHOOL NEXT YEAR?

1554
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:28,494
>> I'M DROPPING OUT.

1555
00:40:28,494 --> 00:40:30,295
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1556
00:40:30,295 --> 00:40:31,663
IT'S UP TO YOU WHAT YOU DO.

1557
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:32,831
I JUST WANT TO SEE YOU SUCCEED

1558
00:40:32,831 --> 00:40:34,332
FOR YOUR SON.

1559
00:40:34,332 --> 00:40:35,867
>> BEING A MOM AND GOING TO

1560
00:40:35,867 --> 00:40:39,137
SCHOOL, IT'S NOT A GOOD MIX,

1561
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:41,272
AND I CAN'T DO THOSE THINGS

1562
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,174
WITH CHASE.

1563
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:45,677
SO I GOT TO TAKE ONE STEP

1564
00:40:45,677 --> 00:40:47,679
AT A TIME INSTEAD OF

1565
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:51,517
THINKING I CAN DO ANYTHING.

1566
00:40:51,517 --> 00:40:53,885
THIS WHOLE SITUATION IS TOUGH.

1567
00:40:53,885 --> 00:40:55,353
IT REALLY WOKE ME UP.

1568
00:40:55,353 --> 00:40:59,290
LIKE, DON'T GET PREGNANT.

1569
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:00,225
DON'T THINK THAT

1570
00:41:00,225 --> 00:41:01,059
YOU'RE INVINCIBLE,

1571
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:02,961
'CAUSE YOU'RE NOT.

1572
00:41:17,509 --> 00:41:18,409
>> SO YOU THINK YOUR MOM

1573
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:19,477
IS OFF DRUGS AND STUFF?

1574
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,245
>> I DON'T THINK

1575
00:41:20,245 --> 00:41:21,513
SHE STOPPED DRINKING.

1576
00:41:21,513 --> 00:41:23,481
>> IT'S NO SECRET

1577
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:25,551
THAT I HAVE A DRUG ADDICTION.

1578
00:41:25,551 --> 00:41:27,485
>> TELL MAMA ALL ABOUT IT.

1579
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:28,820
>> CAN I HOLD MY GRANDBABY NOW?

1580
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,821
>> NO, I'M HOLDING HIM NOW.

1581
00:41:29,821 --> 00:41:31,790
>> GIMME THE BABY.

1582
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:32,724
>> I DON'T WANT MY BABY TO

1583
00:41:32,724 --> 00:41:34,425
BE AROUND SOMEBODY LIKE THAT.
