when you say that.

176
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,942
I think they feel relief.

177
00:06:31,045 --> 00:06:32,219
You feel relieved
to hear her say that?

178
00:06:32,322 --> 00:06:33,807
Or do you feel guilty?

179
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,325
>>: Guilty.>>: It is my choice.

180
00:06:35,429 --> 00:06:37,051
You know, no one forced me
to do it.

181
00:06:37,155 --> 00:06:38,846
So no one can feel guilty
for my actions.

182
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,193
>>: Yeah. Are you at school now?>>: Yeah, I'm at school.

183
00:06:41,297 --> 00:06:42,194
>>: So you're doing
what you need to do?

184
00:06:42,298 --> 00:06:43,092
>>: Yeah.>>: Have you had

185
00:06:43,195 --> 00:06:44,542
to sacrifice school?

186
00:06:45,025 --> 00:06:45,853
Briana?

187
00:06:46,302 --> 00:06:48,442
>>: No. Well,
in a sense, yeah.

188
00:06:48,546 --> 00:06:50,479
Because since I don't have
any babysitter

189
00:06:50,582 --> 00:06:51,549
to watch Nova,

190
00:06:51,963 --> 00:06:55,311
I can't just
get up and go to school.

191
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,933
I've to think about her.[Drew] How about socially?

192
00:06:57,037 --> 00:06:58,901
>>: Oh, I have no friends.

193
00:06:59,004 --> 00:07:00,627
[Drew] Yeah.>>: Everybody just left.

194
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:03,215
>>: This is something we hear
from the teen moms a lot.

195
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:04,527
They feel very alone.

196
00:07:05,252 --> 00:07:08,324
You imagine it to be
as most teen moms do,

197
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,327
flowers and snow flakes.>>: Yeah. It's like...

198
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:14,537
>>: And the perfect family where
the dad is gonna stick around

199
00:07:14,641 --> 00:07:16,608
and form a perfect unit
with you.

200
00:07:16,712 --> 00:07:19,369
Statistically, it almost
never happens like that.

201
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:20,474
>>: No.

202
00:07:20,578 --> 00:07:21,682
>>: Okay.

203
00:07:21,786 --> 00:07:23,373
Britney, Roxanne,
thank you for joining us today.

204
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:24,892
We're gonna take
a quick break

205
00:07:24,996 --> 00:07:27,101
and then Devon is gonna
come on out here and join us.

206
00:07:27,205 --> 00:07:28,517
So do not go away.

207
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:30,760
[applauding]

208
00:07:38,975 --> 00:07:42,151
[applauding]

209
00:07:43,221 --> 00:07:44,947
>>: Welcome back
to Life After Labor,

210
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,707
the 16 and Pregnant
finale special.

211
00:07:46,811 --> 00:07:49,503
I'm Dr. Drew and I've been
chatting with Briana.

212
00:07:49,607 --> 00:07:51,609
Now, it's time to bring
the father of her baby

213
00:07:51,712 --> 00:07:52,886
into the conversation.

214
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:54,370
Devon, welcome to the show.

215
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:55,923
>>: How's it going?>>: Appreciate you coming out.

216
00:07:56,027 --> 00:07:57,649
So, Devon,

217
00:07:57,753 --> 00:08:00,721
it seems like you had trouble,
sort of, being present

218
00:08:00,825 --> 00:08:02,689
as a dad, is that accurate?

219
00:08:03,862 --> 00:08:06,071
>>: Hmm, yeah, I guess
you could say that

220
00:08:06,175 --> 00:08:08,522
>>: Briana, what kind of dad
has Devon been?

221
00:08:08,626 --> 00:08:10,524
>>: Not the dad
he is supposed to be.

222
00:08:10,628 --> 00:08:12,492
>>: Devon, what do you
say to that?

223
00:08:13,251 --> 00:08:14,045
>>: I agree with that.

224
00:08:14,148 --> 00:08:15,253
[Drew] You wanna be a dad?

225
00:08:15,356 --> 00:08:17,255
Did you expect
to be a dad at your age?

226
00:08:17,358 --> 00:08:18,739
[Devon] No.>>: No.

227
00:08:18,843 --> 00:08:20,672
>>: Hmm-mmm.>>: How's it been for you?

228
00:08:20,776 --> 00:08:22,571
>>: You don't feel
like a kid anymore.

229
00:08:23,606 --> 00:08:26,436
>>: But you still do
kid things.

230
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,714
[Devon] What do you
mean by that?

231
00:08:27,817 --> 00:08:30,440
[Briana] You never put
Nova first, Devon.

232
00:08:30,544 --> 00:08:33,029
You work, what,
two days out of the whole week?

233
00:08:33,133 --> 00:08:36,412
So you work 24/7?
No, you don't work 24/7.

234
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:39,829
You could see Nova.
What do you do?

235
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:41,866
What honestly do you do all day?

236
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:44,558
That you can't come see Nova.

237
00:08:44,662 --> 00:08:46,664
>>: If I'm not working...
I live away in Poinciana,

238
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:48,838
they live, like, 45 minutes
away from there.

239
00:08:48,942 --> 00:08:51,013
>>: He is always
on my side of the area

240
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:53,394
but he can't come see Nova.>>: That's not true.

241
00:08:53,498 --> 00:08:54,741
>>: So when you hear
he is visiting your friends,

242
00:08:54,844 --> 00:08:56,432
and he doesn't come
see Nova you feel...

243
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,261
>>: It pisses me off.

244
00:08:58,365 --> 00:08:59,608
[Drew] Because?>>: Because that's his daughter.

245
00:08:59,711 --> 00:09:01,506
He is supposed
to be there for her.

246
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:02,749
>>: It feels like the feelings

247
00:09:02,852 --> 00:09:04,647
are little more complicated
than that.

248
00:09:05,268 --> 00:09:07,408
'Cause anger on the surface

249
00:09:07,512 --> 00:09:09,549
but there is, sort of,
pain underneath.

250
00:09:10,308 --> 00:09:11,620
Can you tell him
about that pain

251
00:09:11,723 --> 00:09:13,829
because I think all
he hears is about the anger.

252
00:09:13,932 --> 00:09:16,728
>>: I'm disappointed.[Drew] Can you tell him?

253
00:09:16,832 --> 00:09:19,006
>>: Very disappointed
at you.

254
00:09:21,422 --> 00:09:25,116
You fed me lies
during my whole pregnancy

255
00:09:25,219 --> 00:09:27,049
that you were
gonna be there, Devon.

256
00:09:29,707 --> 00:09:32,433
And I'm doing it on my own.

257
00:09:32,537 --> 00:09:35,575
You don't help financially,
you don't help emotionally

258
00:09:35,678 --> 00:09:37,300
and you don't help physically.

259
00:09:37,404 --> 00:09:40,131
Nothing whatsoever,
you don't help.

260
00:09:40,234 --> 00:09:42,858
I left him alone for now
with the baby,

261
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:44,825
he couldn't handle it.

262
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:46,655
He doesn't know
how to be a father.

263
00:09:46,758 --> 00:09:48,277
[Drew] Well, it's hard.
It's hard.

264
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,382
>>: Real hard.>>: But if he wants be a father,

265
00:09:50,486 --> 00:09:52,315
wouldn't you think
he would be there all the time

266
00:09:52,419 --> 00:09:54,076
to get to know
his daughter?

267
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:55,595
To bond
with his daughter?

268
00:09:55,698 --> 00:09:57,493
He doesn't. Why is that?

269
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,082
You keep making up excuses.

270
00:10:00,185 --> 00:10:02,429
>>: I don't make excuses at all.

271
00:10:02,532 --> 00:10:04,500
You know my situation.
You know where I live at.

272
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,571
>>: But you still always come

273
00:10:06,675 --> 00:10:07,745
to do your thing...>>: No, I don't always come.

274
00:10:07,848 --> 00:10:09,332
>>: ...on my side of the town.

275
00:10:09,436 --> 00:10:11,749
>>: I don't... How do you know
I'd be on your side of the town?

276
00:10:11,852 --> 00:10:13,751
>>: All your...>>: How do you even know?

277
00:10:13,854 --> 00:10:15,062
>>: ...with this person
and that person

278
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,546
and they live on my side.

279
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,789
>>: How do you know
they're in contact with me?

280
00:10:17,893 --> 00:10:19,377
>>: Not once have you
came to my house,

281
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:22,000
"Briana, here are some diapers
for the baby.

282
00:10:22,104 --> 00:10:24,624
Here is some formula,
here is this."

283
00:10:24,727 --> 00:10:27,661
You are worried about sneakers,
tattoos and phones.

284
00:10:28,904 --> 00:10:30,284
[Drew] Alright, let's move on.

285
00:10:30,491 --> 00:10:32,528
Devon, what kind of dad
you wanna be?

286
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:33,771
>>: Well... [scoffs]

287
00:10:35,704 --> 00:10:38,189
I'd want a close relationship
to my daughter, and I...

288
00:10:38,292 --> 00:10:39,880
I do want to know who I am.

289
00:10:39,984 --> 00:10:42,434
>>: This is the challenge
of being a teen dad.

290
00:10:42,538 --> 00:10:45,230
You need to grow up

291
00:10:45,334 --> 00:10:46,680
but your baby always needs you.

292
00:10:46,784 --> 00:10:49,959
So you, sort of, sacrifice
in the growing up piece

293
00:10:50,063 --> 00:10:51,064
to be a dad.

294
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,654
Is there a way that we can
get to that place

295
00:10:54,757 --> 00:10:56,069
where you're feeling better
about what you're doing

296
00:10:56,172 --> 00:10:58,002
and they are feeling
like supported?

297
00:10:58,105 --> 00:11:00,280
Is there, maybe, a structure?>>: I think... Right.

298
00:11:00,383 --> 00:11:02,006
It was just a bunch of pride.

299
00:11:02,109 --> 00:11:03,455
We have too much pride.>>: On your part?

300
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:05,630
I know I had a lot of pride.

301
00:11:05,734 --> 00:11:07,667
And I willing to put that
to the side.

302
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,565
>>: For the baby?>>: She is doing the same thing.

303
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,118
She does the same thing, like...

304
00:11:11,222 --> 00:11:13,742
I know at one point
she hated me, like,

305
00:11:13,845 --> 00:11:15,744
to the T.
She really hated me.

306
00:11:15,847 --> 00:11:18,022
But she would accept me
being there, like,

307
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,679
at her house.

308
00:11:19,782 --> 00:11:23,061
And I respected that, like,
I appreciated that.

309
00:11:23,165 --> 00:11:24,545
Little did she know.

310
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:26,202
I know she really, really
hated me

311
00:11:26,306 --> 00:11:28,170
but she would invite me over
to come see Nova.

312
00:11:28,273 --> 00:11:30,241
>>: He is right, isn't he?[Briana] Mmm-hmm.

313
00:11:30,344 --> 00:11:32,450
>>: Okay. And he is willing
to say that

314
00:11:32,553 --> 00:11:34,797
and willing
to continue to try

315
00:11:34,901 --> 00:11:37,731
to craft a relationship with you
and your family for the baby.

316
00:11:37,835 --> 00:11:39,802
>>: But the thing is,
with me it's like,

317
00:11:39,906 --> 00:11:42,771
he has my hopes up and then
he always disappoints me

318
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,946
And that's not fair.

319
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:49,950
Don't say you are gonna do it,
you wanna do it.

320
00:11:50,054 --> 00:11:51,227
Do it.

321
00:11:51,331 --> 00:11:53,367
>>: It's hard to just come
into the baby's life.

322
00:11:53,471 --> 00:11:55,956
And like she said she let me
watch the baby for an hour,

323
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,751
and I hadn't know how to like...

324
00:11:57,855 --> 00:11:59,408
I barely knew anything
about the baby, like...

325
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,893
>>: Yeah, so I'm giving you guys
some assignments.

326
00:12:01,997 --> 00:12:03,239
[Devon] Yeah, I didn't...>>: Here is the assignment.

327
00:12:03,343 --> 00:12:04,931
[Brian chuckles]>>: Here's your assignment.

328
00:12:05,034 --> 00:12:06,933
You need to spend all day
with the baby at some point.

329
00:12:07,036 --> 00:12:08,589
You need to let him do that.

330
00:12:08,693 --> 00:12:11,696
And you need to have
a shared experience,

331
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,353
the three of you together
doing something.

332
00:12:13,456 --> 00:12:14,630
Zoo, what comes to mind,

333
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,045
something like that.[Briana] Okay.

334
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:17,115
>>: And you guys have got to be
willing to do that.

335
00:12:17,219 --> 00:12:18,254
Let that happen.

336
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:21,085
Briana and Devon, thank you.
it's tough. It is tough.

337
00:12:21,188 --> 00:12:22,396
Briana is gonna be back later

338
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,433
along with other 11 teenage moms

339
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:26,711
right here together on the stage
for the first time.

340
00:12:26,815 --> 00:12:28,920
Now, in a moment
we're gonna return with Lindsey.

341
00:12:29,024 --> 00:12:31,336
She and her
baby's father Forest,

342
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,476
I think you saw, did a lot
of fighting this season.

343
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,341
But when the dust cleared,

to use it again.

We didn't use it one time
and I thought--

[Drew] You didn't get pregnant

413
00:15:21,334 --> 00:15:22,749
therefore you never
use it again?

00:15:22,852 --> 00:15:25,269
>>: Yeah, we thought that
we couldn't make babies.

or he couldn't

417
00:15:28,789 --> 00:15:29,963
It was dumb, we should have.

for birth control now?

00:15:31,654 --> 00:15:33,760
>>: Um, well, actually right now
we are using condoms.

420
00:15:33,863 --> 00:15:37,246
And then I went to go get, like,
the IUD with my insurance,

421
00:15:37,350 --> 00:15:39,283
since they cover it,
so it's like, 1,000 bucks,.

422
00:15:39,386 --> 00:15:41,802
So I found a different place
that I could go to,

423
00:15:41,906 --> 00:15:43,080
and it's a free clinic

424
00:15:43,183 --> 00:15:44,460
and they are gonna
give me birth control

425
00:15:44,564 --> 00:15:45,703
but it takes, like,

426
00:15:45,806 --> 00:15:47,429
they said a month to get me in,

427
00:15:47,774 --> 00:15:48,913
so I'm still waiting.

428
00:15:49,017 --> 00:15:51,295
>>: Yeah, but it's
Catholic insurance,

429
00:15:51,398 --> 00:15:52,710
so they won't
cover birth control.

430
00:15:52,813 --> 00:15:54,056
>>: Yeah.>>: At all.

431
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,920

about it.

postnatal care?

437
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:07,138
>>: Yeah, they paid $12,000
for me to have a baby

438
00:16:07,242 --> 00:16:11,315
but not a hundred bucks
to cover the birth control.

to a Li,

440
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:14,663
let's say
she is 17-years-old now.

>>: I'd get her on birth control
as soon as she start to period.

No ifs and buts about that.

446
00:16:24,638 --> 00:16:27,296
And then just always be
open with her.

447
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,264

to waste your childhood.

00:16:31,266 --> 00:16:32,405

with you then?

[Forest] Well, because she had
a bunch of complications.

474
00:17:13,342 --> 00:17:14,654
She was always in the hospital,

475
00:17:14,757 --> 00:17:16,345

fought one time,

for all sexually active teens.

Having unprotected s#*x regularly

00:18:08,984 --> 00:18:12,539

of pregnancy within one year.

The question now is,
her baby's father, Josh,

503
00:18:18,511 --> 00:18:19,926
has he given up bull riding?

504
00:18:20,029 --> 00:18:22,687
Or has the adrenal rush got
too much of a grip on him?

is a competitive cheerleader
named Mackenzie.

514

Let's take a look back

515
00:18:52,372 --> 00:18:54,823
at her time
being 16 and pregnant.

00:19:00,898 --> 00:19:02,727
[woman] College days?>>: Yeah, you had a six-pack.

For you to take
on a responsibility like this,

00:19:12,185 --> 00:19:13,393
it worries me.

525
00:19:13,497 --> 00:19:15,844
>>: We need to both settle down
and get jobs.

526
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:19,158
It takes time. I can't just
go out there and apply for a job

527
00:19:19,261 --> 00:19:20,607
and expect for...

528
00:19:20,711 --> 00:19:21,884

we're gonna come close

You can't work.

You can at least say,
"It will all work out."

00:19:34,656 --> 00:19:36,761
>>: No, you just don't get it.
You don't.

gonna be alright. But it's not.

to be better than this.

is to stay with me...

about him riding broncos

hoping he won't get hurt again.

Don't you worry

[Josh] Yeah, I'm gonna
be there for him.

I don't wanna rodeo and get in
the way of everything,

the heavy stuff again?

doing before.

your educational plans?

578
00:21:03,572 --> 00:21:05,091
Since I was,

579
00:21:05,194 --> 00:21:07,231
uh, in first grade,
I had this dream

580
00:21:07,335 --> 00:21:09,785
to go to this college
called Oasis.

581
00:21:09,889 --> 00:21:12,512
They have one of the best
cheer squads.

582
00:21:12,616 --> 00:21:13,582
Now I can't...
I don't even think

583
00:21:13,686 --> 00:21:15,619
I can go to college and cheer.

584
00:21:15,722 --> 00:21:16,689
So...

585
00:21:17,137 --> 00:21:18,415
>>: So, that's a tough thing
to swallow.

586
00:21:18,518 --> 00:21:20,002
>>: Yeah. And I would like
to go to college,

587
00:21:20,106 --> 00:21:21,694
but I think about it every day

588
00:21:21,797 --> 00:21:23,799
and I don't think
there is a way I can.

589
00:21:23,903 --> 00:21:24,904
>>: Were you using
birth control?

590
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,871
[Mackenzie] [softly] No.>>: No!

591
00:21:27,493 --> 00:21:28,390
And how come?

592
00:21:29,115 --> 00:21:31,669
>>: Um...
I didn't wanna gain weight!

593
00:21:31,773 --> 00:21:33,671
[laughs]

594
00:21:33,775 --> 00:21:35,570
But then I got pregnant
and gained

595
00:21:35,673 --> 00:21:37,813
a lot of weight!>>: Yeah!

596
00:21:37,917 --> 00:21:39,884
You were diabetic
during your pregnancy, right?

597
00:21:39,988 --> 00:21:41,817
>>: Oh, yeah. I'm type 1.
I've been diabetic--

598
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:43,198
>>: Oh... also diabetic.>>: Yes!

599
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,682
>>: Oh, okay. Okay.>>: Yeah.

600
00:21:44,993 --> 00:21:47,754
So, it just makes your pregnancy
more complicated.

601
00:21:47,858 --> 00:21:48,790
>>: Oh, my gosh. Yeah.

602
00:21:48,893 --> 00:21:49,860
>>: Yeah.>>: I had a...

603
00:21:49,963 --> 00:21:52,138

604
00:21:52,241 --> 00:21:54,002
and almost 10 pounds. [chuckles]

605
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:55,624
>>: A lot of people don't know

606
00:21:55,728 --> 00:21:57,350
for juveniles that are diabetic,
the babies are actually bigger.

607
00:21:57,454 --> 00:21:58,593
They have big babies.>>: Oh, yeah.

608
00:21:58,696 --> 00:21:59,697
>>: Yeah.>>: Yeah.

609
00:21:59,801 --> 00:22:00,698
>>: You had
a ten pound baby,

610
00:22:00,802 --> 00:22:01,630
and you are
not a big girl.

611
00:22:01,734 --> 00:22:03,080
>>: No!>>: Wow!

612
00:22:03,183 --> 00:22:04,530
>>: Are you using
birth control now?

613
00:22:07,256 --> 00:22:09,155
[Josh chuckles softly]So you wanna have another baby?

614
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,399
>>: No. No. [laughs]

615
00:22:11,502 --> 00:22:13,366
>>; Help me understand
how that's not gonna happen.

616
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:14,505
>>: I don't know!

617
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:17,059
I don't like
birth control.

618
00:22:17,163 --> 00:22:19,441
I don't like
getting pregnant neither. But...

619
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,374
Um...

620
00:22:21,478 --> 00:22:22,513
>>: Condoms are not scary!
What about that?

621
00:22:22,617 --> 00:22:23,480
Condoms.[Josh groans]

622
00:22:23,894 --> 00:22:25,792
>>: Josh?>>: He is allergic to latex.

623
00:22:25,896 --> 00:22:27,207
>>: I think that's why
I got pregnant.

624
00:22:27,311 --> 00:22:28,554
[Drew] Polyurethane condoms,
animal skin condoms.

625
00:22:28,657 --> 00:22:30,659
There are plenty of options
other than latex.

626
00:22:31,246 --> 00:22:32,730
For people out there
that may have latex allergies

627
00:22:32,834 --> 00:22:34,007
which are rather common,

628
00:22:34,111 --> 00:22:35,975
polyurethane, so called
animal skin condom.

629
00:22:36,078 --> 00:22:38,184
Two different kinds of options
other than latex.

630
00:22:39,219 --> 00:22:40,531
By the way, Josh,
I'm just saying.

631
00:22:40,635 --> 00:22:41,808
>>: Yeah.

632
00:22:41,912 --> 00:22:42,637
>>: What do you guys
are doing for work now?

633
00:22:43,638 --> 00:22:44,984
>>: He is waiting
to get a job.

634
00:22:45,087 --> 00:22:47,435
And I've applied
at 16 places.

635
00:22:47,538 --> 00:22:50,369
And I've been looking
for a job for six months.

636
00:22:50,472 --> 00:22:52,301
>>: So, how are you
supporting yourselves?

637
00:22:54,131 --> 00:22:56,167
>>: Our parents. [laughs]

638
00:22:56,271 --> 00:22:57,168

parents are...

639
00:22:57,272 --> 00:22:58,238
>>: Yeah.>>: Yeah.

640
00:22:58,342 --> 00:22:59,412
>>: Are you living
with them?

641
00:23:00,068 --> 00:23:01,241
>>: We don't live together.

642
00:23:01,345 --> 00:23:02,726
We both live
with our parents.

643
00:23:02,829 --> 00:23:05,487
>>: Oh!>>: We have no money.

644
00:23:05,867 --> 00:23:07,800
I had to ask my mom
to buy some...

645
00:23:07,903 --> 00:23:09,836
Little stuff like
Titan tablets.

646
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,529
I can't even do that. But...>>: Hmm.

647
00:23:12,632 --> 00:23:14,013
>>: How is your relationship
with your mom?

648
00:23:14,738 --> 00:23:16,360
>>: She is my best friend.>>: Your best friend.

649
00:23:16,464 --> 00:23:18,189
Does she know
you're having unprotected s#*x?

650
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:20,675
>>: Um...

651
00:23:20,778 --> 00:23:22,331
We haven't had an whoopsie,

652
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:23,816
since the baby
is been born.

653
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:25,024
But I don't know

654
00:23:25,127 --> 00:23:26,577
how much longer
that's gonna last.

655
00:23:27,544 --> 00:23:29,615
I mean, me and my mom
have talked about it.

656
00:23:29,718 --> 00:23:31,099
And she would like for me

657
00:23:31,202 --> 00:23:33,412
to be on birth control in case,

658
00:23:33,515 --> 00:23:35,897
but she thinks
it gives us a reason

659
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,140
to just have s#*x all the time.

660
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:41,903
Let's bring out mom and talk
about this. How about we?

661
00:23:42,006 --> 00:23:43,491
Angie, come on out here.

662
00:23:45,182 --> 00:23:46,355
How are you?[applauding]

663
00:23:46,459 --> 00:23:47,874
[Angie] Hello. Hi.>>: Nice to meet you.

664
00:23:48,496 --> 00:23:50,877
So, it seems like
they are, uh...

665
00:23:50,981 --> 00:23:53,293
Kind of a Russian roulette
going on between these two.

666
00:23:53,397 --> 00:23:55,848
Mom, what are we gonna do about
birth control for these guys?

667
00:23:55,951 --> 00:23:57,608
[Angie] Um...

668
00:23:57,712 --> 00:24:00,680
I... I do not agree

669
00:24:00,784 --> 00:24:02,441
with anyone having s#*x
that's not married.

670
00:24:02,544 --> 00:24:04,926
I'm sorry.
I know that I'm not normal.

671
00:24:05,029 --> 00:24:06,134
[Drew] That's fine.
No, that's fine.

672
00:24:06,237 --> 00:24:07,411
>>: But that's way I feel.

673
00:24:07,515 --> 00:24:08,895
And I have that right
to feel that way.

674
00:24:09,482 --> 00:24:11,104
There are just
too many risks.

675
00:24:11,208 --> 00:24:13,141
It causes too many
emotional problems.

676
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:14,729
And it's not
the right thing to do.

677
00:24:14,832 --> 00:24:18,664
And you have to be careful also
with birth control and diabetes.

678
00:24:18,767 --> 00:24:20,182
So, it would have to be,

679
00:24:20,286 --> 00:24:22,115
um, something highly suggested

680
00:24:22,219 --> 00:24:24,290
by an endocrinologist.

681
00:24:24,393 --> 00:24:25,602
>>: A condom would be
a simple solution.

682
00:24:25,705 --> 00:24:27,362
If we're really gonna...
And that simple enough.

683
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,088
>>: A copper-->>: Won't be simple--

684
00:24:29,191 --> 00:24:31,297
>>: Copper IUD is other one.>>: Right.

685
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,574
>>: You know,
we don't wanna think

686
00:24:32,678 --> 00:24:34,093
about out kids having s#*x,
but they do.

687
00:24:34,196 --> 00:24:35,750
And especially with,
somebody as diabetic,

688
00:24:35,853 --> 00:24:37,890
you gotta be really
super thoughtful

689
00:24:37,993 --> 00:24:39,374
and...[Angie] It's...

690
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:41,376
>>: Yeah. And I don't think

691
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,136
people fully understand.

692
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:44,413
If she doesn't take care
of herself

693
00:24:44,517 --> 00:24:46,415
or if she got pregnant again,

694
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:49,280
she may not be the one who gets
to watch Gannon grow up.

695
00:24:49,384 --> 00:24:50,868
[Drew] I know.>>: It's that serious.

696
00:24:50,972 --> 00:24:51,904
>>: She doesn't see that.

697
00:24:52,007 --> 00:24:53,284
We need some sort of commitment,

698
00:24:53,388 --> 00:24:54,562
I guess, from both of you

699
00:24:54,665 --> 00:24:56,425
that she is gonna go see
an endocrinologist

700
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:58,462
and get appropriate
birth control.

701
00:24:59,187 --> 00:25:00,602
No? Mom.[chuckles]

702
00:25:00,706 --> 00:25:02,742
One that meets
everybody's criteria.

703
00:25:02,846 --> 00:25:04,433
>>: Yeah.>>: No?

704
00:25:04,537 --> 00:25:06,228
>>: Yes, I want her
to be healthy

705
00:25:06,332 --> 00:25:07,678
but I also wanna her to make
better choices.

706
00:25:07,782 --> 00:25:10,129
>>: I'm just so fearful that
if there is an whoopsie,

707
00:25:10,232 --> 00:25:11,648
as she calls it, that her life

708
00:25:11,751 --> 00:25:13,442
hangs in the balance...>>: I completely agree.

709
00:25:13,546 --> 00:25:14,996
>>: That's to support the body.>>: I do.

710
00:25:15,099 --> 00:25:17,343
>>: So at least commit you'll
talk to endocrinologist...

711
00:25:17,446 --> 00:25:18,482
>>: Yes.>>: ...about this.

712
00:25:18,586 --> 00:25:20,001
>>: Okay.>>: I'm a realist too.

713
00:25:20,104 --> 00:25:21,934
>>: This one takes away
my breath away a little bit.

714
00:25:22,555 --> 00:25:24,350
This is a lot at risk here.

715
00:25:24,453 --> 00:25:26,007
And, medically,
very very complicated.

716
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:27,802
Both of them. Very complicated.[Angie] Very complicated.

717
00:25:27,905 --> 00:25:30,459
This is not something
most people have to deal with.

718
00:25:31,219 --> 00:25:32,427
I mean, between
your head injury,

719
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:33,773
your neck injury,
your medication,

720
00:25:33,877 --> 00:25:35,982
your diabetes,
your gestational issues,

721
00:25:36,086 --> 00:25:37,363
your birth control issues,

722
00:25:37,466 --> 00:25:40,849
your appropriate
kinds of values and concerns.

723
00:25:40,953 --> 00:25:42,713
That makes this
very complicated.

724
00:25:42,817 --> 00:25:43,887
Again,

725
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:45,647
I end up saying
almost every time

726
00:25:45,751 --> 00:25:48,477
a new couple comes out here.
And it's...

727
00:25:48,581 --> 00:25:50,825
Spirals out of control
because of a teen pregnancy.

728
00:25:50,928 --> 00:25:52,723
That makes it just
so much more complicated.

729
00:25:52,827 --> 00:25:53,759
>>: It does.

730
00:25:53,862 --> 00:25:55,312
>>: Okay, and a reminder
to our viewers.

731
00:25:55,415 --> 00:25:56,451
You need to understand
the importance

732
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,659
of pregnancy prevention.

733
00:25:57,763 --> 00:25:59,143
This has been
a very cautionary tale

734
00:25:59,247 --> 00:26:00,420
of how complicated it gets.

735
00:26:00,524 --> 00:26:01,560
So, to educate yourself

736
00:26:01,663 --> 00:26:04,735
log on to
16andpregnant.mtv.com

737
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:06,426
And when you're there,
just give this some thought,

738
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:07,876
think about what your life
would really be like

739
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:10,223
if you got pregnant
or if you got someone pregnant.

740
00:26:10,327 --> 00:26:12,260
Also, discuss this
with your partner.

741
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:13,779
I'd say,
with your parents.

742
00:26:13,882 --> 00:26:15,712
If your partner is cool enough
to have s#*x with you,

743
00:26:15,815 --> 00:26:17,955
they are certainly cool enough
to talk about prevention.

744
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:20,233
Thanks to Mackenzie,
Josh and Angie.

745
00:26:20,337 --> 00:26:22,442
We're gonna have more with
Mackenzie at the end of show

746
00:26:22,546 --> 00:26:24,617
when she and the 11 other girls

747
00:26:24,721 --> 00:26:26,515
come together for
the very first time right here.

748
00:26:26,619 --> 00:26:28,276
But for now,
it's time to take a break.

749
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:29,415
We return with Sarah.

750
00:26:29,518 --> 00:26:30,968
We saw Blake leave her

751
00:26:31,072 --> 00:26:33,626
for life on a shrimp boat.
That's right.

752
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:34,938
Did he leave for good

753
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:37,216
or is he back
in his daughter Tinleigh's life?

754
00:26:37,319 --> 00:26:39,080
That and more
when we return.

Welcome back to
Life After Labor. I'm Dr. Drew.

758
00:26:54,474 --> 00:26:56,028
Now, incredibly, get this,

759
00:26:56,131 --> 00:26:59,203
there are nearly
750,000 teen pregnancies

760
00:26:59,307 --> 00:27:01,309
every year in this country.

761
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:02,690
Sarah is one of those teens.

762
00:27:02,793 --> 00:27:04,346
And we are gonna talk to her
and her mom Tina.

763
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,003
And her baby's father Blake.

764
00:27:06,107 --> 00:27:07,764
They have not all been together
in quite some time.

765
00:27:07,867 --> 00:27:10,283
After this recap of her story.
Take a look.

>>: I guess,
sometimes I wish that

768
00:27:17,774 --> 00:27:19,638
we'd a little bit longer

769
00:27:19,741 --> 00:27:21,432
before I got pregnant.

770
00:27:21,536 --> 00:27:24,228
>>: Hopefully,
he will be supportive.

I just don't like the way
that he treats you sometimes.

772
00:27:26,921 --> 00:27:28,474
Between Blake and mom,

773
00:27:28,577 --> 00:27:29,717
they still aren't talking.

774

that Blake will leave

775
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:33,375
because of the stuff
with him and your mom?

776

like, without him.

you'd call me a b#*##*h.

like that.

I never do!

She ain't in this relationship.

783
00:27:45,353 --> 00:27:46,768
Why does she have
to start in on me?

784
00:27:46,872 --> 00:27:48,908
Well, that's why I don't like
staying here.

785
00:27:49,012 --> 00:27:50,220
It's 'cause I'm not welcome.

>>: He better start
taking responsibility

787
00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:53,948
because I'm not gonna tolerate
this behavior.

just pay child support

789

I never ever wanna do this.
Something... [mumbling]

>>: It's terrible
that you don't wanna try.

794

To give [bleep]
about her family.

795

You [bleep] use us.

>>: How do you feel,
now that he has left?

798
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:16,453

to talk about how I feel

799
00:28:16,556 --> 00:28:17,454

800
00:28:17,557 --> 00:28:18,869

801
00:28:18,973 --> 00:28:21,354
>>: I understand that.
I realize he is not here.

have waited to have a baby.

>>: Yeah.>>: What are you crying about?

805
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:37,439
>>: Just watching about,
like, talking after he left

806
00:28:37,543 --> 00:28:38,924
is so hard.

807
00:28:39,752 --> 00:28:41,029
Because it's all still...

00:28:41,133 --> 00:28:43,169
Like, it still hurts.>>: Still fresh.

809
00:28:43,894 --> 00:28:45,413
And where is he now?

00:28:46,034 --> 00:28:47,656
>>: He lives
in South Georgia now.

811
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,830
So...

812
00:28:49,141 --> 00:28:50,832
>>: Does he see Tinleigh at all?>>: No.

813
00:28:51,557 --> 00:28:53,421
>>: So, it hurts
not just for you, but her too.

814
00:28:53,524 --> 00:28:55,837
>>: I think it hurts
more for her than for me.

815
00:28:56,217 --> 00:28:57,459
And, Tina, you have
to suffer through this

816
00:28:57,563 --> 00:29:00,255
both for Tinleigh and Sarah.[Tina] Yeah.

817
00:29:00,704 --> 00:29:01,878
You know,
we let him come

818
00:29:01,981 --> 00:29:04,294
and stay at our home

819
00:29:04,397 --> 00:29:06,158
and he just didn't
appreciate anything.

820
00:29:06,261 --> 00:29:09,161
>>: So, you are feeling their
abandonment as much as they are.

>>: Yeah.

00:29:10,403 --> 00:29:13,199
I mean, I'm not sad
that he is gone now.

823
00:29:13,303 --> 00:29:14,718

without him.

>>: Well, let me play
Devil advocate!

825
00:29:16,064 --> 00:29:17,169
He said
he was sending you money.

826
00:29:17,272 --> 00:29:18,722
He went to make
more money for you guys.

827
00:29:18,826 --> 00:29:21,104
He went to be a shrimp--[Sarah] He didn't send anything.

828
00:29:21,932 --> 00:29:23,900
He sent me, maybe, $200.

829
00:29:24,003 --> 00:29:26,454
And $200
isn't gonna buy you...

[Tina] Is nothing.>>:...a month worth of diapers.

Sarah, of all this?

833
00:29:33,357 --> 00:29:35,187
>>: Probably doing it alone.

834
00:29:35,912 --> 00:29:37,258
>>: Mmm. You have your mom,
thank god.

835
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:39,639
>>: Yes. Yeah. I mean,
I'm so thankful for family.

836
00:29:39,743 --> 00:29:42,263
If I didn't have
my family, I...

837
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,023
[Drew] Where would you be?

838
00:29:44,713 --> 00:29:46,094
>>: Not in school.

in your education right now.

840

And I will graduate in June.

842
00:29:51,651 --> 00:29:54,447
So, I'm excited.[Tina] Grades are good.

843
00:29:54,551 --> 00:29:57,002
>>: Yeah, my grades are good.>>: Grades are good.

844
00:29:57,105 --> 00:29:59,867
Towards the end of your episode,
you talked about

845
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:01,213
how you regretted
motherhood.

846
00:30:01,316 --> 00:30:02,973
>>: Yeah, I remember it.>>: Tell me about that.

847
00:30:03,077 --> 00:30:04,872
>>: Well, before
I got pregnant

848
00:30:04,975 --> 00:30:06,390
I never wanted kids.

849
00:30:06,494 --> 00:30:09,635
I didn't... Like, it wasn't
something that was, like,

850
00:30:09,738 --> 00:30:11,430
"Oh, one day I'm gonna
get married and have kids."

851
00:30:11,533 --> 00:30:13,328
That was never
in the plan for me.

852
00:30:13,432 --> 00:30:15,158
I wanted to go
to college.

853
00:30:15,261 --> 00:30:16,193
I wanted to move
to New York.

854
00:30:16,297 --> 00:30:18,023
And I wanted
to be an editor

855

of a magazine.

856
00:30:19,265 --> 00:30:21,612
And, now it's like...

857
00:30:22,751 --> 00:30:25,375
I have to change everything
I wanna do.

858
00:30:25,478 --> 00:30:27,239
Of course, like,
after you have a baby

859
00:30:27,342 --> 00:30:29,379
postpartum depressions
is like a big thing.

860
00:30:29,482 --> 00:30:31,346
>>: Did you have that?>>: Yes. Really bad. Really bad.

861
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,761
Especially after Blake left.

862
00:30:32,865 --> 00:30:35,212
>>: Let's see what Blake
has to say about all this.

863
00:30:35,316 --> 00:30:36,558
Let's bring him out.

864
00:30:36,662 --> 00:30:37,732
You guys have not seen him
in several months.

865
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:39,251
Blake, come on out here.

866
00:30:39,907 --> 00:30:40,631
Come on, Blake.

867
00:30:40,735 --> 00:30:43,358
[applauding]

868
00:30:43,462 --> 00:30:44,704
>>: Hey, Blake.>>: How are we doing?

869
00:30:44,808 --> 00:30:45,774
>>: Have a seat.

870
00:30:46,534 --> 00:30:48,639
So, you heard
what they are saying.

871
00:30:48,743 --> 00:30:50,400
>>: Yeah.>>: You only sent 200 bucks

872
00:30:50,503 --> 00:30:52,851
up from your
shrimp boating expedition

873
00:30:52,954 --> 00:30:54,024
that was supposed to generate

874
00:30:54,128 --> 00:30:55,474
so much resources
for your family.

875
00:30:55,577 --> 00:30:57,200
>>: Right!>>: Let's start with that.

876
00:30:57,303 --> 00:30:58,511
How come no money
for the kid?

877
00:30:58,615 --> 00:30:59,547
>>: Oh, well,

878
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,929
first, I sent
a little more than that.

879
00:31:02,032 --> 00:31:04,932
I sent, I think $300-$400.

880
00:31:05,035 --> 00:31:06,347
And they are saying $200.

881
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:09,005
>>: Needless to say,
even if it was 400,

882
00:31:09,108 --> 00:31:10,420
that doesn't support a baby.

883
00:31:10,523 --> 00:31:12,077
Blake, is there anything
you wanna tell Sarah?

884
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:13,078
>>: Do you wanna-->>: Yeah.

885
00:31:13,181 --> 00:31:14,734
Well, you know...

886
00:31:14,838 --> 00:31:15,943
Sorry, like...

887
00:31:16,046 --> 00:31:17,806
I do have goals.
You know, I'm, uh,

888
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,223
Me and my cousin, we're gonna
buy a boat this year.

889
00:31:20,326 --> 00:31:22,052
You know,
I've got my own house.

890
00:31:22,156 --> 00:31:23,329
You know, I've got ambition.

891
00:31:23,433 --> 00:31:24,503
>>: What kind of father
do you wanna be?

892
00:31:24,606 --> 00:31:26,470
I will be there
for our daughter.

893
00:31:26,574 --> 00:31:27,920
[Drew] Were your parents
there for you?

894
00:31:28,024 --> 00:31:29,094
[Blake] Yeah,
a little bit, but...

895
00:31:29,197 --> 00:31:30,474
You know, like...

896
00:31:30,578 --> 00:31:32,166
Yeah, I don't know my dad.
I don't know him.

897
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:33,374
>>: You don't know your dad?

898
00:31:33,477 --> 00:31:34,823
>>: No! I ain't got a clue
who he is.

899
00:31:34,927 --> 00:31:35,928
>>: Do you want your daughter
to go through that?

900
00:31:36,032 --> 00:31:37,274
>>: No, I don't.

901
00:31:37,378 --> 00:31:38,586
[Drew] Haven't you, sort of,
set that all up.

902
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:40,001
She did... That's what
she wanted to avoid.

903
00:31:40,105 --> 00:31:41,451
Well, both of you,

904
00:31:41,554 --> 00:31:43,280
you guys are both recreating
your both childhoods.

905
00:31:43,384 --> 00:31:44,454
>>: Both of you![Blake] Right.

906
00:31:44,557 --> 00:31:45,731
>>: He says he wants
to be there

907
00:31:45,834 --> 00:31:47,940
but he doesn't do
anything to be there.

908
00:31:50,218 --> 00:31:51,254
Like...

909
00:31:51,771 --> 00:31:53,083
"Because I gonna wanna move
back up there.

910
00:31:53,187 --> 00:31:54,464
There is nothing
for me up there."

911
00:31:54,567 --> 00:31:56,984
But if you love your child,
you would do that.

912
00:31:57,087 --> 00:31:58,226
>>: Where would I work?

913
00:31:58,778 --> 00:32:00,470
What would I do?[Tina] You had a job...

914
00:32:00,573 --> 00:32:02,437
>>: Who cares if he makes
7.25 an hour.

915
00:32:02,541 --> 00:32:04,612
If you with your child,
that's what matters.

916
00:32:04,715 --> 00:32:06,303
>>: That's why you finish school
and go to college.

917
00:32:06,407 --> 00:32:07,753
>>: If you love your...>>: No, that's not

918
00:32:07,856 --> 00:32:08,961
what I might be doing>>: If you love your child.

919
00:32:09,065 --> 00:32:10,342
>>: Okay, it isn't...

920
00:32:10,445 --> 00:32:12,378
You screwed yourself
out of being happy

921
00:32:12,482 --> 00:32:14,001
when you got me pregnant.

922
00:32:14,104 --> 00:32:15,554
You don't get to choose

923
00:32:15,657 --> 00:32:18,039
this is the job I wanna do
for the rest of my life.

924
00:32:18,143 --> 00:32:19,592
Being eight hours
away from my child

925
00:32:19,696 --> 00:32:21,042
and then say
you wanna be in her life.

926
00:32:21,146 --> 00:32:22,768
It doesn't work that way, Blake.

927
00:32:22,871 --> 00:32:24,735
If you love Tinleigh,

928
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:26,496
you give up
doing what you love.

929
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:28,429
Because I'm giving up
doing what I wanna do,

930
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:29,913
something that
I would have loved

931
00:32:30,017 --> 00:32:31,121
because I love Tinleigh.

932
00:32:31,225 --> 00:32:33,675
And I'm not gonna
put my self first.

933
00:32:35,056 --> 00:32:36,230
>>: You got nothing to say?

934
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:38,577
[Blake] Mmm. I wish
I can take it all back.

935
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,682
I'd take back even leaving.

936
00:32:40,786 --> 00:32:41,856
>>: You would've stayed
with Tinleigh?

937
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,547
>>: I would stay
with Tinleigh and Sarah.

938
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:45,687
I really would.

939
00:32:45,791 --> 00:32:48,621
I'd do anything now,
getting 'em back in my life.

940
00:32:48,725 --> 00:32:49,864
Really.

941
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,521
You know, I'd move back.

942
00:32:51,624 --> 00:32:53,074
If I had a place to go.

943
00:32:57,320 --> 00:32:58,700

too many times.

We are gonna step aside
for a break.

951
00:33:10,126 --> 00:33:12,921
And then return with Kristina.
Her baby's father, Todd, died

952
00:33:13,025 --> 00:33:15,510
when she was
three months pregnant.

953
00:33:15,614 --> 00:33:17,236
Now the question is,
how is she doing today?

954
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:19,687
And what's become of the
relationship with Todd's family?

955
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,792

and just taking off
for the water.

Then I realized
Todd wasn't with 'em.

My probation officer
didn't me go down there.

1198
00:42:07,835 --> 00:42:09,216
>>: Are you sober now, Matt?

1199
00:42:09,837 --> 00:42:11,598
[Matt] Yes.
I'm doing Alright.

1200
00:42:11,701 --> 00:42:13,082
N.A. AA. meetings...

1201
00:42:13,185 --> 00:42:15,118
>>: Yeah, you have commitment
today in the meetings?

1202
00:42:15,912 --> 00:42:17,535
[Matt] Oh, yeah,
I've been trying to go.

1203
00:42:17,638 --> 00:42:20,261
I'm trying to go
at least two times a week.

1204
00:42:20,365 --> 00:42:22,678
>>: Two times a week?
Matt, dude!

1205
00:42:22,781 --> 00:42:24,887
I looked... I watched
your episode

1206
00:42:24,990 --> 00:42:26,958
and I can see
how bad your drug problem is.

1207
00:42:27,061 --> 00:42:29,063
You need to be going
two times a day.

1208
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:30,409
Um...

1209
00:42:30,513 --> 00:42:32,308
Matt, you said
some rather profound things

1210
00:42:32,411 --> 00:42:33,620
during your episode

1211
00:42:33,723 --> 00:42:35,863
about being a teenager
and being a parent.

1212
00:42:35,967 --> 00:42:37,520
You wanna give us
some of your thoughts

1213
00:42:37,624 --> 00:42:38,659
about that right now?

1214
00:42:39,039 --> 00:42:41,075
[Matt] I remember going
[clears throat]

1215
00:42:41,179 --> 00:42:42,801
to the adoption agency.

1216
00:42:42,905 --> 00:42:46,046
And they had, like,
a little list of criterias.

1217
00:42:46,149 --> 00:42:49,118
What, um, parents should
be able to provide and...

1218
00:42:49,221 --> 00:42:52,259
I looked it out,
saw into myself and...

1219
00:42:52,742 --> 00:42:55,089
I couldn't really see
either one of us

1220
00:42:55,193 --> 00:42:58,783
being able to do those things,
meet those requirements.

1221
00:42:58,886 --> 00:43:01,268
And when I sit back and think

1222
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:03,166
to even back then where I was,

1223
00:43:03,270 --> 00:43:04,927
I'm still in no way

1224
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:06,273
to ready to raise a child--

1225
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:08,171
>>: Matt, let me
just interrupt you and say,

1226
00:43:08,275 --> 00:43:11,002
the reality is,
I think most teen parents

1227
00:43:11,105 --> 00:43:13,004
would not meet those criteria
you mentioned

1228
00:43:13,107 --> 00:43:15,316
and yet everyone
is still a teen parent.

1229
00:43:15,834 --> 00:43:17,802
And that's the reality
of what's happening here.

1230
00:43:17,905 --> 00:43:20,598
But nothing right now,
for her,

1231
00:43:20,701 --> 00:43:22,876
is more important
than your recovery.

1232
00:43:22,979 --> 00:43:25,016
So, my friend,
I wish you the best.

1233
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:27,018
And we'll say prayers for you.

1234
00:43:27,121 --> 00:43:28,985
Stay focused
and I'll try to talk to Alex

1235
00:43:29,089 --> 00:43:30,987
about your condition
a little bit, okay?

1236
00:43:31,091 --> 00:43:33,196
[Matt] Alright, thank you.>>: Alright. Good luck, Matt.

1237
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,613
[Matt] Alright, thank you.>>: Alright, so...

1238
00:43:35,716 --> 00:43:38,132
Matt has an illness.
That's the reality.

1239
00:43:38,236 --> 00:43:39,340
And as a result,

1240
00:43:39,444 --> 00:43:42,136
just like any other disease,
it handicaps him

1241
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,483
while he's in treatment,
while his disease is active.

1242
00:43:44,587 --> 00:43:46,624
And things like work
and parenting

1243
00:43:46,727 --> 00:43:48,591
are deeply affected by it.

1244
00:43:49,109 --> 00:43:51,076
>>: But he constantly
is asking me,

1245
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:53,354
"I wanna see my child.
Can I see my child?

1246
00:43:53,458 --> 00:43:54,493
Can I watch my child?"

1247
00:43:54,597 --> 00:43:56,047
Sure, you can watch
your child.

1248
00:43:56,150 --> 00:43:58,256
And what I find out is,
he drops him... drops her off

1249
00:43:58,359 --> 00:43:59,533
with his mom and goes out.

1250
00:43:59,637 --> 00:44:02,329
And he's going behind my back
with other girls.

1251
00:44:02,432 --> 00:44:04,400
And then I'm getting
threatening voice calls

1252
00:44:04,503 --> 00:44:06,126
and text messages.

1253
00:44:06,229 --> 00:44:08,438
And I'm being attacked
and harassed

1254
00:44:08,542 --> 00:44:09,888
and I tell him about it.

1255
00:44:09,992 --> 00:44:12,270
And I tell... I show him
what they're saying to me

1256
00:44:12,373 --> 00:44:14,652
and he does nothing.
And then I find out

1257
00:44:14,755 --> 00:44:17,206
that he drinking alcohol
behind my back.

1258
00:44:17,309 --> 00:44:18,966
Because he'll do it
on one night...

1259
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:20,968
Because he'll know that
it'll be out of his system

1260
00:44:21,072 --> 00:44:22,383
by his next meeting.

1261
00:44:22,487 --> 00:44:25,145
And then I find out
that he'll be smoking something

1262
00:44:25,248 --> 00:44:27,837
that wont show up in a test
or doing something

1263
00:44:27,941 --> 00:44:29,874
and it's like,
don't sit here and tell me

1264
00:44:29,977 --> 00:44:32,393
that you want to be
in your daughters life

1265
00:44:32,497 --> 00:44:35,534
if you, right now,
are supplementing your addiction

1266
00:44:35,638 --> 00:44:36,708
with something else.

1267
00:44:36,812 --> 00:44:37,985
>>: Two things
I would advice you.

1268
00:44:38,089 --> 00:44:39,538
One is I would
call his treatment program

1269
00:44:39,642 --> 00:44:40,850
and tell them.>>: I did.

1270
00:44:40,954 --> 00:44:42,300
>>: And, number two,

1271
00:44:42,403 --> 00:44:44,889
um, he's not allowed to see her
if he's using. Period.

1272
00:44:45,648 --> 00:44:48,064
>>: I just... I told him, I said
I want him out of my life.

1273
00:44:48,168 --> 00:44:50,446
I want him to sign
his rights over to me.

1274
00:44:50,549 --> 00:44:51,896
Just walk away

1275
00:44:51,999 --> 00:44:53,173
and let me find somebody else

1276
00:44:53,276 --> 00:44:54,795
that's gonna make it better
for her.

1277
00:44:54,899 --> 00:44:56,003
>>: What does he say to that?

1278
00:44:56,107 --> 00:44:58,419
>>: Nothing. He'll leave,
disappear

1279
00:44:58,523 --> 00:45:00,594
and then I'll get a phone call
later saying, "I love you

1280
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:01,940
and I'm sorry and I miss you.

1281
00:45:02,044 --> 00:45:03,942
And I want to be with you guys."

1282
00:45:04,046 --> 00:45:05,426
>>: When was the last time
you guys hooked up?

1283
00:45:06,255 --> 00:45:07,532
>>: A week
and a half ago.

1284
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:11,536
>>: Ten days ago.>>: Mmm-hmm.

1285
00:45:12,123 --> 00:45:14,021
>>: This is a pretty
tumultuous relationship.

1286
00:45:14,125 --> 00:45:15,678
>>: It's constantly
back and forth

1287
00:45:15,782 --> 00:45:17,507
and I can't take it.>>: Intense.

1288
00:45:18,129 --> 00:45:19,717
It's an intense relationship.

1289
00:45:20,545 --> 00:45:23,306
Now, it seemed like he was
pushing the adoption idea

1290
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:25,377
and certainly your mom was.>>: Yeah.

1291
00:45:25,481 --> 00:45:27,138
>>: Tell me your thoughts
about that now.

1292
00:45:28,242 --> 00:45:30,348
>>: I still agree
with adoption.

1293
00:45:30,831 --> 00:45:31,867
Um...

1294
00:45:31,970 --> 00:45:33,006
>>: I've-->>: Would that have been,

1295
00:45:33,109 --> 00:45:34,317
Let me ask you
a tough question.

1296
00:45:34,421 --> 00:45:35,077
Would that have been better
for Arabella?

1297
00:45:35,767 --> 00:45:36,872
>>: I don't know.

1298
00:45:36,975 --> 00:45:38,218
>>: She wouldn't have
to deal with Matt.

1299
00:45:38,770 --> 00:45:39,771
She wouldn't have you

1300
00:45:39,875 --> 00:45:40,910
but you could've
an open adoption

1301
00:45:41,014 --> 00:45:42,118
where they could've...

1302
00:45:42,222 --> 00:45:43,464
>>: And I couldn't
have handled that.

1303
00:45:44,017 --> 00:45:45,121
I... I...

1304
00:45:45,225 --> 00:45:46,295
>>: Yeah, but you couldn't
have handled that.

1305
00:45:46,398 --> 00:45:47,468
Was that the right thing
for the child?

1306
00:45:47,572 --> 00:45:48,849
>>: No.>>: At one point

1307
00:45:48,953 --> 00:45:50,471
you had spoken
to a friend's parents

1308
00:45:50,575 --> 00:45:52,370
about adopting Arabella.>>: Mmm-hmm.

1309
00:45:52,473 --> 00:45:54,199
>>: Do you guys
still talk about that

1310
00:45:54,303 --> 00:45:56,236
or is that something
you contemplate?

1311
00:45:56,339 --> 00:45:57,789
>>: No.>>: Is that door shut?

1312
00:45:57,893 --> 00:45:59,066
>>: That door is shut.

1313
00:45:59,929 --> 00:46:02,725
I... After she was
a few weeks old

1314
00:46:02,829 --> 00:46:05,521
I did think about it
a little bit

1315
00:46:05,624 --> 00:46:07,523
but I can't let her go.

1316
00:46:07,626 --> 00:46:09,318
I have panic attacks
when I'm away from her

1317
00:46:09,421 --> 00:46:10,975
for just like five hours.

1318
00:46:11,078 --> 00:46:14,150
You know, I love having
that girl around me.

1319
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:16,774
>>: Do you think
Matt will be in your life

1320
00:46:16,877 --> 00:46:18,154
ten years from now?>>: Nope.

1321
00:46:18,741 --> 00:46:19,673
I don't want him there.

1322
00:46:20,053 --> 00:46:21,399
>>: You hooked up with him
ten days ago.

1323
00:46:21,502 --> 00:46:23,332
>>: I know.
That's my biggest problem

1324
00:46:23,435 --> 00:46:25,265
I have right now is that
I always go back to him

1325
00:46:25,368 --> 00:46:26,956
because I care about him
that much.

1326
00:46:27,060 --> 00:46:28,544
>>: What are your biggest fears
for Arabella?

1327

>>: Being in the situation
that I am.

1328

the stress of everything

that was happening.

1555
00:54:36,342 --> 00:54:39,552
And like, so much stuff came
crashing down on us at once.

1556
00:54:39,655 --> 00:54:42,071
And it was like
the hormones and...

1557

from divorced families

1561
00:54:51,357 --> 00:54:54,532
and so we've never really seen
a relationship work.

1562
00:54:54,636 --> 00:54:57,846

And, um, he works

1567
00:55:05,716 --> 00:55:07,096

1570
00:55:10,203 --> 00:55:11,722
So you are able
to live independently

1571

1572
00:55:13,206 --> 00:55:15,933

night shifts, so...

1573

00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,180
Would you worry
about his safety?

>>: Yeah, sometimes
I can't sleep at night.

1577
00:55:24,390 --> 00:55:26,599
'Cause I am afraid, like,
that something is gonna happen.

1578
00:55:26,702 --> 00:55:28,255
And then he comes homes
and he is like,

1579
00:55:28,359 --> 00:55:30,948
"Three ambulance came on
to my work today."

1580
00:55:31,638 --> 00:55:34,123
And I really don't wanna know
what happens

1581
00:55:34,227 --> 00:55:37,437
because it just makes things
harder for me.

1582
00:55:37,541 --> 00:55:39,819
You hear about cave-ins
all the time on the news.

1583
00:55:39,922 --> 00:55:41,545
[Drew] Yeah.>>: And...

1584
00:55:41,648 --> 00:55:44,410
I couldn't imagine what my life
would be like without him.

1585
00:55:44,513 --> 00:55:47,274
And I definitely won't be able
to do it without him.

1586
00:55:47,378 --> 00:55:48,655
>>: What are you doing
for birth control now?

1587

100% birth control.

00:55:50,899 --> 00:55:52,694

You've got three protections.

[Katie] Yes.>>: Breast feeding, condom...

1595
00:56:02,945 --> 00:56:04,947
Breast feeding reduces
the risk of pregnancy.

Condom and IUD.[Katie] Yes.

1597
00:56:06,742 --> 00:56:09,089
>>: And did you think
about abortion or adoption

1598
00:56:09,193 --> 00:56:10,228
once you got pregnant?

1599
00:56:10,332 --> 00:56:12,092
>>: We considered
adoption, but--

1600
00:56:12,196 --> 00:56:13,508
>>: I did not
consider adoption.

1601
00:56:13,611 --> 00:56:15,855
You considered adoption.>>: I considered adoption.

1602
00:56:15,958 --> 00:56:17,926
We brought home, like,
these little books,

1603
00:56:18,029 --> 00:56:21,343
like, they make scrapbooks
with possible parents.

1604
00:56:21,447 --> 00:56:22,689
And we looked through it

1605
00:56:22,793 --> 00:56:25,174
and we sat down
with both of our parents.

1606
00:56:25,278 --> 00:56:26,797
And both of our parents
pretty much thought

1607
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:29,316
that it was our choice
in the end,

1608
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,457
and they'd support us
no matter what.

1609
00:56:31,560 --> 00:56:34,287
That's the way they are
and we realized

1610
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,393
how supportive of a system
we had

1611
00:56:36,496 --> 00:56:39,188
and that we have
a lot of love to give.

1612

>>: And how have
you changed your life?

1613
00:56:41,156 --> 00:56:43,572
>>: I didn't get
to go to school.

1614
00:56:43,676 --> 00:56:46,472
I didn't, like, get to go do
all my clubs stuff and--

1615
00:56:46,575 --> 00:56:48,232
>>: You were gonna go to Denver
to go to school, right?

1616
00:56:48,335 --> 00:56:50,890
>>: Yeah, my best friend
lives there now

1617
00:56:50,993 --> 00:56:53,271
and I don't. [chuckles]

1618
00:56:53,375 --> 00:56:56,240
So I gave up that,
like, all of my plans

1619
00:56:56,343 --> 00:56:57,828
for school

1620
00:56:57,931 --> 00:57:01,383

1622
00:57:02,764 --> 00:57:04,524

at point you felt lonely.

1624
00:57:06,043 --> 00:57:08,390

went away and...

Or they are doing other things.

We're completely different.

So, we don't really have
anything to talk about.

00:57:13,878 --> 00:57:17,157
Like the times
that I do spent with them,

1629
00:57:17,261 --> 00:57:18,711
it's weird.

1631
00:57:20,609 --> 00:57:22,680
the direction

00:57:22,784 --> 00:57:24,164
>>: Oh, yeah.>>: Yeah.

1633
00:57:24,268 --> 00:57:26,063

flipped it around.
