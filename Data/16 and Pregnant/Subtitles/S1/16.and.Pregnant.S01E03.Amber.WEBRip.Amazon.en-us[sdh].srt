I DIDN'T EVEN WANT KIDS.

I DON'T THINK I'VE EVER MET YOU

192
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:10,778

00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,347
>> YOU WERE?

196
00:05:13,347 --> 00:05:15,416
YOU BEEN SEEING HIM THAT LONG?

WERE YOU GUYS TALKING ABOUT

200
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:19,653
GETTING MARRIED?

201
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,321
>> UH, YEAH.

202
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:22,222

207
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:27,961
I MEAN, I'M PRETTY SURE HER DAD

208
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:29,196
WOULDN'T CARE.

209
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:31,098
BUT HER MOM, I'M NOT SURE YET.

210
00:05:31,098 --> 00:05:31,865
>> YEAH.

211
00:05:31,865 --> 00:05:33,066
WELL, ONCE THE BABY COMES,

212
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:33,767
THAT WILL HELP.

213
00:05:33,767 --> 00:05:35,035
IT'S GOOD SEEING YOU GUYS.

214
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:36,370
TAKE CARE.

215
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,270
BUH-BYE.

216
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,439
>> HEY, YOU THINK YOUR MOM WILL

217
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:40,240
GET ALONG WITH MY FAMILY?

218
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,443
>> YEAH, IF YOUR MOM TONES IT

219
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:43,811
DOWN A BIT.

220
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:46,346

>> GRAB THESE TOO.

226
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:17,878
>> WE FOUND A CRIB AT A GARAGE

227
00:06:17,878 --> 00:06:19,980

YOU DID A GOOD JOB.

241
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:40,133
YOU WANT TO WASH YOUR HANDS

242
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:44,705
FROM TOUCHING THAT OLD CRIB?

243
00:06:44,705 --> 00:06:45,906
>> IT'S SO WEIRD.

244
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:47,074
THAT CRIB BEING UP LIKE THAT

245
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,076
IS LIKE--I MEAN, IT'S JUST WEIRD

246
00:06:49,076 --> 00:06:51,111
SEEING THE CRIB.

247
00:06:51,111 --> 00:06:53,113

00:07:17,638 --> 00:07:18,839
DID YOU JUST BUY THAT?

252
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:19,507
>> YEAH.

253
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:20,340
>> HOW MUCH WAS IT?

254
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,208
>> IT WAS, LIKE, A COUPLE

255
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:21,975
HUNDRED DOLLARS.

256
00:07:21,975 --> 00:07:23,777
>> WHAT'S A COUPLE HUNDRED?

257
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:24,878
>> LIKE, $500.

258
00:07:24,878 --> 00:07:26,146
>> $500 IS NOT A COUPLE HUNDRED.

259
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:27,180
A COUPLE MEANS $200.

260
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,381
THAT'S MONEY WE COULD BE SAVING

261
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:29,349
UP FOR THE BABY.

262
00:07:29,349 --> 00:07:30,217
>> I GOT MONEY.

263
00:07:30,217 --> 00:07:31,384

271
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,328

>> YEAH.

277
00:08:05,252 --> 00:08:06,253
I DON'T KNOW IF I SHOULD BE

278
00:08:06,253 --> 00:08:10,323
TELLING YOU THIS, BUT HE JUST

279
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:12,325
BOUGHT HIM A BRAND-NEW

280
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:14,127
PLAYSTATION 3.

281
00:08:14,127 --> 00:08:16,263
IT WAS $500.

282
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:18,065
>> WHY?

283
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:19,432
>> I DON'T KNOW, MOM.

284
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:20,634
>> HE'S GOT HIS PRIORITIES ALL

285
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:22,102
SCREWED UP, THEN.

286
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,604
HE WORKS HARD FOR HIS MONEY,

287
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:24,772
BUT, YOU KNOW, HE'S THE ONE THAT

288
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:27,007
GOT HIMSELF INTO THIS MESS.

289
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:29,009
YOU BOTH DID.

290
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:42,389
[phone ringing]

291
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:43,390
HEY, DAD.

00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,124
ARE YOU GONNA COME TO THE

00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:46,059
BARBECUE?

294
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,231
>> MM.

I'M SURE MOM TALKED TO YOU.

296
00:08:54,635 --> 00:08:56,369
>> NO, HE'S NOT HERE RIGHT NOW.

297
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:58,405
HE'S UPSTAIRS.

298
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,212
>> I SHOULDN'T HAVE TOLD HER.

299
00:09:11,018 --> 00:09:13,020
>> ALL RIGHT, WELL--

300
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:15,188
>> YEAH, THAT WOULD BE GOOD.

301
00:09:15,188 --> 00:09:16,056
BYE, DADDY.

302

>> BYE.

303

>> YOUR FAMILY [bleep] PISSES ME

304
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,027
OFF, FOR REAL.

305
00:09:20,027 --> 00:09:20,761
>> WHY, BECAUSE THEY CARE

306
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:21,929
ABOUT ME?

307
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:22,696
>> WHY DID YOU TELL YOUR MOM

308
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:23,330
ABOUT THE PS3?

309
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,064
YOU SAID YOU WOULDN'T.

310
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:24,832
IT MAKES ME LOOK LIKE AN ASS

311
00:09:24,832 --> 00:09:25,532
WHEN I WORKED OVERTIME--

312
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:26,333
>> BECAUSE YOU ARE AN ASS FOR

STUPID MONEY.

319
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:33,440
I HATE MONEY.

>> WHY ARE YOU SO MAD IF YOU

321
00:09:34,207 --> 00:09:34,875
DID IT?

322
00:09:34,875 --> 00:09:35,843
>> BECAUSE OF YOUR MOM NEEDS TO

323
00:09:35,843 --> 00:09:36,543
SHUT HER [bleep] MOUTH.

324
00:09:36,543 --> 00:09:37,410
>> YOU WON'T SAY THAT TO HER

>> WHAT DOES SHE CALL ME, AN

327
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:40,013
INBRED PIECE OF [bleep]?

328
00:09:40,013 --> 00:09:41,849

SHE CAN GO SOMEWHERE.

333
00:09:46,219 --> 00:09:47,821
>> I AM A TEENAGER.

334
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:49,122
YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND.

335
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:49,790
YOU DO UNDERSTAND.

336
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,924
>> I DO UNDERSTAND.

337

339
00:09:54,394 --> 00:09:55,528
THAT.

340
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:56,296
YOU DON'T CARE.

341
00:09:56,296 --> 00:09:57,164
>> ABOUT WHAT?

342
00:09:57,164 --> 00:09:59,166
>> ABOUT ME.

343
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:03,070
IT'S LIKE, EVER SINCE WE'VE

344
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,004
BEEN TOGETHER, IT'S LIKE HE'S

345
00:10:04,004 --> 00:10:04,504
CHANGED.

346
00:10:04,504 --> 00:10:06,039
IT'S LIKE, GETTING OLDER,

347
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,140
IT'S LIKE HE'S TURNING MORE

348
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,977
INTO AN ASS[bleep].

349
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:12,479
>> OH, I CAN FEEL IT BURNING.

350
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,183
>> YOU'RE THE ONE THAT, YOU

351
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:18,585
KNOW, KNOCKED HER UP, SO...

352
00:10:18,585 --> 00:10:19,753
>> I SAID, "IF YOU KEEP ON

353
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:20,654
ACTING LIKE THIS, I'M NOT GONNA

354
00:10:20,654 --> 00:10:21,922
BE WITH YOU."

355
00:10:21,922 --> 00:10:23,156
THE GOOD THING ABOUT LIVING

356
00:10:23,156 --> 00:10:24,958
RIGHT NEAR MY MOM IS, I ALWAYS

357
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,093
HAVE A PLACE TO GO WHEN THINGS

358
00:10:26,093 --> 00:10:28,228
GET TOUGH.

359
00:10:28,228 --> 00:10:29,396
>> WE'RE GONNA GET A STROLLER.

360
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:30,530
I NEED TO BUY, YOU KNOW, ALL

361
00:10:30,530 --> 00:10:31,231
THIS STUFF FOR THE BABY.

362
00:10:31,231 --> 00:10:32,065
>> EVERYTHING IS EXPENSIVE.

363
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,333
BABIES AREN'T CHEAP, MAN.

364
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,601
>> THE BABY'S NOT EVEN HERE.

365
00:10:34,601 --> 00:10:36,336
YOU KNOW, I'M BROKE.

366
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:38,038
>> SO THIS IS YOUR ROOM?

367
00:10:38,038 --> 00:10:39,306
>> I LOVE THIS ROOM.

368
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:40,340
BEING IN THIS ROOM MAKES ME

369
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,709
REALIZE HOW MUCH MY LIFE HAS

370
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:43,110
CHANGED IN THESE LAST FEW

371
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,144
MONTHS.

>> HAVE YOU HEARD FROM YOUR

375
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:49,016
BROTHER?

376
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:50,317

00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:20,032
WE'RE COMING HOME WITH A LITTLE

755
00:23:20,032 --> 00:23:24,370
BABY GIRL.

756
00:23:24,370 --> 00:23:25,505
>> I AM SO READY TO HAVE THIS

757
00:23:25,505 --> 00:23:29,175
BABY.

758
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:30,076
GOD, I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR YOU

759
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:30,677

>> UM, I'VE BEEN PUKING ALL DAY

768
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:44,757
LONG.

769
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:45,424
>> I KNOW.

770
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:46,859
WHAT'S GOING ON WITH THAT?

771
00:23:46,859 --> 00:23:47,827
>> I DON'T KNOW.

772
00:23:47,827 --> 00:23:48,995
>> BUT HOW COME YOU CAN THROW UP

773
00:23:48,995 --> 00:23:50,229
AND THEN EAT TACO BELL?

774
00:23:50,229 --> 00:23:50,897
>> I DON'T KNOW.

775
00:23:50,897 --> 00:23:51,864
>> I DON'T GET IT...

776
00:23:51,864 --> 00:23:52,965
>> I DON'T KNOW.

777
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:53,833
>> AT ALL.

778
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:55,735
ARE YOU NERVOUS?

779
00:23:55,735 --> 00:23:57,770
>> UH-HUH.

780
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:04,944
I FEEL IT.

781
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:05,978
>> I'M SORRY, AMBER.

782
00:24:05,978 --> 00:24:07,413
NOW WE HAVE THE PITOCIN.

783
00:24:07,413 --> 00:24:08,648
OKAY, IT'S GONNA HOOK RIGHT INTO

784
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:10,750
YOUR OTHER IV FLUID.

785
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,851
AND THIS WILL HELP INDUCE THE

786
00:24:11,851 --> 00:24:12,519
LABOR.

787
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,753
>> LIQUID LABOR.

788
00:24:13,753 --> 00:24:15,622
>> LIQUID LABOR.

789
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:16,623
>> ONCE THIS REALLY HITS YOUR

790
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:17,490
SYSTEM, YOU'LL START TO FEEL

791
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:18,758
MORE CONTRACTIONS, AND THEY'LL

792
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:19,992
GET A LITTLE BIT MORE INTENSE.

793
00:24:19,992 --> 00:24:21,994
OKAY?

794
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:28,134
>> [breathing heavily]

795
00:24:30,236 --> 00:24:31,170
>> JUST KEEP BREATHING LIKE SHE

796
00:24:31,170 --> 00:24:38,010
SAID.

797
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,946
>> I KEEP HAVING CONTRACTIONS.

798
00:24:39,946 --> 00:24:41,113
>> TRY TO TAKE SOME NICE, SLOW

799
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:42,014
BREATHS.

800
00:24:42,014 --> 00:24:45,685
I KNOW IT HURTS.

801
00:24:45,685 --> 00:24:46,553
>> I DON'T THINK SHE REALIZED

802
00:24:46,553 --> 00:24:47,654
IT WAS GONNA BE THAT HARD.

803
00:24:47,654 --> 00:24:49,255
>> HER CONTRACTIONS ARE GETTING

804
00:24:49,255 --> 00:24:50,523
BIGGER AND LONGER.

805
00:24:50,523 --> 00:24:51,858
>> THEY'RE GONNA GET A LOT

806
00:24:51,858 --> 00:24:53,660
BIGGER.

807
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,028
>> I NEED SOMETHING.

808
00:24:56,028 --> 00:24:56,896
THE PAIN IS--

809
00:24:56,896 --> 00:24:57,797
[sobbing]

810
00:24:57,797 --> 00:24:58,965
>> OKAY, I HAVE TO CHECK YOU

811
00:24:58,965 --> 00:25:00,266
FIRST.

812
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:00,933
>> I CAN'T.

813
00:25:00,933 --> 00:25:01,934
PLEASE STOP.

814
00:25:01,934 --> 00:25:03,670
>> OKAY, AMBER, TAKE A NICE BIG,

815
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:04,336
DEEP BREATH.

816
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:05,171
>> JUST KEEP BREATHING.

817
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:07,640
>> OW, PLEASE STOP.

818
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:09,676
STOP.

819
00:25:16,148 --> 00:25:18,017
>> AMBER, YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

820
00:25:18,017 --> 00:25:19,686
YOU'RE 100% THINNED OUT.

821
00:25:19,686 --> 00:25:20,452
>> AM I READY FOR EPIDURAL?

822
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:21,420
>> YOU ARE READY FOR AN

823
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,088
EPIDURAL.

824
00:25:22,088 --> 00:25:22,922
>> YAY.

825
00:25:22,922 --> 00:25:25,024
[laughter]

826
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:25,792
>> THEY JUST GAVE HER THE

827
00:25:25,792 --> 00:25:26,425
EPIDURAL.

828
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:27,126
>> IS SHE DOING BETTER?

829
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:28,661
>> IT'S A GOOD EPIDURAL IN THAT

830
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:30,563
IT'S HELPING YOUR PAIN, BUT YOU

831
00:25:30,563 --> 00:25:32,298
CAN STILL MOVE.

832
00:25:32,298 --> 00:25:33,700
>> AM I HAVING A CONTRACTION?

833
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,634
I FEEL THE TIGHTNESS.

834
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:35,301
>> YEAH.

835
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:37,036
MUCH BETTER, HUH?

836
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:37,837
>> YEAH.

837
00:25:37,837 --> 00:25:38,571
>> I CAN TELL YOU LOVE HER

838
00:25:38,571 --> 00:25:39,538
A LOT.

839
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,339
>> YEAH.

840
00:25:40,339 --> 00:25:41,140
EVEN THOUGH WE FIGHT AND SAY

841
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,942
THINGS, I STILL LOVE HER.

842
00:25:42,942 --> 00:25:43,876
>> YEAH, EVERYBODY'S GONNA FIGHT

843
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:44,944
AND ARGUE.

844
00:25:44,944 --> 00:25:47,179
>> YEAH, YEAH, TOTALLY.

845
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:48,247
>> SHE'S FEELING SOME PRESSURE

846
00:25:48,247 --> 00:25:49,415
IN HER BUTT.

847
00:25:49,415 --> 00:25:50,116
>> IS THAT A GOOD THING?

848
00:25:50,116 --> 00:25:51,584
>> THAT'S A VERY GOOD THING.

849
00:25:51,584 --> 00:25:53,119
I THINK THAT WE CAN HAVE HER

850
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:55,487
START PUSHING, AND WE CAN KIND

851
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:57,056
OF GET READY FOR THIS DELIVERY.

852
00:25:57,056 --> 00:25:59,525
OKAY?

853
00:25:59,525 --> 00:26:00,993
OKAY, I WANT YOU TO PUT YOUR

854
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:02,662

00:26:06,833 --> 00:26:08,134
HOLD IT TO THE COUNT OF TEN.

00:26:08,134 --> 00:26:09,869
>> OKAY, LET'S SEE.

859
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:10,536

00:26:13,906 --> 00:26:14,841
>> YOU'RE DOING PERFECT.

865
00:26:14,841 --> 00:26:15,975
>> IS THE HEAD SHOWING?

866
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:16,909
>> NOT YET.

867
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,110
>> I MEAN, IT'S IN THERE.

868
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,647
>> [laughing] IT'S IN THERE.

869
00:26:20,647 --> 00:26:21,748
>> TAKE THE SHEET AND PULL ON IT

870
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:23,716
NOW WHEN YOU PUSH.

871
00:26:23,716 --> 00:26:24,851
>> PUSH, PUSH, PUSH, PUSH, PUSH.

872
00:26:24,851 --> 00:26:25,584
>> GOOD.

873
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:28,487
YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

OKAY, TAKE A COUPLE BIG DEEP

00:26:35,561 --> 00:26:37,063
PUSH REALLY HARD INTO YOUR

YOU'RE DOING GREAT.

LET'S CHANGE POSITION

888

A LITTLE BIT.

889
00:26:47,473 --> 00:26:48,675
OKAY?

890

THAT'S A GIRL, JUST LIKE THAT.

ISN'T IT, AMBER?

913
00:27:21,173 --> 00:27:21,874
IT'S A TON OF WORK.

914
00:27:21,874 --> 00:27:23,843
I KNOW IT.

915
00:27:25,177 --> 00:27:25,845
OH.

>> I KNOW.

917
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:31,117
>> I REALLY DON'T THINK YOU NEED

918
00:27:31,117 --> 00:27:33,119
A C-SECTION.

919
00:27:35,254 --> 00:27:36,255
>> I KNOW YOU'RE WEAK.

00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:39,992
>> I'M REALLY, REALLY WEAK.

923
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,162
>> I CAN'T PUSH.

924
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:47,299
>> LET YOUR BODY JUST DO ITS OWN

925
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:49,668
THING FOR A FEW MINUTES.

926
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:52,004

>> OKAY, I'M JUST GONNA CHECK

929
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:00,246
AND SEE IF THE BABY'S MOVED DOWN

930
00:28:00,246 --> 00:28:02,949
ANY MORE SINCE--OKAY?

931
00:28:02,949 --> 00:28:05,584
HONESTLY, THE BABY IS REALLY

932
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:07,486
RIGHT THERE.

933
00:28:07,486 --> 00:28:08,788
I REALLY THINK YOU COULD PUSH

934
00:28:08,788 --> 00:28:11,123
THIS BABY OUT.

935
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:12,524
YOU WANT TO TRY IT?

936
00:28:12,524 --> 00:28:14,093
>> SURE.

IS EVERYBODY READY?

939
00:28:17,797 --> 00:28:18,697
>> YEAH, WE'RE READY.

941
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:20,900
PUSH DOWN HARD INTO YOUR

00:33:55,101 --> 00:33:56,435
THERE'S A DIAPER ON THE FLOOR.

1132
00:33:56,435 --> 00:33:58,370
NOTE TO SELF--OR TO YOU

1133
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,771
ACTUALLY--LIKE, IF YOU FILL UP

1134
00:33:59,771 --> 00:34:02,474
A TRASH THING, LIKE, BRING IT

1135
00:34:02,474 --> 00:34:03,709
DOWNSTAIRS.

1136
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:04,776
>> I'VE BEEN BUSY WORKING.

1137
00:34:04,776 --> 00:34:05,611
THEN I COME HOME AND TAKE

1138
00:34:05,611 --> 00:34:06,645
CARE OF A BABY.

1139
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:07,846
>> OH, MY GOD.

1140
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:09,781
CRY ME A RIVER, GARY.

1141
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,350
EVEN WITH GARY PICKING UP EXTRA

1142
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:13,985
SHIFTS, MONEY WAS STILL TIGHT,

1143
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:15,154
AS WE HAD ALL SORTS OF NEW

1144
00:34:15,154 --> 00:34:18,657
EXPENSES: FORMULA, DIAPERS,

1145
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:21,059
CLOTHES, AND TOYS.

1146
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,928
ADD THAT TO CONSTANT CLEANING

1147
00:34:22,928 --> 00:34:24,630
AND LACK OF SLEEP, I FOUND

1148
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:25,897
MYSELF ON THE VERGE

1149
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:27,599
OF LOSING IT.

1150
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,602
[baby crying]

1151
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:34,773
>> WHAT?

1152
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:36,375
WHAT?

1153
00:34:36,375 --> 00:34:37,743
>> WE NEED TO GET TO SLEEP.

1154
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:38,677
>> YOU NEED TO GET TO SLEEP?

1155
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:39,511
I DIDN'T GET NO SLEEP LAST

1156
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:40,078
NIGHT.

1157
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:40,879
>> HOW MANY HOURS OF SLEEP DID

1158
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:41,547
YOU GET?

1159
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:42,248
>> FOUR.

1160
00:34:42,248 --> 00:34:43,014
>> OKAY, NOW, LISTEN.

1161
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:44,183
I DO THAT FOUR DAYS IN A [bleep]

1162
00:34:44,183 --> 00:34:45,184
ROW.

1163
00:34:45,184 --> 00:34:46,318
>> WHEN I WORK 40 HOURS IN THE

1164
00:34:46,318 --> 00:34:48,086
WEEKEND AND ALL YOU DO IS STAY

1165
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,221
HOME AND TAKE CARE OF THE LITTLE

1166
00:34:49,221 --> 00:34:50,789
ONE, WHICH I WOULD RATHER DO.

1167
00:34:50,789 --> 00:34:52,458
>> YOU GET MORE SLEEP THAN I DO

1168
00:34:52,458 --> 00:34:54,326
WORKING THOSE 40 HOURS.

1169
00:34:54,326 --> 00:34:55,093
>> AND YOU COULD BE SLEEPING

1170
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:55,827
RIGHT NOW, BUT YOU WANT TO

1171
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:56,462
ARGUE.

1172
00:34:56,462 --> 00:34:57,329
>> I CAN'T GO TO SLEEP RIGHT

1173
00:34:57,329 --> 00:34:57,896
NOW.

1174
00:34:57,896 --> 00:34:58,564
YOU GOT THE LIGHT ON.

1175
00:34:58,564 --> 00:34:59,465
YOU'RE OVER HERE POUNDING ON

1176
00:34:59,465 --> 00:35:00,166
THE BABY.

1177
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:02,067
SHE'S CRYING.

1178
00:35:02,067 --> 00:35:04,035
>> ARE YOU CRYING?

1179
00:35:04,035 --> 00:35:04,936
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO WATCH HER,

1180
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:05,604
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

1181
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:06,905
I'LL DO IT ALL.

1182
00:35:06,905 --> 00:35:09,408
>> IT'S NOT ABOUT WANTING, GARY.

1183
00:35:09,408 --> 00:35:11,277
IT'S ABOUT NEEDING TO GET SLEEP

1184
00:35:11,277 --> 00:35:12,444
SO I CAN MAKE IT THROUGH THE

1185
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:14,180
[bleep] WEEKEND.

1186
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,881
>> OKAY, MY MOM WILL WATCH HER--

1187
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:17,483
>> WHY DOES YOUR MOM NEED TO

1188
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:18,984
WATCH HER WHEN SHE HAS

1189
00:35:18,984 --> 00:35:19,885
A FREAKING FATHER TO WATCH HER?

1190
00:35:19,885 --> 00:35:20,786
>> 'CAUSE YOU'RE COMPLAINING

1191
00:35:20,786 --> 00:35:21,820
ABOUT WATCHING HER, AMBER.

1192
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,589
>> I'M NOT COMPLAINING.

1193
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:24,790
YOU ARE SO LUCKY RIGHT NOW

1194
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:26,358
YOU'RE HOLDING THE BABY.

1195
00:35:26,358 --> 00:35:29,361
>> WHY, YOU GONNA HIT ME?

1196
00:35:42,608 --> 00:35:44,610
NIGHT, LEAH.

1197
00:35:56,054 --> 00:35:57,623
>> THINGS MELLOWED OUT, AND

00:35:57,623 --> 00:35:58,790
GARY AND I SETTLED INTO

1199
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:01,260
A COMFORTABLE ROUTINE.

1200
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:04,196
GARY.

1201
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:05,231
BUT AS SOON AS I STARTED

1202
00:36:05,231 --> 00:36:06,265
GETTING SOME REST...

1203
00:36:06,265 --> 00:36:07,566
SHE'S BREATHING HEAVY RIGHT NOW.

1204
00:36:07,566 --> 00:36:08,300
YOU CAN HEAR IT.

1205
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,001
SOMETHING WAS GOING ON WITH OUR

1206
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,203
BABY'S BREATHING.

1207
00:36:11,203 --> 00:36:12,904
>> [labored breathing]

1208
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:14,973
[wheezing]

1209
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:16,174
>> THAT'S WHAT I'M WORRIED

1210
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:16,842
ABOUT.

1211
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:18,510

1212
00:36:18,510 --> 00:36:19,711
>> YEAH, WE NEED TO GET AN

1213
00:36:19,711 --> 00:36:22,881
APPOINTMENT FOR OUR DAUGHTER.

1214
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:24,015
SHE'S HAVING BREATHING PROBLEMS.

1215
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:25,183
LIKE, SHE STOPS BREATHING.

1216
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,352
AND SHE KIND OF GASPS FOR AIR

1217
00:36:26,352 --> 00:36:29,054
SOMETIMES.

1218
00:36:29,054 --> 00:36:30,256
DO YOU KNOW HOW THE PROCEDURE

1219
00:36:30,256 --> 00:36:32,258
WORKS?

1220
00:36:42,268 --> 00:36:43,469
>> WELL, THEY TOLD ME THAT THERE

1221
00:36:43,469 --> 00:36:44,970
MIGHT BE A NOSEBLEED.

1222
00:36:44,970 --> 00:36:46,972
SO THIS KIND OF WORRIES US.

1223
00:36:51,176 --> 00:36:51,910
>> OKAY.

1224
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:52,878
>> OKAY?

1225
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:53,579
THANK YOU.

1226
00:36:53,579 --> 00:36:55,481
>> AND WE'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW.

1227
00:36:55,481 --> 00:36:56,315
>> I DON'T WANT TO SEE THEM

1228
00:36:56,315 --> 00:36:57,583
STICK IT UP HER NOSE.

1229
00:36:57,583 --> 00:37:00,586
YOU KNOW, I WORRY ABOUT HER.

1230
00:37:05,991 --> 00:37:07,459
>> SO LEAH'S SEEING A SPECIALIST

1231
00:37:07,459 --> 00:37:08,594
IN INDIANAPOLIS TO FIND OUT

1232
00:37:08,594 --> 00:37:10,596
WHAT'S WRONG.

1233
00:37:13,532 --> 00:37:14,232
>> HI.

1234
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,601
>> HOW YOU DOING?

1235
00:37:15,601 --> 00:37:16,435
>> GOOD TO SEE YOU.

1236
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:17,102
HEY.

1237
00:37:17,102 --> 00:37:17,803
HOW'S LEAH DOING?

1238
00:37:17,803 --> 00:37:18,470
>> GOOD.

1239
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,204
>> GOOD.

1240
00:37:19,204 --> 00:37:19,938
>> SLEEPING.

1241
00:37:19,938 --> 00:37:21,373
>> YEAH, SO WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO

1242
00:37:21,373 --> 00:37:22,341
TODAY IS A PROCEDURE

1243
00:37:22,341 --> 00:37:24,676
CALLED FLEXIBLE BRONCHOSCOPY.

1244
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:26,912
IT TAKES ABOUT FIVE, TEN MINUTES

1245
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,314
TO FINISH THE PROCEDURE.

1246
00:37:28,314 --> 00:37:29,080
PREPARING IT WILL TAKE MORE

1247
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,684
TIME.

1248
00:37:32,684 --> 00:37:35,521
>> IT'S OKAY.

1249
00:37:35,521 --> 00:37:36,455
>> SO THIS IS THE FLEXIBLE

1250
00:37:36,455 --> 00:37:37,389
BRONCHOSCOPE THAT WE'RE

1251
00:37:37,389 --> 00:37:38,056
GONNA USE.

1252
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:40,626
AND IT'S A VERY SMALL SCOPE.

1253
00:37:40,626 --> 00:37:41,893
IT'S VERY FLEXIBLE, SO IT

1254
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:42,694
SHOULDN'T HURT HER.

1255
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:43,862
AND WE COULD MOVE IT UP AND

1256
00:37:43,862 --> 00:37:44,563
DOWN.

1257
00:37:44,563 --> 00:37:46,732
AND IT HAS A CAMERA AND A LIGHT

1258
00:37:46,732 --> 00:37:48,099
AT THE END OF IT.

1259
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:48,967
AND WE COULD SEE THE PICTURE

1260
00:37:48,967 --> 00:37:50,135
HERE ON THESE TWO SCREEN,

1261
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:52,137
AND WE WILL RECORD IT.

1262
00:37:56,808 --> 00:37:59,745
>> SHE'S OKAY, HONEY.

1263
00:37:59,745 --> 00:38:02,748
RIGHT HERE.

1264
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,692
>> THAT THING WAS THICK.

1265
00:38:13,692 --> 00:38:15,427
>> IT'S OKAY.

1266
00:38:15,427 --> 00:38:16,428
>> THEY SAID IT WAS SUPPOSED TO

1267
00:38:16,428 --> 00:38:17,429
BE, LIKE, TINY.

1268
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:18,430
LIKE, THAT'S BIGGER THAN HER

1269
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:20,432
NOSTRIL.

1270
00:38:22,267 --> 00:38:24,269
>> 13 MINUTES ALREADY.

1271
00:38:26,872 --> 00:38:27,706
>> WE'RE DONE WITH LEAH.

1272
00:38:27,706 --> 00:38:29,475
YOU GUYS WANT TO COME ON BACK?

1273
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:31,142
>> OH.

1274
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:31,810
>> SHE'S FINE.

1275
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:32,778
COME ON BACK.

1276
00:38:32,778 --> 00:38:35,481
>> HER LITTLE NOSE IS RED.

1277
00:38:35,481 --> 00:38:36,882
>> LET ME SHOW YOU WHAT I FOUND.

1278
00:38:36,882 --> 00:38:39,385
SO THIS IS HER VOICE BOX HERE.

1279
00:38:39,385 --> 00:38:40,218
THIS STRUCTURE CALLED THE

1280
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:41,052
EPIGLOTTIS,

1281
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:42,654
IT'S LIKE CARTILAGE.

1282
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:43,321
IN HER CASE,

1283
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,323
IT'S VERY SOFT STILL.

1284
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:46,492
IT GOES DOWN AND COVER

1285
00:38:46,492 --> 00:38:48,126
MOST OF HER AIRWAY.

1286
00:38:48,126 --> 00:38:49,761
EVERY TIME SHE TAKE A BREATH,

1287
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:51,062
IT MAKE IT SMALLER.

1288
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:52,564
SO IT BECOME LIKE A WHISTLE.

1289
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:53,499
AND THAT'S WHY SHE'S LIKE...

1290
00:38:53,499 --> 00:38:54,199
[wheezing]

1291
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:55,967
WITH TIME, IT WILL GO AWAY.

1292
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:56,935
BUT--SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY

1293
00:38:56,935 --> 00:38:57,636
ABOUT IT.

1294
00:38:57,636 --> 00:38:58,303
>> YEAH.

1295
00:38:58,303 --> 00:38:58,970
THANK YOU.

1296
00:38:58,970 --> 00:38:59,638
>> THANK YOU.

1297
00:38:59,638 --> 00:39:00,872
>> OH, YOU'RE WELCOME.

1298
00:39:00,872 --> 00:39:02,441
>> RELIEF FLOODED IN WITH THE

00:39:02,441 --> 00:39:03,475

BUT I GOT TO TELL YOU, THIS

1301
00:39:04,643 --> 00:39:07,045
PARENTING THING IS NOT EASY.

1302
00:39:07,045 --> 00:39:08,714
THEN AGAIN, NOBODY SAID

1303
00:39:08,714 --> 00:39:10,716
IT WOULD BE.

1304
00:39:18,557 --> 00:39:20,325
DADDY GONNA SING TO US.

00:39:46,418 --> 00:39:48,920
BEEN.

1316
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,422
NEVER IN A MILLION YEARS

1317
00:39:50,422 --> 00:39:51,389
COULD I HAVE FORESEEN

1318
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:52,390
WHAT HAVING A BABY

1319
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:54,325
WOULD REALLY BE LIKE.

1320
00:39:54,325 --> 00:39:56,662
IT'S JUST WEIRD SEEING THE CRIB.

1321
00:39:56,662 --> 00:39:57,996
MY WHOLE LIFE HAS CHANGED

1322
00:39:57,996 --> 00:39:59,330
NOW THAT I'M RESPONSIBLE FOR

1323
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:00,499
THIS CHILD.

1324
00:40:00,499 --> 00:40:01,767
I NEED YOU HERE RIGHT NOW.

1325
00:40:01,767 --> 00:40:02,768
WHILE GARY AND I HAVE OUR

1326
00:40:02,768 --> 00:40:03,735
DISAGREEMENTS...

1327
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:04,636
$500 IS NOT A COUPLE HUNDRED.

1328
00:40:04,636 --> 00:40:05,437
A COUPLE MEANS $200.

1329
00:40:05,437 --> 00:40:06,337
AND BEING PARENTS

1330
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:07,439
IS A CHALLENGE...

1331
00:40:07,439 --> 00:40:08,306
YOU DON'T CARE.

1332
00:40:08,306 --> 00:40:09,274
>> ABOUT WHAT?

1333
00:40:09,274 --> 00:40:10,241
>> ABOUT ME.

1334
00:40:10,241 --> 00:40:11,076
WE DO OUR BEST TO SPREAD

1335
00:40:11,076 --> 00:40:11,843
THE LOVE.

1336
00:40:11,843 --> 00:40:12,678
>> I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WOULD

1337
00:40:12,678 --> 00:40:13,411
MARRY ME.

1338
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,714
>> GIVE ME A HUGE PUSH.

1339
00:40:15,714 --> 00:40:17,516
>> AND GARY NEVER CEASES TO

1340
00:40:17,516 --> 00:40:19,284
SURPRISE ME WITH HIS RANDOM ACTS

1341
00:40:19,284 --> 00:40:20,351
OF SWEETNESS.

1342
00:40:20,351 --> 00:40:21,252
>> * DON'T STICK *

1343
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,020
* YOUR TONGUE AT ME

1344
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,222
[laughter]

1345
00:40:24,222 --> 00:40:26,091
>> NO ONE SAID BEING A TEEN MOM

1346
00:40:26,091 --> 00:40:27,392
WAS GOING TO BE EASY.

1347
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,527
[chime dings]

1348
00:40:28,527 --> 00:40:29,828
AHEAD LIE MANY UNANSWERED

1349
00:40:29,828 --> 00:40:31,930
QUESTIONS, LIKE WILL GARY AND

1350
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,431
I ACTUALLY GET MARRIED?

1351
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:35,300
WILL WE HAVE MORE KIDS?

1352
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,502
WILL WE EVER BE ABLE TO MAKE

1353
00:40:36,502 --> 00:40:38,970
ENDS MEET OR BUY OUR OWN HOME?

1354
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:40,405
AM I JUST TOO YOUNG TO HANDLE

1355
00:40:40,405 --> 00:40:41,507
ALL OF THIS?

1356
00:40:41,507 --> 00:40:43,208
IT'S HARD TO TELL.

1357
00:40:43,208 --> 00:40:45,544
AS LONG AS THERE'S A HAPPY

1358
00:40:45,544 --> 00:40:47,546
FAMILY BEHIND HER, SHE SHOULD BE

1359
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:48,647
A GOOD PERSON WHEN SHE GROWS

1360
00:40:48,647 --> 00:40:49,915
OLDER, YOU KNOW.

1361
00:40:49,915 --> 00:40:51,116
I THINK WE'RE DOING PRETTY GOOD

1362
00:40:51,116 --> 00:40:51,817
SO FAR.

1363
00:40:51,817 --> 00:40:53,018
SO WE'LL SEE HOW THE FUTURE

1364
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:54,720
TURNS OUT.

1365
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,922
>> * I WOULD DO ANYTHING

1366
00:40:56,922 --> 00:41:00,191
* FOR HER

1367
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:01,026
AND THAT'S IT.

1368
00:41:01,026 --> 00:41:03,028
[laughs]

1369
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:09,167
>> I SAT YOU DOWN RIGHT HERE

1370
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:10,669
AND SAID, "USE PROTECTION.

1371
00:41:10,669 --> 00:41:11,537
I DON'T WANT TO BE A GRANDMA

1372
00:41:11,537 --> 00:41:12,170
YET."

1373
00:41:12,170 --> 00:41:12,838
>> MM-HMM.

1374
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:13,505
>> AND LOOK.

1375
00:41:13,505 --> 00:41:14,773
NOW I'M GONNA BE A GRANDMA.

1376
00:41:14,773 --> 00:41:15,774
>> ARE YOU GOING TO THE PROM?

1377
00:41:15,774 --> 00:41:16,542
>> I'M GONNA BE, LIKE,

1378
00:41:16,542 --> 00:41:17,108
THIS BIG.

1379

[laughter]

1380
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:19,578
I CAN'T FIT IN A DRESS.

>> IF HE HAD KEPT IT IN HIS

1382
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:21,580
PANTS, IT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN

1383
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:22,413
THIS WAY.

1384
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:23,248
>> PUSH, PUSH.

1385
00:41:23,248 --> 00:41:24,082
DON'T GIVE UP.

1386
00:41:24,082 --> 00:41:24,916
PUSH.

1387
00:41:24,916 --> 00:41:26,484
>> FATHERS AREN'T REALLY FATHERS

1388
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,352
UNTIL THEY HOLD THEIR BABY.

1389
00:41:27,352 --> 00:41:28,019
>> MAYBE.

1390
00:41:28,019 --> 00:41:28,854
>> YOU'RE HER FATHER,

1391
00:41:28,854 --> 00:41:29,855
AND YOU NEED TO ACT LIKE IT.

1392
00:41:29,855 --> 00:41:31,022
I'M JUST THE ONE THAT

1393
00:41:31,022 --> 00:41:32,390
GREW UP TOO FAST,

1394
00:41:32,390 --> 00:41:34,425
AND I WANT HIM TO GROW UP TOO.

1395
00:41:39,264 --> 00:41:40,265
