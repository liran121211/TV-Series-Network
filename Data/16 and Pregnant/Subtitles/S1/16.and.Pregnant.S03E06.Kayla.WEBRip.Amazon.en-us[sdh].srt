1
00:00:04,172 --> 00:00:06,040
>> HI, I'M KAYLA.

2
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,408
>> ALL RIGHT, KAYLA!

3
00:00:07,408 --> 00:00:08,576
>> OOH!

4
00:00:08,576 --> 00:00:11,312
>> I LIVE IN MANKATO, MINNESOTA.

5
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:12,380
I'M A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL,

6
00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:13,347
AND SPORTS HAVE ALWAYS BEEN

7
00:00:13,347 --> 00:00:14,215
MY LIFE.

8
00:00:14,215 --> 00:00:15,549
>> KAYLA!

9
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:16,450
>> I MET MY BEST FRIENDS

10
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:17,551
ON THE GYMNASTICS TEAM,

11
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:18,752
AND WE HANG OUT ALL THE TIME.

12
00:00:18,752 --> 00:00:19,653
WHOO!

13
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:21,155
I'M ALSO ON THE TRACK TEAM,

14
00:00:21,155 --> 00:00:22,022
AND THAT'S HOW I MET MY

15
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:22,990
BOYFRIEND, MIKE.

16
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:23,991
HE'S A YEAR OLDER THAN ME

17
00:00:23,991 --> 00:00:25,159
AND ALREADY GRADUATED FROM

18
00:00:25,159 --> 00:00:26,160
HIGH SCHOOL.

19
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,128
>> I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A KISS

20
00:00:27,128 --> 00:00:27,928
ON THE CHEEK TOO.

21
00:00:27,928 --> 00:00:28,529
>> MMM.

22
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,630
AND EVEN THOUGH HE WAS SHY AT

23
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:32,233
FIRST, I TOTALLY FELL FOR HIM.

24
00:00:32,233 --> 00:00:33,467
I KNEW YOU LIKED ME.

25
00:00:33,467 --> 00:00:34,435
I KNEW IT.

26
00:00:34,435 --> 00:00:35,936
HE LIVES AN HOUR AWAY,

27
00:00:35,936 --> 00:00:37,105
BUT WE'VE BEEN INSEPARABLE

28
00:00:37,105 --> 00:00:39,039
FOR TWO YEARS.

29
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,208
MY PARENTS ARE DIVORCED, AND

30
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,176
I HARDLY EVER TALK TO MY DAD.

31
00:00:42,176 --> 00:00:43,177
MY MOM AND I USED TO BE LIKE

32
00:00:43,177 --> 00:00:44,678
BEST FRIENDS, BUT RECENTLY,

33
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:46,347
I FEEL LIKE WE'RE GROWING APART.

34
00:00:46,347 --> 00:00:47,348
WE DON'T TALK, AND WE DON'T

35
00:00:47,348 --> 00:00:48,382
HANG OUT ANYMORE.

36
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:49,150
IT'S LONELY.

37
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:49,817
>> RIGHT.

38
00:00:49,817 --> 00:00:50,884
>> SHE'S BEEN SPENDING ALL HER

39
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:53,421
TIME WITH HER NEW BOYFRIEND.

40
00:00:53,421 --> 00:00:54,322
THINGS JUST HAVEN'T BEEN

41
00:00:54,322 --> 00:00:55,556
THE SAME BETWEEN US, AND I THINK

42
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:56,557
IT'S BECAUSE...

43
00:00:56,557 --> 00:00:57,291
[chime dings]

44
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:59,026
I'M PREGNANT.

45
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,701
I'M SIX-MONTHS PREGNANT,

46
00:01:07,701 --> 00:01:08,736
AND IT'S THE SUMMER BEFORE

47
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:09,770
SENIOR YEAR.

48
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:10,771
I'M TRYING TO MAKE THE MOST OF

49
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:11,839
IT BECAUSE I KNOW EVERYTHING

50
00:01:11,839 --> 00:01:13,274
WILL CHANGE ONCE I HAVE

51
00:01:13,274 --> 00:01:14,108
THE BABY.

52
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:15,909
[laughing] I CAN'T!

53
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:16,744
I CAN RUN,

54
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:18,746
BUT I'M AFRAID OF FALLING.

55
00:01:18,746 --> 00:01:19,913
>> SENIOR YEAR GYMNASTICS,

56
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:20,981
ARE YOU GONNA COME TO THE MEETS,

57
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:21,815
LIKE, WITH THE BABY?

58
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:22,550
>> NO.

59
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,217
>> WHY NOT?

60
00:01:23,217 --> 00:01:24,084
>> I DON'T WANT TO SEE

61
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:25,319
EVERYBODY.

62
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:26,487
IT'S GONNA BE SAD THAT I'LL BE

63
00:01:26,487 --> 00:01:27,488
MISSING OUT ON ALL THAT.

64
00:01:27,488 --> 00:01:29,157
BECAUSE, LIKE, GYMNASTICS,

65
00:01:29,157 --> 00:01:30,491
YOU MAKE SO MANY MEMORIES,

66
00:01:30,491 --> 00:01:31,659
AND THERE'S, LIKE, PICTURES

67
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:32,826
ALL THE TIME AND SLEEPOVERS

68
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:34,128
ALL THE TIME, AND THERE'S ALWAYS

69
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:35,095
STUFF GOING ON, AND I'M NOT

70
00:01:35,095 --> 00:01:36,029
GONNA BE ABLE TO BE A PART

71
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:36,730
OF ANY OF IT.

72
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:37,698
AND ALL OF YOU GUYS ARE ALL

73
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:38,499
GONNA BE TOGETHER.

74
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:39,433
>> IT'S GONNA BE DIFFERENT

75
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:40,334
WITHOUT YOU ON THE TEAM.

76
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:40,968
>> YEAH.

77
00:01:40,968 --> 00:01:42,002
>> YOU'RE THE ONE THAT KIND OF

78
00:01:42,002 --> 00:01:42,903
BROUGHT US ALL TOGETHER.

79
00:01:42,903 --> 00:01:44,037
>> I KNOW.

80
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,839
THE BABY IS RUINING EVERYTHING.

81
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:46,674
[laughs]

82
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:47,541
>> WELL, YOU KNOW THAT

83
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:48,509
YOU CAN ALWAYS CALL US,

84
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:49,410
AND WE'LL COME HELP YOU

85
00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,680
WITH ANYTHING.

86
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,114
>> I KEEP REALIZING HOW MUCH

87
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,849
I'M GOING TO BE MISSING OUT ON.

88
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:56,817
BUT AT LEAST MY FRIENDS HAVE

89
00:01:56,817 --> 00:01:59,853
BEEN REALLY SUPPORTIVE.

90
00:01:59,853 --> 00:02:01,189
>> SO HOW DID YOU FIGURE OUT

91
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:03,291
THAT YOU WERE PREGNANT?

92
00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:04,958
>> I WAS THROWING UP REALLY BAD,

93
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:06,126
AND I WAS CRABBY, AND I, LIKE,

94
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,628
TOLD MY MOM HOW SICK I WAS,

95
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:08,629
AND SHE, LIKE--SHE'S LIKE,

96
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:09,963
"OH, I NEED TO GET YOU

97
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:10,964
A PREGNANCY TEST."

98
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:12,800
AND I WAS LIKE, "NO, YOU DON'T,

99
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,335
MOM, STOP BEING DUMB."

100
00:02:14,335 --> 00:02:15,503
AND AS I WAS TAKING IT,

101
00:02:15,503 --> 00:02:16,370
I WAS YELLING AT HER.

102
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:17,505
I WAS LIKE, "THIS IS SO STUPID."

103
00:02:17,505 --> 00:02:18,839
AND THEN SHE LOOKS AT IT,

104
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:20,341
AND THEN, LIKE, I WAS PRETTY

105
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:21,675
SURE, LIKE, THE WORLD STOPPED

106
00:02:21,675 --> 00:02:22,376
FOR, LIKE...

107
00:02:22,376 --> 00:02:23,344
>> IT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

108
00:02:23,344 --> 00:02:24,278
>> I WASN'T SAD.

109
00:02:24,278 --> 00:02:25,045
I WASN'T MAD.

110
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:25,879
I WASN'T SURPRISED.

111
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:27,215
I WAS JUST, LIKE, DEAD.

112
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:28,916
LIKE, IT WAS SO WEIRD.

113
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,251
FINDING OUT I WAS PREGNANT WAS

114
00:02:30,251 --> 00:02:32,586
THE SCARIEST MOMENT OF MY LIFE.

115
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:34,087
WHAT MAKES IT EVEN WORSE

116
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:35,256
IS THAT I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH

117
00:02:35,256 --> 00:02:37,090
ANOREXIA WHEN I WAS 13 AND HAD

118
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:38,759
TO BE HOSPITALIZED, SO GAINING

119
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:39,927
ALL THIS WEIGHT IS REALLY HARD

120
00:02:39,927 --> 00:02:41,429
ON ME.

121
00:02:41,429 --> 00:02:43,063
LUCKILY, MY MOM LET MY

122
00:02:43,063 --> 00:02:44,398
BOYFRIEND, MIKE, MOVE IN,

123
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:45,733
SO HE COULD BE HERE TO SUPPORT

124
00:02:45,733 --> 00:02:46,934
ME AND THE BABY.

125
00:02:46,934 --> 00:02:48,135
>> REMEMBER WHEN WE FIRST MET?

126
00:02:48,135 --> 00:02:49,136
>> I THOUGHT YOU WERE KIND OF

127
00:02:49,136 --> 00:02:49,870
DOOFY LOOKING.

128
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:51,539
>> [laughs]

129
00:02:51,539 --> 00:02:52,706
HOW WAS I DOOFY LOOKING?

130
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:54,041
>> YOU WERE JUST KIND OF A DORK

131
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:55,376
AND, LIKE, TALL AND SKINNY

132
00:02:55,376 --> 00:02:56,076
AND AWKWARD.

133
00:02:56,076 --> 00:02:57,545
>> I'M NOT AWKWARD.

134
00:02:57,545 --> 00:02:58,346
>> YEAH, YOU WERE.

135
00:02:58,346 --> 00:02:59,313
YOU STILL ARE.

136
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:00,147
>> I AM NOT.

137
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:00,981
>> YES, YOU ARE.

138
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:01,715
>> NO, I'M NOT.

139
00:03:01,715 --> 00:03:02,750
>> WE WEREN'T DATING VERY LONG

140
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,318
BEFORE WE...

141
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:05,118
>> WE WHAT?

142
00:03:05,118 --> 00:03:05,986
>> DID IT.

143
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:07,321
>> IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

144
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:10,658
>> IT WAS ON YOUR 101 DALMATIAN 

145
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:12,159
BEDSHEETS AND YOUR YELLOW

146
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,494
CHILDREN'S BED.

147
00:03:13,494 --> 00:03:14,228
[laughs]

148
00:03:14,228 --> 00:03:15,195
>> THAT SQUEAKED EVERY TIME

149
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:15,863
YOU MOVED.

150
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,164
>> [laughs] IT DID SQUEAK!

151
00:03:17,164 --> 00:03:18,666
IT SQUEAKED SO MUCH.

152
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,167
>> SO GLAD I GOT RID OF THAT.

153
00:03:20,167 --> 00:03:22,002
>> NO, I THINK IT'S FUNNY.

154
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:24,004
>> THEN WE CAN WATCH JUNO. 

155
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:25,506
>> WE DID WATCH JUNO. 

156
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:26,640
[laughs]

157
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,641
I THINK THAT JINXED OUR WHOLE

158
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:28,342
RELATIONSHIP.

159
00:03:28,342 --> 00:03:29,142
[laughter]

160
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:30,110
I THINK THAT MOVIE WAS, LIKE,

161
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:30,944
AN OMEN.

162
00:03:30,944 --> 00:03:31,845
>> THAT'S KIND OF WEIRD.

163
00:03:31,845 --> 00:03:33,013
>> THAT IS WEIRD.

164
00:03:33,013 --> 00:03:34,014
YOU KNEW THAT I WASN'T ON

165
00:03:34,014 --> 00:03:35,015
BIRTH CONTROL WHEN WE DID IT

166
00:03:35,015 --> 00:03:36,350
ON YOUR BIRTHDAY.

167
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,318
I REMEMBER TELLING YOU

168
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:38,319
STRAIGHT OUT THAT I HADN'T

169
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,987
BEEN TAKING ANYTHING.

170
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:40,721
>> YEP.

171
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,723
>> THAT WAS SMART.

172
00:03:42,723 --> 00:03:45,225
>> VERY SMART.

173
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,560
>> GETTING PREGNANT CHANGES

174
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,728
EVERYTHING.

175
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:48,896
I ALWAYS DREAMED OF GOING OFF

176
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,598
TO COLLEGE TO BECOME A NURSE,

177
00:03:50,598 --> 00:03:51,532
AND NOW THAT'S GOING TO BE

178
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:53,100
A LOT HARDER, BUT AT LEAST

179
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,436
MIKE IS STANDING BY ME.

180
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:56,870
AND THE WHOLE THING HAS BEEN

181
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,739
REALLY DIFFICULT FOR MY MOM,

182
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,808
BECAUSE SHE WAS A TEEN MOM TOO,

183
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:01,809
AND I NEVER THOUGHT I'D REPEAT

184
00:04:01,809 --> 00:04:02,510
HER MISTAKE.

185
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:03,811
>> I WAS LIKE, "OH, MY GOSH.

186
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:06,146
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?"

187
00:04:06,146 --> 00:04:07,648
KIND OF SHOCKED.

188
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:09,350
>> THAT DAY WAS THE WORST.

189
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,384
>> AND I REMEMBER YOU GRABBING

190
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:11,352
YOUR HANDS AND PUTTING THEM

191
00:04:11,352 --> 00:04:12,219
OVER YOUR MOUTH AND--

192
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,153
>> THE FUNNY THING IS THAT

193
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:14,254
I DON'T THINK ANYBODY WILL EVER

194
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,524
BELIEVE ME; I WANTED TO LAUGH.

195
00:04:16,524 --> 00:04:17,691
I THINK THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

196
00:04:17,691 --> 00:04:18,859
WHY I COVERED UP MY MOUTH.

197
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:19,860
>> I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS FUNNY

198
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:22,863
AT ALL.

199
00:04:22,863 --> 00:04:25,032
>> WELL, THEN, LIKE, I WAS IN,

200
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:26,367
LIKE, A WHOLE DAZE, LIKE,

201
00:04:26,367 --> 00:04:27,167
THAT WHOLE NIGHT.

202
00:04:27,167 --> 00:04:28,068
LIKE, I LITERALLY BAWLED

203
00:04:28,068 --> 00:04:29,570
THE WHOLE NIGHT LONG.

204
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:30,604
>> YOU KNOW, YOU'RE GONNA GROW

205
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:32,373
UP A LOT ONCE THIS BABY COMES.

206
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:34,041
YOU'RE GONNA STRUGGLE.

207
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,676
YOU KNOW I HAVE.

208
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:36,677
>> I DON'T THINK I SHOULD BE

209
00:04:36,677 --> 00:04:37,845
ABLE TO BE A REGULAR TEENAGER.

210
00:04:37,845 --> 00:04:39,680
I'M NOT A REGULAR TEENAGER.

211
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,315
>> WHEN I FIRST FOUND OUT YOU

212
00:04:41,315 --> 00:04:42,350
WERE PREGNANT, WHEN WE FIRST SAW

213
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,151
THE TEST, MY BIGGEST FEAR

214
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:45,486
IS THAT YOU WOULDN'T KEEP IT.

215
00:04:45,486 --> 00:04:46,820
>> THAT WAS, LIKE, THE FIRST

216
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:47,821
THOUGHT THAT RAN THROUGH MY

217
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:49,990
MIND, BUT THEN WHEN YOU ACTUALLY

218
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,992
THINK ABOUT GETTING AN ABORTION,

219
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:54,495
LIKE, THIS COULD ALL BE GONE

220
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:56,997
IN A SECOND, IF I WANTED

221
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:58,499
EVERYTHING TO BE BACK TO NORMAL.

222
00:04:58,499 --> 00:04:59,467
I'LL NEVER EVEN HAVE TO TELL

223
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,168
ANYBODY, AND EVERYTHING WILL BE

224
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:01,835
JUST FINE.

225
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:02,836
I CAN JUST FORGET ABOUT IT.

226
00:05:02,836 --> 00:05:03,771
BUT THEN WHEN IT COMES TO

227
00:05:03,771 --> 00:05:04,705
ACTUALLY DOING IT, I COULD

228
00:05:04,705 --> 00:05:05,839
NEVER DO IT.

229
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:06,940
>> I NEVER THOUGHT YOU WOULD BE

230
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,108
PREGNANT.

231
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:10,143
YOU WERE, LIKE, SO DETERMINED,

232
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:11,244
SO I DIDN'T THINK IT WOULD EVER

233
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:12,480
BE YOU.

234
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:14,147
>> I KNOW.

235
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,483
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S BECAUSE

236
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:17,150
SHE'S SO DISAPPOINTED WITH ME,

237
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,652
BUT IT SEEMS LIKE MY MOM TAKES

238
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:19,987
OFF WITH HER BOYFRIEND, MIKE,

239
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,822
EVERY CHANCE SHE GETS, WHICH

240
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:23,156
REALLY SUCKS BECAUSE BEFORE

241
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:24,157
I GOT PREGNANT...

242
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:24,858
[chime dings]

243
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,860
WE DID EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

244
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:32,032
>> IS IT FUN TO LIVE WITH ME?

245
00:05:32,032 --> 00:05:33,967
>> [laughs] YES.

246
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:34,968
IF YOU WEREN'T HERE, NOBODY

247
00:05:34,968 --> 00:05:36,069
WOULD BE TALKING TO ME, AND I'D

248
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:37,037
BE SITTING HERE ALL LONELY,

249
00:05:37,037 --> 00:05:37,971
MAKING BROWNIES.

250
00:05:37,971 --> 00:05:39,272
>> AND TALKING TO MADDIE.

251
00:05:39,272 --> 00:05:41,108
>> AND TALKING TO THE CAT.

252
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:43,110
WELL, IT'S DEPRESSING.

253
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:43,944
>> A LITTLE BIT.

254
00:05:43,944 --> 00:05:44,945
>> DO MY ARMS FLAP, LIKE,

255
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:46,046
MOVING?

256
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:47,014
WHEN I DO THIS, DOES MY ARM

257
00:05:47,014 --> 00:05:47,881
JIGGLE FAT?

258
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:48,549
>> NO.

259
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:49,349
>> OR IS IT, LIKE,

260
00:05:49,349 --> 00:05:50,083
STILL MUSCULAR?

261
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,284
>> STILL MUSCULAR.

262
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,152
>> IT'S PRETTY RUNNY.

263
00:05:52,152 --> 00:05:53,286
I WHISKED IT REALLY WELL.

264
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:54,588
I'M SUCH A GOOD WHISKER.

265
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:55,589
>> A LOT TO SNACK ON.

266
00:05:55,589 --> 00:05:56,424
>> HUH?

267
00:05:56,424 --> 00:05:57,758
>> IT'S--NO.

268
00:05:57,758 --> 00:05:59,593
OF COURSE.

269
00:05:59,593 --> 00:06:00,394
>> MICHAEL, DON'T!

270
00:06:00,394 --> 00:06:01,562
DON'T, DON'T, DON'T, DON'T.

271
00:06:01,562 --> 00:06:02,229
>> WHY?

272
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,231
>> 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO.

273
00:06:04,231 --> 00:06:05,098
EW, YOU HAVE SOMETHING

274
00:06:05,098 --> 00:06:05,766
RIGHT HERE.

275
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:06,434
>> REALLY?

276
00:06:06,434 --> 00:06:07,067
>> YEAH.

277
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:09,236
>> I DIDN'T NOTICE.

278
00:06:13,407 --> 00:06:14,742
>> MIKE'S PARENTS WERE

279
00:06:14,742 --> 00:06:15,743
DISAPPOINTED THAT HE MOVED

280
00:06:15,743 --> 00:06:16,844
SO FAR AWAY...

281
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:18,846
>> I'M GONNA HEAD OFF TO WORK.

282
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:19,680
YEAH.

283
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,681
>> AND GAVE UP COLLEGE TO GET

284
00:06:20,681 --> 00:06:22,182
A PART-TIME JOB AT THE MALL.

285
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:23,350
BUT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT

286
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,518
WE HAVE TO START SAVING MONEY

287
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:27,855
FOR THE BABY.

288
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:29,022
WITH MIKE AT WORK,

289
00:06:29,022 --> 00:06:30,691
I'M HOME ALONE A LOT.

290
00:06:30,691 --> 00:06:31,859
I DON'T HAVE AN APPETITE,

291
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,026
AND I FEEL LIKE MY MOM HAS JUST

292
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,895
FORGOTTEN ABOUT ME.

293
00:06:34,895 --> 00:06:36,464
SO I'M GLAD THAT ME AND

294
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:37,465
MY FRIENDS HAVE A LOT OF

295
00:06:37,465 --> 00:06:38,932
SLEEPOVERS.

296
00:06:38,932 --> 00:06:39,933
I FEEL LIKE SHE DOESN'T THINK

297
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:40,934
SHE HAS ANY RESPONSIBILITIES,

298
00:06:40,934 --> 00:06:41,835
THAT SHE CAN DO WHATEVER

299
00:06:41,835 --> 00:06:42,503
SHE WANTS.

300
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:43,471
>> BECAUSE YOU'RE PREGNANT,

301
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:44,472
NOW SHE DOESN'T HAVE TO WATCH

302
00:06:44,472 --> 00:06:45,038
YOU.

303
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:45,706
>> EXACTLY.

304
00:06:45,706 --> 00:06:46,574
LIKE, SHE THINKS THAT

305
00:06:46,574 --> 00:06:47,541
I'M PREGNANT, AND I'M FINE,

306
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:48,476
AND I CAN BE ALL BY MYSELF

307
00:06:48,476 --> 00:06:49,176
ALL THE TIME.

308
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:49,977
>> WHY DO YOU THINK

309
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:50,711
SHE DOES THAT?

310
00:06:50,711 --> 00:06:51,812
>> I SERIOUSLY THINK SHE, LIKE,

311
00:06:51,812 --> 00:06:52,813
MENTALLY BLOCKS ME OUT IN HER

312
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:53,681
HEAD, AND SHE'S LIKE,

313
00:06:53,681 --> 00:06:55,749
"OH, CRAP."

314
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:56,850
>> WHY DO YOU ALWAYS COVER YOUR

315
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,751
BELLY UP WITH PILLOWS?

316
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,587
>> I HATE THE WAY, LIKE,

317
00:06:59,587 --> 00:07:01,421
IT FEELS, AND I FEEL FAT

318
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,756
ALL THE TIME.

319
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:03,857
>> SO, LIKE, EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE

320
00:07:03,857 --> 00:07:04,858
PREGNANT, DO YOU STILL--LIKE,

321
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:05,826
WHEN YOU LOOK IN THE MIRROR,

322
00:07:05,826 --> 00:07:06,794
DO YOU STILL SEE, LIKE, FAT

323
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:08,128
AND NOT A BABY?

324
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:09,463
>> YEAH, IT'S SO HARD FOR ME

325
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:11,131
BEING PREGNANT AND GAINING ALL

326
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:13,033
THIS WEIGHT WITHOUT ANY CONTROL.

327
00:07:13,033 --> 00:07:14,201
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW, WHEN I WAS 13,

328
00:07:14,201 --> 00:07:16,570
I WAS HOSPITALIZED FOR ANOREXIA.

329
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:17,237
>> MM-HMM.

330
00:07:17,237 --> 00:07:18,238
>> BUT THERE'S SO MANY TIMES

331
00:07:18,238 --> 00:07:19,406
WHERE, LIKE, I'LL JUST, LIKE,

332
00:07:19,406 --> 00:07:20,741
SKIP A MEAL, EVEN THOUGH

333
00:07:20,741 --> 00:07:22,576
YOU KNOW, "YOU HAVE A BABY

334
00:07:22,576 --> 00:07:23,410
YOU NEED TO FEED.

335
00:07:23,410 --> 00:07:25,245
DON'T BE STUPID."

336
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:26,179
BUT, LIKE, STILL SOMEWHERE

337
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,447
IN YOUR MIND IS TELLING YOU,

338
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,281
"DON'T GET FAT.

339
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:29,016
DON'T GET FAT.

340
00:07:29,016 --> 00:07:29,783
YOU'RE GROSS."

341
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:30,684
>> WELL, HAVE YOU TALKED

342
00:07:30,684 --> 00:07:31,785
TO YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT, LIKE,

343
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:34,287
PRENATAL DIETS?

344
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,288
>> YEAH, LIKE, I WAS TELLING

345
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:36,389
MY MOM HOW I WANT TO SEE, LIKE,

346
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:37,958
A DIETICIAN, WHO WILL, LIKE,

347
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,660
GIVE ME A MEAL PLAN.

348
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,761
LIKE, YOU AND YOUR MOM SIT DOWN

349
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:42,663
TO DINNER AT NIGHT, AND...

350
00:07:42,663 --> 00:07:43,396
I DON'T KNOW.

351
00:07:43,396 --> 00:07:45,365
I JUST--MY MOM DOESN'T EVEN TRY

352
00:07:45,365 --> 00:07:46,033
ANYMORE.

353
00:07:46,033 --> 00:07:46,934
SHE, LIKE, GAVE UP ON ME

354
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:50,070
OR SOMETHING.

355
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,572
BEING PREGNANT AND HAVING

356
00:07:51,572 --> 00:07:53,741
AN EATING DISORDER IS SO HARD,

357
00:07:53,741 --> 00:07:55,242
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE ONE PERSON

358
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:56,744
WHO HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR ME

359
00:07:56,744 --> 00:07:58,546
IS TOTALLY LETTING ME DOWN.

360
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:10,257
>> THERE'S JUST A FEW WEEKS LEFT

361
00:08:10,257 --> 00:08:11,692
OF SUMMER BREAK, AND MY MOM IS

362
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:12,626
AT HER BOYFRIEND'S HOUSE,

363
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:13,594
AS USUAL.

364
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:14,595
SO I'M GOING TO THE BEACH

365
00:08:14,595 --> 00:08:15,763
WITH MY FRIENDS, EVEN THOUGH

366
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:17,130
IT'S PRETTY EMBARRASSING TO HAVE

367
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,366
SUCH A BIG PREGNANT BELLY.

368
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:20,133
>> I'M SWEATING.

369
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:20,801
>> ME TOO.

370
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:21,635
>> I'M SWEATING TOO.

371
00:08:21,635 --> 00:08:22,536
YOU GUYS CAN GET IN YOUR

372
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:23,537
BATHING SUITS, IF YOU'D LIKE.

373
00:08:23,537 --> 00:08:24,471
>> WELL, YOU HAVE TO TOO.

374
00:08:24,471 --> 00:08:25,405
>> I'M NOT GOING TO.

375
00:08:25,405 --> 00:08:26,406
>> WHY NOT?

376
00:08:26,406 --> 00:08:27,174
>> I DON'T KNOW.

377
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:28,175
I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT, LIKE,

378
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:30,243
ALL OF THE WEIGHT I'VE GAINED.

379
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:31,411
NOT EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT

380
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:32,412
I'M PREGNANT, SO THEY JUST

381
00:08:32,412 --> 00:08:33,146
THINK I'M FAT.

382
00:08:33,146 --> 00:08:34,081
>> BUT IT'S VERY OBVIOUS,

383
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:35,415
'CAUSE YOU'RE ROUND.

384
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:37,751
YOU'RE NOT, LIKE, FLABBY.

385
00:08:37,751 --> 00:08:38,752
>> I'M KIND OF FLABBY.

386
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:39,653
[laughs]

387
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:40,487
>> IT'S BABY FLAB.

388
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:41,589
GET USED TO IT.

389
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:42,522
>> YOU'RE JUST SCARED OF,

390
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:43,390
LIKE, THE STARES THAT

391
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,191
YOU'RE GONNA GET?

392
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:44,825
>> YEAH.

393
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:45,793
EITHER THEY'LL STARE BECAUSE

394
00:08:45,793 --> 00:08:46,994
THEY'LL KNOW I'M PREGNANT

395
00:08:46,994 --> 00:08:48,228
IF I TAKE OFF MY SHIRT,

396
00:08:48,228 --> 00:08:50,397
OR THEY'LL STARE BECAUSE

397
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:52,265
I'M NASTY AND FAT.

398
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:53,066
>> YOU'RE NOT FAT.

399
00:08:53,066 --> 00:08:53,834
YOU'RE PREGNANT.

400
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:54,768
>> YEAH, BUT I DON'T NEED

401
00:08:54,768 --> 00:08:56,169
EVERYBODY LOOKING AT ME.

402
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:57,170
>> THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE

403
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,505
STARES, NO MATTER WHAT.

404
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,440
>> EXACTLY.

405
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,374
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT

406
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:02,109
MY FRIENDS SAY.

407
00:09:02,109 --> 00:09:03,210
I STILL FEEL FAT.

408
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:04,377
BUT GETTING BIGGER DOES MEAN

409
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,713
THAT I CAN FINALLY FIND OUT

410
00:09:05,713 --> 00:09:06,714
WHETHER WE'RE HAVING A BOY

411
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:07,881
OR A GIRL.

412
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:08,882
>> SO DO YOU HAVE A FEELING

413
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,383
OF WHAT YOU'RE HAVING?

414
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:12,352
>> WE ALL THINK IT'S A BOY,

415
00:09:12,352 --> 00:09:13,320
WHICH KIND OF MAKES ME THINK

416
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,422
IT'LL BE A GIRL, BUT I DON'T...

417
00:09:15,422 --> 00:09:18,325
>> THE BABY'S HEART.

418
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:20,661
ULTRASOUND IS NEVER 100%,

419
00:09:20,661 --> 00:09:22,996
BUT IT APPEARS TO BE A BOY.

420
00:09:22,996 --> 00:09:25,799
[laughter]

421
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:31,438
>> I'M EXCITED WE'RE HAVING

422
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:32,940
A BOY, AND NOW WE JUST HAVE

423
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,107
TO FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE GOING

424
00:09:34,107 --> 00:09:35,776
TO NAME HIM.

425
00:09:35,776 --> 00:09:37,778
COLBY, ASHTON, WARREN, PRESTON,

426
00:09:37,778 --> 00:09:39,312
TRENTON, AND CADEN.

427
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:40,413
I'M AFRAID IF WE CHOOSE ASHTON,

428
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,348
I'LL ONLY THINK OF ASHTON

429
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:41,982
KUTCHER.

430
00:09:41,982 --> 00:09:42,616
>> YEAH.

431
00:09:42,616 --> 00:09:45,285
>> BUT I REALLY LIKE THAT ONE.

432
00:09:45,285 --> 00:09:46,253
>> WHICH ONE SOUNDS BETTER?

433
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:47,254
>> PROBABLY PRESTON.

434
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:48,656
>> THAT'S A NICE NAME.

435
00:09:48,656 --> 00:09:49,990
>> IT'S CUTE.

436
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,258
>> WE HAVE OUR WINNER.

437
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,894
>> I THINK SO.

438
00:09:53,894 --> 00:09:55,328
>> I LIKE IT.

439
00:09:55,328 --> 00:09:57,665
COME HERE.

440
00:09:57,665 --> 00:09:58,966
>> WE NEED TO GET READY FOR

441
00:09:58,966 --> 00:10:00,567
THIS BABY, AND MY MOM HASN'T

442
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,102
GIVEN ME ANY ADVICE, BECAUSE

443
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:03,771
SHE'S ALWAYS WITH HER BOYFRIEND.

444
00:10:03,771 --> 00:10:05,272
SO IT SEEMS LIKE MIKE AND I

445
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,273
ARE ON OUR OWN.

446
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,275
WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT NURSERY

447
00:10:08,275 --> 00:10:10,110
STUFF, BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE

448
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:11,444
ANYTHING TO EVEN BEGIN TO SET UP

449
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:12,112
A ROOM.

450
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,446
>> I KNOW.

451
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,614
>> WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW

452
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:16,483
WE'RE GONNA PAY FOR THAT.

453
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:17,951
>> THAT'S JUST MATERIAL STUFF.

454
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:18,852
>> WELL, IT'S WHAT'S GOT

455
00:10:18,852 --> 00:10:19,519
TO BE DONE.

456
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,520
IT'S, LIKE, THE MOST IMPORTANT

457
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,121
THING.

458
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:22,222
LIKE, YOU SAY "MATERIAL STUFF,"

459
00:10:22,222 --> 00:10:23,190
BUT, WELL, IT NEEDS MATERIAL

460
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:23,791
STUFF.

461
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:24,725
IT'S GOT TO HAVE SOMETHING

462
00:10:24,725 --> 00:10:25,425
TO SLEEP IN.

463
00:10:25,425 --> 00:10:26,359
IT'S GOT TO HAVE SOMETHING

464
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:26,994
TO WEAR.

465
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:27,928
>> WHAT ARE YOU SO WORRIED

466
00:10:27,928 --> 00:10:28,495
ABOUT?

467
00:10:28,495 --> 00:10:30,297
>> THE REST OF MY LIFE.

468
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:31,298
AND EVERYTHING IS, LIKE,

469
00:10:31,298 --> 00:10:32,700
FALLING APART, AND NOBODY

470
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,634
IS TAKING IT SERIOUSLY BUT ME.

471
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,436
>> I'M HERE.

472
00:10:36,436 --> 00:10:37,437
>> YOU DON'T CARE,

473
00:10:37,437 --> 00:10:38,371
AND THEN MOM DOESN'T CARE.

474
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,440
>> HOW AM I--HOW DO I NOT CARE?

475
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,441
I MOVED DOWN HERE TO BE

476
00:10:41,441 --> 00:10:42,309
WITH YOU.

477
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,277
>> STOP TALKING.

478
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:45,178
>> WELL, IF YOU WANT ME

479
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:45,979
TO SHUT UP, I'LL...

480
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,280
>> NO, JUST DON'T BE STUPID,

481
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,448
MICHAEL.

482
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:49,750
>> KAYLA, THE BABY IS NOT GONNA

483
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,819
BE HERE FOR ANOTHER FOUR MONTHS.

484
00:10:51,819 --> 00:10:52,652
>> [scoffs]

485
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,486
SOONER THAN THAT.

486
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,056
AND THAT'S NOT THAT MUCH TIME.

487
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:57,057
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW

488
00:10:57,057 --> 00:10:59,226
TO MAKE MONEY AND SAVE MONEY

489
00:10:59,226 --> 00:11:00,728
AND BUY THINGS ALL IN THAT

490
00:11:00,728 --> 00:11:02,062
PERIOD OF TIME.

491
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:02,963
WE DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY

492
00:11:02,963 --> 00:11:03,596
SAVED UP.

493
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:04,531
WE HAVE NO MONEY TO SPEND

494
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:05,198
RIGHT NOW.

495
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:06,133
>> I KNOW THINGS ARE GONNA

496
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:07,567
GET HARD, BUT SOMEONE HAS TO

497
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:09,469
HAVE A POSITIVE OUTLOOK.

498
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:10,470
>> I'M NOT GONNA PRETEND LIKE

499
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:11,972
THINGS ARE FINE, AND IT'LL JUST

500
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:13,473
WORK OUT, AND WE COULDN'T EVEN

501
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:14,641
BUY A BAG OF DIAPERS RIGHT NOW

502
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:15,809
IF WE WANTED TO.

503
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:16,810
>> SO DO YOU WANT TO GO

504
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,346
AND MAYBE LOOK AT STUFF?

505
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,749
>> WHEN WE CAN'T BUY THEM?

506
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:23,917
>> JUST TO PRICE STUFF OUT,

507
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:25,418
HOW MUCH WE'D HAVE TO SAVE,

508
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:27,554
HOW MUCH WE'D HAVE TO SPEND.

509
00:11:27,554 --> 00:11:31,892
>> SURE.

510
00:11:31,892 --> 00:11:33,226
I'M GLAD MIKE WANTS THINGS

511
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:34,561
TO WORK OUT, BUT I DON'T THINK

512
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:36,063
HE REALIZES HOW EXPENSIVE

513
00:11:36,063 --> 00:11:37,898
THIS IS GOING TO BE.

514
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:38,766
I JUST DON'T EVEN KNOW

515
00:11:38,766 --> 00:11:40,901
WHAT WE, LIKE--WE ALL NEED.

516
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:41,835
>> SO THIS IS, LIKE, WHAT?

517
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:42,569
A BOUNCER?

518
00:11:42,569 --> 00:11:43,570
>> I DON'T KNOW.

519
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,872
>> I DON'T KNOW EITHER.

520
00:11:44,872 --> 00:11:45,873
>> THIS IS WHAT YOU NEED

521
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:46,840
WHEN THEY'RE REALLY LITTLE,

522
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,640
I THINK.

523
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,842
HOW MUCH ARE THEY?

524
00:11:48,842 --> 00:11:49,509
>> $45.

525
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:50,443
>> $45.

526
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,411
>> BUT AREN'T THEY GONNA BE

527
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:52,612
IN IT FOR, LIKE, NOT THAT LONG?

528
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:53,947
>> YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

529
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:54,948
DO YOU KNOW HOW OLD THEY ARE

530
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:56,149
WHEN THEY SIT IN HIGH CHAIRS?

531
00:11:56,149 --> 00:11:57,150
>> I DON'T KNOW, BUT THEY HAVE

532
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,318
TO, LIKE, BE ABLE TO HOLD

533
00:11:58,318 --> 00:11:59,486
THEMSELVES UP AND...

534
00:11:59,486 --> 00:12:00,487
>> WELL, YEAH, OTHERWISE,

535
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:01,755
THEY'D BE FALLING OVER.

536
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:03,891
IT'S HARD TO MAKE A PLAN

537
00:12:03,891 --> 00:12:06,126
WHEN EVERYTHING IS SO EXPENSIVE,

538
00:12:06,126 --> 00:12:07,094
AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT

539
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:07,961
WE NEED.

540
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:09,462
>> HOW MANY DIAPERS DO YOU THINK

541
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:10,864
BABIES GO THROUGH?

542
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:11,865
>> I DON'T KNOW.

543
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:13,366
SO I TEXTED MY MOM THAT I NEED

544
00:12:13,366 --> 00:12:14,701
HER HELP, AND SHE AGREED TO

545
00:12:14,701 --> 00:12:16,436
MEET ME FOR DINNER.

546
00:12:16,436 --> 00:12:18,305
WE WENT TO STORES TODAY,

547
00:12:18,305 --> 00:12:19,406
'CAUSE WE NEED TO START SETTING

548
00:12:19,406 --> 00:12:20,273
UP THE NURSERY.

549
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:21,308
>> MM-HMM.

550
00:12:21,308 --> 00:12:22,242
>> THERE'S SO MANY THINGS

551
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,076
I HAD NO IDEA, LIKE,

552
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:23,811
WE EVEN NEEDED.

553
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:24,511
I DON'T KNOW.

554
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:25,412
IT WAS WEIRD AND KIND OF

555
00:12:25,412 --> 00:12:26,346
OVERWHELMING.

556
00:12:26,346 --> 00:12:27,514
LIKE, EVEN THOUGH MIKE IS THERE,

557
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:28,681
MIKE'S NOT A MOM

558
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:29,850
OR EXPECTING MOM.

559
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:30,617
HE DOESN'T KNOW.

560
00:12:30,617 --> 00:12:31,618
>> HAVE YOU EVER THOUGHT ABOUT

561
00:12:31,618 --> 00:12:33,053
GETTING INTO A GROUP TO SUPPORT

562
00:12:33,053 --> 00:12:34,387
YOUNG MOMS?

563
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:35,488
>> I JUST WISH, LIKE, YOU WOULD

564
00:12:35,488 --> 00:12:37,057
JUST SIT DOWN WITH ME AND, LIKE,

565
00:12:37,057 --> 00:12:38,058
TALK ABOUT STUFF WITH ME.

566
00:12:38,058 --> 00:12:39,559
LIKE, ME AND MIKE, WE HAVE NO

567
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,661
IDEA WHAT WE NEED FOR THE BABY.

568
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:42,662
>> I THINK IT'S ALL GONNA FALL

569
00:12:42,662 --> 00:12:44,031
INTO PLACE.

570
00:12:44,031 --> 00:12:44,965
>> I FEEL LIKE THINGS NEED

571
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:45,999
TO BE PLANNED.

572
00:12:45,999 --> 00:12:46,900
>> SOMETHING LIKE THIS,

573
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,536
YOU CAN'T PLAN.

574
00:12:49,536 --> 00:12:51,704
>> DO YOU THINK YOU'LL BE--

575
00:12:51,704 --> 00:12:53,306
YOU'LL TRY TO BE AROUND MORE

576
00:12:53,306 --> 00:12:54,641
WHEN THE BABY IS HERE?

577
00:12:54,641 --> 00:12:56,143
AND, LIKE...

578
00:12:56,143 --> 00:12:57,477
>> ABSOLUTELY.

579
00:12:57,477 --> 00:12:59,312
>> WELL...

580
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:00,981
THEN HOW COME, LIKE,

581
00:13:00,981 --> 00:13:03,817
YOU'RE NOT NOW?

582
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:04,918
SOMETIMES IT WOULD JUST BE NICE

583
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:05,685
JUST TO SIT DOWN

584
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:07,387
AND TALK TO YOU.

585
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:08,388
>> I'LL MAKE A POINT TO BE

586
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,723
THERE FOR YOU MORE.

587
00:13:10,723 --> 00:13:11,959
I WILL.

588
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:14,661
>> OKAY.

589
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:16,496
I HOPE MY MOM KEEPS HER WORD

590
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:17,965
BECAUSE I NEED HER NOW MORE

591
00:13:17,965 --> 00:13:19,766
THAN EVER.

592
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:30,944
>> EVEN THOUGH THINGS WITH

593
00:13:30,944 --> 00:13:31,879
MY MOM HAVE BEEN TOUGH,

594
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:32,880
AT LEAST MY FRIENDS HAVEN'T

595
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,680
CHANGED.

596
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,182
SINCE SCHOOL STARTS IN TWO

597
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:36,183
WEEKS, THERE'S STILL PLENTY

598
00:13:36,183 --> 00:13:37,350
OF TIME TO HANG OUT.

599
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:38,685
SO TONIGHT, THEY'RE COMING OVER

600
00:13:38,685 --> 00:13:40,153
FOR A SLEEPOVER.

601
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,322
>> MOMMY!

602
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:43,690
HOW YOU DOING?

603
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,325
>> AH, GOOD.

604
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:46,059
>> LET'S PLAY.

605
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:46,726
YOU READY?

606
00:13:46,726 --> 00:13:47,627
>> IF I GET TOO EXCITED,

607
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:48,328
I GUESS THEM.

608
00:13:48,328 --> 00:13:48,996
[laughter]

609
00:13:48,996 --> 00:13:49,997
>> OKAY, UM, THE TWO PEOPLE--

610
00:13:49,997 --> 00:13:50,931
FIRST PEOPLE ON THE PLANET

611
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:52,132
THAT ATE THE BAD APPLE.

612
00:13:52,132 --> 00:13:53,133
>> WHAT?

613
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:54,134
>> GOD'S PEOPLE!

614
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:55,302
[laughter]

615
00:13:55,302 --> 00:13:56,236
>> OH, MY GOD, OH, MY GOD.

616
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:57,004
>> ADAM AND EVE.

617
00:13:57,004 --> 00:13:58,405
>> OH!

618
00:13:58,405 --> 00:13:59,606
>> YOU COOK IN A...

619
00:13:59,606 --> 00:14:00,273
>> PAN.

620
00:14:00,273 --> 00:14:00,941
>> YEAH.

621
00:14:00,941 --> 00:14:01,608
>> AHH!

622
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:02,976
[all talking at once]

623
00:14:02,976 --> 00:14:04,044
>> IF YOU'RE NOT IN THE COUNTRY,

624
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:06,146
YOU'RE IN THE...

625
00:14:06,146 --> 00:14:06,980
>> OCEAN?

626
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,148
>> YEAH, OCEAN.

627
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:09,516
>> NO, CITY!

628
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:10,350
>> OH!

629
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:11,551
>> OKAY--

630
00:14:11,551 --> 00:14:12,219
buzz!

631
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:12,920
>> WHOO!

632
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,586
[laughs]

633
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:14,454
OKAY, LET'S GO SET UP

634
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:15,923
WHERE WE'RE SLEEPING TONIGHT.

635
00:14:15,923 --> 00:14:16,723
>> OKAY.

636
00:14:16,723 --> 00:14:17,524
>> ARE YOU THERE?

637
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:18,325
ARE YOU HOLDING IT?

638
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:18,992
OH, MY GOD!

639
00:14:18,992 --> 00:14:19,659
>> I GOT IT.

640
00:14:19,659 --> 00:14:20,493
>> I CAN'T DO THAT!

641
00:14:20,493 --> 00:14:21,461
>> WHY ARE YOU FREAKING OUT?

642
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:22,495
>> WELL, 'CAUSE I WASN'T GONNA

643
00:14:22,495 --> 00:14:23,496
LET YOU, LIKE...

644
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:24,497
>> WHERE IS THE BABY GONNA GO

645
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:25,465
WHEN YOU'RE GOING TO SCHOOL?

646
00:14:25,465 --> 00:14:26,233
>> I DON'T KNOW.

647
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:27,234
LIKE, ME AND MIKE HAVE TO WORK

648
00:14:27,234 --> 00:14:28,235
SOMETHING OUT, BECAUSE DON'T

649
00:14:28,235 --> 00:14:29,402
THEY HAVE, LIKE, RULES?

650
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,570
YOU CAN'T PUT A BABY IN DAY CARE

651
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,905
FOR, LIKE, SIX WEEKS.

652
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:32,906
SO I CAN'T STAY HOME FROM

653
00:14:32,906 --> 00:14:34,574
HIGH SCHOOL FOR SIX WEEKS.

654
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:36,109
I WOULD, LIKE, NEVER CATCH UP.

655
00:14:36,109 --> 00:14:36,776
>> YEAH.

656
00:14:36,776 --> 00:14:37,777
>> SO THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO

657
00:14:37,777 --> 00:14:38,878
FIGURE OUT, IS THAT TIME PERIOD.

658
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:39,913
'CAUSE, LIKE, I WANT TO GET BACK

659
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:41,014
INTO HIGH SCHOOL, LIKE, JUST AS

660
00:14:41,014 --> 00:14:42,049
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AFTER I HAVE

661
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:42,682
THE BABY.

662
00:14:42,682 --> 00:14:44,017
I THINK THAT'LL BE HARD.

663
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:44,985
>> ARE YOU STILL GONNA WALK

664
00:14:44,985 --> 00:14:46,853
WITH US ON GRADUATION DAY?

665
00:14:46,853 --> 00:14:48,121
>> I WANT TO.

666
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:49,622
I REALLY WANT TO GRADUATE,

667
00:14:49,622 --> 00:14:50,790
AND THE ONLY WAY IT'S GOING

668
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,292
TO HAPPEN IS IF MIKE AND MY MOM

669
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:53,793
WATCH THE BABY WHEN I GO BACK

670
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:55,128
TO SCHOOL.

671
00:14:55,128 --> 00:14:56,463
I'M GOING TO HAVE HIM IN THREE

672
00:14:56,463 --> 00:14:57,630
MONTHS, WHICH IS IN THE MIDDLE

673
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:59,299
OF THE SCHOOL YEAR, SO I KNOW

674
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:01,434
IT'LL BE REALLY HARD TO KEEP UP.

675
00:15:05,805 --> 00:15:06,706
>> ARE YOU GONNA BE ABLE

676
00:15:06,706 --> 00:15:07,640
TO HOLD THAT UNTIL I CAN--

677
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,541
>> MOM, IT DOESN'T FIT.

678
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,276
IT'S TOO BIG.

679
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:10,377
>> THESE SIDES MOVE IN.

680
00:15:10,377 --> 00:15:11,044
>> OH.

681
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:15,382
[laughter]

682
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:16,616
IT SEEMS LIKE MY MOM IS GOING

683
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:18,618
TO KEEP HER WORD AND SPEND MORE

684
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:21,221
TIME AT HOME WITH ME AND MIKE.

685
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:22,222
ARE YOU GONNA BE ABLE TO TAKE

686
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:24,891
A VACATION WHEN THE BABY COMES?

687
00:15:24,891 --> 00:15:26,059
>> I'LL BE TAKING SOME TIME OFF,

688
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:26,893
YES.

689
00:15:26,893 --> 00:15:27,894
>> BECAUSE, LIKE, I ONLY WANT

690
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:29,396
TO MISS, LIKE, A WEEK OF SCHOOL.

691
00:15:29,396 --> 00:15:30,363
>> I THINK YOU'RE GONNA WANT

692
00:15:30,363 --> 00:15:31,298
MORE TIME, DEFINITELY NEED

693
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:32,532
MORE TIME THAN A WEEK.

694
00:15:32,532 --> 00:15:33,866
ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT GOING BACK

695
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,702
TO SCHOOL LOOKING HEAVY?

696
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:36,736
>> IT'S JUST LIKE--IT SEEMS LIKE

697
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:37,937
IT'S IRREVERSIBLE.

698
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,106
LIKE, EVERY POUND I PUT ON,

699
00:15:39,106 --> 00:15:40,773
I'M, LIKE, UGH, I CAN'T GET RID

700
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,774
OF THAT NOW.

701
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:42,642
>> JUST REMEMBER THAT

702
00:15:42,642 --> 00:15:45,045
THAT BABY IS ASKING FOR SO MUCH.

703
00:15:45,045 --> 00:15:46,146
>> BUT I FEEL LIKE I'VE ALREADY

704
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:47,547
GAINED 12 POUNDS, AND I'M JUST,

705
00:15:47,547 --> 00:15:48,381
LIKE...

706
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:49,716
>> AT SIX MONTHS PREGNANT,

707
00:15:49,716 --> 00:15:50,450
THOUGH, KAYLA?

708
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,418
>> YEAH, BUT I'M ONLY 2/3 OF

709
00:15:51,418 --> 00:15:52,519
THE WAY THERE, AND YOU GAIN ALL

710
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:53,520
THE WEIGHT IN THAT LAST, LIKE,

711
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,954
COUPLE MONTHS.

712
00:15:54,954 --> 00:15:55,888
>> A LOT OF THAT IS WATER

713
00:15:55,888 --> 00:15:56,789
WEIGHT, YOU KNOW?

714
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,125
>> BUT I WAS, LIKE, READING MY

715
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,626
PREGNANCY BOOK: 1 TO 2 POUNDS

716
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:00,293
A WEEK.

717
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:01,294
AND, LIKE, 2 POUNDS A WEEK

718
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,462
FROM HERE ON OUT, DO YOU KNOW

719
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,397
HOW BIG THAT'S GONNA MAKE ME?

720
00:16:04,397 --> 00:16:05,365
>> DO YOU EVER JUST STAND IN

721
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:06,633
THE MIRROR AND LOOK AT YOURSELF?

722
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:07,467
>> I CRY.

723
00:16:07,467 --> 00:16:08,468
I CRY BEFORE AND AFTER

724
00:16:08,468 --> 00:16:09,136
MY SHOWERS.

725
00:16:09,136 --> 00:16:10,137
LIKE, THAT'S NOT EVEN A JOKE

726
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:10,737
AT ALL.

727
00:16:10,737 --> 00:16:11,504
MIKE KNOWS THIS.

728
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:12,472
I SIT THERE, AND I STARE AT

729
00:16:12,472 --> 00:16:13,273
MYSELF, AND I CRY.

730
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:14,274
I HATE IT SO MUCH.

731
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:15,142
>> DO YOU JUST LOOK AT

732
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:16,109
YOUR STOMACH, OR DO YOU LOOK

733
00:16:16,109 --> 00:16:16,843
AT EVERYTHING?

734
00:16:16,843 --> 00:16:17,744
>> I LOOK AT MY STOMACH

735
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:19,012
AND MY STRETCH MARKS AND MY--

736
00:16:19,012 --> 00:16:22,182
>> YOU HAVE STRETCH MARKS?

737
00:16:22,182 --> 00:16:23,183
>> IS IT POSSIBLE TO, LIKE,

738
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:25,685
LOSE WEIGHT DURING PREGNANCY

739
00:16:25,685 --> 00:16:27,220
AND IT BE OKAY?

740
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,155
>> I WOULDN'T THINK LOSING

741
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:29,556
WEIGHT DURING A PREGNANCY

742
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:31,891
WOULD BE HEALTHY AT ALL.

743
00:16:31,891 --> 00:16:32,859
>> I'M GLAD MY MOM'S AROUND,

744
00:16:32,859 --> 00:16:34,194
ESPECIALLY SINCE I'M FEELING

745
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:36,029
SO INSECURE ABOUT MY BODY,

746
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:37,530
AND SHE'S THE ONLY ONE I CAN

747
00:16:37,530 --> 00:16:40,333
REALLY TALK TO ABOUT IT.

748
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:41,168
>> I LOVE YOU.

749
00:16:41,168 --> 00:16:43,170
>> I LOVE YOU TOO.

750
00:16:43,170 --> 00:16:44,504
TONIGHT, MIKE IS VISITING HIS

751
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:45,838
PARENTS, BECAUSE MY MOM WANTS

752
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:49,242
TO HAVE A GIRLS' NIGHT OUT.

753
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:51,978
>> OUR PLANS CHANGED.

754
00:16:51,978 --> 00:16:52,879
ME AND MIKE ARE GONNA GO

755
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,481
TO THE TWINS GAME, 'CAUSE MATT

756
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:57,984
GOT TWO EXTRA TICKETS, BUT--

757
00:16:57,984 --> 00:16:58,851
>> TWO EXTRA TICKETS,

758
00:16:58,851 --> 00:16:59,686
AND I'M NOT INVITED.

759
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,454
>> GENERAL SEATING.

760
00:17:01,454 --> 00:17:02,389
>> WELL, WHY CAN'T I GO TO

761
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:03,290
THE TWINS GAME AND YOUR

762
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:04,291
BOYFRIEND STAY HOME?

763
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,292
>> WELL, THE TICKETS WERE

764
00:17:05,292 --> 00:17:06,126
GIVEN TO US.

765
00:17:06,126 --> 00:17:07,294
IT WASN'T LIKE WE BOUGHT THEM.

766
00:17:07,294 --> 00:17:08,295
>> YEAH, BUT I'M SURE YOU HAD

767
00:17:08,295 --> 00:17:10,930
A CHOICE OF WHO YOU COULD BRING.

768
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,133
>> OKAY.

769
00:17:32,085 --> 00:17:32,919
>> HELLO?

>> HEY.

771
00:17:34,087 --> 00:17:38,125
SO I AM AT HOME BY MYSELF.

772
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:39,159
>> YOUR MOM LEFT YOU?

773
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:40,193
>> YEAH, SHE WENT TO

774
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:41,194
A TWINS GAME.

775
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:42,529
>> OHH!

776
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:44,131
WANT TO HANG OUT TONIGHT?

777
00:17:44,131 --> 00:17:46,199
>> SURE, YOU SHOULD COME GET ME.

778
00:17:46,199 --> 00:17:47,033
>> I WILL.

779
00:17:47,033 --> 00:17:48,034
I'LL BE THERE IN A LITTLE BIT.

780
00:17:48,034 --> 00:17:49,569
>> BYE.

781
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,971
THANK GOD FOR MY FRIENDS.

782
00:17:51,971 --> 00:17:52,872
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO

783
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,574
WITHOUT THEM.

784
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,579
>> KAYLA?

785
00:17:59,579 --> 00:18:01,013
HI, HONEY.

786
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:03,183
>> I'M ALMOST READY.

787
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,154
I JUST WISH SHE WOULD LOOK AT

788
00:18:07,154 --> 00:18:10,757
HERSELF AND SEE, "OH, GEE,

789
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:11,758
THERE'S A REASON MY DAUGHTER

790
00:18:11,758 --> 00:18:12,459
IS UNHAPPY."

791
00:18:12,459 --> 00:18:13,126
>> YEAH.

792
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:14,060
>> BUT SHE DOESN'T SEE IT

793
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:14,694
THAT WAY.

794
00:18:14,694 --> 00:18:15,595
>> HAS SHE EVEN ADMITTED

795
00:18:15,595 --> 00:18:17,230
TO, LIKE, NOT BEING THERE

796
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:17,964
FOR YOU?

797
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:18,798
>> SHE GOES, "I KNOW.

798
00:18:18,798 --> 00:18:19,566
I'LL TRY HARDER."

799
00:18:19,566 --> 00:18:20,467
SHE'S LIKE, "WE ALL NEED

800
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:21,201
TO FIX THINGS.

801
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:22,034
NOBODY IS PERFECT."

802
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,636
I'M LIKE, "OKAY, THEN FIX THEM."

803
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:24,304
>> YEAH.

804
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:25,372
>> LIKE, I AT LEAST EXPECTED HER

805
00:18:25,372 --> 00:18:26,306
TO BE FAKE ENOUGH TO STICK

806
00:18:26,306 --> 00:18:27,807
AROUND, YOU KNOW?

807
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,142
BUT SHE DOESN'T EVEN--

808
00:18:29,142 --> 00:18:30,109
LIKE, SHE DIDN'T EVEN OWE ME

809
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,077
THAT APPARENTLY, 'CAUSE SHE

810
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:33,180
JUST LEFT.

811
00:18:36,015 --> 00:18:37,184
MY MOM BREAKING OUR PLANS

812
00:18:37,184 --> 00:18:39,018
REALLY HURTS ME, AND THE MORE

813
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:40,353
I THINK ABOUT IT, THE MORE

814
00:18:40,353 --> 00:18:41,521
I REALIZE I HAVE TO LET HER

815
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:42,755
KNOW.

816
00:18:42,755 --> 00:18:43,756
>> HELLO?

817
00:18:43,756 --> 00:18:44,791
>> HEY.

818
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:46,092
>> HEY.

819
00:18:46,092 --> 00:18:47,927
>> UM, WELL, FIRST OF ALL,

820
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:49,596
I GUESS I KIND OF WANT TO SAY

821
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:50,763
I FEEL LIKE YOUR BOYFRIEND CAME

822
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:51,764
BEFORE ME.

823
00:18:51,764 --> 00:18:53,266
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT.

824
00:18:53,266 --> 00:18:54,434
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,

825
00:18:54,434 --> 00:18:55,935
I FIGURE, WELL, YOU'VE GOT MIKE.

826
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:56,903
YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE

827
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:58,104
TO RELY ON ME TO BE AT HOME

828
00:18:58,104 --> 00:18:59,739
ALL THE TIME ANYMORE.

829
00:18:59,739 --> 00:19:00,673
>> BUT I FEEL LIKE WHETHER

830
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:01,808
OR NOT I'M PREGNANT, I'M STILL

831
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:02,942
17 YEARS OLD, AND I'M STILL

832
00:19:02,942 --> 00:19:04,110
YOUR DAUGHTER, AND I STILL WANT

833
00:19:04,110 --> 00:19:05,812
YOU TO BE A MOM TO ME.

834
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:06,679
>> BUT I ALSO WANT YOU

835
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:07,614
TO UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVE

836
00:19:07,614 --> 00:19:08,281
A LIFE TOO.

837
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:09,649
AND AT 17 YEARS OLD, YOU DO NOT

838
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,818
HAVE TO BE OCCUPIED BY YOUR MOM

839
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:13,286

WE'RE JUST ROOMMATES WHO LIVE

843
00:19:16,223 --> 00:19:17,190
IN THE SAME HOUSE AND IGNORE

844
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:17,857
EACH OTHER.

845

WE DON'T EVEN HAVE

846
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:19,759
A RELATIONSHIP ANYMORE.

WE DON'T TALK TO EACH OTHER

848
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,262
LIKE WE USED TO.

849

>> WELL, MAYBE THERE ARE SOME

850
00:19:23,596 --> 00:19:24,597
THINGS ON BOTH OF OUR PARTS

851
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,399
THAT NEED TO CHANGE.

852
00:19:26,399 --> 00:19:27,234
>> SERIOUSLY, I FELT

853
00:19:27,234 --> 00:19:28,868
SO LEFT OUT.

VACATION, AND MY MOM HAS BEEN

858
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:54,394
EVEN MORE DISTANT SINCE WE

859
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:56,195
TALKED.

WOULD DO?

867
00:20:06,273 --> 00:20:07,474
>> NO, PROBABLY NOT.

868
00:20:07,474 --> 00:20:08,475
SHE IS REALLY GOOD AT MAKING

869
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:09,442

00:21:58,117 --> 00:22:00,620
WANT TO MAKE A BELLY CAST.

935
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,488
I FEEL LIKE I'M, LIKE,

936
00:22:01,488 --> 00:22:02,455
FULL TERM; I'M GONNA POP.

937
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:03,289
>> I THINK WE SHOULD

938
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:04,557
PAPIER-MACHE YOUR BELLY

939
00:22:04,557 --> 00:22:05,358
BEFORE YOU GET HUGE

940
00:22:05,358 --> 00:22:06,559
AND THEN FOR THE BABY SHOWER.

941
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:07,494
>> YOU LOOK LIKE YOU HAVE

942
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:08,495
A BASKETBALL SHOVED UNDERNEATH

943
00:22:08,495 --> 00:22:09,396
YOUR TANK.

944
00:22:09,396 --> 00:22:10,363
LIKE, THAT--SERIOUSLY.

945
00:22:10,363 --> 00:22:11,464
LIKE, YOU DON'T--YOU'RE NOT,

946
00:22:11,464 --> 00:22:13,132
LIKE, PREGNANT ANYWHERE ELSE.

947
00:22:13,132 --> 00:22:15,067
OKAY, FLOUR, THE WATER...

948
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:15,902
>> TWO PARTS FLOUR,

949
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:17,804
ONE PART WATER.

950
00:22:17,804 --> 00:22:18,771
>> THAT'S OKAY.

951
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:20,006
WAS THAT 2 CUPS?

952
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:20,707
>> KIND OF.

953
00:22:20,707 --> 00:22:21,908
>> OKAY, SO YOU NEED 2 MORE.

954
00:22:21,908 --> 00:22:23,342
KIND OF?

955
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:24,343
>> YOU NEED TO TAKE THIS OFF.

956
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:25,111
>> I'M GOING TO.

957
00:22:25,111 --> 00:22:26,345
I JUST DON'T--IT'S COLD IN HERE.

958
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,714
>> DO YOU FEEL WEIRD,

959
00:22:27,714 --> 00:22:29,081
BEING ALL EXPOSED?

960
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:29,916
>> I'M FAT.

961
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:31,250
>> YOU'RE VERY SELF-CONSCIOUS

962
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,585
ABOUT YOUR SIDES, BECAUSE YOU

963
00:22:32,585 --> 00:22:33,553
THINK YOU HAVE MUFFIN-TOPS

964
00:22:33,553 --> 00:22:34,687
AND YOU HAVE STRETCH MARKS.

965
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:35,388
>> YOU DON'T.

966
00:22:35,388 --> 00:22:36,355
>> YOU DON'T--OKAY, YOU DO,

967
00:22:36,355 --> 00:22:37,424
BUT THEY'RE--EVERY PREGNANT GIRL

968
00:22:37,424 --> 00:22:38,391
IS GONNA GET STRETCH MARKS.

969
00:22:38,391 --> 00:22:39,426
>> OH, MY GOD, NO.

970
00:22:39,426 --> 00:22:40,593
ONLY, LIKE, HALF PREGNANT PEOPLE

971
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:41,428
GET STRETCH MARKS.

972
00:22:41,428 --> 00:22:42,261
THE OTHER HALF--

973
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:43,195
>> WELL, YOU'RE ONE OF THE

974
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,897
LUCKY HALFS.

975
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,001
>> CAN I SIT NOW?

976
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:49,869
>> NO.

977
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:51,037
>> MY FEET HURT, YOU GUYS.

978
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:51,871
I'M NOT STANDING UP

979
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:53,172
THIS WHOLE TIME.

980
00:22:53,172 --> 00:22:53,973
>> IF IT'S RUINED,

981
00:22:53,973 --> 00:22:55,307
IT'S YOUR FAULT.

982
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:55,975
>> ME?

983
00:22:55,975 --> 00:22:56,976
I DON'T REALLY CARE

984
00:22:56,976 --> 00:22:58,778
AT THIS POINT.

985
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:04,050
I FEEL REALLY LIGHT-HEADED.

986
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:06,018
WE NEED TO STOP.

987
00:23:06,018 --> 00:23:07,119
>> DO YOU NEED FOOD?

988
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:07,920
>> UM, I CAN'T SEE.

989
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,821
>> YOU'RE PROBABLY HOT,

990
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:09,589
'CAUSE I'M HOT.

991
00:23:09,589 --> 00:23:10,957
>> NO, I'M SERIOUSLY SCARED.

992
00:23:10,957 --> 00:23:12,124
>> YOU WANT SOME WATER?

993
00:23:12,124 --> 00:23:12,792
FOR REAL?

994
00:23:12,792 --> 00:23:13,760
>> THERE'S A BOTTLE OF WATER

995
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:14,494
IN THE FRIDGE.

996
00:23:14,494 --> 00:23:15,127
>> OKAY.

997
00:23:15,127 --> 00:23:16,095
YOU WANT SOMETHING TO EAT?

998
00:23:16,095 --> 00:23:17,029
DO YOU WANT ME TO MAKE YOU

999
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:17,830
A SANDWICH, KAYLA?

1000
00:23:17,830 --> 00:23:23,436
'CAUSE, ARE YOU HUNGRY?

1001
00:23:23,436 --> 00:23:24,604
>> [gulping]

1002
00:23:24,604 --> 00:23:27,907
>> [whispers]

1003
00:23:27,907 --> 00:23:28,975
>> DO YOU WANT SOMETHING TO EAT,

1004
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:29,742
FOR REAL?

1005
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,210
>> I DON'T FEEL HUNGRY.

1006
00:23:31,210 --> 00:23:32,545
>> I THINK YOU ARE HUNGRY,

1007
00:23:32,545 --> 00:23:33,713
THOUGH.

1008
00:23:33,713 --> 00:23:34,681
>> I THINK YOU'RE REALLY HOT

1009
00:23:34,681 --> 00:23:35,247
TOO.

1010
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,182
>> ALL SHE ATE WAS VANILLA

1011
00:23:36,182 --> 00:23:37,016
WAFERS THIS MORNING.

1012
00:23:37,016 --> 00:23:37,884
>> DO YOU WANT TO CALL

1013
00:23:37,884 --> 00:23:38,585
YOUR DOCTOR?

1014
00:23:38,585 --> 00:23:39,519
>> I FEEL LIKE I NEED TO.

1015
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:40,419
>> WHERE'S YOUR PHONE?

1016
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,589
>> CAN YOU TALK TO HIM?

1017
00:23:42,589 --> 00:23:44,591
HERE.

1018
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:45,424
>> HELLO?

1019
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,226
THIS IS ONE OF HER FRIENDS.

1020
00:23:49,095 --> 00:23:50,597
>> LET'S ME SEE.

1021
00:23:50,597 --> 00:23:52,398
NO.

1022
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:53,966
>> DO YOU HAVE PAIN

1023
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:55,001
IN YOUR EYES?

1024
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:56,836
IT'S HER HEAD AND HER EYES.

1025
00:23:56,836 --> 00:23:58,638
IT'S JUST ALL PRESSURE.

1026
00:24:00,507 --> 00:24:01,173
>> WHAT?

1027
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:02,975
>> OH, MY GOD.

1028
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:05,778
>> OH, MY GOD.

1029
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:06,613
[sobbing]

1030
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:08,414
I'M SO SCARED.

1031
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:14,120
>> I JUST FEEL REALLY WEAK.

1032
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:32,438
>> OH, MY GOSH.

1033
00:24:32,438 --> 00:24:33,239
I DON'T FEEL GOOD.

1034
00:24:33,239 --> 00:24:34,140
MY FRIENDS GOT ME TO THE

1035
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:35,608
HOSPITAL JUST IN TIME.

1036
00:24:35,608 --> 00:24:36,442
>> AND YOU'RE HAVING

1037
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:37,644
CONTRACTIONS, AND A LOT OF

1038
00:24:37,644 --> 00:24:38,978
TIMES, WHEN YOU'RE THIS EARLY,

1039
00:24:38,978 --> 00:24:40,146
WE START LOOKING AT PRETERM

1040
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:41,480
LABOR.

1041
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,315
>> I TEXTED MY MOM, AND SHE'S

1042
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,984
COMING, BUT SHE'S AN HOUR AWAY

1043
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,653
AT HER BOYFRIEND'S, SO I'M

1044
00:24:46,653 --> 00:24:47,720
GRATEFUL MIKE LEFT WORK AND

1045
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,222
RUSHED STRAIGHT TO THE HOSPITAL.

1046
00:24:50,222 --> 00:24:51,123
>> MICHAEL, I CAN'T SEE

1047
00:24:51,123 --> 00:24:52,525
ANYTHING.

1048
00:24:52,525 --> 00:24:53,459
>> DIZZY AND LIGHT-HEADED?

1049
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:54,360
>> MM-HMM.

1050
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,863
REALLY, REALLY BAD.

1051
00:24:56,863 --> 00:24:57,764
>> THE LIGHT-HEADED AND

1052
00:24:57,764 --> 00:24:58,865
DIZZINESS OFTENTIMES WILL HAPPEN

1053
00:24:58,865 --> 00:24:59,866
IF YOU HAVEN'T ATE OR DRANK

1054
00:24:59,866 --> 00:25:01,300
A WHOLE LOT.

1055
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,334
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE PREGNANT,

1056
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,302
YOU'RE MORE LIKELY TO BECOME

1057
00:25:03,302 --> 00:25:04,604
DEHYDRATED.

1058
00:25:04,604 --> 00:25:06,038
SO DOCTOR SCOTT WANTS FOR US

1059
00:25:06,038 --> 00:25:07,039
TO GIVE YOU SOME FLUIDS,

1060
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,608
SINCE YOU HAVEN'T ATE AND DRANK

1061
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,142
A WHOLE LOT TODAY.

1062
00:25:10,142 --> 00:25:11,611
>> I WAS SO WORRIED I WAS GOING

1063
00:25:11,611 --> 00:25:13,279
TO LOSE THE BABY, BUT THE

1064
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,280
DOCTORS SEEMED TO THINK

1065
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:15,748
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY,

1066
00:25:15,748 --> 00:25:16,649
AND I'M STARTING TO FEEL

1067
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:18,250
A LITTLE BETTER.

1068
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,418
>> HI.

1069
00:25:19,418 --> 00:25:20,352
>> HI.

1070
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:21,353
>> THE BABY IS OKAY?

1071
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:22,188
>> MM-HMM.

1072
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:23,355
HE HAS BEEN REALLY MOVING

1073
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:24,190
A LOT.

1074
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,024
>> HE'S MOVING A LOT

1075
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:25,858
AND EVERYTHING?

1076
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,526
>> YEAH, HE WAS ESPECIALLY

1077
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,861
WHEN I WAS LAYING ON MY BACK.

1078
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:29,696
>> YEAH.

1079
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:31,230
>> IT WAS REALLY SCARY.

1080
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,732
>> KAYLA, IT'S MARY.

1081
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:34,066
>> HI.

1082
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:35,367
>> ALL RIGHT, SO I JUST TALKED

1083
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,703
TO DR. SCOTT, AND WE'RE GONNA

1084
00:25:36,703 --> 00:25:38,204
DISCHARGE YOU, OKAY?

1085
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:38,871
>> OKAY.

1086
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:39,872
>> BUT YOU REALLY NEED TO BE

1087
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:41,808
EATING AND DRINKING, OKAY?

1088
00:25:41,808 --> 00:25:43,175
WHOEVER IS AROUND TO HELP YOU,

1089
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:44,176
TO REMIND YOU.

1090
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:45,177
THAT WAY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE

1091
00:25:45,177 --> 00:25:46,345
HERE FOR THIS TYPE OF THING.

1092
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:47,179
>> YEAH.

1093
00:25:47,179 --> 00:25:48,180
>> 'CAUSE THAT'S NOT ANY FUN,

1094
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,982
OKAY?

1095
00:25:49,982 --> 00:25:50,883
>> DO YOU NEED HELP WITH

1096
00:25:50,883 --> 00:25:52,518
ANYTHING?

1097
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:54,353
>> IT'S TOO LATE FOR MY MOM

1098
00:25:54,353 --> 00:25:56,022
TO BE OFFERING TO HELP.

1099
00:25:56,022 --> 00:25:57,356
I WISH SHE WAS JUST AROUND MORE

1100
00:25:57,356 --> 00:26:00,192
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

1101
00:26:00,192 --> 00:26:01,427
I REALLY HAVE TO TAKE BETTER

1102
00:26:01,427 --> 00:26:03,095
CARE OF MYSELF, SO THE DOCTOR

1103
00:26:03,095 --> 00:26:04,396
MADE ME AN APPOINTMENT TO SEE

1104
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:05,598
A NUTRITIONIST NEXT WEEK,

1105
00:26:05,598 --> 00:26:07,099
BUT MY FRIENDS ARE STILL REALLY

1106
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:08,534
WORRIED ABOUT ME.

1107
00:26:08,534 --> 00:26:09,468
>> MY MOM SAID YOU SHOULD

1108
00:26:09,468 --> 00:26:10,202
EAT CARBS.

1109
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:11,170
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS.

1110
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,171
SHE SAID YOU NEED REALLY GOOD

1111
00:26:12,171 --> 00:26:13,005
CARBS.

1112
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:14,106
>> AREN'T THE CARBS THINGS THAT

1113
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:14,841
MAKE YOU FAT?

1114
00:26:14,841 --> 00:26:16,175
PEOPLE GO ON NO-CARB DIETS.

1115
00:26:16,175 --> 00:26:17,509
>> YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET FAT.

1116
00:26:17,509 --> 00:26:19,345
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HAVING

1117
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:21,013
GOOD CARBS AND A LITTLE PROTEIN.

1118
00:26:21,013 --> 00:26:22,749
OKAY, WHAT ARE YOU HUNGRY FOR?

1119
00:26:22,749 --> 00:26:23,515
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1120
00:26:23,515 --> 00:26:25,084
ALL OF THIS IS REALLY FANCY

1121
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:26,418
AND WEIRD STUFF.

1122
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,286
>> I JUST FEEL SCARED.

1123
00:26:27,286 --> 00:26:28,888
I WANT YOU TO EAT.

1124
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:29,822
>> WELL, I'M NOT DOING IT

1125
00:26:29,822 --> 00:26:30,556
ON PURPOSE.

1126
00:26:30,556 --> 00:26:31,557
>> WELL, I BELIEVE YOU'RE NOT

1127
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:32,792
DOING IT ON PURPOSE, BUT STILL,

1128
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:34,526
IT JUST FRIGHTENS ME.

1129
00:26:34,526 --> 00:26:35,494
>> LIKE, WERE YOU NOT TAKING

1130
00:26:35,494 --> 00:26:36,729
YOUR PRENATAL VITAMINS?

1131
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:38,397
>> NO--WELL, I DO WHEN

1132
00:26:38,397 --> 00:26:39,398
I REMEMBER, WHICH IS, LIKE,

1133
00:26:39,398 --> 00:26:40,432
ONCE A WEEK.

1134
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,768
>> PRENATAL VITAMINS MAKE YOUR

1135
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:42,568
HAIR GROW.

1136
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:43,569
YOU MIGHT AS WELL TAKE IT.

1137
00:26:43,569 --> 00:26:44,236
>> YEAH.

1138
00:26:44,236 --> 00:26:45,137
>> AND YOU SAID YOU WANT

1139
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:47,373
YOUR HAIR TO GROW.

1140
00:26:49,408 --> 00:26:50,576
>> WHAT ARE PEOPLE GONNA THINK

1141
00:26:50,576 --> 00:26:51,610
WHEN THEY SEE YOU ON THE FIRST

1142
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:52,511
DAY OF SCHOOL AND YOU'RE

1143
00:26:52,511 --> 00:26:53,145
PREGNANT?

1144
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:54,146
>> THEY'LL PROBABLY JUST THINK

1145
00:26:54,146 --> 00:26:55,014
I'M A BIG OLD SLUT.

1146
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:56,015
>> NO, THEY WON'T.

1147
00:26:56,015 --> 00:26:56,916
>> PROBABLY.

1148
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:57,917
IT'S OUR SCHOOL, SO...

1149
00:26:57,917 --> 00:26:58,851
>> WELL, WHAT ARE YOU MOST

1150
00:26:58,851 --> 00:26:59,585
NERVOUS ABOUT?

1151
00:26:59,585 --> 00:27:01,287
>> EVERYBODY STARING AT ME.

1152
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:02,188
ARE YOU GUYS EXCITED FOR

1153
00:27:02,188 --> 00:27:03,089
SENIOR YEAR?

1154
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:03,756
>> YEAH.

1155
00:27:03,756 --> 00:27:04,423
>> I AM.

1156
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:05,257
>> I'M SUPER EXCITED.

1157

>> I FEEL LIKE YOUR SENIOR YEAR

1158
00:27:06,358 --> 00:27:07,459
IS GONNA BE A LOT MORE EVENTFUL

1159
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:08,127
THAN MINE.

1160
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:09,028
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK THE

1161
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:09,962
TEACHERS ARE GONNA THINK?

1162
00:27:09,962 --> 00:27:10,963
>> DO YOU THINK TEACHERS CAN,

1163
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:11,864
LIKE, PURPOSELY FAIL YOU

1164
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:12,732
BECAUSE THEY HATE YOU?

1165
00:27:12,732 --> 00:27:13,866
>> NO, NO, THEY CAN'T.

1166
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:14,767
>> I THINK, AS TEACHERS,

1167
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:16,035
THEY SHOULD BE PROFESSIONAL

1168
00:27:16,035 --> 00:27:18,570
ENOUGH NOT TO BE JUDGMENTAL.

1169
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:19,538
>> THEY'RE STILL GONNA THINK

1170
00:27:19,538 --> 00:27:20,506
THINGS, EVEN IF THEY DON'T,

1171
00:27:20,506 --> 00:27:22,241
LIKE, ACT ON IT.

[alarm clock buzzing]

1173
00:27:25,912 --> 00:27:27,113
THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL

1174
00:27:27,113 --> 00:27:28,280
IS FINALLY HERE.

1175
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:29,615
I KNOW IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO HIDE

1176
00:27:29,615 --> 00:27:31,483
MY HUGE BELLY, SO THE LEAST

1177
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:33,552
I CAN DO IS TRY TO LOOK MY BEST.

1178
00:27:38,758 --> 00:27:39,425
>> HI.

1179
00:27:39,425 --> 00:27:40,092
>> HEY.

1180
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:41,260
>> ARE YOU READY FOR SCHOOL?

1181
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:43,462
>> NOT REALLY.

1182
00:27:43,462 --> 00:27:44,797
>> FOR SENIOR YEAR, WE ALL HAVE

1183
00:27:44,797 --> 00:27:45,631
TO WALK IN AND SAY--

1184
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:46,598
>> SENIORS!

1185
00:27:46,598 --> 00:27:48,434
>> SENIOR, SENIOR, SENIOR!

00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:49,769
[clapping]

1187
00:27:49,769 --> 00:27:51,103
>> WE'RE GONNA GO!

1188
00:27:51,103 --> 00:27:52,271
>> I WISH I COULD BE AS EXCITED

1189
00:27:52,271 --> 00:27:53,773
ABOUT SENIOR YEAR AS MY FRIENDS

1190
00:27:53,773 --> 00:27:54,707
ARE.

1191
00:27:54,707 --> 00:27:55,708
>> SENIORS, SENIORS!

1192
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:57,376
[crowd clapping]

1193
00:27:57,376 --> 00:27:58,544
>> BUT SCHOOL WAS REALLY

1194
00:27:58,544 --> 00:27:59,545
AWKWARD.

1195
00:27:59,545 --> 00:28:00,713
EVERYONE STARED AT ME.

1196
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:02,048
IT WAS EXHAUSTING,

1197
00:28:02,048 --> 00:28:03,549
AND I COULDN'T FIT IN MY DESK,

1198
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:06,318
LET ALONE FOCUS ON MY WORK.

1199
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:08,520
I HATE SCHOOL,

1200
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,521
LIKE, JUST ALTOGETHER,

1201
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:10,923
AND NOW IT'S EVEN HARDER TO GO.

1202
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:11,924
>> WELL, HOW DID THE TEACHERS

1203
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:12,725
TAKE IT?

1204
00:28:12,725 --> 00:28:13,826
>> NONE OF THEM, LIKE, ASKED ME

1205
00:28:13,826 --> 00:28:15,227
ABOUT IT OR SAID ANYTHING.

1206
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:15,895
>> MM-HMM.

1207
00:28:15,895 --> 00:28:17,063
WHAT ABOUT EVERYONE, LIKE,

1208
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:18,397
JUST, LIKE, ALL THE STUDENTS

1209
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:19,298
AND EVERYTHING?

1210
00:28:19,298 --> 00:28:20,399
>> LIKE, NOBODY WAS REALLY RUDE

1211
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,367
ABOUT IT, BUT THEY JUST ALL

1212
00:28:21,367 --> 00:28:22,334
KIND OF STARED AND, LIKE...

1213
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:23,669
>> YEAH.

1214
00:28:23,669 --> 00:28:24,670
DO YOU JUST FEEL OUT OF PLACE

1215
00:28:24,670 --> 00:28:25,371
AND AWKWARD?

1216
00:28:25,371 --> 00:28:26,138
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1217
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:27,239
I JUST THOUGHT THAT SENIOR YEAR

1218
00:28:27,239 --> 00:28:28,240
WOULD BE, LIKE, FULL OF, LIKE,

1219
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,308
PARTIES AND FOOTBALL GAMES

1220
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:31,143
AND STUFF LIKE THAT.

1221
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:32,478
AND NOW, LIKE, I CAN'T DO

1222
00:28:32,478 --> 00:28:34,781
ANY OF THEM.

1223
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,022
IT'S BEEN A WEEK SINCE I WAS

1224
00:28:43,022 --> 00:28:44,690
IN THE HOSPITAL, AND I STILL

1225
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,525
HAVEN'T SEEN MUCH OF MY MOM.

1226
00:28:46,525 --> 00:28:47,927
BUT TODAY, SHE AGREED TO COME

1227
00:28:47,927 --> 00:28:49,896
WITH ME TO SEE THE NUTRITIONIST.

1228
00:28:49,896 --> 00:28:51,730
>> THE EATING DISORDER VOICE,

1229
00:28:51,730 --> 00:28:52,899
IS IT LOUDER NOW THAN--

1230
00:28:52,899 --> 00:28:54,000
>> WELL, BEFORE I WAS PREGNANT,

1231
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,401
I WAS IN GYMNASTICS, AND I FELT

1232
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:56,568
LIKE I WAS IN REALLY GOOD SHAPE,

1233
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:57,736
AND I ACTUALLY KIND OF LIKED

1234
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:59,405
WHERE I WAS AT IN MY LIFE.

1235
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:01,573
AND THEN NOW IT SEEMS LIKE,

1236
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:02,574
SINCE I GOT PREGNANT,

1237
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:03,742
I JUST, LIKE, LOST CONTROL.

1238
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:04,576
>> SO YOU'RE BACK TO

1239
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:05,344
A PRETTY LOUD...

1240
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:06,412
>> YEAH, EXTREMELY.

1241
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:08,414
LIKE, IT'S--EVERYTHING I EAT,

1242
00:29:08,414 --> 00:29:09,581
"CRAP, I SHOULDN'T HAVE EATEN

1243
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:10,549
THAT," OR, "WHY DID YOU EAT

1244
00:29:10,549 --> 00:29:11,283
TWO OF THOSE?

1245
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:12,184
YOU ONLY NEEDED ONE."

1246
00:29:12,184 --> 00:29:14,186
>> TRULY, YOU SHOULD BE EATING

1247
00:29:14,186 --> 00:29:16,355
EVERY FOUR TO SIX HOURS

1248
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,090
AND THEN AN IN-BETWEEN SNACK

1249
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,758
EVERY TWO TO THREE HOURS.

1250
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:21,093
DOES THAT KIND OF SCARE YOU?

1251
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,929
EATING THAT FREQUENTLY?

1252
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:23,863
>> YEAH.

1253
00:29:23,863 --> 00:29:24,864
>> YOU ALMOST HAVE TO LOOK AT

1254
00:29:24,864 --> 00:29:26,032
FOOD RIGHT NOW AS KIND OF

1255
00:29:26,032 --> 00:29:28,434
MEDICINE FOR YOU, BECAUSE YOU'RE

1256
00:29:28,434 --> 00:29:29,768
PREGNANT, YOU KNOW?

1257
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,303
AND THE BABY NEEDS CERTAIN

1258
00:29:31,303 --> 00:29:32,805
NUTRIENTS.

1259
00:29:32,805 --> 00:29:34,140
SO HOW MANY TIMES A WEEK

1260
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,307
DO YOU THINK YOU EAT TOGETHER

1261
00:29:35,307 --> 00:29:37,910
AS A FAMILY?

1262
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,011
>> THERE'S A LOT OF TIMES WHERE

1263
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:39,745
I'M ON MY OWN.

1264
00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:41,013
>> I WOULD RECOMMEND TO EAT

1265
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:42,348
WITH PEOPLE.

1266
00:29:42,348 --> 00:29:43,349
>> OKAY.

1267
00:29:43,349 --> 00:29:44,250
>> I THINK THAT WOULD BE

1268
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,384
VERY IMPORTANT.

1269
00:29:45,384 --> 00:29:46,385
>> I THINK SHE WOULD RESTRICT

1270
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:47,719
HERSELF WHEN SHE HAS PEOPLE

1271
00:29:47,719 --> 00:29:48,855
WATCHING HER...

1272
00:29:48,855 --> 00:29:49,521
>> MM-HMM.

1273
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:50,622
>> RATHER THAN IF SHE'S AT HOME

1274
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:54,393
BY HERSELF, SHE'LL EAT.

1275
00:29:54,393 --> 00:29:56,062
>> YEAH, THE ONLY PROBLEM WITH

1276
00:29:56,062 --> 00:29:57,729
EATING ALONE IS, IT BECOMES

1277
00:29:57,729 --> 00:29:58,730
MORE SECRETIVE.

1278
00:29:58,730 --> 00:30:00,066
>> MM-HMM.

1279
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:01,400
>> AND THEN THAT MAKES THE

1280
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,235

YOU'RE THINKING.

1287

BUT IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE THERE,

1288
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:17,649

CHANGED.

00:30:53,052 --> 00:30:54,553
FROM SCHOOL, BUT IT HASN'T

1302
00:30:54,553 --> 00:30:55,721
BEEN EASY.

1303
00:30:55,721 --> 00:30:57,056
>> HOW IS IT?

1304
00:30:57,056 --> 00:30:58,390
>> KIND OF GROSS.

1305
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,791
>> THIS IS ACTUALLY PRETTY GOOD.

1306
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:00,960
>> IT'S REALLY GROSS.

1307
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,394
>> COME ON, JUST HAVE SOME.

1308
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:03,229
>> NO, IT'S NASTY.

1309
00:31:03,229 --> 00:31:04,563
LIKE, IT'S ORANGE AND BURNT

1310
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:06,065
AND GROSS.

1311
00:31:06,065 --> 00:31:06,999
>> THEN WHAT DO YOU WANT?

1312
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:08,400
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1313
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,902
>> CEREAL?

1314
00:31:09,902 --> 00:31:11,403
>> NO.

1315
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:12,604
>> APPLE SAUCE?

1316
00:31:12,604 --> 00:31:14,273
DO YOU WANT, LIKE, A REAL MEAL?

1317
00:31:14,273 --> 00:31:15,107
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1318
00:31:15,107 --> 00:31:16,342
>> SPAGHETTI?

1319
00:31:16,342 --> 00:31:18,677
>> NO.

1320
00:31:18,677 --> 00:31:19,845
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT?

1321
00:31:19,845 --> 00:31:21,247
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1322
00:31:21,247 --> 00:31:22,181
>> THEN HOW AM I SUPPOSED

1323
00:31:22,181 --> 00:31:23,449
TO FEED YOU?

1324
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:24,450
THE BABY IS GONNA NEED YOU--

1325
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:25,617
>> JUST PUT THE FOOD AWAY.

1326
00:31:25,617 --> 00:31:27,153
IT'S MAKING ME SICK.

1327
00:31:27,153 --> 00:31:29,488
I KNOW MIKE IS TRYING TO HELP,

1328
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:31,690
BUT I'M JUST NOT HUNGRY.

1329
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,292
>> SOUNDS GOOD TODAY.

1330
00:31:33,292 --> 00:31:34,293
HE SOUNDS GOOD.

1331
00:31:34,293 --> 00:31:35,461
HE SOUNDS HAPPY.

1332
00:31:35,461 --> 00:31:37,129
SO LOOKING AT YOUR WEIGHT HERE,

1333
00:31:37,129 --> 00:31:38,064
IT LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVEN'T

1334
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:39,331
GAINED WEIGHT.

1335
00:31:39,331 --> 00:31:40,266
WE NEED TO WORK ON GETTING

1336
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:41,133
MORE NUTRITION IN YOU.

1337
00:31:41,133 --> 00:31:41,767
>> YEAH.

1338
00:31:41,767 --> 00:31:42,801
>> 'CAUSE I KNOW THE NURSES SAID

1339
00:31:42,801 --> 00:31:43,735
YOU HADN'T EATEN MUCH WHEN

1340
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,071
YOU GOT TO THE HOSPITAL.

1341
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:46,005
YOU KNOW, WE GET CONCERNED

1342
00:31:46,005 --> 00:31:47,073
WHEN WE DON'T SEE WEIGHT GAIN,

1343
00:31:47,073 --> 00:31:48,074
THAT THAT COULD BE SOMETHING

1344
00:31:48,074 --> 00:31:49,075
THAT THE BABY IS NOT GETTING

1345
00:31:49,075 --> 00:31:50,242
ENOUGH NUTRITION OR YOU'RE NOT

1346
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:51,810
GETTING ENOUGH NUTRITION.

1347
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:52,678
ANY MORE LIGHT-HEADED,

1348
00:31:52,678 --> 00:31:54,913
ANYTHING LIKE THAT?

1349
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,915
>> SOMETIMES I GET TIRED,

1350
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:57,984
AND I'LL JUST SIT DOWN AND DRINK

1351
00:31:57,984 --> 00:31:58,985
SOME WATER, AND THEN I'LL FEEL

1352
00:31:58,985 --> 00:31:59,785
BETTER RIGHT AWAY.

1353
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:00,586
>> A LOT OF TIMES,

1354
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:01,487
LIGHT-HEADEDNESS CAN BE

1355
00:32:01,487 --> 00:32:02,488
A SYMPTOM OF SOMETHING WRONG.

1356
00:32:02,488 --> 00:32:03,389
SO YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE

1357
00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:04,456
YOU'RE EATING REGULAR MEALS.

1358
00:32:04,456 --> 00:32:06,625
BABIES NEED A LOT MORE ENERGY

1359
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:08,194
THAN WHAT YOU'RE USED TO EATING.

1360
00:32:08,194 --> 00:32:09,195
AND IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE

1361
00:32:09,195 --> 00:32:10,196
A LOT OF HIGH-CALORIE FOOD,

1362
00:32:10,196 --> 00:32:11,697
BUT GETTING MORE FOOD IN

1363
00:32:11,697 --> 00:32:13,732
WILL HELP.

1364
00:32:17,336 --> 00:32:18,304
>> SO HOW HAVE YOUR DOCTOR'S

1365
00:32:18,304 --> 00:32:19,338
APPOINTMENTS BEEN GOING?

1366
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:21,007
>> THE DOCTOR WAS KIND OF

1367
00:32:21,007 --> 00:32:22,174
CONCERNED, 'CAUSE I GUESS

1368
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:23,275
I HAVEN'T GAINED WEIGHT,

1369
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:25,344
WHICH IS UNUSUAL FOR THE END,

1370
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:26,678
BECAUSE THE BABY IS STILL

1371
00:32:26,678 --> 00:32:28,014
GAINING.

1372
00:32:28,014 --> 00:32:29,515
AND SO, LIKE, I SHOULD OBVIOUSLY

1373
00:32:29,515 --> 00:32:30,516
BE PUTTING ON ALL THE WEIGHT

1374
00:32:30,516 --> 00:32:31,717
LIKE THE BABY IS.

1375
00:32:31,717 --> 00:32:32,818
>> ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT SINCE

1376
00:32:32,818 --> 00:32:33,885
YOU HAVEN'T GAINED ANY WEIGHT,

1377
00:32:33,885 --> 00:32:35,421
LIKE, THE BABY ISN'T GETTING

1378
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:36,155
ANY NUTRITION?

1379
00:32:36,155 --> 00:32:37,623
>> OBVIOUSLY, I WANT HIM

1380
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:39,291
TO BE HEALTHY AND STUFF.

1381
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,292
THAT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO ME

1382
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,293
THAN THE AMOUNT OF WEIGHT

1383
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:42,128
I PUT ON.

1384
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:42,961
>> MM-HMM.

1385
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,130
>> BUT IT'S JUST--IT'S STILL

1386
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,631
HARD TO GET OVER.

1387
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:46,999
LIKE, WHEN YOU HAVE, LIKE,

1388
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:48,334
AN EATING DISORDER BRAIN,

1389
00:32:48,334 --> 00:32:50,002
IT'S JUST THE WAY IT WORKS.

1390
00:32:50,002 --> 00:32:51,337
LIKE, IN THE BACK OF MY MIND,

1391
00:32:51,337 --> 00:32:53,005
YEAH, I KNOW HE NEEDS FOOD,

1392
00:32:53,005 --> 00:32:54,506
AND I NEED TO BE HEALTHY

1393
00:32:54,506 --> 00:32:55,674
FOR HIM, AND HE'S THE MOST

1394
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:56,608
IMPORTANT THING, BUT THAT

1395
00:32:56,608 --> 00:32:58,010
DOESN'T STOP ALL THE OTHER

1396
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,345
THOUGHTS.

1397
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:00,512
I KNOW I HAVE TO PUT THE BABY

1398
00:33:00,512 --> 00:33:01,847
FIRST, BUT IT'S REALLY HARD

1399
00:33:01,847 --> 00:33:03,649
FOR ME.

1400
00:33:06,952 --> 00:33:08,587
ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE,

1401
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:09,588
MY DUE DATE IS ONLY TWO WEEKS

1402
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:10,422
AWAY.

1403
00:33:10,422 --> 00:33:11,590
I'M GOING TO DO HOMESCHOOL

1404
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,591
FOR FIVE WEEKS AFTER I HAVE

1405
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:14,426
THE BABY, BUT I'M WORRIED ABOUT

1406
00:33:14,426 --> 00:33:15,761
STAYING ON TRACK, BECAUSE

1407
00:33:15,761 --> 00:33:17,696
IT'S ALREADY HARD TO KEEP UP.

1408
00:33:17,696 --> 00:33:19,198
>> IS THAT ALL FOR ONE CLASS?

1409
00:33:19,198 --> 00:33:20,366
>> YEAH.

1410
00:33:20,366 --> 00:33:22,668
THIS IS FOR ONE CLASS.

1411
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:23,569
WHAT DID YOU DO FOR YOUR

1412
00:33:23,569 --> 00:33:24,636
POLITICAL CARTOON?

1413
00:33:24,636 --> 00:33:25,304
>> WHAT?

1414
00:33:25,304 --> 00:33:26,238
>> YOUR POL--YOU'RE NOT IN

1415
00:33:26,238 --> 00:33:26,905
GOVERNMENT.

1416
00:33:26,905 --> 00:33:27,539
DANG IT.

1417
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:28,807
>> NO, FOR SENIOR STRATEGIES,

1418
00:33:28,807 --> 00:33:30,809
A COLLEGE CAME THAT'S CALLED,

1419
00:33:30,809 --> 00:33:32,311
LIKE, ARGOSY SCHOOL.

1420
00:33:32,311 --> 00:33:34,813
AND THEY MAJOR IN, LIKE, VET,

1421
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:36,148
AND THEY HAVE, LIKE, AN ON-SET

1422
00:33:36,148 --> 00:33:37,116
SITE, SO I REALLY WANT TO GO

1423
00:33:37,116 --> 00:33:37,783
THERE.

1424
00:33:37,783 --> 00:33:38,784
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA

1425
00:33:38,784 --> 00:33:39,518
DO FOR COLLEGE?

1426
00:33:39,518 --> 00:33:42,020
>> I JUST THINK, IF I NEVER HAD

1427
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,022
THE BABY, THAT I DIDN'T WANT

1428
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:46,358
TO STAY AROUND HERE.

1429
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,859
LIKE, I HAD, LIKE, BIG DREAMS

1430
00:33:47,859 --> 00:33:49,027
AND STUFF FOR MYSELF,

1431
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,230
AND I DON'T WANT TO HOLD BACK

1432
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,064
BECAUSE OF THAT.

1433
00:33:52,064 --> 00:33:52,798
>> YEAH.

1434
00:33:52,798 --> 00:33:53,799
>> EVERYBODY IS GONNA PICK UP

1435
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:56,135
AND HAVE--GO ACCOMPLISH ALL

1436
00:33:56,135 --> 00:33:57,303
THEIR DREAMS, AND I DON'T WANT

1437
00:33:57,303 --> 00:33:59,471
TO BE STUCK HERE BECAUSE OF,

1438
00:33:59,471 --> 00:34:02,641
THAT I HAD A BABY, AND I'M JUST

1439
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:03,975
STUCK HERE, LIVING WITH MY MOM

1440
00:34:03,975 --> 00:34:07,979
AND BEING, LIKE, A LOSER.

1441
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:09,315
IT SUCKS THAT I HAVE TO PUT

1442
00:34:09,315 --> 00:34:11,517
MY COLLEGE PLANS ASIDE.

1443
00:34:11,517 --> 00:34:13,852
BUT FOR NOW, I HAVE TO FOCUS

1444
00:34:13,852 --> 00:34:15,321
ON GETTING READY FOR THE BABY.

1445
00:34:15,321 --> 00:34:16,988
HE'S DUE IN ONE WEEK,

1446
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:18,324
AND TODAY, MY FRIENDS ARE

1447
00:34:18,324 --> 00:34:20,826
THROWING ME A BABY SHOWER.

1448
00:34:20,826 --> 00:34:22,060
AWW!

1449
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:23,595
IT'S A BALL, MOM.

1450
00:34:23,595 --> 00:34:24,930
THIS IS MY FIRST BAG OF DIAPERS

1451
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:26,031
THAT I OWN.

1452
00:34:26,031 --> 00:34:27,599
[laughter]

1453
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,268
IT'S A LITTLE BATH SET.

1454
00:34:29,268 --> 00:34:30,136
NOW THAT WE HAVE A LOT

1455
00:34:30,136 --> 00:34:31,437
OF WHAT WE NEED...

1456
00:34:31,437 --> 00:34:33,205
THANK YOU!

1457
00:34:33,205 --> 00:34:34,873
IT'S TIME TO GET THE NURSERY

1458
00:34:34,873 --> 00:34:37,843
READY.

1459
00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:40,146
AH, MY ARMS ARE TIRED.

1460
00:34:40,146 --> 00:34:41,313
THE BABY WILL BE HERE REALLY

1461
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:42,314
SOON, AND I'M STARTING TO GET

1462
00:34:42,314 --> 00:34:44,150
NERVOUS.

1463
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,484
I'M GLAD MIKE AGREED TO WATCH

1464
00:34:45,484 --> 00:34:46,652
THE BABY WHEN I GO BACK TO

1465
00:34:46,652 --> 00:34:48,154
SCHOOL, BUT WE'RE GOING TO NEED

1466
00:34:48,154 --> 00:34:50,122
HELP AT FIRST.

1467
00:34:50,122 --> 00:34:51,290
WHAT HAPPENS ON THE DAY WE BRING

1468
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:52,324
HIM HOME?

1469
00:34:52,324 --> 00:34:53,259
>> YOU'RE GONNA BE TIRED.

1470
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:54,460
>> MM-HMM.

1471
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,394
>> YOU'RE GONNA BE TIRED.

1472
00:34:55,394 --> 00:34:56,362
I MEAN, I'M GONNA BE HERE,

1473
00:34:56,362 --> 00:34:57,296
SO...

1474
00:34:57,296 --> 00:34:58,164
>> TILL I GET USED TO

1475
00:34:58,164 --> 00:34:59,298
EVERYTHING, I JUST DON'T

1476
00:34:59,298 --> 00:35:00,399
WANT TO BE ON MY OWN.

1477
00:35:00,399 --> 00:35:02,668
>> WELL, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE.

1478
00:35:09,408 --> 00:35:10,909
>> I HOPE MY MOM IS SERIOUS.

1479
00:35:10,909 --> 00:35:11,910
THE BABY COULD BE HERE

1480
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,245
ANY MOMENT, AND SHE'S STILL

1481
00:35:13,245 --> 00:35:14,246
SPENDING MOST OF HER TIME

1482
00:35:14,246 --> 00:35:16,415
WITH HER BOYFRIEND.

1483

00:35:24,089 --> 00:35:25,291

I DON'T WANT TO DO THIS

1497
00:35:30,629 --> 00:35:32,764

1498
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:33,599
>> YOU'RE NOT ALONE.

I GUESS LEAKING FLUIDS

1520

AND HAVING CONTRACTIONS

1521
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:15,574
ISN'T ENOUGH TO CONVINCE MY MOM

1522
00:36:15,574 --> 00:36:16,942
THAT THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG.

1523
00:36:16,942 --> 00:36:17,943
SO MIKE AND I ARE LEAVING

1524
00:36:17,943 --> 00:36:18,844

1525
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:20,479
TELLING HER.

1526
00:36:23,482 --> 00:36:25,284
I DID NOT PREPARE FOR THIS YET.

1527
00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:44,169
>> WELL, I'M JUST TRYING

1528

>> SETTLE DOWN.

1533
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:51,477
>> OH, MY GOD.

1534
00:36:51,477 --> 00:36:52,278
DON'T EVER TELL ME

1535
00:36:52,278 --> 00:36:53,011
TO SETTLE DOWN.

1536
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:53,879
I'M JUST TELLING YOU.

1537
00:36:53,879 --> 00:36:56,615

BELIEVE ME, SOMETHING IS

1542
00:37:51,937 --> 00:37:53,805
DEFINITELY GOING ON, SO MIKE

1543
00:37:53,805 --> 00:37:55,907
AND I RUSHED TO THE HOSPITAL.

1544
00:37:55,907 --> 00:37:57,409
>> GOT THE AMNISURE BACK,

00:37:57,409 --> 00:37:58,410
AND IT'S POSITIVE.

1546
00:37:58,410 --> 00:38:00,078
SO THAT MEANS YOUR WATER BROKE.

00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:01,880

>> YOU WILL NOT GO HOME

1551
00:38:03,549 --> 00:38:04,483
UNTIL YOU HAVE THAT BABY.

1552

1564
00:38:24,436 --> 00:38:25,737
MIKE TEXTED MY MOM,

1565

1566
00:38:27,238 --> 00:38:29,074

00:45:58,423 --> 00:45:59,424
WAY NOW?

1850
00:45:59,424 --> 00:46:00,425
>> I JUST LOOK LIKE A WRINKLY

1851
00:46:00,425 --> 00:46:01,426
OLD LADY.

1852
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:02,760
IT'S NOT ATTRACTIVE.

1853
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,694
>> SO IT'S NOT, LIKE, FAT.

1854
00:46:03,694 --> 00:46:04,695
IT'S JUST SKIN.

1855
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:05,530
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1856
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:06,865
>> IF YOU WORKED OUT

1857
00:46:06,865 --> 00:46:08,033
OR WHATEVER AND, LIKE--

1858
00:46:08,033 --> 00:46:09,034
I DON'T KNOW.

1859
00:46:09,034 --> 00:46:09,935
>> BUT I JUST DON'T HAVE

1860
00:46:09,935 --> 00:46:10,836
THE TIME TO, LIKE, HAVE

1861
00:46:10,836 --> 00:46:11,736
A GYM MEMBERSHIP AND GO

1862
00:46:11,736 --> 00:46:13,704
TO THE GYM AND DEDICATE

1863
00:46:13,704 --> 00:46:15,706
FIVE DAYS OF THE WEEK TO IT.

1864
00:46:15,706 --> 00:46:16,741
>> I DON'T THINK THAT YOU NEED

1865
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:17,775
TO LOSE ANY WEIGHT.

1866
00:46:17,775 --> 00:46:19,444
I JUST THINK THAT IT'S MORE

1867
00:46:19,444 --> 00:46:21,446
ABOUT WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY,

1868
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:24,249
LIKE...

1869
00:46:24,249 --> 00:46:25,917
>> I JUST WANT MY BODY BACK,

1870
00:46:25,917 --> 00:46:27,585
AND RIGHT NOW, SKIPPING MEALS

1871
00:46:27,585 --> 00:46:30,688
IS THE EASIEST WAY.

1872
00:46:30,688 --> 00:46:33,024
I'M BEHIND IN ALL MY CLASSES,

1873
00:46:33,024 --> 00:46:34,359
SO SINCE MIKE ONLY WORKS

1874
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:35,626
PART-TIME, HE'S TAKING CARE

1875
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:36,928
OF PRESTON WHILE I MEET WITH

1876
00:46:36,928 --> 00:46:37,929
A HOMESCHOOL TEACHER

1877
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:39,364
TO CATCH UP.

1878
00:46:39,364 --> 00:46:40,698
>> I HAVE WORK FOR YOU

1879
00:46:40,698 --> 00:46:43,869
FROM DIFFERENT TEACHERS,

1880
00:46:43,869 --> 00:46:45,203
A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING.

1881
00:46:45,203 --> 00:46:46,071
>> IT LOOKS LIKE A LOT

1882
00:46:46,071 --> 00:46:46,872
OF EVERYTHING.

1883
00:46:46,872 --> 00:46:47,705
[laughter]

1884
00:46:47,705 --> 00:46:48,673
>> IT'S A LOT OF EVERYTHING.

1885
00:46:48,673 --> 00:46:49,374
YOU'RE RIGHT.

1886
00:46:49,374 --> 00:46:50,341
SO HERE ARE YOUR ASSIGNMENTS

1887
00:46:50,341 --> 00:46:52,577
FOR YOUR ANATOMY CLASS.

1888
00:46:52,577 --> 00:46:54,579
UH, I'VE GOT SOME BANKING

1889
00:46:54,579 --> 00:46:55,881
HOMEWORK.

1890
00:46:55,881 --> 00:46:57,715
>> THIS IS FROM SENIOR YEAR

1891
00:46:57,715 --> 00:46:58,716
STRATEGIES, PROBABLY.

1892
00:46:58,716 --> 00:46:59,550
>> CORRECT.

1893
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:00,518
>> JEEZ.

1894
00:47:00,518 --> 00:47:01,853
>> LOOKS LIKE YOUR GOVERNMENT

1895
00:47:01,853 --> 00:47:02,921
HOMEWORK.

1896
00:47:02,921 --> 00:47:05,590
LOOKS LIKE YOU HAVE QUITE A BIT

1897
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:06,457
HERE.

1898
00:47:06,457 --> 00:47:07,458
>> BUT THIS CLASS IS REALLY--

1899
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:08,459
I REALLY LIKE THIS CLASS,

1900
00:47:08,459 --> 00:47:09,627
SO THIS IS GONNA BE EASIER,

1901
00:47:09,627 --> 00:47:10,996
BUT IT'S JUST...

1902
00:47:10,996 --> 00:47:11,897
>> IT'S A LOT TO TAKE IN

1903
00:47:11,897 --> 00:47:12,830
ALL AT ONCE, ISN'T IT?

1904
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:13,965
>> YEAH.

1905
00:47:13,965 --> 00:47:15,000
>> I KNOW IT'S HARD TO FIND TIME

1906
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:16,134
WITH THE BABY IN THE HOUSE.

1907
00:47:16,134 --> 00:47:18,336
I REALIZE THAT.

1908
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:19,837
BUT YOU REALLY HAVE TO BUCKLE

1909
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,839
DOWN AND MAKE A TIME TO DO IT

1910
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:22,840
EVERY DAY.

1911
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,009
>> WONDERFUL.

1912
00:47:24,009 --> 00:47:25,877
>> YEAH.

1913
00:47:25,877 --> 00:47:27,212
>> GETTING ALL THIS WORK DONE

1914
00:47:27,212 --> 00:47:29,047
WILL BE TOUGH BECAUSE PRESTON

1915
00:47:29,047 --> 00:47:33,684
NEEDS CONSTANT ATTENTION.

1916
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:34,719
>> YOU WANT ME TO MAKE A BOTTLE?

1917
00:47:34,719 --> 00:47:35,553
YOU CAN CHANGE HIM.

1918
00:47:35,553 --> 00:47:36,187
>> YEAH.

1919
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:38,990
>> [crying]

1920
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:44,362
>> SHOULD BE FINE.

1921
00:47:44,362 --> 00:47:46,264
>> YUM, YUM, YUM, YUM, YUM.

1922
00:47:46,264 --> 00:47:47,832
THAT WAS EMBARRASSING.

1923
00:47:47,832 --> 00:47:48,666
>> WHY?

1924
00:47:48,666 --> 00:47:49,600
>> 'CAUSE PEOPLE PROBABLY

1925
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:50,535
THOUGHT I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT

1926
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:51,502
I WAS DOING, 'CAUSE HE WAS,

1927
00:47:51,502 --> 00:47:52,770
LIKE, SCREAMING AT ME.

1928
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:53,538
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1929
00:47:53,538 --> 00:47:54,372
I THINK WE KNOW WHAT

1930
00:47:54,372 --> 00:47:55,073
WE'RE DOING.

1931
00:47:55,073 --> 00:47:56,107
LIKE, 98% OF THE TIME,

1932
00:47:56,107 --> 00:47:57,275
WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE DOING.

1933
00:47:57,275 --> 00:47:58,209
>> YEAH.

1934
00:47:58,209 --> 00:47:59,377
CAN YOU FEED HIM?

1935
00:47:59,377 --> 00:48:03,148
>> YEAH.

1936
00:48:03,148 --> 00:48:04,315
YOU OKAY NOW WITH DADDY?

1937
00:48:04,315 --> 00:48:06,017
YEAH!

1938
00:48:06,017 --> 00:48:07,018
SO WHAT ARE YOUR FRIENDS DOING

1939
00:48:07,018 --> 00:48:07,685
TODAY?

1940
00:48:07,685 --> 00:48:08,686
>> THEY'RE ALL AT A GYMNASTICS

1941
00:48:08,686 --> 00:48:09,354
MEET.

1942
00:48:09,354 --> 00:48:10,188
>> DO YOU MISS IT?

1943
00:48:10,188 --> 00:48:11,222
>> YEAH.

1944
00:48:11,222 --> 00:48:13,891
I MISS BEING IN SHAPE TOO.

1945
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,226
LIKE, I WASN'T EVEN THAT GOOD,

1946
00:48:15,226 --> 00:48:17,395
BUT I LIKED GOING TO PRACTICES

1947
00:48:17,395 --> 00:48:18,563
AND STUFF.

1948
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:20,165
>> I LIKED WATCHING YOU.

1949
00:48:20,165 --> 00:48:21,032
>> YOU USED TO LIKE THE

1950
00:48:21,032 --> 00:48:21,967
LEOTARDS.

1951
00:48:21,967 --> 00:48:25,170
>> A LITTLE BIT.

1952
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:27,305
>> [laughs]

1953
00:48:27,305 --> 00:48:28,873
>> WHY DO WE KEEP DOING THIS?

1954
00:48:28,873 --> 00:48:30,041
WE, LIKE, EAT OUT ALL THE TIME,

1955
00:48:30,041 --> 00:48:30,775
AND WE CAN'T--

1956
00:48:30,775 --> 00:48:31,809
>> WE DO EAT OUT ALL THE TIME.

1957
00:48:31,809 --> 00:48:32,777
>> AND WE CAN'T AFFORD IT.

1958
00:48:32,777 --> 00:48:33,644
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

1959
00:48:33,644 --> 00:48:34,645
I DIDN'T REALIZE HOW EXPENSIVE

1960
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:35,680
IT WOULD BE TO TAKE CARE OF HIM,

1961
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,614
'CAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A LOT

1962
00:48:36,614 --> 00:48:37,315
OF MONEY.

1963
00:48:37,315 --> 00:48:38,316
>> YEAH.

1964
00:48:38,316 --> 00:48:39,484
>> WE REALLY DO NEED TO START

1965
00:48:39,484 --> 00:48:40,986
WATCHING OUR SPENDING, BECAUSE

1966
00:48:40,986 --> 00:48:42,153
TAKING CARE OF PRESTON

1967
00:48:42,153 --> 00:48:43,621
IS EXPENSIVE, AND IT'S ABOUT

1968
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:45,290
TO COST EVEN MORE, BECAUSE

1969
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:46,457
MY MOM WANTS MIKE TO START

1970
00:48:46,457 --> 00:48:47,959
PAYING RENT.

1971
00:48:47,959 --> 00:48:48,926
>> IS IT POSSIBLE TO START

1972
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:50,095
HELPING OUT?

1973
00:48:50,095 --> 00:48:52,097
>> LIKE WHAT?

1974
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:53,598
>> WITH FINANCES AND THINGS

1975
00:48:53,598 --> 00:48:54,832
AROUND THE HOUSE.

1976
00:48:54,832 --> 00:48:58,003
>> WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

1977
00:48:58,003 --> 00:48:59,337
>> ROUGHLY $300.

1978
00:48:59,337 --> 00:49:00,505
>> IS THAT, LIKE, WITH, LIKE,

1979
00:49:00,505 --> 00:49:02,173
GROCERIES OR IS THAT--

1980
00:49:02,173 --> 00:49:02,840
>> NO.

1981
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,774
>> HE'D STILL HAVE TO HELP

1982
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,110
PAY FOR GROCERIES AND STUFF

1983
00:49:05,110 --> 00:49:05,776
LIKE THAT.

1984
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:06,711
>> YOU KNOW, IF EVERYBODY

1985
00:49:06,711 --> 00:49:07,645
CAN CHIP IN, IT'S GONNA BE

1986
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:09,280
LESS STRESSFUL FOR EVERYBODY.

1987
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,215
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, I'M SURE

1988
00:49:10,215 --> 00:49:11,149
IT'S GOT TO MAKE YOU GUYS

1989
00:49:11,149 --> 00:49:12,283
FEEL LIKE CRAP IF YOU DON'T PAY

1990
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:14,352
FOR ANYTHING, RIGHT?

1991
00:49:14,352 --> 00:49:16,354
>> WELL, WE HAD TALKED ABOUT HIM

1992
00:49:16,354 --> 00:49:17,522
BEING ABLE TO STAY HERE

1993
00:49:17,522 --> 00:49:18,256
ALL THE TIME.

1994
00:49:18,256 --> 00:49:19,257
LIKE, YOU TOLD ME, AS LONG AS

1995
00:49:19,257 --> 00:49:20,525
I WAS TAKEN CARE OF AND PRESTON

1996
00:49:20,525 --> 00:49:22,360
WAS TAKEN CARE OF AND MIKE COULD

1997
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:23,628
SUPPLY EVERYTHING THAT THE TWO

1998
00:49:23,628 --> 00:49:25,163
OF US NEEDED, THAT YOU WOULDN'T

1999
00:49:25,163 --> 00:49:27,332
WORRY ABOUT RENT, AND, LIKE,

2000
00:49:27,332 --> 00:49:28,333
HE'S BEEN DOING THAT

2001
00:49:28,333 --> 00:49:29,667
PRETTY WELL, I THOUGHT.

2002
00:49:29,667 --> 00:49:31,002
>> YEAH, HE HAS.

2003
00:49:31,002 --> 00:49:32,670
>> LIKE, HE GETS PRESTON

2004
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:33,504
EVERYTHING HE NEEDS.

2005
00:49:33,504 --> 00:49:34,805
HE GETS ME EVERYTHING I NEED.

2006
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:35,973
>> I THINK IT'S ONLY FAIR

2007
00:49:35,973 --> 00:49:38,976
THAT YOU GUYS PAY, YOU KNOW,

2008
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:40,978
YOUR PORTION, YOUR SHARE.

2009
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:41,812
>> WELL...

2010
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,814
>> [passes gas]

2011
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:46,151
>> EXCUSE YOU.

2012
00:49:46,151 --> 00:49:47,318
>> YOU FEEL BETTER?

2013
00:49:47,318 --> 00:49:48,319
>> IT'S A LOT IF YOU'RE ONLY

2014
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:49,320
WORKING PART-TIME, THOUGH.

2015
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,488
>> IT IS?

2016
00:49:50,488 --> 00:49:51,489
>> AND YOU ONLY GET 20 HOURS

2017
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:52,657
A WEEK AT MINIMUM WAGE.

2018
00:49:52,657 --> 00:49:53,991
THEN IT'S A LOT.

2019
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:54,992
'CAUSE, LIKE, HE DOESN'T HAVE

2020
00:49:54,992 --> 00:49:56,794
THE SAME KIND OF JOB AS YOU DO.

2021
00:49:56,794 --> 00:49:57,662
>> I MEAN, IT'S GOING

2022
00:49:57,662 --> 00:49:58,629
TO BE TOUGH.

2023
00:49:58,629 --> 00:49:59,964
>> I DON'T EVEN THINK HE MAKES

2024
00:49:59,964 --> 00:50:02,133
THAT MUCH A MONTH.

2025
00:50:02,133 --> 00:50:03,668
>> NO, I DON'T.

2026
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:04,769
>> WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE FOR YOU

2027
00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:06,171
TO GO FULL-TIME THERE, MIKE?

2028
00:50:06,171 --> 00:50:07,172
>> THAT WOULD MEAN THAT YOU

2029
00:50:07,172 --> 00:50:08,139
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GO BACK

2030
00:50:08,139 --> 00:50:08,806
TO SCHOOL.

2031
00:50:08,806 --> 00:50:09,840
>> YEAH, IF HE DID THAT,

2032
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:10,841
I WOULDN'T GO BACK TO SCHOOL,

2033
00:50:10,841 --> 00:50:12,009
BECAUSE HE WOULD BE WORKING

2034
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,212
40-PLUS HOURS A WEEK.

2035
00:50:14,212 --> 00:50:16,214
>> IF MIKE'S GONNA STAY HERE,

2036
00:50:16,214 --> 00:50:19,450
HE NEEDS TO PAY $300 A MONTH.

2037
00:50:25,656 --> 00:50:26,824
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE MY MOM

2038
00:50:26,824 --> 00:50:28,659
IS DOING THIS.

2039
00:50:28,659 --> 00:50:29,994
IF MIKE CAN'T TAKE CARE OF

2040
00:50:29,994 --> 00:50:31,662
PRESTON LIKE WE PLANNED,

2041
00:50:31,662 --> 00:50:32,563
THERE'S NO WAY I'M GOING

2042
00:50:32,563 --> 00:50:34,299
TO GRADUATE.

2043
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:46,911
>> MIKE STARTED WORKING

2044
00:50:46,911 --> 00:50:47,845
FULL-TIME, SO HE COULD PAY

2045
00:50:47,845 --> 00:50:49,347
MY MOM THE RENT,

2046
00:50:49,347 --> 00:50:51,349
AND NOW WE ONLY HAVE $60 LEFT

2047
00:50:51,349 --> 00:50:54,619
TO BUY THINGS FOR THE BABY.

2048
00:50:54,619 --> 00:50:55,920
WHAT KIND DO WE USUALLY GET?

2049
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:56,587
PAMPERS?

2050
00:50:56,587 --> 00:50:57,722
>> PAMPERS.

2051
00:50:57,722 --> 00:50:58,556
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT

2052
00:50:58,556 --> 00:50:59,390
THE DIFFERENCE IS.

2053
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:00,791
WHICH ONE IS CHEAPER?

2054
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:02,627
THAT ONE GETS US 112 DIAPERS

2055
00:51:02,627 --> 00:51:05,630
FOR $19.79, AND THAT ONE GETS US

2056
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:08,266
92 DIAPERS FOR $19.79.

2057
00:51:08,266 --> 00:51:09,667
SO THAT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE.

2058
00:51:09,667 --> 00:51:10,335
>> YEAH.

2059
00:51:10,335 --> 00:51:11,436
>> THAT'S, LIKE, HALF OUR MONEY

2060
00:51:11,436 --> 00:51:12,337
IS GONE ALREADY...

2061
00:51:12,337 --> 00:51:13,003
>> MM-HMM.

2062
00:51:13,003 --> 00:51:14,004
>> ON DIAPERS.

2063
00:51:14,004 --> 00:51:14,805
>> SO WE NEED WHAT?

2064
00:51:14,805 --> 00:51:15,673
FORMULA AND WIPES?

2065
00:51:15,673 --> 00:51:17,342
WHICH ARE RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

2066
00:51:17,342 --> 00:51:21,011
>> SO THE SIMILAC SENSITIVE

2067
00:51:21,011 --> 00:51:22,947
IS $21.09.

2068
00:51:22,947 --> 00:51:23,948
WE CAN ONLY GET ONE RIGHT NOW,

2069
00:51:23,948 --> 00:51:25,116
'CAUSE IT'S--WE DON'T EVEN

2070
00:51:25,116 --> 00:51:26,151
HAVE ENOUGH.

2071
00:51:26,151 --> 00:51:27,118
IF WE GET THIS, WE'RE DONE.

2072
00:51:27,118 --> 00:51:28,085
WE DON'T HAVE ANY MORE MONEY.

2073
00:51:28,085 --> 00:51:29,154
IT'S $20.

2074
00:51:29,154 --> 00:51:30,488
HOW MUCH--THIS WAS $30?

2075
00:51:30,488 --> 00:51:31,322
>> MM-HMM.

2076
00:51:31,322 --> 00:51:34,125
$10, $20.

2077
00:51:34,125 --> 00:51:34,925
>> SO WE'RE DONE?

2078
00:51:34,925 --> 00:51:35,826
>> YEP.

2079
00:51:35,826 --> 00:51:37,662
>> NUH-UH.

2080
00:51:37,662 --> 00:51:39,697
[scanner beeps]

2081
00:51:39,697 --> 00:51:42,467
NOTHING IS EASY RIGHT NOW.

2082
00:51:42,467 --> 00:51:44,034
I'M EXHAUSTED FROM TAKING CARE

2083
00:51:44,034 --> 00:51:45,870
OF THE BABY BY MYSELF, AND I

2084
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:47,037
HAVEN'T DONE ANY HOMEWORK

2085
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:48,206
SINCE THE LAST TIME I SAW

2086
00:51:48,206 --> 00:51:52,377
MY HOMESCHOOL TEACHER.

2087
00:51:52,377 --> 00:51:53,511
>> SO HOW ARE YOU DOING?

2088
00:51:53,511 --> 00:51:54,679
>> PRETTY GOOD.

2089
00:51:54,679 --> 00:51:56,013
>> IT'S HARD WORK, JUGGLING

2090
00:51:56,013 --> 00:51:57,682
A BABY AND HOMEWORK, ISN'T IT?

2091
00:51:57,682 --> 00:51:59,417
>> YEAH.

2092
00:51:59,417 --> 00:52:00,751
>> AND HAS HE BEEN COOPERATING?

2093
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:01,752
>> HE'S COOPERATING NOW.

2094
00:52:01,752 --> 00:52:03,421
>> IT LOOKS LIKE HE IS, YES.

2095
00:52:03,421 --> 00:52:04,622
>> HE'S USUALLY--

2096
00:52:04,622 --> 00:52:05,490
HE GETS PRETTY FUSSY.

2097
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:06,491
LIKE, HE'LL HAVE A WHOLE DAY

2098
00:52:06,491 --> 00:52:07,792
OF JUST--HE JUST WANTS TO CRY

2099
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:08,626
ALL DAY.

2100
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:10,961
>> YEP, THAT'S WHAT BABIES DO.

2101
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,129
SO I'VE BEEN TALKING WITH

2102
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:13,464
YOUR TEACHERS, AND THEY'RE

2103
00:52:13,464 --> 00:52:14,799
A LITTLE CONCERNED, SINCE YOU'RE

2104
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:16,066
ALL THESE WEEKS BEHIND.

2105
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:16,901
>> MM-HMM.

2106
00:52:16,901 --> 00:52:18,102
>> DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING NEW

2107
00:52:18,102 --> 00:52:19,470
TO TURN IN TO ME TODAY?

2108
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,138
>> UH...NO.

2109
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:22,139
>> YEAH, I WOULD SAY,

2110
00:52:22,139 --> 00:52:23,808
DO YOUR VERY BEST TO TRY

2111
00:52:23,808 --> 00:52:25,142
AND WORK ON IT A LITTLE BIT

2112
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,811
EACH DAY, BUT IT'S GONNA BE

2113
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:27,812
A TOUGH HAUL.

2114
00:52:27,812 --> 00:52:29,146
YOU'VE GOT A LOT TO DO.

2115
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:30,147
>> MM-HMM.

2116
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:31,482
>> YOU'RE IN A UNIQUE SITUATION

2117
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:33,651
WHERE YOU NEED TO BE MOM

2118
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:34,819
AND STUDENT.

2119
00:52:34,819 --> 00:52:36,721
>> YEAH.

2120
00:52:36,721 --> 00:52:37,655
>> IT'S HARD TO DIVIDE UP

2121
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:38,623
YOUR TIME, I KNOW.

2122
00:52:38,623 --> 00:52:40,291
WHAT ABOUT COLLEGE?

2123
00:52:40,291 --> 00:52:42,460
>> [sighs] I DON'T KNOW.

2124
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:44,462
I HAVEN'T APPLIED ANYWHERE YET.

2125
00:52:44,462 --> 00:52:46,631
>> OKAY.

2126
00:52:46,631 --> 00:52:48,633
>> LIKE, I NEVER USED TO WANT

2127
00:52:48,633 --> 00:52:51,302
TO STAY HERE, BUT I DON'T REALLY

2128
00:52:51,302 --> 00:52:53,070
SEE ME GOING OFF ANYWHERE.

2129
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:54,071
>> THAT IS OPPOSITE OF WHAT

2130
00:52:54,071 --> 00:52:55,940
YOU SAID EVEN A MONTH AGO.

2131
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:57,442
>> I WAS JUST THINKING, LIKE,

2132
00:52:57,442 --> 00:52:58,443
DOESN'T IT JUST SEEM LIKE

2133
00:52:58,443 --> 00:52:59,444
A LOT EASIER TO, LIKE,

2134
00:52:59,444 --> 00:53:02,046
DROP OUT AND GET YOUR G.E.D.?

2135
00:53:02,046 --> 00:53:03,047
>> I DON'T WANT TO SEE YOU

2136
00:53:03,047 --> 00:53:04,215
DO THAT, BECAUSE I KNOW

2137
00:53:04,215 --> 00:53:05,716
YOU CAN KEEP UP.

2138
00:53:05,716 --> 00:53:07,385
I KNOW YOU HAVE WHAT IT TAKES.

2139
00:53:07,385 --> 00:53:08,219
>> YEAH.

2140
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:09,053
>> YOU'RE NOT TAKING

2141
00:53:09,053 --> 00:53:10,221
EASY CLASSES HERE, KAYLA.

2142
00:53:10,221 --> 00:53:11,922
YOU'VE GOT QUITE A LIST.

2143
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:13,591
AND I'M AFRAID THAT BY GETTING

2144
00:53:13,591 --> 00:53:14,759
YOUR G.E.D., IT WON'T SHOW

2145
00:53:14,759 --> 00:53:16,261
WHAT YOU'RE CAPABLE OF.

2146
00:53:16,261 --> 00:53:16,927
>> MM-HMM.

2147
00:53:16,927 --> 00:53:17,795
>> I KNOW YOU CAN GET

2148
00:53:17,795 --> 00:53:18,863
YOUR G.E.D.,

2149
00:53:18,863 --> 00:53:19,864
BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU

2150
00:53:19,864 --> 00:53:21,198
GRADUATE WITH YOUR CLASS.

2151
00:53:21,198 --> 00:53:22,032
I KNOW YOU HAVE IT.

2152
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:25,703
I KNOW YOU CAN DO IT.

2153
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:27,037
>> I KNEW KEEPING UP AT SCHOOL

2154
00:53:27,037 --> 00:53:29,206
WAS GOING TO BE HARD, BUT NOW

2155
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:30,841
GRADUATING WITH MY FRIENDS

2156
00:53:30,841 --> 00:53:33,110
SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE.

2157
00:53:33,110 --> 00:53:34,111
>> WHEN DO YOU PLAN ON COMING

2158
00:53:34,111 --> 00:53:34,845
BACK TO SCHOOL?

2159
00:53:34,845 --> 00:53:35,713
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW

2160
00:53:35,713 --> 00:53:36,614
IF I'M GONNA BE ABLE TO.

2161
00:53:36,614 --> 00:53:37,214
>> WHY?

2162
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:38,215
>> WELL, I JUST CAN'T AFFORD

2163
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:39,049
A DAY CARE.

2164
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:40,217
AND I KNOW, LIKE, IN THE

2165
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:41,686
LONG RUN, LIKE, IF I GRADUATED,

2166
00:53:41,686 --> 00:53:42,620
IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR HIM

2167
00:53:42,620 --> 00:53:44,689
AND FOR ME, BUT I FEEL LIKE,

2168
00:53:44,689 --> 00:53:46,190
RIGHT NOW, BEING AT HOME

2169
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:47,925
WITH HIM IS BETTER FOR HIM.

2170
00:53:47,925 --> 00:53:48,926
>> DON'T YOU PLAN ON GETTING,

2171
00:53:48,926 --> 00:53:50,595
LIKE, A JOB OR SOMETHING?

2172
00:53:50,595 --> 00:53:51,596
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE AWAY

2173
00:53:51,596 --> 00:53:52,997
FROM HIM THEN.

2174
00:53:52,997 --> 00:53:53,831
>> I DON'T KNOW.

2175
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:54,999
>> WELL, THAT'S KIND OF DUMB.

2176
00:53:54,999 --> 00:53:56,100
WE DON'T GET TO, LIKE, GRADUATE

2177
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:57,735
TOGETHER AND STUFF.

2178
00:53:57,735 --> 00:53:58,703
>> LIKE, I DON'T WANT TO BE

2179
00:53:58,703 --> 00:53:59,737
LAZY, BUT...

2180
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:00,905
>> NOT MOTIVATED TO.

2181
00:54:00,905 --> 00:54:01,939
>> YEAH, I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE

2182
00:54:01,939 --> 00:54:02,907
HIM, BUT I DON'T WANT TO GET

2183
00:54:02,907 --> 00:54:03,841
MY G.E.D., BECAUSE I FEEL

2184
00:54:03,841 --> 00:54:04,675
LIKE THAT'S NOT MUCH

2185
00:54:04,675 --> 00:54:05,543
OF AN ACCOMPLISHMENT.

2186
00:54:05,543 --> 00:54:06,477
>> HOW ARE YOU GONNA FEEL

2187
00:54:06,477 --> 00:54:08,078
STAYING HERE WITH PRESTON

2188
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:09,780
AND MIKE WHILE WE'RE OFF

2189
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:10,515
DOING COLLEGE?

2190
00:54:10,515 --> 00:54:11,449
>> WELL, THAT'LL SUCK,

2191
00:54:11,449 --> 00:54:12,950
BUT...

2192
00:54:12,950 --> 00:54:13,951
I DON'T KNOW.

2193
00:54:13,951 --> 00:54:15,653
IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN GO WITH YOU.

2194
00:54:15,653 --> 00:54:18,456
[Preston fussing]

2195
00:54:25,062 --> 00:54:26,063
>> I'M WORRIED, LIKE,

2196
00:54:26,063 --> 00:54:27,732
'CAUSE, LIKE, WE'LL ALL BE AWAY,

2197
00:54:27,732 --> 00:54:29,900
AND YOU'LL BE ALONE, AND, LIKE,

2198
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,736
WE ALWAYS ALL DO STUFF TOGETHER,

2199
00:54:31,736 --> 00:54:33,571
AND NOW IT'S JUST GONNA--

2200
00:54:33,571 --> 00:54:34,572
THEN IT'S JUST GONNA BE, LIKE,

2201
00:54:34,572 --> 00:54:36,907
STOPPED.

2202
00:54:36,907 --> 00:54:38,075
IT'S JUST GONNA BE WEIRD.

2203
00:54:38,075 --> 00:54:40,645
LIKE, IT'S SAD.

2204
00:54:47,184 --> 00:54:48,686
I HOPE WE'LL STILL, LIKE...

2205
00:54:48,686 --> 00:54:50,521
STILL KEEP IN TOUCH AND, LIKE,

00:54:50,521 --> 00:54:51,522
UPDATE EACH OTHER ON, LIKE,

00:54:55,860 --> 00:54:57,027
WE CAN JUST COME TOGETHER.

2211
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:57,828
>> SOMETHING...

2212
00:54:57,828 --> 00:54:58,829
>> IT'S NOT GONNA BE THE SAME.

2213
00:54:58,829 --> 00:55:01,098
LIKE, WE'RE GONNA PART.

2214
00:55:01,098 --> 00:55:03,868
>> I KNOW.

2215
00:55:07,104 --> 00:55:08,606
THINKING ABOUT ALL MY FRIENDS

2216
00:55:08,606 --> 00:55:10,274
GOING OFF TO COLLEGE WITHOUT ME

2217
00:55:10,274 --> 00:55:12,276
IS REALLY SAD, BUT I HAVE MORE

2218
00:55:12,276 --> 00:55:14,278
THAN MYSELF TO THINK ABOUT NOW.

2219
00:55:14,278 --> 00:55:16,447
LUCKILY, UNTIL MY FRIENDS

2220
00:55:16,447 --> 00:55:17,948
LEAVE FOR COLLEGE, WE CAN STILL

2221
00:55:17,948 --> 00:55:19,149
HAVE SLEEPOVERS.

2222
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:19,817
[clanking]

2223
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:21,652
OH!

2224
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:23,053
>> WHAT DO WE DO?

2225
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:24,054
>> I DON'T KNOW, CYNTHIA,

2226
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:25,556
AT ALL.

2227
00:55:25,556 --> 00:55:27,658
[laughter]

2228
00:55:27,658 --> 00:55:28,759
>> THERE'S POLES TO THIS THING.

2229
00:55:28,759 --> 00:55:29,560
I KNOW THAT.

2230
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:31,195
WHERE'S MIKE WHEN YOU NEED HIM?

2231
00:55:31,195 --> 00:55:32,363
>> YEAH, I ACTUALLY DON'T KNOW

2232
00:55:32,363 --> 00:55:33,398
HOW TO DO THIS AT ALL.

2233
00:55:33,398 --> 00:55:34,999
>> OH, LET'S PUSH THIS THING IN.

2234
00:55:34,999 --> 00:55:35,733
[metal clicks]

2235
00:55:35,733 --> 00:55:36,701
>> OH, WE HAVE TO LOCK THESE

2236
00:55:36,701 --> 00:55:37,301
FIRST.

2237
00:55:37,301 --> 00:55:38,403
>> OH!

2238
00:55:38,403 --> 00:55:39,737
STURDY.

2239
00:55:39,737 --> 00:55:41,305
>> HEY!

2240
00:55:41,305 --> 00:55:42,507
WE DID IT.

2241
00:55:42,507 --> 00:55:44,174
>> SO IS YOUR MOM HELPING OUT

2242
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,510
NOW THAT THE BABY IS HERE?

2243
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:46,511
>> NOT REALLY.

2244
00:55:46,511 --> 00:55:48,178
LIKE, WE'RE TO THE POINT

2245
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,079
WHERE, LIKE, I'M, LIKE,

2246
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:50,848
AFRAID TO ASK HER FOR ANYTHING.

2247
00:55:50,848 --> 00:55:52,617
LIKE, I DON'T ASK HER FOR MONEY.

2248
00:55:52,617 --> 00:55:53,518
SHE'S NEVER BOUGHTEN HIM

2249
00:55:53,518 --> 00:55:54,485
ANYTHING.

2250
00:55:54,485 --> 00:55:55,319
LIKE, I DON'T ASK HER

2251
00:55:55,319 --> 00:55:57,321
TO WATCH HIM, JUST BECAUSE

2252
00:55:57,321 --> 00:55:59,156
I DON'T--I DON'T EVEN FEEL LIKE

2253
00:55:59,156 --> 00:56:00,157
WE'RE, LIKE, CLOSE ENOUGH

2254
00:56:00,157 --> 00:56:00,958
TO EVEN DO THAT.

2255
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:01,726
IT'S JUST WEIRD.

2256
00:56:01,726 --> 00:56:02,593
OUR WHOLE RELATIONSHIP

2257
00:56:02,593 --> 00:56:03,260
IS AWKWARD.

2258
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:04,762
I DON'T--IT'S UNCOMFORTABLE.

2259
00:56:06,497 --> 00:56:08,332
LATELY, I HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN

2260
00:56:08,332 --> 00:56:09,834
MY MOM, SINCE SHE'S USUALLY

2261
00:56:09,834 --> 00:56:11,201
AT HER BOYFRIEND'S, AND IT'S

2262
00:56:11,201 --> 00:56:12,603
ALWAYS WEIRD WHEN SHE DOES

2263
00:56:12,603 --> 00:56:13,270
COME HOME.

2264
00:56:13,270 --> 00:56:14,104
>> HEY.

2265
00:56:14,104 --> 00:56:14,972
>> HI.

2266
00:56:14,972 --> 00:56:15,973
>> SO YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN

2267
00:56:15,973 --> 00:56:16,607
THINKING?

2268
00:56:16,607 --> 00:56:17,775
LIKE, SIX, EIGHT MONTHS AGO

2269
00:56:17,775 --> 00:56:19,610
WHEN I LOST SOME WEIGHT,

2270
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:20,344
REMEMBER THAT?

2271
00:56:20,344 --> 00:56:21,211
AND IF YOU'VE NOTICED,

2272
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:22,447
I'VE BEEN PUTTING IT BACK ON.

2273
00:56:22,447 --> 00:56:23,280
>> MM-HMM.

2274
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:24,782
>> SO I KNOW IN ABOUT FOUR

2275
00:56:24,782 --> 00:56:26,784
TO FIVE WEEKS, I THINK THAT'S

2276
00:56:26,784 --> 00:56:28,118
WHERE YOU'RE GONNA BE READY--

2277
00:56:28,118 --> 00:56:29,620
YOU'RE GONNA WANT TO...

2278
00:56:29,620 --> 00:56:30,621
>> PUT ON WEIGHT?

2279
00:56:30,621 --> 00:56:31,989
>> NO.

2280
00:56:31,989 --> 00:56:32,657
>> OH.

2281
00:56:32,657 --> 00:56:33,390
>> TO START...

2282
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:33,991
>> OH.

2283
00:56:33,991 --> 00:56:34,692
>> YOU KNOW?

2284
00:56:34,692 --> 00:56:35,593
>> YOU WANT ME TO GO ON

2285
00:56:35,593 --> 00:56:36,360
A DIET WITH YOU?

2286
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:37,695
>> NOT REALLY A DIET,

2287
00:56:37,695 --> 00:56:38,529
JUST START WATCHING

2288
00:56:38,529 --> 00:56:40,364
WHAT WE'RE EATING.

2289
00:56:40,364 --> 00:56:41,532
'CAUSE I KNOW, AS DETERMINED

2290
00:56:41,532 --> 00:56:43,868
AS YOU ARE, YOU COULD PROBABLY

2291
00:56:43,868 --> 00:56:45,536
DISCIPLINE ME.

2292
00:56:45,536 --> 00:56:48,205
WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THAT?

2293
00:56:48,205 --> 00:56:49,039
YOU CAN HELP ME.

2294
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:50,708
I CAN HELP YOU.

2295
00:56:50,708 --> 00:56:52,543
>> WELL, I DON'T KNOW HOW

2296
00:56:52,543 --> 00:56:54,144
I'M SUPPOSED TO HELP YOU.

2297
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:55,980
>> WELL, I MEAN, JUST WATCHING

2298
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:57,147
WHAT WE'RE EATING AROUND HERE,

2299
00:56:57,147 --> 00:56:58,082
WHERE THERE'S NOT SO MUCH

2300
00:56:58,082 --> 00:56:59,817
JUST JUNK SNACKING AND STUFF

2301
00:56:59,817 --> 00:57:00,885
LIKE THAT.

2302
00:57:00,885 --> 00:57:01,819
YOU KNOW, AND YOU MAY KNOW

2303
00:57:01,819 --> 00:57:02,787
BETTER THAN ME, CONSIDERING

2304
00:57:02,787 --> 00:57:03,721
WHAT YOU'VE GONE THROUGH

2305
00:57:03,721 --> 00:57:05,556
WITH YOUR EATING DISORDER.

2306
00:57:05,556 --> 00:57:06,491
>> YOU'RE NOT REALLY HERE

2307
00:57:06,491 --> 00:57:07,558
OFTEN ENOUGH, FOR ME TO WATCH

2308
00:57:07,558 --> 00:57:09,026
WHAT YOU'RE EATING.

2309
00:57:09,026 --> 00:57:10,528
>> WE WOULD PLAN IT WHERE

2310
00:57:10,528 --> 00:57:12,196
WE WOULD HAVE DINNER TOGETHER

2311
00:57:12,196 --> 00:57:13,197
BEFORE I LEFT.

2312
00:57:13,197 --> 00:57:14,865
>> SO YOU WOULD COME HOME

2313
00:57:14,865 --> 00:57:15,866
TO EAT WITH ME, AND THEN YOU

2314
00:57:15,866 --> 00:57:16,734
WOULD GO BACK TO YOUR

2315
00:57:16,734 --> 00:57:17,434
BOYFRIEND'S.

2316
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:18,869
>> YEAH, AFTER WE ATE.

2317
00:57:18,869 --> 00:57:19,770
YOU COULD AT LEAST THINK

2318
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:20,871
ABOUT IT.

2319
00:57:20,871 --> 00:57:22,873
>> UM, I JUST THINK WE'RE PRETTY

2320
00:57:22,873 --> 00:57:24,374
DYSFUNCTIONAL AS A FAMILY...

2321
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:25,042
>> YEAH.

2322
00:57:25,042 --> 00:57:26,043
>> THE WAY IT IS, AND I THINK

2323
00:57:26,043 --> 00:57:27,211
THAT--I DON'T KNOW.

2324
00:57:27,211 --> 00:57:28,245
IF WE'RE GONNA TAKE TIME TO DO

2325
00:57:28,245 --> 00:57:29,246
ANYTHING, WE PROBABLY NEED TO

2326
00:57:29,246 --> 00:57:32,382
TAKE TIME TO FIGURE [bleep] OUT.

2327
00:57:32,382 --> 00:57:33,884
I DIDN'T THINK THINGS COULD GET

2328
00:57:33,884 --> 00:57:35,319
ANY WORSE WITH MY MOM,

2329
00:57:35,319 --> 00:57:36,854
BUT ASKING ME TO GO ON A DIET

2330
00:57:36,854 --> 00:57:38,656
WITH HER IS A NEW LOW.

2331
00:57:56,541 --> 00:57:57,875
>> I HAVEN'T SEEN MY MOM SINCE

2332
00:57:57,875 --> 00:57:59,209
SHE ASKED ME TO GO ON A DIET

2333
00:57:59,209 --> 00:58:00,711
WITH HER, AND EVEN THOUGH

2334
00:58:00,711 --> 00:58:01,912
SHE'S CHARGING US RENT,

2335
00:58:01,912 --> 00:58:02,913
SHE'S NOT EVEN TAKING CARE

2336
00:58:02,913 --> 00:58:04,582
OF THE HOUSE.

2337
00:58:04,582 --> 00:58:05,249
>> HI, MOM.

2338
00:58:05,249 --> 00:58:07,251
I WAS JUST--I WAS JUST GONNA

2339
00:58:07,251 --> 00:58:08,252
TELL YOU THAT I DON'T THINK

2340
00:58:08,252 --> 00:58:09,820
THE HEAT IS WORKING.

2341
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:12,156
SO CALL ME BACK WHEN YOU CAN.

2342
00:58:12,156 --> 00:58:14,024
BYE.

2343
00:58:14,024 --> 00:58:15,025
IT'S FREEZING IN HERE, AND

2344
00:58:15,025 --> 00:58:16,694
MY MOM IS AT HER BOYFRIEND'S,

2345
00:58:16,694 --> 00:58:18,195
SO WE'RE GOING TO A HOTEL

2346
00:58:18,195 --> 00:58:19,196
FOR THE NIGHT.

2347
00:58:19,196 --> 00:58:21,532
IT COST $100, AND WE CAN BARELY

2348
00:58:21,532 --> 00:58:23,568
AFFORD DIAPERS AND FORMULA.

2349
00:58:23,568 --> 00:58:24,569
WELL, SO NOW WE JUST HAVE TO

2350
00:58:24,569 --> 00:58:25,670
WORRY ABOUT HOW THE HELL YOU'RE

2351
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:27,071
GONNA PAY RENT, WHEN WE JUST

2352
00:58:27,071 --> 00:58:28,072
SPENT ALL THAT MONEY ON THAT

2353
00:58:28,072 --> 00:58:29,073
STUPID HOTEL.

2354
00:58:29,073 --> 00:58:30,240
>> YEAH, WE SHOULDN'T HAVE GONE

2355
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,475
TO A HOTEL.

2356
00:58:31,475 --> 00:58:32,409
>> NO, SERIOUSLY, THOUGH,

2357
00:58:32,409 --> 00:58:34,078
HOW ARE YOU GONNA PAY RENT?

2358
00:58:34,078 --> 00:58:35,780
>> I DON'T KNOW.

2359
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:37,047
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S FAIR

2360
00:58:37,047 --> 00:58:38,883
HOW MY MOM IS TREATING US,

2361
00:58:38,883 --> 00:58:40,050
SO I ASKED HER TO MEET ME,

2362
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:41,451
SO WE CAN TALK ABOUT IT.

2363
00:58:41,451 --> 00:58:42,452
>> HOW ARE YOU?

2364
00:58:42,452 --> 00:58:44,221
>> GOOD.

2365
00:58:44,221 --> 00:58:45,823
>> DECIDE ABOUT SCHOOL YET?

2366
00:58:45,823 --> 00:58:46,591
>> I DON'T KNOW.

2367
00:58:46,591 --> 00:58:49,660
I WANT TO GRADUATE, BUT...

2368
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:51,896
>> SO WHAT ELSE IS NEW?

2369
00:58:51,896 --> 00:58:52,730
>> I DON'T KNOW.

2370
00:58:52,730 --> 00:58:56,066
I JUST--WE DON'T LIKE LIVING

2371
00:58:56,066 --> 00:58:56,801
AT YOUR HOUSE.

2372
00:58:56,801 --> 00:58:58,736
LIKE, WE FEEL THERE'S NO POINT

2373
00:58:58,736 --> 00:58:59,737
FOR US LIVING THERE.

2374
00:58:59,737 --> 00:59:00,805
WE'RE JUST KIND OF THROWING AWAY

2375
00:59:00,805 --> 00:59:01,706
MONEY THAT COULD BE USED

2376
00:59:01,706 --> 00:59:02,740
FOR SOMETHING BETTER,

2377
00:59:02,740 --> 00:59:04,408
LIKE TOWARDS, LIKE, A SAVINGS

2378
00:59:04,408 --> 00:59:06,243
FOR OUR OWN PLACE OR SOMETHING.

2379
00:59:06,243 --> 00:59:07,244
I JUST FEEL LIKE WE'RE WASTING

2380
00:59:07,244 --> 00:59:08,345
MONEY, WHEN WE SHOULDN'T EVEN

2381
00:59:08,345 --> 00:59:09,179
HAVE TO PAY.

2382
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:11,015
LIKE, SPECIFICALLY, LIKE,

2383
00:59:11,015 --> 00:59:12,016
THE HEAT GOES OUT, AND YOU'RE

2384
00:59:12,016 --> 00:59:13,183
AT YOUR BOYFRIEND'S HOUSE,

2385
00:59:13,183 --> 00:59:14,218
AND WE HAVE TO GET A HOTEL ROOM.

2386
00:59:14,218 --> 00:59:15,152
THEN I HAVE TO PAY FOR IT

2387
00:59:15,152 --> 00:59:16,186
ENTIRELY BY MYSELF, BUT YOU'RE

2388
00:59:16,186 --> 00:59:17,121
ALL NICE AND WARM IN YOUR

2389
00:59:17,121 --> 00:59:18,222
BOYFRIEND'S HOUSE, SO IT WASN'T

2390
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:19,556
THAT BIG OF A CONCERN TO YOU.

2391
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:20,490
>> YOU THINK YOU GUYS CAN

2392
00:59:20,490 --> 00:59:21,425
MAKE IT ON YOUR OWN?

2393
00:59:21,425 --> 00:59:22,359
>> I DON'T KNOW. I JUST--

2394
00:59:22,359 --> 00:59:23,260
>> WELL, I MEAN, KAYLA,

2395
00:59:23,260 --> 00:59:24,161
IF YOU CAN DO ALL THIS,

2396
00:59:24,161 --> 00:59:25,395
IF YOU CAN MOVE OUT OF THE

2397
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,897
HOUSE, AND YOU AND MIKE MAKE IT

2398
00:59:26,897 --> 00:59:28,065
ON YOUR OWN WITH PRESTON,

2399
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:29,433
THEN DO IT.

2400
00:59:29,433 --> 00:59:31,301
>> I JUST FELT LIKE WHEN I FIRST

2401
00:59:31,301 --> 00:59:33,838
GOT PREGNANT, YOU'D TELL ME HOW

2402
00:59:33,838 --> 00:59:34,772
GOOD THINGS WERE GONNA BE

2403
00:59:34,772 --> 00:59:36,674
AND HOW, LIKE, HOW MUCH YOU WERE

2404
00:59:36,674 --> 00:59:37,842
GONNA HELP OUT AND STUFF,

2405
00:59:37,842 --> 00:59:40,177
AND IT JUST SEEMS LIKE

2406
00:59:40,177 --> 00:59:41,812
YOU HAVEN'T.

2407
00:59:41,812 --> 00:59:42,980
>> I'VE TRIED.

2408
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:43,914
>> WELL, I JUST FEEL LIKE

2409
00:59:43,914 --> 00:59:44,982
YOU JUST DISTANCE YOURSELF,

2410
00:59:44,982 --> 00:59:46,150
AND YOU DON'T EVER WANT TO BE

2411
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:47,685
AROUND ME UNLESS--

2412
00:59:47,685 --> 00:59:48,853
>> THAT'S NOT TRUE.

2413
00:59:48,853 --> 00:59:49,687
>> I DON'T KNOW.

2414
00:59:49,687 --> 00:59:50,621
I JUST FEEL LIKE YOU MADE

2415
00:59:50,621 --> 00:59:52,356
A LOT OF PROMISES THAT AREN'T

2416
00:59:52,356 --> 00:59:53,590
BEING KEPT.

2417
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,092
>> WELL, I TRIED.

2418
00:59:55,092 --> 00:59:57,561
THAT'S ALL I CAN SAY.

2419
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:01,098
>> [sighs]

2420
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:02,132
YOU WERE, LIKE, MY BEST FRIEND

2421
01:00:02,132 --> 01:00:04,101
BEFORE I GOT PREGNANT,

2422
01:00:04,101 --> 01:00:05,102
AND NOW I FEEL LIKE YOU CAN'T

2423
01:00:05,102 --> 01:00:07,071
EVEN STAND TO BE AROUND ME.

2424
01:00:07,071 --> 01:00:08,405
[sniffles]

2425
01:00:08,405 --> 01:00:09,740
I JUST WANT THINGS TO GO BACK

2426
01:00:09,740 --> 01:00:12,209
TO THE WAY THEY USED TO BE.

2427
01:00:12,209 --> 01:00:13,377
[sniffles]

2428
01:00:13,377 --> 01:00:15,179
>> YEAH.

2429
01:00:22,519 --> 01:00:23,854
>> I THOUGHT SINCE MY MOM WAS

2430
01:00:23,854 --> 01:00:26,023
A TEEN MOM THAT SHE WOULD STICK

2431
01:00:26,023 --> 01:00:27,191
BY ME THROUGH THIS WHOLE THING

2432
01:00:27,191 --> 01:00:28,525
AND SHE WOULD BE, LIKE,

2433
01:00:28,525 --> 01:00:29,827
MY BIGGEST SUPPORT SYSTEM,

2434
01:00:29,827 --> 01:00:31,662
BUT NOW I JUST FEEL COMPLETELY

2435
01:00:31,662 --> 01:00:33,463
ABANDONED BY HER.

2436
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:34,799
YOU'RE SO TINY FOR YOUR FIRST

2437
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:36,300
THANKSGIVING.

2438
01:00:36,300 --> 01:00:37,167
>> SO ARE YOU MAD THAT

2439
01:00:37,167 --> 01:00:38,202
YOUR MOM IS NOT AROUND?

2440
01:00:38,202 --> 01:00:40,170
>> I DON'T REALLY CARE ANYMORE.

2441
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:41,171
IF IT WASN'T FOR MIKE,

2442
01:00:41,171 --> 01:00:43,507
I'M NOT SURE WHERE I WOULD BE.

2443
01:00:43,507 --> 01:00:45,009
I DEPEND ON HIM AND RELY ON HIM

2444
01:00:45,009 --> 01:00:47,011
FOR A LOT OF THINGS, AND I JUST

2445
01:00:47,011 --> 01:00:48,278
HOPE THAT WE'RE TOGETHER

2446
01:00:48,278 --> 01:00:49,279
FOREVER.

2447
01:00:49,279 --> 01:00:50,614
WHOO!

2448
01:00:50,614 --> 01:00:51,816
THAT WAS BETTER.

2449
01:00:51,816 --> 01:00:53,150
WITH AN EATING DISORDER, BEING

2450
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,351
PREGNANT WAS REALLY DIFFICULT,

2451
01:00:54,351 --> 01:00:55,519
AND I HAVE MY GOOD DAYS

2452
01:00:55,519 --> 01:00:56,520
AND MY BAD DAYS.

2453
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:59,523
SOME DAYS I JUST SEE FLAB

2454
01:00:59,523 --> 01:01:01,525
AND DISGUSTING FAT.

2455
01:01:01,525 --> 01:01:02,592
OTHER DAYS, I LOOK IN THE

2456
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:03,928
MIRROR, AND I GO,

2457
01:01:03,928 --> 01:01:05,529
"THIS IS A GOOD DAY,

2458
01:01:05,529 --> 01:01:07,031
AND I FEEL GOOD ABOUT MYSELF."

2459
01:01:07,031 --> 01:01:08,032
BASICALLY, BEING PREGNANT

2460
01:01:08,032 --> 01:01:09,867
HAS CHANGED MY WHOLE LIFE.

2461
01:01:09,867 --> 01:01:11,702
I THOUGHT I WOULD GRADUATE WITH

2462
01:01:11,702 --> 01:01:13,037
MY FRIENDS AND GO OFF TO COLLEGE

2463
01:01:13,037 --> 01:01:15,672
TO BE A NURSE, AND NOW I'M

2464
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:17,174
SITTING AT HOME ALL DAY

2465
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:19,744
WITH THE BABY, AND IT'S JUST

2466
01:01:19,744 --> 01:01:20,745
NOTHING HOW I EVER EXPECTED

2467
01:01:20,745 --> 01:01:22,379
MY LIFE WOULD GO AT ALL.

2468
01:01:22,379 --> 01:01:23,247
YOU'RE JUST GONNA BE

2469
01:01:23,247 --> 01:01:24,048
A PAIN IN MY BUTT.

2470
01:01:24,048 --> 01:01:25,049
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME HOLD YOU

2471
01:01:25,049 --> 01:01:25,750
ALL DAY LONG.

2472
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:26,717
IT SUCKS THAT I JUST KIND OF

2473
01:01:26,717 --> 01:01:28,786
WATCHED MYSELF FALL BEHIND,

2474
01:01:28,786 --> 01:01:29,954
AND NOW IT'S JUST, LIKE...

2475
01:01:29,954 --> 01:01:30,988
SLOWLY, EVERYTHING WAS JUST

2476
01:01:30,988 --> 01:01:32,422
KIND OF FALLING APART,

2477
01:01:32,422 --> 01:01:34,058
AND I COULDN'T KEEP EVERYTHING

2478
01:01:34,058 --> 01:01:35,059
TOGETHER ANYMORE.

2479
01:01:35,059 --> 01:01:36,093
>> YOU THINK YOU'RE ON TRACK

2480
01:01:36,093 --> 01:01:37,561
TO GRADUATE THIS SPRING?

2481
01:01:37,561 --> 01:01:39,063
>> NO.

2482
01:01:39,063 --> 01:01:39,897
>> NO?

2483
01:01:39,897 --> 01:01:41,832
>> I'M, LIKE, A MONTH BEHIND.

2484
01:01:41,832 --> 01:01:43,868
YOU CAN'T LOOK AT YOUR CHILD

2485
01:01:43,868 --> 01:01:44,735
AND THEN SAY, "I WISH

2486
01:01:44,735 --> 01:01:45,870
YOU WEREN'T HERE."

2487
01:01:45,870 --> 01:01:50,207
I WISH IT WASN'T LIKE THIS.

2488
01:01:50,207 --> 01:01:51,375
I WANT PRESTON TO KNOW THAT

2489
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:53,243
I'LL NEVER ABANDON HIM.

2490
01:01:53,243 --> 01:01:54,578
HE FULLY DEPENDS ON ME,

2491
01:01:54,578 --> 01:01:56,246
AND I NEED TO BE STRONG FOR HIM

2492
01:01:56,246 --> 01:01:57,247
ALL THE TIME.

2493
01:01:57,247 --> 01:01:59,917
YOUR CRY IS SO CUTE.

2494
01:01:59,917 --> 01:02:01,418
IT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE ME MAD,

2495
01:02:01,418 --> 01:02:03,788
'CAUSE IT'S SO ADORABLE.

2496
01:02:03,788 --> 01:02:05,289
HOPEFULLY, I CAN TAKE ALL

2497
01:02:05,289 --> 01:02:07,291
MY DREAMS ONE STEP AT A TIME

2498
01:02:07,291 --> 01:02:08,558
AND JUST SLOWLY GET TO WHERE

2499
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:10,360
I WANT TO BE IN LIFE.
