00:07:02,974 --> 00:07:05,459
- Are you guys still thinking
about the adoption thing?

173
00:07:05,563 --> 00:07:06,805
- Yeah.

174
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:09,739
Been a lot harder for me
than I thought it was gonna be.

175
00:07:09,843 --> 00:07:11,051
- Yeah.

176
00:07:11,154 --> 00:07:15,055
- You know, like,
actually deciding to do it

177
00:07:15,158 --> 00:07:17,747
has been harder.

178
00:07:17,851 --> 00:07:20,681
- You think you're gonna end up
going through with it?

179
00:07:20,785 --> 00:07:21,889
- Oh, yeah.

180
00:07:21,993 --> 00:07:23,235
Especially--for sure.

181
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:25,375
- Once you actually hold it--
- I'm not holding her.

182
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:26,825
I don't want to hold her.

183
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:28,758
- I'm holding that baby when
it comes out of your [bleep].

184
00:07:28,862 --> 00:07:30,242
- I want to too.

185
00:07:30,346 --> 00:07:32,313
[laughter]
- I know it's the best thing,

186
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:33,694
so I don't want to be selfish.

187
00:07:33,798 --> 00:07:35,282
I don't want to hold her
and be, like, "Oh, I want you."

188
00:07:35,385 --> 00:07:36,801
- This is the best thing,
though.

189
00:07:36,904 --> 00:07:38,699
- But you should hold her--
- Could you imagine if we

190
00:07:38,803 --> 00:07:40,805
kept her, how screwed up
that baby would be?

191
00:07:40,908 --> 00:07:42,600
And, like, I talked--
I talked to everybody,

192
00:07:42,703 --> 00:07:44,429
and they're, like, "Dude,
if I got pregnant right now,

193
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:45,465
I would just get an abortion."

194
00:07:45,568 --> 00:07:47,743
- I would.
I'm telling you right now.

195
00:07:47,846 --> 00:07:49,123
And I wouldn't have the strength
to give it away like you guys.

196
00:07:49,227 --> 00:07:52,851
- Yeah.

197
00:07:52,955 --> 00:07:55,336
- How many family profile books
did Dawn give you?

198
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,063
- There's ten of them.

199
00:07:58,167 --> 00:07:59,824
Just gonna pick one.

200
00:07:59,927 --> 00:08:01,619
- "Left is our
current family."

201
00:08:01,722 --> 00:08:02,965
- Mm-hmm.

202
00:08:03,068 --> 00:08:04,725
Yeah, but see, we don't want
anybody with kids, though,

203
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:08,073
unless they're adopted.

204
00:08:08,177 --> 00:08:09,903
- They're older, I think.

205
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:13,803
So this is the family that

206
00:08:13,907 --> 00:08:14,770
I really like.

207
00:08:14,873 --> 00:08:16,530
- [together] Brandon
and Teresa.

208
00:08:16,634 --> 00:08:19,188
- She's skiing,
or whatever it's called.

209
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,466
- Water-skiiing?
- Water-skiing.

210
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,813
- I think it's good for our
daughter to have a stay-at-home

211
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:26,471
mom too, so that way, like,
she's not always in day care.

212
00:08:26,575 --> 00:08:29,094
- I want--I want the dad to be
definitely college-educated.

213
00:08:29,198 --> 00:08:30,579
Bachelor's, master's, whatever.

214
00:08:30,682 --> 00:08:32,477
As long as he graduated
from college.

215
00:08:32,581 --> 00:08:35,169
- Yeah.

216
00:08:35,273 --> 00:08:36,239
- Oh, yeah, husband.

217
00:08:36,343 --> 00:08:37,793
He's a financial planner.

218
00:08:37,896 --> 00:08:38,690
- So what's that?

219
00:08:38,794 --> 00:08:40,071
I don't even know what that is.

220
00:08:40,174 --> 00:08:41,555
- And this would be a good--
really good family, I think.

221
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:42,936
- I know, I really like them.

222
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,178
- I like these people.

223
00:08:44,282 --> 00:08:45,386
- Look at that house.

224
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,734
- It's a nice house.

225
00:08:47,837 --> 00:08:49,908
- So what do you think we're
gonna tell dawn next time

226
00:08:50,012 --> 00:08:51,116
we go in there?

227
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,808
- We looked at some of them,
and we read them.

228
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:55,258
And--but nobody really
sticks out like they do.

229
00:08:55,362 --> 00:08:58,020
- I think the same way, so...

230
00:09:01,506 --> 00:09:04,095
With our family selected,
we made another appointment

231
00:09:04,198 --> 00:09:07,650
to see Dawn, something Butch
wasn't too happy about.

232
00:09:07,754 --> 00:09:09,756
- Where do you think
it's gonna be better off?

233
00:09:09,859 --> 00:09:11,861
Not with your own natural
parents?

234
00:09:11,965 --> 00:09:13,035
- Because we can't.

235
00:09:13,138 --> 00:09:14,657
- I don't understand.
I mean, material-wise?

236
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:16,245
- Both: No.

237
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,211
- Emotionally-wise.

238
00:09:17,315 --> 00:09:18,419
- Emotional, stable.

239
00:09:18,523 --> 00:09:21,146
- Stable household.
A stable household.

240
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,562
- So it's not moving
all the time.

241
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:24,460
- Stable house--you make that.
That's your choice.

242
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,151
- Ha.
- Ha?

243
00:09:26,255 --> 00:09:27,256
- How about so we keep
the baby?

244
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,360
Okay, so we keep the baby.

245
00:09:28,464 --> 00:09:29,914
Six months from now,
we get it here.

246
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:32,537
Okay, the crib's in Catelynn's
small little room.

247
00:09:32,641 --> 00:09:33,538
- Oh, it ain't good enough?

248
00:09:33,642 --> 00:09:35,022
- No, you're absolutely right.

249
00:09:35,126 --> 00:09:35,954
It's not good enough.

250
00:09:36,058 --> 00:09:37,197
Not good enough for my kid.

251
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,336

Not good enough for my kid.

252
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:41,132
My kid deserves way better
than this.

253
00:09:41,235 --> 00:09:42,547
Way better.
- Okay.

254
00:09:42,651 --> 00:09:43,513
- You're absolutely right.

255
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:44,514
Not good enough for my kid.

256
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:46,724
- Okay, I see what you're
saying.

257
00:09:46,827 --> 00:09:48,449
All that baby needs is love.

258
00:09:48,553 --> 00:09:51,004
- No, that's not all a baby
needs is love, Dad.

259
00:09:51,107 --> 00:09:52,695
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

260
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,179
- I gave you the role model.

261
00:09:54,283 --> 00:09:55,422
- You gave me a role model?

262
00:09:55,525 --> 00:09:56,975
You weren't even in my life
for my whole life.

263
00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:58,839
What are you talking about,
"Gave me a role model?"

264
00:09:58,943 --> 00:10:00,600
you made a stupid choice,
and you were in prison.

265
00:10:00,703 --> 00:10:01,946
- Give the kid some love, man.

266
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:04,500
- And it's gonna have plenty
of love in the house that

267
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,502
it's going to. Plenty of it.

268
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,055
- Screw that house,
that wherever it's going.

269
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:10,886
- Yeah. Screw this house.

270
00:10:14,544 --> 00:10:22,967
[peaceful guitar music]
♪ 

271
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,313
- I love you.

272
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,659
- I love you too.

273
00:10:25,763 --> 00:10:28,075
- Despite our parents'
disapproval, Dawn came over

274
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:30,526
to Tyler's house because we're
ready to move forward with

275
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,976
the adoption plan.

276
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,944
- So you took home a whole
bunch of profile books, right?

277
00:10:35,048 --> 00:10:36,152
- Yeah.

278
00:10:36,256 --> 00:10:37,360
- And did you get a chance
to look them over?

279
00:10:37,464 --> 00:10:38,638
- Yep, we did.

280
00:10:38,741 --> 00:10:41,641
- Okay, did anything stand out
to you in them?

281
00:10:41,744 --> 00:10:43,159
- [together] Brandon
and Teresa.

282
00:10:43,263 --> 00:10:44,574
- Brandon and Teresa.

283
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:48,578
Okay, what about them stands out
as "the right family

284
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:49,994
for our baby?"

285
00:10:50,097 --> 00:10:51,961
- Well, pretty much, I just
like everything about them.

286
00:10:52,065 --> 00:10:53,825
Everything that I wanted,
they have, pretty much.

287
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:55,413
She's gonna be
a stay-at-home mom.

288
00:10:55,516 --> 00:10:57,035
- Yeah.
- All right.

289
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:59,175
- And the dad's gonna be
the provider.

290
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,419
Like, in my heart it was, like,
a feeling that you just get.

291
00:11:01,522 --> 00:11:02,938
Like, it's, like,
these are the people.

292
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:07,011
- So when's the soonest
that we can meet these people?

293
00:11:07,114 --> 00:11:08,875
- Well, I--you know,
they have to book a flight,

294
00:11:08,978 --> 00:11:12,706
so probably within a week or
two, we can do that.

295
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,294
If you guys are up for it.

296
00:11:14,397 --> 00:11:15,813
- Okay.
- Oh, I'm up for it.

297
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,436
- When we get to the adoptive
family meeting, we talk about

298
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:21,266
exactly what you'd like to see
happen at the hospital.

299
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,578
- Okay.

300
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,924
- And, Catelynn, a lot of that
is up to you.

301
00:11:24,028 --> 00:11:27,307
When the baby is born,
do I want immediate contact with

302
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,722
the baby in the delivery room?

303
00:11:28,826 --> 00:11:30,379
And you're shaking your head,
"No, I don't."

304
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:33,934
so you've thought about it
a little bit. That's good.

305
00:11:34,038 --> 00:11:35,384
- Yeah, I already know,
actually, what I want to do.

306
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,041
If I were to, like, even see
her, I'd get already attached,

307
00:11:37,144 --> 00:11:38,801
be like, "No, I'm taking her
home with me."

308
00:11:38,905 --> 00:11:41,148
I'd think I'd get really selfish
at that moment.

309
00:11:41,252 --> 00:11:42,943
- I will tell you.

310
00:11:43,047 --> 00:11:47,361
I have never had somebody regret
doing a hello and a good-bye.

311
00:11:47,465 --> 00:11:48,777
- Yeah.

312
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,952
- And that is--that's a moment
that you can't recapture

313
00:11:52,056 --> 00:11:53,920
later on.

314
00:11:54,023 --> 00:11:57,233
And so it's something you want
to think about.

315
00:11:57,337 --> 00:11:58,303
- Makes me want to cry.

316
00:11:58,407 --> 00:12:00,098
- It does?
- Yeah.

317
00:12:00,202 --> 00:12:02,100
- What part of it makes you
want to cry?

318
00:12:02,204 --> 00:12:03,239
- I don't know.

319
00:12:03,343 --> 00:12:05,276
- Aw.

320
00:12:12,214 --> 00:12:15,182
- This is going to be harder
than I thought.

321
00:12:22,707 --> 00:12:25,468
- Because it's harder to move
around these days, I'm trying

322
00:12:25,572 --> 00:12:28,057
to keep up with school from
home, but I never thought

323
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:30,542
schoolwork would be the least
of my worries.

324
00:12:30,646 --> 00:12:33,476
My mom knows I'm going forward
with the adoption,

325
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,720
but she's been dropping
not-so-subtle hints that she

326
00:12:35,824 --> 00:12:38,688
wants me to change my mind:
bringing baby clothes home

327
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:41,105
and even buying a bassinet.

328
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:46,766
- 'Cause I think you'd be
a good mom.

329
00:12:46,869 --> 00:12:49,078
- Mm-hmm.

330
00:12:49,182 --> 00:12:50,839
- Me and Butch would help you.

331
00:12:50,942 --> 00:12:53,186
- Yeah.

332
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:54,912
- It's my first grandbaby.

333
00:12:55,015 --> 00:12:56,258
I already love her.

334
00:12:56,361 --> 00:12:58,536
- Mm-hmm, well, yeah,
you love her.

335
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,503
- Well, I'm always gonna
be thinking about her.

336
00:13:00,607 --> 00:13:02,160
And I think it will bug you.

337
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:03,265
- You think it will bug me?

338
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:05,232
- Mm-hmm.

339
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:13,827
- Scared 'cause if I keep her,
you know, and then I'm scared

340
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:15,139
if I give her away.

341
00:13:15,242 --> 00:13:18,590
I'm scared of, like,

How do you think you're gonna
feel then?

344
00:13:22,732 --> 00:13:24,044
- Yeah.

345
00:13:24,148 --> 00:13:27,530
I don't know what to expect,
honestly.

346
00:13:27,634 --> 00:13:28,635
- It's your decision.

347
00:13:28,738 --> 00:13:32,604
You're the one that has to live
with it.

348
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,469
And you still got time
to change your mind.

349
00:13:35,573 --> 00:13:39,370
- Yeah, I know.

350
00:13:39,473 --> 00:13:42,373
Only nine weeks away from
my due date, my mom is taking me

351
00:13:42,476 --> 00:13:45,548
to get a sonogram to check
the baby's growth and position.

352
00:13:45,652 --> 00:13:48,310
I think she hopes it's going
to make me change my mind.

353
00:13:48,413 --> 00:13:50,105
- Catelynn, do you know
what you're having already?

354
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,314
- Yep, it's a girl.
- Okay.

355
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:54,695
I'm gonna bring this up,
and we're gonna put warm gel

on your belly.

357
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,666

359

- Mm-hmm.

360
00:14:02,462 --> 00:14:03,808
- Okay, now we're gonna try
and get a little bit

361

of the face.

362

right here.

365
00:14:08,295 --> 00:14:09,607
- She looks like you, Tyler.

366
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,574

blocking her.

368
00:14:15,095 --> 00:14:18,167
- Look at whose nose she's got.

369
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:19,479
- She's definitely got my chin.

370
00:14:19,582 --> 00:14:21,412

- [giggles]
- You can sit there.

You guys have a seat here.

to meet you guys.

- The buildup to this, I mean,
we've been hearing about y'all

429
00:16:36,857 --> 00:16:38,790
for the last few weeks.
Just time to meet.

430
00:16:38,894 --> 00:16:40,240
Just time to get in front
of you, say hello.

431
00:16:40,344 --> 00:16:41,483
So we're glad to be here.

432

- What--how many weeks are you
now, Catelynn?

433
00:16:43,485 --> 00:16:44,900
- 31.
- Yep, 31 weeks.

434
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,936
- So we have nine weeks
till d-day.

435
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,629
So we're just gonna spend some
time getting to know each other.

436
00:16:49,732 --> 00:16:53,564
And I'll just ask questions
and put you all on the hot seat.

437
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:55,290
Brandon, tell us how you guys
met each other.

438
00:16:55,393 --> 00:16:58,638
- Teresa and I met, actually,
at church in our hometown.

439
00:16:58,741 --> 00:17:00,640
Some mutual friends
introduced us.

440
00:17:00,743 --> 00:17:03,125
- What do you guys do
for work, for employment?

441
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:05,679
- I work for a small
financial services company.

442
00:17:05,783 --> 00:17:08,475
- And I work for a private
Christian school.

443
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:11,202
- So what brought you to
an adoption decision?

444
00:17:11,306 --> 00:17:13,480
- When we got married,
we started trying to have

445
00:17:13,584 --> 00:17:16,414
children, and, um,
just have not been able

446
00:17:16,518 --> 00:17:17,898
to have children.

447
00:17:18,002 --> 00:17:21,661
And so I have just felt for
several years that there's

448
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:23,663
a child that we're gonna have
through adoption,

449
00:17:23,766 --> 00:17:25,803
and that's the right plan
for us.

450
00:17:25,906 --> 00:17:28,254
- So I wanted you guys
to kind of tell them too

451
00:17:28,357 --> 00:17:32,085
what you're thinking in terms
of, you know, pictures and

452
00:17:32,189 --> 00:17:34,881
letters and kind of updates
and getting information.

453
00:17:34,984 --> 00:17:36,986
- Personally, I want to be able
to, like, you know, like,

454
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,437
send her birthday presents,
'cause I will do that

455
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:40,611
every year.

456
00:17:40,714 --> 00:17:41,819
I'd be, like,
"Got to go shopping.

457
00:17:41,922 --> 00:17:43,717
Got to go get something
for her."

458
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:45,305
I want her to know that
I'm still there.

459
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:48,205
Like, I didn't just, like,
not care about her, like--

460
00:17:48,308 --> 00:17:49,758
- It makes sense.

461
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,104
I think having correspondence,
interaction, certainly pictures,

462
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,141
and kind of whatever we can do,
it makes all the sense

463
00:17:53,244 --> 00:17:54,590
in the world.

464
00:17:54,694 --> 00:17:57,800
- I have a feeling we would
take tons and tons of pictures.

465
00:17:57,904 --> 00:17:59,733
- What are your goals, then?

466
00:17:59,837 --> 00:18:02,219
What kind of things are you
looking towards in the future?

467
00:18:02,322 --> 00:18:04,911
- I really want my daughter to,
like, live in a household where

468
00:18:05,014 --> 00:18:07,293
she's raised in a household
and she's not moving

469
00:18:07,396 --> 00:18:08,742
like I've moved my whole life.

470
00:18:08,846 --> 00:18:10,951
Like, I don't really have, like,
a really good, stable household.

471
00:18:11,055 --> 00:18:15,404
Like, my mom, she used to have
problems, and I had, um--

472
00:18:15,508 --> 00:18:17,337
I had to live, like,
go move in with my grandparents

473
00:18:17,441 --> 00:18:19,374
and live with them for
seven months 'cause I couldn't

474
00:18:19,477 --> 00:18:20,582
live where I was living.

475
00:18:20,685 --> 00:18:23,412
And, um, sorry.
- It's okay.

476
00:18:23,516 --> 00:18:24,344
- And, um...

477
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:25,345
[sighs]

478
00:18:28,969 --> 00:18:31,972
I just want her to have better
than what I had,

479
00:18:32,076 --> 00:18:35,873
and I know that I can't do that.

480
00:18:35,976 --> 00:18:40,084
So I'm just doing the thing
that I think is the best.

481
00:18:40,188 --> 00:18:42,569
And I know that you guys
can provide for her a lot more

482
00:18:42,673 --> 00:18:44,468
than I can.

483
00:18:44,571 --> 00:18:47,988
So I don't know.

484
00:18:48,092 --> 00:18:49,058
- It's okay.

486
00:18:59,379 --> 00:19:01,657
- After our meeting with
Brandon and Teresa,

487
00:19:01,761 --> 00:19:02,865
Dawn wanted to see how we felt.

488
00:19:02,969 --> 00:19:05,144
- So how did you feel?

489
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:06,145
- I feel like I know them.

490
00:19:06,248 --> 00:19:07,767
- They're gonna be awesome
parents.

491
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,769
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, they are.

492
00:19:09,872 --> 00:19:11,322
- And I just loved that too,
like, right when I came in here,

493
00:19:11,426 --> 00:19:14,946

so tight, like, she's, like--

495
00:19:16,431 --> 00:19:17,535
You can just tell.

496
00:19:17,639 --> 00:19:18,916
- Okay, well, good.

497
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:21,229
We'll consider it an official
match, and we'll just keep

498

moving forward.

499
00:19:22,989 --> 00:19:24,335
- Mm-hmm. Definitely.

500
00:19:24,439 --> 00:19:26,337

503
00:19:35,381 --> 00:19:37,245
Hello, mother.

504
00:19:40,248 --> 00:19:44,079
- Um, I went to go meet
the parents.

505
00:19:45,908 --> 00:19:49,153
- Oh, well, I thought I already
told--

506
00:19:51,638 --> 00:19:53,122
Bye.
- Bye.

507
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:54,262
- What did she say?

508
00:19:54,365 --> 00:19:55,401
- Nothing.

509
00:19:55,504 --> 00:19:56,643
She goes--she goes,
"You didn't even tell me

510
00:19:56,747 --> 00:19:58,197
that you were going to meet
the parents today.

Thanks for bringing me."

00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:00,613
- Yes, you did.

513
00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:03,512
- And obviously, I didn't.

514
00:20:03,616 --> 00:20:06,446
It sucks not having my mom
on my side.

515
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:10,485
I just hope she comes around
before the baby is born.

516
00:20:10,588 --> 00:20:13,004
Over the next few weeks,
I tried to focus on

517
00:20:13,108 --> 00:20:14,385
the good things.

518
00:20:14,489 --> 00:20:16,456
Tyler and I spent more time
getting to know Brandon

519
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,630
and Teresa.

520
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:19,045
- Good to see you guys.
- It's been forever.

521
00:20:19,148 --> 00:20:20,322
- I know. I know.

522
00:20:20,426 --> 00:20:21,910
- They picked out a name
that we like: Carolyn,

523
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:23,256
Carly, for short.

524
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,533
We sewed a baby blanket.

525
00:20:24,637 --> 00:20:25,534
- Too cute. Love it.

526
00:20:25,638 --> 00:20:26,570
- That is really cute.

527
00:20:26,673 --> 00:20:27,985
- And made a scrapbook
for the baby.

528
00:20:28,088 --> 00:20:29,918
- Yeah, I think it's important
for her to be able to, like,

529
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:32,645
see what we look like, and--
- What everybody looks like.

530
00:20:32,748 --> 00:20:35,441
Before I knew it, my due date
was around the corner,

531
00:20:35,544 --> 00:20:38,237
and to my total surprise,
I went to the doctor,

532
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:42,551
and she told me she would
induce labor in three days.

533
00:20:42,655 --> 00:20:45,520
[phone ringing]

534
00:20:47,763 --> 00:20:49,627
Hi.

535
00:20:49,731 --> 00:20:51,595
- Do you have something
to tell me?

536
00:20:51,698 --> 00:20:54,460
- Yes. I went
to the doctor's today.

537
00:20:54,563 --> 00:20:55,875
- And?

538
00:20:55,978 --> 00:20:57,670
- I'm getting induced
on Monday.

539
00:20:57,773 --> 00:20:59,982
- Really?
- Yes.

540
00:21:00,086 --> 00:21:01,846
- Oh, my goodness.
How do you feel?

541
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,676
- [laughs]
- Are you nervous?

542
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:05,022
- Yeah, I'm nervous.

543
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,473
- Maybe--maybe we can get up
there in time and we won't

544
00:21:07,576 --> 00:21:08,405
miss it.

545
00:21:08,508 --> 00:21:09,578
- Yeah.

546
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:12,788
[door slams sharply]
Are you locking me out?

547
00:21:14,859 --> 00:21:17,448
- [sobs]
- You okay?

548
00:21:17,552 --> 00:21:20,658
- No.

549
00:21:20,762 --> 00:21:21,487
- Don't sit in here.

550
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,627
You're making me feel bad.

551
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:30,875
- [sniffles]
- It'll be all right, Ma.

552
00:21:36,364 --> 00:21:38,607
Since we're going to
the hospital Monday morning,

553
00:21:38,711 --> 00:21:41,300
Tyler decided to write a letter
to our daughter so she will

554
00:21:41,403 --> 00:21:44,648
always know where she comes from
and that she is loved.

555
00:21:44,751 --> 00:21:46,753
I want to hear what it--
yours says.

556
00:21:46,857 --> 00:21:48,272
- Okay.

557
00:21:48,376 --> 00:21:50,930
"first off, I want to tell you
I love you so much.

558
00:21:51,033 --> 00:21:54,589
Words can never explain the love
a father has for his daughter.

559
00:21:54,692 --> 00:21:57,108
When your mom and I found out
she was pregnant with you,

560
00:21:57,212 --> 00:21:58,765
we didn't know what we
were going to do.

561
00:21:58,869 --> 00:22:01,458
We were so young and
inexperienced in life yet.

562
00:22:01,561 --> 00:22:03,667
After thinking and thinking,
we came to the decision that

563
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:06,014
adoption was the best choice
for you.

564
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:08,913
The thought of what kind of dad
I wanted to be and what you

565
00:22:09,017 --> 00:22:11,571
deserve in life just didn't mix.

566
00:22:11,675 --> 00:22:13,297
I think about you every day.

567
00:22:13,401 --> 00:22:15,472
You are everything to me.

568
00:22:15,575 --> 00:22:18,095
I don't ever, ever want you
to think I didn't want you.

569
00:22:18,198 --> 00:22:19,061
I will always love you.

570
00:22:19,165 --> 00:22:20,442
You are in my thoughts
every day.

571
00:22:20,546 --> 00:22:22,202
Love, your daddy."

572
00:22:22,306 --> 00:22:23,203
- That's sad.

573
00:22:23,307 --> 00:22:25,344
You're gonna make me cry.

574
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:31,142
Come here.

575
00:22:31,246 --> 00:22:33,352
Give me a hug.

576
00:22:46,848 --> 00:22:49,747
- I don't know.

577
00:22:49,851 --> 00:22:51,853
But it's so hard
to give her away.

578
00:22:53,855 --> 00:22:55,684
- I know. It's gonna be
really hard.

579
00:22:55,788 --> 00:22:57,410
- And now it's getting
so close.

580
00:22:57,514 --> 00:23:00,068
It's, like, the reality
is really starting to hit.

581
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:02,104
[inhales]

582
00:23:04,866 --> 00:23:08,076
- Like, you always tell me
we can do this, right?

583
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:09,664
- Yeah.
- We have to do this.

584
00:23:09,767 --> 00:23:12,667
- This is what we prepared for.

585
00:23:16,533 --> 00:23:18,362
- But it doesn't matter
how ready we are,

586
00:23:18,466 --> 00:23:19,432
because ready or not...

587
00:23:19,536 --> 00:23:21,434
[chime dings]
this baby's coming.

588
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,926
- I can't believe I'm on my way
to the hospital to be induced

589
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:33,757
and that I'm going to give birth
sometime today.

590
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,380
I've been through so much
already, and I still feel

591
00:23:36,484 --> 00:23:38,796
totally unprepared.

592
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:45,838
[woman speaking indistinctly]

593
00:23:48,979 --> 00:23:50,498
- Do you have a problem
with IVs?

594
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:51,982
- No, I just don't like
needles.

595
00:23:52,085 --> 00:23:53,846
- Okay, then don't watch.
- Once it's in, I'm done.

596
00:23:53,949 --> 00:23:57,746
- Okay. I'm gonna
draw your blood.

597
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,127
So you're gonna feel it
move around.

598
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,301
It's gonna feel weird.
- Okay.

599
00:24:01,405 --> 00:24:04,650
- Every half hour, we're gonna
put the pitocin dose up.

600
00:24:04,753 --> 00:24:05,789
- Does that make my
contractions or something?

601
00:24:05,892 --> 00:24:07,273
- It will make your
contractions.

602
00:24:07,376 --> 00:24:09,240
- 'Cause I've already felt that
they were already getting

603
00:24:09,344 --> 00:24:11,208
a little bit worse,
unless that's in my mind.

604
00:24:11,311 --> 00:24:12,761
It feels like I had
a little one.

605
00:24:12,865 --> 00:24:13,693
- A little contraction?

606
00:24:13,797 --> 00:24:15,764
- Mm-hmm.

607
00:24:15,868 --> 00:24:17,525
- [heartbeat thumping]

608
00:24:17,628 --> 00:24:19,285
- How far apart are they?

609
00:24:19,388 --> 00:24:20,355
They're not that far apart.

610
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,667
- Uh-uh.

611
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:23,082
- Yay.

612
00:24:23,185 --> 00:24:24,635
Then they're gonna come in
here and...

613
00:24:24,739 --> 00:24:25,602
- Boost it up more.

614
00:24:25,705 --> 00:24:26,775
- Mm-hmm.

615
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:28,052
- Knock, knock.

616
00:24:28,156 --> 00:24:28,881
- Hi.

617
00:24:28,984 --> 00:24:30,503
- Hey, how you doing?

618
00:24:30,607 --> 00:24:31,573
- All right, I guess.

619
00:24:31,677 --> 00:24:33,023
- Yeah?

620
00:24:33,126 --> 00:24:34,852
What I'd like to do is
go ahead and check your cervix,

621
00:24:34,956 --> 00:24:36,509
and I want to break your water
for you.

622
00:24:36,613 --> 00:24:37,890
- All right.

623
00:24:37,993 --> 00:24:39,236
- Once we break your water,
there's no turning back.

624
00:24:39,339 --> 00:24:41,065
Okay, now I'm going to break
your water, so you'll feel

625
00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:43,689
pressure here, and just again,
feel your muscles.

626
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:45,518
Let them fall into the bed.

627
00:24:45,622 --> 00:24:47,244
Perfect. Pressure now.

628
00:24:47,347 --> 00:24:49,108
And that's your water.

629
00:24:49,211 --> 00:24:50,178
Here you go.

630
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:51,317
And the fluid--
- God, it feels like

631
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,215
I'm peeing myself.
- I need a towel, please.

632
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:54,631
- Okay.

633
00:24:54,734 --> 00:24:57,806
- There you go.

634
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:58,773
You're doing good.

635
00:24:58,876 --> 00:25:00,637
Hang in there.

636
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,810
We waited nine months for this.

637
00:25:01,914 --> 00:25:03,709
- Yeah.

638
00:25:03,812 --> 00:25:06,919
[exhales]

639
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,716
- Okay, honey.

640
00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:13,822
- [breathing deeply]

641
00:25:17,377 --> 00:25:22,313
[sniffles]
[heartbeat pulses on monitor]

642
00:25:22,417 --> 00:25:24,005
- Oh, honey.

643
00:25:24,108 --> 00:25:25,938
- [sighs]
- I love you.

644
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:29,528
- I love you too.

645
00:25:29,631 --> 00:25:33,083
- It's gonna get better.

646
00:25:33,186 --> 00:25:36,189
- Once you get your epidural,
there's gonna be a pump

647
00:25:36,293 --> 00:25:37,846
hooked up--
- [sighs] Sorry.

648
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,918
- That's okay. You can
breathe through it.

649
00:25:41,022 --> 00:25:44,577
Just keep breathing.
You're doing great.

650
00:25:44,681 --> 00:25:47,200
You're doing great.

651
00:25:47,304 --> 00:25:51,135
- [exhales]
- There you go.

652
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:52,723
It's at its worst right now.

653
00:25:52,827 --> 00:25:56,313
It's gonna be coming down.

654
00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:58,004
- Is she getting the epidural
now?

655
00:25:58,108 --> 00:25:59,488
- Yeah.
- Yep. Yep.

656
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:02,526
They're right outside the door.
- Okay.

657
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,355
- I will--

658
00:26:04,459 --> 00:26:06,047
Breathe, Cate.
- Mom, it frickin' hurts.

659
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,980
- You got to breathe, Cate.

660
00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:13,951
- I got my epidural
while Tyler went to meet

661
00:26:14,055 --> 00:26:16,022
Brandon and Teresa,
who were going to wait

662
00:26:16,126 --> 00:26:17,817
in the reception area.

663
00:26:17,921 --> 00:26:19,094
- Hi, guys.
- How you feeeling?

664
00:26:19,198 --> 00:26:20,924
You doing all right?
- Yeah.

665
00:26:21,027 --> 00:26:23,167
- Hanging in there?
- Hanging in there.

666
00:26:23,271 --> 00:26:25,135
Yeah, trying to, at least.

667
00:26:25,238 --> 00:26:26,239
Trying to hang in there.

668
00:26:26,343 --> 00:26:27,862
- Ty, you're a little pale.
- Yeah.

669
00:26:27,965 --> 00:26:30,174
- Got a little pale.
- Yeah.

670
00:26:30,278 --> 00:26:31,831
They checked her just now,
and she's between five and six.

671
00:26:31,935 --> 00:26:33,419
- And she's right between
five and six?

672
00:26:33,522 --> 00:26:35,559
- And she's 100% effaced.
- That's good.

673
00:26:35,663 --> 00:26:38,148
She's definitely progressing,
then.

674
00:26:38,251 --> 00:26:40,702
Like, who else is upstairs?

675
00:26:40,806 --> 00:26:42,980
- My mom, her mom, and Sarah.

676
00:26:43,084 --> 00:26:46,018
- Do they know we're coming?
- Yeah, yes.

677
00:26:46,121 --> 00:26:48,434
[laughter]
- I hope I'm not getting

678
00:26:48,537 --> 00:26:50,919
everyone freaked out,
but they told me.

679
00:26:51,023 --> 00:26:52,196
It's--she's at 9 1/2.

680
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,819
It's, like, okay.

681
00:26:57,788 --> 00:26:59,514
- Yeah.
- Oh, my.

682
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,828
- I'm shocked.

683
00:27:02,931 --> 00:27:03,898
- You're at 9 1/2?

684
00:27:04,001 --> 00:27:05,071
- Mm-hmm.

685
