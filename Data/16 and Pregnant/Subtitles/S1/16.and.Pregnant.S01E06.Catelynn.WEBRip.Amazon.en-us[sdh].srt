00:00:03,624 --> 00:00:05,005
- Hi, my name is Catelynn.

3
00:00:05,108 --> 00:00:07,835
[chime dings]

4
00:00:07,938 --> 00:00:09,043
I'm 16, and I'm from

5
00:00:09,147 --> 00:00:11,149
Algonac, Michigan,
a small town right across

6
00:00:11,252 --> 00:00:13,013
the river from Canada.

7
00:00:13,116 --> 00:00:14,980
During the winter,
there's absolutely nothing

8
00:00:15,084 --> 00:00:17,983
to do around here,
unless you like ice fishing.

9
00:00:19,191 --> 00:00:20,399
That's my boyfriend, Tyler.

10
00:00:20,503 --> 00:00:22,263
We've been together since
seventh grade.

11
00:00:22,367 --> 00:00:25,197
You're a little flirt,
especially in music class.

12
00:00:25,301 --> 00:00:27,061
- We used to write notes
back to each other.

13
00:00:27,165 --> 00:00:29,788
- My family situation
is totally chaotic.

14
00:00:29,891 --> 00:00:31,134
- Let's get 'er done.

15
00:00:31,238 --> 00:00:33,654
- I've lived in 13 different
houses since I was born.

16
00:00:33,757 --> 00:00:35,035
Hate moving.

17
00:00:35,138 --> 00:00:37,071
- My mom is pretty
unpredictable, and she can be

18
00:00:37,175 --> 00:00:38,003
really moody.

19
00:00:38,107 --> 00:00:39,556
- Bitch.

20
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:41,627
- She does her best,
but I never know if she'll

21
00:00:41,731 --> 00:00:43,112
really be there for me.

22
00:00:43,215 --> 00:00:45,873
My mom ended up driving drunk
last night and got pulled over

23
00:00:45,976 --> 00:00:47,288
and went to jail.

24
00:00:47,392 --> 00:00:49,083
Tyler's life has been hard too.

25
00:00:49,187 --> 00:00:50,878
His dad, Butch, has been
in and out of prison for

26
00:00:50,981 --> 00:00:52,052
most of his life.

27
00:00:52,155 --> 00:00:54,157
[chime dings]
Even though Tyler and I are

28
00:00:54,261 --> 00:00:57,367
used to surprises, nothing could
have shocked us more than

29
00:00:57,471 --> 00:01:00,198
when our parents fell in love
and then got married.

30
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:02,269
So technically,
we're stepsiblings.

31
00:01:02,372 --> 00:01:04,892
But we say that they're
the weird ones, because we

32
00:01:04,995 --> 00:01:07,101
were dating first.

33
00:01:07,205 --> 00:01:09,897
Even though it seems like
a recipe for drama,

34
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,900
for the most part,
everyone gets along.

35
00:01:13,003 --> 00:01:16,145
But it's about to get a whole
lot crazier around here,

36
00:01:16,248 --> 00:01:19,389
because I'm pregnant.

37
00:01:26,776 --> 00:01:29,468
We're still juniors in high
school, and we're not sure

38
00:01:29,572 --> 00:01:32,713
we're ready to be parents,
so we're talking about adoption.

39
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:35,267
- She cried.

40
00:01:35,371 --> 00:01:37,545
- No, I cried for--
- I would cry too, Tyler.

41
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:40,100
- I did cry. I was so scared.

42
00:01:40,203 --> 00:01:42,240
- It's, like, I got something
growing in me.

43
00:01:42,343 --> 00:01:44,966
- You got something growing
in you.

44
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,142
- And that something turned out
to be a baby girl.

45
00:01:48,246 --> 00:01:49,764
I don't really know
what I'm gonna do.

46
00:01:49,868 --> 00:01:51,697
Me and Ty talked about, like,
keeping it, but there's not

47
00:01:51,801 --> 00:01:53,458
really a lot of good things
about keeping it.

48
00:01:53,561 --> 00:01:54,597
Like, there is, but there isn't.

49
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,977
You know.

50
00:01:56,081 --> 00:01:57,462
There's scary things about
adoption, but I mean, like,

51
00:01:57,565 --> 00:02:00,672
parenting, that, I mean,
that's even scarier.

52
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,401
- Dude, how'd you learn
don't get pregnant earlier?

53
00:02:05,504 --> 00:02:07,092
You didn't use condoms?

54
00:02:07,196 --> 00:02:08,645
- Yeah, I did.

55
00:02:08,749 --> 00:02:09,957
I used them, and then they got
washed in the washing machine.

56
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:10,889
- And now you're pregnant.

57
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,341
- So are you gonna keep it?

58
00:02:14,444 --> 00:02:16,515
- I don't know what I'm gonna
do yet.

59
00:02:16,619 --> 00:02:18,483
If I give her up for adoption,
like, I always say, like,

60
00:02:18,586 --> 00:02:21,555
imagine, like,
walking in there and, like,

61
00:02:21,658 --> 00:02:23,902
feeling it move and, like,
it's in you, and then

62
00:02:24,005 --> 00:02:25,628
walking out with nothing.

63
00:02:25,731 --> 00:02:28,631
And you're just, like,
leaving with nothing.

64
00:02:28,734 --> 00:02:31,254
- Like you did the total
nine months--

65
00:02:31,358 --> 00:02:32,980
- Yeah.
- --for nothing.

66
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:34,499
- Yeah.

67
00:02:34,602 --> 00:02:36,225
- I don't think you're really
in, like, a position to raise

68
00:02:36,328 --> 00:02:37,640
a kid.

69
00:02:37,743 --> 00:02:39,366
- Like, how am I supposed
to raise a kid when I'm a kid

70
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:40,919
myself?
- Yeah.

71
00:02:41,022 --> 00:02:42,679
I would cry, if I were you.

72
00:02:42,783 --> 00:02:44,440
- I already did enough of that.

00:02:44,543 --> 00:02:47,028
[percussive music]
â™ª 

74
00:02:47,132 --> 00:02:50,031
Although our friends think
adoption makes sense,

75
00:02:50,135 --> 00:02:52,758
my mom is pretty disappointed
that we're considering it.

76
00:02:52,862 --> 00:02:55,036
I thought it would be different
after I told you.

77
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,004
[chuckles]
Just 'cause that's--

78
00:02:57,107 --> 00:02:59,006
- What? That I would hate you?

79
00:02:59,109 --> 00:03:00,283
- No, just that you would,
like, that things would be

80
00:03:00,387 --> 00:03:01,250
different, like...

81
00:03:01,353 --> 00:03:02,803
- No, I still love you.

82
00:03:02,906 --> 00:03:05,668
- I know you don't agree
with adoption, though, really.

83
00:03:05,771 --> 00:03:07,083
- No, I don't agree with it.

84
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,878
You know, that's why I got to
state my opinion very much,

85
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:10,431
so...

86
00:03:10,535 --> 00:03:12,019
You can change your mind
anyways.

87
00:03:12,122 --> 00:03:14,642
Doesn't matter.

88
00:03:14,746 --> 00:03:17,645
- And Tyler's dad was anything
but supportive.

89
00:03:17,749 --> 00:03:19,268
- I couldn't imagine
giving you away.

90
00:03:19,371 --> 00:03:20,338
I couldn't do it.

91
00:03:20,441 --> 00:03:21,546
I wouldn't let your mother
do it.

92
00:03:21,649 --> 00:03:22,926
I mean, I'll find some way.

93
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:26,896
- I want my daughter to have,
like, a chance at life.

94
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:28,863
And I know she'll have a chance
at life with me, okay?

95
00:03:28,967 --> 00:03:32,833
But I just don't want her
to be raised the way

96
00:03:32,936 --> 00:03:34,973
that she's gonna be raised--
- I'm gonna put it out here

97
00:03:35,076 --> 00:03:36,319
like this.

98
00:03:36,423 --> 00:03:37,907
Here's my son.

99
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,184
He's 16, 17 years old.

100
00:03:39,288 --> 00:03:40,461
He has his baby.

101
00:03:40,565 --> 00:03:43,464
He gives it away,
gives the kid away to some

102
00:03:43,568 --> 00:03:47,399
great family, which are
great people.

103
00:03:47,503 --> 00:03:51,438
And, uh, he didn't man up.

104
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:52,646
You didn't man up.

105
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:55,476
You wasn't the cowboy
I thought you were.

106
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,513
I don't know.
What am I gonna think?

107
00:03:57,616 --> 00:04:00,170
I don't know what else to think.

108
00:04:00,274 --> 00:04:03,726
- It really changes things not
to have our family's support.

109
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:06,073
But as hard as it might be
for my mom and Butch,

110
00:04:06,176 --> 00:04:10,319
ultimately, we're the ones
who have to make this decision.

111
00:04:10,422 --> 00:04:13,356
What do you think that
we should do?

112
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:14,495
- Keeping it.

113
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:16,152
Adopting it.

114
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:19,949
Those are our last two options.

115
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:23,228
- Well, keeping it would
probably be kind of stressful.

116
00:04:23,332 --> 00:04:26,611
- I think keeping the baby
would totally ruin us.

117
00:04:26,714 --> 00:04:29,993
- You think so?
- I know so.

118
00:04:30,097 --> 00:04:33,687
I don't think our lives are
very stable to raise a child.

119
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,413
- No, like, my household.

120
00:04:35,516 --> 00:04:37,104
- My household and your
household.

121
00:04:37,207 --> 00:04:39,140
- Mm-hmm.

122
00:04:39,244 --> 00:04:41,177
- You don't even got a job.

123
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,835
We're not graduated.

124
00:04:43,938 --> 00:04:46,216
- Like, who would watch it if,
like, I went to school?

125
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,080
- Yeah.

126
00:04:48,184 --> 00:04:51,118
- Whatever--whatever we decide
to do, I just hope everybody's

127
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:52,637
there to back us up.

128
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:54,432
- I don't care if anybody's
there to back us up.

129
00:04:54,535 --> 00:04:55,950
- Yeah.

130
00:04:56,054 --> 00:04:59,471
- 'cause no one else's opinion
matters, especially my dad.

131
00:04:59,575 --> 00:05:01,508
- We don't really know that
much about adoption, though,

132
00:05:01,611 --> 00:05:04,925
really, just that...

133
00:05:05,028 --> 00:05:08,756
I think it would be good,
though.

134
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:13,071
- I think adoption would be
the best option.

135
00:05:13,174 --> 00:05:16,868
[mellow guitar solo]
[chime dings]

136
00:05:16,971 --> 00:05:20,596
- Okay, so we've decided we're
not ready to raise a child,

137
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:23,668
but are we strong enough
to give one away?

138
00:05:31,641 --> 00:05:34,920
- Our parents may not support
us, but we've decided to go

139
00:05:35,024 --> 00:05:38,303
to the adoption agency anyway
to get things started.

140
00:05:38,407 --> 00:05:40,201
- Can you tell me in your
own words why you think

141
00:05:40,305 --> 00:05:43,377
an adoption plan might be
the right choice for you?

142
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:46,380
- I think it's the right choice
just because I don't really

143
00:05:46,484 --> 00:05:48,382
have a stable household.

144
00:05:48,486 --> 00:05:49,590
We're too young.

145
00:05:49,694 --> 00:05:51,247
We want to go to coll--
we want to go to school,

146
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:54,250
you know, go to college,
finish college, get on our feet,

147
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:57,046
and then maybe have kids
later on.

148
00:05:57,149 --> 00:05:59,566
- You're in the driver's seat
of your adoption plan.

149
00:05:59,669 --> 00:06:03,259
This is gonna look and feel the
way that you guys want it to.

150
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,399
- I want to be able to, like,
maybe call her if I want to

151
00:06:05,503 --> 00:06:08,368
or send her pictures
or send her Christmas presents

152
00:06:08,471 --> 00:06:13,545
and birthday presents and get
pictures of her and stuff.

153
00:06:13,649 --> 00:06:16,445
- So what--what we would do
when we're looking at adoptive

154
00:06:16,548 --> 00:06:19,068
families is, we look at what's
called a profile book,

155
00:06:19,171 --> 00:06:21,622
and it's a book that they
put together that has pictures

156
00:06:21,726 --> 00:06:25,039
about them, that shows their
interests in life,

157
00:06:25,143 --> 00:06:27,145
and you have the ability
to look through these.

158
00:06:27,248 --> 00:06:29,596
So I can send some of these
home with you today.

159
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:31,529
- All right.
- Okay.

160
00:06:31,632 --> 00:06:34,014
- You have to come to the place
where you make a decision

161
00:06:34,117 --> 00:06:35,878
about what's right for you.

162
00:06:35,981 --> 00:06:39,882
Sometimes the most loving thing
we can do is to be selfless

163
00:06:39,985 --> 00:06:41,297
and let go.
- Yes.

164
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,332
- Mm-hmm.

165
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:44,611
- And so that doesn't mean
it's easy.

166
00:06:44,714 --> 00:06:46,164
- No.

167
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:48,787
- It doesn't mean that it's not
without grief and without loss,

168
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:51,376
because I'll tell you,
it will be the hardest thing

169
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:56,346
that you've ever had to do
in your life.

170
00:06:56,450 --> 00:07:00,109
[school bell rings]
- I was keeping up in school

171
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:02,870
and actually feeling pretty good
about our decision.

172
00:07:02,974 --> 00:07:05,459
- Are you guys still thinking
about the adoption thing?

173
00:07:05,563 --> 00:07:06,805
- Yeah.

174
00:07:06,909 --> 00:07:09,739
Been a lot harder for me
than I thought it was gonna be.

175
00:07:09,843 --> 00:07:11,051
- Yeah.

176
00:07:11,154 --> 00:07:15,055
- You know, like,
actually deciding to do it

177
00:07:15,158 --> 00:07:17,747
has been harder.

178
00:07:17,851 --> 00:07:20,681
- You think you're gonna end up
going through with it?

179
00:07:20,785 --> 00:07:21,889
- Oh, yeah.

180
00:07:21,993 --> 00:07:23,235
Especially--for sure.

181
00:07:23,339 --> 00:07:25,375
- Once you actually hold it--
- I'm not holding her.

182
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:26,825
I don't want to hold her.

183
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:28,758
- I'm holding that baby when
it comes out of your [bleep].

184
00:07:28,862 --> 00:07:30,242
- I want to too.

185
00:07:30,346 --> 00:07:32,313
[laughter]
- I know it's the best thing,

186
00:07:32,417 --> 00:07:33,694
so I don't want to be selfish.

187
00:07:33,798 --> 00:07:35,282
I don't want to hold her
and be, like, "Oh, I want you."

188
00:07:35,385 --> 00:07:36,801
- This is the best thing,
though.

189
00:07:36,904 --> 00:07:38,699
- But you should hold her--
- Could you imagine if we

190
00:07:38,803 --> 00:07:40,805
kept her, how screwed up
that baby would be?

191
00:07:40,908 --> 00:07:42,600
And, like, I talked--
I talked to everybody,

192
00:07:42,703 --> 00:07:44,429
and they're, like, "Dude,
if I got pregnant right now,

193
00:07:44,533 --> 00:07:45,465
I would just get an abortion."

194
00:07:45,568 --> 00:07:47,743
- I would.
I'm telling you right now.

195
00:07:47,846 --> 00:07:49,123
And I wouldn't have the strength
to give it away like you guys.

196
00:07:49,227 --> 00:07:52,851
- Yeah.

197
00:07:52,955 --> 00:07:55,336
- How many family profile books
did Dawn give you?

198
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:58,063
- There's ten of them.

199
00:07:58,167 --> 00:07:59,824
Just gonna pick one.

200
00:07:59,927 --> 00:08:01,619
- "Left is our
current family."

201
00:08:01,722 --> 00:08:02,965
- Mm-hmm.

202
00:08:03,068 --> 00:08:04,725
Yeah, but see, we don't want
anybody with kids, though,

203
00:08:04,829 --> 00:08:08,073
unless they're adopted.

204
00:08:08,177 --> 00:08:09,903
- They're older, I think.

205
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:13,803
So this is the family that

206
00:08:13,907 --> 00:08:14,770
I really like.

207
00:08:14,873 --> 00:08:16,530
- [together] Brandon
and Teresa.

208
00:08:16,634 --> 00:08:19,188
- She's skiing,
or whatever it's called.

209
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,466
- Water-skiiing?
- Water-skiing.

210
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,813
- I think it's good for our
daughter to have a stay-at-home

211
00:08:23,917 --> 00:08:26,471
mom too, so that way, like,
she's not always in day care.

212
00:08:26,575 --> 00:08:29,094
- I want--I want the dad to be
definitely college-educated.

213
00:08:29,198 --> 00:08:30,579
Bachelor's, master's, whatever.

214
00:08:30,682 --> 00:08:32,477
As long as he graduated
from college.

215
00:08:32,581 --> 00:08:35,169
- Yeah.

216
00:08:35,273 --> 00:08:36,239
- Oh, yeah, husband.

217
00:08:36,343 --> 00:08:37,793
He's a financial planner.

218
00:08:37,896 --> 00:08:38,690
- So what's that?

219
00:08:38,794 --> 00:08:40,071
I don't even know what that is.

220
00:08:40,174 --> 00:08:41,555
- And this would be a good--
really good family, I think.

221
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:42,936
- I know, I really like them.

222
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,178
- I like these people.

223
00:08:44,282 --> 00:08:45,386
- Look at that house.

224
00:08:45,490 --> 00:08:47,734
- It's a nice house.

225
00:08:47,837 --> 00:08:49,908
- So what do you think we're
gonna tell dawn next time

226
00:08:50,012 --> 00:08:51,116
we go in there?

227
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:52,808
- We looked at some of them,
and we read them.

228
00:08:52,911 --> 00:08:55,258
And--but nobody really
sticks out like they do.

229
00:08:55,362 --> 00:08:58,020
- I think the same way, so...

230
00:09:01,506 --> 00:09:04,095
With our family selected,
we made another appointment

231
00:09:04,198 --> 00:09:07,650
to see Dawn, something Butch
wasn't too happy about.

232
00:09:07,754 --> 00:09:09,756
- Where do you think
it's gonna be better off?

233
00:09:09,859 --> 00:09:11,861
Not with your own natural
parents?

234
00:09:11,965 --> 00:09:13,035
- Because we can't.

235
00:09:13,138 --> 00:09:14,657
- I don't understand.
I mean, material-wise?

236
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:16,245
- Both: No.

237
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:17,211
- Emotionally-wise.

238
00:09:17,315 --> 00:09:18,419
- Emotional, stable.

239
00:09:18,523 --> 00:09:21,146
- Stable household.
A stable household.

240
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,562
- So it's not moving
all the time.

241
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:24,460
- Stable house--you make that.
That's your choice.

242
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,151
- Ha.
- Ha?

243
00:09:26,255 --> 00:09:27,256
- How about so we keep
the baby?

244
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,360
Okay, so we keep the baby.

245
00:09:28,464 --> 00:09:29,914
Six months from now,
we get it here.

246
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:32,537
Okay, the crib's in Catelynn's
small little room.

247
00:09:32,641 --> 00:09:33,538
- Oh, it ain't good enough?

248
00:09:33,642 --> 00:09:35,022
- No, you're absolutely right.

249
00:09:35,126 --> 00:09:35,954
It's not good enough.

250
00:09:36,058 --> 00:09:37,197
Not good enough for my kid.

251
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,336

Not good enough for my kid.

252
00:09:38,439 --> 00:09:41,132
My kid deserves way better
than this.

253
00:09:41,235 --> 00:09:42,547
Way better.
- Okay.

254
00:09:42,651 --> 00:09:43,513
- You're absolutely right.

255
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:44,514
Not good enough for my kid.

256
00:09:44,618 --> 00:09:46,724
- Okay, I see what you're
saying.

257
00:09:46,827 --> 00:09:48,449
All that baby needs is love.

258
00:09:48,553 --> 00:09:51,004
- No, that's not all a baby
needs is love, Dad.

259
00:09:51,107 --> 00:09:52,695
You have no idea what
you're talking about.

260
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:54,179
- I gave you the role model.

261
00:09:54,283 --> 00:09:55,422
- You gave me a role model?

262
00:09:55,525 --> 00:09:56,975
You weren't even in my life
for my whole life.

263
00:09:57,079 --> 00:09:58,839
What are you talking about,
"Gave me a role model?"

264
00:09:58,943 --> 00:10:00,600
you made a stupid choice,
and you were in prison.

265
00:10:00,703 --> 00:10:01,946
- Give the kid some love, man.

266
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:04,500
- And it's gonna have plenty
of love in the house that

267
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,502
it's going to. Plenty of it.

268
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,055
- Screw that house,
that wherever it's going.

269
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:10,886
- Yeah. Screw this house.

270
00:10:14,544 --> 00:10:22,967
[peaceful guitar music]
â™ª 

271
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,313
- I love you.

272
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:25,659
- I love you too.

273
00:10:25,763 --> 00:10:28,075
- Despite our parents'
disapproval, Dawn came over

274
00:10:28,179 --> 00:10:30,526
to Tyler's house because we're
ready to move forward with

275
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,976
the adoption plan.

276
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,944
- So you took home a whole
bunch of profile books, right?

277
00:10:35,048 --> 00:10:36,152
- Yeah.

278
00:10:36,256 --> 00:10:37,360
- And did you get a chance
to look them over?

279
00:10:37,464 --> 00:10:38,638
- Yep, we did.

280
00:10:38,741 --> 00:10:41,641
- Okay, did anything stand out
to you in them?

281
00:10:41,744 --> 00:10:43,159
- [together] Brandon
and Teresa.

282
00:10:43,263 --> 00:10:44,574
- Brandon and Teresa.

283
00:10:44,678 --> 00:10:48,578
Okay, what about them stands out
as "the right family

284
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:49,994
for our baby?"

285
00:10:50,097 --> 00:10:51,961
- Well, pretty much, I just
like everything about them.

286
00:10:52,065 --> 00:10:53,825
Everything that I wanted,
they have, pretty much.

287
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:55,413
She's gonna be
a stay-at-home mom.

288
00:10:55,516 --> 00:10:57,035
- Yeah.
- All right.

289
00:10:57,139 --> 00:10:59,175
- And the dad's gonna be
the provider.

290
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,419
Like, in my heart it was, like,
a feeling that you just get.

291
00:11:01,522 --> 00:11:02,938
Like, it's, like,
these are the people.

292
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:07,011
- So when's the soonest
that we can meet these people?

293
00:11:07,114 --> 00:11:08,875
- Well, I--you know,
they have to book a flight,

294
00:11:08,978 --> 00:11:12,706
so probably within a week or
two, we can do that.

295
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,294
If you guys are up for it.

296
00:11:14,397 --> 00:11:15,813
- Okay.
- Oh, I'm up for it.

297
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,436
- When we get to the adoptive
family meeting, we talk about

298
00:11:18,539 --> 00:11:21,266
exactly what you'd like to see
happen at the hospital.

299
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:22,578
- Okay.

300
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:23,924
- And, Catelynn, a lot of that
is up to you.

301
00:11:24,028 --> 00:11:27,307
When the baby is born,
do I want immediate contact with

302
00:11:27,410 --> 00:11:28,722
the baby in the delivery room?

303
00:11:28,826 --> 00:11:30,379
And you're shaking your head,
"No, I don't."

304
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:33,934
so you've thought about it
a little bit. That's good.

305
00:11:34,038 --> 00:11:35,384
- Yeah, I already know,
actually, what I want to do.

306
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:37,041
If I were to, like, even see
her, I'd get already attached,

307
00:11:37,144 --> 00:11:38,801
be like, "No, I'm taking her
home with me."

308
00:11:38,905 --> 00:11:41,148
I'd think I'd get really selfish
at that moment.

309
00:11:41,252 --> 00:11:42,943
- I will tell you.

310
00:11:43,047 --> 00:11:47,361
I have never had somebody regret
doing a hello and a good-bye.

311
00:11:47,465 --> 00:11:48,777
- Yeah.

312
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,952
- And that is--that's a moment
that you can't recapture

313
00:11:52,056 --> 00:11:53,920
later on.

314
00:11:54,023 --> 00:11:57,233
And so it's something you want
to think about.

315
00:11:57,337 --> 00:11:58,303
- Makes me want to cry.

316
00:11:58,407 --> 00:12:00,098
- It does?
- Yeah.

317
00:12:00,202 --> 00:12:02,100
- What part of it makes you
want to cry?

318
00:12:02,204 --> 00:12:03,239
- I don't know.

319
00:12:03,343 --> 00:12:05,276
- Aw.

320
00:12:12,214 --> 00:12:15,182
- This is going to be harder
than I thought.

321
00:12:22,707 --> 00:12:25,468
- Because it's harder to move
around these days, I'm trying

322
00:12:25,572 --> 00:12:28,057
to keep up with school from
home, but I never thought

323
00:12:28,161 --> 00:12:30,542
schoolwork would be the least
of my worries.

324
00:12:30,646 --> 00:12:33,476
My mom knows I'm going forward
with the adoption,

325
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,720
but she's been dropping
not-so-subtle hints that she

326
00:12:35,824 --> 00:12:38,688
wants me to change my mind:
bringing baby clothes home

327
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:41,105
and even buying a bassinet.

328
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:46,766
- 'Cause I think you'd be
a good mom.

329
00:12:46,869 --> 00:12:49,078
- Mm-hmm.

330
00:12:49,182 --> 00:12:50,839
- Me and Butch would help you.

331
00:12:50,942 --> 00:12:53,186
- Yeah.

332
00:12:53,289 --> 00:12:54,912
- It's my first grandbaby.

333
00:12:55,015 --> 00:12:56,258
I already love her.

334
00:12:56,361 --> 00:12:58,536
- Mm-hmm, well, yeah,
you love her.

335
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,503
- Well, I'm always gonna
be thinking about her.

336
00:13:00,607 --> 00:13:02,160
And I think it will bug you.

337
00:13:02,264 --> 00:13:03,265
- You think it will bug me?

338
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:05,232
- Mm-hmm.

339
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:13,827
- Scared 'cause if I keep her,
you know, and then I'm scared

340
00:13:13,931 --> 00:13:15,139
if I give her away.

341
00:13:15,242 --> 00:13:18,590
I'm scared of, like,
the pain I'll go through.

342
00:13:18,694 --> 00:13:20,109
- Wait till she's born.

343
00:13:20,213 --> 00:13:22,629
How do you think you're gonna
feel then?

344
00:13:22,732 --> 00:13:24,044
- Yeah.

345
00:13:24,148 --> 00:13:27,530
I don't know what to expect,
honestly.

346
00:13:27,634 --> 00:13:28,635
- It's your decision.

347
00:13:28,738 --> 00:13:32,604
You're the one that has to live
with it.

348
00:13:32,708 --> 00:13:35,469
And you still got time
to change your mind.

349
00:13:35,573 --> 00:13:39,370
- Yeah, I know.

350
00:13:39,473 --> 00:13:42,373
Only nine weeks away from
my due date, my mom is taking me

351
00:13:42,476 --> 00:13:45,548
to get a sonogram to check
the baby's growth and position.

352
00:13:45,652 --> 00:13:48,310
I think she hopes it's going
to make me change my mind.

353
00:13:48,413 --> 00:13:50,105
- Catelynn, do you know
what you're having already?

354
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:52,314
- Yep, it's a girl.
- Okay.

355
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:54,695
I'm gonna bring this up,
and we're gonna put warm gel

356
00:13:54,799 --> 00:13:56,076
on your belly.

357
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:59,666
This is the placenta across

358
00:13:59,769 --> 00:14:00,978
the top of the uterus here.

359
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:02,358
- Mm-hmm.

360
00:14:02,462 --> 00:14:03,808
- Okay, now we're gonna try
and get a little bit

361
00:14:03,912 --> 00:14:04,878
of the face.

362
00:14:04,982 --> 00:14:05,983
It's tucked down here
pretty low.

363
00:14:06,086 --> 00:14:07,053
- Oh, I see.

364
00:14:07,156 --> 00:14:08,192
- You can see the eye
right here.

365
00:14:08,295 --> 00:14:09,607
- She looks like you, Tyler.

366
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,574
- A little bit of the other
eye and the side of a hand

367
00:14:11,678 --> 00:14:14,992
blocking her.

368
00:14:15,095 --> 00:14:18,167
- Look at whose nose she's got.

369
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:19,479
- She's definitely got my chin.

370
00:14:19,582 --> 00:14:21,412
- Mm-mm.

371
00:14:21,515 --> 00:14:23,448
- For sure.

372
00:14:25,036 --> 00:14:31,422
[soothing instrumental music]
â™ª 

373
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:33,493
- I was worried that seeing
the baby would make my mom

374
00:14:33,596 --> 00:14:37,462
too attached, but it may be me
who's getting attached.

375
00:14:42,226 --> 00:14:44,400
Before I knew it,
we were only a day away

376
00:14:44,504 --> 00:14:47,645
from meeting the adoptive
parents, Brandon and Teresa.

377
00:14:47,748 --> 00:14:49,405
What happens if we meet them,
and, like--

378
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:51,442
- [together] We don't like 'em.
- Yeah.

379
00:14:51,545 --> 00:14:52,615
What if they're really
snobby people?

380
00:14:52,719 --> 00:14:54,583
But he just seems very, like--
- Dorky.

381
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:55,446
- Mm-hmm.

382
00:14:55,549 --> 00:14:57,931
Dorky, but that's all right.

383
00:14:58,035 --> 00:14:59,829
She can have a dorky dad.

384
00:14:59,933 --> 00:15:02,453
- She's gonna be really loved
and cared for and watched out

385
00:15:02,556 --> 00:15:03,799
for.

386
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,801
- When she's older, and, like,
she's, like, our age,

387
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,699
and if she wants to come visit
for, like, the summer

388
00:15:07,803 --> 00:15:09,115
or something.

389
00:15:09,218 --> 00:15:11,117
You know, she might be 18,
and she might just want to come

390
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,533
stay with us.

391
00:15:13,636 --> 00:15:15,293
- Maybe.

392
00:15:15,397 --> 00:15:18,469
- You never know.

393
00:15:18,572 --> 00:15:21,368
The prospect of meeting Brandon
and Teresa for the first time

394
00:15:21,472 --> 00:15:24,268
is making me seriously anxious.

395
00:15:24,371 --> 00:15:26,408
I texted my mom to see
if she wanted to come,

396
00:15:26,511 --> 00:15:27,892
and she was not happy.

397
00:15:27,996 --> 00:15:30,032
Here's mom.

398
00:15:30,136 --> 00:15:32,897
Hi, mom.
- Mom!

399
00:15:37,867 --> 00:15:39,731
Through this whole time that
you've been pregnant, she's,

400
00:15:39,835 --> 00:15:41,595
like, "I just have a funny
feeling she's just not gonna

401
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:43,425
end up giving her up
for adoption."

402
00:15:43,528 --> 00:15:45,427
- Who, me?
- Yeah.

403
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:46,738
- That I'm not going to
or I am?

404
00:15:46,842 --> 00:15:47,498
- Mm-hmm.

405
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:49,534
- That I'm not going to?

406
00:15:49,638 --> 00:15:51,467
- She's, like, "I just have--
I just have this feeling.

407
00:15:51,571 --> 00:15:53,193
She's just not gonna end up
giving her up for adoption."

408
00:15:53,297 --> 00:15:55,437
- [sighs]

409
00:15:58,198 --> 00:16:00,960
Now that the day to meet
the adoptive parents is here,

410
00:16:01,063 --> 00:16:02,409
I'm even more nervous.

411
00:16:02,513 --> 00:16:04,032
I just hope we like them.

412
00:16:06,724 --> 00:16:08,415
- Hey, Brandon and Teresa.

413
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,383
This is Tyler.
- Hey, Tyler.

414
00:16:10,486 --> 00:16:11,901
- How are you doing?
- Hi.

415
00:16:12,005 --> 00:16:13,248
- Hi.
- I get the hug?

416
00:16:13,351 --> 00:16:14,456
- Yeah, you get the hug.

417
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:15,871
- Good to see you.
- It's good to see you.

418
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,735
- So good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

419
00:16:17,838 --> 00:16:20,013
- Hi. [giggling]

420
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:23,706
My heart's racing.

421
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:24,707
- I know it.

422
00:16:24,811 --> 00:16:27,607
- [giggles]
- You can sit there.

423
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,229
You guys have a seat here.

424
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,679
- Okay.

425
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:31,680
- Okay.

426
00:16:31,783 --> 00:16:32,888
- It's good to meet y'all.

427
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:34,717
- I know; it's really nice
to meet you guys.

428
00:16:34,821 --> 00:16:36,754
- The buildup to this, I mean,
we've been hearing about y'all

429
00:16:36,857 --> 00:16:38,790
for the last few weeks.
Just time to meet.

430
00:16:38,894 --> 00:16:40,240
Just time to get in front
of you, say hello.

431
00:16:40,344 --> 00:16:41,483
So we're glad to be here.

432
00:16:41,586 --> 00:16:43,381
- What--how many weeks are you
now, Catelynn?

433
00:16:43,485 --> 00:16:44,900
- 31.
- Yep, 31 weeks.

434
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,936
- So we have nine weeks
till d-day.

435
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,629
So we're just gonna spend some
time getting to know each other.

436
00:16:49,732 --> 00:16:53,564
And I'll just ask questions
and put you all on the hot seat.

437
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:55,290
Brandon, tell us how you guys
met each other.

438
00:16:55,393 --> 00:16:58,638
- Teresa and I met, actually,
at church in our hometown.

439
00:16:58,741 --> 00:17:00,640
Some mutual friends
introduced us.

440
00:17:00,743 --> 00:17:03,125
- What do you guys do
for work, for employment?

441
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:05,679
- I work for a small
financial services company.

442
00:17:05,783 --> 00:17:08,475
- And I work for a private
Christian school.

443
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:11,202
- So what brought you to
an adoption decision?

444
00:17:11,306 --> 00:17:13,480
- When we got married,
we started trying to have

445
00:17:13,584 --> 00:17:16,414
children, and, um,
just have not been able

446
00:17:16,518 --> 00:17:17,898
to have children.

447
00:17:18,002 --> 00:17:21,661
And so I have just felt for
several years that there's

448
00:17:21,764 --> 00:17:23,663
a child that we're gonna have
through adoption,

449
00:17:23,766 --> 00:17:25,803
and that's the right plan
for us.

450
00:17:25,906 --> 00:17:28,254
- So I wanted you guys
to kind of tell them too

451
00:17:28,357 --> 00:17:32,085
what you're thinking in terms
of, you know, pictures and

452
00:17:32,189 --> 00:17:34,881
letters and kind of updates
and getting information.

453
00:17:34,984 --> 00:17:36,986
- Personally, I want to be able
to, like, you know, like,

454
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:39,437
send her birthday presents,
'cause I will do that

455
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:40,611
every year.

456
00:17:40,714 --> 00:17:41,819
I'd be, like,
"Got to go shopping.

457
00:17:41,922 --> 00:17:43,717
Got to go get something
for her."

458
00:17:43,821 --> 00:17:45,305
I want her to know that
I'm still there.

459
00:17:45,409 --> 00:17:48,205
Like, I didn't just, like,
not care about her, like--

460
00:17:48,308 --> 00:17:49,758
- It makes sense.

461
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,104
I think having correspondence,
interaction, certainly pictures,

462
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:53,141
and kind of whatever we can do,
it makes all the sense

463
00:17:53,244 --> 00:17:54,590
in the world.

464
00:17:54,694 --> 00:17:57,800
- I have a feeling we would
take tons and tons of pictures.

465
00:17:57,904 --> 00:17:59,733
- What are your goals, then?

466
00:17:59,837 --> 00:18:02,219
What kind of things are you
looking towards in the future?

467
00:18:02,322 --> 00:18:04,911
- I really want my daughter to,
like, live in a household where

468
00:18:05,014 --> 00:18:07,293
she's raised in a household
and she's not moving

469
00:18:07,396 --> 00:18:08,742
like I've moved my whole life.

470
00:18:08,846 --> 00:18:10,951
Like, I don't really have, like,
a really good, stable household.

471
00:18:11,055 --> 00:18:15,404
Like, my mom, she used to have
problems, and I had, um--

472
00:18:15,508 --> 00:18:17,337
I had to live, like,
go move in with my grandparents

473
00:18:17,441 --> 00:18:19,374
and live with them for
seven months 'cause I couldn't

474
00:18:19,477 --> 00:18:20,582
live where I was living.

475
00:18:20,685 --> 00:18:23,412
And, um, sorry.
- It's okay.

476
00:18:23,516 --> 00:18:24,344
- And, um...

477
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:25,345
[sighs]

478
00:18:28,969 --> 00:18:31,972
I just want her to have better
than what I had,

479
00:18:32,076 --> 00:18:35,873
and I know that I can't do that.

480
00:18:35,976 --> 00:18:40,084
So I'm just doing the thing
that I think is the best.

481
00:18:40,188 --> 00:18:42,569
And I know that you guys
can provide for her a lot more

482
00:18:42,673 --> 00:18:44,468
than I can.

483
00:18:44,571 --> 00:18:47,988
So I don't know.

484
00:18:48,092 --> 00:18:49,058
- It's okay.

485
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:51,095
- [sniffles]

486
00:18:59,379 --> 00:19:01,657
- After our meeting with
Brandon and Teresa,

487
00:19:01,761 --> 00:19:02,865
Dawn wanted to see how we felt.

488
00:19:02,969 --> 00:19:05,144
- So how did you feel?

489
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:06,145
- I feel like I know them.

490
00:19:06,248 --> 00:19:07,767
- They're gonna be awesome
parents.

491
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:09,769
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah, they are.

492
00:19:09,872 --> 00:19:11,322
- And I just loved that too,
like, right when I came in here,

493
00:19:11,426 --> 00:19:14,946
she just, like, hugged me
so tight, like, she's, like--

494
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,327
Really loving people.

495
00:19:16,431 --> 00:19:17,535
You can just tell.

496
00:19:17,639 --> 00:19:18,916
- Okay, well, good.

497
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:21,229
We'll consider it an official
match, and we'll just keep

498
00:19:21,332 --> 00:19:22,885
plugging along here,
moving forward.

499
00:19:22,989 --> 00:19:24,335
- Mm-hmm. Definitely.

500
00:19:24,439 --> 00:19:26,337
I really like it.

501
00:19:31,031 --> 00:19:33,206
[cell phone chirps]
It's my mom.

502
00:19:33,310 --> 00:19:35,277
- Whoa.
- She decided to call me back.

503
00:19:35,381 --> 00:19:37,245
Hello, mother.

504
00:19:40,248 --> 00:19:44,079
- Um, I went to go meet
the parents.

505
00:19:45,908 --> 00:19:49,153
- Oh, well, I thought I already
told--

506
00:19:51,638 --> 00:19:53,122
Bye.
- Bye.

507
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:54,262
- What did she say?

508
00:19:54,365 --> 00:19:55,401
- Nothing.

509
00:19:55,504 --> 00:19:56,643
She goes--she goes,
"You didn't even tell me

510
00:19:56,747 --> 00:19:58,197
that you were going to meet
the parents today.

511
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,128
Thanks for bringing me."

512
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:00,613
- Yes, you did.

513
00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:03,512
- And obviously, I didn't.

514
00:20:03,616 --> 00:20:06,446
It sucks not having my mom
on my side.

515
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:10,485
I just hope she comes around
before the baby is born.

516
00:20:10,588 --> 00:20:13,004
Over the next few weeks,
I tried to focus on

517
00:20:13,108 --> 00:20:14,385
the good things.

518
00:20:14,489 --> 00:20:16,456
Tyler and I spent more time
getting to know Brandon

519
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,630
and Teresa.

520
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:19,045
- Good to see you guys.
- It's been forever.

521
00:20:19,148 --> 00:20:20,322
- I know. I know.

522
00:20:20,426 --> 00:20:21,910
- They picked out a name
that we like: Carolyn,

523
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:23,256
Carly, for short.

524
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,533
We sewed a baby blanket.

525
00:20:24,637 --> 00:20:25,534
- Too cute. Love it.

526
00:20:25,638 --> 00:20:26,570
- That is really cute.

527
00:20:26,673 --> 00:20:27,985
- And made a scrapbook
for the baby.

528
00:20:28,088 --> 00:20:29,918
- Yeah, I think it's important
for her to be able to, like,

529
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:32,645
see what we look like, and--
- What everybody looks like.

530
00:20:32,748 --> 00:20:35,441
Before I knew it, my due date
was around the corner,

531
00:20:35,544 --> 00:20:38,237
and to my total surprise,
I went to the doctor,

532
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:42,551
and she told me she would
induce labor in three days.

533
00:20:42,655 --> 00:20:45,520
[phone ringing]

534
00:20:47,763 --> 00:20:49,627
Hi.

535
00:20:49,731 --> 00:20:51,595
- Do you have something
to tell me?

536
00:20:51,698 --> 00:20:54,460
- Yes. I went
to the doctor's today.

537
00:20:54,563 --> 00:20:55,875
- And?

538
00:20:55,978 --> 00:20:57,670
- I'm getting induced
on Monday.

539
00:20:57,773 --> 00:20:59,982
- Really?
- Yes.

540
00:21:00,086 --> 00:21:01,846
- Oh, my goodness.
How do you feel?

541
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:03,676
- [laughs]
- Are you nervous?

542
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:05,022
- Yeah, I'm nervous.

543
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:07,473
- Maybe--maybe we can get up
there in time and we won't

544
00:21:07,576 --> 00:21:08,405
miss it.

545
00:21:08,508 --> 00:21:09,578
- Yeah.

546
00:21:09,682 --> 00:21:12,788
[door slams sharply]
Are you locking me out?

547
00:21:14,859 --> 00:21:17,448
- [sobs]
- You okay?

548
00:21:17,552 --> 00:21:20,658
- No.

549
00:21:20,762 --> 00:21:21,487
- Don't sit in here.

550
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,627
You're making me feel bad.

551
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:30,875
- [sniffles]
- It'll be all right, Ma.

552
00:21:36,364 --> 00:21:38,607
Since we're going to
the hospital Monday morning,

553
00:21:38,711 --> 00:21:41,300
Tyler decided to write a letter
to our daughter so she will

554
00:21:41,403 --> 00:21:44,648
always know where she comes from
and that she is loved.

555
00:21:44,751 --> 00:21:46,753
I want to hear what it--
yours says.

556
00:21:46,857 --> 00:21:48,272
- Okay.

557
00:21:48,376 --> 00:21:50,930
"first off, I want to tell you
I love you so much.

558
00:21:51,033 --> 00:21:54,589
Words can never explain the love
a father has for his daughter.

559
00:21:54,692 --> 00:21:57,108
When your mom and I found out
she was pregnant with you,

560
00:21:57,212 --> 00:21:58,765
we didn't know what we
were going to do.

561
00:21:58,869 --> 00:22:01,458
We were so young and
inexperienced in life yet.

562
00:22:01,561 --> 00:22:03,667
After thinking and thinking,
we came to the decision that

563
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:06,014
adoption was the best choice
for you.

564
00:22:06,117 --> 00:22:08,913
The thought of what kind of dad
I wanted to be and what you

565
00:22:09,017 --> 00:22:11,571
deserve in life just didn't mix.

566
00:22:11,675 --> 00:22:13,297
I think about you every day.

567
00:22:13,401 --> 00:22:15,472
You are everything to me.

568
00:22:15,575 --> 00:22:18,095
I don't ever, ever want you
to think I didn't want you.

569
00:22:18,198 --> 00:22:19,061
I will always love you.

570
00:22:19,165 --> 00:22:20,442
You are in my thoughts
every day.

571
00:22:20,546 --> 00:22:22,202
Love, your daddy."

572
00:22:22,306 --> 00:22:23,203
- That's sad.

573
00:22:23,307 --> 00:22:25,344
You're gonna make me cry.

574
00:22:29,417 --> 00:22:31,142
Come here.

575
00:22:31,246 --> 00:22:33,352
Give me a hug.

576
00:22:46,848 --> 00:22:49,747
- I don't know.

577
00:22:49,851 --> 00:22:51,853
But it's so hard
to give her away.

578
00:22:53,855 --> 00:22:55,684
- I know. It's gonna be
really hard.

579
00:22:55,788 --> 00:22:57,410
- And now it's getting
so close.

580
00:22:57,514 --> 00:23:00,068
It's, like, the reality
is really starting to hit.

581
00:23:00,171 --> 00:23:02,104
[inhales]

582
00:23:04,866 --> 00:23:08,076
- Like, you always tell me
we can do this, right?

583
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:09,664
- Yeah.
- We have to do this.

584
00:23:09,767 --> 00:23:12,667
- This is what we prepared for.

585
00:23:16,533 --> 00:23:18,362
- But it doesn't matter
how ready we are,

586
00:23:18,466 --> 00:23:19,432
because ready or not...

587
00:23:19,536 --> 00:23:21,434
[chime dings]
this baby's coming.

588
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,926
- I can't believe I'm on my way
to the hospital to be induced

589
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:33,757
and that I'm going to give birth
sometime today.

590
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:36,380
I've been through so much
already, and I still feel

591
00:23:36,484 --> 00:23:38,796
totally unprepared.

592
00:23:43,801 --> 00:23:45,838
[woman speaking indistinctly]

593
00:23:48,979 --> 00:23:50,498
- Do you have a problem
with IVs?

594
00:23:50,601 --> 00:23:51,982
- No, I just don't like
needles.

595
00:23:52,085 --> 00:23:53,846
- Okay, then don't watch.
- Once it's in, I'm done.

596
00:23:53,949 --> 00:23:57,746
- Okay. I'm gonna
draw your blood.

597
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,127
So you're gonna feel it
move around.

598
00:23:59,230 --> 00:24:01,301
It's gonna feel weird.
- Okay.

599
00:24:01,405 --> 00:24:04,650
- Every half hour, we're gonna
put the pitocin dose up.

600
00:24:04,753 --> 00:24:05,789
- Does that make my
contractions or something?

601
00:24:05,892 --> 00:24:07,273
- It will make your
contractions.

602
00:24:07,376 --> 00:24:09,240
- 'Cause I've already felt that
they were already getting

603
00:24:09,344 --> 00:24:11,208
a little bit worse,
unless that's in my mind.

604
00:24:11,311 --> 00:24:12,761
It feels like I had
a little one.

605
00:24:12,865 --> 00:24:13,693
- A little contraction?

606
00:24:13,797 --> 00:24:15,764
- Mm-hmm.

607
00:24:15,868 --> 00:24:17,525
- [heartbeat thumping]

608
00:24:17,628 --> 00:24:19,285
- How far apart are they?

609
00:24:19,388 --> 00:24:20,355
They're not that far apart.

610
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:21,667
- Uh-uh.

611
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:23,082
- Yay.

612
00:24:23,185 --> 00:24:24,635
Then they're gonna come in
here and...

613
00:24:24,739 --> 00:24:25,602
- Boost it up more.

614
00:24:25,705 --> 00:24:26,775
- Mm-hmm.

615
00:24:26,879 --> 00:24:28,052
- Knock, knock.

616
00:24:28,156 --> 00:24:28,881
- Hi.

617
00:24:28,984 --> 00:24:30,503
- Hey, how you doing?

618
00:24:30,607 --> 00:24:31,573
- All right, I guess.

619
00:24:31,677 --> 00:24:33,023
- Yeah?

620
00:24:33,126 --> 00:24:34,852
What I'd like to do is
go ahead and check your cervix,

621
00:24:34,956 --> 00:24:36,509
and I want to break your water
for you.

622
00:24:36,613 --> 00:24:37,890
- All right.

623
00:24:37,993 --> 00:24:39,236
- Once we break your water,
there's no turning back.

624
00:24:39,339 --> 00:24:41,065
Okay, now I'm going to break
your water, so you'll feel

625
00:24:41,169 --> 00:24:43,689
pressure here, and just again,
feel your muscles.

626
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:45,518
Let them fall into the bed.

627
00:24:45,622 --> 00:24:47,244
Perfect. Pressure now.

628
00:24:47,347 --> 00:24:49,108
And that's your water.

629
00:24:49,211 --> 00:24:50,178
Here you go.

630
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:51,317
And the fluid--
- God, it feels like

631
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:53,215
I'm peeing myself.
- I need a towel, please.

632
00:24:53,319 --> 00:24:54,631
- Okay.

633
00:24:54,734 --> 00:24:57,806
- There you go.

634
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:58,773
You're doing good.

635
00:24:58,876 --> 00:25:00,637
Hang in there.

636
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:01,810
We waited nine months for this.

637
00:25:01,914 --> 00:25:03,709
- Yeah.

638
00:25:03,812 --> 00:25:06,919
[exhales]

639
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,716
- Okay, honey.

640
00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:13,822
- [breathing deeply]

641
00:25:17,377 --> 00:25:22,313
[sniffles]
[heartbeat pulses on monitor]

642
00:25:22,417 --> 00:25:24,005
- Oh, honey.

643
00:25:24,108 --> 00:25:25,938
- [sighs]
- I love you.

644
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:29,528
- I love you too.

645
00:25:29,631 --> 00:25:33,083
- It's gonna get better.

646
00:25:33,186 --> 00:25:36,189
- Once you get your epidural,
there's gonna be a pump

647
00:25:36,293 --> 00:25:37,846
hooked up--
- [sighs] Sorry.

648
00:25:37,950 --> 00:25:40,918
- That's okay. You can
breathe through it.

649
00:25:41,022 --> 00:25:44,577
Just keep breathing.
You're doing great.

650
00:25:44,681 --> 00:25:47,200
You're doing great.

651
00:25:47,304 --> 00:25:51,135
- [exhales]
- There you go.

652
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:52,723
It's at its worst right now.

653
00:25:52,827 --> 00:25:56,313
It's gonna be coming down.

654
00:25:56,416 --> 00:25:58,004
- Is she getting the epidural
now?

655
00:25:58,108 --> 00:25:59,488
- Yeah.
- Yep. Yep.

656
00:25:59,592 --> 00:26:02,526
They're right outside the door.
- Okay.

657
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:04,355
- I will--

658
00:26:04,459 --> 00:26:06,047
Breathe, Cate.
- Mom, it frickin' hurts.

659
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:07,980
- You got to breathe, Cate.

660
00:26:11,639 --> 00:26:13,951
- I got my epidural
while Tyler went to meet

661
00:26:14,055 --> 00:26:16,022
Brandon and Teresa,
who were going to wait

662
00:26:16,126 --> 00:26:17,817
in the reception area.

663
00:26:17,921 --> 00:26:19,094
- Hi, guys.
- How you feeeling?

664
00:26:19,198 --> 00:26:20,924
You doing all right?
- Yeah.

665
00:26:21,027 --> 00:26:23,167
- Hanging in there?
- Hanging in there.

666
00:26:23,271 --> 00:26:25,135
Yeah, trying to, at least.

667
00:26:25,238 --> 00:26:26,239
Trying to hang in there.

668
00:26:26,343 --> 00:26:27,862
- Ty, you're a little pale.
- Yeah.

669
00:26:27,965 --> 00:26:30,174
- Got a little pale.
- Yeah.

670
00:26:30,278 --> 00:26:31,831
They checked her just now,
and she's between five and six.

671
00:26:31,935 --> 00:26:33,419
- And she's right between
five and six?

672
00:26:33,522 --> 00:26:35,559
- And she's 100% effaced.
- That's good.

673
00:26:35,663 --> 00:26:38,148
She's definitely progressing,
then.

674
00:26:38,251 --> 00:26:40,702
Like, who else is upstairs?

675
00:26:40,806 --> 00:26:42,980
- My mom, her mom, and Sarah.

676
00:26:43,084 --> 00:26:46,018
- Do they know we're coming?
- Yeah, yes.

677
00:26:46,121 --> 00:26:48,434
[laughter]
- I hope I'm not getting

678
00:26:48,537 --> 00:26:50,919
everyone freaked out,
but they told me.

679
00:26:51,023 --> 00:26:52,196
It's--she's at 9 1/2.

680
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,819
It's, like, okay.

681
00:26:57,788 --> 00:26:59,514
- Yeah.
- Oh, my.

682
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:02,828
- I'm shocked.

683
00:27:02,931 --> 00:27:03,898
- You're at 9 1/2?

684
00:27:04,001 --> 00:27:05,071
- Mm-hmm.

685
00:27:05,175 --> 00:27:07,349
- Holy crap.

686
00:27:07,453 --> 00:27:09,558
How are you feeling?
- All right.

687
00:27:09,662 --> 00:27:12,561
I'm glad I had her check me
again.

688
00:27:12,665 --> 00:27:13,804
- How are you?

689
00:27:13,908 --> 00:27:15,012
- Are you feeling the urge?

690
00:27:15,116 --> 00:27:16,945
- Yeah.

691
00:27:17,049 --> 00:27:19,638
[exhales]
Yeah.

692
00:27:19,741 --> 00:27:22,088
- Okay, I called Dr. Niver,
and she's coming up.

693
00:27:22,192 --> 00:27:23,642
- I'm feeling the urge
right now.

694
00:27:23,745 --> 00:27:25,057
Like, I am, bad.

695
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,783
- I know.

696
00:27:26,886 --> 00:27:28,785

697
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:32,858
Hi.

698
00:27:34,894 --> 00:27:36,171
- Yeah.

699
00:27:36,275 --> 00:27:38,346
- That's good.

700
00:27:38,449 --> 00:27:40,589
- So, Tyler, you're gonna help
her hold one of her legs?

701
00:27:40,693 --> 00:27:41,936
- Okay.

702
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:43,247
- Okay, I'm gonna have you
come over on the left here.

703
00:27:43,351 --> 00:27:45,146
We'll have Tracy over here.

704
00:27:45,249 --> 00:27:47,493
You're gonna bring them
up and out.

705
00:27:47,596 --> 00:27:49,426
You're gonna take a deep
breath in, and you're gonna

706
00:27:49,529 --> 00:27:51,497
push down right on your bottom
like a bowel movement

707
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:52,498
would feel.

708
00:27:52,601 --> 00:27:53,568
Do you feel like you
need to do it?

709
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:55,190
- Yeah.
- Let me get some gloves on.

710
00:27:55,294 --> 00:27:56,951
And we'll try.

711
00:27:57,054 --> 00:27:58,469
Just breathe.

712
00:27:58,573 --> 00:28:00,368
Doing--
your baby's head's nice

713
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:02,025
and low, so you're gonna do
great with this.

714
00:28:02,128 --> 00:28:03,405
All right.
- Yeah.

715
00:28:03,509 --> 00:28:06,823
- Put my game clothes on.

716
00:28:06,926 --> 00:28:07,996
Now, remember what I said.

717
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,549
Knees this way.

718
00:28:09,653 --> 00:28:10,896
More. More.

719
00:28:10,999 --> 00:28:12,069
Perfect.

720
00:28:12,173 --> 00:28:14,071
Now, right now,
take a deep breath in.

721
00:28:14,175 --> 00:28:15,176
Hold your breath.

722
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,073
And push down right here.

723
00:28:16,177 --> 00:28:17,247
Push.

724
00:28:17,350 --> 00:28:19,249
Even more.

725
00:28:19,352 --> 00:28:20,215
You're doing great, Catelynn.

726
00:28:20,319 --> 00:28:22,321
Harder. Harder.

727
00:28:22,424 --> 00:28:23,874
Perfect. You're doing awesome.

- Okay, let it go.

730
00:28:26,428 --> 00:28:28,637
Another breath in.

731
00:28:28,741 --> 00:28:29,984
Push down hard.

732
00:28:30,087 --> 00:28:32,089
Two, three.

733
00:28:32,193 --> 00:28:33,366
Stronger. Four.

734
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:34,954
That's okay. Five, right here.

735
00:28:35,058 --> 00:28:36,956
Hold on. Seven, eight.

736
00:28:37,060 --> 00:28:38,302
Push, push, push, nine.

737
00:28:38,406 --> 00:28:39,821
Ten, let it go.

00:28:45,068 --> 00:28:46,310
Pull those legs back.

742

Push down. Right there.

743
00:28:49,072 --> 00:28:50,832
Four, pour it out.
Five, we're moving her.

744
00:28:50,936 --> 00:28:51,764
Six, keep going.

745
00:28:51,868 --> 00:28:52,800
Seven, don't stop.

746
00:28:52,903 --> 00:28:53,766

00:28:56,942 --> 00:29:00,117
- Okay, another try.
Another breath. Big breath.

749
00:29:00,221 --> 00:29:01,670
- You ready?
- And go, there we go.

750
00:29:01,774 --> 00:29:03,396
There we go, honey.
- Eight, lots of pressure.

751
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,191
- And there we go, honey.

752
00:29:05,295 --> 00:29:06,952
- Let it go.

753
00:29:07,055 --> 00:29:08,160
You're okay.

754
00:29:08,263 --> 00:29:09,540
- It's okay. It's okay.
It's okay. It's okay.

755
00:29:09,644 --> 00:29:11,542
You're doing good.
You're doing--

756
00:29:11,646 --> 00:29:13,372
You're doing really good, honey.

757
00:29:13,475 --> 00:29:15,408
You're doing so good, honey.

758
00:29:15,512 --> 00:29:16,927
- Now, I want you to open
your eyes.

759
00:29:17,031 --> 00:29:18,757
I want you to open your eyes,
and I want you to look

760
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:20,482
right down here.
- I don't want to see.

761
00:29:20,586 --> 00:29:22,001
- Look, Cate.
- Open your eyes.

762
00:29:22,105 --> 00:29:24,038
- I don't want to see.
- No, she doesn't want to see.

763
00:29:24,141 --> 00:29:26,937
- Then just push. Go ahead.
Push her out. That's it.

764
00:29:27,041 --> 00:29:28,318
- Okay.

765
00:29:28,421 --> 00:29:31,355
[all gasping]
- There she is. You did great.

766
00:29:31,459 --> 00:29:33,012
Hey, baby.

767
00:29:33,116 --> 00:29:34,738
Aren't you cute?

768
00:29:35,843 --> 00:29:37,672
- Just sucking her nose out.

769
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,398
Catelynn, you want
to take a look?

770
00:29:39,501 --> 00:29:42,056
You want to take a look?
- No.

771
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:44,403
- She's beautiful.
- Aw.

772
00:29:44,506 --> 00:29:46,612
- All right.

773
00:29:53,550 --> 00:29:55,655
- Standing by.

774
00:29:57,278 --> 00:29:58,520
- Fresh from god.

775
00:29:58,624 --> 00:30:00,729
There you go, love.

776
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,113
- I know.

777
00:30:15,261 --> 00:30:16,469
- It's okay. I'm fine.

778
00:30:16,573 --> 00:30:18,402
- She's okay.
Support her, honey.

779
00:30:18,506 --> 00:30:19,403
Don't think about yourself.

780
00:30:19,507 --> 00:30:20,991
- I'm fine.

781
00:30:21,095 --> 00:30:22,924
I'm all right, okay?

- Just sore.

786
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,513
- Yeah.

787
00:31:00,617 --> 00:31:03,447
- Did you see it?

788
00:31:03,551 --> 00:31:05,242
- I'm shaking so bad.

789
00:31:05,346 --> 00:31:08,349
- I know.

790
00:31:08,452 --> 00:31:10,075
- Did you take pictures?

791
00:31:10,178 --> 00:31:12,871
- They're all down there
taking pictures now.

792
00:31:17,323 --> 00:31:18,359
- Good-bye.

793
00:31:20,913 --> 00:31:22,501
Don't worry.
- Don't even think about it.

794
00:31:24,468 --> 00:31:26,298
- I kind of want to see her.

795
00:31:29,646 --> 00:31:32,511
- I think so too. I feel it.

796
00:31:32,614 --> 00:31:35,514
Even though I said Brandon
and Teresa could hold the baby

797
00:31:35,617 --> 00:31:38,689
right away, I wanted
to be the first to hold her.

798
00:31:38,793 --> 00:31:40,277
- Hey.
- All right.

799
00:31:40,381 --> 00:31:41,623
- What's the story?

800
00:31:41,727 --> 00:31:45,006
- Well, she--Catelynn just
had her, and she's healthy,

801
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:46,318
and everything's good.

802
00:31:46,421 --> 00:31:48,803
She wanted to, um,
see her real quick

803
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,494
and just hold her
and say whatever.

804
00:31:50,598 --> 00:31:51,979
- She does?

805
00:31:52,082 --> 00:31:53,704
- And then after she's done
with her, she kind of wants,

806
00:31:53,808 --> 00:31:55,534
you know, to let you guys
can hold her.

807
00:31:55,637 --> 00:31:57,294
- Okay.
- Yeah, that'll be easy.

808

I bet none of us
will be crying through that.

Where is she now?
- She's in the nursery.

810
00:32:01,264 --> 00:32:03,266
- Okay. Have you held her yet?

00:32:03,369 --> 00:32:04,750

we can.

You're right.
She looks like you.

- Yeah, I'll hold her.

- Hi, little one.

837
00:33:22,276 --> 00:33:24,416
Even though Butch isn't here
and my mom's making herself

838
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:28,834
scarce, my friends came
to the hospital to see the baby.

839
00:33:28,937 --> 00:33:31,319
- Oh.
- Hi, Tyler.

840
00:33:31,423 --> 00:33:32,079
How are you?

00:33:32,182 --> 00:33:33,287
- Oh, my god.

00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:35,875
It's good to see you
out of Catelynn's belly.

- Are you okay?

- Hi.

845
00:33:42,882 --> 00:33:45,368
What I would--I was just
wondering if I could talk

846
00:33:45,471 --> 00:33:47,887
to you and Tyler for just
a minute.

847
00:33:47,991 --> 00:33:50,649
Since we're five hours out
from delivery, I was wondering

848
00:33:50,752 --> 00:33:53,928
if you would feel comfortable
for--with us, like, taking

849
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,172
a time-out from friends
and family, and you going ahead

850
00:33:56,275 --> 00:33:58,243
and doing with Brandon
and Teresa.

851
00:33:58,346 --> 00:33:59,623
So what do you think?

852
00:33:59,727 --> 00:34:01,349
- All right, well, I want
to get pictures with Ty first.

853
00:34:01,453 --> 00:34:02,799
- Right.

854
00:34:02,902 --> 00:34:04,870
- So I'll just tell them--
I'll just try to entertain them

855
00:34:04,973 --> 00:34:06,527
and hold them off for--

856
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:08,425
- Oh, it'll only be, like,
ten more minutes, I think.

857
00:34:08,529 --> 00:34:09,909
- Okay, all right.
- Yeah.

858
00:34:10,013 --> 00:34:11,877
- Okay.

859
00:34:14,017 --> 00:34:17,089
- Do you want to hand her off
or...

860
00:34:17,193 --> 00:34:18,332
- I don't care.

861
00:34:18,435 --> 00:34:20,506

- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

865
00:34:32,898 --> 00:34:34,486
- How are you?
- Good.

866
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:35,487
- Hi.

867
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:36,591
- We saw her through
the window.

868
00:34:36,695 --> 00:34:38,386
- I know. I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

Hi, baby girl.

Wait, don't start crying on me.

Hi, precious.

Hi.

You're so pretty.

877
00:35:00,374 --> 00:35:01,858
- I don't know if you've
seen her eyes yet or not.

878
00:35:01,961 --> 00:35:04,481
Has she opened her eyes at all?
- She opened her eyes.

879
00:35:04,585 --> 00:35:05,620
- In here?
- Yeah, it's in the bag.

880
00:35:05,724 --> 00:35:07,622
- Here, I'll pull the card out.

881
00:35:07,726 --> 00:35:09,659
I'll give this to you,
and I'll let you read the card,

882
00:35:09,762 --> 00:35:13,145
and then I can kind of
further explain it.

883
00:35:13,249 --> 00:35:15,285
- Moving around a little bit.

884
00:35:18,944 --> 00:35:20,842
- It's pretty.

885
00:35:26,469 --> 00:35:27,642
- That's my little--

886
00:35:27,746 --> 00:35:29,334
- I like that.

887
00:35:29,437 --> 00:35:30,369

889
00:35:31,991 --> 00:35:33,165
"Always in my heart."

890
00:35:33,269 --> 00:35:35,133
- I have one too.

891
00:35:35,236 --> 00:35:40,621
And we have one for Carly too.

892
00:35:40,724 --> 00:35:42,450
And, um...

893
00:35:42,554 --> 00:35:47,041
So the plan is that I will
always be wearing mine,

894
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:50,493
and you can be wearing yours,
and then when she's old enough,

895
00:35:50,596 --> 00:35:53,047
we'll give her hers as well
to wear.

896
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,154
We're just so gonna be linked
for life, and we just can't

897
00:35:56,257 --> 00:35:58,915
thank you enough for, um...

898
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,402
For this gift.

899
00:36:03,506 --> 00:36:05,473
We just want you to know
that you will always be

900
00:36:05,577 --> 00:36:07,026
in our hearts.

901
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:08,442
- I'm never gonna take it off.

902
00:36:08,545 --> 00:36:10,271
- I'm never gonna take mine off
either.

903
00:36:10,375 --> 00:36:14,827
And it'll be really special
for her when she gets old enough

904
00:36:14,931 --> 00:36:18,555
to know that--that--
how much we love her,

905
00:36:18,659 --> 00:36:23,008
but also just how much
you guys love her as well.

906
00:36:23,111 --> 00:36:25,424
- That means so much.

907
00:36:34,882 --> 00:36:36,987
- We needed my mom to sign
the adoption papers

908
00:36:37,091 --> 00:36:39,990
in order to give Brandon
and Teresa the baby that day,

909
00:36:40,094 --> 00:36:43,304

the handoff could not happen

You guys getting ready to roll?

All right.
You're gonna be okay, right?

a ride on the elevator.

928
00:37:53,340 --> 00:37:55,445
- Okay.

00:37:55,549 --> 00:37:56,688

00:38:22,852 --> 00:38:27,408

See you later. See you later.

- Bye.

That's good.

having a baby inside of you

950
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:28,469
for nine months and getting that
connection and wondering what

951
00:39:28,573 --> 00:39:31,196
she's gonna look like
or who she's gonna look like

952
00:39:31,299 --> 00:39:32,991
and then just giving her
to somebody that you

953
00:39:33,094 --> 00:39:34,372
barely even know.

954
00:39:34,475 --> 00:39:37,098
It took a lot of strength
for me not to take her home

00:39:37,202 --> 00:39:38,306

household.

00:39:43,346 --> 00:39:44,451
I didn't have two parents.

960

I think she's gonna have
a really great life,

961
00:39:46,694 --> 00:39:49,248
because Brandon and Teresa
are really awesome people.

962
00:39:49,352 --> 00:39:51,250
I'm really interested to see
what she's gonna be like

963
00:39:51,354 --> 00:39:53,805
when she's older too,
like, if she's in gymnastics

964
00:39:53,908 --> 00:39:56,428
or if she's a runner
like Teresa.

965
00:39:56,532 --> 00:39:58,844
Maybe one day when she's older,
we might be able to get

966
00:39:58,948 --> 00:40:00,225
to know each other.

968
00:40:03,987 --> 00:40:04,954
It hurts my feelings that

969
00:40:05,057 --> 00:40:06,438
my mom doesn't support me.

970
00:40:06,542 --> 00:40:08,820
It's kind of hard to deal
with that, because your mom,

971
00:40:08,923 --> 00:40:11,478
out of all people, should be,
like, your number one supporter.

972
00:40:11,581 --> 00:40:14,550
Getting pregnant at 16,
I really wasn't ready for it.

973
00:40:14,653 --> 00:40:17,587
It made me want to make
my life better, go to college,

get an education.

And me and Ty, we've gotten
a lot closer through this

978
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:27,390
whole experience, and he's still
the love of my life,

979
00:40:27,494 --> 00:40:30,255
and hopefully one day
me and him will get older

980
00:40:30,358 --> 00:40:32,706
and have kids together.

981
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:35,363
Giving my child up for adoption
was the hardest thing that I'll

982
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:37,227
ever have to do in my life.

983
00:40:37,331 --> 00:40:39,264
Nobody wants to give their child
away.

I just did what my heart
told me to do.

985
00:40:41,784 --> 00:40:45,719
I think that Carly's gonna
one day come to me and Tyler

986
00:40:45,822 --> 00:40:48,791
and tell us, "Thank you."

987

- It's better without a condom.
- Don't listen to that.
