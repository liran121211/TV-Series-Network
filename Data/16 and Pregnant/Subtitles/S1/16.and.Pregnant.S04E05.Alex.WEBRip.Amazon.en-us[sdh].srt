1
00:00:03,037 --> 00:00:04,349
>> [laughs]

2
00:00:04,349 --> 00:00:06,109
HI, I'M ALEX, AND I'M GONNA BE

3
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:08,008
A SENIOR IN HIGH SCHOOL.

4
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:09,561
I LIVE IN NEFFS, PENNSYLVANIA,

5
00:00:09,561 --> 00:00:11,183
WITH MY MOM, MY LITTLE BROTHER

6
00:00:11,183 --> 00:00:13,013
AND SISTER, OUR THREE DOGS,

7
00:00:13,013 --> 00:00:15,084
AND OUR RABBIT.

8
00:00:15,084 --> 00:00:16,430
MY PARENTS GOT DIVORCED

9
00:00:16,430 --> 00:00:17,396
WHEN I WAS YOUNG,

10
00:00:17,396 --> 00:00:18,535
AND MY DAD MOVED AWAY,

11
00:00:18,535 --> 00:00:20,158
SO MY MOM PRETTY MUCH RAISED US

12
00:00:20,158 --> 00:00:22,022
ON HER OWN.

13
00:00:22,022 --> 00:00:23,920
SHE ALWAYS TOLD ME THAT I NEED

14
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,990
TO BE RESPONSIBLE

15
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,095
AND INDEPENDENT.

16
00:00:26,095 --> 00:00:27,613
>> I'VE TOLD YOU THAT FOR MANY,

17
00:00:27,613 --> 00:00:29,029
MANY, MANY YEARS.

18
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,030
>> YEAH.

19
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,273
THAT'S WHY I HAVE TWO JOBS:

20
00:00:32,273 --> 00:00:33,861
ONE AT A FAST-FOOD RESTAURANT

21
00:00:33,861 --> 00:00:36,277
AND ANOTHER TEACHING KIDS DANCE.

22
00:00:36,277 --> 00:00:37,485
ALL RIGHT, THOSE SHOULDERS NEED

23
00:00:37,485 --> 00:00:38,728
TO BE HUGE.

24
00:00:38,728 --> 00:00:41,075
I LOVE DANCE, AND I HOPE TO OPEN

25
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:43,319
MY OWN STUDIO SOMEDAY.

26
00:00:43,319 --> 00:00:43,974
>> WHAT?

27
00:00:43,974 --> 00:00:45,252
>> WHEN I'M NOT WORKING,

28
00:00:45,252 --> 00:00:46,115
I'M HANGING OUT WITH MY

29
00:00:46,115 --> 00:00:48,013
BOYFRIEND, MATT.

30
00:00:48,013 --> 00:00:49,256
I FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM

31
00:00:49,256 --> 00:00:50,912
TWO YEARS AGO, WHEN WE WERE

32
00:00:50,912 --> 00:00:51,982
BOTH SOPHOMORES,

33
00:00:51,982 --> 00:00:54,157
BECAUSE HE WAS SO SMART, SWEET,

34
00:00:54,157 --> 00:00:55,952
FUNNY, AND DIFFERENT FROM

35
00:00:55,952 --> 00:00:58,299
OTHER GUYS, IN A GOOD WAY.

36
00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:00,267
BUT HE'S NEVER BEEN SUPER

37
00:01:00,267 --> 00:01:01,751
RESPONSIBLE.

38
00:01:01,751 --> 00:01:03,339
AND WHILE I'M FOCUSED ON GETTING

39
00:01:03,339 --> 00:01:04,374
THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL,

40
00:01:04,374 --> 00:01:06,169
MATT HAS ALWAYS BEEN IN AND OUT

41
00:01:06,169 --> 00:01:07,895
OF TROUBLE.

42
00:01:07,895 --> 00:01:09,207
MY FRIENDS DON'T GET WHY I'M

43
00:01:09,207 --> 00:01:10,173
WITH HIM.

44
00:01:10,173 --> 00:01:11,312
HE'S SMART, BUT--

45
00:01:11,312 --> 00:01:12,486
>> HE'S AN IDIOT.

46
00:01:12,486 --> 00:01:14,729
>> BUT MATT'S MY FIRST LOVE,

47
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:15,834
AND I'M HOPING HE'LL CLEAN UP

48
00:01:15,834 --> 00:01:17,180
HIS ACT FOR GOOD,

49
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:19,872
HIS ACT FOR GOOD,
BECAUSE I'M PREGNANT.

50
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:26,741
BECAUSE I'M PREGNANT.

51
00:01:26,741 --> 00:01:29,054
SO FAR, NOTHING HAS BEEN EASY

52
00:01:29,054 --> 00:01:30,607
ABOUT MY PREGNANCY.

53
00:01:30,607 --> 00:01:32,437
THERE'S A LOT TO PLAN FOR,

54
00:01:32,437 --> 00:01:34,266
BUT ALL I WANT TO DO IS PUT

55
00:01:34,266 --> 00:01:35,164
THINGS OFF.

56
00:01:35,164 --> 00:01:36,268
>> WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO SIT DOWN

57
00:01:36,268 --> 00:01:37,097
AND TALK ABOUT IT.

58
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:37,821
YOU KNOW THAT.

59
00:01:37,821 --> 00:01:38,857
I MEAN, I DID EVERYTHING THAT

60
00:01:38,857 --> 00:01:39,789
I POSSIBLY COULD TO PREVENT

61
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:41,170
THIS SITUATION.

62
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,171
NOW HERE WE ARE.

63
00:01:42,171 --> 00:01:44,242
DO YOU HAVE A PLAN OF ACTION?

64
00:01:44,242 --> 00:01:46,968
JUST AS FAR AS HAVING A CHILD?

65
00:01:46,968 --> 00:01:48,867
HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT ANYTHING?

66
00:01:48,867 --> 00:01:51,387
>> I'M STILL FIGURING IT OUT.

67
00:01:51,387 --> 00:01:52,491
>> WELL, YOU NEED TO MAKE

68
00:01:52,491 --> 00:01:53,630
SOME DECISIONS.

69
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,424
>> I KNOW.

70
00:01:54,424 --> 00:01:55,460
>> AND WHATEVER DECISIONS YOU

71
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,117
MAKE, YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH

72
00:01:57,117 --> 00:01:58,463
THE CONSEQUENCES.

73
00:01:58,463 --> 00:02:03,019
EVERYTHING HAS CONSEQUENCES.

74
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:05,055
>> THIS SITUATION IS MY MOM'S

75
00:02:05,055 --> 00:02:06,988
WORST NIGHTMARE.

76
00:02:06,988 --> 00:02:08,645
WHEN I STARTED HAVING SEX,

77
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:09,957
SHE TOOK ME TO THE DOCTOR

78
00:02:09,957 --> 00:02:11,372
TO GET BIRTH CONTROL.

79
00:02:11,372 --> 00:02:12,649
SO WHEN SHE FOUND OUT

80
00:02:12,649 --> 00:02:13,650
THAT I WAS PREGNANT,

81
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:15,307
SHE WAS FURIOUS.

82
00:02:15,307 --> 00:02:16,515
SHE SAID THAT I COULD EITHER PUT

83
00:02:16,515 --> 00:02:17,896
THE BABY UP FOR ADOPTION,

84
00:02:17,896 --> 00:02:19,415
OR I COULD KEEP THE BABY

85
00:02:19,415 --> 00:02:21,831
AND FIND ANOTHER PLACE TO LIVE.

86
00:02:21,831 --> 00:02:23,212
SINCE I FOUND OUT I'M HAVING

87
00:02:23,212 --> 00:02:24,592
A GIRL, AND SHE'S DUE IN LESS

88
00:02:24,592 --> 00:02:26,146
THAN A MONTH, IT'S BEEN REALLY

89
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:28,631
HARD TO MAKE A DECISION.

90
00:02:28,631 --> 00:02:30,046
AND I KNOW MATT'S BEEN

91
00:02:30,046 --> 00:02:31,668
STRUGGLING WITH IT AS WELL.

92
00:02:31,668 --> 00:02:33,498
I'VE NEVER BEEN

93
00:02:33,498 --> 00:02:35,776
IN A RELATIONSHIP THIS LONG.

94
00:02:35,776 --> 00:02:36,708
>> IT'S LIKE, IT FEELS LIKE

95
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:37,605
TWO YEARS KIND OF FLEW BY

96
00:02:37,605 --> 00:02:39,745
PRETTY FAST, LIKE, EVEN THIS

97
00:02:39,745 --> 00:02:40,953
WHOLE NINE MONTHS KIND OF WENT

98
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:41,851
BY PRETTY FAST.

99
00:02:41,851 --> 00:02:43,922
LIKE, I THINK ABOUT IT, LIKE,

100
00:02:43,922 --> 00:02:45,958
BACK IN NINTH GRADE WHEN WE

101
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,891
FIRST MET AND STUFF, LIKE,

102
00:02:47,891 --> 00:02:49,169
IN SCHOOL AND EVERYTHING, LIKE,

103
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,723
YOU NEVER REALLY WOULD ENVISION

104
00:02:51,723 --> 00:02:53,034
THIS KIND OF THING.

105
00:02:53,034 --> 00:02:54,277
>> BEFORE IT WAS MATH CLASS,

106
00:02:54,277 --> 00:02:55,520
AND THEN IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE,

107
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,039
NOW IT'S, LIKE, THERE'S A BABY.

108
00:02:58,039 --> 00:02:58,971
>> WELL, WE DID MOVE

109
00:02:58,971 --> 00:02:59,696
PRETTY FAST.

110
00:02:59,696 --> 00:03:00,766
YOU WERE PRETTY MUCH AT MY

111
00:03:00,766 --> 00:03:01,733
HOUSE, LIKE, EVERY WEEKEND,

112
00:03:01,733 --> 00:03:03,183
AND THEN WE'RE HERE.

113
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:05,254
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

114
00:03:05,254 --> 00:03:06,255
>> YOU JUST WANT TO STOP HERE?

115
00:03:06,255 --> 00:03:07,325
>> YEAH.

116
00:03:07,325 --> 00:03:08,360
>> IT'S HOT.

117
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,537
>> I GOT TO SIT.

118
00:03:12,537 --> 00:03:13,814
I LOVE YOU MORE THAN ANYTHING.

119
00:03:13,814 --> 00:03:15,264
YOU'VE BECOME, LIKE,

120
00:03:15,264 --> 00:03:16,437
MY BEST FRIEND.

121
00:03:16,437 --> 00:03:17,749
>> I LOVE YOU, AND I CARE

122
00:03:17,749 --> 00:03:19,544
ABOUT YOU; IT'S JUST, AT THIS

123
00:03:19,544 --> 00:03:20,683
POINT IN TIME, LIKE, WE HAVE TO

124
00:03:20,683 --> 00:03:21,649
WORRY ABOUT OTHER THINGS.

125
00:03:21,649 --> 00:03:22,892
LIKE, I WANT WHAT'S BEST

126
00:03:22,892 --> 00:03:24,480
FOR HER, AND SOMETIMES I THINK,

127
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,103
LIKE, YOU KNOW, MAYBE YOUR MOM'S

128
00:03:27,103 --> 00:03:28,656
RIGHT WITH ADOPTION,

129
00:03:28,656 --> 00:03:30,451
BECAUSE IT'D PROVIDE HER WITH

130
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:31,694
EVERYTHING SHE REALLY DOES NEED,

131
00:03:31,694 --> 00:03:32,488
YOU KNOW.

132
00:03:32,488 --> 00:03:34,352
ON THE SAME TOKEN, I HONESTLY

133
00:03:34,352 --> 00:03:35,525
DON'T WANT TO MISS ANYTHING,

134
00:03:35,525 --> 00:03:37,009
IN, LIKE, A SELFISH KIND OF WAY,

135
00:03:37,009 --> 00:03:38,632
LIKE, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

136
00:03:38,632 --> 00:03:40,150
HOW DO YOU FEEL LIKE?

137
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:42,463
>> I DON'T THINK THAT I CAN GIVE

138
00:03:42,463 --> 00:03:44,431
HER UP, BUT THE THING THAT I'M

139
00:03:44,431 --> 00:03:46,398
WORRIED AND SCARED OF THE MOST

140
00:03:46,398 --> 00:03:48,952
IS DOING IT ON MY OWN.

141
00:03:48,952 --> 00:03:50,333
>> I'M REALLY GONNA TRY MY BEST

142
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,749
TO BE THERE AS MUCH AS I CAN

143
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:54,234
POSSIBLY, LIKE, HELP.

144
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,443
>> YEAH.

145
00:03:56,443 --> 00:03:57,720
IT'S JUST TOUGH, BECAUSE I'M SO

146
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,342
SCARED ABOUT EVERYTHING.

147
00:03:59,342 --> 00:04:00,240
>> WE'LL SEE,

148
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,068
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

149
00:04:01,068 --> 00:04:03,622
LIKE, WITH TIME, IT'LL--

150
00:04:03,622 --> 00:04:07,695
WE'LL SEE HOW IT GOES, YOU KNOW?

151
00:04:07,695 --> 00:04:08,627
>> I WISH MATT SOUNDED MORE

152
00:04:08,627 --> 00:04:11,181
CONFIDENT ABOUT BEING A DAD.

153
00:04:11,181 --> 00:04:12,390
HE HASN'T BEEN VERY RELIABLE

154
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:13,322
IN THE PAST.

155
00:04:13,322 --> 00:04:14,702
HE DISAPPEARS A LOT,

156
00:04:14,702 --> 00:04:16,359
HE PARTIES WAY TOO MUCH,

157
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:18,465
AND HE'S BEEN ON PROBATION.

158
00:04:18,465 --> 00:04:19,707
BUT HE NEEDS TO PULL IT

159
00:04:19,707 --> 00:04:21,226
TOGETHER, 'CAUSE IF I KEEP

160
00:04:21,226 --> 00:04:23,504
THE BABY, I'M GOING TO NEED

161
00:04:23,504 --> 00:04:25,851
HIM THERE.

162
00:04:25,851 --> 00:04:26,956
IT'S THE SUMMER BEFORE

163
00:04:26,956 --> 00:04:28,302
SENIOR YEAR, AND I THOUGHT

164
00:04:28,302 --> 00:04:29,510
I'D BE SPENDING ALL MY TIME

165
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:30,684
AT THE STUDIO.

166
00:04:30,684 --> 00:04:32,755
BUT AT 8 1/2 MONTHS PREGNANT,

167
00:04:32,755 --> 00:04:34,135
IT'S BECOME A LOT HARDER

168
00:04:34,135 --> 00:04:35,067
TO DANCE.

169
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,206
>> READY?

170
00:04:36,206 --> 00:04:38,657
FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, AND--

171
00:04:38,657 --> 00:04:43,283
ONE AND A TWO AND AN UP, BACK.

172
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,871
AND ONE AND TWO AND THREE, FOUR,

173
00:04:45,871 --> 00:04:48,218
FIVE, SIX, SEVEN, AND EIGHT.

174
00:04:48,218 --> 00:04:50,290
OKAY.

175
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,188
>> [grunts]

176
00:04:52,188 --> 00:04:54,294
>> YOU LOOK TIRED.

177
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:57,780
>> I'M SO OUT OF IT.

178
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,575
>> OH, MY GOD, SHE'S RIDICULOUS.

179
00:04:59,575 --> 00:05:01,335
I HAVEN'T BEEN SLEEPING AT ALL.

180
00:05:01,335 --> 00:05:02,854
I ROLL CONSTANTLY

181
00:05:02,854 --> 00:05:04,338
BACK AND FORTH.

182
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:05,305
>> HOW DID YOU FEEL WHEN YOU

183
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,098
FIRST FOUND OUT?

184
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:07,479
>> I WAS SCARED OUT OF MY

185
00:05:07,479 --> 00:05:09,343
FREAKING MIND.

186
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:10,482
I CRIED ALL THE WAY

187
00:05:10,482 --> 00:05:11,483
TO THE BUS STOP.

188
00:05:11,483 --> 00:05:12,760
I CRIED ALL THE WAY TO SCHOOL.

189
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:15,038
AND THEN I DID HAVE A LOT OF,

190
00:05:15,038 --> 00:05:16,695
LIKE, REGRET WHEN I FOUND OUT.

191
00:05:16,695 --> 00:05:18,041
>> DO PEOPLE, LIKE, STARE AT YOU

192
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:18,904
IN SCHOOL?

193
00:05:18,904 --> 00:05:20,630
>> OH, MY GOSH, YEAH.

194
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,183
>> I CAN IMAGINE, LIKE--

195
00:05:22,183 --> 00:05:22,908
>> YEAH.

196
00:05:22,908 --> 00:05:23,875
>> DO PEOPLE, LIKE, CALL YOU

197
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:24,979
NAMES AND STUFF, NOW THAT YOU

198
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:25,670
GOT PREGNANT?

199
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:27,672
>> YEAH, I'VE GOTTEN SLUT,

200
00:05:27,672 --> 00:05:29,259
WHORE.

201
00:05:29,259 --> 00:05:30,468
>> THAT'S A SHAME.

202
00:05:30,468 --> 00:05:31,572
>> THAT'S HORRIBLE.

203
00:05:31,572 --> 00:05:33,160
>> I MEAN, MATT AND I WERE USING

204
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,230
PROTECTION, AND I WAS ON

205
00:05:34,230 --> 00:05:35,576
BIRTH CONTROL, AND IT JUST KIND

206
00:05:35,576 --> 00:05:36,612
OF WAS LIKE AN "OOPSIE"

207
00:05:36,612 --> 00:05:37,475
KIND OF THING.

208
00:05:37,475 --> 00:05:39,062
HIM AND I WERE LIKE, "OH, SHOULD

209
00:05:39,062 --> 00:05:40,340
WE GO GET PLAN "B"?

210
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,202
WHAT SHOULD WE DO?"

211
00:05:41,202 --> 00:05:42,272
AND THEN I WENT THERE.

212
00:05:42,272 --> 00:05:43,653
IT'S FREAKING $50.

213
00:05:43,653 --> 00:05:44,482
>> all: YEAH.

214
00:05:44,482 --> 00:05:45,586
>> I'M LIKE, OKAY.

215
00:05:45,586 --> 00:05:46,725
>> WOULD YOU GIVE THE BABY UP

216
00:05:46,725 --> 00:05:47,554
FOR ADOPTION?

217
00:05:47,554 --> 00:05:50,073
WOULD YOU WANT--WOULD YOU FEEL

218
00:05:50,073 --> 00:05:50,936
LIKE YOU COULD BE MORE

219
00:05:50,936 --> 00:05:52,628
OF A TEENAGER?

220
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:53,939
>> I'M STILL IN BETWEEN.

221
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:56,321
IT IS REALLY HARD, YOU KNOW?

222
00:05:56,321 --> 00:05:57,633
I'M MORE TOWARDS KEEPING THE

223
00:05:57,633 --> 00:05:59,807
BABY, BUT IT'S LIKE I'M STARTING

224
00:05:59,807 --> 00:06:01,947
TO LOOK AT IT AS, "WHAT'S GOING

225
00:06:01,947 --> 00:06:02,948
TO BE BETTER FOR HER,

226
00:06:02,948 --> 00:06:04,122
SOMEONE WHO CAN GIVE HER

227
00:06:04,122 --> 00:06:07,367
EVERYTHING PLUS THAT, OR SOMEONE

228
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:08,229
WHO'S GOING TO STRUGGLE

229
00:06:08,229 --> 00:06:12,026
TO GIVE HER EVERYTHING?"

230
00:06:12,026 --> 00:06:12,993
I'M IN A REALLY TRICKY

231
00:06:12,993 --> 00:06:14,822
SITUATION, AND IT ISN'T GETTING

232
00:06:14,822 --> 00:06:17,204
ANY EASIER, SINCE EVERYONE IN MY

233
00:06:17,204 --> 00:06:18,654
FAMILY IS WONDERING WHAT I'M

234
00:06:18,654 --> 00:06:20,828
GOING TO DO.

235
00:06:20,828 --> 00:06:23,141
>> SO WHAT REALLY DOES IT FEEL

236
00:06:23,141 --> 00:06:23,831
LIKE, THOUGH?

237
00:06:23,831 --> 00:06:24,867
>> LIKE BEING PUNCHED ON THE

238
00:06:24,867 --> 00:06:26,938
INSIDE OF YOUR STOMACH.

239
00:06:26,938 --> 00:06:28,526
>> ARE YOU READY?

240
00:06:28,526 --> 00:06:29,803
>> NO.

241
00:06:29,803 --> 00:06:32,461
>> ARE YOU ALLOWED TO KEEP IT?

242
00:06:32,461 --> 00:06:34,083
IS IT, LIKE, AGAINST THE LAW FOR

243
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,325
YOU TO KEEP IT?

244
00:06:35,325 --> 00:06:36,741
>> NO, IT'S NOT AGAINST THE LAW

245
00:06:36,741 --> 00:06:39,260
FOR ME TO KEEP IT.

246
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,124
>> DO YOU WANT TO KEEP IT?

247
00:06:41,124 --> 00:06:42,160
>> I WANT TO KEEP IT.

248
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,437
THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

249
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:44,990
BUT DO YOU THINK THAT IT'S THE

250
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,785
BEST THING FOR ME TO?

251
00:06:46,785 --> 00:06:48,304
>> YOU CAN BE HONEST, HONEY.

252
00:06:48,304 --> 00:06:50,410
>> YOU'RE STILL IN SCHOOL.

253
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:51,445
>> YEAH.

254
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:52,757
>> PEOPLE ARE GONNA PICK ON YOU

255
00:06:52,757 --> 00:06:54,275
AND WHATEVER.

256
00:06:54,275 --> 00:06:56,036
>> WELL, EVEN WITHOUT A BABY,

257
00:06:56,036 --> 00:06:57,175
PEOPLE PICK ON YOU.

258
00:06:57,175 --> 00:06:58,418
>> YEAH, BUT NOT AS MUCH WHEN

259
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,867
YOU'RE WITH A BABY.

260
00:06:59,867 --> 00:07:01,386
I THINK YOU SHOULD ADOPT IT,

261
00:07:01,386 --> 00:07:03,043
'CAUSE YOU'RE A LITTLE

262
00:07:03,043 --> 00:07:03,906
TOO YOUNG.

263
00:07:03,906 --> 00:07:07,703
>> IT'S HARD TO KEEP A BABY.

264
00:07:07,703 --> 00:07:09,705
>> IT'S JUST NOT THE RIGHT TIME.

265
00:07:09,705 --> 00:07:11,672
>> WITH MY BABY DUE IN JUST TWO

266
00:07:11,672 --> 00:07:13,467
WEEKS, I REALLY NEED TO COME

267
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:15,020
TO A DECISION, AND MY MOM IS

268
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,643
LOSING PATIENCE.

269
00:07:16,643 --> 00:07:17,644
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DO WITH

270
00:07:17,644 --> 00:07:18,610
YOUR LIFE?

271
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,198
>> OWN THE DANCE STUDIO.

272
00:07:20,198 --> 00:07:21,441
>> DO YOU THINK YOU CAN DO THIS

273
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:22,856
WITHOUT FINISHING SCHOOL?

274
00:07:22,856 --> 00:07:23,822
>> NO.

275
00:07:23,822 --> 00:07:24,823
>> NOW, DO YOU THINK THAT YOU

276
00:07:24,823 --> 00:07:26,169
CAN FINISH SCHOOL AND GO TO

277
00:07:26,169 --> 00:07:28,931
COLLEGE WITH AN INFANT?

278
00:07:28,931 --> 00:07:30,657
AND HOW DOES THAT MAKE YOU FEEL?

279
00:07:30,657 --> 00:07:33,314
>> LIKE COMPLETE [bleep].

280
00:07:33,314 --> 00:07:34,350
>> THERE WILL BE NO BABIES IN

281
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:35,731
THIS HOUSE, AND I TOLD YOU THAT.

282
00:07:35,731 --> 00:07:36,870
THAT WAS ACTUALLY ONE FORM

283
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:37,733
OF BIRTH CONTROL.

284
00:07:37,733 --> 00:07:39,459
>> I KNOW.

285
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:41,461
>> I'M NOT GONNA RAISE A CHILD,

286
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,324
SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

287
00:07:43,324 --> 00:07:44,809
>> IF I KEPT HER, I'D HAVE TO GO

288
00:07:44,809 --> 00:07:46,224
LOOK FOR SOMEWHERE ELSE.

289
00:07:46,224 --> 00:07:47,777
>> DO YOU THINK MATT WOULD GIVE

290
00:07:47,777 --> 00:07:49,434
YOU ANY MONEY TO HELP RAISE

291
00:07:49,434 --> 00:07:50,331
THIS CHILD?

292
00:07:50,331 --> 00:07:52,126
>> HIS MIND IS SOMEWHERE ELSE,

293
00:07:52,126 --> 00:07:54,232
AND IT ALWAYS IS.

294
00:07:54,232 --> 00:07:55,992
>> HONEY, HE'S A KID.

295
00:07:55,992 --> 00:07:58,339
THAT'S WHY KIDS SHOULDN'T TRY

296
00:07:58,339 --> 00:07:59,513
TO BE PARENTS.

297
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:01,032
>> I KNOW WHAT'S BEST.

298
00:08:01,032 --> 00:08:02,930
>> AND WHAT IS THAT?

299
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:05,346
>> ADOPTION.

300
00:08:05,346 --> 00:08:06,831
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT

301
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:08,073
ADOPTION?

302
00:08:08,073 --> 00:08:10,455
>> I THINK IT'S A GOOD OPTION.

303
00:08:10,455 --> 00:08:13,009
I REALLY DO.

304
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:15,874
IT JUST--

305
00:08:15,874 --> 00:08:18,290
MY HEART JUST SAYS NO.

306
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:19,809
>> THERE ARE A LOT OF FAMILIES

307
00:08:19,809 --> 00:08:20,741
OUT THERE THAT WOULD HAVE

308
00:08:20,741 --> 00:08:23,882
UNLIMITED VISITATION.

309
00:08:23,882 --> 00:08:25,263
>> THAT'S THE THING, THOUGH,

310
00:08:25,263 --> 00:08:27,437
LIKE, IT'S NOT AS MUCH

311
00:08:27,437 --> 00:08:29,198
AS I WANT.

312
00:08:29,198 --> 00:08:32,270
AS I WANT.
[crying]

313
00:08:32,270 --> 00:08:38,069
[crying]

314
00:08:38,069 --> 00:08:39,519
>> YOU'RE 17.

315
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,694
>> I KNOW.

316
00:08:42,694 --> 00:08:45,594
>> YOU NEED TO BE A KID.

317
00:08:45,594 --> 00:08:46,491
>> I KNOW WHAT I WANT,

318
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:51,461
AND I KNOW WHAT'S BEST.

319
00:08:51,461 --> 00:08:53,360
AND I WISH I COULD HAVE WHAT I

320
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,294
WANT, BUT I KNOW THAT I CAN'T.

321
00:08:56,294 --> 00:08:59,124
>> SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

322
00:08:59,124 --> 00:09:00,919
>> I REALLY JUST--I DON'T HAVE

323
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,956
>> I REALLY JUST--I DON'T HAVE
AN ANSWER.

324
00:09:02,956 --> 00:09:16,728
AN ANSWER.

325
00:09:16,728 --> 00:09:17,798
>> TALKING TO MY MOM ABOUT THE

326
00:09:17,798 --> 00:09:20,076
BABY WAS REALLY PAINFUL.

327
00:09:20,076 --> 00:09:21,595
I KNOW ADOPTION IS THE LOGICAL

328
00:09:21,595 --> 00:09:23,390
CHOICE FOR ME, BUT RIGHT NOW,

329
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,564
ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT

330
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,048
IS BEING A MOM.

331
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:27,739
>> both: OHH!

332
00:09:27,739 --> 00:09:29,051
>> OH, HERE'S NEWBORN.

333
00:09:29,051 --> 00:09:29,948
>> [gasps]

334
00:09:29,948 --> 00:09:31,191
PULL THAT DOWN.

335
00:09:31,191 --> 00:09:32,468
[gasps]

336
00:09:32,468 --> 00:09:34,643
OH, MY GOD.

337
00:09:34,643 --> 00:09:37,577
HOW MUCH IS IT?

338
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,371
>> $27.

339
00:09:39,371 --> 00:09:41,304
>> OH.

340
00:09:41,304 --> 00:09:42,512
>> HOW MUCH PER HOUR DO YOU GET?

341
00:09:42,512 --> 00:09:44,273
>> I GET 7 BUCKS AN HOUR.

342
00:09:44,273 --> 00:09:45,930
>> THAT'D BE FOUR HOURS

343
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:47,069
FOR THAT.

344
00:09:47,069 --> 00:09:47,897
>> JUST TO GET--

345
00:09:47,897 --> 00:09:48,864
>> AN OUTFIT.

346
00:09:48,864 --> 00:09:50,762
AND THAT'S BEFORE TAXES.

347
00:09:50,762 --> 00:09:52,005
GIRAFFE.

348
00:09:52,005 --> 00:09:53,351
>> $29.

349
00:09:53,351 --> 00:09:54,076
>> DID YOUR MOM

350
00:09:54,076 --> 00:09:55,042
GET YOU ANYTHING?

351
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:56,078
>> NO.

352
00:09:56,078 --> 00:09:57,424
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE

353
00:09:57,424 --> 00:09:59,115
FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR HER,

354
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:01,186
SO HOPEFULLY MATT WILL BE

355
00:10:01,186 --> 00:10:03,568
HELPING OUT AND STUFF.

356
00:10:03,568 --> 00:10:05,156
KEEPING THE BABY WILL BE REALLY

357
00:10:05,156 --> 00:10:07,986
EXPENSIVE, ESPECIALLY IF MY MOM

358
00:10:07,986 --> 00:10:09,367
KICKS ME OUT OF THE HOUSE.

359
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:11,576
SO EVEN THOUGH I'M ALMOST

360
00:10:11,576 --> 00:10:13,026
NINE MONTHS PREGNANT, I WALK

361
00:10:13,026 --> 00:10:14,683
A MILE TO MY JOB, JUST TO EARN

362
00:10:14,683 --> 00:10:16,823
A MINIMUM-WAGE PAYCHECK.

363
00:10:16,823 --> 00:10:18,548
BUT I'M NOT SURE IF THAT WILL BE

364
00:10:18,548 --> 00:10:20,033
ENOUGH TO SUPPORT A BABY,

365
00:10:20,033 --> 00:10:21,275
SO I NEED TO TALK TO MATT

366
00:10:21,275 --> 00:10:22,794
ABOUT ALL THIS.

367
00:10:22,794 --> 00:10:24,485
BUT HE'S BEEN REALLY FLAKY

368
00:10:24,485 --> 00:10:25,763
LATELY.

369
00:10:25,763 --> 00:10:26,798
>> WAS THERE FOUR OF US?

370
00:10:26,798 --> 00:10:27,868
OH, YEAH, THERE IS.

371
00:10:27,868 --> 00:10:30,457
>> YEAH, 'CAUSE MATT'S NOT HERE,

372
00:10:30,457 --> 00:10:31,561
LIKE USUAL.

373
00:10:31,561 --> 00:10:32,528
>> DID YOU CALL HIM AGAIN?

374
00:10:32,528 --> 00:10:33,736
>> WELL, HE WAS LIKE,

375
00:10:33,736 --> 00:10:34,737
"OKAY, I'M GOING TO BE HERE IN

376
00:10:34,737 --> 00:10:35,496
TEN MINUTES."

377
00:10:35,496 --> 00:10:36,325
BUT IT'S BEEN, LIKE--

378
00:10:36,325 --> 00:10:37,222
>> 45.

379
00:10:37,222 --> 00:10:38,223
>> YEAH.

380
00:10:38,223 --> 00:10:39,155
>> HE PROBABLY DOESN'T EVEN

381
00:10:39,155 --> 00:10:39,915
KNOW WHERE IT IS.

382
00:10:39,915 --> 00:10:41,295
>> NO, HE KNOWS WHERE IT IS.

383
00:10:41,295 --> 00:10:42,711
HE'S BEEN, UH, KICKED OUT

384
00:10:42,711 --> 00:10:44,367
OF HERE BEFORE.

385
00:10:44,367 --> 00:10:45,714
>> OH.

386
00:10:45,714 --> 00:10:48,786
>> CLASSY.

387
00:10:48,786 --> 00:10:49,890
>> IT'S SO HARD TO SWING

388
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:53,204
OVER MY BELLY.

389
00:10:53,204 --> 00:10:54,481
>> OHH!

390
00:10:54,481 --> 00:10:57,898
>> all: OHH!

391
00:10:57,898 --> 00:11:00,004
>> IS THAT YOUR PHONE GOING OFF?

392
00:11:00,004 --> 00:11:00,936
>> MATT.

393
00:11:00,936 --> 00:11:02,385
>> HELLO, YEAH?

394
00:11:02,385 --> 00:11:04,456
>> HELLO, YEAH?
>> WHERE ARE YOU?

395
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:06,666
>> WHERE ARE YOU?

396
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,012
>> WELL, CAN YOU PLEASE HURRY,

397
00:11:08,012 --> 00:11:09,013
'CAUSE I WOULD LIKE TO SPEND

398
00:11:09,013 --> 00:11:11,809
AT LEAST SOME TIME TOGETHER.

399
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:12,948
>> BYE.

400
00:11:12,948 --> 00:11:14,018
>> WHERE IS HE?

401
00:11:14,018 --> 00:11:14,777
>> I DON'T KNOW.

402
00:11:14,777 --> 00:11:16,158
HE TOLD ME HE'S ON HIS WAY.

403
00:11:16,158 --> 00:11:17,469
>> YOU WANT TO SEE HIS DAUGHTER

404
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:18,712
BE BORN, BUT, LIKE, IS HE EVEN

405
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:19,748
GOING TO SHOW UP?

406
00:11:19,748 --> 00:11:21,128
>> I HAVE A FUNNY FEELING HE'S

407
00:11:21,128 --> 00:11:22,578
JUST GOING TO, LIKE, DISAPPEAR

408
00:11:22,578 --> 00:11:23,959
RIGHT WHEN YOU NEED HIM.

409
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:25,685
>> MAYBE HE'LL GROW A PAIR

410
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:29,136
AND MAN UP FOR ME.

411
00:11:29,136 --> 00:11:30,206
>> HE OBVIOUSLY HAS A PAIR.

412
00:11:30,206 --> 00:11:31,138
LOOK WHAT HAPPENED.

413
00:11:31,138 --> 00:11:35,177
[laughter]

414
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:35,971
>> UGH.

415
00:11:35,971 --> 00:11:37,558
MATT NEVER SHOWED UP.

416
00:11:37,558 --> 00:11:38,870
NOW THAT MY DUE DATE

417
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,803
IS SO CLOSE, I REALLY NEED

418
00:11:40,803 --> 00:11:45,394
HIS SUPPORT.

419
00:11:45,394 --> 00:11:47,154
>> PLEASE LEAVE YOUR MESSAGE.

420
00:11:47,154 --> 00:11:49,467
>> MATT, TOMORROW WE HAVE

421
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:51,780
AN ULTRASOUND AT 4:00.

422
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,160
LIKE, YOU REALLY

423
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:53,954
DON'T UNDERSTAND.

424
00:11:53,954 --> 00:11:54,886
WE NEED TO HAVE A SERIOUS

425
00:11:54,886 --> 00:11:59,339
CONVERSATION.

426
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:01,375
CONVERSATION.
OH, MY GOD.

427
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:07,865
OH, MY GOD.

428
00:12:07,865 --> 00:12:08,935
MATT DID TURN UP

429
00:12:08,935 --> 00:12:09,832
TO MY APPOINTMENT,

430
00:12:09,832 --> 00:12:11,282
BUT IT LOOKED LIKE HE'D BEEN OUT

431
00:12:11,282 --> 00:12:13,387
BUT IT LOOKED LIKE HE'D BEEN OUT
PARTYING ALL NIGHT.

432
00:12:13,387 --> 00:12:17,322
PARTYING ALL NIGHT.

433
00:12:17,322 --> 00:12:19,877
>> THERE'S HER HEART.

434
00:12:19,877 --> 00:12:21,257
>> I'M HAPPY YOU CAME.

435
00:12:21,257 --> 00:12:23,535
>> MM-HMM.

436
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:24,744
>> ARE YOU GETTING EXCITED,

437
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:25,952
MATT?

438
00:12:25,952 --> 00:12:28,437
>> SURE.

439
00:12:28,437 --> 00:12:32,406
>> [sighs]

440
00:12:32,406 --> 00:12:34,650
I REALLY LIKE ARABELLA.

441
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:36,721
I REALLY LIKE ARABELLA.
>> MM-HMM.

442
00:12:36,721 --> 00:12:40,760
>> MM-HMM.

443
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,486
>> OH, SHE IS TOTALLY FACING

444
00:12:43,486 --> 00:12:45,454
YOUR SPINE, NOT SHOWING US

445
00:12:45,454 --> 00:12:47,283
HER FACE.

446
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:50,010
>> SHE'S STUBBORN.

447
00:12:50,010 --> 00:12:51,011
>> WHO'S THAT TAKE AFTER,

448
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:53,117
YOU OR DAD?

449
00:12:53,117 --> 00:12:54,187
>> DEFINITELY HIM.

450
00:12:54,187 --> 00:12:54,981
>> DEFINITELY DAD?

451
00:12:54,981 --> 00:12:57,362
[laughs]

452
00:12:57,362 --> 00:12:59,157
>> HOW SOON DO YOU THINK?

453
00:12:59,157 --> 00:13:00,469
>> SHE IS DEFINITELY IN POSITION

454
00:13:00,469 --> 00:13:02,954
AND READY TO GO.

455
00:13:02,954 --> 00:13:04,611
>> ALL RIGHT.

456
00:13:04,611 --> 00:13:06,302
IF WE DO PARENT, I'M LEANING

457
00:13:06,302 --> 00:13:08,408
TOWARDS NAMING HER ARABELLA.

458
00:13:08,408 --> 00:13:10,341
WITH MATT BEING SO OUT OF IT,

459
00:13:10,341 --> 00:13:12,446
I CAN'T EVEN TALK TO HIM TO HELP

460
00:13:12,446 --> 00:13:16,036
ME MAKE A DECISION.

461
00:13:16,036 --> 00:13:17,072
>> HOW'S YOUR SUMMER BEEN

462
00:13:17,072 --> 00:13:17,831
SO FAR?

463
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:18,798
>> IT'S BEEN PRETTY GOOD.

464
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:19,695
HOW'S YOURS?

465
00:13:19,695 --> 00:13:24,631
>> UGH, LONG.

466
00:13:24,631 --> 00:13:25,805
YOU LOOK LIKE YOU'RE READY

467
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:26,633
TO POP NOW.

468
00:13:26,633 --> 00:13:28,048
COME OUT, BABY.

469
00:13:28,048 --> 00:13:29,118
>> NO, WE DON'T WANT HER TO COME

470
00:13:29,118 --> 00:13:29,809
OUT JUST YET.

471
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:30,810
WE WANT HER TO STAY IN HERE

472
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:31,569
FOREVER.

473
00:13:31,569 --> 00:13:32,225
>> FOREVER?

474
00:13:32,225 --> 00:13:33,226
>> FOREVER AND EVER AND EVER.

475
00:13:33,226 --> 00:13:34,227
>> YOU WANT TO HAVE A BIG BUTT

476
00:13:34,227 --> 00:13:34,814
FOREVER?

477
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:35,815
>> I COULD HAVE A BIG BUTT

478
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,505
FOREVER.

479
00:13:36,505 --> 00:13:37,333
I'LL LIVE WITH THAT.

480
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:38,472
>> [laughs]

481
00:13:38,472 --> 00:13:40,958
OKAY, BUT WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO

482
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,304
MAKE THE FINAL DECISION?

483
00:13:42,304 --> 00:13:43,615
>> I DON'T KNOW.

484
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:45,410
I REALLY DON'T WANT TO.

485
00:13:45,410 --> 00:13:47,067
>> WHAT DOES MATT THINK?

486
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:48,034
>> LIKE, I'VE BEEN TRYING TO

487
00:13:48,034 --> 00:13:49,863
TALK TO MATT AND JUST FIGURE OUT

488
00:13:49,863 --> 00:13:51,244
WHERE HIS HEAD IS.

489
00:13:51,244 --> 00:13:53,280
IT JUST SEEMS A LOT LIKE HE'S

490
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:55,317
STILL OBSESSED WITH SPENDING

491
00:13:55,317 --> 00:13:56,214
TIME WITH HIS FRIENDS.

492
00:13:56,214 --> 00:14:00,736
AND HE GOES M.I.A. ALL THE TIME.

493
00:14:00,736 --> 00:14:01,737
>> DO YOU REALLY FEEL YOU CAN

494
00:14:01,737 --> 00:14:03,808
TRUST HIM WHEN THE BABY'S BORN?

495
00:14:03,808 --> 00:14:05,603
>> WITH MATT BEING SO OUT OF IT,

496
00:14:05,603 --> 00:14:07,916
I CAN'T EVEN TALK TO HIM TO HELP

497
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:09,296
ME MAKE A DECISION.

498
00:14:09,296 --> 00:14:11,367
AND WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

499
00:14:11,367 --> 00:14:15,751
>> HEY, WHAT'S UP?

500
00:14:15,751 --> 00:14:16,890
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S

501
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,133
GOING TO BE OUR SENIOR YEAR.

502
00:14:18,133 --> 00:14:19,479
>> OH, MY GOSH, I KNOW.

503
00:14:19,479 --> 00:14:20,480
>> REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE BACK

504
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,171
IN, LIKE, ELEMENTARY SCHOOL,

505
00:14:22,171 --> 00:14:23,172
WHEN I FIRST MET YOU.

506
00:14:23,172 --> 00:14:25,278
>> OH, YES.

507
00:14:25,278 --> 00:14:26,417
ARE YOU EXCITED TO DO, LIKE,

508
00:14:26,417 --> 00:14:28,453
PROM AND SENIOR WEEK?

509
00:14:28,453 --> 00:14:29,489
>> YEAH.

510
00:14:29,489 --> 00:14:30,766
DO YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE GOING

511
00:14:30,766 --> 00:14:31,871
TO HAVE PROBLEMS NEXT YEAR WITH

512
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,872
THE BABY?

513
00:14:32,872 --> 00:14:34,390
>> I'M REALLY SCARED OF THAT,

514
00:14:34,390 --> 00:14:36,703
LIKE, TRYING TO DO THAT THE SAME

515
00:14:36,703 --> 00:14:37,807
TIME I'M TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF

516
00:14:37,807 --> 00:14:39,361
HER AND DO A JOB.

517
00:14:39,361 --> 00:14:40,086
>> MM-HMM.

518
00:14:40,086 --> 00:14:41,087
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GONNA

519
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:43,158
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GONNA
DO IT.

520
00:14:43,158 --> 00:14:48,888
DO IT.

521
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,890
>> WHAT IF YOU DID GIVE HER UP?

522
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,582
LIKE, YOU'D BE ABLE TO, LIKE,

523
00:14:53,582 --> 00:14:55,895
GO OUT WITH YOUR FRIENDS, JUST

524
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:57,586
LIVE YOUR HIGH SCHOOL YEARS.

525
00:14:57,586 --> 00:14:58,587
>> YEAH.

526
00:14:58,587 --> 00:14:59,622
>> LIKE, YOU'D BE ABLE TO DO THE

527
00:14:59,622 --> 00:15:01,003
THINGS THAT, LIKE, I'M DOING.

528
00:15:01,003 --> 00:15:02,349
>> YEAH.

529
00:15:02,349 --> 00:15:03,903
I HAVE STARTED TO CONSIDER

530
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,249
ADOPTION A LITTLE BIT.

531
00:15:05,249 --> 00:15:06,250
>> WELL, YOU KNOW, LIKE, MY

532
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,285
MOM'S THERE TO SUPPORT YOU.

533
00:15:07,285 --> 00:15:08,321
>> MM-HMM.

534
00:15:08,321 --> 00:15:10,081
>> AND, UM, YOU KNOW, LIKE,

535
00:15:10,081 --> 00:15:11,911
MY MOM CAN'T HAVE KIDS.

536
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:15,121
SO SHE ASKED ME IF, UM--

537
00:15:15,121 --> 00:15:16,570
IF YOU WOULD CONSIDER HER, LIKE,

538
00:15:16,570 --> 00:15:17,571
TAKING THE BABY

539
00:15:17,571 --> 00:15:20,022
AND ADOPTING THE BABY.

540
00:15:20,022 --> 00:15:22,162
>> REALLY?

541
00:15:22,162 --> 00:15:22,922
UM--

542
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:23,853
>> AND I KNOW THAT'S A BIG

543
00:15:23,853 --> 00:15:26,235
DECISION, BUT, LIKE, YOU'RE

544
00:15:26,235 --> 00:15:27,650

00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:29,135
YOU COULD, LIKE, COME SEE HER,

546
00:15:29,135 --> 00:15:31,758
WHATEVER.

IT'S JUST SOMETHING, LIKE,

548
00:15:32,828 --> 00:15:34,934
IT'S JUST SOMETHING, LIKE,
IF YOU WANT TO CONSIDER IT.

549
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:44,771
IF YOU WANT TO CONSIDER IT.

550
00:15:44,771 --> 00:15:45,703
>> I'VE BEEN THINKING A LOT

551
00:15:45,703 --> 00:15:47,084
ABOUT BRIANNA'S OFFER.

552
00:15:47,084 --> 00:15:48,706
I WANT TO TALK TO MATT

553
00:15:48,706 --> 00:15:50,501
ABOUT IT, BUT I STILL CAN'T GET

554
00:15:50,501 --> 00:15:55,506
AHOLD OF HIM.

555
00:15:55,506 --> 00:15:56,783
SO I'M GOING TO MEET WITH

556
00:15:56,783 --> 00:16:00,304
BRIANNA'S PARENTS ON MY OWN.

557
00:16:00,304 --> 00:16:02,271
>> UM, I HAD TOLD ALEX WHEN WE

558
00:16:02,271 --> 00:16:03,307
WERE OUT THAT YOU GUYS ARE

559
00:16:03,307 --> 00:16:04,342
LOOKING TO ADOPT.

560
00:16:04,342 --> 00:16:06,034
>> IT'S LIKE, I WANT TO LOOK AT

561
00:16:06,034 --> 00:16:07,104
ALL THE OPTIONS THAT I

562
00:16:07,104 --> 00:16:08,070
POSSIBLY HAVE.

563
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:11,039
>> SHE'S BEEN WANTING TO ADOPT.

564
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,454
PHYSICALLY, HER AND I CAN'T

565
00:16:12,454 --> 00:16:15,319
HAVE ANOTHER CHILD TOGETHER.

566
00:16:15,319 --> 00:16:16,216
>> I WANT ANOTHER BABY,

567
00:16:16,216 --> 00:16:17,666
WHETHER THAT'S ADOPTING YOUR

568
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,426
BABY OR FOSTERING A BABY

569
00:16:19,426 --> 00:16:20,841
TO ADOPT.

570
00:16:20,841 --> 00:16:22,395
>> NOW, IF SHE DOESN'T WANT TO

571
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:23,499
GIVE IT UP RIGHT AWAY, WOULD YOU

572
00:16:23,499 --> 00:16:25,329
GUYS, LIKE, DO IT LATER ON?

573
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:27,227
>> YEAH, THIS ISN'T WHERE AS

574
00:16:27,227 --> 00:16:28,815
SOON AS THE BABY COMES OUT,

575
00:16:28,815 --> 00:16:30,230
WE'RE GOING TO SAY, "OKAY, WE'RE

576
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,507
THE ADOPTIVE PARENTS NOW.

577
00:16:31,507 --> 00:16:32,922
WE'RE MOM AND DAD, PERIOD,

578
00:16:32,922 --> 00:16:33,716
END OF DISCUSSION."

579
00:16:33,716 --> 00:16:34,407
NO.

580
00:16:34,407 --> 00:16:36,305
IF YOU ARE TOTALLY AT WIT'S END

581
00:16:36,305 --> 00:16:37,789
AND YOU HAVE TO GIVE THIS BABY

582
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:39,136
UP, THAT'S WHERE WE'D LIKE TO

583
00:16:39,136 --> 00:16:41,138
STEP IN, BUT UP UNTIL THAT

584
00:16:41,138 --> 00:16:42,760
POINT, SHE'S YOURS.

585
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,520
>> IF WE WOULD ADOPT THE BABY,

586
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:45,797
YOU WOULD STILL BE IN

587
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:46,591
THE BABY'S LIFE.

588
00:16:46,591 --> 00:16:47,765
>> I KNOW THAT.

589
00:16:47,765 --> 00:16:48,869
>> IS MATT OKAY WITH THAT?

590
00:16:48,869 --> 00:16:49,870
>> HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT

591
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,699
HE WANTS.

592
00:16:50,699 --> 00:16:54,151
I HOPE THAT HE'S GONNA GIVE SOME

593
00:16:54,151 --> 00:16:55,393
TYPE OF SUPPORT.

594
00:16:55,393 --> 00:16:57,775
I'M GOING TO TALK TO HIM, BUT IF

595
00:16:57,775 --> 00:16:59,328
WE GO DOWN THAT ROAD, I REALLY

596
00:16:59,328 --> 00:17:01,503
WOULD RATHER CHOOSE YOU TO BE

597
00:17:01,503 --> 00:17:02,987
THE PARENTS THAN PICK SOMEONE

598
00:17:02,987 --> 00:17:05,162
THAT I REALLY DON'T KNOW.

599
00:17:05,162 --> 00:17:06,266
>> WHAT DO YOUR PARENTS FEEL

600
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:07,129
ABOUT THIS?

601
00:17:07,129 --> 00:17:09,200
>> MY MOM IS JUST REALLY PUSHING

602
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,168
FOR THE ADOPTION AND FORCING

603
00:17:11,168 --> 00:17:13,308
ONE OPINION AND ONE OPINION ONLY

604
00:17:13,308 --> 00:17:14,274
DOWN MY THROAT.

605
00:17:14,274 --> 00:17:15,344
>> AND YOU DON'T WANT THAT?

606
00:17:15,344 --> 00:17:16,828
YOU WANT TO KEEP THE BABY?

607
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:17,795
>> WELL, I DO.

608
00:17:17,795 --> 00:17:19,728
BUT SHE'S MAKING IT SO THAT IT

609
00:17:19,728 --> 00:17:21,247
IS SO HARD FOR ME TO KEEP THE

610
00:17:21,247 --> 00:17:22,972
BABY WITH, YOU KNOW, NOT

611
00:17:22,972 --> 00:17:24,043
ALLOWING ME TO STAY IN THE

612
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,734
HOUSE, WITH--

613
00:17:25,734 --> 00:17:27,494
>> IF YOU TAKE CARE OF THE BABY,

614
00:17:27,494 --> 00:17:29,048
WHERE ARE YOU PLANNING ON GOING?

615
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,325
>> IT'S LIKE, I HAVE TO FIND

616
00:17:30,325 --> 00:17:32,603
SOMEWHERE TO GO.

617
00:17:32,603 --> 00:17:33,811
>> IT'S A BIG DECISION.

618
00:17:33,811 --> 00:17:36,400
IT'S A BIG DECISION.

619
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,435
[sighs]

620
00:17:37,435 --> 00:17:38,540
I WANT TO SEE WHAT'S BEST FOR

621
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,403
YOU AND THE BABY.

622
00:17:39,403 --> 00:17:40,507
I DON'T WANT YOU BEING OUT

623
00:17:40,507 --> 00:17:41,370
ON THE STREET.

624
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:43,407
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW IT WOULD

625
00:17:43,407 --> 00:17:45,443
WORK, BUT WE HAVE A NEXT-DOOR

626
00:17:45,443 --> 00:17:46,789
NEIGHBOR THAT HAS A BEDROOM.

627
00:17:46,789 --> 00:17:47,756
IT MIGHT BE ANOTHER OPTION.

628
00:17:47,756 --> 00:17:48,757
>> SHE NEEDS SOMEBODY TO STAY

629
00:17:48,757 --> 00:17:49,758
WITH HER, 'CAUSE SHE WANTS TO

630
00:17:49,758 --> 00:17:51,173
STAY IN THE HOUSE, BUT SHE CAN'T

631
00:17:51,173 --> 00:17:52,036
AFFORD IT.

632
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:52,968
YOU AND THE BABY WOULD HAVE

633
00:17:52,968 --> 00:17:53,762
SOMEWHERE TO LIVE.

634
00:17:53,762 --> 00:17:54,728
>> YOU'D BE RIGHT NEXT DOOR.

635
00:17:54,728 --> 00:17:55,660
>> RIGHT NEXT DOOR TO US.

636
00:17:55,660 --> 00:17:57,317
THE THING IS, WE NEED TO WAIT

637
00:17:57,317 --> 00:17:58,663
TILL THE BABY'S BORN,

638
00:17:58,663 --> 00:18:00,148
BECAUSE EVERY DAY THINGS ARE

639
00:18:00,148 --> 00:18:00,941
GOING TO CHANGE.

640
00:18:00,941 --> 00:18:02,081
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

641
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,013
LIKE, YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW

642
00:18:04,013 --> 00:18:05,325
HOW MUCH.

643
00:18:05,325 --> 00:18:07,051
IF I MOVE NEXT DOOR, THEN I CAN

644
00:18:07,051 --> 00:18:08,570
WAIT UNTIL AFTER THE BABY IS

645
00:18:08,570 --> 00:18:11,883
BORN TO MAKE THE BIG DECISION.

646
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:12,884
>> HEY, BRENDA.

647
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:13,713
>> HI, BRENDA.

648
00:18:13,713 --> 00:18:14,921
THIS IS ALEX, MY FRIEND.

649
00:18:14,921 --> 00:18:16,060
>> HI, ALEX.

650
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:16,923
>> HEY.

651
00:18:16,923 --> 00:18:17,924
>> BOY, IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE--

652
00:18:17,924 --> 00:18:18,994
SOON.

653
00:18:18,994 --> 00:18:20,444
>> YEAH.

654
00:18:20,444 --> 00:18:21,479
>> WELL, I'LL SHOW YOU THE ROOM,

655
00:18:21,479 --> 00:18:22,722
SEE IF YOU'RE INTERESTED.

656
00:18:22,722 --> 00:18:23,619
IT'S BIG ENOUGH FOR YOU

657
00:18:23,619 --> 00:18:24,310
AND THE BABY.

658
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:25,034
>> ALL RIGHT.

659
00:18:25,034 --> 00:18:27,658
>> OKAY?

660
00:18:27,658 --> 00:18:29,349
THIS IS THE ROOM THAT I HAVE,

661
00:18:29,349 --> 00:18:31,248
AND IT DOES HAVE A BIG

662
00:18:31,248 --> 00:18:32,663
WALK-IN CLOSET.

663
00:18:32,663 --> 00:18:33,629
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK ABOUT

664
00:18:33,629 --> 00:18:34,458
THE ROOM?

665
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:36,115
>> IT'S REALLY ROOMY, AND I'M

666
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:37,702
REALLY HAPPY THAT YOU HAVE THIS

667
00:18:37,702 --> 00:18:38,462
SPACE AVAILABLE.

668
00:18:38,462 --> 00:18:39,359
LIKE, I LIKE IT.

669
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:40,222
I REALLY DO.

670
00:18:40,222 --> 00:18:42,880
>> NOW, THE RENT IS $552

671
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,054
A MONTH, SO IT WOULD BE HALF.

672
00:18:45,054 --> 00:18:47,091
>> OKAY.

673
00:18:47,091 --> 00:18:48,368
THE FIRST OF EVERY MONTH.

674
00:18:48,368 --> 00:18:49,369
>> ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE TO

675
00:18:49,369 --> 00:18:52,165
AFFORD THAT WITH A NEWBORN?

676
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:53,408
>> I'VE GOT A JOB.

677
00:18:53,408 --> 00:18:54,754
I ALSO HELP OUT

678
00:18:54,754 --> 00:18:56,065
AT A DANCE STUDIO.

679
00:18:56,065 --> 00:18:56,997
>> OKAY.

680
00:18:56,997 --> 00:19:00,173
>> I'M TOTALLY OKAY WITH THAT.

681
00:19:00,173 --> 00:19:01,588
I'M RELIEVED TO HAVE A PLACE

682
00:19:01,588 --> 00:19:03,728
TO GO IF I TRY KEEPING THE BABY,

683
00:19:03,728 --> 00:19:05,696
BUT I REALLY NEED TO KNOW WHAT

684
00:19:05,696 --> 00:19:09,113
MATT THINKS.

685
00:19:09,113 --> 00:19:10,942
>> OHH.

686
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:13,221
[mumbling]

687
00:19:13,221 --> 00:19:14,256
>> SHE POOPED.

688
00:19:14,256 --> 00:19:16,362
>> OHH!

689
00:19:16,362 --> 00:19:17,708
SHE POOPED ON ME.

690
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:18,433
HANDS OFF.

691
00:19:18,433 --> 00:19:19,123
>> [laughs]

692
00:19:19,123 --> 00:19:20,711
LET ME GRAB A PAPER TOWEL.

693
00:19:20,711 --> 00:19:21,953
>> GNARLY.

694
00:19:21,953 --> 00:19:23,955
GO BACK IN YOUR CAGE.

695
00:19:23,955 --> 00:19:26,095
TAKE IT. TAKE IT. TAKE IT.

696
00:19:26,095 --> 00:19:26,993
>> OH, COME HERE, HONEY.

697
00:19:26,993 --> 00:19:27,959
>> SHE JUST DROPPED A DEUCE

698
00:19:27,959 --> 00:19:29,340
ON ME.

699
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:32,550
THAT'S DISRESPECTFUL.

700
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,413
>> OH, MY GOSH, YOU'RE

701
00:19:33,413 --> 00:19:36,485
RIDICULOUS.

702
00:19:36,485 --> 00:19:38,798
WELL, YOU KNOW, I DID MEET WITH

703
00:19:38,798 --> 00:19:40,834
BRENDA, BRIANNA'S NEIGHBOR.

704
00:19:40,834 --> 00:19:42,215
SHE HAD OFFERED ME SOMEWHERE

705
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:42,974
TO STAY.

706
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:44,183
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU WANTED.

707
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,322
LIKE, IT'S A PLACE YOU

708
00:19:45,322 --> 00:19:46,392
COULD STAY.

709
00:19:46,392 --> 00:19:47,910
>> BUT, YOU KNOW, ARE YOU GONNA

710
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:49,360
HELP OUT?

711
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,534
I JUST--I WANT YOU TO BE

712
00:19:50,534 --> 00:19:52,743
COMFORTABLE WITH WHATEVER

713
00:19:52,743 --> 00:19:54,331
DECISION WE COME UP WITH.

714
00:19:54,331 --> 00:19:56,643
LIKE, HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT

715
00:19:56,643 --> 00:19:57,506
ADOPTION?

716
00:19:57,506 --> 00:19:58,852
LIKE, I MEAN, WE HAVEN'T

717
00:19:58,852 --> 00:19:59,612
REALLY--

718
00:19:59,612 --> 00:20:01,545
>> I THINK THAT SOME PEOPLE,

719
00:20:01,545 --> 00:20:02,925
IT'S REALLY THE BEST OPTION

720
00:20:02,925 --> 00:20:03,650
FOR THEM.

721
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:06,377
>> UM, BRIANNA'S MOM AND DAD

722
00:20:06,377 --> 00:20:09,656
OFFERED TO ADOPT THE BABY.

723
00:20:09,656 --> 00:20:12,072
IT WOULD BE AN EXTREMELY OPEN

724
00:20:12,072 --> 00:20:12,970
ADOPTION.

725
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,765
>> IF IT'S THAT OPEN, THAT'S--

726
00:20:14,765 --> 00:20:15,869
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

727
00:20:15,869 --> 00:20:17,630
LIKE, AT LEAST I'M THINKING

728
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:19,045
ABOUT THE IDEA, YOU KNOW?

729
00:20:19,045 --> 00:20:20,702
LIKE, THIS SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY

730
00:20:20,702 --> 00:20:21,496
GOOD IDEA.

731
00:20:21,496 --> 00:20:22,462
WITH THIS, SHE'S RIGHT DOWN

732
00:20:22,462 --> 00:20:23,739
THE STREET, YOU KNOW?

733
00:20:23,739 --> 00:20:25,465
LIKE, THAT'S AN OFFER THAT YOU

734
00:20:25,465 --> 00:20:27,916
MIGHT NOT FIND ANYWHERE ELSE.

735
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:28,986
>> BUT I WANT, LIKE--

736
00:20:28,986 --> 00:20:31,885
I'M LIKING THE FEELING OF BEING

737
00:20:31,885 --> 00:20:32,817
CALLED, "MOMMY."

738
00:20:32,817 --> 00:20:34,233
>> YEAH, SEE YOU ARE.

739
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,717
YOU HAVE TO PUT HER BEFORE

740
00:20:35,717 --> 00:20:37,995
YOURSELF AND SAY, "WHAT'S GOING

741
00:20:37,995 --> 00:20:38,823
TO GIVE HER THE BEST

742
00:20:38,823 --> 00:20:39,824
OPPORTUNITIES TO HAVE A

743
00:20:39,824 --> 00:20:40,929
SUCCESSFUL LIFE?"

744
00:20:40,929 --> 00:20:43,863
THAT REQUIRES UBER MATURITY,

745
00:20:43,863 --> 00:20:44,726
YOU KNOW?

746
00:20:44,726 --> 00:20:46,245
LIKE, THAT'S JUST IT.

747
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:48,626
>> I JUST DON'T WANT TO NOT TRY.

748
00:20:48,626 --> 00:20:49,765
>> WITH YOUR JOB NOW, CAN YOU

749
00:20:49,765 --> 00:20:50,766
PAY FOR RENT AND FOOD FOR

750
00:20:50,766 --> 00:20:51,526
YOURSELF?

751
00:20:51,526 --> 00:20:52,734
CAN YOU PAY FOR ALL THAT ON HOW

752
00:20:52,734 --> 00:20:53,631
MUCH MONEY YOU'RE MAKING

753
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:54,287
RIGHT NOW?

754
00:20:54,287 --> 00:20:55,599
I DON'T THINK SO.

755
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:56,945
>> I COULD TRY.

756
00:20:56,945 --> 00:20:58,084
>> WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO?

757
00:20:58,084 --> 00:20:59,154
IT'S NOT, "I CAN TRY."

758
00:20:59,154 --> 00:21:00,259
YOU HAVE TO KNOW FOR A FACT YOU

759
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,225
CAN, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT

760
00:21:01,225 --> 00:21:02,019
TO HAPPEN.

761
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:04,055
>> I CAN'T ON MY OWN.

762
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:05,574
>> YOU CAN'T WITH ME THERE

763
00:21:05,574 --> 00:21:06,299
EITHER.

764
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:07,404
YOU CAN'T IF SOMEONE EVEN

765
00:21:07,404 --> 00:21:08,128
HELPS US.

766
00:21:08,128 --> 00:21:09,164
WE'RE WORKING PART-TIME,

767
00:21:09,164 --> 00:21:09,923
MINIMUM-WAGE JOBS

768
00:21:09,923 --> 00:21:11,787
IN HIGH SCHOOL, NOT EVEN

769
00:21:11,787 --> 00:21:13,237
COLLEGE YET.

770
00:21:13,237 --> 00:21:16,067
>> I THINK IF WE BOTH PUT IN

771
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:20,002
150% OF OUR EFFORT, IT COULD

772
00:21:20,002 --> 00:21:21,590
BE POSSIBLE.

773
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,627
BE POSSIBLE.
>> I DISAGREE.

774
00:21:23,627 --> 00:21:35,017
>> I DISAGREE.

775
00:21:35,017 --> 00:21:36,087
>> IT SUCKS THAT MATT DOESN'T

776
00:21:36,087 --> 00:21:37,330
THINK WE CAN HANDLE

777
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,331
BEING PARENTS.

778
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:40,540
I'M DUE THIS WEEK, AND I STILL

779
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,231
HAVEN'T MADE A DECISION.

780
00:21:42,231 --> 00:21:44,199
BRIANNA'S PARENTS OFFERED

781
00:21:44,199 --> 00:21:46,650
TO ADOPT THE BABY,

782
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,824
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, THEY'VE BEEN

783
00:21:48,824 --> 00:21:51,275
WANTING TO ADOPT AND BECAUSE I

784
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:52,897
DO KNOW THEM SO WELL.

785
00:21:52,897 --> 00:21:54,761
AND IT WOULD BE LIKE GIVING

786
00:21:54,761 --> 00:21:57,212
THEM TO SOMEONE THAT ISN'T

787
00:21:57,212 --> 00:21:58,731
A STRANGER TO ME.

788
00:21:58,731 --> 00:22:00,940
>> THEY HAVE A STABLE HOME.

789
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,356
IT VERY WELL COULD BE A WIN-WIN.

790
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:04,771
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT IT?

791
00:22:04,771 --> 00:22:06,566
>> IT SCARES ME, BECAUSE SHE IS

792
00:22:06,566 --> 00:22:08,844
SO CLOSE, AND I WOULD GET AS

793
00:22:08,844 --> 00:22:10,501
MUCH VISITATION AS I POSSIBLY

794
00:22:10,501 --> 00:22:14,022
COULD EVER ASK FOR, BUT AM I

795
00:22:14,022 --> 00:22:14,885
GOING TO BE OKAY WITH

796
00:22:14,885 --> 00:22:15,713
WATCHING HER--

797
00:22:15,713 --> 00:22:17,094
>> SOMEBODY ELSE RAISE HER,

798
00:22:17,094 --> 00:22:18,198
AND HER CALLING SOMEBODY ELSE

799
00:22:18,198 --> 00:22:19,268
"MOMMY" AND "DADDY."

800
00:22:19,268 --> 00:22:21,788
>> EXACTLY.

801
00:22:21,788 --> 00:22:24,550
WELL, WE ALSO TALKED ABOUT HOW

802
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:28,208
BRIANNA'S NEIGHBOR ALSO OFFERED

803
00:22:28,208 --> 00:22:29,348
ME SOMEWHERE TO STAY.

804
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,729
SHE'S LOOKING FOR A ROOMMATE.

805
00:22:31,729 --> 00:22:33,662
I WOULD BE PAYING BASICALLY

806
00:22:33,662 --> 00:22:35,699
HALF THE RENT AND HALF

807
00:22:35,699 --> 00:22:36,907
THE ELECTRICITY.

808
00:22:36,907 --> 00:22:38,460
>> ARE YOU PREPARING TO TELL ME

809
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:39,737
THAT YOU'RE KEEPING THE BABY

810
00:22:39,737 --> 00:22:40,738
AT BRENDA'S HOUSE?

811
00:22:40,738 --> 00:22:41,567
>> I DON'T EVEN KNOW

812
00:22:41,567 --> 00:22:42,361
WHAT I'M DOING.

813
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,293
>> HONEY, YOU KNOW WHAT DATE

814
00:22:44,293 --> 00:22:44,984
IT IS?

815
00:22:44,984 --> 00:22:46,537
>> I KNOW IT'S DAYS AWAY.

816
00:22:46,537 --> 00:22:49,402
I KNOW THAT.

817
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:51,439
I--I'M SO SCARED OF WHAT'S GOING

818
00:22:51,439 --> 00:22:52,854
TO HAPPEN AT THE HOSPITAL,

819
00:22:52,854 --> 00:22:54,925
TO HAPPEN AT THE HOSPITAL,
BECAUSE I DON'T EVEN KNOW.

820
00:22:54,925 --> 00:23:01,897
BECAUSE I DON'T EVEN KNOW.

821
00:23:01,897 --> 00:23:02,933
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

822
00:23:02,933 --> 00:23:05,073
WE'RE DOING, SO I TOOK MATT TO

823
00:23:05,073 --> 00:23:08,214
TALK TO BRIANNA'S PARENTS.

824
00:23:08,214 --> 00:23:10,768
>> SO WHAT DID ALEX SAY TO YOU

825
00:23:10,768 --> 00:23:12,183
ABOUT THIS?

826
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:13,668
>> PRETTY MUCH THAT JUST YOU

827
00:23:13,668 --> 00:23:14,910
GUYS ARE INTERESTED IN ADOPTION

828
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:17,844
AND VERY OPEN, I GUESS.

829
00:23:17,844 --> 00:23:19,708
>> I WANT A BABY, BAD.

830
00:23:19,708 --> 00:23:21,538
I JUST DON'T WANT TO DO THIS AND

831
00:23:21,538 --> 00:23:24,886
THEN, IN A YEAR OR TWO, YOU GUYS

832
00:23:24,886 --> 00:23:26,025
SAY, "OKAY, I WANT MY BABY."

833
00:23:26,025 --> 00:23:26,888
>> YEAH.

834
00:23:26,888 --> 00:23:28,545
YOU WOULD BE THE MOM.

835
00:23:28,545 --> 00:23:31,306
YOU WOULD SAY WHEN AND WHERE I

836
00:23:31,306 --> 00:23:33,584
WOULD BE ABLE TO VISIT, HOW MUCH

837
00:23:33,584 --> 00:23:34,999
I WOULD BE ABLE TO VISIT.

838
00:23:34,999 --> 00:23:36,932
>> WE'RE NOT PUSHING FOR,

839
00:23:36,932 --> 00:23:38,037
YOU KNOW, TO PUSH YOU OUT OF

840
00:23:38,037 --> 00:23:39,072
THE BABY'S LIFE.

841
00:23:39,072 --> 00:23:39,866
WE'RE HERE TO HELP.

842
00:23:39,866 --> 00:23:40,902
>> ALEX, WHERE--

843
00:23:40,902 --> 00:23:42,628
HAVE YOU GUYS TALKED ABOUT THIS?

844
00:23:42,628 --> 00:23:43,905
>> A COUPLE TIMES.

845
00:23:43,905 --> 00:23:45,113
>> WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT,

846
00:23:45,113 --> 00:23:47,287
I REALLY DON'T HAVE NEAR

847
00:23:47,287 --> 00:23:48,254
AS MUCH SAY AS SHE DOES,

848
00:23:48,254 --> 00:23:49,082
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

849
00:23:49,082 --> 00:23:50,187
>> YOU NEED TO PROVIDE FOR HER.

850
00:23:50,187 --> 00:23:52,431
THAT'S WHAT A DAD DOES.

851
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,571
>> YEAH, BUT SHE'S A SENIOR.

852
00:23:54,571 --> 00:23:56,296
I'M GONNA BE A JUNIOR.

853
00:23:56,296 --> 00:23:57,539
I HAVE TWO MORE YEARS OF SCHOOL.

854
00:23:57,539 --> 00:23:58,367
SHE HAS ONE.

855
00:23:58,367 --> 00:23:59,196
PLUS, YOU'RE WORKING

856
00:23:59,196 --> 00:23:59,990
A MINIMUM-WAGE JOB.

857
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:01,716
THAT BARELY WOULD MAKE ENDS MEET

858
00:24:01,716 --> 00:24:02,613
FOR YOURSELF.

859
00:24:02,613 --> 00:24:04,063
IT'S A DIFFICULT DECISION.

860
00:24:04,063 --> 00:24:05,098
>> HE'S THINKING GOOD.

861
00:24:05,098 --> 00:24:06,375
ARE YOU--DID YOU LISTEN TO HIM?

862
00:24:06,375 --> 00:24:07,480
>> YEAH, I AM LISTENING.

863
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,068
>> I THINK THE MOST LOGICAL

864
00:24:09,068 --> 00:24:11,380
THING TO DO, LIKE, I WOULD SAY,

865
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,243
WOULD BE ADOPTION.

866
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:13,797
BUT IT COMES DOWN TO HER.

867
00:24:13,797 --> 00:24:15,350
I KNOW YOU FEEL HER AND STUFF

868
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,007
LIKE THAT, BUT IN THIS

869
00:24:17,007 --> 00:24:18,595
SITUATION, EVERYBODY, NO MATTER

870
00:24:18,595 --> 00:24:20,355
WHICH ROUTE YOU CHOOSE,

871
00:24:20,355 --> 00:24:21,460
HAS TO MAKE SACRIFICES.

872
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,391
>> YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE

873
00:24:22,391 --> 00:24:23,151
EVERYBODY HAPPY.

874
00:24:23,151 --> 00:24:23,910
>> NO.

875
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:24,842
>> NO MATTER WHAT DECISION

876
00:24:24,842 --> 00:24:25,464
YOU MAKE.

877
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:26,568
>> THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS,

878
00:24:26,568 --> 00:24:27,535
YOU HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT

879
00:24:27,535 --> 00:24:29,053
SHE HAS EVERYTHING THAT SHE

880
00:24:29,053 --> 00:24:30,123
COULD HAVE.

881
00:24:30,123 --> 00:24:31,193
>> IT'S A BIG DECISION, AND

882
00:24:31,193 --> 00:24:32,367
THE BABY'S GOING TO BE HERE.

883
00:24:32,367 --> 00:24:33,333
WITH HEARING HIM

884
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:34,507
AND ALL EVERYTHING ELSE,

885
00:24:34,507 --> 00:24:36,475
WHAT ARE YOU FEELING?

886
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,477
>> THAT ADOPTION IS PROBABLY

887
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,685
GOING TO BE THE BEST BET.

888
00:24:39,685 --> 00:24:40,962
>> BELIEVE ME, I'M NOT TAKING

889
00:24:40,962 --> 00:24:41,756
SIDES OR ANYTHING.

890
00:24:41,756 --> 00:24:42,377
>> YEAH.

891
00:24:42,377 --> 00:24:43,482
>> WE'RE NOT PUSHING YOU, LIKE,

892
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:44,344
"OH, WE WANT THE BABY.

893
00:24:44,344 --> 00:24:45,138
WE WANT THE BABY."

894
00:24:45,138 --> 00:24:45,967
>> OH, YEAH, I KNOW.

895
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:46,726
>> AND, YOU KNOW,

896
00:24:46,726 --> 00:24:47,486
YOU JUST GO AWAY.

897
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:48,348
>> I DO WANT A BABY.

898
00:24:48,348 --> 00:24:49,384
>> OH, I KNOW YOU DO, BUT WE GOT

899
00:24:49,384 --> 00:24:50,316
TO GIVE THEM THE CHANCE.

900
00:24:50,316 --> 00:24:52,042
WAIT TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

901
00:24:52,042 --> 00:24:53,630
THE BABY COMES, BECAUSE YOU

902
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,320
DON'T KNOW.

903
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,494
I MEAN, YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED

904
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:56,805
OF WHAT A BABY WILL DO

905
00:24:56,805 --> 00:24:58,393
TO EVERYBODY.

906
00:24:58,393 --> 00:24:59,808
>> EVEN THOUGH I'M LEANING

907
00:24:59,808 --> 00:25:01,430
TOWARDS LETTING BRIANNA'S FAMILY

908
00:25:01,430 --> 00:25:03,605
ADOPT THE BABY, I UNDERSTAND

909
00:25:03,605 --> 00:25:05,124
THAT THEY WANT ME TO BE SURE,

910
00:25:05,124 --> 00:25:07,298
SO I DECIDED TO MOVE SOME OF MY

911
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:09,749
STUFF IN NEXT DOOR.

912
00:25:09,749 --> 00:25:11,820
STUFF IN NEXT DOOR.
>> AND DROP IT.

913
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:18,309
>> AND DROP IT.

914
00:25:18,309 --> 00:25:19,379
>> READY, MOMMY?

915
00:25:19,379 --> 00:25:22,831
>> YEP.

916
00:25:22,831 --> 00:25:24,453
SINCE I DON'T HAVE EVERYTHING

917
00:25:24,453 --> 00:25:26,041
SET UP YET, I'M SPENDING THE

918
00:25:26,041 --> 00:25:27,111
NIGHT AT BRIANNA'S.

919
00:25:27,111 --> 00:25:30,701
>> YOU'RE A GOOD BOY.

920
00:25:30,701 --> 00:25:31,978
>> WHEN I WOKE UP THE NEXT

921
00:25:31,978 --> 00:25:33,566
MORNING, I WAS IN REALLY

922
00:25:33,566 --> 00:25:35,050
BAD PAIN.

923
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,673
UGH.

924
00:25:36,673 --> 00:25:39,089
OH, MY GOD.

925
00:25:39,089 --> 00:25:44,404
BRI, I'M HAVING A CONTRACTION.

926
00:25:44,404 --> 00:25:46,993
>> YOU GETTING ANOTHER ONE?

927
00:25:46,993 --> 00:25:48,719
>> TODAY MIGHT BE THE DAY, GIRL.

928
00:25:48,719 --> 00:25:50,790
>> TODAY MIGHT BE THE DAY, GIRL.
>> THAT BABY'S A-COMIN'.

929
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:58,626
>> THAT BABY'S A-COMIN'.

930
00:25:58,626 --> 00:26:00,628
>> [exhaling sharply]

931
00:26:00,628 --> 00:26:02,526

ACCOUNT, AND THE RENT'S DUE.

1115
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:22,207
>> THEN I'M OUT OF LUCK.

1116
00:33:22,207 --> 00:33:23,208
THAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH--

1117
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:24,485
>> HONEY, I KNOW.

1118
00:33:24,485 --> 00:33:25,520
I KNOW, I KNOW.

1119
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:26,590
I'M SCARED, BECAUSE I KNOW

1120
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,696
I'M SCARED, BECAUSE I KNOW
THE HARD PART'S COMING.

1121
00:33:28,696 --> 00:33:40,432
THE HARD PART'S COMING.

1122
00:33:40,432 --> 00:33:41,502
HONEY, I AM NOT TRYING

1123
00:33:41,502 --> 00:33:43,124
TO MAKE YOU FEEL BAD.

1124
00:33:43,124 --> 00:33:45,368
NOW THAT YOU HAVE HER, YOU CAN'T

1125
00:33:45,368 --> 00:33:49,682
BE WISHY-WASHY, OKAY?

1126
00:33:49,682 --> 00:33:51,926
JUST KNOW--KNOW WHO'S GONNA BE

1127
00:33:51,926 --> 00:33:53,997
JUST KNOW--KNOW WHO'S GONNA BE
THERE FOR YOU.

1128
00:33:53,997 --> 00:34:05,388
THERE FOR YOU.

1129
00:34:05,388 --> 00:34:06,389
>> AS HARD AS IT WAS TO TELL

1130
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:08,046
EVERYONE I'M KEEPING MY BABY,

1131
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,806
NOW I HAVE TO PROVE THAT I CAN

1132
00:34:09,806 --> 00:34:11,739
DO IT ON MY OWN, AND THAT STARTS

1133
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:14,328
BY SETTING UP OUR NEW PLACE.

1134
00:34:14,328 --> 00:34:16,813
WE ARE HOME SWEET HOME.

1135
00:34:16,813 --> 00:34:19,195
WE ARE HOME SWEET HOME.
YOU OKAY, SWEET PEA?

1136
00:34:19,195 --> 00:34:30,447
YOU OKAY, SWEET PEA?

1137
00:34:30,447 --> 00:34:31,793
[laughter]

1138
00:34:31,793 --> 00:34:34,762
>> SHE POOPED.

1139
00:34:34,762 --> 00:34:38,248
[baby crying]

1140
00:34:38,248 --> 00:34:40,492
YOU HAVE IT ON YOUR HANDS.

1141
00:34:40,492 --> 00:34:43,909
[laughing]

1142
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:45,048
SO HOW YOU FEELING ABOUT

1143
00:34:45,048 --> 00:34:46,014
SPENDING YOUR FIRST NIGHT

1144
00:34:46,014 --> 00:34:46,774
OVER HERE?

1145
00:34:46,774 --> 00:34:47,740
>> I'M NERVOUS.

1146
00:34:47,740 --> 00:34:48,741
>> IS MATT GONNA COME BACK

1147
00:34:48,741 --> 00:34:49,432
TONIGHT?

1148
00:34:49,432 --> 00:34:50,847
>> I TOLD HIM, YOU KNOW,

1149
00:34:50,847 --> 00:34:52,435
IF HE WANTS.

1150
00:34:52,435 --> 00:34:54,506
IF HE WANTS.
IT'S UP TO HIM.

1151
00:34:54,506 --> 00:34:59,097
IT'S UP TO HIM.

1152
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:02,134
IT'S UP TO HIM.

SHH, SHH, SHH, SHH.

1156

ARABELLA.

1157
00:35:26,572 --> 00:35:28,678
ARABELLA.
ARABELLA.

1158
00:35:28,678 --> 00:35:47,386
ARABELLA.

1159
00:35:47,386 --> 00:35:50,458
ARABELLA.

1160
00:35:50,458 --> 00:35:53,185
[baby fussing]

1161
00:35:53,185 --> 00:35:54,428
I CAN'T BELIEVE MATT DISAPPEARED

1162
00:35:54,428 --> 00:35:56,913
ON ARABELLA'S FIRST NIGHT HOME.

1163
00:35:56,913 --> 00:35:58,363
AND TO MAKE THINGS WORSE,

1164
00:35:58,363 --> 00:36:02,229
MY EXPENSES ARE PILING UP.

1165
00:36:02,229 --> 00:36:05,439
>> COME HERE, BABY GIRL.

1166
00:36:05,439 --> 00:36:07,751
NOW, DO WE WANT TO TALK ABOUT

1167
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:10,823
PAYING BILLS AND STUFF?

1168
00:36:10,823 --> 00:36:13,309
>> UM...

1169
00:36:13,309 --> 00:36:15,138
AUGUST 1ST, I'M GOING TO BE

1170
00:36:15,138 --> 00:36:15,966
WRITING YOU A CHECK,

1171
00:36:15,966 --> 00:36:16,898
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

1172
00:36:16,898 --> 00:36:18,210
OR, WELL, OBVIOUSLY I'LL WRITE

1173
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:19,867
IT BEFORE, BUT I'LL PUT THE DATE

1174
00:36:19,867 --> 00:36:23,733
AT THE TOP FOR AUGUST 1ST.

1175
00:36:23,733 --> 00:36:25,355
EVEN THOUGH I'M WRITING BRENDA A

1176
00:36:25,355 --> 00:36:27,323
CHECK, I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH CASH

1177
00:36:27,323 --> 00:36:29,187
IN MY ACCOUNT TO COVER RENT.

1178
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:30,533
I THOUGHT I'D BE BACK TO WORK

1179
00:36:30,533 --> 00:36:33,087
BY NOW, BUT LOOKING AFTER ABABY

1180
00:36:33,087 --> 00:36:34,813
IS A FULL-TIME JOB.

1181
00:36:34,813 --> 00:36:36,677
I NEED MATT'S HELP, BUT WHEN

1182
00:36:36,677 --> 00:36:38,196
HE FINALLY SHOWED UP,

1183
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,162
HE LOOKED LIKE HE'D BEEN

1184
00:36:39,162 --> 00:36:41,923
PARTYING ALL NIGHT.

1185
00:36:41,923 --> 00:36:42,752
>> I THINK SHE WENT

1186
00:36:42,752 --> 00:36:43,787
TO THE BATHROOM.

1187
00:36:43,787 --> 00:36:44,685
YOU MIGHT HAVE TO CHANGE

1188
00:36:44,685 --> 00:36:47,550
HER ONESIE.

1189
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:50,242
ALEX, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1190
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:53,141
YEAH, WATCH HER HEAD.

1191
00:36:53,141 --> 00:36:56,973
[baby crying]

1192
00:36:56,973 --> 00:37:00,528
>> I NEED YOUR HELP WITH THIS.

1193
00:37:00,528 --> 00:37:02,427
IT WAS NICE, 'CAUSE YOU STAYED

1194
00:37:02,427 --> 00:37:03,704
WITH ME IN THE HOSPITAL,

1195
00:37:03,704 --> 00:37:05,844
AND I WAS ABLE TO SLEEP.

1196
00:37:05,844 --> 00:37:07,121
YOU'RE NOT HERE NOW.

1197
00:37:07,121 --> 00:37:09,399
IT'S TOUGH ON ME.

1198
00:37:09,399 --> 00:37:10,987
>> I'LL HELP AGAIN.

1199
00:37:10,987 --> 00:37:12,471
>> I MEAN, I AM GONNA NEED A LOT

1200
00:37:12,471 --> 00:37:14,404
OF FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM YOU.

1201
00:37:14,404 --> 00:37:15,923
>> YEAH, THAT'S FINE.

1202
00:37:15,923 --> 00:37:17,165
>> HOW IS, LIKE, YOUR PLANS

1203
00:37:17,165 --> 00:37:18,201
WITH A JOB?

1204
00:37:18,201 --> 00:37:19,237
>> I'LL PROBABLY GET ONE

1205
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,308
>> I'LL PROBABLY GET ONE
SOMEWHERE, LIKE A FACTORY.

1206
00:37:21,308 --> 00:37:24,552
SOMEWHERE, LIKE A FACTORY.

1207
00:37:24,552 --> 00:37:27,245
>> OKAY.

1208
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,522
>> IT'LL BE FINE.

1209
00:37:28,522 --> 00:37:30,972
I'LL DO MY BEST.

1210
00:37:30,972 --> 00:37:34,424
THAT'S ALL I CAN DO.

1211
00:37:34,424 --> 00:37:37,427
WHAT?

1212
00:37:37,427 --> 00:37:38,946
>> YOU JUST LOOK REALLY SICK.

1213
00:37:38,946 --> 00:37:39,912
>> I'M TIRED.

1214
00:37:39,912 --> 00:37:40,741
I DON'T FEEL GOOD.

1215
00:37:40,741 --> 00:37:41,604
I BARELY SLEPT AT ALL

1216
00:37:41,604 --> 00:37:42,260
LAST NIGHT.

1217
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,122
>> LET'S SEE.

1218
00:37:43,122 --> 00:37:44,400
SHE WAS UP AT 3:30.

1219
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,298
THEN SHE WAS UP AT 5:30.

1220
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:47,472
SHE WAS UP AT 6:00.

1221
00:37:47,472 --> 00:37:49,991
>> SORRY, I'M JUST TIRED.

1222
00:37:49,991 --> 00:37:50,958
>> DO YOU WANT TO GET GOING,

1223
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:53,236
THEN, SO YOU CAN GET SOME SLEEP?

1224
00:37:53,236 --> 00:37:54,133
>> LET ME HOLD HER QUICK

1225
00:37:54,133 --> 00:37:56,688
BEFORE I GO.

1226
00:37:56,688 --> 00:37:58,655
I GOT HER.

1227
00:37:58,655 --> 00:38:00,278
I'LL PROBABLY COME SEE YOU

1228
00:38:00,278 --> 00:38:04,523
TOMORROW.

1229
00:38:04,523 --> 00:38:06,594
TOMORROW.
THERE YOU GO.

1230
00:38:06,594 --> 00:38:18,296
THERE YOU GO.

1231
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:19,366
>> UGH.

1232
00:38:19,366 --> 00:38:21,057
IT'S BEEN OVER A WEEK SINCE I

1233
00:38:21,057 --> 00:38:22,886
ASKED MATT FOR MONEY, BUT I

1234
00:38:22,886 --> 00:38:24,509
HAVEN'T SEEN A DIME,

1235
00:38:24,509 --> 00:38:26,373
AND I'M STILL DOING EVERYTHING

1236
00:38:26,373 --> 00:38:27,408
ON MY OWN.

1237
00:38:27,408 --> 00:38:30,480
ON MY OWN.

[baby crying]

1240
00:38:34,864 --> 00:38:37,315
ARABELLA!

1241
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,523
IF THIS IS HOW MATT'S GOING TO

1242
00:38:38,523 --> 00:38:40,456
BE, I'M STARTING TO THINK I NEED

1243
00:38:40,456 --> 00:38:43,804
TO MOVE BACK IN WITH MY MOM.

1244
00:38:43,804 --> 00:38:44,943
I REALLY WANT TO BE BACK

1245
00:38:44,943 --> 00:38:46,254
WITH MY FAMILY,

1246
00:38:46,254 --> 00:38:47,601
BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE I FEEL

1247
00:38:47,601 --> 00:38:48,360
COMFORTABLE.

1248
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:49,396
YOU KNOW, THERE'S MORE

1249
00:38:49,396 --> 00:38:50,707
SPACE HERE.

1250
00:38:50,707 --> 00:38:51,708
>> YOU CAN LIVE HERE.

1251
00:38:51,708 --> 00:38:53,261
THIS IS YOUR HOME, OKAY?

1252
00:38:53,261 --> 00:38:55,678
YOU AREN'T BY YOURSELF, AND I

1253
00:38:55,678 --> 00:38:57,404
WILL HELP YOU IF I CAN.

1254
00:38:57,404 --> 00:39:00,234
BUT ALL I WANT YOU TO REALIZE

1255
00:39:00,234 --> 00:39:03,444
IS, THE LACK OF PLANNING IS NOT

1256
00:39:03,444 --> 00:39:05,135
BEING A RESPONSIBLE PARENT.

1257
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:06,240
>> I KNOW, AND I'M TRYING TO GET

1258
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,034
IT TOGETHER.

1259
00:39:07,034 --> 00:39:07,897
>> NOT REALLY.

1260
00:39:07,897 --> 00:39:09,070
RIGHT NOW, YOU ARE CURRENTLY

1261
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:10,002
CATCHING UP EVERYTHING THAT

1262
00:39:10,002 --> 00:39:11,866
SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE

1263
00:39:11,866 --> 00:39:12,867
SIX MONTHS AGO.

1264
00:39:12,867 --> 00:39:14,110
>> BUT SIX MONTHS AGO, WE DIDN'T

1265
00:39:14,110 --> 00:39:16,043
THINK I WAS KEEPING THE BABY.

1266
00:39:16,043 --> 00:39:17,320
YOU KNOW, THREE WEEKS AGO, NONE

1267
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,494
OF US REALLY THOUGHT--

1268
00:39:18,494 --> 00:39:19,460
>> WHAT DO YOU HAVE PREPARED

1269
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,428
FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS?

1270
00:39:21,428 --> 00:39:22,739
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1271
00:39:22,739 --> 00:39:24,362
>> THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

1272
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:25,535
YOU DIDN'T PLAN.

1273
00:39:25,535 --> 00:39:26,778
YOU DIDN'T PREPARE.

1274
00:39:26,778 --> 00:39:27,744
AND THEN YOU WOUND UP

1275
00:39:27,744 --> 00:39:29,056
IN A SITUATION THAT ESCALATED

1276
00:39:29,056 --> 00:39:32,335
OUT OF CONTROL.

1277
00:39:32,335 --> 00:39:33,474
IT IS WHAT IT IS.

1278
00:39:33,474 --> 00:39:34,441
NOW WE'VE GOT TO LOOK TOWARDS

1279
00:39:34,441 --> 00:39:35,338
WHAT'S NEXT.

1280
00:39:35,338 --> 00:39:36,822
SCHOOL'S STARTING.

1281
00:39:36,822 --> 00:39:38,065
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

1282
00:39:38,065 --> 00:39:39,722
>> THIS HELTER-SKELTER LIFESTYLE

1283
00:39:39,722 --> 00:39:41,793
HAS TO STOP, ALL RIGHT?

1284
00:39:41,793 --> 00:39:43,726
>> YEAH.

1285
00:39:43,726 --> 00:39:45,348
I'M GLAD MY MOM IS OKAY

1286
00:39:45,348 --> 00:39:47,350
WITH ME MOVING BACK IN,

1287
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:48,593
BUT I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE RENT

1288
00:39:48,593 --> 00:39:49,835
I OWE BRENDA.

1289
00:39:49,835 --> 00:39:51,009
MY MOM AND I WERE TALKING

1290
00:39:51,009 --> 00:39:52,355
AND EVERYTHING, AND I ONLY HAVE

1291
00:39:52,355 --> 00:39:53,874
$300 IN THE BANK ACCOUNT.

1292
00:39:53,874 --> 00:39:55,876
AND RENT WOULD BE $260.

1293
00:39:55,876 --> 00:39:56,946
THAT LEAVES ME WITH

1294
00:39:56,946 --> 00:39:58,154
PRACTICALLY NOTHING.

1295
00:39:58,154 --> 00:39:59,051
>> BROKE DOESN'T FLY

1296
00:39:59,051 --> 00:40:00,294
WITH A BABY.

1297
00:40:00,294 --> 00:40:01,675
>> I KNOW.

1298
00:40:01,675 --> 00:40:04,781
SO MY MOM OFFERED ME TO STAY

1299
00:40:04,781 --> 00:40:05,472
WITH HER.

1300
00:40:05,472 --> 00:40:06,369
>> OH, THAT'S GOOD.

1301
00:40:06,369 --> 00:40:07,922
>> BUT, LIKE, I DON'T THINK

1302
00:40:07,922 --> 00:40:09,786
BRENDA CAN AFFORD THE RENT,

1303
00:40:09,786 --> 00:40:12,306
AND NOW BRI AND HER MOM, THEY

1304
00:40:12,306 --> 00:40:13,859
WERE SAYING THAT I SHOULD STILL

1305
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:16,655
PAY BRENDA THE RENT FOR AUGUST.

1306
00:40:16,655 --> 00:40:18,899
>> IT'S JUST A BOGUS SITUATION.

1307
00:40:18,899 --> 00:40:20,383
>> WELL, I TOLD THEM I'LL PICK

1308
00:40:20,383 --> 00:40:21,246
UP ALL MY STUFF.

1309
00:40:21,246 --> 00:40:22,420
YOU KNOW, DON'T TOUCH IT.

1310
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:23,835
I'LL TAKE CARE OF ALL OF IT.

1311
00:40:23,835 --> 00:40:24,594
DON'T WORRY ABOUT

1312
00:40:24,594 --> 00:40:26,078
DOING ANYTHING.

1313
00:40:26,078 --> 00:40:27,666
I TEXTED BRENDA, TELLING HER

1314
00:40:27,666 --> 00:40:29,219
I CAN'T PAY THE RENT, BUT I

1315
00:40:29,219 --> 00:40:30,497
HAVEN'T TALKED TO HER IN PERSON,

1316
00:40:30,497 --> 00:40:31,463
BECAUSE MY MOM QUICKLY THREW

1317
00:40:31,463 --> 00:40:32,602
TOGETHER A WELCOME PARTY FOR

1318
00:40:32,602 --> 00:40:34,673
TOGETHER A WELCOME PARTY FOR
ARABELLA.

1319
00:40:34,673 --> 00:40:39,126
ARABELLA.

1320
00:40:39,126 --> 00:40:41,369
>> YOU ARE WIDE AWAKE NOW.

1321
00:40:41,369 --> 00:40:43,441
>> YOU ARE WIDE AWAKE NOW.
>> SHE'S OPENING PRESENTS!

1322
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:47,686
>> SHE'S OPENING PRESENTS!

1323
00:40:47,686 --> 00:40:48,825
[laughter]

1324
00:40:48,825 --> 00:40:49,447
>> YEAH.

1325
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:50,482
>> THINK OF ALL THE MONEY YOU'RE

1326
00:40:50,482 --> 00:40:51,449
GOING TO SAVE.

1327
00:40:51,449 --> 00:40:52,242
>> THANK HEAVEN

1328
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:53,347
FOR LITTLE GIRLS.

1329
00:40:53,347 --> 00:40:54,624
>> THAT'S CUTE.

1330
00:40:54,624 --> 00:40:56,246
>> OH, MY...

1331
00:40:56,246 --> 00:40:58,870
>> all: AWW!

1332
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:02,460
>> CUTE.

1333
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:06,084
>> OH, MY GOD.

1334
00:41:06,084 --> 00:41:07,499
BRENDA TEXTED ME AND TOLD ME

1335
00:41:07,499 --> 00:41:08,880
THAT IF I DON'T COME RIGHT NOW

1336
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,881
TO GET MY STUFF, IT'S GOING

1337
00:41:09,881 --> 00:41:10,951
ON THE CURB.

1338
00:41:10,951 --> 00:41:12,366
>> BUT NOW IS NOT THE TIME.

1339
00:41:12,366 --> 00:41:13,816
IT IS A SHOWER, OKAY?

1340
00:41:13,816 --> 00:41:14,920
>> IT'S A BABY SHOWER.

1341
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,301
>> NO, IT'S A WELCOME PARTY,

1342
00:41:16,301 --> 00:41:17,336
OKAY?

1343
00:41:17,336 --> 00:41:18,337
WE'LL WORK IT OUT.

1344
00:41:18,337 --> 00:41:19,407
AT SOME POINT THIS EVENING,

1345
00:41:19,407 --> 00:41:20,650
I WILL GO, AND I WILL TAKE CARE

1346
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:21,479
OF IT, OKAY?

1347
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,445
>> NO, BECAUSE SHE WANTS ME

1348
00:41:22,445 --> 00:41:23,135
THERE NOW.

1349
00:41:23,135 --> 00:41:23,998
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER.

1350
00:41:23,998 --> 00:41:25,034
YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF WHAT YOU

1351
00:41:25,034 --> 00:41:25,828
NEED TO BE DOING.

1352
00:41:25,828 --> 00:41:26,760
>> THAT'S WHAT I TOLD HER.

1353
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,416
AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN [bleep]

1354
00:41:28,416 --> 00:41:29,314
TO HER.

1355
00:41:29,314 --> 00:41:30,384
I'M GRABBING MY STUFF,

1356
00:41:30,384 --> 00:41:33,594
AND I'M LEAVING.

1357
00:41:33,594 --> 00:41:35,665
AND I'M LEAVING.
>> I'LL GO ALONG.

1358
00:41:35,665 --> 00:41:42,258
>> I'LL GO ALONG.

1359
00:41:42,258 --> 00:41:45,295
SLOW--SLOW DOWN.

1360
00:41:45,295 --> 00:41:46,952
>> OHH...

1361
00:41:46,952 --> 00:41:47,815
>> THERE'S YOUR STUFF,

1362
00:41:47,815 --> 00:41:48,540
ON THE CURB.

1363
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:50,611
ON THE CURB.
>> I'M CALLING MY MOM.

1364
00:41:50,611 --> 00:41:58,032
>> I'M CALLING MY MOM.

1365
00:41:58,032 --> 00:41:58,826
THOSE ARE HERS.

1366
00:41:58,826 --> 00:41:59,931
THEY'RE NOT MINE.

1367
00:41:59,931 --> 00:42:02,830
MOM, MY BED--ALL MY [bleep] IS

1368
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:03,969
SITTING OUT IN THE FREAKING

1369
00:42:03,969 --> 00:42:05,005
DRIVEWAY.

1370
00:42:05,005 --> 00:42:07,939
IT'S [bleep] DISGUSTING!

1371
00:42:07,939 --> 00:42:08,974
HAS ANYONE EVER HEARD OF

1372
00:42:08,974 --> 00:42:11,045
HAS ANYONE EVER HEARD OF
FREAKING SOPHISTICATION?

1373
00:42:11,045 --> 00:42:23,057
FREAKING SOPHISTICATION?

1374
00:42:23,057 --> 00:42:24,196
>> YOU KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS,

1375
00:42:24,196 --> 00:42:24,852
ALEX?

1376
00:42:24,852 --> 00:42:27,510
AND I'M GONNA SAY THIS.

1377
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:29,408
YOU'VE NEVER REALLY FIGURED OUT

1378
00:42:29,408 --> 00:42:30,996
EXACTLY HOW YOU'RE GONNA

1379
00:42:30,996 --> 00:42:31,859
GET THROUGH THE NEXT

1380
00:42:31,859 --> 00:42:32,722
COUPLE OF MONTHS.

1381
00:42:32,722 --> 00:42:34,759
COUPLE OF MONTHS.
GET IT TOGETHER.

1382
00:42:34,759 --> 00:42:47,357
GET IT TOGETHER.

1383
00:42:47,357 --> 00:42:48,669
>> ALWAYS MAKE SURE THE FLARES

1384
00:42:48,669 --> 00:42:49,946
OF THE DIAPER COME OUT,

1385
00:42:49,946 --> 00:42:50,913
'CAUSE IT HELPS PROTECT

1386
00:42:50,913 --> 00:42:53,467
ALL THE POOPIES IN IT.

1387
00:42:53,467 --> 00:42:54,606
THANK YOU, THOUGH, DUDE.

1388
00:42:54,606 --> 00:42:55,642
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

1389
00:42:55,642 --> 00:42:56,746
>> IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK HOME

1390
00:42:56,746 --> 00:42:57,989
WITH MY FAMILY.

1391
00:42:57,989 --> 00:42:59,611
MY GRANDFATHER EVEN OFFERED

1392
00:42:59,611 --> 00:43:01,475
TO GIVE ME A CAR SO I CAN GET TO

1393
00:43:01,475 --> 00:43:03,511
SCHOOL AND TO WORK WITHOUT

1394
00:43:03,511 --> 00:43:04,547
RELYING ON MY MOM.

1395
00:43:04,547 --> 00:43:06,722
>> LET'S GIVE IT A TRY.

1396
00:43:06,722 --> 00:43:09,483
IT'S GOT 160,000 MILES ON IT.

1397
00:43:09,483 --> 00:43:11,865
IT'S GOT ANOTHER 100,000 LEFT.

1398
00:43:11,865 --> 00:43:13,901
LET'S GO.

1399
00:43:13,901 --> 00:43:15,075
PUT ON YOUR TURN SIGNAL.

1400
00:43:15,075 --> 00:43:16,317
MAKE A LEFT.

1401
00:43:16,317 --> 00:43:18,388
MAKE A LEFT.
I THINK YOU'RE A NATURAL.

1402
00:43:18,388 --> 00:43:24,705
I THINK YOU'RE A NATURAL.

1403
00:43:24,705 --> 00:43:27,052
>> CAN I SAY HI?

1404
00:43:27,052 --> 00:43:28,329
I GOTCHA.

1405
00:43:28,329 --> 00:43:30,262
HI, BUDDY, HOW ARE YOU?

1406
00:43:30,262 --> 00:43:31,781
HI!

1407
00:43:31,781 --> 00:43:32,851
YOU HAVE TO FORM A PLAN.

1408
00:43:32,851 --> 00:43:33,611
YOU KNOW THIS.

1409
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,785
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

1410
00:43:35,785 --> 00:43:37,442
>> BUT, I MEAN, EVEN DAY CARE

1411
00:43:37,442 --> 00:43:38,926
FOR WHEN YOU'RE WORKING AND

1412
00:43:38,926 --> 00:43:39,755
EVERYTHING ELSE.

1413
00:43:39,755 --> 00:43:40,687
LIKE, WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO

1414
00:43:40,687 --> 00:43:41,722
WHEN YOU GO BACK TO SCHOOL?

1415
00:43:41,722 --> 00:43:43,931
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I SAID

1416
00:43:43,931 --> 00:43:45,623
ADOPTION WAS YOUR BEST OPTION,

1417
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:47,383
IS BECAUSE I'VE GOT A LOT OF

1418
00:43:47,383 --> 00:43:48,487
DIFFERENT THINGS THAT I JUGGLE,

1419
00:43:48,487 --> 00:43:49,212
OKAY?

1420
00:43:49,212 --> 00:43:50,697
>> I KNOW THAT, MOM.

1421
00:43:50,697 --> 00:43:52,457
>> I HAVE GOT TO GO, OKAY?

1422
00:43:52,457 --> 00:43:53,251
I GOT TO CHANGE.

1423
00:43:53,251 --> 00:43:54,217
I GOT STUFF TO DO.

1424
00:43:54,217 --> 00:43:55,598
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE SOON.

1425
00:43:55,598 --> 00:43:57,635
WE GOT TO GET OUT OF HERE SOON.
>> ALL RIGHT.

1426
00:43:57,635 --> 00:44:04,987
>> ALL RIGHT.

1427
00:44:04,987 --> 00:44:06,126
>> UM, I HAD

1428
00:44:06,126 --> 00:44:07,817
A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS.

1429
00:44:07,817 --> 00:44:09,267
I'LL BE ATTENDING SCHOOL

1430
00:44:09,267 --> 00:44:12,650
FOR 30 HOURS A WEEK.

1431
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:15,411
FOR 30 HOURS A WEEK.
HOW MUCH WOULD YOUR RATES BE?

1432
00:44:15,411 --> 00:44:18,897
HOW MUCH WOULD YOUR RATES BE?

1433
00:44:18,897 --> 00:44:20,968
HOW MUCH WOULD YOUR RATES BE?
>> OKAY.

1434
00:44:20,968 --> 00:44:27,906
>> OKAY.

1435
00:44:27,906 --> 00:44:30,806
>> UM, IT'S A LITTLE BIT

1436
00:44:30,806 --> 00:44:32,290
OUT OF MY RANGE.

1437
00:44:32,290 --> 00:44:34,361
OUT OF MY RANGE.
UM...

1438
00:44:34,361 --> 00:44:38,434
UM...

1439
00:44:38,434 --> 00:44:40,505
UM...
>> OKAY.

1440
00:44:40,505 --> 00:44:51,412
>> OKAY.

1441
00:44:51,412 --> 00:44:52,275
>> DAY CARES ARE JUST

1442
00:44:52,275 --> 00:44:53,414
RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE,

1443
00:44:53,414 --> 00:44:55,002
AND, FINANCIALLY, IT'S

1444
00:44:55,002 --> 00:44:56,728
IMPOSSIBLE TO DO IT.

1445
00:44:56,728 --> 00:44:57,902
>> SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

1446
00:44:57,902 --> 00:44:59,386
>> I TALKED TO THE SCHOOL ABOUT

1447
00:44:59,386 --> 00:45:00,836
SWITCHING TO CYBER SCHOOL.

1448
00:45:00,836 --> 00:45:02,838
BASICALLY, MY HIGH SCHOOL

1449
00:45:02,838 --> 00:45:04,460
EDUCATION, I'M GONNA BE GETTING

1450
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:07,359
OVER THE COMPUTER.

1451
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:09,051
>> MY CONCERN IS, IF YOU GO TO

1452
00:45:09,051 --> 00:45:10,431
CYBER SCHOOL, HOW ARE YOU GONNA

1453
00:45:10,431 --> 00:45:12,157
MAINTAIN YOUR GRADES.

1454
00:45:12,157 --> 00:45:15,057
>> IT'S GONNA BE HARD.

1455
00:45:15,057 --> 00:45:16,299
>> THE LACK OF SOCIAL

1456
00:45:16,299 --> 00:45:18,232
INTERACTION--

1457
00:45:18,232 --> 00:45:21,097
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?

1458
00:45:21,097 --> 00:45:22,202
>> I'M BUMMED ABOUT IT, 'CAUSE,

1459
00:45:22,202 --> 00:45:23,168
LIKE, I'M GONNA MISS, LIKE,

1460
00:45:23,168 --> 00:45:24,238
GENNA AND RAY.

1461
00:45:24,238 --> 00:45:25,619
IT'S SOMETHING I HAVE TO DO.

1462
00:45:25,619 --> 00:45:26,896
LIKE, I MADE THIS DECISION.

1463
00:45:26,896 --> 00:45:28,001
IT'S A SACRIFICE I HAVE TO

1464
00:45:28,001 --> 00:45:30,037
IT'S A SACRIFICE I HAVE TO
GIVE UP.

1465
00:45:30,037 --> 00:45:33,213
GIVE UP.

1466
00:45:33,213 --> 00:45:34,490
EVEN THOUGH MATT'S STILL NOT

1467
00:45:34,490 --> 00:45:35,871
BEEN AROUND, SUMMER'S ALMOST

1468
00:45:35,871 --> 00:45:37,493
OVER, I'M I'M TRYING TO SQUEEZE

1469
00:45:37,493 --> 00:45:39,115
IN AS MUCH TIME WITH MY FRIENDS

1470
00:45:39,115 --> 00:45:40,358
AS I CAN,

1471
00:45:40,358 --> 00:45:41,359
ESPECIALLY SINCE I'M SWITCHING

1472
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:42,498
TO ONLINE CLASSES FOR MY

1473
00:45:42,498 --> 00:45:44,569
TO ONLINE CLASSES FOR MY
SENIOR YEAR.

1474
00:45:44,569 --> 00:45:48,331

TO TAKE HER TO MY OTHER JOB,

1655
00:52:02,602 --> 00:52:04,086

WHERE I'M GOING.
>> MATT!

1838
00:57:22,093 --> 00:57:26,650
>> MATT!

1839
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:27,582
>> [bleep].

1840
00:57:27,582 --> 00:57:28,479
WHAT?

1841
00:57:28,479 --> 00:57:29,998
>> I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

1842
00:57:29,998 --> 00:57:31,033
WHAT THE [bleep] IS GOING

1843
00:57:31,033 --> 00:57:32,172
THROUGH YOUR HEAD!

1844
00:57:32,172 --> 00:57:33,450
WHETHER YOU WANT TO SEE THAT

1845
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,727
LITTLE GIRL WHO IS SITTING

1846
00:57:34,727 --> 00:57:36,901
IN THAT ROOM OR IF YOU WANT TO

1847
00:57:36,901 --> 00:57:38,455
WALK AWAY AND GO HANG OUT WITH

1848
00:57:38,455 --> 00:57:41,734
YOUR CRACKHEAD FRIENDS.

1849
00:57:41,734 --> 00:57:43,736
YOU'RE A [bleep] DEADBEAT DAD.

1850
00:57:43,736 --> 00:57:44,702
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

1851
00:57:44,702 --> 00:57:46,946
YOU ARE NOTHING.

1852
00:57:46,946 --> 00:57:48,672
YOU ARE A PART OF HER FAMILY,

1853
00:57:48,672 --> 00:57:52,123
BUT YOU CAN'T BE A [bleep] MAN.

1854
00:57:52,123 --> 00:57:54,091
ALL YOU DO, EVERY DAY,

1855
00:57:54,091 --> 00:57:55,230
IS HURT ME.

1856
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:57,059
I DON'T WANT YOU ANYWHERE NEAR

1857
00:57:57,059 --> 00:57:59,096
I DON'T WANT YOU ANYWHERE NEAR
MY DAUGHTER ANYMORE.

1858
00:57:59,096 --> 00:58:22,395
MY DAUGHTER ANYMORE.

1859
00:58:22,395 --> 00:58:25,467
MY DAUGHTER ANYMORE.
[crying]

1860
00:58:25,467 --> 00:58:31,956
[crying]

1861
00:58:31,956 --> 00:58:34,511
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO SIT

1862
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:35,995
HERE AND KEEP WAITING FOR MATT

1863
00:58:35,995 --> 00:58:38,100
TO JUST GROW UP AND DO WHAT

1864
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:40,240
HE NEEDS TO.

1865
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:44,486
AND I'M SCARED OF HAVING

1866
00:58:44,486 --> 00:58:45,867
TO DO IT BY MYSELF.

1867
00:58:45,867 --> 00:58:46,937
YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT TO BE

1868
00:58:46,937 --> 00:58:50,906
A SINGLE MOM, BUT NOW I HAVE TO.

1869
00:58:50,906 --> 00:58:52,770
[baby crying]

1870
00:58:52,770 --> 00:58:55,290
ARABELLA.

1871
00:58:55,290 --> 00:58:56,705
I LOVE MATT TO DEATH,

1872
00:58:56,705 --> 00:58:58,604
BUT HE'S NOT THE PERSON THAT I

1873
00:58:58,604 --> 00:59:02,400
FELL IN LOVE WITH TWO YEARS AGO.

1874
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:03,436
>> WHEN WAS THAT?

1875
00:59:03,436 --> 00:59:04,955
>> THE END OF AUGUST,

1876
00:59:04,955 --> 00:59:06,715
BEFORE SOPHOMORE YEAR.

1877
00:59:06,715 --> 00:59:08,199
>> OH, MY GOSH.

1878
00:59:08,199 --> 00:59:08,993
>> YEAH, LIKE RIGHT

1879
00:59:08,993 --> 00:59:10,305
IN THE BEGINNING.

1880
00:59:10,305 --> 00:59:14,309
>> SO MUCH HAS CHANGED.

1881
00:59:14,309 --> 00:59:15,413
>> IN THE BEGINNING OF MY

1882
00:59:15,413 --> 00:59:16,691
PREGNANCY, IT WAS REALLY,

1883
00:59:16,691 --> 00:59:17,588
REALLY SCARY.

1884
00:59:17,588 --> 00:59:21,281
I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

1885
00:59:21,281 --> 00:59:24,181
>> ARE YOU OKAY WITH EVERYTHING?

1886
00:59:24,181 --> 00:59:25,700
>> I'M STARTING TO GET VERY

1887
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:27,115
STRESSED, NOW THAT WE'RE

1888
00:59:27,115 --> 00:59:29,393
GETTING FARTHER INTO HER BEING

1889
00:59:29,393 --> 00:59:31,429
OLDER NOW.

1890
00:59:31,429 --> 00:59:36,124
ADOPTION IS AN AMAZING CHOICE.

1891
00:59:36,124 --> 00:59:37,504
I THINK IT GIVES A LOT OF

1892
00:59:37,504 --> 00:59:38,816
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE MOTHER

1893
00:59:38,816 --> 00:59:40,162
AS WELL AS THE BABY.

1894
00:59:40,162 --> 00:59:43,925
BUT THE PROBLEM I HAD WAS,

1895
00:59:43,925 --> 00:59:46,168
I COULDN'T LET GO.

1896
00:59:46,168 --> 00:59:48,757
I DIDN'T WANT TO LET GO.

1897
00:59:48,757 --> 00:59:49,724
CAN YOU HELP ME?

1898
00:59:49,724 --> 00:59:52,105
IF YOU COULD CHANGE HER QUICK.

1899
00:59:52,105 --> 00:59:53,590
NOW THAT SHE'S BORN,

1900
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:56,144
MY FAMILY HAS STEPPED UP,

1901
00:59:56,144 --> 00:59:58,318
AND NOW THEY STAND BEHIND ME,

1902
00:59:58,318 --> 00:59:59,596
AND THEY HELP ME AS MUCH AS

1903
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,011
THEY CAN.

1904
01:00:01,011 --> 01:00:01,908
BUT THEY DON'T DO

1905
01:00:01,908 --> 01:00:02,978
EVERYTHING FOR ME.

1906
01:00:02,978 --> 01:00:04,428
I'M GONNA BE PAYING FOR

1907
01:00:04,428 --> 01:00:05,602
EVERYTHING THAT SHE NEEDS

1908
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:07,742
ON MY OWN, AND IT'S GONNA BE

1909
01:00:07,742 --> 01:00:10,676
TOUGH FOR ME TO AFFORD COLLEGE.

1910
01:00:10,676 --> 01:00:12,263
SAY, "MOMMY HAS TO DO HER WORK."

1911
01:00:12,263 --> 01:00:13,333
WILL YOU BE GOOD WHILE MOMMY

1912
01:00:13,333 --> 01:00:14,507
DOES HER WORK?

1913
01:00:14,507 --> 01:00:15,957
SINCE SHE'S BEEN BORN, I'VE HAD

1914
01:00:15,957 --> 01:00:17,027
TO MAKE A LOT OF SACRIFICES

1915
01:00:17,027 --> 01:00:18,097
FOR HER.

1916
01:00:18,097 --> 01:00:19,374
I'VE GIVEN UP ALL MY FRIENDS.

1917
01:00:19,374 --> 01:00:21,514
I'VE GIVEN UP MY SENIOR YEAR

1918
01:00:21,514 --> 01:00:23,896
OF HIGH SCHOOL.

1919
01:00:23,896 --> 01:00:25,518
BEFORE I GOT PREGNANT, MY

1920
01:00:25,518 --> 01:00:27,727
NUMBER ONE GOAL AND PRIORITY

1921
01:00:27,727 --> 01:00:29,971
WAS TO OWN MY OWN DANCE STUDIO.

1922
01:00:29,971 --> 01:00:32,870
I STILL CAN FULFILL THAT GOAL...

1923
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:34,631
>> ALEX?

1924
01:00:34,631 --> 01:00:36,184
>> BUT IT'S GONNA TAKE ME

1925
01:00:36,184 --> 01:00:38,635
A LOT LONGER, AND I DON'T WANT

1926
01:00:38,635 --> 01:00:40,533
TO THROW IT OUT THE WINDOW

1927
01:00:40,533 --> 01:00:42,569
TO THROW IT OUT THE WINDOW
BECAUSE I HAD A BABY.

1928
01:00:42,569 --> 01:00:55,582
BECAUSE I HAD A BABY.

1929
01:00:55,582 --> 01:00:56,514
>> announcer: ON THE NEXT

1930
01:00:56,514 --> 01:00:57,343
 16 AND PREGNANT:

1931
01:00:57,343 --> 01:00:58,275
>> TY WON'T GET TO SEE THE

1932
01:00:58,275 --> 01:01:00,173
BABY BECAUSE SHE HAS A PROBLEM

1933
01:01:00,173 --> 01:01:01,209
WITH TYLER.

1934
01:01:01,209 --> 01:01:02,141
>> HE'S DISRESPECTFUL.

1935
01:01:02,141 --> 01:01:03,211
I DON'T LIKE HIM.

1936
01:01:03,211 --> 01:01:04,246
>> "HOW IS HE GONNA RAISE

1937
01:01:04,246 --> 01:01:05,454
A BLACK BABY?"

1938
01:01:05,454 --> 01:01:06,697
>> SHE IS NOT GONNA KEEP MY SON

1939
01:01:06,697 --> 01:01:07,560
AWAY FROM ME.

1940
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:08,354
>> YOU'RE MINE,

1941
01:01:08,354 --> 01:01:09,355
AND WHAT'S YOURS IS MINE.

1942
01:01:09,355 --> 01:01:10,183
>> IT'S NOT YOUR KID.

1943
01:01:10,183 --> 01:01:13,428
I'M GONNA TELL HER THAT I'M
