MOSTLY WITH MY MOM, BUT WE

8
00:00:13,114 --> 00:00:14,648
BOUNCED AROUND A LOT.

00:00:14,648 --> 00:00:15,983
ALL THAT MOVING AROUND MADE IT

10
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:17,051
HARD FOR ME TO HAVE A NORMAL

12
00:00:18,386 --> 00:00:19,653
I STARTED GETTING IN TROUBLE

AND CUTTING CLASS, AND

14
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:21,889
EVENTUALLY I DROPPED OUT

I THINK THE ONE THING THAT'S

57
00:01:33,894 --> 00:01:35,563
MAINLY IMPORTANT TO ME IS THAT

58
00:01:35,563 --> 00:01:37,064

SHE COULDN'T HELP US OUT.

79
00:02:10,331 --> 00:02:11,665
SO MY GRANDMA WAS KIND ENOUGH

TO TAKE US IN.

MY LIFE'S NOT GONNA STOP

182

JUST BECAUSE I'M HAVING A BABY,

183
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:31,672
AND EVERYONE SEEMS TO THINK

184
00:04:31,672 --> 00:04:32,506
THAT.

00:04:37,678 --> 00:04:39,012
OR GOING TO CULINARY SCHOOL.

190
00:04:39,012 --> 00:04:40,848
BRANDON AND I ARE GOING TO MAKE

191
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:42,182
THIS WORK.

192
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:43,484
BUT RIGHT NOW, I NEED TO GET

193
00:04:43,484 --> 00:04:44,852
READY FOR THE WEDDING.

194
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:46,019
SO I'M GOING TO THE MALL

195
00:04:46,019 --> 00:04:47,521
TO LOOK AT SHOES, EVEN THOUGH

196
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:49,189
MY CREDIT LINE MAXED OUT.

197
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:50,324
>> I LIKE THIS, THOUGH.

198
00:04:50,324 --> 00:04:50,991
>> THAT'S ACTUALLY

199
00:04:50,991 --> 00:04:51,592
REALLY PRETTY.

200
00:04:51,592 --> 00:04:52,326
>> SO SOFT.

201
00:04:52,326 --> 00:04:53,494
>> I KNOW.

202
00:04:53,494 --> 00:04:55,062
THESE SHOES ARE PERFECT.

203
00:04:55,062 --> 00:04:56,730
>> WHAT ARE THOSE SHOES FOR,

204
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,798
AUBREY?

205
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,133
>> THE WEDDING.

206
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,134
>> DO YOU HAVE CLOTHES PICKED

207
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:01,969
OUT, LIKE, WHAT YOU WANT

208
00:05:01,969 --> 00:05:03,003
TO WEAR?

209
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:03,837
>> YEAH.

210
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:05,339
SO I THINK--THAT'S WHY I THINK

211
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:08,742
THESE WILL MATCH.

212
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:09,543
>> HAVE YOU GUYS PICKED A DATE

213
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:10,778
YET?

214
00:05:10,778 --> 00:05:15,716
>> NEXT WEEK.

215
00:05:15,716 --> 00:05:17,785
GOOD TO GO.

216
00:05:17,785 --> 00:05:19,787
BRANDON HAS NO JOB, AND I'VE

217
00:05:19,787 --> 00:05:20,954
NEVER WORKED, SO WE'RE IN

218
00:05:20,954 --> 00:05:22,289
SERIOUS DEBT, AND WE NEED

219
00:05:22,289 --> 00:05:23,457
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET

220
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:24,692
OUT OF IT IF WE'RE EVER GOING

221
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:26,093
TO GET OUR OWN PLACE.

222
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:27,928
I'M GONNA TOTAL UP OUR STUFF

223
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:30,631
AND SEE HOW MUCH MONEY WE OWE,

224
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:31,965
SO THAT WE KIND OF HAVE AN IDEA

225
00:05:31,965 --> 00:05:33,801
OF WHAT WE NEED TO PAY OFF.

226
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,002
>> SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

227
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:36,904
>> THIS ONE SAYS, "DEAR BRANDON,

228
00:05:36,904 --> 00:05:38,305
YOUR DELINQUENT ACCOUNT HAS BEEN

229
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:39,306
TURNED OVER TO THE COLLECTION

230
00:05:39,306 --> 00:05:40,408
AGENCY.

231
00:05:40,408 --> 00:05:43,310
$329."

232
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:47,681
THIS ONE'S FOR $295.94.

233
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:48,682
>> AND YOUR AUNT.

234
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:49,917
>> OH, YEAH.

235
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:50,918
>> DO I OWE HER $500?

236
00:05:50,918 --> 00:05:51,919
>> $700.

237
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:52,720
>> $700.

238
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,221
SO THAT PUTS OUR TOTAL

239
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:59,326
AT $2,011.36.

240
00:06:03,731 --> 00:06:04,565
>> WELL, I'M HOPING TO HAVE

241
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:06,767
A JOB SOON.

242
00:06:06,767 --> 00:06:10,003
>> YEAH.

243
00:06:10,003 --> 00:06:12,673
>> WE HAVE TWO MONTHS TO COME UP

244
00:06:12,673 --> 00:06:14,675
WITH SOME WAY--SOME MEANS

245
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:18,512
OF STEADY FINANCIAL STABILITY.

246
00:06:18,512 --> 00:06:19,680
>> AND PAY OFF ALL THOSE BILLS.

247
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,714
>> AND PAY OFF ALL THE BILLS

248
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,349
AND GET EVERYTHING READY.

249
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:26,687
>> I GUESS WE'LL JUST HAVE TO...

250
00:06:26,687 --> 00:06:29,189
I DON'T KNOW.

251
00:06:29,189 --> 00:06:30,524
UNTIL YOU GET A JOB, IT'S GONNA

252
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:32,693
BE HARD TO PAY OFF BILLS.

253
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:33,694
>> I'LL LOOK FOR ODD JOBS,

254
00:06:33,694 --> 00:06:35,195
AND THEN I'LL START APPLYING

255
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,029
AT SOME OF THE OTHER PLACES

256
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,364
THAT I DIDN'T ALREADY APPLY TO,

257
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:38,532
AND THEN I WANT TO APPLY

258
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:39,533
AT BEST BUY.

259
00:06:39,533 --> 00:06:40,534
THAT'S SOMETHING I COULD DO,

260
00:06:40,534 --> 00:06:41,535
RIGHT?

261
00:06:41,535 --> 00:06:42,570
PROBABLY.

262
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,403
UNLESS THEY ASK ME ANYTHING

263
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,739
ABOUT COMPUTERS.

264
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:47,841
>> OR CAMERAS.

265
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:49,777
OR CELL PHONES.

266
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:53,313
OR ANYTHING ELECTRONIC.

267
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:55,315
>> [clears throat]

268
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:56,183
[chime dings]

269
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:58,018
>> OUR BILLS ARE PILING UP.

270
00:06:58,018 --> 00:07:00,187
WE HAVE NO JOBS AND NEED TO FIND

271
00:07:00,187 --> 00:07:01,689
A NEW PLACE TO LIVE

272
00:07:01,689 --> 00:07:03,691
ALL BEFORE THE BABY IS BORN.

273
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,200
>> I'M REALLY HAPPY BRANDON

274
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,535
AND I ARE GETTING MARRIED

275
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:15,235
AND ON OUR WAY TO BEING

276
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:16,904
A REAL FAMILY.

277
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:17,905
YOU COMING?

278
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:19,039
AND TODAY WE'RE HEADED TO

279
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,541
THE DOCTOR TO GET A GOOD LOOK AT

280
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:22,342
OUR BABY BOY FOR THE FIRST TIME.

281
00:07:22,342 --> 00:07:23,511
>> OKAY, LET'S JUST TAKE

282
00:07:23,511 --> 00:07:24,678
A LOOK FIRST AND SEE WHAT

283
00:07:24,678 --> 00:07:26,680
POSITION YOUR BABY IS IN.

284
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,281
>> HOLY CRAP, IT'S HUGE.

285
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,484
>> SO CRAZY.

286
00:07:30,484 --> 00:07:31,819
>> IF I COME IN FROM THE SIDE,

287
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:34,121
THERE'S THE PROFILE OF THE FACE.

288
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,757
>> SWEET BABY BOY AUSTIN.

289
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:37,424
>> AUSTIN.

290
00:07:37,424 --> 00:07:38,191
WHAT'S HIS MIDDLE NAME?

291
00:07:38,191 --> 00:07:38,759
>> CARTER.

292
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:39,927
>> THAT'S A GOOD NAME.

293
00:07:39,927 --> 00:07:41,762
>> YEAH.

294
00:07:41,762 --> 00:07:43,831
OH, HE'S JUST SO PERFECT.

295
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:48,636
I'M EXCITED.

296
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:50,504
I WANT TO MEET HIM.

297
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:52,640
>> OH...

298
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:53,941
>> TAKE CARE OF LITTLE AUSTIN.

299
00:07:53,941 --> 00:07:54,775
>> I WILL.

300
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:55,442
THANK YOU.

301
00:07:55,442 --> 00:07:57,444
SEEING AUSTIN MADE ME REALIZE

302
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:58,946
HOW MUCH OUR LIVES ARE ABOUT

303
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:00,213
TO CHANGE.

304
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:01,481
OUR WEDDING IS TOMORROW,

305
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,550
AND WE STILL DON'T HAVE

306
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:03,551
EVERYTHING WE NEED.

307
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:04,718
SO WE'RE DOING SOME LAST-MINUTE

308
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:05,519
SHOPPING.

309
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,186
>> NICE.

310
00:08:06,186 --> 00:08:07,020
>> MOST OF MY GARTERS ARE RIGHT

311
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:07,688
UP HERE.

312
00:08:07,688 --> 00:08:09,022
WHAT COLOR ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

313
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:09,857
>> BLUE.

314
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:11,692
I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING BLUE YET.

315
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:12,392
>> WHERE ARE YOU GETTING

316
00:08:12,392 --> 00:08:13,026
MARRIED AT?

317
00:08:13,026 --> 00:08:14,361
>> JUST IN THE COURTYARD.

318
00:08:14,361 --> 00:08:15,529
ALTHOUGH WE CAN'T AFFORD

319
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:17,030
A BIG WEDDING, GETTING MARRIED

320
00:08:17,030 --> 00:08:18,298
BEFORE THE BABY COMES

321
00:08:18,298 --> 00:08:19,499
IS IMPORTANT TO US,

322
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:20,801
BUT MY MOM DOESN'T SEE IT

323
00:08:20,801 --> 00:08:23,336
THAT WAY.

324
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:26,439
>> I KNOW IT'S GONNA BE ROUGH.

325
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,775
>> I THINK IT HELPS A LOT

326
00:08:27,775 --> 00:08:28,942
THAT WE'VE ALREADY LIVED

327
00:08:28,942 --> 00:08:31,912
TOGETHER ON OUR OWN.

328
00:08:31,912 --> 00:08:34,414
>> IT'S A LOT OF WORK,

329
00:08:34,414 --> 00:08:36,249
WHETHER YOU'RE YOUNG OR

330
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:39,152
A LITTLE BIT MORE MATURE,

331
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:40,621
AND IT'S GONNA BE DIFFICULT.

332
00:08:40,621 --> 00:08:41,622
>> I KNOW.

333
00:08:41,622 --> 00:08:42,890
I'M...

334
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,057
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT EXPECTING IT

335
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:46,193
TO BE A WALK IN THE PARK.

336
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:47,194
IT'S KIND OF HARD TO LISTEN

337
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,696
TO MY MOM'S ADVICE, BECAUSE SHE

338
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:50,430
HASN'T BEEN AROUND MUCH.

339
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:51,932
SHE HAS TO WORK TOMORROW,

340
00:08:51,932 --> 00:08:52,933
SO SHE'S NOT EVEN COMING

341
00:08:52,933 --> 00:08:54,101
TO MY WEDDING.

342
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:55,102
MY AUNT HAS AGREED TO HELP ME

343
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:56,637
GET READY, BUT EVEN SHE DOESN'T

344
00:08:56,637 --> 00:08:57,437
APPROVE.

345
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:58,371
>> AUBREY, I WOULD HAVE LIKED

346
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,040
TO HAVE SEEN YOU FINISH SCHOOL

347
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,242
AND GO TO COLLEGE.

348
00:09:02,242 --> 00:09:03,844
>> I KNOW.

349
00:09:03,844 --> 00:09:04,845
>> WELL, IT'S NOT ANYTHING

350
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:06,847
TO BE TAKEN LIGHTLY.

351
00:09:06,847 --> 00:09:08,015
>> WELL, NO, I'M DEFINITELY NOT

352
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:10,550
TAKING IT LIGHTLY AT ALL.

353
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,551
>> IT'S A MARRIAGE.

354
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:13,787
IT'S NOT A SCHOOL DANCE.

355
00:09:13,787 --> 00:09:15,723
>> I THINK WE'LL MAKE IT.

356
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:16,724
>> I HOPE YOU KNOW WHAT

357
00:09:16,724 --> 00:09:18,058
YOU'RE GETTING IN TO.

358
00:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,026
>> YEP.

359
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:20,460
>> OKAY.

360
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:21,795
>> GOOD?

361
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:22,930
>> I THINK SO.

362
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,765
OKAY, WHAT WAS THE THOUGHT

363
00:09:24,765 --> 00:09:26,934
PROCESS ON THESE SHOES?

364
00:09:26,934 --> 00:09:28,268
>> THEY WERE CUTE,

365
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:32,072
AND THEY MATCHED.

366
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:32,740
I JUST WANTED TO WEAR

367
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,374
SOMETHING CASUAL.

368
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:37,044
>> YOU NAILED IT.

369
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:38,378
I'M REALLY NOT TRYING TO GIVE

370
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:39,880
YOU A HARD TIME.

371
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,883
IT'S JUST, THIS IS A LITTLE BIT

372
00:09:42,883 --> 00:09:45,018
HARD TO SWALLOW, IS ALL.

373
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:48,656
>> THE DRESS OR...

374
00:09:48,656 --> 00:09:51,825
>> OH, HONEY, THIS WHOLE THING.

375
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:58,565
>> BE EXCITED FOR ME.

376
00:09:58,565 --> 00:09:59,466
>> OKAY.

377
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:00,300
>> MY AUNT WAS GOING TO COME

378
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,134
TO THE WEDDING.

379
00:10:01,134 --> 00:10:02,469
THEN SHE BACKED OUT AT THE LAST

380
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:04,204
MINUTE BECAUSE SHE HAD TO WORK

381
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:05,038
AS WELL.

382
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:05,873
BUT IT'S MY WEDDING DAY,

383
00:10:05,873 --> 00:10:06,707
AND I'M NOT GOING TO LET

384
00:10:06,707 --> 00:10:09,643
ANYTHING BRING ME DOWN.

385
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:10,644
COME ON, MEEMAW.

386
00:10:10,644 --> 00:10:12,646
AND LUCKILY, I CAN ALWAYS COUNT

387
00:10:12,646 --> 00:10:13,480
ON MY GRANDMA TO BE THERE

388
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,482
FOR ME.

389
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,122
>> OH, THESE SHOES.

390
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:24,792
OKAY, WHERE ARE WE...

391
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:25,793
>> WHERE ARE WE GONNA DO IT?

392
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:27,227
>> I DON'T KNOW.

393
00:10:27,227 --> 00:10:30,497
ARE YOU GUYS COMING?

394
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:31,331
>> HI, KIDS.

395

NICE TO MEET YOU.

399
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:35,235
>> I'M YOUR MINISTER FOR

400
00:10:35,235 --> 00:10:35,803
THE EVENING.

401
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:37,971
>> I THINK WE'RE GOOD TO GO.

402
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:40,473
>> WELL, WE'RE HERE ON THIS

403
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,976
BEAUTIFUL FALL AFTERNOON

404
00:10:42,976 --> 00:10:45,145
TO CELEBRATE BRANDON AND AUBREY

405
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,815
AS THEY ARE UNITED IN THE HOLY

406
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:49,549
BONDS OF MATRIMONY.

407
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:53,520
TRUE LOVE KNOWS NO LIMIT.

408
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,689
IN FACT, IT'S THE ONE THING,

409
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:56,924
WHEN EVERYTHING ELSE COMES

410
00:10:56,924 --> 00:10:58,759
CRASHING DOWN, LOVE WILL

411
00:10:58,759 --> 00:10:59,927
SURVIVE.

412
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:01,428
ARE YOU PREPARED TO TAKE

413
00:11:01,428 --> 00:11:02,529
YOUR VOWS?

414
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:03,196
>> YES.

415
00:11:03,196 --> 00:11:05,032

416
00:11:05,032 --> 00:11:07,735
TO BE YOUR LAWFULLY WEDDED WIFE

417
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:10,070
AND TO STAND BY HER IN TIMES

418
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,605
OF PROSPERITY OR EVEN POVERTY?

419
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:13,874
>> I DO.

420
00:11:13,874 --> 00:11:15,709

00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:19,579
HUSBAND, AND DO YOU PROMISE

423
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:21,749
TO LOVE HIM AND TO CHERISH HIM?

424
00:11:21,749 --> 00:11:23,751

MAN AND WIFE.

427
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:29,056
YOU MAY KISS THE BRIDE.

[applause]

429
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:32,559

00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,560
>> YOU ARE OFFICIALLY

431
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,563
MY HUSBAND.

432
00:11:36,563 --> 00:11:37,731
NOW THAT WE'RE MARRIED,

433
00:11:37,731 --> 00:11:39,733
WE'RE READY TO START OUR FAMILY,

434
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:40,901
BUT WE STILL HAVE A LOT

435
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:42,169
TO FIGURE OUT.

436
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:43,570
>> YOU HANG ON TO HER, BRANDON,

437
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:44,905
WITH THOSE SHOES.

438
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:45,739
>> AH!

439
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:46,406
SEE?

440
00:11:46,406 --> 00:11:47,307
>> WELL, YOU PICKED THOSE SHOES,

441
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:48,141
NOT ME.

442
00:11:48,141 --> 00:11:50,143
>> [laughs]

[marker squeaking]

444
00:11:59,086 --> 00:11:59,920
>> BRANDON AND I HAVE BEEN

445
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,254
MARRIED FOR TWO WEEKS, AND WITH

446
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:03,456
THE BABY ONLY ONE MONTH AWAY,

447
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:04,557
IT'S BEEN HARD TO FOCUS

448
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,625
ON MY G.E.D., AND BRANDON

449
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,627
STILL HASN'T FOUND WORK.

450
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:09,029
WE CAN'T PAY OUR BILLS,

451
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:11,098
LET ALONE FIND OUR OWN PLACE,

452
00:12:11,098 --> 00:12:12,399
AND MY MOM IS REALLY WORRIED.

453
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,233
>> BRANDON, THIS IS REAL

454
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,067
SERIOUS.

455
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,568
YOU NEED TO HAVE A STEADY JOB.

456
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,469
>> MM-HMM.

457
00:12:16,469 --> 00:12:17,470
>> YOU KNOW, DO SOMETHING TO

458
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:19,639
TAKE CARE OF AUSTIN AND AUBREY.

459
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,641
>> YEP.

460
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:27,047
>> I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WOULD

461
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:28,715
BE OKAY, BUT NOTHING IS WORKING

462
00:12:28,715 --> 00:12:30,383
OUT LIKE I EXPECTED, AND

463
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,385
EVERYONE IS GETTING ON OUR CASE.

464
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:34,554
>> SO WHAT'S THE PLAN?

465
00:12:34,554 --> 00:12:35,555
>> WELL, WE WERE PLANNING ON--

466
00:12:35,555 --> 00:12:37,724
IF BRANDON COULD GET A STEADY

467
00:12:37,724 --> 00:12:39,226
JOB--RENTING A HOUSE.

468
00:12:39,226 --> 00:12:43,063
>> SO LET'S SEE HERE.

469
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:44,064
YOU DON'T HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE.

470
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:46,834
YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB.

471
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:49,436
NOT LOOKING REAL GOOD, IS IT?

472
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:50,437
>> I'VE BEEN APPLYING, YOU KNOW,

473
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:51,771
FOR ANYTHING, JANITOR, ANYTHING.

474
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:52,605
IT'S KIND OF HARD.

475
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,074
I DON'T HAVE ANY COLLEGE OR...

476
00:12:54,074 --> 00:12:56,209
I HAVE SOME VOCATIONAL SCHOOL

477
00:12:56,209 --> 00:12:57,878
AND SOME TRADE SCHOOL STUFF

478
00:12:57,878 --> 00:12:58,545
BUT...

479
00:12:58,545 --> 00:12:59,379
>> WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOUR

480
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:00,080
G.E.D.?

481
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,915
>> THE TEST ISN'T FOR A MONTH.

482
00:13:01,915 --> 00:13:02,916
>> WELL, YOU CAN STUDY.

483
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:03,716
YOU CAN SIT AND STUDY.

484
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,085
>> YEAH.

485

486
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:06,686
GET SOMETHING GOING.

487
00:13:06,686 --> 00:13:09,522
THOSE DIAPERS AREN'T CHEAP.

488
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:10,523
RIGHT NOW, IT'S, LIKE,

489
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:12,192
CRUNCH TIME.

490
00:13:12,192 --> 00:13:13,193
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIND

491
00:13:13,193 --> 00:13:16,229
SOMETHING, FOR SURE.

WE'RE NO CLOSER TO BEING ON

OUR OWN THAN WHEN WE MOVED IN

496
00:13:21,068 --> 00:13:22,069
TO GRANDMA'S.

497
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:22,903
SO BRANDON IS WORKING

498
00:13:22,903 --> 00:13:24,905
DOUBLE-TIME TO FIND WORK.

499
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:26,573

TO GET OUT OF THIS RUT.

530

MY FRIENDS KNEW I WASN'T FEELING

00:15:05,072 --> 00:15:06,173
OR YOU DON'T PASS?

565
00:15:06,173 --> 00:15:06,839
>> UM...

566
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:07,840
>> YOU GOT AUSTIN CARTER CRYING

567
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,841
IN THE BACKGROUND, AND BRANDON'S

568
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:11,011
AT WORK TILL 2:00 IN THE MORNING

569
00:15:11,011 --> 00:15:11,678
AND STUFF.

570
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:13,180
LIKE, DO YOU--LIKE, DO YOU HAVE

571
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,347
A PLAN, OR DO YOU KNOW WHAT

572
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:15,448
YOU WANT TO DO?

573
00:15:15,448 --> 00:15:16,616
>> I DON'T KNOW.

574
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:18,551
I THINK IT WILL BE...

575
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:19,386
>> IT'S GONNA BE HARD,

576
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:20,220
BUT IT'S GONNA...

577
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,121
>> WELL, YEAH, IT'S GONNA BE

578
00:15:21,121 --> 00:15:21,788
HARD, BUT I HAVE TO GO

579
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:24,024
TO SCHOOL.

580
00:15:24,024 --> 00:15:26,026
BUT ANYWAY...

581
00:15:26,026 --> 00:15:27,527
MY FRIENDS ARE RIGHT.

582
00:15:27,527 --> 00:15:28,528
I'M ALREADY HAVING A HARD TIME

583
00:15:28,528 --> 00:15:30,197
STUDYING FOR THE G.E.D.,

584
00:15:30,197 --> 00:15:31,364
AND IT'S ONLY GOING TO GET

585
00:15:31,364 --> 00:15:35,568
HARDER WHEN THE BABY GETS HERE.

586
00:15:35,568 --> 00:15:37,237
SEEING MY FRIENDS MADE ME

587
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:39,339
REALIZE I HAVE TO GET MOTIVATED

588
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:41,174
IF I EVER WANT TO GET MY G.E.D.

589
00:15:41,174 --> 00:15:42,675
BRANDON HAS THE DAY OFF, SO I

590
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,044
ASKED HIM TO TAKE ME TO THE

591
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:45,345
LIBRARY TO GET BOOKS.

592
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:46,846
BRANDON, COME ON.

593
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:47,514
BRANDON?

594
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,649
>> I--FINE, I'M COMING.

595
00:15:49,649 --> 00:15:50,650
>> YOU WANT TO LOOK OVER

596
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:52,252
MY G.E.D. BOOKS WITH ME?

597
00:15:52,252 --> 00:15:53,253
>> WELL, I'LL TRY AND HELP...

598
00:15:53,253 --> 00:15:55,088
I'LL TRY AND HELP AS BEST I CAN,

599
00:15:55,088 --> 00:15:56,089
HONEY.

600
00:15:56,089 --> 00:15:57,424
>> "BASIC ARITHMETIC."

601
00:15:57,424 --> 00:15:58,358
OKAY.

602
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:01,694
2,000 DIVIDED BY 4 IS 1,500.

603
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:03,763
>> 2,000 DIVIDED BY 4 IS 1,500?

604
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,765
>> I MEAN, IT'S NOT 1,500.

605
00:16:05,765 --> 00:16:07,134
IT'S, UM...

606
00:16:07,134 --> 00:16:09,469
2,000 DIVIDED BY 4 IS 500.

607
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,470
>> I WISH MY BANK ACCOUNT

608
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,304
WORKED LIKE THAT.

609
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,806
>> "SO IF ANGLE 'A' AND ANGLE

610
00:16:13,806 --> 00:16:15,808
'C' BOTH EQUAL 70 DEGREES, THEN

611
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:20,013
WHAT IS THE LENGTH OF SIDE A-B?"

612
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:21,014
>> I CAN SEE THE SMOKE

613
00:16:21,014 --> 00:16:22,282
ROLLING OUT.

614
00:16:22,282 --> 00:16:23,716
>> WHAT?

615
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:24,884
I'M NOT A COMPLETE IDIOT,

616
00:16:24,884 --> 00:16:27,220
BRANDON.

617
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,556
I DON'T THINK IT'S FUNNY.

618
00:16:29,556 --> 00:16:31,058
IT'S ANNOYING THAT INSTEAD OF

619
00:16:31,058 --> 00:16:32,392
HELPING ME, BRANDON'S JUST

620
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:35,228
MAKING JOKES.

621
00:16:35,228 --> 00:16:37,464
I'M SETTING UP A PRACTICE G.E.D.

622
00:16:37,464 --> 00:16:39,032
EXAM TO SEE WHERE I'M AT,

623
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:40,133
AND BRANDON'S GOING TO PICK ME

624
00:16:40,133 --> 00:16:45,038
UP AFTER HIS SHIFT.

625
00:16:45,038 --> 00:16:45,672
>> ALL DONE?

626
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:46,339
>> YEAH.

627
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,340
ALL FINISHED.

628
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:49,176
>> WONDERFUL.

629
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:49,842
ALL RIGHT, PLEASE,

630
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:51,511
HAVE A SEAT.

631
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,246
OKAY.

632
00:16:53,246 --> 00:16:54,247
>> I'M REALLY EXCITED TO GET

633
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:55,415
MY G.E.D. SO THAT I CAN GO

634
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:58,085
TO COLLEGE, 'CAUSE THAT'S MY--

635
00:16:58,085 --> 00:16:59,219
WHAT I'M EXCITED FOR

636
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,488
IN THE FUTURE, SO...

637
00:17:01,488 --> 00:17:03,056
>> UNFORTUNATELY, YOU FAILED

638
00:17:03,056 --> 00:17:04,824
THE MATH TEST.

639
00:17:04,824 --> 00:17:08,361
YOU GOT 39% CORRECT ON THAT ONE.

640
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:10,029
YOU NEEDED A MINIMUM OF 65%

641
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,498
TO PASS THAT.

642
00:17:11,498 --> 00:17:14,101
>> [sighs]

643
00:17:14,101 --> 00:17:16,269
I HAVEN'T BEEN IN SCHOOL

644
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:19,439
FOR SO LONG, AND IT HASN'T BEEN

645
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,608
MY MAIN FOCUS, BUT I'D LIKE

646
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:24,777
TO WORK ON MY MATHEMATICS.

647
00:17:24,777 --> 00:17:26,279
COST-WISE, HOW DOES THAT

648
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:27,647
USUALLY GO?

649
00:17:27,647 --> 00:17:29,015
>> THAT ONE-ON-ONE RATE

650
00:17:29,015 --> 00:17:32,119
WOULD BE $48 AN HOUR.

651
00:17:32,119 --> 00:17:34,621
>> 48...

652
00:17:34,621 --> 00:17:37,290
SO AROUND 1,500 BUCKS TO...

653
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:38,291
>> IF YOU REQUIRE THE FULL

654
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,025
AMOUNT OF TIME.

655
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:39,759
>> MM-HMM, THE FULL AMOUNT

656
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,861
OF TIME TO STUDY FOR, SO...

657
00:17:41,861 --> 00:17:42,929
>> YES.

658
00:17:42,929 --> 00:17:44,597
IS THAT GOING TO BE MANAGEABLE

659
00:17:44,597 --> 00:17:45,832
AT THIS TIME?

660
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:47,934
>> UM...

661
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:50,437
I DON'T KNOW.

662
00:17:50,437 --> 00:17:51,771
I THOUGHT GETTING MY G.E.D.

663
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:53,273
WOULD BE SIMPLE, BUT NOW

664
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:54,941
I REALIZE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN

665
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:56,443
EASIER IF I HAD JUST STAYED

666
00:17:56,443 --> 00:17:58,445
IN SCHOOL.

667
00:18:02,849 --> 00:18:04,016
>> I'M REALLY UPSET I DIDN'T

668
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:05,685
PASS THE PRACTICE TEST.

669
00:18:05,685 --> 00:18:06,686
HOW AM I GOING TO GET INTO

670
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:08,020
COLLEGE IF I CAN'T EVEN GET

671
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,389
MY G.E.D.?

672
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:11,391
[sighs]

673
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:12,225
I JUST--I'M REALLY ANNOYED.

674
00:18:12,225 --> 00:18:12,892
I'M SORRY.

675
00:18:12,892 --> 00:18:13,726
>> CAN'T YOU BE IN A BETTER

676
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:14,394
MOOD?

677
00:18:14,394 --> 00:18:15,662
>> WELL, I'M IN A VERY BAD MOOD.

678
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:17,164
>> WELL, CHANGE IT.

679
00:18:17,164 --> 00:18:17,997
>> HE SAID THAT HE THOUGHT

680
00:18:17,997 --> 00:18:19,166
I'D NEED, LIKE, 30 HOURS

681
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,667
OF TUTORING.

682
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:23,002
AND 30 HOURS OF TUTORING

683
00:18:23,002 --> 00:18:25,605
IS 1,500 BUCKS.

684
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:27,274
EH?

685
00:18:27,274 --> 00:18:29,008
>> THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.

686
00:18:29,008 --> 00:18:31,244
>> [sighs]

687
00:18:31,244 --> 00:18:32,245
AND TO MAKE THINGS WORSE,

688
00:18:32,245 --> 00:18:33,646
THE NEXT DAY, MY GRANDMA

689
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:34,914
SAT US DOWN.

690
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:36,416
>> WE NEED TO HAVE A TALK,

691
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:38,918
A REALISTIC TALK, ABOUT HOW LONG

692
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:41,087
YOU'RE GOING TO BE STAYING HERE.

693
00:18:41,087 --> 00:18:42,255
I THINK IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU KIDS

694
00:18:42,255 --> 00:18:44,257
FIND A PLACE.

695
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:46,259
>> AT THIS POINT, IT TAKES OUR

696
00:18:46,259 --> 00:18:47,260
WHOLE PAYCHECK JUST TO--

697
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:48,261
>> JUST TO PAY RENT,

698
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:51,097
IF WE WERE TO MOVE OUT.

699
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:51,931
>> THEN MAYBE YOU COULD SAVE

700
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:53,933
EVERY BIT THAT YOU CAN POSSIBLY

701
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:55,502
SAVE.

702
00:18:55,502 --> 00:18:56,503
I MEAN, WITHOUT GOING OUT

703
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:58,171
FOR DINNER AND, YOU KNOW,

704
00:18:58,171 --> 00:18:58,838
THIS AND THAT.

705
00:18:58,838 --> 00:18:59,572
>> WE HAVE TO WAIT TILL--

706
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:01,508
>> WE DON'T GO OUT, YOU KNOW?

707
00:19:01,508 --> 00:19:03,676
WE DON'T GO OUT TO EAT OFTEN.

708
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:06,846
WE DON'T GO SHOPPING OFTEN.

709
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:09,982
>> AUBREY...

710
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:10,983
YOU UNDERSTAND WHERE

711
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:12,485
I'M COMING FROM, DO YOU?

712
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,353
>> YEAH.

713
00:19:13,353 --> 00:19:14,687
>> MM-HMM, OF COURSE.

714
00:19:14,687 --> 00:19:16,323
>> DO YOU KIDS HAVE ANY MONEY

715
00:19:16,323 --> 00:19:17,724
SAVED RIGHT NOW?

716
00:19:17,724 --> 00:19:19,226
>> UH...

717
00:19:19,226 --> 00:19:20,227
>> NO.

718
00:19:20,227 --> 00:19:21,394
>> NOT REALLY.

719
00:19:21,394 --> 00:19:22,562
THE BANK ACCOUNT IS PRETTY MUCH

720
00:19:22,562 --> 00:19:23,696
EMPTY.

721
00:19:23,696 --> 00:19:25,432
>> FOR SOME REASON, WE CAN'T

722
00:19:25,432 --> 00:19:28,301
SEEM TO GET IT TOGETHER.

723
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:29,736
AND THE BILL COLLECTORS

724
00:19:29,736 --> 00:19:31,604
ARE STILL CALLING.

725
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:33,273
HOW MUCH DID YOU SAY THE AMOUNT

726
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:34,574
WAS THAT WAS OWED?

727
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:39,479
$329.92.

728
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:42,649
I WILL NOT BE PAYING THAT TODAY.

729
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:43,316
THANK YOU.

730
00:19:43,316 --> 00:19:45,151
HAVE A GREAT DAY.

731
00:19:45,151 --> 00:19:46,286
[phone clicks shut]

732
00:19:46,286 --> 00:19:50,022
[sighs]

733
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:54,527
DUMB [bleep] BILL COLLECTORS.

734
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:55,862
THE PLAN WAS THAT BRANDON WOULD

735
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:57,196
WORK WHILE I STAY HOME

736
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,698
WITH THE BABY, BUT NOW IT'S

737
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:00,032
OBVIOUS THAT WE WON'T HAVE

738
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,434
ENOUGH MONEY WITH ONLY BRANDON

739
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:02,435
WORKING.

740
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:03,202
I DO WANT TO GET A JOB,

741
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,771
FOR SURE.

742
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:06,773
>> I'D RATHER YOU NOT.

743
00:20:06,773 --> 00:20:08,608
>> WHY?

744
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:10,277
>> 'CAUSE IT WOULDN'T REALLY

745
00:20:10,277 --> 00:20:11,944
MAKE FINANCIAL SENSE, 'CAUSE,

746
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:13,112
LIKE, EVEN WITH EXPERIENCE

747
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:14,113
AT A JOB, I DON'T EVEN MAKE

748
00:20:14,113 --> 00:20:15,114
THAT MUCH MONEY.

749
00:20:15,114 --> 00:20:15,948
WITHOUT EXPERIENCE, WITHOUT

750
00:20:15,948 --> 00:20:17,183
A G.E.D. OR ANYTHING...

751
00:20:17,183 --> 00:20:18,518
>> YES, I'M 17.

752
00:20:18,518 --> 00:20:19,452
I'M SORRY THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN

753
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:20,520
WORKING MY WHOLE LIFE.

754
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:21,521
THAT DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T

755
00:20:21,521 --> 00:20:22,855
WANT TO.

756
00:20:22,855 --> 00:20:26,359
IT TAKES TWO INCOMES THIS DAY

757
00:20:26,359 --> 00:20:29,195
AND AGE TO HAVE A FAMILY,

758
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:30,363
FOR SURE.

759
00:20:30,363 --> 00:20:31,197
>> I WOULD MAKE ENOUGH TO TAKE

760
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:34,367

>> I WANT TO HAVE A LIFE TOO.

762
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:37,304
>> YOU CAN HAVE ONE.

763
00:20:37,304 --> 00:20:38,305
BEING A HOUSEWIFE ISN'T

764
00:20:38,305 --> 00:20:39,306
THAT BAD.

765
00:20:39,306 --> 00:20:40,907
LOTS OF WOMEN LOVE IT.

766
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,742
>> I'M NOT GOING, YOU KNOW,

767
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,411
TO BE JUST, LIKE, A TYPICAL

768
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:47,547

769
00:20:47,547 --> 00:20:48,415

770
00:20:48,415 --> 00:20:49,181
>> WELL, YOU'RE BETTER

771
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:49,716
AT COOKING.

772
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:50,550
YOU'RE MORE EFFICIENT

773
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:51,584

IN THIS DAY AND AGE,

777
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,423
IT'S DEGRADING TOWARDS A WOMAN.

778
00:20:56,423 --> 00:20:57,089
LIKE...

779
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,090
>> OH, BROTHER.

THAN I AM, AND YOU KNOW IT.

783
00:21:01,428 --> 00:21:02,329
WHETHER IT'S YOU'RE A WOMAN

784
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:03,563
OR NOT, I DON'T KNOW, BUT...

785
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:04,564
>> THAT'S NOT GONNA BE MY GOAL

786
00:21:04,564 --> 00:21:09,569
IN LIFE, OKAY?

787
00:21:09,569 --> 00:21:10,437
>> WE'LL SEE.

788
00:21:10,437 --> 00:21:11,270
>> I'M GONNA BE WORKING

789
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,606
NO MATTER WHAT, PERIOD, AMEN,

790
00:21:13,606 --> 00:21:16,108
END OF STORY.

791
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:17,276
I CAN'T BELIEVE BRANDON EXPECTS

792
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,278
ME TO BE A HOUSEWIFE.

793
00:21:19,278 --> 00:21:20,279
MAYBE WE SHOULD HAVE DISCUSSED

794
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,614
THIS A LITTLE MORE BEFORE

795
00:21:21,614 --> 00:21:23,783
WE GOT MARRIED.

796
00:21:27,854 --> 00:21:29,188
HI-LO.

797
00:21:29,188 --> 00:21:30,022
>> HEY.

798

>> HOW ARE YOU?

799
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:31,624
>> GOOD.

800
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:32,291
HOW ARE YOU?

801
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:33,526
>> OH...

802
00:21:33,526 --> 00:21:35,194
I DON'T KNOW.

803
00:21:35,194 --> 00:21:37,530
IF WE REALLY REALISTICALLY WANT

804
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,865
TO BE OUT OF MEEMAW'S HOUSE

805
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:40,099
AND WANT TO GET OUR OWN PLACE,

806
00:21:40,099 --> 00:21:42,101
BRANDON DOES NOT MAKE ENOUGH.

807

TO SIT AT HOME ALL DAY DOING

822

00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:09,141
WE'RE GONNA MEET THIS

937
00:25:09,141 --> 00:25:11,978
LITTLE GUY.

938
00:25:11,978 --> 00:25:13,646
>> IT'S, LIKE, NEVER ENDING.

939
00:25:13,646 --> 00:25:15,147
I'M FINALLY STARTING TO FEEL

940
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:16,649
MY CONTRACTIONS, BUT I CAN'T

941
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:18,985
BELIEVE THIS IS TAKING SO LONG.

942
00:25:18,985 --> 00:25:20,486
BRANDON IS REALLY STARTING

943
00:25:20,486 --> 00:25:21,487
TO ANNOY ME.

944
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:22,321
>> IT'S ALL GOOD, HON.

945
00:25:22,321 --> 00:25:22,989
WE CAN DO THIS.

946
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:23,823
>> THERE'S NO [bleep] "WE"

947
00:25:23,823 --> 00:25:25,124
ABOUT IT.

948
00:25:25,124 --> 00:25:26,959
[sighs]

949
00:25:26,959 --> 00:25:28,460
YOU'RE NOT DOING ANYTHING.

950
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:33,299
YOU'RE SITTING IN A CHAIR.

951
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:34,634
[moans]

952
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:36,636
>> [exhales]

953
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:40,539
>> HOW COME THEY'RE NOT REALLY

954
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:41,608
CEASING?

955
00:25:41,608 --> 00:25:42,408
>> I CAN GO AHEAD AND GET YOU

956
00:25:42,408 --> 00:25:45,244
SOME PAIN MEDICINE.

957
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,549
>> I'M HAVING ONE RIGHT NOW.

958
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,217
>> I KNOW.

959
00:25:51,217 --> 00:25:53,219
I'M GIVING IT TO YOU.

960
00:26:00,627 --> 00:26:01,560
>> I'VE BEEN IN LABOR FOR

961
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:03,362
NEARLY A FULL DAY, AND I'M ONLY

962
00:26:03,362 --> 00:26:05,131
4 CENTIMETERS DILATED.

963
00:26:05,131 --> 00:26:06,899
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS

964
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:08,901
TO BE OVER.

965
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:15,241
>> JUST BREATHE, HONEY.

966
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:16,408
>> MY CONTRACTIONS ARE KILLING

967
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,077
ME, AND I JUST CAN'T TAKE IT

968
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:21,413
ANYMORE.

969
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:24,050
SO I'M GOING TO GET AN EPIDURAL.

970
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,387
FINALLY, THINGS STARTED

971
00:26:28,387 --> 00:26:29,789
HAPPENING, AND MY DOCTOR SAID

972
00:26:29,789 --> 00:26:31,390
IT WAS TIME TO PUSH.

973
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,792
>> OKAY, HE'S HERE.

974
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:33,592
>> YOU OKAY?

975
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:34,593
>> YEAH.

976
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:35,594
>> PUSH, PUSH, THAT'S IT.

977
00:26:35,594 --> 00:26:36,262
>> HARDER.

978
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:36,929
>> GO, GO, GO.

979
00:26:36,929 --> 00:26:38,430
>> TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE,

980
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:44,103
SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, TEN.

981
00:26:44,103 --> 00:26:45,271
YEAH.

982
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:46,338
>> [exhales]

983
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:47,339
>> PUSH HARDER.

984
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:50,843
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE,

985
00:26:50,843 --> 00:26:55,014
SIX, SEVEN, EIGHT, NINE, TEN.

986
00:26:55,014 --> 00:26:56,148
EXCELLENT.

987
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:56,816
>> HERE WE GO, HONEY.

988
00:26:56,816 --> 00:26:58,217
THE LAST ONE.

989
00:26:58,217 --> 00:26:59,118
>> YEAH, PUSH LIKE THAT, AUBREY.

990
00:26:59,118 --> 00:26:59,952
KEEP GOING.

991
00:26:59,952 --> 00:27:00,953
KEEP GOING. KEEP GOING.

992
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:01,821
>> THAT'S IT.

993
00:27:01,821 --> 00:27:02,421
>> NINE, TEN.

994
00:27:02,421 --> 00:27:03,089
>> GOOD, RIGHT BACK.

995
00:27:03,089 --> 00:27:04,290
DO THE SAME THING AGAIN.

996
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,457
HE'S COMING OUT.

997
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:07,827
>> AFTER 30 HOURS OF LABOR...

998
00:27:07,827 --> 00:27:08,427
>> HERE HE COMES.

999
00:27:08,427 --> 00:27:09,261
>> HERE HE COMES.

1000
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:11,097
OOH!

1001
00:27:11,097 --> 00:27:12,765
SEE, THERE'S YOUR BABY.

1002
00:27:12,765 --> 00:27:13,766
>> NICE.

1003
00:27:13,766 --> 00:27:14,566
>> THERE HE IS.

1004
00:27:14,566 --> 00:27:15,401
>> NICE!

1005
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:16,402
>> HE'S REACHING FOR YOU.

1006
00:27:16,402 --> 00:27:18,070
DO YOU WANT TO SEE HIM?

1007
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:19,906
THERE YOU GO.

1008
00:27:19,906 --> 00:27:20,907
>> NICE.

1009
00:27:20,907 --> 00:27:21,774
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER THAT

1010
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:22,909
HE'S A LITTLE GOOPY, DOES IT?

1011
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:24,410
>> NO.

1012
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:25,244
>> THERE YOU GO.

1013
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:26,245
>> HE'S PINKING UP, WHICH MEANS

1014
00:27:26,245 --> 00:27:27,246
HE'S BREATHING.

1015
00:27:27,246 --> 00:27:28,781
>> 13, 15...

1016
00:27:28,781 --> 00:27:29,949
>> A LITTLE MORE.

1017
00:27:29,949 --> 00:27:31,951
>> IT'S OKAY.

1018
00:27:34,787 --> 00:27:35,454
>> NICE.

1019
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:36,622
>> WHAT TIME WAS IT OVER?

1020
00:27:36,622 --> 00:27:37,957
>> 15:35.

1021
00:27:37,957 --> 00:27:39,625
>> OKAY.

1022
00:27:39,625 --> 00:27:40,326
>> GIVE HIM RIGHT BACK.

1023
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:41,160
>> I WANT DADDY TO BE ABLE

1024
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:41,828
TO HOLD HIM.

1025
00:27:41,828 --> 00:27:44,363
>> OKAY.

1026
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:47,800
>> HE'S SO HANDSOME.

1027
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,736
[chime dings]

1028
00:27:54,106 --> 00:27:55,942
IT'S SO CRAZY TO SEE HIM, LIKE,

1029
00:27:55,942 --> 00:27:57,443
ACTUALLY IN PERSON AND NOT ON

1030
00:27:57,443 --> 00:27:59,278
THE ULTRASOUND.

1031
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:00,279
COME IN!

1032
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,948
MY MOM AND MEEMAW WEREN'T THERE

1033
00:28:01,948 --> 00:28:03,916
FOR THE LABOR, BUT AFTER

1034
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:04,917
AUSTIN CARTER WAS BORN,

1035
00:28:04,917 --> 00:28:06,152
THEY CAME TO VISIT ME.

1036
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:08,154
>> HE'S SO HANDSOME, AUBREY.

1037
00:28:08,154 --> 00:28:09,321
>> THANK YOU.

>> GOOD JOB, SWEETIE.

1040
00:28:12,925 --> 00:28:15,494
>> THANK YOU.

1041
00:28:15,494 --> 00:28:16,495
AND MY FRIENDS SHOWED UP

1042
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:17,864
FOR HIS FIRST BATH.

1043
00:28:17,864 --> 00:28:19,866
>> AUSTIN'S FIRST BATH.

1044
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,535
>> I AM TIRED, BUT...

1045
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:32,044
>> EVERYONE LEFT, AND I WAS

1046
00:28:32,044 --> 00:28:33,880
EXHAUSTED, BUT IT WAS TIME

1047
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,647
TO LEARN HOW TO BREAST-FEED.

1048
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,149
>> GOOD FIRST TIME.

1049
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:38,484
I'M GONNA WATCH FOR THE LATCH.

1050
00:28:38,484 --> 00:28:39,651
THE LATCH IS THE MOST IMPORTANT

1051
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:40,486
THING.

1052
00:28:40,486 --> 00:28:42,822
HIS MOUTH IS OPEN PRETTY WIDE.

1053
00:28:42,822 --> 00:28:43,655
DOES IT HURT?

1054
00:28:43,655 --> 00:28:44,490
>> NO.

1055
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,157
>> THAT'S GOOD.

1056
00:28:45,157 --> 00:28:46,458
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.

1057
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:47,626
THAT'S PERFECT.

1058
00:28:47,626 --> 00:28:50,529
THAT IS JUST PERFECT.

1059
00:28:52,564 --> 00:28:53,232
>> READY TO GO HOME,

[baby coos]

1062
00:28:56,903 --> 00:28:58,237
>> AND BEFORE WE KNEW IT, IT

1063
00:28:58,237 --> 00:29:02,441
WAS TIME TO TAKE OUR BABY HOME.

1064
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:03,843
[sighs]

1065
00:29:03,843 --> 00:29:05,845
CAN YOU BELIEVE WE HAVE A BABY?

1066
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:08,747
>> MM-HMM.

1067
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:09,916
>> WE HAD REALLY HOPED TO HAVE

1068
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:11,818
OUR OWN PLACE BY NOW, BUT WE

1069
00:29:11,818 --> 00:29:13,820
JUST COULDN'T SAVE ENOUGH MONEY.

1070
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,821
>> LITTLE BUDDY, YOU'RE HOME.

1071
00:29:14,821 --> 00:29:16,455
>> WANT TO SHOW HIM TO MEEMAW?

1072
00:29:16,455 --> 00:29:18,457
YOU WANT TO HOLD HIM?

1073
00:29:18,457 --> 00:29:19,625
>> ALL RIGHT.

1074
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:20,459
OH, MY GOODNESS.

>> YOU LIKE MEEMAW.

1078
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:27,033
>> HE DOESN'T LIKE ME.

1079
00:29:27,033 --> 00:29:28,034
>> NO, HE'S COLD,

1080
00:29:28,034 --> 00:29:29,135
AND HE'S HUNGRY.

1081
00:29:29,135 --> 00:29:29,969
>> HOW COME HIS LITTLE CHEEK

1082
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:30,636
IS RED?

1083
00:29:30,636 --> 00:29:31,303
HE'S GOT...

>> IT'S JUST NEWBORN RASH.

1085
00:29:32,471 --> 00:29:33,305
YOU ALSO HAVE TO REMEMBER,

1086
00:29:33,305 --> 00:29:34,473
THOUGH, HE'S NOT CRYING

1087
00:29:34,473 --> 00:29:35,207
RIGHT NOW.

1088
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:36,042
>> WELL, THAT'S TRUE.

1089
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:39,011
JUST WAKING ME UP OR ANNOYING ME

1090
00:29:39,011 --> 00:29:39,846
OR ANYTHING.

1091
00:29:39,846 --> 00:29:40,646
>> HE DOESN'T CRY, THOUGH.

1092
00:29:40,646 --> 00:29:41,380
>> HE REALLY DOESN'T.

1093
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,381
YEAH, HE WHIMPERS.

1094
00:29:42,381 --> 00:29:43,850
>> HONEY, ALL THAT COULD CHANGE.

>> I'M SCARED TO DEATH OF THEM.

1098

>> I'M VERY GRATEFUL GRANDMA'S

1099
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:50,222
STILL LETTING US LIVE WITH HER,

1100
00:29:50,222 --> 00:29:51,390
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE WE'RE GONNA

1101
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,993
HAVE TO FIND OUR OWN PLACE FAST.

1102
00:30:01,567 --> 00:30:02,969
>> EVEN THOUGH GRANDMA WANTS US

1103
00:30:02,969 --> 00:30:04,470
TO GET OUR OWN PLACE,

1104
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,471
SHE'S BEING PATIENT FOR

1105
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:06,305
RIGHT NOW.

1106
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:06,973
ALL RIGHT, MEEMAW.

1107
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:07,974
SORRY I LEFT THAT IN THERE.

1108
00:30:07,974 --> 00:30:10,209
I GOT IT ALL TAKEN CARE OF.

1109
00:30:10,209 --> 00:30:12,378
BRANDON'S BEEN HELPING A LOT.

1110
00:30:12,378 --> 00:30:13,545
>> YOU'RE REALLY ALL RIGHT.

1111
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:14,847
DON'T SCRATCH YOURSELF.

1112
00:30:14,847 --> 00:30:16,615
>> BUT AFTER TAKING FIVE DAYS

1113
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:21,020
OFF, HE HAS TO GO BACK TO WORK.

1114
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:21,854
I'M GLAD YOU DON'T WORK

1115
00:30:21,854 --> 00:30:23,455
A LONG SHIFT TODAY.

1116
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:24,790
>> HEY, BABY BOY.

1117
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:25,958
>> IT MAKES ME HAPPY,

1118
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:28,294
AT LEAST, YOU KNOW?

1119
00:30:28,294 --> 00:30:29,195
>> ME TOO.

1120
00:30:29,195 --> 00:30:30,296
>> THE TIME WE DO HAVE TO SPEND

1121
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:32,965
APART ISN'T VERY LONG.

1122
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:33,966
LOVE YOU.

1123
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:34,967
>> LOVE YOU TOO, HON.

1124
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:35,801
>> I'LL SEE YOU WHEN YOU

1125
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:38,037
GET HOME.

1126
00:30:38,037 --> 00:30:39,038
>> I CAN'T FIND THE CAR KEYS

1127
00:30:39,038 --> 00:30:39,738
ANYWHERE.

1128
00:30:39,738 --> 00:30:40,439
>> DO YOU WANT ME TO GET

1129
00:30:40,439 --> 00:30:41,573
THE EMERGENCY ONES?

1130
00:30:41,573 --> 00:30:42,408
>> WELL, DO YOU HAVE THEM?

1131
00:30:42,408 --> 00:30:43,342
>> YEAH.

1132
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:44,176
GOD, DON'T LOSE THOSE,

1133
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:45,477
WHATEVER YOU DO.

1134
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:46,145
>> YEAH.

1135
00:30:46,145 --> 00:30:47,013
HONEY, WHEN YOU'RE CLEANING UP

1136
00:30:47,013 --> 00:30:48,280
THE ROOM, LOOK FOR THEM TODAY.

1137
00:30:48,280 --> 00:30:49,781
>> WHEN I'M CLEANING UP

1138
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:52,651
THE ROOM?

1139
00:30:52,651 --> 00:30:54,153
I LIKE HOW YOU ASSUME I'M JUST

1140
00:30:54,153 --> 00:30:56,755
GONNA CLEAN THE ROOM.

1141
00:31:00,826 --> 00:31:02,995
BEING A MOM CAN BE PHYSICALLY

1142
00:31:02,995 --> 00:31:04,663
AND MENTALLY EXHAUSTING.

1143
00:31:04,663 --> 00:31:06,665
LITTLE BOY, HOW DID YOU JUST

1144
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:07,499
DO THAT?

1145
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:09,668
HE JUST PEED ALL OVER ME

1146
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:10,903
AND HIM.

1147
00:31:10,903 --> 00:31:12,204
[baby crying]

1148
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,039
IT'S OKAY.

1149
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,706
IT'S FINE.

1150
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:15,707
GONNA GIVE YOU A BOTTLE

1151
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:16,976
IN A SECOND.

1152
00:31:16,976 --> 00:31:18,477
IT'S BEEN A MONTH SINCE I'VE

1153
00:31:18,477 --> 00:31:20,179
HAD AUSTIN, AND WITH BRANDON

1154
00:31:20,179 --> 00:31:21,647
BACK AT WORK, I'M GETTING

1155
00:31:21,647 --> 00:31:23,983
ALMOST NO SLEEP AND SPEND ALL MY

1156
00:31:23,983 --> 00:31:29,655
TIME TAKING CARE OF THE BABY...

1157
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:31,657
>> [fussing]

1158
00:31:31,657 --> 00:31:33,192
>> WHICH LEAVES NO TIME TO

1159
00:31:33,192 --> 00:31:36,495
STUDY FOR MY G.E.D.

1160
00:31:36,495 --> 00:31:39,031
I COULD REALLY USE SOME HELP.

1161
00:31:41,968 --> 00:31:42,969
BRANDON, DO YOU WANT TO HEAT

1162
00:31:42,969 --> 00:31:44,136
SOME WATER UP REAL QUICK?

1163
00:31:44,136 --> 00:31:45,837
HE REALLY SHOULD--HE'S GONNA BE

1164
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:46,838
STARVING HERE IN JUST A MINUTE,

1165
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:47,839
AND HE HASN'T EATEN IN, LIKE,

1166
00:31:47,839 --> 00:31:48,507
THREE HOURS.

1167
00:31:48,507 --> 00:31:49,375
>> ABSOLUTELY, I'M GONNA EAT

1168
00:31:49,375 --> 00:31:49,976
SOME CHIPS TOO.

1169
00:31:49,976 --> 00:31:50,809
OH, WAIT, I WANT AN ICE CREAM.

1170
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:51,810
SHOULD I GET CHIPS OR ICE CREAM?

1171
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:54,513
>> I DON'T CARE.

1172
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:55,681
JUST WORRY ABOUT YOUR SON

1173
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:56,682
RIGHT NOW.

1174
00:31:56,682 --> 00:31:57,616
THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

1175
00:31:57,616 --> 00:32:00,619
[baby crying]

1176
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:13,832
SERIOUSLY, PLEASE GET OUT.

1177
00:32:13,832 --> 00:32:15,934
PLEASE GET OUT.

1178
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:20,239
NO, BRANDON, SERIOUSLY, NO.

1179
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:21,073
>> WELL, LET ME TELL YOU,

1180
00:32:21,073 --> 00:32:22,074
YOU'RE DOING JUST FINE.

1181
00:32:22,074 --> 00:32:24,276
>> GREAT.

1182
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:25,277
>> BOO-BOO.

1183
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:26,178
>> NO.

1184
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:27,446
IT'S NOT OKAY.

1185
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:28,447
>> I'M NOT SAYING--

1186
00:32:28,447 --> 00:32:29,448
I'M SORRY.

1187
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:30,449
>> YOU KNOW I'M EXHAUSTED.

1188
00:32:30,449 --> 00:32:31,950
YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN EMOTIONAL

1189
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:33,285
ALL DAY TODAY, AND NOW YOU'RE

1190
00:32:33,285 --> 00:32:37,956
JUST MAKING IT WORSE.

1191
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,359
>> I LOVE YOU.

1192
00:32:40,359 --> 00:32:42,194
>> BRANDON DOESN'T UNDERSTAND

1193
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:43,362
WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH.

1194
00:32:43,362 --> 00:32:45,497
AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE,

1195
00:32:45,497 --> 00:32:46,665
GRANDMA WANTS US OUT.

1196
00:32:46,665 --> 00:32:47,833
>> I WANT MY HOUSE BACK.

1197
00:32:47,833 --> 00:32:49,168
IT'S TIME, YOU KNOW?

1198
00:32:49,168 --> 00:32:50,669
BEFORE WE REALLY START GETTING

1199
00:32:50,669 --> 00:32:51,670
ON EACH OTHER'S NERVES.

1200
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,338
>> MM-HMM.

1201
00:32:52,338 --> 00:32:53,505
>> I THINK WE'LL BE OUT OF YOUR

1202
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:55,474
HOUSE BY SUMMER.

1203
00:32:55,474 --> 00:32:56,475
>> HOW MUCH MONEY HAVE YOU GUYS

1204
00:32:56,475 --> 00:32:58,310
PUT ASIDE FOR MOVING?

1205
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,478
>> NOT AS MUCH AS WE'D LIKE TO.

1206
00:32:59,478 --> 00:33:00,479
>> YEAH, NOT AS MUCH AS WE'D

1207
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,813
LIKE TO.

1208
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,482
I HAVE 99 CENTS IN MY SAVINGS

1209
00:33:03,482 --> 00:33:05,151
ACCOUNT.

1210
00:33:05,151 --> 00:33:06,318
>> THIS SUMMER,

1211
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,487
WE'LL WAVE ADIOS.

1212
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:09,155
>> YEAH.

1213
00:33:09,155 --> 00:33:10,189
>> [laughs]

1214
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:11,190
>> SUMMER IS ONLY TWO MONTHS

1215
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,691
AWAY, AND IF WE'RE GOING TO GET

1216
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:14,193
A PLACE OF OUR OWN, I'M GOING TO

1217
00:33:14,193 --> 00:33:15,361
HAVE TO CONVINCE BRANDON THAT

1218
00:33:15,361 --> 00:33:17,229
I NEED TO GET A JOB TOO.

1219
00:33:17,229 --> 00:33:19,631
SO WE HAVE 18 BUCKS TO LAST US

1220
00:33:19,631 --> 00:33:21,400
NINE DAYS, AND WE STILL HAVE

1221
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,735
BILLS TO PAY.

1222
00:33:23,735 --> 00:33:24,736
I MEAN, IT'S NOT EVEN REALLY

1223
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:26,738
REALISTIC TO FRICKING GET OUR

1224
00:33:26,738 --> 00:33:28,074
OWN PLACE UNTIL ALL OF OUR BILLS

1225
00:33:28,074 --> 00:33:29,408
ARE PAID OFF.

1226
00:33:29,408 --> 00:33:30,909
>> I CAN GET ANOTHER PART-TIME

1227
00:33:30,909 --> 00:33:31,910
JOB, 'CAUSE ANYTHING WOULD HELP,

1228
00:33:31,910 --> 00:33:32,578
YOU KNOW?

1229
00:33:32,578 --> 00:33:33,279
>> WELL, I WANTED TO GET

1230
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,213
A PART-TIME JOB.

1231
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:35,381
>> YOU COULD GET A PART-TIME JOB

1232
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:36,215
MAKING MINIMUM WAGE.

1233
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:37,383
I COULD GET A PART-TIME JOB

1234
00:33:37,383 --> 00:33:39,185
MAKING $10, $11 AN HOUR.

1235
00:33:39,185 --> 00:33:40,486
>> WHY DO YOU ONLY GET TO BE

1236
00:33:40,486 --> 00:33:41,953
OUT OF THE HOUSE?

1237
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:42,688
>> IT'S ABOUT FREAKING

1238
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:43,289
SURVIVING.

1239
00:33:43,289 --> 00:33:43,989
I COULD CARE LESS IF YOU

1240
00:33:43,989 --> 00:33:44,956
NEVER LEAVE THE HOUSE.

1241
00:33:44,956 --> 00:33:46,158
THAT'S NOT WHAT IT'S ABOUT.

1242
00:33:46,158 --> 00:33:47,025
IT'S ABOUT MAKING ENDS MEET.

1243
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:47,926
>> I'M GLAD YOU COULD CARE LESS

1244
00:33:47,926 --> 00:33:49,495
IF I NEVER LEAVE THE HOUSE.

1245
00:33:49,495 --> 00:33:51,330
I WANT TO CONTRIBUTE, YOU KNOW?

1246
00:33:51,330 --> 00:33:52,498
IT'S IMPORTANT TO ME.

1247
00:33:52,498 --> 00:33:53,665
>> I KNOW, HON, IT'S JUST,

1248
00:33:53,665 --> 00:33:54,833
TO ME, THE MOST PRACTICAL--

1249
00:33:54,833 --> 00:33:55,667
YOU ARE CONTRIBUTING.

1250
00:33:55,667 --> 00:33:56,535
THE MOST PRACTICAL WAY YOU'RE

1251
00:33:56,535 --> 00:33:57,669
CONTRIBUTING IS BY HELPING--

1252
00:33:57,669 --> 00:33:58,504
BEING WITH AUSTIN WHILE

1253
00:33:58,504 --> 00:33:59,171
I'M AT WORK.

1254
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:00,038
>> BUT YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

1255
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:00,839
I'M NEVER GONNA BE ABLE TO

1256
00:34:00,839 --> 00:34:01,740
HAVE A CAREER IF I DON'T START

1257
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:04,343
GETTING JOB EXPERIENCE.

1258
00:34:04,343 --> 00:34:05,844
IF WE'RE GONNA MAKE THIS FAMILY

1259
00:34:05,844 --> 00:34:07,012
WORK, THEN WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

1260
00:34:07,012 --> 00:34:09,081
DO IT AS A TEAM.

1261
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:26,365
>> YOU WANT TO GO TO BED?

1262
00:34:26,365 --> 00:34:28,200
BRANDON AND I STILL DON'T AGREE

1263
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:29,401
ON HOW WE'RE GOING TO COME UP

1264
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:30,902
WITH THE MONEY TO MOVE OUT,

1265
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:32,238
AND NOW HE'S COME UP WITH HIS

1266
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:34,540
OWN IDEA FOR MAKING EXTRA MONEY.

1267
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,208
>> THIS IS A COMPLETE KIT

1268
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:37,209
OF EVERYTHING YOU NEED

1269
00:34:37,209 --> 00:34:39,010
TO GET STARTED IN PROSPECTING.

1270
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,846
IT'S A PROFITABLE VENTURE.

1271
00:34:40,846 --> 00:34:41,513
>> MM-HMM.

1272
00:34:41,513 --> 00:34:42,348
>> IF YOU GO OUT THERE AND FIND

1273
00:34:42,348 --> 00:34:43,982
1/2 OUNCE OF GOLD, THAT'S $600.

1274
00:34:43,982 --> 00:34:46,385
THIS WILL MAKE YOU MONEY.

1275
00:34:46,385 --> 00:34:48,620
SALE.

1276
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,322
WELL, I APPRECIATE IT.

1277
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:51,523
GOOD LUCK TO YOU.

1278
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:52,924
>> THANK YOU.

1279
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,092
>> I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT

1280
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,594
BRANDON'S IDEA TO GET EXTRA

1281
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:57,529
MONEY IS SOLID, SO I'M COMING UP

1282
00:34:57,529 --> 00:34:58,797
WITH MY OWN PLAN.

1283
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:00,566
I DON'T WANT TO BE A FULL-TIME

1284
00:35:00,566 --> 00:35:02,534
STAY-AT-HOME MOM, SO I APPLIED

1285
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:03,602
FOR A JOB ONLINE, AND WHILE

1286
00:35:03,602 --> 00:35:05,571
BRANDON'S AT WORK, MY MOM'S

1287
00:35:05,571 --> 00:35:06,572
AGREED TO WATCH AUSTIN DURING

1288
00:35:06,572 --> 00:35:07,839
MY INTERVIEW.

1289
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,175
MAKE SURE TO BURP HIM AFTER

1290
00:35:09,175 --> 00:35:11,009
EVERY SINGLE FEEDING JUST UNTIL

1291
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:12,144
HE WILL BURP.

1292
00:35:12,144 --> 00:35:13,145
>> AUBREY, I THINK YOUR MOM

1293
00:35:13,145 --> 00:35:14,713
CAN HANDLE IT, SWEETIE.

1294
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:15,714
>> YOU KNOW, IT'S MY VERY FIRST

1295
00:35:15,714 --> 00:35:17,483
TIME LEAVING HIM.

1296
00:35:17,483 --> 00:35:19,785
>> BUT HE'S GONNA BE FINE.

1297
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:20,752
>> I'M HERE FOR AN INTERVIEW

1298
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:21,987

00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:23,989
>> AUBREY.

1302
00:35:23,989 --> 00:35:24,656
NICE TO MEET YOU.

1303
00:35:24,656 --> 00:35:25,324
>> PLEASE HAVE A SEAT

1304
00:35:25,324 --> 00:35:25,991
RIGHT OVER HERE.

1305
00:35:25,991 --> 00:35:27,326
SO WHAT QUALITIES DO YOU POSSESS

1306
00:35:27,326 --> 00:35:28,327
THAT WOULD MAKE YOU A REALLY

1307
00:35:28,327 --> 00:35:29,728
GOOD EMPLOYEE?

1308
00:35:29,728 --> 00:35:32,063
>> I KNOW THIS IS GONNA SOUND

1309
00:35:32,063 --> 00:35:34,233
CORNY, BUT I'M A GENUINE PERSON.

1310
00:35:34,233 --> 00:35:35,734
I REALLY--I REALLY ENJOY

1311
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:36,802
WORKING WITH PEOPLE.

1312
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:37,969
>> ALL RIGHT.

1313
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,806
HOW WOULD YOU HANDLE, LIKE,

1314
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:42,841
IF A CUSTOMER GOT UPSET?

1315
00:35:42,841 --> 00:35:43,842
I'M CALLING YOU RIGHT NOW.

1316
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:44,510
RING-RING.

1317
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:45,177
>> UH-HUH.

1318
00:35:45,177 --> 00:35:46,278
>> HI.

1319
00:35:46,278 --> 00:35:47,513
I JUST GOT MY PIZZA.

1320
00:35:47,513 --> 00:35:49,014
IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE SAUSAGE,

1321
00:35:49,014 --> 00:35:50,516
AND IT'S PEPPERONI.

1322
00:35:50,516 --> 00:35:53,519
>> OKAY, UM...

1323
00:36:00,326 --> 00:36:01,159
>> OKAY.

1324
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:01,827
>> SORRY.

1325
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:03,529
I'VE NEVER ANSWERED PHONE CALLS

1326
00:36:03,529 --> 00:36:04,162
BEFORE.

1327
00:36:04,162 --> 00:36:05,664
I'VE NEVER HAD THAT SITUATION

1328
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:06,565
HAPPEN.

1329
00:36:06,565 --> 00:36:10,236
>> OKAY.

1330
00:36:10,236 --> 00:36:11,570
>> SORRY ABOUT THAT.

1331
00:36:11,570 --> 00:36:13,071
>> THAT'S OKAY.

1332
00:36:13,071 --> 00:36:14,406
>> I'M REALLY GOOD WITH PEOPLE,

1333
00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:16,475
AND I, YOU KNOW, I JUST THINK

1334
00:36:16,475 --> 00:36:18,744
THAT I COULD DEFINITELY DO WELL.

1335
00:36:18,744 --> 00:36:19,745
I WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO COMING

1336
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:21,280
TO WORK EVERY DAY.

1337
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:21,947
[laughter]

1338
00:36:21,947 --> 00:36:23,148
I'LL TELL YOU THAT MUCH.

1339
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:23,815
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH

1340
00:36:23,815 --> 00:36:24,483
FOR COMING IN.

1341
00:36:24,483 --> 00:36:25,150
>> YES, THANK YOU.

1342
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:25,851
>> ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

1343
00:36:25,851 --> 00:36:26,518
I'LL BE IN TOUCH.

1344
00:36:26,518 --> 00:36:28,320
>> ALL RIGHT.

1345
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,321
I'M NOT SURE IF I'LL GET

1346
00:36:29,321 --> 00:36:30,822
THE JOB, BUT IT FELT GOOD

1347
00:36:30,822 --> 00:36:32,324
TAKING MATTERS INTO MY OWN

1348
00:36:32,324 --> 00:36:33,825
HANDS, AND AFTER PICKING UP

1349
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:35,327
AUSTIN, I WENT TO HANG OUT

1350
00:36:35,327 --> 00:36:36,328
WITH MY FRIENDS.

1351
00:36:36,328 --> 00:36:36,995
HI.

1352
00:36:36,995 --> 00:36:38,330
>> HI.

1353
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:40,499
OOH.

1354
00:36:40,499 --> 00:36:42,334
HE IS SO CUTE.

1355
00:36:42,334 --> 00:36:43,235
>> OKAY, I'M GONNA SET HIM DOWN

1356
00:36:43,235 --> 00:36:43,969
ON THE TABLE.

1357
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:44,636
HE'S HEAVY.

1358
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:45,804
>> HE'S GETTING SO BIG.

1359
00:36:45,804 --> 00:36:47,072
>> I KNOW.

1360
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:49,207
>> HOW'S SCHOOL GOING FOR YOU?

1361
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,710
>> WELL, IT'S DEFINITELY, LIKE,

1362
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:52,711
SINCE HE'S BEEN HOME, IT'S BEEN

1363
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,212
HARDER TO STUDY FOR MY G.E.D.

1364
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:55,381
FOR SURE.

1365
00:36:55,381 --> 00:36:57,048
BUT I HAD MY JOB INTERVIEW

1366
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:58,149
TODAY.

1367
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:00,519
>> SO ARE YOU GONNA TELL BRANDON

1368
00:37:00,519 --> 00:37:01,820
ABOUT IT, SEEING AS HOW HE HAS

1369
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,021
NO IDEA YET?

1370
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:05,624
>> I--YES, I AM.

1371
00:37:05,624 --> 00:37:06,625
ME AND BRANDON NEVER TALKED

1372
00:37:06,625 --> 00:37:07,793
ABOUT, LIKE, DAY CARE AND, LIKE,

1373
00:37:07,793 --> 00:37:08,794
WORK AND, LIKE, HOW THAT WOULD

1374
00:37:08,794 --> 00:37:09,795
ALL WORK, YOU KNOW?

1375
00:37:09,795 --> 00:37:10,962
YOU KNOW, I WANT TO BE ABLE TO

1376
00:37:10,962 --> 00:37:13,965
SAY THAT I CONTRIBUTED.

1377
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:15,467
[chime dings]

1378
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:16,802
ON MY WAY HOME TO TALK TO

1379
00:37:16,802 --> 00:37:18,637
BRANDON, THE PIZZA PLACE CALLED,

1380
00:37:18,637 --> 00:37:20,739
AND I GOT THE JOB.

1381
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:24,910
UM, SO I APPLIED FOR A JOB

1382
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:29,247
ONLINE, AND I WENT TO

1383
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:30,516
MY INTERVIEW.

1384
00:37:30,516 --> 00:37:32,017
>> WHAT KIND OF JOB WAS IT?

1385
00:37:32,017 --> 00:37:34,019
>> FOR A PIZZERIA POSITION.

1386
00:37:34,019 --> 00:37:35,020
>> MM.

1387
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:38,857
>> AND SO I GOT THE JOB.

1388
00:37:38,857 --> 00:37:40,559
>> HMM.

1389
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:41,760
>> YEAH.

1390
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,295
I THINK IT'S DEFINITELY A STEP

1391
00:37:43,295 --> 00:37:44,796
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR US

1392
00:37:44,796 --> 00:37:47,466
GETTING OUT OF MEEMAW'S HOUSE

1393
00:37:47,466 --> 00:37:49,968
AND MOVING IN TO OUR OWN PLACE,

1394
00:37:49,968 --> 00:37:51,470
AND, YOU KNOW, THE MORE MONEY

1395
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,004
WE CAN SAVE, THE BETTER.

1396
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:53,839
>> YEAH, INITIALLY, I DON'T

1397
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:54,706
KNOW, I WASN'T REALLY UP FOR

1398
00:37:54,706 --> 00:37:56,007
THE IDEA OF BOTH OF US WORKING,

1399
00:37:56,007 --> 00:37:57,175
'CAUSE I FIGURED ONE OF US

1400
00:37:57,175 --> 00:37:58,009
WOULD HAVE TO BE HOME WITH

1401
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:00,178
THE BABY ALL THE TIME, AND IF

1402
00:38:00,178 --> 00:38:01,347
WE CAN WORK IT AROUND, YOU KNOW,

1403
00:38:01,347 --> 00:38:02,848
MY WORK SCHEDULE AND YOUR WORK

1404
00:38:02,848 --> 00:38:04,350
SCHEDULE, IF WE CAN WORK IT

1405
00:38:04,350 --> 00:38:05,216
AROUND RIGHT, WHERE WE DON'T

1406
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:06,184
HAVE TO PUT THE BABY IN DAY CARE

1407
00:38:06,184 --> 00:38:08,086
ALL THE TIME, THEN THAT

1408
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:10,756
WOULD BE GOOD.

1409
00:38:13,392 --> 00:38:14,726
>> I'M GLAD BRANDON IS BEING

1410
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:16,027
OPEN-MINDED ABOUT ME GETTING

1411
00:38:16,027 --> 00:38:18,029
A JOB.

1412
00:38:23,335 --> 00:38:24,336
>> AND SINCE WE CAN'T AFFORD

1413
00:38:24,336 --> 00:38:26,171
DAY CARE, HE WATCHES THE BABY

1414
00:38:26,171 --> 00:38:28,073
WHILE I GO TO WORK.

1415
00:38:28,073 --> 00:38:29,040
I'LL GET BETTER AT IT.

1416
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,376
MY JOB MAY NOT BE ROCKET

1417
00:38:30,376 --> 00:38:32,210
SCIENCE, BUT I'M HAPPY I CAN

1418
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,379
CONTRIBUTE TO OUR FAMILY.

1419
00:38:33,379 --> 00:38:34,980
THERE'S MY BABIES.

1420
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,647
HI, HONEYS.

1421
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:36,314
>> HOW WAS WORK?

1422
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:37,816
>> IT WAS GOOD.

1423
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:40,251
BRANDON AND I BOTH HAVE THE DAY

1424
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:41,252
OFF, BUT WE'RE SPENDING IT

1425
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:43,088
TRYING TO MAKE SOME EXTRA MONEY

1426
00:38:43,088 --> 00:38:43,789
GOLD PANNING.

1427
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:44,790
I DON'T THINK YOU GOT ME

1428
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:46,458
ANY DIRT AT ALL.

1429
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:48,960
IT'S ALL ROCKS.

1430
00:38:56,402 --> 00:38:58,236
DO YOU THINK THAT AUSTIN BEING

1431
00:38:58,236 --> 00:38:59,905
HERE HAS MESSED WITH OUR

1432
00:38:59,905 --> 00:39:01,407
RELATIONSHIP A LITTLE BIT?

1433
00:39:01,407 --> 00:39:02,073
>> YEAH.

1434
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:03,074
OBVIOUSLY, IT'S CHANGED IT.

1435
00:39:03,074 --> 00:39:03,909
THE DYNAMICS HAVE CHANGED

1436
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:05,310
OF OUR RELATIONSHIP, BUT...

1437
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:06,478
>> IT'LL BE NICE WHEN WE DON'T

1438
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:08,146
HAVE TO RELY ON EVERYBODY FOR

1439
00:39:08,146 --> 00:39:09,715
EVERYTHING, YOU KNOW?

1440
00:39:09,715 --> 00:39:10,582
>> YEAH.

1441
00:39:10,582 --> 00:39:11,983
>> I DEFINITELY THOUGHT WE'D BE

1442
00:39:11,983 --> 00:39:13,318
OUT OF MEEMAW'S HOUSE BY NOW.

1443
00:39:13,318 --> 00:39:14,653
>> YEAH, WE'RE TRYING.

1444
00:39:14,653 --> 00:39:15,654
SHE KNOWS THAT, YOU KNOW?

1445
00:39:15,654 --> 00:39:17,322
>> EXACTLY.

1446
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:18,524
>> I'M PRETTY PSYCHED THAT

1447
00:39:18,524 --> 00:39:19,391
YOU GOT A JOB.

1448
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:20,225
>> YEAH?

1449
00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:21,393
>> YOU KNOW, LIKE, AT FIRST,

1450
00:39:21,393 --> 00:39:22,293
I WAS WORRIED BECAUSE I DIDN'T

1451
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:22,994
KNOW WHO WAS GONNA WATCH

1452
00:39:22,994 --> 00:39:24,596
THE BABY, BUT SINCE YOU GOT

1453
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:25,764
A WORK THAT'S REALLY FLEXIBLE

1454
00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:27,933
WITH MY WORK SCHEDULE, IT REALLY

1455
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:29,401
MAKES ME HAPPY, AND IT, LIKE...

1456
00:39:29,401 --> 00:39:30,569
>> SO YOU'RE ALL RIGHT WITH IT?

1457
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:31,403
>> MM-HMM.

1458
00:39:31,403 --> 00:39:32,303
>> GOOD.

1459
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:33,672
HOW MUCH DO YOU GET FOR

1460
00:39:33,672 --> 00:39:35,541
AN OUNCE?

1461
00:39:35,541 --> 00:39:37,543
>> RIGHT NOW, IT'S $1,100.

1462
00:39:37,543 --> 00:39:38,343
>> OKAY, SO WE JUST NEED TO

1463
00:39:38,343 --> 00:39:40,579
FIND SOME BIG PIECES OF GOLD.

1464
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:47,252
WHEN I FIRST GOT PREGNANT,

1465
00:39:47,252 --> 00:39:49,921
I DEFINITELY DON'T THINK

1466
00:39:49,921 --> 00:39:51,222
WE WERE READY.

1467
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,724
SOMETIMES I JUST LOOK AT HIM

1468
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,392
AND I JUST THINK, LIKE,

1469
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,062
I CAN'T BELIEVE I DID THIS.

1470
00:39:57,062 --> 00:39:58,063
IT'S SO INSANE.

1471
00:39:58,063 --> 00:39:59,230
IT'S SO CRAZY.

1472
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,899
HI, HONEY.

1473
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:01,900
OOH.

1474
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,234
OOH.

1475
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,335
HEY.

1476
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:06,037
WAY TO PEE IN THE BATH.

1477
00:40:06,037 --> 00:40:08,139
THAT WASN'T COOL.

1478
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:09,307
I THINK FROM WHEN ME AND BRANDON

1479
00:40:09,307 --> 00:40:10,942
FIRST GOT PREGNANT, OUR

1480
00:40:10,942 --> 00:40:12,110
RELATIONSHIP HAS STRENGTHENED

1481
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:13,445
A LOT.

1482
00:40:13,445 --> 00:40:16,281
BRANDON HAS REALLY LIGHTENED UP

1483
00:40:16,281 --> 00:40:18,517
ON THE IDEA OF ME HAVING A JOB.

HE REALIZES THAT I NEED TIME

1485
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,320
AWAY FROM THE HOUSE.

1486
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,321
HOW'S SCHOOL GOING?

1487
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:25,156
>> IT'S GOING GOOD.

1488
00:40:25,156 --> 00:40:26,658
>> I REALLY WISH THAT I HAD

1489
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:28,660
GOTTEN MY G.E.D. BEFORE I HAD

1490
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:29,661
AUSTIN.

1491
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:30,662
I'VE BEEN WORKING HARD,

1492
00:40:30,662 --> 00:40:31,997
AND I'LL GET MY G.E.D.

1493
00:40:31,997 --> 00:40:33,699
'CAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT TO ME.

1494
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:34,866
I WANT TO GO TO COLLEGE

1495
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:35,967
AND HAVE A CAREER, BECAUSE

1496
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:38,136
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO OFFER

1497
00:40:38,136 --> 00:40:39,370
EVERYTHING TO HIM.

1498
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:40,539
HERE, LET'S GET THESE LITTLE

1499
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:42,073
KNEES UP.

1500
00:40:42,073 --> 00:40:43,241
I THOUGHT WE WOULD HAVE MONEY

1501
00:40:43,241 --> 00:40:45,110
IN SAVINGS BY NOW.

1502
00:40:45,110 --> 00:40:46,545
I DO WISH THAT WE WERE

1503
00:40:46,545 --> 00:40:48,480

00:41:06,832 --> 00:41:07,633
PREGNANT, AND I DON'T WANT

1508
00:41:07,633 --> 00:41:09,968
TO BE.

1509
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:10,702
>> YOU HAD A SCHOLARSHIP

1510
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:11,469
TO COLLEGE.

1511
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,571
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO BE HERE.

1512
00:41:12,571 --> 00:41:13,839
AND NOT ONLY ARE YOU HERE;

1513
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,707

1515
00:41:17,275 --> 00:41:19,144
EVERYBODY HAS A PURPOSE IN LIFE.

1516
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:20,045
I DIDN'T THINK MY PURPOSE

1517
00:41:20,045 --> 00:41:21,479
WAS TO TAKE CARE OF A BABY.

1518
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:22,814
>> IF I JUST WALK AWAY,

1519
00:41:22,814 --> 00:41:23,949
WHAT WAS THE PURPOSE

1520
00:41:23,949 --> 00:41:24,950
OF STAYING HERE, THEN?

1521
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:25,817
>> THERE'S NO POSSIBLE WAY

1522
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:27,318
IT COULD BE ANYBODY ELSE'S BABY.

1523
00:41:27,318 --> 00:41:28,119
>> I FEEL WE SHOULD HAVE

1524
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:29,020
A DNA TEST.

1525
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:29,855
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?

1526
00:41:29,855 --> 00:41:30,556

1527
00:41:30,556 --> 00:41:32,558
GRANNY KNOWS.
