1
00:00:03,829 --> 00:00:05,135
- Hi, I'm Felicia.

2
00:00:05,266 --> 00:00:08,399
I'm 17, and I live in
Lewisville, Texas,

3
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:11,098
typical small-town USA.

4
00:00:11,228 --> 00:00:12,186
I live at home with my
grandmother, mom,

5
00:00:12,316 --> 00:00:15,363
and step-dad.

6
00:00:15,493 --> 00:00:17,843
Oh, my god. Again?

7
00:00:17,974 --> 00:00:19,845
I'm a senior this year,
and studying is my number one

8
00:00:19,976 --> 00:00:21,412
priority.

9
00:00:21,543 --> 00:00:24,024
There's a lot of pressure
from my mom to do well

10
00:00:24,154 --> 00:00:26,765
because no one in my family
has ever graduated high school.

11
00:00:26,896 --> 00:00:28,506
I'll be the first one.

12
00:00:28,637 --> 00:00:30,247
'cause nobody's gone to the
12th grade, and that's why

13
00:00:30,378 --> 00:00:32,075
I want to do it.

14
00:00:32,206 --> 00:00:33,294
My life is hectic, but I still
find time to hang

15
00:00:33,424 --> 00:00:35,252
with my girls.

16
00:00:35,383 --> 00:00:36,253
Goodness, gracious.

17
00:00:36,384 --> 00:00:38,690
I am starving.

18
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:40,475
And my boyfriend, Alex.

19
00:00:40,605 --> 00:00:43,260
He works part-time as a barber
and dances in a crew with

20
00:00:43,391 --> 00:00:44,609
his friends.

21
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:47,003
We've been together
for two years.

22
00:00:47,134 --> 00:00:49,571
My mom isn't thrilled
that I spend so much time

23
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:50,963
with him.

24
00:00:51,094 --> 00:00:52,356
- Felicia, what are you doing
in there?

25
00:00:52,487 --> 00:00:55,229
- She always thinks we're
messing around and that

26
00:00:55,359 --> 00:00:57,013
it's taking time away from
my studying.

27
00:00:57,144 --> 00:00:58,493
- Open the damned door,
Felicia!

28
00:00:58,623 --> 00:01:00,321
- Mom, go away!

29
00:01:00,451 --> 00:01:02,932
But she doesn't have to guess
what goes on behind closed doors

30
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:06,805
anymore, because I'm pregnant.

31
00:01:06,936 --> 00:01:08,807
[chime dings]

32
00:01:18,556 --> 00:01:20,602
I'm just starting my senior year
of high school.

33
00:01:20,732 --> 00:01:22,560
It's been an eventful summer.

34
00:01:22,691 --> 00:01:25,911
After finding out I was
pregnant, I took night school

35
00:01:26,042 --> 00:01:29,001
classes to keep me on track
to graduate with my friends.

36
00:01:29,132 --> 00:01:30,829
And they're always asking me
about my pregnancy.

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,571
- So, Felicia, how did you
tell your mom?

38
00:01:33,702 --> 00:01:35,530
- My period never came.

39
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,358
- You told her that you didn't
get your period?

40
00:01:37,488 --> 00:01:38,837
- Well, yeah, I had told her.

41
00:01:38,968 --> 00:01:40,317
I was like, "I still haven't
gotten it," 'cause she kept

42
00:01:40,448 --> 00:01:42,058
asking me, "How come you haven't
gotten your period?"

43
00:01:42,189 --> 00:01:44,060
she knows, like, I usually
have it on a set date.

44
00:01:44,191 --> 00:01:46,845
She was like, "I'm gonna get
you a pregnancy test."

45
00:01:46,976 --> 00:01:48,456
And then I just handed
the pregnancy test to her,

46
00:01:48,586 --> 00:01:50,849
and she's like, "So you're
not pregnant?"

47
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,025
I was like, "No, Mom.

48
00:01:53,156 --> 00:01:54,592
It says I'm pregnant."

49
00:01:54,723 --> 00:01:56,333
[laughter]

50
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:01,033
- Yeah, I mean, yeah, 'cause
I took night school, and I

51
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:02,687
should graduate this year.

52
00:02:02,818 --> 00:02:04,472
My friends are pretty
understanding.

53
00:02:04,602 --> 00:02:07,039
I just wish my mom was too.

54
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,738
She really wants me to graduate
this year, since I'd be the

55
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:12,393
first in the family to finish
high school, but getting

56
00:02:12,523 --> 00:02:14,525
pregnant wasn't exactly part
of her curriculum.

57
00:02:14,656 --> 00:02:16,527
- Okay.

58
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:33,240
- I didn't believe it would
happen to me, but...

59
00:02:44,425 --> 00:02:46,209
- It's not gonna stop me.

60
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,385
You know that's always been
my goal, to graduate

61
00:02:48,516 --> 00:02:50,344
in this family.

62
00:02:59,135 --> 00:03:01,616
- I know my mom's worried that
having a baby will prevent me

63
00:03:01,746 --> 00:03:05,837
from graduating, but I think
I can handle it, especially

64
00:03:05,968 --> 00:03:07,752
since Alex is here to
support me.

65
00:03:07,883 --> 00:03:10,668
I convinced my mom to let him
live at our house during my

66
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:12,627
pregnancy.

67
00:03:12,757 --> 00:03:15,456
She thinks Alex spends too much
time with his friends and isn't

68
00:03:15,586 --> 00:03:18,328
mature enough to support me
once the baby comes.

69
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:21,244
But he's my first love,
and I know he'll be there.

70
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,898
- Do you remember when we
first met?

71
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:24,552
Do you remember?

72
00:03:24,682 --> 00:03:26,206
- I remember the first time
Jasmine showed me you on

73
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:29,557
Myspace, and I was like,
"Well, he's mine."

74
00:03:29,687 --> 00:03:32,212
I saw you, and I was like,
"He's mine."

75
00:03:32,342 --> 00:03:34,170
- I had danced with that girl
Jessica.

76
00:03:34,301 --> 00:03:35,693
- Yes, and you made me mad.

77
00:03:35,824 --> 00:03:41,569
And then you came to me,
and I got happy.

78
00:03:41,699 --> 00:03:43,745
- You think you're ready
to be a mom or what?

79
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,182
- I don't know.

80
00:03:46,313 --> 00:03:49,359
I mean, I have to be ready.

81
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,231
It's gonna be different.

82
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:52,667
- It's already been different.

83
00:03:52,797 --> 00:03:54,408
- I know, and it's gonna be
way different once she's

84
00:03:54,538 --> 00:03:55,974
actually out of my stomach.

85
00:03:56,105 --> 00:03:58,629
Both of my sisters had their
kids young, and I remember.

86
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,024
I was like, "I'm not--
that's not gonna be me."

87
00:04:02,154 --> 00:04:03,721
- Yeah.

88
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:05,332
I honestly never even thought
I was gonna have kids

89
00:04:05,462 --> 00:04:07,072
this young.

90
00:04:07,203 --> 00:04:09,814
- Despite what my mom thinks,
I'm really glad Alex has stuck

91
00:04:09,945 --> 00:04:12,687
by me since finding out I was
pregnant.

92
00:04:12,817 --> 00:04:14,819
We definitely didn't think
it would happen to us

93
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:16,691
and neither did our friends.

94
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:19,302
- You would never expect
you to be pregnant.

95
00:04:19,433 --> 00:04:20,608
It's shocking.

96
00:04:20,738 --> 00:04:23,393
- I know, I saw myself
as a goody-goody too.

97
00:04:23,524 --> 00:04:25,265
- So did y'all actually use
condoms?

98
00:04:25,395 --> 00:04:27,832
- Honestly, we never used
a condom.

99
00:04:27,963 --> 00:04:30,748
We used a condom, like,
twice ever in our whole

100
00:04:30,879 --> 00:04:32,533
entire relationship.

101
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:34,665
- That's what's up.

102
00:04:34,796 --> 00:04:36,928
But at least you're not running
away from it, like...

103
00:04:37,059 --> 00:04:43,413
- Like, 'cause I lost it
to him, and I'm having his kid.

104
00:04:43,544 --> 00:04:44,588
So I'm glad that it's him.

105
00:04:44,719 --> 00:04:47,069
- But did you want a baby,
like...

106
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:49,114
- No, not at this time.

107
00:04:49,245 --> 00:04:52,335
I definitely didn't want one
now.

108
00:04:52,466 --> 00:04:54,119
I had, like, so much planned
for myself.

109
00:04:57,122 --> 00:04:58,820
I'm a little worried.

110
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:01,213
Raising a baby and being the
first in my family to graduate

111
00:05:01,344 --> 00:05:02,650
high school isn't going to be
easy.

112
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,826
[baby crying]

113
00:05:13,182 --> 00:05:14,488
- It's a been a month since
I convinced my mom to let Alex

114
00:05:14,618 --> 00:05:17,186
move in so he can be here for me
when I have the baby,

115
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,928
but we never get any privacy.

116
00:05:20,058 --> 00:05:22,017
It looks so ugly all faded now.

117
00:05:22,147 --> 00:05:22,713
Do yours fade?

118
00:05:22,844 --> 00:05:24,367
- Nah.

119
00:05:24,498 --> 00:05:25,803
That's 'cause you didn't
put no lotion or nothing.

120
00:05:25,934 --> 00:05:27,892
- Close the door.
- Why?

121
00:05:28,023 --> 00:05:29,807
- 'Cause of my mom.

122
00:05:29,938 --> 00:05:31,418
- She doesn't even know about
your tattoo, huh?

123
00:05:31,548 --> 00:05:32,897
- No.

124
00:05:33,028 --> 00:05:35,073
She usually works most nights,
but when she's home, she's

125
00:05:35,204 --> 00:05:36,727
always on our case.

126
00:05:36,858 --> 00:05:38,729
- Felicia?

127
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,731
- Even though we're already
pregnant, my mom never wants us

128
00:05:40,862 --> 00:05:42,472
to be behind closed doors.

129
00:05:42,603 --> 00:05:43,952
[knocking at door]
- What are you doing in there?

130
00:05:44,082 --> 00:05:45,083
- Mom!

131
00:05:45,214 --> 00:05:46,955
Can you please go away?

132
00:05:47,085 --> 00:05:48,391
- Ooh, I hate this.

133
00:05:48,522 --> 00:05:51,699
Why you--you always close
the door!

134
00:05:51,829 --> 00:05:53,657
- My older sister moved out
when she got pregnant at

135
00:05:53,788 --> 00:05:54,658
a young age.

136
00:05:54,789 --> 00:05:57,879
You never give us privacy.
- Damn.

137
00:05:58,009 --> 00:06:00,011
Why she want to know what
we're doing in the restroom?

138
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:03,275
- So I feel like she understands
what I'm going through.

139
00:06:03,406 --> 00:06:05,147
[phone beeps]
- Hello?

140
00:06:05,277 --> 00:06:07,367
- Ciara?
- Yeah?

141
00:06:07,497 --> 00:06:09,281
- You know how it is down over
here at Mom's.

142
00:06:09,412 --> 00:06:10,370
There's, like, a lot of stress.

143
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:11,806
- Really?

144
00:06:11,936 --> 00:06:13,808
- And there's just stress
'cause Mom, you know, when she

145
00:06:13,938 --> 00:06:16,288
gets mad, she goes crazy,
and she's always screaming.

146
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:17,812
- I mean, I told you.

147
00:06:17,942 --> 00:06:20,031
You always have--you know,
I always have my doors open.

148
00:06:20,162 --> 00:06:21,859
- Mm-hmm.

149
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,948
It's nice of Ciara to offer us
a place to stay at her

150
00:06:24,079 --> 00:06:26,647
apartment, but right now,
it's easier to have my mom

151
00:06:26,777 --> 00:06:30,651
around to help us, even if
she's overbearing.

152
00:06:30,781 --> 00:06:33,349
She set a curfew for Alex
to be back in the house,

153
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:35,133
which didn't go over well
because he works a lot

154
00:06:35,264 --> 00:06:38,789
and stays out really late.

155
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,183
And it seems the more my mom
annoys Alex, the more time

156
00:06:41,313 --> 00:06:44,534
he wants to spend elsewhere.

157
00:06:44,665 --> 00:06:45,535
- What is wrong with your mom,
man?

158
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,146
She's been trippin' lately,
for reals.

159
00:06:48,277 --> 00:06:49,147
She just comes in like nothing.

160
00:06:49,278 --> 00:06:51,367
She doesn't even respect
nothing.

161
00:06:51,498 --> 00:06:53,325
- She always says
'cause this is her house.

162
00:06:53,456 --> 00:06:55,153
- It's just not working.

163
00:06:55,284 --> 00:06:56,764
It's pissing me off.

164
00:06:56,894 --> 00:06:59,897
- I know Alex is losing
his patience with my mom,

165
00:07:00,028 --> 00:07:02,509
but my parents aren't happy
with his bad habits.

166
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,554
- When he goes all the time
and all the time, like,

167
00:07:04,685 --> 00:07:06,382
see, he comes at 2:00
in the morning.

168
00:07:06,513 --> 00:07:07,862
This is a problem for us.

169
00:07:07,992 --> 00:07:10,560
We need to fix it too
because he lives in our home.

170
00:07:10,691 --> 00:07:12,562
- He's gonna have to do
some changing.

171
00:07:12,693 --> 00:07:15,217
He's got a rude awakening
coming too.

172
00:07:15,347 --> 00:07:18,481
This all looks like fun and
games, but when it comes out--

173
00:07:18,612 --> 00:07:22,746
[chuckles]--
life is going to change,

174
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:25,532
and it's gonna be--
it's gonna get tough.

175
00:07:25,662 --> 00:07:27,664
- My parents have a good point.

176
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:30,885
Alex does have some growing up
to do.

177
00:07:31,015 --> 00:07:33,017
I just hope living at my mom's
house doesn't push him away

178
00:07:33,148 --> 00:07:34,671
for good.

179
00:07:34,802 --> 00:07:37,587
Since he is out all the time
or at work, my mom's been the

180
00:07:37,718 --> 00:07:39,676
one taking me to doctor's
appointments.

181
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:48,468
[monitor pulsing]
- 143 beats per minute.

182
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:50,382
And now the baby is looking
at you.

183
00:07:50,513 --> 00:07:52,559
- Oh.
- Little baby!

184
00:07:52,689 --> 00:07:53,298
- Oh, I see.

185
00:07:53,429 --> 00:07:55,431
- That's cute.

186
00:07:55,562 --> 00:07:56,388
So what are you gonna name her?

187
00:07:56,519 --> 00:07:58,739
- Genesis.
- Genesis.

188
00:07:58,869 --> 00:08:01,742
That's a beautiful name.
We're all done.

189
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:03,570
Cute baby.

190
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,093
- It's so cute. Very cute.

191
00:08:05,223 --> 00:08:08,052
That is beautiful.

192
00:08:08,183 --> 00:08:10,838
- My mom can tell I'm upset
Alex isn't here for the

193
00:08:10,968 --> 00:08:13,797
sonogram, so today, she's
going to talk to him about

194
00:08:13,928 --> 00:08:14,581
his priorities.

195
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,454
- Yeah?

196
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:20,325
- Just out with one of
my friends.

197
00:08:20,456 --> 00:08:21,544
- Yeah, you see?

198
00:08:26,375 --> 00:08:27,681
- It's not like--

199
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:33,164
- I don't need to tell you
where I'm going.

200
00:08:33,295 --> 00:08:34,209
That's the thing.

201
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:35,340
You get in my business.

202
00:08:35,471 --> 00:08:36,603
You don't even know.
You're not my mom.

203
00:08:38,256 --> 00:08:39,954
- You mom's just trippin'.
I'm just tired of it.

204
00:08:40,084 --> 00:08:42,565
- You're running away always
when I want to talk to you.

205
00:08:42,696 --> 00:08:43,871
- I'm not running away from
anything.

206
00:08:44,001 --> 00:08:45,307
It's just you, basically.

207
00:08:45,437 --> 00:08:46,003
I just can't stand it here,
so I'm just gonna go ahead

208
00:08:46,134 --> 00:08:47,831
and leave.

209
00:08:52,923 --> 00:08:54,577
- I don't need to face
anything.

210
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:58,320
- I know my mom can be
annoying, but I wish Alex

211
00:08:58,450 --> 00:09:00,104
could try harder to get along
with her.

212
00:09:00,235 --> 00:09:02,629
Once the baby is here,
we're gonna need her support.

213
00:09:06,371 --> 00:09:09,200
Over the next week, things
between Alex and my mom

214
00:09:09,331 --> 00:09:10,767
didn't get any better.

215
00:09:10,898 --> 00:09:12,421
I hope they smooth things over
soon, since I plan on being

216
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:16,947
with Alex for a long time.

217
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:19,950
- So do you and Alex really
think y'all are, like,

218
00:09:20,081 --> 00:09:23,519
gonna get married, like,
y'all are gonna work out?

219
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,565
- I don't know. I hope.

220
00:09:25,695 --> 00:09:27,349
- Right, all you can do
is hope.

221
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:28,480
- Does he want to get married?

222
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:30,482
- Later in life, not now.

223
00:09:30,613 --> 00:09:32,920
Like, if things go right.

224
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:35,749
- So if y'all don't work out,
what are you gonna do?

225
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:38,926
- If I didn't have Alex,
I would be, like,

226
00:09:39,056 --> 00:09:41,145
financially dead.

227
00:09:41,276 --> 00:09:43,408
I depend on him.

228
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:44,975
- That's crazy that he has
that much power.

229
00:09:45,106 --> 00:09:46,542
- Like, literally, I--
every--I depend on him,

230
00:09:46,673 --> 00:09:49,806
'cause he's my money.

231
00:09:49,937 --> 00:09:51,460
- Wait, so, like, when you
graduate, right, are you gonna,

232
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:53,680
like, go to college?

233
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:56,117
- I want to open up my own
salon with Alex, since he's

234
00:09:56,247 --> 00:09:57,684
a barber.

235
00:09:57,814 --> 00:10:00,774
- Oh, that's cute.
- Yeah.

236
00:10:05,561 --> 00:10:06,997
- So how are you and your girl?

237
00:10:07,128 --> 00:10:09,696
- Just bad things have been
going on lately.

238
00:10:09,826 --> 00:10:10,914
- Mm-hmm.

239
00:10:11,045 --> 00:10:12,786
- Me and her mom started
getting into it crazy.

240
00:10:12,916 --> 00:10:14,309
- Yeah.

241
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:16,746
- It's just not really tight,
man, 'cause it's nothing but

242
00:10:16,877 --> 00:10:18,356
arguments and arguments,
fights.

243
00:10:18,487 --> 00:10:20,228
I want to move out.

244
00:10:20,358 --> 00:10:21,708
You know, I really want to move
out as soon as possible.

245
00:10:21,838 --> 00:10:23,274
- Mm-hmm.

246
00:10:23,405 --> 00:10:25,842
- When Alex got home from work,
he was still pretty annoyed

247
00:10:25,973 --> 00:10:28,192
at my mom, and he doesn't think
things are going to get any

248
00:10:28,323 --> 00:10:29,541
better.

249
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:30,586
- I've been wanting
to move out.

250
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:31,979
I already told you.

251
00:10:32,109 --> 00:10:34,372
Either you come with me
or I go, 'cause I can't

252
00:10:34,503 --> 00:10:36,026
stand it here.

253
00:10:36,157 --> 00:10:37,419
I've been telling you that
for the past month.

254
00:10:37,549 --> 00:10:41,771
- It's gonna be harder, though,
if we move out on our own.

255
00:10:41,902 --> 00:10:43,251
- 'cause there's too much
stress in here.

256
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:47,429
- If we move to my sister's,
will you stick around more?

257
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:49,126
- We just need to move out.

258
00:10:49,257 --> 00:10:50,475
It's not working.

259
00:10:50,606 --> 00:10:52,826
I just think it's better,
you know?

260
00:10:52,956 --> 00:10:56,873
Our relationship is gonna be
better now.

261
00:10:57,004 --> 00:11:00,268
- I'm still on the fence about
leaving this house, but maybe

262
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:02,792
getting away from my mom will
bring Alex and I closer

263
00:11:02,923 --> 00:11:03,750
together.

264
00:11:06,927 --> 00:11:10,234
I know my mom is going to be
really surprised.

265
00:11:10,365 --> 00:11:12,628
To avoid confrontation,
Alex rented a moving truck

266
00:11:12,759 --> 00:11:15,022
that night so we could move our
stuff while my mom and step-dad

267
00:11:15,152 --> 00:11:16,458
are out.

268
00:11:16,588 --> 00:11:18,547
[objects rattling]

269
00:11:34,606 --> 00:11:37,653
- Now that we're at my sister's
apartment, I'm still getting

270
00:11:37,784 --> 00:11:39,742
used to the fact that my mom
won't be around to help with

271
00:11:39,873 --> 00:11:41,091
the baby.

272
00:11:41,222 --> 00:11:43,093
Where am I gonna put all
the baby stuff?

273
00:11:43,224 --> 00:11:45,313
- Don't ask me.
It's your baby.

274
00:11:45,443 --> 00:11:46,793
[laughter]
- Well, duh.

275
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:48,664
- I talked to Mom.

276
00:11:48,795 --> 00:11:50,318
- About what?

277
00:11:50,448 --> 00:11:52,233
- She was telling me that she
told you that she wanted you

278
00:11:52,363 --> 00:11:53,669
to stay.

279
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:57,020
- It wasn't necessarily like
I had to leave, but I just

280
00:11:57,151 --> 00:12:00,850
didn't want to deal with Alex
not getting along with Mom.

281
00:12:00,981 --> 00:12:03,505
My mom was really surprised
and disappointed when she found

282
00:12:03,635 --> 00:12:06,160
out Alex and I moved in with
my sister.

283
00:12:06,290 --> 00:12:08,249
She wasted no time in letting me
know.

284
00:12:08,379 --> 00:12:10,294
- Felicia!

285
00:12:10,425 --> 00:12:12,340
- Hi.

286
00:12:37,365 --> 00:12:38,888
- Well, I had to leave
sooner or later, Mom.

287
00:12:39,019 --> 00:12:40,716
You have to...

288
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:42,022
Get through it.

289
00:12:46,156 --> 00:12:47,462
- I hope so.

290
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:51,422
- It's hard for me to pretend
that I don't need my mom's help,

291
00:12:51,553 --> 00:12:54,295
but right now, it's important
for me to be with Alex.

292
00:12:54,425 --> 00:12:55,252
- I love you.
- Love you too.

293
00:12:55,383 --> 00:12:57,733
- Bye.

294
00:12:57,864 --> 00:13:00,867
- I didn't necessarily want
to leave, but I hope that Alex

295
00:13:00,997 --> 00:13:02,782
will be happier to be out of
my mom's house.

296
00:13:02,912 --> 00:13:04,566
- You have my word.
I'll be there.

297
00:13:04,696 --> 00:13:06,089
All right, see you later.

298
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:08,483
- So far, he hasn't spent much
time at home.

299
00:13:08,613 --> 00:13:10,180
Bye.

300
00:13:10,311 --> 00:13:11,312
And even though we picked
Genesis as our little girl's

301
00:13:11,442 --> 00:13:13,444
name, he missed another checkup.

302
00:13:13,575 --> 00:13:16,926
I hope we can start spending
more time together now.

303
00:13:17,057 --> 00:13:19,407
You're gonna wake up in the
morning and in the nighttime

304
00:13:19,537 --> 00:13:20,756
when she's crying?

305
00:13:20,887 --> 00:13:23,063
Or are you gonna make me
do all the work?

306
00:13:23,193 --> 00:13:24,412
- We could take turns.

307
00:13:24,542 --> 00:13:26,109
You could do it for a full week
and then--

308
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,895
- That'll never happen.

309
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:30,766
I think you'll get--
- No, trust me.

310
00:13:30,897 --> 00:13:32,202
- You'll get frustrated
of her crying.

311
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,422
- Like, right now, right now,
you might be saying that,

312
00:13:34,552 --> 00:13:36,032
but I bet you whatever
I'm gonna get attached to--

313
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:38,121
I'm gonna get attached to her.

314
00:13:38,252 --> 00:13:42,473
- You gonna spend more time
at home?

315
00:13:42,604 --> 00:13:44,736
Alex isn't too convincing
when he says he's going to be

316
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:46,260
here to help with the baby.

317
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:49,176
I hope he gets serious soon
about his commitment because

318
00:13:49,306 --> 00:13:53,093
I've got a lot of schoolwork
to do.

319
00:13:53,223 --> 00:13:55,835
I really want to keep up
with my studies, but being

320
00:13:55,965 --> 00:13:58,272
pregnant is exhausting.

321
00:13:58,402 --> 00:14:01,666
It's getting harder to focus
in class, and I barely have

322
00:14:01,797 --> 00:14:03,364
the energy to do my homework.

323
00:14:03,494 --> 00:14:04,800
- Hey, babe.

324
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:06,410
- I hate math.

325
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:09,326
- I would help you, but,
you know, I don't want to give

326
00:14:09,457 --> 00:14:11,676
you the answers, because--
- Because they'll be wrong.

327
00:14:11,807 --> 00:14:14,984
- No, because then--
- Because they'll be wrong.

328
00:14:15,115 --> 00:14:16,986
Alex just got home from work,
and as usual, he's already

329
00:14:17,117 --> 00:14:19,989
leaving again to be with his
friends.

330
00:14:25,255 --> 00:14:26,909
- Ladies first.
Ladies first as always.

331
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,433
- I guess he'd rather
be elsewhere.

332
00:14:29,564 --> 00:14:32,306
- Let's do this.

333
00:14:32,436 --> 00:14:33,785
- Are you ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

334
00:14:35,178 --> 00:14:39,791
- ♪ If you were me 
♪ And I was you 

335
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:44,884
♪ And we could see 
♪ Completely through 

336
00:14:53,153 --> 00:14:57,070
- It's 2:30 in the morning,
and he's still not back.

337
00:15:05,382 --> 00:15:10,213
- I'm really pissed at Alex
for staying out all night.

338
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:14,217
He doesn't seem to care that
I'm home alone now more often.

339
00:15:14,348 --> 00:15:16,350
It really worries me.

340
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:20,093
Is this how it's going to be
when the baby comes?

341
00:15:20,223 --> 00:15:21,921
Probably.

Mom, I want to, like,
come back to your house,

517
00:26:04,954 --> 00:26:08,349
'cause I'm gonna need help
with the baby.

518
00:26:10,177 --> 00:26:14,007
- I want to, like, go
straight--after I get out

519
00:26:14,137 --> 00:26:15,965
of the hospital tomorrow,
like, go straight to y'all's

520

get up, really.

521
00:26:18,315 --> 00:26:21,797
It hurts, and I'm not gonna have
anyone to help me at Ciara's,

522
00:26:21,928 --> 00:26:25,453
'cause Alex works, so I'll be
by myself that whole time.

523
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,802
- Yeah, that's not good.

524
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:32,112
Well, I love you,
and I can't wait.

- Bye, sweetheart.
- You know, we love you, okay?

526
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,682
- I'm glad my mom is willing
to have us back at her house,

527
00:26:36,812 --> 00:26:39,423
so I texted Alex, and I told him
the plan.

528
00:26:39,554 --> 00:26:41,861
He wasn't happy, but it's the
right thing to do for the baby,

529
00:26:41,991 --> 00:26:46,300
especially if he isn't going
to take any time off of work.

00:26:49,999 --> 00:26:53,263

four or five hours, basically.

00:26:53,394 --> 00:26:54,787
- I know, but...

534
00:26:54,917 --> 00:26:57,659
But at least he agreed to drive
me home to my mom's house.

535

or the green one?

Yeah, the pink.

- I thought you weren't gonna
spend more than $70.

637
00:32:36,867 --> 00:32:39,435
- It was just $10 more.

638
00:32:39,566 --> 00:32:42,134
- $10 that could have been used
on the stroller.

in a year from now?

Mini mommy.

It's all I could think about.

670
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:17,968
- Boring.

671
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:26,716
- I could have graduated
in 2 1/2 weeks, but since

672
00:34:26,847 --> 00:34:31,112
the semester already started
and I'm behind, I have to make

673
00:34:31,243 --> 00:34:33,897
up my hours before this year
is over.

674
00:34:34,028 --> 00:34:36,074
Then I'll graduate, probably.

675
00:34:48,695 --> 00:34:50,740
- Yeah.
- Yes?

676
00:34:52,916 --> 00:34:55,093

There, you see?

687
00:36:02,551 --> 00:36:04,858
Crybaby.

688
00:36:19,002 --> 00:36:20,047
- Are you done?

689
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,789
- No.

690
00:36:25,922 --> 00:36:28,011
All right.

691
00:36:31,319 --> 00:36:34,627
Alex was no help babysitting
tonight.

692
00:36:34,757 --> 00:36:36,846
Gonna fail this test.

693
00:36:36,977 --> 00:36:39,719
I've got a ton of homework
to do.

694
00:36:39,849 --> 00:36:42,243
I'm so behind, and he doesn't
even care.

Why am I the only one
who gets up at night

699
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:07,834
when Genesis starts crying?

700
00:37:34,643 --> 00:37:37,080
- Alex's behavior sucks.

701
00:37:37,211 --> 00:37:40,475
He needs to grow up and accept
his responsibilities.

702
00:37:40,606 --> 00:37:42,912
There's no way I'll be able
to graduate high school without

703
00:37:43,043 --> 00:37:45,828
his help, and my mom will be
devastated.

704
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:48,962
I waited for him to come home
that day after work, because

705
00:37:49,092 --> 00:37:50,137
we really need to talk.

706
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,008
- What are y'all doing?

707
00:37:52,139 --> 00:37:54,837
- Just hanging out.

708
00:37:59,842 --> 00:38:02,671
Whenever you come home,
it's, like, sometimes I would

709
00:38:02,802 --> 00:38:06,936
want some help with her,
and I really never get that.

710
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:08,329
- That's it?

711
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:11,985
- You act like it's
an easy job.

712
00:38:12,115 --> 00:38:14,422
You act like I do nothing.

713
00:38:14,553 --> 00:38:18,905
- I'd rather take care of her
and you go to work, so you can

714
00:38:19,035 --> 00:38:21,647
see how I feel.
I just want you to.

715
00:38:21,777 --> 00:38:24,563
I would rather, honestly,
take care of her.

716
00:38:24,693 --> 00:38:25,999
- I'd rather work.
- Tell you what.

717
00:38:26,129 --> 00:38:29,698
Let's switch then.
You'll see how it is.

718
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:32,788
But you're also gonna take care
of her and me, right?

719
00:38:32,919 --> 00:38:35,356
And pay rent and pay for food?

720
00:38:35,487 --> 00:38:37,706
And for diapers and everything?

721
00:38:37,837 --> 00:38:40,622
- I'm just saying you don't
help with Genesis at all.

722
00:38:40,753 --> 00:38:45,714
You come home, and I still
don't get no help.

723
00:38:45,845 --> 00:38:48,369
She's still in my arms
the whole day, the whole night.

724
00:38:51,503 --> 00:38:54,375
- You're not happy, are you?
- No.

725
00:38:58,510 --> 00:39:03,863
Honestly, I know I used to bug
about you not being with me

726
00:39:03,993 --> 00:39:07,823
all the time, but now that
I have Genesis, I could care

727
00:39:07,954 --> 00:39:10,565
less if you're with me,
but this is your daughter.

728
00:39:27,016 --> 00:39:30,150
- I know, in the future,
things do change, and me

729
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,719
and Alex do get better, and he
helps me to help her grow,

730
00:39:33,849 --> 00:39:38,332
and I don't want her to see us
going through struggles.

731
00:39:38,463 --> 00:39:42,075
Being a parent is frustrating.

732
00:39:42,205 --> 00:39:44,556
There's a lot that you have to
give up.

733
00:39:44,686 --> 00:39:47,254
It's like nothing's about me
anymore.

734
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,603
Everything is about her.

735
00:39:48,734 --> 00:39:51,345
Genesis needs her father
to be there for her.

736
00:39:51,476 --> 00:39:56,002
And I don't want her not having
a dad, not knowing who her

737
00:39:56,132 --> 00:39:57,960
real dad is.

738
00:39:58,091 --> 00:40:02,356
But I know things probably won't
end up being good between us.

739
00:40:02,487 --> 00:40:04,924
I'm not a teenager anymore.

740
00:40:05,054 --> 00:40:09,755
I'm a mom, and that's hard
to say, but I'm a mom now,

741
00:40:09,885 --> 00:40:14,629
and my teenage life is pretty
much over.

742
00:40:25,292 --> 00:40:26,815
- I want to be the first one
to graduate in my family

743
00:40:26,946 --> 00:40:32,647
for my mom and for Genesis,
but literally, it's just--

744
00:40:32,778 --> 00:40:35,345
it's not easy,
and having the baby has put me

745
00:40:35,476 --> 00:40:38,914
a lot behind in my schoolwork.

746
00:40:39,045 --> 00:40:41,482
If I could go back in time
before all this happened

747
00:40:41,613 --> 00:40:47,749
and do it all over again,
I would, 'cause this is not

748
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:50,099
the life I planned for me.

749
00:41:06,028 --> 00:41:08,509
- My mom made me move out.

750
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,512
I was not allowed to live
under her roof pregnant.

751
00:41:11,643 --> 00:41:13,906
- Probably go and see you
at Huntsville.

752
00:41:14,036 --> 00:41:15,603
You better be living with me.

753
00:41:15,734 --> 00:41:19,302
- We're promoting Daniel's
education, and what about

754
00:41:19,433 --> 00:41:21,522
the girl here?

755
00:41:21,653 --> 00:41:23,219
- Push, push, push.

756
00:41:23,350 --> 00:41:24,873
- Oh!

757
00:41:25,004 --> 00:41:26,875
- I just don't want to feel
like I'm stuck with you.

758
00:41:27,006 --> 00:41:28,007
- Well, you are.

759
00:41:28,137 --> 00:41:29,574
- When are you gonna
wake the hell up?

760
00:41:29,704 --> 00:41:31,576
You got a baby, sweetie.
