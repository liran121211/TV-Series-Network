00:00:02,036 --> 00:00:04,905
- *

2
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:06,340
- CHRISTINNA: I am Christinna.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,942
I'm 17, and I grew up
in upstate New York.

4
00:00:09,043 --> 00:00:11,145
My mom and I moved down
to Huntsville, Alabama,

5
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:12,546
when I was a junior,

6
00:00:12,646 --> 00:00:14,848
and getting adjusted to the
South has been a challenge.

7
00:00:14,948 --> 00:00:18,286
I don't know why they have
their mustaches down to here.

8
00:00:18,386 --> 00:00:20,088
All they talk about
is football down here,

9
00:00:20,188 --> 00:00:23,624
and I couldn't care less--
until I started dating Isiah,

10
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:25,226
the star of our high
school football team.

11
00:00:25,326 --> 00:00:26,727
- [ding]

12
00:00:26,827 --> 00:00:28,562
- CHRISTINNA: We were psyched
when Isiah got a scholarship

13
00:00:28,662 --> 00:00:30,798
to play college football.
I graduated early

14
00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:33,234
so I could go off
to college with him.

15
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:34,835
We have our futures
all mapped out.

16
00:00:34,935 --> 00:00:36,937
I'm going to teach English
to inner-city kids,

17
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,207
and Isiah's going to the NFL.

18
00:00:39,307 --> 00:00:41,142
The only problem
is that his grandma

19
00:00:41,242 --> 00:00:43,144
is not a big fan
of our relationship.

20
00:00:43,244 --> 00:00:44,478
- Christinna, you
will get to know me.

21
00:00:44,578 --> 00:00:45,946
I do speak my mind.

22
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:47,815
- CHRISTINNA: All my plans
got turned upside down

23
00:00:47,915 --> 00:00:50,084
when Isiah and I didn't
take off for college.

24
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:52,753
I moved into his mom's
house instead of the dorms,

25
00:00:52,853 --> 00:00:56,824
and we snuck off and got
married on our own, because...

26
00:00:56,924 --> 00:00:58,159
I'm pregnant.

27
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:01,729
- *

28
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:06,500
- *

29
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,068
- ISIAH: [indistinct chatter]

30
00:01:09,937 --> 00:01:12,406
- Look at these eggs.
- Is it expired?

31
00:01:12,506 --> 00:01:14,842
- No, I looked at it.
- It's not?

32
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:16,277
They're just brown.

33
00:01:16,377 --> 00:01:19,447
Sometimes it feels like Isiah
and I are just playing house.

34
00:01:19,547 --> 00:01:21,282
But with our baby
just two months away,

35
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:23,684
we're forced to get serious.

36
00:01:23,784 --> 00:01:25,253
We were only
dating for eight months

37
00:01:25,353 --> 00:01:27,020
when I found out I was pregnant.

38
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:29,390
And even though it seemed quick,
we both thought getting married

39
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,059
was the best thing for our baby.

40
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:35,196
Isiah and I threw out any
idea of a traditional wedding,

41
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:36,897
including letting
any of Isiah's family

42
00:01:36,997 --> 00:01:38,466
know about our decision,

43
00:01:38,566 --> 00:01:40,468
and there's still
some bad feelings around that.

44
00:01:43,036 --> 00:01:45,373
Isiah's high school
football days might be over,

45
00:01:45,473 --> 00:01:47,141
but the team still drops by.

46
00:01:47,241 --> 00:01:48,209
Luckily you couldn't see

47
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:51,111
Isiah's whole tux
in this picture.

48
00:01:51,212 --> 00:01:52,713
- [laughter]

49
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:54,248
- You was pregnant
in that picture.

50
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:55,916
- I didn't know it, though.

51
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:57,751
I should've known.
I was being stupid.

52
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,188
- You went to the
bathroom, like, 10 times.

53
00:02:00,288 --> 00:02:01,655
- CHRISTINNA: Probably.

54
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:03,891
- So did you know that she
was pregnant during the prom?

55
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:05,159
- I didn't know, man.

56
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:07,060
We found out she was
pregnant on my 18th birthday.

57
00:02:07,161 --> 00:02:10,097
- That is horrible. Dang!

58
00:02:10,198 --> 00:02:12,666
- That was, like, right after
I signed my scholarship,

59
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:14,668
about to graduate,
just turned 18.

60
00:02:14,768 --> 00:02:16,704
Y'all, I found out
like that, man.

61
00:02:16,804 --> 00:02:18,706
- What was your reaction
like when you saw it?

62
00:02:18,806 --> 00:02:20,474
- I was crying, 'cause
I was thinking, like,

63
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:22,610
I can't do this,
that, that, that.

64
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:25,546
It's just done--
like, everything.

65
00:02:25,646 --> 00:02:28,015
- Y'all feel like y'all
ready to be parents?

66
00:02:28,115 --> 00:02:29,550
- We got no choice.

67
00:02:31,118 --> 00:02:32,453
- I don't know, man.

68
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:34,688
Take it one day at a time now.

69
00:02:37,258 --> 00:02:39,693
- CHRISTINNA: Even though we
all tried convincing him to go,

70
00:02:39,793 --> 00:02:41,329
Isiah gave up his
football scholarship

71
00:02:41,429 --> 00:02:42,796
to stay home with me,

72
00:02:42,896 --> 00:02:45,165
and I can see he's
still heartbroken about it.

73
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:47,801
- [crowd cheering]

74
00:02:50,771 --> 00:02:52,440
- CHRISTINNA: Now he's working
at a sandwich shop

75
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,875
until we can figure out
our next move.

76
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:57,745
Isiah's not the only one
who has to make sacrifices.

77
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,514
I gave up my senior year of
high school to graduate early.

78
00:03:00,614 --> 00:03:02,383
And now I have to take a break

79
00:03:02,483 --> 00:03:04,352
from community college
to have the baby.

80
00:03:04,452 --> 00:03:05,753
My friends
still have a hard time

81
00:03:05,853 --> 00:03:07,421
believing the whole situation.

82
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,390
- Did y'all just
not use protection?

83
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,858
Didn't feel like it?
Didn't want to?

84
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,226
- We did at first.

85
00:03:12,326 --> 00:03:15,429
We used a condom maybe three
times, and it broke one day.

86
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,331
- Oh... were you
on birth control?

87
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:18,466
- CHRISTINNA: No.

88
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:19,967
I mean, I didn't
really know too much,

89
00:03:20,067 --> 00:03:21,669
'cause I had never
had sex before.

90
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:24,505
So I was just, like, going
with the flow pretty much.

91
00:03:24,605 --> 00:03:26,840
I wasn't paying no attention
like I should've been.

92
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,443
And... he just started
getting careless, I guess.

93
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:31,144
I don't know.

94
00:03:31,245 --> 00:03:32,713
It's his fault, not mine.

95
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,515
- [laughter]
- No, I'm joking.

96
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:36,550
- What did your mom say
when you told her?

97
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,051
- I don't know.
It was weird.

98
00:03:38,151 --> 00:03:40,588
I thought she was gonnna
spaz at me, but she didn't.

99
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:42,590
She was, like, real nice
about it and everything.

100
00:03:42,690 --> 00:03:44,758
And then, like, I don't
know when Mother's Day was,

101
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:46,527
but she went out
and bought me, like,

102
00:03:46,627 --> 00:03:48,796
some flowers and this
little fruit basket thing.

103
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,865
And she was like, "Happy
first Mother's Day!"

104
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:52,800
- [laughter]

105
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,834
- [ding]

106
00:03:53,934 --> 00:03:55,336
- CHRISTINNA:
Unfortunately for me,

107
00:03:55,436 --> 00:03:58,839
that was the last Mother's Day
we'd live in the same town.

108
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:02,476
My mom came down to Alabama
to help out a sick relative.

109
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,011
When they got better,
my mom packed up

110
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:06,580
and moved back
to upstate New York.

111
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,048
I miss her,
but it freaks me out

112
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:11,285
because now I'm totally
dependent on Isiah's family.

113
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:13,954
Since Isiah dropped his
scholarship and got married,

114
00:04:14,054 --> 00:04:17,024
they're a little disappointed
in him and a lot mad at me.

115
00:04:17,124 --> 00:04:20,694
His grandma Kathy is only
talking to me through Isiah.

116
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:26,600
- Last week, I told you to
tell Christinna that basically,

117
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:29,837
I'm not really sorry
for how I feel.

118
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:33,507
I'm sorry for treating her the
way I did when I found out,

119
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,576
you know what I mean?
Did you tell her?

120
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:39,380
- Yes, I did.
- I wasn't really mad at you.

121
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:42,716
What I was upset about
was the marriage.

122
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,418
Not that I'm against you
guys getting married,

123
00:04:44,518 --> 00:04:46,219
'cause that would be
the right thing to do.

124
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,088
However, nowadays, come on.

125
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:50,624
You don't just-- people
don't-- 'cause you're pregnant,

126
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,092
they don't run on
and get married.

127
00:04:52,192 --> 00:04:54,928
- I don't talk much,
'cause it just hurts.

128
00:04:55,028 --> 00:04:57,565
I'm not happy.
I'm disappointed.

129
00:04:57,665 --> 00:04:59,700
I mean, I still don't believe
you guys really know

130
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,669
what you've really
gotten yourself into.

131
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:04,137
What are you plans?
Why did you want to get married?

132
00:05:05,373 --> 00:05:07,675
That's the real reason
you should've got married.

133
00:05:07,775 --> 00:05:10,043
I haven't heard neither
one of y'all say that ever.

134
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:12,946
You had a scholarship
to college.

135
00:05:13,046 --> 00:05:15,115
- That didn't feel like it
was the right decision.

136
00:05:15,215 --> 00:05:17,951
- You just didn't want to go.
- No, it was not the feelings.

137
00:05:18,051 --> 00:05:21,021
It was, like...

138
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:22,956
being there for
my child, though.

139
00:05:23,056 --> 00:05:25,426
- KATHY: How are you gonna feel
if she ain't yours?

140
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:26,860
Isiah,
I'm just gonna look at you

141
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,330
and tell you just like this.
Where are you now?

142
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:32,733
You didn't have to be here.

143
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,003
And not only are you here,
you brought something with you.

144
00:05:38,706 --> 00:05:40,140
- [claps]

145
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:46,179
- [sobs]

146
00:05:52,653 --> 00:05:54,655
- CHRISTINNA: After the way
I was treated by his family

147
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:57,891
last night, Isiah's
acting extra nice.

148
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:01,161
I understand they're upset about
what's happened to his plans,

149
00:06:01,261 --> 00:06:03,764
but this isn't how I planned
my senior year either.

150
00:06:03,864 --> 00:06:06,767
I definitely don't feel
welcome in this house anymore,

151
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:08,769
and it's putting a
strain on the two of us.

152
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:11,138
I don't know if I resent
you 'cause I'm pregnant,

153
00:06:11,238 --> 00:06:15,275
and not want to be,
because it's just kind of...

154
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:18,679
you've ruined everything
that I wanted for me or you.

155
00:06:18,779 --> 00:06:20,848
- You don't think like
that, like it's ruined, man.

156
00:06:20,948 --> 00:06:25,052
It's just delayed.
18 years from now, I'll be 36.

157
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:26,319
She'll be graduating
high school.

158
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,457
Say that's the only kid.
36 is still young.

159
00:06:29,557 --> 00:06:32,726
You can still go get your
degree, still travel the world.

160
00:06:32,826 --> 00:06:35,929
- But you can't get
your teenage years back.

161
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:39,166
- We both can't say anything
until she's actually born.

162
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:41,234
We'll look into her
eyes and be like, wow.

163
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,437
It's, like, really
important to me

164
00:06:43,537 --> 00:06:45,473
to actually try
to make it work, though.

165
00:06:49,777 --> 00:06:54,815
- *

166
00:06:54,915 --> 00:06:57,451
- [indistinct chatter]

167
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:59,086
- I think I'm good
on this other stuff.

168
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:01,054
- CHRISTINNA: My friends are
throwing me a shower today.

169
00:07:01,154 --> 00:07:03,290
They're hoping it's going to
cheer me up after the drama

170
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:04,858
last night with Isiah's family.

171
00:07:06,093 --> 00:07:07,828
- Smile!

172
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,262
- [laughter]

173
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:14,434
- [gasps] There's a fly
on it and it won't move!

174
00:07:14,535 --> 00:07:16,670
- That's gross.
- You've buried it.

175
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:19,039
- [laughter]

176
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,373
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

177
00:07:20,474 --> 00:07:22,810
- Is it hard being
away from your family?

178
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:26,046
- Yeah, 'cause my mom always
took care of me and everything.

179
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:27,815
And now I gotta
depend on Isiah.

180
00:07:27,915 --> 00:07:29,883
- Is his family acting
any better about it?

181
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:32,419
- A little bit, but not really.
- CHASITY: Does it really matter

182
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,088
since the things
they said to you?

183
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:39,660
I mean, it wouldn't matter to
me if my baby's dad's parents

184
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,262
were acting any better after
the things they said.

185
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:45,398
- I don't know.
- I wouldn't forgive them.

186
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,601
- I really don't.

187
00:07:47,701 --> 00:07:49,770
But you know,
I can't do that forever.

188
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,404
But I can now.

189
00:07:51,505 --> 00:07:55,075
- [laughs]
- Ow.

190
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:58,011
- Is she moving?
- She's, like, poking me.

191
00:07:58,111 --> 00:07:59,412
- [laughter]

192
00:07:59,513 --> 00:08:01,582
- [gasps]
Oh my goodness!

193
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:04,585
Feel it!

194
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:06,186
You have to push in
a little bit.

195
00:08:06,286 --> 00:08:07,555
Do you feel her?

196
00:08:09,823 --> 00:08:11,058
- CHRISTINNA: We're
having a girl,

197
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:13,493
and we're naming her Destiny.

198
00:08:13,594 --> 00:08:15,328
Isiah and I are
on my way to the doctor's

199
00:08:15,428 --> 00:08:17,831
for my 32-week checkup.

200
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,967
With the way I was
treated last night,

201
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:24,337
it's clear to me we're going to
have to get a place of our own.

202
00:08:24,437 --> 00:08:26,774
Every extra penny needs
to go to our apartment,

203
00:08:26,874 --> 00:08:28,308
but Isiah's sitting there
thinking about

204
00:08:28,408 --> 00:08:30,678
a new exhaust system.

205
00:08:30,778 --> 00:08:33,413
But you can't
get pipes on your car.

206
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:35,983
- Why can't I?
- It's, like, a waste of money.

207
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:38,518
- To you it is.
- What do you need pipes for?

208
00:08:38,619 --> 00:08:40,621
- Personal enjoyment.
- That's ridiculous.

209
00:08:40,721 --> 00:08:42,956
- Pleasure.
- That is selfish.

210
00:08:43,056 --> 00:08:44,558
- You think everything's stupid

211
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:46,126
if it has nothing
to do with you.

212
00:08:46,226 --> 00:08:48,195
It's honestly stupid.

213
00:08:48,295 --> 00:08:50,163
- The bigger picture
is you have a baby,

214
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,865
and the baby needs
to be taken care of.

215
00:08:53,834 --> 00:08:56,003
- Cold jelly here.

216
00:08:56,103 --> 00:08:57,805
Alright, let's see.

217
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,008
- CHRISTINNA: Oh, wow.

218
00:09:02,943 --> 00:09:05,312
I'm just wondering who
she's gonna look like.

219
00:09:05,412 --> 00:09:06,780
I think she's gonna
look like Isiah

220
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,650
because they say whoever
you think about the most,

221
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:12,085
that's who your baby
will come out looking like.

222
00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:15,022
Isiah's paycheck from the
sandwich shop doesn't go far,

223
00:09:15,122 --> 00:09:18,692
and he's only left with
$50 to cover our groceries.

224
00:09:18,792 --> 00:09:22,663
I think we can buy about six
things in this store for $50.

225
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:24,898
- Okay, we got some croutons.

226
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,634
Aw, what the heck!

227
00:09:26,734 --> 00:09:28,301
That is the biggest
bottle of hot sauce

228
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:29,603
I think I've ever seen.

229
00:09:29,703 --> 00:09:31,739
- Are you keeping track of
how much all this costs?

230
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,441
- [snickers]

231
00:09:35,976 --> 00:09:37,577
- [scanner beeping]

232
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:49,422
- $2.78.

233
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,424
- ISIAH: 15...

234
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:52,760
- CHRISTINNA: This
is embarrassing.

235
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,862
We don't even have enough
money to feed two people,

236
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:56,129
let alone three.

237
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,467
- KATRINA: Look in the back.

238
00:10:00,567 --> 00:10:02,035
It should be in
the back of Sports.

239
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:04,271
- CHRISTINNA: I've been bugging
Isiah to get us out from under

240
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:07,074
his mom's roof, but he's got
to his finances in order first.

241
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:11,912
- KATRINA: If your rent is 585,
you're gonna need about $1,500.

242
00:10:12,012 --> 00:10:14,614
Hey, get an ink pen
and start marking.

243
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:18,686
- So you make how much a month?

244
00:10:18,786 --> 00:10:20,287
- ISIAH: Let's go with 900.

245
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:23,423
- 900? Are you sure?

246
00:10:23,523 --> 00:10:27,460
- ISIAH: Yeah.
- CHRISTINNA: Okay, 900 a month.

247
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,629
The one apartment was 515.

248
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:33,233
So Mr. Math Man,
what's 900 minus 515?

249
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,568
- ISIAH: We're gonna go to 485.

250
00:10:35,669 --> 00:10:37,237
I am that good at math.

251
00:10:37,337 --> 00:10:40,240
Oh, no.
It's gonna be 385.

252
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,609
- CHRISTINNA: Well, dang.
- ISIAH: 385, that's right.

253
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:43,643
- CHRISTINNA: And the utilities,

254
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:46,814
that would be, I'd say,
around $100.

255
00:10:46,914 --> 00:10:51,051
That'll leave you
with 285 to spend a month.

256
00:10:51,151 --> 00:10:54,621
- Okay, you can subtract 80 from
that, 'cause my insurance %80.

257
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:57,024
Subtract another 80 from that,

258
00:10:57,124 --> 00:10:59,092
'cause that'll probably be
my gas for the month.

259
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:02,796
- Leaves you with 125 a month.

260
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:04,564
For us to get a
decent apartment,

261
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:07,067
it's going to be a stretch.
But this place seems cool.

262
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,469
And over the phone, the realtor
said she'd work with us.

263
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:10,971
- And you said y'all
were looking

264
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:12,706
to get into an apartment
pretty quick?

265
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:14,107
- CHRISTINNA: Yes,
as soon as possible.

266
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:15,575
- TINA: Alright.

267
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,145
- That's not bad.
This really ain't bad.

268
00:11:18,245 --> 00:11:21,348
And this is 515?
- TINA: Yes, Sir.

269
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:25,485
- This really-- wow,
this is a huge closet.

270
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:27,788
- Yeah, that's
our third bedroom.

271
00:11:27,888 --> 00:11:30,623
- Oh my goodness.
- Picnic table.

272
00:11:30,724 --> 00:11:32,192
- TINA: Yeah, we've got
picnic areas

273
00:11:32,292 --> 00:11:33,693
located all over the property.

274
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:35,562
We've got a playground,
which it's gonna be a while

275
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:36,997
before you need the playground.

276
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:39,733
I mean, it's peaceful
here, it's quiet.

277
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,568
It'd be a nice place
to raise a family.

278
00:11:41,668 --> 00:11:43,336
- I like that it's quiet.

279
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:44,704
It's really nice.

280
00:11:46,239 --> 00:11:48,308
- We have a $30 application fee.

281
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:49,810
We will run the credit,

282
00:11:49,910 --> 00:11:52,612
and that also will determine
your security deposit.

283
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:58,886
Hmm.

284
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:05,425
Okay, unfortunately it
did come back denied.

285
00:12:05,525 --> 00:12:07,127
Um, is there anyone else

286
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:11,999
that would be willing
to help you out, or...

287
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:14,701
- I don't have any
family in Alabama.

288
00:12:14,802 --> 00:12:17,104
- I mean, all I can tell
you is just, you know,

289
00:12:17,204 --> 00:12:19,239
keep your head high and
try again, you know?

290
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:22,042
Just see if you can get some
help, and then come back,

291
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:24,477
and we will do anything
we can to help you out.

292
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,746
Y'all have a great day.
- You, too.

293
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:31,618
- Well, we back on--
back looking again.

294
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:37,224
- * Looking for
the great escape *

295
00:12:37,324 --> 00:12:39,226
- CHRISTINNA: Just because
we're going to be parents,

296
00:12:39,326 --> 00:12:40,994
everyone expects
us to be adults.

297
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,831
But the reality is
we're still kids.

298
00:12:43,931 --> 00:12:45,665
How are we supposed
to become a family

299
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:47,801
if we can't even
get our own place?

300
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:56,810
- *

301
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:58,478
- CHRISTINNA: I'm finishing
up all my classes,

302
00:12:58,578 --> 00:13:00,347
and it's just in time,

303
00:13:00,447 --> 00:13:02,382
because with my baby due
in less than a month,

304
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:04,451
my head is no
longer here in school.

305
00:13:04,551 --> 00:13:06,453
- "100 Questions
About Your Pregnancy."

306
00:13:06,553 --> 00:13:08,155
- Look at that.
- Um, "Nipples...

307
00:13:08,255 --> 00:13:11,691
"Tenderness is a very common
early sign of pregnancy,

308
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,227
"and may occur
in 80% to 90% of women

309
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:16,729
as early as five to six weeks."
- That was very true.

310
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,099
- What if you have
to have a C-section?

311
00:13:19,199 --> 00:13:20,700
- Yeah, you'd have a nasty scar.

312
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,502
- When babies are born
that need a C-section,

313
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:23,803
you can't hold them
until after they

314
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:25,205
stitch you back
up and everything.

315
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:27,841
You just get to look at them.
I'd want to hold my baby.

316
00:13:27,941 --> 00:13:28,976
"Circumcision."

317
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:31,444
- Are you gonna get
your baby circumcised?

318
00:13:31,544 --> 00:13:33,513
- It's a girl.
- Yeah-- but it's a girl.

319
00:13:33,613 --> 00:13:35,648
- [laughter]

320
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:41,021
- *

321
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:42,956
- CHRISTINNA: I want
to breastfeed Destiny.

322
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:45,959
It's healthier for her, not
to mention that it's free.

323
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:47,727
- * Lactation!

324
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,729
- CHRISTINNA: My doctor
recommended I take a class.

325
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,732
- Hey, what's lactation?
Do you really know?

326
00:13:55,068 --> 00:13:57,837
- It has to do with milk, so
I'm assuming breastfeeding.

327
00:13:57,938 --> 00:14:01,708
- *

328
00:14:01,808 --> 00:14:04,744
- GLENNI: So let's look at
the positions for nursing.

329
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,014
This is the football hold.

330
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:09,116
Tuck her little arm
around your waist,

331
00:14:09,216 --> 00:14:12,652
and you bring baby up
and on to the breast.

332
00:14:12,752 --> 00:14:14,821
But we're gonna just try
the three basic positions.

333
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:17,524
So the first one, the
cradle hold like this.

334
00:14:17,624 --> 00:14:20,127
And this arm supporting
your breast, thumb on top,

335
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:22,862
fingers below.
See how much control you've got?

336
00:14:22,963 --> 00:14:24,764
It feels real
secure, doesn't it?

337
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:26,099
- Yeah.

338
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,268
- GLENNI: How much time
are you gonna have off?

339
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,470
Are you wanting to get back
right when school starts?

340
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:31,939
- Whatever they'll let me do.

341
00:14:32,039 --> 00:14:33,706
- GLENNI: Alright, you
are going back to school,

342
00:14:33,806 --> 00:14:36,643
so you are gonna be pumping
at school, probably.

343
00:14:36,743 --> 00:14:38,878
If you're wanting to breastfeed
and go back to school,

344
00:14:38,979 --> 00:14:41,314
one of the best things that
you can invest in probably

345
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:42,715
is a decent breast pump.

346
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:44,684
Looks like a backpack.

347
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:47,387
And what we can do is talk
to your school counselor,

348
00:14:47,487 --> 00:14:50,257
and I'd be happy
to intervene here

349
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:52,392
and do anything I can to help.

350
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:54,694
Very good.
I've got a bra box up front.

351
00:14:54,794 --> 00:14:56,796
I'll measure you, and then
you get to go through the box

352
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:58,565
and you can pick out two bras.

353
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:03,036
We've got several over here.

354
00:15:03,136 --> 00:15:04,604
- Looks way too big.

355
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:06,806
- [crickets chirping]

356
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:09,142
- Did y'all miss me?
- No, we did not miss you.

357
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:12,712
- CHRISTINNA: Isiah's twin
sister's visiting from college.

358
00:15:12,812 --> 00:15:15,082
We had big plans to go off
and room together

359
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:17,217
before I got pregnant.

360
00:15:17,317 --> 00:15:19,852
It depresses me to know
I should be at school with her

361
00:15:19,953 --> 00:15:22,222
instead of being here,
studying lactation.

362
00:15:22,322 --> 00:15:24,591
- We had planned this.
You were gonna go to A&M.

363
00:15:24,691 --> 00:15:26,726
We were gonna stay in the
same dorm and everything.

364
00:15:26,826 --> 00:15:29,396
When you got pregnant, you
couldn't do that no more.

365
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:32,199
I mean, I like my roommate now,
but I wish you were my roommate.

366
00:15:32,299 --> 00:15:33,366
- [laughs]

367
00:15:33,466 --> 00:15:34,867
- [door shuts]
- Where he going?

368
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:36,636
- It's a good question.

369
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,038
- How much for the speakers?

370
00:15:38,138 --> 00:15:40,307
- Uh, what did we say?
Like, 380?

371
00:15:40,407 --> 00:15:42,309
Alright.
- Cool.

372
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:43,977
- Alright, man.
Take it easy.

373
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:45,245
- You, too.

374
00:15:45,345 --> 00:15:46,413
- [door opens]

375
00:15:46,513 --> 00:15:48,048
- Who was that?
Who was that?

376
00:15:48,148 --> 00:15:49,016
- ISIAH: Boy.

377
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:49,816
- Huh?
- Boy.

378
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:50,984
- Who was that?
- Boy.

379
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:52,785
- Jason. You just gave
Jason the money.

380
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,488
- I don't have any money.
I got all the money I got.

381
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:57,190
- What did you do?
- I'm doing something.

382
00:15:58,625 --> 00:15:59,826
- Mm-hmm.
- Doing what?

383
00:15:59,926 --> 00:16:01,228
- He's doing something
to my system.

384
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:02,429
- CHRISTINNA: What?

385
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:03,596
- ISIAH: Something
to my system.

386
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,498
- What is he doing
to your system?

387
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:06,833
- ISIAH: He's
hooking something up.

388
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,501
- Why don't you just tell me

389
00:16:08,601 --> 00:16:10,003
so I'll stop asking
all these questions?

390
00:16:10,103 --> 00:16:12,239
See, Isiah has $300
left from his check,

391
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:16,076
and he wants to spend when we
gotta buy all this baby stuff.

392
00:16:16,176 --> 00:16:18,278
It's, like, a month left 'till
the baby's about to be born.

393
00:16:18,378 --> 00:16:21,548
Isiah don't give a damn
about nobody but himself.

394
00:16:21,648 --> 00:16:23,916
I'm going to be a single mother.

395
00:16:24,017 --> 00:16:25,852
- There's a lot
of hostility here.

396
00:16:25,952 --> 00:16:30,623
- *

397
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,692
- Where are my keys at?
You put it in, Jason?

398
00:16:32,792 --> 00:16:34,094
- Yeah, yeah.

399
00:16:36,496 --> 00:16:37,597
- Oh, gosh.

400
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:39,366
I'm about to wake some
people up at night.

401
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:56,849
- CHRISTINNA: Finding out
Isiah took the money

402
00:16:56,949 --> 00:16:58,151
we were supposed to be saving

403
00:16:58,251 --> 00:17:00,320
and blew it on
speakers for his car

404
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:03,290
really makes me want to
rethink this marriage.

405
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:06,293
After last night, I needed to
get out of Isiah's mom's house

406
00:17:06,393 --> 00:17:07,727
and clear my head.

407
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:09,796
- I mean, you used to be happy.

408
00:17:09,896 --> 00:17:11,564
It isn't a child
that'll make you happy.

409
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:13,633
You're eight months
pregnant right now.

410
00:17:13,733 --> 00:17:15,368
And I love Isiah to death.

411
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:20,540
But he really needs to, like,
get his priorities in order

412
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,443
because you have no
family down here.

413
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:24,611
- Exactly!

414
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:25,912
- CHASITY: Like,
he is your husband.

415
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:27,514
He's the only person.

416
00:17:27,614 --> 00:17:29,782
- CHRISTINNA: And now I'm, like,
completely dependent on him,

417
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,684
and he's not taking
care of me in any way.

418
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:33,853
I mean, I'm not saying
he has to, like,

419
00:17:33,953 --> 00:17:36,323
pay for me all the time, get
my hair did, my nails done,

420
00:17:36,423 --> 00:17:37,357
and all that stuff.

421
00:17:37,457 --> 00:17:38,925
But he's supposed
to take care of me.

422
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:40,760
Like, if I wasn't pregnant,
I would just been like,

423
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:42,362
adios, bye, I'll see you later!

424
00:17:42,462 --> 00:17:44,531
- Are you gonna try to
make it work for Destiny?

425
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:46,133
- I really don't even know.

426
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:49,035
'Cause, like, I don't believe
in getting divorced at all.

427
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:51,037
- I mean, you don't
want to get a divorce,

428
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:53,840
but it's the rest of your life.
- Exactly.

429
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,209
I can't just throw
my whole life away.

430
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:58,878
And I don't want me being
miserable to affect my daughter.

431
00:17:58,978 --> 00:18:00,347
And then she's
gonna be miserable.

432
00:18:00,447 --> 00:18:01,814
I don't know what to do.

433
00:18:01,914 --> 00:18:03,316
Whatever I'm going to do,

434
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:06,186
Isiah's going to have
to be a part of it somehow.

435
00:18:06,286 --> 00:18:09,422
He's Destiny's father,
and now he's my husband.

436
00:18:09,522 --> 00:18:10,923
No matter how mad I am,

437
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:14,427
we have to sit down and
discuss this like grownups.

438
00:18:14,527 --> 00:18:15,895
You know what I'm saying?

439
00:18:15,995 --> 00:18:18,030
I just want to understand how
you think you can afford

440
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:21,734
to spend money on speakers
when there's...

441
00:18:21,834 --> 00:18:23,069
so much stuff we gotta buy.

442
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,205
If you'd rather spend
your money however you want,

443
00:18:25,305 --> 00:18:27,374
on whatever you want, you
just need to tell me that.

444
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:30,577
- ISIAH: I just feel like
you're sitting back and relaxing

445
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:32,912
and pointing the
finger and criticizing.

446
00:18:33,012 --> 00:18:34,847
Look, I would understand,
like, if you were working

447
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,416
and doing the
same thing I'm doing,

448
00:18:36,516 --> 00:18:39,619
then it'd be a better argument.
- What do you mean?

449
00:18:39,719 --> 00:18:41,521
- My girl, she out there trying,

450
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:43,156
so I need to start
trying harder.

451
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:44,857
- But the way it is right now

452
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,827
is you're the one
with a job and I don't.

453
00:18:47,927 --> 00:18:50,630
You have a problem
with taking care of me.

454
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,065
And basically right now, I
need you to take care of me.

455
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,702
If you don't want to do that,
then I don't need to be here.

456
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:57,537
- I don't have a problem
taking care of you.

457
00:18:57,637 --> 00:19:01,708
- CHRISTINNA: You do, because
you don't want to do nothing.

458
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,643
- You're always just
talking about leaving,

459
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,077
so what do you going to do?

460
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:08,014
- I'm saying I'm not
about to stay here and...

461
00:19:08,114 --> 00:19:09,916
have to live like this--

462
00:19:10,016 --> 00:19:12,151
- Hold on, this is
so bad, isn't it?

463
00:19:12,252 --> 00:19:13,253
What's up?

464
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:25,198
The fact that she, your
daughter, your baby,

465
00:19:25,298 --> 00:19:28,167
should be your number one
priority, and she's not,

466
00:19:28,268 --> 00:19:30,002
and that's what worries me.

467
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:34,474
- *

468
00:19:34,574 --> 00:19:36,309
- CHRISTINNA: If Isiah
doesn't come around

469
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:37,544
and see things my way,

470
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:40,112
I'm going to have to
start looking at my options.

471
00:19:45,318 --> 00:19:48,788
- *

472
00:19:48,888 --> 00:19:50,290
- CHRISTINNA: As our
due date gets closer,

473
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:53,125
Isiah seems like he's getting
serious about taking care of me

474
00:19:53,226 --> 00:19:54,294
and the baby.

475
00:19:54,394 --> 00:19:55,728
Do you feel like
you're going to

476
00:19:55,828 --> 00:19:58,865
take your responsibility
more serious?

477
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:03,970
- I know really wasn't, like,
doing all I could, of course.

478
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:08,107
I was, like-- I was being 50%.
I wasn't being 100.

479
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,376
I'm 100 now.

480
00:20:09,476 --> 00:20:10,910
No, I take that back.
I'm twice.

481
00:20:11,010 --> 00:20:14,547
I'm twice as ready.
I'm about 151, 200 now.

482
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:17,750
- CHRISTINNA: Isiah meant it.

483
00:20:17,850 --> 00:20:19,552
He went out
and found us an apartment

484
00:20:19,652 --> 00:20:21,721
where they are more
understanding of our finances.

485
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:23,723
- We don't do a
credit check here.

486
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:26,293
We just need a proof of
income, and it'll be fine.

487
00:20:26,393 --> 00:20:28,595
- CHRISTINNA: It might not be
everything I was looking for,

488
00:20:28,695 --> 00:20:31,097
but it sets me free from
Isiah's family's house,

489
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:32,699
and that's all I care about.

490
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:36,369
- *

491
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:37,570
- CHRISTINNA: Well, dang!

492
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,038
Who squished my lamp?

493
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:43,576
- *

494
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:44,877
- You ready to go?

495
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:53,653
- *

496
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:56,456
- [grunts]
- CHRISTINNA: It feels good

497
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:58,825
to know Isiah and I
are making a fresh start.

498
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:01,528
And he got us into our
new place just in time,

499
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:04,030
because my due date
is a week away.

500
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:08,267
- *

501
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:10,437
- CHRISTINNA: We're going in
for what's supposed to be

502
00:21:10,537 --> 00:21:13,039
my last doctor's visit
before I deliver Destiny.

503
00:21:13,139 --> 00:21:14,607
- Hello!

504
00:21:14,707 --> 00:21:16,976
- CHRISTINNA: After my checkup,
Dr. Carlota decided

505
00:21:17,076 --> 00:21:19,846
we are potentially three days
away from delivery.

506
00:21:19,946 --> 00:21:21,714
- He'll be home
before Christmas.

507
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,851
- WOMAN: Y'all have
a good Christmas.

508
00:21:24,951 --> 00:21:25,918
- You, too.

509
00:21:27,019 --> 00:21:28,855
- *

510
00:21:28,955 --> 00:21:30,890
- KATRINA: Christinna,
we have an appointment!

511
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:33,726
Isiah, you're gonna be late
for your own child's birth.

512
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:34,661
Let's go.

513
00:21:34,761 --> 00:21:35,762
- CHRISTINNA:
Isiah's mom and I

514
00:21:35,862 --> 00:21:37,364
put aside the tension
between us.

515
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:39,599
She wants to be there
for Destiny's birth.

516
00:21:39,699 --> 00:21:42,569
- I need a-- I need a--
I misplaced my car keys.

517
00:21:42,669 --> 00:21:44,571
- CHRISTINNA; Isiah
is as nervous as hell.

518
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:46,406
- Do you have the baby bag?

519
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:48,708
- ISIAH: I knew
she had found you.

520
00:21:48,808 --> 00:21:50,610
Where are my car keys at?

521
00:21:52,379 --> 00:21:54,246
- Hurry up.
We'll be late.

522
00:21:54,347 --> 00:21:55,548
- Hold on.

523
00:21:57,350 --> 00:22:00,086
- CHRISTINNA: I thought I'd
be freaking out a lot more,

524
00:22:00,186 --> 00:22:02,822
but I'm actually just
excited to meet my baby.

525
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:07,860
- Alright, you ready?

526
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:13,533
When you get your Pitocin
started, it has to, like,

527
00:22:13,633 --> 00:22:15,201
drip into this, you know?

528
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,071
- CHRISTINNA: It took a few
hours for the contractions

529
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:22,442
to start, and it was the most
pain I've ever experience.

530
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:24,944
[groans]

531
00:22:33,486 --> 00:22:36,122
My contractions came on strong.

532
00:22:36,222 --> 00:22:38,858
[groans]

533
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:43,295
[breathes deeply]

534
00:22:46,265 --> 00:22:48,000
[moans]

535
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,737
The pain was so bad,
I had to get an epidural.

536
00:22:50,837 --> 00:22:52,972
And now I'm in kind of a haze.

537
00:22:57,143 --> 00:22:58,845
- You feeling better
with that epidural?

538
00:22:59,712 --> 00:23:01,047
Okay, good.

539
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:03,750
We are 5 centimeters dilated
and about 80% thinned out.

540
00:23:03,850 --> 00:23:06,018
That's pretty good.
The baby's coming down.

541
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:07,754
- CHRISTINNA: After a
whole day of waiting,

542
00:23:07,854 --> 00:23:10,322
I was finally dilated
enough to start pushing.

543
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:11,858
- NURSE: You feel it? Okay.

544
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:16,663
- Push, one, two,
three, four,

545
00:23:16,763 --> 00:23:22,101
five, six, seven,
eight, nine, ten.

546
00:23:22,201 --> 00:23:23,402
All into your bottom.

547
00:23:23,503 --> 00:23:26,906
Push, seven, eight, nine.

548
00:23:27,006 --> 00:23:30,042
Quick breath, and push again.

549
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:33,012
- DR. CARLOTA: It's not moving.
- Did you say it wasn't moving?

550
00:23:33,112 --> 00:23:35,582
- Well, it comes down a little,
then comes right back up.

551
00:23:35,682 --> 00:23:37,984
It's not-- it hasn't
moved much yet.

552
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,652
- And grab.

553
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:41,287
Keep it going.

554
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:43,456
Keep it going, you got it.

555
00:23:43,556 --> 00:23:45,625
Keep going, keep going.
Keep it going.

556
00:23:45,725 --> 00:23:46,993
Keep it going.

557
00:23:47,093 --> 00:23:51,030
- NURSES: Seven,
eight, nine, ten.

558
00:23:51,130 --> 00:23:53,533
- Are you able to
feel anything yet?

559
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:55,935
- DR. CARLOTA: If it's
not coming this way,

560
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:58,337
you know which way we
might have to get the baby.

561
00:24:00,707 --> 00:24:03,876
It's okay.
It's not failure or anything.

562
00:24:03,976 --> 00:24:06,345
You're doing fine.
The baby's doing fine.

563
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,915
These things, we just never
know until we're here.

564
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,556
- CHRISTINNA: After
pushing for over an hour,

565
00:24:16,656 --> 00:24:18,224
the doctor knew I was exhausted,

566
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:20,860
and was trying to prepare me
for a C-section.

567
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,295
But I'm going to fight
as hard as I can

568
00:24:23,395 --> 00:24:26,265
before I even consider that.

569
00:24:26,365 --> 00:24:27,700
- Push hard.

570
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:31,704
Two, three, four, five,

571
00:24:31,804 --> 00:24:36,909
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

572
00:24:38,044 --> 00:24:39,946
- CHRISTINNA: But it
just wasn't working.

573
00:24:42,815 --> 00:24:44,216
- NURSE: I know.

574
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:48,721
- *

575
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:55,294
- NURSE: Come on, go, push!

576
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:57,063
Don't hurt your back.
Curl up over that baby.

577
00:24:57,163 --> 00:24:59,298
Curl up just like that.
Push, push, push...

578
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:01,333
- CHRISTINNA: Even though
I'm totally exhausted,

579
00:25:01,433 --> 00:25:04,436
I wanted to give it one last
shot before they cut me open.

580
00:25:04,537 --> 00:25:06,072
- NURSE: Do it again
just like that.

581
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:08,340
Push, push, push.
Go, go, go, go, go.

582
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,843
Come on, push it, push it,
push it, push it, push it.

583
00:25:10,943 --> 00:25:13,479
- [pants]

584
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,447
- Show him how good
you've been pushing for me.

585
00:25:15,548 --> 00:25:16,583
Come on, push!

586
00:25:16,683 --> 00:25:17,984
- DR. CARLOTA: Go ahead.

587
00:25:18,084 --> 00:25:19,986
- Give it all you got.

588
00:25:20,086 --> 00:25:22,188
- Where are we at?
- Right there.

589
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:23,956
Is that where it
was or is it lower?

590
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:25,658
- DR. CARLOTA: I'd
just leave it--

591
00:25:25,758 --> 00:25:26,993
- [moans]

592
00:25:27,093 --> 00:25:28,595
- NURSE: Can we give
her something for pain?

593
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:30,897
'Cause she can't push.
She's having a hard time.

594
00:25:30,997 --> 00:25:32,832
- CHRISTINNA: I was totally
against having a C-section.

595
00:25:32,932 --> 00:25:37,203
But after 26 hours of labor, I
feel like it's my only option.

596
00:25:38,971 --> 00:25:40,406
- Come on, Isiah.

597
00:25:40,506 --> 00:25:50,116
- *

598
00:25:52,952 --> 00:25:54,386
- There she is.

599
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:56,656
- CHRISTINNA: Aww!
- Keep smiling.

600
00:25:56,756 --> 00:25:59,125
- NURSE: Congratulations!

601
00:25:59,225 --> 00:26:01,060
- NURSE: You're a pretty
little Christmas baby.

602
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,494
She has not cried.

603
00:26:02,595 --> 00:26:04,664
Say, "I'm not a crier!"
Alright!

604
00:26:04,764 --> 00:26:07,299
Little Miss Destiny's
going to see Mama!

605
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:09,368
- ISIAH: Say hi, Mom.

606
00:26:11,503 --> 00:26:13,973
Man, who does it?
Who does it all the time?

607
00:26:14,073 --> 00:26:15,642
That's me.

608
00:26:17,977 --> 00:26:19,245
- Feel good?

609
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,686
- [laughter]

610
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:27,887
- DESTINY: [cries]

611
00:26:27,987 --> 00:26:35,194
- *

612
00:26:36,428 --> 00:26:40,900
- *

613
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,435
- CHRISTINNA: I'm doing the
first diaper change on my own.

614
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:46,138
This is all going to
be a learning process.

615
00:26:46,238 --> 00:26:48,574
It's good Destiny looks
like a patient baby.

616
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,645
Now that I'm on my feet,

617
00:26:52,745 --> 00:26:55,514
I'm reminded that
I just had major surgery.

618
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:59,385
- *

619
00:26:59,485 --> 00:27:01,688
- Okay, there it
is, there it is.

620
00:27:13,432 --> 00:27:15,101
Tired of being locked
up, aren't you?

621
00:27:15,201 --> 00:27:17,770
Don't cry. Oh!

622
00:27:17,870 --> 00:27:20,172
- CHRISTINNA: Along with
nervousness and exhaustion,

623
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:22,174
I'm in a daze from
the pain meds I need

624
00:27:22,274 --> 00:27:23,976
for the stitches in my belly.

625
00:27:24,076 --> 00:27:25,978
Isiah is being super attentive

626
00:27:26,078 --> 00:27:28,414
and trying to help
with all he can.

627
00:27:28,514 --> 00:27:31,984
After a bathroom break and a
feeding, I can finally rest.

628
00:27:32,084 --> 00:27:34,186
- Are you tired still?
- Yeah.

629
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:36,689
- Going to bed?
- Yeah.

630
00:27:36,789 --> 00:27:38,891
- ISIAH: If she starts
crying, just yell.

631
00:27:41,728 --> 00:27:43,896
- DESTINY: [cries]

632
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,501
- CHRISTINNA: I wish I had
some guidance for this.

633
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:52,071
I don't feel comfortable calling
on Isiah's family for help,

634
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:55,541
and my mom could only be so
much help from 800 miles away.

635
00:27:57,744 --> 00:27:58,878
- [cries]

636
00:27:59,946 --> 00:28:01,547
[cries]

637
00:28:03,850 --> 00:28:06,318
[cries]

638
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:11,858
- *

639
00:28:11,958 --> 00:28:13,459
- [alarm clock beeps]

640
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:15,561
- CHRISTINNA: Isiah's
pitching in as much as he can,

641
00:28:15,661 --> 00:28:18,697
but money's tight for us,
and he has to up his hours.

642
00:28:18,798 --> 00:28:22,334
On the fourth day, he
had to go back to work.

643
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,003
Now that I'm seeing
what our lives are like

644
00:28:24,103 --> 00:28:25,404
with Destiny here,

645
00:28:25,504 --> 00:28:27,774
I'm wondering how we're
ever going to do all this

646
00:28:27,874 --> 00:28:29,942
and get back to school
like we had planned.

647
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,783
- CHASITY: Hi
there, pretty girl!

648
00:28:36,883 --> 00:28:39,218
How are things between
you and Isiah going?

649
00:28:39,318 --> 00:28:42,088
- They're going good.

650
00:28:42,188 --> 00:28:44,123
- Does he still
work a whole bunch?

651
00:28:44,223 --> 00:28:45,557
- Mm-hmm.

652
00:28:45,657 --> 00:28:48,427
- Does he help change diapers?
- Yeah.

653
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:49,829
I don't really like him
changing diapers, though,

654
00:28:49,929 --> 00:28:51,330
'cause I'd be like,
"You missed something."

655
00:28:51,430 --> 00:28:52,865
- [laughs]

656
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:54,633
- I don't know, I'm weird.

657
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,003
- Are you going to go
to school this semester?

658
00:28:57,103 --> 00:28:59,038
- Yeah, do the summer semester.

659
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:00,940
- What are y'all
goinna do with her?

660
00:29:02,942 --> 00:29:04,510
- I don't know.

661
00:29:04,610 --> 00:29:07,847
- I couldn't even imagine having
a baby and going to school.

662
00:29:07,947 --> 00:29:10,783
That'd be, like, way
too much to handle.

663
00:29:15,021 --> 00:29:17,523
- CHRISTINNA: If I'm at
school and Isiah's at work,

664
00:29:17,623 --> 00:29:19,525
there's no one to watch Destiny.

665
00:29:19,625 --> 00:29:21,460
It's starting
to make me resentful

666
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:24,096
that Isiah gets to leave the
house while I'm stuck here.

667
00:29:26,632 --> 00:29:28,000
- You like being a mom now?

668
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:30,970
- [mumbles]

669
00:29:31,070 --> 00:29:32,839
I don't like it or dislike it.

670
00:29:33,806 --> 00:29:37,009
It's not fun doing
all that crap.

671
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:40,479
It's not that bad, but it's
just not really interesting,

672
00:29:40,579 --> 00:29:44,416
unless you stay here
and take care of the baby.

673
00:29:44,516 --> 00:29:48,020
I can go to school, and
[unintelligible] all day long.

674
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,555
- [ding]

675
00:29:49,655 --> 00:29:51,623
- CHRISTINNA: I can sit and
dream about getting my degree

676
00:29:51,723 --> 00:29:54,160
and teaching inner-city kids,
but the reality is

677
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,928
I'm a full-time mom and now.

678
00:29:56,028 --> 00:29:59,065
And without help, I'm going to
have to give up school for now.

679
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:01,600
- WOMAN: You may be asked
if there's a daycare.

680
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:06,038
- Hi, I'm calling because I want
to take the semester off

681
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,606
because I just had a baby.

682
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,144
- WOMAN: Okay, Miss, can I get
your Social Security number?

683
00:30:12,244 --> 00:30:13,512
- CHRISTINNA: I had no idea

684
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:16,148
I was going to have to give up
so much to be a mom.

685
00:30:22,188 --> 00:30:24,523
- WOMAN: How old is she?
- CHRISTINNA: Two months old.

686
00:30:24,623 --> 00:30:28,127
- She's sweet! Aww!

687
00:30:29,428 --> 00:30:31,864
We do have a special today.
It's a $5 pork plate.

688
00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:33,699
- CHRISTINNA: I'm not happy
that being a mom

689
00:30:33,799 --> 00:30:35,534
is forcing me to delay college.

690
00:30:35,634 --> 00:30:37,036
Chasity is bummed, too.

691
00:30:37,136 --> 00:30:38,871
She was my best
friend in high school,

692
00:30:38,971 --> 00:30:40,272
and knows how important my goal

693
00:30:40,372 --> 00:30:42,241
of being an English teacher
is to me.

694
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:45,878
I just think the reason I wanted
to be an English teacher

695
00:30:45,978 --> 00:30:47,413
is 'cause I went to
this school in Rochester.

696
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:48,814
It was, like,
a city-city school.

697
00:30:48,915 --> 00:30:50,082
And there were so many
illiterate people,

698
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,483
it was ridiculous.

699
00:30:51,583 --> 00:30:53,452
I was like, if only my
English teacher was better,

700
00:30:53,552 --> 00:30:55,721
'cause she would just
sit around and did nothing.

701
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:56,923
- That's good.

702
00:30:57,023 --> 00:30:58,958
I mean, you want to
help other people.

703
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:02,328
- Everybody has a
purpose in life.

704
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:06,732
I didn't think my purpose
was to take care of a baby

705
00:31:06,832 --> 00:31:09,201
before I had her.

706
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:12,204
Like, that wasn't my life plan.

707
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:15,841
Like, I was born on this
earth to take care of kids.

708
00:31:15,942 --> 00:31:17,143
No.

709
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:20,212
I'm not going to
give up on my dreams.

710
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:22,481
But with Destiny, it's going
to take me longer to get

711
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:24,083
where I want to go.

712
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:29,021
Isiah's had to give up a
lot for our baby as well.

713
00:31:30,389 --> 00:31:32,724
This is the first year he hasn't
been on a football field

714
00:31:32,824 --> 00:31:34,426
since he was five years old.

715
00:31:34,526 --> 00:31:36,862
And I know that working at
a sandwich shop full time

716
00:31:36,963 --> 00:31:39,698
is not exactly fulfilling
Isiah's dreams.

717
00:31:39,798 --> 00:31:41,700
- [crowd cheering]

718
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:44,536
- * I have my chest doubled

719
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:47,339
*

720
00:31:47,439 --> 00:31:53,112
* I have my chest
falling down *

721
00:31:53,946 --> 00:31:55,047
- What's up, man?

722
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:57,049
I mean, how everything
going with the fam?

723
00:31:57,149 --> 00:31:58,517
- Finances ain't good.

724
00:31:58,617 --> 00:32:00,486
- TONY: Finances is never good.
So what's up, man?

725
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:02,354
What you thinking, man?
- I don't know, man.

726
00:32:02,454 --> 00:32:05,391
It's just a lot of decisions
I gotta make here next year.

727
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:08,127
So, the clock is running
out on a lot of stuff, man.

728
00:32:08,227 --> 00:32:10,396
I watched our
football highlight film.

729
00:32:10,496 --> 00:32:12,031
Haven't watched it in a year.

730
00:32:12,131 --> 00:32:13,899
Man, every time I
watched it, like, man,

731
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,634
I can still be that
guy on that tape.

732
00:32:15,734 --> 00:32:17,469
- Don't rely on this
football thing, dude.

733
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:19,505
- ISIAH:
I'm not gonna rely on it.

734
00:32:23,442 --> 00:32:25,644
That's the only thing
I've ever been good at.

735
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:28,180
- The football thing, that
should be in the thinking,

736
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,382
but that should be last.
You need to think about

737
00:32:30,482 --> 00:32:32,818
what you gonna do about you,
the baby, and the money for it.

738
00:32:32,918 --> 00:32:34,120
- So how did everything change

739
00:32:34,220 --> 00:32:35,821
just 'cause
she got pregnant, though?

740
00:32:35,921 --> 00:32:37,389
Really?

741
00:32:37,489 --> 00:32:39,758
I mean, what would've been worse
if I still took the scholarship?

742
00:32:39,858 --> 00:32:42,094
We probably still would've
been right where we at now.

743
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:53,272
I never saw this
for myself, man.

744
00:32:53,372 --> 00:32:55,407
- You gonna talk to Christinna
bout what you've been saying?

745
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:56,708
I mean, what you've
been talking about?

746
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:59,678
- I don't know, really.
I might and I might not.

747
00:33:01,047 --> 00:33:06,285
- *

748
00:33:06,385 --> 00:33:07,886
- Whoa!
- Oh, is it a lot?

749
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,955
- Yeah.

750
00:33:10,056 --> 00:33:13,059
- CHRISTINNA: Oh, gosh.
Lift up her foot.

751
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:16,728
- It went right up the diaper.
- Really?

752
00:33:16,828 --> 00:33:18,430
- Are you using all the wipes?

753
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,366
Gosh, these things aren't free.

754
00:33:20,466 --> 00:33:22,301
I sense something's
bugging Isiah.

755
00:33:22,401 --> 00:33:24,903
And even when we do get
a rare moment alone,

756
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:26,372
we aren't really talking.

757
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:31,577
- *

758
00:33:31,677 --> 00:33:33,845
- CHRISTINNA: Most of
the day, Isiah works,

759
00:33:33,945 --> 00:33:36,282
and Destiny and
I are on our own.

760
00:33:36,382 --> 00:33:38,250
When he does get free time,

761
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,852
he's been spending more
of it at his mom's house.

762
00:33:40,952 --> 00:33:44,590
They all love Destiny, but I
don't exactly feel welcome.

763
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:46,625
But tonight, after
he gets off of work,

764
00:33:46,725 --> 00:33:48,827
I'm meeting him over
there for dinner.

765
00:33:48,927 --> 00:33:51,063
It's the first time
we're all getting together

766
00:33:51,163 --> 00:33:52,664
since Destiny was born,

767
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:55,134
and I'm trying
not to be nervous about it.

768
00:33:55,234 --> 00:33:57,603
- When you off this week?
- Thursday.

769
00:33:57,703 --> 00:33:58,604
- What's wrong with you?

770
00:33:58,704 --> 00:33:59,705
- [mutters]

771
00:33:59,805 --> 00:34:01,006
- He's frustrated.
- I'm not frustrated.

772
00:34:01,107 --> 00:34:02,341
- I can tell!

773
00:34:02,441 --> 00:34:04,743
- Get on top of the situation?

774
00:34:04,843 --> 00:34:06,145
- I know.

775
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:08,880
If I just say forget it
and walk away, I mean,

776
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,550
what was the hell my purpose
of staying here, you know?

777
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:13,919
Giving up my scholarship if I'm
just gonna walk away that easy.

778
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:15,787
I at least
wanted to give it a shot

779
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:17,189
with me, her, and the baby.

780
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:20,226
- I feel like you could
be there for the baby.

781
00:34:20,326 --> 00:34:22,328
You don't have to
be there for her.

782
00:34:22,428 --> 00:34:24,530
- KATRINA: I feel
she'll make that difficult.

783
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:27,133
- I feel we still
should have a DNA test.

784
00:34:27,233 --> 00:34:30,636
She knows that she's
the baby momma for sure.

785
00:34:32,104 --> 00:34:35,441
But there's always a doubt
there, and we all know that.

786
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:37,209
- Come to find out
it ain't yours,

787
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:39,044
then you've been going
through this for no reason.

788
00:34:39,145 --> 00:34:41,813
Then I would be mad.
- Get that over with,

789
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,282
'cause if that ain't yours,

790
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:44,716
it's gonna be some
rumble in the jungle.

791
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:48,053
When Christinna and I was
arguing a long time ago,

792
00:34:48,154 --> 00:34:50,122
she told me, "Soon
as the baby's born,

793
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:52,658
"I'm gonna get a DNA test and
I'm gonna bring it over there

794
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:56,462
and slap you in the face."
I'm still waiting for that slap.

795
00:34:56,562 --> 00:34:59,531
I've been waiting on that
slap since December 22,

796
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:01,633
'cause I wanna know, you
know what I'm saying?

797
00:35:01,733 --> 00:35:03,735
And you wanna know.
Stop playing.

798
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:05,904
- 39.99 at the drugstore.

799
00:35:06,004 --> 00:35:08,039
One swab on your cheek,
one swap on her cheek.

800
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:09,408
Then we all know.
That's it.

801
00:35:09,508 --> 00:35:11,543
Yes, I want to do this.
No, I don't.

802
00:35:11,643 --> 00:35:13,779
- KATHY: You ain't scared?
- ISIAH: Of what?

803
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:14,946
- I got your back.

804
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,982
- I mean, really, it's
not gonna hurt anything.

805
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:18,717
- Alright, I'll just go get it.

806
00:35:30,529 --> 00:35:32,631
- *

807
00:35:32,731 --> 00:35:33,832
- [crickets chirping]

808
00:35:33,932 --> 00:35:35,267
- CHRISTINNA: When we
sat down for dinner,

809
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:37,536
I was starting to wish
I hadn't come at all.

810
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,905
Last time Isiah's grandma
and I had dinner together,

811
00:35:40,005 --> 00:35:41,740
it didn't go so well.

812
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,875
I had a bad feeling
about coming this time,

813
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:46,044
and now I'm wishing I hadn't.

814
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,247
- The only thing that's
bothering me

815
00:35:48,347 --> 00:35:52,150
is Christinna told me,
when we were arguing,

816
00:35:52,251 --> 00:35:54,085
she said she was
gonna get a DNA test,

817
00:35:54,186 --> 00:35:56,555
and she's gonna come over and
slap me in the face with it.

818
00:35:56,655 --> 00:35:58,757
And I haven't got that.

819
00:35:58,857 --> 00:36:00,992
How come y'all haven't
posted that on my door?

820
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:04,263
Or does that not matter anymore?
- It don't matter to me.

821
00:36:04,363 --> 00:36:05,897
- KATHY: No, it
don't matter to you.

822
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,299
You already know it's your baby.

823
00:36:07,399 --> 00:36:08,800
- CHRISTINNA: I
know it's his baby.

824
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,736
- You were going
to do that for me.

825
00:36:10,836 --> 00:36:13,305
You said that.
- I know.

826
00:36:13,405 --> 00:36:14,873
- Can we do it?

827
00:36:14,973 --> 00:36:16,242
- CHRISTINNA: I don't
see the point.

828
00:36:16,342 --> 00:36:17,276
- KATHY: Why?

829
00:36:17,376 --> 00:36:19,311
- CHRISTINNA: Because
I don't want to.

830
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:20,646
I know whose baby it is,

831
00:36:20,746 --> 00:36:22,113
and that's all
that's important to me.

832
00:36:22,214 --> 00:36:24,916
There's no possible way it
could be anybody else's baby.

833
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:28,920
- You know that beyond
a shadow of a doubt.

834
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,889
Just saying, we would
like to know that, too.

835
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:32,324
- I mean, that's up to him.

836
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:34,526
It's not anybody else's
baby but mine and his.

837
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:37,095
If he has a doubt in his
mind, then I'll gladly do it.

838
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,231
But if he doesn't have a
problem with it, then...

839
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:41,132
- I don't want to air
out your dirty laundry--

840
00:36:41,233 --> 00:36:42,534
- There is no dirty laundry.

841
00:36:42,634 --> 00:36:44,736
I've had sex with one person,
and there's no possible way

842
00:36:44,836 --> 00:36:46,238
it could be anybody else's baby.

843
00:36:48,374 --> 00:36:50,709
- It depends on
what you call sex.

844
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:52,177
- No other man's [bleep]

845
00:36:52,278 --> 00:36:54,480
has entered my [bleep]
except for his.

846
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:58,149
If you think that
that's not his baby,

847
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,818
then have nothing
to do with her.

848
00:36:59,918 --> 00:37:01,186
I don't really care.
- That's fine.

849
00:37:01,287 --> 00:37:03,289
I don't have to have
anything to do with her.

850
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:05,491
But I do have to have
something to do with him.

851
00:37:05,591 --> 00:37:06,892
- Okay, I'm just saying.

852
00:37:06,992 --> 00:37:10,996
- It shouldn't be a big deal.
- But it is to me.

853
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:14,266
- Do you want to go on
and on, years to come,

854
00:37:14,366 --> 00:37:16,802
with this doubt
in your mind that maybe

855
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:18,804
that baby could not be mine?

856
00:37:18,904 --> 00:37:20,672
Or do you want to know?

857
00:37:20,772 --> 00:37:23,342
- ISIAH: I guess every man
could say whenever their child

858
00:37:23,442 --> 00:37:25,444
is born, they want to
know, period, though.

859
00:37:25,544 --> 00:37:27,879
There's not one man that
can probably say they don't.

860
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:30,015
- So what are you saying?

861
00:37:30,115 --> 00:37:31,717
- We can just do it.

862
00:37:31,817 --> 00:37:34,353
I mean, there really ain't no
doubt in my mind, you know?

863
00:37:34,453 --> 00:37:35,521
- DEVON: Are you sure?

864
00:37:35,621 --> 00:37:37,856
- I mean, 'cause I'm 110%.

865
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:39,658
- Well, then the test
don't matter, do it?

866
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:41,092
Is the answer no?

867
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:45,764
- Let's see what
I got in my purse.

868
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:47,132
- WOMAN: What?

869
00:37:49,368 --> 00:37:52,504
- I can't read, but
y'all gotta read it.

870
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:58,810
- *

871
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:00,346
- Well.

872
00:38:00,446 --> 00:38:01,680
Well.

873
00:38:06,652 --> 00:38:07,853
- KATHY: And I've got my answer.

874
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:09,488
I don't need a DNA test now.

875
00:38:09,588 --> 00:38:18,997
- *

876
00:38:19,097 --> 00:38:20,999
- CHRISTINNA: I've got
nothing to hide from anybody.

877
00:38:21,099 --> 00:38:23,101
I know who Destiny's father is.

878
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:25,404
But I'm not going to sit there
and let me and my daughter

879
00:38:25,504 --> 00:38:28,840
be insulted by Isiah's
crazy grandma.

880
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,642
After leaving
Isiah's mom's house,

881
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:33,779
I felt like leaving the whole
family behind me forever.

882
00:38:33,879 --> 00:38:37,483
But to leave Isiah's family
is to leave Isiah as well,

883
00:38:37,583 --> 00:38:39,951
which I don't want to do.

884
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:41,587
- [crickets chirping]

885
00:38:42,721 --> 00:38:45,424
- [birds chirping]

886
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:47,058
- CHRISTINNA:
Isiah felt really bad

887
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,560
about the way
things went that night.

888
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,062
He's made it clear to his family
that some issues

889
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,465
have to be handled
just between the two of us.

890
00:38:56,001 --> 00:38:58,269
- How do you feel?
- I asked you first.

891
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:03,008
- I think that if we both
try and we both want to work,

892
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:05,411
it'll last as long as
we both want it to.

893
00:39:05,511 --> 00:39:08,880
If we both don't try, then
we're not gonna get very far.

894
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,749
It's back to you.

895
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:13,018
Effort on both parts.

896
00:39:13,118 --> 00:39:15,253
She's eating my shoulder.

897
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:17,689
- I think as long as
both of us try, we will.

898
00:39:17,789 --> 00:39:20,225
But you know if we both try,

899
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:21,860
it's still gonna be hard,
though.

900
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,194
I can just say that.

901
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:24,963
- It's always gonna be hard...

902
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:27,298
until we're, like, 60 and old.

903
00:39:27,399 --> 00:39:30,068
- Hell, we ain't even got too
much stuff we can do but try.

904
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:32,303
And we're still here.

905
00:39:32,404 --> 00:39:33,672
- Yeah.

906
00:39:33,772 --> 00:39:38,544
- *

907
00:39:38,644 --> 00:39:40,378
- CHRISTINNA: Getting pregnant
at such a young age

908
00:39:40,479 --> 00:39:41,980
was difficult.

909
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,415
It brought a lot
of extra stress.

910
00:39:43,515 --> 00:39:45,183
You have to worry about
a lot more things

911
00:39:45,283 --> 00:39:48,053
that you usually
wouldn't have to worry about

912
00:39:48,153 --> 00:39:51,122
if you were just a normal,
typical teenage girl.

913
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:52,924
I think Isiah's
family blames me

914
00:39:53,024 --> 00:39:55,226
for him not taking
his scholarship.

915
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:58,664
If I was a mother and my
son got a girl pregnant,

916
00:39:58,764 --> 00:40:01,733
and he had a scholarship to
go play college football,

917
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:04,402
I'd probably feel
resentful, too.

918
00:40:04,503 --> 00:40:07,005
- That's the one.
You was, like, two months.

919
00:40:07,105 --> 00:40:09,107
- ISIAH: This is her
when she was two months.

920
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:10,776
Same eyes, same nose.

921
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:13,278
- CHRISTINNA: If Isiah wants a
paternity test, he can have one.

922
00:40:13,378 --> 00:40:15,714
I just feel that's something
for me and him

923
00:40:15,814 --> 00:40:18,550
to deal with and decide on.

924
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,385
And if he wanted one,
he should've been a man

925
00:40:20,486 --> 00:40:22,353
and asked me for one by himself.

926
00:40:24,089 --> 00:40:25,924
I'm going to college
no matter what.

927
00:40:26,024 --> 00:40:27,425
And I'm going to
graduate no matter what,

928
00:40:27,526 --> 00:40:30,896
so I always know that I'll be
able to provide in my way

929
00:40:30,996 --> 00:40:32,998
for our family.

930
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:35,801
And Isiah can be a
stay-at-home dad.

931
00:40:35,901 --> 00:40:40,205
- Hi, mom, me.

932
00:40:40,305 --> 00:40:42,508
- CHRISTINNA: Me and Isiah's
relationship, it's okay.

933
00:40:42,608 --> 00:40:45,644
It could be a lot better, but
it could be a lot worse, too.

934
00:40:45,744 --> 00:40:47,045
If it works, that's great.

935
00:40:47,145 --> 00:40:50,816
If it doesn't work, life will
be okay, and it will go on.

- FEMALE ANNOUNCER: On the
next "16 and Pregnant."

938
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:12,103
- It makes me sad, having
to grow up sometimes.

939
00:41:12,203 --> 00:41:14,405
- [gunshot]

00:41:14,506 --> 00:41:16,842

It's really gonna be hard on me.

942
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:19,811
- What are your plans?

943
00:41:19,911 --> 00:41:22,447
Because I feel real strong
about not moving in together

944
00:41:22,548 --> 00:41:23,982
until you're married.

945
00:41:24,082 --> 00:41:25,917
- Kayla, will you marry me?

946
00:41:26,017 --> 00:41:28,219
- KAYLA: I don't want
to feel on my wedding day

947
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:30,956
that I'm getting married
because we had a baby.

948
00:41:31,056 --> 00:41:32,591
- I want to support my family.

949
00:41:32,691 --> 00:41:34,325
