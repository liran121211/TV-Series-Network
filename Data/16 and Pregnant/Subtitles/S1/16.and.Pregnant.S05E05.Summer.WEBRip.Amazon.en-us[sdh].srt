1
00:00:03,967 --> 00:00:04,967
>> THIS IS GROSS.

2
00:00:04,967 --> 00:00:05,867
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO PUT MY HAND

3
00:00:05,867 --> 00:00:07,267
IN THIS.

4
00:00:07,267 --> 00:00:09,000
HI, I'M SUMMER.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,733
I LIVE IN COLLINS, GEORGIA,

6
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:11,700
A SMALL TOWN AN HOUR

7
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,333
OUTSIDE OF SAVANNAH.

8
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:15,600
I MET MY BOYFRIEND, DJ, ONLINE,

9
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,433
AND WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR

10
00:00:16,433 --> 00:00:17,467
THREE YEARS.

11
00:00:17,467 --> 00:00:18,733
HE'S A REAL COUNTRY BOY...

12
00:00:18,733 --> 00:00:19,600
BE CAREFUL.

13
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,933
AND WE'RE TOTALLY IN LOVE.

14
00:00:21,933 --> 00:00:23,500
>> [strumming guitar]

15
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:26,433
* GIRL, I LOVE YOU

16
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:27,700
* IT'S WHY I'M WRITING *

17
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,467
* THIS SONG

18
00:00:30,467 --> 00:00:31,700
>> DJ GOT HIS G.E.D. AND IS

19
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:33,433
TAKING CLASSES TO BE A WELDER,

20
00:00:33,433 --> 00:00:34,600
AND I WANT TO GRADUATE NEXT YEAR

21
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,033
AND GET MY DIPLOMA.

22
00:00:36,033 --> 00:00:37,900
WHEN I'M NOT WITH DJ, I LOVE

23
00:00:37,900 --> 00:00:38,800
HANGING OUT WITH MY THREE

24
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,200
HALF SISTERS.

25
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,000
bang!

26
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,833
UGH, I JUST RAN OVER A SNAKE.

27
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:43,667
OH, MY GOD.

28
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:44,667
>> I DON'T LIKE THAT.

29
00:00:44,667 --> 00:00:46,267
>> AS THE OLDEST, I ALWAYS TRY

30
00:00:46,267 --> 00:00:47,667
TO LOOK OUT FOR THEM, ESPECIALLY

31
00:00:47,667 --> 00:00:48,933
BECAUSE OUR MOM STRUGGLES WITH

32
00:00:48,933 --> 00:00:51,033
ADDICTION AND HAS BEEN IN AND

33
00:00:51,033 --> 00:00:52,733
OUT OF OUR LIVES SINCE HAVING US

34
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:54,300
AS A TEENAGER.

35
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:55,800
BUT I'M HOPING I LEARN FROM HER

36
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,467
MISTAKES, BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH I

37
00:00:57,467 --> 00:01:00,100
WANT TO DO THINGS DIFFERENTLY,

38
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:02,067
I'M PREGNANT.

39
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,633
WE'RE TWO MONTHS AWAY FROM

40
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:14,233
HAVING OUR SON, PEYTON.

41
00:01:14,233 --> 00:01:15,367
SINCE MY MOM IS STRUGGLING WITH

42
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:17,400
ADDICTION, I DECIDED TO MOVE IN

43
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,733
WITH DJ'S PARENTS SO OUR SON

44
00:01:18,733 --> 00:01:20,833
WOULD HAVE A STABLE HOME.

45
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:22,067
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT VERY GOOD

46
00:01:22,067 --> 00:01:23,367
AT THIS.

47
00:01:23,367 --> 00:01:24,733
YOU GOT TO PRESS DOWN HARD

48
00:01:24,733 --> 00:01:25,967
OR SOMETHING.

49
00:01:25,967 --> 00:01:26,733
>> I AM PRESSING DOWN HARD.

50
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:27,367
>> ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

51
00:01:27,367 --> 00:01:28,233
SEE, YOU'RE LEAVING STUFF ON

52
00:01:28,233 --> 00:01:28,967
THAT.

53
00:01:28,967 --> 00:01:30,233
YOU GOT TO ROLL THAT STUFF IN.

54
00:01:30,233 --> 00:01:31,300
>> THAT'S 'CAUSE I AIN'T USING

55
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,300
A LOT OF PAINT.

56
00:01:37,533 --> 00:01:39,167
>> OH, YOU GOT IT ALL OVER THAT,

57
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:40,233
DIDN'T YOU?

58
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:41,700
I WISH Y'ALL WOULD HAVE WAITED

59
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,700
FOR ME.

60
00:01:44,833 --> 00:01:45,800
>> SEE, YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO

61
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,133
GET PAINT ON THIS.

62
00:01:47,133 --> 00:01:49,800
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE WHITE.

63
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,500
>> NO, WE'RE NOT.

64
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:51,200
>> YOU DON'T PAINT

65
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,267
EVERYTHING BLUE.

66
00:01:53,267 --> 00:01:54,700
>> DJ'S DAD WORKS OUT OF TOWN IN

67
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,233
VIRGINIA AND ONLY COMES HOME

68
00:01:56,233 --> 00:01:58,467
WHEN HE HAS TIME OFF.

69
00:01:58,467 --> 00:02:00,300
I'M REALLY GRATEFUL DJ'S PARENTS

70
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,867
ARE SO SUPPORTIVE AND THAT WE

71
00:02:01,867 --> 00:02:02,800
WILL HAVE A PLACE TO LIVE ONCE

72
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,200
THE BABY COMES.

73
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,200
>> I MEAN, I'M, LIKE, A

74
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,467
CHEERLEADER IN Y'ALL'S CORNER,

75
00:02:06,467 --> 00:02:07,967
ROOTING FOR Y'ALL TO MAKE IT.

76
00:02:07,967 --> 00:02:10,400
I MEAN, A FAT CHEERLEADER, YES,

77
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,100
BUT A CHEERLEADER NEVERTHELESS.

78
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,067
[laughs]

79
00:02:15,067 --> 00:02:16,367
>> I AM GRATEFUL THAT YOU ARE

80
00:02:16,367 --> 00:02:18,067
LETTING ME START STAYING HERE

81
00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:20,067
'CAUSE I MEAN, YOU KNOW,

82
00:02:20,067 --> 00:02:21,833
AT MAMA'S, IT'S CHAOTIC.

83
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:22,800
>> MM-HMM.

84
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,633
>> I'M JUST REALLY GRATEFUL

85
00:02:23,633 --> 00:02:25,333
THAT Y'ALL HELPED ME AND LET ME

86
00:02:25,333 --> 00:02:26,700
JUST STAY HERE, AND Y'ALL HELPED

87
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,067
ME OUT WITH EVERYTHING

88
00:02:28,067 --> 00:02:29,067
THAT I NEEDED.

89
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:30,733
>> WELL, WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT

90
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:32,067
Y'ALL WAS GONNA HAVE A CHILD,

91
00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:33,333
I WAS WORRIED.

92
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:34,700
OF COURSE, IT STRESSES ME OUT

93
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,067
AND ALL, BUT BASICALLY, IT'S

94
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:37,933
JUST BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IT'S

95
00:02:37,933 --> 00:02:39,467
JUST A BAD TIME IN Y'ALL'S LIFE

96
00:02:39,467 --> 00:02:41,067
RIGHT NOW 'CAUSE HE'S GOT TO

97
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:42,567
FINISH HIS COLLEGE, AND YOU'VE

98
00:02:42,567 --> 00:02:44,067
GOT TO FINISH YOUR SCHOOLING.

99
00:02:44,067 --> 00:02:45,500
BUT AFTER THE BABY'S BORN,

100
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,100
I EXPECT YOU TOO--PROMISE ME

101
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,600
THAT YOU'RE GONNA FINISH SCHOOL.

102
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,067
>> I AM.

103
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:53,267
>> WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING

104
00:02:53,267 --> 00:02:54,133
YOU'RE A SWEET GIRL,

105
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:55,067
'CAUSE IF YOU WASN'T,

106
00:02:55,067 --> 00:02:56,333
YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE.

107
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:59,233
[laughs]

108
00:02:59,233 --> 00:03:02,500
YOU GOT ANYTHING TO ADD TO THAT?

109
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,067
>> YOU DON'T THINK I'M SWEET?

110
00:03:04,067 --> 00:03:04,733
>> YEAH.

111
00:03:04,733 --> 00:03:06,733
[laughter]

112
00:03:11,467 --> 00:03:12,900
>> HEY.

113
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,100
>> I HATE MATH.

114
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,300
I HATE IT.

115
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,567
>> IT'S SO HARD.

116
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:17,300
>> I KIND OF MISS GOING

117
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,133
TO SCHOOL.

118
00:03:18,133 --> 00:03:18,867
>> DO YOU MISS TALKING TO

119
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:19,467
EVERYBODY?

120
00:03:19,467 --> 00:03:20,267
>> YEAH.

121
00:03:20,267 --> 00:03:21,167
BEING IN THE COMMONS AREA

122
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,467
WITH EVERYBODY AT BREAK

123
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:24,367
AND ALL THAT STUFF.

124
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:25,633
>> SO YOU CAN'T GO BACK UNTIL

125
00:03:25,633 --> 00:03:26,567
PEYTON'S BORN?

126
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:27,400
>> YEAH.

127
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:28,500
I MEAN, IT'LL BE LIKE, JANUARY,

128
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,833
'CAUSE WE HAD A SCARE.

129
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,067
THE DOCTOR RECOMMENDED THAT I GO

130
00:03:32,067 --> 00:03:33,900
AHEAD AND START MY HOSPITAL

131
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,067
HOMEBOUND.

132
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:35,967
THAT WAY, I WOULDN'T PUT

133
00:03:35,967 --> 00:03:37,733
SO MUCH STRESS ON THE BABY.

134
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:39,267
I GUESS I JUST DIDN'T THINK THAT

135
00:03:39,267 --> 00:03:40,800
IT COULD HAPPEN TO ME, YOU KNOW?

136
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:41,900
>> YEAH.

137
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:43,767
>> DJ AND ME, WE WERE STILL

138
00:03:43,767 --> 00:03:45,533
USING CONDOMS AND STUFF, BUT I

139
00:03:45,533 --> 00:03:48,067
JUST--I THINK WE RAN OUT

140
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:48,967
OR SOMETHING.

141
00:03:48,967 --> 00:03:49,933
WE RAN OUT,

142
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:51,767
AND WE NEVER GOT ANY MORE.

143
00:03:51,767 --> 00:03:52,967
AND THEN WE JUST STARTED BEING

144
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:54,233
REALLY CARELESS.

145
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:55,600
>> SO WHEN YOU FOUND OUT YOU

146
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,767
WERE PREGNANT, DID YOU EVER,

147
00:03:56,767 --> 00:03:59,100
LIKE, CONSIDER PUTTING PEYTON UP

148
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,467
FOR ADOPTION OR HAVING

149
00:04:00,467 --> 00:04:01,300
AN ABORTION?

150
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,633
>> NO, NO ABORTION.

151
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:04,933
I NEVER EVEN THOUGHT ABOUT

152
00:04:04,933 --> 00:04:05,700
ABORTION.

153
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,567
I NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT ADOPTION

154
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:07,967
EITHER, BUT DEFINITELY NOT

155
00:04:07,967 --> 00:04:08,867
ABORTION.

156
00:04:08,867 --> 00:04:09,933
WE DON'T BELIEVE IN THAT.

157
00:04:09,933 --> 00:04:12,800
AND I JUST--I DON'T KNOW.

158
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,367
>> I THINK YOU UNDERSTAND THAT

159
00:04:14,367 --> 00:04:15,867
IT'S GONNA BE HARD WHEN YOU HAVE

160
00:04:15,867 --> 00:04:16,900
PEYTON, BUT I DON'T THINK YOU

161
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,100
REALLY UNDERSTAND HOW HARD IT'S

162
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,533
GONNA BE.

163
00:04:20,533 --> 00:04:21,700
DO YOU THINK YOU WOULD LET YOUR

164
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,467
MAMA WATCH PEYTON?

165
00:04:24,467 --> 00:04:26,467
>> I DON'T KNOW.

166
00:04:29,733 --> 00:04:31,467
BECAUSE OF MY MOM'S ADDICTION

167
00:04:31,467 --> 00:04:32,967
PROBLEMS, OUR RELATIONSHIP IS

168
00:04:32,967 --> 00:04:34,467
REALLY HARD.

169
00:04:34,467 --> 00:04:36,067
BUT SHE SAYS SHE'S SOBER NOW,

170
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,367
AND I'M HOPING IT'S FOR GOOD.

171
00:04:38,367 --> 00:04:39,667
>> SO HOW YOU BEEN?

172
00:04:39,667 --> 00:04:40,733
>> GOOD.

173
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:41,533
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN?

174
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:42,667
>> BETTER.

175
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:43,333
>> GOOD.

176
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,333
I'M PROUD OF YOU.

177
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,933
I WANT US TO START CLEAN.

178
00:04:46,933 --> 00:04:47,867
YOU KNOW, HAVE THIS CONVERSATION

179
00:04:47,867 --> 00:04:48,600
AND GET EVERYTHING OUT OF

180
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,533
THE WAY BEFORE THE BABY'S HERE

181
00:04:49,533 --> 00:04:51,367
AND WE CAN HAVE ALL THAT

182
00:04:51,367 --> 00:04:52,167
TAKEN CARE OF.

183
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:53,200
>> I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU.

184
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,533
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU.

185
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:57,233
I'VE GOT IT DEAD SET IN MY MIND

186
00:04:57,233 --> 00:04:58,600
THAT I WANTED TO TELL YOU THIS.

187
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,067
I MEAN, YOU KNOW, YOU DO IT.

188
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:00,733
YOU STOP.

189
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:02,067
I DO IT. I STOP.

190
00:05:02,067 --> 00:05:03,767
AND, YOU KNOW, I KNEW YOU WAS

191
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:05,967
AGGRAVATED WITH ME, BUT--

192
00:05:05,967 --> 00:05:09,067
>> SPIT IT OUT, MAMA.

193
00:05:09,067 --> 00:05:10,300
>> BUT I DO WANT TO APOLOGIZE TO

194
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,067
YOU, SUMMER.

195
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:13,500
[sniffles]

196
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,733
PILLS CAN TAKE YOU DOWN A ROAD

197
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,133
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO.

198
00:05:17,133 --> 00:05:19,167
IT'S BEEN ME TELLING YOU THIS

199
00:05:19,167 --> 00:05:20,967
AND PROMISING YOU THIS AND

200
00:05:20,967 --> 00:05:22,700
GOING BACK AND DOING IT ALL.

201
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:26,067
IT'S JUST ONE BIG CIRCLE.

202
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:27,067
>> YOU JUST HAD A LOT FOR

203
00:05:27,067 --> 00:05:28,267
THE PAST MONTHS, ALWAYS HELPED

204
00:05:28,267 --> 00:05:29,567
ME, AND BEEN BASICALLY CLEAN.

205
00:05:29,567 --> 00:05:32,167
>> FOR THE PAST--ACTUALLY, I

206
00:05:32,167 --> 00:05:34,133
WROTE IT ON MY CALENDAR.

207
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:37,733
I THINK IT'S BEEN NOT QUITE

208
00:05:37,733 --> 00:05:39,533
THREE WEEKS.

209
00:05:39,533 --> 00:05:40,733
AND WHAT MADE MAMA KNOW THAT

210
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:42,200
I HAD TO GET BETTER IS BECAUSE,

211
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,067
SUMMER, I JUST DON'T HAVE

212
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:44,733
THE OPTION.

213
00:05:44,733 --> 00:05:45,600
I MEAN, I HAVE PEYTON COMING,

214
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,300
YOU KNOW?

215
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,200
AND YOU CAN'T BE A GRANDMAMA

216
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,400
NOR A MAMA IN THAT STATE OF

217
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,067
MIND, PERIOD, WHATSOEVER.

218
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:51,067
I WOULD NOT WANT TO DO ANYTHING

219
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:53,133
TO JEOPARDIZE YOU NOT LETTING

220
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:54,400
ME, YOU KNOW--I MEAN, I KNOW YOU

221
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,467
WOULD COME AND LET ME VISIT WITH

222
00:05:55,467 --> 00:05:56,567
HIM WITH YOU WITH HIM.

223
00:05:56,567 --> 00:05:57,700
BUT I KNOW YOU WOULDN'T BE,

224
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,633
LIKE, FEELING SAFE WITH MAMA

225
00:05:58,633 --> 00:05:59,433
ATTENDING TO HIM.

226
00:05:59,433 --> 00:06:00,267
>> I ALSO WANT TO SAY, WHEN

227
00:06:00,267 --> 00:06:01,233
YOU'RE MESSED UP, I JUST DON'T

228
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:03,167
WANT TO BE AROUND YOU.

229
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,967
AND IT'S NOT LIKE I, LIKE, TRY

230
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:07,100
TO COMPLETELY AVOID YOU.

231
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:08,067
IT'S JUST THAT IT MAKES YOU SO

232
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:08,733
MAD TO SEE YOU LIKE THAT,

233
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:09,333
YOU KNOW?

234
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:11,333
AND IT JUST HURT MY FEELINGS.

235
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,500
DON'T CRY, MOM.

236
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,433
YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME CRY.

237
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:15,933
[chuckles]

238
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:16,867
DON'T CRY.

239
00:06:16,867 --> 00:06:17,833
BE HAPPY.

240
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:18,667
I MEAN, YOU SHOULD BE PROUD OF

241
00:06:18,667 --> 00:06:19,933
YOURSELF.

242
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:21,900
YOU KNOW, THAT TAKES A LOT TO

243
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,100
JUST STOP DOING THAT STUFF,

244
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,800
YOU KNOW?

245
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,133
>> UH-HUH.

246
00:06:26,133 --> 00:06:27,700
BUT I'M GONNA STAND FIRM THIS

247
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,433
TIME AND STICK TO MY PROMISES.

248
00:06:29,433 --> 00:06:30,267
AND WHEN YOU NEED MAMA,

249
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:31,767
I'M GONNA BE MAMA.

250
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,500
I'M GONNA BE THERE FOR YOU.

251
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,800
I DON'T CARE OF IT'S

252
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,533
DAYLIGHT OR DARK,

253
00:06:37,533 --> 00:06:38,433
WEE HOURS OF THE MORNING,

254
00:06:38,433 --> 00:06:40,433
I DON'T CARE.

255
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,633
>> IT WAS REALLY HARD GROWING UP

256
00:06:51,633 --> 00:06:52,667
WHILE MY MOM WAS BATTLING

257
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:53,833
ADDICTION.

258
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:55,433
AND EVEN THOUGH I MOVED OUT,

259
00:06:55,433 --> 00:06:56,800
I STILL MAKE TIME TO HANG OUT

260
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,833
WITH MY SISTERS.

261
00:06:57,833 --> 00:06:59,067
[trash can clatters]

262
00:06:59,067 --> 00:07:01,933
I JUST RAN OVER THE TRASH CAN.

263
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:03,433
[laughter]

264
00:07:03,433 --> 00:07:04,133
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?

265
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:06,533
>> YES! OH, MY GOD.

266
00:07:06,533 --> 00:07:07,400
>> SUMMER.

267
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,100
>> OH, MY GOD.

268
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:09,167
I DENTED HIS TRUCK.

269
00:07:09,167 --> 00:07:11,433
>> WAS THAT ALREADY DENTED?

270
00:07:11,433 --> 00:07:13,400
>> I DON'T KNOW.

271
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,567
>> WELL, HELP ME PICK IT UP.

272
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:17,733
>> I'M PREGNANT.

273
00:07:17,733 --> 00:07:19,733
I AIN'T SUPPOSED TO LIFT STUFF.

274
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,933
>> QUIT SMACKING THAT GUM.

275
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:26,067
>> GOSH.

276
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:26,833
>> YOU WILL SPIT IT OUT.

277
00:07:26,833 --> 00:07:27,733
>> I'M GONNA BE AN AUNT.

278
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:28,667
THAT'S WEIRD.

279
00:07:28,667 --> 00:07:30,900
>> IT'S NOT EASY, Y'ALL.

280
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,833
LIKE, FOR REAL.

281
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:32,633

283
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:34,333
>> YEAH, THAT'S WHAT I WAS

284
00:07:34,333 --> 00:07:34,967
THINKING.

285
00:07:34,967 --> 00:07:35,800
>> OR Y'ALL GONNA END UP

286
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,367
PREGNANT AND FAT LIKE ME.

287
00:07:37,367 --> 00:07:38,800
>> NOT IF WE SAY NO.

288
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,200
>> AND I'M GONNA--YEAH, THAT'S

289
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,267
WHAT ME AND DJ SAID.

290
00:07:42,267 --> 00:07:43,133
>> I DON'T WANT TO GET THAT

291
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:44,067
THING IN MY ARM.

292
00:07:44,067 --> 00:07:45,067
>> I'M SCARED OF A NEEDLE.

293
00:07:45,067 --> 00:07:46,700
>> WELL, YOU SCARED OF A NEEDLE,

294
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,800
BUT YOU CAN HAVE SEX?

295
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,967
>> NO.

296
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:49,767
>> UH-HUH.

297
00:07:49,767 --> 00:07:51,567
I'M JUST SAYING.

298
00:07:51,567 --> 00:07:53,567
>> OH, WATCH THE ROAD.

299
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:57,667
>> WHY NOT?

300
00:07:57,667 --> 00:07:59,300
>> I DON'T WANT TO SAY IT.

301
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:00,367
>> TAYLOR, NOBODY'S GONNA BE

302
00:08:00,367 --> 00:08:01,433
LOOKING AT YOUR FEET.

303
00:08:01,433 --> 00:08:02,400
>> IT'S THE SMELL.

304
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,267

00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:21,900
LOOK AT MY BEAUTIFUL FEET.

00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:35,133
I'M READY FOR MY LITTLE TUMMY TO

321
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:36,433
COME BACK.

322
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:37,467
I JUST WANT TO BE A GOOD MAMA

323
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:38,733
TO PEYTON.

324
00:08:38,733 --> 00:08:40,167
I JUST WANT HIM TO KNOW THAT

325
00:08:40,167 --> 00:08:41,433
I'M ALWAYS THERE FOR HIM AND

326
00:08:41,433 --> 00:08:44,367
THAT HE CAN DEPEND ON ME.

327
00:08:44,367 --> 00:08:45,367
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE WERE

328
00:08:45,367 --> 00:08:46,933
LITTLE AND MOM WAS, LIKE,

329
00:08:46,933 --> 00:08:48,367
THE BEST MAMA, LIKE, THAT YOU

330
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:49,533
COULD ASK FOR?

331
00:08:49,533 --> 00:08:50,300
THAT'S THE KIND OF MAMA

332
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,167
I WANT TO BE.

333
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:51,967
BUT WHEN SHE STARTED ACTING

334
00:08:51,967 --> 00:08:53,167
WILD--I DON'T WANT TO BE LIKE

335
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:53,867
THAT.

336
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:56,600
THAT'S TAUGHT ME TO NOT GO CRAZY

337
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,667
WILD, YOU KNOW?

338
00:08:57,667 --> 00:08:59,067
>> MM-HMM.

339
00:08:59,067 --> 00:09:00,333
>> I HAVEN'T KNOWN MAMA TO STAY

340
00:09:00,333 --> 00:09:01,267
SOBER LIKE THAT FOR A FEW WEEKS,

341
00:09:01,267 --> 00:09:01,933
HAVE YOU?

342
00:09:01,933 --> 00:09:02,667
>> NOPE.

343
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,167
>> SHE, LIKE, AT LEAST ONCE

344
00:09:04,167 --> 00:09:05,367
A WEEK IS MESSED UP.

345
00:09:05,367 --> 00:09:07,133
LIKE, I'M SAYING I HAVEN'T SEEN

346
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:09,233
HER EVER TRY TO DO BETTER.

347
00:09:09,233 --> 00:09:10,067
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

348
00:09:10,067 --> 00:09:10,733
>> MM-HMM.

349
00:09:10,733 --> 00:09:12,067
>> SHE JUST LEFT US

350
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:12,867
WITH OUR DADDIES.

351
00:09:12,867 --> 00:09:15,867
AND THEN, SHE--SHE JUST...

352
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,067
I DON'T KNOW.

353
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:18,800
SHE DIDN'T REALLY WANT TO

354
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,767
BE A MAMA, SO...

355
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,067
>> SHE NEVER EVEN CALLED US.

356
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:22,067
>> MM-MM.

357
00:09:22,067 --> 00:09:23,233
SHE BARELY EVER CALLED.

358
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:24,833
AND WHEN SHE DID CALL, I WOULD

359
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:25,900
IGNORE IT 'CAUSE I WAS MAD

360
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,633
AT HER.

361
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:28,233
>> [laughs]

362
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:29,067
>> I DIDN'T TALK TO HER FOR,

363
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:30,800
LIKE, A YEAR.

364
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,900
>> IT WAS HARD.

365
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,167
LIKE, WHEN WE STARTED OUR

366
00:09:33,167 --> 00:09:34,367
PERIOD, MAMA WASN'T THERE.

367
00:09:34,367 --> 00:09:35,333
LIKE, YOU KNOW, LIKE, DADDY

368
00:09:35,333 --> 00:09:36,133
GOING TO THE STORE, HAVING TO

369
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:37,367
BUY US A BRA AND STUFF.

370
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:38,700
>> A GIRL NEEDS HER MAMA.

371
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,133
YOU CAN'T--YOU HAVE GIRL STUFF

372
00:09:40,133 --> 00:09:41,600
THAT YOU HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF.

373
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,600
AND GROWING UP, YOU KNOW, YOU

374

FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL,

376
00:09:45,433 --> 00:09:47,067
AND YOU WANT YOUR MAMA TO BE

377
00:09:47,067 --> 00:09:48,233
THERE AND HELP YOU PICK OUT WHAT

378
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:51,200
TO WEAR AND DO YOU HAIR AND

379
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,533
ALL THAT STUFF, AND TEACH YOU

380
00:09:53,533 --> 00:09:54,500
HOW TO PUT MAKEUP ON WHEN YOU

381
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,733

SHE REGRETS IT.

386
00:10:06,033 --> 00:10:07,700
BUT I THINK IT'S US THAT--

387
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,633
THAT WE HAVE TO SUFFER FOR IT,

388
00:10:09,633 --> 00:10:11,867
NOT HER.

BUT IT JUST--I WISH, YOU KNOW,

409
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:12,067
MY FAMILY WOULD HELP A LITTLE

410
00:11:12,067 --> 00:11:13,667
MORE, AND IT KIND OF HURTS MY

411
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:15,133

>> I LIKE IT.

562
00:16:08,933 --> 00:16:10,500
ALL RIGHT, HERE'S YOUR $30.

563
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:11,433
>> OKAY.

564
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:12,300
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

565
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:15,533
[door dinging]

566
00:16:15,533 --> 00:16:16,733
I LIKE THAT CRIB, DON'T YOU?

567
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:17,867
>> YEAH.

568
00:16:17,867 --> 00:16:19,067
>> DO YOU PROMISE?

569
00:16:19,067 --> 00:16:21,067
>> YEAH.

570
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:28,100
>> DANG, THAT THING IS HEAVY.

571
00:16:37,133 --> 00:16:38,067
>> ARE THEY GONNA FIT

572
00:16:38,067 --> 00:16:38,967
THROUGH THAT?

573
00:16:38,967 --> 00:16:39,933
>> IT AIN'T GONNA FIT.

574
00:16:39,933 --> 00:16:41,733
>> DANG.

575
00:16:41,733 --> 00:16:43,500
WELL, I HOPE.

576
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,533
>> MAN.

577
00:16:44,533 --> 00:16:45,333
[laughs]

578
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,367
>> DON'T TELL ME THAT.

579
00:16:46,367 --> 00:16:47,533
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE IT

580
00:16:47,533 --> 00:16:48,867
APART.

581
00:16:48,867 --> 00:16:49,767
ALL THIS STUFF NEEDS TO COME

582
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:51,867
OUT, WHAT THEY DONATED.

583
00:16:51,867 --> 00:16:53,233
>> I'M GUESSING THAT SHE HAD

584
00:16:53,233 --> 00:16:54,300
BUGS IN HER HOUSE.

585
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,300
>> OH, MY GOD.

586
00:16:57,667 --> 00:16:58,867
>> THAT WILL CAUSE YOUR HOUSE TO

587
00:16:58,867 --> 00:17:00,100
HAVE ROACHES.

588
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,967
>> YOU DON'T WANT IT IN YOUR

589
00:17:00,967 --> 00:17:02,067
HOUSE.

590
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:03,267
IT'S SO HARD TO GET RID OF.

591
00:17:03,267 --> 00:17:04,233
>> YOU DON'T THINK THEY'RE IN

592
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:04,900
THE MATTRESS, DO YOU?

593
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,633
>> NO.

594
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:06,667
THEY'RE TOO BIG TO GO IN THE

595
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:07,400
MATTRESS.

596
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,500
BUT WE NEED TO GET IT OUT OF THE

597
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,933
HOUSE AND LET IT SIT OUTSIDE FOR

598
00:17:09,933 --> 00:17:11,067
A FEW DAYS.

599
00:17:11,067 --> 00:17:12,767
>> THERE'S ONE RIGHT THERE.

600
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:14,633
>> THEY ACCUMULATE TO TRILLIONS,

601
00:17:14,633 --> 00:17:17,067
LIKE, IN NOT EVEN A WEEK,

602
00:17:17,067 --> 00:17:18,167
AND YOU NEVER CAN GET RID OF

603
00:17:18,167 --> 00:17:18,833
'EM.

604
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,433
THEY GET INSIDE YOUR WALLS.

605
00:17:20,433 --> 00:17:21,800
>> WELL, LET'S SET IT OUTSIDE.

606
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,800
>> OH, MY GOODNESS.

607
00:17:25,767 --> 00:17:26,733
>> THEY ABOUT SUFFOCATE

608
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:27,667
IN THERE.

609
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:28,900
>> I'M SO MAD.

610
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,933
THIS CRIB'S DISGUSTING.

611
00:17:29,933 --> 00:17:31,067
>> NO, IT'S GONNA BE FINE,

612
00:17:31,067 --> 00:17:31,700
THOUGH.

613
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,367
I MEAN, ALL WE GOT TO DO IS

614
00:17:33,367 --> 00:17:35,333
SPRAY IT DOWN REAL GOOD AND THEN

615
00:17:35,333 --> 00:17:37,133
CLEAN IT AFTERWARDS AND THEN

616
00:17:37,133 --> 00:17:38,300
WE'LL BRING IT ON IN THE HOUSE.

617
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,300
>> OH.

618
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:43,833
EVEN THOUGH WE'RE GONNA MAKE

619
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,533
THE CRIB WORK, WE STILL NEED

620
00:17:45,533 --> 00:17:47,333
A LOT OF STUFF FOR PEYTON,

621
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,333
SO I'M REALLY GLAD DJ'S FAMILY

622
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:51,733
IS THROWING US A BABY SHOWER.

623
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:53,300
BECAUSE OF ALL THE DRAMA WITH MY

624
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:55,233
MOM, I ASKED HER NOT TO COME.

625
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:56,167
>> YOU MADE IT?

626
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:57,200
OH, MY GOSH.

627
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,200
I LOVE IT.

628
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:00,600
THEY'RE SO PRETTY.

629
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,967
>> "I GET MY AWESOMENESS FROM MY

630
00:18:01,967 --> 00:18:02,933
AUNT SAM."

631
00:18:02,933 --> 00:18:05,367
[laughter]

632
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:11,433
"I'M FINALLY OUT.

633
00:18:11,433 --> 00:18:12,833
I WAS RUNNING OUT OF WOMB."

634
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,067
[laughs]

635
00:18:14,067 --> 00:18:14,967
I TOLD YOU.

636
00:18:14,967 --> 00:18:15,867
LOOK, OUT HOW CUTE.

I TOLD YOU IT WAS CUTE.

638
00:18:17,667 --> 00:18:19,100
>> HEY.

640
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,067

Y'ALL'S OWN PLACE.

646
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:28,800
>> BECAUSE I WANT A PIT BULL.

647
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,667
>> WHERE ARE YOU GETTING THE PIT

648
00:18:29,667 --> 00:18:30,333
BULL FROM?

649
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:33,500

00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:37,300
>> $85.

653
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,133
>> HUH?

654
00:18:38,133 --> 00:18:39,067
>> I LIKE HOW YOU'RE PAYING FOR

655
00:18:39,067 --> 00:18:40,100
A PIT BULL INSTEAD FOR PAYING

656
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,167
FOR SOMETHING FOR PEYTON.

657
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:42,767

00:18:44,767 --> 00:18:46,067
WHY WOULD--WHY DO YOU EVEN WANT

661
00:18:46,067 --> 00:18:46,833
A PIT BULL?

662
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,067
YOU'RE ABOUT TO HAVE A SON.

663
00:18:48,067 --> 00:18:50,600
YOU'RE GONNA BE TRAINING

664
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,433
A PIT BULL ALONG WITH

665
00:18:53,433 --> 00:18:56,467
RAISING A BABY.

666
00:18:56,467 --> 00:18:58,467

667
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:07,467
>> WELL, YEAH, I GUESS WE'RE NOT

668
00:19:07,467 --> 00:19:09,733
GETTING A PIT BULL.

669
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:11,400
>> WE CAN GET IT IF YOU WANT TO

670
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,400
GET IT.

671
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:17,567
I'M GOING BACK INSIDE.

I'M ANNOYED THAT DJ IS

675
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:27,067
CONSIDERING SPENDING MONEY ON

676
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:28,900
A DOG WHEN WE HAVE MUCH MORE

677
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:29,733
IMPORTANT THINGS

678
00:19:29,733 --> 00:19:31,733
TO TAKE CARE OF.

679
00:19:43,067 --> 00:19:44,533
>> WELL, IT SAYS THAT IT CAN

680
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:46,267
PLUG IN SOMEHOW.

681
00:19:46,267 --> 00:19:47,433
>> [chuckles]

682
00:19:47,433 --> 00:19:48,433
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS.

683
00:19:48,433 --> 00:19:50,633
>> LET THE GENIUS WORK ON THAT.

684
00:19:50,633 --> 00:19:51,633
>> WHO, DJ?

685
00:19:51,633 --> 00:19:52,500
>> YEAH, OF COURSE.

686
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,700
YOU KNOW, HE'S THE GENIUS.

687
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:55,700
[laughs]

688
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:01,700
>> HE'S SO PRETTY, AIN'T HE?

689
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:05,100

693
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:12,800
>> LOOK,

694
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,800
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO THINK.

695
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,833
HE'S ANOTHER MUTT TO FEED.

696
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:17,867
THAT'S ALL I KNOW.

697
00:20:17,867 --> 00:20:19,867
>> SO YOU DON'T LIKE THE DOG?

698
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,867
>> I DON'T DISLIKE THE DOG.

699
00:20:22,867 --> 00:20:24,067
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE READY

700
00:20:24,067 --> 00:20:25,500
FOR A PUPPY.

701
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,467
>> OH, YEAH.

702
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:27,333
[laughs]

703
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,733
I'M NOT READY FOR A PUPPY,

704
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:31,000
BUT I'M READY FOR A SON.

705
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,067
>> THAT'S WHY YOU'RE NOT READY

706
00:20:32,067 --> 00:20:32,800
FOR A PUPPY.

707
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,733
>> YEAH, BECAUSE YOU'RE ABOUT TO

708
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:34,833
HAVE A SON, AND YOU'RE GONNA BE

709
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,933
COMPLETELY PREOCCUPIED WITH

710
00:20:36,933 --> 00:20:38,133
PEYTON WHEN HE'S BORN,

711
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:39,033
AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE AS

712
00:20:39,033 --> 00:20:39,967
MUCH TIME ON YOUR HANDS

713
00:20:39,967 --> 00:20:41,700
TO TRAIN A DOG.

714
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:42,767
>> DJ, ARE YOU WORRIED ABOUT HOW

715
00:20:42,767 --> 00:20:43,833
THAT DOG WILL ACT WHEN PEYTON

716
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:44,633
GETS HERE?

717
00:20:44,633 --> 00:20:46,067
>> NO, I'M NOT.

718
00:20:46,067 --> 00:20:48,000
>> YOU THINK HE'LL BE FINE?

719
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,933
>> YEAH.

720
00:20:48,933 --> 00:20:49,900
>> I DEFINITELY SEE WHERE YOUR

00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:50,967
MOM IS COMING FROM 'CAUSE THIS

722
00:20:50,967 --> 00:20:52,900
IS HER AND YOUR DADDY'S HOUSE.

723
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,867
toot!

724
00:20:53,867 --> 00:20:54,533
>> WHAT IS THAT SMELL?

725
00:20:54,533 --> 00:20:55,300
>> SO WHAT Y'ALL THINK

726
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:55,900
ABOUT THAT?

727
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,700
>> THAT'S THE DOG.

728
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,633
>> PEW.

729
00:20:58,633 --> 00:21:00,067
GET RID OF THAT THING.

730
00:21:00,067 --> 00:21:01,633
HE'S OVER HERE BETWEEN US.

731
00:21:01,633 --> 00:21:02,967
>> WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS,

732
00:21:02,967 --> 00:21:04,100
EVERY TIME I WANT SOMETHING,

733
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,067
LIKE, YOU'VE ALWAYS GOT

734
00:21:05,067 --> 00:21:05,733
SOMETHING NEGATIVE TO SAY

735
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:06,400
ABOUT IT.

736
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,267
>> YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A REALLY

737
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:08,467
HUGE PRIORITY IN YOUR LIFE IN

738
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:09,200
THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS.

739
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,200
>> I'M JUST SAYING YOU ALL AIN'T

740
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,967
GOT TO WORRY ABOUT ME.

741
00:21:10,967 --> 00:21:11,667
YOU CAN TRUST ME.

742
00:21:11,667 --> 00:21:13,567
AND I'VE GOT THIS.

743
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:15,167
I GOT EVERYTHING UNDER CONTROL.

744
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:16,100
DON'T ASK ME NO MORE QUESTIONS,

745
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:18,100
I SWEAR TO GOD.

746
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,100
OR WHATEVER Y'ALL SAY, I MEAN,

747
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:21,900

00:36:12,467 --> 00:36:14,467
* OH-OH-OH

1119
00:36:19,467 --> 00:36:20,633
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1120
00:36:20,633 --> 00:36:22,667
I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY

1121
00:36:22,667 --> 00:36:23,467
SHE DID THAT.

1122
00:36:23,467 --> 00:36:24,967
BUT THEN AGAIN, DRUGS MAKE YOU

1123
00:36:24,967 --> 00:36:26,967
DO CRAZY STUFF.

1124
00:36:30,967 --> 00:36:34,700
MY MAMA'S A MESS.

1125
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:36,300
>> SHE IS.

1126
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,600
TO BE HONEST, I DON'T WORRY

1127
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,600
WITH HER NO MORE.

1128
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:44,133
>> IF Y'ALL EVER NEED ANYTHING,

1129
00:36:44,133 --> 00:36:46,133
ALL YOU GOT TO DO IS CALL ME.

1130
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,067
SHE CAN COME LIVE WITH ME.

1131
00:36:50,067 --> 00:36:51,067
DJ JUST DON'T KNOW IT YET, BUT

1132
00:36:51,067 --> 00:36:51,833
SHE CAN COME LIVE WITH ME

1133
00:36:51,833 --> 00:36:52,833
WHENEVER I GET MY OWN HOUSE.

1134
00:36:52,833 --> 00:36:54,267
>> I'M COMING, DEFINITELY.

1135
00:36:54,267 --> 00:36:55,567
>> DEFINITELY.

1136
00:36:55,567 --> 00:36:57,567
>> DEFINITELY.

1137
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,267
>> MY MOM HAS BEEN RELEASED

1138
00:37:05,267 --> 00:37:06,900
UNTIL HER TRIAL.

1139
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:07,767
AND EVEN THOUGH I'M REALLY

1140
00:37:07,767 --> 00:37:09,567
HURT, WE'RE GOING OVER TO SPEND

1141
00:37:09,567 --> 00:37:11,300
SOME TIME WITH HER.

1142
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,400
IF MAMA GOES TO JAIL, I DON'T

1143
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,367
THINK THAT WOULD REALLY AFFECT

1144
00:37:13,367 --> 00:37:14,800
PEYTON MUCH 'CAUSE HE'LL STILL

1145
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:15,533
BE YOUNG.

1146
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:17,067
AND PEYTON WON'T ASK QUESTIONS,

1147
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:17,800
YOU KNOW, LIKE,

1148
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,067
"WHY IS SHE IN JAIL?"

1149
00:37:20,067 --> 00:37:22,267
AND "WHEN IS SHE COMING HOME?"

1150
00:37:22,267 --> 00:37:23,333
AND "WHAT IS JAIL?"

1151
00:37:23,333 --> 00:37:25,333
AND ALL THAT STUFF.

1152
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,100
HEY THERE.

1153
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,100
>> COME IN.

1154
00:37:39,233 --> 00:37:40,467
IF I DO GET SENT OFF,

1155
00:37:40,467 --> 00:37:42,300
YOU GONNA WRITE ME?

1156
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,167
>> I WILL DECIDE TO COME SEE

1157
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:44,400
YOU, BUT I WON'T BE ABLE TO

1158
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:45,467
MAKE MANY TRIPS.

1159
00:37:45,467 --> 00:37:46,167
>> MM-MM.

1160
00:37:46,167 --> 00:37:48,567
>> THAT'S SUCH A LONG DRIVE.

1161
00:37:48,567 --> 00:37:51,300
DON'T CRY.

1162
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:53,067
EVERYBODY MAKES MISTAKES, MAMA.

1163
00:37:53,067 --> 00:37:57,267
>> I KNOW IT.

1164
00:37:57,267 --> 00:37:59,733
>> I'M NOT SAYING THIS IS GONNA

1165
00:37:59,733 --> 00:38:00,733
HAPPEN, BUT I'M SAYING, YOU

1166
00:38:00,733 --> 00:38:02,067
KNOW, IF IT WAS TO HAPPEN, AS

1167
00:38:02,067 --> 00:38:03,400
LONG AS YOU DO GOOD, LIKE,

1168
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,733
YOU'LL GET OUT IN HALF THE TIME.

1169
00:38:05,733 --> 00:38:06,900
>> [sighs]

1170
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:07,600
I DON'T WANT TO DO

1171
00:38:07,600 --> 00:38:08,267
NONE OF IT, DJ.

1172
00:38:08,267 --> 00:38:09,067
I'M SCARED.

1173
00:38:09,067 --> 00:38:09,900
>> I KNOW.

1174
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:10,833
>> BUT, YOU KNOW, I DIDN'T THINK

1175
00:38:10,833 --> 00:38:12,267
ABOUT WELL, EVENTUALLY, THIS IS

1176
00:38:12,267 --> 00:38:13,167
GONNA CATCH UP WITH ME OR I'M

1177
00:38:13,167 --> 00:38:15,133
GONNA HAVE TO--IT DIDN'T EVEN

1178
00:38:15,133 --> 00:38:16,533
CROSS MY MIND.

1179
00:38:16,533 --> 00:38:17,800
I WISH I COULD TAKE IT ALL BACK,

1180
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,100
ERASE IT.

1181
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:21,767
I MIGHT BE GONE AWAY FROM HIM.

1182
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:23,567
MY GOD, IT JUST ABOUT DRIVES ME

1183
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,567
CRAZY.

1184
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,467
[Peyton crying]

1185
00:38:28,467 --> 00:38:30,467
>> [sniffling]

1186
00:38:32,333 --> 00:38:36,100
>> MAMA, DON'T MAKE ME CRY.

1187
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,767
DON'T CRY.

1188
00:38:37,767 --> 00:38:39,067
I'VE GOT FAITH.

1189
00:38:39,067 --> 00:38:40,067
I'VE GOT FAITH THAT EVERYTHING'S

1190
00:38:40,067 --> 00:38:41,967
GONNA WORK OUT.

1191
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:49,767
I'M JUST GONNA MISS YOU.

1192
00:38:49,767 --> 00:38:51,433
>> I'LL MISS YOU, BABY.

1193
00:38:51,433 --> 00:38:53,433
>> [sniffling]

1194
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:56,733
>> I LOVE YOU.

1195
00:38:56,733 --> 00:38:58,733
>> I LOVE YOU.

1196
00:39:08,733 --> 00:39:10,933
WHEN I WAS IN FOURTH GRADE IS

1197
00:39:10,933 --> 00:39:12,067
WHEN MY MAMA STARTED MESSING UP

1198
00:39:12,067 --> 00:39:13,833
REAL BAD WITH HER PILLS,

1199
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:15,400
AND IT AFFECTED MY WHOLE

1200
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:16,567
CHILDHOOD.

1201
00:39:16,567 --> 00:39:17,467
I WAS JUST EMBARRASSED TO EVEN

1202
00:39:17,467 --> 00:39:18,400
GO PLACES WITH HER.

1203
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,767
IT REALLY HURT MY FEELINGS AND

1204
00:39:19,767 --> 00:39:21,467
HOW SHE LEFT 'CAUSE I'M JUST

1205
00:39:21,467 --> 00:39:23,100
LIKE--'CAUSE I LOVE PEYTON SO

1206
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,100
MUCH, I'M JUST--

1207
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,833
HOW DO YOU GET--HOW CAN YOU LOVE

1208
00:39:25,833 --> 00:39:27,200
YOUR CHILD SO MUCH AND JUST

1209
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,733
LEAVE 'EM LIKE SHE DID ME?

1210
00:39:29,733 --> 00:39:32,767
[Peyton crying]

1211
00:39:36,433 --> 00:39:38,300
IT'S JUST SO HARD TO BE IN

1212
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,633
HIGH SCHOOL AND HAVE A BABY

1213
00:39:39,633 --> 00:39:41,267
AND TRY TO FINISH SCHOOL AND,

1214
00:39:41,267 --> 00:39:42,300
YOU KNOW, STILL HAVE YOUR

1215
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,967
TEENAGE LIFE, 'CAUSE ONCE YOU

1216
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:45,100
HAVE A BABY, YOU'RE NOT--

1217
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:45,933
YOU'RE AN ADULT.

1218
00:39:45,933 --> 00:39:47,100
YOU'RE NOT A TEENAGER ANYMORE.

1219
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,333
YOU CAN'T DO THE THINGS YOU

1220
00:39:48,333 --> 00:39:49,167
WANTED TO DO.

1221
00:39:49,167 --> 00:39:50,367
YOUR WHOLE LIFE REVOLVES AROUND

1222
00:39:50,367 --> 00:39:52,367
YOUR BABY.

1223
00:39:53,300 --> 00:39:54,333
EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T FINISH

1224
00:39:54,333 --> 00:39:55,467
SCHOOL AND I'M NOT GONNA

1225
00:39:55,467 --> 00:39:56,733
GRADUATE, I DO HOPE THAT I DO

1226
00:39:56,733 --> 00:39:58,467
GET SOME KIND OF EDUCATION,

1227
00:39:58,467 --> 00:39:59,700
WHICH I PLAN TO DO.

1228
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:00,667
I WANT TO GO TO COLLEGE, AND I

1229
00:40:00,667 --> 00:40:01,867
WANT TO BE INDEPENDENT AND MAKE

1230
00:40:01,867 --> 00:40:03,133
SOMETHING OF MYSELF.

1231
00:40:03,133 --> 00:40:05,167
LOOK AT HIS LITTLE SOCK.

1232
00:40:05,167 --> 00:40:06,100
>> IT FELL OFF.

1233
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:07,433
>> [speaking indistinctly]

1234
00:40:07,433 --> 00:40:08,633
HOPEFULLY SOON, DJ AND I WILL

1235
00:40:08,633 --> 00:40:10,400
GET OUR OWN HOUSE, AND WE CAN BE

1236
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:11,700
A FAMILY AND RAISE PEYTON IN OUR

1237
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:13,600
OWN HOME.

1238
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:14,767
I JUST FEEL LIKE PEYTON WILL

1239
00:40:14,767 --> 00:40:16,567
GROW UP BEING VERY LOVED AND

1240
00:40:16,567 --> 00:40:17,967
WITH BOTH OF HIS PARENTS.

1241
00:40:17,967 --> 00:40:19,200
AND I JUST WANT PEYTON TO HAVE

1242
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:20,367
A BETTER CHILDHOOD THAN THE ONE

1243
00:40:20,367 --> 00:40:22,367
I DID.

1244
00:40:41,333 --> 00:40:42,733
>> YOU DISRESPECTED THE PERSON

1245
00:40:42,733 --> 00:40:44,300
WHO TAKES OF YOUR CHILDREN.

1246
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,100
IT'S NOT FAIR TO ME, TONY.

1247
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:47,100
>> I'M [bleep] LEAVING.

1248
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:50,100
I GO TO WORK EVERY [bleep] DAY!

1249
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:50,833
>> I DO TOO!

1250
00:40:50,833 --> 00:40:51,500
>> [bleep]!

1251
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:52,167
>> GET OUT!

1252
00:40:52,167 --> 00:40:52,967
YOU ARE NOT GONNA TALK TO HER

1253
00:40:52,967 --> 00:40:53,667
LIKE THAT!

1254
00:40:53,667 --> 00:40:54,867
>> [bleep] YOU!

1255
00:40:54,867 --> 00:40:55,867
>> I HATE THIS, KARLEY!

1256
00:40:55,867 --> 00:40:56,533
I HATE THIS!

1257
00:40:56,533 --> 00:40:58,533
[screams]
