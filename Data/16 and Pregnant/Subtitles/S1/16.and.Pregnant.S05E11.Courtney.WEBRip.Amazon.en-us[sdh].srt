1
00:00:04,033 --> 00:00:06,567
>> THREE, TWO, ONE, GO!

2
00:00:06,567 --> 00:00:08,267
>> AH!

3
00:00:08,267 --> 00:00:10,167
>> I'M COURTNEY.

4
00:00:10,167 --> 00:00:11,167
I LIVE IN WOODLAND PARK,

5
00:00:11,167 --> 00:00:12,300
COLORADO, AND I'M A SENIOR IN

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,400
HIGH SCHOOL.

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,067
OH, I GOT IT!

8
00:00:14,067 --> 00:00:14,733
>> DID YOU?

9
00:00:14,733 --> 00:00:15,400
>> OH.

10
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,667
I'M PRETTY SURE I WON IT.

11
00:00:16,667 --> 00:00:18,000
MY PARENTS ARE DIVORCED,

12
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,267
BUT THEY STAYED GOOD FRIENDS.

13
00:00:19,267 --> 00:00:20,900
AND EVEN THOUGH I'M REALLY CLOSE

14
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:22,500
WITH MY MOM, I LIVE WITH MY DAD.

15
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,233
>> OH, I LOVE YOU.

16
00:00:23,233 --> 00:00:24,033
>> LOVE YOU.

17
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:25,067
I WAS BORN WITH A CLEFT LIP

18
00:00:25,067 --> 00:00:27,033
AND A CLEFT PALATE, MEANING

19
00:00:27,033 --> 00:00:28,600
I HAD A GAP ON BOTH SIDES OF MY

20
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,267
LIP AND A GAP BETWEEN MY NOSE

21
00:00:30,267 --> 00:00:31,467
AND THE ROOF OF MY MOUTH.

22
00:00:31,467 --> 00:00:34,000
>> OH, YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

23
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,700
>> SO I'VE HAD A TOTAL OF SEVEN

24
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,067
RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERIES

25
00:00:37,067 --> 00:00:38,600
SINCE I WAS A BABY.

26
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,900
AND I WAS ALWAYS WORRIED ABOUT

27
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:41,700
WHAT PEOPLE THOUGHT OF MY CLEFT,

28
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:42,733
BUT WHEN I MET MY BOYFRIEND,

29
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:44,067
SCOTT, HE COULDN'T EVEN TELL,

30
00:00:44,067 --> 00:00:45,567
AND WE FELL IN LOVE.

31
00:00:45,567 --> 00:00:46,400
>> LOVE YOU.

32
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,567
>> AND EVEN THOUGH I'M REALLY

33
00:00:47,567 --> 00:00:48,800
RELIGIOUS AND ALWAYS KIND OF

34
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,500
BEEN SAVING MYSELF FOR MARRIAGE,

35
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,800
THAT DIDN'T GO SO WELL,

36
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,500
AND NOW I'M PREGNANT.

37
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,200
WHEN I GOT PREGNANT, MY PARENTS

38
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,600
WERE REALLY DISAPPOINTED,

39
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,767
SO I STARTED GOING BACK TO

40
00:01:05,767 --> 00:01:07,500
CHURCH AND DECIDED THAT I WANTED

41
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,600
TO BE ABSTINENT.

42
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,867
SCOTT WASN'T THRILLED,

43
00:01:09,867 --> 00:01:11,367
BUT HE STUCK BY MY SIDE.

44
00:01:11,367 --> 00:01:13,567
I DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE SEX UNTIL

45
00:01:13,567 --> 00:01:15,233
I WAS MARRIED, AND--

46
00:01:15,233 --> 00:01:16,333
>> YOU MAKE IT SEEM LIKE IT WAS

47
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:17,400
ALL MY FAULT.

48
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,433
>> NO, I GAVE IN.

49
00:01:18,433 --> 00:01:19,567
IT WAS MY FAULT TOO.

50
00:01:19,567 --> 00:01:21,100
>> YOU GAVE IN A LOT WITHOUT ME

51
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,533
EVEN TRYING.

52
00:01:22,533 --> 00:01:23,900
>> I JUST GAVE IN TO YOUR LONG

53
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:24,700
HAIR.

54
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,067
YOUR LONG, LUSCIOUS HAIR.

55
00:01:26,067 --> 00:01:27,067
>> OH, GOD.

56
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:28,600
>> WHAT DID YOU THINK OF ME

57
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:31,500
RIGHT WHEN YOU MET ME?

58
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,600
>> I DON'T REMEMBER.

59
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,333
>> YES, YOU DO.

60
00:01:34,333 --> 00:01:35,600
[laughs]

61
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,500
"SHE'S GOT SOME BIG OLE

62
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,900
BOOBIES."

63
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,633
>> AND YOU LOOKED BEAUTIFUL.

64
00:01:40,633 --> 00:01:41,367
>> UH-HUH.

65
00:01:41,367 --> 00:01:42,267
>> THAT WASN'T THE ONLY THING.

66
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:44,400
>> YEAH, YOU NOTICED THAT LAST.

67
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,800
>> NO, I NOTICED THAT FIRST.

68
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,200
LOOKED AT THE FACE THEN DOWN.

69
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,067
>> SCOTT WORKS FULL-TIME AS AN

70
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:52,367
ELECTRICIAN'S APPRENTICE

71
00:01:52,367 --> 00:01:53,767
AND MAKES ENOUGH MONEY TO RENT

72
00:01:53,767 --> 00:01:55,767
HIS OWN TWO-BEDROOM APARTMENT,

73
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:56,967
AND HE WANTS ME TO MOVE IN WITH

74
00:01:56,967 --> 00:01:58,833
HIM BEFORE THE BABY IS BORN.

75
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:00,567
>> CAN WE GET TWO WHEAT GRASS

76
00:02:00,567 --> 00:02:03,833
SHOTS AND THE 12-OUNCE

77
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:04,500
MELLOW MANGO?

78
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:06,500
>> OKAY.

79
00:02:07,867 --> 00:02:08,667
>> UGH.

80
00:02:08,667 --> 00:02:09,333
READY?

81
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,067
>> ALL RIGHT, READY?

82
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:12,067
THREE, TWO, ONE.

83
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:15,767
>> WE'RE GONNA HAVE

84
00:02:15,767 --> 00:02:17,133
A SUPER BABY.

85
00:02:17,133 --> 00:02:18,067
[giggles]

86
00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:19,467
I'M WORRIED THAT IF I MOVE IN

87
00:02:19,467 --> 00:02:20,433
WITH YOU, WE'LL BE TEMPTED

88
00:02:20,433 --> 00:02:21,433
TO HAVE SEX.

89
00:02:21,433 --> 00:02:22,733
IS IT HARD FOR YOU?

90
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:24,400
>> YEAH.

91
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,300
OF COURSE IT'S GONNA BE

92
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:25,967
A CHALLENGE.

93
00:02:25,967 --> 00:02:27,800
>> YOU'RE A 19-YEAR-OLD,

94
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,300
FULL OF HORMONE,

95
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,500
WANT TO GET THE HANKY-PANKY.

96
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:34,067
>> 90% OF GUYS, I WOULD SAY, DO.

97
00:02:34,067 --> 00:02:35,600
>> I WANT TO BE WITH THAT 10%

98
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,333
OF GUYS.

99
00:02:36,333 --> 00:02:38,567
>> MORE LIKE 99.9% OF GUYS.

100
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:39,233
>> WELL, THEN, I HOPE

101
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:40,567
YOU'RE THE 1% OF GUYS.

102
00:02:40,567 --> 00:02:42,400
>> 99.999% OF GUYS.

103
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,633
>> THAT'S BECAUSE THEY DON'T

104
00:02:43,633 --> 00:02:45,267
LOOK AT IT LIKE I LOOK AT IT,

105
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:46,300
AND I WANT YOU TO GET ON THE

106
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,700
SAME LEVEL AS ME.

107
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,067
>> I JUST SEE IT AS,

108
00:02:49,067 --> 00:02:50,800
WE'RE PREGNANT, YOU KNOW?

109
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,833
WHAT HARM'S GONNA COME OUT

110
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:52,500
OF IT?

111
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:54,067
>> THE RELIGIOUS PART OF IT IS,

112
00:02:54,067 --> 00:02:55,700
WE SHOULD WAIT FOR SOMEBODY TO

113
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:58,267
KNOW THAT WE LOVE EACH OTHER

114
00:02:58,267 --> 00:03:00,300
AND TO KNOW THAT IT'S NOT LUST.

115
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,667
ALSO, IF I DO MOVE IN,

116
00:03:01,667 --> 00:03:04,900
I WANT TO GET--START READING

117
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:06,700
THE BIBLE MORE AND GETTING MORE

118
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:08,833
DEDICATED TO THAT.

119
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:13,667
>> I JUST WANT US TO GET ON THE

120
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:17,400
SAME MORALS.

121
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,067
>> I DON'T KNOW.

122
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:19,200
I THINK WE'RE PRETTY GOOD

123
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,333
COMPARED TO MOST.

124
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:21,933
>> THE WAY I LOOK AT IT IS,

125
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:24,400
IF YOU WAIT FOR ME, THEN I'LL

126
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,467
KNOW FOR SURE THAT YOU WANT TO

127
00:03:25,467 --> 00:03:26,867
BE WITH ME, 'CAUSE YOU'LL DO

128
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:28,367
ANYTHING TO BE WITH ME.

129
00:03:28,367 --> 00:03:29,333
>> YEAH.

130
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,667
[laughs]

131
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:32,833
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

132
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,900
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

133
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,367
>> JUST SAY...

134
00:03:36,367 --> 00:03:40,100
>> YES, COURTNEY, YOU ARE RIGHT.

135
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,267
>> I KNOW I EXPECT A LOT FROM

136
00:03:41,267 --> 00:03:43,100
SCOTT, BUT MY RELIGION IS A HUGE

137
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:44,467
PART OF MY LIFE.

138
00:03:44,467 --> 00:03:45,967
MY FRIENDS WERE SHOCKED WHEN

139
00:03:45,967 --> 00:03:47,233
I STRAYED FROM IT AND GOT

140
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:47,900
PREGNANT.

141
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,100
AND NOW THAT I'M FINISHING

142
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,067
SCHOOL ONLINE, IT'S HARDER AND

143
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:54,100
HARDER TO SEE THEM.

144
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,867
>> I'M KIND OF SAD THAT YOU

145
00:03:55,867 --> 00:03:57,067
CANNOT GO ROLLER SKATING WITH ME

146
00:03:57,067 --> 00:03:58,100
RIGHT NOW, BECAUSE I'VE BEEN

147
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,167
WANTING TO ASK YOU TO GO ROLLER

148
00:03:59,167 --> 00:04:01,267
SKATING, AND EVERY SINGLE TIME

149
00:04:01,267 --> 00:04:02,633
I'M LIKE, "WAIT, NO, I CAN'T.

150
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:03,433
SHE'S PREGNANT."

151
00:04:03,433 --> 00:04:04,533
THAT'S NOT COOL.

152
00:04:04,533 --> 00:04:05,933
>> I'M SAD I WON'T BE ABLE TO

153
00:04:05,933 --> 00:04:07,800
WALK WITH MY CLASS.

154
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,933
IT'S LIKE, WHEN YOU THINK OF

155
00:04:08,933 --> 00:04:10,067
HIGH SCHOOL, YOU THINK OF

156
00:04:10,067 --> 00:04:11,633
SENIOR--YOUR SENIOR YEAR,

157
00:04:11,633 --> 00:04:12,500
WALKING WITH YOUR CLASS,

158
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,400
THROWING YOUR HAT UP IN THE AIR.

159
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,333
>> DOES YOUR ONLINE SCHOOL NOT

160
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,600
DO A WALKING, LIKE, GRADUATION?

161
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,367
>> NO.

162
00:04:18,367 --> 00:04:19,133
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA HAVE

163
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:20,067
A GRADUATION PARTY.

164
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:21,500
I MET SCOTT AT HIS GRADUATION

165
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,400
PARTY.

166
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,700
RIGHT WHEN I SAW HIM, HE WAS,

167
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,833
LIKE, TOWERING OVER ME,

168
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,100
AND I WAS LIKE, "HE'S SO TALL.

169
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,633
HE HAS NICE HAIR."

170
00:04:28,633 --> 00:04:30,300
>> AND HE HAS NICE HAIR.

171
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,167
>> SO I WAS LIKE, "OKAY,

172
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:34,500
I COULD WORK WITH THIS."

173
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,600
>> HERE'S YOUR GIFTS FOR ALL

174
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,267
YOUR STUFF.

175
00:04:36,267 --> 00:04:36,933
>> YUM!

176
00:04:36,933 --> 00:04:37,667
>> Y'ALL LET ME KNOW

177
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:38,333
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.

178
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:38,967
>> OKAY, THANK YOU.

179
00:04:38,967 --> 00:04:39,600
>> THANK YOU.

180
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,733
I REMEMBER YOU ALWAYS BEING THE

181
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:43,233
ONE WHO WAS ABSTINENT.

182
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:44,500
DID YOU GUYS--WAS THAT THE FIRST

183
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:45,433
TIME YOU GUYS HAD HAD SEX?

184
00:04:45,433 --> 00:04:47,433
>> NO, WE DIDN'T HAVE SEX FOR

185
00:04:47,433 --> 00:04:49,300
THE FIRST FEW MONTHS, AND THEN

186
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,333
AFTER A WHILE, I KIND OF

187
00:04:50,333 --> 00:04:53,433
GAVE IN, AND THEN WE WERE DOING

188
00:04:53,433 --> 00:04:55,767
IT FOR A WHILE AFTERWARDS,

189
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:57,167
AND THEN I GOT PREGNANT.

190
00:04:57,167 --> 00:04:58,700
AND THEN I JUST KIND OF GATHERED

191
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,600
MYSELF BACK UP, GOT MY MORALS

192
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,133
BACK, AND WAS LIKE, "OKAY,"

193
00:05:02,133 --> 00:05:02,900
SO WE STOPPED.

194
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,700
>> I THINK THAT WOULD BE HARD

195
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,567
FOR MOST PEOPLE TO GO FROM

196
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:05,667
HAVING SEX TO JUST, LIKE,

197
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:06,433
OH, CUT OFF.

198
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:07,333
>> OH, YEAH.

199
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:08,567
SCOTT WANTS ME TO MOVE IN WITH

200
00:05:08,567 --> 00:05:10,133
HIM, BUT I DON'T WANT TO TEMPT

201
00:05:10,133 --> 00:05:13,400
HIM AND MYSELF TO HAVE SEX.

202
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,933
I THINK THAT WOULD JUST MAKE IT

203
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:15,967
A LOT HARDER.

204
00:05:15,967 --> 00:05:17,067
I THINK IT WOULD BE GOOD IF YOU

205
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:18,200
GUYS WERE BOTH THERE FOR THE

206
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,300
BEGINNING PARTS.

207
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,067
YOUR DAD AND YOUR SISTER

208
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:20,867
PROBABLY AREN'T GONNA HELP YOU

209
00:05:20,867 --> 00:05:21,600
TAKE SHIFTS WITH THE BABY.

210
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,267
>> NO.

211
00:05:22,267 --> 00:05:24,233
>> SO I THINK PROBABLY FOR YOUR

212
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:25,967
MENTAL HEALTH YOU SHOULD

213
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:27,133
PROBABLY JUST MOVE IN WITH

214
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:27,767
SCOTT.

215
00:05:27,767 --> 00:05:29,133
>> MOVING IN WITH SCOTT WOULD

216
00:05:29,133 --> 00:05:31,133
PROBABLY MAKE THINGS EASIER

217
00:05:31,133 --> 00:05:33,200
BECAUSE HE LIVES 45 MINUTES

218
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,100
AWAY, AND SOME WEEKS I ONLY SEE

219
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,467
HIM WHEN HE COMES OVER FOR

220
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:37,267
SUNDAY DINNER.

221
00:05:37,267 --> 00:05:38,333
>> CAN WE GET SCOTT TO PRAY,

222
00:05:38,333 --> 00:05:39,133
YOU THINK?

223
00:05:39,133 --> 00:05:39,867
>> NO. [laughs]

224
00:05:39,867 --> 00:05:40,667
>> NO?

225
00:05:40,667 --> 00:05:42,533
>> DAD, HE'S SHY.

226
00:05:42,533 --> 00:05:43,867
>> THANK YOU, FATHER, FOR THIS

227
00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:45,067
FOOD, AND THANK YOU FOR THIS

228
00:05:45,067 --> 00:05:46,633
BEAUTIFUL DAY, AND GIVE US

229
00:05:46,633 --> 00:05:47,900
WISDOM AS WE SPEAK.

230
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:48,900
>> AMEN.

231
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,067
>> YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE BOUGHT

232
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:51,567
YOUR PURITY RING?

233
00:05:51,567 --> 00:05:52,233
>> YEAH.

234
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:53,833
>> AND WE TALKED PRETTY

235
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,300
EXTENSIVELY ABOUT THAT, AND YOU

236
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,133
HAD MADE A COMMITMENT.

237
00:05:57,133 --> 00:05:59,333
>> MADE A PROMISE TO GOD.

238
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,100
>> THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT OF

239
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,267
A SHOCKER, YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE

240
00:06:01,267 --> 00:06:02,233
WE'D TALKED ABOUT THAT,

241
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:02,900
YOU KNOW?

242
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:03,833
ARE YOU ACTIVE?

243
00:06:03,833 --> 00:06:04,733
>> WELL, AT THE SAME TIME,

244
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:06,367
THIS MADE ME CLOSER TO GOD.

245
00:06:06,367 --> 00:06:07,467
>> YEAH? HOW SO?

246
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:08,600
>> I STARTED READING THE BIBLE,

247
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,600
AND I STARTED PRAYING MORE,

248
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:10,400
AND I DON'T KNOW.

249
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:11,633
IT JUST CHANGED ME.

250
00:06:11,633 --> 00:06:14,700
>> SO YOU WERE NOT PRACTICING

251
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,067
ABSTINENCE, GOT PREGNANT.

252
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:18,567
WHERE ARE YOU AT NOW WITH

253
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:20,233
BEING PURE?

254
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:22,900
>> WE'RE REMAINING ABSTINENT.

255
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,200
>> UNTIL...

256
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,367
>> WE GET MARRIED.

257
00:06:26,367 --> 00:06:27,833
WHICH, HE WANTS TO GET MARRIED

258
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:30,533
TOMORROW.

259
00:06:30,533 --> 00:06:31,567
>> [laughs]

260
00:06:31,567 --> 00:06:32,667
>> WELL, HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

261
00:06:32,667 --> 00:06:33,333
YOU KNOW WHAT, THOUGH?

262
00:06:33,333 --> 00:06:34,067
HERE'S THE THING:

263
00:06:34,067 --> 00:06:34,733
THAT'S NORMAL.

264
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:37,400
>> IT'S HARD TO GO FROM BEING

265
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,967
INTIMATE TO ALL OF A SUDDEN

266
00:06:38,967 --> 00:06:39,767
JUST NOT.

267
00:06:39,767 --> 00:06:41,400
I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD DO IT.

268
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,100
>> I THINK IT TAKES A LOT OF

269
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,533
DEDICATION TO GOD.

270
00:06:44,533 --> 00:06:45,967
AND YEAH, IT'S HARD,

271
00:06:45,967 --> 00:06:47,200
BUT I JUST PRAY,

272
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:48,333
AND IT HELPS ME THROUGH IT.

273
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:51,367
>> SCOTT, WHAT DO YOU FEEL?

274
00:06:51,367 --> 00:06:52,500
>> I DON'T KNOW.

275
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,733
I STILL FEEL THE SAME ABOUT HER.

276
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:54,833
IT'S HELPING HER.

277
00:06:54,833 --> 00:06:56,067
>> WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW IT'S

278
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:56,733
HELPED YOU.

279
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:58,233
>> ME?

280
00:06:58,233 --> 00:06:59,900
>> OUR RELATIONSHIP.

281
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,267
>> TO HELP IT GROW STRONGER?

282
00:07:01,267 --> 00:07:02,067
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

283
00:07:02,067 --> 00:07:03,967
>> YEAH, TO BE ON THE SAME

284
00:07:03,967 --> 00:07:07,467
MORAL LEVEL.

285
00:07:07,467 --> 00:07:08,367
>> YEAH.

286
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:10,933
>> SO THAT'S TOUGH, ISN'T IT?

287
00:07:10,933 --> 00:07:12,567
IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S REALLY TOUGH

288
00:07:12,567 --> 00:07:13,233
ON SCOTT.

289
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:13,967
>> MM-HMM.

290
00:07:13,967 --> 00:07:14,800
>> WELL, I DON'T BLAME HIM.

291
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:15,533
>> I DON'T BLAME HIM.

292
00:07:15,533 --> 00:07:17,200
IS IT TOUGH?

293
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:17,867
IS IT TOUGH?

294
00:07:17,867 --> 00:07:18,533
>> OH, YEAH.

295
00:07:18,533 --> 00:07:19,933
>> SURE.

296
00:07:19,933 --> 00:07:21,433
SO WHAT DO YOU DO, SCOTT?

297
00:07:21,433 --> 00:07:23,433
HOW DO YOU... [laughs]

298
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,767
>> I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT

299
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:27,767
THIS.

300
00:07:27,767 --> 00:07:28,867
CAN WE NOT?

301
00:07:28,867 --> 00:07:30,300
I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS.

302
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:30,967
I DON'T KNOW.

303
00:07:30,967 --> 00:07:32,067
IT'S JUST AWKWARD FOR ME BECAUSE

304
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:32,800
I DON'T LIKE TALKING ABOUT

305
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,633
THAT STUFF.

306
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:34,733
>> IT'S DIFFERENT FOR YOU.

307
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:35,400
YOU GOT TO UNDERSTAND.

308
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,267
>> I DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT

309
00:07:36,267 --> 00:07:36,933
IT, 'KAY?

310
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:37,633
>> I'M JUST SAYING.

311
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:38,367
>> I'M JUST SERIOUS.

312
00:07:38,367 --> 00:07:44,633
>> * IT'S FINE *

313
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,233
>> WHAT AM I GONNA DO IF I GO

314
00:07:58,233 --> 00:08:00,067
INTO LABOR BY MYSELF?

315
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:01,800
WHAT IF I'M IN SO MUCH PAIN

316
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,200
THAT I CAN'T DRIVE?

317
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,467
WE'RE TOO BROKE TO CALL AN

318
00:08:04,467 --> 00:08:05,200
AMBULANCE.

319
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:06,133
>> THAT'S WHY YOU NEED TO MOVE

320
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:07,333
IN.

321
00:08:07,333 --> 00:08:08,333
>> YEAH, BUT WHAT IF YOU'RE GONE

322
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,367
WHEN I MOVE IN?

323
00:08:09,367 --> 00:08:11,567
>> I'M ONLY 10, 15 MINUTES AWAY.

324
00:08:11,567 --> 00:08:12,367
>> I DON'T KNOW.

325
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:13,633
I'M TRYING TO THINK THINGS

326
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:14,667
THROUGH.

327
00:08:14,667 --> 00:08:16,500
I KNOW SCOTT IS EAGER FOR ME TO

328
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,400
MAKE A DECISION, BUT I WANT TO

329
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,700
DO WHAT'S BEST FOR MYSELF

330
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,700
AND THE BABY.

331
00:08:23,567 --> 00:08:24,767
>> WHAT HAVE YOU BEEN UP TO?

332
00:08:24,767 --> 00:08:26,067
>> ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

333
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:27,200
>> ABSOLUTELY NOTHING?

334
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:28,500
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

335
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:29,533
>> YEAH.

336
00:08:29,533 --> 00:08:31,533
>> YOU'RE ALWAYS HUNGRY.

337
00:08:33,867 --> 00:08:34,767
>> THANK YOU.

338
00:08:34,767 --> 00:08:35,933
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

339
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:37,467
>> THANK YOU KINDLY.

340
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:39,267
>> SO IS COURT STILL LIVING

341
00:08:39,267 --> 00:08:39,933
AT HOME?

342
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:40,867
HOW'S YOUR GUYS' RELATIONSHIP

343
00:08:40,867 --> 00:08:41,533
DOING?

344
00:08:41,533 --> 00:08:42,867
>> I WANTED HER TO MOVE IN,

345
00:08:42,867 --> 00:08:45,167
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF SHE DOES.

346
00:08:45,167 --> 00:08:46,333
I'M HOPING SHE DOES, JUST

347
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,500
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE

348
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,733
A WEEKEND DAD.

349
00:08:48,733 --> 00:08:50,067
>> AND HAS SHE GIVEN YOU ANY OF

350
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:51,833
HER, LIKE, POINT OF VIEW ON THIS

351
00:08:51,833 --> 00:08:53,367
WHOLE MOVING IN THING?

352
00:08:53,367 --> 00:08:54,600
>> YEAH, BASICALLY,

353
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,933
WE'RE NOT MARRIED.

354
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:57,733
DON'T WANT TO BE TEMPTED TO HAVE

355
00:08:57,733 --> 00:08:58,833
SEX AGAIN.

356
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:00,100
>> YOU'VE DECIDED YOU'RE NOT,

357
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:01,533
LIKE, HAVING SEX ANYMORE?

358
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:03,067
>> YEAH, HER WHOLE PHILO--IS,

359
00:09:03,067 --> 00:09:04,533
"IF YOU CAN'T WAIT, THEN YOU

360
00:09:04,533 --> 00:09:05,833
OBVIOUSLY DON'T LOVE ME."

361
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,633
>> WELL, YEAH, BUT EVERYBODY

362
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:09,267
HAS NEEDS...

363
00:09:09,267 --> 00:09:09,933
>> YEAH.

364
00:09:09,933 --> 00:09:10,600
>> WHEN YOU'RE IN

365
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:11,267
A RELATIONSHIP.

366
00:09:11,267 --> 00:09:12,200
>> BELIEVE ME, I'M NOT TOO

367
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,200
EXCITED ABOUT IT.

368
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,533
IT'S NOT EASY AT ALL.

369
00:09:14,533 --> 00:09:15,800
IT'S NOT FUN AT ALL.

370
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,367
BUT THERE AIN'T NO CHANGING HER

371
00:09:17,367 --> 00:09:18,067
MIND.

372
00:09:18,067 --> 00:09:19,067
>> SO DO YOU THINK IT'S GONNA BE

373
00:09:19,067 --> 00:09:20,400
HARDER IF SHE MOVES IN TO DO

374
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,700
YOUR ABSTINENCE?

375
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,600
>> DEFINITELY.

376
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:23,600
BUT I DON'T KNOW.

377
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,133
IT'S GONNA BE EASIER TO RAISE

378
00:09:25,133 --> 00:09:25,867
A BABY.

379
00:09:25,867 --> 00:09:27,833
THE WAY I SEE IT,

380
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,100
I'M JUST PAYING MY DUES.

381
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,167
I'M JUST GONNA WAIT IT OUT

382
00:09:31,167 --> 00:09:33,100
AND HOPE THAT EVERYTHING WORKS

383
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,500
OUT THE WAY I'M PLANNING.

384
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,300
>> DO YOU PLAN ON DOING THIS

385
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:37,133
BECAUSE YOU HAVE THAT STRONG OF

386
00:09:37,133 --> 00:09:38,333
FEELINGS FOR COURTNEY,

387
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,600
OR IS IT BECAUSE YOU HAVE THAT

388
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:42,100
STRONG OF FEELINGS TO RAISE

389
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:44,067
A FAMILY, AND YOU DON'T WANT

390
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:45,600
TO JUST BE A WEEKEND DAD?

391
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,233
>> WELL, IT'S 'CAUSE I LOVE

392
00:09:47,233 --> 00:09:49,467
COURTNEY FOR COURTNEY.

393
00:09:51,933 --> 00:09:52,733
YOU DON'T JUST GIVE UP ON

394
00:09:52,733 --> 00:09:55,400
SOMETHING YOU LOVE.

395
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,200
AND THEN I ALSO DON'T WANT TO BE

396
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,200
A FAILURE OF A FATHER.

397
00:10:05,867 --> 00:10:07,200
>> TODAY, SCOTT AND I HAD

398
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,633
A SONOGRAM, AND WE FOUND OUT

399
00:10:08,633 --> 00:10:09,900
THAT OUR SON, DAYTON,

400
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,467
HAS A CLEFT LIP AND POSSIBLY

401
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:12,900
A CLEFT PALATE TOO.

402
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:14,233
THEY DON'T KNOW HOW BAD IT'S

403
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:15,333
GOING TO BE, BUT HE'LL

404
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:17,600
DEFINITELY HAVE TO HAVE SURGERY.

405
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,500
IT WAS HARD TO HOLD BACK TEARS.

406
00:10:29,433 --> 00:10:31,433
WHY ARE YOU SO QUIET?

407
00:10:33,567 --> 00:10:34,300
>> I DON'T KNOW.

408
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,333
I JUST THINK IT'S NOT GONNA BE

409
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,333
BAD JUST 'CAUSE IT TOOK FOUR

410
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,667
DOCTORS JUST TO SAY,

411
00:10:38,667 --> 00:10:39,900
"ALL RIGHT, YES, HE DOES HAVE

412
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,567
A CLEFT PALATE."

413
00:10:40,567 --> 00:10:41,467
>> BUT THEY CAN'T TELL HOW

414
00:10:41,467 --> 00:10:43,700
SEVERE IT IS UNTIL HE'S BORN.

415
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,600
>> YEAH.

416
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,500
I DON'T THINK IT'LL BE BAD.

417
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,500
I'M LOOKING AT THE POSITIVE.

418
00:10:51,567 --> 00:10:52,967
>> I'M JUST ASKING YOU TO KEEP

419
00:10:52,967 --> 00:10:54,867
AN OPEN MIND.

420
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:55,767
>> I JUST DON'T WANT TO LOOK AT

421
00:10:55,767 --> 00:10:56,467
THE NEGATIVE.

422
00:10:56,467 --> 00:10:57,267
>> I DON'T EITHER.

423
00:10:57,267 --> 00:10:58,333
THAT'S WHY I KEEP SAYING WE'RE

424
00:10:58,333 --> 00:10:59,000
BLESSED.

425
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,133
BUT I'M NOT--I'M KEEPING AN OPEN

426
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:02,233
MIND, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO

427
00:11:02,233 --> 00:11:04,100
HAVE AN IMAGE ALREADY IN MY

428
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,700
HEAD BECAUSE I DON'T WANT

429
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:09,700
TO EXPECT ANYTHING.

430
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,967
I'VE ALWAYS BEEN WORRIED ABOUT

431
00:11:18,967 --> 00:11:21,067
PASSING ON MY CLEFT LIP BECAUSE

432
00:11:21,067 --> 00:11:22,967
I INHERITED MINE FROM MY MOM,

433
00:11:22,967 --> 00:11:24,200
AND SINCE SHE WENT THROUGH THIS

434
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,767
WITH ME, SHE'S THE ONLY ONE

435
00:11:25,767 --> 00:11:27,067
WHO CAN UNDERSTAND HOW I'M

436
00:11:27,067 --> 00:11:27,767
FEELING.

437
00:11:27,767 --> 00:11:29,433
I FEEL LIKE A PART OF IT IS MY

438
00:11:29,433 --> 00:11:30,700
FAULT FOR PASSING ON

439
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:31,433
THE CLEFT LIP.

440
00:11:31,433 --> 00:11:32,200
>> I WENT THROUGH THAT.

441
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,433
I STILL GO THROUGH THAT.

442
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:34,367
>> YEAH.

443
00:11:34,367 --> 00:11:36,833
>> SO THAT GUILT--

444
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,067
>> DOESN'T GO AWAY.

445
00:11:38,067 --> 00:11:40,267
>> WELL, IT DOESN'T, BUT IT CAN

446
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:41,200
TEAR YOU UP, THOUGH,

447
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,067
IF YOU DON'T DEAL WITH IT.

448
00:11:43,067 --> 00:11:43,933
I MEAN, I KIND OF WORRY ABOUT

449
00:11:43,933 --> 00:11:45,667
THIS WITH YOU TOO, THAT WHEN

450
00:11:45,667 --> 00:11:47,433
THE BABY'S BORN, IT'S QUITE

451
00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:49,867
DIFFERENT WHEN YOU SEE THAT IN

452
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:50,533
PERSON.

453
00:11:50,533 --> 00:11:51,233
>> RIGHT.

454
00:11:51,233 --> 00:11:52,167
>> YOU'RE GONNA BE GOING THROUGH

455
00:11:52,167 --> 00:11:53,333
ALL KIND OF FEELINGS WHEN THAT

456
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,600
BABY'S BORN, AND I THINK THE

457
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,800
MOST THING THAT I WANT TO GET

458
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:56,467
THROUGH TO YOU IS,

459
00:11:56,467 --> 00:11:57,967
DON'T REJECT HIM.

460
00:11:57,967 --> 00:11:59,167
>> OH, I WOULD NEVER.

461
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:00,700
>> YOU NEED TO BOND WITH HIM,

462
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,367
NOT MATTER WHAT, AND I WOULD

463
00:12:02,367 --> 00:12:04,067
SUGGEST THAT YOU GUYS BE

464
00:12:04,067 --> 00:12:05,067
PREPARED.

465
00:12:05,067 --> 00:12:07,900
IT'S HARD BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT

466
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,967
THEY'RE GONNA FIX IT...

467
00:12:08,967 --> 00:12:09,633
>> MM-HMM.

468
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:10,933
>> BUT IT'S REALLY HARD TO

469
00:12:10,933 --> 00:12:12,433
VISUALIZE THAT WHEN THEY'RE

470
00:12:12,433 --> 00:12:14,267
BORN AND IT'S COMPLETELY OPEN.

471
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:15,600
>> RIGHT, AND THAT'S WHAT I KEEP

472
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,633
TELLING SCOTT, AND HE DOESN'T

473
00:12:16,633 --> 00:12:18,867
BELIEVE THAT--HE'S LIKE,

474
00:12:18,867 --> 00:12:20,067
"IT'S JUST A SCAR."

475
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:21,567
HE'S NOT UNDERSTANDING.

476
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:24,267
LIKE, HE THINKS THAT HE KNOWS

477
00:12:24,267 --> 00:12:26,200
EXACTLY HOW HE'S GONNA COME OUT.

478
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,400
>> WELL, AND HE PROBABLY HAS

479
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,233
SOMETHING IN HIS MIND, YOU KNOW

480
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:30,733
WHAT I MEAN, THAT, AFTER SEEING

481
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:31,800
THE ULTRASOUND.

482
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:33,700
I WOULD JUST SAY BE OPEN,

483
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,133
AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA TREAT HIM

484
00:12:35,133 --> 00:12:36,533
ANY DIFFERENT, YOU KNOW?

485
00:12:36,533 --> 00:12:37,967
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TREAT YOUR BABY

486
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:39,967
ANY DIFFERENT.

487
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:42,567
DON'T CRY.

488
00:12:42,567 --> 00:12:43,400
DON'T GO THERE.

489
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,233
YOU HAVE TO GIVE SOMEBODY TIME,

490
00:12:45,233 --> 00:12:46,100
AND YOU HAVE TO GIVE THEM A

491
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,100
CHANCE, AND SCOTT'S A GOOD KID.

492
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,833
BUT IT'S GONNA BE DIFFICULT.

493
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:50,900
YOU KNOW, IT MIGHT BE MORE OF

494
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,067
A LITTLE BIT OF A SHOCK FOR HIM,

495
00:12:52,067 --> 00:12:54,067
THOUGH.

496
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:07,867
>> I STILL HAVEN'T DECIDED

497
00:13:07,867 --> 00:13:09,133
WHETHER I WANT TO MOVE IN WITH

498
00:13:09,133 --> 00:13:09,800
SCOTT.

499
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,933
AND NOW THAT WE KNOW DAYTON HAS

500
00:13:10,933 --> 00:13:12,367
TO HAVE SURGERY, WE'RE PRETTY

501
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:14,367
STRESSED OUT ABOUT THE COST.

502
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:15,533
WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS APPLY FOR

503
00:13:15,533 --> 00:13:19,067
WIC, AND THEN HOPEFULLY APPLY

504
00:13:19,067 --> 00:13:20,067
FOR FOOD STAMPS.

505
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:21,633
IT'S GONNA BE ROUGH, BUT...

506
00:13:21,633 --> 00:13:22,567
>> WE'RE GONNA STRUGGLE.

507
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:23,433
>> OH, YEAH, WE'RE DEFINITELY

508
00:13:23,433 --> 00:13:25,400
GONNA STRUGGLE.

509
00:13:26,433 --> 00:13:27,633
>> WE CAN SAVE UP FOR THAT.

510
00:13:27,633 --> 00:13:28,300
I DON'T KNOW.

511
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,600
I THINK WE'LL BE FINE,

512
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,067
HONESTLY.

513
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:33,567
ASK, AND YOU SHALL RECEIVE.

514
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,800
GO IN GOD'S WAY.

515
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,667
GOD WILL PROVIDE.

516
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:38,600
>> AMEN.

517
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,767
>> THAT'S WHAT THEY SAID

518
00:13:40,767 --> 00:13:41,733
IN CHURCH.

519
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:43,167
>> GOD JOB PAYING ATTENTION.

520
00:13:43,167 --> 00:13:44,067
>> YEAH.

521
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:46,067
>> I'M PROUD OF YOU.

522
00:13:49,867 --> 00:13:50,900
>> I'VE ALWAYS LIKED FRIED

523
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,133
PICKLES, BUT EVER SINCE I GOT

524
00:13:52,133 --> 00:13:53,667
PREGNANT, I'VE WANTED THEM,

525
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,067
LIKE, EVERY SECOND.

526
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:55,767
>> THIS IS, LIKE, THE FOURTH

527
00:13:55,767 --> 00:13:56,567
TIME YOU'VE MADE THEM.

528
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:57,300
>> YEAH, BUT EVERY TIME,

529
00:13:57,300 --> 00:13:59,700
THEY GET BETTER AND BETTER.

530
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,767
LET'S EAT THESE.

531
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,333
THAT'S A GOOD PICKLE.

532
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,333
[giggles]

533
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:08,200
>> SO WHAT ELSE DO YOU GUYS HAVE

534
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:09,167
TO GET FIGURED OUT BEFORE THE

535
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:10,100
BABY COMES?

536
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,600
>> I HAVE TO FIND DOCTORS FOR

537
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,433
HIS SURGERY.

538
00:14:12,433 --> 00:14:14,300
I HAVE TO FIND OUT INSURANCE

539
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,067
STUFF.

540
00:14:15,067 --> 00:14:16,900
I HAVE TO...UGH.

541
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:18,467
FREAKING ME OUT, MAN.

542
00:14:18,467 --> 00:14:19,367
>> IT'S A LOT.

543
00:14:19,367 --> 00:14:20,433
ARE YOU DOING THE SURGERY RIGHT

544
00:14:20,433 --> 00:14:21,467
AFTER HE'S BORN, OR ARE YOU

545
00:14:21,467 --> 00:14:22,133
GONNA WAIT?

546
00:14:22,133 --> 00:14:23,067
>> WE DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THE

547
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:24,167
SURGERY'S GONNA BE.

548
00:14:24,167 --> 00:14:26,067
>> IT'S WORTH IT, YOU KNOW?

549
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:27,433
>> I'M JUST NERVOUS FOR HIM TO

550
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,067
GET, YOU KNOW, BULLIED A LITTLE

551
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:29,667
BIT.

552
00:14:29,667 --> 00:14:30,500
>> HE'S JUST GONNA HAVE

553
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,333
A LITTLE SCAR.

554
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,333
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S JUST GONNA

555
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:33,167
BE A SCAR.

556
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:35,167
IT'S GONNA BE--A CLEFT LIP

557
00:14:35,167 --> 00:14:37,133
IS JUST, LIKE--IT GOES UP.

558
00:14:37,133 --> 00:14:38,667
I'M SCARED THAT YOU'RE--

559

I FEEL LIKE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING

598
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,067
AT MY CLEFT LIP ALL THE TIME.

599
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:37,333
>> IT'S JUST NOT THAT BAD.

600
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,967
IT'S A THING IN THE PAST.

601
00:15:38,967 --> 00:15:41,433

IT'S HARD.

609
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,567
I DON'T LIKE FEELING DIFFERENT

610
00:15:54,567 --> 00:15:56,067

00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:51,800
MARRIED YOUNG.

747
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,200
>> NOW, DO YOU THINK THAT HE

748
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,767
MIGHT JUST WANT TO GET MARRIED

749
00:19:54,767 --> 00:19:55,667
TO HAVE SEX?

750
00:19:55,667 --> 00:19:56,700
>> HE WOULDN'T WANT TO GET

751
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,833

INTENTIONS.

753
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:00,067
I DON'T THINK.

754
00:20:00,067 --> 00:20:01,100
AND IF HE WANTED TO HAVE SEX

755
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,800
REALLY BAD, HE WOULD BREAK UP

756
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,000
WITH ME AND GO--

757
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,767
>> NO, HE WOULDN'T.

758
00:20:04,767 --> 00:20:05,833
HE'S HAVING A BABY WITH YOU.

759
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:06,633
>> HE WOULDN'T BE WITH ME

760
00:20:06,633 --> 00:20:08,000
JUST FOR A BABY.

761
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:08,900
>> YOU KNOW HOW YOU GUYS HAVE

762
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:09,767
SEPARATE ROOMS?

763
00:20:09,767 --> 00:20:10,967
HOW IS SCOTT GONNA WAKE UP IN

764
00:20:10,967 --> 00:20:11,667
THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

765
00:20:11,667 --> 00:20:13,400
AND TAKE TURNS WITH YOU?

766
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,600
>> I HAVE NO IDEA.

767
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:17,833
BEFORE SCOTT AND I COULD TALK

768
00:20:17,833 --> 00:20:19,767
ABOUT OUR PLAN, I STARTED HAVING

769
00:20:19,767 --> 00:20:22,167
REALLY PAINFUL CONTRACTIONS.

770
00:20:22,167 --> 00:20:23,600
I WASN'T SURE IF I SHOULD GO TO

771
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:25,333
THE HOSPITAL, SO I CALLED MY

772
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,467
DAD, AND HE CAME RIGHT OVER.

773
00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:29,433
>> YOU'RE GETTING CLOSE, GIRL.

774
00:20:29,433 --> 00:20:31,200
ALMOST TIME.

775
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,733
MR. DAYTON WANTS OUT.

776
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:33,833
HE DON'T WANT TO PLAY AROUND

777
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:34,733
IN THERE ANYMORE.

778
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,367
>> I'M SCARED FOR THE EPIDURAL.

779
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:38,700
>> YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE IT.

780
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,100
>> BUT I WANT IT.

781
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,367
>> OWIE.

782
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,367
>> LET'S GO.

00:20:52,533 --> 00:20:53,500
>> HEY, WE'RE HEADED TO THE

784
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,100

HER CONTRACTIONS ARE A MINUTE

786
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,500
AND A HALF APART.

787

OW.

789
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,067
THE NURSES MEASURED ME AT

790
00:21:06,067 --> 00:21:07,867
4 CENTIMETERS AND ADMITTED ME

791
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:09,200
RIGHT AWAY.

792
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,233
>> THAT'S GOOD.

793
00:21:10,233 --> 00:21:12,233
THAT'LL HELP A TON.

794
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:13,200

SUPER HARD.

1131
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,900

00:31:39,733 --> 00:31:42,067
LIKE, ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK,

1134

AND HE CAN'T GET UP WITH HIM IN

1135
00:31:43,267 --> 00:31:44,467
THE NIGHT BECAUSE I HAVE TO FEED

1136
00:31:44,467 --> 00:31:45,567

1137
00:31:45,567 --> 00:31:47,533
STRESSFUL, BECAUSE I WAKE UP

ALL THE TIME.

1157
00:32:14,067 --> 00:32:16,600
WHEN SCOTT GETS HOME, HE TAKES

1158
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,533
A SHOWER, EATS, AND THEN CHILLS

1159
00:32:20,533 --> 00:32:21,533
FOR A LITTLE BIT,

1160
00:32:21,533 --> 00:32:22,700
THEN GOES TO BED.

1161
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,733

WE DON'T REALLY GO OUT ON DATES.

1164
00:32:27,067 --> 00:32:28,667
WE LOST A LITTLE AFFECTION.

1165
00:32:28,667 --> 00:32:29,633
I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT, LIKE,

1166
00:32:29,633 --> 00:32:30,833
SEXUAL AFFECTION.

1167
00:32:30,833 --> 00:32:32,467
I'M TALKING, LIKE, YOU KNOW,

1168
00:32:32,467 --> 00:32:34,700
JUST HUGGING AND KISSING AND

1169
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,700
HOLDING HANDS, AND IT KIND OF

1170
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,067
FEELS LIKE WE'RE ROOMMATES NOW,

1171
00:32:38,067 --> 00:32:39,567
NOT BOYFRIEND AND GIRLFRIEND.

1172
00:32:39,567 --> 00:32:40,467
>> YEAH.

1173
00:32:40,467 --> 00:32:41,367
>> YEAH, I THINK THAT'S THE

1174
00:32:41,367 --> 00:32:43,233
HARDEST THING ABOUT HAVING

1175
00:32:43,233 --> 00:32:45,333
A BABY, IS KEEPING YOUR

1176
00:32:45,333 --> 00:32:48,333
RELATIONSHIP GOOD.

1177
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:49,333
'CAUSE RIGHT NOW, HE DOESN'T

1179
00:32:57,133 --> 00:32:58,767
SCOTT IS OFF TODAY, SO I ASKED

1180
00:32:58,767 --> 00:33:00,167

>> YOU'RE MAKING IT SEEM LIKE

1186
00:33:18,900 --> 00:33:20,067
I NEVER HOLD HIM.

1187
00:33:20,067 --> 00:33:20,867
WHY WOULDN'T I HOLD HIM?

1188
00:33:20,867 --> 00:33:21,667

SO I JUST TURNED TO GOD,

1383

1384
00:39:00,367 --> 00:39:01,067
