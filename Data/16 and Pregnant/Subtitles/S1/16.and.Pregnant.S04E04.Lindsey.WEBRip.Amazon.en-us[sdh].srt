00:00:15,683 --> 00:00:17,551
EVEN HAVE TO SHARE A BED.

HARD ON ME.

>> THAT'S WAY OVER YOUR PRICE.

21
00:00:33,501 --> 00:00:34,268
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

00:00:34,268 --> 00:00:36,170

00:00:43,877 --> 00:00:45,113
BACK, I'LL BE REALLY UPSET.

AND BECOMING A POLICE DETECTIVE.

41

00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:01,829
I'M ALSO TRAINING TO BECOME A

BUT ACHIEVING ALL MY DREAMS IS

46
00:01:06,534 --> 00:01:08,369
ABOUT TO GET A LOT HARDER,

47
00:01:08,369 --> 00:01:09,137

I'M ON SUMMER BREAK.

51
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:19,747
AND SINCE THE BABY IS DUE

52
00:01:19,747 --> 00:01:20,814
IN FOUR MONTHS, I'VE BEEN

60
00:01:28,522 --> 00:01:30,023
HOW'D YOU GET PREGNANT?

61
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:33,327
>> WELL, YOU HAVE SEX.

62
00:01:33,327 --> 00:01:34,362
>> YOU KNOW, THE REASON WHY THEY

63
00:01:34,362 --> 00:01:36,063
MAKE CONDOMS IS SO THAT WAY YOU

64
00:01:36,063 --> 00:01:37,165
CAN DO IT WITHOUT

65
00:01:37,165 --> 00:01:38,332

LIKE, WE REALLY DID.

00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:42,670
AND THEN--

00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,138
>> YOU GUYS JUST STOPPED?

71
00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:45,206
>> LIKE, WE--ONE TIME, WE DID IT

BEFORE WITHOUT A CONDOM,

73
00:01:46,274 --> 00:01:47,375
AND WE NEVER GOT PREGNANT.

74
00:01:47,375 --> 00:01:48,609
SO I KIND OF THOUGHT THAT I

75
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,510
COULDN'T GET PREGNANT FOR

76
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,211

>> THAT ONE TIME--

00:01:56,484 --> 00:01:57,551

84
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:59,453
"ARE YOU SERIOUS?"

85
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:00,188

99
00:02:13,167 --> 00:02:14,502

SHE FOUND OUT I WAS PREGNANT.

108
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:30,918

>> WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

>> I WANT YOU TO BE ABLE TO

00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:43,331
REACH YOUR GOALS.

119
00:02:43,331 --> 00:02:44,298

SEEM LIKE IT'S YOUR WAY

130
00:02:58,078 --> 00:02:58,912

STAY WITH HER, BUT THAT'S NOT

00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:38,752
GONNA BE EASY IF SHE KEEPS

159
00:03:38,752 --> 00:03:40,488
MAKING ME FEEL GUILTY ABOUT MY

160
00:03:40,488 --> 00:03:41,622
DECISION.

161
00:03:41,622 --> 00:03:43,524
ALSO, MY MOM'S HOUSE IS REALLY

162
00:03:43,524 --> 00:03:45,058
SMALL AND ABOUT A HALF HOUR AWAY

163
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,327
FROM FOREST, WHICH MAKES IT

164
00:03:46,327 --> 00:03:48,195
REALLY HARD FOR US TO SPEND TIME

165
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:49,062
TOGETHER.

166
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:49,763
[chime dings]

167
00:03:49,763 --> 00:03:51,098
WHEN I TOLD FOREST I WAS KEEPING

168
00:03:51,098 --> 00:03:52,933
THE BABY, HE WAS REALLY UPSET.

169
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,101
AND WE BROKE UP FOR A FEW

170
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:54,868
MONTHS.

171
00:03:54,868 --> 00:03:56,870
BUT NOW WE'RE BACK TOGETHER,

172
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:57,905
AND HE'S STARTING TO GET USED TO

173
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,540
THE IDEA OF BEING A DAD.

174
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,774
WE EVEN PICKED OUT A NAME FOR

175
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:05,413
HER, ANIYAH.

176
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:06,980
SO WHEN I FIRST TOLD YOU I WAS

177
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,482
PREGNANT, YOU WERE,

178
00:04:08,482 --> 00:04:10,150
LIKE, FURIOUS.

179
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:12,219
YOU WANTED NOTHING TO DO WITH ME

180
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:13,387
AND ALL THAT.

181
00:04:13,387 --> 00:04:15,088
AND ALL YOU WANTED WAS ME TO

182
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,657
GET OUT OF YOUR SIGHT AND FOR ME

183
00:04:16,657 --> 00:04:18,392
TO GET AN ABORTION.

184
00:04:18,392 --> 00:04:21,329
>> IT SEEMED AS IF YOU GOT

185
00:04:21,329 --> 00:04:24,298
PREGNANT TO KIND OF TIE ME DOWN.

186
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:25,733
AND I DIDN'T THINK IT'D BE

187
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:27,000
HEALTHY AT ALL FOR OUR

188
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,969

189
00:04:28,969 --> 00:04:31,104
FOR ME TO FELT FORCED INTO

190
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:32,606
SOMETHING THAT, LIKE--

191
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:33,874
THAT WASN'T EVEN THERE YET.

192
00:04:33,874 --> 00:04:34,942
>> I REALLY DID NOT THINK IT

193
00:04:34,942 --> 00:04:35,876
WOULD HAPPEN, AND THEN,

194
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:37,378
WHEN WE LEAST EXPECTED IT,

195
00:04:37,378 --> 00:04:38,779
IT HAPPENED.

196
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,981
JUST--IT'S SO EASY FOR EVERYBODY

197
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:42,015
ELSE TO SAY, "OH, YEAH.

198
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,050
JUST GO GET AN ABORTION."

199
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:43,817
AND IT'S LIKE,

200
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:45,819
"LIKE, WHO ARE YOU TO TELL ME TO

201
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:47,220
GET AN ABORTION?"

202
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:48,856
>> WELL, EVERYONE WAS JUST

203
00:04:48,856 --> 00:04:50,424
FREAKED OUT TRYING TO MAKE THE

204
00:04:50,424 --> 00:04:52,059
SMARTEST DECISION FOR YOU.

205
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:54,294
>> BUT REALLY, IT'S MY LIFE, AND

206
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,463
I KNOW IT DOES HAVE, LIKE--

207
00:04:55,463 --> 00:04:56,830
HAVE A BIG EFFECT ON OTHER

208
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,498
PEOPLE.

209
00:04:57,498 --> 00:04:58,632
>> AT FIRST, I WAS SO SCARED,

210
00:04:58,632 --> 00:05:00,133
I DIDN'T WANT TO THINK ABOUT IT.

211
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:01,001
AND THEN I KIND OF GOT

212
00:05:01,001 --> 00:05:01,735
USED TO IT.

213
00:05:01,735 --> 00:05:03,270
AND THEN MY GRANDMA AND MY AUNT

214
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,204
BROUGHT OVER SOME, LIKE,

215
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:05,305
BABY CHAIRS.

216
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,375
AND THEN IT REALLY HIT ME AGAIN.

217
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,342
AND I WAS SCARED.

218
00:05:08,342 --> 00:05:09,610
I ALMOST WANTED TO FAINT.

219
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:12,079
>> WELL, IF YOU JUST TRY

220
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:14,548
AND WE BOTH PUT IN AN EFFORT,

221
00:05:14,548 --> 00:05:16,950
THEN WE COULD BE HAPPIER.

222
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:17,585
YAY!

223
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:18,652
>> I GUESS I GOT TO START BUYING

224
00:05:18,652 --> 00:05:20,220
DIAPERS RIGHT NOW.

225
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,221
>> SO THEN WE DON'T HAVE TO BE

226
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:21,989
ALL STRESSED.

227
00:05:21,989 --> 00:05:24,024
>> AND GET TO BUY CLOTHES,

228
00:05:24,024 --> 00:05:24,758
ALL THAT.

229
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:26,259

231
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:30,030
IT'S NICE TO SEE FOREST AT LEAST

232
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:31,298
A LITTLE EXCITED ABOUT

233
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:32,533
THE BABY FOR ONCE.

234
00:05:32,533 --> 00:05:34,234
BUT IT'D BE EVEN BETTER IF HE'D

235
00:05:34,234 --> 00:05:37,004
STEP UP AND GET A JOB.

236

[chime dings]

237
00:05:38,305 --> 00:05:40,240
I'VE HAD TO MAKE SACRIFICES TOO.

238
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,442
I USED TO SPEND MY SUMMERS

239
00:05:41,442 --> 00:05:42,710
TRAINING FOR CAGE FIGHTING

240
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,811
MATCHES AND HANGING WITH

241
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:45,513
FRIENDS, BUT IT'S TOTALLY

242
00:05:45,513 --> 00:05:47,981
DIFFERENT NOW THAT I'M PREGNANT.

243
00:05:47,981 --> 00:05:49,917
>> WATCHING THE BASEBALL GAME.

244
00:05:49,917 --> 00:05:52,185

[laughs]

246
00:05:54,121 --> 00:05:56,189
ARE YOU STILL CAGE FIGHTING?

247
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:57,991
>> NO, RIGHT NOW I CAN'T,

248
00:05:57,991 --> 00:06:00,293
BECAUSE IT'S TOO MUCH OF A RISK.

249
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,229
SO AS MUCH AS I WANT TO STILL

250
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:04,197
CONTINUE CAGE FIGHTING, I NEED

251
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,533
TO PUT IT ON HOLD FOR AWHILE.

252
00:06:05,533 --> 00:06:07,234
AND THE BABY COMES FIRST.

253
00:06:07,234 --> 00:06:09,269
AND AS MUCH AS, LIKE, I WANT TO

254
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:10,871
GO PRO AS SOON AS I'M 18,

255
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,239
NOW THAT'S PUT OFF, LIKE,

256
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:13,306
ANOTHER YEAR OR TWO.

257
00:06:13,306 --> 00:06:15,809
>> SO WHAT DID YOUR TRAINER SAY

258
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:16,710
WHEN YOU GOT PREGNANT

259
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,778
AND HAD TO STOP?

260
00:06:17,778 --> 00:06:20,481
>> UM, I ACTUALLY HAVEN'T EVEN

261
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:21,649
TOLD MY TRAINER YET.

262
00:06:21,649 --> 00:06:22,650
>> YOU'RE STOPPED?

263
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:24,317
>> YEAH, I--'CAUSE HE'S LIKE A

264
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,686

266
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,220
HE WOULD SAY.

267

>> ARE YOU EVER GONNA TELL HIM?

268
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:30,123
>> WELL, I'M DEFINITELY GOING TO

269
00:06:30,123 --> 00:06:31,659
TELL HIM, BECAUSE ONCE I START

270
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:32,760
TRAINING AGAIN, I THINK IT WOULD

271
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:34,294
BE WAY MORE AWKWARD IF I JUST

272
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:35,195
SHOW UP WITH, LIKE,

273
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:35,996
A LITTLE BABY.

274
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:37,164

"WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

276
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:39,700
AND WHAT IS THAT BABY?"

I DON'T WANT HIM TO THINK I JUST

278
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,636
FLAKED OUT AND GAVE UP.

279
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:44,037
I CAN'T CAGE FIGHT.

280
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:46,306
I CAN'T HUNT.

281
00:06:46,306 --> 00:06:47,407
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING THAT I

282
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,509
NORMALLY WOULD DO.

00:06:53,947 --> 00:06:54,682
STOP IT.

289
00:06:54,682 --> 00:06:55,716
I'M SERIOUS, STOP.

290

>> I JUST DON'T LIKE TALKING

291
00:06:56,717 --> 00:06:57,718
ABOUT IT, BECAUSE IT'S, LIKE,

292
00:06:57,718 --> 00:06:59,820

OTHER GUYS THAT YOU TRAIN WITH

304
00:07:40,193 --> 00:07:40,928
AND EVERYTHING?

00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:07,948
AND SOMETIMES, I FEEL LIKE IT

376
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:09,449
WOULD MAKE SENSE FOR ME TO JUST

377
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:10,217
LIVE HERE.

378
00:09:10,217 --> 00:09:11,451
>> WHY ARE YOU DOING THE DISHES?

379
00:09:11,451 --> 00:09:15,088
>> BECAUSE I'M NESTING.

380
00:09:15,088 --> 00:09:16,189
>> I'M, LIKE, PREPARING FOR THE

381
00:09:16,189 --> 00:09:18,458
BABY.

382
00:09:23,631 --> 00:09:26,967
SO IT'S CRAZY HOW OUR

383
00:09:26,967 --> 00:09:28,669
RELATIONSHIP HAS BEEN,

384
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:31,004
THIS WHOLE TIME THAT I'VE BEEN

385
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:31,672
PREGNANT--

386
00:09:31,672 --> 00:09:32,673
>> YEAH.

387
00:09:32,673 --> 00:09:33,941
>> EVERY--EVERY DAY, LIKE,

388
00:09:33,941 --> 00:09:34,975
EVERY HOUR, I WAS JUST--

389
00:09:34,975 --> 00:09:37,110
I JUST KEPT, LIKE, PICTURING US

390
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:38,345
LIKE A LITTLE HAPPY FAMILY.

391
00:09:38,345 --> 00:09:39,947
AND I WAS LIKE, "I KNOW

392
00:09:39,947 --> 00:09:40,681
WE CAN DO IT."

393
00:09:40,681 --> 00:09:43,283
IF I MOVE IN, I THINK IT'LL BE

394
00:09:43,283 --> 00:09:45,819
THE BEST THING FOR OUR FAMILY.

395
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:47,855
>> I THINK IT WOULD BENEFIT US A

396
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:50,190
LOT, ESPECIALLY MONEY-WISE.

397
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:52,192
>> YEAH, BECAUSE THEN WE WON'T

398
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:53,593
HAVE TO BUY TWO OF EVERYTHING.

399
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,729
>> DIAPERS FOR ME,

400
00:09:55,729 --> 00:09:57,297
DIAPERS FOR YOU.

401
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:58,598
>> AND JUST, IT'S UNSTABLE

402
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,266
FOR ME.

403
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,100
>> YEAH.

404
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:01,034
>> AND ANIYAH.

405
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,469
I DON'T WANT ANIYAH TO--

406
00:10:02,469 --> 00:10:04,037
>> BE GOING BACK AND FORTH.

407
00:10:04,037 --> 00:10:05,072
>> YEAH, LIKE, I WANT HER TO

408
00:10:05,072 --> 00:10:07,374
KNOW SHE HAS A HOME.

409
00:10:07,374 --> 00:10:08,541
IT'S A BIG STEP

410
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,010
TO MOVE OUT OF MY HOME

411
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:11,044
WITH A GUY,

412
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:13,681
WITH A BABY FOR THE FIRST TIME.

413
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:15,382
>> WELL, NOW THAT ANIYAH IS IN

414
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:16,583
THE PICTURE,

415
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,752
IT'S EVEN MORE IMPORTANT.

416
00:10:18,752 --> 00:10:19,386
>> YEAH.

417
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:21,722
>> WE'RE GONNA HAVE A STRONG

418
00:10:21,722 --> 00:10:22,522
FAMILY.

419
00:10:22,522 --> 00:10:23,356
>> MM-HMM.

420
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:24,958
>> NOT ONE THAT JUST--

421
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,194
>> BACK AND FORTH AND DON'T KNOW

422
00:10:27,194 --> 00:10:28,195
IF WE WANT TO BE TOGETHER.

423
00:10:28,195 --> 00:10:29,362
>> ALWAYS...

424
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,197
>> both: FIGHTING.

425
00:10:30,197 --> 00:10:33,533
>> YEAH.

426
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:35,202
WELL, THERE'S A LOT MORE PROS...

427
00:10:35,202 --> 00:10:36,169
>> YEAH.

428
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:38,038
>> THAN CONS.

429
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,849
REGARDLESS OF WHERE I'M GONNA

430
00:10:48,849 --> 00:10:50,550
LIVE, WE HAVE TO START FIGURING

431
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,585
OUT WHAT WE NEED FOR ANIYAH.

432
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:01,061
>> DO YOU NEED ANY ASSISTANCE?

433
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:02,429
SO HOW MUCH ARE YOU LOOKING

434
00:11:02,429 --> 00:11:03,163
TO SPEND?

435
00:11:03,163 --> 00:11:04,564
>> UM, I THINK FOR, LIKE, ALL

436
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:06,099
THE SLEEPING MATERIAL,

437
00:11:06,099 --> 00:11:08,702
I'D SPEND, LIKE, $200.

438
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:09,837
>> AND THAT'S GONNA BE TOUGH TO

439
00:11:09,837 --> 00:11:10,603
GET INTO.

440
00:11:10,603 --> 00:11:12,005
>> OKAY, SO I'VE BEEN TAKING

441
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,140
NOTES, LIKE, TO SEE--

442
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:14,207
TO GET ORGANIZED.

443
00:11:14,207 --> 00:11:15,542
AND THE BASSINET WOULD BE

444
00:11:15,542 --> 00:11:19,179
$25 TO $80, THE CRIB ABOUT $200,

445
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:21,849
THE STROLLER, $60,

446
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,717
THE CLOTHES, $55,

447
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:24,651
AND THE PLAY SEAT

448
00:11:24,651 --> 00:11:25,753
ABOUT $60.

449
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:26,553
>> MM-HMM.

450
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:28,555
AND THEN YOU WOULD NEED THE,

451
00:11:28,555 --> 00:11:30,657
UM, CAR SEAT AS WELL.

452
00:11:30,657 --> 00:11:32,860
>> OH, YEAH, DEFINITELY.

453
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,561
AND CAR SEATS, HOW MUCH?

454
00:11:34,561 --> 00:11:35,695
>> BETWEEN $100 AND $200,

455
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,663
DEPENDING.

456
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:37,630
>> JUST ON A LITTLE CAR SEAT?

457
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,265
>> YEAH.

458
00:11:38,265 --> 00:11:38,932
[laughs]

459
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:39,867
>> OH, WOW.

460
00:11:39,867 --> 00:11:40,600
>> YEAH.

461
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,234
>> OKAY.

462
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:42,702
SO ALMOST, LIKE, $500

463
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:44,071
JUST FOR THAT STUFF.

464
00:11:44,071 --> 00:11:45,638
IT'S A LOT MORE THAN I PLANNED

465
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:49,109
TO SPEND JUST ON THAT.

466
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:50,844
NOW I NEED TO WORK MORE,

467
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:52,012
A LOT MORE.

468
00:11:52,012 --> 00:11:53,213
[laughs]

469
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:54,147
ALL RIGHT, WELL, THANK YOU

470
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:54,915
VERY MUCH.

471
00:11:54,915 --> 00:11:56,750
I APPRECIATE IT.

472
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:02,956
GETTING READY FOR THE BABY IS

473
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:04,557
GOING TO COST WAY MORE THAN I

474
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,458
THOUGHT.

475
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,094
AND MY PAYCHECK FROM WORK ISN'T

476
00:12:07,094 --> 00:12:08,595
REALLY GONNA CUT IT.

477
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:10,463
SO FOREST AND I ARE GONNA HAVE

478
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:12,732
TO WORK TOGETHER.

479
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:13,666
>> WHAT DO WE STILL NEED

480
00:12:13,666 --> 00:12:14,367
FOR THE BABY?

481
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:15,302
ARE YOU LOOKING AT, LIKE,

482
00:12:15,302 --> 00:12:16,536
THE CRIB, OR WHAT?

483
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:19,172
>> WELL, WE STILL NEED A LOT

484
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,373
ACTUALLY, LIKE, A LOT,

485
00:12:20,373 --> 00:12:22,409
ALMOST EVERYTHING.

486
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,610
WE HAVE THE MONEY TO GET

487
00:12:23,610 --> 00:12:25,145
THE CRIB, SO THAT'S THE NUMBER

488
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:27,280
ONE THING WE NEED TO GET.

489
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:31,952
WE NEED MORE CLOTHES, BOTTLES.

490
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:33,386
THERE'S A LOT.

491
00:12:33,386 --> 00:12:34,922
>> OH, WE GOT A LOT OF STUFF TO

492
00:12:34,922 --> 00:12:37,090
STILL BUY.

493
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:38,826
>> AND TIME IS ALMOST UP.

494
00:12:38,826 --> 00:12:39,559
>> OH, NO.

495
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,327
HOW MUCH LONGER,

496
00:12:40,327 --> 00:12:41,094
TWO MORE MONTHS?

497
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,996
>> YEAH.

498
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:45,232
THAT'S IF WE'RE LUCKY.

499
00:12:45,232 --> 00:12:46,233
YOU HAVE TO GET A JOB,

500
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:47,801
BECAUSE...

501
00:12:47,801 --> 00:12:49,236
I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO WORK

502
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:50,337
FOR SIX WEEKS AFTER

503
00:12:50,337 --> 00:12:51,371
THE BABY'S BORN.

504
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:53,206
>> YEAH.

505
00:12:54,274 --> 00:12:57,544
>> YEAH.

506
00:12:57,544 --> 00:12:58,946
I'M GLAD FOREST IS WILLING TO

507
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:00,547
GET A JOB, AND IT MAKES ME FEEL

508
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:04,084
GOOD ABOUT MOVING IN WITH HIM.

509
00:13:04,084 --> 00:13:05,785
BUT I'M NOT SO SURE MY FAMILY IS

510
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:10,557
GOING TO LIKE IT.

511
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:13,360
SO I'M THINKING OF TO MOVE IN

512
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:16,529
WITH FOREST.

513
00:13:16,529 --> 00:13:18,065
>> WHY DO YOU WANT TO DO THAT?

514
00:13:18,065 --> 00:13:19,399
>> MY ROOM IS KIND OF TOO SMALL

515
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:21,234
AT MOM'S HOUSE TO HAVE A CRIB

516
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:22,569
AND A BASSINET AND EVERYTHING

517
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:24,504
ELSE YOU NEED FOR A BABY.

518
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:25,505
AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT,

519
00:13:25,505 --> 00:13:27,174
WE'RE GONNA NEED TO HAVE DOUBLE

520
00:13:27,174 --> 00:13:27,908
OF EVERYTHING.

521
00:13:27,908 --> 00:13:29,009
IT'S GONNA BE LIKE WE'RE HAVING

522
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:29,609
TWINS.

523
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:32,079
SO WHY NOT JUST LIVE TOGETHER

524
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:34,047
AND BE ABLE TO BUY ONE OF

525
00:13:34,047 --> 00:13:34,948
EVERYTHING WE NEED?

526
00:13:34,948 --> 00:13:36,116
>> SO HAVE YOU TOLD MOM YOUR

527
00:13:36,116 --> 00:13:38,151
PLANS, WHAT YOU'RE WANTING

528
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:38,818
TO DO?

529
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,354
>> NO, NOT YET.

530
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:42,990
>> YOU BETTER TELL MOM SOON.

531
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:43,924
>> I'M ALREADY GONNA HAVE

532
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:45,225
STRESS OF A BABY AND COMPLETING

533
00:13:45,225 --> 00:13:46,459
SCHOOL AND EVERYTHING ELSE.

534
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:47,494
I DON'T NEED TO HEAR SOMEBODY

535
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,262
BITCH ABOUT ME AND MY DAUGHTER

536
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:50,397
LIVING SOMEWHERE.

537
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:52,900
>> DOES FOREST HAVE A JOB YET?

538
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,766
IS HE LOOKING FOR JOB?

539
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:55,835
>> YEAH, HE NEEDS TO GET A JOB.

540
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,304
>> YOU CAN'T TAKE CARE OF A BABY

541
00:13:57,304 --> 00:14:00,207
AND YOURSELF FROM WORKING AT

542
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:01,841
MCDONALD'S.

543
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:05,112
I HOPE THAT, YOU KNOW, THE BABY

544
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:06,746
WILL MAKE HIM REALIZE THAT THIS

545
00:14:06,746 --> 00:14:08,148
IS REAL LIFE, AND YOU DO HAVE TO

546
00:14:08,148 --> 00:14:10,083
STEP UP, BUT THAT'S NOT ALWAYS

547
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:11,784
THE CASE.

548
00:14:11,784 --> 00:14:13,620
>> I JUST WANT THINGS TO WORK

549
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,922
OUT SO MUCH THAT, LIKE--

550
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:15,688
I DON'T KNOW.

551
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,158
I HAVE A FEELING THEY WILL.

552
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,470
>> IT'S BEEN A WEEK SINCE FOREST

553
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,738
SAID HE'D GET A JOB, AND HE

554
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:33,907
STILL HASN'T STARTED LOOKING.

555
00:14:33,907 --> 00:14:35,608
IT'S FRUSTRATING, BECAUSE I'VE

556
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:36,843
BEEN WORKING A LOT OF LONG

557
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:38,145
SHIFTS, SOME OF THEM STARTING

558
00:14:38,145 --> 00:14:40,580
AT 6:00 A.M.

559
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,748
[chime dings]

560
00:14:41,748 --> 00:14:42,849
AND WHILE I'M SEVEN MONTHS

561
00:14:42,849 --> 00:14:44,684
PREGNANT AND WORKING, FOREST

562
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,619
WOULD RATHER LAY AROUND ALL DAY.

563
00:14:50,991 --> 00:14:52,392
AND I'M STARTING TO GET A LITTLE

564
00:14:52,392 --> 00:14:54,227
WORRIED.

565
00:14:58,966 --> 00:15:00,433
THANK YOU FOR DINNER, DORA.

566
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:01,268
>> THANK YOU.

567
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:03,336
>> YOU'RE WELCOME.

568
00:15:03,336 --> 00:15:06,173
FOREST ASKED ME IF HE COULD--

569
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,309
>> WE SHOULD.

570
00:15:09,309 --> 00:15:10,243
>> IT'S JUST NICE HAVING

571
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:10,910
YOU HERE.

572
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:11,911
IT'S--AND THE HELP.

573
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,113
YOU HELP ME WITH THE DISHES.

574
00:15:13,113 --> 00:15:14,347
I APPRECIATE THAT.

575
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:15,315
>> WELL, THANK YOU.

576
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:17,484
I ENJOY BEING HERE.

577
00:15:17,484 --> 00:15:19,586
I KNOW, LIKE, I'VE BEEN THE ONLY

578
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:20,287
ONE WORKING.

579
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:21,488
ARE YOU GONNA GET A JOB?

580
00:15:21,488 --> 00:15:23,256
>> YES, I'M GONNA GET A JOB,

581
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:23,923
BUT--

582
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:24,958
>> NOT NOW.

583
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,593
NOT UNTIL HE'S DONE WITH SCHOOL.

584
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:27,760
I DON'T WANT HIM WORKING AND

585
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,431
GOING TO SCHOOL AND BEING A DAD

586
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:32,465
AND TRYING TO DO HOMEWORK.

587
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:33,366
I THINK THAT'S TOO MUCH

588
00:15:33,366 --> 00:15:34,267
ON HIS PLATE.

589
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:35,068
SO...

590
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:36,469
>> I WOULDN'T WANT TO BE WORKING

591
00:15:36,469 --> 00:15:37,937
AT FAST-FOOD, FLIPPING BURGERS

592
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,273
OR ANYTHING, BECAUSE...

593
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,241
>> BUT I MEAN, AT LEAST

594
00:15:41,241 --> 00:15:42,809
I BRING HOME A CHECK.

595
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:44,177
>> BUT THAT'S ALSO WHY

596
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,012
YOU CAN LIVE HERE,

597
00:15:45,012 --> 00:15:46,980
BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO HELP YOU--

598
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,115
>> WELL, YEAH--

599
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,049
>> SO THAT YOU CAN STAY IN

600
00:15:49,049 --> 00:15:49,882
SCHOOL, AND YOU DON'T

601
00:15:49,882 --> 00:15:50,650
HAVE TO WORK.

602
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,651
>> AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THE

603
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:52,752
THING IS--IS WE'RE GONNA, WHAT?

604
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:53,853
STRUGGLE A LITTLE BIT UNTIL THE

605
00:15:53,853 --> 00:15:55,355
TIME I GET A JOB IN SUMMER,

606
00:15:55,355 --> 00:15:58,258
AND THEN I'LL HAVE, LIKE,

607
00:15:58,258 --> 00:15:58,992
DIPLOMA.

608
00:15:58,992 --> 00:15:59,826
I CAN GET A GOOD JOB

609
00:15:59,826 --> 00:16:01,128
AND NOT JUST SOMETHING STUPID.

610
00:16:01,128 --> 00:16:02,929
I CAN ACTUALLY GET THE MONEY TO

611
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:03,796
SUPPORT A FAMILY,

612
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:05,498
NOT JUST SOMETHING THAT CAN HELP

613
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:09,469
OUR FOOD ON THE TABLE.

614
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:10,670
>> I'M REALLY NOT HAPPY THAT

615
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:13,140
FOREST ISN'T GOING TO GET A JOB.

616
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,907
[chime dings]

617
00:16:14,907 --> 00:16:16,609
AND AFTER I LEFT HIS HOUSE, WE

618
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:18,345
ARGUED ON THE PHONE FOR AWHILE.

619
00:16:18,345 --> 00:16:20,313
AND IT ENDED WITH HIM

620
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:22,215
HANGING UP ON ME.

621
00:16:25,718 --> 00:16:26,986
IT SUCKS THAT WE'RE FIGHTING

622
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:28,321
AGAIN AFTER WE WERE DOING SO

623
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:29,656
WELL FOR AWHILE.

624
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:31,091
AND THE TIMING COULDN'T BE ANY

625
00:16:31,091 --> 00:16:33,326
WORSE, BECAUSE LATER THAT NIGHT,

626
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,727
SOMETHING FELT WEIRD.

627
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:35,995
MOM!

628
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,697
>> WHAT?

629
00:16:37,697 --> 00:16:39,499
>> COME DOWN HERE.

630
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,234
>> WHAT'S UP, SWEETHEART?

631
00:16:41,234 --> 00:16:42,402
>> I THINK I'M HAVING

632
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:44,237
CONTRACTIONS.

633
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:47,440
LET'S GO TO THE HOSPITAL.

634
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:50,043
OKAY?

635
00:16:50,043 --> 00:16:52,011
HERE, HONEY.

636
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,880
>> [groans]

637
00:16:55,615 --> 00:16:57,917
MY DUE DATE IS TWO MONTHS AWAY,

638
00:16:57,917 --> 00:16:59,086
SO I'M REALLY WORRIED,

639
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:00,153
AND FOREST WON'T ANSWER

640
00:17:00,153 --> 00:17:00,953
HIS PHONE.

641
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:03,556
[line ringing]

642
00:17:07,127 --> 00:17:08,695
WHEN I TOLD THE HOSPITAL STAFF

643
00:17:08,695 --> 00:17:10,397
I WAS HAVING CONTRACTIONS,

644
00:17:10,397 --> 00:17:11,364
THEY ADMITTED ME.

645
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:13,066
AND IT'S REALLY SCARY TO THINK I

646
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:14,867
MIGHT GO INTO LABOR THIS EARLY.

647
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,436
>> SIT DOWN.

648
00:17:16,436 --> 00:17:17,504
AND DO THIS.

649
00:17:17,504 --> 00:17:18,638
NOW I'M FINALLY GETTING

650
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:19,939
NERVOUS.

651
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,808
>> [sighs]

652
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:25,545
THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE 61 DAYS

653
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,414
LEFT.

654
00:17:31,818 --> 00:17:34,487
FOREST HASN'T CALLED YET.

655
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:51,838
>> I'M STILL IN THE HOSPITAL

656
00:17:51,838 --> 00:17:53,240
WAITING TO FIND OUT IF THESE

657
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,707
CONTRACTIONS MEAN I COULD BE

658
00:17:54,707 --> 00:17:56,276
GOING INTO LABOR EARLY.

659
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:58,044
>> SO HOW ARE YOU?

660
00:17:58,044 --> 00:17:59,879
HOW--DO YOU FEEL CRAMPY?

661
00:17:59,879 --> 00:18:02,048
>> YEAH, AND I FEEL HOT.

662
00:18:02,048 --> 00:18:03,015
AND I JUST DON'T FEEL GOOD.

663
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:06,186
>> OKAY.

664
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:06,953
SO YOU'RE AT RISK

665
00:18:06,953 --> 00:18:08,155
FOR PRETERM LABOR.

666
00:18:08,155 --> 00:18:09,589
SO I'M GONNA MONITOR YOUR BABY,

667
00:18:09,589 --> 00:18:10,490
SEE IF YOU'RE HAVING ANY

668
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:11,858
CONTRACTIONS, AND WE'LL GET YOU

669
00:18:11,858 --> 00:18:12,559
THAT SHOT.

670
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:13,293
>> TOMORROW?

671
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:14,127
>> TOMORROW, YEAH.

672
00:18:14,127 --> 00:18:15,128
>> WHAT EXACTLY IS,

673
00:18:15,128 --> 00:18:15,862
LIKE, THE SHOT?

674
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:16,563
WHAT IS IT--

675
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:17,797
>> IT'S CALLED BETAMETHASONE.

676
00:18:17,797 --> 00:18:19,098
AND IT'S A STEROID.

677
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:21,501
AND IT'S USED TO HELP DEVELOP

678
00:18:21,501 --> 00:18:23,436
THE BABY'S LUNGS.

679
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:26,072
IF YOU DELIVER BEFORE 36 WEEKS,

680
00:18:26,072 --> 00:18:27,440
THERE IS THE CHANCE THAT YOUR

681
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,409
BABY'S LUNG MIGHT NOT BE MATURE.

682
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:42,789
>> MY FEELINGS ARE HURT.

683
00:18:48,595 --> 00:18:49,796
THE DOCTORS ARE WORRIED ABOUT

684
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:51,030
WHAT'LL HAPPEN IF I HAVE THE

685
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,365
BABY THIS EARLY, AND THEY WANT

686
00:18:52,365 --> 00:18:56,503
TO KEEP ME OVERNIGHT.

687
00:18:56,503 --> 00:18:58,104
MY MOM HAD TO LEAVE FOR WORK.

688
00:18:58,104 --> 00:18:59,606
AND FOREST STILL HASN'T CALLED

689
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:01,474
ME BACK.

690
00:19:09,282 --> 00:19:10,850
IN THE MORNING, MY CONTRACTIONS

691
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:11,984
HAD MOSTLY STOPPED,

692
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,085
AND I WAS FEELING BETTER.

693
00:19:13,085 --> 00:19:14,787
BUT I'M STILL PRETTY FRUSTRATED

694
00:19:14,787 --> 00:19:17,257
ABOUT FOREST NOT SHOWING UP.

695
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:18,291
>> HE HASN'T TRIED CALLING OR

696
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:20,260
TEXTING YOU OR ANYTHING?

697
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,160
>> NO.

698
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,231
HE OBVIOUSLY DOESN'T CARE.

699
00:19:24,231 --> 00:19:25,565
WELL, WHATEVER HE'S DOING,

700
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:27,066
IT'S--NOTHING IS MORE IMPORTANT

701
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:27,867
THAN HIS CHILD.

702
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:28,768
>> YEAH, IT IS.

703
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:29,769
>> SHE HAS TO GET A SHOT TO

704
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:31,238
MAKE HER LUNGS DEVELOP FASTER,

705
00:19:31,238 --> 00:19:33,240
BECAUSE SHE COULD COME ANY DAY

706
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,006
NOW.

707
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:36,643
LIKE, DOES HE NOT CARE THAT THIS

708
00:19:36,643 --> 00:19:37,510
COULD AFFECT--

709
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:39,879
>> MAYBE HE'S RUNNING FROM IT.

710
00:19:39,879 --> 00:19:41,514
LIKE, SINCE IT'S GETTING SO MUCH

711
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:42,449
CLOSER TO THE TIME,

712
00:19:42,449 --> 00:19:44,484
HE'S GETTING MORE AFRAID.

713
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:46,152
>> YEAH, WELL, GROW THE [bleep]

714
00:19:46,152 --> 00:19:47,587
UP.

715
00:19:47,587 --> 00:19:50,957
SO...

716
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:51,624
>> SORRY.

717
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:53,260
OKAY.

718
00:19:53,260 --> 00:19:55,662
GIVE YOU THE SHOT.

719
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:57,864
ALL RIGHT, MY DEAR, ROLL OVER.

720
00:20:02,001 --> 00:20:03,803
>> OW.

721
00:20:03,803 --> 00:20:05,071
>> RIGHT NOW, LINDSEY, DON'T PUT

722
00:20:05,071 --> 00:20:05,905
YOUR HAND BACK THERE.

723
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:08,475
>> OW.

724
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:10,510
>> GOOD TO GO.

725
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,780
YOUR INSTRUCTIONS ARE BED REST--

726
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,647
>> ONLY UP TO SHOWER.

727
00:20:14,647 --> 00:20:15,748
>> NO SCHOOL.

728
00:20:15,748 --> 00:20:17,216
UP TO SHOWER, UP TO EAT,

729
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,117
KIND OF BASIC.

730
00:20:18,117 --> 00:20:19,151
YOU'LL BE ON THE COUCH.

731
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,787
WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE ANY CHANCES

732
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:22,555
WITH YOU.

733
00:20:22,555 --> 00:20:23,256
ALL RIGHT?

734
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:25,091
>> I'M READY TO GO.

735
00:20:31,197 --> 00:20:33,032
SINCE MY MOM HAD TO WORK, MY

736
00:20:33,032 --> 00:20:34,200
SISTER DALLAS CAME TO DRIVE ME

737
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,603
HOME.

738
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:37,870
>> BUT I'M SERIOUS.

739
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:38,871
LIKE, WHAT'S GOING ON WITH YOU

740
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:39,539
AND FOREST?

741
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:40,640
>> THE OTHER DAY WHEN I WENT TO

742
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,708
THE HOSPITAL, HE DIDN'T EVEN

743
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,010
RETURN MY CALL.

744
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,645
LIKE, I LEFT HIM A VOICEMAIL.

745
00:20:45,645 --> 00:20:46,346
I TEXTED HIM.

746
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:47,380
AND I CALLED HIM ABOUT HOW I WAS

747
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,214
IN THE HOSPITAL.

748
00:20:48,214 --> 00:20:50,249
HE NEVER EVEN CALLED TO ASK WHY

749
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:51,518
I WAS THERE OR ANYTHING.

750
00:20:51,518 --> 00:20:52,319
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?

751
00:20:52,319 --> 00:20:53,986
>> HE HASN'T BEEN

752
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:54,921
THERE TO HELP ME.

753
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,289
HE HASN'T CALLED TO SEE IF I'M

754
00:20:56,289 --> 00:20:58,758
OKAY, IF I NEED ANYTHING.

755
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,793
>> WHAT AN ASS[bleep].

756
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:02,529
>> I WORK MY ASS OFF.

757
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:04,063
YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE A JOB.

758
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:05,164
I'M THE PREGNANT GIRLFRIEND

759
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:06,433
GOING TO WORK AT, LIKE,

760
00:21:06,433 --> 00:21:07,266
5:00 IN THE MORNING,

761
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,168
AT 12:00 AT NIGHT,

762
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:10,236
NOT EVEN GETTING OFF UNTIL THE

763
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:12,505
MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT.

764
00:21:12,505 --> 00:21:14,507
AND I GET NOTHING IN RETURN.

765
00:21:14,507 --> 00:21:16,676
LIKE, I'M KIND OF JUST, LIKE,

766
00:21:16,676 --> 00:21:18,077
DONE IN A WAY.

767
00:21:18,077 --> 00:21:20,480
>> THAT'S GOOD.

768
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:21,581
I REALLY DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD

769
00:21:21,581 --> 00:21:22,382
BE WITH HIM AT ALL,

770
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:23,516
'CAUSE THAT'S [bleep] UP.

771
00:21:23,516 --> 00:21:24,917
LIKE, YOU DESERVE WAY

772
00:21:24,917 --> 00:21:26,285
BETTER THAN THAT.

773
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:27,687
LIKE, YOU'RE HAVING HIS KID, AND

774
00:21:27,687 --> 00:21:29,021
HE'S NOT EVEN...

775
00:21:29,021 --> 00:21:30,323
THAT'S SO MESSED UP.

776
00:21:30,323 --> 00:21:31,458
IT'S LIKE HE DOESN'T APPRECIATE

777
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,125
YOU AT ALL.

778
00:21:45,538 --> 00:21:47,273
>> TODAY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE MY

779
00:21:47,273 --> 00:21:48,941
FIRST DAY BACK AT SCHOOL, BUT

780
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:50,410
BECAUSE I'M ON BED REST, I HAVE

781
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:53,413
TO DO ALL MY WORK ONLINE.

782
00:21:53,413 --> 00:21:54,614
>> SO DO YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA

783
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:56,516
BE ABLE TO DO THE MATH ONLINE,

784
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:57,484
OR ARE YOU GONNA NEED HELP,

785
00:21:57,484 --> 00:21:58,150
SWEETHEART?

786
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,819
>> I CAN DO IT.

787
00:22:03,155 --> 00:22:04,991
IT ALSO MEANS I CAN'T GO TO

788
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,393
WORK, WHICH REALLY SUCKS,

789
00:22:06,393 --> 00:22:07,760
BECAUSE NOW I'M NEVER GONNA BE

790
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,396
ABLE TO SAVE UP FOR ALL THE BABY

791
00:22:09,396 --> 00:22:11,030
STUFF WE NEED.

792
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:12,432
AND FOREST STILL HASN'T EVEN

793
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:14,300
CALLED TO SEE HOW I'M DOING.

794
00:22:22,542 --> 00:22:23,476
>> AT THE TONE,

795
00:22:23,476 --> 00:22:24,611
PLEASE RECORD YOUR MESSAGE.

796
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:25,378
[phone beeps]

797
00:22:25,378 --> 00:22:27,414
>> OKAY, WELL, SINCE YOU CAN'T

798
00:22:27,414 --> 00:22:29,882
BE MATURE AND TALK ABOUT THIS

799
00:22:29,882 --> 00:22:33,052
AND BE CIVIL LIKE YOU SAY--

800
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:34,253
YOU WOULDN'T EVEN CALL ME BACK

801
00:22:34,253 --> 00:22:35,121
WHEN I HAD TO GO TO THE

802
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:35,922
HOSPITAL.

803
00:22:35,922 --> 00:22:37,790
AND YOU'RE NOT EVEN TRYING TO

804
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,792
GET A JOB, SO YOU'RE REALLY

805
00:22:39,792 --> 00:22:41,293
UNMOTIVATED, AND YOU NEED TO GET

806
00:22:41,293 --> 00:22:42,261
YOUR [bleep] TOGETHER.

807
00:22:42,261 --> 00:22:44,531
AND UNTIL THEN,

808
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:46,065
I'M NOT IN YOUR LIFE.

809
00:22:46,065 --> 00:22:47,900
AND I'M DONE.

810
00:22:51,003 --> 00:22:52,004
[sad instrumental music]

811

* *

812
00:23:14,694 --> 00:23:17,296
>> OKAY.

813
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:19,198
THINGS ARE SO BAD WITH FOREST,

814
00:23:19,198 --> 00:23:20,366
AND IT'S MAKING ME MISS

815
00:23:20,366 --> 00:23:22,234
MY OLD LIFE.

816
00:23:29,842 --> 00:23:31,077
BUT WHEN I FINALLY GOT A TEXT

817
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:32,311
FROM FOREST APOLOGIZING,

818
00:23:32,311 --> 00:23:33,880
IT WAS HARD TO IGNORE.

819
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,347
HE SAID HE MISSES ME AND WAS

820
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:36,549
JUST FREAKING OUT ABOUT US

821
00:23:36,549 --> 00:23:37,784
BECOMING PARENTS.

822
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:39,719
AND EVEN THOUGH I'M ON BED REST,

823
00:23:39,719 --> 00:23:41,253
I AGREED TO GO OVER THERE AND

824
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:43,122
HEAR WHAT HE HAD TO SAY.

825
00:23:48,394 --> 00:23:52,198
HI.

826
00:23:52,198 --> 00:23:53,600
>> YOU OKAY?

827
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,702
>> I REMEMBER, I WAS IN THE

828
00:23:55,702 --> 00:23:58,204
HOSPITAL, BECAUSE I STARTED

829
00:23:58,204 --> 00:23:59,205
GETTING CONTRACTIONS,

830
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:00,206
SO I HAD TO GO.

831
00:24:00,206 --> 00:24:02,408
AND THEN, THEY HAD TO GIVE ME A

832
00:24:02,408 --> 00:24:03,409
SHOT, BECAUSE I COULD HAVE HAD

833
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:04,544
HER WAY EARLY.

834
00:24:04,544 --> 00:24:05,678
AND SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN

835
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:06,613
THE ICU.

836
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:08,447
>> YOU--I KNOW YOU THINK IT WAS

837
00:24:08,447 --> 00:24:10,349
ALL BAD ON YOU, BUT HERE I AM.

838
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:11,551
AND IT'S LIKE, "OH, I'M GONNA BE

839
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:12,619
A FATHER NOW.

840
00:24:12,619 --> 00:24:14,554
LIKE, JUST BEING FOREST,

841
00:24:14,554 --> 00:24:15,922
YOU HAVE TO GROW UP NOW."

842
00:24:15,922 --> 00:24:16,956
FOREST, IT'S LIKE,

843
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:17,757
"HERE'S YOUR KID."

844
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:19,526
AND SO WHEN I DID DITCH YOU AT

845
00:24:19,526 --> 00:24:21,393
THE HOSPITAL, IT WASN'T BECAUSE

846
00:24:21,393 --> 00:24:24,430
I WAS TRYING TO BE MEAN OR

847
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,598
ANYTHING, BUT I FELT

848
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:27,534
I CAN GROW UP ON MY OWN TOO.

849
00:24:27,534 --> 00:24:29,135
>> I JUST WANTED YOU TO BE THERE

850
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:29,836
FOR ME.

851
00:24:29,836 --> 00:24:31,137
>> WELL, I AM SORRY.

852
00:24:31,137 --> 00:24:32,505
AND I WANT TO HAVE A GREAT

853
00:24:32,505 --> 00:24:34,741
FAMILY, SO...

854
00:24:34,741 --> 00:24:36,042
DO YOU WANT TO WORK ON THIS

855
00:24:36,042 --> 00:24:37,443
AND GET BACK TOGETHER?

856
00:24:37,443 --> 00:24:38,745
>> AS LONG AS WE TREAT EACH

857
00:24:38,745 --> 00:24:41,480
OTHER WITH RESPECT.

858
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:42,148
>> OKAY.

859
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:43,215
>> AND THAT'S THE ONLY WAY I

860
00:24:43,215 --> 00:24:44,917
COULD BE WITH YOU.

861
00:24:44,917 --> 00:24:46,553
>> WE SHOULD TRY

862
00:24:46,553 --> 00:24:47,486
AND MAKE THINGS WORK.

863
00:24:47,486 --> 00:24:49,622
IT IS GONNA BENEFIT, LIKE, US

864
00:24:49,622 --> 00:24:50,823
BEING AROUND EACH OTHER AND YOU

865
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:52,825
LIVING HERE AND RAISE A DAUGHTER

866
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:56,428
IN A HEALTHY FAMILY.

867
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,030
>> I'M GLAD FOREST SEES WHAT HE

868
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:59,599
DID WAS WRONG AND WANTS US TO BE

869
00:24:59,599 --> 00:25:00,967
TOGETHER AS A FAMILY.

870
00:25:00,967 --> 00:25:02,569
SO I THINK IT'D BE BEST IF I

871
00:25:02,569 --> 00:25:03,670
LIVED WITH HIM ONCE THE BABY

872
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,572
COMES.

873
00:25:11,778 --> 00:25:14,013
>> HEY, HONEY.

874
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:16,482
WHAT'S GOING ON?

875
00:25:16,482 --> 00:25:19,852
>> WELL, I AM GOING TO

876
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:22,254
MOVE IN WITH FOREST.

877
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:23,255
>> WHEN?

878
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:25,257
>> AS SOON AS THE BABY'S BORN.

879
00:25:25,257 --> 00:25:27,727
LIKE, I'LL MOVE IN WITH THEM

880
00:25:27,727 --> 00:25:28,795
AT THEIR HOUSE.

881
00:25:28,795 --> 00:25:29,796
>> AND WHY DO YOU THINK THAT'S

882
00:25:29,796 --> 00:25:30,563
SUCH A GOOD IDEA?

883
00:25:30,563 --> 00:25:31,831
>> I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

884
00:25:31,831 --> 00:25:34,734
WE RAISE ANIYAH AS A FAMILY.

885
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:37,604
I WANT FOREST AND I TO WORK ON

886
00:25:37,604 --> 00:25:38,605
OUR RELATIONSHIP.

887
00:25:38,605 --> 00:25:39,606
>> SO I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT--

888
00:25:39,606 --> 00:25:40,607
AFTER THE BABY'S BORN, DO YOU

889
00:25:40,607 --> 00:25:41,941
THINK HE'S GONNA HELP?

890
00:25:41,941 --> 00:25:42,875
DO YOU THINK HE'S GONNA BE

891
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:43,576
RESPONSIBLE?

892
00:25:43,576 --> 00:25:45,311
BECAUSE SO FAR, I MEAN, OFF AND

893
00:25:45,311 --> 00:25:46,212
ON, HE'S BEEN PRETTY

894
00:25:46,212 --> 00:25:47,213
IRRESPONSIBLE.

895
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:48,480
>> HIM NOT COMING TO THE

896
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,782
HOSPITAL WITH ME, YOU KNOW, THAT

897
00:25:49,782 --> 00:25:51,150
WAS NOT OKAY AT ALL.

898
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:52,251
>> DID HE SAY HE WAS SORRY AND

899
00:25:52,251 --> 00:25:53,185
HE WAS GONNA STEP UP AND

900
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:54,153
BE RESPONSIBLE?

901
00:25:54,153 --> 00:25:55,087
>> YEAH, HE SAID THAT.

902
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:56,155
>> STILL, IT'S HARD.

903
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:57,423
WHEN I WORK, I'M NOT GONNA BE

904
00:25:57,423 --> 00:25:58,557
ABLE TO SEE YOU AND ANIYAH

905
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,026
HARDLY AT ALL.

906
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:01,260
>> I MEAN, I KIND OF HAVE TO

907
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,995
GROW UP.

908
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:04,463
I'M NOT GONNA BE WITH YOU

909
00:26:04,463 --> 00:26:05,131
FOREVER.

910
00:26:05,131 --> 00:26:06,465
>> YEAH, LINDSEY, I WANT TO TELL

911
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:07,099
YOU THIS.

912
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:08,034
YOU'RE PREGNANT RIGHT NOW,

913
00:26:08,034 --> 00:26:09,636
AND SOMEDAY, WHEN ANIYAH IS 17

914
00:26:09,636 --> 00:26:11,037
YEARS OLD, I PRAY SHE'S NOT

915
00:26:11,037 --> 00:26:12,104
DOING THIS TO YOU,

916
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:15,174
BECAUSE IT'S HARD.

917
00:26:15,174 --> 00:26:16,108
YOU'RE STILL MY BABY.

918
00:26:16,108 --> 00:26:17,409
>> I KNOW THAT.

919
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:18,410
>> I DON'T THINK IT'S A GREAT

920
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,579
IDEA.

921
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,981
>> I UNDERSTAND WHERE MY MOM'S

922
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:23,850
COMING FROM, BUT MY MIND'S MADE

923
00:26:23,850 --> 00:26:25,718
UP.

924
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:33,359
AND A FEW HOURS LATER...

925
00:26:33,359 --> 00:26:34,661
MY WATER JUST BROKE, AND I'VE

926
00:26:34,661 --> 00:26:36,062
BEEN HAVING CONTRACTIONS,

927
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:38,330
AND I'M IN A LOT OF PAIN.

928
00:26:38,330 --> 00:26:39,699
I'M GOING TO THE HOSPITAL RIGHT

929
00:26:39,699 --> 00:26:41,934
NOW.

930
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:45,905
>> OH, NO, I AM POSITIVE.

931
00:26:45,905 --> 00:26:48,040
I'M ONLY 36 WEEKS, SO I'M

932
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,541
NERVOUS THAT ANIYAH'S LUNGS

933
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:51,177
WON'T BE FULLY DEVELOPED.

934

00:33:01,647 --> 00:33:06,018
>> HOW ARE YOU, SWEETIE?

1119
00:33:06,018 --> 00:33:10,256
>> YOU WAKING UP?

1120
00:33:10,256 --> 00:33:12,424
HI, BABY.

1121
00:33:12,424 --> 00:33:13,225
>> CAN I HOLD HER?

1122
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:13,892
>> MM-HMM.

1123
00:33:13,892 --> 00:33:14,860
YOU WANT THE BOTTLE?

1124
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,228
>> YOU KNOW, I WASN'T READY, BUT

1125
00:33:16,228 --> 00:33:17,396
I WOULDN'T TRADE IT FOR ANYTHING

1126
00:33:17,396 --> 00:33:18,864
IN THE WORLD.

1127
00:33:18,864 --> 00:33:21,133
ANYWAY, I'M REALLY SORRY ABOUT

1128
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:22,134
WHAT HAPPENED AT THE HOSPITAL

1129
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:22,968
AND EVERYTHING.

1130
00:33:22,968 --> 00:33:23,969
>> ME TOO.

1131
00:33:23,969 --> 00:33:25,271
>> IT WAS UGLY.

1132
00:33:25,271 --> 00:33:26,138
IT WAS SUCH A BEAUTIFUL

1133
00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:27,306
EXPERIENCE BEING THERE THROUGH

1134
00:33:27,306 --> 00:33:29,441
THE BIRTH AND THEN, ALL OF A

1135
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:30,409
SUDDEN, IT JUST ALL WENT TO

1136
00:33:30,409 --> 00:33:31,177
HECK, YOU KNOW?

1137
00:33:31,177 --> 00:33:31,977
>> MM-HMM.

1138
00:33:31,977 --> 00:33:33,912
>> I DON'T FEEL GOOD ABOUT THAT

1139
00:33:33,912 --> 00:33:37,349
AT ALL, BUT HOPEFULLY WE CAN

1140
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:38,984
MOVE ON FROM HERE.

1141
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:39,651
YOU THINK?

1142
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:41,487
>> WELL, I'M WILLING TO WORK ON

1143
00:33:41,487 --> 00:33:45,057
US.

1144
00:33:45,057 --> 00:33:46,292
>> ME TOO.

1145
00:33:46,292 --> 00:33:47,393
BECAUSE I LOVE YOU, AND I LOVE

1146
00:33:47,393 --> 00:33:48,194
THIS GRANDDAUGHTER

1147
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:49,061
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

1148
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:50,662
AND I WANT TO BE A PART OF BOTH

1149
00:33:50,662 --> 00:33:51,497
OF YOUR LIVES.

1150
00:33:51,497 --> 00:33:53,599
>> YOU ARE AND ALWAYS WILL BE.

1151
00:33:58,804 --> 00:34:00,606
AFTER DINNER, MY MOM SUGGESTED

1152
00:34:00,606 --> 00:34:01,840
THAT WE GO SEE MY TRAINER,

1153
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:03,309
BECAUSE I'VE REALLY BEEN MISSING

1154
00:34:03,309 --> 00:34:05,244
CAGE FIGHTING.

1155
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:10,382
I'M REALLY SCARED.

1156
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:11,650
>> COME ON.

1157
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:12,784
DO YOU WANT ME TO WALK IN IN

1158
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,019
FRONT OF YOU OR BEHIND YOU?

1159
00:34:14,019 --> 00:34:14,820
>> YEAH, IN FRONT.

1160
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:16,588
>> OKAY.

1161
00:34:35,207 --> 00:34:36,275
>> KEEP THAT HAND UP WHEN

1162
00:34:36,275 --> 00:34:38,110
YOU KICK.

1163
00:34:42,348 --> 00:34:43,014
HOLY MOLY.

1164
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:44,450
WHO'S THIS HERE?

1165
00:34:44,450 --> 00:34:45,451
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER IN FOREVER.

1166
00:34:45,451 --> 00:34:46,118
>> I KNOW.

1167
00:34:46,118 --> 00:34:46,918
THAT STRANGER, HUH?

1168
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:47,619
THE STRANGER.

1169
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:48,987
>> WHAT WAS YOUR NAME AGAIN?

1170
00:34:48,987 --> 00:34:49,855
>> [laughs]

1171
00:34:49,855 --> 00:34:52,691
OH, NO, DON'T CRY.

1172
00:34:52,691 --> 00:34:53,859
YOU'LL MAKE ME CRY.

1173
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:54,560
STOP IT.

1174
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:55,361
>> I MISS LINDSEY.

1175
00:34:55,361 --> 00:34:57,163
>> I MISS YOU.

1176
00:34:57,163 --> 00:34:57,996
>> THIS IS ANIYAH.

1177
00:34:57,996 --> 00:34:59,398
>> ANIYAH.

1178
00:34:59,398 --> 00:35:01,967
>> THIS IS LINDSEY'S BABY.

1179
00:35:04,403 --> 00:35:05,471
>> IT'S WHY I'M BRINGING THE

1180
00:35:05,471 --> 00:35:07,038
BABY, 'CAUSE I WANT TO LIKE--

1181
00:35:07,038 --> 00:35:08,340
I MISS THE GYM.

1182
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,375
AND I MISS YOU.

1183
00:35:09,375 --> 00:35:10,442
THIS HAS BEEN THE REASON I

1184
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:11,343
HAVEN'T BEEN HERE.

1185
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:13,312
AND I WANTED TO TELL YOU, BUT IT

1186
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:14,346
WAS JUST SO HARD.

1187
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:16,248
LIKE, EVERY TIME I WOULD DRIVE

1188
00:35:16,248 --> 00:35:17,816
BY, I JUST WANTED TO COME, BUT

1189
00:35:17,816 --> 00:35:19,885
THEN I WAS, LIKE, JUST SO SCARED

1190
00:35:19,885 --> 00:35:20,686
OF WHAT YOU WOULD,

1191
00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:21,653
LIKE, SAY, AND...

1192
00:35:21,653 --> 00:35:22,321
[sniffles]

1193
00:35:22,321 --> 00:35:24,623
>> WELL, YOU CAN TELL ME STUFF.

1194
00:35:24,623 --> 00:35:26,124
YEAH, THAT MAKES ME FEEL BAD.

1195
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,693
YOU COULD HAVE COME BY AND...

1196
00:35:27,693 --> 00:35:31,363
>> HERE YOU GO, SWEETIE.

1197
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:33,965
>> SO DO YOU THINK IF I WORK MY

1198
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:36,235
BUTT OFF, I COULD STILL GO PRO

1199
00:35:36,235 --> 00:35:37,803
LIKE WE HAD PLANNED?

1200
00:35:37,803 --> 00:35:38,770
>> WELL, I MEAN, IT'S GONNA

1201
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:39,405
BE HARD.

1202
00:35:39,405 --> 00:35:40,439
THAT'S THE ONE THING YOU HAVE TO

1203
00:35:40,439 --> 00:35:42,408
UNDERSTAND.

1204
00:35:42,408 --> 00:35:44,042
I THINK YOU CAN GO PRO FOR SURE.

1205
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:45,344
>> YAY.

1206
00:35:45,344 --> 00:35:46,278
>> YEAH, YOU'RE ONE OF THE

1207
00:35:46,278 --> 00:35:47,179
TOUGHEST GIRLS I'VE MET.

1208
00:35:47,179 --> 00:35:47,913
>> SEE, ANIYAH?

1209
00:35:47,913 --> 00:35:49,448
YOU CAN BE HERE WATCHING ME.

1210
00:35:49,448 --> 00:35:50,349
>> [laughs]

1211
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:51,850
>> WHEN YOU OPEN YOUR EYES,

1212
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:55,120
IF YOU EVER PLAN ON IT.

1213
00:35:58,056 --> 00:35:59,558
I AGREED TO START TRAINING FOUR

1214
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:00,426
DAYS A WEEK.

1215
00:36:00,426 --> 00:36:01,760
BUT I'M GOING TO HAVE TO FIGURE

1216
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,262
OUT HOW TO MAKE IT WORK ON TOP

1217
00:36:03,262 --> 00:36:08,667
OF MY ALREADY HECTIC SCHEDULE.

1218
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:10,402
I WANTED TO HAVE A LITTLE BREAK.

1219
00:36:10,402 --> 00:36:12,404
>> OH.

1220
00:36:12,404 --> 00:36:13,272
IS IT HARD FOR YOU?

1221
00:36:13,272 --> 00:36:15,274
WHAT DO YOU DO EVERY DAY?

1222
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:16,908
>> I'M, LIKE, UP ALMOST ALL

1223
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:18,244
NIGHT WITH THE BABY.

1224
00:36:18,244 --> 00:36:21,447
AND THEN I TAKE CARE OF HER

1225
00:36:21,447 --> 00:36:22,581
ALL DAY.

1226
00:36:22,581 --> 00:36:23,549
>> ARE YOU GONNA WANT TO GET

1227
00:36:23,549 --> 00:36:24,450
BACK INTO CAGE FIGHTING?

1228
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,917
>> YEAH, DEFINITELY.

1229
00:36:25,917 --> 00:36:28,186
THAT'S--I WANT TO BECOME

1230
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:30,522
A PROFESSIONAL.

1231
00:36:30,522 --> 00:36:31,990
BUT I'M GONNA HAVE TO PAY

1232
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:33,459
FOR IT.

1233
00:36:33,459 --> 00:36:34,326
>> HOW MUCH DOES CAGE

1234
00:36:34,326 --> 00:36:35,060
FIGHTING COST?

1235
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,395
>> 80 BUCKS.

1236
00:36:36,395 --> 00:36:37,429
>> 80 BUCKS...

1237
00:36:37,429 --> 00:36:38,196
>> A MONTH.

1238
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:38,864
>> A MONTH?

1239
00:36:38,864 --> 00:36:41,333
SO THERE'S ANOTHER BILL ON TOP

1240
00:36:41,333 --> 00:36:43,369
OF EVERYTHING.

1241
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:45,404
IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE A LOT, BUT

1242
00:36:45,404 --> 00:36:47,473
IT'S GOING TO BE HARD IF YOU

1243
00:36:47,473 --> 00:36:49,375
DON'T HAVE MONEY COMING FROM

1244
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:51,943
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

1245
00:36:51,943 --> 00:36:55,481
WHY ISN'T FOREST WORKING?

1246
00:36:55,481 --> 00:36:56,748
>> THERE'S NOBODY THERE PUSHING

1247
00:36:56,748 --> 00:36:57,849
HIM TO MOVE FORWARD.

1248
00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:00,552
LIKE, I TELL HIM MY PART, AND

1249
00:37:00,552 --> 00:37:02,888
HIS MOM BACKS HIM UP.

1250
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:03,822
HIS MOM DOESN'T MAKE HIM

1251
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:05,724
GET A JOB.

1252
00:37:05,724 --> 00:37:08,694
>> IF I WERE FOREST, I WOULD BE

1253
00:37:08,694 --> 00:37:09,528
VERY EMBARRASSED.

1254
00:37:09,528 --> 00:37:11,162
>> I'M JUST WORRIED...

1255
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:12,264
>> I DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU SHOULD

1256
00:37:12,264 --> 00:37:13,832
BE DOING EVERYTHING.

1257
00:37:22,674 --> 00:37:24,142
>> DON'T GO AWAY.

1258
00:37:24,142 --> 00:37:25,277
THIS EPISODE OF 16 AND PREGNANT 

1259
00:37:25,277 --> 00:37:26,878
CONTINUES RIGHT NOW.

1260
00:37:34,853 --> 00:37:36,254
[baby fussing]

1261
00:37:36,254 --> 00:37:40,225
>> IT'S OKAY, MAMA.

1262
00:37:40,225 --> 00:37:42,227
HOW WAS IT, SEEING TRAINER

1263
00:37:42,227 --> 00:37:43,128
AGAIN--RICK?

1264
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:45,263
>> IT WAS REALLY GOOD, ACTUALLY.

1265
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,433
IT FELT LIKE KIND OF A BIG

1266
00:37:47,433 --> 00:37:50,536
RELIEF OFF ME.

1267
00:37:50,536 --> 00:37:51,970
IT'S GIVEN ME SO MUCH MORE

1268
00:37:51,970 --> 00:37:53,772
MOTIVATION TO, LIKE, REALLY GET

1269
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:55,707
BACK INTO CAGE FIGHTING, BECAUSE

1270
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:56,675
I WANT TO GO PRO

1271
00:37:56,675 --> 00:37:57,709
WHEN I TURN 18.

1272
00:37:57,709 --> 00:37:59,177
>> WHEN DO YOU GO TO TRAINING?

1273
00:37:59,177 --> 00:38:00,379
>> EVERY OTHER DAY.

1274
00:38:00,379 --> 00:38:01,847
>> EVERY OTHER DAY?

1275
00:38:01,847 --> 00:38:02,648
>> YEAH.

1276
00:38:02,648 --> 00:38:04,149
>> SO MONDAY, WEDNESDAY,

1277
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:05,617
AND FRIDAY?

1278
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:07,853
>> AND SATURDAY.

1279
00:38:07,853 --> 00:38:08,920
>> AND SATURDAY?

1280
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:09,788
>> YEAH.

1281
00:38:09,788 --> 00:38:11,457
>> DANG.

1282
00:38:11,457 --> 00:38:12,758
>> IT'S JUST CRAZY HOW FAST

1283
00:38:12,758 --> 00:38:13,859
MONEY GOES BY, LIKE,

1284
00:38:13,859 --> 00:38:18,497
WITH DOCTOR BILLS.

1285
00:38:18,497 --> 00:38:21,066
WE'RE GONNA NEED KIND OF A LOT.

1286
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:22,167
I KNOW, LIKE, YOU WANT TO GET A

1287
00:38:22,167 --> 00:38:23,569
JOB AS SOON AS YOU GRADUATE.

1288
00:38:23,569 --> 00:38:24,570
IS IT JUST 'CAUSE YOU WANT TO

1289
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:25,571
CONCENTRATE ON SCHOOL?

1290
00:38:25,571 --> 00:38:27,406
>> I KNOW IF I JUGGLE SCHOOL AND

1291
00:38:27,406 --> 00:38:29,307
WORK, I'M GONNA F--

1292
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:30,876
MESS UP IN SCHOOL.

1293
00:38:30,876 --> 00:38:33,011
>> I UNDERSTAND HOW YOU FEEL

1294
00:38:33,011 --> 00:38:36,147
ABOUT STRESSING ABOUT SCHOOL.

1295
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:39,017
BUT IT'S ALSO STRESSFUL

1296
00:38:39,017 --> 00:38:40,051
FOR ME TOO.

1297
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:41,152
I HATE HAVING TO ASK PEOPLE FOR

1298
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,120
MONEY.

1299
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,555
AND PLUS, I WANT TO HELP OUT A

1300
00:38:43,555 --> 00:38:46,224
LOT AROUND HERE.

1301
00:38:46,224 --> 00:38:48,927
SO YOU ONLY WANT ME TO WORK.

1302
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:50,996
>> IF YOU DO, BALANCE IT GOOD.

1303
00:38:50,996 --> 00:38:53,231
>> MY SCHEDULE IS GOING TO BE

1304
00:38:53,231 --> 00:38:55,634
WATCH ANIYAH ALL DAY,

1305
00:38:55,634 --> 00:38:57,469
DO SCHOOL ALL DAY,

1306
00:38:57,469 --> 00:38:58,604
YOU COME HOME,

1307
00:38:58,604 --> 00:39:01,540
I GET READY TO GO TO TRAIN.

1308
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:04,576
THEN THE DAYS THAT I DON'T

1309
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:06,945
TRAIN, YOU COME HOME, I GET

1310
00:39:06,945 --> 00:39:08,947
READY, YOU TAKE ME TO WORK.

1311
00:39:08,947 --> 00:39:10,348
AND THEN YOU PICK ME UP AT

1312
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,383
MIDNIGHT.

1313
00:39:11,383 --> 00:39:12,283
YOU'RE GONNA BE WATCHING

1314
00:39:12,283 --> 00:39:14,119
HER A LOT.

1315
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,332
FOREST DOESN'T WANT TO GET A JOB

1316
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:28,734
UNTIL HE GRADUATES.

1317
00:39:28,734 --> 00:39:30,001
IT'S NOT OKAY.

1318
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:32,471
BUT HE'S STUCK BY MY SIDE

1319
00:39:32,471 --> 00:39:33,605
AND ANIYAH'S SIDE.

1320
00:39:33,605 --> 00:39:34,740
>> IT'S OKAY, BABY.

1321
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,574
[laughs]

1322
00:39:35,574 --> 00:39:36,408
>> HOW ARE YOU GUYS?

1323
00:39:36,408 --> 00:39:37,443
HI, HONEY.

1324
00:39:37,443 --> 00:39:38,109
>> HI, MOM.

1325
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:38,844
>> I LOVE YOU.

1326
00:39:38,844 --> 00:39:39,945
>> IT FELT GOOD TO MAKE UP WITH

1327
00:39:39,945 --> 00:39:40,546
MY MOM.

1328
00:39:40,546 --> 00:39:41,480
WE REALLY LOVE EACH OTHER.

1329
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:43,048
AND WE'VE JUST BEEN THROUGH SO

1330
00:39:43,048 --> 00:39:44,315
MUCH TOGETHER.

1331
00:39:44,315 --> 00:39:46,084
I LIKE THAT YOU COME OVER, BUT I

1332
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:48,386
WISH YOU COULD COME OVER MORE.

1333
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,955
MY FIRST TIME BACK AT CAGE

1334
00:39:49,955 --> 00:39:52,323
FIGHTING WAS PRETTY INTENSE.

1335
00:39:52,323 --> 00:39:53,191
>> BEEN AWHILE, HUH?

1336
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:54,460
>> YEAH, IT'S LIKE I ALMOST

1337
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,293
FORGOT WHAT TO DO.

1338
00:39:55,293 --> 00:39:57,763
>> LET'S GO, LINDSEY.

1339
00:39:57,763 --> 00:39:59,330
>> ONE YEAR OF NO TRAINING PUT

1340
00:39:59,330 --> 00:40:03,735
ME BACK SO FAR.

1341
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,370
MY GOAL IS TO JUST GET BACK IN

1342
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:07,405
SHAPE 100% SO THAT I CAN BECOME

1343
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,341
THE FIGHTER I WANT TO BE.

1344
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:12,210
I KNOW THAT I GOT MYSELF INTO A

1345
00:40:12,210 --> 00:40:15,447
LOT WITH HAVING TO BE A MOM 24/7

1346
00:40:15,447 --> 00:40:17,115
AND STILL TRY TO BECOME A

1347
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:20,251
PROFESSIONAL CAGE FIGHTER.

1348
00:40:20,251 --> 00:40:21,920
I WOULD DO ANYTHING TO BE OUT OF

1349
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,221
SCHOOL ALREADY AND HAVE A CAREER

1350
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:25,991
AND HAVE MY OWN HOME.

1351
00:40:25,991 --> 00:40:27,826
I JUST WISH I WOULD HAVE WAITED.

1352
00:40:27,826 --> 00:40:28,694
[chime dings]

1353
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:43,308
>> ON THE NEXT

1354
00:40:43,308 --> 00:40:44,610
 16 AND PREGNANT. 

1355
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:46,044
>> I KNOW WHAT'S BEST.

1356
00:40:46,044 --> 00:40:47,245
>> AND WHAT IS THAT?

1357
00:40:47,245 --> 00:40:48,814
>> ADOPTION.

1358
00:40:48,814 --> 00:40:50,816
I JUST DON'T WANT TO NOT TRY.

1359
00:40:50,816 --> 00:40:52,083
>> WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO?

1360
00:40:52,083 --> 00:40:54,252
>> I CAN'T ON MY OWN.

1361
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:56,087
MATT!

1362
00:40:56,087 --> 00:40:57,322
>> WHAT?

1363
00:40:57,322 --> 00:40:59,190
>> YOU ARE NOTHING!

1364
00:40:59,190 --> 00:40:59,991
AND GO HANG OUT

1365
00:40:59,991 --> 00:41:02,393
WITH YOUR CRACKHEAD FRIEND.
