ON THE SHOW, YOU SAW MACI

17
00:00:39,067 --> 00:00:40,600
AND RYAN'S WEDDING PLANS

18
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,700
DISSOLVE, BUT TODAY YOU'LL SEE

19
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:43,833
SOME OTHER MOMENTS THAT

20
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:45,000
CONTRIBUTED TO THEIR

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:45,967
WEDDING WOES.

22
00:00:45,967 --> 00:00:47,300
YOU SAW CATELYNN AND TYLER

23
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,367
CHOOSE ADOPTION, BUT TODAY

00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:52,100

00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:52,933
MUCH MORE.

27
00:00:52,933 --> 00:00:54,100
IT'S THE CHRONICLES OF

28
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:55,733
WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN IT'S ALL

29
00:00:55,733 --> 00:00:57,933
UNEXPECTED.

30
00:00:57,933 --> 00:01:00,367
FIRST UP, A REALITY CHECK.

31
00:01:00,367 --> 00:01:02,167
LET'S START WITH MACI AND

32
00:01:02,167 --> 00:01:03,533
TAKE A LOOK AT HOW PREGNANCY

33
00:01:03,533 --> 00:01:06,400
REWROTE HER WEDDING PLANS.

34
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,733
>> OKAY, I WANT A MERMAID DRESS.

35
00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:09,467
>> WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

36
00:01:09,467 --> 00:01:10,367
>> PLAIN WHITE.

37
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:11,200
I WANT ALL PLAIN WHITE.

38
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,633
I DON'T WANT ANY DIAMONDS.

39
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:14,433
>> WHAT'S "MERMAID" MEAN?

40
00:01:14,433 --> 00:01:16,833
>> LIKE THAT, JUST PLAIN WHITE,

41
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:18,400
THAT KIND ALL THE WAY--

42
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,500
>> SO YOU ARE, LIKE, FOR SURE

43
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:21,067
GETTING MARRIED STILL?

44
00:01:21,067 --> 00:01:22,633
>> IF WE GOT MARRIED, WE WOULD

45
00:01:22,633 --> 00:01:24,067
ACTUALLY FEEL THE COMMITMENT

46
00:01:24,067 --> 00:01:24,933
TOWARDS EACH OTHER,

47
00:01:24,933 --> 00:01:26,133
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

48
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:27,067
>> BUT JUST GETTING THERE IS,

49
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:28,067
LIKE, HARD.

50
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:28,667
>> RIGHT.

51
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:29,467
>> LET'S GO TRY DRESSES ON

52
00:01:29,467 --> 00:01:30,367
NOW, BECAUSE--

53
00:01:30,367 --> 00:01:31,267
>> YOU MEAN ME GO TRY

54
00:01:31,267 --> 00:01:31,933
DRESSES ON?

55
00:01:31,933 --> 00:01:34,400
>> YEAH.

56
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,667
>> ISN'T IT PRETTY?

57
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:37,733
>> OHH.

58
00:01:37,733 --> 00:01:40,500
>> HOW WEIRD.

59
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,167
>> IT'S CRAZY.

60
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:42,333
>> I'VE GOT TO GO TO WORK, MACI.

61
00:01:42,333 --> 00:01:43,167
>> OKAY.

62
00:01:43,167 --> 00:01:44,300
WELL, I DON'T REALLY WANT

63
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,067
TO TAKE IT OFF.

64
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:47,633
>> OKAY.

65
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:49,933
>> BUT AFTER BENTLEY WAS BORN,

66
00:01:49,933 --> 00:01:51,100
MACI AND RYAN'S RELATIONSHIP

67
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,733
GOT ONLY ROCKIER, AND MONEY

68
00:01:52,733 --> 00:01:54,833
STARTED GETTING EVEN TIGHTER.

69
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:58,333
>> HELLO, FAT BOY.

70
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:01,333
SO I CALLED THAT COUNTRY CLUB

71
00:02:01,333 --> 00:02:02,700
PLACE IN CLEVELAND THAT ME

72
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,800
AND RYAN WANTED TO GET MARRIED

73
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,100
AT, YOU KNOW?

74
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,767
>> YEAH.

75
00:02:05,767 --> 00:02:06,933
>> SHE ASKED ME WHAT DATE

76
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:08,433
WE WERE LOOKING AT, AND I TOLD

77
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:09,700
HER VALENTINE'S DAY,

78
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:12,767
AND SHE SAID THAT THEY DON'T

79
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:14,900
HAVE THAT DAY OPEN, AND

80
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,333
THE NEXT DAY IN FEBRUARY

81
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:18,900
IS THE 28TH.

82
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,700
>> WELL, WE'VE GOT TO COVER

83
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:22,467
ALL THE BILLS FROM HIS DELIVERY.

84
00:02:22,467 --> 00:02:25,267
WE'VE GOT CHRISTMAS COMING UP,

85
00:02:25,267 --> 00:02:28,700
YOUR GRADUATION.

86
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:32,567
>> SO WHEN CAN WE?

87
00:02:32,567 --> 00:02:33,833
>> MAYBE WE COULD JUST MAKE IT

88
00:02:33,833 --> 00:02:35,633
A BEACH WEDDING.

89
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:37,067
>> THAT WOULD ALMOST BE CHEAPER

90
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:39,833
THAN A REGULAR WEDDING, THOUGH,

91
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:42,867
BECAUSE, I MEAN, RYAN COULD WEAR

92
00:02:42,867 --> 00:02:45,800
KHAKIS AND A BUTTON-DOWN,

93
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,267
AND I COULD WEAR, LIKE, A WHITE

94
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,433
SUNDRESS OR SOMETHING AND BE

95
00:02:49,433 --> 00:02:51,733
BAREFOOTED OR WEAR FLIP-FLOPS.

96
00:02:51,733 --> 00:02:53,233
>> I STILL DON'T KNOW IF WE'RE

97
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:54,200
GONNA HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO

98
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,067
PULL EVERYTHING OFF.

99
00:02:56,067 --> 00:02:57,067
I DON'T KNOW; MAYBE WE NEED TO

100
00:02:57,067 --> 00:02:59,167
PUSH IT ON INTO THE SPRING

101
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:00,133
SOMEWHERE.

102
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:02,167
>> THE 14TH IS VALENTINE'S DAY,

103
00:03:02,167 --> 00:03:03,333
AND IT WAS OUR ANNIVERSARY

104
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:07,333
OR WHATEVER, BUT, UM...

105
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,567
'CAUSE IF WE CAN'T GET THAT

106
00:03:08,567 --> 00:03:10,433
DATE AND WE CAN'T GET IT

107
00:03:10,433 --> 00:03:12,933
ANY EARLIER, THEN THERE'S NO

108
00:03:12,933 --> 00:03:15,800
POINT IN TRYING TO RUSH IT.

109
00:03:16,167 --> 00:03:17,433
>> FARRAH, AS YOU SAW ON THE

110
00:03:17,433 --> 00:03:19,200
SHOW, LOVES THE LIMELIGHT.

111
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,467
IN FACT, SHE'S ALWAYS IMAGINED

112
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:21,933
SHE'D END UP A MODEL OR EVEN

113
00:03:21,933 --> 00:03:23,133
A BEAUTY QUEEN.

114
00:03:23,133 --> 00:03:24,833
BUT SINGLE MOTHERHOOD IS GOING

115
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,567
TO MAKE IT VERY HARD FOR FARRAH

116
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:27,800
TO FIND HER WAY BACK

117
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:32,233
TO THE SPOTLIGHT.

118
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:33,600
>> I WAS, LIKE, WONDERING IN

119
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:36,167
DENIAL FOR, LIKE, MAYBE A MONTH.

120
00:03:36,167 --> 00:03:37,433
I WAS JUST QUESTIONING BECAUSE

121
00:03:37,433 --> 00:03:38,233
I NOTICED, LIKE, MY BODY

122
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:39,067
WAS CHANGING.

123
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:39,700
>> YEAH.

124
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:40,867
>> MY FRIEND HILDA AND I WENT

125
00:03:40,867 --> 00:03:43,233
TO PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND GOT

126
00:03:43,233 --> 00:03:44,867
A PREGNANCY TEST.

127
00:03:44,867 --> 00:03:49,167
AND SO, UM, I HAD THAT HAPPEN,

128
00:03:49,167 --> 00:03:50,200
AND THE LADY TOLD ME I WAS

129
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,233
PREGNANT, AND I COMPLETELY WAS

130
00:03:52,233 --> 00:03:53,767
PISSED, AND--

131
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:54,667
>> DID YOU CRY?

132
00:03:54,667 --> 00:03:56,067
>> NO, I DIDN'T REALLY CRY.

133
00:03:56,067 --> 00:03:57,067
I JUST SCREAMED AT HER,

134
00:03:57,067 --> 00:03:57,833
AND THEN--

135
00:03:57,833 --> 00:03:59,433
>> WHY DID YOU SCREAM AT HER?

136
00:03:59,433 --> 00:04:00,767
IT'S YOUR PROBLEM, NOT HERS.

137
00:04:00,767 --> 00:04:01,667
>> I JUST SCREAMED AT HER,

138
00:04:01,667 --> 00:04:02,967
AND ANYWAYS--

139
00:04:02,967 --> 00:04:03,633
>> DID YOU HAVE A SEX TALK

140
00:04:03,633 --> 00:04:04,300
WITH HER?

141
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:04,967
DID YOU?

142
00:04:04,967 --> 00:04:07,433
>> NO, SHE WAS TOO SCARED.

143
00:04:07,433 --> 00:04:08,100
>> DID YOU ASK ABOUT IT

144
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:08,767
WHEN YOU WERE YOUNGER?

145
00:04:08,767 --> 00:04:10,167
>> FARRAH NEVER LISTENS.

146
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,600
SHE NEVER LISTENS.

147
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,633
>> WHAT HURT MORE, KNOWING THAT

148
00:04:12,633 --> 00:04:13,467
YOUR DAUGHTER WAS PREGNANT

149
00:04:13,467 --> 00:04:14,167
OR THAT YOU WERE GONNA BE

150
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:15,533
A GILF?

151
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:16,433
DO YOU KNOW WHAT A GILF IS?

152
00:04:16,433 --> 00:04:17,400
>> THE PROBLEM--THE PROBLEM--

153
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,067
>> WHAT'S A GILF?

154
00:04:18,067 --> 00:04:18,733
I WANT TO KNOW.

155
00:04:18,733 --> 00:04:19,467
>> INSTEAD OF A MILF, THINK

156
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,233
ABOUT IT WITH A "G," GRANDMA.

157
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:23,067
>> GRANDMA I'D LIKE TO...OKAY.

158
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:24,267
>> THE PROBLEM IS, YOU HAVE

159
00:04:24,267 --> 00:04:26,467
GREAT ASPIRATIONS FOR YOUR

160
00:04:26,467 --> 00:04:27,700
CHILDREN, AND YOU POUR

161
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,567
EVERYTHING INTO THEM, RIGHT?

162
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:31,500
SO KIND OF THE IRONY: THE DAY

163
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,867
SHE HAD THE BABY...

164
00:04:32,867 --> 00:04:33,833
>> OH, MY GOD, MOM.

165
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:36,067
>> SHE GOT A LETTER IN THE MAIL

166
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,900
TO BE PART OF THE MISS AMERICA

167
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:39,500
PAGEANT.

168
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,067
>> OH, WOW.

169
00:04:41,067 --> 00:04:42,967
>> AND I COME HOME, AND THERE'S

170
00:04:42,967 --> 00:04:45,567
THE LETTER, AND, YOU KNOW, YOU

171
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:48,967
CAN'T HELP AS A MOTHER CRY FOR

172
00:04:48,967 --> 00:04:50,967
YOUR CHILD WHEN YOU KNOW THERE'S

173
00:04:50,967 --> 00:04:53,067
SO MUCH--SO MANY THINGS THAT SHE

174
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:55,233
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO.

175
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:56,533
SO WHAT YOU GOT TO TRY NOW IS TO

176
00:04:56,533 --> 00:04:59,200
REGEAR AND FOCUS ON WHAT CAN SHE

177
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,167
DO, HOW CAN SHE BE

178
00:05:01,167 --> 00:05:04,867
HER ULTIMATE BEST?

179
00:05:04,867 --> 00:05:06,400
>> COMING UP:

180
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,333
>> HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF

181
00:05:07,333 --> 00:05:10,200
A THING CALLED A MUCOUS PLUG?

182
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,233
>> EW.

183
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:12,233
>> OH, MY GOD, MOM, I HAVE

184
00:05:12,233 --> 00:05:14,167
BLOOD ON MY UNDERWEAR.

185
00:05:14,167 --> 00:05:15,667
>> YOUR CERVIX IS DILATED

186
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:17,633
TO ONE.

187
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:26,633
>> WELCOME BACK TO 16 AND 

188
00:05:26,633 --> 00:05:28,600

EVERYTHING WILL BE ALL RIGHT.

376
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,567
>> I KNOW; IT JUST SUCKS, 'CAUSE

377
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:08,867
ONCE I GET COMFORTABLE IN MY OWN

378
00:11:08,867 --> 00:11:13,067

00:11:16,933 --> 00:11:17,600
YOU'RE GONNA LOSE.

383
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,533
YOU'RE GONNA BE BACK TO NORMAL.

384
00:11:18,533 --> 00:11:19,267

00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,800
IT'S NOT FUNNY.

388
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,767
>> [laughs]

389
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:30,867

00:11:34,333 --> 00:11:35,067
TO BE SKINNY AND PREGNANT

392
00:11:35,067 --> 00:11:37,767

393
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,067

424
00:12:34,567 --> 00:12:35,767

425
00:12:35,767 --> 00:12:37,067

00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:49,133
>> NO, YOU DON'T.

436
00:12:49,133 --> 00:12:50,300
>> I DO KNOW ONE THING:

437
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,233
YOU BE CAREFUL.

438
00:12:51,233 --> 00:12:53,967
>> I PLAN TO BE, NOT LIKE YOU,

439
00:12:53,967 --> 00:12:55,100
WHO DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO DRIVE.

440
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,800
>> HURRY UP, AND BE CAREFUL.

441
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,500
[sighs]

442
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,800
>> BUT HERE'S THE FLIP SIDE:

443
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,600
PARENTS BEHAVING BADLY.

444
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,833
HERE'S THE BABY SHOWER YOU

445
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,533
DIDN'T SEE, AS EBONY, IN THE

00:13:07,533 --> 00:13:08,900
FINAL WEEKS OF HER PREGNANCY,

447
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,900
WAITS FOR HER MOTHER,

448
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:14,300
WHO PROMISED SHE'D BE THERE.

449
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:15,667
>> YOUR MOM'S COMING?

450
00:13:15,667 --> 00:13:16,667
>> MM-HMM.

451
00:13:16,667 --> 00:13:18,833
SHE'S JUST GONNA BE LATE.

452
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,167
I'M GONNA CALL MY MOM REAL QUICK

453
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:21,800
AND CHECK UP ON HER.

454
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:22,833
>> WHAT?

455
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:24,133
>> ARE YOU GONNA BE ABLE

456
00:13:24,133 --> 00:13:27,100
TO MAKE IT? YES, NO?

457
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:32,167
>> HUH?

458
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:33,400
YOU'RE ALMOST DONE, BUT YOU

459
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,300
DON'T THINK SO, MOM?

460
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,533
THE BABY SHOWER STARTED LATE

461
00:13:35,533 --> 00:13:36,700
ANYWAY, SO WE'RE JUST PLAYING

462
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:39,967

00:13:49,367 --> 00:13:50,067
[laughter]

469
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:50,867
>> THANK YOU FOR

470
00:13:50,867 --> 00:13:52,100
ALL THE DIAPERS.

471
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,067
[laughter]

472
00:13:59,733 --> 00:14:02,167
>> IT WENT GOOD.

473
00:14:02,167 --> 00:14:04,533
I'M GONNA BE BRINGING THE BABY

474
00:14:04,533 --> 00:14:06,067
GIFTS BACK OVER THERE LATER ON

475
00:14:06,067 --> 00:14:10,800
TONIGHT, SO...YOU KNOW.

476
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,733
>> IT'S OKAY.

477
00:14:18,767 --> 00:14:21,533
>> IT'S OKAY.

478
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:23,600
BYE.

479
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:28,467
[whispers] IT'S ALL RIGHT.

480
00:14:28,467 --> 00:14:30,500
>> SO IS YOUR MOM HOME NOW, HON?

481
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:31,267
>> YEAH.

482
00:14:31,267 --> 00:14:33,067
>> WHAT TIME DOES SHE GET OFF?

483
00:14:33,067 --> 00:14:35,433
>> 8-SOMETHING.

484
00:14:35,433 --> 00:14:36,500
THEN SHE HAD TO GO HOME

485
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,567
AND TAKE A SHOWER AND...

486
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:40,767
SO SHE COULDN'T MAKE IT.

487
00:14:40,767 --> 00:14:43,900
SO IT'S COOL.

488
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:46,567
>> IT'LL BE OKAY.

489
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:51,600

AT THE HOSPITAL.

493
00:14:55,167 --> 00:14:56,367
NOW, OBVIOUSLY TOUGH CALLS LIKE

494
00:14:56,367 --> 00:14:57,800
AN ADOPTION CAN HIT THE ENTIRE

495
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,600
FAMILY, AND IT'S ESPECIALLY

496
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,767
ROUGH GOING WHEN MOM AND

497
00:15:01,767 --> 00:15:04,333

HERE'S HOW THAT ONE PLAYED OUT.

499
00:15:10,233 --> 00:15:12,233
>> HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

AND GENTLE.

504
00:15:20,267 --> 00:15:21,067
>> WHY PUT HER NAME ON THERE

505
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:21,767
ALREADY?

506
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:23,233
SHE AIN'T ADOPTED YET.

507
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:24,067
>> NO, 'CAUSE WE HAD TO HAVE

508
00:15:24,067 --> 00:15:24,767
A NAME FOR HER BIRTH

509
00:15:24,767 --> 00:15:26,433

510
00:15:26,433 --> 00:15:28,533
>> I DON'T LIKE THAT NAME.

511
00:15:28,533 --> 00:15:31,067
>> NO, STOP.

512
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:33,867

513
00:15:33,867 --> 00:15:36,700
HEY, UM, NURSE, HI.

514
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:38,100
I'M DAWN; I'M THE SOCIAL WORKER.

515
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,100
HOW ARE YOU?

516
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,267
>> GOOD.

517
00:15:40,267 --> 00:15:41,900
>> I NEED TO KEEP APRIL HERE FOR

00:15:52,067 --> 00:15:52,700
WE NEED TO DO.

527
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,367
>> MY MOM'S JUST LIKE--

528
00:15:53,367 --> 00:15:54,200
SHE'S NOT SIGNING ANYTHING.

529
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,367
>> YOU NEED TO SIGN--

>> I'LL SEE YA.

532
00:16:00,667 --> 00:16:02,800
>> THAT'S WHAT I WAS AFRAID OF.

533
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:03,700
>> SHE WASN'T GONNA SIGN

534
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:06,433
ANYTHING FROM THE START.

535
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:08,500
>> OKAY.

536
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,567

00:16:09,567 --> 00:16:11,067
THE ADOPTION GOING, DIDN'T NEED

538
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:12,067
ME TO HELP PICK OUT THE PARENTS.

539
00:16:12,067 --> 00:16:12,733
YOU DON'T NEED ME

540
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:14,067

541
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:15,300

SHE'S NOT GONNA WITNESS

WHY DO YOU WANT TO INVOLVE ME

558
00:16:35,533 --> 00:16:36,667

559
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:38,067
SHE WAS 16 WHEN YOU STARTED

560
00:16:38,067 --> 00:16:39,200
TALKING TO HER.

561
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,267
>> IF YOU'RE NOT COMFORTABLE

562
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:41,333
SIGNING SOMETHING TODAY,

563
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,133
WE DON'T NEED TO.

564
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:43,600
>> NO, I'M NOT SIGNING ANYTHING.

565
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,833
>> OKAY.

566
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:47,200
[indistinct speech]

567
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,667
COULD WE SIT DOWN OVER HERE

568
00:16:48,667 --> 00:16:49,733
JUST FOR ONE MINUTE

569
00:16:49,733 --> 00:16:51,767
SO I CAN EXPLAIN TO YOU?

570
00:16:58,333 --> 00:16:59,900
OKAY.

571
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:02,067
UM, WELL, ESSENTIALLY,

572
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:03,167
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THE KIDS

573
00:17:03,167 --> 00:17:06,167
ARE GOING TO BE DOING TODAY.

574
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:08,733
IT WOULD BE--YOU KNOW, RIGHT

575
00:17:08,733 --> 00:17:09,800
NOW, THEY HAVE PHYSICAL CUSTODY

576
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,967
OF THE BABY.

577
00:17:10,967 --> 00:17:12,467
AND WHAT THEY WOULD BE DOING IS

578
00:17:12,467 --> 00:17:14,067
TRANSFERRING PHYSICAL CUSTODY

579
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:16,367
FROM THEM TO AN ADOPTIVE FAMILY.

580
00:17:16,367 --> 00:17:17,067
>> AS A GRANDPARENT,

581
00:17:17,067 --> 00:17:19,200
I HAVE NO RIGHTS.

582
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,367
>> YEAH, UNFORTUNATELY,

583
00:17:20,367 --> 00:17:22,700
IN MICHIGAN, THAT IS THE CASE.

584
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,467
UM, AND I KNOW THAT THAT SEEMS

585
00:17:25,467 --> 00:17:29,233
VERY HURTFUL, BUT WHAT YOU DO--

586
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:31,100
WHAT YOU DO HAVE A RIGHT TO IS

587
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,367
THAT CATELYNN HAS ALLOWED YOU

588
00:17:32,367 --> 00:17:35,500
TO HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT THE

589
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:37,233
ADOPTIVE FAMILY AND TO GET TO

590
00:17:37,233 --> 00:17:38,667
KNOW THEM AND MEET THEM AND TO

591
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:39,700
HAVE ONGOING COMMUNICATION

592
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:41,067
WITH THEM.

593
00:17:41,067 --> 00:17:42,333
I THINK THAT CATELYNN WOULD

594
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:43,500
REALLY, REALLY APPRECIATE

595
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,267
YOUR SUPPORT.

596
00:17:45,267 --> 00:17:46,167
CATELYNN.

597
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:47,167
>> WOULDN'T KNOW IT BY THE WAY

598
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,400
CATELYNN ACTS, SO...

599
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,567
>> HI.

600
00:17:49,567 --> 00:17:51,867
IT'S OKAY.

601
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:53,433
>> I WAS JUST TELLING YOUR MOM

602
00:17:53,433 --> 00:17:54,333
THAT I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT

603
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,400
APPRECIATE HER SUPPORT IN HER

604
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,067
JUST BEING THERE TO HEAR WHAT IT

605
00:17:58,067 --> 00:17:59,067
IS THAT YOU GUYS WERE SIGNING

606
00:17:59,067 --> 00:18:00,533
TODAY.

607
00:18:00,533 --> 00:18:01,600
HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT THAT?

608
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,500
>> LAST WEEK SHE WAS KEEPING

609
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,167
THE BABY.

610
00:18:03,167 --> 00:18:03,833
THIS WEEK SHE'S NOT.

611
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:04,500
SO YOU KNOW, HOW AM

612
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:06,500
I SUPPOSED TO FEEL?

613
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,267
>> SO IT'S--YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'VE

614
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:09,567
HAD SOME CONFLICTING MESSAGES.

615
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:10,433
>> YES, I HAVE.

616
00:18:10,433 --> 00:18:11,633
I HAVE A BASSINET; I HAVE

617
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:12,733
CLOTHES AT MY HOUSE BECAUSE SHE

618
00:18:12,733 --> 00:18:15,067
TOLD ME SHE WAS KEEPING HER.

619
00:18:15,067 --> 00:18:15,767
>> OKAY.

620
00:18:15,767 --> 00:18:16,600
>> AND I FEEL SHE'S GIVING HER

621
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,733
UP BECAUSE OF TYLER, AND THAT'S

622
00:18:17,733 --> 00:18:19,267
MY HONEST, TRUE FEELING.

623
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:20,233
>> BUT IT'S NOT.

624
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:22,133
>> WELL, THAT'S HOW I FEEL.

625
00:18:22,133 --> 00:18:25,700
I GOTTA GO.

626
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,933
I'M NOT SIGNING ANYTHING.

627
00:18:26,933 --> 00:18:28,900
>> OKAY.

628
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:32,100
>> UP NEXT, EVEN MORE REVEALING

629
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,067
UNSEEN MOMENTS FROM SEASON ONE

630
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:35,967
OF 16 AND PREGNANT. 

631
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:45,567
>> WELCOME BACK TO 16 AND 

632
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:47,833
 PREGNANT: UNSEEN MOMENTS. 

633
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,233
HERE NOW IS A TENSE MOMENT

634
00:18:49,233 --> 00:18:50,467
FROM AMBER'S STORY.

635
00:18:50,467 --> 00:18:51,500
YOU ALL REMEMBER GARY.

636
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:52,967
WELL, BEFORE HE RETURNED

637
00:18:52,967 --> 00:18:54,500
THE PRICEY VIDEOGAME CONSOLE

638
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,300
TO THE STORE, BEFORE THE PINK

639
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,067
SAPPHIRE ENGAGEMENT RING,

640
00:18:58,067 --> 00:18:59,533
GARY WAS IN FACT THE BOYFRIEND

641
00:18:59,533 --> 00:19:01,367
IN THE DOGHOUSE.

642
00:19:01,367 --> 00:19:02,633
THROUGHOUT SEASON ONE, THE GIRLS

643
00:19:02,633 --> 00:19:03,767
KEPT THEIR OWN VIDEO DIARIES

644
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:05,067
WHEN THE CAMERA CREWS COULDN'T

645
00:19:05,067 --> 00:19:06,067
BE WITH THEM, SO HERE NOW IS

646
00:19:06,067 --> 00:19:07,200
A LOOK AT AMBER AS SHE LET US IN

647
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,200
ON HER PRIVATE THOUGHTS

648
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:12,633
ON A RELATIONSHIP IN CRISIS.

649
00:19:12,633 --> 00:19:13,900
>> I MIGHT CALL MY MOM LATER ON,

650
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:14,667
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO LIVE

651
00:19:14,667 --> 00:19:16,567
HERE NO MORE.

652
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:17,467
YOU KNOW, I DON'T THINK

653
00:19:17,467 --> 00:19:18,500
HE UNDERSTANDS EXACTLY

654
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,100
WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH.

655
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,467
THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE OUT THERE

656
00:19:21,467 --> 00:19:22,933
WHO HAVE GOOD PREGNANCIES, YOU

657
00:19:22,933 --> 00:19:24,933
KNOW, AND THEY GET SICK A LITTLE

658
00:19:24,933 --> 00:19:27,067
BIT, AND THEN THEY STOP GETTING

659
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:28,167
SICK, AND THEN THEY GET SICK

660
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:29,333
A LITTLE BIT, YOU KNOW.

661
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,467
THAT'S HOW MOST PREGNANCIES ARE.

662
00:19:31,467 --> 00:19:32,900
AND THEN YOU GOT SOME WHO ARE

663
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,833
REALLY BAD.

664
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,967
THEY GET SICK EVERY DAY.

665
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,567
YOU KNOW, IT MAKES ME FEEL BAD,

666
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:39,600
YOU KNOW, LIKE I'M A BURDEN

667
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:40,733
TO HIM.

668
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:41,733
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR THREE

669
00:19:41,733 --> 00:19:45,200
YEARS, AND HE'S LOSING, LIKE,

670
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,300
DESIRE OR SOMETHING.

671
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,933
I NEED SOMEBODY THERE FOR ME,

672
00:19:49,933 --> 00:19:51,700
AND MY OLD MAN ISN'T EVEN THERE

673
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:55,433
FOR ME, SO...

674
00:19:58,567 --> 00:19:59,733
YOU KNOW, HE WAS JUST LIKE--

675
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:00,900
HE WAS, LIKE, A CHRISTIAN BOY.

676
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,900
THAT'S HOW HE WAS RAISED,

677
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,467
WHICH REALLY--THAT'S ONE THING

678
00:20:03,467 --> 00:20:04,667
THAT TURNED ME ON ABOUT HIM,

679
00:20:04,667 --> 00:20:06,967
'CAUSE JUST, LIKE, HE HAD

680
00:20:06,967 --> 00:20:08,000
MANNERS.

681
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,533
THAT WAS WHEN HE WAS SWEET.

682
00:20:09,533 --> 00:20:11,400
>> ROMANTIC.

683
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,233
>> I THINK MAYBE HE'S ACTING OUT

684
00:20:13,233 --> 00:20:15,333
RIGHT NOW BECAUSE HE MIGHT BE

685
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,633
SCARED HAVING THIS BABY, LIKE

686
00:20:17,633 --> 00:20:19,000
HIS LIFE IS RUINED OR SOMETHING

687
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,367
OR--I THINK IT MIGHT BE

688
00:20:20,367 --> 00:20:21,933
SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

689
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:22,833
>> SO AREN'T YOU GOING

690
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,233
TO GET MARRIED?

691
00:20:24,233 --> 00:20:25,200
>> I DON'T--WHY WOULD I GET

692
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,100
MARRIED WITH HIM ANY TIME SOON?

693
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,867
I DON'T EVEN KNOW IF I WANT

694
00:20:26,867 --> 00:20:27,833
TO BE WITH HIM FOR HOW HE'S

695
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:29,567
ACTING.

696
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:32,033
IF HE GOES BACK TO THE OLD GARY,

697
00:20:32,033 --> 00:20:33,767
WHICH I WANT, THEN I WILL

698
00:20:33,767 --> 00:20:35,900
MARRY HIM.

699
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:38,733
>> OF COURSE, FOR CATELYNN,

700
00:20:38,733 --> 00:20:39,767
THE STABLE RELATIONSHIP WAS

701
00:20:39,767 --> 00:20:41,167
THE EASY PART.

702
00:20:41,167 --> 00:20:42,300
SHE AND HER BOYFRIEND, TYLER,

703
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,767
WERE UP AGAINST EVERYTHING

704
00:20:43,767 --> 00:20:45,167
TOGETHER.

705
00:20:45,167 --> 00:20:46,200
ULTIMATELY THEY DID CHOOSE

706
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,133
ADOPTION, BUT MAKING THAT TOUGH

707
00:20:48,133 --> 00:20:49,233
CALL MEANT WRESTLING WITH

708
00:20:49,233 --> 00:20:50,933
CONSTANT DOUBTS.

709
00:20:50,933 --> 00:20:52,967
HERE CATELYNN TURNS FOR ADVICE

710
00:20:52,967 --> 00:20:55,067
TO TYLER'S SISTER, AMBER,

711
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:56,367
HERSELF A TEENAGE MOM

712
00:20:56,367 --> 00:20:58,667
WHO ONCE CONSIDERED ADOPTION.

713
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:06,733
>> WHEN I WAS GONNA GIVE

714
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:08,733
RIGHTEOUS UP, THE ADOPTIVE

715
00:21:08,733 --> 00:21:09,900
PARENTS WERE THERE WITH THEIR

716
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:11,267
OWN ROOM AND THE CAR SEAT

717
00:21:11,267 --> 00:21:12,133
AND TALKING ABOUT THE NURSERY

718
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:13,467
THEY GOT FOR HER; THEY JUST

719
00:21:13,467 --> 00:21:14,167
GOT DONE WITH IT.

720
00:21:14,167 --> 00:21:15,067
I WAS LIKE, "OH, SWEETIE,

721
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:16,267
SWEETIE," I MEAN, I DIDN'T HAVE

722
00:21:16,267 --> 00:21:17,300
NO PLAN "B" OR ANYTHING, AND

723
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:17,967
THEN MATT WAS JUST LIKE,

724
00:21:17,967 --> 00:21:18,900
"NO, JUST KEEP HER."

725
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,933
AND I WAS LIKE, "DUDE,

726
00:21:19,933 --> 00:21:20,933
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?"

727
00:21:20,933 --> 00:21:21,600
>> YEAH.

728
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,600
>> LIKE, I WAS--I WAS ACTUALLY

729
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:24,100
SCARED, EVEN THOUGH I KNEW HE

730
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,167
HAD A JOB AND HE'D BE ABLE TO

731
00:21:25,167 --> 00:21:26,467
TAKE CARE OF HER, BUT...

732
00:21:26,467 --> 00:21:27,600
>> SO HAVE YOU AND TYLER--

733
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,700
YOU GUYS ARE 100% SURE

734
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,133
ON THE ADOPTION?

735
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:31,300
>> YEAH, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF

736
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:33,500
TYLER TOLD YOU; DID HE?

737
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,367
TYLER, LIKE, FELL BACK ON IT

738
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:35,400
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

739
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,067
>> YEAH, HE TOLD ME

740
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:36,867
A LITTLE BIT.

741
00:21:36,867 --> 00:21:38,533
>> YEAH, THAT WAS BAD.

742
00:21:38,533 --> 00:21:39,733
>> WHAT DID YOU--WHAT--

743
00:21:39,733 --> 00:21:41,067
>> WHY WERE YOU MAD?

744
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:41,833
>> I WASN'T MAD;

745
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:42,900
I JUST WANTED TO KEEP HER.

746
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:43,867
>> WELL, YEAH.

747
00:21:43,867 --> 00:21:44,867
THAT'S ONLY NATURAL.

748
00:21:44,867 --> 00:21:45,700
>> FOR, LIKE, A COUPLE DAYS,

749
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:46,533
I WAS LIKE, "NOPE, I'M KEEPING

750
00:21:46,533 --> 00:21:47,500
HER; THAT'S IT."

751
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,200
I WAS LIKE, "NOPE.

752
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:48,867
THERE'S NO WAY.

753
00:21:48,867 --> 00:21:49,733
I'M NOT GOING BACK."

754
00:21:49,733 --> 00:21:50,967
>> DOES IT MAKE YOU WANT TO GIVE

755
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:51,867
HER UP SO YOU CAN BE WITH MY

756
00:21:51,867 --> 00:21:52,767
BROTHER OR...

757
00:21:52,767 --> 00:21:53,933
>> I MEAN, NO, I MEAN, I

758
00:21:53,933 --> 00:21:55,167
WOULDN'T WANT YOUR BROTHER TO

759
00:21:55,167 --> 00:21:56,333
LEAVE ME, BUT I MEAN, IF HE DID,

760
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,700
THEN THERE'S NOTHING I COULD DO

761
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:59,200
ABOUT IT ANYWAYS.

762
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,500
>> YEAH, I DON'T KNOW.

763
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,500
HE DOESN'T REALLY SAY TOO MUCH

764
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,500
ABOUT THAT.

765
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:03,733
>> YEAH.

766
00:22:03,733 --> 00:22:05,067
TO ME, HE'S JUST LIKE, "I THINK

767
00:22:05,067 --> 00:22:05,933
WE'D BREAK UP JUST BECAUSE

768
00:22:05,933 --> 00:22:06,933
OF ALL THE STRESS AND JUST

769
00:22:06,933 --> 00:22:08,067
LIKE"...

770
00:22:08,067 --> 00:22:08,667
>> I DON'T KNOW.

771
00:22:08,667 --> 00:22:09,333
>> DID HE EVER HAVE

772
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,333
SECOND THOUGHTS?

773
00:22:10,333 --> 00:22:11,500
>> YEAH, TYLER, HE DOES.

774
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,433
HE DOES A LOT, ACTUALLY, BUT

775
00:22:12,433 --> 00:22:15,067
HE JUST BRINGS HIMSELF BACK.

776
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:15,700
>> YES.

777
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:16,533
IT'S A LOT MORE THAN JUST

778
00:22:16,533 --> 00:22:18,500
KEEPING HER, YOU KNOW

779
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,467
WHAT I MEAN?

780
00:22:19,467 --> 00:22:20,600
IT'S JUST GONNA BE HARD.

781
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:21,333
>> I KNOW; IT'S GONNA BE

782
00:22:21,333 --> 00:22:22,667
REALLY HARD.

783
00:22:22,667 --> 00:22:23,600
>> BUT YOU DO WHAT YOUR HEART

784
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,400
TELLS YOU.

785
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,600
>> I KNOW.

786
00:22:35,433 --> 00:22:36,100
>> COMING UP...

787
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,067
>> I JUST FEEL REALLY DIZZY

788
00:22:37,067 --> 00:22:38,067
RIGHT NOW.

789
00:22:38,067 --> 00:22:41,067
OH, GOD, I CAN'T STAND IT.

790
00:22:41,067 --> 00:22:41,733
>> CAN YOU TAKE US

791
00:22:41,733 --> 00:22:42,733
TO THE DOCTOR?

792
00:22:42,733 --> 00:22:44,700
WINSTON'S SICK.

793
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:54,600
>> AND WELCOME BACK TO

794
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:55,533
 16 AND PREGNANT: 

795
00:22:55,533 --> 00:22:56,833
 THE UNSEEN MOMENTS. 

796
00:22:56,833 --> 00:22:58,067
I'M DR. DREW.

797
00:22:58,067 --> 00:22:59,067
NOW, THERE WAS A BIG HEALTH

798
00:22:59,067 --> 00:23:00,700
SCARE FOR AMBER, AND IT'S

799
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,667
SOMETHING THAT ALSO AFFECTS

800
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:03,533
135,000 AMERICAN MOMS

801
00:23:03,533 --> 00:23:04,900
EVERY YEAR.

802
00:23:04,900 --> 00:23:05,967
IT'S CALLED GESTATIONAL

803
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,433
DIABETES.

804
00:23:07,433 --> 00:23:08,633
BY MONTH SEVEN, AMBER WAS

805
00:23:08,633 --> 00:23:10,600
THROWING UP ALMOST EVERY DAY

806
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,167
BUT STILL EATING BADLY.

807
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,633
>> ON THE NUMBER FOUR, DO I GET

808
00:23:15,633 --> 00:23:16,933
TWO SIDES WITH THAT?

809
00:23:16,933 --> 00:23:18,467
LIKE, I WANTED COLE SLAW

810
00:23:18,467 --> 00:23:19,300
AND MASHED POTATOES AND GRAVY

811
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:21,767
WITH IT.

812
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:22,467
>> CAN I HELP YOU?

813
00:23:22,467 --> 00:23:24,200
>> YEAH, COULD WE GET A NACHO

814
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:26,267
CHEESE WITH MEAT AND TWO

815
00:23:26,267 --> 00:23:27,200
CHILI DOGS?

816
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:27,867
THAT'S IT.

817
00:23:27,867 --> 00:23:28,767
OH, WHAT DO YOU WANT TO DRINK?

818
00:23:28,767 --> 00:23:29,533
>> AND A GATORADE.

819
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:30,200
WHAT KIND OF GATORADE

820
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,300
DO YOU HAVE?

821
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:40,900
I'M JUST REALLY DIZZY

822
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:44,933
RIGHT NOW.

823
00:23:44,933 --> 00:23:46,767
>> TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.

824
00:23:46,767 --> 00:23:49,333
>> I DON'T KNOW; I'M JUST

825
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:54,533
PUKING AND...I DON'T KNOW.

826
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:55,867
I DON'T EVEN HAVE ANYTHING

827
00:23:55,867 --> 00:23:57,067
IN MY STOMACH, YET I FEEL LIKE

828
00:23:57,067 --> 00:23:59,200
I WAS STILL, LIKE, PUKING.

829
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,833
>> I THINK PROBABLY WHAT'S GONNA

830
00:24:00,833 --> 00:24:02,467
BE BEST IS TO JUST STAY AWAY

831
00:24:02,467 --> 00:24:03,767
FROM ANYTHING WITH SUGAR,

832
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:04,967
'CAUSE I SEE FROM YOUR CHART

833
00:24:04,967 --> 00:24:05,833
THAT IT SAYS THEY THINK YOU

834
00:24:05,833 --> 00:24:08,067
MIGHT HAVE GESTATIONAL DIABETES?

835
00:24:08,067 --> 00:24:09,933
>> MM-HMM.

836
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:13,200
[coughing]

837
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:16,233
[spitting]

838
00:24:22,733 --> 00:24:25,333
OH, GOD, I CAN'T STAND IT.

839
00:24:25,333 --> 00:24:26,267
>> DO YOU WANT TO GO AHEAD

840
00:24:26,267 --> 00:24:27,200
AND GET IN LINE SO WE CAN GET

841
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,200
YOUR BLOOD TEST, BABY?

842
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,200
WANT TO WAIT A SECOND?

843
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,933
YOU'RE OKAY, SWEETIE.

844
00:24:47,833 --> 00:24:48,867
>> JUST LAYING DOWN.

845
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:50,067
WHERE'S AMBER AT?

846
00:24:50,067 --> 00:24:51,067
>> WE'RE OVER AT COMMUNITY.

847
00:24:51,067 --> 00:24:52,867
WE'RE--WE'RE DOING A BLOOD TEST,

848
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:54,167
SO SHE'S LAYING DOWN RIGHT NOW,

849
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:55,067
WAITING FOR AN HOUR

850
00:24:55,067 --> 00:24:56,400
TO DO THE BLOOD TEST.

851
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,100
>> I HOPE I DON'T HAVE DIABETES

852
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,700
LIKE MY MOM DID.

853
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,467
>> YOU'RE FINE, BABE.

854
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:05,300
YOU'RE GONNA BE ALL RIGHT.

855
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,767
>> FEELING OKAY?

856
00:25:06,767 --> 00:25:07,767
>> YEAH.

857
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:08,867
I'VE BEEN ... ALL DAY.

858
00:25:08,867 --> 00:25:10,233
>> GOOD.

859
00:25:10,233 --> 00:25:12,367
>> AND YOU'RE FINISHED.

860
00:25:12,367 --> 00:25:14,233
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

861
00:25:14,233 --> 00:25:16,733
>> AMBER.

862
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,067
>> SHE'S CHECKING TO SEE IF

863
00:25:19,067 --> 00:25:22,500
YOUR BLOOD TESTS ARE IN.

864
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,900
>> OH, MAN, I DON'T WANT

865
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:25,467
TO HEAR IT.

866
00:25:25,467 --> 00:25:27,300
I'M NOT TAKING INSULIN.

867
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,633
>> WELL, IF THEY MAKE YOU TAKE

868
00:25:28,633 --> 00:25:29,633
INSULIN OR IF YOU HAVE TO,

869
00:25:29,633 --> 00:25:30,333
YOU HAVE TO TAKE IT.

870
00:25:30,333 --> 00:25:31,400
>> YOU KNOW I DON'T EAT BAD,

871
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,200
THOUGH.

872
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,400
>> IT DON'T MATTER.

873
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,500
YOU COULD EAT THE SMALLEST THING

874
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,300
THAT HAS SUGAR,

875
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,200
AND IT COULD REACT.

876
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:38,533
IT DON'T MATTER.

877
00:25:38,533 --> 00:25:39,533
>> HELLO.

878
00:25:39,533 --> 00:25:40,200
>> HI.

879
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,200
>> HOW ARE YOU?

880
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,633
YOUR GLUCOSE TEST WAS 148, OKAY?

881
00:25:44,633 --> 00:25:47,300
NOW, OUR CUTOFF IS 140.

882
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:52,400
>> ONCE AMBER FOUND OUT THAT

883
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,167
SHE DID HAVE DIABETES,

884
00:25:54,167 --> 00:25:55,067
TREATMENT NEEDED TO START

885
00:25:55,067 --> 00:25:55,967
IMMEDIATELY.

886
00:25:55,967 --> 00:25:57,433
THIS MEANT DITCHING HER BAD DIET

887
00:25:57,433 --> 00:25:59,067
AND TESTING HER BLOOD SUGAR

888
00:25:59,067 --> 00:26:00,800
FOUR TIMES A DAY.

889
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:05,567
>> ARE YOU SHOOTING UP AGAIN?

890
00:26:05,567 --> 00:26:08,267
>> 89; THAT'S GOOD.

891
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:09,067
>> THIS AIN'T THAT GOOD,

892
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,600
SO DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

893
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,900
>> SHUT UP; IT LOOKS GOOD.

894
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,867
I KNOW IT'S GOOD.

895
00:26:13,867 --> 00:26:14,900
CAN'T LIE TO ME.

896
00:26:14,900 --> 00:26:15,733
>> IT'S ACTUALLY DELICIOUS,

897
00:26:15,733 --> 00:26:16,767
BUT...

898
00:26:16,767 --> 00:26:17,533
>> I'M SURE THIS WILL BE GOOD

899
00:26:17,533 --> 00:26:19,800
TOO.

900
00:26:24,533 --> 00:26:28,833
WHAT WAS THAT?

901
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:31,167
WHAT IS THAT?

902
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,533
WHAT KIND OF LEAF WAS THAT?

903
00:26:34,533 --> 00:26:36,500
>> I DON'T KNOW.

904
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:41,400
WHY? WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT?

905
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,500
>> GUT HURT.

906
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,367
NOW I ATE ONE OF THESE THINGIES.

907
00:26:46,367 --> 00:26:47,933
>> TAKE THOSE OUT.

908
00:26:47,933 --> 00:26:49,167
>> IT MADE ME, LIKE--

909
00:26:49,167 --> 00:26:50,467
WHAT IS THAT?

910
00:26:50,467 --> 00:26:53,100
>> GRASS CLIPPINGS.

911
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,633
>> THAT WAS GROSS.

912
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,167
CAN YOU GO GET ONE MORE THING

913
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:00,667
OF RANCH?

914
00:27:00,667 --> 00:27:01,433
PLEASE?

915
00:27:01,433 --> 00:27:03,667
>> YEAH, TOTALLY.

916
00:27:03,667 --> 00:27:05,067
>> AS A PARENT, ALL YOU CAN

917
00:27:05,067 --> 00:27:06,600
HOPE FOR IS A HEALTHY BABY.

918
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,467
UNFORTUNATELY ONLY A FEW DAYS

919
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:09,633
AFTER RETURNING HOME FROM

920
00:27:09,633 --> 00:27:11,067
THE HOSPITAL, WHITNEY FOUND

921
00:27:11,067 --> 00:27:12,400
HERSELF IN A VERY SCARY

922
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,267
SITUATION WHEN BABY WESTON

923
00:27:14,267 --> 00:27:15,733
SUDDENLY COULDN'T KEEP

924
00:27:15,733 --> 00:27:17,700
ANY FOOD DOWN.

925
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:42,200
>> HELLO?

926
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:42,967
>> HI.

927
00:27:42,967 --> 00:27:43,767
>> HI.

928
00:27:43,767 --> 00:27:44,600
>> CAN YOU TAKE US

929
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:45,900
TO THE DOCTOR?

930
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:46,767
>> TO THE DOCTOR?

931
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:47,500
>> YEAH.

932
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:48,167
>> YEAH.

933
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,700
>> WE THINK WESTON'S SICK.

934
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,867
>> WHAT'S WRONG?

935
00:27:51,867 --> 00:27:53,200
>> HE'S LOSING WEIGHT,

936
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,200
AND HIS EYES ARE REAL DARK,

937
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,200
AND HE'S STILL SPITTING UP,

938
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:57,867
NOT TAKING--

939
00:27:57,867 --> 00:27:58,533
>> OH, HE IS?

940
00:27:58,533 --> 00:27:59,200
>> YEAH.

941
00:27:59,200 --> 00:27:59,867
>> DID YOU CALL

942
00:27:59,867 --> 00:28:00,767
THE DOCTOR'S OFFICE?

943
00:28:00,767 --> 00:28:01,600
>> I THINK WHITNEY'S ABOUT TO.

944
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,300
SHE'S GETTING THE NUMBER

945
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:03,133
RIGHT NOW.

946
00:28:03,133 --> 00:28:04,100
>> OKAY, CALL THEM, AND THEN

947
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,367
CALL ME BACK, OKAY?

948
00:28:05,367 --> 00:28:06,433
>> OKAY, JUST GET READY.

949
00:28:06,433 --> 00:28:07,700
>> OKAY, I WILL.

950
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,367
>> ALL RIGHT.

951
00:28:08,367 --> 00:28:11,400
THANK YOU. BYE.

952
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,267
SHE SAID CALL THE DOCTOR'S

953
00:28:12,267 --> 00:28:13,967
OFFICE, THEN CALL HER BACK.

954
00:28:13,967 --> 00:28:14,767
>> IF YOU'RE CALLING TO SPEAK

955
00:28:14,767 --> 00:28:15,500
WITH A NURSE, PLEASE...

956
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:18,233
[Whitney sniffles]

957
00:28:18,233 --> 00:28:19,500
UM, YES, MY LITTLE

958
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,667
THREE-WEEK-OLD SON, HE'S SICK,

959
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:23,767
AND HE'S THROWING UP, AND I WAS

960
00:28:23,767 --> 00:28:24,900
WONDERING IF I COULD BRING HIM

961
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,500
IN TODAY.

962
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,967
>> YOUR CALL WILL BE ANSWERED

963
00:28:27,967 --> 00:28:29,067
IN THE ORDER IN WHICH IT WAS

964
00:28:29,067 --> 00:28:30,233
RECEIVED.

965
00:28:30,233 --> 00:28:31,333
>> WHAT DOES IT SAY?

966
00:28:31,333 --> 00:28:32,133
>> I DON'T KNOW.

967
00:28:32,133 --> 00:28:33,967
IT'S JUST [bleep] STUPID.

968
00:28:33,967 --> 00:28:35,167
>> LET'S GET READY, AND IF

969
00:28:35,167 --> 00:28:36,900
ANYTHING ELSE, WE'LL JUST GO

970
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:38,733
UP THERE.

971
00:28:38,733 --> 00:28:40,367
AT LEAST IF WE GO UP THERE,

972
00:28:40,367 --> 00:28:41,067
WE CAN TALK TO SOMEBODY

973
00:28:41,067 --> 00:28:44,900
AND NOT A RECORDING.

974
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,267
>> BABY WESTON HAS SINCE BEEN

975
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:47,667
DIAGNOSED WITH ALPHA 1

976
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:49,167
ANTITRYPSIN DEFICIENCY.

977
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:50,067
NOW, THIS IS A LIFELONG

978
00:28:50,067 --> 00:28:51,633
GENETIC DISORDER.

979
00:28:51,633 --> 00:28:52,600
IT AFFECTS THE LIVER AND

980
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,067
THE LUNGS, BUT WHAT DOES IT

981
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:54,933
REALLY MEAN?

982
00:28:54,933 --> 00:28:56,067
WELL, IT MEANS BABY WESTON

983
00:28:56,067 --> 00:28:57,467
SHOULD NEVER BE AROUND CIGARETTE

984
00:28:57,467 --> 00:28:59,467
SMOKE, HE CAN NEVER DRINK EVEN A

985
00:28:59,467 --> 00:29:01,067
DROP OF ALCOHOL, AND HE CAN'T

986
00:29:01,067 --> 00:29:02,767
PLAY CONTACT SPORTS OR

987
00:29:02,767 --> 00:29:04,767
ROUGHHOUSE LIKE A TYPICAL KID.

988
00:29:04,767 --> 00:29:06,167
AND FOR PARENTS WESTON AND

989
00:29:06,167 --> 00:29:07,433
WHITNEY, IT'LL TAKE A WHOLE LOT

990
00:29:07,433 --> 00:29:09,400
OF INNER STRENGTH.

991
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:10,900
COMING UP...

992
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,900
>> WHERE ARE THE MATERNITY

993
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,100
COSTUMES?

994
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,833
OH, THAT'S DISGUSTING.

995
00:29:14,833 --> 00:29:16,067
>> I LOVE YOU.

996
00:29:16,067 --> 00:29:18,200
>> WHY ARE YOU BEING NICE?

997
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:27,533
>> HI, I'M DR. DREW.

998
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:29,500
WELCOME BACK TO 16 AND PREGNANT: 

999
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,167
 UNSEEN MOMENTS. 

1000
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:32,433
THROUGHOUT SEASON ONE, WE

1001
00:29:32,433 --> 00:29:34,200
WATCHED AS OUR TEEN MOMS

1002
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,300
STRUGGLED IN THEIR

1003
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:36,400
RELATIONSHIPS.

1004
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,600
AND WHILE THE DADS SOMETIMES

1005
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,200
MADE THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES

1006
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,133
CRAZY, THEY ALSO MADE THEM

1007
00:29:41,133 --> 00:29:42,100
LAUGH.

1008
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:43,400
TAKE A LOOK AT THIS SCENE WITH

1009
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:45,767
MACI, RYAN, AND THEIR FRIENDS.

1010
00:29:45,767 --> 00:29:46,967
>> WHAT ARE Y'ALL GONNA BE

1011
00:29:46,967 --> 00:29:48,500
FOR HALLOWEEN?

1012
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,567
>> WHAT ARE YOU GONNA BE?

1013
00:29:49,567 --> 00:29:51,067
>> A GANGSTER.

1014
00:29:51,067 --> 00:29:52,900
>> OH, MY GOD, LOOK.

1015
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:53,733
>> THERE'S A BABY?

1016
00:29:53,733 --> 00:29:55,400
>> THAT IS BENTLEY'S FRIEND.

1017
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,733
>> EWW.

1018
00:29:56,733 --> 00:29:57,967
THAT'S NOT RYAN.

1019
00:29:57,967 --> 00:30:01,133
>> HOW STUPID DO THESE LOOK?

1020
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,000
I WAS THE SLUTTY COP

1021
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,133
LAST YEAR.

1022
00:30:03,133 --> 00:30:04,267
WHERE ARE THE MATERNITY

1023
00:30:04,267 --> 00:30:05,900
COSTUMES?

1024
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:06,600
>> THEY GOT BIG TITTIES

1025
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,233
OVER THERE.

1026
00:30:08,233 --> 00:30:09,767
WELL, THEY DO.

1027
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:10,900
>> SHUT UP.

1028
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:13,300
>> COME HERE.

1029
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:14,500
HOLY [bleep].

1030
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,467
IS SHE GONNA PUT HER DAMN HEAD

1031
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:16,933
BACK ON?

1032
00:30:16,933 --> 00:30:17,600
>> RYAN, WHY'D YOU PICK

1033
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:18,267
THAT UP?

1034
00:30:18,267 --> 00:30:18,933
>> DO YOU WANT IT NOW?

1035
00:30:18,933 --> 00:30:20,867
>> YES, WE'RE TRYING IT ON.

1036
00:30:23,433 --> 00:30:25,200
[laughs]

1037
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,133
>> WHY DO THE PLUGS

1038
00:30:26,133 --> 00:30:27,000
LOOK LIKE THAT?

1039
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,767
>> I HAD A BIRTH DEFECT.

1040
00:30:28,767 --> 00:30:30,567
>> A BIRTH DEFECT.

1041
00:30:30,567 --> 00:30:32,000
>> EW, THAT'S DISGUSTING.

1042
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:33,667
>> NO.

1043
00:30:33,667 --> 00:30:34,367
>> GROSS.

1044
00:30:34,367 --> 00:30:36,600
>> GO GET ME SOME NYLON SOCKS.

1045
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,467
>> AS JOSH LEARNS, FATHERHOOD

1046
00:30:39,467 --> 00:30:41,800
DEMANDS PATIENCE, SELFLESSNESS,

1047
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,533
AND A TALENT FOR...

1048
00:30:43,533 --> 00:30:44,667
PRODUCT ASSEMBLY?

1049
00:30:44,667 --> 00:30:45,533
>> [grunts]

1050
00:30:45,533 --> 00:30:46,700
>> AND IT'S RIGHT--JOSH.

1051
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,533
>> WHAT?

1052
00:30:47,533 --> 00:30:48,200
>> SEE THE SIGN?

1053
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,267
IT'S RIGHT ON THE OTHER SIDE

1054
00:30:49,267 --> 00:30:51,067
OF THE SIGN.

1055
00:30:51,067 --> 00:30:52,200
I HOPE YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THIS,

1056
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,000
'CAUSE IT'S--

1057
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:53,700
>> I KNOW; I HOPE THERE'S

1058
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:54,533
INSTRUCTIONS, THOUGH.

1059
00:30:54,533 --> 00:30:55,867
>> CAN YOU FOLLOW THEM?

1060
00:30:55,867 --> 00:30:58,667
>> "LAP BELT." HOLD ON.

1061
00:30:58,667 --> 00:31:00,333
THIS GOES THIS WAY.

1062
00:31:00,333 --> 00:31:01,267
WELL, THEN, NOW I CAN'T SEE

1063
00:31:01,267 --> 00:31:02,467
THE INSTRUCTIONS.

1064
00:31:02,467 --> 00:31:03,667
[sighs]

1065
00:31:03,667 --> 00:31:04,567
WELL, THAT DOESN'T MAKE

1066
00:31:04,567 --> 00:31:05,667
ANY SENSE AT ALL.

1067
00:31:05,667 --> 00:31:07,233
>> OKAY, THEN MOVE.

1068
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:08,233
>> NOPE, DON'T MAKE NO SENSE

1069
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:09,233
TO ME AT ALL.

1070
00:31:09,233 --> 00:31:10,967
>> SERIOUSLY, JOSHUA?

1071
00:31:10,967 --> 00:31:12,900
>> SERIOUSLY, MOTHER.

1072
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:15,200
>> WHY INSERT--

1073
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,367
>> WELL, YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN

1074
00:31:17,367 --> 00:31:18,167
THAT ONE TO ME?

1075
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,367
>> [laughing]

1076
00:31:19,367 --> 00:31:20,367
NO, 'CAUSE THE BOTTOM PART'S

1077
00:31:20,367 --> 00:31:21,533
NOT OUT.

1078
00:31:21,533 --> 00:31:22,200
>> YEAH, SERIOUSLY,

1079
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:22,867
DO YOU GET IT?

1080
00:31:22,867 --> 00:31:23,667
>> SERIOUSLY, HOLD THIS.

1081
00:31:23,667 --> 00:31:25,700
THE BOTTOM BELT'S NOT OUT.

1082
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:26,633
>> "DO NOT USE AFTER

1083
00:31:26,633 --> 00:31:29,733
DECEMBER 2011."

1084
00:31:29,733 --> 00:31:33,067
>> OKAY, WELL, IT'S NOT 2011,

1085
00:31:33,067 --> 00:31:33,933
DADDY.

1086
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,067
>> WE GOT TO GET A NEW CAR SEAT

1087
00:31:35,067 --> 00:31:36,333
AFTER 2011?

1088
00:31:36,333 --> 00:31:37,500
>> YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO BUY

1089
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,800
A LOT OF THINGS AFTER--

1090
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:39,800
>> THAT'S RETARDED, THOUGH.

1091
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,533
I MEAN--

1092
00:31:40,533 --> 00:31:41,833
>> WHEN DOES SHE TURN 18?

1093
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:43,400
>> IN 18 YEARS.

1094
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,700
>> SO...

1095
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,567
UM...

1096
00:31:47,567 --> 00:31:48,700
GO THERE.

1097
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,667
THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE

1098
00:31:49,667 --> 00:31:53,200
SUPPOSED TO DO.

1099
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,067
[laughing]

1100
00:31:54,067 --> 00:31:55,600
>> THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

1101
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:56,367
THAT'S NOT GONNA WORK.

1102
00:31:56,367 --> 00:31:58,200
>> LET ME LOOK AT IT AGAIN.

1103
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:58,933
>> I THINK IT'S GOOD.

1104
00:31:58,933 --> 00:32:00,100
JUST DON'T GET IN A CAR WRECK,

1105
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,233
'CAUSE IF WE ROLL...

1106
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:04,300
>> JOSHUA, GET OUT OF THE WAY.

1107
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,733
DON'T YOU EVER PUT HER IN A CAR

1108
00:32:05,733 --> 00:32:06,633
WITHOUT A CAR SEAT.

1109
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:07,500
>> WELL, DUH.

1110
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:09,267
>> I'LL BEAT YOU.

1111
00:32:09,267 --> 00:32:10,267
YOU'LL BE GROUNDED FOR LIFE.

1112
00:32:10,267 --> 00:32:11,233
>> WHY WOULD I NOT PUT HER

1113
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:12,800
IN THE CAR WITH A CAR SEAT?

1114
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,567
>> JOSHUA, I DON'T KNOW.

1115
00:32:13,567 --> 00:32:14,867
YOU'RE 18, AND SOMETIMES THIS

1116
00:32:14,867 --> 00:32:16,467
NOGGIN DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK.

1117

00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:29,267
KIND OF HARD TO BELIEVE THAT

1179
00:34:29,267 --> 00:34:31,067
AFTER NINE MONTHS OF WAITING,

1180
00:34:31,067 --> 00:34:32,600
WORRYING, BREAK-UPS, AND

1181
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:34,700
BREAKDOWNS, OUR GIRLS, WELL,
