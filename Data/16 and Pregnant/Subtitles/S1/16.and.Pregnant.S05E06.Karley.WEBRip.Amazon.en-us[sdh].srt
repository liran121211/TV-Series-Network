1
00:00:04,133 --> 00:00:05,033
>> I WAS REALLY AWKWARD

2
00:00:05,033 --> 00:00:05,800
IN SIXTH GRADE.

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,167
[laughter]

4
00:00:07,167 --> 00:00:08,333
I'M KARLEY.

5
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:10,767
I'M 17 AND LIVE IN TOOELE, UTAH,

6
00:00:10,767 --> 00:00:12,400
RIGHT OUTSIDE OF SALT LAKE CITY.

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,133
I LIVE AT HOME WITH MY MOM,

8
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:16,300
DAD, YOUNGER SISTER,

9
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:18,667
BROTHER, AND OUR FOUR DOGS.

10
00:00:18,667 --> 00:00:19,867
THEY'RE EXCITED TO SEE US.

11
00:00:19,867 --> 00:00:21,167
I MET MY BOYFRIEND TONY

12
00:00:21,167 --> 00:00:22,900
IN HIGH SCHOOL TWO YEARS AGO,

13
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,200
AND I'M SINCE I'M A STRAIGHT "A"

14
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,500
STUDENT AND HE'S ALWAYS

15
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,733
STRUGGLED WITH HIS HOMEWORK,

16
00:00:26,733 --> 00:00:27,900
I DECIDED TO TUTOR HIM,

17
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:28,833
AND WE HIT IT OFF.

18
00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:29,500
LOVE YOU.

19
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,233
>> LOVE YOU TOO.

20
00:00:30,233 --> 00:00:31,167
>> BUT UNFORTUNATELY,

21
00:00:31,167 --> 00:00:32,467
TONY'S A LITTLE UNPREDICTABLE,

22
00:00:32,467 --> 00:00:33,567
AND HE ENDED UP DROPPING OUT

23
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:34,467
OF HIGH SCHOOL.

24
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:35,400
YOU'RE NOT GONNA HAVE ANY SKIN

25
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:36,033
LEFT.

26
00:00:36,033 --> 00:00:37,100
WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED?

27
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:38,867
>> SMOKE AND DEMON FACES.

28
00:00:38,867 --> 00:00:39,867
>> HM.

29
00:00:39,867 --> 00:00:41,133
AND EVERYTHING JUST BECAME

30
00:00:41,133 --> 00:00:42,533
TWICE AS COMPLICATED

31
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:44,567
BECAUSE I'M PREGNANT

32
00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:47,100
WITH TWINS.

33
00:00:57,467 --> 00:00:58,333
WHEN TONY AND I FOUND OUT

34
00:00:58,333 --> 00:00:59,767
WE WERE HAVING TWINS,

35
00:00:59,767 --> 00:01:00,733
WE DECIDED TO GET MARRIED

36
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:01,800
RIGHT AWAY SO WE COULD BE

37
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,067
A FAMILY.

38
00:01:03,067 --> 00:01:04,367
I SWITCHED TO HOMESCHOOLING

39
00:01:04,367 --> 00:01:05,500
SO I CAN STILL GRADUATE

40
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:06,267
THIS YEAR.

41
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:07,300
TONY FOUND FULL-TIME WORK

42
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:08,433
AS A MECHANIC AND MOVED

43
00:01:08,433 --> 00:01:09,333
INTO MY PARENTS' HOUSE

44
00:01:09,333 --> 00:01:10,433
TO BE WITH ME.

45
00:01:10,433 --> 00:01:11,833
BUT HE'S HAD A HARD TIME

46
00:01:11,833 --> 00:01:13,233
ADJUSTING TO LIVING IN SOMEONE

47
00:01:13,233 --> 00:01:14,333
ELSE'S HOUSE.

48
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:15,333
HE REALLY WANTS US TO GET

49
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:16,433
OUR OWN PLACE ONCE THE BABIES

50
00:01:16,433 --> 00:01:17,767
ARE HERE SO WE CAN RAISE OUR

51
00:01:17,767 --> 00:01:21,500
FAMILY IN OUR OWN HOME.

52
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:22,333
>> IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE

53
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:23,667
A LITTLE LOPSIDED, KARLEY.

54
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,133
>> I KNOW.

55
00:01:25,133 --> 00:01:26,167
>> I THINK THE BIG TWIN

56
00:01:26,167 --> 00:01:27,067
IS RIGHT THERE.

57
00:01:27,067 --> 00:01:28,067
>> THE BIG ONE IS GONNA

58
00:01:28,067 --> 00:01:28,700
BE AMARIAH.

59
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,367
AND THE OTHER ONE

60
00:01:29,367 --> 00:01:30,567
IS GONNA BE AMAYAH.

61
00:01:30,567 --> 00:01:31,900
>> I THINK TONY'S STILL HOPING

62
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,267
ONE OF THEM IS A BOY.

63
00:01:33,267 --> 00:01:34,533
>> YEP, I THINK SO.

64
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:36,133
>> OH, HE WON'T KNOW WHAT

65
00:01:36,133 --> 00:01:37,200
TO DO WITH TWO LITTLE GIRLS.

66
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,233
>> HE'LL GET USED TO IT.

67
00:01:38,233 --> 00:01:39,167
WHEN THEY COME OUT,

68
00:01:39,167 --> 00:01:40,067
HE'LL SEE.

69
00:01:40,067 --> 00:01:41,067
>> [laughs]

70
00:01:41,067 --> 00:01:41,967
>> [chortles]

71
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:44,067
>> I REMEMBER WHEN YOU TOLD ME,

72
00:01:44,067 --> 00:01:45,800
I WAS IN SHOCK.

73
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,900
I WASN'T UPSET WITH YOU.

74
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,233
JUST MORE JUST DISAPPOINTED,

75
00:01:51,233 --> 00:01:52,200
YOU KNOW?

76
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,600
WE WERE GETTING EXCITED ABOUT

77
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,733
PUTTING IN FOR SCHOLARSHIPS,

78
00:01:54,733 --> 00:01:56,867
AND YOUR GRADES ARE SO GOOD.

79
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,100
AND, YOU KNOW, I WANTED YOU

80
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,067
TO GO TO THE UNIVERSITY

81
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:02,067
OF UTAH.

82
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:02,800
[laughs]

83
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,167
>> EVERY TIME, LIKE, I GET MAIL

84
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:07,100
FROM COLLEGES, YOU ALWAYS,

85
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,067
LIKE, TEAR UP.

86
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:09,900
>> [laughs]

87
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:11,067
I CAN'T HELP IT.

88
00:02:11,067 --> 00:02:12,167
IT'S JUST A REMINDER OF WHAT

89
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:13,667
I WANTED YOU TO DO.

90
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:14,400
AND WHEN YOU FOUND OUT

91
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,900
THEY WERE TWINS, I JUST KNEW

92
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:16,767
HOW HARD IT WAS GONNA BE FOR

93
00:02:16,767 --> 00:02:17,667
YOU.

94
00:02:17,667 --> 00:02:19,700
>> YEAH.

95
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,867
>> SO WHAT'S YOUR BIGGEST WORRY?

96
00:02:21,867 --> 00:02:23,067
>> THAT I'M NOT GONNA BE

97
00:02:23,067 --> 00:02:26,767
GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEM.

98
00:02:26,767 --> 00:02:28,267
>> WELL, THE ODDS ARE AGAINST

99
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:29,633
YOU A LITTLE BIT.

100
00:02:29,633 --> 00:02:31,767
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE NOT

101
00:02:31,767 --> 00:02:34,267
OLD ENOUGH TO REALIZE WHAT

102
00:02:34,267 --> 00:02:36,400
A COMMITMENT IT IS.

103
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,733
I'M SO SCARED IT'S GONNA BE

104
00:02:37,733 --> 00:02:39,567
SO HARD FOR YOU.

105
00:02:39,567 --> 00:02:40,367
>> YEAH.

106
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:41,767
>> SO I LIKE HAVING YOU LIVE

107
00:02:41,767 --> 00:02:42,433
HERE.

108
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:43,800
>> DO YOU LIKE TONY LIVING HERE?

109
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,067
>> YOU KNOW, I DO.

110
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:47,333
BUT I KNOW THAT HE'S WORRIED

111
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:49,633
ABOUT NOT BEING ABLE

112
00:02:49,633 --> 00:02:53,433
TO BE A FATHER WHILE HE'S HERE,

113
00:02:53,433 --> 00:02:55,500
THAT I MIGHT MAYBE GET INVOLVED

114
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,733
TOO MUCH.

115
00:02:56,733 --> 00:02:58,667
SO I FEEL LIKE I'VE HAD

116
00:02:58,667 --> 00:02:59,567
TO REALLY HOLD MY TONGUE

117
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:00,400
AROUND HIM.

118
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,433
'CAUSE I REALLY DON'T WANT HIM

119
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:02,500
TO FEEL LIKE I'M INTRUDING.

120
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,433
>> YEAH.

121
00:03:03,433 --> 00:03:04,267
I DON'T THINK HE LIKES

122
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,100
THE ADVICE FROM ANYONE.

123
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:08,733
I DON'T KNOW WHY.

124
00:03:08,733 --> 00:03:09,767
>> YEAH.

125
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:10,767
BUT YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT

126
00:03:10,767 --> 00:03:11,933
TO GET IN THE WAY AND HAVE HIM

127
00:03:11,933 --> 00:03:13,200
RESENT ME.

128
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,067
SO...

129
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:17,267
>> YEAH.

130
00:03:22,767 --> 00:03:23,633
WITH SIX PEOPLE LIVING

131
00:03:23,633 --> 00:03:25,233
UNDER ONE ROOF, TONY HATES

132
00:03:25,233 --> 00:03:26,833
THAT HE NEVER HAS ANY PRIVACY

133
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,100
AND CAN'T DO WHAT HE WANTS

134
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,933
WHEN HE WANTS TO.

135
00:03:29,933 --> 00:03:31,333
SO WHEN HE'S HOME FROM WORK,

136
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,233
WE TRY AND GET OUT AS MUCH

137
00:03:32,233 --> 00:03:35,100
AS WE CAN.

138
00:03:38,533 --> 00:03:39,633
ARE YOU FREEZING?

139
00:03:39,633 --> 00:03:40,633
>> NO, IT FEELS REALLY GOOD

140
00:03:40,633 --> 00:03:41,300
OUT HERE.

141
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:42,133
>> ARE YOUR LEGS COLD?

142
00:03:42,133 --> 00:03:42,967
>> NO.

143
00:03:42,967 --> 00:03:43,767
>> [chortles]

144
00:03:43,767 --> 00:03:44,667
OH.

145
00:03:44,667 --> 00:03:45,567
>> SUCKS THAT I HAVE

146
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:47,533
TO GO TO WORK IN THIS, THOUGH.

147
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:48,533
>> YEAH.

148
00:03:48,533 --> 00:03:49,333
IT WAS PRETTY WEIRD WHEN WE

149
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:50,233
FOUND OUT WE WERE HAVING TWINS,

150
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:51,067
HUH?

151
00:03:51,067 --> 00:03:51,967
>> IT DID KIND OF SUCK

152
00:03:51,967 --> 00:03:53,267
'CAUSE I THOUGHT YOU WERE

153
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:54,333
LYING AT FIRST 'CAUSE WE

154
00:03:54,333 --> 00:03:56,500
WERE FIGHTING, AND...

155
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,533
I THOUGHT YOU WERE JUST SAYING

156
00:03:57,533 --> 00:03:58,433
IT SO THAT I WOULD STAY

157
00:03:58,433 --> 00:04:00,167
WITH YOU.

158
00:04:00,167 --> 00:04:01,300
AND THEN AFTER YOU SHOWED ME

159
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,067
THE TESTS, I KNEW THAT YOU

160
00:04:03,067 --> 00:04:05,067
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO RAISE

161
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:06,733
HIM ON YOUR OWN, SO...

162
00:04:06,733 --> 00:04:08,233
IN A WAY, IT'S BROUGHT OUT

163
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:09,267
A LOT OF GOOD.

164
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:10,100
>> YEAH.

165
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:13,067
>> WE GOT TO GET MARRIED FASTER.

166
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:14,400
IT'S MADE ME GROW UP MORE,

167
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,500
GET A JOB.

168
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,567
>> YEAH, BUT IT'S ALSO BEEN

169
00:04:16,567 --> 00:04:17,500
HARD.

170
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,767
LIKE, I WOULD NEVER SUGGEST IT

171
00:04:18,767 --> 00:04:20,600
TO ANYONE ELSE OR THINK

172
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,867
THIS IS HOW MY LIFE WAS GONNA

173
00:04:21,867 --> 00:04:23,133
TURN OUT.

174
00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:24,300
>> YEAH, IT'S WEIRD, 'CAUSE

175
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,800
WE'RE, LIKE, REALLY DIFFERENT.

176
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,267
I MEAN, YOU USED TO GO TO CHURCH

177
00:04:29,267 --> 00:04:30,067
AND...

178
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:31,067
>> [laughs]

179
00:04:31,067 --> 00:04:32,167
>> BELIEVED IN ALL THE GOOD

180
00:04:32,167 --> 00:04:33,133
THINGS, AND I DIDN'T

181
00:04:33,133 --> 00:04:33,833
AND BELIEVED IN ALL

182
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:34,633
THE BAD THINGS.

183
00:04:34,633 --> 00:04:36,767
>> I WAS GOOD STUDENT AND--

184
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:38,067
>> I NEVER WENT TO SCHOOL.

185
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:39,967
>> I DID YOUR HOMEWORK FOR YOU.

186
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:41,200
>> IT'S OKAY.

187
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,667
IT WORKS OUT GOOD.

188
00:04:42,667 --> 00:04:44,800
BUT IT'S GONNA BE MORE STRESSFUL

189
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,767
NOW THAT WE'RE HAVING TWO.

190
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:47,533
>> YEAH.

191
00:04:47,533 --> 00:04:48,567
DOUBLE THE DIAPERS.

192
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:49,667
DOUBLE THE WIPES.

193
00:04:49,667 --> 00:04:50,533
YOU'RE NEVER GONNA GET

194
00:04:50,533 --> 00:04:51,700
ANY SLEEP.

195
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,133
>> YEAH, I'M JUST GLAD

196
00:04:53,133 --> 00:04:55,900
THAT EVERYBODY IS HELPING US.

197
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,467
BUT THEN AGAIN, IF I START

198
00:04:57,467 --> 00:05:00,533
SAVING UP, WE CAN BE LIVING

199
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:01,933
SOMEWHERE NICE AND NOT

200
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:03,733
IN OUR PARENTS' HOUSE.

201
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:06,367
>> MAYBE.

202
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,567
SINCE I SWITCHED TO

203
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:22,967
HOMESCHOOLING, I BARELY GET

204
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:25,167
TO SEE MY FRIENDS ANYMORE.

205
00:05:25,167 --> 00:05:26,700
>> KARLEY!

206
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:27,733
>> I THINK BECCA'S HAVING...

207
00:05:27,733 --> 00:05:28,633
[laughing] A PROBLEM.

208
00:05:28,633 --> 00:05:29,500
>> BECCA.

209
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:30,467
CAN SHE NOT GET OUT?

210
00:05:30,467 --> 00:05:31,300
>> BRYTANNI, YOUR DAMN CAR.

211
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,133
[laughter]

212
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,633
>> WHOO, OKAY.

213
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:38,767
>> AH, IT'S SO NICE

214
00:05:38,767 --> 00:05:41,067
HANGING OUT WITH YOU AGAIN.

215
00:05:41,067 --> 00:05:41,767
>> I KNOW.

216
00:05:41,767 --> 00:05:43,067
I MISS GOING TO SCHOOL.

217
00:05:43,067 --> 00:05:44,600
>> REALLY?

218
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,600
WHY?

219
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,533
>> I GET SO BORED.

220
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:47,467
>> IT'S WEIRD THAT YOU'RE NOT

221
00:05:47,467 --> 00:05:48,200
THERE.

222
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,400
LIKE, I USUALLY HAVE SO MANY

223
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,333

224
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:51,667
>> I KNOW.

225
00:05:51,667 --> 00:05:52,500
>> WE SHOULD ALL GO ON A SENIOR

226
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,133
TRIP.

227
00:05:53,133 --> 00:05:54,067
THAT WOULD BE FUN.

228
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:54,867
>> I DON'T THINK SHE CAN

229
00:05:54,867 --> 00:05:55,833
LEAVE HER BABY THAT LONG.

230
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:56,700
>> THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

231
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,400
I WOULD LOVE TO.

232
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,100
>> NICE TRY, THOUGH.

233
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,133
>> BUT IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

234
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:01,300
>> YEAH.

>> WELL, I CAN WALK IF I WANT.

239
00:06:05,567 --> 00:06:06,300

242
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,667
>> YOU SHOULD WALK WITH US.

243
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:09,633
>> I'M GOING TO.

244
00:06:09,633 --> 00:06:10,767
>> ARE YOU STILL PLANNING

245
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:11,933

246
00:06:11,933 --> 00:06:13,867

TO BE A MOM?

260
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:27,533
>> I'M EXCITED NOT TO BE

261
00:06:27,533 --> 00:06:28,700
PREGNANT ANYMORE.

262
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,367
>> YEAH.

263

WE DIDN'T USE PROTECTION

281
00:06:49,167 --> 00:06:50,433
BEFORE MULTIPLE TIMES,

282
00:06:50,433 --> 00:06:51,833
SO NOTHING HAPPENED.

283
00:06:51,833 --> 00:06:52,600

00:06:55,233 --> 00:06:56,367
IT'S SO PRETTY.

287
00:06:56,367 --> 00:06:57,900
>> THANKS.

288
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:58,800
>> IS YOUR RELATIONSHIP, LIKE,

289
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,700
DIFFERENT SINCE YOU'VE BEEN

290
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,967
MARRIED OR IS IT JUST--

291
00:07:00,967 --> 00:07:02,433
>> YEAH, IT'S, LIKE, HARDER.

292
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:03,233

TO WORRY ABOUT STUFF,

295
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:05,600
AND WE JUST...

296
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,300
>> THAT'S TRUE.

297
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,433
>> FOCUSED ON HAVING FUN.

298
00:07:07,433 --> 00:07:08,433
AND NOW WE HAVE TO, LIKE, WORRY

299
00:07:08,433 --> 00:07:10,200
ABOUT RESPONSIBILITIES TOGETHER.

300
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,200
>> YEAH.

301
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,333
>> WAS HE OKAY WITH YOU GUYS

302
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,167

303
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:15,400
>> NO.

304
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,567
BUT HE WANTED TO BE WITH ME,

305
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:17,533
SO HE DID.

306
00:07:17,533 --> 00:07:18,467
>> both: THAT'S GOOD.

307
00:07:18,467 --> 00:07:19,167
>> YEAH.

308
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:20,467
BUT TONY WANTS TO GET OUT

309
00:07:20,467 --> 00:07:21,533
AS SOON AS WE CAN,

310
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:22,500
'CAUSE OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU THINK

311
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,200
OF HAVING KIDS, YOU HAVE

312
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:24,300
YOUR OWN PLACE AND EVERYTHING.

313
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:25,067
>> YEAH.

314
00:07:25,067 --> 00:07:26,067

00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:26,800
LIKE, HAVING TO LIVE

316
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,267
WITH MY PARENTS.

317
00:07:28,267 --> 00:07:29,533
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO, LIKE,

318
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,800
RAISE KIDS AT MY MOM'S HOUSE.

319
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
SO WE'LL SEE.

320
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,567
I DON'T KNOW.

321
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:34,833
BECAUSE TONY AND I ARE THINKING

322
00:07:34,833 --> 00:07:36,533
ABOUT MOVING OUT ONCE THE BABIES

323
00:07:36,533 --> 00:07:38,433
COME...

324
00:07:38,433 --> 00:07:39,767
MY MOM WANTS TO TALK IT ALL

325
00:07:39,767 --> 00:07:42,367
OVER.

326
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:45,100
>> OH.

327
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,933
[sighs]

328
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:46,900
HOW ARE YOU FEELING TODAY,

329
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,667
KARLEY?

330
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:48,800
>> EXHAUSTED.

331
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,100
>> I CAN TELL.

332
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,733
[chuckles]

333
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:51,467
SOUNDS LIKE YOU JUST RAN

334
00:07:51,467 --> 00:07:52,667
A MARATHON.

335
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:53,367
>> I KNOW; IT FEELS LIKE

336
00:07:53,367 --> 00:07:54,567
I JUST RAN A MARATHON.

337
00:07:54,567 --> 00:07:55,333
[laughs]

338
00:07:55,333 --> 00:07:56,800
>> I KNOW IT'S NOT IDEAL FOR YOU

339
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,800
TO BE HERE,

340
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,067
ESPECIALLY YOU, TONY.

341
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:00,067
I THINK IT'S HARDER FOR YOU

342
00:08:00,067 --> 00:08:00,867
TO BE HERE.

343
00:08:00,867 --> 00:08:02,133
LIKE, YOU'RE ALWAYS ASKING ME,

344
00:08:02,133 --> 00:08:03,367
"CAN I HAVE"--YOU'LL GO TO THE

345
00:08:03,367 --> 00:08:04,267
REFRIGERATOR AND SAY,

346
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:05,300
"CAN I HAVE THIS OR CAN

347
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:05,967
I HAVE THAT?"

348
00:08:05,967 --> 00:08:07,067
I'M LIKE, IT'S YOUR HOUSE.

349
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:08,633
I WANT YOU TO FEEL COMFORTABLE

350
00:08:08,633 --> 00:08:10,067
WHILE YOU'RE HERE.

351
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:11,633
AND YOU KNOW YOU GUYS ARE

352
00:08:11,633 --> 00:08:12,600
WELCOME TO STAY AS LONG AS IT

353
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,267
TAKES.

354
00:08:13,267 --> 00:08:14,067
>> MM-HMM.

355
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:15,467
>> BUT WE WANT TO BE OUT

356
00:08:15,467 --> 00:08:16,733
BEFORE THEY'RE AT LEAST SIX

357
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:18,933
MONTHS.

358
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:20,067
>> DO YOU THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE

359
00:08:20,067 --> 00:08:21,233
RIGHT NOW?

360
00:08:21,233 --> 00:08:22,400
>> I DON'T KNOW.

361
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,333
WE'RE GONNA SEE HOW THINGS GO.

362
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:25,500
>> YEAH.

363
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,600
TRUTH BE TOLD, I WOULD REALLY

364
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:28,167
LIKE TO SEE YOU GUYS STAY

365
00:08:28,167 --> 00:08:29,900
AT LEAST A YEAR BECAUSE I WANT

366
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,533
TO MAKE SURE YOU GUYS ARE OKAY,

367
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:33,200
YOU KNOW, THAT YOU CAN

368
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,800
FINANCIALLY HANDLE BEING ON--

369
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:35,567
>> BUT, I MEAN, LIKE,

370
00:08:35,567 --> 00:08:37,200
MY PLAN, FINANCIAL-WISE,

371
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,567
JUST, I'M NOT GONNA WORRY

372
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:39,233
ABOUT THAT STUFF,

373
00:08:39,233 --> 00:08:40,300
'CAUSE I'LL WORRY ABOUT THAT

374
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,867
WHEN THAT COMES.

375
00:08:41,867 --> 00:08:43,300
I'M JUST NOT A WORRIED PERSON.

376
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,400
LIKE, I DON'T REALLY--

377
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,800
>> I DO THE WORRYING FOR HIM.

378
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:46,600
>> I DON'T REALLY WORRY.

379

387
00:09:00,933 --> 00:09:03,267

00:09:05,067 --> 00:09:05,700

426
00:10:07,033 --> 00:10:08,233

00:10:08,233 --> 00:10:09,300
>> OKAY.

428
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,300
ALL RIGHT, SO FOR A TWO-BEDROOM

429
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,900
IN TOOELE, IT WOULD COST

430
00:10:12,900 --> 00:10:15,400
ANYWHERE FROM $600

431
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:18,133
TO ABOUT $800 A MONTH.

432
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:19,900
AND SOME OF THOSE, THEY ALSO

433
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,867
REQUIRED A SECURITY DEPOSIT.

434
00:10:21,867 --> 00:10:23,133
SO WHEN YOU MOVE INTO THE PLACE,

435
00:10:23,133 --> 00:10:25,100
YOU HAVE TO HAVE BOTH OF THAT.

436
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,667

>> RIGHT.

447
00:10:36,667 --> 00:10:40,033

452
00:10:46,433 --> 00:10:47,667
TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN IN THE

453
00:10:47,667 --> 00:10:48,900

454
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:49,767

457
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:55,733
IT'S SOMETHING TO STRIVE FOR.

458
00:10:55,733 --> 00:10:56,900
>> IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY

SO WHEN THE BABIES FIRST COME

569
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:12,933
HOME, ARE YOU GONNA TAKE OFF

570
00:14:12,933 --> 00:14:13,833
WORK?

571
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,100
>> YEAH, I'LL TAKE OFF AS MUCH

572
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,733
TIME AS I CAN.

573
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:18,067
>> YEAH, AND I KNOW MY MOM

574
00:14:18,067 --> 00:14:19,067
HAS TIME.

575
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,467
SHE'S GONNA TAKE OFF, TOO,

576
00:14:21,467 --> 00:14:22,233
WHICH WILL BE GOOD,

577
00:14:22,233 --> 00:14:23,067
ESPECIALLY IF I HAVE TO GET

578
00:14:23,067 --> 00:14:24,067
A C-SECTION, YOU KNOW?

579
00:14:24,067 --> 00:14:25,233
I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO BE

580
00:14:25,233 --> 00:14:26,300
GETTING UP A LOT AND DOING

581
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,967
EVERYTHING FOR THEM, SO...

582
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:29,067
>> IT WILL BE HARD

583
00:14:29,067 --> 00:14:31,100
FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF MONTHS.

584
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,667
>> YEAH.

585
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:34,200
BUT DO YOU THINK, WITH THE JOB

586
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,267
YOU HAVE NOW,

587
00:14:35,267 --> 00:14:36,533
THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE

588
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:38,867
ENOUGH MONEY FOR US TO MOVE OUT?

589
00:14:38,867 --> 00:14:40,367
>> I DON'T KNOW.

590
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:42,067
I MEAN, IF YOU HAVE A JOB,

591
00:14:42,067 --> 00:14:43,200
THEN, YEAH.

592
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,700
>> WELL, OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT GONNA

593
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,467
BE ABLE TO GET A JOB

594
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,700
RIGHT OFF THE BAT.

595
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,667
I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO LEAVE

596
00:14:48,667 --> 00:14:50,267
THEM WITH DAYCARE OR WHATEVER

597
00:14:50,267 --> 00:14:51,267
RIGHT OFF THE BAT.

598
00:14:51,267 --> 00:14:52,200
'CAUSE IF THEY'RE GONNA NEED

599
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,067
THEIR MOM, THEN,

600
00:14:53,067 --> 00:14:53,867
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

601
00:14:53,867 --> 00:14:55,267
>> YEAH, BUT THAT JUST MEANS

602
00:14:55,267 --> 00:14:57,233
IT'S, LIKE, A LONGER PROCESS

603
00:14:57,233 --> 00:14:58,567
OF US MOVING OUT.

604
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:01,067
>> I KNOW, BUT...

605
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:01,867
I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT

606
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,133
TO SAY TO YOU.

607
00:15:03,133 --> 00:15:03,933
>> WELL, THAT KIND OF REALLY

608
00:15:03,933 --> 00:15:05,267
PISSES ME OFF.

609
00:15:05,267 --> 00:15:06,200
I GUESS I JUST WANT TO BE

610
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,733
OUT OF HERE FAST, 'CAUSE I WANT

611
00:15:07,733 --> 00:15:09,500
TO--I DON'T WANT TO RAISE

612
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
MY KIDS AROUND YOUR PARENTS.

613
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,300
I WANT TO RAISE MY KIDS

614
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:13,367
ON MY OWN.

615
00:15:13,367 --> 00:15:14,200
>> I KNOW, BUT--

616
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,867
>> AND I'M NOT COMFORTABLE HERE.

617
00:15:15,867 --> 00:15:17,533
AND I DON'T EVEN WANT TO BE HERE

618
00:15:17,533 --> 00:15:19,200
RIGHT NOW, BUT I AM.

619
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:20,933
>> YEAH, WELL, I AM SORRY

620
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:22,267
THAT YOU FEEL THAT WAY.

621
00:15:22,267 --> 00:15:25,367
I WANT TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT,

622
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:26,233
TOO, BUT--

623
00:15:26,233 --> 00:15:27,400
>> THEN YOU HAVE TO WORK

624
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,600
IN ORDER TO DO THAT.

625
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,167
>> YEAH, WELL,

626
00:15:31,167 --> 00:15:32,167
WHEN THE GIRLS COME,

627
00:15:32,167 --> 00:15:34,200
WE CAN SEE HOW THINGS GO,

628
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,300
AND THEN WE'LL SEE.

629
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,800
BUT LOOK AT IT THIS WAY.

630
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,433
IF I GET A JOB RIGHT AWAY,

631
00:15:39,433 --> 00:15:40,300
THEY'RE GONNA BE RAISING OUR

632
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,533
KIDS.

633
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:43,267
EVERYONE IS.

634
00:15:43,267 --> 00:15:44,967
YOUR GRANDPARENTS, YOUR MOM,

635
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:46,100
MY MOM.

636
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:46,967
LIKE, AT LEAST HERE,

637
00:15:46,967 --> 00:15:47,900
THEY WOULD HAVE MORE GUIDANCE

638
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,067
FROM US.

639
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:50,467
SO I DON'T THINK YOU REALIZE

640
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:51,767
THAT.

641
00:15:51,767 --> 00:15:53,067
>> AND I DON'T THINK YOU REALIZE

642
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:55,933
HOW UNHAPPY I AM HERE.

643
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,300
>> WE HAD TO SET ASIDE OUR

644
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,700
DISCUSSION ABOUT MOVING OUT

645
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:16,967
BECAUSE I WOKE UP IN THE MIDDLE

646
00:16:16,967 --> 00:16:18,967
OF THE NIGHT WITH HORRIBLE PAIN.

647
00:16:18,967 --> 00:16:21,133
TONY RUSHED ME TO THE HOSPITAL.

648
00:16:21,133 --> 00:16:22,167
WHEN I GOT THERE,

649
00:16:22,167 --> 00:16:23,267
THE DOCTOR SAID I WAS GOING

650
00:16:23,267 --> 00:16:24,467
INTO LABOR AND THAT ONE

651
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:25,633
OF THE BABIES WAS SITTING

652
00:16:25,633 --> 00:16:26,800
BREACH AND CAUSING THE PAIN

653
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:29,133
DOWN MY BACK.

654
00:16:29,133 --> 00:16:30,300
IT'S BEEN THREE HOURS,

655
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,333
AND THE BABY STILL ISN'T

656
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:32,567
TURNING, AND THE PAIN KEEPS

657
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:34,400
GETTING WORSE.

658
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:37,800
MY BACK HURTS SO BAD.

659
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,100
>> WANT ME TO RUB IT?

660
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:39,833
>> NO.

661
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:40,633
>> NO, DON'T TOUCH IT?

662
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:41,400
>> NO.

663
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:43,633
>> OKAY.

664
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:47,100
>> I'M SCARED NOW.

665
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:47,800
>> YOU KNOW WHAT?

666
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,833
ONCE YOU HAVE THAT EPIDURAL,

667
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:51,133
YOU'LL BE PERFECT.

668
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:53,667
>> DOES EPIDURAL HURT?

669
00:16:53,667 --> 00:16:54,833
>> I'M NOT GONNA LIE TO YOU.

670
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:57,300
IT'S A LITTLE UNCOMFORTABLE.

671
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:59,267
BUT ONCE THE EPIDURAL GOES IN,

672
00:16:59,267 --> 00:17:01,067
YOU WON'T BE CARING ABOUT

673
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:01,733
NOTHING.

674
00:17:01,733 --> 00:17:02,400
>> [chortles]

BUT, LIKE, YOUR BODY.

677
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,400
YOUR BACK PAIN WILL IMMEDIATELY

678
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,067
GO AWAY, SWEETIE.

679
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,133
>> SOUNDS SO GOOD.

680
00:17:07,133 --> 00:17:09,300
>> OKAY?

681
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:12,200
>> A COUPLE HOURS LATER,

682
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,467
THE BABY STILL WASN'T TURNED,

683
00:17:13,467 --> 00:17:14,600
SO THE DOCTOR DECIDED TO DO

684
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,933
A C-SECTION.

MY SURGERY, BUT SINCE THE BABIES

709
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:20,800
WERE BORN A COUPLE WEEKS EARLY,

710
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,067
THEY NEED TO SPEND SOME TIME

711
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,267
IN THE NICU SO THEY CAN GET

712
00:18:23,267 --> 00:18:24,600
A LITTLE BIGGER BEFORE WE TAKE

713
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,367
THEM HOME.

714
00:18:25,367 --> 00:18:26,533
IT'S WEIRD TO THINK THAT THESE

715
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:28,833
GUYS WERE JUST INSIDE OF ME.

716
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:29,667

AND I ASKED MY MOM TO BABYSIT

944
00:25:37,133 --> 00:25:38,133
'CAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN MY FRIENDS

945
00:25:38,133 --> 00:25:39,300
SINCE BEFORE THE BABIES WERE

946
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:42,200
BORN.

947
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,200
I STILL DON'T REMEMBER WHOSE

948
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,333
DRINK IS WHOSE, BUT--

949
00:25:44,333 --> 00:25:45,467
>> I CAN.

950
00:25:45,467 --> 00:25:47,900
>> HOW DO YOU KNOW?

951
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,133
>> OH, YOU WERE RIGHT.

952
00:25:49,133 --> 00:25:50,867
THAT IS MINE.

953
00:25:50,867 --> 00:25:52,067
>> YEAH.

954
00:25:52,067 --> 00:25:52,800
SO HAS IT BEEN TIRING

955
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,300
TAKING CARE OF TWO BABIES?

956
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,333
>> YEAH, IT'S HARD.

957
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:56,267
IT'S A LOT HARDER THAN I THOUGHT

958
00:25:56,267 --> 00:25:57,100
IT WOULD BE.

959
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,833
LIKE, IT'S FUN.

960
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:00,067
WELL, IT'S NOT ALWAYS FUN.

961
00:26:00,067 --> 00:26:02,333
BUT IT'S REWARDING,

962
00:26:02,333 --> 00:26:04,100
BUT IT KIND OF SUCKS TOO.

963
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,233
>> THAT SUCKS.

964
00:26:05,233 --> 00:26:07,367
>> SO HOW ARE THINGS WITH TONY?

965
00:26:07,367 --> 00:26:08,400
>> WELL, HE'S WANTING TO GET

966
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,267
A TRUCK, AND HE'S, LIKE,

967
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:10,200
REALLY INTO IT,

968
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,067
AND IT'S KIND OF ANNOYING

969
00:26:11,067 --> 00:26:11,833
'CAUSE I DON'T WANT HIM

970
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:12,500
TO GET ONE.

971
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,333
>> THAT DOES NOT SOUND

972
00:26:13,333 --> 00:26:15,933
PRACTICAL.

973
00:26:18,933 --> 00:26:20,300
>> SO HOW WOULD YOU FEEL

974
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:22,500
IF SHE SPENT 850 BUCKS

975
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,367
ON SOMETHING THAT YOU DIDN'T

976
00:26:23,367 --> 00:26:24,433
WANT HER TO GET?

977
00:26:24,433 --> 00:26:25,600
>> I DON'T KNOW.

978
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,600
I MEAN, I WOULDN'T LIKE IT.

979
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:28,767
>> SO WHY DO YOU WANT TO GET

980
00:26:28,767 --> 00:26:29,933
A TRUCK?

981
00:26:29,933 --> 00:26:32,900
>> SO I CAN HAVE FUN, LIKE...

982
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,600
I DON'T KNOW.

983
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,533
WHEN IT STARTS TO SNOW MORE

984
00:26:35,533 --> 00:26:36,900
AND RAINS A LOT MORE,

985
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:38,133
I COULD GO OUT,

986
00:26:38,133 --> 00:26:39,067
GO MUDDING.

987
00:26:39,067 --> 00:26:40,833
>> [chuckles]

988
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:43,400
>> MAKES SENSE TO ME.

989
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,633
>> CAN YOU GUYS AFFORD

990
00:26:44,633 --> 00:26:45,633
A TRUCK RIGHT NOW?

991
00:26:45,633 --> 00:26:46,467
>> NO.

992
00:26:46,467 --> 00:26:47,767
AND IT'S NOT LIKE A FAMILY CAR

993
00:26:47,767 --> 00:26:48,533
AT ALL.

994
00:26:48,533 --> 00:26:49,933
LIKE, IT'S SOMETHING FOR HIM.

995
00:26:49,933 --> 00:26:51,100
>> AND SINCE YOU'RE MARRIED,

996
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:52,600
THEN IT'S A PARTNER THING.

997
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:53,433
>> MM-HMM.

998
00:26:53,433 --> 00:26:54,100
WHAT HE DOES,

999
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,067
IT DOESN'T JUST AFFECT ME.

1000
00:26:55,067 --> 00:26:55,867
IT AFFECTS, LIKE, THREE OF US,

1001
00:26:55,867 --> 00:26:56,533
YOU KNOW?

1002
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:57,400
>> YEAH.

1003
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,500
>> AND IT ALSO AFFECTS, LIKE,

1004
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,600
EVERYONE ELSE, 'CAUSE IF WE

1005
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:01,167
DON'T HAVE MONEY TO BUY STUFF,

1006
00:27:01,167 --> 00:27:02,200
I HAVE TO ASK MY MOM

1007
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,133
OR HE HAS TO ASK HIS MOM,

1008
00:27:03,133 --> 00:27:04,567
SO IT AFFECTS A LOT MORE PEOPLE

1009
00:27:04,567 --> 00:27:07,500
THAN JUST HIM.

1010
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,800
>> IT'S ONLY A THREE-SEATER,

1011
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,967
BUT, I MEAN, I'M ALWAYS DOING

1012
00:27:09,967 --> 00:27:12,500
EVERYTHING FOR EVERYBODY ELSE,

1013
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,167
SO THIS TRUCK'S MORE FOR ME

1014
00:27:14,167 --> 00:27:15,900
THAN ANYONE ELSE.

1015
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,200
>> DON'T TELL KARLEY THAT.

1016
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,733
>> YEAH, EXACTLY.

1017
00:27:18,733 --> 00:27:19,567
>> IF YOU'RE TRYING TO GET

1018
00:27:19,567 --> 00:27:20,500
AN APARTMENT, SAVING UP

1019
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:23,467
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN A BAD IDEA.

1020

>> IF YOU COULD DO ANY ONE THING

1021
00:27:25,267 --> 00:27:26,967
FOR YOURSELF, WOULD YOU BUY

1022
00:27:26,967 --> 00:27:28,067
YOURSELF A TRUCK?

1023
00:27:28,067 --> 00:27:29,800
>> [chuckling] NO.

1024
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,533

1028
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:34,933
A PRIORITY ANYMORE.

1029
00:27:34,933 --> 00:27:35,633
>> YEAH.

1030
00:27:35,633 --> 00:27:36,800
>> LIKE, YOURSELF IN GENERAL

1031
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,300
IS NOT A PRIORITY?

1032
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,433
>> YEAH, LIKE, DOING THE BASICS,

1033
00:27:39,433 --> 00:27:40,367
LIKE, TAKING CARE OF MYSELF,

1034
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,600
LIKE, EATING AND SHOWERING

1035
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:42,267

THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT.

1038
00:27:43,767 --> 00:27:44,400
BEING A MOM, THOUGH.

1039
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,333
I THINK ONCE YOU HAVE YOUR KIDS,

1040

YOU'RE MORE FOCUSED ON MAKING

1041
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,967
THEM HAPPY RATHER THAN YOURSELF.

00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,633
>> TONY, YOU HAVE UP UNTIL NOW.

1128
00:30:38,633 --> 00:30:39,967
>> [sighs]

1129
00:30:39,967 --> 00:30:40,933
QUIT YELLING.

1130
00:30:40,933 --> 00:30:42,767
[sniffs]

1131
00:30:42,767 --> 00:30:43,833
'CAUSE THAT'S GONNA PISS ME OFF

1132
00:30:43,833 --> 00:30:44,800
REAL QUICK.

1133
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:45,567
>> I DON'T CARE, TONY.

1134
00:30:45,567 --> 00:30:46,200
I'M NOT GONNA--

1135
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:46,967
>> I [bleep] CARE!

1136
00:30:46,967 --> 00:30:47,733
>> I'M NOT GONNA TIPTOE

1137
00:30:47,733 --> 00:30:49,900
AROUND YOU.

1138
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:52,100
>> I'M DONE TALKING ABOUT IT.

1139
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:52,800
[sniffs]

1140
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,267
YOU'RE ALREADY STARTING TO YELL.

1141
00:30:54,267 --> 00:30:55,200
>> IT'S BECAUSE IT'S ANNOYING

1142
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:56,333
TO REALIZE THAT YOU DON'T EVEN

1143
00:30:56,333 --> 00:30:57,367
CARE.

1144
00:30:57,367 --> 00:30:58,233
IT'S REALLY FRUSTRATING

1145
00:30:58,233 --> 00:31:00,767
TO REALIZE THAT YOU DISRESPECTED

1146
00:31:00,767 --> 00:31:01,767
THE PERSON WHO TAKES CARE

1147
00:31:01,767 --> 00:31:02,933
OF YOUR CHILDREN,

1148
00:31:02,933 --> 00:31:03,733
WHO HAD TO GIVE UP EVERYTHING

1149
00:31:03,733 --> 00:31:04,467
FOR THESE CHILDREN.

1150
00:31:04,467 --> 00:31:05,167
YOU DON'T EVEN CARE.

1151
00:31:05,167 --> 00:31:06,133
>> SO WHAT CAN YOU DEPEND ON ME

1152
00:31:06,133 --> 00:31:07,533
FOR, NOTHING?

1153
00:31:07,533 --> 00:31:08,333
THEN WHY THE [bleep]

1154
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:09,267
AM I STILL HERE?

1155
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:10,067
WHY THE [bleep] AM I STILL

1156
00:31:10,067 --> 00:31:10,867
WORKING?

1157
00:31:10,867 --> 00:31:14,467
WHY ARE WE STILL MARRIED?

1158
00:31:14,467 --> 00:31:16,233
TELL ME, WHY AM I STILL HERE?

1159
00:31:16,233 --> 00:31:17,667
IF I'M NOT GONNA CARE ABOUT YOU,

1160
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:18,533
WHY AM I STILL HERE?

1161
00:31:18,533 --> 00:31:19,500
>> I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU DON'T

1162
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:20,367
CARE ABOUT ME, HONESTLY.

1163
00:31:20,367 --> 00:31:21,133
>> RIGHT, I DON'T GIVE A

1164
00:31:21,133 --> 00:31:21,700
[bleep].

1165
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,367
END OF STORY.

1166
00:31:22,367 --> 00:31:23,100
[sniffs]

1167
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,067
>> IT'S NOT FAIR TO ME, TONY.

1168
00:31:24,067 --> 00:31:26,367
>> I'M [bleep] LEAVING.

1169
00:31:26,367 --> 00:31:30,067
HERE, TAKE AMARIAH.

1170
00:31:31,633 --> 00:31:32,867
>> LEAVE YOUR CARD ON THE TABLE.

1171
00:31:32,867 --> 00:31:34,433
THEY NEED FOOD.

1172
00:31:34,433 --> 00:31:37,900
>> KISS MY ASS.

1173
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,133
[door slams]

1174
00:31:43,233 --> 00:31:46,400
>> * DO YOU REMEMBER

1175
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:48,667
>> [sobbing]

1176
00:32:09,167 --> 00:32:10,467
>> I HAVEN'T SPOKEN TO TONY

1177
00:32:10,467 --> 00:32:11,967
SINCE HE LEFT AND SPENT LAST

1178
00:32:11,967 --> 00:32:13,867
NIGHT AT HIS MOM'S HOUSE.

1179
00:32:13,867 --> 00:32:15,667
>> I REALLY JUST WISH THAT

1180
00:32:15,667 --> 00:32:16,867
TONY WOULD HAVE THOUGHT ABOUT

1181
00:32:16,867 --> 00:32:18,067
THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT

1182
00:32:18,067 --> 00:32:19,367
IT WAS GONNA DO TO YOUR FAMILY

1183
00:32:19,367 --> 00:32:21,133
WHEN HE BOUGHT THAT TRUCK.

1184
00:32:21,133 --> 00:32:21,933
YOU KNOW?

1185
00:32:21,933 --> 00:32:23,067
>> I KNOW.

1186
00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:24,233
>> I DON'T THINK A LOT OF

1187
00:32:24,233 --> 00:32:26,300
TEENAGERS THINK THAT WAY.

1188
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,267
I THINK THEY JUST THINK

1189
00:32:27,267 --> 00:32:28,400
ABOUT THEMSELVES AND WHAT

1190
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:29,667
FEELS GOOD TO THEM

1191
00:32:29,667 --> 00:32:31,233
AT THE TIME.

1192
00:32:31,233 --> 00:32:32,767
>> YEAH, THAT'S--THAT'S TRUE.

1193
00:32:32,767 --> 00:32:33,600
>> YEAH.

1194
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:34,400
>> I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE

1195
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,133
TO MOVE OUT FOR A LONG TIME.

1196
00:32:37,133 --> 00:32:38,067
>> YEAH.

1197
00:32:38,067 --> 00:32:39,767
I TRY NOT TO LET YOUR FIGHTS

1198
00:32:39,767 --> 00:32:41,433
BOTHER ME, BUT THEY DO.

1199
00:32:41,433 --> 00:32:43,333
I CAN'T HELP IT.

1200
00:32:43,333 --> 00:32:45,367
>> YEAH, THAT'S UNDERSTANDABLE.

1201
00:32:45,367 --> 00:32:46,500
BUT THEY GOT TO LEARN

1202
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,233
ON THEIR OWN.

1203
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:49,333
YOU KNOW?

1204
00:32:49,333 --> 00:32:50,700
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1205
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,800
MAKES ME FEEL GUILTY 'CAUSE

1206
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:52,867
I FEEL LIKE SUCH A BURDEN.

1207
00:32:52,867 --> 00:32:54,900
AND MAKES ME FEEL BAD.

1208
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,533
>> I GUESS, JUST THINKING AHEAD,

1209
00:32:56,533 --> 00:32:57,800
THAT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND

1210
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,333
WHY I'M FRUSTRATED,

1211
00:33:00,333 --> 00:33:01,633
'CAUSE HE REALLY HASN'T HAD

1212
00:33:01,633 --> 00:33:03,100
TO SPEND ANY OF HIS PAYCHECK

1213
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,467
TOWARD THESE GUYS.

1214
00:33:05,467 --> 00:33:07,467
AND DAD AND I HAD DIFFERENT

1215
00:33:07,467 --> 00:33:08,933
PLANS FOR THIS STAGE OF OUR

1216
00:33:08,933 --> 00:33:11,067
LIFE, AND IT DIDN'T INCLUDE

1217
00:33:11,067 --> 00:33:12,867
HELPING TEENAGERS RAISE

1218
00:33:12,867 --> 00:33:15,067
THEIR BABIES.

1219
00:33:15,067 --> 00:33:16,933
NOT THAT WE WON'T HELP YOU,

1220
00:33:16,933 --> 00:33:18,567
AND WE'RE GLAD TO DO IT.

1221
00:33:18,567 --> 00:33:19,567
IT'S JUST, IT WASN'T WHAT I

1222
00:33:19,567 --> 00:33:21,133
ENVISIONED FOR YOU, YOU KNOW?

1223
00:33:21,133 --> 00:33:22,567
>> I KNOW.

1224
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:23,733
I REALLY DO APPRECIATE WHAT

1225
00:33:23,733 --> 00:33:25,267
YOU'RE DOING FOR US.

1226
00:33:25,267 --> 00:33:26,600
>> AND I KNOW YOU DO.

1227
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,600
IT'S NOT YOU.

1228
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,067
BUT I THINK WHAT WOULD MAKE IT

1229
00:33:30,067 --> 00:33:32,967
EASIER IS IF TONY WOULD BE

1230
00:33:32,967 --> 00:33:34,367
MORE REALISTIC ABOUT WHAT

1231
00:33:34,367 --> 00:33:35,733
THINGS COST AND REALISTIC

1232
00:33:35,733 --> 00:33:38,233
ABOUT HOW MUCH RESPONSIBILITY

1233
00:33:38,233 --> 00:33:41,167
THIS ALL IS.

1234
00:33:41,167 --> 00:33:42,067
>> IT REALLY BOTHERS ME

1235
00:33:42,067 --> 00:33:43,467
THAT TONY'S SELFISHNESS IS NOW

1236
00:33:43,467 --> 00:33:45,733
HURTING MY ENTIRE FAMILY.

1237
00:34:10,533 --> 00:34:13,833
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

1238
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:16,133
I DON'T LIKE LIVING HERE.

1239
00:34:16,133 --> 00:34:17,233
>> YOU KNOW WHAT, TONY?

1240
00:34:17,233 --> 00:34:18,233
PART OF ME WOULD LIKE YOU GUYS

1241
00:34:18,233 --> 00:34:19,133
TO MOVE OUT.

1242
00:34:19,133 --> 00:34:20,067
>> OKAY, MOM.

1243
00:34:20,067 --> 00:34:20,900
LET IT GO.

1244
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,733
>> NO.

1245
00:34:21,733 --> 00:34:23,600
I DON'T FEEL LIKE YOU REALLY

1246
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:25,833
KNOW HOW MUCH WE REALLY DO.

1247
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:27,067
>> I'LL START PAYING YOU

1248
00:34:27,067 --> 00:34:28,900
$300 A MONTH.

1249
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:29,767
>> TONY, I DON'T EXPECT

1250
00:34:29,767 --> 00:34:31,700
YOU TO PAY.

1251
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:33,767
I WOULD REALLY LIKE SOME

1252
00:34:33,767 --> 00:34:34,700
GRATEFULNESS.

1253
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:35,500
>> COULD YOU COME DOWN HERE,

1254
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:37,067
MOM, INSTEAD OF...

1255
00:34:37,067 --> 00:34:37,933
>> I DON'T WANT TO HAVE

1256
00:34:37,933 --> 00:34:39,067
THIS CONVERSATION.

1257
00:34:39,067 --> 00:34:39,900
>> WELL, THIS WAY IT KIND OF

1258
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:40,833
GIVES US AN IDEA--

1259
00:34:40,833 --> 00:34:41,767
>> I'M NOT GONNA MAKE YOU PAY

1260
00:34:41,767 --> 00:34:42,800
RENT.

1261
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,133
>> WELL, IF IT'S A BIG DEAL--

1262
00:34:44,133 --> 00:34:45,233
>> NO, IT'S NOT A BIG DEAL.

1263
00:34:45,233 --> 00:34:46,167
IT'S JUST THAT A LITTLE BIT

1264
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:47,233
OF GRAT--A LITTLE BIT

1265
00:34:47,233 --> 00:34:48,433
OF GRATEFULNESS.

1266
00:34:48,433 --> 00:34:49,633
>> DO I NOT SHOW APPRECIATION?

1267
00:34:49,633 --> 00:34:50,600
>> NOT LAST NIGHT, YOU DIDN'T.

1268
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,567
>> WHEN I [bleep] WORK MY ASS

1269
00:34:51,567 --> 00:34:53,100
OFF EVERY [bleep] DAY.

1270
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:53,867
I GO TO WORK EVERY [bleep]--

1271
00:34:53,867 --> 00:34:56,067
>> I DO TOO!

1272
00:34:56,067 --> 00:34:57,267
>> SERIOUSLY, GUYS, STOP.

1273
00:34:57,267 --> 00:34:58,067
I CAN'T DEAL WITH IT.

1274
00:34:58,067 --> 00:34:58,833
>> SEE, YOUR MOM'S [bleep]

1275
00:34:58,833 --> 00:34:59,400
CRAZY.

1276
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,567
I'M LEAVING.

1277
00:35:00,567 --> 00:35:01,433
>> I--TONY, I WORK EVERY--

1278
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:03,433
>> SHUT THE [bleep] UP, SYNDEE.

1279
00:35:03,433 --> 00:35:04,767
YOU'RE [bleep] CRAZY.

1280
00:35:04,767 --> 00:35:06,067
>> TONY, DON'T SIT THERE

1281
00:35:06,067 --> 00:35:07,067
AND TALK TO HER LIKE THAT.

1282
00:35:07,067 --> 00:35:07,700
>> IT'S FINE.

1283
00:35:07,700 --> 00:35:08,400
I CAN TAKE IT.

1284
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,167
IT'S FINE.

1285
00:35:09,167 --> 00:35:10,067
>> GIVE ME AMAYAH,

1286
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:11,067
GO WHEREVER YOU FREAKING PLEASE,

1287
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:11,767
BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA--

1288
00:35:11,767 --> 00:35:12,533
>> I'M [bleep] LEAVING.

1289
00:35:12,533 --> 00:35:13,200
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

1290
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:13,833
>> YEAH, CLEARLY--

1291
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:14,667
>> I GO TO WORK EVERY [bleep]

1292
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:15,400
DAY...

1293
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,233
>> I DO TOO.

1294
00:35:16,233 --> 00:35:17,433
>> I [bleep] WORK MY ASS OFF.

1295
00:35:17,433 --> 00:35:18,600
AND THEN I COME HOME AND I GET

1296
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:19,533
TO, I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S COMING

1297
00:35:19,533 --> 00:35:20,133
TO ME?

1298
00:35:20,133 --> 00:35:21,067
>> I DIDN'T SAY IT LIKE THAT.

1299
00:35:21,067 --> 00:35:22,567
>> SHUT THE [bleep] UP.

1300
00:35:22,567 --> 00:35:23,233
>> GET OUT.

1301
00:35:23,233 --> 00:35:24,067
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TALK TO HER

1302
00:35:24,067 --> 00:35:24,733
LIKE THAT.

1303
00:35:24,733 --> 00:35:25,400
>> [bleep] YOU.

1304
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,233
>> SERIOUSLY.

1305
00:35:27,233 --> 00:35:28,567
>> [bleep] I HATE THIS, TONY!

1306
00:35:28,567 --> 00:35:30,200
I HATE THIS!

1307
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:30,933
I HATE THIS!
