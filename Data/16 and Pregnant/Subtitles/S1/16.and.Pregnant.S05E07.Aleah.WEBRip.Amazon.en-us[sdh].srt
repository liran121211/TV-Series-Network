1
00:00:04,267 --> 00:00:06,333
>> WHOO!

2
00:00:06,333 --> 00:00:08,167
I'M ALEAH.

3
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:09,167
LET'S GO.

4
00:00:09,167 --> 00:00:11,333
I'M 18 AND LIVE JUST OUTSIDE

5
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:13,133
ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI.

6
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:14,567
I'M REALLY CLOSE TO MY MOM AND

7
00:00:14,567 --> 00:00:15,500
MY STEPDAD.

8
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,500
ADAM.

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,767
>> WHAT'S HAPPENING?

10
00:00:17,767 --> 00:00:19,667
>> BUT WHEN I WAS DIAGNOSED WITH

11
00:00:19,667 --> 00:00:21,633
TYPE 1 DIABETES, I WAS REALLY

12
00:00:21,633 --> 00:00:24,567
UPSET, SO I STARTED TO ACT OUT.

13
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:26,500
AFTER GETTING INTO A BAD FIGHT

14
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,400
WITH ANOTHER GIRL, I ENDED UP IN

15
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,100
JUVENILE DETENTION, WHICH IS

16
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,367
WHERE I MET MY BOYFRIEND OF TWO

17
00:00:31,367 --> 00:00:35,333
YEARS, SHAWN.

18
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:36,633
>> DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN WE FIRST

19
00:00:36,633 --> 00:00:37,833
MET EACH OTHER?

20
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:38,700
>> I DO.

21
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,033
>> AND I WINKED AT YOU.

22
00:00:40,033 --> 00:00:40,900
[laughs]

23
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:42,467
I FELT WEIRD DATING SOMEONE WHO

24
00:00:42,467 --> 00:00:44,533
HAD A KID, BUT I FELL IN LOVE

25
00:00:44,533 --> 00:00:47,000
WITH SHAWN AND HIS SON NOAH TOO.

26
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,167
>> I LOVE YOU.

27
00:00:48,167 --> 00:00:49,233
>> I LOVE YOU TOO.

28
00:00:49,233 --> 00:00:50,733
SINCE HIS MOM ISN'T AROUND,

29
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:52,367
I'VE BEEN HELPING RAISE HIM,

30
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:53,667
AND I'M ENROLLED IN COLLEGE TO

31
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:55,467
BE A MEDICAL ASSISTANT.

32
00:00:55,467 --> 00:00:57,300
I ALSO HAVE TO REMEMBER TO STAY

33
00:00:57,300 --> 00:00:58,933
ON TOP OF MY DIABETES BY

34
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,633
MONITORING MY BLOOD SUGAR AND

35
00:01:00,633 --> 00:01:01,933
USING AN INSULIN PUMP.

36
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:03,367
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT I

37
00:01:03,367 --> 00:01:05,067
TAKE MY CONDITION SERIOUSLY

38
00:01:05,067 --> 00:01:06,433
SINCE IT'S ALSO AFFECTING

39
00:01:06,433 --> 00:01:08,733
SOMEONE ELSE, BECAUSE I'M

40
00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:10,700
PREGNANT.

41
00:01:17,567 --> 00:01:19,500
IN TWO MONTHS I'LL BE HAVING

42
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:20,867
OUR DAUGHTER PEYTON.

43
00:01:20,867 --> 00:01:22,067
>> THAT'S GIRL PARTS.

44
00:01:22,067 --> 00:01:23,067
>> [laughs]

45
00:01:23,067 --> 00:01:24,667
WHEN SHAWN AND I FOUND OUT I WAS

46
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:26,333
PREGNANT, I WANTED TO STAY AT MY

47
00:01:26,333 --> 00:01:27,233
MOM'S.

48
00:01:27,233 --> 00:01:28,567
>> I GOT YOU GUYS SOME CLOTHES

49
00:01:28,567 --> 00:01:29,800
FOR THE BABY.

50
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:32,367
>> OH, THAT IS REALLY CUTE.

51
00:01:32,367 --> 00:01:33,900
BUT SHAWN'S WORK IS OVER AN HOUR

52
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,467
AWAY, SO WE DECIDED TO

53
00:01:35,467 --> 00:01:37,200
COMPROMISE AND LIVE WITH HIS

54
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,767
FAMILY, SO HE CAN PICK UP AS

55
00:01:38,767 --> 00:01:41,200
MANY SHIFTS AS POSSIBLE.

56
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,400
>> JUST SO YOU KNOW, I'M ALSO

57
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,433
WILLING TO WORK THIRD SHIFT.

58
00:01:43,433 --> 00:01:44,200
>> OKAY, SHAWN.

59
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,300
>> ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.

60
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,867
GOT TO MAKE MONEY SOMEHOW.

61
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,967
>> SHAWN HAS PROBLEMS SAVING

62
00:01:49,967 --> 00:01:51,400
MONEY BECAUSE OF SPEEDING

63
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,067
TICKETS AND COURT FINES.

64
00:01:54,067 --> 00:01:55,867
I HOPE HE'S DONE BEING RECKLESS,

65
00:01:55,867 --> 00:01:57,300
BECAUSE I REALLY WANT TO GET OUR

66
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,700
OWN PLACE.

67
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:01,067
[laughter]

68
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:01,967
>> OUR HOUSE IS GONNA BE ON A

69
00:02:01,967 --> 00:02:03,567
REAL STRICT DIET HERE SOON.

70
00:02:03,567 --> 00:02:04,700
YOU KNOW WITH HER DIABETES

71
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,633
SHE CAN'T HAVE REGULAR SYRUP.

72
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:09,733
>> HAS YOUR DIABETES BEEN GOING

73
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:11,067
UP AND DOWN LIKE IT WAS BEFORE

74
00:02:11,067 --> 00:02:11,800
OR...

75
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,600
>> I HAVE, LIKE, TIMES WHERE IT

76
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,200
WILL BE GOOD, YOU KNOW, AND THEN

77
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:18,067
IT SEEMS LIKE MY BODY JUST NEEDS

78
00:02:18,067 --> 00:02:19,700
MORE INSULIN, SO MY BLOOD SUGARS

79
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,300
ARE, LIKE, ALWAYS HIGH.

80
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,067
>> COULD IT, LIKE, GENETICALLY

81
00:02:23,067 --> 00:02:24,767
GO TO THE BABY, THE TYPE THAT

82
00:02:24,767 --> 00:02:25,667
YOU HAVE?

83
00:02:25,667 --> 00:02:27,367
>> NOT AS FAR AS GENETICALLY,

84
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:29,933
BUT IF MY BLOOD SUGARS WERE

85
00:02:29,933 --> 00:02:31,233
SUPER-UNCONTROLLED, SHE WOULD

86
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:33,100
HAVE A HIGH CHANCE OFF BECOMING

87
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,767
DIABETIC HERSELF.

88
00:02:34,767 --> 00:02:36,467
DO YOU WANT TO GO PLAY, BOO?

89
00:02:36,467 --> 00:02:37,867
ALL RIGHT, GOOD JOB EATING YOUR

90
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:39,233
BREAKFAST.

91
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:41,300
>> WHAT'S GONNA BE THE PLAN WITH

92
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:42,100
PEYTON?

93
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,333
LIKE, THE DAY THAT SHE COMES

94
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,067
HOME, ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO,

95
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:46,733
LIKE, STAY HERE?

96
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:48,800
>> WE HAVE, WHAT, EIGHT WEEKS

97
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,533
LEFT TILL SHE'S HERE?

98
00:02:49,533 --> 00:02:50,733
>> THAT EIGHT WEEKS IS FLYING

99
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:51,567
BY.

100
00:02:51,567 --> 00:02:53,667
>> I'M TAKING EVERY DAY OF THESE

101
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:55,167
EIGHT WEEKS TO TRY AND WORK AT

102
00:02:55,167 --> 00:02:57,567
THE PLASTICS FACTORY AND HOPING

103
00:02:57,567 --> 00:02:59,533
I CAN TAKE EVERY LAST DOLLAR I

104
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:00,733
HAVE AND PUT IT TOWARD THE PLACE

105
00:03:00,733 --> 00:03:01,400
FOR NOW.

106
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,767
>> MY GREATEST FEAR FOR YOU GUYS

107
00:03:02,767 --> 00:03:04,500
IS TO THINK YOU HAVE TO MOVE

108
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,167
OUT.

109
00:03:05,167 --> 00:03:06,667
I DON'T WANT YOU GUYS TO RUSH

110
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:08,600
INTO ANYTHING AND PUT YOURSELF

111
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
IN DEBT.

112
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:11,067
YOU'RE AT THE AGE TO WHERE I

113
00:03:11,067 --> 00:03:12,100
WAS.

114
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,300
I'M NOT GONNA SAY IT'S GONNA BE

115
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,533
EASY, BECAUSE AT 19 YEARS OLD

116
00:03:15,533 --> 00:03:19,067
WITH TWO KIDS...CAN BE ROUGH.

117
00:03:19,067 --> 00:03:20,400
HOW ARE YOU GONNA FEEL WHEN YOU

118
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,533
GO BACK TO SCHOOL,

119
00:03:21,533 --> 00:03:22,600
AND WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO IF

120
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:23,267
IT--

121
00:03:23,267 --> 00:03:25,267
>> I--I REALLY DON'T--DON'T WANT

122
00:03:25,267 --> 00:03:26,500
TO PUT HER IN DAY CARE.

123
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,967
BUT, I MEAN, I HATE TO PUT THE

124
00:03:27,967 --> 00:03:29,667
RESPONSIBILITY ON YOU GUYS--

125
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:30,867
>> THAT'S MY JOB.

126
00:03:30,867 --> 00:03:33,067
I SIT AT HOME, AND I BABYSIT.

127
00:03:33,067 --> 00:03:34,733
THAT'S PART OF BEING A GRANDMA.

128
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:35,800
>> I KNOW.

129
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,133
>> IF YOU GUYS CAN'T DO IT,

130
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:41,200
STAY HERE AND GET ON YOUR FEET.

131
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,633
>> I UNDERSTAND WHERE YOU'RE

132
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:45,067
COMING FROM.

133
00:03:45,067 --> 00:03:46,867
BUT HOPEFULLY, WE'LL HAVE OUR

134
00:03:46,867 --> 00:03:48,200
OWN PLACE BY THEN.

135
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,333
I'M REALLY HOPING SO.

136
00:03:49,333 --> 00:03:51,933
IT JUST DOESN'T SEEM THAT WAY,

137
00:03:51,933 --> 00:03:53,333
BECAUSE EVERY TIME WE TRY TO

138
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:57,300
SAVE MONEY, IT GETS BLOWN.

139
00:03:59,767 --> 00:04:00,967
>> AND THAT'S WHAT I'M WORRIED

140
00:04:00,967 --> 00:04:05,767
ABOUT.

141
00:04:05,767 --> 00:04:07,067
>> EVERYTHING IS GONNA CHANGE

142
00:04:07,067 --> 00:04:08,600
WHEN THE BABY COMES, SO WE'RE

143
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,733
SPENDING SOME TIME WITH OUR

144
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:11,600
FRIENDS WHILE WE STILL CAN.

145
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,967
HEY, GUYS.

146
00:04:12,967 --> 00:04:14,533
YOU GUYS READY TO GO HAVE A

147
00:04:14,533 --> 00:04:16,100
CONCERT IN THE CORN?

148
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,667
>> [together] YEAH.

149
00:04:20,667 --> 00:04:21,867
>> THIS IS KIND OF, LIKE, YOUR

150
00:04:21,867 --> 00:04:22,800
LAST DAY OUT, YOUR LAST FUN

151
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,500
TIME--

152
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,067
>> RIGHT, WE'RE TRYING OUR BEST

153
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:27,100
TO, LIKE, GO OUT NOW BEFORE

154
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,067
WE'RE TIED DOWN TO THE HOUSE ALL

155
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:30,533
DAY WITH A NEWBORN.

156
00:04:30,533 --> 00:04:31,667
>> HOW DO YOU FEEL ABOUT HAVING

157
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:33,333
TWO KIDS AT YOUR AGE?

158
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,700
LIKE, DID YOU EVER PICTURE--

159
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:36,767
>> NO, NEVER.

160
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:39,333
REMEMBER WHEN ME AND SHAWN

161
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,700
TOLD YOU GUYS WE WERE PREGNANT?

162
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:41,500
>> WELL, I THINK YOU SHOWED ME

163
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,167
THE TEST.

164
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:44,267
>> YES, I TOOK IT AT YOUR HOUSE.

165
00:04:44,267 --> 00:04:45,067
>> AND YOU SHOWED ME THE

166
00:04:45,067 --> 00:04:45,800
PREGNANCY TEST, AND YOU WERE

167
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,467
LIKE, "WHAT IS THIS?"

168
00:04:46,467 --> 00:04:47,700
AND I'M LIKE, "WHAT IS IT?"

169
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,667
AND WE KIND OF LOOKED AT IT FOR

170
00:04:48,667 --> 00:04:49,833
A SECOND.

171
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:50,700
>> I DIDN'T EVEN GET OFF THE

172
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,500
TOILET.

173
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:52,733
I JUST SAT ON THE TOILET AND

174
00:04:52,733 --> 00:04:53,533
CRIED.

175
00:04:53,533 --> 00:04:54,633
>> YOU KNOW WHAT'S FUNNY?

176
00:04:54,633 --> 00:04:55,867
WHEN YOU TEXTED ME AND TOLD ME,

177
00:04:55,867 --> 00:04:57,433
I WAS SITTING ON THE JOHN.

178
00:04:57,433 --> 00:04:58,733
[laughter]

179
00:04:58,733 --> 00:04:59,767
>> DID YOU USE ANY KIND OF

180
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,967
PROTECTION, ANY BIRTH CONTROL?

181
00:05:01,967 --> 00:05:03,267
>> I WAS ON DEPO WHENEVER WE

182
00:05:03,267 --> 00:05:06,667
WERE FIRST TOGETHER, AND THEN I

183
00:05:06,667 --> 00:05:09,300
GOT OFF OF DEPO AND STILL NEVER

184
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,400
HAD ANY PERIODS FOR MONTHS.

185
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,800
BUT THAT TEST SURE DIDN'T LIE

186
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,600
NOW, DID IT?

187
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,867
>> WHAT THOUGHT RAN THROUGH YOUR

188
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:18,100
MIND WHEN YOU FIRST, LIKE,

189
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,067
ACTUALLY KNEW?

190
00:05:19,067 --> 00:05:20,900
>> HOW AM I GONNA HAVE A

191
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,967
THREE-YEAR-OLD AND A NEWBORN

192
00:05:22,967 --> 00:05:23,867
BABY?

193
00:05:23,867 --> 00:05:25,367
>> DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA NOW?

194
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:26,200
>> NO.

195
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,300
[laughs]

196
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,200
>> I'M PRETTY SURE WHENEVER I

197
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,267
FOUND OUT ALEAH WAS PREGNANT,

198
00:05:29,267 --> 00:05:30,167
I DIDN'T HAVE SEX FOR, LIKE, A

199
00:05:30,167 --> 00:05:30,733
MONTH.

200
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:32,200
[laughter]

201
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,200

203
00:05:36,133 --> 00:05:37,433
>> UGH.

204
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:38,100
[laughs]

205
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:39,167
THIS HAYRIDE IS GONNA MAKE ME GO

206
00:05:39,167 --> 00:05:40,133
INTO LABOR.

207
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:41,433
[laughs]

208
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:43,633
>> * FEEL FREE TO

209
00:05:43,633 --> 00:05:44,967
* GO AND TAKE A RIDE

210
00:05:44,967 --> 00:05:46,733
*THIS AMERICAN DREAM *

211
00:05:46,733 --> 00:05:48,667
>> SHE WAS DANCING A MINUTE AGO.

212
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:51,300
SHE SAID, "I'M READY TO PARTY."

213
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,567
**

214
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:53,700
*YOU START A PARTY *

215
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,500
* THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET

216
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,900
*SAY WHAT YOU WANT TO SAY *

217
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,400

*WHOA, OH-OH-OH, OH-OH-OH *

219
00:06:01,367 --> 00:06:05,933
>> WHOO!

220
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:07,300
>> HAVING NOAH IN MY LIFE REALLY

221
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,733
MADE ME REALIZE HOW HARD IT IS

222
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:09,667
TO RAISE A CHILD.

223
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:10,900
>> HERE.

224
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,067
BRUSH 'EM GOOD.

225
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:13,233
>> AND NOW IT'S GOING TO BE

226
00:06:13,233 --> 00:06:14,433
TWICE AS HARD WHEN PEYTON

227
00:06:14,433 --> 00:06:15,167
ARRIVES.

228
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:18,067
>> GET YOUR BACK TEETH.

229
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:19,533
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO GET DRESSED.

230
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:21,067
HOLD YOUR TOWEL UP.

231
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:21,800
>> COME HERE, BABY.

232
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,700
>> OKAY.

233
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:25,767
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GET IN BED.

234
00:06:25,767 --> 00:06:26,433
>> HOLD ON.

235
00:06:26,433 --> 00:06:27,733
BEFORE HE LAYS DOWN, CAN I HAVE

236
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:31,767
A HUG AND KISS?

237
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,067
GIVE ME A HUG.

238
00:06:33,067 --> 00:06:34,633
>> DADDY.

239
00:06:34,633 --> 00:06:36,433
>> WHAT?

240
00:06:36,433 --> 00:06:37,933
>> GIVE ME A KISS.

241
00:06:37,933 --> 00:06:39,100
YOU DON'T GET NO CARTOONS

242
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,267
TONIGHT, BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T

243
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:41,400
LISTEN TO DADDY LAST NIGHT,

244
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:42,667
OKAY?

245
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:44,400
BUT IF YOU DO GOOD TONIGHT AND

246
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,233
YOU GO TO BED LIKE A BIG BOY,

247
00:06:46,233 --> 00:06:47,700
YOU CAN GET CARTOONS TOMORROW.

248
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,067
DOES THAT SOUND FAIR?

249
00:06:50,067 --> 00:06:51,067
NO?

250
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:52,200
WELL, THAT'S THE WAY IT WORKS,

251
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:52,900
DUDE.

252
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,067
GIVE ME A HIGH FIVE.

253
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:57,900
GIVE DADDY A HUG AND KISS.

254
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,500
YES, YOU DID, BUT OKAY.

255
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,700
>> ANYTHING TO STAY OUT OF BED A

256
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:05,400
LITTLE LONGER.

257
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,900
KISS.

258
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:07,567
GOOD NIGHT.

259
00:07:07,567 --> 00:07:08,367
I LOVE YOU.

260
00:07:08,367 --> 00:07:09,433
I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING,

261
00:07:09,433 --> 00:07:10,200
OKAY?

262
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,067
>> GOOD NIGHT.

263
00:07:11,067 --> 00:07:13,067
I LOVE YOU.

264
00:07:20,967 --> 00:07:21,633
>> HI.

265
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:22,533
>> HI.

266
00:07:22,533 --> 00:07:24,567
BECAUSE OF MY DIABETES, I'M

267
00:07:24,567 --> 00:07:26,067
MEETING WITH A LABOR COACH TO

268
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:27,533
HELP ME DEAL WITH MY HIGH-RISK

269
00:07:27,533 --> 00:07:29,067
PREGNANCY.

270
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:30,367
>> YOU KNOW THAT THE RISK WITH

271
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:32,067
DIABETES DURING PREGNANCY AND

272
00:07:32,067 --> 00:07:34,433
DELIVERY ARE FEW BUT PRETTY

273
00:07:34,433 --> 00:07:36,067
SERIOUS, RIGHT?

274
00:07:36,067 --> 00:07:37,767
>> HONESTLY, WHENEVER YOU GET

275
00:07:37,767 --> 00:07:39,267
PREGNANT AS A TEENAGER,

276
00:07:39,267 --> 00:07:41,833
YOU DON'T THINK, YOU KNOW, "OH,

277
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:43,567
I HAVE ALL THESE HEALTH ISSUES

278
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:44,967
TO DEAL WITH."

279
00:07:44,967 --> 00:07:46,833
YOU THINK OF, LIKE, YOU KNOW,

280
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,633
"HOW AM I GONNA FINISH SCHOOL?

281
00:07:48,633 --> 00:07:50,967
HOW AM I GONNA PROVIDE FOR THIS

282
00:07:50,967 --> 00:07:51,633
BABY?"

283
00:07:51,633 --> 00:07:52,700
YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHERE MY MIND

284
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,767
WAS WHENEVER I GOT PREGNANT.

285
00:07:54,767 --> 00:07:55,867
WHAT HAVE YOUR DOCTORS GONE OVER

286
00:07:55,867 --> 00:07:58,533
WITH YOU SO FAR?

287
00:07:58,533 --> 00:08:00,767
>> I HAVE REALLY ROLLER-COASTER

288
00:08:00,767 --> 00:08:03,067
BLOOD SUGARS.

289
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:04,867
WHEN I FOUND OUT I WAS PREGNANT,

290
00:08:04,867 --> 00:08:07,067
I WENT TO THE HOSPITAL, AND THE

291
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:08,567
DOCTOR TOLD ME, "YOU HAVE, LIKE,

292
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:09,900
A 50-50 CHANCE OF EVEN CARRYING

293
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:11,467
THIS BABY."

294
00:08:11,467 --> 00:08:12,133
>> YEAH.

295
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:13,067
>> HE WAS LIKE, "YOU'RE PROBABLY

296
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:14,400
JUST GONNA HAVE A MISCARRIAGE,

297
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,433
TO BE HONEST."

298
00:08:15,433 --> 00:08:18,933
>> AND ANOTHER RISK WITH TYPE 1

299
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:22,167
DIABETES IS A PREMATURE BABY

300
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:23,633
THAT MIGHT NEED TO BE DELIVERED

301
00:08:23,633 --> 00:08:25,733
BECAUSE OF COMPLICATIONS WITH

302
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:26,600
THE BLOOD SUGARS.

303
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,267
>> RIGHT.

304
00:08:27,267 --> 00:08:32,067
>> OKAY, SO THE ULTIMATE RISK

305
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:33,333
IS, OF COURSE, DELIVERING A

306
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,133
STILLBORN BABY.

307
00:08:35,133 --> 00:08:36,167
>> RIGHT.

308
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:39,867
>> THAT STILLBORN DELIVERY IS--

309
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:41,067
IS HARD.

310
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:42,700
IT'S HARD TO THINK ABOUT.

311
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:44,533
IT'S HARD TO TALK ABOUT WITH

312
00:08:44,533 --> 00:08:47,867
PEOPLE, BUT IT'S A REALITY.

313
00:08:47,867 --> 00:08:49,100
>> I THINK THAT I WOULD JUST

314
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,833
FEEL SO BAD IF SOMETHING WOULD

315
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,367
BE WRONG WITH HER.

316
00:08:52,367 --> 00:08:53,967
IT JUST SEEMS LIKE EVEN THOUGH

317
00:08:53,967 --> 00:08:56,100
I'M TAKING GOOD CARE OF MYSELF,

318
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,633
ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE OUT OF

319
00:08:57,633 --> 00:08:58,700
MY CONTROL.

320
00:08:58,700 --> 00:09:02,167
LIKE, I'VE TRIED MY BEST TO TAKE

321
00:09:02,167 --> 00:09:03,900
CONTROL OF MY DIABETES, BUT

322
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:05,200
ALL OF THESE THINGS ARE STILL,

323
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
LIKE, STACKING UP AGAINST ME.

324
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:16,200
>> SO YOU'RE ALMOST THERE.

325
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,933
ARE YOU EXCITED YET?

326
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:20,067
>> KIND OF, BUT THEN, LIKE, THE

327
00:09:20,067 --> 00:09:21,367
FURTHER ALONG I GET, THE MORE

328
00:09:21,367 --> 00:09:26,133
NERVOUS I GET.

329
00:09:26,133 --> 00:09:27,533
AND THEN WE WON'T HAVE TO WORRY

330
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:28,433
SO MUCH.

331
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:29,333
>> YEAH.

332
00:09:29,333 --> 00:09:30,533
>> THAT'S THE BIGGEST FEAR FOR

333
00:09:30,533 --> 00:09:34,500
ME, THAT SHE'LL COME EARLY.

334
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,067
WHENEVER YOU TOLD ME THAT YOU

335
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:38,433
WERE PREGNANT, I HAD THE SAME

336
00:09:38,433 --> 00:09:40,367
FEELING AS I DID THE DAY THAT

337
00:09:40,367 --> 00:09:42,567
THEY TOLD ME THAT YOU HAD

338
00:09:42,567 --> 00:09:44,467
DIABETES.

339
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:46,267
WE WERE BOTH TRYING TO ABSORB

340
00:09:46,267 --> 00:09:49,067
IT AND FREAKING OUT ALL AT THE

341
00:09:49,067 --> 00:09:51,433
SAME TIME.

342
00:09:51,433 --> 00:09:52,967
I JUST FELT LIKE, "NOW

343
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,133
EVERYTHING CHANGES,

344
00:09:55,133 --> 00:09:56,333
AND YOU'VE GOT TO REALLY TAKE

345
00:09:56,333 --> 00:09:59,333
CARE OF YOURSELF NOW."

346
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,400
>> I MEAN, THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

347
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,733
I WORRY ABOUT ALL THE TIME, YOU

348
00:10:01,733 --> 00:10:03,133
KNOW.

349
00:10:03,133 --> 00:10:04,567
EVERY TIME MY BLOOD SUGAR IS

350
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:07,000
HIGH, I, LIKE, FREAK OUT, AND

351
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,633
HONESTLY, I CRY, BECAUSE THERE'S

352
00:10:09,633 --> 00:10:11,367
A WHOLE LOT OF THINGS THAT COULD

353
00:10:11,367 --> 00:10:12,933
GO WRONG, AND NOW THAT I'M

354
00:10:12,933 --> 00:10:14,600
PREGNANT, ANY TIME IT'S, LIKE,

355
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,533
OVER 150, THERE'S, LIKE,

356
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:19,233
IMMEDIATE CONSEQUENCES FOR IT.

357
00:10:19,233 --> 00:10:22,133
I JUST--I WANT TO GIVE HER THE

358
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:23,533
BEST SHOT THAT I CAN.

359
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:25,533
>> THAT'S IT.

360
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,867
>> EVEN WITH MANAGING MY

361
00:10:42,867 --> 00:10:44,667
DIABETES, I NEED TO KEEP UP WITH

362
00:10:44,667 --> 00:10:46,167
SCHOOL SINCE I'M GOING TO TAKE

363
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:47,433
TWO MONTHS OFF WHEN PEYTON

364
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:48,767
ARRIVES, AND I DON'T WANT TO

365
00:10:48,767 --> 00:10:49,900
FALL BEHIND.

366
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,967
SO WOULD YOU SET THAT UP X OVER

367
00:10:51,967 --> 00:10:53,867
20 EQUALS 40 OVER 100?

368
00:10:53,867 --> 00:10:56,800
>> EXACTLY, EXACTLY.

369
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,267
>> WITH EVERYTHING ELSE ON MY

370
00:10:58,267 --> 00:11:00,067
PLATE, THE CHAOS AT SHAWN'S

371
00:11:00,067 --> 00:11:01,633
HOUSE CAN BE OVERWHELMING.

372
00:11:01,633 --> 00:11:02,500
>> DEVIN DID IT.

373
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,367
>> YOU DID IT.

374
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:04,067
>> I DIDN'T

375
00:11:04,067 --> 00:11:04,967
I SWEAR.

376
00:11:04,967 --> 00:11:06,533
>> NIGHT-NIGHTTIME.

377
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:07,200
GOOD NIGHT.

378
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,833
I LOVE YOU.

379
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,300
I REALLY WANT TO GET OUR OWN

380
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,867
PLACE, BUT SHAWN CAME HOME WITH

381
00:11:11,867 --> 00:11:16,433
ANOTHER SPEEDING TICKET.

382
00:11:16,433 --> 00:11:19,367
AND I HAD--STICK SHIFTS ARE

383
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:21,133
REALLY EASY TO SPEED IN.

384
00:11:21,133 --> 00:11:23,600
>> YOU MAKE ME SO MAD.

385
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,533
YOU NEED TO SLOW DOWN.

386
00:11:25,533 --> 00:11:26,900
AND WE NEED TO BE MORE CAREFUL

387
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,833
ABOUT REALLY WRITING DOWN HOW

388
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,967
MUCH MONEY NEEDS TO BE PAID.

389
00:11:30,967 --> 00:11:32,067
>> I'M DEFINITELY REALIZING IT'S

390
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,400
NOT WORTH THE SPEEDING.

391
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,067
>> [sighs]

392
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:37,467
AS FAR AS THE NOISE LEVEL IN

393
00:11:37,467 --> 00:11:38,667
THIS HOUSE BEING AN

394
00:11:38,667 --> 00:11:41,200
ALL-THE-TIME THING, YOU KNOW,

395
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,367
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU

396
00:11:42,367 --> 00:11:43,533
WOULD WANT TO HAVE A BABY AROUND

397
00:11:43,533 --> 00:11:45,100
ALL OF THE TIME.

398
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,500
HOW REALISTIC IS IT FOR US TO

399
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,600
GET OUR OWN PLACE BEFORE PEYTON

400
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,800
GETS HERE?

401
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,433
>> IF I DO GET MY 40 HOURS AT

402
00:11:54,433 --> 00:11:56,533
THE PLASTIC FACTORY, I'LL BRING

403
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:58,600
HOME, LIKE, 200 A WEEK IF THE

404
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,067
WORK STAYS STEADY.

405
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:01,867
I DIDN'T GET WORK LAST WEEK, SO

406
00:12:01,867 --> 00:12:02,933
I'VE GOT NO MONEY COMING IN THIS

407
00:12:02,933 --> 00:12:03,600
WEEK.

408
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,167
AS OF NOW, I'M NOT MAKING MUCH

409
00:12:05,167 --> 00:12:06,467
FOR NEXT WEEK EITHER.

410
00:12:06,467 --> 00:12:09,733
IT'S STARTING TO LOOK MORE AND

411
00:12:09,733 --> 00:12:11,467
MORE LIKE IT'S GONNA BE

412
00:12:11,467 --> 00:12:13,467
IMPOSSIBLE TO GET A PLACE IN

413
00:12:13,467 --> 00:12:15,067
TIME,

414
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,733
AND I APOLOGIZE.

415
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:23,600
>> I'M DUE IN A MONTH, AND SINCE

416
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,067
WE'RE TIGHT ON MONEY, I'M REALLY

417
00:12:25,067 --> 00:12:26,167
GLAD MY MOM IS THROWING US A

418
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:30,500
BABY SHOWER.

419
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,933
>> OKAY, YOU ALL ARE GONNA TAKE

420
00:12:32,933 --> 00:12:34,600
THESE BALLOONS AND PUT THEM

421
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,100
UNDER YOUR SHIRT LIKE YOU'RE

422
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,933
PREGNANT LIKE ALEAH.

423
00:12:37,933 --> 00:12:39,467
>> YOU WANT TO BELLY BUMP?

424
00:12:39,467 --> 00:12:41,133
YOU DON'T WANT THIS?

425
00:12:41,133 --> 00:12:44,200
YEAH, YOU RIP THAT OPEN.

426
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:45,867
>> WHOO.

427
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:47,967
WE GOT OURSELVES A CAR SEAT

428
00:12:47,967 --> 00:12:49,400
AND A STROLLER.

429
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,767
"I'M FOLLOWING HIM IN MOMMY'S

430
00:12:50,767 --> 00:12:53,367
FOOTSTEPS."

431
00:12:53,367 --> 00:12:54,567
THE BEGINNING OF PEYTON'S

432
00:12:54,567 --> 00:12:56,133
COLLEGE FUND.

433
00:12:56,133 --> 00:12:57,967
>> OH, BOY.

434
00:12:57,967 --> 00:12:59,267
>> SINCE THE SHOWER WAS NEAR MY

435
00:12:59,267 --> 00:13:00,967
MOM'S, WE DECIDED TO STAY WITH

436
00:13:00,967 --> 00:13:02,600
HER THAT NIGHT.

437
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,500
YOU GONNA GO NIGHT-NIGHT LIKE A

438
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,167
BIG BOY?

439
00:13:04,167 --> 00:13:04,833
>> YEAH.

440
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:05,900
>> ALL RIGHT, HERE'S YOUR

441
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,067
SPONGEBOB.

442
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:09,867
I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING,

443
00:13:09,867 --> 00:13:10,467
OKAY?

444
00:13:10,467 --> 00:13:12,733
>> OKAY.

445
00:13:12,733 --> 00:13:14,067
>> IS THAT IT?

446
00:13:14,067 --> 00:13:15,067
>> YEP.

447
00:13:15,067 --> 00:13:16,633
>> I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE TO

448
00:13:16,633 --> 00:13:17,700
START WITH ALL OF THIS STUFF.

449
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,400
>> YEAH, I WAS THINKING THE SAME

450
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,900
THING.

451
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,700
[device chimes]

452
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,300
WHAT'S THAT SAYING?

453
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,367
>> DON'T JUST MUTE IT.

454
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:27,500
>> [laughs]

455
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,367
CHECK MY BLOOD SUGAR.

456
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:30,233
>> WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME YOU

457
00:13:30,233 --> 00:13:30,933
CHECKED YOUR BLOOD?

458
00:13:30,933 --> 00:13:33,467
>> LAST TIME I CHECKED IT WAS

459
00:13:33,467 --> 00:13:36,067
BEFORE WE STARTED REALLY

460
00:13:36,067 --> 00:13:37,867
CLEANING UP FOR THE BABY SHOWER.

461
00:13:37,867 --> 00:13:39,067
>> I FIGURED YOU'D CHECKED IT

462
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:41,067
WHEN WE GOT HERE.

463
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:44,067
>> IT'S 285.

464
00:13:44,067 --> 00:13:45,500
>> UH-OH.

465
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,867
YOUR BLOOD SUGAR HAS BEEN JACKED

466
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,633
THE PAST COUPLE DAYS.

467
00:13:48,633 --> 00:13:50,067
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

468
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:51,200
>> YOU'RE EITHER SUPER HIGH OR

469
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:52,500
SUPER LOW.

470
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,867
>> THIS IS NOT GOOD STUFF

471
00:13:54,867 --> 00:13:56,867
AT ALL.

472
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:04,167
I'M NOT VERY HAPPY ABOUT IT.

473
00:14:04,167 --> 00:14:05,867
LIKE, A NORMAL DIABETIC'S BLOOD

474
00:14:05,867 --> 00:14:08,267
SUGAR SHOULD BE 80 TO 180.

475
00:14:11,967 --> 00:14:14,300
WITH NUMBERS LIKE THESE,

476
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:15,467
THINGS AREN'T LOOKING VERY GOOD

477
00:14:15,467 --> 00:14:18,967
FOR HER.

478
00:14:18,967 --> 00:14:22,167
IT JUST SUCKS.

479
00:14:22,167 --> 00:14:23,667
>> GONNA BE OKAY.

480
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:25,667
IT'S ALL GONNA BE OKAY.

481
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,433
>> BUT THAT NIGHT THINGS GOT

482
00:14:30,433 --> 00:14:32,067
WORSE, AND MY DOCTOR TOLD ME TO

483
00:14:32,067 --> 00:14:33,667
GO TO THE HOSPITAL.

484
00:14:33,667 --> 00:14:35,567
MY MOM HAD TO GO TO WORK, SO

485
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:37,067
SHAWN IS STAYING WITH NOAH WHILE

486
00:14:37,067 --> 00:14:38,667
I GO TO THE E.R. TO FIGURE OUT

487
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:40,833
WHAT'S GOING ON.

488
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:43,100
THEY STARTED ME ON AN I.V. TO

489
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,500
HELP REGULATE MY BLOOD SUGAR

490
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,900
LEVELS, BUT I'M REALLY WORRIED

491
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,267
ABOUT PEYTON.

492
00:14:47,267 --> 00:14:48,600
>> HOW DO YOU FEEL?

493
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,133
>> TIRED.

494
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:53,433
I KIND OF BAWLED MY EYES OUT A

495
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:54,100
LITTLE BIT.

496
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:55,700
I DON'T KNOW.

497
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:58,067
THE DOCTOR SAID THAT THE MAIN

498
00:14:58,067 --> 00:14:59,433
REASON WHY HE REALLY WANTS TO

499
00:14:59,433 --> 00:15:00,633
GET MY BLOOD SUGARS UNDER

500
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:03,200
CONTROL IS BECAUSE HE DOESN'T

501
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,300
WANT TO CHANCE AT STILLBIRTH.

502
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,067
>> HE SAID THAT?

503
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:11,700
>> YEAH.

504
00:15:20,167 --> 00:15:21,800
>> SHAWN TOOK NOAH TO HIS MOM'S

505
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,100
HOUSE SO HE COULD COME BE WITH

506
00:15:23,100 --> 00:15:25,533
ME AT THE HOSPITAL.

507
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:27,467
MY BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS ARE STILL

508
00:15:27,467 --> 00:15:29,300
OUT OF CONTROL, SO AFTER A

509
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,067
COUPLE OF TESTS, THE DOCTORS

510
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:32,900
DECIDED TO DELIVER PEYTON THREE

511
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,900
WEEKS EARLY.

512
00:15:41,533 --> 00:15:42,533
>> HEY.

513
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:43,967
>> IT'S ABOUT TIME.

514
00:15:43,967 --> 00:15:45,400
>> HI, HONEY.

515
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,267
>> NICE TO SEE YOU.

516
00:15:46,267 --> 00:15:47,333
>> WHAT'S UP, BOSS?

517
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,533
PRETTY MAMA.

518
00:15:48,533 --> 00:15:49,433
>> HI.

519
00:15:49,433 --> 00:15:50,700
>> HOW YOU FEELING?

00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:53,533
CONTRACTIONS.

522
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:55,067
>> HOW FAR APART ARE THEY?

523
00:15:55,067 --> 00:15:56,233
>> LIKE, A MINUTE.

524
00:15:56,233 --> 00:15:57,433
>> THAT CAN GO ON A LONG TIME,

525
00:15:57,433 --> 00:15:58,433
THOUGH.

526
00:15:58,433 --> 00:15:59,467

00:16:01,533 --> 00:16:02,967
LET'S GET IT GOING, MAN.

529
00:16:02,967 --> 00:16:07,067
LET'S GET THOSE FORCEPS UP.

530
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:08,933

WITH IT?

534
00:16:14,067 --> 00:16:15,267
>> I AM IN SO MUCH PAIN.

535
00:16:15,267 --> 00:16:16,700
I THINK I MIGHT THROW UP.

536
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,767

>> OH, MY GOSH.

564
00:17:23,233 --> 00:17:24,700
>> SHE'S SO CUTE.

565
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:29,400
>> SHE IS SO CUTE.

566
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,333
>> *YEAH, OH *

567
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:39,167
>> AFTER THE DELIVERY, WE

568
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:41,333
THOUGHT WE WERE IN THE CLEAR,

569
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:42,900
BUT THE DOCTORS NOTICED SHE WAS

570
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:44,867
HAVING TROUBLE BREATHING, SO

571
00:17:44,867 --> 00:17:46,133
THEY RUSHED HER TO INTENSIVE

572
00:17:46,133 --> 00:17:48,133
CARE.

573
00:17:51,633 --> 00:17:53,167
MY PREGNANCY, THERE WAS

574
00:17:53,167 --> 00:17:55,467
JUST ALWAYS SOMETHING GOING ON.

575
00:17:55,467 --> 00:17:59,433
SHE WAS IN RISK OF A STILLBIRTH,

576
00:17:59,433 --> 00:18:01,467
AND I JUST COULDN'T WAIT TO HAVE

577
00:18:01,467 --> 00:18:02,933
HER SO THAT I COULD QUIT

578
00:18:02,933 --> 00:18:04,433
WORRYING ABOUT STUFF LIKE THAT,

579
00:18:04,433 --> 00:18:06,433
BUT...

580
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,133
YEAH.

581
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,133
I JUST WANT HER HERE.

582
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,833
>> IN INTENSIVE CARE, THEY FOUND

583
00:18:41,833 --> 00:18:43,267
OUT PEYTON IS SUFFERING FROM LOW

584
00:18:43,267 --> 00:18:44,867
BLOOD SUGAR, SO THEY PUT HER ON

585
00:18:44,867 --> 00:18:47,333
AN I.V. TO HELP STABILIZE HER.

586
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,867
PEYTON'S BLOOD SUGAR KEEPS

587
00:18:48,867 --> 00:18:49,800
DROPPING.

588
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,133
SHE DOESN'T HAVE THAT SUGAR

589
00:18:51,133 --> 00:18:52,733
COMING FROM ME ANYMORE, SO SHE'S

590
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:54,533
BOTTOMING OUT.

591
00:18:54,533 --> 00:18:55,800
>> SO THEY ENDED UP HAVING TO

592
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,067
STICK THE I.V. IN HER

593
00:18:57,067 --> 00:18:58,167
TO GIVE HER SOME SUGAR.

594
00:18:58,167 --> 00:18:59,200
>> YEAH.

595
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:00,967
APPARENTLY, IT'S REALLY COMMON

596
00:19:00,967 --> 00:19:04,733
IN, LIKE, ALL DIABETIC WOMEN.

597
00:19:04,733 --> 00:19:07,233
>> HEY, WE HAVE NORMAL FOOD.

598
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:09,800
>> OH, YOU'RE THE BEST.

599
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,433
MY VAGINA HURTS.

600
00:19:11,433 --> 00:19:12,633
>> I COULD IMAGINE.

601
00:19:12,633 --> 00:19:14,067
>> I FELT HER HEAD PASS MY PUBIC

602
00:19:14,067 --> 00:19:15,100
BONE.

603
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,067
I FELT HER SHOULDERS COME OUT.

604
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:17,700
I FELT EVERYTHING.

605
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:18,500
>> THAT SOUNDS TERRIBLE.

606
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,333
>> IT WAS TERRIBLE.

607
00:19:19,333 --> 00:19:20,133
>> DUDE, THAT WAS THE LOUDEST

608
00:19:20,133 --> 00:19:21,067
SCREAM I'VE EVER HEARD IN MY

609
00:19:21,067 --> 00:19:21,600
LIFE.

610
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,267
>> [laughs]

611
00:19:22,267 --> 00:19:23,767
>> AND I TOLD THEM--I WAS LIKE,

612
00:19:23,767 --> 00:19:24,567
"I HAVE TO POOP.

613
00:19:24,567 --> 00:19:25,633
I REALLY HAVE TO POOP.

614
00:19:25,633 --> 00:19:26,833
LIKE, GET ME A BEDPAN.

615
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,800
I'M GONNA GO ALL OVER THIS BED."

616
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:29,500
[laughter]

617
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,833
AND SHE WAS LIKE, "NO, YOU DON'T

618
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:31,533
HAVE TO POOP.

619
00:19:31,533 --> 00:19:32,500
THAT'S THE BABY'S HEAD.

620
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,767
IT'S PUSHING ON YOUR RECTUM.

621
00:19:33,767 --> 00:19:34,800
IT MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOU

622
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,133
REALLY HAVE TO POOP."

623
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:37,600
AND THEN SHE CHECKED ME, AND SHE

624
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,567
WAS LIKE, "YEAH, YOU'RE READY TO

625
00:19:38,567 --> 00:19:39,267
GO.

626
00:19:39,267 --> 00:19:40,100
LET'S GET YOU READY TO START

627
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:40,733

628
00:19:40,733 --> 00:19:41,400
>> REALLY?

629
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,067
>> YEAH.

630
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:42,800
>> YOU THOUGHT YOUR BABY WAS

631
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:43,467
POOP.

632
00:19:43,467 --> 00:19:44,433
THAT'S KIND OF FUNNY.

633
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,667
>> WHEN I GO POOP AND I'M

634
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:47,067
PUSHING FOR 30 MINUTES, I

635
00:19:47,067 --> 00:19:48,500
USUALLY JUST GET UP, SO...

636
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,067

637
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:52,633
>> WE STAYED WITH PEYTON FOR A

638
00:19:52,633 --> 00:19:54,300
EXTRA DAYS IN THE HOSPITAL,

639
00:19:54,300 --> 00:19:56,167
AND WE WERE SO HAPPY WHEN WE

640
00:19:56,167 --> 00:19:57,433
WERE TOLD EVERYTHING HAD

641
00:19:57,433 --> 00:19:59,467
STABILIZED.

642
00:19:59,467 --> 00:20:02,033
PEYTON'S GONNA GO HOME TODAY.

643
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:02,833

650
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,667

678
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:09,767
EVENTUALLY TO HAVE DIABETES?

00:23:45,333 --> 00:23:47,067
DECENT-SIZED ROOMS.

751
00:23:47,067 --> 00:23:48,500
>> THERE'S A HALF BATH,

752
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,767
WASHER AND DRIER HOOKUPS

753
00:23:49,767 --> 00:23:51,200
IN THE UTILITY ROOM.

754
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,433
>> I LIKE IT.

755
00:23:52,433 --> 00:23:53,333
>> NEW DISHWASHER.

756
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:54,833
THAT'S BRAND-NEW.

757
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,067
DO YOU CHARGE A DEPOSIT?

758
00:23:56,067 --> 00:23:57,233
>> YEAH, THE DEPOSIT IS THE SAME

759
00:23:57,233 --> 00:23:59,200
AS THE RENT, 550 RENT, 550

760
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,467
DEPOSIT.

761
00:24:00,467 --> 00:24:05,433
>> OKAY.

762
00:24:05,433 --> 00:24:07,467
[exhales]

763
00:24:07,467 --> 00:24:08,533
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

764
00:24:08,533 --> 00:24:09,933
>> IT'S DECENT.

765
00:24:09,933 --> 00:24:11,533
>> AS FAR AS THE LOCATION GOES,

766
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,300
THIS PLACE IS PERFECT.

767
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,433
WHAT DO YOU THINK, MAMA?

768
00:24:15,433 --> 00:24:17,400
DO YOU LIKE IT?

769
00:24:22,367 --> 00:24:23,767
I THINK THAT IF WE GOT OUR OWN

770
00:24:23,767 --> 00:24:26,400
PLACE, IT WOULD HELP WITH SO

771
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,067
MANY DIFFERENT THINGS.

772
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:30,533
LET'S START A BUDGET.

773
00:24:30,533 --> 00:24:31,533
ELECTRIC...

774
00:24:31,533 --> 00:24:33,600
I'LL PUT 160.

775
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,367
OUR PHONE BILL...

776
00:24:35,367 --> 00:24:36,367
>> $50 A MONTH.

777
00:24:36,367 --> 00:24:38,333
>> CAR INSURANCE.

778
00:24:38,333 --> 00:24:39,733
MINE'S 100.

779
00:24:39,733 --> 00:24:41,267
>> MINE'S 60.

780
00:24:41,267 --> 00:24:43,233
>> AM I MISSING SOMETHING?

781
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:45,967
>> YEAH, THE SPEEDING TICKETS.

782
00:24:45,967 --> 00:24:47,267
>> HOW MUCH DO YOU OWE TO THE

783
00:24:47,267 --> 00:24:48,433
COURTS FOR YOUR SPEEDING

784
00:24:48,433 --> 00:24:49,900
TICKETS?

785
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:53,067
>> SO I CALLED ALL THE COURTS,

786
00:24:53,067 --> 00:24:54,633
AND I FIGURED THE TOTAL AMOUNT

787
00:24:54,633 --> 00:24:58,800
THAT I OWE THEM, AND THIS I WHAT

788
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,367
I CAME UP WITH, EXCEPT IN

789
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:03,767
HILLSBORO, I HAVE THE SAME

790
00:25:03,767 --> 00:25:05,767
CHARGE AGAIN, SO IT'S VIRTUALLY

791
00:25:05,767 --> 00:25:07,767
GONNA BE THE SAME EXACT FINE

792
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:15,200
PLUS A $135 CLASS ON TOP OF IT.

793
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,200
>> 2,500.

794
00:25:20,433 --> 00:25:23,767
I'M NOT INITIATING WHY THAT IS

795
00:25:23,767 --> 00:25:26,500
SO RIDICULOUSLY HIGH FOR SOME

796
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,367
SPEEDING TICKETS.

797
00:25:28,367 --> 00:25:33,700
>> WELL, HONESTLY,

798
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,333
I DIDN'T PAY MY SPEEDING TICKETS

799
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:37,200
IN TIME, SO THAT DOUBLES THE

800
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,500
FINE.

801
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,067
>> THIS DEFINITELY SLOWS DOWN

802
00:25:42,067 --> 00:25:43,500
THE PROCESS OF GETTING OUR OWN

803
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,267
PLACE.

804
00:25:45,267 --> 00:25:48,167
I'M JUST TRYING--REALLY TRYING

805
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:51,567
MY HARDEST NOT TO GET MAD ABOUT

806
00:25:51,567 --> 00:25:53,567
IT.

807
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,900
>> SHAWN.

808
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:08,233
>> I CAN'T LET GO OF THESE

809
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,600
SPEEDING TICKETS, SHAWN.

810
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,067
>> WHY?

811
00:26:11,067 --> 00:26:12,467
>> BECAUSE IF YOU WOULD STAY ON

812
00:26:12,467 --> 00:26:13,867
TOP OF YOUR COURTS, YOU

813
00:26:13,867 --> 00:26:15,067
WOULDN'T HAVE ALL OF THE FINES

814
00:26:15,067 --> 00:26:17,467
THAT YOU HAVE.

815
00:26:17,467 --> 00:26:18,533
I MEAN, IS THAT A LIE?

816
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:19,933
>> YOU'RE TELLING ME?

817
00:26:19,933 --> 00:26:20,767
I'VE BEEN PISSED OFF.

818
00:26:20,767 --> 00:26:21,700
YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY I HAD IN

819
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,100
MY WALLET AND AIN'T NONE OF IT

820
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,600
MINE?

821
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,167
[baby crying]

822
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:28,167
>> [coughs]

823
00:26:32,933 --> 00:26:34,667
IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF A DEAL.

824
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:36,767
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU'RE MOVING OUT

825
00:26:36,767 --> 00:26:38,067
TOMORROW.

826
00:26:38,067 --> 00:26:40,500
>> BUT THE MONEY IS RIDICULOUS.

827
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,233
>> IT'S GONNA HAPPEN.

828
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:42,067
YOU GUYS ARE GONNA HAVE MONEY

829
00:26:42,067 --> 00:26:42,833
PROBLEMS PROBABLY THE REST OF

830
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:44,100
YOUR LIFE.

831
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:45,267
I MEAN, THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

832
00:26:45,267 --> 00:26:46,633
I HAVE NOT HEARD YOU TWO ARGUE

833
00:26:46,633 --> 00:26:48,100
UNTIL THIS DAMN MONEY CAME INTO

834
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,067
POSITION.

835
00:26:49,067 --> 00:26:50,900
MONEY, MONEY, MONEY, MONEY.

836
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,433
>> I'M NOT GONNA SIT HERE AND GO

837
00:26:52,433 --> 00:26:53,767
AGAINST YOU AND YOUR MOM.

838
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:54,567
I'M NOT DOING THAT.

839
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:55,233
THAT'S NOT FAIR.

840
00:26:55,233 --> 00:26:56,433
>> FORGET YOU.

841
00:26:56,433 --> 00:26:57,533
I'M TRYING TO GET YOU GUYS TO

842
00:26:57,533 --> 00:26:58,900
COMPROMISE, BECAUSE IT'S CRAZY

843
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,067
STUFF THAT'S OVER MONEY.

844
00:27:00,067 --> 00:27:01,100
>> AND HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE I

845
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,233
TOLD THIS AS MUCH MONEY AS I

846
00:27:02,233 --> 00:27:03,367
SPEND IN TRAFFIC TICKETS, I

847
00:27:03,367 --> 00:27:04,667
COULD HAVE BOUGHT A NEW CAR

848
00:27:04,667 --> 00:27:05,733
WITH, SOMETHING NICER THAN I

849
00:27:05,733 --> 00:27:07,100
HAVE?

850
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:07,933
YOU DON'T THINK I KNOW THIS

851
00:27:07,933 --> 00:27:08,467
[bleep].

852
00:27:08,467 --> 00:27:09,300
I DON'T NEED A SECOND MAMA.

853
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,467
I NEED A GIRLFRIEND, A MOTHER OF

854
00:27:10,467 --> 00:27:11,933
MY CHILDREN, NOT OF ME.

855
00:27:11,933 --> 00:27:13,067
>> EXACTLY, A MOTHER OF YOUR

856
00:27:13,067 --> 00:27:13,700
CHILDREN.

857
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,967
THIS MONEY COULD HAVE BEEN SPENT

858
00:27:14,967 --> 00:27:18,667
ON OUR KIDS.

859
00:27:18,667 --> 00:27:19,867
SO YOU'RE GONNA SIT THERE AND

860
00:27:19,867 --> 00:27:21,600
TELL ME THAT YOU WEREN'T MAD

861
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,767
WHENEVER YOU FOUND OUT THAT

862
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:23,900
DOLLAR AMOUNT?

863
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:25,067
>> BUT I DIDN'T TAKE IT OUT ON

864
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:26,567
YOU.

865
00:27:26,567 --> 00:27:27,633
>> YOU DIDN'T TAKE IT OUT ON ME,

866
00:27:27,633 --> 00:27:28,533
'CAUSE I DIDN'T GET THE

867
00:27:28,533 --> 00:27:31,067
MOTHER[bleep] TICKETS.

868
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:32,800
SORRY, THAT'S THE WAY THE COOKIE

869
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,600
CRUMBLES.

870
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:35,400
>> I'M TIRED OF GOING IN

871
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,200
CIRCLES.

872
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:38,067
>> I DON'T KNOW.

873
00:27:38,067 --> 00:27:39,333
I DON'T THINK I CAN LIVE HERE

874
00:27:39,333 --> 00:27:40,833
ANYMORE.

875
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:41,667
I'M LEAVING.

876
00:27:41,667 --> 00:27:42,500
>> BYE.

877
00:27:42,500 --> 00:27:43,567
PEYTON'S STAYING HERE.

878
00:27:43,567 --> 00:27:44,233
>> NO, SHE'S NOT.

879
00:27:44,233 --> 00:27:45,867
>> YES, SHE IS.

880
00:27:45,867 --> 00:27:46,900
YOU BETTER GO AND FIND YOU

881
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:47,767
SOMETHING TO DO AND COOL YOUR

882
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:48,467
[bleep] HEAD.

883
00:27:48,467 --> 00:27:50,367
I'M KEEPING MY DAUGHTER.

884
00:27:50,367 --> 00:27:51,933
SHE'S NOT GOING NOWHERE.

885
00:27:51,933 --> 00:27:54,067
>> SHE CAME OUT OF MY VAGINA--

886
00:27:54,067 --> 00:27:54,867
>> YEAH, AND GUESS WHO PUT HER

887
00:27:54,867 --> 00:27:55,533
IN THERE.

888
00:27:55,533 --> 00:27:56,300
THIS GUY.

889
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,133
>> WE'RE NOT GONNA DO THIS,

890
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:57,967
OKAY?

891
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,567
YOU CANNOT JUST WALK OUT AND

892
00:27:59,567 --> 00:28:01,200
EXPECT TO LEAVE AND TAKE HIS KID

893
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:01,967
AWAY FROM HIM.

894
00:28:01,967 --> 00:28:03,533
>> SHE'S BREAST-FED, THOUGH.

895
00:28:03,533 --> 00:28:04,267
>> IT DOESN'T MATTER.

896
00:28:04,267 --> 00:28:05,267
YOU BOTTLE-FEED HER ALL THE

897
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:05,933
TIME.

898
00:28:05,933 --> 00:28:07,067
YOU DON'T EVEN BREAST-FEED HALF

899
00:28:07,067 --> 00:28:07,733
THE TIME.

900
00:28:07,733 --> 00:28:08,467
>> YES, I DO.

901
00:28:08,467 --> 00:28:09,733
>> MOM, I GOT THIS.

902
00:28:09,733 --> 00:28:11,067
>> NO, BECAUSE THIS AIN'T GONNA

903
00:28:11,067 --> 00:28:12,067
TURN INTO NO [bleep]

904
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:13,067
FREE-FOR-ALL BECAUSE OVER

905
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:13,967
SOMETHING STUPID.

906
00:28:13,967 --> 00:28:14,967
>> AIN'T GONNA [bleep] BEG HER

907
00:28:14,967 --> 00:28:15,633
TO STAY.

908
00:28:15,633 --> 00:28:17,100
>> I GUESS YOU CAN KEEP HER FOR

909
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:19,467
TONIGHT, BUT I BETTER GET HER

910
00:28:19,467 --> 00:28:21,467
BACK TOMORROW.

911
00:28:25,433 --> 00:28:27,433
UGH.

912
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:36,300
ME AND SHAWN GOT INTO IT.

913
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:38,067
SO I STARTED PACKING MINE AND

914
00:28:38,067 --> 00:28:39,600
PEYTON'S STUFF, AND HE WAS LIKE,

915
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,567
"I HOPE YOU DON'T THINK YOU'RE

916
00:28:40,567 --> 00:28:41,700
TAKING PEYTON."

917
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:42,967
AND I SAID, "I HOPE YOU DON'T

918
00:28:42,967 --> 00:28:44,967
THINK YOU'RE KEEPING HER."

919
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,600
>> EVEN THOUGH MY MOM SAYS I

920
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,567
SHOULD TAKE PEYTON WITH ME,

921
00:29:14,567 --> 00:29:16,167
I'M TOO EXHAUSTED TO CONTINUE

922
00:29:16,167 --> 00:29:18,833
FIGHTING ABOUT IT.

923
00:29:18,833 --> 00:29:20,633
HI, MOM.

924
00:29:20,633 --> 00:29:22,233
>> HOW YOU DOING?

925
00:29:22,233 --> 00:29:24,667
>> UGH.

926
00:29:24,667 --> 00:29:29,333
IT STARTED OFF ABOUT MONEY,

927
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:32,900
WHICH ALTOGETHER, IT'S 2,500

928
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,900
IN COURT FEES.

929
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:36,533
>> WOW, $2,500.

930
00:29:36,533 --> 00:29:38,933
THAT'S PRETTY SIGNIFICANT.

931
00:29:38,933 --> 00:29:40,700
I MEAN, WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG,

932
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:43,100
AND YOU DON'T HAVE ANY MONEY,

933
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:45,633
$2,500 IS NOT A PETTY THING TO

934
00:29:45,633 --> 00:29:46,667
ARGUE ABOUT.

935
00:29:46,667 --> 00:29:47,833

00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,467
FOR A MINUTE, OF COURSE?

998
00:32:17,067 --> 00:32:20,567
I FEEL BAD FOR BEING SO HARSH

999

IT'S A HANDFUL.

1005

I WANT TO GET OVER IT,

1120
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,467
BECAUSE I THINK THAT OUR FAMILY

1121
00:37:07,467 --> 00:37:09,167
IS MORE IMPORTANT

1122
00:37:09,167 --> 00:37:11,733
AND TRY TO MY BEST TO MOVE ON

1123
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:15,567
FROM IT AND

1124
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:17,867
JUST GRIT MY TEETH AND WATCH YOU

1125
00:37:17,867 --> 00:37:20,467
PAY IT, I GUESS.

1126
00:37:20,467 --> 00:37:21,867
>> WHY YOU SQUIRMING, MAMA?

1127
00:37:21,867 --> 00:37:23,267
WHAT ARE YOU KICKING AT?

1128
00:37:23,267 --> 00:37:25,567
WHAT ARE YOU KICKING AT?

1129
00:37:25,567 --> 00:37:28,067
>> SO HERE'S THE PLAN.

1130
00:37:28,067 --> 00:37:30,133
I'M GONNA LIVE HERE WITH PEYTON.

1131
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:38,133
>> I DON'T LIKE BEING AWAY FROM

1132
00:37:38,133 --> 00:37:43,233
YOU OR HER.

1133
00:37:43,233 --> 00:37:44,500
BECAUSE I DON'T WANT HER TO BE

1134
00:37:44,500 --> 00:37:45,800
RAISED WITHOUT YOU.

1135
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,067
AND I DON'T LIKE SPENDING TIME

1136
00:37:48,067 --> 00:37:50,367
AWAY FROM YOU EITHER.

1137
00:37:50,367 --> 00:37:51,667
AND I'M ABOUT TO START SCHOOL

1138
00:37:51,667 --> 00:37:53,767
TOO.

1139
00:37:53,767 --> 00:37:55,367
WILL YOU COME HERE AND WATCH THE

1140
00:37:55,367 --> 00:37:56,833
KIDS THE DAYS THAT I HAVE

1141
00:37:56,833 --> 00:37:58,733
SCHOOL?

1142
00:37:58,733 --> 00:38:00,800
>> YEAH.

1143
00:38:12,067 --> 00:38:14,467
>> IT'S GONNA BE HARD, AND IT'S

1144
00:38:14,467 --> 00:38:16,267
NOT WHAT EITHER OF US WANTED,

1145
00:38:16,267 --> 00:38:18,467
BUT I THINK THAT THIS EVENT

1146
00:38:18,467 --> 00:38:19,867
KIND OF PUT A FIRE UNDER OUR

1147
00:38:19,867 --> 00:38:22,567
ASS TO GET OUR OWN PLACE.

1148
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:24,833
AND EVEN IF WE'RE NOT HAPPY,

1149
00:38:24,833 --> 00:38:26,633
WE AREN'T ALLOWED TO JUST THROW

1150
00:38:26,633 --> 00:38:28,900
IN THE TOWEL ANYMORE,

1151
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,267
BECAUSE WE HAVE KIDS.

1152
00:38:32,267 --> 00:38:36,800
>> *DON'T TELL ME THE TRUTH *

1153
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:41,133
* TELL ME THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN *

1154
00:38:41,133 --> 00:38:45,400
*THERE'S BEEN A MISTAKE *

1155
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:52,200
* THERE'S BEEN A MISUNDERSTAND *

1156
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,500
>> WHEN I PICTURED MY LIFE AFTER

1157
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:56,500
I HAD PEYTON, THIS IS NOT HOW I

1158
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,633
PICTURED IT AT ALL.

1159
00:39:00,633 --> 00:39:04,567
SHAWN AND I ARE STILL TOGETHER.

1160
00:39:04,567 --> 00:39:05,900
I THINK THAT WE'RE BOTH TRYING

1161
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,967
TO MAKE THINGS WORK FOR THE

1162
00:39:07,967 --> 00:39:09,100
KIDS.

1163
00:39:09,100 --> 00:39:11,333
[baby crying]

1164
00:39:11,333 --> 00:39:14,433
DON'T YOU START WITH ME.

1165
00:39:14,433 --> 00:39:16,600
I WISH THAT THINGS WERE EASIER

1166
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:19,733
FOR US TO BE TOGETHER AND EASIER

1167
00:39:19,733 --> 00:39:22,167
FOR US TO BE HAPPY.

1168
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:25,100
I WANT US TO BE ABLE TO PUT ALL

1169
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,767
OF OUR MONEY AND ALL OF OUR

1170
00:39:26,767 --> 00:39:28,400
RESOURCES INTO FINDING OUR

1171
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,700
OWN PLACE AND TO DOING

1172
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:32,333
THINGS WITH OUR KIDS,

1173
00:39:32,333 --> 00:39:34,400
BUT INSTEAD, THEY'RE GOING

1174
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,800
TO COURTS.

1175
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,800
I THINK MY GREATEST CHALLENGE IS

1176
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,767
GOING TO BE FINDING THE TIME TO

1177
00:39:39,767 --> 00:39:42,500
FINISH SCHOOL AND TAKE CARE OF

1178
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,733
BOTH KIDS.

1179
00:39:44,733 --> 00:39:47,967
IT'S A LOT, AND WHEN I THOUGHT

1180
00:39:47,967 --> 00:39:49,900
ABOUT MYSELF GOING TO COLLEGE,

1181
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:52,933
I FIGURED I'D BE LIVING ON

1182
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:55,067
CAMPUS, I WOULD BE

1183
00:39:55,067 --> 00:39:58,367
PARTY-HOPPING, BUT I DON'T

1184
00:39:58,367 --> 00:39:59,733
REALLY HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY

1185
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:02,767
ANYMORE.

1186
00:40:02,767 --> 00:40:03,867
I LOVE YOU.

1187
00:40:03,867 --> 00:40:05,600
I FEEL LIKE MY KIDS DESERVE

1188
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,867
SO MUCH MORE THAN I CAN GIVE

1189
00:40:07,867 --> 00:40:11,867
THEM, AND THAT HURTS.

1190
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:14,067
I--I DEFINITELY WANT BETTER FOR

1191
00:40:14,067 --> 00:40:14,800
THEM.

1192
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,267
I WISH I WOULD HAVE WAITED

1193
00:40:18,267 --> 00:40:20,233
UNTIL I HAD THINGS TOGETHER.

1194
00:40:20,233 --> 00:40:20,900
[chime dings]

1195
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:23,767
>> *I'M NOT AFRAID *

1196
00:40:23,767 --> 00:40:25,567
* TEARING YOUR HEART

1197
00:40:25,567 --> 00:40:29,467
*INTO PIECES *

1198
00:40:29,467 --> 00:40:33,167
*

1199
00:40:39,667 --> 00:40:40,633
>> I JUST HOPE THAT HE HAS

1200
00:40:40,633 --> 00:40:41,833
ENOUGH TIME WITH HER, THE TIME

1201
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:42,833
THAT HE WANTS, THE TIME THAT HE

1202
00:40:42,833 --> 00:40:43,600
NEEDS.

1203
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,867
>> JUST SO WE CLEAR, NO

1204
00:40:44,867 --> 00:40:46,200
VISITATION WHEN THERE'S NO

1205
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:47,100
ADULTS HERE.

1206
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,433
>> IT'S BEEN HARD MIXING OUR

1207
00:40:48,433 --> 00:40:49,833
DIFFERENT SCHEDULES AND GETTING

1208
00:40:49,833 --> 00:40:51,267
HIM TIME TO SPEND WITH LAYLA.

1209
00:40:51,267 --> 00:40:52,167
>> AND THAT'S PISSING ME OFF AND

1210
00:40:52,167 --> 00:40:53,100
IRRITATING ME.

1211
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,400
>> WHAT YOU WANT TO DO IS

1212
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:55,300
REMEMBER YOUR IRRITATION IS

1213
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,300
SITTING IN MY HOUSE.
