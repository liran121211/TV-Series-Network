WE SHOULD GO TO THE PUMPKIN

00:00:07,775 --> 00:00:08,542
>> YAY!

00:00:08,542 --> 00:00:09,843
>> YAY, S'MORES.

7
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:12,413
I LIVE IN HAYDEN, ALABAMA, WITH

8
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:15,049
MY DAD AND MY STEPMOM.

THE WORLD TO MAKE SURE YOU'LL BE

11
00:00:17,485 --> 00:00:18,419
ALL RIGHT.

[school bell rings]

13
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,288

STUDENT.

15
00:00:21,155 --> 00:00:22,323
BALANCING HIGH SCHOOL DRAMA

16
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:23,691
AND ACCELERATED COURSES IS

17
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:24,925
A PIECE OF CAKE.

18
00:00:24,925 --> 00:00:25,793
>> THEY KNOW THAT SHE'S GOT

19
00:00:25,793 --> 00:00:26,694
STRAIGHT "A"s.

20
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:28,629
I'M ALSO A MAJORETTE IN THE HIGH

22
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:32,466
THAT'S HOW I MET DANIEL.

23
00:00:32,466 --> 00:00:34,368
HE PLAYS TENOR SAXOPHONE.

24
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:35,669
WE'VE BEEN TOGETHER FOR OVER A

25
00:00:35,669 --> 00:00:37,405
YEAR NOW, AND WE'RE ENGAGED TO

26
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:38,872
BE MARRIED IN JUNE.

27
00:00:38,872 --> 00:00:40,641
ALABAMA'S GREAT, BUT I'M READY

28
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:41,809
TO GO TO COLLEGE.

29
00:00:41,809 --> 00:00:42,743
THAT'S WHERE I'LL STUDY TO

30
00:00:42,743 --> 00:00:44,345
BECOME A PHARMACIST.

31
00:00:44,345 --> 00:00:45,479
BEING A TEENAGER HAS BEEN PRETTY

32
00:00:45,479 --> 00:00:47,181
EASY SO FAR.

33
00:00:47,181 --> 00:00:48,282
I'VE HAD A LOT OF SUPPORT FROM

34
00:00:48,282 --> 00:00:49,783
MY FRIENDS AND FAMILY.

36
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:51,819
LOOK AT ALL THAT.

37
00:00:51,819 --> 00:00:53,321
YOU ARE, LIKE, THE TOP OF THE

38
00:00:53,321 --> 00:00:53,987
CLASS.

39
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:55,489
>> BUT THAT'S ALL ABOUT TO

40
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:57,491
CHANGE, BECAUSE...

00:00:57,491 --> 00:00:59,427

BUT WHEN I GOT PREGNANT, I MOVED

46
00:01:10,938 --> 00:01:12,806
OUT OF HER HOUSE.

47
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:15,309
IT REALLY HURTS KNOWING I DON'T

48
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:17,211
HAVE HER SUPPORT.

[door slams]

50
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:19,079
I HAD TO CHANGE HIGH SCHOOLS AND

51
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,414
MOVE INTO MY DAD'S HOUSE AN HOUR

52
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,316
AWAY TO THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE.

53
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:23,551
WHOA!

54
00:01:23,551 --> 00:01:24,718
I REALLY WISH I DIDN'T HAVE TO

55
00:01:24,718 --> 00:01:26,420
LEAVE MY BAND FRIENDS.

56
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,755
I PROBABLY WON'T BE ABLE TO HANG

57
00:01:27,755 --> 00:01:28,689
OUT WITH THEM AS MUCH

58
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:29,623
AS I USED TO.

60
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:31,759
>> DO YOU MISS, LIKE, BEING OUT

61
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,026
WITH THE BAND AND EVERYTHING?

62
00:01:33,026 --> 00:01:34,128
>> I MEAN, YEAH, I MISS, LIKE,

63
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:36,330
PERFORMING, JUST BECAUSE I THREW

64
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,698
BATON FOR, LIKE, NINE YEARS.

65
00:01:37,698 --> 00:01:40,334
SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE, "MAN, I

66
00:01:40,334 --> 00:01:41,702
WISH I COULD STILL BE OUT THERE,

67
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:44,838
JUST ATTENTION ON ME.

69
00:01:46,174 --> 00:01:48,809
AND IT'S LIKE, WELL, YOU KNOW,

70
00:01:48,809 --> 00:01:49,943
TO SEE ANYBODY, IT HAS TO BE,

71
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,380
LIKE, 45 MINUTES, SO--

72
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,347
>> SO WHEN YOUR MOM FOUND OUT

73
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:54,215
YOU WERE PREGNANT, LIKE, HOW DID

74
00:01:54,215 --> 00:01:54,848
SHE REACT?

75
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,717
>> DEFINITELY SHOCKED AND ANGRY.

76
00:01:56,717 --> 00:01:59,820
AND SHE SAID I WAS NOT ALLOWED

77
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,689
TO LIVE UNDER HER ROOF PREGNANT.

78
00:02:01,689 --> 00:02:02,623
>> WHY?

79
00:02:02,623 --> 00:02:03,524
>> SHE DIDN'T EVEN CARE WHERE

80
00:02:03,524 --> 00:02:04,124
YOU WENT?

81
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:04,792
>> MM-MMM.

82
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:05,693
AS LONG AS I WASN'T LIVING AT

83
00:02:05,693 --> 00:02:06,694
HER HOUSE.

84
00:02:06,694 --> 00:02:07,728
>> DID YOUR DAD TAKE IT EASIER

85
00:02:07,728 --> 00:02:08,529
THAN YOUR MOM?

86
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:11,299
>> UM, I THINK MY DAD, HE HAD

87
00:02:11,299 --> 00:02:11,999
TALKED TO ME.

88
00:02:11,999 --> 00:02:12,833
"BE SAFE.

89
00:02:12,833 --> 00:02:13,667
THAT'S ALL I CARE ABOUT.

90
00:02:13,667 --> 00:02:14,868
DON'T GET PREGNANT.

91
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:15,703
MAKE GOOD GRADES."

92
00:02:15,703 --> 00:02:18,972
SO OUT OF THREE RULES, I BROKE,

93
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,574
LIKE, THE MAIN ONE, YOU KNOW?

94
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:21,609
[laughter]

95
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:23,877
SO I KIND OF FELT LIKE I WAS

96
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:24,812
DISAPPOINTING HIM.

97
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:26,380
DISAPPOINTED IS AN

98
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,948
UNDERSTATEMENT.

99
00:02:27,948 --> 00:02:29,950
MY DAD WAS READY TO KILL ME, BUT

100
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,051
HE KNOWS I DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE

101
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:34,788
ELSE TO GO RIGHT NOW.

102
00:02:34,788 --> 00:02:35,923
>> I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU.

103
00:02:35,923 --> 00:02:37,758
I HAD TO HAVE A TEST.

104
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:38,926
>> MMM-HMM.

105
00:02:38,926 --> 00:02:40,594
>> AND THEN ONCE I GOT THAT, YOU

106
00:02:40,594 --> 00:02:42,563
KNOW, I WAS OKAY FOR A LITTLE

107
00:02:42,563 --> 00:02:45,199
WHILE, BUT THEN THE ANGER SET IN

108
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:47,235
AND ALL THE EMOTIONS WADDED UP

109
00:02:47,235 --> 00:02:48,736
AND I THOUGHT I WANTED TO

110
00:02:48,736 --> 00:02:49,670
STRANGLE YOU.

111
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,472
YOU KNOW?

112
00:02:51,472 --> 00:02:52,773
AND THEN THE FIRST THING THAT

113
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:53,607
WENT THROUGH MY MIND WAS

114
00:02:53,607 --> 00:02:54,542
ABORTION.

115
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:55,843
I MEAN, THIS COULD HELP YOU.

116
00:02:55,843 --> 00:02:56,944
>> I THINK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

117
00:02:56,944 --> 00:02:58,178
THE EASIEST THING TO DO, YOU

118
00:02:58,178 --> 00:02:59,780
KNOW, NOT HAVING TO SPEND ANY

119
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,082
MONEY, BUT I, LIKE, LOOKED IT UP

120
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:03,617
ON THE COMPUTER, AND I DECIDED

121
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:05,419
THAT THAT WAS WRONG AND STUFF.

122
00:03:05,419 --> 00:03:06,320
>> DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU'RE

123
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,355
MATURE ENOUGH TO HAVE MADE THE

124
00:03:07,355 --> 00:03:09,290
DECISION TO HAVE A BABY?

125
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,524
>> YEAH.

126
00:03:10,524 --> 00:03:11,859
I GUESS.

127
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:12,793
[laughs]

128
00:03:12,793 --> 00:03:13,794
>> DO YOU SERIOUSLY FEEL LIKE--

129
00:03:13,794 --> 00:03:15,329
THAT YOU'RE, IN YOUR BRAIN--

130
00:03:15,329 --> 00:03:16,597
>> WELL, I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE

131
00:03:16,597 --> 00:03:17,298
NOW.

132
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:18,432
>> WELL, THERE'S STILL A LOT OF

133
00:03:18,432 --> 00:03:19,800
THINGS THAT BOTHER ME, MAYBE

134
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,402
WHERE I MESSED UP AT.

135
00:03:21,402 --> 00:03:22,736
YOU KNOW, WHAT, DID I TELL YOU

136
00:03:22,736 --> 00:03:24,372
IT WAS OKAY TO HAVE SEX?

137
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:25,506
>> MM-MMM.

138
00:03:25,506 --> 00:03:27,641
>> WELL, YOU PROBABLY KNEW THAT

139
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:29,209
HAVING PREMARITAL SEX WASN'T

140
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,478
RIGHT.

141
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:31,945
I MEAN, IT JUST HAPPENED IN THE

142
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:32,813
MOMENT, RIGHT?

143
00:03:32,813 --> 00:03:34,114
>> NO, I MEAN, I KNEW IT WASN'T

144
00:03:34,114 --> 00:03:35,783
RIGHT, BUT IT'S NOT--

145
00:03:35,783 --> 00:03:38,952
I DON'T KNOW.

146
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:39,887
>> IT'S GONNA TAKE ME A WHILE TO

147
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:41,822
ACCEPT DANIEL, BECAUSE I REALLY

148
00:03:41,822 --> 00:03:43,324
DON'T KNOW HIM AS WELL AS YOU.

149
00:03:43,324 --> 00:03:44,325
I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW EACH

150
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:44,992
OTHER.

151
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:47,895
BUT AFTER TIME, I'LL GET USED TO

152
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:50,631
JOHNNY BRAVO, I GUESS.

153
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:52,900
>> HOPEFULLY.

154
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:57,971
EVEN THOUGH I MOVED AN HOUR AWAY

155
00:03:57,971 --> 00:03:59,540
FROM HOOVER, MY BOYFRIEND,

156
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:00,641
DANIEL, STILL COMES TO VISIT

157
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:01,942
EVERY WEEKEND.

158
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:03,644
IT REALLY MEANS A LOT TO ME,

159
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,078
SINCE I ONLY SEE HIM FOR A FEW

160
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,280
DAYS EACH WEEK.

161
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,615
WHAT DID YOU THINK

162
00:04:07,615 --> 00:04:09,283
WHEN I TOLD YOU?

163
00:04:09,283 --> 00:04:09,983
>> I DON'T KNOW.

164
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:10,751
I DIDN'T BELIEVE YOU.

165
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:12,786
>> YEAH, WHAT MADE YOU END UP

166
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:13,754
BELIEVING ME?

167
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,356
>> 'CAUSE YOU TOLD ME A BUNCH OF

168
00:04:15,356 --> 00:04:16,790
TIMES.

169
00:04:16,790 --> 00:04:17,791
>> DID YOU NOT WANT TO BELIEVE

170
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:18,759
ME, OR DID YOU JUST--

171
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,493
>> NO, I DIDN'T WANT

172
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:20,160
TO BELIEVE YOU.

173
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,563
>> WELL...

174
00:04:22,563 --> 00:04:24,498
>> I DIDN'T WANT NO BABY.

175
00:04:24,498 --> 00:04:26,133
I MEAN, I DO NOW, I GUESS,

176
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:26,800
BUT...

177
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,701
>> YEAH.

178
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:29,136
I THINK WE'LL LIKE THIS CHOICE.

179
00:04:29,136 --> 00:04:32,306
>> I HOPE SO.

180
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:34,608
I MEAN, I LIKE YOU.

181
00:04:42,816 --> 00:04:44,217
>> I'VE BEEN GOING TO THE LOCAL

182
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:45,453
HIGH SCHOOL FOR A COUPLE OF

183
00:04:45,453 --> 00:04:46,420
MONTHS NOW.

184
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:47,888
IT WAS TOUGH LEAVING MY OLD

185
00:04:47,888 --> 00:04:49,222
SCHOOL BEHIND AND ESPECIALLY MY

186
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,157
FRIENDS.

187
00:04:50,157 --> 00:04:51,659
I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO MAKE MANY

188
00:04:51,659 --> 00:04:53,927
NEW ONES YET, AND I DON'T LIKE

189
00:04:53,927 --> 00:04:56,063
BEING ISOLATED, SO I STILL TRY

190
00:04:56,063 --> 00:04:57,331
TO VISIT MY OLD FRIENDS

191
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:58,599
WHEN I CAN.

192
00:04:58,599 --> 00:04:59,900
EVERYBODY GETS A POKER.

193
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,268
>> ALL RIGHT, GRAB YOUR WIENERS.

194
00:05:01,268 --> 00:05:02,770
[laughter]

195
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,604
>> GRAB YOUR WIENERS.

196
00:05:03,604 --> 00:05:05,072
>> SO WHAT'S, LIKE, Y'ALL'S

197
00:05:05,072 --> 00:05:05,873
GAME PLAN?

198
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:07,274
>> POOP THE BABY OUT...

199
00:05:07,274 --> 00:05:08,409
>> [laughs]

200
00:05:08,409 --> 00:05:10,644
>> WELL, I GUESS, BEFORE THAT,

201
00:05:10,644 --> 00:05:12,279
SAVE UP MONEY, AND THEN I'M

202
00:05:12,279 --> 00:05:13,847
GOING TO U AT HUNTSVILLE.

203
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:17,117
AND MAJOR IN AERONAUTICAL AND

205
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,687
>> NICE.

206
00:05:19,687 --> 00:05:20,354
>> GOOD MAJOR.

207
00:05:20,354 --> 00:05:21,288
>> IT'S JUST A FANCY NAME.

208
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:22,423
>> IT'S JUST A FANCY NAME.

209
00:05:22,423 --> 00:05:24,458
>> SO ARE YOU GONNA LIVE OUT

210
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,158
THERE?

211
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,461
>> YEAH.

212
00:05:27,461 --> 00:05:30,197
>> HECK, YEAH, SHE IS.

213
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:32,232
DUH.

214
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:33,934
>> YEAH, ABOUT LIVING BY

215
00:05:33,934 --> 00:05:35,403
OURSELVES.

216
00:05:35,403 --> 00:05:37,337
>> I'M NOT AS NERVOUS.

217
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:40,841
>> AND JUST DOING EVERYTHING ON

218
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:42,042
OUR OWN.

219
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:43,511
IT'S GOING TO BE TOUGH, BUT OUR

220
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:45,312
PLAN IS TO MOVE INTO COLLEGE

221
00:05:45,312 --> 00:05:46,447
HOUSING TOGETHER AT THE

222
00:05:46,447 --> 00:05:47,781
UNIVERSITY OF HUNTSVILLE ONCE

223
00:05:47,781 --> 00:05:50,117
DANIEL AND I FINISH HIGH SCHOOL.

224
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:51,752
DANIEL IS A GRADE AHEAD OF ME,

225
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:53,020
BUT I'M GOING TO TAKE SUMMER

226
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,755
CLASSES SO I CAN FINISH ALL MY

227
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:57,190
WORK IN TIME TO GRADUATE EARLY.

228
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,459
MY DOCTOR SAYS I'LL NEED ABOUT A

229
00:05:58,459 --> 00:06:00,327
MONTH TO RECOVER AFTER GIVING

230
00:06:00,327 --> 00:06:02,262
BIRTH, BUT MY HIGH SCHOOL POLICY

231
00:06:02,262 --> 00:06:04,598
ONLY ALLOWS TEN DAYS OF ABSENCES

232
00:06:04,598 --> 00:06:06,266
PER SEMESTER.

233
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:07,601
HOPEFULLY I CAN TAKE MORE TIME

234
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:08,902
THAN THAT, EVEN THOUGH I'VE

235
00:06:08,902 --> 00:06:10,270
ALREADY MISSED A BUNCH OF DAYS

236
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:12,139
DUE TO MORNING SICKNESS.

237
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,874
BUT THE NEXT DAY, MY STEPMOM,

240
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:16,977
>> LOOK AT THIS.

241
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:18,278
>> WHAT DOES IT SAY?

242
00:06:18,278 --> 00:06:19,647
>> "THE BOARD OF EDUCATION

243
00:06:19,647 --> 00:06:21,348

244
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:23,016

245
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:26,186
NUMBER OF DAYS ALLOWED, HE OR

246
00:06:26,186 --> 00:06:27,955
SHE MAY RECEIVE A GRADE OF 59,

247
00:06:27,955 --> 00:06:31,124
FAILURE DUE TO ATTENDANCE."

248
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,025
>> SO THEY'RE GONNA MAE A BIG

249
00:06:32,025 --> 00:06:32,960
DEAL OUT OF IT ALREADY, HUH?

250
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:33,627
>> MMM-HMM.

251
00:06:33,627 --> 00:06:35,028
>> THEY DON'T LIKE IT 'CAUSE

252
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:35,996
SHE'S PREGNANT.

253
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:37,631
>> THEY KNOW THAT SHE'S GOT

254
00:06:37,631 --> 00:06:40,300
STRAIGHT "A"s.

255
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,869
>> VALEDICTORIAN.

256
00:06:41,869 --> 00:06:42,836
>> WE CAN'T GET RID OF THE FACT

257
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,805
THAT SHE HAS MISSED A FEW DAYS

258
00:06:44,805 --> 00:06:48,041
THAT--OF BEING WHAT DO YOU CALL

259
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,176
IT--MORNING SICKNESS.

260
00:06:49,176 --> 00:06:50,544
I'D RATHER YOU STAY HOME THAN GO

261
00:06:50,544 --> 00:06:52,513
BARF ALL OVER HER DESK.

262
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:54,114
>> YEAH.

263
00:06:54,114 --> 00:06:55,449
>> I MEAN, I WOULD SIT THERE

264
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:56,917
MISERABLE ALL DAY ANYWAYS AND

265
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:58,351
NOT LEARN ANYTHING, SAME THING

266
00:06:58,351 --> 00:06:59,853
AS NOT BEING THERE.

267
00:06:59,853 --> 00:07:01,889
>> THIS COMMUNITY'S GONNA BE

268
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:03,256
KIND OF TOUGH.

269
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,157
>> THEY'RE NOT KIDDING AROUND

270
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:07,027
ANYMORE.

271
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:08,896
>> HOW ARE DANIEL AND I GOING TO

272
00:07:08,896 --> 00:07:10,564
GO OFF TO COLLEGE TOGETHER IF I

273
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:13,066
CAN'T EVEN GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL?

274
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,002
[wind whistling]

275
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:23,644
>> THE LETTER FROM MY HIGH

276
00:07:23,644 --> 00:07:24,745
SCHOOL MAKES ME WORRY ABOUT

277
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:26,313
GRADUATING ON TIME.

278
00:07:26,313 --> 00:07:27,481
I GUESS DANIEL AND I NEED TO

279
00:07:27,481 --> 00:07:29,550
START THINKING ABOUT OUR FUTURE.

280
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,350
>> SO WHAT WERE YOUR, LIKE,

281
00:07:30,350 --> 00:07:31,852
SCHOOL PLANS AND STUFF?

282
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:34,054
>> WELL, PROBABLY GO TO

283
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:36,023
U OF HUNTSVILLE.

284
00:07:36,023 --> 00:07:38,692
YOU BETTER BE LIVING WITH ME--

285
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:39,893
AND THEN IN MARRIED STUDENT

286
00:07:39,893 --> 00:07:41,294
HOUSING.

287
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,130
>> MY DAD REALLY DOESN'T THINK

288
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,800
THAT THAT'S AN OPTION, I GUESS.

289
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,935
>> HE'S GONNA HAVE TO GET

290
00:07:47,935 --> 00:07:49,269
OVER IT, 'CAUSE YOU'RE A BIG

00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,273
HIM, THOUGH.

294
00:07:53,273 --> 00:07:54,174
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE

295
00:07:54,174 --> 00:07:55,375
SUPPOSED TO SHOW HIM THAT.

296
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,344
>> YEAH.

297
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:58,478
WE DEFINITELY NEED TO GET

298
00:07:58,478 --> 00:07:59,747
MARRIED IN JUNE IF WE'RE GOING

299
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:01,114
TO LIVE TOGETHER IN STUDENT

300
00:08:01,114 --> 00:08:02,049
HOUSING.

301
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:03,383
>> YEAH, I THINK IT COULD

302
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:05,018
HAPPEN.

303
00:08:05,018 --> 00:08:06,019
>> YOU REALLY DO HAVE IT PLANNED

304
00:08:06,019 --> 00:08:06,754
OUT, THOUGH?

305
00:08:06,754 --> 00:08:07,955
>> YEAH, I PROMISE.

306
00:08:07,955 --> 00:08:09,256
I REALLY DO.

307
00:08:09,256 --> 00:08:10,624
>> I THINK IT WOULD BE KIND OF

308
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:12,259
WEIRD TO LIVE BY OURSELVES,

309
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:13,894
'CAUSE NEITHER OF US KNOW HOW TO

310
00:08:13,894 --> 00:08:14,862
TAKE CARE OF A BABY.

311
00:08:14,862 --> 00:08:17,164

00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:18,632
KICK IN, AND I'LL BE A GOOD

DADDY.

314
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:23,637
>> I HOPE SO.

>> CUTE.

324
00:08:35,415 --> 00:08:36,183
>> YES.

325
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:37,785
>> BUT, YEAH, SINCE YOU'VE,

326
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:38,986
LIKE, MOVED HERE, YOU'VE BEEN A

327
00:08:38,986 --> 00:08:39,920
LOT HAPPIER.

328
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,221
>> SHE REALLY HAS.

329
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:42,189
>> I CAN JUST TELL, BECAUSE IN,

00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:43,256
LIKE, HOOVER, IT WAS, LIKE, ONE

331
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,291
BAD THING AFTER ANOTHER WITH

332
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:45,492
YOUR MOM AND...

333
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:46,594
>> SHE WAS REALLY SET ON ME

334
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:48,128
GETTING, LIKE, THE ABORTION AND

335
00:08:48,128 --> 00:08:50,197
STUFF, AND WHEN I DIDN'T, UM,

336
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:52,666
YOU KNOW, SHE WAS JUST LIKE,

337
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:53,934
"IT'S GONNA BE HARD, AND YOU'RE

338
00:08:53,934 --> 00:08:56,436
NOT GONNA LIVE HERE IN MY HOUSE

339
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:57,838
PREGNANT, SO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE

340
00:08:57,838 --> 00:08:59,139
TO KEEP THE BABY AND GO LIVE

341
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:00,941
WHEREVER YOU CAN."

342
00:09:00,941 --> 00:09:02,710
>> "WHEREVER YOU CAN."

343
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:04,945
>> AND IF MY DAD WOULDN'T HAVE

344
00:09:04,945 --> 00:09:06,446
BEEN SUPPORTIVE, THEN ME AND

345
00:09:06,446 --> 00:09:08,315
DANIEL, WE WERE PROBABLY GONNA

346
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:09,449
HAVE TO MOVE OUT.

347
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:10,483
>> WHAT DO Y'ALL PLAN ON DOING,

348
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,620
LIKE, ONCE THE BABY COMES?

349
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,755
>> HE'S GOT IT ALL PLANNED OUT.

350
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:15,623
>> OH, I GOTCHA.

351
00:09:15,623 --> 00:09:17,190
>> HE'LL STILL HAVE TO FINISH

352
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,458
SCHOOL AND STUFF LIKE THAT, BUT

353
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:19,860
HE'LL DRIVE UP HERE, JUST LIKE

354
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:20,961
NORMAL.

355
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:22,696
>> WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

356
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:23,931
>> UM, ACTUALLY, I'M NOT SURE ON

357
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:24,998
IF YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT OUR SCHOOL

358
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:26,033
DRAMA, BUT...

359
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:26,800
>> WHAT HAPPENED?

360
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,936
>> UM, THEY'RE TRYING TO, LIKE,

361
00:09:28,936 --> 00:09:30,270
NOT LET ME BE ABLE TO GO TO

362
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,438
SCHOOL NEXT SEMESTER.

363
00:09:31,438 --> 00:09:32,372
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?

364
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:33,807
>> I ONLY GET TWO WEEKS OFF.

365
00:09:33,807 --> 00:09:34,808
>> THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

366
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:36,476
>> ONLY TWO WEEKS OFF?

367
00:09:36,476 --> 00:09:37,978
THEY'RE GONNA FAIL YOU JUST

368
00:09:37,978 --> 00:09:38,812
BECAUSE OF THAT?

369
00:09:38,812 --> 00:09:40,313
THAT'S--OHH...

370
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:43,016
>> I HOPE NOT.

371
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:44,685
ALL OF DANIEL'S PLANS ARE RIDING

372
00:09:44,685 --> 00:09:46,386
ON ME GRADUATING HIGH SCHOOL

373
00:09:46,386 --> 00:09:48,121
EARLY, BUT IF MY SCHOOL IS GOING

374
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:49,322
TO FAIL ME, WE MIGHT NEED TO

375
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,058
RECONSIDER.

376
00:09:51,058 --> 00:09:53,193
MY DAD WANTS TO MEET WITH

377
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:54,728
DANIEL'S PARENTS TO TALK ABOUT

378
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:57,698
MY SCHOOL SITUATION.

379
00:10:00,668 --> 00:10:01,735
>> HE'S BEEN ACCEPTED TO

380
00:10:01,735 --> 00:10:03,737
UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA

381
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:05,238
HUNTSVILLE, AND THEY WANT TO

382
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:06,940
GIVE HIM A SCHOLARSHIP.

383
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,776
AND I'M VERY PROUD OF HIM.

384
00:10:08,776 --> 00:10:11,812
RIGHT?

385
00:10:11,812 --> 00:10:12,680
>> HIM GOING TO COLLEGE RIGHT

386
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:14,547
NOW IS SOMETHING THAT, YOU KNOW,

387
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:15,482
PERSONALLY, I COULD CARE LESS

388
00:10:15,482 --> 00:10:16,149
ABOUT.

389
00:10:16,149 --> 00:10:17,818
WE'RE HAVING PROBLEMS JUST

390
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:18,719
GETTING EMILY THROUGH THE

391
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:20,954
11TH GRADE.

392
00:10:20,954 --> 00:10:21,989
WE REALIZED WHEN SHE MOVED OUT

393
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:23,123
HERE THAT THERE WAS GONNA BE

394
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:26,459
SOME...BUMPY ROADS, BUT I NEVER

395
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:27,795
THOUGHT THEY'D DO HER THAT WAY,

396
00:10:27,795 --> 00:10:29,629
AND SHE'S GOT STRAIGHT "A"s.

397
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,497
>> AWW...

398
00:10:30,497 --> 00:10:31,999
>> WELL, WHATEVER YOU WANT ME TO

399
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:33,200
DO--I'M NOT HER PARENTAL

400
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,501
GUARDIAN, BUT...

401
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:35,635
>> WE'RE NOT ASKING YOU TO BE,

402
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:37,938
BUT YOUR HELP AS FAR AS

403
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:39,773
SOMETHING TO GIVE US AN IDEA OF

404
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:40,540
WHAT WE COULD DO WOULD BE

405
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:41,174
AWESOME.

406
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:41,842
>> I SURE WILL.

407
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:43,010
I SURE WILL.

408
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,812
>> LUNCH WAS PRETTY AWKWARD, SO

409
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:46,246
WE'RE INVITING DANIEL'S PARENTS

410
00:10:46,246 --> 00:10:47,815
BACK TO MY DAD'S HOUSE TO SHOW

411
00:10:47,815 --> 00:10:48,882
THEM THE LETTER WE GOT FROM MY

412
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:52,652
HIGH SCHOOL.

413
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,987
>> "FAILURE DUE TO ATTENDANCE

414
00:10:53,987 --> 00:10:55,222
FOR THE SEMESTER."

415
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:57,958
I MEAN, I'M SURE THEY COULD WORK

416
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:58,759
WITH YOU.

417
00:10:58,759 --> 00:10:59,793
>> BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO

418
00:10:59,793 --> 00:11:01,762
MORE THAN JUST SIGN A LETTER.

419
00:11:01,762 --> 00:11:03,063
>> WELL, ONCE YOU GRADUATE FROM

420
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:05,665
HIGH SCHOOL, WHAT ARE YOUR

421
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:07,200
PLANS?

422
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,001
>> BE GOING TO SCHOOL TO

423
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:09,469
U AT HUNTSVILLE.

424
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:12,005
AND THEN I'LL BE WORKING TOO.

425
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:13,473
'CAUSE THE RENT'S NOT GONNA BE

426
00:11:13,473 --> 00:11:15,208
MUCH AT ALL.

427
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:16,443
>> ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT MARRIED

428
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:17,244
STUDENT HOUSING?

429
00:11:17,244 --> 00:11:17,911
>> YEAH.

430
00:11:17,911 --> 00:11:18,678
>> [clears throat]

431
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:19,579
>> HEY, THE KID IS SMART.

432
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:20,814
THAT'S GREAT AND WONDERFUL, BUT

433
00:11:20,814 --> 00:11:23,884
I CAN HAVE MY OPINION ON PUTTING

434
00:11:23,884 --> 00:11:25,085
A GOLDEN PATH DOWN FOR THIS

435
00:11:25,085 --> 00:11:26,453
BOY'S EDUCATION, AND MY GIRL'S

436
00:11:26,453 --> 00:11:28,956
GONNA BE WORKING AT THE LOCAL

439
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:31,691
>> OH, I HOPE NOT.

440
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,760
>> I HOPE NOT TOO.

441
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:33,727
>> IT REALLY DOESN'T MATTER WHAT

442
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:34,627
YOU THINK, THOUGH, BECAUSE

443
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:35,262
EVERYTHING--

444
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:36,663
>> I THINK IT DOES MATTER,

445
00:11:36,663 --> 00:11:38,631
BECAUSE I COULD STOP IT, PERIOD.

446
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:40,033
I CAN KEEP HER FROM EVEN

447
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:41,501
MARRYING YOU, PAL.

448
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:42,836
YOU HAVEN'T SHOWED ME ANYTHING

449
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:43,636
YET.

450
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,072
>> WHAT DO I NEED TO DO TO SHOW

451
00:11:45,072 --> 00:11:46,273
YOU THAT I AM A RESPONSIBLE

452
00:11:46,273 --> 00:11:47,640
PERSON?

453
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,109
I AM DOING EVERYTHING THAT I

454
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:51,478
HUMAN POSSIBLY CAN, AND YET

455
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:53,113
YOU'RE STILL NOT SATISFIED.

456
00:11:53,113 --> 00:11:54,314
>> MAYBE THAT'S JUST THE FATHER

457
00:11:54,314 --> 00:11:56,784
IN ME, I GUESS.

458
00:12:09,797 --> 00:12:12,866
[crickets chirping]

459
00:12:12,866 --> 00:12:14,301
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR

460
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:15,769
PARENTS THOUGHT?

461
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:17,004
>> THEY PROBABLY THINK YOUR

462
00:12:17,004 --> 00:12:18,471
DAD'S A JACKASS.

463
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,507
BUT I MEAN, THAT'S COOL.

464
00:12:20,507 --> 00:12:21,708
>> BUT I SEE WHERE EVERYBODY'S

465
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,111
COMING FROM.

466
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:26,446
>> IT'S HARD FOR HIM TO GIVE YOU

467
00:12:26,446 --> 00:12:28,882
UP TO ME.

468
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:29,850
BUT, YEAH, HE'S GONNA HAVE TO

469
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,551
GET OVER IT ONE DAY.

470
00:12:31,551 --> 00:12:34,321
>> YEAH.

471
00:12:37,024 --> 00:12:38,191
I HOPE MY DAD BECOMES MORE

472
00:12:38,191 --> 00:12:39,692
ACCEPTING OF DANIEL.

473
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:41,094
HE JUST WANTS ME TO FINISH HIGH

474
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:42,695
SCHOOL AND NOT FALL BEHIND ON MY

475
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:45,265
EDUCATION.

476
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:46,333
WHEN MY STEPMOM CALLED THE

477
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:47,700
SCHOOL TO SEE IF THEY WOULD GIVE

478
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,236
ME MORE THAN TWO WEEKS OFF AFTER

479
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:50,871
I DELIVER, SHE LEARNED THAT I

480
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:52,372
WAS GOING MISS TOO MANY DAYS TO

481
00:12:52,372 --> 00:12:54,141
PASS MY CLASSES.

482
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:55,242
DANIEL'S MOM WASN'T ABLE TO PULL

483
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:57,144
ANY STRINGS EITHER, SO MY DAD

484
00:12:57,144 --> 00:12:58,578
AND STEPMOM WITHDREW ME FROM

485
00:12:58,578 --> 00:12:59,913
SCHOOL THAT DAY.

486
00:12:59,913 --> 00:13:01,548
I WAS KIND OF SHOCKED.

487
00:13:01,548 --> 00:13:03,250
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THIS WAS ALL

488
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,584
GONNA HAPPEN TODAY.

489
00:13:04,584 --> 00:13:06,786
>> YEAH, WELL, I DIDN'T SEE ANY

490
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:07,855
REASON TO KEEP YOU THERE ONE

491
00:13:07,855 --> 00:13:09,990
MORE DAY, BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT

492
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,991
GONNA BUDGE.

493
00:13:10,991 --> 00:13:11,758
>> YEAH.

494
00:13:11,758 --> 00:13:13,126
>> I CALLED YOUR COUNSELOR AT

495
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,462
SCHOOL, AND SHE GAVE ME A LITTLE

496
00:13:15,462 --> 00:13:17,097
BIT MORE INFORMATION ON THE HOME

497
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:18,999
SCHOOLING, AND YOU NEED TO GO

498
00:13:18,999 --> 00:13:20,467
AHEAD AND GET STARTED SO THAT

499
00:13:20,467 --> 00:13:23,003
YOU COULD POSSIBLY GRADUATE

500
00:13:23,003 --> 00:13:25,405
EARLY AND THINGS CAN MOVE ON

501
00:13:25,405 --> 00:13:26,573
WITH YOU AND DANIEL.

502
00:13:26,573 --> 00:13:28,008
>> YEAH.

503
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:29,542
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT BEING

504
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:30,810
PREGNANT CAUSED ME TO BE

505
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,413
WITHDRAWN FROM HIGH SCHOOL.

506
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:34,447
I'VE ALREADY HAD TO SACRIFICE SO

507
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:36,549
MUCH: A RELATIONSHIP WITH MY

508
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,618
MOM, BEING WITH MY OLD FRIENDS,

509
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:40,087
AND NOW HIGH SCHOOL?

510
00:13:40,087 --> 00:13:41,821
I HOPE HOME SCHOOLING DOESN'T

511
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,490
SLOW DOWN MY PLANS OF MOVING IN

512
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:46,026
WITH DANIEL AFTER GRADUATION.

513
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,260
I'M REALLY ANXIOUS FOR HIM TO

514
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,461
GET HERE THIS WEEKEND SO I CAN

515
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:49,829
BRING HIM UP TO SPEED ON MY

516
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:51,164
SCHOOL SITUATION.

517
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:51,831
>> HI, BABY.

518
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,133
>> HI.

519
00:13:53,133 --> 00:13:54,334
I GOT WITHDRAWN TODAY, AND NOW

520
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,970
I'M GONNA BE HOME SCHOOLED.

521
00:13:58,438 --> 00:14:00,373
>> YEAH.

522
00:14:00,373 --> 00:14:01,608
WE'RE GONNA GO TOMORROW THERE

523
00:14:01,608 --> 00:14:03,543
FOR A MEETING.

524
00:14:05,979 --> 00:14:07,114
>> SO DO YOU THINK YOU'LL BE

525
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:09,049
ABLE TO COME OVER THIS WEEKEND?

526
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:12,652
>> WELL, I REALLY HOPE YOU CAN

527
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:13,353
COME BY SOON.

528
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,288
I MEAN...

529
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:17,657
>> I LOVE YOU.

530
00:14:17,657 --> 00:14:18,325
BYE.

531
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:20,060
I KNOW DANIEL HAS A BUSY

532
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,661
SCHEDULE, BETWEEN WORKING AND

533
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:23,530
FINISHING SCHOOL, BUT I STILL

534
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,697
WISH HE COULD COME OVER MORE

535
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:29,369
OFTEN.

536
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:30,637
SINCE MY DAD AND STEPMOM

537
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:32,539
WITHDREW ME FROM HIGH SCHOOL, MY

538
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,207
ONLY OPTION SEEMS TO BE HOME

539
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:35,875
SCHOOLING, SO I'M GOING TO MEET

540
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:37,244
WITH THE COUNSELOR TO SEE IF

541
00:14:37,244 --> 00:14:38,478
I'LL STILL BE ABLE TO GRADUATE

542
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:40,513
ON TIME.

543
00:14:40,513 --> 00:14:41,181
>> HI.

544
00:14:41,181 --> 00:14:43,450
HOW ARE YOU DOING TODAY?

545
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:46,486
TELL ME, WHY ARE YOU HERE TODAY?

546
00:14:46,486 --> 00:14:49,022
>> SHE IS PREGNANT, AND SHE'S

547
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,024
MISSING A LOT OF SCHOOL.

548
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:51,624
>> OKAY.

549
00:14:51,624 --> 00:14:52,859
>> AND WE WERE GONNA SEE IF IT

550
00:14:52,859 --> 00:14:54,694
WAS OKAY IF I COULD GRADUATE

551
00:14:54,694 --> 00:14:55,462
IN MAY.

552
00:14:55,462 --> 00:14:57,664
>> OKAY, IT IS POSSIBLE, BUT YOU

553
00:14:57,664 --> 00:14:59,499
WILL HAVE TO PUT IN A LOT OF

554
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,268
SCHOOL DAYS BY WORKING YOUR

555
00:15:01,268 --> 00:15:04,404
HOLIDAYS OR BY WORKING WEEKENDS.

556
00:15:04,404 --> 00:15:06,006
>> WHO, LIKE, MAKES SURE THAT I

557
00:15:06,006 --> 00:15:08,341
DO WORK AND THAT I DO COME?

558
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:11,611
>> YOU WILL REPORT TO ME EVERY

559
00:15:11,611 --> 00:15:12,745
NINE WEEKS.

560
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,014
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS LONG ENOUGH

561
00:15:14,014 --> 00:15:16,383
THAT I WILL BE ABLE TO TELL

562
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:18,885
IF YOU HAVE...

563
00:15:18,885 --> 00:15:19,752
>> DONE THE WORK.

564
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,188
>> IF YOU HAVE NOT, I ALWAYS

565
00:15:21,188 --> 00:15:24,357
HAVE THE OPTION OF DISMISSING

566
00:15:24,357 --> 00:15:25,292
A STUDENT.

567
00:15:25,292 --> 00:15:26,426
>> AND THEN EVEN WITH THE BABY

568
00:15:26,426 --> 00:15:28,328
BEING AT THE HOUSE, YOU STILL

569
00:15:28,328 --> 00:15:30,463
THINK I COULD WORK?

570
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:32,665
>> YOU CAN DO IT IF YOU WANT IT.

571
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,001
>> THAT'S THE PLAN, THEN.

572
00:15:34,001 --> 00:15:34,867
>> WELL, SIGN HER UP.

573
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,436
>> OKAY.

574
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,006
THIS WILL BE FOR YOUR ANATOMY.

575
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:39,672
>> OKAY.

576
00:15:39,672 --> 00:15:40,773
>> LITERATURE.

577
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:43,176
OKAY.

578
00:15:43,176 --> 00:15:46,246
MATH WILL BE USING BOOKLET FORM,

579
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:48,015
AND HISTORY WILL BE THE VERY

580
00:15:48,015 --> 00:15:52,752
SAME CURRICULUM.

581
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,421
>> OKAY.

582
00:15:54,421 --> 00:15:55,388
YOU'D THINK HOME SCHOOLING WOULD

583
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:56,423
HAVE LESS HOMEWORK THAN REGULAR

584
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:58,158
SCHOOL, BUT IT LOOKS LIKE IT

585
00:15:58,158 --> 00:16:01,128
MIGHT BE EVEN HARDER.

586
00:16:02,495 --> 00:16:04,231
BEFORE OUR JUNE WEDDING, I NEED

587
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:05,432
TO FINISH BOTH THE 11TH AND

588
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:07,234
12TH GRADE CURRICULUMS IF WE'RE

589
00:16:07,234 --> 00:16:08,535
GOING TO MOVE INTO MARRIED

590
00:16:08,535 --> 00:16:09,702
HOUSING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF

591
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,638
HUNTSVILLE NEXT SUMMER.

592
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:13,840
IT'S A LOT OF WORK, SO I'D

593
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:16,109
BETTER GET STARTED.

594
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,117
>> SO HOW'S LIFE BEEN SINCE THE

595
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:24,817
LAST TIME I SAW YOU?

596
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,019
>> GOOD, I GUESS.

597
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:27,020
HOW ARE YOUR EXAMS?

598
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,088
>> UGH...

599
00:16:28,088 --> 00:16:29,156
THE CLASSES ARE TOUGH.

600
00:16:29,156 --> 00:16:30,657
HOW ABOUT YOUR EXAMS?

601
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:31,724
>> I DON'T HAVE TO TAKE EXAMS

602
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:33,526
WITH THE HOME SCHOOL, SO...

603
00:16:33,526 --> 00:16:34,194
>> OH, YEAH.

604
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:35,095
I KEEP FORGETTING YOU'RE DOING

605
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:35,895
HOME SCHOOL.

606
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:36,563
>> MMM-HMM.

607
00:16:36,563 --> 00:16:38,431
>> SO DO YOU LIKE IT MORE, OR...

608
00:16:38,431 --> 00:16:41,501
>> UM, IT'S KIND OF, LIKE,

609
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:43,370
BORING NOT DOING ANYTHING ALL

610
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,905
DAY, BUT ALL I REALLY HAVE TO DO

611
00:16:45,905 --> 00:16:46,873
IS MY MATH.

612
00:16:46,873 --> 00:16:47,807
>> YOU'RE GOOD AT MATH, THOUGH.

613
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:50,343
>> YEAH, IT'S JUST HARD TO LEARN

614
00:16:50,343 --> 00:16:51,244
MYSELF.

615
00:16:51,244 --> 00:16:52,145
>> YEAH.

616
00:16:52,145 --> 00:16:53,313
SO WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON WITH YOU

617
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:54,247
AND DANIEL?

618
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:56,649
>> HE'S REAL BAD ABOUT, LIKE,

619
00:16:56,649 --> 00:16:58,351
UM, SAYING HE'S GONNA, LIKE,

620
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,886
COME OVER AND THEN, LIKE, NOT

621
00:16:59,886 --> 00:17:01,521
COMING OVER OR HAVING SOMETHING

622
00:17:01,521 --> 00:17:02,755
ALL OF A SUDDEN COMES UP TO

623
00:17:02,755 --> 00:17:04,657
WHERE HE DOESN'T EVER COME OVER.

624
00:17:04,657 --> 00:17:05,958
HE JUST HAS TO WORK A LOT.

625
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,727
>> THAT'S NOT COOL.

626
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:08,861
>> HE SAID HE'S GONNA TRY

627
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,430
HARDER, SO...

628
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:11,831
>> I KNOW LONG-DISTANCE

629
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:12,799
RELATIONSHIPS TAKE A LOT OF

630
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:14,167
WORK, BUT IT'S ESPECIALLY HARD

631
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:15,668
BEING PREGNANT AND NOT HAVING

632
00:17:15,668 --> 00:17:17,036
DANIEL AROUND.

633
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,538
IT'S HARDER TO BE AWAY FROM HIM

634
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:22,842
THAN I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE.

635
00:17:22,842 --> 00:17:24,177
SO I WAS GLAD HE DIDN'T CANCEL

636
00:17:24,177 --> 00:17:26,513
ON ME THE FOLLOWING WEEKEND.

637
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:30,983
I'M GLAD YOU COULD GET OFF.

638
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,785
>> YEAH, ME TOO.

639
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:33,520
I WANTED TO SEE YOU.

640
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,487
>> HOW COME YOU DIDN'T COME LAST

641
00:17:34,487 --> 00:17:35,688
WEEKEND?

642
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:37,857
>> WELL, I HAD TO WORK.

643
00:17:37,857 --> 00:17:39,692
>> I HOPE YOU'RE GONNA BE AROUND

644
00:17:39,692 --> 00:17:41,461
THE SAME OR A LITTLE BIT MORE

645
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:43,996
WHEN HE IS HERE,

646
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:44,997
JUST 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO TAKE

647
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,266
CARE OF HIM BY MYSELF.

648
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:48,835
>> I MEAN, I WOULDN'T EITHER.

649
00:17:48,835 --> 00:17:52,239
>> I KNOW YOU WOULDN'T.

650
00:17:52,239 --> 00:17:53,039
I GUESS WE'LL HAVE

651
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,674
TO WAIT AND SEE.

652
00:17:54,674 --> 00:17:55,608
>> YEAH.

653
00:17:55,608 --> 00:17:57,177
[swallows audibly]

654
00:17:57,177 --> 00:17:58,745
>> IT SEEMS THE CLOSER WE GET TO

655
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,113
MY DUE DATE, THE MORE I WORRY

656
00:18:00,113 --> 00:18:02,449
ABOUT HIS COMMITMENT.

657
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:06,153
IT'S STRANGE NOT SPENDING

658
00:18:06,153 --> 00:18:07,520
CHRISTMAS AT MY MOM'S HOUSE

659
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,289
THIS YEAR, BUT SOON ENOUGH, I'LL

660
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:10,557
BE ABLE TO CELEBRATE

661
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:12,192
WITH MY BABY.

662
00:18:12,192 --> 00:18:13,393
DANIEL WAS SUPPOSED TO COME OVER

663
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:14,961
TO HELP DECORATE THE TREE, BUT

664
00:18:14,961 --> 00:18:16,396
HE CALLED AND TOLD ME HE

665
00:18:16,396 --> 00:18:19,299
COULDN'T GET OFF WORK.

666
00:18:19,299 --> 00:18:20,367
>> JUST SAY ONE DAY THAT THAT

667
00:18:20,367 --> 00:18:23,203
BOY DOES HAVE THE NERVE TO MARRY

668
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:24,871
YOU OR SOMETHING, THAT WHAT

669
00:18:24,871 --> 00:18:25,638
YOU WANT?

670
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:27,340
>> YEAH, I GUESS.

671
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,408
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU GUESS?

672
00:18:28,408 --> 00:18:29,809
>> DO YOU FEEL LIKE YOU AND

673
00:18:29,809 --> 00:18:31,077
DANIEL ARE STILL GETTING TO KNOW

674
00:18:31,077 --> 00:18:31,844
EACH OTHER?

675
00:18:31,844 --> 00:18:32,979
IS THERE THINGS THAT DO BOTHER

676
00:18:32,979 --> 00:18:35,982
YOU ABOUT DANIEL THAT DIDN'T

677
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:37,384
BEFORE?

678
00:18:37,384 --> 00:18:38,185
>> WE KNOW EACH OTHER.

679
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:39,118
I MEAN, YOU CAN'T KNOW SOMEBODY

680
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,554
WELL ENOUGH IN A YEAR, ANYWAYS,

681
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:43,623
BUT I MEAN, YEAH, THERE'S STUFF

682
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:44,657
THAT BOTHERS ME.

683
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:45,992
[laughs]

684
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:47,694
HE GETS ON MY NERVES ALL THE

685
00:18:47,694 --> 00:18:50,330
TIME JUST BECAUSE HE'S DOING

686
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,165
SOMETHING, BUT I MEAN, IF IT

687
00:18:52,165 --> 00:18:53,132
DOESN'T WORK OUT AND WE CAN'T

688
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:54,301
GET ALONG, THEN WE WON'T HAVE TO

689
00:18:54,301 --> 00:18:56,269
GET MARRIED AND MOVE IN

690
00:18:56,269 --> 00:18:57,670
TOGETHER.

691
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,372
>> HMM.

692
00:18:59,372 --> 00:19:01,007
SO THAT WAY THAT SOUNDED IS, SHE

693
00:19:01,007 --> 00:19:02,209
WAS STILL ON THE SKEPTICAL SIDE

694
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:05,044
THAT...

695
00:19:05,044 --> 00:19:06,679
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE PLAYING

696
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,147
HOUSE FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS

697
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,682
AND JUST DO, LIKE, A TEST TRIAL.

698
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:13,620
THIS IS A COMMITMENT.

699
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:14,954
>> I UNDERSTAND.

700
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:18,491
>> DO YOU?

701
00:19:18,491 --> 00:19:19,626
>> IT'S NOT THAT I DON'T LOVE

702
00:19:19,626 --> 00:19:21,194
DANIEL ENOUGH TO GET MARRIED;

703
00:19:21,194 --> 00:19:22,094
I JUST HOPE HE'LL BE HERE TO

704
00:19:22,094 --> 00:19:24,697
SUPPORT ME AFTER THE BABY COMES.

705
00:19:33,973 --> 00:19:35,242
>> I'M PRETTY PREOCCUPIED

706
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:36,509
THINKING ABOUT THE BABY THESE

707
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,678
DAYS, SO I HAVE TO KEEP UP ON MY

708
00:19:38,678 --> 00:19:40,347
SCHOOLWORK SO I DON'T FALL

709
00:19:40,347 --> 00:19:41,681
BEHIND...

710
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,149
[bells chiming]

711
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:44,551
ESPECIALLY SINCE DANIEL AND I

712
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:46,052
PLAN TO GET MARRIED IN JUNE

713
00:19:46,052 --> 00:19:47,987
AFTER I FINISH THE 12TH GRADE.

714
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:54,261
A FEW DAYS BEFORE MY DUE DATE,

715
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:56,229
I WOKE UP WITH REALLY BAD PAIN.

716
00:19:56,229 --> 00:19:57,997
IT'S HAPPENING NOW.

717
00:19:57,997 --> 00:19:59,232
GUESS I'M GONNA CALL DANIEL

718
00:19:59,232 --> 00:19:59,932
REAL QUICK.

719
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:01,868
>> HI.

720
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:04,203
>> GOT TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL.

721
00:20:06,406 --> 00:20:07,640
>> THEY'RE, LIKE, TWO MINUTES

722
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,608
APART.

723
00:20:08,608 --> 00:20:09,276
I LOVE YOU.

724
00:20:09,276 --> 00:20:11,210
I'LL CALL YOU.

725
00:20:11,678 --> 00:20:14,281
>> OKAY, BYE.

726
00:20:14,281 --> 00:20:16,082
>> OKAY, AND IT JUST HAPPENED

727
00:20:16,082 --> 00:20:18,451
THEN.

728
00:20:18,451 --> 00:20:19,686
>> MY DAD IS AWAY ON BUSINESS

729
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:21,187
AND ISN'T ABLE TO COME BACK IN

730
00:20:21,187 --> 00:20:22,622
TIME FOR THE BIRTH, SO MY

731
00:20:22,622 --> 00:20:23,790
STEPMOM IS TAKING ME TO THE

732
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:26,293
HOSPITAL.

733
00:20:26,293 --> 00:20:27,660
EVEN THOUGH DANIEL HAD A LONG

734
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,262
DRIVE TO THE HOSPITAL, HE MADE

735
00:20:29,262 --> 00:20:31,898
IT AS SOON AS HE COULD.

736
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,400
AND IT MEANS A LOT TO ME THAT

737
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,935
HE'S HERE.

738
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:37,036
I WISH MY MOTHER WAS HERE

739
00:20:37,036 --> 00:20:37,704
WITH ME.

740
00:20:37,704 --> 00:20:39,205
I GUESS SHE'S STILL NOT READY TO

741
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:40,607
ACCEPT THIS YET.

742
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:41,874
[bleep], SORRY.

743
00:20:41,874 --> 00:20:43,476
MY CONTRACTIONS ARE GETTING

744
00:20:43,476 --> 00:20:44,577
STRONGER.

745
00:20:44,577 --> 00:20:45,912
>> I'M JUST GONNA SWAB YOU

746
00:20:45,912 --> 00:20:46,946
A LITTLE BIT WITH THIS.

747
00:20:46,946 --> 00:20:47,714
>> OKAY.

748

1121
00:33:30,242 --> 00:33:31,277
>> YEAH, HE'S THIRD.

1122
00:33:31,277 --> 00:33:32,911
[laughter]

1123
00:33:32,911 --> 00:33:33,579
>> OKAY...

1124
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:35,581
>> WOW.

1125
00:33:35,581 --> 00:33:36,482
>> WELL, HE'S NEVER TAKEN CARE

1126
00:33:36,482 --> 00:33:37,383
OF--I MEAN, HE'S WATCHED HIM

1127
00:33:37,383 --> 00:33:38,350
MAYBE, LIKE, TWO HOURS AT THE

1128
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,486
MOST BY HIMSELF, BUT IT'S JUST

1129
00:33:40,486 --> 00:33:43,222
LIKE--I DON'T KNOW.

1130
00:33:43,222 --> 00:33:44,190
HE GETS TIRED OF IT REALLY

1131
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:46,058
EASILY, AND HE DOESN'T FEEL LIKE

1132
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:47,526
DOING IT, AND IT MAKES ME SO,

1133
00:33:47,526 --> 00:33:48,760
LIKE, IRRITATED SOMETIMES.

1134
00:33:48,760 --> 00:33:51,363
LIKE, DANIEL DOESN'T FEED HIM

1135
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,432
EVER, SO I MEAN, IT'S MORE

1136
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:55,767
STRESSFUL, I GUESS.

1137
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:57,103
>> WELL, DANIEL SHOULD HELP YOU.

1138
00:33:57,103 --> 00:33:58,337
>> YEAH, THAT'S WHAT EVERYBODY

1139
00:33:58,337 --> 00:33:59,138
SAYS, BUT...

1140
00:33:59,138 --> 00:34:00,038
>> LIKE, WHEN HE DOES COME OVER.

1141
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,407
>> HE'S LIAM'S DAD.

1142
00:34:01,407 --> 00:34:02,308
>> YEAH.

1143
00:34:02,308 --> 00:34:04,910
>> BUT ARE YOU STILL GETTING

1144
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:05,677
HOME SCHOOLED?

1145
00:34:05,677 --> 00:34:07,446
>> YEAH, BUT I JUST FINISHED

1146
00:34:07,446 --> 00:34:09,014
MY 11TH GRADE YEAR.

1147
00:34:09,014 --> 00:34:09,848
>> ARE YOU ALMOST READY TO

1148
00:34:09,848 --> 00:34:10,916
FINISH?

1149
00:34:10,916 --> 00:34:12,684
>> OH, NO, I JUST STARTED, LIKE,

1150
00:34:12,684 --> 00:34:15,254
ONE BOOK, LIKE LAST WEEK.

1151
00:34:15,254 --> 00:34:15,921
>> EMILY!

1152
00:34:15,921 --> 00:34:16,922
>> GOSH, YOU HAVE TO WORK, LIKE,

1153
00:34:16,922 --> 00:34:18,424
SUPER HARD.

1154
00:34:18,424 --> 00:34:19,858
>> IT IS A LOT HARDER THAN I

1155
00:34:19,858 --> 00:34:21,293
THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE.

1156
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:23,329
IT'S A CONSTANT, LIKE, 24-HOUR,

1157
00:34:23,329 --> 00:34:25,297
SEVEN-DAYS-A-WEEK JOB.

1158
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:26,565
I NEED TO GET SOME ANXIETY PILLS

1159
00:34:26,565 --> 00:34:28,033
OR SOMETHING.

1160
00:34:28,033 --> 00:34:30,136
[laughs]

1161
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:38,110
I'VE BEEN SO OVERWHELMED WITH

1162
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:39,511
TAKING CARE OF LIAM THAT I HAD

1163
00:34:39,511 --> 00:34:40,946
TO ASK MY STEPMOM TO WATCH HIM

1164
00:34:40,946 --> 00:34:42,648
WHILE I TRY AND CATCH UP ON

1165
00:34:42,648 --> 00:34:44,150
SCHOOLWORK.

1166
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:44,883
[baby crying]

1167
00:34:44,883 --> 00:34:46,585
BUT IT'S REALLY NOT HER JOB;

1168
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:50,722
IT'S DANIEL'S.

1169
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:52,591
HE AND I HAVE BEEN SO BUSY

1170
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:54,426
ARGUING OVER WHO HELPS OUT MORE

1171
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:55,994
WITH THE BABY THAT WE HAVEN'T

1172
00:34:55,994 --> 00:34:57,095
REALLY BEEN TALKING ABOUT OUR

1173
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,096
WEDDING PLANS AT ALL.

1174
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,031
I'M STARTING TO WORRY THAT

1175
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:01,333
GETTING MARRIED IN JUNE MIGHT

1176
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:02,534
BE TOO SOON.

1177
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:03,502
>> YOU DON'T THINK WE'RE TOO

1178
00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:04,636
YOUNG TO GET MARRIED?

1179
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:06,872
>> I MEAN, PEOPLE USED TO GET

1180
00:35:06,872 --> 00:35:08,006
MARRIED WHEN THEY WERE, LIKE,

1181
00:35:08,006 --> 00:35:09,441
13 OR 14 YEARS OLD.

1182
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,343
>> YEAH, WELL, I GUESS I'M

1183
00:35:11,343 --> 00:35:13,078
EXCITED.

1184
00:35:13,078 --> 00:35:14,213
>> NO, YOU'RE NOT.

1185
00:35:14,213 --> 00:35:16,882
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

1186
00:35:16,882 --> 00:35:19,485
>> YOU'RE MAD HALF THE TIME.

1187
00:35:19,485 --> 00:35:20,752
>> NO, I'M NOT.

1188
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:21,887
>> YEAH, YOU ARE.

1189
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:23,689
>> SOMETIMES.

1190
00:35:23,689 --> 00:35:24,723
I JUST DON'T WANT TO FEEL LIKE

1191
00:35:24,723 --> 00:35:26,492
I'M STUCK WITH YOU.

1192
00:35:26,492 --> 00:35:28,427
>> WELL, YOU ARE.

1193
00:35:28,427 --> 00:35:29,928
>> WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

1194
00:35:29,928 --> 00:35:32,831
>> KINDA BOUND TOGETHER.

1195
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:34,800
>> HOW COME?

1196
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,469
>> BECAUSE OF LIAM?

1197
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,538
>> AND I LOVE YOU.

1198
00:35:39,538 --> 00:35:42,374
>> I KNOW.

1199
00:35:42,374 --> 00:35:43,609
I MEAN, IT'S NOT A BAD THING.

1200
00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:44,876
IT JUST SOUNDS KIND OF LIKE--

1201
00:35:44,876 --> 00:35:45,877
"YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME,"

1202
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:46,978
LIKE YOU DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER

1203
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:47,713
CHOICES.

1204
00:35:47,713 --> 00:35:48,480
>> YOU DON'T.

1205
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,648
>> [stammers]

1206
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:51,817
OKAY, WHATEVER.

1207
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:52,784
>> I'M READY FOR HIM TO BE ABLE

1208
00:35:52,784 --> 00:35:54,553
TO TALK SO HE CAN BE A LITTLE

1209
00:35:54,553 --> 00:35:57,022
SMARTER, JUST LIKE HIS MOM.

1210
00:35:57,022 --> 00:35:59,991
>> SHH.

1211
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,360
DANIEL SAYS I DON'T HAVE ANY

1212
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,395
CHOICES, BUT DECIDING WHEN TO

1213
00:36:03,395 --> 00:36:05,531
GET MARRIED IS REALLY UP TO ME.

1214
00:36:18,977 --> 00:36:20,011
>> DANIEL WILL BE STARTING

1215
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:21,580
COLLEGE IN HUNTSVILLE SOON AND

1216
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,814
WILL WANT ME AND THE BABY TO

1217
00:36:22,814 --> 00:36:24,416
FOLLOW HIM THERE, BUT I'M NOT

1218
00:36:24,416 --> 00:36:25,817
SURE THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

1219
00:36:25,817 --> 00:36:27,419
I THOUGHT HAVING A BABY WOULD

1220
00:36:27,419 --> 00:36:28,854
BRING US CLOSER TOGETHER, YET

1221
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:30,456
SOMEHOW IT'S ONLY MADE ME MORE

1222
00:36:30,456 --> 00:36:33,225
FRUSTRATED WITH DANIEL.

1223
00:36:33,225 --> 00:36:34,326
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO GET MARRIED IN

1224
00:36:34,326 --> 00:36:35,894
JUNE, BUT I THINK I NEED MORE

1225
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:37,729
TIME TO FIGURE THIS OUT.

1226
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:40,632
RIGHT NOW, SINCE HE DON'T HELP

1227
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:41,667
TAKE CARE OF LIAM ALL THE TIME

1228
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:43,969
LIKE I DO, HE GETS ON MY NERVES,

1229
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:45,437
AND I THINK THAT I'M GONNA GET

1230
00:36:45,437 --> 00:36:46,605
IRRITATED WITH HIM AND JUST FEEL

1231
00:36:46,605 --> 00:36:47,573
LIKE I DON'T WANT TO BE WITH HIM

1232
00:36:47,573 --> 00:36:48,940
ANYMORE, 'CAUSE THAT'S HOW I

1233
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:49,775
FEEL NOW.

1234
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:50,876
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1235
00:36:50,876 --> 00:36:52,177
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT AROUND HIM

1236
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:52,978
ENOUGH.

1237
00:36:52,978 --> 00:36:54,246
ALL I KNOW IS, HE ACTS LIKE HE'S

1238
00:36:54,246 --> 00:36:56,548
TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING,

1239
00:36:56,548 --> 00:36:57,849
AND THERE'S SOME REASON NOW

1240
00:36:57,849 --> 00:37:00,018
YOU DON'T CLICK WITH HIM.

1241
00:37:00,018 --> 00:37:01,320
>> 'CAUSE DANIEL IRRITATES ME

1242
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:04,290
SOMETIMES.

1243
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:07,025
A LOT OF THE TIME.

1244
00:37:07,025 --> 00:37:07,959
>> IF YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE NOT

1245
00:37:07,959 --> 00:37:09,461
GONNA GET ALONG WITH HIM NOW,

1246
00:37:09,461 --> 00:37:10,562
WHAT'S GONNA CHANGE WHEN YOU

1247
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:11,963
MOVE OFF AND LIVE TOGETHER?

1248
00:37:11,963 --> 00:37:13,198
>> BECAUSE WE'LL ALL BE

1249
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:14,132
TOGETHER.

1250
00:37:14,132 --> 00:37:16,201
ALL I'LL I'M SAYING IS, MOVE UP

1251
00:37:16,201 --> 00:37:17,736
THERE AND LIVE TOGETHER FOR HALF

1252
00:37:17,736 --> 00:37:20,038
A YEAR, SIX MONTHS, AND IF

1253
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:21,873
EVERYTHING'S PEACHY STILL, GET

1254
00:37:21,873 --> 00:37:23,208
MARRIED.

1255
00:37:23,208 --> 00:37:24,876
AND IF IT'S NOT PEACHY, THEN WE

1256
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:27,012
EITHER WILL DECIDE IF WE DON'T

1257
00:37:27,012 --> 00:37:29,014
NEED TO BE TOGETHER OR IF WE

1258
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:30,716
NEED TO SEE IF WE CAN WORK IT

1259
00:37:30,716 --> 00:37:32,017
OUT A LITTLE BIT LONGER.

1260
00:37:32,017 --> 00:37:32,884
>> SOUNDS LIKE TO ME YOU'RE

1261
00:37:32,884 --> 00:37:34,152
PRETTY POSITIVE THAT Y'ALL ARE

1262
00:37:34,152 --> 00:37:35,587
NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO LIVE

1263
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,155
TOGETHER FOR VERY LONG.

1264
00:37:37,155 --> 00:37:38,256
>> I'M JUST SAYING THAT THAT WAS

1265
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:38,957
A THOUGHT.

1266
00:37:38,957 --> 00:37:40,025
IT WAS A FEELING.

1267
00:37:40,025 --> 00:37:41,427
DANIEL DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING

1268
00:37:41,427 --> 00:37:44,262
ABOUT IT...

1269
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,664
'CAUSE HE PROBABLY WOULDN'T

1270
00:37:45,664 --> 00:37:48,133
LIKE IT.

1271
00:37:48,133 --> 00:37:49,100
>> [sighs]

1272
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,135
YOU MADE A CHOICE.

1273
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:51,737
>> I KNOW THAT.

1274
00:37:51,737 --> 00:37:52,571
>> WELL, WHEN ARE YOU GONNA

1275
00:37:52,571 --> 00:37:54,373
WAKE THE HELL UP AND KNOW THAT

1276
00:37:54,373 --> 00:37:55,707
IS NOW?

1277
00:37:55,707 --> 00:37:58,977
YOU GOT A BABY, SWEETIE.

1278
00:37:58,977 --> 00:38:00,011
>> I KNOW DANIEL WANTS TO GET

1279
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:01,847
MARRIED BEFORE STARTING COLLEGE,

1280
00:38:01,847 --> 00:38:03,415
BUT I NEED TO MAKE SURE WE CAN

1281
00:38:03,415 --> 00:38:05,083
LIVE TOGETHER FIRST.

1282
00:38:05,083 --> 00:38:06,618
AFTER TALKING TO MY DAD, I

1283
00:38:06,618 --> 00:38:08,253
DECIDED TO TELL DANIEL THAT WE

1284
00:38:08,253 --> 00:38:09,421
SHOULD HOLD OFF ON GETTING

1285
00:38:09,421 --> 00:38:10,889
MARRIED THIS SUMMER.

1286
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:11,723
HE DIDN'T EXACTLY TAKE

1287
00:38:11,723 --> 00:38:13,191
THE NEWS WELL.

1288
00:38:13,191 --> 00:38:14,259
>> YOU FEEL BAD?

1289
00:38:14,259 --> 00:38:16,294
>> YEAH.

1290
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:17,262
>> 'CAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GET

1291
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:18,630
MARRIED ON JUNE 26TH?

1292
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,565
>> WELL, IT DOESN'T REALLY

1293
00:38:19,565 --> 00:38:20,298
MATTER.

1294
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:22,468
YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

1295
00:38:22,468 --> 00:38:24,570
>> WELL, I DON'T THINK WE

1296
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:25,704
TOOK ENOUGH TIME TO LOOK AT

1297
00:38:25,704 --> 00:38:27,005
EVERYTHING, AND WE JUST JUMPED

1298
00:38:27,005 --> 00:38:29,675
INTO IT, AND I MEAN, I'M SORRY

1299
00:38:29,675 --> 00:38:31,843
FOR CHANGING MY MIND, BUT I WAS

1300
00:38:31,843 --> 00:38:34,646
JUST REALIZING HOW DIFFERENT

1301
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,882
THINGS WERE AND HOW EVERYBODY

1302
00:38:36,882 --> 00:38:38,850
WAS LIKE, "OH, MY GOSH, DANIEL'S

1303
00:38:38,850 --> 00:38:39,718
GONNA GO TO SCHOOL.

1304
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:40,752
YAY."

1305
00:38:40,752 --> 00:38:41,920
AND I WAS JUST LIKE, "WELL, YOU

1306
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,990
KNOW, I MIGHT AS WELL JUST DO

1307
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,358
THE HOME SCHOOL SO I CAN

1308
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:47,559
GRADUATE SO WE CAN ALL STAY

1309
00:38:47,559 --> 00:38:48,560
TOGETHER."

1310
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,928
AND THEN NOW I HAVE TO GO TO

1311
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:50,896
SCHOOL THERE.

1312
00:38:50,896 --> 00:38:52,531
>> SO YOU DON'T WANT TO LIVE

1313
00:38:52,531 --> 00:38:53,298
WITH ME?

1314
00:38:53,298 --> 00:38:54,700
>> WELL, I REALLY DON'T WANT TO

1315
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,867
GO TO SCHOOL UP THERE.

1316
00:38:55,867 --> 00:38:58,036
>> [bleep] GREAT.

1317
00:38:58,036 --> 00:38:59,505

1319
00:39:01,507 --> 00:39:02,273
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1320
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:04,943
>> CAN YOU TRY IT FOR A YEAR?

1321
00:39:04,943 --> 00:39:06,111
>> AND PAY FOR SOMEWHERE WHERE

1322
00:39:06,111 --> 00:39:07,145
WE'RE GONNA LIVE THAT I DON'T

1323
00:39:07,145 --> 00:39:08,414
WANT TO MOVE ANYWAYS?

1324
00:39:08,414 --> 00:39:09,247
>> WHERE ELSE AM I GONNA GO

1325
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:10,048
TO SCHOOL?

1326
00:39:10,048 --> 00:39:11,517
WHERE ELSE AM I GONNA BE ABLE TO

1327
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:12,984
GET A SCHOLARSHIPS LIKE THAT?

1328
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:14,319

00:39:14,319 --> 00:39:15,487
>> [sighs]

1330
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:19,458
>> IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT YOU.

1331
00:39:19,458 --> 00:39:20,492
>> I KNOW IT'S NOT.

1332
00:39:20,492 --> 00:39:21,993
I JUST WISH YOU HADN'T ALL OF A

1333
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:23,361
SUDDEN CHANGED YOUR MIND.

1334
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,464
>> I GUESS I REALIZED I HAVE

1335
00:39:25,464 --> 00:39:28,333
OTHER OPTIONS.

1336
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:30,168
>> THAT'S WHAT MAKES ME UPSET.

1337
00:39:30,168 --> 00:39:32,804
>> WHY?

1338
00:39:32,804 --> 00:39:33,839
>> 'CAUSE SOME OF 'EM DON'T

1339
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:36,274
INCLUDE ME.

1340
00:39:36,274 --> 00:39:38,109
>> KINDA TIRED OF TALKING.

1341
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:40,311
>> WELL, I DON'T REALLY CARE.

1342
00:39:40,311 --> 00:39:41,713
>> [sighs]

1343
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:42,881
I'M GONNA GO OUTSIDE.

1344
00:39:42,881 --> 00:39:45,050
>> NO.

1345
00:39:50,121 --> 00:39:51,723
I THINK I'VE REALIZED IN THE

1346
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:55,527
PAST COUPLE WEEKS THAT DANIEL

1347
00:39:55,527 --> 00:39:58,997
AND I NEED SOME TIME TO REALLY

1348
00:39:58,997 --> 00:40:01,032
THINK ABOUT OUR RELATIONSHIP.

1349
00:40:01,032 --> 00:40:03,735
BEING 16 AND HAVING A BABY, I'M

1350
00:40:03,735 --> 00:40:05,504
NOT STABLE IN THE RELATIONSHIP

1351
00:40:05,504 --> 00:40:07,338
WITH DANIEL.

1352
00:40:07,338 --> 00:40:09,074
I CAN'T FINISH MY EDUCATION

1353
00:40:09,074 --> 00:40:11,877
RIGHT AWAY, SO IT'S HARD.

1354
00:40:11,877 --> 00:40:14,145
I DEFINITELY WISHED I WOULD HAVE

1355
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:15,514
WAITED.

1356
00:40:15,514 --> 00:40:17,983
IT'S A CONSTANT, 24-HOUR,

1357
00:40:17,983 --> 00:40:20,919
EVERY-SINGLE-DAY JOB, AND I JUST

1358
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,622
REALLY HATE THE FACT THAT I'VE

1359
00:40:23,622 --> 00:40:25,356
GIVEN UP WAY MORE THAN HE HAS.

1360
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:28,193
I REALLY HOPE THAT LIAM IS PROUD

1361
00:40:28,193 --> 00:40:30,095
OF ME IN THE FUTURE, AND WHEN

1362
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:31,830
HE'S 16 AND 17 AND HE LOOKS AT

1363
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:34,600
HIS LIFE, I WANT HIM TO REALLY

1364
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,335
REALIZE AND UNDERSTAND WHAT I

1365
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:39,070
GAVE UP FOR HIM.

1366
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:40,005
I JUST HOPE HE LEARNS FROM OUR

1367
00:40:40,005 --> 00:40:43,274
MISTAKES TO NOT GET SOMEBODY

1368
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,210

"I WANT HER TO BE PREGNANT

1379
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:14,405
THAT WAS NOT MY DREAM

1380
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:15,741
FOR MY CHILD.

1381
00:41:15,741 --> 00:41:16,875
