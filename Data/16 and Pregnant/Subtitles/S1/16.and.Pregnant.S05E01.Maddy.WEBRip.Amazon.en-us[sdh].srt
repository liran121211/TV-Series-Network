00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,367
>> HI, I'M MADDY.

3
00:00:08,367 --> 00:00:10,300
I'M 16 AND LIVE IN TINLEY PARK,

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:12,200
ILLINOIS, OUTSIDE OF CHICAGO.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:14,100
WE HAVE A FULL HOUSE, WITH MY

00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:16,333
MOM, MY BROTHER, KYLE, MY

7
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:17,967
SISTER, EMILY, AND MY BABY

HALF SISTER, ALYSSA.

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,767
MY PARENTS ARE DIVORCED, AND MY

10
00:00:21,767 --> 00:00:23,133
DAD LIVES AN HOUR AWAY IN

11
00:00:23,133 --> 00:00:24,833
INDIANA, BUT WE'RE STILL SUPER

12
00:00:24,833 --> 00:00:25,500
CLOSE.

13
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,733
[giggles]

14
00:00:26,733 --> 00:00:28,067
I'M ABOUT TO START MY JUNIOR

15
00:00:28,067 --> 00:00:29,767
YEAR, AND I PLAY ON ALL THE

16
00:00:29,767 --> 00:00:31,733
SPORTS TEAMS AT SCHOOL.

17
00:00:31,733 --> 00:00:32,967
BUT WHEN I'M NOT ON THE COURT,

18
00:00:32,967 --> 00:00:34,200
I'M GETTING SILLY WITH MY BEST

19
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,433
FRIENDS.

20
00:00:35,433 --> 00:00:36,767
A FEW MONTHS AGO, MY

21
00:00:36,767 --> 00:00:38,633
EX-BOYFRIEND DUMPED ME, AND I

22
00:00:38,633 --> 00:00:40,767
WAS REALLY UPSET, SO I WENT ON

23
00:00:40,767 --> 00:00:42,833
FACEBOOK, LOOKING FOR A REBOUND,

24
00:00:42,833 --> 00:00:44,533
WHEN I MESSAGED CODY.

25
00:00:44,533 --> 00:00:45,700
AFTER KNOWING EACH OTHER FOR

26
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:47,933
ONLY AN HOUR, WE HOOKED UP.

27
00:00:47,933 --> 00:00:49,700
IT WAS JUST A ONE-TIME THING,

28
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,967
SO WE HAVEN'T BEEN HANGING OUT

29
00:00:50,967 --> 00:00:52,367
SINCE.

30
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:53,333
BUT NOW HE'S GOING TO BE IN MY

31
00:00:53,333 --> 00:00:55,267
LIFE FOREVER, BECAUSE, AFTER A

32
00:00:55,267 --> 00:00:57,867
ONE-NIGHT STAND, I'M PREGNANT.

33
00:00:57,867 --> 00:00:59,867
[chime dings]

34
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,333
IN TWO MONTHS, I'LL BE HAVING

35
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:13,933
A BABY GIRL, AND I DECIDED TO

36
00:01:13,933 --> 00:01:15,700
NAME HER AUBREY.

37
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,733
MY PREGNANCY HAS BEEN PRETTY

38
00:01:16,733 --> 00:01:19,167
UNCOMFORTABLE, SO I HAVEN'T HAD

39
00:01:19,167 --> 00:01:20,600
MUCH FUN THIS SUMMER.

40
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,800
BUT TODAY, MY FRIENDS ARE COMING

41
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,800
OVER TO HANG OUT.

42
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:27,100
>> HEY, MADDY.

43
00:01:27,100 --> 00:01:27,767
>> HI.

44
00:01:27,767 --> 00:01:28,633
>> HEY, MADDY. WHAT'S UP?

45
00:01:28,633 --> 00:01:29,700
>> YOU LOOK SO LITTLE.

46
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:30,800
>> 'CAUSE I'M WEARING BLACK,

47
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,833
IT LOOKS SO SMALL.

48
00:01:31,833 --> 00:01:33,133
>> YOU LOOK SMALL.

49
00:01:33,133 --> 00:01:34,300
>> I'LL BE EIGHT MONTHS

50
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,367
TOMORROW.

51
00:01:35,367 --> 00:01:36,067
>> THAT'S EXCITING.

52
00:01:36,067 --> 00:01:36,900
>> OH, MY GOD, THAT'S CRAZY.

53
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,833
>> IT WENT BY SO FAST.

54
00:01:37,833 --> 00:01:38,800
>> SERIOUSLY, LIKE, I REMEMBER,

55
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,267
YOU USED TO BE, LIKE, THIS BIG

56
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,167
WITH YOUR SIX-PACK GOING ON,

57
00:01:42,167 --> 00:01:43,467
AND YOU WERE ALL ABOUT SPORTS.

58
00:01:43,467 --> 00:01:44,333
LIKE, IN GYM, YOU DID

59
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:46,167
EVERYTHING, AND NOW IT'S LIKE--

60
00:01:46,167 --> 00:01:47,233
>> NOW I CAN'T EVEN PLAY ANY

61
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:47,900
SPORTS.

62
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,733
>> OH, MY GOD.

63
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:49,800
>> I MEAN, SPORTS WERE MY LIFE.

64
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,500
LIKE, I COULD'VE HAD

65
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,200
A SCHOLARSHIP FOR MY SPORTS.

66
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:52,867
>> YEAH.

67
00:01:52,867 --> 00:01:54,567
>> YOU WERE, LIKE, SO SHOCKED.

68
00:01:54,567 --> 00:01:55,400
>> I WASN'T READY FOR A BABY

69
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:55,967
YET.

70
00:01:55,967 --> 00:01:56,700
>> I KNOW.

71
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:58,833
>> LIKE, THE WHOLE REASON I'M IN

72
00:01:58,833 --> 00:02:00,067
THIS SITUATION RIGHT NOW IS

73
00:02:00,067 --> 00:02:01,067
BECAUSE I WAS TRYING TO GET OVER

74
00:02:01,067 --> 00:02:03,733
MY EX, AND THEN I SLEEP WITH

75
00:02:03,733 --> 00:02:06,233
CODY ONE TIME AND THIS HAPPENED.

76
00:02:06,233 --> 00:02:07,500
>> OH, MY GOD.

77
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:08,967
>> HOW DID CODY REACT?

78
00:02:08,967 --> 00:02:10,100
HE HAD TO BE SHOCKED.

79
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:11,767
>> I MEAN, I WAS IN DENIAL.

80
00:02:11,767 --> 00:02:13,600
JUST LIKE, I BARELY KNOW HIM AND

81
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:14,500
THEN I'M GOING TO RAISE A BABY

82
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:15,400
WITH HIM WHEN WE DON'T EVEN--

83
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,733
WE'VE HUNG OUT, LIKE, SIX TIMES?

84
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:17,533
>> YEAH, TRUE.

85
00:02:17,533 --> 00:02:19,533
>> SO I LITERALLY CALLED HIM,

86
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:21,267
AND I WAS LIKE, "SO YOU'RE GONNA

87
00:02:21,267 --> 00:02:22,333
BE A FATHER," AND HE'S JUST

88
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,267
LIKE, "WOW."

89
00:02:23,267 --> 00:02:25,200
LIKE, DIDN'T EVEN--LIKE,

90
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:26,567
HE DIDN'T EVEN CARE.

91
00:02:26,567 --> 00:02:27,367
HE DIDN'T THINK IT WAS HIS

92
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:27,967
KID.

93
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:28,800
>> WOW.

94
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,700
>> AND THERE'S NO WAY IT COULD

95
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,367
BE ANYONE ELSE'S.

96
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:31,333
>> YEAH, WHO ELSE--

97
00:02:31,333 --> 00:02:32,367
>> BUT HE JUST DIDN'T WANT IT TO

98
00:02:32,367 --> 00:02:33,067
BE HIS.

99
00:02:33,067 --> 00:02:34,833
>> SERIOUSLY? WOW.

100
00:02:34,833 --> 00:02:36,933
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

101
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:38,333
BUT HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE COMING

102
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,367
TO MY DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT WITH

103
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,433
ME THIS WEEK, THE FIRST ONE HE'S

104
00:02:41,433 --> 00:02:42,967
EVER BEEN TO, BUT I DON'T SEE IT

105
00:02:42,967 --> 00:02:43,800
HAPPENING.

106
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,767
SO...

107
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:47,767
IT'S JUST REALLY STRESSFUL.

108
00:02:54,867 --> 00:02:56,100
HAVE YOU GUYS GOTTEN USED TO THE

109
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:57,500
FACT THAT I'M PREGNANT YET?

110
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,533
>> I MEAN, IT'S STILL WEIRD,

111
00:02:59,533 --> 00:03:00,367
BUT...

112
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:01,933
>> KIND OF HAVE TO ACCEPT IT.

113
00:03:01,933 --> 00:03:03,167
I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE

114
00:03:03,167 --> 00:03:05,133
A GOOD MOM, THOUGH.

115
00:03:05,133 --> 00:03:06,467
>> I DO TOO 'CAUSE THE WAY I AM

116
00:03:06,467 --> 00:03:07,467
WITH ALYSSA.

117
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:08,533
I'M SURE CODY'S, LIKE,

118
00:03:08,533 --> 00:03:09,367
FREAKING OUT.

119
00:03:09,367 --> 00:03:10,967
HE'S NEVER MET KYLE OR EMILY.

120
00:03:10,967 --> 00:03:11,967
HE DOESN'T EVEN REALLY KNOW YOU,

121
00:03:11,967 --> 00:03:12,700
MOM.

122
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,733
>> WHOSE FAULT IS THAT?

123
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:14,567
>> I MEAN, WHAT DO YOU SAY

124
00:03:14,567 --> 00:03:15,233
TO ME?

125
00:03:15,233 --> 00:03:16,333
LIKE, "HI, I GOT YOUR SISTER

126
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,067
PREGNANT"?

127
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:17,833
LIKE, "NICE TO MEET YOU"?

128
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:18,500
>> KYLE.

129
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,167
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

130
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:19,833
HEY, WE GOT TO GET

131
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:20,500
TO KNOW HIM, RIGHT?

132
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,233
HE'S GONNA BE PART OF

133
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:23,167
EVERYBODY'S LIFE.

134
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,367
>> CODY'S HERE.

135
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:34,833
>> HELLO.

136
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:35,700
>> HI.

137
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,900
>> YOU GUYS READY?

138
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,567
>> YEP.

139
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:39,567
>> ALL RIGHT.

140
00:03:42,467 --> 00:03:43,667
>> YOU EXCITED?

141
00:03:43,667 --> 00:03:44,533
>> YEAH.

142
00:03:44,533 --> 00:03:45,367
I HAVEN'T SEEN HER IN A LONG

143
00:03:45,367 --> 00:03:46,933
TIME.

144
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:48,067
>> OKAY, LET ME TURN THE LIGHTS

145
00:03:48,067 --> 00:03:48,667
OFF.

146
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:51,300
>> IT'S SO COLD.

147
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,133
>> THERE WE GO.

148
00:03:53,133 --> 00:03:55,733
SO THERE'S THE BABY'S HEAD.

149
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:58,600
SO HER FACE IS RIGHT HERE.

150
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,300
OKAY?

151
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,067
>> IS SHE FACE--

152
00:04:00,067 --> 00:04:00,733
HEAD DOWN ALREADY?

153
00:04:00,733 --> 00:04:01,567
>> YEAH, SHE'S HEAD DOWN.

154
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:02,400
>> WOW.

155
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,667
>> GOOD GIRL.

156
00:04:03,667 --> 00:04:06,933
HERE'S KIND OF THE HAND.

157
00:04:06,933 --> 00:04:08,667
HERE'S THE NOSE.

158
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:09,733
>> YOU SEE YOURSELF IN THERE?

159
00:04:09,733 --> 00:04:10,733
BECAUSE SHE LOOKS EXACTLY LIKE

160
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:11,567
YOU.

161
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:13,367

166
00:04:18,467 --> 00:04:19,200
IT'S GOOD.

167
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,233
CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN.

168
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:22,333
EXCITED?

169
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,167
>> YEAH. IT'S CRAZY.

170
00:04:23,167 --> 00:04:23,967
>> IT MAKES IT A LITTLE BIT MORE

171
00:04:23,967 --> 00:04:25,333

>> I'M HAPPY CODY FINALLY SEEMS

174
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:29,567
EXCITED TO BE A DAD.

175
00:04:31,533 --> 00:04:33,300
SHE'S KICKING.

176
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,667
>> OH, I FELT THAT ONE.

177
00:04:35,667 --> 00:04:36,467
>> I DIDN'T FEEL ANYTHING

178
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:37,133
THAT TIME.

179
00:04:37,133 --> 00:04:37,800

[both chuckle]

182
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,133
IT'S CRAZY.

183
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:43,600
TIME'S FLYING.

184
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,133
>> FOR YOU, BECAUSE YOU HAVEN'T

185
00:04:45,133 --> 00:04:46,633
BEEN THERE THE WHOLE TIME.

186
00:04:46,633 --> 00:04:47,900
DIFFERENT FOR ME.

187
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,900
I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN PREGNANT

188
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,067
FOR, LIKE, 12 YEARS.

189
00:04:50,067 --> 00:04:50,967
>> [chuckles]

190
00:04:50,967 --> 00:04:53,933
YEAH, I KNOW, BUT WERE YOU GLAD

191
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:55,367
I WAS THERE FOR THE FIRST TIME

192
00:04:55,367 --> 00:04:56,633
AT THE DOCTOR'S?

193
00:04:56,633 --> 00:04:58,433
>> YEAH, IT MEANS A LOT TO ME

194
00:04:58,433 --> 00:04:59,567
AND THE BABY THAT YOU'RE THERE.

195
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:00,633
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

196
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:01,467
>> I DON'T WANT YOU TO MISS

197
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:02,233
ANYTHING ELSE.

198
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:02,900
>> I KNOW.

199
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,767
I DON'T WANT TO MISS ANYTHING

200
00:05:03,767 --> 00:05:04,533
ELSE EITHER.

201
00:05:04,533 --> 00:05:05,700
I PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE IN THIS

202
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,067
SITUATION.

203
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:07,967
I SHOULD'VE LISTENED IN HEALTH

204
00:05:07,967 --> 00:05:09,267
CLASS A LITTLE MORE.

205
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:10,633
I SHOULD'VE USED A CONDOM.

206
00:05:10,633 --> 00:05:13,067
>> YEAH, PROBABLY.

207
00:05:13,067 --> 00:05:14,333
DON'T THEY SHOW YOU HOW TO PUT

208
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,733
ON A CONDOM IN HEALTH CLASS?

209
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,067
>> THEY DON'T, LIKE, DO IT,

210
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:17,700
THOUGH.

211
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,900
>> THEY DON'T DO IT FOR YOU,

212
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,600
YEAH, I HOPE SO.

213
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,467
>> NO, I MEAN, LIKE, I DIDN'T,

214
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:22,500
LIKE--I PUT IT ON, AND YOU SAID

215
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,267
IT WAS ON WRONG, SO...

216
00:05:23,267 --> 00:05:24,667
>> 'CAUSE YOU KEPT SAYING, "OW."

217
00:05:24,667 --> 00:05:25,600
WHO SAYS "OW" PUTTING ON

218
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,267
A CONDOM?

219
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:27,133
I'VE NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE.

220
00:05:27,133 --> 00:05:29,067
I DON'T KNOW... [laughs]

221
00:05:29,067 --> 00:05:30,133
BUT IT'S GOOD THAT YOU'RE

222
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:31,367
ACTUALLY GOING TO THINGS NOW

223
00:05:31,367 --> 00:05:33,100
AND, LIKE, STEPPING UP.

224
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,100
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

225
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,200
>> I WANT AUBREY TO HAVE BOTH

226
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,800
HER PARENTS IN HER LIFE,

227
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,200
BUT IT'S GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME

228
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,233
TO FIGURE OUT IF THERE'S

229
00:05:42,233 --> 00:05:44,600
ANYTHING MORE BETWEEN US.

230
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,700
WITH MY DUE DATE LESS THAN TWO

231
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,667
MONTHS AWAY, MY MOM WANTS TO GO

232
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:56,967
OVER THE PLAN FOR AFTER THE

233
00:05:56,967 --> 00:05:58,967
BIRTH.

234
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:01,067
>> IT'S HARD FOR ME TO SEE MY

235
00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:03,167
BABY WITH A BABY INSIDE HER.

236
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:04,567
I JUST BECAME A MOM AGAIN THREE

237
00:06:04,567 --> 00:06:05,700
MONTHS AGO.

238
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,633
I'M NOT READY TO BE CALLED

239
00:06:06,633 --> 00:06:08,167
A GRANDMA YET.

240
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:09,333
I'LL NEVER FORGET THE WAY YOU

241
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:10,467
TOLD ME,

242
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:11,667
FOR YOU TO TEXT ME TO COME

243
00:06:11,667 --> 00:06:12,900
UPSTAIRS 'CAUSE YOU HAD

244
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,633
TO TALK TO ME.

245
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:14,800
>> BUT I TOLD YOU IN PERSON.

246
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,967
>> AND WHEN I CAME UPSTAIRS,

247
00:06:16,967 --> 00:06:18,600
WHAT WAS MY FIRST WORDS?

248
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,833
"YOU BETTER NOT TELL ME

249
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:22,067
YOU'RE PREGNANT."

250
00:06:22,067 --> 00:06:23,400
AND WHAT'D YOU SAY TO ME?

251
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,100
>> "SORRY."

252
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,933
>> "I'M SO SORRY, MOM."

253
00:06:25,933 --> 00:06:27,733
IT'S A LOT OF WORK, MADISON.

254
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:29,367
>> I KNOW.

255
00:06:29,367 --> 00:06:30,267
>> I JUST THINK YOU'RE TOO YOUNG

256
00:06:30,267 --> 00:06:30,900
FOR THIS.

257
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,767
I THINK YOUR WHOLE LIFE IS...

258
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:34,800
DONE.

259
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:35,900
ALL THE PLANS THAT YOU HAD FOR

260
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,400
YOUR FUTURE, BEING A LAWYER,

261
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,400
DOING INTERIOR DESIGN,

262
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,267
DO YOU STILL PLAN ON DOING ANY

263
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:40,933
OF THAT?

264
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:41,867
>> I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE TRYING TO,

265
00:06:41,867 --> 00:06:43,067
LIKE, SCARE ME MORE THAN

266
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:43,733
I SHOULD BE.

267
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:44,633
>> I'M NOT TRYING TO SCARE YOU.

268
00:06:44,633 --> 00:06:45,533
I'M TRYING TO PREPARE YOU.

269
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:47,067
THIS IS A LOT OF WORK.

270
00:06:47,067 --> 00:06:48,267
>> I KNOW THAT, BUT YOU MAKE IT

271
00:06:48,267 --> 00:06:49,500
SOUND SO NEGATIVE.

272
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,067
>> IT'S NEGATIVE WHEN YOU'RE 16.

273
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:52,300
YOU DON'T HAVE A JOB.

274
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:53,833
YOU'RE JUST SUPPOSED TO BE

275
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:54,633
STARTING YOUR JUNIOR YEAR IN

276
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:55,300
SCHOOL.

277
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,833
>> CODY HAS A JOB.

278
00:06:56,833 --> 00:07:00,433
>> HIS FAST-FOOD RESTAURANT JOB?

279
00:07:00,433 --> 00:07:01,967
>> [sniffles]

280
00:07:01,967 --> 00:07:03,400
YOU MAKE IT SEEM LIKE MY LIFE

281
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,067
IS, LIKE, RUINED.

282
00:07:05,067 --> 00:07:06,267
>> I FEEL THAT IT IS.

283
00:07:06,267 --> 00:07:08,533
>> IT'S NOT.

284
00:07:08,533 --> 00:07:09,633
JUST 'CAUSE I'M HAVING A BABY

285
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:10,700
DOESN'T MEAN EVERYTHING IS

286
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,900
RUINED AND THAT I CAN'T DO WHAT

287
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,067
I WANTED TO DO.

288
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:14,200
>> IT'S GONNA BE A LONG TIME

289
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,067
BEFORE YOU CAN DO WHAT YOU WANT

290
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:15,700
TO DO.

291
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,067
>> I KNOW THAT.

292
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:18,367
>> EVERYTHING'S CHANGED NOW.

293
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:20,067
>> I KNOW.

294
00:07:20,067 --> 00:07:21,933
>> MADISON, I'VE TOLD YOU FROM

295
00:07:21,933 --> 00:07:23,067
DAY ONE THAT I WOULD ALWAYS KICK

296
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:23,967
YOU OUT IF YOU EVER GOT PREGNANT

297
00:07:23,967 --> 00:07:25,567
AT 16.

298
00:07:25,567 --> 00:07:27,767
>> YEAH, WELL, THINGS HAPPEN,

299
00:07:27,767 --> 00:07:28,500
MOM.

300
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:29,667
THINGS CHANGE.

301
00:07:29,667 --> 00:07:31,567
>> I'M GIVING YOU A MONTH TO

302
00:07:31,567 --> 00:07:32,600
STAY HERE AFTER THE BABY'S BORN,

303
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,267
BECAUSE THAT'S THE HARDEST TIME.

304
00:07:34,267 --> 00:07:36,833
BUT AFTER THAT, YOU HAVE TO GO.

305
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,667
>> WHY?

306
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:39,667
>> BECAUSE THERE'S NO ROOM, AND

307
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:40,667
IT'S NOT FAIR TO EVERYBODY ELSE

308
00:07:40,667 --> 00:07:42,100
IN THE HOUSE.

309
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,400
WE HAVE TO GO WITH OUR OTHER

310
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,700
OPTIONS, AND THAT'S EITHER YOU

311
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,600
GOING DOWN TO LIVE WITH CODY

312
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:47,267
OR GOING DOWN TO LIVE

313
00:07:47,267 --> 00:07:48,067
WITH YOUR DAD.

314
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:49,300
>> I DON'T WANT TO GO TO CODY'S

315
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:50,200
OR DAD'S.

316
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,200
CODY AND I DON'T EVEN KNOW EACH

317
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,067
OTHER, AND THEN I'M GONNA HAVE

318
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:54,067
TO LIVE WITH HIM WITH A BABY?

319
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:55,100
>> MADISON, I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO

320
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:55,767
TELL YOU.

321
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,167
I DON'T HAVE THE ROOM FOR YOU.

322
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:58,533
>> YOU CAN MAKE ROOM.

323
00:07:58,533 --> 00:07:59,200
>> I CAN'T.

324
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,400
THAT WOULD BE SEVEN PEOPLE IN

325
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,467
THIS HOUSE.

326
00:08:01,467 --> 00:08:02,367
MADISON, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO

327
00:08:02,367 --> 00:08:03,933
CHOSE TO GROW UP SO FAST.

328
00:08:03,933 --> 00:08:05,133
>> I DIDN'T CHOOSE TO GET

329
00:08:05,133 --> 00:08:06,500
PREGNANT AT THIS AGE, MOM.

330
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,800
I DIDN'T PLAN IT.

331
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:10,067
BUT I CAN'T TAKE IT BACK.

332
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:12,067
[sniffles]

333
00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:16,867
>> [sighs]

334
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:30,100
>> IT REALLY SUCKS THAT MY MOM

335
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,067
IS KICKING ME OUT OF THE

336
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:31,667
HOUSE...

337
00:08:31,667 --> 00:08:32,767
[knock at door]

338
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,067
SO CODY'S COMING OVER TODAY TO

339
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:35,500
TALK ABOUT IT.

340
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,167
>> HEY.

341
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:38,167
>> HI.

342
00:08:41,067 --> 00:08:43,933
IT'S REALLY MESSY.

343
00:08:43,933 --> 00:08:45,233
>> YOUR BELLY BUTTON, LIKE--

344
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:46,267
>> NO, DO YOU WANT TO SEE IT?

345
00:08:46,267 --> 00:08:47,467
I KNOW YOU LOVE IT SO MUCH.

346
00:08:47,467 --> 00:08:48,367
LOOK AT HOW GROSS IT LOOKS.

347
00:08:48,367 --> 00:08:50,067
>> OH, MY GOD.

348
00:08:50,067 --> 00:08:52,433
>> THERE'S A BABY IN THERE.

349
00:08:52,433 --> 00:08:54,200
MY MOM BASICALLY SAID I CAN ONLY

350
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,400
LIVE WITH HER UNTIL A MONTH

351
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,900
AFTER THE BABY'S BORN.

352
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,133
>> WHAT?

353
00:08:58,133 --> 00:08:59,067
>> SO I DON'T REALLY KNOW WHAT

354
00:08:59,067 --> 00:09:01,133
I'M GONNA DO AFTER THAT.

355
00:09:04,233 --> 00:09:05,267
>> HOW AM I GONNA LIVE WITH YOU

356
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:06,600
AND, LIKE, SLEEP IN A SAME BED

357
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,500
AS YOU AND STUFF WHEN WE'RE NOT

358
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,733
TOGETHER?

359
00:09:08,733 --> 00:09:10,733
>> I'LL SLEEP ON THE FLOOR.

360
00:09:15,567 --> 00:09:18,333
>> I'M JUST SO STRESSED.

361
00:09:18,333 --> 00:09:19,067
>> I KNOW.

362
00:09:19,067 --> 00:09:19,800
YOU NEED TO CALM DOWN.

363
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,467
>> I CAN'T.

364
00:09:20,467 --> 00:09:24,367
NOTHING IS READY OR, LIKE, 100%,

365
00:09:24,367 --> 00:09:27,800
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

366
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:29,067
>> I JUST--I DON'T KNOW.

367
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:30,133
I WISH I COULD TAKE EVERYTHING

368
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:32,267
BACK, BUT I REALLY CAN'T.

369
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:33,600
IT'S GONNA WORK OUT.

370
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,967
>> YOU DON'T KNOW THAT, THOUGH.

371
00:09:34,967 --> 00:09:35,633
>> I DO KNOW THAT.

372
00:09:35,633 --> 00:09:36,833
>> NO, YOU DON'T.

373
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:39,700
>> IT'S GONNA BE FINE.

374
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:41,567
>> I CAN'T DO THIS BY MYSELF,

375
00:09:41,567 --> 00:09:42,367
CODY.

376
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:43,200
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

377
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,333
YOU'RE GOING TO.

378
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,833
WHEN I GET HOME, I'M GONNA TALK

379
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,100
TO MY PARENTS ABOUT YOU MOVING

380
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,800
IN.

381
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,167
MY MOM COULD BABYSIT.

382
00:09:50,167 --> 00:09:52,267
SHE WOULD LOVE IT.

383
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,433
>> EVEN THOUGH I BARELY KNOW

384
00:10:02,433 --> 00:10:04,133
CODY, I'M LEANING TOWARDS MOVING

385
00:10:04,133 --> 00:10:05,233
IN WITH HIM.

386
00:10:05,233 --> 00:10:07,167
BUT WHEN I TOLD MY DAD, HE DROVE

387
00:10:07,167 --> 00:10:08,933
AN HOUR FROM INDIANA SO WE COULD

388
00:10:08,933 --> 00:10:09,700
TALK.

389
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,633
>> HELLO.

390
00:10:10,633 --> 00:10:11,300
TWO, PLEASE.

391
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:14,300
>> SURE.

392
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,533
AND SHE'LL BE WITH YOU

393
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:16,533
IN JUST A MOMENT, OKAY?

394
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,333
>> OKAY, THANKS.

395
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,000
>> ENJOY.

396
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,467
>> THANK YOU.

397
00:10:19,467 --> 00:10:20,633
SO YOU'RE MOVING INTO A KID'S

398
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:22,000
HOUSE THAT YOU'VE ONLY KNOWN FOR

399
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,067
HOW LONG?

400
00:10:23,067 --> 00:10:24,133
>> NINE MONTHS.

401
00:10:24,133 --> 00:10:25,667
I'M NINE MONTHS PREGNANT, AND

402
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,967
I'VE KNOWN HIM FOR NINE MONTHS.

403
00:10:27,967 --> 00:10:29,433
>> IT'S NOT WHAT I HOPED WOULD

404
00:10:29,433 --> 00:10:30,433
HAPPEN FOR YA.

405
00:10:30,433 --> 00:10:31,300
>> I KNOW.

406
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,367
>> YOU THINK YOU DO, BUT YOU

407
00:10:32,367 --> 00:10:33,533
DON'T.

408
00:10:33,533 --> 00:10:34,433
YOU KNOW, IT'S A DIFFICULT

409
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,500
THING, AND YOU'LL SEE.

410
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:37,800
IN A FEW WEEKS, YOU'LL REALLY

411
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,000
SEE.

412
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,367
I MEAN, MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS,

413
00:10:41,367 --> 00:10:42,667
RUINED YOUR LIFE.

414
00:10:42,667 --> 00:10:44,100
AND I DON'T KNOW THE KID.

415
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,167
>> YEAH, WELL, I DON'T SEE

416
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:46,933
ANYTHING IN HIM.

417
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:47,800
IT'S JUST, I DON'T WANT MY

418
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,800
DAUGHTER TO GROW UP WITHOUT HER

419
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:49,500
DAD.

420
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,567
>> NO, AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

421
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:52,600
THE DAD BE, YOU KNOW, AROUND.

422
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:53,433
>> THAT'S THE ONLY THING.

423
00:10:53,433 --> 00:10:54,233
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON

424
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:54,867
I'M GOING THERE.

425
00:10:54,867 --> 00:10:55,600
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON

426
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,500
I'M STILL TALKING TO HIM.

427
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,033
BUT WE'RE NOT, LIKE, TOGETHER,

428
00:10:58,033 --> 00:10:58,867
SO...

429
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,767
I DON'T WANT TO LIVE DOWN THERE,

430
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:02,567
BUT I DON'T REALLY HAVE

431
00:11:02,567 --> 00:11:04,067
A CHOICE.

432
00:11:04,067 --> 00:11:05,267
I MEAN, I NEED HIS MOM TO BE

433
00:11:05,267 --> 00:11:06,267
ABLE TO BABYSIT SO I CAN GO TO

434
00:11:06,267 --> 00:11:07,400
SCHOOL AND WORK AND STUFF

435
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,833
SO I CAN EVENTUALLY MOVE OUT.

436
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:09,667
>> YEAH.

437
00:11:09,667 --> 00:11:10,833
>> SO...

438
00:11:10,833 --> 00:11:11,833
>> YOU'RE WELCOME TO MOVE IN

439
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,067
WITH US.

440
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:14,967
>> OH, I KNOW, BUT MY FRIENDS

441
00:11:14,967 --> 00:11:15,667
ARE GONNA BE FAR AWAY.

442
00:11:15,667 --> 00:11:16,533
I'M NOT EVEN GONNA GET TO SEE

443
00:11:16,533 --> 00:11:17,100
THEM.

444
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,767
SO I THINK I SHOULD TRY GOING TO

445
00:11:18,767 --> 00:11:20,767
CODY'S HOUSE.

446
00:11:22,367 --> 00:11:23,300
>> I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW IT'S

447
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,133
GONNA WORK.

448
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:25,633
>> I DON'T EITHER.

449
00:11:25,633 --> 00:11:27,533
AT ALL.

450
00:11:27,533 --> 00:11:28,833
I KNOW IT'S RISKY TO MOVE IN

451
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,767
WITH CODY, BUT I REALLY THINK

452
00:11:30,767 --> 00:11:32,167
IT'S THE BEST OPTION FOR ME AND

453
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:34,167
AUBREY.

454
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,067
I HAVE NO IDEA IF LIVING WITH

455
00:11:37,067 --> 00:11:38,300
CODY IS GOING TO WORK OUT OR

456
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,667
NOT, BUT HE AND HIS FAMILY ARE

457
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:42,167
COMING OVER TONIGHT TO DISCUSS

458
00:11:42,167 --> 00:11:43,167
THE DETAILS.

459
00:11:43,167 --> 00:11:44,600
[knock at door]

460
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,600
YOU CAN COME IN.

461
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:50,067
>> HELLO.

462
00:11:50,067 --> 00:11:52,367
I'M JENNIFER, MADISON'S MOM.

463
00:11:52,367 --> 00:11:53,800
>> SHE'S SO CUTE.

464
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,967
>> SO ARE YOU GUYS OKAY WITH HER

465
00:11:54,967 --> 00:11:55,933
MOVING IN A MONTH AFTER THE

466
00:11:55,933 --> 00:11:56,700
BABY'S BORN?

467
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,833
>> I'M OKAY IF SHE WANTED TO

468
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,167
MOVE IN NOW.

469
00:11:59,167 --> 00:12:00,067
>> [laughs]

470
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:00,900
>> HONESTLY, I MEAN, WHATEVER

471
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,200
SHE WANTS TO DO.

472
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,733
>> I MEAN, I KIND OF HAVE TO.

473
00:12:03,733 --> 00:12:04,933
>> IT'S NOT AN OPTION WITH HER

474
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,233
STAYING HERE, AND SHE DOESN'T

475
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:07,300
WANT TO GO TO HER DAD'S.

476
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,200
IT'S FAR.

477
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,667
>> IF SHE IS GONNA COME, WE CAN

478
00:12:09,667 --> 00:12:11,100
TURN THE DINING ROOM INTO THE

479
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:11,900
BABY'S ROOM.

480
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,067
SO IT'S NOT HUGE, BUT IT'LL BE

481
00:12:13,067 --> 00:12:14,133
A BEDROOM FOR HER.

482
00:12:14,133 --> 00:12:14,900
>> AND YOU GUYS ARE READY TO

483
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,400
JUST DO THAT, NO PROBLEMS?

484
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,633
>> NO PROBLEMS.

485
00:12:17,633 --> 00:12:19,200
MORE THAN WELCOME TO COME STAY

486
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,600
WITH US.

487
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,100
>> THEY JUST NEED TO SAVE THEIR

488
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,233
MONEY, YOU KNOW, JUST PUT THEIR

489
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:24,200
MONEY AWAY SO THEY--

490
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,067
>> I MEAN, I THINK THERE'S

491
00:12:25,067 --> 00:12:26,733
ALREADY, LIKE, OBSTACLES IN THE

492
00:12:26,733 --> 00:12:28,367
WAY FOR THEM MOVING IN TOGETHER,

493
00:12:28,367 --> 00:12:30,167
AS FAR AS--WELL, FIRST OF ALL,

494
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:31,333
THEY HARDLY KNOW EACH OTHER.

495
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:32,067
>> YES.

496
00:12:32,067 --> 00:12:33,533
>> BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE

497
00:12:33,533 --> 00:12:34,733
NOT GOING NOT GOING TO WORK OR,

498
00:12:34,733 --> 00:12:35,867
YOU KNOW...

499
00:12:35,867 --> 00:12:37,167
>> IT DEPENDS ON THEM, IF THEY

500
00:12:37,167 --> 00:12:38,333
WANTED TO MAKE IT WORK.

501
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,067
>> RIGHT.

502
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:40,067
>> I MEAN, ARE YOU WANTING TO BE

503
00:12:40,067 --> 00:12:41,067
WITH MADDY?

504
00:12:41,067 --> 00:12:41,733
>> YEAH.

505
00:12:41,733 --> 00:12:42,600
>> OR ARE YOU WANTING TO BE--

506
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:43,333
>> YEAH, I WANT TO BE WITH

507
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,733
MADDY, BUT I DON'T KNOW IF SHE

508
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:45,400
WANTS THAT.

509
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,167
BUT THAT'S WHAT I WANT.

510
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:48,167
>> I FEEL LIKE WE NEED TO GET TO

511
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:49,533
KNOW EACH OTHER MORE BEFORE THE

512
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:50,500
BABY'S HERE.

513
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:51,567
>> RIGHT, WHICH IS

514
00:12:51,567 --> 00:12:52,533
UNDERSTANDABLE, AND I THINK HE

515
00:12:52,533 --> 00:12:53,767
KNOWS THAT.

516
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:55,067
>> BUT EVEN IF I WASN'T WITH

517
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:56,967
CODY, I'D STILL LIVE THERE.

518
00:12:56,967 --> 00:12:58,933
>> SEE, SHE THINKS THAT SHE'D BE

519
00:12:58,933 --> 00:12:59,600
ABLE TO DO THAT.

520
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:00,600
WOULD YOU HONESTLY--WOULD YOU BE

521
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:01,267
ABLE TO DO THAT?

522
00:13:01,267 --> 00:13:02,167
>> AND YOU'D SLEEP IN THE SAME

523
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:02,733
BED TOGETHER?

524
00:13:02,733 --> 00:13:03,400
>> YEAH.

525
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,067
>> NO, I HAVE A BED.

526
00:13:04,067 --> 00:13:04,733
I COULD BRING MY BED.

527
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:05,633
>> AND YOU'RE ALL GONNA FIT IN

528
00:13:05,633 --> 00:13:06,267
HIS LITTLE ROOM?

529
00:13:06,267 --> 00:13:07,067
>> THE BABY WILL HAVE HER OWN

530
00:13:07,067 --> 00:13:08,167
ROOM.

531
00:13:08,167 --> 00:13:10,433
>> WELL...

532
00:13:10,433 --> 00:13:11,400
>> I THINK IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY

533
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,300
HARD.

534
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:15,333
>> IT WILL.

535
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,500
>> EVEN THOUGH I'M MOVING IN

536
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,667
WITH CODY, I'M NOT SURE

537
00:13:18,667 --> 00:13:20,733
HOW I FEEL ABOUT HIM.

538
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,733
[chime dings]

539
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:32,167
>> OH, MY GOD.

540
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:32,933
>> YOU NEED TO GET READY FOR

541
00:13:32,933 --> 00:13:33,567
SCHOOL.

542
00:13:33,567 --> 00:13:35,100
>> TODAY IS THE FIRST DAY OF MY

543
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:36,100
JUNIOR YEAR.

544
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,533
AND WITH EVERYTHING GOING ON,

545
00:13:37,533 --> 00:13:39,200
I REALLY DON'T FEEL UP TO IT.

546
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,667
[laughs]

547
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:41,533
>> ARE YOU EXCITED TO BE GOING

548
00:13:41,533 --> 00:13:42,200
BACK TO SCHOOL?

549
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,400
>> NO, NOT AT ALL.

550
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:44,467
>> WHY?

551
00:13:44,467 --> 00:13:45,233
>> WHY WOULD I BE?

552
00:13:45,233 --> 00:13:46,067
>> YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE

553
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:46,600
YOUR FRIENDS?

554
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:47,500
>> I DON'T WANT TO SEE EVERYONE

555
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,100
ELSE.

556
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,267
>> WHY?

557
00:13:49,267 --> 00:13:51,933
>> MOM, YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

558
00:13:51,933 --> 00:13:52,833
>> WHY WOULD YOU LET IT BOTHER

559
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:53,533
YOU?

560
00:13:53,533 --> 00:13:54,367
YOU'RE GOING TO SCHOOL.

561
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:55,167

00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:17,567
WHAT KID DO YOU KNOW HAS THEIR

749
00:18:17,567 --> 00:18:18,700
MOM'S LAST NAME?

750
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,633
THE DAD SHOULD HAVE THE LAST

751
00:18:19,633 --> 00:18:20,500
NAME IF HE'S GONNA BE IN THE

752
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:21,233
KID'S LIFE.

753
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:22,467
I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S THE

754
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:23,133
BIG DEAL.

755
00:18:23,133 --> 00:18:23,867
>> NO, THAT'S NOT HOW

756
00:18:23,867 --> 00:18:24,467
THAT WORKS.

757
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:25,367
SO IF SHE DOESN'T HAVE YOUR LAST

758
00:18:25,367 --> 00:18:26,267
NAME, YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE IN HER

759
00:18:26,267 --> 00:18:27,167
LIFE?

760
00:18:27,167 --> 00:18:28,200
>> THAT'S NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.

761
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,167
I'M SAYING, 'CAUSE I AM IN HER

762
00:18:29,167 --> 00:18:30,367
LIFE, I SHOULD HAVE THE LAST

763
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:31,333
NAME.

764
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:32,067
>> NO.

765
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:34,567
>> IT'S REALLY MAKING ME MAD.

766
00:18:34,567 --> 00:18:35,667
>> I'M NOT GONNA FIGHT WITH YOU

767
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:37,333
OVER IT.

768
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,700
>> THAT'S MESSED UP.

769
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,533
I THINK THAT'S, LIKE,

770
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:41,967
DISRESPECTFUL.

771
00:18:41,967 --> 00:18:42,967
>> I DON'T WANT YOU TO EXPECT US

772
00:18:42,967 --> 00:18:43,633
TO BE TOGETHER THEN

773
00:18:43,633 --> 00:18:44,500
IF YOU'RE GONNA BE LIKE THAT

774
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,100
WHEN I MOVE IN.

775
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:45,867
DON'T EXPECT SOMETHING.

776
00:18:45,867 --> 00:18:48,067
>> WELL, I'M JUST SAYING.

777
00:19:05,633 --> 00:19:07,133
>> TODAY IS HOMECOMING, BUT

778
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:08,233
SINCE CODY AND I ARE FIGHTING

779
00:19:08,233 --> 00:19:09,733
ABOUT THE BABY'S LAST NAME,

780
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:11,467
I'M NOT FEELING UP FOR IT.

781
00:19:11,467 --> 00:19:12,733
BUT I STILL AGREED TO TRY ON

782
00:19:12,733 --> 00:19:15,700
DRESSES WITH MY FRIEND.

783
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:16,567
>> HEY.

784
00:19:16,567 --> 00:19:18,367
>> HI.

785
00:19:18,367 --> 00:19:19,967
THIS IS A SIZE 11.

786
00:19:19,967 --> 00:19:20,733
>> REALLY?

787
00:19:20,733 --> 00:19:22,133
>> THAT'S TEN SIZES HIGHER THAN

788
00:19:22,133 --> 00:19:22,967
I'M USUALLY IN.

789
00:19:22,967 --> 00:19:23,767
>> OH, MY GOD.

790
00:19:23,767 --> 00:19:24,633
>> ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA GO TRY

791
00:19:24,633 --> 00:19:25,233
ON THIS ONE.

792
00:19:25,233 --> 00:19:27,067
>> OKAY.

793
00:19:27,067 --> 00:19:28,133
>> I CAN'T EVEN GET IT ON.

794
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:30,733
>> SERIOUSLY?

795
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:33,200
>> YOU WANT ME TO PULL IT DOWN?

796
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,300
>> OH, GOD, THINGS ARE RIPPING.

797
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,300
>> [laughs]

798
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,600
IF YOU WEREN'T PREGNANT,

799
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,300
THIS WOULD BE TEN TIMES EASIER.

800
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:41,367
>> FOR YOU?

801
00:19:41,367 --> 00:19:43,533
>> FOR EVERYONE.

802
00:19:43,533 --> 00:19:45,400
LIFT THE DRESS UP A LITTLE BIT.

803
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,867
>> DON'T RIP MY BELLY RING OUT.

804
00:19:46,867 --> 00:19:47,833
>> I'M NOT RIPPING YOUR BELLY

805
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:48,600
RING.

806
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,433
JEEZ.

807
00:19:49,433 --> 00:19:50,667
SUCK IN.

808
00:19:50,667 --> 00:19:51,833
>> I CAN'T SUCK IN.

809
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:54,533
[laughter]

810
00:19:54,533 --> 00:19:55,567
>> SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO

811
00:19:55,567 --> 00:19:56,233
ABOUT HOMECOMING?

812
00:19:56,233 --> 00:19:57,633
ARE YOU GONNA GO?

813
00:19:57,633 --> 00:19:58,333
>> NO.

814
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,333
I JUST KIND OF WANT TO SLEEP.

815
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,733
OH, YEAH, THAT'S NOT HAPPENING.

816
00:20:03,733 --> 00:20:05,000
OKAY.

817
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,333
>> JUST NOT FEELING IT?

818
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:09,133
>> YEAH. I HATE THIS DRESS.

819
00:20:09,133 --> 00:20:10,600
I WAS WAY TOO UNCOMFORTABLE TO

820
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,433
GO TO THE DANCE, SO SKIPPED IT.

821
00:20:13,433 --> 00:20:14,567
[chime dings]

822
00:20:14,567 --> 00:20:16,700
BUT THE NEXT DAY, CODY TEXTED ME

823
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:18,267
TO APOLOGIZE FOR FIGHTING ON OUR

824
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:19,267
DATE.

825
00:20:19,267 --> 00:20:20,600
HE STILL HOPES I GIVE THE BABY

826
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,367
HIS LAST NAME, BUT HE DOESN'T

827
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:23,367
WANT TO STRESS ME OUT BY

828
00:20:23,367 --> 00:20:25,367
ARGUING, SO I'M GOING OVER TO

829
00:20:25,367 --> 00:20:26,767
HIS HOUSE TO SEE THE PLANS FOR

830
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,367
BUILDING AUBREY'S NURSERY.

831
00:20:29,367 --> 00:20:30,900
>> SO YOU WANT TO SHOW HER WHAT

832
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,433
YOU GUYS FIGURED OUT WITH THE

833
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:33,533
ROOM?

834
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:34,333
>> ALL RIGHT, THE WALL'S

835
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,167
GONNA COME FROM RIGHT HERE

836
00:20:36,167 --> 00:20:37,867
ALL THE WAY OUT TO THE EDGE OF

837
00:20:37,867 --> 00:20:38,567
THIS WINDOW HERE.

838
00:20:38,567 --> 00:20:39,700
IT'S GONNA SQUARE OFF RIGHT

839
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:40,833
HERE, OKAY?

840
00:20:40,833 --> 00:20:41,833
AND THEN THE DOOR WILL COME

841
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,200
RIGHT HERE.

842
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,367
>> BUT THAT'S GONNA BE, LIKE,

843
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:45,033
AN AWKWARD LITTLE THING

844
00:20:45,033 --> 00:20:45,700
RIGHT THERE.

845
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,533
>> THE FRIDGE ISN'T GONNA BE

846
00:20:46,533 --> 00:20:47,133
HERE.

847
00:20:47,133 --> 00:20:48,367
THE FRIDGE HAS TO GO OVER THERE,

848
00:20:48,367 --> 00:20:49,300
WHICH IS GONNA LOOK STUPID,

849
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:49,967
BUT--

850
00:20:49,967 --> 00:20:50,700
>> YEAH, THIS WILL BE OPEN

851
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,333
RIGHT HERE.

852
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,000
>> YEAH.

853
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:52,833
>> SO THE DRESSER WOULD HAVE TO

854
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,200
BE HERE, AND ON EACH SIDE,

855
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,433
THERE WOULD BE THREE RECESSED

856
00:20:55,433 --> 00:20:56,533
SHELVING, THREE--

857
00:20:56,533 --> 00:20:57,500
>> THAT GOES INTO THE WALL.

858
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,600
>> THEY GO INTO THE WALL ON EACH

859
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,667
SIDE SO YOU COULD PUT LOTIONS,

860
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:02,567
POWDERS, WHATEVER BABY STUFF YOU

861
00:21:02,567 --> 00:21:03,400
NEED, SINCE IT'S GONNA BE

862
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:05,133
A CHANGING AREA.

863
00:21:05,133 --> 00:21:06,967
AND THEN, ABOVE IT, YOU WOULD

864
00:21:06,967 --> 00:21:08,867
HAVE, LIKE, A RECESSED, DIM

865
00:21:08,867 --> 00:21:10,633
LIGHTING, SO WHEN YOU GET UP IN

866
00:21:10,633 --> 00:21:11,367
THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT TO

867
00:21:11,367 --> 00:21:12,300
CHANGE HER, YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO

868
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,167
TURN ON THE BIG LIGHT.

869
00:21:13,167 --> 00:21:14,067
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE COOLEST

870
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:15,333
IDEA.

871
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,933
BUT IF YOU DON'T WANT IT,

872
00:21:16,933 --> 00:21:18,300
YOU NEED TO FIGURE IT OUT, LIKE,

873
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,400
TODAY, BECAUSE LOTS OF MONEY

874
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,100
PUT OUT.

875
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:22,167
BUT WE WANT TO DO IT.

876
00:21:22,167 --> 00:21:23,067
WE WANT TO DO IT 'CAUSE WE WANT

877
00:21:23,067 --> 00:21:24,733
YOU GUYS HERE AND STUFF, BUT

878
00:21:24,733 --> 00:21:25,733
JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE

879
00:21:25,733 --> 00:21:26,467
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

880
00:21:26,467 --> 00:21:27,600
>> I THINK I NEED WALLS TO BE UP

881
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:28,667
FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO PICTURE

882
00:21:28,667 --> 00:21:29,333
EVERYTHING.

883
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:30,400
>> THEY WILL BE TOMORROW.

884
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,933
>> THEY WILL BE TOMORROW NIGHT.

885
00:21:31,933 --> 00:21:34,067
>> OKAY.

886
00:21:34,067 --> 00:21:35,133
>> I CAN'T WAIT.

887
00:21:35,133 --> 00:21:36,167
I HOPE THE NEXT COUPLE MONTHS

888
00:21:36,167 --> 00:21:37,833
GO BY FAST.

889
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,067
>> I'M GLAD CODY'S PARENTS ARE

890
00:21:39,067 --> 00:21:41,133
EXCITED, BUT SEEING AUBREY'S

891
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:43,067
ROOM IN THEIR HOUSE IS REALLY

892
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:45,067
WEIRDING ME OUT.

893
00:21:52,867 --> 00:21:54,233
BUT BEFORE I COULD FIGURE IT

894
00:21:54,233 --> 00:21:56,100
OUT, I STARTED HAVING

895
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,967
CONTRACTIONS.

896
00:21:57,967 --> 00:21:58,867
>> YOU ALL RIGHT?

897
00:21:58,867 --> 00:21:59,533
>> NO.

898
00:21:59,533 --> 00:22:01,167
>> OKAY.

899
00:22:01,167 --> 00:22:04,300
YOU THINK IT'S CONTRACTIONS?

900
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:05,633
>> I JUST THINK WE SHOULD GO.

901
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:06,467
>> ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA GET

902
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:07,400
ALYSSA'S COAT ON, THEN WE'RE

903
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,233
GONNA GO TO THE HOSPITAL, OKAY?

904
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:10,067
>> OKAY.

905
00:22:17,233 --> 00:22:19,233
>> THEN BREATHE THROUGH THEM.

906
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,267
ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

907
00:22:23,267 --> 00:22:26,067
CAREFUL.

908
00:22:26,067 --> 00:22:28,067
CAREFUL.

909
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,200
CAREFUL GOING DOWN THE STAIRS.

910
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:34,133
YOU ALL RIGHT?

911
00:22:34,133 --> 00:22:34,900
>> NO.

912
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,900
GET THIS BABY OUT OF ME.

913
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,533
I TEXTED CODY ON THE WAY TO THE

914
00:22:49,533 --> 00:22:53,067
HOSPITAL, AND HE MET ME THERE.

915
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:54,967
OH, MY GOD.

916
00:22:54,967 --> 00:22:56,267
EVEN THOUGH I'M REALLY CONFUSED

917
00:22:56,267 --> 00:22:57,900
ABOUT HIM RIGHT NOW, I'M GLAD HE

918
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,900
SHOWED UP.

919
00:23:07,933 --> 00:23:09,767
I JUST WANT IT TO STOP.

920
00:23:09,767 --> 00:23:11,167
MOM...

921
00:23:11,167 --> 00:23:13,467
[mumbling indistinctly]

922
00:23:13,467 --> 00:23:15,467
[moaning]

923
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:22,367
>> NO, NO, NO, NO.

924
00:23:28,567 --> 00:23:31,100
[moaning]

925
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,100
I'M GONNA DIE.

926
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,367
THE PAIN GOT SO BAD THAT I HAD

927
00:23:38,367 --> 00:23:40,700
TO GET AN EPIDURAL.

928
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,500
AND AFTER THAT,

929
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,300
THINGS MOVED PRETTY FAST.

930
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,833
A FEW PUSHES LATER,

931
00:23:45,833 --> 00:23:47,833
AND AUBREY WAS BORN.

932
00:23:54,367 --> 00:23:56,667
>> * FATE HAS BROUGHT US HERE

933
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:58,233
* AND I'VE NEVER BEEN *

934
00:23:58,233 --> 00:24:01,967

>> EVEN THOUGH I'LL STILL BE

1331
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:44,300
WITH FAMILY, IT WAS REALLY HARD

1332
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:45,567
MOVING OUT OF MY MOM'S HOUSE

1333
00:36:45,567 --> 00:36:46,933
SINCE I'LL BE SO FAR AWAY

1334
00:36:46,933 --> 00:36:48,933
FROM EVERYONE.

1335
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,800
I'VE SETTLED INTO MY DAD'S

1336
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,067
HOUSE, BUT SINCE HE WORKS

1337
00:36:54,067 --> 00:36:55,733
FULL-TIME, I'M USUALLY HOME BY

1338
00:36:55,733 --> 00:36:59,233
MYSELF TAKING CARE OF AUBREY...

1339
00:36:59,233 --> 00:37:00,833
AUBREY, YOU'RE NOT EVEN DOING

1340
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:01,867
ANYTHING.

1341
00:37:01,867 --> 00:37:03,867
SO I WAS GLAD WHEN CODY TEXTED

1342
00:37:03,867 --> 00:37:05,067
ME THAT HE WANTS TO SEE HIS

1343
00:37:05,067 --> 00:37:07,067
DAUGHTER.

00:37:12,533 --> 00:37:14,367
WHO'S HERE?

1346
00:37:14,367 --> 00:37:16,067
HI.

1347
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:18,533
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.

[Aubrey cries]

1349
00:37:19,633 --> 00:37:21,633
OH...

1350
00:37:23,133 --> 00:37:24,467
IS THIS, LIKE, YOUR ROOM?

1351
00:37:24,467 --> 00:37:25,400
>> YEAH.

1352
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,100
>> IT'S NICE.

1353
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:28,100
>> I KNOW. IT'S SO BIG.

1354
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:32,667
SHE GOT THE HICCUPS.

1355
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:33,633
SHE MIGHT GET PISSED OFF.

1356
00:37:33,633 --> 00:37:34,633
SHE CAN HOLD HER HEAD UP KIND

1357
00:37:34,633 --> 00:37:35,933
OF, SO YOU DON'T GOT TO HOLD HER

1358
00:37:35,933 --> 00:37:38,200
LIKE A TINY LITTLE BABY.

1359
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:39,400
>> HEY.

1360
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:40,833
[chuckles]

1361
00:37:40,833 --> 00:37:42,433
IT FEELS GOOD TO FINALLY SEE

1362
00:37:42,433 --> 00:37:43,333
HER.

1363
00:37:43,333 --> 00:37:45,467
>> YEAH, BUT SHE'S ALMOST TWO

1364
00:37:45,467 --> 00:37:46,600
MONTHS OLD, AND YOU'VE ONLY SEEN

1365
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,767
HER TWICE.

1366
00:37:47,767 --> 00:37:49,500
>> YEAH, IT'S HARD WITH WORK

1367
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:50,533
AND EVERYTHING.

1368
00:37:50,533 --> 00:37:52,900
I GOT TWO JOBS.

1369
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,267
>> YEAH, MINE'S A FULL-TIME JOB

1370
00:37:54,267 --> 00:37:55,633
EVERY SECOND OF THE DAY, SO...

1371
00:37:55,633 --> 00:37:56,800
>> YEAH, I KNOW, BUT, LIKE--

1372
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:57,633
[Aubrey cries]

1373
00:37:57,633 --> 00:37:58,767
>> OH...

1374
00:37:58,767 --> 00:37:59,733
I NEED TO FEED HER.

1375
00:37:59,733 --> 00:38:01,200
I NEED TO FEED HER.

1376
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:02,567
SHE'S GOT THE HICCUPS.

1377
00:38:02,567 --> 00:38:03,400
WE GOT TO GET RID OF THE

1378
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,633
HICCUPS.

1379
00:38:04,633 --> 00:38:07,733
OH, HEY.

1380
00:38:07,733 --> 00:38:11,667
I'M GETTING IT.

1381
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:12,567
>> WHAT MADE YOU CHANGE YOUR

1382
00:38:12,567 --> 00:38:15,067
MIND ABOUT MOVING IN?

1383
00:38:15,067 --> 00:38:16,500
>> WELL, I MEAN, WE DIDN'T

1384
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,633
REALLY KNOW EACH OTHER IN THE

1385
00:38:17,633 --> 00:38:19,400
FIRST PLACE, SO I WAS JUST KIND

1386
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,867
OF WITH YOU BECAUSE I WAS

1387
00:38:20,867 --> 00:38:22,067
PREGNANT AND I WANTED OUR LITTLE

1388
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:23,400
FAMILY JUST TO, LIKE,

1389
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,300
BE TOGETHER.

1390
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:25,533
>> YEAH, BUT YOU COULD'VE TOLD

1391
00:38:25,533 --> 00:38:27,067
MY MOM THAT, LIKE, A WHILE AGO,

1392
00:38:27,067 --> 00:38:28,133
'CAUSE, LIKE, YOU KNOW, YOU GOT

1393
00:38:28,133 --> 00:38:29,433
HER ALL HYPED UP.

1394
00:38:29,433 --> 00:38:30,900
>> YEAH, I FELT BAD, BUT I

1395
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,667
DIDN'T SEE A POINT IN ME BEING

1396
00:38:32,667 --> 00:38:34,100
MISERABLE THE ENTIRE TIME I WAS

1397
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:34,900
THERE.

1398
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,767
SO YOU JUST HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

1399
00:38:36,767 --> 00:38:38,667
THAT IF AUBREY WASN'T IN THE

1400
00:38:38,667 --> 00:38:39,933
PICTURE, THEN WE WOULD NOT

1401
00:38:39,933 --> 00:38:41,067
EVEN HAVE A RELATIONSHIP

1402
00:38:41,067 --> 00:38:43,133
OR BE TALKING OR ANYTHING.

1403
00:38:43,133 --> 00:38:44,467
>> YEAH, BUT I WANT TO START,

1404
00:38:44,467 --> 00:38:45,700
LIKE, SEEING HER MORE, THOUGH.

1405
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,333
SHE'S GONNA NEED HER DAD TOO.

1406
00:38:47,333 --> 00:38:48,133
>> YEAH, YOU CAN SEE HER

1407
00:38:48,133 --> 00:38:48,800
WHENEVER YOU WANT.

1408
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,733
I'M NOT TELLING YOU YOU CAN'T

1409
00:38:49,733 --> 00:38:50,300
COME HERE.

1410
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,167
>> YEAH, WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

1411
00:38:51,167 --> 00:38:52,067
I DON'T KNOW IF I FEEL EVEN

1412
00:38:52,067 --> 00:38:53,367
COMFORTABLE COMING HERE.

1413
00:38:53,367 --> 00:38:55,167
LIKE, YOUR DAD I DON'T THINK

1414
00:38:55,167 --> 00:38:56,067
LIKES ME AND--

1415
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:57,067
>> MY DAD HAS NO PROBLEM

1416
00:38:57,067 --> 00:38:57,667
WITH YOU.

1417
00:38:57,667 --> 00:38:59,167
HE UNDERSTANDS, LIKE,

1418
00:38:59,167 --> 00:39:00,067
IT'S YOUR DAUGHTER.

1419
00:39:00,067 --> 00:39:01,500
YOU'RE GONNA COME SEE HER.

1420
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,133
>> WELL, WE'RE STUCK WITH EACH

1421
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:05,100
OTHER FOR A GOOD 18 YEARS,

1422
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,933
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO, LIKE,

1423
00:39:06,933 --> 00:39:08,567
WORK SOMETHING OUT.

1424
00:39:08,567 --> 00:39:09,600
>> YEAH.

1425
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,600
>> IT'S ALL ABOUT AUBREY NOW.

1426
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,867
>> I MEAN, I NEVER WANTED AUBREY

1427
00:39:15,867 --> 00:39:18,067
TO GROW UP WITHOUT BOTH OF HER

1428
00:39:18,067 --> 00:39:19,767
PARENTS.

1429
00:39:19,767 --> 00:39:21,767
>> * I WAS STUCK IN THE GROUND

BUT THEN I REALIZED, LIKE,

1435
00:39:35,667 --> 00:39:37,067
I CAN'T BE WITH SOMEONE JUST

1436
00:39:37,067 --> 00:39:38,800
BECAUSE I HAVE A BABY WITH HIM.

1437
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:39,900
I HAVE TO ACTUALLY HAVE FEELINGS

1438
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:41,067
FOR HIM.

1439
00:39:41,067 --> 00:39:42,467

00:39:57,067 --> 00:39:58,600
I'D STILL BE LIVING AT HOME.

1449
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:00,167

IT'S JUST, EVERYTHING CHANGED

1456
00:40:10,067 --> 00:40:11,767
SINCE I GOT PREGNANT.

1457
00:40:11,767 --> 00:40:15,033
IT'S A STRUGGLE, AND IT'S HARD.

1458
00:40:15,033 --> 00:40:17,367
I WANT AUBREY TO GROW UP

1459
00:40:17,367 --> 00:40:19,333
AND MAKE SMART DECISIONS

1460
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:21,433
AND JUST LEARN FROM MY MISTAKES.
