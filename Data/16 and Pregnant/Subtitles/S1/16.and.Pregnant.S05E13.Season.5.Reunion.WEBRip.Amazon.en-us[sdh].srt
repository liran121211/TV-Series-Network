00:00:38,033 --> 00:00:38,900
OF THE PHYSICAL,

15
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,800

JORDAN, AND SAVANNAH.

24
00:01:03,967 --> 00:01:05,333
CHILDREN OF TEEN PARENTS

25
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:06,067
ARE MORE LIKELY

26
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:07,533
TO BECOME TEEN PARENTS.

27
00:01:07,533 --> 00:01:08,300
ARIANNA'S MOTHER

28
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,800
HAD HER WHEN SHE WAS JUST 17,

29
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,200
AND NOW ARIANNA IS A TEEN MOM.

30
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,867
LET'S LOOK BACK

31
00:01:12,867 --> 00:01:13,900
ON HER EXPERIENCE

32
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,800
ON 16 AND PREGNANT. 

33
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,833
>> YOU BEING SORRY.

34
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:19,700
DON'T BE LIKE MY DAD.

35
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:20,600
I'M NOT GOING TO BE THE ONLY ONE

36
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,933
TAKING CARE OF HIM FINANCIALLY.

37
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:22,600
YOU GOT TO OWN UP

38
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,533
TO WHAT YOU DID WRONG.

39
00:01:23,533 --> 00:01:24,400
>> YOU CAN BE WRONG TOO.

40
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,300
>> YOU'RE GETTING ON BY [bleep]

41
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:26,100
NERVES.

42
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,500
I'M LEAVING.

43
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:28,700
I DON'T WANT YOU AROUND ME

44
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:29,533
BECAUSE YOU NEED TO BE MAN

45
00:01:29,533 --> 00:01:30,200
ENOUGH TO KNOW

46
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:30,867
WHAT YOU DID WRONG.

47
00:01:30,867 --> 00:01:34,367
>> I WILL CALL A NURSE IN HERE

48
00:01:34,367 --> 00:01:35,533
IF YOU DO NOT GIVE ME MY CHILD

49
00:01:35,533 --> 00:01:36,200
AND GET

50
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,700
OUT OF MY ROOM RIGHT NOW.

51
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,233
I'M DOING WHAT I'VE GOT TO DO.

52
00:01:40,233 --> 00:01:41,533
IT'S YOUR TURN.

53
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:42,600
AND IF THIS CONTINUES--

54
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,267
>> ALL RIGHT.

55
00:01:43,267 --> 00:01:48,667
>> WELL, WHATEVER.

56
00:01:48,667 --> 00:01:49,700
>> WELL ARIANNA

57
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,067
IS HERE WITH MAURICE.

58
00:01:51,067 --> 00:01:52,067
ARIANNA, WHEN WAS THE LAST TIME

59
00:01:52,067 --> 00:01:52,700
YOU SAW MAURICE?

60
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,367
>> ABOUT THREE

61
00:01:53,367 --> 00:01:54,167
AND A HALF MONTHS AGO.

62
00:01:54,167 --> 00:01:55,200
>> THREE AND A HALF MONTHS AGO?

63
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,067
>> YES.

64
00:01:56,067 --> 00:01:57,600
>> HAVE YOU NOT WANTED

65
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,400
TO SPEAK TO HIM OR NO?

66
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,233
>> NO, I'VE GIVEN MORE CHANCES

67
00:02:01,233 --> 00:02:02,133
THAN I CAN COUNT ON MY HANDS

68
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:03,167
AND TOES.

69
00:02:03,167 --> 00:02:05,833
AND IT'S JUST NEVER ENOUGH,

70
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:06,933
THE CHANCES THAT I GIVE HIM.

71
00:02:06,933 --> 00:02:07,800
SO AFTER GIVING

72
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,533
HIM SO MANY CHANCES,

73
00:02:08,533 --> 00:02:09,533
YOU CAN'T FORCE SOMEBODY

74
00:02:09,533 --> 00:02:11,167
TO BE A FATHER.

75
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:12,600
IT HAS TO COME NATURALLY.

76
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,767
>> AND WHEN YOU SAY BE A FATHER,

77
00:02:13,767 --> 00:02:14,600
WHAT WOULD THAT LOOK LIKE?

78
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:16,300
WHAT DO YOU WANT HIM TO DO?

79
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:18,333
>> YOU CAN'T BE A FATHER

80
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:19,300
OR A PARENT

81
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,600
WHENEVER YOU FEEL LIKE IT.

82
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,333
YOU CAN'T BE A REVOLVING DOOR.

83
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:24,233
IT CAN'T BE, YOU KNOW,

84
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:25,600
WHENEVER YOU FEEL LIKE IT

85
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:27,133
AND THAT'S HOW IT WAS.

86
00:02:27,133 --> 00:02:27,867
>> ALL RIGHT, MAURICE.

87
00:02:27,867 --> 00:02:30,167
HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO THAT?

88
00:02:30,167 --> 00:02:31,633
>> WELL, I MEAN,

89
00:02:31,633 --> 00:02:34,100
I WANTED TO BE THERE FOR MY SON,

90
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:36,067
BUT I CAN'T BE THERE FOR HIM

91
00:02:36,067 --> 00:02:37,367
IF I'M NOT ALLOWED TO.

92
00:02:37,367 --> 00:02:38,067
>> NOT ALLOWED TO?

93
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:38,700
>> YEAH.

94
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,400
I MEAN, THERE'S BEEN

95
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,167
PLENTY OF OPPORTUNITIES

96
00:02:40,167 --> 00:02:41,167
WHERE I WANTED TO COME

97
00:02:41,167 --> 00:02:42,367
BY TO COME SEE HIM,

98
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:45,233
COME PICK MY SON UP, YOU KNOW,

99
00:02:45,233 --> 00:02:46,400
"YOU CAN'T PICK UP YOUR SON.

100
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,833
YOU CAN'T COME OVER HERE.

101
00:02:47,833 --> 00:02:49,200
DON'T CONTACT MY PHONE NO MORE.

102
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,167
YOU CAN'T TALK TO US."

103
00:02:51,167 --> 00:02:54,333
I CAN'T BE THERE FOR MY SON

104
00:02:54,333 --> 00:02:57,100
IF I'M NOT EVEN ALLOWED TO.

105
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,167
I DON'T HAVE RIGHTS TO MY SON.

106
00:02:58,167 --> 00:02:59,733
I'M NOT ON THE BIRTH

107
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:00,467
CERTIFICATE.

108
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:02,800
IT'S NOT LIKE I CAN GO

109
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,467
OVER THERE

110
00:03:03,467 --> 00:03:04,133
AND PICK HIM UP

111
00:03:04,133 --> 00:03:05,233
WHETHER SHE SAY SO OR NOT,

112
00:03:05,233 --> 00:03:06,667
YOU KNOW?

113
00:03:06,667 --> 00:03:07,467
>> ARIANNA?

114
00:03:07,467 --> 00:03:08,667
>> HE'S FULL OF CRAP.

115
00:03:08,667 --> 00:03:09,333
>> SHE CAN'T EVEN

116
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:10,067
LOOK AT YOU NOW.

117
00:03:10,067 --> 00:03:11,133
>> EXACTLY.

118
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:12,167
SHE WON'T LOOK AT MY FACE.

119
00:03:12,167 --> 00:03:12,967
>> BECAUSE I'M DISGUSTED

120
00:03:12,967 --> 00:03:13,567
WITH HIM.

121
00:03:13,567 --> 00:03:14,400
>> YOU CAN'T LOOK SOMEBODY

122
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:14,967
IN THE EYE. WHY?

123
00:03:14,967 --> 00:03:15,833
>> WHY ARE YOU DISGUSTED?

124
00:03:15,833 --> 00:03:16,500
>> BECAUSE HE'S

125
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,167
A DEADBEAT FATHER.

126
00:03:18,167 --> 00:03:19,267
>> I'M A DEADBEAT FATHER, BUT

127
00:03:19,267 --> 00:03:20,400
I'M NOT ALLOWED TO COME SEE MY

128
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,067
SON.

129
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:21,833
I'M A DEADBEAT FATHER,

130
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,667
BUT I DONE BROUGHT OVER PLENTY.

131
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:24,700
SO I'M A DEADBEAT FATHER,

132
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,533
BUT I GOT A CREDIT UNION

133
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:26,200
AND EVERYTHING SET UP.

134
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:27,567
HE'S GOT $3,200 DOLLARS

135
00:03:27,567 --> 00:03:28,600
TO HIS NAME RIGHT NOW.

136
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,100
>> NO, HE DOESN'T BRING ANYTHING

137
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,767
FOR MY SON.

138
00:03:30,767 --> 00:03:31,533
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU--

139
00:03:31,533 --> 00:03:32,900
>> I TOOK $3,200 DOLLARS CASH

140
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,567
OUT OF MY POCKET,

141
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:34,233
FROM MY LAWYER.

142
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:35,067
>> I DIDN'T COME ON HERE

143
00:03:35,067 --> 00:03:35,600
TO ARGUE WITH HIM.

144
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,300
>> WHY IS THERE A LAWYER

145
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:36,900
INVOLVED?

146
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,600
>> A LAWYER IS INVOLVED

147
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:38,300
BECAUSE I CAN'T EVEN

148
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,533
COME TO THE RESIDENCE

149
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:40,367
TO SEE MY SON.

150
00:03:40,367 --> 00:03:41,400
>> THAT'S A LIE.

151
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,200
>> TO GET VISITATION OR CUSTODY.

152
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,233
>> TO GET CUSTODY OF MY SON--

153
00:03:45,233 --> 00:03:46,067
>> NO, THAT'LL NEVER HAPPEN.

154
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:46,767
>> SO I CAN TAKE MY SON

155
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:47,367
TO MY FAMILY

156
00:03:47,367 --> 00:03:48,833
BECAUSE HE'S MY SON.

157
00:03:48,833 --> 00:03:50,200
HE'S SUPPOSED TO SEE MY SIDE

158
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:50,867
OF THE FAMILY.

159
00:03:50,867 --> 00:03:51,567
>> DID YOU GET A LETTER

160
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:52,200
FROM A LAWYER?

161
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:52,867
>> NO.

162
00:03:52,867 --> 00:03:54,100
>> SHE DIDN'T GET A LETTER.

163
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:54,800
>> I'M PRETTY SURE

164
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,433
SHE GOT A LETTER

165
00:03:55,433 --> 00:03:56,100
BECAUSE I GOT

166
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:56,767
MINE YESTERDAY.

167
00:03:56,767 --> 00:03:57,567
>> DEFINITELY DIDN'T GET

168
00:03:57,567 --> 00:03:58,133
A LETTER.

169
00:03:58,133 --> 00:03:58,833
>> I CAN CALL MY LAWYER

170
00:03:58,833 --> 00:03:59,600
RIGHT NOW ON TV, RIGHT NOW.

171
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:00,367
>> WOULDN'T YOU SAY

172
00:04:00,367 --> 00:04:01,100
IT IS RESPONSIBLE OF HIM

173
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,633
TO WANT TO GET FORMAL CUSTODY

174
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:03,567
OR VISITATION THAT'S

175
00:04:03,567 --> 00:04:04,600
A STRUCTURED, REASONABLE--

176
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,333
>> MY SON IS SIX MONTHS OLD.

177
00:04:06,333 --> 00:04:07,800
IF HE REALLY LOVED MY SON,

178
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,533
THIS WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE

179
00:04:08,533 --> 00:04:10,233
A LONG TIME AGO.

180
00:04:10,233 --> 00:04:11,400
>> IT SEEMS LIKE,

181
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,900
ASIDE FROM YOUR RAGE, RIGHT?

182
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,100
YOUR RAGE, YOUR DISGUST,

183
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:16,933
AND THE OTHER THING

184
00:04:16,933 --> 00:04:18,433
IS SORT OF RESENTMENT TOO.

185
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:19,633
IT SEEMS LIKE, IN YOUR EPISODE,

186
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:20,700
THE RESENTMENT STARTED WHEN HE

187
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,067
ASKED YOU FOR A PATERNITY TEST.

188
00:04:23,067 --> 00:04:26,167
>> I WAS CONFUSED AS TO WHY.

189
00:04:26,167 --> 00:04:26,867
>> WELL, LET'S GET

190
00:04:26,867 --> 00:04:27,833
TO STRAIGHTEN THAT OUT.

191
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:28,967
WHY THE PATERNITY TEST?

192
00:04:28,967 --> 00:04:29,633
>> I ASKED HER

193
00:04:29,633 --> 00:04:30,767
FOR THE PATERNITY TEST

194
00:04:30,767 --> 00:04:31,733
FOR THE CLARIFICATION

195
00:04:31,733 --> 00:04:32,400
FOR MY FAMILY.

196
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,067
>> YOUR FAMILY.

197
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:34,867
THEY DIDN'T BUY IT. OKAY.

198
00:04:34,867 --> 00:04:36,100
>> DID YOU GET A PATERNITY TEST?

199
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,900
>> NO.

200
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,567
>> NO, WE NEVER GOT

201
00:04:37,567 --> 00:04:38,433
A PATERNITY TEST; SHE DIDN'T

202
00:04:38,433 --> 00:04:39,067
WANT TO GET ONE.

203
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:40,333
AND I'M FILING FOR ONE RIGHT NOW

204
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:41,233
BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE

205
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:41,900
SURE HE'S MINE.

206
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,733
'CAUSE SHE TOLD ME THAT HE

207
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:43,633
WASN'T MINE AT ONE POINT.

208
00:04:43,633 --> 00:04:44,900
>> THAT'S A LIE.

209
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,667
>> YOU DIDN'T SAY THAT?

210
00:04:45,667 --> 00:04:46,300
>> THAT IS A LIE.

211
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,200
>> SHE TOLD ME HE WASN'T MINE,

212
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:47,833
FIRST OF ALL.

213
00:04:47,833 --> 00:04:48,600
>> YOU SURE YOU DIDN'T

214
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:49,300
IN A RAGE OR SOMETHING?

215
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,100
>> I'M SURE I DIDN'T.

216
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:50,700
I'M POSITIVE.

217
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:51,767
>> I'M 100--I DON'T HAVE

218
00:04:51,767 --> 00:04:52,567
NO REASON TO LIE.

219
00:04:52,567 --> 00:04:53,233
>> IS THERE ANY CHANCE

220
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:53,900
IT'S NOT YOUR--

221
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,567
>> NO.

222
00:04:54,567 --> 00:04:55,300
>> OKAY.

223
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,067
>> ALL RIGHT, YOU LYING

224
00:04:56,067 --> 00:04:56,667
FOR EVERYTHING, LIKE,

225
00:04:56,667 --> 00:04:57,300
ALL THIS--

226
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:57,967
>> THIS IS A CHANCE

227
00:04:57,967 --> 00:04:58,667
TO TALK TO HIM.

228
00:04:58,667 --> 00:04:59,367
>> NO, I DON'T WANT

229
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:00,067
TO TALK TO HIM.

230
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:00,767
>> OUTSIDE IN THE WORLD

231
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:01,667
IT'S GONNA GET OUT OF CONTROL.

232
00:05:01,667 --> 00:05:02,700
>> NO, NO, NEED TO TALK TO HIM.

233
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,700
>> I'VE ALWAYS BEEN THERE

234
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:05,067
FOR MY SON; I ALWAYS HAVE BREAD.

235
00:05:05,067 --> 00:05:06,733
I'M GOOD. I'M SET.

236
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:07,400
>> WHERE IS IT?

237
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,067
>> RIGHT HERE.

238
00:05:08,067 --> 00:05:10,600
>> I'VE GOT NONE OF IT. DON'T.

239
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,267
DON'T EVEN.

240
00:05:12,267 --> 00:05:14,600
>> I'D PICK THAT

241
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,400
UP IF I WERE YOU.

242
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,333
IF I WERE YOU.

243
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,067
THAT'S BABY MONEY.

244
00:05:20,067 --> 00:05:20,667
>> [bleep] YOU, BITCH.

245
00:05:20,667 --> 00:05:22,367
>> THAT'S BABY MONEY.

246
00:05:22,367 --> 00:05:23,567
THAT'S BABY MONEY TO ME.

247
00:05:23,567 --> 00:05:24,967
I SAID I BEEN ON MY JOB.

248
00:05:24,967 --> 00:05:25,867
I BEEN GRINDING.

249
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,533
I'M NOT NO JOKE.

250
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:28,200
I CARE ABOUT MY SON.

251
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:28,933
>> I'M JUST COUNTING

252
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:29,633
WHAT'S HERE,

253
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:30,367
>> OH, THAT'S A GOOD--

254
00:05:30,367 --> 00:05:31,067
>> HANG ON,

255
00:05:31,067 --> 00:05:32,800
AND THIS WOULD COVER FORMULA

256
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,133
FOR ABOUT THREE DAYS.

257
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:34,800
>> OH, NO.

258
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,833
THAT'S JUST PLAY MONEY.

259
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:36,700
SHE CAN HAVE THIS BECAUSE SHE

260
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,800
COMPLAINING, BUT LIKE I SAID,

261
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,633
I GOT A CREDIT UNION

262
00:05:38,633 --> 00:05:40,067
WITH $3,200 DOLLARS FOR MY SON.

263
00:05:40,067 --> 00:05:40,767
YOU FEEL ME, THESE PHONES

264
00:05:40,767 --> 00:05:41,633
RIGHT HERE,

265
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,733
THESE $500.

266
00:05:43,733 --> 00:05:44,833
YOU TELLING ME,

267
00:05:44,833 --> 00:05:46,067
THAT'S JUST BABY MONEY.

268
00:05:46,067 --> 00:05:46,833
>> THAT SHOULD HAVE GONE

269
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:47,500
TO THE BABY.

270
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,200
>> WHAT YOU MEAN?

271
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,467
IT WENT TO

272
00:05:49,467 --> 00:05:51,067
MY LAWYER SO I COULD GET MY SON.

273
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:51,733
>> ALL THAT MONEY

274
00:05:51,733 --> 00:05:52,567
THAT YOU SPENT ON SHOES

275
00:05:52,567 --> 00:05:53,700
AND A WATCH

276
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,667
SHOULD HAVE GONE TO THE BABY.

277
00:05:54,667 --> 00:05:55,600
>> ONCE I GET THIS CUSTODY,

278
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,167
MY SON GONNA COME HOME SET.

279
00:05:57,167 --> 00:05:57,833
TRUST ME.

280
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:58,533
>> ALL RIGHT.

281
00:05:58,533 --> 00:05:59,533
LET'S TAKE A QUICK BREAK,

282
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:01,067
AND LET'S SEE IF WE CAN RESET

283
00:06:01,067 --> 00:06:01,800
THINGS HERE A LITTLE BIT

284
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,467
AND GET ARIANNA

285
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:04,767
BACK ON FOR US, OKAY?

286
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:13,067
>> SO, MAURICE,

287
00:06:13,067 --> 00:06:13,833
HELP ME UNDERSTAND

288
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:15,567
WHAT YOU INTENDED WITH THIS.

289
00:06:15,567 --> 00:06:16,300
I MEAN,

290
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,967
ARIANNA FLEW OUT OF HERE.

291
00:06:17,967 --> 00:06:19,933
WHAT DID YOU MEAN WITH THIS?

292
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:22,900
>> SHE ASKED ME WHERE IS IT AT.

293
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,900
OKAY, OBVIOUSLY I GOT IT,

294
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,267
SO I JUST SHOWED HER AND JUST

295
00:06:26,267 --> 00:06:27,133
CHANGED THE WAY I SHOWED HER.

296
00:06:27,133 --> 00:06:28,133
>> SO YOU JUST MADE A GESTURE.

297
00:06:28,133 --> 00:06:28,867
>> YEAH, A GESTURE.

298
00:06:28,867 --> 00:06:30,233
TO SHOW I GOT IT.

299
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:33,867
I'M SET.

300
00:06:33,867 --> 00:06:35,267
>> I'M GONNA SEND THE PRODUCTION

301
00:06:35,267 --> 00:06:36,300
STAFF BACK TO SEE

302
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:37,900
IF THEY CAN GET ARIANNA TO AGREE

303
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,967
TO COME BACK ONSTAGE HERE,

304
00:06:38,967 --> 00:06:40,200
AND IF THEY CAN BRING HER BACK

305
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,633
OUT, WE'D REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

306
00:06:41,633 --> 00:06:42,567
>> SHE CAN PICK THE MONEY UP,

307
00:06:42,567 --> 00:06:43,233
TOO, WHEN SHE COME

308
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:43,900
BACK OUT HERE.

309
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:44,733
>> LISTEN, SHE'S NOT GOING

310
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:45,400
TO PICK THE MONEY UP.

311
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,733
ARIANNA, THANK YOU FOR AGREEING

312
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:48,167
TO COME BACK OUT.

313
00:06:48,167 --> 00:06:49,267
>> MOVE.

314
00:06:49,267 --> 00:06:52,667
>> I'M SORRY I DIDN'T MOVE NOW.

315
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:53,567
>> OH, SHE DON'T WANT MY MONEY

316
00:06:53,567 --> 00:06:54,133
NOW, WHAT?

317
00:06:54,133 --> 00:06:55,367
>> MAURICE HOLD ON A SECOND.

318
00:06:55,367 --> 00:06:56,067
SO WHAT DID THAT FEEL

319
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:56,733
LIKE FOR YOU?

320
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:57,467
>> HE'S DISRESPECTFUL.

321
00:06:57,467 --> 00:06:58,367
HE HAS NO HOME TRAINING.

322
00:06:58,367 --> 00:06:59,333
>> SO THAT WAS DISRESPECTFUL.

323
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:00,067
>> YEAH.

324
00:07:00,067 --> 00:07:00,733
>> OKAY.

325
00:07:00,733 --> 00:07:01,633
>> WHEN YOU GUYS WERE A COUPLE,

326
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:02,933
YOU SORT OF GOT ALONG, RIGHT?

327
00:07:02,933 --> 00:07:03,600
>> MM-HMM.

328
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:04,367
>> WHAT WENT WRONG?

329
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:05,400
WHERE DID THIS GO SO FAR

330
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,400
OFF TRACK?

331
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,067
>> A CHILD

332
00:07:07,067 --> 00:07:07,767
CAME INTO THE PICTURE,

333
00:07:07,767 --> 00:07:08,700
AND HE'S A LITTLE BOY,

334
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,467
AND HE CAN'T HANDLE IT.

335
00:07:09,467 --> 00:07:10,400
>> SO YOU NEEDED HIM TO STEP UP,

336
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,800
AND HE WASN'T WILLING TO

337
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,800
OR ABLE TO.

338
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,267
>> AGAIN, WE STARTED BY TALKING

339
00:07:18,267 --> 00:07:19,067
ABOUT HOW HURTFUL

340
00:07:19,067 --> 00:07:19,767
THIS IS TO YOU.

341
00:07:19,767 --> 00:07:20,467
>> MM-HMM.

342
00:07:20,467 --> 00:07:21,967
>> THIS MUST HURT EVEN MORE.

343
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:23,933
>> NO, HE'S DISRESPECTFUL.

344
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:24,733
THAT'S ALL IT IS.

345
00:07:24,733 --> 00:07:26,900
>> BUT THAT HURTS. THAT HURTS.

346
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,733
>> BECAUSE HE'S DISRESPECTFUL.

347
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:29,567
I FEEL SORRY FOR HIM

348
00:07:29,567 --> 00:07:30,900
BECAUSE HE HAS NO HOME TRAINING.

349
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:31,667
HE MADE HIMSELF LOOK

350
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:33,267
STUPID, NOT ME.

351
00:07:33,267 --> 00:07:33,967
I DON'T LOOK STUPID.

352
00:07:33,967 --> 00:07:34,733
>> I DON'T LOOK STUPID.

353
00:07:34,733 --> 00:07:36,133
>> YEAH, BUT YOUR CHILD

354
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:38,767
ENDS UP WITH NO DAD.

355
00:07:38,767 --> 00:07:39,567
DON'T YOU WANT TO TRY TO--

356
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:41,467
>> HE DOESN'T NEED A--SOMEONE

357
00:07:41,467 --> 00:07:42,167
LIKE THAT IN HIS LIFE.

358
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:42,867
>> WHY WOULD I HAND

359
00:07:42,867 --> 00:07:43,533
OVER NO BREAD

360
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:44,433
IF I'M FILING WITH A LAWYER

361
00:07:44,433 --> 00:07:45,133
TO GET CUSTODY?

362
00:07:45,133 --> 00:07:46,133
HOW IS HE GONNA HAVE A DAD?

363
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,767
>> WEREN'T YOU TALKING TO ME?

364
00:07:47,767 --> 00:07:48,500
>> I'M TRYING TO TALK

365
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,200
TO BOTH OF YOU.

366
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:50,067
WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP

367
00:07:50,067 --> 00:07:51,500
THIS A LITTLE BIT BALANCED.

368
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,933
RIGHT, HE'S THE DAD.

369
00:07:52,933 --> 00:07:53,833
>> I AM THE DAD.

370
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:54,800
THAT'S WHY I'M DOING

371
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,067
MY DADLY THING,

372
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:57,100
WHICH IS WHY I'M TAKING HER

373
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,333
TO COURT SO I CAN GET MY SON

374
00:07:58,333 --> 00:08:00,467
BECAUSE I DO CARE, SO...

375
00:08:00,467 --> 00:08:01,533
>> AND YOUR CHILD.

376
00:08:01,533 --> 00:08:02,300
YOU WOULD LIKE YOUR CHILD

377
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,333
TO HAVE A DAD, HIS DAD.

378
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,067
>> AND HE WILL.

379
00:08:06,067 --> 00:08:06,933
>> IF HE ACTS LIKE THIS,

380
00:08:06,933 --> 00:08:08,067
DEFINITELY NOT.

381
00:08:08,067 --> 00:08:08,800
NO, NO.

382
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,633
>> AND THIS

383
00:08:09,633 --> 00:08:12,167
BEING CHILDISH, DISRESPECTFUL.

384
00:08:12,167 --> 00:08:13,067
>> YES, IF A JUDGE

385
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:14,100
SEES THIS, DO YOU THINK

386
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,967
HE'S GONNA LET HIM HAVE MY SON?

387
00:08:15,967 --> 00:08:17,667
THAT'S A JOKE. IT'S A JOKE.

388
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:18,500
>> WHY?

389
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,733
HE HAS MONEY; WHY WOULDN'T HE

390
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:20,433
LET HIM HAVE HIS SON?

391
00:08:20,433 --> 00:08:21,267
>> WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE

392
00:08:21,267 --> 00:08:22,667
TO SEE FROM MAURICE?

393
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:24,300
JUST FINANCIAL SUPPORT

394
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,467
AND THAT'S IT?

395
00:08:25,467 --> 00:08:27,100
>> NO, HE HAS TO CHANGE

396
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,233
AS A PERSON.

397
00:08:28,233 --> 00:08:29,567
HE'S CRAZY.

398
00:08:29,567 --> 00:08:32,767
HE'S CHILDISH.

399
00:08:32,767 --> 00:08:34,067
HE'S IRRESPONSIBLE.

400
00:08:34,067 --> 00:08:35,067
HE'S SELFISH.

401
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:36,567
>> EVERYBODY SEEN THE EPISODE

402
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:39,733
WHERE I WAS--

403
00:08:39,733 --> 00:08:44,067
>> AND HE'S GHETTO AND RATCHET

404
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:45,667
AND I'M NOT.

405
00:08:45,667 --> 00:08:47,767
>> WOW.

406
00:08:47,767 --> 00:08:48,533
>> SO ARIANNA,

407
00:08:48,533 --> 00:08:49,467
NOW'S AIDEN DOING?

408
00:08:49,467 --> 00:08:50,267
>> HE'S DOING GREAT.

409
00:08:50,267 --> 00:08:53,833
HE'S MAKING A LOT OF--

410
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:54,900
LIKE HIS MOTOR SKILLS

411
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:55,600
ARE GETTING

412
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,467
MORE AND MORE ADVANCED

413
00:08:56,467 --> 00:08:57,433
EVERY DAY.

414
00:08:57,433 --> 00:08:58,133
>> HOW OLD IS HE NOW?

415
00:08:58,133 --> 00:08:59,100
>> SIX MONTHS.

416
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,200
>> SO HE'S STARTING TO CRAWL?

417
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,100
>> NO HE CAN'T CRAWL.

418
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,600
HE CAN FLIP FROM HIS BACK

419
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,267
TO HIS BELLY

420
00:09:04,267 --> 00:09:05,267
AND HE CAN DO--YOU KNOW,

421
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:06,600
LIKE, SIT UP LIKE THIS,

422
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,867
BUT HE CAN'T CRAWL.

423
00:09:07,867 --> 00:09:09,600
>> NICE, AND HE'S HAPPY?

424
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,933
>> YES. HE'S VERY HAPPY.

425
00:09:11,933 --> 00:09:13,900
>> THAT MAKES YOU HAPPY,

426
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,667
THAT'S GOOD.

427
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:17,633
AND HE DOES LOVE HIS SON.

428
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:19,267
WHATEVER ELSE YOU SAY ABOUT

429
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:20,967
MAURICE, WE GOT THAT AT LEAST.

430
00:09:20,967 --> 00:09:23,533
>> OH, I KNOW THAT HE DOES.

431
00:09:23,533 --> 00:09:25,067
>> SMALL STEPS. BABY STEPS.

432
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:26,067
KEEP THE GOOD THINGS IN MIND.

433
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:27,067
OKAY?

434
00:09:27,067 --> 00:09:28,333
WE'VE GOT A LOT OF OTHER STORIES

435
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,067
TO GET TO TODAY.

436
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:29,733
AND COMING UP,

437
00:09:29,733 --> 00:09:30,433
WE WILL TALK TO SAVANNAH

438
00:09:30,433 --> 00:09:31,667
ABOUT WHAT IT'S LIKE TO CALL

439
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:32,933
THE COPS ON HER OWN MOM.

440
00:09:32,933 --> 00:09:34,067
STAY TUNED FOR MORE 16 

441
00:09:34,067 --> 00:09:36,067
 AND PREGNANT: LIFE AFTER LABOR. 

442
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,067
>> WELCOME BACK.

443
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:44,733
I'M JOINED NOW

444
00:09:44,733 --> 00:09:46,167
BY SAVANNAH AND STONE,

445
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:48,233
AND AN UNFORTUNATE RECURRING

446
00:09:48,233 --> 00:09:49,233
THEME OF THIS SEASON

447
00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:50,600
WAS THE ISSUE OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE

448
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:51,467
AND ADDICTION.

449
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:53,400
THREE EPISODES FEATURED TEENS

450
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,733
WHOSE MOTHERS THEMSELVES

451
00:09:54,733 --> 00:09:56,167
STRUGGLED WITH ADDICTION WHICH,

452
00:09:56,167 --> 00:09:57,800
OF COURSE, INCLUDED SAVANNAH.

453
00:09:57,800 --> 00:09:58,633
HERE'S A LOOK BACK

454
00:09:58,633 --> 00:10:00,033
AT HOW SHE DEALT WITH

455
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:04,067
HER MOTHER'S ALCOHOLISM.

456
00:10:04,067 --> 00:10:05,100
>> I DON'T HAVE TO BE WITH YOU

457
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:06,200
TO PARENT, I REALLY DON'T.

458
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,100
>> I NEVER SAID YOU DID.

459
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,533
>> WHEN I GOT PREGNANT,

460
00:10:09,533 --> 00:10:10,300
YOU DID TELL ME

461
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,567
WE WERE GONNA DO THIS TOGETHER,

462
00:10:11,567 --> 00:10:12,333
AND I FEEL

463
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:13,467
LIKE I'M DOING THIS WITHOUT YOU

464
00:10:13,467 --> 00:10:14,700
BECAUSE OF YOUR DRINKING.

465
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,767
>> YOU'RE WRONG.

466
00:10:15,767 --> 00:10:17,000
>> DO YOU GUYS FEEL COMFORTABLE

467
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,467
WITH THE BABY BEING WITH ME?

468
00:10:18,467 --> 00:10:20,300
>> YOU GOT A MAJOR PROBLEM.

469
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:23,400
>> OLD HABITS ARE HARD TO BREAK.

470
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,733
STOP SLAMMING DOORS.

471
00:10:25,733 --> 00:10:26,800
I'LL GET THE COPS OVER HERE.

472
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,567
>> DO IT.

473
00:10:28,567 --> 00:10:29,633
>> EVERYTHING'LL WORK OUT

474
00:10:29,633 --> 00:10:31,100
THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO.

475
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,933
I JUST HOPE IT COMES

476
00:10:31,933 --> 00:10:34,367
SOONER RATHER THAN LATER.

477
00:10:36,467 --> 00:10:37,633
>> YOU'RE GETTING A LITTLE TEARY

478
00:10:37,633 --> 00:10:38,533
JUST LOOKING AT THE EPISODE.

479
00:10:38,533 --> 00:10:42,133
WHAT ARE YOU FEELING?

480
00:10:42,133 --> 00:10:43,167
>> EMBARRASSMENT.

481
00:10:43,167 --> 00:10:44,267
>> EMBARRASSED?

482
00:10:44,267 --> 00:10:47,300
WHY?

483
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:48,067
>> BECAUSE IT WAS EASY

484
00:10:48,067 --> 00:10:50,333
TO HIDE WHEN IT WASN'T PUBLIC.

485
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,300
>> WELL, BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE

486
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,967
DEAL WITH THIS, A LOT OF PEOPLE.

487
00:10:52,967 --> 00:10:53,700
IT'S A COMMON THING

488
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,400
YOUR MOM'S GOT.

489
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,267
IT'S DIFFERENT WHEN IT'S

490
00:10:57,267 --> 00:10:57,967
YOUR MOM THOUGH, RIGHT?

491
00:10:57,967 --> 00:11:00,433
>> YEAH.

492
00:11:00,433 --> 00:11:01,167
>> HOW HARD WAS IT FOR YOU

493
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:03,567
TO CONFRONT HER THAT WAY?

494
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:05,067
>> EXTREMELY HARD.

495
00:11:05,067 --> 00:11:06,533
>> YEAH.

496
00:11:06,533 --> 00:11:07,467
>> I MEAN FOR SO LONG

497
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:08,433
IT WAS ME AND MY MOM

498
00:11:08,433 --> 00:11:10,167
AND ALL WE HAD WAS EACH OTHER,

499
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:11,067
AND I FEEL

500
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:13,933
LIKE CONFRONTING HER LIKE THAT

501
00:11:13,933 --> 00:11:15,333
ONLY HURT HER FEELINGS.

502
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:16,233
>> AND SHE'S BEEN TO TREATMENT

503
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:17,100
MULTIPLE TIMES, RIGHT?

504
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:17,767
>> YEAH.

505
00:11:17,767 --> 00:11:18,500
>> SO SHE KNOWS

506
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,667
WHAT SHE NEEDS TO DO.

507
00:11:19,667 --> 00:11:21,500
SHE'S NOT DOING IT.

508
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,333
SO IT'S ON HER.

509
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,667
SHE'S RIGHT ON THAT ONE.

510
00:11:25,667 --> 00:11:26,767
BUT IT'S HEARTBREAKING TO SEE

511
00:11:26,767 --> 00:11:28,300
SOMEBODY YOU LOVE DO THAT.

512
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:31,200
ISN'T IT?

513
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:35,600
>> YEAH.

514
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,167
>> IT'S HARD.

515
00:11:47,867 --> 00:11:51,067
WELL, GIVE ME YOUR HAND.

516
00:11:51,067 --> 00:11:52,233
YOU HAVE STONE NOW IN YOUR LIFE.

517
00:11:52,233 --> 00:11:54,267
HAS HE BEEN HELPFUL?

518
00:11:54,267 --> 00:11:55,067
>> FOR THE MOST PART.

519
00:11:55,067 --> 00:11:56,600
>> FOR THE MOST PART.

520
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,833
WHAT'S YOUR RELATIONSHIP STATUS

521
00:11:57,833 --> 00:12:00,400
NOW, YOU TWO?

522
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,133
NO RELATIONSHIP.

523
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:01,800
>> NO.

524
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,233
>> AS WE LEFT THE SEASON,

525
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:04,200
IT SEEMED LIKE YOU

526
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,133
TWO WERE GETTING TOGETHER.

527
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:08,433
>> TRYING TO.

528
00:12:08,433 --> 00:12:11,567
>> WHAT HAPPENED?

529
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:12,800
>> JUST CAN'T DO IT.

530
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,067
>> WHY?

531
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,367
>> A LOT OF ARGUING--I

532
00:12:16,367 --> 00:12:18,500
DON'T KNOW WHAT STARTS IT,

533
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:23,367
BUT IT'S A LOT.

534
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:24,133
>> MY UNDERSTANDING IS,

535
00:12:24,133 --> 00:12:25,500
WHEN YOU WATCHED THE EPISODE,

536
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,900
YOU HAD A LOT OF EMOTION.

537
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,800
>> YEAH.

538
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,967
THERE WAS A LOT OF STUFF

539
00:12:31,967 --> 00:12:34,067
THAT I DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT

540
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:35,067
UNTIL I WATCHED IT AND THEN

541
00:12:35,067 --> 00:12:35,967
I FIGURED IT OUT.

542
00:12:35,967 --> 00:12:38,600
>> LIKE WHAT?

543
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:39,933
>> HER TALKING TO OTHER GUYS

544
00:12:39,933 --> 00:12:40,767
WHEN WE WERE TRYING

545
00:12:40,767 --> 00:12:44,067
TO GET BACK TOGETHER,

546
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:47,167
AND IT WAS A LOT, YOU KNOW.

547
00:12:47,167 --> 00:12:47,933
I THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA

548
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,400
MAKE IT WORK AND HAVE A FAMILY,

549
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,767
AND THAT WAS APPARENTLY NOT

550
00:12:53,767 --> 00:12:55,400
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

551
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,733
>> IS THAT WHY--

552
00:12:56,733 --> 00:12:59,233
TELL ME WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT.

553
00:12:59,233 --> 00:13:05,367
>> WHEN WE BROKE UP,

554
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:09,267
I--AND LATER ON,

555
00:13:09,267 --> 00:13:11,400
IN THE BEGINNING OF MY PREGNANCY

556
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,333
WE BROKE UP.

557
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,233
AND THEN LATER ON WE

558
00:13:13,233 --> 00:13:17,133
TRIED TO FIX THINGS.

559
00:13:17,133 --> 00:13:17,900
WHILE DOING SO

560
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:19,200
I DID KEEP MY OPTIONS OPEN

561
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,733
AND WAS ENTERTAINING THE IDEA

562
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:23,467
OF A DIFFERENT PERSON.

563
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:24,467
>> WHILE YOU WERE BROKEN UP

564
00:13:24,467 --> 00:13:25,367
DURING YOUR PREGNANCY?

565
00:13:25,367 --> 00:13:26,333
>> YES.

566
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:27,067
>> AND THAT'S

567
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:27,967
WHAT YOU SAW IN THE EPISODE

568
00:13:27,967 --> 00:13:29,333
THAT GOT YOU UPSET.

569
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,067
>> YEAH.

570
00:13:30,067 --> 00:13:30,900
>> YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THAT?

571
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,867
>> NO, AND JUST UNDER A MONTH

572
00:13:32,867 --> 00:13:35,733
BEFORE SHE GIVES BIRTH.

573
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:36,433
>> DO YOU WANT

574
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:37,900
TO GET BACK TOGETHER?

575
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,633
OH, WELL THAT'S PRETTY CLEAR.

576
00:13:39,633 --> 00:13:41,100
WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THAT?

577
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:41,833
>> I DON'T WANT TO BE

578
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,300
IN A RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM.

579
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,567
>> WHY?

580
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:45,300
>> BECAUSE HE MADE ME

581
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,067
MISERABLE MY WHOLE PREGNANCY

582
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:48,300
AND I CAN'T LET GO OF IT.

583
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,500
>> YOU CAN'T LET GO OF IT.

584
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,267
HOW DID HE MAKE YOU MISERABLE?

585
00:13:51,267 --> 00:13:52,100
>> THE DAY

586
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:54,067
AFTER I TOOK THE PREGNANCY TEST

587
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:55,967
AND FOUND OUT I WAS PREGNANT

588
00:13:55,967 --> 00:13:57,067
IS WHEN IT ALL CHANGED.

589
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:59,367
I WAS CALLED WORTHLESS

590
00:13:59,367 --> 00:14:00,800
FOR TURNING OFF THE TV

591
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,600
AND WANTING YOUR ATTENTION.

592
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:03,300
>> YOU NEVER WANTED

593
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:03,967
MY ATTENTION.

594
00:14:03,967 --> 00:14:05,133
>> I WANTED YOUR ATTENTION

595
00:14:05,133 --> 00:14:06,500
SO BAD.

596
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,667
SO BAD, STONE,

597
00:14:07,667 --> 00:14:09,667
I WANTED YOUR ATTENTION.

598
00:14:09,667 --> 00:14:10,733
I WANTED TO BE TREATED

599
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:11,900
LIKE THE MOTHER OF YOUR CHILD

600
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:13,200
AND NOT PROPERTY.

601
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,167
I WANTED TO BE TREATED

602
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:14,867
WITH RESPECT

603
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:15,633
AND ACTUALLY FELT

604
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:16,767
LIKE YOU LOVED ME.

605
00:14:16,767 --> 00:14:19,067
EVERY DAY YOU PUT ME DOWN.

606
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,167
>> EVERY DAY I FELT LIKE YOU

607
00:14:20,167 --> 00:14:21,733
WERE EMBARRASSED TO BE WITH ME,

608
00:14:21,733 --> 00:14:22,567
EVEN BEFORE ALL THIS.

609
00:14:22,567 --> 00:14:23,933
>> I WAS SO PROUD TO HAVE YOUR--

610
00:14:23,933 --> 00:14:27,667
I WAS SO PROUD TO BE WITH YOU

611
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:28,400
AND TO SAY

612
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,067
I WAS CARRYING YOUR BABY.

613
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:31,067
>> I FEEL THAT THERE WAS NEVER

614
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:31,800
ANY COMMITMENT

615
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,167
IN THE RELATIONSHIP.

616
00:14:33,167 --> 00:14:34,933
IT WAS ALWAYS A MORE

617
00:14:34,933 --> 00:14:36,267
OF AN OPEN RELATIONSHIP,

618
00:14:36,267 --> 00:14:38,167
ONE-SIDED OPEN RELATIONSHIP,

619
00:14:38,167 --> 00:14:38,833
I MEAN.

620
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:39,600
>> YOU MEAN SHE WAS ALLOWED

621
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,267
TO SEE OTHER GUYS

622
00:14:40,267 --> 00:14:41,067
AND YOU WEREN'T ALLOWED

623
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:41,967
TO SEE OTHER GIRLS?

624
00:14:41,967 --> 00:14:42,633
IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN?

625
00:14:42,633 --> 00:14:44,200
I'M JUST ASKING.

626
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:44,967
>> IT FELT LIKE IT.

627
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:45,733
>> IT FELT LIKE IT.

628
00:14:45,733 --> 00:14:46,933
ARE YOU SEEING SOMEBODY ELSE?

629
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:47,833
HAVE YOU MOVED ON?

630
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,133
>> YEAH.

631
00:14:49,133 --> 00:14:50,067
>> SO SHE'S KIND OF MOVED ON.

632
00:14:50,067 --> 00:14:50,767
HAVE YOU?

633
00:14:50,767 --> 00:14:51,967
HAVE YOU MOVED ON?

634
00:14:51,967 --> 00:14:54,467
PRETTY MUCH.

635
00:14:54,467 --> 00:14:56,333
WITH ALL THIS GOING ON,

636
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:58,300
HOW DO YOU GUYS PARENT?

637
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,567
DO YOU CO-PARENT?

638
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:01,267
>> TRYING TO.

639
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:02,067
>> ARE YOU SEEING THE BABY

640
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,733
ENOUGH?

641
00:15:03,733 --> 00:15:04,467
ARE YOU SEEING THE BABY

642
00:15:04,467 --> 00:15:05,167
ENOUGH FOR YOU?

643
00:15:05,167 --> 00:15:06,067
IS HE PARTICIPATING?

644
00:15:06,067 --> 00:15:07,700
>> YEAH. HE'S AN AWESOME DAD.

645
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,233
>> HAS SHE EVER TOLD YOU THAT?

646
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:10,733
>> YEAH.

647
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:11,833
AND I'VE NEVER QUESTIONED

648
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:14,400
HER MOTHERING SKILLS EITHER.

649
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,400
>> SO FROM THE STANDPOINT

650
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:17,067
OF YOUR CHILD,

651
00:15:17,067 --> 00:15:19,167
THINGS LOOK PEACEFUL.

652
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:20,600
SAVANNAH, WHAT IS YOUR HOPE

653
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:22,667
FROM NOW ON FROM BOTH OF YOU?

654
00:15:22,667 --> 00:15:23,967
FROM HIS PERSPECTIVE,

655
00:15:23,967 --> 00:15:25,200
WHAT'S YOUR WISH?

656
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,533
>> THAT STONE AND I WILL LEARN

657
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:27,233
TO HAVE A HEALTHY

658
00:15:27,233 --> 00:15:28,600
CO-PARENTING RELATIONSHIP,

659
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,067
AND SHOW ROW THAT EVEN THOUGH

660
00:15:32,067 --> 00:15:33,267
HIS PARENTS AREN'T TOGETHER,

661
00:15:33,267 --> 00:15:34,733
WE CAN STILL GET ALONG.

662
00:15:34,733 --> 00:15:36,233
>> OKAY, I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT

663
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:37,167
YOU'RE GONNA BE MUCH DIFFERENT.

664
00:15:37,167 --> 00:15:37,933
>> NO.

665
00:15:37,933 --> 00:15:38,600
>> SAME.

666
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,267
>> YEAH.

667
00:15:39,267 --> 00:15:39,933
>> YOU GUYS ANYWHERE

668
00:15:39,933 --> 00:15:41,167
NEAR THAT GOAL?

669
00:15:41,167 --> 00:15:43,067
>> NO. FAR FROM IT.

670
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,067
>> LET'S GO BACK

671
00:15:44,067 --> 00:15:47,200
TO HOW WE GOT TO THIS SITUATION,

672
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,633
WHICH WAS LACK OF INFORMATION

673
00:15:48,633 --> 00:15:50,900
ABOUT CONTRACEPTION, RIGHT?

674
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,367
YOU DID NOT UNDERSTAND YOU COULD

675
00:15:52,367 --> 00:15:55,300
GET PREGNANT, IS THAT ACCURATE?

676
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,067
>> WELL, I DIDN'T THINK

677
00:15:56,067 --> 00:15:57,433
IT WOULD HAPPEN TO ME.

678
00:15:57,433 --> 00:15:58,200
>> WHY?

679
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:58,967
>> I NEVER THOUGHT

680
00:15:58,967 --> 00:15:59,733
IT WOULD HAPPEN BECAUSE,

681
00:15:59,733 --> 00:16:01,433
WELL, I WAS IN A RELATIONSHIP

682
00:16:01,433 --> 00:16:02,167
FOR A YEAR

683
00:16:02,167 --> 00:16:03,167
AND A HALF PRIOR TO STONE,

684
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:04,267
AND I NEVER USED PROTECTION,

685
00:16:04,267 --> 00:16:05,733
AND I NEVER GOT PREGNANT.

686
00:16:05,733 --> 00:16:07,067
>> SO WISHFUL THINKING.

687
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:07,733
>> YEAH.

688
00:16:07,733 --> 00:16:08,433
>> ALL THE WAY ALONG.

689
00:16:08,433 --> 00:16:09,100
>> YEAH.

690
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,067
>> STONE, HOW ABOUT YOU?

691
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:11,600
WHAT DO YOU DO?

692
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,267
>> CONDOMS.

693
00:16:12,267 --> 00:16:13,200
>> AND WHAT ABOUT YOU?

694
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,100
>> I HAVE THE I.U.D.

695
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,333
>> I.U.D. GOOD. FANTASTIC.

696
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,800
SO GOOD.

697
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,933
AND IF YOU WERE TALKING

698
00:16:17,933 --> 00:16:19,133
TO ANOTHER 16-YEAR-OLD

699
00:16:19,133 --> 00:16:19,867
WHO WAS THINKING THE WAY

700
00:16:19,867 --> 00:16:20,600
YOU USED TO THINK,

701
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,067
WHAT WOULD YOU TELL THEM?

702
00:16:22,067 --> 00:16:23,767
>> BIRTH CONTROL.

703
00:16:23,767 --> 00:16:24,700
>> "YOU CAN GET PREGNANT;

704
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,500
JUST LISTEN TO ME."

705
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,267
WELL, GUYS,

706
00:16:27,267 --> 00:16:28,200
THANK YOU FOR SHARING THE STORY,

707
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,600
BUT PLEASE FIND A COMMON GROUND

708
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,167
ON BEHALF OF ROWAN.

709
00:16:31,167 --> 00:16:31,900
ALL RIGHT,

710
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,900
WE NEED TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK.

711
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,433
SO WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

712
00:16:41,867 --> 00:16:43,100
>> PREGNANCY AND PARENTHOOD

713
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,467
PUT A HUGE FINANCIAL STRAIN

714
00:16:45,467 --> 00:16:47,300
ON A COUPLE, ESPECIALLY IF

715
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,200
THE PARENTS ARE TEENAGERS.

716
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,233
THE FACT IS, NEARLY HALF

717
00:16:50,233 --> 00:16:51,100
OF ALL TEEN MOMS

718
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,167
LIVE BELOW THE POVERTY LINE.

719
00:16:53,167 --> 00:16:54,367
JORDAN AND HER BOYFRIEND

720
00:16:54,367 --> 00:16:55,267
DEREK WERE HOMELESS

721
00:16:55,267 --> 00:16:56,600
THROUGH MUCH OF HER PREGNANCY,

722
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,733
MAKING NINE MONTHS

723
00:16:57,733 --> 00:16:58,900
THAT ARE ALREADY REALLY

724
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:00,367
DIFFICULT, THAT MUCH HARDER.

725
00:17:00,367 --> 00:17:03,567
TAKE A LOOK.

726
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:05,467
>> WE ARE BASICALLY HOMELESS.

727
00:17:05,467 --> 00:17:07,300
I HATE LIVING OUT OF THIS CAR.

728
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,467
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE NO MEANS

729
00:17:09,467 --> 00:17:11,167
OF SUPPORTING A BABY.

730
00:17:11,167 --> 00:17:12,767
WOULD WE BE ABLE TO STAY HERE?

731
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:14,233
>> THERE'S NO ROOM.

732
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:15,133
>> I THINK YOU SHOULD ACTUALLY,

733
00:17:15,133 --> 00:17:17,100
LIKE, GO AND GET A JOB.

734
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,467
>> SHE NEEDS HELP.

735
00:17:18,467 --> 00:17:19,200
>> WE'RE LIVING

736
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,100
IN SOMEBODY'S LIVING ROOM.

737
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,433
THAT'S TOTALLY [bleep] UP.

738
00:17:21,433 --> 00:17:22,733
THERE ISN'T NOWHERE TO GO.

739
00:17:22,733 --> 00:17:23,900
FIGURE THAT [bleep] OUT.

740
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,900
>> THE BABY DOESN'T HAVE

741
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,133
ANYTHING.

742
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:27,400
I HAVE NO IDEA

743
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:29,333
WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS FOR MYSELF

744
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:31,067
AND GENEVIEVE AND DEREK.

745
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:38,767
>> THERE YOU GO.

746
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:41,667
WHAT ARE YOU CRYING ABOUT?

747
00:17:41,667 --> 00:17:45,433
>> THAT WAS A REALLY HARD TIME.

748
00:17:45,433 --> 00:17:46,233
>> NO KIDDING.

749
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:51,200
YOU GUYS WERE HOMELESS.

750
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,500
>> A REALLY HARD TIME.

751
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:53,600
>> IS IT JUST PAINFUL

752
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:55,067
TO LOOK BACK ON IT?

753
00:17:55,067 --> 00:17:58,167
HOW DID YOU DIG OUT?

754
00:17:58,167 --> 00:18:00,133
>> WE HAD A LOT OF HELP.

755
00:18:00,133 --> 00:18:01,067
WE DEFINITELY DIDN'T DO

756
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:02,467
IT BY OURSELVES.

757
00:18:02,467 --> 00:18:07,167
WE GOT HELP FROM FAMILY FRIENDS.

758
00:18:07,167 --> 00:18:08,333
MY GRANDMOM COULD HELP

759
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,300
IN ANY WAY SHE COULD.

760
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,467
>> YOU GUYS WENT DOWN TO TEXAS,

761
00:18:10,467 --> 00:18:11,133
RIGHT?

762
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:11,833
>> YEAH.

763
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:12,567
>> HOW DID THAT WORK OUT?

764
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:15,233
>> WELL, IT WAS FINE.

765
00:18:15,233 --> 00:18:16,567
IT WAS NICE.

766
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:17,267
I LIKED IT A LOT,

767
00:18:17,267 --> 00:18:21,067
BUT HE NEEDS TO GO TO SCHOOL.

768
00:18:21,067 --> 00:18:22,267
HE HAS A SCHOLARSHIP AND I

769
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:23,367
DIDN'T WANT HIM TO LOSE THAT,

770
00:18:23,367 --> 00:18:24,867
SO WE HAVE TO GO BACK

771
00:18:24,867 --> 00:18:25,567
TO MARYLAND.

772
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:26,533
>> GO BACK TO MARYLAND.

773
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:28,467
AND AGAIN THE TEARS ARE ABOUT

774
00:18:28,467 --> 00:18:29,633
HOW DESPERATE YOU FELT?

775
00:18:29,633 --> 00:18:30,400
>> YEAH.

776
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:33,967
IT WAS SO UPSETTING TO KNOW

777
00:18:33,967 --> 00:18:36,333
I COULDN'T SUPPORT MY OWN CHILD.

778
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:43,300
TO KNOW THAT I WAS LIVING

779
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,567
OFF OF SOMEONE ELSE,

780
00:18:44,567 --> 00:18:45,567
IN THEIR HOME,

781
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:48,267
IN A LIVING ROOM WITH A BABY.

782
00:18:48,267 --> 00:18:50,933
AND I HADN'T BOUGHT HER ANYTHING

783
00:18:50,933 --> 00:18:51,633
BECAUSE I COULDN'T.

784
00:18:51,633 --> 00:18:53,400
IT WAS JUST STUFF

785
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,100
THAT OTHER PEOPLE

786
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:56,067
BOUGHT THAT'S EMBARRASSING.

787
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:57,267
YOU BRING A CHILD

788
00:18:57,267 --> 00:18:57,933
INTO THE WORLD,

789
00:18:57,933 --> 00:18:58,633
YOU'RE SUPPOSED

790
00:18:58,633 --> 00:19:00,567
TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THEM,

791
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:02,133
AND I COULDN'T AND THAT MADE

792
00:19:02,133 --> 00:19:04,367
ME FEEL TERRIBLE.

793
00:19:04,367 --> 00:19:05,567
>> AND YOU WERE LAYING A LOT

794
00:19:05,567 --> 00:19:08,067
OF THAT ON DEREK, RIGHT?

795
00:19:08,067 --> 00:19:09,133
AND THEN HE, AT FIRST,

796
00:19:09,133 --> 00:19:10,667
DIDN'T KICK IN.

797
00:19:10,667 --> 00:19:11,333
THAT MUST HAVE MADE

798
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:12,300
YOU FEEL MORE DESPERATE.

799
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,333
>> YEAH. THAT STRESSED ME OUT.

800
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,067
HE WAS DEFINITELY WAY

801
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:17,833
MORE RELAXED THAN I WAS.

802
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:18,600
>> WHAT WAS THAT LIKE GOING

803
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,400
THROUGH FOR YOU?

804
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,167
>> IT WAS SUPER STRESSFUL.

805
00:19:22,167 --> 00:19:24,100
I JUST HANDLE MY STRESS A LOT

806
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:24,800
DIFFERENTLY.

807
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:25,533
>> CAN YOU APPRECIATE

808
00:19:25,533 --> 00:19:26,333
WHAT SHE'S TALKING ABOUT?

809
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:28,067
DID YOU FEEL ANY OF THAT?

810
00:19:28,067 --> 00:19:31,133
>> OH, YEAH. YEAH.

811
00:19:31,133 --> 00:19:32,067
>> AND WHO WAS IT

812
00:19:32,067 --> 00:19:33,567
THAT YOU WERE LIVING WITH?

813
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:34,467
>> HER NAME'S TRACY.

814
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:35,200
>> DO YOU STILL

815
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,067
HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH HER?

816
00:19:36,067 --> 00:19:38,233
>> I TALK TO HER OCCASIONALLY.

817
00:19:38,233 --> 00:19:39,367
SHE WAS ONE

818
00:19:39,367 --> 00:19:41,400
OF HIS DAD'S FRIENDS.

819
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,667
>> SHE'S KEY IN YOU GETTING

820
00:19:42,667 --> 00:19:43,400
THROUGH THIS, RIGHT?

821
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,100
>> YEAH.

822
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,333
>> A HUGE PART.

823
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,800
>> WE SHOULD ALL SAY A BIG

824
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:48,833
THANK YOU TO TRACY, FOR SURE.

825
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:49,600
>> VERY APPRECIATIVE.

826
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,067
>> WHAT WAS YOUR FEAR

827
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:52,067
DURING THAT TIME?

828
00:19:52,067 --> 00:19:53,100
>> THAT WE WOULD STILL BE

829
00:19:53,100 --> 00:19:54,133
IN THE SAME SITUATION

830
00:19:54,133 --> 00:19:55,733
WHEN SHE WAS BORN AND I WOULD BE

831
00:19:55,733 --> 00:19:56,833
TAKING HER FROM PLACE

832
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,600
TO PLACE TO PLACE,

833
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:00,633
OR I WOULD HAVE NOWHERE FOR HER.

834
00:20:00,633 --> 00:20:01,333
>> I'M JUST CURIOUS

835
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,167
HOW YOU'RE GOING TO SUPPORT

836
00:20:02,167 --> 00:20:03,667
YOURSELF NOW IN MARYLAND

837
00:20:03,667 --> 00:20:05,500
AND GO TO SCHOOL.

838
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:08,667
>> WE HAVE A LOT OF HELP STILL.

839
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:09,900
HIS FAMILY IS A BIG HELP. YEAH.

840
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,233
>> SO PEOPLE ARE STEPPING UP

841
00:20:11,233 --> 00:20:11,900
STILL.

842
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,567
>> YES.

843
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:13,300
>> SO WHAT IS IT THAT YOU

844
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,067
WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL FOR?

845
00:20:14,067 --> 00:20:15,333
>> I WANT TO DO KINESIOLOGY

846
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:16,000
EVENTUALLY,

847
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,533
BUT I'M GOING TO GO

848
00:20:17,533 --> 00:20:19,233
TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE FIRST

849
00:20:19,233 --> 00:20:21,300
AND AT LEAST GET MY A.A.

850
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:22,500
>> ULTIMATELY PHYSICAL THERAPY.

851
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,300
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT TO DO?

852
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,433
>> YEAH.

853
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:26,467
>> THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?

854
00:20:26,467 --> 00:20:27,233
>> YEAH.

855
00:20:27,233 --> 00:20:27,967
>> AND WHERE DO YOU STAND

856
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:30,333
WITH YOUR PARENTS NOW?

857
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:34,133
>> I TALK TO THEM, OCCASIONALLY.

858
00:20:34,133 --> 00:20:34,867
>> AND THAT'S IT?

859
00:20:34,867 --> 00:20:35,600
>> YEAH.

860
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:36,300
>> JUST CORDIAL?

861
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,467
>> YEAH, I MEAN, I'LL SEND

862
00:20:37,467 --> 00:20:39,533
MY DAD PICTURES OF THE BABY.

863
00:20:39,533 --> 00:20:40,433
>> IF I GET THE STORY RIGHT,

864
00:20:40,433 --> 00:20:41,733
WASN'T IT DEREK

865
00:20:41,733 --> 00:20:42,733
THEY HAD THE PROBLEM WITH,

866
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:43,500
NOT YOU?

867
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,300
>> THEY ACTUALLY REALLY

868
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:45,300
LIKED HIM.

869
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,633
>> SO WHO WAS KICKED OUT?

870
00:20:46,633 --> 00:20:47,333
>> HE WAS.

871
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,000
>> HE WAS KICKED OUT,

872
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,800
AND YOU JUST WENT WITH HIM.

873
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,033
>> YES.

874
00:20:50,033 --> 00:20:50,833
>> SO YOU WEREN'T ACTUALLY

875
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,867
KICKED OUT, YOU LEFT.

876
00:20:52,867 --> 00:20:55,400
>> TECHNICALLY, YES.

877
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:56,367
>> NOW YOUR RELATIONSHIP

878
00:20:56,367 --> 00:20:58,467
WITH THAT FAMILY IS--

879
00:20:58,467 --> 00:20:59,267
>> IT'S GETTING BETTER.

880
00:20:59,267 --> 00:21:00,333
>> IT'S GETTING BETTER.

881
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,833
DO THEY COME SEE EVIE?

882
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:02,867
>> YES. THEY HAVE SEEN HER.

883
00:21:02,867 --> 00:21:03,733
>> AND YOUR RELATIONSHIP

884
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:05,333
WITH THEM WHEN THEY COME VISIT?

885
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:06,733
>> IT'S CORDIAL.

886
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:07,567
>> CORDIAL.

887
00:21:07,567 --> 00:21:08,367
SO IF YOU WERE TALKING

888
00:21:08,367 --> 00:21:10,667
TO YOURSELF BACK THEN NOW

889
00:21:10,667 --> 00:21:11,500
AS YOU KNOW YOURSELF,

890
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,400
WHAT WOULD YOU TELL YOURSELF?

891
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,400
WHAT YOU TELL JORDAN WHEN SHE'S

892
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,800
FIXING TO HAVE SEX WITH DEREK?

893
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,133
>> TO USE A CONDOM?

894
00:21:21,133 --> 00:21:24,067
I MEAN, I WAS ON BIRTH CONTROL

895
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:25,300
BUT I STOPPED TAKING IT

896
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:26,333
FOR WHATEVER REASON.

897
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:27,433
I DIDN'T LIKE THE ONE I WAS ON.

898
00:21:27,433 --> 00:21:29,367
I JUST NEVER GOT A NEW ONE.

899
00:21:29,367 --> 00:21:30,667
HE DID NOT LIKE CONDOMS

900
00:21:30,667 --> 00:21:31,833
AND I DIDN'T ARGUE ABOUT IT.

901
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,667
>> I THINK YOU SAID THAT CONDOMS

902
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:34,767
WERE LIKE PUNISHMENT.

903
00:21:34,767 --> 00:21:37,467
>> IT FEELS THAT WAY.

904
00:21:37,467 --> 00:21:39,867
>> AGAIN, I TOLD--SOMETHING

905
00:21:39,867 --> 00:21:41,100
I SAY REPEATEDLY TO YOUNG MEN

906
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:43,100
IS, PRACTICE PUTTING THEM ON,

907
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:44,567
OR PRACTICE DIFFERENT TYPES,

908
00:21:44,567 --> 00:21:46,133
FIND WHAT WORKS.

909
00:21:46,133 --> 00:21:47,067
YOU SPENT A LOT OF TIME

910
00:21:47,067 --> 00:21:48,067
DOING A LOT OF OTHER STUFF,

911
00:21:48,067 --> 00:21:48,700
HOW MANY HOURS A WEEK

912
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:50,167
DO YOU SPEND PAYING VIDEO GAMES?

913
00:21:50,167 --> 00:21:52,533
>> NOW? BARELY.

914
00:21:52,533 --> 00:21:54,333
>> OKAY, BARELY.

915
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,367
I'M JUST SAYING.

916
00:21:55,367 --> 00:21:56,500
I'M JUST SAYING THAT YOU

917
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,433
OUGHT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY.

918
00:21:57,433 --> 00:21:58,133
WHAT ARE YOU DOING NOW?

919
00:21:58,133 --> 00:22:00,500
>> I AM ON BIRTH CONTROL,

920
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:01,533
BUT I'M IN THE PROCESS

921
00:22:01,533 --> 00:22:04,067
OF CHANGING IT BECAUSE THEY

922
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:05,067
HAVE DIFFERENT KINDS

923
00:22:05,067 --> 00:22:05,967
FOR IF YOU'RE BREASTFEEDING

924
00:22:05,967 --> 00:22:07,967
WITH THE LOWER ESTROGEN.

925
00:22:07,967 --> 00:22:08,633
I'M ON THAT ONE,

926
00:22:08,633 --> 00:22:09,600
BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SWITCH.

927
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,500
>> THE PILL.

928
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:12,300
>> YES.

929
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,700
>> WELL, GOOD LUCK TO YOU GUYS

930
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,867
BACK IN MARYLAND,

931
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:16,633
AND PARTICULARLY

932
00:22:16,633 --> 00:22:17,567
WITH YOUR TRAINING.

933
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:18,300
THAT'S GONNA

934
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:18,967
MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE

935
00:22:18,967 --> 00:22:19,867
IN WHAT YOUR FINANCIAL

936
00:22:19,867 --> 00:22:20,567
OPPORTUNITIES

937
00:22:20,567 --> 00:22:21,267
ARE GONNA BE IF YOU

938
00:22:21,267 --> 00:22:22,200

939
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:22,967
SO THANK YOU FOR SHARING.

940
00:22:22,967 --> 00:22:24,400
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

941
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,400
OKAY, WHEN WE GET BACK,

942
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,067
WE WILL TALK TO SUMMER,

943
00:22:27,067 --> 00:22:28,233
AND SHE RECENTLY HAD TO DEAL

944
00:22:28,233 --> 00:22:30,867
WITH HER BABY'S FATHER CHEATING.

945
00:22:30,867 --> 00:22:32,067
AND REMEMBER, IT IS NOT ENOUGH

946
00:22:32,067 --> 00:22:33,367
TO JUST THINK ABOUT PREVENTION,

947
00:22:33,367 --> 00:22:34,233
YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO

948
00:22:34,233 --> 00:22:35,100
SOMETHING.

949
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:36,067
SO FOR MORE INFORMATION, HEAD

950
00:22:36,067 --> 00:22:39,333
OVER TO 16ANDPREGNANT.MTV.COM.

951
00:22:39,333 --> 00:22:41,367
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

952
00:22:46,333 --> 00:22:48,133
>> SITTING BESIDE ME ARE SUMMER

953
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:50,900
AND D.J., AND MY UNDERSTANDING

954
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,900
IS THAT SINCE WE LEFT OFF

955
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,567
YOUR RELATIONSHIP

956
00:22:53,567 --> 00:22:55,100
HAS BEEN A LITTLE BIT

957
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,367
TUMULTUOUS.

958
00:22:57,367 --> 00:22:58,600
WHAT HAPPENED?

959
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,367
>> OH,

960
00:22:59,367 --> 00:23:00,233
WE JUST GOT IN AN ARGUMENT.

961
00:23:00,233 --> 00:23:04,133
WHEN I SEEN HER LEAVING,

962
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:06,067
I THOUGHT WE WAS DONE

963
00:23:06,067 --> 00:23:07,833
OR WHATEVER.

964
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:09,367
I DID WHAT I DID.

965
00:23:09,367 --> 00:23:12,400
>> WHAT DID YOU DO?

966
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,833
>> WELL, I CAUGHT A GIRL

967
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:16,600
OVER TO THE HOUSE OR WHATEVER.

968
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,300
WE WAS HANGING OUT,

969
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,467
JUST CHILLING.

970
00:23:19,467 --> 00:23:20,467
>> TO HER HOUSE?

971
00:23:20,467 --> 00:23:21,300
>> YEAH.

972
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,067
>> TO YOUR HOUSE?

973
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:22,767
>> TO OUR HOUSE.

974
00:23:22,767 --> 00:23:23,833
I WALKED ME IN THE HOUSE

975
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:24,600
AND THEY WERE WALKING OUT

976
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,867
AT THE SAME TIME,

977
00:23:25,867 --> 00:23:27,233
AND SHE HAD HIS JACKET ON,

978
00:23:27,233 --> 00:23:28,200
AND I'M JUST LIKE,

979
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,267
"TAKE HIS JACKET OFF."

980
00:23:29,267 --> 00:23:30,400
AND SHE'S LIKE, "I DON'T HAVE

981
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,300
A SHIRT ON UNDERNEATH THIS."

982
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,200
AND ME NOT THINKING,

983
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:34,067
"WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SHIRT ON?"

984
00:23:34,067 --> 00:23:35,067
I'M JUST PISSED BECAUSE SHE'S

985
00:23:35,067 --> 00:23:36,800
IN MY HOUSE PERIOD, YOU KNOW.

986
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:37,700
LATER WE TALKED ABOUT IT

987
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,633
AND HE TOLD ME EVERYTHING AND--

988
00:23:39,633 --> 00:23:40,467
>> DID SHE TAKE THE JACKET OFF?

989
00:23:40,467 --> 00:23:41,167
>> YEAH, SHE TOOK HIS

990
00:23:41,167 --> 00:23:41,867
JACKET OFF.

991
00:23:41,867 --> 00:23:42,733
>> SHE DIDN'T HAVE A SHIRT ON?

992
00:23:42,733 --> 00:23:43,433
>> UH-UH.

993
00:23:43,433 --> 00:23:44,367
SHE WALKED TO HIS MAMA'S HOUSE

994
00:23:44,367 --> 00:23:45,267
IN HER BRA.

995
00:23:45,267 --> 00:23:47,233
I'M JUST LIKE, "GIRL, NO,

996
00:23:47,233 --> 00:23:49,100
LIKE, PUT YOUR SHIRT ON."

997
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,333
SHE'S TRASHY.

998
00:23:51,333 --> 00:23:52,767
SHE'S DISGUSTING.

999
00:23:52,767 --> 00:23:53,600
>> YOU'RE PRETTY FORGIVING,

1000
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,067
SUMMER.

1001
00:23:55,067 --> 00:23:56,167
>> I'M NOT OVER IT YET.

1002
00:23:56,167 --> 00:23:57,967
>> WHAT ARE YOU FEELING?

1003
00:23:57,967 --> 00:23:59,533
>> IT HURTS MY FEELINGS.

1004
00:23:59,533 --> 00:24:00,467
>> YOU SAID IT WITH A SMILE,

1005
00:24:00,467 --> 00:24:01,167
THOUGH.

1006
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:03,667
>> BECAUSE I'M GONNA CRY.

1007
00:24:03,667 --> 00:24:05,467
IT'S JUST THE FACT THAT YOU

1008
00:24:05,467 --> 00:24:07,400
HAD SEX WITH A GIRL IN MY HOUSE

1009
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:12,700
THAT WE RAISE OUR BABY IN AND--

1010
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,900
>> THAT'S GOT TO BE HARD.

1011
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,400
>> [sniffling]

1012
00:24:23,133 --> 00:24:24,200
>> YOU ARE PRETTY FORGIVING,

1013
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:26,200
THOUGH.

1014
00:24:29,733 --> 00:24:31,067
IS THAT ANGER I'M SEEING?

1015
00:24:31,067 --> 00:24:32,067
>> NO, IT JUST HURTS

1016
00:24:32,067 --> 00:24:35,400
MY FEELINGS.

1017
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,400
>> WHAT DOES D.J. NEED TO DO

1018
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:38,567
TO MAKE THAT BETTER?

1019
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:41,200
>> WELL, NOT DO IT AGAIN.

1020
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,667
THAT'S FOR SURE.

1021
00:24:46,233 --> 00:24:46,967
>> D.J., YOU KNOW IT HURTS

1022
00:24:46,967 --> 00:24:47,900
HER FEELINGS?

1023
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,300
>> YOU KNEW THAT?

1024
00:24:49,300 --> 00:24:50,300
>> YEAH, I DO.

1025
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:51,233
>> OR YOU JUST SEE THE ANGER.

1026
00:24:51,233 --> 00:24:52,400
>> I KNOW IT HURTS HER FEELINGS.

1027
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,067
I'D BE THE SAME WAY, YOU KNOW.

1028
00:24:54,067 --> 00:24:57,967
THE ONLY THING WE CAN DO IS MOVE

1029
00:24:57,967 --> 00:24:59,267
FORWARD FROM HERE, YOU KNOW?

1030
00:24:59,267 --> 00:25:00,767
>> HAVE YOU APOLOGIZED?

1031
00:25:00,767 --> 00:25:02,067
>> A MILLION TIMES.

1032
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:02,967
>> A MILLION TIMES, GOOD.

1033
00:25:02,967 --> 00:25:05,700
THAT'S WHAT IT NEEDS.

1034
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,367
ARE YOU ACCEPTING

1035
00:25:06,367 --> 00:25:07,133
OF THE APOLOGY,

1036
00:25:07,133 --> 00:25:08,067
TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CAN?

1037
00:25:08,067 --> 00:25:08,700
>> I TRY.

1038
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:09,400
>> I'M TELLING YOU,

1039
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,233
IT TAKES MORE THAN AN APOLOGY.

1040
00:25:10,233 --> 00:25:10,900
IT TAKES SHOWING IT,

1041
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:11,567
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

1042
00:25:11,567 --> 00:25:12,233
>> YEAH.

1043
00:25:12,233 --> 00:25:13,733
YOU GOT TO REBUILD THE TRUST.

1044
00:25:13,733 --> 00:25:14,833
>> DO YOU TRUST HIM NOW?

1045
00:25:14,833 --> 00:25:15,533
>> UH-UH.

1046
00:25:15,533 --> 00:25:17,267
>> NO, HOW OLD WERE YOU GUYS

1047
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:18,767
WHEN YOU GOT MARRIED?

1048
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:19,633
>> I WAS 16.

1049
00:25:19,633 --> 00:25:21,533
>> OH, IT'S A LOT.

1050
00:25:21,533 --> 00:25:22,667
FOR PEOPLE TO CHEAT

1051
00:25:22,667 --> 00:25:23,800
ON BOYFRIENDS AND GIRLFRIENDS

1052
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,567
IN YOUR AGE GROUP

1053
00:25:24,567 --> 00:25:26,700
IS NOT UNUSUAL,

1054
00:25:26,700 --> 00:25:27,533
BUT WHEN YOU'RE MARRIED

1055
00:25:27,533 --> 00:25:28,467
AND HAVE A KID INVOLVED,

1056
00:25:28,467 --> 00:25:29,233
YOU DON'T GET

1057
00:25:29,233 --> 00:25:30,967
TO MAKE THOSE MISTAKES.

1058
00:25:30,967 --> 00:25:31,867
WELL, SUMMER AND D.J.

1059
00:25:31,867 --> 00:25:32,933
ARE MOVING FORWARD.

1060
00:25:32,933 --> 00:25:33,767
SHE'S GONNA FORGIVE HIM.

1061
00:25:33,767 --> 00:25:34,500
HE'S GONNA REBUILD

1062
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,533
THAT TRUST,

1063
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,100
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP

1064
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,067
WITH SUMMER'S MOM

1065
00:25:38,067 --> 00:25:38,900
WHICH WAS STRAINED

1066
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,100
BY AN ADDICTION TO PILLS?

1067
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,600
HERE'S A QUICK REMINDER OF

1068
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,467
WHAT SUMMER HAD

1069
00:25:42,467 --> 00:25:45,767
BEEN DEALING WITH.

1070
00:25:45,767 --> 00:25:46,800
>> WHEN YOU'RE MESSED UP I JUST

1071
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:47,700
DON'T WANT TO BE AROUND YOU.

1072
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,567
>> PILLS CAN TAKE YOU DOWN

1073
00:25:48,567 --> 00:25:49,967
A ROAD YOU DON'T WANT TO GO.

1074
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:50,900
>> QUIT IT, MOM.

1075
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:51,567
>> KISS ME.

1076
00:25:51,567 --> 00:25:52,300
>> [bleep]

1077
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:55,667
MAMA IS SO MESSED UP,

1078
00:25:55,667 --> 00:25:56,333
I DON'T EVEN WANT

1079
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:57,467
TO GO IN THIS RESTAURANT.

1080
00:25:57,467 --> 00:26:00,767
>> I'M JUST EMBARRASSED.

1081
00:26:10,767 --> 00:26:11,600
>> I LIKE HOW YOU'RE PAYING

1082
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,200
FOR A PIT BULL

1083
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:12,867
INSTEAD OF PAYING

1084
00:26:12,867 --> 00:26:14,067
FOR SOMETHING FOR PEYTON.

1085
00:26:14,067 --> 00:26:15,167
>> I LIKE HOW YOU EVEN

1086
00:26:15,167 --> 00:26:17,267
GOT A SAY-SO IN ANY OF THIS.

1087
00:26:17,267 --> 00:26:20,767
THIS AIN'T NO FAIRY TALE.

1088
00:26:20,767 --> 00:26:21,633
>> NOW, SUMMER, YOU MOM

1089
00:26:21,633 --> 00:26:23,133
WAS SUPPOSED TO JOIN US TODAY,

1090
00:26:23,133 --> 00:26:24,667
RIGHT; WHAT HAPPENED?

1091
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:25,900
>> SEE, YOU CANNOT DEPEND

1092
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:26,600
ON HER FOR ANYTHING.

1093
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,133
I MEAN, I DON'T CARE.

1094
00:26:29,133 --> 00:26:30,700
IT HURTS MY FEELINGS, BUT SHE'S

1095
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,433
DONE IT SINCE I WAS, LIKE, NINE.

1096
00:26:32,433 --> 00:26:33,600
>> IT MEANING PILLS.

1097
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,667
>> YES.

1098
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:36,300
>> IN THAT EPISODE WE SAW HER

1099
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,967
FACING A COUPLE OF YEARS IN JAIL

1100
00:26:37,967 --> 00:26:39,133
FOR THE BAD CHECKS.

1101
00:26:39,133 --> 00:26:40,067
>> YES, SHE ENDED UP JUST

1102
00:26:40,067 --> 00:26:41,633
GETTING TEN YEARS OF PROBATION.

1103
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:43,500
>> WHAT KINDS OF CONSEQUENCES

1104
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:46,267
HAS HER PILL USE HAD ON YOU?

1105
00:26:46,267 --> 00:26:47,067
>> JUST THAT I DIDN'T GET

1106
00:26:47,067 --> 00:26:47,767
TO SEE HER.

1107
00:26:47,767 --> 00:26:48,833
IT HURT ME THAT I DIDN'T GET

1108
00:26:48,833 --> 00:26:50,400
TO GROW UP WITH MY MAMA.

1109
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,767
>> AND DID SHE DO SOMETHING

1110
00:26:52,767 --> 00:26:53,467
THAT CAUSED HER TO BE

1111
00:26:53,467 --> 00:26:54,600
TAKEN AWAY FROM YOU?

1112
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,500
>> NOPE, SHE JUST TOOK ME

1113
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,300
TO MY DADDY'S AND SAID--

1114
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:57,400
>> OH, SHE WAS UNLOADING YOU.

1115
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:58,067
>> OH, YEAH, SHE SAID,

1116
00:26:58,067 --> 00:26:59,267
"HERE, YOU TAKE CARE OF HER.

1117
00:26:59,267 --> 00:27:00,133
I DON'T WANT TO BE A MOMMY

1118
00:27:00,133 --> 00:27:01,300
ANYMORE."

1119
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:02,833
>> WOW.

1120
00:27:02,833 --> 00:27:03,500
>> CAN YOU IMAGINE

1121
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,200
DOING THAT WITH PEYTON?

1122
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,900
>> NO, I CAN'T.

1123
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,133
IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY

1124
00:27:07,133 --> 00:27:08,733
BEING AWAY FROM HIM RIGHT NOW.

1125
00:27:08,733 --> 00:27:09,867
>> YOU HAVE, AS YOU SAID,

1126
00:27:09,867 --> 00:27:11,067
THE YOUNGER HALF-SISTERS.

1127
00:27:11,067 --> 00:27:11,967
>> MM-HMM.

1128
00:27:11,967 --> 00:27:13,067
>> YOU GOT PREGNANT.

1129
00:27:13,067 --> 00:27:13,767
HAVE YOU TALKED TO THEM

1130
00:27:13,767 --> 00:27:14,567
ABOUT BIRTH CONTROL

1131
00:27:14,567 --> 00:27:16,067
OR HOW TO AVOID THIS?

1132
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:18,500
>> YES, TYLER, THE MIDDLE ONE,

1133
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:20,433
I THINK HER AND THE YOUNGEST

1134
00:27:20,433 --> 00:27:21,533
GOT ON THE DEPO SHOT,

1135
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:22,200
BUT I DON'T KNOW

1136
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:22,900
ABOUT MY OTHER SISTER.

1137
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:23,667
>> WEREN'T YOU ON DEPO

1138
00:27:23,667 --> 00:27:24,300
AT ONE TIME?

1139
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:25,733
>> NO, I WAS ON THE IMPLANON.

1140
00:27:25,733 --> 00:27:26,500
>> IMPLANON.

1141
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,500
WHEN YOU GOT PREGNANT?

1142
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:29,467
NO, I HAD GOT IT TAKEN OUT.

1143
00:27:29,467 --> 00:27:31,200
I THINK IT WAS TIME UP FOR IT.

1144
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:31,867
AND NOW I JUST

1145
00:27:31,867 --> 00:27:32,567
STARTED TAKING THE PILL,

1146
00:27:32,567 --> 00:27:33,333
BUT I ALWAYS FORGOT

1147
00:27:33,333 --> 00:27:34,567
TO TAKE THE PILL,

1148
00:27:34,567 --> 00:27:36,933
SO WE WERE USING CONDOMS, TOO,

1149
00:27:36,933 --> 00:27:39,467
BUT IT DIDN'T WORK OUT.

1150
00:27:39,467 --> 00:27:40,567
>> WHAT ARE YOU TAKING NOW?

1151
00:27:40,567 --> 00:27:42,167
>> I'M ON THE NEW MIRENA,

1152
00:27:42,167 --> 00:27:43,233
BUT I DON'T LIKE IT SO I THINK

1153
00:27:43,233 --> 00:27:44,833
I'M GONNA GET THE DEPO SHOT

1154
00:27:44,833 --> 00:27:46,067
NEXT TIME.

1155
00:27:46,067 --> 00:27:47,600
>> NOW, I KNOW YOU'RE WORRIED

1156
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,633
ABOUT THE CYCLE OF ADDICTION.

1157
00:27:48,633 --> 00:27:49,700
THE GENETICS OF ADDICTION,

1158
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:50,367
DO YOU FEEL

1159
00:27:50,367 --> 00:27:51,667
LIKE YOU HAVE THAT POTENTIAL?

1160
00:27:51,667 --> 00:27:52,433
>> YES, I WOULDN'T EVEN

1161
00:27:52,433 --> 00:27:54,267
TAKE PAIN MEDICATION AFTERWARDS.

1162
00:27:54,267 --> 00:27:54,933
AFTER MY LABOR, YES.

1163
00:27:54,933 --> 00:27:56,133
>> AFTER THE PREGNANCY.

1164
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:56,900
DID YOU HAVE AN EPIDURAL

1165
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,567
OR ANYTHING?

1166
00:27:57,567 --> 00:27:58,333
>> I DID, BUT I GOT IT

1167
00:27:58,333 --> 00:27:59,067
AT EIGHT CENTIMETERS

1168
00:27:59,067 --> 00:27:59,733
SO IT DIDN'T KICK

1169
00:27:59,733 --> 00:28:01,500
IN UNTIL AFTER I HAD PEYTON.

1170
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,733
IT WAS LIKE A NATURAL LABOR.

1171
00:28:02,733 --> 00:28:03,767
AND THEN AFTERWARDS, MY LEGS

1172
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:04,733
WERE NUMB THE WHOLE TIME.

1173
00:28:04,733 --> 00:28:05,400
>> OH, NO.

1174
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:06,967
>> IT WAS AWFUL.

1175
00:28:06,967 --> 00:28:07,733
>> D.J., HOW DO YOU FIND

1176
00:28:07,733 --> 00:28:09,667
BEING A DAD?

1177
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:10,667
>> I LOVE IT, MAN.

1178
00:28:10,667 --> 00:28:12,233
IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE I GOT

1179
00:28:12,233 --> 00:28:13,667
A MEANING, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

1180
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:14,600
>> A PURPOSE, YEAH.

1181
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,300
NO MORE SCREWING AROUND.

1182
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,733
YOU SAID HE APOLOGIZED

1183
00:28:17,733 --> 00:28:18,967
A MILLION TIMES?

1184
00:28:18,967 --> 00:28:19,767
>> PROBABLY MORE THAN THAT.

1185
00:28:19,767 --> 00:28:20,500
>> MORE THAN A MILLION.

1186
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:21,433
GOOD. JUST CHECKING.

1187
00:28:21,433 --> 00:28:25,100
I DO BELIEVE HIM WHEN HE SAYS--

1188
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,167
>> I THINK HE'S SORRY TOO.

1189
00:28:26,167 --> 00:28:27,500
I KNOW HE REGRETS IT

1190
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,233
BECAUSE WE'VE TALKED

1191
00:28:28,233 --> 00:28:28,933
ABOUT IT SO MANY TIMES.

1192
00:28:28,933 --> 00:28:30,133
MY ONLY REGRET IS JUST THE FACT

1193
00:28:30,133 --> 00:28:30,933
THAT IT HAPPENED, YOU KNOW.

1194
00:28:30,933 --> 00:28:33,733
I THOUGHT I MEANT MORE TO YOU.

1195
00:28:33,733 --> 00:28:35,800
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

1196
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:36,700
>> AND I SURELY HOPE

1197
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:38,567
YOU USED A CONDOM THAT TIME.

1198
00:28:38,567 --> 00:28:39,133
>> YEAH, I DID.

1199
00:28:39,133 --> 00:28:40,233
>> YEAH.

1200
00:28:40,233 --> 00:28:42,867
>> I'M SORRY, BABE.

1201
00:28:42,867 --> 00:28:43,633
KISS ME.

1202
00:28:43,633 --> 00:28:44,600
>> OH.

1203
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,733
SHE DOESN'T LIKE

1204
00:28:45,733 --> 00:28:46,800
TO ACCEPT THE APOLOGY.

1205
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,467
COME ON NOW.

1206
00:28:47,467 --> 00:28:48,433
>> YOU GONNA KISS ME?

1207
00:28:48,433 --> 00:28:49,700
>> ACCEPT IT.

1208
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,900
>> I ACCEPT YOUR APOLOGY. OKAY.

1209
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:56,867
I HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR YOU GUYS.

1210
00:28:56,867 --> 00:28:59,067
DON'T LET ME DOWN. ALL RIGHT.

1211
00:28:59,067 --> 00:29:00,433
COMING UP, WERE GONNA FIND OUT

1212
00:29:00,433 --> 00:29:01,767
IF AUTUMN'S BOYFRIEND, DUSTIN,

1213
00:29:01,767 --> 00:29:03,933
HAS REALLY KICKED THE WEED HABIT

1214
00:29:03,933 --> 00:29:05,067
AND WE'LL TALK TO COURTNEY

1215
00:29:05,067 --> 00:29:06,333
ABOUT HOW HER PLEDGE

1216
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:08,167
TO GIVE UP SEX HAS CAUSED

1217
00:29:08,167 --> 00:29:09,233
A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH

1218
00:29:09,233 --> 00:29:11,667
HER RELATIONSHIP WITH SCOTT.

1219
00:29:19,967 --> 00:29:20,867
>> WELCOME BACK.

1220
00:29:20,867 --> 00:29:22,900
I'M HERE WITH AUTUMN AND DUSTIN.

1221
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,733
WE'RE GONNA START WITH YOU,

1222
00:29:23,733 --> 00:29:24,500
AUTUMN, FIRST.

1223
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:25,700
SO, IT SEEMED LIKE WHEN WE MET

1224
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:26,700
YOUR BOYFRIEND, DUSTIN, HE

1225
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:27,767
SEEMED A LITTLE MORE INTERESTED

1226
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:28,500
IN SMOKING WEED

1227
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,667
THAN IN BEING A FATHER,

1228
00:29:29,667 --> 00:29:31,133
BUT DESPITE COOLING OUT

1229
00:29:31,133 --> 00:29:33,133
HIS POT HABIT A LITTLE BIT,

1230
00:29:33,133 --> 00:29:34,233
HE DIDN'T QUITE BECOME

1231
00:29:34,233 --> 00:29:35,133
THE RESPONSIBLE DAD

1232
00:29:35,133 --> 00:29:36,267
AUTUMN HAD HOPED FOR.

1233
00:29:36,267 --> 00:29:38,767
TAKE A LOOK.

1234
00:29:38,767 --> 00:29:39,500
>> ARE YOU HIGH?

1235
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,500
>> NOT EVEN CLOSE.

1236
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,933
>> YOU'RE LYING.

1237
00:29:41,933 --> 00:29:42,800
>> IF SOMEBODY COMES OVER

1238
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:43,633
AND THEY GOT WEED,

1239
00:29:43,633 --> 00:29:44,467
SURE, I'M GONNA TAKE A HIT.

1240
00:29:44,467 --> 00:29:45,433
>> NOT IN MY HOME.

1241
00:29:45,433 --> 00:29:46,633
IT'S ILLEGAL.

1242
00:29:46,633 --> 00:29:47,333
>> WHAT ARE YOU TALKING

1243
00:29:47,333 --> 00:29:48,867
ABOUT COPS ARE COMING?

1244
00:29:48,867 --> 00:29:52,067
DEDE CALLED THE COPS ON DUSTIN.

1245
00:29:52,067 --> 00:29:56,367
>> AHHH!

1246
00:29:56,367 --> 00:29:57,433
>> CAN YOU BE A PARENT INSTEAD

1247
00:29:57,433 --> 00:29:59,400
OF A TEENAGER FOR FIVE SECONDS?

1248
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,000
>> I FILED FOR CHILD SUPPORT.

1249
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,000
>> YOU'RE ANNOYING.

1250
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,467
>> I'M ANNOYING?

1251
00:30:03,467 --> 00:30:04,967
SCREW YOU.

1252
00:30:04,967 --> 00:30:05,733
LOOK, HONESTLY,

1253
00:30:05,733 --> 00:30:09,467
YOU PISSED ME OFF WITH THAT ONE.

1254
00:30:09,467 --> 00:30:11,167
>> ALL RIGHT, SO...

1255
00:30:11,167 --> 00:30:11,833
HOW ARE THINGS

1256
00:30:11,833 --> 00:30:13,867
GOING BETWEEN YOU TWO NOW?

1257
00:30:13,867 --> 00:30:14,533
>> PRETTY GOOD.

1258
00:30:14,533 --> 00:30:15,200
>> YEAH.

1259
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,267
>> A LOT BETTER THAN BEFORE.

1260
00:30:16,267 --> 00:30:17,500
>> OH, YEAH.

1261
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,833
>> DID YOU BREAK UP?

1262
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:20,300
>> WE'VE BROKEN UP A FEW TIMES,

1263
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:21,333
BUT WE'RE TOGETHER NOW.

1264
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:22,900
>> A FEW TIMES?

1265
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,933
WHAT, LIKE EVERY WEEK YOU GUYS

1266
00:30:23,933 --> 00:30:24,600
BREAK UP?

1267
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:25,300
>> NO.

1268
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:26,033
>> ABOUT ONCE EVERY THREE

1269
00:30:26,033 --> 00:30:26,767
MONTHS.

1270
00:30:26,767 --> 00:30:27,633
>> ONCE EVERY THREE MONTHS.

1271
00:30:27,633 --> 00:30:29,067
IS IT ALWAYS ABOUT MONEY?

1272
00:30:29,067 --> 00:30:29,867
>> NO. NEVER.

1273
00:30:29,867 --> 00:30:30,700
>> IT'S DIFFERENT [bleep]

1274
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,367
EVERY TIME.

1275
00:30:31,367 --> 00:30:32,300
>> IT'S NEVER BEEN ABOUT MONEY,

1276
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:32,967
THOUGH.

1277
00:30:32,967 --> 00:30:33,867
>> IT'S NEVER BEEN ABOUT MONEY?

1278
00:30:33,867 --> 00:30:34,533
>> NO.

1279
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:35,367
>> IN THE EPISODE IT SEEMED

1280
00:30:35,367 --> 00:30:36,933
LIKE MONEY WAS A BIG PROBLEM,

1281
00:30:36,933 --> 00:30:37,967
THAT HE'D NEVER BE ABLE

1282
00:30:37,967 --> 00:30:39,333
TO GET YOU WHAT YOU NEEDED.

1283
00:30:39,333 --> 00:30:41,333
>> WE NEVER REALLY BROKE UP

1284
00:30:41,333 --> 00:30:42,067
BECAUSE OF IT,

1285
00:30:42,067 --> 00:30:43,433
BUT OF COURSE

1286
00:30:43,433 --> 00:30:44,267
WE FOUGHT ABOUT IT.

1287
00:30:44,267 --> 00:30:45,833
IT'S A BIG DEAL,

1288
00:30:45,833 --> 00:30:48,033
BUT, I MEAN, THE MONEY PROBLEM

1289
00:30:48,033 --> 00:30:49,433
ISN'T AS BIG NOW.

1290
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:50,500
HE HAS A FULL-TIME JOB

1291
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,667
PLUS ANOTHER JOB.

1292
00:30:51,667 --> 00:30:53,567
>> GOOD.

1293
00:30:53,567 --> 00:30:54,267
>> HIS SECOND JOB

1294
00:30:54,267 --> 00:30:55,500
HE UMPIRES A LITTLE LEAGUE GAME.

1295
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,467
>> OH, THAT'S COOL.

1296
00:30:56,467 --> 00:30:58,933
>> WHY DID YOU BREAK UP?

1297
00:30:58,933 --> 00:30:59,633
>> YOU WANT TO TELL HIM

1298
00:30:59,633 --> 00:31:00,400
THAT ONE?

1299
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:01,233
>> I DON'T REMEMBER

1300
00:31:01,233 --> 00:31:02,067
THE LAST TIME.

1301
00:31:02,067 --> 00:31:02,900
>> HE'S A CHEATER.

1302
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,800
>> HE'S A CHEATER?

1303
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:04,900
>> YEAH.

1304
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,100
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

1305
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:06,767
>> HOW MANY TIMES

1306
00:31:06,767 --> 00:31:07,467
HAS HE CHEATED?

1307
00:31:07,467 --> 00:31:08,167
>> TWICE.

1308
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:11,633
>> TWICE?

1309
00:31:11,633 --> 00:31:12,933
>> I WAS PREGNANT WITH BOTH,

1310
00:31:12,933 --> 00:31:14,067
AND THEN HAVING DRAKE

1311
00:31:14,067 --> 00:31:15,200
AND AFTER DRAKE WAS BORN

1312
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,733
UNTIL HE WAS A MONTH OLD.

1313
00:31:16,733 --> 00:31:17,400
>> HOW DO YOU SMILE

1314
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,667
AND SAY THAT?

1315
00:31:18,667 --> 00:31:20,267
>> IT'S A SMART ASS SMILE.

1316
00:31:20,267 --> 00:31:21,900
>> IT'S HIDING SOMETHING.

1317
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:23,100
>> NO, IT'S JUST AN ANNOYED,

1318
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:27,067
LIKE, LITTLE BITCH SMILE.

1319
00:31:27,067 --> 00:31:29,500
>> IT STILL SEEMS

1320
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:30,267
IT MAKES YOU SAD.

1321
00:31:30,267 --> 00:31:31,267
IT HURTS. IT HAS TO.

1322
00:31:31,267 --> 00:31:31,967
>> WELL, YEAH.

1323
00:31:31,967 --> 00:31:33,933
OH, YEAH.

1324
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:34,600
>> HAS HE EVER

1325
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:35,633
APOLOGIZED FOR THIS?

1326
00:31:35,633 --> 00:31:36,300
>> OH, YEAH.

1327
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:37,800
I DON'T THINK HE CARES, THOUGH.

1328
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:38,467
>> WHAT?

1329
00:31:38,467 --> 00:31:39,900
>> I APOLOGIZE ALL THE TIME,

1330
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:43,167
AND YOU KNOW I DO.

1331
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:43,867
>> YOU CHEATED

1332
00:31:43,867 --> 00:31:44,700
DURING THE PREGNANCY?

1333
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:45,367
>> YEAH.

1334
00:31:45,367 --> 00:31:46,100
>> TWICE.

1335
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,200
AND AFTER DRAKE WAS BORN.

1336
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,267
>> DUDE.

1337
00:31:50,267 --> 00:31:51,433
>> SHE MAKES ME MAD SOMETIMES.

1338
00:31:51,433 --> 00:31:52,100
>> OH.

1339
00:31:52,100 --> 00:31:54,067
>> I KNEW THE GIRL TOO.

1340
00:31:54,067 --> 00:31:56,567
WE HAD HUNG OUT.

1341
00:31:56,567 --> 00:31:59,733
AND SHE HAD ACTUALLY CAME TO ME

1342
00:31:59,733 --> 00:32:00,800
AND TOLD ME ABOUT IT

1343
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:02,867
ONCE WE HAD BROKEN UP.

1344
00:32:02,867 --> 00:32:04,967
AND THEN LATER ON WE GOT BACK

1345
00:32:04,967 --> 00:32:06,767
TOGETHER AND I WENT THROUGH--

1346
00:32:06,767 --> 00:32:07,767
IT WAS AFTER DRAKE WAS BORN,

1347
00:32:07,767 --> 00:32:09,733
I WENT THROUGH HIS PHONE AGAIN,

1348
00:32:09,733 --> 00:32:11,533
AND FOUND MORE TEXT MESSAGES

1349
00:32:11,533 --> 00:32:13,333
OF HIM PLANNING ON SMOKING

1350
00:32:13,333 --> 00:32:14,833
AND [bleep] ANOTHER GIRL.

1351
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:17,067
>> I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND

1352
00:32:17,067 --> 00:32:18,400
WHAT WAS GOING ON.

1353
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,233
YOU HAVE SOMEONE

1354
00:32:20,233 --> 00:32:21,133
CARRYING YOUR BABY.

1355
00:32:21,133 --> 00:32:22,900
>> HE SAID I WAS CONTROLLING

1356
00:32:22,900 --> 00:32:23,900
BECAUSE I KEPT TRYING

1357
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:26,067
TO GET HIM TO STOP SMOKING POT.

1358
00:32:26,067 --> 00:32:27,467
AND WE CONSTANTLY FIGHT.

1359
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:29,067
AND IT GOT REALLY BAD.

1360
00:32:29,067 --> 00:32:29,800
>> OVER THE POT?

1361
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,733
>> YES. REALLY BAD,

1362
00:32:30,733 --> 00:32:35,500
LIKE HORRIBLE AND HE CHEATED.

1363
00:32:35,500 --> 00:32:36,333
>> AND YOU'VE FORGIVEN HIM

1364
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:37,133
FOR ALL OF THAT?

1365
00:32:37,133 --> 00:32:37,800
>> NO.

1366
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:39,467
>> SHE'S NOT FORGIVEN YOU.

1367
00:32:39,467 --> 00:32:41,233
>> NOT FORGIVEN, BUT TRYING

1368
00:32:41,233 --> 00:32:43,300
TO LOOK PAST IT FOR DRAKE.

1369
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,167
>> AND HOW DID YOU GET HIM

1370
00:32:44,167 --> 00:32:44,900
FROM A GUY

1371
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,167
WHO WAS NOT GIVING YOU MUCH

1372
00:32:46,167 --> 00:32:47,400
OF ANYTHING,

1373
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,433
WHOM YOU WERE FIGHTING WITH,

1374
00:32:48,433 --> 00:32:49,433
WHO WAS CHEATING ON YOU,

1375
00:32:49,433 --> 00:32:50,633
TO A GUY THAT'S NOW COMMITTED,

1376
00:32:50,633 --> 00:32:51,300
AND WORKING,

1377
00:32:51,300 --> 00:32:52,867
AND LIVING WITH YOU.

1378
00:32:52,867 --> 00:32:53,800
>> HE HAD NOWHERE TO GO,

1379
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,067
SO HE MOVED IN AND MY MOM

1380
00:32:55,067 --> 00:32:56,300
SAID HE WAS NOT LIVING THERE

1381
00:32:56,300 --> 00:32:57,300
FOR FREE.

1382
00:32:57,300 --> 00:32:59,767
SO SHE KIND OF FORCED

1383
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:01,067
HIM TO GET A JOB.

1384
00:33:01,067 --> 00:33:04,100
>> HOW YOU DOING WITH THE WEED?

1385
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:05,400
>> PRETTY MUCH I SMOKE WEED

1386
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,967
ALL DAY EVERY DAY,

1387
00:33:06,967 --> 00:33:08,800
AND I DON'T GIVE A [bleep].

1388
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,700
>> YOU SEE YOUR GIRLFRIEND,

1389
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,533
IS THAT WHAT YOUR OFFICIAL

1390
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:12,400
STATUS IS NOW?

1391
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,133
DO I CALL YOU GIRLFRIEND?

1392
00:33:13,133 --> 00:33:15,067
>> MM-HMM.

1393
00:33:15,067 --> 00:33:16,567
>> YOU SEE IT BOTHERS HER.

1394
00:33:16,567 --> 00:33:17,667
>> SHE HATES THE STUFF.

1395
00:33:17,667 --> 00:33:18,367
CAN'T STAND IT.

1396
00:33:18,367 --> 00:33:19,233
BUT I DON'T DO IT AROUND HER.

1397
00:33:19,233 --> 00:33:20,067
>> I TOLD HIM THE NEXT TIME

1398
00:33:20,067 --> 00:33:21,200
I CATCH HIM DOING IT,

1399
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,367
ME AND DRAKE ARE GONE.

1400
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:24,467
HE CAN GET OUT OF MY HOUSE THEN.

1401
00:33:24,467 --> 00:33:25,233
SO...

1402
00:33:25,233 --> 00:33:27,467
>> IS THIS GONNA WORK OUT?

1403
00:33:27,467 --> 00:33:29,067
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1404
00:33:29,067 --> 00:33:31,567
TAKING IT DAY BY DAY.

1405
00:33:31,567 --> 00:33:32,867
IT HURTS NOT TO HAVE A PARENT

1406
00:33:32,867 --> 00:33:33,600
THERE.

1407
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:35,167
YOU SHOULD HAVE BOTH.

1408
00:33:35,167 --> 00:33:37,733
IT'S NEVER THE KID'S FAULT,

1409
00:33:37,733 --> 00:33:38,633
REALLY.

1410
00:33:38,633 --> 00:33:39,667
I MEAN, I'VE NEVER SEEN A CASE

1411
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:40,333
THAT IT WAS.

1412
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:41,067
SO WHEN A KID

1413
00:33:41,067 --> 00:33:43,100
LOSES THEIR PARENT BECAUSE--

1414
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:43,933
>> SO HAVE YOU FORGIVEN

1415
00:33:43,933 --> 00:33:44,600
YOURSELF,

1416
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:45,867
WHATEVER THOSE FEELINGS

1417
00:33:45,867 --> 00:33:47,233
WERE AS A KID?

1418
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,900
HOW DID YOU GET THROUGH THAT?

1419
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:49,933
>> MY MOM WAS A MOM

1420
00:33:49,933 --> 00:33:50,900
AND A DAD TO ME.

1421
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:51,967
SHE WAS LIKE MY SUPERHERO.

1422
00:33:51,967 --> 00:33:53,200
I DON'T KNOW HOW SHE DID IT.

1423
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:54,867
FOUR KIDS ON HER OWN.

1424
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:55,600
>> ISN'T THAT CRAZY?

1425
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,500
>> SHE'S MY ROLE MODEL.

1426
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:58,267
THAT'S WHO I LOOK UP TO.

1427
00:33:58,267 --> 00:33:59,767
I SEE HER AND I THINK TO MYSELF,

1428
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:01,067
"I CAN DO IT TOO."

1429
00:34:01,067 --> 00:34:01,967
>> NOW YOUR OLDER SISTER

1430
00:34:01,967 --> 00:34:02,667
HAD A BABY, TOO,

1431
00:34:02,667 --> 00:34:04,067
JUST BEFORE YOU DID.

1432
00:34:04,067 --> 00:34:04,733
>> MM-HMM.

1433
00:34:04,733 --> 00:34:05,833
>> HAVING SEEN HER GET PREGNANT,

1434
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:06,900
WOULDN'T THAT HAVE MOTIVATED

1435
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,100
YOU TO BE MORE CAREFUL?

1436
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,467
>> SHOULD HAVE, BUT IT DIDN'T.

1437
00:34:09,467 --> 00:34:11,100
>> DIDN'T HAVE ANY EFFECT?

1438
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:11,800
>> I DIDN'T THINK

1439
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,467
IT COULD HAPPEN TO ME,

1440
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,933
LIKE A STUPID LITTLE TEENAGER,

1441
00:34:13,933 --> 00:34:15,667
LIKE MOST KIDS DO.

1442
00:34:15,667 --> 00:34:16,733
>> HOW WOULD YOU SAY YOUR LIFE

1443
00:34:16,733 --> 00:34:18,867
HAS CHANGED SINCE GIVING BIRTH?

1444
00:34:18,867 --> 00:34:19,600
>> BIG TIME.

1445
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:22,967
I USED TO BE THE PARTY KID

1446
00:34:22,967 --> 00:34:24,067
THAT, YOU KNOW, HUNG OUT

1447
00:34:24,067 --> 00:34:25,900
WITH EVERYBODY, DID EVERYTHING,

1448
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,100
LOVED DOING ANYTHING FUN.

1449
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,067
IT WAS JUST SPUR OF THE MOMENT.

1450
00:34:31,067 --> 00:34:32,433
DIDN'T REALLY CARE

1451
00:34:32,433 --> 00:34:33,467
ABOUT ANYTHING.

1452
00:34:33,467 --> 00:34:35,433
NOW I STAY HOME, TAKE CARE

1453
00:34:35,433 --> 00:34:36,933
OF A FIVE-MONTH-OLD.

1454
00:34:36,933 --> 00:34:38,633
I USED TO DRESS UP ALL THE TIME,

1455
00:34:38,633 --> 00:34:40,400
DO MY MAKEUP AND HAIR.

1456
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,133
YOU CAN COME OVER, I'M

1457
00:34:41,133 --> 00:34:42,767
IN MY PJ'S, PUKE ALL OVER ME,

1458
00:34:42,767 --> 00:34:43,933
HAIR UP IN A MESSY BUN,

1459
00:34:43,933 --> 00:34:46,433
NO MAKEUP, PALE AS CAN BE

1460
00:34:46,433 --> 00:34:48,167
BECAUSE I'M ALWAYS INSIDE.

1461
00:34:48,167 --> 00:34:50,433
I DON'T TALK TO NO ONE.

1462
00:34:50,433 --> 00:34:51,400
I DON'T HAVE FRIENDS.

1463
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:52,400
I DON'T WANT FRIENDS.

1464
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,067
THE FRIENDS I HAD PARTIED

1465
00:34:55,067 --> 00:34:57,400
AND DID THINGS TEENAGERS

1466
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,233
CAN HAVE FUN DOING,

1467
00:34:58,233 --> 00:34:59,867
BUT PARENTS SHOULDN'T

1468
00:34:59,867 --> 00:35:01,533
BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'M A PARENT,

1469
00:35:01,533 --> 00:35:02,200
AND I DON'T WANT

1470
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,067
TO BE LIKE THAT.

1471
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:04,767
SO IN MY EYES, THE BEST CHOICE

1472
00:35:04,767 --> 00:35:06,200
IS TO JUST TAKE CARE

1473
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:06,933
OF YOUR KID.

1474
00:35:06,933 --> 00:35:08,267
YOU'RE A TEENAGER,

1475
00:35:08,267 --> 00:35:09,233
IT'S VERY EASY

1476
00:35:09,233 --> 00:35:10,833
TO BACK IN THE WRONG CROWD.

1477
00:35:10,833 --> 00:35:12,767
>> WELL SAID. THANK YOU.

1478
00:35:12,767 --> 00:35:14,267
WE HAVE TO TAKE A QUICK BREAK.

1479
00:35:14,267 --> 00:35:14,933
DON'T GO AWAY.

1480
00:35:14,933 --> 00:35:16,933
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

1481
00:35:21,667 --> 00:35:22,967
>> WELCOME BACK.

1482
00:35:22,967 --> 00:35:24,067
NOW, CERTAIN METHODS OF BIRTH

1483
00:35:24,067 --> 00:35:25,533
CONTROL, SUCH AS I.U.D.s,

1484
00:35:25,533 --> 00:35:27,267
ARE OVER 99% EFFECTIVE

1485
00:35:27,267 --> 00:35:28,767
IN PREVENTING PREGNANCY.

1486
00:35:28,767 --> 00:35:29,833
IF YOU REALLY WANT TO BE SURE

1487
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:30,933
YOU WON'T GET PREGNANT,

1488
00:35:30,933 --> 00:35:32,700
YOU CAN ALWAYS NOT HAVE SEX.

1489
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,133
COURTNEY PLANNED TO SAVE HERSELF

1490
00:35:34,133 --> 00:35:35,300
TILL AFTER MARRIAGE,

1491
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,233
BUT ENDED UP BREAKING

1492
00:35:36,233 --> 00:35:37,767
THAT PLEDGE WITH SCOTT.

1493
00:35:37,767 --> 00:35:38,633
LET'S GO AHEAD AND LOOK BACK

1494
00:35:38,633 --> 00:35:39,733
AT THE CONSEQUENCES

1495
00:35:39,733 --> 00:35:43,500
OF THAT DECISION.

1496
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,467
>> IT TOOK FOUR DOCTORS JUST

1497
00:35:45,467 --> 00:35:47,133
TO SAY IT DOES HAVE A CLUB FOOT.

1498
00:35:47,133 --> 00:35:48,333
>> BECAUSE THEY CAN'T TELL HOW

1499
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:51,267
SEVERE IT IS UNTIL HE'S BORN.

1500
00:35:51,267 --> 00:35:53,133
AHHHH!

1501
00:35:53,133 --> 00:35:56,333
I FEEL LIKE A PART OF IT

1502
00:35:56,333 --> 00:35:57,200
IS MY FAULT

1503
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,800
FOR PASSING ON THE CLUB FOOT.

1504
00:35:58,800 --> 00:35:59,767
>> THAT GUILT,

1505
00:35:59,767 --> 00:36:01,233
IT CAN TEAR YOU UP, THOUGH,

1506
00:36:01,233 --> 00:36:03,700
IF YOU DON'T DEAL WITH IT.

1507
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,467
>> WE ARE REMAINING ABSTINENT.

1508
00:36:05,467 --> 00:36:08,567
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE

1509
00:36:08,567 --> 00:36:09,933
FOR YOU TO LAY IN BED

1510
00:36:09,933 --> 00:36:12,067
WITH ME WITHOUT DOING ANYTHING.

1511
00:36:12,067 --> 00:36:13,100
>> EVERY MAN HAS A BREAKING

1512
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:13,800
POINT.

1513
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,533
IT'S BEEN

1514
00:36:14,533 --> 00:36:15,933
HOW LONG NOW WITHOUT SEX?

1515
00:36:15,933 --> 00:36:16,933
>> YOU'RE PISSING ME OFF,

1516
00:36:16,933 --> 00:36:20,400
SCOTT, STOP.

1517
00:36:22,267 --> 00:36:23,633
>> WELL COURTNEY, HOW MUCH

1518
00:36:23,633 --> 00:36:24,667
DO YOU REGRET NOT REMAINING

1519
00:36:24,667 --> 00:36:25,867
ABSTINENT?

1520
00:36:25,867 --> 00:36:27,567
>> I LOVE MY SON SO MUCH,

1521
00:36:27,567 --> 00:36:28,800
I DON'T REGRET IT.

1522
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,433
OBVIOUSLY I'M NOT A TEENAGER

1523
00:36:30,433 --> 00:36:31,200
ANYMORE,

1524
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:32,100
I'M A PARENT,

1525
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,067
BUT I LOVE MY SON.

1526
00:36:33,067 --> 00:36:34,767
>> WHAT HAVE YOU GIVEN UP?

1527
00:36:34,767 --> 00:36:36,267
>> EVERYTHING. I'M A MOM NOW.

1528
00:36:36,267 --> 00:36:37,267
I NEVER GOT TO LIVE

1529
00:36:37,267 --> 00:36:38,700
MY TEENAGER YEARS.

1530
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:39,933
I'M A MOM NOW,

1531
00:36:39,933 --> 00:36:41,367
BUT I DON'T REGRET ANYTHING.

1532
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:42,267
>> IF YOU WERE TALKING

1533
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:43,600
TO ANOTHER 16-YEAR-OLD,

1534
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:45,200
WOULD YOU DISCOURAGE HER?

1535
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,433
>> OH, I DEFINITELY WOULD TELL

1536
00:36:46,433 --> 00:36:47,433
HER TO USE PROTECTION,

1537
00:36:47,433 --> 00:36:48,833
OR IF SHE WANTS TO, IF SHE CAN

1538
00:36:48,833 --> 00:36:49,700
OR IF SHE WANTS TO ENOUGH,

1539
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,700
TO GO ABSTINENT.

1540
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,500
BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIVE

1541
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:53,367
YOUR TEENAGE YEARS.

1542
00:36:53,367 --> 00:36:54,433
YOU'RE A PARENT.

1543
00:36:54,433 --> 00:36:56,933
I MEAN, I MISSED MY PROM,

1544
00:36:56,933 --> 00:37:00,400
I MISSED WALKING WITH MY CLASS

1545
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,967
AND HANGING OUT WITH MY FRIENDS.

1546
00:37:01,967 --> 00:37:03,367
WE JUST STAY AT HOME.

1547
00:37:03,367 --> 00:37:04,200
>> WHY DIDN'T YOU USE

1548
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:06,267
PROTECTION?

1549
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:07,633
>> WELL, I WAS TAKING THE PILL,

1550
00:37:07,633 --> 00:37:09,233
AND I WAS REALLY IRRESPONSIBLE

1551
00:37:09,233 --> 00:37:09,933
WITH THE PILL,

1552
00:37:09,933 --> 00:37:12,367
AND I DIDN'T TAKE IT THE NIGHT

1553
00:37:12,367 --> 00:37:13,300
THAT WE--

1554
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:15,467
>> WOW. ONE NIGHT.

1555
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:17,067
>> WELL, ACTUALLY IT WAS A FEW

1556
00:37:17,067 --> 00:37:22,067
NIGHTS AND WE DID USE CONDOMS,

1557
00:37:22,067 --> 00:37:23,300
BUT THAT NIGHT IT WAS SPUR

1558
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,400
OF THE MOMENT, SO...

1559
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:26,367
>> YOU HAD BEEN USING CONDOMS.

1560
00:37:26,367 --> 00:37:27,467
SO YOU GUYS HAD BEEN HAVING SEX

1561
00:37:27,467 --> 00:37:28,167
FOR A WHILE

1562
00:37:28,167 --> 00:37:29,267
BEFORE YOU GOT PREGNANT.

1563
00:37:29,267 --> 00:37:30,200
>> YEAH.

1564
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,267
>> AND SCOTT, HOW DO YOU FEEL

1565
00:37:31,267 --> 00:37:31,933
ABOUT HER DECISION

1566
00:37:31,933 --> 00:37:35,167
TO RETURN TO ABSTINENCE.

1567
00:37:35,167 --> 00:37:35,867
>> YOU KNOW,

1568
00:37:35,867 --> 00:37:37,433
I TAKE IT LIKE EVERY GUY DOES.

1569
00:37:37,433 --> 00:37:38,633
I DON'T LIKE IT,

1570
00:37:38,633 --> 00:37:41,967
BUT I LIKE HER, SO...

1571
00:37:41,967 --> 00:37:42,633
>> OH.

1572
00:37:42,633 --> 00:37:44,333
>> ARE YOU TRYING TO TEST HIM?

1573
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:45,933
>> NO, I'M DOING

1574
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:47,100
IT MORE FOR MYSELF,

1575
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:48,667
BUT IT IS TESTING HIM

1576
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:49,400
SO IT'S GOOD

1577
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,267
TO SEE THAT HE'S GONNA STICK

1578
00:37:50,267 --> 00:37:51,067
WITH ME THROUGH ANYTHING.

1579
00:37:51,067 --> 00:37:51,700
>> AND IT SEEMS

1580
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:52,600
LIKE THERE WAS A LOT OF TENSION

1581
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,100
ABOUT WORK AND RESOURCES.

1582
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:55,767
YOU FELT LIKE YOU

1583
00:37:55,767 --> 00:37:57,433
WERE BEING EXPLOITED ALMOST,

1584
00:37:57,433 --> 00:37:59,067
I HEARD YOU SAY.

1585
00:37:59,067 --> 00:38:02,733
>> AH, NO, JUST THE WHOLE,

1586
00:38:02,733 --> 00:38:03,700
"I EXPECT YOU TO PAY FOR

1587
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:04,667
EVERYTHING AND DO EVERYTHING,

1588
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:05,933
BUT ALSO RIGHT

1589
00:38:05,933 --> 00:38:06,800
WHEN YOU GET OFF WORK,

1590
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:09,133
COME AND DO EVERYTHING HERE."

1591
00:38:09,133 --> 00:38:13,067
BUT WE MET IN MUTUAL GROUND.

1592
00:38:13,067 --> 00:38:13,967
NOW WE'RE GOOD.

1593
00:38:13,967 --> 00:38:15,500
NOW WE JUST STRESS ABOUT MONEY.

1594
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:16,467
MOST OF THOSE FIGHTS

1595
00:38:16,467 --> 00:38:18,067
WERE JUST REPETITIVE AND STUPID

1596
00:38:18,067 --> 00:38:19,300
BECAUSE MONEY.

1597
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,833
ONCE YOU HAVE A BABY YOU THINK

1598
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:22,967
ALL YOU NEED IS A $5 PACK

1599
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:24,967
OF DIAPERS AND $2 WIPES.

1600
00:38:24,967 --> 00:38:27,200
WELL, THAT LASTS YOU TWO DAYS.

1601
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,767
THERE'S ALSO CLOTHES,

1602
00:38:28,767 --> 00:38:30,400
THERE'S BIBS, THERE'S FOOD.

1603
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:31,433
THE OLDER THEY GET,

1604
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:32,767
THE MORE EXPENSIVE THEY GET.

1605
00:38:32,767 --> 00:38:35,633
SOON COMES SHOES AND SCHOOL,

1606
00:38:35,633 --> 00:38:40,200
AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF STRESS.

1607
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:40,867
>> COURTNEY, TELL ME

1608
00:38:40,867 --> 00:38:42,567
ABOUT YOUR PLANS

1609
00:38:42,567 --> 00:38:44,967
FOR THE SURGERY FOR YOUR SON.

1610
00:38:44,967 --> 00:38:46,567
>> HIS SURGERY IS SCHEDULED

1611
00:38:46,567 --> 00:38:48,400
IN AUGUST.

1612
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,967
>> AND DEAN HAS A VERY SLIGHT

1613
00:38:50,967 --> 00:38:51,633
DEFECT.

1614
00:38:51,633 --> 00:38:52,400
>> YES. VERY MINOR.

1615
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,200
WE WERE BLESSED.

1616
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,267
>> THE SPECIALIST SAID

1617
00:38:55,267 --> 00:38:57,800
IT WAS THE MOST MINOR ONE

1618
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:59,067
SHE'S EVER SEEN.

1619
00:38:59,067 --> 00:39:00,300
>> HOW ABOUT THE COST OF THAT?

1620
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,400
I KNOW THAT STRESSES SCOTT OUT.

1621
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,500
>> WE HAVEN'T FOUND OUT YET.

1622
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:03,667
>> THEY'RE GONNA QUOTE US,

1623
00:39:03,667 --> 00:39:04,367
YOU KNOW,

1624
00:39:04,367 --> 00:39:05,067
AND THEN SEND IT

1625
00:39:05,067 --> 00:39:05,767
TO THE INSURANCE.

1626
00:39:05,767 --> 00:39:06,733
INSURANCE WILL SAY THIS IS ABOUT

1627
00:39:06,733 --> 00:39:07,567
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA GET PAID.

1628
00:39:07,567 --> 00:39:08,600
>> SO YOU'RE WAITING TO SEE WHAT

1629
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:09,533
THE INSURANCE IS GOING TO COVER.

1630
00:39:09,533 --> 00:39:10,233
>> AND IT IS CONSIDERED

1631
00:39:10,233 --> 00:39:11,300
A COSMETIC SURGERY, SO--

1632
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:12,500
>> IT IS?

1633
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,533
>> IT'S RIDICULOUS, I KNOW.

1634
00:39:13,533 --> 00:39:15,100
>> YEAH, THEY CHANGED IT,

1635
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,167
BECAUSE I THINK HER DAD WAS

1636
00:39:16,167 --> 00:39:20,333
SAYING THAT IT WAS NECESSARY,

1637
00:39:20,333 --> 00:39:21,933
NOW THEY SAY IT'S COSMETIC.

1638
00:39:21,933 --> 00:39:23,733
I THINK IT'S JUST INSURANCE

1639
00:39:23,733 --> 00:39:24,433
NOT WANTING TO PAY.

1640
00:39:24,433 --> 00:39:25,200
>> YEAH, I THINK THAT'S

1641
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,067
WHY WE HAVE TO PAY SOME.

1642
00:39:28,067 --> 00:39:29,067
>> I DON'T THINK PEOPLE

1643
00:39:29,067 --> 00:39:30,933
UNDERSTAND WHAT A CLEFT LIP IS,

1644
00:39:30,933 --> 00:39:32,067
AND YOU SEEM INTERESTED TO SORT

1645
00:39:32,067 --> 00:39:33,300
OF EDUCATE PEOPLE ABOUT THAT.

1646
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:33,967
DO YOU WANT TO TALK

1647
00:39:33,967 --> 00:39:35,100
ABOUT THE DEFECT YOU HAD?

1648
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,367
>> MY PALATE WAS WAY WORSE

1649
00:39:36,367 --> 00:39:37,267
THAN MY LIP.

1650
00:39:37,267 --> 00:39:39,467
I DID HAVE A BILATERAL.

1651
00:39:39,467 --> 00:39:40,367
>> YOU HAD AN OPEN LIP

1652
00:39:40,367 --> 00:39:41,133
ON BOTH SIDES.

1653
00:39:41,133 --> 00:39:42,567
>> WELL, ONE WENT ALL THE WAY

1654
00:39:42,567 --> 00:39:43,433
THROUGHOUT MY NOSE

1655
00:39:43,433 --> 00:39:44,500
AND THE OTHER ONE

1656
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,500
WAS HALFWAY, SO--

1657
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:47,833
AND THEN IT WENT

1658
00:39:47,833 --> 00:39:49,067
THROUGH MY PALATE ON TOP

1659
00:39:49,067 --> 00:39:50,533
AND I HAD, LIKE, NO PALATE.

1660
00:39:50,533 --> 00:39:51,533
>> I IMAGINE YOU GOT USED

1661
00:39:51,533 --> 00:39:54,100
TO PEOPLE LOOKING AT THAT

1662
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,700
AND FREAKING OUT ABOUT THAT.

1663
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,400
>> YEAH.

1664
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,133
IT ONLY MADE ME STRONGER,

1665
00:39:57,133 --> 00:39:57,833
THOUGH.

1666
00:39:57,833 --> 00:39:58,867
NOBODY REALLY CAME UP TO ME

1667
00:39:58,867 --> 00:39:59,600
AND MADE FUN OF ME.

1668
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:00,967
THAT ONLY HAPPENED A FEW TIMES.

1669
00:40:00,967 --> 00:40:02,133
>> THEY MADE FUN OF YOU?

1670
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:02,900
>> YEAH.

1671
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,033
>> LIKE OTHER KIDS?

1672
00:40:04,033 --> 00:40:05,133
>> YEAH.

1673
00:40:05,133 --> 00:40:07,300
>> WAS THAT AFTER SURGERIES?

1674
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:07,967
>> A LITTLE,

1675
00:40:07,967 --> 00:40:09,333
BUT NOT AFTER ALL MY SURGERIES.

1676
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:10,033
>> HOW MANY SURGERIES

1677
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:10,700
DID YOU HAVE?

1678
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:11,400
>> SEVEN.

1679
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:12,067
>> SEVEN SURGERIES.

1680
00:40:12,067 --> 00:40:12,800
AND HOW OLD WERE THEY

1681
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,133
WHEN THEY STARTED?

1682
00:40:14,133 --> 00:40:15,100
>> THREE MONTHS.

1683
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,167
>> INCLUDING JAW SURGERY.

1684
00:40:16,167 --> 00:40:17,367
THEY HAD TO BREAK HER JAW

1685
00:40:17,367 --> 00:40:18,100
AND PUT IT BACK IN PLACE.

1686
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:18,833
>> THEY HAD TO DO A LOT

1687
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,600
OF RECONSTRUCTION ON YOU.

1688
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:21,467
>> AND EDUCATIONALLY

1689
00:40:21,467 --> 00:40:22,667
WHAT'S THE PLAN GOING FORWARD?

1690
00:40:22,667 --> 00:40:23,733
>> I JUST GRADUATED

1691
00:40:23,733 --> 00:40:25,433
LAST WEDNESDAY.

1692
00:40:25,433 --> 00:40:26,167
>> CONGRATULATIONS.

1693
00:40:26,167 --> 00:40:28,033
>> THANK YOU.

1694
00:40:28,033 --> 00:40:30,233
[applause]

1695
00:40:30,233 --> 00:40:31,433
>> OKAY, WELL, THANK YOU, GUYS.

1696
00:40:31,433 --> 00:40:32,333
TODAY WE HAVE TALKED

1697
00:40:32,333 --> 00:40:33,900
A LOT ABOUT PREVENTION.

1698
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,300
TO LEARN THE FACTS,

1699
00:40:35,300 --> 00:40:36,100
BE SURE AND CHECK OUT

1700
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:38,500
16ANDPREGNANT.MTV.COM.

1701
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,600
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

1702
00:40:45,333 --> 00:40:46,567
>> I WASN'T ON BIRTH CONTROL

1703
00:40:46,567 --> 00:40:47,267
BECAUSE...

1704
00:40:47,267 --> 00:40:48,300
>> I JUST DIDN'T THINK ABOUT IT.

1705
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,067
>> BECAUSE I WAS SCARED

1706
00:40:49,067 --> 00:40:50,067
TO TALK ABOUT THAT KIND OF THING

1707
00:40:50,067 --> 00:40:51,933
WITH MY MOM.

1708
00:40:51,933 --> 00:40:52,767
>> I WAS AFRAID OF GAINING

1709
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:53,567
WEIGHT.

1710
00:40:53,567 --> 00:40:54,533
>> IT'S HARD TO HAVE A BABY

1711
00:40:54,533 --> 00:40:55,200
AS A TEENAGER.

1712
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:55,900
>> GUESS WHAT?

1713
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,900
YOU WANT TO GO OUT, TOO BAD.

1714
00:40:56,900 --> 00:40:58,000
YOU WANT TO GO WORK

1715
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:58,667
AND MAKE MONEY,

1716
00:40:58,667 --> 00:40:59,833
YOU'RE MAKING ALL THAT MONEY

1717
00:40:59,833 --> 00:41:01,267
TO WRAP YOUR KID'S ASS.

1718
00:41:01,267 --> 00:41:02,100
>> I JUST RECENTLY

1719
00:41:02,100 --> 00:41:03,067
GOT BACK ON BIRTH CONTROL.

1720
00:41:03,067 --> 00:41:03,733
>> IT'S LIKE A WEIGHT

1721
00:41:03,733 --> 00:41:04,700
LIFTED OFF MY SHOULDERS.

1722
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:05,433
>> IT WAS REALLY EASY

1723
00:41:05,433 --> 00:41:06,467
TO ASK FOR IT.

1724
00:41:06,467 --> 00:41:07,267
>> SO IT'S BETTER TO JUST

1725
00:41:07,267 --> 00:41:09,567
PREVENT IT IN THE FIRST PLACE.

1726
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,200
>> MILLINA HAD TWO PROBLEMATIC

1727
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,933
MOTHERS DURING HER PREGNANCY.

1728
00:41:18,933 --> 00:41:20,500
ONE WAS HER OWN MOM

1729
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:22,233
WHO WAS INCARCERATED.

1730
00:41:22,233 --> 00:41:23,700
SHE CONTINUALLY THEN ALSO

1731
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,600
BUTTED HEADS WITH TREVOR'S MOM.

1732
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,500
HERE'S A RECAP

1733
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:30,067
OF THAT EXPERIENCE.

1734
00:41:30,067 --> 00:41:31,333
>> I WAS TOTALLY AGAINST GETTING

1735
00:41:31,333 --> 00:41:32,100
ON BIRTH CONTROL.

1736
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,800
NOW I THINK OF ALL OF THE THINGS

1737
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,600
I COULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY.

1738
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,067
WITH MY MOM BEING IN JAIL,

1739
00:41:38,067 --> 00:41:38,767
IT'S REALLY HARD

1740
00:41:38,767 --> 00:41:40,233
FOR ME TO FOCUS.

1741
00:41:40,233 --> 00:41:41,100
IT'S HARD

1742
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,600
TO GO FROM THAT TO THIS.

1743
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:44,733
WITH TREVOR'S MOM,

1744
00:41:44,733 --> 00:41:46,367
I DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE.

1745
00:41:46,367 --> 00:41:47,700
>> THERE'S NOBODY IN THIS WORLD

1746
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:48,433
THAT WOULDN'T TRUST ME

1747
00:41:48,433 --> 00:41:49,467
WITH THEIR BABY,

1748
00:41:49,467 --> 00:41:50,233
I'LL TELL YOU

1749
00:41:50,233 --> 00:41:51,367
THAT RIGHT [bleep] NOW.

1750
00:41:51,367 --> 00:41:53,400
>> I TRIED TO TALK TO YOU.

1751
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:54,900
>> I THINK WE JUST

1752
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:55,867
NEED TO TAKE A STEP BACK

1753
00:41:55,867 --> 00:41:57,100
AND FOCUS ON THIS LITTLE GUY.

1754
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,067
>> DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE GONNA

1755
00:41:58,067 --> 00:41:58,867
BE HERE MORE FOR HIM?

1756
00:41:58,867 --> 00:42:00,567
>> I'M GONNA

1757
00:42:00,567 --> 00:42:03,600
COME AROUND AS MUCH AS I CAN.

1758
00:42:05,833 --> 00:42:07,367
>> ALL RIGHT, MILLINA, AFTER ALL

1759
00:42:07,367 --> 00:42:10,267
THAT, YOUR MOM LEFT REHAB EARLY?

1760
00:42:10,267 --> 00:42:14,267
>> YES, AND HER BOYFRIEND PASSED

1761
00:42:14,267 --> 00:42:17,733
ON HER BIRTHDAY LAST WEEK,

1762
00:42:17,733 --> 00:42:21,067
AND SHE MET HIM IN REHAB.

1763
00:42:21,067 --> 00:42:22,300
>> IN REHAB THIS TIME?

1764
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,067
>> YES.

1765
00:42:23,067 --> 00:42:24,800
>> WELL THAT'S B.S.

1766
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,833
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED

1767
00:42:25,833 --> 00:42:27,133
TO GET A BOYFRIEND IN TREATMENT.

1768
00:42:27,133 --> 00:42:27,800
>> YES.

1769
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:28,633
>> THAT'S AGAINST THE RULES.

1770
00:42:28,633 --> 00:42:29,333
>> YES, IT IS.

1771
00:42:29,333 --> 00:42:30,200
>> OKAY, SO SHE BROKE

1772
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,867
THE CARDINAL RULE NUMBER ONE,

1773
00:42:31,867 --> 00:42:33,100
AND THEN USED THAT AS A REASON

1774
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:33,900
TO LEAVE TREATMENT EARLY.

1775
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:34,833
THIS IS NOT YOUR PROBLEM,

1776
00:42:34,833 --> 00:42:35,633
IT'S HERS.

1777
00:42:35,633 --> 00:42:37,933
I MEAN COME ON, NOW.

1778
00:42:37,933 --> 00:42:38,700
HOW DO YOU FEEL

1779
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,800
ABOUT IT, MILLINA?

1780
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,900
>> I'M CONFLICTED.

1781
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:41,967
I AM.

1782
00:42:41,967 --> 00:42:44,933
I'M SO SCARED

1783
00:42:44,933 --> 00:42:47,233
THAT SHE IS GONNA RELAPSE.

1784
00:42:47,233 --> 00:42:48,733
DEATHLY AFRAID OF IT.

1785
00:42:48,733 --> 00:42:49,867
>> HOW IS YOUR MOM DOING NOW?

1786
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:51,567
>> SHE IS WONDERFUL.

1787
00:42:51,567 --> 00:42:52,233
>> IS SHE GOING

1788
00:42:52,233 --> 00:42:52,933
TO MEETINGS EVERY DAY?

1789
00:42:52,933 --> 00:42:53,667
>> YES, NOT EVERY DAY,

1790
00:42:53,667 --> 00:42:54,967
BUT SHE DOES GO TO MEETINGS.

1791
00:42:54,967 --> 00:42:55,800
>> OKAY, SHE'S LIVING UP

1792
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:56,800
TO HER END OF THE BARGAIN

1793
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:57,467
AT THE MOMENT.

1794
00:42:57,467 --> 00:42:58,167
>> YES.

1795
00:42:58,167 --> 00:43:01,533
>> HOW ABOUT TREVOR'S MOM?

1796
00:43:01,533 --> 00:43:02,800
HOW'S SHE DOING?

1797
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,467
>> SHE'S DOING A LOT BETTER.

1798
00:43:04,467 --> 00:43:05,400
>> YOU TOLD ME OFF THE AIR

1799
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,100
THAT SHE HAD A COMPLICATION

1800
00:43:07,100 --> 00:43:07,900
THAT'S CALLED

1801
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,433
A CAVERNOUS SINUS THROMBOSIS.

1802
00:43:09,433 --> 00:43:10,300
THERE ARE BIG VEINS

1803
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,467
IN YOUR SKULL

1804
00:43:11,467 --> 00:43:13,067
THAT DRAIN CEREBROSPINAL FLUID

1805
00:43:13,067 --> 00:43:14,633
AND THEY CAN GET CLOTS IN THEM.

1806
00:43:14,633 --> 00:43:16,133
IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF DANGEROUS,

1807
00:43:16,133 --> 00:43:17,400
AND NOW SHE'S ON BLOOD THINNERS?

1808
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,633
>> YEAH. SHE'S ON COUMADIN.

1809
00:43:18,633 --> 00:43:20,567
>> AND SEIZURE MEDICINE?

1810
00:43:20,567 --> 00:43:21,233
>> I DON'T KNOW.

1811
00:43:21,233 --> 00:43:23,267
SHE'S TAKING SO MANY MEDICATIONS

1812
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,367
THAT THE DOCTORS GIVE HER.

1813
00:43:24,367 --> 00:43:25,267
>> FOR HER HEAD INJURY?

1814
00:43:25,267 --> 00:43:25,933
>> YEP.

1815
00:43:25,933 --> 00:43:26,633
>> I ACTUALLY HELP HER

1816
00:43:26,633 --> 00:43:27,700
SORT HER MEDICATIONS.

1817
00:43:27,700 --> 00:43:30,233
SHE HAS A GOOD SEVEN PILLS

1818
00:43:30,233 --> 00:43:30,900
THAT SHE HAS,

1819
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:31,667
MORE THAN SEVEN PILLS

1820
00:43:31,667 --> 00:43:32,533
THAT SHE HAS TO TAKE EVERY DAY.

1821
00:43:32,533 --> 00:43:33,333
>> BUT SHE'S NOT ABUSING

1822
00:43:33,333 --> 00:43:34,067
MEDICATION.

1823
00:43:34,067 --> 00:43:35,067
THESE ARE THINGS THAT--

1824
00:43:35,067 --> 00:43:35,900
>> NO, THEY ARE ALL PRESCRIBED.

1825
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:36,700
>> RIGHT.

1826
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:37,367
HOW ARE YOU GUYS

1827
00:43:37,367 --> 00:43:38,200
GETTING ALONG NOW?

1828
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:39,333
>> CURRENTLY WE ARE GETTING

1829
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:40,833
ALONG VERY WELL,

1830
00:43:40,833 --> 00:43:42,067
BECAUSE I REALLY AM TRYING.

1831
00:43:42,067 --> 00:43:44,200
I DON'T ENJOY FIGHTING WITH HER

1832
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:45,533
AND I KNOW IT UPSETS TREVOR

1833
00:43:45,533 --> 00:43:47,067
AND IT'S NOT FAIR TO KAYDEN.

1834
00:43:47,067 --> 00:43:48,200
>> DO YOU LET KAYDEN

1835
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,500
BE TAKEN CARE OF BY HER?

1836
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,500
>> IF IT'S HER AND,

1837
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:52,833
LIKE, TREVOR'S LITTLE BROTHER,

1838
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:54,433
OR HER AND SOMEBODY ELSE,

1839
00:43:54,433 --> 00:43:55,700
I'M COMPLETELY FINE WITH IT,

1840
00:43:55,700 --> 00:43:56,833
BUT JUST HER

1841
00:43:56,833 --> 00:43:58,367
AND THE BABY, I DON'T--

1842
00:43:58,367 --> 00:43:59,067
>> AND WILL SHE

1843
00:43:59,067 --> 00:43:59,800
ADMIT IT HERSELF,

1844
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,067
SHE WEARS OUT PRETTY EASILY?

1845
00:44:01,067 --> 00:44:01,733
>> I DON'T THINK

1846
00:44:01,733 --> 00:44:03,433
SHE WANTS TO ADMIT IT.

1847
00:44:03,433 --> 00:44:04,733
>> TREVOR, SHOULD MILLINA

1848
00:44:04,733 --> 00:44:07,167
TRUST YOUR MOM WITH THE BABY?

1849
00:44:07,167 --> 00:44:08,567
>> IN TIME.

1850
00:44:08,567 --> 00:44:09,233
>> IN TIME.

1851
00:44:09,233 --> 00:44:10,633
>> IN TIME.

1852
00:44:10,633 --> 00:44:12,433
>> AND HOW ARE YOU GUYS

1853
00:44:12,433 --> 00:44:13,533
DOING AT YOUR RELATIONSHIP?

1854
00:44:13,533 --> 00:44:14,700
WHAT'S GOING ON THERE?

1855
00:44:14,700 --> 00:44:15,767
>> IT WAS WEIRD.

1856
00:44:15,767 --> 00:44:16,500
WITH THE WHOLE

1857
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:17,567
CO-PARENTING THING

1858
00:44:17,567 --> 00:44:19,167
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN

1859
00:44:19,167 --> 00:44:20,333
ON AND OFF FOR WHAT?

1860
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:21,067
TWO YEARS NOW?

1861
00:44:21,067 --> 00:44:22,533
>> YEAH.

1862
00:44:22,533 --> 00:44:24,533
>> AND TO JUST, LIKE, STOP

1863
00:44:24,533 --> 00:44:26,400
AND KIND OF BE FRIENDS--

1864
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,133
>> IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

1865
00:44:27,133 --> 00:44:29,067
>> YEAH, IT IS. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

1866
00:44:29,067 --> 00:44:32,133
BUT WE DON'T WANT

1867
00:44:32,133 --> 00:44:33,700
TO JUST JUMP INTO IT AGAIN

1868
00:44:33,700 --> 00:44:35,533
AND JUST, YOU KNOW,

1869
00:44:35,533 --> 00:44:36,733
LET IT FALL APART AGAIN

1870
00:44:36,733 --> 00:44:37,800
AND THEN JUMP BACK INTO IT.

1871
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,067
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF WE

1872
00:44:40,067 --> 00:44:40,867
GET BACK TOGETHER AGAIN,

1873
00:44:40,867 --> 00:44:41,733
WE'RE SETTLING DOWN.

1874
00:44:41,733 --> 00:44:42,500
>> YEAH.

1875
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:44,333
>> YOU GUYS WERE BROKEN UP.

1876
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:45,067
>> YES.

1877
00:44:45,067 --> 00:44:45,667
>> DID YOU GET

1878
00:44:45,667 --> 00:44:46,433
INVOLVED WITH ANYBODY ELSE

1879
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:47,133
WHEN YOU WERE BROKEN UP?

1880
00:44:47,133 --> 00:44:48,300
>> WE BOTH DID.

1881
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:48,967
>> ARE YOU WITH ANY

1882
00:44:48,967 --> 00:44:50,067
OF THOSE PEOPLE NOW?

1883
00:44:50,067 --> 00:44:50,900
>> NO, IT WAS A ONE NIGHT

1884
00:44:50,900 --> 00:44:51,633
STAND TYPE THING.

1885
00:44:51,633 --> 00:44:52,300
>> FOR YOU TOO?

1886
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:53,200
>> YES.

1887
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:53,967
>> YOU HAD A ONE NIGHT STAND

1888
00:44:53,967 --> 00:44:54,833
AND YOU HAD A ONE NIGHT STAND?

1889
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:55,700
>> MINE WAS A LONGER

1890
00:44:55,700 --> 00:44:56,567
THAN ONE NIGHT STAND.

1891
00:44:56,567 --> 00:44:58,967
>> HOW LONG?

1892
00:44:58,967 --> 00:44:59,733
>> ABOUT A MONTH AND A HALF.

1893
00:44:59,733 --> 00:45:00,433
>> OH,

1894
00:45:00,433 --> 00:45:01,267
THAT'S QUITE A LONG NIGHT.

1895
00:45:01,267 --> 00:45:01,933
>> IT IS. IT IS.

1896
00:45:01,933 --> 00:45:03,233
>> SIX WEEKS.

1897
00:45:03,233 --> 00:45:04,133
AND TREVOR,

1898
00:45:04,133 --> 00:45:06,133
THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU HAPPY.

1899
00:45:06,133 --> 00:45:07,733
>> NO, BUT I CAN UNDERSTAND

1900
00:45:07,733 --> 00:45:09,067
HOW SHE FEELS.

1901
00:45:09,067 --> 00:45:10,200
>> ARE YOU IN A RELATIONSHIP

1902
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,667
NOW?

1903
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,067
>> PRETTY MUCH.

1904
00:45:13,067 --> 00:45:13,767
IT'S COMPLICATED.

1905
00:45:13,767 --> 00:45:16,333
>> ARE YOU HOOKING UP STILL?

1906
00:45:16,333 --> 00:45:17,067
WHAT ARE YOU USING

1907
00:45:17,067 --> 00:45:18,067
FOR BIRTH CONTROL?

1908
00:45:18,067 --> 00:45:19,233
>> OH, I'M ON IMPLANON.

1909
00:45:19,233 --> 00:45:20,167
I HAVE IT IN MY ARM RIGHT HERE.

1910
00:45:20,167 --> 00:45:20,833
>> GREAT.

1911
00:45:20,833 --> 00:45:21,800
>> IT LASTS FOR THREE YEARS.

1912
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:23,233
>> FANTASTIC. GOOD.

1913
00:45:23,233 --> 00:45:24,367
YOU GLAD YOU DID THAT?

1914
00:45:24,367 --> 00:45:25,067
>> YES.

1915
00:45:25,067 --> 00:45:26,933
BECAUSE AS MUCH AS I

1916
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:28,267
LOVE MY SON,

1917
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:32,833
I AM NOT CAPABLE

1918
00:45:32,833 --> 00:45:34,267
OF RAISING ANOTHER CHILD.

1919
00:45:34,267 --> 00:45:35,133
I'M HARDLY CAPABLE

1920
00:45:35,133 --> 00:45:37,433
OF RAISING OUR ONE.

1921
00:45:37,433 --> 00:45:39,600
AND THE NEXT BABY I HAVE,

1922
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,633
I WANT TO BE MARRIED

1923
00:45:42,633 --> 00:45:43,933
AND I WANT TO BE WITH THE GUY

1924
00:45:43,933 --> 00:45:45,067
THAT I'M GONNA BE WITH FOREVER,

1925
00:45:45,067 --> 00:45:46,400
AND I WANT TO HAVE MY OWN HOUSE

1926
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:47,100
AND I WANT TO BE ABLE

1927
00:45:47,100 --> 00:45:47,933
TO SUPPORT THEM,

1928
00:45:47,933 --> 00:45:48,700
NOT LIVING

1929
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:49,533
UNDER MY GRANDMA'S ROOF,

1930
00:45:49,533 --> 00:45:50,633
NOT HAVING SOMEBODY ELSE PAY

1931
00:45:50,633 --> 00:45:51,333
BY BILLS.

1932
00:45:51,333 --> 00:45:52,067
>> DO YOU HOPE

1933
00:45:52,067 --> 00:45:52,967
THAT WOULD BE TREVOR?

1934
00:45:52,967 --> 00:45:54,400
>> I DO.

1935
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:55,900
I DO.

1936
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,133
>> OKAY, WELL, TREVOR,

1937
00:45:57,133 --> 00:46:00,467
WE'LL BE CHECKING BACK IN TO SEE

1938
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:02,267
WHEN YOU FOLLOW THROUGH ON THAT.

1939
00:46:02,267 --> 00:46:03,300
I'LL CHECK IN ON YOU.

1940
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:04,533
AND WHEN WE RETURN,

1941
00:46:04,533 --> 00:46:06,400
WE HAVE A SHOCKING REVELATION

1942
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:07,700
ABOUT MADDY'S BOYFRIEND

1943
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:09,400
THAT YOU DO NOT WANT TO MISS.

1944
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:12,300
STAY WITH US.

1945
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:25,500
>> AND WELCOME BACK.

1946
00:46:25,500 --> 00:46:26,333
NOW, NINE MONTHS

1947
00:46:26,333 --> 00:46:27,233
AFTER GIVING BIRTH,

1948
00:46:27,233 --> 00:46:29,267
LESS THAN HALF OF TEEN MOMS

1949
00:46:29,267 --> 00:46:30,067
ARE LIVING

1950
00:46:30,067 --> 00:46:31,633
WITH THE BIOLOGICAL FATHER.

1951
00:46:31,633 --> 00:46:33,167
THAT NUMBER INCLUDES MADDY,

1952
00:46:33,167 --> 00:46:34,900
WHO HAS NOT EVEN SPOKEN TO CODY

1953
00:46:34,900 --> 00:46:35,600
SINCE THEY STOPPED

1954
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:36,833
FILMING THEIR EPISODE,

1955
00:46:36,833 --> 00:46:38,467
SO AS WE BRING THEM TOGETHER HER

1956
00:46:38,467 --> 00:46:39,200
FOR THE FIRST TIME

1957
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:40,533
IN OUR STUDIO, LET'S FIRST

1958
00:46:40,533 --> 00:46:44,567
TAKE A LOOK AT THEIR STORY.

1959
00:46:44,567 --> 00:46:45,233
>> I SLEEP WITH CODY

1960
00:46:45,233 --> 00:46:47,467
ONE TIME AND THIS HAPPENED.

1961
00:46:47,467 --> 00:46:48,867
I BARELY KNOW HIM AND I'M GONNA

1962
00:46:48,867 --> 00:46:49,667
RAISE A BABY WITH HIM?

1963
00:46:49,667 --> 00:46:50,833
>> I DID NOT EXPECT

1964
00:46:50,833 --> 00:46:51,700
TO BE PREGNANT

1965
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:53,967
BEFORE WENT ON A SINGLE DATE.

1966
00:46:53,967 --> 00:46:54,633
>> I JUST THINK

1967
00:46:54,633 --> 00:46:55,433
YOU'RE TOO YOUNG FOR THIS.

1968
00:46:55,433 --> 00:46:57,300
I THINK YOUR WHOLE LIFE IS DONE.

1969
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,400
>> I DIDN'T CHOOSE TO GET

1970
00:46:58,400 --> 00:46:59,667
PREGNANT AT THIS AGE, MOM.

1971
00:46:59,667 --> 00:47:01,167
I DIDN'T PLAN IT.

1972
00:47:01,167 --> 00:47:02,333
>> I TOLD YOU FROM DAY ONE

1973
00:47:02,333 --> 00:47:03,367
THAT I WOULD ALWAYS KICK YOU OUT

1974
00:47:03,367 --> 00:47:05,867
IF YOU EVER GOT PREGNANT AT 16.

1975
00:47:05,867 --> 00:47:08,800
>> WELL, LET'S SEE HOW IT GOES.

1976
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,267
MADDY TEXTED ME, AND SAID

1977
00:47:11,267 --> 00:47:12,933
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO LIVE HERE.

1978
00:47:12,933 --> 00:47:13,800
>> I FEEL LIKE SINCE WE

1979
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:14,933
HAVE A KID, EVERYONE

1980
00:47:14,933 --> 00:47:16,467
THINKS WE HAVE TO BE TOGETHER.

1981
00:47:16,467 --> 00:47:19,733
>> YEAH.

1982
00:47:21,667 --> 00:47:22,967
>> WELL, I GUESS YOU GUYS

1983
00:47:22,967 --> 00:47:23,867
HAVE NOT REMAINED TOGETHER,

1984
00:47:23,867 --> 00:47:24,533
RIGHT?

1985
00:47:24,533 --> 00:47:25,267
>> NO.

1986
00:47:25,267 --> 00:47:26,433
>> AND HOW ARE THINGS NOW.

1987
00:47:26,433 --> 00:47:27,333
>> I HAVE NOT EVEN SEEN HIM

1988
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:28,700
OR TALKED TO HIM SINCE DECEMBER.

1989
00:47:28,700 --> 00:47:30,400
>> HOW COME?

1990
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:31,100
>> HE DOESN'T WANT

1991
00:47:31,100 --> 00:47:32,567
TO BE A FATHER, I GUESS.

1992
00:47:32,567 --> 00:47:33,400
>> CODY?

1993
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:34,633
>> NO, BECAUSE YOU GOT INSULTED

1994
00:47:34,633 --> 00:47:36,367
BECAUSE I ASKED FOR A DNA TEST.

1995
00:47:36,367 --> 00:47:37,667
YOU GOT ALL DEFENSIVE OVER IT.

1996
00:47:37,667 --> 00:47:39,100
>> OKAY, IF YOU WANT A DNA TEST

1997
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:39,800
SO BAD, WHY WOULD YOU

1998
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:41,367
SIGN THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE?

1999
00:47:41,367 --> 00:47:42,067
>> I DON'T KNOW.

2000
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:42,800
I FIGURED IT WOULDN'T BE

2001
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,467
A PROBLEM GETTING IT--

2002
00:47:43,467 --> 00:47:44,300
>> AND WHY ARE YOU COMPLAINING

2003
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:45,067
THAT SHE DOESN'T HAVE

2004
00:47:45,067 --> 00:47:45,933
YOUR LAST NAME IF YOU DON'T EVEN

2005
00:47:45,933 --> 00:47:46,700
THINK YOU'RE HER FATHER?

2006
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:47,567
THAT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE.

2007
00:47:47,567 --> 00:47:48,467
>> I DON'T SEE WHAT THE PROBLEM

2008
00:47:48,467 --> 00:47:49,733
IS IN MAKING SURE SHE IS MINE,

2009
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:50,600
THOUGH, BEFORE I TRY--

2010
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,633
>> OKAY, THEN YOU PAY FOR IT.

2011
00:47:51,633 --> 00:47:52,367
IF YOU'RE NOT PAYING

2012
00:47:52,367 --> 00:47:53,067
CHILD SUPPORT,

2013
00:47:53,067 --> 00:47:53,800
WHY SHOULD I PAY TO BE TOLD

2014
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:54,900
WHAT I ALREADY KNOW?

2015
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,533
>> YEAH. I DON'T KNOW.

2016
00:47:56,533 --> 00:47:57,233
>> YOU HAVE A JOB.

2017
00:47:57,233 --> 00:47:58,567
PAY FOR IT. I'M NOT DOING IT.

2018
00:47:58,567 --> 00:47:59,233
>> I GOT ANOTHER KID

2019
00:47:59,233 --> 00:48:00,433
TO WORRY ABOUT TOO.

2020
00:48:00,433 --> 00:48:01,867
>> CODY, YOU HAVE ANOTHER CHILD?

2021
00:48:01,867 --> 00:48:02,933
>> YEAH.

2022
00:48:02,933 --> 00:48:04,500
>> DID YOU GET THAT WOMAN

2023
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:06,733
PREGNANT AROUND THE SAME TIME?

2024
00:48:06,733 --> 00:48:07,433
LIKE, RIGHT AROUND

2025
00:48:07,433 --> 00:48:08,100
THE SAME TIME?

2026
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:08,833
>> TWO MONTHS PRIOR.

2027
00:48:08,833 --> 00:48:09,500
>> TWO MONTHS.

2028
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,067
>> TWO MONTHS.

2029
00:48:11,067 --> 00:48:13,200
SO MADDY, IT SEEMS YOUR ANGER

2030
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,367
FOR HIM IS MULTI-LAYERED,

2031
00:48:15,367 --> 00:48:16,067
RIGHT?

2032
00:48:16,067 --> 00:48:16,733
>> OH, YEAH.

2033
00:48:16,733 --> 00:48:17,500
>> SO YOU'RE ANGRY THAT

2034
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:19,367
HE'S NOT SUPPORTING THE CHILD,

2035
00:48:19,367 --> 00:48:20,167
YOU'RE NOT WILLING TO GET

2036
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:20,933
A PATERNITY TEST.

2037
00:48:20,933 --> 00:48:21,867
>> NO, I'M WILLING TO,

2038
00:48:21,867 --> 00:48:23,067
I'M JUST NOT PAYING FOR IT.

2039
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:23,800
>> OKAY.

2040
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:25,333
>> AND ARE YOU GONNA

2041
00:48:25,333 --> 00:48:27,233
HIRE AN ATTORNEY TO GET CUSTODY?

2042
00:48:27,233 --> 00:48:28,633
>> IF THAT'S, LIKE, NECESSARY,

2043
00:48:28,633 --> 00:48:30,667
AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT IS.

2044
00:48:30,667 --> 00:48:31,967
EVEN WHEN WE WERE TALKING, YOU

2045
00:48:31,967 --> 00:48:33,133
WOULDN'T LET ME BRING HER HOME.

2046
00:48:33,133 --> 00:48:34,100
YOU WOULDN'T LET ME DO NOTHING.

2047
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,233
>> SHE'S BREAST FED,

2048
00:48:35,233 --> 00:48:35,900
WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA

2049
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:36,633
FEED HER WITH YOUR BOOB?

2050
00:48:36,633 --> 00:48:37,333
>> PUMP IT, YOU PUMP IT.

2051
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:38,467
THEY MAKE THEM FOR A REASON.

2052
00:48:38,467 --> 00:48:39,700
>> SHE WON'T TAKE A BOTTLE.

2053
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,067
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO BOTTLE

2054
00:48:41,067 --> 00:48:42,400
SINCE SHE WAS A NEWBORN AND SHE

2055
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,067
WILL NOT TAKE THE BOTTLE.

2056
00:48:44,067 --> 00:48:44,733
>> WHY NOT PAY

2057
00:48:44,733 --> 00:48:45,967
FOR THE PATERNITY TEST?

2058
00:48:45,967 --> 00:48:47,400
>> IT'S $600.

2059
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:48,633
>> IT'S $130 DOLLARS.

2060
00:48:48,633 --> 00:48:50,100
>> NO, PLUS LAB FEES.

2061
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:51,367
>> AND HE STARTED--

2062
00:48:51,367 --> 00:48:52,400
>> IF IT'S JUST $130 DOLLARS

2063
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,533
WHY DON'T YOU--

2064
00:48:53,533 --> 00:48:54,667
>> BECAUSE I PAY FOR STUFF

2065
00:48:54,667 --> 00:48:55,367
FOR HER.

2066
00:48:55,367 --> 00:48:56,200
WHAT DO YOU PAY FOR, NOTHING.

2067
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,200
>> YOU DON'T GOT A JOB.

2068
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:58,267
>> YEAH.

2069
00:48:58,267 --> 00:48:58,933
>> YOUR DADDY

2070
00:48:58,933 --> 00:48:59,600
PAYS FOR EVERYTHING.

2071
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,467
>> NO, HE DOES NOT.

2072
00:49:00,467 --> 00:49:01,367
I HAD MONEY SAVED

2073
00:49:01,367 --> 00:49:02,200
BEFORE I HAD HER.

2074
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,500
MY FAMILY'S NOT EVEN RICH.

2075
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:04,167
>> OKAY.

2076
00:49:04,167 --> 00:49:05,067
>> YOU ARE LIVING WITH YOUR DAD

2077
00:49:05,067 --> 00:49:05,700
THOUGH.

2078
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:06,367
>> YES.

2079
00:49:06,367 --> 00:49:07,200
>> AND HE DOES SUPPORT YOU.

2080
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:07,867
>> HE HELPS.

2081
00:49:07,867 --> 00:49:08,867
>> I MEAN, SOMEBODY'S SUPPORTING

2082
00:49:08,867 --> 00:49:11,467
YOU; IT'S A LOT TO BE A MOM.

2083
00:49:11,467 --> 00:49:12,333
DO YOU WORK ALSO?

2084
00:49:12,333 --> 00:49:13,233
>> NO. I CAN'T.

2085
00:49:13,233 --> 00:49:14,267
I'M BREASTFEEDING, SO...

2086
00:49:14,267 --> 00:49:15,533
>> OKAY, IS THERE A PLAN

2087
00:49:15,533 --> 00:49:16,267
TO WORK?

2088
00:49:16,267 --> 00:49:17,633
>> YEAH, THAT'S WHY I'M SUPPOSED

2089
00:49:17,633 --> 00:49:19,367
TO BACK TO SCHOOL IN AUGUST,

2090
00:49:19,367 --> 00:49:20,833
BUT I PLAN ON GETTING MY G.E.D.

2091
00:49:20,833 --> 00:49:21,600
BEFORE SUMMER'S

2092
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:22,667
OVER SO I CAN WORK NEXT YEAR

2093
00:49:22,667 --> 00:49:23,900
INSTEAD OF BE IN SCHOOL.

2094
00:49:23,900 --> 00:49:24,700
>> OKAY.

2095
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:25,733
>> BECAUSE I HATE RELYING

2096
00:49:25,733 --> 00:49:26,500
ON OTHER PEOPLE

2097
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:27,600
TO PAY FOR MY CHILD.

2098
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:28,867
I CAN'T STAND THAT.

2099
00:49:28,867 --> 00:49:29,800
>> EVEN CODY?

2100
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,900
>> NO, THAT'S HIS CHILD TOO.

2101
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:31,900
HE SHOULD BE CONTRIBUTING.

2102
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:32,600
>> OKAY.

2103
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:34,100
AND WILL THERE BE DAYCARE THEN?

2104
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:34,800
OR WILL SOMEBODY ELSE

2105
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:35,867
BE TAKING CARE OF--

2106
00:49:35,867 --> 00:49:36,800
>> I'M GONNA WAIT

2107
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,967
UNTIL SHE'S ONE

2108
00:49:37,967 --> 00:49:39,200
SO SHE'S OLD ENOUGH TO LIKE

2109
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,833
GO TO MY MOM'S WHILE I WORK.

2110
00:49:41,833 --> 00:49:44,967
>> YOUR MOM HAD ONE RULE.

2111
00:49:44,967 --> 00:49:46,233
WHAT WAS THAT RULE?

2112
00:49:46,233 --> 00:49:47,067
>> DON'T GET PREGNANT.

2113
00:49:47,067 --> 00:49:48,733
>> THAT'S THE ONLY RULE.

2114
00:49:48,733 --> 00:49:49,933
>> YEAH.

2115
00:49:49,933 --> 00:49:51,267
>> YOU COULDN'T KEEP

2116
00:49:51,267 --> 00:49:52,133
THAT ONE RULE IN MIND?

2117
00:49:52,133 --> 00:49:52,800
>> WELL, I MEAN,

2118
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:55,133
I DIDN'T PLAN TO GET PREGNANT.

2119
00:49:55,133 --> 00:49:56,300
>> DID YOU USE BIRTH CONTROL?

2120
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,500
>> NO.

2121
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,233
>> OKAY,

2122
00:49:58,233 --> 00:49:59,067
ISN'T THAT THE SAME THING

2123
00:49:59,067 --> 00:49:59,867
AS PLANNING TO GET PREGNANT?

2124
00:49:59,867 --> 00:50:00,700
>> WELL, NO.

2125
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:01,667
>> HOW'S IT DIFFERENT?

2126
00:50:01,667 --> 00:50:02,567
>> BECAUSE I WASN'T PLANNING

2127
00:50:02,567 --> 00:50:03,967
ON HAVING SEX WITH ANYONE.

2128
00:50:03,967 --> 00:50:04,967
IF I WAS GONNA GET

2129
00:50:04,967 --> 00:50:06,333
IN A SERIOUS RELATIONSHIP,

2130
00:50:06,333 --> 00:50:08,233
THEN I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN

2131
00:50:08,233 --> 00:50:08,933
ON BIRTH CONTROL.

2132
00:50:08,933 --> 00:50:09,833
>> CODY, DO YOU WANT TO HAVE

2133
00:50:09,833 --> 00:50:10,867
A RELATIONSHIP WITH MADDY?

2134
00:50:10,867 --> 00:50:12,233
>> NO, I GOT A GIRLFRIEND

2135
00:50:12,233 --> 00:50:13,800
WITH THE OTHER GIRL

2136
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:14,633
I HAD A KID WITH.

2137
00:50:14,633 --> 00:50:15,567
>> SO YOU HAD SOMEBODY

2138
00:50:15,567 --> 00:50:16,767
PREGNANT--

2139
00:50:16,767 --> 00:50:17,933
>> I DIDN'T KNOW IT.

2140
00:50:17,933 --> 00:50:18,733
>> DO YOU STILL HAVE FEELINGS

2141
00:50:18,733 --> 00:50:19,433
FOR HIM?

2142
00:50:19,433 --> 00:50:20,100
>> NOT AT ALL.

2143
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:20,767
>> NOT AT ALL,

2144
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:21,567
>> NEVER. NO.

2145
00:50:21,567 --> 00:50:22,400
>> BUT YOU MUST HAVE SOMETHING

2146
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,167
BECAUSE HE'S THE DAD--

2147
00:50:23,167 --> 00:50:25,233
>> ANGER. THAT'S IT.

2148
00:50:25,233 --> 00:50:26,367
>> ANGER THAT?

2149
00:50:26,367 --> 00:50:27,700
>> THAT HE'S NOT IN HER LIFE.

2150
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:28,967
>> I WANT TO BE. I REALLY DO.

2151
00:50:28,967 --> 00:50:33,333
>> I FEEL BAD FOR MY DAUGHTER.

2152
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:34,200
I DON'T WANT HER TO GROW UP

2153
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:38,600
WITHOUT A DAD.

2154
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:39,600
>> DID YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR DAD

2155
00:50:39,600 --> 00:50:40,933
WAS TOO FAR AWAY FOR YOU?

2156
00:50:40,933 --> 00:50:41,633
>> NO.

2157
00:50:41,633 --> 00:50:42,300
>> NO.

2158
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,033
>> MY DAD HAS ALWAYS BEEN

2159
00:50:43,033 --> 00:50:43,667
THERE FOR ME.

2160
00:50:43,667 --> 00:50:44,533
LIKE, I'M A DADDY'S GIRL,

2161
00:50:44,533 --> 00:50:45,233
I KNOW THAT.

2162
00:50:45,233 --> 00:50:46,167
AND SHE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW

2163
00:50:46,167 --> 00:50:47,233
WHAT A DAD IS.

2164
00:50:47,233 --> 00:50:48,300
SHE HASN'T SEEN HIM

2165
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:52,433
SINCE SHE WAS TWO MONTHS OLD.

2166
00:50:52,433 --> 00:50:53,667
>> I HAVE NO PROBLEM, LIKE,

2167
00:50:53,667 --> 00:50:54,967
STEPPING UP AND TAKING THE ROLE.

2168
00:50:54,967 --> 00:50:56,367
I JUST WANT HELP

2169
00:50:56,367 --> 00:50:57,267
WITH THE DNA TEST,

2170
00:50:57,267 --> 00:50:58,700
THAT'S ALL I'VE BEEN ASKING.

2171
00:50:58,700 --> 00:50:59,467
>> BUT YOU SAID

2172
00:50:59,467 --> 00:51:00,900
IT'S NOT WORTH SEEING HER

2173
00:51:00,900 --> 00:51:02,133
IF YOU CAN'T TAKE HER OVERNIGHT.

2174
00:51:02,133 --> 00:51:02,933
YOU CAN'T. I'M SORRY.

2175
00:51:02,933 --> 00:51:03,600
I DON'T TRUST YOU.

2176
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:04,300
>> LIKE I CAN NEVER TAKE

2177
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:05,633
MY OWN DAUGHTER; I HAVE A KID.

2178
00:51:05,633 --> 00:51:06,467
I KNOW WHAT TO DO WITH BABIES.

2179
00:51:06,467 --> 00:51:07,133
>> LISTEN TO ME.

2180
00:51:07,133 --> 00:51:08,300
YOU HAD A MARIJUANA PLANT

2181
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:09,233
GROWING IN YOUR BACKYARD,

2182
00:51:09,233 --> 00:51:10,500
PLEASE DON'T DENY IT.

2183
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:12,133
>> BEFORE I HAD A KID, YEAH.

2184
00:51:12,133 --> 00:51:12,833
>> YEAH.

2185
00:51:12,833 --> 00:51:13,800
WHAT IF YOU DO IT AGAIN AND

2186
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:14,700
THE NEIGHBOR'S CALL THE COPS.

2187
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:15,433
MY DAUGHTER'S GONNA

2188
00:51:15,433 --> 00:51:16,100
GET TAKEN AWAY.

2189
00:51:16,100 --> 00:51:17,067
>> I'VE OBVIOUSLY STRAIGHTENED

2190
00:51:17,067 --> 00:51:17,933
MY LIFE UP; I'M A LOT DIFFERENT.

2191
00:51:17,933 --> 00:51:18,733
I DON'T PARTY OR NOTHING.

2192
00:51:18,733 --> 00:51:20,333
>> PATERNITY CAN BE ESTABLISHED

2193
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:21,767
ANYWHERE ALONG THE WAY HERE.

2194
00:51:21,767 --> 00:51:23,067
I'M JUST PLAYING THE ODDS.

2195
00:51:23,067 --> 00:51:25,533
YOU MIGHT WANT TO STEP UP, HM?

2196
00:51:25,533 --> 00:51:27,800
>> YEAH, WELL.

2197
00:51:27,800 --> 00:51:28,733
I DON'T KNOW.

2198
00:51:28,733 --> 00:51:30,533
WE NEED TO GET THIS DNA TEST.

2199
00:51:30,533 --> 00:51:32,833
THAT'S ALL I WANT.

2200
00:51:32,833 --> 00:51:34,167
>> I CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY

2201
00:51:34,167 --> 00:51:36,567
FOR THAT; I HAVE TO BUY DIAPERS

2202
00:51:36,567 --> 00:51:37,433
FOR YOUR CHILD

2203
00:51:37,433 --> 00:51:38,867
THAT YOU DON'T HELP WITH.

2204
00:51:38,867 --> 00:51:39,633
YOU HAVEN'T BOUGHT

2205
00:51:39,633 --> 00:51:40,300
A SINGLE THING.

2206
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,067
>> I SAID THAT'S

2207
00:51:41,067 --> 00:51:41,833
WHY I WANT A PATERNITY TEST.

2208
00:51:41,833 --> 00:51:42,567
>> OKAY, WELL, I

2209
00:51:42,567 --> 00:51:43,400
WANT STUFF FOR AUBREY.

2210
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:44,467
>> WHAT IF YOU SPLIT THE COST

2211
00:51:44,467 --> 00:51:45,567
OF THE PATERNITY TEST?

2212
00:51:45,567 --> 00:51:46,767
YOU BOTH ARE DEEPLY INVESTED--

2213
00:51:46,767 --> 00:51:47,733
>> BECAUSE, HE STILL HASN'T PAID

2214
00:51:47,733 --> 00:51:48,900
FOR ANYTHING FOR HER.

2215
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,100
>> HOW ABOUT THIS:

2216
00:51:51,100 --> 00:51:53,167
YOU SPLIT THE COST OF IT.

2217
00:51:53,167 --> 00:51:54,600
IF IT'S YOUR CHILD,

2218
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:55,533
YOU PAY HER BACK AND--

2219
00:51:55,533 --> 00:51:56,467
>> BECAUSE HE'S UNRELIABLE

2220
00:51:56,467 --> 00:51:57,200
AND HE WON'T.

2221
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:58,167
>> I'LL PAY YOU RIGHT BACK

2222
00:51:58,167 --> 00:51:59,467
AS SOON AS I GET IT.

2223
00:51:59,467 --> 00:52:00,800
>> OKAY, THAT'S A COMMITMENT

2224
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:02,400
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY HERE.

2225
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:03,233
>> IT STILL DOESN'T MEAN

2226
00:52:03,233 --> 00:52:03,933
ANYTHING TO ME.

2227
00:52:03,933 --> 00:52:04,700
I CAN'T BELIEVE ANYTHING

2228
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:05,333
HE HAS TO SAY.

2229
00:52:05,333 --> 00:52:06,200
HE'S SITTING UP HERE LYING

2230
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:07,233
IN FRONT OF EVERYONE, STILL.

2231
00:52:07,233 --> 00:52:09,067
>> OKAY.

2232
00:52:09,067 --> 00:52:10,233
LET'S TALK ABOUT SCHOOL.

2233
00:52:10,233 --> 00:52:11,567
WHAT'S THE PLAN?

2234
00:52:11,567 --> 00:52:12,533
>> I PLAN ON GETTING MY G.E.D.

2235
00:52:12,533 --> 00:52:13,400
THIS SUMMER.

2236
00:52:13,400 --> 00:52:14,533
I HAVE MY WITHDRAWAL LETTER

2237
00:52:14,533 --> 00:52:15,233
FROM SCHOOL.

2238
00:52:15,233 --> 00:52:15,967
I'M ALREADY SIGNED

2239
00:52:15,967 --> 00:52:17,667
UP I HAVEN'T PUT THE DATE YET

2240
00:52:17,667 --> 00:52:18,367
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW

2241
00:52:18,367 --> 00:52:19,300
WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO WITH HER

2242
00:52:19,300 --> 00:52:20,067
FOR TWO HOURS

2243
00:52:20,067 --> 00:52:20,933
WHILE I'M TAKING THE TEST.

2244
00:52:20,933 --> 00:52:22,133
>> OKAY. G.E.D.

2245
00:52:22,133 --> 00:52:23,700
AND THEN FURTHER EDUCATION?

2246
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:24,367
>> YEAH.

2247
00:52:24,367 --> 00:52:25,167
I PLAN ON GOING TO COLLEGE,

2248
00:52:25,167 --> 00:52:26,067
I JUST DON'T KNOW FOR SURE

2249
00:52:26,067 --> 00:52:26,767
WHAT YET.

2250
00:52:26,767 --> 00:52:27,667
BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE A LAWYER,

2251
00:52:27,667 --> 00:52:28,667
BUT I'M NOT GOING

2252
00:52:28,667 --> 00:52:29,667
TO DO THAT NOW.

2253
00:52:29,667 --> 00:52:31,567
>> OKAY, SO THAT DREAM, GONE.

2254
00:52:31,567 --> 00:52:33,200
>> YEAH.

2255
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,900
>> SO BIRTH CONTROL

2256
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:36,700
FOR YOU GOING FORWARD?

2257
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:37,367
>> I MEAN,

2258
00:52:37,367 --> 00:52:38,467
I PLAN ON GOING ON IT.

2259
00:52:38,467 --> 00:52:39,900
>> WHOA, WHAT BIRTH CONTROL

2260
00:52:39,900 --> 00:52:41,067
DO YOU HAVE PLANNED?

2261
00:52:41,067 --> 00:52:41,733
>> I.U.D.

2262
00:52:41,733 --> 00:52:42,433
>> I.U.D.

2263
00:52:42,433 --> 00:52:43,167
>> EVENTUALLY, YEAH.

2264
00:52:43,167 --> 00:52:44,133
>> I.U.D. MIRENA OR SOMETHING?

2265
00:52:44,133 --> 00:52:44,833
>> YEAH.

2266
00:52:44,833 --> 00:52:45,533
>> WHY EVENTUALLY.

2267
00:52:45,533 --> 00:52:46,200
WHY NOT NOW?

2268
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:46,867
>> I DON'T KNOW.

2269
00:52:46,867 --> 00:52:47,600
I JUST HAVEN'T GOTTEN

2270
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:48,267
TO DO IT YET.

2271
00:52:48,267 --> 00:52:49,067
>> DO YOU HAVE A BOYFRIEND?

2272
00:52:49,067 --> 00:52:49,733
>> NO.

2273
00:52:49,733 --> 00:52:50,633
I'M NOT EVEN TALKING TO ANYONE.

2274
00:52:50,633 --> 00:52:51,833
>> ARE YOU SEXUALLY ACTIVE?

2275
00:52:51,833 --> 00:52:52,933
>> NO, HONESTLY I DON'T EVEN

2276
00:52:52,933 --> 00:52:54,600
THINK ABOUT SEX ANYMORE.

2277
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,600
I FEEL LIKE MOMS DON'T HAVE SEX.

2278
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:58,133
I FEEL DISGUSTING EVEN, LIKE,

2279
00:52:58,133 --> 00:52:59,833
THINKING ABOUT IT.

2280
00:52:59,833 --> 00:53:00,600
>> CODY, WHAT DO YOU DO

2281
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,233
FOR BIRTH CONTROL NOW?

2282
00:53:02,233 --> 00:53:03,067
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

2283
00:53:03,067 --> 00:53:03,833
I DON'T TAKE BIRTH CONTROL.

2284
00:53:03,833 --> 00:53:05,900
>> I KNOW YOU DON'T.

2285
00:53:05,900 --> 00:53:06,600
WHAT ARE YOU DOING

2286
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:07,500
TO DEAL WITH--

2287
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,867
>> I USE A CONDOM NOW.

2288
00:53:09,867 --> 00:53:10,633
>> YOU USE CONDOMS.

2289
00:53:10,633 --> 00:53:11,667
>> YEAH.

2290
00:53:11,667 --> 00:53:12,733
>> HOW IS AUBREY?

2291
00:53:12,733 --> 00:53:14,133
>> GREAT.

2292
00:53:14,133 --> 00:53:15,067
SHE'S THE MOST HAPPY BABY

00:53:15,067 --> 00:53:16,633
THERE IS.

2294
00:53:16,633 --> 00:53:17,333

SHE'S GREAT.

2298
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:25,767

00:53:25,767 --> 00:53:26,600

2301
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,600
>> I HOPE THINGS WORK OUT BETTER

2302
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:31,733
THAN THEY HAVE BEEN.

2303
00:53:31,733 --> 00:53:33,633
>> OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

00:53:33,633 --> 00:53:34,333
THANK YOU, GUYS.

2313
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:45,100
HOW MUCH THEY'VE GROWN UP.

00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:47,200
BE RIGHT BACK.

00:53:53,733 --> 00:53:56,767

2319
00:53:56,767 --> 00:53:57,433

THERE ARE PRESENTLY

AROUND 733,000 TEEN PREGNANCIES

2322
00:54:01,933 --> 00:54:03,400
IN THE U.S. EVERY YEAR.

2323
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,133
WE DOCUMENTED 12 IN THIS SEASON

2324
00:54:05,133 --> 00:54:06,267

00:54:13,567 --> 00:54:15,767
THANKS FOR JOINING US.

2330
00:54:15,767 --> 00:54:16,600
IN YOUR EPISODE,

2331
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,867
WE SAW YOU TELLING MAHWI, RIGHT?

2332
00:54:18,867 --> 00:54:19,633
THAT YOU WERE NOT READY

2333
00:54:19,633 --> 00:54:20,833
FOR A ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIP.

2334
00:54:20,833 --> 00:54:21,500
>> RIGHT.

2335
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,367
>> SO THAT ENDED.

2336
00:54:22,367 --> 00:54:23,067
>> MM-HMM.

2337
00:54:23,067 --> 00:54:24,267
WHERE ARE WE AT NOW?

2338
00:54:24,267 --> 00:54:26,733
>> ME AND MAHWI ARE FRIENDS.

2339
00:54:26,733 --> 00:54:28,067
WE'RE GOOD CLOSE FRIENDS.

2340
00:54:28,067 --> 00:54:28,833
WE TALK TO EACH OTHER ABOUT,

2341
00:54:28,833 --> 00:54:31,333
HE'S KIND OF LIKE A BEST FRIEND.

2342
00:54:31,333 --> 00:54:32,400
STILL NOT LOOKING

2343
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:33,233
FOR A RELATIONSHIP

2344
00:54:33,233 --> 00:54:34,667
OR TO BE INTIMATE ANYTIME SOON.

2345
00:54:34,667 --> 00:54:35,733
>> SO YOU'RE NOT DATING ANYBODY?

2346
00:54:35,733 --> 00:54:36,400
>> NO.

2347
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:37,233
>> YOU KNOW,

2348
00:54:37,233 --> 00:54:39,267
YOUR AUNT'S HERE, LADONNA,

2349
00:54:39,267 --> 00:54:40,067
AND I THINK

2350
00:54:40,067 --> 00:54:41,767
SHE HAD SOME CONCERNS.

2351
00:54:41,767 --> 00:54:42,800
LADONNA, IS THAT RIGHT?

2352
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:43,700
SHE'S NOT INTIMATE WITH ANYBODY

2353
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:44,367
RIGHT NOW?

2354
00:54:44,367 --> 00:54:45,167
>> I DON'T KNOW

2355
00:54:45,167 --> 00:54:46,567
IF SHE'S INTIMATE OR NOT,

2356
00:54:46,567 --> 00:54:49,800
BUT I KNOW THAT HER SON'S FATHER

2357
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:51,567
HAS BEEN COMING BACK AROUND.

2358
00:54:51,567 --> 00:54:54,500
>> OH. WHAT'S UP WITH THAT?

2359
00:54:54,500 --> 00:54:56,333
>> HE ACTUALLY DID COME

2360
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:57,367
AROUND TO SEE HIS SON

2361
00:54:57,367 --> 00:54:58,067
FOR THE FIRST TIME

2362
00:54:58,067 --> 00:54:59,067
IN THREE MONTHS.

2363
00:54:59,067 --> 00:55:00,400
OF COURSE ALLOWED HIM TO

2364
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,267
BECAUSE THAT'S HIS DAD.

2365
00:55:01,267 --> 00:55:02,067
I WANT TO SEE

2366
00:55:02,067 --> 00:55:03,967
HIM INTERACT WITH HIS SON.

2367
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,533
THAT'S ABOUT IT. NOTHING MORE.

2368
00:55:05,533 --> 00:55:06,367
>> DID YOU GUYS HOOK UP?

2369
00:55:06,367 --> 00:55:08,067
>> NO. NO.

2370
00:55:08,067 --> 00:55:08,900
>> LADONNA, NO?

2371
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:09,733
>> I THINK THEY DID.

2372
00:55:09,733 --> 00:55:11,433
>> I WAS ON VACATION

2373
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:12,900
FOR ABOUT THREE WEEKS,

2374
00:55:12,900 --> 00:55:15,700
AND HE DIDN'T COME AROUND

2375
00:55:15,700 --> 00:55:17,067
UNTIL I LEFT.

2376
00:55:17,067 --> 00:55:17,700
>> OH, INTERESTING.

2377
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:18,900
>> SO THAT WAS SUSPECT

2378
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:20,167
TO ME RIGHT THERE.

2379
00:55:20,167 --> 00:55:20,833
>> DOES HE HAVE, LIKE,

2380
00:55:20,833 --> 00:55:21,800
OTHER KIDS?

2381
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:22,467
>> YES.

2382
00:55:22,467 --> 00:55:23,567
>> HOW MANY?

2383
00:55:23,567 --> 00:55:24,533
>> HE HAS THREE OTHER CHILDREN

2384
00:55:24,533 --> 00:55:25,200
THAT I KNOW OF.

2385
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,167
>> SO HE HAS FOUR?

2386
00:55:27,167 --> 00:55:27,833
>> SIX.

2387
00:55:27,833 --> 00:55:30,067
HE PROBABLY HAS SIX OR SEVEN.

2388
00:55:30,067 --> 00:55:30,733
BUT THERE'S--

2389
00:55:30,733 --> 00:55:31,700
>> SIX KIDS? HOW OLD IS HE?

2390
00:55:31,700 --> 00:55:33,633
HE'S 19,

2391
00:55:33,633 --> 00:55:36,200
AND IT WAS FIVE BEFORE HERS.

2392
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:37,367
>> HE'S A MENACE.

2393
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:39,167
>> YEAH.

2394
00:55:39,167 --> 00:55:39,900
>> RIGHT.

2395
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:40,567
>> MM-HMM.

2396
00:55:40,567 --> 00:55:41,267
>> MAHWI SEEMED

2397
00:55:41,267 --> 00:55:42,267
LIKE SUCH A GOOD GUY.

2398
00:55:42,267 --> 00:55:42,933
>> HE IS.

2399
00:55:42,933 --> 00:55:43,833
>> AND HE'S WAITING

2400
00:55:43,833 --> 00:55:44,800
AROUND FOR YOU.

2401
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:45,900
DON'T KID YOURSELF.

2402
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:46,667
HE DOESN'T WANT TO JUST

2403
00:55:46,667 --> 00:55:47,367
BE FRIENDS.

2404
00:55:47,367 --> 00:55:48,200
HE WANTS A LITTLE MORE.

2405
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,067
HE'S WILLING TO SETTLE

2406
00:55:49,067 --> 00:55:49,567
FOR FRIEND.

2407
00:55:49,567 --> 00:55:50,533
>> RIGHT.

2408
00:55:50,533 --> 00:55:51,167
>> NO?

2409
00:55:51,167 --> 00:55:53,533
>> NO.

2410
00:55:53,533 --> 00:55:54,533
>> KARLEY, YOU HAVE TWINS.

2411
00:55:54,533 --> 00:55:55,167
>> YES.

2412
00:55:55,167 --> 00:55:56,200
>> BEING A TEENAGER,

2413
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,067
BEING A TEEN MOM,

2414
00:55:57,067 --> 00:55:58,633
HAVING A BABY AT ANY AGE,

2415
00:55:58,633 --> 00:56:01,067
BUT TWINS, OH, MY GOD.

2416
00:56:01,067 --> 00:56:01,900
HOW DO YOU DEAL?

2417
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:02,900
>> IT'S NOT AS TERRIBLE

2418
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:03,800
AS EVERYONE MADE IT OUT TO BE,

2419
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:05,067
BUT IT'S DEFINITELY HARD.

2420
00:56:05,067 --> 00:56:05,700
>> WHERE ARE YOU LIVING

2421
00:56:05,700 --> 00:56:06,433
THESE DAYS?

2422
00:56:06,433 --> 00:56:07,267
>> TONY AND I ARE LIVING

2423
00:56:07,267 --> 00:56:09,367
IN A TOWNHOME OF OUR OWN.

2424
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:11,167
WE MOVED OUT OF MY MOM'S HOUSE.

2425
00:56:11,167 --> 00:56:12,567
>> OH, FANTASTIC.

2426
00:56:12,567 --> 00:56:13,467
HOW ARE YOU AFFORDING

2427
00:56:13,467 --> 00:56:15,467
THE LIVING SITUATION NOW?

2428
00:56:15,467 --> 00:56:17,267
>> WELL, TONY WORKS FULL TIME.

2429
00:56:17,267 --> 00:56:18,633
>> SO HE'S STEPPING UP?

2430
00:56:18,633 --> 00:56:19,367
>> OH, YEAH.

2431
00:56:19,367 --> 00:56:20,833
HE'S STEPPED UP A LOT.

2432
00:56:20,833 --> 00:56:21,667
>> ISN'T THAT WHAT YOUR MOM

2433
00:56:21,667 --> 00:56:22,733
WAS CONCERNED ABOUT?

2434
00:56:22,733 --> 00:56:23,667
>> WELL, SHE WAS JUST CONCERNED

2435
00:56:23,667 --> 00:56:24,933
FOR ME IN GENERAL.

2436
00:56:24,933 --> 00:56:26,533
SHE WAS SCARED FOR ME.

2437
00:56:26,533 --> 00:56:27,533
HER 17-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER

2438
00:56:27,533 --> 00:56:28,267
WAS HAVING TWINS

2439
00:56:28,267 --> 00:56:28,933
SO SHE WAS JUST SCARED

2440
00:56:28,933 --> 00:56:30,800
IN GENERAL.

2441
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:31,933
>> NOW, ALEAH, SHAWN

2442
00:56:31,933 --> 00:56:33,100
WAS PREVIOUSLY A DAD, RIGHT?

2443
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,533
>> MM-HMM.

2444
00:56:34,533 --> 00:56:35,200
>> NOW YOU KNOW

2445
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,433
WHAT THAT'S ALL ABOUT.

2446
00:56:36,433 --> 00:56:37,167
WHAT ARE YOUR THOUGHTS

2447
00:56:37,167 --> 00:56:39,633
ABOUT BIRTH CONTROL?

2448
00:56:39,633 --> 00:56:40,633
>> I GUESS JUST

2449
00:56:40,633 --> 00:56:41,700
BE SMART ABOUT IT.

2450
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:42,667
I THINK IT'S SOMETHING

2451
00:56:42,667 --> 00:56:43,933
THAT NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE

2452
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:45,833
KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT, YOU KNOW.

2453
00:56:45,833 --> 00:56:47,700
I KNEW THERE WAS BIRTH CONTROL.

2454
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,067
BUT IF YOU ASK A LOT OF TEENS

2455
00:56:49,067 --> 00:56:50,267
WHAT TYPE OF BIRTH CONTROL

2456
00:56:50,267 --> 00:56:51,067
THERE IS, WHAT WOULD BE

2457
00:56:51,067 --> 00:56:52,167
THE BEST OPTION FOR THEM,

2458
00:56:52,167 --> 00:56:53,433
THEY HAVE NO CLUE.

2459
00:56:53,433 --> 00:56:54,467
YOU KNOW, SO--

2460
00:56:54,467 --> 00:56:55,733
>> WHAT ARE THE RESTRICTIONS

2461
00:56:55,733 --> 00:56:56,700
YOU HAVE IN TERMS

2462
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:58,167
OF WHAT BIRTH CONTROL CHOICES

2463
00:56:58,167 --> 00:57:00,167
YOU HAVE AS A DIABETIC?

2464
00:57:00,167 --> 00:57:00,900
>> REALLY, AS FAR

2465
00:57:00,900 --> 00:57:02,667
AS I WAS CONCERNED, EVERYTHING

2466
00:57:02,667 --> 00:57:04,367
OTHER THAN THE PILL WAS OKAY.

2467
00:57:04,367 --> 00:57:05,167
>> WHAT ARE YOU TAKING?

2468
00:57:05,167 --> 00:57:06,800
>> I HAVE THE IMPLANON

2469
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,433
IN MY ARM.

2470
00:57:08,433 --> 00:57:09,433
>> SO IT'S GOOD FOR THREE YEARS?

2471
00:57:09,433 --> 00:57:10,267
FIVE YEARS? THREE YEARS.

2472
00:57:10,267 --> 00:57:11,067
>> MM-HMM. THREE YEARS.

2473
00:57:11,067 --> 00:57:12,800
>> AND YOUR BABY ENDED UP

2474
00:57:12,800 --> 00:57:14,100
IN THE NEONATAL I.C.U.,

2475
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:14,800
AND A LOT OF THAT WAS

2476
00:57:14,800 --> 00:57:16,267
COMPLICATIONS OF THE DIABETES,

2477
00:57:16,267 --> 00:57:17,067
RIGHT?

2478
00:57:17,067 --> 00:57:17,633
>> YES.

2479
00:57:17,633 --> 00:57:18,300
>> HOW ARE THINGS NOW

2480
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:19,167
WITH THE BABY?

2481
00:57:19,167 --> 00:57:20,367
>> SHE'S PERFECTLY HEALTHY.

2482
00:57:20,367 --> 00:57:23,633
>> AND YOUR HEALTH.

2483
00:57:23,633 --> 00:57:26,800
>> I'M GONNA CRY.

2484
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:27,800
THE N.I.C.U. WAS THE HARDEST

2485
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,800
PART OF MY ENTIRE LIFE.

2486
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:31,567
BECAUSE, I MEAN, AS SOON

2487
00:57:31,567 --> 00:57:32,467
AS YOU HAVE YOUR BABY

2488
00:57:32,467 --> 00:57:34,700
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT HER.

2489
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:35,633
PROTECT YOUR BABY

2490
00:57:35,633 --> 00:57:36,533
FROM ALL OF THAT STUFF

2491
00:57:36,533 --> 00:57:37,167
AND THEN YOU

2492
00:57:37,167 --> 00:57:37,833
GO INTO THE N.I.C.U.

2493
00:57:37,833 --> 00:57:38,833
AND YOUR BABY HAS AN I.V.

2494
00:57:38,833 --> 00:57:39,533
IN HER HEAD

2495
00:57:39,533 --> 00:57:41,533
AND SHE'S GETTING HER FEET

2496
00:57:41,533 --> 00:57:43,200
POKED LITERALLY EVERY TWO HOURS.

2497
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:46,067
THAT WAS PAINFUL TO SEE,

2498
00:57:46,067 --> 00:57:46,900
AND THEN I'M IN PAIN.

2499
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:47,733
I JUST HAD LABOR,

2500
00:57:47,733 --> 00:57:49,100
AND I'M WALKING BETWEEN MY FLOOR

2501
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:49,800
AND THE N.I.C.U.

2502
00:57:49,800 --> 00:57:52,167
LITERALLY EVERY TWO HOURS.

2503
00:57:52,167 --> 00:57:53,933
IT WAS A LOT.

2504
00:57:53,933 --> 00:57:55,700
>> I DON'T MEAN TO IMPLY THIS

2505
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:56,667
BY ASKING THIS QUESTION,

2506
00:57:56,667 --> 00:57:57,367
BUT SOME PEOPLE

2507
00:57:57,367 --> 00:57:58,267
WOULD FEEL THIS WAY.

2508
00:57:58,267 --> 00:57:59,800
DID YOU FEEL RESPONSIBLE

2509
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,167
SINCE IT WAS YOUR DIABETES--

2510
00:58:01,167 --> 00:58:02,567
YEAH, THE DIABETES

2511
00:58:02,567 --> 00:58:03,733
CREATED THE SITUATION

2512
00:58:03,733 --> 00:58:04,633
SO YOU BLAMED YOURSELF.

2513
00:58:04,633 --> 00:58:05,633
>> YEAH, I MEAN,

2514
00:58:05,633 --> 00:58:07,533
OF COURSE THERE WAS THINGS

2515
00:58:07,533 --> 00:58:08,567
THAT I COULD HAVE DONE BETTER,

2516
00:58:08,567 --> 00:58:11,633
BUT I REALLY DID TRY MY BEST.

2517
00:58:11,633 --> 00:58:12,533
WHEN I WAS PREGNANT

2518
00:58:12,533 --> 00:58:14,133
WAS THE BEST EFFORT

2519
00:58:14,133 --> 00:58:14,867
I HAD EVER

2520
00:58:14,867 --> 00:58:16,467
PUT IN WITH MY DIABETES,

2521
00:58:16,467 --> 00:58:17,933
BECAUSE I'VE ALWAYS BEEN

2522
00:58:17,933 --> 00:58:18,600
A PERSON

2523
00:58:18,600 --> 00:58:19,367
WHO CARES WAY MORE ABOUT

2524
00:58:19,367 --> 00:58:21,200
OTHER PEOPLE THAN MYSELF.

2525
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:24,400
>> HOW'S YOUR SUGAR RIGHT NOW?

2526
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:26,433
>> IT WASN'T GOOD EARLIER.

2527
00:58:26,433 --> 00:58:29,533
>> HOW COME?

2528
00:58:29,533 --> 00:58:30,300
>> I FEEL LIKE I HAVE A LOT

2529
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:31,933
GOING ON, YOU KNOW,

2530
00:58:31,933 --> 00:58:34,067
BECAUSE WHEN I'M NOT DEALING

2531
00:58:34,067 --> 00:58:34,700
WITH PEYTON,

2532
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:35,600
I'M DEALING WITH NOAH.

2533
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:36,667
WHEN I'M NOT DEALING WITH NOAH,

2534
00:58:36,667 --> 00:58:37,600
I'M DEALING WITH PEYTON.

2535
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:39,233
SO IT'S LIKE I NEVER REALLY

2536
00:58:39,233 --> 00:58:39,967
HAVE THE TIME

2537
00:58:39,967 --> 00:58:41,167
TO TRACK MY BLOOD LIKE I SHOULD.

2538
00:58:41,167 --> 00:58:43,200
I DON'T EAT LIKE I SHOULD.

2539
00:58:43,200 --> 00:58:43,867
>> IT'S HARD.

2540
00:58:43,867 --> 00:58:44,600
>> YEAH.

2541
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:47,867
>> SHAWN WANTED A VASECTOMY?

2542
00:58:47,867 --> 00:58:50,867
TALK TO ME ABOUT THAT?

2543
00:58:50,867 --> 00:58:51,833
DID HE HAVE IT?

2544
00:58:51,833 --> 00:58:53,367
>> NO, WE HAD A LONG TALK

2545
00:58:53,367 --> 00:58:54,600
ABOUT IT.

2546
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,833
AND HE WANTS TO GET A VASECTOMY

2547
00:58:56,833 --> 00:58:57,900
AFTER THE IMPLANON,

2548
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:58,867
BECAUSE WE BOTH AGREE,

2549
00:58:58,867 --> 00:59:01,067
WE DON'T WANT ANYMORE KIDS.

2550
00:59:01,067 --> 00:59:02,633
WE WANT TO FOCUS ALL OF OUR LOVE

2551
00:59:02,633 --> 00:59:04,867
ON THE TWO THAT WE HAVE.

2552
00:59:04,867 --> 00:59:06,133
IT'S ALREADY HARD TO SPLIT

2553
00:59:06,133 --> 00:59:08,067
OUR ATTENTION BETWEEN THE TWO,

2554
00:59:08,067 --> 00:59:09,533
I COULDN'T IMAGINE SPLITTING

2555
00:59:09,533 --> 00:59:11,367
IT BETWEEN THREE.

2556
00:59:11,367 --> 00:59:12,833
AND WITH MY HEALTH,

2557
00:59:12,833 --> 00:59:15,067
I WOULD NEVER ENDANGER

2558
00:59:15,067 --> 00:59:16,433
ANOTHER BABY LIKE THAT.

2559
00:59:16,433 --> 00:59:18,433
AND TO BE HONEST, I DON'T THINK

2560
00:59:18,433 --> 00:59:20,100
MY BODY COULD HANDLE IT.

2561
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:21,767
I THINK THAT EITHER MY KIDNEYS

2562
00:59:21,767 --> 00:59:24,067
OR SOME OTHER VITAL ORGAN

2563
00:59:24,067 --> 00:59:25,467
WOULD GO OUT.

2564
00:59:25,467 --> 00:59:26,267
>> THAT'S REALISTIC.

2565
00:59:26,267 --> 00:59:26,933
>> YEAH.

2566
00:59:26,933 --> 00:59:29,067
>> TAKE CARE

2567
00:59:29,067 --> 00:59:31,167
OF YOUR DIABETES, HM?

2568
00:59:31,167 --> 00:59:32,700
>> I'LL TRY.

2569
00:59:32,700 --> 00:59:35,133
>> JAZMINE, WHAT'S UP WITH DEL?

2570
00:59:35,133 --> 00:59:36,067
>> I DON'T KNOW.

2571
00:59:36,067 --> 00:59:36,700
>> YOU DON'T KNOW?

2572
00:59:36,700 --> 00:59:38,633
>> I DON'T TALK TO HIM.

2573
00:59:38,633 --> 00:59:39,900
>> WELL, THAT'S THE CURRENT

2574
00:59:39,900 --> 00:59:41,433
STATUS; YOU DON'T SPEAK?

2575
00:59:41,433 --> 00:59:44,067
>> NO, WE DON'T.

2576
00:59:44,067 --> 00:59:45,567
>> WAS THAT REALLY ABOUT

2577
00:59:45,567 --> 00:59:46,633
THE HOUSE RULES OR WAS THERE

2578
00:59:46,633 --> 00:59:47,367
SOMETHING ELSE GOING ON?

2579
00:59:47,367 --> 00:59:48,133
>> NO. NOT AT ALL.

2580
00:59:48,133 --> 00:59:50,500
HE ONLY HAD A PART TIME JOB,

2581
00:59:50,500 --> 00:59:51,500
AND SO...

2582
00:59:51,500 --> 00:59:54,367
HE WOULD SLEEP ALL MORNING,

2583
00:59:54,367 --> 00:59:55,067
GO TO WORK

2584
00:59:55,067 --> 00:59:55,967
FOR THREE OR FOUR HOURS,

2585
00:59:55,967 --> 00:59:56,700
AND THEN HE WOULD GO

2586
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:57,867
TO HIS FRIEND'S HOUSE,

2587
00:59:57,867 --> 00:59:58,633
AND HE WOULD COME OVER

2588
00:59:58,633 --> 00:59:59,300
TO OUR HOUSE

2589
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:00,000
TO SEE LAILA AT 10:00

2590
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,333
OR 11:00 AT NIGHT.

2591
01:00:01,333 --> 01:00:02,067
SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE.

2592
01:00:02,067 --> 01:00:03,000
"NO, WE'RE GOING TO SLEEP.

2593
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:04,067
YOU CAN'T COME HERE THAT LATE,

2594
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:04,933
GOOD-BYE."

2595
01:00:04,933 --> 01:00:07,200
AND SO HE FELT LIKE BECAUSE HE

2596
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:08,033
HAD A DAUGHTER THERE, HE COULD

2597
01:00:08,033 --> 01:00:09,000
COME ANY TIME HE WANTED,

2598
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:09,833
AND THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

2599
01:00:09,833 --> 01:00:10,533
IT'S LIKE, "NO, YOU

2600
01:00:10,533 --> 01:00:12,067
CAN COME EARLIER IN THE DAY,"

2601
01:00:12,067 --> 01:00:13,600
OR, YOU KNOW...

2602
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:14,267

2603
01:00:14,267 --> 01:00:15,367

>> NO, ONE DAY HE CAME,

2605
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,333
HE RUNG THE DOORBELL AND,

2606
01:00:19,333 --> 01:00:20,900
LIKE, THREW A BOX OF DIAPERS

2607
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:21,567
AT THE DOOR.

2608
01:00:21,567 --> 01:00:22,433
THEY WERE, LIKE, A SIZE FOUR,

2609
01:00:22,433 --> 01:00:24,333
AND SHE'S ONLY A SIZE TWO.

2610
01:00:24,333 --> 01:00:26,933
LIKE, NO.

2611
01:00:26,933 --> 01:00:28,033
>> ARE YOU SEEING ANYBODY?

2612
01:00:28,033 --> 01:00:28,900
>> YEAH, KIND OF, YEAH.

2613
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:31,767
>> OH. TELL ME ABOUT THAT?

2614
01:00:31,767 --> 01:00:33,033
>> IT'S GOOD.

2615
01:00:33,033 --> 01:00:34,300
I JUST--I DON'T WANT

2616
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:36,333

2617
01:00:36,333 --> 01:00:38,567

01:00:38,567 --> 01:00:39,467
I FEEL LIKE WITH DEL,

2619
01:00:39,467 --> 01:00:41,000
I FEEL LIKE I MET SOMEONE,

2620
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:42,233

01:00:42,233 --> 01:00:43,400

2627
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:50,733

01:00:50,733 --> 01:00:52,100
LIKE, I SAID I'M MOVING SLOW.

2629
