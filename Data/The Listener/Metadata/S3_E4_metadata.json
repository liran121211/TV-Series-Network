The case is nuanced and far-reaching because the victim, Ibrahim Ayim, is the son of Abassi Ayim, a deposed Liberian politician accused of defrauding his country of millions and committing a slew of atrocities. Toby has trouble getting solid insights since Abassi is cold and calculating and his bodyguard, Rafiq, keeps him at bay. The IIB team finds a promising lead with Dennis Harwell, an outspoken political blogger whose agenda is to ruin Abassi for his litany of crimes. Harwell's motive is clearly personal, but so are the motives of the other suspects: Ibrahim's estranged mother (Reta), Habisi, who runs a Liberian social club, and even potentially Rafiq. When the kidnappers send Ibrahim's severed finger to prove the temerity of their ten million dollar ransom demand, Michelle puts the pressure on Toby to make sense of the barrage of violent images he sees.\u2014Anonymous"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2103046", "rating": 7.3, "votes": 80, "number_of_episodes": 65}
