Is this a copycat murder or was the murderer Michelle put away innocent?", "A woman's death features the same serpentine M.O. as Samuel Murley, a killer Sgt. McCluskey brought to justice years ago. Since he's been in prison for three years, Toby helps IIB determine if Michelle arrested the wrong man or if they have a copycat murder on their hands. With newscasts calling foul, Toby's initial read casts doubts on the right man being incarcerated, and Michelle, already on maternity leave, finds herself shunted aside by superiors disassociating their connection.\u2014statmanjeff"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "3240108", "rating": 7.8, "votes": 68, "number_of_episodes": 65}
