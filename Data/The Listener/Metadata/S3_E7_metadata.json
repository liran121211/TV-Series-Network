Oz quietly admits to Toby that he's ready to move on, and possibly with Elyse, when Sandy surprises him. She's back early from Africa and can't wait to catch up. At a swanky dinner, a small group of pharmaceutical executives celebrate a record-breaking year while outside irate protesters assemble. CEO Jeffrey Brandt toasts their success, but the self-congratulatory speech is hijacked by Harold Kalb - a protester disguised as a waiter. Kalb disrupts the proceedings in a rage. As Brandt calls for security, he suddenly collapses followed in succession by other guests. With Brandt now dead, and five others very ill, Toby, Michelle and Klein discover additional casualties. Apparently, the drug they were lauding was responsible for at least four patient's deaths, and with the pharma victims intentionally poisoned, it appears vengeance is the motive.\u2014Anonymous"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2126105", "rating": 7.8, "votes": 78, "number_of_episodes": 65}
