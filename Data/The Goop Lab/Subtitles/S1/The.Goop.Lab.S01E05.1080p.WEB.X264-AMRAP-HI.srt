1
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:09,676
When I started goop in 2008,
I was like,

2
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:11,928
"My calling is something else besides,
you know,

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,472
making out with Matt Damon onscreen
or whatever."

4
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:15,556
[laughs]

5
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,436
And now, it's this modern lifestyle brand.

6
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,024
To me, it's all laddering up to one thing,
which is optimization of self.

7
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,192
Like, we're here one time, one life...

8
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,112
How can we really, like,
milk the shit out of this?

9
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,196
[laughing]

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,532
You have a hundred needles
in your face, Elise.

11
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:34,826
- [chuckling]
- Just another day at the office.

12
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:37,537
The opportunity that we have
with the goop lab

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,665
is that, as a company,
we can go out in different groups

14
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,918
and go on a much deeper dive
into some of these topics

15
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,712
that our readers are curious about.

16
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:48,089
- [laughing]
- This is gonna be my first experience

17
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,442
- with mushrooms.
- [Gillian] Oh!

18
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,593
- [exhales]
- [woman] You have to let go of your ego.

19
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,112
[Gwyneth] So, what happens in a workshop?

20
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,679
- Everyone gets off.
- [woman moaning]

21
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,848
What the fuck are you doing to people?

22
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,183
[man vocalizing]

23
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:02,228
We get to explore, like,
is this real? Do we feel better?

24
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:05,148
And grapple with some topics
that are hard

25
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,816
and embarrassing or shameful.

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,318
Isn't that beautiful?

27
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,694
- [sighs]
- [woman 2] Relax.

28
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,696
That was, like, next level shit.

29
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,076
So, are you guys ready to go out
in the field and make a ruckus?

30
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,161
- [Elise] Yeah.
- You can handle it, right?

31
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,871
[laughing]

32
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,298
[John Amaral]
The entire universe is made of energy.

33
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:38,473
Only 4.6% of the universe
is considered physical matter.

34
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:39,575
[roller coaster riders screaming]

35
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,559
[John]
The human body has an energy field...

36
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:42,769
- [snaps]
- [woman moans]

37
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:44,771
...and we're processing
the world through it.

38
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:47,273
All right, come on up sitting.

39
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,487
The more connected you are energetically,
the healthier you will feel.

40
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,280
[sighs]

41
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,951
[John] So often people don't slow down
and connect,

42
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,285
especially the Western world.

43
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:02,413
We value achievement over fulfillment.

44
00:02:02,497 --> 00:02:04,040
[indistinct chattering]

45
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:08,878
[John] But I believe the 21st Century
is the age of energy.

46
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,673
[woman] Close your eyes. One more, inhale.

47
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,608
[John] We're gonna see this
holistic approach in Western medicine.

48
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,305
Now I'm gonna send that energy through.

49
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,724
We're gonna see energy healing
more and more.

50
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,228
My body was, like, waving and reacting.

51
00:02:25,353 --> 00:02:26,673
[John] There you go, right there.

52
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:28,398
[John exhales]

53
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:33,069
[Gwyneth] The first time that John worked
on me, I really just cried.

54
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,406
[groaning loudly]

55
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:38,366
I had an exorcism.

56
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:40,743
[grunts, coughs]

57
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:41,870
[John] Beautiful.

58
00:02:43,746 --> 00:02:44,873
[Elise moans]

59
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:54,716
- What the fuck are you doing to people?
- [laughter]

60
00:02:56,718 --> 00:03:00,471
So, I work with energy as a body worker
and a chiropractor.

61
00:03:00,555 --> 00:03:03,099
You have energy that's bound up
in the muscles and ligaments

62
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:07,228
and spine and fascia and organs
when you're under stress.

63
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:10,440
So I show up and actually influence
how energy's moving,

64
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,317
so that your body can heal faster

65
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,568
in your physical being,

66
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:16,029
your emotional being,
your mind, your soul.

67
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:20,074
Do you find in your practice
that you see people who have diseases

68
00:03:20,158 --> 00:03:22,452
and that through the energy work
things start to shift?

69
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,369
Yeah, for sure.

70
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:25,973
I'm not treating a particular condition
when I'm working with people,

71
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,373
but I have a hypothesis:

72
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:31,461
If you just change the frequency
of vibration of the body itself,

73
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,504
it changes the way the cells regrow,

74
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,381
it changes how the sensory system
processes.

75
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:37,185
- It's amazingly integrated.
- [Elise] Yeah.

76
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:41,888
Dr. Lekkos, as an integrated physician,
how do you relate to this?

77
00:03:41,971 --> 00:03:43,973
I've been studying energy medicine
for a few years,

78
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,767
things like magnet therapy,

79
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,062
laser therapy, light therapy,
vibrational therapy

80
00:03:49,145 --> 00:03:51,689
and how they're manipulating
the energetic field of a person

81
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:54,359
to heal or break up tissue, et cetera.

82
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:58,529
So, we're seeing more of this manifest
in our medical system.

83
00:03:58,613 --> 00:03:59,447
Yeah.

84
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,009
In the United States right now,
there's integrative medicine residencies

85
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:04,327
to teach physicians how
to treat people with energy

86
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,662
- with their hands.
- Right.

87
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,081
So, John is trying to teach me
a few pointers and things.

88
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:12,460
I hear that this is the first time
you've ever let anybody film your work.

89
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:15,338
Mm-hmm. You know, out of context,
what I'm doing looks...

90
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,006
it just looks wacky, you know?

91
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:19,968
Because people might be wondering,
"Is this person having a seizure?

92
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:23,680
Is this an exorcism?
Is this person, um, having an orgasm?

93
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:24,806
What's happening here?"

94
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:26,516
- Right? So...
- I wish.

95
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:27,892
You know? [laughs]

96
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:30,353
So, I've been hesitant to show it,

97
00:04:30,436 --> 00:04:33,439
- just because it can look strange.
- [Elise] Yeah.

98
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,650
But I think it's time
for the world to see.

99
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:38,569
[woman sighing]

100
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,280
You look like a Svengali,

101
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:41,906
- puppeteer master.
- Yeah. Yeah.

102
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,201
What is objectively happening when you,

103
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:48,288
with your hands feet above a body...

104
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:49,789
- [John] Yeah.
- ...lift?

105
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:52,250
- What are you pulling on?
- [laughing]

106
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:53,835
What's happening?

107
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,962
You can measure the energy field
of the body,

108
00:04:56,045 --> 00:04:58,089
somewhere between
four and six feet off the body.

109
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,758
The body doesn't end right here
at the skin.

110
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,760
The body is multi-dimensional,

111
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,595
there are layers to it,

112
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,806
and I'm interacting with those layers.

113
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:10,560
So when I'm moving my hands in the air
and I'm snapping my fingers

114
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,478
and I'm making sounds with my hands,

115
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:16,441
I'm putting energy into the field
around somebody's body,

116
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:19,777
and I'm changing their energy system
just by the way I interact with it.

117
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,281
The way we interact with someone,
without even touching them,

118
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:26,743
at the subatomic level,
changes them in some way, shape or form.

119
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:29,954
- Aah! Sound.
- [moaning]

120
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,963
[John]
There's been some amazing research done

121
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,459
in the realm of quantum physics
to support this.

122
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:38,046
One foundational study
is called the double-slit experiment.

123
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,965
It proved empirically,
without a shadow of a doubt,

124
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:46,429
that our consciousness actually shifts
or alters in some way, shape or form,

125
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,722
physical reality.

126
00:06:03,446 --> 00:06:05,823
But there's also a physical component
of it.

127
00:06:05,907 --> 00:06:07,367
I'm touching the sacrum area

128
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:10,370
and the lower part of the neck
to generate the wave

129
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:11,930
- moving through the spine...
- [woman groaning]

130
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:13,674
to try to manipulate the flow
of information

131
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,792
between the brain,
nervous system and muscles.

132
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:20,421
This approach was actually developed
by a man named Donny Epstein

133
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:22,298
in an approach called Network Spinal.

134
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,425
I studied with him for many years.

135
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:25,968
We had a session,

136
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,804
we did a four-way,
like nothing's happening.

137
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:31,182
- It was a group session.
- Yeah, we had four tables going at once.

138
00:06:31,265 --> 00:06:32,534
- [Elise] It was three goopers,
- Yeah.

139
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,185
and Julianne Hough joined as our fourth.

140
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:39,190
You know, it was a really
just extreme somatic experience.

141
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:41,275
Why wasn't I invited to this shindig?

142
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:43,403
[Elise] Because you got
a one-on-one, princess.

143
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:45,238
[all laughing]

144
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:48,282
[telephone ringing]

145
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,827
Hi, thank you for calling goop.
Ayanna speaking.

146
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:56,624
Julianne, hello.

147
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:57,707
[Julianne Hough] Hello.

148
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:02,922
I have known Dr. John Amaral since 2013.

149
00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:06,717
This work is so transformative

150
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:10,054
that I just wanted to share my experience

151
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:12,306
with every single person that I could.

152
00:07:12,473 --> 00:07:14,350
And so, here we all are.

153
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:17,061
[John] All right, Brian,
is there anything going right now

154
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,439
that you think would be relevant
for me to know?

155
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:23,151
Yeah, just, you know,
kind of normal stresses of life.

156
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,821
I tend to just be a kind of uptight person
in general.

157
00:07:26,904 --> 00:07:30,741
I think everybody at goop knows me
to be a bit of a skeptic.

158
00:07:30,825 --> 00:07:33,077
I'm gonna be working
off the physical body,

159
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,413
- in the field of energy around your body.
- Mm-hmm.

160
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,458
The scientist in me wants
to question everything.

161
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,875
- [John] Hi, Janay.
- Hey.

162
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,418
I just wanna check in with you.

163
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,754
- I would say a lot of, like, chest pain.
- Okay.

164
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:46,340
Gets hard to sleep sometimes.

165
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:48,426
I have episodes of sleep paralysis.

166
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,678
It's a very scary experience.

167
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:54,223
It's like you can't move, you can't talk,
and you're kind of, like, stuck.

168
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:57,059
[John] Get comfortable there
and I'll be right back over.

169
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,980
- So, right, what's going on? Anything?
- [laughs]

170
00:08:01,063 --> 00:08:02,356
Just anxiety.

171
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,151
It's just been a really intense few weeks.

172
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,068
Okay.

173
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:09,489
I am anxious always, um...

174
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,116
which is sort of my...
one of my baselines in my life.

175
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,493
Go ahead and go face down.

176
00:08:14,202 --> 00:08:16,829
And I just want to, honestly, release.

177
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:20,249
[John] I'm gonna come a little bit
off the body here,

178
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:22,877
about three or four feet is where
there's the most access

179
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,129
in the field of energy around you,
right there.

180
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:29,425
You're... [exhales]

181
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:35,056
[sighs] It'll help that move through
that lower sacrum area.

182
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:39,101
Your physical body is held
in different patterns by so many factors.

183
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:42,939
A lot of people's emotional energy
gets bound up.

184
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:44,941
The tip of the tailbone will tuck under

185
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,276
when we feel, like, victimized
or traumatized.

186
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,487
So we can see that our emotional system

187
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,698
is like a fluid network
through the whole body,

188
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,867
it's not like emotion happens
in your head.

189
00:08:54,951 --> 00:08:57,203
It actually happens
in the sites on our body.

190
00:08:57,370 --> 00:08:58,913
And so, when I'm working on people

191
00:08:58,996 --> 00:09:02,333
and when energy starts moving
and they start releasing,

192
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,169
how emotion expresses
is through movement and sound.

193
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,587
[Julianne sighs]

194
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,172
[John] Right there.

195
00:09:08,839 --> 00:09:10,599
[Julianne] The first time
I worked with John,

196
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,469
I'll never forget this
because I'm a dancer.

197
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:17,431
I'm very connected to my body,
and my body just sort of took over.

198
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,893
There was this one moment last year

199
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:24,146
when John was actually working
around my foot,

200
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:25,690
and I got angry.

201
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:28,234
And then I just had such deep sadness.

202
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,611
And it was actually a memory that I had,

203
00:09:30,695 --> 00:09:33,698
and it was connected to a trauma
that happened to me when I was ten

204
00:09:33,781 --> 00:09:36,450
that I hadn't even thought of
for 20 years.

205
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:37,827
[exhales]

206
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:38,953
At ten years old,

207
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:42,373
my parents
went through a pretty aggressive divorce,

208
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:44,041
and I lived with my dance coaches.

209
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,461
It was not the best living situation,

210
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:51,924
and so I had this, like,
really just pissed-off anger,

211
00:09:52,008 --> 00:09:54,802
like, literally attached in my foot,
basically.

212
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,013
Oh!

213
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:00,641
This method works incredibly well for me

214
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:04,812
because it helps me experience
and go back to things

215
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:06,814
and be able to shift them.

216
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:09,150
Finish that stretch there.

217
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:14,488
Beautiful, Brian. Sweet.

218
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,407
Really nice.

219
00:10:17,325 --> 00:10:20,870
Here. We're gonna come off the body here,
out in the field. There you go.

220
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:22,639
What's happening when I'm working
with people

221
00:10:22,663 --> 00:10:27,501
is that they're feeling
intense experiences and feelings,

222
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,337
- that whole emotional range,
- Right.

223
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,255
from absolute sensitivity
and vulnerability

224
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:34,634
to the range of absolute frustration,
anger and despair.

225
00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:35,843
[inhaling]

226
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:38,179
- [John] Hello, Janay.
- Hi.

227
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,811
[John] There's that area
right behind your heart.

228
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:47,313
And imagine this kind of funnel of energy

229
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,756
going from the back of your heart,

230
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,609
all the way through the front,
shooting out the front.

231
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:52,610
[Janay exhales]

232
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:55,112
Yeah. Good. Beautiful.

233
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,786
Yeah, that's coming
right through your heart now.

234
00:11:01,869 --> 00:11:05,206
Now, just let that out with a little...
[exhales]

235
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:16,926
[Elise] Janay, who had
a very emotional experience with you,

236
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,886
quiet, not a lot of movement,
but emotional.

237
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,889
[Janay] I'm not a big crier.

238
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:25,935
But I'm somebody who keeps a lot
of their emotions close to their chest.

239
00:11:26,727 --> 00:11:29,939
I fell into, like, a deep meditative state

240
00:11:30,564 --> 00:11:32,233
and then it kind of intensified.

241
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:35,194
I was, like,
playing everything back in my life.

242
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,863
It was a way to express myself
and let things go,

243
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:41,033
that I was holding onto for, I think,
a really, really long time.

244
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:44,286
She felt all this density
and pressure in her heart,

245
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,622
and she felt physical tension
in her heart.

246
00:11:46,706 --> 00:11:49,041
- That's actually sadness or grief.
- Yeah.

247
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:57,216
When I first met John,
there was a woman on the table.

248
00:11:57,299 --> 00:12:00,678
She was screaming,

249
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:03,973
and her body was just kind of,
you know, moving.

250
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:08,477
And I immediately thought,
"Wow, what's... what's wrong with her?"

251
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:12,732
You know, "Woo-woo," you know,
"bullshit, not true.

252
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:15,943
Just, you know,
a bunch of privileged people in LA."

253
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,863
But, you know, at the same time,
I was curious.

254
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,198
[laughs]
I wanted to get on the table myself.

255
00:12:21,782 --> 00:12:25,536
During the time that I met John,
I was living with massive pain.

256
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:28,372
I had migraines and depression.

257
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,167
The first time I got on the table
with John,

258
00:12:31,542 --> 00:12:35,796
I started to sob uncontrollably.

259
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:41,093
Memories started coming up
of my childhood, growing up.

260
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:44,263
I grew up where food was a scarcity.

261
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,474
Um, there was a lot of abuse,

262
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:52,146
and at the time,
I was so ashamed of my childhood,

263
00:12:52,229 --> 00:12:55,733
and I was so ashamed of,
quote, unquote "where I came from."

264
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:58,360
And the session on the table,

265
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,572
it was almost like this release

266
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:04,408
of... [sighs] what I had been holding in.

267
00:13:04,492 --> 00:13:09,205
I left with this
completely different perspective.

268
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,499
Fast forward to now,

269
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:16,086
I feel this overwhelming peace
and calmness,

270
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:20,466
and every single cell in my body

271
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:23,135
knows it and feels it.

272
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,471
[Gwyneth] Dr. Lekkos, do you believe that

273
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:28,015
- there is a correlation between
- Yeah.

274
00:13:28,098 --> 00:13:30,559
what's happened to you
and different traumas,

275
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:34,021
to how it's showing up in the body
and expressing the symptom?

276
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:36,440
It's almost like a memory gets stored
in your brain

277
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,151
or the emotion sometimes will store
in your body.

278
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,278
- Like molecules of emotion?
- [John] Yes.

279
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:44,114
I've had the privilege to work
with a body worker here in LA,

280
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,866
pushing on people's thighs

281
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:49,286
and grown men starting to cry
like babies and memories coming out.

282
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:52,623
So, we're seeing how emotional pain
gets stored in our cells.

283
00:14:06,929 --> 00:14:08,639
[John] There are researchers, PhDs,

284
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:11,392
looking at the science behind
the human energy field

285
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:12,935
and people like you, Dr. Lekkos,

286
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,146
- are actually open to exploring.
- [Lekkos] Exactly.

287
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,233
I don't think the technology's quite there
to measure energy healing,

288
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:21,837
but just 'cause something isn't proven,
doesn't mean it doesn't work.

289
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,864
Look what he's doing
and other people who do what you do,

290
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,782
- they're helping people get better.
- Yeah.

291
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:30,160
[John inhaling, exhaling]

292
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:38,168
Come over to you, Elise. Here...

293
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:42,381
I'm gonna actually come off your body
quite a ways,

294
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:45,092
just because this is where
it's most receptive to you out here.

295
00:14:45,175 --> 00:14:46,051
[Elise groaning]

296
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:49,430
And energy move
right through here, up...

297
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,101
and there.

298
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:57,396
Doing amazing
letting the sound come through.

299
00:14:57,563 --> 00:15:00,357
[Elise grunts]
I have to get it to release.

300
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:01,734
- [John] Yes.
- [coughs]

301
00:15:02,318 --> 00:15:04,069
Sound is hard, you know.

302
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:06,238
I don't even know if I could scream
into a pillow.

303
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,615
- [John] Hmm.
- Really?

304
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,533
I don't know that
I'm unlike a lot of women.

305
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:11,285
I feel like it's hard.

306
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:14,496
Culturally, we so suppress sound

307
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,248
and the expression of weird sounds.

308
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,812
We don't want to make weird sounds,
because then we'd be weird.

309
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:21,754
And so a lot of people's anxiety,
a lot of people's stress,

310
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,589
it's not expressing as emotion,

311
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:26,383
it's not actually coming out
as the movement and sound.

312
00:15:26,467 --> 00:15:29,094
It's like contorting yourself
or lowering your standards

313
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:32,222
to make other people comfortable,
trying to be perfect,

314
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:34,284
- doing things you should do.
- So, just being a woman, basically?

315
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,308
[John] Right, totally.

316
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:38,687
Just gonna draw the energy
up through the front of your solar plexus,

317
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:41,690
your heart, your chest, your throat.
There you go right there.

318
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:45,778
When you've worked on thousands of people,
you start to see patterns.

319
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,422
This pattern usually shows up for people

320
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,907
that have all these roles
and responsibilities and duties,

321
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,450
and they torque themselves up.

322
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,327
[Elise] Is my body in half?

323
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,663
Feels like I'm bending in half.

324
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:57,873
Yeah, well your... your whole...

325
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:02,252
Yeah, your whole sacrum, lower spine
is raising up right there.

326
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,797
- I had an exorcism.
- [laughing]

327
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,591
[John] Further from the body.

328
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,303
[Elise groaning]

329
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:14,598
Okay, let your neck rock back
into extension.

330
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,183
Let this come up through.

331
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:19,395
And it felt like I was being, like,
pulled by a rope.

332
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:22,022
[Elise humming]

333
00:16:23,732 --> 00:16:26,235
[laughs] It was very painful, actually.

334
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:30,239
[groans, coughing]

335
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:34,535
And then he just snapped his fingers
and I just started retching.

336
00:16:35,119 --> 00:16:37,246
[coughs]

337
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:39,289
I dry heaved for a while.

338
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,207
[moaning]

339
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,918
Could you, like, get any goop-ier?

340
00:16:43,002 --> 00:16:45,462
- [laughing]
- I could not get any goop-ier.

341
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:47,256
- [moans]
- [both laugh]

342
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,842
- Now people are gonna think I'm a witch.
- Yeah.

343
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,301
She's goop-ier than I am.

344
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:54,805
Yeah.
It feels amazing when you get the release.

345
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:58,100
[chuckling] But I pray that it looks

346
00:16:58,183 --> 00:17:01,020
less crazy than it feels,

347
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,439
because I felt like I was standing
on my head

348
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,691
at points during that session.

349
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:07,776
[moaning]

350
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,738
When you've had the work,
what has it felt like for you?

351
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,281
Um... [sighs]

352
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:16,118
Well, the first time that John worked
on me,

353
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:19,079
I really just cried pretty much
the whole time.

354
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:23,333
So, for me,
I felt like John was just helping me

355
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:26,045
- sort of metabolize a whole lot of stuff.
- [John] Hmm.

356
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,881
As an actor, you're embodying these
different experiences,

357
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:31,633
like putting yourself
into a certain energy,

358
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,053
you're building up, like, an architecture,
an armory.

359
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:36,722
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I think everybody
does it differently.

360
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:40,142
For me, it is a very energetic experience.

361
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,519
But how do you preserve your energy?

362
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,522
Like, how do you keep it clean and strong?

363
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,608
I see John as much as I can,

364
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:50,819
- but he's busier than I am, almost.
- [laughing]

365
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:54,073
All right, so what's going on
for you right now?

366
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,118
Um... I'm just...
I'm really, really tired.

367
00:17:58,827 --> 00:18:03,248
Um, it's been a really stressful
couple of weeks of just work.

368
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:06,668
I feel like all the energy's
just zapped out of my body.

369
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:09,630
Well, I'm glad that we're
doing this session.

370
00:18:09,713 --> 00:18:10,631
- Me too.
- [both laugh]

371
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:13,550
So, we'll get your body out
of the go, go, go, stress mode

372
00:18:13,634 --> 00:18:17,137
and get it into the parasympathetic,
rest and relaxed.

373
00:18:17,221 --> 00:18:19,348
I'm gonna have you go
face down on the table.

374
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,431
Okay.

375
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,068
- [John exhales]
- [Gwyneth sighs]

376
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:38,200
[John]
We're starting to get some energy moving.

377
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,875
[exhaling]

378
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:52,548
[Gwyneth] I noticed when you work on me,
my nervous system, it'll sort of spasm,

379
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:56,593
especially places where I've had injury.

380
00:18:56,677 --> 00:19:00,180
Like, I had an emergency cesarean
with my daughter,

381
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,516
after being in labor for three days.

382
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:03,892
- It's not a good story.
- Yeah.

383
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:08,814
Um... but the cesarean scar
is really still...

384
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:12,818
I wouldn't say...
It's more emotionally painful to me.

385
00:19:12,901 --> 00:19:17,322
It doesn't feel like physical pain,
but I feel it as like this wound, still.

386
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,744
When our bodies are cut into,

387
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:28,292
we don't think about, like, the energetic
kind of planes that we're rupturing.

388
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,543
In my experience,

389
00:19:30,586 --> 00:19:34,548
it's more difficult to heal
on the energetic level than the skin,

390
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:38,010
which heals, knits together very quickly,
but for me anyway,

391
00:19:38,093 --> 00:19:42,639
those interventions really have stayed
with me and need care.

392
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,854
[John] Yeah, that's such
a well-articulated thought there.

393
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,940
I'm a true believer that the fascia,
the connective tissue,

394
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,693
that when you have a C-section
or when you have a surgery

395
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:58,572
or you have an injury
that injures those fascia tissues,

396
00:19:58,906 --> 00:20:01,992
they actually are made up
collagen fibers,

397
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,786
and they transfer energy through them,

398
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,496
like a fiber optic cable, almost.

399
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,832
- [Gwyneth] Right.
- It's considered a liquid crystal,

400
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,002
which is like when you touch,
like, an LCD screen,

401
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:15,839
you see the little ripples come out.
That's how energy goes through the...

402
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:17,924
It's like a whole...

403
00:20:17,966 --> 00:20:20,969
And it's so weird, it just looks
like Saran Wrap or something,

404
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:24,306
and it holds all
of this incredible information.

405
00:20:24,389 --> 00:20:27,935
But it's totally dismissed
by most conventional doctors, right?

406
00:20:28,018 --> 00:20:30,562
They're like,
"Fuck fascia, it's connective tissue."

407
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:33,774
Probably one of the well-known researchers
in this area, James Oschman,

408
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:34,983
has done incredible work

409
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:38,904
around the science of how fascia
and connective tissue

410
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:41,823
is a whole matrix of which
consciousness is expressed.

411
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:44,159
We're coming up against
some limitations

412
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,453
of the matter-to-matter kind of healing,

413
00:20:46,536 --> 00:20:48,497
where you do physical
to work on the physical.

414
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:50,916
But sometimes people need
to have surgery,

415
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,626
- and you can't avoid it.
- [Elise] Yeah.

416
00:20:52,709 --> 00:20:56,505
I just want to use all the tools we have
and all the modalities and work together

417
00:20:56,588 --> 00:20:58,708
- to help people on this path.
<i>- </i>That's exactly right.

418
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,636
[John] I had follicular B-cell lymphoma,

419
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:06,431
which was creating numbness
from the chest down.

420
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:08,642
I was unstable. I couldn't run.

421
00:21:09,601 --> 00:21:11,241
The great thing is it's a curable cancer.

422
00:21:11,311 --> 00:21:14,314
What they didn't know was
what would happen with the numbness.

423
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:17,651
They're like, "You know, you might
never get that feeling back."

424
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:21,363
And I was like,
"No, I'm going to get that feeling back."

425
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,366
I've heard of John's work
through other people,

426
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,701
through more word of mouth.

427
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:27,703
I didn't get on the tables at first

428
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,705
and I sit back, watching
and I'm thinking,

429
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:33,750
"Okay... uh, this is interesting."

430
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:35,711
And then we actually
did a session that night.

431
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:36,920
He didn't even touch me.

432
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:40,632
In that particular session,
my back was starting to, you know,

433
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:43,802
kind of crack, crack, crack, crack,
and he was not touching me.

434
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:47,639
Which I found super,
and I go, "What is going on, John?"

435
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:51,143
He goes, "Your body's just kind of
moving itself where it needs to go."

436
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,854
You know, after four
or five sessions with John,

437
00:21:53,937 --> 00:21:56,648
I could feel the energy flowing up
and down my spinal column.

438
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,693
And I'm happy to say,
I'm able to run again.

439
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:01,653
[laughs] So, that's cool.

440
00:22:02,612 --> 00:22:04,740
- Turn your head to the left.
- Okay.

441
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,303
Okay, great, then back to the middle.

442
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:09,995
After the session, we had Janay come in,
and she laid on the table.

443
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,539
And he's trying to teach me how
to treat people like this.

444
00:22:12,622 --> 00:22:14,249
Why don't you come around this side

445
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,917
and I'll just show you...

446
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,046
We're gonna start in her sacrum area.

447
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:23,050
If you touch right here, very gently,

448
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,345
you'll feel an area
where it's more receptive,

449
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,708
- It's almost like...
- A sponge.

450
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,182
It kind of of draws you in, it's softer.

451
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:32,642
So he had me put my hand on her back,

452
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:35,228
and I closed my eyes
and was kind of concentrating

453
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:39,024
and trying to feel or open
my consciousness into what's going on...

454
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:43,695
There's really a lot of energy
flowing right in this one little point.

455
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:47,866
Lighten your touch up and ask her,
in a way, her body to just open.

456
00:22:48,909 --> 00:22:49,910
Right there.

457
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:52,454
And that's where
that opens this dimension up

458
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:55,040
between energy and the physical

459
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:57,459
- and you go into, like, a space...
- Yeah.

460
00:22:57,542 --> 00:23:01,546
and that space is where things
can really start flowing.

461
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,425
[Lekkos]
And I felt my hand go inside of her body,

462
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:06,510
it went down.

463
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:09,805
Even though I knew my hand was still,
but I felt it go down

464
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:11,574
- and then up again.
- [Gwyneth] Oh, my gosh.

465
00:23:11,598 --> 00:23:13,725
[Lekkos] And then down, but with her
respirations,

466
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,602
I could feel it go really deep.

467
00:23:15,727 --> 00:23:17,854
So, I was like,
"Maybe this is some kind of...

468
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,483
I'm playing a trick on myself."
I was like, "Let's try it somewhere else."

469
00:23:21,566 --> 00:23:23,318
Come right into like...

470
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,546
You're looking for that same feeling.
Like, right here.

471
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,446
[Lekkos] Mm-hmm.

472
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:31,076
We're gonna send that

473
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,994
and direct it, actually, up.

474
00:23:34,162 --> 00:23:37,916
Tell me when you feel it at that end start
to move a little bit.

475
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,085
There.

476
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,045
The same thing.

477
00:23:42,129 --> 00:23:44,714
My hand goes inside of her head,
outside of her head,

478
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,007
inside, outside.

479
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,885
And that was really awesome.
I'm like, "John, what is happening?"

480
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,887
It's like you're feeling
another dimension.

481
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,722
You're on another plane.

482
00:23:52,806 --> 00:23:55,308
It's not a physical touching thing,
it's really interesting.

483
00:23:55,392 --> 00:23:59,146
We used to take a phone book
in chiropractic college,

484
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:02,691
and we would put, like,
a little needle under some pages

485
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,818
and then we would put more pages...

486
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:06,027
And pretty soon, by the end,

487
00:24:06,111 --> 00:24:08,113
you could feel the needle
through the whole book.

488
00:24:09,531 --> 00:24:12,534
You're training your receptors
to pick up information

489
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,286
rather than try to go down through it.

490
00:24:14,369 --> 00:24:17,122
And that's key
to having this kind of response happen

491
00:24:17,205 --> 00:24:19,332
is being able to receive that information.

492
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,813
- How do you explain that?
- [Lekkos] I don't know.

493
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:26,006
That's what I'm saying,
you can't measure this stuff.

494
00:24:26,089 --> 00:24:29,217
So, Janay, do you notice,
when we're doing this off your body,

495
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:30,621
do you notice something going on?

496
00:24:30,677 --> 00:24:34,431
- I feel like I melt into the table.
- [laughs] Yes.

497
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:38,059
Janay woke up in the middle of the night
and purged for an hour.

498
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:39,394
- Really?
- Yeah.

499
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:42,772
She threw up from three a.m. to four a.m.

500
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:44,900
[John] Her body went out
of flight or fight.

501
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:48,778
It went into relaxation
and the parasympathetic nervous system,

502
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:51,114
which is in charge of resting
and digesting

503
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,200
and healing and detoxing, kicked in.

504
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,160
So, it's not surprising
that later that night

505
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:57,704
her body was continuing to purge
because emotions,

506
00:24:57,787 --> 00:25:00,957
if you can't move it through
as waves and sounds and vibrations,

507
00:25:01,041 --> 00:25:04,628
then you hold it as physical tension.
So, there's this loop.

508
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:06,421
The first time, I also kind of bar...

509
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:08,715
- Not barfed, but I thought I was gonna.
- [laughing]

510
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:10,800
I think you said it was an energetic...

511
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,093
- [Gwyneth] Barf.
- Yeah.

512
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,763
Nothing came out,
but it felt as if I was throwing up.

513
00:25:15,347 --> 00:25:18,058
It was like the slate
had just been cleaned, you know?

514
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:21,645
And I think afterwards,
I felt incredibly, deeply...

515
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:24,021
peaceful.

516
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,901
[John]
All right, Gwyneth, come on up sitting.

517
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,736
[groans]

518
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,493
[John chuckles] How you feeling?

519
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,913
I feel like I could sleep for, like...

520
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:43,166
I feel like I could go to bed
for the whole night right now.

521
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,292
- [John] Yeah.
- [inhales]

522
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,963
[sighs] But I feel much better.

523
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,714
Your body needs sleep.

524
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:54,886
But give it about, like, ten or 15 minutes
and you'll start to come back up,

525
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:56,650
'cause you just went
to a really deep place

526
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,599
- where it will recharge and reset.
- Yeah.

527
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:01,059
[woman] One more, inhale.

528
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,312
[inhaling]

529
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:06,773
Fold forward. Release.

530
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:10,652
This is the century where
we're gonna have massive upgrades

531
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:14,406
in how we view energy,
human energy, the human energy field.

532
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:16,491
[woman] Inhale, warrior two.

533
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,451
[Lekkos] Are simple things
that everyone can do

534
00:26:18,577 --> 00:26:20,537
to try to get energy flowing better?

535
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,872
[woman] Exhale. Reverse your warrior.

536
00:26:23,456 --> 00:26:26,793
We can use our hands almost like
a stethoscope to feel ourselves.

537
00:26:27,377 --> 00:26:28,897
[woman] Take one last inhale together.

538
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:32,966
What's there just needs a...
[inhales, exhales]

539
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,135
[woman] Exhale. Down dog.

540
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:37,596
[Gwyneth] I do that all the time now.

541
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:41,600
So if I feel anxious or I'm at my desk

542
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:43,310
and I start to feel like out of body,

543
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:46,021
I put my hands, like throat and heart,

544
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:49,441
and I just, I'm like, "Oh, wow,
there's a lot going on in there."

545
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:52,902
And then, I just kind of breathe
and it's almost like bringing...

546
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:56,573
You said, "Bring some tenderness,
you know, through your hands to it."

547
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,366
[woman] Lay down on your back.

548
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,870
[Gwyneth] Anybody could sit at home

549
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:05,999
and kind of put their own hands
on the areas of their body

550
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:09,461
where they feel the most stuck
and just sit with it, just observe it.

551
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,504
[woman]
Namaste, guys. Thank you so much.

552
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:14,466
[Gwyneth]
So many of us walk around in our heads,

553
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:16,193
with our to-do lists
and what we have to do,

554
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:19,346
and the experience of being in our bodies

555
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,764
and integrated with our bodies

556
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:24,059
is not something a lot of us experience
all day, every day.

557
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:26,120
[Janay] The first time I worked with John,

558
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:30,023
it was, like, really trippy and crazy.

559
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:33,234
I could almost feel
where his hands were going to be

560
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,504
- [Janay] Yeah.
- without seeing them. It was really weird.

561
00:27:35,528 --> 00:27:38,615
My body was, like, waving and reacting.

562
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:42,160
The scientist in me wants to, like,
do some research,

563
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:45,163
ask some questions,
come up with, like, a hypothesis

564
00:27:45,246 --> 00:27:48,750
and then kind of rinse and repeat
and see if I do notice anything different.

565
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:53,963
But I think that the fact that I was able
to relax and quiet my mind,

566
00:27:54,047 --> 00:27:56,466
it was therapeutic for me in that sense.

567
00:27:56,966 --> 00:27:59,135
I feel very airy and grounded.

568
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,428
I've been sleeping like...

569
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:03,181
I'm not saying it may have fixed this...

570
00:28:03,264 --> 00:28:08,228
- but I have been sleeping a lot better.
- You have trouble sleeping, right?

571
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:11,189
Yeah, I usually have
sleep paralysis-like episodes.

572
00:28:11,272 --> 00:28:13,441
As we get more integrated
and more whole,

573
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,087
that means all the parts of us
that are hard to be with, the sad parts,

574
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:19,072
the scared parts, the helpless parts,
the parts that feel lonely,

575
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:20,949
the parts that feel like
we're not enough...

576
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,034
if we start to feel those
and be with them,

577
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,828
we can be fully accepting of them.

578
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,913
What happens is that those things
don't trigger us

579
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:28,248
in the world out there so much,

580
00:28:28,331 --> 00:28:30,250
and we can be with so much more

581
00:28:30,333 --> 00:28:32,502
of the range of human experience
and emotion

582
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:33,795
without getting triggered.

583
00:28:33,878 --> 00:28:35,755
[Janay] It was really crazy.

584
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:38,425
It seems pretty normal for a day
at goop now, don't you think?

585
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,508
[all laughing]

586
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:42,804
