1
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:08,883
When I started goop in 2008,

2
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:11,928
I was like, "My calling is something else
besides, you know,

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,472
making out with Matt Damon
on screen or whatever."

4
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:15,556
[laughs]

5
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,769
And now it's this modern lifestyle brand.

6
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:24,024
To me, it's all laddering up to one thing,
which is optimization of self.

7
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,192
Like, we're here one time, one life...

8
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,112
like, how can we really, like,
milk the shit out of this?

9
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,363
[laughing]

10
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,490
You have a hundred needles
in your face, Elise.

11
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,826
- Just another day at the office.
- [laughing]

12
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:36,953
The opportunity that we have
with the goop lab

13
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,665
is that, as a company,
we can go out in different groups

14
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,918
and go on a much deeper dive
into some of these topics

15
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,712
that our readers are curious about.

16
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:48,131
- [laughing]
- This is gonna be my first experience

17
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,442
- with mushrooms.
- [Gillian] Oh!

18
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,593
- [exhales]
- [woman] You have to let go of your ego.

19
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,112
[Gwyneth] So what happens in a workshop?

20
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,679
- Everyone gets off.
- [woman moaning]

21
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,848
What the fuck are you doing to people?

22
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,183
[man vocalizing]

23
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:02,103
We get to explore, like, is this real?
Do we feel better?

24
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:04,647
And grapple with some topics
that are hard

25
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:06,816
and embarrassing or shameful.

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,318
Isn't that beautiful?

27
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,611
- [exhales]
- [woman 2] Relax.

28
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:11,696
That was, like, next level shit.

29
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,908
So, are you guys ready
to go out in the field

30
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,701
- and make a ruckus?
- [Elise] Yeah.

31
00:01:16,785 --> 00:01:19,871
- You can handle it, right?
- [laughing]

32
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:36,012
[Laura Lynne Jackson]
Once you become aware of your own energy

33
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,764
and that everything around us is energy,

34
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:40,642
you can start to do exercises and activity

35
00:01:40,975 --> 00:01:44,145
that help open you up energetically.

36
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:48,858
When you open to all these abilities,
mediumship happens.

37
00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:52,821
Was there just something
with your car, getting a new car?

38
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:54,114
- Yeah.
- Okay.

39
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,740
That's... [scoffs]

40
00:01:55,824 --> 00:01:59,536
You're psychic, you're an intuitive,
you're a medium. We all are.

41
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:03,414
I could feel a vibration almost in my jaw.

42
00:02:03,498 --> 00:02:05,375
I kept hearing, like, "M" popping up.

43
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:06,876
Oh, my God.

44
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:08,837
This freaks me out.

45
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:12,006
[laughs] I know you're laughing already.

46
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:15,343
To me this whole...
this whole medium, psychic world

47
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,137
is very much like Santa Claus.

48
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,431
This whole group of people
are being categorized

49
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:22,058
as unethical and fraudulent.

50
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,019
Ideas are laughed at
before they're accepted, right?

51
00:02:25,103 --> 00:02:27,105
The world's flat, not round.

52
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,315
So, there's always this moment

53
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:32,152
of society being resistant
to understanding it.

54
00:02:32,235 --> 00:02:35,280
If we take a piece of paper,
we're on this side, they're right here.

55
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,323
They're right here with us all the time.

56
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:42,495
[sighs]

57
00:02:48,835 --> 00:02:50,420
It's so nice that you guys are here.

58
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:51,713
Thanks so much for having us.

59
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,631
- This is gonna be a good one.
- Mm-hmm.

60
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:57,343
Feel free to let us know any messages
from our deceased

61
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,345
- as we sit here.
- [laughing]

62
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:00,869
[Elise] So, Laura, we know you well.

63
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,976
You've probed both of our worlds
on the other side.

64
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,859
- Yes, yes.
- [Gwyneth] What is the difference

65
00:03:06,895 --> 00:03:08,855
between mediums and psychics?

66
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,482
Being a psychic means that I read energy

67
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:15,570
and being a medium means that I can
connect with the consciousness

68
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:18,239
of people who have
left their physical bodies

69
00:03:18,323 --> 00:03:19,616
and crossed to the other side.

70
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,035
I had had one experience
with a medium before,

71
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:25,038
and just... it hadn't resonated,

72
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:26,539
and I think I'm skeptical.

73
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:30,001
I'm like, "This is Google-able,
this is Google-able." You know?

74
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:31,729
Right, you're famous,
which is complicating.

75
00:03:31,753 --> 00:03:33,022
Right, so it really complicates,

76
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,673
'cause you can find out
pretty much anything about me.

77
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,175
But when I sat down with Laura,

78
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:40,845
she was saying things
that are not Google-able.

79
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:44,974
And she knew something
that my husband didn't even know.

80
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,685
And then I really thought,
"Wow, this is real."

81
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:48,645
Oh, yes.

82
00:03:48,728 --> 00:03:50,897
And, Julie, your research is fascinating.

83
00:03:51,022 --> 00:03:51,856
Thank you.

84
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:53,441
[Elise] Why is it so important?

85
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:57,195
What happens when we die is
that affects every single person.

86
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,154
Yeah.

87
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:01,699
And there's a lot of anecdotal evidence
that mediumship readings help with grief.

88
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:03,660
That's certainly been my case.

89
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:06,287
So there's tens, if not hundreds,
if not thousands,

90
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:08,915
if not millions of people in the US,
at least,

91
00:04:08,998 --> 00:04:11,751
who have these experiences
of communication with the deceased

92
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,212
and share their messages
that they receive with others.

93
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:16,297
And so, as a scientist, I thought,

94
00:04:16,381 --> 00:04:17,465
"There's something to this.

95
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:19,634
And our science really needs
to take a look at this."

96
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:36,693
So I know you read goop staffers.
The first was Caitlin.

97
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,486
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, what happened?

98
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,131
[Laura] So I'm just going to be quiet
for one moment.

99
00:04:41,155 --> 00:04:43,408
- Okay.
- We'll see what they have to say. Okay.

100
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:57,213
Okay, I do have a female figure coming in

101
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,340
on my upper right hand screen.

102
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:02,552
So that's Mom's side of the family,
it feels very motherly to me.

103
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:06,556
I'm trying to pull that through
a little bit more. Um...

104
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,640
[stammers]

105
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:10,435
- Don't feed me.
- Yeah.

106
00:05:10,518 --> 00:05:11,787
- Sorry. Sorry.
- Don't feed the medium.

107
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:13,896
- I'm trying...
- [laughing] Don't give me anything.

108
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,232
It's my job to work hard
to figure this out,

109
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:17,501
- is how I want to say it.
- Totally.

110
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:19,319
You know, like, that's how I get it.

111
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:22,030
But I'm hearing what sounds like an E-L,

112
00:05:22,113 --> 00:05:23,882
- or an "L" sounding name to me.
- [sobbing] Mm-hmm.

113
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:25,533
- Is that tied to Mom?
- Mm-hmm.

114
00:05:25,616 --> 00:05:27,201
Okay. It's like I want to hug you

115
00:05:27,285 --> 00:05:29,054
and be like,
"Baby, baby, I'm okay, I'm okay."

116
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,747
This is... she got you here,

117
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:33,458
and she's so thankful that
you're being so brave to be here.

118
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,420
Do you have artwork from your mom?

119
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,464
- Mm-hmm.
- Like, the real message I want to say,

120
00:05:39,547 --> 00:05:41,591
it's like when you walk in your home,

121
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,676
it's like, boom, you see it right away.

122
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:47,680
- Do you understand?
- Yeah. That's... [scoffs]

123
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:51,225
And the way she's saying it to me is like,
"That's my presence in your life.

124
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:54,354
I am right there every day, honey,
like this.

125
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:58,441
I've had readings before, so I didn't
anticipate getting so emotional.

126
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,109
I'm also hearing "Happy Birthday."

127
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,913
Is there a birthday coming up
in the family?

128
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,906
- [laughing] Hers.
- Okay, all right.

129
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:06,324
- It's tomorrow.
- Okay.

130
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:10,495
[Caitlin] But some of the stuff she said
was really specific,

131
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,247
so it was pretty intense.

132
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:17,543
So, how does the information come to you?

133
00:06:17,627 --> 00:06:20,463
In order to do the work that I do,

134
00:06:20,546 --> 00:06:24,467
I kind of have to forget that I exist,
in a way, and surrender.

135
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:28,721
So it's this clearing process
that I just become this vessel

136
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,473
for information to come through,

137
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:34,352
and then I get information on this screen
that goes on in my mind.

138
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,437
And it will first appear
as a point of light.

139
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,232
So, I'll have a general idea
of who I'm speaking with.

140
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,692
Your grandmother just steps through, too.

141
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,987
They're happy to be reunited,
is how I have to say it,

142
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:47,198
and they both come through
so loving to you.

143
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:50,952
Anybody on the sitter's mother's side
of the family

144
00:06:51,035 --> 00:06:52,675
is supposed to come in on my upper right.

145
00:06:52,829 --> 00:06:56,165
Anybody on the sitter's father's side
comes on my lower right,

146
00:06:56,499 --> 00:07:00,586
and then any extended family or friend
or friend of family comes in my middle.

147
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:03,107
Okay, I don't mean
to get too personal here

148
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:08,428
but she does show me two children
for you, waiting.

149
00:07:08,511 --> 00:07:10,138
That's how I want to say it.

150
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:14,016
I guess it's only fair that your mother
can nag you about having kids

151
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,519
- from someplace in the world.
- [laughing]

152
00:07:16,602 --> 00:07:18,604
From the other side,
which is really right here.

153
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:22,233
She tells me that she came here
as your mom,

154
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:24,026
but you were the more evolved soul

155
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,279
that taught her so many lessons
about love.

156
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,923
- [sniffling]
- I need to say it that way.

157
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:30,408
And she's thanking you
for agreeing to be her daughter.

158
00:07:30,783 --> 00:07:32,201
That's how I have to say it.

159
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:38,124
If you ask for signs and messages,

160
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:40,835
like, really specific concrete ones
from the other side,

161
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:41,919
you will get them.

162
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,214
You don't need a psychic medium
to prove it to you.

163
00:07:45,339 --> 00:07:47,383
So wait, are we all psychic?

164
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:50,720
[Laura] We can all do this,
and I think we all start out intuitive

165
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,430
and we develop our psychic abilities.

166
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:53,931
And my sense of it is,

167
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:56,058
as the more you open
and the more you develop,

168
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,561
it's almost like the higher you're able
to perceive

169
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:00,521
or the louder your volume switch is,

170
00:08:00,605 --> 00:08:04,066
and that kind of highest level
or that highest energy

171
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:08,821
is being able to perceive consciousness
in spirit form and be a receptor of that.

172
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,447
Wow.

173
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:31,469
I am so excited for us
to all explore energy today.

174
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,349
Okay. How many of you
have ever felt someone staring at you

175
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:38,601
and turned and were like,
"Oh, there's that person"?

176
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:41,812
Okay, that's a sense of directing energy
at somebody.

177
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:45,066
Energy is real, and there can be
a positive energy exchange

178
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,317
and a negative one.

179
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,611
Now we're about to
play around a little bit

180
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:51,989
with directing energy at one another.

181
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,384
[Micere] I'm here to take
Laura Lynne Jackson's workshop.

182
00:08:54,408 --> 00:08:57,828
I've worked with a lot of intuitives
and healers for the site at goop.

183
00:08:58,287 --> 00:09:01,374
And she's one of the best mediums
in the world, so it's very cool.

184
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:04,460
[Laura] One person will be
in the center of the circle,

185
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:08,422
and we will strike whatever pose
we feel pulled to

186
00:09:08,506 --> 00:09:11,384
to purposely
beam unconditional love

187
00:09:11,467 --> 00:09:12,927
to the person in the center.

188
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:17,848
Intuition is a mystery to me.
I'm feeling pretty open-minded about it,

189
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,643
but a little unsure of what the outcome's
gonna be.

190
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,854
The person in the center
is just gonna be the receiver.

191
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,399
I'm here today because I've always dabbled

192
00:09:26,482 --> 00:09:30,361
in the medium curiosity, if you will.

193
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:34,156
I think it's totally real,
something that you can explore,

194
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,743
and I wanted to touch on it
and see what it was all about.

195
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:41,789
And I'm sure some of you are
already hearing that rational part

196
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:45,626
of your brain saying, "Energy, what?
None of this stuff's gonna work!"

197
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,796
Just trust it and be open
and see what you experience,

198
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:50,673
'cause you really
might surprise yourself.

199
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:54,468
Who would like to volunteer
to be the first one to be beamed?

200
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:56,804
Ana should do it.

201
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:59,223
I think it should be Ana, too. Yeah.

202
00:09:59,307 --> 00:10:00,993
- Let's attack her with energy.
- Let's beam you, girl.

203
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:02,018
- Let's do it.
- For real?

204
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,079
- [man] "Beam me up."
- [woman] I'll beam you up, Ana.

205
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:07,148
- [laughing]
- I don't really believe

206
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:08,316
in mediums or psychics.

207
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,986
Either I'm ignorant and I've never been,
like, educated enough on it...

208
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:15,156
[laughing] I'm, like, about to be tarred
and feathered right now.

209
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:18,034
...or it's just something that people want
to believe in

210
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,910
because it makes them happy and feel good.

211
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:25,041
All right,
so everybody get ready and beam.

212
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,668
- [slow-tempo music playing]
- [birds chirping]

213
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:53,819
[Laura]
Okay, and you can drop your hands.

214
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:59,241
Did you feel a receiving of energy?

215
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,870
As soon as I stepped in the middle

216
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,413
and everyone put their hands up,

217
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,832
I felt supported.

218
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,793
I literally felt like
I was holding you up.

219
00:11:08,876 --> 00:11:09,752
It was really weird.

220
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:10,937
- [woman] Levitating you.
- [Laura] Me too.

221
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:13,589
Because I could feel...
I felt like we were lifting her up.

222
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:17,551
[laughs] Yeah, I felt like, I was like,
"Am I, like, off the ground?"

223
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:20,805
Behind my eyelids,
it got brighter and brighter and brighter.

224
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,599
I just felt, like,
a sense of peacefulness.

225
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,227
The energy I felt was above me.

226
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:31,357
I also felt like I was standing
on almost, like, a hilltop.

227
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,126
[Micere]
When you're in the center of the circle

228
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,194
and you feel everyone
sending their energy to you,

229
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:37,279
it's just a very loving presence

230
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,825
to have all that non-judgmental attention
put on you.

231
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:45,538
I don't know, I feel some sort of, like,
guilt for not feeling any of these ways.

232
00:11:45,621 --> 00:11:48,124
- I'm being honest.
- [laughing]

233
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:49,834
I just don't feel...

234
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:55,089
I don't feel like I can sympathize
with anything anybody said.

235
00:11:55,840 --> 00:12:00,177
So, our work is gonna try
to get you to feel something

236
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:03,431
and that's really it, you know?
And that's okay.

237
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,600
You can start from a place
where you're like, "I've got nothing.

238
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:09,228
I don't know what these other people
are talking about.

239
00:12:09,311 --> 00:12:10,521
How do you feel this?"

240
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:13,691
That can be a totally great place
to start from.

241
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:18,654
All I ask of you today is
to just be open to trying.

242
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:23,117
[Elise] The whole concept
of psychic mediumship

243
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:27,788
and intuition is unproven,
so it feels silly to believe in it.

244
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,540
Can we prove anything?

245
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,919
I've developed a quintuple blind protocol,
so it's five levels of blinding.

246
00:12:34,003 --> 00:12:35,296
So there's five people involved.

247
00:12:35,379 --> 00:12:37,923
and they're all blinded
to different pieces of information,

248
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:40,009
so there can't be any sensory leakage.

249
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,970
We'd call you "the sitter,"
the living person wanting to hear from.

250
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:45,181
So the medium doesn't know anything
about the sitter

251
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,265
or the deceased person.

252
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:48,100
They have no prior information.

253
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,727
No visual of the person?

254
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:54,732
No. When the reading takes place,
it's the medium and me on the phone

255
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:58,152
and all either of us have
is the first name of a deceased person.

256
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,862
And then we do that twice

257
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:03,157
and then we give you, the sitter,
both readings.

258
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,576
One is for somebody else's
deceased person,

259
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,704
so you're blinded to which one is yours
when you do the scoring.

260
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:10,080
- Oh, that's pretty cool.
- Hmm.

261
00:13:10,164 --> 00:13:12,708
There's no way anyone can, um, leak...

262
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,294
- unintentionally sensory information.
- [Gwyneth] Right.

263
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:17,797
And then it needs to be
exceptionally accurate

264
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:20,299
for the person who's passed that she knows

265
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,594
and exceptionally inaccurate
for the person not connected to her?

266
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:24,677
[Julie] Right.

267
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:29,600
Presumably, there are people
who maybe aren't as good at it,

268
00:13:29,683 --> 00:13:31,060
I'm not going to say fraudulent,

269
00:13:31,143 --> 00:13:33,437
but the way in any profession
there are people who are...

270
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:35,105
- [Julie] It's unregulated.
- Right.

271
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:36,649
- Yeah.
- You know I'm always saying,

272
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,360
sign me up for whatever research you want.
I'm game.

273
00:13:39,443 --> 00:13:43,197
I want to bring these messages through,
and I want people to help understand this.

274
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:12,142
Using this quintuple blind protocol,
we have shown that mediums

275
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,103
can report accurate
and specific information

276
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,226
about deceased people
when they aren't using fraud.

277
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:19,859
They aren't using cold reading
or Googling someone beforehand.

278
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,253
So we can show that certain mediums

279
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:23,821
- can do that, statistically speaking.
- That's so crazy.

280
00:14:24,238 --> 00:14:26,907
I feel like the quality of your readings
is so interesting, too,

281
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,118
because it's not cold hard facts.

282
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:33,122
It's like inside jokes, random stories...

283
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:34,081
Yeah.

284
00:14:34,164 --> 00:14:37,418
- Minutiae.
- Which is why other people can't gauge

285
00:14:37,501 --> 00:14:39,295
whether you got a good reading or not.

286
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:40,838
We often get people saying,

287
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,983
"You should release the transcripts
of the readings."

288
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,967
That's like releasing transcripts
of your therapy,

289
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:46,594
like, someone else can't decide.

290
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:49,096
The only person that can decide
if it was a good reading

291
00:14:49,179 --> 00:14:52,182
is the sitter,
for who the messages were for.

292
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:53,350
- Totally.
- [Julie] Yeah.

293
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:56,770
So what else do you teach?
What did you take them through?

294
00:14:56,854 --> 00:15:00,190
We did some activities to help open up
what I call "the four clairs."

295
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,992
We started on doing some exercises
to feel their own energy.

296
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,744
This kind of aura field around us.

297
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:14,455
And so we started
by drawing the colors we saw.

298
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:16,373
- That's nuts.
- [Laura] So amazing.

299
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:19,137
[Shaun] That went into more like
a yellow tone around her shoulders.

300
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,585
That's cool.

301
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:24,298
And her whole lower body was pink as well.

302
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,343
And then we worked with clairvoyance,
which is "clear-seeing,"

303
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:30,804
and it's, you know, your mind's eye,
looking without looking.

304
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:31,972
Oh, wow!

305
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,893
[Laura] You are going to try
to see what is under this,

306
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,478
without seeing it.

307
00:15:37,561 --> 00:15:41,649
Everybody is like, "You're crazy.
I can't do this, that's not a real thing."

308
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,068
And I'm like, "Trust it and try it."

309
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,279
- [Dwi] Whoa!
- So weird.

310
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:50,866
Another activity we did
is something called psychometry.

311
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:54,495
The idea there is that
every single object holds energy.

312
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:55,412
Yeah.

313
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,457
By holding an object,
we can kind of tune into the energy of it,

314
00:15:58,666 --> 00:16:02,002
to use that as almost this cord or link
to the information that's there.

315
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,464
And we had some
extraordinary experiences happen.

316
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:06,632
[Gwyneth] So cool.

317
00:16:08,842 --> 00:16:10,928
[Laura] Psychic ability is reading energy.

318
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,347
We've been doing that all day.
We're doing it now.

319
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:17,434
Mediumship is receiving information

320
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:21,146
from consciousness that is no longer
attached to a physical body,

321
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,815
that has left the physical body.

322
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,900
I'm going to ask you to open up

323
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,404
and use your entire psychic toolbox here...

324
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,197
"the four clairs."

325
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:47,840
You and your partner will swap objects.

326
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:51,510
You could just hold it because what
you're doing is you're reading energy.

327
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:55,597
And I want you to record
any impressions you get from that.

328
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,060
Clairsentience is "clear feeling,"

329
00:17:00,144 --> 00:17:02,855
and that's the on that we're
really embracing

330
00:17:02,938 --> 00:17:05,149
when we try to feel energy of an object.

331
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,318
Now some of our volume switches
are probably at one,

332
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:11,572
and some are at ten,
and with time and practice,

333
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:13,699
you can learn how
to turn that up and down.

334
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:17,619
So you're gonna try to feel anything
and everything you can

335
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,121
from this object.

336
00:17:19,204 --> 00:17:22,166
When you open up all these abilities,

337
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:26,754
what happens sometimes is that you reach
such an highly open state

338
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:29,631
that mediumship happens.

339
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:31,967
Okay, who wants to go first?

340
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,053
I'll volunteer.

341
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,638
[Laura] Okay, what object did you get?

342
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,891
[Ana] Nate gave me a photo.

343
00:17:38,974 --> 00:17:40,894
[Laura] What was the photograph of?
Let's see it.

344
00:17:42,269 --> 00:17:43,771
It's me and my grandfather.

345
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:45,814
[Laura]
Okay, but we might not know that's you.

346
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:49,401
It's an elderly gentleman
with a little kid standing on a table.

347
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,819
[laughing]

348
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:53,155
Okay. Do you know anything
about his grandfather?

349
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:55,550
His name, his personality, anything
like that prior to seeing the picture?

350
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,927
I don't know anything about Nate's family
besides his daughter.

351
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:59,220
- [Laura] Let's see what you got.
- [laughs]

352
00:17:59,244 --> 00:18:03,082
Okay. So I said that he was a loving man.

353
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:05,417
Um, I don't know why I wrote this,

354
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:07,920
but I wrote that he might have
loved chicken.

355
00:18:08,921 --> 00:18:12,049
- [Ana] Um...
- [laughter]

356
00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:15,636
Is it, like, possible just
to not have this superpower?

357
00:18:15,719 --> 00:18:16,553
[laughs]

358
00:18:16,637 --> 00:18:20,182
[Laura] It's possible to be very much
stuck in your frontal lobe

359
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,767
and to be so distanced from it

360
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,104
that you feel like,
"I can't possibly have this

361
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:26,456
and this isn't real in the world."

362
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,626
- Unless you have your own experiences...
- But everybody can't have this, right?

363
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:32,236
We're all born hardwired to each other
and the other side.

364
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,446
This is a gift that belongs to all of us,

365
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,533
but some of us train ourselves
so much out of it

366
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,119
that we don't honor it,
we don't engage in it.

367
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,912
So just stay open to it.

368
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:44,248
- It's great to...
- I'm open, I'm just waiting...

369
00:18:44,331 --> 00:18:45,916
I'm waiting for the superpower.

370
00:18:45,999 --> 00:18:48,353
- That's why I'm here, yeah.
- And honestly, I would say for you,

371
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,587
don't buy into it until you
have your own experience,

372
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,398
and it becomes your truth,
and then you're like,

373
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:54,342
"All right, I surrender,
I have to own this now."

374
00:18:54,424 --> 00:18:55,843
And until you do, don't.

375
00:18:57,094 --> 00:19:01,682
I get really scared of my, uh,
intuition sometimes.

376
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:05,435
Before I had children,
I was much more comfortable with it,

377
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,772
and then my "mother psychosis"

378
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,025
feels sometimes like a premonition,

379
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:15,362
and it's so terrifying to me.

380
00:19:15,445 --> 00:19:17,445
I've been like, "Oh, my God,
this is a premonition,

381
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:18,675
something bad's gonna happen."

382
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,410
I have a way to help with that,
because I'm in the same boat as you.

383
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,162
I have three children and believe me,

384
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:26,206
I do get psychic things for them,
but what I have learned

385
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:31,211
is when I get information intuitively
for family members, for my kids,

386
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,630
for my role in the world helping others,

387
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,716
it come through with absolutely

388
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:37,152
- no emotion attached.
- [Gwyneth] Right.

389
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:40,179
But if it's fear,
then it's your imagination, right?

390
00:19:40,262 --> 00:19:42,181
- [Laura] Then you're projecting it in.
- Right.

391
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:46,810
Can you share what you got?

392
00:19:46,894 --> 00:19:48,830
- Yeah, so I don't know why...
- What the object was...

393
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,939
[Kelly] It's this awesome dog.

394
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:53,150
For some reason,
I feel like this was given to you

395
00:19:53,233 --> 00:19:57,029
for a birthday, but it wasn't supposed
to be super sentimental,

396
00:19:57,112 --> 00:20:01,200
but that it, like, became sentimental
from losing what you lost,

397
00:20:01,283 --> 00:20:02,951
which I don't know exactly what that is.

398
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:07,831
Um, and it also felt like
a very sisterly relationship,

399
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:12,711
and it was something that was, like,
totally sudden and unavoidable.

400
00:20:13,086 --> 00:20:14,796
Uh, you know, your loss,

401
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,508
it felt very like, kind of like, "What?"

402
00:20:18,842 --> 00:20:22,262
Like, very out of left field. [exhales]

403
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,432
And something with an "M." I don't know.

404
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:27,351
I kept hearing, like, "M" popping up.

405
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:30,020
So I don't know if that's, like, a name,
or a city,

406
00:20:30,103 --> 00:20:33,148
or, like, something with an "M."

407
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:35,234
And I pictured someone
in their, like, 20s,

408
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:38,028
and there was something to me, like,
either breathing

409
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:40,530
or allergies or something,

410
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,575
like along, like, a...

411
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,203
I don't know.
Some allergy for some reason?

412
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:47,347
[Laura] What's interesting,

413
00:20:47,371 --> 00:20:51,166
this picture you're tying
to some loss that happened

414
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,794
that you're saying was sudden
and unavoidable and all of this.

415
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,855
And you've tied it to this picture.
That's interesting.

416
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:58,423
You got a picture,
and yet you tied it to an event

417
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:01,009
and a relationship
and so that's very interesting.

418
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:02,302
So can you share?

419
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,556
- So the "M," that dog's name is Muffin.
- [Kelly] Hmm.

420
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,725
[Dwi] That's her name. Um...

421
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,770
Why, there is, like, the sister.

422
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:16,608
My brother, who passed away,
gave that to my sister.

423
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:24,408
And then you're saying, like, you know,
unavoidable or life happening,

424
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:26,243
and, like, sudden.

425
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:29,746
Those are all things
that describe his passing.

426
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:32,833
I don't spend time
with any of these people at work,

427
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:33,917
barely any time.

428
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,003
I see maybe a few of them in meetings,

429
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:38,922
Kelly, I've maybe been in two meetings
with her.

430
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,050
And he did paint that,
he was in his 20-somethings...

431
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:44,928
- Did I say that, too?
- Yeah, he was in his 20s.

432
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:48,849
Um, and it wasn't supposed
to be a serious gift.

433
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:52,311
It was just, like, a gift to her

434
00:21:52,394 --> 00:21:54,479
- because she loves the dog so much.
- [Kelly] Right.

435
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,939
Oh, my God.

436
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:59,401
I was like, "Wow,"
like, physically taken aback.

437
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,070
[Shaun] I mean, Miss Medium over there.

438
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,756
[woman] Congratulations, Kelly,
you are a medium.

439
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,906
Wow!

440
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:08,035
[Dwi] Kelly mentioned allergy was one
of the first things.

441
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:10,037
And the story behind that

442
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:13,123
is my brother was allergic
to dogs and cat fur

443
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,667
so we couldn't get a dog
for the longest time

444
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,253
until we adopted schnauzers.

445
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,005
Those are hypoallergenic dogs.

446
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,924
So I forgot about that,
but that was spot on.

447
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:25,010
[Laura]
It's a little mind-boggling, right?

448
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,679
'Cause it doesn't fit our paradigm
of like, "Wait a minute..."

449
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:30,682
Here's this tangible...
Like, how does this make sense?

450
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:32,100
And yet, you can't deny that.

451
00:22:33,226 --> 00:22:36,855
It's obviously emotional
'cause it's like, who says that? [laughs]

452
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:38,740
- [Laura] Right.
- So, that's a little weird.

453
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,794
[Laura] I don't think there was
one thing on your list that didn't apply.

454
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:44,464
You know, the shocking element, of course,
is a bit of that kind of, like,

455
00:22:44,488 --> 00:22:47,366
"Oh, shit, did I just,
like, tap something?"

456
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:51,161
And then having Dwi validate that,
I thought was, like, insane.

457
00:22:51,661 --> 00:22:55,499
You know, it's always so amazing
to watch that process

458
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:58,752
and to watch someone discover
for the first time

459
00:22:58,835 --> 00:23:01,797
that they have this ability themselves,
because we all do.

460
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:06,301
But I've found people who deny
psychic abilities, mediumship,

461
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,154
"That's got to all be,
you know, fraudulent..."

462
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,180
The truth is, this is real.

463
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,807
You know, here's the thing about me.

464
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:14,643
If I didn't have all these abilities,
if I wasn't a psychic medium,

465
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:17,521
I think I'd really struggle
believing in it.

466
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:22,067
And that's why I want everybody
to just experience on his or her own.

467
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,069
We don't just accept something.

468
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:27,864
Come up with a question or explore an idea
and see where it leads you.

469
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,700
And so I was doing a reading for Ana.

470
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:34,830
- Oh, really?
- Yes, and she is a little, um...

471
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:36,289
- Skeptical.
- [Laura] Yes.

472
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,707
[laughing]

473
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,168
- I'm very excited to read for you.
- Excited.

474
00:23:40,252 --> 00:23:43,505
To me this whole...
this whole medium, psychic world

475
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:44,923
is very much like Santa Claus.

476
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:47,092
I get it.
It sounds too good to be true, right?

477
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,511
Like,
"Oh, death isn't real in the sense

478
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:54,224
of your consciousness is still there,
and they watch over us and love us..."

479
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,307
But that's the truth.

480
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,228
Just because something sounds
so fairytale-like and so beautiful,

481
00:23:58,311 --> 00:23:59,813
doesn't mean it's not true.

482
00:23:59,896 --> 00:24:03,567
Okay. First thing I want to say is there...
Are there twins in the family,

483
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,070
or, like, a Gemini birthday?
What is that, June?

484
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,530
No.

485
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:11,783
I keep seeing, like, two back to back.

486
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,077
- It's very...
- Back to back...

487
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:16,830
Like, I feel like
I want to talk about twins.

488
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,167
Hmm. I'm trying to think. No.

489
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:23,128
Okay, I'm going to tell them
to come back to me with that

490
00:24:23,211 --> 00:24:24,337
in another way later...

491
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,941
- Okay.
- ...if that's important, okay?

492
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:29,259
I do feel like a female figure

493
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:33,472
coming in on Mom's side of the family,
but I'm like a generation up.

494
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:37,267
Is there an aunt there that's crossed
or a great aunt for you?

495
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:38,350
It's like one over.

496
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,188
On my mom's side of the family?

497
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:44,065
Well, it's my upper right,
which is usually reserved for mom's side.

498
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:47,235
- That has passed?
- Yes, on the other side.

499
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,945
I have a female figure coming in,

500
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:50,947
and I feel like it's
your grandmother's sister.

501
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,491
That's how I want to say it.

502
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,576
My grandmother didn't have a sister.

503
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:58,997
I've had very few experiences
with mediums and psychics,

504
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:03,627
and I just... I've never had one
where I felt like personally connected.

505
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:05,295
Your reading's interesting, too,

506
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:08,131
because I feel like people
are just, like, coming in

507
00:25:08,215 --> 00:25:09,883
who aren't even that connected to you.

508
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:11,927
- Who I feel like I don't even know.
- Yeah, yeah.

509
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:14,513
It's one of those things
when you're proving something

510
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:18,099
that seems, like, outlandish and crazy,
you have to be spot on,

511
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:21,895
and you have to do it right
if you want to prove your point.

512
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:25,065
Okay, so it's kind of interesting to me.
Um...

513
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:27,776
I do feel like on Dad's side
of the family,

514
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,402
grandfather figure there...

515
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,336
- Mm-hmm.
- ...that I want to talk about.

516
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:33,031
Who in the family crossed very quickly?

517
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:37,118
I feel like a snap crossing, like...
[sighs] "I'm glad I went this way."

518
00:25:37,202 --> 00:25:39,287
Like, if you can't place it,
don't tell me.

519
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:40,997
I'm getting my snapping of fingers.

520
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:44,376
I feel like it was my grandfather
who passed quickly.

521
00:25:44,459 --> 00:25:45,770
- The one we're talking about?
- Mm-hmm.

522
00:25:45,794 --> 00:25:47,563
Okay, 'cause I get this, like...
[snaps fingers]

523
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,965
[Ana] I was hoping that she'd be able
to, like, say things

524
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:53,176
that were totally me
or totally my situation,

525
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:57,013
so then I could be like,
"Oh, okay, this is crazy, this is real,

526
00:25:57,097 --> 00:26:00,642
this is whatever it is,"
but I didn't feel that way at all.

527
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:03,186
Even like some things
that I was like, "Maybe..."

528
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,480
I felt were a little far-fetched.

529
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:10,819
Is there, like, a funny story
or a picture about a donkey

530
00:26:10,902 --> 00:26:12,696
or is there something with <i>Shrek?</i>

531
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:15,490
- Mnh-mnh.
- I'm seeing...

532
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:18,577
Is there anything with, like,
a trip to Mexico?

533
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:22,581
This is my "psychic charade" part,
and I'm seeing, like, a donkey,

534
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:25,125
and I'm not sure what I'm supposed
to say about it.

535
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:26,876
- I'm going to tell him...
- I don't know.

536
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,170
...to come back to me with it
in another way later.

537
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:31,756
[woman]
Hey, Laura, this is really strange...

538
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,175
I think you're actually reading Lindsay
right now.

539
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:36,210
- [laughing]
- That can happen.

540
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:39,598
- This is the problem with...
- [woman] Yeah, that's what I figured.

541
00:26:40,223 --> 00:26:42,475
So, those first people
who came in were yours, right?

542
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,561
- [Lindsay] Yeah, my grandma's a twin.
- [laughing]

543
00:26:44,644 --> 00:26:47,540
- Yeah, I was like, "There are no twins..."
- I'm like, "Who are these people?

544
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,524
'Cause they're not hers,
but they're blasting in."

545
00:26:49,566 --> 00:26:52,485
So this is what happens
when I'm open and they're determined.

546
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,487
And my grandfather passed away
last week,

547
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:57,407
and I'm getting married
in Mexico next year...

548
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,533
Oh, my God.

549
00:26:58,617 --> 00:26:59,701
I have chills right now.

550
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:03,038
He loves you so much,
he needed to get that message to you.

551
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:06,166
- Okay. That's crazy. [laughs]
- That's what happens, you know.

552
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:07,876
[Laura]
And I love that it got delivered.

553
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:17,135
My father was just joking

554
00:27:17,218 --> 00:27:19,012
that he really wanted
for the photo booth

555
00:27:19,095 --> 00:27:21,348
at our wedding
in Mexico to have a donkey...

556
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:22,825
- Stop it right now.
- [Ana] Oh, my God.

557
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:24,689
[Lindsay] Yeah, and my grandpa laughed
about it

558
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:26,728
in the hospital days before he passed.

559
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:29,731
- [Laura] That is so funny. I love this.
- [Ana] Wow.

560
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:32,817
I was behind the camera, taking notes,
doing my job,

561
00:27:32,901 --> 00:27:37,238
and I looked at my senior producer
and my executive producer,

562
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,574
and I was like kind of
tearing up and freaking out

563
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:42,285
and was like,
"Oh, my God, she's reading me

564
00:27:42,369 --> 00:27:43,995
while she was reading Ana."

565
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,331
And everybody was kind of like,
"It's a coincidence."

566
00:27:46,706 --> 00:27:50,085
And then once the Mexico thing happened,
I was like, "Okay, that's me."

567
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:54,547
I mean, it's hard not to be a believer
when all of these things happen.

568
00:27:54,631 --> 00:27:56,191
[Laura] You did exactly the right thing

569
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,235
because you're never supposed
to try and make it fit

570
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,261
or claim it if it's not yours, you know.

571
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:02,764
But it's always my job just
to deliver the messages,

572
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,140
but sometimes I don't even know.

573
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,141
But it's interesting, too,

574
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:08,019
when there are a lot of people around,
that will happen. [laughs]

575
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,980
That's so crazy.

576
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:13,817
Science is just a tool.
It's just one way of knowing,

577
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:16,111
and intuition is a way of knowing,

578
00:28:16,194 --> 00:28:18,905
but these sort of fringe areas
that go against

579
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:21,658
accepted mainstream scientific paradigm,

580
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:23,993
which is consciousness dies
with the body,"

581
00:28:24,077 --> 00:28:26,538
there aren't grants
to look at that kind of stuff.

582
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:30,375
It's really difficult,
and that's really unfair

583
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,419
that whole group of people

584
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:35,880
are being categorized
as unethical and fraudulent.

585
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:36,840
Right.

586
00:28:36,923 --> 00:28:38,683
[Laura]
I've been accused of horrible things,

587
00:28:39,092 --> 00:28:41,720
and I think ultimately,
we have to honor our own truths

588
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,054
and our own purposes.

589
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,748
That's been a journey for my soul,

590
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:47,934
is to trust in that and own that,
no matter what.

591
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:50,687
[Ana] I don't feel like
I'm closed off from it.

592
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:52,439
You can question as much as you want,

593
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:55,108
but then also, at some point,
you have to be open to change

594
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,986
or new ideas or being educated.

595
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:02,866
I get why people would
be skeptics and cynics. It's bizarre.

596
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:07,162
But I don't think there's any harm
into feeling more connected to my mother.

597
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,498
[Laura] The truth that I have come to know

598
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:14,878
is that consciousness exists outside
of bodily death,

599
00:29:14,961 --> 00:29:17,422
and our lives all intertwine

600
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,632
and interconnect in ways
that are so profound

601
00:29:19,716 --> 00:29:21,843
and so beautiful
that we can't even imagine.

602
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:25,180
This is a truth I want everyone
to know and embrace.

603
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:29,100
I think we are all a lot more in tune
with one another

604
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,226
than we think we are.

605
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,729
It's amazing how we can connect
with each other

606
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,231
if we just put in a little more intention
and effort.

607
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,155
[Gwyneth] My last question is...

608
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:46,367
- who is gonna be president in 2020?
- [laughing]

609
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,203
[Julie] I know.

610
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,916
[theme music playing]
