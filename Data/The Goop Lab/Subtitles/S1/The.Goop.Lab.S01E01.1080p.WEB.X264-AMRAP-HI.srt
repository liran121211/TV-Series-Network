1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,009
When I started goop in 2008,

2
00:00:09,092 --> 00:00:12,095
I was like, "My calling is something else
besides, you know,

3
00:00:12,178 --> 00:00:14,472
making out with Matt Damon
on screen or whatever."

4
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:15,557
[laughs]

5
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,310
And now, it's this modern lifestyle brand.

6
00:00:19,394 --> 00:00:23,481
To me, it's all laddering up to one thing,
which is the optimization of self.

7
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:26,192
Like, we're here one time, one life...

8
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,112
Like, how can we really, like,
milk the shit out of this?

9
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,195
[laughing]

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,532
You have a hundred needles
in your face, Elise.

11
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:34,826
Just another day at the office.

12
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:36,953
The opportunity that we have
with <i>the goop lab</i>

13
00:00:37,328 --> 00:00:40,665
is that, as a company, we can go out
in different groups

14
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,918
and go on a much deeper dive
into some of these topics

15
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,712
that our readers are curious about.

16
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:48,131
- [laughing]
- This is gonna be my first experience

17
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,358
- with mushrooms.
- [Gillian] Oh!

18
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:51,610
- [Kevin sighs]
- [woman] You have to let go of your ego.

19
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,112
[Gwyneth]
So what happens in a workshop?

20
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:55,096
- Everyone gets off.
- [woman moaning]

21
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:56,848
What the fuck are you doing to people?

22
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,183
[man vocalizes]

23
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:02,228
We get to explore, like, is this real?
Do we feel better?

24
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:04,647
And grapple
with some topics that are hard

25
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,816
and embarrassing or shameful.

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,318
Isn't that beautiful?

27
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,652
- [sighs]
- [woman 2] Relax.

28
00:01:09,736 --> 00:01:11,696
That was, like, next level shit.

29
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,407
So, are you guys ready
to go out in the field

30
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,076
and make a ruckus?

31
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:18,211
- [woman 3] Yeah.
- You can handle it, right?

32
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,871
[laughing]

33
00:01:28,505 --> 00:01:31,800
You can cry, you can scream,
you can pound the ground.

34
00:01:31,883 --> 00:01:34,886
The only thing we don't do
is get sexual with each other.

35
00:01:34,969 --> 00:01:36,387
And we don't take our clothes off.

36
00:01:36,471 --> 00:01:39,099
But other than that, like,
literally anything goes.

37
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,183
Just let it rip.

38
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,435
But once you take a psychedelic,

39
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,455
- you're in on the ride.
- You're fucked, basically.

40
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,647
[laughing]

41
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,492
- Down the hatch.
- [Elise] No turning back.

42
00:01:47,857 --> 00:01:51,027
We know at goop, obviously,
that psychedelics are controversial.

43
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,530
But what we try to do at goop
is to be open-minded

44
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:58,243
and explore ideas
that may seem out there or too scary,

45
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:00,912
so that people can have access
to the information

46
00:02:00,995 --> 00:02:02,372
and make up their own minds.

47
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,791
Yeah, a little bit of anxiety doing this
on camera,

48
00:02:04,874 --> 00:02:06,376
but whatever.

49
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:09,796
[woman 4] You know what's on
the other side is just total freedom.

50
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,381
Oh, fuck.

51
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:14,050
Very intense, full body experience.

52
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:15,277
[Elise] I was melting into the floor.

53
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:18,429
Time and space around me
had just dissipated.

54
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:21,558
I think it was the most
important experience of my life.

55
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,643
I feel like a different person.

56
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:25,728
[Elise] What have I gotten myself into?

57
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:27,230
[both laughing]

58
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:39,367
[indistinct chatter]

59
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,204
Okay. Welcome.

60
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:45,290
It's such an honor
to have you both here.

61
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,708
What a pleasure. Thank you.

62
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,544
[Gwyneth]
Can you explain to us what MAPS is?

63
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,882
MAPS is the Multidisciplinary Association
for Psychedelic Studies.

64
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:57,969
And it's an organization that supports
and does and fundraises

65
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,679
for psychedelic research.

66
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:03,099
I would personally love to know
a little bit about the trajectory

67
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:06,728
of using psychedelics
as a healing modality.

68
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,814
Psychedelics have been part
of the human history

69
00:03:09,898 --> 00:03:11,232
for thousands of years

70
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:14,944
in the context of spiritually,
healing, and celebration of transitions.

71
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,614
In the '60s, we had a battle

72
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:19,699
between the young folks, the hippies,

73
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,285
the baby boomers...
and we had the drug warriors.

74
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,370
Psychedelics were then criminalized.

75
00:03:25,163 --> 00:03:26,289
Well, psychedelics are back,

76
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,833
and they're being used
in the context of treatment.

77
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:37,800
[Gwyneth] Why do you think it's
coming into the mainstream now?

78
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:42,096
You know, depression, anxiety,
suicide is all increasing,

79
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:44,599
despite what we thought in the '90s
was this renaissance

80
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:49,145
of psycho-pharmacology, you know,
Prozac, Celexa, Zoloft.

81
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:53,024
Psychiatry left psychotherapy behind
and we embraced these drugs

82
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,193
that we all know give terrible
side effects.

83
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:58,196
And really, as a culture,
we're hungry for something else

84
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,031
and for something to help us heal.

85
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,114
Right.

86
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:04,744
So we wanted to explore psychedelics
in a therapeutic setting.

87
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:09,415
Um, we decided to try psilocybin,
also known as magic mushrooms,

88
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:12,043
in Jamaica,
where their use isn't regulated.

89
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:14,337
How did you choose who went on the trip?

90
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:17,257
So, the goop staff
sort of nominated themselves

91
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,633
and raised their hands.

92
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:22,387
I'd say almost everyone at goop
wanted to go to Jamaica.

93
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:26,808
And we wanted to sort of
explore different experiences.

94
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,852
Renee, who just wanted to feel
more creative

95
00:04:29,936 --> 00:04:31,688
and more like her authentic self.

96
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,857
I wanted to have a sort of
psycho-spiritual experience.

97
00:04:35,316 --> 00:04:39,112
And lastly, two people who wanted to work
on processing some personal trauma.

98
00:04:39,362 --> 00:04:41,531
So, we brought Jenny,
one of our photo editors,

99
00:04:41,614 --> 00:04:44,701
and Kevin, who's worked with Gwyneth
for about ten years.

100
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:48,079
I know Kevin is your family
at this point.

101
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:51,582
He is one of the most special,

102
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,671
loyal, loving people in the world.

103
00:04:56,754 --> 00:04:58,506
- I know. It makes me cry.
- Me too.

104
00:05:00,216 --> 00:05:03,678
- Here we are at LAX eating almonds.
- Good morning.

105
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,971
[Elise] There's Jenny.

106
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:09,392
- Renee, are you gonna sleep on the plane?
- I have an eye mask.

107
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:11,811
I have a pillow. I'm ready to sleep.

108
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,939
- Here we go, Jamaica, baby!
- [woman laughs]

109
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:18,192
[Kevin] Oh, Elise upgraded to first class.

110
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:19,569
How do you feel about that?

111
00:05:19,652 --> 00:05:21,988
Good for her, I feel very happy for her.

112
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:24,197
[laughs]

113
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:28,869
[birds squawk]

114
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:34,375
[Elise] So, unlike the clinical trials,

115
00:05:34,459 --> 00:05:36,586
we're doing this
in a more ceremonial setting.

116
00:05:37,003 --> 00:05:40,298
But our amazing facilitator, Gillian,
is affiliated with MAPS.

117
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:42,342
And Richard and Sasha who work with her

118
00:05:42,425 --> 00:05:44,177
are also very experienced therapists.

119
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:46,637
They're like... psychedelic elders.

120
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,142
[Sasha] So, welcome to the opening circle.

121
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:55,605
I just want to tell you just a little bit
of context.

122
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:59,067
So, the indigenous people who have
used these medicines for years

123
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:02,153
have really traditionally used them
curing illnesses,

124
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,738
like physical illnesses.

125
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,783
And they're rather perplexed
by us Westerners

126
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:10,578
that show up and want
to connect with the divine.

127
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:12,580
They think we're a little odd

128
00:06:12,663 --> 00:06:17,210
and what is missing is,
in their context, is <i>that </i>is our illness,

129
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:20,213
is that we do not have any connection

130
00:06:20,296 --> 00:06:23,216
with anything other than ourselves
and the material world.

131
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,634
So this is the medicine.

132
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:28,304
I really appreciate that you're joining us
on this journey together

133
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:32,100
and... we'll see you on the other side.

134
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:35,061
[birds chirping]

135
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:40,066
There must be something
that made you go, "I'm gonna do this,

136
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:42,735
and I'm gonna do this
in a therapeutic setting

137
00:06:42,819 --> 00:06:44,404
rather than a party setting."

138
00:06:44,487 --> 00:06:47,573
And so, we're really curious
about what that is for you,

139
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:49,700
so we can help you with that.

140
00:06:50,368 --> 00:06:55,790
I would like to understand myself
in the context of a bigger universe,

141
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:58,584
beyond how I intellectualize it
in my brain.

142
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:02,213
I want to surrender to the experience,

143
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:03,881
- let it happen.
- Yeah.

144
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:05,925
Try not to mentally override,

145
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,302
which is my inclination.

146
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:10,972
Anything that happens is perfect.

147
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:14,392
You can't do it wrong,
so you can simply relax.

148
00:07:14,725 --> 00:07:17,145
Oh, that's so much easier said than done.

149
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,021
[laughing]

150
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,107
This is gonna be my first experience

151
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:22,358
- with mushrooms.
- Oh!

152
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:25,236
I've been feeling
a little trapped and confined,

153
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:29,115
and so, to find that freedom,
to spread my wings.

154
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:34,579
So, I'm here to just let go more
and do a lot of healing

155
00:07:34,662 --> 00:07:39,375
and get over a lot of trauma
that I've experienced when my dad died.

156
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:43,421
So, I always associated myself with him.

157
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,214
I always felt more close to him.

158
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:49,969
And when he killed himself
five years ago,

159
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:55,933
it really just...
I mean, the doors swung open,

160
00:07:56,017 --> 00:08:00,938
and I've realized that he spent
much of his life depressed.

161
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:05,776
And we as a family
just didn't have the knowledge

162
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,028
of recognizing that.

163
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:09,030
It was just like, "That's how he is."

164
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:12,325
So, I assumed when I had those feelings,

165
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,660
that was just how I was.

166
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,955
I didn't really process it for a while.

167
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,499
It was five years ago,

168
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:21,918
and I just started
going to therapy this year.

169
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,688
[Richard] Well, I want to acknowledge
you're doing great, so...

170
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:25,588
Thank you.

171
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:28,299
And doing things the right way,
you know. You're here.

172
00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:31,636
You're asking questions.
You're expressing yourself.

173
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,971
It's really beautiful.
I commend you for that.

174
00:08:34,055 --> 00:08:35,055
Thank you.

175
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,057
How are you doing?

176
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:40,520
Um, it's a little nerve-racking, for sure.
Absolutely.

177
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:43,231
If you know, I've gone to Peru
and done ayahuasca,

178
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,650
and you're in this ceremony house
with all these strangers,

179
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,569
and you're shown something
from the medicine.

180
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,739
Then you're just sort of set off
on your own, and it's like,

181
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,991
"I saw something and, like,
what does that mean?

182
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:55,093
- And who can I talk to
- Yeah.

183
00:08:55,117 --> 00:08:57,429
- about something I saw?"
- [Gillian] Yeah, it's so important.

184
00:08:57,453 --> 00:09:00,456
How do you work through that?
And then you kind of bury it back down.

185
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,708
- This is why we're doing this work.
- Yeah.

186
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:05,670
What is it you want to shift?
What are you up to?

187
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:09,632
Well, you know, I sort of grew up
with an absent dad and, uh...

188
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,717
- so I think it's like...
- Mmm.

189
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,887
it's definitely caused issues

190
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:19,559
just getting close to people,
letting people in, you know.

191
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:22,216
- [Gillian] Because you can't trust them?
- [Kevin] Yeah.

192
00:09:22,353 --> 00:09:25,106
And just it's been a struggle
through most of my life.

193
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:29,026
Have you found other men
that you connect with, that...

194
00:09:29,694 --> 00:09:31,362
Uh, I mean, I have some friends.

195
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,823
Yes, I've had a few boyfriends
here and there.

196
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:36,450
But, you know, it's just sort of,
you get too close,

197
00:09:36,534 --> 00:09:39,745
and I just sort of shut the door
and pull back.

198
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,996
You know, we have questions
that we can't answer...

199
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,958
- Mm-hmm.
- ...questions from our childhood.

200
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,460
And so the medicine is there as a tool,

201
00:09:46,711 --> 00:09:49,255
so we can use it as a tool
to get some insight.

202
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:55,219
It's interesting, one thing that you said
that was very resonant about Kevin,

203
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,139
is that you said he's a seeker
and he's on this path.

204
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:02,226
[Gwyneth] All I want for him is
that he would have a kind of catharsis

205
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,981
that he could come home
and bring back to his life.

206
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:11,277
For him to find love and love himself.

207
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:13,821
[Elise]
Because he had tried so many things

208
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:16,741
and his experience in Peru,
where he went to do ayahuasca,

209
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:19,201
and essentially he had no idea really

210
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,096
- what he was experiencing.
- It's actually very scary.

211
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,832
Psychedelics amplify painful memories.

212
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,667
They amplify painful emotions.

213
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,104
They bring them to the surface
so that we can deal with them.

214
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:31,464
You've got these people
who are now flying down to Peru

215
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:34,759
or taking ayahuasca
in a warehouse in Brooklyn

216
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,845
without the proper support, thinking,
"Oh, I'm just going to take this

217
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:40,014
and I'm gonna be
much better the next day."

218
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:42,141
But it can actually be
incredibly destabilizing.

219
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,727
And you can actually feel worse
in the short term.

220
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,689
Is that why you hear of people
who took LSD and had psychic breaks?

221
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,876
- Like, they took it recreationally and...
- [Siu] Yeah.

222
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:53,736
The bad experience with psychedelics,
and there are many of them,

223
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,696
all come down to three things.

224
00:10:56,030 --> 00:10:59,200
It's inappropriate dosage,
inappropriate set,

225
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:02,119
which is the expectation going
into the experience,

226
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:03,371
or inappropriate setting,

227
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,998
and the setting is the environment
that it was taken in.

228
00:11:06,082 --> 00:11:08,751
If set, setting and dosage
are carefully managed,

229
00:11:09,126 --> 00:11:11,003
- we see intense experiences...
- Right.

230
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,673
and we see
periodically distressing experiences.

231
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:14,965
But that does not mean

232
00:11:15,049 --> 00:11:16,449
- they are bad experiences.
- Right.

233
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:27,269
I had taken psychedelics in my 20s
when it was still legal.

234
00:11:27,353 --> 00:11:29,897
So, I sort of had an idea
of what it might be like,

235
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,775
but this turned out to be
absolutely nothing like that.

236
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,485
I went to places I had never gone to.

237
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:47,873
I was in a phase where I was very anxious

238
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,251
about, uh, the disease coming back.

239
00:11:50,334 --> 00:11:53,212
I was just obsessing about the future,

240
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:56,340
"What if it comes back? What if it
comes back? What if it comes back?"

241
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:58,050
Yeah, it's not a good way to live.

242
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,138
One day online, I saw an advertisement

243
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:06,016
for the NYU Cancer Anxiety Study.

244
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:10,563
I realized that's me.
I'm a person that should be in that study.

245
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:14,942
It was using psychotherapy
and the drug psilocybin.

246
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:18,154
I experienced this realization,

247
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:20,906
you know, they talk about
the mind, body and the connection.

248
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:24,869
I experienced that
there's no connection at all.

249
00:12:24,952 --> 00:12:26,537
It's the same thing.

250
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:29,915
I experienced my body as my mind.

251
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,084
And then the last part of the day,
I spent, um...

252
00:12:32,877 --> 00:12:37,465
uh, having a very mystical,
spiritual experience,

253
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:40,509
which has sat with me,
and that's been seven years.

254
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:45,514
I've seen a profound change in my life
and a much greater openness.

255
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:51,103
This experience gave me the life
I have now, which I love.

256
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,233
[Richard]
Set and setting's really important,

257
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:57,902
the dosage you take,

258
00:12:57,985 --> 00:13:01,614
the environment that you're in,
the people that you choose to be with.

259
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,157
And that's what we set up.

260
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,869
We're going to give three grams,

261
00:13:07,411 --> 00:13:08,788
we're going to make it into a tea.

262
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:13,709
About 45, 50 minutes to an hour
you'd start to feel the effects.

263
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:16,921
You'll have about an hour and a quarter,

264
00:13:17,004 --> 00:13:20,466
an hour and a half of going into more
of a peak experience.

265
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,510
I'll be imbibing with you.

266
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:26,222
Gillian and Sasha will take
a tiny microdose.

267
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,100
This is a sacrament.

268
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:34,563
So we can be with the spirit
of the mushroom.

269
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,899
So blessings to everyone.

270
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:42,947
[laughing nervously]

271
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,950
- Cheers, dears.
- [Renee] Do we cheers?

272
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:47,159
[laughter]

273
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:48,160
[Richard] Cheers.

274
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,829
- [Elise] Cheers.
- [Jenny] Wow. Okay.

275
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:52,747
[Kevin] Mossy.

276
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,420
- [Jenny] Earthy.
- [exhales]

277
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:02,007
[Jenny] It's so funny when you start
something and you're like, "No regrets."

278
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:04,385
Too late, buckle up.

279
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:13,477
[Sasha] I'd love to explore letting go
of all the things

280
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:15,104
that we tend to identify with.

281
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,191
So you can start by letting go
of your name,

282
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:21,443
and then your job title.

283
00:14:21,902 --> 00:14:23,571
You know, that's just the work you do.

284
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,699
That doesn't really tell you
what you actually are.

285
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,494
Letting go of time,

286
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,163
no past, no future.

287
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,209
You can let go of your gender.

288
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,963
What happens if you kind of
get out of the driver's seat

289
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:44,758
and let life take care of itself...

290
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,470
without you, even just for a few minutes.

291
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:54,351
- [Elise] I'm already crying.
- [laughing]

292
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,038
- [Elise] I feel so uncomfortable.
- [Sasha] Are you feeling the effects?

293
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,062
[Elise] Yes.

294
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:02,276
Oh, my God.

295
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,404
What have I gotten myself into?

296
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:07,489
[laughing]

297
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,408
So how does it work?

298
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:15,331
So, traditional talk therapy
is a back and forth engagement.

299
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,125
- Oh, I know.
- [laughing]

300
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,502
And often a discussion about the issues

301
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,713
and maybe some suggested ways
of thinking about it.

302
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:25,674
Psychedelic psychotherapy's
completely different.

303
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:28,802
You get access
to somebody's unconscious material.

304
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,763
If I think about
what the unconscious mind is,

305
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:34,016
when we're driving a car,
we tend to think about lunch

306
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,684
and the meeting we're about to have.

307
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:39,146
All of our footwork and handwork
is unconscious.

308
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,899
- Right.
- So, when we have a tape loop

309
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,360
in our unconscious mind,
that's a trauma tape loop,

310
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,070
it's replaying itself.

311
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:49,448
We don't access it
because it's in our unconscious mind.

312
00:15:49,531 --> 00:15:52,326
Psychedelics can rework it,
we can expose it.

313
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:54,620
We can then shift
how that tape loop functions,

314
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:55,955
because we have access to it.

315
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,999
So what the mind tends to do
when we have a traumatic experience,

316
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:00,000
is that it splits.

317
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:01,794
It splits the memory from the emotion.

318
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:04,421
And what we want to do
with the healing is to have the memory

319
00:16:04,505 --> 00:16:07,341
of what happened
with the emotion combined

320
00:16:07,424 --> 00:16:09,802
and then have the empathic experience.

321
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:20,187
I honestly didn't think it would work,

322
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:24,066
but I figured,
"Everybody says MDMA is cool,

323
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,192
might as well try it."

324
00:16:36,245 --> 00:16:38,914
In 2005, I spent 12 months in Iraq.

325
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,667
Got up in the middle of the night
to use the restroom,

326
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:42,960
went into a porta john

327
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,004
and that's when the bad guys
decided to attack.

328
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:47,464
So, I got blown up
in a porta john in Iraq.

329
00:16:47,756 --> 00:16:50,217
Um, crappiest place to get blown up,
but, hey.

330
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:53,262
PTSD is a natural reaction.

331
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,557
When you're in a fight
or flight situation,

332
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:58,350
that's when it kicks in,

333
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,853
that's when the hypervigilance
and all these things happen.

334
00:17:00,936 --> 00:17:03,480
The PTSD keeps you alive in Iraq.

335
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,816
It doesn't become a problem
until you come home.

336
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:09,236
And within 60 days
of returning back from Iraq,

337
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:11,155
I had my first suicide attempt.

338
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:16,702
Every day was a struggle just to live.

339
00:17:16,785 --> 00:17:19,185
I had five suicide attempts
that should have been successful.

340
00:17:19,663 --> 00:17:21,599
I put a gun to my head twice
and pulled the trigger.

341
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:24,293
In one case, the ammunition was faulty
from the manufacturer,

342
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:25,936
and in the second case, a spring broke.

343
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,256
Every second of every day,
my brain told me to kill myself.

344
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:33,719
I started seeking counseling,
and I found MAPS,

345
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,305
the Multidisciplinary Association
for Psychedelic studies.

346
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:38,807
And they were doing a clinical trial

347
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,727
of psychotherapy
under the influence of MDMA.

348
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,607
And it's the greatest therapeutic
experience I've ever been in my life.

349
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:49,359
I'd be in therapy before,
and I wouldn't get near the trauma.

350
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:51,987
I'd specifically avoid talking
about the trauma

351
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:56,366
and talk about my day-to-day life
and what was causing me problems.

352
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:59,745
But MDMA mutes the amygdala,
which is the fear response.

353
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,163
That fight or flight.

354
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:02,873
I could actually get close to the trauma

355
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:06,752
and talk about it without my body
betraying me and causing panic attacks.

356
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,462
It was one of my guys...

357
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:13,092
and part of him getting hurt was my fault.

358
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:17,179
It was the first time
I could actually open up and deal with it.

359
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:19,890
It eliminated the suicidal ideation.

360
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:25,354
It's allowed me to live my life
rather than just merely exist.

361
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:28,607
This therapy has ensured

362
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:32,194
that my stepson has a father
instead of a folded flag.

363
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:39,159
Since you participated
in a legal MDMA study,

364
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:41,995
can you share your experience?

365
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:46,500
Sure. I took MDMA
as part of a legal MAPS trial

366
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,460
that was for therapists
who were in training.

367
00:18:48,544 --> 00:18:50,629
So it's important for us
to have our own experience

368
00:18:50,712 --> 00:18:52,352
so that we can be there for our patients.

369
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:56,552
Um, we face sadness, there's tears,
there's re-engaging with fear.

370
00:18:56,635 --> 00:18:59,930
You know, it's such
a beautiful experience that can happen

371
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:01,348
and the healing that results.

372
00:19:01,431 --> 00:19:04,852
You can have three, four
cathartic experiences in one session.

373
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:07,020
I think I'd better take some MDMA
with you.

374
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:08,647
Yeah. Haven't you tried it once?

375
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,691
Yeah, I did try it once in Mexico.

376
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:13,735
I never thought of MDMA as a psychedelic.

377
00:19:14,111 --> 00:19:17,614
and, um, when I took it,
I didn't hallucinate.

378
00:19:17,698 --> 00:19:19,992
Like, it wasn't a rave.

379
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:23,620
You know, it was actually
very, very emotional.

380
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:28,250
And, um, I was with my then boyfriend,

381
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:29,668
who's now my husband,

382
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:34,923
and he's a very empathetic,
very profoundly wise person.

383
00:19:35,007 --> 00:19:37,634
And he was able to
sort of help me through it.

384
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:42,764
But it does make me think, like,
there's so much to unearth if I did it,

385
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:45,767
- you know, like...
- Mm-hmm. In a therapeutic setting.

386
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:55,611
[indistinct distorted voices]

387
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:00,240
[Jenny]
The walls are coming down a little bit.

388
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:05,495
And I feel like that's why I get talkative
because I was not talk...

389
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:06,579
Like...

390
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:09,499
I remember being a kid

391
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:11,960
and everyone would
compliment my parents,

392
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:14,087
like, "Oh, she's so quiet,"

393
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:18,508
and I was, like, respectful as a child.

394
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:20,719
Like, yeah, 'cause I was,
like, scared to talk.

395
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:28,852
[laughing]

396
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,814
[Renee] Someone's got the giggles.

397
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:36,777
[Elise laughing]
I feel like such a cliche.

398
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,531
Stop.

399
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,243
- I'm just an amateur.
- [Sasha] I'm glad they're working, though.

400
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,328
[Elise] I'm going to pee my pants.

401
00:20:46,828 --> 00:20:49,039
[all laughing]

402
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,459
I thought I was inside a tree,

403
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:55,587
then I realized it was, like, in an organ,
and that was scary.

404
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:59,508
- Or a canal, a birth canal.
- Hmm. Hmm. Hmm.

405
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:01,635
- I don't know what's happening.
- [laughing]

406
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,931
[Elise]
Clouds have a really weird quality,

407
00:21:06,890 --> 00:21:09,017
but things in here
have a normal quality...

408
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:12,562
I think.

409
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:17,317
Is the sky crazy?

410
00:21:18,151 --> 00:21:19,903
The sky right now is crazy.

411
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:20,821
Right?

412
00:21:20,946 --> 00:21:22,114
[voice echoing]

413
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,658
I feel like you...
I did this as a kid, right?

414
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:27,160
Like, you just lie on your back
and watch the sky.

415
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:29,329
I don't remember the last time I did that.

416
00:21:39,881 --> 00:21:42,050
[Jenny laughs]
I've been through some emotions.

417
00:21:42,718 --> 00:21:43,635
[sighs]

418
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:47,014
Just memories of, like, being a kid.

419
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,934
[sniffling]

420
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,353
Spending time with my dad.

421
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:56,398
Like, thinking of memories of him.

422
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,277
[sobbing]

423
00:22:07,784 --> 00:22:09,786
[continues sobbing]

424
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,728
- [Jenny] It's like the energy of my dad.
- Support whatever is happening.

425
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,628
I just can feel, it was, like, him.

426
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:19,712
[mumbles]

427
00:22:19,963 --> 00:22:21,965
[continues sobbing]

428
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:25,302
And I feel like he wouldn't be happy
that I'm doing this.

429
00:22:25,385 --> 00:22:29,014
And, like, me resisting because of that,

430
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:30,974
- and then this...
- [Sasha] Mm-hmm.

431
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:36,605
release came of just, like,
"You need to let go of that, and..."

432
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,815
[Sasha] Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

433
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:42,277
It felt, like, very physical

434
00:22:42,402 --> 00:22:45,322
- and just, like, that release happened.
- Great.

435
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:48,575
[blowing nose]

436
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:52,746
- [woman] Ahh!
- [Sasha] I got another one here, too.

437
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,289
[Jenny coughs]

438
00:22:56,124 --> 00:22:58,126
- [sniffles]
- [woman] Ahh!

439
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:01,338
[Jenny exhales, laughs]

440
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,715
- [woman] Ahh!
- [Sasha laughs]

441
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:05,526
[Jenny laughing]
Now the tears have turned to laughter.

442
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,136
[Sasha] Good, good, let it.
They're both good. They're both good.

443
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:09,221
[Jenny groans]

444
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,937
- [Sasha] Do you need help with that?
- [sighs]

445
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:13,892
I'm gonna take it off.

446
00:23:21,149 --> 00:23:26,071
So, a microdose of mushrooms
is a very, very small amount

447
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:30,575
that is likely not to make you feel

448
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:34,121
the very intense psychoactive effects
of mushrooms.

449
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:41,711
I'd get, like, a very large quantity,
put it in my freezer and, you know...

450
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:45,465
grind 'em up in smoothies
and really slowly dose over the time.

451
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:48,385
And so I've probably been doing that
for about...

452
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:51,513
[laughs] Oh, my God. It's, like,
six years now. It's a long time.

453
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:55,892
I was personally going through a lot
of depression and trauma and anxiety.

454
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:59,229
I progressed towards feeling
really, really suicidal.

455
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:02,482
My mind became my worst enemy.

456
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:05,819
I think for people of color,
um, specifically,

457
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:09,489
we have, like, a culture of being hard

458
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:12,576
and not really facing things
like mental illness,

459
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,078
or even just, like, emotional pain. Um...

460
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:18,248
But I had been going to therapy.
I'd been giving it the old college try.

461
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:21,501
But that could only take me so far,

462
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,712
Um, I needed something else.

463
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,798
And mushrooms were sort of the gateway

464
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,842
towards a better sense of healing for me

465
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:33,513
that I really wasn't able to find
on my own, you know.

466
00:24:33,597 --> 00:24:37,601
Over this time, I've witnessed
a transformation in myself

467
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,284
that I really didn't think was possible.

468
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:41,438
I know that this is illegal,

469
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:44,483
but I feel like people can say
what they wanna say about it,

470
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,736
but until they're in a position
where they're about to take their life,

471
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,530
I don't feel like they can judge me,
if that makes any sense.

472
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:56,161
What we do in the context of research
is completely different

473
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,330
- from what happens on the street.
- Right.

474
00:24:58,413 --> 00:25:02,042
So at no point are we advocating
that people start taking MDMA

475
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,460
or LSD or anything else.

476
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:07,672
And really, it's this turbulent process
that the therapist really has to ride.

477
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,091
And it's complicated and difficult.

478
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:13,845
Do you believe that our bodies
store the trauma somewhere,

479
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:16,097
or is it entirely locked
in the subconscious?

480
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:20,268
Because what we observed in Jamaica
through our experience

481
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:24,814
was that it was releasing
from people in all different ways.

482
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:30,195
Yes, I absolutely think that emotions
and memory are stored in our body,

483
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:34,699
and we're seeing that in the patients
that work with psilocybin and MDMA.

484
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:37,327
You know, in psychology
and psychiatry we're taught,

485
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:40,181
"Don't put your hands on patients.
Oh, my God, you're gonna get in trouble."

486
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,974
But I think if we don't learn
to do that better,

487
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,438
we're gonna actually lose some
of the opportunity for healing.

488
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:47,003
[Richard] You're doing great.

489
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:48,922
- Yeah, go on.
- [exhales]

490
00:25:50,173 --> 00:25:51,299
Where's Sasha?

491
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:52,693
- [Richard] Sasha.
- [Sasha] I'm right here.

492
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:57,055
Okay. Yeah, I feel like, I don't know,
your energy's pretty good.

493
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:58,578
Oh, my God, I don't know what it is.

494
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,141
[Richard] Hey, take him on. Yeah.

495
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,561
- Yeah, we got you. We got you.
- Oh, shit.

496
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:05,814
- [inhales, exhales]
- [Richard] There you go.

497
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:12,529
I was on my way there again
to the light source.

498
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:13,612
[Sasha] Yeah.

499
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:15,448
Oh, fuck.

500
00:26:15,699 --> 00:26:16,908
[Sasha] Yeah.

501
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:19,286
- [Kevin whimpers]
- [Sasha] Can we just...

502
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:21,496
- [Richard] Yeah.
- [Sasha] Got it.

503
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:25,208
[Kevin sobbing]

504
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:30,130
[Richard gently humming]

505
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:34,634
[Kevin gasps, continues sobbing]

506
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,849
[exhaling]

507
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,767
[sighs]

508
00:26:43,727 --> 00:26:46,021
[Kevin] I feel like I'm the light
of the center...

509
00:26:46,104 --> 00:26:47,864
- the center of the circle right now.
- Yeah.

510
00:26:51,985 --> 00:26:53,236
[exhales happily]

511
00:26:54,362 --> 00:26:56,489
[Richard] Good work. Yes, we are.

512
00:26:57,198 --> 00:27:00,452
- Someone get a heart rate monitor on me.
- [laughing]

513
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:07,000
- [Sasha] Keep going, keep going.
- [Kevin] That's a real psychedelic.

514
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:09,586
- [Richard] Ready?
- Oh, my whole body's vibrating.

515
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,671
[Sasha] Keep going, keep going,
keep going.

516
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:20,096
[Elise]
It was very beautiful, very profound

517
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,223
to lie there next to Kevin

518
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:25,977
and watch him be held by these two men

519
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:28,271
who were embracing him

520
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:32,651
in a way that he hadn't been embraced
as a child by his own father,

521
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:35,487
and, I mean, besides what was happening,

522
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:38,198
you don't even see those sorts
of expressions

523
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:40,325
- from adult men to adult men.
- Mm-hmm.

524
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:42,952
Um, so, that was very powerful.

525
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,914
That's an angle that in Western culture
we don't really have.

526
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:50,710
There's kind of no rubric
for how we deal with discomfort

527
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:52,504
and how we deal with trauma,

528
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:53,922
how we deal with conflict,

529
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:57,133
and suppression seems
to have become the main way.

530
00:27:57,217 --> 00:28:02,097
Suppression and distraction
and avoidance and "I'm a tough guy"

531
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,641
are all the norms of our society today.

532
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,518
And psychedelics are the opposite.

533
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:09,104
We need to find ways of connecting people.

534
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,313
Yeah. No, absolutely.

535
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,083
These medicines
are medicines of connection.

536
00:28:12,107 --> 00:28:15,193
You look at the team at goop,
everyone here, at some level,

537
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:17,612
is a deeply successful person, right?

538
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:21,783
And yet, they are all carrying

539
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,202
a tremendous amount of pain and loss.

540
00:28:24,285 --> 00:28:26,204
And I think so many of us are taught,
like,

541
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:29,708
"You're thriving, you're good.
Like, how dare you!"

542
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:33,253
You know, you, for example,
what could possibly be wrong with you?

543
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:34,254
You have everything.

544
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:37,215
You're beautiful.
You're wealthy. You're famous.

545
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:39,968
- Like, shut up. You know?
- [laughing]

546
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,971
But I think that that is
the perfect example

547
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:46,975
of how our lack of understanding...

548
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:50,520
- [Mark] Yes.
- And also, you know, to the larger point,

549
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:54,858
this is where this systemic cultural lack
of connection comes in.

550
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,986
If everybody felt connected,
they would understand

551
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:01,156
that I, as well,
have had incredibly painful

552
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,449
and traumatic experiences.

553
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,659
And I had a lot of trauma in my childhood,

554
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,079
and being the person
that people perceive me to be

555
00:29:08,163 --> 00:29:09,539
is inherently traumatic.

556
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:11,166
Like... you know?

557
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:14,836
So, I think that lack of connection
that you describe

558
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:19,549
that is really so pervasive right now
is kind of part of that.

559
00:29:20,508 --> 00:29:23,344
Yeah, I have a private practice
where I see wealthy clients,

560
00:29:23,428 --> 00:29:26,431
poor clients, famous people,
and just average Joe.

561
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:27,834
But within two or three sessions,

562
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:31,144
everyone is talking about relationships
and disconnection.

563
00:29:31,227 --> 00:29:33,938
I've been in mental health,
I think, seven years,

564
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:36,149
and I've been on this earth 39 years,

565
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:38,735
and I don't think I've ever met
a healthy person yet.

566
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:42,238
Aside from, like, maybe the few masters
that are on this Earth,

567
00:29:42,322 --> 00:29:44,324
I really think we're all suffering
to some extent,

568
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,910
and we're on this journey of healing.

569
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:54,334
[Elise] This is not a typical
workplace experience.

570
00:29:54,459 --> 00:29:58,797
Although, I kind of wonder
if it wouldn't be incredibly therapeutic

571
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,716
for workplace teams
if you felt really safe

572
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,427
and wanted to become
even more intimate and connected

573
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:07,305
with the people that you spend
the majority of your day with.

574
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,098
At the end of the day,

575
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:12,519
this idea that this work needs
to be done in secret,

576
00:30:12,852 --> 00:30:14,437
that it's shameful,

577
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:19,067
that it is not appropriate
to be vulnerable in front of other people,

578
00:30:19,275 --> 00:30:23,696
I think is one of the paralyzing things
going on in our society.

579
00:30:26,115 --> 00:30:28,993
So, I would like to talk about integration

580
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:31,329
so that you keep what you got.

581
00:30:31,538 --> 00:30:35,375
When you feel yourself sliding,
because you will.

582
00:30:35,917 --> 00:30:39,629
You will because of the chaos.
It isn't always like this.

583
00:30:39,712 --> 00:30:41,673
We're in the Garden of Eden right now

584
00:30:41,756 --> 00:30:43,925
and then we go back
into all that other stuff.

585
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:45,008
Right.

586
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,554
The place you want to stay in
and want to be in

587
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:50,932
isn't linked to Jamaica
or Los Angeles or anywhere.

588
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,308
It's in you.

589
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:55,061
So, you can actually create that
for yourselves

590
00:30:55,144 --> 00:30:57,313
in the middle of a war zone.

591
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:03,069
In all honesty, I have never felt
the way I did last night,

592
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:04,028
ever in my life.

593
00:31:04,112 --> 00:31:07,407
[Richard] We've all gone through this
process together, and you have each other.

594
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,826
- [Kevin] Mm-hmm, yes.
- Right? So that's a resource.

595
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:11,804
[Jenny]
I still feel like I'm processing a lot.

596
00:31:11,828 --> 00:31:14,789
Like, I'm really drained physically
and emotionally.

597
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:18,251
And I feel like I went through about,
like, five years of therapy

598
00:31:18,334 --> 00:31:20,044
in about five hours.

599
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:23,089
[Sasha] Thank you guys
for just putting your hearts into it

600
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:25,383
- and your souls and yeah.
- [Kevin] Mm-hmm.

601
00:31:25,466 --> 00:31:27,093
- Sorry.
- [Sasha chuckles]

602
00:31:31,723 --> 00:31:34,726
I think it's so admirable
what you both are doing.

603
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,312
We've just scratched the surface
of where we're going to go

604
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,314
- with psychedelic psychotherapy.
- Right.

605
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,399
Hopefully what will happen is therapists,

606
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:43,943
healers, psychologists and psychiatrists

607
00:31:44,027 --> 00:31:46,279
will observe the benefits
across our country.

608
00:31:46,654 --> 00:31:49,198
And then more and more psychedelics
will become on stream,

609
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:53,036
and the wider window of indications
they will be used for

610
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:56,623
will essentially bring psychedelics back
into mainstream psychiatry

611
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:57,832
and mainstream psychology.

612
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,376
And it will be a tool for healing
that will be used widely.

613
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:03,630
MAPS has actually already applied
to the government

614
00:32:03,713 --> 00:32:06,633
to get special access
before it's fully rescheduled.

615
00:32:06,716 --> 00:32:08,843
So, that application process is in.

616
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:12,597
I think MAPS is training about
250 or 300 therapists this year

617
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,098
to prepare for that wave.

618
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:17,894
And so, maybe we can do
a goop MDMA-assisted therapy clinic.

619
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:18,977
Yeah, it's happening.

620
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:21,147
- Sounds like a Christmas party.
- I know.

621
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:23,232
[all laughing]

622
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:31,115
Thank you for allowing me
to leave your very busy life.

623
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:32,951
- [chuckling]
- That was really hard.

624
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:36,037
- I had four panic attacks without you.
- Oh.

625
00:32:36,496 --> 00:32:37,664
Since going through it,

626
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:41,501
what's been your experience
of, like, being in your body?

627
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:44,128
- I've definitely like more of an openness
- Uh-huh.

628
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,798
- and hopefully letting people in.
- Yes!

629
00:32:46,881 --> 00:32:47,715
[Kevin laughing]

630
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,926
So, I mean, it's still very fresh to me.

631
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:54,597
As I was laying there,
sort of all of my ego

632
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:57,642
and things that sort of hold me back
from who I am,

633
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:59,143
I just let go of all of that.

634
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,913
Like, I wasn't in the room
with a camera crew.

635
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:04,691
I wasn't Kevin being shy
or nervous or whatever it was,

636
00:33:04,774 --> 00:33:06,067
I just kind of let it go.

637
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:10,738
I felt like a young, little boy,

638
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,866
and all I wanted to do was, like, be held,

639
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:16,119
and I've sort of never
felt that way before.

640
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:22,417
Did you think having the therapist there
guiding you through it was essential?

641
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,335
Yes. Someone to talk to and be like,

642
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,462
"Hey, why did this happen,
and how did this come up,

643
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,965
and what does this all mean actually?"
You know?

644
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:29,924
It's amazing.

645
00:33:30,008 --> 00:33:34,762
It's like that incredible
intense bravery around healing yourself.

646
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:36,806
And I just think you're really brave

647
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:38,209
- and really amazing.
- Thank you.

648
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:42,603
I've been carrying this
sort of emptiness and loneliness around

649
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:45,064
for 36 years now.

650
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:51,195
I've been carrying this emptiness
and loneliness around for 39 years.

651
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,281
[laughing]

652
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:56,701
And thank you for letting me
do all of this fun stuff.

653
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,161
- Shut up.
- No, thank you.

654
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:00,254
- [Gwyneth] I love you so much.
- I love you.

655
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:09,297
