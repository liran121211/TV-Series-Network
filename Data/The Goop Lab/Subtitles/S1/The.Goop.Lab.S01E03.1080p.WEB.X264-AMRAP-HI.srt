1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:08,925
When I started goop in 2008,

2
00:00:09,009 --> 00:00:11,970
I was like, "My calling is something else
besides, you know,

3
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:14,472
making out with Matt Damon
on screen or whatever."

4
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:15,556
[laughs]

5
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,436
And now, it's this modern lifestyle brand.

6
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,481
To me, it's all laddering up to one thing,
which is optimization of self.

7
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:26,192
Like, we're here one time, one life.

8
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,112
Like, how can we really, like,
milk the shit out of this?

9
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,363
[laughing]

10
00:00:30,447 --> 00:00:32,532
You have a hundred needles
in your face, Elise.

11
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:34,826
- Just another day at the office.
- [laughing]

12
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:36,953
The opportunity that we have
with the goop lab,

13
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,665
is that, as a company, we can go out
in different groups

14
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,918
and go on a much deeper dive
into some of these topics

15
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:46,212
- that our readers are curious about.
- [laughing]

16
00:00:46,296 --> 00:00:48,173
This is gonna be my first experience

17
00:00:48,256 --> 00:00:49,400
- with mushrooms.
- [woman] Oh!

18
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:51,551
- [exhales]
- [woman] You have to let go of your ego.

19
00:00:51,634 --> 00:00:53,112
[Gwyneth Paltrow]
So what happens in a workshop?

20
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,679
- Everyone gets off.
- [woman moaning]

21
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,848
What the fuck are you doing to people?

22
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,183
[man vocalizing]

23
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:02,562
We get to explore, like, "Is this real?
Do we feel better?"

24
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,731
And grapple with some topics that are hard

25
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:06,816
and embarrassing or shameful.

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:09,694
- Isn't that beautiful? Relax.
- [exhales]

27
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,696
That was, like, next level shit.

28
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,407
So, are you guys ready to go out
in the field

29
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:16,910
- and make a ruckus?
- [Elise Loehnen] Yeah.

30
00:01:16,993 --> 00:01:19,120
- You can handle it, right?
- [laughing]

31
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,715
[theme music playing]

32
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,969
[Betty Dodson] Hand over hand.
You want to focus on your breathing.

33
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:38,181
You want to focus
on the sensation in your vulva,

34
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:41,017
and you want to focus
on your body's movement.

35
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,037
[Carlin Ross]
Orgasms don't drop down from heaven.

36
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:45,230
[Gwyneth] For men,
it does drop out of the sky,

37
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:47,899
and for women, it's a different,
much different experience.

38
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:52,070
[Elise] I would imagine
a vast majority of women

39
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:56,074
have experienced shame
around their own pleasure.

40
00:01:56,157 --> 00:01:59,327
I was feeling weird
even letting the person,

41
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:02,122
like my partner, touch me during sex.

42
00:02:02,205 --> 00:02:04,874
[Elise] It's really about the connection
you have with yourself.

43
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:08,503
I have never done the whole mirror,
what's happening down there.

44
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,046
You've never seen yourself?

45
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:11,714
- No.
- [Betty] Come over here.

46
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,633
[laughing]

47
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:17,011
- [Carlin] We teach women how to orgasm.
- Wow.

48
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:19,639
- So, could you flip over my hand?
- [woman] Yeah.

49
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,432
[Carlin] Say what you need.

50
00:02:21,516 --> 00:02:23,268
That's very, very hard for women.

51
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:27,814
[Betty] We have to have self
to be able to take control.

52
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:31,234
So, have a healthy sexual relationship
with yourself,

53
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:33,987
so that you're coming
to your sexual partner

54
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,448
as an active participant
in your sexual experience.

55
00:02:37,532 --> 00:02:39,218
- To say what they want.
- We used to say...

56
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:42,036
that a woman had to learn how
to "run the fuck."

57
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,037
- Wow.
- [laughs]

58
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:45,623
[Betty] And if you can't say it,
you're in trouble.

59
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:47,000
"Run the fuck."

60
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,043
[laughing]

61
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,045
- [Betty] Are you blushing?
- Yes.

62
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:53,131
[laughing]

63
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,600
[Gwyneth] Okay.

64
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,769
- Are you ready to talk about vaginas?
- I'll run.

65
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,479
- It's our favorite subject.
- Who?

66
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:10,148
- Vaginas!
- [laughing]

67
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:13,151
The vagina's the birth canal only.

68
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:15,570
You want to talk about the vulva,

69
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:19,699
which is the clitoris and the inner lips
and all that good shit around it.

70
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:22,118
[laughing]

71
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,371
- The vagina is only the birth canal?
- [Betty] Birth canal.

72
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:28,249
Oh. See, I'm getting an anatomy lesson
that I didn't...

73
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:29,959
I thought the vagina was the whole...

74
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,043
No, no, no.

75
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,671
[Carlin] That's why Betty's focus
has always been on vulva.

76
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:35,673
That's everything
that makes you feel good,

77
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:40,053
so that's her pet peeve
with vulva versus vagina. [laughs]

78
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,847
How long have you been doing this work?

79
00:03:43,264 --> 00:03:44,140
Forever.

80
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,267
I mean, I'm already 90.

81
00:03:58,696 --> 00:04:00,657
So, what happens in a workshop?

82
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:04,077
- Everyone gets off.
- [laughing]

83
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,662
[Carlin] We answer the door naked,

84
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:07,585
'cause I want them
to know I'm being vulnerable

85
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,290
'cause I'm asking you to be vulnerable.

86
00:04:09,374 --> 00:04:11,542
And then we get naked
and we sit in a circle.

87
00:04:12,126 --> 00:04:13,836
Sign me up. [laughing]

88
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,129
Sign me out.

89
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,257
Like, naked in a room
with a bunch of women?

90
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,620
I don't know if I have the guts.

91
00:04:18,967 --> 00:04:22,136
There's no judgment.
It's acceptance of our bodies.

92
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,380
And what you'll see is
when you look around the room...

93
00:04:25,223 --> 00:04:26,432
everyone's beautiful.

94
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:27,392
Yeah.

95
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:31,980
Shame, I think pervades
so much of our sexuality.

96
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:33,856
I can't think of anything

97
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,318
more demanding you to be shame-free

98
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:40,321
than sitting naked in a room
with other women.

99
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:41,489
[laughing]

100
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,783
All of that goes away immediately.

101
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,410
- [Gwyneth] Right.
- It really does.

102
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,288
I have days when I go,
"Ugh. The skin doesn't fit.

103
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,123
It's all blotchy.
I got all these bruises."

104
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,125
I could carry on and on and on.

105
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:57,213
I can walk. I can talk. I can see.
I still can have orgasms,

106
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:01,342
so why would I want to complain
about a wrinkle or whatever?

107
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,428
I kind of want to do this.

108
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:06,848
- I dare you to do it.
- [laughing]

109
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:08,766
I might do it. I might show up.

110
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,518
[Carlin] That would be great.

111
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:13,980
Put a group together here
and I'll come back and lead one.

112
00:05:14,063 --> 00:05:17,400
- Uh-oh. It's an HR crisis.
- Should we do it?

113
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:20,236
[laughing]

114
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,824
So, how important do you think it is
for women clothed, unclothed

115
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,243
to be having these conversations?

116
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,204
I think it's everything.
I mean, sisterhood, I can't imagine...

117
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,956
Not being able to talk.

118
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,810
Not being able to be with a group of women
a couple of times of the year,

119
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:37,295
just to recharge and just to connect.

120
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,505
I mean, there's something
so powerful about it.

121
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,133
- And healing at the same time.
- Yeah.

122
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:45,762
A group of goop staffers
did a different workshop,

123
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:50,433
fully clothed, where they explored
being in their bodies,

124
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,603
learning how to ask
for what they want and need.

125
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,271
[Betty] Oh, amazing.

126
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,661
[Megan]
I wanted to take part in this workshop

127
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,997
because I'm married, and it's wonderful,

128
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,875
but I think intimacy is hard,

129
00:06:15,958 --> 00:06:18,294
even when you love someone
and you're really close.

130
00:06:18,461 --> 00:06:21,714
Sex education for me
was me learning from encyclopedias

131
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,299
and learning through rumors.

132
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,427
Even when I started
to come into my own as a woman,

133
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:28,721
I still didn't have any education
about pleasure.

134
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:29,806
We have a long way to go,

135
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:33,684
and I think starting to talk about this
is the right way to do it.

136
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:35,436
Welcome, everybody.

137
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,480
I'm super excited that you're here today

138
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,817
and that you're gonna prioritize
your pleasure and your sensuality

139
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,260
and your connection with yourself.

140
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:46,823
Let's share what our biggest challenge is
in the realm of sexuality,

141
00:06:46,906 --> 00:06:49,242
body, self, sex shame...

142
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:55,456
I would like to feel more sensual
just in general

143
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,751
and have it not be contingent
on compliments

144
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:04,132
and other people and the perception
of what sexy and sensual is.

145
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:08,886
Similar to Megan, I would really like
to feel sensual at work

146
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:12,098
or when I'm cooking
or when I'm being creative.

147
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,142
Some days I feel like a blob.

148
00:07:14,225 --> 00:07:16,269
I feel like, you know, this, that.

149
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:20,356
And for me,
it's very much associated with my body.

150
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,160
[Isabella] Okay, so there's
some body shame.

151
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,986
Exactly, like, if I ran that morning...

152
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:27,780
or I didn't, or you know,
something like that

153
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:30,199
or my clothes aren't fitting
like I want it to.

154
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:31,969
[Isabella] Do you feel like
you have to earn

155
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,633
- having a positive body image?
- Exactly.

156
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:36,622
- Okay.
- I think 100% for me.

157
00:07:36,873 --> 00:07:41,210
We feel ashamed to, like,
talk about women having sexual needs

158
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:42,628
and wants and things like that,

159
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:44,398
and you don't talk about it
with your friends.

160
00:07:44,422 --> 00:07:47,675
No one talks about it in school,
about pleasure just in general.

161
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:49,210
So, you don't learn about it,

162
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,321
and you grow up thinking
it's something that you keep in,

163
00:07:51,345 --> 00:07:52,465
and you keep it to yourself.

164
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:55,516
In the long run, you don't end up
sharing that with your partner,

165
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,393
who you want to experience that with.

166
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,854
So then it just gets locked in,
closed up...

167
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:03,524
[laughs] Hi, ladies. I'm Lexi.

168
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,735
When I first heard that goop

169
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,070
was doing this episode
about female pleasure,

170
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,281
I was like, "I have to participate in it,"

171
00:08:10,364 --> 00:08:13,409
because I have personally struggled
with sexual wellness.

172
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:17,079
I grew up in Shanghai,
where sex wasn't talked about,

173
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:20,041
and I have never really talked
to my parents

174
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:23,169
about sex or my sexuality,
being a gay woman,

175
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:26,005
so I didn't really know what sex was.

176
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:30,176
goop is such a safe environment
for me to explore my sexual wellness,

177
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:33,596
and goop has been very supportive
of this topic as well.

178
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,474
In my past relationships with other women,

179
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:42,230
I was the one who was
mostly giving in the sexual relationship.

180
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:44,398
I was feeling weird

181
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,568
even letting my partner touch me
during sex,

182
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:49,946
or even... I was like,
"I want to turn the light off."

183
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,197
I don't want the light on.

184
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,991
I just feel a little bit of disconnect
with my body,

185
00:08:54,075 --> 00:08:57,620
and I feel like I think I want
to be able to receive.

186
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,916
[Isabella] You have all earned the right
to feel good in your body

187
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,417
and to feel sensual.

188
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:07,338
There is absolutely nothing
that you need to do to earn that.

189
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,757
You can work out 'cause you feel strong.

190
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:10,675
[Heaven] Yeah.

191
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:14,720
[Isabella] That needs to be very separate
from the way you see yourself.

192
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:19,767
So many of us women are caught
in this paradigm

193
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:21,435
that we have to look a certain way

194
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:24,272
and, you know,
we're so critical of ourselves.

195
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:27,066
It's funny 'cause I'm not critical
of another woman's body,

196
00:09:27,149 --> 00:09:29,110
but I'm so critical of my own body.

197
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:31,112
[Carlin] That's true for, like,
every woman.

198
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,448
For hundreds of years,

199
00:09:35,032 --> 00:09:39,328
men have been painting, sculpting
and photographing women,

200
00:09:39,453 --> 00:09:41,998
and the second
you put a camera in her hand,

201
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,124
it becomes vain,

202
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:48,087
because people are uncomfortable
when you say, "I feel beautiful."

203
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:50,631
So, let's get into our sensual vibes

204
00:09:50,715 --> 00:09:52,609
and then we're gonna take
our portraits together.

205
00:09:52,633 --> 00:09:53,843
- Yeah.
- Awesome!

206
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,761
Are you ready?

207
00:09:55,886 --> 00:09:57,197
- Yeah. I think so.
- [Isabella] Okay.

208
00:09:57,221 --> 00:10:00,016
So, this is a time for you
to just express yourself however you want.

209
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:04,478
Sensual self-portraits
are a visual representation

210
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,480
of your sexual relationship with yourself.

211
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,360
It's important to be in charge
of how you feel as a sensual creature.

212
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,698
Three, two, one, beautiful.

213
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:19,553
[Lexi] I've been through some body issues,

214
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:22,622
and I have struggled
to put myself out there

215
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,831
and share my own body.

216
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,834
[Isabella] Oh, my God, you look so strong!

217
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:30,046
You look like you're fierce,
like you're about to start running.

218
00:10:31,422 --> 00:10:32,632
[Lexi] I just want to be me.

219
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,884
I just wanna be happy
and do what I want to do.

220
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:36,844
[Isabella] Love it.

221
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,735
Which is your favorite one, do you think?

222
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:44,143
- I like all of 'em.
- Yay! I love it.

223
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:46,896
[Lexi] This is, like,
the most authentic self.

224
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,440
I enjoy working out. I love boxing...

225
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:54,111
Yeah, it makes me feel more confident,
sexier, more sensual,

226
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,655
like I'm taking care of myself,

227
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,990
like, having fun too at the same time.

228
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,367
[Isabella] It's beautiful.

229
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,038
[gull squawking]

230
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:10,878
I wonder how much disassociation
you guys see

231
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,588
of women from their bodies.

232
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:15,049
Oh, complete... Yes.

233
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,926
[Betty] And in the female genitals.

234
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:20,054
You hear the same stories,
and it's always like,

235
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,972
you know, "I'm dirty down there."

236
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:25,309
There is always this genital shame
that happens when...

237
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,061
Wow. Why? Where do we get that?

238
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:28,478
[Betty] The culture.

239
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:32,024
Think of all the nicknames,
"pussy, snatch."

240
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,710
- [Carlin] It's not very positive.
- Right.

241
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,379
[Carlin] Even just the language by itself.

242
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:37,863
[Gwyneth] My boy turned 13 yesterday.

243
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:41,784
You know, when I think about the access
he has to pornography,

244
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:44,537
like the way that women are portrayed
in pornography.

245
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:47,206
Yeah, the women lie there,
and they have a certain look,

246
00:11:47,289 --> 00:11:49,959
and their genitals are surgically altered.

247
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:50,876
Really?

248
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:52,795
[Carlin] Most women
have dangling inner lips

249
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:55,673
- and what they do is they cut the labia.
- Oh, my God.

250
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:58,443
- [Carlin] And they bleach everything pink.
- I've never heard this before.

251
00:11:58,467 --> 00:12:01,178
So, everyone looks like a baby doll.
They look like a teen girl.

252
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:02,096
[Gwyneth] Like a Barbie.

253
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:05,015
That's why women come in and they're like,
"There's something wrong.

254
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:08,644
I have dark inner lips,"
or "they're not symmetrical."

255
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:24,618
I had the good fortune

256
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:29,457
to have a very curious, intelligent lover,

257
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:33,961
and he wanted to look at me, and I went,
"Oh, no, I'd rather you wouldn't."

258
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:37,506
He said, "Why not?"
And I said, "I'm deformed."

259
00:12:38,257 --> 00:12:39,842
I was a grown woman

260
00:12:39,925 --> 00:12:42,678
thinking I was sexually deformed

261
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,431
that my vulva had these long inner lips.

262
00:12:46,223 --> 00:12:48,017
I didn't think it was normal.

263
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,520
And he said,
"Honey, you're perfectly normal."

264
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:55,691
And he went and got these books
that he used to masturbate to.

265
00:12:56,066 --> 00:12:58,402
And he pointed.
He said, "There's one like you,

266
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,321
and another...
Oh, and there's another one."

267
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,448
So, it was such a revelation to me.

268
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:06,619
And so, from that day on,
my sex life improved.

269
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,204
I didn't feel the shame,

270
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,832
and shame is a killer of pleasure.

271
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,127
So, that's when I started
doing the workshops.

272
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:18,422
And I realized women
didn't know their own body.

273
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:42,404
We don't have many examples
of what a real vagina... vulva.

274
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,448
Excuse me, pardon me. Vulva, vulva, vulva.

275
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:46,134
- [Betty] Very good.
- [Gwyneth] Thank you.

276
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,868
- What it looks like.
- No.

277
00:13:47,952 --> 00:13:52,164
The theory of the workshop,
it's to get women, first vulnerable...

278
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,333
- [Betty] Yes.
- Comfortable in their body,

279
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,461
- comfortable with their vulva.
- Mm-hmm.

280
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,755
It's gonna be hard to try that word on

281
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,090
- and use it.
- I know. Vulva.

282
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:02,341
Vulva, vulva.

283
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:06,178
[Carlin] So I think the most important
ritual on day one

284
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:07,346
is genital show and tell.

285
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,225
And I think if you say,
"Okay, I'm gonna sit next to Betty Dodson,

286
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:13,787
and I'm gonna look at my vulva,
and everyone else is gonna look,

287
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:14,687
and you think, "Oh, my God."

288
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,815
- [laughs] What could be scarier than that?
- Right.

289
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:19,692
[laughing]

290
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,237
[Betty] So now we're sitting
with our genitals exposed.

291
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,240
No more hiding,
no more shame, no more guilt.

292
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,075
This is our power spot.

293
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,619
Come on, this is the next generation
comes from us.

294
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:34,456
Thinking about the people
who are watching the show wondering,

295
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:38,043
"Are they gonna show the vulva?"
Like, is this gonna happen?

296
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:42,423
- [laughing]
- And you think about the discomfort

297
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,926
that's going to start swelling
in people's bodies

298
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,261
at just the mere...

299
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:49,471
- I think even that...
- The thought of it.

300
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:51,181
It's just terrifying to people.

301
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:53,309
And then to get through that.

302
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,727
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

303
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:57,855
So, now we're gonna look at it
under the light.

304
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:03,152
Get a good shot. Oh, perfect.

305
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,195
Isn't that beautiful?

306
00:15:05,821 --> 00:15:06,655
It is.

307
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:12,328
What we're talking about
is this deep resistance we have to

308
00:15:12,578 --> 00:15:15,706
- our own genitalia, culturally speaking.
- [Elise] Yeah.

309
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:18,667
It is really time for that to change.

310
00:15:19,251 --> 00:15:20,461
You've looked before.

311
00:15:20,544 --> 00:15:21,544
I have.

312
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:24,506
- You have to be able to see it.
- Right.

313
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,675
That's the whole point.
Why can't we see it?

314
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,679
- We see penises all the time.
- [Gwyneth] Right.

315
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,679
- We sure do.
- Yeah, seriously.

316
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,514
[laughing]

317
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,809
See the shape and see the form.

318
00:15:36,685 --> 00:15:37,685
Wonderful.

319
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,147
[Carlin] So, I do groom a little.

320
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,734
What's so interesting here
is that you've got this pattern.

321
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:46,236
It's like an arrow, like...
[exclaims, laughs]

322
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,697
This is my clitoral hood...

323
00:15:49,239 --> 00:15:51,408
and my clitoris isn't super big.

324
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:53,953
- [Betty] It's the glans.
- There's the glans right there.

325
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,245
- Oh.
- Mmm.

326
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,414
That's where it's all taking place, kid.

327
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,667
But you'd have to show more than one,

328
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:02,127
because if you only showed one,

329
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:04,296
that would become the one.

330
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,881
We'd all imitate it.

331
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,175
Shana, start filming more vulvas.

332
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,593
- [Elise] Yeah.
- [Shana] On it!

333
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,261
[laughing]

334
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:13,472
[Betty] So you need to show a variety.

335
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,224
[Carlin] Yeah, to see that image...

336
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:18,018
In that moment,
you know you're not alone.

337
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,142
There's nothing wrong with you.
How healing is that?

338
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,481
'Cause you can go,
"Oh, that looks like mine."

339
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:25,317
- [Elise] Yeah.
- We always think there's something wrong.

340
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,987
- [Elise] Hmm.
- So they get to find out that,

341
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:31,657
indeed, their vulva's perfect,
and they're all different.

342
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,201
- But it's one thing just to look.
- [Gwyneth] Right.

343
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:39,123
But it's also about being knowledgeable
about your body.

344
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:43,419
And then beyond that,
with the connection to pleasure,

345
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,213
is the workshop teaching women

346
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,257
how to have an orgasm
because they don't...

347
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:50,020
[Carlin] Yeah,
how to stimulate themselves.

348
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:52,529
We always say with the workshops,
"You're together, but alone."

349
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,930
So you're supported,
you're in a safe environment,

350
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:57,224
and this is really about
making it fun and playful.

351
00:16:57,307 --> 00:17:01,228
You know, too often when we're having
any kind of sex experience,

352
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:03,373
- it's always so serious for women.
- [Gwyneth] Mm-hmm.

353
00:17:03,397 --> 00:17:05,077
You're always worried about
so many things.

354
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:06,525
Right.

355
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:09,069
[Elise] Men have been fed this lie

356
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:13,115
that women should just be able
to get there or that it should be easier,

357
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,575
that it doesn't require work.

358
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:17,578
That can be shocking for a lot of women,
that orgasm is work.

359
00:17:17,661 --> 00:17:18,996
We hear that a lot.

360
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,849
- "I should just orgasm, it's natural."
- Yeah.

361
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:22,666
And I think women have probably fed that

362
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:27,171
by performing potentially in a fake way.

363
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:28,713
[Gwyneth] Right.

364
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:33,052
Do you guys know what
performative receiving is?

365
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:34,135
No.

366
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:36,388
[Isabella]
Something that usually only women do.

367
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:39,892
It is a way that you either accentuate

368
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,685
or completely fake your pleasure,

369
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:44,146
and I'm not talking about
faking your orgasms,

370
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,107
and if anyone does that,
please this is the last day

371
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,526
that you've ever done that
in your entire life.

372
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:53,072
It is like leaving a breadcrumb trail
to your partner

373
00:17:53,155 --> 00:17:54,531
of what doesn't turn you on.

374
00:17:54,865 --> 00:17:57,451
And it's okay to not have
an orgasm every time.

375
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:00,037
Instead, we can have
a really lovely conversation.

376
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,456
"Yes, this part felt really good.

377
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:04,666
I would love to experience you
doing more of that.

378
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,961
This other part, mmm, maybe not so much."

379
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:11,632
Which is why we're gonna do
our next exercise, which is massage.

380
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,675
You can choose hand or feet.

381
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:15,719
You're gonna communicate what you like

382
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,805
and you're gonna negotiate consent.

383
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,432
It smells so good.

384
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,977
I like when you pull down on my fingers
and open my joints.

385
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:26,063
I think it feels really good on my joints.

386
00:18:26,146 --> 00:18:28,440
- I'm gonna do one by one.
- Yeah, like that.

387
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,025
[Isabella] And in a sexual context,

388
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,628
you could say something
along the lines of,

389
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:32,986
"That last move you were doing,

390
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,910
or that last technique
was feeling really good.

391
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:36,281
Could we go back to that?"

392
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:38,867
Would you like a hand massage?

393
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:39,952
Yeah, let's do hands.

394
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:41,203
I'm very ticklish.

395
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,622
I might need a little bit more oil.

396
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:46,708
[Isabella] That's beautiful.
Good communication.

397
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:50,045
We can't receive pleasure
that we don't ask for.

398
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:53,882
Does it feel as good on the top like this
as on the sides?

399
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:57,094
- I like the top. Yeah.
- Like this one, okay.

400
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:00,931
Just being in sex
and thinking to yourself,

401
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:03,267
"Oh, I wish my partner was doing X, Y, Z,"

402
00:19:03,350 --> 00:19:05,477
is not gonna make your partner do X, Y, Z.

403
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:06,687
They can't read your mind.

404
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:11,358
It is so vitally important
that you communicate your needs.

405
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,819
We can do this in such a loving way.

406
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,779
You guys are modeling it so beautifully.

407
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,533
The massage exercise was...
was pretty awesome

408
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:23,287
because it doesn't seem so crazy
or important,

409
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,664
but you realize that
to get the result you want,

410
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:27,147
you actually have to say something.

411
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:29,376
There's no magic person in the world

412
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:31,712
who knows what you want
and who can read your mind.

413
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:34,715
So it's just, it's good food for thought.

414
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,135
- [laughing] Thanks, Lexi.
- Namaste.

415
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:41,180
- Namaste. My hands feel so much better.
- [laughs] Namaste.

416
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:47,853
Besides not knowing our bodies,
which I am absolutely guilty of,

417
00:19:47,936 --> 00:19:51,982
I have never really done the whole mirror,
what's happening down there.

418
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,358
You've never seen yourself?

419
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,483
No.

420
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:58,197
- [Betty] Come over here.
- [laughing]

421
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,323
I'm wearing a skirt.

422
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:02,618
But I think that I also have done work

423
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,871
to understand that I deserve pleasure,

424
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,248
and that pleasure is not shameful.

425
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:09,875
Do you feel like you deserve pleasure?

426
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:15,005
The idea that women
inherently deserve pleasure,

427
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:18,050
I feel like I'm just, at 46 years old,

428
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:21,094
- starting to knit that together.
- [Carlin] Mm-hmm.

429
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:23,513
But I think I was very much raised
in an era

430
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:27,559
where it was very much about the guy

431
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:31,605
and trying to look good for the guy
and do what the guy wanted,

432
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:33,288
like be the cool girl, you know, that...

433
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,901
Well, and now you're... you've always...

434
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:40,030
since you were 18,
been a universal sex symbol.

435
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:40,989
- Well.
- [laughing]

436
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:43,992
But you have to live up to that
in the bedroom, I'm sure, yeah.

437
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:47,204
Which is so...
it must be the weirdest experience.

438
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:51,291
[stammering] I think that I shut that out.

439
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,378
'Cause it's a fiction, right?
It's all a projection.

440
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,798
It's really nothing to do with me
or the quality of who I am

441
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:00,133
or the good things about me
or the bad things about me

442
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,468
or my own sexuality.

443
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:03,595
It's like, it's all a projection.

444
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:06,223
So, I feel very almost divorced

445
00:21:06,306 --> 00:21:08,850
- from having that kind of pressure.
- Mm-hmm.

446
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,270
But maybe when I was younger,
I probably did.

447
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:12,353
[Elise] Yeah.

448
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:17,651
[Isabella] We've been talking a lot
about vulnerability, intimacy.

449
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:21,321
It's so much more comfortable
for people to disconnect

450
00:21:21,405 --> 00:21:22,656
than it is to connect.

451
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:25,033
So, we're gonna do some eye gazing.

452
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,703
This is a no talking exercise.

453
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,705
It's really important that you don't talk.

454
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,582
We're gonna be looking
into each other's left eye.

455
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,876
Your left side is your feminine.

456
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,253
It's your receiving.

457
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,714
If you need to laugh, if you need to cry,

458
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:41,466
you can let it out
as long as it's not talking.

459
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:42,843
Let's get started.

460
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:38,273
- How did that feel for everybody?
- [sighing]

461
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:39,816
- Um...
- It was weird.

462
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,377
- I don't know why I cried.
- [Isabella] It was weird?

463
00:22:41,401 --> 00:22:42,277
[Megan] It was hard.

464
00:22:42,361 --> 00:22:44,863
It's hard to look at someone in the eye.

465
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:47,824
- You feel exposed, and you want to laugh.
- Yeah.

466
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,910
- Mm-hmm.
- And you just... It's uncomfortable.

467
00:22:49,993 --> 00:22:53,163
[Isabella] Just that really being seen
that deeply.

468
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:54,331
Yeah.

469
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:57,584
- [Lexi] I don't know why I feel emotional.
- [Megan] You weren't sad.

470
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,462
- You were just emotional.
- I wasn't sad. No, it wasn't a sad moment,

471
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:04,216
and I didn't want you to freak out
or anything as I was looking.

472
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:06,426
- I was like, "What is she feeling?"
- [laughs]

473
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:08,261
But that made me
feel more connected to you,

474
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:10,972
'cause, like, I had empathy for you.

475
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:13,058
In my mind, I was telling you

476
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:16,561
it's okay to, like, let it out
and, like, just...

477
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,231
Yeah, it was... it was great.

478
00:23:20,315 --> 00:23:22,943
Some of the activities at Belle's workshop

479
00:23:23,026 --> 00:23:24,444
were very uncomfortable to me,

480
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,447
but it did make me realize

481
00:23:27,531 --> 00:23:31,618
how important it is to be vulnerable,

482
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:33,120
be out of my comfort zone,

483
00:23:33,203 --> 00:23:36,540
to communicate and practice
with my partner in different ways

484
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:38,917
to enhance our intimacy,

485
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,003
even if I feel awkward sometimes.

486
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:46,925
I love how you said the sort of discomfort
of not knowing how she was feeling.

487
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:49,219
It's really nice to be comfortable

488
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:52,013
in the discomfort of not knowing
how our partners

489
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:54,057
or our friends or our parents feel.

490
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:56,977
And reassuring yourself
that you're rock solid

491
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:58,854
in who you are and how you feel.

492
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:03,024
[Lexi]
I think I got some really great takeaways

493
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:06,528
on how to communicate with my partner
from the workshop,

494
00:24:06,653 --> 00:24:10,031
and now I think I need
to figure out my own body

495
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,159
and what makes me feel good.

496
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:17,539
So, I asked goop if I could go visit
Betty Dodson in New York City.

497
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:27,257
So I heard that Lexi,

498
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,760
one of our star employees, came to you.

499
00:24:31,261 --> 00:24:32,554
What was her experience?

500
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,098
When she came in,
she was definitely shaking like a leaf.

501
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:36,182
Yeah.

502
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,063
Hello.

503
00:24:46,401 --> 00:24:47,401
[Carlin] Lexi.

504
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:49,237
- Hi, Carlin.
- You made it.

505
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,948
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- It's a pleasure.

506
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:53,074
Thank you for coming.

507
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:54,576
Yeah, thanks for having me.

508
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:55,660
- Betty.
- Hello.

509
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:57,913
Legendary Betty Dodson.

510
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,118
- You're a tall girl.
- Hi. It's so nice to meet you.

511
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:02,417
Now I've been seeing you guys on YouTube,

512
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:05,670
- so I'm like very... yeah, it's an honor.
- [Dodson chatters]

513
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:08,006
It's an honor to meet you guys in person.

514
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:12,135
When I first heard goop
was going to do the docu-series

515
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,721
on this topic,
sexuality and female pleasure,

516
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:16,932
that's a topic I was more interested in.

517
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,141
I grew up in Shanghai.

518
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:23,605
When I grew up, it's not even okay
to like openly talk about sex,

519
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:24,981
for girls especially,

520
00:25:25,065 --> 00:25:28,026
and it's not okay to be, like, sexual.

521
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:31,404
I don't think I explore my body that much.

522
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,740
I feel like it was shameful
to talk about, even.

523
00:25:33,823 --> 00:25:36,409
- Now I'm on camera talking about it
- [laughing]

524
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:39,454
in front of millions of people,
which is great.

525
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:42,791
- [Carlin] Liberated.
- [laughs] Exactly. That's my journey.

526
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,794
I want everybody who are like me

527
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:49,089
or who grew up
in a more conservative culture

528
00:25:49,172 --> 00:25:50,757
or even grew up here...

529
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,676
You know what, that's everyone,
right, Betty?

530
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,302
When we have women in the workshops,

531
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,763
there's no country in the world
that encourages girls

532
00:25:56,846 --> 00:25:59,057
to explore themselves and their sexuality.

533
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,225
Doesn't exist.

534
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:03,019
We shut them down with the beauty myth
and the slut stigma

535
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:04,646
- and the virginity myth.
- Right.

536
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,314
Like, it doesn't exist.

537
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,607
Yeah, that's why I'm here.

538
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:11,444
- And learn how to masturbate.
- [Betty] Yay!

539
00:26:13,572 --> 00:26:16,658
[Gwyneth] How many different kinds
of orgasm are there?

540
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,421
Is it true that there are different kinds?

541
00:26:18,493 --> 00:26:20,787
Yes. The tension orgasm. [gasps]

542
00:26:20,912 --> 00:26:23,915
[Carlin] That's what most people do.
I tense up, and I hold my breath,

543
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:25,041
- and then I cum.
- Right.

544
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:28,461
Or we call it the "Rock 'n Roll,"
where you...[panting]

545
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,046
That's Betty's technique.

546
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:34,843
You're breathing and moving,
and you're using your body naturally.

547
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,989
So how does that work?

548
00:26:56,072 --> 00:26:57,365
You lie on your back...

549
00:26:57,824 --> 00:26:59,618
And you rock?

550
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,578
- [laughing]
- Side to side?

551
00:27:01,661 --> 00:27:03,204
- Rock.
- You rock your pelvis.

552
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:05,516
- So basically, your legs, it's like...
- [Betty] Pelvis forward.

553
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,417
- [laughing]
- ...your feet are on the floor

554
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,544
- and your legs are opened.
- [Gwyneth] Okay.

555
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:11,338
And you're rocking your pelvis forward

556
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,923
and when you come up,
you squeeze your PC... [inhales]

557
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:15,568
take a breath and then [exhales]
...that's it.

558
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,094
While you're having sex
or with a vibrator?

559
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:21,139
With a vibrator, but that will also
translate into partner sex.

560
00:27:21,222 --> 00:27:22,515
If you're working that PC,

561
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:24,452
you're gonna get more blood
into your sex organ.

562
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:25,935
What is "working a PC" mean?

563
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,354
The pelvic floor muscle.

564
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:28,956
- You're sitting on it.
- [Gwyneth] Right.

565
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,565
All right, now lift up...

566
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:33,735
release.

567
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:36,363
- That is the pelvic floor muscle.
- [Gwyneth] Lift up.

568
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:39,783
Lift up, squeeze it, then let it go.

569
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,368
- Squeeze and release.
- Okay.

570
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:44,996
- I'm doing it. Get with the program.
- [laughing]

571
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,541
Elise has a full Kegel workout
in her routine.

572
00:27:48,625 --> 00:27:50,168
I'm working it right now.

573
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:52,921
And remember, it's supposed to be fun

574
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:55,340
- [Gwyneth] Yes.
- and playful and feel good.

575
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:01,262
During erotic recess,
we start off with me and Betty,

576
00:28:01,346 --> 00:28:04,391
and we demonstrate your
Rock 'n Roll orgasm technique,

577
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:08,353
and that's where we show you how
to combine clitoral stimulation

578
00:28:08,436 --> 00:28:11,648
- with vaginal penetration.
- And the rocking.

579
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:14,150
[Carlin] So this is your
internal clitoris.

580
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:15,994
- A beautiful sex organ.
- [Lexi] Oh, my God.

581
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,758
[Carlin] This would be
your clitoral glans.

582
00:28:26,788 --> 00:28:27,706
[Lexi] Mm-hmm.

583
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,458
And that's the little clit that you see
on the outside.

584
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,545
[Carlin] That's what most people
are touching that they say is sensitive,

585
00:28:33,628 --> 00:28:35,839
but you have an internal clitoral system.

586
00:28:35,922 --> 00:28:37,590
It's very complex.

587
00:28:37,674 --> 00:28:40,427
These are the legs of the clitoris,

588
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,387
the bulbs of the clitoris.

589
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,432
We have as much erectile tissue as men.

590
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:47,392
We just have internal erections.

591
00:28:47,475 --> 00:28:50,645
Your clitoral glans
has 8,000 nerve endings.

592
00:28:51,521 --> 00:28:53,732
- [sing-songy] More than a penis.
- [laughs]

593
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,443
You're gonna be working your PC,
getting blood in there,

594
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:58,403
then you'll have your vibrator
on your clit.

595
00:28:58,486 --> 00:29:01,239
[inhales] You're breathing,
you're rocking your pelvis.

596
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:03,658
It's a workout, but once you get going,

597
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:06,953
it's gonna take what,
20 to 40 minutes for most women?

598
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:10,749
Well, you can pop right off immediately.

599
00:29:10,832 --> 00:29:13,293
So you learn to stretch it out

600
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:16,004
- 'cause the longer you have a build up,
- [Lexi] Mm-hmm.

601
00:29:16,087 --> 00:29:18,131
- the bigger the orgasm.
- [Carlin] Yeah.

602
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:22,218
Do you think orgasm is important,
or do you think it's that sort of...

603
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,345
Abso-fucking-lutely!

604
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:27,140
[laughing]

605
00:29:27,223 --> 00:29:30,977
Do you wanna go... [pants]
in front of a sneeze and then not sneeze?

606
00:29:31,895 --> 00:29:35,690
Mnh-mnh.
It's a natural function of the body.

607
00:29:36,232 --> 00:29:40,945
Do you think that orgasm plays a role
in women's health?

608
00:29:41,571 --> 00:29:42,571
Absolutely.

609
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:52,832
[softly buzzing]

610
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:54,375
[Carlin] This is the Magic Wand.

611
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:57,295
This does not replace your partner,

612
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,506
- male or female, it does not.
- No.

613
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:00,882
It's an enhancement.

614
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,176
In the beginning, the guy's all... [gasps]

615
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:06,071
- [Lexi] Right. They're like, "Oh."
- They think this was for penetration.

616
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:09,474
Or even women, there are lesbian purists
that don't like vibrators.

617
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:12,936
This is used on the outside
for clitoral stimulation.

618
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,079
- What we...
- Get the barbell.

619
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:16,981
...use for penetration, this is...
Betty designed this.

620
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,734
It's a pound
of medical-grade stainless steel.

621
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:20,944
It's the vaginal barbell.

622
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:23,202
So what's nice about it
is when you insert it,

623
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,615
when you squeeze
your pelvic floor muscle,

624
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,700
it doesn't shoot out. It stays.

625
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,220
And what you'll notice and you'll see

626
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:30,930
- is when you flex your muscle...
- The weight.

627
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:32,205
The weight holds it in.

628
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:33,288
It moves.

629
00:30:33,373 --> 00:30:35,625
So, it gives the women a visual

630
00:30:35,708 --> 00:30:38,211
that your vagina
and your pelvic floor muscle

631
00:30:38,294 --> 00:30:40,213
- is a very complicated sex organ.
- Mm-hmm.

632
00:30:40,296 --> 00:30:41,398
[Carlin] It's not just a hole.

633
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:44,342
So, you always say
it's clitoral stimulation with vaginal...

634
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,070
- [Lexi] Both at the same time.
- Penetration.

635
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:49,264
- Yes.
- I never wanna stop doing the workshops.

636
00:30:49,347 --> 00:30:51,575
- And here I am this naked, little old lady
- And you look 60.

637
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:54,769
- with her vibrator. [imitates vibrating]
- [laughing]

638
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:58,439
Maybe that's how it keeps you young.
That's how, yeah, that's how it works.

639
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,043
- Pleasure can't be bad.
- [Lexi] Yeah.

640
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:02,235
Yeah, it can't be bad for you.

641
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:06,239
[Gwyneth] Do you think that there's
almost a responsibility

642
00:31:06,322 --> 00:31:10,159
- to show, like, what actually happens
- [Carlin] Oh, yeah.

643
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:12,287
and the beauty of a female orgasm?

644
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:15,415
[Carlin]
Yes. And to see how other women orgasm.

645
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:17,292
Not the stuff you hear on pornography,

646
00:31:17,375 --> 00:31:19,711
not the stuff you see
on the Hollywood movies,

647
00:31:19,794 --> 00:31:21,337
which is fake and not real.

648
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:26,217
In porn, men are, like, doing it
and women are just cumming, right?

649
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:28,428
- [Carlin] Yes.
- That's the mythology of porn?

650
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:59,834
There's no, like, reference of what
a real orgasm looks like out there.

651
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:02,462
Do you think by being
sort of explicit about it,

652
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:06,716
we can help women reframe
what that experience is?

653
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:11,596
Yes. If you could show a real live orgasm,

654
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,140
it would be groundbreaking.

655
00:32:14,641 --> 00:32:16,726
You had kind of a one-on-one workshop?

656
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:19,270
Yes, we did a one-on-one with me,

657
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:23,024
and I could see Lexi watching everything
in the viewfinder.

658
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:26,194
And we went through the Rock 'n Roll
masturbation technique,

659
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:29,364
and I knew if we were gonna do it,
you have to go all the way, right?

660
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:32,742
And you have to have an orgasm,
so it's intimidating when you have a crew.

661
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:34,994
Oh, my God. I can't believe you did it.

662
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,078
- That's amazing. It's so brave.
- [Carlin] I know!

663
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:39,666
- Somebody had to.
- Right.

664
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:42,835
[Betty]
Okay, we're gonna do the Rock 'n Roll.

665
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:43,919
Thank you.

666
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,049
[Betty] Hand over hand.

667
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,195
- [Carlin] You think of, like, feminism.
- [Elise] Yeah.

668
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,930
Any time we took a step forward
towards equality,

669
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:56,516
it meant someone had to put it
on the line.

670
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:57,599
[Betty] Always.

671
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,061
Oh, I want you to take hold of it.

672
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,564
Yeah, just put it at the mouth
of the vagina,

673
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,648
just hold it there.

674
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:09,737
- Take a nice deep breath...
- [inhales]

675
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,906
- [exhales]
- and then relax.

676
00:33:14,784 --> 00:33:17,620
[Gwyneth]
What is the inherent danger in a woman

677
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:21,124
being integrated with her sexuality?

678
00:33:21,457 --> 00:33:23,738
When you're in touch with your body
and you love your body

679
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:27,046
and you can give yourself an orgasm,
you're independent.

680
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,424
You know who you are.
You know what you want.

681
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:32,593
We're very dangerous
when we're knowledgeable.

682
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:34,303
Tell me about it.

683
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:35,930
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

684
00:33:36,014 --> 00:33:38,599
- Grip the muscles, feel the weight.
- [exhaling]

685
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,686
You got a good strong PC muscle, kid.

686
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:42,770
Thank you.

687
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:44,147
Okay, it's all the way in.

688
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,399
- All the way in. Oh, good.
- Mm-hmm.

689
00:33:47,108 --> 00:33:49,819
- You're working the pelvic floor muscle,
- [inhaling, exhaling]

690
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:52,321
breathing, rocking, squeezing.

691
00:33:53,156 --> 00:33:54,156
That's it.

692
00:33:54,949 --> 00:34:00,246
I watched the one-on-one
body sex coaching session

693
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:01,831
with Betty and Carlin.

694
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,710
[Betty] That's it. Let it all go.

695
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:11,674
Deep breath. Squeeze. Release.

696
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:15,470
[Lexi] I didn't know what to expect,
but when I was actually seeing it,

697
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:19,265
it was such a beautiful moment

698
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:22,894
when Betty was coaching Carlin

699
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:25,021
how to do the body movement,

700
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,939
those breathing techniques...

701
00:34:27,023 --> 00:34:30,109
- [inhaling, exhaling]
- [vibrator buzzing]

702
00:34:30,193 --> 00:34:31,193
[Betty] Beautiful.

703
00:34:32,528 --> 00:34:34,989
The biggest thing that I've learned today

704
00:34:35,531 --> 00:34:38,242
is that no matter who you are,

705
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:42,497
what culture you grew up in,
what country you're from,

706
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:44,874
who you identify yourself as,

707
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:49,796
it's not about you
with anyone else around you.

708
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:52,924
It's about you owning your own body.

709
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:58,221
You having a healthy,
positive relationship with your body.

710
00:34:58,596 --> 00:34:59,972
Owning your own pleasure.

711
00:35:01,891 --> 00:35:03,935
[Carlin moaning]

712
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:11,943
[moaning continuing]

713
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,237
[sighs]

714
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:17,115
[exhales]

715
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,537
Okay, that was fun. [laughs]

716
00:35:23,079 --> 00:35:24,079
[Betty] Beautiful.

717
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:28,501
- Cut.
- [laughing, applauding]

718
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:31,003
[Carlin] All right, all right. You got it?

719
00:35:31,087 --> 00:35:33,589
[woman] Oh, my God.
Well done. That was incredible.

720
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:35,675
[theme music playing]
