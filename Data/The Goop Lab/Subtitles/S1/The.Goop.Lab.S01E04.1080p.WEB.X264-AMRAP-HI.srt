1
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:09,676
When I started goop in 2008,
I was like,

2
00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:11,928
"My calling is something else besides,
you know,

3
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,472
making out with Matt Damon onscreen
or whatever."

4
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:15,556
[laughs]

5
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,436
And now, it's this modern lifestyle brand.

6
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:24,024
To me, it's all laddering up to one thing,
which is optimization of self.

7
00:00:24,107 --> 00:00:26,192
Like, we're here one time, one life...

8
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,112
How can we really, like,
milk the shit out of this?

9
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,196
[laughing]

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:32,532
You have a hundred needles
in your face, Elise.

11
00:00:32,615 --> 00:00:34,826
- [chuckling]
- Just another day at the office.

12
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:37,495
The opportunity that we have
with the goop lab

13
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,665
is that, as a company,
we can go out in different groups

14
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,918
and go on a much deeper dive
into some of these topics

15
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,712
that our readers are curious about.

16
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:48,089
- [laughing]
- This is gonna be my first experience

17
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:49,442
- with mushrooms.
- [Gillian] Oh!

18
00:00:49,466 --> 00:00:51,593
- [exhales]
- [woman] You have to let go of your ego.

19
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,112
[Gwyneth] So, what happens in a workshop?

20
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,679
- Everyone gets off.
- [woman moaning]

21
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,848
What the fuck are you doing to people?

22
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,183
[man vocalizing]

23
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:02,228
We get to explore, like,
is this real? Do we feel better?

24
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:05,148
And grapple with some topics
that are hard

25
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,816
and embarrassing or shameful.

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,318
Isn't that beautiful?

27
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,694
- [sighs]
- [woman 2] Relax.

28
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,696
That was, like, next level shit.

29
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,076
So, are you guys ready to go out
in the field and make a ruckus?

30
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,161
- [Elise] Yeah.
- You can handle it, right?

31
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,871
[laughing]

32
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,671
[sighs]

33
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:29,755
[Apple] Hi.

34
00:01:30,256 --> 00:01:31,257
Hi.

35
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:34,636
- [Apple] How are you doing?
- I feel terrible.

36
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:38,056
[Apple]
Daffo, do you wanna do the cleanse?

37
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:40,141
I had a burrito for dinner.

38
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,810
Believe me, I'm aware.

39
00:01:41,893 --> 00:01:44,646
- I was salivating over it.
- [laughing]

40
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:46,189
[Apple] I mean, you were salivating

41
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:48,358
when I was describing
to you my chia pudding,

42
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:50,110
what I'm gonna eat tomorrow, so...

43
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:52,445
- I'm dying for chia pudding.
- That's...

44
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,949
Nothing has ever sounded more decadent
or delicious to me.

45
00:01:58,368 --> 00:02:01,162
Ready to show the world
what it looks to turn 50?

46
00:02:01,246 --> 00:02:02,622
Oh, God. [laughing]

47
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:05,375
What? This is not fair at all.

48
00:02:05,458 --> 00:02:08,086
[Morgan Levine] You can make yourself
younger on the inside.

49
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,849
You're probably gonna
look younger as well.

50
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,172
I'm upping the stakes.

51
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:14,384
- It's my one chance trying to be younger.
- [laughing]

52
00:02:14,467 --> 00:02:17,887
What about these women who can,
like, run marathons at 80?

53
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,264
- [woman] <i>Golden Girls.</i>
- Yeah.

54
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:22,058
Blanche got laid more in her 70s
than I did in my 20s.

55
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:25,311
I guess you never knew this was gonna be
part of your job title, right? [laughs]

56
00:02:25,395 --> 00:02:26,980
Oh, my God.

57
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:28,398
[gasps]

58
00:02:35,238 --> 00:02:36,238
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you,

59
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,961
- Valter Longo.
- Nice to meet you, Valter.

60
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:40,827
- Hi. I'm Morgan. Nice to meet you.
- Hi, Morgan, how are you?

61
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:45,165
I think people everywhere
are incredibly concerned

62
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:48,585
with their appearance
and how they're aging physically.

63
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,128
[Valter] Yeah, absolutely.

64
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:53,840
The medical system worldwide
has really been stuck on this,

65
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:57,135
"Let's wait until somebody has a disease."
And then we start treating them.

66
00:02:57,218 --> 00:03:00,638
And we've been saying,
"Treat aging, extend health span,

67
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,973
you know, extend youth."

68
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:12,692
The problem, I think, with nutrition
is being that

69
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,903
- it never came as a medicine.
- [Gwyneth] Mm-hmm

70
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:19,115
And really, this is what I worked
30 years almost for is...

71
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:22,327
what can a doctor actually give you

72
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,788
that allows the person to live longer,
healthier?

73
00:03:25,872 --> 00:03:28,917
- Right.
- It's also gonna help in the long run.

74
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,960
So, if you can do stuff that we know

75
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:33,922
is going to decrease the risk
of different chronic diseases,

76
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:36,925
then people can kind of figure out
what interventions work for them,

77
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:40,261
postponing the incidence
of these different diseases longer.

78
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:42,055
Morgan, what's your background?

79
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:44,724
Mostly in, kind of, bio-statistics

80
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:48,186
and basically how can we actually
measure the aging process,

81
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,813
and it's a very complex process.

82
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,024
There's so many different things
going on in aging.

83
00:03:53,107 --> 00:03:55,526
So, really, how can we understand

84
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:58,321
at the entire kind of person level

85
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,281
and within each cell.

86
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:08,331
We're finding that your biological age

87
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,209
is more predictive of your mortality risk,

88
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:14,545
your risk of developing cancer,
heart disease, diabetes,

89
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,797
than your chronological age.

90
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,131
How fascinating.

91
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:22,720
So, we each kind of went
through an experiment,

92
00:04:23,304 --> 00:04:27,934
and we each had a blood test
before we did varying protocols.

93
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,147
- Oh, dear,
- Oh, dear.

94
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,358
- Oh, my. Hi.
- Hi.

95
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,609
[Elise] Kim, this is Gwyneth.

96
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,569
- [Gwyneth] Hi, how are you?
- How are you?

97
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,413
- Good, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

98
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:42,657
- Just another day at the office.
- [chuckling]

99
00:04:51,499 --> 00:04:54,335
This skirt is, like, inappropriately short

100
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:58,464
for someone who's old enough
to be testing their biological age.

101
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:02,677
- [laughing]
- Your dress code age is 18.

102
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:06,180
Whenever someone asks me how old I am,

103
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:11,936
I never think that the answer's
gonna contain a "4."

104
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:15,231
I feel like I was just used to being
in my 30s and...

105
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,232
[Elise] Yeah.

106
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,068
'Cause in my mind,
I was 28 for a really long time.

107
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,529
I was really excited to be in my 30s.

108
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:24,324
30s are good, 40s are way better.

109
00:05:24,407 --> 00:05:26,784
I don't know.
I think that idea that you're letting go

110
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:30,621
of being identified as, like,

111
00:05:31,789 --> 00:05:34,000
a woman of childbearing age.

112
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:38,755
And, like, we live in a culture where
that's such a critical component, right?

113
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:43,509
What comes with a lot of that is,
I think we're in that game unconsciously.

114
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:46,304
And then, I don't know, something happens
when you turn 40.

115
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:48,097
You just sort of don't really give a fuck,

116
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:52,143
and for me, it was, like, increb...
incredibly liberating.

117
00:05:55,313 --> 00:05:56,439
[Elise] I'd better win.

118
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:58,900
- [laughing]
- You'd better because you're the youngest.

119
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:02,320
I hope I win, as the eldest.

120
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,072
Are you excited to be 50?

121
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,116
- Hmm. Not really.
- [Elise] No? Why?

122
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,452
I... I'm torn.

123
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,246
Isn't it hard, like, until you get there
and then you're like,

124
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:15,750
"Oh, actually, this is kind of great"?
Like, I freaked out before I turned 40

125
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,377
and then I was like, "This is great."

126
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:21,506
Yeah, the lead up
is more anxiety provoking.

127
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:27,136
I basically have been running off
no sleep, coffee, and alcohol

128
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,638
for, like, two years.

129
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:32,016
I think my adrenals
are gonna explode after this.

130
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,519
- [chuckling]
- You'll come to retake my biological age,

131
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,354
and I'll be deceased.

132
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:38,314
[laughing]

133
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:42,360
What are the factors
that determines somebody's biological age?

134
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,779
So, for biological age,
when we measure it,

135
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:48,491
we try and make sure that we're covering
a lot of different systems in the body,

136
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:52,537
so we can really get an idea
of the overall age of the person.

137
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,124
So, we have a measure
for inflammation, metabolism,

138
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:59,252
kidney and liver function,
cardiovascular health.

139
00:06:59,335 --> 00:07:02,547
And it's really kind of how those combine

140
00:07:02,630 --> 00:07:05,925
to create your overall health
or biological profile.

141
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,050
Well...

142
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:10,680
- How old are we?
- [laughing]

143
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:12,432
I want to know.

144
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,660
- Do you know? Because we...
- [Morgan] Okay. I do know, yeah.

145
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:15,935
I'm so scared.

146
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:18,438
You all were younger biologically
than chronologically.

147
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:21,232
- So, yeah.
- How much?

148
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:22,900
- So, Wendy,
- Yes.

149
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:26,279
you were 48.4 biologically.

150
00:07:26,362 --> 00:07:27,280
Okay.

151
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:28,531
48.4?

152
00:07:28,614 --> 00:07:31,784
Yes, and I don't know if you want
to reveal your chronological age.

153
00:07:31,868 --> 00:07:34,078
- 49.
- [Morgan] Yeah, 49 and a half, right?

154
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:35,973
- Okay, thank you, I don't need that.
- I'll give you the half.

155
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,915
No, I mean, the decimals matter.

156
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:41,586
- Elise, you were 37.9.
- Whoo!

157
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:42,920
How old are you now?

158
00:07:43,045 --> 00:07:45,298
Thirty-nine and a half?

159
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:48,050
And, Gwyneth, you were 44.2.

160
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:52,346
- 44.2, how old am I? 46.
- Yeah

161
00:08:01,772 --> 00:08:04,442
[Gwyneth] Yum! Why didn't I get that one?

162
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:06,903
- I have never been vegan.
- I have never been vegan.

163
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:09,739
I've never been vegan, either.
People think I've been vegan.

164
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,702
- I know. Right.
- People still think I'm vegan.

165
00:08:18,789 --> 00:08:20,208
I get the stinky one.

166
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:27,048
I'm going super Mediterranean,

167
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,718
so I think the idea is pescatarian,
primarily vegan.

168
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,721
[Gwyneth]
But it's the same thing you eat anyway.

169
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:36,432
Well, normally, I try to eat some red meat
and I eat poultry.

170
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,856
[Elise]
Are you ready for your diet, oldie?

171
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,941
I'm ready.

172
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:49,028
Let's see what my life is gonna consist of
for five days.

173
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,279
Wow.

174
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,408
This is all the food?

175
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,203
- [Elise] Yeah.
- You must be joking?

176
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:59,163
It's actually kind of nice.

177
00:08:59,247 --> 00:09:01,225
'Cause you don't have to think about
what you're gonna eat

178
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:04,001
'cause it's all in a packet.
It's like astronaut food.

179
00:09:04,085 --> 00:09:06,879
You guys put me through, like,
the craziest shit.

180
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:08,123
[Elise] You know you love it.

181
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,305
[Gwyneth] All right, let's see.
I imag... Is this is breakfast?

182
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:19,392
Okay, I've got an L-Bar, a nut-based bar.

183
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:21,644
I got some kale crackers, people.

184
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:27,692
I've got the, of course,
the requisite NR-1 vegetable powder.

185
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:30,528
- [Elise chuckling]
- Spearmint-lemon tea. Great.

186
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:34,407
Olives, that's fun.
I'm already excited for that.

187
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:35,366
And two soups.

188
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:38,011
- So, I guess this would be lunch, yeah?
- [Elise] Lunch and dinner, yeah.

189
00:09:38,035 --> 00:09:40,538
- This should be okay.
- [Elise] You're fine. You'll be fine.

190
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:43,781
- But then it gets less food every day?
- It's a little bit less food every day.

191
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,961
- Well, I'll certainly be a cheap date.
- [laughing]

192
00:09:48,045 --> 00:09:49,672
My kids are gonna bum out.

193
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:52,717
Every time I do a cleanse,
they're like, "Oh, no."

194
00:09:53,676 --> 00:09:54,719
You get all grumpy.

195
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:57,430
Not to make anyone jealous here,
but I have pasta.

196
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:01,225
- Well, I've got algal oil, so...
- [laughing]

197
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:03,311
Sorry, not to brag...

198
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,438
I think what we'll see
is you're gonna kick my ass.

199
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:09,400
[Gwyneth]
I'm just worried about the no coffee part.

200
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:10,484
I have to have coffee,

201
00:10:10,568 --> 00:10:12,695
otherwise you're not gonna want
to deal with me.

202
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:14,071
[laughing]

203
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,912
So I'm sitting
in the grocery store parking lot,

204
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,957
looking like a real weirdo,
video taping myself.

205
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,334
But what are you gonna do?

206
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:31,672
The key apparently to aging well
inside and out is exercise,

207
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:33,049
which I also believe.

208
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:36,093
And so I just killed myself
on the dance floor

209
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:37,511
at Tracy Anderson for an hour.

210
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,597
I am drenched with sweat.

211
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:42,516
My face is the color of my shirt.

212
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,311
But you know what? No pain, no gain.

213
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,855
I'm trying to figure out
what I can make tonight for dinner,

214
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:50,900
so I think I'm gonna do some salmon
and some brown rice.

215
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:54,320
But, man alive, 50 bucks.

216
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,905
It's crazy.

217
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:59,784
We came to Costco to get some things

218
00:10:59,867 --> 00:11:02,161
and normally,
we would go to In-N-Out Burger

219
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,705
across the street from Costco
for a little treat.

220
00:11:05,373 --> 00:11:07,083
But we can't go today.

221
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,043
So sad.

222
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:10,753
So sad.

223
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,256
Ty, it's killing me on day one!

224
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:15,925
[laughs]

225
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:18,678
This is what's wrong with this diet.

226
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:21,806
My husband's shoving a croissant
in his face.

227
00:11:22,264 --> 00:11:23,307
It's so good.

228
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:27,061
[Ty] Pizza.

229
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,504
[Wendy] It's a little vegan pizza.

230
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,649
It's actually, pretty good, right?

231
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,609
- Yummy.
- [Wendy] Yummy.

232
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,319
Mama likes it, too.

233
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:38,739
I'm eating some kind of reconstituted...

234
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,160
soup with, um, quinoa,

235
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:45,204
possibly zucchini.

236
00:11:45,287 --> 00:11:46,956
I'm not entirely sure.

237
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,309
[Brad Falchuk] I don't understand.
How do you reconstitute it?

238
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,169
- Like, what was it before?
- [laughing]

239
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:57,174
So, they freeze-dry it...

240
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:01,262
and now, we've reconstituted it
with water, so...

241
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,179
[Brad] How's it taste?

242
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:07,101
Hmm.

243
00:12:08,978 --> 00:12:10,312
This one's not so bad.

244
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:13,733
My mushroom soup today at lunch was...

245
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:16,193
really brutal.

246
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:20,448
It didn't...
The mushrooms didn't get spongy again.

247
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:22,533
[Brad] Oh,
didn't get reconstituted appropriately?

248
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,577
[laughing]

249
00:12:25,369 --> 00:12:26,704
Wendy was vegan.

250
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,581
No animal protein whatsoever,

251
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,040
- no dairy, right?
- Right, yes.

252
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:33,252
- Was there alcohol in yours?
- A little bit, just wine.

253
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:36,130
And then you did... pescatarian vegan.

254
00:12:36,213 --> 00:12:39,133
Yeah, more or less.
A little bit of alcohol.

255
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,927
You guys suck, man. That is like...

256
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,739
- We did it for three weeks,
- We're not as hardcore.

257
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:44,889
and you did five days.

258
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:46,575
- So there's that.
- Yeah, but I've done...

259
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,350
I've done cleanses for longer than that.

260
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:53,564
No one can compete with Gwyneth Paltrow,
GP, aka guinea pig. I mean...

261
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:55,900
I am the pet guinea pig, it's true.

262
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,818
[laughing]

263
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:02,740
So, how did you come to connect fasting
to longevity?

264
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:06,202
Yeah, so I was a student of Roy Walford

265
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:08,662
back in the '90s at UCLA.

266
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,057
And he was famous for something
called calorie restriction.

267
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,584
So it was very simple intervention,
just eat less

268
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:17,671
and it turns out that calorie restriction
is extremely powerful,

269
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:20,049
but extremely detrimental
at the same time.

270
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,051
It prevents completely diabetes

271
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,970
and cuts cancer
and cardiovascular disease in half,

272
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:28,682
but then, it makes you anorexic
and gives you lots of problems

273
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:32,645
that have to do with infectious diseases
and wound healing, etc.

274
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,397
So since then, the effort was,

275
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:38,442
how do we get these incredible benefits

276
00:13:38,526 --> 00:13:41,362
without having the detrimental effects?

277
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,279
Right.

278
00:13:42,363 --> 00:13:44,949
[Valter] When you're fasting,
incredible things happen.

279
00:13:45,032 --> 00:13:49,286
The body starts looking for things
that are not working properly.

280
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,788
And we know this to be there,

281
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:52,832
because during development
when we're first born,

282
00:13:52,998 --> 00:13:56,210
there are very clear mechanisms
that get rid of bad cells,

283
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:59,922
keep the good ones and let those
stem cells generate organs, right?

284
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:03,008
So, during the fasting then,
now the normal cells

285
00:14:03,092 --> 00:14:04,844
and the good cells are saved

286
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,554
and they go into a protective mode.

287
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:08,305
The ones that don't behave,

288
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,474
the cancer cells,
autoimmune cells, etc.,

289
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,226
those are the ones that are targeted

290
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,019
and seem to be dying
at a much faster pace.

291
00:14:14,103 --> 00:14:15,980
- That's incredible.
- [Valter] Yeah.

292
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:33,247
There's a reset button
that all organisms push.

293
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,041
And that reset button makes the organism

294
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:38,586
younger, healthier, longer living.

295
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,088
[Gwyneth] Is it going?

296
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,133
- Okay, it's...
- Hello...

297
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:47,720
[laughs] it's day three. I feel...

298
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:50,264
How do I feel?

299
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,558
I feel oddly weak.

300
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,476
Hmm. It's not really oddly.

301
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,354
True. This cleanse has been interesting

302
00:14:57,438 --> 00:15:00,065
because... I, uh...

303
00:15:01,442 --> 00:15:04,445
Usually, if I do a real detox, like I...

304
00:15:04,653 --> 00:15:05,988
and my liver my detoxes,

305
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:10,451
I get really, like, agitated
and angry and stuff and...

306
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:11,660
I never noticed.

307
00:15:12,661 --> 00:15:13,996
- Where we going?
- This way.

308
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,498
Um, and I feel pretty good.

309
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,750
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

310
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:18,918
- Fantastic.
- I mean...

311
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,419
You seem pretty good.

312
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,463
Other than the fact that I feel terrible.

313
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,925
Yeah, but you seem pretty good,
and you seem to have plenty of energy,

314
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:27,301
even though you're...

315
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:29,970
I mean, if I was on 800 calories,
I would be on the floor.

316
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:31,872
- Yeah.
- You're doing pretty well.

317
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:34,934
[Elise] So, we're working on a package
about aging.

318
00:15:35,392 --> 00:15:38,979
And when it comes to aging,
what are you all afraid of?

319
00:15:39,063 --> 00:15:41,857
I don't know, just body failure.

320
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:45,611
Like, starting to feel like
you can't move around

321
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:48,405
or starting to feel like
your mind is starting to go.

322
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:50,824
Like, I'm young, and I know
this is a far way away, but...

323
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,910
Like, my big fear is being a burden

324
00:15:52,993 --> 00:15:54,721
and being, like,
more of an annoyance than...

325
00:15:54,745 --> 00:15:57,831
[Ana] I just feel like I wanna live
my best years and then when it...

326
00:15:57,915 --> 00:16:00,626
I don't feel like I need
to be struggling

327
00:16:00,709 --> 00:16:02,336
- or be a burden.
- Totally agree.

328
00:16:02,419 --> 00:16:07,049
Do any of you guys fear aging, like,
on your faces?

329
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:08,974
- [Stacey] Horrified of it.
- [Elise] You are?

330
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:11,470
- My God. Yeah.
- [Elise] That's so honest. Really?

331
00:16:11,553 --> 00:16:13,013
Yeah, I'm horrified.

332
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,849
I am constantly putting stuff
on my face throughout the day.

333
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,559
I'm always in the bathroom, like...

334
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,828
- It's... yeah.
- [Elise] Really?

335
00:16:18,852 --> 00:16:20,145
It freaks me out, you guys.

336
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,355
- Sorry.
- [Elise] Why?

337
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,900
I feel like for a long time,
it was my currency for relationships,

338
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:27,945
for doing well in high school,
for getting great jobs.

339
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,155
I don't feel that now, by any means,

340
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:33,450
but it felt like it was currency, really,
for success.

341
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:35,494
The fear too I have right now is

342
00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:39,707
I don't want to be trying to maintain
a face that I have now,

343
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,710
instead of just honoring
the face that I have every year

344
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,003
as it's changing.

345
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:45,713
That scares me, too.

346
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:48,674
I think so many women fear
coming out of doctor's office,

347
00:16:48,757 --> 00:16:52,177
looking like they have that one face.

348
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:53,803
Um...

349
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,974
so I understand what you're saying,
not wanting to do something like that.

350
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,226
But then what are the alternatives?

351
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,856
Well, a few of us are gonna try
some facial treatments.

352
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,026
Ideally things... I refuse...

353
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:09,528
I'm not shooting filler into my face.

354
00:17:09,611 --> 00:17:11,238
I don't think anyone will,

355
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:14,116
so I think we're gonna try
some facial treatments

356
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:16,869
that are a little bit more natural.

357
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:19,997
So, I'm gonna do 100 needles in your face,

358
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,680
- [laughing] Okay.
- [Romy] Yeah, I know.

359
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,125
People think, "Oh, my gosh."

360
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,937
I mean, the nice thing about this is
what's happening is

361
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:27,838
we're building collagen naturally.

362
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:29,757
So, there's nothing in the needles, right?

363
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,092
There's no fillers or anything,
and so what happens is

364
00:17:32,176 --> 00:17:34,678
your body's actually producing
its own collagen.

365
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:46,231
You have 100 needles in your face, Elise.

366
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:49,318
- That's crazy.
- So I'm gonna let you lay a bit with them.

367
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,284
[Wendy] Having a big birthday this year
is a little intimidating.

368
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,120
- [Behrooz Torkian] Oh.
- Anything we can do to help. [laughs]

369
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:03,290
The concept of it is,
is these little cones,

370
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:07,294
they stimulate collagen formation,
in addition to holding the skin back.

371
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:09,088
These devices, in general,

372
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,548
- last about nine months in the body.
- Okay.

373
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,053
Okay, so, Wendy, our first step

374
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:20,307
is going to be a couple
of numbing injections here.

375
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:22,810
You should feel the effect
in just a moment.

376
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,269
That was fast.

377
00:18:24,895 --> 00:18:26,495
Amber, I think we're ready to get going.

378
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,942
So, Wendy, we will start on this side.

379
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:32,486
You might hear some crunching sounds
kind of close to the ear.

380
00:18:36,156 --> 00:18:37,407
- Bothersome?
- No.

381
00:18:37,491 --> 00:18:38,534
Great.

382
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,537
How was that tolerability-wise?

383
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:43,389
- Oh. Completely tolerable.
- [Behrooz] It was okay?

384
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:44,331
- Yeah.
- Good.

385
00:18:44,414 --> 00:18:48,585
And next, we're gonna give you a mirror.
I just want to see your reaction.

386
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,045
- Oh, great.
- [Behrooz] Great.

387
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:51,547
Yeah, so you do see the puckering.

388
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:53,358
- [Behrooz] A little bit of Joker action.
- Okay.

389
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:54,651
- Little bit of puckering.
- Yeah.

390
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,717
That's temporary.

391
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:58,279
Before you know it, it loosens up,
and you wouldn't even know it's there.

392
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,806
- Great.
- But you can see along the jaw line.

393
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:02,057
- Yeah.
- Looking good.

394
00:19:02,141 --> 00:19:03,892
- Thank you.
- Excellent, you're welcome.

395
00:19:04,476 --> 00:19:06,603
Okay, so now I'm home.

396
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:08,730
Cleaned it up a little bit.

397
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,232
Do you see mommy's boo-boos?

398
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,904
Do they look crazy? Do I look crazy?

399
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:19,616
Oh! Can I have a kiss?

400
00:19:22,244 --> 00:19:24,121
- [exclaims]
- Be gentle.

401
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:28,250
My son was not terrified by me,
so that's a step in the right direction.

402
00:19:28,876 --> 00:19:31,753
Now I'm gonna collect
your golden broth...

403
00:19:31,837 --> 00:19:33,672
- Oh, my God.
- from your own body.

404
00:19:33,755 --> 00:19:34,756
My golden broth.

405
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,985
That's what I'm gonna call it,
"Gwyneth's Golden Broth."

406
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,594
Oh, my gosh.

407
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:47,060
[Nigma] So, now I'm gonna apply
the numbing cream for you.

408
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,146
- [Nigma laughs]
- Mmm.

409
00:19:49,271 --> 00:19:52,524
They actually use PRP for wound healing.

410
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,902
[Gwyneth] Interesting. How does it work?

411
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:58,363
So, what it's doing is
it's causing your skin to resurface

412
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,199
and shed the dead skin cells.

413
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:02,034
It has all these growth factors in it.

414
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:04,620
Growth factors are amazing
for pigmentation.

415
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,163
Jeez, I'm really numb.

416
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:08,248
Good, that's what we want.

417
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,668
We're filling up really nicely, Gwyneth.

418
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,171
- [groans]
- [laughs]

419
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:15,379
Barf.

420
00:20:15,797 --> 00:20:17,674
I do like that it's, uh...

421
00:20:18,675 --> 00:20:20,469
it's my own material.

422
00:20:20,552 --> 00:20:22,512
It's not a toxin, you know.

423
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,474
[laughs] People shoot a lot of weird shit
into their face.

424
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:29,186
Is the blood getting spun?

425
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:31,271
Yeah, she's spinning your blood.

426
00:20:31,355 --> 00:20:32,356
[whirring]

427
00:20:32,481 --> 00:20:33,982
[Gwyneth] It's slightly nauseating

428
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:37,194
to think about, like,
blood going back into your blood.

429
00:20:37,277 --> 00:20:39,905
I can see that,
but I get excited about it,

430
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,532
because we're seeing
plastic surgeons use this.

431
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:44,493
We're seeing dental surgeons use it.

432
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,827
- Wow.
- It's incredible.

433
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:46,787
The results are...

434
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:48,306
- [bell dings]
- So, it's healing as well?

435
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,498
It's healing as well.

436
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,292
Beautiful.

437
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,211
Oh, God.

438
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,880
[Nigma laughing] It's gorgeous.

439
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:57,964
It grosses me out.

440
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:00,759
[Nigma] Okay.

441
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,345
- Should I be scared?
- Not at all.

442
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:06,598
You put it on the forehead?

443
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:09,559
- Yes, and then I just needle this in.
- [needle buzzing]

444
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,395
How does that feel?
Can you feel anything?

445
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,522
- Oh. No.
- Great.

446
00:21:16,066 --> 00:21:19,278
I thought this was gonna be,
like, blood all over the place.

447
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:22,531
- Well, we're not done yet. [laughs]
- Oh.

448
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,202
I think it is catching on now,

449
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:30,998
that people are less looking
to do Botox and fillers.

450
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:33,101
- They're looking at doing things that...
<i>- </i>Yeah, for sure.

451
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:36,628
I think we've just seen overuse
of that stuff.

452
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,152
Sometimes you would look at somebody

453
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:41,967
and couldn't tell if they were
25 or 55, you know?

454
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:46,263
People want a more natural way.

455
00:21:46,346 --> 00:21:48,974
- Aging gracefully, right?
- Yeah.

456
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:51,560
[buzzing stops]

457
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:54,604
So, I'm gonna show you
what your skin looks like.

458
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,442
[gasps]

459
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:00,193
- No, I'm just kidding.
- [laughter]

460
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:02,612
Oh, look at that.

461
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,489
[Nigma] So, it's a bit pink in some areas.

462
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,868
You'll be pink tomorrow,
probably for about three days.

463
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:10,662
- [Gwyneth] Wow! Thank you.
- [laughs]

464
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:16,376
So, we also externally worked
on ourselves.

465
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,794
What did you do?

466
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,296
You had the hardest diet.

467
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:22,758
I had the hardest external treatment.
I did the threading.

468
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:24,134
Did you notice a difference?

469
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:26,428
I noticed a difference.
I think now they say,

470
00:22:26,511 --> 00:22:28,555
you'll notice a difference
in another three months.

471
00:22:28,638 --> 00:22:29,931
I think you look amazing.

472
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,909
- I thought you looked amazing before, too.
- Thank you.

473
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,227
But you look completely like yourself.

474
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,605
- Your skin looks beautiful.
- What did you do?

475
00:22:36,688 --> 00:22:38,690
I did an acupuncture facial.

476
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,401
I got off the easiest
because my treatment was...

477
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:42,652
In every way possible.

478
00:22:42,736 --> 00:22:44,279
Essentially, I almost fell asleep.

479
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:45,947
- It was deeply relaxing.
- [laughing]

480
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:47,616
And you?

481
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:50,911
- I did the PRP facial.
- [Elise] I thought you looked...

482
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,412
I thought I looked, yeah...

483
00:22:52,496 --> 00:22:55,332
- Pretty, like, rosy and vibrant.
- It was good.

484
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:58,710
My, uh, baby daddy was like,
"You look five years younger."

485
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,338
- [laughing]
- I think they're Band-Aids, right?

486
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:03,548
- They're very similar to drugs.
- [Gwyneth] Right.

487
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:06,218
I think, uh, the effort would be better

488
00:23:06,301 --> 00:23:08,970
to be in rejuvenation
of the entire system,

489
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,389
which is gonna include the face.

490
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:13,016
[Morgan]
We actually find that the biological age

491
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:16,103
- is correlated with your facial age, so...
- Interesting.

492
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:18,814
If you can make yourself younger
on the inside,

493
00:23:18,897 --> 00:23:21,066
you're probably gonna look younger
as well.

494
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:26,154
What are we on? I'm on day three.
I'm at the end of the day.

495
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,448
[Apple] Hmm. You just had dinner.

496
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,535
I just had dinner,
which I was so hungry for,

497
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,578
[chuckling] that I forgot to film it.

498
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,832
[Apple] You had 500 calories today.

499
00:23:36,957 --> 00:23:37,999
I think so.

500
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,961
[Apple]
So, how many days do you have left?

501
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:42,337
Like, two more days.

502
00:23:44,005 --> 00:23:46,275
- [Apple] You got it,
- I think tomorrow I have more food.

503
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,069
- Let me go get the thing.
- [Apple] All right.

504
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,887
- Let's look.
- [Apple] Okay. Hi, Daffo.

505
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:56,560
Okay, so my whole food,
every day comes in a box like this.

506
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,227
[Apple] Gorgeous.

507
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:02,107
[sighs] So, tomorrow I have...

508
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,610
Ooh. I have this nut bar in the morning,
which is really good.

509
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,155
And I get a dessert tomorrow...

510
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,998
- [Apple] Yes!
- ...which I didn't get today.

511
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:13,493
Now, for the really decadent part,

512
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,830
four bags of tea!

513
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:17,956
[Apple] Yay!

514
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,167
Oh, my God,
my mouth is literally watering.

515
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:22,502
[Wendy] I have really perfected

516
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:26,756
my strawberry-banana
vegan ice cream recipe.

517
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,676
Put a little granola on at the end.

518
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:30,969
It's beautiful.

519
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,971
- More?
- [Wendy] Yeah.

520
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:40,729
- Yummy?
- Yeah.

521
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,898
Yeah! It's delicious.

522
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:45,025
Not bad.

523
00:24:45,692 --> 00:24:46,902
Who needs dairy?

524
00:24:49,571 --> 00:24:52,491
Second to last night
before the end of this challenge.

525
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:54,951
I'm having some veggie chili.

526
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,745
Not that excited about it.

527
00:24:56,828 --> 00:24:58,413
I'm feeling a little depleted.

528
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:00,415
I think 'cause everyone in my house
is sick.

529
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:05,712
And I'm weirdly feeling like I need meat,
also because I have my period.

530
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:07,463
Um...

531
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,508
So, I'm just feeling like...

532
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:13,345
all right, maybe I need
a little more sustenance.

533
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,554
A little more protein.

534
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,641
Well, it's day five.

535
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:23,647
And I'm dying, and I'm hangry.

536
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,066
The fifth day today I actually
kind of feel...

537
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:29,194
the worst.

538
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:33,740
It's weird, 'cause yesterday
I had felt, like, kind of amazing.

539
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:35,784
Today, so far this morning,

540
00:25:35,867 --> 00:25:39,704
I'm feeling like I might... fall down.

541
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,542
Um, but I'm gonna see it through.

542
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:53,385
Okay, so after we each
kind of went through an experiment.

543
00:25:53,468 --> 00:25:56,221
- What is our biological age?
- Yes. Are we allowed to know?

544
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:57,556
Who wants to know first?

545
00:25:57,639 --> 00:25:59,199
- Go in the same order.
- [Morgan] Okay.

546
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,811
So, Wendy, you actually did not decrease.

547
00:26:03,478 --> 00:26:05,272
- Oh!
- You stayed almost exactly the same.

548
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:08,817
- Okay.
- Elise, your finishing was 36.8.

549
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:12,612
- Oh, that's great.
- So, you lost about a year.

550
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,155
- [laughing]
- That's amazing.

551
00:26:14,239 --> 00:26:17,158
And you thought you were not going to win.

552
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:19,035
Well...

553
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:21,037
And Gwyneth lost the most.

554
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:25,750
Um, so, you started at 44.2,
and you went to 42.5.

555
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,461
- [Elise and Wendy] Wow!
- You lost one and three quarter years.

556
00:26:28,545 --> 00:26:30,922
That's so great! That's so cool.

557
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:36,511
It's funny, I've done
a million different crazy fasts.

558
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:39,264
I've tried everything,
but this one was pretty incredible.

559
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:43,685
I mean, I had a really amazing experience
doing it.

560
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,530
[Wendy]
You can throw vegan out the window..

561
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:48,189
No, you just need to add fish.
You just need to eat how I ate.

562
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,107
- Yeah?
- [Valter] Yeah.

563
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:53,570
So the vegan diet, um,
is definitely a very good diet.

564
00:26:53,653 --> 00:26:56,990
But very difficult to maintain
a normal intake of proteins,

565
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:58,283
so it's not that surprising.

566
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:03,288
You get lots of good and lots of bad.
In the end, they cancel each other out.

567
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,998
Now when you go to the pescatarian,

568
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,251
you're starting to see all the good
and very little of the bad.

569
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:12,380
So, it's very good to start with that
with the fast-mimicking periods.

570
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:15,592
The idea is to do it maybe,
you know, three times a year.

571
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:17,844
Is five days really the max
that you can do?

572
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:22,265
Well, yes. I mean, if you go longer,
then you start seeing the problems.

573
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:25,518
And also you see, eventually,
the slowing down of metabolism,

574
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:29,147
and that slow down can last
even when you return to normal diet.

575
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:31,910
- And you don't want that. So we see that.
- No, we don't want that.

576
00:27:31,941 --> 00:27:35,612
Other than diet, what would you say
is the second most important?

577
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:37,155
Is it sleep, is it stress?

578
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:38,865
It's everything you kind of know.

579
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:41,201
- Right.
- Don't smoke, exercise,

580
00:27:41,284 --> 00:27:42,494
get sleep,

581
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:45,830
and it seems like genetics
plays a little bit of a role in it,

582
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:46,998
so, you know.

583
00:27:47,082 --> 00:27:50,043
It's like you say, the tenants
of wellness are typically free.

584
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:52,045
- [Morgan] Yeah.
<i>- </i>It's true.

585
00:27:52,128 --> 00:27:56,424
- But I think exercise is as important.
- [Valter] Yeah, absolutely.

586
00:27:56,508 --> 00:28:00,512
The data suggests
about 150 minutes a week,

587
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:03,932
of which maybe 10% should be
fairly strenuous.

588
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:06,643
- That seems to be ideal.
- I do more than that.

589
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,019
Paying attention to

590
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:11,314
not doing damage to yourself
if you want to be healthy.

591
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:15,944
So, I think that we really need
to start teaching this in medical schools

592
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,363
and have doctors that are trained
in health span,

593
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,031
and what I call "youth span."

594
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,617
We keep somebody young
as long as possible,

595
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,745
and after that,
you keep this person healthy

596
00:28:25,829 --> 00:28:26,913
as long as possible.

597
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:28,873
- Yeah.
- That is so cool.

598
00:28:28,957 --> 00:28:32,252
But, Valter, we need to have
a soup discussion.

599
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:34,504
- [Elise laughs]
- Well, you know,

600
00:28:34,713 --> 00:28:36,673
there's certainly room for improvement.

601
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:40,552
If I could make my own soup,
I would do that, like, four times a year.

602
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,554
So, you can go back to your french fries.

603
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:45,849
- Oh, I'm back to my french fries.
- [laughing]

604
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,812
