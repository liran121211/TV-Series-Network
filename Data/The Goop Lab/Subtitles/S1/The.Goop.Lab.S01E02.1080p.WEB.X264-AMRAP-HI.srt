1
00:00:05,922 --> 00:00:08,967
When I started goop in 2008,

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,970
I was like, "My calling is something else
besides, you know,

3
00:00:12,053 --> 00:00:14,472
making out with Matt Damon on screen
or whatever."

4
00:00:14,556 --> 00:00:15,556
[laughs]

5
00:00:16,683 --> 00:00:19,769
And now, it's this modern lifestyle brand.

6
00:00:19,853 --> 00:00:23,481
To me, it's all laddering up to one thing,
which is optimization of self.

7
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:26,192
Like, we're here one time, one life...

8
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:29,112
Like, how can we really, like,
milk the shit out of this?

9
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,447
[laughing]

10
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:32,365
You have 100 needles in your face, Elise.

11
00:00:32,574 --> 00:00:34,826
Just another day at the office.

12
00:00:34,909 --> 00:00:36,953
The opportunity that we have
with the goop lab

13
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:40,665
is that, as a company,
we can go out in different groups

14
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:43,918
and go on a much deeper dive
into some of these topics

15
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:45,712
that our readers are curious about.

16
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:48,131
- [laughing]
- This is gonna be my first experience

17
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:49,275
- with mushrooms.
- [Gillian] Oh!

18
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:51,593
- [exhales]
- [woman] You have to let go of your ego.

19
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:53,112
[Gwyneth] So what happens in a workshop?

20
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:54,679
- Everyone gets off.
- [woman moaning]

21
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,848
What the fuck are you doing to people?

22
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,183
[Wim vocalizing]

23
00:00:58,266 --> 00:01:02,187
We get to explore, like, is this real?
Do we feel better?

24
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:05,148
And grapple with some topics that are hard

25
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:06,816
and embarrassing or shameful.

26
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:08,318
Isn't that beautiful?

27
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,569
- [exhales]
- [woman 2] Relax.

28
00:01:09,652 --> 00:01:11,780
That was, like, next level shit.

29
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:16,076
So, are you guys ready to go out
in the field and make a ruckus?

30
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,161
- [Elise] Yeah.
- You can handle it, right?

31
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:19,871
[laughing]

32
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:29,464
[theme music playing]

33
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:47,482
[Wim Hof] Seven degrees Celsius,
44 degrees Fahrenheit.

34
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:50,652
Thermo shockingly cold...

35
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,780
for a human to go into the water.

36
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,866
You cannot just jump in.

37
00:01:57,742 --> 00:01:59,035
This is dangerous.

38
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,245
Right over here.

39
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:04,582
I started to feel,
like, a panic attack coming on.

40
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:09,712
A human wouldn't last too long,
and he would go into involuntary gasping.

41
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,171
[gasps]

42
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,093
But cold water is a great way

43
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:17,262
to learn to deal with stress.

44
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:21,099
- If you learn how to breathe deep...
- [inhales]

45
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:22,475
Fully in.

46
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,852
Breathe in.

47
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,353
Letting go.

48
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:28,314
[exhales] I'm gonna pass out.

49
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,818
You can go into the cold water
and adapt.

50
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:37,031
And with that,
you become the alchemist of life itself.

51
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,534
Kate, it's your moment.

52
00:02:51,004 --> 00:02:53,131
- [Wim] There's the lady. Hello.
- Hi.

53
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:56,050
I've just been watching
YouTube videos of you.

54
00:02:56,134 --> 00:02:58,595
- All right. Can I hug you?
- Of course.

55
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:00,889
- Hi, you lovely lady.
- Thank you.

56
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:03,516
- It's so nice to meet you. Amazing.
- Nice to meet you.

57
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,935
- Thank you.
- I can't believe you're real.

58
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,938
You're the living example
of mind over matter.

59
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:11,608
Yes. They call me "The Ice Man"

60
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:15,236
because I do all kinds of extremes
in the cold,

61
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:20,158
and I show through evidence-based studies
that our autonomic nervous system

62
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,327
can be influenced just by the mind.

63
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:25,121
I think what you're trying to prove
or are in the process of proving

64
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,290
is that this prevailing belief

65
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:31,628
that we cannot control our
autonomic nervous system is a fallacy

66
00:03:31,711 --> 00:03:33,838
and that we can directly impact

67
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:37,050
and affect our immune system, our mood,

68
00:03:37,133 --> 00:03:38,885
the way that we respond to life.

69
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:42,889
Yeah. Yes. And now, I work with scientists
all over the world.

70
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,767
So, we provoked a reaction already.

71
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,812
The study I did showed
that just by using the mind,

72
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,732
I was able to make the skin temperature

73
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:56,653
not go down after exposure of cold water.

74
00:03:56,736 --> 00:03:57,779
That's crazy.

75
00:03:57,862 --> 00:04:00,573
That led to the interest of scientists.

76
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:03,576
They injected E. coli bacteria,

77
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,287
and I did not become sick.

78
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:10,416
I was able to defy the reaction

79
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:12,210
of the bacteria injected.

80
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:16,047
I read about that.
And you've taught people how to do it.

81
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,465
Within four days,

82
00:04:17,548 --> 00:04:22,262
they were able to do what medical history
has stated is not possible.

83
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,028
We changed science over there.

84
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,965
It would have been amazing
to take the goop staff

85
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:42,490
and shoot them full of endotoxins,

86
00:04:42,573 --> 00:04:44,617
- but Netflix legal said no.
- [laughing]

87
00:04:45,076 --> 00:04:48,913
Yes. I tell you, we found natural ways

88
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:52,625
to get people back in control
over their own mood

89
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:56,587
and to influence their inflammation,
which is disease,

90
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,047
using three pillars:

91
00:04:58,131 --> 00:04:59,841
Breathing techniques,

92
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:03,011
gradual cold exposure,

93
00:05:03,094 --> 00:05:04,345
and mindset,

94
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:06,848
or the Wim Hof Method.

95
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:11,644
Do you ever think about why you
are the chosen person

96
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:14,439
to discover this
and brought it to the world?

97
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,149
[Wim Hof] I see my function now:

98
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:20,903
to help millions and millions of people
when they are having inflammation

99
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:25,700
or psychosis or depression or anxiety
or fear or anything.

100
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:28,745
Now, what I did with these guys
at Lake Tahoe.

101
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:30,747
- [Kate] Yeah.
- [Wim] The goop team...

102
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:33,750
- Tell your story.
- Yeah, tell your story.

103
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:35,060
- [Kate] I mean...
- [Wim] It's beautiful.

104
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:36,270
[Gwyneth] Tell the whole thing.

105
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:40,298
Like, I think about it, and I still
can't believe that it really happened.

106
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:48,181
[Wim] Hey, guys.

107
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:49,098
[woman] Hi.

108
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,725
- [Wim] How's it going?
- [Ana] Hi.

109
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,353
[Wim laughs, exhales]

110
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:56,481
We're gonna have two days,
great days together, yeah?

111
00:05:56,564 --> 00:06:00,276
We come here together
to share natural wisdom...

112
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:02,110
through breathing.

113
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:05,990
After thousands of years of traditions
of breathing techniques,

114
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,452
both in yoga and in China, in Japan...

115
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:13,748
It has shown its power,
but it took, like, 20 years of training,

116
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,334
and I want you to learn it
within ten minutes.

117
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,295
- Wow.
- [Wim] Breathing makes the body alkaline.

118
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:22,799
What do you need
to go into the elements of nature

119
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,133
and to oppose it?

120
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:26,010
You need an alkaline body.

121
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,888
Alkaline body is the right biochemistry

122
00:06:28,971 --> 00:06:32,683
for the nervous system
to adapt to the environment.

123
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,520
And this weekend,
you're gonna prime the body

124
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:40,775
to go and meet the cold
and become like peaceful warriors.

125
00:06:52,036 --> 00:06:56,207
- Okay, I'm sort of a crazy Dutchman.
- [laughs]

126
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,042
- Who are you?
- My name's David.

127
00:06:58,126 --> 00:07:02,213
I've never done
any cold exposure therapy before,

128
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:04,632
so, yeah, I'm very excited
to learn more about that.

129
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:07,593
After this weekend, you will be an expert.

130
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,762
- [David] Yeah.
- Nice.

131
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,298
- Hey, beautiful.
- I'm Megan,

132
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:14,475
and I'm the coldest person in the world.

133
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:17,061
- [Wim] Oh, wow. That's great.
- Yeah.

134
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,188
- So we got a challenge coming.
- Yeah.

135
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:20,898
I'm skeptical, but I'd love it.

136
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:22,692
- Deal.
- Deal.

137
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:24,569
- [laughing]
- Yes, baby.

138
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,195
My name's Heaven.

139
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,241
Um, my boyfriend takes a cold shower
every single morning.

140
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:34,036
He's never sick.
He always has his, like, mind clear,

141
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,665
and I'm sort of thinking, "Should I be
taking cold showers every morning?"

142
00:07:37,748 --> 00:07:40,668
A cold shower a day keeps the doctor away.

143
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:42,211
[laughing]

144
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,089
My name is Kate.
I'm the executive editor at goop.

145
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:50,136
After having my baby,
I was diagnosed with a panic disorder.

146
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,388
I've always had terrible anxiety,

147
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:56,934
but after having a child, it all just
kind of spiraled out of control.

148
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:00,146
I will teach you how
to feel the sense of control

149
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,983
over the hormonal imbalance
that creates the panic.

150
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:05,693
I would love nothing more. [chuckles]

151
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,570
Yes. It's going to happen. Thank you.

152
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:11,657
I'm Sara. I read a few of the studies
you participated in,

153
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:14,285
and it was really interesting
that you were able to show

154
00:08:14,368 --> 00:08:16,120
that this is not just a placebo effect,

155
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:19,415
uh, both in you
and other control subjects,

156
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:21,125
and I wanted to see for myself.

157
00:08:21,209 --> 00:08:24,670
I'm Ana.
I'm one of the food editors at goop.

158
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:29,133
And I'm here because I think I just need
to learn how to breathe.

159
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:32,094
I end up getting so anxious or stressed

160
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,764
in ways that I know I could
just breathe through it.

161
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:38,059
Breathing is really what I think
is, like, mostly my focus.

162
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,269
- Yes. Great!
- [Ana] Let's do it.

163
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,771
[laughing]

164
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:49,362
[Wim] All right, beautiful people.

165
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:51,572
We're gonna go into the depth today.

166
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:56,536
We follow the breath,
the breath is the guide.

167
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:59,121
Don't force the guide.

168
00:08:59,705 --> 00:09:02,333
- Fully in.
- [inhaling]

169
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:05,294
- Letting go.
- [exhaling]

170
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:08,214
These breathing techniques,
they go very deep.

171
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:12,051
Don't do them in the car while driving,

172
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:15,346
don't do them in a swimming pool.

173
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,474
- Fully in.
- [inhaling]

174
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:21,060
- Letting go.
- [exhaling]

175
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:24,564
Let the thoughts go. Follow the breath.

176
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:28,526
The breath is able
to go anywhere in the body.

177
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,778
To all cells.

178
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:34,282
The body is becoming alkaline.

179
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:37,994
- A total reset in the depths.
- [exhales]

180
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:41,330
- Here it comes. Fully in!
- [inhaling]

181
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:42,832
- Let it go.
- [exhaling]

182
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:46,877
- And stop after the exhalation.
- [exhales]

183
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:51,799
[Wim] Excellent.

184
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:56,053
Enjoy the peace.

185
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,514
- [wind howling]
- [bird squawks]

186
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,312
[Wim] We go a little faster.

187
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:09,233
- Fully in. [grunting]
- [inhaling and exhaling]

188
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:13,987
[Wim] Fully in!

189
00:10:14,947 --> 00:10:17,283
Don't hold back!

190
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:19,619
[Wim grunting]

191
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:21,787
Go, go! [continues grunting]

192
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,503
Go! [grunting]

193
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:33,090
- Fully in.
- [inhaling]

194
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,217
- Fully out.
- [exhaling]

195
00:10:35,301 --> 00:10:37,595
Fully in and hold.

196
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:42,224
Free all the blockages.

197
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,520
The soul knows no fear.

198
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:54,195
No agony, no anxiety. All there.

199
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:58,574
You are in control. You are in control.

200
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:03,079
I can feel the tears.
I can feel the emotion.

201
00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,789
That feeling makes you able

202
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,459
to go on your journey being confronted

203
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:12,463
with anything that comes
between you and your goal.

204
00:11:13,714 --> 00:11:15,549
We are ready for the next step.

205
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,135
The soul has come home.

206
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:24,767
I felt a little emotional,
or a lot emotional.

207
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:27,853
I was not expecting that type of reaction
out of it.

208
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,021
The fast breathing

209
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:32,358
and, like, my whole body
feeling tingly and stuff...

210
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:35,361
I don't know, I just wanted to cry,
I still feel like crying right now.

211
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:38,739
I don't know why,
but, like, I couldn't stop crying.

212
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:42,576
I don't know, I just felt like
he was talking to me and I like...

213
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,206
Yeah, I just got really...
[sighs] emotional about it.

214
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:49,375
[Wim] What is happening, Kate?

215
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:52,712
I went completely numb and tingly
in my hands,

216
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:56,424
- which is all panic attack symptoms.
- Yes.

217
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,217
My hands go into, like, claws.

218
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:02,805
It was basically all the physical symptoms
of a panic attack.

219
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:04,515
- It was like exposure therapy
- Yeah.

220
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:07,101
because it almost triggered
a panic attack.

221
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,436
Yeah. I saw you shiver.

222
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,622
- All of the physical symptoms.
- That's not of the cold.

223
00:12:10,646 --> 00:12:13,399
Yeah, it's not.
Like, my teeth were chattering

224
00:12:13,482 --> 00:12:16,277
and that's all... everything that
happens to me during a panic attack.

225
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,988
I shake, my teeth chatter,
everything goes numb.

226
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:22,491
A panic attack
is very much like fear driven.

227
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:23,868
You start to feel the symptoms,

228
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:25,971
and you're like,
"Oh, shit, I'm having a panic attack."

229
00:12:25,995 --> 00:12:28,873
And then the fear of that
kind of fuels it

230
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,375
until you're like,
"Okay, I need to go to the ER now."

231
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:35,212
But if I had to kind of articulate
what the difference was,

232
00:12:35,296 --> 00:12:38,841
is that the fear element wasn't there.

233
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,844
The way Wim kind of talked us through
the breathing,

234
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,471
the symptoms would dissipate.

235
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:45,306
Yeah. Well done.

236
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:46,891
[Kate] It was insane.

237
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,312
I have such severe anxiety that normally,
and Elise knows this,

238
00:12:51,395 --> 00:12:53,415
because she's gotten
those panicked phone calls from me

239
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:57,193
before I have to get on a plane.
I have to drug myself.

240
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:01,071
I have to take Klonopin
or any kind of medication...

241
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,656
- Right.
- ...to get through,

242
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:05,117
just to be in the car to the airport.

243
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:08,913
That is something a lot
of people can identify with.

244
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:13,083
My first wife had anxiety, trauma,

245
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,044
fear, depression...

246
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:19,215
and going through the system,
psychiatry, pills, medicines...

247
00:13:19,465 --> 00:13:20,549
only got worse.

248
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:26,055
So it got completely out of hand,
and the terror was too big.

249
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:30,476
In '95, she jumped from the eighth story

250
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:35,147
just after giving kisses of goodbye
to young children.

251
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:36,440
[woman moans sadly]

252
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:39,527
Beautiful woman decides to jump

253
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,171
- from the eighth story down.
- Oh, my God.

254
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,114
- That's so terrible.
- There I am with four children,

255
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,659
very little money, brokenhearted.

256
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,620
But there the soul-search began.

257
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:52,998
I always say my children made me survive,

258
00:13:53,999 --> 00:13:57,795
but the cold water healed me.

259
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:00,339
Because I went into nature,

260
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:04,802
I swim under thick caps of ice.

261
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,471
In nature, your mind becomes strong.

262
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:11,267
I learned about stillness therein.

263
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:14,353
Through breath, cold, and mindset.

264
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:15,436
Yes.

265
00:14:29,785 --> 00:14:32,037
[Wim] I think this is
a transformational technique

266
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,956
that will change mental healthcare.

267
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,463
My work is extremely intense.

268
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,884
I'm a physician/oncologist,
so my life is full of stress.

269
00:14:45,426 --> 00:14:47,761
I treat leukemias, lymphomas,

270
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:49,889
and I also do bone marrow transplants.

271
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:54,810
It's a tough field because some
of my patients unfortunately die,

272
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:56,687
and I have to deal with this consistently.

273
00:14:57,813 --> 00:15:02,109
A number of times I tended to get,
I would say, depressed.

274
00:15:02,192 --> 00:15:06,155
I tended to have more trouble dealing
with my anxieties.

275
00:15:07,531 --> 00:15:10,451
I did a little bit of research on Wim Hof,

276
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:13,329
and I started
to practice his breathing technique

277
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:14,997
and cold exposure,

278
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,585
and I do feel a dramatic effect
on my ability to cope.

279
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:21,712
I have to give to my patients,

280
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:25,257
and I have to give them the strength,
and I have to give them hope.

281
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:29,011
And his method
is definitely helping me with that.

282
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:34,558
I also think that women
are connected to this power of breath

283
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:35,809
because of childbirth

284
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:40,105
and the idea of sort of removing pain

285
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:42,274
from your body with breath.

286
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,026
If you do conscious breathing,

287
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,820
you'll consciously go
into the biochemistry,

288
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:52,534
and the amount of stress
coming upon your body is less.

289
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:55,579
- Wow.
- You are the master over the situation.

290
00:15:56,205 --> 00:15:57,873
So. you train them in your breath work,

291
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,376
and then the minute you're done,

292
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,211
you're ready for cold exposure?

293
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,545
- Yes.
- We did "snowga,"

294
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:07,216
which was basically yoga in the snow
in our bikinis.

295
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:09,385
- How long?
- Twenty-five minutes.

296
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:11,428
- Out in the snow.
- Twenty-five minutes outside.

297
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,180
And these are people who live in LA

298
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:16,892
who have, like, zero business being out
in the snow in their bikinis.

299
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,979
Before you go into the lake,
you go into the cold.

300
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:23,691
So, you are able to exercise
the vascular system.

301
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,526
It's like beginning with a weight.

302
00:16:25,609 --> 00:16:27,111
Begin with three kilos.

303
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,279
Then to five, seven...

304
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,616
Follow your feeling.
Your feeling is the guide.

305
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,702
Don't force the guides.

306
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:36,787
[suspenseful music playing]

307
00:16:38,956 --> 00:16:40,676
- [Heaven] We're going.
- [Wim] There we go!

308
00:16:43,252 --> 00:16:45,295
[David]
All right, where are the shoes coming off?

309
00:16:46,463 --> 00:16:48,090
Right here?

310
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:50,884
- [Megan] I feel like I've wet my pants.
- [laughs]

311
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:55,889
[Kate] To go out into the cold
in nothing but a bathing suit is...

312
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,475
I think it would be weird
if I wasn't scared of it.

313
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,561
- [Wim] Here we go.
- [David] Oh, fuck.

314
00:17:00,853 --> 00:17:03,814
[Wim] Come on!
Make a stance and there we go.

315
00:17:04,481 --> 00:17:06,483
[grunting]

316
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,906
[grunts] Give it noise!

317
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:14,550
I don't know if I could have done that.

318
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,911
I'm actually... honestly I'm surprised

319
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:19,872
- all of us were able to do it.
- [Elise] Yeah.

320
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,462
[Megan] Going into snowga,
I felt really skeptical,

321
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:28,547
especially 'cause you're standing
on the snow.

322
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,965
That seems kinda crazy,

323
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,872
considering that I have a hard time
with air conditioning,

324
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:37,973
but it was so fun,
and my body just felt warm.

325
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:42,102
- [Wim grunting]
- [Megan shouts, laughs]

326
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:45,856
[Wim] Yeah! Give each other a high-five.

327
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:50,360
Our original state of our mind is able

328
00:17:50,444 --> 00:17:54,740
to take on stress,
but not the way we live.

329
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:59,286
[vocalizes] Lake Tah...

330
00:17:59,411 --> 00:18:00,954
We have gone into cities.

331
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:04,583
We never feel the elements of nature
within us.

332
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,337
Thus, our bodies are in a different state,

333
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,882
like a muscle if you don't train it,
becomes weak.

334
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:13,801
Partners, warrior.

335
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,595
There we go!

336
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:20,682
The vascular system is three times
the length of the world inside

337
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:22,601
with millions of little muscles.

338
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:24,853
If you take a cold shower,

339
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:29,566
those little muscles begin to bring
the blood flow a lot better to the cells.

340
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:32,236
Let's go. In the circle.

341
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:33,922
- The butt in the snow.
- [Megan] Aw, shit.

342
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:35,989
- [David] Oh, gosh.
- [Megan] Okay, try it.

343
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,113
- [Wim] Let's go for the feet.
- [Heaven] All right.

344
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:39,701
[Ana shudders] Okay.

345
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,286
- [Wim] Yeah.
- [Ana] Ooh!

346
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:42,663
[Wim speaks indistinctly]

347
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:45,666
- [Heaven] Come on. Come on.
- [Wim] Come on. There you are.

348
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,253
[Ana laughs] I felt energized,
and I still feel that way.

349
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:51,272
- [Wim] Come on, hey, the split!
- [shouts]

350
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:55,759
[Ana] I think that the water portion
is gonna be more tough.

351
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,428
I hope I can get all the way in.

352
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:00,139
- [Wim] Snowball fight. Hey!
- [laughing]

353
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,474
- [screaming]
- [laughing]

354
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:04,268
[Wim shouts]

355
00:19:04,351 --> 00:19:07,938
The cold works.
We got a lot of anecdotal evidence

356
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:12,192
of people who are cured
in all kinds of diseases.

357
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:20,200
My favorite way
to embarrass my kids in public

358
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:24,454
is to remind them
that I'm not paralyzed anymore.

359
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:29,168
I had contracted an autoimmune disorder
called Guillain-Barre,

360
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:33,046
and the diagnosis was, "We need
to warn you that you may not make it.

361
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:35,215
But if you do make it,

362
00:19:35,299 --> 00:19:38,719
you have a 50/50 chance
of permanent paralysis.

363
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:42,389
A couple days later,
they let my daughter into the room

364
00:19:42,472 --> 00:19:45,392
and of course, she's 11,
and she's my little angel.

365
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:49,062
Big tears in her eyes and she comes in,

366
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,106
"Oh, my God, Daddy,
are you gonna be okay?"

367
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,441
And I said,
"Yeah, I'm gonna be okay, sweetheart."

368
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,278
And she came over and she held my hand

369
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:59,007
and she looked me straight in the eye
with big tears, and she said...

370
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,782
[sniffles] Excuse me.

371
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,619
"But, Daddy, you have to promise me.

372
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:05,871
Because I know
you'll never break a promise."

373
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,373
Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

374
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:10,959
And I did. I promised her.

375
00:20:12,127 --> 00:20:15,756
My son, who's 15 comes out,
and he says,

376
00:20:15,839 --> 00:20:18,091
"Hey, Dad, there's this guy,

377
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:21,511
and his immune system's so strong
he can't get sick."

378
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,096
It was Wim Hof.

379
00:20:24,097 --> 00:20:25,933
So, I started training with him.

380
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:28,644
They helped me in the shower
and turned the cold water on,

381
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:29,895
and I'm like... [gasping]

382
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:34,149
And in three months,
I was completely symptom free.

383
00:20:34,316 --> 00:20:35,484
Out, gone, done.

384
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,361
And that was four years ago.

385
00:20:37,444 --> 00:20:40,405
I've done it every single day
of my life since then.

386
00:20:41,323 --> 00:20:43,283
[inhales] Fully in.

387
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:45,035
[exhales] Let it go.

388
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:49,748
I can even hear his voice.
"Go, Doug, you can do it." [laughs]

389
00:20:56,713 --> 00:21:00,717
The mindset is important.
I go into the cold.

390
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:02,094
Your mind becomes strong.

391
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:05,097
And I tell you,
everybody is able to do this.

392
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,724
Only, we have never been schooled

393
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:10,686
how to deal with stress just by thought.

394
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:14,189
My son can sit in one of your ice baths
for two minutes.

395
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:16,149
[laughs]
He started when he was 11 years old.

396
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,026
- Eleven years old. Amazing!
- Yes.

397
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,238
Now he's 13 and he can...
Yeah, he does it a lot.

398
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:23,657
This is the best investment you can have.

399
00:21:27,744 --> 00:21:30,872
Wim Hof has had impact in our lives

400
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:33,959
by showing that he is not superhuman,

401
00:21:34,042 --> 00:21:38,171
that his kind of ability
to do what he does

402
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:40,632
is within everyone's reach.

403
00:21:40,716 --> 00:21:45,429
I believe I started practicing Wim Hof
when I was 13 years old,

404
00:21:45,512 --> 00:21:47,222
and my mother introduced it to me.

405
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:50,726
It's something I do before I have a test
at school or before I run.

406
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:52,686
I do a couple rounds of Wim Hof.

407
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:56,565
I take a cold shower,
and I go to school feeling really ready.

408
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:58,608
I really found a lot of benefit from it.

409
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,986
I feel like it gives me mental clarity.

410
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,738
I love that we do have it as a family.

411
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:04,489
We usually all just go down to the beach

412
00:22:04,573 --> 00:22:07,617
and just ocean plunge
for ten or 15 minutes.

413
00:22:07,701 --> 00:22:09,536
And then you stand up and you do your...

414
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:11,621
- My horse stance. You like that.
- Yeah.

415
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,391
He's like, "Don't do that
when my friends are out."

416
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,542
- I'm kidding.
- [laughs]

417
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:20,839
Horse stance is,
like, a very structured movement,

418
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:23,091
and it kind of gets you in that place

419
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:26,678
of "I'm about to plunge my body

420
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,889
into very cold water."

421
00:22:28,972 --> 00:22:31,641
[inhaling, exhaling]

422
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,812
[Wim] Roll in like the seashore.

423
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,315
[inhaling, exhaling]

424
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:40,067
The wave comes.

425
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:44,196
Letting go. Follow the flow.

426
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:50,243
We're gonna go immerse
into very stressful cold water.

427
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:04,716
Just be as nature is calling upon us.

428
00:23:05,467 --> 00:23:07,469
Follow the life force.

429
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:10,013
We are her children.

430
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:14,851
Today, we will meet nature.

431
00:23:16,603 --> 00:23:19,773
This is it. We will jump into the depth.

432
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:23,609
Horse stance.

433
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,488
[loud grunting]

434
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:41,711
- [Wim screams]
- [all yelling]

435
00:23:49,177 --> 00:23:50,679
Thirty-eight Fahrenheit.

436
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,304
Really cold.

437
00:23:54,224 --> 00:23:58,061
This is probably the most insane thing
I've been asked to do for goop...

438
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:02,399
is to jump in the most cold water

439
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:04,234
in a bathing suit
in the middle of winter.

440
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:06,945
So, yeah. Here I am.

441
00:24:07,904 --> 00:24:10,699
- Come on.
- [Heaven] Ana! Come on, Ana!

442
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:12,744
- [Megan] You got it, Ana.
- Take your shoes off.

443
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:14,273
- [David] So jump...
- [Wim] Yes!

444
00:24:14,327 --> 00:24:15,996
- [Megan catcalls]
- Ready?

445
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:19,374
Breath in, go in, go out, breathe out.

446
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:23,962
- [Megan] Oh!
- [all shouting]

447
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:24,880
[Heaven] Yeah, Ana!

448
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,466
[shouting continuing]

449
00:24:27,549 --> 00:24:30,760
It was so freaking cold.

450
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:34,097
Like, if I didn't have
the breathing techniques

451
00:24:34,181 --> 00:24:35,599
and didn't breath the whole time,

452
00:24:35,682 --> 00:24:37,893
I would have not been able to move.

453
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:41,813
Breathe in, go in, come out, breathe out.

454
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:45,525
Okay. One, two... [inhales]

455
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:50,989
[Wim] Long breaths. Long breaths!

456
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:55,452
[Sara] Once I got in, I just felt like
I was drowning, honestly.

457
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:58,705
It was just like...
it's so jarring and shocking,

458
00:24:58,788 --> 00:25:00,874
but I was like,
"Okay, I can move, I can swim.

459
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:02,518
So, if I can swim,
that means I can keep going."

460
00:25:02,542 --> 00:25:04,628
- [Wim] You got it. Go!
- And use mind over matter

461
00:25:04,711 --> 00:25:07,547
- to get through it.
- [Wim] Give it a smile. Come on!

462
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,925
- Yes. Beautiful.
- [Megan] You got it.

463
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:11,176
[Wim] Right over here.

464
00:25:12,135 --> 00:25:13,178
Make your jump.

465
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:15,639
Okay, I'm just gonna go right here.

466
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,474
- [Megan] You got this, Heaven.
- All right.

467
00:25:17,557 --> 00:25:20,037
- [David] You got this, Heaven.
- There you go. Last breath in.

468
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,688
[cheering]

469
00:25:24,147 --> 00:25:27,192
[Wim] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

470
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:31,988
Whenever you're ready,
breathe in, go.

471
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:34,449
Come out, breathe out.

472
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:38,370
[cheering]

473
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:40,789
[Wim] Yeah! Feel that force.

474
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,958
Control! Beautiful!

475
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:46,211
Horse stance over there. Horse stance.

476
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,845
Good, good!

477
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,933
[Wim grunting]

478
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,102
- [Wim shouts]
- [all cheering]

479
00:26:02,185 --> 00:26:04,354
[Megan] Right here. I'm right here!

480
00:26:04,938 --> 00:26:08,567
- Yeah, come on. Yes. Well done.
- [Megan] You got it, Kate.

481
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,127
- [Heaven] Come on, girl.
- Yes, you got it.

482
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:11,631
- You got it.
- [David] Come on, Kate.

483
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:13,697
- [Wim] You got it.
- [Heaven] You got this.

484
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:18,368
Looking at the lake, it was like,
a pretty massive "Oh, fuck" moment.

485
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:21,705
Like,
disbelief that I'm actually doing this.

486
00:26:22,581 --> 00:26:24,749
Kate, it's your moment.

487
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:27,502
Take a minute.

488
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,963
- [shouting]
- [cheering]

489
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:33,550
- [Wim] Kate, good job!
- [David] Yeah, Kate!

490
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,844
[Wim] Good job, Kate. Beautiful!

491
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,555
I started to kind of feel...

492
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:43,226
like, a panic attack coming on,
but I tried to breath through it,

493
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:46,479
and I just kind of controlled myself
and powered through it.

494
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:48,106
[cheering]

495
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:50,900
[Wim] Long breaths. Long breaths.

496
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,986
What did the water feel like to you?

497
00:26:53,069 --> 00:26:56,323
I mean, it feels like jumping
into a fucking cold lake. I mean...

498
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,240
[laughing]

499
00:26:57,324 --> 00:27:00,118
It's exactly
what you think it would feel like.

500
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:02,245
And then, you actually do it,

501
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,348
and you live through it,
and you survive it,

502
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:07,459
and you feel really, really good after.

503
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:09,461
[cheering]

504
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:12,130
That's dedication, that's teamwork,

505
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:15,675
tribal, like a family,
very strong together,

506
00:27:15,967 --> 00:27:19,179
helping each other, synergy. Power!

507
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:20,680
[shouting]

508
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:29,314
[cheering]

509
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:36,988
It's freezing outside, and I...
I wasn't cold.

510
00:27:37,072 --> 00:27:41,076
And it just sort of makes me think
that a lot is in my head.

511
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,453
It's crazy that I have control, basically.

512
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,832
- [Wim shouting]
- [cheering]

513
00:27:52,629 --> 00:27:54,089
Get back in business.

514
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,300
Love for the day, lust for life.

515
00:27:57,384 --> 00:27:59,135

516

517
00:28:00,804 --> 00:28:04,015
- That was, like, next level shit.
- Yeah.

518
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:05,684
That was incredible.

519
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:08,436
You guys did great. Bloody great.

520
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,313
- Awesome.
- [Heaven] Oh, thank you so much.

521
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:11,773
- Oh, man.
- Yeah, thanks, great.

522
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:15,402
You have been showing
that you are a master over your anxiety.

523
00:28:16,361 --> 00:28:18,321
- [Heaven] Yeah.
- Especially Kate.

524
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:21,157
- You killed it. You killed it.
- You weren't even anxious.

525
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:24,369
- You can be a proud mother now.
- I feel like that was like...

526
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:27,664
Like a change...
Not to, like, sound dramatic,

527
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:30,208
but I feel like that was, like,
a changing point in my life.

528
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,461
- Like, that jump was like a...
- How about that?

529
00:28:34,129 --> 00:28:36,005
A jump into the depth of yourself.

530
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:38,633
- Yeah. I really hope so.
- And controlled it.

531
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:39,819
- I hope that is.
- No, you did.

532
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:43,304
- You did, and you will see. You will see.
- I hope that it, like, stays.

533
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:45,515
I don't know if my panic disorder's
gonna go away.

534
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,278
I don't know
if my anxiety's gonna go away,

535
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:51,062
but it was definitely, um,
a turning point.

536
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:55,066
I haven't had a panic attack
since that experience.

537
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:57,444
- I say yes to that.
- [giggles]

538
00:28:57,527 --> 00:28:59,028
- [Gwyneth] That's amazing.
- Yeah.

539
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,531
I started tapering off my medication.

540
00:29:01,614 --> 00:29:04,802
- Your psychiatrist is working with you...
- Yeah, I'm working with my psychiatrist

541
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,245
- to slowly taper off.
- Are you doing the breath work still?

542
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:08,830
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

543
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:12,375
And then I finish with 30, 45 seconds
of a cold shower.

544
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:15,712
It's become like a ritual,
and it feels very empowering.

545
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:16,838
[Gwyneth, Elise] Hmm.

546
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:19,966
I want to start doing that.
I love taking cold showers sometimes.

547
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:23,803
I think a lot of our anxiety comes from,
it's a control thing.

548
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,680
And this was taking the control back.

549
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:30,018
And now you understand
that you can control your body.

550
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,329
- Even the ritual of a cold shower,
- [Kate] Yes, exactly.

551
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:33,813
you tell yourself...

552
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,399
- "I'm in control of this."
- Exactly.

553
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,359
- That's amazing.
- [Wim] Amazing, is that?

554
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:42,655
The right breathing techniques are able
to bring us very deep insight

555
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:47,410
with much more control
over our mood regulation

556
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:49,412
and our performance.

557
00:29:49,496 --> 00:29:51,539
Would you come with me...

558
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,416
- Yeah.
- ...to do push-ups?

559
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:57,170
I can't do a push-up. On this fast?

560
00:29:57,253 --> 00:30:00,048
I can barely walk from point A to point B.

561
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:04,302
All I can say is I know she's fasting,
and she says she can't do push-ups.

562
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:06,262
She's still gonna do
more push-ups than I...

563
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,656
- She's stronger than I am.
- No, I'm not.

564
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:08,598
- [Elise] Yes, you are.
- [laughs]

565
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,141
Let's do this breathing

566
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:13,353
and see how many push-ups
you guys can do.

567
00:30:13,436 --> 00:30:15,188
- Oh, my God.
- Okay.

568
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:26,366
[Wim] We are going to do push-ups...

569
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:28,326
- Okay.
- ...and then we are going to

570
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,411
do the breathing exercises,

571
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:33,122
which makes the muscle tissue alkaline

572
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:36,417
and therefore, is suddenly able
to do more push-ups,

573
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:38,878
even without air in your lungs.

574
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,505
Okay.

575
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:41,756
How many do we do?

576
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:42,858
- As many as we can?
- [Wim] Yes.

577
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:46,010
Just go. Go as much as you feel.

578
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,476
[Elise laughs] Aren't you tired yet?

579
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:56,980
- Doing good, ladies. Yes. All right.
- [Elise grunts, laughing]

580
00:30:59,357 --> 00:31:02,026
I think I did maybe 14 or 15.

581
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:04,279
All right, Gwyneth.

582
00:31:04,904 --> 00:31:08,324
- She is strong as fuck.
- Okay, 20. There. That's...

583
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:09,868
And she is fasting.

584
00:31:10,326 --> 00:31:13,037
- That's why I said this is embarrassing.
- That's strong.

585
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,290
- All right, 20.
- [chuckling]

586
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:18,835
[Wim] Twenty and 14.
Those are the numbers.

587
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,797
- I don't think I can do any more push-ups.
- [laughs]

588
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:24,966
You give the best, you get the best.

589
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,510
Just do that.

590
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,596
You give the best, you get the best.

591
00:31:31,055 --> 00:31:31,890
Okay.

592
00:31:31,973 --> 00:31:33,016

593
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:36,769

- Letting go.

603

Stop after the exhalation.

604
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:06,424
Stop breathing and push-ups.

605
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,847
Just go. Don't mind. Feel.

Four, five, six...

607
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,520
Whenever you feel the urge to breathe,

608
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:22,732
you can take an inhale and keep on going.

00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,424
I feel good.

618
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,551
My arms are tired,
but I'm not even out of breath.

619
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:52,595
I'm not out of breath, either,
I don't think.

620
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:54,847
I thought I was
gonna pass out for a minute

621
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:57,183
- when we were doing the breathing...
- [Wim] Yeah.

622
00:32:57,308 --> 00:33:00,186
...and then it kind of passed. You know?

623
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:04,565
So, it's like you're just focused
on the breath

624
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:08,319
- and not fainting. [laughs]
- [Wim] Yes.

625

No, I feel so.

We are here in the present,
feeling strong.
