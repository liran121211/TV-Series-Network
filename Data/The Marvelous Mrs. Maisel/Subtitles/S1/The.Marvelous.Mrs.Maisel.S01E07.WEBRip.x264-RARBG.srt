1
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,844
Mama? Esther's in a clean diaper
and Ethan is fed.

2
00:00:09,885 --> 00:00:11,554
I'll be home around 5:00.

3
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:13,556
Oh, man.

4
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:15,015
Mama?

5
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:16,434
Well, you're not
pulling hard enough.

6
00:00:16,475 --> 00:00:17,977
Half on the floor,
half on the carpet.

7
00:00:18,018 --> 00:00:20,396
- Lift, then, lift.
- What happened here?

8
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:22,940
Oh. Well, Zelda must've moved
the beds together to clean

9
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:24,316
and never pulled them apart.

10
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:25,985
- I'll talk to her.
- It's not like her.

11
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:27,278
It's definitely not like her.

12
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:28,487
Well, I'm off.

13
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:30,281
His first big day at Bell Labs.

14
00:00:30,322 --> 00:00:31,741
Have fun, Papa.

15
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:33,409
It's not about fun.
It's about the future.

16
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:35,369
And I'm going to take
a shower, hmm.

17
00:00:35,411 --> 00:00:37,371
I'll be home the same time
tonight, Rose.

18
00:00:37,413 --> 00:00:41,333
Okay. Have a nice day.

19
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,836
So, this morning,
I witnessed the aftermath

20
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:45,796
of my parents' sex night.

21
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:49,675
I caught them pulling
the twin beds back apart.

22
00:00:49,717 --> 00:00:51,343
And, you know,
I heard that scraping noise

23
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:52,928
in the middle of the night
when I was a kid,

24
00:00:52,970 --> 00:00:54,722
and I was scared to death
that it was a ghost.

25
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:57,808
So, thanks for the memories,
Mom and Dad.

26
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:00,895
I always thought it was a ghost,

27
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:03,105
but now I know it was something
much scarier:

28
00:01:03,147 --> 00:01:04,732
my parents' sex life.

29
00:01:04,774 --> 00:01:06,442
Thanks a lot, Mom and Dad.

30
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:11,530
But now I know it was something
much scarier than a ghost.

31
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:14,408
It was my parents' sex life.

32
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:16,702
No, for years, I'd-I'd
embarrass myself at Halloween

33
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:18,037
because the other kids
would be making ghost noises

34
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:21,040
like, "Ooh, ooh!"

35
00:01:21,081 --> 00:01:24,710
And I'd be going...

36
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:32,593
Mommy, why is
that man's pants lumpy?

37
00:01:32,635 --> 00:01:35,137
Question that really
needs to be asked is

38
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:38,891
why is my son looking
at lumps in men's pants?

39
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:40,810
A little boy is only
three and a half feet tall,

40
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:42,686
so all the time he's waiting
for Mommy to answer,

41
00:01:42,728 --> 00:01:45,731
he's stuck there at lump level.

42
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:47,900
Train stops, he's bumping up
against the thing.

43
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:49,568
Oh, a little boy

44
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,320
bumping up against an erection
crossed a line?

45
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:52,738
Okay.

46
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:55,241
It was a test. You passed.

47
00:01:55,282 --> 00:01:57,034
Uncomfortable, right?

48
00:01:57,076 --> 00:01:59,078
But the good thing about kids is
that when they ask a question,

49
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:00,871
they don't really listen
to the answer.

50
00:02:00,913 --> 00:02:02,832
So, when my son asks something
uncomfortable like,

51
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:05,334
"Why doesn't Daddy
live here anymore?"

52
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:09,088
I just say, "Yes. Howdy Doody
is a real boy."

53
00:02:13,467 --> 00:02:16,011
Thank you. Please come again.

54
00:02:16,053 --> 00:02:17,972
Good afternoon.
How may I help you?

55
00:02:18,013 --> 00:02:21,016
Yes, I want something that'll
make my wife look like...

56
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,893
...Elizabeth Taylor.

57
00:02:22,935 --> 00:02:25,104
So, I pointed him
to the sunglass department.

58
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:28,399
...Elizabeth Taylor.

59
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,193
And I wanted to say to him,
"Sir, look in a mirror.

60
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:33,487
"Would someone who looks like
Elizabeth Taylor come home

61
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,781
to someone who looks like you?"

62
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,701
...Elizabeth Taylor.

63
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:40,411
I wanted to say to him,
"I hope she's out shopping

64
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:42,997
for something that makes you
look like Rock Hudson."

65
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:45,916
...Elizabeth Taylor.

66
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,460
So, I asked for all the money
in his wallet and said,

67
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:49,837
"There. Now at least
it'll feel like

68
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:51,130
you're married
to Elizabeth Taylor."

69
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,851
You have a tight ten.

70
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:05,561
I mean, you are a woman
with a tight ten.

71
00:03:05,603 --> 00:03:07,146
I'm getting cheesecake.

72
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:08,355
People were peeing
their pants tonight.

73
00:03:08,397 --> 00:03:09,815
We're gonna need
to buy a new mop.

74
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:11,817
Couldn't even hear myself
over the laughs.

75
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,277
I timed you tonight.

76
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,112
With laughs, it came
to just over 11 minutes.

77
00:03:15,154 --> 00:03:16,572
You have a tight 11.

78
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:18,532
I'm a tenth of the way
to my second tight ten.

79
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:20,576
Most comics take years to work
up those first ten minutes.

80
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:21,660
You did it in months.

81
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:22,786
Feels like years.

82
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,997
You're really good.

83
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:27,249
Ah, gee, thanks.

84
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,168
No, Miriam, I mean...

85
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,211
you're really good.

86
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:34,423
Do not make me cry
at the Stage Deli.

87
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:36,800
I don't want you to fucking cry.
You're starting to cry.

88
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:38,344
- I'm not starting to cry.
- You are, too,

89
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,179
starting to cry and
that's gonna make me cry.

90
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:41,972
Shit, there's, like,
water on my face.

91
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:43,474
Those are tears.

92
00:03:43,515 --> 00:03:45,184
What does this look like?
You got a mirror?

93
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:47,728
You look kind of wet
and out of focus,

94
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:49,396
like-like a Doris Day picture.

95
00:03:49,438 --> 00:03:50,481
Christ.

96
00:03:50,522 --> 00:03:51,732
Give me a napkin.

97
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:56,028
People are looking.

98
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,446
Stop looking at me!

99
00:03:57,488 --> 00:03:59,198
- Susie.
- Get back to your kippers!

100
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:01,825
Let's just eat.
They'll stop looking.

101
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:03,786
- Check, please.
- Check.

102
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,704
So, you know
what this means, right?

103
00:04:05,746 --> 00:04:07,247
No, what's it mean?

104
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:08,916
It's time to leave the nest.

105
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,584
You mean tour? I can't tour.

106
00:04:10,626 --> 00:04:12,753
Mm, you're not ready to tour...
I'm just talking about gigs

107
00:04:12,795 --> 00:04:14,922
at other clubs in the city,
wherever I can book you.

108
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:17,007
Different venues, different
audiences... it's the next step.

109
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:19,093
Y-You got to leave
the Gaslight sometime.

110
00:04:19,134 --> 00:04:21,011
But I like the Gaslight.

111
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:23,806
- I know you do.
- It feels like home.

112
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:26,308
It'll still be there after
we kick big-time comedy ass

113
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,477
across all five boroughs.

114
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:31,772
Okay. Let's kick
some big-time comedy ass

115
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:33,482
across all five boroughs.

116
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:35,693
I'm making some calls tonight.

117
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:37,403
And when I say five boroughs...

118
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,196
I don't mean
Staten Island or Queens.

119
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:40,948
- Right.
- Or the Bronx.

120
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,741
Not so much Brooklyn.

121
00:04:42,783 --> 00:04:44,910
- Just Manhattan.
- I got the gist.

122
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:49,873
Can I have a fry?

123
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:54,211
What a day, what a day!

124
00:04:54,253 --> 00:04:55,921
Shirley, was this
not a great day?

125
00:04:55,963 --> 00:04:57,965
It was a hell of a day.

126
00:04:58,007 --> 00:05:00,718
Joely, my boy, I want you
to know I'm very proud of you.

127
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:03,303
The way you stood up
in front of all those people...

128
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,222
You didn't sweat,
you didn't stumble.

129
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:07,725
Every single person
in the place was impressed.

130
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,810
- Thanks, Pop.
- You know, you get one chance

131
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:12,813
to throw a bar mitzvah,
so you got to get it right.

132
00:05:12,855 --> 00:05:15,482
And boy, oh, boy,
did we get it right!

133
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:17,943
How'd you like the size
of that hall, huh?

134
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:20,487
And the turnout...
200 people RSVP,

135
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,281
200 people show.

136
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,949
This is a big day!

137
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:25,743
It's a hell of a day!

138
00:05:25,784 --> 00:05:28,162
- Watch your mouth!
- And a great leap forward

139
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:29,663
for the family.

140
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:32,249
My God, boy,
just a few years ago

141
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,918
the Maisels were lugging
pushcarts in shtetls.

142
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,795
And look at us now...

143
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:39,214
On the verge of opening
our first factory,

144
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:42,301
hosting events
that people clamor to come to...

145
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,511
Important people!

146
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:45,929
Go ahead.

147
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:49,099
Tack the picture up
on the headboard there.

148
00:05:49,141 --> 00:05:52,102
Did you see
the looks on people's faces

149
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:55,189
when I told them that your
cousin, Sergeant Meyer Schultz,

150
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:58,525
piloted the plane
that struck that Jap battleship

151
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,652
three days after Pearl Harbor?!

152
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,654
Ah! They couldn't believe it.

153
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:05,074
- He's a hero.
- You bet he's a hero.

154
00:06:05,115 --> 00:06:07,868
And now, Joely,
I'm gonna come clean with you,

155
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:10,496
'cause you're 13
and you're a man now.

156
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,247
He's not your cousin.

157
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,291
- He's not?
- No, he was our paperboy,

158
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:16,335
and just this side of idiot.

159
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:18,337
See, it's all part
of the big picture...

160
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,090
The hall, the lavish buffet,
the fake cousin.

161
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,175
It's very important
that you show people

162
00:06:23,217 --> 00:06:25,094
you're bigger and better
than them.

163
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:28,305
Because if they think it,
then you'll be it.

164
00:06:28,347 --> 00:06:30,974
That's how you get ahead in
the world, become a conqueror.

165
00:06:31,016 --> 00:06:32,893
- Yes, sir.
- I want everyone to know

166
00:06:32,935 --> 00:06:34,895
that you, Joel Maisel,
are a conqueror.

167
00:06:34,937 --> 00:06:37,272
And today, in that temple,
in that banquet hall,

168
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,233
they learned.

169
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:41,902
And now... we got to pay for it.

170
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:43,946
You understand?

171
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:47,783
I could've just
gone down the street,

172
00:06:47,825 --> 00:06:50,536
thrown your bar mitzvah
in the room in the back

173
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:52,621
of your uncle's bowling alley.

174
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:54,665
We would've gotten it for free.

175
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,917
Free's good. We like free.

176
00:06:56,959 --> 00:07:00,295
But then, everyone who came
to that bowling alley,

177
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:04,216
with its stench of beer
and piss and lane oil,

178
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:06,885
they would have known
we got it for free,

179
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:09,513
and that is not acceptable.

180
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:11,807
No. Today these people walked in

181
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,934
thinking their Saturday's
been ruined

182
00:07:13,976 --> 00:07:16,353
by another stupid bar mitzvah,

183
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:19,481
The Maisels...

184
00:07:19,523 --> 00:07:22,734
are really going
to be something.

187
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,826
It's Mommy rooster.

188
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:32,661
Rise and shine, Joely.

189
00:07:32,703 --> 00:07:34,496
It's 7:00 in the a.m.

190
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:35,998
- Good morning, Ma.
- Look at that.

191
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:38,333
Another gorgeous sunshiny day.

192
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:41,336
- You should ride your bike.
- I don't ride bikes anymore, Ma.

193
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,172
Wear a hat.
You'll get a sunstroke.

194
00:07:43,213 --> 00:07:44,715
I'm not riding a bike, Ma.

195
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:46,925
Oh, it's been so nice
having my boychik home.

196
00:07:46,967 --> 00:07:48,927
Oh, I'll get
your father's boxes out of here.

197
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,221
- And the sewing machine, too.
- It's just temporary.

198
00:07:51,263 --> 00:07:53,056
Sure, temporary, temporary.

199
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:54,850
Ooh. I'm doing a load of whites.

200
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:56,602
Give me everything you got.

201
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:58,687
- All your poo-poo undies.
- You don't have to.

202
00:07:58,729 --> 00:08:00,689
Is this a girl's suitcase?

203
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:02,733
Ma, please.
I need to get ready for work.

204
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:05,569
Of course. I'll make you
a plate of yummy eggs.

205
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:06,904
Would you like that?

206
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,864
Sure. Make me a plate
of yummy eggs.

207
00:08:08,906 --> 00:08:10,574
Now, don't bother looking
under the bed

208
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:12,659
for the magazines you left
when you moved out.

209
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:14,661
I found them and threw them out.

210
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:15,996
Bad boy.

211
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:17,956
I don't want the magazines, Ma.

212
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:20,083
Eggs'll be ready in a jiff.

East Coast is exactly
where we want.

226
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:52,616
But the West Coast operation
is in disarray, and they say

227
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:54,910
- it's all due to supply.
- The chain is gridlocked,

228
00:08:54,952 --> 00:08:56,578
and it's not seasonal anymore,
it's year-round.

229
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,955
Dow Chemical's scrambling

230
00:08:57,996 --> 00:08:59,498
for supplies themselves...
Phenolic resin,

231
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,083
formaldehyde...
They can't get enough.

232
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:04,294
Just pour some formaldehyde on
a rag and hold it over my face.

233
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,296
Their chief scientists say there
are breakthroughs within sight,

234
00:09:06,338 --> 00:09:07,714
but that's all they'll say.

235
00:09:07,756 --> 00:09:09,383
"Within sight"?
That's nice and vague.

236
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:11,969
Any suggestions? -LAWRENCE:
There's nothing to do, boss,

237
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,428
except get in line
and wait our turn.

238
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,347
And hope we don't
go out of business first.

239
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,307
Excuse me?

240
00:09:18,350 --> 00:09:20,060
We can't just wait.

241
00:09:20,102 --> 00:09:21,853
Everything'll come
to a complete stop.

242
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,730
What do you suggest, Maisel?

243
00:09:23,772 --> 00:09:26,191
Let's acquire the supply.

244
00:09:26,233 --> 00:09:27,818
What was that?

245
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,488
We can't control
our supply of chemicals

246
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:33,490
if we can't control
the supplier.

247
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:35,784
So... let's become the supplier.

248
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:38,245
And how would that work?
We buy Union Carbide?

249
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:40,580
We start small, Curtis.

250
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,416
We acquire a local lab.

251
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,793
We dig through universities
for talent.

252
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:46,962
We got a few of those
in New York.

253
00:09:47,004 --> 00:09:50,007
A few. -We hire our own
technicians, our own scientists.

254
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,676
We build our own chain
and become our own suppliers.

255
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:54,303
They turn chemicals
into plastic,

256
00:09:54,344 --> 00:09:56,638
and we turn plastic
into toys and coasters.

257
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,850
Hell, let's make
the chemicals, too.

258
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:03,729
Life magazine says
conglomerates are the future.

259
00:10:05,105 --> 00:10:06,773
Francis, call Chase Manhattan.

260
00:10:06,815 --> 00:10:08,317
Let's take some baby steps.

261
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,777
Set up a line of credit,
see what's out there.

262
00:10:10,819 --> 00:10:13,196
And we need to call the
West Coast, give 'em a heads-up.

263
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:14,781
- Curtis, give 'em a buzz.
- Will do, boss.

264
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,366
We should send the CFO
out there, too.

265
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:17,993
As soon as possible.
Now, what else, guys?

266
00:10:18,035 --> 00:10:19,578
Just a couple
of personnel things.

267
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,372
Can you believe
our babies are turning four?

268
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,207
- They just turned three.
- They'll be in school

269
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,625
before you know it,
then college,

270
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:27,252
then marriage,
they'll have babies,

271
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:29,171
become grandparents...
We'll be dead by then.

272
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,839
- Yay.
- Sorry.

273
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,966
Wait. You put marbles in here.
I'm doing marbles.

274
00:10:33,008 --> 00:10:34,885
- I thought you were doing gum.
- And you're putting

275
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:36,636
Tiny Tina baby carriages
in the boys' bags.

276
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,972
Oh, I told you, we should get
gender-specific bags.

277
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:41,224
- Too much chatter.
- Sorry, Papa.

278
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:44,353
And what is all this? -It's
for Ethan's birthday party.

279
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,980
- This is too much for him.
- This is for the kids

280
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:49,107
- who come to the party.
- It's all their birthdays?

281
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:51,443
If everyone gets a gift, it'll
keep the screaming down. -So,

282
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,445
everyone gets a gift,
everyone gets a compliment,

283
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:55,739
everyone gets a hug...
You're not preparing

284
00:10:55,781 --> 00:10:58,116
- these kids for the real world.
- Don't worry,

285
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,118
we'll teach the kids how cruel
the world is next year,

286
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,329
when they're five. -Did you
need something, Mr. Weissman?

287
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,706
Yes. I need you to know
that I can hear

288
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:06,625
every word you're saying,
and I'm grading papers.

289
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,710
So please, Miriam, Dody...

290
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:11,046
try to keep it down.

291
00:11:11,088 --> 00:11:12,547
Okay.

292
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:16,009
Why does he call me Dody?

293
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,677
She was my friend growing up.

294
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:20,305
It's sort of a catchall
for whoever he sees me with.

295
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:21,848
Wait, there's
already gum in here.

296
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,642
- I put it in there.
- I'm doing gum.

297
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,852
But I thought you
were doing candy cigarettes.

298
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:27,646
Starting over.

299
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,317
So, we should finalize
the guest list.

300
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,444
- It's the same as last year.
- Is it?

301
00:11:34,486 --> 00:11:36,446
What's the confusion, Dody?

302
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:37,614
Is Joel coming?

303
00:11:37,656 --> 00:11:38,824
Of course he's coming...

304
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:40,242
It's his son's birthday.

305
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:41,785
Is he bringing her?

306
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:43,870
Only if he wants
to be beaten to death

307
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:45,789
by, I don't know,
everyone at the party.

308
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:48,583
Okay. But we'd better figure out
who knows what, compare stories.

309
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,627
Stories? -The stories
you've each been telling people

310
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:52,587
about your situation...
I've completely lost track.

311
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,590
And I have no idea
what you've been telling people.

312
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:58,635
Every word, as if broadcast
over a microphone.

313
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:01,513
- We're almost done.
- You keep starting over.

314
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:02,889
She talked me
out of gender-specific bags,

315
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,225
Mr. Weissman.

316
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:08,186
Set up a line like Henry Ford.

317
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,855
Keep the piles separate,

318
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:11,940
then pass the bags
from one to the other.

319
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:13,900
Candy cigarettes, pass the bag,

320
00:12:13,942 --> 00:12:15,861
a Silly Putty,
pass the bag, and so on.

321
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,946
Thanks for
the industrial education, Papa.

322
00:12:17,988 --> 00:12:19,948
And, young lady,
I heard through the door

323
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:22,159
that your name is not Dody...
What is your name?

324
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,452
Imogene.

325
00:12:23,493 --> 00:12:25,912
I'm not gonna remember that.

326
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,709
The Murphys... do they know all?

327
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:33,712
I'm not sure. I-I lied
to some people at first,

328
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:35,547
then started telling people
that we were separated

329
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:37,966
- but trying to work it out.
- The Turners?

330
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:40,719
Think that Joel is
on a business trip in Poland.

331
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:43,013
- The Rivingtons?
- Know that you're separated

332
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:45,098
and know that Joel moved out.
Someone got to them before me.

333
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,100
But they don't know
that Joel's living with Penny.

334
00:12:47,142 --> 00:12:49,186
He's not living with Penny
anymore.

335
00:12:49,227 --> 00:12:50,312
What? Since when?

336
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:51,521
Joel's secretary called.

337
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:52,939
Gave me a new home number
for him.

338
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:54,441
It was his parents'.

339
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:55,442
What happened?

340
00:12:55,484 --> 00:12:56,693
I don't know.

341
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:58,111
Wow.

342
00:12:58,153 --> 00:12:59,696
As the world turns.

343
00:12:59,738 --> 00:13:01,490
- Mm-hmm.
- So,

344
00:13:01,531 --> 00:13:03,742
who else? Uh, the Gertzs.

345
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:06,578
Think that Joel is
on a very long business trip

346
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,914
- but suspect more.
- The Salings?

347
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:10,832
Think that we are
renovating the apartment

348
00:13:10,874 --> 00:13:13,168
and that Joel is traveling
for work.

349
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,469
Mm.

350
00:13:26,806 --> 00:13:28,099
What the hell?

351
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,768
Harry, good. Can we talk?

352
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:31,186
Oh, Susie. Sure.

353
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:33,021
Hey, uh, guys,
can you give us the room?

354
00:13:33,063 --> 00:13:34,856
Susie needs to talk to me.

355
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:36,316
You don't have to clear
the room.

356
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:37,984
I'm not gonna clear
the goddamn room.

357
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:39,653
Jesus Christ, Susie,
get a phone.

358
00:13:39,694 --> 00:13:42,239
- I have a phone.
- Well, use it.

359
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,157
But face-to-face is better.
That's what you always said.

360
00:13:44,199 --> 00:13:45,158
Don't listen to me.

361
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,743
Oh, so smooth.

362
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:48,912
It's like a baby's bottom.

363
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:50,330
And so fragrant.

364
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:52,249
Okay, okay.

365
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,084
Tell me why you're here.

366
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,002
The comic I told you about,
the one I'm representing.

367
00:13:56,044 --> 00:13:57,754
- The girl?
- Yeah, the girl.

368
00:13:57,796 --> 00:14:00,173
She's been killing at
the Gaslight, night after night.

369
00:14:00,215 --> 00:14:01,174
What's her name again?

370
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:02,676
It's Amanda Gleason.

371
00:14:02,717 --> 00:14:03,802
Shit name.

372
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:05,637
Fake name but a great comic.

373
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,973
She'd be the perfect opening act
for Sophie Lennon.

374
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:11,142
Get out of here. Sophie's one
of my biggest clients. -I know.

375
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,395
Where do you come off,
asking for something like this?

376
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:16,273
I'm not talking about opening
for her at the Copa. -Then what?

377
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:17,774
Sophie plays those joints
in Jersey

378
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,109
when she's working up a new act.

379
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,944
Those little dives, unannounced.

380
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:22,779
Let my girl open for her there.

381
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:24,030
- Really?
- Yeah.

382
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:25,365
That's a shit gig.

383
00:14:25,407 --> 00:14:26,783
It's a terrible gig.

384
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,326
The audience is there
for Sophie.

385
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,662
- The opener gets eaten alive.
- We're game.

386
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,914
Slot went to Markie Diamond
once. You hear of him?

387
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:34,499
- No.
- And to Adam Young once.

388
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,792
- You hear of him?
- No.

389
00:14:35,834 --> 00:14:37,210
Danny LeMonde? Scoop LeMonde?

390
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:38,920
- Brothers?
- They're in plumbing now.

391
00:14:38,962 --> 00:14:41,590
- I get the point.
- She'd be a sacrificial lamb.

392
00:14:41,631 --> 00:14:44,342
Then cut her up into chops
and serve her with mint sauce.

393
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,594
I want this for her.

394
00:14:45,635 --> 00:14:47,345
I'd need to see her first.

395
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,763
She's got a tight ten.

396
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,473
I can set you up any night
you like.

397
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:52,475
- I'm not going to the Gaslight.
- Why not?

398
00:14:52,517 --> 00:14:53,893
I don't go downtown anymore.

399
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,895
You cut your teeth
haunting dives downtown.

400
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,147
I got nice suits now.

401
00:14:57,188 --> 00:14:58,773
Why you wearing this one?

402
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:01,234
The Stork Club is as south
as I want to go.

403
00:15:01,276 --> 00:15:02,485
She'll perform anywhere
you want,

404
00:15:02,527 --> 00:15:04,195
but the Gaslight's her home.

405
00:15:05,822 --> 00:15:07,907
It's a really shit gig.

406
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,327
She's gonna bomb.

407
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:13,955
Put that on your plate!

408
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:16,541
Yeah, I'm from Queens,

409
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,209
born and raised.

410
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:21,046
Queens is the place you go
to get to the airport...

411
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:23,423
to get the hell out of Queens.

412
00:15:23,465 --> 00:15:26,259
Put that on your plate. Ugh.

413
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:29,095
In Queens, we got a neighborhood
called Flushing,

414
00:15:29,137 --> 00:15:31,765
which isn't a name
so much as a suggestion

415
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:33,850
for what to do with the place.

416
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:37,395
Put that on your plate!

417
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:40,398
You know, sometimes
when I'm on the telephone

418
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,942
and I say my name,
Sophie Lennon,

419
00:15:42,984 --> 00:15:46,696
people think they hear
"Sophia Loren." Mm. -

420
00:15:46,738 --> 00:15:49,532
Funny, nobody ever makes
that mistake in person.

421
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,203
You hear those laughs?

422
00:15:53,244 --> 00:15:54,788
They're big laughs.

423
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,706
Are you sure my stuff
is funny enough for Harry?

424
00:15:56,748 --> 00:15:59,042
Positive. Why? Aren't you sure?

425
00:15:59,084 --> 00:16:01,294
- I'm pretty sure.
- Pretty sure?

426
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:04,381
I went out on a limb for you
here, sister, so be damn sure.

427
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:06,383
I'm... damn sure, okay?

428
00:16:06,424 --> 00:16:09,052
I mean, really.

429
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:11,221
Yeah, I like to eat!

430
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:14,140
I'm so fat...

431
00:16:14,182 --> 00:16:15,809
How fat are you?

432
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:19,145
I'm so fat
that I used to look Rubenesque,

433
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:22,524
and now I just look
like a Reuben sandwich.

434
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:27,529
I grew up listening
to this woman on the radio.

435
00:16:27,570 --> 00:16:29,864
- Me, too.
- Even my dad laughed at her.

436
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,449
He tried not to, but he did.

437
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,119
She got a lot of us
through the Depression.

438
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,787
How old are you?

439
00:16:35,829 --> 00:16:37,956
I'm not telling you.

440
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,791
I can't even go to the beach
anymore.

441
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,626
Last time I was at the beach,

442
00:16:41,668 --> 00:16:44,713
some marine biology students
started poking me with a stick,

443
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:46,548
looking for my blowhole!

444
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:49,884
I walked by a construction site,

445
00:16:49,926 --> 00:16:52,971
and the workers start whistling
at each other!

446
00:16:54,347 --> 00:16:56,224
Should I talk about my husbands?

447
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:00,186
All right then.
You asked for it.

448
00:17:00,228 --> 00:17:03,523
Oh, my first husband and me,
we didn't get along too good.

449
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:05,525
He was too proper.

450
00:17:05,567 --> 00:17:07,694
He spoke the Queen's English,

451
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:11,281
whereas I spoke Queens' English.

452
00:17:11,322 --> 00:17:12,532
Bop!

453
00:17:17,662 --> 00:17:21,249
Oh! Put that on your plate!

454
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:27,964
Here you go.

455
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,716
What's your name, sweetie?

456
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:31,217
Linda. I'm from Queens, too.

457
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:34,053
Oh, Linda,
you have my deepest sympathies.

458
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,889
There you go.

459
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,391
- Hello, my loves.
- I'm an enormous fan.

460
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:41,144
How 'bout that? I'm
an enormous comedian. -Harry.

461
00:17:41,186 --> 00:17:43,396
There you go, honey.

462
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:44,814
- Enjoy.
- Hello, Susie.

463
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,983
Oh, thanks for putting on
your fancy duds.

464
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:49,152
Shows a lot of respect
for the occasion here.

465
00:17:49,194 --> 00:17:50,987
Listen, I know it's late
and you have a catheter

466
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:53,406
that needs changing, so let me
introduce you to my girl.

467
00:17:53,448 --> 00:17:54,657
- This is...
- Amanda Gleason.

468
00:17:54,699 --> 00:17:56,409
- Amanda Gleason.
- Nice to meet you.

469
00:17:56,451 --> 00:17:58,411
- You like the show?
- I loved it.

470
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:00,330
She's hysterical.
She's timeless.

471
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,831
She's the best in the biz.

472
00:18:01,873 --> 00:18:04,042
Let me introduce you. Sophie.

473
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,543
- Yeah.
- Excuse me.

474
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,630
Oh, hey, don't worry.
I'll be back.

475
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,841
Sophie, this is Susie Myerson
and Amanda Gleason.

476
00:18:11,883 --> 00:18:13,676
Amanda may be opening for you

477
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,470
- in Jersey.
- Nice to meet you.

478
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:17,347
- Ah, Sophie don't shake hands.
- Oh.

479
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:20,016
Sophie shakes bodies. Come here, you.
Oh. Oh.

480
00:18:20,058 --> 00:18:22,435
Harry, make sure

481
00:18:22,477 --> 00:18:24,479
you cheat toward
this adorable young thing.

482
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:26,397
- Oh.
- I will.

483
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:29,067
So, you're gonna be the appetizer, huh?
I'm hoping.

484
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:30,902
Well, it's a tough gig.
They tell you that?

485
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:33,321
- They did. I'm game.
- Good for you.

486
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:35,073
Why don't you come over
to my house this week.

487
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,075
I like to get to know
my acolytes.

488
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,326
I'm at your disposal.

489
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,328
Harry, set it up.

490
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,622
Look at those beauty-ful people.

491
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:45,458
So long, all!

492
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,252
Come here, my darlings.

493
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:48,670
Susie, I'll be in touch.

494
00:18:48,711 --> 00:18:50,672
- Thanks, Harry.
- Okay.

495
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,300
Oh! Where'd you get that hat?

496
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,514
There's still lumps in there,
Zelda. They all have to go.

497
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:01,599
Yes, ma'am. -It's not
just about what he can chew.

498
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:04,602
- Every lump is a choking hazard.
- Who's at risk of choking?

499
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:07,021
Your father's bringing Mordecai
Glickman home for dinner.

500
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:09,941
Professor Glickman? He was
an old man when I was a kid.

501
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:12,360
He still is. -He had no liver
when I was a kid.

502
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:14,195
He still doesn't.

503
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:16,114
- Too firm. Lose the peaches.
- Yes, ma'am.

504
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,366
You're eating with us? Please
say you're eating with us.

505
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:20,952
I was planning on it. -Your
father especially wanted you

506
00:19:20,994 --> 00:19:22,620
to eat with us.

507
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:24,622
- Too stringy. Lose the yams.
- Yes, ma'am.

508
00:19:24,664 --> 00:19:26,708
Grab some bowls. They'll want
to eat as soon as they come in,

509
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:28,877
before Mordecai falls asleep.

510
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:32,839
So, remember,

511
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:35,174
he's got 90% hearing loss
in his left ear,

512
00:19:35,216 --> 00:19:37,343
and his right ear
is completely deaf.

513
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:40,179
- So yell into his left ear.
- And sometimes he sees stars

514
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:42,015
in front of his eyes
and he'll comment on them.

515
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,683
He'll say, "Look at all
the pretty stars, everyone."

516
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,852
- Just go along.
- We're all seeing pretty stars.

517
00:19:45,894 --> 00:19:48,438
Mm. -Is it okay if I seat
Professor Glickman here, ma'am?

518
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,773
Oh, he shouldn't sit there.
If he falls, he'll hit his head

519
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,609
- on the mirror.
- But if he falls over there,

520
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,611
he'll hit his head on the drink cart.

521
00:19:54,652 --> 00:19:57,113
I should have had Abe tell me
which way he was tilting today.

522
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:58,364
Have some pillows handy.

523
00:19:58,406 --> 00:20:00,450
Hello!

524
00:20:00,491 --> 00:20:02,493
We're here!

525
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,164
Abe?

526
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,833
Rose, this is David Blumenthal.

527
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:10,835
David, this is my wife, Rose.

528
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:12,337
Nice to meet you, Mrs. Weissman.

529
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,672
- Likewise.
- And this is my daughter,

530
00:20:14,714 --> 00:20:17,383
- Miriam.
- Very nice to meet you, Miriam.

531
00:20:17,425 --> 00:20:19,928
Nice to meet you, too,
Mr. Blumenthal.

532
00:20:19,969 --> 00:20:21,179
Please, call me David.

533
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:23,514
David.

534
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,934
Zelda, why don't you take
Mr. Blumenthal's coat.

535
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:26,976
Yes, ma'am.

536
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:30,563
This is not Professor Glickman.

537
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:32,023
- Of course it isn't.
- I thought

538
00:20:32,065 --> 00:20:33,733
you were bringing home
Professor Glickman.

539
00:20:33,775 --> 00:20:35,652
I said "a colleague,"
not "Professor Glickman."

540
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,320
David, please join us
in the living room.

541
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:39,155
We can chat a bit before dinner.

542
00:20:39,197 --> 00:20:41,908
Mmm, this looks...

543
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:43,159
charmingly eclectic.

544
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,661
Is this dinner, Rose?

545
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:46,412
It's dinner
for Mordecai Glickman.

546
00:20:46,454 --> 00:20:48,831
I wasn't aware you were bringing
home someone with teeth.

547
00:20:48,873 --> 00:20:51,000
Well, David,

548
00:20:51,042 --> 00:20:52,251
would you like a drink?

549
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:54,671
We have... peppermint schnapps.

550
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:57,090
Rose, why is there
just peppermint schnapps?

551
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:58,716
It's what Professor Glickman
drinks.

552
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,343
I have scotch somewhere.

553
00:21:00,385 --> 00:21:02,512
I'm fine, thank you.
I don't need a drink.

554
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:05,014
I hope you like applesauce and
peach slices, Mr. Blumenthal.

555
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:07,058
- I like whatever you're serving.
- Good, because that's what

556
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,978
applesauce and
peach slices and mashed potatoes

557
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:12,397
and consommÃ© and hard-boiled
eggs and pureed cauliflower

558
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:13,940
and pudding for dessert.

559
00:21:13,982 --> 00:21:15,358
Your teeth will wonder
what they're there for.

560
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:17,360
Miriam, will you help me
in the kitchen, please?

561
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:19,028
Mm.

562
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:21,739
Excuse me.

563
00:21:23,366 --> 00:21:26,828
So, David, which part
of Westchester are you from?

564
00:21:28,121 --> 00:21:29,956
What do we have
that's real food?

565
00:21:29,998 --> 00:21:32,041
I have steaks, but they're frozen.
This is a nightmare.

566
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,710
- The nerve of him.
- The nerve of him.

567
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:35,211
You said he was bringing home
Professor Glickman.

568
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:36,546
I said he was bringing home
a colleague,

569
00:21:36,587 --> 00:21:38,131
and it's always
Professor Glickman.

570
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:39,799
- Is this a set-up?
- Of course it's a set-up.

571
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:41,801
Why is he doing this?
Why is he trying to set me up

572
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:44,053
with some guy? -Your father's
nothing but a common souteneur.

573
00:21:44,095 --> 00:21:46,055
- A what?
- A pimp. Your father's a pimp.

574
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:48,725
He's not a pimp. -He's trying
to breed you, like a prize mare.

575
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:50,476
Just the presumption
of what he's doing.

576
00:21:50,518 --> 00:21:52,562
I'm so mad. -And this man
is not even attractive.

577
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:54,147
Well, he's not unattractive.

578
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:55,732
Oh, Miriam, you are not going
out with this man.

579
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,191
Of course I'm not going out
with this man.

580
00:21:57,233 --> 00:21:58,735
But you said he was attractive.

581
00:21:58,776 --> 00:21:59,944
I had a car for a while.

582
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,446
A '55 Bel Air.

583
00:22:01,487 --> 00:22:03,197
But the upkeep was enormous,

584
00:22:03,239 --> 00:22:05,616
and parking in the city's
murder, so...

585
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:08,119
Yes, well,
parking and upkeep is...

586
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:10,705
So you would encourage
your father to be a pimp? -Look,

587
00:22:10,747 --> 00:22:11,914
he's a lot of things,
but I don't think

588
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,166
it's fair to call him a pimp.

589
00:22:13,207 --> 00:22:14,167
Well, he's being a pimp.

590
00:22:14,208 --> 00:22:16,169
Upkeep is pretty onerous.

591
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,504
David, will you excuse me
a moment?

592
00:22:18,546 --> 00:22:20,631
The girls sound
a little... excited.

593
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,175
- Of course.
- So it's my fault?

594
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:24,510
I should have eaten
at the Automat tonight.

595
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:27,513
That's what I think. -Miriam, stop it.
What is going on?

596
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:29,891
We can hear every word you're saying.
Abe Weissman,

597
00:22:29,932 --> 00:22:32,268
what made you think you could
just bring a man home like this?

598
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,729
He's a colleague. I bring
colleagues home for dinner.

599
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:36,564
- He's not just a colleague.
- You brought him home

600
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:38,983
- to set him up with Miriam.
- I did no such thing.

601
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:42,195
Come on. -David Blumenthal
is a colleague at my school.

602
00:22:42,236 --> 00:22:44,030
- Is he a bachelor?
- I think so.

603
00:22:44,072 --> 00:22:46,783
Oh, Abe! -What, I can only
bring home married colleagues?

604
00:22:46,824 --> 00:22:48,534
Mm. -Come on,
you never bring anyone home,

605
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,787
and tonight you show up
with this attractive young guy?

606
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:52,872
- Semi-attractive.
- He's not unattractive.

607
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:55,291
- Which side are you on here?
- His looks have nothing to do

608
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:58,294
with this. Now, please,
can we get dinner on the table?

609
00:22:58,336 --> 00:22:59,378
Dinner's a disaster.

610
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,380
He says he's not picky.

611
00:23:01,422 --> 00:23:03,966
Oh, and Mordecai Glickman
is no longer with us.

612
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:06,969
Since when? -Since we went
to his funeral four years ago.

613
00:23:07,011 --> 00:23:08,137
That's right.
It was the liveliest

614
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:09,472
I'd seen Mordecai in years.

615
00:23:09,514 --> 00:23:11,516
Dinner, please.

616
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,644
You think
he's telling the truth?

617
00:23:14,685 --> 00:23:17,105
I don't know anything anymore.

618
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:22,401
Thursday is soft foods night

619
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:23,986
here at the Weissman home,
David.

620
00:23:24,028 --> 00:23:25,071
I hope you don't mind.

621
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:26,572
I'm anything but picky, Abe.

622
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:29,325
Please, everybody, sit.

623
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:41,379
So, David here
is a divorce lawyer.

624
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:48,344
David, can I dish you up
some peach slices?

625
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:50,721
- You said he was a colleague.
- I do teach law part-time.

626
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,932
- Shut up, David.
- She needs an attorney.

627
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:54,517
- She does not need an attorney.
- Maybe I should go.

628
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,352
Papa, this was not the time
or the place.

629
00:23:56,394 --> 00:23:58,104
Mr. Blumenthal, I'm afraid
my husband brought you here

630
00:23:58,146 --> 00:23:59,438
under false pretenses.

631
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,566
An informative colloquy
can't hurt.

632
00:24:01,607 --> 00:24:02,775
I can just leave my card
with you.

633
00:24:02,817 --> 00:24:03,901
She doesn't need your card.

634
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:04,902
Papa, can we...

635
00:24:04,944 --> 00:24:06,445
colloquy in your study, please?

636
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:07,446
The food will get cold.

637
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:08,698
It's already cold.

638
00:24:08,739 --> 00:24:10,741
- David, excuse us.
- I understand.

639
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,577
No, there's nothing for you
to understand, Mr. Blumenthal.

640
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:13,661
- Mm-mm.
- Rose,

641
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:15,454
please, my study.

642
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,587
Don't you dare pull paperwork
out of that briefcase of yours.

643
00:24:24,589 --> 00:24:27,717
Papa, you should have told me
you were doing this.

644
00:24:27,758 --> 00:24:31,053
We should not be in denial
about what's happening here.

645
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:32,638
Who are you to say that?

646
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,307
- I'm her father.
- For now.

647
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:36,058
What does that even mean?

648
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,561
And why would you think
I would bring someone home

649
00:24:38,603 --> 00:24:40,855
to set you up with? -Because
you're a common souteneur.

650
00:24:40,897 --> 00:24:43,232
- A what?
- A pimp. Papa, you're a pimp.

651
00:24:43,274 --> 00:24:44,901
I beg your pardon.

652
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:46,652
- Sounds better in French.
- I wouldn't set you up

653
00:24:46,694 --> 00:24:48,362
with anyone.
I don't even know your type.

654
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:51,115
- Joel's her type.
- Miriam doesn't have a type.

655
00:24:51,157 --> 00:24:52,783
My God, before Joel,

656
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,869
you were with that ultra white
Palmer Witherspoon.

657
00:24:54,911 --> 00:24:56,579
Oh, that name you remember?

658
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:58,539
He was like a pole-vaulter
from Triumph of the Will.

659
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:01,667
Papa, this is my concern,
not yours.

660
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:03,211
You're my daughter.

661
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:04,712
Your concerns are my concerns.

662
00:25:04,754 --> 00:25:06,923
Miriam and Joel
are not divorcing.

663
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:10,760
Rose, we need to talk
about this.

664
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:13,679
They live apart.
She has a job.

665
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:15,389
He moved in with that girl.

666
00:25:15,431 --> 00:25:18,559
No one at Ethan's party
has been told the same thing.

667
00:25:18,601 --> 00:25:21,270
It'll be 20 adults
all sitting six feet apart

668
00:25:21,312 --> 00:25:23,022
so they can't compare stories

669
00:25:23,064 --> 00:25:26,192
with Dody running interference.

670
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:29,862
Things need to move on.

671
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:31,989
Miriam needs to be settled.

672
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:35,534
And that means
they need to divorce.

673
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:37,411
I don't want to
talk about this anymore.

674
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,747
Now I'm gonna go to the kitchen
and grab some celery

675
00:25:39,789 --> 00:25:42,208
because we all need
something fibrous to eat.

676
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,131

Rose.

688

Privacy, please.

689
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,686
We need to talk.

690
00:26:43,728 --> 00:26:45,646
You bring that man home.

691
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:47,440
A lawyer.

692
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:49,692
I could strangle you.

693
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:51,235
I want to tell you something.

694
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:53,571
Well, tell it to your colleague.

695
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:56,532
You need to know... Rose!

696
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:03,789
You need to know
about Miriam and Joel.

697
00:27:03,831 --> 00:27:05,833
What about them?

698
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:10,129
Joel is not going to come back.

699
00:27:10,171 --> 00:27:11,547
How do you know?

700
00:27:11,589 --> 00:27:15,760
Because he already did...
come back.

701
00:27:15,801 --> 00:27:18,429
And she turned him away.

702
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:20,264
"She" who?

703
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:21,515
Miriam.

704
00:27:21,557 --> 00:27:22,892
- Our Miriam?
- Yes.

705
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,226
I don't understand.

706
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:30,941
About a month ago,
Joel came here

707
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:34,570
and he asked to come back.

708
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:36,655
She said no.

709
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:40,993
- She said no.
- She said no.

710
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:47,041
And you didn't tell me.

711
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:49,085
I didn't know how.

712
00:27:49,126 --> 00:27:51,087
And she didn't tell me.

713
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:53,381
She probably didn't know how.

714
00:27:55,424 --> 00:27:57,718
Well, thank you very much.

715
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:03,349
Drina! I need the ball.

716
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:04,975
And the cards.

717
00:28:05,017 --> 00:28:07,478
I need the ball and the cards
and two cups of tea.

718
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,398
- Hello.
- Drina?

719
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:14,693
Welcome.
Please, have a seat.

720
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:15,945
Who are you?

721
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:17,988
I am Madame Cosma.

722
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,990
I see your future
so you don't have to.

723
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,076
N-No. What happened to Drina?

724
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:24,787
Drina, she's home now.

725
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:26,956
Drina went back to the old
country without telling me?

726
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:29,458
The old country,
she's from the Bronx.

727
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,751
Oh, no, no, no.
Drina's from Eastern Europe.

728
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:33,254
A small city
just outside Bucharest.

729
00:28:33,295 --> 00:28:35,297
Okay.

730
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:36,966
I need to see her.
She tells my fortune.

731
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:39,176
She reads my tea leaves.
She helps guide my life.

732
00:28:39,218 --> 00:28:41,637
Well, now I am the person
who's gonna do that,

733
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,180
but between you and me,

734
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:45,850
the tea leaf thing,
kind of a scam.

735
00:28:45,891 --> 00:28:49,228
Pyromancy. Gazing into fire...

736
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:51,647
Much more accurate,
prettier, too.

737
00:28:51,689 --> 00:28:54,692
- This isn't happening.
- The price is the same.

738
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,570
And if you pay in advance,
your tenth visit is free.

739
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:59,196
Plus, I throw in a charm.

740
00:28:59,238 --> 00:29:01,699
I don't believe this.
What am I gonna do?

741
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:05,870
I don't even have to consult
the cards to see...

742
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:09,498
that it's all going wrong
for you.

743
00:29:29,477 --> 00:29:31,020
Hello, Abe.

744
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:35,941
Abe. Abe!

745
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:39,153
I just need a moment, please.

746
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:41,155
Okay, I know you hate me.

747
00:29:41,197 --> 00:29:42,698
I don't blame you.

748
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,825
I'm not feeling too hot
about myself, either.

749
00:29:44,867 --> 00:29:47,828
I just wanted to talk to you
about what my father said

750
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:51,373
at that dinner
a couple months ago.

751
00:29:51,415 --> 00:29:53,083
For Professor Weissman?

752
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:55,503
I'll take it.

753
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:57,796
Abe, you got a package.

754
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:05,971
Okay, then I'll talk
to your door.

755
00:30:06,013 --> 00:30:08,057
It's true what he said.

756
00:30:08,098 --> 00:30:10,059
Miriam and I were broke.

757
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,435
I mean, flat broke.

758
00:30:11,477 --> 00:30:12,811
We were spending
more than we made,

759
00:30:12,853 --> 00:30:14,730
couldn't save anything.

760
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:17,191
But she had no idea
that that was the case.

761
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:20,194
She'd ask about money and I'd
say we're fine, we're good.

762
00:30:20,236 --> 00:30:22,738
She trusted me.

763
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:25,533
She's always trusted me.

764
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:28,035
There's a lot of things
I can't make right again,

765
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:30,496
but there's some things I can.

766
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:36,835
Thanks.

767
00:30:38,295 --> 00:30:40,381
Table.

768
00:30:42,049 --> 00:30:44,426
I've been stepping up
at work, Abe.

769
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:46,929
And I'm in line for a new job.

770
00:30:46,971 --> 00:30:48,556
It's a pretty big promotion.

771
00:30:48,597 --> 00:30:51,392
Well, good for you.

772
00:30:51,433 --> 00:30:54,353
I'm not bragging,
it just means...

773
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:57,064
Look.

774
00:30:57,106 --> 00:31:00,526
It comes with a raise,
a pretty big one.

775
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:02,528
And I've been
crunching the numbers.

776
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:04,280
Uh-huh.

777
00:31:04,321 --> 00:31:06,657
Miriam and the kids can't live
at your place forever.

778
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:09,577
They're gonna need their own
place, three bedrooms at least.

779
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:11,161
I can swing that now.

780
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,788
And she wants the kids
to go to private school?

781
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,206
Yes, she does.

782
00:31:14,248 --> 00:31:16,166
Ethan to Collegiate
and Esther to Brearley.

783
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:19,211
Tuition's about $1,100 each,
and I budgeted for that, too.

784
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:21,880
Then there's clothes,
entertainment.

785
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:23,716
I want them to go
to shows and movies,

786
00:31:23,757 --> 00:31:26,302
take piano lessons,
go on vacations.

787
00:31:26,343 --> 00:31:27,720
It's all here.

788
00:31:27,761 --> 00:31:29,722
Everything they need
is accounted for.

789
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:31,849
And my new salary
will cover it all.

790
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,727
And if you don't get
the new job?

791
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:37,271
Then I'll go back
to working for my father.

792
00:31:37,313 --> 00:31:39,857
Either way, that is the salary.

793
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:43,861
Joel, you know that I am
pretty good at math.

794
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,654
- Right?
- Yes.

795
00:31:45,696 --> 00:31:48,032
There's nothing left for you.

796
00:31:48,073 --> 00:31:49,825
I'll be fine.

797
00:31:49,867 --> 00:31:52,119
- You'll be fine?
- The new job takes me

798
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:53,495
to the West Coast a lot,

799
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:54,788
eventually,
I'll be moving there.

800
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:56,040
To California?

801
00:31:56,081 --> 00:31:57,416
Miriam said you hate California.

802
00:31:57,458 --> 00:31:59,293
Doesn't matter.

803
00:31:59,335 --> 00:32:01,795
But what about the kids?

804
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:04,131
They're taken care of.
Anything they want.

805
00:32:04,173 --> 00:32:05,924
But you won't see them.

806
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:08,594
They don't need me.

807
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:13,015
Joel.

808
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:15,267
So do me a favor, Abe?

809
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:17,269
Be the go-between on this.

810
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:19,355
Tell Midge that she
and the kids are all set.

811
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:23,025
You'll do that?

812
00:32:23,067 --> 00:32:25,277
I'll do that.

813
00:32:26,779 --> 00:32:29,281
This is good, Abe.

814
00:32:29,323 --> 00:32:31,075
You should be happy.

815
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,535
Okay.

816
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:36,246
I'll be happy.

817
00:32:56,725 --> 00:32:58,185
Good afternoon.

818
00:32:58,227 --> 00:32:59,603
Miss Gleason, I presume.

819
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:01,647
Yes. Good afternoon.

820
00:33:01,689 --> 00:33:02,940
Miss Lennon is expecting you.

821
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,441
Please come in.

822
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:06,985
Thank you.

823
00:33:10,406 --> 00:33:13,200
So who composed that doorbell?
Puccini?

824
00:33:13,242 --> 00:33:14,660
I wouldn't know.

825
00:33:14,702 --> 00:33:17,538
Probably just some guy
at the doorbell factory.

826
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:19,456
Your coat, miss?

827
00:33:19,498 --> 00:33:21,458
Oh, yes.

828
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:24,044
Wow. Such a big foyer.

829
00:33:24,086 --> 00:33:25,754
You should put in
a ping-pong table.

830
00:33:25,796 --> 00:33:27,965
- Jenkins?
- Oh.

831
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:31,009
- Oh, hi, Jenkins.
- The lady's coat.

832
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:42,020
They look like
they could use some water.

833
00:33:42,062 --> 00:33:44,022
Miss Lennon
will be down shortly.

834
00:33:44,064 --> 00:33:46,608
Miss Lennon is down now.

835
00:33:50,529 --> 00:33:52,906
Sophie. Hi.

836
00:33:52,948 --> 00:33:54,867
So good to see you.

837
00:33:54,908 --> 00:33:56,785
Oh, and you're on time.

838
00:33:56,827 --> 00:33:58,620
That's so unlike a comic.

839
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:00,372
- I tend to be punctual.
- Mmm.

840
00:34:00,414 --> 00:34:03,459
The lady was inquiring as to the
provenance of the doorbell.

841
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,419
It was a joke.
I said Puccini.

842
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:06,837
It was Aaron Copland.

843
00:34:06,879 --> 00:34:08,922
Wait. Aaron Copland
wrote your doorbell?

844
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:10,424
It's something he does.

845
00:34:10,466 --> 00:34:13,010
Aaron writes doorbells
for all his friends.

846
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:16,597
I guess even composers need to
let loose sometimes.

847
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:18,307
Dawes, how is the light
in the Blue Room today?

848
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:19,892
I got a terrible night's sleep,

849
00:34:19,933 --> 00:34:22,269
and you know that makes my eyes
sensitive to light.

850
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:24,730
Is the light caustic today?

851
00:34:24,772 --> 00:34:26,732
I'll check, ma'am.

852
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:42,331
The light is not caustic, ma'am.

853
00:34:42,372 --> 00:34:44,416
The Blue Room it is.

854
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:56,470
Wow. Wow.

855
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:59,056
I had to fire six designers
to get it here.

856
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,766
I'm not sure it was worth it.

857
00:35:00,808 --> 00:35:03,185
- This is gorgeous.
- Don't touch.

858
00:35:03,227 --> 00:35:04,895
That was Cole Porter's.

859
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:08,899
He wrote "Begin the Beguine"
on that very instrument.

860
00:35:08,941 --> 00:35:11,151
And this rug was once owned
by George Gershwin.

861
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:12,694
Should I walk on it?

862
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:15,739
Lightly. You'll have the
grand tour after we eat.

863
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:18,242
Terrific.
I'd love to see the kitchen.

864
00:35:18,283 --> 00:35:19,993
The kitchen? Really?

865
00:35:20,035 --> 00:35:21,537
Why?

866
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:23,288
Because I love kitchens.

867
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,499
Really? Kitchens?

868
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:27,084
Why?

869
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:30,087
- They're neat.
- To be honest,

870
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:32,548
I haven't been in our kitchen
in quite some time.

871
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:35,634
I'm on the road, I'm upstairs,

872
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:38,095
but if it means that much
to you, we'll find it.

873
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,264
Ready for tea, ma'am?

874
00:35:40,305 --> 00:35:42,432
Yes, Dawes.
Let's sit.

875
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:49,189
So the bread for the finger
sandwiches is from Provence.

876
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:51,400
Uh, the macaroons
are French, too.

877
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:55,404
Clotted cream is from London,
of course, and the scones.

878
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:57,823
I would never eat
a domestic scone.

879
00:35:57,865 --> 00:35:59,575
Shall we prepare your plate,
miss?

880
00:35:59,616 --> 00:36:01,243
Yes, thank you.

881
00:36:01,285 --> 00:36:04,454
And I will have my usual, Dawes.

882
00:36:04,496 --> 00:36:07,583
So... this is you.

883
00:36:07,624 --> 00:36:08,876
This is me.

884
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,919
- Surprised?
- A little.

885
00:36:10,961 --> 00:36:13,463
You were expecting
Sophie Lennon, weren't ya?

886
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:16,800
Yes. - It's a very
successful charade, isn't it?

887
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:19,928
- Amazing.
- It's all fat suit and makeup.

888
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,555
How do people not know?

889
00:36:21,597 --> 00:36:24,182
I've never seen a picture of you
out of character.

890
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:26,143
I pay the publicists,
I pay the rags.

891
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:29,062
I paid for Walter Winchell's
summer home, for Christ's sake.

892
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,647
Fans don't want to see this.

893
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:33,150
They want the hausfrau
from Queens.

894
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:35,777
Ooh. Macaroons.

895
00:36:35,819 --> 00:36:39,197
You are so refreshing.

896
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:41,742
- Hmm?
- Eating a macaroon like that.

897
00:36:41,783 --> 00:36:43,410
Oh, am I eating it wrong?

898
00:36:43,452 --> 00:36:45,579
No, no, no.
You're eating it.

899
00:36:47,247 --> 00:36:49,541
Leave the wedge, please.

900
00:37:02,554 --> 00:37:05,098
My goodness, you're so pretty.

901
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,893
Why comedy? Can't you sing?

902
00:37:07,935 --> 00:37:11,188
Nope. The comedy thing...
I-I just fell into it.

903
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:12,689
Mm, me, too.

904
00:37:12,731 --> 00:37:14,733
- I went to Yale Drama School.
- You're kidding.

905
00:37:14,775 --> 00:37:17,194
Yes, I wanted
to be the next Laurette Taylor.

906
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:19,237
Then I graduated, and I starved,

907
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:22,741
so I started doing this
character... Sophie from Queens.

908
00:37:22,783 --> 00:37:24,743
And look what it paid for.

909
00:37:24,785 --> 00:37:26,203
Dawes?

910
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:29,206
- Yes, ma'am?
- Isn't that marvelous?

911
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:32,709
- Uh...
- So tell me...

912
00:37:32,751 --> 00:37:35,128
what is your gimmick?

913
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,422
- My...?
- Your persona.

914
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:39,049
- Your Sophie.
- Oh.

915
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:41,593
I don't have a persona.
I'm just me.

916
00:37:41,635 --> 00:37:44,179
Oh, no, no, no,
that will not work.

917
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:46,515
- It won't?
- No. No one wants that.

918
00:37:46,556 --> 00:37:48,016
I-I've been doing okay.

919
00:37:48,058 --> 00:37:49,601
Downtown.

920
00:37:49,643 --> 00:37:51,853
Honey, you give a downtowner
a swig of gin,

921
00:37:51,895 --> 00:37:53,939
and he'll laugh at a sponge.

922
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:56,858
The mainstreamers,
the people from Pacoima,

923
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:00,445
the people who buy the dish soap
and the dog food,

924
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:05,367
who pay for the Modigliani's...
They want a character.

925
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:07,661
But... Bob Hope
doesn't have a character.

926
00:38:07,703 --> 00:38:09,496
Lenny Bruce doesn't have
a character.

927
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:12,290
They have dicks.
Do you have a dick?

928
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:14,084
Not last time I checked.

929
00:38:14,126 --> 00:38:16,461
Darling, look at you.

930
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:19,423
I mean, really...
Men don't want to laugh at you.

931
00:38:19,464 --> 00:38:20,966
They want to fuck you.

932
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:23,010
You can't go up there
and be a woman.

933
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:24,928
You've got to be a thing.

934
00:38:24,970 --> 00:38:26,471
You want to get ahead
in comedy?

935
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:28,640
Cover up that hole.

936
00:38:28,682 --> 00:38:30,851
Another macaroon, miss?

937
00:38:30,892 --> 00:38:32,436
No, thank you, Dawes.

938
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:34,896
You're learning.

939
00:38:36,398 --> 00:38:39,985
So... you got the grand tour?

940
00:38:40,027 --> 00:38:41,862
My feet hurt, we walked so much.

941
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,613
I love that you love kitchens.

942
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:45,282
- I do.
- Mm.

943
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:47,409
You should visit yours sometime.
It misses you.

944
00:38:47,451 --> 00:38:49,286
Oh, and you have macaroons
to take home.

945
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,704
This was very nice.

946
00:38:50,746 --> 00:38:52,706
- Mm.
- Thank you, Sophie.

947
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:54,750
I have a feeling
we're going to be seeing a lot

948
00:38:54,791 --> 00:38:56,168
of each other in the future.

949
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:57,711
I hope so.

950
00:38:57,753 --> 00:38:59,671
Well, good luck tomorrow night.

951
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:01,882
Say hello to Harry
and make him laugh.

952
00:39:01,923 --> 00:39:03,550
- I will do my best.
- Mm.

953
00:39:03,592 --> 00:39:05,052
Your coat, miss.

954
00:39:05,093 --> 00:39:06,970
What is that?

955
00:39:07,012 --> 00:39:08,597
That is my coat.

956
00:39:08,638 --> 00:39:10,932
That flimsy thing?
It's freezing out.

957
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:14,186
Uh-uh. Jenkins?

958
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:17,731
A fat suit is very warm,
by the way.

959
00:39:21,902 --> 00:39:24,696
This was really not necessary.

960
00:39:24,738 --> 00:39:27,157
Miss Lennon was unhappy
with your coat.

961
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,408
How should I get it back to her?

962
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:30,327
She's worn it twice.
It's yours now.

963
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:31,995
Do you need a car?

964
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:34,247
No. Thank you, Dawes.

965
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:36,333
This has been a gas.

966
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,960
It has, miss. Good-bye.

967
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:09,241
- Goot Shabbos, Abraham.
- Goot Shabbos, Chaim.

968
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:10,784
Where are the ladies?

969
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:12,744
A very good question, Chaim.

970
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:16,998
Abraham...

971
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,584
come close, please!

972
00:40:21,253 --> 00:40:23,630
The rabbi has a cold.

973
00:40:26,007 --> 00:40:28,426
Thank you, Chaim.

974
00:40:38,645 --> 00:40:42,399

Long story.

Don't "shh" me!
Don't you ever "shh" me!

Tell me where you got the fur coat!
Rose.

00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:37,954
- Mama!
- What? Marshall Field?

That's in Chicago.

- When were you in Chicago?
- Shh!

998
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,251
- What about Marshall Field?
- Not now, Chaim.

999
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:44,753
Why do you have a fur coat?

1000
00:41:44,794 --> 00:41:46,171
Really, we are ruining
"Lecha Dodi."

1001
00:41:46,213 --> 00:41:47,756
Well, I think I deserve

1002
00:41:47,797 --> 00:41:49,716
to know some fucking thing,
don't I, Miriam?

1003
00:41:49,758 --> 00:41:52,135
I mean, don't I deserve
to know anything?

1004
00:41:52,177 --> 00:41:53,887
Rose, look where we are.

1005
00:41:53,929 --> 00:41:56,139
I mean, I clearly, didn't
deserve to know that Abe knew

1006
00:41:56,181 --> 00:41:57,599
that your husband
came back, right?

1007
00:41:57,641 --> 00:41:59,434
I clearly didn't deserve
to know that the thing

1008
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:01,144
I'd been waiting for
all these months,

1009

the reconciliation
of Ethan's mother and father...

1010
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,941
I-I-I, what, didn't deserve
to know that that happened.

1011
00:42:05,982 --> 00:42:08,485
Okay, fine! I get that!
That's life, but the least

1012
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,111
you can do, Miriam, is tell me

1013
00:42:10,153 --> 00:42:11,738

kicks in.

1021
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:54,072
Appreciated. You know, there's
a lot of energy in this room.

1022

It's impressive.

1023
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:57,450

away out there.

00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,536
Thanks for this, Harry.
Really.

1025
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:02,289
- I'm gonna go check on my girl.
- Go. Be a manager.

1026
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,332
Hey, Jerry.

1027
00:43:04,374 --> 00:43:06,084
- Where's Midge?
- She's in the men's.

1028
00:43:06,126 --> 00:43:08,545
What is she doing in the men's?

1029
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:13,258
- Occupied!
- It's me!

1030
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,676
Come on in.

1031
00:43:14,718 --> 00:43:16,553
What are you doing
in the men's room?

1032
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,305
Getting ready.
The women's room was disgusting.

1033
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:20,140
Jackie, how disgusting
is the women's room

1034
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:21,850
that the men's room
is less disgusting?

1035
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:23,935
I don't know.
I don't go in the women's room.

1036
00:43:23,977 --> 00:43:25,562
Must be foul, though.

1037
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:27,856
You ready?
Crowd is clamoring.

1038
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:30,317
I am ready.

1039
00:43:30,358 --> 00:43:32,360
So I was thinking
you should go back to starting

1040
00:43:32,402 --> 00:43:33,945
with the stuff
about your parents first.

1041
00:43:33,987 --> 00:43:35,572
Then go to your work stuff...
like you used to.

1042
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,574
- I was thinking the same thing.
- Mm. Simpatico.

1043
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,159
So simpatico.

1044
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,910
Jackie, do your thing.

1045
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:43,496
Okay, I'm going back with Harry.
Break a leg.

1046
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:45,123
You ready, Amanda?

1047
00:43:45,165 --> 00:43:47,375
Amanda is ready.

1048
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:51,838
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1049
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:54,341
Don't applaud me. I'm nobody.

1050
00:43:54,382 --> 00:43:56,092
Applaud the young lady
coming up.

1051
00:43:56,134 --> 00:43:57,927
She has been killing it
these past few weeks

1052
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,888
right here at the Gaslight.

1053
00:43:59,929 --> 00:44:02,891
And tonight, you are witnessing
a very special showcase.

1054
00:44:02,932 --> 00:44:06,853
So give it up for our own
HOMEGROWN GIRL: Amanda Gleason!

1055
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:11,649
Okay, okay.

1056
00:44:11,691 --> 00:44:13,818
Guess the checks I wrote
to all of you have cleared.

1057
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,278
Good to know.

1058
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,989
Stop it. Stop it.

1059
00:44:18,031 --> 00:44:19,699
Oh, stop.

1060
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:22,619
- She glows, this girl.
- That she does.

1061
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:25,455
You ever think
about your parents having sex?

1062
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:29,751
Yeah. Yeah, even Freud is like,

1063
00:44:29,793 --> 00:44:31,628
"You know what?
I'm gonna pass on that one."

1064
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:33,588
But I was at my parents' house

1065
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:37,425
one morning recently,
and I heard this sound.

1066
00:44:46,810 --> 00:44:48,853
This scraping noise.

1067
00:44:48,895 --> 00:44:52,148
So I went into their bedroom,
and there were my parents,

1068
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:55,318
struggling
to separate the twin beds.

1069
00:45:02,534 --> 00:45:05,286
You know, I'm gonna give my
parents' sex life a night off.

1070
00:45:05,328 --> 00:45:08,415
I'm gonna give my mother
a night off... from me,

1071
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:10,208
from my mind.

1072
00:45:10,250 --> 00:45:12,085
Wouldn't that be nice?
What do you say?

1073
00:45:12,127 --> 00:45:15,088
Yeah, what do you think?

1074
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:18,800
No. I-I... I love my mother,
I really do.

1075
00:45:18,842 --> 00:45:22,554
I just, I wish that sometimes
she would just... relax,

1076
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:24,681
not worry about things.

1077
00:45:24,722 --> 00:45:26,182
I-I mean, it's not her fault.

1078
00:45:26,224 --> 00:45:28,726
She just wants everything
to be perfect.

1079
00:45:28,768 --> 00:45:32,397
No, no, she wants everything
to seem perfect,

1080
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:34,941
to look perfect.

1081
00:45:34,983 --> 00:45:38,611
She's like a Jewish Dorian Gray.

1082
00:45:38,653 --> 00:45:42,490
She's so focused on me,

1083
00:45:42,532 --> 00:45:45,452
and I don't understand it,
because so what if I work?

1084
00:45:45,493 --> 00:45:47,912
So what if I get divorced?

1085
00:45:47,954 --> 00:45:49,914
So what if I'm alone?

1086
00:45:49,956 --> 00:45:55,003
Why do women care about how
people look at them or see them?

1087
00:45:55,044 --> 00:45:56,754
All women.

1088
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:59,215
Beautiful women,
successful women.

1089
00:45:59,257 --> 00:46:01,092
Yeah.

1090
00:46:01,134 --> 00:46:02,760
Do you know Sophie Lennon?

1091
00:46:02,802 --> 00:46:05,096
Sure.

1092
00:46:05,138 --> 00:46:06,639
Sure, yeah, everyone does.

1093
00:46:06,681 --> 00:46:09,726
Queen of vaudeville,
conquered radio.

1094
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,561
She is a comedy icon.

1095
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:13,229
But you know what?

1096
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:16,065
You don't know
the great Sophie Lennon.

1097
00:46:16,107 --> 00:46:17,609
This is part of her act?

1098
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,068
She's a little off book here.

1099
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,904
I got to go to her house.

1100
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:23,364
Sidebar... it's not in Queens!

1101
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:25,158
In fact,
calling that thing a house

1102
00:46:25,200 --> 00:46:27,035
is like calling
the Vatican a church.

1103
00:46:29,037 --> 00:46:31,915
I mean, this woman drips wealth,
you know?

1104
00:46:31,956 --> 00:46:34,000
Like, if she had been around
during the Russian Revolution,

1105
00:46:34,042 --> 00:46:37,170
the Bolsheviks would've told
the Romanovs, "Ah, never mind.

1106
00:46:37,212 --> 00:46:38,630
"Take your diamonds,
take your crowns.

1107
00:46:38,671 --> 00:46:40,340
We got Sophie Lennon.
That'll do us."

1108
00:46:40,381 --> 00:46:43,134
And her poor staff.

1109
00:46:43,176 --> 00:46:45,553
I have a feeling
that when company leaves,

1110
00:46:45,595 --> 00:46:48,264
that's when her butlers
and maids do their real jobs...

1111
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:50,433
Polishing her silver
and her ego.

1112
00:46:51,935 --> 00:46:55,271
- What the fuck?
- Fat Sophie Lennon.

1113
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:57,690
Right?
"Put that on your plate!"

1114
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,737
Well, guess what?
It's a fucking fat suit.

1115
00:47:02,779 --> 00:47:04,531
What?

1116
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:06,658
And there is nothing
on her plate.

1117
00:47:06,699 --> 00:47:08,201
I ate with her.

1118
00:47:08,243 --> 00:47:10,411
All she did was suck a lemon
down to the rind,

1119
00:47:10,453 --> 00:47:13,706
and when I had the audacity
to take a bite of a cookie,

1120
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:15,792
she made me feel like
I'd splashed her

1121
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,210
with a cup of syphilis.

1122
00:47:19,671 --> 00:47:21,839
You know, she gave me
a piece of advice

1123
00:47:21,881 --> 00:47:24,467
right there in the Blue Room.

1124
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:28,096
She told me
that no one would find me funny

1125
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:31,516
unless I do some big,
whackadoodle character,

1126
00:47:31,558 --> 00:47:33,184
or have a dick.

1127
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:35,311
"Sophie Lennon!"

1128
00:47:35,353 --> 00:47:39,315
Really? You're gonna sit in
your million-dollar townhouse,

1129
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:41,359
on some chair that's historical

1130
00:47:41,401 --> 00:47:43,403
because the Mad King George
got the trots on it,

1131
00:47:43,444 --> 00:47:45,488
and tell me
that men won't think I'm funny

1132
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:47,699
because I don't look like
a dump truck?

1133
00:47:49,617 --> 00:47:52,328
Why do women have to pretend to
be something that they're not?

1134
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,122
Right.

1135
00:47:54,163 --> 00:47:57,000
Why do we have to pretend to be
stupid when we're not stupid?

1136
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:59,085
- Yeah!
- Why do we have to pretend

1137
00:47:59,127 --> 00:48:02,380
to be helpless when we're not helpless?

1138
00:48:02,422 --> 00:48:04,549
Why do we have
to pretend to be sorry

1139
00:48:04,591 --> 00:48:06,593
when we have nothing
to be sorry about?

1140
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:08,469
Amen! Right!

1141
00:48:08,511 --> 00:48:11,556
Why do we have to pretend we're
not hungry when we're hungry?

1142
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:16,686
Fuck you, Sophie!
Put that on your plate!

1143
00:48:19,147 --> 00:48:22,233
Harry, wait.

1144
00:48:22,275 --> 00:48:24,611
- Harry!
- Let them not eat cake.

1145
00:48:24,652 --> 00:48:26,571
Please.

1146
00:48:26,613 --> 00:48:28,323
Harry, wait. Let me explain.

1147
00:48:28,364 --> 00:48:30,158
You're dead in this business.
You hear me?

1148
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:32,327
You double-cross me,
you don't come back.

1149
00:48:32,368 --> 00:48:34,245
I told you
she was spontaneous.

1150
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:36,748
Do you have any idea what
it means to be on my bad side?

1151
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:38,958
I don't want to be on your bad side.
This town

1152
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,877
is gonna become
a very uncomfortable place

1153
00:48:40,918 --> 00:48:42,295
for you two, Susie.

1154
00:48:42,337 --> 00:48:44,339
Fucking count on it.

1155
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:46,799
...Sophie and my mother.

1156
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:49,636
Now there's a pair.

1157
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:51,512
Let's get those two together.

1158
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:54,682
Maybe my mother will move into
Sophie's unoccupied kitchen

1159
00:48:54,724 --> 00:48:58,061
and together they can eat
lemon wedges for eternity!

1160
00:48:59,854 --> 00:49:04,442
As long as the lemons are
the best lemons in the world.

1161
00:49:04,484 --> 00:49:06,903
Oh, I'm just
getting started here.

1162
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:09,614
You don't have anywhere to go,
