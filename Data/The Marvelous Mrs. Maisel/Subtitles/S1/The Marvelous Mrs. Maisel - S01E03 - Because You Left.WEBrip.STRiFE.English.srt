- See you.

180
00:06:20,515 --> 00:06:21,820
- Figures.
- What?

181
00:06:21,898 --> 00:06:23,878
You get arrested, you get
bailed out by Lenny Bruce.

182
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:25,463
If I got arrested, I'd be bailed out

183
00:06:25,505 --> 00:06:28,216
by whatever Village tinker bell
has blow job money

184
00:06:28,257 --> 00:06:29,789
left over from the night before.

185
00:06:31,344 --> 00:06:32,929
ROSE: She said nothing.

186
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:35,139
She just waltzed in,
scooped up the kids,

187
00:06:35,181 --> 00:06:36,933
yelled "thanks" and left.

188
00:06:36,974 --> 00:06:38,059
No explanation.

189
00:06:38,101 --> 00:06:39,644
It was 1:15 in the morning.

190
00:06:39,685 --> 00:06:41,270
And it was cold last night.

191
00:06:41,312 --> 00:06:42,647
What does that have to do with anything?

192
00:06:42,688 --> 00:06:44,232
Nothing, I'm just saying it was cold.

193
00:06:44,273 --> 00:06:45,358
Where's the coffee?

194
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:46,776
Why is there no coffee?

195
00:06:46,818 --> 00:06:49,054
Her hair was still wet,
like she just showered.

196
00:06:49,257 --> 00:06:50,613
Who showers at that hour?

197
00:06:50,655 --> 00:06:52,615
Where's Zelda?
Zelda's in charge of coffee.

198
00:06:52,657 --> 00:06:54,992
She's acting so strange and different.

199
00:06:55,109 --> 00:06:57,703
- ABE: Why?
- Why? Her marriage, Abe.

200
00:06:58,062 --> 00:06:59,631
When did Zelda get married?

201
00:06:59,656 --> 00:07:01,857
- Not Zelda, your daughter.
- Oh, her.

202
00:07:01,882 --> 00:07:04,101
Yes, her. I know it's a horrible time,

203
00:07:04,126 --> 00:07:05,445
but I don't know
what's going on with her.

204
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:08,023
I don't know what she's doing
or where she's going.

205
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:10,945
Yesterday, after that blow-up
at dinner, she just left.

206
00:07:11,143 --> 00:07:12,742
And she had a place to go.

207
00:07:13,231 --> 00:07:15,025
If I got mad at you at 10:00 at night,

208
00:07:15,050 --> 00:07:17,304
and I walked out that door,
I would not have a place to go.

209
00:07:17,329 --> 00:07:18,414
I'd be standing
outside the door thinking,

210
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:19,570
"I don't have a place to go."

211
00:07:19,595 --> 00:07:21,681
She walked out that door
and had a place to go.

212
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:25,734
And that call from this strange
person, this "Mrs. Miniver."

213
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,398
Mrs. Miniver? From the movie?

214
00:07:27,592 --> 00:07:29,421
Obviously it wasn't Mrs. Miniver, Abe.

215
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,039
Somebody stole my briefcase.

216
00:07:31,064 --> 00:07:33,441
Who is this person
that doesn't give me her name?

217
00:07:33,466 --> 00:07:35,843
That doesn't even seem to know
what she's calling about.

218
00:07:35,868 --> 00:07:37,828
She didn't even know the kids' names.

219
00:07:37,949 --> 00:07:39,734
I even heard her crying at one point.

220
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:41,554
I was trying to get more
information out of her

221
00:07:41,579 --> 00:07:43,609
and I realized she wasn't even
on the other end of the phone,

222
00:07:43,634 --> 00:07:45,703
she had gone somewhere,
I was talking to myself.

223
00:07:46,227 --> 00:07:48,396
- Abe, are you listening?
- Yes!

224
00:07:48,437 --> 00:07:49,615
Then acknowledge me.

225
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:51,357
Somebody really did steal my briefcase.

226
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,733
It's in the foyer.

227
00:07:53,156 --> 00:07:54,527
It shouldn't be there.

228
00:07:54,695 --> 00:07:56,779
This is not my relationship with Miriam.

229
00:07:56,821 --> 00:07:58,614
This is not how it's always been.

230
00:07:58,656 --> 00:08:00,616
I used to know all her friends.

231
00:08:00,658 --> 00:08:02,243
I used to know what she did.

232
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,039
I used to know her mind.

233
00:08:04,304 --> 00:08:05,848
Now I know nothing.

234
00:08:05,873 --> 00:08:07,187
It was in the foyer.

235
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,812
I'm very concerned about her.

236
00:08:15,679 --> 00:08:17,328
I have that thing tonight.

00:08:40,157 --> 00:08:42,748
I wake up and he's just
standing there, staring at me.

00:08:42,773 --> 00:08:44,994
- IMOGENE: Spooky.
- MIDGE: He's never done this.

242
00:08:45,036 --> 00:08:47,031
Well, it's pretty obvious
what this is about.

243
00:08:47,148 --> 00:08:49,498
- It is?
- The man whose name we do not speak.

244
00:08:49,617 --> 00:08:50,779
You mean Joel?

245
00:08:50,804 --> 00:08:52,043
I thought we weren't speaking his name.

246
00:08:52,084 --> 00:08:54,545
He's living with you, Imogene,
how can you not speak his name?

247
00:08:54,587 --> 00:08:56,234
I'm just trying to be sensitive.

248
00:08:56,259 --> 00:08:57,553
I don't think that's it.

249
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:58,633
I mean, Ethan's so young,

250
00:08:58,674 --> 00:09:01,135
and Joel was usually off
to work before he was even up.

251
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:04,305
Oh, no, Ethan knows,
because kids know everything.

- They know.
- Maybe.

- Well, what does Dr. Spock say?
- I don't know.

- Have you not consulted your Dr. Spock?
- No.

257

- But you have Dr. Spock.
- I think so.

258
00:09:17,068 --> 00:09:18,653
Midge, have you not read Dr. Spock?

259
00:09:18,694 --> 00:09:20,382
- I've skimmed it.
- Skimmed it?

260
00:09:20,546 --> 00:09:22,764
Midge, you don't skim Dr. Spock,

261
00:09:22,789 --> 00:09:26,568
you absorb Dr. Spock,
you inhale Dr. Spock.

I mean, how are your children even alive

- and you have not read Dr. Spock?

Oh, shoot, I'm talking about Archie.

- So?
- He's my husband.

Yes, I know, I know Archie.

271
00:09:43,177 --> 00:09:44,428

- I'm not getting upset.
- You're mad at me

- that we took him in.
- I'm not mad at you,

- it's not your fault.
- How could it possibly be my fault?

- It's not.

No, he's not.

You said he was in love
with her, but maybe he's not.

Maybe you should give him a call.

what I thought should happen

325
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:21,202

00:12:24,004 --> 00:12:25,423
Smells like mildew.

351
00:12:25,464 --> 00:12:27,675
Well, that could be me.
What's with the duds?

352
00:12:27,716 --> 00:12:29,510
You got a shoot
with Harper's Bazaar later?

353
00:12:29,552 --> 00:12:31,804
I always dress nicely
for important meetings.

354
00:12:31,846 --> 00:12:33,639
When Joel and I met our co-op
board for the first time,

355
00:12:33,681 --> 00:12:34,932
I made the mistake
of wearing pedal pushers

356
00:12:34,974 --> 00:12:37,056
and they made us come back three times.

357
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:38,432
Is that a sandwich?

358
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:39,770
It used to be.

359
00:12:39,812 --> 00:12:41,024
Here, come. Sit.

360
00:12:41,049 --> 00:12:44,275
No, no, listen, Lizanne,
Terminiello v. Chicago.

361
00:12:44,571 --> 00:12:46,944
Douglas says the function of free speech

362
00:12:46,986 --> 00:12:48,779
is to invite dispute!

363
00:12:49,306 --> 00:12:51,574
Yeah, that's fucking poetry, goddamn it.

364
00:12:51,615 --> 00:12:53,282
I say so, too. I'll call you later.

365
00:12:53,868 --> 00:12:54,977
You're my 11:00?

366
00:12:55,002 --> 00:12:56,788
- MIDGE: Yes, sir.
- Susie, right?

367
00:12:56,813 --> 00:12:59,039
Yeah, and this is Miriam Maisel,
Michael Kessler.

368
00:12:59,081 --> 00:13:00,485
You going somewhere after this?

369
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:01,834
Country club? White House?

370
00:13:01,876 --> 00:13:03,102
I dressed for the meeting.

371
00:13:03,127 --> 00:13:04,587
You dressed for the meeting. (SNORTS)

372
00:13:04,628 --> 00:13:05,868
(LAUGHING): She dressed for the meeting.

373
00:13:05,893 --> 00:13:07,798
I dress for important meetings.

374
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,091
Well, you've come to the wrong place.

375
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,093
You like that?

376
00:13:11,641 --> 00:13:12,720
Kirk Douglas gave me that.

377
00:13:12,761 --> 00:13:14,585
He used it when he played
Van Gogh in that movie.

378
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:16,765
Really? W-Wow. I-I love Kirk Douglas.

379
00:13:16,807 --> 00:13:18,642
I worked pro bono for his pal, Trumbo,

380
00:13:18,684 --> 00:13:20,311
when he refused to name
names to Congress.

381
00:13:20,352 --> 00:13:21,395
You worked on that?

382
00:13:21,437 --> 00:13:22,563
Oh, Michael here has defended them all.

383
00:13:22,605 --> 00:13:23,814
Mainly constitutional things.

384
00:13:23,856 --> 00:13:25,212
Yeah, Jim Crow, he's on it.

385
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:27,516
- Voting rights, he's on it.
- What's happening with voting?

386
00:13:27,602 --> 00:13:30,070
Besides states keeping Negroes
from the polls, you mean?

387
00:13:30,112 --> 00:13:32,406
Yeah, Ethel and Julius
Rosenberg, he was on their team.

388
00:13:32,448 --> 00:13:33,657
Took four zaps in the chair

389
00:13:33,699 --> 00:13:34,813
to kill poor Ethel.

390
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,911
There was smoke coming out of her ears.

391
00:13:36,952 --> 00:13:38,579
Ah, Jewish women are known
to be more difficult.

392
00:13:38,621 --> 00:13:40,331
This is really fascinating.

393
00:13:40,372 --> 00:13:42,124
I'm-I'm gonna read up on all
this stuff when I get home.

394
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:43,626
You mean right after your cotillion?

395
00:13:43,667 --> 00:13:44,793
- My what?
- (SNORTS)

396
00:13:44,835 --> 00:13:46,504
(LAUGHS) I'm just joking.

397
00:13:46,545 --> 00:13:48,005
You are dressed very fancy.

398
00:13:48,047 --> 00:13:49,632
All right, let's see what we got here.

399
00:13:50,337 --> 00:13:53,052
"Performing without
a cabaret license." Bullshit.

400
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:54,595
"Public indecency."

401
00:13:54,637 --> 00:13:56,222
You said stuff to make a nun blush,

402
00:13:56,263 --> 00:13:57,848
but you didn't say it
in a convent, I'm assuming.

403
00:13:57,890 --> 00:13:59,183
I was not in a convent.

404
00:13:59,225 --> 00:14:00,935
- So, where's the crime?
- Right.

405
00:14:00,976 --> 00:14:03,759
Wow. "Simulating a sex act
while on stage."

406
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,481
"Sex act"? What?
That's-that's ridiculous.

407
00:14:05,523 --> 00:14:06,618
Yeah, I would've remembered that.

408
00:14:06,643 --> 00:14:08,526
Says something here about miming a whore

409
00:14:08,567 --> 00:14:09,798
tickling a man's testicles.

410
00:14:09,837 --> 00:14:11,195
- Oh, I did do that.
- Oh, yeah, she did.

411
00:14:11,237 --> 00:14:12,613
It was fucking funny.

412
00:14:12,655 --> 00:14:14,281
And apparently,
you exposed your breasts.

413
00:14:14,323 --> 00:14:15,533
I do not remember that.

414
00:14:15,574 --> 00:14:17,493
I do, and I got to tell you, Mike,

415
00:14:17,535 --> 00:14:19,119
when she whipped those
things out, I ducked.

416
00:14:19,161 --> 00:14:20,704
I'm telling you, boy, they were glowing.

417
00:14:20,746 --> 00:14:22,998
It was like a Mack truck
was coming at me. It killed.

418
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,792
- We will fight it all.
- MIDGE: Good.

419
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:25,918
I would like to be found innocent.

420
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,141
I would like that, too.

421
00:14:27,204 --> 00:14:28,963
Cops that hang out around outside clubs

422
00:14:29,004 --> 00:14:30,381
waiting to harass entertainers

423
00:14:30,422 --> 00:14:32,424
for doing their thing, I hate that.

424
00:14:32,466 --> 00:14:33,665
Passionately.

425
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,219
You start controlling speech,

426
00:14:35,261 --> 00:14:36,845
you're slip-sliding toward fascism,

427
00:14:36,887 --> 00:14:38,118
and we saw how that turned out.

428
00:14:38,143 --> 00:14:39,431
MIDGE: Great. You're hired.

429
00:14:39,473 --> 00:14:41,100
It's kind of up to him.

430
00:14:41,141 --> 00:14:44,144
The meeting is more to get him to do it.

431
00:14:44,186 --> 00:14:45,860
Oh. Will you do it?

432
00:14:46,391 --> 00:14:47,477
For nothing?

433
00:14:48,266 --> 00:14:49,900
If you had just dressed for the meeting.

434
00:14:49,942 --> 00:14:50,943
- (TELEPHONE RINGING)
- Thank you.

435
00:14:50,985 --> 00:14:52,313
Thank you, Mr. Kessler.

436
00:14:53,032 --> 00:14:54,243
Kessler.

437
00:14:54,595 --> 00:14:56,649
Yeah, Tom, I told you
to call me yesterday.

438
00:14:56,949 --> 00:14:58,701
No, this is not about the Rikers thing.

439
00:14:58,742 --> 00:15:00,570
This is about the Jersey thing.
Hang on, hang on.

440
00:15:00,595 --> 00:15:01,579
The outfit...

441
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,788
You will not see it again.

442
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:03,998
No, no, no. Wear it to court.

443
00:15:04,501 --> 00:15:06,079
It was an illegal search.

444
00:15:06,227 --> 00:15:07,543
How? They had no warrant

445
00:15:07,585 --> 00:15:09,253
and they busted his door in, that's how.

446
00:15:10,279 --> 00:15:11,587
Thank you, Jerry.

447
00:15:29,141 --> 00:15:30,251
Rose?

448
00:15:30,858 --> 00:15:31,977
Shh.

449
00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:34,618
(SIGHS)

450
00:15:37,724 --> 00:15:40,376
(QUIETLY): I want to work
on these signs with you.

451
00:15:50,561 --> 00:15:51,657
Rose?

452
00:15:52,446 --> 00:15:56,342
Rose... can I get you anything?

453
00:15:58,676 --> 00:15:59,828
No.

454
00:16:02,524 --> 00:16:03,556
Rose...

455
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:04,735
I just...

456
00:16:05,657 --> 00:16:08,118
I just have to let this pass.

457
00:16:10,261 --> 00:16:11,306
All right.

458
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,891
I'll be in my study.

459
00:16:15,352 --> 00:16:17,259
ROSE: Our daughter is in trouble,

460
00:16:19,046 --> 00:16:21,790
and you're not doing anything about it.

461
00:16:29,313 --> 00:16:31,710
So, it's my understanding, Mr. Kennedy,

462
00:16:31,752 --> 00:16:33,212
that your client is pleading guilty

463
00:16:33,253 --> 00:16:35,130
to drunk and disorderly conduct,

464
00:16:35,243 --> 00:16:37,925
including obstruction
of pedestrian traffic.

465
00:16:38,188 --> 00:16:39,635
Guy in the yellow shirt.

466
00:16:39,677 --> 00:16:41,095
- You ready?
- Yeah.

467
00:16:41,136 --> 00:16:43,389
One, two, three.

468
00:16:43,430 --> 00:16:44,821
- Rapist.
- Confidence trickster.

469
00:16:44,907 --> 00:16:46,087
Confidence trickster?

470
00:16:46,112 --> 00:16:47,476
Who are you, Charles Dickens?

471
00:16:47,618 --> 00:16:48,907
He is not a rapist.

472
00:16:49,144 --> 00:16:50,688
He looks pretty rapey to me.

473
00:16:51,196 --> 00:16:52,429
I'm going with con man.

474
00:16:52,454 --> 00:16:53,641
Or arsonist.

475
00:16:53,899 --> 00:16:55,524
You can't change your answer.

476
00:16:56,165 --> 00:16:58,153
All right, orange tie,
crappy suit. Ready?

477
00:16:58,195 --> 00:16:59,947
- Yeah.
- One, two, three.

478
00:16:59,988 --> 00:17:01,165
- Pickpocket.
- Horse fucker.

479
00:17:01,516 --> 00:17:03,325
I thought we were really playing.

480
00:17:03,367 --> 00:17:05,661
No, I'm telling you,
that guy has fucked a horse.

481
00:17:05,703 --> 00:17:08,038
Got the judge to drop
the cabaret license thing.

482
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,579
- Oh, great.
- Yes, thank you.

483
00:17:09,985 --> 00:17:12,918
He's in kind of a pissy mood,
so let me do the heavy lifting.

484
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,290
Gladly.

485
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,296
- (GAVEL BANGS)
- Next case.

486
00:17:16,338 --> 00:17:17,506
Docket number 4623.

487
00:17:17,548 --> 00:17:18,841
Miriam Maisel,

488
00:17:18,882 --> 00:17:21,037
charged with 1140A of the penal law.

489
00:17:21,062 --> 00:17:22,040
Tits up.

490
00:17:22,266 --> 00:17:24,346
Miriam Maisel, you are charged

491
00:17:24,388 --> 00:17:26,181
with 1140A of the penal law.

492
00:17:26,223 --> 00:17:28,392
While performing in a licensed venue,

493
00:17:28,434 --> 00:17:32,771
you presented and participated
in an obscene, indecent tableau.

494
00:17:34,626 --> 00:17:37,048
Uh, who is presiding as the prosecutor?

495
00:17:37,073 --> 00:17:39,153
Leon Cranmer, on behalf
of the People, Judge.

496
00:17:39,194 --> 00:17:40,751
Uh-huh, and for the defense?

497
00:17:40,776 --> 00:17:42,509
Good morning, Your Honor,
Michael Kessler.

498
00:17:42,534 --> 00:17:44,199
- And may I address the court?
- (SIGHS)

499
00:17:44,241 --> 00:17:46,118
- Yes, Mr. Kessler.
- Thank you, Your Honor.

500
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,663
Your Honor, Mrs. Maisel is
as she appears before you:

501
00:17:49,705 --> 00:17:52,446
an upstanding citizen
with a spotless record.

502
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:55,712
She is married with two
beautiful preschool children.

503
00:17:55,829 --> 00:17:57,379
She's a graduate of Bryn Mawr

504
00:17:57,421 --> 00:17:59,602
and is enormously respected
in her community.

505
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:00,758
A list of people

506
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,760
willing to vouch for her fine character

507
00:18:02,801 --> 00:18:04,181
would be as long as your arm.

508
00:18:04,206 --> 00:18:07,055
A list that would include
the venerable Rabbi Wasserman

509
00:18:07,097 --> 00:18:08,390
of Temple Shearith Israel.

510
00:18:08,432 --> 00:18:09,727
But most importantly,

511
00:18:09,752 --> 00:18:11,821
and I cannot stress
this strongly enough,

512
00:18:11,888 --> 00:18:14,766
there is no way
this activity would recur.

513
00:18:15,079 --> 00:18:17,274
This was a blip, an anomaly.

514
00:18:17,337 --> 00:18:19,235
It will never happen again.

515
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:20,652
But it already has.

516
00:18:20,694 --> 00:18:21,779
KESSLER: I'm sorry?

517
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,155
Isn't this her second arrest?

518
00:18:23,197 --> 00:18:24,698
Yes, but, Your Honor...

519
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:26,325
Regardless of that, Your Honor,
there's no denying

520
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:28,994
that Mrs. Maisel is
an honorable, respectable woman,

521
00:18:29,036 --> 00:18:31,163
and we are asking that
these charges be dismissed.

522
00:18:31,205 --> 00:18:32,414
JUDGE: Mm-hmm.

523
00:18:32,456 --> 00:18:34,024
Is your husband in the courtroom?

524
00:18:34,256 --> 00:18:35,329
Who, me?

525
00:18:35,834 --> 00:18:37,753
I don't believe Mr. Kessler
has a husband.

526
00:18:37,795 --> 00:18:39,254
Is your husband in the courtroom, ma'am?

527
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,438
- No.
- Well, I'm surprised by that.

528
00:18:42,598 --> 00:18:43,610
He's at work.

529
00:18:43,766 --> 00:18:46,040
Well, this is a serious matter,
little lady.

530
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:48,630
So I'm curious as to why
he didn't take the morning off

531
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,349
to help you deal with this.

532
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:53,602
Well, maybe he thought
I could handle it on my own.

533
00:18:53,644 --> 00:18:56,563
Yes, Mr. Maisel is a busy man,
and I see no reason

534
00:18:56,605 --> 00:18:58,860
to use up any more of your
valuable time, Your Honor.

535
00:18:58,885 --> 00:19:03,212
The language chronicled in
these incidents, ma'am... crude.

536
00:19:03,579 --> 00:19:04,863
- Lewd.
- Well, I...

537
00:19:04,905 --> 00:19:06,907
And also hearsay, Your Honor,

538
00:19:06,949 --> 00:19:09,618
reported by an obviously
overzealous police officer.

539
00:19:09,688 --> 00:19:11,454
Effectively, this was entrapment.

540
00:19:11,548 --> 00:19:12,788
Mr. Kessler, we don't need to hear

541
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:14,149
how much you hate the police.

542
00:19:14,306 --> 00:19:15,707
I don't hate the police, Your Honor,

543
00:19:15,749 --> 00:19:18,043
but I would like to point out
that no other witness

544
00:19:18,085 --> 00:19:20,454
has stepped forward to make
any sort of complaint.

545
00:19:20,479 --> 00:19:22,321
Mrs. Maisel, we all slip sometimes.

546
00:19:22,605 --> 00:19:23,860
Would you agree to that?

547
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,970
Yes, Your Honor.

548
00:19:25,995 --> 00:19:28,887
But the court does acknowledge
your standing in the community,

549
00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:30,973
your lack of prior arrests.

550
00:19:31,014 --> 00:19:33,516
- You're certainly packaged right.
- Thank you?

551
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,837
In many ways, it's our culture
that's slipping.

552
00:19:36,603 --> 00:19:38,821
Shirley Temple is a thing of the past.

553
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:40,607
- Too bad.
- Shirley Temple, Your Honor?

554
00:19:40,649 --> 00:19:42,618
Surely, Your Honor,
these are salient points.

555
00:19:42,643 --> 00:19:45,112
Now, I'll consider dismissal
after some assurance

556
00:19:45,153 --> 00:19:47,114
that you'll no longer engage in actions

557
00:19:47,155 --> 00:19:48,743
to the detriment of the moral health

558
00:19:48,768 --> 00:19:49,931

559
00:19:49,956 --> 00:19:52,709
- Moral health? Oh, come on.
- Excuse me.

560
00:19:52,734 --> 00:19:54,304
- Your Honor...
- Look, ev-everyone in that audience

561
00:19:54,329 --> 00:19:55,873

562
00:19:55,914 --> 00:19:57,583
- what the hell was going on, anyway.
- What was that?

563

It's a coffee house, it's just
coffee, there's no booze.

564
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,812
- Sit down, young man.
- Well, at least he said "young."

565

Your Honor, emotions are
running a little high here...

566
00:20:03,630 --> 00:20:05,924
And what exactly was wrong
with the words I said?

567

What's the crime there?

568
00:20:07,551 --> 00:20:10,262
The language you used
was foul, indisputably.

569
00:20:10,304 --> 00:20:12,514
But what's the difference
between me saying those words

00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:24,599
but you always seemed
to have a weird attitude

695
00:24:24,641 --> 00:24:26,626
whenever I brought up the 13.

696
00:24:26,651 --> 00:24:28,236
- You know what I'm talking about?
- Uh...

697
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:30,730
The 13 people I got
out of Germany in '43...

698
00:24:30,772 --> 00:24:32,798
No, I know who they are...

699
00:24:32,823 --> 00:24:36,336
At great cost, at great
sacrifice, I did that, Abe.

700
00:24:36,361 --> 00:24:39,447
I have nothing but admiration
for the great sacrifice you made

701
00:24:39,489 --> 00:24:41,700
to get those poor people
out of Germany, Moishe.

702
00:24:41,741 --> 00:24:44,578
- You do?
- Yes, very much.

703
00:24:46,071 --> 00:24:47,946
Good. Good.

704
00:24:49,618 --> 00:24:51,688
I'll take the offer, 50-50,
for the kids.

705
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:54,274
Thank you, Moishe.

706
00:24:54,431 --> 00:24:55,463
Look at this.

707
00:24:55,505 --> 00:24:57,174
- Huh?
- Look at this! Come here!

708
00:24:57,215 --> 00:24:58,592
- Oh. Okay.
- (LAUGHS)

709
00:24:58,633 --> 00:25:00,218
- You and me on the same side!
- Uh-huh.

710
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:02,387
- The Allies planning D-Day.
- Yeah, yes.

711
00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:03,722
And who's gonna stop us, huh?

712
00:25:03,763 --> 00:25:04,931
- No one's gonna stop us, Moishe.
- No.

713
00:25:04,973 --> 00:25:06,433
No one's gonna stop us.

714
00:25:06,474 --> 00:25:08,727
- No.
- Hey, wait a minute, wait, here we go.

715
00:25:09,024 --> 00:25:11,126
Take this for Rosie.

716
00:25:11,151 --> 00:25:13,148
- No, really, Moishe...
- When was the last time you came home

717
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:14,988
- with a gift for your wife?
- Fairly recently.

718
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,004
Take it.

719
00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:17,444
All right, fine, fine,
but here's some...

720
00:25:17,485 --> 00:25:19,237
What are you, crazy?
Your money's no good here.

721
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,072
All right. Now, that's very nice of you,

722
00:25:21,114 --> 00:25:22,365
but this is your business, and...

723
00:25:22,407 --> 00:25:23,876
Oh, no, I wouldn't hear of it.

724
00:25:24,431 --> 00:25:25,595
(LAUGHING): Well.

725
00:25:26,222 --> 00:25:27,743
Thank you for the coat, Moishe.

726
00:25:36,415 --> 00:25:37,797
Now we just have to figure out

727
00:25:37,839 --> 00:25:39,507
how to get Joel to the next step.

728
00:25:39,549 --> 00:25:41,593
- Oh, Joel will come back.
- What do you mean?

729
00:25:41,635 --> 00:25:43,220
I mean, I know my son.

730
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,296
Follow-through's
never been his strong suit.

731
00:25:45,321 --> 00:25:47,727
Tell Rosie not to worry, he'll be back.

732
00:25:49,483 --> 00:25:50,571
Partners!

733
00:25:51,376 --> 00:25:52,493
Ha, ha.

734
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:53,837
Yeah, Tuesday's fine.

735
00:25:54,189 --> 00:25:56,431
I got a 4:00 call,
then I'm in the clear.

736
00:25:57,234 --> 00:25:58,704
Hey, who else is gonna...

737
00:26:01,379 --> 00:26:02,696
Al, let me call you back.

738
00:26:05,329 --> 00:26:07,048
- Mr. Maisel.
- Yes?

739
00:26:23,454 --> 00:26:24,511
She's okay?

740
00:26:24,824 --> 00:26:25,954
She's okay.

741
00:26:33,686 --> 00:26:35,396
Welcome back, Mrs. Maisel.

742
00:26:35,782 --> 00:26:38,468
I see that you've posted
payment on your fine,

743
00:26:38,493 --> 00:26:41,470
and that you have something
you'd like to say to the court.

744
00:26:41,876 --> 00:26:42,923
Yes, Your Honor.

745
00:26:43,743 --> 00:26:47,242
My behavior earlier today
was irrational.

746
00:26:47,393 --> 00:26:49,019
JUDGE: Could you speak up, please?

747
00:26:50,829 --> 00:26:52,962
My behavior earlier today

748
00:26:53,352 --> 00:26:56,790
was irrational, irresponsible

749
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,407
and extremely disrespectful.

750
00:26:59,692 --> 00:27:02,688
I let my emotions get the better of me.

751
00:27:03,571 --> 00:27:05,969
After all, I am a woman.

752
00:27:06,579 --> 00:27:09,139
And therefore, I humbly apologize.

753
00:27:09,548 --> 00:27:11,220
Good, good.

754
00:27:11,485 --> 00:27:14,352
Now my original inclination
was to dismiss these charges,

755
00:27:14,394 --> 00:27:18,688
but in view of what happened
here today, I offer this:

756
00:27:19,149 --> 00:27:22,321
plead guilty, and you'll
be sentenced to time served.

757
00:27:22,595 --> 00:27:24,654
Otherwise, you can risk trial,

758
00:27:24,821 --> 00:27:27,220
where the maximum fine
will be a thousand dollars

759
00:27:27,245 --> 00:27:29,063
and up to three months in jail.

760
00:27:29,409 --> 00:27:32,070
- Three months?
- Now, as you consider this,

761
00:27:32,095 --> 00:27:33,830
please think long and hard

762
00:27:33,872 --> 00:27:36,204
about how generous
I'm feeling right now,

763
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:39,845
and about how easy it would be
to make me angry again.

764
00:27:43,493 --> 00:27:46,235
- I plead guilty, Your Honor.
- JUDGE: Good!

765
00:27:46,329 --> 00:27:48,178
The defendant pleads guilty
on all counts,

766
00:27:48,219 --> 00:27:50,399
and she is sentenced to time served.

767
00:27:50,985 --> 00:27:53,350
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Yes, thank you, Your Honor.

768
00:27:53,391 --> 00:27:55,769
You're welcome, Mrs. Maisel.
And by the way,

769
00:27:55,810 --> 00:27:58,243
that is a lovely dress you are wearing.

770
00:28:01,524 --> 00:28:02,827
Hang on to my card.

771
00:28:02,852 --> 00:28:04,626
Uh, I think you're gonna need it.

772
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:08,259
I'm burning this dress when I get home.

773
00:28:09,626 --> 00:28:11,743
Oh, God, I'm gonna be so late for Ethan.

774
00:28:11,785 --> 00:28:14,993
HEY, GET THIS: the horse fucker
was a flasher, so I was close.

775
00:28:15,266 --> 00:28:16,634
- Susie.
- Huh?

776
00:28:17,766 --> 00:28:19,540
- Tell me it's gonna work.
- What?

777
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:23,241
This comedy thing,
I'm-I'm staking a lot on it.

778
00:28:23,266 --> 00:28:26,421
It's gonna affect
my whole family, it has to work.

779
00:28:26,446 --> 00:28:27,467
Of course it's gonna work.

780
00:28:27,509 --> 00:28:30,585
No, I mean, it really has to work.

781
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:32,097
Miriam, it's okay.

782
00:28:32,138 --> 00:28:33,973
I have been gearing up for this
my entire life.

783
00:28:34,015 --> 00:28:36,374
I have got a plan. It is long term,

784
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:39,062
and I swear to you, it is gonna work.

785
00:28:55,274 --> 00:28:56,663
JOEL: All right, just keep in mind

786
00:28:56,704 --> 00:28:58,665
that Dow Chemical always slows
down around the holidays.

787
00:28:58,706 --> 00:29:01,376
So, someone should drop by
their Jersey plant, like now,

788
00:29:01,418 --> 00:29:03,503
to see them in person,
check in on the pipeline.

789
00:29:03,545 --> 00:29:05,187
Please don't make me go to Jersey.

790
00:29:05,212 --> 00:29:07,827
- Don, you're going to Jersey.
- Oh, I don't get a say?

791
00:29:07,852 --> 00:29:10,301
- Seniority counts for something, Donny.
- They like us there.

792
00:29:10,343 --> 00:29:11,886
Let them show you around,
take you to lunch.

793
00:29:11,928 --> 00:29:13,096
Just don't get too drunk.

794
00:29:13,138 --> 00:29:14,570
Ha! Good luck with that.

795
00:29:14,595 --> 00:29:16,774
- Help Don out on his travel?
- Certainly.

796
00:29:17,391 --> 00:29:19,470
- Come back a conqueror.
- You got it, boss.

797
00:29:20,186 --> 00:29:22,230
- Hey, you up for a drink?
- Can't.

798
00:29:22,272 --> 00:29:23,940
The missus talked me into
bowling with some couples

799
00:29:23,982 --> 00:29:25,525
from her literary improvements club.

800
00:29:25,567 --> 00:29:27,290
- Ouch.
- Tag along.

801
00:29:27,626 --> 00:29:29,460
You and I can drink and
they can all keep pretending

802
00:29:29,485 --> 00:29:30,835
they liked The World of Suzie Wong.

803
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,198
- I'll pass.
- I figured.

804
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,200
Hey, if you don't eat
before you get home,

805
00:29:34,242 --> 00:29:35,743
Imogene left you some meatloaf
in the fridge.

806
00:29:35,785 --> 00:29:37,537
- Oh, I'll be fine.
- Sitter will be there at 7:00,

807
00:29:37,579 --> 00:29:39,080
but she knows
you got first dibs on the TV.

808
00:29:39,122 --> 00:29:41,207
Yeah, listen, Arch, you know,

809
00:29:41,249 --> 00:29:42,667
I'm not gonna be on your couch forever.

810
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:44,437
- I promise.
- What are you talking about?

811
00:29:44,462 --> 00:29:47,005
This is great. You're like
the pet we never had.

812
00:29:47,046 --> 00:29:49,507
Yeah, well, I'm working on
a plan, just so you know.

813
00:29:49,549 --> 00:29:51,176
Sure, sure. Get your own place.

814
00:29:51,217 --> 00:29:52,532
You get your name up in lights.

815
00:29:52,649 --> 00:29:55,188
- What?
- Joel Maisel, king of comedy.

816
00:29:55,368 --> 00:29:58,308
Oh, yeah, right.
Well, we'll see about that.

817
00:29:58,626 --> 00:30:00,685
Let's get Mason's sign-off over at Dow

818
00:30:00,727 --> 00:30:02,061
and then we can talk
about king of comedy.

819
00:30:02,103 --> 00:30:03,354
Okay. Oh, hey.

820
00:30:03,446 --> 00:30:04,907
Uh, for the sitter.

821
00:30:05,732 --> 00:30:07,192
All right. Bowling alley's in Jersey.

822
00:30:07,233 --> 00:30:09,194
- There's no escaping Jersey.
- (CHUCKLES)

823
00:30:09,235 --> 00:30:10,487
Mr. Maisel.

824
00:30:10,528 --> 00:30:12,181
Yes, Mrs. Moskowitz?

825
00:30:12,259 --> 00:30:14,970
It's Penny on the line, again.

826
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:18,860
- Tell her I left already.
- Yes, sir.

about packing it in

Isn't that right, guys?

868

I wasn't belligerent during the set.

Nah, you were just missing
notes during the set.

you're missing the notes?

- What?
- Spitting, yeah.

I thought it was some
Eastern European potpourri.

1061
00:39:09,456 --> 00:39:11,875
- You can't stay here.
- Then kick me out.

No takers?

knock me out into the street.

I'll take it from here, guys.

Wow, George Jessel looks like
he fell in a vat of fries.

1077
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:45,048
Did I miss your call?

1078
00:39:45,315 --> 00:39:47,884
- I didn't call.
- Couldn't scrape up a nickel?

1079
00:39:48,276 --> 00:39:50,063
Didn't want to deal with
your idiot secretary.

1080
00:39:50,118 --> 00:39:51,860
I hate her. I hate all secretaries.

1081
00:39:51,885 --> 00:39:53,899
They're worthless.
What's the name of yours?

1082
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:55,493
- Sandra.
- Mm.

1083
00:39:55,623 --> 00:39:57,416
Yeah, she's half moron, half boobs.

1084
00:39:57,567 --> 00:39:59,321
And 100% my wife.

1085
00:39:59,911 --> 00:40:01,704
Really? Since when?

1086
00:40:01,729 --> 00:40:04,565
A few months ago. I'm sorry you
weren't invited to the wedding.

1087
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:06,024
Mm, I'll go to the next one.

1088
00:40:06,105 --> 00:40:08,446
So I sent this kid down to the Gaslight,

1089
00:40:08,477 --> 00:40:09,782
he's working up a set.

1090
00:40:09,993 --> 00:40:12,126
Fellow named Langford. You catch him?

1091
00:40:12,634 --> 00:40:14,886
I caught the whiff.
I can still smell it.

1092
00:40:15,157 --> 00:40:16,368
No good, huh?

1093
00:40:16,471 --> 00:40:19,391
Well, he helped tune the piano,
so it wasn't a complete loss.

1094
00:40:19,416 --> 00:40:22,919
Susie, um, don't take this
the wrong way,

1095
00:40:22,944 --> 00:40:25,634
but, uh, what the hell
are you doing here?

1096
00:40:26,002 --> 00:40:30,852
Well, I'm thinking about getting
into management, like you.

1097
00:40:30,903 --> 00:40:32,863
- Well, there's no one like me.
- I know.

1098
00:40:33,233 --> 00:40:34,734
I mean, you discovered a lot of people.

1099
00:40:34,759 --> 00:40:36,135
Good people, funny people.

1100
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,287
I mean, you put Jerry and Dean
together, for Christ's sake.

1101
00:40:38,535 --> 00:40:40,579
You're the only one I can stand
in this stupid business.

1102
00:40:40,620 --> 00:40:41,727
I love you, too.

1103
00:40:42,247 --> 00:40:45,259
I found somebody, and she is impulsive

1104
00:40:45,542 --> 00:40:48,727
and intuitive and hysterical,
and I think she's gonna be big.

1105
00:40:48,752 --> 00:40:49,753
She sing?

1106
00:40:49,778 --> 00:40:51,610
No, Harry, she's a comic.

1107
00:40:51,635 --> 00:40:52,673
Okay, okay.

1108
00:40:52,698 --> 00:40:54,282
Female comics are a tough sell.

1109
00:40:54,307 --> 00:40:56,376
- What's her name?
- I'm not gonna tell you.

1110
00:40:56,401 --> 00:40:58,001
Then you're gonna go after her,
and I'll be stuck with your

1111
00:40:58,026 --> 00:41:01,531
brother's nephew's son's camp
counselor you sent to me last year.

1112
00:41:01,556 --> 00:41:04,001
All right, all right.
She'll remain nameless.

1113
00:41:04,212 --> 00:41:07,230
She's special.
I mean, raw, unpredictable.

1114
00:41:07,272 --> 00:41:09,743
And we are going forward
in a big, aggressive way.

1115
00:41:09,768 --> 00:41:11,854
- Well, that sounds great.
- It is.

1116
00:41:11,879 --> 00:41:13,907
- I just, I got one question.
- Shoot.

1117
00:41:15,657 --> 00:41:16,899
What the hell do I do?

1118
00:41:17,821 --> 00:41:20,040
(CHUCKLES) One question, huh?

1119
00:41:21,351 --> 00:41:23,673
Okay, lesson one,

1120
00:41:24,144 --> 00:41:25,954
learn how to deal with secretaries.

1121
00:41:27,071 --> 00:41:29,446
Call and set up a lunch.

1122
00:41:29,842 --> 00:41:31,876
It's a much longer conversation.

1123
00:41:37,087 --> 00:41:39,720
- No, the guy's name is Tanner,
- MAN: Taxi!

1124
00:41:39,745 --> 00:41:41,681
- and it's on Lenox.
- Right, the guy's Lanner,

1125
00:41:41,723 --> 00:41:43,563
- and it's on Tennox, I got it.
- You got shit.

1126
00:41:43,588 --> 00:41:45,384
- You're going with me.
- Fine, I'll go with you.

1127
00:41:45,409 --> 00:41:46,556
Just be gentle.

1128
00:41:47,204 --> 00:41:50,548
Hey, we're going up
to an after-hours in Harlem.

1129
00:41:50,573 --> 00:41:51,743
Do you want to tag along?

1130
00:41:51,768 --> 00:41:53,306
Oh, I-I think I'm gonna head home.

1131
00:41:53,331 --> 00:41:54,329
Okay.

1132
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:56,884
I did pretty good
for my first night of freedom.

1133
00:41:56,909 --> 00:41:58,962
- Freedom?
- Yeah.

1134
00:41:59,899 --> 00:42:01,157
My husband left me.

1135
00:42:01,759 --> 00:42:03,649
- Oh, shit.
- Yeah.

1136
00:42:04,601 --> 00:42:05,665
It's, uh...

1137
00:42:07,760 --> 00:42:11,180
Uh-oh, you need me to be
understanding or something?

1138
00:42:11,597 --> 00:42:13,243
I can pretend to do that.

1139
00:42:13,568 --> 00:42:14,688
It is what it is.

1140
00:42:15,923 --> 00:42:18,641
Here, take this one. We'll grab another.

1141
00:42:19,285 --> 00:42:20,360
Thanks.

1142
00:42:22,869 --> 00:42:24,579
- LINDSEY: Night, Midge.
- MAN: Night, Midge.

1143
00:42:29,959 --> 00:42:31,149
For later.

1144
00:42:35,919 --> 00:42:38,505
- Riverside and 113th.
- DRIVER: Sure.

1145
00:42:38,835 --> 00:42:39,977
See ya, Midge.

1146
00:42:40,183 --> 00:42:41,290
Bye, Lenny.

1147
00:42:44,575 --> 00:42:47,009
Wait, was I supposed to
make a pass at you?

1148
00:42:52,604 --> 00:42:56,509
Dad, you know I look up to you,
and I respect you.

1149
00:42:57,509 --> 00:42:59,907
And I know that you've always thought

1150
00:42:59,932 --> 00:43:01,798
that I'd follow you
into the business here.

1151
00:43:02,569 --> 00:43:05,212
But I'm not you. I'm me.

1152
00:43:06,706 --> 00:43:09,524
Now, you and Mom sacrificed a lot,

1153
00:43:10,228 --> 00:43:12,355
and you've given me every opportunity,

1154
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:14,907
but, Dad, I want to make it
somewhere on my own.

1155
00:43:15,166 --> 00:43:16,306
Like you did.

1156
00:43:16,352 --> 00:43:18,665
Y-You came to New York
without a nickel in your pocket,

1157
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:21,032
and you built something,
you forged your own path.

1158
00:43:21,750 --> 00:43:23,165
So let me forge mine.

1159
00:43:25,017 --> 00:43:27,384
Well, that's a very sound argument, son.

1160
00:43:27,676 --> 00:43:29,848
You're a brilliant man... I have faith

1161
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:31,134
that you know what you're doing,

1162
00:43:31,295 --> 00:43:33,446
and you can achieve anything
you set your mind to.

1163
00:43:34,250 --> 00:43:35,485
Now, take off your clothes.

1164
00:43:36,129 --> 00:43:38,173
Okay, see, I don't think
my father's gonna say that.

1165
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:40,298
- He might.
- You're not taking this seriously.

1166
00:43:40,389 --> 00:43:41,462
- I am.
- You're not.

1167
00:43:41,487 --> 00:43:43,298
Okay, I'm gonna think of serious things

1168
00:43:43,323 --> 00:43:45,212
to get myself in a serious
frame of mind.

1169
00:43:45,492 --> 00:43:48,454

do you really think this is a good idea?

1173
00:43:56,407 --> 00:43:57,907
It's a very sound argument.

I've been thinking a lot
about our situation...

1190
00:44:58,892 --> 00:45:00,040
where we are.

1191
00:45:00,477 --> 00:45:01,610
I'm on a couch.

1192
00:45:02,221 --> 00:45:05,126
And you, I mean, I don't know
what happened today.

1193
00:45:05,208 --> 00:45:06,954
I don't know what
you needed the money for,

1194
00:45:07,196 --> 00:45:08,196
and I don't care.

1195
00:45:08,221 --> 00:45:09,571
I promised I wouldn't ask.

1196
00:45:10,059 --> 00:45:12,353
But clearly, things aren't going great

1197
00:45:12,378 --> 00:45:13,688

1198
00:45:14,689 --> 00:45:16,227

00:45:39,866 --> 00:45:41,284
What are you doing down here?

1204
00:45:41,309 --> 00:45:44,657
Well, I brought Ethan down
a few hours ago.

1205
00:45:45,232 --> 00:45:46,704
He likes his bed,

1206
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:50,184
and he was staring at Rose
in a very weird way.

1207
00:45:50,209 --> 00:45:51,610
Sure, yeah.

1208
00:45:53,505 --> 00:45:54,634
Are you okay?

1209
00:45:56,479 --> 00:45:57,812
Joel was downstairs.

1210
00:45:58,459 --> 00:45:59,501
Here?

1211
00:46:01,946 --> 00:46:02,993
What did he want?

1212
00:46:03,526 --> 00:46:05,290
He wanted to give it another go.

1213
00:46:05,854 --> 00:46:07,022
Really?

1214
00:46:08,451 --> 00:46:09,610
Well...

1215
00:46:12,001 --> 00:46:13,438
what did you say?

1216
00:46:15,556 --> 00:46:16,673
No.

1217
00:46:20,565 --> 00:46:21,673
No?

1218
00:46:24,148 --> 00:46:25,251
Why?

1219
00:46:26,713 --> 00:46:28,110
Because you left.
