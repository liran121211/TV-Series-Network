[tapping on glass]

3
00:00:08,942 --> 00:00:10,178
Shh!

4
00:00:11,781 --> 00:00:14,282
Woman: Who gives a
toast at her own wedding?

5
00:00:15,783 --> 00:00:16,950
I mean, who does that?

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:18,469
Who stands in the middle of a ballroom

7
00:00:18,494 --> 00:00:19,953
after three glasses of champagne

8
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,369
on a completely empty stomach...

9
00:00:21,394 --> 00:00:23,508
and I mean completely empty

10
00:00:23,533 --> 00:00:24,696
because fitting into this dress

11
00:00:24,721 --> 00:00:27,461
required no solid food
for three straight weeks.

12
00:00:27,777 --> 00:00:29,011
Who does that?

13
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,127
I do.

14
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:38,939
This day is perfect.

15
00:00:39,006 --> 00:00:40,308
It's like a dream...

16
00:00:40,374 --> 00:00:42,576
or a nightmare if you're my father.

17
00:00:42,601 --> 00:00:44,102
"How much for the flowers?"

18
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,555
"Who eats mushroom caps?"

19
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:46,689
"Do the caterers have any idea

20
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:49,212
"what the Jews just went
through a few years ago?"

21
00:00:49,237 --> 00:00:50,744
Two cakes, one for eating.

22
00:00:50,769 --> 00:00:52,220
- We're very happy.
- [laughter]

23
00:00:52,286 --> 00:00:55,165
This day has been long in planning.

24
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:57,079
Anyone who knows me knows I plan.

25
00:00:57,104 --> 00:01:00,157
At 6 I decided Russian
literature would be my major.

26
00:01:00,182 --> 00:01:02,385
At 12 I found my signature haircut.

27
00:01:02,451 --> 00:01:03,852
At 13 I announced

28
00:01:03,919 --> 00:01:06,138
I was going to Bryn Mawr College.

29
00:01:06,163 --> 00:01:08,023
In Katharine Hepburn's old room.

30
00:01:08,056 --> 00:01:09,863
From Day 1 I knew...

31
00:01:09,888 --> 00:01:11,293
that decision was a charmed one.

32
00:01:12,099 --> 00:01:13,462
♪ Did you say ♪

33
00:01:13,529 --> 00:01:17,099
♪ I've got a lot to learn? ♪

34
00:01:17,403 --> 00:01:19,761
First of all, my roommate
Petra was friendly and fat,

35
00:01:19,802 --> 00:01:21,596
which was perfect. I'll
have someone to eat with

36
00:01:21,670 --> 00:01:23,160
who won't steal my boyfriend.

37
00:01:23,185 --> 00:01:25,136
It smells so good. [giggling]

38
00:01:25,161 --> 00:01:27,910
The campus was old and elegant,

39
00:01:27,976 --> 00:01:31,819
with ivy-covered buildings
and stained glass windows

40
00:01:31,844 --> 00:01:33,048
and...

41
00:01:33,115 --> 00:01:35,283
Monogrammed butter pats.

42
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,952
What? [gasp] Oh.

43
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:38,621
This was a magical place

44
00:01:38,687 --> 00:01:40,088
where butter was beautiful

45
00:01:40,155 --> 00:01:42,057
and I would solve the
mysteries of the universe

46
00:01:42,124 --> 00:01:44,727
and meet brilliant
women, kindred spirits

47
00:01:44,793 --> 00:01:47,696
who would explore this
brave new world with me.

48
00:01:47,763 --> 00:01:49,287
Ooh! My God, it's burning.

49
00:01:49,312 --> 00:01:50,799
It's supposed to. It's bleach.

50
00:01:50,824 --> 00:01:52,201
It's awful. I hate you for this.

51
00:01:52,226 --> 00:01:53,335
It was your idea.

52
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,053
Never listen to me. I'm nuts.

53
00:01:55,078 --> 00:01:56,580
Why aren't you in pain?

54
00:01:56,605 --> 00:01:58,115
I'm from Kansas.

55
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,475
I don't know what that means.

56
00:01:59,542 --> 00:02:00,922
- How much longer?
- Ten minutes.

57
00:02:00,947 --> 00:02:02,377
Oh, Jiminy Crickets.

58
00:02:02,402 --> 00:02:05,104
Where are you going? Where is she going?

59
00:02:05,213 --> 00:02:06,797
I don't know.

60
00:02:06,822 --> 00:02:09,691
Midge. Midge?

61
00:02:09,828 --> 00:02:11,078
Midge!

62
00:02:11,297 --> 00:02:13,522
- How much longer?
- Nine minutes!

63
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:16,659
- Holy fucking Christ balls!
- [laughter]

64
00:02:16,725 --> 00:02:18,026
But all of these marvelous adventures

65
00:02:18,093 --> 00:02:20,796
were simply the preamble
to my ultimate destiny.

66
00:02:20,863 --> 00:02:23,678
I was going to meet a man...

67
00:02:23,703 --> 00:02:25,394
a perfect man.

68
00:02:25,419 --> 00:02:27,936
He would be 6'4" and blond,

69
00:02:28,003 --> 00:02:31,139
and his name would be
Dashiell or Stafford or...

70
00:02:31,206 --> 00:02:33,630
Joel. Joel Maisel.

71
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,859
Best build-up since Iceman Cometh.

72
00:02:39,999 --> 00:02:43,952
Joel Maisel was my
knight in shining armor,

73
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:45,089
a gift from God,

74
00:02:45,114 --> 00:02:46,689
and he thought I was brilliant.

75
00:02:46,755 --> 00:02:50,092
He took me to galleries
and poetry readings

76
00:02:50,158 --> 00:02:51,794
and Greek dramas.

77
00:02:53,095 --> 00:02:54,497
[wolf whistle]

78
00:02:58,934 --> 00:03:00,435
[wolf whistle]

79
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,474
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me, Miss.

80
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:06,909
Thanks, toots.

81
00:03:06,975 --> 00:03:09,444
Man: Honey, don't go away.

82
00:03:09,667 --> 00:03:11,079
She's going to need that.

83
00:03:11,146 --> 00:03:12,648
[laughing]

84
00:03:12,715 --> 00:03:17,152
That was Misty Dream,
ladies and gentlemen.

85
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:19,835
You know, she's only 18...

86
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:21,562
in dog years.

87
00:03:21,587 --> 00:03:25,474
Anyway, I'll leave the
jokes to our next performer.

88
00:03:25,499 --> 00:03:28,564
He's fresh out of the Merchant Marines

89
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:32,590
or some patriotic shit like that.

90
00:03:32,637 --> 00:03:35,037
And, uh, let's hear it for him...

91
00:03:35,103 --> 00:03:36,815
Lenny Bruce. Come up.

92
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,373
This is the guy I wanted you to see.

93
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,475
No way he's funnier than Misty.

94
00:03:40,543 --> 00:03:41,977
Thank you.

95
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:44,031
And so I was reading the paper,

96
00:03:44,056 --> 00:03:45,514
and, uh, there was a story.

97
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:48,250
These kids... uh, 8 and 9-year-old...

98
00:03:48,316 --> 00:03:52,429
were sniffing airplane
glue to get high on.

99
00:03:52,454 --> 00:03:54,599
These kids are responsible
for turning musicians

100
00:03:54,624 --> 00:03:57,138
on to a lot of things they
never knew about, actually.

101
00:03:57,169 --> 00:03:59,628
Then I had a fantasy of how it happened.

102
00:03:59,896 --> 00:04:01,564
The kid is alone in his room.

103
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,129
It's Saturday.

104
00:04:03,154 --> 00:04:05,771
The kid is played by George Macready.

105
00:04:07,035 --> 00:04:08,036
[sniffing]

106
00:04:08,103 --> 00:04:09,247
[as George Macready]
Well, let's see now.

107
00:04:09,272 --> 00:04:11,724
I'm all alone in a
room, and it's Saturday.

108
00:04:11,755 --> 00:04:13,542
I'll make an airplane.
That's what I'll do.

109
00:04:13,609 --> 00:04:15,052
I'll make a Lancaster.

110
00:04:15,077 --> 00:04:16,545
Good structural design.

111
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:18,238
I'll get the balsa wood here.

112
00:04:18,263 --> 00:04:20,482
I'll cut it out. I'll sand it down.

113
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:22,168
Add a little airplane glue.

114
00:04:22,193 --> 00:04:24,219
I'll rub it on a rag and, uh...

115
00:04:24,286 --> 00:04:26,388
[sniff]

116
00:04:26,454 --> 00:04:29,257
- Hey now.
- [laughter]

117
00:04:29,324 --> 00:04:31,265
I'm getting loaded.

118
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:35,015
Midge: Oh, the things Joel taught me.

119
00:04:35,468 --> 00:04:38,400
- You know what I want?
- Please don't say a virgin.

120
00:04:38,466 --> 00:04:40,186
I want to make you laugh...

121
00:04:40,211 --> 00:04:41,779
every day of your life.

122
00:04:41,804 --> 00:04:43,538
Oh, great, but not now, though.

123
00:04:43,606 --> 00:04:45,708
- No, no, not now.
- Mm-mm.

124
00:04:47,242 --> 00:04:49,211
I have been very lucky.

125
00:04:49,277 --> 00:04:51,079
I have wonderful parents.

126
00:04:51,146 --> 00:04:52,848
I've had a very comfortable life,

127
00:04:52,915 --> 00:04:54,549
and though I knew that
love would be great,

128
00:04:54,617 --> 00:04:56,251
I had no idea it would be anything

129
00:04:56,318 --> 00:04:58,220
that could justify what
I paid for this dress.

130
00:04:58,286 --> 00:05:01,060
What I paid for that
dress. We're very happy.

131
00:05:01,085 --> 00:05:04,278
And because it's better than
anything I could have imagined,

132
00:05:04,303 --> 00:05:06,129
I thought I should get up here today

133
00:05:06,194 --> 00:05:09,723
and tell all of you
that I love this man.

134
00:05:09,748 --> 00:05:11,145
[clapping]

135
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,501
And yes, there is
shrimp in the egg rolls.

136
00:05:13,568 --> 00:05:15,441
- [gasping]

[murmuring]

139
00:05:18,273 --> 00:05:20,493
- We have a problem.
- Rabbi, she's kidding. She's kidding.

[arguing]

141
00:05:22,845 --> 00:05:24,146
You show me in the Bible

142
00:05:24,212 --> 00:05:25,755
where God says you can't eat shrimp.

143
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,250
Leviticus. "Whatever does
not have fins or scales,

144
00:05:28,316 --> 00:05:30,285
- "you shall not eat."
- But did He say shrimp?

00:06:50,432 --> 00:06:52,446
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Maisel.

00:06:53,135 --> 00:06:54,669

- Hello.
- You tell everyone about the rabbi?

195
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:38,541
What am I, a braggart?
Please. How's work?

196
00:07:38,566 --> 00:07:40,403
- I believe something got sold today.
- Hmm.

197
00:07:40,428 --> 00:07:43,285
- How's the brisket?
- I'm buying it a sash and a crown.

198
00:07:43,310 --> 00:07:44,520
Good. We'll need it.

199
00:07:44,545 --> 00:07:46,948
I got a terrible stage
time for tonight: 1:45.

200
00:07:46,973 --> 00:07:48,656
- Yikes.
- I bowed out of my lunch meeting

201
00:07:48,723 --> 00:07:50,158
and got downtown as quickly as I could.

202
00:07:50,225 --> 00:07:51,894
But that guy who runs the Gaslight...

203
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,531
Baz. You must learn his name.

204
00:07:53,579 --> 00:07:56,156
Fine. Baz still gave
me the crappiest time.

205
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:58,100
- He hates me.
- Don't worry. We'll fix it.

206
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,935
He doesn't see me as a real comedian.

207
00:08:00,002 --> 00:08:01,929
I mean, I'm not a real comedian yet,

208
00:08:01,954 --> 00:08:03,346
but if he'd just give
me a better time...

209
00:08:03,371 --> 00:08:05,255
- We will fix it.
- 1:45.

210
00:08:05,302 --> 00:08:06,674
No one is there at 1:45.

211
00:08:06,741 --> 00:08:08,347
They're not? Well, then we'll fix it.

212
00:08:08,372 --> 00:08:09,644
I don't know what I'd do without you.

213
00:08:09,711 --> 00:08:12,036
- Go on at 1:45.
- Bye.

214
00:08:12,061 --> 00:08:13,949
So the waiter says, "Fine. I'll try it."

215
00:08:14,016 --> 00:08:15,150
He looks at the bowl

216
00:08:15,217 --> 00:08:16,651
and says "Where the hell is the spoon?"

217
00:08:16,718 --> 00:08:18,854
And the customer says "Aha."

218
00:08:18,921 --> 00:08:20,522
So he didn't bring him a spoon.

219
00:08:20,588 --> 00:08:21,863
[laughing]

220
00:08:21,888 --> 00:08:23,363
And that's why he didn't eat the soup.

221
00:08:23,388 --> 00:08:24,726
No spoon.

222
00:08:24,793 --> 00:08:26,661
Well, you can't eat
a soup with no spoon.

223
00:08:26,728 --> 00:08:29,647
- Oh, boy. That's a good joke there.
- Yeah. Uh-huh.

224
00:08:29,672 --> 00:08:32,887
Penny, can you walk
Mitchell down to Al's office?

225
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:34,502
- Of course.
- Al can take you through the specs.

226
00:08:34,527 --> 00:08:37,920
Okay. Boy, I'll be laughing
about that spoon for a week.

227
00:08:37,945 --> 00:08:39,365
[laughing]

228
00:08:43,245 --> 00:08:44,412
Oi.

229
00:08:57,868 --> 00:08:59,369
I saw Funt heading down the hall.

230
00:08:59,394 --> 00:09:01,897
I sent him over to
Al's office. He's fine.

231
00:09:01,964 --> 00:09:03,365
You heading down to the Village tonight?

232
00:09:03,431 --> 00:09:05,037
Midge will be here any minute.

00:09:07,069 --> 00:09:08,169
All right, all right.

235
00:09:08,194 --> 00:09:09,740
You know, Imogene's
dying to see your act.

236
00:09:09,765 --> 00:09:10,881
I told her I don't know why.

237
00:09:10,906 --> 00:09:12,669
I see you acting
ridiculous all day long.

238
00:09:12,694 --> 00:09:14,349
Very amusing. Can I use that?

239
00:09:14,374 --> 00:09:16,168
Seriously, when can we come?

240
00:09:16,193 --> 00:09:17,793
I have a cab waiting downstairs.

241
00:09:17,818 --> 00:09:19,691
- Hi, Archie.
- Why'd you have him wait?

242
00:09:19,716 --> 00:09:20,904
We could have taken another cab.

243
00:09:20,929 --> 00:09:22,717
I know, but the driver's having
trouble with his marriage,

244
00:09:22,784 --> 00:09:24,458
and I hated to send him off like that.

245
00:09:24,483 --> 00:09:26,183
So I'll come next week?

246
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,331
Next week. Why not?

00:09:28,356 --> 00:09:30,052

00:13:43,119 --> 00:13:44,687
You're thinking of shaving it off?

357
00:13:44,754 --> 00:13:46,083
Uh, Abe,

358
00:13:46,108 --> 00:13:48,090
don't you see that's part of the image?

359
00:13:48,158 --> 00:13:50,826
Right, with the shawl
and the stove pipe hat

360
00:13:50,893 --> 00:13:52,539
and the string tie.

361
00:13:53,563 --> 00:13:55,231
You don't have the shawl?

362
00:13:55,298 --> 00:13:56,602

363
00:13:56,627 --> 00:13:58,539
Where's the shawl, Abe?

364
00:13:58,836 --> 00:14:00,498
You left it in Washington?

365
00:14:00,523 --> 00:14:02,004
What are you wearing, Abe?

366
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,828
A sort of cardigan?

367
00:14:03,853 --> 00:14:05,827
Abe, don't you see that doesn't go

368
00:14:05,852 --> 00:14:07,421
with the string tie and beard?

369
00:14:07,446 --> 00:14:08,952
[laughter]

370
00:14:08,977 --> 00:14:11,813
Abe, would you leave the beard
on and get the shawl, huh?

371
00:14:11,838 --> 00:14:13,162
[laughter]

372
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:15,389
All right, now, Abe, you
got your speech, right?

373
00:14:15,414 --> 00:14:18,020
Abe, you haven't changed
the speech, have you?

374
00:14:18,087 --> 00:14:20,190
$3.30 and one subway token.

375
00:14:20,256 --> 00:14:21,357
I'll take that token.

376
00:14:21,424 --> 00:14:23,125
Tonight was great. I killed.

377
00:14:23,193 --> 00:14:24,760
I had a good time, so I killed.

378
00:14:24,869 --> 00:14:27,605
I need an audience. I
feed off an audience.

379
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,665
I finished, people started
to leave. Did you see that?

380
00:14:29,732 --> 00:14:30,933
I almost left myself.

381
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,335
10:30. Perfect slot.

382
00:14:32,402 --> 00:14:33,936
Give me that slot again next time.

383
00:14:34,003 --> 00:14:35,999
Hey. here.

384
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:39,493
Saw your act.

385
00:14:43,362 --> 00:14:45,185
Don't forget the latkes.

386
00:14:47,013 --> 00:14:49,252
- Who's that guy?
- She works there.

387
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:51,904
Heh heh. Only in the Village.

388
00:14:52,087 --> 00:14:53,356
Taxi!

389
00:14:53,423 --> 00:14:55,849
You got three more laughs
tonight than you did last time,

390
00:14:55,874 --> 00:14:58,769
and a couple of extra, like, laughlets.

391
00:14:58,794 --> 00:15:00,796
But what you were shaking your head for?

392
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:03,966
- Hmm?
- Nothing. You were great.

393
00:15:04,221 --> 00:15:06,307
I was great.

394
00:15:06,889 --> 00:15:08,158
You know,

395
00:15:08,183 --> 00:15:11,716
you don't really say
hello to the audience.

396
00:15:11,741 --> 00:15:13,276
Maybe you should write a beginning,

397
00:15:13,343 --> 00:15:15,581
something that says who
you are or something.

398
00:15:15,606 --> 00:15:16,955

"Nice" is a bad, bad word.

404
00:15:33,297 --> 00:15:34,832
All that applause for me?

405
00:15:34,857 --> 00:15:36,849
What am I, putting out after?

406
00:15:37,481 --> 00:15:40,384
One standing ovation,
everyone goes home pregnant.

407
00:15:44,374 --> 00:15:46,242
Maybe you could do impressions to start.

408
00:15:46,309 --> 00:15:49,172
You do a great one of my

Yes, and a great welcome from my son.

- Men.
- Thanks for taking the kids last night.

447
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:01,036
- Were they okay?
- We need to talk about the baby.

Why? What's the matter with her?

449
00:19:04,925 --> 00:19:06,970
That forehead is not improving.

- What? Are you sure?
- It's getting bigger.

451

The whole face will
be out of proportion.

452
00:19:10,356 --> 00:19:12,423
Look at the nose. It's elongating now.

453
00:19:12,448 --> 00:19:15,084
The nose is not the problem.
The nose you can fix.

- But this gigantic forehead.
- Ma, there's always bangs.

I'm just afraid she's
not a very pretty girl.

- Mama, she's a baby.
- I just want her to be happy.

457
00:19:22,229 --> 00:19:24,034
It's easier to be happy
when you're pretty.

Zelda, don't clean in here.
It's fine just the way it is.

461
00:19:37,339 --> 00:19:39,108
How did Joel's little show go?

462
00:19:39,174 --> 00:19:40,409
It went very well.

463
00:19:40,434 --> 00:19:42,235
I still don't understand
this whole thing.

Whom is he performing for?

00:19:43,813 --> 00:19:45,848
- Anyone who shows up.
- And they pay you?

466
00:19:45,915 --> 00:19:47,550
They pass around a basket
at the end of your set,

467
00:19:47,575 --> 00:19:49,142
and whatever's in it
you get to take home.

468
00:19:49,167 --> 00:19:50,720
If you need money,
we can give you money.

469
00:19:50,745 --> 00:19:51,886
No, we don't need money.

470
00:19:51,911 --> 00:19:54,353
Joel is funny, and he
likes to do his comedy.

471
00:19:54,378 --> 00:19:55,658
How long are you going to be doing this,

472
00:19:55,725 --> 00:19:58,815
running around at night, taking
money from strangers like a schnorrer?

exercises with the soup cans.

476
00:20:04,676 --> 00:20:06,502
Forget the cans. Buy a bolero.

477
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:07,770
How did you get in here?

478
00:20:07,837 --> 00:20:09,190
Zelda: I came through the other door.

479
00:20:09,215 --> 00:20:11,688
Just because there is a door
does not mean you use it.

480
00:20:11,713 --> 00:20:13,909
A door does not represent
infinite possibilities.

00:20:13,976 --> 00:20:16,376
- Is everything ordered for next week?
- Yes, all done.

482
00:20:16,401 --> 00:20:18,748
- Ethan, put your coat on.
- You have a whole apartment to clean.

483
00:20:18,814 --> 00:20:20,482
Just leave this room the way it is.

484
00:20:20,550 --> 00:20:21,917
I thought we'd do dinner at your place.

00:20:21,984 --> 00:20:24,274
- Your dining room's bigger than ours.
- Our dining room is fine.

- We're very excited.
- Don't except too much.

528
00:21:40,318 --> 00:21:41,530
Oh, you'd better be great.

529
00:21:41,597 --> 00:21:42,898
I'm going to wear a beret.

530
00:21:42,965 --> 00:21:44,033
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

531
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:46,846
- Mwah. Goodbye, Joel.
- Bye.

532
00:21:46,871 --> 00:21:49,855
Ah, the curry's terrible.
We'll have the takeout.

533
00:21:50,355 --> 00:21:51,924
Bob Newhart: You've seen
one, you've seen them all.

534
00:21:51,949 --> 00:21:53,275
[chuckling]

535
00:21:53,342 --> 00:21:55,656
Right. Uh, listen, Abe, I got...

536
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,409
What's the problem?

537
00:21:57,434 --> 00:22:00,382
Y-you're thinking of shaving it off?

538
00:22:00,449 --> 00:22:01,917
[laughter]

539
00:22:01,984 --> 00:22:03,218
Uh, Abe,

540
00:22:03,285 --> 00:22:05,440
don't you see that's part of the image?

541
00:22:05,465 --> 00:22:09,447
Right, with the shawl and the
stove pipe hat and the string tie.

542
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:11,126
You don't have the shawl?

543
00:22:11,151 --> 00:22:12,169
[laughter]

544
00:22:12,194 --> 00:22:15,033
- Uh, where's the shawl, Abe?
- Joel?

545
00:22:15,259 --> 00:22:16,632
Joel.

546
00:22:17,118 --> 00:22:18,600
You're not gonna believe this.

547
00:22:18,668 --> 00:22:20,569
Bob Newhart is doing your act.

548
00:22:20,636 --> 00:22:22,541
- What?
- Bob Newhart.

549
00:22:22,566 --> 00:22:24,877
He's on "Ed Sullivan."
He's doing your act.

550
00:22:24,902 --> 00:22:27,019
He must have come to the club
one night and seen you perform,

551
00:22:27,044 --> 00:22:29,418
and now he's on television
doing it just like you do.

552
00:22:29,443 --> 00:22:31,119
Well, it's a little bit different
because he does it faster,

553
00:22:31,144 --> 00:22:33,849
which is better, actually,
but that's besides the point.

554
00:22:33,916 --> 00:22:35,284
I'm mad. Aren't you mad?

555
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,618
Midge, relax.

556
00:22:36,678 --> 00:22:37,834
You're not mad.

557
00:22:37,881 --> 00:22:38,988
No.

558
00:22:39,054 --> 00:22:40,389
Or stunned.

559
00:22:40,455 --> 00:22:42,191
Not even mildly bemused?

560
00:22:42,257 --> 00:22:43,896
It's his act.

561
00:22:44,581 --> 00:22:45,849
What?

562
00:22:45,874 --> 00:22:47,670
Are you gonna put the
rest of this on a platter?

563
00:22:47,695 --> 00:22:49,832
How is it his act? How
do you know his act?

564
00:22:49,899 --> 00:22:51,400
I've got his record.

565
00:22:51,466 --> 00:22:53,568
So you stole Bob Newhart's act.

566
00:22:53,635 --> 00:22:55,611
It's fine. Everybody does it.

567
00:22:55,636 --> 00:22:57,837
- Everybody steals his act?
- Yes.

568
00:22:57,862 --> 00:22:59,696
No. Not steals.

569
00:22:59,721 --> 00:23:01,751
Borrows. It's no big deal.

570
00:23:01,776 --> 00:23:03,045
It's not? When I found out

571
00:23:03,112 --> 00:23:04,613
June Freedman used my meatloaf recipe,

572
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:06,391
I almost stabbed her
in the eye with a fork.

573
00:23:06,416 --> 00:23:08,805
- Everybody in comedy steals...
- Borrows.

574
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,920
... borrows everybody else's jokes,

575
00:23:10,945 --> 00:23:12,121
especially at the beginning.

576
00:23:12,187 --> 00:23:14,189
Bob Newhart probably used
Henny Youngman's stuff

577
00:23:14,256 --> 00:23:15,390
when he started.

578
00:23:15,457 --> 00:23:17,523
- It's how it's done.
- Oh.

579
00:23:17,727 --> 00:23:20,329
- Well, if that's how it's done.
- It is.

580
00:23:22,497 --> 00:23:24,333
I thought you'd written it...

581
00:23:24,399 --> 00:23:25,628
that act.

582
00:23:28,385 --> 00:23:29,839
I feel a little silly now.

583
00:23:29,905 --> 00:23:32,274
Well, I did put my spin on it.

584
00:23:32,341 --> 00:23:34,659
- Yes. You slowed it down.
- And my inflection is different.

585
00:23:34,684 --> 00:23:37,189
Right. I'm new to this, so...

586
00:23:37,214 --> 00:23:39,614
- You'll learn.
- I guess I will.

587
00:23:39,681 --> 00:23:42,118
- You want a drink?
- Sure.

588
00:23:45,241 --> 00:23:48,177
Guess I'd better go apologize
to June Freedman now.

589
00:23:57,959 --> 00:24:00,061
[phone rings]

590
00:24:03,336 --> 00:24:04,600
- Hello.
- How's the brisket?

591
00:24:04,625 --> 00:24:06,225
- Is it okay?
- Do you know something I don't?

592
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,476
Just answer the question, Midge.

593
00:24:07,542 --> 00:24:08,811
Yes. It's fine. What's the matter?

594
00:24:08,878 --> 00:24:10,279
I had to work straight through lunch,

595
00:24:10,345 --> 00:24:12,563
so I couldn't go downtown
to get a time for tonight.

596
00:24:12,948 --> 00:24:14,884
- Tonight, you understand?
- Tonight. Yes, I understand.

597
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,500
Archie and Imogene are coming, remember?

598
00:24:16,525 --> 00:24:17,554
Of course I remember.

599
00:24:17,579 --> 00:24:20,089
They're coming tonight,
and I don't have a time.

600
00:24:20,155 --> 00:24:22,091
You know what? Cancel
them. Tell them I'm sick.

601
00:24:22,157 --> 00:24:23,658
They've got a babysitter.
It's all arranged.

602
00:24:23,725 --> 00:24:25,194
I should have changed
that lunch, damn it.

603
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,796
Joel, come on. I promise you'll get on.

604
00:24:26,862 --> 00:24:28,530
I'll bring the brisket.
I'll do my thing.

605
00:24:28,597 --> 00:24:30,238
Everything will be fine, okay?

606
00:24:30,263 --> 00:24:32,034
- Okay.
- Hey.

607
00:24:32,101 --> 00:24:33,502
Remember this whole comedy thing,

608
00:24:33,568 --> 00:24:34,636
it's supposed to be fun.

609
00:24:34,703 --> 00:24:36,105
That's why we do it, right?

610
00:24:36,171 --> 00:24:37,873
Right. Well, you'll have to bring me

611
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,341
my show sweater. I left it at home.

612
00:24:39,408 --> 00:24:41,410
- I can do that.
- And you have to be here right at 8.

613
00:24:41,476 --> 00:24:42,786
I will be on time.

614
00:24:42,811 --> 00:24:44,379
Okay. I should go.

615
00:24:46,115 --> 00:24:47,582
[exhale]

616
00:24:47,649 --> 00:24:48,918
Huh.

617
00:24:49,476 --> 00:24:51,912
Your daddy is crazy.

618
00:24:52,756 --> 00:24:55,045
Now let's measure that forehead.

619
00:24:57,745 --> 00:24:59,463
Pull over here. I'll just be a minute.

620
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,002
- Oh, geez.
- Where the hell have you been?

621
00:25:02,027 --> 00:25:03,197
- It's 8:30.
- I know. I'm sorry.

622
00:25:03,222 --> 00:25:04,967
Go. Go, go.

623
00:25:10,372 --> 00:25:11,907
- Do you have my sweater?
- Yes.

624
00:25:11,974 --> 00:25:13,221
You didn't have to stand out there.

625
00:25:13,246 --> 00:25:15,948
- I would have come up.
- You get here at 8, you come up.

626
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,546
Are you kidding me?

627
00:25:17,612 --> 00:25:19,014
- What?
- Holes.

628
00:25:19,081 --> 00:25:20,673
- Holes everywhere.
- What?

629
00:25:20,698 --> 00:25:22,339
I can't believe you didn't look
at it before you left the house.

630
00:25:22,364 --> 00:25:24,519
I was in a hurry to meet
you. You can hardly see them.

631
00:25:24,586 --> 00:25:26,048
Hardly see? Look, look.

632
00:25:26,073 --> 00:25:28,858
A hole here, a hole
here, two holes here.

633
00:25:28,924 --> 00:25:30,182
I mean, how does this happen?

634
00:25:30,207 --> 00:25:31,660
It was probably a moth.

635
00:25:31,726 --> 00:25:33,362
- A moth?
- Yes.

636
00:25:33,428 --> 00:25:34,596
What moth?

637
00:25:34,663 --> 00:25:35,998
Ted. Ted the Moth.

638
00:25:36,065 --> 00:25:37,666
Dime-sized holes, that's his signature.

639
00:25:37,732 --> 00:25:39,854
- You think this is funny?
- I think it doesn't matter.

640
00:25:39,879 --> 00:25:41,893
Going on stage with holes
in my shirt like a bum.

641
00:25:41,918 --> 00:25:45,004
It's downtown. If you have
underwear on, you're overdressed.

642
00:25:47,076 --> 00:25:49,011
Hey, why don't you talk about it?

643
00:25:49,078 --> 00:25:50,312
- About what?
- About your sweater.

644
00:25:50,379 --> 00:25:51,813
You know, joke about it in your act.

645
00:25:51,838 --> 00:25:53,739
It'll be fun, personal, yours.

646
00:25:53,849 --> 00:25:54,950
I don't know.

647
00:25:55,017 --> 00:25:56,537
Oh, great. They're here.

648
00:25:56,562 --> 00:25:57,853
Okay, why don't you go join them,

649
00:25:57,920 --> 00:25:59,554
have a cup of coffee, calm down?

650
00:25:59,621 --> 00:26:00,922
I'll go deal with this, okay?

651
00:26:00,947 --> 00:26:03,893
- Yeah, fine. Hurry.
- Mm-hmm.

652
00:26:07,796 --> 00:26:09,736
Excuse me. Is Baz around?

653
00:26:09,761 --> 00:26:11,029
Nope.

654
00:26:14,589 --> 00:26:15,924
Excuse me.

655
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:19,953
Um, do you see my husband
Joel Maisel over there?

656
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,996
Okay. He couldn't get away from work

657
00:26:23,021 --> 00:26:25,847
to come down here earlier
for a time to perform.

658
00:26:25,872 --> 00:26:27,349
He's a comedian.

659
00:26:27,839 --> 00:26:29,384
Anyhow, it was a crazy day at work,

660
00:26:29,409 --> 00:26:31,020
and, see, tonight our
best friends are here...

661
00:26:31,086 --> 00:26:32,554
- the Clearys, and...
- Wait a minute.

662
00:26:32,621 --> 00:26:34,214
The Clearys are here?

663
00:26:34,239 --> 00:26:36,519
- You're kidding me. Where?
- Over there.

664
00:26:38,227 --> 00:26:40,750
Well, I will be damned.

665
00:26:40,775 --> 00:26:43,665
Well, that is exciting.
The Clearys are here.

666
00:26:43,732 --> 00:26:45,034
Wow.

667
00:26:47,769 --> 00:26:49,204
Anyhow,

668
00:26:49,271 --> 00:26:51,240
I was wondering if you could find a way

669
00:26:51,306 --> 00:26:53,321
to give my husband a better time...

670
00:26:53,346 --> 00:26:55,039
preferably before 11:30.

671
00:26:55,064 --> 00:26:56,737
- Why isn't he over here?
- What?

672
00:26:56,762 --> 00:26:58,775
Mr. Saturday Night. Why
isn't he asking for the time?

673
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,534
Why are you asking for the time?

674
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,600
Well, I have the brisket.

675
00:27:05,387 --> 00:27:06,637
So...

676
00:27:06,662 --> 00:27:08,598
anything you can do would be great.

677
00:27:08,623 --> 00:27:10,625
So thanks.

678
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,097
That looks like Allen Ginsberg.

679
00:27:15,164 --> 00:27:16,909
Imogene, doesn't that
look like Allen Ginsberg?

680
00:27:16,934 --> 00:27:18,867
Everyone here looks like Allen Ginsberg.

681
00:27:18,934 --> 00:27:20,202
- Hey, there, kitten.
- Hi.

682
00:27:20,269 --> 00:27:22,135
This place is perfectly filthy.

683
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,432
- You should see the bathroom.
- Don't go in the bathroom.

684
00:27:24,457 --> 00:27:25,863
Well, now I'm definitely
going in the bathroom.

685
00:27:25,888 --> 00:27:27,342
[Archie, Midge laugh]

686
00:27:27,409 --> 00:27:29,152
- Oh.
- Archie: No, no. I got this.

687
00:27:29,177 --> 00:27:30,908
A starving artist never pays.

688
00:27:30,933 --> 00:27:33,548
- I'm not a starving artist.
- Your sweater tells another story.

689
00:27:33,615 --> 00:27:34,816
Here you go.

690
00:27:34,883 --> 00:27:36,918
So? What did he say?

691
00:27:36,986 --> 00:27:38,187
Uh, he wasn't there,

692
00:27:38,253 --> 00:27:40,636
but the lady said she'd work it out.

693
00:27:42,124 --> 00:27:44,159
[tuning up]

694
00:27:46,061 --> 00:27:48,632
Man: Now who here likes hillbilly polka?

695
00:27:49,698 --> 00:27:51,366
All right, next up, a lady

696
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:53,757
fresh off some boat from somewhere.

697
00:27:53,782 --> 00:27:55,037
When the hell am I going on?

698
00:27:55,104 --> 00:27:57,625
- I don't know. Soon.
- Janet Shaw.

699
00:28:01,943 --> 00:28:03,278
Woman: All right.

700
00:28:03,563 --> 00:28:05,847
This poem is about...

701
00:28:06,172 --> 00:28:07,740
Spokane.

702
00:28:11,214 --> 00:28:12,815
Spokane...

703
00:28:14,023 --> 00:28:15,457
Spokane.

704
00:28:17,026 --> 00:28:18,427
Spokane.

705
00:28:20,429 --> 00:28:21,963
Man.

706
00:28:23,965 --> 00:28:25,200
[whisper] I'll be right back.

707
00:28:25,267 --> 00:28:27,942
Rumble of lumber trucks.

708
00:28:28,737 --> 00:28:29,827
Spokane.

709
00:28:29,852 --> 00:28:31,215
- Where is she?
- Who?

710
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,807
The one who looks like
she lives under a bridge.

711
00:28:32,874 --> 00:28:34,776
Oh. Susie. She went out.

712
00:28:34,843 --> 00:28:35,977
Do you know where?

713
00:28:36,045 --> 00:28:37,412
God, no. Who would ask?

714
00:28:37,479 --> 00:28:40,082
Poet: Robbers of the indigenous.

715
00:28:40,149 --> 00:28:41,583
- Any minute now.
- Spokane.

716
00:28:41,608 --> 00:28:43,210
Kitten, we're going to
have to take a rain check.

717
00:28:43,235 --> 00:28:44,553
Oh, it was a blast, though.

718
00:28:44,619 --> 00:28:46,288
Oh, no, wait... wait just a few minutes.

719
00:28:46,355 --> 00:28:47,471
We got to head home, too.

720
00:28:47,496 --> 00:28:49,096
- We can't leave.
- I have an early morning meeting.

721
00:28:49,121 --> 00:28:52,138
I say we just tell everybody
it was Allen Ginsberg.

722
00:28:52,194 --> 00:28:53,767
- You're up.
- [gasp]

723
00:28:54,293 --> 00:28:55,972
What? What did he say?

724
00:28:55,997 --> 00:28:58,708
- I think she said you're up.
- Imogene: Oh, goodie.

725
00:29:00,368 --> 00:29:01,536
Man.

726
00:29:03,605 --> 00:29:04,939
[applause]

727
00:29:05,177 --> 00:29:07,209
Emcee: Thank you, Janet Shaw.

728
00:29:07,276 --> 00:29:09,480
Don't need to go to Spokane now.

729
00:29:09,505 --> 00:29:12,214
All right, up next, we have a comedian.

730
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:14,136
That's you. Go. Be funny.

731
00:29:14,161 --> 00:29:15,231
[giggling]

732
00:29:15,256 --> 00:29:16,957
- Joel Maisel.
- Whoo!

733
00:29:18,511 --> 00:29:19,808
Whoo!

734
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,324
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

735
00:29:22,391 --> 00:29:24,159
- So exciting.
- [giggling]

736
00:29:25,753 --> 00:29:27,191
So...

737
00:29:27,649 --> 00:29:29,230
my sweater...

738
00:29:29,764 --> 00:29:31,500
It's a new sweater,

739
00:29:31,566 --> 00:29:33,402
but I asked my wife to bring it to me

740
00:29:33,468 --> 00:29:34,926
because I work during the day,

741
00:29:34,951 --> 00:29:37,372
so she does, and I put it on.

742
00:29:37,996 --> 00:29:39,480
Holes.

743
00:29:39,902 --> 00:29:41,706
Holes in my sweater.

744
00:29:49,284 --> 00:29:50,627
So I asked, "How did this happen?"

745
00:29:50,652 --> 00:29:52,053
And she says "Moths."

746
00:29:52,121 --> 00:29:53,955
And I'm like, "Moths? What moths?"

747
00:29:54,022 --> 00:29:55,624
And she says "Ted."

748
00:29:58,267 --> 00:29:59,734
"Ted the Moth."

749
00:30:00,529 --> 00:30:02,097
[audience member coughing]

750
00:30:02,164 --> 00:30:04,333
[whisper] He's very avant garde.

751
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,268
Th-that was just...
that was just something

752
00:30:06,335 --> 00:30:09,129
that, uh... happened.

753
00:30:09,696 --> 00:30:10,722
[door closes]

754
00:30:10,747 --> 00:30:13,184
Okay. So, uh, uh...

755
00:30:13,408 --> 00:30:14,643
anyhow, this is, uh,

756
00:30:14,709 --> 00:30:17,395
a press agent talking to Abe Lincoln.

757
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:20,081
Hi, Abe, sweetheart. How's Gettys...

758
00:30:20,149 --> 00:30:23,418
Sorry. Did... did any of you read
the book The Hidden Persuaders?

759
00:30:23,485 --> 00:30:24,686
It's about marketing agents,

760
00:30:24,753 --> 00:30:26,441
- and they had to create Abe Lincoln.
- [coughing]

761
00:30:26,466 --> 00:30:29,027
I mean, if they had
to create Abe Lincoln.

762
00:30:29,291 --> 00:30:31,461
The book's not about that. Uh...

763
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:33,795
this... this bit...

764
00:30:33,862 --> 00:30:35,096
Anyhow...

765
00:30:37,232 --> 00:30:39,334
Hi, Abe, sweetheart. How's Gettysburg?

766
00:30:39,401 --> 00:30:41,194
Kind of a drag, huh?

767
00:30:41,219 --> 00:30:43,338
Well, Abe, you know them
small Pennsylvania towns...

768
00:30:43,405 --> 00:30:45,168
you seen one, you seem them all.

769
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:46,608
What's the problem?

770
00:30:46,675 --> 00:30:48,610
You're thinking of shaving it off?

771
00:30:48,677 --> 00:30:50,044
[toilet flushes]

772
00:30:50,199 --> 00:30:52,113
Uh, Abe, don't you see?

773
00:30:52,181 --> 00:30:54,516
That's, uh... that doesn't go
with the string tie and b...

774
00:30:54,583 --> 00:30:56,644
Don't you see that's part of the image?

775
00:30:56,669 --> 00:30:59,772
Right, with the shawl and the
stove pipe hat and the string tie.

776
00:31:08,763 --> 00:31:11,700
You told me to talk about my sweater.

777
00:31:11,766 --> 00:31:13,222
I know.

778
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:15,715
I just thought you'd put it

779
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,110
into some sort of
joke form or something.

780
00:31:19,608 --> 00:31:20,925
Sorry.

781
00:31:28,883 --> 00:31:30,151
Don't.

782
00:31:49,238 --> 00:31:51,171
Can I get you anything?

783
00:32:20,302 --> 00:32:21,785
What are you doing?

784
00:32:22,832 --> 00:32:24,503
I have to go.

785
00:32:25,407 --> 00:32:27,043
I have to leave.

786
00:32:28,527 --> 00:32:30,974
You. I have to leave you.

787
00:32:32,481 --> 00:32:34,182
That's my suitcase.

788
00:32:34,249 --> 00:32:35,669
It is?

789
00:32:36,509 --> 00:32:38,974
You going to leave me with my suitcase?

790
00:32:39,155 --> 00:32:40,889
Joel, tomorrow's Yom Kippur.

791
00:32:40,914 --> 00:32:42,491
I'm... I'm... I'm not happy.

792
00:32:42,557 --> 00:32:44,593
Nobody's happy. It's Yom Kippur.

793
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:46,060
I don't know how to do this.

794
00:32:46,127 --> 00:32:47,329
I'm not good at things like this.

795
00:32:47,396 --> 00:32:48,697
Things like what? Like leaving me?

796
00:32:48,763 --> 00:32:51,013
- Yes.
- So don't. Practice a little.

797
00:32:51,038 --> 00:32:52,777
Try it again when you feel
more confident about the moves.

798
00:32:52,802 --> 00:32:54,474
- Midge...
- Joel, the rabbi is coming.

799
00:32:54,499 --> 00:32:55,604
Yeah. I know he is.

800
00:32:55,670 --> 00:32:57,232
Five years we've been
trying to get the rabbi,

801
00:32:57,257 --> 00:32:58,907
and this year we got
him. We got the rabbi.

802
00:32:58,973 --> 00:33:02,090
- I should go.
- No. P-Please. I don't understand.

803
00:33:02,115 --> 00:33:04,161
I thought my life was going
to be something different.

804
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:06,349
I thought I was going
to be someone different,

805
00:33:06,374 --> 00:33:07,630
but tonight was just so terrible.

806
00:33:07,655 --> 00:33:10,118
I mean, a whole room full of
people just watching me bomb.

807
00:33:10,184 --> 00:33:12,354
- It was one stupid night.
- And I'm up there dying,

808
00:33:12,421 --> 00:33:13,588
and I'm thinking about last week.

809
00:33:13,655 --> 00:33:15,089
We're in temple, and the rabbi tells

810
00:33:15,156 --> 00:33:16,558
that stupid Sodom and Gomorrah joke,

811
00:33:16,625 --> 00:33:18,373
and suddenly the whole
synagogue goes nuts.

812
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:20,228
- So?
- He got more laughs in five minutes

813
00:33:20,295 --> 00:33:21,596
than I did in five months.

814
00:33:21,663 --> 00:33:23,131
You're jealous of the rabbi?

815
00:33:23,197 --> 00:33:24,866
He was in Buchenwald. Throw him a bone.

816
00:33:24,891 --> 00:33:26,868
Did you ever think you were
supposed to be something,

817
00:33:26,935 --> 00:33:29,738
and, uh, and you suddenly
realize you're not?

818
00:33:29,769 --> 00:33:31,743
Yes. Married.

819
00:33:31,768 --> 00:33:33,369
- That's good. You're good.
- Joel, please.

820
00:33:33,394 --> 00:33:35,472
I'm never going to be a
professional comedian, Midge.

821
00:33:35,497 --> 00:33:37,652
- Never.
- No, of course not.

822
00:33:38,313 --> 00:33:39,970
What do you mean, of course not?

823
00:33:39,995 --> 00:33:41,424
What do you mean, what do I mean?

824
00:33:41,449 --> 00:33:43,251
What did you think all those
nights at the club were?

825
00:33:43,318 --> 00:33:44,653
I thought they were fun.

826
00:33:44,719 --> 00:33:46,187
I thought they were
our fun couples thing,

827
00:33:46,254 --> 00:33:47,783
like how the Morgensterns play golf

828
00:33:47,808 --> 00:33:49,123
or how the Meyers ballroom dance

829
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:51,005
or how the Levins pretend
they're from Warsaw once a week

830
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,627
to get 10% off of that Polish restaurant

831
00:33:52,694 --> 00:33:54,629
- that does Kielbasa Night.
- I can't believe this.

832
00:33:54,696 --> 00:33:56,097
I never knew you were serious about it.

833
00:33:56,164 --> 00:33:57,699
Of course I was serious, Miriam.

834
00:33:57,766 --> 00:33:59,668
What the hell ever made
you think I wasn't serious?

835
00:33:59,734 --> 00:34:02,169
Well, for starters, you were
doing someone else's act.

836
00:34:02,194 --> 00:34:04,958
I told you, everybody
does that when they start.

837
00:34:04,983 --> 00:34:07,374
If you wanted to be a comedian, you
should have at least written a joke.

838
00:34:07,399 --> 00:34:09,319
I tried with the Ted thing.

839
00:34:09,344 --> 00:34:10,812
- I wrote the Ted thing.
- And it bombed.

840
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:12,681
- Because you killed it.
- Oh, forget it.

841
00:34:12,747 --> 00:34:14,483
Joel, come on. You have a job.

842
00:34:14,549 --> 00:34:16,764
Yet the comedy was a dream.

843
00:34:16,796 --> 00:34:18,453
Do you know what a dream is?

844
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:21,272
A dream is what keeps you
going in a job you hate.

845
00:34:21,297 --> 00:34:23,193
Since when do you hate your job?

846
00:34:23,218 --> 00:34:24,879
Do you know what I do, Midge?

847
00:34:24,904 --> 00:34:27,153
- You're the vice president of...
- No, no, no, no.

848
00:34:27,178 --> 00:34:28,972
Do you know what I do every day?

849
00:34:28,997 --> 00:34:30,411
Day in and day out,

850
00:34:30,436 --> 00:34:32,567
what the actual physical
machinations of my job are?

851
00:34:32,634 --> 00:34:34,145
- No.
- Neither do I!

852
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:36,571
I take meetings. I take phone calls.

853
00:34:36,638 --> 00:34:37,906
I shuffle paper around,

854
00:34:37,972 --> 00:34:40,208
and I have no idea of what
the hell I actually do.

855
00:34:40,274 --> 00:34:42,019
Maybe if you did, you'd like it more.

856
00:34:42,847 --> 00:34:45,769
I just thought, with the
brisket and the notebook,

857
00:34:46,313 --> 00:34:48,048
I thought you understood.

858
00:34:49,217 --> 00:34:50,985
I'm sorry.

859
00:34:51,725 --> 00:34:54,714
Yeah. Me, too.

860
00:34:54,878 --> 00:34:57,058
But, Joel, you can't just leave.

861
00:34:57,125 --> 00:34:58,386
I love you.

862
00:34:58,411 --> 00:35:00,916
We have a home. We have children.

863
00:35:00,941 --> 00:35:02,363
- They're going to notice.
- I have to go.

864
00:35:02,431 --> 00:35:04,096
No, no, no. Wait. I will be better.

865
00:35:04,121 --> 00:35:06,760
I will do better. I... I'll...
I'll pay more attention.

866
00:35:06,785 --> 00:35:07,877
You can quit your job.

867
00:35:07,902 --> 00:35:09,303
We can go to the club
every single night,

868
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:10,405
and I'll buy more notebooks.

869
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:11,959
I've been having an affair.

870
00:35:14,242 --> 00:35:15,477
It's been going on for months.

871
00:35:15,544 --> 00:35:18,012
- I thought it was a phase, but now...
- Who?

872
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,724
Penny.

873
00:35:23,051 --> 00:35:24,373
Your secretary.

874
00:35:26,088 --> 00:35:27,356
You're leaving me for a girl

875
00:35:27,381 --> 00:35:28,590
who can't figure out
how to sharpen pencils?

876
00:35:28,657 --> 00:35:30,450
It's not about her, and
it was a new sharpener.

877
00:35:30,475 --> 00:35:32,461
It was electric. All
she had to do was push.

878
00:35:32,486 --> 00:35:34,321
Don't you understand?
I need to start over.

879
00:35:34,429 --> 00:35:37,264
- With her? She wins?
- It's not a contest.

880
00:35:37,289 --> 00:35:38,667
I just don't want this life,

881
00:35:38,733 --> 00:35:40,669
this whole upper West Side,

882
00:35:40,735 --> 00:35:42,990
classic six, best seats in temple.

883
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,717
Wife, two kids.

884
00:35:44,939 --> 00:35:46,811
I just don't...

885
00:35:48,401 --> 00:35:49,861
want it.

886
00:35:54,884 --> 00:35:57,095
So you'll tell your parents for me?

887
00:36:02,297 --> 00:36:05,254
Oh, that might be the funniest
thing you've ever said.

888
00:36:05,279 --> 00:36:06,461
- Honey...
- Tomorrow is Yom Kippur.

889
00:36:06,504 --> 00:36:09,106
I have 30 people and a rabbi
coming over for break fast,

890
00:36:09,131 --> 00:36:10,924
and this is the moment
you decide to tell me

891
00:36:10,949 --> 00:36:12,809
you're going to ride off into the sunset

892
00:36:12,834 --> 00:36:14,836
with your half-wit secretary.

893
00:36:14,903 --> 00:36:16,166
Can I just say...

894
00:36:16,191 --> 00:36:20,606
that you have the worst timing ever?

895
00:36:21,154 --> 00:36:22,588
I'm sorry.

896
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:24,879
Go on. Get out.

897
00:36:24,946 --> 00:36:26,447
Grab some pens on your way out.

898
00:36:26,515 --> 00:36:28,051
You're going to need them.

899
00:36:43,698 --> 00:36:46,100
[Woman singing in French]

900
00:36:53,093 --> 00:36:54,543
Jerry: Good evening, Mr. Maisel.

901
00:36:54,609 --> 00:36:56,110
Going on a trip?

902
00:37:20,301 --> 00:37:22,236
Papa.

903
00:37:22,591 --> 00:37:24,105
Rose.

904
00:37:24,172 --> 00:37:25,661
Papa.

905
00:37:25,686 --> 00:37:27,036
Rose.

906
00:37:27,061 --> 00:37:28,295
Papa, wait. I... I just...

907
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:30,464
- Rose!
- I'm here. My God.

908
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:32,714
What are you wearing? It's not thinning.

909
00:37:32,781 --> 00:37:34,669
I have something to tell you.

910
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:36,387
You should both sit.

911
00:37:40,696 --> 00:37:42,312
Joel left.

912
00:37:42,857 --> 00:37:44,425
He packed up my suitcase,

913
00:37:44,492 --> 00:37:46,060
and he left.

914
00:37:46,317 --> 00:37:47,651
He's gone.

915
00:37:47,676 --> 00:37:49,706
Joel left you?

916
00:37:49,731 --> 00:37:51,333
Yes.

917
00:37:51,358 --> 00:37:53,334
Why? What did you do?

918
00:37:53,401 --> 00:37:55,637
Nothing. I didn't do anything.

919
00:37:55,704 --> 00:37:57,980
He's... he's in love with his secretary.

920
00:37:58,005 --> 00:37:59,940
Did you know this? Did you
know he was having an affair?

921
00:37:59,965 --> 00:38:01,746
- Of course I didn't know.
- [loud clatter]

922
00:38:01,771 --> 00:38:02,911
- God.
- The girl, is she...

923
00:38:03,019 --> 00:38:04,387
Oh, my God. Is she pregnant?

924
00:38:04,412 --> 00:38:05,458
- [loud clatter]
- Shit.

925
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:06,617
Did you talk like that around him?

926
00:38:06,642 --> 00:38:08,770
- Did you use sailor talk?
- No, I didn't use sailor talk.

927
00:38:08,795 --> 00:38:10,192
She must've been pregnant.
A man doesn't leave

928
00:38:10,217 --> 00:38:11,247
unless the girlfriend is pregnant.

929
00:38:11,272 --> 00:38:12,890
What the hell is he doing in there?

930
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:13,989
- He's mad.
- At me?

931
00:38:14,014 --> 00:38:15,632
- Shh. They'll hear.
- Who'll hear?

932
00:38:15,657 --> 00:38:17,525
- Them. Them.
- Who is them?

933
00:38:17,592 --> 00:38:18,893
- [sobbing]
- Oh, God, Mama.

934
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,662
- [piano playing]
- Papa.

935
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:23,131
Papa.

936
00:38:23,197 --> 00:38:25,433
Why are you mad? I
didn't do anything wrong.

937
00:38:25,499 --> 00:38:28,670
When I agreed to send you to
that fancy goyische college,

938
00:38:28,737 --> 00:38:30,672
what was the one thing I told you?

939
00:38:30,739 --> 00:38:31,906
They'll have terrible deli?

940
00:38:31,973 --> 00:38:34,230
- The important thing I told you.
- That was about deli, too.

941
00:38:34,255 --> 00:38:36,458
The other important thing I told you!

942
00:38:36,845 --> 00:38:38,780
Don't pick a weak man.

943
00:38:38,847 --> 00:38:40,582
- Ah.
- [Rose sobbing]

944
00:38:40,855 --> 00:38:42,416
This isn't my fault!

945
00:38:42,483 --> 00:38:43,752
Of course it's your fault.

946
00:38:43,818 --> 00:38:45,553
Rose: Oh, shit!

947
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,088
Mama, please stop crying.

948
00:38:47,155 --> 00:38:49,512
Everything we bring on
ourselves is our own fault.

949
00:38:49,537 --> 00:38:51,926
He was a good husband.
He was a good provider.

950
00:38:51,993 --> 00:38:53,227
What are you going to do now?

951
00:38:53,294 --> 00:38:54,723
What are your children going to do?

952
00:38:54,748 --> 00:38:56,012
- [sobbing continues]
- Mama, for the love of God,

953
00:38:56,037 --> 00:38:58,121
please stop crying in that bedroom!

954
00:38:58,399 --> 00:38:59,868
This isn't fair.

955
00:39:00,443 --> 00:39:02,129
[sobbing] Oh, no!

956
00:39:02,154 --> 00:39:03,437
Much better. Thanks.

957
00:39:03,504 --> 00:39:04,967
Life isn't fair.

958
00:39:04,992 --> 00:39:07,099
It's hard and cruel.

959
00:39:07,141 --> 00:39:10,679
You have to pick your friends
as if there's a war going on.

960
00:39:10,745 --> 00:39:13,414
You want a husband who'll
take a bullet for you,

961
00:39:13,481 --> 00:39:14,783
not one who points to the attic

962
00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:15,984
and says "They're up there."

963
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:17,318
How can you say that about Joel?

964
00:39:17,385 --> 00:39:19,388
- You liked him.
- I knew what he was.

965
00:39:19,413 --> 00:39:20,554
Why didn't you tell me, then?

966
00:39:20,621 --> 00:39:22,390
- I did tell you!
- When did you tell me?

967
00:39:22,456 --> 00:39:23,758
When you first came home with him.

968
00:39:23,825 --> 00:39:25,493
That night. I looked at you.

969
00:39:25,559 --> 00:39:28,070
I asked, "Is this the choice?"

970
00:39:28,095 --> 00:39:29,497
And you said yes.

971
00:39:29,563 --> 00:39:30,865
That was telling me?

972
00:39:30,924 --> 00:39:32,153
I have to spell it out for you?

973
00:39:32,186 --> 00:39:33,668
Joel's sick. Everything's fine.

974
00:39:33,735 --> 00:39:35,224
Not a word of this to the rabbi.

975
00:39:35,249 --> 00:39:36,905
I'm going to take a bath.

976
00:39:38,357 --> 00:39:39,841
You listen to me, Miriam.

977
00:39:39,908 --> 00:39:42,811
You are a child. You
cannot survive this.

978
00:39:42,836 --> 00:39:45,572
Now, I am no fan of Joel's,
but you need a husband.

979
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,558
And those children need a father.

980
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:49,613
What am I supposed to do,
go buy one at Zaybar's?

981
00:39:49,638 --> 00:39:51,786
You fix your face. Put
on his favorite dress.

982
00:39:51,853 --> 00:39:53,365
Then you go out, find him,

983
00:39:53,390 --> 00:39:55,544
and make him come back home.

984
00:40:18,446 --> 00:40:20,112
[thunder rumbles]

985
00:40:39,730 --> 00:40:41,232
Mrs. Maisel, you all right?

986
00:40:41,269 --> 00:40:42,904
- Do you need a cab?
- Nope.

987
00:40:42,971 --> 00:40:44,311
Gonna take the subway.

988
00:40:44,336 --> 00:40:45,874
It's miserable out here.

989
00:40:45,940 --> 00:40:47,976
It's miserable in there, too.

990
00:41:05,968 --> 00:41:11,274
Man: See, the eternal war is here.

991
00:41:11,299 --> 00:41:16,070
O victory, forget your underwear.

992
00:41:16,137 --> 00:41:18,539
We're free.

993
00:41:18,909 --> 00:41:20,277
I'm with...

994
00:41:20,302 --> 00:41:22,527
I left my Pyrex here. I'd like it back.

995
00:41:22,552 --> 00:41:25,449
- Your what?
- Pyrex. My Pyrex.

996
00:41:25,474 --> 00:41:27,048
- Nope.
- It's a Pyrex.

997
00:41:27,115 --> 00:41:28,749
- Yeah, you keep saying that.
- Pyrex.

998
00:41:28,817 --> 00:41:31,151
It's a glass baking dish, very durable.

999
00:41:31,176 --> 00:41:32,653
It can go from hot to
cold without cracking.

1000
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,856
- We don't serve food here.
- I know. It's not yours.

1001
00:41:34,923 --> 00:41:36,604
It's mine. I brought it here.

1002
00:41:36,629 --> 00:41:38,134
- Why?
- I made a brisket f...

1003
00:41:38,192 --> 00:41:39,627
Is that really important right now?

1004
00:41:39,693 --> 00:41:41,029
My dish is here. I'd like it back.

1005
00:41:41,095 --> 00:41:42,296
Can you make that happen?

1006
00:41:42,347 --> 00:41:44,791
- [sigh] This place gets so weird late.
- [applause]

1007
00:41:44,816 --> 00:41:48,113
Emcee: That was deep,
Christian, I think. Who knows?

1008
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:50,715
Okay, next up. Uh...

1009
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:55,357
folks, just sit tight.
I'll be right back.

1010
00:41:55,435 --> 00:41:58,435
Bonnie, where's my set list?

1011
00:41:58,612 --> 00:42:01,115
[chatter]

1012
00:42:11,957 --> 00:42:13,928
So this is it, huh?

1013
00:42:13,995 --> 00:42:16,348
This is the dream...

1014
00:42:16,373 --> 00:42:20,869
standing up here on this
filthy, sticky stage all alone.

1015
00:42:21,183 --> 00:42:22,603
Couldn't have that, you didn't want me.

1016
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:24,238
Was that it, Joel?

1017
00:42:24,305 --> 00:42:25,949
Woman: Who's Joel?

1018
00:42:27,341 --> 00:42:28,501
What?

1019
00:42:28,526 --> 00:42:30,148
Who's Joel?

1020
00:42:30,266 --> 00:42:32,613
- My husband.
- Man: we can't hear you.

1021
00:42:32,680 --> 00:42:35,108
- Woman: Oh. Shh, shh, shh.
- Sorry.

1022
00:42:35,133 --> 00:42:37,852
Joel is my husband of four years,

1023
00:42:37,919 --> 00:42:40,121
- and tonight he left.
- Man: Whoo!

1024
00:42:40,188 --> 00:42:41,622
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1025
00:42:41,689 --> 00:42:44,125
Yep. He left... Joel.

1026
00:42:44,192 --> 00:42:47,569
Left. He packed up my suitcase and left.

1027
00:42:47,975 --> 00:42:49,697
Oh, I'm going to have
to lie to the rabbi

1028
00:42:49,763 --> 00:42:51,199
about why Joel's not there.

1029
00:42:51,265 --> 00:42:53,034
Lying to the rabbi on Yom Kippur.

1030
00:42:53,101 --> 00:42:54,903
I couldn't get a clean
slate for one fucking day.

1031
00:42:54,969 --> 00:42:56,770
I don't understand what's going on.

1032
00:42:56,837 --> 00:42:59,107
Me, either, sister, me, either.

1033
00:42:59,173 --> 00:43:03,344
There are so many questions
spinning around in my head.

1034
00:43:03,411 --> 00:43:04,946
Why did he leave?

1035
00:43:05,231 --> 00:43:07,348
Why wasn't I enough?

1036
00:43:07,716 --> 00:43:10,351
And why didn't they
put the stage over there

1037
00:43:10,418 --> 00:43:12,486
against that wall instead
of over here by the bathroom

1038
00:43:12,553 --> 00:43:15,460
so you wouldn't have to listen
to every giant bowel movement

1039
00:43:15,485 --> 00:43:17,614
- that takes place in there?
- [laughter]

1040
00:43:17,639 --> 00:43:19,622
Oh, yeah. Clear as a bell.

1041
00:43:19,647 --> 00:43:21,295
I'm sorry. I'm a little drunk.

1042
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,872
- It's all gone.
- [toilet flushes]

1043
00:43:22,912 --> 00:43:25,341
Everything I've counted on is gone.

1044
00:43:26,013 --> 00:43:27,707
You feeling better now?

1045
00:43:27,732 --> 00:43:29,267
[laughter]

1046
00:43:31,615 --> 00:43:33,874
So my life completely fell apart today.

1047
00:43:33,942 --> 00:43:35,944
Did I mention that my husband left me?

1048
00:43:36,018 --> 00:43:37,319
- Man: Whoo-hoo!
- [laughter]

1049
00:43:37,378 --> 00:43:39,413
Okay. All right. But did I mention

1050
00:43:39,438 --> 00:43:41,725
that he left me for his secretary?

1051
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:42,890
[wolf whistles]

1052
00:43:42,915 --> 00:43:43,942
Mm-hmm.

1053
00:43:43,967 --> 00:43:46,103
She's 21 and dumb as a Brillo pad.

1054
00:43:46,128 --> 00:43:47,480
And I'm not naive.

1055
00:43:47,505 --> 00:43:49,249
I know that men like stupid girls.

1056
00:43:49,274 --> 00:43:50,288
- Right?
- Uh...

1057
00:43:50,313 --> 00:43:51,789
But I thought Joel
wanted more than stupid.

1058
00:43:51,814 --> 00:43:54,694
I thought he wanted spontaneity and wit.

1059
00:43:54,719 --> 00:43:56,339
I thought he wanted to be challenged.

1060
00:43:56,364 --> 00:43:57,777
- You know what I mean?
- Uh...

1061
00:43:57,802 --> 00:43:59,400
You two are going to
be together forever.

1062
00:43:59,425 --> 00:44:00,439
[laughter]

1063
00:44:00,464 --> 00:44:01,559
I'll tell you this much.

1064
00:44:01,584 --> 00:44:02,885
I was a great wife.

1065
00:44:02,971 --> 00:44:05,239
I was fun. I planned theme nights.

1066
00:44:05,306 --> 00:44:08,409
I dressed in costumes.
I gave him kids...

1067
00:44:08,476 --> 00:44:09,944
a boy and a girl.

1068
00:44:10,011 --> 00:44:11,486
And yes, our little girl is looking

1069
00:44:11,511 --> 00:44:13,623
more and more like Winston
Churchill every day,

1070
00:44:13,648 --> 00:44:15,183
you know, with that big Yalta head.

1071
00:44:15,249 --> 00:44:17,683
But that's not a reason to leave, right?

1072
00:44:17,904 --> 00:44:20,654
Really? Really? After what I
just said about the bathroom?

1073
00:44:20,721 --> 00:44:21,746
[laughter]

1074
00:44:21,771 --> 00:44:23,276
Walk of shame.

1075
00:44:23,328 --> 00:44:26,394
Walk of shame!

1076
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,296
I loved him.

1077
00:44:29,775 --> 00:44:32,700
And I showed him I loved him.

1078
00:44:32,766 --> 00:44:33,913
- Whoo!
- [whistles]

1079
00:44:33,938 --> 00:44:35,103
All that shit they say

1080
00:44:35,128 --> 00:44:37,357
about Jewish girls in the bedroom?

1081
00:44:37,382 --> 00:44:39,974
Not true. There are French whores

1082
00:44:40,041 --> 00:44:42,572
standing around the
Marais District saying...

1083
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:43,944
[French accent] "Did
you hear what Midge did

1084
00:44:44,012 --> 00:44:45,748
to Joel's balls the other night?"

1085
00:44:45,773 --> 00:44:47,448
[laughter]

1086
00:44:49,183 --> 00:44:50,884
I can't believe this is happening.

1087
00:44:50,909 --> 00:44:54,616
I can't believe I'm
losing him to Penny Pan.

1088
00:44:54,922 --> 00:44:57,091
That's her name. Terrible, right?

1089
00:44:57,158 --> 00:45:00,330
Penny Pan. Penny Pan.

1090
00:45:00,682 --> 00:45:02,870
Penny Pan.

1091
00:45:02,895 --> 00:45:05,474
And I'm officially losing
my mind, which is perfect.

1092
00:45:05,499 --> 00:45:07,576
Now I will be alone and crazy,

1093
00:45:07,601 --> 00:45:11,590
the famous mad divorcée
of the upper West Side.

1094
00:45:13,107 --> 00:45:14,748
Upper West Side? Really? Where?

1095
00:45:14,773 --> 00:45:15,909
72nd and Amsterdam.

1096
00:45:15,976 --> 00:45:17,489
That place on the corner
with the courtyard?

1097
00:45:17,514 --> 00:45:19,826
- That's the one.
- Oh, that's nice. We looked there.

1098
00:45:19,851 --> 00:45:20,868
But the closets were so small,

1099
00:45:20,893 --> 00:45:22,717
and I wanted a powder room.

1100
00:45:23,393 --> 00:45:24,927
Do you know I've seen her twice

1101
00:45:24,952 --> 00:45:26,291
with her shirt on inside out?

1102
00:45:26,316 --> 00:45:27,796
Penny. Twice.

1103
00:45:27,821 --> 00:45:30,258
Once, fine. You were
rushed in the morning.

1104
00:45:30,324 --> 00:45:32,126
Twice, you can only be trusted

1105
00:45:32,193 --> 00:45:33,931
to butter people's
corn at the county fair.

1106
00:45:33,956 --> 00:45:35,090
[laughter]

1107
00:45:35,115 --> 00:45:36,528
And here's the worst thing.

1108
00:45:36,581 --> 00:45:41,001
And I know this is shallow
and petty and small,

1109
00:45:41,444 --> 00:45:43,037
but she's not even that pretty.

1110
00:45:43,104 --> 00:45:44,205
Man: Huh.

1111
00:45:44,272 --> 00:45:45,906
Her ankles and her calves

1112
00:45:45,973 --> 00:45:47,741
are the same width.

1113
00:45:47,808 --> 00:45:49,727
And I'm sorry, but look at me.

1114
00:45:49,752 --> 00:45:53,147
I am the same size now
that I was at my wedding.

1115
00:45:53,172 --> 00:45:54,882
And come on, who
wouldn't want to come home

1116
00:45:54,948 --> 00:45:56,550
to this every night?

1117
00:45:57,148 --> 00:45:58,186
Okay. All right.

1118
00:45:58,252 --> 00:45:59,820
Maybe today's not the best day to judge.

1119
00:45:59,845 --> 00:46:02,048
I've been crying, and
my face is all puffy,

1120
00:46:02,073 --> 00:46:03,975
and just... just...

1121
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,335
Ignore my head. Now, from here down,

1122
00:46:06,360 --> 00:46:09,093
who wouldn't want to come home to this?

1123
00:46:09,464 --> 00:46:10,964
Actually, I'm a little
bloated right now.

1124
00:46:11,031 --> 00:46:13,572
I drank a lot of wine, and
my stomach is sort of...

1125
00:46:13,597 --> 00:46:15,137
Oh, can... can I borrow that?

1126
00:46:15,203 --> 00:46:16,710
Thank you.

1127
00:46:17,138 --> 00:46:19,607
Okay. Ignore this, ignore this.

1128
00:46:19,795 --> 00:46:23,544
But imagine coming home
to these every night.

1129
00:46:23,611 --> 00:46:24,745
Whoo!

1130
00:46:24,812 --> 00:46:25,941
Yeah.

1131
00:46:25,966 --> 00:46:28,018
Yeah, they're pretty good, right?

1132
00:46:28,382 --> 00:46:31,481
Plus they're standing up on their own.

1133
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:33,027
[gasping]

1134
00:46:34,941 --> 00:46:36,190
- Shit.
- Seriously,

1135
00:46:36,257 --> 00:46:38,392
there's no fucking way

1136
00:46:38,459 --> 00:46:40,196
that Penny Pan...

1137
00:46:40,221 --> 00:46:42,643
can compete with these tits!

1138
00:46:42,962 --> 00:46:45,099
So what if you're never going
to be a stand-up comedian.

1139
00:46:45,166 --> 00:46:46,798
Look at what greets you at the door.

1140
00:46:46,823 --> 00:46:48,302
- Shit.
- Get down from there right now.

1141
00:46:48,327 --> 00:46:50,596
You think Bob Newhart's
got a set of these at home?

1142
00:46:50,704 --> 00:46:52,440
Rickles, maybe.

1143
00:46:52,465 --> 00:46:54,000
- [audience shouts]
- Aah! Hey!

1144
00:46:54,108 --> 00:46:55,176
Let's go.

1145
00:46:55,243 --> 00:46:56,244
[audience cheering]

1146
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:58,646
- Hey, fuck Penny Pan!
- Bravo!

1147
00:47:00,060 --> 00:47:01,382
This is not what you think.

1148
00:47:01,449 --> 00:47:03,717
She's a housewife. She
doesn't know the rules.

1149
00:47:03,784 --> 00:47:05,486
Yeah, yeah. We can
discuss it at the station.

1150
00:47:05,553 --> 00:47:07,121
- Station? What station?
- Come on. Let's go!

1151
00:47:07,188 --> 00:47:08,622
Come back next week!

1152
00:47:08,689 --> 00:47:10,090
I don't understand what's going on.

1153
00:47:10,158 --> 00:47:11,225
You're under arrest.

1154
00:47:11,292 --> 00:47:13,294
- What? Why?
- Public indecency

1155
00:47:13,361 --> 00:47:15,083
and performing without
a cabaret license.

1156
00:47:15,108 --> 00:47:16,906
You need a license
to do that? Seriously?

1157
00:47:16,931 --> 00:47:18,266
Yeah, yeah. You can bitch all about it

1158
00:47:18,291 --> 00:47:19,483
to your friend in the back seat there.

1159
00:47:19,508 --> 00:47:20,542
- Go ahead.
- Get in there.

1160
00:47:20,567 --> 00:47:22,937
Hey! Hey! Hey!

1161
00:47:26,440 --> 00:47:27,540
Hey.

1162
00:47:28,032 --> 00:47:29,240
Hi.

1163
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,952
Here you go.

1164
00:47:38,245 --> 00:47:39,384
Thanks, Judy.

1165
00:47:40,117 --> 00:47:41,628
You bailed me out?

1166
00:47:41,653 --> 00:47:43,056
My good deed for the year.

1167
00:47:43,123 --> 00:47:44,596
You get chick raped?

1168
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:46,093
I don't think so.

1169
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:47,928
- Here.
- It's still night out.

1170
00:47:47,995 --> 00:47:49,096
Yep.

1171
00:47:49,163 --> 00:47:50,398
I feel different.

1172
00:47:50,464 --> 00:47:51,873
You were in there for 20 minutes.

1173
00:47:51,898 --> 00:47:53,300
20 minutes can change you.

1174
00:47:53,325 --> 00:47:55,002
- Not really.
- I'm a con now.

1175
00:47:55,068 --> 00:47:56,937
- Not quite.
- I've got a rap sheet.

1176
00:47:57,004 --> 00:47:58,672
- No, you don't.
- I'm hard.

1177
00:47:58,739 --> 00:48:01,975
I'm a hard, used woman. Is my hair gray?

1178
00:48:02,042 --> 00:48:03,544
- No, it's not.
- It feels gray.

1179
00:48:03,611 --> 00:48:05,454
- Jesus Christ.
- I had it all.

1180
00:48:05,479 --> 00:48:07,415
I had everything I'd always wanted,

1181
00:48:07,481 --> 00:48:09,790
and now it's all falling apart.

1182
00:48:10,251 --> 00:48:12,523
Okay. Come on.

1186
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,354
Look at all the people.

1187
00:48:22,396 --> 00:48:24,508
They look so happy. Are they high?

1188
00:48:24,533 --> 00:48:25,766
Yes, they are.

1189
00:48:25,834 --> 00:48:26,905
Must be nice.

1190
00:48:26,930 --> 00:48:28,747
Oh, God, I'm so tired.

1191
00:48:28,772 --> 00:48:30,304
I don't think I've ever been so tired.

1192
00:48:30,371 --> 00:48:32,040
Have some nuts.

1193
00:48:32,065 --> 00:48:34,377
Do you notice I'm not
wearing my own shoes?

1194
00:48:34,402 --> 00:48:36,877
I'm not. Don't know
what happened, either.

1195
00:48:36,944 --> 00:48:40,281
Now I'm just a single,
gray-haired ex-con

1196
00:48:40,348 --> 00:48:41,815
drinking hooch and eating old nuts

1197
00:48:41,882 --> 00:48:43,251
in someone else's shoes.

1198
00:48:43,317 --> 00:48:45,697
Listen, if you're still upset
about your husband, don't be.

1199
00:48:45,722 --> 00:48:47,149
The guy was a fraud and a loser.

1200
00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:48,223
You don't know him.

1201
00:48:48,248 --> 00:48:50,001
I know he was doing Bob Newhart's act.

1202
00:48:50,026 --> 00:48:51,941
Everybody steals, right?

1203
00:48:51,966 --> 00:48:53,201
You didn't.

1204
00:48:53,602 --> 00:48:54,762
I didn't what?

1205
00:48:54,828 --> 00:48:56,230
House party tonight.

1206
00:48:56,297 --> 00:48:57,614
Steal. You didn't steal.

1207
00:48:57,639 --> 00:48:59,098
Your shit was totally original.

1208
00:48:59,123 --> 00:49:00,402
Don't get me wrong. It was rough,

1209
00:49:00,461 --> 00:49:02,069
but I'm telling you, there
is definitely something there.

1210
00:49:02,094 --> 00:49:03,729
I'm thinking maybe
we can meet somewhere,

1211
00:49:03,754 --> 00:49:05,806
bigger club, if I could
just get Baz to die.

1212
00:49:05,873 --> 00:49:08,618
- What are you talking about?
- About your act.

1213
00:49:08,643 --> 00:49:09,855
I don't have an act.

1214
00:49:09,880 --> 00:49:11,848
You will when we're done.

1215
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:13,283
I don't understand.

1216
00:49:13,349 --> 00:49:16,371
You should do standup,
and I can help you.

1217
00:49:17,067 --> 00:49:18,861
- Oh, come on.
- I'm serious.

1218
00:49:18,886 --> 00:49:21,457
- I am a mother.
- Great. We'll use that.

1219
00:49:21,531 --> 00:49:22,732
One of your kids do something weird?

1220
00:49:22,799 --> 00:49:24,501
Tonight was an isolated incident.

1221
00:49:24,568 --> 00:49:25,969
There are medications I can take

1222
00:49:26,035 --> 00:49:27,904
to make sure that never happens again.

1223
00:49:28,805 --> 00:49:29,905
