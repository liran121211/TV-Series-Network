Beautiful printing.

36
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,014
I've got a pretty mean cursive, too.

37
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,767
Brearley and Bryn Mawr, I have no doubt.

38
00:01:43,773 --> 00:01:45,394
So, you're prepping for Christmas?

39
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,735
The display department
always likes to get a nice jump.

40
00:01:47,742 --> 00:01:50,190
Never too early to scout for Santas.

41
00:01:50,196 --> 00:01:51,858
Lots of jolly choices out there.

42
00:01:51,864 --> 00:01:53,735
Oh, we screen them fresh every year.

43
00:01:53,741 --> 00:01:56,738
Make sure they're still plump,
still personable, still sober.

44
00:01:56,744 --> 00:01:58,532
So much to think about.

45
00:01:58,538 --> 00:02:00,033
So, you majored in Russian Literature.

46
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:01,899
With a minor in Education.
For a split second,

47
00:02:01,906 --> 00:02:03,755
I thought about being
a grammar school teacher.

48
00:02:03,762 --> 00:02:06,456
- What happened?
- I met some grammar school kids.

49
00:02:06,462 --> 00:02:07,874
(MIDGE CHUCKLES)

50
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,763
No, seriously, I married
straight out of college

51
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:11,837
and had children of my own.
Two, actually.

52
00:02:11,843 --> 00:02:13,687
Started my own grammar school,
if you will.

53
00:02:13,694 --> 00:02:15,841
And you're here for our
elevator operator position?

54
00:02:15,847 --> 00:02:16,889
Yes, sir.

55
00:02:16,896 --> 00:02:19,261
We usually hire men for that job.

56
00:02:19,267 --> 00:02:21,346
Oh. The ad didn't say.

57
00:02:21,352 --> 00:02:22,848
I just think that our lady shoppers

58
00:02:22,854 --> 00:02:25,142
- prefer men in the position.
- I get that.

59
00:02:25,148 --> 00:02:26,727
Not a lot of practical work experience

60
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:27,769
on your résumé, either.

61
00:02:27,775 --> 00:02:29,611
But lots of volunteer work.

62
00:02:29,618 --> 00:02:31,405
It's all listed there.
I was a candy striper.

63
00:02:31,412 --> 00:02:33,004
And in high school, I helped raise money

64
00:02:33,011 --> 00:02:35,525
to start a gymnastics program,
the Zion Orphanage in Jerusalem.

65
00:02:35,532 --> 00:02:37,529
- Raised $700.
- Impressive.

66
00:02:37,535 --> 00:02:40,115
Lots of little Jews
tumbling around because of me.

67
00:02:40,121 --> 00:02:42,159
Mrs. Maisel, you are
a very delightful woman,

68
00:02:42,165 --> 00:02:44,828
but I'm not sure that being
an elevator operator

69
00:02:44,834 --> 00:02:47,247
is the right fit for you. I'm sorry.

70
00:02:47,253 --> 00:02:49,124
Oh, but I-I have such a passion for it.

71
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,001
I grew up with one in my building,

72
00:02:51,007 --> 00:02:52,404
my sweet Jerry,

73
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:53,990
So, in a way, I feel as if my whole life

74
00:02:53,997 --> 00:02:56,303
- has been leading up to this.
- Your whole life?

75
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:58,292
And I really hit it off
with Darren on the way up.

76
00:02:58,299 --> 00:02:59,593
Lots of informative shoptalk.

77
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:00,761
Darren is very personable.

78
00:03:00,767 --> 00:03:02,679
And the uniform. Picture me in that hat

79
00:03:02,685 --> 00:03:04,723
and the coat with a tapered
waist. I mean, come on.

80
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:06,808
Thank you for coming in.

81
00:03:06,814 --> 00:03:09,853

82
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:11,361

Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas!

WOMAN: I just go through periods
where nothing looks good.

87
00:03:28,868 --> 00:03:30,207
WOMAN 2: Well, that's not true
and you know it.

88
00:03:30,213 --> 00:03:31,927
WOMAN 1: I guess I can
just stick with red.

89
00:03:31,934 --> 00:03:33,126
Can't go too wrong there.

90
00:03:33,132 --> 00:03:34,878
WOMAN 2: Well, you could try
a dark pink lipstick, too.

91
00:03:34,884 --> 00:03:37,390
That might work better with the
pink you picked for your rouge.

92
00:03:37,397 --> 00:03:39,520
Oh, please. I just worked up
the courage to wear red

93
00:03:39,527 --> 00:03:41,801
in a vain attempt to look
like Leslie Caron in Gigi.

94
00:03:41,808 --> 00:03:43,512
- Oh.
- Red works great with pink.

95
00:03:43,518 --> 00:03:44,930
Pardon me?

96
00:03:44,936 --> 00:03:47,106
And it's terrific with your complexion.

97
00:03:47,113 --> 00:03:49,474
You have some natural rosiness.
Just be sure to pick a tone

98
00:03:49,481 --> 00:03:50,852
that doesn't augment that too much.

99
00:03:50,858 --> 00:03:52,979
- Keep it subtle.
- I like subtle.

100
00:03:52,985 --> 00:03:54,690
That's Raven Red.

101
00:03:54,696 --> 00:03:55,857
Try Cherries in the Snow.

102
00:03:55,863 --> 00:03:57,150
That'll get you close to Caron.

103
00:03:57,156 --> 00:03:58,527
Oh, I like that.

104
00:03:58,533 --> 00:04:00,195
- (LAUGHING): A lot.
- I do, too.

105
00:04:00,201 --> 00:04:01,822
You're a dream. Both of you.

106
00:04:01,828 --> 00:04:04,700
Thank you. Give me three of these.

107
00:04:04,706 --> 00:04:06,868
I'll meet you down at
the register, Mrs. Stapleton.

108
00:04:06,874 --> 00:04:08,751

- Really.

so go fuck yourself."

351
00:14:04,903 --> 00:14:07,024
You might want to soften that a little.

352
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:08,233
Yeah, but pretty cool, huh?

353
00:14:08,239 --> 00:14:10,194
"Susie Myerson's office."

354
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,529
"Susie Myerson and Associates."

355
00:14:12,535 --> 00:14:14,531
- What?
- Thinking big, right?

356
00:14:14,537 --> 00:14:16,158
Yeah. I'm thinking big.

357
00:14:16,164 --> 00:14:20,162
All right, thank you,
Ethan Carter and his combo!

358
00:14:20,168 --> 00:14:22,164
Well, that was almost palatable.

359
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:24,667
Now, get your stuff off and
we'll bring on the next act.

360
00:14:24,673 --> 00:14:26,210
(WHISTLES)

361
00:14:26,216 --> 00:14:29,046
Okay. It's gonna be a comedian.

362
00:14:29,052 --> 00:14:31,465
So hang tight, everybody,
and get ready to laugh.

363
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:32,966
You good to go?

364
00:14:32,972 --> 00:14:34,093
Oh, God, yeah.

365
00:14:34,099 --> 00:14:35,260
Started my new job today.

366
00:14:35,266 --> 00:14:36,845
It was crazy.

367
00:14:36,851 --> 00:14:40,307
So many stories. I hung out with
these young girls, cute as buttons.

368
00:14:40,313 --> 00:14:42,434
And the customers, they were hysterical.

369
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,853
Great. You want to run it by me?
A little, uh, practice run?

370
00:14:44,859 --> 00:14:46,355
Oh, no. I don't want to get stale.

371
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:47,690
So, "Miriam," right?

372
00:14:47,696 --> 00:14:50,484
Yes, but I'll be using a nom de plume.

373
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,807
- A nom de what?
- Nom de plume.

374
00:14:52,814 --> 00:14:54,780
- Sounds like a sex toy.
- Yeah, like it goes up

375
00:14:54,786 --> 00:14:56,949
- your ass or something.
- It's a fake name.

376
00:14:56,955 --> 00:14:58,409
I-I don't want to use my real name.

377
00:14:58,415 --> 00:14:59,910
Fine, then give me your fake name.

378
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,329
Well, now I can't think of one.

379
00:15:02,335 --> 00:15:04,331
Eh, F-Fanny, I guess.

380
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:05,624
And the last name?

381
00:15:05,630 --> 00:15:07,000
Brice.

382
00:15:07,006 --> 00:15:08,836
- "Fanny Brice"?
- That's taken.

383
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:10,421
Then Fanny Jones. Uh...

384
00:15:10,427 --> 00:15:12,047
Fanny Jone... that is a terrible name.

385
00:15:12,053 --> 00:15:13,717
Yeah, like you put zero thought into it.

386
00:15:13,724 --> 00:15:15,612
Jackie, please, just make up
a last name for me.

387
00:15:15,619 --> 00:15:18,156
- I'll come up with a permanent one.
- Okay.

388
00:15:18,163 --> 00:15:19,972
OKAY, I REPEAT: I like your real name.

389
00:15:19,978 --> 00:15:21,849
I don't want to use my real name.

390
00:15:21,855 --> 00:15:24,017
Hey, your call.

391
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,854
JACKIE: All right, give it up
for a very funny lady,

392
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:28,731
whose name you're gonna
want to remember.

393
00:15:28,737 --> 00:15:30,566
Fanny Midge.

394
00:15:30,572 --> 00:15:32,031
- (APPLAUSE)
- Come here.

395
00:15:33,158 --> 00:15:36,447
Thank you, everybody.

396
00:15:36,453 --> 00:15:39,575
That's very nice of you, seeing as
how I haven't done anything yet.

397
00:15:39,581 --> 00:15:40,784
(LAUGHTER)

398
00:15:41,664 --> 00:15:43,036
So.

399
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:44,913
I started work today.

400
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:46,123
A new job.

401
00:15:46,129 --> 00:15:48,751
And it was crazy.

402
00:15:48,757 --> 00:15:50,794
Super crazy.
I'm-I'm a makeup counter girl

403
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,505
at B. Altman.
Who here's been to B. Altman?

404
00:15:53,511 --> 00:15:55,132
No one?

405
00:15:55,138 --> 00:15:56,967
Really? Or is-is there
one person? I c...

406
00:15:56,973 --> 00:15:59,803
This spotlight is so bright,
I can't see a thing.

407
00:15:59,809 --> 00:16:01,555
Blinding. Eh, co...

408
00:16:01,561 --> 00:16:03,056
Maybe, just...

409
00:16:03,062 --> 00:16:04,808
(CHAIR SCRAPES ON FLOOR)

410
00:16:04,814 --> 00:16:07,153
Well, B. Altman is a department store.

411
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,937
But I think my favorite thing
I did today...

412
00:16:08,943 --> 00:16:10,397
And this is gonna sound weird...

413
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:14,401
Was punching in on the time clar...

414
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:15,736
"Time Clark."

415
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:17,070
What is wrong with my mouth?

416
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,281
- (SOFT LAUGHTER)
- "Time clock."

417
00:16:19,287 --> 00:16:22,910
Punching in was just kind of a real

418
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,119
powerful feeling, you know?

419
00:16:24,125 --> 00:16:26,455
You know, the-the feel of it.

420
00:16:26,461 --> 00:16:28,040
The sound of it.

421
00:16:28,046 --> 00:16:30,209
M-My interview for the job
was another thing.

422
00:16:30,215 --> 00:16:32,836
They were already getting ready
for Christmas.

423
00:16:32,842 --> 00:16:35,380
It's not even Halloween yet,
and I'm sitting in a hallway

424
00:16:35,386 --> 00:16:39,092
with a couple of dozen
fat fucking Santas.

425
00:16:39,098 --> 00:16:41,470
(LAUGHTER) -Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah. Picture that.

426
00:16:41,476 --> 00:16:45,474
Me, and a line of big, fat
fucking Santas, and you know,

427
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:49,353
some of these guys
are fucking fat, and...

428
00:16:49,359 --> 00:16:50,485
(GULPING SOUND)

429
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:53,440
They drink.

430
00:16:53,446 --> 00:16:54,733
They are tipplers.

431
00:16:54,739 --> 00:16:56,193
That's what Mr. Stanyon told me.

432
00:16:56,199 --> 00:16:57,986
"Keep them sober."

433
00:16:57,992 --> 00:17:00,030
That-that's actually
not Mr. Stanyon's voice,

434
00:17:00,036 --> 00:17:01,698
that's Mrs. O'Toole.

435
00:17:01,704 --> 00:17:04,117
"Doors are opening."

436
00:17:04,123 --> 00:17:07,627
That's what she says
when she's about to have sex.

437
00:17:09,087 --> 00:17:10,916

440
00:17:14,175 --> 00:17:16,547
fun girls at work, too.

441
00:17:16,553 --> 00:17:18,715
Uh, Mary, she's sweet.

with her Van Heflins

443

and William Holdens and...

444
00:17:25,436 --> 00:17:28,100
All right. You win.

445
00:17:28,106 --> 00:17:30,519
Uh, and then, there's Harriet.

446
00:17:30,525 --> 00:17:33,939
She's our Negro clerk.

447
00:17:33,945 --> 00:17:36,567
And beautiful, like, God,
this woman is beautiful.

448
00:17:36,573 --> 00:17:40,320
She's-she's Lena Horne,
she helps our Negro customers.

449
00:17:40,326 --> 00:17:41,530
Because she's a Negro.

450
00:17:41,536 --> 00:17:43,031
What?

451
00:17:43,037 --> 00:17:45,033
Harriet's a Negro. Where's this going?

452
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,244
It-it's not going anywhere.

453
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,289
- Obviously.
- (LAUGHTER)

454

This-this spotlight
is really fucking bright.

C-Can you dim that?

456
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:56,628
I mean, really, really,
it's bright as shit.

457
00:17:56,634 --> 00:18:00,340
Okay, well, now the audience
can't see me at all.

00:18:00,346 --> 00:18:02,467
- Doesn't matter.

Him you laugh at. All right.

461
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:08,932
Okay, just-just getting
the lay of the land here.

462
00:18:08,938 --> 00:18:10,142
You want to come up?

463
00:18:10,148 --> 00:18:11,351
Oh.

464
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:12,936
Yeah, didn't think so.

465
00:18:12,942 --> 00:18:15,439
Really? You're not-you're not
gonna turn the spotlight back on?

466
00:18:15,445 --> 00:18:17,858
Can't find the switch?

Uh, thanks, everybody.

471
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,207
It's been delightful.

472
00:18:30,835 --> 00:18:32,998
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
You still got more time.

473
00:18:33,004 --> 00:18:34,666
Well, give my time to someone else.

474
00:18:34,672 --> 00:18:36,835
This isn't fucking Congress.
Get back up there.

475
00:18:36,841 --> 00:18:40,219
No. And fix the fucking mic,
it won't come off the stand.

476
00:18:47,602 --> 00:18:49,890
Sorry about that, everyone.

477
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:52,851
Uh, we're gonna take a little
break to clear the stink.

What is wrong with these people?

482
00:18:59,238 --> 00:19:01,735
Absolutely nothing
is wrong with these people.

483
00:19:01,741 --> 00:19:05,280
Nothing? They're unconscious.
They're lying in state.

484
00:19:05,286 --> 00:19:06,685
And who is heckling me?

485
00:19:06,692 --> 00:19:08,490
There was another comic
up there an hour ago.

486
00:19:08,497 --> 00:19:09,576
He killed. Same audience.

487
00:19:09,582 --> 00:19:11,161
No. Uh-uh, no way.

488
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:13,258
You stunk tonight, lady.
That's all it was.

489
00:19:13,265 --> 00:19:15,757
No, Susie, this fucking audience
could hardly lift their heads

490
00:19:15,764 --> 00:19:18,077
- up off the table long enough...
- The audience was fine.

491
00:19:18,084 --> 00:19:19,711
You bombed. You took out Antwerp.

492
00:19:19,717 --> 00:19:21,259
- I bombed?
- People were asking

493
00:19:21,266 --> 00:19:23,799
for directions to a fallout shelter.
You bombed.

494
00:19:23,805 --> 00:19:26,843
- But I'm funny.
- Everybody bombs.

495
00:19:26,849 --> 00:19:29,262
But I've seen Rickles
five times. He's never bombed.

496
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:30,914
The guys go on Jack Paar,
they never bomb.

497
00:19:30,921 --> 00:19:32,808
Yeah, that's 'cause
they've spent years bombing

498
00:19:32,814 --> 00:19:35,015
and honing their act so
you don't have to see them bomb.

499
00:19:35,022 --> 00:19:37,549
- They've bombed, believe me.
- Well, I'm not gonna bomb again.

500
00:19:37,556 --> 00:19:39,838
No, you're gonna bomb again
and again and again and again.

501
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,901
Why would anyone do this
if they're just gonna bomb

502
00:19:41,908 --> 00:19:43,276
again and again and again?

503
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,903
Because it's part of the process.

504
00:19:44,909 --> 00:19:46,684
Yeah, well, it's not part of my process.

505
00:19:47,453 --> 00:19:49,574
Shit.

506
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,868
I've only done this drunk or stoned.

507
00:19:51,874 --> 00:19:53,847
What-what if that's
the only reason I was funny?

508
00:19:53,854 --> 00:19:56,021
Like, I can't get loaded
every time I come on stage.

509
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,290
You never met a comic?

510
00:19:57,296 --> 00:19:58,991
All right, here. Go smoke a cigarette.

511
00:19:58,998 --> 00:20:02,087
No, I'm not gonna go smoke a cigarette.
I feel devastated.

512
00:20:02,093 --> 00:20:03,630
I've never felt this devastated.

513
00:20:03,636 --> 00:20:05,924
You mean, besides
when your husband left you.

514
00:20:05,930 --> 00:20:08,218
- Give me a cigarette.
- Next time, prepare a little.

515
00:20:08,224 --> 00:20:09,975
Spontaneity works until it doesn't work.

516
00:20:09,982 --> 00:20:11,181
Then you're stuck.

517
00:20:11,188 --> 00:20:12,347
Prepare.

518
00:20:12,353 --> 00:20:14,474
All right.

519
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,898
Right.

520
00:20:20,278 --> 00:20:22,831
- Fuck.
- So we went to this cabdriver,

521
00:20:22,838 --> 00:20:24,846
and, uh, I don't want you
to think we're like that,

522
00:20:24,853 --> 00:20:27,117
you know, but you must remember
what men are like in war,

00:20:27,124 --> 00:20:28,488
it's that kind of a show tonight.

524
00:20:28,494 --> 00:20:30,907
So we went to this cabdriver,
and we said to him,

525
00:20:30,913 --> 00:20:32,367
"Where's the action?"

526
00:20:32,373 --> 00:20:35,037
This kind of masculine, sort of...
(LAUGHTER)

527
00:20:35,043 --> 00:20:40,125
So, so he took us to this place
where they fish illegally.

528
00:20:40,131 --> 00:20:42,133
- See, now you're not supposed...

Franz fucking Schubert!

you're not in your homes.

- Sorry, Sal.
- Sally. Sally, Sally.

- That's Latin.
- Is that so?

547
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,380
Sal, Sal, we sold plastic stuff

548
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:29,340
to people that don't actually
need plastic stuff.

549
00:21:29,347 --> 00:21:31,718
Yeah. See-see, that's what
salesmanship is, Sally.

00:21:31,724 --> 00:21:35,013
Mm-hmm. -Selling things
to people that they don't want.

551
00:21:35,019 --> 00:21:37,224
- It's kind of our calling.
- Two more.

- Then you go home.

Yeah, a certain young man
did send you some flowers.

564
00:22:01,546 --> 00:22:04,000
Guess he forgot to include a card.

571

- It offends my sensibilities.
- I don't pick the music.

Yeah, but you can pull the plug.
This song isn't bad.

Penny's young. Penny will learn.

She doesn't have anything
to be nervous about.

She's a sweet girl. Penny's great.

everyone loves Penny.

seeing The Music Man next week.

00:22:42,753 --> 00:22:44,374
I got friends in high places.

You're the man.

You know, I scored four seats,

so I don't know, if you and
Imogene want to tag along...?

590
00:22:50,761 --> 00:22:53,295
Are you kidding? Imogene would
cancel surgery to see that show.

Yes, we will go.

You may have plans.

five minutes of material.

before you reach the eyebrow.

00:34:12,818 --> 00:34:14,522
Then stand up and make 'em laugh.

871
00:34:14,528 --> 00:34:17,085
Come on. Let's see what you got.

872
00:34:17,092 --> 00:34:19,515
- What? You leave your balls at home?
- AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Oh!

873
00:34:19,522 --> 00:34:22,154
- (AUDIENCE MURMURING)
- Fine.

874
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:25,658
Um, a Spanish magician
tells the audience

875
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,743
he'll disappear on the count of three.

876
00:34:27,749 --> 00:34:31,622
He says, "Uno, dos." Poof.

877
00:34:31,628 --> 00:34:33,374
He disappeared without a tres.

878
00:34:33,380 --> 00:34:36,002
(LAUGHTER)

879
00:34:36,008 --> 00:34:38,385
(LAUGHTER, CHEERING)

880
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:43,891
I quit.

881
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:48,180
Why doesn't this stupid place
have a backstage?

882
00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:49,599
Are you trying to humiliate me?

883
00:34:49,605 --> 00:34:51,767
You're doing a great job
all by yourself.

884
00:34:51,773 --> 00:34:53,477
- What the fuck?
- Don't.

885
00:34:53,483 --> 00:34:55,146
I mean, what the fuck?

886
00:34:55,152 --> 00:34:57,148
I just want to get the hell out of here.

887
00:34:57,154 --> 00:34:58,566
This isn't even your writing.

888
00:34:58,572 --> 00:34:59,984
Hi, Midge.

889
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,903
What are you doing here?

890
00:35:01,909 --> 00:35:03,529
I came to catch your set.

891
00:35:03,535 --> 00:35:04,989
Nice job.

892
00:35:04,995 --> 00:35:07,241
Nice job? Were you listening?

893
00:35:07,247 --> 00:35:09,076
The whole time.

894
00:35:09,082 --> 00:35:11,621
You got some good laughs
in the back there.

895
00:35:11,627 --> 00:35:13,915
How far back were you, Cafe Wha?

896
00:35:13,921 --> 00:35:15,875
Okay, I'm just trying to catch up here.

897
00:35:15,881 --> 00:35:18,711
- How do you know Herb Smith?
- She answered my ad

898
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:21,213
in the Hollywood Reporter. Hi, Susie.

899
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:24,050
You hired the Stage Deli
bottom-feeder to write your act?

900
00:35:24,056 --> 00:35:26,218
All based on her notebook.

901
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:27,678
Lot of good stuff in there.

902
00:35:27,684 --> 00:35:29,555
Nothing from these cards
came from my notebook.

903
00:35:29,561 --> 00:35:32,975
Yeah, because he sells the same crappy
jokes to everyone who hires him.

904
00:35:32,981 --> 00:35:35,269
- He's a fuckin' recycler!
- Didn't say that in the ad.

905
00:35:35,275 --> 00:35:38,105
That would have been
a dumb thing to put in the ad.

906
00:35:38,111 --> 00:35:40,524
I told you it'd be hit-and-miss!

907
00:35:40,530 --> 00:35:42,985
It was all miss, Herb. Nothing hit!

908
00:35:42,991 --> 00:35:45,112
Please tell me you did not pay this guy.

909
00:35:45,118 --> 00:35:47,323
- Oh, I paid him.
- Without consulting me?

910
00:35:47,329 --> 00:35:49,533
Hey, Midge, one thought?

911
00:35:49,539 --> 00:35:50,952
Oh, he's got a thought.

912
00:35:50,958 --> 00:35:52,578
The husband joke.

913
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:54,830
When you hit him over the head
with the frying pan,

914
00:35:54,836 --> 00:35:56,624
it's not "doink."

915
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:59,460
It's... "Doy-yoy-yoy-yoy-yoink!"

916
00:35:59,466 --> 00:36:02,546
Herb, the thing I'm gonna
hit you over the head with,

917
00:36:02,552 --> 00:36:06,968
your screams are gonna drown out
the doy-yoy-yoy-yoy-yoy-yoink!

918
00:36:06,974 --> 00:36:09,142
We got to talk. Good-bye, Herb.

919
00:36:10,936 --> 00:36:12,139
SUSIE: Herb Smith.

920
00:36:12,145 --> 00:36:13,933
- Really?
- I needed help.

921
00:36:13,939 --> 00:36:15,810
So you hire a guy
that'll work for salami?

922
00:36:15,816 --> 00:36:17,144
I didn't want to bomb again.

923
00:36:17,150 --> 00:36:18,654
- Oh, mission accomplished.
- Ha, ha.

924
00:36:18,661 --> 00:36:21,315
Geez. If I wanted an act like that,
I'd have booked your husband.

925
00:36:21,321 --> 00:36:23,693
Real nice. -I thought
we were doing this together.

926
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:26,113
- Are we not doing this together?
- I'm here, aren't I?

927
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:28,122
You go behind my back,
you hire a guy to help you.

928
00:36:28,129 --> 00:36:29,824
I'm here to help you.

929
00:36:29,830 --> 00:36:32,630
How? By rushing me onstage
when I wasn't even ready?

930
00:36:32,637 --> 00:36:34,895
- What are you talking about?
- I hardly stepped in the door

931
00:36:34,902 --> 00:36:36,247
and you were pushing me to go on.

932
00:36:36,253 --> 00:36:38,708
I wanted you to have a good audience.
Great job.

933
00:36:38,714 --> 00:36:39,917
- So it's my fault.
- Yes.

934
00:36:39,923 --> 00:36:41,460
- Hey, fuck you.
- No, fuck you.

935
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:43,170
What is wrong with you?

936
00:36:43,176 --> 00:36:44,547
I can't do this anymore.

937
00:36:44,553 --> 00:36:45,756
- Don't.
- I can't do it.

938
00:36:45,762 --> 00:36:46,841
I-I don't want to do it.

939
00:36:46,847 --> 00:36:48,592
We've talked about bombing.

940
00:36:48,598 --> 00:36:50,720
So you get up on stage and bomb.
See how you like it.

941
00:36:50,726 --> 00:36:52,513
- I'd hate it.
- Well, there you go.

942
00:36:52,519 --> 00:36:54,432
But I'm not a comedian.
You're the comedian.

943
00:36:54,438 --> 00:36:56,058
- Not anymore.
- Bullshit.

944
00:36:56,064 --> 00:36:58,519
- Not anymore.
- Oh. Again?

945
00:36:58,525 --> 00:37:00,187
Okay, fine. So you're not gonna do this?

946
00:37:00,193 --> 00:37:01,272
- Nope.
- You're giving up?

947
00:37:01,278 --> 00:37:02,356
Yeah.

948
00:37:02,362 --> 00:37:03,983
Fine.

949
00:37:03,989 --> 00:37:05,526
Go get your purse.

950
00:37:05,532 --> 00:37:07,111
Go on home.

951
00:37:07,117 --> 00:37:08,988
But this is good-bye, Miriam.

952
00:37:08,994 --> 00:37:11,824
Or Sadie, or Cuntsy Lou Who
or whatever your name is.

953
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:13,367
Because that's all you and I are.

954
00:37:13,373 --> 00:37:15,327
Professional relationship.
Not girlfriends.

955
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,204
- I know that.
- And if there's no profession,

956
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:19,623
there's no relationship, capisce?

957
00:37:19,629 --> 00:37:21,042
Good-bye.

958
00:37:21,048 --> 00:37:22,501
Uh, don't forget your comedy cards.

959
00:37:22,507 --> 00:37:24,128
You paid good money for them.

960
00:37:24,134 --> 00:37:27,298
Don't forget to cancel that phone
you ordered. Unless it's too late.

961
00:37:27,304 --> 00:37:29,592
Oh, don't worry.
I didn't order the stupid phone.

962
00:37:29,598 --> 00:37:31,802
Maybe I can instinctively smell a loser!

963
00:37:31,808 --> 00:37:33,351
Fine!

964
00:37:35,103 --> 00:37:37,308
MOISHE: So the priest turns
to the nun and says,

965
00:37:37,314 --> 00:37:39,111
"Excuse me, are you staring at me?"

966
00:37:39,118 --> 00:37:41,130
- Is this a dirty joke?
- Would I tell a dirty joke

967
00:37:41,137 --> 00:37:42,404
- in mixed company?
- Yes. -Yes.

968
00:37:42,411 --> 00:37:44,101
- It's not a dirty joke.
- Eat that, honey.

969
00:37:44,108 --> 00:37:45,483
Eat it so that I won't.

970
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:47,384
- (LAUGHS)
- So, the nun says to the priest,

971
00:37:47,391 --> 00:37:49,653
"I remember you.
We met once at the Vatican."

972
00:37:49,659 --> 00:37:51,739
- This is a dirty joke.
- Not a dirty joke.

973
00:37:51,745 --> 00:37:54,033
And so, the priest says,
"The Vatican's full

974
00:37:54,039 --> 00:37:56,619
"of a lot of priests, all in
robes who look just like me.

975
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:58,287
How do you know that was me?"

976
00:37:58,293 --> 00:38:00,831
And the nun says...

977
00:38:00,837 --> 00:38:02,249
This is a dirty joke.

978
00:38:02,255 --> 00:38:04,001
- (LAUGHS) -SHIRLEY: I knew it.
- So did I.

979
00:38:04,007 --> 00:38:06,045
All right. I'll resume
smelling my dessert wine

980
00:38:06,051 --> 00:38:08,395
and acting like I know
what the hell I'm talking about.

981
00:38:08,402 --> 00:38:10,424
Excuse me, everyone,
I'm going to go freshen up.

982
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:12,134
- Because you're stale?
- (LAUGHS)

983
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:14,178
I'll come with you,
because I am definitely stale.

984
00:38:14,184 --> 00:38:16,222
- (LAUGHS)
- You're gorgeous, too, Shirl.

985
00:38:16,228 --> 00:38:18,224
SHIRLEY: You're killing m
with that tiny tush.

986
00:38:18,230 --> 00:38:20,107
PENNY: Oh, Mrs. Maisel...

987
00:38:22,567 --> 00:38:25,189
- No.
- What?

988
00:38:25,195 --> 00:38:27,082
Her. No. -What the hell
are you talking about?

989
00:38:27,089 --> 00:38:28,450
You know what I'm talking about.

990
00:38:28,457 --> 00:38:30,193
How would I know
what you're talking about?

991
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,780
She's young, she's emptyheaded,
she doesn't eat. She's a shiksa.

992
00:38:32,786 --> 00:38:34,681
- So?
- Shiksas are for practice.

993
00:38:34,688 --> 00:38:36,075
Want to say that a little louder?

994
00:38:36,082 --> 00:38:38,325
- I think you heard me just fine.
- I don't believe this.

995
00:38:38,332 --> 00:38:40,614
- Don't act like a child.
- You can't judge her like this.

996
00:38:40,621 --> 00:38:42,913
- You don't even know her.
- I know enough. That is a girl

997
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,751
that you have on the side, Joel.
It's not a girl you marry.

998
00:38:45,757 --> 00:38:47,947
You don't introduce her
to your fucking parents.

999
00:38:47,954 --> 00:38:49,338
I had Yankees tickets tonight.

1000
00:38:49,344 --> 00:38:51,022
She's a good girl. Sweet.

1001
00:38:51,029 --> 00:38:53,833
- "Sweet." Good. Sounds like a Danish.
- You'd hate her no matter what.

1002
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,241
Yeah. Convince yourself
of that and then we'll talk.

1003
00:38:57,666 --> 00:38:58,890
No.

1004
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,017
I'm eating her dessert.

1005
00:39:02,023 --> 00:39:03,144
MOISHE: Oh, there she is.

1006
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:05,146
I stole... I stole your dessert.

1007
00:39:05,152 --> 00:39:06,397
That's okay, Mrs. Maisel.

1008
00:39:06,403 --> 00:39:07,815
Oh, call me Shirley.

1009
00:39:07,821 --> 00:39:09,400
- Oh.
- MOISHE: I've got another joke.

1010
00:39:09,406 --> 00:39:11,652
- It's gonna be dirty again.
- It's not gonna be dirty.

1011
00:39:11,658 --> 00:39:13,834
So, a clown walks into a laundromat.

1012
00:39:13,841 --> 00:39:15,170
This is dirty.

1013
00:39:15,177 --> 00:39:16,741
MOISHE: There's nothing dirty about it.

1014
00:39:16,748 --> 00:39:18,367
SHIRLEY:
He told this joke five years ago

1015
00:39:18,373 --> 00:39:19,869
in front of the rabbi.

1016
00:39:19,875 --> 00:39:21,623
MOISHE: Wait, is this
the dirty temple joke?

1017
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:23,108
SHIRLEY: It's the dirty temple joke.

1018
00:39:23,115 --> 00:39:24,354
MOISHE: Are you sure?

1019
00:39:24,361 --> 00:39:26,230
SHIRLEY: It ends with
cabbage up the chimney.

1020
00:39:26,237 --> 00:39:28,598
MOISHE: You're right, it's too
dirty. Funny, but too dirty.

1021
00:39:28,605 --> 00:39:30,697
- Okay. Knock, knock.
