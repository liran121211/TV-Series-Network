My daughter said I should try more.

177
00:06:20,577 --> 00:06:22,956
She says I should live a little
before it's all over.

178
00:06:22,981 --> 00:06:24,088
Before what's all over?

179
00:06:24,113 --> 00:06:26,555
My life. She said it's a failure.

180
00:06:26,755 --> 00:06:30,185
I don't participate; that's why
my husband won't talk to me.

181
00:06:30,254 --> 00:06:32,670
She's been very outspoken
since she went to Radcliffe.

182
00:06:32,723 --> 00:06:33,974
- [SUSIE SIGHS]
- There.

183
00:06:34,022 --> 00:06:36,066
What do you think?

184
00:06:36,301 --> 00:06:37,845
I don't know.

185
00:06:37,886 --> 00:06:39,686
Excuse me, is that Mermaid Ice?

186
00:06:39,725 --> 00:06:41,990
I'm sorry, I'm in a big hurry.
My man's coming over

187
00:06:42,015 --> 00:06:44,002
and I am all out
of my Mermaid Ice eye shadow.

188
00:06:44,027 --> 00:06:45,631
And if I am not wearing that
when he gets home,

189
00:06:45,656 --> 00:06:46,758
all hell breaks loose.

190
00:06:46,799 --> 00:06:48,150
- Really?
- You kidding?

191
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:49,653
I couldn't get him
to give me the time of day,

192
00:06:49,678 --> 00:06:51,874
much less give me the,
you know, time of day.

193
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:53,038
And then I came in here...

194
00:06:53,063 --> 00:06:54,373
- you remember when I came in here?
- I do.

195
00:06:54,398 --> 00:06:55,842
You came in here and we talked about...

196
00:06:55,867 --> 00:06:58,549
I told you my life was crap,
you sold me the Mermaid Ice,

197
00:06:58,574 --> 00:07:01,118
and now my life is a fat, fuzzy peach.

198
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:03,470
I mean, I-I'm going broke 'cause
this stuff costs a fortune,

199
00:07:03,495 --> 00:07:04,961
but, man, is it worth it.

200
00:07:04,997 --> 00:07:06,696
- Well, my goodness.
- Yeah.

201
00:07:06,721 --> 00:07:08,660
If it worked for you...

202
00:07:08,973 --> 00:07:11,061
- I'll take two.
- Wonderful.

203
00:07:11,086 --> 00:07:12,546
You will not be sorry.

204
00:07:12,588 --> 00:07:14,348
Margo, would you mind
ringing up Mrs. Winters

205
00:07:14,372 --> 00:07:16,508
while I help my return customer
over here?

206
00:07:17,024 --> 00:07:19,553
MARGO: Hello,
I can help you right here.

207
00:07:19,595 --> 00:07:21,055
Well, well, well.

208
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:22,776
Just call me the closer.

209
00:07:23,335 --> 00:07:24,775
I'm a little surprised to see you.

210
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,919
Well, it's been a while
and last time we...

211
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:29,946
words were said and...

212
00:07:32,617 --> 00:07:34,037
So, you're sorry?

213
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:36,081
- Sure.
- Good.

214
00:07:36,123 --> 00:07:37,458
It's behind us.

215
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:38,964
So, this is where you hang out now?

216
00:07:38,989 --> 00:07:40,144
Well, you know I never
like to be more than

217
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:41,369
three feet from a lipstick.

218
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,420
I do.

219
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:43,842
It's a good job. The
girls are really nice.

220
00:07:43,867 --> 00:07:45,369
And there's a vending machine
in the employee break room

221
00:07:45,394 --> 00:07:47,971
that's broken, so if you hit it
just right, free Abba-Zabas.

222
00:07:47,996 --> 00:07:50,158
- Mm, you are living the dream.
- Sorry to interrupt.

223
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,115
Midge, my parents
are making me throw them

224
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:53,893
a 25th anniversary party Friday.

225
00:07:53,918 --> 00:07:55,857
- Friday? Short notice.
- I know.

226
00:07:55,882 --> 00:07:58,203
And I have no idea what people
of their age do at parties.

227
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,036
My mom keeps saying the word canapés.

228
00:08:00,061 --> 00:08:01,261
Is that an old people's dance?

229
00:08:01,405 --> 00:08:02,757
It's a type of hors d'oeuvre.

230
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,975
You always know everything,
so any tips would help.

231
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,121
Hire help.

232
00:08:06,146 --> 00:08:08,188
- And get chairs, lots of chairs.
- Right.

233
00:08:08,213 --> 00:08:10,117
- Old people sit.
- MIDGE: And invite some of your friends

234
00:08:10,142 --> 00:08:11,417
for a little moral support.

235
00:08:11,442 --> 00:08:13,602
Who the hell would want to come
to something like this?

236
00:08:13,967 --> 00:08:15,958
- I'll come.
- You will?

237
00:08:16,004 --> 00:08:17,366
Oh, my God, I love you.

238
00:08:17,395 --> 00:08:19,230
I love her.

239
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:21,084
Ha.

240
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,970
- Booked a gig.
- I'm sorry, what?

241
00:08:22,995 --> 00:08:24,586
It's just this thing
that I've been doing lately.

242
00:08:24,611 --> 00:08:25,883
I've been working the party circuit.

243
00:08:25,908 --> 00:08:28,820
- Which means...?
- I go to parties and I talk.

244
00:08:28,998 --> 00:08:31,211
- As opposed to...?
- People like to hear me talk.

245
00:08:31,236 --> 00:08:33,605
And so far, it's been young
parties, Viv's age.

246
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:35,085
I haven't really worked
an older crowd yet,

247
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:36,309
so this is a perfect opportunity.

248
00:08:36,334 --> 00:08:38,294
I'll-I'll have to adjust
a few of my references,

249
00:08:38,319 --> 00:08:40,407
but you have to be able
to read an audience, right?

250
00:08:40,434 --> 00:08:41,574
Uh-huh.

251
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,706
Uh, hey, are there large
quantities of narcotics

252
00:08:43,793 --> 00:08:45,008
in these Abba-Zabas of yours?

253
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:46,113
I can't explain. I...

254
00:08:46,138 --> 00:08:47,941
Just-just come and you'll see. Friday.

255
00:08:48,031 --> 00:08:50,576
- Oh, I can't. I have plans.
- What plans?

256
00:08:50,601 --> 00:08:53,965
Uh, to not be bored or miserable
at some old fuck's party.

257
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,534
Come. You'll-you'll watch,
you'll see, you'll understand.

258
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:57,729
I'll-I'll call you with the address.

259
00:08:57,754 --> 00:08:59,194
Wear something... clean.

260
00:09:06,464 --> 00:09:08,072
ABE: All right, everybody.

261
00:09:08,097 --> 00:09:09,383
Time's up.

262
00:09:09,424 --> 00:09:10,902
Put your papers on my desk

263
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:13,262
if they contain the correct answers,

264
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:16,241
otherwise, just don't.

265
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:18,850
- Abe.
- Oh, hello, Irving.

266
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:21,489
- What's up?
- I want you to meet Charles Connelly,

267
00:09:21,514 --> 00:09:23,811
Executive Recruiter from Bell Labs.

268
00:09:23,836 --> 00:09:25,212
Bell Labs.

269
00:09:25,246 --> 00:09:26,581
You got time to talk?

270
00:09:26,749 --> 00:09:28,585
Uh, sure.

271
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:30,556
We're calling it Project Echo, Abe.

272
00:09:30,581 --> 00:09:32,874
A quantum leap in satellite technology.

273
00:09:32,899 --> 00:09:35,300
The commercial ramifications
of this could be huge.

274
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:36,831
Not to mention
its defense capabilities.

275
00:09:36,856 --> 00:09:39,276
IRVING: It would revolutionize
the communications industry.

276
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,980
CHARLES: And Bell Labs
is leading the pack.

277
00:09:41,005 --> 00:09:42,780
Abe, we're gathering
the best and the brightest

278
00:09:42,805 --> 00:09:44,042
to help us get there first.

279
00:09:44,084 --> 00:09:46,172
- May I stop you there?
- CHARLES: Of course.

280
00:09:46,197 --> 00:09:48,947
I want no part of Sputnik panic.

281
00:09:49,014 --> 00:09:50,398
This smacks of that.

282
00:09:50,423 --> 00:09:51,853
There's no panic, Abe.

283
00:09:51,878 --> 00:09:52,893
We're doing this right.

284
00:09:52,918 --> 00:09:54,303
We never rush R&D.

285
00:09:54,328 --> 00:09:55,568
Your colleague, Bill Chernik...

286
00:09:55,593 --> 00:09:57,433
Bill and Abe have known
each other a long time.

287
00:09:57,495 --> 00:09:58,854
Bill Chernik's a good man.

288
00:09:58,879 --> 00:10:00,440
CHARLES: He's been consulting
with us for a while.

289
00:10:00,479 --> 00:10:02,231
Ask him about us.
You'll like what you hear.

290
00:10:02,256 --> 00:10:03,924
There's no way this could work.

291
00:10:04,017 --> 00:10:05,894
My class load is so full.

292
00:10:05,919 --> 00:10:07,921
We can help with that.
Take things off your plate.

293
00:10:07,946 --> 00:10:09,995
No, I'm loath to do that.

294
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,620
CHARLES:
We'll work around your schedule.

295
00:10:11,822 --> 00:10:13,632
An applied mathematician of your skills

296
00:10:13,657 --> 00:10:15,242
is in high demand these days.

297
00:10:15,267 --> 00:10:17,102
- We need you.
- [CHUCKLES]

298
00:10:17,127 --> 00:10:18,879
I told you he'd be a tough sell.

299
00:10:18,904 --> 00:10:20,447
Which makes us want you more.

300
00:10:20,472 --> 00:10:21,656
Pending a security clearance,

301
00:10:21,681 --> 00:10:23,277
Bell Labs is at your beck and call.

302
00:10:23,302 --> 00:10:24,513
I need to get home.

303
00:10:24,538 --> 00:10:25,842
Let me walk with you.

304
00:10:25,905 --> 00:10:27,490
- [BELL TOLLS]
- Please think it over.

305
00:10:27,515 --> 00:10:29,517
Take some time.
And call with any questions.

306
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:31,478
- I doubt I'll have any.
- Call anyhow.

307
00:10:31,503 --> 00:10:33,129
I'll give you the pitch all over again.

308
00:10:33,504 --> 00:10:35,265
And thanks for your time.

309
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:37,179
See you Monday, Abe.

310
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:42,219
We're going out to dinner!

311
00:10:42,244 --> 00:10:43,370
ROSE: Abe?

312
00:10:44,032 --> 00:10:45,931
Rose, Rose, get in here.

313
00:10:45,956 --> 00:10:47,917
We are going out to dinner.

314
00:10:47,942 --> 00:10:50,744
Ruby Foo's, Le Pavillon, name it.

315
00:10:50,769 --> 00:10:53,062
Abe, slow down.
Why are we going out to dinner?

316
00:10:53,087 --> 00:10:54,554
Bell Labs, Rose.

317
00:10:54,579 --> 00:10:56,664
I got an offer to work at Bell Labs.

318
00:10:56,869 --> 00:10:58,737
- What?
- Bell Labs down in the village!

319
00:10:58,762 --> 00:11:00,181
Oh, my God, Abe!

320
00:11:00,206 --> 00:11:03,293
- [LAUGHING]
- Oh, oh.

321
00:11:03,596 --> 00:11:06,724
You should have seen me
with that recruiter.

322
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,793
I played it so cool.

323
00:11:09,086 --> 00:11:10,804
I kind of nodded like this,

324
00:11:10,829 --> 00:11:12,135
was shaking my head a little bit.

325
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,641
Very serious, very dubious.

326
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:16,293
- Oh, you can look extremely dubious.
- [LAUGHS]

327
00:11:16,318 --> 00:11:18,882
And he was eating
out of the palm of my hand.

328
00:11:18,907 --> 00:11:21,185
This is the big leagues, Rose.

329
00:11:21,210 --> 00:11:24,714
This... this is
the hotbed of invention.

330
00:11:24,739 --> 00:11:27,617
That TV that you all like so much,

331
00:11:27,896 --> 00:11:31,525
- courtesy of Bell Labs transistor work.
- No.

332
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:33,422
- ETHAN: Grandpa, I was watching that.
- Oh.

333
00:11:33,447 --> 00:11:37,768
Bardeen and Brattain and
Shockley won a Nobel for that.

334
00:11:37,793 --> 00:11:39,837
And now I am in their ranks.

335
00:11:40,013 --> 00:11:41,681
Where are we going for dinner?

336
00:11:41,706 --> 00:11:43,082
What about a dinner?

337
00:11:43,107 --> 00:11:45,080
We're going out. The whole family.

338
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:46,356
Call Noah and Astrid.

339
00:11:46,381 --> 00:11:49,000
He's got an offer from Bell Labs.

340
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,181
- Wow, Papa, congratulations.
- [LAUGHS]

341
00:11:51,206 --> 00:11:52,355
Thank you very much.

342
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,280
You've been obsessing on Bell Labs

343
00:11:54,305 --> 00:11:55,890
- for, like, 20 years now.
- Mm-hmm.

344
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:57,091
I haven't been obsessing on them.

345
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,342
My whole childhood, it was Bell
Labs this and Bell Labs that,

346
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:00,796
and, "My God, I'd give up pastrami"

347
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:02,030
for a job at Bell Labs."

348
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,366
[LAUGHS] I may have mentioned them.

349
00:12:03,391 --> 00:12:05,052
A-And once a year, we'd tour
the building? The outside,

350
00:12:05,077 --> 00:12:06,429
- because we weren't allowed in.
- You kids would play

351
00:12:06,454 --> 00:12:07,953
on the sidewalk while your
father would jump up and down,

352
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:09,356
- and try and peek in the windows.
- Yes.

353
00:12:09,381 --> 00:12:11,093
That may have happened once or twice.

354
00:12:11,334 --> 00:12:12,961
- [CHUCKLES]
- Is that my blouse?

355
00:12:13,055 --> 00:12:15,004
- Uh, yes, but it's not quite right.
- For what?

356
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:18,115
Okay, I-I'm talking about
very important things here,

357
00:12:18,158 --> 00:12:20,035
and you're talking about clothes.

358
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:23,439
I have to get dressed.
Congratulations, Papa.

359
00:12:23,856 --> 00:12:26,109
How often do I get a job at Bell Labs

360
00:12:26,149 --> 00:12:28,119
and no one wants to celebrate with me?

361
00:12:28,144 --> 00:12:31,383
Oh, Abe, my love, we will find
the perfect night to celebrate.

362
00:12:31,771 --> 00:12:33,273
With Noah and Astrid?

363
00:12:33,374 --> 00:12:34,541
Uh, they will be there.

364
00:12:34,597 --> 00:12:35,973
I mean, it's Bell Labs.

365
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,521
And we, we are all
so very proud of you.

366
00:12:38,546 --> 00:12:40,048
Mama, where's your green dress?

367
00:12:40,073 --> 00:12:41,184
At the cleaners.

368
00:12:41,209 --> 00:12:42,669
[WHISPERS]: Oh, shoot.

369
00:12:45,845 --> 00:12:47,972
I'm never sure about me and peach.

370
00:12:47,997 --> 00:12:50,625
Hmm. I am.

371
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:53,808
Here.

372
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:54,917
The Dior?

373
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:56,527
Oh, that's perfect.

374
00:12:57,493 --> 00:13:00,132
- So, you're going to another party.
- Hmm?

375
00:13:00,191 --> 00:13:02,512
That's the fourth one
this week, isn't it?

376
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,458
Four this week, three last week.

377
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,203
Which, of course,
means they've already seen

378
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,428
everything in my closet.

379
00:13:07,798 --> 00:13:09,150
Enter yours.

380
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:12,411
So, are these friends
of yours and Joel's?

381
00:13:12,828 --> 00:13:14,788
No. New friends.

382
00:13:14,813 --> 00:13:16,148
- Girls from work.
- Hmm.

383
00:13:16,173 --> 00:13:17,591
What do you think?

384
00:13:17,714 --> 00:13:19,841
Lovely, understated.

385
00:13:19,883 --> 00:13:21,446
- Understated?
- Mm-hmm.

386
00:13:21,713 --> 00:13:23,845
- Next.
- You don't want to be understated?

387
00:13:23,887 --> 00:13:25,138
MIDGE: I need to stand out.

388
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,556
ROSE: Well, you always stand out.

389
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,433
I need to stand out
in a very specific way.

390
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:29,810
Well, you could wear nothing.

391
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:31,436
That would get some sort of attention.

392
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:32,598
Don't I know it.

393
00:13:32,623 --> 00:13:33,624
Now, tell me about...

394
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:35,192
not until my funeral.

395
00:13:36,001 --> 00:13:39,778
So tell me, are there men
at these, uh, parties?

396
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,822
They aren't nun parties, Mama.

397
00:13:41,863 --> 00:13:43,966
Well, you know, a girl
standing alone at a party

398
00:13:43,991 --> 00:13:45,701
- says just one thing.
- What's that?

399
00:13:45,726 --> 00:13:47,483
- I'm prey. Hunt me.
- Perfect.

400
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,723
- Miriam.
- No, seriously,

401
00:13:48,748 --> 00:13:50,458
I was looking
for a catchphrase. That's it.

402
00:13:50,490 --> 00:13:52,050
You should wait to go to these parties.

403
00:13:52,075 --> 00:13:53,077
It's too soon.

404
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,716
I'll add some gloves to this.

405
00:13:54,743 --> 00:13:55,843
That should give it some zazz.

406
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:57,274
- Miriam...
- Thanks for the dress, Mama.

407

00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:10,441
- What are you doing here?
- What am I...?

409
00:14:10,466 --> 00:14:12,009
Y-You invited me to this stupid party.

410
00:14:12,043 --> 00:14:13,123
No, I mean on the elevator.

411
00:14:13,148 --> 00:14:14,374
You're not leaving, are you?

412
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,613
No, I've been riding this thing
up and down for an hour

413
00:14:16,638 --> 00:14:18,372
waiting for you to float in here

414
00:14:18,397 --> 00:14:19,914
on your golden fucking Icarus horse.

415
00:14:19,939 --> 00:14:21,699
You got a pretty loose concept
of time, lady.

416
00:14:21,724 --> 00:14:23,068
Cabs were scarce.

417
00:14:23,093 --> 00:14:24,791
Well, are you waiting
for an engraved invitation?

418
00:14:24,816 --> 00:14:26,148
Get in here.

419
00:14:28,567 --> 00:14:30,319
Got to know the building pretty well.

420

Old guy on six has cancer.

421
00:14:31,849 --> 00:14:33,225
Oh, that's terrible.

422
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,085
I inspired him to reach out
to his daughter.

423
00:14:35,110 --> 00:14:36,830
They've been on the outs
since she divorced.

424
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:38,135
She's here now, cooking for him.

425
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,339
That's nice.

they've been fighting

for a full half hour.

He pinched some girl's ass, she saw.

430
00:14:45,939 --> 00:14:47,983
May have been
the cancer guy's daughter.

431
00:14:48,419 --> 00:14:50,242
Oh, I hope she did nothing
to encourage that.

You look nice, by the way.

Okay, this is the worst party
I've ever been to.

00:15:02,189 --> 00:15:04,525
We just walked in the door.

- What a drip.
- You're the drip.

right mind go to parties?

some Sno Balls and a beer,

Your husband looks thrilled.

Maybe we do need a better
motivator for men

to get them to care
about the silver anniversary.

469

Because what man really cares
about silver?

00:16:10,546 --> 00:16:14,091
Maybe 25 years is the Yankees
season tickets anniversary.

Me, personally, I-I was never
great at gift-giving.

the same way.

480
00:16:34,343 --> 00:16:36,428
For Christmas,
a gentile would get a bike

as a reminder
that their parents love them.

482
00:16:38,824 --> 00:16:40,986
For Hanukkah, we would get socks

483
00:16:41,011 --> 00:16:43,050

See? Parties aren't so bad.

Hmm. I'm just trying to
figure out the best way

- Your what?

00:17:40,303 --> 00:17:41,666
Whatever it is, he's picking it up.

518
00:17:41,691 --> 00:17:44,045
It looks like a towel... nope,
it's the cat.

- He slipped on the cat?
- MIDGE: And he is angry.

We'll ease you in

on a tour of the facility,

might be my colleague, Sven.

Sven is a great fellow.

MIDGE: I was cornered by Mrs.
Klaviter today...

1204
00:43:07,978 --> 00:43:09,778
Ever since she kicked
Junie Paul in the shins,

1205
00:43:09,803 --> 00:43:11,950
- I run when I see her.
- She starts telling me this story

1206
00:43:11,975 --> 00:43:13,427
- about her mother's health.
- Mm.

1207
00:43:13,452 --> 00:43:15,787
And right as she says
she's only got a month to live,

the baby starts laughing.

1209

I tell you, it was
the world's longest pause.

00:43:20,952 --> 00:43:23,573
But then, Mrs. Klaviter laughed, too.

1211
00:43:23,630 --> 00:43:26,590
Turns out, she hates her mother
and thinks Esther's a delight.

ROSE: What ever happened to Junie Paul?

1216
00:43:37,375 --> 00:43:39,041
I wonder if she ever married.

1217
00:43:39,083 --> 00:43:40,303
I would think.

1218
00:43:40,328 --> 00:43:41,859
ROSE: She just needed to
keep her hair long enough

1219
00:43:41,884 --> 00:43:44,331
- to cover those ears.
- They were enormous,

1220
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:45,713
but she could hear someone whispering

1221

I planned theme nights,
