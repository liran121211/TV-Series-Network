00:08:12,876 --> 00:08:14,436
with his suitcase and his portable bar,

178
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:16,630
and just like that, three became four.

179
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:18,161
Now five.

180
00:08:18,263 --> 00:08:19,714
Who knows besides me?

181
00:08:19,771 --> 00:08:22,857
My parents. Joel, Archie.

182
00:08:23,092 --> 00:08:24,802
Well, we won't tell.

183
00:08:24,827 --> 00:08:26,453
People will find out, eventually.

184
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:29,043
I should just come out with it
and tell everyone

185
00:08:29,068 --> 00:08:30,361
and get it over with.

186
00:08:30,462 --> 00:08:32,688
All right, let's think this through.

187
00:08:32,713 --> 00:08:34,215
If you do tell people, then at least

188
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,747
you could control the narrative.

189
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:36,965
You know what I mean...

190
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,497
frame yourself in the best light.

191
00:08:38,522 --> 00:08:40,722
Done right, maybe you just get
pushed back a row or two,

192
00:08:40,797 --> 00:08:42,118
not all the way into "the corner."

193
00:08:42,307 --> 00:08:43,516
Maybe.

194
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,204
Unless you think Joel is coming back.

195
00:08:45,235 --> 00:08:46,862
'Cause if you think he's coming
back, then it's better

196
00:08:46,887 --> 00:08:48,448
you don't tell anybody,
because then he'll be back,

197
00:08:48,473 --> 00:08:49,969
and no one will have known he left.

198
00:08:49,994 --> 00:08:51,847
But if you tell them he left,
and then he comes back,

199
00:08:51,872 --> 00:08:53,982
you'll still be the person that
he left, only now he's back.

200
00:08:54,007 --> 00:08:55,235
But they'll know that you were left,

201
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,388
even though you aren't left now.

202
00:08:56,413 --> 00:08:57,456
And I don't know what corner
of the room

203
00:08:57,481 --> 00:08:58,732
you stand in to be that person.

00:14:43,803 --> 00:14:45,847
- Did you know the answer?
- No.

351
00:14:45,913 --> 00:14:48,197
No? Did you know the answer?

352
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:49,491
- No.
- No.

353
00:14:49,527 --> 00:14:51,946
So none of you knew the answer.

354
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:53,616
- ALL: No.
- But Truman.

355
00:14:53,641 --> 00:14:55,885
But we could have known
the answer. That's the point.

356
00:14:55,910 --> 00:14:57,852
Could have?

357
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,483
Could have. Charlie...

358
00:15:00,508 --> 00:15:02,973
- Lance.
- Could have doesn't count.

359
00:15:03,286 --> 00:15:05,120
Maybe doesn't count.

360
00:15:05,234 --> 00:15:07,612
"I took a shot" doesn't count.

361
00:15:07,637 --> 00:15:10,712
Because this room is a sanctuary

362
00:15:10,737 --> 00:15:13,066
from the variables
in the outside world.

363
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:16,648
In this room, we deal with absolutes.

364
00:15:17,590 --> 00:15:18,743
Period.

365
00:15:18,768 --> 00:15:20,410
In this room...

366
00:15:20,435 --> 00:15:22,812
this is what counts.

367
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:27,632
These two vectors are collinear.

368
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:31,040
They go... together.

369
00:15:31,171 --> 00:15:34,075
And they will always go together.

370
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:37,604
This is the solemn vow
made by mathematics.

371
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:41,668
In this room, v-two is never
going to break that vow

372
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:44,284
and decide that it doesn't need
the other vector anymore,

373
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:47,295
that it's gonna run off
and become linearly independent.

374
00:15:47,643 --> 00:15:50,692
V-two is never going
to come home from work one day

375
00:15:50,966 --> 00:15:52,900
and tell v-one, "You know what?

376
00:15:52,930 --> 00:15:56,225
"I think I need my own vector space.

377
00:15:56,921 --> 00:15:58,648
See ya."

378
00:15:58,737 --> 00:16:02,031
And then v-one's dad has
to come in and tell her, "No",

379
00:16:02,059 --> 00:16:03,894
"you can't let v-two do that.

380
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:06,765
You-you got to go get v-two back,"

381
00:16:07,052 --> 00:16:08,253
an impermanent solution,

382
00:16:08,278 --> 00:16:12,782
because v-one's dad is not
gonna be around forever

383
00:16:13,294 --> 00:16:17,000
to solve all of v-one's problems.

384
00:16:17,256 --> 00:16:19,175

And just like that, Joel left,
in the middle of the night,

395
00:17:03,154 --> 00:17:05,240
- like a cat burglar.
- DRINA: God, that's terrible.

396
00:17:05,384 --> 00:17:06,927
I'm so surprised. He seemed

397
00:17:06,952 --> 00:17:09,337
so crazy about Midge.
You want sugar today?

398
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:10,801
No. Maybe a lump.

399
00:17:10,826 --> 00:17:12,369
- Two lumps.
- I put in three.

400
00:17:12,494 --> 00:17:14,371
It's a stressful time.

401
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:16,230
- Drink.
- Mm.

402
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,958
How is poor Miriam?

403
00:17:19,983 --> 00:17:21,735
Oh, who can tell with her?

404
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,670
You know, maybe I sensed something.

405
00:17:23,694 --> 00:17:26,322
But just last week, I told her
to get pregnant again.

406
00:17:26,951 --> 00:17:28,104
Hmm. Too hot.

407
00:17:28,129 --> 00:17:30,839
I told her, "Three before 30."
That was my mistake.

408
00:17:30,909 --> 00:17:32,870
I waited too long
between Miriam and Noah.

409
00:17:32,895 --> 00:17:35,398
- I could only fit in two.
- You need to drink the tea, honey.

410
00:17:35,423 --> 00:17:36,644
But Miriam is Miriam.

411
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:38,420
She wanted to play and run around

412
00:17:38,445 --> 00:17:41,198
dressed in black like a Fellini film.

413
00:17:41,549 --> 00:17:42,874
It's fine now.

414
00:17:42,903 --> 00:17:44,571
There's beer in her refrigerator.

415
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:46,431
- Oh, dear.
- Joel thinks she's frivolous.

416
00:17:46,456 --> 00:17:48,729
- That's why he left.
- She's always been her own girl.

417
00:17:48,754 --> 00:17:49,766
- Mm.
- Do you remember when

418
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:51,631
she wanted to learn to drive?

419
00:17:51,724 --> 00:17:53,584
Because she found pink driving gloves.

420
00:17:53,609 --> 00:17:55,527
Everything with Midge starts
with an accessory.

421
00:17:55,552 --> 00:17:57,040
How's Abe taking all this?

422
00:17:57,065 --> 00:17:59,251
Abe got up this morning
and went to work.

423
00:17:59,617 --> 00:18:01,856
The world could be ending,
and he'd get up and go to work.

424
00:18:01,881 --> 00:18:04,156
And if Columbia University fell
into the ocean,

425
00:18:04,195 --> 00:18:06,447
he'd work from home.

426
00:18:07,867 --> 00:18:09,958
- Here.
- Does the rabbi know?

427
00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:11,821
- What? No. God, no.
- Good.

428
00:18:11,846 --> 00:18:13,851
- Can you imagine?
- I don't want to.

429
00:18:13,876 --> 00:18:15,316
We're all sick. That's what he knows.

430
00:18:15,341 --> 00:18:17,203
Very, very sick.
You did not see me today.

431
00:18:17,228 --> 00:18:19,876
Who am I talking to?
No one. I'm alone here.

432
00:18:19,901 --> 00:18:22,529
Okay, let's take a look at this.

433
00:18:22,554 --> 00:18:24,305
I failed her. I failed her somehow.

434
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:26,090
My whole family, everyone's married.

435
00:18:26,115 --> 00:18:27,992
Abe's family, everyone's married.

436
00:18:28,017 --> 00:18:30,433
I should've sent her to Paris.
My mother sent me to Paris.

437
00:18:30,458 --> 00:18:33,252
Paris is wonderful,
but it's good Midge didn't go.

438
00:18:33,383 --> 00:18:35,135
There was danger for her there.

439
00:18:35,237 --> 00:18:37,448
- Too much bread.
- Yes.

440
00:18:37,503 --> 00:18:39,213
Okay, let's see.

441
00:18:39,314 --> 00:18:40,730
I just need to know whether or not

442
00:18:40,755 --> 00:18:42,643
this separation is actually
going to happen.

443
00:18:42,685 --> 00:18:44,689
- I see a hammer.
- Is a hammer good?

444
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,455
It is if you want to hang a picture.

445
00:18:46,488 --> 00:18:48,365
Please, Drina...

446
00:18:48,407 --> 00:18:51,529
A hammer means triumph.
You will triumph.

447
00:18:51,576 --> 00:18:56,789
And the leaves say this journey
will end in peace and happiness.

448
00:18:56,814 --> 00:18:59,790
Triumph? Peace and happiness?
You're sure?

449
00:18:59,815 --> 00:19:01,796
- You're doubting the leaves?
- No. Never.

450
00:19:01,821 --> 00:19:04,899
Okay, you're still nervous.
Drina knows this.

451
00:19:04,924 --> 00:19:06,467
I'll tell you what.

452
00:19:06,508 --> 00:19:08,761
I'll throw in a charm. Put this

453
00:19:08,802 --> 00:19:11,598
under Miriam's pillow for a week.

454
00:19:11,623 --> 00:19:13,166
It'll help the luck stick.

455
00:19:13,407 --> 00:19:15,033
My God, what is that smell?

456
00:19:15,058 --> 00:19:16,393
Tannis root. Just tell Miriam

457
00:19:16,418 --> 00:19:18,629
a rat died in the wall or something.

458
00:19:18,811 --> 00:19:20,591
- Thank you, Drina.
- Don't worry.

459
00:19:20,616 --> 00:19:22,701
Miriam will land on her feet.

460
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,002
Take it from me.

up here looking for you.

464
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:40,820
I asked him to wait down here,
but he pushed right past.

465
00:19:40,845 --> 00:19:42,500
- Almost bit me.
- Oh, no.

466
00:19:42,525 --> 00:19:44,711
- Hey, I'm calling the cops right now.
- Don't call the cops.

00:19:44,736 --> 00:19:46,271
Everything's fine!

I got up at 9:30. In the morning.

You know the last time I was up
at 9:30 in the morning?

475

It was the last time
I stayed out all night

476
00:20:03,361 --> 00:20:05,144
and got home at 9:30 in the morning.

That is the last time I was up

Hey, you came to me, okay?

480
00:20:10,557 --> 00:20:12,076
You know, I-I didn't ask you
to bang on my door.

481
00:20:12,101 --> 00:20:13,701
I didn't even tell you
where my door was.

482
00:20:13,726 --> 00:20:14,855
You figured out where it was

483
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,800
and then you came there
and then you banged on it

484
00:20:16,825 --> 00:20:18,361
- of your own free will.
- I forgot.

485
00:20:18,687 --> 00:20:20,165
Oh, much better.

486
00:20:20,207 --> 00:20:22,167
It is so much better
that you just forgot.

487
00:20:22,246 --> 00:20:23,809
You know, my fear
was that you remembered

488
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,331

Where is your airplane,
in the bathroom?

00:20:39,421 --> 00:20:41,624
I had no idea you were such
an important person.

497
00:20:41,649 --> 00:20:44,009
If I had realized that the queen
of England had stood me up,

498
00:20:44,154 --> 00:20:45,899
I would have understood.
But I just thought

499
00:20:45,941 --> 00:20:47,685
you were some drunk housewife
who needed my help.

500
00:20:47,744 --> 00:20:50,884
I had no idea you were related
to fucking Charlemagne.

501
00:20:52,114 --> 00:20:53,758
'Cause if Catherine the Great
had shown up and said,

502
00:20:53,782 --> 00:20:55,593
"Hey, let's meet at 10:00," I
probably wouldn't have expected

503
00:20:55,617 --> 00:20:58,579
her to show up either. But you
have to tell people who you are.

504
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,079
'Cause if all they have to go on
is the fact

505
00:21:00,104 --> 00:21:01,915
that you make appointments
and then forget about them,

506
00:21:02,026 --> 00:21:03,906
they're just gonna think
you're a stuck-up twat.

507
00:21:03,931 --> 00:21:05,239
It's an easy mistake to make.

508
00:21:05,394 --> 00:21:06,886
I almost made that same mistake.

00:21:06,911 --> 00:21:09,151
But then I saw your dining room
was set for Parliament...

What? Where are we going?

Why am I touching this child?

- Why is this child touching me?
- Hi, lady.

00:21:29,026 --> 00:21:32,183
Where has his hand been that
it is now currently very sticky?

521
00:21:32,234 --> 00:21:33,736
[ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]

522
00:21:33,838 --> 00:21:36,517
Hi, lady. -Why am I
still holding this child?

523
00:21:36,601 --> 00:21:38,228
He can't find his way home from here?

524
00:21:38,316 --> 00:21:40,236
I made it home just fine
when my mother forgot me

525
00:21:40,261 --> 00:21:41,416
at the Armistice Day Parade.

526
00:21:41,464 --> 00:21:43,258
An old soldier with one arm
gave me a nickel

527
00:21:43,283 --> 00:21:45,244
and I took the bus home.
Oh, you're welcome!

528
00:21:45,495 --> 00:21:48,081
Real polite kid you got there.
Good job.

529
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:49,546
Would you like some iced tea?

530
00:21:49,588 --> 00:21:50,971
Hmm. Do I want some iced tea?

531
00:21:50,996 --> 00:21:52,581
Let me think. Fuck you.

532
00:21:52,706 --> 00:21:55,333
No, I do not want any iced tea.

533
00:21:55,469 --> 00:21:57,262
[SCOFFS] First, you stand me up.

534
00:21:57,324 --> 00:21:59,952
Then you Bataan Death March me
through Buckingham Palace.

535
00:22:00,046 --> 00:22:01,756
You make me hold
your kid's filthy hand,

536
00:22:01,781 --> 00:22:04,101
which means I probably got 14
different kinds of cholera right now.

537
00:22:04,126 --> 00:22:05,596
Sit down. I'll get us some iced tea.

538
00:22:05,621 --> 00:22:07,832
Sit where? Here? What, on this?
Are you kidding me?

539
00:22:07,857 --> 00:22:09,150
I'm not sitting in here.

540
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,540
This is not furniture for sitting!

541
00:22:10,658 --> 00:22:12,058
This is furniture you get appraised

542
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:13,158
when a rich uncle dies.

543
00:22:13,183 --> 00:22:14,726
You really should put plastic

544
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:16,502
- over all of this.
- It's fine.

545
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:18,571
Are those two really your children

546
00:22:18,596 --> 00:22:20,746
or did we just break in
and kidnap a couple kids?

547
00:22:20,771 --> 00:22:23,565
- Of course they're mine.
- Well, just making sure.

548
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,550
I mean, when you fraternize
with an ex-con...

549
00:22:25,585 --> 00:22:28,129
Hey, did you know that I have
to get a lawyer and go to court?

550
00:22:28,165 --> 00:22:29,455
- Yes.
- Even though I got

551
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:31,150
bailed out on the night I got arrested.

552
00:22:31,175 --> 00:22:32,939
What the hell does that
have to do with anything?

553
00:22:32,964 --> 00:22:35,494
- So it's not a thing?
- No, it's not a thing.

554
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:37,438
Why do I have it in my head
that it's a thing?

555
00:22:37,463 --> 00:22:40,119
I don't know, lady. Maybe
it's all that royal inbreeding.

556
00:22:40,144 --> 00:22:42,566
- This is not that fancy of an apartment.
- [CHUCKLES]

557
00:22:42,591 --> 00:22:44,969
It's just ridiculous. That
whole getting arrested thing.

558
00:22:44,994 --> 00:22:46,620
So I said some bad words.

559
00:22:46,645 --> 00:22:48,105
Well, and you flashed the room.

560
00:22:48,726 --> 00:22:50,757
- What?
- You flashed the room.

561
00:22:50,782 --> 00:22:51,807
You pulled your top down.

562
00:22:51,832 --> 00:22:53,891
- Oh, I did not.
- You did, too.

563
00:22:53,916 --> 00:22:55,549
You hit a switch and out they came.

564
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:57,314
- That's ridiculous.
- "Soup's on, boys!"

565
00:22:57,339 --> 00:22:59,517
- If I did that, I'd remember.
- Mm.

566
00:22:59,658 --> 00:23:01,603
- Cake?
- No, I do not want cake.

567
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:03,463
You know what, I would like
to know what I am doing...

568
00:23:03,497 --> 00:23:04,603
Oh, wow.

569
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,400
That-that is an adorable cake.

570
00:23:06,748 --> 00:23:08,250
I'm sorry about today.

571
00:23:08,292 --> 00:23:09,585
I really am.

572
00:23:09,626 --> 00:23:11,170
Okay.

573
00:23:11,303 --> 00:23:13,309
Let's just forget
about this morning, okay?

574
00:23:13,366 --> 00:23:15,508
I'm here. We can start now.

575
00:23:15,687 --> 00:23:17,088
You have any paper? Pen?

576
00:23:17,259 --> 00:23:19,147
Maybe parchment and a quill?

577
00:23:19,172 --> 00:23:20,913
Why? -So I can write down
some stuff for you

578
00:23:20,938 --> 00:23:22,523
- to talk about onstage.
- No, no, no.

579
00:23:22,548 --> 00:23:23,975
Look, I'm-I'm sorry about this morning,

580
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,629
but that woman last night,

581
00:23:25,654 --> 00:23:26,864
she was not me.

582
00:23:26,889 --> 00:23:29,179
- This is me. I am me.
- Uh-huh.

583
00:23:29,204 --> 00:23:30,742
I'm the woman who's gonna be standing

584
00:23:30,801 --> 00:23:32,511
in the corner next to Martha Kilgallin,

585
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:35,011
- desperate and sweating like a pig.
- There are two Ls

586
00:23:35,036 --> 00:23:36,739
- in "Kilgallin"?
- I'm the woman who's gonna get elbowed

587
00:23:36,764 --> 00:23:38,575
out of the way at the butcher
shop so that other women

588
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,881
can get the best lamb chops.
Other women who have husbands

589
00:23:40,906 --> 00:23:43,343
to shop for. Nobody cares if
you're ordering steak for one.

590
00:23:43,368 --> 00:23:45,746
That-That's me. That's
the real me we're dealing with.

591
00:23:45,771 --> 00:23:49,016
And she's not fun.
She's sad and embarrassed

592
00:23:49,041 --> 00:23:50,520
and poten... What are you doing?

593
00:23:50,545 --> 00:23:52,025
I'm making notes. This is great stuff.

594
00:23:52,050 --> 00:23:53,299
This is not great stuff.

595
00:23:53,364 --> 00:23:55,657
This is my life falling apart.

596
00:23:55,682 --> 00:23:57,951
My husband left me.
Do you understand that?

597
00:23:58,022 --> 00:24:00,249
He left me, left my children.
You've met my children.

598
00:24:00,274 --> 00:24:02,377
I did. One of 'em gave me
bubonic plague.

599
00:24:02,402 --> 00:24:04,526
It was jelly, goddamn it.
Children get jelly

600
00:24:04,551 --> 00:24:06,264
- on their hands.
- Okay. Relax.

601
00:24:06,289 --> 00:24:08,644
The woman who showed up at that
club and said those crazy things

602
00:24:08,669 --> 00:24:09,897
was in a state.

603
00:24:10,058 --> 00:24:11,749
A manic emotional state.

604
00:24:11,774 --> 00:24:13,314
Bullshit. You loved it.

605
00:24:13,339 --> 00:24:16,877
Yes! For a moment
it-it was glorious, okay?

606
00:24:16,902 --> 00:24:18,703
F-For one moment, I said and did things

607
00:24:18,728 --> 00:24:20,689
that I've never done or said before.

608
00:24:20,722 --> 00:24:22,766
But-but that is all
a complete blur to me now.

609
00:24:23,075 --> 00:24:25,196
I don't know how I got there.

610
00:24:25,221 --> 00:24:26,703
I wouldn't know how to get there again.

611
00:24:26,728 --> 00:24:29,356
And I'm not gonna try.
Do you understand?

612
00:24:30,832 --> 00:24:31,955
Yeah.

613
00:24:31,992 --> 00:24:34,020
I understand.

614
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:36,296
Made me come all the way
to the Upper West Side.

615
00:24:36,338 --> 00:24:37,979
Didn't even have
a doctor's appointment.

616
00:24:38,004 --> 00:24:39,174
Wait.

617
00:24:53,772 --> 00:24:55,774
For the bail.

618
00:25:02,303 --> 00:25:04,305
See ya.

619
00:25:13,007 --> 00:25:14,676
[SIGHS]

620
00:25:17,112 --> 00:25:19,423
Not too many fatty pieces.
It's all he'll eat.

621
00:25:19,464 --> 00:25:20,542
Yes, Mrs. Weissman.

622
00:25:20,567 --> 00:25:22,152
The rest can be leftovers for tomorrow.

[PHONE RINGS]

624
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:26,801
Abe! Dinner's on the table!

625
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:28,780
- Hello?
- Rosie?

626
00:25:28,805 --> 00:25:30,155
Oh, my God, Rosie, is that you?

627
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,677
Yes, it's me, Shirley.

628
00:25:31,702 --> 00:25:33,412
Rosie, I'm beside myself.

629
00:25:33,437 --> 00:25:35,564
I feel like a building
just fell on my head.

630
00:25:35,589 --> 00:25:37,174
A block. A whole block.

631
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,596
I feel like 34th
between Sixth and Seventh

632
00:25:39,657 --> 00:25:41,709
just fell right on my head.

633
00:25:41,734 --> 00:25:43,354
I thought dinner was on the table.

634
00:25:43,387 --> 00:25:44,857
Calm down. You sound winded.

635
00:25:44,882 --> 00:25:46,676
I see carrots, potatoes...

636
00:25:46,701 --> 00:25:48,529
Oh, hey, the salad's on the table.

637
00:25:48,554 --> 00:25:50,356
- I'm talking to Shirley.
- Shirley?

638
00:25:50,381 --> 00:25:51,901
- Mm.
- Oh, great. Tell her to hang on.

639
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:53,302
I want to put her on speakerphone.

640
00:25:53,327 --> 00:25:54,730
Shirley, will you hold on
just one minute?

641
00:25:54,755 --> 00:25:56,235
You're not hanging up on me, are you?

642
00:25:56,298 --> 00:25:57,756
No, I'll be right back.

643
00:25:57,781 --> 00:26:00,326
People think I'm such
a strong person, but I'm not.

644
00:26:00,597 --> 00:26:02,641
Hurry, before she hangs herself
with the phone cord.

645
00:26:02,709 --> 00:26:05,587
Okay. And... go.

646
00:26:05,802 --> 00:26:07,763
Shirley, are you still there?

647
00:26:07,804 --> 00:26:09,366
- Barely.
- Okay, good.

648
00:26:09,391 --> 00:26:10,659
Go ahead. You were saying?

649
00:26:10,684 --> 00:26:13,306
I was saying my heart is broken.

650
00:26:13,331 --> 00:26:14,788
- [QUIETLY]: Excellent.
- What?

651
00:26:14,813 --> 00:26:15,937
Nothing. Go ahead, Shirley.

652
00:26:15,962 --> 00:26:17,923
I didn't get to have
my Yom Kippur dinner.

653
00:26:17,984 --> 00:26:19,694
It was ripped out from under me.

654
00:26:19,729 --> 00:26:22,607
Just like when we went to Boca
and we saw this magician

655
00:26:22,632 --> 00:26:24,156
and he ripped a tablecloth out

656
00:26:24,181 --> 00:26:26,475
from under a completely set table.

657
00:26:26,617 --> 00:26:28,910
Only in my case,
everything falls to the floor

658
00:26:28,992 --> 00:26:31,063
and smashes into a million pieces.

659
00:26:31,088 --> 00:26:32,269
Tell her to speak up a little.

660
00:26:32,294 --> 00:26:33,670
Shirley, dear, could you speak up?

661
00:26:33,760 --> 00:26:36,600
I look forward to that dinner all year!

662
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,127
But then I heard you all had
such a terrible flu.

663
00:26:39,152 --> 00:26:41,570
My heart stopped.
I mean, the flu is very serious.

664
00:26:41,595 --> 00:26:43,972
People die from the flu.
But when Moishe told me

665
00:26:43,997 --> 00:26:46,458
you didn't actually have
the flu, I was so relieved.

666
00:26:46,503 --> 00:26:48,546
"Thank God, I don't have
to worry about that."

667
00:26:48,669 --> 00:26:50,546
But then he said the kids split up,

668
00:26:50,594 --> 00:26:53,617
and suddenly I just wished
everybody had the flu.

669
00:26:53,642 --> 00:26:55,216
- Split up?
- Now what do I have?

670
00:26:55,241 --> 00:26:56,701
No Yom Kippur.

671
00:26:56,726 --> 00:26:57,913
No daughter-in-law.

672
00:26:57,938 --> 00:26:59,300
No grandchildren.

673
00:26:59,325 --> 00:27:00,910
You'll always have the grandchildren.

674
00:27:00,973 --> 00:27:03,104
Oh, well, sure,
yes, as a concept, but...

675
00:27:03,129 --> 00:27:06,106
Shirley, when did you hear
the kids were breaking up?

676
00:27:06,139 --> 00:27:08,046
- Just now.
- You're sure?

677
00:27:08,071 --> 00:27:10,865
Yes. Joel came to see Moishe
this afternoon and...

678
00:27:11,361 --> 00:27:13,144
Wait, who is this? Who am I talking to?

679
00:27:13,169 --> 00:27:15,424
That was Abe, Shirley.
Now, try and calm down.

680
00:27:15,449 --> 00:27:17,209
I promise you'll see
the grandchildren again.

681
00:27:17,234 --> 00:27:19,955
When? When am I gonna see them again?

682
00:27:20,007 --> 00:27:22,304
Next Yom Kippur? What am I, 20?

683
00:27:22,337 --> 00:27:23,964
I could be dead in an hour!

684
00:27:24,005 --> 00:27:26,096
I hear there's a terrible flu
going around.

685
00:27:26,121 --> 00:27:28,874
No, the flu wasn't real,
Shirley. The flu was an excuse.

686
00:27:28,939 --> 00:27:32,370
Now people need an excuse
not to see family?

687
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,536
What a world.

688
00:27:33,561 --> 00:27:35,691
She didn't go to him.
I told Miriam to go to him

689
00:27:35,716 --> 00:27:37,509
- and she didn't go to him.

I won't, though. I am still a lady.

1207
00:48:37,968 --> 00:48:40,123
And a lady never kicks men
repeatedly in the balls

Officer, sorry, I work alone.

1217

Now, and apparently
for the rest of my life.

pearls and fucks my boyfriend.
