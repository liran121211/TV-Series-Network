SUSIE: You coulda told me
he was a fucking doctor.

184
00:06:59,294 --> 00:07:01,296
MIDGE: I know.
I'm sorry.

185
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:03,191
If I'd have known, I would've
said that the kid

186
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:04,455
had been abducted or something.

187
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,051
I promise to tell you next time.

188
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:07,636
And what do we need a code for?

189
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:09,906
All you have to do is call and
say, "I picked another loser,

190
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,306
come the fuck down and save me."

191
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,350
We need the code in case he
walks by and hears me.

192
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,893
I don't want to hurt
his feelings.

193
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:16,937
Well, all I know is this is the
third crappy date

194
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,147
you've been on this month.

195
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,232
You gotta kiss some frogs.

196
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:21,775
You can't date civilians.

197
00:07:21,859 --> 00:07:23,878
- Well, who am I going to date?
- Someone in the business.

198
00:07:23,902 --> 00:07:25,571
I am not gonna date a comic.

199
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:28,407
A comic? God, no. You fuck that
frog before you date a comic.

200
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,535
- Then who?
- I don't know.

201
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:32,828
How about a ventriloquist?

202
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,551
Why the hell would I
date a ventriloquist?

203
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:35,914
He goes around with a toy.

204
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:37,433
You've got kids.
Seems like a slam dunk to me.

205
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:38,457
You've gotta be kidding.

206
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,727
At least he's bound to
have a personality.

207
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:40,836
Two, actually.

208
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:42,671
- A ventriloquist?
- Yes.

209
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:44,107
A man who sits with a wooden
version of a tiny man

210
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:45,048
on his lap and tries
to make it talk.

211
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,276
That's who you want me to date?

212
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,010
When I look at you,
I see ventriloquist.

213
00:07:51,013 --> 00:07:52,222
Hey, Susie...

214
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:53,724
What, Miriam?

215
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:57,436
- When was the last relationship that you had?
- What?

216
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,564
We always talk about me and my
relationships. What about you?

217
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:01,791
I haven't seen you with anybody

218
00:08:01,815 --> 00:08:03,734
- since we've been together.
- So?

219
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,612
- Just curious about your life.
- My life is you. That's it.

220
00:08:06,695 --> 00:08:08,947
Thinking about you.
Talking about you.

221
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:11,742
Waiting for you, rescuing you
from bullshit dates.

222
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:13,469
- I don't have time for anything else.
- Yeah, but...

223
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,204
As soon as I get you off my
fucking hands

224
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,539
and make you a star, I can shove
you out on an iceberg

225
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:19,208
and focus on something else.

226
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,418
Fine.

227
00:08:23,587 --> 00:08:24,796
What?

228
00:08:26,798 --> 00:08:28,401
Maybe I've been hanging out
with you for too long,

229
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:30,469
but I actually do think
you wore the wrong hat.

230
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:35,599
TV HOST: Two years ago, you
directed Vertigo,

231
00:08:35,682 --> 00:08:38,518
Terrific film. Last year, it
was North By Northwest,

232
00:08:38,602 --> 00:08:40,479
which completely ruined my love

233
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,064
of long walks through
cornfields.

234
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:44,107
- Mission accomplished.
- (LAUGHTER)

235
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:47,569
And now we have Psycho, which
I understand is very scary.

236
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:49,571
So, let me ask you,
Mr. Hitchcock,

237
00:08:49,655 --> 00:08:51,490
because I'm curious:
What scares you?

238
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:53,450
Hard-boiled eggs.

239
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:56,203
Hard-boiled eggs.
I-I was not expecting that.

240
00:08:56,286 --> 00:08:59,373
I was thinking more
spiders, or ex-wives.

241
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:01,458
I find them disgusting.

242
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:04,878
Do you not find hard-boiled
eggs disgusting?

243
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:07,631
I confess, I have not put
much thought into it.

244
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,383
Well, you should...

245
00:09:09,466 --> 00:09:11,426
(TV CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)

246
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:16,348
MIDGE: Ethan, if you
have to make pee-pee,

247
00:09:16,431 --> 00:09:18,850
just pee-pee and go back to bed.

248
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:20,310
It's not Ethan.

249
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:22,562
Papa, if you have to
make pee-pee,

250
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,773
just pee-pee and go back to bed.

251
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,817
I don't have to make pee-pee!

252
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:29,736
Could I have a quick word
with you, please?

253
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,446
Hold on.

254
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:35,617
- (THUMP)
- Ow.

255
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:38,870
- What time is it?
- It's midnight.

256
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:42,207
And Susie is blasting
that damn TV again.

257
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:43,667
She's been having
trouble sleeping.

258
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,502
The TV helps her relax.

259
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,170
Has she tried sleeping pills?

260
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:50,340
Your mother has a gallon jug
of them in the closet.

261
00:09:50,424 --> 00:09:52,301
She says they make her
loopy the next day.

262
00:09:52,384 --> 00:09:54,594
Same with your mother,
but who can tell?

263
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:56,930
Who says my pills make me loopy?

264
00:09:57,014 --> 00:09:58,807
I was just saying to Miriam

265
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,768
that Susie has stayed here
longer than expected.

266
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:04,896
Her friend dying in her
apartment really threw her.

267
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:08,567
I'm sorry, but when my close
friend Mordecai Glickman

268
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,444
died playing squash,

269
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,697
I was back on the squash court
at 6:00 the next morning.

270
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:15,490
I forgot that it was
to play Mordecai,

271
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:17,534
so it was all for naught,
but you get my point.

272
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:19,870
Her time here does seem endless.

273
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:22,122
And I told Asher
he could bunk here.

274
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:25,167
Should I steer him to
some godforsaken motel?

275
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,170
There's room for Asher. It'll
be tight, but we'll get by.

276
00:10:28,253 --> 00:10:30,005
Can I get anyone anything?

277
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,799
Zelda, it's so late.
Why are you here?

278
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:35,093
Miss Susie is using
a plate and a glass,

279
00:10:35,177 --> 00:10:37,387
so I stayed late
so I can wash them.

280
00:10:37,471 --> 00:10:38,990
Zelda, I'll wash Susie's
plates when she's done.

281
00:10:39,014 --> 00:10:41,134
- But that's my job, Miss Miriam.
- It doesn't matter.

282
00:10:41,183 --> 00:10:43,560
So I should go to
the comedy buildings

283
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,563
and make with the jokes...
because it doesn't matter?

284
00:10:46,688 --> 00:10:48,690
Is the TV too loud?

285
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:51,318
What TV? I didn't hear
the TV. Was it on?

286
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,695
- I can turn it down.
- You don't need to turn it down.

287
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:56,114
I'm gonna find my own place
any day, I promise.

288
00:10:56,198 --> 00:10:58,575
Stay as long as you like,
Susie. Really.

289
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:02,371
Yes, yes, the invitation
is open-ended.

290
00:11:02,454 --> 00:11:04,081
Good night, Susie.

291
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:07,542
- See you in the morning.
- Yeah.

292
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:09,878
What are you still doing here?

293
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,220
- Excuse me, Abe?
- Yeah.

294
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:19,554
There's a guy here.

295
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,115
He's been sitting in the hallway
for half an hour.

296
00:11:21,139 --> 00:11:23,433
We finally asked, and he said
he was a friend of yours.

297
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,435
- Of mine?
- Then he said, "Check that.

298
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,497
Abe and I used to be friends,
because a friend doesn't

299
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,272
stab a friend in the back
with a rusty knife

300
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,167
dipped in arsenic, then wrap
a guitar string..."

301
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,902
I got it. Thank you, Isobel.

302
00:11:38,365 --> 00:11:41,368
- Asher.
- Abe. Hello.

303
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,120
Why didn't you come get me?

304
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:45,403
I could see you were busy
typing... it looked important.

305
00:11:45,455 --> 00:11:48,208
Maybe you were tattling
on a sick relative

306
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,336
or ratting out your son
for stealing a Necco Wafer

307
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:52,754
when he was 12.

308
00:11:52,838 --> 00:11:54,214
Moving on.

309
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,425
I have us all set up
with Michael Kessler

310
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,927
to deal with the FBI,
so feel at ease.

311
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:01,346
He's a great attorney.
Best in the business.

312
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,640
Sacco and Vanzetti had
the best in the business, too.

313
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:05,225
Must have been a great comfort

314
00:12:05,308 --> 00:12:06,768
as they sat
in their electric chairs

315
00:12:06,852 --> 00:12:08,812
listening to their brains melt.

316
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,189
I'm almost done here.
Come sit with me.

317
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:13,108
- I don't want to bother you.
- You want to

318
00:12:13,191 --> 00:12:15,819
walk around the Village
a bit? Get some souvenirs?

319
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:17,863
I stepped on a spent condom
coming in here,

320
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,781
so I'm all set for souvenirs.

321
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:22,742
Yes, good. Okay.
I'll be right out.

322
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,327
Don't rush.

323
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:28,999
Swear I had coffee cups
when I left the factory.

324
00:12:29,082 --> 00:12:31,001
- Just use a bowl.
- I don't have bowls.

325
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,044
You don't have bowls?
Don't you eat soup?

326
00:12:33,128 --> 00:12:35,338
I don't trust soup.
It tells you it's food,

327
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,899
but you eat it,
and you're never full.

328
00:12:36,923 --> 00:12:39,342
- (PHONE RINGS)
- Feels like a scam.

329
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:40,927
Hello?

330
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,762
- SHIRLEY: Hello, Joely.
- Hi, Ma.

331
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:45,265
- It's your mother, Shirley.
- I know, Ma.

332
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:46,868
- What can I do for you?
- Oh, nothing.

333
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:48,619
I was just checking in.
How's your new apartment?

334
00:12:48,643 --> 00:12:51,188
- It's great.
- So you don't miss us at all?

335
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,606
What do you need, Ma?

336
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,792
I was just wondering where
you're gonna be on Friday night.

337
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,419
- JOEL: I'll be at the club.
- You're sure?

338
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:57,360
- I'm sure.
- Around 8:00?

339
00:12:57,444 --> 00:12:59,446
- Why, Ma?
- No reason.

340
00:12:59,529 --> 00:13:01,198
- Is your blue suit pressed?
- Why, Ma?

341
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:03,241
Because you look very nice
in your blue suit.

342
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:05,410
- Thank you, but...
- Well, it was nice catching up.

343
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:08,163
Remember, wear your blue suit
Friday night. I love you.

344
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:11,166
- And your room is here when you want it.
- Ma?

345
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:12,477
- Wait, Ma.
- (LINE DISCONNECTS)

346
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:14,252
So, when this soup
tells you it's food,

347
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:17,088
does it speak or spell it out
in little alphabet letters or...

348
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,591
I think it's time
for you to meet my parents.

349
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,260
- Did you hear me?
- Nope.

350
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:23,821
I put them off
for as long as I could,

351
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:25,597
- but we are out of time.
- Nope.

352
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,641
- We have no choice.
- Nope.

353
00:13:27,724 --> 00:13:29,351
- Mei.
- Are you insane?

354
00:13:29,434 --> 00:13:32,020
- I know it'll be awkward.
- It'll be a disaster!

355
00:13:32,103 --> 00:13:34,147
Joel. I mean...

356
00:13:34,231 --> 00:13:35,690
They won't care
that you're short.

357
00:13:35,774 --> 00:13:38,276
But they will care that I look
like their dry cleaner.

358
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,612
You're in luck. My mother
does not use a dry cleaner.

359
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:43,114
Are you aware of all
the colorfully descriptive words

360
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:45,051
- that'll come to their minds when they see me?
- No.

361
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:46,677
- You want me to rattle them off?
- No, thanks.

362
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:48,203
I'll just write them down.

363
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,038
I've heard these terms
my entire life,

364
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,831
so the list
will be comprehensive.

365
00:13:51,915 --> 00:13:52,915
This is not helping.

366
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:54,292
Mei.

367
00:13:54,376 --> 00:13:55,919
- Mei.
- Hold on.

368
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,464
Okay. You made your point.

369
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:01,049
You think I'm an idiot?

370
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:03,012
I know that there's
a lot of ugly shit out there

371
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:05,136
that people...
Oh, now, that one, you made up.

372
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,660
That was my nickname
in kindergarten.

373
00:14:06,721 --> 00:14:08,640
Look, I know my parents.

374
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:11,101
You being Chinese...
Yes, it will be a surprise.

375
00:14:11,184 --> 00:14:13,562
But trust me, it will not
be their biggest problem.

376
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,021
- No?
- You not being Jewish,

377
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:16,290
that's gonna wake the neighbors.

378
00:14:16,314 --> 00:14:18,191
Right. They don't want you
with a gentile.

379
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:20,402
And a Chinese girl
is like a double gentile.

380
00:14:20,485 --> 00:14:22,237
Triple gentile. More.

381
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,549
Basically, you're walking in
with the Lawrence Welk singers.

382
00:14:24,573 --> 00:14:27,200
Well, what's the alternative,
huh? We're together.

383
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:29,578
They have to find out.
Your parents know.

384
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:31,288
Yes, they do.

385
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,707
Would you like to know all
the colorfully descriptive words

386
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,309
that came to their minds
when they found out?

387
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,960
I'll just write 'em down.

388
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:38,712
I'm gonna need a lot more paper.

389
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,714
Do you understand
what's happening here?

390
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:43,091
My mother's sending girls
to my workplace.

391
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,509
One's coming Friday,

392
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:46,473
and I have no proof
she's not sending the rabbi.

393
00:14:46,511 --> 00:14:48,698
Well, he's not much of a rabbi
if he's working on Friday.

394
00:14:48,722 --> 00:14:50,223
She won't stop till I'm married.

395
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:51,492
I'm okay with being a mistress.

396
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,035
- Well, I'm not.
- You were with Midge.

397
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:54,603
Hey.

398
00:14:54,686 --> 00:14:56,021
- Sorry.
- What the fuck?

399
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:58,523
I know. I'm sorry. I am. But...

400
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:02,027
I can't.

401
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,904
- I just can't.
- Mei.

402
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,866
Mei.

403
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:10,368
We have to discuss this.

404
00:15:10,452 --> 00:15:11,578
Mei?

405
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,581
You can't just run.

406
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,458
- I know where you live.
- No, you don't.

407
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:19,127
No, I don't. Fuck me.

408
00:15:20,754 --> 00:15:22,464
NICKY: (LAUGHING)
But what's funny is...

409
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,966
- Get this, get this.
- Yeah, this is fucking great.

410
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:27,594
Come on, all you told me
is you cut some guy's balls off.

411
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,554
Right, right. We cut them off.

412
00:15:29,638 --> 00:15:31,556
But we stuffed them
into the other guy's mouth.

413
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,141
And the other guy's balls

414
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,393
- got stuffed into the first guy's mouth.
- Yeah.

415
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:37,228
Yeah, when you cut off
a guy's balls,

416
00:15:37,312 --> 00:15:39,022
you're supposed to stuff them
in the mouth

417
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,815
of the guy
the fucking balls belong to.

418
00:15:40,899 --> 00:15:43,526
So we were like, "What do we do?
Switch them back?"

419
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:46,112
How do you do that? I mean,
rigor mortis was setting in.

420
00:15:46,196 --> 00:15:47,614
Their jaws were clenching tight.

421
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:49,425
Yeah, yeah. So,
we were weighing our options.

422
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,160
Then we heard sirens,
so we decided to split.

423
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:53,304
I know
you make half this shit up,

424
00:15:53,328 --> 00:15:54,388
but it's still fucking great.

425
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,748
Yeah,
we really don't make things up.

426
00:15:56,831 --> 00:15:58,559
- Hey, can I get another Coke?
- Hey, get two.

427
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,876
This is on us.

428
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,128
Whatever you want.
We haven't seen you in forever.

429
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:04,214
Mm, been too busy
licking my wounds.

430
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,508
Ah, Shy Baldwin.
He sings like an angel

431
00:16:06,591 --> 00:16:09,010
- but sounds like a douche.
- I don't want to talk about it.

432
00:16:09,094 --> 00:16:11,638
Well, he's Giancana's anyway,
so we can't touch him.

433
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:13,449
Right now, I'm just focused
on finding a place to live.

434
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,599
I'm crashing with Midge,

435
00:16:14,683 --> 00:16:16,559
but her family's
driving me nuts.

436
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,603
- What's your price point?
- For an apartment?

437
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,604
Well, be a stretch,

438
00:16:19,688 --> 00:16:20,998
but I could afford
a nickel a month.

439
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:22,941
Know any apartments
going for a nickel a month?

440
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,736
I, uh...
I think we could help you here.

441
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,905
- Really? How?
- We know a place.

442
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:31,032
- We'll take you later today.
- Great.

443
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:32,551
- Thanks.
- NICKY: And if it works out,

444
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,953
we can write this lunch off
on our taxes.

445
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,705
Taxes.

446
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,540

Excuse me, sir?

456
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,852
Hi. I was wondering...

457
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:46,274
Excuse me. Excuse me.

458
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,777
Hi. Sorry. I was just wondering

00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,255
- if perhaps you could help me with something.
- Help you with what?

460
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:54,365
Well, I am looking for a place,
a bar,

461
00:17:54,449 --> 00:17:57,786
where someone like me
but not me... a friend...

462
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:00,997
Could maybe drink
with someone else like me.

463
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,499
- What?
- You know,

464
00:18:02,582 --> 00:18:04,751
a place where a lady
could drink with another lady?

465
00:18:04,834 --> 00:18:06,419
I can't help you.

466
00:18:07,837 --> 00:18:10,215
Excuse me.
I am looking for a bar

467
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:12,801
where women like me can drink
with other women like me.

468
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:14,385
Or just women in general.

469
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:15,905
They don't have to be like me.
They just have to be...

470
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,055
- You're a cop.
- What?

471
00:18:17,138 --> 00:18:18,723
No, I'm not a cop.

472
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:20,517
This is Dior!

473
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,852
Excuse me. I am not a cop.

474
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,938
I have a record.

475
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,066
Hi. I'm not a cop.
I was just wondering...

476
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:30,068
Hello. I am not a cop.
I was won...

477
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,111
Hello. Not a cop.
I was just wondering...

478
00:18:32,195 --> 00:18:33,905
Hi. I'm not a cop. I'm not...

479
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,657
Not a cop. I...

480
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,909
I am not a cop.

481
00:18:44,165 --> 00:18:47,460
- So, you have a friend?
- I'm sorry?

482
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:50,880
I believe you were making
an inquiry for a friend?

483
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:53,049
Oh. Yes. I was.

484
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:55,343
My friend. Yes.
I was just wondering

485
00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:56,695
- if maybe...
- I know two or three places

486
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:58,012
you might be looking for.

487
00:18:58,096 --> 00:19:01,015
You do? Oh,
that would be wonderful.

488
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:03,351
And I assume there is no friend.

489
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,228
No, there is a friend. Really.

490
00:19:05,311 --> 00:19:06,229
If you insist.

491
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:07,647
I do. She is.

492
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:10,775
Okay. And this friend,
i-is she like you?

493
00:19:10,859 --> 00:19:11,860
- Me?
- Yeah.

494
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:14,028
Well, anatomically.
(CHUCKLES)

495
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,029
Does she dress like you?

496
00:19:15,113 --> 00:19:16,865
Like me? Oh, no.

497
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:18,491
No, no, no, no, no, no.

498
00:19:18,575 --> 00:19:20,702
She definitely does not.
(LAUGHING)

499
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:23,621
Sorry. I was just picturing her

500
00:19:23,705 --> 00:19:27,375
in my kumquat daisy dress
with reverse pattern hat.

501
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,460
It's good.

502
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:32,964
Oh, God, the corset.

503
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:34,591
So it's not a very good friend.

504
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:35,967
No, it is.

505
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:38,136
Sorry. (EXHALES)
Mm.

506
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,762
Sorry. I'm back.

507
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:41,347
- I missed you.
- You were saying?

508
00:19:41,431 --> 00:19:43,433
There's this new place.
It just opened.

509
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,435
I hear it's very welcoming

510
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,312
to a mixture
of different attires.

511
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:49,397
- It's right on...
- Wait.

512
00:19:51,399 --> 00:19:54,319
Go ahead. Oh, is it okay
if I write this down?

513
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:57,363
You're gonna have to eat
that paper later.

514
00:19:57,447 --> 00:19:58,656
A joke.

515
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,116
- It's right up...
- Wait.

516
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,368
You're not a cop, are you?

517
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:05,538
- This is Dior, too.
- Ooh.

518
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:07,498
- (LINE RINGING)
- He's not there.

519
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:09,375
He's there. Give him time.

520
00:20:09,459 --> 00:20:11,711
So far I've heard six rings
and zero answers.

521
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:13,074
WOMAN: Michael Kessler's office.

522
00:20:13,129 --> 00:20:14,672
Oh, great,
they decided to pick up.

523
00:20:14,756 --> 00:20:16,966
- Pardon?
- Y-Yes, hello.

524
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,551
Uh, can you hear me okay?

525
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:19,969
I can hear you fine.

526
00:20:20,053 --> 00:20:23,348
It's Abe Weissman
and Asher Friedman for Michael.

527
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:26,184
(STATICKY) Yes, well, Michael
is just on his way back from...

528
00:20:26,267 --> 00:20:28,478
- What?
- This thing of yours

529
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,164
- is not working.
- Could you repeat that?

530
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:32,065
This thing of yours
is not working!

531
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,608
Not you. Her.

532
00:20:33,691 --> 00:20:35,377
Michael is just coming
up the stairs. Hold, please.

533
00:20:35,401 --> 00:20:36,879
Oh, great,
now they've got us on hold.

534
00:20:36,903 --> 00:20:38,404
He's coming up the stairs.

535
00:20:38,488 --> 00:20:39,822
- Michael!
- KESSLER: What?

536
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:42,116
WOMAN: Abe Friedman
is on the phone for you!

537
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,035
She can't even get
the names right.

538
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:46,579
- KESSLER: Shit. Hold on, hold on. I'm coming.
- Oh, good.

539
00:20:46,663 --> 00:20:47,806
- He sounds very professional.
- (CAT MEOWS)

540
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:49,791
Is that a cat?
Does he have a cat?

541
00:20:49,874 --> 00:20:52,210
- ABE: Is he coming?
- WOMAN: Michael's coming. Michael!

542
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:54,712
KESSLER: I'm coming, geez!
Keep your pants on.

543
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:56,589
How long
is this fucking staircase?

544
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:57,840
Hello.

545
00:20:57,924 --> 00:20:59,550
Michael, it's Abe Weissman

546
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:01,010
- and Asher Friedman.
- Right.

547
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:02,679
- How are you?
- Peachy. How's your cat?

548
00:21:02,762 --> 00:21:05,223
- Good?
- Michael, last we spoke,

549
00:21:05,306 --> 00:21:06,557
you said you were going to talk

550
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:08,685
to someone
at the FBI field office.

551
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:10,353
Were you able to do that?

552
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:11,956
(STATICKY)
Yeah, yeah, I did, and I had

553
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:14,440
an incredibly productive
conversation with him.

554
00:21:14,524 --> 00:21:16,651
Abe, are you purposefully
trying to torture me?

555
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,861
- We didn't get that, Michael!
- (CAT MEOWS)

556
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:20,863
- Oh, Jesus Christ.
- I was saying

557
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:22,466
I spoke to the guy,
and I got good news.

558
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:24,909
They have nothing on you.
Nothing.

559
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:26,619
Some stuffed shirt
read your column

560
00:21:26,703 --> 00:21:28,639
and got his feathers ruffled
and kicked it down the chain,

561
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:29,664
but it's going nowhere.

562
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:30,790
- Really?
- Think about it.

563
00:21:30,873 --> 00:21:32,166
You broke
into a federal building

564
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,251
one night. Minor.

565
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:34,919
You lit a small fire. Bigger,

566
00:21:35,003 --> 00:21:36,879
but the damage was tiny,
and no one got hurt.

567
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:38,603
The next year,
they tore the building down

568
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:39,900
to build something new,
and everyone

569
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:40,985
who would give a shit is dead.

570
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:42,209
So this is a big, fat nothing.

571
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,511
It's a big, fat nothing.

572
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,572
They still want to meet
to get something on the record,

573
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,890
but you don't even have to do it
at an FBI office.

574
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:50,351
They'll come to you,
and it'll be over in a flash.

575
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:51,728
- (CAT MEOWS)
- Oh, my God.

576
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:53,646
Over? As in "over," over?

577
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,565
Over as in "forever."

578
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:57,316
- It's gonna be over.
- Forever!

579
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,068
Over forever!
I don't believe it!

580
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:01,072
- This is fantastic! (ASHER LAUGHS)
- (CAT MEOWS)

581
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:02,989
I love this cat!

582
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:05,074
(BOTH LAUGHING)

583
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,637
- (ROSE LAUGHS)
- Dorothy Parker never forgave you.

584
00:22:08,661 --> 00:22:10,472
- Oh, Dorothy Parker never knew who I was.
- (ABE LAUGHS)

585
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,373
Dorothy Parker
had a crush on you, Asher.

586
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:15,043
- You boasted about it.
- Well, she did follow me

587
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:16,794
into the men's room
at the Algonquin once,

588
00:22:16,878 --> 00:22:18,755
but that was before
the incident with the hat.

589
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,798
Asher was
a very good-looking young man.

590
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:23,801
Sort of
a barrel-chested strongman type.

591
00:22:23,885 --> 00:22:25,803
I used to lift weights
with Johnny Weissmuller.

592
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:27,638
Tarzan himself.
Is that meshuggeneh?

593
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:28,722
Hey, don't hold out.

594
00:22:28,765 --> 00:22:30,308
What happened
to Dorothy Parker's hat?

595
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:33,102
- (SIGHS) I sat on it.
- Oh, dear.

596
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:35,938
Second time at the round table,
I sat, I listened,

597
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:37,273
they said clever things.

598
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:38,733
An hour later, I stood,

599
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:40,735
and the damn hat
is stuck to my ass.

600
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:42,904
- (ALL LAUGH)
- So, Dorothy sizes me up

601
00:22:42,987 --> 00:22:44,322
and says, "A poem.

602
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:46,449
Today I entered with a hat.

603
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:49,243
And now it sits
where someone shat."

604
00:22:49,327 --> 00:22:51,913
- (ALL LAUGH)
- Crazy, the things that happen,

605
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:54,600
- that I've been through.
- How about our short, unsuccessful stint

606
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:56,000
as furniture movers, Asher?

607
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:57,460
Oh. That piano.

608
00:22:57,543 --> 00:22:59,337
How we thought
we could move a piano.

609
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:01,297
Up a flight of stairs.
A baby grand.

610
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,840
- Oh, my God.
- I remember this.

611
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:04,217
Two hours to get it up,

612
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,385
ten seconds to watch it
tumble down the stairs

613
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:07,887
and land on a squirrel

614
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:09,555
- on Bank Street. Ooh.
- ABE: Oh, God.

615
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:13,142
- What was that? Spring of '27?
- Uh, fall, I think.

616
00:23:13,226 --> 00:23:15,937
I was in the thick of my work
at Columbia.

617
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:17,855
It may even have been late '26.

618
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:19,357
No. No, it had to be '27,

619
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,210
because that's when Rosie and I
were seeing each other.

620
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:22,902
I'm sorry. One more time?

621
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:24,105
ROSE: More ancient history.

622
00:23:24,153 --> 00:23:25,506
ASHER: She showed up
for our first date

623
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,156
with that Louise Brooks haircut.

624
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,616
Remember? With the bangs?

625
00:23:28,699 --> 00:23:29,784
- Unfortunately.
- ABE: Ah,

626
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:31,452
I remember that haircut, too.

627
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:33,037
MIDGE: I'm sorry, hold on.

628
00:23:33,121 --> 00:23:35,748
You two went out together?
And you had bangs?

629
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:37,458
Oh, it was all so long ago.

630
00:23:37,542 --> 00:23:38,751
Where were you, Papa?

631
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:40,795
I was dating Tarzan at the time.

632
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:42,880
- (ROSE, ASHER AND ABE LAUGH)
- Wait. Wait, wait.

633
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:44,590
Was this before you two
were together?

634
00:23:44,674 --> 00:23:46,509
- It was in between.
- In between?

635
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,928
- You-you had an intermission?
- We broke up for a while.

636
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,221
You did?

637
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:52,140
I made a young man's mistake

638
00:23:52,223 --> 00:23:53,742
and told your mother
I couldn't see her

639
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:56,269
because I needed to focus
on my PhD.

640
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:58,432
Who could focus when you're
with the beautiful Rosie?

641
00:23:58,479 --> 00:23:59,772
- Oh, stop.
- (ASHER CHUCKLES)

642
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:01,041
We went together,
what, one month?

643
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:02,417
- Two months?
- ROSE: Somewhere in there.

644
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,442
And you knew?

645
00:24:03,526 --> 00:24:04,846
ROSE: I had to tell him
20 times,

646
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:06,279
but he finally seemed
to hear me.

647
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:07,464
ASHER: And by then,
I had gotten back together

648
00:24:07,488 --> 00:24:09,490
with Delores. Wife number one.

649
00:24:09,574 --> 00:24:11,576
I was not as lucky
as Abe and Rosie,

650
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,929
- that's for sure.
- ABE: I'll grab us another bottle of wine.

651
00:24:13,953 --> 00:24:15,305
- ASHER: Mm.
- Then I want to hear more

652
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:16,914
about that fling you had
with Tarzan.

653
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:19,792
(CHUCKLES)
It was a crazy time, the '20s.

654
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:21,294
Everyone went out with everyone.

655
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:23,629
Carol went out with John,
who went out with Martha,

656
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:26,275
who went out with Abigail.
No one could keep track. (ASHER CHUCKLES)

657
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:27,967
- That's for sure.
- (ABE LAUGHS)

658
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,386
ROSE: Who did Delores marry
after you, Asher?

659
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,656
- ASHER: John Barrymore.
- ROSE: I knew it was someone famous.

660
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,700
- MIDGE: Really?
- ASHER: I went to their wedding.

661
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:37,059
- I outdrank John.
- ROSE: What was that wedding like?

662
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:38,769
ASHER: Big. Expensive.

663
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:40,956
And then they got divorced.
She married her obstetrician.

664
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,481
Her obstetrician?

665
00:24:42,565 --> 00:24:45,026
- MIDGE: Guess the man liked what he saw.
- (LAUGHS)

666
00:24:45,109 --> 00:24:47,111
- Our last bottle.
- MIDGE: Mmm.

667
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:49,947
Then we break into
Rose's sherry stash.

668
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:52,909
ASHER: You know, I-I just might
change my train ticket

669
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:55,036
and stay another day or two
if that's okay.

670
00:24:55,119 --> 00:24:56,913
- Fine by me.
- Oh, please do, Asher.

671
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:59,373
I'd love to visit some
of my places in the Village,

672
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:00,833
hit my old haunts.

673
00:25:00,917 --> 00:25:03,211
- It's been a long time.
- ROSE: It's changed some.

674
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:06,756
This is the place?

675
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:08,716
- This is the place.
- Big.

676
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,676
- Big and airy.
- It needs a spruce.

677
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,595
But try to look beyond the dirt.

678
00:25:12,678 --> 00:25:16,224
It's got nice northern exposure,
a classic view.

Great. Bye.

I banned Boise
from the dressing room.

00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,184
There's a knock policy now.

856
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:36,395
Boys knock
because girls have knockers.

857
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:38,439
I know. Save it for the stage,
but you know.

- Payday. Payday.
- What?

859
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,359
Ah, geez, the both of you.

860
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:44,504
- The day you reach into your little cash box.
- Okay, okay.

861
00:31:44,528 --> 00:31:45,880
- And you hand me the money.
- I got it.

862
00:31:45,904 --> 00:31:47,239
- That you owe me.
- I'm doing it.

- Top drawer. Right side.
- Mm-hmm.

- I know where the box is.
- Under the keys.

It's my drawer.
I know what's in my drawer.

of those is for, huh?

All of them.

00:33:11,949 --> 00:33:14,410
And how? Laundry.

- Shh, shh, shh.
- Because laundry is the diary of your day.

they can smell Lucy,

898

899
00:33:22,126 --> 00:33:23,752
They can smell the horse track.

00:33:23,836 --> 00:33:26,630
The cigars with the boys.
The cigars with Lucy.

901
00:33:26,714 --> 00:33:30,134
And they can definitely
smell this place.

902
00:33:30,217 --> 00:33:32,594
Plus they go through your pants
and wallets at night

903

They just pretend they don't.
And why?

906
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:42,062
Because they've got
their own secret lives.

your wife has a life

good one when you left

- Agent Webber.
- Yes, thank you.

00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,861
I live six blocks away,
so I get to walk home tonight.

945

- Good deal.
- Excuse me, can I get anything else for anybody?

00:35:17,449 --> 00:35:19,385
By the time you brew it, I'll
be gone, but thank you, ma'am.

Yes, thanks, Rosie. (CHUCKLES)

WEBBER: Now, gentlemen,
let me remind you both

950
00:35:23,997 --> 00:35:25,249
that you're under oath.

951
00:35:25,332 --> 00:35:27,334
Yes, sir.

952
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:31,046
That's Abe's way
of saying, "Got it."

953
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:32,798
WEBBER: Then let's proceed.

954
00:35:32,881 --> 00:35:34,521
So, some years ago,
there was an incident.

955
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:36,176
And it hit our files.

956
00:35:36,260 --> 00:35:38,095
Careful with that, it's a relic.

957
00:35:38,178 --> 00:35:40,764
And Mr. Weissman recently wrote

958
00:35:40,848 --> 00:35:42,724
about this incident
in The Village Voice.

959
00:35:42,808 --> 00:35:45,519
And it implicated the two
of you, but I am here today

960
00:35:45,602 --> 00:35:48,355
to see what we can do to close
this matter. Mr. Kessler?

961
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:51,233
Thank you. For the record,
we've got two young men

962
00:35:51,316 --> 00:35:53,777
of a bygone era...
Activists, patriots...

963
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:57,197
Who walk into a federal
building, admittedly uninvited,

964
00:35:57,281 --> 00:35:59,741
they cause a little mischief,
then leave

965
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:01,743
without harming a fly.
Those are the facts.

966
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:03,662
Now, hold on,
since we're under oath,

967
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:06,039
no fly was harmed,
but a water bug...

968
00:36:06,123 --> 00:36:07,916
(SPUTTERS)
...got it pretty good.

Ah, this all seems
very open and shut.

971
00:36:14,256 --> 00:36:15,841
No harm, no foul.

972
00:36:15,924 --> 00:36:17,801
I believe I already have
more than enough here

973
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:20,846
- to report back to D.C. that...
- Asher walked into the building.

974
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,931
I'm sorry, uh, what?

975
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:24,975
Asher walked into the building.

976
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:27,352
I didn't go inside the building.

977
00:36:27,436 --> 00:36:29,187
I stayed outside.

978
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:31,082
We don't need to Martha Graham
this whole thing, right?

979
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:33,150
With the precise choreography?

980
00:36:33,233 --> 00:36:35,027
I'm under oath,
so I'm being accurate.

981
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,695
Asher walked into the building.

982
00:36:36,778 --> 00:36:39,239
Asher lit the fire,
Asher committed arson.

983
00:36:39,323 --> 00:36:41,325
- Look, gentlemen...
- Abe, what are you doing?

984
00:36:41,408 --> 00:36:43,410
I'm telling the FBI
what happened.

985
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:45,412
You walked into the building...

986
00:36:45,495 --> 00:36:47,915
And you stood lookout, which
makes you just as culpable.

987
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:49,833
I didn't know he was going in

988
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:52,127
to commit an act of arson.
You should write that down.

989
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,254
Well, why did you think
I was going in?

990
00:36:54,338 --> 00:36:56,214
To admire the portrait
of Warren G. Harding?

991
00:36:56,298 --> 00:36:58,592
Whoa, whoa!
Guys, guys, slow down!

992
00:36:58,675 --> 00:37:01,678
Old friends.
Old, cranky, loquacious friends.

993
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:03,931
He also vandalized
the stock exchange in 1923.

994
00:37:04,014 --> 00:37:05,390
Is that in your files?

995
00:37:05,474 --> 00:37:06,975
ASHER: Abe, what the fuck?!

996
00:37:07,059 --> 00:37:09,311
Just him, not me. You really
should write this down.

997
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:11,355
- I'm gonna need a pen.
- You do not need a pen.

998
00:37:11,438 --> 00:37:13,482
In fact, Agent Webber,
can we speak in private?

999
00:37:13,565 --> 00:37:15,859
I have some background
information that may help here.

1000
00:37:15,943 --> 00:37:17,402
Sure. Should I bring a pen?

1001
00:37:17,486 --> 00:37:19,112
Do not bring a pen.

1002

(DOOR CLOSES)

1003
00:37:25,994 --> 00:37:28,455
- Why?
- Why?

1004
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:30,457
I heard yelling. What happened?

1005
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:32,542
How long did you two go out?

1006
00:37:32,626 --> 00:37:33,835
What are you talking about?

1007
00:37:33,919 --> 00:37:35,379
You and Rosie. How long?

1008
00:37:35,462 --> 00:37:36,797
ASHER: Oh, no.

1009
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,132
Do not tell me that
this is what it's about.

1010
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:40,884
I want to know how long
my alleged wife

1011
00:37:40,968 --> 00:37:42,594
went out
with my alleged best friend.

1012
00:37:42,678 --> 00:37:44,513
Abe, I told you
I went out with Asher.

1013
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,056
- You did not.
- I did!

1014
00:37:46,139 --> 00:37:47,891
20 times, at least!

1015
00:37:47,975 --> 00:37:50,686
Rose, I admit that sometimes
I don't listen to you,

1016
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:53,897
but this time,
I was listening to you

1017
00:37:53,981 --> 00:37:56,900
when you did not tell me that
you schtupped my best friend.

1018
00:37:56,984 --> 00:37:58,485
- Abe!
- I'm sorry.

1019
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,696
So you're selling me out
to the FBI

1020
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:03,198
because Rosie and I
went out a few times?

1021
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,760
A few times? The other day, it
was two months. How long was it?

1022
00:38:05,784 --> 00:38:08,870
It was 35 years ago...
Who cares?!

1023
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:11,206
And you, you with your,
"He was so good-looking

1024
00:38:11,289 --> 00:38:12,558
when he was young."
Is there anything else

1025
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:13,875
you want to tell me about?

1026
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,961
Abe Weissman,
you're being irrational.

1027
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:17,879
What parts of this woman's
body did you touch?

1028
00:38:17,963 --> 00:38:19,047
- Abe!
- What?

1029
00:38:19,131 --> 00:38:21,133
What parts? Because
I want to mark them off,

1030
00:38:21,216 --> 00:38:22,819
and I am never going
to touch those parts again.

1031
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:25,137
Are you hearing yourself?

1032
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,972
I have just the right chalk.

1033
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:28,724
Long lasting, doesn't erase.

1034
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:29,975
Abe...

1035
00:38:30,058 --> 00:38:31,518

1037
00:38:33,854 --> 00:38:36,189
You are out
of your fucking mind!

1038
00:38:36,273 --> 00:38:38,734
Abe! Did he just lock
himself in his room?

1039
00:38:38,817 --> 00:38:42,696
Abe, may I remind you
that you broke up with me.

1040
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:46,408
ABE: Rose, may I remind you
that I was working on my PhD,

1041
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:50,120
and I told you that when it was
complete, I might come back!

1042
00:38:50,203 --> 00:38:53,623
I was very upfront
and sincere about that.

1043
00:38:53,707 --> 00:38:55,459
Asher,
I'm very sorry about this.

1044
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:57,169
Abe is completely out of line.

1045
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:59,379
ASHER: Oh, good, he's back.

1046
00:38:59,463 --> 00:39:01,798
I could have schtupped Delores.

1047
00:39:01,882 --> 00:39:04,259
- What?
- Yeah, while you and Rose

1048
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:06,762
and her Louise Brooks
harlot hair were catting about,

1049
00:39:06,845 --> 00:39:09,848
Delores made it very clear
that she wanted me badly.

1050
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:13,101
Delores wanted everybody, Abe!

1051
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:16,271
Eugene O'Neill, Aaron Copland,

1052
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,774

1054
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,487
What?

1055
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,489
I just had an idea for a play.

1056
00:39:25,572 --> 00:39:27,616
- What?
- It's the best idea

1057
00:39:27,699 --> 00:39:28,979
for a play I've had in 20 years.

1058
00:39:29,034 --> 00:39:30,911
I-I see it.

1059
00:39:30,994 --> 00:39:33,121
I see the arc
of the whole thing.

1060
00:39:33,205 --> 00:39:35,040
- I got to write this down.
- Asher,

1061
00:39:35,123 --> 00:39:37,250
do not write a play about this!

1062
00:39:37,334 --> 00:39:39,544
- I need a pen!
- Do not get a pen!

1063
00:39:39,628 --> 00:39:42,047
(LAUGHS) Up yours, Abe!

1064
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,007
If you get a pen
and write a play,

1065
00:39:44,091 --> 00:39:45,509
I'll destroy it in The Voice.

1066
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:47,052
I will! I'll do that!

1067
00:39:47,135 --> 00:39:48,845
I have no doubt.

1068
00:39:48,929 --> 00:39:50,639
Goodbye, Abe.

1069
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:52,766
Last word of advice,
writer to writer.

1070
00:39:52,849 --> 00:39:55,811
You over-use "quite,"
and "thusly" is a stupid word.

1071
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,646
Fuck you, don't call me again.

1072
00:39:57,729 --> 00:40:00,023
And please throw out
that weird chalk of yours.

1074
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,986
Goodbye.

1075
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:07,197
Your Louise Brooks
was a knockout.

1076
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,783
Don't you tell Rosie that
her fad hairdo was a knockout!

a ring in a glass.

Great. But he gave me two,

I mean, how are we supposed

her finger look too fat?

- I do.
- Martini up with olives?

- Why would he tell me?

- You told our five-year-old son

to tell me you're working
at a strip club?

- Yes, he forgot.

a number for him.

what about my career?

00:41:49,257 --> 00:41:51,968
- This is part of my career.
- Okay.

1122

- What?
- I'm not gonna say anything.

00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:55,364
Then don't say you're not
gonna say anything,

just seems like a step back.

1133
00:42:12,530 --> 00:42:14,091
No, I have not been
talking to Susie, why?

1134
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:16,534
Because you're saying exactly
the same things Susie says.

right about this.

You don't have a chair.

1190
00:44:51,815 --> 00:44:54,776
I can't sit
if you don't have a chair.

1191
00:44:54,859 --> 00:44:56,861
You don't seem to care.

1192
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:05,161
I'll hold it so it won't fall
on you on the way out.

1193
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:08,248
For the first time in 30 years,

1194
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:10,583
I can't get any work.

1195
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:13,002
No venue in this country
will book me anymore.

1196
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:14,504
Not even Phoenix.

1197
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:18,633
Not that I can stomach
going back on the road again.

1198
00:45:18,716 --> 00:45:21,970
I'm financially overextended,
meaning

1199
00:45:22,053 --> 00:45:24,597
I have more expenses
than money to cover them.

1200
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:26,534
- Yeah, I know what overextended means.
- Well, you're

1201
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:28,476
so quiet over there,
so I wasn't sure.

1202
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:30,770
My business manager said

1203
00:45:30,854 --> 00:45:32,814
my lifestyle needs to change.

1204
00:45:32,897 --> 00:45:34,983
And then he quit.

1205
00:45:35,066 --> 00:45:36,985
So that's a change.

1206
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,988
(SIGHS) My dogs
won't eat canned food.

1207
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:41,823
Even though it's not that bad.

1208
00:45:41,906 --> 00:45:43,241
What do you want, Lucille?

1209
00:45:44,325 --> 00:45:45,827
Don't you want
to know how I know

1210
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:48,621
- the dog food's not that bad?
- Nope.

1211
00:45:48,705 --> 00:45:51,541
There's a brand-new
NBC game show.

1212
00:45:51,624 --> 00:45:54,752
They're looking for a host,
and I want it.

1213
00:45:54,836 --> 00:45:57,297
It's perfect for me.
I'd be great at it.

1214
00:45:57,380 --> 00:45:59,799
But the network
won't even meet with me.

1215
00:45:59,883 --> 00:46:01,551
I'd audition, I'd test.

1216
00:46:01,634 --> 00:46:04,220
Whatever they want.
But they won't even consider it.

1217
00:46:04,304 --> 00:46:06,264
I called Harry a hundred times.

1218
00:46:06,347 --> 00:46:08,266
He won't take my calls.

1219
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:10,018
I even went to his office once.

1220
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:12,479
They said he was golfing.
It was raining out.

1221
00:46:12,562 --> 00:46:15,523
Plus he walked right by me,
so I know they were lying.

1222
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:18,234
That's terrible. Kind of like
you've been blackballed.

1223
00:46:18,318 --> 00:46:19,861
Yes.

1224
00:46:19,944 --> 00:46:21,130
It doesn't feel good, does it?

1225
00:46:21,154 --> 00:46:22,530
No.

1226
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:24,157
Doesn't feel good at all.

1227
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:27,327
Well, I'm sorry, Soph,
our paths have diverged.

1228
00:46:27,410 --> 00:46:28,888
That means your path went one
way and my path went another.

1229
00:46:28,912 --> 00:46:31,414
I know what diverged means.

1230
00:46:31,498 --> 00:46:34,250
Okay, well, seeing
as how our paths have diverged,

1231
00:46:34,334 --> 00:46:37,504
I think it's best that we...
You and me...

1232
00:46:37,587 --> 00:46:39,923
We stay, you know... diverged.

1233
00:46:40,006 --> 00:46:41,508
You didn't finish
very strong there.

1234
00:46:41,591 --> 00:46:43,801
Fuck you. Let me fix my desk.

1235
00:46:43,885 --> 00:46:45,845
What if I were to apologize?

1236
00:46:45,929 --> 00:46:48,073
I got enough to clean up here
without your head exploding.

1237
00:46:48,097 --> 00:46:50,183
You put my show on Broadway.

1238
00:46:50,266 --> 00:46:53,102
You did that.
No one else even tried.

1239
00:46:53,186 --> 00:46:55,271
Look, Sophie,
I am sorry about the game show.

1240
00:46:55,355 --> 00:46:57,357
I just don't know
what I could do.

1241
00:46:58,983 --> 00:47:01,653
Well, if you happen
to think of anything...

1242
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:05,240
...I'd be very grateful.

You got Dawes driving you home?

1245
00:47:11,287 --> 00:47:13,289
Dawes left.

1246
00:47:14,791 --> 00:47:16,793
Shit.

1247
00:47:25,969 --> 00:47:27,095
Hey.

1248
00:47:28,972 --> 00:47:30,598
If I do this... help you...

1249
00:47:30,682 --> 00:47:32,392
You got to fucking agree
to lose my number.

1250
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:35,061
- I promise. (EXHALES)

(GASPS) Wonderful.

I hope it's been a night
you will never forget.

You've been a great audience,
please get home safe.

1262

Don't forget
to tip the waitresses.
