1
00:00:07,007 --> 00:00:09,218
So, you want to be a secretary
for a talent manager.

2
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:11,762
- Yes. Very much.
- Great.

3
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:14,765
You're up.

4
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:16,726
- Excuse me?
- Go ahead. I'm all ears.

5
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:19,729
Oh. Well,
what would you like to know?

6
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:22,732
Give me a minute.

7
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:32,450
Do you have a natural flair
for meticulous organization?

8
00:00:32,533 --> 00:00:33,868
I'd say yes. Yes, I do.

9
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:35,953
Great.

10
00:00:38,914 --> 00:00:40,916
You excuse me again?

11
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:49,800
Can you always be depended upon
to do what you say you'll do?

12
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,052
- Yes, certainly.
- Fantastic.

13
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:55,848
Perhaps you'd like
to see my résumé?

14
00:00:55,931 --> 00:00:58,476
Excellent, yes,
let's take a gander.

15
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,478
Three pages, huh?

16
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:01,645
Mm-hmm.

17
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:04,064
Come on. Some of this is
bullshit, right?

18
00:01:04,148 --> 00:01:05,483
Then I went
to Brooklyn College,

19
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:07,002
where I got my B.A.
in English literature.

20
00:01:07,026 --> 00:01:08,611
Very good.

21
00:01:08,694 --> 00:01:11,530
And... why do you want
to work here?

22
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:13,534
Many reasons. But first
and foremost, I'm excited

23
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:15,427
to get in on the ground floor
of a growing business.

24
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:16,911
Growing business.

25
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:19,914
Okay, that's putting
a shit-ton of pressure on me.

26
00:01:19,997 --> 00:01:22,082
Do you have any questions
you'd like to ask me?

27
00:01:22,166 --> 00:01:24,627
Um, what will
a typical workday look like?

28
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,088
Will you excuse me a minute?

29
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:30,650
Every one of these broads,
they can type,

30
00:01:30,674 --> 00:01:33,844
they graduated from someplace,
they sit nice.

31
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:36,388
I got this book with questions
to ask. It's no fucking help.

32
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:37,973
All the girls give
the same answer,

33
00:01:38,057 --> 00:01:39,993
because they all probably got
a fucking book, too.

34
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:41,393
You ever hire anybody?

35
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:42,788
- Sure, lots of people.
<i>- Well, what kind of stuff</i>

36
00:01:42,812 --> 00:01:44,080
<i>do you ask,
so you know who to pick?</i>

37
00:01:44,104 --> 00:01:45,940
That depends.
You got to tailor the questions

38
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:47,107
to the specific job.

39
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:48,400
Yeah. How, Fred? How?

40
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:50,402
Well, when I hired a guy
to paint my apartment,

41
00:01:50,486 --> 00:01:52,655
- I asked if he had a ten-foot ladder.
<i>- Okay.</i>

42
00:01:52,738 --> 00:01:54,949
But I didn't ask that
when I hired my tax guy

43
00:01:55,032 --> 00:01:57,201
<i>or the girl to get my brother
laid after his divorce.</i>

44
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,869
<i>You don't need a ladder
for those jobs.</i>

45
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:01,497
Fred, did you ever hire anybody
at William Morris

46
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,916
in a professional,
show-business capacity?

47
00:02:03,999 --> 00:02:05,000
Not per se.

48
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:06,252
- I'm hanging up.
<i>- Wait.</i>

49
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,546
You should definitely see
how the person chews.

50
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:10,172
<i>- What?</i>
- I'm serious.

51
00:02:10,256 --> 00:02:12,192
You're going to be in
close quarters with this girl,

52
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:15,052
with snacks and whatnot,
munching and crunching,

53
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,262
<i>day in, day out.</i>

54
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:19,014
<i>If they chew loud,
you're doomed.</i>

55
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:21,201
My shorthand is excellent,
and I type 70 words per minute.

56
00:02:21,225 --> 00:02:23,185
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm friendly but I'm firm.

57
00:02:23,269 --> 00:02:25,229
Your time is precious,
and I'll be the gatekeeper.

58
00:02:25,312 --> 00:02:27,273
There will be
no unwarranted interruptions.

59
00:02:27,356 --> 00:02:28,899
Yes, that is all
very interesting.

60
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,359
Very interesting.

61
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:32,319
Hey, you hungry?

62
00:02:32,403 --> 00:02:34,673
- Uh, no, not really.
- 'Cause I was about to eat this, but now...

63
00:02:34,697 --> 00:02:35,865
why don't you have it?

64
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:37,449
Thank you, no, I just had lunch.

65
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:38,969
I'll cut it up for you.
I got a pocketknife.

66
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:40,273
That's very nice,
but really, no.

67
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,647
Oh, come on,
it's nice and crispy.

68
00:02:41,704 --> 00:02:43,184
To be honest,
I'm actually allergic...

69
00:02:43,247 --> 00:02:44,748
Eat the fucking apple!

70
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:10,983
- Papa, are you up?
- Who is it?

71
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:12,318
It's me, Abe.

72
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,153
It's not you.

73
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:17,698
- Stop that, please.
- It's not me.

74
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,074
Did I wake you?

75
00:03:19,158 --> 00:03:20,951
Sorry,
I figured you'd be reading.

76
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:22,953
Your mother made me
turn out my light.

77
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:24,371
Now, what is it?

78
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:26,457
I need some help,
but I'll ask you tomorrow.

79
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,083
No, it's fine.
I was just lying there

80
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:30,127
thinking about how she made me
turn out my light.

81
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,171
I just can't get my checkbook
to balance,

82
00:03:32,254 --> 00:03:34,423
- and it's driving me crazy.
- What's going on?

83
00:03:34,506 --> 00:03:36,226
Nothing. Miriam can't balance
her checkbook.

84
00:03:36,258 --> 00:03:38,135
Why on earth
would you have her doing that

85
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,572
- in the middle of the night, Abe?
- I live in a Dr. Seuss book.

86
00:03:40,596 --> 00:03:42,356
I'm sorry I got you up.
Back to bed, you two.

87
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,492
- Night night.
- I can't sleep when your father's just lying there

88
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,436
thinking about how I made him
turn out the light.

89
00:03:46,477 --> 00:03:48,747
- Then let me turn on my light.
- Fine, I'll sleep on the couch.

90
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:51,148
Do not sleep on the couch.
It wears out the cushions faster

91
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:55,319
- than just everyday sitting.
- Then I'm going back to bed.

92
00:03:55,402 --> 00:03:57,279
Where's the checkbook?

93
00:03:57,363 --> 00:03:58,822
In the kitchen.

94
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:00,866
It's been weeks.
You have to stop fighting.

95
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:02,826
Who's fighting?
I'm simply recalibrating

96
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,912
my entire relationship
with your mother

97
00:04:04,995 --> 00:04:07,195
based on information she
previously chose to keep secret

98
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:08,582
for 35 years.

99
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:11,210
Okay. Could you stop that, then?

100
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:13,212
It comes out different
every time.

101
00:04:13,295 --> 00:04:15,673
- Always terrible but never the same.
- Ugh.

102
00:04:16,757 --> 00:04:18,133
What's this?

103
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:20,177
Is it better if it's a one
or a seven?

104
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,054
It's less bad if it's a seven.

105
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,722
Call it a seven.

106
00:04:23,806 --> 00:04:25,766
And this is
what you're getting paid

107
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,893
for selling
all that Tupperware?

108
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:30,270
It's no way to get rich,
but I did win an aquarium.

109
00:04:30,354 --> 00:04:33,065
Which has been surprisingly
expensive to maintain.

110
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:36,276
I sold the most pastel
Wonderliers in my region.

111
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,446
- Mm-hmm.
- I also won those toasters and a salad spinner.

112
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,370
And surely you've seen
the two large dalmatians

113
00:04:41,448 --> 00:04:42,866
in our living room.

114
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:46,996
Do you think Joel could try
to contribute a little more?

115
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,456
He's doing
everything he can, Papa.

116
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,708
Well...

117
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,627
There's your balance.

118
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:56,046
Uh, that's if the number was
a seven.

119
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:58,632
And that's if it was a one.

120
00:04:58,716 --> 00:05:01,218
I think even Ethan
could have helped you.

121
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:05,055
Thanks, Papa. Really.

122
00:05:05,139 --> 00:05:07,725
Could I bring my book in here
and read?

123
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:09,476
Sure.

124
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:12,104
I'll forgive your mother
in the morning.

125
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:14,982
For God's sake, the woman owns
a Chanel sleep mask.

126
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,290
Looks like it's gonna be
four debates.

127
00:05:31,373 --> 00:05:32,708
Kennedy-Nixon?

128
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:34,251
- He's such a creep.
- Which one?

129
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,295
Nixon. Mei.

130
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:37,629
They both have skeletons.

131
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:38,857
You are not voting for Nixon.

132
00:05:38,881 --> 00:05:40,507
I am not voting for Nixon.

133
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:41,884
He looks like he eats children.

134
00:05:41,967 --> 00:05:43,153
Thank you.

135
00:05:43,177 --> 00:05:44,386
Ethan wants

136
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:46,221
one of these
Etch A Sketch things,

137
00:05:46,305 --> 00:05:48,682
but they're $2.99, and he'll
break it in, like, a day.

138
00:05:48,766 --> 00:05:50,243
What's an Etch A Sketch?

139
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,995
You draw on the screen with the knobs,

140
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:54,897
- then you shake it, and the picture erases.
- What's the point of that?

141
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:57,608
To teach kids that nothing lasts.

142
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:58,942
- Joel!
- What?

143
00:05:59,026 --> 00:06:00,611
You're not even gonna answer
the door?

144
00:06:00,694 --> 00:06:02,071
- Nah.
- Come on!

145
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:03,697
We discussed this.

146
00:06:03,781 --> 00:06:05,574
It could be another one
of Ma's girls.

147
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:08,660
- If I open it, I'm as good as engaged.
- It could be a delivery.

148
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:10,096
- They'll leave it.
- Someone could steal it.

149
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,288
Nothing lasts.

150
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,289
What do you do at the club?

151
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,457
- Shh.
- Why?

152
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,084
In case they're listening
at the door.

153
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,294
If the phone rings at the club,
you have to answer it.

154
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,338
People want to come in,
you have to let them in.

155
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:21,423
There's a protocol for women
of childbearing age.

156
00:06:21,507 --> 00:06:23,667
If they want to talk to me,
Mrs. Moskowitz screens them

157
00:06:23,717 --> 00:06:25,219
with a series
of discreet questions.

158
00:06:25,302 --> 00:06:27,221
- Oh, my God.
- The system's worked for weeks.

159
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:29,264
- Why question it now?
- Because it's demented.

160
00:06:29,348 --> 00:06:30,891
Because it's...

161
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,601
Aah! I'll do it!

162
00:06:32,684 --> 00:06:34,269
- Do what?
- I'll meet your parents.

163
00:06:34,353 --> 00:06:35,479
Just answer the phone!

164
00:06:35,562 --> 00:06:37,940
- No. We can wait my mother out.
- We can't.

165
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:40,359
We can. She's getting older.
She has limited wind.

166
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:41,860
We need our lives back, Joel.

167
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:43,904
- My life is fine.
- Well, mine isn't.

168
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:45,489
This is dumb.
I mean, you said it.

169
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:48,033
We're in a... a...

170
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:49,868
Relationship.

171
00:06:49,952 --> 00:06:51,245
Yes. That. Sure.

172
00:06:51,328 --> 00:06:52,663
They have to know.

173
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,749
Make a date. End the madness.

174
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:56,917
I'll just move again.

175
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,752
A moving target
will confuse her.

176
00:07:03,173 --> 00:07:05,092
Set it up. Today.

177
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,136
I'll be at the movies.

178
00:07:10,472 --> 00:07:12,099
Just in case.

179
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:20,232
Susie? Oh. Sorry.

180
00:07:20,315 --> 00:07:22,109
I just need to talk to you
when you're done.

181
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:23,962
- No, now's a good time.
- Should I wait outside?

182
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:25,529
Nah. You ain't getting the job.

183
00:07:25,612 --> 00:07:27,865
- Oh. Okay, thank you.
- No. Thank you.

184
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:31,660
- What's with your phone?
- Nothing. Why?

185
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:34,705
- I've been calling all morning.
All you get is a busy signal. - Shit.

186
00:07:34,788 --> 00:07:36,915
You need a secretary.

187
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:38,083
What do you think that was?

188
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:39,877
What's up?

189
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,587
- This.
- What is that?

190
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:45,382
This is my invitation
to Shy Baldwin's wedding.

191
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,967
Why the fuck
would you be invited

192
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,094
- to Shy Baldwin's wedding?
- You tell me.

193
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:50,978
I don't know.
They're working off an old list?

194
00:07:51,054 --> 00:07:54,391
- Then you would've been invited.
- And I was not invited.

195
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:57,019
- Susie.
- I guess I was invited.

196
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:59,271
Why the hell was I invited
to Shy Baldwin's wedding?

197
00:07:59,354 --> 00:08:01,315
And it's three days from now.

198
00:08:01,398 --> 00:08:02,959
Basic wedding etiquette dictates
invitations go out

199
00:08:02,983 --> 00:08:05,068
45 days prior to the event,
at a minimum.

200
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,546
I'm sorry, you're offended
that you were invited

201
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,756
at the last minute to a
wedding you don't want to go to?

202
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,698
Yes. Who wouldn't be?

203
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:11,450
- Me.
- And not only am I not going,

204
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:13,243
I'm RSVPing "yes"
and then not going,

205
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:14,703
just to screw up his count.

206
00:08:14,786 --> 00:08:15,996
You're a monster.

207
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,165
That thing's a waste
of a nice gilded edge.

208
00:08:18,248 --> 00:08:20,709
You know what?
Maybe we should go.

209
00:08:20,792 --> 00:08:23,712
- Go? Are you kidding me?
- There's no way

210
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,505
there's not an open bar,
some good food.

211
00:08:25,589 --> 00:08:26,924
You are not serious.

212
00:08:27,007 --> 00:08:28,217
He kind of owes us, you know?

213
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,485
You could get
your picture taken there,

214
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,803
get some good exposure
and some good cake.

215
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:34,556
I am kind of curious to see
the whole spectacle.

216
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:37,559
And I am really curious
to drink a lot of free booze.

217
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:40,812
Did you see that?

218
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:42,481
- See what?
- So you didn't? - The smoke?

219
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,233
- So you did.
- I did.

220
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:46,235
- Damn. Damn it.
- Were we not supposed to?

221
00:08:46,318 --> 00:08:48,320
Of course you were,
but not then. Later.

222
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:50,989
It's no good! I can't...

223
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:52,532
What was I...
How am I supposed...

224
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,076
Breathe it out.

225
00:08:54,159 --> 00:08:56,954
It was on four, not three.
Just have to remember to count.

226
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,331
I'll just try it again.

227
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:05,585
I'm looking pretty good to you
right now, aren't I?

228
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:12,427
I got a net.
I should save for Ethan?

229
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:14,179
We have saying back home:

230
00:09:14,263 --> 00:09:17,724
"Never too early for child
to learn how to bury."

231
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:21,812
Mm. Let's just flush him and let
his memory be a blessing.

232
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,439
Do we have any matches, Zelda?
This is dangerous.

233
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:27,567
I saw Miss Miriam has matches
in her bedroom. I'll get them.

234
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:30,988
I'll get it, Zelda.

235
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:36,524
Weissman residence.

236
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,620
Mm, this is she.

237
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,125
Well, of course.

238
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,502
I'd be very happy to meet
with Mr. Melamid.

239
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:49,298
Certainly, any time he'd like.

240
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:51,591
Today's fine.

241
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:54,469
Half an hour.
I can be ready by then.

242
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:57,347
It's 385 Riverside Drive
in Manhattan.

243
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:58,640
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

244
00:09:58,724 --> 00:10:00,517
You're welcome. Thank you.

245
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,977
<i>Goodbye.</i>

246
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:06,690
As it turns out, I don't have
time for tea after all.

247
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:08,608
There's a car coming for me.

248
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:10,610
I have business in Scarsdale.

249
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:12,946
Please tell Mr. Weissman
when he comes home.

250
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:16,658
Okay, I'll tell him you went
outside to do your business.

251
00:10:17,743 --> 00:10:19,828
I'll just leave a note.

259
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:41,933
Mrs. Weissman.

260
00:10:42,017 --> 00:10:44,311
Solomon Melamid.

261
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,396
I'd, uh, shake your hand,
but mine is...

262
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,750
straight from the horse's mouth, shall we say.

263
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:50,359
- Anyway, welcome.
- Rose Weissman.

264
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:51,735
It's a pleasure.

265
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:53,278
Cut it out, Zephaniah.

266
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:54,905
Don't let him scare you.

267
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,148
Oh, it takes more than
a little showing off to do that.

268
00:10:57,199 --> 00:10:59,701
I grew up with horses.
In Oklahoma.

269
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:02,013
- And I see you wore sensible shoes.
- Well, there's nothing elegant

270
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:04,456
about landing on your backside
in the mud, is there?

271
00:11:04,539 --> 00:11:06,625
I can tell,
you know a thing or two.

272
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,043
Join me in a walk?

273
00:11:08,126 --> 00:11:09,753
Now, that...

274
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:10,837
Whoa, boy!

275
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:13,715
...is Copper Jack,
my prize stallion.

276
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:17,094
A stable boy walked a mare
past his stall this morning.

277
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:19,179
Poor devil got a whiff,
and he hasn't been able

278
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,890
- to calm himself since.
- Hmm. Your house, my goodness,

279
00:11:21,973 --> 00:11:24,976
it's even more stunning than
it looked in <i>Town & Country.</i>

280
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:27,229
My great-grandfather
had it built in 1840.

281
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:29,398
We throw on another wing
from time to time...

282
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:31,066
birthdays, Hanukkah.

283
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:33,068
Hmm, your family's
in the railroad business.

284
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:36,071
Railroad, shipping, steel.
We're eyeing aviation.

285
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,532
Innovation's key.
Stagnation is death.

286
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,534
You're a businesswoman;
you know all this.

287
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,786
Oh, yes, I am. I do.

288
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:44,621
Mrs. Weissman,
I wanted to meet you,

289
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:48,041
because your impressive match
for my lawyer's daughter

290
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:49,876
did not escape my notice.

291
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,711
Norma and Lorraine,
my two daughters,

292
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:54,047
are 31 and 32 years old.

293
00:11:54,131 --> 00:11:55,132
Oh!

294
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,175
- Uh, sorry.
- No, don't be.

295
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:59,177
Their mother cries herself
to sleep every night

296
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:00,887
wondering where she went wrong.

297
00:12:00,971 --> 00:12:02,806
Well, you've come
to the right place.

298
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,641
Trees with a few more rings
on them

299
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,601
happen to be
a specialty of mine.

300
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:07,686
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

301
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:08,854
That's good to hear.

302
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:11,874
I think we're gonna have
to give him Starlight

303
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,233
just to calm him down.

304
00:12:13,316 --> 00:12:15,444
Horses are easy.

305
00:12:15,527 --> 00:12:17,237
You throw them together,
a little noise,

306
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:20,490
maybe a stall door needs
repairing, and that's that.

307
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,701
If only it were as simple
with daughters.

308
00:12:22,784 --> 00:12:25,495
- Tell me about them, your girls.
- Well...

309
00:12:25,579 --> 00:12:27,497
Norma has a penchant
for stable boys.

310
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:29,708
- She's the Starlight of the family.
- I see.

311
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,871
Lorraine, the younger one,
she got kicked in the head

312
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:34,254
by a horse as a child,
so she's an easy mark.

313
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:36,715
We've had a lot of schemers
and gigolos who look at Lorraine

314
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,884
and see the goose that laid
the golden egg.

315
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,428
- She almost married an actor.
- Heavens.

316
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:44,973
I got him a job on the road
promoting Ford Thunderbirds.

317
00:12:45,056 --> 00:12:47,142
He's in Alaska as we speak.

318
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:49,436
But they aren't all
so easily disposed of.

319
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:51,480
You just need someone
to screen out the schemers

320
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:53,482
and find the man
who will love Lorraine

321
00:12:53,565 --> 00:12:55,609
for who she is
and not what she has.

322
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,819
And I need to be able
to bring my daughters' husbands

323
00:12:57,903 --> 00:12:59,988
into the family business.
They can't be idiots,

324
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:02,574
- or obvious idiots.
- Well, Mr. Melamid,

325
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:04,868
I assure you I can find
some very nice men

326
00:13:04,951 --> 00:13:06,536
who are not obviously idiots

327
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,997
and will make Norma and Lorraine
very happy.

328
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,207
Oh, yes.

329
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,125
Happy, that would be good, too.

330
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:14,503
Not a deal breaker,
but a nice bonus.

331
00:13:14,586 --> 00:13:16,630
Mrs. Weissman,
I am appointing you

332
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:20,175
director of the nearly bankrupt
division of Melamid Industries

333
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,552
known as my daughters'
marital prospects.

334
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,596
Good luck.
And if it's any incentive,

335
00:13:24,679 --> 00:13:28,391
the extended Melamid family
is large, rich and homely,

336
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:31,436
so there could be a lot of
Melamid matches in your future.

337
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:33,438
Well, then I'd better get
right to work.

338
00:13:33,522 --> 00:13:35,565
Where are
Norma and Lorraine now?

339
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:36,733
In the city.

340
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,503
They live together there
like a pair of ex-nuns.

341
00:13:38,527 --> 00:13:40,654
I'll set up meetings right away
to get to know them.

342
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:43,281
Please tell Mrs. Melamid
I said she should start thinking

343
00:13:43,365 --> 00:13:44,741
about the centerpieces.

344
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,159
One more thing.

345
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:48,161
Respectability is
of the utmost importance

346
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:49,496
to the Melamid family.

347
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:52,707
We value decency,
dignity and discretion,

348
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:55,877
and we assume you
and your family do as well.

349
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:58,547
- Yes, of course, Mr. Melamid.
- Good.

350
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:00,465
Call me Solomon.

351
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:01,841
John!

352
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:04,594
Send Edgar to give
Mrs. Weissman a tour.

353
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,221
Make sure you see the swans.

354
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,848
They are bastards
but they are beautiful.

355
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:18,567
Hello?

356
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,694
Is anybody home?

357
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,530
Miriam?

358
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,675
Ice cream,
get your ice cream here.

359
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:29,452
I got chocolate,
I got vanilla.

360
00:15:12,579 --> 00:15:15,665
<i>♪ Bop, bop, bop, bop,
ba-dop, bop, bop, bop, bop ♪</i>

361
00:15:15,749 --> 00:15:19,586
<i>♪ She was afraid
to come out of the locker ♪</i>

362
00:15:19,669 --> 00:15:23,506
<i>♪ She was as nervous
as she could be ♪</i>

363
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,342
<i>♪ She was afraid to come out...</i>

364
00:15:25,425 --> 00:15:28,261
- You're late.
- It's my chauffeur. He fired himself.

365
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,388
I had to take a cab.

366
00:15:30,472 --> 00:15:32,349
- Okay, so...
- Did you hear what I said?

367
00:15:32,432 --> 00:15:34,184
A taxicab.

368
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:37,562
Susie... I'm exhausted.

369
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:39,022
I had to hail it myself.

370
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,107
I had to put my arm
up in the air,

371
00:15:41,191 --> 00:15:44,444
I had to leave it there
until the cab pulled over.

372
00:15:44,527 --> 00:15:47,280
I had to open my own door.
I had to duck down...

373
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:49,324
It sounds harrowing,
but it's over. Now focus.

374
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:50,742
- Mm.
- Look over there.

375
00:15:50,825 --> 00:15:53,953
That is Mike Carr.
He books <i>The Gordon Ford Show.</i>

376
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:56,164
Hmm, not unattractive.

377
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,458
You are not gonna fuck him.
You're gonna meet with him.

378
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:00,502
Now, I got to make sure
you are ready for this.

379
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,337
Let me see your eyes.

380
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:04,315
Well, at least they're spinning
in the same direction.

381
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,257
Did you take your meds,
or stop taking them,

382
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:09,177
- whichever makes you less nuts?
- Yes, both.

383
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,429
Because if you screw this up,
all that's left for you

384
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:14,641
is to be my secretary,
and you'd be a lousy secretary.

385
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,142
Now, come on.

386
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:21,064
<i>♪ It was an itsy-bitsy,
teeny-weeny yellow polka-dot...</i>

387
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,941
Mike Carr? Susie Myerson.

388
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:24,859
Finally. I was about to leave.

389
00:16:24,943 --> 00:16:26,587
You would've missed out
on the meeting of a lifetime.

390
00:16:26,611 --> 00:16:29,155
When I went to a bullfight
with Hemingway,

391
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:30,949
that was the meeting
of a lifetime.

392
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:32,617
I don't know what the fuck
this is.

393
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:35,120
Then, let me introduce you
to the goddamn living legend,

394
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:36,913
Sophie Lennon. Sophie, Mike.

395
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:38,140
I started out with
ten minutes for you.

396
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:39,874
I waited seven,
so now I have three.

397
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,960
- I like him.
- Great. Sit.

398
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,797
Ooh!

399
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,006
You okay?

400
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,175
Have you ever taken a cab?

401
00:16:49,259 --> 00:16:50,719
Ignore her.

402
00:16:50,802 --> 00:16:52,512
Mike, when's your birthday?

403
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,764
Day before Christmas.
It's a fucking curse.

404
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:56,200
How would you like it
to be next week?

405
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,600
What's the angle here?

406
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,310
I thought you said no sex.

407
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,479
What I am offering you
today is a gift.

408
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:04,274
An unprecedented interview
with the great Sophie Lennon.

409
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:05,775
Unprecedented?

410
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:07,712
She's been on every goddamn
talk show in the country.

411
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:09,696
I have. I've been
on <i>Sullivan</i> nine times.

412
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,656
Yeah, I heard about
you being "on Sullivan."

413
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,450
He said he was leaving his wife.

414
00:17:13,533 --> 00:17:15,261
I am not talking about some
run-of-the-mill interview.

415
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:16,637
Is that what you think
Gordon does?

416
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,121
Run-of-the-mill interviews?

417
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,957
- Mike.
- Keep walking.

418
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,834
- Mike, listen...
- There's no heat on her.

419
00:17:22,917 --> 00:17:25,003
Okay? It'd be like booking
an iceberg, sorry.

420
00:17:25,086 --> 00:17:27,338
- And I accept your apology.
- Don't talk.

421
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,216
Mike, just listen to me.
This woman here,

422
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,843
she had a nervous breakdown.

423
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:33,446
- That's your pitch?
- She went from being

424
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,263
the highest-paid comedian
in this business

425
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:37,474
to a punch line herself
in one fucking night.

426
00:17:37,557 --> 00:17:38,975
Complete career suicide.

427
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,661
You telling me that story
doesn't interest you?

428
00:17:40,685 --> 00:17:42,966
Well, sure, but we can't talk
about that shit on the show.

429
00:17:43,021 --> 00:17:44,522
- Why not?
- Because you can't.

430
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:45,857
Who says?

431
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,276
I don't know, uh... America?

432
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:49,861
Fuck America.

433
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:51,756
You book Sophie on that show,
she will give Gordon

434
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:53,490
the kind of interview
no other star

435
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:55,283
in her right mind
would ever agree to.

436
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:57,243
I am not in my right mind,
that is true.

437
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:59,537
- She's got stories, Mike.
- So?

438
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:01,748
My mother has stories.
I wouldn't book her, either.

439
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:04,125
Who'd you have
on the show last night, Mike?

440
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:06,586
Let me answer that...
a blonde starlet

441
00:18:06,669 --> 00:18:08,379
and a boring-ass director.

442
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,107
The night before that,
a red-headed starlet

443
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,716
and a boring-ass novelist.

444
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,635
And they're all
plugging something.

445
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:15,918
They talk about their shitty
movie or their boring book,

446
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,264
how everyone they work with
is a genius

447
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,517
and how everybody in Hollywood
is best friends.

448
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,811
And maybe they throw in
a semi-embarrassing story

449
00:18:22,894 --> 00:18:24,604
about getting locked
out of their house,

450
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:26,272
wearing only a towel,
then you go

451
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:27,833
to a commercial,
sell some cigarettes.

452
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:30,109
Well, Sophie Lennon has
fuck-all to plug.

453
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:31,986
She's got nothing to lose.

454
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,406
So she is gonna open up
her walk-in closet of skeletons

455
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:38,660
and introduce them all
to the world in living color.

456
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:40,137
And her publicist
isn't gonna stop her

457
00:18:40,161 --> 00:18:41,579
'cause her publicist
quit last week.

458
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:43,915
It's risky.

459
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,838
If it's a disaster,
I'm the one that goes down.

460
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,169
Gordon's been stuck at
number two since the beginning.

461
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:50,380
He does something ballsy
like this?

462
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,173
He's number one
and you're the one

463
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:53,842
who made him number one.

464
00:18:53,925 --> 00:18:55,677
If it doesn't work, sure,
it's your ass.

465
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,388
But if he stays number two,
aren't you getting fired anyway?

466
00:18:59,848 --> 00:19:01,307
Give me a card.

467
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:03,184
Got one right here.

468
00:19:03,268 --> 00:19:05,562
Uh, wait, I got a...
new number.

469
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:10,316
And the printer fucked up.
There's no "Q" in "Myerson."

470
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,402
Stay by your phone.

471
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:16,865
Did that go well or badly?

472
00:19:16,948 --> 00:19:19,325
I do not think you're gonna need
to be my secretary.

473
00:19:53,067 --> 00:19:55,111
What would you like to drink?

474
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,030
Very cold water, please.

475
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:58,865
You get water,
I still have to charge you.

476
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,658
And there's a two-drink minimum.

477
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:03,369
Water... and two sherries.

478
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,778
Bubble, bubble,

479
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:39,364
toil and trouble.

480
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,199
Ooh!

481
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:43,534
Everyone nice
and lubricated out there?

482
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,900
How you doing
in the cheap seats?

483
00:20:46,955 --> 00:20:48,456
- All right!
- All right.

484
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,750
Now I just want you
to think about something.

485
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,418
Especially you with your hand

486
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:54,671
precariously close
to your crotch there.

487
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,966
Every girl
you see working tonight,

488
00:20:58,049 --> 00:21:00,635
shaking their moneymakers...

489
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:03,388
has a father.

490
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:05,264
That's right, me, too.
I have a father.

491
00:21:05,348 --> 00:21:06,683
Goes by Abraham.

492
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,268
He thought I'd grow up
to be the perfect lady.

493
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:11,604
And here I am,
slinging dick jokes

494
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:13,272
in a strip club
to a bunch of drunk men

495
00:21:13,356 --> 00:21:14,816
with various degrees
of syphilis.

496
00:21:14,899 --> 00:21:16,442
So happy Father's Day!

497
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,335
You're home late.

498
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:36,671
- You're up late.
- Where have you been?

499
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,594
We went out to get
something to eat after work.

500
00:21:38,631 --> 00:21:40,216
- We?
- Me and Susie.

501
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:41,968
Oh, so no boyfriend.

502
00:21:42,051 --> 00:21:43,344
Well, if you squint.

503
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:45,430
Late-night dining sounds
very glamorous.

504
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:48,016
I ate my grilled cheese
with my pinkie up.

505
00:21:48,099 --> 00:21:49,392
Where are you going?

506
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:50,995
You're certainly not gonna
eat again, are you?

507
00:21:51,019 --> 00:21:52,186
You'll lose your figure.

508
00:21:52,270 --> 00:21:53,590
Then you'll never get
a boyfriend.

509
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:57,233
I already have a shadow, Mama.

510
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,194
There's something
I need to discuss with you.

511
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:01,946
Something
that can't wait till morning?

512
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,322
I'm exhausted.

513
00:22:03,406 --> 00:22:05,491
It's 5:00 a.m. It is morning.

514
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:06,993
This is me

515
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,745
falling asleep on the counter.

516
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,329
I have a new matchmaking client.

517
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:13,458
Solomon Melamid,
of the Melamids.

518
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,793
- Are you listening?
- Uh-huh, Mallomars.

519
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:17,420
Melamids.

520
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:20,131
Miriam, wake up.
This is important.

521
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:22,508
He has two unmarried daughters
and he's richer than God.

522
00:22:22,592 --> 00:22:24,469
Sounds great.
Mallomars sound better, but...

523
00:22:24,552 --> 00:22:26,554
He's a very important man.

524
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:28,517
- He's very concerned about discretion.
- Uh-huh.

525
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:31,142
And I have promised him that
I am nothing if not discreet.

526
00:22:31,225 --> 00:22:33,603
- I will do nothing to embarrass him.
- Uh-huh.

527
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:35,063
I won't.

528
00:22:35,146 --> 00:22:36,647
However...

529
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:40,443
What?

530
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:48,951
I'm thinking things are
gonna get a little loud.

531
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:50,953
I don't want to wake the kids.

532
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:56,209
You were saying?

533
00:22:56,292 --> 00:22:57,919
Your career thing.

534
00:22:58,002 --> 00:22:59,670
- Yep.
- It's a problem.

535
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:01,255
Mallomars don't like jokes?

536
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:03,800
Well, they don't like
strip clubs.

537
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:06,094
You've been hiding it from us,
so you must understand

538
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:07,780
- where they're coming from.
- Where'd you get that?

539
00:23:07,804 --> 00:23:09,055
Your room. It's full of them.

540
00:23:09,138 --> 00:23:10,515
You're snooping in my room,

541
00:23:10,598 --> 00:23:12,058
like I'm 15?

542
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:14,221
No, you didn't lie and sneak
around when you were 15.

543
00:23:14,268 --> 00:23:15,853
I never lied about the club.

544
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:17,438
I just didn't tell you
the details.

545
00:23:17,522 --> 00:23:19,082
I didn't want to make you
uncomfortable.

546
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:20,942
A rubber girdle
is uncomfortable.

547
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:22,985
Stumbling onto a box
of newspaper clippings

548
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:24,570
linking your daughter
to a strip club

549
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:26,322
for all the world to see
is excruciating!

550
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:29,492
It's pretty hard to stumble onto
a locked box in a closed drawer.

551
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,077
So you were hiding it.

552
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,745
No. I wasn't hiding my box

553
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:35,123
of my clippings in my apartment.

554
00:23:35,206 --> 00:23:36,266
You mean the apartment
your father

555
00:23:36,290 --> 00:23:37,208
and I bought back for you.

556
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:38,292
That's your cover story

557
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:39,293
for something you're hiding.

558
00:23:39,377 --> 00:23:40,479
Well, it's not a cover story

559
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:41,838
if you don't use it
consistently.

560
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:43,631
Yes, I am working
at a strip club.

561
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:46,008
- So you're a stripper?
- No, I am a comic.

562
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:48,386
Solomon Melamid will think
you are a stripper.

563
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:50,349
Well, then he'll be
very disappointed by my act.

564
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:51,681
Miriam, hear me.

565
00:23:51,764 --> 00:23:53,808
There are dozens
of rich, homely girls

566
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:55,434
in the Melamid clan.

567
00:23:55,518 --> 00:23:58,146
And all four of Solomon
Melamid's sisters are widows.

568
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:00,189
Suspicious? Fine. I don't care.

569
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:01,983
This large, sad family is
a cash cow,

570
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:03,317
and I want to milk it.

571
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:05,403
Who's stopping you? Grab a pail.

572
00:24:05,486 --> 00:24:07,005
I can't because my daughter's
a stripper.

573
00:24:07,029 --> 00:24:09,574
Are we really
gonna do this again?

574
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:11,718
What else do I call a woman
who performs at a strip club?

575
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:13,494
An emcee, a comic,

576
00:24:13,578 --> 00:24:15,371
a jokester, a card,

577
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:16,998
a gagster, a wag, a wit...

578
00:24:17,081 --> 00:24:19,143
Would you go to a dentist whose
office was in a whorehouse?

579
00:24:19,167 --> 00:24:21,002
Okay, the sun is coming up

580
00:24:21,085 --> 00:24:22,855
and I have to talk to Ethan's
teacher at 8:00 about the odds

581
00:24:22,879 --> 00:24:24,398
of him getting out of
kindergarten on the first try,

582
00:24:24,422 --> 00:24:25,923
so let's wrap this up.

583
00:24:26,007 --> 00:24:27,447
What do you want me
to do here, Mama?

584
00:24:27,508 --> 00:24:30,595
- Quit.
- No. I am a comedian.

585
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:32,013
Well, comedian somewhere else.

586
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:34,098
The Wolford pays me.

587
00:24:34,182 --> 00:24:37,018
It's regular money and
I can do my act the way I want.

588
00:24:37,101 --> 00:24:38,501
Why not just go back
to the Gashole?

589
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:40,563
The Gaslight.
That's a basket house.

590
00:24:40,646 --> 00:24:42,273
There's no money there.

591
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:44,501
I don't see how Mallomar's
even gonna find out about this.

592
00:24:44,525 --> 00:24:45,669
He'll read about you
in the paper.

593
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:47,778
I doubt he reads L. Roy Dunham.

594
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:49,238
Mr. Melamid reads everything.

595
00:24:49,322 --> 00:24:51,532
Well, even if he does,
we have different names.

596
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:54,577
- Weissman, Maisel.
- L. Roy Dunham is a journalist.

597
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,638
He will track down your identity
and he will eventually print it.

598
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,664
Well, que será, será.

599
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:01,250
Miriam, my job is
very important to me.

600
00:25:01,334 --> 00:25:03,628
I could be on the verge
of something very big here.

601
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:07,131
Me, too.

602
00:25:44,919 --> 00:25:46,379
Shit.

603
00:25:46,462 --> 00:25:48,756
Yeah. It's fucking fabulous.

604
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,270
Here.

605
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:05,439
You kind of fucked up
the floral arrangement there.

606
00:26:08,693 --> 00:26:11,821
There,
now it's truly fucked up.

607
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:13,447
We're off to a productive start.

608
00:26:13,531 --> 00:26:15,533
- Bar?
- Bar.

609
00:26:22,498 --> 00:26:23,958
What can I get
for you?

610
00:26:24,041 --> 00:26:25,793
What's
your most expensive Scotch?

611
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:27,556
I think that would be
the Balvenie 30, sir.

612
00:26:27,586 --> 00:26:29,714
That one. Uh, make it a double.

613
00:26:29,797 --> 00:26:32,133
A triple.
Hey, what's your top shelf gin?

614
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:34,111
- Throw some of that in there, too.
- I'll have the same.

615
00:26:34,135 --> 00:26:36,178
- But with a cherry.
- Your most expensive cherry.

616
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,306
Two cherries, please.

617
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:47,106
Let's do some business.

618
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:50,109
Hello, boys.

619
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,236
Mrs. Maisel, Miriam,
hot rising comic.

620
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,071
Get in there, honey.

621
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:55,924
- Oh, she is something, huh?
- Smile.

622
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,134
Looks good
in a bathing suit, too.

623
00:26:57,158 --> 00:26:59,618
Boy! Legs and tits for days!

624
00:26:59,702 --> 00:27:01,096
- Okay, got it.
- Good?

625
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,414
You got it? Okay.

626
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:05,916
Uh, Susie Myerson and Associates
is her representation.

627
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,960
Well, that was sufficiently
gross and demeaning.

628
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:10,129
- You're welcome.
- Interesting combination.

629
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,298
What are they called?

630
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:14,258
Sweet Revenge.

631
00:27:18,054 --> 00:27:19,555
Whoa!

632
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:21,724
This is definitely gonna
make me throw up.

633
00:27:21,807 --> 00:27:23,559
Do it on the dance floor.

634
00:27:23,642 --> 00:27:25,811
- Canapé?
- I can indeed.

635
00:27:25,895 --> 00:27:27,688
Great portions here.

636
00:27:27,772 --> 00:27:29,273
Eh, 20 bucks right there.

637
00:27:29,357 --> 00:27:30,941
- Heads up.
- Ooh!

638
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:32,068
- Oh, my God.
- Hmm?

639
00:27:32,151 --> 00:27:33,986
Susie, it's Sidney Poitier.

640
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,238
- What? Where?
- There, front table.

641
00:27:36,322 --> 00:27:38,783
Wow, and he's talking
to, uh, Harvey.

642
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:40,868
- From the movie.
- Harvey was the rabbit.

643
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,620
But that is Jimmy Stewart.

644
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:44,580
Oh, my God, Jimmy Stewart is
sexy in person.

645
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,540
Ew. Oh.

646
00:27:47,917 --> 00:27:49,418
Oh, my God.

647
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:51,045
- These are delicious.
- What are they?

648
00:27:51,128 --> 00:27:52,797
I don't even know.

649
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,441
A little ball of something
that teaches you

650
00:27:54,465 --> 00:27:56,109
what pleasure is
even if you've been half-dead

651
00:27:56,133 --> 00:27:57,760
- your whole fucking life.
- Excuse me.

652
00:27:57,843 --> 00:27:59,428
Oh, no balls, just puffs.

653
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:02,348
Mmm, puffs are good.

654
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:04,392
Mm-hmm, I repeat,
puffs are very good.

655
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:05,976
Oh, yeah.

656
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:08,521
I bet if you put a puff with
a ball and maybe some cheese...

657
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:10,540
Wait, hang on, we're not
supposed to be enjoying this.

658
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:12,691
- Are we?
- No, we're not enjoying this.

659
00:28:12,775 --> 00:28:15,319
Are you crazy? We're just
eating and drinking...

660
00:28:15,403 --> 00:28:17,488
Ah, fuck, we are enjoying it.

661
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:19,365
All right, let's get back on...

662
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:22,201
Will you get out of here?

663
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,412
The lights are different, right?

664
00:28:24,495 --> 00:28:26,372
- Yeah, something's happening.
- Good.

665
00:28:26,455 --> 00:28:28,332
I thought it was the drink.

666
00:28:28,416 --> 00:28:30,376
This shit has to be
what killed Toulouse-Lautrec.

667
00:28:30,459 --> 00:28:33,170
Where's Carole?
And the rest of the guys?

668
00:28:33,254 --> 00:28:34,564
I don't recognize a soul
up there.

669
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,424
Hmm, must've gotten a new band.

670
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:38,592

- No, he doesn't.

00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:05,953
His hair looks thin.

676
00:29:06,036 --> 00:29:07,413

693
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:12,704
Did she just fucking curtsy?
Is that what she did?

694
00:30:12,728 --> 00:30:14,522
Are you watching this shit?

695
00:30:14,605 --> 00:30:16,524
This drink is
really growing on me.

696
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:18,817
Now look at this.

697
00:30:18,901 --> 00:30:21,403
None of y'all had anywhere
else to go tonight?

698
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:23,030
Well, good.

699
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:25,032
'Cause now I get to gloat.

700
00:30:25,115 --> 00:30:26,242
Look at the girl over there.

701
00:30:26,325 --> 00:30:27,868
All right, now stop looking,

702
00:30:27,952 --> 00:30:30,663
'cause she's mine.

703
00:30:30,746 --> 00:30:32,915
Mrs. Shy Baldwin.

704
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:35,543
I'm the luckiest man
in the world, baby.

705
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:37,795
- Aw!
- And so,

706
00:30:37,878 --> 00:30:40,381
in honor of my wife...
Boy, that is tough to say.

707
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:42,591
Um, I'll practice,
I'll practice.

708
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:44,552
You just heard a little
of my new single.

709
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:49,866
And it's a special one
because the lyrics were written

710
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:51,809
by my boy Reggie Harris.

711
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:53,954
Which is fitting because
that man's been putting words

712
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:55,271
in my mouth since we were kids

713
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,314
begging his grandmom
to buy us ice cream.

714
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:01,610
He made me say
I had heat stroke...

715
00:31:01,694 --> 00:31:03,988
Cute story about a control freak

716
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:06,574
making his pal cheat
an old lady.

717
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:08,117
...the people I'm closest to.

718
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:09,493
I feel your love.

719
00:31:09,577 --> 00:31:12,121
And my heart is
with you tonight.

720
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:18,335
Feel better?

721
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:20,004
- Yep.
- And now there's someone

722
00:31:20,087 --> 00:31:22,590
else who wants to chime in here.

723
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:25,384
You know him, you love him.

724
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,344
It's my good friend,

725
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:29,638
Mr. Harry Belafonte.

726
00:31:31,682 --> 00:31:33,058
Yeah!

727
00:31:33,142 --> 00:31:34,518
Someone good!

728
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:41,442
Shy, Monica,

729
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:43,360
I had a special song
written for you.

730
00:31:43,444 --> 00:31:45,088
And I'm gonna sing it now,
if nobody minds.

731
00:31:45,112 --> 00:31:46,196
Three, four.

Mei! I'm here!

754
00:32:32,618 --> 00:32:34,370
Joel? Thank God.

755
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:36,455
Okay.

756
00:32:38,332 --> 00:32:40,250
I got a dress.

757
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:42,002
I know. I got eyes.

758
00:32:42,086 --> 00:32:43,754
It's got a skirt and bow, see?

759
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:46,256
There's birds on the top, kind
of a Peter Pan collar thing.

760
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,633
You look great.

761
00:32:47,716 --> 00:32:49,218
You sure? I don't know.

762
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,404
The skirt is weird, and I don't
know what the bird is,

763
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:53,180
and why is this
a Peter Pan collar?

764
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:54,532
I've seen <i>Peter Pan,</i>
I've read <i>Peter Pan.</i>

765
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:55,891
I don't get the connection.

766
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,643
Anyhow, I told
the girl at the shop

767
00:32:57,726 --> 00:32:59,311
that I needed a dress
to meet my...

768
00:32:59,395 --> 00:33:02,147
whatever you are's parents,
and she handed me this.

769
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:03,691
Great.

770
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:05,651
Are you sure?

771
00:33:05,734 --> 00:33:07,671
'Cause it's really important
that this dress is right.

772
00:33:07,695 --> 00:33:09,547
And while normally I don't
care what anybody thinks

773
00:33:09,571 --> 00:33:11,990
about anything, I feel like
there's a lot at stake here.

774
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:13,784
- There's not.
- Of course there is.

775
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,494
Are you crazy?
The first thing they see

776
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:17,497
is the dress and the second
thing they see is me,

777
00:33:17,538 --> 00:33:19,164
so initially I asked
the lady at the shop

778
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:20,928
if she had a dress
with a matzo ball print,

779
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:23,019
which elicited exactly the
kind of response you'd think...

780
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:25,587
deafening silence...
so I just took this one.

781
00:33:25,671 --> 00:33:28,048
You look perfect.

782
00:33:28,132 --> 00:33:30,300
My hair will be better.

783
00:33:30,384 --> 00:33:32,636
So, if we get a cab
within 20 minutes,

784
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,513
we can be
at my folks' place in time.

785
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,306
Or we can be a little late.

786
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:37,990
Shorten the length
of time we're exposed.

787
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:40,227
No! Oh, my God,
we can't be late!

788
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:42,938
I want to do
everything perfectly.

789
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,233
Shit. Too colorful.

790
00:33:46,316 --> 00:33:47,985
Is this too colorful?
It's too colorful.

791
00:33:48,068 --> 00:33:50,004
I couldn't see at the shop
that this was too colorful?

792
00:33:50,028 --> 00:33:51,905
- Mei, should I make us a drink?
- Yes.

793
00:33:51,989 --> 00:33:54,008
So I can be drunk and late
with a too colorful dress

794
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,743
and a Peter Pan collar.
Thanks, Joel!

795
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:57,953
- Hey, you need to relax.
- Can't.

796
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,788
- You have to breathe.
- Nope.

797
00:33:59,872 --> 00:34:01,874
I like what you're wearing.

798
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:03,792
But that's probably
'cause you're in it.

799
00:34:03,876 --> 00:34:06,503
Unbelievable.
You want to have sex now?

800
00:34:06,587 --> 00:34:07,838
- No.
- That was your sex call.

801
00:34:07,921 --> 00:34:09,423
- My what?
- Your sex call.

802
00:34:09,506 --> 00:34:11,401
- I do not want to have sex.
- Is that because of the dress?

803
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:12,885
Please take me up on that drink.

804
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:15,095
I got together with Adina
Kritzer, from pathology lab?

805
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:17,055
She taught me some things
about Jewish culture.

806
00:34:17,139 --> 00:34:18,807
But it's all dumped
out of my head.

807
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:20,642
I had Yiddish.
Now I have nothing.

808
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:22,579
You have Jewish culture
right here at your disposal.

809
00:34:22,603 --> 00:34:24,897
I remember two words...
"tsoris" and "gefilte fish."

810
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:26,875
- That's all you need to know.
- I bought a yarmulke.

811
00:34:26,899 --> 00:34:28,692
Mei, honey,
girls don't wear yarmulkes.

812
00:34:28,776 --> 00:34:30,486
What? Fuck.

813
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:32,297
That would've been good
for Adina to mention.

814
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:34,490
Bitch. And I'm pretty sure
all sales are final.

815
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:36,325
- I'll wear the yarmulke.
- It's pink.

816
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:37,576
We'll use it as a coaster.

817
00:34:37,659 --> 00:34:39,119
I'm gonna try on
the other dress.

818
00:34:39,203 --> 00:34:41,079
And throw up.
That's the sound you'll hear.

819
00:34:41,163 --> 00:34:43,040
Ignore it.

820
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:51,232
Moishe, it's Joely and his little girlfriend!

821
00:34:51,256 --> 00:34:52,549
She's here, Shirl!

822
00:34:52,633 --> 00:34:54,360
- Don't open the door!
- I'm gonna open the door.

823
00:34:54,384 --> 00:34:56,678
- Don't open the door!
- I got to open the door, Shirl!

824
00:34:56,762 --> 00:34:59,056
I want to see her at the exact
same time you see her.

825
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:02,017
Where is she?

826
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:03,352
She parking the car?

827
00:35:03,435 --> 00:35:05,145
That's quite a greeting. Hi, Ma.

828
00:35:05,229 --> 00:35:06,772
Well, where is she?
What happened?

829
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:08,816
Did you break up?

830
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:10,651
- Let him talk, Shirl.
- She's feeling sick.

831
00:35:10,734 --> 00:35:12,653
- What's the matter with her?
- She's sick.

832
00:35:12,736 --> 00:35:14,172
It's nothing serious,
but there was a lot of sneezing.

833
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:15,989
I'm devastated.

834
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:17,717
I would've called ahead,
but she started feeling worse

835
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:20,077
in the cab, so I dropped
her back at her apartment.

836
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,138
Did she think she couldn't
be sick here? I'm a mother.

837
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:24,039
She wanted you to have this.

838
00:35:24,122 --> 00:35:25,666
- She picked it out herself.
- Nice.

839
00:35:25,749 --> 00:35:27,292
Your lady has taste.

840
00:35:27,376 --> 00:35:29,270
Well, at least you can tell
us all about her over dinner.

841
00:35:29,294 --> 00:35:30,980
You know, you haven't
even told us her name.

842
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:33,423
- It's Rachel.
- Ah, you have a cousin named Rachel.

843
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:35,384
- Different Rachel.
- Rachel.

844
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,386
Such a nice Jewish name.

845
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,012
The nicest.

846
00:35:39,096 --> 00:35:40,573
Your father has
a cousin named Rachel?

847
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:42,182
Different Rachel.

848
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:45,143
Looks like he's got
the good kind of croutons.

849
00:35:45,227 --> 00:35:47,229
Motherfucker.

850
00:35:53,944 --> 00:35:55,529
Be right back.

851
00:35:55,612 --> 00:35:57,823
I have to powder my nose.

852
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:14,089
You know, the lighting's
better in the ladies' room.

853
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,592
Well, well, well.

854
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:19,052
Bigger mirrors, too.

855
00:36:19,136 --> 00:36:21,138
You look surprised.

856
00:36:21,221 --> 00:36:22,890
A little.

857
00:36:22,973 --> 00:36:24,892
So my invitation was a mistake.

858
00:36:24,975 --> 00:36:26,518
I don't know.

859
00:36:26,602 --> 00:36:28,228
The PR team made the guest list.

860
00:36:28,312 --> 00:36:30,230
Jerry Lewis wasn't
invited either,

861
00:36:30,314 --> 00:36:31,940
if it makes you feel any better.

862
00:36:32,024 --> 00:36:33,692
- Not really.
- He came anyway.

863
00:36:33,775 --> 00:36:35,169
Princess Grace is here.
Did you see her?

864
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,737
- No.
- Oh, you will.

865
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,822
Hang out by the bar.

866
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:43,619
Monica looks beautiful.

867
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:45,787
She's a nice girl.

868
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:48,081
- She enjoys puzzles.
- Oh.

869
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:49,917
- Neat.
- Yeah.

870
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:53,253
Neat. I bought her
a house in Beverly Hills.

871
00:36:53,337 --> 00:36:56,006
- Bought her a house?
- Well, I'm always traveling.

872
00:36:56,089 --> 00:36:58,383
- She likes oranges.
- You should get her

873
00:36:58,467 --> 00:37:00,510
a puzzle of an orange grove.
She'll lose her mind.

874
00:37:00,594 --> 00:37:03,472
First wedding anniversary gift,
covered.

875
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,349
And look at you.

876
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:07,809
A wedding, a dance, a song,

877
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:10,103
- and you hardly break a sweat.
- Ah.

878
00:37:10,187 --> 00:37:12,356
The trick's keeping the fabric
on your clothes light.

879
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:14,316
Nat King Cole taught me that.

880
00:37:14,399 --> 00:37:16,276
He didn't come.

881
00:37:16,360 --> 00:37:18,570
I was looking around
for the gang.

882
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:21,365
Lester, Tommy, Carole, Slim.

883
00:37:21,448 --> 00:37:24,326
- Got 'em locked up somewhere?
- Uh, no.

884
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:26,828
- I have a new band.
- Why?

885
00:37:26,912 --> 00:37:28,497
I wanted a new sound.

886
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:30,058
Because the old one
was such a disappointment.

887
00:37:30,082 --> 00:37:32,000
You got to keep things fresh.

888
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:33,311
And they're
a really great group.

889
00:37:33,335 --> 00:37:34,896
You heard them out there.
They can really swing.

890
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:37,673
Yeah. They sounded great.

891
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,341
But you don't miss the gang?

892
00:37:39,424 --> 00:37:41,969
You all just seemed like family.

893
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:43,512
You know what I miss?

894
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:45,555
I miss your brisket.

895
00:37:45,639 --> 00:37:48,600
I have not had
a decent meal since the...

896
00:37:52,604 --> 00:37:55,565
Jack Ballard's
not much of a cook, huh?

897
00:37:55,649 --> 00:37:57,484
Jack Ballard's
not much of a comic, either.

898
00:37:57,567 --> 00:37:59,861
No. He's not.

899
00:37:59,945 --> 00:38:01,446
You had a good comic
for a while.

900
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:02,906
Beginning of the tour.

901
00:38:02,990 --> 00:38:05,158
Who was that?
Trying to remember. Oh, yes.

902
00:38:05,242 --> 00:38:07,369
Me. What happened there?

903
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,954
Trying to remember.

904
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:12,582
I believe I can see a tarmac?

905
00:38:12,666 --> 00:38:15,043
And in the back there, a plane?

906
00:38:15,127 --> 00:38:16,646
- Was there a plane?
- There was a plane.

907
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:19,631
That's right. That big thing
sitting there full of people.

908
00:38:19,715 --> 00:38:22,134
And it was missing
a couple of folks, right?

909
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:25,053
- Was it?
- Yep. It was.

910
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:27,222
You should've let me
on that plane, Shy.

911
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,724
Oh, really? And why's that?

912
00:38:28,807 --> 00:38:30,118
Because I had
something to say to you.

913
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:31,577
Oh, I bet you had
a lot to say to me.

914
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:33,729
When you fire someone,
they get mighty chatty.

915
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:35,063
Are you curious?

916
00:38:35,147 --> 00:38:36,541
What I would've said
if I'd gotten on the plane?

917
00:38:36,565 --> 00:38:37,750
Something about winged monkeys?

918
00:38:37,774 --> 00:38:39,735
I would've said
that I fucked up.

919
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,570
I fucked up

920
00:38:41,653 --> 00:38:43,363
like I've never
fucked up anything

921
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:45,490
in a life
not without its fuckups.

922
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:48,160
I would've said
I was scared off my ass

923
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:49,411
getting on that stage,

924
00:38:49,494 --> 00:38:51,496
and Moms Mabley
went on before me.

925
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:52,998
Yeah, it's hard to follow Moms.

926
00:38:53,081 --> 00:38:54,332
I was desperate for that laugh.

927
00:38:54,416 --> 00:38:57,210
I was desperate
to just go out there and kill.

928
00:38:57,294 --> 00:38:59,087
I just thought...

929
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:01,715
hometown crowd, talk about Shy.

930
00:39:01,798 --> 00:39:02,966
So I did.

931
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:06,094
And I did kill,
which was my job,

932
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:08,722
but I should have gone
in a different direction.

933
00:39:08,805 --> 00:39:10,724
"Shy gives a lot of money

934
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:12,827
to abused children. In
other words, he pays his staff."

935
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,746
"Before every concert, Shy
spends half an hour going..."

936
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:15,896
<i>♪ Mi-mi-mi-mi-mi ♪</i> ♪

937
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:17,981
"And then he starts
his vocal exercises."

938
00:39:18,065 --> 00:39:20,400
"Shy doesn't think
he's God's gift to the world,

939
00:39:20,484 --> 00:39:22,795
- but he does call his suits his wrapping paper."
- I get it.

940
00:39:22,819 --> 00:39:25,655
You are a treasure trove
of punch lines.

941
00:39:25,739 --> 00:39:28,200
But I never would have hurt you.

942
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:31,912
Not on purpose.
Not for anything in the world.

943
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,872
I thought we were friends.

944
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:36,833
And I take my friendships
very seriously.

945
00:39:36,917 --> 00:39:40,462
I know how loaded
what I said was,

946
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,255
and if I could take it back,
I would.

947
00:39:42,339 --> 00:39:44,508
If you had just let me
on that plane,

948
00:39:44,591 --> 00:39:46,551
I would have said I was sorry.

949
00:39:46,635 --> 00:39:49,179
And not to keep my job.
I'll get another job.

950
00:39:49,262 --> 00:39:54,017
But because I was
and still am truly sorry.

951
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:57,854
If I'd have let you
on that plane,

952
00:39:57,938 --> 00:39:59,314
you would've brought Susie,

953
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,775
and she would've tried
to stab me with a cheese knife.

954
00:40:01,858 --> 00:40:03,777
And I would have thrown myself
in front of you

955
00:40:03,860 --> 00:40:05,362
and taken the blow.

956
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:06,863
And some Brie.

957
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:09,866
Well...

958
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:13,870
I sure have missed that brisket.

959
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:18,458
I'll send Monica the recipe.

960
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:25,423
You know, I'm back in the States

961
00:40:25,507 --> 00:40:27,175
for a while again next month.

962
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:28,802
Cut another Christmas album.

963
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:31,721
Hmm. I know what to get
my mother for Hanukkah.

964
00:40:31,805 --> 00:40:34,349
Maybe we could,
uh, get together,

965
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:37,144
have a drink.
I-I could take you to...

966
00:40:37,227 --> 00:40:38,687
- No.
- No?

967
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,647
I'm not falling for that again.

968
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:42,607
We're not friends.

969
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:44,693
I have learned my lesson.

970
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:50,907
Congratulations.

971
00:40:50,991 --> 00:40:54,744
I hope you're gonna be
very happy...

972
00:40:54,828 --> 00:40:56,830
Dwayne.

973
00:41:05,255 --> 00:41:06,756
That's what I'm saying.

974
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:09,134
- Can we get out of here?
- Yeah, sure.

975
00:41:09,217 --> 00:41:11,136
Bye. Thanks for the croutons.

976
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:13,638
- I ate everybody's croutons.
- Who let them in?

977
00:41:13,722 --> 00:41:16,224
Ladies,
would you come with us, please?

978
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:17,559
We have invites.

979
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,644
They checked them
at the door and everything.

980
00:41:27,694 --> 00:41:28,945
He still there?

981
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:30,131
- Yep.
- He still big?

982
00:41:30,155 --> 00:41:31,072
- Yep.
- Mm.

983
00:41:40,207 --> 00:41:42,542
- Lou.
- Susie Myerson.

984
00:41:42,626 --> 00:41:45,462
And Mrs. Maisel.
It's nice to see you.

985
00:41:45,545 --> 00:41:47,732
- What is this, Lou?
- I want you to meet my associate,

986
00:41:47,756 --> 00:41:49,090
Ken Bruni.

987
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:51,509
Ken is Shy's new agent
over at MCA.

988
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:53,970
Very nice to meet you, ladies.
Enjoying the party?

989
00:41:54,054 --> 00:41:56,556
- Up until our abduction, it was great.
- Well,

990
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:57,766
we just wanted to say hello

991
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:00,477
and fill you in
on some exciting news.

992
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:03,230
Shy's going to be the lead
in Billy Wilder's next film.

993
00:42:03,313 --> 00:42:04,648
Did you know he could act?

994
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:06,375
I thought today's performance
was pretty good.

995
00:42:06,399 --> 00:42:07,859
I'll cut to the chase.

996
00:42:07,943 --> 00:42:09,486
Everyone here

997
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:12,155
is aware of Shy's proclivities.

998
00:42:12,239 --> 00:42:15,784
But from now on,
we're gonna help him

999
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,136
to stay
on the straight and narrow.

1000
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:19,329
Watch over him 24 hours a day.

1001
00:42:19,412 --> 00:42:21,706
- Isn't that what Reggie does?
- Reggie's gone.

1002
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:22,916
Gone?

1003
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:24,501
- Holy shit.
- Look,

1004
00:42:24,584 --> 00:42:26,962
he's a good guy, Reggie.
I like him.

1005
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,922
But he's too close with Shy

1006
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:31,132
to control him.
There's too much history.

1007
00:42:31,216 --> 00:42:33,843
- And too much history with the band, too, huh?
- Exactly.

1008
00:42:33,927 --> 00:42:35,446
Shy fought it,
but eventually he realized

1009
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:37,013
it was time
to chart a new course.

1010
00:42:37,097 --> 00:42:39,557
All this because I cracked
a couple Judy Garland jokes

1011
00:42:39,641 --> 00:42:41,142
- at the Apollo?
- No,

1012
00:42:41,226 --> 00:42:43,061
no, this has been
a long time coming.

1013
00:42:43,144 --> 00:42:45,397
That night at the Apollo
just gave us an opening.

1014
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,690
So, thank you.

1015
00:42:46,773 --> 00:42:48,692
Reggie got Shy
to where he is now.

1016
00:42:48,775 --> 00:42:51,194
- You realize that?
- Reggie's taken care of.

1017
00:42:51,278 --> 00:42:53,488
Big severance.
We threw him some publishing.

1018
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:55,282
He's buying a house
in Westchester.

1019
00:42:55,365 --> 00:42:57,325
- Everybody's happy.
- Oh, I bet.

1020
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:59,053
'Cause when you think Reggie,
you think Westchester.

1021
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:01,079
All right, Lou. Suit guy.

1022
00:43:01,162 --> 00:43:03,164
- Ken.
- Thanks for filling us in

1023
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:04,684
on a bunch of stuff
we didn't give a fuck about.

1024
00:43:04,708 --> 00:43:05,792
Okay for us to go?

1025
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:07,502
Just another minute
of your time.

1026
00:43:07,585 --> 00:43:10,297
We understand you and Shy
got pretty friendly on tour

1027
00:43:10,380 --> 00:43:12,215
and that maybe you saw
some things.

1028
00:43:12,299 --> 00:43:15,010
One thing in particular
that occurred on a boat.

1029
00:43:15,093 --> 00:43:17,637
We know that you thought
you were helping him,

1030
00:43:17,721 --> 00:43:19,532
so the way it ended up with you
on the tarmac that night,

1031
00:43:19,556 --> 00:43:22,309
it doesn't seem right.
We want to make it right.

1032
00:43:22,392 --> 00:43:23,852
Okay.

1033
00:43:23,935 --> 00:43:25,812
How does $2,000 sound?

1034
00:43:25,895 --> 00:43:27,689
Two thousand dollars? Wow.

1035
00:43:27,772 --> 00:43:30,442
- You want to give me $2,000?
- In exchange

1036
00:43:30,525 --> 00:43:32,152
for your signature
on a legal agreement

1037
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:34,696
stating that you won't disparage
or besmirch Shy Baldwin

1038
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:37,032
in any way,
publicly or privately.

1039
00:43:37,115 --> 00:43:39,075
You invited me
so you could bribe me?

1040
00:43:39,159 --> 00:43:40,720
It's not a bribe.
It's an agreement.

1041
00:43:40,744 --> 00:43:42,954
There is no way I would
ever take $2,000 from you.

1042
00:43:43,038 --> 00:43:45,874
Uh, yeah, right.
Fuck you and your $2,000.

1043
00:43:45,957 --> 00:43:48,335
- How about three?
- Miriam?

1044
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:51,212
- Nope. Three? Forget it.
- Five.

1045
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:53,423
Now, this is getting
very interesting.

1046
00:43:53,506 --> 00:43:55,717
- Keep it.
- Yep.

1047
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,636
We thought about it.
Not fucking interested.

1048
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,805
- Ten.
- Okay, Miriam, that's a car.

1049
00:44:00,889 --> 00:44:03,475
Three cars
or one big, fancy German car.

1050
00:44:03,558 --> 00:44:05,685
- A shiny, nazi Mercedes.
- No.

1051
00:44:05,769 --> 00:44:07,729
- No.
- Fuck! No.

1052
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:09,314
Last and best. Twelve.

1053
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:11,274
Oh, are there harps
playing somewhere?

1054
00:44:11,358 --> 00:44:12,984
- I'm hearing harps.
- We're done here.

1055
00:44:13,068 --> 00:44:14,194
- We are?
- Yes.

1056
00:44:14,277 --> 00:44:15,338
- Come on.
- We'd like you

1057
00:44:15,362 --> 00:44:16,602
to reconsider. The offer's gone

1058
00:44:16,654 --> 00:44:17,798
as soon as
you walk out the door.

1059
00:44:17,822 --> 00:44:19,300
I promised Shy
I would never tell anyone

1060
00:44:19,324 --> 00:44:20,509
about that night, and I haven't.

1061
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:22,327
I promised Shy.

1062
00:44:22,410 --> 00:44:24,245
Let's go.

1063
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:26,057
- Unless you want to...
- I want nothing from them.

1064
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:28,917
Yep, me, neither.
Let's go. Fuck you.

1065
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:30,502
Stupid idea to come here.

1066
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:32,837
- Was that aimed at me?
- No. Yes.

1067
00:44:32,921 --> 00:44:35,590
- This was your idea.
- My idea? If it wasn't for you,

1068
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:36,942
I wouldn't have found
my invite to this thing

1069
00:44:36,966 --> 00:44:38,968
for, like, ten months,
so this is your fault.

1070
00:44:39,052 --> 00:44:40,553
Fuck it.
We're getting gift bags.

1071
00:44:40,637 --> 00:44:43,181
That's tacky. I bet there's not
even anything good...

1072
00:44:43,264 --> 00:44:44,891
Oh, my God, it's Chanel No. 5.

1073
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:47,102
- Get one for Grandma Mary.
- Who?

1074
00:44:47,185 --> 00:44:49,354
Our grandmother
who couldn't come tonight

1075
00:44:49,437 --> 00:44:51,689
but was also invited
and loves Chanel No. 5.

1076
00:44:51,773 --> 00:44:54,192
- Got it.
- I'll meet you outside.

1077
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:15,338
- Where the hell were you?
- I was looking for a cab.

1078
00:45:15,422 --> 00:45:17,173
You told me,
"Meet me out front."

1079
00:45:17,257 --> 00:45:18,776
There weren't any cabs
out front, so I thought

1080
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,069
I'd go around the corner
because I remembered

1081
00:45:20,093 --> 00:45:21,320
that whenever I shop
at Bergdorf's,

1082
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:22,905
I always go out the side door
to grab a cab

1083
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:25,157
- before they turn onto Fifth.
- I got this cab on Fifth.

1084
00:45:25,181 --> 00:45:26,808
Well, it's not a foolproof plan.

1085
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:28,309
Just get in the goddamn car.

1086
00:45:28,393 --> 00:45:29,978
Next time, I leave you here.

1087
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:55,253
<i>♪ Baby...</i>

1088
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,589
- The till's over.
- Over?

1089
00:45:57,672 --> 00:45:59,507
That's not possible.
I did the count myself.

1090
00:45:59,591 --> 00:46:01,111
I counted twice.
There's an extra five.

1091
00:46:01,176 --> 00:46:02,886
Give it. I must've screwed up.

1092
00:46:02,969 --> 00:46:04,572
Thanks for catching it.

1093
00:46:04,596 --> 00:46:07,724
- You know this guy?
- Pop. What are you doing here?

1094
00:46:07,807 --> 00:46:09,058
I was in the area

1095
00:46:09,142 --> 00:46:11,019
seeing one of my notions
and trimmings guys

1096
00:46:11,102 --> 00:46:12,187
and thought I'd stop by.

1097
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:13,747
Well, come on in.
I'll spot you a drink.

1098
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,190
Place looks good.

1099
00:46:15,273 --> 00:46:18,902
The decor, the ambience.
Very impressive.

1100
00:46:18,985 --> 00:46:21,154
Last time I was here,
it was covered in buttons.

1101
00:46:21,237 --> 00:46:23,698
- Couple of whiskies for me and my pop.
- You got it, boss.

1102
00:46:23,781 --> 00:46:25,575
"Boss."
I like the sound of that.

1103
00:46:25,658 --> 00:46:28,119
- It does not get old.
- You know that the key

1104
00:46:28,203 --> 00:46:31,080
to a great relationship
with your employees is respect.

1105
00:46:31,164 --> 00:46:32,916
In order for them
to be productive,

1106
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:34,685
they got to think
you trust them unconditionally.

1107
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:36,549
- Absolutely.
- But every one of them's a thief,

1108
00:46:36,586 --> 00:46:38,254
- so don't trust a single one.
- I know.

1109
00:46:38,338 --> 00:46:40,715
I put an extra five in the till,
and he called it out.

1110
00:46:40,798 --> 00:46:43,176
And didn't pocket it.
That means he's a keeper.

1111
00:46:43,259 --> 00:46:45,386
I was taught by the best.

1112
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:46,888
Thanks.

1113
00:46:46,971 --> 00:46:48,640
Any chance
your girlfriend's around?

1114
00:46:48,723 --> 00:46:51,309
No. It's crunch time
at school for her.

1115
00:46:51,392 --> 00:46:53,770
- Always with the books.
- In the summer?

1116
00:46:53,853 --> 00:46:55,939
- It's medical school.
- Medical school.

1117
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:57,148
Well, well, well.

1118
00:46:57,232 --> 00:46:59,234
She sounds interesting,
this girl.

1119
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:01,069
She is. She's great.

1120
00:47:01,152 --> 00:47:03,988
With a lot of different sides
to her. Conflicting sides.

1121
00:47:04,072 --> 00:47:06,241
- What?
- Well, the other night,

1122
00:47:06,324 --> 00:47:07,718
the first half of dinner,
she was Rachel,

1123
00:47:07,742 --> 00:47:09,369
sometime before kugel,
she was Rebecca,

1124
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:11,372
after kugel she was Ruth.
You kept them biblical.

1125
00:47:11,412 --> 00:47:13,164
- That was nice.
- I was nervous.

1126
00:47:13,248 --> 00:47:15,792
- And I corrected myself.
You remember that, right? - I do.

1127
00:47:15,875 --> 00:47:17,394
Just trying to think
when was the last time

1128
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:19,128
I called Shirley
Sheila or Trudy.

1129
00:47:19,212 --> 00:47:21,130
Or had to think
for a couple of seconds

1130
00:47:21,214 --> 00:47:22,715
when somebody asked how we met.

1131
00:47:22,799 --> 00:47:24,842
Ma's questions come
pretty fast and furious, Pop.

1132
00:47:24,926 --> 00:47:26,636
- You know that.
- Mm-hmm.

1133
00:47:26,719 --> 00:47:28,596
Listen, so you know,

1134
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:30,890
what I know
is all I need to know.

1135
00:47:30,974 --> 00:47:33,601
- I don't know.
- You like her.

1136
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:35,728
That's all I know.
That's all I need to know.

1137
00:47:35,812 --> 00:47:39,399
But keep in mind
your mother is very excited

1138
00:47:39,482 --> 00:47:40,817
about Rachel Rebecca Ruth,

1139
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,694
and when she gets excited
about something

1140
00:47:42,777 --> 00:47:44,195
and that something
disappoints her,

1141
00:47:44,279 --> 00:47:46,239
our house
gets very small and loud.

1142
00:47:46,322 --> 00:47:48,074
- I get it.
- The good news is

1143
00:47:48,157 --> 00:47:50,326
your dinner appearance
got you a little reprieve

1144
00:47:50,410 --> 00:47:51,570
from her trying to set you up

1145
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:53,538
with every single Jewish girl
she sees,

1146
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:55,248
including your cousin Rachel.

1147
00:47:55,331 --> 00:47:57,125
You can start answering
your phone again.

1148
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:58,459
Great.

1149
00:47:58,543 --> 00:48:00,753
So, there really is a girl?

1150
00:48:00,837 --> 00:48:02,880
- Yes. There really is.
- Okay.

1151
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:05,133
That's all I need to know.
For now.

1152
00:48:05,216 --> 00:48:07,218
You got to open.
I'll see you around.

1153
00:48:07,302 --> 00:48:09,262
- Thank you.
- How many are you?

1154
00:48:11,347 --> 00:48:12,974
Welcome to The Button Club,
folks!

1155
00:48:13,057 --> 00:48:15,226
- Benny, who's your pal?
- Hey.

1161
00:48:30,617 --> 00:48:33,244
How you feeling?
Feeling good? Feeling strong?

1162
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:37,040
Are you trying to speak?

1163
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:39,459
Tell me you did not
lose your fucking voice.

1164
00:48:39,542 --> 00:48:41,294
I need to hear you
say something.

1165
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:43,212
I want to go home now.

1166
00:48:43,296 --> 00:48:45,048
All right, then,
you're good to go.

1167
00:48:45,131 --> 00:48:49,010
In five, four, three, two...

1168
00:48:49,093 --> 00:48:50,762
Welcome back. Our next guest

1169
00:48:50,845 --> 00:48:52,972
is no stranger to you.
Or to plates.

1170
00:48:53,056 --> 00:48:54,432
It's the comedienne
Sophie Lennon,

1171
00:48:54,515 --> 00:48:56,142
but don't turn that dial...

1172
00:48:56,225 --> 00:48:58,269
- That's nice.
- ...because this is going to be

1173
00:48:58,353 --> 00:48:59,979
a fascinating conversation.

1174
00:49:00,063 --> 00:49:01,863
I'm gonna make sure.
Come on out here, Sophie.

1175
00:49:18,665 --> 00:49:21,459
So... Sophie Lennon.

1176
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:24,462
Just how nutsy whacko are you?

1177
00:49:29,425 --> 00:49:31,761
I believe the official diagnosis

1178
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:34,806
was "crazier
than an outhouse rat."

1179
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:38,601
- Good girl.
- Well,

1180
00:49:38,685 --> 00:49:40,537
my producers told me you'd be
forthcoming this evening.

1181
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:42,563
- So far, so good.
- Great. So I can go now?

1182
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:44,875
- You sit right back down now, lady.
You're not going anywhere. - Oh.

1183
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:46,210
In fact, you and I
are gonna play a game.

1184
00:49:46,234 --> 00:49:48,403
- Ooh, a game.
- Just a little True or False.

1185
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:50,506
I had my staff write down
some of the various rumors

1186
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:52,508
we've heard about you
over the years, and there are

1187
00:49:52,532 --> 00:49:54,158
a lot of them. So,

1188
00:49:54,242 --> 00:49:56,220
I'm gonna read them, and you
are gonna say if they are true

1189
00:49:56,244 --> 00:49:58,204
- or false. - Have at it.
- Here we go.

1190
00:49:58,287 --> 00:49:59,640
Frank Sinatra
wrote a song about you.

1191
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:01,541
False. But it is true
that I'm a tramp.

1192
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:04,377
You once saved the life of a total stranger

1193
00:50:04,460 --> 00:50:06,337
- choking in a restaurant.
- False.

1194
00:50:06,421 --> 00:50:08,047
But I'm the one
who made up that rumor,

1195
00:50:08,131 --> 00:50:09,817
and I'm glad to hear
it's still going around.

1196
00:50:09,841 --> 00:50:12,635
You own a 300-acre ranch in Montana.

1197
00:50:12,719 --> 00:50:14,971
Honestly, who doesn't?

1198
00:50:15,054 --> 00:50:17,598
You punched Olivia de Havilland.

1199
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:19,142
She had it coming.

1200
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:21,561
- You punched Humphrey Bogart.
- Cried harder than Olivia.

1201
00:50:21,644 --> 00:50:23,646
You're an addict.

1202
00:50:23,730 --> 00:50:26,899
With multiple addictions.

1203
00:50:26,983 --> 00:50:29,819
It's a long list.
You want to see it?

1204
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:36,701
- No, Gordon, this is dead wrong.
- It is.

1205
00:50:36,784 --> 00:50:41,330
I can stop numbers three
and nine whenever I want.

1206
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:45,835
Ah. Well,

1207
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:47,730
- it's good to know there's no need to worry, then.
- Mm.

1208
00:50:47,754 --> 00:50:50,006
You believe in intelligent life
on other planets.

1209
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:51,466
False. If there's none here,

1210
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:53,402
why would there be
intelligent life anywhere else?

1211
00:50:53,426 --> 00:50:55,386
<i>Very true. Next card.</i>

1212
00:50:55,470 --> 00:50:58,514
<i>Um, you provide financially
for your 85-year-old mother.</i>

1213
00:50:58,598 --> 00:51:00,075
<i>- Yes, that is true.
- And in exchange,</i>

1214
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:01,309
<i>you have her do the ironing.</i>

1215
00:51:01,392 --> 00:51:02,786
<i>Well,
when you stop working,</i>

1216
00:51:02,810 --> 00:51:04,530
<i>you start dying.</i>

1217
00:51:04,604 --> 00:51:06,773
<i>That part is not true,
to be clear.</i>

1218
00:51:06,856 --> 00:51:08,733
<i>You forbid
your employees</i>

1219
00:51:08,816 --> 00:51:10,210
<i>from wearing certain perfumes...</i>

1220
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:12,612
- I'll get it.
- But you'll miss the show.

1221
00:51:12,695 --> 00:51:15,281
There should be a way
to pause this.

1222
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:17,742
Like, you have a separate box

1223
00:51:17,825 --> 00:51:20,203
recording the picture
and sound simultaneously.

1224
00:51:20,286 --> 00:51:23,039
It should be able
to rewind, too.

1225
00:51:23,122 --> 00:51:24,957
<i>That's funny.</i>

1226
00:51:25,041 --> 00:51:27,084
<i>You once canceled a performance</i>

1227
00:51:27,168 --> 00:51:28,437
<i>because you couldn't find
your Seconal.</i>

1228
00:51:28,461 --> 00:51:29,962
<i>Uh, no, I could find</i>

1229
00:51:30,046 --> 00:51:32,632
<i>my Seconal. I just couldn't find the stage.</i>

1230
00:51:34,217 --> 00:51:36,719
Oh, that's lovely.

1231
00:51:38,846 --> 00:51:42,350
It wasn't my fault.

1232
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:45,561
Oh! Uh, sorry.
My stage manager, Maury,

1233
00:51:45,645 --> 00:51:47,164
is either practicing
for his dance recital,

1234
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:49,374
or he's motioning to me that
it's time for our next guest.

1235
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:51,359
But this being
<i>The Gordon Ford Show</i>

1236
00:51:51,442 --> 00:51:53,569
and my being Gordon Ford,
I am making the decision

1237
00:51:53,653 --> 00:51:55,822
to bump our next guest
because I want to keep talking

1238
00:51:55,905 --> 00:51:57,341
to Sophie.
Is that okay with you, folks?

1239
00:51:59,534 --> 00:52:01,595
- You got some more time for me, Sophie?
- Oh, I can even stay

1240
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:03,287
and clean up afterwards
if you want me to.

1241
00:52:05,331 --> 00:52:08,376
So... what happened
that night, Sophie?

1242
00:52:08,459 --> 00:52:10,753
The night
of your big Broadway debut?

1243
00:52:12,505 --> 00:52:13,673
Hmm.

1244
00:52:13,756 --> 00:52:15,883
- I got scared.
- Well,

1245
00:52:15,967 --> 00:52:17,069
I think
we can all understand that.

1246
00:52:17,093 --> 00:52:18,469
You were afraid that you'd fail?

1247
00:52:19,554 --> 00:52:21,305
I think I was afraid
I'd be good.

1248
00:52:21,389 --> 00:52:23,766
It's not a joke.

1249
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:25,601
I was ready for that chance.

1250
00:52:25,685 --> 00:52:28,604
I rehearsed and rehearsed,
and...

1251
00:52:28,688 --> 00:52:33,109
You ever feel so close
to something you really want,

1252
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:37,280
so close that
you just can't stand it,

1253
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:40,616
so you destroy it?
You-you blow it all up?

1254
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:42,618
No.

1255
00:52:42,702 --> 00:52:45,913
Well, I glad you haven't,
and I hope you never will.

1256
00:52:45,997 --> 00:52:48,958
Hmm. Put that
on your plate, gang.

1257
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:50,227
Let's take a short break.

1258
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:51,520
You're watching
<i>The Gordon Ford Show.</i>

1259
00:52:57,341 --> 00:52:59,677
I told you so.

1260
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,096
Right?

1261
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:04,181
- All right. One last question.
- Indeed.

1262
00:53:04,265 --> 00:53:06,726
- Yes. Mm-hmm.
- On behalf of millions,

1263
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:09,186
are we ever gonna see
Sophie from Queens again?

1264
00:53:09,270 --> 00:53:10,938
Sophie from Queens?

1265
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:16,277
Hey. Heck,

1266
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,029
Sophie's having a comeback!

1267
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:21,198
She's running after her career,
yelling, "Come back!"

1268
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:25,745
But, you know,

1269
00:53:25,828 --> 00:53:29,665
I would like my fans
to get to know me, Gordon.

1270
00:53:29,749 --> 00:53:31,834
I'd like for them
to spend some time

1271
00:53:31,918 --> 00:53:33,586
with the real Sophie Lennon.

1272
00:53:33,669 --> 00:53:35,338
She's fun, too.

1273
00:53:35,421 --> 00:53:37,461
Well, you've been a lot of fun
here tonight, Sophie.

1274
00:53:37,506 --> 00:53:40,176
A real gamer.
You are a true legend

1275
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:41,928
in this business.
And who here is perfect?

1276
00:53:42,011 --> 00:53:44,388
Certainly not me. Took
a lot of guts to come out here

1277
00:53:44,472 --> 00:53:45,949
and talk with me today,
and I want to thank you.

1278
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:47,576
I look forward to seeing
what you're doing next,

1279
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:48,976
'cause I will be watching.

1280
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,579
Sophie Lennon, everyone.

1281
00:53:50,603 --> 00:53:53,564
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1282
00:53:57,318 --> 00:53:59,487
We love you, Sophie!

1283
00:54:02,156 --> 00:54:03,491
Who are you?

1284
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:05,576
I'm here for the interview.
I had a 4:00.

1285
00:54:05,660 --> 00:54:06,661
- Today?
- Yeah.

1286
00:54:06,744 --> 00:54:07,745
Fuck.

1287
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:08,996
You do need a secretary.

1288
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:10,456
You've been here since 4:00?

1289
00:54:10,539 --> 00:54:12,333
3:30. I didn't want to be late.

1290
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:13,668
Wow.

1291
00:54:13,751 --> 00:54:16,170
You've been waiting
for seven hours?

1292
00:54:17,338 --> 00:54:19,715
- Okay, you're hired.
- I am?

1293
00:54:19,799 --> 00:54:21,079
Congratulations.
You want a beer?

1294
00:54:21,133 --> 00:54:22,760
Do I still get the job
if I say no?

1295
00:54:22,843 --> 00:54:25,012
- Yep. You start tomorrow.
- What time?

1296
00:54:25,096 --> 00:54:27,348
I don't know.
What time do jobs start?

1297
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:29,767
You're probably sleeping late,
so 10:00?

1298
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:31,018
Good call.

1299
00:54:31,102 --> 00:54:32,687
- See you tomorrow.
- Hey,

1300
00:54:32,770 --> 00:54:34,331
your first job is gonna be
to tell all those other broads

1301
00:54:34,355 --> 00:54:36,357
- they didn't get the job.
- Fine by me.

1302
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,235
- Make it 10:30.
- See you at noon.

1303
00:54:39,318 --> 00:54:41,612
Hey, wait, what's your name?

1304
00:54:47,118 --> 00:54:49,370
You taking Eighth?
There's construction on Eighth.

1305
00:54:49,453 --> 00:54:50,538
I'm not taking Eighth.

1306
00:54:50,621 --> 00:54:51,831
Huh. Felt you turn right.

1307
00:54:51,914 --> 00:54:53,058
That would put you on Eighth.

1308
00:54:53,082 --> 00:54:54,667
Oh, look at that.
You're on Eighth.

1309
00:54:54,750 --> 00:54:57,169
- Get off of Eighth?
- Yes, ma'am.

1310
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:01,924
- Wait. Wait, stop.
- What?

1311
00:55:02,008 --> 00:55:04,677
