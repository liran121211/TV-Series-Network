Well, they're pretty,

Great. I've got a few errands

16
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,498

I'm back in the neighborhood,

00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,189
and there's mountains
of cleaning heading your way.

28
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:05,441
I'll turn 'em around for you
nice and quick.

29

And my tab's still good?
Uh, of course.

30
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:10,446
What was it, 15 bucks?
Something like that.

31
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:13,491
But I thought you'd give me
a higher limit on that tab.

32
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:15,951
A higher limit?
Like, say, 30 bucks?

33
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:18,037
See, I haven't washed a thing
since I left you.

34
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,997
There's so much business
coming your way,

35
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,266
a higher tab would be convenient

00:01:22,708 --> 00:01:23,852
I think I can make that work.

I like to think.
You back in the neighborhood?

47
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:43,979
As of today. And ready
to restart that tab of mine.

48
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:45,648
Sure. What was it, uh, ten?

49
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:48,400
Back in the day. But
I'm thinking double that now.

50
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:50,545
Double?
Or triple. You should see how my kids eat.

51
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:52,029
Well, you should know,
what with six.

52
00:01:52,112 --> 00:01:54,615
So a higher tab's a real
convenience. For you and for me.

53
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:56,700
I guess.
You know Herman the dry cleaner?

54
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:59,537
Practically begged me to raise
my tab. He was a little pushy.

55
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:01,914
I'll see what I can do.
You're a doll.

56

He was begging me
to raise my tab.

82

Kept talking about how
it benefits him more than me.

83
00:02:52,423 --> 00:02:55,301
Ha! Not there. Somewhere else.
But it's kitchen stuff.

84
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:57,487
I'm organizing, Antonio. This is my process.
Walter, I'm a woman. I don't

85
00:02:57,511 --> 00:02:59,030
have a mind for business. Ask the milkman.
Leave me to my process.

Be nicer, Imogene.
We like Antonio.

87

Last week, I dealt with Moishe.

the loan payment on this place.

101
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,089
Brought Esther.

102
00:03:34,173 --> 00:03:35,483
Uh-oh.
<font color="#80FF00">MIDGE:</font> Held her in my lap,

103

holding her one-armed doll.

105
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:41,931
You didn't.
I talked about her needing new shoes.

106
00:03:42,014 --> 00:03:44,075
I couldn't tear up, but then
Esther cried right on cue.

107
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,392
I may have given her a pinch.

108
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:47,353
Shameless.
But it worked.

109
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:49,289
And now if I can just hold off
paying the milk bill,

110
00:03:49,313 --> 00:03:50,332
the laundry bill,
the grocery bill,

111

the butcher bill,
the bakery bill

112
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:52,834

00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,568

It was built for that room.
Yep.

And the TV has to go
across from the couch.

132

...move.

141

142
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:56,797
exactly the way Joel and I had
it even though it made sense.

143
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,881
Joel and I made sense,

144
00:04:57,965 --> 00:04:59,299
and we all know
how that ended up.

145
00:04:59,383 --> 00:05:00,843
I want to walk into this bedroom

146
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:02,469
and feel
like this is my bedroom.

147
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:04,596
I don't want to feel
like this is where Joel and I

148
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:07,599
kind of often... you know.

149
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:09,226
I know.
Plus, he dumped me here.

150
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,061
He stood right there.
I stood here.

151
00:05:11,145 --> 00:05:12,187
Now it's all different,

152
00:05:12,271 --> 00:05:13,707
because where he stood
when he dumped me is now

153
00:05:13,731 --> 00:05:15,000
where the dresser is,
and where I stood

154
00:05:15,024 --> 00:05:16,334
when he dumped me
is where part of the bed is,

155
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:17,544
which is a great comfort to me.

156
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:18,777
So...

157
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:20,487
what do you think?

158
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:21,840
I think you should put it back
the way it was

159
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:23,991
because this
is clinically insane.

160
00:05:24,074 --> 00:05:25,284
Imogene, I was hurt here.

161
00:05:25,367 --> 00:05:26,869
I know, twice. Shin, toe.

162
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,829
By Joel.
I know.

163
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:31,457
But put it all back
exactly the way it was.

164
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,667
Nice and pretty.
And the new thing?

165
00:05:33,751 --> 00:05:34,978
Now when you're here,
you're alone.

166

And you get both closets.

167
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:38,172
No. I'm gonna live with this
for a while

168
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,256
and see how it feels.

169
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,883
Shit-fuck.

170
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:42,009

I-I was told

185
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:13,987
the meeting started at 10:00.
<font color="#80FF00">GABE:</font> You are not late.

not because their wives

188

She didn't kick me out.

189

She just wouldn't let me in.

informally commenced.

Everyone, this is
the notorious Abe Weissman,

Hi, Abe. How you doing, Abe?
Good to see you.

00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:30,581
You know your arts editor,
Terrence.

Bernie's news.
Jerry's city desk.

196

Leonard's opinion,
and he occasionally has one.

I made the mistake

198
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:40,776
of showing them my collection
of Superman comics.

it's because she told Norman

Three?

No.

to that figure?

At the library on 42nd.

You read every back issue?

231
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:43,255
All but November 13 of '57.

Yes. What?

It's identical.

326
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:57,783
The overloaded Esther diaper poopy bathroom.
Good grief.

327
00:10:57,866 --> 00:11:00,077
We'll share. The-the bathrooms
will be communal

328
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,953

together.

Papa. Abe.

331
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:08,144
You thought you could
just bring us over here

332
00:11:08,168 --> 00:11:10,045
and play some music
and get us drunk,

333

and a nice dinner

334
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:13,924
and a cheap piano?

335
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,717
That's probably not even
in tune.

336

is valid.

of you two. Pay you back

340

and raising me" thing.

this place back, Miriam.

He does have a point there.

344
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,541
It does make you less feminine.
Sorry.

345
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:37,155
Let me just hike up my shorts
and get in a good man scratch.

346
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:39,533
Now, what was that again?
If we're going to eat,

347

This apartment,
this neighborhood.

It's like your Willoughby,

We told people we were

moving out of our old apartment
due to Abe leaving Columbia

388
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:55,484
and that the fabulous apartment

00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,003
we rented to replace it
fell through,

390
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,947
and we were in litigation
with the seedy landlord

391
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:01,072
to get our deposit check back.
Mr. Crink.

Who?
The seedy landlord. You don't listen.

the logical cover story

is that Abe and I
bought the place back for you.

It is. On what?

409
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:34,582
That you're moving in here
with us. Right, Abe?

00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:38,334
Here. At the insurance office.
Hi, Marcie.

650
00:23:38,417 --> 00:23:39,919
<font color="#80FF00">MARCIE:</font> Hi.
What insurance office?

651
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:42,338
Our insurance office, dope.

652
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,966
Tess, how is it you're working
at our insurance office?

653
00:23:45,049 --> 00:23:46,759
Mr. B hired me.
To do what?

654
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:48,678
To be a secretary person.

655
00:23:48,761 --> 00:23:51,222
Impossible.
Look, I did what you said.

656
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:52,974
I slept with Mr. B,
and he was like,

657
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:54,392
"Okay, the check's yours.

658
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:55,953
You'll have it Friday.
Let's do it again."

659
00:23:55,977 --> 00:23:56,978
Okay, for the record,

660
00:23:57,061 --> 00:23:58,455
I did not tell you
to sleep with him.

661
00:23:58,479 --> 00:23:59,647
I thought you did.

662
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,983
I said "flirt."
I didn't say "sleep."

663
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:03,943
Anyway,
now we're seeing each other,

664
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,444
so he was like,
"You want a job?"

665
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:08,072
And I said, "Yeah, as long as
I don't have to work that hard."

666
00:24:08,156 --> 00:24:10,741
And he said, "No problem."
I just need to do stuff to him

667
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:12,493
in the bathroom
during lunch sometimes,

668
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:13,744
but I'm good with that.

669
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:15,246
I'm sorry,
let me get this straight.

670
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:17,874
You are working at the insurance
office that we defrauded

671
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:20,334
and occasionally doing stuff
to the insurance agent

672
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:22,420
who's now technically
in on the fraud?

673
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:24,672
That's what happens sometimes
when you sleep with guys.

674
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:26,549
I did not tell you
to sleep with the guy!

675
00:24:26,632 --> 00:24:29,260
Don't yell. Come on,
you started the whole thing

676
00:24:29,343 --> 00:24:30,803
when you stole
your client's money.

677
00:24:30,887 --> 00:24:33,055
I didn't steal it.
I borrowed it.

678
00:24:33,139 --> 00:24:35,600
But if you borrow it
without telling someone,

679
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:36,976
isn't that stealing?

680
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:38,060
Are you at the office now

681
00:24:38,144 --> 00:24:39,163
where people can hear you?

682
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:40,855
Yeah. What's shaking, Kyle?

683
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:42,148
Then shut the fuck up!

684
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:43,357
What a hothead.

685
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:45,276
I got to go.
Say hello to your husband.

686
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:47,612
Oh, sure.
He's thrilled I got a job.

687
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:50,114
Just get me that check pronto.

00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,663
<font color="#80FF00">MIDGE:</font> It's me.

691
00:24:57,747 --> 00:24:59,707
Miriam? You sound weird.

692
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,709
They wouldn't increase
my milk tab.

693
00:25:01,792 --> 00:25:03,502
Your what?
My milk tab.

694
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:05,338
They'd increase it for Joel
but not for me

695
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:07,065
because the original credit
wasn't under my name.

696
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:08,758
So now to get milk,
I have to pay money,

697
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:12,053
and I don't know why I'm
taking it so badly, but I am.

698
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:14,281
I'm sorry, they let you get milk
without paying for it?

699
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:15,825
How the fuck
did I not know about this?

700
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,075
I don't know. Susie, yesterday,

701
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:18,559
I was feeling
on top of the world,

702
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:20,937
and right now I'm feeling
like nothing is gonna work out.

703
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,980
I was fucking insane
to take this apartment,

704
00:25:23,064 --> 00:25:25,441
and my mother's
turning my kitchen upside down,

705
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:29,028
and my father's in the bathroom,
topless, using my lipstick.

706
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:31,364
Wait, what?
Why did I buy this apartment?

707
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:33,783
Correction. I didn't buy it.
My parents bought it,

708
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,094
which makes me the schnorrer,
and I don't even get credit.

709
00:25:36,118 --> 00:25:37,703
Any kind of credit.

710
00:25:37,787 --> 00:25:39,848
And I pinched my daughter.
I should be up on charges.

711
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:40,998
You want me to come over?

712
00:25:41,082 --> 00:25:42,792
Oh, and you know L. Roy Dunham

713
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,585
slammed me in his column again?

714
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:47,004
Yeah, I saw it.
He was raving

715
00:25:47,088 --> 00:25:48,899
about some comic at the Copa
and said the guy's act

716
00:25:48,923 --> 00:25:51,175
was unlike
the unfunny meanderings

717
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:53,427
of no one's favorite
Mrs. Maisel.

718
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:54,553
He writes about me

719
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:56,264
even when he's not writing
about me.

720
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:58,891
Actually, he said,
"The deeply unfunny meanderings

721
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:00,768
of no one's favorite
Mrs. Maisel."

722
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:02,770
You memorized it?
No, I have the paper.

723
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,665
Look, the guy's a dickhead.
Just forget about him.

724
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:06,732
Wait till he hears
I can't afford milk for my kids.

725
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:10,319
They'll be short and arthritic,
and Imogene will come

726
00:26:10,403 --> 00:26:12,989
and arrange their kitchens
for them and the Lollipop Guild,

727
00:26:13,072 --> 00:26:15,133
and Ethan's gonna get made fun
of every day of his life

728
00:26:15,157 --> 00:26:16,885
because I couldn't get him milk
for his cereal.

729
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:20,162
That's what's happening.
That is my life.

Why are you grunting?

731

00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,310
in a different place,
but, of course,

733
00:26:25,334 --> 00:26:26,687
it doesn't work there.
It's got to go

734
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:28,921
back where it was when Joel,
who's got

735
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:31,549
this phenomenal credit history
with the milk company,

736
00:26:31,632 --> 00:26:33,134
lived here,
which wasn't the point.

737
00:26:33,217 --> 00:26:36,053
And I-I really burned a bridge
with Gus.

738
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:37,888
"Cow piss."

739
00:26:37,972 --> 00:26:39,223
I'm a monster.

740
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:40,867
You know what's gonna happen,
don't you?

741
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,560
What?
I'm either gonna wind up

742
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:44,363
married to Joel again,
although I don't know

743
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:45,914
how his girlfriend's gonna feel
about that,

744
00:26:45,938 --> 00:26:47,207
or I better start
trolling hospitals

745
00:26:47,231 --> 00:26:48,858
for a nice doctor right now,

746
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:51,694
because this is not good.

747
00:26:51,777 --> 00:26:54,280
I got some milk here. I can
bring it. It's only a week old.

748
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:55,489
No, thank you.

749
00:26:55,573 --> 00:26:57,033

get off the phone

750
00:26:57,116 --> 00:27:00,369

754
00:27:25,644 --> 00:27:27,271

heart attacks on a stick.

Four? Five?

757
00:27:31,776 --> 00:27:33,861
Let's see, the first one was Susan.
Sandra.

758
00:27:33,944 --> 00:27:35,404
Thought the last one was Sandra.

759
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:37,114
I married two Sandras.

00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:38,407
You're making it difficult.

761
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:40,826
The first Sandra
was a dope fiend.

762
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:43,412
Then Dotty.
She left you for Hal Roach.

763
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:46,082
Then you went international
with the flamenco dancer,

764
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,125
Conchita what's-her-name.

765
00:27:48,209 --> 00:27:49,627
She also left you for Hal Roach.

766
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,129
Then the second Sandra
with the bouncing bazoombas.

767
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:54,298
Now, was there one
between Dotty and Conchita?

Look, Susie,
if-if you want to walk with me,

00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:58,719
walk with me, all right?
Don't fucking stalk me.

A gift from Gleason.

796
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:58,779
And look at this view.
It's beautiful, isn't it?

797

of the three penthouses

What?

800
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:08,747
You got her on Broadway.

801
00:29:08,831 --> 00:29:11,750
But it was a disaster.
The Hindenburg times six.

802
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:14,044
But if Sophie
was a little less crazy

803
00:29:14,128 --> 00:29:16,422
and if you had just gotten her
past opening night,

804

Wasn't meant to be.

I don't know,

1288
00:47:13,456 --> 00:47:15,667
What's this?
The money you lent me

1289
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,550
to reimburse the money
I was holding for Midge

1290
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:19,963

Gambled away.

1291
00:47:20,046 --> 00:47:22,048
What about that guy
at the insurance company?

1292
00:47:22,131 --> 00:47:24,717
He still coming after you?
Oh, my sister's blowing him

1293

in the office bathroom every day
at lunch, so we're good.

We are squared away. Hmm?

Less than that
