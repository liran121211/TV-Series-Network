Oh, yeah.
I called the owner,

176
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,085
and he cleared it
with the management,

177
00:07:22,109 --> 00:07:24,088
and they ran it up
the flagpole to the board.

178
00:07:24,112 --> 00:07:25,630
All right.

179
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:27,424
I love that suddenly
you're all concerned

180
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:30,135
about not pissing anybody off.

181
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:33,222
I stashed this stuff here
last time I was hiding out.

182
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:35,390
Hey, do you have any seltzer?
Why?

183
00:07:35,414 --> 00:07:37,476
Thought I'd try to get
the stain out with seltzer.

184
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,519
Oh. Try gasoline.
Really?

185
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:41,981
Yeah. That and a match
will take that stain right out.

186
00:07:42,005 --> 00:07:44,984
Hilarious.
You should open for Shy Baldwin.

187
00:07:45,008 --> 00:07:46,985
So, pick a spot?

188
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:48,903
Yep. Anywhere you want.

189
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:51,364
Actually, I need to sleep over there.
Okay.

190
00:07:51,388 --> 00:07:53,554
It's just, I had a nightmare
when I slept over there.

191
00:07:53,578 --> 00:07:55,744
And over there, different
nightmare but just as bad.

192
00:07:55,768 --> 00:07:57,078
Over there, too.

193
00:07:57,102 --> 00:07:58,914
So I'd like to sleep there,
in the middle,

194
00:07:58,938 --> 00:08:00,415
if that's okay.
Uh...

195
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,751
Eh, even if it's not okay,
I got to sleep in the middle.

196
00:08:02,775 --> 00:08:04,919
But anywhere else, your choice.

197
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,131
So I have my choice
of all the nightmare spots.

198
00:08:07,155 --> 00:08:09,257

Yeah.

that less than two years later

I'd end up back here
drunk and in my underwear again?

211

with Jack Ballard.

He's doing the rest of the tour

So I don't got
to read this now, right?

252
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:49,813
They planned this. They gave
this to the papers yesterday,

253
00:10:49,837 --> 00:10:51,962
and they still made us come
all the way down to the tarmac

just to see us stand there
like a couple of assholes.

00:10:54,447 --> 00:10:56,508
Jack Ballard.
I thought Jack Ballard was dead.

256
00:10:56,532 --> 00:10:58,197
They wanted to humiliate us.

257
00:10:58,221 --> 00:10:59,886
I think I went to his funeral.

00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,472

and he's gonna know

262
00:11:06,376 --> 00:11:07,769
that I was fired.
So what?

263
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:09,980
He loaned me the money
to buy back my old apartment,

264
00:11:10,004 --> 00:11:11,773
my collateral being my contract

265
00:11:11,797 --> 00:11:13,483
for the tour
and the Christmas special.

266
00:11:13,507 --> 00:11:15,986
He was so excited
about the Christmas special.

267
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:19,156
You bought back
your old apartment?

268
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,032
Yes.
When?

269
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,201

I was with you yesterday.

I can't believe this.

I leave you alone
for four hours,

272
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:28,665
and you blow your career
and buy an apartment.

273
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:30,291
You said I didn't blow
my career.

274
00:11:30,315 --> 00:11:32,836
Why would you buy an apartment?
You don't have any money!

275
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,255
What do you mean,
I don't have any money?

276
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:37,298
You have some money, clearly.

277
00:11:37,322 --> 00:11:40,052
I saved every cent from the first part of the tour.
I know.

278
00:11:40,076 --> 00:11:42,536
And I am holding it for you.
I just...

279
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,474
Why would you buy back
your apartment?

280
00:11:45,498 --> 00:11:47,058
Because I don't want to live

281
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:50,144
with my ex-in-laws
in Queens anymore.

282
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:51,814
Look, I know it was
an emotional purchase,

283
00:11:51,838 --> 00:11:53,272
but I did it, it's done.

284
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:54,941
And now I need to get something

285
00:11:54,965 --> 00:11:57,801

00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:07,936

290
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:11,541

291
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:14,335
I don't have
my ledger book on me.

292
00:12:14,359 --> 00:12:16,547
I just got to look
at the ledger at least,

293
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:18,173
make sure things are ledgered.

294
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:19,674

295
00:12:19,698 --> 00:12:23,470

Okay.

297
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:27,850

298
00:12:27,874 --> 00:12:29,268

some hairspray.

299

Absolutely.
Okay.

300
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:32,980

get to the bank.

and unfeeling

508
00:20:50,813 --> 00:20:53,188
and... Wait,
did you change my birthday?

509
00:20:53,212 --> 00:20:55,105
No. Listen, Miriam,

510
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:57,484
we have to wrap things up here
and get to Coney Island.

511
00:20:57,508 --> 00:20:59,778
Ethan!
Wish your son a happy birthday.

512
00:20:59,802 --> 00:21:01,886
It's not his...
Ethan!

513
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:05,491
Hi, Mommy. I got

514
00:21:05,515 --> 00:21:06,930
a fire truck, cowboy guns

515
00:21:06,954 --> 00:21:08,369
and a baseball.
Ethan.

516
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:09,829
We're gonna ride
the Wonder Wheel.

517
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:11,288
Honey, all of that is exciting,

518
00:21:11,312 --> 00:21:13,792
but today
is just not your actual...

519
00:21:13,816 --> 00:21:15,377
Happy birthday, baby.

520
00:21:15,401 --> 00:21:17,252

I'm Susie Myerson.
This is my sister, Tess.

And how are you this morning?

529
00:21:36,526 --> 00:21:37,690
Fine. We just need our check.

530
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:39,129
Well, let me
have a look-see here.

531
00:21:39,153 --> 00:21:40,567
Ah, you're Mr. Frick's clients.

532
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:41,860
Yes, we are.
Does he have the check?

533
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:43,363
Why don't you have a
seat, and I'll buzz him for you.

534
00:21:43,387 --> 00:21:44,987
Tell him to bring the check.
Will do.

535
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:47,700
You have to relax.

536
00:21:47,724 --> 00:21:49,744
I'll relax when I get that check.

Well, technically, I'm a Dooley.
Nobody cares.

Uh, hello, Mr. Frick.
We are here for the check.

No, we're fine.
Do you have any hot chocolate?

543
00:22:02,989 --> 00:22:05,051
You want a balloon, too?
We'll just take the check.

Yeah.

Okay.
Let's see what we have here.

565
00:23:22,611 --> 00:23:25,089
We just came by
to pick up the check

566
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:27,884
like Mr. Frick told us to,
so that's why we're here.

567
00:23:27,908 --> 00:23:29,802
To get the check.

568
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:31,054

About what?

573
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,521
About the fire.

574
00:23:39,545 --> 00:23:41,231
Church.

575
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:42,940
Church?

576
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:45,088
Yeah.
That's where we usually are.

577
00:23:45,112 --> 00:23:47,236
Uh, in church
or going to church,

578
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,780

<font color="#80FF00">BARTOSIEWICZ</font>: Mm-hmm.

Put me down for church, also.

581
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:54,368
Okay.

582
00:23:54,392 --> 00:23:56,954
So, you're both in church.

583
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:59,957
That's when, um,
Tess' husband found us there

584
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:02,647
and told us there was a fire.
It was very upsetting.

585
00:24:02,671 --> 00:24:05,338
Thank God we were in church,
where everyone's upset.

586
00:24:05,362 --> 00:24:07,340
And your husband
can corroborate this?

587
00:24:07,364 --> 00:24:09,490
Finding you both in church?

588
00:24:10,533 --> 00:24:12,970
He's drunk a lot.
<font color="#80FF00">TESS</font>: Mm.

589
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:14,722
So his memory gets fuzzy.
<font color="#80FF00">BARTOSIEWICZ</font>: Mm.

590
00:24:14,746 --> 00:24:17,141
Any idea how it started?

591
00:24:17,165 --> 00:24:19,018
The drinking?
Oh, that's a family thing.

592
00:24:19,042 --> 00:24:20,979
He's talking
about the fire, Tess.

593
00:24:21,003 --> 00:24:22,688
Any theories? Wild thoughts?

594
00:24:22,712 --> 00:24:25,191
Yeah, maybe Mom fell asleep
with a cigarette in her hand.

595
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:27,025
Yep, that does happen a lot.

596
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:29,821
Of course,
your mom is dead, so...

597
00:24:29,845 --> 00:24:31,823
<font color="#00FFFF">(WHISPERS)</font>
Right. I forgot.

598
00:24:31,847 --> 00:24:33,740

Bad wiring. Interesting.

602
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:43,751
So, is there, like,
an investigation going on or...?

603
00:24:43,775 --> 00:24:45,857
Just working the case.

604
00:24:45,881 --> 00:24:47,963
Case. So it's a case?

605
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,507
You know,
some neighbors reported

606
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:53,261
seeing a couple of women
paddling around in a rowboat

607
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:54,512
that night.
Women in a rowboat?

608
00:24:54,536 --> 00:24:55,762
What's this world coming to?

609
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:57,348
They said they were
drinking beer, laughing,

610
00:24:57,372 --> 00:24:59,349
singing, at one point.
Oh.

611
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:02,270
Do you have any idea
who those two women might be?

612
00:25:02,294 --> 00:25:05,148
No, we do not.
Yeah, beats me.

613
00:25:05,172 --> 00:25:08,275
Okay. Well, unfortunately,

614
00:25:08,299 --> 00:25:09,861
there's still some loose ends
we need to tie

615
00:25:09,885 --> 00:25:11,863
before we get that check out
to you,

616
00:25:11,887 --> 00:25:13,363
but we will be in touch.

617
00:25:13,387 --> 00:25:15,908
So no check today.
Not today. But...

618
00:25:15,932 --> 00:25:18,453
Denise did bring in
some of her coffee cake.

619
00:25:18,477 --> 00:25:20,871
I bet I could scrounge up
a piece.

620
00:25:20,895 --> 00:25:24,000
Ooh.
Hey, how about a good faith down payment?

621
00:25:24,024 --> 00:25:25,877
You know,
ten percent to show you care?

622
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:27,962
Wouldn't that be nice, huh?

623
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:29,403
Yeah.

624
00:25:32,198 --> 00:25:34,200
Hey, so, can we leave?

625
00:25:35,785 --> 00:25:37,787

630
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:59,452
So, what, you think they're not
gonna give us the check?

631
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:00,662

they're gonna call the cops.

632

636
00:26:06,399 --> 00:26:07,669
Do you think
we're gonna go to jail?

637
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:09,044
I-I don't want to go to jail.

638
00:26:09,068 --> 00:26:10,963

Of the two of us,

646
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:29,524
there's only one he wanted
to bend over that desk.

Well, that's nice.

We need to flip this guy,
Tess. Okay?

649
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:36,239
He has to be convinced
to overlook the fact that we are

in the entire world.

651
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:39,574
No. There have to be worse.

652
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,953
Take one for the team?
Get this guy on our side?

653
00:26:41,977 --> 00:26:43,642
By doing what?
The same thing you did

654
00:26:43,666 --> 00:26:45,487
that got
our high school principal fired.

655
00:26:45,511 --> 00:26:47,332
I'm a married woman,
for Christ's sake.

656
00:26:47,356 --> 00:26:49,419
If that meant anything to you
at all, I wouldn't ask.

657
00:26:49,443 --> 00:26:50,669
You think I'm a whore?

658
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:52,297
That I ain't got
a line in the sand?

659
00:26:52,321 --> 00:26:54,047

660

665
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:05,310

Thank you.

838
00:33:26,506 --> 00:33:28,609
We've come to a dead stop here,
Shirley.

839
00:33:28,633 --> 00:33:30,443
And for Rose and for me.

840
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:32,487
We can give out ice cream
and walk at the same time,

841
00:33:32,511 --> 00:33:34,532
can't we?
<font color="#80FF00">ETHAN</font>: Grandma, Grandma. And finally...

By the time we get there...

844
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:40,162
Wait, no ice cream for me?
You don't eat ice cream.

845
00:33:40,186 --> 00:33:42,248
You don't eat anything,
and she got you one.

846
00:33:42,272 --> 00:33:43,708
I got to get something to drink.

847
00:33:43,732 --> 00:33:45,376
We'll lose the others.

848
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,067
Oh, they'll be back.

849
00:33:48,444 --> 00:33:50,256
You know,
I schtupped your mother

850
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:51,632
under this very boardwalk.

851
00:33:51,656 --> 00:33:53,007
Thank you for that.

852
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,052
Just thought you'd like
a little family history.

853
00:33:55,076 --> 00:33:56,910
Two.
<font color="#80FF00">VENDOR</font>: You got it.

854
00:33:58,078 --> 00:33:59,994
Everything okay at the club?

855
00:34:00,018 --> 00:34:01,933
Fine. Why would you say that?

856
00:34:01,957 --> 00:34:04,060
You got a look
all Maisel men get

857
00:34:04,084 --> 00:34:06,564
when they got work troubles
or prostate issues.

858
00:34:06,588 --> 00:34:08,398
I just...

859
00:34:08,422 --> 00:34:09,858
got these landlords,

860
00:34:09,882 --> 00:34:11,818
and they're a little upset
with me.

861
00:34:11,842 --> 00:34:14,029
Why?
The club's drawing too much attention

862
00:34:14,053 --> 00:34:15,280
to their other business.

863
00:34:15,304 --> 00:34:17,261
You know, downstairs?
Ah, yes.

864
00:34:17,285 --> 00:34:19,243
I can't be at war
with these people.

865
00:34:19,267 --> 00:34:20,827
For many reasons.

866
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:22,954
Then you got to pay 'em.
I do pay them.

867
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,810
Not rent, you yutz. Payola.
Give 'em a taste.

868
00:34:24,834 --> 00:34:26,823
I don't think
that's what they're looking for.

869
00:34:26,847 --> 00:34:28,836
Of course it is.
There's not a thing in the world

870
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:31,088
that money can't fix.
You see your son?

871
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:32,986
Had a fit to win
that Popeye doll

872
00:34:33,010 --> 00:34:34,883
at the whack-a-mole game
back there.

873
00:34:34,907 --> 00:34:37,344
You think he's really such
a terrific whack-a-mole player?

874
00:34:37,368 --> 00:34:39,555
You saw him. All he hit
was the kid next to him.

875
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:41,055
I slip the guy five bucks,

876
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,120
suddenly, Ethan's the king
of whack-a-mole.

877
00:34:43,144 --> 00:34:45,300
Five bucks. Got the doll.
What did we learn?

878
00:34:45,324 --> 00:34:47,480
Nothing. Including
how to play whack-a-mole.

879
00:34:47,504 --> 00:34:49,481
<font color="#80FF00">ROSE</font>: Abe, please.
It was an accident.

880
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:51,900
You saw we took a wrong turn
and said nothing.

881
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:55,070
And now we have to double back
around the Parachute Jump,

882
00:34:55,094 --> 00:34:57,239
and if we get vomited on
from the sky,

883
00:34:57,263 --> 00:34:58,656
it's on your head. Stop that.

884
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,409
This is a wonderful camera,
Mr. Weissman.

885
00:35:00,433 --> 00:35:01,659
I'm glad you like it. Keep up.

886
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:03,390
I got beautiful shots
of the boardwalk

887
00:35:03,414 --> 00:35:05,215
and the ocean
and very funny pony rides.

888
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:07,040
Double-time, double-time.
I was thinking

889
00:35:07,064 --> 00:35:09,585
we could get one all together?
Absolutely not.

890
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:11,377
Hello. We need, uh...

891
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,506

they were my parents,

this wasn't a shakedown.

the rent they're charging you

next year, however.

915
00:35:58,074 --> 00:35:59,844

00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,736
That's very disturbing to hear,
Miriam.

995
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,153
Especially as your lender.

996
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:06,989
I know, Moishe.
Wait, what did you say?

997
00:39:07,013 --> 00:39:08,239
I'm sorry, Moishe!

998
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:09,449
Did he say "as your lender"?

999
00:39:09,473 --> 00:39:10,825
<font color="#80FF00">MIDGE</font>: I will make it up
to you, Moishe!

1000
00:39:10,849 --> 00:39:12,514
What does that mean,
"as your lender"?

1001
00:39:12,538 --> 00:39:14,203
Your contract
was your collateral.

1002
00:39:14,227 --> 00:39:15,955
Do you know
what collateral is, Miriam?

1003
00:39:15,979 --> 00:39:17,708
I do, but you're going
to tell me anyway.

1004
00:39:17,732 --> 00:39:19,042
Collateral
is that thing you used

1005
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:20,960
to get me to sell you
that apartment back!

1006
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:23,297
What apartment?
<font color="#80FF00">MOISHE</font>: Your contract had numbers

1007
00:39:23,321 --> 00:39:24,464
indicating money.

1008
00:39:24,488 --> 00:39:26,445
And a Christmas special
with Bob Hope.

1009
00:39:26,469 --> 00:39:28,426
Remember the Christmas special,
Miriam?

1010
00:39:28,450 --> 00:39:31,430
The Christmas special never had
Bob Hope in it, Moishe.

1011
00:39:31,454 --> 00:39:33,139
What apartment?
Our apartment.

1012
00:39:33,163 --> 00:39:35,245
Our apartment?
You bought our apartment?

1013
00:39:35,269 --> 00:39:37,351
<font color="#80FF00">MIDGE</font>: Yes,
I bought our apartment.

1014
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,063
<font color="#80FF00">JOEL</font>: And you borrowed money
from my father?

1015
00:39:39,087 --> 00:39:40,731
Why is that bad?
It's not.

1016
00:39:40,755 --> 00:39:41,856
It sure as fuck is!

1017
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,942
I don't understand.
What did she buy?

1018
00:39:43,966 --> 00:39:45,443
<font color="#80FF00">ROSE</font>: She bought her apartment!

1019
00:39:45,467 --> 00:39:48,030
<font color="#80FF00">ABE</font>: What apartment?
<font color="#80FF00">JOEL</font>: Our apartment, Abe!

1020
00:39:48,054 --> 00:39:49,740
You don't have an apartment.

1021
00:39:49,764 --> 00:39:51,449
Their old apartment, Abe!

1022
00:39:51,473 --> 00:39:53,389
I can't believe you borrowed
money from my father!

1023
00:39:53,413 --> 00:39:55,329
Joel, I'm not going to mention
that I picked up

1024
00:39:55,353 --> 00:39:57,747
on a very insulting tone there,
but I did.

1025
00:39:57,771 --> 00:39:59,458
<font color="#80FF00">JOEL</font>: Why would you do that?
<font color="#80FF00">ABE</font>: Why would you do that?

1026
00:39:59,482 --> 00:40:01,167
Because I loved that apartment!

1027
00:40:01,191 --> 00:40:03,294
Because I was happy
in that apartment.

1028
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:06,173
I want the kids to grow up
in that apartment.

1029
00:40:06,197 --> 00:40:07,904
They won't have a yard!

1030
00:40:07,928 --> 00:40:09,634
<font color="#80FF00">MIDGE</font>: I know, Shirley!

1031
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:11,595
Can we get back to the point
that I was swindled

1032
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:13,262
and my son insulted me?

1033
00:40:13,286 --> 00:40:15,766
You did not get swindled.
I did not insult you,

1034
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:17,580
and she didn't know
she was gonna get fired.

1035
00:40:17,604 --> 00:40:19,394
<font color="#80FF00">MOISHE</font>: She should've assumed.
Why?

1036
00:40:19,418 --> 00:40:20,978
Because you can't tell a joke.

1037
00:40:21,002 --> 00:40:23,315
I've told you that
over and over and over,

1038
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:25,108
but you just won't listen!

1039
00:40:25,132 --> 00:40:26,901
That's right! You won't!

1040
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:29,362
I will figure out a way
to get you your money.

1041
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:31,490
How much did you borrow?
<font color="#80FF00">MOISHE</font>: Why do you want to know?

1042
00:40:31,514 --> 00:40:33,742
I'm talking to Midge.
Would you like some privacy?

1043
00:40:33,766 --> 00:40:35,494
Maybe I can help her out.
<font color="#80FF00">MOISHE</font>: With what?

1044
00:40:35,518 --> 00:40:37,411
Sonja was not a matchmaker.

1045
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,539
Of course she was.
<font color="#80FF00">ABE</font>: No.

1046
00:40:39,563 --> 00:40:42,021
Matchmakers get paid.
No one paid her.

1047
00:40:42,045 --> 00:40:44,502
<font color="#80FF00">ROSE</font>: Your mother paid her.
What?

1048
00:40:44,526 --> 00:40:48,090
Abe, for God's sake,
you were 30 and unmarried!

1049
00:40:48,114 --> 00:40:49,882
Plus, your wardrobe.

1050
00:40:49,906 --> 00:40:51,864
They had to throw in
a savings bond

1051
00:40:51,888 --> 00:40:53,845
and a Turkish
ceremonial rifle set

1052
00:40:53,869 --> 00:40:56,223
for my father!
That's where he got that?

1053
00:40:56,247 --> 00:40:58,349
I need a pen. Who has a pen?

1054
00:40:58,373 --> 00:41:00,477
Aren't you supposed
to be prepared for anything?

1055

<font color="#80FF00">MIDGE</font>: That's the Boy Scouts,
Moishe.

1056
00:41:02,253 --> 00:41:04,147
I need to do some math here!

1057
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:07,067
You do not need to do any math!
You will get your money.

1058
00:41:07,091 --> 00:41:09,403
I don't believe you.
You think I'd lie to you

1059
00:41:09,427 --> 00:41:11,529
on my son's fake birthday?
What?

1060
00:41:11,553 --> 00:41:13,991
That was our apartment! You
should've discussed it with me.

1061
00:41:14,015 --> 00:41:15,784
Why?
At the very least, I could've told you

1062
00:41:15,808 --> 00:41:17,431
to never borrow money
from my father.

1063
00:41:17,455 --> 00:41:19,078
How did I become
the bad guy here?

1064
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:21,643
Where did you get the idea
to buy your apartment?

1065
00:41:21,667 --> 00:41:24,209
How did I wind up in a cage
with Petey and Jacob?!

1066
00:41:24,233 --> 00:41:25,919
This funnel cake is delicious.

1067
00:41:25,943 --> 00:41:27,879

That's a very dangerous height

1074
00:41:44,879 --> 00:41:47,190
to tell a Jewish man
he's been had!

1075
00:41:47,214 --> 00:41:49,276

a good height for a Catholic?

Okay?

1090
00:42:22,041 --> 00:42:24,874
"Take out the trash.
Fix the sink. Walk the dog."

1091

You got a dog?
"By the way, we got a dog."

I can to make it all up to her,

Have a good night.

00:42:33,886 --> 00:42:35,739
See you next time.
Plus, she's never home.

1096
00:42:35,763 --> 00:42:37,573
She's always
at secretarial school,

1097
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:39,701
which is probably
why the lists she leaves me

1098
00:42:39,725 --> 00:42:40,785
are so professional.

The dog. And I'm thinking about everything,

1101
00:42:45,481 --> 00:42:46,499
and I'm starting to get mad.

1102
00:42:46,523 --> 00:42:48,542
I decide to confront her.
Tonight.

1103
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,879
So, she comes home,
and I'm standing there,

1104
00:42:50,903 --> 00:42:52,296

00:42:54,490 --> 00:42:56,509
and I say,
"Imogene, we need to talk."

1107
00:42:56,533 --> 00:42:58,762
She says give her a minute.
She goes into the bedroom.

1108
00:42:58,786 --> 00:43:00,889
Two minutes later,
she comes out.

1109
00:43:00,913 --> 00:43:02,765
Completely naked.

1110
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:05,226
Imogene?
I am frozen. Speechless.

1111
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:08,605
And then she smiles and says,
"Have a great night at the club.

1112
00:43:08,629 --> 00:43:10,461
Tell Joel I said hello."

1113

Not the good, solid,
polished ones

1231
00:47:35,896 --> 00:47:37,790
but the ones that were epic.

1232
00:47:37,814 --> 00:47:40,001
You know, the first night
drunken tit-wagging show

1233
00:47:40,025 --> 00:47:42,378
comes to mind.
The Sophie Lennon showcase.

1234

That one still hurts.
But epic, right?

1235
00:47:44,779 --> 00:47:47,842

enough power

1248

to say to them,
"I want to be me"?

1249
00:48:13,182 --> 00:48:15,703
What if they never let me be me?
They will.

1250
00:48:15,727 --> 00:48:18,081
I want to be me every time
I walk out on that stage.

1251

No. If I'm gonna do that,

I'm gonna say exactly
what's on my mind all the time.

I am gonna say something.

Yes. Fine.
Clearly, that is the goal.

1262

for a guy like Shy Baldwin

or Rosemary Clooney,

1264
00:48:49,218 --> 00:48:51,739
you may have to do
a room service joke.

1265
00:48:51,763 --> 00:48:54,283
Then no more opening act gigs.
What?

1266
00:48:54,307 --> 00:48:56,286
