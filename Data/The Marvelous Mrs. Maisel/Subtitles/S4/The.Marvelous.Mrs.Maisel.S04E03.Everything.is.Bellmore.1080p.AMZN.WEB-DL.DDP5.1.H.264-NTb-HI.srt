he got bit by a snake.

00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:02,274
Why don't you get back
to the group, Jean.

173
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,776
Miriam,
I'm trying to make a sale here.

174
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,653
And so am I. Beat it.

175
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:08,238
IMOGENE: She's making dinner,

176
00:08:08,322 --> 00:08:10,657
and in comes a burglar
with a gun.

177
00:08:10,741 --> 00:08:12,159
She screams, he shoots,

178
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,411
and the Tupperware she
was holding stops the bullet.

179
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,264
- (WOMEN GASP)
- I mean, they don't even mention that

180
00:08:16,288 --> 00:08:18,415
- in the literature.
- Imogene.

181
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:21,084
Dial it down, woman.

182
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:22,928
Midge, do you want to make
some sales or not?

183
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,397
- (PHONE RINGS)
- Yes. Showing them how to burp

184
00:08:24,421 --> 00:08:26,048
a two-quart
is not going to move product,

185
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,925
and you are here
to move product.

186
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:30,010
Now sell.

187
00:08:31,053 --> 00:08:33,213
Ladies, I think it's time
to get those order forms out.

188
00:08:33,263 --> 00:08:35,390
And when that is done,
I will announce the winner

189
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:37,643
of the silliest Tupperware hat.

190
00:08:37,726 --> 00:08:39,645
(WHISPERS INDISTINCTLY)

191
00:08:39,728 --> 00:08:41,104
Oh, my God.

192
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:42,940
What? Are you okay?

193
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:44,483
Uh...

194
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:47,110
Everyone, uh, please excuse me.

195
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:49,196
- Imogene?
- I got it.

196
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:52,783
Let's drop the bullshit, ladies,

197
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:54,785
and make some deals.

198
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,581
You need to eat.

199
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:01,226
- SUSIE: Mm-hmm.
- This hot plate is no good.

200
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,918
I don't think
all this is gonna fit.

201
00:09:03,001 --> 00:09:05,003
- How's that sandwich?
- Great.

202
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:06,672
Hot here, cold here.

203
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:08,799
MIDGE: Okay,
we're officially out of room.

204
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,634
What? No.
The pudding has to go in there.

205
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:12,403
- MIDGE: Don't think so.
- ZELDA: Oh, strudel.

206
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:13,929
Okay, we can freeze the chicken.

207
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,764
- Where's the freezer?
- MIDGE: Up there.

208
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:17,849
What is this place, the gulag?

209
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:19,851
Oh, I made Zelda mad.

210
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:22,038
- I didn't know you could make Zelda mad.
- Trade you.

211
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,856
All the lady magazines say
you should defrost once a month.

212
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,484
- This is crazy.
- Mmm, good coffee.

213
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,904
- ZELDA: Oh, you've got ants.
- You should've called me.

214
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:32,531
I called you.

215
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:34,658
I mean the minute you found out.

216
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:36,219
I don't want you sitting
in a dark apartment,

217
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,870
drinking for hours by yourself
at a time like this.

218
00:09:38,954 --> 00:09:40,223
- I'm here.
- SUSIE: Now you're mad

219
00:09:40,247 --> 00:09:42,833
- just like Zelda.
- I'm not mad.

220
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:46,169
Jackie's dead.

221
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:47,838
I know, honey.

222
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:51,925
Really?

223
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:54,303
He was here all alone, then bam.

224
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:57,180
Old Gianni upstairs
said he heard a thud.

225
00:09:57,264 --> 00:09:59,516
Called the cops.
They load him in the car,

226
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:02,227
and they took him to Bellevue,
and by 9:00, that was it.

227
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:05,272
- He's gone.
- Well, he wasn't sick.

228
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,941
He didn't suffer.
We should be grateful for that.

229
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:09,651
It was the chili dogs.

230
00:10:09,735 --> 00:10:12,029
I warned him
about those chili dogs.

231
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:14,740
Fucking guy
subsisted on chili dogs.

232
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:18,160
- The ice wins. We have to eat it all now.
- When's the service?

233
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,721
- Don't know.
- MIDGE: Well, how can I get a hold

234
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:21,204
- of his sister?
- Don't know.

235
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:22,914
- Did she leave a card?
- SUSIE: No.

236
00:10:22,998 --> 00:10:24,583
Maybe she wrote something down?

237
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:25,917
You have one fork?

238
00:10:26,001 --> 00:10:27,336
She didn't write anything down.

239
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,379
I don't know
where the funeral is.

240
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,757
I don't know where the sister is
or who the sister is.

241
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,092
I just know that last night,
when I wasn't here,

242
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:35,416
the biggest pain in my ass ever

243
00:10:35,469 --> 00:10:37,971
dropped the fuck dead
in my apartment!

246
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:48,774
I'm sorry.

247
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:50,817
I'm sorry, too.

248
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:52,611
I don't want to stay
in this apartment.

249
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:54,237
Somebody died here. It's creepy.

250
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,239
CHESTER: Mm,
it's not the first time.

251
00:10:56,323 --> 00:10:57,991
Huh?

252
00:10:58,075 --> 00:10:59,785
There's been a lot of deaths
in this room.

253
00:10:59,868 --> 00:11:01,119
What?

254
00:11:01,203 --> 00:11:02,764
CHESTER: I researched
the apartment's history

255
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:05,665
- at the municipal archives before I moved in.
- Why?

256
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,143
Because that's
the first thing you do

257
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,710
before you move
into an apartment.

258
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:10,730
- No, it's not.
- CHESTER: There was a decapitation.

259
00:11:10,754 --> 00:11:14,341
A woman was eaten alive
by maggots.

260
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,760
Identical twins
were disemboweled to music.

261
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,763
A pipe exploded,
drowning an entire family.

262
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:20,948
Then there's the crib deaths.

263
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:23,392
Chester. Just eat your eggs.

264
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:24,851

265
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:26,645

right in this corner.

266
00:11:26,728 --> 00:11:29,398
Maybe don't rush me.

267
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:35,070
ZELDA: I hope it's enough.

268
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,363
Mr. Moishe likes squash.

269
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:38,365
Ah, I didn't make enough squash.

270
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,534
I will skip the squash
so there's squash for Moishe.

271
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:42,297
It's so nice
that we're all together again.

272

Oh, Zelda, no.
You've been crying for two days.

only Moishe-y knew him.

274
00:11:48,792 --> 00:11:51,586

him at some point, Moishe.

275
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:53,296
We know his family
from the Catskills.

276
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,690
MOISHE: I know
the parents a little.

277
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,442
And the grandfather.
Saw him in the shower once

278
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:58,885
after racquetball. Wrinkliest
nutsack I've ever seen.

279
00:11:58,969 --> 00:12:00,512
And he's seen some beauts.

280
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,764
- Oh, dear.
- We're talking about the bar mitzvah boy?

281
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:05,559
Akiva? Mm-hmm. Moishe was asked
to do an aliyah at his service,

282
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:07,495
- and he swears he's never met him.
- MOISHE: And it's a short list

283
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,688
of people you pick to do
an aliyah at your bar mitzvah.

284
00:12:09,771 --> 00:12:11,791
You'd think you'd pick someone
that knows who the fuck you are.

285
00:12:11,815 --> 00:12:14,317
Well, it's nice
just to be wanted by someone.

00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:15,819

287
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:18,488

Abe and I will visit soon,
Shirley. I promise.

289
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,658
Tuesday?

290
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,034
I don't know about Tuesday.

291
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,619
Wednesday? I'll make my cabbage.

292
00:12:24,703 --> 00:12:26,455
It'll be soon. You have my word.

293
00:12:26,538 --> 00:12:29,124
Your word is fairly meaningless,
Rose. You know it, I know it.

00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:31,168
- So let's set a date. (DOOR OPENS)
- JOEL: Hello!

- The youth have returned. (DOOR CLOSES)
- MOISHE: Ethan!

296
00:12:33,253 --> 00:12:34,897
Come here. Grandpa's
got to pick your brain.

297
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,757
- Saw Abe coming up behind me.
- His hours are

298
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:40,385
- so unpredictable these days.
- Wow, look at this place.

299
00:12:40,469 --> 00:12:42,179
It's all back together.

300
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:44,306
This is new.
The old one was chipped.

301
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:45,669
I remember
when Ethan chipped it.

302
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:47,524
MOISHE: Akiva Bergman.
It doesn't ring a bell,

303
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,977
- huh?
- ETHAN: No.

304
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,413
- Don't rush. Think, think.
- ZELDA: I've got

305
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,317
dinner for you and Esther
in the kitchen, Ethan.

306
00:12:52,355 --> 00:12:54,208
- (VOICE BREAKING) Say good night.
- ETHAN: Good night.

307
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,401
- Good night.
- SHIRLEY: Maybe you bought the kid

308
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:58,737
an ice cream once, huh?
You know, and it was so special.

309
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,238
It really meant something.

310
00:13:00,322 --> 00:13:01,924
MOISHE: I don't go around
the Catskills buying ice cream

311
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:03,533
for little boys I don't know.

312
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:05,178
There's plenty of those guys
crawling around up there,

313
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:06,721
- you know what I'm saying? (LAUGHS)
- ROSE: No.

314
00:13:06,745 --> 00:13:08,306
- What are you saying?
- SHIRLEY: You remember Daniel Sandberg?

315
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,873
With the Coke-bottle glasses?

316
00:13:09,956 --> 00:13:11,791
ROSE: I do.
He'd drive up with his mother.

317
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:13,335
Called him Danny Deep-Pockets.

318
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:16,046
Went around asking boys to dig
in his pants for candy corn.

319
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:17,297
I knew nothing about this.

320
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:19,132
SHIRLEY: Then there was Tom
from Buffalo

321
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:22,260
- with the girly bangs.
- They called him Tommy Touch-Butt.

322
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:24,184
- ROSE: You're making this up.
- (MIDGE GRUNTS)

you remember Susie?

00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:30,602
- From Yom Kippur?
- Hello. Hi.

325
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:31,685
What's going on?

326
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:33,188
- A guy died.
- Oh, my God.

327
00:13:33,271 --> 00:13:35,148
- Who? Your husband?
- Uh, her roommate.

328
00:13:35,232 --> 00:13:36,858
Jackie from the Gaslight.

329
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:39,444
Shit. I knew him. What happened?

330
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:40,862
I just told you.
He fucking died.

331
00:13:40,946 --> 00:13:42,239

00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,008

lot of people in my apartment.

ROSE: Abe. Just in time to eat.

336
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:50,288
Did you not see me behind you?

337
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:52,052
- Yeah, but...
- Let's eat, everyone. Yeah.

338
00:13:52,082 --> 00:13:54,143
- Before it gets cold. Oh, yeah.
- I had to stand there

00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:57,170
and watch the elevator
take you up to the ninth floor,

340
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:58,505
stop, come back down.

341
00:13:58,588 --> 00:14:00,882
Then I had to get on,
take it back up.

342
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:02,842
That's 27 floors.

343
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:05,303
You'll survive, Papa.
It's family style, everyone.

344
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:06,972
Forget your manners and dive in.

345
00:14:07,055 --> 00:14:08,932
Well, good thing I made it,

346
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,476
because I have a fun piece
of news for everyone.

347
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,240
- ROSE: Oh, let's hear it.
- (ABE CHUCKLES)

348
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:14,771
I've been... I've...

349
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,148
- (CRYING)
- I've been assigned...

350
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:19,568
- Why is Zelda crying?
- I didn't make enough squash,

351
00:14:19,651 --> 00:14:21,486
- and I'm just so happy.
- MIDGE: We're good

352
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,572
from here, Zelda.
Why don't you take a break.

353
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:27,200
So, the Village Voice
has assigned me,

354
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:28,827
its chief theater critic,

355
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:31,162
to review a new Broadway musical

356
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:33,623
by our own Buzz Goldberg.

357
00:14:33,707 --> 00:14:35,027
- ROSE: My God.
- Buzz has a show?

358
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:36,585
- Like, a real show?
- Yeah.

359
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:38,468
That musical he's been
workshopping at Steiner

360
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:39,921
for, what, eight years now?

361
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:43,258
It's a real success story.
Did very well in New Haven.

362
00:14:43,341 --> 00:14:46,011
- Has a lot of good buzz, pardon the pun.
- (ROSE LAUGHS)

363
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,447
- SHIRLEY: Ha! Good one.
- And there's an opening night ticket

364
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:49,671
for each and every one of you.

365
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,474
- Opening night.
- MIDGE: Fun.

366
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:52,767
Abe, what a score.

367
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,394
I already don't have
anything to wear.

368
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:57,230
I'm so proud of Buzz.
He never gave up on the show.

369
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:59,250
- We must have seen it at the resort about 20 times.
- ROSE: Mm.

370
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:01,318
And that song. You can't
get it out of your head.

371
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,962
You were in a version
of Buzz's show one year,

372
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:04,696
weren't you, Miriam?
Up at Steiner?

373
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:07,741
I played Clare Landsburg
in the summer of 1953.

374
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,075
And he dropped you, right?

375
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,953
No. I wasn't dropped.

376
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:13,455
I did the show for a while,

377
00:15:13,538 --> 00:15:15,290
and it went very well,
and then I made way

378
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:17,584
for another lucky young lady
to play the role.

379
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,812
I thought he dropped you
because you can't sing or act.

380
00:15:19,836 --> 00:15:21,397
MOISHE: Or dance.
That's how I remember it.

381
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:22,964
You couldn't sing
or act or dance.

382
00:15:23,048 --> 00:15:24,633
Please, people.
She's no Judy Garland,

383
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:26,176
but she gave it her best shot.

384
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,011
Right. No, I'm not Judy Garland,

385
00:15:28,094 --> 00:15:30,472
but who is?
Besides Judy Garland.

386
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:31,907
And you froze that one time.
Remember?

387
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:34,309
You came out on stage.
You couldn't remember your line.

388
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:35,977
One time, Shirley.
I froze one time.

389
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,146
I'd seen the show so much
that I knew the line.

390
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:40,166
Everybody did. The whole room
was yelling out the line.

391
00:15:40,190 --> 00:15:42,275
I wasn't fired
from the show. Okay?

392
00:15:42,359 --> 00:15:45,111
- Is this all the squash?

regardless
of the elevator incident,

395
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:51,302
I'm not leaving you out. There's
a ticket for you, as well.

396
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:53,912
Two, actually,
if you'd like to bring a friend.

397
00:15:53,995 --> 00:15:55,330
Yeah, Joel. Bring a friend.

398

Archie or may... be
someone else.

399
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,127
There is no one else.
One ticket will suffice, Abe.

I still consider you

408
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:17,519
She's not divorced.
Her husband died.

her name. I know her number.

Okay, look, I need one of you
to stay with her.

00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,756
- What?
- There's no way I can take her to the pediatrician's

Yeah, I fucking heard
about Jackie.

it's rock paper scissors.

It's a kid's game
for God's sake.

532
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:28,019
But what if I chose heat?

533
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:30,164
- Heat would melt the scissors.
- And burn the paper.

534
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:32,065
So heat would beat
everything but rock.

535
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,816
Heat is not an option.

536

Water would rust the scissors
and ruin the paper.

- What about the other pages?

Now you are my daughter's
manager and a plumber

understand business.

I will send the gorgon
to my hairstylist,

600

and she will fix her hair.

601
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:50,850

about foundation

and mascara and lipstick
and deodorant,

603
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,767

and she will sit up straight,

and she will have a husband.

- And it's just whipped cream?

And a spoon.

612
00:23:12,183 --> 00:23:14,685
And I can just eat it? It
doesn't have to go on anything?

without the mole?

673
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:47,648
I made two rounds of the place.
No sign of Susie.

674
00:26:47,732 --> 00:26:49,900
Good. Three songs in,
she pulled out a bag of Cheetos

675
00:26:49,984 --> 00:26:51,878
and told everyone who shushed
her they'll be dead someday.

676
00:26:51,902 --> 00:26:53,321
It's good she's gone.

677
00:26:53,404 --> 00:26:55,281
There they are.
The ones that got away.

678
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:57,325
- Hi, Pauly.
- Hello, stranger.

679
00:26:57,408 --> 00:26:59,285
How are you, Pauly?

680
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:01,704
Brokenhearted without you
at the resort this year.

681
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:03,414
Maybe next year.

682
00:27:03,497 --> 00:27:04,832
How about our boy, huh?

683
00:27:04,915 --> 00:27:07,626
He had such big dreams,
but who knows from dreams.

684
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,338
"A dreamer is one who can
only find his way by moonlight."

- Oscar Wilde.
- And now look at me,

686
00:27:12,673 --> 00:27:15,009
a bigshot financial investor
in Buzz's dreams.

687
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:16,969
Pauly, you macher!

688
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:19,197
It's a small slice, but the
thing is, you hear that song,

689
00:27:19,221 --> 00:27:20,514
you take out your wallet.

690
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:22,391
- Uh-huh.
- EDIE: Miriam Maisel!

691
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:25,186
- Look at you, all dolled up.
- Hello, Edie. Good to see you.

692
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:27,980
I was just talking to someone.

693
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:31,192
You were the star of this show
one year, weren't you?

694
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:33,402
- Up at Steiner?
- Clare Landsburg,

695
00:27:33,486 --> 00:27:35,529
summer of '53, at your service.

696
00:27:35,613 --> 00:27:37,031
Then you got dumped, right?

697
00:27:37,114 --> 00:27:38,741
No, Edie.

698
00:27:38,824 --> 00:27:40,326
I wasn't dumped.

699
00:27:40,409 --> 00:27:42,370
Fired, whatever you want
to call it.

700
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:44,789
It was just a fun vacation thing
I did one year.

701
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:47,166
That's all.
I'm not an actress.

702
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:49,877
Oh, you don't have to tell me.
I was there.

703
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:51,879
It's really good
to see you, Edie.

704
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:53,547
- Hello. Love that hat.
- Oh, hi!

705
00:27:53,631 --> 00:27:55,508
That Kitty Carlisle Hart,
she's like Houdini!

706
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:57,551
I cornered her in a stall
in the bathroom.

707
00:27:57,635 --> 00:28:00,012
But when I kicked the door open,
she wasn't there.

708
00:28:00,096 --> 00:28:02,223
But I got her shoe.
Everyone look for a limper.

709
00:28:02,306 --> 00:28:03,933
Abe, he's free.

710
00:28:04,016 --> 00:28:05,810
Oh, let's grab him while we can.

711
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:07,353
There he is.

712
00:28:07,436 --> 00:28:10,064
Buzz, dear,
we are so proud of you.

713
00:28:10,147 --> 00:28:13,442
Oh! I loved everything about it.

714
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:15,569
Oh, but that one character,
Iris.

715
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:18,364
I mean, I hated her,
but I loved her, too.

716
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:20,366
Oh, thank you, Mrs. Weissman.

717
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:22,284
Uh, Abe, you didn't bring
your press hat.

718
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:24,120
It clashed with my cape.

719
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:26,330
Fun, right?

720
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:28,165
It's amazing.

721
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:30,584
I knew you
when you were a pisher.

722

into the lake on day one,

723
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:35,256

724
00:28:35,339 --> 00:28:37,091
I like making a big entrance.

725
00:28:37,174 --> 00:28:39,552
Are you happy, Buzz? Be happy.

726
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:43,097
I am.
It's the best night of my life.

since the curtain came up.

for guiding the ship
and teaching me so much.

And to our director,
Mr. George Abbott,

744

in this business, sir.

words short.

would like the show,

- One song?
- That they reprise

because they know

Oh, and I'm really sorry
about this lady.

that unique combination

1040

are you doing here?

Oh, well,
I hate to steal your line,

1043
00:42:05,649 --> 00:42:07,043
but what the hell
are you doing here?

1044
00:42:07,067 --> 00:42:08,818
You have to leave.
I'm about to go on.

1045
00:42:08,902 --> 00:42:11,112
Oh, shit. Are you stripping now?

1046
00:42:11,196 --> 00:42:12,989
I knew the Shy Baldwin thing
was tough,

1047
00:42:13,073 --> 00:42:15,158
- but there's nicer places.
- I'm the comic.

- Here?
- Yes. And I'm about to go on.

1049

And I'm still honing

- You want me to go away?
- Yes.

1051

I would make you nervous.

1052
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:25,919
You would make me nervous.

1053
00:42:26,002 --> 00:42:27,712
Don't smile. Bad smile.

1054
00:42:27,796 --> 00:42:30,173
I got a story for you.
Back in high school...

1055
00:42:30,257 --> 00:42:32,592
Mepham High in Bellmore,
out on Long Island...

1056
00:42:32,676 --> 00:42:34,261
I took this speech class.

1057
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:36,221
One day,
the teacher stands me up

1058
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:38,139
in front of everybody
and gives me a topic.

1059
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:40,433
Zoos. Are they good or bad?
Some shit like that.

1060
00:42:40,517 --> 00:42:42,018
I was supposed to be
against them.

1061
00:42:42,102 --> 00:42:45,230
Told me to take five full
minutes to make my case. Now,

1062
00:42:45,313 --> 00:42:47,524
I'm feeling fairly confident
about the subject,

1063
00:42:47,607 --> 00:42:49,067
so I start my little spiel,

1064
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,444
going on about how animals
shouldn't be in cages

1065
00:42:51,528 --> 00:42:52,728
and how we're the real animals

1066
00:42:52,779 --> 00:42:54,131
for putting them there
in the first place...

1067
00:42:54,155 --> 00:42:55,424
- Mm-hmm.
- ...when all of a sudden,

1068
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:57,575
I get beaned in the head
by an eraser.

1069
00:42:57,659 --> 00:43:01,121
I check to see who threw it,
and it was the fucking teacher.

1070
00:43:01,204 --> 00:43:02,956
Now, I'm surprised,
to say the least,

1071
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:05,458
but I continue my little speech
with a masterful segue

1072
00:43:05,542 --> 00:43:08,295
into the science of evolution
and how we're no less animal

1073
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:09,647
than any other
of God's creatures...

1074
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:11,506
That is, if God exists;
I threw that in...

1075
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,759
When another fucking eraser
hits me in the fucking head.

1076
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:16,594
And it's like that
every ten seconds

1077
00:43:16,678 --> 00:43:17,971
for the rest of my speech.

1078
00:43:18,054 --> 00:43:20,307
Something coming at my head.
Erasers, chalk,

1079
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:21,975
crumpled paper,
a half-eaten apple.

1080
00:43:22,058 --> 00:43:24,311
But I soldier on and get through
the five minutes.

1081
00:43:24,394 --> 00:43:27,439
Afterwards, I ask my teacher,
"What was that all about?"

1082
00:43:27,522 --> 00:43:29,441
And she says, "Mr. Schneider."

1083
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:31,151
For I was Schneider at the time.

1084
00:43:31,234 --> 00:43:33,486
"Mr. Schneider,
I was simply training you

1085
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:34,696
to block out distractions.

1086
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:36,489
It's your job to stay focused

1087
00:43:36,573 --> 00:43:38,950
despite whatever's coming
at you, and you did good."

1088
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:40,618
This seemed like bullshit
at the time,

1089
00:43:40,702 --> 00:43:43,288
but it turned out to be
a very valuable lesson.

1090
00:43:43,371 --> 00:43:45,290
It trained me for what I do now.

1091
00:43:45,373 --> 00:43:48,168
So, tonight, Mrs. Maisel,

1092
00:43:48,251 --> 00:43:51,713
your version of erasers
and chalk and half-eaten apples

1093
00:43:51,796 --> 00:43:53,882
will be me staying for your gig.

1094
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,759

to start the show.

where I can see you.

at a joint like this.

00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:08,037
God made those segments
for a reason.

1351
00:54:08,120 --> 00:54:10,581
- Hello?
- ASHER: Abe. It's Asher.

1352
00:54:10,665 --> 00:54:13,125
Asher. This is a surprise.

1353
00:54:13,209 --> 00:54:16,504
Really? I'm a little surprised
that you're surprised.

1354
00:54:16,587 --> 00:54:18,798
- Why?
- (CHUCKLES) Well,

1355
00:54:18,881 --> 00:54:21,634
a friend sent me
this thing you wrote

1356
00:54:21,717 --> 00:54:23,386
in the, uh, Village Voice.

1357
00:54:23,469 --> 00:54:27,223
You review a show.
They Came, They Danced.

1358
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:29,767
- Sounds like a piece of shit.
- That's putting it mildly.

1359
00:54:29,850 --> 00:54:33,145
And then you got
a little nostalgic at the end

1360
00:54:33,229 --> 00:54:34,939
with the asterisk
and the American dream,

1361
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:37,316
which segued very nicely

1362
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,695
into something the two of us did
back in the '20s.

1363
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:42,446
My editor likes me
to get personal.

1364
00:54:42,530 --> 00:54:43,948
Oh, sure.

1365
00:54:44,031 --> 00:54:47,660
But did he like the fact
that you fingered the two of us

1366
00:54:47,743 --> 00:54:50,413
for a federal fucking crime,
Abe?!

1367
00:54:50,496 --> 00:54:53,165
- What are you talking about?
- The nifty little paragraph

1368
00:54:53,249 --> 00:54:55,001
about art and anarchy

1369
00:54:55,084 --> 00:54:57,253
where you describe very vividly

1370
00:54:57,336 --> 00:55:00,881
how you and I
set a federal building on fire.

1371
00:55:00,965 --> 00:55:03,634
Oh, that was years ago.
No one cares.

1372
00:55:03,718 --> 00:55:06,012
- The FBI does.
- What?

1373
00:55:06,095 --> 00:55:08,889
They want to see us in the
New York field office next week.

1374
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:10,891
The FBI hasn't contacted me.

1375
00:55:10,975 --> 00:55:12,727
They will. Trust me.

1376
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:14,437
So kiss your loved ones goodbye

1377
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:16,920
and grab your toothbrush, Abe,
because you and I are gonna be

1378
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:18,858
breaking rocks at Leavenworth.

1379
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:20,359
Which is gonna be hell
on my gout.

1380
00:55:20,443 --> 00:55:21,736
- See you in New York.
- Asher...

(PLAYING "GOODNIGHT
SWEETHEART GOODNIGHT")

1384
00:56:10,076 --> 00:56:12,161
To Jackie.

1385
00:56:12,244 --> 00:56:14,914
A man who didn't
suffer fools gladly

1386
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:17,750
and thought everyone was a fool.

1387
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:20,544
A man whose love of ocarinas
summed up his total

1388
00:56:20,628 --> 00:56:22,129
lack of musical taste.

1389
00:56:22,213 --> 00:56:24,924
A man who borrowed ten bucks
from me the day before he died,

1390
00:56:25,007 --> 00:56:27,510
because somehow he knew.

1391
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:32,181
A man who knew how to drive me
crazier than any person

1392
00:56:32,264 --> 00:56:34,266
in this fucking world,
except you.

1393
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,938
A man who was... my friend.

1394
00:56:40,397 --> 00:56:42,525
- To Jackie.
- To Jackie.
