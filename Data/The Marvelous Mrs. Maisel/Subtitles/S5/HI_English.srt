1
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,110
(audience laughing)

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:09,876
(Gordon) So, I had to
bump a guest last night

3
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,246
who was supposed to be on the
show when we ran out of time,

4
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:12,910
and it's not
without its dangers.

5
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,336
One night,
I bumped Jackie Gleason.

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,876
Next day, he bumped me
straight to the moon.

7
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,410
Yeah.

8
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:19,430
I was black and blue for a week.

9
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:24,210
Winter weather's taking hold
all over America.

10
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:26,370
Right now, the roads are wetter
than Richard Nixon

11
00:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,380
during a televised debate.

12
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,766
- Slippery, very slippery.
- And the winner for the least interesting joke goes to...

13
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,390
- Hmm?
- Huh? - (Gordon) Hey, will someone

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,010
please tell the Shirelles
that, yes,

15
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,600
I will still love them tomorrow?

16
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,800
The band's waiting half a beat
when I throw to them

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,810
after the monologue.
They got to jump in quicker

18
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,190
so I'm not hanging out there.

19
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,196
Exactly, I keep saying
they got to jump in quicker.

20
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,240
- I'll talk to Tony.
- (mouthing)

21
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,036
And is Teddy's writing
getting smaller, or are my eyes

22
00:00:49,060 --> 00:00:50,576
- getting worse? - (George)
His writing's getting smaller.

23
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:52,370
Much smaller.
I noticed that, too.

24
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,870
- I'll talk to Teddy.
- (mouthing) - (Gordon) So, now,

25
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:57,126
the Kerouac joke... why didn't
that get a bigger laugh?

26
00:00:57,150 --> 00:00:59,030
Felt like a lot of people
didn't know who he is.

27
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,796
The guy's a best-selling
author, what gives?

28
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:03,170
- I know who he is.
- (Gordon) We got to stop

29
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:04,926
with the outdated references.
Keep it fresh.

30
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,070
(George) Well, said, Gordie.

31
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,160
See you at Toots?

32
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:08,436
I've got to get home
to the missus.

33
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,510
She's under the weather.

34
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,266
She was fine when I left her
this afternoon.

35
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,840
- Clever.
- Hey, tally's wrong.

36
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:14,360
Gordon dropped
the orphanage joke.

37
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,560
Oh, sorry, Cess.

38
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,270
Well, still more jokes than you.

39
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:18,730
(Ralph) This isn't a contest.

40
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,946
(Cecil) Of course
it's a contest.

41
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:20,970
You know what that means.

42
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:22,270
(Cecil) Maisel's 0 for 30.

43
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,156
- (Mel) Broke the record.
- (Cecil) Yup. (laughs)

44
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,440
(Ralph) Thanks again, Midge.

45
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,020
Didn't get a joke in again, huh?

46
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,820
No, but I do know
who Jack Kerouac is.

47
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:32,050
Who?

48
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,950
Oh!

49
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:40,150
(sighs)

50
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:42,220
(♪ Ofra Haza: "Tzur Menati")

51
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,600
(indistinct chatter)

52
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,450
Beautiful yield today.

53
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:59,990
God looked down and smiled.

54
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,960
(exclaiming)

55
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,810
Ethan.

56
00:02:26,350 --> 00:02:29,300
Oh, Ethan, let me look at you.

57
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:31,800
Mama, you know
there's an airport here.

58
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,640
Oh, it's practically
in Egypt it's so far.

59
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,900
(woman) Ethan.

60
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:37,600
It's okay! It's just my mother!

61
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:39,410
She's visiting from New York.

62
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,640
- (others) Oh.
- They act like they've never seen a Jewish mother before.

63
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,390
Well, it's Israel, Mama.

64
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,190
Helicopters suddenly appearing
in the sky

65
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,360
make people very nervous.

66
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,110
Who's gonna invade
a lettuce farm...

67
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:51,920
Health-conscious anti-Semites
who want a salad?

68
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:56,950
Does he just wait for you?

69
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:58,800
He's fine. He's got a book.

70
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:01,880
<i>(Ethan) And when the parsnips</i>

71
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,960
started peeking out,
we were all stunned.

72
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:05,796
I mean, you think
you're planting horseradish,

73
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,540
and then up come parsnips.

74
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,040
God works in mysterious ways.

75
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,380
Well, actually, we just got
the packets mixed up.

76
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,760
Oh, good, you haven't
changed completely.

77
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,680
So...

78
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,140
how are your studies going?
Are you a rabbi yet?

79
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:20,560
Oh, no, not yet.

80
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:22,316
You've been at rabbi school
for years now.

81
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:23,600
It's not called rabbi school.

82
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,156
I mean, you didn't want
to go to college,

83
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,986
fine, but should it take longer
to become a rabbi

84
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:28,290
than it does to become a lawyer?

85
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:29,610
Yes.

86
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:33,030
Yes. I... I got my answer.

87
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,240
So, for tonight,
I'm sending a car

88
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,740
to pick you up at 6:30 sharp.

89
00:03:36,940 --> 00:03:38,990
- You got the suit I sent?
- I did, but...

90
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,746
Ethan, do not give me
a hard time about this.

91
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:42,620
It's not every night
the UJA-Federation

92
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,660
honors your mother, and I need
my son to look handsome.

93
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,870
Make sure you shave and bathe.

94
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,920
Twice, because some of this
seems permanent.

95
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,590
- I work in the fields. There's dignity in labor.
- Your labor,

96
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,590
- maybe. Mine involves a roomful
of people staring at my - Mama.

97
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,140
Cabbage patch. See?
I kept it thematic for you.

98
00:03:59,330 --> 00:04:01,220
I don't understand
why you say such things.

99
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:03,060
Well, good thing
you don't book the Copa.

100
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:05,140
- Oh, I have a little news.
- Hm?

101
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,280
Chava. Chava.

102
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,650
Mama, I'd like you to meet...

103
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,690
Let me guess... Chava?

104
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:14,040
We're getting married.

105
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:16,820
This is a "little news"?

106
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,570
It's nice to meet you,
Mrs. Maisel.

107
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,336
I'm sorry, did you say
you're getting married?

108
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,990
Yes, after harvest.

109
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:24,006
- No clue when that is.
- (Chava) I understand marriage

110
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,490
is not a happy topic for you.

111
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:26,970
Ethan told me
about your divorce.

112
00:04:27,070 --> 00:04:28,790
Oh, yeah? Which one?

113
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:31,750
Not to have felt pain is not to
have been human.

114
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:35,380
Well, that was beautiful,
I assume.

115
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,880
So, Chava,

116
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:40,800
- are your parents kibbutz-ers, too?
- (Chava) No.

117
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,010
I was born in Tel Aviv
but we moved to Minnesota

118
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:45,450
when my father became head
of surgery at the Mayo Clinic.

119
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,970
I moved back to join the army.

120
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:49,650
I didn't see much combat, but I
did break my leg in four places

121
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,100
when my parachute opened late.

122
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,690
I was separated from my platoon,
so I had to set it myself

123
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:56,400
and climb a date tree
to sleep in.

124
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,820
I still get teased about that.

125
00:04:58,020 --> 00:04:59,570
Yeah, you'll never
live that down.

126
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,910
Okay, I have to go.

127
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:04,130
Ethan, walk Mommy
to her helicopter?

128
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:07,410
Be faithful to that one

129
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,120
or she'll rip your nuts off and
plant them next to the onions.

130
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,040
I will be completely faithful
to her, always.

131
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,130
Okay.
I'll see you at 6:30 sharp.

132
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:19,170
Wear the suit.

133
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:21,320
(helicopter blades whirring)

134
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,610
Wish you'd told me
you had a fianc e.

135
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,370
Sorry.

136
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,570
I don't like her.

137
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,260
Well, she's my mother.

138
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,630
<i>- (tape rips)
- (Midge) There.</i>

139
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:48,290
This is ridiculous.

140
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:50,200
He's a little boy.
You tell a little boy

141
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,836
what to do, you don't
trick him into doing it.

142
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,420
This is what the school
therapist told us to do, okay?

143
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,290
There. We make it a game.

144
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,426
Every night, he sleeps
two feet closer to his room

145
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:00,460
until finally
he makes it to his bed.

146
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,090
He wins. There.

147
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:04,640
We should put him
in a new school.

148
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,936
Any school we put him in is
gonna think we're bad parents.

149
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,100
- Why?
- We're divorced. I'm a comic.

150
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,930
I've been to jail.
You own a nightclub.

151
00:06:11,130 --> 00:06:13,116
Ah, but we make our son sleep
on the floor of the hallway

152
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,580
and suddenly
we're Ozzie and Harriet?

153
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,640
You have a better idea?

154
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,190
Tell him to sleep
in his own bed.

155
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,900
Wow, I did not think of that.
No wonder men run the world.

156
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,590
There.

157
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:25,070
Probably should've let Ethan
talk to him.

158
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:27,370
To the school therapist?
No fucking way.

159
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:29,990
I don't want some quack
messing with my son's mind.

160
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,586
Five minutes,
he'll have Ethan convinced

161
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:33,530
- his whole family's insane.
- Did you hear that?

162
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:34,610
What, Mama?

163
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,170
I just...

164
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:38,520
Nothing. Who wants tea?

165
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,010
It's weak to go to a therapist.

166
00:06:42,210 --> 00:06:44,840
Yes, your opinion has been
stated, loud and clear.

167
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,160
And don't you dare talk about
any of this in your act.

168
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:49,450
Why are you so cranky? There.

169
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,100
Is it Moishe and Shirley?

170
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,600
You mean the unstoppable force
and the immovable object?

171
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,440
- Oh.
- They're driving me crazy.

172
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,196
They insist on staying
in that house together

173
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,286
but they won't speak
to each other,

174
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,510
so everything goes through me.

175
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,920
I spent the morning negotiating

176
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,866
what the temperature should be
when they sleep.

177
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,360
65 or 66.

178
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,166
An hour and a half
on a one-degree difference.

179
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:08,626
- (front door slams shut)
- Oh! There.

180
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:10,296
You heard that, right?
It was a thump or a bang.

181
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,440
- It was the front door, Rose.
- But who came through?

182
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:14,910
Oh, Abe. It's... you. Oh, Abe.

183
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,310
What are you doing down there?

184
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:18,750
Well, we met with
Ethan's school, and they...

185
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:22,150
Never mind.
I can't even pretend to care.

186
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,050
- (Midge) Papa.
- (Rose gasps)

187
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,050
(Midge) It's just me, Mama.

188
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,550
Anything wrong, Papa?

189
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,310
I spelled Carol Channing's
name wrong.

190
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:32,970
Oh. How did you spell it?

191
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:34,520
Wrong! Does it matter?

192
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,190
I did it and the paper
had to issue a correction.

193
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:39,360
A correction
for everyone to read.

194
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,570
Does anyone
really read corrections?

195
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,770
Of course they do.

196
00:07:42,850 --> 00:07:45,440
I start every paper
reading the corrections.

197
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,660
That's how you know
who the idiots are.

198
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:50,780
And up until now,
I was the only person

199
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:54,540
at the <i>Voice</i> that had never
been corrected in print.

200
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:56,580
Now I, too, am an idiot.

201
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,210
Well, maybe now they'll let you
sit at their table at lunch.

202
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:00,840
Look at it.

203
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,340
"On Monday,
Carol Channing..." two N's,

204
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,880
"was incorrectly spelled
as 'Chaning, '" one N. Ugh.

205
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,680
I've been branded.
I'm-I'm Hester Prynne.

206
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,140
Two N's in Prynne, by the way.

207
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:13,350
I just can't remember
the last time

208
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,630
I made a mistake like this.

209
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,060
Look, now, come on.

210
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,230
(Abe) Not in 25 years
at Columbia,

211
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:20,810
not in high school,
elementary school.

212
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,110
I may have gotten something
wrong in kindergarten,

213
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:26,740
but there are no existing
records of my time there.

214
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,200
I checked.

215
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,740
You're divorced.
What are you doing here?

216
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,490
Ethan's school therapist
told us...

217
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:34,870
- I told you, I don't care!
- (Rose gasps)

218
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,660
You had to hear it that time.

219
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:39,620
It was a gun being cocked
or a sword being unsheathed.

220
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,790
I just dropped the paper
down on the table.

221
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:46,300
You... Are you trying
to drive me mad, Abe Weissman?

222
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,400
Yeah. There's no way
I'm keeping this out of my act.

223
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,970
<i>(Mel) "I mean, the kid</i>

224
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,760
had to take kindergarten
a second time.

225
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,140
He failed finger paints."

226
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:56,606
Something other than
finger paints.

227
00:08:56,630 --> 00:08:57,870
- "He failed sharing."
- Better.

228
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,640
- "He failed snack."
- Bit of a thinker.

229
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,406
We give 'em one a night.
Go with snack, guys.

230
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:02,790
How do you spell
"discombobulated"?

231
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,946
Teddy, that was two jokes ago.
You're two jokes behind?

232
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:06,250
I have a mind like a steel trap.

233
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,710
And a butt like
a bowl of spaghetti.

234
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:09,866
- Look who's talking.
- Guys, stop. We need one more,

235
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:12,280
so focus.
We need something, anything.

236
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,280
Well...

237
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:15,200
Never mind.

238
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,256
- You got something? Let's hear it.
- Your every thought

239
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,046
- is the property of <i>The Gordon Ford Show.</i>
- So don't fight it.

240
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,170
Okay. Well...

241
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,500
(sighs) "Mel Blanc,
the voice of Bugs Bunny,

242
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:26,130
was recently in a car accident.

243
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:27,970
He's recovering nicely,
though authorities

244
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,090
are still questioning
the voice of Elmer Fudd."

245
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:31,050
(chuckles)

246
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,250
- I like it.
- Me too.

247
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,686
Gordon'll like it, too.
Put it in.

248
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:35,260
Wait, put it in?

249
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,010
Uh, when you say
"put it in," you mean

250
00:09:37,210 --> 00:09:38,350
"put it in"? Shut up, Mel.

251
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:40,730
(Alvin) Yeah. It was good,
it's going in.

252
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:42,480
Wow. Wow.

253
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,400
Just has to get past
the man upstairs.

254
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,360
- (Trudy) Here he comes.
- Whew.

255
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,156
Smells like an elephant's
ass crack in here.

256
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,300
- Trudy, you ready?
- Got it.

257
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,630
Gimme.

258
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,530
Okay.

259
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:59,336
- (writers exhale)
- (Alvin) Nice work, guys.

260
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,840
(Cecil) Ooh,
another squeaker, though.

261
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,386
(Mel) Humbly speaking,
we're the best in the business.

262
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,966
(Alvin) Let's take a break.
We've earned it.

263
00:10:03,990 --> 00:10:05,346
(Teddy) Oh, good, my mother's
called me three times.

264
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,170
<i>(Susie) You sing?</i>

265
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:07,380
<i>(Tessie) You know I sing.</i>

266
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,766
When did I ever hear you sing?

267
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,300
In all the school plays.

268
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,781
Don't you remember me doing
<i>The Band Wagon</i> in high school?

269
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,806
I remember you doing the band
back in high school,

270
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,050
but not you singing.

271
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,646
<i>You always diminish my dreams,
you know that?</i>

272
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:19,220
You're very consistent
in that way.

273
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,230
One of the reasons
I'm in this terrible rut

274
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,140
is because I get no help
from you or anyone.

275
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,400
I will try to find you
something, Tess, I promise.

276
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:27,150
Don't break this promise.

277
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,570
Since Skint died,
I'm feeling very vulnerable.

278
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:31,320
- Wait, Skint died?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

279
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:32,900
Your husband? My brother-in-law?

280
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,900
<i>Yeah, last week.</i>

281
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,380
And you didn't think to tell me?

282
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:37,830
It was natural causes,
so there was nothing to tell.

283
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,370
I'll call you later, Tess.

284
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,370
(Nicky) Susie, chime in here,

285
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,040
is this floral print too busy?

286
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,750
Eh, the decor's
Dinah's call, Nicky.

287
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,596
- She's the one who gives a shit.
- (phone rings)

288
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,080
Thank you.

289
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,440
Susie Myerson and Associates.

290
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,380
Oh, hi, Midge. She's right here.

291
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,920
(door shuts)

292
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,120
Hey, what's up?

293
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:54,800
- I got a joke in.
- <i>(Susie) Finally.</i>

294
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,840
It took me four weeks
to get the hang of it.

295
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,316
No, it took them four weeks
to realize their fucking cocks

296
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:01,100
wouldn't fall off
if they put a lady joke in.

297
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,446
- <i>Be sure to watch tonight.</i>
- (door opens)

298
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:03,890
- <i>Dinah, too.</i>
- I'll, uh...

299
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,440
- handle this.
- (door closes)

300
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:07,446
Miriam, I got to go right now.
Your mother just walked in.

301
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:09,150
Ha, ha, very funny. Goodbye.

302
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,980
Bye.

303
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,230
Rose.

304
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:14,450
I tried to call,
but I couldn't get through.

305
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,160
Well, my business
is really picking up.

306
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:17,950
It's a busy
professional office now.

307
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,950
(Frank) Fuck me? Fuck you

308
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,080
and the donkey you rode in on

309
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,620
and fuck
the donkey's sister, too.

310
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,620
Come on in.

311
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:28,580
Sit down.

312
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:31,050
So, uh... what's up?

313
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:33,670
Susie, you're the angriest
person I know.

314
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,050
- All right.
- (Rose) And you associate

315
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:38,340
with angry people.
There's always a frightening,

316
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,930
terrible energy coming from you.

317
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,410
Where you going with this, Rose?

318
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:43,236
Well, I was wondering if
you could help me get a gun.

319
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,810
- What?
- Nothing fancy, and not too heavy.

320
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:48,440
It has to fit in my purse
and be quick on the draw.

321
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,906
You a righty or a lefty,
sweetheart?

322
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:51,270
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. Rose,

323
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,790
why on earth
would you need a gun?

324
00:11:52,890 --> 00:11:55,900
I stepped on some toes
with my matchmaking business.

325
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,950
Encroached on the turf
of some not very nice people.

326
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:01,370
So, you're gonna shoot them?
These old women with a gun.

327
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:03,410
Oh, no, not shoot.
Just brandish.

328
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:04,910
Wave it around a little.

329
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,790
Pistol whipping can be
very effective, too,

330
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,110
and it's a shorter sentence.

331
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,240
Really? Don't speak.

332
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:12,170
They've threatened me
and my family.

333
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,766
- Come on.
- (Rose) They cornered Abe

334
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:16,590
at his tobacco shop. Said
terrible things about the Torah.

335
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,930
We've had flights canceled,
mail stolen,

336
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:21,430
- dry cleaning ruined.
- Who hasn't?

337
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,396
And I'm fairly certain
they burned the tea room down.

338
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,060
Wait, they burned down
the tea room?

339
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,390
- My tea room?
- (Rose) Yes.

340
00:12:26,590 --> 00:12:28,106
(Susie) With the delicious
whipped cream?

341
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,656
That has just the right
amount of vanilla

342
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:31,980
and a hint of nutmeg that
makes it downright celestial?

343
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,180
It burned to the ground.

344
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,320
I was gonna invest.

345
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:37,240
- (Rose) It's gone.
- Holy shit.

346
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,990
- (Frank) I'll kill you, you hear?
- (loud thud)

347
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,990
Oh.

348
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:44,410
I'm... I'm, uh,
sorry for any language

349
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,040
you may have heard in there.

350
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,040
Uh, call got pretty contentious.

351
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,240
Everything okay, partner?

352
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,546
It's the ticket office
to <i>Camelot.</i>

353
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,330
Wife wants tickets,
and these theater people,

354
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,460
they don't respond to threats.

355
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,340
Look, please don't go shooting
up any ladies' luncheons.

356
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,010
In the meantime,
you need a place

357
00:12:59,210 --> 00:13:00,290
to do business for a while,

358
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,510
with the tea room gone?

359
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:03,550
For a couple days, perhaps.
I just need a table

360
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:04,890
and a phone.

361
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,390
- Hey, Maggie!
- Yeah?

362
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,890
I'm sending Midge's mom over.
Find a space for her.

363
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,020
- What?
- Just open the fucking door.

364
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,820
Go down the hall
and take a right.

365
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:16,010
Thank you, Susie.

366
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,230
How beautiful.

367
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,070
- Damask?
- Mm-hmm. Told you.

368
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,990
- I'm in the minority.
- (Susie) Bullies.

369
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,530
Man, do I hate bullies.

370
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,580
Screwing with a nice,
crazy lady like Rose.

371
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:27,080
- You can't let her get a gun.
- No, of course not.

372
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,460
So, uh, how about... (mumbles)

373
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:32,540
- Them? No, no, no, no, no.
- Why not?

374
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,710
- (mumbles) - No, I don't want to...
(mumbles)

375
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:40,010
You guys do know that we speak
"mumble" pretty fluently, right?

376
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,370
You want us to get into this?

377
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,460
- No.
- Maybe.

378
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,180
- (Frank) You sure?
- Hey, Susie!

379
00:13:44,380 --> 00:13:46,760
Who's this uptown broad making
me rearrange my furniture?

380
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,680
Just let her hang there a while.

381
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:52,230
Mm, this is perfect, Susie.
Thank you. Uh, no.

382
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,616
I think facing
the door is better.

383
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,640
She's Midge's mom, right?

384
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:55,920
There's nothing for you guys

385
00:13:56,060 --> 00:13:57,360
to do on this. Thanks.

386
00:13:57,560 --> 00:13:58,610
- Okay.
- All right.

387
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:00,090
(Nicky) I wish you'd come to me.

388
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:01,916
- I could get you tickets.
- (Frank) Oh, yeah?

389
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,586
- (Nicky) I know Robert Goulet.
- (Frank) That's right.

390
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,450
(Nicky) Yeah, we golf
on Saturdays.

391
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,126
- (audience laughing)
- Have a great time.

392
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:08,740
Make a lot of noise
and show Gordon

393
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,370
and all the folks back home
that you're having a great time.

394
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:13,770
- Enjoy the show, everyone.
- (applause)

395
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,920
Hey, Teddy, can you save me
the card with my joke on it?

396
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,470
It's my first to get on.

397
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,930
Gladly. That's exciting.

398
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,840
- It is.
- (chuckles)

399
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,680
(band playing fanfare)

400
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,310
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's <i>The Gordon Ford Show.</i>

401
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,980
- (applause)
- Tonight's guests: Pat Boone.

402
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,270
From <i>Dobie Gillis,</i> Bob Denver.

403
00:14:35,470 --> 00:14:37,940
And comedian Lester Simms.

404
00:14:38,140 --> 00:14:39,980
Now, here's your host,

405
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:42,530
Gordon Ford!

406
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:44,670
- (audience cheering)
- (applause)

407
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,700
- (music ends)
- (chuckles)

408
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,160
So, President John F. Kennedy.

409
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:54,046
I have to say, it's gonna be
strange having a Catholic

410
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,460
president from Massachusetts.

411
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:57,386
I just worry when it comes
to important matters,

412
00:14:57,410 --> 00:14:59,096
his allegiance will always be
to the Red Sox.

413
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,510
- (laughter)
- (Gordon) Yeah.

414
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,920
Oh, this was in the news,
in preparation

415
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,856
for a potential showdown
with Cuban guerrillas,

416
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:08,890
the U.S. military recently
purchased a B-52 bomber

417
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,720
and 10,000 bananas.

418
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,930
(Gordon) Sprinkle those out.

419
00:15:14,130 --> 00:15:15,940
Mel Blanc,
the voice of Bugs Bunny,

420
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:17,196
was recently in a car accident.

421
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,810
He's recovering nicely, though,

422
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,116
authorities
are still questioning

423
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,280
the voice of Fell-mer...

424
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,150
(groans loudly)

425
00:15:23,350 --> 00:15:25,130
(audience murmuring)

426
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,740
That's a new character,
folks: Fell-mer.

427
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:33,010
- (laughter) - Sidekick to Forky Pig.
He's hysterical.

428
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,370
Speaking of cartoons,

429
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,960
Disney recently released
<i>101 Dalmatians.</i>

430
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:40,800
A lot of people
are complimenting the art,

431
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,550
but, personally,
I found it a bit spotty.

432
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:45,970
- (laughter) - (Gordon)
It's just me, I guess.

433
00:15:46,170 --> 00:15:48,110
(indistinct conversation)

434
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,350
Hey, Midge, uh,
here's your card.

435
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:59,230
- Thanks, Teddy.
- You gonna frame it?

436
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,820
- Or burn it for heat.
- Okay.

437
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,900
- Was it as loud as it seemed?
- Louder.

438
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,030
- You...
- Yes?

439
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:07,900
Have nothing to worry about.

440
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,910
Just flash that hundred-watt
smile at Gordie

441
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,740
and it'll all blow over.
Piece of cake.

442
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,450
- You think?
- I know.

443
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,370
- Thanks.
- If you want to keep your job,

444
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,540
- grovel.
- But George just said...

445
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,880
George is wrong about
everything, in the world.

446
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,380
I am telling you, grovel.

447
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:24,730
Grovel like you have never
groveled before.

448
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:30,470
Someone will be here at 1:00
to accept the delivery.

449
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:32,390
Nope, not before 1:00.

450
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:34,430
Because we're a nightclub,
not a preschool.

451
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,730
(knock on door)

452
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,060
Yeah. We'll see you at 1:00.
What you need?

453
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,360
Remember when we
opened the club,

454
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,730
how we discussed exactly
what we wanted it to be?

455
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,940
- Yes.
- Good music, hip clientele?

456
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,910
- Yes, I remember.
- Especially the hip clientele.

457
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,280
We felt very strongly that
a certain element would, say,

458
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:55,950
dampen the festive atmosphere
of the place?

459
00:16:56,150 --> 00:16:58,790
- Shit, the Mormons came back?
- Oh, I wish.

460
00:16:58,990 --> 00:17:00,216
(Shirley) Some people say
you don't

461
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,880
salt your veal
till the very end,

462
00:17:02,070 --> 00:17:04,210
but what are they waiting for?
The roof could cave in.

463
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:05,630
Outer-space men could land

464
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:07,630
in your backyard,
zap you right in the tuchus,

465
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:09,840
then you're dead
with unsalted veal.

466
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:11,040
- Ma.
- Yeah?

467
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,890
- What are you doing here?
- Mm. Joely,

468
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:15,810
I'm having the best time
with my new friends,

469
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:18,100
"What's His Name"
and "What's Her Name."

470
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,560
They're from somewhere,

471
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:21,980
and they came here
to celebrate something.

472
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:23,180
- Archie.
- Yep.

473
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,220
Can I take that?

474
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,070
Uh-uh! If you try,

475
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,570
I'm gonna put you over my knee

476
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:28,780
and spank you.
When he was a boy,

477
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:31,150
he was so afraid of my hairbrush

478
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:32,950
that he would hide in my closet,

479
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:35,240
put on my wig and just lie there

480
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,950
- like I wouldn't notice.
- (laughter)

481
00:17:38,150 --> 00:17:41,620
Hello, there. You look like
you're about to throw up.

482
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:44,000
Have a cracker sandwich.

483
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:46,250
Who else is hungry?

484
00:17:46,450 --> 00:17:48,880
You really should sell
some snacks here, Joel.

485
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,380
But then, of course,

486
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:54,010
you'd have to turn up the lights
so they could see the menu.

487
00:17:54,210 --> 00:17:57,640
It's so dark in here.
I can't see myself think.

488
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,770
Ma, how long have these
been in your purse?

489
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:02,730
Oh, God!

490
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:05,060
- Here you go, Mrs. Maisel.
- I didn't ask for that.

491
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,820
I just thought something warm...

492
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,366
You know, I've had
about enough of men

493
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,860
telling me what they think.

494
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,060
I'm sorry.

495
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:12,360
I think you should drink it.

496
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,560
That's what I think.

497
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,780
Hello, there.
I'm Shirley Maisel.

498
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,990
That's my son, Joel, the owner.

499
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,080
Won't be seeing
much of him soon because

500
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,080
he's about to have a baby.

501
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,460
He's gonna be at home
cleaning up the poo-poo.

502
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:28,250
- Ma! - (Shirley) There he
goes again with the "Ma."

503
00:18:28,450 --> 00:18:30,260
Go home.

504
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,596
I can't stay
in that house anymore.

505
00:18:31,620 --> 00:18:33,840
Ma, please, you guys
have to figure this out.

506
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,760
He's not gonna retire, Joel.

507
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:37,350
Of course he's not gonna retire.

508
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:38,850
He was never gonna retire.

509
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:42,100
He will die at work yelling
at his yarn guy. Accept it.

510
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,190
Well, his yarn guy
is a real schmuck.

511
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:47,270
I'll get you a cab.

512
00:18:47,470 --> 00:18:51,030
- How come she gets to stay?
- She works here.

513
00:18:51,230 --> 00:18:53,150
- Why?
- Why, what?

514
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:55,700
Why do you work for my son?
It's weird.

515
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,780
Do you two have some sort of
weird sicko thing going on?

516
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,790
Mr. Maisel, I certainly hope
your mother can take a punch.

517
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:04,370
- Oh, she can.
- Hey, hey, no! Stay...

518
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,130
She won't leave. She's had...
I don't know how many drinks.

519
00:19:07,330 --> 00:19:09,210
- Oh, boy.
- S<i>he's got baggies of rotten food.</i>

520
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,766
She's passing them out
to everyone who looks drunk.

521
00:19:10,790 --> 00:19:11,960
So, everyone.

522
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,056
Yeah, that's a lethal purse
if you're not careful.

523
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,266
<i>She keeps trying
to turn on the lights.</i>

524
00:19:15,290 --> 00:19:16,810
She keeps asking
where we keep the mop.

525
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,186
She hates the music. She wants
everyone to put on a sweater.

526
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:21,010
Oh, she tried to fight
Mrs. Moskowitz.

527
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:22,610
That seems like
a pretty fair fight.

528
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,760
- <i>Pop.</i>
- Sorry.

529
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,810
I'm not gonna have a club
if this continues.

530
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,270
Please, help me with this.

531
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,650
- <i>Yep, I'm on it.</i>
- Thank you.

532
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,000
I found the mop. (chuckles)

533
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,390
Hm...

534
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:50,460
No, this is why
I'll never cover hockey...

535
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,960
Because it's a baseball town.

536
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,960
- Okay?
- Excuse me,

537
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,380
what's Mr. Ford drinking?

538
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,630
- Bourbon and branch.
- One of those, please.

539
00:19:57,830 --> 00:19:59,356
Heavy on the bourbon,
easy on the branch.

540
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:00,776
(Jimmy) The Pirates
are gonna repeat.

541
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,276
It's not what I want,
but it's what's gonna happen.

542
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,350
- No, it's gonna be the Yanks.
- Without Stengel?

543
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:06,480
Good riddance to Stengel.
Don't quote me on that.

544
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,060
Word is, he's talking
to the Mets.

545
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:09,810
The Mets? What's the Mets?

546
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,980
Gordon? Sorry to interrupt. Hi.

547
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:15,280
Hello, and you are interrupting.

548
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,200
Yes, but I come bearing gifts.

549
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:18,860
Bourbon and olive branch.

550
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:21,510
Already got one. Thanks.

551
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:23,800
This is awkward.

552
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,750
And getting more awkward.

553
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,710
I just wanted to say
I'm very sorry

554
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:28,910
for groaning like that.

555
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,420
It was totally unprofessional.

556
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,460
She groaned
during the show, audibly.

557
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:33,960
Stupidly. Involuntarily.

558
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:35,176
Oh, so someone forced you?

559
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,720
No, but there was a reason.

560
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:38,556
Were you going into labor?
That would be a good reason.

561
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,106
I don't know how you women
do it. Having babies...

562
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,970
No. See, it was just...

563
00:20:42,170 --> 00:20:43,730
It was the first joke
I got on the show,

564
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,120
and when what happened happened,

565
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:46,580
I let the emotion of it
get to me.

566
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:47,856
- That was your first joke?
- (Midge) Yes.

567
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,690
You've been there
a number of weeks.

568
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,440
It's a tough room.

569
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,196
- (Gordon) It's the best room in the business.
- Definitely.

570
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,446
Anyhow, when you
bobbled the line,

571
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:55,150
I was just really disappointed,
that's all.

572
00:20:55,180 --> 00:20:56,500
And whatever happens
from here on,

573
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,570
please accept my apology.

574
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:01,800
Fine. I accept your apology.

575
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:05,790
And I'm sorry I interrupted.

576
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:08,200
Leave the drink.
(scoffs) Bobbled it.

577
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,280
Joke was gonna bomb
whether I bobbled it or not.

578
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:12,250
- (laughs)
- Mm...

579
00:21:12,450 --> 00:21:13,590
No, it wasn't.

580
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,620
What do you mean,
"No, it wasn't"? Yes, it was.

581
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:17,940
No, the joke was good. You just
stumbled over Elmer Fudd.

582
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,346
I didn't stumble
over Elmer Fudd.

583
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,766
- (Midge) Uh, yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

584
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:22,016
Kind of want to hear this joke.

585
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,646
Gordon, I'm a comedian.
I know about rhythm.

586
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:24,830
You blew the joke. It's okay.

587
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,606
- I got the laugh.
- (Midge) By pointing out

588
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,566
- that you blew the joke.
- I did that on purpose.

589
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:30,670
You blew a perfectly good joke
so you could point out

590
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,776
to the audience that you
blew a perfectly good joke?

591
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:33,940
Yes. They love that.

592
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:35,486
It makes me human,
and I got a laugh.

593
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,830
Yeah, but you got
the wrong laugh.

594
00:21:36,970 --> 00:21:38,616
A laugh is a laugh.
There is no wrong laugh.

595
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,666
(Midge) It was a cover laugh.

596
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:41,010
It's a trick,
I've done it myself,

597
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,166
but if you had just
done the real joke

598
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,206
correctly, you would've gotten

599
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,950
a bigger laugh, the right laugh.

600
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,450
That joke was gonna bomb.
End of story.

601
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:50,000
- Then why'd you okay it?
- What?

602
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,006
You okay every joke.
Are you saying you okayed a joke

603
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,390
that you knew
was destined to bomb?

604
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:55,346
- Now, wait a minute...
- Or you saying you okayed it,

605
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:56,766
not knowing it was gonna bomb
till you got

606
00:21:56,790 --> 00:21:58,710
on stage and your special
bomb detector kicked in

607
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,226
and you suddenly knew
it was gonna bomb,

608
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,346
so you saved it by blowing it

609
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:02,180
and getting the wrong laugh?

610
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:03,800
There is no wrong laugh.

611
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,390
There's absolutely
a wrong laugh.

612
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:07,226
A wrong laugh is a laugh
you get by accident

613
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,566
because you fucked up
the right laugh.

614
00:22:08,590 --> 00:22:10,230
That is a wrong goddam laugh.

615
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:12,486
Now, look here, Miss "I finally
got one fucking joke in

616
00:22:12,510 --> 00:22:13,656
after six months on the job..."

617
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,866
So, you can't read
a calendar either?

618
00:22:14,890 --> 00:22:15,900
It's only been a month.

619
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:17,940
I have been doing this
a very long time.

620
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,900
I'm a professional
goddamn performer.

621
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,130
Who made a goddamn mistake
and won't admit it.

622
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:29,910
- That is a terrible drink.
- (murmuring)

623
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:32,760
There are no wrong laughs.

624
00:22:53,530 --> 00:22:55,600
<i>(Abe) I was writing</i>

625
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:57,270
deep into the night. That is,

626
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,690
when I wasn't consulting
Cicero for inspiration.

627
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:02,490
I hope it will undo
at least some of the damage.

628
00:23:02,690 --> 00:23:04,610
You misspelled "Channing," Abe.

629
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:07,010
Don't you think you're being
a bit too hard on yourself?

630
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:08,660
<i>Mm, not according to Cicero.</i>

631
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,370
Okay, here's the bottom line,

632
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:13,500
I cannot publish
a 1,500 word apologia

633
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:15,500
because you left out one "N."

634
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,500
- How many words should it be?
- <i>15?</i>

635
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,920
- 15?
- (line beeps)

636
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,386
<i>(operator) This is the operator,</i>

637
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:21,846
<i>I have an emergency
breakthrough call</i>

638
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:23,476
<i>for the Weissman household
from Susie Myerson.</i>

639
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:25,760
- What? No, thank you, operator.
- <i>Hold, please.</i>

640
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,550
<i>(Abe) Operator,
I'm declining it.</i>

641
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:29,510
Shouldn't you see
what the emergency is, Abe?

642
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:31,100
We're discussing my emergency.

643
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,930
- <i>(Susie) Hello?</i>
- Hello?

644
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:34,490
Who is this?
I'm calling for Midge.

645
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,440
Susie? It's Abe.
I'm on the phone.

646
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,446
<i>(Susie) I know. Your damn line's
been busy all morning.</i>

647
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:40,070
Well, I started the day

648
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,780
trying to call every
<i>Village Voice</i> subscriber

649
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:44,860
and apologize
to them individually.

650
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,950
- Oh, my God. - <i>(Susie)
Abe, please put Midge on.</i>

651
00:23:47,150 --> 00:23:49,200
Fine. Miriam.

652
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,330
Goodbye, Abe. 15 words.

653
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,830
It's Susie.

654
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,750
- Hello? - <i>(Susie) Did
you get into a fight</i>

655
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:58,500
with Gordon Ford
in front of everybody,

656
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,420
and I mean everybody
in show business

657
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,920
last night at Toots Shor's?

658
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:04,340
- How in the world did you know?
- <i>It made the papers.</i>

659
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:07,880
"The usual 'you had to be there'
revelry at Toots

660
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,970
seemed tame compared
to last night's showdown

661
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:13,310
between Mr. Ford
and his mouthy lady writer."

662
00:24:13,510 --> 00:24:14,890
Sounds bad out of context.

663
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,100
<i>Give me the context.</i>

664
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,020
He flubbed my joke on air,

665
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,400
and I groaned on air,

666
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,520
but it was an accidental groan,
and I apologized.

667
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,900
"It was a shocking moment,
as late night television's

668
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:26,690

lost his trademark cool.

669
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,490
<i>The aforementioned lady writer</i>

in another line of work,

672
00:24:32,190 --> 00:24:34,410
in another city,
across state lines."

673
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:35,620
Oh, my God.

674
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,250
<i>I am building up
quite a scrapbook</i>

675
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,926
<i>with all your clippings,

676
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,460
Help me out. What-what do I do?
Apologize again?

677
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,790
Normally, I'd say yes,

678
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,630
but, apparently,
you aren't great at that.

679
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,590
I mean, I have to go in
on Monday, right?

680
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,970
I-I have to show my face.

681
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:49,590
<i>Yes, you do, and bring a box.</i>

682
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,090
A box? Why should I bring a box?

683
00:24:51,290 --> 00:24:53,010
Well, you know,
when you get fired,

684
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:54,896
you want to have a box
to put your stuff in,

685
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:56,350
so bring a nice, big box.

686
00:24:56,550 --> 00:24:58,606
Well, I don't have an office,
so I don't have a lot of stuff.

687
00:24:58,630 --> 00:24:59,770
A small box will do.

688
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,110
I am so glad we figured out
the size of the box

689
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,906
you're gonna bring on Monday
when they fire you.

690
00:25:03,930 --> 00:25:05,610
So, you definitely think
I'm getting fired?

691
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:06,810
<i>I'll make some calls.</i>

692
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,610
It's a Saturday,
so all these fuckers

693
00:25:08,810 --> 00:25:11,240
are gonna be off golfing
or whacking off on their boats.

694
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,580
- (phone ringing)
- Oh, shit. - W<i>hat?</i>

695
00:25:13,770 --> 00:25:15,120
You think it's them?
To fire me?

696
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:17,540
Don't panic.
I'll-I'll keep you posted.

697
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:19,180
<i>Okay. Bye.</i>

698
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:24,340
Susie Myerson and Associates.

699
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:26,340
Wait, what?

700
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,880
Come to where?

701
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,690
(buzzer sounds)

702
00:25:46,250 --> 00:25:47,980
- Who are you?
- Who are you?

703
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,180
I'm Susie Myerson.

704
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:50,320
Get out of here.

705
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:51,820
- No.
- You?

706
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:53,530
Yeah. Why?

707
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,090
I pictured someone
taller, thicker.

708
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:56,450
- Although...
- Watch it.

709
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:57,450
Now, who the hell are you?

710
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,040
Hilarious.

711
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,460
Thank you for the gift,
by the way. Very clever.

712
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,920
- What gift?
- The call.

713
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,170
Someone tells me
there's a gift at my door,

714
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:08,500
courtesy of Susie Myerson
and Associates.

715
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:11,670
I opened the door,
and a fleet of cops hauls me off

716
00:26:11,870 --> 00:26:13,050
for a crime I did not commit.

717
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:14,840
Oh, that gift.

718
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,180
- You're welcome, Miss...
- Molly is dead.

719
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,520
- Who's Molly?
- My Irish associate.

720
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,980
She got the same call,

721
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,866
had a heart attack,
dropped dead in the kitchen.

722
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:24,350
- Jesus.
- Our Jewish friend

723
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:25,630
is on a plane to Argentina.

724
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,150
Miss Em is AWOL.

725
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:28,710
Who the fuck
are all of you people?

726
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,530
What do you mean, "who are we"?

727
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:32,200
Didn't Rose Weissman send you?

728
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:34,070
Yes.

729
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,570
Rose sent me.

730
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:36,990
- You sure?
- Well,

731
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,580
who can be sure
of anything in life, right?

732
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,450
This is bullshit, by the way.

733
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:44,250
Framing me for a ridiculous
tea room fire?

734
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:45,460
It's not gonna work.

735
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:47,290
Hang on a second, that was you?

736
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:49,340
You burned down
the greatest fucking tea room

737
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,880
in the history of tea rooms?

738
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,806
Never mind the tea, have you
ever had their whipped cream?

739
00:26:52,830 --> 00:26:54,470
- What?
- I don't know what they did to it,

740
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:56,146
whether it's extra cream
or extra sugar

741
00:26:56,170 --> 00:26:57,680
or a combination of both,

742
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,350
maybe it's the pinch of nutmeg.

743
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:02,100
God knows I have tried to make
it at home and failed miserably,

744
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,520
but there is something
about that whipped cream.

745
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,900
I hope you get
the fucking chair.

746
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,980
I didn't realize Rose Weissman
had protection.

747
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,180
Well, she does,

748
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:11,820
and a gun, and she'll use it.

749
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,286
- She's not just gonna wave it around or something.
- Okay.

750
00:27:14,310 --> 00:27:16,950
Fine. You got me.

751
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:19,490
Can we just
get down to this, please?

752
00:27:19,690 --> 00:27:20,930
Down to what?

753
00:27:22,970 --> 00:27:25,540
Rose Weissman can keep
the Upper West Side.

754
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:29,170
She just can't go above 125th
or below 60th.

755
00:27:29,370 --> 00:27:30,500
Now that Molly's dead,

756
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:32,300
she can take
Hell's Kitchen if she wants,

757
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:34,880
but she better bone up on
limericks and the potato famine.

758
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:37,800
What? Not good enough?

759
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,430
Hey, I'm just the muscle.

760
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,350
I'll take it to Rose,
see what she says.

761
00:27:41,550 --> 00:27:44,140
Female muscle. Shit.
I should have thought of that.

762
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:45,620
Yeah, they never see you coming.

763
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:46,940
Well, not you.

764
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,690
Well, it's been a delight.

765
00:27:48,890 --> 00:27:50,230
That outfit suits you,
by the way.

766
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:52,400
Some women your age
just look silly in stripes.

767
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:54,780
Tell Rose Weissman
this is a good deal.

768
00:27:54,980 --> 00:27:56,706
Hey, if they just booked you,
why are you here?

769
00:27:56,730 --> 00:27:58,050
Why aren't you
in the county jail?

770
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,420
I have priors.

771
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,260
♪ ♪

772
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:10,130
So...

773
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:12,500
- this is different.
- Can't believe it.

774
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:14,880
He was supposed to help me
with her. Instead,

775
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,520
he's taking up
two tables over there,

776
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,266
and she shows up at the door,
first thing she does

777
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,890
is ask for a family
and friends discount.

778
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,140
Did you give it to her?

779
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,720
Well, she's my mother.

780
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,310
(Shirley) Can you believe it?

781
00:28:24,510 --> 00:28:26,850
She's telling me
how to pick a melon?

782
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:29,980
I can sniff out a ripe melon
in Jersey if I had to.

783
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,420
You should've slapped her face.

784
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:32,860
I just had a manicure.

785
00:28:33,060 --> 00:28:35,030
- Prunes do nothing.
- They do something for me.

786
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:37,490
Bullshit. It's got nothing
to do with food.

787
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:39,280
Willpower and a schedule.

788
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,626
What if you have to be
somewhere? What're you gonna do?

789
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:43,690
I could pull the fire alarm
and clear the place out.

790
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,466
And then they'll just come back
tomorrow with their rabbi,

791
00:28:45,490 --> 00:28:47,710
barber, and canasta club.
Oh, good.

792
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:49,190
Your dad's friend
pulled a nickel

793
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,640
out of the waitress's ear again.

794
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,040
Hey. Hi.
What are you guys staring at?

795
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,500
In this corner,

796
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,880
the undefeated purse snacks
champ, Shirley Maisel.

797
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,720
And in that corner,
the challenger

798
00:28:58,920 --> 00:29:00,430
and prune skeptic,
Moishe Maisel.

799
00:29:00,630 --> 00:29:01,800
And they are not together?

800
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Not by a long shot.

801
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:04,970
- So, two bad tippers.
- Bye, folks.

802
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,310
Come again. Who am I kidding?

803
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:09,640
Well, sorry that your dreams
are coming to an end,

804
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:11,196
but before they do,
can I get ten minutes

805
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,980
- when the band breaks?
- (Moishe) An apology

806
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:14,696
and some music lessons
would help a lot.

807
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,190
Fuck this shit.

808
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:18,240
- You're on.
- (Shirley) Moishe, we were

809
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:19,956
- enjoying the music. - (Moishe)
Everyone's so sensitive

810
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,920
- these days.
- That's it? - (indistinct chatter)

811
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:27,660
(woman) Is the band coming back?

812
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:30,040
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

813
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,800
- I'm Mrs. Maisel...
- (Shirley) Miriam!

814
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:34,290
That's my former
daughter-in-law. Miriam!

815
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:36,056
- So pale.
- What are you doing up there?

816
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,420
- I'm going to do my act.
- (Shirley) For who?

817
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:42,140
For all the nice people looking
very perplexed right now.

818
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,476
(Moishe) Leave her alone,
Shirley.

819
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:45,510
If she wants to try
and tell a joke,

820
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:47,010
let her learn the hard way.

821
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:49,430
My butcher is funnier.
He's not funny.

822
00:29:49,630 --> 00:29:50,890
Nice-looking. She should sing.

823
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,270
I'm not a singer,

824
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:54,230
but I am currently a writer
for <i>The Gordon...</i>

825
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:56,440
Wait, I was distracted.
Miriam, start your act again.

826
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,190
I haven't really started
my act yet, Shirley.

827
00:29:59,390 --> 00:30:00,826
Trust me, when she starts it,
you won't laugh.

828
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:01,850
Pop, shut up.

829
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,700
Shut up, he says,
the fruit of my loins.

830
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,246
(Joel) If you're not gonna help,
then get out.

831
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:06,410
I am helping.

832
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:08,200
She needs to rethink
this career.

833
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:10,046
- Who else would tell her?
- (Shirley) Miriam,

834
00:30:10,070 --> 00:30:12,210
ignore him.
Pretend he's not there.

835
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,460
Okay, so, I am a single woman
living in New York.

836
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,660
Me too.

837
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,960
You're not single, Ma.

838
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,760
- Joel, really?
- Sorry.

839
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:22,220
Have you ladies ever approached
a subway station,

840
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:24,016
and it's really dark
at the bottom of the stairs?

841
00:30:24,040 --> 00:30:25,680
They don't light them properly.

842
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,060
That was a rhetorical
question, Shirley.

843
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:30,180
She only asked it
to set something up.

844
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,446
Not that it was going anywhere.

845
00:30:31,470 --> 00:30:32,910
So, the other night,
I'm heading down

846
00:30:33,050 --> 00:30:34,316
these really dark stairs, and...

847
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:35,776
(Shirley) You didn't
have a flashlight?

848
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,190
I have two.

849
00:30:37,390 --> 00:30:38,570
One for light

850
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,400
and one to use as a weapon.

851
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,706
- (bubbie) She's so small.
- Shirley, you're blinding me.

852
00:30:43,730 --> 00:30:45,820
Just like the attacker.
That's good, right?

853
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:47,870
Okay, moving on.

854
00:30:48,070 --> 00:30:49,510
Uh, yesterday,
the principal tells me

855
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:51,010
my son is sleeping
during class...

856
00:30:51,070 --> 00:30:51,870
(Shirley) What happened
to Ethan?

857
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:54,080
- He's sleeping in class.
- Why?

858
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,080
Because he doesn't drink
coffee? I don't know.

859
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,130
Okay, folks,
the show is up here.

860
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:00,550
I-I... forgot where I was.

861
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,590
For the love of God,
do not start again.

862
00:31:02,790 --> 00:31:03,970
Here, I have a joke.

863
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,470
Guy walks into a bar

864
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,930
holding a one-foot-tall man
playing the piano.

865
00:31:08,130 --> 00:31:09,510
The bartender says,

866
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:11,180
"My genie must be
hard of hearing.

867
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,180
I didn't ask
for a 12-inch pianist."

868
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:14,190
(laughter)

869
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:17,060
Miriam, there you are.

870
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:20,360
I have to tell you, I thought
you were just terrific up there.

871
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,030
Gee, thank you, Shirley.

872
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:24,030
I enjoyed every minute of it.

873
00:31:24,230 --> 00:31:25,780
Is this how your shows
always go?

874
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,910
No. Most of the time,
I get to tell a joke.

875
00:31:28,110 --> 00:31:29,990
Really? That's so interesting.

876
00:31:30,190 --> 00:31:32,290
Well, it was a delight.

877
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:33,750
Listen, while I have you here,

878
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:35,230
I need some information
from you.

879
00:31:35,410 --> 00:31:36,210
- About?
- Mei.

880
00:31:36,410 --> 00:31:38,080
Where is she? Joel told me

881
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:39,760
she was interviewing
for a doctor job.

882
00:31:39,950 --> 00:31:41,710
Yes. She was.

883
00:31:41,910 --> 00:31:44,186
- How long does that take?
- I don't, I don't really know.

884
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:46,056
How many questions can they ask?
When I go to the doctor,

885
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,390
all he does is take my pulse
and bum a cigarette.

886
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,276
Well, I think it's a bit more
involved than that.

887
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,890
- So, you do know something.
- Me? No.

888
00:31:53,090 --> 00:31:56,980
Just tell me,
is she carrying high or low?

889
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:59,150
I've been knitting
pink booties and blue booties.

890
00:31:59,350 --> 00:32:00,940
I'm completely in the dark.

891
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,650
- Well...
- This baby can't come into the world with cold feet.

892
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:05,280
What a terrible start.

893
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:07,150
- Shirley...
- I'm going crazy, Miriam.

894
00:32:07,350 --> 00:32:09,620
Please, just tell me. Something.

895
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,820
Anything.

896
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:12,206
I think she went
to visit her family.

897
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:14,120
- Where's her family?
- In... China.

898
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,250
Wasn't there
a revolution in China?

899
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:19,250
Yes, there was, which is why
she's not back yet.

900
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:20,450
Did she enlist?

901
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,300
No, it's just,
there's a lot of red tape.

902
00:32:22,490 --> 00:32:24,760
(chuckles) Get it?
Never mind. She'll be home soon.

903
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:28,070
Will you excuse me?
I-I think I left the...

904
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:33,220
You didn't tell Shirley
about Mei, did you?

905
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:36,310
- Why?
- Because she just grilled me in the ladies' room about Mei.

906
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,480
"Why is she gone so long?
When is she coming back?

907
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,310
Is she carrying high or low?"

908
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:42,236
Your mother has
a terrible doctor, by the way.

909
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,150
She really needs to see
someone else.

910
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,576
Anyhow, I was cornered,
so I said

911
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,000
she was visiting
her family in China

912
00:32:47,190 --> 00:32:49,670
and she can't get out because of
the revolution and then I ran.

913
00:32:50,090 --> 00:32:51,700
You said Mei was in China?

914
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,040
I didn't know what to say, Joel.

915
00:32:54,230 --> 00:32:55,756
How is it when other people
don't know what to say,

916
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,046
they say,
"I don't know what to say,"

917
00:32:57,070 --> 00:32:58,426
but when you don't know
what to say, you say,

918
00:32:58,450 --> 00:32:59,586
"She's in China
and can't get out

919
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:00,716
'cause there's a revolution."

920
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:02,540
- Because I'm an artist, Joel.
- Great.

921
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:05,000
Hey, this is not my fault.

922
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,630
I know.

923
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:08,130
I'm sorry. It's mine. I...

924
00:33:08,330 --> 00:33:09,630
Really, I'll fix it.

925
00:33:09,830 --> 00:33:11,680
Okay.

926
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:13,226
Are you gonna fix it now,
or should I...

927
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:14,570
Back way's good.

928
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,870
(sighs)

929
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:40,670
(grunting)

930
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,420
(door opens)

931
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,000
Why are you grunting?

932
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,960
- Did you do this?
- You woke me up. Do what?

933
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,210
Move Ethan off his
Saturday sleep mark?

934
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:50,130
He was in the way
of the bathroom.

935
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,260
Well, hop over him.
We all agreed, we'd hop.

936
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,460
I never agreed to hop.

937
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:54,976
Well, then hold it in
till morning.

938
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,600
You know what?
This whole thing is ridiculous.

939
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,060
Papa, stop.

940
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:03,310
He'll never know he was off
his Saturday sleep mark.

941
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,150
Papa, we are on a path with this

942
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,860
and we need to stick to it.

943
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,780
The whole point
of this is trust,

944
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,616
and if he wakes up
and he's not where he's been,

945
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,900
he may not know where he is.

946
00:34:12,100 --> 00:34:14,620
He's lived here all his life.
He'll know where he is.

947
00:34:14,820 --> 00:34:18,490
Do not move him off
his mark again. Promise me.

948
00:34:18,690 --> 00:34:21,390
I make no promises.

949
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,330
Papa.

950
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,540
You claim to be
a man of science.

951
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:28,170
I don't claim, I am.

952
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:30,300
This is science,
and you are the last person

953
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,510
- who should be doubting it.
- Miriam,

954
00:34:32,710 --> 00:34:34,970
you know full well
I'm experiencing

955
00:34:35,170 --> 00:34:36,470
a dark night of the soul

956
00:34:36,670 --> 00:34:38,510
from this whole
Carol Channing thing.

957
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:42,140
Please, stop further
assassinating my character.

958
00:34:42,340 --> 00:34:43,340
Remember the cookie?

959
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,730
The cookie? What cookie?

960
00:34:44,930 --> 00:34:46,826
When I was seven, you took
a black and white cookie

961
00:34:46,850 --> 00:34:48,940
and you broke it
into 16 parts, remember?

962
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,030
- No.
- It was a reward system.

963
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,610
Each time I proved to you I
could properly use a semicolon,

964
00:34:53,810 --> 00:34:55,166
I got a piece of cookie
and then Noah

965
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:56,570
found my cookie pieces
and ate them

966
00:34:56,770 --> 00:34:58,450
and when I told you
what he did, you said,

967
00:34:58,650 --> 00:34:59,706
"I don't want
to hear about this.

968
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:00,966
Work it out amongst yourselves."

969
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:02,200
So?

970
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,960
You abandoned me
and my cookie lesson,

971
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,500
and to this day I have no idea
how to use a semicolon.

972
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,170
It's used to indicate a pause,

973
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:10,350
- usually between two...
- Too late.

974
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,820
Do not move him.

975
00:35:23,620 --> 00:35:25,160
(doors close)

976
00:35:26,870 --> 00:35:28,230
Mommy?

977
00:35:28,430 --> 00:35:30,370
(phone ringing)

978
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,740
Hello?

979
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:37,280
Whoa, slow down, Pop.

980
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:39,450
I'm sorry,
I didn't get that last...

981
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:42,950
What? Pop? Are you in a closet?

982
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:45,120
Why are you so...

983
00:35:45,320 --> 00:35:47,830
I can't... I don't...

984
00:35:48,030 --> 00:35:50,600
I... I'm coming over.

985
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:54,340
Hello?

986
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:57,510
Ma? Pop?

987
00:35:57,710 --> 00:35:58,900
Joel!

988
00:36:00,820 --> 00:36:01,850
What are you doing here?

989
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,610
Is everything all right?
When you called

990
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,276
you sounded like you had
a bag over your head.

991
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,100
I thought you'd been kidnapped.

992
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:07,390
No, not kidnapped.

993
00:36:07,590 --> 00:36:09,100
I did have a bag
over my head, though.

994
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:11,360
- Why?
- Trying to muffle the sound.

995
00:36:11,560 --> 00:36:12,900
- Of what?
- Sensitive topics.

996
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,500
- Neighbors have ears.
- Moishe?

997
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:18,490
It's okay. It's my son, Joel.

998
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:20,370
(indistinct chatter)

999
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:22,620
All right, you're here.
Be useful.

1000
00:36:22,820 --> 00:36:24,910
What do you mean, "be useful"?
What's going on here?

1001
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:27,290
Shh. Why are you yelling?
Read the room.

1002
00:36:27,490 --> 00:36:29,120
Listen, we're gonna get her out.

1003
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:30,886
- Get who out?
- Your girl. It's all planned,

1004
00:36:30,910 --> 00:36:32,516
- just a couple more details.
- What's planned?

1005
00:36:32,540 --> 00:36:34,260
Now, I didn't want
to involve you directly...

1006
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:36,420
Plausible deniability...
But as long as you're here,

1007
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,186
- you can answer a few questions.
- Pop...

1008
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:39,640
Don't worry. These are the guys

1009
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:42,050
that got the 13 Jews
out of Germany.

1010
00:36:42,250 --> 00:36:44,010
- Oh, no.
- They are the best.

1011
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,980
That one there
is the original guy's son.

1012
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,520
The original guy's dead

1013
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,696
and the son's a bit of a yutz,
but he has the plane.

1014
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:51,020
Pop, I have to talk to you.

1015
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:53,900
I know, communication seems
very important to you today.

1016
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,950
Later. For now, when you say
she's in China... where?

1017
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:01,240
I mean, I know it's a big place.
I don't need an address,

1018
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:03,830
- unless you have one.
- There's no address.

1019
00:37:04,030 --> 00:37:06,330
Okay. Is there
a street name, perhaps?

1020
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:09,500
Or a landmark?
Uh, maybe a library nearby?

1021
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:11,000
(speaks Yiddish)

1022
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,966
He's asking what the weather's
like. They run cold.

1023
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,630
Really? These guys are the best?

1024
00:37:14,830 --> 00:37:16,090
You know a good extraction team

1025
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:17,596
that's just hanging around
waiting to extract?

1026
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:18,420
No.

1027
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,630
(speaks Yiddish)

1028
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:22,850
(men) Oh. Mmm.

1029
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,510
Shirley, we're working here.

1030
00:37:24,710 --> 00:37:28,140
I don't see anyone complaining
about some fresh Danish, do you?

1031
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,440
They're planning a very
sensitive covert mission.

1032
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,610
They can't think with you
galloping in and out

1033
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,576
like you're pulling a carriage
around Central Park!

1034
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,400
If I'm a horse,
then you're an ass.

1035
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,570
Okay, enough
barnyard animal insults.

1036
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:40,990
Can you two, please j...

1037
00:37:41,190 --> 00:37:42,460
(sighs)

1038
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,240
There's something
I have to tell you guys.

1039
00:37:53,370 --> 00:37:54,710
What's the matter?

1040
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:57,670
It's about Mei and me.

1041
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:59,550
There is no more Mei and me.

1042
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:02,470
No. Joely, don't worry,
we're getting her out of China.

1043
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:04,850
She's not in China, Ma.
She's in Chicago.

1044
00:38:05,050 --> 00:38:06,600
Oh, well that should be easier.

1045
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,850
She moved to Chicago, Ma.

1046
00:38:09,050 --> 00:38:12,270
- But...
- The-the baby.

1047
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:14,100
There's no baby anymore.

1048
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,320
Oh, no. Oh, Joel.

1049
00:38:16,510 --> 00:38:17,750
She lost it?

1050
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,780
Yeah. She lost it.

1051
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,610
I'm so sorry.

1052
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:24,740
Oh, honey.

1053
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:27,870
But you can try again
when you get married.

1054
00:38:28,070 --> 00:38:30,050
We're not getting married, Ma.

1055
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:35,790
- Are you okay?
- Sure.

1056
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:39,000
Would you like something to eat?
There's so much food.

1057
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:40,920
- So much food.
- No.

1058
00:38:41,120 --> 00:38:44,010
Thank you. I have work to do.

1059
00:38:44,210 --> 00:38:46,260
I'm gonna make you
a to-go package.

1060
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:48,240
I better tell the boys.

1061
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:55,370

1063
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,286
(man) It was supposed to come in
today. They said they mailed it.

1064
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,320
Uh...

1065
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,450

1066
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,870
(Doris) <i>The Gordon Ford Show.</i>

1067
00:39:13,070 --> 00:39:15,460
Yes, you are right.

1068
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,670
Thank you for bringing that
to our attention.

1069
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:20,170
- Thank you. Thank you.
- (Mike) Oh, good.

1070
00:39:20,370 --> 00:39:21,670
You brought a box.

1071
00:39:21,870 --> 00:39:23,420
(Gordon) Everyone
to the railing.

1072
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,436
- (man) To the railing, people.
- (woman) Railing, guys.

1073
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,740
(Gordon) All right,
listen, guys,

1074
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,800
we have too many relatives
coming to the shows.

1075
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,680
Mothers, brothers,
uncles, aunts.

1076
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:32,270
They're not the best laughers.

1077
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:34,356
- Show some restraint?
- Yes, Mr. Ford. - You got it.

1078
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,300
Got couple other things
we got to deal with, too.

1079
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,290
Morning, all.

1080
00:39:40,790 --> 00:39:42,360
- Look who's here.
- (Gordon) Okay,

1081
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,536
looks like George brought
a few of the network bigwigs

1082
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,950
down for an unexpected visit.

1083
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,570
Hello, Charlie. Hello, Isaac.

1084
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:49,046
Hello, third person
I don't know.

1085
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:50,160
Syd Greenberg, Mr. Ford.

1086
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,120
This is a friendly ambush,
we swear.

1087
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:54,120
Not sure there is such a thing.

1088
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,660
Come on up.

1089
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,860
We'll finish this later.

1090
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,980

<i>(narrator) The young bears

00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:10,300
<i>they're learning necessary

- Ethan.

1095
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,446
- <i>(narrator continues indistinctly)</i>
- Time for bed.

1096
00:40:14,470 --> 00:40:17,810
I sleep in spot
number three tonight.

1097
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:19,980
How about sleeping
in your bed tonight?

1098
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,900
My therapist says
I'm not ready yet.

1099
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:24,990
Okay.

1100
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:28,160
- <i>(narrator) After that...</i>
- (TV mutes)

1101
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:31,930
Okay, now, Ethan.

1102
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:36,250
Look at me and not at the bear
on TV. Up here.

1103
00:40:36,450 --> 00:40:38,670
Hello. Now, Ethan,

1104
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:40,210
we must discuss

1105
00:40:40,410 --> 00:40:43,050
the rationale behind
your sleeping in the hallway,

1106
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:46,010
or the very lack of it,
actually.

1107
00:40:46,210 --> 00:40:48,300
I understand that,
for some reason,

1108
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,590
you are afraid of your bed.

1109
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:52,930
Well, you should know that fear

1110
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:54,720
is very natural.

1111
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:57,520
It's there to help you survive.

1112
00:40:57,720 --> 00:41:01,020
It tells you to run
when something large with teeth

1113
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,480
is going to eat you,

1114
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,730
or to duck when a rock
has been thrown at your head.

1115
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,780
And there are so many things
in this life

1116
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:11,800
to be legitimately afraid of.

1117
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,450
Have you heard of Park Slope?

1118
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,330
- No.
- Recently,

1119
00:41:16,530 --> 00:41:18,750
a United Airlines airplane

1120
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:21,040
and a Trans World airplane

1121
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:23,630
collided in midair, just...

1122
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:25,920
flew right into each other,

1123
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,010
and the wreckage rained down

1124
00:41:28,210 --> 00:41:30,380
onto a Park Slope intersection,

1125
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,430
killing every passenger on board

1126
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,930
and six people on the ground.

1127
00:41:35,130 --> 00:41:37,890
Six people just
walking down the street,

1128
00:41:38,090 --> 00:41:40,390
going to the market or to school

1129
00:41:40,590 --> 00:41:43,520
or the movies,
got instantly crushed

1130
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,980
by falling pieces
of flaming metal

1131
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:47,690
and various arms

1132
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:49,700
and legs and torsos

1133
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:52,200
from previously intact bodies.

1134
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,530
That's pretty scary, right?

1135
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:56,700
- Yes.
- Yes, it is.

1136
00:41:56,900 --> 00:41:58,700
There are wars,

1137
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,960
floods, sometimes tigers
escape from the zoo.

1138
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,960
Lightning can strike you,
even on a sunny day.

1139
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:08,590
You could eat bad clams
and be evacuating

1140
00:42:08,790 --> 00:42:11,300
from every orifice in your body
for a week.

1141
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:15,050
- But I hate clams.
- Hating clams won't keep you safe, Ethan.

1142
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:18,600
Y-You could fall down a well
that you never knew was there.

1143
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,430
Go flying through a windshield

1144
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:22,850
when your daddy stops too fast.

1145
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:25,770
You could accidentally spell

1146
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:28,820
Carol Channing's name wrong

1147
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:33,320
and instantly become a man
who must be apologized for...

1148
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:34,740
in print.

1149
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:36,200
Yes.

1150
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:37,780
Yes, I think you're beginning

1151
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,580
to understand
what I'm telling you.

1152
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:43,000
It's time you learn
to live with fear.

1153
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:44,920
To accept it's there,

1154
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:47,540
and there is not enough
tape in the world

1155
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:49,590
to keep you safe.

1156
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:51,420
And though your mommy
and your daddy

1157
00:42:51,620 --> 00:42:53,090
and possibly even your therapist

1158
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:55,590
mean well by making you think

1159
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:57,430
that sleeping on the floor
is a mark

1160
00:42:57,630 --> 00:43:00,430
of being a big brave boy,

1161
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:03,600
your grandpa is here to tell you

1162
00:43:03,800 --> 00:43:06,690
death comes for all of us,

1163
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:09,040
even the brave.

1164
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:11,940
Now,

1165
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:13,746
would you like me to read you
a bedtime story?

1166
00:43:13,770 --> 00:43:15,070
<i>(Gordon) How has</i>

1167
00:43:15,270 --> 00:43:18,080
working with Thelonious Monk
influenced how you play?

1168
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:19,950
Well, no one hits the keys
like Thelonious.

1169
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:21,950
- No, no argument here.
- He finds notes

1170
00:43:22,150 --> 00:43:23,460
I didn't even know existed,

1171
00:43:23,650 --> 00:43:25,870
and I can't say I haven't
borrowed a few over the years.

1172
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,756
- (laughter) - (Gordon)
Well, what with B<i>lue Train</i>

1173
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,040
and <i>Giant Steps,</i>

1174
00:43:29,240 --> 00:43:31,056
you've been hitting all
the right notes lately, John.

1175
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,680
Thank you so much
for being here tonight.

1176
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:34,720
Ladies and gentlemen,
the great John Coltrane.

1178
00:43:38,030 --> 00:43:39,760
(Gordon) Yeah. Oh.
Hold it, everybody.

1179
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:42,430
I got a little announcement
to make. As of this week,

1180
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:45,190
<i>The Gordon Ford Show</i>

1181

1182
00:43:47,430 --> 00:43:49,190
- (audience cheers)

1183
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:52,570
(grunts) Yes! Yes.

1184
00:43:52,770 --> 00:43:54,490
I have you, my viewers,

1185
00:43:54,690 --> 00:43:56,420
to thank for that.
Bring it out here, guys.

1186
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:03,626
Now, ladies and gentlemen,
I don't thank them enough,

1187
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:06,710
my staff, my crew, my writers.
Come on out here, guys.

1188

(indistinct chatter)

1189
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:11,090
(Gordon) They are the best
in the business.

1190
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:13,630
I would not be here tonight
without them.

1191
00:44:13,830 --> 00:44:15,420
Grab some champagne, everybody,

1192
00:44:15,620 --> 00:44:17,130
and grab some at home, folks.

1193
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:19,340
- We'll see you tomorrow.

- Oh, no,

1233
00:46:03,560 --> 00:46:05,990
I wore these to the office
today. This is fashion.

1234

Yippee!

00:46:08,110 --> 00:46:09,450

Well, seriously, it's less nuts

1239
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:16,056
than a lot of your other getups.

1240
00:46:16,080 --> 00:46:18,170
I'll have you know
I played a magic snowball

in the Hadassah Women's Zionist
Organization winter pageant,

1242
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:22,090
and Sonja Henie was there,

1243
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:24,226
and she strongly encouraged my
parents to get me some lessons.

1244
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:26,130
- Yeah, that's not a compliment.
- (Midge) Fine.

00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,340
Not anymore, apparently.

1254
00:47:04,540 --> 00:47:06,850
- Need a medic?
- Thanks, I'm good.

1255
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,320
I was a candy striper
in college,

1256
00:47:08,420 --> 00:47:09,620
so I have some medical skills.

1257
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,180
They called me the Enema Queen.

1258
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:13,890
Well, I don't need one of those,
but if I ever do...

1259
00:47:14,090 --> 00:47:15,980
You're making me dizzy.

1260
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:17,620
Oh, if I had a nickel...

1261
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:21,116
Okay, all right, maybe I need
a little bit of help.

1262
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:23,070
Glad to be of service.

1263
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:25,200
Ooh! What was that?

1264
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,620
What do you think?

1265
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:28,740
I... think you tried to kiss me.

1266
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,830
Yeah, that's pretty much
what that was.

1267
00:47:31,030 --> 00:47:32,216
Didn't stick
the landing, though.

1268
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,040
I'm sorry,
but don't you hate me?

1269
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,040
How could I hate
those eyes, those lips?

1270
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:38,840
Toots Shor's.
I yelled at you, a lot.

1271
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,266
Are you kidding?
That was fantastic.

1272
00:47:40,290 --> 00:47:41,760
It was Tracy-Hepburn.

1273
00:47:41,950 --> 00:47:43,840
Loy and Powell.
Robinson-La Motta.

1274
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,080
In the paper it was more like,
"Insubordinate nobody

1275
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:47,550
yells at major TV personality."

1276
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:50,430
Look at us now, number one.

1277
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:51,930
I won that argument, by the way.

1278
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:54,310
Oh, but that's...

1279
00:47:54,510 --> 00:47:56,440
- Biting your tongue?
- No.

1280
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,520
- Well, then can I?
- Aren't you married?

1281
00:47:58,720 --> 00:47:59,880
I'm not that kind of married.

1282
00:47:59,930 --> 00:48:01,250
Mm, I think
that's what my husband

1283
00:48:01,430 --> 00:48:03,430
told his girlfriend
before he became my ex-husband.

1284
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:04,880
He sounds like a cad.

1285
00:48:07,380 --> 00:48:08,820
Your butt getting cold?

1286
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:10,410
I'll admit, I can't feel it,

1287
00:48:10,610 --> 00:48:11,700
but you can, if you want.

1288
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:15,310
And with that,
she skated off into the sunset.

1289
00:48:24,190 --> 00:48:26,260
This is a sight
I never thought I'd see.

1290
00:48:26,460 --> 00:48:29,050
Yeah, well, Sonja Henie
told me to take lessons, too.

1291
00:48:29,250 --> 00:48:31,560
I told her to suck it,
Norwegian style.

1292
00:48:31,750 --> 00:48:33,060
And I got to hit the john.

1293
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:34,720
There's one by the skate rental.

1294
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:37,000
A toilet that's been peed on
by a million little kids

1295
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:39,350
who can't get their tights down
in time? No thanks.

1296
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:41,790
I'll find something sanitary.

1297
00:48:55,220 --> 00:48:56,750
Mike, you seen George?

1298
00:48:56,950 --> 00:48:58,710
I've looked all over.
He needs to sign this.

1299
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:02,170
Yeah, bet he does.
(sighs) Gimme.

1300
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:04,130
Been forging
George's goddamn signature

1301
00:49:04,330 --> 00:49:06,050
for ten goddamn years.

1302
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:09,190
Illegible G, loopy R.

1303
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:13,850
- Hey there, Mike.
- I just want to know,

1304
00:49:14,050 --> 00:49:16,270
is yours the last face
I'll see in this life?

1305
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:18,180
I just wanted to say
congratulations.

1306
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:19,640
Not bad, number one.

1307
00:49:19,840 --> 00:49:20,940
Yeah, doesn't stink.

1308
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:22,690
Why aren't you celebrating?

1309
00:49:22,890 --> 00:49:25,230
I booked Truman Capote

1310
00:49:25,430 --> 00:49:27,366
for next week, but
he's doing Jack Paar this week,

1311
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:28,950
so I got to cancel
'cause we got a rule.

1312
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:31,950
And Doris Day's ostrich
got sick, so she postponed.

1313
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:33,370
Yeah, she's got an ostrich.

1314
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:35,790
And the British band
that I don't even like fell out

1315
00:49:35,990 --> 00:49:37,546
because their drummer died
in a hot air balloon accident.

1316
00:49:37,570 --> 00:49:40,290
My talent board is a mess,

1317
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:42,050
and my talent board
is all I care about.

1318
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:43,256
Well, that
and the Christmas tree lot.

1319
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:44,710
It's a farm, not a lot.

1320
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:46,100
I stand corrected.

1321
00:49:47,520 --> 00:49:49,670
You know, we're bringing
Sophie Lennon back this week.

1322
00:49:49,870 --> 00:49:52,220
I did not know.

1323
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:53,600
She's a good guest.

1324
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:56,100
People tune in for her,
so... thanks.

1325
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:58,600
I'm sorry, little louder?

1326
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,060
You really drop her?

1327
00:50:00,260 --> 00:50:02,236
After getting her on that
game show? All that's true?

1328
00:50:02,260 --> 00:50:04,190
I have my priorities.

1329
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:05,390
What about the money?

1330
00:50:05,560 --> 00:50:06,870
Money comes, money goes.

1331
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:10,200
Let's lunch next week,

1332
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:11,820
if you're available.

1333
00:50:12,020 --> 00:50:13,200
Really? A real lunch?

1334
00:50:13,400 --> 00:50:14,570
Yeah, a real lunch.

1335
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:16,376
I don't have to make it?
Someone else will?

1336
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:17,440
- Yes.
- And it's not lunch

1337
00:50:17,610 --> 00:50:19,950
where I show up,
and you say, "Fuck off,

1338
00:50:20,150 --> 00:50:21,920
- keep walking"?
- Closing my door now.

1339

Yep.

1360
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,550
