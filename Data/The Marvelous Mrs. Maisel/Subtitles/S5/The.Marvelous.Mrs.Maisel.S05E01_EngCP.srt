1
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,320
Ah, come on. No.

2
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:13,410
No. No.

3
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,330
It's got to be...

4
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:17,830
- What is that?
- ♪ <i>Tainted love</i> ♪

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,960
- ♪ <i>Now I know I've got to...</i>
- No.

6
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:24,090
Where are the...?
Damn it.

7
00:00:24,290 --> 00:00:26,840
Why can't anything ever be
where it's supposed to be

8
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,270
when I need to...

9
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,010
- Did you see it there?
- I did not.

10
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,316
I was digging through this bag
for ten minutes,

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:33,340
and you just sat there?

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:34,736
I thought
you were looking for a pen.

13
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,896
Why would I be
looking for a pen?

14
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,026
Because you often
look for a pen...

15
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:38,236
There's a pen right there
on the table. Two pens.

16
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:39,816
- When a thought occurs to you.
- You're the one taking notes.

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,616
Not everything that happens
to you is somebody else's fault.

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,770
Okay. Should I write that down
with one of the two pens?

19
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:46,970
- Do you remember...
- Yes, I remember where I was.

20
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,570
I should shave my head.

21
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,700
She'd just love that.

22
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,200
I always remember where I was.

23
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:55,546
I can keep several complex
thoughts in my head at one time.

24
00:00:55,570 --> 00:00:58,330
That's why NASA keeps begging me
to move to Florida.

25
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:03,130
Four o'clock in the morning,
the phone rings

26
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:04,806
because that's
when she finishes her work.

27
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:05,630
Doesn't matter that
the rest of us have

28
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:06,960
to be in a lab at 8:00 a.m.

29
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:08,550
I mean, she's just so...

30
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,870
And everything has to be...
Plus, there's the whole...

31
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,140
- Finish the thought.
- What?

32
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,356
You're supposed to be working
on finishing your thoughts.

33
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:18,146
- I am finishing my thoughts.
- Well, in your head, yes, but out loud...

34
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:20,270
I'm tired of
being criticized by you.

35
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,940
By her.
It's not my fault

36
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:23,776
that everyone in the world
is slower than I am.

37
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:24,900
They always were.

38
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,826
The only person I could
ever talk to was Grandpa.

39
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,530
That's it.
Are you staying over there?

40
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,400
I thought we were
doing the couch today.

41
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,326
You said we were working
on proximity issues.

42
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,780
Sure. Sorry.

43
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:35,246
You're the one
who set the agenda.

44
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:36,390
I just wanted some Klonopin.

45
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:37,870
I'm all settled. Good?

46
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:40,110
- I don't want bangs.
- You don't have to get bangs.

47
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,710
Who calls people
at 4:00 in the morning?

48
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,750
Huh? I'm working on my PhD.
That's important, too.

49
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,190
I mean, does the woman not know

50
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:48,480
that Reno and Boston aren't
in same time zone?

51
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:54,356
- What are you writing?
- You wouldn't understand.

52
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,390
Well, make me understand.

53
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:57,640
Molecular kinetic sequencing?

54
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,236
That's what you'd like me
to make you understand?

55
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:00,946
I thought you were
writing about your mother.

56
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:03,690
Not everything in the world
revolves around...

57
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,440
I am trying to figure out
how to use DNA mutations

58
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,240
to change the very trajectory
of disease and rearrange it

59
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,820
so we can control the very
basic process in which we...

60
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,760
Wait.

61
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,500
Okay, I did it.

62
00:02:20,690 --> 00:02:22,210
You did? Are you sure?

63
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,250
- Want to check my work?
- No.

64
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:26,880
I believe you.

65
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,710
My God, Esther, that's amazing.

66
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:33,170
I mean, what you've done,
right here in my office,

67
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:35,510
that's a monumental achievement.

68
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,930
Oh, yeah?

69
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:38,470
Well, tell it to my mother!

70
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:50,070
How the fuck was I ever
convinced to use a top sheet?!

71
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,710
God.

72
00:02:54,170 --> 00:02:56,030
- Susie somebody's office.
<i>- Susie.</i>

73
00:02:56,230 --> 00:02:57,780
Oh, good.
I thought you weren't there.

74
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,240
- Who is this?
- <i>It's Rose.</i>

75
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:01,080
Miriam is very ill.

76
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,250
What? No.

77
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,926
No, no, no. She doesn't get it
till the 14th.

78
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:06,910
- I got it marked on the calendar.
- I<i>t's not that.</i>

79
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:09,750
She came home very late
last night, practically frozen.

80
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:11,750
What the fuck was she doing
out in a blizzard?

81
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,030
<i>I was hoping you could tell me.</i>

82
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,880
Well, she's your daughter.
You live with her.

83
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:17,130
She's your client,
and she's never home.

84
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:19,066
I'm not the one who was supposed
to teach her about snow.

85
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,430
That one's squarely on you.

86
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:23,600
Well, whosever fault it is,
she got home a block of ice.

87
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:26,100
Her coat was wool,
so it shrank on her,

88
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,220
and we had to borrow
garden shears from the super

89
00:03:28,390 --> 00:03:29,810
to cut it off her.

90
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:31,970
We threw her in a hot shower
and put her into bed.

91
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:34,400
The doctor came.
She's got hypothermia.

92
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,490
- Jesus.
- <i>She's so agitated.</i>

93
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,450
She can't sleep.
She just lies there, babbling.

94
00:03:39,650 --> 00:03:42,080
So we need you to come over
and interpret for us.

95
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,370
You speak Miriam's language

96
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:45,410
<i>and are familiar with
all that showbiz patois.</i>

97
00:03:45,610 --> 00:03:48,000
- Uh, okay, yeah, I'll be right over.
- G<i>ood.</i>

98
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,500
Now, when you get here,
be careful not to mention toes.

99
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,880
There's a chance
she may lose one or two of them.

100
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,710
She's gonna lose her toes?

101
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,186
We're hoping just
the left middle one.

102
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,726
She'll still be able
to walk somewhat normally,

103
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,050
and fitting into narrow shoes

104
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,610
will actually be easier
without it.

105
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:02,430
So, lemonade.

106
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,700
- <i>We'll see you soon?</i>
- Yeah. Bye.

107
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,480
Hello? I'm here.

108
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,060
- Susie?
- Yeah.

109
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,190
That door was locked.
How did you get in?

110
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:14,940
- I still have my key.
- Why?

111
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:16,780
I don't know.
It's on my key necklace.

112
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,150
I just forgot to take it off.

113
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,530
Oh, thank God you're here.

114
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,410
- Let herself right in.
- How is she?

115
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:22,770
She's still talking nonsense.

116
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,256
She kept the key.
It's now a necklace.

117
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:25,280
So what?

118
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:26,790
Hey. Miriam. Update. Please.

119
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:29,110
No improvement. She's
practically speaking in tongues.

120
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,170
There's a lot of random words,
strange sounds.

121
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,920
She could be speaking bebop.

122
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,846
On the way here, I remembered
she went to Carnegie Hall

123
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:36,300
last night to see Lenny's show.

124
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:39,130
Well, at least we're finally
getting some information here.

125
00:04:39,330 --> 00:04:41,260
Carnegie Hall.

126
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,970
So, she didn't
just lose her mind

127
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:45,180
and wander out into the snow
because it's pretty.

128
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,770
That was my first theory.

129
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,730
Abe, my God. Your shirt.

130
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,490
It's how it came back
from the cleaners.

131
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,640
Well, put on another shirt.
We have a crisis here.

132
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,650
They all came back like this!

133
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:56,456
Look, I'm gonna go see
what I can find out.

134
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,690
About the shirt?

135
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,550
Because that's not important
right now.

136
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:04,240
Miriam.

137
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,330
It's me, Susie.

138
00:05:06,530 --> 00:05:08,160
Gone, gone.

139
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,710
What's gone?

140
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,080
The window.

141
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,960
- The window's gone?
- Open.

142
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,290
The window's gone open?

143
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:17,000
It's closing.
A door. It's closing.

144
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,420
Nothing's closing.

145
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:20,170
Cheese and crackers.

146
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,590
Tony Bennett.

147
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:22,970
What about him?

148
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:24,510
I slept with him.

149
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,140
You slept with Tony Bennett?

150
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,646
When the fuck
did you meet Tony Bennett?

151
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:29,560
- He went to bat.
- Who?

152
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,310
Get my hat.

153
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,690
Are you trying to rhyme?

154
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:34,890
Mm.

155
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,670
Miriam?

156
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,700
- So, apparently, she had sex with Tony Bennett.
- - What?

157
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:47,420
And she wants
some cheese and crackers.

158
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,130
I brought her
a perfectly good manchego.

159
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,660
- She wouldn't eat it.
- How does she know Tony Bennett?

160
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:53,040
Did she mention a hat?

161
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,710
When doesn't she mention a hat?

162
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,556
And there was something
about a window and a door.

163
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,966
And these are not helping,
by the way.

164
00:05:57,990 --> 00:05:59,350
I thought
they might calm her down.

165
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:01,760
Ugh, Zelda,
what smells like donkey balls?

166
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,590
Special Polish fish head soup.

167
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:06,430
It wards off evil spirits.
Makes your hair shiny, too.

168
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:07,890
Okay. Well, when you are done

169
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:09,686
driving down the neighbors'
property values,

170
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:11,600
make some coffee, strong coffee.

171
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,480
This is gonna take a while.

172
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,850
<i>- Miriam.
- Mm.</i>

173
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,690
Miriam, try to focus.

174
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:19,480
What happened last night?

175
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,320
It was cold. Blizzard.

176
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,610
Yes, blizzards are cold.

177
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,700
Walking, walking.

178
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,046
So, you're walking in the cold.

179
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,990
- Frost crotch.
- What?

180
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:30,620
I got frost crotch.

181
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,250
Frost crotch?
Is that a thing?

182
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,210
My toes.
I'm gonna lose my toes.

183
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:36,886
You know, there's been
a lot of toe talk,

184
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,596
but, frankly, frost crotch
should've been the headline.

185
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,130
I'm sure
your toes are perfect...

186
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,840
Holy shit. Oh.

187
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,010
- Are they bad?
- No.

188
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,890
You put your head
between your knees

189
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:49,390
to keep from passing out, right?

190
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,640
- Susie, tell me.
- Jesus.

191
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,440
What the hell
does your crotch look like?

192
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,560
Oh, good.

193
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,730
Susie?

194
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,740
Susie?
Did you find out anything?

195
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,610
Should we get the doctor back?

196
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,740
Uh, his house call rates
are astronomical,

197
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,700
- so if we can avoid that...
- I saw the toe.

198
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,580
I told you about the toe.

199
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,920
No. No, Rose, you did not
tell me about that toe.

200
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,790
You told me about
a cute little frozen toe,

201
00:07:17,950 --> 00:07:19,340
pink and white like a cherub.

202
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,846
You did not at all prepare me
for the horror show

203
00:07:20,870 --> 00:07:21,990
I just witnessed back there.

204
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:22,960
You're overreacting.

205
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:24,300
It's black.

206
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,220
Her toe is black, Rose.

207
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,430
That's not overreacting.
That thing is a goner.

208
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,350
It's like she was in a war,
an old one.

209
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,450
Never mind.

210
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,410
Okay. I'm going back in.

211
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:42,480
You know, I can't unsee
that toe now, Rose.

212
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,980
You understand that?

213
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:46,740
I may never
fucking close my eyes again.

214
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,200
<i>You feeling a little better?</i>

215
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,620
Yeah, you maybe want to get up?
Move around a little?

216
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:53,336
Hey, your kids are watching TV.
Don't you want to see your kids?

217
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,120
The kids can go fuck themselves.

218
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,040
She just said, "The kids can
go fuck themselves."

219
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,640
- What?
- No, they certainly cannot.

220
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:03,090
Such terrible talk.

221
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:05,016
I have to tell you, I don't
really know how to proceed here.

222
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,880
- You know what would help?
- What?

223
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,570
If you gave that key back.

224
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,490
Well, it certainly
couldn't hurt.

225
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,850
<i>Susie.</i>

226
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,810
Mm?

227
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,350
- Susie.
- What?

228
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:22,730
You're up.
How are you feeling?

229
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:24,610
Okay, I guess.

230
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:27,610
Hey, did I say my kids
can go fuck themselves?

231
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,036
If it makes you feel any better,

232
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,376
I don't think
the little one heard you.

233
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,530
Oh, good.

234
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,660
So, you want to tell me
what happened last night?

235
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:35,620
Uh... not much.

236
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:38,870
I-I was at Carnegie Hall,
there was a blizzard.

237
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:42,000
I couldn't find a cab,
so I just started walking.

238
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,920
Hey, hey, you think you can
get the Bennett gig back?

239
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,120
Oh, I think that's gone.

240
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,130
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

241
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,476
But maybe their second choice
didn't get back to them yet.

242
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:53,030
Their second choice is ironing
his show pants as we speak.

243
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:00,480
Me and my stupid manifesto.

244
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,400
"Make me a headliner.
No opening act for anybody."

245
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,940
What an idiotic thing to say.

246
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,320
It wasn't all idiotic.

247
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,536
The part about being able to say
what you want to say,

248
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,090
that was smart.

249
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,420
Maybe I don't have
what it takes.

250
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,270
Maybe I'm not as tough
as I thought I was.

251
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,450
I mean, look at me,

252
00:09:18,650 --> 00:09:20,960
eight inches of snow,
I've become my mother.

253
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,340
I'm in bed, popping pills,
candles everywhere.

254
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:27,050
Bet I got crystals
under my pillow.

255
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,220
Yep, got crystals
under my pillow.

256
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,720
Three of 'em.

257
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:33,140
No, no, no, no.

258
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:35,510
Come on, think of
something happy, think of shoes.

259
00:09:35,710 --> 00:09:37,720
My toe.
I'm gonna lose a toe.

260
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,360
Okay, don't think of shoes.
No shoes.

261
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:40,810
Think of hats.
You like hats.

262
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:43,270
My hat. I loved that hat.

263
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,150
Listen to me,
tomorrow this will all be

264
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,330
a funny bit
you can use in your act.

265
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,150
I'm so sorry, Susie.

266
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,910
God, I'm so stupid.

267
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:55,490
We had a plan,
then I went rogue.

268
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:57,370
I-I tried to do it all myself.

269
00:09:57,570 --> 00:09:59,040
I shouldn't have done that.

270
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,830
You are the one person
who understands me.

271
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:05,060
You're the person who got me
here, got me anywhere.

272
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:09,880
I promise
I will never stop trusting

273
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:14,280
the most important person
in my life ever again.

274
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,390
- Six months.
- What?

275
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:21,870
I got to break her
in six months.

276
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,100
She's got that face.

277
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:24,900
Harry warned me about that face.

278
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,860
He told me his biggest regret
was not knowing

279
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,730
what that face meant
till it was too late.

280
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,690
They got that face,
they're about to give up.

281
00:10:30,850 --> 00:10:32,530
She's not giving up.
We've come too far.

282
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,036
- And Mike's the key.
- Who's Mike?

283
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,860
I got to go.

284
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,200
Okay. Just one more thing...

285
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:38,260
I'm not giving you
the fucking key, Abe.

286
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:44,926
So, Thanksgiving's coming up
in a few days.

287
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:46,750
What?

288
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:48,500
Tomorrow? Really?

289
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,550
Why am I still in town?

290
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:53,340
Yes, Thanksgiving, folks,
a day of food and family.

291
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,821
A day you sit at a table and
look from your father-in-law,

292
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,180
who still hopes his daughter
will come to her senses...

293
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,640
to your mother-in-law,

294
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,920
who still hopes her daughter
will come to her senses,

295
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:05,440
to your wife, who still hopes
that she'll come to her senses.

296
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:08,826
Your wife came to her senses,
didn't she, George?

297
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,320
Quite a few of them, actually.

298
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:13,190
- Yes.
- Always marry a smart woman.

299
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:15,740
Sooner or later,
she'll leave you.

300
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,370
You know, one of my favorite
Thanksgiving traditions

301
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:20,336
is to sit in my living room
and watch the overinflated

302
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,450
cartoonish figures
of my youth float on...

303
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,370
by outside
without saying a word.

304
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,040
Then when Grandma and Grandpa

305
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,716
are ready to come on inside,
we watch that

306
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:29,100
little thing
that Macy's puts on.

307
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:33,090
Yeah, I love the Macy's
Thanksgiving Day Parade.

308
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:35,010
Although
it really does let you know

309
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,760
your pecking order
in show business.

310
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,470
I mean, the <i>Gordon Ford Show</i> has

311
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,356
the greatest studio audience
in the business,

312
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:41,970
and I do really mean that.

313
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,180
But, folks, I'm sorry,

314
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,856
your enthusiasm just pales
in comparison

315
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,060
to any group of kids

316
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:48,116
when a 12-foot-tall Mighty Mouse
floats overhead.

317
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:50,190
It's like Elvis with a tail
to those kids.

318
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,786
Another tradition
I love about Thanksgiving is

319
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,496
sitting around the table
and Grandma, of course,

320
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,740
will remind you
that this could be her last.

321
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,990
And then we say,
"Grandma, we know, we know,

322
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:02,280
but we're all eating
Aunt Rosie's stuffing,

323
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,200
and none of us are
complaining about it."

324
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,640
Folks, we got a great show
for you tonight. Stick around.

325
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:10,210
- I am not trespassing.
- Oh, no?

326
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:11,730
I am a tourist,
visiting this city

327
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:12,960
for the very first time,

328
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:14,420
and I took a wrong turn.

329
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,590
I was looking for
the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.

330
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:18,010
Classic mix-up.

331
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,430
Look, I'm a manager.
Big, big talent person.

332
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:22,470
What's your name, Willie?
Get ready, Willie.

333
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,230
You and I are gonna
become best friends.

334
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:26,930
- You are gonna speak at my wedding.
- I hate weddings.

335
00:12:27,130 --> 00:12:28,810
Elevator's
your final destination.

336
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,610
NYPD must be kicking themselves
for turning you down, huh?

337
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,800
Hedy, no!

338
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:34,570
And I said,
"That is not an ashtray.

339
00:12:34,770 --> 00:12:38,240
That is a 19th century
French barbotine vase."

340
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:41,280
Oh, you just have to laugh.

341
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,990
Otherwise, the stupidity
of people will make you cry.

342
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:57,420
Zelda,
it smells like it's boiling.

343
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:59,500
- It's not boiling.
- - It's supposed to simmer.

344
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,420
- It's simmering.
- Do you know the difference?

345
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,436
- I know the difference.
- Boiling is rapid bubbles.

346
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,010
Simmer is slow bubbles.

347
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,890
She knows simmering, Shirley.

348
00:13:07,090 --> 00:13:08,890
Salt, Zelda, salt.

349
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:10,980
What is this,
currency back in your country?

350
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,230
Use your fist.

351
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,270
Pushy old broad.

352
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,360
- Cheap goy.
- Fight fair, you two.

353
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,070
- Well, my flowers arrived and they're all dead.
- What?

354
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:21,780
They must have gotten my order
mixed up with someone else's.

355
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,900
- What do we do?
- I guess we won't have flowers.

356
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,330
We can't not have flowers,
Miriam, it's Thanksgiving.

357
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,650
All anyone cares about
at Thanksgiving is the flowers.

358
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,040
I'll figure it out.

359
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,750
He smells the turkey.

360
00:13:31,950 --> 00:13:33,466
He sniffed the air,
I swear he sniffed it.

361
00:13:33,490 --> 00:13:34,670
Rose, look at him sniff.

362
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:36,090
Astrid, I have scissors here.

363
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,550
If you say something, he'll turn
and look right at you.

364
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,350
Try it, Midge. Here, here.
Say something.

365
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,300
Uh, did you know
the day after Thanksgiving is

366
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,226
- the busiest day for plumbers?
- Oh, look! He turned!

367
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,010
- Oh, Shirley, he turned!
- Astrid.

368
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,470
This is a stove.

369
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,060
Never wave a baby over a stove

370
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:51,100
unless you're trying
to potty train him.

371
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,810
Get the baby out.
Get the baby out.

372
00:13:53,010 --> 00:13:54,730
I'll take the baby,
Miss Astrid.

373
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:56,940
He's just so aware.

374
00:13:57,140 --> 00:13:59,230
And awake, you know,
like, he's always awake.

375
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:00,780
You know, never sleeps.

376
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,666
Wait, Shirley, did you just say
you potty train a baby

377
00:14:02,690 --> 00:14:03,950
by dangling them over a stove?

378
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:05,240
It warms their tush,

379
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,956
that reminds them of
what their tush is for.

380
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,830
I got Joely trained
in an hour and a half.

381
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:11,970
How often do you all cry?

382
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,460
Where am I?

383
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,880
Aren't you next to Mom?

384
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:18,920
Oh, actually, I moved
some of the cards around.

385
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,476
I thought it'd be nice
to have the little ones

386
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,660
at the grown-up table so that
Chaim doesn't feel weird.

387
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,970
So, Rose, you're there.
Noah, there.

388
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:26,470
Moishe, Shirley there, there.

389
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:28,646
Abe, Midge, and Joel,
I moved you to the kids' table.

390
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:31,140
- But I'm a grown-up.
- I'll go to the kids' table, Pop.

391
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,906
Oh, no, but it's Chaim's
first Thanksgiving.

392
00:14:32,930 --> 00:14:34,230
You can't abandon him.

393
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,270
Daddy's just being silly.

394
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,900
- Don't be scared.
- Sorry, Pop.

395
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,650
He's asleep. He won't care.

396
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:40,850
I think he will.

397
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,610
Yes, but you aren't
a great thinker.

398
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:43,810
Papa, come sit with us.

399
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:46,740
I brought some extra salt

400
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,450
in case the food is
under-seasoned.

401
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:50,830
Joel, I'd like that seat.

402
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,290
Why?

403
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:54,330
Because I am head of the family.

404
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:57,040
- I should sit at the head of the table.
- The kids' table?

405
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:59,420
How important is winning
this particular battle to you?

406
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:02,090
Oh, boy, who killed the flowers?

407
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:03,290
They came that way.

408
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,930
And you paid for that?

409
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,390
I could have put out
dead flowers for free.

410
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:09,810
- Hey, watch it.
- Sorry.

411
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,390
I would like to propose a toast.

412
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:14,640
- What? From there?
- Yes, from here.

413
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,640
A toast should come
from the grown-ups' table.

414
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,940
- But...
- I'll do the toast.

415
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,270
Oh, you're in luck, Chaim.

416
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,780
Once a year,
we gather together...

417
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:23,536
- Ah! Did you see him point at you?
- Did he point?

418
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,720
- Right at you.
- Do it again.

419
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:25,956
- Point at Daddy.
- Point at Daddy.

420
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,980
Point at Daddy.

421
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,020
To pointing! Let's eat.

422
00:15:29,730 --> 00:15:31,370
Noah, did I tell you
about the trip I won?

423
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,240
Really?

424
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:33,580
- From her bank.
- What?

425
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,210
You won the trip from your bank!

426
00:15:35,410 --> 00:15:37,050
I don't know what you said
way over there,

427
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,250
but I won a trip from my bank
to Palm Beach.

428
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:42,000
The manager called,
out of the blue, to thank me

429
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,260
for my loyalty
and then offered me a trip.

430
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,460
- Fun.
- What?

431
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:46,880
- Fun!
- Whatever.

432
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:48,360
Anyhow,
we're going this weekend.

433
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,470
And the best part is,
our daughter has refused

434
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:54,680
to bring our grandchildren
to the airport to see us off.

435
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:55,980
Very disappointing.

436
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,310
I'm working that day.

437
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,650
- Wait, how come you can hear him?
- What?

438
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,486
We have a little announcement
to make ourselves.

439
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,990
We were saving it
for the proper time.

440
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,156
Shirley, you want to tell 'em?

441
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,206
No, you go ahead, Moishie.

442
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:07,880
Shirley and I are
getting divorced.

443
00:16:09,130 --> 00:16:11,330
Stuffing needs salt.

444
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,700
Wait, what?

445
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,370
No. Why?

446
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:16,376
We just realized
we're not right for each other.

447
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:17,870
Now? Now you realized?

448
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:21,000
Once Moishe almost died,
I assumed he'd retire.

449
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,766
He been talking about retiring
for years.

450
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:24,340
I did,
but once you're close to death,

451
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,630
you realize how short life is.

452
00:16:26,830 --> 00:16:28,590
And I thought, I haven't done
half the things

453
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:31,510
I set out to do in my business,
so I decided to expand.

454
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:33,310
And now we're kaput.

455
00:16:33,500 --> 00:16:34,930
How's the turkey? Need salt?

456
00:16:35,130 --> 00:16:36,640
Oh, the turkey's delicious,
Shirley.

457
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,640
It's Thanksgiving.

458
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,906
We're all sitting down
to dinner,

459
00:16:38,930 --> 00:16:40,090
and you just dump this on us?

460
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:42,020
Relax, Joel, everything's fine.
We're fine.

461
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:44,610
We're still sharing the home
for now. Nothing's changed.

462
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,286
Yeah, we just put a piece
of plexiglass

463
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,320
down the center of the bed
so we don't touch butts,

464
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,450
but you can still see
if the other person is

465
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,650
choking in their sleep.

466
00:16:51,770 --> 00:16:52,780
So there's still love.

467
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,490
Guys, can't you two
work this out?

468
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,910
Really?

469
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:57,510
You're the one asking
that question?

470
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,386
Little Miss "One strike
and your husband's out"?

471
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:00,580
Don't talk to Midge that way.

472
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,290
You and Ma have
to work this out.

473
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,490
Not gonna happen, Joely.

474
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:04,630
We tried. We talked.

475
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:06,230
And then Moishe said
something to me

476
00:17:06,370 --> 00:17:09,680
that I never thought I would
ever hear my husband say,

477
00:17:09,870 --> 00:17:11,470
and he can't unsay it.

478
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,760
And in response
Shirley said something to me

479
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,360
I never thought
another human being,

480
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,680
let alone my wife of 34 years,
would say to me,

481
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,770
and she can't unsay it.

482
00:17:19,970 --> 00:17:21,900
- Well, I'm on Mom's side here.
- What? Why?

483
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:24,330
Why? You had a heart attack,
of course you should retire.

484
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,400
Well, thank you
for your loyalty to the gender.

485
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,280
Very nice.

486
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,360
Hey, since we're all sharing
big life news,

487
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,076
you have something to tell
the people, don't you, Joel?

488
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,910
- Really, Pop?
- An announcement.

489
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:35,706
Something you've been
sitting on way too long.

490
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:36,740
What announcement?

491
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:38,700
Well, uh...

492
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,100
This wasn't exactly when
I was going to tell you, but...

493
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,710
Watch it!

494
00:17:42,910 --> 00:17:44,270
- Ethan, switch with Daddy.
- Okay.

495
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:46,500
Can't believe
I have to... Okay, so,

496
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,630
as my newly single father
just said,

497
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:49,840
I do have some news.

498
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,320
It's about me and my girlfriend.

499
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:53,840
- Hey, watch it.
- Esther, kids' table. Move.

500
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:56,490
- Okay.
- Sorry. Go ahead.

501
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,600
We are gonna get married.

502
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,890
Oh, my God!

503
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:02,600
- Congratulations.
- Oh, my God. Yes.

504
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,600
And we're gonna have a baby.

505
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,810
- Uh, mazel!
- What? Oh, my God!

506
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,400
W-Well, who is this girl,
thi-this fianc e?

507
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:09,600
- You know her.
- I do?

508
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,490
- You met her.
- When?

509
00:18:10,690 --> 00:18:12,166
- You played mah-jongg with her.
- Where?

510
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:13,550
- At the hospital?
- What hospital?

511
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,246
The hospital
when Pop had his heart attack.

512
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:17,370
- Oh. Did I win?
- Yes. You met her,

513
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:18,876
you love her,
we're getting married.

514
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,870
A grandchild.
Rose, did you hear?

515
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,870
How dare you keep this from me?

516
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,580
He kept it from you, not me!

517
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,880
You want me to be miserable,
but I won't.

518
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,380
I'll have a daughter-in-law
and a grandchild,

519
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,010
and you will drop dead

520
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:34,180
in a pile of
the men's spring collection.

521
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,660
What a thing to say
on a holiday.

522
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:39,720
Enjoy the Zen beauty
and relative anonymity

523
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,350
of this table
as long as you can.

524
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,770
<i>I'm starving.</i>

525
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:48,110
Impossible.

526
00:18:48,310 --> 00:18:50,076
I think you ate
the entire turkey by yourself.

527
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,610
- Ha, you ate the turkey by yourself.
- - Did not.

528
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:56,030
<i>- W nsh ng h o,</i> Mrs. Chou.
-<i> W nsh ng h o, </i>Mrs. Chou.

529
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:57,420
Watch out, watch out.

530
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,050
Put that bag in the kitchen,
Ethan.

531
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,870
A lady already lives here.

532
00:19:06,070 --> 00:19:07,180
What?

533
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:10,630
Uh, kids do me a favor,

534
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,520
can you go in Daddy's bedroom
for a minute?

535
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,470
- Take my hand.
- No!

536
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,780
- I'm supposed to show you.
- I know where it is.

537
00:19:18,950 --> 00:19:20,856
Why didn't you tell me
you were coming back today?

538
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,280
I missed you.

539
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,310
I didn't know about the kids.

540
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,820
That you had them.
Today, I mean.

541
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:32,150
It's okay.

542
00:19:36,690 --> 00:19:38,030
You want something to eat?

543
00:19:38,230 --> 00:19:39,496
I have a whole Thanksgiving meal
in the kitchen.

544
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,520
I'm moving to Chicago.

545
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:42,630
Easing into a conversation's

546
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:44,126
really not your strong suit,
is it?

547
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,750
Sorry. How was your Thanks...

548
00:19:45,950 --> 00:19:47,970
- Moment's passed, Mei.
- Right. Sorry.

549
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:50,590
- Sit down.
- No.

550
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:52,300
- You won't sit down?
- No.

551
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,300
I just need to stand here
and say what I came to say.

552
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:58,130
I think my residency is gonna
wind up in Chicago.

553
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,760
I like the hospital
and the people.

554
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,600
Uh-huh. Well, I don't know
if you noticed,

555
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:02,930
but I don't live in Chicago,

556
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:04,450
and I can't really move
right now.

557
00:20:04,510 --> 00:20:05,930
- I know.
- There's no hospital

558
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:07,196
in the entire Northeast
that could work?

559
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:07,980
- No.
- You've looked?

560
00:20:08,180 --> 00:20:09,180
- No.
- Should you?

561
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,750
Because we're having a baby.

562
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,040
No.

563
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,130
No?

564
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,250
We're not...

565
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,800
anymore.

566
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,830
What happened?

567
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:24,670
Are you all right?
Why didn't you call me?

568
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,046
I would have been
on the next train to...

569
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:27,540
Nothing happened. I just...

570
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:30,560
We're...

571
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:34,750
just not having
a baby anymore.

572
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:37,190
I don't understand.

573
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,240
Oh, shit. I understand.

574
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:44,970
I'm sorry.

575
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:46,310
I'm gonna sit down.

576
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,450
All my life I've had one goal.

577
00:20:49,490 --> 00:20:51,310
You knew
I never intended to have

578
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,150
a serious relationship
with anyone,

579
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:55,780
and this thing with you was...

580
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,780
Daddy!
Esther's pointing at me again!

581
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:01,620
- I'll be there in a minute!
- Daddy, she won't stop!

582
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:03,930
In a minute, Ethan!
Goddamn it!

583
00:21:05,050 --> 00:21:08,000
Shit. Sorry, Ethan!

584
00:21:08,200 --> 00:21:09,920
- I know you're upset.
- I don't understand.

585
00:21:10,030 --> 00:21:11,926
If you were gonna do this,
why the hell did you tell me

586
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:13,840
you were pregnant
in the first place?

587
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,636
I mean, since I don't matter
in the equation.

588
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,840
- That's not true.
- Can Jews be monks?

589
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,300
'Cause my fucking
relationship track record...

590
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,430
I know I should have
thought it through better.

591
00:21:22,630 --> 00:21:25,930
But I didn't, because you are...

592
00:21:26,130 --> 00:21:28,310
You're you.

593
00:21:28,510 --> 00:21:30,310
I never saw you coming.

594
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,776
You should be
an optometrist, then.

595
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,150
Might help with that eyesight.

596
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,110
Don't be sarcastic, please.

597
00:21:35,310 --> 00:21:36,910
Okay. Don't be upset,
don't be sarcastic,

598
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,360
- don't give a shit.
- I didn't say that. I just...

599
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:44,760
I can't have it all, Joel.

600
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:49,080
The world doesn't work that way.

601
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:53,560
If I'm really gonna be a doctor,
then I just have to be a doctor.

602
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:57,810
Please understand.

603
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,730
I really need you to understand.

604
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,700
Okay.

605
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,770
Okay, fuck it. Fine.
I understand.

606
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:11,980
I do. You're gonna be
a terrific doctor.

607
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,600
- Thank you.
- You got all your stuff?

608
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,400
You must've left
some things here.

609
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:17,860
Oh, just this sweater.

610
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:19,730
One sweater.

611
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:21,860
Boy, I'm really not
very observant, am I?

612
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:23,530
Girl leaves nothing
but a sweater,

613
00:22:23,730 --> 00:22:25,666
- that's a pretty big fucking sign.
- Please, Joel, I...

614
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:28,090
I got the kids, Mei.

615
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:32,350
I really do wish you luck.

616
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:41,510
I'll send you my new address.

617
00:22:41,710 --> 00:22:42,980
Sure. Send the address.

618
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,220
- Bye, Joel.
- Bye.

619
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,660
You're a turkey leg.

620
00:22:54,910 --> 00:22:56,560
You're a turkey leg.

621
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:58,230
You're two turkey legs.

622
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:01,780
Turkey leg, turkey leg,
turkey leg.

623
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:03,990
Esther, you keep pointing
that finger at Ethan,

624
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:06,450
he's gonna eat it.

625
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:09,280
♪ <i>Hit the road Jack, and don't</i>
<i>you come back no more...</i> ♪

626
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:12,290
Excuse me, Miss?
Uh, this turkey is very dry.

627
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:14,250
That's food that
someone brought from home.

628
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:15,580
I can't help you.

629
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,830
Uh, excuse me, Miss?
More Chianti?

630
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:19,840
That's wine that
someone brought from home.

631
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:21,460
Jesus Christ.

632
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,386
I'll be leading the whole room
in saying grace.

633
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:25,186
You got to say grace
at Thanksgiving, so be ready.

634
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,260
- I don't know grace.
- I do. Great ass.

635
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:29,390
He got you.

636
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:31,150
Get it all out now.
You got two minutes.

637
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,740
Susie, be in charge
of this section.

638
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,696
We all say grace together
in just over two minutes.

639
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:35,850
Sounds fun.

640
00:23:36,050 --> 00:23:37,770
I just don't know
if I'm ready to tour.

641
00:23:37,970 --> 00:23:39,986
It's not a tour. It's a two-week
stint at the Hacienda.

642
00:23:40,010 --> 00:23:41,270
The audience comes to you.

643
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,320
- Sounds intimidating.
- It's not.

644
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,530
You do the show,
then you go back to your room.

645
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,240
I got you a really nice suite,
with maid service.

646
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,480
You ever have maid service?
A girl cleans your room,

647
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:52,370
makes your bed.
Hell, it's Vegas,

648
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:54,466
- she'll probably give you a tug if you ask for it.
- A what?

649
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,790
I even got you
a first-class plane ticket.

650
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,500
Plane ticket? I can't fly.

651
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:00,380
No, the plane flies,
you just sit in it.

652
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,210
I can't go on a plane.
They make no sense.

653
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:04,590
I mean, what keeps them up?

654
00:24:04,790 --> 00:24:06,016
I don't know,
what keeps a bird up?

655
00:24:06,040 --> 00:24:07,640
- Worries about money?
- Was that a joke?

656
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:09,590
You set me up,
but I'm not flying.

657
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,510
Oh, yes, you are.
You'll be fine.

658
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,430
You're coming, too, right?

659
00:24:13,630 --> 00:24:16,060
Me? Are you kidding? I'm not
getting on a fucking plane.

660
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,560
Ow! Shit.

661
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,860
I think
I just fucked up my tooth.

662
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:23,320
Which one of you losers
brought these rolls?

663
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,150
I did.
Made 'em myself. You like?

664
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:29,110
- No. They're hard as rocks.
- Oh, that's on purpose.

665
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:31,870
It's an old family recipe.
We call 'em Hard Rock Rolls.

666
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:33,626
Well, that is the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

667
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:35,046
You know, you're supposed
to soak 'em in hot water

668
00:24:35,070 --> 00:24:36,376
for ten minutes
before biting into 'em.

669
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,460
Did you not know that?

670
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:38,670
No, I did not know that.

671
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,080
Everyone, an announcement!

672
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,250
The Stage Deli is
not responsible

673
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:45,130
for Grandma's sawdust turkey,
Grandpa's lumpy potatoes,

674
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:47,220
Aunt Betty's
sour cranberry sauce,

675
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:49,340
or the raisins
in the goddamn carrot cake.

676
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,180
So stop asking.

677
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:54,350
- You're dismissed, Fred.
- Okay. Enjoy your evening.

678
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:57,560
- Hey, Verla, can we get some more hot water for these rolls?
- No!

679
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,600
Wow, looks like
there's already plenty of food.

680
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,400
- Hi, Alfie.
- Are you limping?

681
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,060
Yeah, I almost lost a toe.

682
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:06,030
Hey, look at my tooth,
does it look weird?

683
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:08,110
You have spinach in it,
or something.

684
00:25:08,310 --> 00:25:09,740
Oh! It's moving.

685
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,570
It's the goddamn
Hard Rock Rolls.

686
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:13,700
Fred's rolls? You're supposed
to soak 'em first.

687
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,450
Never mind all that.
Listen.

688
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,410
I kissed Bobby's ass,
and I finally got you

689
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:19,830
a slot at that club on 15th,
next Thursday.

690
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:22,210
- Great. I'm ready.
- And Boise called.

691
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:24,006
I can't understand you
with your finger in your mouth.

692
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:25,500
Boise called.

693
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:27,476
They paid off the right cops
so the Wolford's reopening.

694
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,100
They still want you,
if you're into that.

695
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:31,186
If you're okay with it, I am.
I've got clean stuff,

696
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:32,850
dirty stuff,
I need a place to stay sharp.

697
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,680
Okay, everyone,
there will be no group grace

698
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:36,600
due to an utter lack
of interest in doing it

699
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,070
and an endless
string of jokes about

700
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:39,520
what to do
with the turkey neck.

701
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:41,280
So, enjoy your food,
happy Thanksgiving.

702
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,060
- I'm not flying.
- Yes, you are.

703
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,440
- I am ready to go, too.
- I'm not flying.

704
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:48,280
Yes, you are. I got
a lot of irons in the fire.

705
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,320
- I'm not flying.
- Yes, you are.

706
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,110

- What are you doing here?
- I'm looking for a tree.

727
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:50,980

- I just thought we could talk.

728

- You thought...
- - <i>Cocoa with marshmallows, now available...</i>

729
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,970
I'm here with my kids.

730
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:56,316
They're running around here
somewhere.

731
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:57,640
I'm sorry, you forced my hand.

732
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,930
I... what?

733
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,606
I wanted to talk to you
at the studio...

734
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:03,270
but suddenly
I can't get through security.

735
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,906
You can't get through security
'cause I gave them your picture

736
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:06,270
and said,
"Under no circumstances

737
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,406
- do you let this person in."
- Well, was it flattering?

738
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:10,110
The photo? Backlit,
little shoulder action?

739
00:27:10,310 --> 00:27:12,070
- I'm holding a saw.
- I have to talk to you.

740
00:27:12,270 --> 00:27:13,456
- Yeah.
- I want you to give my girl

741
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:15,240
Miriam Maisel another look-see.

742
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:17,760
Just come and see her do her
thing, you will not regret it.

743
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,876
Oh, I already offered to see her
do her thing, remember?

744
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,950
You flipped out, cursed me,
and stomped off

745
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,000
to the enchanted bog
you slithered out of.

746
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,540
- Well, let's set something up again.
- No.

747
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,840
I don't offer again.

748
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:30,460
I will not see your girl.

749
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:31,926
Fine, you don't have to see her.

750
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,110
Send someone from the office.

751
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,360
Uh, one of your women writers.

752
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,840
We don't have any women writers.

753
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:38,390
Oh, so Gordon Ford's just
one big cock parade, huh?

754
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:39,830
What's going on with your mouth?

755
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,430
It's my tooth.
Don't worry about it.

756
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:43,446
- Want me to saw it out of your head?
- No, thanks.

757
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:44,480
Go away.

758
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,310
Hey, I am being nice here.

759
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,850
I'm sorry, what?

760
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,736
I came all the way up here
to make it convenient for you,

761
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,230
and now you're brushing me off?

762
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:53,280
Where's a pack of wolves
when you need one?

763
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,320
Hey, who brought you
Sophie Lennon, huh?

764
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,530
I did,
and that interview worked.

765
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,660
It was huge. It single-handedly
drove your ratings up.

766
00:28:00,860 --> 00:28:02,376
And you're strutting
around that studio,

767
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,410
taking all the credit.

768
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:04,910
I did that for you, Mikey.

769
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:06,370
You know something?

770
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:09,210
There is one thing that
I look forward to all year long,

771
00:28:09,410 --> 00:28:12,550
one thing that brings me pure
happiness, and it's this.

772
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,590
Christmas tree hunting
with my kids.

773
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:17,590
We do it every year,
and it's a fucking joy!

774
00:28:17,790 --> 00:28:21,470
Now you are going to stay!
Right there!

775
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:24,600
And I'm gonna go buy cider
for my kids

776
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,580
and forget
that you ever happened.

777
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:29,850
Oh, I already bought them
some cider.

778
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:32,480
Wanted to keep 'em occupied.

779
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,840
You know, it's weird, none
of 'em really look like you.

780
00:28:36,130 --> 00:28:38,920
I'm giving this place
your picture next year.

785
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,240
Maybe.

786
00:28:55,290 --> 00:28:56,550
<i>Spartacus?</i>

787
00:28:56,750 --> 00:28:58,760
- Was it <i>Spartacus?</i>
- Maybe.

788
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,470
The three-hour movie
with all the crucifixions?

789
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,550
That was the movie
you thought would be great

790
00:29:03,750 --> 00:29:05,030
for three kids under ten to see?

791
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:06,276
I thought
they'd like the horses.

792
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:07,340
So you've ruined Christmas

793
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,420
and crucifixions for me.

794
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,480
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

795
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,810
And because of you,

796
00:29:13,010 --> 00:29:14,980
I picked
the worst tree on the lot.

797
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:17,240
You got in my head
and you blew my focus.

798
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:20,740
- Mike, I just...
- You will never set foot in 30 Rock again.

799
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,410
Do you understand?

800
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:25,200
You won't even be allowed
to stand in front of 30 Rock.

801
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,680
You're gonna make it to 20 Rock,

802
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:28,750
and then
you're gonna have to turn right.

803
00:29:28,950 --> 00:29:31,500
You even won't be allowed
to walk down 5th Avenue.

804
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,420
You won't be able to stand
in front of Saks,

805
00:29:33,490 --> 00:29:36,340
because it is across the street
from 30 Rock on 5th Avenue.

806
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,170
If you want to go to Saks,

807
00:29:38,370 --> 00:29:40,930
you're gonna have to enter
from the 49th Street side.

808
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,146
- I don't go to Saks.
- In fact, stay out of Midtown.

809
00:29:43,170 --> 00:29:44,370
You're not allowed in Midtown.

810
00:29:44,420 --> 00:29:45,560
My office is in Midtown.

811
00:29:45,750 --> 00:29:46,750
Move your office,

812
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,160
and that goes for your girl,
too.

813
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,300
She doesn't have an office.

814
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,560
She will never set foot

815
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,020
in that building either.

816
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,190
And I'm betting
that she does go to Saks,

817
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:57,400
so that 49th Street entrance
is going to fucking kill her.

818
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,950
It is miles away
from the fucking elevators.

819
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,950
Hey, kids, isn't
that Santa Claus over there?

820
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,830
- Where? Where?
- Where's Santa Claus?

821
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:07,660
Oops, made a mistake.

822
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:10,410
I don't think that
that was Santa after all.

<i>There's a ticket to Vegas</i>

832

833
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:35,060
- So how's your tooth?
<i>- Shut up.</i>

834
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:36,810

understand you, right?

837
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:41,570
Fuck me.

838
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:43,110
You have to go to a dentist.

839
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:44,660
I have to get this asshole...

840
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:46,490

841
00:30:46,690 --> 00:30:47,700
I'm not going.

842
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,040
Yes, you are. Ow.

843
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:50,620
No. I'm not going.

844
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,426
<i>- I'm not going. I'm not going...
- You are going. Ow!</i>

845
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:54,080
<i>You are going,
if I have to tie you</i>

846
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:55,506
- to a fucking... ow.
- I'm not going.

847
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:56,960
I'm gonna kill myself.

848
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,420
Susie, this is ridiculous.

849
00:30:58,620 --> 00:30:59,940
I am calling
my dentist right now.

850
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,260
You are heading right over.

851
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,840
<i>But Alfie...</i>

852
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,510
Alfie is not going!

853
00:31:04,710 --> 00:31:05,990
I will take Alfie
to the airport.

854
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,220
<i>- You will?
- Will what?</i>

855
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:08,420
Yes.

856
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:10,390
Okay, but you can't just
drop him off curbside.

857
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,180
You got to see him
walk on the plane.

858
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:14,060
And don't let him
go to the bathroom

859
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:16,196
'cause he will climb out
a window or flush himself

860
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:17,980
- down the toilet. He's slippery.
-<i> I promise.</i>

861
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,480
I am calling the dentist.

862
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,280

I have your cape,
and I'm not giving it back

886
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:20,000
until you step onto that plane.

887
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:22,590
You know, you're being
very silly. Flying is fun.

888
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:24,710
They bring you
drinks and food...

889
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,420
Oh, good. A last meal.

890
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:32,220
Here. It's from Susie.

891
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,890
It's used.

892
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:35,850
It's from Ethan.

893
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,980
So, I got a phone call
the other day,

894
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,400
which was surprising, since
I didn't know I had a phone.

895
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,900
It was from a man...

896
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,260
a talent manager.

897
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:54,760
And what did he want?

898
00:32:56,010 --> 00:32:58,000
He said he'd seen
one of my shows.

899
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,290
He said he thought
I was very talented

900
00:33:00,490 --> 00:33:02,846
and that I could be bigger than
Houdini, which is ridiculous.

901
00:33:02,870 --> 00:33:04,550
I'm already bigger than Houdini.

902
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,090
Houdini was a very tiny man.

903
00:33:06,290 --> 00:33:07,730
That's why he fit
so easily in a box.

904
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:09,880
Did you tell him
you already have a manager?

905
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,430
I did.

906
00:33:11,630 --> 00:33:13,100
He said he knew Susie Myerson

907
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,890
and that she was
an elevator operator.

908
00:33:16,090 --> 00:33:17,430
A what?

909
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,730
Someone you meet
going up or going down.

910
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:21,770
He said
if you want to be on top,

911
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,560
you have to get off
the elevator.

912
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,400
At the top, presumably.

913
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,320
Alfie, do you know why
you're getting on this plane?

914
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:29,650
Because you stole my cape.

915
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:33,570
Because you are about to
play a 2,000-seat room in Vegas.

916
00:33:33,770 --> 00:33:35,660
You have top billing,

917
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,620
amazing accommodations,
and you are making

918
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,426
more money than you've
ever seen in your life.

919
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,370
That's not true.
I slept in a safe once.

920
00:33:41,570 --> 00:33:44,130
Six months ago, you were
hustling drunks in a bar.

921
00:33:44,330 --> 00:33:46,050
You were done.

922
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,630
No one cared
what happened to you.

923
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,840
No one except Susie Myerson.

924
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:51,650
I know that.

925
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,050
It's easy to see a diamond

926
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:56,100
once it's in the window
at Tiffany's.

927
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,020
It's a little harder
when it's throwing up

928
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,160
in a bucket in your office.

929
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,520
Susie is one of a kind.

930
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,900
You'll never find another Susie.

931
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:08,320
You just remember that.

932
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:16,160
Yeah, so that's Gate 4, right?

933
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:17,910
Hi there.
This is Alfie Zielinski.

934
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,870
He's on the 2:45 to Las Vegas.

935
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:21,160
All right, wonderful.

936
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:22,600
It's his first time on a plane,

937
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,830
and he's a little nervous.

938
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,330
I see that noted here.

939
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,590
Don't you worry,
we'll take good care of him.

940
00:34:27,790 --> 00:34:30,130
Hello, Alfie, welcome to TWA.

941
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:32,050
We're going to be great friends.

942
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:33,590
Hey!

943
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:35,686
It's a little sign that
tells everyone who you are.

944
00:34:35,710 --> 00:34:37,890
I won't have to explain a thing.

945
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,850
Call Susie when you land.
Have a great run.

946
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:42,450
And remember
what we talked about, hmm?

947
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:47,230
<i>Welcome
to the TWA Flight Center.</i>

948
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:48,610
Alfie, wait!

949
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:49,860
I have your cape.

950
00:34:50,060 --> 00:34:51,880
Oh, I got it back an hour ago.

951
00:34:57,010 --> 00:34:59,586
- Right down this way.
- Come on, honey, hurry! Don't lock the gate!

952
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:00,700
Miriam?

953
00:35:02,110 --> 00:35:03,410
What are you doing here?

954
00:35:03,610 --> 00:35:05,670
Oh, hi. I'm doing

955
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,966
a last-minute favor for Susie.
There was an emergency.

956
00:35:07,990 --> 00:35:10,210
Oh, so for Susie
she could come out here.

957
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:12,260
For her parents, bubkes.

958
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:13,976
I'll admit it doesn't
look good, Miriam.

959
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:15,356
Susie has a client
who's going to Vegas.

960
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,890
She needed someone
to see him off.

961
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:18,760
I have yet
to hear anything remotely

962
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,390
resembling an emergency.

963
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,430
- Her tooth hurt.
- Should we give you a moment

964
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,980
to come up with a better story?

965
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,276
Why aren't you
on a plane right now?

966
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,650
They canceled our flight.

967
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:28,980
No, Rose.
They did not cancel our flight.

968
00:35:29,180 --> 00:35:30,610
The flight is happening.

969
00:35:30,810 --> 00:35:32,730
- They canceled us.
- What are you talking about?

970
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:34,786
They couldn't find our
reservations, and nothing else

971
00:35:34,810 --> 00:35:37,200
was available,
so now we're going home.

972
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,840
We'll be there when you're done
with your very important favor

973
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:41,580
for the friend with a sore tooth

974
00:35:41,780 --> 00:35:43,260
who did not put you
through Bryn Mawr.

975
00:35:43,450 --> 00:35:44,830
Hey, why don't we share
a cab home?

976
00:35:45,030 --> 00:35:46,500
- No.
- Hmm?

977
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,880
We came alone,
we'll go home alone.

978
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,340
Much like birth and death.

979
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:54,300
Okay. I'll wave to you
as I drive alongside

980
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,800
all the way back home.

981
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,470
You know,
we seem to be experiencing

982
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,390
a streak of very bad luck.

983
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,810
I don't know about that.

984
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:04,600
The dry cleaning, the dead
flowers at Thanksgiving,

985
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:07,020
I had two flat tires this week.

986
00:36:07,220 --> 00:36:10,250
Now suddenly
our plane reservations.

987
00:36:11,250 --> 00:36:13,110
What is it? What's the matter?

988
00:36:13,310 --> 00:36:15,280
Rose?

989
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,610
Nothing. Let's just go home.

990
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:19,450
All right.

991
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:21,930
Let's beat Miriam to the taxis.

992
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,700
<i>Yes, I know</i>

993
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,160
the flight was canceled.

994
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:29,386
What I'm just trying to figure
out is how it happened.

995
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:32,380
Was the woman who canceled
by any chance Italian,

996
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:34,460
very intimidating?

997
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:37,170
Or was it an Irish woman
with a very thick Irish accent?

998
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:39,550
You know, "That's
a lovely hat by the way."

999
00:36:39,750 --> 00:36:41,680
Yes, that's an Irish accent.

1000
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,810
I'm not an impressionist,
forgive me.

1001
00:36:44,010 --> 00:36:46,230
Rose! I got a taxi!
Let's go!

1002
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,640
One minute!
Well, could you hear anything

1003
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:51,480
in the background then,
like screams, perhaps?

1004
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,730
Hacksaws or bones breaking?

1005
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:55,400
Rose! Come on!

1006
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:56,690
I'm not joking.

1007
00:36:56,890 --> 00:36:59,240
Rose Weissman,
I'm leaving without you!

1008
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,160
I have to go.
My husband's having a fit.

1009
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,780
Abe, for God's sake!

1010
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:04,370
We lost the cab.

1011
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:05,830
There'll be another cab.

1012
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,830
Like there was another flight?!

1013
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,630
<i>Now arriving
at Gate 10, Flight 192</i>

1014
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,470
<i>from Los Angeles.</i>

1015
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,300
<i>Now arriving at Gate 10,</i>

<i>Flight 192 from Los Angeles.</i>

1017
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,470
- Hello.
- Hello.

1018
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:50,920
First time traveling?

1019
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:53,210
And carrying things, yes.

1020
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:55,350
Can I, uh...?

1021
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:05,140
Rothstein, Myers,
Friedman and Yabromowitz.

1022
00:38:05,340 --> 00:38:06,970
Your rabbis?

1023
00:38:07,170 --> 00:38:08,600
My lawyers.

1024
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,270
Ah.

1025
00:38:10,470 --> 00:38:12,270
Well, you don't want
to lose this.

1026
00:38:12,470 --> 00:38:13,690
No.

1027
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:15,310
They charge by the word.

1028
00:38:15,510 --> 00:38:17,460
- Mm.
- Double for the bad ones.

1029
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:24,630
So, you're taking a trip?

1030
00:38:26,050 --> 00:38:27,950
I am West Coast bound, yes.

1031
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:29,910
- Really?
- Yes.

1032
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:33,000
Gonna see what
an L.A. holding cell is like.

1033
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,630
I hear 72 and sunny.

1034
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:36,350
No humidity.

1035
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:38,710
How have you been?

1036
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:40,840
Good. Really good.

1037
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:42,820
Good.

1038
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,720
Are you off somewhere?

1039
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:49,890
No. I just forced
a very nervous magician

1040
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:52,100
to get on a plane
by holding his cape hostage.

1041
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,690
I did that last week.

1042
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:55,770
The bastard left rabbits
all over my apartment.

1043
00:38:55,970 --> 00:38:57,910
Mm.

1044
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:01,280
So, how long are you gonna be
out west?

1045
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:03,030
Don't know.

1046
00:39:03,230 --> 00:39:04,530
I've got some gigs lined up.

1047
00:39:04,730 --> 00:39:06,070
I rented a house.

1048
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:07,990
Wow.

1049
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:10,120
You're a man with a lease.

1050
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,010
It happens to the best of us.

1051
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,500
Well... I...

1052
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,920
think you'll really enjoy L.A.

1053
00:39:20,120 --> 00:39:22,800
With all the... sun and...

1054
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,800
oranges and Disneyland.

1055
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:27,000
- All the things you love.
- Oh, I'm sure I'll find

1056
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:29,150
a cloud or two to hide under.

1057
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:35,520
My kid's gonna come stay
with me for a while.

1058
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:37,690
Lucky girl.

1059
00:39:37,890 --> 00:39:40,290
Yes.

1060
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:44,530
Well, I should probably go

1061
00:39:44,730 --> 00:39:46,710
find a plane heading west.

1062
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,700
I'm sorry I didn't call.

1063
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,410
Oh, no. We don't do that, right?

1064
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:55,370
Okay.

1065
00:39:55,570 --> 00:39:57,970
You take care.

1066
00:40:00,770 --> 00:40:02,770
Lenny!

1067
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,610
I'm not gonna blow it.

1068
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:19,120
I'm gonna hold you to that.

1069
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:23,480

- Nothing.

And he locked
the cash up in his desk.

1086
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,660
I'm using my mad money

1087

1088

Oh! Finally!

1089
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,460
Archibald!
My faithful companion.

1090
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,250
Okay, so Archibald
is not my name.

1091
00:41:25,450 --> 00:41:27,510
Sure, it is. Archibald,
short for Archie.

1092
00:41:27,710 --> 00:41:29,550
No. Archie would be
short for Archibald.

1093
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:32,090
Like I said, Archibald,
my faithful companion!

1094
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,050
Hey, we should get some horses.

1095
00:41:34,250 --> 00:41:36,220
- Uh...
- Get some boots and chaps.

1096
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:37,720
Ride out into the sunset.

1097
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,390
- Catch us some varmints.
- Yes.

1098
00:41:39,590 --> 00:41:41,350
Something to consider.
Not the chaps,

1099
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:43,656
but the rest we can talk about.
Hey, where have you been?

1100
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,150
I just stopped off at a bar.

1101
00:41:45,350 --> 00:41:47,270
You own a bar. Why are you
stopping off at a bar?

1102
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:49,150
Variety is the spice of life.

1103
00:41:49,350 --> 00:41:50,900
Allow me, pal.

1104
00:41:51,100 --> 00:41:53,050
How are you tonight, beautiful?

1105
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,870
Thank you.

1106
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,676
Absolutely. So what do you
think of the place?

1107
00:41:58,700 --> 00:42:01,330
I'm the owner, so, any problems,
you just come to me.

1108
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:03,130
Excuse me, we were having
a conversation.

1109
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:04,710
In here? No.

1110
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:06,750
You want to talk,
you go to a quiet restaurant.

1111
00:42:06,870 --> 00:42:08,460
Take a walk on the beach.

1112
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,880
You come here to drink, dance,

1113
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,970
to get close enough
to smell her perfume.

1114
00:42:13,170 --> 00:42:14,430
- Hey!
- Joel!

1115
00:42:14,630 --> 00:42:16,106
There's a terrible
martini olive problem

1116
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:17,560
that needs
your immediate attention.

1117
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,026
The place falls apart
without me.

1118
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:20,050
I'll be right back.

1119
00:42:20,170 --> 00:42:22,310

You see a man is up here
trying to talk?

1125
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:37,200
Fucking musicians.

1126
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,330
Hello, everyone.

1127
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:42,330
My name is Joel Maisel,
the owner of the Button Club.

1128
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:46,636
You know, the great thing
about owning a club is that

1129
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:48,216
all the things
that made you look like a loser

1130
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,590
before are now
part of your job.

1131
00:42:50,790 --> 00:42:53,090
For example,
right now I'm not drunk,

1132
00:42:53,290 --> 00:42:55,010
I am doing research.

1133
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:56,850
And I am a very hard worker.

1134
00:42:58,630 --> 00:43:00,060
Hey, I got a laugh.

1135
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,140
See?
We don't need this shitty band.

1136
00:43:02,340 --> 00:43:03,730
No way, pal.

1137
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:06,730
I used to want to do this
for a living. Comedy?

1138
00:43:06,930 --> 00:43:09,860
Oh, yes. But, turns out,

1139
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:12,280
my ex-wife is the one
who had the talent for comedy.

1140
00:43:14,060 --> 00:43:16,450
Ah, you know her.
Yes. She is very funny.

1141
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:18,280
First time I saw her onstage,

1142
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,560
she spent ten minutes
talking about my jockey shorts.

1143
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:23,216
That's ten minutes more
than she ever

1144
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,620
spent washing my jockey shorts.

1145
00:43:24,820 --> 00:43:26,500
And I will admit, as a man

1146
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,096
it was a little hard
listening to your wife

1147
00:43:28,120 --> 00:43:29,170
talk about you onstage.

1148
00:43:29,370 --> 00:43:31,210
But now that I'm up here,

1149
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:33,590
I'm thinking turnabout
is fair play.

1150
00:43:33,790 --> 00:43:34,790
Right?

1151
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:37,930
Okay, well...

1152
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,720
My wife has great tits.

1153
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,310
Really stellar. Right, Archie?

1154
00:43:45,510 --> 00:43:46,940
Never seen 'em. Wouldn't know.

1155
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:49,150
He's shy.
His wife has good tits, too.

1156
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:50,650
Not like mine, though.

1157
00:43:50,850 --> 00:43:53,150
My wife has
Olympic gold medal tits.

1158
00:43:53,350 --> 00:43:54,990
Who else's wife has great tits?

1159
00:43:55,190 --> 00:43:56,430
All right, buddy, that's enough!

1160
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:57,520
Come on, get off the stage.

1161
00:43:57,650 --> 00:43:59,160
Raise your hand there, man.

1162
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,030
Your wife's look pretty good.

1163
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:03,250
Unless that's not
your wife, in which case...

1164
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:05,580
What are you doing later,
gorgeous?

1165
00:44:06,910 --> 00:44:09,210
Okay, everybody!
The bar is open.

1166
00:44:09,410 --> 00:44:10,960
And next round's on me.

1167
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:14,460
Seriously, Joel,
get off the stage.

1168
00:44:14,660 --> 00:44:16,300
I'm just joking around.

1169
00:44:16,500 --> 00:44:18,140
Fucking joking.

1170
00:44:18,330 --> 00:44:20,390
Fine. Whatever.

1171
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:22,390
Hey, how about some tunes?

1172
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:24,270
He just called us shitty, man.

1173
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:25,930
Hey, tell us a joke!

1174
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,500
Hey.

1175
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:37,960
Hey!

1176
00:44:39,170 --> 00:44:41,410
You.

1177
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:43,550
You did this, didn't you?

1178
00:44:45,010 --> 00:44:47,460
You couldn't just
let us figure it out?

1179
00:44:47,660 --> 00:44:49,830
She still would have been
a fucking doctor.

1180
00:44:50,030 --> 00:44:52,730
How many goddamn times
do I have to say this?!

1181
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,400
Say something! I'm right here!

1182
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:18,460
Go back upstairs.

1183
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,630
Hey, there you are.
How'd it go with the dentist?

1184
00:45:37,830 --> 00:45:39,936
Mm, yeah. It went great.
Very thorough guy, terrific guy.

1185
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,550
She's a woman.

1186
00:45:41,750 --> 00:45:43,180
Well, the deep voice fooled me.

1187
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:44,600
You didn't go, did you?

1188
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,600
Nope, I'm cured. Amazing, right?

1189
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,526
I'll deal with it later.
How's the night going?

1190
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:50,560
- Great.
- Oops. What happened?

1191
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,270
I'm so rusty, Susie.

1192
00:45:52,470 --> 00:45:54,110
Last set, I was grasping
for a punch line,

1193
00:45:54,220 --> 00:45:55,696
and I rhymed "mittens"
with "tittens."

1194
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:56,900
What's "tittens"?

1195
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:59,100
Beats the fuck out of me.
But I said it really loud

1196
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:01,070
and smiley like it was
supposed to be hilarious.

1197
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:02,860
It was not hilarious.

1198
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:05,166
Don't sweat it, this is where
you work out your rustiness.

1199
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:07,580
Go ahead, suck. We'll get
a drink after, compare notes.

1200
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:09,410
Okay.

1201
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,550
Hey, can I get some ice?

1202
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:27,180
- For what?
- You want to read my diary, too?

1203
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,780
Shit. Is that Gordon Ford?

1204
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:49,870
- Where?
- There! Follow my hand.

1205
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:51,200
Yeah, that's him.

1206
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:52,926
Boy, he's much better
looking in person.

1207
00:46:52,950 --> 00:46:54,620
Fuck. Fuck.

1208
00:46:54,820 --> 00:46:56,710
What do I do? Should I go
tell Midge he's here?

1209
00:46:56,910 --> 00:46:58,710
No. That will fuck
with her head, right?

1210
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:01,880
Or will it light
a fire under her ass?

1211
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:05,340
Fuck. I don't know.
Protect her head or her ass?!

1212
00:47:05,540 --> 00:47:07,970
Jesus Christ,
I told her to suck.

1213
00:47:08,170 --> 00:47:10,560
Maybe a little nudge is good.

1214
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:13,020
Right?
Okay, I got to think like Midge.

1215
00:47:13,220 --> 00:47:15,900
What would she want?
I don't know.

1216
00:47:16,100 --> 00:47:18,440
Shit. Shit. Fuck. Cock.
Why are the lights changing?

1217
00:47:18,640 --> 00:47:20,570
- Am I having a stroke?
- The number's done.

1218
00:47:20,770 --> 00:47:22,530
Oh, it's done.
The universe decided.

1219
00:47:22,730 --> 00:47:25,200
Bring me a Scotch
with a whiskey in it, okay?

1220
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:27,280
What the fuck are you
standing there for?

1221
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:29,660
Oh. I just get really
amped up, you know?

1222
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,880
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1223
00:47:38,080 --> 00:47:40,670
It's nice to be here.

1224
00:47:40,870 --> 00:47:43,130
So...

1225
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:45,720
I am just really full

1226
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:48,640
from Thanksgiving still.

1227
00:47:48,840 --> 00:47:50,640
Which is not a joke.

1228
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,120
It's more of a disclaimer.

1229
00:47:54,700 --> 00:47:58,230
My son, he likes these
weird leftover combinations,

1230
00:47:58,430 --> 00:48:00,230
like, like turkey and gravy

1231
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:02,570
between two pieces of pecan pie.

1232
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:05,150
It tastes...

1233
00:48:05,350 --> 00:48:07,340
bad.

1234
00:48:10,260 --> 00:48:12,620
Does anyone know
if it's gonna rain tomorrow?

1235
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:15,250
Don't say tittens,
don't say tittens.

1236
00:48:15,450 --> 00:48:16,960
Wow, that was
a really bad start.

1237
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,290
I think I'm gonna start again.

1238
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:22,050
Hello, ladies and gentlemen!

1239
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,920
Ignore the woman
who was here a minute ago.

1240
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,340
She's gone.

1241
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:27,630
Like your alibi tonight, sir.

1242
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:30,260
Your friend fell asleep
at a strip club.

1243
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:32,430
I'd hate to see what it takes
to keep him awake.

1244
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:36,980
Hey, you know
what I discovered today?

1245
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,730
You can take
your kids to the airport,

1246
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:41,520
put them on a plane, and just
fly them somewhere else.

1247
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:45,070
Technology is amazing.

1248
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:46,996
It used to be, for that kind
of peace and quiet,

1249
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,060
you had to leave your kids
on the steps of a church.

1250
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:51,180
And the dangerous thing is not

1251
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:52,376
that you're sending
your kids off

1252
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,800
with complete strangers
on a vehicle

1253
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:55,290
that has something
called a cockpit.

1254
00:48:55,490 --> 00:48:57,000
No.

1255
00:48:57,200 --> 00:48:59,096
The really dangerous thing
is that once they're gone,

1256
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:01,670
you have a chance
to remember what life

1257
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:03,300
was like without them.

1258
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:08,130
Right? It all comes
flooding back.

1259
00:49:08,330 --> 00:49:10,340
The clean floor.

1260
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:13,010
The calm apartment.

1261
00:49:13,210 --> 00:49:14,890
Your goddamned waistline.

1262
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:18,600
Sex.

1263
00:49:21,510 --> 00:49:24,860
Sex where you make it all
the way to the end.

1264
00:49:25,060 --> 00:49:26,690
Or at least your husband does.

1265
00:49:28,520 --> 00:49:30,360
- Ah. Got you, fucker.
- Sex anywhere!

1266
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:31,950
In any room, on any appliance.

1267
00:49:32,150 --> 00:49:33,230
Well, almost any appliance.

1268
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:35,370
I'd steer clear
of the cake mixer.

1269
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:37,330
No more turning
the volume on the news up

1270
00:49:37,530 --> 00:49:39,336
so when your kid asks
what those loud sounds were,

1271
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,346
you can say "Khrushchev
was banging his shoe again."

1272
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:44,590
I am going to admit to you
that, as scary as a threat

1273
00:49:44,790 --> 00:49:46,990
of a Soviet takeover is,
a small part of me is thinking,

1274
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:49,340
"Well, that'll cover blow job
Fridays for a while."

1275
00:49:51,170 --> 00:49:53,430
All right, my time is up.

1276
00:49:53,630 --> 00:49:55,760
I'm wanted in hell.

1277
00:49:55,960 --> 00:49:58,680
Please return your friend
to the upright position.

1278
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,190
You have been a kind
and forgiving audience.

1279

Don't forget

- Your writing staff.

I know you don't have
any female writers.

1316
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:33,030

How do you know I don't have
any women on my writing staff?

- Just a hunch.
- Well, my wife has been saying

1320
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,416
that the show could use
a woman's perspective.

1321
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:42,920
Sounds like your wife is
a smart lady.

1322

Take this job.

1339
00:52:13,560 --> 00:52:15,456
- I don't want to be a writer.
- Of course not. No one wants

1340
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:17,206
to be a writer, but this job
gets you in the building.

1341
00:52:17,230 --> 00:52:19,456
And once you're in the building,
you will get in his face,

1342
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,546
and you will make him fucking
laugh every time you see him.

1343
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:23,330
