1
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,160
Amongst the many
overnight success stories

2
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,540
in show business lore,

3
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,910
Midge Maisel's stands out
from the rest.

4
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:19,710
Her journey
from the Gaslight Caf

5
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:22,630
in New York's Greenwich Village
to worldwide fame and notoriety

6
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,590
is the stuff of legend.

7
00:00:24,790 --> 00:00:26,260
Often press-shy,

8
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,380
she agreed to sit down with me
and talk about her life.

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,800
Hey, you look a little nervous.
Are you?

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,550
Well, there's that body
in my trunk.

11
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,646
I've been meaning to dump it,
but the day got away from me.

12
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:36,890
It's been quite a ride.

13
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,390
Grammy winner, Emmy winner,

14
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,400
the French Order
of the Arts and Letters.

15
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:43,610
Does the phrase
"living legend" apply?

16
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:45,690
Geez, Mike, I'm not dead yet.

17
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:48,190
Wait, am I?
Call an ambulance.

18
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:50,320
Where'd this passion to perform
come from?

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:52,870
What drives Midge Maisel?

20
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:54,410
I just love what I do.

21
00:00:54,610 --> 00:00:56,740
I love talking to people,
present company excepted,

22
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,160
I'm kidding.

23
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:01,080
I like money,
I'm not ashamed of that.

24
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,380
And boy, oh, boy,
do I love the sound of laughs.

25
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,880
<i>And what she does is
make people laugh.</i>

26
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:09,550
<i>At age 30,</i>

27
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,970
<i>18 consecutive sold-out nights
at the Copacabana.</i>

28
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,300
<i>Numerous tours in the U.S.,
Canada,</i>

29
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,180
<i>and parts of Europe
all sell out in minutes.</i>

30
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,520
<i>There's the requisite
celebrity friendships.</i>

31
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,100
<i>Her shows with Bob Hope</i>

32
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,526
<i>and their many trips to Vietnam</i>

33
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,400
<i>were a favorite of the troops.</i>

34
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,150
Midge, you look wonderful.

35
00:01:27,350 --> 00:01:28,950
I love that gown.
Is that a Schiaparelli?

36
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,996
Oh, I'm sorry, Bob, but I've
forgotten where I bought it.

37
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:33,490
You mind if I look
at the label?

38
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,200
What does it say?

39
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,030
"Off limits."

40
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,910
That's negotiable.

41
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:41,120
<i>As her audience grew older,</i>

42
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,670
<i>her inclination to shock
grew bolder,</i>

43
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:45,290
<i>culminating in the now infamous</i>

44
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:48,000
<i>1971 show at Carnegie Hall.</i>

45
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,960
<i>How does a lady like that</i>

46
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,680
<i>have the to
show up looking like that?</i>

47
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,970
<i>Is anyone aware of
the First Amendment?</i>

48
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,720
<i>Still applies.</i>

49
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,936
<i>What could have been
a career-ending night of infamy</i>

50
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,180
<i>turned out to be...</i>

51
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,690
<i>As so many things do
in Midge Maisel's life...</i>

52
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,940
<i>The beginning of
a brand-new chapter,</i>

53
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:07,860
<i>with a brand-new audience
of young fans</i>

54
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:10,570
<i>through her audacious
college campus tours.</i>

55
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:13,700
<i>On top of all that,
she raised two children,</i>

56
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,780
<i>a son, Ethan, and a daughter,
Dr. Esther Maisel.</i>

57
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,790
What was it like having
Midge Maisel as your mother?

58
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:24,580
It was an incredible childhood,
filled with laughter and warmth.

59
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,880
She's a wonderful mother.

60
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,346
The other kids
must've been jealous.

61
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:30,210
Oddly, yes.

62
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:32,470
<i>And then there were the men.</i>

63
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:35,090
Men. Men and Midge Maisel.

64
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,510
So many men.

65
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:38,850
You sound like my accountant.

66
00:02:39,050 --> 00:02:41,850
<i>Four marriages, plus several,
or should I say multiple,</i>

67
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:43,480
<i>other relationships.</i>

68
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,650
<i>- What gives?
- I don't know.</i>

69
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,400
Lucky in life, unlucky in love.

70
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,690
I thought I'd marry once.
Joke's on me.

71
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:51,440
<i>And then there's
the relationship</i>

72
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:54,200
<i>that lasted longer
than all the others combined.</i>

73
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:56,950
<i>You were client number one
of the powerful</i>

74
00:02:57,150 --> 00:03:00,200
entertainment manager
Susie Myerson, is that right?

75
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,830
That's right.

76
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:04,830
You know her current
client list: Liza Minnelli,

77
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,580
<i>George Carlin, Barbra Streisand.</i>

78
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:09,250
<i>Just about everybody
in Hollywood.</i>

79
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,590
Everybody except you.

80
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,630
A 25-year friendship gone bust.

81
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:16,840
- What happened?
- What happened, Mike,

82
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,396
is that two people
in show business

83
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:19,890
tried to have a friendship.

84
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,390
Shall I read what she recently
said about you in <i>Variety?</i>

85
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:25,980
Don't bother, I've already
had it tattooed on my.

86
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,020
<i>And then there were her clothes.</i>

87
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,400
And you're putting
all these up for auction?

88
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,610
Every last button and bow.

89
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:35,780
In a way, these are my friends.

90
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:40,450
My first night at the Gaslight.
Yup, the story is true.

91
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:44,790
My B. Altman switchboard dress.
Those were fun times.

92
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,410
Oh, a classic.

93
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:50,630
What I wore the night of
the great tarmac dump of 1960.

94
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:52,630
Night five of my first Copa run.

95
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:54,210
What I wore to Woodstock...

96
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:56,920
I didn't perform,
but I sure got muddy.

97
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,010
Guest hosting <i>Johnny Carson,</i>
my cameo in <i>Mad, Mad World.</i>

98
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,180
Oh, and this.

99
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,680
The outfit I wore on my first
day as a writer for <i>Gordon Ford.</i>

100
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,770
My sitting outfit.

101
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,810
I put a lot of thought
into this one.

102
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:12,610
And where do the proceeds go?

103
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,980
The Weissman/Maisel
Children's Foundation,

104
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,360
for childhood education,
health, hunger, housing.

105
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,530
Children are my best teachers.

106
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:24,200
Through them, I've learned
to love, to laugh, to listen.

107
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,660
So everything I do,
I do for the children.

108
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,460
Hit the lights, ladies.

109
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:32,000
<i>And so comedy superstar
Midge Maisel soldiers on,</i>

110
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:35,840
<i>through success and adversity,
doing everything,</i>

111
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,170
<i>in her words,
"For the children."</i>

112
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,680
<i>Eat, damn it,
you little bastard!</i>

113
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,140
<i>Miriam!</i>

114
00:04:41,330 --> 00:04:42,680
He has to eat to survive.

115
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,060
- Not hungry!
- Deaf ears!

116
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,600
- Your fault.
- What is?

117
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,020
- The kids.
- We didn't force you to have kids.

118
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:50,620
No, but you created
the environment:

119
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,610
the dolls, the books
about being a mommy,

120
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,656
the-the quarter-scale
toy kitchen you rigged up for me

121
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:56,480
with the gas broiler
and the little fridge

122
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:58,320
that plugged
into a working socket.

123
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,070
I was very proud of that
until you were electrocuted.

124
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:03,046
And now I'm gonna need
some extra babysitting help.

125
00:05:03,070 --> 00:05:05,450
This new job is
five days a week.

126
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,256
Miriam, tell us again
how you're gonna be a writer

127
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,370
on <i>The Gordon Ford Show.</i>

128
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:09,570
I don't understand.

129
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:10,886
There's nothing more to tell.

130
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:11,966
He offered me a job
writing on the show,

131
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:12,990
and I said yes.

132
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,590
So, he just walks
around the city

133
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:17,090
asking strangers if they want
to be writers on his show?

134
00:05:17,290 --> 00:05:18,460
He sounds unstable.

135
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,476
No, I'm sure he has people
who normally do that,

136
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,840
but this time
it came directly from him.

137
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,280
But what's there to even write?

138
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,100
Doesn't he just make it all up
on the spot?

139
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:27,816
His whole opening monologue
is written for him.

140
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,480
Oh, I thought
he was just naturally funny.

141
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:31,350
This is shattering my illusions.

142
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:33,770
Sorry, I should have broken it
to you more gently.

143
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,610
- And you're sure it was him?
- Am I...

144
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:36,866
Because I read about this woman,

145
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,210
she was walking
down Sixth Avenue,

146
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,996
and who does she bump into
but Winston Churchill.

147
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,496
He tells her
he needs to get back to England

148
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,560
because his daughter's sick,
but he lost his wallet.

149
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:44,610
That's the worst.

150
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,160
So, she gives him
everything she had, $40.

151
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,870
Well, later on,
the same man is caught

152
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,676
walking around Union Square
with his pants at his ankles,

153
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,700
yelling at seagulls.

154
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,460
So it wasn't Winston Churchill?

155
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:54,790
That's my point.

156
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,630
Maybe it wasn't Gordon Ford
who hired you.

157
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:58,500
It was Gordon Ford, okay?

158
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,800
I got hired by Gordon Ford,

159
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,556
his pants were up,
and I accepted the job.

160
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:02,660
Now let's discuss the kids.

161
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:04,510
Oh, I'm happy to do all I can,
Miss Miriam.

162
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,930
I hope you know that.

163
00:06:06,130 --> 00:06:08,560
It's become a great joy
in my life, watching the kids.

164
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,060
And when I can't watch them,
well...

165
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,730
I can.

166
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,020
I love picking Ethan up
after school,

167
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,446
and Esther loves to come along.

168
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:17,900
She rides on my shoulders

169
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,030
and tells me, "Giddyap, Janusz!"

170
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,240
And that's when I giddyap
and go like the wind.

171
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,840
I'm happy to stay
and play with them

172
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,820
whenever you need me,
even at night.

173
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:27,620
They're fantastic.

174
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:31,410
My life was hard:
the war, the bombings.

175
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,710
So much suffering.

176
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,880
But, uh, spending time
with your children...

177
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:38,890
They make me think about
having my own children.

178
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:42,510
For the first time in my life.

179
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,380
Well, thank you.

180
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,440
Both of you.
I really appreciate it.

181
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,930
- Who is that?
- Don't you know?

182
00:06:52,130 --> 00:06:53,600
He always has
a screwdriver with him.

183
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,920
I thought he was a handyman.

184
00:06:54,970 --> 00:06:56,230
I didn't hire a handyman.

185
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:58,560
He seems very familiar
with the children.

186
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,760
And Zelda.

187
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:01,036
He's been here off and on
for weeks,

188
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,260
and none of us know who he is?

189
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,130
Whoever he is,
sounds like he's free.

190
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,210
Do not leave the salt out!

191
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,080
Since when
do we not leave the salt out?

192
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,670
The salt is always out!

193
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,800
I put it away always,
so the rats don't get in it.

194
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,460
It's not sugar, it's salt...

195
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:31,560
You stopped her on the street!

196
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,600
She stopped me!
She's a yenta!

197
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,156
She walks up and down the street
waiting to stop and schmooze!

198
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,900
Moishe Maisel, I have never said

199
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:42,360
an unkind word about you
to anyone!

200
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,400
Tell me when I did!

201
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,950
Just last year at Disneyland!

202
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,610
That jab about my tuchus!

203
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,166
What I said
to Donald Duck that day

204
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,490
is between me and Donald...

205
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,370
<i>Buddy, I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.</i>

206
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:53,910
How'd you know it was me?

207
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:55,796
I've been dreading the call
ever since I left you there.

208
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,120
- <i>How do you feel?</i>
- Like a tank hit me.

209
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,710
You went on a bender last night,
epic in scale.

210
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,460
- <i>Give me the headlines.</i>
- You walked in smashed.

211
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:07,346
- You were hitting on girls right in front of their dates.
- And one of them beat me up?

212
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,550
No, then you went onstage
and insulted the band.

213
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:10,750
And the band beat me up?

214
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,350
No. Then you did
a little stand-up,

215
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,230
and when I turned my back,
you disappeared.

216
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,646
<i>How you got back up
those stairs, I don't know,</i>

217
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:16,980
<i>but you were bleeding buckets.</i>

218
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,366
I took you
to the emergency room.

219
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,656
They patched you up
and released you,

220
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,150
but you couldn't go home,
not alone.

221
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:22,616
Your ribs are cracked,
you've got stitches.

222
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:25,230
So... I brought you there.

223
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,950
- <i>Please forgive me.</i>
- You're forgiven.

224
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,496
I talked to Grumpy
and Sneezy that day, too!

225
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:30,240
Oh, so you turned
all the Disney characters

226
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,876
- against me, very nice!
- Actually, you may not be forgiven just yet.

227
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,160
Jury's out.

228
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,540
<i>Anything I can do?</i>

229
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:37,660
Nah. I got an idea.

230
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,750
I'll talk to you later.

231
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:42,000
In your dreams!

232
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,380
You think Cinderella
wasn't looking me up and down?

233
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,750
Oh, yes, she was!

234
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:49,090
Hello! We're here!

235
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,680
Who's here?
Who is here?

236
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,090
Somebody's here!

237
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,800
Hi, Grandma. Hi, Grandpa.

238
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,020
- Were we expecting you?
- It's the kids.

239
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:58,146
When I asked how they wanted
to spend their Sunday,

240
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:00,100
they said with Grandma
and Grandpa Maisel.

241
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,600
How sweet.

242
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,730
Come give Grandpa a big hug
there, kids. Come on.

243
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:05,900
No, Grandma first.
Come to Grandma.

244
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,076
- I had dibs. No, come on, come on, <i>bubele.</i>
- Come on, come on.

245
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,286
Zaydee's waiting.
Grandpa has feelings, too.

246
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:10,626
No, you're gonna hurt
my feelings and break my heart.

247
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,086
And his knees are hurting
quite badly.

248
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,796
- My knees are hurting, too.
- You don't want to damage Grandpa's knees.

249
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:15,706
- Do you? I've got candy.
- My back's not so good either.

250
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:17,546
- Grandpa's knees are fine.
- And football injuries.

251
00:09:17,570 --> 00:09:19,626
- And my heart can break, too...
- - You don't want to break my heart.

252
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:21,410
- It's weak already.
- Oh, look, there he is.

253
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:23,290
Our little patient.

254
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:26,170
- Hi.
- Hi.

255
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:28,880
Don't be scared,
he's gonna be fine.

256
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,550
Your father was hit
by a very small car,

257
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,260
but already he's so much better.
Look, he's walking.

258
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,810
And did you grow?

259
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:39,430
- These aren't my pajamas.
- Okay.

260
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,390
I'm fine, guys. Really.

261
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:42,980
It looks worse than it is.

262
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:45,150
Hey, why don't you two go
into the living room

263
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:47,690
- and dig out your toys?
- I'll come with. Let's go, kids.

264
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:50,440
- Yeah, I'll be right in.
- - I didn't want to come here today.

265
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,610
- Go get your toys...
- Ma, where are my clothes?

266
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:54,990
At the dry cleaner's.
They were all dirty and bloody.

267
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,200
They'll be back in six,
eight hours tops.

268
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,040
But what are these?
They're not Ethan's.

269
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,540
They're not my old ones.

270
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,540
I keep a supply
of little boy pajamas

271
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:05,040
on hand at all times,
like everyone else.

272
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:07,000
No one else does that.

273
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,676
Hey, Shirley,
better get into the living room

274
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,386
- before the kids run out of hugs.
- Oh, yeah.

275
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,510
Kids, Grandma's coming.
Save me some hugs.

276
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:15,510
It's a long story.

277
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,140
Love to hear it. Come on.

278
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,890
Don't pull so hard.

279
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:21,620
Midge,
you're pulling the stitches.

280
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:25,600
Well?

281
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,980
I got into a scuffle.

282
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,230
That's your long story?
That wasn't even a haiku.

283
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:31,650
It was at the club.

284
00:10:31,850 --> 00:10:33,246
You got into a fight
at the club? Where was Archie?

285
00:10:33,270 --> 00:10:36,170
- I talked to Mei.
- Mei? Mei did not do this.

286
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,950
Joel? What about Mei?

287
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,500
There is no Mei, okay?

288
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,060
No Mei?

289
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,960
You broke up?
But what about the baby?

290
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,670
There's no Mei
and there's no baby.

291
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,970
There. You happy?

292
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,070
No baby? I...

293
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,930
No baby.

294
00:10:58,130 --> 00:10:59,640
She's moving. Moved.

295
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,520
She's already in Chicago.

296
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,710
- It's over.
- I'm sorry.

297
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,600
- No.
- Sorry.

298
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,900
I was afraid something like this
would happen.

299
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,020
- Like what?
- I...

300
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,730
- She wasn't ready.
- How do you know?

301
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:13,010
I just had a feeling
after we talked at the hospital.

302
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,496
- At the hospital?
- When we discussed the kids and how it would work...

303
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:17,996
- You mean with Pop? - ...she just didn't
seem to be on the same page as you.

304
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,830
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

305
00:11:20,020 --> 00:11:21,706
And you didn't think to maybe
give me a heads-up

306
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,796
that my whole fucking life was
about to come crashing down?

307
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,170
It was just a feeling I had,
an intuition.

308
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,136
You never should have spoken
to her in the first place.

309
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,926
- Joel...
- This is what could've pushed her over the edge.

310
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,420
Made her do what she did.

311
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,470
- Hey, that's not fair. She chose.
- With your help!

312
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,016
I'm gonna wait
till you get better to smack you

313
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,320
because now won't be fun.

314
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:42,600
I did nothing to push Mei away.

315
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,770
I've got eight hours
till my clothes are back.

316
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:46,410
I'm gonna go lie down.

317
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:54,040
- I could swing by your place and...
- I'm good.

318
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,290
Are you fucking kidding me?

319
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,830
Okay, so,
I thought I'd picked out

320
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:06,830
the perfect first day outfit
for <i>Gordon Ford.</i>

321
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:08,670
I mean, I spent hours
thinking about it,

322
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:10,590
sorting through multiple
color combinations,

323
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:12,580
but around 5:00 this morning,
something struck me.

324
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,800
Was it a blunt object?

325
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,260
- What?
- Go on.

326
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,220
This isn't a standing job.

327
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,590
It's a sitting job.

328
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,350
Huh. Explain.

329
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,010
B. Altman,
I stood at the counter.

330
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,350
That was a standing job.

331
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:26,106
Doing stand-up comedy,
that's a standing job.

332
00:12:26,130 --> 00:12:27,650
I know how to dress for that,
but this,

333
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,150
working at <i>Gordon Ford,</i>
this is a sitting job,

334
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,860
predominantly,
so the skirt can't be straight.

335
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,826
I mean, it can be straight
if there's a slit in it,

336
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:36,280
but not a side slit, no.

337
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,666
If I shift in my seat,
even a little,

338
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:38,950
they'll get an eyeful.

339
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,660
A back slit is okay, like a...

340
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,320
like a tasteful vent extension,

341
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:44,200
but again, that's more
for ease of walking.

342
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,700
So that brings us back to flare.
It needs to flare.

343
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,676
And it needs to flare
in a way that will accommodate

344
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,460
a variety of
different sitting positions.

345
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,960
Interesting.
Really interesting.

346
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:54,170
- And that's why you called?
- Yep.

347
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:58,170
So, to review, you called me at
four-fucking-fifty-fucking-six

348
00:12:58,370 --> 00:12:59,930
in the morning,
after hours of thought

349
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:02,200
and excessive consideration
about color combinations,

350
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,720
because you suddenly realized

351
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,390
that this job
would involve sitting?

352
00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:07,020
- Yeah.
- But before that,

353
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,446
you thought that
the job was to stand

354
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:10,196
in front of Gordon Ford
for eight straight hours

355
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,560
and pitch jokes?
That is just fucking dumb.

356
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,480
I don't know what the job is.

357
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:15,980
New rule, for you

358
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:18,360
and the entire demented moronic
fucking Weissman clan,

359
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,950
no one, and I mean no one, is
allowed to ring my goddamn phone

360
00:13:22,150 --> 00:13:24,160
before 10:30 in the morning
for any reason.

361
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,030
Here's a fresh cup, Miss Susie.

362
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,450
Unless It's Zelda.

363
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:29,080
'Cause I know if Zelda calls me,

364
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:30,926
she will make up for it
with something delicious.

365
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,500
- Thank you, Miss Susie.
- Mm-hmm.

366
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:34,000
Psst.

367
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,380
I have some major
household dish for you.

368
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,180
Is it dumb? Because really,
if it's dumb,

369
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:39,976
I am throwing you
out that goddamn window.

370
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,260
Zelda has a boyfriend.

371
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,970
A new one?
What happened to Janusz?

372
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,100
No, it is Janusz.
How do you know about Janusz?

373
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,980
She's been with him
for, like, four months.

374
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,486
I run into them on the nights
they hit the Village.

375
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:49,560
He's an excellent dancer.

376
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,770
How are you just
finding out about this?

377
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:54,236
- He just changed the hardware in the bathroom.
- That was him?

378
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,826
You didn't notice
a guy who looks like Mr. Clean

379
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,996
who's got a boner for Zelda
hanging out in your apartment?

380
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,660
Guess I'm not as observant
as I should be.

381
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:01,050
And you're
an observational comic.

382
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:03,036
I mean, really, there's
something missing in you.

383
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:05,370
Oh, shoot.
Drinks after work.

384
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:07,490
Not only do I need
an outfit for sitting at work,

385
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,650
but it has to be appropriate
for drinks with the gang.

386
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,870
Okay. This is not
a cocktail party.

387
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:14,120
It's a job. Here.

388
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,710
This...

389
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,400
with this and this.

390
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:22,170
- And this.
- Wow. That's great.

391
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,766
And you can sit in it
and everything?

392
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:25,356
I want to be sure
that you can sit in it.

393
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,940
- It's got enough flare?
- It's perfect.

394
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,810
- Going back to bed.
- Thank you, Susie.

395
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:30,310

Sorry, I'm-I'm talking to him.

400
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,080
Subway weirdo.

Midge!

402
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:33,660
I said no.
I don't want to talk to you.

403
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:37,540
Please wait. I...
I never got a chance to explain.

Oh, Midge, come on.

406
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:45,340
Excuse me, excuse me.
Bad man behind me.

407
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,430
I have no phone number for you,
no address.

408
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,640
- I had no way to contact you.
- Good.

409
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,180
I didn't want you to contact me.

410
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,810
Chanel? Really nice.

411
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:55,066
I went to the park
every morning for weeks.

412
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:56,180
You never showed.

413
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:58,440
That's because I never went
back to the park.

414
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,230
I brought flowers every day
to apologize.

415
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:02,786
I hope you brought 'em home
to the wife.

416
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:04,250
It's a shame to waste flowers.

417
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,570
- Ah, that is nice.
- Mm-hmm.

418
00:16:07,770 --> 00:16:10,320
Hey. Excuse me. Excuse me.

419
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:13,510
Two minutes.
That's all I ask. Look.

420
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:17,470
Two minutes!

421
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:24,250
Okay, that was fun and all,
but I just need to tell you...

422
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,860
Unbelievable.

423
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:33,350
Excuse me. Coming through.

424
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,560
- Make a hole, damn it.
- Rude!

425
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:36,890
Me?

426
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:38,736
You're the ones lined up
like the offensive line

427
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,410
of the Princeton Tigers.

428
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:46,230
- Hey!
- Oh, my God.

429
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,990
I'd never done that, I swear.

430
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,820
Done what? Stalked a woman
on the subway?

431
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,700
Brought a woman
back to my place.

432
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,380
- You mean you and your wife's place.
- It's not what you think.

433
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,870
I'm sorry,
but we talked and talked,

434
00:16:56,070 --> 00:16:57,620
and you never said
you were married.

435
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,500
- I'm not!
- So who was that, your sister?

436
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,466
Was your sister unhappy you were
sleeping with another woman?

437
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,596
- 'Cause that's a problem, too.
- You know, I'd really rather

438
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,300
that all of New York
not hear about this.

439
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,800
You're the one who started it.

440
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,420
Why are you going uptown now?

441
00:17:08,620 --> 00:17:09,720
You were going downtown.

442
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,090
This is downtown.

443
00:17:12,710 --> 00:17:13,710
Damn it.

444
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,480
Damn it. Midge? You here?

445
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,520
- Midge?
- Excuse me. Is there a problem?

446
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:27,656
I'm sorry, I was just looking
for a friend of mine.

447
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,280
Officer, that's the man who
assaulted me on the staircase.

448
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,610
- Assaulted you? When?
- I didn't assault anyone.

449
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:34,700
He cursed at us
and called us offensive.

450
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:37,430
- What the heck?
- They were blocking the staircase.

451
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:48,510
- Two minutes.
- Jesus H. Christ.

452
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:51,090
Then you never have to see me
again, I promise.

453
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,760
Tell him it's okay.

454
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,820
It's okay.

455
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,310
I messed up really bad.

456
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:02,020
I put you in an awful situation.

457
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,650
Awful? It was more than awful.

458
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:07,520
It was every synonym for awful,
you choose.

459
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,860
I'll work on one tonight.

460
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,610
- So, that was my wife.
- And not your sister.

461
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:13,330
But we were separated
and living apart.

462
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,530
That was my place.
She got our old house.

463
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,530
So, why'd she waltz in
like that?

464
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:18,870
To drop off the dog,

465
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:21,580
which she's supposed to do
with prior notice.

466
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,500
- And now we're getting divorced.
- You and the dog?

467
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:26,500
The marriage was over
long before I met you.

468
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,590
Look, Midge, meeting you,
the talks we had,

469
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:32,470
it was a lifesaver for me.

470
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,890
But I'm not here
to get you to reconsider.

471
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,950
I just want to apologize.

472
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:43,020
- How is the dog?
- She took the dog.

473
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,420
- What?
- And changed his name.

474
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:46,230
That's rotten.

475
00:18:46,430 --> 00:18:48,650
Did I ruin Riverside Park
for you? Tell me I didn't.

476
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,440
Just temporarily.
I'm back in it now.

477
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,650
Good, 'cause it's a great park.

478
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,450
It is.

479
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,950
Well, maybe we'll run into each
other there again, sometime.

480
00:18:59,150 --> 00:19:00,580
Maybe.

481
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:02,410
Maybe's good.

482
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,140
I'll take maybe.

483
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,330
Bye, Midge.

484
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,390
Goodbye, Sylvio.

485
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,420

Gordon doesn't hire
people personally.

501
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:56,340
I know it's unusual,
but he came to my strip club,

502
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,720
uh, my club,

503
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,010
- where I perform.
- Oh, I get it.

504
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,510
No, you don't.
I'm a stand-up. A comedian.

505
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:04,180
So, you're here
to be on the show?

506
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:05,980
You have to be booked
to be on the show.

507
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,620
You can't just walk in
off the street

508
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,040
and ask to be booked
on the show.

509
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,610
I didn't just walk in
off the street. Oh, wait.

510
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:14,110
He knows me. Mike! Mike! Mike!

511
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:16,280
Mike! Mike! Mike! Mike! Mike!

512
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,380
Mike! Mike! Midge Maisel.

513
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:20,710
Let her in.

514
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,620
You and I haven't
officially met.

515
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,580
Look, Mike,

516
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:31,506
I know you and Susie
got off to a rocky start.

517
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:33,960
Rocky start.
You're... very funny.

518
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:36,096
But now I'm here, and don't you
think it would be best to...

519
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,240
Do you know it has no smell?

520
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:38,930
What? What doesn't?

521
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:40,130
My tree.

522
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,570
Because it's
a piece of shit tree

523
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,110
that I grabbed
in haste to get away

524
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:45,600
from your little troll
of a manager. My apartment has

525
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:47,390
no Christmassy smell

526
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:48,850
'cause the goddamn tree

527
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,060
is a piece of shit,
lifeless tree.

528
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,860
You are gonna learn to like me.

529
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:55,610
Boy, you two, peas in a pod.

530
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:57,570
It may take a month,
two months tops.

531
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,030
Hell, give me six months,

532
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,746
and you and I are bowling
and drinking beer.

533
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:02,956
Look, I got to go, but would you
deliver a message to Susie?

534
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:03,980
Sure.

535
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:07,620
I will pass it on.

536
00:21:07,820 --> 00:21:10,060
You're late, by the way.

537
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,840
Those are the writers?
Is that...

538
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:15,216
Is that where
I'm supposed to go?

539
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:17,610
- That's the writers' room. Go.
- Thanks.

540
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,090
- Oop.
- - You don't think he could direct

541
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:24,300
- a drama, Alvin?
- - Mel was on Caesar with me.

542
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,600
I have no problem with
Mel Brooks. I like Mel Brooks.

543
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,100
Mel Brooks is funny.

544
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,560
- But?
- Here it comes.

545
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,190
- He likes air.
- Oh!

546
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,060
Oh, does he like air.

547
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:35,940
He comes in a room like a
Hoover, and he sucks it all up.

548
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,650
Ask Simon. Ask Gelbart.
Hell, ask Sid.

549
00:21:38,850 --> 00:21:41,110
The green-eyed monster doth
mock the meat it feeds on.

550
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:43,030
Geez, Cess, Shakespeare
before noon?

551
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,530
My only request, dear Alvin,

552
00:21:44,730 --> 00:21:46,740
please stop taking your hatred
for Mel Brooks

553
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,830
out on me just because
we share a name.

554
00:21:49,030 --> 00:21:51,100
- I don't hate Mel Brooks.
- Me neither.

555
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:54,250
Hi.

556
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:55,450
Am I in the right place?

557
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,530
- No.
- Don't think so.

558
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,726
This is the writers' room,
right?

559
00:21:57,750 --> 00:21:59,186
- Pretty much. - Who's asking?
- We're writers in a room.

560
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,760
Well, I'm your new writer.

561
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,130
Alvin?

562
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:04,106
George mentioned some girl
was starting with us.

563
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:04,930
He didn't say when.

564
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:06,260
Well, I'm some girl,

565
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,820
and today is the day.
Who's George?

566
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,890
- You'll know him when you see him.
- Mothballs.

567
00:22:10,090 --> 00:22:11,770
- Boat shoes.
- I have boat shoes.

568
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:13,776
I wouldn't have minded being
consulted about a new hire,

569
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:16,480
but I'm just the head writer,
so what do I know? Milly?

570
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:18,020
- Midge.
- Midge?

571
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,206
Never trust people whose names
don't rhyme with anything.

572
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,400
Smidge. Bridge. Fridge.

573
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,360
Shit.

574
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,030
That's Ralph, Mel, Adam, Cecil,

575
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,660
- and I'm Alvin. Sit.
- Great.

576
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:28,410
Got my sitting outfit on.

577
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:30,450
- Your what?
- It's a flared skirt

578
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,926
for sitting instead of standing.

579
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,586
I mean, you can stand in it,
but it looks good

580
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:34,610
when you're sitting, too.

581
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,380
Got that versatility,
like pants.

582
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,040
So, Gordon's in a foul mood.

583
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,480
- Again?
- What in that man's charmed life is so terrible?

584
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:41,766
- He's given up smoking.
- Oh, Jesus.

585
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,936
- Oh, come on.
- Oh, for God's sake.

586
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,160
And he doesn't want anyone else

587
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:45,590
smoking in the office.

588
00:22:45,790 --> 00:22:47,726
If he gets divorced, does
everyone else have to, too?

589
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:49,560
Can I finish
this one at least? No?

590
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,730
Guess cancer will have to wait.

591
00:22:51,920 --> 00:22:53,310
First they came
for the cigarettes,

592
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:54,640
and I did not speak out.

593
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,080
So, let's get going here, boys.

594
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,190
- Give me a good mix, 20 in one.
- Uh...

595
00:22:58,390 --> 00:22:59,980
What... Wait, where...

596
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,070
Um, Alvin, what's 20 in one?

597
00:23:02,270 --> 00:23:03,900
Yeah?

598
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,376
Yeah, I know
Bernstein's tonight.

599
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:06,950
I read the memo.

600
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:09,530
No, I'm not gonna hand him
a bunch of dumb Maestro jokes.

601
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:12,290
Come on, Alex. Just give him
a goddamn cigarette.

602
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:18,630
Hi. Hey.

603
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,670
Any idea what 20 in one is?

604
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:23,130
Nope.

605
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:25,090
<i>The Gordon Ford Show.</i>

606
00:23:25,290 --> 00:23:27,140
Yes, he's quit smoking.

607
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:28,690
Well, we're spreading
the word now,

608
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,850
we weren't keeping it from you.

609
00:23:31,050 --> 00:23:33,980
Yes, we all have
to quit smoking.

610
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,940
Oh, hi, Midge.
Susie, it's Midge.

611
00:23:36,140 --> 00:23:38,770
She sounds a little weird.

612
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,070
How's it going, champ?

613
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,940
Panic. I'm in a panic. Oh, boy.

614
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,900
- Take a deep breath.
- I'm hyperventilating.

615
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,530
<i>Stick
your head between your legs.</i>

616
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:47,950
Who is that? Dinah?

617
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,910
Or have a cigarette.

618
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,086
- <i>What is wrong with you?
</i> - Why didn't you tell me

619
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:52,910
<i>about 20 in one?</i>

620
00:23:53,110 --> 00:23:54,620
I don't know. What is 20 in one?

621
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,740
The head writer just sent us
off to do 20 in one.

622
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,790
It's 20 jokes in one hour,
and that was eight minutes ago,

623
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:03,000
so I've got... I'm so freaked
out, I can't even do the math.

624
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,920
You've got 52 minutes
to write 20 jokes.

625
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,050
Quick math here, that's a joke
every 2.6 minutes. Ha.

626
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,800
- <i>Finally using math.</i>
- Not helping.

627
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,606
And I'm assuming they need to be
broadcast quality jokes.

628
00:24:11,630 --> 00:24:12,430
Each one a winner.

629
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:14,270
Dinah, why are you on the phone?

630
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,750
I got her on
to listen and learn.

631
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:17,156
It's how all
the big agencies do it.

632
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:19,020
You're now down to a joke
every 2.5 minutes.

633
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,580
You're not supposed
to talk, Dinah.

634
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,190
I don't toss jokes off
like that.

635
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,530
They take time. I mold them,

636
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:26,246
massage them,
and now I'm just blanking,

637
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:27,400
and the clock is ticking.

638
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,786
Well, let's prime the pump here,
get the juices flowing.

639
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:32,910
How about this? Uh, Washington
Square Park isn't square,

640
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:34,990
it's a rectangle, so they
should change the name

641
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:36,660
to Washington Rectangle Park.

642
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:38,580
- Oh, that's cute.
- That's a terrible joke.

643
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,780
Yeah, well I'm not the
fucking joke writer. You are.

644
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,380
No, I'm not. I told you that.

645
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,920
Well, you've got the job,
so fake it till you make it.

646
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:48,090
I should check my notebook.
See if anything inspires me.

647
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:50,530
All that matters is that
Gordon Ford thinks you're funny.

648
00:24:50,670 --> 00:24:52,680
How's it going with him?
You two bonding?

649
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,526
I haven't seen him.
I think he's in a different part

650
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:56,566
of the building. And was I
supposed to have an office?

651
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:57,946
<i>Because I don't seem
to have an office.</i>

652
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:58,770
I didn't think about that.

653
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,060
Barely even have a chair,

654
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:01,826
and I-I have no idea
where the ladies' room is,

655
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:03,326
and everyone seems
to be talking in code,

656
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:05,440
and Mike Carr wanted me
to pass this on to you.

657
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:06,880
<i>I assume you're flipping me off.</i>

658
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,860
Both fingers. I got to go.

659
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:11,450
Got to start thinking...
writing. Goodbye.

660
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,410
<i>Gordon Ford Show.</i>

661
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:17,540
I really loved him.

662
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:18,830
He's the one I miss.

663
00:25:19,030 --> 00:25:20,710
How did your second husband die?

664
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,710
Well, it was the darndest thing.

665
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,636
It was winter, and he was
walking down the street

666
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,460
- when he slipped on ice.
- Oh, my God.

667
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,260
It gets worse.
The street was on a hill,

668
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,180
and he slid all the way down
where these men

669
00:25:31,250 --> 00:25:32,970
- were running a wood chipper.
- Oh, my God.

670
00:25:33,130 --> 00:25:35,720
It gets worse.
Rose, where are you going?

671
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,810
Oh, no. Oh, my God.

672
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:42,650
- What happened?
- A fire happened, lady.

673
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:43,850
Now, please, back away.

674
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:45,650
- But how?
- Could be electrical,

675
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:46,946
could be arson,
we don't know yet.

676
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:47,980
Arson...

677
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,990
This is too much.

678
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,650
This is too damn much.

679
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:53,740
What is, Rose?
What's too damn much?

680
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,220
My tearoom.

681
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:03,540
Mr. Carr, Florence on 2.

682
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,470
I think that was
just 59 minutes.

683
00:26:12,670 --> 00:26:14,890
Shut up. All right, Mel,
you look smug

684
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,260
and self-satisfied.
Start us off.

685
00:26:17,460 --> 00:26:19,470
"Last week marked
the Broadway debut of <i>Camelot</i>

686
00:26:19,670 --> 00:26:20,896
and the off-Broadway debut
of <i>Cam-A-Little."</i>

687
00:26:20,920 --> 00:26:21,980
Put it in the maybes.

688
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,180
- Adam?
- Uh...

689
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:24,300
"It's that time of year,

690
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:25,710
kids are writing
letters to Santa."

691
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,826
He doesn't like Santa jokes.

692
00:26:26,850 --> 00:26:28,110
Can I finish?

693
00:26:28,310 --> 00:26:29,860
"Isn't the faith
of a child amazing?

694
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,076
To believe that Santa Claus
will come down your chimney

695
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,340
with presents, even after
seeing him hungover at Macy's."

696
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,240
- He doesn't like Santa jokes.
- Shit.

697
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,580
- Ralphy?
- Skipping over my Santa jokes.

698
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,910
Uh, "So, you may have heard
that NASA is planning

699
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,540
to send a chimp into space.

700
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,500
They wanted to send a chump,
but Jerry Lewis

701
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,960
and my producer George
refused to go."

702
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:48,676
Run it by George,
see if it bothers him.

703
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,300
They need to cut
to a shot of him. Cecil?

704
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:52,720
I miss Nixon.

705
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,010
- And?
- Oh, that's it, that's all I got.

706
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:57,760
Astounding professionalism,
Cess. I'll get back to you.

707
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,310
New girl?

708
00:26:59,510 --> 00:27:01,180
Oh, uh... that's me.

709
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,566
Only one with girl parts
in the room.

710
00:27:02,590 --> 00:27:03,600
Don't make assumptions.

00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:04,800

Gesundheit.

750
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:38,110
Thank you. You should probably
be getting to your lunch.

751
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,110
Oh, dear,
I lost track of the time.

752
00:28:40,310 --> 00:28:41,820
Gesundheit.

753
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:43,790
I'd go, but this damn cold.

754
00:28:43,980 --> 00:28:46,040
Maury downstairs has
a really bad cold, too.

755
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,660
Anything specific you want me
to discuss with her, or...

756
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,260
It's just a
"get to know you" lunch.

757
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:52,216
She'll talk up some things
she wants to bring to New York,

758
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:55,210
bend your ear a little bit.
She liked your review, too.

759
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:56,710
Gesundheit.

760
00:28:56,910 --> 00:28:58,010
- Thank you.
- Which one?

761
00:28:58,210 --> 00:29:00,180
That comedy she transferred
from the West End.

762
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,470
<i>A Pudding for Nigel.</i>

763
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:02,970
Oh, that was wonderful.

764
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,370
I did pick at it a little bit.

765
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,560
And she made changes
based on your criticism.

766
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,730
Said they made it so much...

767
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:10,650
so much...

768
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:12,230
Let's go with "better."

769
00:29:12,430 --> 00:29:13,770
Penelope is a true Brit.

770
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,996
Her father owns six newspapers,
her mother is a baroness,

771
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,690
they're very chummy
with the Royals.

772
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,170
- Wow.
- She'll tell you stories.

773
00:29:19,270 --> 00:29:21,530
- Great stories. It'll be fun.
- I'll report back.

774
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,950
And the <i>Voice</i> pays for lunch.
We take no favors.

775
00:29:24,150 --> 00:29:26,080
Got it.

776
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:28,080
I was going to say "better."

777
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,910
We figured.

778
00:29:45,820 --> 00:29:46,820
Francie.

779
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:50,140
Double, triple,
quadruple-check this.

780
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,440
If they crap out again,
we find a new car service.

781
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:54,980
- How was your morning?
- Really?

782
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:57,820
Just trying to break the ice.
I gave Susie your message.

783
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:00,530
Well, there he is,
spectacularly late,

784
00:30:00,730 --> 00:30:02,610
as always. Harassing the staff.

785
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:04,990
- Oh, he's in fine form.
- Who is that?

786
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,120
That is George Toledano,

787
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,500
venerated producer
of <i>The Gordon Ford Show.</i>

788
00:30:09,700 --> 00:30:12,250
Oh. I've been hearing about him.
Would you mind introducing us?

789
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,880
I want him to die.

790
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:16,420
- So, I should introduce myself?
- A long,

791
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,420
painful death.
I want him to fall off

792
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:20,720
that stupid tiny dinghy
he calls a yacht,

793
00:30:20,910 --> 00:30:22,110
but I don't want him to drown.

794
00:30:22,290 --> 00:30:23,930
I want him to float

795
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,890
on a splintery piece
of driftwood.

796
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:28,890
That asinine, condescending,
supercilious...

797
00:30:29,090 --> 00:30:30,560
George. How are you today?

798
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,100
Mikey, my boy.
How's it going, old sport?

799
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,350
Oh, you know, George,
same old, same old.

800
00:30:35,550 --> 00:30:37,570
I don't believe I've met
this sight for sore eyes.

801
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,480
I'm a new writer, sir.
Midge Maisel.

802
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,610
I heard we had a lady writer
coming aboard.

803
00:30:41,810 --> 00:30:43,860
Nice to meet you.
And call me George.

804
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,360
You can call me George, too.

805
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,160
Funny. I like that.

806
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:48,620
You must know Madelyn Pugh.

807
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:50,330
I don't think so.

808
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:52,620
Wrote for <i>I Love Lucy?</i>
Funny lady.

809
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,136
How about, uh, Nancy Clark?
Writes for <i>The Ann Sothern Show.</i>

810
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,966
Oh, she doesn't know
every lady writer, George.

811
00:30:56,990 --> 00:30:59,500
- Nice to have you here.
- Thank you.

812
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,090
- Nice boat shoes.
- Ooh.

813
00:31:01,290 --> 00:31:03,130
You certainly
beautify the place.

814
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:05,530
I can cancel those
new plants I ordered.

815
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:10,140
He gets kissy at parties,
so watch yourself.

816
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:12,140
- Thanks for the warning.
- Goddamn it.

817
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,410
Goddamn writers
handing me this crap.

818
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,530
Can we just toss
cigarettes at him?

819
00:31:22,730 --> 00:31:24,990
- Lit?
- That's a fire hazard.

820
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:26,610
Back to the
drawing board, fellas.

821
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:27,810
Let's assemble.

822
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:29,160
They'll get us there, Gordy.

823
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:30,830
They always do.

824
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:33,300
- Unbelievable.
- Wow. - God.

825
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:36,040
So, what's the deal?

826
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,040
He wants them shorter
and not topical.

827
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:39,040
Now he tells us.

828
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:40,420
Wasted the whole morning.

829
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,310
Until the bell, guys.
20 in one.

830
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:46,430
- I need coffee.
- Trudy, coffee run.

831
00:31:46,630 --> 00:31:49,760
Everything shut down during the
war. The arts were decimated.

832
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:51,160
Were you there the whole time?

833
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:52,970
I was in London
during the Blitz.

834
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:54,350
I saw the German Luftwaffe

835
00:31:54,550 --> 00:31:55,810
flying through the air.

836
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:57,980
My grandmother's house
in Mayfair was bombed.

837
00:31:58,180 --> 00:31:59,980
- My God.
- She lived,

838
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:01,540
but we thought
the world had ended.

839
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,990
Then, in '44, Larry did
<i>Richard the Third.</i>

840
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:06,360
- Larry?
- Olivier.

841
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,860
- Ah.
- I sat in the front row,

842
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:11,700
and, I don't know, my faith
in mankind was restored.

843
00:32:11,900 --> 00:32:13,836
- I knew that we could beat Hitler.
- That's wonderful.

844
00:32:13,860 --> 00:32:14,860
Then I slept with Larry.

845
00:32:15,030 --> 00:32:16,660
That's better than
sleeping with Hitler.

846
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:19,300
I know it sounds silly, but that
helped restore my faith, too.

847
00:32:19,450 --> 00:32:21,460
- Mm.
- Our <i>le flottante,</i>

848
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,630
- and it's on the house.
- Darling boy, thank you.

849
00:32:23,830 --> 00:32:25,720
- <i>L'addition,</i> s'il vous plait?
- Right away.

850
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,720
Abraham, I'll leave you
with this,

851
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,090
Harold Pinter.

852
00:32:29,290 --> 00:32:31,130
I'm bringing <i>The Birthday Party</i>
here in spring,

853
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:33,470
- and I want you to see it.
- I'd love to.

854
00:32:33,670 --> 00:32:36,430
He's not for everybody,
but I think he's a mad genius,

855
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:39,520
and he's only 30,
such a young, virile age.

856
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,110
The Nobel is in his future.

857
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:42,980
- I'll be there.
- Music to my ears.

858
00:32:43,180 --> 00:32:45,690
Oh, dear, it's so much later
than I thought.

859
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:48,490
Ah, this is on the <i>Voice.</i>

860
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:50,280
So kind.

861
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,160
I should bring my wife here.
She'd love this place.

862
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:54,620
She's such a Francophile.

863
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:56,370
- My husband is French.
- Ah.

864
00:32:56,570 --> 00:32:59,420
They should meet. Now,
I'm so sorry, I have to dash.

865
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,380
More <i>le flottante pour moi.</i>

866
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:05,050
If I had known I'd be
dining with such a charming man,

867
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,710
I'd have scheduled time
to linger.

868
00:33:06,910 --> 00:33:09,480
Next time I won't make
that mistake.

869
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:14,760
This...

870
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:16,430
this wallet

871
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,100
is so old.

872
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:19,480
I really need

873
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,980
change it out.

874
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,060
I'm trying to

875
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:26,730
remember how old it is.
Maybe seven, eight years.

876
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:29,700
You don't think to change
your wallet till you get one

877
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:32,030
as a gift, but if you
don't get one as a gift,

878
00:33:32,230 --> 00:33:33,950
you never change your wallet.

879
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:36,370
- How are you liking it?
- Liking what?

880
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:37,910
The, uh, dessert?

881
00:33:38,110 --> 00:33:40,160
Ah, it's... it's...

882
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,330
ve-ve-very-very good, very
fine. Here.

883
00:33:42,530 --> 00:33:44,340
- Ah. <i>Merci.</i>
- Here.

884
00:33:44,530 --> 00:33:45,920
You are silly.

885
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,670
At times, yes,
but at other times

886
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:51,630
I'm more... dramatic,

887
00:33:51,830 --> 00:33:54,890
like Olivier, or not Olivier,
I'm nothing like Olivier.

888
00:33:55,090 --> 00:33:56,720
I'm more like...

889
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:58,930
Buster Keaton,

890
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:01,140
just a big, old,

891
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:04,230
sad, floppy clown boy.

892
00:34:04,430 --> 00:34:06,520
Sweet.

893
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,170
Till next time.

894
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:18,296
They've been gone a long time.
That's a good sign, right?

895
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:19,700
Not necessarily. Last Tuesday?

896
00:34:19,900 --> 00:34:21,290
We almost didn't make it to air.

897
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:23,296
- Should I get my typewriter?
- Do not get your typewriter.

898
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,306
- What are we waiting for?
- The verdict from rehearsal.

899
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,710
Here they come.
Duck and cover.

900
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:28,710
- Ah, hell.
- Goddamn it, Teddy.

901
00:34:28,910 --> 00:34:30,840
- I love you guys, too.
- What happened?

902
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:33,240
He's the cue card guy. Means
the monologue's not locked.

903
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:35,186
- Should I get my typewriter?
- Do not get your typewriter.

904
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:36,430
- What's left?
- Zip.

905
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:38,356
- He threw the entire thing out.
- Holy shit.

906
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:39,520
It's one hour to show.

907
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,896
Should've gotten my typewriter.

908
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,930
Definitely.

909
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,410
I know it's disappointing, gang,

910
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:45,020
but ours is not to reason why,

911
00:34:45,220 --> 00:34:47,230
ours is but to write
new jokes or die.

912
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:51,240
Now, I've got to go say hello
to Angie Dickinson.

913
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:53,820
Poor me.

914
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:57,030
Okay, guys, lightning round.
Old, new, whatever you got.

915
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,580
Oh, shit.

916
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,100
- Trudy, hustle.
- I'm already in.

917
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:01,500
Gordon wants 'em topical.

918
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,216
You said before
he wanted 'em not topical.

919
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:05,710
Gordon is large, he contains
multitudes. Ralphy?

920
00:35:05,910 --> 00:35:07,840
Uh, topical, topical...

921
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,420
Uh, "Emily Post died,
so now no one knows

922
00:35:10,620 --> 00:35:12,476
the proper etiquette
to send their condolences."

923
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,880
- Not bad.
- Get it down. Cess?

924
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,400
Uh, "I went to the premiere
of a French film the other day.

925
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,640
It's called
<i>Le Hau-hau-hau-hau-hauuu."</i>

926
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,810
"Translates roughly
into English as

927
00:35:21,010 --> 00:35:22,390
<i>Le Hau-hau-hau-hau-hauuu."</i>

928
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,630
Not bad. We should follow
it up with something. Mel?

929
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,900
<i>"Ben-Hur,</i> if he's a him,
what's with the Hur?"

930
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,900
- Pass. Adam?
- Uh, "Some sad news,

931
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,320
Clark Gable passed away.
He's survived by his wife,

932
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,760
his children and his mustache."

933
00:35:32,810 --> 00:35:34,650
He loved Gable.
Put it in. Who else?

934
00:35:34,850 --> 00:35:38,240
Uh, well, I worked on some
new stuff during rehearsal.

935
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:40,030
- You what?
- Jesus.

936
00:35:40,230 --> 00:35:42,030
- I worked on some new stuff.
- She jinxed it.

937
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:43,540
- You jinxed it.
- Jinxed what?

938
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,460
We never work on new stuff
during rehearsal,

939
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,370
- ever.
- What? Why?

940
00:35:47,570 --> 00:35:49,730
It guarantees that Gordon's
gonna throw everything out.

941
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:52,191
I'm sorry, Gordon somehow knew
I was sitting in a bathroom

942
00:35:52,290 --> 00:35:53,550
stall jotting down jokes?

943
00:35:53,750 --> 00:35:55,646
That's why he threw out
the script? Is he omniscient?

944
00:35:55,670 --> 00:35:56,760
If anyone is...

945
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:59,140
Let the girl pitch.
Go on, Midge.

946
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,600
Thank you, Alvin.

947
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,270
<i>"The Unsinkable Molly Brown</i>

948
00:36:03,470 --> 00:36:04,510
is a new show on Broadway.

949
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:05,776
I heard that the ushers
are seating

950
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,440
women and children first."

951
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:09,480
She was on the <i>Titanic.</i>

952
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,160
He nixed a <i>Molly Brown</i> joke
last week.

953
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,270
- Mine.
- Got another?

954
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,150
Yeah, um...

955
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:17,360
"There's gonna be a baby in
the White House, little JFK Jr.

956
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,680
It'll be a clean transition.

957
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:19,956
White House staff
already learned

958
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,620
how to change diapers
with Eisenhower."

959
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,240
"A" for effort. Cess?

960
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,410
- Oh, now wait a minute.
- Yeah?

961
00:36:25,610 --> 00:36:27,330
I'm sorry,
but that last one was funny.

962
00:36:27,530 --> 00:36:29,290
- No, it wasn't.
- Yes, it was.

963
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:31,380
- No one laughed.
- I think the audience would,

964
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:32,806
and it's topical,
he wants topical.

965
00:36:32,830 --> 00:36:33,880
A joke is not funny

966
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,346
just because you say it's funny.

967
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:37,170
No, it's not funny
because I say it's funny.

968
00:36:37,370 --> 00:36:38,570
It's funny because it's funny.

969
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,470
- And you know funny?
- Yeah, I know funny.

970
00:36:40,670 --> 00:36:42,180
Great. Alvin,
put my <i>Ben-Hur</i> joke in

971
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:44,106
because I know funny,
and I think it's funny.

972
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:45,770
- Mel...
- Your B<i>en-Hur </i>joke was not funny.

973
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,060
- Oh, really?
- Or topical or fresh.

974
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:50,860
Wasn't even funny when I heard
Jack Paar do it two weeks ago.

975
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,230
- Oh!
- Alvin.

976
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:54,570
We have no time for this.
Sorry. Cess, go.

977
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:56,070
Okay, uh...

978
00:36:56,270 --> 00:36:57,496
"There's a commercial
for dishwashing soap.

979
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,240
- Any of you see it?"
- I bet she did.

980
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:03,240
Hi, yes,
he's expecting your call.

981
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,540
Abe, how was your meeting?

982
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:07,410
Cover your goddamn
mouth, Terrence.

983
00:37:07,610 --> 00:37:09,120
- That was harsh.
- Gabe, Gabe.

984
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,540
- Abe, you okay?
- I've got a question,

985
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:13,840
and be honest because

986
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,050
I don't know all the intricacies

987
00:37:16,250 --> 00:37:17,760
of New York theater customs...

988
00:37:17,960 --> 00:37:19,590
Okay.

989
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:22,930
Is this sexual?

990
00:37:23,130 --> 00:37:24,760
So many thoughts

991
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,396
running through my mind
right now, Abe.

992
00:37:26,420 --> 00:37:28,390
- You're wondering why I'm asking.
- Very much.

993
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:30,480
At my lunch with Penelope,

994
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,350
it was all going so smoothly.

995
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:35,860
We talked about theater
and criticism and the war.

996
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:39,280
Then she did this with her hand,

997
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:41,070
- and it felt...
- Sexual?

998
00:37:41,270 --> 00:37:42,620
- Yes.
- That's because it is.

999
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:44,910
I knew it.

1000
00:37:45,110 --> 00:37:47,080
So, it was a sexualized gesture.

1001
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,620
One of the oldest.

1002
00:37:48,820 --> 00:37:51,750
You can remove your hand now.

1003
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:53,330
I don't get it.

1004
00:37:53,530 --> 00:37:55,040
I don't get it. It was lunch.

1005
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,420
So?

1006
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:59,300
Nothing sexual happens
before 7:00 in the evening,

1007
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,050
6:30 at the earliest.

1008
00:38:01,250 --> 00:38:04,760
Never at 1:42 in the afternoon
on a Monday.

1009
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:07,010
I am learning a lot
about you today.

1010
00:38:07,210 --> 00:38:09,600
I've been racking my brain,
trying to think if I said

1011
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,140
something that gave her
the wrong impression.

1012
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,900
Was I too kind
to <i>A Pudding for Nigel?</i>

1013
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:16,100
Is that all it takes?

1014
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,326
That, and a hearty Bordeaux.

1015
00:38:17,350 --> 00:38:18,406
How did you know we had wine?

1016
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,690
Because you smell like wine.

1017
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:21,490
Oh, my God, we had wine.

1018
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:23,206
You know, she's never made
a pass at me. Terrence,

1019
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,496
has Penelope ever made
a pass at you?

1020
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:26,240
Uh-uh. She knows
I'm a homosexual.

1021
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,330
- What? Since when?
- Since birth, probably.

1022
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:30,546
- But you're married.
- Oh, I left my wife years ago.

1023
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:31,370
I live with Maury now.

1024
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:32,960
From accounting? With the cold.

1025
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,400
Terrence, we need to talk more.

1026
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:36,790
Gabe, what do I tell my wife?

1027
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:40,210
- Your wife?
- Yes, my wife.

1028
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:41,590
Nothing.

1029
00:38:41,790 --> 00:38:43,680
- Abe, nothing happened.
- Nothing happened,

1030
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,220
but something happened.

1031
00:38:45,420 --> 00:38:47,010
But nothing happened.

1032
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:49,010
She'll know. She'll sense it.

1033
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:52,100
Abe, do not tell her
about Penelope.

1034
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,270
About you and me just now,
yes, but not her,

1035
00:38:54,470 --> 00:38:56,590
and I promise never to put you
in that position again.

1036
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:57,440
You are too tempting.

1037
00:38:57,640 --> 00:38:58,770
Gabe.

1038
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:01,190
- It's all in the past.
- Maybe.

1039
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:02,740
It's in the past.
Say it with me.

1040
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:04,700
It's in the past.

1041
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,660
Good.

1042
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:09,280
- Wasn't Maury married?
- He lived with his sister.

1043
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:12,550
That was his sister?
I am so out of the loop.

1044
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:16,330
He's on the move!

1045
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:18,050
- He's on the move.
- He's on the move.

1046
00:39:18,080 --> 00:39:19,550
- He's on the move.
- Where's Adam?

1047
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,630
- Yeah, where is Adam?
- It's showtime.

1048
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:23,170
I was saying hi to my parents.

1049
00:39:23,370 --> 00:39:25,180
What are you, 14?

1050
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:26,550
Keep the aisles clear.

1051
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:29,430
And if you do have to leave,
please do so quietly.

1052
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:32,020
Emergency exit doors are
on both sides in the back.

1053
00:39:32,220 --> 00:39:33,930
Other than that,
make a lot of noise

1054
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:36,450
when it comes to showing
Gordon you are happy to be here.

1055
00:39:36,550 --> 00:39:38,150
- Do we have a monologue?
- No idea.

1056
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:40,520
You sound like a
great audience, guys. Feel free

1057
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,120
to laugh at anything
you find funny,

1058
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:43,670
and applaud
when we light the sign.

1059
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,120
Whoa. Whoa.

1060
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:51,740
We didn't even light the sign.

1061
00:39:51,940 --> 00:39:54,250
You're already
disobeying orders.

1062
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:56,370
We got a great show tonight.
See you in a minute.

1063
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:02,090
Okay, so let's do Clark Gable,
Emily Post, the NASA joke,

1064
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,936
the automat joke
that we dropped on Friday...

1065
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,896
Put that next to last... and did
the Dennis the Red Menace thing

1066
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,556
- make it past the censors?
- They didn't flag it.

1067
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,646
We're basically saying
the kid's a communist.

1068
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:09,470
They didn't flag it.

1069
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,030
Put it in.
And I'll throw in a riff

1070
00:40:11,170 --> 00:40:13,106
about the hat on the lady in the
second row. She wore that thing

1071
00:40:13,130 --> 00:40:14,530
- to be noticed.
- You got it, boss.

1072
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,850
- Teddy?
- I thrive on this.

1073
00:40:16,050 --> 00:40:17,050
Good man.

1074
00:40:17,090 --> 00:40:18,440
The cavalry comes through again.

1075
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:19,440
Wow.

1076
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:20,770
Right down to the wire.

1077
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:22,110
He keeps us on our toes.

1078
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:23,530
Places, everyone.

1079
00:40:23,730 --> 00:40:25,240
Places, everyone.

1080
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,740
Sorry about before.

1081
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:30,030
I checked with a friend,
Paar did do that joke. Fuck me.

1082
00:40:30,230 --> 00:40:32,370
Hey, Teddy, you posing
for the <i>Kama Sutra?</i>

1083
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:33,700
Up yours, Mel.

1084
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,080
Ladies and gentlemen,

1085
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,870
it's <i>The Gordon Ford Show!</i>

1086
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,340
Tonight's guests:
Angie Dickinson,

1087
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,460
Steve Lawrence,
and novelist Ray Bradbury.

1088
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:47,050
Now here's your host,

1089
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,760
Gordon Ford!

1090
00:40:56,720 --> 00:40:58,480
Thanks, everyone.
Thanks for coming out.

1091
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:00,560
It's getting festive here
in New York, isn't it?

1092
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:02,020
With all the twinkling lights

1093
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:03,610
and window displays
and chestnuts

1094
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:05,250
roasting over
an open trash can fire.

1095
00:41:05,390 --> 00:41:06,940
He doesn't like us
in his eyeline.

1096
00:41:07,140 --> 00:41:08,610
It's a generous time of year.

1097
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:10,746
- My mom looks so old.
- - A guy picked the wallet

1098
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,836
right out of my pocket,
gave it back to me gift-wrapped.

1099
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:14,336
I mean it, it had a ribbon
on it and everything.

1100
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,250
George, you've had
your pocket picked.

1101
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,800
Did you ever get that original
copy of the Magna Carta back?

1102
00:41:20,070 --> 00:41:21,506
I told you not to carry
that thing around like that.

1103
00:41:21,530 --> 00:41:24,000
More fool me.

1104
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,300
Of course, you've all heard
the sad news,

1105
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,510
- the great Clark Gable has passed away.
- - Aw...

1106
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,270
He's survived
by his wife, his children,

1107
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:32,470
and his mustache.

1108
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:35,390
Now, ma'am, is that a hat,
or is your hair on fire?

1109
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,600
'Cause we can help you.
We have firemen

1110
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,656
standing right outside.
They can rush right in here,

1111
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,370
hose you down real quick,
free of charge.

1112
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:47,900
How's Chaim? How's my baby boy?

1113
00:41:48,100 --> 00:41:49,110
<i>Oh, he's just the greatest</i>

1114
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:50,570
<i>little man on the planet.</i>

1115
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:51,786
You should have seen
the other day,

1116
00:41:51,810 --> 00:41:53,090
he was playing
with a basketball,

1117
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:54,150
but he's so tiny,

1118
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,510
he rolled right over
the top of it

1119
00:41:55,610 --> 00:41:56,910
<i>and did a complete somersault.</i>

1120
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:58,540
I wish I'd seen that.

1121
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,716
The ball landed on top of him.
He never let go of it.

1122
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:01,740
It was too cute.

1123
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,420
Noah, listen, I'm calling
with a question,

1124
00:42:03,530 --> 00:42:04,670
then I'll let you go.

1125
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:06,830
- Sure.
- Could you order a quick raid on an enemy?

1126
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,380
- Pardon?
- <i>I know the CIA</i>

1127
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:11,970
is very busy. I wouldn't ask
if it wasn't important.

1128
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:15,050
Mom, what? I'm an analyst.
I've told you a million times.

1129
00:42:15,250 --> 00:42:16,650
<i>I wouldn't need to know
the details.</i>

1130
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:17,710
<i>I respect your privacy.</i>

1131
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:19,730
What enemy?
What are you talking about?

1132
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:23,440
It's this, uh, shall we say,
"coterie" I'm dealing with.

1133
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:26,570
I'm talking something fast,
unexpected, but severe.

1134
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,400
A very fast, hard attack.

1135
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,860
Well, short answer, Ma,
I cannot order a raid.

1136
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:33,126
Well, can I speak to someone
in the raid department, then?

1137
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,376
You could just
give me the number.

1138
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:35,680
We don't have a raid department.

1139
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:37,860
Ma, who the hell is this
"coterie" you want to raid?

1140
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:39,490
Just some women.

1141
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:41,210
They meet occasionally
in Coney Island,

1142
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,886
and I just thought,
if I knew they were there

1143
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:45,080
at a specific time, you could
firebomb it or something.

1144
00:42:45,280 --> 00:42:46,590
Ma, I'm at work.

1145
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,130
Perfect, can you ask
a colleague?

1146
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:50,300
They sometimes monitor
these calls, Ma.

1147
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:51,880
We cannot talk about this.

1148
00:42:52,080 --> 00:42:53,760
Oh. Well, should I
call back later?

1149
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:55,390
We could use a code word.

1150
00:42:55,590 --> 00:42:57,640
- How about "flower girl"?
- No!

1151
00:42:57,840 --> 00:43:00,060
Well, then should we meet
in the park at dusk?

1152
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:01,460
<i>I read about spies doing that.</i>

1153
00:43:01,630 --> 00:43:03,810
I really can't continue
this conversation.

1154
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:05,270
Oh, your father's home.

1155
00:43:05,470 --> 00:43:07,860
Abe, would you like
to say hi to Noah?

1156
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:09,150
Hi.

1157
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:10,826
<i>Pop, what the hell
is going on with...</i>

1158
00:43:10,850 --> 00:43:12,420
- Abe?
- Hi.

1159
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:15,200
Are you all right?

1160
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,620
Oh, I'm fine. Thank you.

1161
00:43:17,820 --> 00:43:19,790
How was your day? Did you

1162
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:22,540
make some good matches
at the tearoom?

1163
00:43:22,740 --> 00:43:25,170
Oh, yes. Yes, I, um,

1164
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:27,000
went to the tearoom.

1165
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,590
How was the tea?

1166
00:43:28,790 --> 00:43:31,210
It was very nice.

1167
00:43:31,410 --> 00:43:32,800
Corinne and I went there,

1168
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,800
and it was exactly
as it always is.

1169
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,800
- Very nice.
- That's nice.

1170
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,720
Mm. Did you have a nice day?

1171
00:43:39,920 --> 00:43:43,390
Just a... typical, nice Monday.

1172
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:46,770
Yeah, ate dessert at my desk,

1173
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:49,190
typed some, the usual.

1174
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:50,820
What did you have for dessert?

1175
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,240
Did I say dessert? Lunch.

1176
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:55,170
I ate lunch.

1177
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:01,620
You want to go out to dinner?

1178
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:04,500
<i>Rose, that's awful.</i>

1179
00:44:04,700 --> 00:44:07,370
I wasn't gonna tell you because
I didn't want to worry you.

1180
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:09,380
But it was just so upsetting,

1181
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:11,040
watching the place
burn like that.

1182
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:14,010
And the smell, oolong and ash.

1183
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:16,590
You know you can always
tell me anything.

1184
00:44:16,790 --> 00:44:20,180
The tearoom was my office.
I met all my clients there.

1185
00:44:20,380 --> 00:44:22,510
I don't know what
I'm gonna do without it.

1186
00:44:22,710 --> 00:44:25,810
The whole place smelled
like a... wedding cake.

1187
00:44:32,080 --> 00:44:34,740
Abe. What is this?

1188
00:44:34,930 --> 00:44:36,700
A fondly intentioned

1189
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:39,280
sexualized gesture.

1190
00:44:39,480 --> 00:44:41,380
Oh.

1191
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:46,290
Well, it is past 7:00.

1192
00:44:46,490 --> 00:44:49,080
Am I supposed to do
something in return?

1193
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:50,880
I think it's optional.

1194
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,850
Okay.

1195
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:05,470
- I told you there'd be drinks.
<i>- But it's okay</i>

1196
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:07,236
because your outfit
was made for sitting,

1197
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:08,890
and you sit in a bar, right?

1198
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:10,520
The flare can accommodate that?

1199
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,440
You know, I'm tired
of people mocking me

1200
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,110
for thinking about how a dress
works in different situations.

1201
00:45:15,310 --> 00:45:17,280
So, Toots Shor's
is their hangout, huh?

1202
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:19,450
They come here
because Gordon doesn't.

1203
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,200
He got into some fight
with Toots

1204
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:22,780
and won't set foot in the place.

1205
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:24,666
- They call it their sanctuary.
- <i>I got to start working</i>

1206
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:25,890
that place. It's a good place.

1207
00:45:25,940 --> 00:45:27,790
Susie...

1208
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:29,870
- the job is weird.
- How so?

1209
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:31,670
They don't think I'm funny.

1210
00:45:31,870 --> 00:45:32,870
Well, they don't have to,

1211
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:34,096
so long as Gordon
thinks you're funny.

1212
00:45:34,120 --> 00:45:35,550
The day felt like a week,

1213
00:45:35,750 --> 00:45:37,306
and we have to do it
all over again tomorrow

1214
00:45:37,330 --> 00:45:38,920
and then the next day
and the next.

1215
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:41,520
Well, you better not fucking
call me about tomorrow's outfit.

1216
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:42,580
I won't.

1217
00:45:42,750 --> 00:45:44,810
Now go mingle.
Make some friends.

1218
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,140
Be confident.
You love an audience.

1219
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:48,810
Think of those guys
as your audience.

1220
00:45:49,010 --> 00:45:50,980
- <i>Use 'em.</i>
- I'll try.

1221
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:53,080
- Bye.
- <i>Bye.</i>

1222
00:45:57,130 --> 00:45:58,990
rushes ahead of me
at the front of the line,

1223
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:01,740
buys the same can of tuna
every day,

1224
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:03,320
89 cents.

1225
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:04,780
She's counting out pennies.

1226
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:08,330
"One, two,
I lost my place, one, two..."

1227
00:46:08,530 --> 00:46:11,370
I'm going nuts.

1228
00:46:11,570 --> 00:46:12,790
Sure?

1229
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:14,630
Harvard did teach me
manners, after all.

1230
00:46:14,830 --> 00:46:17,210
Along with very useful Greek
and how to hit a shuttlecock.

1231
00:46:17,410 --> 00:46:20,170
There's not a bomb
underneath it, is there?

1232
00:46:20,370 --> 00:46:22,630
Are you kidding me?
Are you fucking kidding me?

1233
00:46:22,830 --> 00:46:24,010
He made peace with Toots?

1234
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:25,010
Not to my knowledge.

1235
00:46:25,210 --> 00:46:26,490
I personally
heard him call Toots

1236
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:28,010
a fat fuck not two weeks ago.

1237
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:29,236
They almost came to blows
that time.

1238
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:30,260
They had to be separated.

1239
00:46:30,340 --> 00:46:31,520
- What changed?
- Hey, all.

1240
00:46:31,720 --> 00:46:33,850
- Good show tonight.
- Hey.

1241
00:46:34,050 --> 00:46:35,410
Tough journey,
but we got it there.

1242
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,286
That's what Alvin's wife said
on their wedding night.

1243
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:38,860
Actually, she did.

1244
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,530
Wow.
So, Gordon,

1245
00:46:40,730 --> 00:46:42,916
- you like the automat joke?
- Mm, it wasn't my favorite.

1246
00:46:42,940 --> 00:46:45,120
- Good, it was Adam's.
- There's the guy.

1247
00:46:45,310 --> 00:46:47,120
It got a laugh.
Means it's funny.

1248
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:50,080
I'll tell you what's funny.
Mike got me an advanced copy

1249
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,006
of "The 2,000 Year Old Man,"
that Mel Brooks thing.

1250
00:46:52,030 --> 00:46:53,670
- Oh.
- Hilarious.

1251
00:46:53,860 --> 00:46:56,840
Really, really funny.

1252
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:58,030
One of the funniest...

1253
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:00,130
I never said Mel Brooks
wasn't funny.

1254
00:47:00,330 --> 00:47:03,010
But that bit would be nothing
without Carl Reiner.

1255
00:47:03,210 --> 00:47:05,266
Right, 'cause without Carl, it
would be Mel awkwardly waiting

1256
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:07,436
half a minute in silence and
then reciting the punch line.

1257
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,600
Yeah, that would stink.

1258
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:10,240
I give up.

1259
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:14,440
Hey.

1260
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:15,650
Hi.

1261
00:47:15,850 --> 00:47:17,130
How are these guys treating you?

1262
00:47:17,260 --> 00:47:18,320
Terrific.

1263
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:19,610
She lied.

1264
00:47:19,810 --> 00:47:21,250
They're a very good group
of writers,

1265
00:47:21,390 --> 00:47:24,200
and I am thrilled to be here.
Learning a lot.

1266
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:25,990
Pleasure's ours.

1267
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:29,410
They give you any problems,
you come to me.

1268
00:47:29,610 --> 00:47:31,410
Okay.

1269
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:33,046
All right, fellas,
I'm gonna grab a drink.

1270
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:34,176
- Next round's on me.
- Thanks.

1271
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:36,600
- You're too kind. - Thanks, boss.
- That's nice of you, boss.

1272
00:47:38,270 --> 00:47:40,210
What changed? That changed.

1273
00:47:40,410 --> 00:47:41,590
What?

1274
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:43,420
Everything was the same today,

1275
00:47:43,620 --> 00:47:44,800
except for the X factor.

1276
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,180
We just solved for "X."

1277
00:47:46,380 --> 00:47:48,350
"X"? I'm not "X."

1278
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:50,970
- Look at that.
- Good to see you back, Gordie.

1279
00:47:51,170 --> 00:47:53,026
- Ah, you're looking good, Toots.
- I always look good.

1280
00:47:53,050 --> 00:47:54,230
I'm gonna miss this place.

1281
00:47:54,430 --> 00:47:55,710
We can go back
to that Irish pub.

1282
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,826
I can't sit through that
tin whistle leprechaun music

1283
00:47:57,850 --> 00:47:58,900
anymore, I'll go crazy.

1284
00:47:59,100 --> 00:48:00,400
You can come back here.

1285
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:01,656
There's that place on 59th.

1286
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:03,070
I swear you can come back here.

1287
00:48:03,270 --> 00:48:04,270
What about PJ Clarke's?

1288
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:05,320
They measure their pours.

1289
00:48:05,520 --> 00:48:06,670
I'm not "X."

1290
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,720
<i>So, I started this new job,</i>

1291
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:36,850
and it's... not fun.

1292
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:39,150
Not that every job
is supposed to be fun. I mean,

1293
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:40,790
when a nurse
is inserting a catheter,

1294
00:48:40,850 --> 00:48:42,156
she's not standing
there thinking,

1295
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:44,020
"This looked so much more fun
in the brochure."

1296
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:49,200
And it's all men. Mm-hmm.

1297
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,490
So, I'm sitting in this room
with a bunch of men,

1298
00:48:51,690 --> 00:48:53,240
and none of them are being nice

1299
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,080
or showing me the ropes,

1300
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:57,410
and so far none of them
seem to want to sleep with me.

1301
00:48:59,240 --> 00:49:00,790
It's the least they could do.

1302
00:49:00,990 --> 00:49:03,670
Who raised these men,
not wolves?

1303
00:49:05,660 --> 00:49:08,170
Hey, did you hear there's gonna
be a baby in the White House?

1304
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:10,390
Little JFK Jr.

1305
00:49:10,580 --> 00:49:11,930
It'll be a clean transition.

1306
00:49:12,130 --> 00:49:13,276
White House staff
already learned how

1307
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:14,930
to change diapers
with Eisenhower.

1308
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:19,560
