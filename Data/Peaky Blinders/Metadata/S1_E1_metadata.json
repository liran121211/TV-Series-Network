Thomas, by mistake, appropriates a consignment of guns which have been stolen from the local arms factory and hard-nosed Inspector Campbell arrives from Ireland, charged by war minister Winston Churchill to recover it. Thomas's aunt Polly urges him to return it but he sees the opportunity to use it to his advantage. Thomas also quarrels with his elder brother Arthur as Thomas has devised the 'powder trick', a means of fixing horse races and Arthur is nervous as Thomas has not involved Billy Kimber, who runs the race-courses and their rackets. Thomas's sister Ada is in love with Freddie Thorne, who saved her brother's life in the war, and is now a Marxist, encouraging workers to strike over a pay cut. As far as Campbell is concerned Freddie is as much the enemy - in the wake of the Russian revolution - as the Peaky Blinders, as he looks for the missing guns.\u2014don @ minifie-1", "In 1919 the Peaky Blinders, an Irish-roots crime gang in Birmingham, led by Thomas \"Tommy\" Shelby, a decorated the Great War veteran sergeant major, control the horse race gambling and black market, but 'accidentally' appropriate a consignment of guns from the local arms factory destined for Lybia. War minister Winston Churchill sends Belfast Constabulary-veteran Inspector Chester Campbell to Birmingham to retrieve the guns. Tommy's aunt Polly urges Tommy to return the guns, which he promises, but he feels that he can use them to his advantage. His traditionalist brother Arthur does not agree with inventive Tommy about fixing horse races, believing it will cause trouble with Billy Kimber, who runs the races, as well as the Chinese coolie colony. Inspector Campbell and his men (alos protestants form Belfast) capture and torture Arthur inquiring about the gun robbery. Campbell propositions Arthur and the gang to work with him to find the guns. Tommy's sister Ada is involved with communist labor union leader Freddie Thorne, also a veteran. Barmaid Grace Burgess starts working at the Garrison, a bar owned by the Peaky Blinders, but was planted in Birmingham by Campbell as spy. Tommy's friend Danny has a PTSD episode and kills an Italian business owner. To avoid a war with the Italians, Tommy agrees to execute Danny, with the Italians witnessing, but the shot is staged and Danny goes to London on a special assignment.\u2014KGF Vissers"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "2471500", "rating": 8.0, "votes": 15007, "number_of_episodes": 36}
