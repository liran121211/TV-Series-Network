At a country fair outside the city Thomas gets into a fight with the Lees, a violent family of travellers, who later send him a bullet with his name on, giving him another adversary to rank alongside Billy Kimber. Campbell sends a message to Thomas via Aunt Polly and they meet on neutral ground at a hotel. Thomas proposes to Campbell that if he leaves him alone he will return the guns. If he is arrested the guns will be sent to the IRA in Ireland. If not the weapons will be given to Campbell to make him appear a hero. Campbell is unhappy but reluctantly agrees.

Freddie, however, decides to stay and face him.\u2014don @ minifie-1", "After Campbell's protestant cohort brutally searches the Catholic church, Thomas's Aunt Polly blames him to confront an enemy too large, as with Kimber, but is duly laughed away.

Sister Ada is rescued from a raid on Communists by lover Freddie Thorne, Thomas's craziest comrade in arms, who makes a run for it, turns out the father of her baby and returns to wed her.
