They both know that Grace has married and is in America. Thomas writes to Winston Churchill, asking for an export licence, which is granted as another means of controlling him and he goes to London, hoping to ally with Alfie Solomons, leader of the Jewish race track gang, who is anything but welcoming. He does however encounter Ada, who has been rescued by the Blinders, and, as a means of laundering money, buys her a house. Back in Birmingham he has to cover for increasingly unhinged older brother Arthur, haunted by the war, when he kills an opponent in the boxing ring. Thomas is able to discover what happened to Polly's children. The girl died but he locates the boy, Michael, who arrives in Birmingham to see her.\u2014don @ minifie-1"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "3683570", "rating": 8.2, "votes": 9865, "number_of_episodes": 36}
