1
00:00:00,572 --> 00:00:03,912
- Where do you keep these things? Bank?
- We have our own treasury.

2
00:00:03,962 --> 00:00:06,332
- Wine cellar.
- And a tunnel under the river.

3
00:00:06,382 --> 00:00:09,212
My guess is they've turned one
of the cellars into a strong room.

4
00:00:09,262 --> 00:00:10,692
Did you find someone, Arthur?

5
00:00:10,742 --> 00:00:12,532
Stefan Radischevky.

6
00:00:12,582 --> 00:00:14,012
- And he speaks Russian?
- Yeah.

7
00:00:14,062 --> 00:00:17,372
He works in the house for four
weeks, keeps his ears open.

8
00:00:17,422 --> 00:00:18,572
All right?

9
00:00:18,622 --> 00:00:21,172
I have a bright future too...

10
00:00:21,222 --> 00:00:22,732
mapped out.

11
00:00:22,782 --> 00:00:24,612
But you want to try things first?

12
00:00:24,662 --> 00:00:26,892
Michael...

13
00:00:26,942 --> 00:00:30,492
why does a pen pusher who
sits on his arse all day

14
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:32,372
want to fire a gun?

15
00:00:32,422 --> 00:00:36,292
There's going to be a vacancy
at Shelby Company Limited.

16
00:00:36,342 --> 00:00:37,612
No revolvers, all legal.

17
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:40,902
Get me a meeting with someone
from the Soviet embassy...

18
00:00:52,462 --> 00:00:57,812
♪ Look up here, I'm in heaven

19
00:00:57,862 --> 00:01:01,662
♪ I've got scars that can't be seen

20
00:01:05,262 --> 00:01:09,702
♪ I've got drama, can't be stolen

21
00:01:12,622 --> 00:01:16,582
♪ Everybody knows me now. ♪

22
00:01:25,102 --> 00:01:28,252
He was in the war.

23
00:01:28,302 --> 00:01:32,652
He was in a tunnel collapse.

24
00:01:32,702 --> 00:01:37,332
He won medals.

25
00:01:37,382 --> 00:01:39,742
Take care of him.

26
00:01:49,702 --> 00:01:53,382
♪ Look up here, man, I'm in danger

27
00:01:57,102 --> 00:02:00,902
♪ I've got nothing left to lose

28
00:02:04,022 --> 00:02:08,022

00:02:31,702 --> 00:02:33,842
Here he is, Mr Shelby.

31
00:02:35,742 --> 00:02:37,612
Thank you, nurse.

32
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,142
Tommy...

33
00:02:47,302 --> 00:02:50,302
I need to speak to you about the priest.

34
00:02:54,462 --> 00:02:55,932
I know things about him.

35
00:02:55,982 --> 00:02:57,252
Hmmm.

36
00:02:59,542 --> 00:03:02,702
From when I was a...
from when I was a boy.

37
00:03:11,062 --> 00:03:13,862
I will shoot him myself, Tommy.

38
00:03:15,982 --> 00:03:18,382
Just teach me how to shoot.

39
00:03:21,462 --> 00:03:23,462
It's easy, Michael.

40
00:03:24,822 --> 00:03:28,142
Just point... pull the trigger.

41
00:04:57,662 --> 00:05:00,702
He asked for me today, Mary...

42
00:05:02,462 --> 00:05:04,532
.. not his mother...

43
00:05:05,422 --> 00:05:07,562
.. for the first time.

44
00:05:08,062 --> 00:05:09,802
He missed you.

45
00:05:10,302 --> 00:05:12,252
Where is he? Is he in the kitchen?

46
00:05:12,302 --> 00:05:15,242
Yes, he's with the girls and Johnny.

47
00:05:20,062 --> 00:05:23,002
Did you remember your medicine, sir?

48
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:27,522
Do you ever read the Bible, Mary?

49
00:05:28,422 --> 00:05:29,652
Sometimes.

50
00:05:29,702 --> 00:05:33,382
Do you ever read it out loud while
standing naked, next to my bed?

51
00:05:35,942 --> 00:05:40,732
Cos... when I take the morphine the
doctor gave me, that's what you do.

52
00:05:40,782 --> 00:05:45,772
I'm wide awake but you are
standing there naked, plain as day,

53
00:05:45,822 --> 00:05:49,182
reading from the Book Of Leviticus.

54
00:05:52,022 --> 00:05:55,022
Do you want to know what happens next?

55
00:05:56,862 --> 00:05:58,862
No... neither do I.

56
00:06:01,502 --> 00:06:05,492
That's why I pour the medicine away.

57
00:06:05,542 --> 00:06:07,812
Go and get Johnny, Mary.

58
00:06:41,702 --> 00:06:44,412
Without the firing pins,
the guns won't work.

59
00:06:44,462 --> 00:06:45,892
And there are no replacements?

60
00:06:45,942 --> 00:06:49,772
They don't make these anymore,
these are the end of the line.

61
00:06:49,822 --> 00:06:52,292
We had the foreman take
out all the spares.

62
00:06:52,342 --> 00:06:55,372
Take the pins, they'll never fire a shot.

63
00:06:55,422 --> 00:06:59,412
Nobody will know until they unload
the bloody things in Tbilisi.

64
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:02,092
Or until they are facing
our guns at Kutaisi.

65
00:07:02,142 --> 00:07:04,132
Take them all out and give them to me.

66
00:07:04,182 --> 00:07:05,532
Come on, boys, no fucking about.

67
00:07:05,582 --> 00:07:08,052
I will tell the Soviet
Ambassador that there is no longer

68
00:07:08,102 --> 00:07:09,372
a need to blow up the train.

69
00:07:09,422 --> 00:07:12,522
I will tell Tommy, you accept his plan.

70
00:07:17,182 --> 00:07:19,972
You know, some mornings I
wake up, I think I've died

71
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,932
and this is heaven, Tom.

72
00:07:22,982 --> 00:07:26,492
I mean, the wives and the
kids camped out by the valley,

73
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:27,932
not being moved on.

74
00:07:27,982 --> 00:07:33,182
Sure, me, meself, I'm surrounded
by maids and food and booze.

75
00:07:35,942 --> 00:07:38,082
See that line, there?

76
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:42,132
No.

77
00:07:42,182 --> 00:07:44,452
That's the edge of heaven.

78
00:07:44,502 --> 00:07:48,502
The border between
Birmingham and paradise.

79
00:07:50,702 --> 00:07:54,662
And today, my friend, you're
going to step over that line,

80
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,012
back into the world.

81
00:07:58,222 --> 00:08:01,722
You mean you have something
for me to do, Tom?

82
00:08:02,702 --> 00:08:05,742
Have you ever heard of
Hampton Court Palace, Johnny?

83
00:08:06,742 --> 00:08:08,812
No. I can't say I have.

84
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:11,772
You and three families of the
Lees are going to set up camp

85
00:08:11,822 --> 00:08:14,532
100 yards from the gates of the palace.

86
00:08:14,582 --> 00:08:17,452
You won't be moved on because
I have just bought the land.

87
00:08:17,502 --> 00:08:19,492
You'll be joined by
some old friends of mine

88
00:08:19,542 --> 00:08:24,412
who are going to open a hole
underneath your tents and caravans.

89
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:26,332
You see this blow to the
head you took, Tom...

90
00:08:26,382 --> 00:08:30,052
And for allowing the hole to
be dug, you will get £5,000.

91
00:08:30,102 --> 00:08:33,822
Which you will split between
the three Lee families.

92
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:39,142
I take a lot of this money is to
do with not asking questions, Tommy?

93
00:08:41,222 --> 00:08:42,572
Dead right, Johnny.

94
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:46,702
And when the hole is filled in
again, you can go back to paradise.

95
00:08:51,662 --> 00:08:54,462
Mr Shelby, your brothers are here.

96
00:08:55,782 --> 00:09:00,302
And there's someone who described
himself as, "the wandering Jew".

97
00:09:02,942 --> 00:09:08,852
Will you take the Jewish
gentleman to the drawing room

98
00:09:08,902 --> 00:09:12,572
and take my brothers to the
kitchen and give them tea and rum?

99
00:09:12,622 --> 00:09:14,092
Yes, sir.

100
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:26,702
Good morning, Mr Solomons.

101
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:28,612
Yeah, it is.

102
00:09:30,942 --> 00:09:34,252
Nice little place you've got here, Thomas.

103
00:09:34,302 --> 00:09:35,452
What is it?

104
00:09:35,502 --> 00:09:39,172
A foreclosure of a gambling debt
from some poor young lord who

105
00:09:39,222 --> 00:09:42,532
you pumped full of opium
in one of your casinos?

106
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:43,972
Or is that just tittle-tattle?

107
00:09:44,022 --> 00:09:46,372
No. Drink?

108
00:09:46,422 --> 00:09:47,932
Nah, I don't touch it, mate.

109
00:09:47,982 --> 00:09:52,542
Your housekeeper said you're
not allowed to drink. Eh?

110
00:09:53,742 --> 00:09:58,332
She said, you are suffering
from so many ancient injuries

111
00:09:58,382 --> 00:10:01,292
from your sporting life
that your head is like some

112
00:10:01,342 --> 00:10:05,502
sort of smashed vase what's been
stuck back together by an horse.

113
00:10:08,862 --> 00:10:13,012
Now... word in London
is that you can be found

114
00:10:13,062 --> 00:10:17,332
wandering the streets of Birmingham,
stark naked, throwing away money.

115
00:10:17,382 --> 00:10:19,492
You talk to dead people.

116
00:10:19,542 --> 00:10:26,742
Also, that you believe that you
are powerful enough to summon up

117
00:10:27,902 --> 00:10:34,852
Jews of a very particular standing
up to the gentile wilderness

118
00:10:34,902 --> 00:10:39,252
wherein you live in order for them
to do your fucking bidding, mate.

119
00:10:39,302 --> 00:10:40,852
And still, you came.

120
00:10:40,902 --> 00:10:44,602
Yeah, well, you know...
I was passing, weren't I?

121
00:10:47,822 --> 00:10:49,492
Do you know something, Alfie?

122
00:10:49,542 --> 00:10:55,492
This morning, I tried to read the
paper and I realised that the

123
00:10:55,542 --> 00:11:00,102
only consequence of my terrible
accident is that I now need glasses.

124
00:11:04,462 --> 00:11:05,862
Right...

125
00:11:08,902 --> 00:11:12,702
Right, well, I know a man...

126
00:11:14,222 --> 00:11:16,972
.. who can make you a pair of these,

127
00:11:17,022 --> 00:11:19,332
he is a magician, mate.

128
00:11:19,382 --> 00:11:21,252
He is a magician.

129
00:11:22,062 --> 00:11:26,172
So, not only will you be
able to read your newspaper,

130
00:11:26,222 --> 00:11:31,782
but you will also be able
to see into the future.

131
00:11:34,102 --> 00:11:38,582
Now, I know this, right, because
he made this pair, here, for me.

132
00:11:40,342 --> 00:11:42,372
So, you don't have to
worry about telling me

133
00:11:42,422 --> 00:11:46,462
what this is all about, do you?
Because I have already seen it.

134
00:11:56,142 --> 00:12:00,212
You're fucking about with
Russians, in't you? You silly boy.

135
00:12:00,262 --> 00:12:02,772
Right, you've got two choices, Michael.

136
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:05,732
You fuck off to America with
Arthur, join the Apaches,

137
00:12:05,782 --> 00:12:07,092
or you marry the girl.

138
00:12:07,142 --> 00:12:08,812
This isn't a joke.

139
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:11,732
Arthur, are you really going
to live with the Apaches?

140
00:12:11,782 --> 00:12:14,292
- Told her father yet?
- No.

141
00:12:14,342 --> 00:12:15,812
He'll fucking shoot you, man.

142
00:12:15,862 --> 00:12:17,132
Are you sure the kid's yours?

143
00:12:17,182 --> 00:12:19,172
I wish I hadn't told you.

144
00:12:19,222 --> 00:12:22,692
Then think of marriage
as a beautiful road...

145
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,372
flowers all the way down it.

146
00:12:24,422 --> 00:12:25,812
Is he joking?

147
00:12:25,862 --> 00:12:28,402
It's hard to tell these days.

148
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:32,932
Do you, er...

149
00:12:32,982 --> 00:12:35,122
Do you love the woman?

150
00:12:36,742 --> 00:12:38,012
Fucking what?

151
00:12:38,062 --> 00:12:39,652
Go and marry her, like the rest of us.

152
00:12:39,702 --> 00:12:42,052
She doesn't want her family to know.

153
00:12:42,102 --> 00:12:43,652
She doesn't want to have the baby.

154
00:12:43,702 --> 00:12:45,692
- We know a woman...
- Shut up, John.

155
00:12:45,742 --> 00:12:47,772
Same woman who helped you out twice.

156
00:12:47,822 --> 00:12:49,572
They weren't my women.

157
00:12:49,622 --> 00:12:51,612
That's why you had them fixed, Arthur.

158
00:12:51,662 --> 00:12:53,132
Charlotte will want the best.

159
00:12:53,182 --> 00:12:54,612
- She is the best.
- The best.

160
00:12:54,662 --> 00:12:56,012
Used to be a nurse.

161
00:12:56,062 --> 00:12:57,332
20 minutes, done.

162
00:12:57,382 --> 00:13:00,412
Don't have to go in, or wait outside.

163
00:13:00,462 --> 00:13:04,212
You go to the Garrison,
drink whisky, have a laugh.

164
00:13:04,262 --> 00:13:06,252
Remember, John?

165
00:13:06,302 --> 00:13:10,732
Then this kid walks in, no shoes
on, and says, "It's done".

166
00:13:10,782 --> 00:13:12,332
Second time we was in there...

167
00:13:12,382 --> 00:13:16,742
same kid, this time he's
wearing shiny new shoes.

168
00:13:18,662 --> 00:13:21,052
And he shouts, "It's done, Arthur."

169
00:13:21,102 --> 00:13:22,582
And what?

170
00:13:25,582 --> 00:13:27,782
She bought new shoes...

171
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:31,682
.. with the money I gave her.

172
00:13:32,982 --> 00:13:34,812
It was for a good cause.

173
00:13:34,862 --> 00:13:38,132
Arthur... If you're going to get
on like this with the Apaches,

174
00:13:38,182 --> 00:13:40,782
they'd fucking scalp you, boy.

175
00:13:42,302 --> 00:13:45,782
Tommy said when that bell rings
we've to all go to the big room.

176
00:13:51,702 --> 00:13:54,102
Come on. Tommy has a plan.

177
00:14:11,302 --> 00:14:12,772
Arthur.

178
00:14:12,822 --> 00:14:13,812
Arthur.

179
00:14:13,862 --> 00:14:15,802
Arthur, come here.

180
00:14:16,502 --> 00:14:19,292
Shalom!

181
00:14:19,342 --> 00:14:21,142
Arthur, shalom!

182
00:14:22,062 --> 00:14:23,212
Alfie.

183
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:26,492
Shalom. Come here. Come on, listen...

184
00:14:26,542 --> 00:14:28,332
I owe you a little something, don't I?

185
00:14:28,382 --> 00:14:31,852
I do. Come on. Sit down.

186
00:14:31,902 --> 00:14:33,572
Come on, sit down here.

187
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:35,612
There you go.

188
00:14:35,662 --> 00:14:38,212
Right...

189
00:14:38,262 --> 00:14:39,772
Listen...

190
00:14:39,822 --> 00:14:41,292
Arthur...

191
00:14:42,662 --> 00:14:43,932
I want you to know, right?

192
00:14:43,982 --> 00:14:46,452
That whatever happened between us, yeah?

193
00:14:46,502 --> 00:14:49,812
Back then... that was business.

194
00:14:49,862 --> 00:14:52,532
It was just business. All right?

195
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:57,852
And I also want you to know
that I have made my apologies

196
00:14:57,902 --> 00:15:04,692
via my own God for abusing a very
holy day to get you clinked up

197
00:15:04,742 --> 00:15:07,212
and battered, which I did.

198
00:15:07,262 --> 00:15:12,822
And now, I would also like to extend
my personal apologies unto you.

199
00:15:22,222 --> 00:15:23,762
All right?

200
00:15:25,862 --> 00:15:30,262
I hear that you have allowed
Jesus to come into your life.

201
00:15:31,422 --> 00:15:32,772
You heard, then?

202
00:15:32,822 --> 00:15:34,692
Yeah, that's beautiful. That's wonderful.

203
00:15:34,742 --> 00:15:38,212
Now, that's lovely, isn't
it? That's... that's lovely.

204
00:15:38,262 --> 00:15:41,212
But I was wondering, how
does that work for you on a

205
00:15:41,262 --> 00:15:44,862
day-to-day, considering
your line of work, mate?

206
00:15:48,662 --> 00:15:50,932
Your apology's accepted.

207
00:15:53,422 --> 00:15:57,222
Cos I hear you're a right
fucking nuisance with it.

208
00:15:58,982 --> 00:16:00,382
Hello...

209
00:16:01,302 --> 00:16:05,292
You see, all I'm saying is that
every man, he craves certainty.

210
00:16:05,342 --> 00:16:07,972
Don't he? He craves the certainty,

211
00:16:08,022 --> 00:16:11,652
even if that certainty of yours, right...?

212
00:16:11,702 --> 00:16:16,422
Well, I mean... it's fucking
fanciful, mate, in't it?

213
00:16:18,782 --> 00:16:20,022
Eh?

214
00:16:32,022 --> 00:16:35,702
I'm Old Testament.

215
00:16:37,702 --> 00:16:40,702
Fucking hell. Look at that. Now, that...

216
00:16:41,782 --> 00:16:44,982
.. that scares me more. Yeah.

217
00:16:46,142 --> 00:16:47,772
Congratulations, Tommy.

218
00:16:47,822 --> 00:16:51,132
You now have the finished
article right there, don't you?

219
00:16:51,182 --> 00:16:54,852
See, that man, right, he
will murder and maim for you

220
00:16:54,902 --> 00:16:57,042
with God on his side.

221
00:16:58,102 --> 00:16:59,702
Yeah.

222
00:17:02,822 --> 00:17:05,362
You don't want to let him go.

223
00:17:06,222 --> 00:17:10,662
If we're going to do business with
this fucker, I demand to know why.

224
00:17:15,262 --> 00:17:17,012
Right...

225
00:17:17,062 --> 00:17:21,102
While I was in the hospital,
I formulated a plan

226
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:27,412
and this is how it's going to work...

227
00:17:27,462 --> 00:17:31,052
So, the Russians cannot
be trusted to pay us.

228
00:17:31,102 --> 00:17:33,902
we are going to take what is ours.

229
00:17:34,662 --> 00:17:37,662
We need to see what's in their treasury.

230
00:17:37,942 --> 00:17:41,102
And that's why we need Mr Solomons.

231
00:18:02,382 --> 00:18:08,692
Right boys, just remember
they are fucking insane...

232
00:18:08,742 --> 00:18:10,852
and dangerous.

233
00:18:10,902 --> 00:18:13,692
And drunk on stuff we've never heard of.

234
00:18:13,742 --> 00:18:17,442
And they're worse than
us for spirits and ghosts.

235
00:18:19,502 --> 00:18:22,442
And today, they're going to test us.

236
00:18:24,142 --> 00:18:25,942
Fuck them.

237
00:18:32,782 --> 00:18:36,772
The Russians all turned and ran.

238
00:18:36,822 --> 00:18:39,492
The Cossacks didn't run, Arthur.

239
00:18:51,262 --> 00:18:53,812
Mr Shelby, welcome.

240
00:18:53,862 --> 00:18:55,132
How is my car?

241
00:18:55,182 --> 00:18:57,132
I think I'm in love with it.

242
00:18:57,182 --> 00:19:01,172
And I, yours. So, we should
keep what we love, yes?

243
00:19:01,222 --> 00:19:03,652
Excuse the reception.
Whenever we open the treasury,

244
00:19:03,702 --> 00:19:06,102
the Cossacks are on guard.

245
00:19:13,812 --> 00:19:14,812
'In Russia,

246
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:19,572
'men on the other side of the law
decorate their body in tattoos.'

247
00:19:19,622 --> 00:19:20,972
- Right.
- Right.

248
00:19:21,022 --> 00:19:25,012
Now, some of these tattoos are
proof of allegiance to underground

249
00:19:25,062 --> 00:19:31,092
organisations, which are the sworn
enemies of the Royal household.

250
00:19:31,142 --> 00:19:37,012
So, it's customary in Russian
Royal households to check for such

251
00:19:37,062 --> 00:19:39,732
tattoos before engaging a man in business.

252
00:19:39,782 --> 00:19:42,772
And as we approach the
allotted day, these ladies here

253
00:19:42,822 --> 00:19:46,492
would like to make sure that you're
not assassins or infiltrators...

254
00:19:46,542 --> 00:19:47,852
No, we're all good.

255
00:19:47,902 --> 00:19:51,612
So, they'd like to check your skin.

256
00:19:51,662 --> 00:19:54,132
They want to check our skin?

257
00:19:54,782 --> 00:19:57,412
Yeah. Now my body's already been checked.

258
00:19:57,462 --> 00:20:00,532
Although, at the time, I
wasn't sure that was the reason.

259
00:20:00,582 --> 00:20:03,172
And now it's your turn.

260
00:20:03,222 --> 00:20:05,292
Come on, boys.

261
00:20:05,342 --> 00:20:07,482
Take your clothes off.

262
00:20:08,062 --> 00:20:09,892
Fuck off.

263
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:11,852
No, no, no, no, no, no.

264
00:20:11,902 --> 00:20:13,452
Obey.

265
00:20:13,502 --> 00:20:14,852
That's it...

266
00:20:14,902 --> 00:20:17,572
Obey, Arthur.

267
00:20:17,622 --> 00:20:20,972
No, I won't be obeying nobody.
Get out of my way, I'm leaving.

268
00:20:21,022 --> 00:20:23,092
Arthur, come here...

269
00:20:40,222 --> 00:20:42,612
Come on, Arthur.

270
00:20:42,662 --> 00:20:44,422
Shut up, John.

271
00:20:45,822 --> 00:20:52,142
I will have a maid gather the
buttons and sew them back on.

272
00:21:05,262 --> 00:21:08,532
Right. Fuck it.

273
00:21:08,582 --> 00:21:10,332
There you go, ladies.

274
00:21:10,382 --> 00:21:13,782
Made in fucking Birmingham.

275
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,982
All right, I think we've seen enough, eh?

276
00:21:18,822 --> 00:21:21,022
Tatiana...

277
00:21:25,822 --> 00:21:28,292
Your face, Arthur, is a fucking picture.

278
00:21:28,342 --> 00:21:32,102
Sometimes assassins hide their
allegiances behind their balls.

279
00:21:37,942 --> 00:21:43,222
You pass the test, soldier,
with flying colours.

280
00:21:55,662 --> 00:21:59,412
You see...

281
00:21:59,462 --> 00:22:01,942
He wants to be a good man.

282
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:12,012
But there now.

283
00:22:12,062 --> 00:22:13,402
There.

284
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:19,982
Inside every man, there is a devil.

285
00:22:38,222 --> 00:22:40,452
The real diamonds, eh?

286
00:22:40,502 --> 00:22:46,212
It is traditional to seal the
successful examination with

287
00:22:46,262 --> 00:22:48,132
vodka and music.

288
00:22:53,822 --> 00:22:56,572
Holy fuck, Tommo, what was that?

289
00:22:56,622 --> 00:22:58,692
Well done, boys. Eh?

290
00:22:59,422 --> 00:23:01,362
Well done, Arthur.

291
00:23:03,262 --> 00:23:06,382
Now you know what you
have to do next. All right?

292
00:23:07,942 --> 00:23:09,212
One last job.

293
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:12,262
Make contact and play nice.

294
00:23:23,262 --> 00:23:24,932
Five minutes.

295
00:23:27,702 --> 00:23:31,892
I brought Michael because as chief
accountant, he has to be witness.

296
00:23:31,942 --> 00:23:33,772
Ada, can I... can I use your phone?

297
00:23:33,822 --> 00:23:37,902
Michael, business first.

298
00:23:54,902 --> 00:23:57,842
Michael, stop looking at your watch.

299
00:24:00,662 --> 00:24:05,052
Ada, whilst you're reading this,
can I go and use your phone?

300
00:24:05,102 --> 00:24:06,652
Who's the lucky girl, Michael?

301
00:24:06,702 --> 00:24:09,372
Her name is Charlotte and
Michael cannot breathe

302
00:24:09,422 --> 00:24:12,012
if he does not talk to
her every two hours!

303
00:24:12,062 --> 00:24:14,252
Ada, please...

304
00:24:14,302 --> 00:24:16,412
Phone's in the hall.
Dial nought for the line.

305
00:24:16,462 --> 00:24:17,492
Thank you.

306
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:19,332
And keep it quick, I pay the bill.

307
00:24:19,382 --> 00:24:20,372
I will.

308
00:24:20,422 --> 00:24:22,092
Not for long!

309
00:24:40,342 --> 00:24:43,452
Think about it, Pol,
together we can take control.

310
00:24:43,502 --> 00:24:46,252
With two of us in the company,
we can straighten things out.

311
00:24:46,302 --> 00:24:47,532
What about the politics?

312
00:24:47,582 --> 00:24:51,532
You and me fighting together
and winning, that is politics.

313
00:24:51,582 --> 00:24:54,182
That's a new kind of politics.

314
00:24:54,302 --> 00:24:58,222
It's just this way, I get paid
and Karl gets a nice Christmas.

315
00:24:59,422 --> 00:25:02,162
Good. Welcome to the Bourgeoisie.

316
00:25:05,902 --> 00:25:07,772
My name is Smith.

317
00:25:09,222 --> 00:25:11,892
My girlfriend is... is pregnant.

318
00:25:12,702 --> 00:25:16,222
And, er... we'd like you to help us.

319
00:25:20,262 --> 00:25:22,402
We need to fix a date.

320
00:25:28,062 --> 00:25:30,862
Welcome to Shelby Company Limited.

321
00:25:31,342 --> 00:25:33,612
Shelby Company Limited.

322
00:25:33,662 --> 00:25:37,172
Limited and unarmed.

323
00:25:37,222 --> 00:25:41,652
Michael, would you like to welcome
Ada, our new Head of Property

324
00:25:41,702 --> 00:25:42,972
and Acquisitions.

325
00:25:43,022 --> 00:25:45,762
Congratulations. Where do I sign?

326
00:25:52,022 --> 00:25:55,532
Ada, have you got... um... whisky?

327
00:25:55,582 --> 00:25:57,252
Yeah, Tommy.

328
00:26:01,902 --> 00:26:03,732
I've already told him.

329
00:26:03,782 --> 00:26:05,372
He's becoming too like his cousin.

330
00:26:05,422 --> 00:26:06,852
I thought that was the idea.

331
00:26:06,902 --> 00:26:10,212
Yeah, Tommy but with a bit
more fucking charm and class.

332
00:26:10,262 --> 00:26:12,892
- Yeah.
- Oh, that'll help(!)

333
00:26:12,942 --> 00:26:14,732
Yep. Where am I sleeping, Ada?

334
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:16,932
- Michael...
- In the room next to Karl's.

335
00:26:16,982 --> 00:26:19,932
- Michael...
- Good night!

336
00:26:19,982 --> 00:26:22,382
Oh. Heartbroken, poor love.

337
00:26:23,942 --> 00:26:25,572
So how shall we celebrate?

338
00:26:25,622 --> 00:26:28,662
Well, with Michael in
bed, I thought I might...

339
00:26:30,182 --> 00:26:32,092
.. go for a little drive.

340
00:26:32,142 --> 00:26:35,212
A drive? Where are you going to drive?

341
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:36,412
Polly?

342
00:26:36,462 --> 00:26:39,572
Things have begun to develop with
the man who's painting my portrait.

343
00:26:39,622 --> 00:26:40,962
Polly?

344
00:26:42,662 --> 00:26:45,702
It's when you stand there in the dress...

345
00:26:47,142 --> 00:26:50,212
.. you just find yourself talking
about every little thing.

346
00:26:50,262 --> 00:26:53,132
- And have you...?
- No.

347
00:26:53,182 --> 00:26:55,092
Not yet.

348
00:26:55,142 --> 00:26:58,852
But he called me two nights ago to
say the portrait was finished and

349
00:26:58,902 --> 00:27:01,172
I said I'd go there in the morning

350
00:27:01,222 --> 00:27:04,522
but he said, no, he
wanted me there tonight.

351
00:27:10,942 --> 00:27:14,012
Ada, you don't breathe a fucking
word of this to the boys.

352
00:27:14,062 --> 00:27:16,692
- OK, but is he nice to you?
- No. No. I mean it, Ada.

353
00:27:16,742 --> 00:27:18,172
Is he rich?

354
00:27:18,222 --> 00:27:21,372
His friends write the papers, Ada.

355
00:27:21,422 --> 00:27:23,852
Tommy would try and close him down.

356
00:27:23,902 --> 00:27:25,892
So go.

357
00:27:25,942 --> 00:27:29,042
He's like a tiny bird pecking at you...

358
00:27:31,102 --> 00:27:33,972
.. and I think he's given up on me.

359
00:27:35,662 --> 00:27:37,332
So bloody go.

360
00:27:43,822 --> 00:27:46,762
Why should the boys have all the fun?

361
00:27:53,542 --> 00:27:55,942
♪ Baby did a bad, bad thing

362
00:27:56,782 --> 00:27:59,182
♪ Baby did a bad, bad thing

363
00:28:08,782 --> 00:28:11,062
♪ I feel like crying

364
00:28:12,742 --> 00:28:15,102
♪ I feel like dying... ♪

365
00:28:16,182 --> 00:28:17,652
More vodka.

366
00:28:17,702 --> 00:28:20,302
♪ Baby did a bad, bad thing. ♪

367
00:28:38,022 --> 00:28:39,622
Don't move.

368
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:46,222
Wait there.

369
00:28:50,502 --> 00:28:52,902
You're doing good, Stefan.

370
00:28:55,142 --> 00:28:58,652
- It's a fucking mad house.
- Yeah, I know.

371
00:28:58,702 --> 00:29:01,642
The Prince wants me to suck his cock.

372
00:29:02,262 --> 00:29:04,612
And how much would you need to say yes?

373
00:29:04,662 --> 00:29:08,362
That's on top of the day
rate for the arse slaps.

374
00:29:11,222 --> 00:29:12,972
When am I out of here?

375
00:29:13,022 --> 00:29:14,532
Soon.

376
00:29:14,582 --> 00:29:16,252
What you got?

377
00:29:19,262 --> 00:29:21,772
The strong room's not
guarded at night, but

378
00:29:21,822 --> 00:29:24,612
they said they would kill the three
brothers in the "uglya dvor" --

379
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:26,532
coal yard.

380
00:29:26,582 --> 00:29:29,292
The Duke was talking about
using a sword but the woman,

381
00:29:29,342 --> 00:29:32,342
she was talking about using machine guns.

382
00:29:43,302 --> 00:29:45,972
It's a fucking mad house, John.

383
00:29:46,742 --> 00:29:50,132
We're doing up your pub in Nechells.

384
00:29:50,182 --> 00:29:52,052
It looks a treat.

385
00:29:54,382 --> 00:29:57,382
Keep your fucking head up, Peaky boy, eh?

386
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:06,102
Fucking mad house, man.

387
00:30:08,062 --> 00:30:10,662
We are almost there. This way.

388
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:19,852
This treasury was built
200 years ago to protect

389
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:23,302
the King's jewels in
case of French invasion.

390
00:30:27,942 --> 00:30:30,942
We are now underneath the River Thames...

391
00:30:56,502 --> 00:30:58,732
Your jeweller.

392
00:30:58,782 --> 00:31:01,572
I don't think they trust me, Tommy.

393
00:31:01,622 --> 00:31:04,332
Mr Solomons is the only
jeweller I trust in London.

394
00:31:04,382 --> 00:31:08,302
Yes, trust. Yes. Might have to
add that on the old invoice.

395
00:31:09,942 --> 00:31:11,132
Thank you. Thank you.

396
00:31:11,182 --> 00:31:13,812
As we agreed, your jeweller
will now select items

397
00:31:13,862 --> 00:31:16,732
to a total value of £70,000.

398
00:31:16,782 --> 00:31:18,612
When you have selected your chosen items,

399
00:31:18,662 --> 00:31:20,692
they will be put into a box and stored.

400
00:31:20,742 --> 00:31:22,772
When you have fulfilled
your part of the deal,

401
00:31:22,822 --> 00:31:25,562
the box will be delivered to you.

402
00:31:28,982 --> 00:31:33,292
May I just start, right, by saying
that I may choose to stay here

403
00:31:33,342 --> 00:31:36,852
and just starve to death
and choke on sapphires

404
00:31:36,902 --> 00:31:40,802
rather than ever go back
to the fucking world again?

405
00:31:41,382 --> 00:31:44,092
Yeah, well, there is a good reason
for that, you know, little man.

406
00:31:44,142 --> 00:31:47,532
Because my shop, right, is just
above a rum house, so all the...

407
00:31:47,582 --> 00:31:49,612
- You speak Russian?
- I do, yeah. I do.

408
00:31:49,662 --> 00:31:53,612
Cos of me mum. Yeah, my mother.

409
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:55,852
You people, all right,

410
00:31:55,902 --> 00:31:59,172
you hunted my mum...

411
00:31:59,222 --> 00:32:01,372
with dogs...

412
00:32:01,422 --> 00:32:03,292
through the snow.

413
00:32:05,022 --> 00:32:06,292
Yeah.

414
00:32:07,742 --> 00:32:12,812
But today, right, is for
forgiveness, ain't it?

415
00:32:12,862 --> 00:32:14,602
For selection.

416
00:32:15,742 --> 00:32:17,862
So, now...

417
00:32:19,022 --> 00:32:20,972
Hello...

418
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:24,732
Right. I think it's
fair to say, yeah, 1,500.

419
00:32:24,782 --> 00:32:25,892
1,500?

420
00:32:25,942 --> 00:32:28,412
All right, I'll give you 1,800.

421
00:32:28,462 --> 00:32:31,772
I know the current market value. 18 it is.

422
00:32:31,822 --> 00:32:33,812
That's very gracious of you.

423
00:32:33,862 --> 00:32:38,012
Right, then. How about
say we look at this.

424
00:32:38,062 --> 00:32:40,612
This is a nice little bit
going on there, isn't it?

425
00:32:40,662 --> 00:32:43,772
Oh, but that was a gift
from Tsar Nicholas.

426
00:32:43,822 --> 00:32:46,732
I ain't asking you, though,
am I? I ain't asking you.

427
00:32:46,782 --> 00:32:50,292
All right. I come here to do business,

428
00:32:50,342 --> 00:32:53,372
offer my professional services.
If you keep interrupting me,

429
00:32:53,422 --> 00:32:55,652
I won't be able to focus and
do my job, you understand?

430
00:32:55,702 --> 00:32:58,812
Mr Romanov, let me remind
you, we were told to come here

431
00:32:58,862 --> 00:33:01,172
and choose what we like...

432
00:33:01,222 --> 00:33:02,892
and now we have chosen.

433
00:33:02,942 --> 00:33:05,892
Tsar Nicholas give you
that? I'll give you four.

434
00:33:05,942 --> 00:33:08,742
Five... with the royal provenance.

435
00:33:11,342 --> 00:33:12,412
Done.

436
00:33:12,462 --> 00:33:15,172
Right, Rumplestiltskin, let's go over here

437
00:33:15,222 --> 00:33:18,412
and have a look what's in these boxes.

438
00:33:18,462 --> 00:33:22,292
Two. That's much nicer. Ten.

439
00:33:22,342 --> 00:33:25,532
That there is definitely a five.

440
00:33:25,582 --> 00:33:26,772
Are you keeping score?

441
00:33:26,822 --> 00:33:29,292
- Yes, I am.
- Another five.

442
00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:32,212
- Seven. - Six. - Let's call it six, eh?

443
00:33:32,262 --> 00:33:34,972
- Beauty. Look at that.
- Beautiful, isn't it?

444
00:33:35,022 --> 00:33:38,572
- That is splendid. - Splendid,
yes. - Beautiful, is it not? - It is.

445
00:33:38,622 --> 00:33:42,052
- It's a work of art. You recognise
this work, do you? - Immediately.

446
00:33:42,102 --> 00:33:45,932
I'm guessing, right, that all the
bad ideas around here, they're you.

447
00:33:45,982 --> 00:33:49,012
They are you, aren't they? Hmm?

448
00:33:49,062 --> 00:33:50,252
What do you mean?

449
00:33:50,302 --> 00:33:54,652
Yeah. Tommy, see this, right?
It's got paste in it. That's paste.

450
00:33:54,702 --> 00:33:56,132
Let me tell you something, son.

451
00:33:56,182 --> 00:33:59,812
Somebody comes into my shop
with some paste like this,

452
00:33:59,862 --> 00:34:03,612
usually what I make them do, right,

453
00:34:03,662 --> 00:34:05,732
is fucking swallow it.

454
00:34:05,782 --> 00:34:08,382
Eh? What game are you playing?

455
00:34:12,982 --> 00:34:15,182
- Eh?
- Mr Solomons...

456
00:34:18,422 --> 00:34:22,172
- .. shall we, er... shall
we clean it up? - Be careful.

457
00:34:22,222 --> 00:34:23,542
Eh?

458
00:34:25,222 --> 00:34:26,852
Mm?

459
00:34:26,902 --> 00:34:29,612
Yeah. Yeah.

460
00:34:29,662 --> 00:34:31,662
Right, what we got?

461
00:34:32,742 --> 00:34:34,302
37,600.

462
00:34:37,182 --> 00:34:38,582
Well...

463
00:34:45,022 --> 00:34:47,162
Do you have any eggs?

464
00:34:47,862 --> 00:34:49,372
I am simply asking...

465
00:34:49,422 --> 00:34:51,772
Faberge is not part of the deal.

466
00:34:51,822 --> 00:34:53,892
We would not offer you Faberge eggs.

467
00:34:53,942 --> 00:34:56,572
Mr Romanov, my jeweller here,

468
00:34:56,622 --> 00:34:59,492
he advises me to insist...

469
00:34:59,542 --> 00:35:00,892
on Faberge.

470
00:35:00,942 --> 00:35:03,342
It's a deal-breaker, Tommy.

471
00:35:20,382 --> 00:35:21,662
Oh...

472
00:35:23,662 --> 00:35:26,212
I brought that from Crimea myself.

473
00:35:26,262 --> 00:35:27,932
Fucking hell.

474
00:35:32,382 --> 00:35:36,502
With the provenance of that being
laid by such a delicate beauty...

475
00:35:38,622 --> 00:35:42,542
.. that does indeed bring the
entire selection to £70,000.

476
00:35:54,302 --> 00:35:58,052
- Good man. - And now, Mr Shelby,
you will join your brothers and

477
00:35:58,102 --> 00:36:00,772
Mr Solomons will take his leave.

478
00:36:02,022 --> 00:36:04,662
I demand absolute honesty.

479
00:36:23,382 --> 00:36:26,252
- Oh, sorry. Can I...?
- I insist.

480
00:36:35,462 --> 00:36:36,802
There.

481
00:36:38,022 --> 00:36:40,742
A woman of style and substance.

482
00:36:46,702 --> 00:36:50,422
I'm a student of silence. Is
this good silence or bad silence?

483
00:36:51,462 --> 00:36:53,002
It's good.

484
00:36:56,222 --> 00:36:57,762
It's good.

485
00:37:03,622 --> 00:37:06,622
- It's very good.
- No. It's still wet.

486
00:37:09,982 --> 00:37:14,172
I know it isn't saying much in
the grand scheme of things but

487
00:37:14,222 --> 00:37:17,162
this is the best work I've ever done.

488
00:37:24,462 --> 00:37:26,402
I'll miss Sundays.

489
00:37:29,462 --> 00:37:31,862
There will be more Sundays.

490
00:38:02,702 --> 00:38:04,772
Sorry.

491
00:38:04,822 --> 00:38:07,692
Sorry, can you not do that, please?

492
00:38:08,142 --> 00:38:09,852
Can you just not do that, please?

493
00:38:09,902 --> 00:38:12,492
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Sorry.

494
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:16,702
- It's all right. - I'm sorry. - It's
all right. No, honestly, it's all right.

495
00:38:56,622 --> 00:38:57,962
Vodka!

496
00:38:59,302 --> 00:39:01,842
I sewed your buttons back on.

497
00:39:02,942 --> 00:39:05,882
I wanted to see if I did a good job.

498
00:39:07,982 --> 00:39:09,722
Yeah, you did.

499
00:39:10,622 --> 00:39:12,622
You did a good job.

500
00:39:14,942 --> 00:39:16,142
Sir?

501
00:39:17,302 --> 00:39:19,372
No.

502
00:39:19,422 --> 00:39:20,892
I didn't.

503
00:39:37,822 --> 00:39:40,762
My aunt only employs the best whores.

504
00:39:44,902 --> 00:39:46,812
How did you feel when I held him?

505
00:39:46,862 --> 00:39:48,732
You were jealous.

506
00:39:49,382 --> 00:39:51,052
You wanted to kill me.

507
00:39:51,102 --> 00:39:52,692
Or him.

508
00:39:52,742 --> 00:39:53,882
No?

509
00:39:58,302 --> 00:40:01,242
Why do you play games with people...

510
00:40:01,982 --> 00:40:04,852
.. when there is no benefit to you?

511
00:40:07,062 --> 00:40:09,802
In Russia, because we were bored.

512
00:40:10,502 --> 00:40:12,642
In England, because...

513
00:40:13,582 --> 00:40:16,122
.. we don't know how to stop.

514
00:40:16,542 --> 00:40:19,842
At least there are silly
games and orgasms.

515
00:40:24,302 --> 00:40:26,532
So let's fuck.

516
00:40:26,582 --> 00:40:27,892
Here?

517
00:40:27,942 --> 00:40:29,892
No.

518
00:40:29,942 --> 00:40:32,082
No, in a darker place.

519
00:41:55,542 --> 00:41:58,142
You still love her, don't you?

520
00:42:03,262 --> 00:42:04,612
You want her?

521
00:42:04,662 --> 00:42:07,012
Why would you fucking say that?

522
00:42:07,062 --> 00:42:08,412
Why would you fucking say it?

523
00:42:08,462 --> 00:42:11,252
- Just tell me. You love her.
- What are you fucking saying?

524
00:42:11,302 --> 00:42:13,702
You want her? You want her.

525
00:42:16,462 --> 00:42:19,062
Who the fuck are you? Eh?

526
00:42:21,702 --> 00:42:22,902
Hm?

527
00:42:27,502 --> 00:42:29,972
What are you fucking saying?

528
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:06,582
You want her...

529
00:43:08,262 --> 00:43:09,862
.. tonight?

530
00:43:13,622 --> 00:43:15,022
Watch...

531
00:43:24,502 --> 00:43:27,532
In the palace in Tbilisi,
there was a priest...

532
00:43:27,582 --> 00:43:30,252
and he would put his hands here.

533
00:43:32,342 --> 00:43:34,572
And with that strangulation
there was also ecstasy.

534
00:43:34,622 --> 00:43:37,722
It's called Khlysty, a Siberian prayer.

535
00:43:38,622 --> 00:43:40,932
You are almost hung over.

536
00:43:40,982 --> 00:43:44,772
You are almost dead, but in that moment...

537
00:43:49,182 --> 00:43:52,332
Women who had lost men
in the war would lay down

538
00:43:52,382 --> 00:43:54,492
and they would fuck...

539
00:43:54,542 --> 00:43:56,852
the ghost.

540
00:43:56,902 --> 00:43:59,212
You want her.

541
00:43:59,262 --> 00:44:01,572
You want her, don't you?

542
00:44:01,622 --> 00:44:03,292
You want her.

There.

552
00:45:20,622 --> 00:45:23,562
I opened up another treasury for you.

Yes.

I tell you what, I swear at one point...

576
00:47:52,302 --> 00:47:54,892
at one point I looked down,

577
00:47:54,942 --> 00:47:57,052
I got the top of her head,

578
00:47:57,102 --> 00:47:59,772
and I thought she was going to
pull me cock off in her hand

579
00:47:59,822 --> 00:48:01,932
and fucking throw it out of the window.

580

00:48:09,902 --> 00:48:12,102
We've had worse nights.

584
00:48:13,622 --> 00:48:15,132
You're quiet, Arthur, eh?

585
00:48:15,182 --> 00:48:16,412
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fuck off.

586
00:48:16,462 --> 00:48:17,892
How was your night, brother?

587
00:48:17,942 --> 00:48:20,492
- You got all your buttons back, eh?
- Yeah, all right. Fuck off.

588
00:48:20,542 --> 00:48:22,772
Yeah, what's God going to
say about it, Arthur, eh?

589
00:48:22,822 --> 00:48:24,962
Fuck off, both of ya.

590
00:48:27,942 --> 00:48:30,342
He tells Linda everything.

591
00:48:31,542 --> 00:48:32,852
Every single thing.

592
00:48:32,902 --> 00:48:35,302
Yeah, well, we'll see.

593
00:48:41,222 --> 00:48:44,262
We're going to miss you
when you're gone now, Arthur.

594
00:48:47,022 --> 00:48:49,422
Just drive the fucking car.

595
00:49:18,542 --> 00:49:22,652
Private Letso reporting
for duty, Sergeant Major.

596
00:49:22,702 --> 00:49:24,572
At ease, Private.

597
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:29,292
Good to see you.

598
00:49:32,702 --> 00:49:34,252
Seven left...

599
00:49:34,302 --> 00:49:36,092
out of 50.

600
00:49:36,142 --> 00:49:38,172
Should I get them tea?

601
00:49:38,222 --> 00:49:39,572
Get 'em beer, Curly.

602
00:49:39,622 --> 00:49:42,252
They used to run on it
like cars on petrol.

603
00:49:42,302 --> 00:49:44,052
Give them the Black Country stuff.

604
00:49:44,102 --> 00:49:46,892
It's in a barrel with the tack.

605
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,212
They're going to fucking clean me out.

606
00:49:49,262 --> 00:49:52,652
Whatever they take, they'll
put back. They're good men.

607
00:49:52,702 --> 00:49:54,572
John, Arthur.

608
00:49:54,622 --> 00:49:56,892
You remember these boys?

609
00:49:57,942 --> 00:50:02,132
Well, if it ain't the Tipton
fucking Clay-Kickers, eh?

610
00:50:02,182 --> 00:50:04,982
- Clay-Kickers.
- Come here, you.

611
00:50:11,302 --> 00:50:15,052
This is William Letso, from the
South African Native Labour Corps.

612
00:50:15,102 --> 00:50:18,652
Sent to Flanders from the
Bloemfontein diamond mines.

613
00:50:18,702 --> 00:50:21,372
The best tunneller I ever met.

614
00:50:21,422 --> 00:50:23,692
So there's three cellars
underneath the house.

615
00:50:23,742 --> 00:50:25,812
Wine, kitchen, septic.

616
00:50:25,862 --> 00:50:28,932
There's a tunnel here that
runs from the house underneath

617
00:50:28,982 --> 00:50:31,252
the river to an underground strong room.

618
00:50:31,302 --> 00:50:33,972
Now this used to be the Palace treasury.

619
00:50:34,022 --> 00:50:37,532
The tunnel runs directly west and
it's separated from the house

620
00:50:37,582 --> 00:50:39,132
by three iron doors

621
00:50:39,182 --> 00:50:41,132
with locks we can't open.

622
00:50:41,182 --> 00:50:45,662
We need our tunnel to run from here
and hit the strong room direct.

623
00:51:26,302 --> 00:51:28,902
Primrose Hill, 23. Ada Thorne.

624
00:51:31,102 --> 00:51:32,732
Ada?

625
00:51:32,782 --> 00:51:34,982
Is Michael still there?

626
00:51:38,222 --> 00:51:41,012
Right, would you tell him
that I've taken the car?

627
00:51:41,062 --> 00:51:43,532
He can take the train.

628
00:51:43,582 --> 00:51:47,582
Try and find out why he's
been so bloody sour lately.

629
00:53:27,982 --> 00:53:31,492
Shouldn't go looking through
other people's private things.

630
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:33,212
He's my son.

631
00:53:34,582 --> 00:53:37,252
The bullet was mine. I never
got a chance to fire it.

632
00:53:37,302 --> 00:53:40,892
And the gypsy rules say
it must be passed on.

633
00:53:40,942 --> 00:53:42,732
It's not about rules, Pol.

634
00:53:42,782 --> 00:53:44,982
It's about he asked me.

635
00:53:46,262 --> 00:53:47,972
It's about he told me

636
00:53:48,022 --> 00:53:50,222
why he wanted to do it.

637
00:53:50,502 --> 00:53:52,652
Now, if I tell you,

638
00:53:52,702 --> 00:53:55,372
I can't take the knowledge back.

639
00:53:57,102 --> 00:53:59,242
Better off without it.

640
00:54:03,222 --> 00:54:05,132
So this is when he was with the parish.

641
00:54:05,182 --> 00:54:07,582
Better off without it, Pol.

642
00:54:18,702 --> 00:54:21,612
This is when he was with the Fathers...

643
00:54:21,662 --> 00:54:25,562
This is when he was in the
care of the Holy Fathers.

644
00:54:26,102 --> 00:54:28,972
Michael wants it so you don't know.

645
00:54:38,622 --> 00:54:41,932
- That priest...
- That priest...

646
00:54:41,982 --> 00:54:43,652
who was there...

647
00:54:43,702 --> 00:54:45,972
when he was taken in...

648
00:54:46,022 --> 00:54:48,492
and who is still walking
the fucking earth.

649
00:54:48,542 --> 00:54:49,812
Fuck.

650
00:54:58,732 --> 00:54:59,732
Fuck.

651
00:54:59,782 --> 00:55:01,252
He asked me, Pol...

652
00:55:01,302 --> 00:55:03,102
and I said yes.

653
00:55:07,862 --> 00:55:09,732
And I said,

654
00:55:09,782 --> 00:55:13,502
"You put a bullet in
that fucker's brains...

655
00:55:15,862 --> 00:55:18,802
".. by order of the Peaky Blinders."

656
00:55:30,262 --> 00:55:31,502
No.

657
00:55:33,582 --> 00:55:35,182
Not my son.

658
00:55:38,302 --> 00:55:40,412
He'll still be as dead if Arthur does it.

659
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:43,462
And part of him will always stay dead.

660
00:55:46,302 --> 00:55:47,492
I swear to God...

661
00:55:47,542 --> 00:55:48,932
In whose house it took place.

662
00:55:48,982 --> 00:55:51,722

663
00:55:52,582 --> 00:55:56,942
