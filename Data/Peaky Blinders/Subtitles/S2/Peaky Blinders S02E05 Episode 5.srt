1
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,799
You understand I'm the commanding
officer on this operation.

2
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,040
You're here purely as an observer.

3
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:06,040
Just do your duty.

4
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,320
Dear Lord,

5
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:14,200
for what we're about to receive
may the Lord make us truly grateful.

6
00:02:14,201 --> 00:02:22,202
Amen.

7
00:02:26,122 --> 00:02:29,921
Passover started off
way out there in the Far East,

8
00:02:29,922 --> 00:02:33,641
out in the sand, out in the desert,
where me forefathers come from.

9
00:02:33,642 --> 00:02:36,282
You know, the Jews, the brews,
whatever you want to call them.

10
00:02:37,322 --> 00:02:39,122
It started out
as a little speck on the horizon.

11
00:02:39,123 --> 00:02:40,202
Arthur, this ain't right.

12
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:43,162
Billy, don't worry, mate, you know
what I mean? If you want, you can leave.

13
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,642
If you need to go
to the little boys' room, you can leave.

14
00:02:45,643 --> 00:02:46,842
We going to open 'em in a minute.

15
00:02:46,843 --> 00:02:49,002
He's all right, he's all right,
Billy boy.

16
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:50,282
- Do you want to leave?
- No, you're all right.

17
00:02:50,283 --> 00:02:52,483
- You want to stay?
- I'll stay.

18
00:02:52,604 --> 00:02:54,362
You stay there, then, treacle.

19
00:02:54,363 --> 00:02:58,242
Okay, so the pharaoh.
Have you heard of him?

20
00:02:58,243 --> 00:03:02,163
He kept my people,
the Jewish people, in slavery,

21
00:03:02,164 --> 00:03:04,683
for thousands and thousands of years.

22
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:06,403
Persecuted race.

23
00:03:06,404 --> 00:03:09,564
He did, he persecuted my race.

24
00:03:09,565 --> 00:03:11,884
The killing of the innocent, right?

25
00:03:11,885 --> 00:03:15,124
Seder, this feast,
that what we is having here.

26
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:20,324
Seder is basically the day what
when the Jewish angels decided,

27
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:23,484
you know, that the evil
fucking Egyptians

28
00:03:23,485 --> 00:03:25,365
had pushed their fucking luck!

29
00:03:25,366 --> 00:03:26,604
Right.

30
00:03:26,605 --> 00:03:30,165
It is part of our tradition
to do with Seder, right,

31
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:35,325
that in order to make it good
with God to kill a king,

32
00:03:36,606 --> 00:03:40,405
we have to carry out the Korban Pesach.

33
00:03:40,406 --> 00:03:42,206
- Right.
- That,

34
00:03:42,207 --> 00:03:46,726
is the ritual sacrifice
of the Passover goat.

35
00:03:51,286 --> 00:03:55,167
- It's a goat.
- Yeah, and we're gonna sacrifice it.

36
00:03:55,887 --> 00:04:01,406
Tonight. That's part of the reason
why we have to shut the doors as well.

37
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:05,327
But this year we thought
we'd give the fucking goat a name.

38
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:08,447
- You've named it?
- We fucking did, yeah.

39
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:12,767
- They named the fucking goat.
- The evil fucking Egyptian pharaoh,

40
00:04:12,768 --> 00:04:14,367
- the fucking enemy.
- That's right.

41
00:04:14,368 --> 00:04:16,287
- You know what we called it?
- What did ya call him?

42
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:17,727
Tommy Shelby.

43
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,449
Stay where you are!

44
00:04:41,409 --> 00:04:42,769
You're all fired.

45
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:45,130
Fuck you.

46
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:48,730
That's right, let's take a load off.

47
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,249
So...

48
00:04:52,131 --> 00:04:54,489
And the evil Egyptian scum...

49
00:04:55,531 --> 00:04:57,730
was finally cleansed,

50
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:01,130
with the blood
of the Passover goat, mate.

51
00:05:08,532 --> 00:05:10,490
That's from Sabini.

52
00:05:11,491 --> 00:05:13,731
And tell your gypsy king...

53
00:05:14,851 --> 00:05:18,731
whoever comes
down south, shall return north

54
00:05:18,892 --> 00:05:22,652
in many fucking pieces.

55
00:05:36,173 --> 00:05:39,652
This fucking animal. He come in here,
right, with a fucking gun and razor

56
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:41,653
and he shot him in the face!

57
00:05:41,654 --> 00:05:43,892
And my lads, they restrained him.

58
00:05:43,893 --> 00:05:46,253
Look at him. He's dead. Is he dead?

59
00:05:46,414 --> 00:05:48,172
He's fucking dead!

60
00:05:48,173 --> 00:05:50,293
He wants arresting or something, right?

61
00:05:50,294 --> 00:05:52,293
Surely.

62
00:05:58,455 --> 00:06:02,854
Michael! You can't take him away again,
you can't take my son away!

63
00:06:02,855 --> 00:06:06,374
You come back here! No! No!

64
00:06:09,255 --> 00:06:12,575
Don't you fucking touch him!
Get off him!

65
00:06:12,616 --> 00:06:14,694
Don't say anything!
Tommy will get you out!

66
00:06:14,695 --> 00:06:15,775
Fuck!

67
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:18,255
I'll be all right...

68
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:27,495
You should know, that as of this night,
Tommy Shelby is finished.

69
00:06:41,377 --> 00:06:44,776
Mick? This is Thomas Shelby,
he's come to check up on his filly.

70
00:06:46,577 --> 00:06:48,257
Yes, I've heard about you.

71
00:06:49,578 --> 00:06:51,618
Mick is
the best horseman in England.

72
00:06:53,578 --> 00:06:55,977
He likes to waste money, I know that.

73
00:06:55,978 --> 00:06:57,697
According to the reports
I've been given,

74
00:06:57,698 --> 00:07:00,177
you're spending two pound a month
on worming powder.

75
00:07:00,178 --> 00:07:01,858
What? You want a horse with worms?

76
00:07:01,859 --> 00:07:04,137
Horses get worms from the water trough.

77
00:07:04,338 --> 00:07:06,538
Put goldfish in them,
they eat the worm eggs.

78
00:07:06,539 --> 00:07:08,017
Goldfish?

79
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:11,538
- It'll be a gypsy thing, is it?
- No.

80
00:07:11,739 --> 00:07:13,418
It's an accounting thing.

81
00:07:13,939 --> 00:07:17,338
- Goldfish cost a penny each.
- Or you can win them at the fair.

82
00:07:20,939 --> 00:07:24,498
If you want, I'll dispense
with the vet altogether. Excuse me.

83
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:30,379
Did you ever consider
a career in diplomacy?

84
00:07:34,861 --> 00:07:36,419
Hello, hello.

85
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,899
How are you?

86
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,380
Goldfish, seriously?

87
00:07:39,421 --> 00:07:40,939
Yup.

88
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:43,180
You people have a lot to learn.

89
00:08:00,862 --> 00:08:04,741
They asked me if I wanted a fire
in the guest bedroom.

90
00:08:06,742 --> 00:08:08,342
I said no.

91
00:08:10,502 --> 00:08:12,062
Just one fire tonight.

92
00:08:13,582 --> 00:08:15,422
Bold and fearless?

93
00:08:15,663 --> 00:08:17,142
Yes.

94
00:08:18,423 --> 00:08:20,342
Though I'm not really fearless.

95
00:08:29,544 --> 00:08:32,263
- Drink?
- Why not?

96
00:08:45,545 --> 00:08:49,184
- Madam, there is a telephone call.
- I'll take it in the drawing room.

97
00:08:49,185 --> 00:08:50,984
It's for Mr Shelby.

98
00:08:54,585 --> 00:08:56,224
We had a deal.

99
00:08:57,065 --> 00:08:58,665
Hey!

100
00:08:59,066 --> 00:09:01,144
We had a fucking deal.

101
00:09:01,466 --> 00:09:05,345
I would thank you to moderate
your language in a place of worship.

102
00:09:06,626 --> 00:09:09,145
We had a fucking deal.

103
00:09:12,066 --> 00:09:13,585
Mr Shelby.

104
00:09:15,587 --> 00:09:17,745
If you read the papers,

105
00:09:18,347 --> 00:09:21,586
you might have seen that
the Home Secretary has got himself

106
00:09:21,587 --> 00:09:25,986
into a bit of a fizz
about certain moral issues.

107
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:27,666
Prostitution.

108
00:09:27,747 --> 00:09:32,027
Protection, racketeering, drinking,
cocaine and, of course,

109
00:09:32,628 --> 00:09:34,426
gambling.

110
00:09:34,828 --> 00:09:36,747
And he's demanded results.

111
00:09:36,748 --> 00:09:39,347
You offered me protection.

112
00:09:39,348 --> 00:09:41,627
You promised me protection.

113
00:09:41,628 --> 00:09:46,547
Well, no, you see, it was Mr Churchill
that made you that promise.

114
00:09:47,428 --> 00:09:51,307
And the Home Secretary
outranks him, so...

115
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:55,668
And I can hardly be blamed
if your demented brother

116
00:09:55,669 --> 00:09:58,988
decides to go on some sort
of blood orgy during dinner.

117
00:09:58,989 --> 00:10:00,188
Do not fucking lie to me.

118
00:10:00,189 --> 00:10:04,068
Do not sit here
in your fucking church and lie to me!

119
00:10:05,870 --> 00:10:10,548
You will need to contain your emotions
or this meeting is at an end.

120
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,909
Good.

121
00:10:22,111 --> 00:10:24,029
That's better.

122
00:10:26,151 --> 00:10:27,550
So...

123
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:32,430
Let us review the new situation.

124
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,590
I have your brother in a prison cell,

125
00:10:34,591 --> 00:10:37,310
charged with the murder
of Billy Kitchen.

126
00:10:38,072 --> 00:10:40,430
The case against him is strong.

127
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:44,670
And I have no doubt
that his destiny is to hang.

128
00:10:45,072 --> 00:10:47,670
And then there is Polly's son Michael.

129
00:10:47,671 --> 00:10:52,791
He has already admitted to helping
Arthur burn down the Marquis Pub.

130
00:10:53,792 --> 00:10:57,031
He was
a tough nut to crack, that boy.

131
00:10:57,032 --> 00:10:58,552
But crack he did.

132
00:10:58,953 --> 00:11:01,151
So I have your brother facing the noose.

133
00:11:01,152 --> 00:11:04,032
I have your cousin facing
five years for arson.

134
00:11:04,033 --> 00:11:08,712
And I have
your entire organisation in disarray

135
00:11:08,713 --> 00:11:10,472
in Birmingham and in London.

136
00:11:10,473 --> 00:11:12,033
What do you want?

137
00:11:13,033 --> 00:11:14,713
What do I want?

138
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:17,312
I don't understand.

139
00:11:18,674 --> 00:11:20,113
I've already agreed

140
00:11:20,114 --> 00:11:22,673
to do your fucking killing for you.

141
00:11:23,594 --> 00:11:27,273
Now what is it you want from me?

142
00:11:27,314 --> 00:11:30,873
There you go, you see...

143
00:11:32,755 --> 00:11:37,514
An agreement is not the same thing
as an assurance, now, is it?

144
00:11:38,595 --> 00:11:41,315
See, I found that

145
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,114
I wasn't sleeping so well.

146
00:11:45,636 --> 00:11:47,154
And it wasn't just that...

147
00:11:47,155 --> 00:11:50,194
the smell and the noise
in that room, no.

148
00:11:50,795 --> 00:11:54,474
It was the nagging doubt.
The knowledge.

149
00:11:54,876 --> 00:11:56,795
The knowledge that...

150
00:11:58,277 --> 00:12:01,356
Tommy Shelby is not afraid to die.

151
00:12:03,116 --> 00:12:05,196
And therefore,

152
00:12:05,637 --> 00:12:08,876
the threat to your own life
might not be enough

153
00:12:09,077 --> 00:12:14,116
to make it certain that
you will obey me on the given day.

154
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:20,636
I needed also the power
of life and death over your family

155
00:12:20,637 --> 00:12:23,476
and that I now have.

156
00:12:23,637 --> 00:12:27,796
Your brother, your cousin
and your sister.

157
00:12:29,318 --> 00:12:34,117
I've known her address in Primrose Hill
since the day she moved in.

158
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:38,638
Now she is safe only as long
as I want her to be.

159
00:12:39,439 --> 00:12:44,118
I've been ahead of you,
every step of the way.

160
00:12:45,239 --> 00:12:48,638
And, as my father used to say,

161
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:53,598
to make sure your dog obeys you,
you have to show it the stick

162
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:55,839
once in a while.

163
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,199
Tommy, Arthur's in solitary confinement.
Michael's in remand wing...

164
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,199
Yeah, I already know.
Get out, shut the doors.

165
00:13:23,801 --> 00:13:25,281
Tommy?

166
00:13:26,641 --> 00:13:28,201
It's me.

167
00:13:31,362 --> 00:13:32,841
Tommy, can you hear me?

168
00:13:33,802 --> 00:13:35,361
Yes, Grace.

169
00:13:36,042 --> 00:13:37,922
I think you called.

170
00:13:38,203 --> 00:13:39,881
I haven't slept.

171
00:13:42,283 --> 00:13:44,521
Grace, this is not a good time.

172
00:13:44,843 --> 00:13:46,162
I can call you back.

173
00:13:46,163 --> 00:13:48,642
- No, no, it's fine. It's all right.
- Can we meet?

174
00:13:50,283 --> 00:13:52,682
Yes, we'll meet.

175
00:13:53,163 --> 00:13:54,683
When?

176
00:13:58,044 --> 00:14:00,642
Grace, there are some things
I have to do first.

177
00:14:09,844 --> 00:14:11,484
John?

178
00:14:12,204 --> 00:14:15,004
Coppers have lifted
10 of our men in Camden town,

179
00:14:15,485 --> 00:14:17,003
the rest of them on the run.

180
00:14:17,004 --> 00:14:19,004
- Tom, they've taken Michael.
- Business first.

181
00:14:19,005 --> 00:14:22,364
- They took Michael last night.
- Polly, business first!

182
00:14:23,325 --> 00:14:24,725
John?

183
00:14:25,085 --> 00:14:26,724
They took all our whisky.

184
00:14:27,245 --> 00:14:29,605
So no doubt
they'll be supping that for Christmas.

185
00:14:30,205 --> 00:14:32,205
They've impounded all our vans,

186
00:14:32,206 --> 00:14:34,364
put their own locks on the warehouse.

187
00:14:35,766 --> 00:14:39,725
The Eden Club and all our pubs
have been raided by the coppers

188
00:14:39,886 --> 00:14:42,685
and handed back to Sabini and Solomons.

189
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:46,965
The Black Country boys think
it was Arthur who killed Billy

190
00:14:46,966 --> 00:14:49,205
because that's what
the coppers told them.

191
00:14:49,606 --> 00:14:52,126
So there'll be no more free passes
for our whisky boats.

192
00:14:52,127 --> 00:14:53,805
I don't give a fuck about whisky.

193
00:14:53,806 --> 00:14:55,966
I don't give a fuck about Billy Kitchen.

194
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:59,086
I want my son out of prison now.

195
00:14:59,087 --> 00:15:00,526
Thomas, I spoke to Johnny Dogs.

196
00:15:00,527 --> 00:15:02,366
This meeting should just be family.

197
00:15:02,367 --> 00:15:04,366
- I can help.
- It's family only, she's not blood.

198
00:15:04,367 --> 00:15:06,446
- Let her speak.
- Tommy! Or is this a business...

199
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,887
Enough!

200
00:15:09,768 --> 00:15:11,767
Enough, Polly.

201
00:15:12,008 --> 00:15:13,647
Esme.

202
00:15:13,648 --> 00:15:15,847
I spoke to Johnny Dogs.
The Lees are kin.

203
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,088
- The bloody Lees!
- They can give us men.

204
00:15:18,089 --> 00:15:20,287
We don't need more fucking men.

205
00:15:20,368 --> 00:15:23,807
It's men that have done
the damage. It's...

206
00:15:24,368 --> 00:15:28,448
It is men fighting like cockerels that
have put us here in the first place.

207
00:15:29,289 --> 00:15:32,168
Esme, I'll take up their offer.
We need men.

208
00:15:39,609 --> 00:15:43,728
If Michael ever gets out of prison,

209
00:15:44,009 --> 00:15:48,049
I am taking him away
from this family, for good.

210
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:53,049
This life is bad.

211
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,010
This life is all bad.

212
00:15:59,011 --> 00:16:01,730
- Aunt Pol, what are you doing?
- Shut up and walk.

213
00:16:10,371 --> 00:16:12,131
Thomas.

214
00:16:13,531 --> 00:16:16,252
Should I go and speak
to Queen Mary Lee at the Black Patch?

215
00:16:21,011 --> 00:16:22,691
Yes.

216
00:16:22,972 --> 00:16:25,011
She can give us soldiers
for a few nights.

217
00:16:25,012 --> 00:16:26,611
Good.

218
00:16:30,012 --> 00:16:33,132
John, go bring up the car.

219
00:16:53,414 --> 00:16:55,533
Imagine riding away, Thomas.

220
00:16:56,654 --> 00:16:58,973
Living the real life, you know?

221
00:16:59,934 --> 00:17:02,134
Your gypsy half is the stronger.

222
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:05,814
You just want to ride away.

223
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,933
France is the new place
for us, they say.

224
00:17:12,095 --> 00:17:14,455
Lot of metal lying around still.

225
00:17:14,776 --> 00:17:17,534
Guns and trucks
and spent shells and things.

226
00:17:18,856 --> 00:17:20,454
Then you go south.

227
00:17:21,536 --> 00:17:23,055
Saintes Maries.

228
00:17:23,815 --> 00:17:25,655
Where the Black Madonna is.

229
00:17:26,856 --> 00:17:29,135
My brothers go sometimes for the fair.

230
00:17:31,097 --> 00:17:32,895
It's like a home for us.

231
00:17:36,736 --> 00:17:39,256
They still let you get lost there.

232
00:17:50,737 --> 00:17:53,056
I've been to France, Esme.

233
00:17:54,618 --> 00:17:56,417
So has John.

234
00:17:57,858 --> 00:18:01,857
Now get your coat
and go with your husband.

235
00:18:11,659 --> 00:18:15,178
If you ever talk about getting
lost again, I'll cut you

236
00:18:16,379 --> 00:18:18,338
from this family.

237
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,619
What family?

238
00:18:48,221 --> 00:18:50,260
Come in.

239
00:18:55,101 --> 00:18:57,901
Polly.

240
00:18:59,661 --> 00:19:01,701
I've come to see my son.

241
00:19:02,782 --> 00:19:04,581
Close the door.

242
00:19:08,222 --> 00:19:11,981
I've just been conducting
an interrogation.

243
00:19:13,022 --> 00:19:15,262
It can be awfully hard on the hands.

244
00:19:15,742 --> 00:19:18,302
My son. Michael. Where is he?

245
00:19:18,623 --> 00:19:20,661
Do you think I need a shave?

246
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:24,542
It's been a long day.

247
00:19:24,903 --> 00:19:26,862
I need a shave, don't you think?

248
00:19:28,863 --> 00:19:32,662
Well, maybe it can wait till later.

249
00:19:34,864 --> 00:19:39,103
Your son has been having
a hard time of it I'm told.

250
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:41,983
And that is why I thought
that you and I together,

251
00:19:41,984 --> 00:19:45,543
we should do whatever we can
to get him freed.

252
00:19:46,424 --> 00:19:49,823
Now, I have a form here, a release form.

253
00:19:50,464 --> 00:19:52,384
With my signature,

254
00:19:52,705 --> 00:19:56,824
he can be freed
by tomorrow morning at dawn.

255
00:20:12,786 --> 00:20:14,385
So sign it.

256
00:20:17,226 --> 00:20:19,505
- He didn't do anything.
- "Sign it,

257
00:20:19,506 --> 00:20:22,785
"Mr Campbell. Please, sir."

258
00:20:23,786 --> 00:20:26,786
Something like that. That would be
a way to say that, wouldn't it?

259
00:20:28,587 --> 00:20:30,146
Now,

260
00:20:31,107 --> 00:20:35,266
what would prompt me
to do you such a favour?

261
00:20:37,547 --> 00:20:39,346
What do you want?

262
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,106
Information?

263
00:20:43,107 --> 00:20:48,307
You mean inside information about
Tommy Shelby's criminal empire?

264
00:20:49,788 --> 00:20:51,587
With respect,

265
00:20:51,988 --> 00:20:55,268
I would say I know more
about Tommy's dealings than you do.

266
00:20:55,309 --> 00:20:59,028
He doesn't trouble the family with
Irish business for instance, does he?

267
00:20:59,029 --> 00:21:00,467
No.

268
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:02,748
So, no.

269
00:21:03,789 --> 00:21:06,548
It's not information I need.

270
00:21:13,109 --> 00:21:15,549
What else could you give me

271
00:21:16,909 --> 00:21:19,229
in return for my signature?

272
00:21:20,709 --> 00:21:23,589
I'm talking about
a simple transaction here.

273
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,830
I have a great curiosity.

274
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:32,550
Like a magpie sees something,

275
00:21:34,511 --> 00:21:36,830
something shining in the mud.

276
00:21:38,431 --> 00:21:41,191
He has no need for the silver,

277
00:21:42,751 --> 00:21:44,711
but he takes it anyway.

278
00:22:11,113 --> 00:22:12,872
Sign the form.

279
00:22:13,193 --> 00:22:16,432
- "Please, sir."
- Please, sir.

280
00:22:19,593 --> 00:22:23,032
I will sign that form with this hand

281
00:22:24,314 --> 00:22:26,513
when I am finished.

282
00:22:26,554 --> 00:22:29,873
- It's a deal?
- It's a deal.

283
00:22:33,514 --> 00:22:36,713
- Don't cry.
- I can cry.

284
00:22:37,154 --> 00:22:38,834
So...

285
00:22:39,794 --> 00:22:41,994
That is what I want.

286
00:22:42,035 --> 00:22:44,394
I need you to cry.

287
00:22:45,875 --> 00:22:47,635
I will try.

288
00:22:50,315 --> 00:22:53,554
"I need a favour, Mr Campbell, sir."

289
00:22:53,555 --> 00:22:57,755
"And I will do anything,
anything in return."

290
00:22:57,756 --> 00:23:00,355
That's what you might have said.

291
00:23:03,076 --> 00:23:05,235
I felt something

292
00:23:06,636 --> 00:23:08,875
when I had you up against that car.

293
00:23:08,876 --> 00:23:11,036
And you felt it too.

294
00:23:11,117 --> 00:23:15,396
Don't tell me you didn't,
Polly, because...

295
00:23:15,677 --> 00:23:18,756
And now you think you're...

296
00:23:19,637 --> 00:23:21,876
You're so respectable,

297
00:23:21,917 --> 00:23:24,877
with your son and your house

298
00:23:24,878 --> 00:23:30,236
and your maid, but I know
what you are, gypsy Fenian slut.

299
00:23:31,638 --> 00:23:34,757
Do you want to do it on the floor
or on the desk, Mr Campbell?

300
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:46,797
Now you cry.

301
00:23:47,759 --> 00:23:49,718
You cry!

302
00:23:57,079 --> 00:23:59,838
Get out.
Get out.

303
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,158
Get out!

304
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:06,639
No. No! I want him free.

305
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,479
I'll get him free.

306
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,080
You don't need to shave.

307
00:24:16,920 --> 00:24:18,920
You don't need to do anything.

308
00:24:21,641 --> 00:24:24,360
A victory is just doing nothing as well.

309
00:24:25,441 --> 00:24:27,440
Doing it soft and gentle.

310
00:24:36,082 --> 00:24:38,561
Should I talk or not talk?

311
00:24:41,242 --> 00:24:44,521
Should it be like
I'm weak and small, yes?

312
00:24:47,603 --> 00:24:49,921
Do you want me to talk or not to talk?

313
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:53,801
Talk.

314
00:24:53,962 --> 00:24:55,842
You're small and weak.

315
00:24:57,523 --> 00:24:59,042
That's what I am...

316
00:25:00,043 --> 00:25:02,122
Small and weak.

317
00:25:03,083 --> 00:25:04,883
Look.

318
00:25:10,443 --> 00:25:12,683
You made me cry.

319
00:25:16,884 --> 00:25:18,323
No!

320
00:25:19,644 --> 00:25:21,844
We had an agreement, right?

321
00:25:21,845 --> 00:25:24,003
Yes. Yes!

322
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:34,085
Where have you been?

323
00:25:35,805 --> 00:25:38,285
Went to the Spotted Dog in Digbeth.

324
00:25:38,885 --> 00:25:40,524
A glass or two of rum.

325
00:25:42,366 --> 00:25:44,285
Was it one glass or two?

326
00:25:44,486 --> 00:25:46,125
It was three.

327
00:25:47,406 --> 00:25:48,925
Where's the baby?

328
00:25:49,966 --> 00:25:51,645
Sleeping.

329
00:25:52,806 --> 00:25:54,606
More like five.

330
00:25:59,407 --> 00:26:01,606
It was more like six.

331
00:26:03,527 --> 00:26:05,446
Did you meet the maid?

332
00:26:05,887 --> 00:26:08,966
Talked politics with her and
she got bored and went to bed.

333
00:26:13,247 --> 00:26:15,047
I phoned James.

334
00:26:15,248 --> 00:26:17,326
He talked to the lawyer anyway.

335
00:26:17,488 --> 00:26:19,687
Said he'd take Arthur's case for free,

336
00:26:19,688 --> 00:26:21,647
so we don't need Tommy.

337
00:26:25,248 --> 00:26:26,648
Pol?

338
00:26:27,489 --> 00:26:30,087
We'll get Michael free
as well, I promise.

339
00:26:30,288 --> 00:26:32,807
There's no need,
they'll let him out in the morning.

340
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:40,208
If the baby wants anything at night,
ring the bell by the bed.

341
00:26:42,209 --> 00:26:45,528
She gets paid to work 24 hours,
that girl. She's getting lazy.

342
00:26:47,129 --> 00:26:48,889
Well...

343
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,889
Take advantage if you're nice.

344
00:28:32,296 --> 00:28:34,815
You need cream on them cuts
or they'll go bad.

345
00:28:42,376 --> 00:28:44,416
The screws told me why I've been freed.

346
00:28:49,417 --> 00:28:51,216
They told me what you did.

347
00:28:57,938 --> 00:28:59,736
They thought it was funny.

348
00:29:07,057 --> 00:29:08,458
Maybe it is.

349
00:29:33,819 --> 00:29:35,939
What are you doing, Tommy?

350
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:38,979
Shovelling shit, Curly.

351
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,819
Just like you.

352
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,340
Why're you doing that, Tommy?

353
00:29:48,341 --> 00:29:51,460
To remind meself what I'd be

354
00:29:51,461 --> 00:29:53,619
if I wasn't who I am.

355
00:30:24,463 --> 00:30:26,901
Tommy. What's going on?

356
00:30:26,902 --> 00:30:29,942
I think Tommy's lost his mind, Charlie.

357
00:30:31,623 --> 00:30:35,182
Well, it's honest work, Curly.

358
00:30:36,103 --> 00:30:38,542
But I don't want to get used to it.

359
00:30:39,223 --> 00:30:42,103
So I'll need six cans of petrol.

360
00:30:42,464 --> 00:30:44,783
Bring them to the garage.

361
00:30:45,064 --> 00:30:47,543
Put them in the back of the car.

362
00:30:47,584 --> 00:30:49,463
Six cans?

363
00:30:50,224 --> 00:30:51,783
Tommy.

364
00:30:51,824 --> 00:30:54,824
If you ever want a job,
I'll get you your own shovel.

365
00:30:56,184 --> 00:30:59,343
Petrol. Yes. Yeah.

366
00:31:49,947 --> 00:31:52,787
You're far too gorgeous
for some half-blind auntie.

367
00:31:53,587 --> 00:31:55,627
She's my harshest critic.

368
00:31:55,628 --> 00:31:57,508
I have to be perfect.

369
00:31:58,548 --> 00:32:01,028
She's not half-blind,
she's half-deaf.

370
00:32:01,868 --> 00:32:04,108
So what time will you be back?

371
00:32:04,109 --> 00:32:05,628
Before midnight.

372
00:32:06,948 --> 00:32:08,788
I'll be awake.

373
00:33:04,632 --> 00:33:06,031
Is this your house?

374
00:33:06,032 --> 00:33:07,592
Yes.

375
00:33:07,753 --> 00:33:09,591
Have a seat.

376
00:33:20,233 --> 00:33:22,232
Do I not get a drink?

377
00:33:22,553 --> 00:33:24,153
Please.

378
00:33:27,754 --> 00:33:30,152
- You want one?
- Yes.

379
00:33:30,153 --> 00:33:31,633
Still whisky?

380
00:33:32,714 --> 00:33:34,233
Yes.

381
00:33:34,794 --> 00:33:36,593
But other things have changed.

382
00:33:36,594 --> 00:33:38,393
I saw vans with your name on
at the docks.

383
00:33:38,394 --> 00:33:40,313
Yes, some things have changed.

384
00:33:58,156 --> 00:33:59,914
Tommy, I really wasn't sure
about coming tonight.

385
00:33:59,915 --> 00:34:02,355
I lit a fire in the bedroom upstairs.

386
00:34:03,515 --> 00:34:05,115
My plan was

387
00:34:05,116 --> 00:34:07,235
that we'd sit here for a while,

388
00:34:08,516 --> 00:34:10,275
talk about old times,

389
00:34:10,276 --> 00:34:12,035
drink some whisky.

390
00:34:14,797 --> 00:34:17,076
And I was gonna tell you

391
00:34:17,197 --> 00:34:18,396
I hadn't spent a day

392
00:34:18,397 --> 00:34:20,075
without thinking about you.

393
00:34:20,677 --> 00:34:22,316
And then we were gonna go upstairs

394
00:34:22,317 --> 00:34:24,156
and sleep together.

395
00:34:25,557 --> 00:34:28,796
But just now on the way
to opening the door,

396
00:34:28,917 --> 00:34:30,637
I changed me mind.

397
00:34:33,637 --> 00:34:35,357
So just have one drink

398
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:36,916
tell me how happy you are in New York

399
00:34:36,917 --> 00:34:38,397
and then you can go.

400
00:34:38,398 --> 00:34:40,637
You changed your mind?

401
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:42,837
So you can go.

402
00:34:43,518 --> 00:34:45,237
Well...

403
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,198
As a matter of fact,

404
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,957
I am happy in New York.

405
00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:51,598
And I am married.

406
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,397
Yeah, he's... He's rich. I know.

407
00:34:53,398 --> 00:34:55,078
And he's sweet.

408
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,198
And he's kind to me.

409
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:59,478
So what makes you think that
I would have gone to bed with you

410
00:34:59,479 --> 00:35:02,158
after one whisky and some conversation?

411
00:35:02,159 --> 00:35:03,919
I was accounting for three whiskys.

412
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,678
How dare you?

413
00:35:05,799 --> 00:35:07,679
It doesn't matter now,
'cause I've changed me mind.

414
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:10,318
I came here because you asked me.

415
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,239
Even though he's sweet
and he's kind to you?

416
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,759
And now I feel like an idiot.

417
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,159
Well, then, go.

418
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:16,759
Jesus.

419
00:35:27,961 --> 00:35:30,039
Well, you're still here.

420
00:35:33,962 --> 00:35:35,361
Are you so certain?

421
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:37,801
That you're still in love with me?

422
00:35:39,121 --> 00:35:40,801
I was.

423
00:35:41,602 --> 00:35:43,120
But I'm not any more.

424
00:35:47,002 --> 00:35:49,001
You're not armed, Grace, are you?

425
00:35:49,002 --> 00:35:50,921
No, I'm not armed.

426
00:35:52,042 --> 00:35:55,441
I don't carry guns.
I don't have to.

427
00:36:01,203 --> 00:36:03,521
You don't have a sense of humour
any more, either.

428
00:36:03,522 --> 00:36:05,562
What are you talking about?

429
00:36:15,164 --> 00:36:18,803
The thing is, I hate reunions.

430
00:36:19,244 --> 00:36:21,403
I didn't want to sit here
for hours talking about nothing

431
00:36:21,404 --> 00:36:24,603
and dancing around
what we really want to say.

432
00:36:25,204 --> 00:36:26,964
So now,

433
00:36:27,645 --> 00:36:28,883
I know you're happy in New York.

434
00:36:28,884 --> 00:36:31,124
I know your husband's rich
and sweet and kind to you.

435
00:36:31,125 --> 00:36:33,523
I know you're unarmed.

436
00:36:33,765 --> 00:36:37,564
And you didn't come here for sex
because you don't love me any more.

437
00:36:38,685 --> 00:36:40,844
And it's only three minutes past.

438
00:36:42,685 --> 00:36:44,485
Another drink?

439
00:36:47,606 --> 00:36:49,604
I'll take that as a yes.

440
00:36:52,006 --> 00:36:54,885
It's good to see you, Grace.

441
00:36:56,726 --> 00:36:59,005
So you didn't light the fire?

442
00:37:02,886 --> 00:37:05,046
You see, my real plan

443
00:37:07,007 --> 00:37:09,006
was that we go out.

444
00:37:10,407 --> 00:37:12,286
I want to impress you.

445
00:37:12,847 --> 00:37:14,486
Now,

446
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:17,927
do you like Charlie Chaplin?

447
00:37:20,368 --> 00:37:22,087
Yes, I like Charlie Chaplin.

448
00:37:22,168 --> 00:37:23,647
Good.

449
00:37:24,488 --> 00:37:27,167
I bet you've never heard
Charlie Chaplin speak.

450
00:37:29,648 --> 00:37:31,367
I thought you were taking me
to see Charlie Chaplin.

451
00:37:31,368 --> 00:37:32,487
I am.

452
00:37:32,488 --> 00:37:35,447
- This isn't a picture house.
- No, it's not a picture house.

453
00:37:35,448 --> 00:37:38,608
So how will
I see Charlie Chaplin?

454
00:37:38,609 --> 00:37:41,968
You will see him and you will hear him,
just like I promised.

455
00:37:42,769 --> 00:37:44,528
There you go. There's Chaplin.

456
00:37:44,529 --> 00:37:46,208
My God. That's him.

457
00:37:46,209 --> 00:37:47,808
That's really Charlie Chaplin in person.

458
00:37:47,809 --> 00:37:50,929
Yep. He's in England
promoting his film.

459
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:52,488
And how the hell
do you know Charlie Chaplin?

460
00:37:52,489 --> 00:37:55,688
I don't.
I know his bodyguard, Wag McDonald.

461
00:37:55,969 --> 00:37:57,769
It's that chap there.

462
00:37:57,770 --> 00:38:00,849
Wag was a bookie in Birmingham,
then he went to Los Angeles.

463
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:03,169
You see, Wag is also Romani gypsy,

464
00:38:03,170 --> 00:38:05,769
as is Chaplin, but he keeps it a secret.

465
00:38:06,130 --> 00:38:09,609
Chaplin was born on the Black Patch,
a gypsy camp in Birmingham.

466
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:13,169
That's why he gave Wag the job,
even though Wag was on the run.

467
00:38:13,170 --> 00:38:14,850
Thank you.

468
00:38:16,650 --> 00:38:19,570
Thank you.
See, we all have our secrets, Grace.

469
00:38:20,171 --> 00:38:22,650
Come on. I'll introduce you.

470
00:38:25,491 --> 00:38:29,050
Hello, Wag.
Mr Chaplin, this is Grace.

471
00:38:29,291 --> 00:38:31,691
Hello, Mr Chaplin.

472
00:38:38,972 --> 00:38:41,491
- Hello.
- Hello, Mr Campbell.

473
00:38:41,492 --> 00:38:45,292
You said you knew
my sister's address in Primrose Hill,

474
00:38:45,293 --> 00:38:47,492
so I expect you have men
watching the house,

475
00:38:47,493 --> 00:38:49,492
see who comes and goes.

476
00:38:50,052 --> 00:38:52,612
Well, tonight your men
will see me return to the house

477
00:38:52,613 --> 00:38:54,612
with a very beautiful woman.

478
00:38:54,773 --> 00:38:57,773
She will stay
untiljust before midnight.

479
00:38:57,814 --> 00:39:00,413
Of course, I'll close the curtains.

480
00:39:01,494 --> 00:39:03,172
Can you guess who the woman is?

481
00:39:06,174 --> 00:39:07,333
Liar!

482
00:39:07,334 --> 00:39:09,413
Sleep well, Mr Campbell.

483
00:39:19,054 --> 00:39:20,934
Tommy.

484
00:39:22,215 --> 00:39:24,334
Tommy, do you have someone?

485
00:39:32,175 --> 00:39:34,255
It's too late, Tommy.

486
00:39:34,896 --> 00:39:36,494
It's 11:00, Grace.

487
00:39:36,495 --> 00:39:38,575
I mean, it's too late.

488
00:39:41,496 --> 00:39:43,696
If you'd come with me to New York...

489
00:39:44,216 --> 00:39:46,295
I have things to do.

490
00:39:48,336 --> 00:39:51,096
You mean the coin landed the wrong way?

491
00:39:52,216 --> 00:39:54,416
It couldn't have worked.

492
00:39:55,657 --> 00:39:57,656
That was a question.

493
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:10,016
Hey.

494
00:40:10,057 --> 00:40:12,537
Tommy, do you have someone?

495
00:40:15,498 --> 00:40:17,537
I have a racehorse.

496
00:40:18,418 --> 00:40:21,058
She's gonna win the derby.

497
00:41:14,822 --> 00:41:17,421
I'll drive you.

498
00:41:21,742 --> 00:41:23,662
When do you sail back?

499
00:41:26,022 --> 00:41:27,822
We don't know yet.

500
00:41:29,022 --> 00:41:31,142
You don't have a return ticket?

501
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:34,182
This wasn't right, Tommy.

502
00:41:35,303 --> 00:41:37,542
When do you go back, Grace?

503
00:41:42,423 --> 00:41:44,463
They're doing tests on us.

504
00:41:44,464 --> 00:41:46,823
I don't know when they'll be finished.

505
00:41:51,024 --> 00:41:52,982
We're having treatment.

506
00:41:53,704 --> 00:41:55,823
A doctor on Harley Street.

507
00:41:56,464 --> 00:41:58,703
Some new thing, a breakthrough.

508
00:42:01,824 --> 00:42:03,944
We're trying for a baby.

509
00:42:28,226 --> 00:42:30,705
Why did you come here tonight?

510
00:42:36,707 --> 00:42:39,785
The doctor believes
it's surely me who's at fault.

511
00:42:42,307 --> 00:42:43,866
I'm sorry.

512
00:42:47,307 --> 00:42:48,466
It's no one's fault.

513
00:42:48,467 --> 00:42:50,987
I'm tired of that, Tommy.

514
00:43:02,148 --> 00:43:03,987
Can I see you again?

515
00:43:08,068 --> 00:43:09,707
Grace.

516
00:43:14,549 --> 00:43:17,228
You're used to working undercover?

517
00:43:19,109 --> 00:43:21,588
I've never lied to him once.

518
00:43:24,110 --> 00:43:26,188
So tell him the truth.

519
00:43:45,111 --> 00:43:46,870
Put your arms up.

520
00:43:54,791 --> 00:43:57,311
What've we got here then?

521
00:44:01,712 --> 00:44:03,471
Get your fuckin' hands off me.

522
00:44:05,192 --> 00:44:06,751
Here he is.

523
00:44:06,752 --> 00:44:08,991
The King of London Town.

524
00:44:18,513 --> 00:44:19,871
You been enjoying yourself?

525
00:44:19,872 --> 00:44:21,712
Yeah, it's fucking great.

526
00:44:22,313 --> 00:44:24,752
Surrounded by Sabini's men.

527
00:44:24,753 --> 00:44:26,592
Rats everywhere.

528
00:44:27,033 --> 00:44:28,992
Fucking cockneys.

529
00:44:29,753 --> 00:44:32,512
Well, at least you're going
to get what you've always wanted.

530
00:44:32,513 --> 00:44:33,593
And what's that?

531
00:44:33,594 --> 00:44:35,832
Well, you tried to hang yourself twice.

532
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:37,833
Now the King is gonna do it for you.

533
00:44:41,794 --> 00:44:44,393
- I've been a fuckin' idiot.
- Yeah.

534
00:44:45,954 --> 00:44:47,754
I haven't appreciated nothing, John.

535
00:44:47,755 --> 00:44:49,313
Are you fucking repenting or something?

536
00:44:49,314 --> 00:44:51,074
Drawing.

537
00:44:51,515 --> 00:44:52,673
I used to be good at drawing.

538
00:44:52,674 --> 00:44:55,314
Arthur, please, for God's sake,
I don't need this.

539
00:44:55,315 --> 00:44:57,114
I should have listened more in class.

540
00:44:57,115 --> 00:44:59,955
What fucking class?
You were never there.

541
00:45:00,875 --> 00:45:03,114
I used to draw horses.

542
00:45:03,235 --> 00:45:05,514
- Arthur...
- Stallions.

543
00:45:05,515 --> 00:45:07,275
- Great big ones.
- Arthur.

544
00:45:07,276 --> 00:45:10,115
- They looked real.
- Not stallions. Not now.

545
00:45:10,476 --> 00:45:13,475
I should have done more
with me life, John.

546
00:45:13,516 --> 00:45:15,475
- Good things.
- Arthur, for God's sake...

547
00:45:15,476 --> 00:45:16,796
Even Ada said it wasn't my fault.

548
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:18,195
Arthur, will you listen?

549
00:45:18,196 --> 00:45:21,076
- They're gonna hang me, John.
- They're not gonna hang you.

550
00:45:21,077 --> 00:45:22,795
Says who?

551
00:45:24,237 --> 00:45:26,075
Tommy.

552
00:45:29,157 --> 00:45:31,996
And how is Houdini
gonna get me out of this?

553
00:45:31,997 --> 00:45:35,116
- Well, we...
- Don't tell me. He's got a plan.

554
00:45:35,557 --> 00:45:37,437
But you don't know
what that plan is, do you, John?

555
00:45:37,438 --> 00:45:38,596
I do...

556
00:45:38,597 --> 00:45:40,717
'Cause we just can't be trusted.

557
00:45:40,958 --> 00:45:42,396
All right.

558
00:45:42,397 --> 00:45:45,197
If he's so fucking clever,
why am I in here?

559
00:45:45,198 --> 00:45:46,396
Well, it's...

560
00:45:46,397 --> 00:45:49,597
Why is all our men
and half our whisky been lifted?

561
00:45:50,958 --> 00:45:52,997
The Jew and the cockney
have run rings round him.

562
00:45:52,998 --> 00:45:55,117
- Will you shut up?
- Look at you. Look.

563
00:45:55,718 --> 00:45:59,237
- A big fucking man...
- Fucking shut up!

564
00:46:01,439 --> 00:46:03,918
He's already told me
what I've got to do.

565
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,600
What business have you got here?

566
00:46:23,601 --> 00:46:25,039
I just pulled over.

567
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:27,520
I never smoke and drive, you know?

568
00:46:27,521 --> 00:46:30,000
- Where are you from?
- I'm from Ireland,

569
00:46:30,361 --> 00:46:32,639
the beautiful north
where the rocks sing in the wind.

570
00:46:32,640 --> 00:46:34,640
Yeah, in the beautiful north.

571
00:46:34,761 --> 00:46:36,119
You know,
I've just pulled over for a fag.

572
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:38,320
I want to see some identification!

573
00:46:38,441 --> 00:46:40,001
Hey!

574
00:47:20,084 --> 00:47:21,563
Look.

575
00:47:21,724 --> 00:47:23,163
Come!

576
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:27,883
See?

577
00:47:31,764 --> 00:47:35,203
Does it really stop the horses
from getting worms?

578
00:47:35,244 --> 00:47:37,564
Yep. It really does.

579
00:47:42,804 --> 00:47:45,524
Anyway, I thought
it would make you smile.

580
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:48,644
I'm sorry that you had
to drive through the night.

581
00:47:48,645 --> 00:47:51,804
You must be exhausted.
You can go and sleep if you want.

582
00:47:53,526 --> 00:47:55,085
May.

583
00:47:56,686 --> 00:47:58,725
We have to stop.

584
00:47:58,966 --> 00:48:00,525
This.

585
00:48:01,566 --> 00:48:04,325
I came here
to tell you we have to stop.

586
00:48:06,487 --> 00:48:07,886
Why?

587
00:48:08,606 --> 00:48:11,166
Because I'm me and you're you,
that old thing?

588
00:48:11,966 --> 00:48:13,566
There's someone.

589
00:48:16,487 --> 00:48:18,366
For a long time.

590
00:48:23,007 --> 00:48:24,886
And I didn't want you to think
anything about how

591
00:48:24,887 --> 00:48:27,367
it's gonna be after the race.

592
00:48:32,128 --> 00:48:33,647
Not many of your people know about me,

593
00:48:33,648 --> 00:48:36,488
so I haven't done
the damage that would come.

594
00:48:36,489 --> 00:48:38,087
"My people?"

595
00:48:40,609 --> 00:48:42,567
Well, the damage isn't done,

596
00:48:42,568 --> 00:48:44,048
is what I mean.

597
00:48:44,049 --> 00:48:45,887
- Right.
- It's...

598
00:48:47,969 --> 00:48:51,168
Even if it's like this,
I want the horse to stay here.

599
00:48:51,169 --> 00:48:52,928
To stay? Yes, of course.

600
00:48:52,929 --> 00:48:54,208
Epsom is close.

601
00:48:54,209 --> 00:48:56,969
I haven't got my outfit yet
so it's all right.

602
00:48:57,809 --> 00:48:59,929
You can still be
with me at the enclosure.

603
00:48:59,930 --> 00:49:01,848
That's very gracious of you, sir.

604
00:49:02,369 --> 00:49:03,569
You can wear something.

605
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:04,649
It's funny, isn't it?

606
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,809
Because you'll be up there
and I'll be down in the ring.

607
00:49:08,490 --> 00:49:10,609
Sort of upside down, isn't it?

608
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:14,090
You can still be with me after
and you can still wear something.

609
00:49:14,091 --> 00:49:16,369
I'll be covered in mud from the ring.

610
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:21,170
May, forget about men like me.

611
00:49:21,171 --> 00:49:23,411
I was going to tell you
how much he's improved.

612
00:49:28,971 --> 00:49:30,291
There are other men, May.

613
00:49:30,292 --> 00:49:33,371
I think she stands
a chance of placing, so...

614
00:49:33,372 --> 00:49:34,611
That's the silly part
of our business done.

615
00:49:34,612 --> 00:49:37,212
Are you going to drive
straight off to Birmingham? Or...

616
00:49:42,812 --> 00:49:45,131
And what if I said,

617
00:49:45,132 --> 00:49:48,491
"All right, I'll stay,"
after what I just said?

618
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:56,772
Then that would be all right.

619
00:50:01,973 --> 00:50:04,053
You talk about damage.

620
00:50:04,054 --> 00:50:05,252
The damage not yet done.

621
00:50:05,253 --> 00:50:06,573
You don't think that half
of London already thinks

622
00:50:06,574 --> 00:50:08,293
that I'm fucking a racketeer?

623
00:50:09,373 --> 00:50:12,652
Laughing about it. Laying on bets
about when you'll steal the silver.

624
00:50:15,134 --> 00:50:18,093
You think your people are ruthless?
Try mine.

625
00:50:21,734 --> 00:50:24,374
So that's why you carry on?

626
00:50:24,575 --> 00:50:26,894
Because you can't back down.

627
00:50:28,255 --> 00:50:31,534
Amongst many other illogical reasons.

628
00:50:35,375 --> 00:50:37,255
So will you drive straight off or...

629
00:50:37,256 --> 00:50:40,295
I haven't got any petrol in the garage.

630
00:50:43,696 --> 00:50:45,895
Yeah. I have some cans
of petrol in the car.

631
00:50:45,896 --> 00:50:48,015
Good. So you can go.

632
00:51:16,818 --> 00:51:18,697
They look happy in there?

633
00:51:20,498 --> 00:51:22,137
And why wouldn't they be?

634
00:51:35,219 --> 00:51:36,978
Who is she?

635
00:51:38,739 --> 00:51:41,178
Someone who's sailing away.

636
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,819
So let her sail.

637
00:51:55,180 --> 00:51:56,620
You've told me about her
like a gentleman.

638
00:51:56,621 --> 00:51:58,939
Now kindly behave like a gangster again.

639
00:52:03,821 --> 00:52:06,380
Feel sorry for me. It's fine.

640
00:52:16,542 --> 00:52:19,100
Because your horse
will come fifth or sixth.

641
00:52:20,662 --> 00:52:22,700
But I will win you.

642
00:52:30,462 --> 00:52:34,861
Mr Shelby's just parking his car.
He said for you to wait in here.

643
00:52:39,342 --> 00:52:41,582
Isn't this impressive?

644
00:52:42,183 --> 00:52:45,342
And what is it you exactly do here?

645
00:52:46,424 --> 00:52:49,703
I exactly am a secretary to Mr Shelby.

646
00:52:49,704 --> 00:52:52,382
A secretary? My, my, my.

647
00:52:53,344 --> 00:52:55,262
All that paperwork.

648
00:52:57,344 --> 00:52:59,023
Do you want tea?

649
00:52:59,303 --> 00:53:00,704
No.

650
00:53:46,186 --> 00:53:48,706
I keep everything locked up,
Mr Campbell.

651
00:53:48,707 --> 00:53:50,626
Everything of value.

652
00:53:58,627 --> 00:54:00,707
Take a seat.

653
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,947
How is your company treasurer, Polly?

654
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:14,227
- Why do you ask?
- Just give her my regards.

655
00:54:24,549 --> 00:54:27,628
You like to play with fire,

656
00:54:27,709 --> 00:54:29,629
don't you, Mr Shelby?

657
00:54:30,909 --> 00:54:34,069
Yesterday in Belgravia,

658
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:37,749
Field Marshal Russell's
house was burnt out.

659
00:54:37,750 --> 00:54:40,389
An incendiary device was
put through his letterbox,

660
00:54:40,390 --> 00:54:42,069
which means

661
00:54:43,031 --> 00:54:45,869
that he will have to find
somewhere else to live

662
00:54:45,870 --> 00:54:47,949
for at least the next three months.

663
00:54:49,991 --> 00:54:52,669
Which also means that your plan,

664
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:54,670
for me to break in
and shoot him in his bed,

665
00:54:54,671 --> 00:54:56,990
is now no longer
an operational possibility.

666
00:54:56,991 --> 00:54:58,550
Indeed.

667
00:54:58,551 --> 00:55:02,590
But if you think a wee burn
frees you from your obligations,

668
00:55:02,591 --> 00:55:05,870
- think again.
- I will keep my side of the bargain.

669
00:55:05,871 --> 00:55:06,991
By God, you will.

670
00:55:06,992 --> 00:55:08,510
I will shoot your field marshal,

671
00:55:08,511 --> 00:55:11,191
but I will do it in a way
that serves my purpose.

672
00:55:11,192 --> 00:55:13,191
The only purpose is my purpose.

673
00:55:13,192 --> 00:55:16,631
I will carry out your assassination
at a place of my choosing.

674
00:55:18,472 --> 00:55:20,272
Listen to me.

675
00:55:20,673 --> 00:55:23,872
All operational detail
must be mutually agreed.

676
00:55:23,873 --> 00:55:26,672
I'm a soldier. I've experience.
I will determine where and when he...

677
00:55:26,673 --> 00:55:30,152
Now that man has 24-hour
armed police protection...

678
00:55:30,153 --> 00:55:31,992
Your plan was full of holes.

679
00:55:31,993 --> 00:55:33,672
My plan was mutually agreed!

680
00:55:33,673 --> 00:55:35,952
Well, now your plan is up in smoke.

681
00:55:36,073 --> 00:55:39,072
And I have formulated
the only viable alternative.

682
00:55:39,193 --> 00:55:41,353
For God's sake, what do you mean?

683
00:55:42,473 --> 00:55:44,633
How would you get to him?

684
00:55:46,634 --> 00:55:49,393
I won't.
He will come to me.

685
00:55:53,595 --> 00:55:55,873
Now, listen to me, Mr Shelby.

686
00:55:55,874 --> 00:55:57,914
When this meeting is concluded,

687
00:55:57,915 --> 00:56:01,634
I must report directly
to Mr Winston Churchill.

688
00:56:01,915 --> 00:56:05,714
Your relationship with Mr Churchill
is not my concern.

689
00:56:06,316 --> 00:56:10,714
And Mr Winston Churchill
will need to hear detail.

690
00:56:10,795 --> 00:56:13,395
Well, you tell him
he'll have to trust me.

691
00:56:17,276 --> 00:56:19,955
Look, Mr Campbell.

692
00:56:19,956 --> 00:56:22,515
I will carry out my mission.

693
00:56:22,636 --> 00:56:24,195
- Good.
- Good.

694
00:56:24,996 --> 00:56:27,475
But I will do it in a place
where it will be impossible

695
00:56:27,476 --> 00:56:31,995
for you or your men
to have me shot afterwards.

696
00:56:33,677 --> 00:56:35,675
Because that was the plan.

697
00:56:37,317 --> 00:56:39,717
Coppers front and back. No way out.

698
00:56:39,718 --> 00:56:42,156
Me shot dead, dumped in the Thames.

699
00:56:42,237 --> 00:56:44,076
I will do the killing,

700
00:56:44,157 --> 00:56:46,797
but at a place
where that will not be an option.

701
00:56:48,917 --> 00:56:52,957
I've recently become
a racehorse owner, Mr Campbell.

702
00:56:57,318 --> 00:56:58,997
It's...

703
00:57:00,479 --> 00:57:03,238
Well, perhaps you can guess
which one is my horse.

704
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,359
Where and when?

705
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:26,999
Epsom.

706
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:29,199
Derby Day.
