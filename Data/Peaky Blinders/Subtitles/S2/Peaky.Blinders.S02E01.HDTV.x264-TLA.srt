HE CLEARS HIS THROAT

30
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:05,050
I promised my friend
Freddie Thorne

31
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,490
that I'd say a few words
over his grave

32
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:09,220
if he should pass before me.

33
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,170
I made this promise before
he became me brother-in-law -

34
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:19,610
when we were in France,
fighting for the King.

35
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:20,940
Amen.

36
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:25,930
And in the end it wasn't war
that took Freddie.

~ Pestilence took him.

38
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,340
Come here.

39
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:36,570
But Freddie passed on his soul
and his spirit to a new generation

40
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,260
before he was cruelly taken.

41
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,250
We thought, now Freddie's gone,

42
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,300
you might come back to Birmingham.

43
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,050
God, do you know how funny it is

44
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,930
that you've got
chauffeurs in uniform now?

45
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,210
It's just for the occasion, Ada.

46
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,690
Do you know how unfair it is

47
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,780
that you've got four Bugattis
when half the country's starving?

48
00:04:07,420 --> 00:04:10,180
So now they've made you
ashamed of us, eh?

49
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:14,970
Sometimes when I think how I used
to be, it makes me embarrassed.

50
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,730
Karl's with his cousins.

51
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:19,100
I caught 'em trying
to pinch flowers off a grave.

52
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:25,250
Ada, are you coming home?

53
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,660
I'm going home.

54
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,610
It's all right, Poll.
We make Ada embarrassed.

55
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:32,300
That's not what I said.

56
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,570
There's another reason
we want you home.

57
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,330
We're planning an expansion.

58
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,090
I'm taking premises in London...

59
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,370
~ Tommy, it's a funeral,
business can wait. ~ Polly,

60
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,890
if Ada was weeping then I'd stop.

61
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,410
But she's not.

62
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,490
The expansion means
it's going to be dangerous

63
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:52,610
to be a Shelby in London
for a while.

64
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,180
Yeah, well,
I'm not a Shelby anymore.

65
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:00,300
And I'm not a Thorne now, either.

66
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,340
I'm free.

67
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,820
I've got to get Karl home.

68
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:20,050
I told you. Let me do it.

69
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:21,730
It's all right.

70
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:25,100
I'll have some men watch her house
till the danger passes.

71
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:32,580
"Till the danger passes"?

72
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,580
That'll be the bloody day.

73
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,980
THE CHILDREN SHOUT

74
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,610
It happened at exactly 7am.

75
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:20,340
Nobody saw anything.
Our patrols were not in the area.

76
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:25,940
Mr Shelby, have you got
any idea who might've done it?

77
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:31,100
I'd say it was something
to do with the gas.

78
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,660
It's just been fitted.

79
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,690
Madam, the structure's
not yet declared safe.

80
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:43,700
~ DEBRIS CRUNCHES
~ Madam!

81
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,660
This is all over the place.

82
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,140
Confetti.

83
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,210
You can go.

84
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:09,300
Right.

85
00:07:15,220 --> 00:07:16,420
Who?

86
00:07:19,980 --> 00:07:21,540
Who did this to us?

87
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:42,540
Whisky. Irish.

88
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,650
I heard there was a bit of a bang
in your part of town.

89
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,250
Gas and electric don't mix.

90
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,490
Who'd have thought
they would, eh?

91
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,940
How's business otherwise,
Mr Shelby?

92
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,420
You know something?

93
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:13,410

and hardship,

00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,340
business is surprisingly good.

So get 'em in hand.

She said we all look like we work

She said we look like ghosts.

129
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,500
She'll be back.

130
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:53,090
When?

131
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,580
When she needs us.

132
00:10:56,340 --> 00:11:00,410
And anyway, who the fuck
would blow up our pub?

133
00:11:00,460 --> 00:11:03,290
~ Six. ~ Six what?

134
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:06,140
Six questions since
you walked through the door.

135
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:12,300
Soon you're going to have to start
being the man with the answers.

Why?

137
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,580
Seven.

138
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:24,290
Because when London happens,
you'll have to hold up your end

139
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:26,420

A reputation for not being
scared of anything.

146
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:06,820
In all the world, violent men
are the easiest to deal with.

147
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:12,420
So tell me, which brand
of rebel are you, eh?

148
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:15,730
I read somewhere that you Paddies

149
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:18,100
started fighting
amongst yourselves, now.

150
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:24,010
The King offers you a peace treaty
and you start a war about it.

151
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:27,090
That's funny, don't you think?

152
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,860
A war about peace.

153
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,170
So are you for the treaty
or against the treaty?

154
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:38,180
Forgive me, I get confused.

155
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:48,420
You are one decision away
from death, Mr Shelby.

156
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,460
So stop fucking smiling.

157
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,930
Your name is Irene O'Donnell.

158
00:12:56,980 --> 00:13:00,730
You have a son at the
Cherry Wood Road School in Harborne.

159
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,890
He has irons on his legs,
his name is Sean,

160
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:07,740
he comes last
in every race, poor boy.

161
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,970
Poor boy if the race was important.

162
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:15,290
Do you know what I mean,
Irene O'Donnell?

163
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:17,530
There are other ways of
carrying out this mission.

164
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:20,820
Please allow me to put a bullet
in this scum tinker's head.

165
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,580
No.

166
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,450
He researches his enemies,

167
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,700
that's why he's been chosen.

168
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:37,500
I am chosen?

169
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:41,380
I'm chosen.

170
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,220
Can the chosen one smoke?

171
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:03,780
A vacancy has appeared
and you're going to fill it.

172
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,540
Chosen by whom?

173
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,260
By an informed consensus.

174
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:15,420
I have things to do.

175
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,770
So perhaps you could tell
the chosen one

176
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,940
what he's been chosen for.

177
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,490
From now on, Mr Shelby,

178
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:30,460
you shut your fucking Gypsy mouth
and listen to your instructions.

179
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,860
Fuck!

180
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:15,930
I need the area round
the co-operative stables

181
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:19,250
clear of coppers between
midnight and four tonight.

182
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:21,180
Right. Could I ask why?

183
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,810
Well, whatever it is you're
going to do, don't start any fires.

184
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,730
The firemen go out
on strike at midnight.

185
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:33,580
That's all. You can go.

186
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,650
I've got some information
you might be interested in.

187
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,180
No charge.

188
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:48,130
There's an old friend of ours
coming back to the city.

189
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:52,170
Just passing through, he says.

190
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,130
He's very grand these days.

191
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,770
He's head of some
secret department -

192
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,140
the Irish Desk.

193
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:03,740
So I doubt he'll be bothering
with the likes of us, eh?

194
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:07,380
I'll say good night, Tom.

195
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:19,060
I want to speak to a representative!

196
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:24,260
MAN CALLS OUT

197
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,810
Father! Father!

198
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,570
It was the Ulsterman,
the man with the wolf head!

199
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,250
Get the fuck off me!

200
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:38,090
You must reconcile yourself
with the fate that awaits.

201
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,650
I demand to speak to
a representative
of His Majesty the King!

202
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,850
Make your peace with God.

203
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:45,810
A representative of
His Majesty the King!

204
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:48,170
~ Father. ~ Come on.

205
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:49,740
Where are you going?

206
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:55,010
Does someone here have
business with the King?

207
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,610
Major Campbell.

208
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,940
~ SHOUTING CONTINUES
~ About time.

209
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,570
I am a very busy man, Governor.

210
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:05,370
In seven and a half minutes,

211
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:08,890
the man in that cell
is due to be hanged for murder.

212
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:11,810
The murder of an Irish activist
in Whitechapel.

213
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:14,540
Does the case ring any bells,
Major Campbell?

214
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:17,490
No, Governor,

215
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:19,060
I hear no bells.

216
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,410
Since yesterday morning,

217
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,410
he's been claiming that the murder
was ordered

218
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:26,890
by the British
Secret Intelligence Service.

219
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,810
It's a little late to be coming up
with nonsense like that,

220
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,010
don't you think?

221
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,090
He was told if he kept
his mouth shut

222
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:35,370
there would be a last-minute pardon,

223
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:37,260
which has not materialised.

224
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,050
Forgive me, Governor,

225
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,500
but what business is this of mine?

226
00:18:45,380 --> 00:18:47,170
He says the man who hired him

227
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,130
was an Intelligence Service
Chief of Staff,

228
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:51,620
an Ulsterman.

229
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:55,010
Carries a cane
with a wolf-head handle,

230
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,690
a bullet wound in his right leg.

231
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,460
No...

232
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,940
Still no bells. Governor...

233
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:08,570
..you have a very clear remit.

234
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:12,250
Part of that remit is
to oversee the smooth completion

235
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:15,260
of executions
sanctioned by the Crown.

236
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:20,460
And in the next four minutes it is
your duty to escort that man...

237
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,730
..to the gates of hell.

238
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:24,820
Is that clear?

239
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,530
And...if you should ever have
the desire

240
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,060
to discuss this matter
with anyone else...

241
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,980
..I know where you live.

242
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:55,620
Arthur,
Tommy's called a family meeting.

243
00:19:57,300 --> 00:19:58,450
Arthur!

244
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,850
He just beat the shit out of
an apprentice.

245
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,220
I had to take half the kid away
in buckets.

246
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:12,780
Arthur!

247
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,020
2,000.

248
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,420
Come on.

249
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,420
Sit down, Finn.

250
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:06,180
~ Where the bloody hell is Tommy?
~ He's on his way.

251
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,980
All right then,
while we're waiting patiently...

252
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:17,820
Whisky - left over from
the explosion.

253
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,100
It's good stuff, as well.

254
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,490
Right...

255
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,690
Before Tommy gets here,

256
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:42,010
I think there's a few things
we need to get straight

257
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,570
between the rest of us.

258
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:44,740
YOU think?

259
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:46,940
Yeah.

260
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,820
Yeah, I do. I want to know...

261
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,180
..when did we all take a vote
on this expansion south?

262
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:03,450
If you have anything to say,
you wait for Thomas.

263
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,970
Polly's fucking right.

264
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,180
I see all the books.

265
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:10,060
Legal and off track.

266
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,220
Sort of stuff you don't see.

267
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,210
And in the past year

268
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:19,730
the Shelby Company Limited

269
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:24,090
has been making £150...

270
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:25,620
a day.

271
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:29,970
Right? A fucking day.

272
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:31,890
Sometimes more.

273
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,610
So what I want to know

274
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:38,570
is why are we changing things?

275
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,020
Polly, look what's happened already.

276
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:43,930
We haven't even set foot
in London yet

277
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,090
and they've already blown up
our fucking pub.

278
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:48,570
~ Who said anything
about cockneys? ~ Who else?

279
00:22:48,620 --> 00:22:50,530
Do you know who did it, do you?

280
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,700
No, she doesn't know who did it.

281
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:57,170
I'm told only family
are allowed to speak.

282
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,020
Everyone's allowed to speak.

283
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:03,140
On your feet, Esme,
let's hear what you have to say.

284
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,980
I speak for our household.

285
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:12,490
~ So... ~ John, this company
is a modern enterprise

286
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:15,090
and believes in
equal rights for women.

287
00:23:15,140 --> 00:23:16,660
On your feet, Esme.

288
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,330
I'm not a blood member
of this family

289
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,410
but perhaps, indeed,
because I'm NOT a member

290
00:23:35,460 --> 00:23:37,580
I can see things
in a different light.

291
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,250
So I'll get to my point.

292
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:41,970
That would be nice.

293
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,330
As my husband said,

294
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:46,570
Shelby Company Limited
is now very successful.

295
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,890
But London...

296
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,820
I have kin in Shepherd's Bush
and Portobello.

297
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,650
It's more like wars
between armies down there.

298
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:59,290
And the coppers fight
side-by-side with them.

299
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,660
And there are foreigners
of every description...

300
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:06,460
..and the use of bombs
is the least of it.

301
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:11,250
I have a child,

302
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:14,060
blessed with the Shelby family
good looks.

303
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:17,700
I want John to see him grow up.

304
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:23,170
I want us to someday live somewhere
with fresh air and trees

305
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:25,100
and keep chickens or something.

306
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:30,770
But London is just smoke
and trouble, Thomas.

307
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:31,940
"Thomas"?

308
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,100
That's all I have to say.

309
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:43,420
ARTHUR: That was a lot of words,
a lot of words.

310
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,970
Wash them down with a nice drink.

311
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,260
Thank you, Esme.

312
00:24:53,060 --> 00:24:56,210
Firstly, the bang in the pub
was nothing to do with London.

313
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,650
Understood?

314
00:24:57,700 --> 00:25:00,130
The bang is something
I'm dealing with on my own.

315
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:03,730
Secondly, we've nothing to fear
from the proposed business expansion

316
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:05,420
so long as we stick together.

317
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:08,610
And after the first few weeks,

318
00:25:08,660 --> 00:25:11,090
nine tenths of what we do in London
will be legal.

319
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:14,570
The other tenth is in good hands.
Isn't that right, Arthur?

320
00:25:14,620 --> 00:25:15,740
That's right.

321
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:20,450
Now, some of you in this room
have expressed their reservations.

322
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,730
Fair enough.

323
00:25:21,780 --> 00:25:24,930
Any of you who want no part
in the future of this company,

324
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,460
walk out the door...

325
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,020
..right now.

326
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,140
Go raise your chickens.

327
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:39,700
For those of you with ambition...

328
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:43,220
..the expansion process
begins tomorrow.

329
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,170
Tomorrow?

330
00:25:58,220 --> 00:26:01,260
I'm company treasurer,
you should speak to me first.

331
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:06,170
It's Newmarket tomorrow,
third busiest day of the year.

332
00:26:06,220 --> 00:26:07,770
We have 18 staff.

333
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:10,170
Who you trust with 200 quid takings?

334
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:12,180
Oh, I changed the combination.

335
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,620
So what's going on, Thomas?

336
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,700
Who'd you meet at the Black Lion?

337
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:26,340
Give me the combination, Polly.

338
00:26:32,660 --> 00:26:36,060
Polly, give me the combination!

339
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:45,370
What happened to the pub
is Irish business.

340
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:47,890
We're in a situation where,
for everyone's safety,

341
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,180
it's best if some things
remain undisclosed.

342
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,580
So why tomorrow?

343
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,610
Like you say,
tomorrow's Newmarket.

344
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:00,050
All the London bosses
will be at the races.

345
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:02,450
What, so you just roll up
and take the city?

346
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:05,780
No, we take the opportunity
to show our hand.

347
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,890
The Italian gangs
and the Jewish gangs

348
00:27:10,940 --> 00:27:12,970
have been at war in London
for six months.

349
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:14,090
It's not our war.

350
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:16,730
The Jews have been having
the worst of it. They need allies.

351
00:27:16,780 --> 00:27:19,050
~ Yeah, but we don't.
~ We need a foothold

352
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:21,170
at the southern end
of the Grand Union.

353
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:23,180
The Jews control Camden Town.

354
00:27:31,420 --> 00:27:33,130
Your mother said,

355
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:35,460
"It's his cleverness
that'll kill him."

356
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,610
No-one gets killed, Polly.

357
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:43,010
We go down tomorrow when it's quiet
and we leave our message.

358
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:46,490
If Alfie Solomon
and his Camden boys come to us,

359
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:49,010
we'll negotiate the use
of a secure bonded warehouse

360
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:51,890
and then our legal activities
in London can begin.

361
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:55,540
Now please, open the fucking safe.

362
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:05,140
Do you know, it was a fine speech
you made in there...

363
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:09,780
..about this company believing
in equal rights for women.

364
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,730
But when it comes to it,

365
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,660
you don't listen to a word we say.

366
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:17,860
Maybe you don't trust us.

367
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:22,500
She was one woman, Thomas.

368
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:31,770
Well, maybe it's time
you forgot about her.

369
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,530
Forgot about who?

370
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:36,610
SHE SIGHS

371
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:39,180
SHE UNLOCKS THE SAFE

372
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:50,460
You and the boys,
go and get yourselves killed.

373
00:29:03,060 --> 00:29:05,380
GRUNTING

374
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,700
HE EXHALES

375
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,100
Are you going to London now?

376
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:49,300
No, there's something
I have to do first.

377
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:53,130
Oh, I've got a typewriter like that.

378
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,290
I got it out of a catalogue.

379
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:57,820
I'm doing a correspondence course.

380
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:03,330
I'm learning to do it
with my eyes shut.

381
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:04,980
It's a test you have to do.

382
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,260
Will you come back before you go?

383
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:20,100
No.

384
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:40,810
I wish, just once,
you wouldn't pay me,

385
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,890
as if we were ordinary people.

386
00:30:42,940 --> 00:30:44,020
Yeah.

387
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,850
Let's begin.

388
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,540
Hands on the table.

389
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:01,810
Tonight we have two
new pilgrims joining us.

390
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,020
So, let's welcome them.

391
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,330
Starting with you.

392
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:14,530
Who is it that
you're seeking to reach?

393
00:32:14,580 --> 00:32:16,650
My husband.

394
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:20,250
He was taken six months ago
by the influenza.

395
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:23,810
I tried to reach him through
Mrs Breach at Sparkhill

396
00:32:23,860 --> 00:32:26,570
but she kept getting
his middle name wrong.

397
00:32:26,620 --> 00:32:29,500
Don't talk about Mrs Breach
in this house.

398
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,900
She's an un-sanctified charlatan.

399
00:32:38,380 --> 00:32:40,020
And you?

400
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:43,540
Who do you seek?

401
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,970
Well, the truth...

402
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,730
Sorry, the truth is,
I'm not even sure she's dead.

403
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:52,220
So I came here to find out.

404
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,780
Er...

405
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,530
You see, my son and my daughter

406
00:33:03,580 --> 00:33:06,370
were taken from me
when they were very small -

407
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:07,850
taken by the parish authorities.

408
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:10,570
And I never knew
what happened to them.

409
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:14,100
But lately...

410
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:17,420
I've had a feeling.

411
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,860
Like, a feeling...

412
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:26,820
I can't put it into words.

413
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:31,060
And I keep having a dream.

414
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:38,050
I see a pretty girl,

415
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,740
about 18 years old.

416
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:44,140
And she's standing
across the street...

417
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:50,530
..and she tells me
she's passed over.

418
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:54,580
Now, my daughter
would have been 18 this year.

419
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:57,900
On May 15th.

420
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:06,980
And this girl has dark eyes
like mine.

421
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:15,380
And she shouts...and shouts.

422
00:34:17,220 --> 00:34:21,130
And she tells me
she wants to talk to me

423
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,900
because I'm her mother.

424
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:32,090
Now, I don't even know
what name they gave her

425
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:34,060
after they stole her from me.

426
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,740
But if she does want
to say goodbye...

427
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,940
I thought this would be the place.

428
00:34:46,860 --> 00:34:49,650
You're wearing the Black Madonna.

429
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,820
You're Gypsy?

430
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,860
The part of me that dreams is Gypsy.

431
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:11,820
My maiden name is Shelby.

432
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,740
So...

433
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,500
..perhaps you could do me first.

434
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:35,420
No!

435
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:39,930
SHE YELLS

436
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:41,540
No!

437
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,940
NO!

438
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:53,900

All right, Tommy's here.

Hang on!

460
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:29,770
John!

461
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,980
I'm coming!

462
00:38:39,180 --> 00:38:42,010
7 o'clock, 12 o'clock,

463
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:43,930
10 if I'm still sober.

464
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:46,290
I got it from the doctor -

465
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:49,060
it keeps me nice and calm.

466
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,850
Same thing they gave us
in the trenches

467
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,410
to stop us fucking wanking.

468
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,290
Polly said it's good for me temper.

469
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:59,330
~ It slows me down, Tom. ~ Arthur...

470
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:02,370
there are some things
Polly doesn't understand.

471
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:06,050
~ I need you fast. Not slow, eh?
~ DOOR OPENS

472
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,050
She wouldn't let go
of my fucking leg.

473
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,530
~ I bet that's not all
she wouldn't let go of! ~ Right.

474
00:39:10,580 --> 00:39:13,690
You know she's against this, Tom.
She's got opinions.

475
00:39:13,740 --> 00:39:15,330
Nothing wrong with opinions, John.

476
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,980
~ Get in the fucking car. ~ Shut up!

477
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,970
ARTHUR SHOUTS: Right!

478
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:26,690
The Peaky Blinders are going
on fucking holiday!

479
00:39:26,740 --> 00:39:28,180
Sit down, you mad bastard.

DOOR CLOSES

481
00:39:53,580 --> 00:39:56,260
You're against this
the same as me, aren't you?

482
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:01,090
Look out for anyone putting
big money on Divine Star

483
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,700
in the 3:30 at Newmarket.

484
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,930
She's one of ours.

485
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,860
Anything over £1, tell me.

486
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,980
Polly...

487
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:20,770
I don't wish to pry
into your business

488
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:23,650
but you should know something.

489
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:26,410
That woman is a trickster.

490
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:28,170
What woman?

491
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:31,250
Her sister was in
the wash house early,

492
00:40:31,300 --> 00:40:33,980
boasting there'd been
a Shelby at the table.

493
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:38,980
What woman?

494
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:41,780
Gypsies talk to each other.

495
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:45,580
What woman?

496
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:51,060
You went to see Mrs Price
in the Patch last night.

497
00:40:56,300 --> 00:40:58,130
I'm sorry...

498
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,970
So what do you know?

499
00:41:00,020 --> 00:41:01,930
I know they push the glass.

500
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:04,450
The man, it's her cousin.
He pushes the glass.

501
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,850
It's a trick.

502
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,180
They tell you what
you already believe.

503
00:41:10,020 --> 00:41:13,490
She set up after the war
because of all the widows.

504
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:17,250
Polly, I just thought
you should know.

505
00:41:17,300 --> 00:41:19,050
And in this fucking wash house,

506
00:41:19,100 --> 00:41:20,780
did they tell you why I went there?

507
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:31,290
You tell a soul in this family,

508
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:35,300
and I swear I will cut you.

509
00:41:37,180 --> 00:41:41,340
I don't need a knife to stop me
telling secrets given in confidence.

510
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,380
It is a matter of honour.

511
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,330
Look at this! Look.

512
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,970
I love it.

513
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,410
Your Esme was right
about one thing -

514
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:14,530
you can't beat the countryside.

515
00:42:14,580 --> 00:42:18,300
You know, I think I want
to live in the country one day...

516
00:42:19,340 --> 00:42:20,850
..and keep chickens.

517
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:23,420
Yeah, we'll see you
in London, Arthur.

518
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:30,580
~ Oh, for fuck's sake! ~ Take these.

519
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,490
We need to bury him.

520
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:37,530
Who the fuck is that?

521
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:39,010
It's Irish business.

522
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:41,650
I thought it best
if I deal with it on my own.

523
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:44,210
Come on, we did a thousand
of these in France.

524
00:42:44,260 --> 00:42:46,010
John, grab his head.

525
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:48,650
So, we're not really
going to London?

526
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,450
Once we bury him,

527
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,260
then the holiday begins.

528
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:02,010
GIGGLING

529
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:04,540

530
00:43:18,260 --> 00:43:19,540
Much obliged.

BAND PLAYS ENERGETICALLY

532
00:43:29,060 --> 00:43:31,260
It's a fucking freak show.

533
00:43:51,020 --> 00:43:53,530
What the fuck is that racket?

534
00:43:53,580 --> 00:43:56,700
~ This is what they call music
these days, brother. ~ Music?!

535
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:15,490
Oi!

536
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:17,930
Oi! Put it away.

537
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:19,260
Fuck off!

538
00:44:24,380 --> 00:44:26,410
Fucking look at this spot, eh?

539
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,260
It's all right, isn't it?

540
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:36,290
Irish whisky - a bottle.

541
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,580
And hurry up!

542
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:41,930
MUSIC DROWNS SPEECH

543
00:44:41,980 --> 00:44:43,450
Fucking hell,

544
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:45,420
I recognise a few of these lads.

545
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:50,690
That's Sabini's cousin, over there.

546
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:53,410
That's right, Arthur,
it's Sabini's club.

547
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:56,810
Jesus Christ,
everybody in here's a fucking face.

548
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:00,420
Just the lieutenants, John.
No sign of the officers.

549
00:45:02,580 --> 00:45:04,100
Right, let's line them up.

550
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,500
Holiday!

551
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,530
Gentlemen, there's been a mistake.

552
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:13,540
I'm afraid you're going to
have to leave.

553
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:16,770
We just bought a fucking bottle.

554
00:45:16,820 --> 00:45:20,010
Some of the men here recognise you
from the racetracks in the north.

555
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,610
Yeah, we get that a lot.

556
00:45:22,660 --> 00:45:25,810
They say you have no business
coming south of the line

557
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:27,650
without prior agreement.

558
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,900
And what line would that be,
my friend?

559
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:33,500
They say this is provocation.

560
00:45:35,060 --> 00:45:38,220
Right, well, you tell them
we're on holiday.

561
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:41,820
You're breaking the rules.

562
00:45:43,820 --> 00:45:46,890
They say you are
the Peaky Blinders...

563
00:45:46,940 --> 00:45:48,500
MAN SHOUTS: Peaky scum!

564
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:54,660
BAND CONTINUES PLAYING

565
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:13,620
~ HE LAUGHS
~ Who the fuck's next?

566
00:46:16,980 --> 00:46:18,140
Come here!

567
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:26,930
PEOPLE SHRIEK

568
00:46:26,980 --> 00:46:28,620
Put some ice on 'em!

569
00:46:32,900 --> 00:46:34,300
Get out.

570
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,180
Yeah?

571
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:43,130
Yeah?

572
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:44,620
Are you going to use that?

573
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:50,540
Didn't think so.

574
00:47:07,900 --> 00:47:09,770
We came here...

575
00:47:09,820 --> 00:47:11,820
not to make enemies...

576
00:47:13,420 --> 00:47:14,460
No!

577
00:47:15,940 --> 00:47:18,380
We came here to make new friends.

578
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:25,570
Those of you who are last

579
00:47:25,620 --> 00:47:27,660
will soon be first.

580
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:34,170
And those of you who are downtrodden

581
00:47:34,220 --> 00:47:35,580
will rise up.

582
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:38,780
Yip.

583
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:41,860
You know where to find us.

584
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:52,490
I think I've lost a tooth.

585
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:54,940
I'll have none left at this rate!

586
00:47:56,140 --> 00:47:57,850
Some fucking holiday this is.

587
00:47:57,900 --> 00:48:01,490
Yeah? You all right without
your fucking medicine, Arthur?

588
00:48:01,540 --> 00:48:03,370
~ Here, this'll fix you. ~ Give me that!

589
00:48:03,420 --> 00:48:05,490
You, John boy...eh? How are you?

590
00:48:05,540 --> 00:48:08,410
~ Or should I ask your fucking wife?
~ Oh, give over!

591
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,810
No more talk of chickens,
do you hear me?

592
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:11,930
Fuck the chickens.

593
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,570
I've 50 quid in me pocket.

594
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:15,130
Let's paint the town, eh?

595
00:48:15,180 --> 00:48:17,250
JOHN CHEERS

596
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:19,300
~ KNOCK ON DOOR
~ Come.

597
00:48:23,060 --> 00:48:28,050
~ Oh, dear God! ~ Good Lord,
I assumed it was Betty with tea.

598
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:31,810
Forgive me, sir, but your secretary
was not at the desk.

599
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:35,290
No, because she takes lunch -
like normal people.

600
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:36,810
And you can turn around,

601
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:39,450
this lady is
a professional life model.

602
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,020
She does this for a living.

603
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:45,210
I'm more than happy
to come back later, sir.

604
00:48:45,260 --> 00:48:48,100
No, no, no. Later on
I'm in the house. Just, erm...

605
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,450
..keep your back turned,
if you must.

606
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:54,820
MAJOR CAMPBELL MUMBLES

607
00:48:57,220 --> 00:49:01,460
I would guess you haven't been
exposed to Bohemian society, Major?

608
00:49:03,140 --> 00:49:06,450
Well, I...I...play cards on occasion.

609
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:11,250
You're a stranger to cocaine
and exotic dancing, too, I imagine.

610
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:15,250
I find the more obvious vices
the easiest to resist.

611
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:19,980
It's the sneaky little obscure ones
that bring you to your knees, yes?

612
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:25,050
So what business is so urgent
it trumps lunch?

613
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:27,050
Well, sir, our man in Birmingham

614
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,610
has passed his first test
with flying colours.

615
00:49:29,660 --> 00:49:31,530
Oh, I'm horrible at faces.

616
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:36,970
So I think we can begin to
prepare him for the bigger task.

617
00:49:37,020 --> 00:49:40,730
~ Expressions elude me,
I think too much. ~ Sir?

618
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:46,810
I need your authority
to proceed with all urgency

619
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:50,610
in preparing the new man
for the bigger task.

620
00:49:50,660 --> 00:49:53,570
You're talking about
your bookmaker.

621
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:54,650
Yes, sir.

622
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,980
You have a history with this man.
Why did you choose him?

623
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:03,410
To apply pressure on a man
for this type of work

624
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:05,010
you have to know his weaknesses

625
00:50:05,060 --> 00:50:08,930
and I know this man's weaknesses
intimately.

626
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:11,090
And after "mission accomplished",

627
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:14,210
do we trust him
to keep his mouth shut?

628
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:15,980
Absolutely not, sir.

629
00:50:17,340 --> 00:50:19,770
So when he's served his purpose,

630
00:50:19,820 --> 00:50:21,730
he will be consigned to history

631
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:24,010
in exactly the same way
as his predecessor.

632
00:50:24,060 --> 00:50:27,570
You mean at the end of a rope?

633
00:50:27,620 --> 00:50:29,050
Well, the end of the rope

634
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:33,300
has been this man's destiny
since the night he was born.

635
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:02,450
DOOR OPENS

636
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,900
You're early.

637
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:07,410
Shut your eyes, Lizzie.

638
00:51:07,460 --> 00:51:08,730
What?

639
00:51:08,780 --> 00:51:11,660
Shut your eyes.
Go on, shut your eyes.

640
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:14,650
Good.

641
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,330
Now, come with me.

642
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,850
No, shut your eyes!

643
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:21,170
~ SHE LAUGHS
~ This way. ~ What are you doing, Tom?

644
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:23,420
You've got to sit down
here. Right...

645
00:51:24,620 --> 00:51:28,570
Sit down. Now, OK...

646
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:30,770
~ Type this. ~ Why?

647
00:51:30,820 --> 00:51:32,290
Lizzie, type this.

648
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:35,930
"If wi..." Put your cigarette down.

649
00:51:35,980 --> 00:51:37,850
Right. "If winter comes..."

650
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:42,530
~ SHE STARTS TYPING
~ "..then can spring be far behind?"

651
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:45,890
Why?! Did you say spring?

652
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:48,660
Lizzie, what comes after winter?

653
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,410
Let's see.

654
00:51:53,460 --> 00:51:55,690
That's a question.
Where's the question mark?

655
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:58,050
Put in the question mark.

656
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,970
Now type this.

657
00:52:00,020 --> 00:52:03,330
"Wanted - secretary
for expanding business."

658
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:04,730
Slow down!

659
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:07,380
"Must be able to take dictation
and touch-type."

660
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:11,610
"Five days a week.

661
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:14,050
"Eight pounds
and four shillings a month.

662
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:16,420
"Must be able to start immediately."

663
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:19,140
Are you serious?

664
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:25,100
Things are starting
to happen, Lizzie.

665
00:52:26,900 --> 00:52:29,860
I need someone who can
look the other way sometimes.

666
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:40,020
And you can stop
the other work too, Lizzie.

667
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,100
All of it this time.

668
00:52:45,140 --> 00:52:46,340
No exceptions.

669
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:55,690
Eight o'clock, Monday morning,
the upstairs office.

670
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:56,820
Don't be late.

671
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:09,490
DOOR OPENS

672
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:11,890
Newmarket was profitable.

673
00:53:11,940 --> 00:53:14,850
Arthur told me
how you left your message.

674
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:17,490
And when I asked him
where his medicine was,

675
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:19,530
he said you poured it away.

676
00:53:19,580 --> 00:53:22,650
All I poured away was opium
and bromide.

677
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:25,170
Oh, that's how it works
in London, isn't it?

678
00:53:25,220 --> 00:53:28,010
Every boss has to have
a mad dog at his side.

679
00:53:28,060 --> 00:53:31,450
Yeah, somebody who can't be
predicted, somebody mad in the head.

680
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,490
But Thomas Shelby
uses his own brother.

681
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:36,300
~ Stop fucking fighting me!
~ Somebody has to.

682
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:39,370
That arrived an hour ago.

683
00:53:39,420 --> 00:53:43,010
There's no name on it
but it comes from Camden Town.

684
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:44,410
I was going to burn it.

685
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,850
I should have.

686
00:53:45,900 --> 00:53:49,130
Well done, Tommy,
you've picked a side.

687
00:53:49,180 --> 00:53:51,020
Now you're at war with Sabini.

688
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:33,370
Ada, are you coming for a drink?

689
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:36,130
No, the woman upstairs
is looking after Karl.

690
00:54:36,180 --> 00:54:37,740
She goes mad if I'm late!

691
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,290
Ada Shelby?

692
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:11,460
No.

693
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:15,820
THEY GRUNT

694
00:55:19,860 --> 00:55:21,690
Your brother broke the rules.

695
00:55:21,740 --> 00:55:23,210
I don't have a fucking brother.

696
00:55:23,260 --> 00:55:25,730
Me and my friends here need
a bit of female company.

697
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:27,330
~ Let's go for a drive. ~ No!

698
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:29,780
~ Hold her steady, boys. ~ Get off!

699
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:37,820
SHE YELLS

700
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:42,860
Fucking hold him!

00:55:49,780 --> 00:55:52,260
TOMMY GROANS

702
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:16,890
Tommy Shelby,
I missed you at my club.

703
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:19,130
I was at the races.

704
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:20,700
Sabini.

705
00:56:23,140 --> 00:56:24,660
Don't say my name.

706
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:27,610
Jesus!

707
00:56:27,660 --> 00:56:31,620
Franco,
take my name out of his mouth.

708
00:56:33,580 --> 00:56:36,380
TOMMY GROANS AND GURGLES

709
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:43,450
While you're in there,
do a bit of digging for gold.

710
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:44,610
Pay for the petrol.

711
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:47,420
HE MOANS

712
00:56:51,540 --> 00:56:54,340
HE SPLUTTERS

713
00:57:00,460 --> 00:57:02,610
You see how much I know about you?

714
00:57:02,660 --> 00:57:05,340
I even know what's in
