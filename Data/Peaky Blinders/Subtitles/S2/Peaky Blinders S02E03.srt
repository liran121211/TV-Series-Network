1
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:19,440
He was murdered this morning
in a street show in the Patch.

2
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:22,761
He was Irish. Is he a person of interest
to your department, sir?

3
00:01:22,762 --> 00:01:24,602
Do you read the papers?

4
00:01:24,603 --> 00:01:26,483
Birmingham papers.

5
00:01:26,764 --> 00:01:28,924
I recommend the DailyMail.

6
00:01:28,925 --> 00:01:31,004
It will broaden your mind.

7
00:01:32,446 --> 00:01:36,646
Now, if you read the national press,
you would know

8
00:01:36,647 --> 00:01:40,207
that the king has offered
the rebel Irish a treaty.

9
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:42,528
Now, some of the Fenians
want to accept it.

10
00:01:42,529 --> 00:01:44,449
The IRA do not.

11
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:49,211
Now, the IRA have a long
and glorious relationship

12
00:01:49,212 --> 00:01:50,491
with the garrotte.

13
00:01:51,452 --> 00:01:52,932
Dear.

14
00:01:53,133 --> 00:01:55,893
Are they fighting amongst
themselves, are they, sir?

15
00:01:59,055 --> 00:02:00,695
- That will be all.
- Right, sir.

16
00:02:00,696 --> 00:02:03,736
Moss, I'm going to be up and down
from London quite a bit.

17
00:02:03,737 --> 00:02:06,137
I'm going to need some lodgings.
Can you help me with that?

18
00:02:06,138 --> 00:02:07,737
Well, you wouldn't want
to stay in the lodgings

19
00:02:07,738 --> 00:02:10,258
you had last time then, sir?

20
00:02:10,499 --> 00:02:12,299
Too many bad memories, I suppose.

21
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:14,099
You should understand, Moss,

22
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:17,901
I have no regrets about
my previous mission in this city.

23
00:02:18,262 --> 00:02:19,461
No, sir?

24
00:02:19,662 --> 00:02:24,823
I imagine you boys
have quite a laugh at my expense.

25
00:02:24,824 --> 00:02:26,064
A laugh, sir?

26
00:02:26,065 --> 00:02:29,305
You think it's funny
that I developed feelings?

27
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,225
No idea what you're talking about, sir.

28
00:02:31,226 --> 00:02:36,107
I have no regrets about what
happened with Miss Burgess.

29
00:02:36,108 --> 00:02:38,548
No "bad memories".

30
00:02:39,949 --> 00:02:41,509
Right, sir.

31
00:02:45,111 --> 00:02:47,391
He's losing his bloody mind.

32
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:11,600
Next.

33
00:03:28,847 --> 00:03:30,046
All right, then.

34
00:03:30,047 --> 00:03:31,967
Name?

35
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,527
The Digbeth Kid.

36
00:03:35,249 --> 00:03:36,928
The Dig...

37
00:03:36,929 --> 00:03:38,489
What are you? A boxer?

38
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:42,330
Digbeth Kid like Billy the Kid.

39
00:03:46,773 --> 00:03:48,653
Spend a lot of time at the pictures?

40
00:03:49,654 --> 00:03:51,934
Cowboy pictures? Tom Mix?

41
00:03:51,935 --> 00:03:53,254
Yeah?

42
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:57,696
What are you...

43
00:03:57,697 --> 00:04:00,817
Wait, wait. It's not a real gun.

44
00:04:01,338 --> 00:04:03,938
- Let's have a look then?
- It's made of wood.

45
00:04:09,101 --> 00:04:12,381
Bang. Bang.

46
00:04:12,782 --> 00:04:14,222
Very nice.

47
00:04:14,423 --> 00:04:16,903
Where did you get the gun belt?

48
00:04:17,144 --> 00:04:20,264
My sister made it out of
an old blacksmith's apron.

49
00:04:20,785 --> 00:04:22,464
My mum did most of the stitching.

50
00:04:22,826 --> 00:04:24,065
She's not my real mum, but...

51
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:26,266
She does what mothers do.

52
00:04:26,547 --> 00:04:28,267
So she made you a gun belt.

53
00:04:28,428 --> 00:04:30,067
All right then, mother's boy.

54
00:04:30,068 --> 00:04:32,188
There's the door. On you go.
We're looking for...

55
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:35,069
Have you ever been arrested?

56
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,549
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

57
00:04:38,911 --> 00:04:40,431
- No.
- Good.

58
00:04:41,512 --> 00:04:45,152
You're the first bloke we've had in
here today with no criminal record.

59
00:04:45,153 --> 00:04:47,513
Arthur, we can stand him up.

60
00:04:47,514 --> 00:04:48,994
Do you know what that means?

61
00:04:50,155 --> 00:04:54,596
The new Home Secretary wants something
done about illegal gambling.

62
00:04:54,597 --> 00:04:56,196
Damn right.

63
00:04:56,197 --> 00:04:57,597
About bloody time.

64
00:04:57,598 --> 00:05:01,598
So we help our coppers make their quota
of convictions by having men stood up

65
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:03,119
to be arrested.

66
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,800
First offence, you'll get a week inside.

67
00:05:06,121 --> 00:05:08,921
We'll give you five quid
for your trouble.

68
00:05:08,922 --> 00:05:11,042
How does that sound, cowboy?

69
00:05:11,043 --> 00:05:12,362
Yeah.

70
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:18,364
Good. Write your address down
for Finn on your way out.

71
00:05:21,246 --> 00:05:22,446
I can't write.

72
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,846
That's all right, Finn can't read.

73
00:05:24,847 --> 00:05:25,927
Don't worry.

74
00:05:25,928 --> 00:05:28,728
Just tell him your address
and we'll send someone round.

75
00:05:28,969 --> 00:05:32,849
If the sheriff don't run you
out of town first.

76
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:41,132
Good man.

77
00:05:42,414 --> 00:05:46,054
I don't know, Tom. Kids these days.

78
00:05:48,176 --> 00:05:49,815
They didn't fight.

79
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,816
So they're different.

80
00:05:52,217 --> 00:05:53,937
They stay kids.

81
00:05:57,779 --> 00:05:59,339
How was it?

82
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,700
I was starving,
so I would have eaten anything.

83
00:06:03,021 --> 00:06:05,181
But really it was super.

84
00:06:06,662 --> 00:06:08,142
Super.

85
00:06:10,423 --> 00:06:12,983
So, are you a cook?

86
00:06:14,025 --> 00:06:16,064
Not a cook. No.

87
00:06:23,188 --> 00:06:24,908
The man who came to the house,

88
00:06:24,909 --> 00:06:27,869
he was driving a posh car.
He looks rich.

89
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,069
What does he do?

90
00:06:30,871 --> 00:06:33,310
- He works with horses.
- Really?

91
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:35,551
I love horses.

92
00:06:36,553 --> 00:06:38,312
- I've got a bay mare.
- No!

93
00:06:38,313 --> 00:06:40,433
I ride it all the time.

94
00:06:41,754 --> 00:06:42,954
Then it's in the blood.

95
00:06:48,357 --> 00:06:50,156
I've got about a million questions.

96
00:06:50,397 --> 00:06:51,837
So do I.

97
00:06:52,598 --> 00:06:54,758
I've had different pictures in my head.

98
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:56,879
Well, here I am.

99
00:07:18,888 --> 00:07:21,727
It's all right that it's me, isn't it?

100
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:24,368
I don't have any choice.

101
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:28,930
I mean, you are who you are, aren't you?

102
00:07:29,891 --> 00:07:31,691
We don't choose.

103
00:07:31,932 --> 00:07:33,612
And that's it.

104
00:07:34,933 --> 00:07:36,853
Yeah, that's right.

105
00:07:39,175 --> 00:07:41,094
God gave you to me.

106
00:07:43,536 --> 00:07:45,536
People took you away.

107
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:51,538
And it is all right
that it's me, isn't it?

108
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,739
In a place like this.

109
00:07:56,941 --> 00:07:58,061
I thought it would be worse.

110
00:08:01,142 --> 00:08:03,062
Run for the hills!
It's the Digbeth Kid!

111
00:08:03,063 --> 00:08:06,383
Get out of town, kid,
or I will shoot your fucking head off!

112
00:08:06,384 --> 00:08:08,264
Time's up!

113
00:08:08,265 --> 00:08:10,265
- You're dead, go down.
- John!

114
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:25,550
All right then, Polly.

115
00:08:26,071 --> 00:08:27,631
Who's this?

116
00:08:28,552 --> 00:08:31,832
Gentlemen, this is your cousin.

117
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,633
Polly's son, Michael.

118
00:08:43,237 --> 00:08:44,397
Pleased to meet you.

119
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:45,597
John.

120
00:08:45,838 --> 00:08:47,398
I'm Arthur. You've already met me.

121
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:50,559
I used to throw you out of the window,
so John could catch you.

122
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,560
I used to put you in a shoebox
and kick you down Watery Lane.

123
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:57,681
I bet you're glad to be back.

124
00:08:57,682 --> 00:08:59,602
I don't remember any of it.

125
00:08:59,603 --> 00:09:01,723
All I remember is the day
they took me away.

126
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:16,488
Well, you're here now, son.

127
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:19,409
Welcome to the Shelby family.

128
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:21,089
Later on, we'll show you the ropes.

129
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:23,290
Yeah, we'll show you what's what.

130
00:09:25,252 --> 00:09:27,732
Let's leave him be for now?

131
00:09:28,053 --> 00:09:29,732
Come on, boys.

132
00:09:30,694 --> 00:09:32,854
Nice suit.

133
00:09:37,896 --> 00:09:39,616
They seem nice.

134
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,300
Here he is, Mr Inconspicuous.

135
00:09:51,301 --> 00:09:54,301
Corporal Billy Kitchen.
Bloody grand to see you.

136
00:09:54,782 --> 00:09:56,302
How are you feeling?

137
00:09:56,303 --> 00:09:57,782
I've just come out of bandages myself.

138
00:09:57,783 --> 00:09:59,943
Ready for active service.

139
00:09:59,944 --> 00:10:01,584
Thanks for seeing me here, Tommy.

140
00:10:01,585 --> 00:10:02,744
It's all right, Bill.

141
00:10:02,745 --> 00:10:04,242
You don't have to stand in line for us.

142
00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:06,225
It's men like you
we're looking for, Billy.

143
00:10:06,226 --> 00:10:08,306
But you have to pass the medical first.

144
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:13,308
Sheffield mob showed up
at Wincanton trotting track.

145
00:10:13,309 --> 00:10:15,108
I took a bullet.

146
00:10:18,311 --> 00:10:20,190
When do the bandages come off?

147
00:10:20,191 --> 00:10:22,151
When I take 'em off.

148
00:10:22,632 --> 00:10:24,392
One week. Not before.

149
00:10:24,393 --> 00:10:26,232
You'll smell no rot.

150
00:10:26,353 --> 00:10:28,313
There's no gangrene.

151
00:10:29,114 --> 00:10:31,434
It's been a long time. Billy?

152
00:10:32,596 --> 00:10:34,275
What did you do with your medals?

153
00:10:34,556 --> 00:10:37,996
Threw them in the cut. Same as you.

154
00:10:39,158 --> 00:10:43,438
It was never a hardship having you
Black Country boys on our left flank.

155
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,759
And you Brummies did all right
on our right.

156
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,320
Damn right.

157
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:50,721
I want you to be the head
of a brigade, Bill.

158
00:10:51,842 --> 00:10:54,802
It'll be Brigadier Kitchen from now on.

159
00:10:54,803 --> 00:10:57,723
You'll have 100 men under your command.

160
00:10:58,885 --> 00:11:02,085
And now we've got a member of
the Kitchen family on the payroll,

161
00:11:02,086 --> 00:11:05,326
maybe your cousins and brothers will let
our boats pass through the Black Country

162
00:11:05,327 --> 00:11:07,247
without being held up and robbed.

163
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,768
I don't know what you're talking about.

164
00:11:10,409 --> 00:11:11,608
Go home, Bill.

165
00:11:11,609 --> 00:11:14,809
Round up any good men you can trust
and put the word out.

166
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,011
Black Country boys and Brummie boys
are on the same side again.

167
00:11:18,012 --> 00:11:19,371
That'll be the bloody day.

168
00:11:19,372 --> 00:11:21,772
Well, this is the bloody day.

169
00:11:23,814 --> 00:11:26,814
London, man. There for the taking.

170
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:42,859
Tommy, I need to use the telephone.

171
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:45,500
Polly said you had one in the pub.

172
00:11:46,502 --> 00:11:49,302
All right, be quick. I have business.

173
00:11:51,623 --> 00:11:52,703
Sir.

174
00:11:52,704 --> 00:11:55,144
Polly said you own this place.

175
00:11:55,425 --> 00:11:57,424
She said you own lots
of different businesses.

176
00:11:57,425 --> 00:11:59,745
You call her Polly or Mum?

177
00:11:59,746 --> 00:12:01,986
I can't get used to calling her Mum yet.

178
00:12:05,628 --> 00:12:06,868
Who are you calling?

179
00:12:06,869 --> 00:12:09,229
My mother. I mean...

180
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,229
I know what you mean.

181
00:12:12,071 --> 00:12:13,790
And what are you going to tell her?

182
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,631
I'm going to tell her where I am.

183
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:19,472
And now you're going to tell her
you're going home.

184
00:12:21,314 --> 00:12:23,474
Polly said I could stay for a few days.

185
00:12:23,475 --> 00:12:26,515
- You want to stay?
- I've only just arrived.

186
00:12:30,237 --> 00:12:31,796
What age are you Michael?

187
00:12:31,797 --> 00:12:32,957
Seventeen.

188
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,318
Seventeen. Which means
it's not up to you, right?

189
00:12:36,319 --> 00:12:38,999
I'm 18 in a few weeks.
I make up my own mind.

190
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,080
You smoke?

191
00:12:41,081 --> 00:12:42,320
No.

192
00:12:44,242 --> 00:12:45,441
Drink?

193
00:12:51,004 --> 00:12:53,084
You're going to call your mother,

194
00:12:53,085 --> 00:12:55,725
going to tell her you're getting
the next train home.

195
00:12:55,726 --> 00:12:56,965
And when you get there,

196
00:12:56,966 --> 00:12:58,926
you're going to write a letter to Polly
saying when you're 18,

197
00:12:58,927 --> 00:13:00,487
you'll come back here
and sort things out.

198
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:02,287
I just told you.

199
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:05,568
I make up my own mind.

200
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:11,370
Do you know what we do, Michael?

201
00:13:13,372 --> 00:13:16,292
We, Shelbys.

202
00:13:17,774 --> 00:13:20,294
Yes. I think I know what you do.

203
00:13:21,695 --> 00:13:22,894
Yeah.

204
00:13:23,696 --> 00:13:25,735
You've got smart eyes.

205
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:31,337
But you're young, so you think
what we do is all right.

206
00:13:32,739 --> 00:13:34,739
It's not all right.

207
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,539
People get hurt.

208
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:43,022
Now, call your mother
and I will drive you to the station.

209
00:13:43,023 --> 00:13:44,222
No.

210
00:13:50,345 --> 00:13:52,025
In my village,

211
00:13:52,626 --> 00:13:55,226
there's this little wishing well.

212
00:13:55,787 --> 00:14:00,148
It's made of white bricks, right
in the middle of the village green.

213
00:14:00,829 --> 00:14:03,349
Everybody says how pretty it is.

214
00:14:04,830 --> 00:14:06,750
But I swear to God,

215
00:14:07,711 --> 00:14:10,231
if I spend another day in that village,

216
00:14:10,232 --> 00:14:13,272
I'm going to blow it up with dynamite.

217
00:14:13,273 --> 00:14:17,474
Probably blow my hands off with it,
but it'd be worth it.

218
00:14:17,915 --> 00:14:21,755
Just to see
all those pretty white bricks

219
00:14:21,756 --> 00:14:24,556
spread over the pretty village green.

220
00:14:37,762 --> 00:14:40,802
Yep. You're Polly's son, all right.

221
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:57,368
All right boys, let's go to work.

222
00:14:58,249 --> 00:15:00,209
Let's be having it!

223
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:03,410
Don't wait!

224
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:07,811
Keep it moving.

225
00:15:11,334 --> 00:15:12,653
Move!

226
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,979
Next lad!

227
00:15:33,861 --> 00:15:35,101
Name?

228
00:15:35,102 --> 00:15:36,301
Abbey Heath.

229
00:15:36,302 --> 00:15:37,542
Abbey Heath. Profession?

230
00:15:37,543 --> 00:15:38,742
Baker.

231
00:15:39,824 --> 00:15:42,223
Good lad. Fill it out and fuck off.

232
00:15:42,825 --> 00:15:44,304
Next lad!

233
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:48,746
Name?

234
00:15:49,187 --> 00:15:50,306
Buddy Halls.

235
00:15:50,307 --> 00:15:52,987
Buddy Halls. Right. Profession?

236
00:15:53,148 --> 00:15:54,348
Baker.

237
00:15:54,829 --> 00:15:56,989
Good lad. Fill it out and fuck off.

238
00:15:58,430 --> 00:15:59,910
Next lad!

239
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:03,431
- Name?
- Billy Kitchen.

240
00:16:03,432 --> 00:16:05,992
Billy Kitchen. Occupation?

241
00:16:05,993 --> 00:16:07,552
Head baker.

242
00:16:13,675 --> 00:16:14,915
Fill it out.

243
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:24,798
Um, Tommy Shelby, mate.

244
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:27,679
Never give power to the big man,
what did I tell you?

245
00:16:28,801 --> 00:16:31,681
Never give power to the big man.

246
00:16:32,162 --> 00:16:33,361
Next lad!

247
00:16:35,483 --> 00:16:36,683
Name?

248
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:42,044
All right, boys, you've now
all been enrolled as bakers

249
00:16:42,045 --> 00:16:44,845
in the Aerated Bread Company
of Camden Town.

250
00:16:44,846 --> 00:16:47,166
If anyone asks, that's what you do.

251
00:16:47,167 --> 00:16:48,847
You're bakers.

252
00:16:49,288 --> 00:16:52,288
The coppers in Camden Town
are on our side,

253
00:16:52,289 --> 00:16:56,289
but north or south,
you show them that piece of paper.

254
00:16:56,290 --> 00:17:00,771
Tell them you've come down from
north to find work, to break strikes.

255
00:17:01,092 --> 00:17:04,092
Tell them you're fascists,
if you have to.

256
00:17:04,453 --> 00:17:09,254
We're finding lodgings for you, but
for now you'll sleep here in the bakery.

257
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:13,255
But don't touch any of the bread,
it'll most likely explode.

258
00:17:15,497 --> 00:17:17,057
Any questions?

259
00:17:18,578 --> 00:17:19,778
Yes?

260
00:17:20,419 --> 00:17:21,978
I haven't even seen any bread.

261
00:17:58,272 --> 00:17:59,952
He'll wake up.

262
00:18:00,513 --> 00:18:05,074
Granted, he won't have any teeth left,
but he will be a wiser man for it.

263
00:18:07,515 --> 00:18:11,236
And the last thing he will remember
is your funny little joke. Won't he?

264
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:20,719
Right!

265
00:18:22,241 --> 00:18:24,040
There are fucking rules here.

266
00:18:24,041 --> 00:18:27,922
Yeah, there are fucking rules
for a fucking reason.

267
00:18:27,923 --> 00:18:31,243
Quite simply, they have to be obeyed.
All right?

268
00:18:33,124 --> 00:18:34,924
Rule number one.

269
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:41,046
The distinction between bread and rum,
yeah, is not discussed.

270
00:18:43,848 --> 00:18:45,648
Rule number two.

271
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:53,131
Anything, right,
that your superior officer

272
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:59,293
says to you or any of your other fucking
superior officers say to you, yeah?

273
00:18:59,294 --> 00:19:01,854
Not discussed!

274
00:19:05,096 --> 00:19:10,537
Rule number three, four, five, six,
seven, eight, nine, I don't care.

275
00:19:10,538 --> 00:19:14,618
For the rest of your fucking
miserable measly lives, yeah?

276
00:19:14,619 --> 00:19:17,699
Because I, like you,

277
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,420
am also a complete fucking sodomite.

278
00:19:26,663 --> 00:19:28,303
Jewish women.

279
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:32,344
You do not go anywhere near them

280
00:19:32,345 --> 00:19:36,066
because Jewish women for you
are off the fucking menu.

281
00:19:38,027 --> 00:19:39,627
I think that's fair.

282
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:03,355
All right, that's it, yeah.

283
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:06,356
Forgive me, I interrupted you.

284
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,919
Pick him up.

285
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:25,123
Get them out of here
and make this fucking work.

286
00:20:29,325 --> 00:20:31,245
Don't fucking wait!

287
00:20:31,246 --> 00:20:34,086
You're meant to be fucking soldiers!

288
00:20:34,087 --> 00:20:36,327
You're a fucking disgrace!

289
00:20:37,608 --> 00:20:38,848
Go!

290
00:21:34,388 --> 00:21:36,588
You've got a key?

291
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:38,429
I kept a spare.

292
00:21:38,430 --> 00:21:39,629
Give it to me.

293
00:21:46,713 --> 00:21:48,992
Could do with some paint?

294
00:21:48,993 --> 00:21:51,313
Yeah, when I decide.

295
00:21:58,957 --> 00:22:00,356
What is it that you want, Tommy?

296
00:22:00,357 --> 00:22:02,637
Just came by to say hello.

297
00:22:04,119 --> 00:22:07,159
Tommy Shelby never goes
anywhere for no reason.

298
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:10,000
Fine.

299
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:16,402
I've got 800 pounds left
in the Shelby property fund,

300
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:19,403
and I need someone down here
to look for suitable properties.

301
00:22:19,564 --> 00:22:20,763
To rent?

302
00:22:22,045 --> 00:22:23,244
Yes.

303
00:22:24,086 --> 00:22:25,765
To poor people.

304
00:22:25,766 --> 00:22:27,286
Ten to a room.

305
00:22:27,287 --> 00:22:29,407
No repairs, no water.

306
00:22:29,408 --> 00:22:33,448
And if they complain, you just send
Arthur and the boys round.

307
00:22:34,369 --> 00:22:37,449
You know, I give advice
down at the library.

308
00:22:37,450 --> 00:22:39,970
Families thrown on the street.

309
00:22:40,932 --> 00:22:43,211
It's men like you we're fighting.

310
00:22:46,494 --> 00:22:50,214
Well, anyway, I was just passing.
Thanks for the tea.

311
00:22:54,136 --> 00:22:55,336
Tommy.

312
00:23:00,218 --> 00:23:03,979
There are always men outside
watching the house.

313
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:06,620
Yeah. Gangsters of the worst kind.

314
00:23:06,621 --> 00:23:07,900
But they're there to keep you safe.

315
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:10,141
No there are others.
They look like coppers.

316
00:23:12,223 --> 00:23:13,942
Well, they're on your side as well.

317
00:23:14,944 --> 00:23:16,543
I don't have a fucking side.

318
00:23:16,544 --> 00:23:18,784
Ada, yes, you do.

319
00:23:20,225 --> 00:23:23,986
And, anyway, if I thought there
was no-one watching the house,

320
00:23:23,987 --> 00:23:25,826
I couldn't sleep.

321
00:23:26,588 --> 00:23:28,667
Cheerio then.

322
00:23:43,874 --> 00:23:46,554
That was great. Well done.

323
00:23:46,555 --> 00:23:48,354
Out we get then.

324
00:23:58,399 --> 00:24:00,759
This house is mine.

325
00:24:03,441 --> 00:24:05,640
I've taken on a maid.

326
00:24:05,641 --> 00:24:07,721
She's made up the big room for you.

327
00:24:08,442 --> 00:24:10,962
Come on, let's have a look.

328
00:24:19,046 --> 00:24:21,926
I thought we could spend the week here.

329
00:24:25,528 --> 00:24:28,448
You know, get to know each other again.

330
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:36,131
I've got ham. Do you like ham?

331
00:24:36,892 --> 00:24:38,452
I like ham, yes.

332
00:24:41,534 --> 00:24:43,414
- I've got a maid...
- Yes, you said.

333
00:24:46,056 --> 00:24:47,775
She's upstairs.

334
00:24:49,497 --> 00:24:50,936
She can give us some tea.

335
00:24:50,937 --> 00:24:54,017
Look, I ring this bell. Watch.

336
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,740
Yes, madam?

337
00:25:05,822 --> 00:25:07,142
I think we'd like some tea.

338
00:25:14,586 --> 00:25:15,905
You get used to it.

339
00:25:59,962 --> 00:26:02,962
The cleaning job's gone.
Vacancy's filled.

340
00:26:03,203 --> 00:26:05,082
I'm not a cleaner.

341
00:26:06,724 --> 00:26:09,684
But I have come to clean away some dirt.

342
00:26:14,407 --> 00:26:16,846
Why don't you put that away
before it goes off?

343
00:26:16,847 --> 00:26:20,088
You killed my son!

344
00:26:20,089 --> 00:26:22,889
You Peaky bastard!

345
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:25,890
You beat him

346
00:26:25,891 --> 00:26:29,811
and beat him and beat him.

347
00:26:31,573 --> 00:26:33,292
Your son was a boxer.

348
00:26:33,293 --> 00:26:34,973
No!

349
00:26:37,335 --> 00:26:38,934
He was a boy

350
00:26:40,736 --> 00:26:44,456
who got into a ring with an animal.

351
00:26:46,698 --> 00:26:48,017
Yeah, ain't that the truth.

352
00:26:48,018 --> 00:26:50,018
I've come to stop you

353
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:55,940
because the coppers
and nobody else will.

354
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:07,384
If you're going to use it,

355
00:27:07,385 --> 00:27:09,745
point that thing at my head.

356
00:27:10,666 --> 00:27:13,026
That's where the trouble is.

357
00:27:14,788 --> 00:27:17,788
Gut-shot soldiers take
half a day to die.

358
00:27:19,029 --> 00:27:20,709
I've seen 'em.

359
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:25,271
Walking around with their guts
in their arms like dirty washing.

360
00:27:27,112 --> 00:27:29,312
Hold that gun up and do it!

361
00:27:29,313 --> 00:27:31,273
Fucking do it!

362
00:27:31,914 --> 00:27:33,273
Do it!

363
00:27:47,319 --> 00:27:48,919
I'm going to finish my drink.

364
00:27:54,522 --> 00:27:56,161
You can finish it with me, if you like.

365
00:28:30,174 --> 00:28:32,774
Now, look. Look at me.

366
00:28:35,256 --> 00:28:37,096
We've got a fund.

367
00:28:38,537 --> 00:28:40,577
For you. You'll get paid weekly.

368
00:28:44,699 --> 00:28:47,419
I know it won't bring back your son.

369
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,661
I know that.

370
00:28:54,303 --> 00:28:56,262
You have other sons.

371
00:28:58,784 --> 00:29:00,184
You do.

372
00:29:00,945 --> 00:29:03,145
And we'll find them work.

373
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:05,746
And you won't have to work.

374
00:29:05,747 --> 00:29:08,347
You'll be...

375
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:20,711
Somebody has got
to stop you people.

376
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,519
Who broke the fucking mirror?

377
00:29:44,801 --> 00:29:47,240
Seven years' bad luck, that is.

378
00:29:54,444 --> 00:29:56,924
There'll be another
four boatloads tomorrow.

379
00:29:57,405 --> 00:30:00,285
What's up, Charlie? Business is good.

380
00:30:00,286 --> 00:30:03,246
This isn't business,
this is bloody work.

381
00:30:03,567 --> 00:30:08,328
Cigarettes and booze is all right,
but this manufactured stuff, it's heavy.

382
00:30:08,569 --> 00:30:10,289
I'm not even sure it's stolen.

383
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:14,410
Some of it is legally purchased.

384
00:30:14,411 --> 00:30:16,331
One day, all of it will be.

385
00:30:16,812 --> 00:30:19,092
It's like having a fucking job.

386
00:30:19,093 --> 00:30:20,852
Hey! Easy with them fan belts.

387
00:30:22,494 --> 00:30:25,894
I'll wipe that smile off your face.
I want another pound a boat.

388
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:29,735
Done.

389
00:30:32,337 --> 00:30:34,137
You don't even fight me any more.

390
00:30:35,778 --> 00:30:39,459
And it's no sport getting through
the Black Country with this truce.

391
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:42,580
They just fucking wave
at you from the bank.

392
00:30:42,581 --> 00:30:45,021
Well, just wave back?

393
00:30:46,102 --> 00:30:48,622
And all these fucking cars.

394
00:30:48,623 --> 00:30:51,343
When did you last ride a horse, Tom?

395
00:31:05,869 --> 00:31:08,549
These are just dry, Mr Campbell.

396
00:31:09,350 --> 00:31:11,070
Major Campbell.

397
00:31:11,271 --> 00:31:12,830
Beg pardon?

398
00:31:13,312 --> 00:31:15,191
It doesn't matter.

399
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:23,594
Are there any other Irishmen
lodging in this house?

400
00:31:23,595 --> 00:31:27,716
No, Mr Campbell,
I keep a respectable house.

401
00:31:27,717 --> 00:31:31,597
With your special exception,
I have no Irish here.

402
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:38,079
Well, let me know
if any come enquiring after rooms.

403
00:31:39,241 --> 00:31:42,721
Even if you turn them away,
let me know, would you?

404
00:31:42,962 --> 00:31:45,322
You're not expecting trouble, I hope.

405
00:31:45,323 --> 00:31:48,523
They only said you was
a policeman of some sort.

406
00:31:48,524 --> 00:31:51,444
No. I'm not expecting any trouble.

407
00:31:53,126 --> 00:31:58,767
Is there a cafe nearby that
serves chops? Lamb or pork?

408
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:01,928
There is a chophouse two streets away.

409
00:32:01,929 --> 00:32:04,729
But I myself serve sandwiches.

410
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:07,090
Egg and cress, or ham.

411
00:32:07,851 --> 00:32:09,730
Or anything that pleases you.

412
00:32:11,652 --> 00:32:13,892
No. No. No.

413
00:32:13,893 --> 00:32:17,413
I, I think I'll go out and get some air.

414
00:32:28,538 --> 00:32:30,858
Our scheduled meeting
is not until Sunday.

415
00:32:31,939 --> 00:32:34,419
I decided to bring it forward.

416
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,580
You just wanted to show me that
you know where I live, isn't that it?

417
00:32:37,581 --> 00:32:40,021
Am I supposed to be impressed?

418
00:32:40,862 --> 00:32:44,383
You know, Mr Churchill was impressed.

419
00:32:45,144 --> 00:32:46,743
Yes, he was.

420
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:50,265
All my demands have been met.

421
00:32:51,666 --> 00:32:53,066
Did he tell you?

422
00:32:53,507 --> 00:32:54,706
Yes.

423
00:32:55,147 --> 00:32:59,348
Yes. We had a meeting
and your letter was read aloud.

424
00:33:00,429 --> 00:33:03,509
As a matter of fact, there was quite
a lot of hilarity at the meeting.

425
00:33:03,510 --> 00:33:06,630
The gentlemen all found it quite funny.

426
00:33:06,631 --> 00:33:09,351
I see, the gentlemen found it funny.

427
00:33:09,953 --> 00:33:15,474
Tell me this, Mr Campbell, do the
gentlemen sometimes find you funny?

428
00:33:21,437 --> 00:33:24,997
We will discuss our business on Sunday,

429
00:33:24,998 --> 00:33:27,958
on the agreed day, at the allotted time,

430
00:33:27,959 --> 00:33:31,359
and at the place that has
already been determined.

431
00:33:32,441 --> 00:33:35,801
You have made your point.
Good night, Mr Shelby.

432
00:33:37,082 --> 00:33:40,963
There was another reason
I came to see you tonight.

433
00:33:40,964 --> 00:33:44,484
I just didn't want you
to be made a fool of, is all.

434
00:33:45,045 --> 00:33:49,806
The lodgings chosen for you
by the police department,

435
00:33:50,607 --> 00:33:52,607
how shall I put this?

436
00:33:53,168 --> 00:33:58,529
Well, your landlady used to run the most
famous whorehouse in Stechford.

437
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:01,410
She's only semi-retired.

438
00:34:02,331 --> 00:34:05,531
I bet the gentlemen
would find that funny?

439
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:13,614
Told to you in the spirit
of friendship and co-operation.

440
00:34:15,296 --> 00:34:17,015
See you Sunday!

441
00:34:18,177 --> 00:34:20,536
- Name?
- Digbeth Kid.

442
00:34:20,537 --> 00:34:21,817
Your real name.

443
00:34:22,818 --> 00:34:24,498
Harold Hancox.

444
00:34:26,580 --> 00:34:28,019
Profession?

445
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:30,220
Illegal bookmaker.

446
00:34:30,901 --> 00:34:32,941
You don't admit that.

447
00:34:32,942 --> 00:34:35,422
You say something like,
"Umbrella mender".

448
00:34:35,423 --> 00:34:38,743
And then we decide you're lying
and then we arrest you.

449
00:34:39,424 --> 00:34:40,664
Umbrella mender.

450
00:34:43,626 --> 00:34:46,786
You were found
in possession of betting slips,

451
00:34:46,787 --> 00:34:49,547
race cards and ticker tape.

452
00:34:49,548 --> 00:34:50,987
Any explanation?

453
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:55,029
No.

454
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:56,949
"No."

455
00:34:56,950 --> 00:34:59,590
"I have no explanation"

456
00:34:59,591 --> 00:35:03,592
"for my possession
of those items, officer."

457
00:35:04,513 --> 00:35:07,593
Take him down, will you?
I'll fill in the rest myself.

458
00:35:07,594 --> 00:35:09,154
Come on, son.

459
00:35:16,477 --> 00:35:18,517
Bloody hellfire.

460
00:35:34,523 --> 00:35:36,643
You've killed him?

461
00:35:37,324 --> 00:35:40,084
As I've explained,
he's not easy to get at.

462
00:35:40,085 --> 00:35:42,365
He's got an army round him.

463
00:35:42,846 --> 00:35:44,446
But when the time is right...

464
00:35:46,848 --> 00:35:48,647
The time is right. It's right now.

465
00:35:48,648 --> 00:35:52,609
When he's away from
his familiar territory, I will take him.

466
00:35:55,171 --> 00:35:56,530
- So what do you want?
- We heard from a guard

467
00:35:56,531 --> 00:35:59,651
at Winson Green prison that one of
their bookies has just been put inside.

468
00:35:59,892 --> 00:36:01,852
Kid called Harold Hancox.

469
00:36:01,853 --> 00:36:03,693
We could make a point.

470
00:36:03,694 --> 00:36:06,934
How many bakers is there
in Camden Town now?

471
00:36:07,775 --> 00:36:10,815
There are a lot of bakers
in Camden Town, Mr Sabini,

472
00:36:10,816 --> 00:36:14,537
but, as I have said, we don't as yet
have a definite number.

473
00:36:14,538 --> 00:36:16,577
Who won the 4:15 at Chepstow?

474
00:36:16,578 --> 00:36:18,098
Ragman.

475
00:36:18,099 --> 00:36:20,018
- Where's my dry cleaning?
- It's been collected.

476
00:36:20,019 --> 00:36:22,019
Who won the 3:50 at Kempton Park?

477
00:36:26,102 --> 00:36:28,181
- What? You don't know?
- I can find out.

478
00:36:28,743 --> 00:36:30,902
No need. I know already.

479
00:36:35,065 --> 00:36:39,745
You see, the favourites,
they're all winning.

480
00:36:39,746 --> 00:36:42,706
And the second favourites
are being done.

481
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:45,227
He's bewitching them.

482
00:36:45,228 --> 00:36:46,348
Bewitching?

483
00:36:46,349 --> 00:36:49,069
Gypsy stuff. Herbs, potions.

484
00:36:50,590 --> 00:36:55,071
And he's tipping off our big punters,
so they know who's going to win.

485
00:36:56,192 --> 00:36:58,832
Regular customers
betraying us for profit.

486
00:36:58,833 --> 00:37:01,913
You'd think they'd be loyal to us.
But profit, you see,

487
00:37:06,796 --> 00:37:09,436
comes before race, creed, family.

488
00:37:09,437 --> 00:37:10,876
Results look normal to me.

489
00:37:10,877 --> 00:37:12,717
You see shit!

490
00:37:13,758 --> 00:37:18,839
Mr Sabini, if you think they're
planning to fix Northern races,

491
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:21,200
we'll take no more bets
on anything north of Towcester.

492
00:37:21,201 --> 00:37:24,881
- I gave you a job already.
- And the job will be done.

493
00:37:24,882 --> 00:37:27,402
- But meantime...
- Meantime, fuck!

494
00:37:28,884 --> 00:37:30,923
Meantime, what do you want us
to do about the kid

495
00:37:30,924 --> 00:37:32,444
in the cage in Birmingham?

496
00:37:48,851 --> 00:37:51,891
Why would you want me
to say that out loud?

497
00:37:59,214 --> 00:38:01,574
Is there somebody listening?

498
00:38:07,977 --> 00:38:09,457
All right, I'll say it.

499
00:38:09,458 --> 00:38:12,538
We'll kill the Hancox kid
to send a message.

500
00:38:19,101 --> 00:38:23,742
Good, and then you deal
with Tommy fucking Shelby.

501
00:38:38,188 --> 00:38:39,748
You wanted to see me?

502
00:38:40,349 --> 00:38:41,588
Aye.

503
00:38:47,791 --> 00:38:49,271
Take off your clothes.

504
00:38:56,234 --> 00:38:58,194
I know what you are.

505
00:38:59,035 --> 00:39:01,875
So, take off your clothes.

506
00:39:07,798 --> 00:39:11,799
Not done in a very
gentlemanly-like way, if I may say.

507
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:14,760
Indeed not.

508
00:39:23,164 --> 00:39:24,883
So it's true. Stop.

509
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:31,246
I only wanted proof. Not satisfaction.

510
00:39:32,087 --> 00:39:34,047
Or indeed infection.

511
00:39:37,969 --> 00:39:40,089
Are you in on the joke?

512
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:42,290
What joke?

513
00:39:45,132 --> 00:39:49,012
I have unfinished business
in this filthy city.

514
00:39:49,013 --> 00:39:53,173
And when the time comes,
I will finish that business.

515
00:39:53,174 --> 00:39:57,175
And then my wrath will
come down on all of youse.

516
00:39:58,656 --> 00:40:00,496
But now,

517
00:40:01,377 --> 00:40:05,418
tell your friends in the police station

518
00:40:05,419 --> 00:40:07,819
that I know.

519
00:40:09,620 --> 00:40:12,060
And when my judgement comes,

520
00:40:13,141 --> 00:40:15,661
I'll be the one that's laughing.

521
00:40:17,223 --> 00:40:18,422
Get out.

522
00:41:12,642 --> 00:41:15,242
On the right. On the right.

523
00:41:16,404 --> 00:41:19,044
We haven't got all night. Come on!

524
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:22,485
Let's be having you, Watkins,
in there on the right.

525
00:41:22,486 --> 00:41:25,806
On the right! Come on, boys!

526
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,009
Harold Hancox?

527
00:41:41,052 --> 00:41:43,452
Tell everybody,

528
00:41:43,453 --> 00:41:47,734
this is what happens to Blinders
who come into the Green from now on.

529
00:41:47,735 --> 00:41:49,294
Orders of Sabini.

530
00:41:49,615 --> 00:41:53,096
Look, I'm not a Blinder.
I'm not a Blinder. I've been stood up.

531
00:41:53,097 --> 00:41:55,376
I'm not real! I'm not real!

532
00:41:55,377 --> 00:41:56,937
I'm not real!

533
00:42:14,944 --> 00:42:17,904
This had better be good
to interrupt my holiday.

534
00:42:17,905 --> 00:42:19,145
Where's the boy?

535
00:42:19,146 --> 00:42:20,225
In the back room.

536
00:42:20,226 --> 00:42:22,747
I only brought him because afterwards
we're going to the museum.

537
00:42:22,787 --> 00:42:25,147
- He wanted to come in and say hello...
- Shut up, John.

538
00:42:25,148 --> 00:42:27,948
There is nothing of interest
to Michael in this room.

539
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:32,069
Tommy, get on with it.

540
00:42:35,471 --> 00:42:39,552
Last night, one of our men
had his throat cut in Winson Green.

541
00:42:40,073 --> 00:42:43,073
This morning, I had a telegram
saying it was Sabini who ordered it.

542
00:42:43,074 --> 00:42:46,114
And it says here that
Thomas Shelby's next.

543
00:42:46,915 --> 00:42:49,035
If our men think we can't
look after them in prison,

544
00:42:49,036 --> 00:42:50,196
they'll not work for us.

545
00:42:50,197 --> 00:42:53,957
Sabini knows that.
So we need to get the Green sorted out.

546
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:56,358
Scudboat, you and one of the boys

547
00:42:56,359 --> 00:42:58,959
break a couple of windows,
get yourselves arrested.

548
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,919
I'll have our coppers
get you into the Green

549
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,920
and you can find
the bastards who did it.

550
00:43:03,241 --> 00:43:05,162
Instead of breaking a window,
can we pinch a car?

551
00:43:06,002 --> 00:43:09,282
What?
Everybody else is getting a bloody car.

552
00:43:09,283 --> 00:43:10,963
I'm still on a donkey.

553
00:43:10,964 --> 00:43:14,044
All right, just get yourselves
fucking arrested, it doesn't matter how.

554
00:43:14,045 --> 00:43:15,725
And before you all laugh,

555
00:43:16,006 --> 00:43:17,685
a boy is dead.

556
00:43:18,126 --> 00:43:20,006
He was just a kid.

557
00:43:20,247 --> 00:43:22,487
We'll start a fund for his family, Pol.

558
00:43:22,488 --> 00:43:23,887
Agreed.

559
00:43:24,769 --> 00:43:26,408
So is that it? Can I go now?

560
00:43:26,409 --> 00:43:28,729
Well, as company treasurer,

561
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:31,930
I need your permission
to spend 1,000 guineas.

562
00:43:32,011 --> 00:43:33,211
On what?

563
00:43:34,092 --> 00:43:35,652
On a horse.

564
00:43:37,533 --> 00:43:39,733
A thousand guineas on a horse?

565
00:43:39,734 --> 00:43:40,933
That's right.

566
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:47,376
When was this decided?

567
00:43:48,297 --> 00:43:50,417
You've been busy with Michael.

568
00:43:50,418 --> 00:43:52,017
My God.

569
00:43:52,819 --> 00:43:56,099
So, in the absence of common sense,
you boys have had an idea.

570
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:59,460
Polly, there's a thoroughbred,
quarter-Arab filly

571
00:43:59,461 --> 00:44:01,461
up for auction
at the Doncaster Bloodstock.

572
00:44:01,462 --> 00:44:03,541
What do we want with
a 1,000-guinea horse?

573
00:44:04,783 --> 00:44:07,543
When we make our move
on Sabini's racing pitches,

574
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:09,383
any men we get into
the betting enclosure

575
00:44:09,384 --> 00:44:11,424
will be lifted by Sabini's police.

576
00:44:11,425 --> 00:44:14,185
A good racehorse is a passport
to the owner's enclosure.

577
00:44:14,186 --> 00:44:16,986
We'll be in there with all the toffs.

578
00:44:18,027 --> 00:44:20,307
Coppers won't know where to look.

579
00:44:20,308 --> 00:44:22,068
Yeah, the Epsom Derby, Pol.

580
00:44:22,069 --> 00:44:23,788
We'll be drinking with the bloody king.

581
00:44:23,789 --> 00:44:24,989
The Derby?

582
00:44:25,870 --> 00:44:27,870
Did he say the Derby?

583
00:44:31,992 --> 00:44:33,752
That's right.

584
00:44:33,753 --> 00:44:36,633
For the last 10 years,
Sabini's made it his race.

585
00:44:36,634 --> 00:44:39,754
If we're going to take him down, might
as well make it there, as a symbol.

586
00:44:39,755 --> 00:44:41,915
Did you come up with this idea
in a pub by any chance?

587
00:44:41,916 --> 00:44:43,075
Pol.

588
00:44:43,076 --> 00:44:47,717
A good racehorse is an investment,
like property.

589
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:50,398
We need to diversify the portfolio.

590
00:44:50,999 --> 00:44:52,278
So when is this sale?

591
00:44:52,279 --> 00:44:53,479
Tomorrow.

592
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,800
Tommy's had a death threat, so we'll
have to go with him for protection.

593
00:44:56,801 --> 00:45:00,641
So, you're going to close up
the shop, go out on a piss-up

594
00:45:00,642 --> 00:45:03,442
and blow 1,000 guineas on a horse
that's not even whole Arab.

595
00:45:03,443 --> 00:45:06,283
Quarter-Arab is better!

596
00:45:06,845 --> 00:45:10,325
- Quarter-Arab, it means...
- Curly, shut up.

597
00:45:13,527 --> 00:45:15,887
I thought I told you to lock that door.

598
00:45:16,608 --> 00:45:19,208
He did. I used the key on the nail.

599
00:45:19,209 --> 00:45:21,609
Look, I've been listening.

600
00:45:21,610 --> 00:45:23,970
- I want to go with them.
- You see?

601
00:45:24,931 --> 00:45:27,851
I love horses. I could even help.

602
00:45:28,452 --> 00:45:29,972
Over my dead body!

603
00:45:29,973 --> 00:45:31,932
It'll be all right, Mum.

604
00:45:32,654 --> 00:45:35,614
I've been to loads of horse auctions
before with my uncle.

605
00:45:35,615 --> 00:45:39,815
They're very respectable.
People bring their butlers.

606
00:45:39,816 --> 00:45:42,016
Yeah, and their posh wives!

607
00:45:42,017 --> 00:45:43,496
And their mistresses.

608
00:45:44,618 --> 00:45:46,578
Let him come, Polly.

609
00:45:47,259 --> 00:45:50,339
We'll go there, buy an 'orse, come back.

610
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:54,020
I'll drop him back at the house
in Sutton before it gets dark.

611
00:45:54,861 --> 00:45:56,061
No.

612
00:45:58,343 --> 00:45:59,822
Fucking no!

613
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:22,790
All right, that's it. Back to work.

614
00:46:22,791 --> 00:46:24,231
Come on!

615
00:46:29,034 --> 00:46:32,394
Aunt Pol, when I was Michael's age,

616
00:46:32,395 --> 00:46:35,235
I'd killed 100 men and seen 1,000 die.

617
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:38,156
If you want to scare
that kid away forever,

618
00:46:38,157 --> 00:46:40,477
carry on how you're going.

619
00:46:40,478 --> 00:46:42,557
If you want him to stay,

620
00:46:42,558 --> 00:46:44,198
let him come.

621
00:46:56,323 --> 00:46:57,643
I can't believe it.

622
00:46:58,084 --> 00:47:00,484
AllJohn's old things fit me.

623
00:47:01,565 --> 00:47:04,205
Christ, you look like your father.

624
00:47:15,450 --> 00:47:17,850
Shrimp, ham.

625
00:47:24,693 --> 00:47:26,893
What was he like? My dad?

626
00:47:27,894 --> 00:47:29,614
How did he die?

627
00:47:32,136 --> 00:47:35,456
Well, I won't lie to you.

628
00:47:36,457 --> 00:47:39,857
He died drunk,
squeezed between a boat and a lock.

629
00:47:41,019 --> 00:47:43,299
A real river gypsy's death.

630
00:47:45,140 --> 00:47:47,660
But he could sing,

631
00:47:47,661 --> 00:47:49,501
play the piano...

632
00:47:50,262 --> 00:47:52,862
His smile would break your heart.

633
00:47:54,544 --> 00:47:57,223
You've got his same beautiful eyes.

634
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:04,546
When he was sober,
he was kind and gentle.

635
00:48:10,909 --> 00:48:12,349
His trouble was,

636
00:48:12,350 --> 00:48:14,630
he fell in with the wrong crowd
when he was a boy.

637
00:48:18,832 --> 00:48:22,873
I have told them not to blow that horn.

638
00:48:23,714 --> 00:48:26,314
This is a respectable
fucking neighbourhood!

639
00:48:48,082 --> 00:48:50,922
- She's heating up, Curly. Take a look.
- Yeah.

640
00:48:52,964 --> 00:48:55,004
Let me out for a piss.

641
00:48:57,006 --> 00:48:58,525
She made loads. Do you want one?

642
00:48:58,526 --> 00:48:59,886
What the bloody hell's that?

643
00:49:00,287 --> 00:49:03,567
Sandwiches. Ham, I think.
And we've got shrimp paste, too.

644
00:49:03,888 --> 00:49:07,088
There's tea, but we'll have to
take turns 'cause there's only one cup.

645
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:09,849
What?

646
00:49:10,210 --> 00:49:11,490
Sandwiches?

647
00:49:12,571 --> 00:49:15,331
- Yeah.
- Polly made bloody sandwiches?

648
00:49:15,332 --> 00:49:17,012
What's this?
Teddy bear's fucking picnic?

649
00:49:17,013 --> 00:49:20,493
All right. We will drink
the tea and we will eat the sandwiches

650
00:49:20,494 --> 00:49:22,573
and then we will drive on. All right?

651
00:49:22,574 --> 00:49:24,334
No crumbs, Charlie.

652
00:49:25,816 --> 00:49:28,095
- Hand them over.
- Herd them up, Arth, you fat bastard.

653
00:49:28,096 --> 00:49:30,296
- Fuck off.
- John, come on!

654
00:49:31,858 --> 00:49:34,058
All right, lads,
this is a respectable event

655
00:49:34,059 --> 00:49:35,538
and we will all behave accordingly.

656
00:49:35,539 --> 00:49:39,980
No weapons, no drinking.
John, we will stay together.

657
00:49:39,981 --> 00:49:41,660
When the horse comes up,
I will do the bidding.

658
00:49:41,661 --> 00:49:44,541
I've already registered my interest
with the auctioneer.

659
00:49:44,542 --> 00:49:45,902
So he knows to expect my bids.

660
00:49:45,903 --> 00:49:48,182
Do I get to run a hand over her, Tommy?

661
00:49:48,183 --> 00:49:50,863
We'll have a vet's report, Curly.
But keep an eye open when she walks.

662
00:49:50,864 --> 00:49:53,224
I've got a feeling, Tommy.
Something isn't right.

663
00:49:53,225 --> 00:49:56,185
It's all right, Curly. You're just
in an unfamiliar place, we all are.

664
00:49:56,186 --> 00:49:58,746
- I get feelings sometimes, Tommy.
- It's all right, Curly. It's all right.

665
00:49:58,747 --> 00:50:01,667
- Shut up, Curly.
- Do I hear 1,450?

666
00:50:01,668 --> 00:50:03,668
Do I hear 500, 500,

667
00:50:03,669 --> 00:50:07,109
1,600, 1,700? Thank you.

668
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:09,430
1,900, 2,000,

669
00:50:09,431 --> 00:50:12,231
2,100, 2,200...

670
00:50:12,232 --> 00:50:14,472
Why do people come late to these things?

671
00:50:16,553 --> 00:50:18,393
People come late
'cause they know what they want.

672
00:50:18,394 --> 00:50:20,634
It's only you who needs
to see every horse.

673
00:50:20,635 --> 00:50:22,355
Am I bid?

674
00:50:22,356 --> 00:50:24,555
2,600. I am bid!

675
00:50:25,837 --> 00:50:27,556
Sold!

676
00:50:27,557 --> 00:50:32,718
Morals of Marcus, Sedgemere stud,
by Tetrarch out of LadyJosephine.

677
00:50:32,719 --> 00:50:35,199
We'll start the bidding at 800 guineas.

678
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,960
All right, Tommy, this is her.

679
00:50:51,006 --> 00:50:53,085
Do I hear 800 guineas?

680
00:50:53,687 --> 00:50:54,886
850?

681
00:50:56,327 --> 00:50:59,528
850. Do I hear nine?

682
00:51:00,729 --> 00:51:02,289
Do I hear nine? Nine, am I bid?

683
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:03,969
Bid for this one.

684
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:05,650
The grey? Why?

685
00:51:06,371 --> 00:51:08,251
- He's beautiful.
- It's a filly.

686
00:51:08,252 --> 00:51:10,571
Micky needs some pace on the gallops.
I promised him.

687
00:51:10,572 --> 00:51:13,573
1,000. Do I hear 1,050?

688
00:51:14,334 --> 00:51:16,534
1,100?

689
00:51:16,935 --> 00:51:18,934
1,200?

690
00:51:19,616 --> 00:51:21,495
Do I hear 250?

691
00:51:22,697 --> 00:51:24,016
250.

692
00:51:24,017 --> 00:51:26,417
I'll go halves with you
from the spring fund. Go, go.

693
00:51:27,378 --> 00:51:29,658
1,300?

694
00:51:29,659 --> 00:51:31,939
1,400?

695
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:34,060
Do I hear five?

696
00:51:34,301 --> 00:51:36,140
1,500.

697
00:51:36,141 --> 00:51:37,781
1,600.

698
00:51:37,782 --> 00:51:39,582
Do I hear seven?

699
00:51:39,983 --> 00:51:41,862
1,700. Thank you.

700
00:51:41,863 --> 00:51:43,303
That's it, Tom, you have to stop.

701
00:51:43,304 --> 00:51:44,503
You don't have it in your belt.

702
00:51:44,504 --> 00:51:46,904
Yes, I do. I'm having the horse.

703
00:51:46,905 --> 00:51:49,225
She's a sweet beast, Tom.
But, stop, I tell you.

704
00:51:49,226 --> 00:51:51,266
- I feel something bad!
- Shut up, Curly!

705
00:51:51,267 --> 00:51:54,827
2,000. Do I hear 2,050?

706
00:51:56,389 --> 00:51:58,268
2,050. Am I bid?

707
00:51:59,029 --> 00:52:00,829
- 2,050...
- Enough!

708
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:02,710
Billy could use one of my geldings.

709
00:52:02,711 --> 00:52:05,831
2,000, I am bid. Do I hear 2,050?

710
00:52:06,712 --> 00:52:08,272
Last time.

711
00:52:08,313 --> 00:52:10,713
2,050?

712
00:52:11,834 --> 00:52:14,514
Sold! To Mr...

713
00:52:14,515 --> 00:52:16,595
Thomas Shelby.

714
00:52:31,761 --> 00:52:34,521
To the premises of Mr Charles Strong,

715
00:52:34,522 --> 00:52:35,601
Small Heath.

716
00:52:35,602 --> 00:52:38,282
- What kind of premises?
- Boat yard.

717
00:52:38,283 --> 00:52:39,683
Yachts?

718
00:52:40,404 --> 00:52:41,603
Canals.

719
00:52:44,646 --> 00:52:47,245
I'm curious.
What is your business, Mr Shelby?

720
00:52:47,246 --> 00:52:48,966
Import, export.

721
00:52:51,328 --> 00:52:54,528
But I also sell pegs and tell fortunes.

722
00:53:00,651 --> 00:53:02,531
You beat us to it.

723
00:53:03,052 --> 00:53:04,251
Did I?

724
00:53:04,693 --> 00:53:07,252
I was trying to nab a filly for my stud.

725
00:53:08,574 --> 00:53:11,294
- Sorry.
- Thomas Shelby from where?

726
00:53:13,256 --> 00:53:14,735
From Birmingham.

727
00:53:14,736 --> 00:53:15,815
Goodness!

728
00:53:15,816 --> 00:53:17,456
No, not much.

729
00:53:18,337 --> 00:53:21,097
May Carleton.
I breed racehorses and train them.

730
00:53:21,098 --> 00:53:22,698
What is it you do?

731
00:53:23,179 --> 00:53:25,579
I rarely answer questions, is what I do.

732
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:28,940
Tommy, come on, hurry up!
We've got to go!

733
00:53:30,422 --> 00:53:32,661
Well, before you go, if you ever
decide to put that filly out,

734
00:53:32,662 --> 00:53:35,502
- I'd be interested in having her.
- I plan to race her.

735
00:53:36,424 --> 00:53:39,584
- Do you have a trainer?
- I know people.

736
00:53:39,585 --> 00:53:40,744
- I know people, too.
- Tommy!

737
00:53:40,745 --> 00:53:42,785
We've got to get
this kid back before dark

738
00:53:42,786 --> 00:53:44,706
or Polly will have your balls!

739
00:53:44,707 --> 00:53:46,266
She will have 'em!

740
00:53:46,267 --> 00:53:48,227
We know different people, I would guess.

741
00:53:48,228 --> 00:53:50,108
My father knows Mick Hancock.

742
00:53:50,669 --> 00:53:54,549
- Trained three Ascot winners.
- So that was your father?

743
00:53:56,431 --> 00:53:57,870
Yes.

744
00:53:57,871 --> 00:54:00,271
We're joint-owners of the stud.

745
00:54:00,272 --> 00:54:03,312
He took the majority share
when my husband was killed.

746
00:54:03,313 --> 00:54:04,513
Ypres.

747
00:54:04,514 --> 00:54:08,394
Tommy!
We've got to get back to the caravans!

748
00:54:08,395 --> 00:54:10,275
The chickens are hungry!

749
00:54:14,197 --> 00:54:16,357
So will you consider me?

750
00:54:18,078 --> 00:54:19,758
I will consider you.

751
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,320
You still didn't tell me what you do.

752
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:26,520
I do bad things.

753
00:54:27,522 --> 00:54:29,761
But you already know that.

754
00:54:31,763 --> 00:54:34,123
Right, about bloody time!

755
00:54:39,086 --> 00:54:40,885
It's the fucking truth, John boy.

756
00:54:40,886 --> 00:54:44,807
Rich women these days,
all they want is working-class cock.

757
00:54:45,368 --> 00:54:48,768
Tommy, maybe she was the
something bad I had the feeling about!

758
00:54:48,769 --> 00:54:50,489
She looks all right to me, Curly!

759
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:53,810
All their men are dead, see.
Officers, all shot.

760
00:54:53,811 --> 00:54:54,890
Yeah, by us.

761
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:57,331
All I'll say is she has good contacts
in the racing world.

762
00:54:57,332 --> 00:54:58,492
Here, Michael, you drive.

763
00:54:58,493 --> 00:54:59,852
Thomas Shelby?

764
00:54:59,853 --> 00:55:01,693
Tommy!

765
00:55:02,934 --> 00:55:04,614
Tommy! Down!

766
00:55:07,776 --> 00:55:09,135
Tommy Shelby?

767
00:55:09,136 --> 00:55:10,776
How about fucking Arthur?

768
00:55:10,777 --> 00:55:12,657
Fucking good to meet you.

769
00:55:12,658 --> 00:55:14,257
Get him off him!

770
00:55:14,258 --> 00:55:15,658
Arthur! Arthur!

771
00:55:15,659 --> 00:55:18,499
Get him off him!

772
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,419
Come on. Stop it, Arthur.

773
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:22,500
Get him off.

774
00:55:22,501 --> 00:55:24,421
Arthur, that's enough.

775
00:55:24,422 --> 00:55:26,741
Arthur, come on!

776
00:55:30,024 --> 00:55:32,504
Come on, Arthur, come on.

777
00:55:32,505 --> 00:55:34,344
That's it. It's over.

778
00:55:34,825 --> 00:55:36,225
Arthur!

779
00:55:38,347 --> 00:55:40,946
Come on, shut up.

780
00:55:42,708 --> 00:55:45,068
Come on, come on.

781
00:55:49,070 --> 00:55:50,150
He's still breathing.

782
00:55:50,151 --> 00:55:52,270
Don't get blood on the kid!

783
00:55:52,271 --> 00:55:55,592
Michael, you didn't see a thing.
This didn't happen, all right?

784
00:55:55,593 --> 00:55:57,592
Give me the keys.

785
00:55:57,593 --> 00:55:59,233
Michael, give me the keys.

786
00:55:59,234 --> 00:56:01,354
I'm all right to drive.

787
00:56:03,355 --> 00:56:04,995
All right. Go on. Go on, go on!

788
00:56:04,996 --> 00:56:07,036
Tommy, he's fucking scarpered!

789
00:56:07,037 --> 00:56:10,197
- Right, let's get out of here, sharpish.
- Come on!

790
00:56:24,163 --> 00:56:26,042
So?

791
00:56:26,844 --> 00:56:28,443
How'd it go?

792
00:56:28,844 --> 00:56:30,684
Well, it was cold in the van,

793
00:56:30,685 --> 00:56:32,885
but it was super. Really.

794
00:56:33,366 --> 00:56:35,166
Let me smell your breath.

795
00:56:38,368 --> 00:56:40,247
Did they behave themselves?

796
00:56:42,289 --> 00:56:44,409
They were amazing, Mum.

797
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:47,210
They were really amazing.
