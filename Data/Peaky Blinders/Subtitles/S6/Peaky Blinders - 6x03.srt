1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:03,460
Jack Nelson's coming to London.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:06,380
There are some people in this
country who I'd like to meet.

3
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:09,560
Fascists. Not the ones in boots
and black shirts.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:11,080
The ones in tuxedos.

5
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,400
Mr Shelby, Lady Diana Mitford.

6
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:16,000
Oswald's most recent
and last ever mistress.

7
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,880
Officially he's coming to buy
liquor import licenses.

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,760
And unofficially
he's Roosevelt's envoy.

9
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:24,720
By being among the Fascists,
by being among 'em,

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,000
I can undermine them.

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,400
Still looking for trouble big enough
to kill you. If you don't want

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:30,760
to help me carry the bucket,
then I wouldn't blame you.

13
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,720
You have to carry this bucket
on your own.

14
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,280
Do we have a deal, Mr Nelson?

15
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,560
You're a brave man.

16
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,440
Every war hero I ever met,

17
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,080
they're just someone who wanted
to get themselves killed.

18
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,000
If anyone is going to kill
Tommy Shelby... It will be you.

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,200
The devil will be dead.
The future belongs to us.

20
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,040
You need to see a doctor.

21
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:52,560
We've got to keep going until
the Boston business is done.

22
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,360
Hello?

23
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:57,840
Tommy, she has a temperature of 101
and nothing is working.

24
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:58,920
Just get here now.

25
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:23,400
Out of the way! Out of the way!

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,240
No...no. Where's the doctor?
Can you get the doctor?

27
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,120
I need to speak a doctor. Mr Shelby.

28
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,760
Mr Shelby,
your daughter has consumption.

29
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,800
Consumption
is a very infectious disease.

30
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:35,160
There are procedures
that must be followed.

31
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,080
Please, hand over the child. OK.
Lizzie?

32
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:39,480
It's going to be all right.

33
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,200
Right, you take her. You be gentle.

34
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,760
Look after her.

35
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:46,560
That's my daughter, you hear me?

36
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,120
I need to be with her.

37
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,320
I need to be with my daughter!

38
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,560
Tom.

39
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,160
OK. Come on. They are X-raying Ruby,
they have to X-ray us

40
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,720
because we might have it as well.
Fuck us, Lizzie.

41
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,000
Fuck us! Fuck you and me!

42
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,720
Who brought this on?

43
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,880
We brought on this curse.

44
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:07,880
Stop, Tommy.

45
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:09,280
Fucking stop!

46
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,280
They wouldn't let me pass.

47
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,600
They wouldn't let me pass.

48
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,600
They did it on purpose,
to punish me.

49
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,960
Tommy, stop it, please.

50
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,920
All right.

51
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,600
All right.

52
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:33,560
My husband is very sorry.

53
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,040
OK.

54
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,840
My husband is very sorry
and he is calm now.

55
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:45,880
He is recovering from addiction.
Sometimes...

56
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,000
Sometimes...

57
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,720
..he's a horse in a crate,
kicking the crate.

58
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:56,960
It's just the crate I'm kicking.

59
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,560
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,080
Lizzie. Yeah?

61
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,760
Tell me what I have to do.

62
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,880
This way, sir. Sorry.

63
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,200
Thank you.

64
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:23,480
Mr Shelby, you will need to
keep still for a moment.

65
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,720
To see what's inside.

66
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,080
Wait till you see.

67
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,480
God.

68
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,560
God knows what's inside.

69
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,160
God help her.

70
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,320
She has a tubercular infection
in her left lung.

71
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,320
They've caught it quite early.

72
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,200
They'll do more tests.

73
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,640
They do this thing,
pulmonary something,

74
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:48,440
where they collapse the lung,
let it rest.

75
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:50,120
Sometimes the lung cures itself.

76
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,480
And if that doesn't work,
they use gold.

77
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,600
What?

78
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:01,040
Gold? Gold salts.

79
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:03,320
The doctor said he explained
their methods to you

80
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:06,120
when you cut the ribbon to open
the institution.

81
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,400
I can't remember,
I wasn't listening.

82
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,360
Yeah, well.

83
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,360
Gold salts.

84
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,640
Salt with 37% gold.

85
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,600
They say it helps, but it will
make her more sick at first.

86
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,080
Did they say what...?

87
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,440
Did they say what the chances are?

88
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,920
No. They don't say. Hm.

89
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,200
But she's small.

90
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,840
And with TB that's not good
because the disease is big and fast.

91
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,280
I'm so sorry, my darling.

92
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,800
But I will deal with it.

93
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,840
I will make it go away.

94
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,600
I will strike a bargain.

95
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,160
You should be wearing a mask.

96
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,240
I am.

97
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:26,080
You can try gold,
I will try something else.

98
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,760
Mayfair 244.

99
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,320
Ada. Listen to me.

100
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,120
I need you to be me in London.

101
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,880
No, it's important.

102
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,040
I know you want nothing to do
with my business,

103
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,520
but Ruby is very sick.

104
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,360
I need five days of your time.

105
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,480
So she dresses well.

106
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:14,040
Go to the door and take her coat.
Yes, ma'am.

107
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,440
Uh...and make a note of the label.

108
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,960
Of course, ma'am.

109
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,760
Oh, Thomas, where the devil are you?

110
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:08,000
Mrs Ada Thorne, ma'am.

111
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,520
I thought you were all called
Shelby. Ah, I'm a widow.

112
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:16,240
My husband didn't have the
good grace to die. He lingers yet.

113
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,400
Your husband is a member of
the Guinness family, I believe.

114
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,640
They do a lot of good work on behalf
of the poor.

115
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,320
The poor who are only poor because

116
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:26,480
they spent so much of their income
on Guinness. Please.

117
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:30,320
I think the causes of poverty are
a little more complex than that.

118
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,560
Yes. I believe it is to do
with genetics.

119
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:35,560
Huh. Beautiful vase.

120
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:38,480
My grandfather stole it from
a brothel in Cairo.

121
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,560
Egyptian. The 18th Dynasty, I think.

122
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:44,040
How do you know so much about
Egyptian vases?

123
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,040
I collect antiques. Hm.

124
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,320
A tribe of Gypsies settles on
a clearing in a factory town.

125
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:54,080
Children, of course,
ensue in their hundreds,

126
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,160
but one of them becomes
a gangster and a politician,

127
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,880
the other a collector of antiques.

128
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,600
It is quite extraordinary.

129
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,200
A result of genetics, I think.

130
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,000
My dear, you researched me
and I researched you.

131
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,760
If this was 1919, you would have
come through my front door carrying

132
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,440
a revolver and a Molotov cocktail

133
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:13,440
and would happily have blown off
my head.

134
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,280
Hm, isn't it wonderful how time
changes everything?

135
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,160
Where is the American?
He'll be here later.

136
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,000
Where is Mosley? He heard Thomas
wasn't coming so he decided to sulk.

137
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,160
You know how men are.
Where is Thomas?

138
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,080
His daughter is sick.

139
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,360
Does he not employ a Governess?

140
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,480
It's a class thing, a genetic thing.

141
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:34,000
He puts his daughter's welfare
before business.

142
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,080
Even the business of changing
the world.

143
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:38,080
I thought today was purely social.

144
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,240
Now that it's just you,
I suppose it will be.

145
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,960
You should know your brother
has altered my life.

146
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:53,720
The men here just bounce up and down
in their saddles in a rising trot,

147
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,440
never even galloping.

148
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:58,520
Thomas is the man on the horse
on the vase.

149
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,520
That's why I put it out for you
to look at.

150
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,480
According to recent interpretations,

151
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,760
the black rider on 18th Dynasty
vases is meant to signify

152
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,360
approaching death.

153
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,640
So, yes, I suppose it resembles
Thomas.

154
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,760
Tell me, why is he so emotionally
mutilated?

155
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,240
Oh. Because he is a character in
a novel, of course.

156
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:25,320
One of those novels ladies like you
like to read. All about wild men.

157
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:27,840
Oh, I don't read novels,

158
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,080
I read only pornography
and politics.

159
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,400
In the absence of the men, shouldn't
we ladies be engaging in small talk?

160
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,120
Very well. Small talk.

161
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,480
You know I like to fuck women
as well as men.

162
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,000
Mm, Tommy was right.

163
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,560
He says that everything is a circle.

164
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,120
A lady in Eaton Square, as coarse
and honest as an Aston whore.

165
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,080
I just realised I haven't even
offered you a drink.

166
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:20,400
Ada. Before the dreary business
of changing the world begins,

167
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,880
I want you to know something.

168
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,480
When the time comes for
the great cleansing,

169
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,800
I myself will personally argue
the case that

170
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:32,480
the Jews must be dealt with, but
that the Gypsies should be spared.

171
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,880
Huh.

172
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,560
Let's drink whisky
and wait for the American.

173
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,600
Huh.

174
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,160
Who the fuck are you?

175
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:38,880
I am the owner of this Colt pistol
and the bullets within it.

176
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,360
And I am in a hurry.

177
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,000
I followed the patrin signs
for the Lee family.

178
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:48,040
I'm looking for Esme Shelby-Lee.

179
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:49,480
Never heard of her.

180
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,920
Esme's husband
was a fucking dirty Didicoi.

181
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,960
He was a Peaky Blinder. Yeah?

182
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,440
Well, I'm the elder and more
terrible.

183
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,120
And as I said, I'm in a hurry.

184
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,440
Where is she?

185
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,160
Put your gun away, Thomas,
there's children around.

186
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,040
You only found me
cos I let you find me.

187
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:47,240
I heard you were looking,
and I'm curious.

188
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:55,960
If any of these men is your man,
please tell him I want no trouble.

189
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,160
I don't have a man.

190
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:59,960
What use is a man?

191
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,480
A horse pulls the wagon.
A dog keeps me safe.

192
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,080
A cat keeps me warm at night.

193
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:13,600
And if anybody's going to give you
trouble, Tommy Shelby. It'll be me.

194
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,000
What do you want?

195
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:18,520
Tell them to leave.

196
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:21,960
What, you think I'm in charge here?

197
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,360
Oh, I'm sure of it, Esme.

198
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,880
Didicoi's too grand to put his arse
on the grass these days?

199
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:03,880
I have a daughter, Esme.

200
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:05,760
Her name is Ruby.

201
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,720
She's fallen ill suddenly.

202
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,280
She's very sick.

203
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:16,760
And I can tell by saying her name
and looking in your eyes

204
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,040
that I have wasted petrol,
time and hope.

205
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,760
Wasted petrol on what?

206
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,400
Ah...

207
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,880
Tommy Shelby, OBE MP.

208
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,600
Running round the mountains in

209
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,640
pursuit of a Gypsy curse,
is that it?

210
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,800
I thought you had Polly deal with
the spirits. Polly is dead.

211
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,600
Bullet or a blade?

212
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:46,480
Still speaks to me in my dreams.

213
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,640
It was her who told me
to come find you.

214
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,960
Polly.

215
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,080
That name like the ringing of
the school bell.

216
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,480
Come and do as you're told.

217
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,240
Oh, fuck!

218
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,440
I am so glad I'm not in your camp
any more.

219
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,320
Made of bricks and bars.

220
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,160
My daughter is dying, Esme.

221
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,480
Some people go to France.
To Lourdes.

222
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,200
I hear they sell trinkets.

223
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,720
I need more than fucking trinkets.

224
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,080
I can tell from your reaction
this is not your doing.

225
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,680
I'm sorry for troubling you.

226
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,520
The butler says our American friend
is parking the car.

227
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,360
He also says, in answer to
your inquiry, Diana,

228
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,560
that the coat our exotic friend
is wearing is made by Chanel.

229
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,160
That's a very expensive label.
Yes, it is.

230
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,400
But the perfume
I can smell on you is very cheap.

231
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:15,040
I am deeply, deeply annoyed
that Thomas isn't here.

232
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,760
It is a family emergency,
apparently.

233
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,920
We only have Ada. The sister.

234
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,080
Well, would the sister like
some more Champagne?

235
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:27,000
Oh, the sister is allowed to speak?

236
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,040
She thinks this lunch is
purely social.

237
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:33,520
The sister is here because there's
sickness in the family.

238
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,120
Thomas wanted someone from
the Shelby organisation

239
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,600
to introduce Mr Nelson to you

240
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,320
and to offer all three of you
an invitation.

241
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,000
Ooh. What invitation?

242
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,760
The invitation can wait.

243
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,840
And please remember, in this moment,
in this room,

244
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,240
it is the Shelby family
that holds the power,

245
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:54,240
because we have the information
and the incentives

246
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:57,640
that will make Mr Nelson do
what you require him to do.

247
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,320
So when I speak, please keep
your fucking mouths closed,

248
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:03,760
because, although I'm reluctant,
I am actually quite good at this.

249
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,800
And yes, I will have Champagne.

250
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,960
Ah. Take care of this.

251
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,680
OK, so before these dull
introductions begin,

252
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:20,760
I just have to tell you something
that my niece Gina just told me.

253
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,720
Oh, Jack. She said the Shelby family
are all witches

254
00:20:23,720 --> 00:20:25,880
and sorcerers who speak freely
with the dead.

255
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,400
So who here's a Shelby?

256
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,400
Is it true?

257
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,760
Gina. Hello, Ada.

258
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,760
Michael sends his regards.

259
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,520
You're the sister.

260
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:45,480
Yes, it seems I am indeed
the sister.

261
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,760
I did some research.

262
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,240
You were a Communist once,
but diamonds and lipstick now.

263
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,760
Actually, I'm a Socialist.

264
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,600
She is Mr Shelby's
political adviser.

265
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,680
And you, you're the future
Prime Minister of Great Britain

266
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:00,720
and its dominions. Indeed I am.

267
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,320
And you, Lady Diana Mitford,

268
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:06,360
the talk of London with
her amphetamines and emeralds.

269
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,400
It is her sharp mind that
I am in love with.

270
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,280
Men bore me.
Ada, do you have a man?

271
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:17,400
My husband died,
but of course we speak often.

272
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,840
Between this sparkling conversation,
could I get a drink of some kind?

273
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,680
So this little kid Gina,
she runs out,

274
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:29,560
she marries a gangster,

275
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,400
and now here we all are.

276
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,640
Oh, Jack, please, you are so blunt.

277
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,400
Yes, it's wonderful.

278
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,880
A man who is not careful
with his words.

279
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:39,440
I'm not careful.

280
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,200
Just say it first then clear up
the broken glass with my bare hands.

281
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,040
There you are.

282
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:47,000
I don't seem to have
a drink either.

283
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:51,480
Well, I have Scotch or Irish.

284
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,920
Thomas drinks Irish.

285
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:55,240
Where the hell is he? Irish.

286
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:57,280
He's been unavoidably detained.

287
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,160
Nothing is unavoidable.
His daughter is unwell.

288
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,760
He doesn't have a wife?

289
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:09,480
You know, I did some research
on you too, Mr Nelson.

290
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,200
Ada here is the smart one
of the family.

291
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,520
I learnt that when you were young
you lost a brother

292
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,240
and a sister to consumption?

293
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,440
No ice?

294
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,480
Well, that same awful illness
has entered our family.

295
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,320
And, you see, Thomas has very little
faith in current medical practice

296
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,280
regarding tuberculosis.
Man, he has that right.

297
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,480
He's gone off in search
of alternative approaches

298
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,920
to curing the disease.

299
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,880
Experimental work that he hopes
will save the life of his daughter.

300
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,840
In his shoes I would do
the same thing.

301
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,840
Your brother intrigues me.

302
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,640
Yes, he often has that effect
on people.

303
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:57,120
Yes, and my future husband has that
effect on 20 million people in this

304
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,560
country who attend his rallies
and listen to his broadcasts.

305
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:05,600
It's amazing what English
upper class women can do

306
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,680
with just skin, bone and arrogance.

307
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,840
My brother sends his apologies
for not being here

308
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:16,520
and would like to invite all of you
to his home for a meeting.

309
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,400
A meeting where the real business
will be done.

310
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:23,080
And where you can meet like minds
from Ireland who would also like

311
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,000
to discuss the future of Europe.

312
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,640
But as you say, this lunch is
purely social.

313
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:32,920
And looking at my glass, I see
I still don't have Champagne.

314
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,440
Michael told me the sister
had gone straight.

315
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,920
Yes, but her brother is the sun,
and the rest just orbit around him.

316
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:46,040
Gina tells me lots of things,
but I want to hear it from you, Ada.

317
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,800
What exactly does
the Shelby Company Limited do?

318
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,560
Fuck!

319
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,800
You used to have eyes in
the back of your head.

320
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,960
How can you change so much
and not change at all?

321
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,320
I have other lines of inquiry,
give me the spark plug. Gimme the...

322
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,280
Gimme the fucking spark plug.

323
00:24:46,280 --> 00:24:48,520
Give you the spark, give you hope?
Is that what you want?

324
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,960
Something you should see.

325
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:02,360
Someone dead,
someone grieving.

326
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,480
A lot of hate against you.

327
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,600
You were wise to come to me, Thomas.

328
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:15,800
Open up the bonnet, would you?

329
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,000
What hate?

330
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:21,120
What hate, what grieving?

331
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:47,680
I can't explain where it is
you have to go.

332
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:48,920
So I'll take you there.

333
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,600
I hope the suspension is good.

334
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:55,000
We're going to a wild old place.

335
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,520
Mrs Thorne, Mr Shelby isn't here.

336
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,560
I know. I am.

337
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,480
Do you know where he's gone?

338
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,760
He's gone up a mountain
looking for a miracle.

339
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,960
No-one is allowed to go in
if he's not here.

340
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,520
Just bring me the keys.

341
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,080
All of the keys.

342
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:50,720
Do you want tea, Mrs Thorne?

343
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,200
Whisky.

344
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,960
Mr Shelby doesn't allow whisky
in the building any more.

345
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,760
Then have someone
go and fetch some.

346
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:03,400
Until Mr Shelby comes down off
his mountain, I'm in charge.

347
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,960
Yes, Mrs Thorne.

348
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,680
Fuck.

349
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:07,520
Mickey, I've got to go.
The boss's sister is here.

350
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:11,440
For the next five days, I'm not
the boss's sister, I'm the boss.

351
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:15,440
Where is Arthur?
We locked him in the cash safe.

352
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:19,160
When he gets the yamps really bad
he tells us to lock him in the safe,

353
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:21,800
to stop him from slipping down
to China Town.

354
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,080
What are the yamps?

355
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:28,360
When you lose your head.
When you can't control yourself.

356
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,000
Young people say it.

357
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,040
And Arthur gets the yamps a lot?

358
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:38,720
A lot is twice a day.
Arthur gets them three times a day.

359
00:28:39,840 --> 00:28:42,080
It smells in here.

360
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,760
Arthur sleeps on the floor.
We lock him in at night.

361
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,320
On your feet.

362
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,520
Sit down.

363
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,000
Nice perfume.

364
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,440
Tommy likes you, Isiah.

365
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,760
I believe I'm suited to this life.

366
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,720
I'm not so sure about you.

367
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,240
I was given to understand that you
are no longer part of the company.

368
00:29:17,240 --> 00:29:19,240
Hm.

369
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,320
You speak well.

370
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,760
I was going to be an accountant

371
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:26,680
but everybody said I would be wasted
counting money,

372
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,320
instead of stealing it.

373
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,960
What's the name of that perfume?

374
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,720
I've got a girlfriend
with a birthday.

375
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:38,960
I want you to go to Liverpool.

376
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,360
Then I will go to Liverpool.

377
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,720
We have opium in storage at
the Salthouse docks.

378
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,720
Word got out among the dock workers.

379
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:49,960
They started stealing cupfuls,
now it's by the bucket.

380
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,720
By the bucket? The audacity of it.

381
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:58,760
The sale of the stolen opium
is being organised

382
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:02,520
by a union convenor
called Haydn Stagg.

383
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,200
In the envelope you'll find details
of where to find him

384
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,080
and what to do to him when you do.

385
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:13,440
Is there a black star in
the envelope?

386
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,000
I decided not.

387
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,040
You decided?

388
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:22,560
The name of the perfume is
know your fucking place, soldier.

389
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:27,480
I decided he'll just take a beating.

390
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:31,720
And also, that you're
going to take Arthur with you.

391
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:34,200
Arthur, ten days clean,

392
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:36,960
and we're going to take him into
a warehouse full of fucking opium?

393
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,120
It can be your job
to look after him.

394
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,840
Why take him at all?

395
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:43,400
It's his reputation you're taking.

396
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,800
The beating can be conducted
in a civilised way.

397
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:50,160
No-one would dare fuck with
Arthur Shelby.

398
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,280
But they would fuck with me?

399
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:54,920
Yes. He is Arthur Shelby.

400
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,680
You're Isiah...who?

401
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:06,160
I'm just Isiah,
who is keen to learn, Ada.

402
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,880
Keep him clean.

403
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:13,480
Deal with Haydn Stagg,
bring Arthur back in one piece.

404
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,360
And in return, I won't tell Tommy
that you're laying private bets

405
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,640
on races that we've fixed.

406
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,960
Just trying to make
a few extra pennies,

407
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:26,880
buy that birthday present
for my girlfriend.

408
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,280
Mm, lucky girl.

409
00:32:16,560 --> 00:32:19,200
Lock the door, Lizzie.
There are people around here

410
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,880
who start drinking
this early in the morning.

411
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,160
No.

412
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,320
I need to stay myself
and be strong.

413
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,560
Now, come on, not with me.
You can let it go with me.

414
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:41,960
I can't cry, Ada.
If I start, I'll fall apart.

415
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,800
I need to stay strong for Ruby.

416
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,680
Tommy says it's just in one lung.

417
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:52,480
No. They now think it's in both.

418
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,840
It's moving quickly.

419
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:00,520
They collapsed the left lung
but it made no difference.

420
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,840
They're starting her
on the gold salts tomorrow.

421
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,680
You know somebody who died
on the gold treatment, yes?

422
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,960
Half the people I tell
look like you just did

423
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,440
because they know someome
who died on the gold treatment.

424
00:33:17,800 --> 00:33:19,400
The person I knew was old.

425
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:22,320
Old and young, the same.

426
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,160
Have you given up, Lizzie?

427
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,560
No.

428
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:36,160
I'm being strong.

429
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,400
At her bedside, on my own.

430
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,800
While Tommy is up in the mountains
to be among the gypsies.

431
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:48,800
In truth it's a blessing
he's not around at the hospital,

432
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,280
because all he wants to do
is fight people

433
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,160
and blame himself,

434
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:55,000
and I've never felt
so ashamed of him,

435
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,360
Christ, because right now
I need a normal man.

436
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,920
And it's me sitting there,
taking away the bloody rags

437
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,640
and watching her disappear.

438
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:31,200
Do you know when he's back, Ada?

439
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,400
He gave me instructions,
not information.

440
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,760
Can you get a message to him?

441
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:42,160
He'll be out of reach.

442
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:47,280
Ada, I thought you might
know things.

443
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,360
I've been away from all this.

444
00:34:50,640 --> 00:34:52,320
You're still Gypsy.

445
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:55,240
Yeah, well. The mystery leaves you.

446
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,800
What mystery? Lizzie, is there
anything practical that I can do?

447
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,760
Before he left, he was looking
for a number for Esme.

448
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:12,240
What's Esme got to do with this?

449
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,640
I thought you might know.

450
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:16,840
Esme's a Lee.

451
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,560
What does that mean?

452
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:22,640
The Lees and the Barwells,
they're wild tribes.

453
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:26,160
Where do they live?

454
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,760
They're gypsies,
they live where they like.

455
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,240
Fuck. Fuck, Ada.

456
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,640
Tribes in the mountains.

457
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:42,680
It's 1934, and the doctors
know what it is,

458
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:44,400
they know what causes it,

459
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,880
but oh, no, my husband,
he knows better.

460
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:49,840
Not a normal man, your brother.

461
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,560
He's up in the mountains
with fucking horse thieves

462
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,640
and sorcerers while I'm here
on my own.

463
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:58,960
Not a normal man.

464
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,720
It's OK, Arthur.
I'll look after you.

465
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:54,000
Yeah.

466
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,480
And Ada said it would be OK
if I recruited my cousins.

467
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,000
Off the streets of Alum Rock,
and looking for the big time.

468
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,560
What do you say, Arthur?

469
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:23,720
I say big-time boys
don't ask for permission.

470
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,880
I think he means you're in.

471
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:29,360
Let's go.

472
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:52,360
Can you still ride bareback?

473
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,080
We're a long way from anywhere,
Esme.

474
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:02,080
If I find out
you've been wasting my time,

475
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:04,640
I'll use that rope
to fucking hang you.

476
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,880
Right, hold up,
Hold on, hold on.

477
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,760
Listen, you know what
you've got to do, right?

478
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,680
You've got your orders,
I'm depending on you.

479
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,240
Do you hear me?

480
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,000
Let me tell you something.

481
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,360
Any man, any fucking man
who looked like this before...

482
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,320
..they're Peaky Blinder.

483
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:45,920
Peaky Blinder
still looks like this.

484
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,680
After.

485
00:39:52,840 --> 00:39:54,960
# Ar! Ar! Ar! Ar! Ar!

486
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,200
# Said the puppy to the snake

487
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,840
# I've got a real big mirror
of a smile

488
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,160
# And I hold it to the fakes

489
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:10,600
# Hard boot slammed to the ground

490
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:12,720
# So I see what shakes. #

491
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:20,480
We are here to meet
a gentleman called Haydn Stagg.

492
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:23,560
A gentleman?

493
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:26,840
Mr Stagg?

494
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,360
That scoundrel.

495
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,600
Never there when you need him.

496
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:39,800
Who needs him?

497
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,160
We do.

498
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:43,960
Where is he?

499
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,960
Last I saw he was up to his balls
in a lady called Maria.

500
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:56,760
We have no time for tradition

501
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,560
or the rules of the sporting life.

502
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,440
Because, among the Peaky Blinders,

503
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:06,040
any man who comes home from
a mission with all his bullets,

504
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:07,760
he pays a fine.

505
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:11,560
My name's Haydn Stagg.

506
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:14,520
I hear there's some men here
from Birmingham looking for me.

507
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,680
I was in the banana warehouse
playing football with the boys.

508
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,400
But I'm guessing you gentlemen
aren't here to kick footballs.

509
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:33,600
No.

510
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,480
We're here about
other business.

511
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:40,000
We like to call it
Black Star business.

512
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,480
The Black Star a pub, is it?

513
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,680
Yeah. The Black Star's a pub.

514
00:41:48,040 --> 00:41:50,960
The last pub
you ever fucking drink in.

515
00:41:50,960 --> 00:41:53,600
The Peaky Blinders
take you to the Black Star

516
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:55,440
and all your troubles are done.

517
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,160
But the pub you drink in,
Mr Stagg,

518
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:04,240
is called The Dolphin, right?

519
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,200
Every night you're in there.

520
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,240
Not to drink -

521
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,480
you're there divvying up
the days takings, in't ya?

522
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,960
And there's a woman there.

523
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:25,000
She sings out, "Opium for sale!"

524
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,280
Sit down, boys.

525
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,520
The rules say the King puts his head
on the block and the game is up.

526
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:42,520
You're stealing from
the Shelby Company Limited.

527
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,280
You're stealing from
the Peaky Blinders, man.

528
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,800
Therefore...

529
00:42:54,360 --> 00:42:55,840
..punishment...

530
00:42:56,840 --> 00:43:00,040
..is a visit
to the Black Star pub.

531
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:12,520
But, out of kindness of my heart,

532
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:16,280
your sentence has been commuted.

533
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:19,880
Praise the fucking Lord!

534
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,880
And our lovely Ada, eh?

535
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,440
Instead...

536
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:32,440
..instead, Mr Haydn Stagg,
it's just a beating for you.

537
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,840
Well, before I take this beating...

538
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:41,000
Arthur Shelby, is it, yeah?

539
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:47,560
Well, comrade, beneath your sleeves
lies the truth.

540
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:49,920
The marks on your arm.

541
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,240
Yeah.

542
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:54,280
Stories about you
come up the canal.

543
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:58,880
Where once you walked fine alone,
now you need a stick.

544
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,840
Let's just fucking do it, Arthur.

545
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,000
For me it was the morphine
they gave us in France.

546
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,080
I got a taste for it, Arthur.

547
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:13,400
It was 1924 before I realised
the fucking war was over.

548
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,760
There's a warehouse full of it is
just across the yard, there,

549
00:44:18,760 --> 00:44:21,160
where the boys play football.

550
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,920
And they steal it
and roll around laughing,

551
00:44:23,920 --> 00:44:25,760
and it floats in the air.

552
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,560
But I'm strong, comrade.

553
00:44:30,560 --> 00:44:33,600
Arthur. Let's just fucking do it.

554
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:38,640
Liar. It's me that's due a beating.

555
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:42,160
But it's me who feels sorry
for you, Mr Shelby.

556
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,760
Because you take your beating
every hour of every day.

557
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:50,680
Your own blood betrays you,
because it demands dilution.

558
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:55,120
And sometimes you want to cut
a doorway in your arm

559
00:44:55,120 --> 00:44:58,320
so your blood can escape
and leave you in blessed peace.

560
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,400
Yeah.

561
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,920
Fuck you, man.

562
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,800
I was once where you are now,
Arthur.

563
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:11,760
If you're going to do it, do it.

564
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,200
But look at me
as the man you can be.

565
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:20,000
You've tried Jesus, yeah?

566
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:22,920
Yeah, he looked you up and down
and he shook his head.

567
00:45:22,920 --> 00:45:24,280
Your loved ones...

568
00:45:26,080 --> 00:45:28,000
..your wife, your kids.

569
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,960
Jesus and your wife
and your kids can't help you.

570
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,080
Only you, Arthur Shelby.

571
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:44,520
Only you.

572
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,560
Don't count the days.

573
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:49,360
Futile.

574
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:52,040
You get to 100, then you wake up
and it's fucking one again.

575
00:45:56,080 --> 00:45:57,720
Don't build mountains.

576
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,120
Walk like it's a flat plain.

577
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:06,320
Easy step by easy step.

578
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,280
Arthur, just give me the fucking
word and I'll fucking do it.

579
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,080
Use your stick, Arthur.
Give him the order.

580
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:26,960
Arthur, I'm not going to ask you
fucking twice.

581
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:28,880
Isiah, leave him alone.

582
00:46:28,880 --> 00:46:30,360
No...No fucking way.

583
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:33,120
I said you can stand down.

584
00:46:50,120 --> 00:46:51,960
Let's go, come on.

585
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:55,240
Come on, all of ya. Go on. Go on.

586
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:34,320
Gypsy graveyard?

587
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:35,640
You can still read the signs.

588
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,800
No horse will go beyond here.
We'll have to walk.

589
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:50,040
Just tell me whose grave it is.

590
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:51,880
You'll see.

591
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,000
Who knows what you'll see?

592
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:58,280
Do you ever go to John's grave?

593
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:00,000
Things are really bad.

594
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,120
When what's really bad?

595
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,960
I've done bad things, Esme.

596
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:07,880
And you think now you're being
punished for them?

597
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,720
I would like to make amends.

598
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,600
You want to lift every curse
anyone has ever put on you?

599
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:14,480
That's a lot of lifting.

600
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:16,240
My own curse is in there somewhere.

601
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,880
I should have done more
to protect John.

602
00:48:17,880 --> 00:48:19,080
You think in this holy place

603
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:21,040
the spirits are listening to you
being kind?

604
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:24,640
Believe it or not, Esme,
I am discovering kindness.

605
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,440
I'm learning it from my children.

606
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:30,080
Do you ever think
you've lost your mind, Thomas?

607
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,480
Lost it long ago.

608
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:33,920
I only use the crate it came in.

609
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,920
I know why you're here.

610
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:37,400
I'm in a hurry, Esme.

611
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,880
You think you can make a deal
even with death?

612
00:48:39,880 --> 00:48:42,320
Well, soon you'll be in
the right place to do it.

613
00:48:42,320 --> 00:48:45,200
The village disappeared.
The church fell down.

614
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,880
Only us still use the graveyard.

615
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,120
Do you recall a sapphire?

616
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:55,280
You gave a sapphire to
a woman called Bethany Barwell.

617
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:56,800
Ten years ago.

618
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,920
She took the stone back
to her camp.

619
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,840
I warned her about it,
but she took it anyway.

620
00:49:01,840 --> 00:49:04,280
She gave the sapphire to her sister.

621
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,080
Evadne Barwell.

622
00:49:06,080 --> 00:49:08,920
Evadne put the stone around
the neck of her daughter.

623
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:09,960
A little girl.

624
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:14,520
Straight away, the little girl
began to cough.

625
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:18,680
She died that night.

626
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,000
Seven years old.

627
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,440
I heard they threw the sapphire
in the river.

628
00:49:30,680 --> 00:49:32,400
No-one's ever gone to look
for it.

629
00:49:34,680 --> 00:49:37,440
I'm guessing it'll be the girl's
mother who laid the curse.

630
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,280
Only women can lay curses.

631
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:45,320
Perhaps she waited until
your little girl was seven,

632
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:47,120
so you'd know how it feels.

633
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:00,040
Do you have whisky? No.

634
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,680
Tommy.

635
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,680
Perhaps the treatment will work
and your daughter will live.

636
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,200
It's science.

637
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:29,120
Science is winning everything
these days.

638
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:31,040
Even against the angels.

639
00:50:35,840 --> 00:50:38,640
I can leave you, if you want.

640
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:41,440
Your horse will know his way back.

641
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:44,640
But I think there should be some
reward for what I have shown you.

642
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:48,360
Some consideration.
You can afford it, Mr Shelby OBE.

643
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,880
I will find her.

644
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:54,200
I will find this fucking
Evadne Barwell,

645
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:55,560
I will fucking find her,

646
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:57,720
and I will give her money
to take back this curse.

647
00:50:57,720 --> 00:50:59,960
You only found me
because I wanted to be found.

648
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:02,080
And the Barwells roam from
the border to the sea.

649
00:51:02,080 --> 00:51:04,200
I will give her £10,000.
More. Anything.

650
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:05,600
You will put out word, Esme.

651
00:51:05,600 --> 00:51:08,320
You will put out word. I will
put out word, and I will find her.

652
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:10,960
And instead of this poor
wooden cross... Tommy!

653
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:14,000
..I will build a monument
to this little girl.

654
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:15,400
Her mother can decide how big.

655
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:18,080
It can be as big as fucking
Nelson's Column.

656
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:20,440
That and £10,000.

657
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:23,760
I will buy her off.
I will start looking today.

658
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,120
Ruby will be well.

659
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:28,280
She will be well!

660
00:51:28,280 --> 00:51:31,440
And I will undo the many wrongs
that I have done.

661
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,960
Now that I'm without whisky
I can hear the spirits clearly,

662
00:51:33,960 --> 00:51:36,440
and they're saying Ruby
will be well, if I make amends.

663
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:37,800
That is the conversation.

664
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,720
If you want my help, I will help
you, Thomas, if you also pay me.

665
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:43,120
Pay me and I will help you
to find her.

666
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,240
I will pay you.
But I don't want money.

667
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,840
I don't read the papers,
but I know there was a crash,

668
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,240
and nothing is certain
and money loses value.

669
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,960
Instead of money, give me gold.

670
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,480
Gold. Yes, I will give you gold.

671
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:57,920
In uncertain times,
gold is always certain.

672
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,680
I will give you gold.

673
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:01,880
And you will help me find
this woman.

674
00:52:01,880 --> 00:52:04,520
And she will spare my daughter.

675
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:25,440
Lizzie! Where the fuck were you?

676
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:28,400
Where were you?

677
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,040
Where the fuck were you?

678
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:37,080
She's gone, Tommy.

679
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,080
She's gone.

680
00:52:44,360 --> 00:52:46,320
Just now. At 5.17.

681
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:54,520
You weren't fucking here, were you?

682
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:56,960
Were you?

683
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,880
It was before then, and she
was here, and then she was gone,

684
00:53:11,880 --> 00:53:14,040
and now she's gone to where
they've put the dead.

685
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:19,000
They've put her with
the dead people.

686
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:31,560
She was asking, just now, for you.

687
00:53:33,160 --> 00:53:34,200
But went...

688
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,360
..at 5.17.

689
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:49,080
I told her that you loved...

690
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:54,000
I gave her your kiss goodbye.
