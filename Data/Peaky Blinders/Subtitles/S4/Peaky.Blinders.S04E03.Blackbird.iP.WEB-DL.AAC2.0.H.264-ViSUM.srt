1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,880
I want you to be alive after your
entire family is dead

2
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,960
that is what will hurt you the most.

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,520
Michael is badly wounded.

4
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,880
John is dead.

5
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:12,960
So I sent a message to Aberama Gold.

6
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:14,800
I need you back. I'll help you

7
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:17,720
cos Michael wants me to help
you. Starting now.

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,440
The bullet's been written.

9
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,400
He, as the oldest brother...
I'll put this bullet into his head.

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:25,800
You said you'd bring every man
and woman out on strike.

11
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,120
Do you have a whistle?

12
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,600
WHISTLE BLOWS
It's almost as if you want trouble.

13
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,960
This programme contains
some violent scenes,

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,280
strong language from the start,
and some scenes of a sexual nature

15
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,200
CLAMOUR OF VOICES

16
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:08,880
All right. First come, first served,
form an orderly line, all of you.

17
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,400
All right. All right.

18
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,920
Right! Have your contracts of
employment in your hand!

19
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,720
Bring 'em in! Get in there.

20
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,800
Get moving! On you go!
Go on, keep going!

21
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:28,120
Keep going. Whoa, where
are you going? Bradley. Foreman.

22
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:31,520
All right. You go
and see that man over there. Go!

23
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,280
What's your name?
Bradley. I'm a foreman.

24
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:37,920
When did you last work here? 1922.

25
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,760
How many have done this
type of work before?

26
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,600
They're mostly farm hands from down
Worcester way. But I'll show 'em.

27
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,800
Hungry men learn fast.
All right. On you go.

28
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,320
Dirty scabs! Blacklegs!

29
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:50,360
GLASS SMASHES

30
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,200
What bastard threw that?
Get him out here!

31
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:07,400
Arthur! Oi! Enough. Get him out!

32
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,240
Get out!

33
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,800
Ten more!

34
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,840
Two more. Ten. That's it.
Close it up!

35
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,920
HEAVY DOORS CLOSE

36
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,040
Right. Ten bob a man.
Â£2 there for you.

37
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,640
What about security?
Yeah, well, about that...

38
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,560
By order of the city of Birmingham
police department,

39
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:37,400
you and your ugly workforce
are now under the protection...

40
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,120
..of the Peaky fucking Blinders.

41
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,680
DOOR OPENS

42
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,520
Mr Gray? Yeah, send him in.

43
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,920
It's your mother.

44
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,760
WHISPERS: Oh, fuck.

45
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,400
I read about it in the paper.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,440
I have a right.

47
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,920
I'm your mum, as well.

48
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,840
You want me to go away?

49
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,440
Yes.

50
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,240
I'll just leave these.

51
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,160
They're from our orchard.

52
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,560
You used to love these.

53
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,960
I hope there are no worms in them.

54
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:29,120
Look, I just wanted to say that
you're welcome to come home.

55
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,520
To get better at home.

56
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,680
I know you got
bored in the village, but...

57
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,880
..we love you -

58
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:42,480
and your little brother misses
playing football with you...

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,480
..and your dad...

60
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,200
..passed on.

61
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,000
He passed on
peacefully in our bed.

62
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,440
Fuck.

63
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,160
Now go on.

64
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,240
I'm expecting Tommy,
and he's due here now.

65
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,760
I'll go, then.

66
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,480
I'll not be in the same
room as that man.

67
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,480
CAR PULLS UP OUTSIDE

68
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:04,280
DOOR OPENS

69
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,000
Come on, Pol, Tommy's expecting us.

70
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,440
Who's with us?

71
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,400
Isaiah and two Lee boys.

72
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,760
Ada, how long
since you've had a fuck?

73
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,640
What?

74
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,680
It's been nearly two years with me.

75
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,160
Over Christmas I counted it up.

76
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:29,320
So, I've made a New Year's
resolution to change the situation.

77
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:32,200
Oh. Anyone particular in mind?

78
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,640
Not really.

79
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:37,800
Just me and someone unsuitable.

80
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,400
# From starry eyes colliding

81
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,960
# From Mars to someone crying... #

82
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,040
I'll sit in the front.

83
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,160
# I'm never far away

84
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,520
# No matter what I'm hiding

85
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:07,400
# I get lost

86
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:11,200
# But I always come around

87
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,560
# Call when you're ready
cos I'm ready to ride. #

88
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,200
So, this is just
to make things official.

89
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,960
Your official return
to the company payroll.

90
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,440
So no more talk
of New Year's resolutions

91
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:26,320
or Tommy might change his mind.

92
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,800
What New Year's resolution?
Never mind.

93
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,200
I think Ada's trying to tell me
to behave myself.

94
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:35,160
Yeah. Behave yourself.

95
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,720
Behave myself or what?

96
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,960
Behave myself or fucking what?

97
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,040
OK, Polly, I'll tell you the truth.

98
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:48,960
After your recent troubles, Tommy
asked me to keep an eye on you.

99
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,000
"Troubles?"

100
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,280
Whilst working for this company,

101
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,960
I have killed a man,

102
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,640
I have lost a man,
I have found a son,

103
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,080
I have nearly lost a son,
I have nearly lost my own life.

104
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,400
Now, I will accept my job back,

105
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,440
if the terms on offer
are favourable...

106
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:12,960
..but I will not behave myself.

107
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:28,080
Sorry I'm late.

108
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,480
Where's Arthur?

109
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,720
Do I look like his fucking mother?

110
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:01,240
Oh, no. Why are you here?

111
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,480
You all right? Is Billy all right?

112
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,560
Yes. Everything's fine.

113
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,800
Well, look... Lovely to see you,
but I'm late for a meeting.

114
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,320
They can wait.

115
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,520
I've got something for you.

116
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:23,800
Something for a loving husband
who's been working very hard...

117
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,520
..and is under a great
deal of pressure.

118
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:33,800
Something to relieve his stress.

119
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:44,440
It's silk. From Japan.

120
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,480
Feel.

121
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,280
My hands are dirty.

122
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,960
Good.

123
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,800
Feel all of it.

124
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,560
Feel it properly.

125
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:11,880
You, er... You want to do this here?

126
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,240
Why not? I thought
you were the boss.

127
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,200
I am the fucking boss.
Then tell me what to do, boss.

128
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,840
Come here.

129
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:28,040
Right, before we start this
extraordinary general meeting

130
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:31,360
of the board of the Shelby
Company Limited,

131
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,000
I'd like to note the absence
of the Deputy Vice President,

132
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,560
who has not yet arrived.

133
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,800
We'll continue without his presence.

134
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,240
HE CLEARS THROAT
Item number one.

135
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:47,040
The reinstatement of the Shelby
Company Limited company treasurer.

136
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,600
The board welcomes back
the former treasure,

137
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,640
with generously improved
terms and conditions.

138
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,280
Due to the exceptionally
difficult circumstances

139
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,080
the company now finds itself in.

140
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,520
The proposed treasurer will now
check the terms and conditions,

141
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,880
to see if they are in order.

142
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,440
Item number two, during the absence
of the Company Accountant,

143
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,600
due to ill health,

144
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:12,360
all responsibility for the keeping
of the Company Accounts

145
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:14,520
pass to the head of acquisitions.

146
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:19,760
Item number three.
The Company Treasurer,

147
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,800
having read the terms and condition,

148
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,920
lodges a signed contract
of employment agreeing

149
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,760
to the terms and conditions
with the temporary head of accounts.

150
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,560
All those in favour of the
reinstatement of Mrs Elizabeth Gray

151
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,960
to the position of The Shelby
Company treasurer,

152
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,760
please raise your hands.

153
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,840
Why, goodness. Thank you.

154
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,640
Any other business?

155
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:44,320
Right, I declare this extraordinary
general meeting over.

156
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,480
Now we talk about
the real business...

157
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,520
..but, for that, we need Arthur.

158
00:11:50,520 --> 00:11:52,360
Where the fuck is Arthur?

159
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,960
SHE EXCLAIMS

160
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,720
KNOCK ON DOOR

161
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,240
Mr Shelby! Fuck off.

162
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,920
They've broken into the paint shop.
Oh, yeah?

163
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,600
They're chucking paint around -

164
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,440
I think they mean
to set light to it.

165
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:28,480
Well, you deal with it, man,
I'm fucking busy!

166
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,040
What was all that about?

167
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,440
In this sinful place,

168
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,760
there will be temptations.

169
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,960
It's my responsibility as your wife

170
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,480
to help you resist
those temptations.

171
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,840
By putting myself between you...

172
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,000
..and the devil.

173
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,000
In the words of my sinful
Catholic mother,

174
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,440
"Keep his balls empty
and his belly full."

175
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:42,800
God rest her soul.

176
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,320
KNOCK ON DOOR
Mr Shelby!

177
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,440
You have to come to the
paint shop immediately! Please!

178
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,080
Oh, I have to go.

179
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,760
Won't be late.

180
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,520
Sorry, ladies,
there's no smoking in here.

181
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,360
Yes, love, we know.

182
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,480
All right. He's an hour late.
Fuck him.

183
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:17,520
This business directly affects
Arthur, but he's not here,

184
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,320
so we'll take a vote without him.

185
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,640
What business?

186
00:14:21,640 --> 00:14:24,320
Official business that wasn't
on your agenda, Ada.

187
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:29,400
An informant told us
that six years ago Luca Changretta

188
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,760
came from New York to Birmingham to
be best man at his cousin's wedding.

189
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:35,560
We found out that they used
Reid and Dunn in Broadgate

190
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,760
for the photographs.

191
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:41,280
The photographer kept the negatives.
I persuaded him to give us copies...

192
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,640
..and to enlarge this one.

193
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,080
That is Luca Changretta.

194
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,800
I've seen his face,
so I could pick him out.

195
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,640
Half the men in the photograph
are Changrettas,

196
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,000
which means the chances are
they're the men will come kill us.

197
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,960
We need to get both these
photographs

198
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,680
into pubs and on street corners,

199
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,240
and put it about that there's
a reward for information.

200
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:10,520
We also propose that we give
a copy of this photograph

201
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:12,600
to Mr Aberama Gold.

202
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,800
We need to forget the idea that it
has to be Arthur

203
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:19,480
that pulls the trigger.
Tradition will just fuck us up.

204
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,200
We should wait for Arthur.

205
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:23,360
Arthur's not here, Ada.

206
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,240
We need Luca Changretta dead.
That's it.

207
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:30,520
Dropping the law of the bullet is
part of the process of modernisation

208
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,320
that I was working on
before I were...

209
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,360
..before I was executed.

210
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,960
You weren't executed, Pol.

211
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,560
What did you call me?

212
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,160
Right. Let's take a vote.
I'll deal with Arthur.

213
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,080
All those in favour of giving
the photographs

214
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,840
to Mr Gold raise your hand.

215
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,120
Then it will be done.

216
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,520
Mum... Oh, "mum" now, is it?

217
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,640
I smelt perfume when I came in here.

218
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,920
Yeah, it was the flowers.

219
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,720
Right, that's it.

220
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,280
Who came in here, Michael?

221
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,560
The truth is, Polly, the woman
that raised him came in here.

222
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,040
She has every right to come in here.

223
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,000
She brought him fucking apples
and she left.

224
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,760
We're in the middle of a vendetta
and Arthur's missing.

225
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,240
We need to find him.

226
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:27,240
Concentrate on what unites us.

227
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,920
This is all temporary.

228
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,480
Yeah, temporary, right.

229
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,400
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

230
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,720
# There's a devil inside of me

231
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,080
# He's holding on... #

232
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:47,520
Bastards!

233
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:52,280
# And I don't know if he's staying
or for how long

234
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,200
# There's a devil inside of me

235
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,680
# And he's holding on

236
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:07,320
# And I don't know if he's staying
or for how long... #

237
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:11,240
Party is it, eh? Is that what it is?

238
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:15,080
What's this, a party, eh?
Fuck off out of it!

239
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:16,720
Get out!

240
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:26,960
OK, I wasn't going to hit ya...
but that wasn't fucking nice.

241
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,240
Oh, you...

242
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,000
Arthur! Mr Shelby!
Please, Mr Shelby! Please.

243
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:46,280
Don't fucking move.
Eh? Eh? Now get the fuck out!

244
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,120
Fuck you and fuck your revolution!

245
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,040
I'm a fucking mess.

246
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,320
GUNFIRE

247
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,560
Where are you going?

248
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,960
Come here.

249
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,480
Fucking hit man, are you?

250
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,640
Is that what you are?

251
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,080
Arthur Shelby, hey!

252
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,800
Let's see who wanted you.

253
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:43,560
What about...

254
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:47,200
What about fucking John Shelby?

255
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,880
John.

256
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,600
Thank you.

257
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,200
Send my guests in.

258
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,520
You wire Polo and let him
tell the family.

259
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,480
He has four kids.

260
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,560
Don't you two have any other
clothes to wear?

261
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,760
Uh?

262
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,360
Look at me.

263
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,640
Huh?

264
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,240
I'm here as a lover of theatre.

265
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,560
They kill two of our men...

266
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,560
..you complain about
your fucking belly.

267
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,920
Luca.

268
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,560
Luca, con tutto rispetto...

269
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,440
With respect... "With respect?"

270
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,120
You raised.

271
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,960
"With respect?"

272
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,680
Open your mouth.

273
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:20,080
Come on...

274
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,800
Open your fucking mouth!

275
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,240
You fucking dress like them.

276
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:27,240
You eat like them.

277
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,200
You don't fucking talk to me
about "with respect".

278
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:51,720
Sit down.

279
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:02,680
What do you have?

280
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:16,640
Arthur Shelby killed her
son in a boxing ring four years ago.

281
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,840
She would do that for us?

282
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,320
OK.

283
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,080
Anyone seen Arthur?

284
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,120
Anyone seen Arthur? Hey?

285
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,920
In your office, Tom.

286
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:31,320
If you're not going to show up
for a family meeting,

287
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,760
you let someone know.
We thought you were dead,

288
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:36,560
there's 15 fucking
Italians out there.

289
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:39,680
No, there's not, there's 13.

290
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,640
I just killed two of them.

291
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,800
Ripped out their hearts
and burnt their bones to ash.

292
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,920
I did it.

293
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:54,360
Me. Your brother.

294
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,720
Not fucking Aberama Gold
or his punch-drunk son.

295
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,560
But me!

296
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,040
Even if you don't trust me no more.

297
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,480
What the fuck are you talking about?
Arthur?

298
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:10,360
I got cleaned up at Ada's.

299
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,200
She told me,
you took a vote in my absence.

300
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,760
All right, calm down and
tell me about the men you killed.

301
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:21,400
You put my job out for contract.

302
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,800
Arthur...

303
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:26,120
Yeah, well, I'm going to make it
my fucking job anyway.

304
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,040
Because this was all my fault.

305
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:31,840
It was me that shot the old man...
Yeah, out of mercy.

306
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,120
Aye, now John's dead,

307
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,000
he's dead because of me,
and I want to make it right.

308
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,920
Arthur, wait.

309
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,920
How did the men get in the factory?
I need to know.

310
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,640
Through the back fucking door

311
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:55,240
that was supposed to be locked
and bolted.

312
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:59,720
Some bastard gave me up.
Somebody with keys.

313
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:05,600
Yeah. Why don't you sit there
and work it out for yourself?

314
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:09,480
And take a fucking vote.

315
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,920
Who is this little bear? Yes?

316
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,520
Eh?

317
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,600
Are you all right?

318
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,920
Daddy's home, Billy.

319
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:46,160
Yeah, I'm all right.
Look, Daddy's home.

320
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,320
How's Polly?

321
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,040
Is she all right?

322
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:02,480
Oh, go on, Linda.
I mean, it was her idea, wasn't it?

323
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,760
Hum? The Japanese silk?

324
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:08,400
I'll put him to bed.

325
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,880
SHE OPENS DOOR

326
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,960
You kept me away
from that fucking meeting

327
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,840
to stop me from voting. Here we go.

328
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,360
It was Polly's idea, wasn't it?

329
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,800
Eh?

330
00:28:29,800 --> 00:28:33,800
You know what I am, don't ya?
I am a working man.

331
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,480
Yeah.

332
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,720
Fucking working man.

333
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:44,120
Fucking...who's lost his job.

334
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,640
Is that what I am, Linda?

335
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,320
Is that what I am, eh?

336
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:58,840
I don't want you dead.
Polly doesn't want you dead.

337
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,880
Let Mr Gold do the killing.
For money.

338
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,080
It's the modern way, Arthur.

339
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,920
Watch.

340
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:21,760
What are you doing?

341
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:27,360
Now fire it into the fireplace.

342
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,960
Please.

343
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:35,040
All right. Fire it.

344
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,360
Get rid of it.

345
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:45,360
Then we'll go to bed.

346
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:48,240
Do anything you like.

347
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,680
Just fire the gun, Arthur.

348
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,160
Fire it.

349
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:57,920
You go tell Polly...

350
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,960
..there are rules
between a man and women.

351
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:07,080
Fucking rules.

352
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,000
That I have to do this.

353
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,880
I have to do it.

354
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,640
John wants me to do it, Linda.

355
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,320
My brother.

356
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,000
And I'm going to do it.

357
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:24,200
Was it fear, or was it hatred?

358
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,600
Was what fear or hatred? Isaiah...

359
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:39,840
You had a one way ticket
to Glasgow in your pocket.

360
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,680
Your wife and kids
left three days ago.

361
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,800
Now...I'm going to ask you again.

362
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:58,400
Was it fear of the Italians,
or hatred of us

363
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,600
that made you unlock the door
and give up my brother?

364
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,520
I didn't unlock any door.

365
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:10,440
Here, have a drink.

366
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,400
You're going to need it.

367
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,760
35 Drumcree Street,
Parkhead, Glasgow...

368
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,640
Please, please, please, please...

369
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,680
We have allegiances with Catholic
gangs in that city.

370
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:30,680
Your family are safe
only at my discretion.

371
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:35,880
Now...explain to me...

372
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,640
..why you were catching
a midnight train to Glasgow.

373
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,360
You mean you don't know?

374
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:46,840
I run a factory full of blackleg,
non-union labour.

375
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:50,280
I live in a street full of men
laid off or on strike.

376
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,720
Look at this photograph, Mr Devlin,

377
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,880
and tell me who are the men
who contacted you... No.

378
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,680
No, you listen to me.

379
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,920
I get spat at,

380
00:32:59,920 --> 00:33:02,560
windows smashed,
petrol on the curtains...

381
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:06,040
..but, for fear of you,
I clock in every fucking morning -

382
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:09,840
and, today, two men are shot
and burnt on my shift...

383
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:12,840
..and you ask me why I'm getting
the midnight train to Glasgow?

384
00:33:22,560 --> 00:33:24,880
Who else has the keys to that door?

385
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,440
They hang on a hook
inside my office.

386
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,960
Today, I left the office unlocked.

387
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:34,600
Why? Because I forgot.
Because I left in a hurry.

388
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,440
Because there were men trying
to set fire to the factory!

389
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,480
Mr Shelby, may I tell you something?

390
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:46,000
You have a lot of enemies.

391
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,320
Communists.

392
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,800
Italians.

393
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,360
Before the factory came out
on strike,

394
00:33:57,360 --> 00:34:01,680
I heard word that two Italians
attended a Communist Party meeting

395
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:04,600
in Stechford.
They hardly spoke English.

396
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,040
Now, if they got a party man
into the factory

397
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:12,240
it might have been him
that unlocked the door for them.

398
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,440
Mr Shelby...my train leaves at 12.

399
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,400
It's just gone 11.
I could still make it.

400
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,240
Please. For my kids.

401
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,800
I need you here.

402
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:41,480
Isaiah, get three of our men
with police badges

403
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:44,840
to watch Mr Devlin's house.
Mr Shelby, please...

404
00:34:47,720 --> 00:34:50,560
Our friends in Glasgow
will take care of your family.

405
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:54,200
For the curtains.

406
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:59,240
Before you, I was
an ordinary working man.

407
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:02,240
Yeah, and now you're one of us.

408
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,520
MUSIC: Bye Bye Blackbird
by Gene Austin

409
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,480
SHE SINGS ALONG:
# Blackbird, blackbird

410
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,000
# Singing the blues all day

411
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:43,040
# Right outside of my door... #

412
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,680
MUSIC CONTINUES

413
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,120
HE KNOCKS

414
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,400
MUSIC STOPS

415
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,120
Who is it?

416
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,640
It's Tommy Shelby.

417
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,200
Is this union business?

418
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,520
Yes.

419
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,840
So, conduct it in the proper
place at the proper time.

420
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,920
I've come to make an improved offer.

421
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:34,760
I heard music.

422
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,200
What's your improved offer?

423
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,040
Do I not get a drink?

424
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,440
No.

425
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:53,080
Have you ever seen any of the men
in this photograph before? What?

426
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,680
You're a member
of the Stechford Communist party.

427
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:04,960
I'm told two Italian men
attended a meeting recently.

428
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,960
Can you see either of them
in this picture?

429
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:13,920
As the Small Heath coordinator

430
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:17,280
of the Organisation for the
Maintenance of Supplies,

431
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,760
I have also
been sworn in as a Special...

432
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,920
SHE SIGHS

433
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,520
We have reason to believe
that outside agitators from overseas

434
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:28,480
are attempting to foment
trouble in our factories

435
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,280
in advance of a General Strike,

436
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,440
which could take place
at any moment.

437
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:34,600
This is a matter
of national security.

438
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,560
May I look at your badge?

439
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,280
Yes.

440
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,240
What would you like to drink,
Constable?

441
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:55,960
Whisky.
And, actually, it's Sergeant.

442
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,680
I only have beer. Times are hard.

443
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:01,600
How long has it been since
you've had a bottle of M&B bitter?

444
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,120
Help yourself.

445
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:08,960
Have a seat.

446
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:20,680
You know, when this business began,
I did some research on you.

447
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,640
It turns out I know someone
who used to know you very well.

448
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,400
Kitty Jurossi.

449
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,200
You were in love with
Kitty's sister, Greta Jurossi,

450
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,680
before the war.
Do you remember Greta Jurossi?

451
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,840
Her parents were Italian.

452
00:38:39,840 --> 00:38:42,400
They didn't approve
of a Watery Lane Gypsy...

453
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,960
..but you won them over.
With your charm.

454
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:47,000
Sweetness.

455
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:53,360
Very... Very thorough research.

456
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:57,360
Greta died at the age of 19.
Of consumption...

457
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,080
..and Kitty said you were
at her bedside for three months.

458
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,000
Every day. Holding her hand...

459
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,800
..and after she died,
you went away to war.

460
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,680
Kitty said that the sweet boy
who left never came back.

461
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,400
No-one came back.

462
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,520
Here's the funniest thing.

463
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:23,160
She said, in those days,
you believed in things.

464
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,960
In justice. Fairness.

465
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,640
Once you saw a man beating
his horse, and you fought him.

466
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,480
He was twice your size,
but you beat him...

467
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:32,440
..and then you beat him
with his own whip.

468
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:36,560
Kitty always liked
to tell tall tales.

469
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,160
She's a party member now.

470
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,600
She swears before you enlisted
in the army

471
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,800
you joined the
Communist Party yourself.

472
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:50,280
Is that true?

473
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:58,360
MUSIC STARTS

474
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,200
When I was at the door,

475
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:05,240
I saw you through the curtains.

476
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:08,320
You were dancing alone.

477
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,000
I've also done my research.

478
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,520
Your sweetheart
was at Passchendaele.

479
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,160
When he came back, he was
listed among the shellshocked.

480
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:30,800
Blew his own fucking brains out.

481
00:40:39,680 --> 00:40:41,720
I don't know any men in the photo.

482
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,880
You haven't looked.

483
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:51,360
This afternoon,
two men came into my factory

484
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:53,240
and tried to kill my brother.

485
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:56,240
I believe a Stechford
Communist Party member let him in.

486
00:40:56,240 --> 00:41:00,080
I was wondering if you might be able
to help me in my investigations.

487
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:10,360
Kitty said next time I see you,
before we start fighting,

488
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:13,440
I should send you her love
from the good old days...

489
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:15,080
..and give you this.

490
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,920
Greta Jurossi and Tommy Shelby
in Blackpool.

491
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:34,080
Do you recognise
the boy in the photograph?

492
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:58,880
I'll leave that here.

493
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,760
Apologies for interrupting
your dance.

494
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,400
# I wish

495
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:56,520
# I wish

496
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:02,000
# But it's all in vain

497
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:06,480
# I wish I was

498
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,320
# A maid again

499
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:14,560
# But a maid again

500
00:43:14,560 --> 00:43:20,200
# I never can be

501
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:27,520
# Till apples grow... #

502
00:43:27,520 --> 00:43:32,080
Arthur, I need you to listen to me.

503
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:36,080
I need you to listen to me,
Arthur.

504
00:43:39,880 --> 00:43:41,600
The world is changing.

505
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,360
Listen to me, Arthur.

506
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:52,480
Listen to the sweet
voice of Jesus.

507
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:54,840
Finn? It came from Arthur's house.

508
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:57,840
HE BANGS ON DOOR
Arthur.

509
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:01,960
Arthur.

510
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:03,520
Where is he?

511
00:45:05,360 --> 00:45:06,680
Arthur?

512
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:09,640
He fired the bullet.

513
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:13,840
Linda...

514
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:18,400
..says it's the modern way, so...

515
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:23,360
It's the modern way.

516
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:27,320
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, it's all right.

517
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,520
It's all right, brother.

518
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:38,800
You did well.

519
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:40,800
God spoke to him, not me.

520
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,400
What are you doing here?

521
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:09,360
On Mondays, I do the inventory.

522
00:46:09,360 --> 00:46:11,880
Make sure nobody's
dipping their hand.

523
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:15,280
Well, it's now my job now.

524
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,080
I'm back -

525
00:46:18,080 --> 00:46:20,680
and there's going to be nobody
dipping their hand with me here,

526
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:22,840
not unless they want it cut off.

527
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,440
DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES

528
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,680
I said to Arthur,
while I'm in this fucking place,

529
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:38,600
I want something to keep
my mind busy.

530
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:40,240
What? You're going to take bets?

531
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,840
I've always been able to do addition
and subtraction

532
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,040
without pen and paper -

533
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:45,800
but I'll need a telephone.

534
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:49,680
Apparently, we have special clients
who take bets by telephone.

535
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:50,760
Linda?

536
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:54,640
This is a betting shop.

537
00:46:54,640 --> 00:46:56,680
Look...

538
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,960
..Arthur said yes. Tommy said yes.

539
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,480
But did God say yes?
Gambling is a sin, Linda.

540
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:03,920
It's not me
that's doing the gambling.

541
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,080
I'm just taking the bets.

542
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:18,840
The rule is that door should
always remain locked until 9am.

543
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,760
Right. Boy.
Boy, where are you going?

544
00:47:24,760 --> 00:47:27,960
Well, Arthur's not coming in today.
He's taking the day off.

545
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:30,000
So... So what?

546
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,120
So, today,
Tommy said that I'm in charge.

547
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:34,920
Sorry, you're in charge?

548
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:38,280
Yeah. That's what he said.

549
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,520
All right, sweetheart.

550
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:54,840
Ladies, let's give our boss a first
day that he'll never forget.

551
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,920
Sending Finn to the shop
was a mistake.

552
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:10,120
They've already found out he's a
virgin and they're arranging

553
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:11,720
a girl for him this afternoon.

554
00:48:11,720 --> 00:48:13,520
I thought Linda was there.

555
00:48:13,520 --> 00:48:15,880
She is. She loved the idea.

556
00:48:17,120 --> 00:48:19,120
Yeah, I know. She even swears now.

557
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:22,200
"Fuck" sounds funny coming from her.

558
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,640
Polly says in the end
we all turn into our mother.

559
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:27,200
Ah, well, keep an eye on her.

560
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,640
The whore watching the Madonna.

561
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:35,080
Does Finn know what
they've planned? No.

562
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,160
Do they have someone?

563
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,280
Yes. A girl I used to work with.

564
00:48:42,840 --> 00:48:46,520
Is she nice? No. She's from Aston.

565
00:48:46,520 --> 00:48:48,800
They're paying her
out of petty cash.

566
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:54,320
Right, well, call 'em and tell them
to pay extra and get someone nice.

567
00:48:55,440 --> 00:49:00,000
Nice women don't do that sort of
thing. Yes, they do. What about you?

568
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:06,040
I mean, in the past. Come on.

569
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,720
Where are we going?

570
00:49:07,720 --> 00:49:10,080
Somewhere I've not
been in a long time.

571
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:18,000
WILDFOWL CALL AND SQUAWK

572
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:30,520
Are we expecting somebody?

573
00:49:33,960 --> 00:49:36,000
Tommy, I'm fucking freezing here.

574
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,280
We used to come here.

575
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:46,720
She'd wait for hours for me,
when I couldn't make it...

576
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:52,520
..and I'd wait for her,
if her family kept her in.

577
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:55,760
Who?

578
00:49:58,320 --> 00:49:59,440
Some girl.

579
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,280
Some girl before France.

580
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,840
I've not been back here since...

581
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,200
..but I wanted to come here
with you.

582
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:32,400
Are you kissing her or me?

583
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,560
You.

584
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,480
I want Shelby Company Limited

585
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:29,200
to increase non-taxable charitable
contributions to local charities

586
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,640
by 25% as of now...

587
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:37,560
..and I'm going to build two new
institutes for destitute children.

588
00:51:37,560 --> 00:51:40,200
One in Saltley, one in Digbeth.

589
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,560
I've already identified
the buildings.

590
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:44,240
Two former workhouses.

591
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:48,120
I want you to be
in charge of the project.

592
00:51:50,560 --> 00:51:52,360
Right, come on, let's go.

593
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:53,840
Why?

594
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:04,320
Because I promised someone
I was going to change the world.

595
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:11,320
You do realise, Tommy,
we're all going fucking mad here.

596
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:15,560
Yeah, I know. Come on.

597
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,840
Finn? Come here.

598
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,520
How was your day?

599
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:38,000
Yeah, it was OK.

600
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,400
Good man. Well done.

601
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,040
No trouble?

602
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:45,040
No. No trouble.

603
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:48,920
And she looked after you?

604
00:52:53,840 --> 00:52:56,840
I don't want it like that
ever again, Tom.

605
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,200
Not when they don't even want to
do it, except for the money.

606
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:05,040
Everything's for the money, Finn.
Yeah, I know. But, er...

607
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,120
She said "be a man".

608
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:12,440
And were you a man?

609
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,880
Yeah...

610
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:20,080
..but then I apologised to her,
cos she just looked so tired.

611
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:25,000
Sit down, Finn.

612
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:33,160
Right, listen to me, Finn.
She was right.

613
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:36,000
You need to be a fucking man.

614
00:53:37,040 --> 00:53:38,960
People get tired.

615
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:41,200
Working in a fucking factory
gets you tired.

616
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:44,760
I don't go round apologising. Do I?

617
00:53:44,760 --> 00:53:45,800
No.

618
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:47,800
There's an empty space here
to be filled.

619
00:53:47,800 --> 00:53:51,440
Do you understand? Yeah.

620
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:53,600
So, be a fucking man.

621
00:53:56,760 --> 00:53:57,800
OK, Tom.

622
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:43,600
Champagne, please. Of course.

623
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:51,040
Madam, women alone
are not allowed at the bar.

624
00:54:51,040 --> 00:54:53,120
Will someone be joining you?

625
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,200
What do you think?

626
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:42,440
This is public enough, no?

627
00:55:44,120 --> 00:55:46,040
Yes.

628
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,800
So?

629
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:54,080
The boy in the hospital
is out of bounds...

630
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:56,480
..and I'll ask you to spare
Finn and Arthur.

631
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:01,760
In return for what?

632
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:07,920
Tommy Shelby.

633
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,320
And, er, why should I trust you?

634
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:20,280
Because you know our history.

635
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,120
You know what happened between us.

636
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:30,600
You are an unlikely Cassius.

637
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:41,280
You know, my mother...

638
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,800
My mother knew your mother.

639
00:56:45,640 --> 00:56:48,080
She taught her how to read.

640
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,640
Did she tell you that John
and Arthur spared her life?

641
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:55,040
When Tommy wanted her dead.

642
00:56:57,000 --> 00:57:00,720
Yeah - and now she's giving me
the information about you people.

643
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:05,120
So, Tommy Shelby was right.

644
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:13,680
His ruthlessness...was justified.

645
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:18,760
You should have killed her
when you had the chance.

646
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,360
John was a good boy.

647
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:27,720
Arthur tries.

648
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:31,040
Tommy's different.

649
00:57:33,120 --> 00:57:36,160
You take Tommy. Spare the rest.

650
00:57:40,760 --> 00:57:46,320
You know, my mother used
to say this about you.

651
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:50,320
She said, "That Polly Gray,

652
00:57:50,320 --> 00:57:54,640
"that child would never let
go of a grievance...

653
00:57:59,440 --> 00:58:01,080
"..and she loves to dance."

654
00:58:06,200 --> 00:58:08,280
What do you say, hm?

655
00:58:08,280 --> 00:58:10,240
You want to dance?

656
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,960
I don't dance any more.

657
00:58:20,320 --> 00:58:22,320
Yeah, that's a shame...

658
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:31,800
..cos you're dancing with me.
