1
00:00:00,026 --> 00:00:02,273
If the Italians win, they're not leaving.

2
00:00:02,299 --> 00:00:03,880
They're coming and they're here to stay.

3
00:00:03,905 --> 00:00:07,125
The intelligence services in London
sent seven officers to Birmingham.

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,367
At the top of their list is Ada Thorne.

5
00:00:09,546 --> 00:00:12,712
Alfie Solomons runs the fighter.
He says it's money for nothing.

6
00:00:12,739 --> 00:00:16,298
That there is the Southern
Counties welterweight champion.

7
00:00:16,353 --> 00:00:18,272
Name the day, Mr Shelby.

8
00:00:18,297 --> 00:00:20,776
Stop drinking whisky, switch to stout,

9
00:00:20,801 --> 00:00:23,227
then go and see a doctor about that baby.

10
00:00:23,227 --> 00:00:25,386
Make sure Tommy keeps that Friday free.

11
00:00:25,387 --> 00:00:27,546
Tell him I have an appointment for him.

12
00:00:27,547 --> 00:00:29,226
You've agreed to give up Tommy...

13
00:00:29,227 --> 00:00:30,267
..to save my life.

14
00:00:32,427 --> 00:00:36,707
This programme contains some violent
scenes and very strong language

15
00:01:18,827 --> 00:01:20,427
Shoot out his tyres.

16
00:01:23,855 --> 00:01:28,180
But remember, I fire the final shot!

17
00:02:15,067 --> 00:02:17,187
Stay inside, love!

18
00:02:45,027 --> 00:02:46,347
Come on!

19
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:01,307
Go. Go. Go!

20
00:03:15,347 --> 00:03:16,707
Come on!

21
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,026
It's all right, love. It's all
right. Come inside. Come inside.

22
00:03:34,027 --> 00:03:36,267
Stay inside, don't come out.

23
00:04:45,227 --> 00:04:47,146
Get away from the window.

24
00:04:47,147 --> 00:04:49,267
Right, stay inside and stay down.

25
00:05:01,787 --> 00:05:04,786
Everyone, stay indoors, stay down!

26
00:05:04,787 --> 00:05:06,746
By order of the Peaky Blinders!

27
00:05:06,747 --> 00:05:07,907
Come on!

28
00:05:59,467 --> 00:06:00,627
Come here.

29
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:13,020
Which way? Which way did he go?

30
00:06:16,307 --> 00:06:17,827
You sure?

31
00:07:48,586 --> 00:07:49,626
Oi!

32
00:07:55,547 --> 00:07:56,627
Luca.

33
00:07:57,255 --> 00:07:59,307
_
No!

34
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:02,179
_

35
00:08:02,896 --> 00:08:04,609
_

36
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,610
_

37
00:08:18,616 --> 00:08:20,616
_

38
00:08:21,884 --> 00:08:23,884
_

39
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:48,026
Hey, I know you own the cops in
this dirty

40
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:52,580
fucking town, but you'll be dead
before they get here!

41
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:58,900
Come on. Me and you, Tommy, come on!

42
00:09:12,904 --> 00:09:14,904
_

43
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:18,210
_

44
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:22,080
_

45
00:09:25,794 --> 00:09:27,794
_

46
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:31,611
_

47
00:10:01,587 --> 00:10:04,146
Enough! I said enough!

48
00:10:04,147 --> 00:10:07,546
I said enough! Now get out of it!

49
00:10:07,547 --> 00:10:10,986
Go on. Enough!

50
00:10:10,987 --> 00:10:12,906
What the fuck are you doing here?

51
00:10:12,907 --> 00:10:14,746
Saving your life.

52
00:10:14,747 --> 00:10:17,906
Or his. I'm a police officer, Tommy,

53
00:10:17,907 --> 00:10:21,986
I'm a fucking police officer, right?
Doing my duty.

54
00:10:21,987 --> 00:10:23,267
Stopping all this!

55
00:10:27,307 --> 00:10:29,586
There's three bodies need cleaning up.

56
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:32,386
No. Enough.

57
00:10:32,387 --> 00:10:35,186
Tell the people who live in these houses

58
00:10:35,187 --> 00:10:39,106
that they are free to go about their
lawful business.

59
00:10:39,107 --> 00:10:43,227
Tell them that the rule of law has
been restored.

60
00:10:44,627 --> 00:10:47,506
Haven't you heard, Tommy? Hey?

61
00:10:47,507 --> 00:10:49,027
Soldiers are coming.

62
00:11:23,147 --> 00:11:24,946
Do you know, I remember the very
first time

63
00:11:24,947 --> 00:11:27,186
you head butted a policeman.

64
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:28,866
And after you got your OBE from the King,

65
00:11:28,867 --> 00:11:30,907
I didn't think there'd be a next time.

66
00:11:39,627 --> 00:11:41,947
What do you think you're going to
tell Arthur?

67
00:11:43,667 --> 00:11:44,907
I'll tell him the truth.

68
00:11:49,387 --> 00:11:50,827
They're here.

69
00:12:10,910 --> 00:12:16,980
So. What the fuck happened today, Tom?

70
00:12:18,027 --> 00:12:20,986
We all heard, shooting
in Artillery Square.

71
00:12:20,987 --> 00:12:22,147
Yeah, there was.

72
00:12:23,627 --> 00:12:24,867
Today I killed three men.

73
00:12:26,827 --> 00:12:28,547
Now our enemies are down to eight.

74
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:36,666
I suppose they, er, I suppose they
took you by surprise, did they?

75
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:38,387
No. I knew they were coming.

76
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:45,307
Just after Christmas, I received a
letter from Luca Changretta...

77
00:12:46,587 --> 00:12:49,187
..offering to spare my son if I gave
up Tommy...

78
00:12:50,507 --> 00:12:51,986
..and I gave Tommy up.

79
00:12:51,987 --> 00:12:55,146
Because that was the plan that
Polly and I agreed on.

80
00:12:55,147 --> 00:12:59,386
I knew that Luca would want to pull
the trigger himself,

81
00:12:59,387 --> 00:13:01,627
so I used the set-up as bait to
bring him here.

82
00:13:02,787 --> 00:13:04,626
You're a fucking idiot, Tom!

83
00:13:04,627 --> 00:13:08,946
Look, I didn't get Luca but I got
three, all right? That's it.

84
00:13:08,947 --> 00:13:10,106
That's what happened.

85
00:13:11,147 --> 00:13:13,266
Come here, you. Aye, but he's right, ah.

86
00:13:13,267 --> 00:13:15,107
I mean, I thought you'd gone soft.

87
00:13:16,507 --> 00:13:17,626
So you got three?

88
00:13:17,627 --> 00:13:18,946
Yeah, I got three.

89
00:13:18,947 --> 00:13:21,947
Well, I'll drink to you, Tom, you
mad bastard.

90
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:33,786
Pretty soon you'll... You're going
to get the shakes

91
00:13:33,787 --> 00:13:37,586
when your blood cools down. Let's go
and get a drink.

92
00:13:37,587 --> 00:13:39,826
Dad? You got three what?

93
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:44,666
I got three shillings for a two
shilling horse, my boy.

94
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:45,707
You come with us, eh?

95
00:14:14,827 --> 00:14:18,860
You want a drink, Lizzie? I've had a
hard day.

96
00:14:19,827 --> 00:14:23,026
I don't drink whisky or gin any
more, Tom.

97
00:14:23,027 --> 00:14:24,307
Why not?

98
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,620
Because they say it harms the baby.

99
00:14:35,587 --> 00:14:38,426
Yes, it can only be yours.

100
00:14:38,868 --> 00:14:39,906
That day by the canal

101
00:14:39,907 --> 00:14:42,240
when you were fucking somebody else
in your head.

102
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,280
Except it wasn't her who got pregnant.

103
00:14:52,347 --> 00:14:53,587
Have a seat, Lizzie.

104
00:15:07,947 --> 00:15:09,746
All right, I know a woman, Lizzie...

105
00:15:09,747 --> 00:15:11,380
You know lots of women, Tommy.

106
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,740
If you don't know this already, you
don't know me -

107
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:16,826
I'm keeping it.

108
00:15:18,947 --> 00:15:21,187
Who's going to run my fucking office?

109
00:15:24,287 --> 00:15:25,847
You'll find somebody.

110
00:15:27,507 --> 00:15:32,986
Well, you'd better put a fucking
advert in the paper, then.

111
00:15:32,987 --> 00:15:34,587
I'm not laid up yet.

112
00:15:36,067 --> 00:15:38,587
You'll not go to work with a child
of mine inside of you.

113
00:15:42,627 --> 00:15:44,587
Fuck, now my hand shakes...

114
00:15:47,267 --> 00:15:50,467
It's OK, Tom. We'll be OK.

115
00:15:54,107 --> 00:15:58,907
All this death, Lizzie. Fuck,
let's have some life, eh?

116
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:08,169
I got three.

117
00:16:09,587 --> 00:16:10,627
I know, Tom.

118
00:16:14,187 --> 00:16:15,667
One of them point-blank.

119
00:16:17,147 --> 00:16:20,027
A baby. A little you and me.

120
00:16:23,987 --> 00:16:25,107
Point-blank, Lizzie.

121
00:16:28,507 --> 00:16:29,907
And he looked up at me.

122
00:16:42,827 --> 00:16:44,107
You'll get an allowance...

123
00:16:45,107 --> 00:16:46,627
..every week, from the company.

124
00:16:47,667 --> 00:16:49,466
Business is booming.

125
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,547
We'll, erm, buy a nice house, eh?

126
00:16:54,267 --> 00:16:55,827
Come on, I'll drive you home.

127
00:17:36,187 --> 00:17:37,587
I'm just looking.

128
00:18:16,587 --> 00:18:17,667
Hm?

129
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:37,386
DOOR OPENS Fuck! Linda?

130
00:18:37,387 --> 00:18:38,706
Arthur, you scared me to death.

131
00:18:38,707 --> 00:18:41,947
Linda, oh...

132
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:47,466
Linda, I need you to save me... again.

133
00:18:47,467 --> 00:18:49,586
You're drunk... again.

134
00:18:49,587 --> 00:18:51,267
I'm drunk again.

135
00:18:52,947 --> 00:18:54,467
I am drunk again.

136
00:18:56,907 --> 00:18:58,987
I need you to save me.

137
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:03,826
Tell me what you said to me this morning.

138
00:19:03,827 --> 00:19:05,983
Tell me. Tell me again.

139
00:19:06,707 --> 00:19:09,746
Tell me, say it. Say it.

140
00:19:09,747 --> 00:19:10,787
Tell me.

141
00:19:12,187 --> 00:19:14,666
We will be back in our garden

142
00:19:15,756 --> 00:19:18,427
before the time comes to plant
anything out.

143
00:19:20,627 --> 00:19:21,867
Just one winter.

144
00:19:23,027 --> 00:19:24,867
Just one winter.

145
00:19:31,787 --> 00:19:33,067
Come to bed, Arthur.

146
00:19:40,027 --> 00:19:41,627
They're coming, boys.

147
00:20:08,747 --> 00:20:13,626
No! No! No fucking way!

148
00:20:13,627 --> 00:20:15,667
You've never eaten hedgehog, Michael?

149
00:20:17,227 --> 00:20:18,826
I'm getting back in this car.

150
00:20:18,827 --> 00:20:22,386
Michael, you're number two on Luca
Changretta's hit list.

151
00:20:22,387 --> 00:20:24,266
Yeah, and I'll stay in a hotel.

152
00:20:24,267 --> 00:20:27,266
You stay in a hotel, I'll know
where you are,

153
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,826
so will the people who take you there,

154
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:31,146
so will the people who work in the hotel,

155
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,667
and hotels don't move around.

156
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:36,466
They don't even know where they'll
be tomorrow.

157
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:38,546
They follow the Patrin and the crows.

158
00:20:38,547 --> 00:20:40,426
And if anyone should come for you,
Michael,

159
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,747
the Palmers and the Boswells will
put up a fair fight.

160
00:20:47,027 --> 00:20:48,067
Take your medicine.

161
00:20:49,947 --> 00:20:52,626
- I'll take them.
- Your painkillers...

162
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:55,707
The healers up there will heal you
much quicker.

163
00:20:56,987 --> 00:20:59,386
Fucking witches, the lot of them.

164
00:20:59,387 --> 00:21:00,986
Show some respect, Mr Gray.

165
00:21:00,987 --> 00:21:04,307
They have agreed to welcome you on
account of your blood.

166
00:21:11,267 --> 00:21:14,747
Take your medicine, take the gun.

167
00:21:16,467 --> 00:21:19,587
I won't be able to contact you, so
you phone me.

168
00:21:21,507 --> 00:21:22,787
We'll make a plan.

169
00:21:26,214 --> 00:21:30,574
Tommy says it won't be long. Then
we'll be free.

170
00:21:38,987 --> 00:21:41,170
You might learn something.

171
00:21:43,347 --> 00:21:47,506
Tell them your grandmother was a
Gypsy princess,

172
00:21:47,507 --> 00:21:49,683
name of Birdie Boswell.

173
00:21:50,667 --> 00:21:52,707
You're royalty up there, Michael.

174
00:22:06,987 --> 00:22:08,627
Is that true, Mrs Gray?

175
00:22:10,227 --> 00:22:14,106
What? Don't I look like royalty?

176
00:22:14,107 --> 00:22:16,067
Now that you mention it, you do.

177
00:22:23,547 --> 00:22:26,107
I've been cooped up in Small Heath
too long.

178
00:22:28,587 --> 00:22:30,849
I can smell spring in the air.

179
00:22:36,107 --> 00:22:38,787
Do you know a longer way back, Mr Gold?

180
00:22:41,307 --> 00:22:44,492
I know ways back that would take forever.

181
00:22:45,507 --> 00:22:46,627
Get in, Your Majesty.

182
00:23:13,767 --> 00:23:15,687
I thought you were a busy woman.

183
00:23:18,446 --> 00:23:20,226
Do you have time for this?

184
00:23:20,227 --> 00:23:21,586
Is it a buck?

185
00:23:21,587 --> 00:23:22,627
It is a buck.

186
00:23:23,947 --> 00:23:26,820
Good. Bucks taste better.

187
00:23:36,347 --> 00:23:37,987
In the smoke I'm 16 again.

188
00:23:41,667 --> 00:23:44,946
You know, when the police were after
him, our dad used to take us out.

189
00:23:44,947 --> 00:23:47,307
We'd be gone for days, living on
what he caught.

190
00:23:49,747 --> 00:23:52,627
Oh, do you have a sharp knife?

191
00:24:04,947 --> 00:24:06,467
I heard you have second sight.

192
00:24:09,387 --> 00:24:11,227
I heard that you speak with the dead.

193
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:14,867
Yes.

194
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:22,066
Your wife is often around you.

195
00:24:22,067 --> 00:24:23,467
She watches you.

196
00:24:25,947 --> 00:24:27,307
Is she watching me now?

197
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:36,073
No.

198
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:42,066
Your family were healers?

199
00:24:42,067 --> 00:24:43,947
Yeah, a long time ago.

200
00:24:47,427 --> 00:24:49,827
Came back when I put my head in the
noose.

201
00:24:52,867 --> 00:24:56,907
It's like putting your head through
a window and seeing the whole world.

202
00:24:59,547 --> 00:25:00,987
Give me the rabbit...

203
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:04,387
..and the knife.

204
00:25:09,067 --> 00:25:15,906
You know, Polly, I believe it's
you who's kept Tommy Shelby alive

205
00:25:15,907 --> 00:25:17,466
all these years.

206
00:25:17,467 --> 00:25:19,267
Oh, we've kept each other alive.

207
00:25:22,627 --> 00:25:25,467
But I didn't just put my head
through that window...

208
00:25:27,187 --> 00:25:28,707
..I climbed through it.

209
00:25:30,587 --> 00:25:33,307
First I thought it was madness, but no.

210
00:25:35,027 --> 00:25:37,180
When you've put your head out of
that window

211
00:25:38,307 --> 00:25:41,290
you can do anything
you want,

212
00:25:42,723 --> 00:25:44,764
cos there are no rules...

213
00:25:47,427 --> 00:25:49,107
..cos there are no risks.

214
00:25:54,947 --> 00:25:56,587
Now give me the knife.

215
00:26:14,387 --> 00:26:16,227
Now, come here.

216
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:23,547
I can do whatever I want...

217
00:26:25,027 --> 00:26:26,587
..whenever the mood takes me.

218
00:26:28,827 --> 00:26:30,587
And you are a strong, handsome man...

219
00:26:32,707 --> 00:26:35,027
..and this is a beautiful place in
the world...

220
00:26:36,987 --> 00:26:41,187
..and it is this time...

221
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:57,786
But let me make one thing clear, Mr Gold,

222
00:26:57,787 --> 00:26:59,386
I just gave Michael a little speech

223
00:26:59,387 --> 00:27:01,747
about how no-one would know how to
find him...

224
00:27:02,947 --> 00:27:04,427
..but you'd know how to get him.

225
00:27:05,467 --> 00:27:09,819
If any harm comes to Michael, you
shall have me as your enemy.

226
00:27:11,347 --> 00:27:14,047
And none of your knives can kill me.

227
00:27:17,347 --> 00:27:18,547
Do you understand?

228
00:27:19,707 --> 00:27:20,747
Oh, I understand.

229
00:27:24,027 --> 00:27:25,682
Tute's a rinkeni moola.
_

230
00:27:27,842 --> 00:27:28,971
Abri.
_

231
00:28:21,833 --> 00:28:23,112
Mr Solomons?

232
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,440
Hm!

233
00:28:25,907 --> 00:28:28,906
My little cousin was born blind,

234
00:28:29,428 --> 00:28:33,306
but as a result I now donate a
considerable sum of money

235
00:28:33,307 --> 00:28:38,507
to a charity which gives dogs with
eyes to blind Jews.

236
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:45,026
The chairman of the board recommends
that those of us

237
00:28:45,027 --> 00:28:47,906
who were blessed with the gift of sight,

238
00:28:48,620 --> 00:28:50,039
that we spend, you know,

239
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:52,866
at least half an hour of our day
with our eyes closed

240
00:28:52,867 --> 00:28:56,387
so that we may, well, we may better
understand the, er...

241
00:28:57,587 --> 00:29:03,307
..the darkness and also to increase
our donations and that.

242
00:29:06,067 --> 00:29:07,507
What time is it?

243
00:29:10,627 --> 00:29:13,306
- 29 minutes past eight.
- Right.

244
00:29:13,307 --> 00:29:16,186
Well, then I have... I have another
minute to go, actually,

245
00:29:16,187 --> 00:29:17,883
but you, er,

246
00:29:18,769 --> 00:29:19,786
you can begin.

247
00:29:19,787 --> 00:29:20,827
Go on.

248
00:29:31,747 --> 00:29:34,026
I'm Luca Changretta.

249
00:29:34,027 --> 00:29:36,306
Oh, yeah, I know who you are.

250
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:38,546
You are a bit of a failure, aren't you?

251
00:29:38,547 --> 00:29:41,946
You come all the way over here to
this country

252
00:29:41,947 --> 00:29:44,826
in order to kill Tommy Shelby,

253
00:29:44,827 --> 00:29:48,546
but, I mean, well, he's not dead, is he?

254
00:29:48,547 --> 00:29:50,126
So... No.

255
00:29:50,127 --> 00:29:52,899
- No.
- He ain't.

256
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:55,067
How much time have I got left, mate?

257
00:29:57,827 --> 00:30:01,146
Ten seconds, nine seconds,

258
00:30:01,147 --> 00:30:02,187
eight seconds...

259
00:30:03,458 --> 00:30:10,590
..five, four, three, two, one.

260
00:30:12,387 --> 00:30:17,860
Right, hello. How can I help you?

261
00:30:21,547 --> 00:30:23,466
I have a proposition for you.

262
00:30:23,467 --> 00:30:27,346
Hmm, yeah, it's... I already know
what you want, yeah,

263
00:30:27,347 --> 00:30:30,346
but I just want to hear you say it
out loud

264
00:30:30,347 --> 00:30:33,660
so I can check how ridiculous it is.

265
00:30:43,787 --> 00:30:45,227
OK.

266
00:30:47,507 --> 00:30:50,106
We hear there's going to be a little
fight, you know,

267
00:30:50,107 --> 00:30:51,386
a boxing match,

268
00:30:51,387 --> 00:30:55,696
between your boy and Tommy Shelby's
boy, in Birmingham.

269
00:30:55,697 --> 00:30:56,975
Yep.

270
00:30:56,976 --> 00:31:00,906
And the whole Shelby family's
going to be there.

271
00:31:00,907 --> 00:31:06,020
And you, Mr Solomons, you too will
be there.

272
00:31:08,987 --> 00:31:11,946
That's it. I'll tell you what, right?

273
00:31:11,947 --> 00:31:16,866
Here's a gift, it's free - a
souvenir of your visit here.

274
00:31:16,867 --> 00:31:20,547
Goodbye, trot on. Down there is
Bonnie Street.

275
00:31:27,814 --> 00:31:30,241
You know, they say you are a smart guy.

276
00:31:31,787 --> 00:31:34,267
You already know what we want before
we say it.

277
00:31:36,067 --> 00:31:37,426
That's funny cos now

278
00:31:37,427 --> 00:31:43,387
I believe I know what you want even
before you say it.

279
00:31:44,907 --> 00:31:46,187
So, you going to taste it?

280
00:31:56,298 --> 00:32:00,606
_

281
00:32:03,018 --> 00:32:04,618
_

282
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:06,186
Damn fucking straight, mate,

283
00:32:06,187 --> 00:32:09,106
otherwise you wouldn't still be
thieving my oxygen, would you?

284
00:32:09,107 --> 00:32:11,266
Because I have 200 barrels a month, yeah,

285
00:32:11,267 --> 00:32:15,303
cleared by your people, distributed
through your teamsters.

286
00:32:15,304 --> 00:32:18,507
Thing is that people want gin these days.

287
00:32:19,787 --> 00:32:25,907
Well, the exit is still out there,
right, on Bonnie Street. Yeah?

288
00:32:27,947 --> 00:32:32,780
You're fucking crazy, you know
that? 200 barrels, ah?

289
00:32:35,347 --> 00:32:38,026
What do you think, cousin?

290
00:32:38,027 --> 00:32:39,667
But also I want some cash...

291
00:32:40,787 --> 00:32:43,506
..bung work. That's why I've broken
it down here -

292
00:32:43,507 --> 00:32:46,746
a list of costs pertaining to the
assassination

293
00:32:46,747 --> 00:32:48,466
of a dear friend, all right?

294
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:53,106
Now, a normal dispatch, well, it's,
you know, £500 cost.

295
00:32:53,107 --> 00:32:55,866
But you're going to have to add
another 100 to that

296
00:32:55,867 --> 00:33:00,746
because Tommy Shelby, like me, is
from an oppressed people,

297
00:33:00,747 --> 00:33:03,946
and I need you to put another tonne
on top of that

298
00:33:03,947 --> 00:33:07,986
because his brother is a fucking
animal and he will come after me.

299
00:33:07,987 --> 00:33:11,946
And then you will need to put
another 100 on top of that

300
00:33:11,947 --> 00:33:17,587
because, well, you are a fucking
wop, mate, hmmm?

301
00:33:19,147 --> 00:33:20,627
And you.

302
00:33:21,707 --> 00:33:25,386
And then we've got to deal with the
ugly business,

303
00:33:25,387 --> 00:33:27,787
which I've been incredibly clear of
before.

304
00:33:27,788 --> 00:33:30,066
I will need another £500,

305
00:33:30,067 --> 00:33:32,346
because, like I stated, Tommy Shelby

306
00:33:32,347 --> 00:33:35,267
is a very, very good friend of mine.

307
00:33:36,707 --> 00:33:37,746
Total...

308
00:33:37,747 --> 00:33:41,582
..is down there in black and white,
all right? Crack on.

309
00:33:42,054 --> 00:33:43,134
It's OK.

310
00:33:44,267 --> 00:33:49,147
Mr Solomons, I'm going to be very
fucking clear with you.

311
00:33:50,667 --> 00:33:54,106
I don't need you to kill anybody.

312
00:33:54,107 --> 00:33:56,346
I have people that I trust.

313
00:33:56,347 --> 00:33:58,789
So, you're going to take my boys

314
00:33:58,790 --> 00:34:01,267
and you're going to bring them to
the ring as seconds.

315
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:04,546
Well, in order to qualify as my seconds

316
00:34:04,547 --> 00:34:07,466
they would first have to qualify as
being Jewish.

317
00:34:07,467 --> 00:34:08,586
Yeah?

318
00:34:08,587 --> 00:34:11,586
And in order to do that, they would
have to replace their natural

319
00:34:11,587 --> 00:34:17,546
Italian fucking arrogance with a
Jewish air of absolute certainty.

320
00:34:17,547 --> 00:34:20,747
See, my good friend Thomas Shelby,
he will know the difference.

321
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:28,306
These days, back in the old
country, a lot of the, er, you know,

322
00:34:28,307 --> 00:34:30,147
the Jewish people, they, er...

323
00:34:33,907 --> 00:34:36,587
..they are having to pass themselves
off as Italian.

324
00:34:37,907 --> 00:34:41,746
Right, well, you will have to add
another tonne on to your bill

325
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:43,227
for being a cunt, mate.

326
00:34:44,547 --> 00:34:46,067
All right?

327
00:34:50,786 --> 00:34:55,186
You will bring my men to Birmingham?

328
00:34:57,634 --> 00:34:59,234
You will circumcise them.

329
00:35:00,667 --> 00:35:05,386
You will have to circumcise them
because the Peakys will check.

330
00:35:05,387 --> 00:35:06,427
Yeah?

331
00:35:11,187 --> 00:35:14,746
OK. Any other request, eh?

332
00:35:14,747 --> 00:35:18,347
200 fucking barrels, we have a deal.

333
00:35:20,313 --> 00:35:21,913
Nah.

334
00:35:24,147 --> 00:35:26,746
- What going on?
- Oh, well.

335
00:35:26,747 --> 00:35:28,666
I said we have a deal.

336
00:35:28,667 --> 00:35:31,907
Aye, you've just made a deal
without negotiation, didn't you?

337
00:35:35,987 --> 00:35:38,427
Yeah, Tommy Shelby was right about
you, weren't he?

338
00:35:41,142 --> 00:35:44,800
_

339
00:36:09,827 --> 00:36:10,987
Ada Shelby?

340
00:36:12,034 --> 00:36:13,074
No.

341
00:36:36,307 --> 00:36:39,226
She was armed when we picked her
up, sir, so we strip searched her.

342
00:36:39,227 --> 00:36:41,546
- That'll be all.
- Yes, sir.

343
00:36:41,547 --> 00:36:44,106
I apologise, Miss Shelby,

344
00:36:44,107 --> 00:36:47,907
the Territorials can be over zealous.

345
00:36:48,947 --> 00:36:50,426
Your men watched.

346
00:36:50,427 --> 00:36:52,066
Then they will be reprimanded.

347
00:36:52,067 --> 00:36:53,511
They won't see Saturday.

348
00:36:54,987 --> 00:36:59,426
A naked woman, alone, making threats
against the entire British Army -

349
00:36:59,427 --> 00:37:01,667
a significant indicator of character.

350
00:37:05,707 --> 00:37:08,707
I'll turn my back while you dress
and perhaps we can talk.

351
00:37:11,507 --> 00:37:14,387
I have a dossier on each member of
your family.

352
00:37:15,387 --> 00:37:17,706
I know your family's extraordinary
history.

353
00:37:17,707 --> 00:37:19,506
Ah, fuck you.

354
00:37:19,507 --> 00:37:21,706
I also have a totally blank page
on which together

355
00:37:21,707 --> 00:37:24,027
we can write your family's immediate
future.

356
00:37:25,187 --> 00:37:26,946
You rehearsed your speech -

357
00:37:26,947 --> 00:37:29,946
significant indicator of a lack of
confidence.

358
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:33,266
What rank are you?
Colonel. May I turn...?

359
00:37:33,267 --> 00:37:35,866
Not unless you want to get blinded.

360
00:37:35,867 --> 00:37:38,387
I'm sorry. This has got off to a
bad start.

361
00:37:39,667 --> 00:37:41,066
What is "this"?

362
00:37:41,067 --> 00:37:43,026
Three days ago you were seen at a meeting

363
00:37:43,027 --> 00:37:45,026
for the Stetchford Communist Party.

364
00:37:45,027 --> 00:37:47,867
You were then seen talking to a
woman called Jessie Eden.

365
00:37:48,907 --> 00:37:49,947
Turn around.

366
00:37:56,347 --> 00:37:57,627
I'm leaving.

367
00:37:59,827 --> 00:38:03,191
And you can burn this. It's history.

368
00:38:05,867 --> 00:38:07,866
Ada Shelby.

369
00:38:07,867 --> 00:38:11,906
A person of interest and under the
surveillance of Special Branch

370
00:38:11,907 --> 00:38:15,827
since you joined the Birmingham
Communist Party in June 1919.

371
00:38:16,547 --> 00:38:19,466
I'm no longer a member of the
Communist Party.

372
00:38:19,467 --> 00:38:21,347
I know. Irrelevant.

373
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,226
Most of the more active subversives

374
00:38:24,227 --> 00:38:26,987
shed their official allegiances to
avoid detection.

375
00:38:27,987 --> 00:38:30,826
Look, OK, let me explain it to you.

376
00:38:30,827 --> 00:38:33,706
I'm no longer a member of the
Communist Party

377
00:38:33,707 --> 00:38:36,426
because I'm no longer a believer in
the cause of socialism.

378
00:38:36,427 --> 00:38:38,186
Now, open that door!

379
00:38:38,187 --> 00:38:41,987
So, in the past, you were blinded
by love.

380
00:38:44,206 --> 00:38:50,926
No, blinded by faith. I believed
people deserve justice. They don't.

381
00:38:52,067 --> 00:38:56,386
So, you've arrested me because I had
a drink with Jessie Eden.

382
00:38:56,387 --> 00:39:00,027
Whisky with ice for you, and a
beer for her.

383
00:39:03,547 --> 00:39:06,961
I met Jessie Eden to settle an
industrial dispute.

384
00:39:07,787 --> 00:39:11,066
Head of acquisitions. So, you've
swapped sides.

385
00:39:11,067 --> 00:39:13,630
If you know what I drink, you know
what I do for a living.

386
00:39:14,707 --> 00:39:20,146
Mrs Shelby, you must understand
that these are extraordinary times.

387
00:39:20,147 --> 00:39:24,186
A general strike is certain, an
attempted revolution perhaps,

388
00:39:24,187 --> 00:39:26,506
soldiers on the streets very soon.

389
00:39:26,507 --> 00:39:27,667
They're already drilling.

390
00:39:28,827 --> 00:39:33,907
And here stands you, a woman with
her foot in both camps.

391
00:39:34,947 --> 00:39:36,307
Potentially very useful.

392
00:39:37,707 --> 00:39:39,067
Useful to who?

393
00:39:40,867 --> 00:39:43,067
Maybe you should ask your brother,
Thomas.

394
00:39:58,947 --> 00:40:00,706
Put some fucking effort into it, son.

395
00:40:00,707 --> 00:40:02,387
The fight is in two days.

396
00:40:04,387 --> 00:40:05,786
Get used to the reach.

397
00:40:05,787 --> 00:40:08,507
Get used to the long arm on him.

398
00:40:11,387 --> 00:40:12,907
Just get under it!

399
00:40:15,747 --> 00:40:17,267
That's it, under his body.

400
00:40:28,867 --> 00:40:31,226
Talk to me about Colonel Ben Younger.

401
00:40:35,027 --> 00:40:36,866
What about him?

402
00:40:37,053 --> 00:40:39,013
He's just made me a proposition.

403
00:40:42,907 --> 00:40:45,506
You're in my chair.

404
00:40:45,874 --> 00:40:47,794
He said you knew about it.

405
00:40:48,907 --> 00:40:51,546
And, remember, I know when you're lying.

406
00:40:51,547 --> 00:40:53,506
Ben Younger was an officer

407
00:40:53,747 --> 00:40:57,187
with the Warwickshire Yeomanry in
Flanders.

408
00:40:59,827 --> 00:41:02,826
The only cavalryman who could ride a
fucking horse.

409
00:41:02,827 --> 00:41:04,667
I was strip searched.

410
00:41:07,827 --> 00:41:09,587
Two soldiers watched.

411
00:41:11,387 --> 00:41:13,387
I'm sorry, Ada.

412
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:21,986
The arrest was so the neighbours
would see and word would go round.

413
00:41:22,413 --> 00:41:23,813
Younger is all right.

414
00:41:27,867 --> 00:41:30,067
Younger came to me for help.

415
00:41:33,747 --> 00:41:36,186
He's been given Birmingham.

416
00:41:36,187 --> 00:41:37,587
"Given Birmingham" by who?

417
00:41:38,987 --> 00:41:43,026
By Churchill, by the fucking King,

418
00:41:43,027 --> 00:41:46,706
by people who want to stop a revolution.

419
00:41:46,707 --> 00:41:48,427
No-one's laughing any more, Ada.

420
00:41:50,267 --> 00:41:52,587
The Home Office is making provisions.

421
00:41:53,787 --> 00:41:55,507
This is part of those provisions.

422
00:41:56,907 --> 00:42:00,867
And how is Tommy Shelby OBE going
to stop a revolution?

423
00:42:02,067 --> 00:42:04,586
Jessie Eden has accepted my
invitation to dinner.

424
00:42:04,587 --> 00:42:06,466
Ah. Of course!

425
00:42:06,467 --> 00:42:10,507
I'm sorry, Tommy Shelby is going to
stop the revolution with his cock!

426
00:42:12,507 --> 00:42:14,706
It's not her the military are
interested in,

427
00:42:14,707 --> 00:42:16,866
it's the people around her.

428
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:20,907
They're people like you used to be,
like Freddie used to be.

429
00:42:21,987 --> 00:42:23,867
People who want an armed revolution.

430
00:42:25,947 --> 00:42:27,747
If I get Jessie Eden's trust...

431
00:42:28,867 --> 00:42:30,947
..she gives me the nose of the
instigators...

432
00:42:32,307 --> 00:42:34,666
..I give 'em up to the Crown forces.

433
00:42:34,667 --> 00:42:37,027
Tommy, Tommy, sweetheart...

434
00:42:38,267 --> 00:42:39,906
..why would a man whose medals rust

435
00:42:39,907 --> 00:42:43,347
at the bottom of the Saltley canal
want to help the British military?

436
00:42:48,107 --> 00:42:53,234
Because I've been offered three
five-year contracts

437
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:57,066
to supply military vehicles
to the British forces

438
00:42:57,067 --> 00:43:00,986
in India, Ceylon, Singapore and Burma,

439
00:43:00,987 --> 00:43:03,627
total value - £2 million.

440
00:43:06,987 --> 00:43:08,706
And there'll be no strikes in your
factory

441
00:43:08,707 --> 00:43:10,707
because Jessie Eden will be in your bed.

442
00:43:14,387 --> 00:43:16,906
Tommy, this can only happen if
you're still alive.

443
00:43:16,907 --> 00:43:18,667
I'm planning on staying alive.

444
00:43:20,147 --> 00:43:23,467
If I'm dead, you can all go back to
being what you were.

445
00:43:26,587 --> 00:43:29,860
The British Army came to me, Ada.

446
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,360
I said, "Why not?"

447
00:43:37,307 --> 00:43:39,147
They'll put that on your grave, Tom.

448
00:43:41,467 --> 00:43:44,627
'Tommy Shelby - "Why not?"'

449
00:43:49,067 --> 00:43:50,787
Are you going to help me or not?

450
00:44:13,206 --> 00:44:14,566
Other way round.

451
00:44:23,067 --> 00:44:24,626
Will they want music, Charlie?

452
00:44:24,627 --> 00:44:25,746
We have that gramophone

453
00:44:25,747 --> 00:44:28,466
we found abandoned inside that
gentleman's car.

454
00:44:28,467 --> 00:44:31,466
No, they don't. Tommy said they're
here to talk.

455
00:44:40,907 --> 00:44:43,147
Charlie, Curly, this is Jessie Eden.

456
00:44:44,667 --> 00:44:49,426
Jessie, this is my Uncle Charlie and
my... whatever Curly is.

457
00:44:49,427 --> 00:44:50,786
This is actually lovely.

458
00:44:50,787 --> 00:44:53,066
We were just wondering if you'd
like some music.

459
00:44:53,067 --> 00:44:55,826
- No, we weren't.
- Actually, Jessie likes music.

460
00:44:55,827 --> 00:44:57,066
Don't go to any trouble.

461
00:44:57,067 --> 00:44:59,147
No, Curly, go to some trouble.

462
00:45:00,587 --> 00:45:01,867
Go on, then.

463
00:45:08,587 --> 00:45:09,827
Right...

464
00:45:28,107 --> 00:45:29,706
Don't I get a choice?

465
00:45:29,707 --> 00:45:32,147
I want an opinion. Try it.

466
00:45:39,307 --> 00:45:40,826
I don't really drink gin.

467
00:45:40,827 --> 00:45:42,346
Then you're perfect.

468
00:45:42,347 --> 00:45:44,626
My gin is for women that don't
really drink gin.

469
00:45:44,627 --> 00:45:45,986
Your gin?

470
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:49,627
Let's drink to something. You choose.

471
00:45:52,307 --> 00:45:53,667
To the revolution.

472
00:45:55,787 --> 00:45:58,386
Why not?

473
00:45:58,387 --> 00:46:00,418
- To the revolution.
- The revolution.

474
00:46:02,907 --> 00:46:06,107
Right, well, since I invited you for
dinner, I thought I'd cook.

475
00:46:07,387 --> 00:46:10,226
These two beauties were shot this morning

476
00:46:10,227 --> 00:46:14,506
by a poacher friend of mine on Lord
Packwood's estate.

477
00:46:14,507 --> 00:46:16,146
I thought you'd like that.

478
00:46:16,147 --> 00:46:21,519
And these here, these were stolen
from under his trees.

479
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,626
Mr Shelby...

480
00:46:26,627 --> 00:46:28,586
..I came to talk business.

481
00:46:28,587 --> 00:46:31,347
Yes, so did I.

482
00:46:36,867 --> 00:46:38,826
Wage cuts withdrawn,

483
00:46:38,827 --> 00:46:41,426
parity between men and women guaranteed.

484
00:46:41,427 --> 00:46:44,487
You can instruct your members to
return to work tomorrow.

485
00:46:46,507 --> 00:46:47,786
And all I have to do in return

486
00:46:47,787 --> 00:46:50,147
is tell you everything I know about
socialism.

487
00:46:51,147 --> 00:46:52,667
That's what your sister said.

488
00:46:54,467 --> 00:46:55,987
You don't like your gin?

489
00:46:57,547 --> 00:46:58,787
It's OK.

490
00:47:00,387 --> 00:47:01,867
It's OK?

491
00:47:04,307 --> 00:47:06,507
What do you want to know about the cause?

492
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:13,346
I'm approaching the current
political crisis

493
00:47:13,347 --> 00:47:15,827
as I would approach a horse race...

494
00:47:18,307 --> 00:47:20,587
..assessing the runners and the riders.

495
00:47:23,747 --> 00:47:27,386
Now, the favourite is, of course,
the King's horse.

496
00:47:29,283 --> 00:47:32,066
But the King's horse was also the
favourite in 1913,

497
00:47:32,067 --> 00:47:35,106
when Emily Davison threw herself in
front of it.

498
00:47:35,107 --> 00:47:39,906
You know the names of
suffragettes. I'm impressed.

499
00:47:39,907 --> 00:47:43,106
Everyone laughed at them at first,
but now look -

500
00:47:43,107 --> 00:47:45,427
women with serious faces everywhere.

501
00:47:48,707 --> 00:47:52,066
When I study a horse race, I study form.

502
00:47:52,067 --> 00:47:53,506
And then the other horse,

503
00:47:53,507 --> 00:47:55,907
the one who wants to beat
the King's horse...

504
00:47:58,387 --> 00:48:00,706
Let's call her Dangerous, shall we?

505
00:48:00,707 --> 00:48:02,866
..she's no form.

506
00:48:02,867 --> 00:48:04,426
That's what makes her so dangerous.

507
00:48:04,427 --> 00:48:08,186
Russia. Isn't that form?

508
00:48:08,187 --> 00:48:11,747
No, the Russians aren't like the
English. We're beer, they're petrol.

509
00:48:13,307 --> 00:48:15,469
That's why I invited you here for dinner.

510
00:48:16,994 --> 00:48:18,707
I'm guessing you know people...

511
00:48:20,467 --> 00:48:22,786
..people that want to make this
fight real,

512
00:48:22,787 --> 00:48:24,267
with guns and ammunition.

513
00:48:25,867 --> 00:48:28,866
So, before I place a bet on who's
going to win,

514
00:48:29,288 --> 00:48:30,907
I need to know how strong they are...

515
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:32,920
..how serious they are.

516
00:48:34,787 --> 00:48:38,107
Your concern is that if the
unthinkable happened...

517
00:48:39,267 --> 00:48:42,307
..you would find yourself on the
wrong side of the barricades.

518
00:48:43,427 --> 00:48:46,146
Well, as you can see,

519
00:48:46,147 --> 00:48:49,346
my natural side of the barricades is
the same as yours.

520
00:48:49,347 --> 00:48:50,617
And, as you know,

521
00:48:52,350 --> 00:48:53,864
I once believed.

522
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:56,707
But the war changed you.

523
00:48:58,867 --> 00:48:59,907
Yeah.

524
00:49:03,747 --> 00:49:06,107
The man I loved couldn't speak
when he got back.

525
00:49:07,107 --> 00:49:08,147
Not one word.

526
00:49:11,067 --> 00:49:12,907
I've said very few true words since.

527
00:49:15,387 --> 00:49:17,987
The men who blew the whistles in
France are our enemy.

528
00:49:20,267 --> 00:49:23,106
And you count yourself among those
who want a real fight?

529
00:49:23,665 --> 00:49:24,906
I do.

530
00:49:25,679 --> 00:49:26,746
Well, well.

531
00:49:26,747 --> 00:49:29,827
Yes. Not just in my dreams, in the
day now.

532
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:33,180
And you're not alone.

533
00:49:34,427 --> 00:49:35,507
I am not alone.

534
00:49:37,387 --> 00:49:39,507
Well, well.

535
00:49:41,187 --> 00:49:42,621
I have researched you.

536
00:49:43,768 --> 00:49:45,851
We have researched you.

537
00:49:47,816 --> 00:49:49,946
You have never been a friend of the
Government.

538
00:49:50,633 --> 00:49:52,353
They have used you.

539
00:49:52,947 --> 00:49:55,186
And I imagine you have found out already

540
00:49:55,187 --> 00:49:58,066
that no amount of money allows you
to pass through the steel sheets

541
00:49:58,067 --> 00:50:00,107
that separate class from class.

542
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:03,908
Yes.

543
00:50:05,396 --> 00:50:07,260
Yes, that I have learnt.

544
00:50:08,707 --> 00:50:11,266
Men like you would terrify them -

545
00:50:11,667 --> 00:50:13,667
a man better than them at what they do.

546
00:50:16,187 --> 00:50:18,787
Would I change the odds, do you think?

547
00:50:23,311 --> 00:50:25,186
It's all wound up, Tom.

548
00:50:25,187 --> 00:50:28,586
Er, you just put the needle on and
let it spin.

549
00:50:28,587 --> 00:50:30,306
And there are some popular records.

550
00:50:30,307 --> 00:50:32,067
Mostly romantic.

551
00:50:33,987 --> 00:50:35,027
Thank you, Curly.

552
00:50:42,627 --> 00:50:43,787
Food's nearly ready.

553
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,820
Let's eat before we dance, shall we?

554
00:50:49,027 --> 00:50:50,267
So we're going to dance?

555
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:53,960
I think so.

556
00:51:05,707 --> 00:51:07,466
I swear to God.

557
00:51:07,467 --> 00:51:09,506
She gave me sixpence and she sends
me to the shop

558
00:51:09,507 --> 00:51:12,866
for margarine, eggs and bread.

559
00:51:12,867 --> 00:51:14,106
And I came back...

560
00:51:14,107 --> 00:51:15,906
With a top hat and a coconut?

561
00:51:15,907 --> 00:51:19,586
That was all our money we had for
the whole fucking week

562
00:51:19,587 --> 00:51:22,666
and my mum beat me with a fucking
frying pan.

563
00:51:22,667 --> 00:51:25,026
Why the hell did you buy a top hat
and a coconut?

564
00:51:25,027 --> 00:51:28,692
Cos I thought she deserved it. I
thought we all did.

565
00:51:28,693 --> 00:51:30,902
And I could never understand

566
00:51:32,182 --> 00:51:34,386
why people like us

567
00:51:34,387 --> 00:51:36,227
only had bread and fucking lard...

568
00:51:38,027 --> 00:51:41,987
..and I wanted to be different.
That's what I wanted.

569
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:46,200
And you are.

570
00:51:48,027 --> 00:51:49,147
Well...

571
00:51:51,307 --> 00:51:55,467
When I showed you that photo of
Greta Jurossi, your face changed.

572
00:51:59,467 --> 00:52:02,586
She wanted everything to be different -

573
00:52:03,100 --> 00:52:04,500
the whole world.

574
00:52:05,427 --> 00:52:06,827
As do I.

575
00:52:11,507 --> 00:52:12,867
Shall we have some more music?

576
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:22,260
You were married but she was killed.

577
00:52:26,827 --> 00:52:29,907
Bye-bye Blackbird reminds you of
your sweetheart, eh?

578
00:52:31,027 --> 00:52:32,067
Yes.

579
00:52:33,667 --> 00:52:35,626
Right, fast or slow?

580
00:52:35,627 --> 00:52:37,826
Better be slow. I'd better just sit.

581
00:52:37,827 --> 00:52:38,867
I'm drunk.

582
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:45,500
Come on.

583
00:53:10,147 --> 00:53:11,547
Will you help us, Tommy?

584
00:53:50,707 --> 00:53:53,747
Soon. Soon.

585
00:53:58,507 --> 00:54:02,946
Arrange a meeting with the
appropriate people

586
00:54:03,834 --> 00:54:05,514
and I'll be there.

587
00:54:16,694 --> 00:54:21,648
Vinny, come on, boy. Get over
here, you lazy bastard!

588
00:54:21,649 --> 00:54:23,347
Here, want some of that?

589
00:54:26,907 --> 00:54:29,146
The, er, room is clean, Mr Shelby.

590
00:54:29,147 --> 00:54:31,507
Right. Lock it all down.

591
00:54:32,827 --> 00:54:34,707
All right, boys, lock it down.

592
00:54:42,947 --> 00:54:46,747
No weapons! No admission if you've
any weapon.

593
00:54:52,867 --> 00:54:53,947
Go on!

594
00:54:57,427 --> 00:54:58,907
Arthur!

595
00:55:00,067 --> 00:55:03,027
Can I open the book?
Right, open it up. You!

596
00:55:09,473 --> 00:55:11,072
Gentlemen.

597
00:55:11,267 --> 00:55:14,546
Now, you listen to me, you put all
your money on the gold, you hear me?

598
00:55:14,547 --> 00:55:16,467
It's fucking fight night.

599
00:55:21,707 --> 00:55:27,786
Come on, boys, and place your bets
with me, Honest Johnny Dogs.

600
00:55:27,787 --> 00:55:33,626
The only show in town, by order of
our special constable brothers,

601
00:55:33,627 --> 00:55:37,027
the Peaky fucking Blinders.

602
00:55:51,587 --> 00:55:57,226
Bonnie boy. Here we go, boy. Bring
out that fucking tiger.

603
00:55:57,227 --> 00:55:58,546
Go on.

604
00:55:58,547 --> 00:56:00,186
Tiger's already out.

605
00:56:00,187 --> 00:56:01,427
Fair enough.

606
00:56:02,707 --> 00:56:04,026
Bonnie.

607
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:06,146
Mr Shelby will give you a 20% cut

608
00:56:06,147 --> 00:56:08,346
if you put Goliath down in the
fourth round.

609
00:56:08,347 --> 00:56:10,987
Been caged up too long, brother.

610
00:56:13,827 --> 00:56:16,260
If the women are going to have fun,
so am I.
