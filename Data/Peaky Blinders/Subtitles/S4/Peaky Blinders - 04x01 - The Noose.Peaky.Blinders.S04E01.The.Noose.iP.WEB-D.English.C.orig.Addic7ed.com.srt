1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:06,280
This programme contains
some violent scenes and
strong language from the start.

2
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:08,880
Arthur.

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:09,920
John.

4
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,360
Michael.

5
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:17,800
The Chief Constable of Birmingham

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:20,920
has issued a warrant
for your arrest.

7
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,280
I've made a deal with people
even more powerful than our enemies.

8
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:39,040
Trust me, brother.

9
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,440
Father.

10
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:04,040
What is it - Sunday?

11
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,800
There's been a mistake.

12
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:08,760
There's an appeal process underway
that doesn't begin until January.

13
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:10,920
I want to see my lawyer, Mr Patrick.

14
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:13,680
Stop! This shouldn't be happening!

15
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,720
Get your hands off me!

16
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,000
Argh! Get your hands off me,
you bastards!

17
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:34,760
I'm John Shelby!

18
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:45,280
When I come back...when
I come back, got to be clear.

19
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,440
Want to go outside.
Want to go outside.

20
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,880
Want to go outside.
Want to go outside.

21
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,080
Michael! Michael!

22
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,080
Arthur! Michael! Arthur!

23
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,040
John! Where's Tommy?!
Arthur!

24
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,520
Arthur! JOHN!

25
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,360
No!

26
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,320
Arthur, you have to call the King!

27
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,960
About what? About this!

28
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,880
This is the case of a family
of Birmingham gangsters

29
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:02,240
on trial for murder and sedition.

30
00:03:02,240 --> 00:03:04,400
Why would the King intervene?

31
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,880
The leader of the gang,
Thomas Shelby.

32
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,480
He claims his family was caught up
in a wider conspiracy.

33
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:12,320
He names Winston Churchill.
You woke me up for this?

34
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:14,720
And he also sent us this.

35
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,360
How the fuck did
a Birmingham racketeer

36
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:24,920
get his hands on a personal letter
written by King George?

37
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,480
During a robbery at Hampton Court,

38
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,880
Shelby discovered
a box of correspondence.

39
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:32,360
Among the papers he stole was
that letter from the King himself,

40
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,360
which proves
His Majesty was involved.

41
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,360
Oh, utter fuck.

42
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,120
If his family walks free, then he
will burn the papers in my presence.

43
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,440
When are they due to hang? Today.

44
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,760
This morning,
in Winson Green Prison.

45
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,960
Why the hell didn't you
bring it up before?!

46
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,960
The plan was for
the Lord Chamberlain

47
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,400
to intervene at the appeal
but late last night

48
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,600
some local judge brought
the executions forward.

49
00:03:58,600 --> 00:04:00,160
Oh, my giddy aunt!

50
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,880
Put me through to His Majesty.

51
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,360
Well, wake him up!

52
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,200
In the bleak midwinter.

53
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:23,640
In the bleak midwinter.

54
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,240
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done

55
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,880
on earth as it is...

56
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,240
Oh, Lord Jesus,

57
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:32,280
with this rope,
pull me up to heaven.

58
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,560
I see your face shining down on me!

59
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,280
Wait!

60
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,480
Wait!

61
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,040
Also, sir, in return for
burning the King's letters,

62
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:23,640
Thomas Shelby has asked
for something else.

63
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:26,840
An inclusion in this year's
New Year's honours list.

64
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,280
Thomas Shelby has asked for
the King to award him an OBE, sir.

65
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,240
God bless. Merry Christmas!

66
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,560
Not going home for Christmas,
Mr Shelby?

67
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,640
Tomorrow.

68
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:50,320
So...Maria, or Clara, or Elizabeth?

69
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,440
It's Christmas.

70
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:56,080
Someone new, Billy.

71
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,680
I've wrapped all Charlie's presents
and left them in the room.

72
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,920
What did I get him?

73
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,640
Toy horses, toy cars, toy guns.

74
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,880
You're due at the Singer factory
at 8:00 tomorrow, not 8:30.

75
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,760
There's an union problem.

76
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:18,960
8:00. Yep.

77
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,280
Then the driver will take you home.

78
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,800
I'll drive myself.

79
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,720
Good night, Lizzie.
Have a good Christmas.

80
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,200
I'll have a vodka tonic. Yes, ma'am.

81
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,400
Tommy, I've had Christmas cards

82
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:41,600
from John, Arthur,
Ada, Michael and Polly.

83
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,600
And an invitation.

84
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,480
New Year's.

85
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,480
A party at John's house.

86
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,880
A party at John's big house.
Good for him.

87
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,760
Ada's coming back
from Boston for it.

88
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,600
I know.

89
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:01,680
It was me who gave her the time off.

90
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,960
Why don't you come?
Just turn up. Bring Charlie.

91
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,240
Bring a lump of coal. First footing.

92
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:17,560
A dark-haired man crosses
the threshold to bring good luck
for the new year. Hm?

93
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:21,200
The babies will make everybody OK.
Babies stop everything.

94
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,000
You can't pull a razor with
a baby there. Not even Esme.

95
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:32,520
Just come. See what happens.

96
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,600
Tommy, you've never even
seen Arthur's kid.

97
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,600
Nor John and Esme's.

98
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:44,720
Your drink, madam. Thank you.

99
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,360
Billy?

100
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,840
Who did you get for me?

101
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,120
Theresa. I said someone new.

102
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,640
Understood.

103
00:09:03,560 --> 00:09:04,960
Do it for Charlie!

104
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,920
Charlie should know his cousins.

105
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,320
I got Charlie a real horse, Lizzie.

106
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,720
Not a toy. A thoroughbred.

107
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,400
And on Christmas Day,
it'll be just you and Charlie.

108
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,600
And the horse.

109
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:29,200
You can't live like this
another year.

110
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,200
Sex, freedom, whisky sours.

111
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,400
Which one should I give up first,
Lizzie, eh?

112
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:50,240
I've got you something.

113
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:02,760
Merry Christmas.

114
00:10:57,880 --> 00:11:00,360
I told you, you didn't need to come
on Christmas Eve.

115
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,560
I could have dealt with it.

116
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,600
Yeah? Like you dealt with it
at the Pressings factory(!)

117
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,880
Well, this is the same problem.

118
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:10,640
Same fucking union convenor.

119
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,960
Area convenor for the Boilermakers'
Union has got involved in something

120
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:17,080
that could have otherwise been fixed
with a drink and a bribe.

121
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,280
The wire-cutting shop? Yeah.

122
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,080
Now, all the wire-cutters
here are women.

123
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:23,680
That's why the union convenor
thinks they're being underpaid.

124
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,720
Well, tell him there are no men
in the cutting shops,

125
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,360
so there can be no comparatives.

126
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,040
It's a woman. What is?

127
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,280
The union convenor
causing all the trouble.

128
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,080
Fuck! Her name's Jessie Eden.

129
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,080
You heard of her? Yeah.

130
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,000
Do you want me in the meeting?

131
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,560
No.

132
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,480
Michael?

133
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,400
Look...sometimes I have
a sniff of snow, so what?

134
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,040
How's your mother?

135
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,160
I drove past her house.
The drainpipe was hanging off.

136
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,400
Look, the cocaine keeps me awake.

137
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:28,160
Very long hours these days,
and when I do sleep,

138
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,440
I dream about what happened.

139
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,640
I wasn't asking
about you, Michael, was I?

140
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,400
I was asking about your mother.

141
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,000
Since she was pardoned,
she's been on these fucking tablets

142
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:43,160
the doctor gave her
when she was in the prison.

143
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:47,400
She says that when she was
inside the noose...she saw spirits.

144
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:51,120
She's running seances,

145
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,280
but people just come into
the house to steal things.

146
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,760
Tommy, it's bad.
All right, all right.

147
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,760
Hm! Now, listen to me, Michael...

148
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:12,000
..the spirits she sees are real.

149
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:15,600
Believe they're real.

150
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,400
Believe it with her.

151
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,360
Then eventually...

152
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,440
you can take the remembered noose
from around her neck...

153
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,320
..like a horse that's
been choked off.

154
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,160
Keep her off whisky,
throw away the tablets...

155
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,920
..and stop giving her fucking snow.

156
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,440
Fuck, Tommy, that sounded like
family advice.

157
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,920
Are you coming back?

158
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,040
Nothing to come back to.

159
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,440
Truth is, they're all fucked.

160
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:54,520
The lot of them. Yeah.

161
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,600
Find out about that woman,
Jessie Eden.

162
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,280
Don't let your mother keep cash
in the house. And, oi!

163
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,360
No cocaine
in my registered premises.

164
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:04,160
Did you see they all came?

165
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,880
Yeah, I saw you at the back.

166
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:12,120
It's funny they don't notice.

167
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,160
Oh, my sweet!

168
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,120
Oh, my heart!

169
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,880
Crushed to death in the canal.

170
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:33,920
But back home again,
and so beautiful!

171
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:44,200
Oh!

172
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,880
Inside the loop.

173
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:00,400
Inside the merry loop.

174
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,520
For fuck's sake!

175
00:16:41,760 --> 00:16:43,280
Fucking birds!

176
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,120
Ada.

177
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,360
Come on.

178
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:06,120
I thought we'd lost you to
the great white way of Broadway.

179
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:09,560
No. Well, this beats
Watery Lane, John.

180
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:12,640
Does it?
Take a seat, I'll grab the kids.

181
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,840
Oh, it's all right,
I'm not stopping.

182
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:18,240
I just want to drop those presents
off for tomorrow.

183
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:20,440
I don't want words on Christmas Eve.

184
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,200
It's my house. You're welcome.

185
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,120
It's OK, I'm staying with Polly.

186
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:30,160
Yeah. She's in a bad way.

187
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,920
Mm. I'll bring her to her senses.

188
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,600
Michael's already tried that.
I'll get through to her.

189
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:41,000
You still going to come to
the party on New Year's Eve?

190
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,840
Yeah. Who else is coming?

191
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,360
Arthur, Linda...

192
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:48,080
Hello, Esme.

193
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,080
Who paid for your car and driver,
Ada?

194
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,360
Shelby Company Limited.

195
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,920
Nice car. He treats you well.

196
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,760
His last little pet.

197
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:04,120
Look, this visit is meant to be
about making things all right.

198
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,840
John had a rope around his neck.
He shit himself.

199
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:10,480
All right, Esme, that'll do, yeah?
Go in the kitchen.

200
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,640
Take a curse back to the money.

201
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,600
Anyway, there's your presents.

202
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,240
How's Arthur?

203
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:28,200
For Christmas,
get him a sewing kit...

204
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,520
..so he can sew
his fucking balls back on.

205
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,360
Oh!

206
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:13,200
Maypole 245.

207
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,800
Hello, Esme.

208
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:22,840
There you go, look. That's a couple
of eggs. Two eggs. There we go.

209
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,680
Arthur?

210
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,120
Be careful with Billy in there,
there's a cock.

211
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,960
Yeah, I will.

212
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,160
And don't smoke that near him.

213
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,200
All right. Get out of it!

214
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,400
Esme called to say
Ada's on her way over.

215
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,360
Did you hear that, Billy boy?

216
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:43,440
Your Auntie Ada's coming
all the way from America.

217
00:19:44,840 --> 00:19:46,960
Bye, chickens!

218
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,120
Oh! We dropped an egg, look!

219
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,640
We dropped an egg, Billy boy.

220
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:56,440
Red Right Hand
by FIDLAR

221
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,280
Give him the hell he gives us,
Miss Eden.

222
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:29,040
Excuse me! This is the gents...

223
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:31,280
You don't have a women's lavatory
on the second floor

224
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,280
because no women get this far up.

225
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,600
If you don't have a women's
lavatory, I can't go to it, can I?

226
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:01,000
You say there is a disparity in pay
based on sex.

227
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,160
The male wire-cutters
in the Rover factory

228
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:08,640
a mile and a half down the road

229
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,440
are paid ten shillings a week more

230
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,880
than the female wire-cutters here.

231
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,760
Different factories,
different rates.

232
00:21:15,760 --> 00:21:18,760
But both factories
are owned by you, Mr Shelby.

233
00:21:18,760 --> 00:21:20,280
Not in your own name, of course.

234
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,000
In the name of Arrow House Holdings.

235
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,200
You own the Lanchester
car and van factory

236
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:27,280
in the name
of Tilton Company Limited,

237
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:30,280
the Billings machine tools factories
at Hay Mills and Greet

238
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,160
in the name of
Stetchford Engineering,

239
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:35,320
the Bilston Forgings and Pressings
factory in the name of Canalside,

240
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:37,480
and the canal warehousing
in Gas Street,

241
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:40,360
Saltely and Cadbury in the name
of Shelby Company Limited.

242
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,120
Also, 255 streets
of back-to-back houses.

243
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,360
Very good.

244
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,240
Very good.

245
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,080
So this isn't about women and men.

246
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,760
It's about me, eh?

247
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:59,920
Tommy Shelby, OBE.
No, it's not about you.

248
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,600
It's about disparities.

249
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,360
It's about ten shillings a week
for working mothers

250
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,080
so they can buy shoes for their
kids. Never had shoes myself.

251
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:09,920
So, now you deny others?

252
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:12,560
And, barefoot, I grew up mean.

253
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,160
Oh, I know.
Oh, yeah, you know everything.

254
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,880
Your turn of phrase...
Is unacceptable?

255
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,800
You grew up mean, you say? A threat
in there, I think, somewhere.

256
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,720
No threats. The whole of
Birmingham knows you, Mr Shelby.

257
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,080
Sweetheart...whatever you've heard,
I don't need to make threats.

258
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,440
My comrade brothers and sisters...

259
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,120
Huh! Your brothers and sisters!
All right, listen,

260
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:38,360
I will conduct myself
as a businessman...

261
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,040
Who says "sweetheart"!

262
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,080
You say there is
a ten-shilling disparity

263
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,040
between male and female cutters
in two of my factories?

264
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:46,520
Very well.

265
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,400
I will increase the pay of
the female cutters

266
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,040
in this factory by five shillings.

267
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,800
And I will cut the pay

268
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:58,240
of the male cutters in the Rover
by five shillings...

269
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:02,560
..thereby achieving
your sacred fucking parity.

270
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:07,400
And I will tell the men
with families to feed

271
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,120
whose idea it was to cut their pay.

272
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:13,320
You do that, I will bring
all my members out on strike.

273
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:16,840
Oh, yeah? The week after Christmas?
You think so?

274
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,760
You know, everything
you've said here today,

275
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,120
and the fact that we're having
this meeting today

276
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:24,520
tells me that you are
a woman without a family.

277
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:26,400
And everything I hear about you

278
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,760
tells me you are a man
without a family, as well.

279
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:34,400
My comrade brothers and sisters
are not afraid of you, Mr Shelby.

280
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,520
I will call an extraordinary meeting
of my executive committee

281
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,400
as soon as Boxing Day.

282
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,160
You will hear the whistles blow
all across Birmingham.

283
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:47,400
I've heard lots of whistles blow,
sweetheart!

284
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:14,280
The post has arrived, Mr Shelby.

285
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:22,840
I'm sorry to keep asking,

286
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:24,920
but Chef needs to know
how many for dinner tomorrow.

287
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:29,240
He's new. He's foreign.
He gets very upset.

288
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,280
Right. Well, you tell Chef

289
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:35,800
there'll be 27 guests
for Christmas dinner tomorrow.

290
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,160
27? Family?

291
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:41,120
Yep. I thought Charlie
could do with some company,

292
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:44,200
so I asked Johnny Dogs if he knew
anyone who liked to eat goose...

293
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,920
..and he said he knew 26.

294
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,160
Tell Chef I want ten geese,

295
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,440
a buck cut into steaks,

296
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,440
some trout from the river.

297
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,880
Fetch whisky, brandy and wine
from the cellar. Best we have.

298
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:02,160
There will be children?

299
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,240
Lots of children.

300
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,760
With Johnny's tribe, new ones
might be born on the floor.

301
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,520
So have mops and buckets ready, eh?

302
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,240
And I want you at the table,
Frances, so make it 28.

303
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:17,320
I will be busy.

304
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:19,480
You've put up with me
this past year,

305
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,640
looked after Charlie
when I've been on business.

306
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,840
Tomorrow, you will eat at my table.

307
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,760
Things will get better, I think,
next year.

308
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:34,240
It gets much warmer
than here in the summer.

309
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:36,680
Much colder in the winter.
I knew it. Mm.

310
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,800
But parts of it are
just like Birmingham.

311
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,000
Yeah. Shit and smoke
are the same everywhere.

312
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,240
Hm. What about you, Linda?
Are you working?

313
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:48,840
I've been seeking work as a teacher.
A teacher.

314
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:51,200
But, you know, it's quite difficult.

315
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,840
The Shelby name,
it's always in the papers.

316
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,720
And, er...what do you
get up to all day, Arthur?

317
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,600
As you know,
Arthur's previous endeavours

318
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,280
have left us with
no need for a salary.

319
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,240
Arthur occupies his time in
the garden, doing voluntary work.

320
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,880
He drives old people and cripples.

321
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,840
Oh. Yeah, well,
it's something to do.

322
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,640
I want to open a garage.

323
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:19,920
Some day. Fixing cars, you know?

324
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,960
Sometimes cars attract
ambitious men.

325
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,880
Yeah, well...I like fixing cars.

326
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,760
I'll go. I got it.

327
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,600
Maypole 245.

328
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,560
Arthur, have you checked your post?

329
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,120
I just got served a black hand.

330
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:53,520
I just got delivered a black fucking
hand to the house.

331
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,400
From Luca Changretta.

332
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,800
Jesus!

333
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:00,920
Jesus Christ!

334
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,920
Wait a minute, John,
which one was Luca?

335
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,520
The old man's oldest son.

336
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,800
He was going to get done for
killing a bank clerk in a robbery,

337
00:28:11,800 --> 00:28:13,760
so his old man sent him
back to New York.

338
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,640
You know what the black hand means
among the wops, Arthur?

339
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,600
It's Mafia shit.

340
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:23,360
The Sicilian fucking Mafia!

341
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,600
Check your post, Arthur.

342
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,240
Arthur, I was just leaving.
No, you're not.

343
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:41,000
I need...I need to talk to you.
Arthur?

344
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,000
It's all right, Linda. Stay here.
Ada, please.

345
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,680
Linda? You stay here.

346
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,840
Did you say Mafia?

347
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,520
Esme, I need to make a call. No!

348
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,600
I need to make a fucking call! Give
it here! What the fuck is this?!

349
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,960
Give it here! Not until you tell me
what the fuck it is!

350
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,400
Give it here! What is it?!

351
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,800
It's from Luca Changretta,
all right? We killed his dad.

352
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,200
I remember.
It was Tommy who killed him!

353
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,000
It was fucking Arthur
pulled the trigger!

354
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,800
All right, it was mercy,
but it was Arthur!

355
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:29,680
Anyway,
it makes no fucking difference!

356
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,960
For the wops, it's family.

357
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:33,520
The black hand came here.

358
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,280
Everybody will have got one.

359
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:37,160
They're coming for us all!

360
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,440
We made an agreement.

361
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,160
We made a solemn promise.

362
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:49,480
We're the family now.

363
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,640
Here, look at that.

364
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,720
That's from Changretta's son, Luca.

365
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:08,440
How the fuck he
knows where I live. Eh?

366
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,840
And why's he waited a year?

367
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:14,120
I'm going to see Tommy next.
I'll talk to him.

368
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:18,840
I've been served a black hand
and she won't even let me

369
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,600
keep a fucking
spud gun in the house.

370
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:22,200
Go to a hotel.

371
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,720
It's Christmas Eve, Ada.

372
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:30,600
I've got a gun in the glove
compartment. You take that for now.

373
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,480
I'll talk to Tommy
and have him call.

374
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,120
Just make sure you get to the
phone first. Yeah. Now hug me,

375
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,600
like you came out here
because you were emotional.

376
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:42,440
I am emotional. I just don't know
what fucking emotion it is.

377
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,160
It'll be OK. I'll talk to Tommy.

378
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,800
You talk to him.

379
00:30:54,360 --> 00:30:55,800
You and me both, brother.

380
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:04,320
Ada!

381
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,640
You wait there,
you won't leave empty handed.

382
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,200
Here you go, look, some eggs,

383
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,920
you give them to Polly, all right?

384
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,360
And you, keep your eyes on the road.

385
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,840
Take care.

386
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:27,640
Who was on the phone, Arthur?

387
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,640
John. Wishing me Merry Christmas.

388
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:37,440
Come inside. It's getting late.

389
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,280
Thanks.

390
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,160
Take off the hat.

391
00:32:39,320 --> 00:32:41,200
Are you with those other Italians?

392
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:46,040
We're Americans.
It says it right there on the paper.

393
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,840
USA.

394
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:54,480
And what's the purpose
of your visit?

395
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:57,600
Pleasure.

396
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,320
Mum? It's me.

397
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,760
You left the door open.

398
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,040
To change the air.

399
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,880
I told you I was busy today.

400
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:24,920
What do you want?

401
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:28,440
Why haven't you opened your post?

402
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,680
I tidied up.

403
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:34,320
Ada's coming today.

404
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,360
She's late.

405
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,320
Tommy asked about you today.

406
00:33:40,640 --> 00:33:42,960
I hope Ada's car hasn't broken down.

407
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,760
Is Shelby Company Limited
still using Bentleys?

408
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:47,800
Yeah.

409
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:50,520
Bentleys are no good in the cold.

410
00:33:50,520 --> 00:33:52,240
You should tell him.

411
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,440
I will.

412
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,600
Any other messages for Tommy?

413
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:57,960
Yeah. Fuck off.

414
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:04,200
He saw that your drain pipe
was broken. He was worried.

415
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,880
Is that it? Is that all
he asked about? Drainpipes?

416
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,240
No. He said that I'm to accept
that you have a gift.

417
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,720
That you've always had a gift.

418
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,440
What gift?

419
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,200
Second sight.

420
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,560
Spirits. All that gypsy stuff,
he said that I'm to believe you.

421
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,560
You think I don't
hear his voice in yours.

422
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,800
You don't think
I recognise his strategies.

423
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,640
I'm still a match for him.

424
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:35,680
Yes.

425
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:38,960
You are. And you still can be.

426
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:43,200
Me and Lizzie decided that

427
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:45,760
this New Year
we're all to turn the page.

428
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,480
You can't spend another
year like this, Mum. "Mum."

429
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,520
Mum.

430
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:01,880
That word is like a bullet to me.

431
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:11,120
I see your sister in
that chair sometimes...

432
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:18,480
Look, me and Lizzie
have decided.

433
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:22,640
It's time.

434
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,960
I bought these.

435
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,400
One for you and Ada

436
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,040
and one for you and me.

437
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,280
So Tommy said,
"Keep her off the whisky."

438
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,960
I'll drink Champagne
the day my son leaves

439
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:46,280
the employment
of Shelby Company Limited.

440
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:49,000
You tell him that next time
he mentions fucking drainpipes.

441
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:12,840
Right. Now, this is your job,
Charlie. We give those to Santa

442
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:14,440
and Rudolph.

443
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,520
Good boy. Put this out for Santa,
for his whisky.

444
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,880
Now, night-night. Merry Christmas.

445
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:29,240
I will see you tomorrow. Sleep well.
Come on, Charlie.

446
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,400
Mr Shelby, it's your sister.

447
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,800
I know. Send her in.

448
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,480
I got a card, Ada.

449
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,640
I'm guessing Arthur
and John have had one as well.

450
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:13,080
Hello, Tommy. "Hello, Ada, welcome
home." Thanks, it's nice to be back.

451
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:17,600
I've spoken to Moss.

452
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:20,360
Moss said Changretta is a soldier
for the Spinetti family,

453
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:23,080
which means he will have men
with him, professional men.

454
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:25,720
They usually operate in
units of around ten.

455
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,040
Moss is checking Cunard records to
see if they're already in England.

456
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,360
This one's for you.

457
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:34,120
What is it? A time machine?

458
00:38:34,120 --> 00:38:36,280
My God. Tommy Shelby.

459
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,760
Is that regret?

460
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:39,360
I'll open it tomorrow.

461
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:43,760
So, boss, in the light of
the changed circumstances,

462
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:45,320
what are your orders?

463
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:51,840
Changretta knows where we all live.

464
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,520
If we stay out
in the open, isolated,

465
00:38:53,520 --> 00:38:54,880
he'll pick us off one by one.

466
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,840
We need to be together in a place
even they won't dare to come.

467
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,800
You mean back home?

468
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,760
Within a four-mile radius
of the Garrison,

469
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,760
every man is a guard
and a soldier for us.

470
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:11,040
I'm calling a family meeting.
Charlie Strong's yard, Boxing Day.

471
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:13,520
Finn's already there.
You tell Polly and Michael.

472
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,920
I'll deal with John and Arthur.

473
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,400
And Esme and Linda?

474
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,280
Anyone who wants to live
to see another Christmas

475
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,640
needs to come to where it's safe.

476
00:39:21,640 --> 00:39:23,800
These bastards
will kill kids as well.

477
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,560
When this business is finished,
we can...go our separate ways.

478
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,880
Go and see Polly and explain.

479
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,400
She'll have had a card as well.

480
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:38,560
Do you think I'm on the list?

481
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:40,080
We're all on the list, Ada.

482
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:44,400
I gave my gun to Arthur.

483
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,800
Welcome home.

484
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:25,800
Holy shit, it's Father Christmas.

485
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:30,160
Yeah, and if you're good...
you get what you deserve.

486
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,840
Fucking come here, you!

487
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,760
Fuck.

488
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:19,200
Yeah, put me through to Maypole 245.

489
00:41:29,040 --> 00:41:31,440
Hello. Arthur, it's Tommy.

490
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,920
Be quick, they're asleep.

491
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:37,640
Family meeting,
Charlie's yard, Boxing Day, midday.

492
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:40,880
I can't raise John but
I'll send Michael to get him.

493
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:45,480
If you have to pull a gun on Linda,
do it. Merry Christmas.

494
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,800
Merry Christmas, Tom.

495
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:04,520
What did you do with them?

496
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,600
My tablets were in
the bathroom cabinet.

497
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,760
What did you do with them?

498
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:11,480
I threw them in the lavatory.

499
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,120
Tommy's orders?

500
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:16,280
No. My own decision.

501
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:23,240
How am I going to get through
Christmas without them?

502
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,560
They close everything.

503
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,680
How am I going to get through
Christmas without them?

504
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,600
I'll help you.
They don't open anything.

505
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:30,200
Fucking no apothecary, nothing.

506
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:33,800
You can move in with me
and I'll help you.

507
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,840
How can I get through
fucking Christmas? Without...

508
00:42:37,840 --> 00:42:40,360
Without anything! How?

509
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:47,320
You can move in with me
and I'll help you.

510
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:50,200
Fuck off! Fuck off!
Fuck off, Thomas Shelby!

511
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,680
Fuck off! It's all right it's me.
Mum, this as got to stop!

512
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,880
I don't want you,
I don't want you, Thomas Shelby.

513
00:42:54,880 --> 00:42:56,440
My husband is back and he loves me.

514
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:58,840
Tommy said to believe in
spirits with you, but I can't.

515
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:01,960
Hello, Polly. Hello, Michael.
Merry Christmas.

516
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,480
The door was wide open.

517
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:05,800
Fuck.

518
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:11,080
I spent the whole day tidying up.
I wanted it to be nice.

519
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,640
I wanted it to look nice!

520
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,440
Why, Pol? It's only me.

521
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,680
It's OK. It's OK.

522
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:20,280
We can sit, sit and talk
and put things back together.

523
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,720
It's OK.

524
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,920
I'll leave you two to it.
No, you stay.

525
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,920
Now, listen, something's happened.
Things have changed.

526
00:43:32,120 --> 00:43:36,560
Today everyone in the family
received one of these.

527
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,200
What does it mean?

528
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,800
Tommy's called a family meeting.
He wants you both to come.

529
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:05,200
Come.

530
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,200
I'm really sorry to
bother you again, sir,

531
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:17,720
but Chef insists on knowing
what time the guests will arrive.

532
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:25,560
Francis, for the last time,
it's Johnny Dogs. They're gypsies.

533
00:44:25,560 --> 00:44:27,360
They're camped down by the river.

534
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,880
When they're ready
they'll walk up. All right?

535
00:44:29,880 --> 00:44:32,400
He says it's about preparation, sir.

536
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,840
What is?

537
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:35,920
He's asked specifically.

538
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:38,160
Will they arrive before
the King's speech or after?

539
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,720
You said he was new, this chef.

540
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:49,080
When did join us?

541
00:44:49,080 --> 00:44:50,120
October.

542
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,720
October.

543
00:44:57,080 --> 00:44:58,520
And he's foreign?

544
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:00,680
He's Italian, sir.

545
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:05,160
Oh. He's the best chef we've
ever had in the house.

546
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,000
No shouting or swearing
or blaspheming.

547
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:10,400
Do we have his references?

548
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:11,880
Yes.

549
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,720
The only problem
has been his assistant.

550
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:18,280
What assistant?

551
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:21,520
He brought an assistant with him.
He calls him his sous-chef.

552
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,320
Are they still working, Frances?

553
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,160
They'll be there till midnight, sir.

554
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,840
Right, thank you. Good night.

555
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,880
You can go to bed.

556
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:40,280
Merry Christmas, sir.

557
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,160
And I thought about your offer.

558
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,320
I'd be happy to sit at your table.

559
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,760
Right, thank you.

560
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:31,960
What's your name?

561
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:33,080
Max, Mr Shelby.

562
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,280
Max.

563
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,920
It's all right. Don't get up.

564
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:42,280
Oh. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry, yes.

565
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:47,800
You're new. I'm Mr Shelby.

566
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:49,440
Hello, sir.

567
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:52,360
I haven't taken time to
introduce myself.

568
00:46:54,040 --> 00:46:55,560
Antonio.

569
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,960
What have you done
that's so wrong, eh?

570
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,720
Excuse me?

571
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,720
A sous-chef peeling potatoes.

572
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:11,280
It's an emergency. Late notice.

573
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:14,240
Oh. Late notice.

574
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,320
Right, right, carry on.

575
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,720
Antonio...

576
00:47:30,120 --> 00:47:33,280
..here, 10£.

577
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,680
For the late notice.

578
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:15,600
You wanted to know if
my guests would arrive

579
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:17,200
before or after the King's speech?

580
00:48:21,240 --> 00:48:23,120
Eh? Yes.

581
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:26,840
It'll be after.

582
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,720
How are you?

583
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,920
Oh, just...worried about tomorrow.

584
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,080
Yeah? I'm worried about Antonio.

585
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,040
You've been here two months
and we've not met before.

586
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:55,960
It's my fault. I've been busy.

587
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:58,680
Thomas Shelby.

588
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,200
My hand has blood.

589
00:49:03,200 --> 00:49:04,640
Oh, mine too.

590
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:11,960
Hey, er, how much do
you pay Antonio?

591
00:49:13,720 --> 00:49:15,120
I forget.

592
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,520
Must be a lot.

593
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:19,680
I just gave him ?10.

594
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,760
Didn't mean a fucking thing to him.

595
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,280
Maybe it isn't you that pays him.

596
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,240
I've been reading up on you.

597
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:46,120
Bertorelli. Claridge's.

598
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:51,080
You used to work in a place
called San Marco's,

599
00:49:51,080 --> 00:49:54,440
on...on Fleet Street.

600
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,760
I used to know the man
that owned San Marco's.

601
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:02,400
A man called Darby Sabini.

602
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:06,520
I never met him. No.

603
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:11,920
Maybe your...assistant, Antonio,
maybe he's met him.

604
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,720
Here's how it is.

605
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:19,560
Antonio was sent from New York.
I don't know. Please...

606
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,000
Darby Sabini facilitated.

607
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,040
He passed him on to you and told
you to bring him into my house.

608
00:50:24,040 --> 00:50:27,560
They threatened to kill you
if you didn't do it.

609
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:30,480
You want me to dress you like
you dressed that fucking stag?

610
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:32,120
Please!

611
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:38,480
You know about me, right? Mm-hm.

612
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,040
You know what I do? Mm-hm.

613
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:44,680
You wanted to know when
my guests would arrive

614
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,320
because Antonio needed me alone.
He's an assassin.

615
00:50:47,320 --> 00:50:49,520
The plan is to kill me tomorrow.

616
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,120
I don't know.

617
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,040
They just said bring him here.

618
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:03,000
Well, bring him here.

619
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,360
Antonio!

620
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:08,920
You are a black hand!
You are a black hand!

621
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:13,000
How many came from New York?
How many fucking came from New York?

622
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:14,560
Vaffanculo!

623
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:19,000
What did he... What did he say?
Is that a curse or a number?

624
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:21,680
What did he fucking say?
What did he fucking say?

625
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:23,520
He said, "Fuck you." Yeah?

626
00:52:35,160 --> 00:52:37,840
The black hand means
kill or be killed.

627
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,640
You go back to London,

628
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:45,480
you tell Darby Sabini he picked
the wrong side in this war.

629
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:50,160
Once we've dealt with the Americans,
we'll come for him.

630
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:51,960
Go on, go.

631
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,120
Go.

632
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:57,760
Oi! You tell anyone else,
I'll come and find you.

633
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,040
Harrow 335.

634
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:21,720
The Hare and Hounds pub.

635
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,400
Robert. Yes, it's Mr Shelby.

636
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,280
Merry Christmas to you too.

637
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,760
Robert, is there a gypsy in
the public bar playing

638
00:53:36,760 --> 00:53:38,760
the fiddle for shillings?

639
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,240
Yes.

640
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:43,600
Can you, er, can you tell him
I need to speak to him?

641
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:45,400
Thank you.

642
00:53:57,720 --> 00:53:59,360
Oh, fuck, Tom.

643
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:02,360
I thought these sporting
days were over.

644
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:05,120
Yeah, so did I.
But they keep coming back at us.

645
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,760
There's a black stallion
in the stables.

646
00:54:08,760 --> 00:54:11,000
He's invisible at night, use him.

647
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:13,440
Take the body across the river
to the rough ground.

648
00:54:14,720 --> 00:54:17,600
Burn him? No. This one's a message.

649
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,200
Will there still be
geese for dinner?

650
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:24,600
Only if you can steal them
on the way. On the way where?

651
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:27,440
We're going back, Johnny.

652
00:54:29,600 --> 00:54:31,160
Back to Small Heath.

653
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:32,720
Back where you belong.

654
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,800
Merry Christmas.
You can keep the stallion.

655
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,640
Christ the fucking night.

656
00:54:57,560 --> 00:55:01,360
Michael, they're coming today.
Michael, shut up and listen.

657
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:02,920
You've got to get everyone out.

658
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,200
Get Polly and Ada to Charlie's yard.

659
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:07,120
I've told Arthur
but I can't reach John.

660
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:08,920
When you've dropped Polly and Ada,

661
00:55:08,920 --> 00:55:11,400
go out to John's place
and get him out. All right?

662
00:55:14,080 --> 00:55:18,040
Is it Christmas?
Not just yet. Let's go, eh? Mummy!

663
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,240
Move!

664
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,320
Hello?

665
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:57,040
Oh, fuck. It's you. Got nothing
better to do on Christmas morning?

666
00:55:57,040 --> 00:56:00,360
Tommy wants everybody at
Charlie's yard now. Come on.

667
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:04,800
Get in. Get in. What's going to
happen? It's fucking Christmas.

668
00:56:04,800 --> 00:56:07,680
Look, John, we don't
have time for this.

669
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,520
Come into the house. Just come
to the meeting. Have some food.

670
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:14,280
Tell Tommy Shelby
we can look after ourselves.

671
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,320
Tommy says they could
come for us today.

672
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,400
Tommy says, Tommy says.
Are you his fucking parrot?

673
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:19,960
Look it's the Mafia, all right.

674
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:22,320
This is the New York Mafia
we're talking about.

675
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,440
And we're
the Peaky fucking Blinders.

676
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:25,720
No, we're not, John.

677
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:28,480
We're not the Peaky fucking Blinders
unless we're together.

678
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,880
You were together on the gallows,

679
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:32,480
with one man missing.

680
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:37,520
John? John, come to the meeting,
all right? Think about the kids.

681
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:40,280
Come to the meeting and
if you want to leave then fine.

682
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:45,120
No. It's Christmas Day.
We're the family now.

683
00:56:45,120 --> 00:56:46,280
We're staying at home.

684
00:56:49,240 --> 00:56:51,000
In the fucking house! Esme...

685
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:54,640
John!

686
00:56:55,164 --> 00:56:57,164
.::Sub#One::.
