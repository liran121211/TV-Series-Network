1
00:00:02,459 --> 00:00:04,490
You've both met bad men before.

2
00:00:04,833 --> 00:00:07,403
The man we're about to meet
is the devil.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:09,173
Michael Gray.

4
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,139
You lost all your cousin's money
in America playing the fool.

5
00:00:12,294 --> 00:00:17,014
And poor old Arthur Shelby
is afraid his wife will never return.

6
00:00:19,644 --> 00:00:24,284
There's a bullet,
and on it is carved the name McCavern.

7
00:00:27,287 --> 00:00:28,951
It's war you want,

8
00:00:29,184 --> 00:00:31,053
it's war you shall have.

9
00:00:31,143 --> 00:00:32,905
I've been talking to the Friends.

10
00:00:33,069 --> 00:00:34,733
One of the Friends is a man.

11
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:37,280
He would die without his eyes.

12
00:00:37,420 --> 00:00:39,819
These hands belong to the devil!

13
00:00:40,078 --> 00:00:42,709
By the time
that baby draws its first breath,

14
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,303
you and I will be done.

15
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:46,701
You will be king.

16
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,436
Happy or sad, Tommy?

17
00:01:26,228 --> 00:01:28,228

Episode Title: <font color=#FFFF00>"The Loop"</font>

19
00:01:40,955 --> 00:01:42,717
Mr Shelby.

20
00:01:44,491 --> 00:01:48,842
My bullets ache
to get inside your tinker head.

21
00:01:50,749 --> 00:01:53,475
♪ Up to our knees in Fenian blood ♪

22
00:01:53,593 --> 00:01:56,106
♪ Surrender or you'll die ♪

23
00:01:56,194 --> 00:02:00,076
♪ We are the Brigton Derry Billy Boys. ♪

24
00:02:35,021 --> 00:02:36,850
You know, it's a pity.

25
00:02:37,312 --> 00:02:39,397
I was looking forward to killing you.

26
00:02:40,616 --> 00:02:42,733
You're at the back of a long queue.

27
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,045
My white flag is a flag of truce.

28
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,490
Yours is more a flag of surrender.

29
00:02:51,685 --> 00:02:54,646
Whatever you say, Mr McCavern,
the colour is the same.

30
00:02:54,734 --> 00:02:56,287
The outcome is the same.

31
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:59,013
I believe we've friends in common.

32
00:02:59,101 --> 00:03:00,811
We should postpone our war.

33
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,975
Your brother left me a hand grenade.

34
00:03:03,063 --> 00:03:04,764
He sends his apologies.

35
00:03:05,287 --> 00:03:07,100
You left me land mines.

36
00:03:07,553 --> 00:03:09,756
For which I too apologise.

37
00:03:10,478 --> 00:03:12,170
Then peace it is.

38
00:03:12,785 --> 00:03:16,350
Your message said you wanted
to seal our truce with some business.

39
00:03:17,572 --> 00:03:21,248
Since we're men of similar interests
and distribution networks,

40
00:03:21,336 --> 00:03:23,572
I thought we might use
our temporary settlement

41
00:03:23,679 --> 00:03:25,712
for our mutual benefit.

42
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:28,772
You stand in a yard full of scrap metal
and stolen goods,

43
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:30,451
and you talk like a politician.

44
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:33,842
No, nothing here is stolen, Mr McCavern.

45
00:03:34,033 --> 00:03:36,826
Charlie simply finds things
before they're lost.

46
00:03:38,814 --> 00:03:42,007
The nature of the deal
is explained in my proposal.

47
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:45,920
I've booked you a suite
at the Midland Hotel.

48
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:49,380
If you need anything in this city,
just mention my name.

49
00:03:49,985 --> 00:03:52,607
So you want to impress me, Mr Shelby?

50
00:03:53,292 --> 00:03:54,725
Isiah.

51
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:03,207
Also in the envelope is a cheque
for £500.

52
00:04:03,295 --> 00:04:05,943
For your wife.
She can use it to buy a black dress,

53
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:09,186
rent a black horse with black feathers

54
00:04:09,475 --> 00:04:12,131
to pull a black carriage
with your body in it,

55
00:04:12,494 --> 00:04:15,490
should you break the terms
of the white flag.

56
00:04:16,763 --> 00:04:21,271
Now, please, enjoy the city
it's my honour to represent.

57
00:04:44,739 --> 00:04:46,532
This week I've managed
to get to the people

58
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,396
at York and Lincoln City.
I mean, they're the teams that are losing.

59
00:04:49,598 --> 00:04:50,896
I got to them.

60
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:54,493
Right, go on. Go on, take your time.

61
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:55,654
Mm.

62
00:04:57,279 --> 00:04:59,813
I got to the goalkeepers,
they all said £5 is enough.

63
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,021
I, erm...

64
00:05:03,695 --> 00:05:06,865
I've written to the people
at Tranmere Rovers

65
00:05:06,953 --> 00:05:09,896
because the phone you put
into my... into my house stopped working.

66
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,818
So I'm gonna need
another one of those.

67
00:05:11,906 --> 00:05:12,926
OK.

68
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:17,146
Once we've got that fixed,
hey, then we'll have all the names

69
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:21,623
and numbers
of the First Division referees.

70
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:22,824
The First?

71
00:05:22,912 --> 00:05:23,985
Yeah.

72
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:27,420
Ah, shit, shit, shit, shit.

73
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,256
Come on, come on. Come on.

74
00:05:29,344 --> 00:05:32,137
Listen, listen to me.
Come on now.

75
00:05:32,502 --> 00:05:34,175
No need for that. Hm?

76
00:05:34,308 --> 00:05:35,373
Yeah.

77
00:05:35,461 --> 00:05:37,779
We need you to find out
what they like.

78
00:05:38,002 --> 00:05:40,303
You know, what gets them going.

79
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:44,414
Cos a lot of them are comfortable.
A fiver's nothing to them.

80
00:05:44,587 --> 00:05:47,029
We need you to find out
what they really like playing.

81
00:05:47,117 --> 00:05:49,975
- Yes.
- See, cos we can offer them that.

82
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:52,194
Oh, yeah. Shelby Company Limited,

83
00:05:52,282 --> 00:05:56,334
we can offer them
all the lovely things people like.

84
00:05:56,917 --> 00:05:57,997
Hm?

85
00:05:58,436 --> 00:06:03,764
We can also offer 'em protection
from the things they don't like.

86
00:06:05,066 --> 00:06:06,975
You ever touch my family...

87
00:06:08,026 --> 00:06:09,850
..ever...

88
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,252
York.

89
00:06:14,755 --> 00:06:15,895
Lincoln.

90
00:06:15,983 --> 00:06:17,396
- Lincoln?
- Hm.

91
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:21,740
Tranmere Rovers.

92
00:06:21,854 --> 00:06:22,998
Hm?

93
00:06:23,086 --> 00:06:24,566
Mm-hm.

94
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:28,803
- Bye, Finn.
- Goodbye, brother.

95
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:32,209
Shit.

96
00:06:50,693 --> 00:06:54,100
It's all right, Mrs Connors.
You can carry on. It's just my brother.

97
00:06:57,506 --> 00:06:59,453
So tell me how it happened?

98
00:06:59,928 --> 00:07:02,178
They were sleeping downstairs.

99
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:05,022
And then my husband came home...

100
00:07:05,731 --> 00:07:08,412
..drunk from the Marquis,
even though he just lost his job.

101
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:10,123
We don't have any money.

102
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:14,303
Anyway, he came to bed.

103
00:07:14,606 --> 00:07:16,928
But... downstairs,
they must have heard a noise.

104
00:07:17,016 --> 00:07:18,089
They woke up.

105
00:07:18,231 --> 00:07:20,482
They started, er, calling out.

106
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,279
They woke my husband up, and...

107
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:26,748
..when he's drunk,
you don't wake him up.

108
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:30,279
What happened then, Mrs Connors?

109
00:07:31,219 --> 00:07:32,652
He, erm...

110
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,764
He...

111
00:07:35,142 --> 00:07:37,045
He went downstairs.

112
00:07:38,929 --> 00:07:40,279
He killed them.

113
00:07:41,897 --> 00:07:43,850
Strangled them.
All three of them.

114
00:07:46,148 --> 00:07:47,928
And you've, erm...

115
00:07:49,147 --> 00:07:52,029
You've... you've brought
their bodies here today with you.

116
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,545
Proof, Mr Shelby.

117
00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:11,795
Their singing was the only pretty thing
in my life.

118
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:16,529
I don't care my husband beats me...

119
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,380
..but not this.

120
00:08:21,662 --> 00:08:22,975
Mrs Connors.

121
00:08:23,172 --> 00:08:24,646
We have your address.

122
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,873
We will speak to your husband.

123
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,787
My brother here

124
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,948
will go to the Bull Ring market today,

125
00:08:32,127 --> 00:08:34,303
and buy you three new goldfinches,

126
00:08:34,468 --> 00:08:36,932
and have them delivered
to your door.

127
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:39,865
The same colours
and, you know, feathers.

128
00:08:40,427 --> 00:08:43,764
The new ones I will call
Thomas, Arthur and Finn.

129
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:46,420
That'll make him pause,

130
00:08:46,508 --> 00:08:48,228
even when he's drunk.

131
00:08:49,371 --> 00:08:51,014
Good day, Mr Shelby.

132
00:08:52,055 --> 00:08:53,488
You take care, Mrs Connors.

133
00:08:53,576 --> 00:08:54,725
Bye.

134
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:02,912
I don't know how you do this, Tom.
I really don't!

135
00:09:03,217 --> 00:09:05,123
You learn things, Arthur.

136
00:09:06,634 --> 00:09:09,972
That woman
has only two rooms downstairs.

137
00:09:10,178 --> 00:09:13,545
Her husband has lost his job
and he beats her.

138
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:16,292
And yet, the thing that brings her

139
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:20,490
to see her Member of Parliament
is songbirds.

140
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,923
Now, that's politics, Arthur.

141
00:09:24,073 --> 00:09:25,826
It's not for me.

142
00:09:26,038 --> 00:09:27,151
Anyway, look.

143
00:09:27,239 --> 00:09:28,600
That list of losers.

144
00:09:28,688 --> 00:09:30,561
How much have we made
on the football?

145
00:09:30,649 --> 00:09:34,053
Ten grand this week.
Finn showing promise, Tom.

146
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:35,923
Maybe we should put him
on the tracks.

147
00:09:36,264 --> 00:09:37,834
Just a thought.

148
00:09:40,623 --> 00:09:41,865
- Finn.
- Yeah.

149
00:09:41,953 --> 00:09:44,342
- Your lunchtime delivery.
- Bring her in.

150
00:09:51,637 --> 00:09:55,115
Tommy, the next fella
wants to see both of you.

151
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:59,529
- Do you know his face?
- No. He's Chinese.

152
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,084
Chinese in our pub?

153
00:10:05,665 --> 00:10:06,842
Tom...

154
00:10:08,352 --> 00:10:09,811
All right.

155
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:12,631
Slowly, Micky, let him in.

156
00:10:15,757 --> 00:10:21,357
Three little birds, eh,
Tommy, Finn and Arthur.

157
00:10:27,647 --> 00:10:29,021
Mr Thomas.

158
00:10:32,536 --> 00:10:33,756
Mr Arthur.

159
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,826
My name is Brilliant Chang.

160
00:10:46,074 --> 00:10:49,162
Brilliant Chang is dead.

161
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,095
Perhaps.

162
00:10:52,988 --> 00:10:54,741
Sometimes I wonder,

163
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,113
"Is this heaven?"

164
00:10:59,098 --> 00:11:01,318
Doesn't smell like heaven...

165
00:11:01,658 --> 00:11:04,482
..so I would say I have survived.

166
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:10,818
- What happened to Maggie?
- You don't like me?

167
00:11:12,961 --> 00:11:14,801
I like everything.

168
00:11:17,544 --> 00:11:21,646
I like fucking everything.

169
00:11:27,911 --> 00:11:30,834
You should answer the phone,
Mr Shelby.

170
00:11:35,044 --> 00:11:37,021
Micky, bring that phone here now.

171
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:40,882
Hello?

172
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,967
Arthur! Arthur!

173
00:11:44,864 --> 00:11:48,292
I sent a woman with a gun
to your youngest brother's office.

174
00:11:48,747 --> 00:11:49,892
All right, Finn.

175
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,451
Right, right.

176
00:11:54,091 --> 00:11:55,635
What the fuck is going on?

177
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:02,139
Do you want to die again, Chang?
Huh?

178
00:12:04,259 --> 00:12:05,452
Good.

179
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:07,201
The guns are pointed.

180
00:12:07,289 --> 00:12:09,350
Now we are all concentrating.

181
00:12:09,826 --> 00:12:11,998
The moment is now pure.

182
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:14,293
Purity is not necessary.

183
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:17,013
Displays are not necessary.

184
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:22,620
They said, "Tommy Shelby.
That door will need some kicking down."

185
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,959
When you walked through that door,
it was open.

186
00:12:28,196 --> 00:12:30,749
You don't need to do anything
to get my attention.

187
00:12:31,521 --> 00:12:33,756
Now, what exactly do you want?

188
00:12:39,077 --> 00:12:41,904
Do you have a match, Mr Shelby?

189
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,193
Anything happens to my brother, Chang...

190
00:12:50,031 --> 00:12:51,671
..you die.

191
00:13:05,806 --> 00:13:07,012
If you die here today,

192
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,732
we'll bury you face down
with no hands.

193
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:12,561
- You'll go straight to hell.
- I don't care about rituals.

194
00:13:12,761 --> 00:13:15,436
I am a rationalist,
Mr Shelby.

195
00:13:15,993 --> 00:13:18,146
Well, tell your friend on the phone

196
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,943
to put her gun down
and we can all have a talk.

197
00:13:27,535 --> 00:13:29,490
Hold your fire, brother!

198
00:13:29,834 --> 00:13:31,554
Hold your fire!

199
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,064
I'm all right.

200
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,654
She fired into the ceiling.

201
00:13:38,761 --> 00:13:40,674
Finn's all right.

202
00:13:40,933 --> 00:13:42,279
Finn's OK.

203
00:13:49,086 --> 00:13:51,759
Give me your order! Mm.

204
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,092
Give me your order, Tommy!

205
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,333
Yes or no.

206
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:56,701
At ease.

207
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,592
I said at ease.

208
00:14:16,381 --> 00:14:19,412
May I take something
from my pocket, Mr Shelby?

209
00:14:52,572 --> 00:14:57,185
And it's the purest opium
that has ever arrived in Europe.

210
00:14:57,486 --> 00:15:01,319
No salt, no flour, no lies.

211
00:15:01,438 --> 00:15:02,895
Pure truth.

212
00:15:04,374 --> 00:15:06,767
Came off a ship called the Capital,

213
00:15:07,143 --> 00:15:08,816
out of Shanghai.

214
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,122
Docked at Poplar a week ago.

215
00:15:11,714 --> 00:15:14,012
The stevedores
were held at gunpoint,

216
00:15:14,192 --> 00:15:18,333
Chinese unloaded the cargo
by the light of lanterns.

217
00:15:19,171 --> 00:15:24,442
A foreman at the dock estimated there was
seven tonnes of the stuff.

218
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:27,778
I made a note at the time.

219
00:15:30,814 --> 00:15:33,130
I spoke to that particular foreman

220
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:35,333
and I worked out that

221
00:15:35,630 --> 00:15:39,349
seven tonnes of pure opium crystals
would be worth...

222
00:15:40,964 --> 00:15:46,271
..approximately, £1,190,000

223
00:15:46,726 --> 00:15:48,864
on international markets.

224
00:15:53,065 --> 00:15:55,122
The big crash. Hm?

225
00:15:56,392 --> 00:15:57,927
Wall Street.

226
00:15:58,138 --> 00:16:01,692
Now we all keep our ears open
for opportunities.

227
00:16:06,845 --> 00:16:09,318
- What the fuck is going on?
- What are you playing at?

228
00:16:10,546 --> 00:16:13,579
Finn, we are conducting
a piece of business.

229
00:16:13,667 --> 00:16:15,810
She had a gun to my fucking head!

230
00:16:16,564 --> 00:16:18,216
But your trousers are dry.

231
00:16:18,522 --> 00:16:19,935
You didn't piss yourself.

232
00:16:20,023 --> 00:16:22,534
- He didn't piss himself, Arthur.
- Well done, Finn.

233
00:16:22,622 --> 00:16:25,583
You had a dispute with a lady
and you didn't piss yourself.

234
00:16:25,671 --> 00:16:28,304
And Arthur here tells me
we should put you on the tracks.

235
00:16:28,477 --> 00:16:31,177
Gonna be a good day for you after all,
Finn.

236
00:16:31,265 --> 00:16:32,331
Give me that!

237
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:33,466
Hey!

238
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:36,333
Always have your whores
searched at the door.

239
00:16:37,105 --> 00:16:39,060
- If I see that bitch on the street,
- Yeah, all right.

240
00:16:39,148 --> 00:16:41,381
- I'll fucking cut her.
- All right, come on.

241
00:16:47,418 --> 00:16:50,130
This is a gift, Mr Shelby.

242
00:16:52,097 --> 00:16:53,974
A gesture of goodwill.

243
00:17:04,431 --> 00:17:05,919
I'll throw it in the canal.

244
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:12,247
Canals are the idea. Right, Chang?

245
00:17:38,581 --> 00:17:41,534
I'm sorry for calling the meeting here,
but the location is part of the deal.

246
00:17:41,731 --> 00:17:43,927
What fucking deal?

247
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:47,497
How does it feel
to be barefoot in the mud again, Pol?

248
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,833
It makes me feel young.
What fucking deal?

249
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,364
Four boats.

250
00:17:52,591 --> 00:17:53,935
Four days.

251
00:17:54,192 --> 00:17:56,625
Up the Grand Union from Poplar to here.

252
00:17:56,713 --> 00:18:00,966
Half the cargo is coal
and underneath the coal,

253
00:18:01,405 --> 00:18:03,202
pure opium crystal.

254
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:04,944
Opium.

255
00:18:05,426 --> 00:18:07,046
I vote against it.

256
00:18:07,426 --> 00:18:08,919
They can't use trucks

257
00:18:09,007 --> 00:18:11,444
because the Chinese drivers
get stopped by the police.

258
00:18:11,532 --> 00:18:12,805
They need to get it out of London

259
00:18:12,893 --> 00:18:15,406
because all the warehouses
are being searched by Customs.

260
00:18:15,663 --> 00:18:18,819
The seven tonnes
is bound for San Francisco,

261
00:18:18,907 --> 00:18:21,900
but the outward ship doesn't sail
for seven days from Liverpool.

262
00:18:22,158 --> 00:18:23,751
They need somewhere safe to store it.

263
00:18:23,870 --> 00:18:27,863
All we have to do is take it up the canal
and keep it here for a week.

264
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:31,249
We don't fuck with the Chinese, though,
Tom. Dad always said it.

265
00:18:31,352 --> 00:18:35,025
Ask yourself, would he turn down £250,000

266
00:18:35,123 --> 00:18:37,717
to drive four boats up the canal

267
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,780
with no prospect of inspection?

268
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,533
I vote against it, Tom. Hm.

269
00:18:43,702 --> 00:18:45,613
- Mm-mm.
- Polly?

270
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,928
£250,000.

271
00:18:48,016 --> 00:18:51,413
That's half of what Michael lost
in Chicago.

272
00:18:51,786 --> 00:18:54,859
I will ask him to take charge
of this business.

273
00:18:54,947 --> 00:18:57,717
Michael's position will be reinstated
in the company?

274
00:18:58,014 --> 00:19:00,928
His period of quarantine would be over.

275
00:19:06,074 --> 00:19:07,307
Think about it, brother.

276
00:19:07,457 --> 00:19:09,890
Four boats sailing up the cut,

277
00:19:09,978 --> 00:19:12,194
smelling of wood smoke and bacon.

278
00:19:14,225 --> 00:19:16,852
And which one
of Charlie's Gypsy didicoy friends

279
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:21,288
do you trust, Tom, eh,
with a cargo worth £1 million?

280
00:19:21,376 --> 00:19:23,764
I've already made provision.
I'm needed at a meeting.

281
00:19:23,852 --> 00:19:25,163
Let's vote.

282
00:19:26,439 --> 00:19:28,217
Those in favour.

283
00:19:38,339 --> 00:19:42,803
Motion carried.
Arthur, tell Charlie we need four boats

284
00:19:42,891 --> 00:19:45,428
and four tonnes of coal
before it gets dark.

285
00:19:45,516 --> 00:19:47,327
They sail south tonight.

286
00:19:48,214 --> 00:19:52,727
And don't forget to go to the Bull Ring
and get them three songbirds, Arthur.

287
00:19:52,947 --> 00:19:54,413
Yes, Tommy.

288
00:19:55,241 --> 00:19:56,866
Fuck!

289
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:13,241
What have you heard, Pol?

290
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:17,608
The man you cut went to the police...

291
00:20:19,038 --> 00:20:20,522
..but we dealt with it.

292
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:25,006
Is she with him?

293
00:20:26,246 --> 00:20:29,319
If she was, it would be your fault,
Arthur.

294
00:20:29,936 --> 00:20:33,614
But they say his face is so badly cut
he's hard to look at.

295
00:20:33,702 --> 00:20:35,772
So I would say not.

296
00:20:36,546 --> 00:20:41,546
I would also say
it is time to give up on Linda,

297
00:20:43,154 --> 00:20:48,124
find someone else
who might be able to put your fires out.

298
00:20:59,968 --> 00:21:01,912
I can't, though, Pol.

299
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,311
I fucking can't!

300
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:10,991
And that's it.

301
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,952
That's it.

302
00:21:29,065 --> 00:21:30,600
Whiskey?

303
00:21:30,762 --> 00:21:32,178
Thank you, no.

304
00:21:43,317 --> 00:21:47,436
For reasons I can't divulge,
I need to keep Jimmy McCavern alive.

305
00:21:47,912 --> 00:21:50,506
I've already got a time and a place
for the killing.

306
00:21:51,147 --> 00:21:52,475
You see?

307
00:21:53,866 --> 00:21:56,947
A little alleyway by a shipyard canteen.

308
00:21:57,066 --> 00:22:00,139
A girl called Karen who hates him,
who will give him up.

309
00:22:00,387 --> 00:22:05,186
I have the sound of cranes and winches
to cover the gunshot.

310
00:22:05,306 --> 00:22:07,939
I've got a Bentley to get me away.

311
00:22:08,264 --> 00:22:10,020
The war with the Billy Boys is postponed.

312
00:22:10,108 --> 00:22:12,921
We've made peace.
We're gonna do business together.

313
00:22:13,386 --> 00:22:16,259
When that business is done,
he's all yours.

314
00:22:16,905 --> 00:22:20,663
You can avenge the death of your son
in any way you see fit.

315
00:22:20,946 --> 00:22:22,979
You mean when you say.

316
00:22:23,185 --> 00:22:25,035
When you check
that little stopwatch you've got

317
00:22:25,123 --> 00:22:28,100
that,,, controls the turning of the Earth.

318
00:22:28,968 --> 00:22:30,178
Yeah.

319
00:22:31,426 --> 00:22:33,249
And then you will marry
and you will settle.

320
00:22:33,337 --> 00:22:36,225
Marry? Marry who, Mr Shelby?

321
00:22:38,187 --> 00:22:40,178
Just let me understand you.

322
00:22:40,466 --> 00:22:44,030
Do you mean
that Polly is part of this deal?

323
00:22:44,866 --> 00:22:46,335
Yeah.

324
00:22:49,758 --> 00:22:54,155
Well, Holy Lord God,
Tommy Shelby OBE,

325
00:22:54,358 --> 00:22:56,579
does your vanity have no limits?

326
00:22:56,764 --> 00:22:58,859
I believe it is called the ego these days.

327
00:22:59,328 --> 00:23:00,551
I read books.

328
00:23:00,639 --> 00:23:03,381
You sit on your throne
and you instruct Polly Gray,

329
00:23:03,469 --> 00:23:05,436
who is of far richer blood than you,

330
00:23:05,524 --> 00:23:08,357
as to when she can
and when she can't marry.

331
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:10,413
Oh, no, she instructs herself.

332
00:23:10,945 --> 00:23:12,881
She has her own strategies.

333
00:23:12,969 --> 00:23:14,538
And we are of the same blood.

334
00:23:14,626 --> 00:23:19,419
She will marry you, but only if you agree
to postpone any attack on McCavern

335
00:23:19,506 --> 00:23:20,975
until this business is done.

336
00:23:21,194 --> 00:23:25,296
So she is some young Gypsy bride
that's yours to give away.

337
00:23:25,826 --> 00:23:29,249
Young she is,
when she's barefoot on the cobbles.

338
00:23:29,786 --> 00:23:33,465
What about a dowry, then, Mr Shelby?
If it's gonna be done in the old way,

339
00:23:33,553 --> 00:23:36,139
well, you know, you throw in
a few coloured ponies or...

340
00:23:36,386 --> 00:23:38,499
I'm having an event at my house.

341
00:23:38,741 --> 00:23:40,139
You are invited.

342
00:23:40,444 --> 00:23:42,179
Polly will be there.

343
00:23:43,014 --> 00:23:45,902
There will be candles and violins

344
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,436
and dancing.

345
00:23:47,788 --> 00:23:50,539
Polly wants you to propose
in the proper way,

346
00:23:50,626 --> 00:23:53,153
and then she will give you
her terms of acceptance.

347
00:23:53,241 --> 00:23:56,381
Inviting you for this purpose
was Polly's idea.

348
00:24:03,146 --> 00:24:05,561
- You can't read?
- I don't read.

349
00:24:05,986 --> 00:24:07,819
- It's Swan Lake.
- Ballet?

350
00:24:08,083 --> 00:24:09,223
Yeah.

351
00:24:09,303 --> 00:24:11,379
Apparently, it's about love.

352
00:24:11,671 --> 00:24:13,659
Polly says that, for now,

353
00:24:13,816 --> 00:24:16,155
love must defeat revenge.

354
00:24:38,946 --> 00:24:41,428
...As a result of the greed and the excess

355
00:24:41,592 --> 00:24:46,499
of a small number of bankers, financiers
and other feckless gamblers.

356
00:24:47,866 --> 00:24:49,530
This comprehensive document,

357
00:24:49,639 --> 00:24:53,450
pleading for Government intervention
in all areas of economic life,

358
00:24:53,538 --> 00:24:56,397
represents not just socialism,

359
00:24:56,529 --> 00:25:00,543
but a new breed of National Socialism.

360
00:25:01,946 --> 00:25:05,579
And I believe... I believe
that the leaders of my own party

361
00:25:05,746 --> 00:25:08,842
have been very foolish to reject it.

362
00:25:52,053 --> 00:25:55,834
How on earth did you get a ballet company
to come to your bloody house?

363
00:25:57,026 --> 00:25:59,061
It's an independent dance company

364
00:25:59,155 --> 00:26:01,999
dedicated to bringing ballet
to the people.

365
00:26:02,306 --> 00:26:03,913
We share a philosophy.

366
00:26:04,001 --> 00:26:05,194
I'm a patron.

367
00:26:05,426 --> 00:26:09,459
I also gave them a lot of money.

368
00:26:10,746 --> 00:26:11,928
Oh.

369
00:26:14,026 --> 00:26:15,699
And this date

370
00:26:16,083 --> 00:26:18,053
is your wife's birthday.

371
00:26:19,533 --> 00:26:20,773
Yeah.

372
00:26:21,351 --> 00:26:23,391
The party is for her.

373
00:26:25,338 --> 00:26:28,569
And she likes ballet, your wife?

374
00:26:35,252 --> 00:26:36,655
Why wouldn't she?

375
00:26:37,893 --> 00:26:39,077
It's just...

376
00:26:39,165 --> 00:26:42,045
Well, you see,
I did some research into her.

377
00:26:43,747 --> 00:26:45,380
Into her past.

378
00:26:45,491 --> 00:26:49,264
If you want to buy her a gift,
she likes diamonds.

379
00:26:53,889 --> 00:26:56,348
Now that we are going to be
conquering the world together,

380
00:26:56,436 --> 00:26:58,499
we need to have no secrets.

381
00:26:58,716 --> 00:27:01,647
We should know
each other's weaknesses.

382
00:27:03,506 --> 00:27:06,569
Your wife has led an interesting life.

383
00:27:08,146 --> 00:27:11,278
It may even be possible that,
as a younger man in Birmingham,

384
00:27:11,366 --> 00:27:13,577
I came across her.

385
00:27:14,865 --> 00:27:18,499
My friends and I would sometimes go
to nightclubs in the south of town.

386
00:27:19,586 --> 00:27:23,866
Well, if you recognise her,
maybe you can talk about old times, eh?

387
00:27:25,086 --> 00:27:28,397
Maybe, if we have met before,
your wife and I

388
00:27:28,485 --> 00:27:30,788
could even renew our acquaintance.

389
00:27:32,786 --> 00:27:35,561
I am invited to stay the night, yes?

390
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:40,842
I too have done some research,
Sir Oswald.

391
00:27:41,942 --> 00:27:43,015
Yeah.

392
00:27:43,141 --> 00:27:48,038
I researched your wife
and your wife's younger sister

393
00:27:48,608 --> 00:27:51,179
and your wife's stepmother, Lady Curzon,

394
00:27:51,608 --> 00:27:54,019
all of whom you are fucking.

395
00:27:54,389 --> 00:27:57,092
If such things were to take place
on a narrowboat,

396
00:27:57,213 --> 00:27:58,973
the Church would get involved.

397
00:28:00,255 --> 00:28:01,455
But...

398
00:28:02,307 --> 00:28:04,717
..it's not happening on a narrowboat.

399
00:28:05,895 --> 00:28:11,319
No. It's taking place in your apartment,
in your country house,

400
00:28:11,466 --> 00:28:16,663
sometimes even in your office
here in the House of Commons.

401
00:28:17,717 --> 00:28:19,967
So no secrets. And, yes,

402
00:28:20,346 --> 00:28:22,614
yes, you are invited to stay the night

403
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:26,709
with... whichever member of your family
finds favour.

404
00:28:27,483 --> 00:28:29,489
Now, if you don't mind,
I was about to leave,

405
00:28:29,577 --> 00:28:31,466
I need to lock up my office.

406
00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:44,124
Actually, I will come alone.

407
00:28:45,346 --> 00:28:48,179
In society, you are judged
by your hospitality.

408
00:28:48,267 --> 00:28:50,467
I will expect adventure.

409
00:29:00,798 --> 00:29:03,751
Such rogues we are, aren't we?

410
00:29:04,717 --> 00:29:07,116
Sing like songbirds in the House.

411
00:29:07,866 --> 00:29:09,153
And then, afterwards,

412
00:29:09,241 --> 00:29:12,538
relieve ourselves in the bodies
of whomever we choose.

413
00:29:15,397 --> 00:29:19,366
Two men for whom forbidding
is forbidden.

414
00:29:20,466 --> 00:29:22,186
It should be quite the party.

415
00:30:03,706 --> 00:30:07,139
You have to listen to the voices
that you hear.

416
00:30:07,553 --> 00:30:09,225
Do what they tell you to do.

417
00:30:11,744 --> 00:30:15,342
You don't even have to rub the lamp
any more to summon the genie.

418
00:30:17,087 --> 00:30:19,483
It wasn't the blue stone, Tommy.

419
00:30:20,545 --> 00:30:21,975
It was you.

420
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:25,045
It was you.

421
00:31:39,991 --> 00:31:41,539
Who is it?

422
00:31:41,913 --> 00:31:43,299
It's Tommy's car outside.

423
00:31:43,386 --> 00:31:45,733
It's him. I'll get it.

424
00:31:53,025 --> 00:31:54,458
What's happened?

425
00:31:54,639 --> 00:31:56,779
Nothing's happened. I'm all right.

426
00:31:56,866 --> 00:31:58,069
Come in.

427
00:32:01,106 --> 00:32:02,334
Do you want a drink?

428
00:32:02,522 --> 00:32:04,506
- No.
- No?

429
00:32:04,706 --> 00:32:07,709
No. I have some information
for the intelligence officer...

430
00:32:08,478 --> 00:32:10,670
...on conversations with Mosley.

431
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:14,499
He's planning to put forward proposals
for building works.

432
00:32:14,586 --> 00:32:16,257
He, erm...

433
00:32:16,746 --> 00:32:19,739
He wants the Communists to consider
his new party as fraternal,

434
00:32:19,826 --> 00:32:23,339
which means his activities
are now part of your official remit? Yeah?

435
00:32:23,426 --> 00:32:26,299
Mr Shelby, it's 2am.
You can make your report any time.

436
00:32:26,444 --> 00:32:28,946
- Why don't you stay tonight?
- No.

437
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:34,662
I'll leave you two to...

438
00:32:34,756 --> 00:32:36,768
Yes, good night.

439
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:54,808
I stood on a bridge tonight, Ada.

440
00:32:55,212 --> 00:32:56,706
And I looked down.

441
00:32:58,346 --> 00:32:59,906
And Grace was there...

442
00:33:01,405 --> 00:33:02,698
..but she was still alive.

443
00:33:02,786 --> 00:33:04,659
Tom, have you still been taking laudanum?

444
00:33:04,746 --> 00:33:07,214
The fucking name of the barge
was the January.

445
00:33:09,066 --> 00:33:10,495
Our dad's boat.

446
00:33:10,583 --> 00:33:13,256
The boat I was born on.
We've never got nothing.

447
00:33:13,523 --> 00:33:16,292
We've never got nothing.
And we never fucking will.

448
00:33:19,052 --> 00:33:22,673
Dr Brooke said that you never arrived
for your appointment, Tom.

449
00:33:22,761 --> 00:33:24,179
No.

450
00:33:24,266 --> 00:33:26,808
There's nothing in his books
of any use to a man like me.

451
00:33:26,941 --> 00:33:28,370
They talk about guilt.

452
00:33:28,466 --> 00:33:29,859
Eh?

453
00:33:29,946 --> 00:33:31,899
Guilt! What fucking guilt?

454
00:33:31,986 --> 00:33:34,699
- The black barge.
- No. No, that's not it.

455
00:33:34,786 --> 00:33:36,699
That's not it. He had it right.

456
00:33:36,786 --> 00:33:41,001
Mosley had it right.
He said, "Forbidding is forbidden to us.

457
00:33:41,089 --> 00:33:44,362
"We can do anything.
Nothing can stop us."

458
00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:47,823
But there's a part of me
that is unfamiliar to myself.

459
00:33:49,458 --> 00:33:51,393
And I keep finding myself there.

460
00:33:53,086 --> 00:33:55,479
And only the January can get me away.

461
00:33:58,752 --> 00:34:01,487
Will you at least try
the doctors again, Tom?

462
00:34:05,461 --> 00:34:07,558
Well, then at least throw away your opium.

463
00:34:07,706 --> 00:34:09,399
It's that that causes the visions.

464
00:34:09,502 --> 00:34:11,204
Just... throw it away.

465
00:34:11,292 --> 00:34:12,918
While it's there, it's a temptation.

466
00:34:14,168 --> 00:34:15,862
How much have you got left?

467
00:34:16,557 --> 00:34:17,910
Seven tonnes.

468
00:34:18,886 --> 00:34:21,386
- Seven tonnes?
- Yeah.

469
00:34:26,741 --> 00:34:28,901
I'd hate for it to run out, Ada.

470
00:34:40,564 --> 00:34:42,183
You do me a favour?

471
00:34:44,605 --> 00:34:49,401
When that kid of yours arrives,
keep it away from me.

472
00:35:05,005 --> 00:35:06,798
A fucking ballet.

473
00:35:07,354 --> 00:35:09,206
He wants to impress someone.

474
00:35:09,825 --> 00:35:11,498
And I'm invited?

475
00:35:11,734 --> 00:35:13,300
You and Gina.

476
00:35:14,563 --> 00:35:15,972
Why?

477
00:35:17,426 --> 00:35:21,151
Because he wants to give you
the chance, to come back properly.

478
00:35:32,426 --> 00:35:33,539
Coal haulage?

479
00:35:33,659 --> 00:35:34,899
Yeah.

480
00:35:34,986 --> 00:35:39,026
Tommy wants you to reopen those books
and become managing director.

481
00:35:39,933 --> 00:35:43,745
So I've come back from Detroit
to become a coal man?

482
00:35:45,076 --> 00:35:48,549
The first delivery
is bound for San Francisco,

483
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:50,870
but if it works...

484
00:35:51,226 --> 00:35:54,659
...Tommy thinks he can find
distribution for it here.

485
00:35:56,266 --> 00:35:59,146
And this, erm, this coal...

486
00:36:00,346 --> 00:36:02,511
- ...is it snow white?
- No.

487
00:36:03,506 --> 00:36:04,972
Golden brown.

488
00:36:07,444 --> 00:36:09,026
Fuck.

489
00:36:11,746 --> 00:36:14,059
This is your opportunity, Michael.

490
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:17,712
There is more money in this
than there is

491
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,667
in all the other parts of our business
put together.

492
00:36:34,776 --> 00:36:36,979
Tommy knows
what opium does to people.

493
00:36:37,251 --> 00:36:39,542
Tommy knows
what whiskey does to people.

494
00:36:39,866 --> 00:36:41,946
He got an OBE for selling it.

495
00:36:45,294 --> 00:36:46,814
I'll speak to Gina.

496
00:36:49,213 --> 00:36:50,502
You'll what?

497
00:36:50,729 --> 00:36:53,026
I will consult my wife.

498
00:36:54,306 --> 00:36:56,573
Your father ran this business
for a bit.

499
00:36:56,946 --> 00:36:58,511
1901.

500
00:36:58,866 --> 00:37:00,720
And he shipped coal. Real coal.

501
00:37:00,808 --> 00:37:02,419
Just coal.

502
00:37:02,506 --> 00:37:08,643
And his fingernails and his eyelids
and his ears were black with it.

503
00:37:08,916 --> 00:37:11,498
And the merchants would offer them
one price

504
00:37:11,586 --> 00:37:13,206
and then only pay half

505
00:37:13,459 --> 00:37:15,065
because they could.

506
00:37:15,427 --> 00:37:18,067
And that was wrong, Michael.

507
00:37:41,606 --> 00:37:46,573
Run your hands through it,
get it under your skin...

508
00:37:47,577 --> 00:37:51,901
..and then see if Gina will let you
lay a finger on her.

509
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:03,810
I think golden brown
is more to her taste.

510
00:38:05,335 --> 00:38:09,240
Especially when you tell her
how much money you're going to earn.

511
00:38:30,342 --> 00:38:32,865
Now we're in business together,
I should ask,

512
00:38:33,066 --> 00:38:36,092
which foot do you kick the ball with,
Mr Shelby?

513
00:38:36,306 --> 00:38:37,740
I have no religion.

514
00:38:38,866 --> 00:38:40,599
Some nights I wish I had.

515
00:38:41,341 --> 00:38:42,873
He's kin?

516
00:38:43,485 --> 00:38:44,998
Yeah.

517
00:38:46,005 --> 00:38:47,763
And the simple fellow?

518
00:38:48,572 --> 00:38:51,615
He's a lot less simple
than you might at first think.

519
00:38:52,979 --> 00:38:54,560
Do you trust them?

520
00:39:00,426 --> 00:39:02,592
Right. So I take a boatload.

521
00:39:03,297 --> 00:39:04,610
No.

522
00:39:04,706 --> 00:39:08,256
Ten sacks to start with,
so you can test the market.

523
00:39:08,646 --> 00:39:10,474
Then we'll deal in boatloads.

524
00:39:10,746 --> 00:39:13,076
Cash payment on loading.

525
00:39:13,426 --> 00:39:15,068
£10,000.

526
00:39:16,106 --> 00:39:18,240
For that amount,
it'll have to be a cheque.

527
00:39:18,484 --> 00:39:20,162
I don't take cheques.

528
00:39:23,346 --> 00:39:24,888
It'll be a cheque.

529
00:39:28,443 --> 00:39:29,476
I will take a cheque

530
00:39:29,564 --> 00:39:32,105
if it's guaranteed
by our mutual friend in London,

531
00:39:32,193 --> 00:39:33,615
Mr Mosley.

532
00:39:46,271 --> 00:39:48,373
Well, who would've thought
I'd be doing business

533
00:39:48,461 --> 00:39:51,888
with fucking Gypsy Catholic scum?

534
00:39:53,636 --> 00:39:56,701
Yeah, who'd have thought,
eh, Charlie?

535
00:39:57,091 --> 00:39:58,604
Who would have thought it?

536
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,098
Aye, but you're OK.

537
00:40:01,186 --> 00:40:04,601
Yeah, I'm only OK
until I'm not OK.

538
00:40:05,367 --> 00:40:07,382
Then I'm really not.

539
00:40:09,055 --> 00:40:12,343
Delivery in seven days.

540
00:40:13,703 --> 00:40:15,057
Cheque guaranteed.

541
00:40:15,145 --> 00:40:18,458
Won't your Chinese friends
expect the seven tonnes that leaves London

542
00:40:18,546 --> 00:40:20,899
to still be seven tonnes
when it reaches Liverpool?

543
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:23,350
You leave that to me, Mr McCavern.

544
00:40:23,669 --> 00:40:27,092
Oh, you mean you're bold enough
to skim the Chinese?

545
00:40:29,846 --> 00:40:32,966
You have some kind of death wish,
Mr Shelby?

546
00:40:51,168 --> 00:40:54,506
An evening with a tribe of Gypsies.

547
00:40:57,036 --> 00:40:59,764
When you've unpacked,
there should be a girl laid on for you.

548
00:41:01,186 --> 00:41:02,788
Mr Shelby is a socialist

549
00:41:02,876 --> 00:41:05,670
and believes in equality of service
for all classes.

550
00:41:16,178 --> 00:41:20,019
According to the invitation,
there'll be an interval at nine o'clock.

551
00:41:20,106 --> 00:41:22,217
Say that you're feeling tired
and we'll leave.

552
00:41:23,559 --> 00:41:27,552
Well, if you see a duke,
introduce me.

553
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:29,852
My God, at last!

554
00:41:30,041 --> 00:41:32,225
Something you like about England.

555
00:41:34,743 --> 00:41:38,037
Gina, I've been made an offer.

556
00:41:40,245 --> 00:41:42,115
To come back into the company.

557
00:41:42,526 --> 00:41:43,839
Michael, we agreed,

558
00:41:43,950 --> 00:41:46,978
the baby will be born in New York.
Remember?

559
00:41:47,066 --> 00:41:48,717
The job is haulage.

560
00:41:49,308 --> 00:41:51,287
Supply. Transport.

561
00:41:52,986 --> 00:41:54,436
Opium.

562
00:41:58,426 --> 00:42:01,233
- Tommy has made contact...
- Tommy!

563
00:42:02,217 --> 00:42:04,850
Tommy has made contact
with Chinese suppliers

564
00:42:04,938 --> 00:42:07,201
who have plantations
in the Afghan hills.

565
00:42:08,085 --> 00:42:09,483
Pure grade.

566
00:42:11,007 --> 00:42:14,694
We will take delivery
and ship it all over Europe.

567
00:42:15,986 --> 00:42:17,451
You mean heroin?

568
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:20,139
Yes.

569
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,959
And how much would you make?

570
00:42:26,026 --> 00:42:29,899
Conservative estimate,
three shipments a year from Shanghai,

571
00:42:29,986 --> 00:42:31,365
seven tonnes each,

572
00:42:31,626 --> 00:42:34,279
stand to make approximately
£1 million.

573
00:42:34,518 --> 00:42:35,779
Per annum.

574
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,154
The company will make three.

575
00:42:42,856 --> 00:42:45,334
We could go to New York
whenever we wanted.

576
00:42:46,294 --> 00:42:48,389
On our own fucking plane.

577
00:42:51,506 --> 00:42:54,053
- We always have to come back, right?
- Yes.

578
00:42:54,706 --> 00:42:57,209
For £1 million a year, we do.

579
00:42:59,651 --> 00:43:02,244
What happens if you get caught?

580
00:43:02,386 --> 00:43:03,733
Tommy has friends.

581
00:43:05,157 --> 00:43:08,725
If the ship gets stopped,
it'll be the Chinese who hang.

582
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:12,951
Think about it, Gina.

583
00:43:14,452 --> 00:43:16,694
When we move into our house...

584
00:43:17,438 --> 00:43:21,522
...our room for entertaining
will be twice this size.

585
00:43:25,346 --> 00:43:26,653
Will it now?

586
00:43:29,746 --> 00:43:31,755
The magazines say that

587
00:43:31,986 --> 00:43:35,676
it's all straight lines and simplicity
in the 1930s.

588
00:43:36,786 --> 00:43:38,270
Deco is dead.

589
00:43:41,129 --> 00:43:44,872
We'll be able to afford
dukes and duchesses.

590
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:47,733
And maybe...

591
00:43:47,906 --> 00:43:50,005
...maybe a princess or two.

592
00:43:51,508 --> 00:43:54,161
And the painting on the wall
will be of you.

593
00:43:55,586 --> 00:43:58,299
Because Tommy Shelby will be gone

594
00:43:58,598 --> 00:44:01,223
and it will be Michael Gray
arranging the ballet.

595
00:44:03,571 --> 00:44:05,051
Where will Tommy be?

596
00:44:06,986 --> 00:44:08,762
Where he wants to go to most.

597
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,989
Ah.

598
00:44:14,540 --> 00:44:15,825
There.

599
00:44:17,106 --> 00:44:18,762
A lord.

600
00:44:18,986 --> 00:44:22,356
Actually, I think Mr Mosley's a baronet.

601
00:44:28,306 --> 00:44:30,567
Where the fuck is Tommy anyway?

602
00:44:45,604 --> 00:44:46,942
Tommy...

603
00:44:48,022 --> 00:44:49,343
My house.

604
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:51,413
My wife.

605
00:44:52,144 --> 00:44:53,585
Let 'em wait.

606
00:44:58,146 --> 00:44:59,708
Sir Oswald.

607
00:45:01,666 --> 00:45:03,755
Do I not get announced?

608
00:45:04,386 --> 00:45:06,066
Mr Shelby asked me to tell you

609
00:45:06,154 --> 00:45:08,990
that he's busy
with the catering preparations

610
00:45:09,148 --> 00:45:11,169
and will be joining you shortly.

611
00:45:12,445 --> 00:45:15,255
In the meantime,
and while you're waiting,

612
00:45:15,404 --> 00:45:18,544
we have opium, cocaine and brandy.

613
00:45:20,226 --> 00:45:23,333
I don't use opium or cocaine,

614
00:45:23,586 --> 00:45:26,544
and brandy is for after dinner,
not before.

615
00:45:27,826 --> 00:45:31,130
I also have a list of options
for the end of the evening.

616
00:45:31,771 --> 00:45:35,951
You'll notice that
the maids wear name tags.

617
00:45:36,269 --> 00:45:38,427
We hired them specially...

618
00:45:39,178 --> 00:45:41,888
...for those guests staying the night.

619
00:45:42,100 --> 00:45:46,708
All things are available
except the ballerinas.

620
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:51,740
And who, might I ask, are you?

621
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,224
I am a queen amongst the Romanies.

622
00:45:56,972 --> 00:45:59,974
And I too am unavailable.

623
00:46:08,823 --> 00:46:10,216
Lizzie.

624
00:46:10,428 --> 00:46:13,741
There's something I didn't tell you
about this evening.

625
00:46:13,906 --> 00:46:15,659
Something about our guest.

626
00:46:16,191 --> 00:46:17,708
Mosley.

627
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:21,543
It's possible that...

628
00:46:21,638 --> 00:46:23,471
...that you've met him before.

629
00:46:23,777 --> 00:46:25,083
Before when?

630
00:46:27,026 --> 00:46:29,466
Before you became
\who you are.

631
00:46:31,986 --> 00:46:34,052
Would you even remember him?

632
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:36,659
Would he remember you?

633
00:46:38,626 --> 00:46:41,619
All I remember is,
I drank too much champagne.

634
00:46:41,786 --> 00:46:43,810
I wasn't taking cash.

635
00:46:46,454 --> 00:46:47,904
Lizzie...

636
00:46:50,746 --> 00:46:52,411
There's a pile of bodies...

637
00:46:53,306 --> 00:46:54,919
..floating by.

638
00:46:55,586 --> 00:46:57,036
Let 'em go, Lizzie.

639
00:46:58,758 --> 00:47:00,122
Let 'em go.

640
00:47:03,826 --> 00:47:05,779
So that's why you brought me
in here.

641
00:47:06,177 --> 00:47:07,997
To lay your claim.

642
00:47:09,506 --> 00:47:10,763
Yeah.

643
00:47:14,506 --> 00:47:16,716
Well, it's a start, I suppose.

644
00:47:18,466 --> 00:47:25,091
He lays a fucking hand on you,
he will be meat for Johnny Dogs.

645
00:47:28,925 --> 00:47:31,161
You were indisposed
when I arrived.

646
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:43,303
In society, you greet a guest,
you don't leave them hanging...

647
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:46,301
..looking around like a fucking dog.

648
00:47:47,028 --> 00:47:49,939
Before we join
the others, I have some business.

649
00:47:50,127 --> 00:47:51,770
I need a signature.

650
00:47:52,004 --> 00:47:55,121
By the way,
your brandy before dinner thing amuses me,

651
00:47:55,209 --> 00:47:57,606
but none of the maids are of interest.

652
00:47:57,746 --> 00:48:00,387
And I despise the use of drugs.

653
00:48:01,543 --> 00:48:04,371
Your strategies are very transparent.

654
00:48:05,306 --> 00:48:08,549
I'm involved in a transaction
with Jimmy McCavern,

655
00:48:08,637 --> 00:48:10,899
your acquaintance from the north.

656
00:48:11,027 --> 00:48:12,941
I have no idea who you mean.

657
00:48:13,029 --> 00:48:15,382
I don't trust him.
He wants to pay by cheque.

658
00:48:15,746 --> 00:48:18,762
I need your signature
as a guarantor on the transaction

659
00:48:18,902 --> 00:48:20,793
should his cheque fail to be honoured.

660
00:48:20,884 --> 00:48:22,837
The sum is £10,000.

661
00:48:22,925 --> 00:48:25,038
And what is it he's buying from you?

662
00:48:25,226 --> 00:48:26,339
A gin distillery.

663
00:48:26,457 --> 00:48:28,512
He's buying my old one.
I'm buying a new one.

664
00:48:29,747 --> 00:48:30,947
Hmm.

665
00:48:34,107 --> 00:48:36,129
So not only is the truce holding,

666
00:48:36,217 --> 00:48:38,809
but you two
are actually doing business.

667
00:48:38,980 --> 00:48:41,902
Yeah. But I still don't trust his cheques.

668
00:48:44,026 --> 00:48:46,139
If I sign a cheque guarantee
for this man,

669
00:48:46,226 --> 00:48:48,899
it is proof of a connection
between me and him.

670
00:48:49,168 --> 00:48:51,785
Something you could later use
against me.

671
00:48:53,408 --> 00:48:56,012
Why would I want to move against you?

672
00:49:12,266 --> 00:49:14,621
You're curious about my weaknesses.

673
00:49:16,506 --> 00:49:19,168
And you've learned it's not cocaine,

674
00:49:19,573 --> 00:49:21,645
not maids.

675
00:49:30,844 --> 00:49:35,664
But now you will learn my weakness
is a tendency to trust people.

676
00:49:35,752 --> 00:49:37,152
Do you have a pen?

677
00:49:53,146 --> 00:49:54,549
Mr Shelby.

678
00:49:56,385 --> 00:49:58,383
I know you have no classical education,

679
00:49:58,471 --> 00:50:01,563
but just realised you are
the perfect balance between the gods

680
00:50:01,651 --> 00:50:03,253
Dionysus and Apollo.

681
00:50:03,391 --> 00:50:08,198
Irrational frenzy
controlled by reason and self reflection.

682
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:13,432
Do you know the work
of Friedrich Nietzsche?

683
00:50:13,866 --> 00:50:15,651
- No.
- Freud?

684
00:50:16,049 --> 00:50:17,393
Yes.

685
00:50:17,609 --> 00:50:19,089
Ah.

686
00:50:23,596 --> 00:50:24,829
There.

687
00:50:25,729 --> 00:50:27,917
Your guarantee of trust.

688
00:50:29,190 --> 00:50:32,339
Now perhaps you would introduce me
to your wonderful wife.

689
00:50:36,890 --> 00:50:38,803
So, did you know?

690
00:50:39,046 --> 00:50:40,495
What?

691
00:50:41,143 --> 00:50:43,376
Oh, that tonight's special guest
might have fucked you

692
00:50:43,464 --> 00:50:45,237
when you were a nightclub hostess?

693
00:50:45,734 --> 00:50:46,839
Yeah.

694
00:50:48,385 --> 00:50:51,258
Lizzie, if we were to strike
from our guest lists

695
00:50:51,346 --> 00:50:53,885
every man in Birmingham who you...

696
00:50:56,118 --> 00:50:58,214
- Yes or no?
- Fucking yes.

697
00:50:58,302 --> 00:50:59,557
Shit.

698
00:51:03,266 --> 00:51:06,506
Sir Oswald,
this is my wife Elizabeth.

699
00:51:06,826 --> 00:51:09,006
Lizzie, Sir Oswald Mosley.

700
00:51:11,092 --> 00:51:12,904
Since we all appear to know,

701
00:51:13,248 --> 00:51:15,365
and since knowledge is permission,

702
00:51:15,670 --> 00:51:19,519
I'm sure, Mr Shelby, in the spirit
of our honest relationship,

703
00:51:19,607 --> 00:51:21,099
you won't mind me saying

704
00:51:21,186 --> 00:51:24,240
it was a bottle of Champagne
and an evening well spent.

705
00:51:25,972 --> 00:51:29,162
Actually, it was an evening wasted.

706
00:51:30,638 --> 00:51:32,943
For the Champagne
and brandy you bought me,

707
00:51:33,107 --> 00:51:36,998
as I recall, it was the booze that put you
to sleep a little prematurely.

708
00:51:37,531 --> 00:51:42,982
Ladies and gentlemen,
the dance is about to begin.

709
00:51:46,773 --> 00:51:48,631
Mr Mosley!

710
00:51:48,766 --> 00:51:50,999
A toast, if I may.

711
00:51:51,802 --> 00:51:53,591
To the end of our deal,

712
00:51:53,906 --> 00:51:56,339
and the beginning of something more.

713
00:51:56,802 --> 00:51:58,607
Happy Birthday, Lizzie.

714
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:03,841
This way.

715
00:53:31,866 --> 00:53:35,069
Polly Gray, Gypsy queen,

716
00:53:35,266 --> 00:53:36,939
will you marry me,

717
00:53:37,194 --> 00:53:39,811
a poor commoner who loves you?

718
00:54:36,093 --> 00:54:40,968
Let's fuck before the swan dies.

719
00:55:11,159 --> 00:55:13,530
I heard there was a family occasion.

720
00:55:18,308 --> 00:55:20,100
Look, I'm sorry, Linda.

721
00:55:20,741 --> 00:55:23,019
That animal inside me,

722
00:55:23,374 --> 00:55:25,733
it comes out and I can't stop it.

723
00:55:27,547 --> 00:55:29,340
Fuck, Linda.

724
00:55:29,655 --> 00:55:31,546
Without you, I c...

725
00:55:31,843 --> 00:55:33,694
Come inside, please.

726
00:55:35,266 --> 00:55:37,059
His name was Frederick.

727
00:55:37,366 --> 00:55:39,544
All we ever did was talk, Arthur.

728
00:55:39,632 --> 00:55:41,296
He just listened.

729
00:55:42,586 --> 00:55:44,866
And now he has no face.

730
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:56,608
He's as ugly on the outside
as you are on the inside.

731
00:56:04,744 --> 00:56:07,358
May you Peaky Blinders all rot...

732
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:10,171
..in fucking hell.

733
00:56:21,194 --> 00:56:23,678
Arthur...

734
00:56:51,266 --> 00:56:54,187
