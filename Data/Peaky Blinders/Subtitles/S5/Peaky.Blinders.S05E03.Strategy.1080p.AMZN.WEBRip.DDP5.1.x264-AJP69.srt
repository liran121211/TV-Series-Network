1
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:05,480
My name is Captain Swing,
calling from the occupied Six Counties.

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,360
This Michael, your kin,

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,800
making deals with the very men
who want you dead.

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:13,000
What happened on that ship?

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,240
Said the men from Glasgow
were called Billy Boys.

6
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,160
Protestant razor gang.
They run every man east of Glasgow.

7
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,080
We have a mutual acquaintance.

8
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:27,000
These gentlemen are the Billy Boys.

9
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:28,760
I'm Jimmy.

10
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,320
I need Mr Shelby to understand that
his best is not good enough.

11
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:38,640
Your body will be the lesson.

12
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,240
Tommy, what are you talking about?

13
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,440
I'm talking about an empty chair, Ada.

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,000
My chair. My throne.

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,880
People think that I'm gonna fall,
they start to circle.

16
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,520
Who's gonna take the throne, eh?

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:01,080
Black cat dreams are never wrong.

18
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:03,760
They crucified my son...

19
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:06,920
for you.

20
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,080
Good morning, sisters.

21
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,440
Let us pray.

22
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,160
Our Father, who art in heaven...

23
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,800
but deliver us from evil...

24
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,160
for thine is the kingdom, the power
and the glory, for ever and ever...

25
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,760
Amen.

26
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:21,016
You wanted to speak to us, Mr Shelby?

27
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,600
Yeah.

28
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,600
- All of us?
- Yeah.

29
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:27,440
At 6.30 in the morning?

30
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,280
Yes.

31
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:34,600
- We don't smoke in here.
- Well, I fucking do.

32
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,440
Nor do we use language.

33
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:40,600
Nor do we find fault in the innocent.

34
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,880
Yet you do.

35
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,360
You fucking do.

36
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,520
May I ask what this meeting is about?

37
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,920
The Grace Shelby Foundation
is the biggest single source of funding

38
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,240
for this charitable institution,

39
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,440
devoted to the care of the orphaned girls
of south Birmingham, yeah?

40
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,880
For which we give thanks.

41
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,960
Uh-huh.

42
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,760
I have a temper similar to the one
described in that report.

43
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,720
Yet, unlike you,
I wait until I'm matched in size.

44
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,800
Whose report?

45
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,400
The testimony of children.

46
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,680
Who have they spoken to?

47
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,680
- You'd have them only speak to God.
- God be their witness.

48
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:32,000
There is God,
and there are the Peaky Blinders.

49
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,440
This is Sparkhill, we're in Small Heath.

50
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,360
We are much, much closer at hand than God.

51
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:40,280
And we have heard terrible things.

52
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,440
We have in this place
children of the worst sort.

53
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,280
They lie as easily as breathe.

54
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:50,520
You had a child half black,
you made her wash with a different soap.

55
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,080
Mr Shelby, your own sins are legend.

56
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:57,680
Our sins...

57
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:07,680
Our sins against the beating of children
with bricks and hoses.

58
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:09,120
Our sins.

59
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,120
Our sins...

60
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,480
against a black child
who hanged herself

61
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,040
for fear of your temper.

62
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:32,080
- I do not see how...
- You do not see!

63
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,800
Now put 'em on.

64
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,440
Put 'em on your face,

65
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:43,520
or it'll be your eyes that are broken.

66
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,240
Please don't imagine
that I won't use this minute to do it,

67
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:52,880
or that I am afraid of your prayers
or your crosses.

68
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:17,880
You see the world broken.

69
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,720
Like those beaten children will.

70
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,480
Now look at me.

71
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,880
Look at me.

72
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,000
Look at me!

73
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,640
Funding withdrawn.

74
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,400
All children to be taken
into our own institutions.

75
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,960
You have no say in where the children...

76
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,480
If I come for you,

77
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:51,400
and I still might yet decide
to come for you,

78
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:54,920
I will wear high heels
so you can hear my approach

79
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,600
on the cobblestones,
and have time to repent.

80
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,480
You listen for my footsteps.

81
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,720
Happy birthday, Pol.

82
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,960
They grow grand in the horse shit, Pol.

83
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,760
Curly, pour some beer, eh?

84
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:38,520
The train to London leaves in an hour.

85
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,480
Arthur, Michael, you're coming with me.

86
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,680
Tommy, I have to take Gina
to the hospital today.

87
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,280
A week ago,

88
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,320
one of our most trusted men
was killed by Jimmy McCavern.

89
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,840
The man we're gonna speak to in London

90
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,000
is establishing a relationship
with Jimmy McCavern.

91
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,960
So cancel your appointments,
and Ada can take Gina to the hospital.

92
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,560
That's what women do.

93
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:05,240
And clean that shit off your shoes
before you get in my car, eh?

94
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:10,400
Michael, they will give it and give it
until your case is proven,

95
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,920
and then they'll take it.

96
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:14,400
From you, but mainly from me.

97
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:18,720
Polly, you go to the hospital
and speak to Aberama Gold.

98
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:23,360
You tell him there is a strategy in place
to avenge the death of his son,

99
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,840
so not to do anything rash.

100
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,920
And take with you
the heartfelt condolences

101
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,320
of the whole family.

102
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,680
Why me?

103
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:34,720
Because Aberama Gold is in love with you.
He even got a haircut.

104
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,960
And the smell of your perfume
might help ease his pain.

105
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,520
Tommy, I'm 45 years old today.

106
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,560
45 years old
and still breaking hearts, eh?

107
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,840
- Yeah!
- To Polly!

108
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,840
Polly Gray, hmm?

109
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,880
Polly.

110
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,720
Happy Birthday, Pol, yeah?

111
00:07:49,760 --> 00:07:53,440
Curly, organise a wagon to take
Bonnie Gold's soul to heaven.

112
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:58,400
Isiah, fetch his boxing gloves
from the gym to burn with his body.

113
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,680
Michael, turn the Bentley around,
you've a train to catch.

114
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,720
And don't forget
to wipe that shit off your shoes, eh?

115
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,920
Just start up the car and drive.

116
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,440
So, what's the strategy?

117
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,800
You can smile.

118
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,360
You... don't smile.

119
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:45,960
Nice.

120
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,640
Very nice, Tom.

121
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,640
Hmm.

122
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,080
Although, I must say, I thought
your office would be bigger than this.

123
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,400
It will be.

124
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,160
Michael, you sit.

125
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:58,760
Arthur, you stand by the window.

126
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,280
So, who are we meeting?

127
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,560
The man we're about to meet

128
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,560
is the Minister
for the Duchy of Lancaster.

129
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:19,240
He's also deputy
to the Chancellor of the Exchequer

130
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,640
and Cabinet adviser
to the Prime Minister of Great Britain.

131
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,040
You've both met bad men before.

132
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,040
The man we're about to meet is the devil.

133
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:38,600
Yep.

134
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,120
Send him in.

135
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,400
I never seem to get to meet you
without your family.

136
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:22,360
I understand you know a man
called Jimmy McCavern.

137
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,120
May I take a cigarette?

138
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,680
Please.

139
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,200
Who on earth is Jimmy McCavern?

140
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,200
Over the last 12 months,

141
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,320
you've been making approaches
to various men across the country

142
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:05,560
who you think might be able
to help you in your cause.

143
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,680
McCavern is one of these men.

144
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,640
He runs the east Glasgow shipyards.
He killed an associate of mine.

145
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,520
I want to know what your strategy is.

146
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:26,680
That one's your brother, yes?

147
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,720
Yes, and I'm his business adviser.

148
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,120
We would like to talk business.

149
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,400
Michael.

150
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,720
Michael Gray.

151
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,680
You lost all your cousin's money
in America playing the fool.

152
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:52,480
A nightclub in Detroit
called the Gladiator was your regular.

153
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,720
You lost the money...

154
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,320
and found a wife there.

155
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:04,440
And poor old Arthur Shelby standing
there at the window

156
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,000
is afraid his wife will never return.

157
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:12,400
My spies tell me
she's been seen with another man.

158
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,360
Arthur... Arthur.

159
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,840
And bingo.

160
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,520
20 seconds in, and I have them
speaking their wog lingo.

161
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,560
Mr Shelby, I do have plans.

162
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,920
I will have need of men like you.

163
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:37,120
Except, of course,
there is no other man like you.

164
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:41,000
You, in particular, I need.

165
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,440
But, please,

166
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,840
don't imagine I would trouble myself
with turf wars.

167
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:49,320
You have many enemies.

168
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,200
Shuffle the pack and pick another card.

169
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:03,320
That investigation of the dead journalist,

170
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,840
the queer...
I've made that go away.

171
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,080
Read it and, uh, come back to me.

172
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:16,680
Next time, bring only an open mind
and a cigar to celebrate our union.

173
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:01,320
What the fuck was that all about, Tom?

174
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,840
Fuck.

175
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,760
Arthur!

176
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:15,880
Do not let them get inside your head.

177
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,400
That's exactly how these people work.

178
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,840
Who the fuck are these people, hmm?

179
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,440
Who the fuck are they?!

180
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:30,200
I've just been invited...

181
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:34,600
to become the deputy leader
of a brand-new political party.

182
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,440
These people say they are the future.

183
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,040
Do you want a drink?

184
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,400
I've stopped.

185
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,640
So, what have you decided?

186
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,960
I've been talking to the Friends.

187
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:10,160
- What friends?
- Quakers.

188
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:13,160
Friends who meet at the meeting house
in Bournville.

189
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,920
I'm staying in Bournville.

190
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,120
And what do they say?

191
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,800
They say I've been led astray.

192
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,960
If you've come to talk about redemption,
you're talking to the wrong person.

193
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,720
I also went to a solicitor.

194
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,000
They heard my name was Shelby,
and suddenly they were too busy.

195
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:41,040
To divorce a Shelby man,
you have to go to a solicitor in London.

196
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,280
I found one.

197
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,840
He said he'd represent me.

198
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,200
But I put the phone down.

199
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,520
Not through fear.

200
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:54,800
I chose this life, it didn't choose me.

201
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,240
Also, Lizzie, one of the Friends is a man.

202
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,280
He listens to me when I talk.

203
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:05,680
His wife died of the Spanish flu.

204
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,400
He has a daughter.

205
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,640
And you're considering making
this daughter an orphan?

206
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:12,320
Nothing has happened.

207
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,520
Nor will it.

208
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:14,960
He would die without his eyes.

209
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,720
And out of kindness,
Tommy would offer his daughter

210
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:22,480
a place in one of his institutions
for orphaned girls.

211
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,560
Or even take her into the family.

212
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:27,120
And it would begin again.

213
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,000
What is the thing, Linda?

214
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,640
The thing you can't put aside?

215
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,480
It's not Arthur.

216
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,280
It's who I am when he's there.

217
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:49,200
God hears every filthy word in my head,

218
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,440
knows every dirty thing.

219
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,600
And your Friends don't use filthy words?

220
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:56,800
If I fall this time,
I'll fall all the way.

221
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:00,640
Perhaps it's what you deserve,
with your filthy words.

222
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,760
I used to fuck seven men a day,

223
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,200
and now I'm learning
how to ride a horse side-saddle.

224
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,760
There's good and there's evil.

225
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:16,680
There's both mixed.

226
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:21,280
And that's Arthur and you... and me?

227
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:24,600
You don't get what you deserve,
you get what you take.

228
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:28,480
What about him?

229
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,200
He's making up his mind.

230
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,400
Someone called Polly Gray to see you.

231
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,320
Yes or no?

232
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:56,760
Yes.

233
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,280
I've come to take you to the clinic.

234
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,880
I already told Michael -
my husband or no-one.

235
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,720
I've got a car.

236
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,600
They have taxis,
even in this fucking city.

237
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:31,000
Look, if they don't hear a heartbeat,
they're gonna give you options.

238
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,640
None of them are nice.

239
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,760
I had my check-up three days ago.

240
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:37,600
They heard a beating heart.

241
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,600
But if they had told me
that baby had died inside of me,

242
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,720
I would have wanted someone with me.

243
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,280
My husband may do as he's told,

244
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,480
but, er, I don't.

245
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:51,680
Look, if they hear a heartbeat,
you won't need anybody with you,

246
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,480
cos you'll have the baby with you.

247
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,320
So I will leave you alone.

248
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,880
But if you get in a taxi in this city
and they hear your accent,

249
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,920
they'll take you on a grand tour.

250
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,000
Come on.

251
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:14,280
- So, when will Mum be home?
- She said she had to go to Birmingham.

252
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,000
- Do you want me to cook you something?
- Cook?

253
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:18,640
You're a man.

254
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,240
This is really not fair.

255
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,640
Your mother never told me
you were this good.

256
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,960
I'm in a club. I'm the champion.

257
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I beat people even older than you.

258
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:35,480
Even older than me?

259
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:42,640
At school, some of the children
say that black people and Jews are worse.

260
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:44,600
Worse than what?

261
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,760
Than anything.

262
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:50,200
And one teacher, Mr Hudson,

263
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,760
he calls my friend a little Jew boy.

264
00:19:56,240 --> 00:20:00,880
Karl, these days,
there are some very stupid people

265
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:03,680
saying some very stupid things.

266
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,480
OK?

267
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,840
What do you think?

268
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,320
Checkmate.

269
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,040
I think I don't want you to be my dad.

270
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:24,040
Cos my dad's white... and he's in heaven.

271
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:48,720
I came to see you in hospital
to tell you there's a strategy in place,

272
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,360
not to break you out.

273
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:54,480
Don't worry,
my sister will look after me.

274
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,480
You must stay here,

275
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:02,960
and you'll let Tommy deal
with the men who killed your son.

276
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:13,480
You're 45 today.

277
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,640
I'm probably a bit older than that.

278
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:21,280
Probably.

279
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,800
I've dealt death.

280
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,040
Now death has dealt with me.

281
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,680
I have one more killing to do
then I'll be done.

282
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,320
Happy birthday, Polly Gray.

283
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,360
Get a car and a driver.

284
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,520
Find out where the Fury family are camped.

285
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,920
I need their men to help me.

286
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:49,640
I'll need my hunting rifle, 50 bullets.

287
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,800
I'm going to Scotland.

288
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:52,920
Tonight.

289
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,840
I was expecting Ada.

290
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,040
Yeah. Give you a key, did she?

291
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,536
I was meant to meet her today,
but she said had to go to Birmingham.

292
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:18,080
Yes. Tommy sent her on a mission.

293
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,560
She's doing my job for me.

294
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:20,816
Where's Karl, eh? Where's the boy?

295
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,720
He went to buy an ice cream.

296
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:24,640
Ada said to tell you she'd be late.

297
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:27,680
- You knew I'd be here?
- Yeah, we knew you'd be here.

298
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,480
We have some business for you.

299
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:45,600
Any business I have with you, Mr Shelby,
is meant to be strictly confidential.

300
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,256
Ah, Michael.
You still have shit on your shoes.

301
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:49,320
My associate here can evidently smell it.

302
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:50,560
I don't mean any offence.

303
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,160
Here, Michael, go and find Karl

304
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,720
and buy him an ice cream, eh?

305
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,080
The man doesn't trust you.

306
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,120
Fuck you, Tom.

307
00:24:08,040 --> 00:24:09,280
You know Gina phoned.

308
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:15,200
The baby's heart's beating strong.

309
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,240
And I swear to God, Tom,

310
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:21,240
by the time
that baby draws its first breath,

311
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:22,320
you and I will be done.

312
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:29,040
And you will be king.

313
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,320
Is that it, Michael?

314
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,080
You know, Tom,

315
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,040
there are doctors in London now

316
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,280
who can talk their way into your head,
dig out all the shit.

317
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,640
Perhaps, you should see one.

318
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,200
You're still not alone.

319
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:59,840
Me brother and I are the same person.

320
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:00,960
Here.

321
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,720
Here's a letter from Mosley.

322
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,800
You should read it.

323
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,920
What investigation is he talking about?

324
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:26,200
Two weeks ago,
a journalist was killed in Maida Vale.

325
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:29,360
The night before,
he'd come to me about some story

326
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,480
he was going to write about me.

327
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,200
We had nothing to do with that killing.

328
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,200
Mosley wants you as his deputy?

329
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,680
His constituency is Smethwick.

330
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,800
It borders my own.

331
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,440
He wants Birmingham as his stronghold.

332
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:44,920
He knows I've... strong support
among working people.

333
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:49,880
We help him out at rallies,
show up at some town hall meetings.

334
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:53,120
Right, and why are you showing
this letter to me?

335
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,640
A Minister of State

336
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:57,360
who may have seditious intentions.

337
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,480
There's no proof of sedition
in this letter.

338
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,160
You work in intelligence, Younger.

339
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,480
You don't need proof.
Give it to your superiors.

340
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:06,760
Mr Shelby, I have a very specific brief.

341
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:11,000
My brief is specifically
to gather information

342
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:12,960
on the activities of communists.

343
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,840
Your immediate superior
in the intelligence unit

344
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,680
is a Colonel Patrick Wyatt, yeah?

345
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,640
I understand he regularly plays polo
with Oswald Mosley.

346
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:30,960
They share membership of various clubs
in London and Birmingham.

347
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,320
I have specific orders.

348
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,760
I am a soldier.

349
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,600
You think you can join this family?

350
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,840
I have no intention of joining a family.

351
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,560
Well, thank fuck for that,
cos, er, you'd hate our weddings.

352
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:47,360
Thought you said this was about business.

353
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:49,280
Yes - family business
and government business,

354
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,680
all in one envelope.

355
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,760
Younger, listen to me.

356
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,520
Forget about Ada.

357
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,160
Forget about weddings.

358
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,000
You know what Mosley represents.

359
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,160
You know his philosophy.

360
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:12,600
I am planning to reply to him
and tell him that I'm making up my mind.

361
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,160
But in the meantime,
you need to give me instruction.

362
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:19,120
I could fight him on my own, if I have to,

363
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:22,440
or I could join his organisation

364
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,440
and undermine him on behalf of the King.

365
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,920
But you need to make a decision.

366
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,120
I suppose there are a few things
I can do on my own initiative.

367
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,800
On your fucking feet.

368
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,400
Hello, Tom.

369
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,200
I thought you were staying over in London.

370
00:28:26,520 --> 00:28:28,600
Hello, Johnny.

371
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,520
How are you, eh?

372
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:34,040
How are your ribs?

373
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,040
You managing?

374
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,920
- Just about Tom, yeah.
- Yeah? Good.

375
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,000
And who's that?

376
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:45,000
Is it Maisie, or is it Clara?

377
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,400
Ah! Sandra.

378
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,320
Well, may I say,

379
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,080
your breakfasts are a great improvement.

380
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:59,240
Mr Shelby, I'm sorry.

381
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,680
Don't worry, Sandra.

382
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,640
The only way to get fired
from this household

383
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,080
is through burnt toast...

384
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,960
or talking to the police.

385
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,200
Go on, go to bed.

386
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:12,200
And Sandra...

387
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:17,120
everything Johnny said is lies.

388
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,400
Johnny, Johnny, Johnny...

389
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:26,720
While you was gone, I got a message, Tom.

390
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:30,520
A cousin of Aberama Gold
galloped from Meriden.

391
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:33,600
He said Aberama wants you to know
that he's gone to Scotland

392
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:35,760
to deal with his business himself,

393
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:37,440
and that you'd know what that meant.

394
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,280
Fuck!

395
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:46,200
The boy said Aberama arrived
from the hospital in Polly's Bentley.

396
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,240
She fucking helped him.

397
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,560
She fucking helped him.

398
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:58,000
But it can't be love, cos it's Polly.

399
00:29:58,040 --> 00:29:59,640
Cos it's fucking Polly.

400
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,840
All right, Johnny,
I have a job for you.

401
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:05,160
Tom, I'm in a lot of pain here.

402
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,880
I need you to go and find Aberama Gold.

403
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,840
He has kin on the Lothian border,
the Fury family.

404
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,240
Ah, for fuck's sake, Tom!

405
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,640
The Furys, they don't even use words
to fucking talk.

406
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:17,600
Just hand gestures and fucking howls.

407
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,720
You will go to them
and you will find him.

408
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,560
Tom, I am in fucking pain here.

409
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,640
- Yeah, you appear to be managing.
- I said I was just managing.

410
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,200
Well, you can just manage
to sit in a car with Arthur

411
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,760
and follow the patrin
to find the Fury family.

412
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:32,920
Arthur will take care of everything
that requires bones and muscles.

413
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,840
I warned you, Tom.
The Golds'll be the death of one of us.

414
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,320
And it looks like it's gonna be
fucking me!

415
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,440
Well, go on, open it.

416
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,160
So...

417
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,920
you heard the baby's heartbeat today.

418
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,360
Beats so fast.

419
00:30:57,400 --> 00:31:00,840
Would have been a birthday gift enough.

420
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,600
A new life.

421
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:08,640
Liberty.

422
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,160
Freedom.

423
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,560
Feels like a weapon.

424
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:22,240
I only came because Michael's
driving back from London

425
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,400
and he said he didn't want you
to be on your own.

426
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,640
So...

427
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,280
Whose idea was the gift of freedom?

428
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,480
Mine.

429
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,880
You want to take Michael
and the baby to New York?

430
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,160
Yes.

431
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,000
The baby will have two grandmothers.

432
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,160
The other one lives...

433
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:48,720
The other one lives amongst human beings.

434
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,560
The other one is a human being.

435
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:56,680
It's all right, I'm not drunk.

436
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,760
I'm just free.

437
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,280
So, what do you want?

438
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:03,920
My approval?

439
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,320
Your help.

440
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:12,640
Michael wants you to come with us.

441
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,440
We can all live in Long Island,
right on the beach.

442
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,440
Isn't Long Island in Australia?

443
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,520
Or is it in California,
amongst the Indians?

444
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:26,040
It's in New York, Polly.

445
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,360
You see, we all try and get away.

446
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,080
But we never do.

447
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,400
I wish I felt that heartbeat today.

448
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:56,160
You're starting to sound
a little sorry for yourself.

449
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,360
I'm an American.

450
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,000
We don't just go round
and round and round.

451
00:33:05,040 --> 00:33:06,160
We go in a straight line.

452
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:11,760
And my baby... will be born in New York.

453
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,560
I'm not happy about moving this meeting
to licensed premises.

454
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:33,640
You've saved your union the train fare,
and you hate London anyway.

455
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:37,000
We're looking for popular speakers
for our upcoming rally.

456
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,200
You're making quite a name for yourself
in the Commons.

457
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,920
Betty!

458
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,520
What are you drinking?

459
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:44,800
Water.

460
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,840
Bottle of Champagne, Betty.

461
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,000
You'll drink it on your own.

462
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,240
That's the idea.

463
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:52,080
Shall we sit down, Miss Eden?

464
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,880
Revolution.

465
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:24,720
So, how is life as a socialist?

466
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,760
This glass.

467
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:30,320
The bubbles.

468
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,040
They rise to the top.

469
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,600
Each bubble has the same chance to rise.

470
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:41,600
That is a very peculiar form of socialism.

471
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:42,680
And this bottle.

472
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,600
Once the cork comes out...

473
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:50,920
you can't get it back in.

474
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,840
You need to finish what you started.

475
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,760
It's cleverness, that's all.

476
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,520
So you're playing at this.

477
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,720
People can be turned around.

478
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,520
Even your people.

479
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,080
- My people?
- Yeah.

480
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:11,240
For them, it's just the same.

481
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:14,200
Communism. Fascism.

482
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,320
For most people,
it's an apple and an apple.

483
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,480
Fascism is the subject of the rally.

484
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,320
I want you to speak against it.

485
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,120
In answer to your question...

486
00:35:25,360 --> 00:35:27,240
I cannot address your rally...

487
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,000
because it's not part
of the current strategy.

488
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:36,240
Are you OK, Thomas?

489
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,240
Do you want a man to carry you home?

490
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:44,120
I knew we should not have had this meeting
on licensed premises.

491
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:01,120
Happy or sad, Thomas?

492
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:16,080
I warn you, I'll break your heart.

493
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,240
I didn't expect you home.

494
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,560
Frances said Linda was here today.

495
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,080
Frances has a very specific loyalty,
doesn't she?

496
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:48,160
Well, people are loyal
to those who pay their wages.

497
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,280
Also, Maggie at the exchange
said you made some calls.

498
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,360
Then you'll know I called a solicitor.

499
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:59,560
Did Maggie listen in to the conversation?

500
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,040
He said he'd represent me.

501
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,040
But I put the phone down.

502
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,800
There and then, I made a decision.

503
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:19,920
And when I heard your car pull up,
I got changed.

504
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,240
You said, in your head,
you still pay for it.

505
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:31,280
So I've decided to continue
to take the payment

506
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,120
and balance my heart against my head,

507
00:37:33,160 --> 00:37:35,480
as though it were a book of accounts.

508
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,280
- I value my head a shilling more.
- Huh!

509
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:47,880
When was the last time
you had to worry about shillings, eh?

510
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:52,800
People are loyal to those
who pay their wages.

511
00:37:52,840 --> 00:37:54,680
That's why I'll be loyal to you.

512
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:59,640
But this is the deal.

513
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:02,960
You don't fuck anybody else in my house,

514
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:05,120
nor within a day
of holding our child by the hand.

515
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,720
A day on either side.

516
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,920
And you let me in sometimes.

517
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,080
Into your head.

518
00:38:16,840 --> 00:38:18,280
To clear it out.

519
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,560
That what needs clearing out.

520
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:23,160
Agreed.

521
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:31,760
And this... Always.

522
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:37,280
The deal is... you belong to me.

523
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,840
My property.

524
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:43,400
No-one touches my property.

525
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:49,400
I touch myself, but it's still you anyway.

526
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,960
So that's why I put the phone down.

527
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,920
No, Tom.

528
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,040
We do it in the bed at least.

529
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,720
Everything is mine, Lizzie.

530
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,240
Everything.

531
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:56,200
Arthur.

532
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,880
- Hmm?
- Frances was right.

533
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,560
Linda was here today.

534
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:02,360
Fuck.

535
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,240
What did she say, huh?

536
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,920
- I just want to talk to her, that's all.
- Arthur, listen.

537
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,400
First, I need you to go to Scotland

538
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,200
and bring back Aberama Gold.

539
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,760
Then we'll go and we'll find Linda.

540
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,160
No, no, no, no.

541
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,680
I'll keep calling you, Tom.

542
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,240
You know I will.

543
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,440
I'll call this number back...

544
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,760
again, again and again.

545
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:31,040
If you don't answer,

546
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,480
I'll jump in my fucking car

547
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,760
and I'll drive to your house,
you know I will.

548
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,160
I'll stay there all night if I have to.

549
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,720
I won't go nowhere
- not Scotland -

550
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:45,360
till you tell me what it is you know.

551
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,640
Right, listen to me.

552
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,360
I don't have an address.

553
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:03,000
But she's with the Quakers in Bournville.

554
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:07,400
Apparently,
there is someone who is a Friend.

555
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,240
He had a wife who died
from Spanish flu in 1918.

556
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,880
And he has a daughter.

557
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,840
That should be enough to find him.

558
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,520
Arthur...

559
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:21,800
Just talk to him
and get a message to Linda.

560
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,600
Nothing happened, Arthur.

561
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,600
He's a Quaker, a Friend.

562
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,280
They're not like us, they talk.

563
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,720
Oh, I'll speak to him.

564
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:35,600
Man to man.

565
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,800
And then, after that...

566
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,840
I'll go up north, hmm.

567
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,560
Deal with our business.

568
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,640
I promise you.

569
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,760
Arthur. Arthur, listen to me...

570
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,200
Who were you talking to?

571
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,520
I have to ask you,
cos Maggie at the exchange won't tell me.

572
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,720
Who was it?

573
00:42:09,760 --> 00:42:10,960
Was it Arthur?

574
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,880
I need my brother in one piece.

575
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:17,160
Arthur makes his own decisions.

576
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,480
You marry a Shelby,

577
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,400
you stay fucking married.

578
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,440
Fuck.

579
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:34,320
Well, look at this, hmm.

580
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:35,800
Can I help you?

581
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:38,200
Yeah, I think you can.

582
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,120
I'm looking for Linda Shelby.

583
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,320
Do you know her?

584
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,200
Eh? I'm Arthur.

585
00:42:47,560 --> 00:42:48,600
Her husband.

586
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:52,840
If you're her husband,
she doesn't want to talk to you.

587
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,280
Well, look at you.

588
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,600
Ain't you smart?

589
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:00,640
Eh?

590
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,720
What, you got all the fucking answers,
have you?

591
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:06,400
Well, let's try you with another one. Eh?

592
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,656
Let's try you with another one.

593
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,920
How about...

594
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:13,960
How about we search
for the fucking truth within, hmm?

595
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,120
Let's have a look, eh? Let's have a look.

596
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,840
See what we've got inside here, eh?

597
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:19,920
You fucking bastard!

598
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:29,320
Eh? You wanna keep looking, eh?

599
00:44:13,600 --> 00:44:18,240
Hey, I wanna ask you again.

600
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,640
Eh? Eh?

601
00:44:20,680 --> 00:44:22,800
I'll ask you again.

602
00:44:25,080 --> 00:44:28,000
Where is she? Eh?

603
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:29,680
Where is she?

604
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,640
- Eh? Eh?
- No. No, no, no...

605
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:08,160
I'm a good man.

606
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,680
I'm a fucking good man, like you.

607
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,200
A God-fearing man.

608
00:45:20,840 --> 00:45:22,680
There is good in my heart.

609
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:26,240
There is good in my heart!

610
00:45:32,480 --> 00:45:34,920
But my hands...

611
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,360
These hands belong to the devil.

612
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:41,120
The fucking devil!

613
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:53,160
Wait... Who are you?

614
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:15,120
Did she come back?

615
00:46:16,760 --> 00:46:17,800
No.

616
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:22,720
Is she in Scotland?
Is that why you're going?

617
00:46:22,760 --> 00:46:25,040
No, she's not in fucking Scotland,
Charlie.

618
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,200
Whiskey.

619
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,520
We want whiskey.

620
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,560
Maps.

621
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,040
Cigars.

622
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,640
Load the van, we want it all.

623
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,000
Who's we?

624
00:46:36,040 --> 00:46:37,520
Me and Johnny Dogs.

625
00:46:37,560 --> 00:46:39,480
Ah.

626
00:46:39,520 --> 00:46:42,080
So it's you and Johnny Dogs
against Scotland?

627
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:47,360
You know, at the BSA,
our friends could get you

628
00:46:47,400 --> 00:46:51,040
some of them new artillery cannons
that fire ten shells a second.

629
00:46:51,080 --> 00:46:54,160
You can mount one
on the roof of your fucking car.

630
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,920
Petrol.

631
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:57,000
We need petrol.

632
00:46:57,040 --> 00:47:00,280
It's so far up north,
they run out of the bloody stuff.

633
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:02,720
Yeah.

634
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:06,000
Still riding round on fucking chariots,
they are.

635
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:12,880
Curly, Arthur is going to Scotland,
so he needs hand grenades.

636
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:14,080
How many?

637
00:47:14,120 --> 00:47:16,120
Fuck's sake, it's like it's normal.

638
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:19,040
Our friends at the BSA
still have lots left from the war,

639
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,080
but we can't give them...

640
00:47:21,120 --> 00:47:23,840
Get me some hand grenades, Curly, eh?
Hmm?

641
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:26,880
You find 'em back there, eh?
Good boy, yeah?

642
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,320
You get me some.
Put them on my account.

643
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,640
Yeah.

644
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,560
How many?

645
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:36,720
- Three, Curly.
- Three. Three.

646
00:47:43,240 --> 00:47:45,240
Find a way of getting her back, Arthur.

647
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:50,400
Without her,
you're as good as dead already.

648
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,160
That's them, the Billy Boys!

649
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:40,480
Gentlemen.

650
00:48:40,520 --> 00:48:45,320
You have just crossed the border
into the County of East Tollcross.

651
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:50,160
Now, according
to the unwritten constitution

652
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:51,920
of Tollcross County,

653
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:57,360
Gypsies, Catholics
and other criminally minded individuals

654
00:48:57,400 --> 00:49:00,880
are not allowed to work the roads
of our Protestant district

655
00:49:00,920 --> 00:49:03,440
on account of the poor quality
of their labour.

656
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,400
So, my own boys
will be taking over from here.

657
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,800
We will be needing your tools,

658
00:49:10,840 --> 00:49:13,800
your tar, your burner...

659
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,840
and your transportation.

660
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,320
You're Gypsies,

661
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,960
you can easily steal another.

662
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:24,200
I have the keys to the truck.

663
00:49:50,800 --> 00:49:52,400
Ah!

664
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:17,920
Now...

665
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:23,600
I want you boys to take a message back
to Jimmy McCavern.

666
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:25,360
You killed my son.

667
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,040
You hoisted him on a cross!

668
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,200
Now, in this gun...

669
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:35,760
there's a bullet

670
00:50:35,800 --> 00:50:39,360
and on it is carved the name McCavern.

671
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,480
And when the time comes
for his crucifixion,

672
00:50:46,520 --> 00:50:51,040
it will be me who drives in the nails.

673
00:51:34,440 --> 00:51:36,400
Mr Shelby!

674
00:51:36,440 --> 00:51:38,400
At last you are alone.

675
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,560
I think we'll make quite the team.

676
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,840
The pheasants won't know what hit them.

677
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,640
You're a fine shot, Mr Shelby.

678
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:56,680
You were in the yeomanry, yes?

679
00:51:57,960 --> 00:51:59,760
Were you cavalry?

680
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:02,680
You won the Distinguished Service Medal.

681
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:03,760
That'll help.

682
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:06,040
With what?

683
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:10,000
Two months ago, I was in Rome.

684
00:52:10,040 --> 00:52:11,360
I met Mr Mussolini.

685
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:14,160
You and I and men like him...

686
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,200
we will shape the future.

687
00:52:20,640 --> 00:52:22,560
When will you resign
from the Labour Party?

688
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,200
The day before I announce
the formation of my new party.

689
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:36,040
The British Union of Fascists will be born
on January 1st of next year.

690
00:52:37,160 --> 00:52:38,640
The first day of a new decade.

691
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:44,440
The 1930s, Mr Shelby, will belong to us.

692
00:52:47,360 --> 00:52:48,720
Did you bring that cigar?

693
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:53,320
Before we smoke...

694
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:55,920
I have some conditions.

695
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,680
It really isn't going to be
that kind of relationship.

696
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:07,280
Just smoke like the fine man
you will become.

697
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,120
Yes, Colonel Ben Younger.

698
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:28,080
I have an allocated confidential line -
code 78.

699
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:32,520
It's me.

700
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,440
I've agreed to work with our friend.

701
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,280
He's gonna announce on January 1st.

702
00:53:38,320 --> 00:53:41,400
I need to know that my position
as informant against him

703
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:42,680
is officially sanctioned.

704
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:52,840
Today, gentlemen,

705
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:56,520
we are avenging an unprovoked attack

706
00:53:56,560 --> 00:53:58,960
on members of our organisation

707
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:03,040
who were simply carrying out
a routine border patrol.

708
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,480
Our enemies are Gypsies,

709
00:54:05,520 --> 00:54:10,320
members of a race destined
for natural eradication anyway,

710
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:13,560
due to what the scientists call selection.

711
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:19,200
And since these beggars
are unchristened and unregistered,

712
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,680
the local constabulary
will as soon drop them

713
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:25,560
in a communal grave
as find a name for a gravestone.

714
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:32,280
So proceed in any manner you choose
to find the fugitive we seek.

715
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,560
Morning, Mr Gold.

716
00:54:42,600 --> 00:54:44,480
Yeah.

717
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,520
The Billy Boys are coming for you.

718
00:54:46,560 --> 00:54:48,200
How the fuck did you find me?

719
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:52,280
- How the fuck did they find me?
- I kind of let it slip.

720
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,400
Give you no choice, eh?

721
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,600
What, hmm? What?

722
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,520
And a Bentley outside, the engine running.

723
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:10,000
Fastest engine in the world,
apparently, which is good.

724
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:12,960
We've got two minutes to get out of here.

725
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:35,520
We are officers of
the East Lanarkshire Special Constabulary.

726
00:55:35,560 --> 00:55:39,040
We are seeking a man
by the name of Aberama Gold.

727
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:44,880
Hand the gentleman over,
and no-one else will be harmed.

728
00:56:18,320 --> 00:56:20,920
Fuck! Take cover!

729
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,200
So, Tommy Shelby...

730
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:56,480
it's war you want...

731
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,240
it's war you shall have.
