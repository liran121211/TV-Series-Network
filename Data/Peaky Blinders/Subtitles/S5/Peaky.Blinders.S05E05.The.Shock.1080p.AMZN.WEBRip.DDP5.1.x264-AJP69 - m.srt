00:00:02,468 --> 00:00:04,396
<i>My name is Brilliant Chang.</i>

2
00:00:05,054 --> 00:00:06,532
Mr Thomas...

3
00:00:07,953 --> 00:00:12,304
..it is the purest opium
that has ever arrived in Europe.

4
00:00:12,447 --> 00:00:15,702
Came off a ship called the Capital,
out of Shanghai.

5
00:00:15,939 --> 00:00:18,412
This is a gift, Mr Shelby.

6
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:21,798
Canals are the idea,
right, Chang?

7
00:00:22,054 --> 00:00:25,656
I believe we've friends in common.
We should postpone our war.

8
00:00:25,744 --> 00:00:27,656
Your message said
you wanted to seal

9
00:00:27,744 --> 00:00:28,931
our truce
with some business.

10
00:00:29,019 --> 00:00:32,492
I'm involved in a transaction
with Jimmy McCavern.

11
00:00:32,586 --> 00:00:35,416
I need your signature as a guarantor
on the transaction

12
00:00:35,504 --> 00:00:37,673
should his cheque fail
to be honoured.

13
00:00:38,245 --> 00:00:41,198
The war with the Billy Boys is postponed.
We've made peace.

14
00:00:41,286 --> 00:00:43,212
We're gonna do business
together.

15
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,408
<i>There's a part of me
that is unfamiliar to</i> myself

16
00:00:47,511 --> 00:00:49,328
<i>and I keep finding myself there.</i>

17
00:00:49,432 --> 00:00:51,697
<i>And only the January
can get me away.</i>

18
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:02,468
His name was Frederick.
All we ever did was talk, Arthur.

19
00:01:02,632 --> 00:01:06,445
He just listened.
And now he has no face.

20
00:01:08,117 --> 00:01:10,460
May you Peaky Blinders all rot...

21

23
00:01:21,571 --> 00:01:23,967
- Clear that shit. Clear it!
- All right.

24
00:01:24,055 --> 00:01:25,601
Take her.

25
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:42,703
Go outside. Till it's done.
Till it's done, brother.

26
00:01:47,423 --> 00:01:50,912
Linda, I would have taken your bullet.

27
00:01:51,335 --> 00:01:52,848
I deserved the bullet.

28
00:01:52,945 --> 00:01:55,708
An eye for an eye
and a tooth for a tooth!

29
00:01:57,866 --> 00:01:58,939
Linda!

30
00:01:59,027 --> 00:02:00,260
Linda, look at me.

31
00:02:00,354 --> 00:02:02,232
Linda, you've got a kid.

32
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,630
If you die,
he'll come to us to raise.

33
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:06,091
You hear me?

34
00:02:07,617 --> 00:02:09,083
I used a derringer.

35
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:10,568
- Shh!
- Right.

36
00:02:10,656 --> 00:02:12,021
- Shh!
- It's still in there.

37
00:02:12,268 --> 00:02:13,607
It's above the bone.

38
00:02:13,695 --> 00:02:15,435
Mr Shelby, your guests.

39
00:02:15,523 --> 00:02:16,708
Get him out.
Arthur!

40
00:02:16,796 --> 00:02:19,156
Family only.
Get him out!

41
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,708
- Mr Shelby...
- Get out!

42
00:02:24,112 --> 00:02:25,872
Get out!

43
00:02:26,311 --> 00:02:30,693
Lizzie, go to the kitchen
and get some iodine. Now! Go!

44
00:02:32,109 --> 00:02:35,194
Shh... shh...

45
00:02:36,135 --> 00:02:37,408
Linda...

46
00:02:37,496 --> 00:02:38,474
You'll have to bite on this.

47
00:02:38,562 --> 00:02:41,298
- Linda... Arthur.
- Bite! Come here.

48
00:02:41,386 --> 00:02:43,912
Now, it's really gonna hurt.

49
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,930
One, two, three...

50
00:02:54,753 --> 00:02:56,672
You're all right. You're all right.

51
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,766
- It's all over.
- Hold her.

52
00:03:06,710 --> 00:03:10,563
Is she going to be all right, Tom?
Is she going to be all right, Tom?

53
00:03:10,651 --> 00:03:11,633
Yeah.

54
00:03:11,721 --> 00:03:12,586
Oh, Jesus.

55
00:03:12,681 --> 00:03:14,296
Arthur, come here. Come here.

56
00:03:14,547 --> 00:03:17,750
If you love her, go to the library,
get some opium.

57
00:03:17,838 --> 00:03:20,969
- Go on. She'll be fine. Go sort it.
- Right.

58
00:03:25,044 --> 00:03:28,570
Actually, you can use mine.

59
00:03:33,089 --> 00:03:37,219
Brought a bit to celebrate
the wedding proposal.

60
00:03:38,003 --> 00:03:40,688
Oh! He proposed, eh?

61
00:03:42,781 --> 00:03:44,453
One knee.

62
00:03:45,075 --> 00:03:47,227
Congratulations, Poll.

63
00:03:47,828 --> 00:03:49,156
Linda...

64
00:03:49,244 --> 00:03:50,664
Linda...

65
00:03:50,836 --> 00:03:52,211
- You're gonna have to drink this.
- No.

66
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:53,936
- I don't want anything you've touched.
- 25 seconds.

67
00:03:54,024 --> 00:03:57,013
 25 seconds
and the pain will be gone.

68
00:03:57,101 --> 00:03:58,844
Even the pain in your head.

69
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:00,844
Right, here you go. Drink.

70
00:04:06,973 --> 00:04:08,213
Cushion, Poll.

71
00:04:12,096 --> 00:04:13,719
Right.

72
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:21,201
Oh, Jesus Christ...

73
00:04:21,289 --> 00:04:22,880
Arthur...

74
00:04:22,968 --> 00:04:24,561
She's gonna be fine.

75
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:28,094
I gave her something
to get her to sleep.

76
00:04:28,182 --> 00:04:29,462
She's gonna be fine.

77
00:04:32,243 --> 00:04:35,711
You should have... You should have
let her do it, Poll.

78
00:04:36,394 --> 00:04:38,434
You should have let her do it.

79
00:04:40,033 --> 00:04:41,460
Arthur...

80
00:04:42,313 --> 00:04:43,578
You should have let her do it.

81
00:04:43,674 --> 00:04:45,758
Look at me, brother!
Look at me!

82
00:04:46,461 --> 00:04:47,901
You've got things to do.

83
00:04:48,136 --> 00:04:49,649
You've got a kid.

84
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,961
- Yeah.
- We need you!

85
00:04:51,049 --> 00:04:53,322
- All right? You understand?
- Yeah.

86
00:04:53,495 --> 00:04:55,797
Aberama wants you as best man.

87
00:04:56,447 --> 00:04:57,781
You hear that?

88
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:03,602
I save his life, he hugs him.

89
00:05:05,902 --> 00:05:07,149
Oh...

90
00:05:08,901 --> 00:05:10,454
I'll do it.

91
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:12,119
No take.

92
00:05:12,465 --> 00:05:15,356
- Right, fine.
- Let him be. Let him be.

93
00:05:24,467 --> 00:05:26,560
Ladies and gentlemen...

94
00:05:27,826 --> 00:05:29,599
Ladies and gentlemen...

95
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,670
..I would like to extend our gratitude
to the musicians

96
00:05:34,771 --> 00:05:38,052
and the dance company
for your wonderful performance.

97
00:05:38,208 --> 00:05:39,747
Hear hear!

98
00:05:39,835 --> 00:05:43,279
This has been
a wonderful evening.

99
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:47,052
And not only
for the music and the dancing.

100
00:05:47,464 --> 00:05:51,709
It has also been about us,
the people gathered here.

101
00:05:52,538 --> 00:05:56,045
English people
in the very heart of England.

102
00:05:57,694 --> 00:06:00,021
There are no people
I would rather be among,

103
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:04,502
no place I would rather be
and no time I would rather be alive,

104
00:06:04,944 --> 00:06:07,560
because ever since
the terrible events of October,

105
00:06:07,648 --> 00:06:10,261
when the money markets
betrayed us all...

106
00:06:11,218 --> 00:06:15,098
..I have known that change is coming.

107
00:06:17,204 --> 00:06:22,637
The human species has never faced
such... immense possibilities,

108
00:06:22,703 --> 00:06:23,903
such choices.

109
00:06:25,372 --> 00:06:28,107
In the lives of great nations...

110
00:06:29,168 --> 00:06:32,154
..there are moments of destiny...

111
00:06:32,861 --> 00:06:36,657
..which have swept aside
small men of convention

112
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:39,681
and discovered men of the moment.

113
00:06:39,769 --> 00:06:44,139
- <i>Hear hear!</i>
- And our host is such a man.

114
00:06:45,956 --> 00:06:47,629
For him...

115
00:06:47,859 --> 00:06:52,678
For him, the little calculations
of little men mean nothing.

116
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:58,186
He is a man well suited to
the mighty mood that England is now in.

117
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:03,288
The only reason I say this now,

118
00:07:03,431 --> 00:07:06,544
at this moment, on this stage,

119
00:07:07,108 --> 00:07:09,748
is because I have some news.

120
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,686
Good news, I think.

121
00:07:14,949 --> 00:07:17,780
I'm sure our host will forgive me
if I use this platform,

122
00:07:17,868 --> 00:07:20,664
this gathering of
friends and like minds,

123
00:07:20,932 --> 00:07:23,522
to give you,
his trusted allies,

124
00:07:23,702 --> 00:07:26,342
an early announcement
of a long-overdue event.

125
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:30,295
I want to tell you good folk first...

126
00:07:31,007 --> 00:07:33,373
..that with the dawn of a new decade...

127
00:07:34,577 --> 00:07:37,050
..I will be setting a new course.

128
00:07:37,395 --> 00:07:42,623
Setting up a new political movement
here in the very heart of England.

129
00:07:43,134 --> 00:07:45,248
And Mr Shelby will be with me,

130
00:07:45,336 --> 00:07:46,905
shoulder to shoulder.

131
00:07:46,993 --> 00:07:48,553
<i>Hear hear!</i>

132
00:07:50,502 --> 00:07:54,653
It will offer
a new conception of politics

133
00:07:54,741 --> 00:07:56,799
in which the great character
of the British,

134
00:07:56,887 --> 00:07:59,240
our true character,

135
00:07:59,615 --> 00:08:01,299
will be reborn.

136
00:08:08,213 --> 00:08:11,766
Many of you lost fortunes
in the recent stock market crash.

137
00:08:12,313 --> 00:08:14,119
The men of money,

138
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:16,962
the capitalists in New York,

139
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,220
the Jews...

140
00:08:19,911 --> 00:08:23,221
..the money-power, they... they run
an international system

141
00:08:23,309 --> 00:08:25,142
in which the infinite mobility of money,

142
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:29,252
its capacity to create financial chaos
and panic,

143
00:08:29,518 --> 00:08:34,352
can bring down any government
that dares for one moment to oppose it.

144
00:08:35,704 --> 00:08:40,057
For generations,
the efforts of hard-working men like you

145
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,613
have equipped
our competitors against us.

146
00:08:43,701 --> 00:08:45,151
The cotton mills of India.

147
00:08:45,239 --> 00:08:46,872
The cotton mills of Asia.

148
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,315
Created with British money

149
00:08:49,403 --> 00:08:52,911
but used for the destruction
of Lancashire and Yorkshire!

150
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,018
<i>Disgraceful!</i>

151
00:08:54,253 --> 00:08:59,039
The usurers of New York,
the sweated labour of the Orient

152
00:08:59,127 --> 00:09:02,963
combining to destroy
the iron and steel factories

153
00:09:03,051 --> 00:09:05,307
of Warwickshire and Staffordshire.

154
00:09:05,395 --> 00:09:09,793
These are policies that could not
be pursued by British statesmen

155
00:09:09,881 --> 00:09:14,434
unless they were mad
or the servants of Jewish finance!

156
00:09:16,434 --> 00:09:19,450
They are the ones who took your money,

157
00:09:19,538 --> 00:09:22,489
but it is I and those who know this truth

158
00:09:22,864 --> 00:09:26,926
who will light a flame
the atheists cannot extinguish!

159
00:09:36,414 --> 00:09:39,465
The ranks of our heroes
of the Great War

160
00:09:39,553 --> 00:09:44,262
have been betrayed
again and again by politicians!

161
00:09:44,616 --> 00:09:49,621
But hear this - those of you who fought
the Jew war for nothing,

162
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,754
you brave men,

163
00:09:51,842 --> 00:09:55,418
you will join hands
with the angry youth of Birmingham

164
00:09:55,506 --> 00:09:59,088
and Manchester and London
and Liverpool

165
00:09:59,176 --> 00:10:02,700
and declare that
England lives tonight

166
00:10:02,788 --> 00:10:04,988
and marches on!

167
00:10:06,449 --> 00:10:07,482
Well said!

168
00:10:07,726 --> 00:10:10,043
I say all this to you now...

169
00:10:10,587 --> 00:10:12,450
..because I believe
it is in places like this,

170
00:10:12,538 --> 00:10:16,825
with people like you, that we will have
to pass on our message directly.

171
00:10:17,160 --> 00:10:19,993
Our message can be summarised
with these words...

172
00:10:20,534 --> 00:10:22,647
Britain first.

173
00:10:28,419 --> 00:10:30,892
And because this is our message,

174
00:10:31,152 --> 00:10:33,879
I doubt it'll be reported
fairly in the press.

175
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:37,090
I'm afraid the newspapers of this country

176
00:10:37,472 --> 00:10:42,432
are owned by the same vested interests
who took your money.

177
00:10:43,483 --> 00:10:45,989
They sell to the people false news...

178
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,960
..to raise the interests of the faction
and the section

179
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:51,161
above the interests of the nation.

180
00:10:51,474 --> 00:10:54,347
- <i>Good man!</i>
- So hear my words

181
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:57,538
and pass them on
to those with ears to hear.

182
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:02,491
And be reminded
that when the new decade begins,

183
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:06,207
there will be the birth
of a new political party

184
00:11:06,295 --> 00:11:08,208
which will speak for you.

185
00:11:10,385 --> 00:11:12,263
<i>- Well said, sir.
- Well said!</i>

186
00:11:12,351 --> 00:11:17,169
This party, this new movement,
this revolution...

187
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,801
..will be called
the British Union of Fascists.

188
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:24,761
Bravo!

189
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:38,466
Good man!

190
00:11:38,585 --> 00:11:41,466
What the fuck are you doing,
dealing with a man like that, Tommy?

191
00:11:42,518 --> 00:11:45,391
Yep.
You're going to have to trust me.

192
00:11:45,479 --> 00:11:46,667
Again.

193
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,956
I'm going to fuck the swan.

194
00:11:57,845 --> 00:12:00,478
Somebody go and tell her
to come to my room.

195
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:02,831
How do you know she'll come?

196
00:12:04,528 --> 00:12:06,441
Because they always do.

197
00:12:17,786 --> 00:12:19,579
Now, forgive me.

198
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:22,449
I'm going to borrow your husband
for a little while.

199
00:12:23,518 --> 00:12:25,050
This way.

200
00:12:28,382 --> 00:12:33,695
Things like tonight, that shooting,
a family dispute in public,

201
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:36,520
things like that will have to stop.

202
00:12:36,724 --> 00:12:38,477
It's very lower class.

203
00:12:39,048 --> 00:12:41,368
It's all been cleared up,
Mr Mosley.

204
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:53,165
So, did you learn anything
from my speech tonight?

205
00:12:53,775 --> 00:12:54,884
Yes.

206
00:12:54,979 --> 00:12:56,906
Yes, I learned many things.

207
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,978
Religion was a beast,
but it's dead.

208
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:03,423
You have to ride the new thing
when it comes.

209
00:13:03,853 --> 00:13:05,384
Like a horse.

210
00:13:06,056 --> 00:13:07,532
You grab it.

211
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,431
I looked into the audience
and I saw medals

212
00:13:12,611 --> 00:13:14,604
and Savile Row suits,

213
00:13:14,692 --> 00:13:15,972
and bitterness.

214
00:13:17,507 --> 00:13:20,821
They are my people.
Your people will be different.

215
00:13:23,757 --> 00:13:26,556
Oh, do see the funny side, Shelby.

216
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,240
I do.

217
00:13:31,738 --> 00:13:33,556
I do see the funny side.

218
00:13:39,781 --> 00:13:41,574
Do you enjoy strategies?

219
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,946
Yes, I do.

220
00:13:44,636 --> 00:13:46,949
Things will begin to happen now.

221
00:13:47,037 --> 00:13:48,237
So...

222
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:51,791
...there are some things
we need to discuss.

223
00:13:52,465 --> 00:13:54,813
I've been looking
into your companies.

224
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,493
The Shelby portfolio.

225
00:13:58,155 --> 00:14:00,628
Your company lawyer is a Jew.

226
00:14:01,051 --> 00:14:02,782
He will have to go.

227
00:14:04,452 --> 00:14:05,711
Of course.

228
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:09,407
Also, our friend Jimmy McCavern

229
00:14:09,797 --> 00:14:13,532
has asked for control of the racecourses
north of Wincanton.

230
00:14:13,674 --> 00:14:16,997
I decided it is a trifling thing,
considering our new enterprise,

231
00:14:17,085 --> 00:14:19,891
so I said yes.

232
00:14:22,526 --> 00:14:24,839
In return for what?

233
00:14:25,754 --> 00:14:27,514
No return.

234
00:14:30,512 --> 00:14:31,872
None.

235
00:14:34,111 --> 00:14:38,544
When our campaign begins, the country
will be divided into distinct areas.

236
00:14:38,632 --> 00:14:41,344
McCavern and his men
will be our soldiers in the north,

237
00:14:41,534 --> 00:14:44,566
controlling rallies
and breaking up demonstrations.

238
00:14:44,654 --> 00:14:47,285
In the Midlands, it'll be you.

239
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:52,080
The south... Well, I have yet to decide.

240
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:58,143
Please understand what I'm offering you
as we go forward, Mr Shelby.

241
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:03,386
When we succeed,
even the King will not be above us.

242
00:15:09,633 --> 00:15:10,873
Power.

243
00:15:12,319 --> 00:15:14,811
Like plugging into the mains.

244
00:15:15,605 --> 00:15:17,343
A lighthouse beam.

245
00:15:18,356 --> 00:15:21,577
Your millions of dollars
safe in Switzerland,

246
00:15:22,052 --> 00:15:25,652
and access to every dirty-minded swan
in England.

247
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:35,429
Oh, and also, Shelby... drink less.

248
00:16:21,049 --> 00:16:22,769
Put it on.

249
00:16:25,587 --> 00:16:28,507
Put the costume back on.

250
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,180
The ballerina and I were wondering
whether perhaps...

251
00:17:04,309 --> 00:17:06,222
..you might want to join us.

252
00:17:06,482 --> 00:17:08,875
If I told Tommy,
you wouldn't see the morning.

253
00:17:09,032 --> 00:17:11,307
Oh, I doubt that very much.

254
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:15,987
You see, he is being seduced,
just as you were.

255
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,480
Tommy.

256
00:17:34,347 --> 00:17:35,907
Tommy!

257
00:17:36,401 --> 00:17:39,400
- Tom!
- What?

258
00:17:39,675 --> 00:17:42,495
Lizzie... What?!

259
00:17:44,614 --> 00:17:47,025
Tommy, I swear to God, you're bad.

260
00:17:47,196 --> 00:17:49,151
That man is fucking evil.

261
00:17:49,297 --> 00:17:50,497
Lizzie...

262
00:17:51,756 --> 00:17:53,389
I'm only doing this...

263
00:17:54,196 --> 00:17:55,909
...to bring the bastard down.

264
00:17:56,027 --> 00:17:57,659
Yeah, but why?

265
00:17:59,091 --> 00:18:01,169
Tommy? Why?

266
00:18:02,446 --> 00:18:05,169
I am supplying the British Government

267
00:18:05,437 --> 00:18:09,021
with information
on his organisation,

268
00:18:09,109 --> 00:18:14,502
and in return, they are giving me
favourable terms on defence contracts.

269
00:18:14,831 --> 00:18:16,231
No.

270
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:19,263
You're doing it because you think
somebody should stop him.

271
00:18:19,718 --> 00:18:22,122
I saw your face
when he was speaking.

272
00:18:23,444 --> 00:18:26,224
You're doing it because you think
it's the right thing to do.

273
00:18:26,643 --> 00:18:29,404
All this time, you just did things
that feel nice...

274
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,583
...because you can afford it.

275
00:18:30,671 --> 00:18:33,631
Lizzie, please. Please.
Please stop.

276
00:18:36,184 --> 00:18:37,763
Don't scare me...

277
00:18:38,808 --> 00:18:41,608
..by saying you see things in my face.

278
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:45,423
I still want things that feel nice.

279
00:19:06,406 --> 00:19:08,069
Linda...

280
00:19:09,376 --> 00:19:10,856
Shh. Shh.

281
00:19:15,497 --> 00:19:16,977
Linda...

282
00:19:18,095 --> 00:19:19,368
Let's go.

283
00:19:19,456 --> 00:19:20,489
Hmm?

284
00:19:21,371 --> 00:19:23,331
Let's go, let's leave.

285
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:27,381
Let's get in the car.
We'll go and pick up Billy.

286
00:19:28,759 --> 00:19:30,712
We'll drive to the docks.

287
00:19:31,251 --> 00:19:33,053
Any dock you want.

288
00:19:35,247 --> 00:19:36,760
We'll get on a boat.

289
00:19:37,018 --> 00:19:38,571
We'll sail away.

290
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:39,979
You and me.

291
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,920
Any destination.

292
00:19:50,162 --> 00:19:51,795
Be careful, it's...

293
00:19:52,515 --> 00:19:54,459
It's broken everywhere.

294
00:19:56,782 --> 00:19:58,902
We leave tonight. Hmm?

295
00:20:00,681 --> 00:20:02,474
We'd leave this place.

296
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,787
We never come back, Linda.

297
00:20:05,648 --> 00:20:07,208
We never come back.

298
00:20:08,883 --> 00:20:10,483
I mean that.

299
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:15,740
We go before it gets light.

300
00:20:18,069 --> 00:20:19,429
Say yes.

301
00:20:21,124 --> 00:20:23,076
I've got a better idea.

302
00:20:26,534 --> 00:20:28,256
You stay here...

303
00:20:29,673 --> 00:20:32,084
..living inside your head.

304
00:20:33,237 --> 00:20:35,944
Inside your life.
Inside your war.

305
00:20:44,033 --> 00:20:46,753
I'm glad
I didn't shoot you.

306
00:20:50,913 --> 00:20:53,033
It would have been a kindness.

307
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:03,811
Now get out.

308
00:21:06,091 --> 00:21:07,246
Please...

309
00:22:20,357 --> 00:22:23,357
An evening with a bunch
of fucking Gypsies.

310
00:22:49,728 --> 00:22:51,954
Peter! Peter! Kick it here!

311
00:22:57,952 --> 00:22:59,752
Kick it here, mister!

312
00:23:08,455 --> 00:23:12,079
This is a cheque guarantee,
signed by Mosley...

313
00:23:12,926 --> 00:23:16,227
..on behalf of a man
called Jimmy McCavern.

314
00:23:16,496 --> 00:23:17,610
A cheque for what?

315
00:23:17,698 --> 00:23:21,055
Well, I said it was
for the sale of a gin distillery.

316
00:23:21,598 --> 00:23:23,238
But it doesn't matter.

317
00:23:24,133 --> 00:23:27,072
It is direct evidence of a link
between Mosley

318
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,844
and the head
of an organised criminal network.

319
00:23:30,257 --> 00:23:33,697
A relationship he will try to deny...

320
00:23:34,427 --> 00:23:36,707
..after the bonfire of all conventions.

321
00:23:37,694 --> 00:23:40,927
It also contains the names of MPs
who have signed up to the movement,

322
00:23:41,241 --> 00:23:43,727
and those MPs
who are sympathetic

323
00:23:43,815 --> 00:23:46,610
but will not show
their hand until the organisation...

324
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:48,872
is announced officially.

325
00:23:49,337 --> 00:23:51,290
On 2nd January.

326
00:23:52,242 --> 00:23:54,902
In Grosvenor House. You might want
to write some of this down.

327
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:58,579
I am experiencing resistance
from my superior officers too.

328
00:24:02,826 --> 00:24:05,266
This isn't intelligence, Younger.

329
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:07,722
This is evidence.

330
00:24:08,168 --> 00:24:09,337
Give it to the Branch.

331
00:24:09,425 --> 00:24:10,698
Special Branch?

332
00:24:10,854 --> 00:24:13,751
Half of whom spend their lives
defending the Union against Fenians,

333
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:15,126
and the other half
who spend their lives

334
00:24:15,214 --> 00:24:17,641
defending men like Mosley
against socialists.

335
00:24:17,729 --> 00:24:20,391
I heard about his speech
at your house the other night.

336
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:23,228
Was favourably reported as
the passionate

337
00:24:23,316 --> 00:24:27,789
and spontaneous outpouring of a man
moved by the emotions of a ballet.

338
00:24:27,877 --> 00:24:28,993
Reported where?

339
00:24:29,081 --> 00:24:31,352
Daily Mail. Morning Post.
Daily Mirror.

340
00:24:31,812 --> 00:24:34,383
It's upper, middle
and working class,

341
00:24:34,471 --> 00:24:36,671
all united in admiration.

342
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:43,251
Also, I'm being asked the source
of my information on Mosley.

343
00:24:43,664 --> 00:24:45,017
Which you don't divulge?

344
00:24:45,105 --> 00:24:46,305
No.

345
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:50,360
And as a result, my six-monthly review
was unfavourable.

346
00:24:51,626 --> 00:24:55,227
They're talking about moving me to
a black and coloured desk in Johannesburg.

347
00:24:56,782 --> 00:25:00,540
I also suspect there are
specific threats to me personally

348
00:25:01,055 --> 00:25:04,120
from an organisation called Section D.

349
00:25:04,459 --> 00:25:07,040
I believe you've had a dispute
with them in the past.

350
00:25:08,788 --> 00:25:10,188
Sit down, Younger.

351
00:25:19,141 --> 00:25:20,461
Yeech...

352
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:27,315
We are now Section D.

353
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,770
And I fucking beat them.

354
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:34,782
You're a soldier, I'm a soldier.

355
00:25:35,025 --> 00:25:39,946
There are elements within the state
who are prepared to kill.

356
00:25:40,313 --> 00:25:43,149
We need to meet them unafraid.

357
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,680
Spoken like a true believer.

358
00:25:50,266 --> 00:25:53,454
My superiors also ask why
the information on Jessie Eden

359
00:25:53,542 --> 00:25:55,946
and the Communists
has apparently dried up.

360
00:25:57,398 --> 00:25:59,688
Why has it dried up, Mr Shelby?

361
00:26:00,897 --> 00:26:02,970
Your sister has an interesting theory.

362
00:26:03,268 --> 00:26:05,710
She thinks
perhaps at last

363
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:09,180
Tommy Shelby has actually started
to believe in something.

364
00:26:20,718 --> 00:26:22,278
Younger.

365
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:26,563
Please don't listen
to my sister's opinions of me.

366
00:26:26,909 --> 00:26:30,172
They are always... hopeful.

367
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:34,188
Therefore they are always wrong.

368
00:28:12,746 --> 00:28:14,219
Can you hear me? Look at me.

369
00:28:14,306 --> 00:28:16,339
You're going to be all right.
I'll be back.

370
00:28:16,426 --> 00:28:17,659
You'll be OK.

371
00:28:17,746 --> 00:28:19,219
Look at me. Look at me.

372
00:28:19,306 --> 00:28:20,546
It's OK.

373
00:28:26,108 --> 00:28:27,308
Fuck!

374
00:28:27,847 --> 00:28:29,200
Call an ambulance!

375
00:28:29,318 --> 00:28:30,526
Call Moss!

376
00:28:30,614 --> 00:28:32,784
Find out where I can reach Ada.
Come on, love.

377
00:28:32,946 --> 00:28:34,459
Up you get. Good girl.

378
00:28:34,685 --> 00:28:36,565
Come on, take her. Take her.

379
00:28:37,345 --> 00:28:40,909
Come on. Up you get. Up you get.
Good boy.

380
00:28:41,226 --> 00:28:42,419
Come on.

381
00:28:42,631 --> 00:28:45,166
In you go. Inside. Stay inside.

382
00:29:38,252 --> 00:29:40,125
Tommy?

383
00:29:40,213 --> 00:29:41,618
Let's sit down, Ada.

384
00:29:41,706 --> 00:29:42,986
What's happened?

385
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:46,838
Here, sit down, eh?

386
00:29:57,322 --> 00:29:59,202
Ben Younger is dead.

387
00:30:02,129 --> 00:30:04,049
Someone put a bomb in his car.

388
00:30:07,685 --> 00:30:12,165
I don't know how you felt about him
or how bad this is gonna hurt...

389
00:30:13,706 --> 00:30:16,626
...but whatever happens, just remember
you've a baby inside of you.

390
00:30:21,537 --> 00:30:23,257
Oh, God.

391
00:30:24,555 --> 00:30:26,915
Anyone you touch...

392
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:30,166
Which means anyone I touch.

393
00:30:31,309 --> 00:30:33,588
Which means anyone any of us touch.

394
00:30:34,822 --> 00:30:36,994
He never knew I was pregnant.

395
00:30:37,617 --> 00:30:39,137
I hadn't told him.

396
00:30:41,226 --> 00:30:42,948
I didn't love him.

397
00:30:45,119 --> 00:30:46,559
But I liked him.

398
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,738
He was decent and good...

399
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:57,026
I wasn't gonna marry him.

400
00:30:59,771 --> 00:31:02,291
The baby was a mistake,
but that's OK.

401
00:31:04,593 --> 00:31:08,549
I didn't ask anything of him.

402
00:31:10,131 --> 00:31:12,611
God, he didn't deserve us.

403
00:31:16,545 --> 00:31:20,505
Well, I've spoken to his family -
they're gonna take care of the funeral.

404
00:31:21,941 --> 00:31:26,408
It will go down as an IRA assassination
of a British military officer.

405
00:31:29,106 --> 00:31:31,146
And what was it really?

406
00:31:36,146 --> 00:31:37,626
It was...

407
00:31:38,918 --> 00:31:41,291
...a consequence of good intentions.

408
00:31:42,008 --> 00:31:43,688
My good intentions.

409
00:31:45,968 --> 00:31:49,688
I pushed him to report on the fascists.
I thought it was the right thing to do.

410
00:31:51,032 --> 00:31:55,105
And as a result,
Section D or the Branch or Intelligence

411
00:31:55,261 --> 00:31:56,661
had him killed.

412
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:11,979
There was a kid...

413
00:32:12,565 --> 00:32:14,226
..died in the explosion.

414
00:32:15,102 --> 00:32:16,861
He was ten years old.

415
00:32:18,739 --> 00:32:20,219
It's funny...

416
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:23,506
...isn't it, how it works?

417
00:32:26,346 --> 00:32:27,940
Look, Tommy.

418
00:32:30,150 --> 00:32:32,611
Don't give yourself this excuse.

419
00:32:37,164 --> 00:32:39,044
He was ten years old.

420
00:32:40,346 --> 00:32:42,459
If I'd have stuck to what I do,

421
00:32:43,236 --> 00:32:45,473
he'd still be kicking a ball
in the street.

422
00:32:48,329 --> 00:32:49,609
It's funny, isn't it?

423
00:33:47,183 --> 00:33:48,783
Push the button.

424
00:33:49,579 --> 00:33:52,158
Unlock the door and
come home to me.

425
00:34:15,884 --> 00:34:18,869
Chinese lanterns. Brass on deck.

426
00:34:20,788 --> 00:34:22,708
God fucking help us.

427
00:34:54,337 --> 00:34:57,170
Chang will be waiting at the dock
with the cargo.

428
00:34:57,430 --> 00:35:00,110
We weigh it,
we load it, we fuck off.

429
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:17,644
Where the fuck is Chang?

430
00:35:25,577 --> 00:35:27,217
Isiah, take point.

431
00:35:28,058 --> 00:35:29,957
Look lively.

432
00:35:32,246 --> 00:35:34,739
Right, there's your lanterns.

433
00:35:35,104 --> 00:35:37,266
Where the fuck are the Chinese?

434
00:35:37,354 --> 00:35:38,550
All right, Charlie.

435
00:35:39,736 --> 00:35:41,976
Arthur, it's Chang!

436
00:35:42,644 --> 00:35:44,204
Christ!

437
00:35:46,398 --> 00:35:48,984
Get over!
Get over. Get over!

438
00:35:49,726 --> 00:35:53,742
I knew we shouldn't trust these fuckers
and their fucking lanterns.

439
00:36:00,031 --> 00:36:02,234
If it's the police, hold fire.

440
00:36:02,336 --> 00:36:04,698
Chang, where's the stuff?
Where is it?

441
00:36:04,786 --> 00:36:07,297
They didn't look like police.
Smelt of gin.

442
00:36:07,385 --> 00:36:10,578
They said they were taking the opium
on behalf of the King.

443
00:36:10,666 --> 00:36:12,299
Then they saw your boat coming.

444
00:36:12,387 --> 00:36:14,258
So, were they Italian?

445
00:36:14,554 --> 00:36:15,859
- Were they Italian?
- Irish.

446
00:36:15,947 --> 00:36:17,625
Irish, I think...

447
00:36:18,064 --> 00:36:19,457
Oh, fuck.

448
00:36:19,545 --> 00:36:21,978
Fuck! Charlie,

449
00:36:22,066 --> 00:36:23,555
my gun. Give me the gun.

450
00:36:23,643 --> 00:36:24,739
Give it up, that's it.

451
00:36:24,826 --> 00:36:26,500
Listen. Listen to me.

452
00:36:26,588 --> 00:36:28,852
They're Titanic boys out there, right?

453
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:30,579
They're out of Poplar.

454
00:36:30,666 --> 00:36:33,139
In the war, they were very capable.

455
00:36:33,226 --> 00:36:35,059
Very capable soldiers.

456
00:36:35,146 --> 00:36:36,899
So was I.

457
00:36:36,986 --> 00:36:39,841
I was a fucking
capable soldier, too.

458
00:36:40,154 --> 00:36:44,208
Hey! Hey, you fucking bastards!

459
00:37:03,246 --> 00:37:04,618
Arthur! Arthur!

460
00:37:04,706 --> 00:37:07,747
Stop firing! Arthur, they've gone.

461
00:37:12,242 --> 00:37:14,599
To any of you still alive,

462
00:37:15,012 --> 00:37:17,058
you do not fuck

463
00:37:17,449 --> 00:37:21,864
with the Peaky fucking Blinders!

464
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,111
Huh!

465
00:37:47,591 --> 00:37:48,911
Yeah.

466
00:37:52,322 --> 00:37:53,775
Here we go.

467
00:38:02,227 --> 00:38:03,587
Chang?

468
00:38:07,895 --> 00:38:09,363
Purest ever in Europe.

469
00:38:09,451 --> 00:38:10,644
Arthur?

470
00:38:10,732 --> 00:38:12,875
There's a dead man
in a copper's uniform.

471
00:38:13,162 --> 00:38:14,722
Should I throw him in the cut?

472
00:38:15,753 --> 00:38:17,066
No.

473
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:19,353
No, he'll float, won't he, eh?

474
00:38:19,526 --> 00:38:21,766
Even Irishmen fucking float.

475
00:38:22,644 --> 00:38:26,477
No, go and fire... go and fire the kilns.

476
00:38:26,783 --> 00:38:28,663
But there are men working them.

477
00:38:29,728 --> 00:38:33,288
Why do you carry a gun, Isiah, eh?

478
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,296
And razor blades in your cap?

479
00:38:37,146 --> 00:38:40,241
Cos you're a Peaky fucking Blinder,
that's why.

480
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:43,718
You take that body
and you burn it to the bone.

481
00:38:44,033 --> 00:38:47,109
And if anybody speaks to you on that...

482
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:50,937
...you offer them the chance
to burn in that furnace with him.

483
00:38:51,818 --> 00:38:53,091
Right?

484
00:38:53,405 --> 00:38:54,565
Yes, Arthur.

485
00:38:56,141 --> 00:38:59,018
Yeah. Yeah.

486
00:38:59,416 --> 00:39:01,830
Do we know the people
who tried to trick us?

487
00:39:01,982 --> 00:39:03,215
The uncles will be mad.

488
00:39:03,303 --> 00:39:04,955
Fuck your uncles.

489
00:39:05,043 --> 00:39:07,633
And your aunts, your cousins,
all of them, right?

490
00:39:08,717 --> 00:39:13,820
Curly! Load this up onto the boat.
Let's get back to Birmingham, eh?

491
00:39:14,078 --> 00:39:16,406
Get back to fucking civilisation

492
00:39:16,494 --> 00:39:18,527
and find out who's been talking.

493
00:39:18,615 --> 00:39:20,328
Yeah! Now look,

494
00:39:20,438 --> 00:39:22,751
the Titanic heard about this, right?

495
00:39:22,839 --> 00:39:27,344
That means every gang from Poplar
to Birmingham will want to be here.

496
00:39:28,826 --> 00:39:30,619
Well, let 'em come, eh?

497
00:39:30,867 --> 00:39:32,992
Let 'em come, Aberama.

498
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:34,433
Yeah.

499
00:39:34,583 --> 00:39:36,623
Oh, let 'em fucking come!

500
00:41:10,783 --> 00:41:12,543
Hat and coat off.

501
00:41:24,423 --> 00:41:26,503
Stand up against the wall.

502
00:41:30,484 --> 00:41:33,597
For your own safety,
I need to search you

503
00:41:33,730 --> 00:41:37,435
for items that could potentially
be used as weapons against you.

504
00:41:54,781 --> 00:41:56,572
Oh, that's nice.

505
00:42:15,901 --> 00:42:17,728
He was my friend.

506
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,273
Yeah, well, he's nobody's friend any more.

507
00:42:20,416 --> 00:42:22,609
He's a fucking animal.

508
00:42:22,812 --> 00:42:25,447
Laces out of your shoes.

509
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:40,079
Table.

510
00:43:07,671 --> 00:43:10,103
Barney? Visitor.

511
00:43:10,658 --> 00:43:12,470
This one's real.

512
00:43:13,713 --> 00:43:15,142
You can wait here.

513
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:17,658
No. I can't.

514
00:43:25,409 --> 00:43:26,922
It's your funeral.

515
00:43:27,142 --> 00:43:29,010
- I'll have to lock you in.
- Yeah.

516
00:43:52,816 --> 00:43:54,256
Hello, Barney.

517
00:43:55,272 --> 00:43:56,963
Arthur says to say hello.

518
00:43:58,895 --> 00:44:00,375
Sergeant Major?

519
00:44:01,919 --> 00:44:03,192
You're alive?

520
00:44:03,908 --> 00:44:05,619
Arthur's alive, John's dead,

521
00:44:05,706 --> 00:44:07,682
Danny's dead, Freddie's dead...

522
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:11,447
...Jeremiah preaches the gospel barefoot.

523
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:13,650
Yeah.

524
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:15,880
And I'm alive.

525
00:44:19,913 --> 00:44:22,127
Them as have gone are the lucky ones.

526
00:44:25,928 --> 00:44:28,439
Thanks for the letters you send,
Sergeant Major.

527
00:44:28,546 --> 00:44:32,244
Yeah, Arthur mostly writes them.
I just... just sign them.

528
00:44:34,114 --> 00:44:36,787
How the fuck do you write back?
With your fucking teeth?

529
00:44:36,936 --> 00:44:38,689
No, they stick the pen up me arse.

530
00:44:52,912 --> 00:44:55,088
Someone in here said your name.

531
00:44:56,304 --> 00:44:59,137
They said
out there you are a politician now.

532
00:44:59,459 --> 00:45:00,979
Sometimes I am.

533
00:45:02,865 --> 00:45:05,299
I didn't know if it was real, comrade.

534
00:45:06,638 --> 00:45:10,151
I see rats coming out of bodies
like at the black wood.

535
00:45:10,239 --> 00:45:12,479
The shit they give me in here...

536
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,377
Hey, Barney, look at me.

537
00:45:30,222 --> 00:45:32,455
Barney, this here is opium and cyanide.

538
00:45:33,232 --> 00:45:34,916
It'll bring on a heart attack.

539
00:45:35,346 --> 00:45:38,408
They won't even check the cause.
You won't feel a fucking thing.

540
00:45:44,146 --> 00:45:45,674
So, here.

541
00:45:48,414 --> 00:45:50,134
You're in here forever, brother.

542
00:45:51,677 --> 00:45:53,705
You don't have the use
of your fucking hands.

543
00:45:55,504 --> 00:45:57,264
You're still in the tunnels.

544
00:45:58,607 --> 00:46:00,478
I can give this to you now.

545
00:46:02,888 --> 00:46:04,728
Do you want it?

546
00:46:09,544 --> 00:46:11,041
No.

547
00:46:26,462 --> 00:46:28,062
Why not?

548
00:46:33,131 --> 00:46:34,571
I know.

549
00:46:37,152 --> 00:46:38,792
I know.

550
00:46:40,774 --> 00:46:42,752
You still remember...

551
00:46:42,947 --> 00:46:44,593
..that French waitress.

552
00:46:53,679 --> 00:46:55,672
You still going on about that, Tom?

553
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:56,830
Yeah.

554
00:46:57,744 --> 00:46:59,578
Did you fuck her before me?
Because whoever did

555
00:46:59,666 --> 00:47:01,979
gave me the fucking clap.
But I'm guessing it was you.

556
00:47:02,066 --> 00:47:04,713
- Yes, I fucked her before you did!
- Yeah.

557
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,416
- She was beautiful.
- She was.

558
00:47:09,543 --> 00:47:10,783
She was.

559
00:47:12,244 --> 00:47:13,277
And I reckon

560
00:47:13,365 --> 00:47:15,285
I was second best after Barney.

561
00:47:16,378 --> 00:47:18,103
Why did you bring the capsule, Tom?

562
00:47:18,191 --> 00:47:19,963
You're in here, Barney,

563
00:47:20,516 --> 00:47:24,064
you have no hands, there is no daylight...

564
00:47:24,707 --> 00:47:26,494
...and you don't wanna die.

565
00:47:27,488 --> 00:47:29,103
No, I don't.

566
00:47:33,553 --> 00:47:35,993
Because one day things might change.

567
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:47,197
Yeah.

568
00:47:49,159 --> 00:47:50,839
Things might change.

569
00:47:53,984 --> 00:47:55,767
Maybe they already have.

570
00:47:57,556 --> 00:47:59,963
Come here, Barney.

571
00:48:00,452 --> 00:48:01,812
Come here.

572
00:48:05,168 --> 00:48:06,928
What if I could break you out of here?

573
00:48:08,016 --> 00:48:09,696
Why would you break me out?

574
00:48:11,177 --> 00:48:14,752
See, the trouble with the people in here
is the fucking meds they keep you on.

575
00:48:16,794 --> 00:48:19,767
Ten years since we were back,

576
00:48:19,986 --> 00:48:21,866
Barney, ten fucking years.

577
00:48:23,496 --> 00:48:24,978
Maybe the storm has passed.

578
00:48:25,066 --> 00:48:26,706
Passed for you, then, has it, Tom?

579
00:48:29,125 --> 00:48:31,038
What would the world do with me
if I was out?

580
00:48:31,126 --> 00:48:32,463
I've a job for you.

581
00:48:34,274 --> 00:48:35,227
Fuck!

582
00:48:35,315 --> 00:48:36,475
Barney...

583
00:48:37,869 --> 00:48:41,783
Barney, you were the best fucking sniper
in our company. Never missed.

584
00:48:42,736 --> 00:48:44,776
I can use that man.

585
00:48:45,808 --> 00:48:50,252
I'll get you the latest BSA,
fucking... telescopic sights.

586
00:48:51,386 --> 00:48:52,539
Who am I shooting?

587
00:48:52,626 --> 00:48:55,502
Fuck do you care, Barney?
Get that fucking thing off,

588
00:48:55,736 --> 00:48:57,032
get you free.

589
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:59,280
- <i>Are you all right in there?</i>
- Grand in here.

590
00:49:03,249 --> 00:49:04,769
What do you say, Barney?

591
00:49:06,307 --> 00:49:07,867
I'll come for you...

592
00:49:08,392 --> 00:49:10,465
...after midnight on Wednesday.

593
00:49:10,553 --> 00:49:12,186
I don't keep track of days, Tom.

594
00:49:12,274 --> 00:49:13,307
Don't have to.

595
00:49:13,431 --> 00:49:16,351
You'll know it will be Wednesday,
cos there'll be a big fucking bang.

596
00:49:17,077 --> 00:49:18,757
All right.

597
00:49:23,817 --> 00:49:25,262
Big fucking bang.

598
00:49:25,965 --> 00:49:27,309
Big fucking bang.

599
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:29,293
Big fucking bang.

600
00:50:14,666 --> 00:50:16,395
It's fucking Wednesday!

601
00:50:18,946 --> 00:50:21,306
Big bang on Wednesday!

602
00:50:40,406 --> 00:50:42,821
They called from the Black Boy
in Knowle.

603
00:50:43,119 --> 00:50:44,679
They'll be here any minute.

604
00:50:45,671 --> 00:50:48,047
I hear you agreed to give up the north.

605
00:50:49,256 --> 00:50:53,209
I hear... there needs to be
some certainty in the south.

606
00:50:53,491 --> 00:50:56,804
Some of my people were attacked
by members of the Titanic,

607
00:50:56,892 --> 00:50:58,930
who've heard about a cargo.

608
00:50:59,064 --> 00:51:01,694
Mr Mosley is open to suggestion

609
00:51:01,782 --> 00:51:04,440
regarding who he can rely on
to offer him support in London.

610
00:51:05,345 --> 00:51:09,778
Well, I would suggest the most competent
organiser of men in the south...

611
00:51:10,021 --> 00:51:11,549
..is Alfie Solomons.

612
00:51:12,868 --> 00:51:14,424
He's dead.

613
00:51:15,779 --> 00:51:17,578
And he's Jewish!

614
00:51:18,310 --> 00:51:20,943
And I'd say as far as
our boss is concerned,

615
00:51:21,031 --> 00:51:24,431
him being dead would be less
of an obstacle than him being Jewish.

616
00:51:25,869 --> 00:51:28,805
I think he'll give London to the Italians.

617
00:51:29,016 --> 00:51:30,786
He likes Italians.

618
00:51:31,738 --> 00:51:34,126
That'll mean more concessions
on your part,

619
00:51:34,214 --> 00:51:37,214
but you're going to have
to accept it, tinker boy.

620
00:51:39,209 --> 00:51:40,766
I like Wincanton.

621
00:51:41,613 --> 00:51:43,373
It's a grand old racecourse.

622
00:51:45,741 --> 00:51:47,476
And that brother of yours,

623
00:51:47,860 --> 00:51:50,711
the one who left me a hand grenade...

624
00:51:52,056 --> 00:51:55,336
...he'd be the first of you tinkers
I'd go for if our truce should end

625
00:51:55,424 --> 00:51:57,258
and the whistle blew.

626
00:51:57,459 --> 00:52:01,047
Good. He's in the mood for a quarrel.

627
00:52:03,502 --> 00:52:07,157
- We had a brush with the Titanic, Tom.
- Yeah, I heard.

628
00:52:07,245 --> 00:52:11,245
Yeah. Fun night. Got noisy, though.

629
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:16,173
And to think they all said I was mad
to take me dad with me, eh?

630
00:52:16,426 --> 00:52:17,930
Your dad? Who's your dad?

631
00:52:18,094 --> 00:52:20,172
This is my fucking dad.

632
00:52:20,881 --> 00:52:22,714
Right here.

633
00:52:22,802 --> 00:52:24,395
This is my fucking dad.

634
00:52:24,598 --> 00:52:26,063
Where's Aberama?

635
00:52:27,709 --> 00:52:29,862
He got off at Solihull.

636
00:52:30,813 --> 00:52:33,546
Said if he sees Billy Boy here...

637
00:52:34,241 --> 00:52:36,354
..he'll cut his fucking throat.

638
00:52:36,683 --> 00:52:37,716
Tell the tinker

639
00:52:37,804 --> 00:52:39,774
he's welcome to come and try it
any time.

640
00:52:39,862 --> 00:52:41,175
Mm.

641
00:52:41,451 --> 00:52:42,992
Is it all aboard?

642
00:52:47,286 --> 00:52:48,479
Yeah.

643
00:52:49,027 --> 00:52:50,267
It's all there.

644
00:52:50,798 --> 00:52:52,471
We weighed it at the wharf.

645
00:52:52,786 --> 00:52:53,969
We used cockney scales.

646
00:52:54,057 --> 00:52:56,367
I wouldn't trust 'em.
They're probably crooked.

647
00:52:57,085 --> 00:53:01,625
- But, er, I reckon seven tons.
- Curly?

648
00:53:03,094 --> 00:53:04,367
Put ten sacks of flour

649
00:53:04,455 --> 00:53:07,821
- onto Mr McCavern's boat.
- Tom!

650
00:53:08,169 --> 00:53:09,931
I-I don't think it's really flour.

651
00:53:10,019 --> 00:53:12,110
I know, Curly. Just do as I say.

652
00:53:12,348 --> 00:53:13,661
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

653
00:53:13,749 --> 00:53:14,869
Curly?

654
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:21,023
Hey, Arthur?

655
00:53:21,735 --> 00:53:23,367
Someday, yes?

656
00:53:23,676 --> 00:53:24,956
You and me.

657
00:53:26,453 --> 00:53:28,430
Oh, Tommy, hey?

658
00:53:28,756 --> 00:53:30,316
Fascists, hmm?

659
00:53:32,074 --> 00:53:33,874
Look at 'em.

660
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:37,094
I fucking hate 'em. Always have done.

661
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:39,985
But you...

662
00:53:40,558 --> 00:53:42,578
You, Billy Boy...

663
00:53:42,967 --> 00:53:46,400
...oh, you're special.
Y'know, I fucking like him, Tommy.

664
00:53:46,496 --> 00:53:48,016
I like yer.

665
00:53:48,512 --> 00:53:50,733
I do. You're a man after me own heart.

666
00:53:50,821 --> 00:53:52,578
- Someday, Mr Shelby.
- Yeah.

667
00:53:52,666 --> 00:53:53,786
- Someday.
- Yeah.

668
00:53:54,666 --> 00:53:56,242
Yeah.

669
00:54:01,962 --> 00:54:04,196
You just tell me when, Tom.

670
00:54:04,841 --> 00:54:06,383
You just tell me when.

671
00:54:09,311 --> 00:54:10,944
So, er...

672
00:54:11,077 --> 00:54:14,414
- ..so you spoke to Barney Thomason, eh?
- Yeah.

673
00:54:16,011 --> 00:54:17,411
Barney Thomason...

674
00:54:18,911 --> 00:54:20,504
...is gonna kill...

675
00:54:20,592 --> 00:54:24,625
...Oswald Mosley,
shoot him in the fucking head.

676
00:54:25,103 --> 00:54:26,103
Yep.

677
00:54:27,373 --> 00:54:29,046
While he's on stage.

678
00:54:29,212 --> 00:54:31,069
While I'm stood next to him.

679
00:54:32,516 --> 00:54:35,316
And then I will take over
as leader of the party...

680
00:54:36,200 --> 00:54:40,232
..and you and Aberama can take care
of that bastard McCavern.

681
00:54:41,429 --> 00:54:45,490
I had more complicated strategies in mind
for Mr Mosley.

682
00:54:46,306 --> 00:54:47,499
Then he spoke badly

683
00:54:47,586 --> 00:54:48,946
to my wife.

684
00:54:50,374 --> 00:54:52,365
It's going to be
a busy few weeks, brother.

685
00:54:52,453 --> 00:54:53,653
Yeah.

686
