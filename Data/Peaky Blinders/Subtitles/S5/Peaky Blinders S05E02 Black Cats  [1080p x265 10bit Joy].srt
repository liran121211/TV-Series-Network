Dad, there's a phone call for ya!

00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,160
Charlie!

Charlie!

10
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,960
Wait! Charlie!

11
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:11,080
Giddy-up, horsey! Giddy-up!

12
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,640
Dad, there's a phone call for ya.

13
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:22,920
Good boy. Good boy.

14
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,760
Well, you go back to the house,

15
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,680
and whoever's calling,
the operator will have their number,

16
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,760
and I'll call them back. Eh?

17
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,520
Oh, look, Charlie,
you must have violin practice.

18
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,440
It's Mrs Milligan. Go on.

19
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,840
Charlie. Charlie, you play loudly!

20
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,960
You might hear some bangs.

21
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:50,720
Go on.

22
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,320
<i>Hi, Mr Shelby.</i>

23
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,600
Maggie? Yeah, it's me.

24
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,960
<i>-Yes, Mr Shelby.</i>
-I just missed a call. Where was it from?

25
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,920
<i>Er, Belfast.</i>

26
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,440
Belfast.

27
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,720
Where in Belfast?

28
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,280
<i>Er, I'm not sure.</i>

29
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,440
Do you have the number?

30
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,160
<i>-Yes.</i>
-Yeah.

31
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,520
<i>It's 0-8-24.</i>

32
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,080
Yeah, can you put me through?

33
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:13,880
<i>Tommy. Don't--</i>

34
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,960
Mr Shelby.

35
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,520
My name is Captain Swing,
calling from the occupied six counties.

36
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,280
And there are some people

37
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,200
from the other side of our
neat little city that want you dead.

38
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:34,360
<i>You should also know</i>
<i>that this boy,</i>

39
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,159
<i>this Michael, your kin,</i>

40
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:40,880
was in his cabin aboard
the SS <i>Monroe</i> in Belfast dock,

41
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,880
making deals with the very men
who want you dead.

42
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,960
-Tommy, they're lying!
-Now, if you want,

43
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:48,520
we can put a bullet in his head,
here and now,

44
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,920
or we can send him home,
and you can deal with him.

45
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,200
Send him home.

46
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,240
Very well, Mr Shelby.

47
00:09:02,840 --> 00:09:05,560
But be informed that this kin of yours

48
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,880
was talking to representatives from
the County Tyrone and Glasgow UVF

49
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:12,440
about how they'd divide up
the English racetracks

50
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,040
after they'd blown away your legs.

51
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,680
Tommy, they're lying!

52
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,240
And may I ask...

53
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,400
why you are doing me this favour?

54
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,560
Because, Mr Shelby, we've been informed
by people at the very highest level

55
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:32,680
that since your conversion to socialism,

56
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,640
you're now on the side of the angels.

57
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,800
And angels can be useful to us.

58
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,600
-Come.

59
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,800
Mr Shelby, the violin teacher
wants to know what all those bangs were.

60
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,800
Fireworks. I was trying 'em out
for Saturday.

61
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,720
You promised the doctor
not until after dark.

62
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,000
It's pretty dark, Frances.

63
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,880
Also, will Mrs Shelby and Ruby
be home for dinner tonight?

64
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,200
I don't know.

65
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,160
Dad?

66
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,560
I've learned something this morning.

67
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,560
Have ya?

68
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,720
So have I.

69
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,960
And what have you learned, my boy?

70
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,480
Let's get this over with.
I've got a train to catch.

71
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,960
Go get your train, Tom.
I can deal with this.

72
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,200
Hey!

73
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,440
Go home.

74
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,480
Come here, you.

75
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,320
Put this on.

76
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:06,080
There you go. Look at that.
Looks great on ya! Wrap up warm.

77
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:20,760
Wake up.

78
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,200
Rise and shine.

79
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,520
What are you doing here?

80
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,000
Wasting our fucking time on you.

81
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,080
Sit down, Finn.

82
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,160
Sit down.

83
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,480
What do I have to do...

84
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,880
to make you fucking listen to me?

85
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,360
You took a bullet.

86
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:52,800
You've been running around the streets
with a fucking gun in your hand.

87
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,280
Somebody has to.

88
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,320
Finn, we've got people
for that kind of work.

89
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,400
Soldiers. Captains and corporals.

90
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,320
Well, then, what am I?

91
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,360
"What am I?" Jesus Christ.

92
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,240
Yeah. What am I, Tom? Huh?

93
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,400
I'm the brother you never got around to.

94
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,680
You're a general, Finn.

95
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,360
You understand? You're a fucking Shelby,
so you're a general.

96
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:26,320
When did you last see a general
anywhere near the blood and the puke, eh?

97
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,520
He's fucking right.

98
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,440
That's what you are.

99
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,360
So, on your feet, soldier.

100
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,000
Come on, on your feet!

101
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,080
I thought you just said I was a general.

102
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,840
I did just say you were.

103
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:43,240
-So, get on your fucking feet--
-Arthur.

104
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,680
Finn. Finn. Look at this.

105
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,400
This is the bullet
that Aberama Gold cut from you.

106
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,480
First and last.

107
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,480
First and last.

108
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,560
Don't lose it.

109
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,320
Go and clean up.

110
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,720
Put some clothes on. Nice suit.

111
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,560
I've got some trouble
that'll keep you out of trouble.

112
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,360
-Oh, and, er, Tom...
-Yeah?

113
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,200
While you're here, erm,

114
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,440
I've met this girl,
and I'd like to get married.

115
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,000
Fuck off. Go, get dressed.

116
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,240
Go on. Move.

117
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,160
Go!

118
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,520
Finn, this girl
you're trying to impress...

119
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,960
Tell me about her.

120
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:31,640
She likes the life.

121
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,280
She likes the life, eh?

122
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,400
Well, find one that hates it.

123
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,240
Look at him. That's what he did,
and now he's chairman of the board.

124
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,440
Go on. Hurry up.

125
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,960
Arthur? Lizzie and Ruby...

126
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,400
are they still at yours?

127
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,760
Yes, Tom, they're still there.

128
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,520
She's coming home today, she said, so...

129
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,440
She'll be home later.

130
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,760
Hmm. Has she been talking about me?

131
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,120
I mean, they talk a lot.
You know what women are like.

132
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,960
The kitchen and... You know?

133
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:09,120
Kids running around.
I don't pay 'em no mind, Tom.

134
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,800
-I don't listen to 'em half the time.
- Yeah.

135
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,120
Well, everything she says is true.

136
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:19,360
Well...

137
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,080
-You like the life, Tommy.
-I don't like the fucking life.

138
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,720
I don't like the fucking life.

139
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,440
I don't like that
Michael is coming back today.

140
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,840
Train arrives from Liverpool at 3:00.

141
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:37,360
Polly will be there. Take a weapon.

142
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,160
Tell Moss to clear the station of coppers,
you hear me?

143
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,520
Yes, sir.

144
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,840
Hey, Tom...

145
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,040
I heard 'em say one thing, though.

146
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,240
Just talking, you know?
They were saying that, er...

147
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,320
you don't sleep,
or something.

148
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,120
You can't sleep.

149
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,560
When I do sleep,

150
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:06,600
I dream.

151
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,840
And in my dream,

152
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:12,400
someone wants my crown.

153
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,920
Think it might be Michael.

154
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,000
Call me at 3:00.

155
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:27,440
Arthur, I'm gonna put that bullet
on a necklace and wear it as a reminder.

156
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,160
Arthur?

157
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,800
-I heard ya.
-You got trouble for me, then?

158
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:33,920
-Yeah.
-Yeah?

159
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,600
Mr Shelby... Er... Er...
The police are here to see you.

160
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,960
Police aren't allowed in here.

161
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:56,160
Er... He's not in uniform
and said it's very unofficial.

162
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,000
Afternoon. Someone get you some tea?

163
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:05,360
No, I'm fine, Mr Shelby.

164
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,760
-This won't take long.
- Good.

165
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,240
You got five minutes.

166
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,960
Mr Shelby,

167
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:16,200
there was a shooting two days ago.
A man died.

168
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:18,079
It was a murder.

169
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,200
In Maida Vale,

170
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,400
of all places.

171
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,160
-His name was Levitt.
-Uh-huh.

172
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,920
He was a journalist.

173
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,040
The night before he was shot,
he came here to see you.

174
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,520
We found a Commons pass
and your name in his diary.

175
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,280
I was wondering
what his business here was.

176
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:57,800
And I'm wondering...

177
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,560
what your business here is.

178
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,280
According to his diary,
you knew him from Birmingham.

179
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,360
What's your name?

180
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:10,920
-Stacker.
-Stacker. Okay.

181
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,840
Mr Shelby, Mr Levitt was a queer.

182
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,720
Some may think
it was one of his queer friends.

183
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:20,280
Mr Stacker,

184
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:23,800
I get the feeling
that with a little provocation,

185
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,920
you could be very persistent.

186
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:28,280
Only within my remit.

187
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,600
Well, your Chief Constable Wyatt,

188
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:34,720
he has very clear views about persistence
which he has shared with me.

189
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,840
-Mr Shelby--
-He likes persistence,

190
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,680
as do I, and thoroughness.

191
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:40,760
But not frivolity.

192
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:45,440
A man who walks in the park with other men

193
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,960
dies in Maida Vale.

194
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,080
And you come to me?

195
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,040
As well as his diary,

196
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,360
-we have his notebook.

197
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,320
Your time's up, Mr Stacker.

198
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,120
Thank you.

Hello, Mum!

204
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,400
This is Gina.

205
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,240
Gina Gray.

206
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,840
The captain married us on board.

207
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,640
She's my wife, Mum.
At least look at her.

208
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:09,640
Tommy said to ask you
to tell me the truth.

209
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,800
We've been travelling
for 15 days, Mrs Gray.

210
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,680
Maybe we could talk about this
at another time?

211
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,920
Yes. Let's go home and we can talk.

212
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,920
You have no home
until you tell me the truth.

213
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:23,920
-Here?
-Yeah.

214
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:28,880
Michael!

215
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:33,520
Hello, love.

216
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,920
Welcome to Birmingham, eh.

217
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,160
Michael.

218
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,480
Okay.

219
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,200
Our ship docked at Belfast.

220
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:50,640
-I was then taken off the ship by two men.
-At gunpoint--

221
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,800
I'm speaking to my son.

222
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,960
Fuck you.

223
00:20:55,680 --> 00:20:57,280
Fuck you, too, Arthur!

224
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,640
This is my fucking wife.

225
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,720
I'm bringing her home, to this.

226
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,040
Come on, Gina.

227
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,720
Well, where are you going now, eh? Hmm?

228
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,680
Introduce me, at least.

229
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,360
-Excuse me.
-Look at this.

230
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,600
Look at this.

231
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,520
This is it, Gina.

232
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,760
This is my fuckin' people.

233
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,360
Do you wanna know the truth, Arthur?

234
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,760
Do you wanna know the truth, Mum?

235
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:34,360
I did not betray my fucking family!

236
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,160
Now, Mum,

237
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,880
I want to go home.

238
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,840
I've booked you a suite
at the Midland Hotel.

239
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,640
Was that Tommy's orders,
then, was it?

240
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,680
See, the Midland Hotel
is Tommy's little kingdom,

241
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,160
where all the porters keep an eye,

242
00:21:57,080 --> 00:22:00,400
where all the telephone exchange girls
are reporting on my calls.

243
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,600
Yeah, well, why don't you
think of it like, er...

244
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:05,960
quarantine, Michael, eh?

245
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:10,480
We treat you like a fucking dog. Hmm?

246
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:15,240
Smelly one, stinking one,

247
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:19,160
until we know you're clean.

248
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:20,760
Hmm?

249
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,920
-Fuck you, Arthur.

250
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,440
Stand aside, Arthur.

251
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,640
No, Pol.

252
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,400
Come on, baby. Forget about it.

253
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,160
Go and phone Tommy.

254
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,520
Tell him,

255
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,560
"Polly says Michael's telling the truth."

256
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:46,080
It's all right. Forget about it.

257
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,320
All right, Pol.

258
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,880
Nice coat.

259
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,880
What are you, like, a camel, right?

260
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,800
Oh.

261
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:02,480
Welcome to the family, Gina Gray.

262
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,560
I applaud the attempt
in the Trevelyan Education Bill

263
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,240
to raise the school-leaving age to 15.

264
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:19,360

00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,600
-we are the people.

270
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,560
We've had enough.

271
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,800
Hear, hear!

272
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,200
"We are the people and we've had enough."

273
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,880
I move in favour of the amendment.

274
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,240
Mr Shelby.

275
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,920
I must say,
you sing like a songbird in the House.

276
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,880
-And who is this pretty finch?
-My sister.

277
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:13,240
-Who's pregnant.
-And dangerous.

278
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,400
Oh, we adore dangerous.

279
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,680
Who's "we"?

280
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,840
It's a collective noun.

281
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,600
In this case, describing a group of people
who are impatient and young

282
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:25,600
and, as I have said, adore dangerous.

283
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:31,320
Mr Shelby, you had a horse of that name.

284
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,360
Whiskey, Irish.

285
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,840
Give him one from my bottle,

286
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,240
and one for myself.

287
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:39,800
In fact, bring the bottle.

288
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,400
And the lady?

289
00:24:42,040 --> 00:24:44,720
Isn't thirsty.
How'd you know about the horse?

290
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,640
We have a mutual acquaintance.

291
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:50,920
May Carleton.

292
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,120
When I asked about you, she said,
"Oh, my goodness, where do I begin?"

293
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,640
And why were you asking after me?

294
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,440
Because, as I have said,
I adore dangerous.

295
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,920
And where did she begin?

296
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,960
You know, I was rather hoping
we might have this meeting alone.

297
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:12,000
My sister is my political advisor.

298
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:15,000
And my advice just now was,
"Don't meet Mr Mosley."

299
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,920
Because I am dangerous?

300
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,120
No.

301
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:21,680
What is it
you are impatient for, Mr Mosley?

302
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,680
I'm impatient for my fucking whiskey.

303
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,240
Bennet!

304
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,760
May Carleton spoke about you

305
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,680
the way I imagine one might
about a party they barely remember,

306
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:40,760
where you crash the car into the dovecote

307
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:44,040
and live on champagne and cocaine
for three whole days.

308
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:45,520
You know that kind of party?

309
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,200
Only three days?

310
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,320
My sister advised against meeting you

311
00:25:57,880 --> 00:25:59,040
because it appears

312
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,800
you are moving away from the party...

313
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,480
in a different direction.

314
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,120
And which direction is that?

315
00:26:07,880 --> 00:26:09,600
Towards fascism.

316
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,240
"We are the people
and we have had enough."

317
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:18,480
I thought that was excellent.

318
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,960
In which direction
are you heading, Mr Shelby?

319
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,440
I am my own revolution.

320
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,480
And you prefer Irish to Scotch.

321
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:31,760
As do I.

322
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,240
Like all things regarding Ireland,
it is complex, yes?

323
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:44,960
Oh.

324
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,480
Where do you stand
on the Irish Question, Mr Shelby?

325
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,320
Never been asked it.

326
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,640
Then perhaps it's time you were.

327
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:59,240
Tommy, I am the people,
and I have had enough.

328
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,240
We're looking for someone
to begin a dialogue

329
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,680
with certain elements in Belfast

330
00:27:04,760 --> 00:27:07,600
with whom we don't officially
have any dealings.

331
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:11,160
I'll be too busy singing in the House.

332
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,880
It would involve a promotion.

333
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,840
Junior minister to the Duchy of Lancaster.

334
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,720
Birmingham is my concern.

335
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:22,680
Ireland bores me.

336
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,800
Thanks for the whiskey, Mr Mosley.

337
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:37,440
What the fuck was that about?

338
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:40,680
Ireland. It's been Ireland's day
all fucking day long.

339
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:41,800
What do you mean?

340
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:43,320
Ada, go home

341
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,600
and start calling anyone who had dealings
with Shelby Company Limited

342
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,000
while you were in Boston.

343
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,480
Ask 'em about Michael.

344
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,800
Ask them what about him?

345
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,000
Who he's been seeing,

346
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:55,480
who he's been meeting,

347
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:56,960
what deals he's made.

348
00:27:57,040 --> 00:27:58,240
Why?

349
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,480
Ask 'em especially about people
he's met from Glasgow or Belfast.

350
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,520
Tommy, why don't you
come back with me, huh?

351
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:08,240
You can play chess with Karl.

352
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,880
I'll make some calls, you can listen in.
Drive home tomorrow--

353
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,880
Then that bastard

354
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,040
starts talking about Irish whiskey.
What the fuck does he know, eh?

355
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,320
More than me, Tommy.
What are you talking about?

356
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,840
I'm talking about an empty chair, Ada.

357
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,080
My chair. My throne.

358
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,720
People think that I'm gonna fall.

359
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:28,320
They start behaving
in a different way around here.

360
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,560
Who thinks that?

361
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,880
They start to circle.

362
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,000
Who's gonna take the throne, eh?

363
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,520
Linda, she wants some for Arthur...

364
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,120
Aberama Gold,
people in the north, Michael...

365
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,320
Just go home, make some calls.

366
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:48,800
Protestants are coming, I think.

367
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,000
I need to get back to Birmingham.

368
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,480
Polly.

369
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,040
You armed?

370
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:09,760
Yeah.

371
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:11,720
Yeah.

372
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,240
Will you please consider
putting your weapons behind the bar,

373
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,120
in case feelings begin to run high?

374
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,200
Behind the bar, Pol, eh?

375
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,280
Behind my own bar, yeah?

376
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:29,840
I prefer it there.

377
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,640
Thomas.

378
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,320
Had a dream...

379
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,720
about a black cat last night, Pol.

380
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,400
A black cat dream

381
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:54,240
means there is a traitor close by.
It was you who taught me that.

382
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:56,880
Black cat can mean lots of things.

383
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,880
It can mean you're hurting yourself,
betraying yourself.

384
00:30:02,920 --> 00:30:04,280
Are you seeing things, Thomas?

385
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,240
Yes, I am.

386
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,480
Yes, I am, very clearly.

387
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,240
Coming from every fucking direction.

388
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,080
Tommy.

389
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,800
I'd like to introduce you to my wife.

390
00:30:36,560 --> 00:30:38,920
I would also like to, er, say something.

391
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,080
Sit down, Michael.

392
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,440
-I betrayed you.
-Michael.

393
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:43,760
But only in my heart.

394
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,240
There was a time, in America,

395
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,240
when there was
a lot of money in that bank.

396
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,800
And I wondered, I could...

397
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:53,960
I could leave, move to California.

398
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,000
Someone said I should invest in pictures.

399
00:30:57,760 --> 00:30:59,000
-Hollywood.

400
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,240
But Gina stopped me.

401
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,600
-Gina said that--
-I told you to sit down, Michael.

402
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,800
Now tell me...

403
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,120
what happened on that ship...

404
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,760
in Belfast harbour.

405
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,880
On the journey back from New York,
we got married.

406
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,800
But we needed to find a witness, a purser.

407
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,520
He was from Belfast. We got friendly.

408
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,360
What happened when the ship docked?

409
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:40,360
This purser had friends
who ran a whiskey distillery

410
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,800
in County Tyrone.

411
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:44,440
They wanted a way
of getting their stuff into America.

412
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,480
So I said, "Okay, invite them aboard."

413
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:50,440
When they came in,
I realized that they didn't make whiskey.

414
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,880
They were Scottish, from Glasgow.

415
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:55,600
Couldn't understand
a fucking word they were saying.

416
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:59,560
They started swearing,
so I asked Gina to leave.

417
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,760
That was when they
started talking about you, Tom.

418
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,520
They said that Tommy Shelby
was a spent force.

419
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,760
That politics had got to him.

420
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,680
That he was spent in the head.

421
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:17,480
That now was a good time to move in,
and did I want to be part of it?

422
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,160
They knew about the money
we lost in America.

423
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,040
They said that you were going to blame me,

424
00:32:22,120 --> 00:32:24,200
that you had a bullet with my name on it.

425
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,440
What did you say, Michael?

426
00:32:28,520 --> 00:32:30,160
I didn't have time
to say anything.

427
00:32:31,160 --> 00:32:32,720
Coppers came on board.

428
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,320
Well, I thought they were coppers.
They, er...

429
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:38,040
They were IRA.

430
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,840
Exactly.

431
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,640
And the first men, from Glasgow?

432
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:53,800
The IRA commander
said the men from Glasgow

433
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,480
were called Billy Boys.

434
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,120
Fucking Billy Boys.

435
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:00,160
I don't know who the fuck Billy Boys are.

436
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,280
They run every man

437
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:05,720
in every coal mine,
on every shipyard east of Glasgow.

438
00:33:06,280 --> 00:33:11,760
Ties with Belfast, UVF.
Protestant razor gang.

439
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:14,440
They also dabble in politics.

440
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:19,160
You know, muscle for fascist rallies.

441
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,440
But you did no deal, Michael.

442
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,080
You didn't even know who they were?

443
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,840
I was too busy looking forward to
giving you the good news.

444
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:32,280
The reason Gina and I got married
on the ship was because Gina is pregnant.

445
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,640
You're going to be a grandmother.

446
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,520
Okay, Michael.

447
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,400
I believe you.

448
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:50,160
Welcome home.

449
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,520
Congratulations.

450
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:54,560
Just remember...

451
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,920
your unborn child
has witnessed what you said...

452
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,360
Thomas.

453
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,200
...and it will be born accordingly.

454
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,760
-You fuck!
-Where the fuck are you going?

455
00:34:05,840 --> 00:34:06,680
Hmm?

456
00:34:07,160 --> 00:34:09,120
Are you fucking mad? Hmm?

457
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,639
-You are free to fucking leave, Michael.

458
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,719
You fucking bastard.

459
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,040
But you're not free, Michael, are you?

460
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,080
You lost this company a lot of money.

461
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:24,960
I told you to sell,

462
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,440
but you held on.

463
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,600
And now, I want you
to pay me back what you owe me.

464
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,760
There is work you can do,
there are risks you can take.

465
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,560
We were close before.

466
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,000
Now, I want you closer still.

467
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,960
Michael, honey,

468
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,800
look at your cousin.

469
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,560
He's in trouble. Huh?

470
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,600
He needs you.

471
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,199
Come on, baby.

472
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:58,520
Let's go.

473
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:24,560
Fucking cheek of her, eh?

474
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,880
Mad Dog Jimmy...

475
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,840
coming south.

476
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,840
Not so mad anymore.

477
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,480
He's got friends
in high places these days.

478
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:44,480
A black cat dream is never wrong, brother.

A broken broom
stops all Gypsy curses, Mr Gold.

486
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,600
Who the fuck are you?

487
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,480
Did you not hear my song?

488
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:20,280
These gentlemen are the Billy Boys.

489
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:24,840
And me?

490
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:29,880
I'm Jimmy.

491
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,440
-No! Fuck.

492
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:36,280
Good. Mouth broke so you can't talk.

493
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,200
But you don't need to.

494
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,960
-Your body will be the lesson.

495
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:49,200
You work in a particular capacity
for Mr Thomas Shelby OBE, am I right?

496
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:57,640
I heard you're a fighter.

497
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,120
The best.

498
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,080
But your fighting days are over.

499
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,560
Because I need Mr Shelby to understand...

500
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:14,160
-...that his best...
- Fuck.

501
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:16,960
...is not...

502
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,160
good enough.

503
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,840
Bonnie.

504
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,480
Farewell, fighter boy.
You died well.

505
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,520
Bonnie.

506
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,160
Bonnie!

507
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:46,000
Tell Thomas Shelby
it's time to fucking share.

508
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:51,240
We'll take all the tracks south
as far as Nottingham.

509
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,480
We'll take Cheltenham as well.

510
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,760
Otherwise, it will be
Thomas Shelby who's crucified,

511
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,080
and there will be no resurrection.

512
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,440
Come on, boys.

516

Ladies and gentlemen, I'm just gonna

517
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:56,800
Yeah.

518
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:07,320
Beautiful, Billy. Beautiful.

519
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,160
Really nice. Really nice.

520
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,160
Really meaningful,
you know, a heartfelt song.

521
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:19,200
I like it. I really do.

522
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:21,400
Boys...

523
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,400
this here is Billy Grade.

524
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,280
Man I was telling you about.

525
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,720
Billy, this here's my kid brother, Finn.

526
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:31,640
Hey.

527
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:34,680
Have a drink, Billy.

528
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:36,840
I can't, my voice is...

529
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,280
Drink, Bill.

530
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:40,680
Yeah.

531
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:42,920
Yeah.

532
00:41:48,520 --> 00:41:49,840
You boys won't remember,

533
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:54,840
but I remember when Billy here
made a living on the football pitch.

534
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:58,800
Yeah, that was
a long time ago, Mr Shelby.

535
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,200
-Yeah. What a left foot, eh?
-Yeah.

536
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,760
And then what?

537
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:05,160
Manager, right?

538
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,840
-Hmm?

539
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,320
Well, yeah. And now I'm a singer.

540
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,520
Are ya?

541
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:14,240
Every football team in England...

542
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,200
knows Billy Grade,

543
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,840
and he knows a few people, too.
Didn't you, Bill, eh? Hmm?

544
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,800
One or two.

545
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,760
Useful.

546
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,680
Very useful.

547
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:29,640
But what do you do, Bill, eh? Hmm?

548
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:35,480
You're in here, singing,
or whatever the fuck you call it,

549
00:42:35,560 --> 00:42:38,320
in shithole pubs in Birmingham.

550
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,640
That's no way to make a living, boys.

551
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,840
- Degrading.
- I love it.

552
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:49,360
I really do, I love it.

553
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:53,680
And thank you,
by the way, for inviting me here tonight.

554
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:55,000
I really appreciate it.
So, thank you very--

555
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:56,720
Don't thank me.

556
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:59,280
I didn't invite you here to sing.

557
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:03,840
I wanna listen to music,
I'll buy an Al Jolson record.

558
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:05,160
Hmm?

559
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,960
That's what I'd do.

560
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,800
Real singer, ya know?

561
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:13,080
Melody, tune.

562
00:43:15,600 --> 00:43:18,240
So, what is it that you want, exactly?

563
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:26,120
Finn will explain
the nature of my proposition.

564
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,480
You'll listen to him, won't you, Bill, eh?

565
00:43:29,560 --> 00:43:31,000
You'll be attentive, won't ya?

566
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,160
Yeah, of course. Of course.

567
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,360
'Cause Isiah here,

568
00:43:33,920 --> 00:43:37,280
he'll show you the fucking consequences
if you don't.

569
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:40,160
All right.

570
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,800
I'll leave you with the bottle. Hmm?

571
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:01,960
What proposition?

572
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:05,320
Right. What I want from you, Billy,

573
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:09,840
is for you to write down
a name and a number

574
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:12,600
next to every one
of those football teams, yeah?

575
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,400
-Why?
-Why?

576
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,600
People like to bet
on those kind of things these days.

577
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,880
-We're a gambling enterprise.
-I know who you are.

578
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,400
To fix a horse race,

579
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,600
you give the outsider a bit of cocaine.

580
00:44:22,680 --> 00:44:24,600
-Jesus.
-To fix a football match,

581
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,480
you give the goalkeeper 20 pounds.

582
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:41,000
You're a Peaky Blinder now, Billy.

583
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,520
Hmm?

584
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,200
What have you got there?

585
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,000
I've written a letter.

586
00:44:56,080 --> 00:44:56,920
Ah.

587
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:01,920
Who for?

588
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:03,000
For you.

589
00:45:03,920 --> 00:45:05,520
And Lizzie's written one to Tommy.

590
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,880
Well...

591
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,360
can I read it?

592
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:14,120
It's not finished yet.

593
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:17,600
I'm getting rid of the parts I wrote
when I was drunk.

594
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:20,400
By the way, I stopped drinking.

595
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,640
And your bottles of snow
I poured down the lavatory.

596
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,880
When I was drunk, I was too hard on you.
It's not your fault.

597
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:35,160
So...

598
00:45:37,520 --> 00:45:39,240
that letter's about me, is it?

599
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,400
Yeah.

600
00:45:41,560 --> 00:45:42,400
Hmm.

601
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,760
And about me.

602
00:45:44,680 --> 00:45:46,800
About the future, about the company.

603
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:49,680
Lizzie and I--

604
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:53,080
Sat here and made things worse
the last few hours, hmm?

605
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,040
Yeah.

606
00:45:54,120 --> 00:45:55,600
And we've come up with a plan.

607
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,320
You've come up with a plan, huh?

608
00:45:57,400 --> 00:45:59,240
Lizzie says Tommy won't live
two more years

609
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,960
if he carries on like this.
He's gone too far.

610
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,840
Is that was Lizzie says, hmm? Really, now?

611
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,960
Well, how far has he gone,
hmm, Linda? How far?

612
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,960
He's lost all the legitimate money
in America.

613
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:11,360
No. No, that was Michael.

614
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:14,360
He's fixing races, he's fixing football.

615
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,920
Following the financial crisis,

616
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,800
the Shelby Company Limited has to find
other sources of cash income.

617
00:46:20,880 --> 00:46:22,800
Tommy went into Chinatown.

618
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,880
He's selling out the communists
to the British intelligence.

619
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,960
And all the time, every day,
he gets more and more famous.

620
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:32,000
But that's okay, because if anyone
puts two and two together...

621
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:33,920
That wasn't us.

622
00:46:35,080 --> 00:46:35,920
It's not fucking us!

623
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,280
It's going to blow up, Arthur!
It can't sustain. You know it!

624
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,960
Oh, yeah? And what do you know?

625
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,080
You've worked it all out,
you and fuckin' Lizzie. Huh?

626
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,440
Got it all planned out, is that right?

627
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:48,360
Hmm?

628
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:54,800
I tell you, all you're gonna do
is you're gonna be a good fuckin' wife.

629
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:58,880
Yeah, like the perfect couple,
we'll go upstairs.

630
00:46:58,960 --> 00:46:59,960
Hmm?

631
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,960
We'll go upstairs...

632
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,000
Yeah. And we'll make love. Hmm?

633
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,520
I spent my day writing two letters
and deciding which one to give.

634
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:23,600
Looks like I'll have to
give the other one.

635
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,160
What other one?

636
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:30,080
What fucking other one?

637
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,920
What did you do with my letter?

638
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:48,400
I burnt it.

639
00:47:50,400 --> 00:47:51,640
So did Arthur.

640
00:47:53,720 --> 00:47:55,960
-Did you read it first?
-Yes.

641
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:58,880
That's more than Arthur did.

642
00:48:04,520 --> 00:48:06,680
Didn't help that you can't fucking spell.

643
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,960
I left school too early.

644
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:13,240
Did you read the bit about the lawyers?

645
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:14,600
Do you wanna fuck?

646
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,040
Didn't think so.

647
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,400
-You don't want to eat?
-No.

648
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:24,000
-You've got calls?
-Yeah.

649
00:48:32,600 --> 00:48:34,840
It's Ruby's birthday today, Tommy.

650
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:40,040
Do you know why I took her to Arthur's?

651
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:43,200
Because she said she's scared of you.

652
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,680
When she knows you're not coming home,
she's a different kid.

653
00:48:49,280 --> 00:48:51,960
But I've bought a cake,
and I want you there.

654
00:48:53,520 --> 00:48:54,840
We're in the drawing room.

655
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,000
Lizzie.

656
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,080
I'm in a room,

657
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,720
and they're coming at me.

658
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:14,640
But it's okay. I want 'em to.

659
00:49:16,160 --> 00:49:17,920
Last thing I want is silence.

660
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:23,200
Standing up there in silence,
and someone says...

661
00:49:26,120 --> 00:49:28,600
"Sorry about all that noise.

662
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:30,280
Sorry about all that...

663
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:32,240
dust.

664
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,200
Sorry about all that mud

665
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:37,520
and all that fucking blood."

666
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:40,720
And you say, "Don't be sorry.

667
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,720
Don't be sorry. It's all I can do now."

668
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,200
You want me to write this down?

669
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:55,040
Do you want me to write you
a fucking letter?

670
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,440
Me and Arthur can't write it down...

671
00:50:00,760 --> 00:50:03,400
'cause they haven't invented
the fucking words.

672
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,400
We don't have the fucking words.

673
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,200
And the worst thing is...

674
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:17,760
could've stayed at school,

675
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:20,360
but we volunteered.

676
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,400
Still don't have the fucking words.

677
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,480
Should you choose to depart, Tommy,

678
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:39,080
either by your own hand or someone else's,

679
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,480
the person who would
take your place is me.

680
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,600
Legally, financially, everything.

681
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,200
I need to know
there will be something left.

682
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:54,320
Well, you know, Lizzie, in my head,
I still pay you for it. So...

683
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:56,880
good luck with me.

684
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:06,240
I have business.

685
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:35,200
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ </i>

686
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:38,680
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

687
00:51:38,760 --> 00:51:40,760
Yeah, I wanna ask you some questions

688
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:44,040
about the night you met Michael Gray.

689
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,720
Make a wish.

690
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:54,320
Yay!

691
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:22,000
Okay, kids, come on. Let's go to bed.

692
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:23,840
-Quickly.
-Why? Who's coming?

693
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:26,720
That's the thing, Charles.
We don't know. We never know.

694
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,720
Tommy!

695
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:54,040
-Out of the fucking car.
- Don't!

696
00:52:54,120 --> 00:52:56,440
Get out of the fucking car now,

697
00:52:56,520 --> 00:52:57,880
or I'll open fire!

698
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:08,560
You looking for traitors?

699
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:10,160
There's one,

700
00:53:11,240 --> 00:53:12,880
-with his ribs mashed up!

701
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:15,480
The man's gone fucking mad, Tom!

702
00:53:17,280 --> 00:53:18,360
You did this?

703
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:20,280
With one arm and a hammer,

704
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:25,440
and a mighty pain, and a mighty fury!

705
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,880
They killed him.

706
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,400
My son.

707
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:37,560
They shot him and they put him up
on a fucking cross,

708
00:53:37,640 --> 00:53:39,160
and he's fucking dead!

709
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,520
Who did?

710
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:57,920
Only Johnny Dogs and his kin
knew where we were camped.

711
00:53:58,000 --> 00:53:59,520
No, Tom.

712
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,600
-No, I swear to God, I never told...
-I'll fucking kill you!

713
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:04,040
- I never told a--
- Fucking shoot him!

714
00:54:04,120 --> 00:54:09,120
-My only fucking son! My fucking only...
- Johnny! Johnny!

715
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:10,760
Fucking took him from me!

716
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:14,280
- My only son!
- It's shattered!

717
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,960
-Listen to me. Listen to me!

718
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:19,840
Your shoulder is shattered.

719
00:54:19,920 --> 00:54:21,560
You don't get it fixed,
you'll lose your arm.

720
00:54:21,640 --> 00:54:25,800
He's gone. They fucking killed him,
my only fucking son!

721
00:54:25,880 --> 00:54:27,640
I'll fucking kill you!

722
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:28,640
Listen to me!

723
00:54:29,840 --> 00:54:33,000
How can a one-armed man
avenge the death of his son, eh?

724
00:54:39,680 --> 00:54:41,400
They crucified my son...

725
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:44,720
for you.

726
00:54:53,880 --> 00:54:56,040
Get away from my house!

727
00:54:56,120 --> 00:54:57,120
All of you!

728
00:54:58,120 --> 00:55:00,320
Get away from my child!

729
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,320
This is my house.

730
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:05,640
And I don't want you back.

731
00:55:05,720 --> 00:55:08,080
I don't want you back!

732
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:28,080
You wanna take on the Billy Boys?

733
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:29,120
You need me alive.

734
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:33,600
Everyone fucking needs me.

735
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:39,960
Call an ambulance

736
00:55:40,040 --> 00:55:41,760
or a man will lose his arm.

737
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,360
Come on, Johnny!

738
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:04,720
Come on.

739
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:08,920
Tom.

740
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,800
I'm no black cat, Tom.

741
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:15,320
I know, Johnny. I know.

742
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,960
In all the world, of all of the people,

743
00:56:20,040 --> 00:56:21,960
you alone I know I can trust.
