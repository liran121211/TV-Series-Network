the board of directors tomorrow at noon.

What's wrong with today, Tom?

- I need to do some thinking.
- Oh, yeah.

- I won't be on my own. Never on my own.

come back tomorrow.

- Sorry, Ada.

356
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,120
I was getting excited, wasn't I?

357
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,800
Right.

358
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,800
Can I begin this family meeting
with a proposal?

359
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,920
From now on,
we find somewhere else to meet.

360
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,840
Your husband believes that being seen

361
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,240
mixing with the common people
is good politics.

362
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,720
Hmm. Well, if this is our campaign
for socialism,

363
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:56,000
perhaps next time, Polly, you won't
wear earrings worth more than the pub.

364
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:58,960
Right. Family meeting. First item.

365
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,600
This.

366
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,880
Dug out of our Finn's arm yesterday

367
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,400
by Aberama Gold using your gin
and a razor blade.

368
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,080
Finn?

369
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,320
He says they were sent to Limehouse.

370
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,680
Chinatown.

371
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,400
Sent by fucking who?

372
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,640
THOMAS: Sent by me.

373
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:17,280
I told Finn to stay out of this.
He obviously didn't listen.

374
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,520
Oh, Tommy, sweetheart, I listen to you.

375
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:25,560
I listen to you when you tell me
no more sport for anyone named Shelby.

376
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,680
I listen to you
when you make me promises.

377
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:33,480
What's in Chinatown, Tommy?
What the fuck is going on?

378
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,720
£50,000.

379
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,160
In cash.

380
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:41,240
He said they were sent to Chinatown
to kill somebody.

381
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:44,720
That kid needs educating, Tommy,
really does.

382
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,280
Jesus Christ, Tommy!

383
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:49,080
- It was a particular opportunity.
- A particular opportunity

384
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,040
presented to me in confidence.
I dealt with it in confidence.

385
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,200
But you told Polly.

386
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:58,600
Tommy told me there was
a pimp in East London who sold kids.

387
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:01,080
THOMAS: Fucking kids, Lizzie, eh? Hm?

388
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:05,720
This pimp was blackmailing a senior member
of the House of Lords, a very wealthy man.

389
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,600
Now this pimp is lying in a ditch,

390
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,040
covered in flies.

391
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,880
World's a better place.

392
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:16,480
Holy fuck! So now your business
is improving the world?

393
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,040
Sometimes, Ada...

394
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:23,320
...killing is a kindness.

395
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,680
Hm?

396
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:30,280
The man we did the job for
is a High Court judge.

397
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:34,520
We received intelligence from
a senior police officer in Scotland Yard.

398
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:38,120
I've made lots of new friends in London.
Men with influence.

399
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,520
The police felt the same way
about this pimp as we did.

400
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,400
He wasn't worth a trial.
The coppers cleared the streets for us.

401
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:48,040
This was work commissioned
by a High Court judge, by Scotland Yard

402
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,480
and by the House of Lords.

403
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:52,080
It's a particular opportunity.
It's not to be repeated.

404
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:54,720
- And it was the right thing to do.
- Fucking right.

405
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,600
Lizzie, you need to understand.

406
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,320
That you tell Polly, not me.

407
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:03,360
You need to understand that the corridors
of Westminster are very dimly lit.

408
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,800
And for those who make the rules,
there are no rules.

409
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,320
We own the ropes.
Who's going to hang us now, eh?

410
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,520
We? We own the ropes, do we?

411
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:15,280
Lizzie, Lizzie, if Finn had've listened
to me, you wouldn't have known.

412
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:17,360
When we go home, I'll explain.

413
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,720
LIZZIE: I can't be bothered
with this shit.

414
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,160
So...

415
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:31,280
...Tommy Shelby MP. Business as usual.

416
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:34,400
The strategy I outlined earlier

417
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:38,040
to rebuild the conventional part
of this business will take time.

418
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,760
- In the meantime...
- Just business as fucking usual.

419
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,480
In the meantime,
it is fortunate that we have maintained

420
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,960
other sources of cash income.

421
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,560
Because until the stock market
recovers, cash is king.

422
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,920
And cash we have.

423
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:52,760
No-one is gonna hang you, Tommy.

424
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,280
You're gonna hang yourself.

425
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:59,760
Someone has to pay for them
paintings on your wall, Ada.

426
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,240
Yeah, bye-bye, Ada.

427
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,600
Tommy, you need to go easy on Ada.

428
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,600
Polly...

429
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:11,440
...when am I ever not easy on Ada, eh?

430
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:19,720
Thomas, the thing is, Ada...

431
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,840
- She's pregnant.
- (SPLUTTERS)

432
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,760
Ada's what?

433
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:29,320
These days, people tell me things
without even speaking.

434
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,640
ARTHUR: Wait a minute.

435
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,880
Wait a minute.

436
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,920
Ada's fucking pregnant? Hm?

437
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:41,000
And, Polly, you need to reassure Ada
that it's 1929, times have changed,

438
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:43,920
we've a lot to do, and no-one gives a fuck
who the father is.

439
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,160
Really?

440
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:48,640
I already know who the father is.

441
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:52,600
But we've had enough shocks for one day.

442
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,320
OK.

443
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,040
All right, go on, then.

444
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,880
How long you known about Ada, huh?

445
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,200
I know her doctor.

446
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,400
He calls me.

447
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:22,120
Yeah, longer than me.

448
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,240
Have a look at this.

449
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:32,920
What's that funny writing on there?

450
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:34,480
Chinese.

451
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,040
Ah, right.

452
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,840
What is it? Hmm?

453
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,400
Bad news?

454
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,560
Maybe.

455
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,480
Angels of Retribution?

456
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:49,720
Yeah.

457
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:52,200
Burn the letter they sent.

458
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,640
It's already done.

459
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,680
Look at that, Tom. Hm?

460
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:04,320
Pulled from our brother, eh?

461
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,760
Finally took a first bullet.

462
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,760
No-one fucking listens to me.

463
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,920
Here, give it here.

464
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,400
I'll keep it for him.

465
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:21,040
- I still have my first one.
- (CHUCKLES)

466
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:32,720
Arthur, you can tell our comrades
they can come back in.

467
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,240
Where are you going, brother?

468

MP: The huge losses
on the British Stock Exchange

469
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:17,560
will bite into our economy
for the foreseeable future.

470
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:22,800
I therefore must ask the trade unions
to possess understanding.

471
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:26,680
The need for their flexibility
and cooperation is paramount

472
00:37:26,720 --> 00:37:30,840
in the coming months as we attempt
to rebuild this great nation.

473
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,720
(MURMURS OF ASSENT)

474
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,160
SPEAKER: Mr Thomas Shelby.

475
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:39,040
Thank you, Mr Speaker.

476
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:44,760
My right honourable friend,
the member for Epping,

477
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,960
asks that following the crash,

478
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:52,240
trade union members be more flexible
when carrying out their duties.

479
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:57,400
What he's really asking
is that the working man carry the can.

480
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:03,560
The grand casino in Monte Carlo
is a small and timid affair

481
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:08,720
when compared to the wild games of chance
being played in London and New York

482
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:14,000
by gamblers in silk gloves and beaver
hats, who, when they lose their bets,

483
00:38:14,040 --> 00:38:16,360
turn around and ask the shoe-shine
to pay for it.

484
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,640
(LAUGHTER)

485
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,600
Well, on behalf of the shoe-shines
and can carriers of South Birmingham

486
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:25,160
and all across Great Britain,
I would suggest

487
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,400
that those who so recklessly lost
their fortunes on the capitalist lottery

488
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:32,880
- learn to shine their own shoes...
- (MURMURS OF ASSENT)

489
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:36,080
...carry their own can
and pay their own bills.

(CHEERING)

491
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,000
Mr Shelby?

492
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:49,360
I just wanted to say
how much I enjoyed your speech.

493
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,960
You speak very eloquently.

494
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,800
Thank you.

00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:57,400
My name's Mosley, by the way.
Oswald Mosley.

496
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,480
Yeah, I know who you are.

00:38:58,520 --> 00:39:00,880
My constituency borders yours.

498
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:04,280
And let me just say,
you've come to my attention.

- (KNOCK ON DOOR)
- Come.

500
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,640
Ah.

501
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,800

on completion of business.

My wife and I have had a misfortune
on the London Exchange.

505
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:35,000
There's 20 there.

506
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,880
You'll have to wait for the rest.

(SIGHS HEAVILY)

508
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,840
Cavalry, eh?

509
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,760
Mm.

510
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:53,840
Huh!

511
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,160
Yeah.

512
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:59,720
I spent a long of time
waiting for the cavalry, me.

513
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:06,920
One time, me and my comrades
waited three days.

514
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,680
When the cavalry finally came,

515
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:13,440
an officer,
on the back of a fine white horse,

516
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:18,240
joked that he'd been delayed
playing a game of whist.

517
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:23,320
So I took out my Webley revolver
and I shot him in the head,

518
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,120
stole his horse,
reported him for cowardice.

519
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,760
All for a game of chance.

520
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:34,960
After my people completed their task
in Chinatown,

521
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:38,760
they collected all the photographs,
letters and cheques

522
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,960
that will cause you concern.

523
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:43,240
I now have them in a safe place.

524
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:49,040
On Monday, you will give me
the full £50,000 in cash...

525
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,840
...or I will steal your white horse
from under you.

526
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:58,840
How the fuck did a man like you
get into a position of trust

527
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,520
in a place of power and privilege?

528
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,000
A man like me?

529
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:08,760
A man like me?

530
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:12,120
Lord Suckerby.

531
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:13,560
I've seen the photographs.

532
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:17,240
Monday.

533
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,640
(SHOUTS) Shelby!

534
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,680
Sorry I'm late, Ada.

535
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:31,480
We've been having briefings
from the Home Office.

536
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,880
The police are concerned about the effect
of the crash in industrial areas.

537
00:41:34,920 --> 00:41:37,240
- Right.
- Everything all right?

538
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,880
Yeah, fine.

539
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:41,240
We lost money in New York,
so I've been up late.

540
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,360
Your brother been busy?

541
00:41:44,320 --> 00:41:47,880
Er, he's had two meetings with
Mr Shapurji Saklatvala,

542
00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:50,000
the former Communist MP
for Battersea.

543
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:52,720
He's been approached
by an anarchist group in Walsall -

544
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,960
he's setting up a meeting -

545
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,040
and there's talk of a mass walk-out
of bus drivers, Nottingham and Derby,

546
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:02,800
organised by two Communist convenors
not formerly known to Special Branch.

547
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,840
He's also had a telephone conversation
with Jessie Eden,

548
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,480
who is organising a committee
to resist wage cuts across the city.

549
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:12,000
But he'll report more when he sees her.

550
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,240
It's all in there, though.

551
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,800
Names and everything.

552
00:42:14,840 --> 00:42:17,560
I heard he had the Labour benches
roaring approval in the House today.

553
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:21,240
Huh. If only he meant it,
he'd be dangerous.

554
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,600
Didn't know you drank stout, Ada.
Thought it was gin.

555
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,640
Times are hard.

556
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,160
Hm.

557
00:42:32,080 --> 00:42:34,280
Exactly how much did you lose?

558
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:38,000
Don't worry about it. Tommy has a plan.

559
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:42,160
He thinks that we can turn the collapse
of the stock exchange to our advantage.

560
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,720
He says, "When others retreat,
you advance."

561
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,080
He says, "We can wave cash in the faces
of desperate men."

562
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:53,680
Tell your brother from me,
he's doing excellent work.

563
00:42:53,720 --> 00:42:58,080
I'm told two more military contracts
for vehicles

564
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:01,120
and parts for the Army in India
are on their way to him.

565
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,760
(EXHALES)

566
00:43:17,800 --> 00:43:18,800
Fuck.

567
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,720
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)
- Come.

568
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:29,360
Mr Shelby, this arrived from New York.

569
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,040
It's from Winston Churchill.

570
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:35,800
He says he was in New York
and had dinner with Charlie Chaplin

571
00:43:35,840 --> 00:43:38,120
and Chaplin mentioned your name.

572
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:41,080
So he was in New York
and he doesn't mention the crash.

573
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,600
No. Even though, in the bar last night,

574
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:48,520
Mr Churchill's private secretary
reckoned he lost £75,000 in two hours.

575
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:51,760
And you?

576
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:56,440
Were you affected, Mr Shelby?

577
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,840
I'm going to my apartment, Adam.

578
00:43:58,880 --> 00:43:59,880
You lock up.

579
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,960
Sorry, Mr Shelby, you...
you have one more appointment.

580
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,480
You set it yourself.
It's in the diary from last week.

581
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,080
A journalist from the Times.

582
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:09,960
He used to be with
the Birmingham Mail.

583
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:11,840
He sent you some questions.

584
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:13,800
You said you wanted to meet him.

585
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,840
He's outside.

586
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:16,920
Yes.

587
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:19,120
Send him in.

588
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,680
Mr Shelby?
Mr Levitt from the London Times.

589
00:44:27,720 --> 00:44:29,520
Have a seat.

590
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:31,560
Adam, you go home, I'll lock up.

591
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:40,640
Mr Shelby, do you remember me?

592
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,480
No.

593
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:49,400
Once, in Small Heath,
you were burning photographs of the King.

594
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:55,640
- London Times. You've done well.
- As have you, sir, to put it mildly.

595
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:57,880
I sent you a list of questions.

596
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,000
Yeah, I misplaced them.

597
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:03,200
Yeah, well, you have a lot on your plate.

598
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,520
Yes.

599
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,440
All I remember is
that your questions interested me.

600
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,320
Oh!

601
00:45:09,360 --> 00:45:10,640
Good.

602
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:13,680
Sorry, just...

603
00:45:13,720 --> 00:45:15,320
Ah, here we are.

604
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,880
Yes, um... (CLEARS THROAT)

605
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:25,080
Um... So, Mr Shelby,
traditionally in this country,

606
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:30,000
print journalists take no interest in the,
er, the private lives of politicians.

607
00:45:30,040 --> 00:45:32,080
Private lives?

608
00:45:32,120 --> 00:45:36,280
But in these modern times,
especially in America...

609
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:41,160
...journalists are beginning to...
Well, that is to say, yes, um...

610
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:43,080
Readers are beginning to say...

611
00:45:44,120 --> 00:45:47,440
...want to know more about the men
who represent them.

612
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,840
Of course.

613
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,800
In these modern times.

614
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:55,240
Whereas before it would have
been seen as ungentlemanly to, er,

615
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:59,160
to ask a public figure questions
about personal matters

616
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,160
- or business affairs.
- Oh, well. No need to worry.

617
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:03,720
I'm no gentleman.

618
00:46:07,520 --> 00:46:08,680
Hm.

619
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,120
Er, Mr Shelby,
as I said in my letter,

620
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:14,880
ten years ago I was a journalist
on the Birmingham Evening Mail.

621
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,320
And of course, working in that city,

622
00:46:19,360 --> 00:46:22,160
it was impossible
not to know your name...

623
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:26,240
...and your reputation.

624
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:32,080
(EXHALES) So, when I saw that you had
been elected as a socialist...

625
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:33,520
You reflected on the fact

626
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:39,240
that working people can indeed change
their lives for the better...

627
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:44,960
...channel their abilities in new
directions, discover better methods,

628
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,440
aim for happier outcomes,
even win awards for industry.

629
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,320
You can write this down, Mr Levitt.

630
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:55,760
The question I have for you,
Mr Shelby, is this.

631
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:02,280
Was your conversion from bookmaker
to socialist politician

632
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,200
a gradual thing or...

633
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:10,120
...a road to Damascus experience?

634
00:47:11,200 --> 00:47:12,960
Yeah.

635
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,880
Now I hear that question...

636
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,480
...I remember receiving your letters

637
00:47:18,520 --> 00:47:21,680
and I distinctly remember your use
of the word "bookmaker".

638
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:26,280
- Were you not a bookmaker, sir?
- Yes.

639
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:30,680
I gained a licence
in 1919 for on-track betting.

640
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:32,040
But, since 1923,

641
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:35,600
I've made my fortune in the manufacture,
sale and export of motor cars.

642
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:37,160
And lately gin.

643
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,680
And lately three new homes
for orphaned children.

644
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:45,400
You can write all this down, Mr Levitt.

645
00:47:46,680 --> 00:47:49,400
I have another question, Mr Shelby.

646
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,000
In Birmingham,
at the time that I was there,

647
00:47:54,040 --> 00:47:56,280
there was a Major Campbell.

648
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:58,800
He was found dead.

649
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,880
A member of your family was charged.

650
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,160
(CHUCKLES)

651
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,040
Right, you answer me this.
Answer me this.

652
00:48:16,480 --> 00:48:20,120
What is your Tory newspaper
more afraid of?

653
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,760
Is it evolution or revolution?

654
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:26,400
And what is it about
working-class men like me,

655
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,880
standing up in the House of Commons
and speaking from the heart,

656
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:35,000
what is it that so troubles you
that you would try to undermine me?

657
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,360
I am talking about specific events, sir.

658
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:38,400
Which I don't recall...

659
00:48:39,840 --> 00:48:42,600
...with which I was never
personally linked,

660
00:48:42,640 --> 00:48:46,120
and after which
all convictions were quashed.

661
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:57,600
Yeah, now...
I recall receiving your letter...

662
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:01,040
...and I recall that when I did...

663
00:49:02,560 --> 00:49:06,880
...I asked a colleague of mine
to carry out some research.

664
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:10,800
Just a moment.

665
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,880
Here we are. (EXHALES)

666
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,080
Ah, Michael Levitt.

667
00:49:30,120 --> 00:49:31,120
Correct?

668
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:34,600
- Yes.
- Yes.

669
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:36,160
Journalist.

670
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:38,280
Unmarried.

671
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:40,160
An apartment in Maida Vale.

672
00:49:41,160 --> 00:49:44,680
An apartment opposite
the underground station.

673
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:49,600
"Unmarried" is underlined.

674
00:49:49,640 --> 00:49:52,800
Mr Levitt enjoys walks in the park.

675
00:49:52,840 --> 00:49:54,440
Sometimes alone.

676
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:56,520
Sometimes not alone.

677
00:49:58,080 --> 00:50:00,320
Sometimes with other men.

678
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:10,360
Sometimes with other men.

679
00:50:13,120 --> 00:50:16,840
I'm old-fashioned...Michael.

680
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:20,480
I believe private lives
should remain private.

681
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:24,160
Not everything modern is good, now, is it?

682
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:29,800
You gonna write this down...

683
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,360
...in your little fucking book?

684
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:43,040
Well?

685
00:50:43,080 --> 00:50:44,960
Not yet.

686
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,760
I didn't tell him.

687
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,080
Him knowing or not knowing
has no relevance to what we're drinking.

688
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:52,640
It's vintage.

689
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:57,360
- Fuck it.
- (CHUCKLES)

690
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:58,720
This...

691
00:51:00,440 --> 00:51:01,680
...is for us.

692
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:05,560
Let's drink to the baby.

693
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:10,360
Polly, do you remember
when I was last pregnant?

694
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:14,920
You were going to take me to Cardiff.

695
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,920
I was going to get rid of it.

696
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:19,200
What about this time?

697
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,000
Imagine.

698
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:28,360
The father's scared.

699
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,160
He runs away.

700
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:31,360
You're left.

701
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,720
Oh, sweetheart.

702
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:40,960
The baby's black,
he's a bastard and it's Birmingham.

703
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:43,920
But you don't care.

704
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,440
Because the world has changed.

705
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:51,280
And the baby's eyes are golden.

706
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:56,080
And you're gonna leave her with
Aunt Polly every day to look after.

707
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:59,440
Aunt Polly, who insisted
that you called her Elizabeth.

708
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,640
How do you know it's a her?

709
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:04,800
Cos I'm Polly Gray.

710
00:52:04,840 --> 00:52:06,680
It's a girl?

711
00:52:06,720 --> 00:52:07,720
Golden.

712
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:12,280
To be born in the year 1930,

713
00:52:12,320 --> 00:52:15,040
where everything will be changed
for the better.

714
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,680
She'll be the colour of a Hollywood Oscar.

715
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:24,360
What will Tommy say?

716
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,240
Tommy knows.

717
00:52:32,600 --> 00:52:34,000
Hmm!

718
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:38,760
He's also seen that the world's
big and round and he says, "So what?"

719
00:52:43,760 --> 00:52:45,880
Tommy is right, you know, Ada.

720
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:49,720
We are flying above the rules now.

721
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,120
We're bold people, aren't we, Polly?

722
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,040
That's the beauty.

723
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,480
Hello, Cyril.

724
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:17,200
Least you're still talking to me.

725
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,320
Where is everyone?

726
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:30,240
Your wife is upstairs with Ruby.

727
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:40,040
You know, Frances, if there were to be
a snap election in this house today...

728
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:42,920
...wouldn't win it...

729
00:53:43,960 --> 00:53:46,880
...not even if I were running
against the devil himself.

730
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:47,920
No.

731
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,160
- I gathered.
- Mm.

732
00:53:51,880 --> 00:53:53,560
Where's Charles?

733
00:53:53,600 --> 00:53:54,840
Charles is in the stable.

734
00:53:56,960 --> 00:53:58,280
Thank you.

735
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:16,680
(CLEARS THROAT)

736
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:19,720
Did Arthur explain?

737
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,600
He said it's God's will.

738
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,080
But you're not God!

739
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:37,960
(SIGHS) No, I'm not God.

740
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,040
Not yet.
