1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,035
<i>Last time my friend,
Chelsea, set me up</i>

2
00:00:05,102 --> 00:00:08,037
<i>with one of her friends,
I had to get a tetanus shot.</i>

3
00:00:08,238 --> 00:00:10,039
<i>But Molly
is different.</i>

4
00:00:11,107 --> 00:00:12,808
Hey, you know
what would be fun?

5
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:15,878
Call Chelsea,
tell her I stood you up

6
00:00:15,946 --> 00:00:17,512
and... pretend
you're crying.

7
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:19,381
Spencer,
I couldn't do that.

8
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:20,682
Oh, come on.

9
00:00:20,750 --> 00:00:21,951
I can't.

10
00:00:22,018 --> 00:00:24,486
I've never done a practical
joke in my entire life.

11
00:00:24,554 --> 00:00:25,387
Get out.

12
00:00:25,455 --> 00:00:26,555
You've never
called up a store

13
00:00:26,622 --> 00:00:28,890
and asked for, uh,
Oliver Clothesoff?

14
00:00:28,958 --> 00:00:29,924
Make Apeepee?

15
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,727
Never.
Ever, ever.

16
00:00:31,794 --> 00:00:32,728
Come on.

17
00:00:32,795 --> 00:00:33,729
What are you
doing?

18
00:00:33,796 --> 00:00:34,730
No guts, no glory.

19
00:00:34,797 --> 00:00:35,731
No, no, no, no-

20
00:00:35,798 --> 00:00:36,565
Here we go.

21
00:00:36,632 --> 00:00:37,599
What are you
doing?

22
00:00:37,867 --> 00:00:38,767
It's ringing.

23
00:00:38,835 --> 00:00:39,634
I'm nervous,
I'm gonna pee.

24
00:00:46,742 --> 00:00:47,675
Hello?

25
00:00:47,876 --> 00:00:49,176
Chelsea,
it's Molly.

26
00:00:49,244 --> 00:00:50,911
<i>Listen, I am,
I am so sorry</i>

27
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:52,913
<i>that I set you up
with him, okay?</i>

28
00:00:52,981 --> 00:00:54,147
<i>But my intentions
were good</i>

29
00:00:54,215 --> 00:00:56,850
and you need to think
of Spenny as a trial run

30
00:00:56,917 --> 00:00:59,085
and a way of getting
you back out there.

31
00:00:59,152 --> 00:01:00,353
Okay, do you
forgive me?

32
00:01:00,421 --> 00:01:01,688
I can't fib,
I'm sorry!

33
00:01:02,089 --> 00:01:02,689
Chelsea!

34
00:01:02,757 --> 00:01:03,656
<i>Yeah?</i>

35
00:01:03,724 --> 00:01:05,425
We're having
a great time!

36
00:01:05,626 --> 00:01:06,526
What?

37
00:01:06,594 --> 00:01:07,861
<i>Yeah!
He's, um, kind</i>

38
00:01:07,928 --> 00:01:10,096
and sweet
and funny.

39
00:01:10,431 --> 00:01:11,631
Ask to see his ID.

40
00:01:11,699 --> 00:01:13,365
<i>Do you want
to speak to him?</i>

41
00:01:13,433 --> 00:01:14,466
<i>No, not really.</i>

42
00:01:15,101 --> 00:01:16,201
Chelsea!

43
00:01:16,269 --> 00:01:17,703
<i>Spenny, what
did you do to her?</i>

44
00:01:18,004 --> 00:01:19,271
Did you spike
her tea?

45
00:01:19,338 --> 00:01:21,707
I knew I shouldn't have
told you she doesn't drink!

46
00:01:21,775 --> 00:01:23,375
<i>Molly is a sweet
and vulnerable girl,</i>

47
00:01:23,443 --> 00:01:24,443
<i>do not hurt her!</i>

48
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:26,211
Chels, relax,
everything's going great.

49
00:01:26,279 --> 00:01:28,446
You might have made
a match in heaven here.

50
00:01:28,514 --> 00:01:30,214
Oh, I wanna
believe you, I do,

51
00:01:30,282 --> 00:01:32,650
I really do, but like,
she's my only friend

52
00:01:32,718 --> 00:01:34,652
other than you.
so I swear to fu-

53
00:01:35,954 --> 00:01:37,054
What'd she say?

54
00:01:37,255 --> 00:01:38,188
Over the moon.

55
00:01:38,657 --> 00:01:39,857
So am I.

56
00:01:40,258 --> 00:01:41,191
Me too.

57
00:01:42,461 --> 00:01:43,160
Ugh!!!

58
00:01:45,463 --> 00:01:47,731
I wonder if we'll like
the same appetizers.

59
00:01:47,932 --> 00:01:48,799
I bet we do.

60
00:01:49,133 --> 00:01:50,199
You know what?

61
00:01:50,267 --> 00:01:52,569
Okay, on the count of 3
we're both gonna say

62
00:01:52,637 --> 00:01:54,070
what we're gonna
order, out loud...

63
00:01:58,075 --> 00:02:00,509
If we pick the same
thing, I am gonna die.

64
00:02:01,077 --> 00:02:02,010
Um-

65
00:02:02,412 --> 00:02:04,379
Can you excuse
me for just a sec?

66
00:02:04,581 --> 00:02:05,448
Okay!

67
00:02:05,515 --> 00:02:06,281
You can think
about it.

68
00:02:08,418 --> 00:02:09,251
Huh.

69
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,686
If it isn't
the devil's spawn.

70
00:02:10,754 --> 00:02:13,489
Last time I heard that voice
it was begging for mercy.

71
00:02:14,591 --> 00:02:15,558
Hello, Spencer.

72
00:02:15,926 --> 00:02:17,358
What did you order
for dinner?

73
00:02:17,426 --> 00:02:18,726
Entrails from
your last victim?

74
00:02:18,794 --> 00:02:19,894
Run along.

75
00:02:20,095 --> 00:02:21,362
This is
my social time.

76
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:23,631
You know, if I had a
sledgehammer, I'd smash

77
00:02:23,699 --> 00:02:26,033
that rotten divorce
lawyer skull of yours.

78
00:02:26,101 --> 00:02:28,202
I'll give you five
minutes in the hallway,

79
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:29,938
then I file
a restraining order.

80
00:02:38,112 --> 00:02:40,380
Where do you get off
ruining my dinner date?

81
00:02:40,448 --> 00:02:41,515
Your dinner date?

82
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:43,149
Where do you get off
ruining my life?

83
00:02:43,217 --> 00:02:45,151
You said things about me
that were unconscionable!

84
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:46,653
You lied about me
in court!

85
00:02:46,721 --> 00:02:49,154
I was hired by your
wife to do a job!

86
00:02:49,222 --> 00:02:51,423
Do you have a fetish
for watching me sob?

87
00:02:51,492 --> 00:02:54,159
Truthfully, crushing you
in court gave me

88
00:02:54,227 --> 00:02:56,261
a power rush
so intense,

89
00:02:56,329 --> 00:02:58,931
I actually had
an orgasm.

90
00:02:58,999 --> 00:03:00,099
You did?

91
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:12,343
♪

92
00:03:12,411 --> 00:03:13,512
What's
happening?

93
00:03:13,713 --> 00:03:17,348
♪

94
00:03:22,253 --> 00:03:23,521
You destroyed
me in court!

95
00:03:23,588 --> 00:03:24,855
I hate you,
divorce lawyer!

96
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:26,924
Ahhhhhhh!

97
00:03:32,964 --> 00:03:34,698
I hate you!
That feels good!

98
00:03:34,766 --> 00:03:35,365
CRASH!

99
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:36,366
Oh, my god!

100
00:03:41,104 --> 00:03:42,371
Oh, I picked
my appetizer!

101
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,541
Did you
pick yours?

102
00:03:44,775 --> 00:03:45,708
Uh...

103
00:03:46,443 --> 00:03:47,544
Are you okay?

104
00:03:47,945 --> 00:03:48,711
Yeah, great.

105
00:03:48,779 --> 00:03:49,712
Good!

106
00:03:51,114 --> 00:03:52,214
<i>You look rosy.</i>

107
00:03:54,284 --> 00:03:55,518
<i>My name is Spenny.</i>

108
00:03:55,585 --> 00:03:58,584
<i>I've been accused of being
an "Emotionally Stunted Manchild".</i>

109
00:03:58,585 --> 00:04:01,657
<i>incapable of having

110
00:04:01,724 --> 00:04:03,992
<i>And it's all because

111
00:04:04,394 --> 00:04:05,594

113
00:04:10,886 --> 00:04:15,588
Chelsea, I had dirty sex with my
ex-wife's lawyer, in a bathroom.

114
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:16,772
You're my best friend.

115
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,107
Try not to be
judgemental.

116
00:04:18,308 --> 00:04:19,608
Are you an animal?

117
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:20,709
In human form?

118
00:04:21,078 --> 00:04:22,411
I don't know
what happened.

119
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:23,545
I hate that lawyer.

120
00:04:24,114 --> 00:04:26,547
I hate that lawyer with
every fiber of my being!

121
00:04:26,748 --> 00:04:29,017
When Molly was left
at the altar ten months ago,

122
00:04:29,085 --> 00:04:31,252
I'm the one who pushed
her into dating again.

123
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:33,388
You know, to build
her self-esteem.

124
00:04:33,655 --> 00:04:35,256
She didn't want to,
I insisted!

125
00:04:35,458 --> 00:04:37,525
It was like being
caught up in a hurricane.

126
00:04:37,593 --> 00:04:38,860
I was powerless!

127
00:04:39,095 --> 00:04:41,029
Did the hurricane blow
your fly down too?

128
00:04:41,663 --> 00:04:42,964
You can't tell Molly.

129
00:04:43,031 --> 00:04:44,131
Don't tell Molly.

130
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,466
Ugh!

131
00:04:47,202 --> 00:04:48,803
Well, I, I can't
tell her!

132
00:04:49,705 --> 00:04:50,838
I'm implicated
in this!

133
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:54,141
Chelsea!

134
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:56,310
I have to go
into hiding.

135
00:05:01,549 --> 00:05:03,683
<i>Spencer I'm going
to need a DNA sample,</i>

136
00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:04,684
a hair will do.

137
00:05:04,752 --> 00:05:06,185
You know,
just to make sure

138
00:05:06,253 --> 00:05:08,187
<i>once and for all that
you're really mine.</i>

139
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:10,423
I don't want to have this
conversation again, please.

140
00:05:10,491 --> 00:05:12,659
Don't you want to
put your mind at ease?

141
00:05:12,727 --> 00:05:13,927
I found a new lab.

142
00:05:13,995 --> 00:05:15,427
I have real
problems right now.

143
00:05:15,495 --> 00:05:17,162
I need to get in
to see Schneiderman.

144
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:18,296
Oh, honey.

145
00:05:18,364 --> 00:05:19,665
You can't just
walk in off the street

146
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:20,733
and see Schneiderman.

147
00:05:21,167 --> 00:05:22,100
Tell me about it.

148
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:23,836
I'm not gonna tell
you about it,

149
00:05:23,904 --> 00:05:24,837
you're not
a psychiatrist.

150
00:05:24,905 --> 00:05:26,605
I may not even
be your mother.

151
00:05:26,907 --> 00:05:28,874
Okay, I'll tell ya
what happened.

152
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:31,709
The other night I was
at a restaurant on a date

153
00:05:31,777 --> 00:05:34,111
with this girl, Molly,
who I absolutely adore.

154
00:05:34,413 --> 00:05:36,848
I look across the room
and I see another woman

155
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,850
who I despise,
I hate her guts.

156
00:05:39,051 --> 00:05:41,118
The next thing I know,
I'm in the washroom

157
00:05:41,186 --> 00:05:42,186
having sex
with her

158
00:05:42,254 --> 00:05:44,689
and the sex was
unbelievable.

159
00:05:45,457 --> 00:05:46,490
I feel terrible.

160
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:47,858
You had
revenge sex.

161
00:05:47,926 --> 00:05:49,826
If having great sex
with someone you loathe

162
00:05:49,894 --> 00:05:51,828
is revenge sex,
I had it all right.

163
00:05:51,896 --> 00:05:53,830
Yeah, and you're
dying to do it again.

164
00:05:53,898 --> 00:05:54,830
Blah, blah, blah.

165
00:05:55,032 --> 00:05:56,866
What are you?
Schneiderman's secretary?

166
00:05:57,201 --> 00:05:59,869
This girl, Molly,
she's the real deal.

167
00:05:59,937 --> 00:06:02,138
I could marry this girl,
have children with her.

168
00:06:02,206 --> 00:06:04,207
I really think you should
be more supportive,

169
00:06:04,275 --> 00:06:06,809
so please, get me into
see Schneiderman!

170
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:08,211
Are you kidding?

171
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,979
I brought him revenge
sex twenty years ago.

172
00:06:10,047 --> 00:06:11,980
Now maybe if the girl
was you sister.

173
00:06:16,386 --> 00:06:17,586
<i>Isn't
snuggling good?</i>

174
00:06:19,122 --> 00:06:20,055
It's terrific.

175
00:06:21,391 --> 00:06:23,024
People jump
right into sex

176
00:06:23,093 --> 00:06:25,427
and overlook the joy
of intimate snuggling.

177
00:06:26,562 --> 00:06:28,262
Yeah, they do that
quite a bit.

178
00:06:28,897 --> 00:06:30,664
When we do
finally have sex,

179
00:06:30,732 --> 00:06:32,166
it'll have so much
more meaning.

180
00:06:33,068 --> 00:06:34,135
There's no rush,
right?

181
00:06:34,903 --> 00:06:36,003
No, there's
no rush.

182
00:06:37,906 --> 00:06:40,408
Sex is just a... teeny part
of a relationship.

183
00:06:42,077 --> 00:06:44,177
Sometimes I don't
think about it at all.

184
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,246
Me too.

185
00:06:49,183 --> 00:06:50,383
<i>Say it again!</i>

186
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:52,119
You embarrassed
me in court, you dirty lawyer!

187
00:06:52,186 --> 00:06:53,120
Ugh...

188
00:07:00,527 --> 00:07:02,995
Well, if it isn't the
quivering little man-child.

189
00:07:03,062 --> 00:07:04,296
You back for more
punishment?

190
00:07:04,531 --> 00:07:07,065
<i>Look, this has to stop,
whatever this is.</i>

191
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:09,135
What's wrong?
You scared?

192
00:07:09,336 --> 00:07:11,403
<i>I'm not scared;
I just want you to know</i>

193
00:07:11,471 --> 00:07:13,606
I'm in a relationship that
actually means something!

194
00:07:13,873 --> 00:07:15,140
So why
are you here?

195
00:07:15,207 --> 00:07:16,642
<i>I'm here to
tell you something,</i>

196
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:18,143
<i>let me be
clear about this,</i>

197
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:19,444
I hate your guts!

198
00:07:19,512 --> 00:07:21,647
That's what I was trying
to tell you the night

199
00:07:21,714 --> 00:07:23,649
we had the best
sex of our lives.

200
00:07:23,883 --> 00:07:24,816
Your life maybe.

201
00:07:25,551 --> 00:07:26,317
What?

202
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,219
Could have
been better.

203
00:07:28,287 --> 00:07:29,287
Really?

204
00:07:30,889 --> 00:07:32,823
Oh, I know what
you're trying to do.

205
00:07:32,891 --> 00:07:34,158
Well it's not
gonna happen.

206
00:07:34,225 --> 00:07:35,926
You're looking at
a sexual brick wall.

207
00:07:36,762 --> 00:07:38,796
Sex should be
about love, not hate.

208
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:40,898
It's awful.

209
00:07:40,966 --> 00:07:42,099
That's why they
call it making love.

210
00:07:42,734 --> 00:07:43,668
Don't you think?

211
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,537
Oh, what the hell.

212
00:07:48,172 --> 00:07:49,105
I hate you!

213
00:07:50,407 --> 00:07:52,542
I'm going to show you
just how much I hate you!

214
00:07:52,609 --> 00:07:53,777
<i>You know,
ruined my life!</i>

215
00:07:53,844 --> 00:07:56,612
Spencer, I am in heaven
when I am with you.

216
00:07:57,181 --> 00:07:57,947
Oh-

217
00:07:59,116 --> 00:08:00,216
I'm in heaven when
I'm with you too, Molly.

218
00:08:00,417 --> 00:08:02,451
You know, I thought
when I was stood up

219
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:04,452
at the altar, that all
men were bastards.

220
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:06,421
But not you.

221
00:08:07,123 --> 00:08:08,724
Ha, not me-

222
00:08:10,526 --> 00:08:11,459
Say it again!

223
00:08:12,195 --> 00:08:14,296
Sick lawyer,
I hate you!

224
00:08:14,363 --> 00:08:16,065
I know,
I know! Say it again!

225
00:08:21,203 --> 00:08:23,304
Hi!!!

226
00:08:24,707 --> 00:08:26,273
Aw, look at this!

227
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:28,242
You look terrible.

228
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:30,178
Oh, I haven't been
sleeping thanks to you.

229
00:08:33,215 --> 00:08:33,981
So...

230
00:08:34,882 --> 00:08:36,083
You guys
are still together?

231
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:38,952
Chelsea, Spenny
is a great big

232
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,021
hunk of goodness
and he's all mine.

233
00:08:41,222 --> 00:08:42,155
Thanks to you.

234
00:08:42,223 --> 00:08:43,656
Oh, don't
pin it on me.

235
00:08:43,891 --> 00:08:44,991
Aw, she's
so selfless.

236
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:46,860
So you gonna
tell her?

237
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:49,129
We've got
good news.

238
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,463
You have news?

239
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:52,297
We're getting
married!

240
00:08:54,334 --> 00:08:55,634
Oh, my god!

241
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,937
I'm so excited,

242
00:08:58,004 --> 00:08:59,605
I'm gonna go call
mom and tell her.

243
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:00,840
Oh, go call
your mom-

244
00:09:00,907 --> 00:09:02,608
Say hi to her
for me, please.

245
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:05,377
I am crazy
about her!

246
00:09:05,445 --> 00:09:06,678
Have you flipped
your lid?

247
00:09:06,746 --> 00:09:08,179
You asked her
to marry you?

248
00:09:08,247 --> 00:09:09,914
You've known her
for a few days

249
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:11,649
and in that time
you had sex

250
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:12,650
with your
ex-wife's lawyer!

251
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,618
Only two times.

252
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:14,285
Twice!

253
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:15,419
Twiceish.

254
00:09:15,487 --> 00:09:17,188
Maybe it was 3 times,
but it doesn't matter.

255
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,957
Important thing
is I've worked it out

256
00:09:19,024 --> 00:09:20,725
of my system,
like a head cold.

257
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,460
Since when did you
take up smoking?

258
00:09:22,527 --> 00:09:23,460
Since I started
over-eating!

259
00:09:24,996 --> 00:09:27,564
Oh gosh!
Mom is so excited!

260
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:29,099
Hi, Midge-Midge!

261
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:30,533
It's your future
son-in-law!

262
00:09:30,802 --> 00:09:31,735
He's so cute.

263
00:09:35,706 --> 00:09:37,174
<i>Oh, Chels!</i>

264
00:09:37,242 --> 00:09:39,408
You're so happy
for us you're crying!

265
00:09:39,609 --> 00:09:40,442
I am.

266
00:09:40,878 --> 00:09:42,145
And more
exciting news.

267
00:09:42,212 --> 00:09:44,147
Mom is so excited,
she said she wants

268
00:09:44,214 --> 00:09:46,649
this wedding to be even
bigger than the last one.

269
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:48,217
She's gonna re-mortgage
her house again!

270
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:53,622
<i>You think you can
end it just like that,</i>

271
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:55,490
you spineless
gape-jaw?

272
00:09:55,825 --> 00:09:57,759
You don't have the
power to end this.

273
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,561
You're too weak,
you haven't got the guts!

274
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:02,898
<i>I'm doing the right thing.</i>

275
00:10:02,965 --> 00:10:04,499
I know everything
about you.

276
00:10:05,067 --> 00:10:07,002
<i>I'm engaged to be married
to an angel,</i>

277
00:10:07,069 --> 00:10:09,271
<i>and I don't need this
she-beast in my life.</i>

278
00:10:09,738 --> 00:10:11,505
And how you hid
underneath the bed

279
00:10:11,572 --> 00:10:12,840
during lightening
storms,

280
00:10:12,908 --> 00:10:14,508
I humiliated you
in court!

281
00:10:14,776 --> 00:10:16,510
I want to tear
your testicles off

282
00:10:16,577 --> 00:10:17,511
and eat them!

283
00:10:19,247 --> 00:10:20,080
You're wet.

284
00:10:21,716 --> 00:10:22,516
And crinkly.

285
00:10:28,088 --> 00:10:29,789
Don't over boil them.
They get mushy.

286
00:10:36,596 --> 00:10:37,530
Now this...

287
00:10:38,265 --> 00:10:40,266
Is gonna look beautiful
on your big day.

288
00:10:40,467 --> 00:10:42,202
You know tan
is the new white?

289
00:10:42,269 --> 00:10:43,202
Is it really?

290
00:10:43,269 --> 00:10:44,369
Okay.

291
00:10:44,437 --> 00:10:46,705
So am I gonna get an
intatation to the wedding?

292
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,773
Um-

293
00:10:48,842 --> 00:10:50,408
We're thinking of putting
you in charge of parking.

294
00:10:50,476 --> 00:10:51,343
Yeah-

295
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:52,644
Well, you know,
I'd be honored.

296
00:10:54,214 --> 00:10:56,681
Are ya gonna miss Spenny
when he moves out, Phil?

297
00:10:56,749 --> 00:10:57,682
Well-

298
00:10:58,017 --> 00:10:59,217
Maybe just
a little bit.

299
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:02,954
Oh, dear...

300
00:11:03,521 --> 00:11:04,555
He's really upset.

301
00:11:05,224 --> 00:11:06,090
He's an idiot.

302
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,658
Oh, Spencer,
go check on him.

303
00:11:10,896 --> 00:11:12,163
<i>Phil, are you
crying?</i>

304
00:11:12,231 --> 00:11:13,397
It was so
sudden!

305
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:15,732
I mean, you didn't give
me any, any warning.

306
00:11:16,234 --> 00:11:17,667
Why would I
give you warning?

307
00:11:17,735 --> 00:11:18,701
You're my neighbor.

308
00:11:18,769 --> 00:11:20,670
Is there any way
you could get a house

309
00:11:20,738 --> 00:11:22,172
with a, with a
finished basement?

310
00:11:22,373 --> 00:11:23,340
No!

311
00:11:23,407 --> 00:11:25,008
Do you wanna maybe,
want to pencil in

312
00:11:25,076 --> 00:11:26,609
weekly BBQ's
or something?

313
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:28,444
Phil, I'm starting
a new chapter

314
00:11:28,512 --> 00:11:29,679
in my life
with Molly.

315
00:11:29,747 --> 00:11:31,680
So you're all finished
with the revenge se-

316
00:11:31,748 --> 00:11:32,848
Sssshhh!
Quiet!

317
00:11:33,549 --> 00:11:34,483
l l right.

318
00:11:35,585 --> 00:11:36,718
Ya slayed
the beast?

319
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,354
Yes, the beast
is dead.

320
00:11:38,654 --> 00:11:40,856
Okay, it's,
it's all about Molly,

321
00:11:40,924 --> 00:11:42,858
and, and not about the
beast anymore, no-

322
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,193
No more-

323
00:11:44,761 --> 00:11:45,961
All those beasts
out there.

324
00:11:46,896 --> 00:11:47,828
What other beasts?

325
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:50,131
If you think about it,

326
00:11:50,199 --> 00:11:52,133
we all get slighted
by lots and lots

327
00:11:52,201 --> 00:11:53,401
of people
in our lives.

328
00:11:53,468 --> 00:11:54,903
And there are
so many instances

329
00:11:54,970 --> 00:11:56,637
where we just
want to get even.

330
00:11:56,705 --> 00:11:57,471
You know?

331
00:11:57,672 --> 00:11:58,806
But, hey,
you don't need

332
00:11:58,874 --> 00:12:01,509
anymore of that
crazy, wild sex stuff.

333
00:12:01,576 --> 00:12:02,543
Ssshh!
Quiet!

334
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,147
Spenny, I love you!

335
00:12:08,549 --> 00:12:09,682
Other beasts!

336
00:12:10,218 --> 00:12:12,652
Yeah, well you know where
you can shove your shirt.

337
00:12:13,221 --> 00:12:14,254
Spenny!

338
00:12:14,322 --> 00:12:16,256
Look, I can't get your
refund from the lady

339
00:12:16,324 --> 00:12:18,525
at the dry cleaner,
she says that the stain

340
00:12:18,592 --> 00:12:20,759
was on the shirt when
you dropped it off-

341
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:23,329
Jessica, I'm doing inventory,
I don't have time for this.

342
00:12:23,397 --> 00:12:24,830
It's just a shirt,
who cares?

343
00:12:24,898 --> 00:12:25,898
Just a shirt?

344
00:12:25,966 --> 00:12:27,566
You're gonna let her
treat you like that?

345
00:12:27,634 --> 00:12:29,568
You're gonna let her
treat you like dirt?

346
00:12:30,570 --> 00:12:31,770
She's treating me
like dirt?

347
00:12:31,838 --> 00:12:33,505
Hell yeah she's
treating you like dirt!

348
00:12:33,573 --> 00:12:35,506
She took your money,
she ruined your shirt

349
00:12:35,574 --> 00:12:38,009
and then she acts like
she's doing you a favour?

350
00:12:38,577 --> 00:12:39,577
She took my money.

351
00:12:39,645 --> 00:12:40,912
She took your money!

352
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,913
She ruined my shirt.

353
00:12:41,981 --> 00:12:43,114
She ruined your shirt!

354
00:12:43,182 --> 00:12:45,350
And she won't let you
park out in front,

355
00:12:45,418 --> 00:12:46,751
not even on a Sunday!

356
00:12:47,686 --> 00:12:48,619
That's it!

357
00:12:49,521 --> 00:12:50,455
Yeah!

358
00:12:51,022 --> 00:12:52,622
You get that refund!

359
00:12:53,691 --> 00:12:56,293
Dry cleaner: No refund,
store credit only!

360

362
00:13:07,431 --> 00:13:10,398
Spen, I'm sorry I'm late,
but I had a faaabulous session

363
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,634
with Dr. Schniederman.

364
00:13:11,835 --> 00:13:13,468
He's not a clock-watcher
like the others.

365
00:13:13,803 --> 00:13:15,738
Did you talk to him
about my problem?

366
00:13:15,805 --> 00:13:16,739
Yeah...

367
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,906
Didn't grab him.

368
00:13:17,974 --> 00:13:19,474
Oh, come on.
Didn't grab him?

369
00:13:19,542 --> 00:13:20,975
Revenge sex

370
00:13:21,176 --> 00:13:23,210
I'll tell ya what
I'm gonna do for you,

371
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:25,279
my dentist,
Dr. Brickman,

372
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:27,148
loves a
good story.

373
00:13:27,215 --> 00:13:28,916
You want me to get
psychiatric help

374
00:13:28,984 --> 00:13:30,184
from a dentist?!

375
00:13:30,252 --> 00:13:31,786
Well, he's more
easily impressed

376
00:13:31,854 --> 00:13:32,887
than Dr. Schniederman

377
00:13:32,955 --> 00:13:34,889
and you end up with
a nice toothbrush.

378
00:13:37,258 --> 00:13:38,591
My jeweler,
Rakov!

379
00:13:38,893 --> 00:13:40,827
Yeah, but you have
to buy a watch...

380
00:13:41,663 --> 00:13:43,329
Ow, ow, ow!

381
00:13:43,397 --> 00:13:45,666
<i>So where are
you at right now?</i>

382
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:46,667
Still with
the lawyer?

383
00:13:47,301 --> 00:13:49,002
Uh uh, I'm done
with the lawyer.

384
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,004
I've moved onto
fair-weather friends,

385
00:13:51,072 --> 00:13:52,338
broken promises
and people

386
00:13:52,406 --> 00:13:54,339
who said they'd help
me move and didn't.

387
00:13:54,908 --> 00:13:55,841
Interesting.

388
00:13:56,409 --> 00:13:58,077
So, is there any
hope for me?

389
00:13:58,411 --> 00:13:59,679
Yeah, there's
always hope.

390
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,581
This impending marriage
with Molly though...

391
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:04,784
That's really
bumpin' me.

392
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:06,018
Hey!

393
00:14:06,586 --> 00:14:08,520
Breaking up with Molly
isn't an option, okay?

394
00:14:08,754 --> 00:14:09,620
<i>Okay, okay-</i>

395
00:14:09,689 --> 00:14:10,922
Just let me
think this over.

396
00:14:11,590 --> 00:14:12,356
Wider.

397
00:14:12,558 --> 00:14:13,792
<i>Relax your jaw.</i>

398
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:15,694
You're gonna have to
hold off on that wedding.

399
00:14:15,761 --> 00:14:16,695
Why?

400
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:19,363
Revenge sex is
like an abscess,

401
00:14:19,431 --> 00:14:21,966
you have to let the
anger drain from you.

402
00:14:22,434 --> 00:14:24,368
And the only way
to do that is-

403
00:14:25,937 --> 00:14:26,970
You know what.

404
00:14:27,038 --> 00:14:29,372
Have sex with every
woman that crossed me?

405
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,607
It's the only way.

406
00:14:32,443 --> 00:14:34,377
You're lookin' good for
someone who never flosses.

407
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:36,279
Make an appointment
on the way out.

408
00:14:37,882 --> 00:14:38,648
Pick a colour.

409
00:14:40,218 --> 00:14:40,983
Yellow.

410
00:14:41,719 --> 00:14:42,651
Interesting.

411
00:14:44,554 --> 00:14:45,487
Spenny on phone: Hello?

412
00:14:45,823 --> 00:14:46,856
Arlene Sheposnik?

413
00:14:47,390 --> 00:14:48,324
It's Spenny.

414
00:14:48,792 --> 00:14:50,492
Hey, yeah.
No, I'm good.

415
00:14:50,694 --> 00:14:52,294
Um, do you remember
in high school

416
00:14:52,362 --> 00:14:54,296
when you poured milk
all over my head

417
00:14:54,364 --> 00:14:55,464
in the cafeteria?

418
00:14:56,266 --> 00:14:58,466
I'd like to get together
and talk about that.

419
00:14:59,401 --> 00:15:00,335
Okay, great.

420
00:15:00,536 --> 00:15:01,502
I'll call you later.

421
00:15:02,905 --> 00:15:04,339
Great lead, Jessica,
way to go.

422
00:15:04,406 --> 00:15:05,607
Hey, I got
somethin', Spenny.

423
00:15:05,674 --> 00:15:07,609
Here's a girl you
went to college with

424
00:15:07,676 --> 00:15:09,344
who dumped you
for the football player.

425
00:15:09,411 --> 00:15:10,846
Sarah Listerman
is married with kids.

426
00:15:10,913 --> 00:15:12,114
What's wrong
with you, Phil?!

427
00:15:12,314 --> 00:15:13,647
Sorry, Spenny.

428
00:15:13,715 --> 00:15:15,182
<i>Do I have to go over
the ground rules again?</i>

429
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,184
We're here to get even
with these people,

430
00:15:17,252 --> 00:15:18,318
not ruin their lives!

431
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:20,087
Okay, but, like,
what if they don't

432
00:15:20,155 --> 00:15:21,355
want you
to bang them?

433
00:15:22,157 --> 00:15:23,457
They're gonna
wanna bang me.

434
00:15:23,524 --> 00:15:25,726
Revenge sex is a ride
you don't pass up.

435
00:15:25,927 --> 00:15:28,295
Do you want both women
and men on the list?

436
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:30,096
That is so dumb!

437
00:15:30,164 --> 00:15:31,731
I'm not even gonna
entertain that question!

438
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:35,902
<i>I know it looks bad,

bedroom at night,

456

00:19:49,073 --> 00:19:51,340
<i>And I've decided-</i>

537
00:19:51,407 --> 00:19:52,608
I forgive Spencer.

538
00:19:53,744 --> 00:19:54,710
What?

539
00:19:54,911 --> 00:19:56,679
Lisa Ungerman
laughed at his penis

540
00:19:56,747 --> 00:19:59,181
and he needed to work
through that pain for me.

541
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:01,784
His heart was in
the right place.

542
00:20:02,252 --> 00:20:03,719
I told you she'd
understand.

543
00:20:04,554 --> 00:20:05,988
She was left
at the altar.

544
00:20:06,422 --> 00:20:08,456
Only people that know
pain can understand

545
00:20:08,524 --> 00:20:10,525
the dark bliss
of revenge sex.

546
00:20:10,926 --> 00:20:12,694
<i>Everyone was
staring at me.</i>

547
00:20:12,762 --> 00:20:14,963
I felt like the biggest
loser in the world.

548
00:20:16,766 --> 00:20:18,700
<i>It was like I just
won first prize</i>

549
00:20:18,768 --> 00:20:20,368
in a not wanted
contest.

550
00:20:20,435 --> 00:20:22,370
Don't go there, Molly,
please, don't go there.

551
00:20:22,437 --> 00:20:23,570
I have to, Spencer.

552
00:20:24,172 --> 00:20:26,140
I can't marry you
until I have sex

553
00:20:26,207 --> 00:20:28,642
with my ex-fiancé,
Mr. Big Jerk.

554
00:20:29,077 --> 00:20:30,177
Sounds fair to me.

555
00:20:32,047 --> 00:20:34,748
And the best manb who didn't
drive him to the church,

556
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,750
And that priest
that snickered.

557
00:20:36,951 --> 00:20:37,751
No, don't!

558
00:20:38,086 --> 00:20:40,319
And that photographer
who kept taking pictures,

559
00:20:40,387 --> 00:20:42,321
and that bridesmaid
who showed a little

560
00:20:42,389 --> 00:20:43,355
too much thigh.

561
00:20:43,557 --> 00:20:44,157
Please!

562
00:20:44,224 --> 00:20:45,124
Button it, Spencer!

563
00:20:45,725 --> 00:20:46,858
It's Molly time.

564
00:20:48,562 --> 00:20:50,496
<i>And so, I lost my
sweet, sweet Molly</i>

565
00:20:50,564 --> 00:20:52,097
<i>to the beast
of revenge sex.</i>

566
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,266
<i>Last I heard she was
revenge-sexing</i>

567
00:20:54,334 --> 00:20:55,834
<i>the balloon twister
who ignored her</i>

568
00:20:55,902 --> 00:20:57,002
<i>on her tenth
birthday.</i>

569
00:20:57,571 --> 00:20:59,572
<i>I guess in the end
it's my fate</i>

570
00:20:59,639 --> 00:21:01,073
<i>to my spend my life
loveless.</i>

571
00:21:01,473 --> 00:21:02,674
You still have me, Spen!

572
00:21:03,242 --> 00:21:05,109
And I'm SO happy!

573
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,514
I think I'm gonna
kill myself.

574
00:21:10,749 --> 00:21:11,683
Yeah...

575
00:21:12,418 --> 00:21:13,351
