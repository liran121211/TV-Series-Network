1
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:09,969
Guys, did anybody stumble?

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,096
Oh, girls!

3
00:00:12,096 --> 00:00:15,015
We arrived stumbling
and knocking over everything.

4
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:17,643
What's up, guys?

5
00:00:17,643 --> 00:00:19,270
Hi, guys!

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:21,313
- I missed you!
- How are you, Lexa?

7
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:22,314
Are you okay?

8
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:26,235
What's up, guys?

9
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,028
How are you?

10
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:30,573
Fabulous!

11
00:00:31,157 --> 00:00:33,451
Guys, today things are gonna get wild!

12
00:00:33,451 --> 00:00:34,577
Really wild!

13
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:36,704
Today it's gonna be ma real mess!

14
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:38,080
Like every other day!

15
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,707
Exactly!

16
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:43,961
Yes. Today we'll get to see
what we've been waiting for, you know?

17
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:45,629
I'm very anxious.

18
00:00:45,629 --> 00:00:49,133
I want a new party, story,
intrigue, another couple...

19
00:00:49,133 --> 00:00:52,720
Bia did more things in one night
than in the whole vacation.

20
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,723
Looks like she's free, right?

21
00:00:55,723 --> 00:00:58,476
Guys, I'm not judging
because I'd do the same.

22
00:00:58,476 --> 00:01:01,479
- No, you wouldn't, you'd do worse.
- Guys...

23
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:04,774
I imagined she'd hook up
with just one guy,

24
00:01:04,774 --> 00:01:08,068
but she kissed two guys
in just one night. Guys, yummy!

25
00:01:09,153 --> 00:01:13,115
She's beautiful, single,
free, independent, why not?

26
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:14,241
Why not?

27
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,076
I loved it!

28
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:21,791
I'm gonna call her Bandit Bia.

29
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:23,209
Girl, I'm like her.

30
00:01:23,209 --> 00:01:26,128
I don't have the guts to do that.

31
00:01:26,128 --> 00:01:28,297
No, Carol, don't say that.

32
00:01:28,297 --> 00:01:30,382
Titto, not like that.

33
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:33,260
Look the guy in the eye...

34
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,346
You don't look him straight in the eye,

35
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:36,597
but you come and say...

36
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:38,724
"Hey, give me your number."

37
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:40,267
That's what you do!

38
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:42,102
This is very good, guys. Help.

39
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,814
My nickname is gonna be Bia, I'm like her.

40
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:47,233
I saw it, I want it, I can do it.

41
00:01:47,233 --> 00:01:50,402
It was nice because she broke free.
She needed that,

42
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:52,530
she broke free.

43
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,406
She built her confidence.

44
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:55,991
"She broke free."

45
00:01:57,326 --> 00:02:00,120
She needed to get rid
of Luan's energy, baby.

46
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,081
Goodbye, Luan. Time to move on.

47
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:04,917
Guys, what about
that young guy? Renatinho?

48
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:07,670
He had sex with Anna the first day.

49
00:02:07,795 --> 00:02:08,921
Yummy.

50
00:02:08,921 --> 00:02:11,841
And he got there doing
what he had to do, right?

51
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:14,051
I think he was too eager.

52
00:02:14,051 --> 00:02:16,512
Are you ready? My chocolate milk is.

53
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,097
Should we hit play?

54
00:02:18,097 --> 00:02:19,098
Let's go!

55
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:21,183
Hit it, hit it hard.

56
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:54,300
WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS 2

57
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:05,769
Whoever has feelings, cries.

58
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:08,647
Whoever doesn't have them, doesn't cry.

59
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:11,150
It's not about being tough.

60
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,360
Nobody was trying to act tough.

61
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,447
I'm getting this off my chest
because of you.

62
00:03:16,447 --> 00:03:17,865
You don't know.

63
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:19,867
The reason I'm crying is you.

64
00:03:19,867 --> 00:03:21,744
Why? Tell me.

65
00:03:21,744 --> 00:03:23,412
Do you know what happened?

66
00:03:23,412 --> 00:03:25,372
Shut up!
You think I don't know?

67
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:28,459
I don't need to tell you
to shut up, you know?

68
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:30,794
- I'll never say...
- Murilo, shut up.

69
00:03:30,794 --> 00:03:33,005
..."Nath, shut up."

70
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,214
I'll never say that!

71
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,425
Because you wanna play the saint!

72
00:03:36,425 --> 00:03:38,594
I wanna play the saint?

73
00:03:38,594 --> 00:03:40,054
Like Luan says.

74
00:03:40,054 --> 00:03:42,848
Play the saint? Me, bro?

75
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:12,044
Here's what happened.

76
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,171
Renato told me, "The first chick

77
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:17,299
-"who caught my attention was Nath."
- To me too.

78
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:21,887
Then Murilo came and asked
what was going on, and I said, "Mu,

79
00:04:21,887 --> 00:04:25,099
"Renatinho wants
to hook up with Nathália."

80
00:04:25,224 --> 00:04:28,143
And he said, "I know. Would you do it?"

81
00:04:28,143 --> 00:04:30,813
I said, "I would. Tomorrow is a new day."

82
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:32,314
Was that the reason?

83
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:34,149
Then things got ugly.

84
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:36,568
Renato came to me and Bia and said,

85
00:04:36,568 --> 00:04:39,571
"The first chick I saw was Nath."

86
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:41,615
No, hey...

87
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,909
Would you hook up with him?

88
00:04:43,909 --> 00:04:45,035
Would you?

89
00:04:45,869 --> 00:04:47,830
Not today, but tomorrow...

90
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:49,331
That's it, buddy.

91
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:51,959
He didn't understand the situation.

92
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,132
Those girls play dumb.

93
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:01,969
Those girls play dumb, buddy.

94
00:05:03,637 --> 00:05:07,725
That's fucked up, bro. I'm starting
to understand this now, you know?

95
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:12,438
It was my first night out, I can't come
to a conclusion of something that...

96
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:15,357
You know?

97
00:05:15,482 --> 00:05:16,442
Soon you'll get it.

98
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,944
Yes, I know. Absolutely.

99
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:20,404
Give it time.

100
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:21,780
Give it time.

101
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:30,205
Just wake up.

102
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:33,709
Let's talk about what we
were gonna talk about yesterday.

103
00:05:34,209 --> 00:05:35,794
What do you wanna talk about?

104
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,755
You said you wanted to talk.

105
00:05:37,755 --> 00:05:40,424
No, you apologized, I said,

106
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:42,259
"We'll talk tomorrow."

107
00:05:44,678 --> 00:05:46,638
You're sorry for what?

108
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:49,767
For yesterday, you know?

109
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:52,686
I felt like doing whatever I wanted.

110
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:55,522
Just like us...

111
00:05:55,898 --> 00:05:58,525
If you wanted to hook up with anybody,

112
00:05:58,525 --> 00:06:01,570
like the guy you were talking to, yesterday,

113
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:05,491
that's no big deal for me, you know?

114
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,701
We talked about this.

115
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:11,246
You're not gonna spend
a lot of time here, obviously,

116
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:15,209
so maybe, it wouldn't bother me as much

117
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,211
if it weren't a girl from here.

118
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:19,088
Nath is a good friend.

119
00:06:19,088 --> 00:06:22,800
And what bothered me the most was...

120
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,177
I don't know...

121
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:28,263
but everything happened in front of me.

122
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:31,058
You were throwing yourself at Nathália...

123
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:33,644
helping her, and I don't know.

124
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:36,480
Obviously, that bothered me!

125
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:39,149
I didn't react badly,
I just kept to myself.

126
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:42,111
You know?
I just kept to myself.

127
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:45,823
But that bothered me because

128
00:06:45,823 --> 00:06:47,783
she's my friend,

129
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:50,285
and you were throwing yourself at her.

130
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:52,204
You were very worried, like...

131
00:06:52,204 --> 00:06:54,748
No, bro, like, that was not...

132
00:06:54,748 --> 00:06:58,168
because of this, you know?

133
00:06:58,418 --> 00:07:00,420
Bro, something, like...

134
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,133
I know, you were worried about her.

135
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:06,927
Anyway, I'll get up and put on my bikini,

136
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:10,222
or else I'll stay in bed
and sleep all day.

137
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:13,100
Yeah. So, we're good?

138
00:07:13,225 --> 00:07:15,269
One hundred percent good?

139
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:17,729
I swear.

140
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:21,108
You swear?

141
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:27,656
I'm good.

142
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:45,883
Andiamo.

143
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:48,051
We're in this together, dude.

144
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:52,014
You can count on me for these things.

145
00:07:52,014 --> 00:07:53,307
God bless you, bro.

146
00:07:53,307 --> 00:07:54,558
You too.

147
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:55,851
I need...

148
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:57,561
Say hello to...

149
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,062
Bye. Kisses.

150
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:01,023
If I forget anything...

151
00:08:01,023 --> 00:08:03,192
- give it to Renato.
- Thanks for coming.

152
00:08:21,376 --> 00:08:22,502
No problem.

153
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:27,549
Guys, I got an audio message.

154
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,593
- Wanna hear it?
- Sure.

155
00:08:29,843 --> 00:08:31,220
Girl...

156
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:33,805
Mu! I got an audio message, come here.

157
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,058
What's up, guys? How are you?

158
00:08:36,058 --> 00:08:38,810
Today, the boys are gonna work at the bar.

159
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:40,896
I heard Luan left,

160
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:44,524
and we're gonna reinforce the team
to help Ramon and Murilo.

161
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:48,320
That's it. I'm waiting for you here.
See you.

162
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,323
Come with us, bro.

163
00:08:51,323 --> 00:08:53,742
You've got nothing to do, go with them.

164
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:55,827
If I'm supposed to go and help...

165
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,418
Did you talk to Murilo?

166
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:07,714
It's because
I was bothered by something that happened.

167
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,591
When he hit on you?

168
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:13,595
When you said you'd hook up with Renato,
he said, like...

169
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:17,391
"I'd hook up with Anna big time."

170
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,935
- I don't want him drunk.
- You guys were drunk...

171
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:21,812
Using me to make mischief.

172
00:09:21,812 --> 00:09:23,605
I didn't say that about Renato.

173
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,275
Did Renato talk to you?

174
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:28,986
He did. I still think the same way,
I told him.

175
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:31,488
I don't care if he wants other girls.

176
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:32,614
Sure.

177
00:09:32,614 --> 00:09:35,575
Yesterday, I felt... Like, I told him,

178
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:36,576
I said, "Man,

179
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:39,538
"let's stay together,

180
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:42,833
"but if I feel like it,
hooking up with other people."

181
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,127
We're here to have fun.

182
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,879
He didn't come here to stay with me.

183
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:51,717
He left his house, he lives close to me,
to stay with me here.

184
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:54,136
Right, there's still Rio.

185
00:09:54,136 --> 00:09:57,639
I said, "We're here to have fun."

186
00:09:57,639 --> 00:10:00,142
If he had hooked up with 15 girls, fine.

187
00:10:00,142 --> 00:10:01,435
The problem was...

188
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:03,478
You're my friend, you know?

189
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:06,106
I said, "Man, I just wish
you had told me."

190
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,400
Still, "I don't know if she wants it."

191
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,652
But if she wants, she'll do it.

192
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:11,945
Got it?

193
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,156
I bet you'd be upset if Ramon

194
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:16,283
- hit on me.
- Sure, I told him that.

195
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,909
And I'll tell you later.

196
00:10:17,909 --> 00:10:21,580
I say, "Anna didn't hook up
because she didn't want to."

197
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:23,874
I thought you'd say, "Go, Nathália!"

198
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,918
I just wanted to be informed, you know?

199
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:30,297
It seemed, yesterday
he was here for Nathália.

200
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:33,175
Girl, he'd just fucked me.

201
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:38,305
She said,

202
00:10:38,764 --> 00:10:41,099
"Let's hook up, me and you,

203
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:44,394
"Renato wants to hook up with Anna,
let's hook up..."

204
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:46,396
And I told Anna,

205
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:47,939
"Since Tay wants Renato,

206
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:50,567
"let's hook up." Like this.

207
00:10:50,567 --> 00:10:51,610
Who said it?

208
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,986
Tay.

209
00:10:54,446 --> 00:10:57,324
That's what happened.
I didn't get it.

210
00:10:58,408 --> 00:11:00,285
Did I hit on you?

211
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:03,789
I came to you and said...

212
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:08,585
When I said this, I said it to your face.

213
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:09,795
You wanted Anna?

214
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:12,047
No, let me tell you. I said...

215
00:11:12,047 --> 00:11:13,632
That you wanted Anna?

216
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:15,467
Did you tell me that?

217
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,219
No, I didn't tell you...

218
00:11:17,219 --> 00:11:20,597
He said, "Didn't you tell me
you'd hook up with Renato?"

219
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,224
I was embarrassed.

220
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:24,393
You told her this.

221
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:25,769
Just like you, kid.

222
00:11:25,769 --> 00:11:27,979
I didn't want to hook up with Renato,

223
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,773
you were wasted...

224
00:11:29,773 --> 00:11:32,818
You were wasted
and you heard something, you know?

225
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:35,237
You couldn't interpret what I said.

226
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:37,364
You should've asked me,

227
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:39,157
"Did you really say that?"

228
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:40,951
I asked you!

229
00:11:40,951 --> 00:11:42,494
You didn't ask me!

230
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:43,620
You know?

231
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:45,622
It was about Nathália!

232
00:11:45,622 --> 00:11:47,416
You asked me...

233
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,167
You're whining.

234
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:51,670
It's not whining. You're a drunk,

235
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,589
totally clueless!

236
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:56,550
Clueless?

237
00:11:56,550 --> 00:12:00,929
You were jealous!

238
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:02,764
You imagined things!

239
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:05,267
Do me a favor? Go talk to a shrink!

240
00:12:05,267 --> 00:12:06,518
No...

241
00:12:06,518 --> 00:12:07,978
I'm not jealous...

242
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:10,522
- You need help, babe.
- Abusive!

243
00:12:10,522 --> 00:12:13,483
When was I abusive?

244
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:15,360
Oh, you weren't?

245
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,070
Only you heard that.

246
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,363
- Only me?
- Yes.

247
00:12:18,363 --> 00:12:19,573
Okay.

248
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:36,965
There's no me and you.

249
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:38,300
Just give me my cap.

250
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,968
Okay, here.

251
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:42,512
Here, take your little cap.

252
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:44,055
Your stuff...

253
00:12:44,055 --> 00:12:46,892
Let's pretend we don't know each other.

254
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:49,060
- Thank you.
- Fine?

255
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:51,146
Jeez, totally. I'm so grateful.

256
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:53,231
No, not grateful.

257
00:12:59,237 --> 00:13:01,072
Let's go, people! Let's work!

258
00:13:01,239 --> 00:13:03,325
I wanna work on a day like this.

259
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,712
The energy here is not so good.

260
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,089
Let's go to the beach after eating?

261
00:13:18,089 --> 00:13:20,342
Let's bathe in the sea to purify?

262
00:13:20,342 --> 00:13:22,219
That's all I need!

263
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:24,262
Let's go?

264
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,934
Talk to us.

265
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:31,811
I definitely want to.

266
00:13:36,107 --> 00:13:38,068
I'm gonna put this there.

267
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,698
Let's go, girls?

268
00:14:03,385 --> 00:14:06,263
Look at his style.

269
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:08,932
- Hey, boss?
- What's up, boys?

270
00:14:08,932 --> 00:14:10,308
Hey, bro.

271
00:14:10,308 --> 00:14:13,103
- I'm great. What about you?
- Are you cool?

272
00:14:13,562 --> 00:14:16,147
- Nice to meet you.
- New blood.

273
00:14:16,147 --> 00:14:20,527
Let me introduce you,
this is Renato, my friend from Rio.

274
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:23,446
- Cool.
- I brought him to help out.

275
00:14:23,446 --> 00:14:25,865
If you need someone to help out...

276
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,284
He's a little short...

277
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:29,452
but he knows how to
get things done!

278
00:14:29,452 --> 00:14:33,206
If you need someone, he's available.

279
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:34,749
It's up to you.

280
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:37,961
We'll settle the rate at the end.
You can start.

281
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,254
Great!

282
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:40,922
Welcome!

283
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:44,009
Ramon, Murilo, you know how the bar works,

284
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:46,886
you know people are waiting
to set up things.

285
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,431
So, let's put on the uniform!

286
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:51,933
Let's go!

287
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:58,398
Cool, it's being served.

288
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,234
What's up, man? Are you okay?

289
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,703
Let's test Renatão?

290
00:15:11,703 --> 00:15:14,414
You bring the order
of those ten people there.

291
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,958
- Okay?
- Cool.

292
00:15:17,167 --> 00:15:19,794
If you drop it, it'll cost you your pay.

293
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:22,172
Save the tray.

294
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:24,299
Don't fucking drop it.

295
00:15:24,299 --> 00:15:27,385
Watch your step. Go slowly, dude.

296
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,805
I'm gonna run. Show some respect.

297
00:15:30,805 --> 00:15:31,723
He'll fuck up.

298
00:15:31,723 --> 00:15:34,017
Where are you from? Paraná?

299
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,353
- I see. What about you?
- And you?

300
00:15:36,353 --> 00:15:38,480
I'm from Rio. I'm here on vacation.

301
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:40,815
Doing...

302
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,108
Vacation...

303
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:46,488
- He's serious.
- You're making fun of me.

304
00:15:46,488 --> 00:15:50,116
I'm working, and you're making fun
of my accent, man?

305
00:15:50,617 --> 00:15:52,619
I'll be back with your drinks.

306
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,288
Thank you!

307
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:59,167
What's the deal with those chicks?
Can I really hit on...

308
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,252
So...

309
00:16:02,545 --> 00:16:04,631
You can do whatever you want.

310
00:16:04,631 --> 00:16:06,091
You know?

311
00:16:07,509 --> 00:16:09,386
Don't let the manager see...

312
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,472
What's up, Rafa? Is everything okay?

313
00:16:14,015 --> 00:16:16,101
Give her some ice.

314
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,646
Rafaela, Murilo.

315
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:22,148
What's up, Rafa? How are you?

316
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,819
I've already seen you somewhere.

317
00:16:25,819 --> 00:16:28,113
I think I've seen you too.

318
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:32,909
Were you at... What's the name...
Where did we go yesterday, bro?

319
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,787
There, we were at Rooftop.

320
00:16:36,037 --> 00:16:38,248
Oh, Art's is cool too, it's downtown.

321
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:40,291
Tonight we're going to 300.

322
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,169
Drop by!

323
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:44,879
Come with us.

324
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:48,508
You're invited,
let's take her to 300 tonight.

325
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:51,177
- I've seen you somewhere.
- I said this too.

326
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:54,013
I'm new here, just me.

327
00:16:58,059 --> 00:16:59,060
At some party.

328
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,812
Yeah, absolutely.

329
00:17:01,855 --> 00:17:03,690
You know I know you.

330
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,775
Where do I know you from?

331
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:08,319
I think you know me from some beach.

332
00:17:09,988 --> 00:17:11,614
The north of the island.

333
00:17:11,823 --> 00:17:14,701
Daniela's Beach, Jurerê...

334
00:17:14,701 --> 00:17:16,494
Yeah.

335
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,330
Yes, Daniela's Beach.

336
00:17:19,956 --> 00:17:22,167
Maybe it was Daniela's Beach.

337
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:24,043
Yeah, I think so too.

338
00:17:26,212 --> 00:17:27,380
I was drunk!

339
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,090
I was a little too.

340
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,842
You don't remember either?

341
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:32,802
Oh, sure I remember.

342
00:17:33,261 --> 00:17:36,181
So, I'm not mistaken.

343
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:37,515
I kissed her.

344
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,517
I imagined... When you said,

345
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:41,770
"I know you." I got it.

346
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:11,132
I can't analyze the situation.

347
00:18:11,633 --> 00:18:13,426
I can't see it.

348
00:18:14,052 --> 00:18:16,012
I think they all have girlfriends.

349
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:19,390
I wanted those guys...

350
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:22,644
I know, there are more over there.

351
00:18:22,644 --> 00:18:25,438
Maybe we go for a walk,
exercise at the beach.

352
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:27,899
I think we could go for a walk.

353
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,859
Did you get a message, girl?

354
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:31,528
Yes.

355
00:18:31,528 --> 00:18:33,905
Girl, all good? How are you?

356
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:35,406
Let me tell you.

357
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:36,950
I've just reached Floripa.

358
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,828
Tell me where you are,
and I'm gonna meet you.

359
00:18:41,204 --> 00:18:43,998
One more member is coming!

360
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:46,167
Hi! I love it, right?

361
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:50,713
- We're at Praia...
- Novo Campeche.

362
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,258
Come meet us now.

363
00:18:53,258 --> 00:18:55,468
I'm gonna send you the location.

364
00:18:55,468 --> 00:18:56,678
Bye.

365
00:18:56,678 --> 00:18:58,429
Do you know how Bia met her?

366
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,307
Fighting with her on the floor, guys.

367
00:19:01,975 --> 00:19:04,394
Yeah, actually her ex-boyfriend, right?

368
00:19:04,394 --> 00:19:05,812
Is she a good person?

369
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,648
She's a great person. She's very positive!

370
00:19:09,065 --> 00:19:11,109
She's mature as fuck.

371
00:19:11,234 --> 00:19:14,195
She's a nutritionist and also a coach.

372
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:16,948
Imagine her body, right?

373
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:19,909
She's brunette, curly hair...

374
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,579
Can she come dressed?
If she wears a bikini,

375
00:19:22,579 --> 00:19:24,414
we're fucked.

376
00:19:24,414 --> 00:19:26,374
She's great, you'll love her!

377
00:19:26,374 --> 00:19:28,042
She's great!

378
00:19:28,042 --> 00:19:29,836
I think that's what we needed.

379
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,421
One more girl!

380
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:33,631
Yeah, the girls' team!

381
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:36,217
So it'll get even better.

382
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:37,677
Yes!

383
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:39,888
We're gonna have to kiss each other.

384
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:41,681
Right, Nathália?

385
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,349
I don't think she does that.

386
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:48,771
They're here. They're laying down.

387
00:19:49,272 --> 00:19:50,648
Oh, great.

388
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,571
You're kidding! She came...

389
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:59,157
Get out of here!

390
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:01,618
I can't believe you two came!

391
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:05,788
Girl! Damn.

392
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:11,044
Oh, my God!

393
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:15,673
Guys!

394
00:20:16,257 --> 00:20:17,926
Damn. Oh, my God!

395
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:19,594
My God!

396
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,221
Guys, Vic, Mikaella.

397
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:24,599
Nath, Tay,

398
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,976
- Anna.
- Nice to meet you.

399
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:28,770
Nice to meet you.

400
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,439
Damn, girl, I can't believe it's you!

401
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:32,732
God!

402
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:46,329
Well, guys. Are you okay, Rafa?

403
00:20:46,329 --> 00:20:50,166
Now the gig's over
you can talk about the sex shop...

404
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,794
Brother, now you can do anything.

405
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:54,921
Tell me. How are you?

406
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,632
How are you?

407
00:20:57,632 --> 00:21:00,385
Now, my job is over.

408
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:02,929
- Yes, I'm free.
- And you were paid?

409
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:04,389
Yes.

410
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:10,019
Yeah, be careful with what you say now.

411
00:21:10,019 --> 00:21:11,813
Renato selected...

412
00:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,773
That's it!

413
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,150
Oh, man...

414
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:18,152
The selection here is...

415
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:38,506
Are you gonna show up at 300 tonight?

416
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,550
Just because you invited me.

417
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:43,386
I'm gonna be there for sure.

418
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,847
- I hope so.
- And after?

419
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:47,223
After party!

420
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:48,891
So, parties never end?

421
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:50,476
You have no idea.

422
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:55,440
Let's go?

423
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,693
Don't do this!

424
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:00,695
Don't do this!

425
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:02,405
Don't do this!

426
00:22:02,405 --> 00:22:05,616
Let's go? You'll take her.

427
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:07,869
- You'll take her.
- No!

428
00:22:07,869 --> 00:22:09,746
No, I won't!

429
00:22:09,746 --> 00:22:12,665
I don't want it, bro.

430
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,333
- Ramon.
- I don't want to!

431
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,543
You'll take her.

432
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:17,587
You're here, you're doing it.

433
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:19,422
Call the girl.

434
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:22,216
I'm gonna be honest with her, look.

435
00:22:22,216 --> 00:22:23,551
I don't care.

436
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:38,483
I got here.

437
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:39,609
Luan...

438
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:44,155
He decided to become
the Latin American prince.

439
00:22:45,948 --> 00:22:48,451
You know how I am...

440
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,540
Let's get to the point.

441
00:22:55,333 --> 00:22:58,711
We were together,
everything was great, right?

442
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,422
With all of us, he became a prince.

443
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:05,384
He was respecting me.
I mean, as far as I know.

444
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:09,889
Luan's crazy.
He got jealous, it got crazy...

445
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:11,516
All the craziness...

446
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,184
The possessiveness...

447
00:23:13,476 --> 00:23:15,728
First, he got jealous of me with Tay.

448
00:23:15,853 --> 00:23:17,730
He thought I wanted...

449
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:21,901
One day, I was in a very bad space,
crying because of my relationship.

450
00:23:22,026 --> 00:23:23,820
Bia was looking after me, guys.

451
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:25,696
He thought we were hooking up.

452
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:27,657
I was cool, then I realized.

453
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:31,369
"I'm gonna get over there,
and he'll be with her,

454
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:33,579
"I'm gonna beat him up." Swear to God!

455
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,456
That's my girl, look.

456
00:23:35,456 --> 00:23:38,209
I was prepared to see him, you know?

457
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:41,295
I was gonna come over with him, you know?

458
00:23:41,295 --> 00:23:44,298
I'm very cool,
but don't mess with my friends.

459
00:23:44,298 --> 00:23:48,052
He'd already messed with my friends
before I arrived,

460
00:23:48,052 --> 00:23:49,929
I already hated him.

461
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:52,431
We got in the house,

462
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,476
and there was a fucking fight in the bus.

463
00:23:55,476 --> 00:23:58,229
Then he began to show who he really was.

464
00:23:58,229 --> 00:24:00,106
His mask was slipping.

465
00:24:00,398 --> 00:24:03,734
Then he began to get crazier and crazier.

466
00:24:03,734 --> 00:24:05,111
I love him very much.

467
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:06,863
I'm afraid when he's drunk.

468
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:10,408
I got in a really bad shape, you know?

469
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:14,078
Fuck, I'm not that, you know?

470
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:15,454
I'm more than that.

471
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:19,041
I lost track of who I am.
The whole time I was with him.

472
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,626
But it's what I told you,

473
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:22,253
you lose your essence,

474
00:24:22,253 --> 00:24:24,881
you try to fit somewhere you don't belong.

475
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:27,049
You're much better than this.

476
00:24:27,592 --> 00:24:30,303
Other things happened and I forgave,

477
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:33,764
I stayed with him
and I wasn't embarrassed.

478
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:37,977
It was an inner conflict, you know?

479
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:43,149
How are we going to...

480
00:24:43,149 --> 00:24:46,569
Take your stuff,
get ready and go to the house...

481
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,529
Then we warm up...

482
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:51,032
We dress up in the hotel and go there.

483
00:24:51,032 --> 00:24:52,950
- Deal.
- Take everything!

484
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:53,868
Everything!

485
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:55,786
We're absolute.

486
00:24:57,872 --> 00:25:00,249
One for all and all for one!

487
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,885
You said what I was gonna say, Bia.

488
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:13,387
I thought there was a sorority feeling.

489
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:15,973
A partnership between them, you know?

490
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:20,770
They're really very close friends.
Yeah, Nath, Tay, and Bia.

491
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,772
They'll add value to the group.

492
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:26,067
The girls got there,
they explained everything,

493
00:25:26,067 --> 00:25:27,276
nice briefing.

494
00:25:27,276 --> 00:25:29,570
Of course, we always do this.

495
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,988
I love it!

496
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:33,950
Bia needed to get things off her chest,

497
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:36,410
and admit she needed to be ashamed!

498
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,079
She needed to...

499
00:25:38,079 --> 00:25:39,956
She slapped herself!

500
00:25:39,956 --> 00:25:42,083
She's gonna get wild.

501
00:25:42,083 --> 00:25:43,876
She had never talked

502
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:47,838
about the perception she had about
her relationship.

503
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:49,465
Does she understand now?

504
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,926
I think she was able to understand

505
00:25:51,926 --> 00:25:54,136
and made things clear. It's...

506
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:55,179
That's good.

507
00:25:55,179 --> 00:25:57,306
All that she's been through.

508
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:01,352
It was very cool she said that
and understood that.

509
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:02,353
She's out.

510
00:26:02,353 --> 00:26:05,064
She was in a circle, now she's out.

511
00:26:05,064 --> 00:26:06,440
She's out.

512
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:09,902
I think it's really about understanding

513
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,570
the situation she was in

514
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:13,781
and being able to talk about it.

515
00:26:13,781 --> 00:26:17,076
Maybe she was embarrassed
to talk about that.

516
00:26:17,076 --> 00:26:20,246
Imagine that Anna

517
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:23,833
got there this vacation
and had to stand up for her friend.

518
00:26:23,833 --> 00:26:25,835
So, maybe she could...

519
00:26:25,835 --> 00:26:28,170
But it seems she's dealing with it well

520
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,007
and understands that it wasn't positive...

521
00:26:31,007 --> 00:26:33,509
She invited her friends, you know?

522
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:36,262
Her good friends,
so she's more comfortable.

523
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,806
Also, one of them is a coach,

524
00:26:38,806 --> 00:26:39,974
it helps.

525
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:53,321
Yeah.

526
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:56,157
Let's go!

527
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:01,078
We're here!

528
00:27:04,332 --> 00:27:05,541
Just come.

529
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:16,844
I'm here!

530
00:27:25,061 --> 00:27:27,563
Ramon, come to my office.

531
00:27:29,982 --> 00:27:31,359
Are you in the corner?

532
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:34,153
If those chicks come back without men,

533
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:37,406
we're gonna be fucked.

534
00:27:37,406 --> 00:27:38,449
Why?

535
00:27:38,991 --> 00:27:41,702
- They're gonna be pissed!
- Why?

536
00:27:41,827 --> 00:27:43,621
- I think so!
- At whom?

537
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:45,122
- At us!
- At me?

538
00:27:45,122 --> 00:27:47,166
No, not at you. You don't care.

539
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,627
He's afraid of the chicks.

540
00:27:49,627 --> 00:27:51,587
Oh, fuck you!

541
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:53,214
No, bro, I'm sure.

542
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:55,216
I'm sure!

543
00:27:55,216 --> 00:27:58,260
Take it or leave it.
Three words, let's go.

544
00:27:58,803 --> 00:28:00,679
I'm sure about this.

545
00:28:32,253 --> 00:28:34,004
Did you get my purse?

546
00:28:34,004 --> 00:28:35,881
- Yes.
- Thanks.

547
00:28:35,881 --> 00:28:38,551
There are women in the house.

548
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:39,718
Who?

549
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:42,471
I'm gonna freak out.

550
00:28:45,516 --> 00:28:47,810
- Are they here?
- No, it's a mirage.

551
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,895
What a good mirage!

552
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:52,606
There's no better mirage than that.

553
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:56,068
A mirage.

554
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,903
Are you done?

555
00:28:57,903 --> 00:28:59,864
We went to the beach, honey.

556
00:28:59,864 --> 00:29:01,240
Hi, I'm an intruder.

557
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,617
No way. Welcome.

558
00:29:04,452 --> 00:29:06,370
The kitchen is clean!

559
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,330
I'm still a little drunk.

560
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,082
Was it cool?

561
00:29:10,082 --> 00:29:11,834
Look, I worked...

562
00:29:11,834 --> 00:29:14,795
Did you work too?

563
00:29:15,045 --> 00:29:18,507
Then we drank, we stayed and I got drunk.

564
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,301
What did you do?

565
00:29:20,301 --> 00:29:22,261
- We went to the beach.
- Beach?

566
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:23,637
What are you eating?

567
00:29:25,055 --> 00:29:27,433
Who are they? I'm gonna kick your ass.

568
00:29:27,725 --> 00:29:29,018
Bro, look.

569
00:29:29,351 --> 00:29:30,478
Look...

570
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:32,688
Take it, let's take it.

571
00:29:33,939 --> 00:29:35,608
Did you see my belly?

572
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:36,942
I'll talk to you.

573
00:29:38,027 --> 00:29:39,278
What?

574
00:29:39,278 --> 00:29:40,446
You're making fun.

575
00:29:40,446 --> 00:29:41,822
That's all I needed.

576
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:51,790
Okay.

577
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:54,293
I know what you're doing.

578
00:29:54,627 --> 00:29:56,170
Let's go. Bye.

579
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,297
Bye, later.

580
00:30:14,772 --> 00:30:16,774
Girl!

581
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:26,116
Where are the guys?

582
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:29,286
How beautiful!

583
00:30:29,286 --> 00:30:31,121
What's up, guys?

584
00:30:35,918 --> 00:30:37,294
You're beautiful, guys!

585
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:40,381
Hey, girls!

586
00:30:40,381 --> 00:30:42,424
- Where are the girls?
- Upstairs.

587
00:30:43,092 --> 00:30:44,468
Look at the house!

588
00:30:44,468 --> 00:30:46,345
Jeez. What a house!

589
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:49,056
So, let's get the bag and take...

590
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:50,975
That's great, this bag.

591
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:52,893
Girl, wonderful!

592
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:08,242
Hey, the bus is here. Let's go!

593
00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:11,745
Let's see this bus speak.

594
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,402
Look!

595
00:31:53,495 --> 00:31:56,540
- What?
- This party!

596
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:58,417
Did you feel it shaking?

597
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:13,307
Look at that dark-haired guy. There!

598
00:32:16,185 --> 00:32:17,978
Look at them, just like us.

599
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:18,979
The boys.

600
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:21,190
They're talking
about us.

601
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,776
Girl, I'm sure.

602
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,695
It's like this, chew and swallow it.

603
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:29,365
You're gonna make out with Anna today.

604
00:32:29,365 --> 00:32:31,116
Those...

605
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:33,035
You're gonna have rough sex.

606
00:32:33,035 --> 00:32:36,038
Doesn't he just wanna have sex?

607
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:38,707
I'm not gonna have sex here, go away.

608
00:32:47,049 --> 00:32:50,928
In the bus, with the door open.

609
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:55,099
In the bus, door open,
you make the woman...

610
00:33:08,237 --> 00:33:09,822
You're beautiful,

611
00:33:09,822 --> 00:33:12,074
right?

612
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:15,035
- Cute.
- No!

613
00:33:29,383 --> 00:33:30,843
Good one!

614
00:33:32,177 --> 00:33:33,512
Let's take a walk.

615
00:33:33,721 --> 00:33:35,347
Let's go!

616
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:43,939
Let's go!

617
00:33:44,982 --> 00:33:46,442
Here...

618
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,695
- Bro...
- Enough!

619
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:52,823
Bro, things are going south,

620
00:33:52,823 --> 00:33:54,366
I'm not following shit.

621
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:58,036
Look.

622
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,289
It's all about debauchery.

623
00:34:01,790 --> 00:34:04,626
Bro, look, that's all I wanted.

624
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:06,962
- Bullshit.
- I swear.

625
00:34:06,962 --> 00:34:09,173
I swear!

626
00:34:09,173 --> 00:34:13,427
That's all I wanted.
Bro, I wanna be free here, you know?

627
00:34:13,427 --> 00:34:17,097
- You're free big time.
- Sure, bro!

628
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:20,768
She hooked up with that guy
and stayed with him,

629
00:34:20,768 --> 00:34:22,311
you know?

630
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:23,896
But are you cool, dude?

631
00:34:23,896 --> 00:34:26,648
- Sure, dude!
- Really? I want you to have fun.

632
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:29,401
Remember that thing I told you,

633
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:32,571
"Bro, don't fall for this", you know?

634
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:36,492
Enjoy the party, don't fall in love,
don't get emotional...

635
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:39,536
- Things are intense in here.
- I know.

636
00:34:39,536 --> 00:34:41,330
We need to have fun!

637
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:42,831
Not to become attached!

638
00:34:42,831 --> 00:34:45,125
I wanna have fun here!

639
00:34:45,125 --> 00:34:47,836
But they're restraining this.

640
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:49,755
I know.

641
00:34:50,506 --> 00:34:52,382
That's not gonna happen.

642
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:55,427
If I were in that situation...

643
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,471
I'd be there!

644
00:34:57,805 --> 00:34:59,223
Waiting for an invite.

645
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:03,685
That's what they have to understand, bro.

646
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:05,437
That's it!

647
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,983
Now let's have a smoke.

648
00:35:11,777 --> 00:35:13,278
This is Andrei.

649
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:14,863
Hello, how are you?

650
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,657
Nice to meet you, I'm fine.

651
00:35:16,657 --> 00:35:18,617
What's up? How are you?

652
00:35:21,078 --> 00:35:25,165
When are we gonna kiss?

653
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:29,878
Jeez, you're fast, right?
Honest. I like this way.

654
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:32,130
When they're not, I go away.

655
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,924
I don't know if I can do it.

656
00:35:33,924 --> 00:35:35,300
Of course you can!

657
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:37,386
You can do whatever you want!

658
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:51,775
Hold this! Let go because things are wild!

659
00:36:00,075 --> 00:36:01,326
Bebeto and Romário.

660
00:36:01,326 --> 00:36:02,786
Romário.

661
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:03,871
Bebeto.

662
00:36:03,871 --> 00:36:06,206
You're Bebeto.

663
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:07,374
I'm Neymar!

664
00:36:07,374 --> 00:36:09,001
Why am I the worst?

665
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,978
Let's go to the after party?

666
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:30,856
So, get up, you're my guest.

667
00:36:30,856 --> 00:36:32,649
No, let's go to the hotel.

668
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:34,026
What hotel?

669
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:35,360
We're in a mansion.

670
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:47,539
After, tete

671
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:49,750
Bro...

672
00:36:49,958 --> 00:36:51,501
Let's fucking go!

673
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:54,338
Again, touch it for good luck.

674
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,322
Go, Bia!

675
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:22,282
Fucking go! Let go.

676
00:37:22,282 --> 00:37:23,492
Oh, girl!

677
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:24,952
Wait!

678
00:37:24,952 --> 00:37:27,871
There!

679
00:37:27,871 --> 00:37:29,831
Go!

680
00:37:30,123 --> 00:37:31,500
One, two, three...

681
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:32,876
One for all

682
00:37:32,876 --> 00:37:35,379
And all for one!

683
00:37:38,131 --> 00:37:41,176
Oh, fuck!

684
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,386
Fuck!

685
00:37:42,386 --> 00:37:44,471
Guys!

686
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,598
Guys!

687
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:51,228
Look, tonight was the first night
we didn't fight!

688
00:37:53,939 --> 00:37:56,024
Cheers to our night!

689
00:37:56,024 --> 00:37:58,276
Fuck! Thank God.

690
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,403
Floripa!

691
00:37:59,403 --> 00:38:01,697
Amen! Hey, Nath, hold that!

692
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:04,116
Is there champagne here?

693
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:05,742
Yes.

694
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:08,912
We had no trouble, brother.

695
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:11,373
Everybody, fill up your glasses.

696
00:38:11,707 --> 00:38:12,916
Amen, go!

697
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:15,168
We had no trouble today.

698
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:16,503
Nobody fought!

699
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:19,381
Everybody's here and there'll be jacuzzi!

700
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:36,773
I'll show you around
our studio apartment. Come with me.

701
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:39,192
Go, everybody, get off the bus.

702
00:38:39,985 --> 00:38:42,029
Honey!

703
00:38:42,446 --> 00:38:43,613
Hey!

704
00:38:45,741 --> 00:38:47,534
Where are we going?

705
00:38:48,076 --> 00:38:50,829
Let's get to know the house, honey.

706
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:55,000
We're here. I missed this, family.

707
00:38:57,627 --> 00:39:00,380
I wanna know who's gonna cook.

708
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:35,499
I can't stop laughing, damn!

709
00:39:35,624 --> 00:39:37,542
I don't have much time.

710
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,795
Funny boy!

711
00:39:40,462 --> 00:39:42,255
Go, dickhead!

712
00:39:42,255 --> 00:39:45,050
Dickhead? Hey, are you jealous, right?

713
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,885
Of course, she sleeps with me.

714
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:50,013
No more, right? Enough.

715
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,932
Let's go!

716
00:39:51,932 --> 00:39:53,683
Bye, pretty boys.

717
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:55,268
Oh, for sure.

718
00:39:57,187 --> 00:39:59,439
He was sure he was gonna fuck me.

719
00:40:22,838 --> 00:40:25,882
Bro, I love that you came here, I'm happy!

720
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:29,261
Oh, fuck.

721
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:31,930
Bye, guys, God bless you.

722
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,515
I love you!

723
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:35,517
Kisses!

724
00:40:37,561 --> 00:40:38,687
Love you!

725
00:40:40,564 --> 00:40:42,941
Thank you, okay!

726
00:40:43,150 --> 00:40:44,776
Okay!

727
00:40:52,075 --> 00:40:56,163
Say hello to the girls laying down.
Tonight, we're going to Acqua.

728
00:40:56,496 --> 00:40:57,789
Do I meet you there?

729
00:40:57,998 --> 00:40:59,457
Okay.

730
00:40:59,875 --> 00:41:01,251
Yay.

731
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:05,922
So, I see you later.

732
00:41:06,089 --> 00:41:07,382
Okay. Bye.

733
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,144
Let's go to Acqua?

734
00:41:39,915 --> 00:41:42,125
Hey.

735
00:41:42,125 --> 00:41:44,711
It's rad.

736
00:41:44,711 --> 00:41:46,004
Look!

737
00:42:23,166 --> 00:42:25,585
Cheers, man!

738
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:28,797
It's just not centered, but it's good.

739
00:42:28,964 --> 00:42:31,466
- Man, I asked for that.
- Yeah.

740
00:42:31,466 --> 00:42:33,927
Don't complain or you get nothing.

741
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,062
Anna!

742
00:42:45,397 --> 00:42:47,190
She wants to grab you, look!

743
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:50,193
Hey, Renato, cheating on Anna, right?

744
00:42:50,193 --> 00:42:52,570
Let's stick her!

745
00:42:52,696 --> 00:42:54,656
Look...

746
00:42:54,656 --> 00:42:57,367
This one had...

747
00:42:57,367 --> 00:43:00,161
This one had her hair pulled...

748
00:43:00,161 --> 00:43:01,538
Things have changed.

749
00:43:01,538 --> 00:43:03,707
...this one's worried.

750
00:43:03,707 --> 00:43:04,916
Let me see your hair.

751
00:43:06,042 --> 00:43:07,877
You saw it, right?

752
00:43:07,877 --> 00:43:10,046
Renatinho kissing her in front of me?

753
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:12,424
You kissed other guys too.

754
00:43:12,424 --> 00:43:15,051
I open the relationship,
he closes it, honey.

755
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:18,138
Then he kissed her,
I stood behind him and said,

756
00:43:18,138 --> 00:43:20,265
"Open your eyes, I'm here, okay?"

757
00:43:21,057 --> 00:43:24,394
I told the girl, "Let me see
if you have hair I can pull."

758
00:43:25,312 --> 00:43:26,354
He's a good guy.

759
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:29,941
Very. Girl, have fun.

760
00:43:29,941 --> 00:43:32,235
No, girl, he's my pair! In the house.

761
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:34,696
My pair here...

762
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:37,157
- Oh, I got it. Me?
- No!

763
00:43:38,742 --> 00:43:39,868
But he's a good guy.

764
00:43:39,868 --> 00:43:42,037
Really good!

765
00:43:42,037 --> 00:43:44,080
He gives me the freedom

766
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,832
I want, you know?

767
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:47,292
Renan didn't.

768
00:43:47,834 --> 00:43:49,377
Treat me bad, I'll fall.

769
00:43:50,045 --> 00:43:52,839
That's why he doesn't care about me.

770
00:43:53,465 --> 00:43:56,593
What happened? Are you drunk?

771
00:43:57,302 --> 00:43:59,721
How are you? Nice to meet you.

772
00:43:59,721 --> 00:44:02,098
It's two kisses in Rio.

773
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:04,142
I got it.

774
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:06,811
Are the girls
in Porto Alegre hard to deal with?

775
00:44:07,187 --> 00:44:08,855
No, just you?

776
00:44:08,855 --> 00:44:10,607
You...

777
00:44:10,607 --> 00:44:14,486
I'm really hard to deal with.

778
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:19,699
I love girls that are hard
to deal with, you know?

779
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:21,076
Yeah!

780
00:44:21,076 --> 00:44:24,245
Even if the weather changes
She's the sun, summer

781
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:30,251
Look, girls!

782
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:33,129
I'll put my glasses on
because I can't believe this.

783
00:44:44,307 --> 00:44:47,102
I'm fucked up.

784
00:44:48,561 --> 00:44:50,480
I have to fill this up.

785
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,898
Hard to deal with?

786
00:44:51,898 --> 00:44:54,484
- She is.
- A lot, right?

787
00:44:54,484 --> 00:44:55,777
Because she... Lord.

788
00:44:55,777 --> 00:44:58,196
She was defending you, okay?

789
00:44:58,405 --> 00:45:00,365
Don't complain!

790
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:02,700
The girl had a bad look in her face,

791
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:04,077
she said,

792
00:45:04,077 --> 00:45:06,538
-"I'll go there!"
- Don't go.

793
00:45:06,538 --> 00:45:08,123
Don't go!

794
00:45:08,123 --> 00:45:11,918
- Option two.
- There's no option two.

795
00:45:14,170 --> 00:45:17,340
Tomorrow, I'm gonna...

796
00:45:18,174 --> 00:45:21,052
explore the whole house.

797
00:45:21,261 --> 00:45:23,805
Are you crazy?

798
00:45:26,099 --> 00:45:28,810
Your day was yesterday, I said nothing.

799
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:31,312
I was there, wasted, lots of pussies...

800
00:45:31,312 --> 00:45:34,107
You were wasted, that's why it was my day.

801
00:45:34,107 --> 00:45:35,191
Not my fault!

802
00:45:35,191 --> 00:45:37,986
Yesterday was your day, today is mine.

803
00:45:37,986 --> 00:45:40,488
Yesterday was your day.

804
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:42,532
We're gonna play with style.

805
00:45:46,035 --> 00:45:48,955
Guys! I got another box for us.

806
00:45:48,955 --> 00:45:50,790
Inside.

807
00:45:50,790 --> 00:45:53,209
Oh, that's bullshit! Really?

808
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:54,461
Let's go!

809
00:45:54,461 --> 00:45:56,087
Now? Oh, man!

810
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:58,798
You're gonna get around
with everybody inside.

811
00:46:26,701 --> 00:46:28,912
Holy shit!

812
00:46:28,912 --> 00:46:31,414
He said, "He looks like me."

813
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:32,790
He did?

814
00:47:05,365 --> 00:47:07,992
Hug your friend!

815
00:47:12,622 --> 00:47:15,792
Let's fucking go!

816
00:47:15,959 --> 00:47:18,503
Hey, Anna!

817
00:47:19,003 --> 00:47:20,797
Hey, Anna!

818
00:47:29,055 --> 00:47:31,558
Girl.

819
00:47:32,183 --> 00:47:33,560
You're crazy!

820
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,687
Be careful!

821
00:47:37,772 --> 00:47:40,441
I'm gonna fall, motherfucker.

822
00:48:15,351 --> 00:48:16,769
Girl.

823
00:48:17,854 --> 00:48:19,355
Jeez, I'm very sexy.

824
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:21,232
I could've gone like this.

825
00:48:21,232 --> 00:48:24,027
I didn't hook up today!

826
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:27,655
Look at her style. Filthy feet.

827
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:29,866
I'm gonna fall, motherfucker.

828
00:48:29,866 --> 00:48:31,993
Get up, then. Go. You're heavy.

829
00:48:31,993 --> 00:48:33,911
At the party... At the party...

830
00:48:34,245 --> 00:48:36,581
Let me go.

831
00:48:40,126 --> 00:48:43,004
At the party...

832
00:48:43,004 --> 00:48:46,299
I'm gonna puke, motherfuckers.

833
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:08,571
With the blondie?

834
00:49:08,571 --> 00:49:10,490
I sent her the sex code.

835
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:11,491
Yeah?

836
00:49:35,348 --> 00:49:37,892
I didn't feel anything about Murilo...

837
00:49:37,892 --> 00:49:39,936
I don't know if it's good or bad.

838
00:49:41,854 --> 00:49:43,272
I might not like him...

839
00:49:43,731 --> 00:49:45,191
You know?

840
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:54,325
The love's over, guys?

841
00:49:54,325 --> 00:49:58,121
She whispered,
"I think... I couldn't feel anything."

842
00:49:58,287 --> 00:49:59,247
My God!

843
00:49:59,247 --> 00:50:01,624
She's letting that feeling go away.

844
00:50:01,624 --> 00:50:03,543
It's good, but that "I think",

845
00:50:03,710 --> 00:50:05,211
is something very...

846
00:50:05,211 --> 00:50:08,005
She's not sure, right?

847
00:50:08,589 --> 00:50:11,968
Everything Murilo did in this episode,

848
00:50:11,968 --> 00:50:14,637
taking those girls home,

849
00:50:14,637 --> 00:50:16,889
he did it to affect Tay.

850
00:50:16,889 --> 00:50:18,808
If this is not working...

851
00:50:18,933 --> 00:50:21,769
If Tay doesn't care, he'll suffer a lot!

852
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:23,688
And Tay, I'll tell you,

853
00:50:23,688 --> 00:50:26,482
she's incredibly beautiful, if she wanted

854
00:50:26,482 --> 00:50:29,861
to hook up with anybody,
she would've kissed everyone.

855
00:50:29,861 --> 00:50:32,113
She said, "I'm gonna stay cool."

856
00:50:32,113 --> 00:50:35,116
And Murilo went wild.

857
00:50:35,116 --> 00:50:37,118
She said, "I'm gonna stay cool,

858
00:50:37,243 --> 00:50:39,120
"I'm in mourning,

859
00:50:39,120 --> 00:50:40,580
"but when it's over,

860
00:50:40,580 --> 00:50:43,833
-"things will get ugly."
- Maybe she didn't kiss anyone

861
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:47,253
so she would have a reason
to nail it in the end, like,

862
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:50,673
"Remember that summer
when you hooked up with everybody?"

863
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:51,632
That's it.

864
00:50:51,632 --> 00:50:53,718
Hit play!

865
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:55,094
ON THE NEXT EPISODE

866
00:50:55,261 --> 00:50:56,554
This affects me...

867
00:50:56,554 --> 00:50:59,015
Sometimes, I don't know what you want.

868
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:03,269
God bless, things get ugly.

869
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:08,065
Do you think this could be pregnancy?

870
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:11,694
Oh, my God!

871
00:51:11,903 --> 00:51:14,197
Oh, I don't wanna be here!

872
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:17,200
Take the fucking flamingo!

873
00:51:19,202 --> 00:51:21,704
Absolutely nobody. Me and my friends.

874
00:51:21,704 --> 00:51:24,373
Anna got upset with Renatinho...

875
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:26,334
No!

876
00:51:26,334 --> 00:51:28,628
"I wonder if it's pregnancy"?

877
00:51:28,628 --> 00:51:30,171
To whom?

878
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:32,965
I think Tay asked, didn't she?

879
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:35,384
So, if there's any pregnancy,

880
00:51:35,384 --> 00:51:37,512
there could be two possibilities.

881
00:51:37,804 --> 00:51:41,224
Murilo got Tay pregnant
or Luan got Bia pregnant.

882
00:51:41,224 --> 00:51:43,226
Or Renatinho got Anna pregnant.

883
00:51:43,226 --> 00:51:45,144
There wasn't enough time, man.

884
00:51:45,144 --> 00:51:47,104
I don't know how...

885
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:49,357
We watch this every week...

886
00:51:49,357 --> 00:51:50,566
No. Whatever...

887
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:53,152
If I'm tired of your face in three weeks,

888
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:58,282
- imagine pregnancy.
- I want Murilo to be a father!

889
00:51:58,491 --> 00:52:00,701
Easy, they're not a stable couple yet.

890
00:52:00,701 --> 00:52:03,788
Why would you wanna get pregnant,

891
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:07,834
- Having a child in that relationship?
- It's a strong relationship, man.

892
00:52:07,834 --> 00:52:11,879
Imagine getting pregnant on your vacation
in Wild and Free: Florianópolis.

893
00:52:11,879 --> 00:52:14,298
And what will the child's name be?
João!

894
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:16,592
They'll have to name him after João.

895
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:18,386
Blond João.

896
00:52:18,386 --> 00:52:20,429
Do a takeover.

897
00:52:20,429 --> 00:52:22,807
- I miss Blondie.
- I'm shocked.

898
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:25,518
I wonder why Anna was like that.

899
00:52:25,518 --> 00:52:26,644
Why?

900
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:29,272
Fear, this is called fear.

901
00:52:29,272 --> 00:52:32,108
Have you ever carried out
a pregnancy test?

902
00:52:32,108 --> 00:52:34,235
Baby, that's panic.

903
00:52:34,235 --> 00:52:37,572
Maybe somebody felt sick, puked,
Anna didn't wanna see it

904
00:52:37,572 --> 00:52:40,157
and they're considering a pregnancy.

905
00:52:40,157 --> 00:52:42,577
Bro, what about that floaty, man?

906
00:52:42,577 --> 00:52:43,494
What's that?

907
00:52:43,494 --> 00:52:45,329
I won't judge.

908
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:46,414
Would you do that?

909
00:52:46,414 --> 00:52:48,207
What's that?

910
00:52:48,207 --> 00:52:50,084
That floaty belongs...

911
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:53,421
- to that house pool, guys.
- No, that's smaller!

912
00:52:53,421 --> 00:52:55,882
That one is the size of a boat, bro.

913
00:52:55,882 --> 00:52:57,758
That one belongs to the pool.

914
00:52:57,758 --> 00:52:59,260
I don't get it.

915
00:52:59,260 --> 00:53:02,346
I think Carol would be
the chick, the car owner,

916
00:53:02,930 --> 00:53:05,308
with a lot of guys hanging in the floaty.

917
00:53:05,683 --> 00:53:07,977
Wouldn't she?

918
00:53:08,144 --> 00:53:08,978
Don't do this.

919
00:53:08,978 --> 00:53:12,315
I picture myself on the high seas
on that floaty.

920
00:53:12,315 --> 00:53:14,901
Drunk, on top of a flamingo.

921
00:53:14,901 --> 00:53:16,068
Probably!

922
00:53:16,068 --> 00:53:17,403
We'll wait one week?

923
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:19,572
Oh, in one week?

924
00:53:19,572 --> 00:53:21,240
Girl, I need a ride again.

925
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:24,744
I'm anxious about that pregnancy
and that floaty story.

926
00:53:24,744 --> 00:53:26,579
Are you okay, Lexa?

927
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:28,748
- Let's go!
- I'm anxious!

928
00:53:28,748 --> 00:53:30,833
I'll give Carol a massage.

929
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:32,752
That's yummy... Damn!
