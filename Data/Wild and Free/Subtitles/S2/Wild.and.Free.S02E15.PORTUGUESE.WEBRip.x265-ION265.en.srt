1
00:00:06,340 --> 00:00:08,509
- Oh, my God!
- The last episode.

2
00:00:08,509 --> 00:00:11,470
The last episode!

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:14,014
- Are you gonna cry?
- Yes, I am!

4
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,894
Oh, my God, the last day!

5
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:21,689
- What's up, guys?
- What's this?

6
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:23,065
What's this, Carol?

7
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:27,319
- It's the last day, I'm very sad!
- Guys, everybody is so beautiful!

8
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:32,742
How are you guys? I'm very sad.
It's the last episode of this season,

9
00:00:32,742 --> 00:00:36,454
and it's already so iconic,
but I'm sad it's gonna end.

10
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:42,543
- Me too. I'm already sad.
- What will you take in from this season?

11
00:00:42,793 --> 00:00:47,131
A lot of things...
That I have to be more patient...

12
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:51,010
Actually, they're all single,
not sure what I can learn from them.

13
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:55,389
- What about you, John?
- I learned to be detached and free.

14
00:00:55,389 --> 00:01:00,186
I think that's the motto of this season,
being free. And I'm gonna miss you guys!

15
00:01:01,604 --> 00:01:04,023
- Carol, my friend!
- We learned to listen

16
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:07,401
- to each other this season.
- It's because Renatinho

17
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:11,405
and Anna showed us it's about
being nice, about listening, right?

18
00:01:12,114 --> 00:01:15,743
- And always talk to the person.
- Exactly. Be honest.

19
00:01:15,743 --> 00:01:17,620
I learned...

20
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:22,291
I learned we can't fall for anybody
while on vacation in Floripa.

21
00:01:22,416 --> 00:01:26,420
Titto, what about you?
What will you miss besides me?

22
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:31,008
I'll miss the moments I had peace
and quiet, when you weren't by my side.

23
00:01:31,217 --> 00:01:34,345
Really? I'm gonna say
what you told me before the show.

24
00:01:34,345 --> 00:01:37,765
I think deep down,
you guys love each other very much.

25
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:42,061
We love each other so much
that we get lazy. Right?

26
00:01:42,686 --> 00:01:48,567
- I'm determined to watch the next episode!
- So be prepared to hit play!

27
00:01:48,859 --> 00:01:51,821
- Let me get the remote.
- Hit play with your heels.

28
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,532
- What?
- Hit play with your heels.

29
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:56,033
I think I had...

30
00:01:56,242 --> 00:01:58,202
Oh, bullshit.

31
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,900
WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS 2

32
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:42,288
God bless you.

33
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:46,500
- Kisses.
- Kisses!

34
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,919
Bye, girl.

35
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:52,798
- Don't cry, Romário.
- Romário doesn't cry anymore.

36
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:56,552
- Oh, I loved it, girl, it was great.
- Me too. I missed you a lot.

37
00:03:11,775 --> 00:03:15,279
Yeah, now you gotta see him again.

38
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:21,076
Jeez, Ramon, help me,
how am I gonna tell Luan?

39
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:26,457
Man, first you have to find out
how he's doing outside.

40
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:32,630
Okay, you can hate him all you want.
You didn't hate him before, did you?

41
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:35,549
- No, I don't hate him.
- There you go.

42
00:03:37,843 --> 00:03:43,140
The guy keeps fighting for no reason,
it sucks. You get tired.

43
00:03:43,349 --> 00:03:47,728
If someone is not with you
to join forces, he just gets in your way,

44
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,813
it's not worth it!

45
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:55,486
Let's go!

46
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:01,700
- Enjoy the last minutes.
- That's true.

47
00:04:02,117 --> 00:04:04,703
- The last hours.
- Yes!

48
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:17,174
What do you think about taking a walk,
just the two of us, today?

49
00:04:17,967 --> 00:04:20,844
- Sounds great.
- A little date.

50
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:25,432
- Yeah? Sounds really great.
- Deal?

51
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,267
It's a deal.

52
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:29,269
- Am I gonna drive?
- Yes.

53
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:30,562
Yay!

54
00:04:50,457 --> 00:04:54,628
- We weren't talking outside, right?
- No.

55
00:04:55,796 --> 00:04:59,633
So, I kind of didn't know
what was gonna happen.

56
00:05:00,551 --> 00:05:06,515
Oh, me neither, that's why I said
I didn't wanna see you when you said that.

57
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:11,061
- It would be better for us to meet here.
- I wanted to see you.

58
00:05:11,061 --> 00:05:15,399
I also wanted to, but I didn't think
that it was the best option, right?

59
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:19,403
As I said before,
sometimes, when we talked,

60
00:05:19,403 --> 00:05:22,489
we would end up here together,
and I didn't want that.

61
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:26,869
I didn't want to be on holiday
in a relationship.

62
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:31,999
After everything that happened
I wanted to set you free and be free.

63
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:35,002
- But do you understand the term "free"?
- Yes.

64
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:37,087
- It's not...
- You label things.

65
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:40,382
I wanted us to be free,
to see how it was gonna be here.

66
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:45,054
- And your test went totally wrong.
- What I thought would happen, happened.

67
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:47,556
So it worked!

68
00:05:47,556 --> 00:05:51,602
- Yes, nothing went well.
- Everything I asked the universe happened.

69
00:05:51,727 --> 00:05:55,647
I wouldn't test somebody I care about
like that. It's not authentic.

70
00:05:56,065 --> 00:05:57,399
It depends...

71
00:05:58,442 --> 00:06:00,778
You did what you felt like doing.

72
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:03,405
- Not literally. Some things...
- That's it!

73
00:06:03,405 --> 00:06:07,284
- ...other things, I didn't.
- That's what I wanted, you to be free.

74
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:09,453
Some things I did because I was angry.

75
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:13,540
Anyway, I made mistakes,
because I did that.

76
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:18,545
That's gonna last a little,
because I can't erase what I saw.

77
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:21,757
- It's not easy.
- It's inevitable, you know?

78
00:06:21,757 --> 00:06:25,260
- And that's it.
- It was great, I think we...

79
00:06:25,552 --> 00:06:28,013
talked and worked things out.

80
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:34,228
- We needed this, right?
- Yes, we were distant from each other.

81
00:06:34,853 --> 00:06:39,149
It all happened for us to mature.
And I matured a lot.

82
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:44,238
I experienced and felt somethings that...

83
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:48,450
If this was horrible for me,
it was much worse for you.

84
00:06:50,786 --> 00:06:54,832
But it's what they say,
that had to happen. It was meant to be.

85
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:59,962
You told me you were in Floripa before,
but you weren't.

86
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:03,674
No, it's wonderful.
Thanks for bringing me here.

87
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:07,803
- It's a walk, a peaceful walk.
- Discovering new places.

88
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:09,763
I've never come here either.

89
00:07:09,763 --> 00:07:12,307
I'd only heard about it.

90
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,688
Three hundred and sixty.

91
00:07:19,815 --> 00:07:23,902
Since you didn't say what we were gonna do
and we don't have bathing suits,

92
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,531
we'll have to get in the water naked.
But it's deserted.

93
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:29,783
- Will you forgive me?
- Okay.

94
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:33,829
I accept your apology,
but can't forgive you.

95
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:36,415
I understand.
Forgiveness takes time.

96
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,501
We've already talked about this.

97
00:07:41,545 --> 00:07:44,256
And thanks for being
such a wonderful woman.

98
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:48,635
Beautiful, hot and all.

99
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,143
- I love you.
- I love you.

100
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,819
Hey guys, what's up?

101
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,782
Today I'm gonna need
Murilo and Ramon at the bar.

102
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:55,827
Since Renatinho left,
bring one girl to help you, okay?

103
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:59,081
I'll see you there. Bye.

104
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:00,999
My egg!

105
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,836
It must be the new girl,
she's the one who worked less.

106
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:07,506
Anna? Yeah, it's her.

107
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,234
- We have to work today.
- What?

108
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,443
Yes!

109
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,903
Anna...

110
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:33,407
you're gonna work with us.

111
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:52,259
Bye, girls! Kisses!

112
00:09:52,509 --> 00:09:54,303
Bring home the bacon...

113
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:55,679
We gotta have a party!

114
00:09:55,846 --> 00:09:58,640
Somebody has to work, right?

115
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,601
- To pay all...
- It's not easy!

116
00:10:02,019 --> 00:10:03,061
Good evening!

117
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,620
You ordered another caipirinha?

118
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:25,959
Yeah, I owe you one, it's not personal.
I know you. How are you?

119
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,679
- It took a little while, but you got it.
- Thanks.

120
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:40,849
Now, I'm gonna drink it all.

121
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:44,269
And he won't see it.
You won't gossip about this, right?

122
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:10,504
Let's go!

123
00:11:13,173 --> 00:11:14,758
I'm drinking tonight.

124
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,438
Ramon!

125
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:30,315
He's there, drinking.

126
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,776
Ramon!

127
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:36,363
- To whom? Oh, I know.
- I don't know.

128
00:11:41,827 --> 00:11:43,412
That girl over there.

129
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:51,253
Ramon...

130
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:54,214
I saw you came back with half a drink...

131
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:58,468
I guess the client didn't like it.
Bring him a free drink. Okay?

132
00:11:58,468 --> 00:11:59,970
I'll do it now.

133
00:12:03,473 --> 00:12:05,976
There was no client,
I was the one drinking.

134
00:12:06,476 --> 00:12:08,019
I'm gonna drink it again.

135
00:12:18,905 --> 00:12:21,408
Keep the beat going

136
00:12:33,462 --> 00:12:35,505
Let's go, we have to work, fuck!

137
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:37,591
I was saying this right now.

138
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:40,969
Way to go! The intake of drinks is high.

139
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,305
It's high, great. Right, Anna?

140
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:49,478
Give me a vodka shot
before Ricardo sees it.

141
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,855
No, Ramon!

142
00:12:52,063 --> 00:12:55,066
Oh, Ramon, fuck you.
Seriously, that's fucked up!

143
00:12:55,525 --> 00:12:58,695
- Fuck you, man.
- Give me one more, Murilo.

144
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:02,157
Hit the bull's-eye.

145
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:20,550
A toast to this night, to us,
and to the end of a wonderful vacation.

146
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,511
I love you guys very much.

147
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:23,637
Wait!

148
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:27,974
One for all and all for one!

149
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:53,625
Look...

150
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:56,878
One Sex on the Beach
and a beer for that table.

151
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:59,673
- For those guys there.
- Sex...

152
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,678
- Just a Sex on the Beach...
- I gave you lots of tokens, you idiot.

153
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,808
One Sex on the Beach and a beer.

154
00:14:10,684 --> 00:14:13,812
- You go rest, bro. Get out of here.
- I wanna drink.

155
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:18,066
- You don't call the fucking shots!
- Get out!

156
00:14:29,661 --> 00:14:32,247
It's too calm here!

157
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,791
I'd rather be with the gang and have fun.

158
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:39,296
Can we convince him? Call Ricardo
and convince him to let us go.

159
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:42,591
- Not sure. I'll try.
- I think it's worth trying.

160
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:45,218
"No" is guaranteed, so let's try, right?

161
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:49,139
I'm gonna say... I'm gonna say, "Boss,

162
00:14:49,139 --> 00:14:53,393
"we're desperate for them, you know?
It's not the same thing."

163
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:57,939
Today is Friday. I'm gonna say,
"You're making a slave of my guy."

164
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:02,235
I'm gonna go downstairs
and try to convince him.

165
00:15:05,322 --> 00:15:08,283
I think this is gonna work. I hope so!

166
00:15:20,629 --> 00:15:23,506
- Stop laughing at them!
- Thanks. You're wonderful.

167
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:27,093
- Hello?
- Hi, boss, it's Taynara, how are you?

168
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:28,928
Hi, Taynara, I'm fine.

169
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:32,515
- Tell her I love her.
- Are you in a good mood?

170
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:37,937
- Why? What do you want from me?
- I need you to release them from duty.

171
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:42,484
You know the vacation's ending.
We are at Mess, a very cool place.

172
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:45,362
- But they're not done working.
- I am done.

173
00:15:45,487 --> 00:15:48,823
- Let Ramon stay. Ramon won't go!
- Fuck you!

174
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,035
I want to ask you to let them go.

175
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:55,997
There's gonna be an order...
Hey, excuse me, I'm on the phone.

176
00:15:55,997 --> 00:16:01,670
Can't you cut them some slack?
Reduce a bit their working hours?

177
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:06,633
Okay, since it's your last day,
everybody's free to have fun.

178
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:09,552
- Bye.
- Bye.

179
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:12,889
Holy shit!

180
00:16:13,014 --> 00:16:15,433
- Thanks, Ricardo!
- These guys like kissing.

181
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:17,769
Kiss, that's crazy. It's over, right?

182
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,688
It's the last one.

183
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:23,233
- You worked a lot, guys.
- Ramon did a great job.

184
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:25,360
- Great job, he was excited.
- Rookie.

185
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,988
Take it or leave it!
The party tonight is gonna be awesome.

186
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,825
- You're free to go.
- Forget it!

187
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:36,413
- You wanna make another caipirinha, Anna?
- Another caipirinha and one more beer!

188
00:16:36,579 --> 00:16:39,040
Thanks, little guy,
we're in this together!

189
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:42,836
No, I'm coming back, I don't wanna go.

190
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:52,971
- Let's go?
- Let's go, man!

191
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,932
- Please!
- It's over! I'm going home.

192
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:59,978
And let's party
Go, go, go, go, go

193
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:02,897
And let's party

194
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:19,289
Look, since we're calling the shots here,
let's buy one drink for the guys.

195
00:17:19,289 --> 00:17:22,000
I wanna see this!

196
00:17:22,292 --> 00:17:26,004
I wanna see this.
I'm analyzing the situation.

197
00:17:26,838 --> 00:17:30,800
We're rich,
we can buy the entire VIP box.

198
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,136
Go, Bia, it's your call.

199
00:17:36,181 --> 00:17:37,640
Hi, how are you?

200
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,310
- Nice to meet you.
- I know you.

201
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:41,936
From here, right?

202
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:44,063
- From Rooftop.
- Are you enjoying Floripa?

203
00:17:44,355 --> 00:17:46,357
A lot!

204
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:48,693
Hi! How are you?

205
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:52,322
- Nice to meet you, I'm Nath.
- Nice to meet you, I'm Rodrigo.

206
00:17:52,572 --> 00:17:54,908
- Rodrigo and Rodrigo?
- Yes!

207
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:56,993
How are you?

208
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:59,954
Would you like a drink from us?

209
00:17:59,954 --> 00:18:02,832
We're here to buy you a drink.

210
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,834
Oh, my God!

211
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:09,631
- Jesus Christ!
- A toast to you guys!

212
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:14,636
- Of course, we're absolute.
- Hello. Nice to meet you,

213
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,763
- I'm Rodrigo.
- I'm Taynara.

214
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:18,348
Nice to meet you, I'm Rodrigo.

215
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,225
I'm Taynara.

216
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:21,643
I'm André.

217
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:25,063
- It's not Rodrigo.
- I was expecting another Rodrigo.

218
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:39,744
Oh, my God, you're dancing forró music
with a funk song.

219
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,498
I can do all things
through He who strengthens me.

220
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:51,130
- Finally!
- This is Romário, whom I told you about.

221
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:53,216
- You did?
- Yes.

222
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:57,178
I missed you. The hot blondie
who arrives with Romário.

223
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,223
I missed you. I love you.

224
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:05,603
There are some pretty things here!

225
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:09,148
There are no hot guys,
but there's a lot of hot chicks.

226
00:19:27,542 --> 00:19:29,335
Guys! Let's go to the afterparty!

227
00:19:29,335 --> 00:19:34,048
Oh, that's delicious!

228
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:43,433
Who agrees that Ramon
will do the dishes until the end?

229
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:47,020
- I didn't work, just Murilo did.
- I doubt it, I trust Anna.

230
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:50,440
Yeah, but you said,
"I'm not gonna make the drinks."

231
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:56,988
- You nailed it, I know you did!
- Shut up. Stop being full of yourself.

232
00:19:57,155 --> 00:19:59,157
Stop it.

233
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,951
- Stop it!
- Do you get one for me?

234
00:20:02,118 --> 00:20:04,621
- Stop it!
- What are you saying?

235
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:07,665
Stop it, girl.

236
00:20:09,334 --> 00:20:14,088
- It's a fucking family!
- Fucking prick, impolite, rude...

237
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:18,968
stupid, ignorant. I'm not the only one
who thinks this way.

238
00:20:18,968 --> 00:20:21,596
But I'm a woman
and have the guts to say it.

239
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:24,223
I have the guts to say it.

240
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,684
No fighting!

241
00:20:30,438 --> 00:20:35,610
Everybody talks about you
behind your back, I have the guts...

242
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,236
I'm not talking about you.

243
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:41,950
- Who's everybody? Is it Tay?
- Everybody!

244
00:20:41,950 --> 00:20:45,411
I don't say he's a prick to me.
He is to you.

245
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,330
Not to me.

246
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,166
As a friend, Ramon is different.

247
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,962
The same way Murilo was a prick to me,
but he was never to you.

248
00:20:53,962 --> 00:20:57,423
- And she was a prick to me too.
- Exactly!

249
00:20:57,632 --> 00:21:00,468
You had to accept this and improve!

250
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:05,056
Ramon's a big prick to you,
never to me, he never did anything to me.

251
00:21:05,056 --> 00:21:09,477
I know! But you defended him
and didn't defend me.

252
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:13,856
You defended Murilo when he had sex
with that chick! You lent her a bikini!

253
00:21:14,023 --> 00:21:15,858
Are you happy?

254
00:21:15,984 --> 00:21:18,236
I did this, and you argued with me?

255
00:21:18,361 --> 00:21:20,822
- Drink it, sit down.
- Drink, my ass!

256
00:21:20,822 --> 00:21:23,282
- Drink my ass!
- Did I say your name?

257
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:26,077
- What's this?
- Fuck. Why are you hitting me?

258
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:28,705
Why are you throwing the drink?
When did I lie?

259
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:31,124
Damn, guys, fuck this. It's the last day!

260
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:33,835
- You're gonna fight on the last day?
- Relax.

261
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:36,212
I talked to him.

262
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:40,758
No, no, I'm aware, you know
I only said good things to you.

263
00:22:18,713 --> 00:22:20,173
Jerk!

264
00:22:23,092 --> 00:22:24,385
Right, girl?

265
00:22:24,802 --> 00:22:25,887
Let's go!

266
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:29,390
That's crazy, I only respect

267
00:22:30,558 --> 00:22:32,268
who deserves it,

268
00:22:34,562 --> 00:22:37,440
not who wants it. That's it!

269
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,818
I understand you,
I understand Nath, you know?

270
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:42,528
But, dude!

271
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:47,158
That was unnecessary, that's it!
Any kind of violence is unnecessary!

272
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,494
What a funny house, man.

273
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:51,996
I'm thinking here...

274
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:57,210
Everybody thinks the same way,
but I'm a proud woman and say it!

275
00:22:57,585 --> 00:23:03,424
You controlled yourself because
you're absolute. But I'm a troublemaker.

276
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:07,095
You know what's worse? She wanted
to put words in people's mouth,

277
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:09,222
and the others didn't agree with her.

278
00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:15,853
Then she got pissed. When she said
Tay's name, Tay didn't agree.

279
00:23:16,229 --> 00:23:19,023
Of course Tay wouldn't agree!

280
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:23,111
Then he started to play the victim,
"Oh, you're hitting me..."

281
00:23:23,277 --> 00:23:25,905
She's not better than anyone.
She always bullshits.

282
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:29,992
She acts like a child.
Women don't act this way!

283
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:35,164
Girl, if he wants to be a nitpicker,
I can be much more than him.

284
00:23:35,164 --> 00:23:37,208
I'm gonna be worse than him.

285
00:23:37,375 --> 00:23:42,046
Because he's trash, he's a prick.
Everybody has the same option.

286
00:23:42,505 --> 00:23:47,844
He taught me what I deserve and need.
And I don't need a guy like him.

287
00:23:48,177 --> 00:23:52,473
You've always been honest
about not having feelings for him.

288
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:55,768
You fought with Murilo?
"Jerk, you're disgusting..."

289
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:59,856
- We dated, just to be clear.
- It doesn't matter. I defended you!

290
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:02,483
I feel you don't do this for me.

291
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:07,071
That's because I like him, and you
used to tell me you didn't like Ramon.

292
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:09,407
And I think you don't defend me.

293
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:14,412
Because you never told me you have
feelings for the guy, so, to me...

294
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:18,624
My situation's the opposite.
You've always known we had something,

295
00:24:18,875 --> 00:24:21,878
- I never told you I didn't like Murilo.
- It doesn't matter.

296
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:26,799
- It's about respect. I respect my friends.
- I never said I didn't like Murilo.

297
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:29,927
I respect my friends,
but they have to be honest with me.

298
00:24:29,927 --> 00:24:31,179
That's boring!

299
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:34,807
You can't compare with me and Murilo
because we work things out.

300
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:37,727
- No, it's not about comparing...
- You never dated...

301
00:24:37,727 --> 00:24:41,230
- ...the point is, none of them...
- What's the point?

302
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:43,024
Me and you.

303
00:24:43,024 --> 00:24:47,195
Tell me, "You hurt me when you make
friends with the girls Ramon dates."

304
00:24:47,195 --> 00:24:50,781
Like Vanessa,
you were upset because of her!

305
00:24:50,948 --> 00:24:53,409
We agreed we were gonna stick together.

306
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:56,871
- Men are friends with men.
- Together, but not hypocrites.

307
00:24:56,871 --> 00:24:59,874
- Men defend men until the end.
- Not hypocrites.

308
00:24:59,874 --> 00:25:05,296
If you wanna take their side,
that's on you. Hypocrite, my ass.

309
00:25:05,296 --> 00:25:07,256
Girl, together, but not hypocrites.

310
00:25:07,465 --> 00:25:11,552
If everybody thinks the same way,
or don't have the guts to say it, I do.

311
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:16,807
- Wait, what is this opinion again?
- You generalize everybody.

312
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:19,560
- Bia, don't you think like me?
- I wanna...

313
00:25:19,685 --> 00:25:23,940
I wanna know
what you're thinking to say this.

314
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:28,778
Everything's funny as long
as it's happening to somebody else.

315
00:25:28,778 --> 00:25:34,200
If Murilo hooked up with somebody,
I said, "Go, hook up with somebody!"

316
00:25:34,367 --> 00:25:36,535
- Same thing.
- But I liked him.

317
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:40,039
It doesn't matter,
this happened on the first vacation.

318
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:43,125
I liked Ramon at the first party,
and what did you do?

319
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:47,129
"Look, Ramonzinho had sex with a girl.
Go, Ramonzinho!"

320
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:51,050
You don't even remember anything
and you remember this?

321
00:25:51,342 --> 00:25:53,094
I remember what I do!

322
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:56,347
- It's totally different.
- It's good!

323
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:58,641
Great!

324
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:01,477
I've already admitted being a phony.
So are you.

325
00:26:01,644 --> 00:26:05,982
- If I were, I wouldn't say it.
- Finally, right?

326
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:09,151
You hate that I'm friendly
with Ramon's girls

327
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:13,030
because you like him and won't admit it.
That's what it seems!

328
00:26:13,197 --> 00:26:16,200
- Let me finish! Wait for your turn!
- I don't like him!

329
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,247
Let me finish? I'd be hurt by Murilo
because I love him.

330
00:26:21,414 --> 00:26:26,502
So, it's different. You got here saying
you felt nothing for Ramon.

331
00:26:26,502 --> 00:26:31,299
So, I'll make friends with Vanessa...
because I think you won't get hurt.

332
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:36,178
I told Ramon a lot of times
he was a piece of shit to you.

333
00:26:36,178 --> 00:26:39,557
Did I say you weren't true?
I said you were honest.

334
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:41,767
I've never told you...

335
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:47,106
But when I start being true to Murilo,
don't complain.

336
00:26:47,106 --> 00:26:52,028
When I start to say,
"Mu, hook up with her, Mu!"

337
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:53,821
Don't complain!

338
00:26:53,821 --> 00:26:55,990
- Do I say that?
- It's the same.

339
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:59,201
"Jeez, buddy, that chick is real hot,
hook up with her."

340
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:12,131
What happened here was unexpected.
She was surprised too.

341
00:27:12,381 --> 00:27:18,220
I think she could've said a lot of things
in a better way, tomorrow she'll admit it.

342
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:21,057
That depends
on how she'll feel about this.

343
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:28,731
But here is different.
Everybody has problems.

344
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:32,985
She can stay with Ramon,
she's just told him he's a piece of shit.

345
00:27:38,491 --> 00:27:40,368
Hey, your Uber's here, buddy.

346
00:27:40,493 --> 00:27:43,621
Bia, he's leaving, say goodbye to him.

347
00:27:45,706 --> 00:27:48,334
- Bye, Rodrigo.
- Thanks, Rodrigo.

348
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:51,921
We're in this together. I'll walk you out.

349
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:54,799
Forget it, we're in Floripa together.

350
00:27:55,883 --> 00:27:59,095
I'm very sad to see
two friends get to this point.

351
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:02,014
Girl, Nath's really wasted.

352
00:28:02,223 --> 00:28:05,393
Yes! She's totally wasted!

353
00:28:05,393 --> 00:28:10,022
The girls were trying to open her eyes,
but then they got it all off their chests,

354
00:28:10,022 --> 00:28:13,192
stuff they might regret.
She called her a phony.

355
00:28:13,401 --> 00:28:16,487
"You never remember anything,
how do you remember that?"

356
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:20,074
But I think Tay
is being reasonable, you know?

357
00:28:20,074 --> 00:28:24,453
Nobody can give her some advice because...
She doesn't stop talking,

358
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:29,750
she never lets anybody talk,
she's never wrong. They can't help her!

359
00:28:29,959 --> 00:28:34,880
And I think it's bad when she demands
people to take her side, when she's wrong.

360
00:28:35,047 --> 00:28:38,759
It's not like this, a true friend
supports you in good and bad times!

361
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:41,011
Those who pat you are not friends!

362
00:28:41,137 --> 00:28:45,724
Your true friend will scold you and say,
"Hey, you're fucking wrong!"

363
00:28:45,850 --> 00:28:49,687
"When I start being true to Murilo."
It's all wrong.

364
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:52,148
Because you always have to be true!

365
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:53,774
- Always!
- That's it!

366
00:28:53,899 --> 00:28:57,486
Did you hear the example she gave?
"Go get the hot girl!"

367
00:28:57,486 --> 00:29:00,865
Then Tay asked, "What do you mean?
Do I do this with Ramon?"

368
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,910
Guys, I hold a grudge against her
since the very first episode.

369
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:08,456
Don't say this, she'll block you
on Twitter. Be careful.

370
00:29:08,456 --> 00:29:11,625
She's wrong, everybody agrees with this,

371
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:16,881
but I think we can't be judgmental
because I was like this,

372
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:21,677
I had this attitude, I didn't listen
to anybody... And we evolve, right?

373
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:25,347
I'm judging her attitude,
but I've already done that.

374
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:28,184
Yeah, we mature, I hope she sees it...

375
00:29:28,476 --> 00:29:34,190
My contract says "Judge".
I came here to judge. Nath is wrong!

376
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:37,109
She's wrong. You have to be honest...

377
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:40,154
All the time!

378
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:45,743
But, Carol, what do you think about
your dream couple, Murilo and Tay?

379
00:29:45,910 --> 00:29:49,163
Guys, I'm very happy, I am, man...

380
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:52,208
I'm very happy with that wonderful couple.

381
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:55,294
I rooted for them
since the very first episode.

382
00:29:55,669 --> 00:29:59,423
Girl, you're rooting for them
since the very first episode.

383
00:29:59,423 --> 00:30:04,303
It's true, she's been talking about them
from the beginning, she's really happy.

384
00:30:05,095 --> 00:30:08,766
- Fake gel nails applause.
- I wanna be at that wedding.

385
00:30:08,974 --> 00:30:12,269
She's ready for this, we know it, Carol.

386
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:16,857
What did you think about the naked swim?
Do you think they had good sex?

387
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:20,861
I think they did.
I want them to have a baby.

388
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:22,571
Damn!

389
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:26,992
- That pregnancy test is enough, please.
- She wants to be the godmother!

390
00:30:27,368 --> 00:30:29,828
- I'm kidding!
- I agree with Jerry!

391
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,665
Oh, my dream is to be an aunt.

392
00:30:32,665 --> 00:30:37,836
I found that walk very cute.
I found it cute. I think they refreshed.

393
00:30:38,003 --> 00:30:39,838
- They needed it.
- They did!

394
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:45,094
And that talk they had in the car, like,
"Let's talk about our vacation..."

395
00:30:45,302 --> 00:30:50,432
"What you thought it was right..."
And they ended up having sex in the water!

396
00:30:50,432 --> 00:30:56,397
And I liked Murilo's honesty, he said
he did what he did because he was angry.

397
00:30:56,397 --> 00:30:58,649
I talked about this.

398
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:03,862
I think they matured a lot, right?
A lot of situations made him...

399
00:31:03,862 --> 00:31:06,949
Made him improve a lot, right?

400
00:31:07,157 --> 00:31:10,202
- Both of them are mature...
- I love what you said!

401
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:14,039
I think there's no pride anymore.
I think it's over!

402
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:18,836
None of them have that pride or are afraid
of apologizing, I think they're fine.

403
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:22,548
They had to put an end to that.
Having no fear of apologizing.

404
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:26,677
I loved what you've said about maturing
because Bia wasn't mature, right?

405
00:31:26,677 --> 00:31:32,433
Bia said, "How am I gonna see Luan
after hooking up with five guys?"

406
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:37,479
- You can hook up with whoever you want.
- No, girl, I agree with her.

407
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:42,818
One thing is that vacation, and another
is the reality, the end of that vacation.

408
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:47,239
- But she's on vacation!
- Girl, she was in an abusive relationship.

409
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:53,287
They're gonna come back to their reality.
Back to work, to their families,

410
00:31:53,454 --> 00:31:58,751
and she's gonna have to talk about it.
They'll both have to sit and talk.

411
00:31:58,751 --> 00:32:04,798
- Because I think there must be an end.
- I wonder if Bia was so quiet, so...

412
00:32:05,132 --> 00:32:09,928
She was so quiet because of that?
Because she'll have to talk to Luan?

413
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:14,099
- Bia hasn't had sex in two episodes.
- Girl, she took a guy home now.

414
00:32:14,266 --> 00:32:18,228
Girl, one thing is taking,
I wanna see them have sex!

415
00:32:18,228 --> 00:32:19,772
What, Pabllo?

416
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,358
Nothing, I wanna see people kissing.

417
00:32:22,358 --> 00:32:27,821
I think she showed everybody
that being wild and free in Florianópolis

418
00:32:27,821 --> 00:32:32,409
is not just about hooking up, it's about
having fun with your friends too!

419
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:36,747
Shut up, girl!
If you were free in Floripa, you'd be...

420
00:32:36,872 --> 00:32:41,168
Me? I would suck a lot.
Am I a whore? I'm a whore.

421
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:44,588
Get a clue! Let's hit play!

422
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:14,118
Girls, can I talk to you?
Outside, with Murilo, Bi and Tay.

423
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:31,427
I wanted to share with you something
I thought. Earlier, I woke up,

424
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:37,349
went to the lake, I thought about life,
everything I experienced on this vacation.

425
00:33:37,766 --> 00:33:41,520
About the history, I guess each one of you
has a history here,

426
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:46,066
wrote history like you do in life,
the way you think it's right.

427
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:51,280
I thought about my mistakes
and successes, about what I think.

428
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:57,327
I was true to myself, everything
we enjoyed, the fights, the drinks...

429
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:04,042
- It was crazy!
- And we enjoyed this

430
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:05,919
like everyone would like to.

431
00:34:06,378 --> 00:34:12,134
There were people fighting, getting along,
saying "I love you", making peace.

432
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:15,220
We've already enjoyed
almost all the parties.

433
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:18,432
- Thank God. Amen, brother.
- Thank God.

434
00:34:18,432 --> 00:34:22,144
But there's one party
we haven't enjoyed yet,

435
00:34:22,311 --> 00:34:26,607
and I wanted to take you there,
which is the unknown,

436
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:28,650
almost normal,

437
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:30,819
fucking P12!

438
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:37,493
Let's get wild, let's get wild!

439
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:40,496
Tonight we're going to P12!

440
00:34:40,871 --> 00:34:43,332
We're gonna bring the fucking house down.

441
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:45,793
The way only we know how to do it.

442
00:34:46,335 --> 00:34:48,754
- Now?
- We're gonna be carried out of there.

443
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:52,925
- Can we drink?
- Order the fucking booze!

444
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:55,135
I thought we were gonna relax today.

445
00:34:55,135 --> 00:34:59,932
One for all, and all for one!
One for all, and all for one!

446
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:04,478
TODAY I WILL ONLY COME BACK TOMORROW

447
00:35:09,358 --> 00:35:12,194
What's up, Murilo? P12 awaits me.

448
00:35:12,945 --> 00:35:15,781
Hey, tonight is gonna be epic. Fuck!

449
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:17,741
- We'll leave our mark.
- Fuck!

450
00:35:17,741 --> 00:35:22,538
Let's get in the bus with the right foot
because tonight is our last night here.

451
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:24,581
Night and day.

452
00:35:24,581 --> 00:35:26,500
Let's go!

453
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,837
Thanks, Floripa!

454
00:35:29,962 --> 00:35:31,046
Go, Ronaldo.

455
00:35:50,858 --> 00:35:54,903
One for all, and all for one. Yay!

456
00:36:23,974 --> 00:36:26,602
Look at Grijó, fuck! You son of a bitch!

457
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:37,946
Debauchery! Let's get wild!

458
00:36:40,115 --> 00:36:43,410
Debauchery! Let's get wild!

459
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:46,079
Debauchery! Let's get wild!

460
00:36:55,881 --> 00:36:57,758
It's fucking Floripa!

461
00:36:58,592 --> 00:37:00,552
Forget about me? Fuck!

462
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:16,109
"My boyfriend's here,
my boyfriend's here."

463
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:17,945
Who were your new friends?

464
00:37:23,784 --> 00:37:26,745
- You fucked up. By the look on your face!
- No.

465
00:37:27,496 --> 00:37:28,497
Really?

466
00:37:53,188 --> 00:37:55,148
MAGIC ISLAND

467
00:37:59,653 --> 00:38:01,571
That's how I like it.

468
00:38:02,572 --> 00:38:05,534
I'll allow him. Do it, kiss more.

469
00:38:11,415 --> 00:38:13,417
I missed you.

470
00:38:13,709 --> 00:38:15,085
Oh, flamingo!

471
00:38:16,837 --> 00:38:21,466
Flamingo tonight? Let's do it tonight.
Let's go see the flamingo tonight.

472
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:25,595
- Easy, the night's just begun.
- Yeah, but, look...

473
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:28,432
I promised him.

474
00:38:31,810 --> 00:38:33,812
Excuse me, Renatinho.

475
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:36,648
Give a triple kiss, you three.

476
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,902
Fuck! We're in this together.

477
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:43,280
Fuck!

478
00:38:43,405 --> 00:38:45,991
Fuck!

479
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:55,333
Couple!

480
00:38:55,542 --> 00:38:57,419
Couple!

481
00:39:40,295 --> 00:39:45,300
Good evening, guys! I wanna see everybody
full of energy, partying a lot.

482
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,761
I present you, Kevinho!

483
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:53,767
Take a ride and I'll introduce you
The best funk party in Rio de Janeiro

484
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:59,898
You know the Complexo da Penha
Is a real whorehouse

485
00:40:00,065 --> 00:40:06,029
Let's go to the cage, everything's fine

486
00:40:06,321 --> 00:40:11,993
A thin mustache and a hair cut
She looked at me, I looked at her and said

487
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,581
Come with Kevin and Chris
Sit, sit, sit, sit sit, sit

488
00:40:16,581 --> 00:40:18,667
What did I say? Jump, come on!

489
00:40:18,792 --> 00:40:24,172
Sit, sit sit
Sit sit, sit, oh, damn

490
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:30,053
Sit, sit sit,
Sit sit, sit, oh, damn

491
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,389
Put your hands up!

492
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:39,855
Now it's all mine
Your heart doesn't make lub-dub

493
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:46,111
Now it just beats like a butt
Your heart doesn't make lub-dub

494
00:40:47,028 --> 00:40:49,990
Now it just beats like a butt
Lub-dub, lub-dub, lub-dub

495
00:40:53,034 --> 00:40:56,413
Now it just beats like a butt
Lub-dub, lub-dub, lub-dub

496
00:40:56,413 --> 00:41:00,750
Please, ladies and gentlemen.
Put your hands in the air, everybody!

497
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:06,798
Now it just beats like a butt
Your heart doesn't make lub-dub

498
00:41:07,549 --> 00:41:13,513
Now it just beats like a butt
Your heart doesn't make lub-dub

499
00:41:14,556 --> 00:41:20,520
Now it just beats like a butt
Lub-dub, lub-dub, lub-dub

500
00:41:21,271 --> 00:41:26,902
Now it just beats like a butt
Lub-dub, lub-dub, lub-dub

501
00:41:28,278 --> 00:41:30,697
Now it just beats like a butt

502
00:41:31,907 --> 00:41:33,783
- Kiss me!
- Do you believe it?

503
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:36,161
I believe it, what about you?

504
00:41:36,161 --> 00:41:38,246
We believe it!

505
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:42,667
Give it up for Kevinho
who enjoyed, Floripa family!

506
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:59,309
Debauchery! Let's get wild!

507
00:42:09,778 --> 00:42:12,239
Girl, I can't take this.

508
00:42:47,190 --> 00:42:50,026
It's because of the booze.

509
00:43:14,259 --> 00:43:18,263
We're in Floripa!

510
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:23,184
She wants to date
I know what's gonna happen

511
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:26,730
Maybe our kiss is a match
Maybe I get the chills

512
00:43:26,855 --> 00:43:30,442
There's nobody home
I'm gonna turn the stereo on so

513
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:36,114
She can dance
She's gonna look at me

514
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:41,703
She's gonna tease me, all horny

515
00:43:42,203 --> 00:43:47,459
Looks like a mirage, it's a dirty thing
This chick is gonna live on my mattress

516
00:43:47,751 --> 00:43:53,715
This is what life is all about
Making love every day

517
00:43:54,591 --> 00:43:58,803
Waking up naked with you by my side

518
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,556
Let's go! Tonight there's an after!

519
00:44:01,556 --> 00:44:03,683
Fuck!

520
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:08,188
Let's go!

521
00:45:04,244 --> 00:45:06,913
Oh, fuck, it's the last afterparty!

522
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:08,540
I'm back!

523
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:12,710
This is gonna blow
I'm back!

524
00:45:27,851 --> 00:45:31,312
- You missed me, right?
- It's the last afterparty!

525
00:45:50,707 --> 00:45:52,125
Jump, Amanda.

526
00:46:31,372 --> 00:46:33,666
WHERE'S THE AFTERPARTY?
#itsfriday!

527
00:46:34,042 --> 00:46:37,420
Girl, you saw the awesome party?

528
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,465
- The afterparty was the best.
- I'm shocked!

529
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:45,762
- The first really good afterparty!
- There were naked people in the pool...

530
00:46:45,762 --> 00:46:49,432
- It was like Carnival!
- It was a micareta!

531
00:46:49,641 --> 00:46:54,145
- Everybody did whatever they wanted.
- I wanna see what happened after...

532
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:58,816
Man, seriously, I wish
I was at that afterparty.

533
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:03,279
I wish I was at everything, at the house,
at the party, at the afterparty...

534
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:05,907
No, the party was...
Guys, Kevinho? Imagine!

535
00:47:06,074 --> 00:47:11,204
But I felt a really good vibe
at that party at P12, right?

536
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:14,707
- Looks like everybody let off steam!
- Exactly!

537
00:47:14,874 --> 00:47:19,837
A New Year's Eve. It was fucking awesome.
Yeah, refreshed energy.

538
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:25,593
If they weren't cool, there was gonna be
the greatest fight of the year!

539
00:47:25,885 --> 00:47:27,554
It was gonna be war!

540
00:47:27,554 --> 00:47:32,392
Girl, don't you think a lot of people
had good sex at that afterparty?

541
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:36,646
We're gonna see them waking up now,
where they slept. I wanna see it.

542
00:47:36,813 --> 00:47:39,566
- I wanna see that too, the next day!
- Hit play!

543
00:47:51,452 --> 00:47:54,539
Guys, it's coming to an end,

544
00:47:54,706 --> 00:47:56,833
but I need help with one thing.

545
00:47:57,292 --> 00:48:00,336
Where's the next one gonna be?

546
00:48:00,461 --> 00:48:02,255
Oh, bro, I can't believe this!

547
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:09,220
One for all and all for one!
One for all and all for one!

548
00:48:16,352 --> 00:48:19,397
I wonder if there's not gonna be
season three. Carol?

549
00:48:19,564 --> 00:48:22,025
I hope so, I hope very much there is, man.

550
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:24,110
I hope you understand.

551
00:48:24,277 --> 00:48:25,570
That my love...

552
00:48:25,737 --> 00:48:27,864
Whore's love

553
00:48:27,864 --> 00:48:32,452
I'm very nervous? It's been two summers.
I'm already spoiled.

554
00:48:32,702 --> 00:48:35,788
You broke the couch
and now you're gonna leave.

555
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:38,833
- No, he really broke it.
- I really got pissed.

556
00:48:39,500 --> 00:48:41,836
Guys, thank you. There's that saying,

557
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:44,631
"If you stay, take my dick,
if you leave, my father's."

558
00:48:44,756 --> 00:48:49,677
I'm gonna take an Amazon's glass home.

559
00:48:49,677 --> 00:48:51,137
Oh, I'm okay.

560
00:48:51,679 --> 00:48:55,725
- Amazon, invite me to season three!
- I hope to see you guys next time.

561
00:48:55,725 --> 00:49:00,938
Bro, the guy managed to break
the leg of the couch.

562
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:04,233
Oh, my God, I'm gonna miss this a lot.

563
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:06,486
I think there's gonna be season three.

564
00:49:06,486 --> 00:49:10,448
I hope to God, and we'll be there, sister.

565
00:49:10,448 --> 00:49:14,619
I wanna see if they swap everybody
and pick people like us.

566
00:50:20,643 --> 00:50:22,645
