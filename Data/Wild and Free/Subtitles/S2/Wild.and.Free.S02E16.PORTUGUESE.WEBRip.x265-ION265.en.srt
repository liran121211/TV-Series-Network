WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS 2
THE REVIEW

2
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:11,011
- The last episode.
- No, the last episode!

3
00:00:11,470 --> 00:00:13,597
- Are you gonna cry?
- Yes, I am.

4
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:16,058
I'm gonna cry!

5
00:00:16,308 --> 00:00:19,437
Oh, my God,
the last day!

6
00:00:19,687 --> 00:00:21,522
What's up, guys?

7
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:23,023
What's this, Carol?

8
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:24,775
It's the last day. I'm very sad!

9
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,902
Guys, everybody is so beautiful!

10
00:00:27,611 --> 00:00:32,825
So, how are you guys? I'm very sad, guys.
It's the last episode of this season,

11
00:00:32,992 --> 00:00:36,704
and it's so iconic.
But I'm sad it's gonna end.

12
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:38,497
Me too, I'm already sad. Really.

13
00:00:38,497 --> 00:00:43,669
What are you gonna take in
from this season? Which good things?

14
00:00:43,794 --> 00:00:46,964
A lot of things,
that I have to be more patient...

15
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:50,760
People are single,
so what do I have to learn!

16
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,719
What about you?

17
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:54,889
I learned that I need
to be detached and free.

18
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:59,935
This season's motto is to be free.
I'll miss you guys!

19
00:01:01,395 --> 00:01:02,354
Carol, my friend!

20
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:05,316
I think we learned
to listen more to each other.

21
00:01:05,775 --> 00:01:11,405
- At least I learned to listen more.
- That's because of Renatinho and Anna!

22
00:01:11,697 --> 00:01:14,033
- I've learned...
- Always talk to the person.

23
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:15,910
To be honest with other people!

24
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:17,578
I love being honest.

25
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:23,918
I love it! I think, in a relationship,
when you're honest...

26
00:01:24,293 --> 00:01:27,463
Tell me where you got
the inspiration for that look, Pabllo.

27
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:30,758
This one I got from Pride...

28
00:01:30,966 --> 00:01:32,885
You and Lexa are matching!

29
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:34,637
Yes, the pigtails

30
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:37,807
- and the necklace.
- Carol's wearing a single ponytail.

31
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:43,771
But Carol is a mix of sorceress
and "I sucked a golden bar." What's that?

32
00:01:43,896 --> 00:01:44,772
Anyway...

33
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:51,153
I learned we can't fall for anybody

34
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:55,825
while on vacation in Floripa, you know.
That's it.

35
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,871
She's fancy,
but she's drinking chocolate milk!

36
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,873
- Titto, what about you?
- What?

37
00:02:02,873 --> 00:02:04,333
What will you miss?

38
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:09,129
I'm gonna miss the moment I had peace,
the moments you weren't by my side.

39
00:02:09,338 --> 00:02:11,966
I'll tell what you told me
before the show.

40
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:15,678
I think deep down,
you love each other very much.

41
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:19,098
- You know?
- Our love's so intense, it makes no sense.

42
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:20,266
Right?

43
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:23,811
What were the most interesting gossips
in this season?

44
00:02:23,936 --> 00:02:25,229
There were many!

45
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:29,233
No, first, the bad breath
when they woke up and kissed.

46
00:02:29,483 --> 00:02:31,735
Who wakes up and kisses in the mouth?

47
00:02:31,861 --> 00:02:34,405
- And talks so close?
- Man, I've done that.

48
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:39,743
When I wake up, it looks like I sucked
a dog's ass. I want to brush my teeth.

49
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:45,165
I think that hit with the elbow
to Murilo's face proved the thing is real.

50
00:02:45,457 --> 00:02:47,126
I won't let you go.

51
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:48,669
You can hit me.

52
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:53,299
We learned and also saw,
I think people from home saw that too

53
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:56,802
and watched Luan's situation,
which set an...

54
00:02:56,969 --> 00:03:00,848
Actually, we really could see
the whole picture.

55
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:04,643
- And we can't forget the ménage...
- The ménage was epic!

56
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:07,062
- Renatinho...
- Trigger warning?

57
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:08,063
Renatinho...

58
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:12,568
Anna was a new member
at the house and represented.

59
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:17,448
This is the sex room!

60
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,369
I wanna watch the next episode.
What about you?

61
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:25,080
Hit play, please. Do it!

62
00:03:25,623 --> 00:03:27,458
What? Let me get the remote here.

63
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:29,084
Turn it on with your heels.

64
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,003
Oh, bullshit.

65
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:48,270
I'm a little happy he left.
He caused all that situation...

66
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:49,730
Me too!

67
00:03:50,105 --> 00:03:52,608
- ...in the last episode, so...
- Bye, Ítalo!

68
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:55,152
Ramon, help me, how am I gonna tell Luan?

69
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:56,904
Girl, what?

70
00:03:57,154 --> 00:03:58,155
"I kissed guys."

71
00:03:58,155 --> 00:04:00,199
She doesn't have to explain anything!

72
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:02,284
She wants to get back together.

73
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,994
She intends to stay with him.

74
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:06,330
- She's thinking about Luan.
- Wait!

75
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:08,624
That happened on this vacation,

76
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:12,544
but the vacation is at an end,
and she'll return to her reality

77
00:04:12,836 --> 00:04:13,796
and there's Luan.

78
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,506
He just left the house...

79
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:18,300
but he's still in her life.
They must talk.

80
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:21,887
She made clear that, after the show,
Luan's her reality, you know?

81
00:04:22,012 --> 00:04:25,808
No, she knows that at some point
she'll have to work things out.

82
00:04:25,808 --> 00:04:29,937
The guy aborted mission vacation,
now she'll meet him and say, "What now?"

83
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:33,649
But when he left, he said,
"Have fun." Didn't he?

84
00:04:33,899 --> 00:04:35,359
He did, he said...

85
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,404
- Lexa's right.
- Even a parrot can say something!

86
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:39,697
For God's sake.

87
00:04:40,072 --> 00:04:42,157
People say things they can't handle.

88
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,410
If I can't handle it, I don't say it.

89
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,621
No, but I think they need
to have this conversation.

90
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:51,125
- Absolutely. They need this.
- But not in this mood of fear.

91
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:56,630
Imagine this, everything ended,
they're at home, having popcorn,

92
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,174
he watches her kissing two guys...

93
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:03,470
- But, guys!
- I'm not saying that's wrong or right...

94
00:05:03,679 --> 00:05:05,305
He's really jealous, imagine...

95
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,850
But why did he leave the house?

96
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,685
I hope he's seeing a shrink.

97
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,729
- Yes.
- Me too.

98
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,915
- We weren't talking outside, right?
- No.

99
00:05:32,082 --> 00:05:33,417
So...

100
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:37,838
I kind of didn't know
what was gonna happen.

101
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:41,884
Me neither, that's why I said
I didn't wanna see you.

102
00:05:42,384 --> 00:05:44,887
I said, "No, man,
we'd better not see each other,

103
00:05:45,596 --> 00:05:47,139
"let's do it in the house."

104
00:05:47,431 --> 00:05:49,725
Oh, but I wanted to see you, to talk...

105
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,604
I wanted to too. But I didn't think
that was the best option, you know?

106
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:55,439
Because...

107
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:59,902
Carol, how do you like it
seeing them working things out?

108
00:06:00,194 --> 00:06:01,820
I'm loving it, man.

109
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,492
I think it's cute when Carol
is paying attention... Hit pause!

110
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:11,371
Carol, she doesn't pay attention
to things, she falls asleep sometimes.

111
00:06:11,747 --> 00:06:12,664
Sometimes...

112
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:17,252
She's so excited, she liked that couple
so much that she watched, rooted for them.

113
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:22,966
What do you think is gonna happen
from now on with that couple?

114
00:06:23,175 --> 00:06:25,260
Titto, I believe in love.

115
00:06:26,637 --> 00:06:29,973
- Really?
- You believe in whore's love, right?

116
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:32,893
I want you to understand
that I believe in love.

117
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:36,063
I believe in love, I bet on love...

118
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:40,234
Anyway. Man, when I saw them,
you know, right?

119
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:45,155
I said, "Guys, they'll stay together."
Then they fought, you said, "They won't!"

120
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:47,241
I said, "They will!" And look now!

121
00:06:47,241 --> 00:06:51,036
I think there's a great chance
they stay together, because

122
00:06:51,245 --> 00:06:55,040
I think all the situations that happened,
those arguments...

123
00:06:55,415 --> 00:07:00,796
those crises, I think their relationship
matured because of all those things.

124
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:04,049
I can see
that they're much more mature...

125
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:05,801
The level of the conversation!

126
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:09,555
...and they're mature enough
to talk about the relationship

127
00:07:09,555 --> 00:07:13,392
and the things that can change,
improve, their mistakes...

128
00:07:13,517 --> 00:07:17,312
Now, they're talking to find a way.

129
00:07:17,312 --> 00:07:21,233
- It's a walk, a peaceful walk.
- Discovering new places.

130
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:23,443
I never came here.

131
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:26,530
- I've only heard about it.
- I've only heard about it.

132
00:07:27,239 --> 00:07:30,617
Oh, guys, they made a video.

133
00:07:30,868 --> 00:07:33,829
Oh, my couple! My favorite couple, guys!

134
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:36,790
That's a fucking great couple.

135
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,126
We'll get in the water naked.

136
00:07:39,459 --> 00:07:42,129
The good thing is this place is deserted.

137
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:45,674
Oh, I'm gonna cry, guys!

138
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:49,136
Oh, that's cute!

139
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:52,598
I'll tell them to invite just me
for their wedding.

140
00:07:52,723 --> 00:07:55,475
-"Just me"?
- You didn't bet on their love.

141
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:59,396
Baby, the important thing
is always believing in the best,

142
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:01,940
I bet on happiness. If that's happiness,

143
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:03,483
- cheers!
- You?

144
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:07,529
Mostly you. You don't get
in the church, my brother.

145
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,199
Hey, are you going there yet?

146
00:08:10,324 --> 00:08:16,246
- You're dressed for the wedding now.
- I'm the maid of honor!

147
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,414
I'll even sing...

148
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:20,042
Imagine Carol getting in the church!

149
00:08:20,334 --> 00:08:23,128
I'll even...

150
00:08:23,837 --> 00:08:27,007
No! She'll get in and say,
"The debauchery's gonna start."

151
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:28,926
I'll sing at the altar!

152
00:08:29,259 --> 00:08:32,804
What are you gonna sing?
Pretend this is the mic.

153
00:08:32,804 --> 00:08:35,265
"The debauchery's gonna end!"

154
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:39,478
He proposed to me
But I don't get it

155
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:42,856
I'm a fucking slut
I live in the moment

156
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,691
Your family...

157
00:08:44,691 --> 00:08:47,319
This is not for you guys, you'll marry.

158
00:08:47,486 --> 00:08:49,112
Out of the blue!

159
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,077
Naked?

160
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,872
- Swimming naked?
- Yes!

161
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,625
Oh, it's there! Go, sister. Go.

162
00:09:02,084 --> 00:09:04,795
Are they both naked in the lagoon?

163
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,963
It'll happen!

164
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:08,674
Have sex, girl, real good!

165
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,927
Jeez, that boto vibe, right, sister?

166
00:09:12,177 --> 00:09:15,472
The lagoon of Floripa.
The lagoon of Floripa.

167
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,910
Somebody has to work, right?

168
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:40,080
- You have to pay all...
- It's not easy!

169
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:41,999
Good evening.

170
00:09:50,716 --> 00:09:54,344
Bro, is he drinking
other people's drinks, man? Ramon...

171
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:55,971
Did he do that?

172
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:58,598
No, it's worse, he has his own drink.

173
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:03,145
- I think that drink is his.
- He's drinking behind the manager's back!

174
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:04,896
He fixed one for himself.

175
00:10:04,896 --> 00:10:06,857
- Not in secret!
- He's like this!

176
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:08,984
With the tray.

177
00:10:09,276 --> 00:10:12,988
Girl... he's just like us,
with our former bosses.

178
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:21,538
Bro, this is getting to the end.
He's raising hell, man.

179
00:10:22,414 --> 00:10:24,291
It's his.

180
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:29,588
Did you do like Ramon when you worked,
you took one drink and drank two?

181
00:10:29,713 --> 00:10:30,589
No!

182
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:31,840
I didn't do that!

183
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:33,884
When I worked in the bakery...

184
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:35,302
God, that's my dream!

185
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:37,220
- You worked in a bakery?
- I did!

186
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,139
Girl, you worked in a bakery?

187
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,766
No way, girl!

188
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:44,644
The cold cuts were expensive.
There was a very expensive cheese.

189
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:50,192
So, I would go and slice some for me
and eat it. But that was too much.

190
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,819
My dream is working in a bakery.

191
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,489
I used to eat soft cheese all the time.

192
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,532
Tell us a story from Malhação.

193
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:00,243
When he was ugly, really ugly.

194
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:05,332
While doing the Malhação soap opera,
the weirdest job I did was painting gates.

195
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,917
What was your craziest job?

196
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:10,379
Man, I sent my résumé to Bob's,
but never got the call.

197
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:13,340
I was never accepted.

198
00:11:14,549 --> 00:11:17,594
Yes, Bob's.
So now, when I go to Bob's Burgers,

199
00:11:17,928 --> 00:11:20,889
I bring a ton of friends,

200
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:24,726
and I buy milkshakes for all of them!

201
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:26,186
Did you work at Habib's?

202
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,479
Yes, girl, at Habib's.

203
00:11:27,646 --> 00:11:29,231
Those are the best sfiha!

204
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:31,650
I used to work at Habib's.

205
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:35,278
- They accepted me, but...
- What we say here doesn't go on air...

206
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:36,363
We'd be fucked.

207
00:11:36,363 --> 00:11:39,699
I quit because I was not allowed
to wear jeans.

208
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:42,953
I don't blame Habib's,
but Marcos, the manager.

209
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,039
Go back there, girl, go back!

210
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,291
How long ago?

211
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:53,505
My career started
four, five years ago...

212
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,174
- So, five years ago.
- Is Marcos there?

213
00:11:56,633 --> 00:12:01,638
When I went back there to visit friends,
he wasn't there anymore.

214
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,014
Let's hit play!

215
00:12:03,181 --> 00:12:06,601
Let's hit play,
I wanna know what's gonna happen.

216
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:11,440
Do you think Ramon
will do the dishes till the end?

217
00:12:11,898 --> 00:12:13,900
I didn't work, only Murilo did them.

218
00:12:14,234 --> 00:12:15,819
I doubt it, I trust Anna.

219
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:19,656
- I did nothing at the bar.
- You said, "I'll make the drinks."

220
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,576
You nailed it, you always do, every time.

221
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:25,704
Shut up, girl.
Stop being so full of yourself.

222
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:29,124
Stop it, girl. Stop it, stop it.

223
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,126
Do you get one for me?

224
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:36,381
- What are you talking about?
- Stop being so full of yourself.

225
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:41,344
- We're family!
- Not a family. You don't listen,

226
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:45,056
fucking prick!
Impolite, rude, stupid, ignorant!

227
00:12:45,557 --> 00:12:51,021
I'm not the only one who thinks this way.

228
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:54,024
I'm a woman and have the guts to say it.

229
00:12:54,191 --> 00:12:58,904
Tay and Murilo are not giving a shit,
they just want to be together. Look.

230
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:02,365
No, it's not. It's not like this.

231
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:05,160
I didn't say he's a prick to me.
He is to you.

232
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,704
- You didn't?
- Not to me. He is to you!

233
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:10,707
I say, "As a friend,
Ramon is another person."

234
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,418
The same way, Murilo was a prick to me...

235
00:13:13,752 --> 00:13:17,255
- but he was never to you guys.
- And she was a prick to me too.

236
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:19,716
She started a fight out of the blue!

237
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:23,428
Ramon was always a prick to you,
but never to me!

238
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:26,848
- Of course, not to you.
- But he was to you.

239
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,518
The problem's not
about Nath and Tay, right?

240
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,020
But Nath's dragging Tay into that, right?

241
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:36,816
Guys, it started with Anna and Mu,
with Ramon, Ramon and Nath, Nath and Tay?

242
00:13:37,025 --> 00:13:39,194
I did this, and you argued with me?

243
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:40,820
Drink it, sit down.

244
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:42,739
Drink it and sit down, my ass!

245
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:45,617
Out of the blue?

246
00:13:45,784 --> 00:13:47,619
Jeez, that's nonsense.

247
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:51,748
Somebody please explain it to me.
I didn't understand anything, girl.

248
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,876
It started with Anna and Ramon,

249
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:59,047
then Ramon dragged Nath into it.

250
00:13:59,256 --> 00:14:01,841
Nath started to drag Tay into it.

251
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:05,428
Then she provoked Tay saying,
"I have the guts to say it,

252
00:14:05,428 --> 00:14:07,013
"and everybody here knows

253
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,933
-"I tell it how it is"
- She said Tay called Ramon

254
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,435
- a prick too.
- That he was a prick to Tay,

255
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:14,980
- but not to the rest!
- Then it all started.

256
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:17,148
A drink was thrown in somebody's face,

257
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,568
which I think is extremely rude.

258
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:21,736
Now tell me, have you ever

259
00:14:22,279 --> 00:14:26,032
lost your temper
and thrown a drink at somebody?

260
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:29,578
- No, never!
- Tell the truth, John?

261
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:34,833
- Have you ever done it? On purpose?
- Yes!

262
00:14:35,125 --> 00:14:36,585
Yes, I have!

263
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:39,087
I know I'm wrong, Don't judge me, okay?

264
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,213
No judging!

265
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,923
You'll say I'm like Nath.

266
00:14:42,132 --> 00:14:43,425
We'd never do that!

267
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:44,467
John Drops,

268
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,136
you're here to judge them.

269
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:49,180
I don't wanna be judged by you!
I know I am wrong.

270
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,348
I won't judge you.

271
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:53,435
This is what happened.
I was talking to someone,

272
00:14:53,435 --> 00:14:56,896
and then we started arguing.
He was a former friend.

273
00:14:57,022 --> 00:15:00,775
He started telling me
a lot of horrible things,

274
00:15:01,026 --> 00:15:06,656
things I didn't agree with. I was drunk,
okay, guys? I threw the drink like to say,

275
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:11,453
"Stop talking, I wanna talk."
Instead of saying it, I threw the drink.

276
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:14,247
- So you attacked him.
- Was I wrong?

277
00:15:14,664 --> 00:15:16,207
- I wasn't wrong.
- It happens...

278
00:15:16,374 --> 00:15:17,792
everybody makes mistakes.

279
00:15:17,959 --> 00:15:19,044
It's wrong!

280
00:15:19,044 --> 00:15:20,253
It is, but it happens.

281
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:22,964
Okay, everybody makes mistakes.

282
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:26,009
But throwing a drink feels really good!

283
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:27,636
I was singing...

284
00:15:27,636 --> 00:15:29,262
I'm Carol from Niterói...

285
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:34,059
Then a smart ass
threw a glass of beer at me.

286
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,311
I had another concert, later...

287
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:37,854
Did he wet you?

288
00:15:38,063 --> 00:15:39,272
Yeah, he did.

289
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:44,027
I went to the dressing room,
got all buckets of ice and water,

290
00:15:44,361 --> 00:15:47,030
I put all of them together,
removed the soda,

291
00:15:47,030 --> 00:15:50,950
carried that all the way there
and threw it in his face.

292
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:52,369
"Removed the soda."

293
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:55,789
I think that Nath throwing the drink
in Ramon's face

294
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,918
tells us more about her,
and how much she likes Ramon.

295
00:16:00,293 --> 00:16:04,214
We said she was very classy
the whole season, you know?

296
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:07,133
- I take back what I said.
- I think she waited...

297
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:10,887
She didn't wait,
that's not the first nuisance she caused.

298
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:13,431
Nath's totally clueless.

299
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:33,368
He taught me what I deserved and needed.
And I don't need a boy like him!

300
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:35,120
You said you didn't like him!

301
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:37,539
I didn't care when he brought girls here.

302
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:41,209
You fought with Murilo?
"Jerk, you're disgusting..."

303
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:44,838
- We dated!
- Whatever! We defended each other!

304
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:47,590
Oh, Nath, come on!

305
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:50,093
You told me you didn't like Ramon.

306
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:51,594
For me it wasn't wrong...

307
00:16:51,803 --> 00:16:53,096
Why's she doing that?

308
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,389
You don't defend me.

309
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:55,557
You never said...

310
00:16:55,849 --> 00:16:57,684
A true friend

311
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,477
- not only defends you.
- I agree.

312
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:03,398
A true friend scolds you too.

313
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:05,859
See, she's fighting with Tay.

314
00:17:05,859 --> 00:17:08,653
What bothers me in that situation

315
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:12,532
is that Nath doesn't listen
to what people are saying.

316
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:16,578
Nobody can give her any advice,
she doesn't stop talking.

317
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:21,833
She's never wrong.
You can't help people like that.

318
00:17:22,167 --> 00:17:27,088
And I think it's bad when she demands
people to take her side,

319
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:28,631
even if she's wrong.

320
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,800
A true friend supports you during both

321
00:17:30,925 --> 00:17:32,677
- good and bad times.
- Exactly.

322
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:34,554
- Like this.
- It's different.

323
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:38,933
Your friend will scold you and say,
"Hey, you're totally wrong."

324
00:17:39,392 --> 00:17:41,978
I've already admitted being a phony.
So are you.

325
00:17:42,353 --> 00:17:44,272
If I were, I wouldn't say it.

326
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:46,316
Finally, right?

327
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:47,442
You hate that...

328
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:48,485
Jeez!

329
00:17:48,485 --> 00:17:49,569
Fuck!

330
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:51,654
I don't like him at all!

331
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,865
Yeah, that's it.

332
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:58,077
I'm very sad to see
two friends get to this point.

333
00:17:58,203 --> 00:18:01,331
- Girl, Nath is wasted.
- I didn't like it! I'm not happy!

334
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:04,417
Yes! Nath is totally wasted!

335
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:09,297
The girls are trying to open her eyes,
then they begin to say

336
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,717
something they might regret!
That's it!

337
00:18:12,926 --> 00:18:15,845
Nath doesn't even remember what she did!

338
00:18:15,845 --> 00:18:19,307
But I think Tay
is being reasonable, you know?

339
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:23,770
"When I start being true to Murilo."
It's all wrong.

340
00:18:23,937 --> 00:18:26,689
- Why?
- You have to be honest, always!

341
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,567
She's wrong, everybody agrees with that,

342
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:34,823
but I think we can't be judgmental.
I was like this, I had this attitude,

343
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:38,284
I didn't listen to anybody,
I thought I was right.

344
00:18:38,535 --> 00:18:39,911
But we mature, right?

345
00:18:39,911 --> 00:18:41,996
You have to be honest all the time!

346
00:18:42,956 --> 00:18:44,207
All the time!

347
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:52,549
- Fuck!
- Fuck! What an awesome party!

348
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:53,633
Girl, I know it!

349
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:54,884
I sang at P12, bitch!

350
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,262
- P12 is the best!
- My God, I know!

351
00:18:58,012 --> 00:19:00,181
- So?
- I don't know, I wish I was him.

352
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:01,641
Did you get something?

353
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,476
- Nothing?
- No. I got money.

354
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:08,314
You get money making close-up,
anything in your life. I wanna know

355
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,109
- if you hooked up with a guy.
- No, I had fun.

356
00:19:11,317 --> 00:19:12,652
Have you been to P12?

357
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:16,322
Yes, I have and I was dating at that time.

358
00:19:16,781 --> 00:19:17,866
I performed there.

359
00:19:18,783 --> 00:19:20,118
Go-go-boy performance?

360
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:33,798
That party was a real trigger warning
of the vacation.

361
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:35,800
Man, what an awesome party!

362
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:40,513
See the gay people dancing? I like daytime
parties, you can see who you'll kiss.

363
00:19:40,638 --> 00:19:44,559
Matheus is there too, John,
the gay guy is there! Did you see him?

364
00:19:45,101 --> 00:19:47,687
He is there!
I wonder who will nail him.

365
00:19:47,937 --> 00:19:50,315
Oh, Renatinho's up there! Look, Renatinho!

366
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:55,153
Renatinho, my love!

367
00:19:56,905 --> 00:20:02,619
Ítalo's there, Renatinho's hooking up
with Anna, and it's all cool, is that it?

368
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:07,498
Man, it's the last day. Theoretically,
everybody knows each other, so,

369
00:20:07,707 --> 00:20:11,669
there's no such thing as saying,
"Oh, not today." Baby, tomorrow

370
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:16,925
is another day, you gotta go back to work,
to college... I would kiss everybody.

371
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,093
Triple kiss!

372
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:23,181
Oh, that's delicious!

373
00:20:23,932 --> 00:20:25,850
Hey! That's it!

374
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,438
- Fuck!
- Go Matheus!

375
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,690
Matheus nailed it!

376
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,067
#NAILEDIT

377
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,694
The gay people nailed it, baby.

378
00:20:36,861 --> 00:20:38,446
- Look at that glass!
- God!

379
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:43,368
Buddy, what a dream kiss!

380
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:47,705
Pabllo threw the glass on the floor
and the butt in my face.

381
00:20:48,081 --> 00:20:51,751
- I don't know what hurt the most.
- He represented! Guys,

382
00:20:52,043 --> 00:20:53,753
I chose to love Matheus.

383
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:58,466
I'll toast to Matheus. I broke my glass
because of you, Matheus, gorgeous!

384
00:20:58,466 --> 00:21:00,677
And also threw the butt in my face.

385
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:04,013
Girl, you celebrated the World Cup goal.

386
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,183
- They nailed it!
- There's a hook-up vibe at this party!

387
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,355
- I wanted to be there!
- And it's cool. Everybody's really free!

388
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,607
I love afternoon parties, guys.

389
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,442
I wanna see that at night!

390
00:21:16,693 --> 00:21:21,114
Good evening, guys! I wanna see
everybody full of energy, partying a lot.

391
00:21:21,572 --> 00:21:23,574
I present to you, Kevinho!

392
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:26,911
You know what's up

393
00:21:27,245 --> 00:21:29,163
I'm gonna...

394
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:30,581
De Janeiro

395
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:33,793
Let's go to the cage

396
00:21:34,210 --> 00:21:37,130
Everything's fine

397
00:21:37,422 --> 00:21:39,507
A thin mustache and a hair cut
She looked at me

398
00:21:39,841 --> 00:21:43,219
I looked at her and said
Come with Kevin and Chris

399
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:46,014
Sit, sit, sit, sit

400
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,518
Everybody jump and sing!

401
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:52,311
It's Kevin and Chris.

402
00:21:52,562 --> 00:21:54,063
It's now!

403
00:21:56,274 --> 00:21:59,110
Go, Lexa, go!

404
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,778
Oh, my knee can't take it!

405
00:22:01,362 --> 00:22:02,321
That's it!

406
00:22:02,572 --> 00:22:05,742
- Guys, I don't wanna sit down.
- I'm old, jeez!

407
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:07,827
John broke the couch!

408
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:10,204
He really did!

409
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,418
I can't see it.

410
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:20,089
Let's have a toast to us too.
Come on, guys. Just to celebrate our end.

411
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:23,885
I raise my glass to welcome Lexa

412
00:22:24,052 --> 00:22:26,721
and Jerry Smith, who nailed it.

413
00:22:27,055 --> 00:22:29,640
They nailed it, right?
They did a great job.

414
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:31,893
You totally nailed it.

415
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:34,937
I want to say I'm very happy to share

416
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:41,277
these moments with you. This vacation
was wonderful. Please, say what you want.

417
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:44,697
I'm very happy to be with you,
to get such a warm welcome

418
00:22:45,114 --> 00:22:47,408
from all of you.

419
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,118
Thanks for your kindness.

420
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:52,121
I'm very happy
to be in this amazing season.

421
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,624
- All together.
- Thanks for the laughter.

422
00:22:54,749 --> 00:22:59,087
All the stories, all those moments,
you're so wonderful! I already admired you

423
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:04,175
and this show made me like you
even more. I loved seeing people fucking!

424
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:07,845
I loved commenting with you on everything.
Thank you so much!

425
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:12,517
I'd like to thank you because I could be
watching this alone and talking by myself.

426
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:14,268
We got free drinks!

427
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:17,063
We got free food and drinks!

428
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:22,235
Unfortunately, we can't go out
to parties, or on trips, but we...

429
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,320
got a taste of it watching them...

430
00:23:24,445 --> 00:23:26,614
We stuck to the social distancing.

431
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:27,990
We did it. Nicely put!

432
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:31,452
Welcome, Jerrynho and Lexa.
I'm very grateful

433
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:37,792
because Amazon brought us back to watch
Wild and Free: Florianópolis Season Two.

434
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:43,714
- Hope we have season three!
- Guys, I'm very happy. I smiled, I cried.

435
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,092
- You slept.
- You slept.

436
00:23:47,677 --> 00:23:49,804
I slept very little.

437
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:54,350
You have no idea how happy I am.

438
00:23:54,684 --> 00:23:59,814
I'm Pabllo's biggest fan, she knows it.
I'm Titto's biggest fan,

439
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:02,817
I'm your biggest fan, you know, you know.

440
00:24:03,192 --> 00:24:07,864
I'm really happy. Thanks, Amazon.
Thanks, God. Thanks, Universe...

441
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:09,740
- You're welcome!
- ...for this.

442
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:10,950
Wild and Free!

443
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,743
- Is that it?
- Thanks, guys!

444
00:24:12,743 --> 00:24:14,829
This is what life is all about

445
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:17,165
Making love every day

446
00:24:17,498 --> 00:24:20,918
- It's not finished yet, hit play!
- It's not finished yet, wait!

447
00:24:21,043 --> 00:24:26,757
- There's still gonna be lots of sex!
- I learned that from Lexa, right?

448
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:31,012
Out of the blue! I love it.

449
00:24:31,345 --> 00:24:33,264
Debauchery! Let's get wild!

450
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:35,433
"Debauchery! Let's get wild!"

451
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:41,898
- Looks like New Year's Eve with family.
- Delicious! If I don't see you again...

452
00:24:41,898 --> 00:24:45,276
- Happy New Year, Merry Christmas!
- I love retrospective moments.

453
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:50,448
- Everybody looks back.
- I don't like it, I feel like crying.

454
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:52,325
Oh, that's my crush!

455
00:24:52,325 --> 00:24:55,536
- What a beautiful image.
- I feel like crying.

456
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:57,538
Don't cry, Pabllo!

457
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:01,500
They became my children, you know?
Really, you get to love them.

458
00:25:01,751 --> 00:25:02,585
Nath...

459
00:25:02,919 --> 00:25:05,171
I began to like each one of them.

460
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:09,800
- Fuck, I'm getting the chills.
- I wanna go to Floripa!

461
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:11,719
- I wanna go now!
- Invite me.

462
00:25:24,232 --> 00:25:27,902
Oh, fuck! The last afterparty!

463
00:25:28,069 --> 00:25:32,240
We're back, this is gonna blow

464
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,742
I'm back!

465
00:25:39,497 --> 00:25:43,000
What a delicious afterparty!

466
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:50,633
She's totally naked, with just
shaving cream on her privates.

467
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:08,526
Girl, did you see what an awesome party?

468
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,278
The Afterparty was the best!

469
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:12,446
Afterparty was the best!

470
00:26:12,446 --> 00:26:14,156
The first good afterparty!

471
00:26:14,448 --> 00:26:17,618
There were naked people,
Carol's sleeping, crazy!

472
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,329
- It was like Carnival.
- Yes, like micareta.

473
00:26:20,663 --> 00:26:23,457
It was an orgy!
It was not a micareta at all!

474
00:26:23,624 --> 00:26:26,460
Seriously, I wish I was
at that afterparty more

475
00:26:26,711 --> 00:26:27,837
than at the party.

476
00:26:27,837 --> 00:26:32,591
Oh, girl, I wish I was at everything,
at the house... At the party, at the...

477
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:38,556
Guys, it's coming to an end,

478
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:41,350
but I need help with one thing.

479
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,311
Where will we have

480
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:47,023
- the next one?
- Dude, I can't believe it!

481
00:26:47,148 --> 00:26:48,899
Man!

482
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:51,027
Oh, my God!

483
00:26:51,277 --> 00:26:53,571
- Season three.
- There's gonna be

484
00:26:53,946 --> 00:26:57,700
- season three and contract renewal!
- A lifelong contract, fuck!

485
00:26:58,034 --> 00:27:00,453
I'm gonna work here one more year!

486
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,372
Jerry, where do you want
the next Wild to be?

487
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:07,209
- Wild in Bahia.
- Oh, imagine Wild in Trancoso!

488
00:27:07,209 --> 00:27:11,005
- I'm from Salvador.
- I want Wild to be in Recife.

489
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:13,466
It should be in the northeast.

490
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:14,550
Wild in Niterói.

491
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:17,762
I think Wild should be in BH,
it's the city.

492
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:19,930
BH really is a party city.

493
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:23,809
BH is awesome. It'd be great
because it's near my home.

494
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:27,063
- Rio would be really cool.
- I think it should be overseas

495
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:31,359
- because imagine how they'd be overseas.
- Wild in New York.

496
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,903
Wild in New York,
Massachusetts, California.

497
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,030
But let me tell you something.

498
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:39,158
They'll go to New York,
you stay here, you know that?

499
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:40,326
We're not going?

500
00:27:40,743 --> 00:27:43,287
- Make no mistake, okay?
- No!

501
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:44,663
Let me tell you...

502
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:48,125
- Guys, I have two things to say.
- Lexa has two things to say.

503
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:50,086
No, I'm great, I'm awesome.

504
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:51,337
My drink's finished.
