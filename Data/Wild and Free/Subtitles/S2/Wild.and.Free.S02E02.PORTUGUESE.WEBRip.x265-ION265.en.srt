WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS 2
THE REVIEW

2
00:00:08,134 --> 00:00:10,010
- I'm here!
- Guys, I missed you.

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:13,389
You're spitting in the back of my head.

4
00:00:13,389 --> 00:00:17,393
- I'm anxious.
- What an upgrade we got here.

5
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:20,104
- Yeah, it's true.
- It's beautiful, right?

6
00:00:20,104 --> 00:00:21,689
Good!

7
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:23,816
- This is much better.
- I'm shocked!

8
00:00:23,941 --> 00:00:25,818
I'm very anxious for season two.

9
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,529
Last summer I was on Titto's lap.

10
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:31,699
Thank God, I asked... I said I'd only come

11
00:00:31,824 --> 00:00:36,871
- if you stayed away from me. Thanks a lot.
- I wish we were closer, but we can't.

12
00:00:37,371 --> 00:00:40,124
I'm very happy to be here with my friends

13
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:43,377
for the second season
of Wild and Free: Florianópolis 2.

14
00:00:43,627 --> 00:00:47,256
But now we have two wonderful additions.

15
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:53,053
My friend Lexa, wonderful, impressive.
And my dear friend Jerry Smith.

16
00:00:53,179 --> 00:00:57,683
- Girl, are you ready for gossip?
- I am. I can't wait for all the gossip.

17
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,518
You're not ready for gossip.

18
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:01,896
Oh, Lord, that's the way I like it.

19
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:05,399
Jerrynho, baby,
have you ever been to Floripa?

20
00:01:06,317 --> 00:01:07,943
- Yes.
- Have you?

21
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:12,573
No, not Floripa, but Santa Catarina...
I enjoyed myself a lot there.

22
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:14,700
Tell us more about it.

23
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:17,661
- Why did you go there?
- Do you like video games?

24
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:21,207
"Do you like video games?"

25
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:27,213
For those who didn't understand,
this is her pick-up line.

26
00:01:27,213 --> 00:01:31,217
She invites guys to play video games
at her place and screws them.

27
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:34,762
- Yeah. Better watch out.
- Our studio's changed a bit.

28
00:01:34,762 --> 00:01:39,850
We're following all guidelines
from health authorities for COVID,

29
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,936
but Titto is devastated. Right, man?

30
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:45,439
He thought he would kiss me and seduce me
this season.

31
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,400
We're gonna have to wait
until next season.

32
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:52,238
- But we'll exchange some nudes, right?
- What's this bullshit?

33
00:01:52,363 --> 00:01:53,906
Right, honey?

34
00:01:53,906 --> 00:01:56,909
- Are you sharing nudes during quarantine?
- No.

35
00:01:57,034 --> 00:02:00,329
- What about receiving them?
- I don't do these kind of things.

36
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:03,165
- I just send out nudes.
- What's that face, Lexa?

37
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:07,586
A face of someone who wants to know
about all of her friends' gossip.

38
00:02:07,586 --> 00:02:11,882
I see nudes all the time, anytime I want.
I've got my go-to guy.

39
00:02:12,258 --> 00:02:14,927
But it's good having friends' nudes,
you know?

40
00:02:15,052 --> 00:02:19,723
I like having my friends' nudes because
that's when you can exchange favors.

41
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:22,518
What do you mean?
I can't send nudes to a friend!

42
00:02:22,685 --> 00:02:26,689
Like "Hey, dude, what's up?
Did you get my dick pic?"

43
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:28,399
What are the odds, man?

44
00:02:28,399 --> 00:02:30,818
I said to Pabllo, "Good morning."

45
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:35,114
- I've sent them to Pabblo, before.
- My friends have some sexy pictures.

46
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:38,659
- And we exchange them.
- How am I supposed to help my friend?

47
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:40,286
Girl, after some booze?

48
00:02:40,452 --> 00:02:43,998
I send them! It's like,
"Girl, look how wonderful this is."

49
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:46,959
- I love it.
- Yeah, when you're pointing north...

50
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,213
They say, "Fuck, your thing is huge, bro.
How is your thing?"

51
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:54,133
- You can send it, okay?
- Men never send them,

52
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:58,053
never send nudes when they're 'offline'.

53
00:02:58,053 --> 00:03:02,808
Do you know anybody who sends
their picture with a limp dick?

54
00:03:02,808 --> 00:03:04,476
Only if it's stiff.

55
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,688
It's sad when they send it offline.

56
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:12,818
- No. You can't send a limp dick.
- I like dicks, you know? Hard, limp.

57
00:03:12,943 --> 00:03:16,280
- It doesn't matter.
- I like to see the worm grow...

58
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,327
I'm dying to know what they've been up to
the last summer in Floripa.

59
00:03:21,535 --> 00:03:25,205
How I miss the times we were allowed
to get together!

60
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:30,085
It's good to remember that this vacation
was recorded before the pandemic.

61
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:35,382
They're not actors, there's no script,
everything is real here.

62
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:38,218
Let's talk less and hit play?

63
00:03:38,427 --> 00:03:39,887
- Let's do it.
- Let's go!

64
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:43,265
- I'm dying to watch it.
- Here we go, Brazil!

65
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:55,736
Look!

66
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,405
And they're friends, right?

67
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:01,283
I've missed you.

68
00:04:03,577 --> 00:04:05,162
You look beautiful!

69
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:07,206
"Back to the game," that's right.

70
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:08,958
Jeez, you look thin, right?

71
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,626
You... Look!

72
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,879
- That's me meeting Lexa today.
- They're like us.

73
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:18,550
- Jeez, girl, you're great!
- They're beautiful! Screw you, guys.

74
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:22,596
They're great now. I wonder
if they forgot the fights they had.

75
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:25,265
Never, girl! It's that thing, right?

76
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:27,851
We can forget, but we don't forgive.

77
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:31,563
- If you drink, the problem comes up.
- Yes, it does.

78
00:04:33,524 --> 00:04:37,611
- Guys, where's Blondie?
- I don't know. She sent an audio message

79
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:41,532
- and I waited to hear it with you.
- Hi, Tay, how are you, girl?

80
00:04:41,532 --> 00:04:46,328
I got caught up in work in São Paulo,
I won't be able to party with you guys.

81
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:47,830
Bye, girl.

82
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:49,581
No!

83
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,378
- No! I can't believe this!
- No, Blondie, no! Please!

84
00:04:55,045 --> 00:04:56,213
Blondie is not coming.

85
00:04:56,213 --> 00:05:00,676
Jeez, I'm glad Anna is coming.
Or our team would be left shorthanded.

86
00:05:01,051 --> 00:05:03,595
- I wonder who Anna is?
- Carol,

87
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:06,598
- who's this Anna?
- I wonder if it's Anaconda.

88
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:14,606
-"Anaconda!"
- We've seen Anaconda in the first summer.

89
00:05:14,606 --> 00:05:16,483
Ramon and I are friends.

90
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:18,527
Are you hooking up with each other?

91
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,821
I don't think so. I hope not.

92
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:26,994
- Nath was able to be friends with Ramon.
- Meaning there's some hope.

93
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:30,706
When you say, "Certainly not",
it's something... There's still a risk.

94
00:05:30,706 --> 00:05:33,459
The way she said it,
it's like, "Certainly, we are."

95
00:05:33,459 --> 00:05:39,089
Man, let me tell you, I'd never expect
this from Nath and Ramon. "Good friends."

96
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:42,176
- I think she's mature.
- I think it's fancy, cool.

97
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:46,638
It's like a game.
"We're good friends and we can kiss..."

98
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:50,225
Nath said she broke up with Ramon,
they're good friends,

99
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:54,646
but they fought so much that I thought
they'd not speak to each other anymore.

100
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:59,651
Girl, I think they're gonna hook up
with each other, you know?

101
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:04,740
I wanna see it, you know what?
When they go out, see somebody hooking up.

102
00:06:04,907 --> 00:06:07,284
- Because they didn't see it.
- Yeah.

103
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:11,663
He went to Santos, I went to Vitória.
We tried to stay together.

104
00:06:11,955 --> 00:06:17,169
Distance got in the way, you know?
We didn't like some things that happened.

105
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:19,880
We didn't like some things...

106
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,424
- That's it.
- Relationships are hard, guys.

107
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:27,012
Lexa, do you think Bia
and Luan will get back together?

108
00:06:27,012 --> 00:06:30,766
They are, girl.
There's gonna be lots of replays.

109
00:06:30,766 --> 00:06:33,977
I think forgiveness
depends on Luan's dick size.

110
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:36,814
- What, Carol?
- The size.

111
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:38,982
What size?

112
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,735
- Size doesn't matter.
- So, you won't forgive.

113
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,114
You know? If it's like this...

114
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:47,741
That's all forgiveness is about?

115
00:06:47,741 --> 00:06:51,620
I think forgiveness depends
on the size of the dick!

116
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:53,413
"THE SIZE OF THE DICK"

117
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,501
But what's the size of your forgiveness?

118
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,629
- Twenty-three...
- Twenty-three?

119
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:03,674
In order to forgive...
Twenty-three, twenty...

120
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:07,094
- Look, I'm unforgivable, then.
- What about the average? Never?

121
00:07:07,219 --> 00:07:10,139
- I'm talking about forgiveness.
- And with no forgiveness?

122
00:07:10,264 --> 00:07:11,640
Twenty-two.

123
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:15,561
- I went overboard with twenty-three.
- But you aim too high, fuck!

124
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:18,939
Twenty-three! I didn't know
you were making love to horses.

125
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:24,444
For God's sake! Holy shit... The dude has
a forearm hanging there, for God's sake.

126
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:27,990
It's hard to find something with 17.
Imagine 23.

127
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,534
Not where I come from.

128
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:32,578
Oh, yeah? So... Look.

129
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,914
I have footage.

130
00:07:40,002 --> 00:07:41,962
Does anybody want to drink?

131
00:07:42,254 --> 00:07:43,338
Finally, right?

132
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:46,049
Oh, my God, It's Anna!

133
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:50,429
Fuck! She's so hot!

134
00:07:50,804 --> 00:07:55,017
- Okay, honey, she came with a bottle!
- She came with a bottle.

135
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:57,853
I missed you, Floripa!

136
00:07:57,853 --> 00:07:59,813
Enter the house with the right foot.

137
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:03,901
- Guys, where's João?
- I wonder if João is in another car.

138
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:08,155
I think João is coming
in a car with a loudspeaker.

139
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,325
- I wanna see the look in their faces.
- Where's Joãozinho?

140
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:14,244
Where's Na... Where's Bia, bro?

141
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,956
Bia got out of there too, see?

142
00:08:18,123 --> 00:08:20,626
Look, Murilo and Tay! Acting like friends?

143
00:08:20,751 --> 00:08:22,419
"How are you, man? Are you good?"

144
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:25,380
If an ex talked to me like this,
I'd kill him.

145
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,049
"Are you good?"

146
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,676
"Are you good?" is...

147
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:32,888
Oh. Trigger warning.

148
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:37,893
Trigger warning. I don't know about
you guys, but I felt something there.

149
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,020
- Shaking?
- Shaking!

150
00:08:40,437 --> 00:08:42,648
I want that smell, he's shaking.

151
00:08:42,814 --> 00:08:46,276
Guys, let me tell you,
something is going to happen soon.

152
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,820
It's gonna be in the first episode.

153
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:51,657
They have all hooked up
with each other, baby.

154
00:08:52,241 --> 00:08:54,326
That's inevitable.

155
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:57,913
It's fucked up when your ex says,
"I can't forget your smell."

156
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:00,540
Girl, I'd hook up with everybody.

157
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:06,255
- Guys!
- Me...

158
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,882
- Let me tell you...
- That's a trigger warning.

159
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,592
It's all I've wanted now.

160
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:14,263
Dance, Jerry. Dance. Come!

161
00:09:14,763 --> 00:09:17,015
That was too much!

162
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:20,185
- It fell down.
- Put it in your pocket!

163
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:24,106
I almost did that a few minutes ago.

164
00:09:24,106 --> 00:09:26,733
The best thing is the rookies fucking up.

165
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:28,694
Who invited you? Fuck!

166
00:09:28,819 --> 00:09:32,322
- Don't talk about love.
- Sorry, guys.

167
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:34,950
What's this, Beatriz?

168
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:40,122
Look at those big asses... What's that?

169
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:43,000
Your pussy was showing in the pic.

170
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:45,502
What?

171
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:48,588
- What did he say to her?
- Guys, no!

172
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:52,384
- He didn't say that, no. Oh, no, guys.
- Rewind! For God's sake.

173
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:55,762
Your fucking pussy is showing!

174
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,764
The pussy was showing in the pic.

175
00:09:57,764 --> 00:09:59,683
'Course, such a big pussy.

176
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:03,353
Did he say her pussy was showing?

177
00:10:03,645 --> 00:10:07,524
Then she said, "Of course not."
and he said, "Such a big pussy"!

178
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,443
- She said "Was it?"
- She was worried.

179
00:10:09,443 --> 00:10:11,653
- Yes, but he...
- He worried.

180
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:15,574
- But this was mean, right?
- No, it was.

181
00:10:15,741 --> 00:10:18,243
He wanted to set the mood for debauchery.

182
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:21,747
- I didn't like that.
- He wanted to touch her or...

183
00:10:21,747 --> 00:10:24,374
Seriously, after what he did, brother...

184
00:10:24,374 --> 00:10:27,294
I think he had to approach slowly.

185
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:30,297
And tell her,
"Baby, let me tell you a secret.

186
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,674
"Your cunt is showing."

187
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:37,846
But, Pabllo, if some boy told you,
"Your pussy... Your pussy is showing."

188
00:10:40,515 --> 00:10:44,061
Girl, first of all, I'd laugh a lot
and go, "Cut it out, dude."

189
00:10:44,227 --> 00:10:45,937
I'd say, look.

190
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:49,775
- Say it to me, Titto, please.
- John, let me tell you...

191
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:53,945
I'll get a lot of water and put it here.

192
00:10:54,279 --> 00:10:58,533
- Say it.
- John, your... Your pussy is showing.

193
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,204
Pabllo, help me, it's slipping out.

194
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:07,542
- Oh, girl.
- He'd say, "Buddy, I don't have a pussy.

195
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,462
"Man, your asshole
can turn into a pussy."

196
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,925
Guys, let's stop talking about pussy.

197
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:21,765
- Oh, no, he touched it! No.
- He touched it! He's clueless.

198
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:23,725
Totally clueless.

199
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,435
Jeez...

200
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:27,479
Now, come here, it's the boys' turn.

201
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:29,940
No, you saw that... No, guys, I can't.

202
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:33,985
Bro, she was... She didn't allow him
to touch... They weren't together.

203
00:11:34,569 --> 00:11:37,614
- Let me tell you, I thought...
- But what am I to you?

204
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:39,449
Why didn't you tell me?

205
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:40,575
Go fuck yourself.

206
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:43,745
Oh... Oh, no. Wrong!
He's all wrong, all wrong.

207
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:47,541
- Everybody! And why didn't you fix it?
- Go show your pussy outside.

208
00:11:47,749 --> 00:11:49,960
Beatriz, do whatever you want,
you're free.

209
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:53,839
- Guys, out of the blue!
- He's gonna start like that, man?

210
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:58,760
I've never seen anybody doing this
at a party. "Your pussy is showing."

211
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:03,265
Seriously, if he hooks up with her,
I won't say anything.

212
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,103
As far as I'm concerned, they didn't kiss,
they didn't hook up... He complained

213
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:10,272
about showing it.

214
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:14,109
She said, "Why didn't you fix it?"
Then he said, "What am I to you?"

215
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:17,446
Then why did he touch it
and say it was showing? Be quiet.

216
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:20,490
If you don't own it, man,
get out of there, dude!

217
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:25,245
I think it's happening something like,
he wants her to say what they are.

218
00:12:25,245 --> 00:12:28,415
Seriously. When she said that,
she made him feel important.

219
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:32,711
She just said, "If you're complaining,
why didn't you cover it?"

220
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:38,800
Buddy, maybe she made him feel important
in a way that she likes him, nothing real.

221
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:42,012
The worst of all is him telling her,

222
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:46,266
"Hey, you're free, do whatever you want."
If I'm free, I can show it off.

223
00:12:46,391 --> 00:12:49,227
- And you're pissing me off, man!
- Exactly!

224
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:54,357
I think his approach was very wrong,
touching that girl, you see?

225
00:12:54,357 --> 00:13:00,155
I think he did that to show other boys
he's with her, you know?

226
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:03,366
Jealousy, possession, ego,
and lack of respect, I think.

227
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:05,660
- Jealousy.
- But I loved her attitude.

228
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:11,500
- Like, "What? I'm not following you."
-"Why didn't you fix it?"

229
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,628
I think he lied.
She wasn't showing anything.

230
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:20,175
He just didn't like that situation,
he wanted to get her out of there.

231
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,135
What about you, Jerry Smith?

232
00:13:22,385 --> 00:13:27,724
And there's another thing,
when the panties are bothering,

233
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:31,394
you can feel it,
you can't show it and not feel it.

234
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,689
- I know it, I wear panties.
- When it happens to me,

235
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,859
I just feel it the day after, baby.

236
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:42,197
I think there's gonna be some tension
and a fight in the bus.

237
00:13:42,614 --> 00:13:44,157
- Hi, what's your name?
- Pedro.

238
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:45,742
Pedro, nice to meet you.

239
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:50,705
I love Anna!
Anna fixed that guy up with Nath.

240
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:53,792
Wonderful!

241
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:56,586
You can hook up with him!

242
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:59,756
In my opinion,
if I were to go to that house,

243
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:04,010
Murilo would be the one
to draw my attention,

244
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:05,554
So I see Murilo in the house.

245
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:10,725
I know he has a history
with that other girl.

246
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:15,772
I'm at a party.
I try to fix someone up with the chick...

247
00:14:15,981 --> 00:14:17,607
So Murilo is free.

248
00:14:17,774 --> 00:14:21,403
- Strategy, right? Great strategy, right?
- Yes. And I'm not like...

249
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:25,532
Say it again, I didn't take notes.
I liked that move.

250
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:29,953
- I've never thought of that.
- When I want somebody, I make my move.

251
00:14:30,078 --> 00:14:34,082
- Then suddenly we're hooking up, kissing.
- I have a move!

252
00:14:34,207 --> 00:14:39,004
Carol, if you were Nath,
would you notice it?

253
00:14:39,212 --> 00:14:42,716
Oh, I'm a thug, man. I'm...

254
00:14:42,716 --> 00:14:47,512
- What would you do to Anna?
- Why is she fixing this guy up for me?

255
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:52,350
Thinking the same way, according
to NASA's conspiracy theory from Carol,

256
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:56,479
she did all that, arranged all that.
Let's say she says, "Nath,

257
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:59,899
"since you hooked up with two guys,
I can hook up

258
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,610
"with the other?"

259
00:15:02,235 --> 00:15:04,821
Nath still likes him, but...

260
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:09,117
- She's free. How about that?
- I don't believe in this theory.

261
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:12,495
- I'm for honest talk.
- I'm for honest talk.

262
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:14,831
- Honest talk.
- Let's watch the episode!

263
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,545
Can I come in?

264
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:23,173
What did I tell you, fag?
What did I tell you?

265
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:25,675
Their first time was in the bathroom.

266
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:29,804
Mine is there too, I can do it.

267
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:33,058
- He's naked.
- I know he's naked.

268
00:15:33,058 --> 00:15:35,435
There must be a jerk
for everything, right?

269
00:15:35,435 --> 00:15:38,897
- Whoa!
- Anna said that?

270
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:41,524
Look!

271
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:47,697
Bia and that guy should sleep
in the sex room, right?

272
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:58,625
We can go to the bedroom.
There's whipped cream.

273
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:02,003
There's whipped cream...
I stained all my clothes.

274
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:03,463
Let's go to the room.

275
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:07,717
- Let's drink some more.
- We can drink tomorrow.

276
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:12,180
- Okay, but I wanted to have sex here too.
- So we're gonna have sex here.

277
00:16:12,305 --> 00:16:14,974
Okay, but I...

278
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,480
Guys!

279
00:16:22,482 --> 00:16:25,944
I'm shocked!

280
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:39,207
- Okay, honey, bathe in the seashore!
- Why are you crying, Mýkonos?

281
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,502
- Cry, Mýkonos. Cry!
- Why are you crying? Look!

282
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:47,465
- Nobody invited me to that bar.
- Bro, I'm shocked...

283
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:49,092
It's another bar!

284
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:53,388
- It could be Hard, instead of Soft.
- Guys, I'm jealous, I wish I was there!

285
00:16:55,682 --> 00:17:00,603
- I'd go out wearing bikini, look...
- She's thinking, "Let's party",

286
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:05,024
- but she'll work. Look, he's there.
- Carol liked the manager!

287
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:09,362
Let's watch this.

288
00:17:09,362 --> 00:17:12,157
I wanna keep it light.
You're not keeping it light.

289
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:14,284
This is good just when we have sex.
Okay?

290
00:17:14,284 --> 00:17:16,661
- It's like this?
- I won't bother you anymore.

291
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,705
- Jeez.
- It's good just when we have sex.

292
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:21,958
- I'm not gonna bother you anymore.
- Fag! I'd slap his face.

293
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:25,170
She repeated, "It's good
when we just have sex."

294
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:29,591
Bro, he really said that to her?
Seriously. He said,

295
00:17:29,591 --> 00:17:33,970
"I'm sorry, I made a terrible mistake.
I want you to be my children's mother."

296
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:38,391
The day after, he says, "It's good when
we just have sex." He's messing up!

297
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:43,271
Regardless of it being a man or a woman,
I think it's terrible to hear this.

298
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:45,482
Let's be honest,

299
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:49,527
now she has all the reasons
not to want to stay with him again.

300
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:53,907
I think so too, he started wrong,
because, bro, he started totally...

301
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:59,746
- After everything he did in...
- I can't help you anymore, Bia. Jeez...

302
00:17:59,913 --> 00:18:01,539
There's no way to support her!

303
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:04,626
Man, I can't put up with what he said.

304
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:07,462
It's clearly a trap. Now, get lost.

305
00:18:12,008 --> 00:18:17,180
Carol, what do you think? The situation
has gotten serious, everything is a mess.

306
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:19,098
Is she gonna hook up with him?

307
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:20,934
I think so.

308
00:18:20,934 --> 00:18:23,061
I also think she will.

309
00:18:23,228 --> 00:18:25,146
Because it's about the size...

310
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:30,109
- Carol sticks with this.
- Carol just talks about dick.

311
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:42,664
It's Murilo with the other chick.

312
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:48,795
Guys! Oh, no. Stop it, it's all over now!

313
00:18:50,839 --> 00:18:52,590
Where's my couple?

314
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:53,883
Wait.

315
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:55,677
- I think it's over.
- I don't.

316
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:58,972
- I don't think so.
- I think this could be the definite end

317
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:03,226
or something to make them fall in love
and say, "I can't stay away from you."

318
00:19:03,226 --> 00:19:07,063
- Something from their first fight.
- It'll be the trigger for a fight.

319
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:09,107
Or the first, remember.

320
00:19:09,232 --> 00:19:13,778
Man, everybody is cool. They're
the only two kissing in the bus.

321
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,029
Exactly... Yeah.

322
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:20,034
No, there's a funny fact about Anna.
Because she's new.

323
00:19:20,285 --> 00:19:23,746
- She observes a lot, you know?
- Very open-minded.

324
00:19:23,913 --> 00:19:28,001
She gets to know previous stuff.
She's looking into everything, man.

325
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:45,560
Look at Murilo going upstairs
with that girl!

326
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:50,607
- Murilo, don't let me down, Murilo!
- They're gonna have sex in the room.

327
00:19:50,607 --> 00:19:52,901
Don't let me down, Murilo!

328
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:57,947
- I said he wouldn't.
- What's that, bro?

329
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,490
Fuck! "Goodbye."

330
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:01,534
Tay is not, girl.

331
00:20:01,784 --> 00:20:05,997
- She said goodbye to her boy.
- Whoa, she's going upstairs.

332
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,790
- What's that?
- She'll see Murilo.

333
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:13,004
But she scouted the area, right?
She looked both sides.

334
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:16,549
Oh, my!

335
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:22,972
Whoa, man, get your fucking man!

336
00:20:23,181 --> 00:20:26,309
- But she was classy.
- Baby, she just walked away.

337
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:28,478
You think I'll sleep with somebody?

338
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:30,396
I didn't allow you...

339
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:34,817
- But if she did, it wouldn't be a problem.
- To whom did she say that?

340
00:20:34,984 --> 00:20:36,778
I thought she'd sleep with someone.

341
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:40,740
I think Murilo might have deduced this,
"If she brought a boy home,

342
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,785
"she'll have sex, so I'll have it too."

343
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,579
- I think so.
- He might have thought so.

344
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:49,749
- I think this might have happened.
- It's just...

345
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:52,377
It's just people don't plan that much.

346
00:20:52,543 --> 00:20:57,215
They were kissing
and looking at each other.

347
00:20:57,340 --> 00:21:00,218
- They were.
- You guys make a lot of plans.

348
00:21:00,843 --> 00:21:03,972
If she... He saw her hooking up
with some other guy and said,

349
00:21:04,097 --> 00:21:07,350
"Fuck, bro, I'm gonna have
to hook up with another chick

350
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,436
"because... She's gonna take
that guy to the house and..."

351
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:13,439
But why?

352
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:17,610
- You're hooking up with another guy.
- So he can hook up too.

353
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:21,656
From the bottom of my heart,
I hope Mu had hooked up

354
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:24,701
with that girl because he wanted,
because he felt like.

355
00:21:24,701 --> 00:21:28,329
I think everything is fine, he's free.
What is wrong about

356
00:21:28,329 --> 00:21:33,209
Tay and Murilo's relationship,
is that they get other people involved.

357
00:21:33,334 --> 00:21:36,004
- She doesn't give a shit.
- That chick with Murilo

358
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:39,173
- is not to blame.
- Actually, there's no wrong or right,

359
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:43,970
- everybody is over there, man.
- Everybody is free.

360
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:47,390
That chick over there...
Has nothing to do with this.

361
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:51,769
- If I were her, I'd be filing my nails.
- In my experience, I think they'll talk

362
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:55,314
when they're sober,
they're gonna apologize and all...

363
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,776
Apologize for what?

364
00:21:59,068 --> 00:22:03,823
Apologize for that situation, you know?
You know that drunk talk...

365
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:08,119
And she realized what happened.
"Fuck, I brought the boy here, kissed him.

366
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:11,122
"Then got in the room and saw Murilo
with another girl.

367
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:16,669
-"What will happen to us?"
- I don't understand this.

368
00:22:16,794 --> 00:22:21,007
No, I wonder if they'll remain friends
or if they'll say,

369
00:22:21,007 --> 00:22:25,136
"We realized it was bad
seeing ourselves with other people."

370
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:28,222
I think there's gonna be some trouble
after what she said.

371
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:30,600
But there's gonna be a talk.

372
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,312
- I think there's gonna be a bad mood.
- They'll say,

373
00:22:34,437 --> 00:22:38,399
"We realized we should be together."

374
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:43,154
I think she thinks he did that
on purpose to hurt her.

375
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:47,241
I'm gonna interrupt you guys because
I wanna watch the next episode's scenes.

376
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:49,202
And I'm gonna play it now.

377
00:22:49,577 --> 00:22:52,538
I don't have to go in my bedroom
and see them having sex.

378
00:22:52,538 --> 00:22:54,165
Now everybody is free.

379
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:55,708
IN THE NEXT EPISODE

380
00:22:55,708 --> 00:23:00,922
Because she said, "It's her, for sure,
the second pair of eyes never hurts."

381
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:03,633
I think it's intriguing
to have sex on the board.

382
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:07,470
No, guys, really? I wonder if something
happened on that board.

383
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:10,306
It's hard to keep your balance
on a stand-up board.
