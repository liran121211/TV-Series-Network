1
00:00:06,882 --> 00:00:08,426
There's more fighting today!

2
00:00:08,592 --> 00:00:10,052
There's hooking up!

3
00:00:12,138 --> 00:00:13,139
Oh, my God!

4
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:16,058
My week went by slowly.
I prayed for today.

5
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:17,685
Oh, my. Me, too.

6
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:18,936
There'll be fighting.

7
00:00:19,145 --> 00:00:20,396
Lots of things!

8
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:23,441
Things will happen. Murilo, Tay, Bia,

9
00:00:23,566 --> 00:00:26,277
Luan, who rubbed it
on somebody's knee.

10
00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:28,696
Who had her knee rubbed up to.

11
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,990
I don't wanna see it.

12
00:00:31,157 --> 00:00:32,992
We don't know it for sure.

13
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:34,994
Oh, my God, I'm anxious.

14
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:37,955
I'm anxious, because last episode
left me like this,

15
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:40,374
very sensitive, something like...

16
00:00:41,125 --> 00:00:43,085
I wanna see it right now.

17
00:00:43,294 --> 00:00:46,756
Are you all right now?
I'm still catching my breath.

18
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:49,633
Looks like the truck's still here,
it hit me.

19
00:00:49,884 --> 00:00:52,845
Murilo tried
to get back together with Tay,

20
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:55,306
but it must be hard seeing

21
00:00:55,556 --> 00:00:56,932
her boy with another girl.

22
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:59,685
She's adamant.
That's what's bothering him.

23
00:00:59,935 --> 00:01:04,148
But they're classy, they're not arguing.

24
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,650
There was that disagreement last week,

25
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:10,446
but she knows how to avoid this,
and he has nothing to say.

26
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:13,699
I'm anxious to know about Luan and Murilo.

27
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,326
That's the problem.

28
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:17,453
That scene over there, at the end,

29
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:21,832
- made me feel...
- And Bia was in it too, right?

30
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:25,002
Poor girl, she was kinda lost.
Too much booze.

31
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:27,963
And you saw that
Bia believed Luan too, right?

32
00:01:28,881 --> 00:01:32,009
So, she thinks Murilo rubbed it...

33
00:01:32,218 --> 00:01:33,636
into her knee.

34
00:01:33,844 --> 00:01:35,846
- These glasses are... for COVID?
- Yes.

35
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:37,848
Holy shit, bro.

36
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:41,268
- I'm pretty with these glasses.
- She's mocking us.

37
00:01:41,268 --> 00:01:43,729
I liked them and decided to wear them.

38
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:46,190
You're right. That's the power.

39
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,068
Guys, I wanna watch this episode.

40
00:01:49,568 --> 00:01:51,654
I'm gonna take the glasses off.

41
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:54,782
Hit play. Let me see here. Let's go.

42
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:27,273
WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS 2

43
00:02:40,744 --> 00:02:42,246
Is it gonna be only me?

44
00:02:42,454 --> 00:02:45,833
You had sex with a girl. Easy.
I heard her moaning.

45
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:48,377
I'm still hurt because of that.

46
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:50,713
If you knew how much I'm hurt.

47
00:02:50,963 --> 00:02:53,173
- Kissing is no big deal.
- That's it.

48
00:02:53,674 --> 00:02:55,593
I'm fine now.

49
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,804
I know what I do and what I don't, bro...

50
00:02:59,305 --> 00:03:01,015
It's not taking me anywhere.

51
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:02,808
It'll make me feel worse.

52
00:03:02,933 --> 00:03:04,560
But that really hurt me.

53
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:07,646
In a way I didn't think I'd feel.

54
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:11,233
It's good I found out
I really have feelings.

55
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:14,820
Tay, you're playing with me, man.

56
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:16,488
You're playing with me.

57
00:03:16,655 --> 00:03:18,574
No, I play with my feelings.

58
00:03:18,574 --> 00:03:21,201
- You're playing with me.
- I play with me.

59
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,870
I play with me, Murilo.

60
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:25,331
- You're playing with me.
- No, with me.

61
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:26,916
- No.
- With me.

62
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,834
No, because it's not just you!

63
00:03:29,001 --> 00:03:31,170
You're not alone in this.

64
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,297
But why would I be messing with you?

65
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:36,592
- Why would I be messing with you?
- I fucking love you.

66
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:39,845
- I love you too.
- You don't because...

67
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:41,347
You don't.

68
00:03:41,472 --> 00:03:44,350
I do. If I didn't, I'd be in the pool.

69
00:03:44,808 --> 00:03:46,560
I don't believe that.

70
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,242
Fuck, what a night!

71
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:10,709
What's up, brother? How are you? Okay?

72
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:15,422
I'm at home, having a good time,
and I was thinking about you.

73
00:04:16,048 --> 00:04:17,508
Things are crazy.

74
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:20,928
I wish you were here to party with us.

75
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:25,015
Floripa is not the same
without you to party with me.

76
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,642
I miss you...

77
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,435
I miss our parties in Rio.

78
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,646
Just want you to know...

79
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,273
that you're missed.

80
00:04:33,565 --> 00:04:35,567
- Who is it?
- My brother from Rio.

81
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:38,487
I was over there making up for lost time

82
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:39,989
and I texted.

83
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,616
- Renan?
- That's right.

84
00:04:42,908 --> 00:04:44,076
That's my boy.

85
00:04:44,576 --> 00:04:48,664
Fuck, man! I had to text him
this pool is beautiful, man.

86
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,208
Let me take this.

87
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:54,503
Take it... I'm gonna get the towel.
Take this.

88
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:01,051
Let me see our pictures.

89
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,680
This was the whipped cream...

90
00:05:05,097 --> 00:05:07,516
You and Anna are very funny.

91
00:05:07,933 --> 00:05:08,892
That's us.

92
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,855
What about this one?

93
00:05:13,063 --> 00:05:14,982
There were more pictures of you.

94
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:16,817
We took one that was... Look.

95
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:18,402
This.

96
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,945
Come here.

97
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:25,951
Where's the camera?

98
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,828
- It's over there.
- Is there film?

99
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,080
I'll use it well.

100
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:47,347
It's coming out.

101
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:49,308
- Let's take it.
- Let's go upstairs.

102
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,559
Let's do it.

103
00:06:41,777 --> 00:06:44,279
DON'T BE AN ASSHOLE

104
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:49,326
Later!

105
00:06:50,369 --> 00:06:51,453
Bye.

106
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,965
Look, a car's coming. It's a cab!

107
00:07:04,716 --> 00:07:06,051
Oh, my God!

108
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:09,638
- Look at her hair!
- Let me see it!

109
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:11,473
Let me see!

110
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:13,142
Oh, I'm scared.

111
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:14,726
Hey, Father Blond.

112
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:16,895
Bullshit!

113
00:07:17,062 --> 00:07:18,313
Come, bitch!

114
00:07:18,522 --> 00:07:19,898
Come, bitch!

115
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:21,441
Hey!

116
00:07:24,695 --> 00:07:26,864
- What's up?
- Welcome.

117
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:28,615
At lunchtime, man.

118
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,537
Let me introduce you to Tay.

119
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,414
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

120
00:07:35,622 --> 00:07:37,875
- How are you?
- You're pretty. What's going on?

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,961
- How are you?
- He is stylish, look at the eyebrow.

122
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,630
- Where's that thug?
- The eyebrow.

123
00:07:43,881 --> 00:07:45,048
Go there. Already?

124
00:07:45,215 --> 00:07:47,634
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

125
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:50,345
- Have I talked to everybody?
- Welcome to our world.

126
00:07:50,512 --> 00:07:52,890
You wanna introduce the shower, Anna?

127
00:07:53,182 --> 00:07:55,058
Come on!

128
00:07:55,434 --> 00:07:57,019
Hey, isn't Anna missing?

129
00:07:57,311 --> 00:07:58,437
Leave me alone.

130
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:02,524
You're the real life rabbit I know.
This one is the house bunny.

131
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:05,194
You have sex all day.

132
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,987
No, that's over.

133
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:08,906
It happened when I was 27.

134
00:08:09,072 --> 00:08:10,449
- How old are you?
- I'm 27.

135
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:16,038
Great!

136
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:21,877
It's over... So, now
I'm 27 years and one month old.

137
00:08:22,002 --> 00:08:23,837
I'm growing old.

138
00:08:24,338 --> 00:08:26,298
Were you in a relationship?

139
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:29,134
- That's right.
- I was with her everywhere.

140
00:08:29,134 --> 00:08:32,012
Then you'll be welcomed
to the bachelor's life.

141
00:08:33,222 --> 00:08:34,681
You'll be fine in Floripa.

142
00:08:35,432 --> 00:08:37,017
And drown your sorrows.

143
00:08:37,184 --> 00:08:38,393
When did you break up?

144
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:40,812
Did you break up to come here?

145
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,148
- Two days.
- Did you break up to come here?

146
00:08:43,315 --> 00:08:44,524
She broke up with me.

147
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:45,901
She knows you're here?

148
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:48,028
She broke up with me.

149
00:08:48,153 --> 00:08:50,113
How long were you together?

150
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:51,406
Eleven days.

151
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:53,325
Oh, fuck!

152
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:56,119
I was thinking it was much more.

153
00:08:57,204 --> 00:08:59,539
I wonder if you're an intense person.

154
00:08:59,957 --> 00:09:01,792
Feelings have to do with time?

155
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:04,419
No, that's okay, but...

156
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:07,005
- Do you want me to repeat?
- No.

157
00:09:07,005 --> 00:09:08,966
- Jeez, girl.
- Nathália, right?

158
00:09:09,216 --> 00:09:10,926
Look into my eyes.

159
00:09:11,134 --> 00:09:14,263
Do feelings have anything to do
with time or intensity?

160
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,974
- Intensity.
- I rest my case.

161
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,142
What are we gonna do today?

162
00:09:19,685 --> 00:09:22,020
Today, there's that rock party

163
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:25,065
here in Flo...
At the lagoon. It's a party.

164
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:26,441
Rock party?

165
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:29,027
We're gonna rock tonight.

166
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:33,490
But is it rock music?

167
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:35,158
It's not rock music.

168
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:39,246
- It's a party.
- Oh, rock music. Okay. It's just...

169
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:41,540
We got the invitation to attend today.

170
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:43,542
That's the best way, kid.

171
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,761
I'm gonna get you the shorts.

172
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:55,679
Sure.

173
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:02,519
Anna!

174
00:10:02,686 --> 00:10:04,521
Yes!

175
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:08,025
Come here quickly
so that I can tell you something.

176
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,237
Come here quickly, Anna.

177
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:14,489
I'm gonna tell you something.

178
00:10:15,657 --> 00:10:16,950
Anna, if I go there...

179
00:10:19,328 --> 00:10:20,620
Tell me.

180
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,624
He's calling you.

181
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,294
When you are ready,
come here so I can see you

182
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,503
to decide my clothes.

183
00:10:29,087 --> 00:10:30,297
Got it?

184
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:33,216
I stopped here to dress up.

185
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,151
You have too much makeup on.

186
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,278
That's how you talk to me?

187
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:55,280
Bro, this is not necessary, right?

188
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,532
I prefer your face.

189
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:02,329
How?

190
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,917
- I have too much makeup on, is that it?
- Yes.

191
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:32,192
I thought you were hot.

192
00:11:32,484 --> 00:11:34,277
I was sure.

193
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:46,706
Hey, look who's coming over there!

194
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:52,629
Let's go!

195
00:11:52,796 --> 00:11:55,215
Hey, Renan, get in the bus, please.

196
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:58,468
Renan is the first one to get in the bus.

197
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:03,849
Go, kid! Did you warm up, fool?

198
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:08,103
Let's go!

199
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:09,312
Go.

200
00:12:10,772 --> 00:12:12,065
Girl, you don't...

201
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:14,568
- Hey, man, awesome.
- That's great.

202
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:24,411
KEEP GOING

203
00:12:34,713 --> 00:12:37,090
So, guys, our moments
will be forever ours...

204
00:12:37,299 --> 00:12:39,050
And will be never theirs.

205
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:42,387
Never theirs.

206
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:46,725
One for all, all for one!
One for all, all for one!

207
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:58,111
What's up, princess?

208
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,948
What's up, my man?

209
00:13:03,241 --> 00:13:04,201
You can take it.

210
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,703
Bia, dirty stuff!

211
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,981
Idiot, I just kiss.

212
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:00,715
What did you think of Renan?

213
00:14:00,966 --> 00:14:03,635
At first, you didn't want to,

214
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,346
now you get out of the bus holding hands.

215
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,932
I'm hard to get... He moves his hand fast.

216
00:14:09,224 --> 00:14:11,685
When I realized, we were holding hands.

217
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:13,395
He's gentle, right?

218
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,397
It's hot, right?

219
00:14:15,647 --> 00:14:16,898
At first...

220
00:14:17,399 --> 00:14:19,568
I didn't know.

221
00:14:20,277 --> 00:14:23,405
Then I felt like hooking up with him.

222
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:25,824
Then he stayed there looking at me.

223
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:27,826
Playing hard to get.

224
00:14:28,118 --> 00:14:30,036
I think he wants to marry me.

225
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:34,541
He watched me getting ready,
then we kissed. Girl, he's a good kisser.

226
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,043
He's kinda cute.
But take it easy, you know?

227
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:40,255
You were crying and screaming,
"I want a boy!"

228
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,549
At least I kissed.

229
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:44,384
What about you and Murilo?

230
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:46,678
I don't know if that's gonna work out.

231
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:48,805
I'm really trying.

232
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,725
"Let's go." I'm gonna give him
a second chance.

233
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:54,769
But sixty percent of me

234
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:57,188
doesn't want it anymore, you know?

235
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:59,482
I don't stop thinking about it.

236
00:14:59,816 --> 00:15:02,736
I don't think that's why, girl.
That was the question.

237
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:05,655
You weren't very comfortable.

238
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:08,283
There were things... That was, like...

239
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:10,702
That was the last straw.

240
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:15,290
I think you wanted a good reason
to say, "See? We can't."

241
00:15:15,999 --> 00:15:18,752
You wanted a reason.

242
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,921
And he gave that to me, right? The reason.

243
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,326
Bro, you're awesome.

244
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:54,704
Bro, you're... You're awesome.

245
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:59,084
- That's why I'm quiet.
- Bro, "awesome".

246
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:00,919
This is the word I have for you.

247
00:16:01,169 --> 00:16:02,671
But I'm out.

248
00:16:02,671 --> 00:16:05,131
I know, that's why I'm quiet.

249
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,758
I know.

250
00:16:06,883 --> 00:16:08,134
You are...

251
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,428
I'm gonna go with Bia.

252
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,725
Ramon's friend has lost his mind.

253
00:16:17,018 --> 00:16:19,187
"You were my first option."

254
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,523
Hey, not her! Not her.

255
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:26,569
No, but no kissing.

256
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:31,157
You're tripping!
No, she's talking about... It's just you!

257
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:35,453
"I'm gonna tell you it's a difficult
situation because I want you so bad."

258
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:39,082
Get a grip!

259
00:16:43,795 --> 00:16:45,255
I'm gonna kiss her.

260
00:16:45,422 --> 00:16:48,216
She's drunk. I'm gonna kiss you instead.

261
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,392
I'm gonna kiss her!

262
00:16:57,392 --> 00:17:00,019
Fuck, she's talking about something else!

263
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,939
You're paranoid and you're tripping!

264
00:17:03,148 --> 00:17:04,190
I'm not.

265
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:08,027
Now you're tripping...
So, get a grip. Okay?

266
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:09,863
Shut up, you're tripping,

267
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:12,157
you're full of shit.

268
00:17:12,157 --> 00:17:13,825
So, get a grip.

269
00:17:24,878 --> 00:17:26,045
This is very weird.

270
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,968
Fucking weird.

271
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,470
Fucking weird.

272
00:17:33,636 --> 00:17:35,096
Fucking weird.

273
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,350
That look on your face, I can't...

274
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:43,271
Dude, Tay wants to get me jealous
because of the rookie, you know?

275
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:46,191
Can you believe that?

276
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,942
Renan?

277
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,069
Man, I don't know.

278
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:53,615
I didn't see it, bro.

279
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:55,617
- I swear to God.
- Really?

280
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:59,287
Bro, the talk is gonna...

281
00:17:59,454 --> 00:18:01,331
I don't believe this, man.

282
00:18:07,712 --> 00:18:09,130
What about you and Bia?

283
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,966
Tay hit on Bia.

284
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:15,386
But, bro, Tay hit on Bia.

285
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:18,181
She tried to kiss her,
I said, "Bro, are you crazy?"

286
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,058
She's trying everything.

287
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:22,393
I said, "Bro, are you crazy?"

288
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:23,686
Everything.

289
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:26,648
She's stuck to Ramonzinho...

290
00:18:26,815 --> 00:18:29,943
- And I don't know...
- I said, "What the fuck is this?"

291
00:18:30,068 --> 00:18:33,029
"Oh, it's nothing." Go fuck herself!

292
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:35,615
"It's nothing", my ass. Show some respect.

293
00:18:35,824 --> 00:18:37,867
We are brothers, we help each other!

294
00:18:38,034 --> 00:18:39,911
Beatriz is very simple.

295
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:42,664
She doesn't imagine things, bro.

296
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:44,999
Bia is a good person.

297
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:48,878
- But Tay was kissing the neck...
- Tay is mischievous.

298
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:50,380
Tay is mischievous.

299
00:18:50,588 --> 00:18:52,298
Fuck, I won't be mean, bro.

300
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:54,008
I won't be mean.

301
00:18:54,217 --> 00:18:56,302
Tay was kissing Bia's neck, bro.

302
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,429
Go fuck herself.

303
00:18:58,847 --> 00:19:00,431
Go fuck herself.

304
00:19:00,807 --> 00:19:03,268
Bro, that was it, seriously,
I tried and all...

305
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:04,936
I tried...

306
00:19:05,228 --> 00:19:06,855
All the time, I was quiet,

307
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,356
but dude,

308
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:11,234
I can't anymore.

309
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:31,838
Let's go!

310
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:34,674
Hey! Let's go, let's bounce.

311
00:19:47,478 --> 00:19:48,897
You saw it!

312
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:51,190
She's my friend.

313
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,317
You saw it!

314
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:53,526
She's my friend.

315
00:19:53,693 --> 00:19:55,612
Guys, everybody is wasted,

316
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,447
no reason to argue now.

317
00:19:57,947 --> 00:20:01,034
There's no reason, got it?

318
00:20:01,326 --> 00:20:03,786
She grabbed Beatriz, bro. Who am I?

319
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:06,915
- Man, you're tripping, man!
- We're friends, Luan.

320
00:20:07,081 --> 00:20:09,250
- For God's sake!
- You're friends?

321
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,003
- Jeez, girl.
- I'm gonna kiss her then.

322
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,213
Oh, it's not allowed!

323
00:20:14,339 --> 00:20:16,341
- It's not allowed!
- Kiss Murilo.

324
00:20:16,466 --> 00:20:17,926
"Kiss Murilo?"

325
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:19,594
"Kiss Murilo..." What?

326
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:21,346
No, girl, forget it.

327
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:23,014
She tried to grab you.

328
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:25,808
No, you're tripping!

329
00:20:26,017 --> 00:20:28,895
- You're tripping!
- I was hoping you...

330
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,148
My friend over there
is getting things off her chest.

331
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:35,109
Do you think she wants to fuck me?

332
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:36,527
Speak Portuguese.

333
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,529
I'm speaking Portuguese.

334
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:41,074
If you're starting to think...

335
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:42,742
Speak Portuguese.

336
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:44,744
Hey, Luan. Stop.

337
00:20:44,953 --> 00:20:47,789
Hey, you're making a scene. You're stoned.

338
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:52,126
Luan, I only think about
Murilo having sex with a girl,

339
00:20:52,377 --> 00:20:55,088
- I'll never forget this!
- Girl!

340
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:58,132
My heart hurts.

341
00:20:58,383 --> 00:21:00,635
Girl, come here, look at me.

342
00:21:00,885 --> 00:21:04,222
- No, forget this.
- He had sex with a girl.

343
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:08,893
I tried to get over it,
but my heart is in pain.

344
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:11,354
Taynara! Stop!

345
00:21:11,562 --> 00:21:14,023
Taynara! Stop!

346
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:16,234
Taynara! Stop!

347
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,903
Look at me! This is bullshit!

348
00:21:19,028 --> 00:21:21,155
I didn't do anything, man.

349
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,118
I didn't do anything.
I'm gonna mind my own business.

350
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:40,967
I'm shocked.

351
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:43,803
Man, Tay lost her argument
because of that.

352
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:47,515
I told you, she was very classy all the...

353
00:21:47,765 --> 00:21:50,184
- In the previous days.
- But, booze is to blame.

354
00:21:50,351 --> 00:21:52,854
- That's because of the booze.
- Booze, love.

355
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:53,938
I don't drink.

356
00:21:54,105 --> 00:21:57,400
I think booze just helps you
do the stuff you wanna do.

357
00:21:57,525 --> 00:21:59,777
Booze makes you feel comfortable.

358
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:02,363
Whatever you're feeling.

359
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:05,116
Imagine what she's been through
in that house,

360
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:07,410
repressing her feelings.

361
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:12,248
But I think she had no reason to do
that to him, he didn't do anything.

362
00:22:12,457 --> 00:22:16,627
That's crazy, Tay coming at Murilo.

363
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:19,505
At least she missed that kick,

364
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:24,469
- that's something good.
- Guys, he's not wrong.

365
00:22:24,594 --> 00:22:27,388
She's wrong, but not because of Murilo,
because of Anna.

366
00:22:27,680 --> 00:22:29,057
That's complicated.

367
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:33,978
Bia forgave Luan when he apologized,
and she was very cool about it.

368
00:22:34,187 --> 00:22:35,897
She was very cool about it.

369
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:39,484
Luan was the one who couldn't forget it,
he's very insecure.

370
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:43,571
But Tay decided to forgive Murilo
and she doesn't let it go,

371
00:22:43,738 --> 00:22:46,908
she teases him all the time.

372
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:49,243
She lost it when she kicked him.

373
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:52,538
Now Luan is making no sense, really.

374
00:22:52,747 --> 00:22:56,667
He's setting the friend of the girl
he's hooking up with against her...

375
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:59,003
Like, he created a fanfic.

376
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:00,922
I guess, seriously,

377
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:04,842
I guess he's thinking about breaking up.

378
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:09,097
He wants to be free.

379
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:12,475
I think he wants to be free
and he's making excuses...

380
00:23:12,934 --> 00:23:17,146
- Making excuses to be rid of that.
- Exactly.

381
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:21,317
I got it, but it goes against
what he said, his apologies...

382
00:23:21,484 --> 00:23:23,361
saying he wants to...

383
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:27,573
He wants to do whatever he wants,
but he doesn't want to lose her.

384
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:29,909
- Exactly.
- Then he makes excuses...

385
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:33,621
- creating situations...
- It looks like, I don't know,

386
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:36,541
there's a gap, because

387
00:23:36,749 --> 00:23:41,712
- I don't get anything.
- There was a lot of misunderstanding...

388
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:45,424
- A lot.
- Let's see what...

389
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,260
- I'm curious.
- Please!

390
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:48,678
Play.

391
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:01,792
I'm gonna make my cigarette and smoke.

392
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:04,086
Because, bro, life is wonderful.

393
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:06,088
You know, bro? Life is wonderful.

394
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:10,092
- Jeez, what a scene.
- Guys, that made no sense.

395
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:12,136
I was completely lost.

396
00:25:20,144 --> 00:25:22,605
That boy was seated, I was asleep.

397
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:25,107
Out of the blue, she started to...

398
00:25:25,399 --> 00:25:28,110
Out of the blue,
she started to cry, to talk about...

399
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:31,155
They weren't in a relationship.

400
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,700
Get it off your chest, cry,

401
00:25:34,951 --> 00:25:36,994
let it go.

402
00:25:38,621 --> 00:25:40,373
Girl, I wouldn't wish this

403
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:44,043
on my worst enemy. I swear to God.

404
00:25:44,252 --> 00:25:45,920
Seeing somebody you like

405
00:25:46,128 --> 00:25:50,299
- having sex with other...
- Girl, it hurts a lot!

406
00:25:50,508 --> 00:25:52,802
It's been two days, I'm trying.

407
00:25:54,345 --> 00:25:56,389
But tonight was the last straw.

408
00:25:57,598 --> 00:25:59,016
It hurts!

409
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:03,896
It seems like every time I lay down,
I see that scene, girl.

410
00:26:06,774 --> 00:26:08,943
You're an older man.

411
00:26:09,402 --> 00:26:11,904
Smoke and tomorrow you talk to her.

412
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,656
Bro, we've talked...

413
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:16,742
- No, take it easy...
- We've already talked.

414
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:19,704
He talked to her when they were sober.

415
00:26:19,954 --> 00:26:23,541
She's stoned,
she wants to play hard to get.

416
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:27,169
- Bro, I'm very calm.
- Look at me!

417
00:26:28,004 --> 00:26:29,964
There's no way.

418
00:26:30,548 --> 00:26:32,300
It's not worth it.

419
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:37,013
Bro, Murilo is different, I said...
The same thing I told you, I said,

420
00:26:37,263 --> 00:26:39,348
"Fuck, bro, Murilo looks like me."

421
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:41,434
Why did she have that crisis?

422
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:51,360
I just ask... like...

423
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:53,362
From the bottom of my heart.

424
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:55,364
I didn't do anything.

425
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:57,616
Put yourself in her shoes.

426
00:26:57,825 --> 00:27:01,412
- Go there, go talk to Luan. I'm done...
- No, damn. That's it.

427
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,832
I'm done, I've already fucking said it!

428
00:27:05,207 --> 00:27:07,168
I've already put myself in her shoes.

429
00:27:07,293 --> 00:27:11,005
It's over. There's no reason
she insists... There's no reason, bro.

430
00:27:11,005 --> 00:27:15,301
It's easy to say
that's water under the bridge,

431
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,887
but that stuff happened two days ago.

432
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:22,725
Bro, I've said what I think about it.
They both did what they wanted...

433
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:25,978
She forgave him, why is she rubbing it in?

434
00:27:26,103 --> 00:27:29,231
You know, bro? I never judged her.
I never said,

435
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,818
"You hooked up with that DJ."
You know? For fuck's sake!

436
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:34,653
Did she fuck anybody?

437
00:27:35,446 --> 00:27:39,700
She could have... Bro, if she wanted to,
she could have fucked, you know?

438
00:27:39,909 --> 00:27:42,453
But why didn't she fuck? She respects you.

439
00:27:42,453 --> 00:27:46,374
- Because she didn't want to.
- Bia, seriously...

440
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:50,795
Seriously, that's your opinion.
And, Bia, I respect it. I respect it.

441
00:27:50,961 --> 00:27:51,962
Give me a hug.

442
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:54,632
- I respect your opinion.
- I respect yours.

443
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:57,802
That's it, it's over.
You judged me, unfortunately.

444
00:27:58,010 --> 00:27:59,261
I judged you?

445
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:02,056
- That's okay, Bia.
- I judged you?

446
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,645
I've just exposed the facts.

447
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,647
That's it.

448
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:17,363
Judging somebody... Guys, I don't judge.

449
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:19,615
Who am I?

450
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:27,164
Baby, why are you here?

451
00:28:27,498 --> 00:28:30,543
- Why are you here?
- This is not gonna happen.

452
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:34,171
What's wrong?

453
00:28:38,843 --> 00:28:40,177
What is it?

454
00:28:41,554 --> 00:28:43,013
What is it?

455
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:46,851
Yeah, please, excuse me?

456
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:48,686
Can you excuse me?

457
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,813
But what happen...

458
00:28:52,356 --> 00:28:54,525
Can you excuse me?

459
00:28:56,944 --> 00:28:58,612
Why are you being rude?

460
00:29:00,364 --> 00:29:01,615
I don't understand.

461
00:29:01,907 --> 00:29:04,410
There's no "you and me" anymore,
it's over.

462
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,955
- What do you mean?
- Bro, that's right.

463
00:29:08,289 --> 00:29:10,332
There's no more "you and me".

464
00:29:11,208 --> 00:29:13,669
Okay? Go have fun.

465
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:16,338
- Why are you saying this?
- Bunch of idiots.

466
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:21,051
Leave me alone, bro. I'm silent.

467
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:23,304
Can you do this?

468
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:25,347
You saint.

469
00:29:35,483 --> 00:29:36,692
No, I'm mad!

470
00:29:36,901 --> 00:29:38,152
Fuck you, everybody.

471
00:29:38,444 --> 00:29:41,071
- Not me.
- Not you, because you're my buddy.

472
00:29:41,572 --> 00:29:45,034
But you go fuck yourself,
Tay, Bia, Luan too...

473
00:29:45,201 --> 00:29:48,120
- I did nothing.
- I know, but go fuck yourselves.

474
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:49,872
I did the least, right?

475
00:29:50,164 --> 00:29:51,415
I didn't do anything.

476
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:53,417
You guys made me get sober.

477
00:29:53,834 --> 00:29:55,252
Don't do this, girl.

478
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:56,754
Why is he pissed?

479
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:59,423
- Why are you pissed?
- What did I do?

480
00:29:59,590 --> 00:30:00,758
You were born...

481
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,676
I was born! Hi!

482
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,803
Amen, thanks!

483
00:30:05,346 --> 00:30:07,848
Why are you pissed at Bia, Murilo?

484
00:30:08,057 --> 00:30:09,975
Bia, am I pissed at you?

485
00:30:10,768 --> 00:30:12,228
No!

486
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,734
I'm not fucking following...

487
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:22,238
I took care of that girl
when she was wasted.

488
00:30:22,404 --> 00:30:24,573
You're all crazy.

489
00:30:24,865 --> 00:30:26,408
Fuck!

490
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:29,203
That's it, fucking shit!

491
00:31:40,566 --> 00:31:41,859
Why are you there?

492
00:31:46,363 --> 00:31:47,531
What did I do?

493
00:31:47,865 --> 00:31:49,366
- Explain it to me.
- Nothing.

494
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:51,327
Nothing, you're a saint.

495
00:31:51,452 --> 00:31:53,954
- You're a saint.
- I really am. Thank God!

496
00:31:54,204 --> 00:31:55,205
Amen!

497
00:31:55,623 --> 00:31:57,041
What did I do to you?

498
00:31:57,207 --> 00:32:00,377
Can you take your hand off me?

499
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:04,006
What did I do to you?

500
00:32:04,590 --> 00:32:06,008
What did I do to you?

501
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:07,843
What did I do?

502
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,721
Nothing, you're a saint!

503
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:13,265
- You're a saint.
- I didn't understand.

504
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:14,808
I really am, amen!

505
00:32:15,309 --> 00:32:18,729
Can you explain what happened?

506
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:24,068
Why are you sleeping here?

507
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:29,573
We'll sleep together.

508
00:32:31,659 --> 00:32:33,869
Can you take the hand off?

509
00:32:37,081 --> 00:32:38,457
Don't do this.

510
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:41,377
- Don't do this.
- Don't do what?

511
00:32:42,378 --> 00:32:45,255
Don't do what?

512
00:32:45,714 --> 00:32:47,049
Don't do what?

513
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:49,343
Don't do what?

514
00:32:49,677 --> 00:32:51,595
Beatriz, go fuck yourself!

515
00:32:51,887 --> 00:32:54,223
You go fuck yourself, man!

516
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:57,142
Fuck, what a wacko!

517
00:32:57,351 --> 00:32:58,644
Fuck you.

518
00:32:59,853 --> 00:33:02,481
Fuck you. Never mind.

519
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:05,234
He's asking for it.

520
00:33:06,568 --> 00:33:08,112
What's this?

521
00:33:08,237 --> 00:33:11,198
What's this?

522
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,158
You wanna kill me?

523
00:33:13,409 --> 00:33:15,744
Do you know what this is?

524
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,621
Bia, don't tease now.

525
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:20,791
What was that for, man?

526
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:23,961
Lock her in the bathroom.

527
00:33:24,253 --> 00:33:25,212
We're together.

528
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:29,299
I'll never let you mess up.

529
00:33:29,466 --> 00:33:31,927
But, man, she teased me this way...

530
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:33,512
- I know, bro.
- I was asleep.

531
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:36,348
I was asleep, bro.

532
00:33:36,557 --> 00:33:38,934
- I was asleep.
- I don't understand.

533
00:33:39,351 --> 00:33:40,978
I won't let you mess up.

534
00:33:41,478 --> 00:33:42,604
We're bros.

535
00:33:44,356 --> 00:33:46,984
Relax, man.

536
00:33:47,651 --> 00:33:48,902
Relax, man.

537
00:33:49,653 --> 00:33:51,864
We're bros, relax.

538
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:53,490
Count on me.

539
00:33:54,491 --> 00:33:55,659
That's it.

540
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:57,911
Relax, dude.

541
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:01,874
Hold Bia. Aren't you afraid
of getting your ass kicked?

542
00:34:02,291 --> 00:34:03,751
He's not crazy.

543
00:34:03,917 --> 00:34:05,335
Cry if you want to, bro.

544
00:34:06,295 --> 00:34:07,629
You know?

545
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:09,631
Cry if you want to, bro.

546
00:34:10,007 --> 00:34:11,884
What's going on, bro?

547
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:14,052
I don't even know what's going on.

548
00:34:14,511 --> 00:34:16,180
I didn't understand anything.

549
00:34:16,388 --> 00:34:17,556
You know?

550
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:19,808
Nothing, bro.

551
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,685
I didn't understand anything.

552
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:24,772
- Where's Ramon?
- I don't know.

553
00:34:26,607 --> 00:34:28,150
Okay, I'm cool.

554
00:34:28,942 --> 00:34:30,360
Chill. Let her talk.

555
00:34:30,861 --> 00:34:32,446
Please, let her talk.

556
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,741
Chill.

557
00:34:35,866 --> 00:34:38,243
Obviously. She's a whore.

558
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:40,120
Chill, bro.

559
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:41,747
I just wanna sleep.

560
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:44,917
- I was asleep, bro.
- Did I do anything?

561
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:47,753
- I'm with you.
- Did I do anything?

562
00:34:47,961 --> 00:34:49,713
Where's Ramon?

563
00:34:50,214 --> 00:34:52,591
Guys, did I do anything?

564
00:34:53,008 --> 00:34:56,220
Girl, I did absolutely nothing.

565
00:34:56,512 --> 00:34:57,346
Gosh!

566
00:34:57,471 --> 00:35:01,391
Bro, I don't give a shit
about what you do or don't!

567
00:35:02,267 --> 00:35:04,061
What do you think I was doing?

568
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:08,398
I didn't say anything about this.
You were sleeping to me.

569
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,776
What do you think I was doing?

570
00:35:11,985 --> 00:35:14,029
No, you're always a saint, right?

571
00:35:14,488 --> 00:35:17,616
Hey, Luan, let's get some sleep,
you're tripping.

572
00:35:17,783 --> 00:35:21,745
- Let me hug her.
- Go get some sleep, no!

573
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:25,666
For God's sake, Luan!
Are you gonna hit me, bro?

574
00:35:25,874 --> 00:35:29,419
Are you gonna hit me? You can hit me.

575
00:35:29,586 --> 00:35:31,380
You can hit me.

576
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:35,592
What's this... Bro!

577
00:35:35,843 --> 00:35:39,263
Excuse me. Don't you do this to her!

578
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:40,639
Murilo,

579
00:35:40,806 --> 00:35:42,766
can you take your hand off me?

580
00:35:42,933 --> 00:35:44,560
I was washing...

581
00:35:45,686 --> 00:35:47,563
I won't let you go.

582
00:35:47,771 --> 00:35:50,649
You can punch me, I won't let you go.

583
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:52,734
What's this? Don't do this!

584
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:54,528
What's up, bro?

585
00:35:54,528 --> 00:35:56,655
You hit me with your elbow. Fuck!

586
00:35:56,905 --> 00:35:58,490
Get a fucking grip!

587
00:35:58,699 --> 00:36:01,243
Nobody did nothing, Luan!

588
00:36:01,451 --> 00:36:03,161
Seriously.

589
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,958
Stop it! Go.

590
00:36:08,125 --> 00:36:09,251
Everybody, bro.

591
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:11,712
Bia, look at this, Bia.

592
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,673
- Mu, gargle it.

593
00:36:15,007 --> 00:36:17,759
- Bia. I just held him.
- I saw it.

594
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:19,595
He hit me with his elbow.

595
00:36:20,304 --> 00:36:22,139
He fucked up my mouth.

596
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:05,307
ASSHOLE

597
00:37:09,269 --> 00:37:11,104
There's gonna be a fight.

598
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:21,865
Okay, here we go.

599
00:37:22,032 --> 00:37:24,409
Do you wanna talk about what happened?

600
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:27,120
I have to apologize to everybody.

601
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:28,497
But what did you do?

602
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:31,083
- If you're crazy...
- I was hurting.

603
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,168
But hurting is...

604
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:36,880
- Yeah, it was repressed...
- That's what I say...

605
00:37:37,047 --> 00:37:40,425
- get it off your chest at that moment.
- I can't.

606
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:43,929
I told this to Nath yesterday,

607
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:45,847
"Stop repressing your feelings."

608
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:48,976
So, I didn't get why everybody fought.

609
00:37:49,393 --> 00:37:50,644
I didn't get this.

610
00:37:50,644 --> 00:37:53,105
I didn't fight because I don't do it.

611
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:55,565
Everybody was on a different bed.

612
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:57,359
I don't understand why...

613
00:37:57,567 --> 00:37:59,945
Anna hasn't slept with me yet,
but that's okay.

614
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:02,531
- Poor girl...
- She'll pay for this. "Poor girl?"

615
00:38:02,864 --> 00:38:05,450
About the situation, you know?

616
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:08,954
- You could love each other.
- I went upstairs...

617
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:10,539
I was wasted, obviously.

618
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:12,124
I said, bro...

619
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,085
- I think she wasn't in the mood.
- I agree.

620
00:38:15,585 --> 00:38:16,628
What now?

621
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:19,589
About my life or the food?

622
00:38:22,217 --> 00:38:24,678
You're gonna mess with me.
Okay, I'll play.

623
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:28,181
My next move is minding my own business.

624
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:30,892
You fuck up and then keep cool.

625
00:38:31,518 --> 00:38:33,228
Stay quiet, at least for two days.

626
00:38:33,478 --> 00:38:35,105
Until I'm not embarrassed.

627
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:39,651
We have to get things off
our chest, but...

628
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,486
at the right moment.

629
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:43,780
It's easy.

630
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:45,490
How do I erase this?

631
00:38:45,824 --> 00:38:46,950
What?

632
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:48,869
Who did this?

633
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:51,329
- I don't know, it's messed up.
-"Asshole."

634
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:57,961
I hope it's my friends.

635
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,964
He made this "Don't be an asshole."

636
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:03,050
No, "Asshole." It's just this.

637
00:39:03,592 --> 00:39:05,427
- Can I write here?
- Sure.

638
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:07,345
- Whatever I want?
- Yes.

639
00:39:08,096 --> 00:39:09,139
Okay.

640
00:39:19,649 --> 00:39:21,693
Good morning, baby.

641
00:39:25,614 --> 00:39:26,907
It's awful.

642
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:29,117
"You learn by fucking things up."

643
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:31,661
You learn to live by fucking things up.

644
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:47,260
What would you do in my place?

645
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:51,431
I wouldn't have given a second chance.
I would have broken up the first time.

646
00:39:51,765 --> 00:39:53,100
First thing he did.

647
00:39:53,308 --> 00:39:56,394
The first time
he called me a bitch and all.

648
00:39:58,146 --> 00:39:59,481
You know why, guys?

649
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,316
This applies to Tay too.

650
00:40:01,775 --> 00:40:03,819
There's nothing without respect.

651
00:40:05,070 --> 00:40:05,987
Girl...

652
00:40:06,113 --> 00:40:09,658
with no respect, there's no way to fix it.

653
00:40:09,825 --> 00:40:12,369
First, there's respect, then trust, love.

654
00:40:12,702 --> 00:40:14,746
There's gotta be respect, guys.

655
00:40:15,539 --> 00:40:17,332
It's the foundation.

656
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:20,168
How are you gonna eat with no table?

657
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:24,756
- I think he had to...
- Guys, this is an abusive relationship.

658
00:40:24,965 --> 00:40:26,466
It is a lot.

659
00:40:27,092 --> 00:40:28,760
I told Bia, I've never seen

660
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:31,054
anybody so...

661
00:40:31,388 --> 00:40:33,348
And... I...

662
00:40:34,307 --> 00:40:36,726
I can't handle this.

663
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:38,270
It's like...

664
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:40,355
Yeah, girl, you're in it.

665
00:40:40,564 --> 00:40:42,149
You're involved...

666
00:40:42,524 --> 00:40:44,234
I've been there... Twice.

667
00:40:44,568 --> 00:40:45,735
It was really bad.

668
00:40:45,861 --> 00:40:48,238
It's hard to end this.

669
00:40:48,530 --> 00:40:51,575
You have to want it really bad.

670
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:54,536
When the anger's gone,

671
00:40:55,162 --> 00:40:57,956
when things are calm, you like the person,

672
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:02,711
and he says he loves you,
cries, says he's gonna change...

673
00:41:04,254 --> 00:41:05,839
You get back together.

674
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:08,884
The next party, the same old shit.

675
00:41:08,884 --> 00:41:09,843
Always!

676
00:41:10,218 --> 00:41:12,512
I lived this for six months...

677
00:41:12,762 --> 00:41:16,474
How many fights in four days?
There was that thing in the pool,

678
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,602
that other thing he said...

679
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:21,146
Luan makes things up to argue with her.

680
00:41:21,354 --> 00:41:22,397
Makes things up.

681
00:41:22,606 --> 00:41:26,234
She does nothing
and he makes something up!

682
00:41:26,443 --> 00:41:27,777
And nothing happened!

683
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:29,821
Now it's forbidden to bump?

684
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:31,198
Jesus Christ.

685
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:33,158
It's forbidden to bump.

686
00:41:33,658 --> 00:41:35,327
I don't want this anymore.

687
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:38,246
- I love him very much.
- The last straw was...

688
00:41:39,206 --> 00:41:40,290
I was in the bus.

689
00:41:40,540 --> 00:41:42,292
You saw it too.

690
00:41:42,918 --> 00:41:44,711
You went to help Tay.

691
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:47,172
She was crying, and you were helping...

692
00:41:47,631 --> 00:41:51,134
- He went there...
- He talks to her as if she was a dog.

693
00:41:51,301 --> 00:41:54,346
"Are you really
gonna stay there, Beatriz?"

694
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:59,434
-"Fuck, yeah, she's my friend!"
- I remember this.

695
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:01,478
"Kiss Murilo..." What?

696
00:42:02,103 --> 00:42:04,564
- I'm... I'm kissing...
- She tried to grab you.

697
00:42:04,773 --> 00:42:08,109
No, you're tripping!

698
00:42:08,276 --> 00:42:10,403
I thought you were my friend.

699
00:42:10,862 --> 00:42:12,989
I remember saying this to him.

700
00:42:13,198 --> 00:42:16,201
I remember, we were in the bathroom,
I was crying...

701
00:42:16,326 --> 00:42:19,454
- He got angry about that.
- And he went to the bathroom...

702
00:42:19,663 --> 00:42:21,331
You were helping her.

703
00:42:31,258 --> 00:42:33,426
Guys, what am I doing with my life?

704
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:38,139
If it wasn't for Murilo yesterday,
we'd be fucked.

705
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,559
I would've locked myself in the bathroom.

706
00:42:41,935 --> 00:42:43,186
I would've run.

707
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:47,232
I said, "Let's lock ourselves
in the bathroom?" They said, "No."

708
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:03,665
Look at my face.

709
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:38,658
I think we...

710
00:43:38,825 --> 00:43:41,202
You don't wanna talk...

711
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:42,954
I don't feel like it.

712
00:43:44,497 --> 00:43:45,957
I wanna be alone.

713
00:43:46,249 --> 00:43:48,501
I have to think about myself for once.

714
00:44:06,603 --> 00:44:09,022
Amazon Prime Video analyzed the footage

715
00:44:09,022 --> 00:44:11,107
and came to the conclusion

716
00:44:11,107 --> 00:44:13,985
that Luan could not remain in the show

717
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:15,570
after his attitude.

718
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:19,824
Hey, guys.

719
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:21,618
Sit down. Do it, bitch.

720
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:27,207
I made a terrible mistake.
I don't remember what I did, but I did.

721
00:44:28,375 --> 00:44:32,295
I don't even know if I wanna watch this
because this is not me. I'm very sorry.

722
00:44:32,587 --> 00:44:37,926
I'm gonna let you enjoy your vacation.
I'm gonna take care of myself.

723
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:39,886
Mu, we're bros!

724
00:44:40,053 --> 00:44:42,389
I don't wanna get in anybody's way.

725
00:44:42,806 --> 00:44:44,766
I'm very sorry.

726
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:49,562
I'm gonna pack and I'd like to hug
each one of you before I leave.

727
00:44:50,355 --> 00:44:53,691
I made a mistake, but I love you all.

728
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:56,569
I really thank you.

729
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:07,705
Fuck...

730
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:25,974
You can cry, bro. Be my guest. Cry!

731
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:29,269
There's a reason
things happen in our lives.

732
00:45:29,978 --> 00:45:33,273
Everything that happens is a lesson.

733
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:34,941
Don't forget this.

734
00:45:35,442 --> 00:45:38,778
Never let this moment die,
because this, bro,

735
00:45:39,112 --> 00:45:41,406
will turn you into a better man.

736
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:42,699
Cool?

737
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:46,369
Take each one of us with you, bro. Okay?

738
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,272
That's fucked up...

739
00:46:34,459 --> 00:46:36,669
I don't want anybody sad.

740
00:46:37,045 --> 00:46:39,547
Thanks, guys! Enjoy this fucking shit!

741
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:41,966
We're in this together, brother.

742
00:46:44,302 --> 00:46:47,096
Good luck, man. Now you're on your own.

743
00:46:48,473 --> 00:46:50,642
Go, brother. God bless you.

744
00:47:08,535 --> 00:47:10,703
How is it gonna be in the house?

745
00:47:10,828 --> 00:47:13,831
If people thought
there was a script, baby...

746
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:16,125
They were wrong.

747
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:21,339
Regardless of this being a reality show,
if that happens in real life...

748
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:24,050
You're in there, you go to the beach,

749
00:47:24,384 --> 00:47:30,390
you and ten friends, then one guy hits
another one, you send him home!

750
00:47:30,807 --> 00:47:33,851
- I'd leave.
- You'd leave or you'd send the guy away!

751
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:35,103
I do or he does.

752
00:47:35,270 --> 00:47:37,480
Everybody's already had
a friend who's been

753
00:47:37,647 --> 00:47:41,442
in a toxic relationship.
Somebody who had an abusive boyfriend

754
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:44,320
and, if I were told about this, I'd say,

755
00:47:44,487 --> 00:47:49,033
"Girl, I don't know."
Then you start to cut the couple off.

756
00:47:49,492 --> 00:47:53,663
Until she understands her boyfriend
is the problem. It's fucked up because...

757
00:47:53,788 --> 00:47:55,915
You have to be honest and say...

758
00:47:55,915 --> 00:47:58,126
- You have to tell her.
- ...I'd tell.

759
00:47:58,376 --> 00:47:59,502
What do you think?

760
00:47:59,711 --> 00:48:03,715
I was in an abusive relationship
for many years.

761
00:48:03,965 --> 00:48:06,968
It always starts with little things.

762
00:48:07,510 --> 00:48:11,806
They start to talk
about your clothes, your makeup,

763
00:48:11,973 --> 00:48:14,851
hide your perfume because
the scent is strong.

764
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:19,397
Tell me, when did you realize you were
in an abusive relationship?

765
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:21,649
I used to forgive him.

766
00:48:22,525 --> 00:48:26,112
One day, the person makes a scene.

767
00:48:26,279 --> 00:48:29,574
The other, he cries,
gets down on his knees,

768
00:48:29,782 --> 00:48:32,327
"Oh, forgive me, because I don't..."

769
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:35,163
Then you feel sorry for him...

770
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:38,666
It's what Carol said,
people really begin to move away.

771
00:48:38,833 --> 00:48:42,462
Today you know this, but when...

772
00:48:42,629 --> 00:48:47,091
How long did it take you to understand
that you were in an abusive relationship?

773
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,886
When did you realize it?

774
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:52,805
Man, I knew I was in something wrong,

775
00:48:52,972 --> 00:48:57,769
but you believe
the person is gonna change.

776
00:48:57,977 --> 00:49:03,232
But I reached a point I thought,
"I don't wanna go through this anymore."

777
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:05,276
Then I broke up.

778
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:07,904
- I really broke up.
- If you know someone

779
00:49:08,196 --> 00:49:12,283
who's in an abusive relationship,
open her eyes, say something...

780
00:49:12,575 --> 00:49:15,203
Tell the person,
a lot of people still think

781
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:20,583
that you shouldn't interfere
in couple's argument, but you should.

782
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:23,086
He said he's gonna try to help himself.

783
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:25,338
He's gonna take care of himself,

784
00:49:25,588 --> 00:49:29,759
and is giving Bia the chance
to enjoy her vacation, you know?

785
00:49:29,926 --> 00:49:32,679
I thought Murilo was very noble

786
00:49:32,887 --> 00:49:37,225
when he embraced Luan like a brother,
and said, "Cry, man. You made a mistake."

787
00:49:37,517 --> 00:49:39,811
Even after being hit three times.

788
00:49:39,811 --> 00:49:41,771
This is what friends do.

789
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:45,233
He was very noble for saying,
"Man, go see a doctor."

790
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:48,778
I think it's very important to say

791
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:52,115
that there's abusive relationship

792
00:49:52,407 --> 00:49:55,201
in the LGBTQIA-plus community.

793
00:49:55,535 --> 00:49:59,539
Every kind of person goes
through this sort of relationship.

794
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:02,208
It's nice when we look for help.

795
00:50:02,542 --> 00:50:06,421
Look it up on the Internet,
you'll find this kind of help.

796
00:50:06,546 --> 00:50:08,798
We can't go through this
and judge the person.

797
00:50:09,132 --> 00:50:11,801
Bia, for example, because,

798
00:50:12,051 --> 00:50:15,096
many times she wasn't aware
what was going on.

799
00:50:15,221 --> 00:50:17,014
I'm sure she's not aware.

800
00:50:17,140 --> 00:50:19,392
We're watching, you know?

801
00:50:19,392 --> 00:50:20,893
She just realized there.

802
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:25,148
I believe, I think everybody does too,
that Amazon had to do that.

803
00:50:25,398 --> 00:50:27,233
It honored the whole story...

804
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,610
And he had to understand and leave.

805
00:50:29,610 --> 00:50:33,322
I think that was the most predictable.
We were talking about this.

806
00:50:33,448 --> 00:50:35,992
He couldn't stay there anymore, man.

807
00:50:36,159 --> 00:50:39,078
- And violence is intolerable.
- Now I hope...

808
00:50:39,454 --> 00:50:42,415
- the vibe...
- Do you think she's gonna go wild?

809
00:50:42,415 --> 00:50:47,503
- Now the vibe will be relaxed!
- Let's move on, guys? Let's see it. Go.

810
00:50:48,045 --> 00:50:51,549
ON THE NEXT EPISODE

811
00:50:51,549 --> 00:50:53,509
You only live once, baby.

812
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:56,679
Oh, stop it, it's me!

813
00:50:56,888 --> 00:50:59,432
Stop it! I wanna leave!

814
00:51:06,731 --> 00:51:08,483
She broke a glass, man!

815
00:51:08,608 --> 00:51:09,942
"I wanna leave!"

816
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:11,527
"I wanna leave!"

817
00:51:11,736 --> 00:51:14,071
Jesus Christ, man. I...

818
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,365
Guys, who's that girl kissing?

819
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:19,035
- Is it Tay?
- It's Anna and Tay.

820
00:51:19,494 --> 00:51:21,078
I knew this was gonna happen.

821
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:24,165
They were very close since the beginning.

822
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:26,459
I didn't see this coming.

823
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:29,462
- I love kissing my girlfriends.
- Yeah!

824
00:51:29,796 --> 00:51:32,256
But Anna didn't give Tay any signals.

825
00:51:32,548 --> 00:51:36,552
She didn't give any signals
she wanted to hook up with her.

826
00:51:36,719 --> 00:51:39,388
- I kiss my girlfriends too.
- Guys, that's no big deal.

827
00:51:39,555 --> 00:51:41,808
Come on. Look, really,

828
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:44,393
kissing between friends is normal.

829
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:47,688
Bro, I can't believe this, man.

830
00:51:47,814 --> 00:51:50,900
- My car is here.
- Go, Carol!

831
00:51:51,067 --> 00:51:53,152
Girl, let's have sushi today.

832
00:51:53,361 --> 00:51:56,239
- Let's have it! Here we go!
- It's on me!

833
00:51:56,739 --> 00:51:59,075
Lexa will buy it, she's a rich singer.

834
00:51:59,367 --> 00:52:01,202
Lexa will pay, she has...

835
00:52:02,036 --> 00:52:04,247
Oh, oh, and shake the ass, oh, oh

836
00:52:04,455 --> 00:52:07,291
When you hear the bass
I'm gonna throw it in...
