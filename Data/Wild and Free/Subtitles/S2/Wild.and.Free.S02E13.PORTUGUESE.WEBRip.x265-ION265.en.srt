1
00:00:05,589 --> 00:00:07,133
Come, my daughter!

2
00:00:07,299 --> 00:00:09,051
I was always by your side.

3
00:00:09,593 --> 00:00:11,262
Sure, sis, but still...

4
00:00:11,262 --> 00:00:13,180
You can't!

5
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:14,640
I'm bringing my daughter!

6
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:21,647
Good afternoon, good evening, Brazil!

7
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:23,733
- We're here.
- Oh, my God!

8
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:25,985
We're here!

9
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,319
We're here

10
00:00:27,486 --> 00:00:29,321
They've got the same hairstyle.

11
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:32,032
- It's Pucca and big Pucca.
- Cute.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,285
Two Puccas!

13
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:35,619
Titto!

14
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:37,663
Your style goes with the plant.

15
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:39,832
- We always match.
- You're beautiful!

16
00:00:39,832 --> 00:00:43,335
Looks like we're going to the same party.
The neon party.

17
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:46,839
You're going to the fairy party.
Episode seven already!

18
00:00:46,839 --> 00:00:48,257
Our binge-watch, guys.

19
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:52,303
Look, Carol is crying,
tears of arousal... I mean,

20
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:54,513
- she's crying.
- I'm moved.

21
00:00:55,264 --> 00:00:57,850
I'm not ready to say goodbye to you.

22
00:00:57,850 --> 00:00:59,685
Guys, don't joke around, jeez!

23
00:00:59,852 --> 00:01:01,979
I'm not ready to say goodbye to Tay.

24
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:04,732
Easy, woman,
there's still one episode left.

25
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:08,486
You don't understand.
Guys, do you remember what happened?

26
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:11,071
Anna heard Renatinho having sex!

27
00:01:11,197 --> 00:01:12,865
It was very sad!

28
00:01:13,032 --> 00:01:15,993
- We ended with Tay hooking up with two...
- True.

29
00:01:15,993 --> 00:01:20,581
How's it gonna be in that house?
It is now episode seven, Murilo and Tay...

30
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:24,752
- They are not a couple anymore.
- I say friends with benefits.

31
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:27,671
- Like us.
- Like us, Pabllo.

32
00:01:27,671 --> 00:01:29,256
Let's hit play!

33
00:01:29,465 --> 00:01:30,466
Let's go!

34
00:02:00,412 --> 00:02:02,623
WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS 2

35
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:25,437
Hello, baby.

36
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:27,398
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

37
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:34,446
Anna hooked up with that guy yesterday?

38
00:02:38,367 --> 00:02:39,577
What about you?

39
00:02:39,702 --> 00:02:41,328
I hooked up with a girl.

40
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,830
That's bad.

41
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:44,874
How was work yesterday?

42
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:48,294
Was it good?

43
00:02:48,419 --> 00:02:49,962
- Fucking good.
- Really?

44
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:53,090
It's always good to work there.

45
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:56,135
I don't know why I really like that bar!

46
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,095
Hey, Renato!

47
00:03:03,601 --> 00:03:07,021
We're rude, we don't cry,
we say, "Yeah, brother, thanks!"

48
00:03:14,904 --> 00:03:16,655
- Bye.
- Bye, baby!

49
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:20,409
Bye, it was great having you here.

50
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,912
Did we get my other bag?

51
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:25,205
We'll deliver it to you later.

52
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:28,292
Be good, okay?

53
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,065
We're together, buddy.

54
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:52,316
In the front seat?

55
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:54,234
Oh, backseat, right?

56
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,030
What's up, brother?

57
00:03:58,906 --> 00:04:01,033
Are you cool? How are you, man?

58
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,245
Thanks, brother, thanks for everything.

59
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:06,830
We're together!

60
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:10,501
Go, win, buddy.

61
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:14,964
Did you kiss anybody?

62
00:04:14,964 --> 00:04:17,424
Yes, but there were few men yesterday.

63
00:04:18,968 --> 00:04:21,679
You? "Few men."

64
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:26,100
Jeez, I did at the last minute. I swear.

65
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:29,937
Then he came out of nowhere.

66
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,355
Did he save your night?

67
00:04:31,522 --> 00:04:32,731
I said, "Wow."

68
00:04:33,941 --> 00:04:36,235
I spent the entire night with him.

69
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,948
But yesterday was cool.

70
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:42,783
I bet.

71
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:55,879
I decided where to party tonight.
I'm gonna take you to Stage.

72
00:04:55,879 --> 00:05:00,509
Yeah! Let's go wild!

73
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,720
Nath, is Andrei going?

74
00:05:03,512 --> 00:05:04,930
- Your hands.
- Yes.

75
00:05:05,347 --> 00:05:07,099
Okay, then.

76
00:05:09,893 --> 00:05:11,478
The guy's stuck to Nath.

77
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:15,232
I think we have a new member, right?

78
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,317
I have this feeling.

79
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,945
Let's finish cleaning up in here,

80
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:22,823
- we rest a little...
- The night will be great!

81
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:25,534
Holy shit. They're gonna dance too.

82
00:05:25,701 --> 00:05:27,786
It's good there during the week!

83
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,679
The bus is here. Let's go.
Because today things are gonna get wild.

84
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,932
- Wild?
- Wild! Now?

85
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:51,101
Things are gonna get wild!

86
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,811
Things will get wild?

87
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:55,147
No crying!

88
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:05,908
You have to dance to funk music.

89
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,994
Yeah, this is important.

90
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:37,564
You're kinda sad, aren't you?

91
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,025
You're not kissing anybody.

92
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,611
Girl, I don't know, man. Like,

93
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:46,740
you and me, we go everywhere,
we go out, we're always together.

94
00:06:46,865 --> 00:06:48,659
You guys are a couple right?

95
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,661
Easy, it's been intense, but...

96
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,832
You fell for that guy,
you wanna marry him.

97
00:06:55,749 --> 00:06:58,210
Man, I'm enjoying it a lot,
I'm having fun!

98
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:02,506
But I didn't come here
to date or get married.

99
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,716
I came to have fun with you guys!

100
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:09,138
What are you gonna tell him?
How is it gonna be?

101
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:13,559
I'm gonna explain the relationship...
Explain the situation.

102
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:17,521
I'm gonna say,
"We should work things out,

103
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:20,149
"but now is not the moment."

104
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:23,944
- Girl, but...
- He has to understand!

105
00:07:24,069 --> 00:07:27,072
I didn't come here
to stay with him, it happened...

106
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:30,450
- It happened, it was very natural.
- It's being good!

107
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:33,495
- He's cute, he's very cool.
- I wanna have fun.

108
00:07:33,996 --> 00:07:36,540
I wanna have fun
and I want the same for him.

109
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:39,835
Now we share the bed, me, you and him.

110
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:41,753
We can't do this.

111
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:43,714
He's cute and...

112
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:48,093
Okay, but I'm gonna settle this.
Bebeto and Romário are coming back.

113
00:07:48,927 --> 00:07:50,387
I won't leave you alone.

114
00:08:29,718 --> 00:08:31,970
Oh, I don't wanna leave.

115
00:08:48,111 --> 00:08:50,113
Let's watch the sunrise.

116
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,699
Let's watch the sunrise, it's happening!

117
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,284
Let's get off!

118
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:58,038
- Don't fall.
- My head.

119
00:08:58,205 --> 00:08:59,957
You won't fall. Trust me.

120
00:09:00,624 --> 00:09:01,833
Jump.

121
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:04,628
- Ramon!
- Relax!

122
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:09,091
Relax. Trust me. You're gonna love it!

123
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:11,885
You're gonna push me downhill.

124
00:09:21,687 --> 00:09:24,982
Ramon, for you, Ramon.

125
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:27,442
Ramon, for you, Ramon.

126
00:09:33,615 --> 00:09:34,992
You don't know...

127
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:38,620
what's gonna happen tomorrow!

128
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,497
So, don't start saying

129
00:09:40,664 --> 00:09:43,125
"Nothing's gonna happen,
it won't work out!"

130
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,295
Everything is gonna be fine
in your life, dude.

131
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:49,381
That's it, brother.
That's it. That's life!

132
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:50,966
What are you smoking?

133
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:52,259
That's life!

134
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:54,803
He has to have...

135
00:09:55,470 --> 00:09:57,556
He has to have his moment.

136
00:09:57,556 --> 00:10:00,809
Grateful to the Universe!

137
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:06,231
Seriously grateful!

138
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,735
Grateful to be here now...
at this moment!

139
00:10:41,933 --> 00:10:43,393
I didn't do anything.

140
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,313
Ramon picked me up and I was sleeping.

141
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,482
- Relax.
- He's pissed!

142
00:10:48,607 --> 00:10:51,234
- He's pissed.
- No, he's not.

143
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:53,445
I was gonna hug him, he...

144
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,435
There you go.

145
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,897
Andrei, come sleep here...

146
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,027
You're safe!

147
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,866
I didn't do anything!
If you're upset, fine!

148
00:11:43,578 --> 00:11:46,706
I was asleep, okay?
Nothing happened.

149
00:11:49,167 --> 00:11:50,585
You wanna be upset, fine!

150
00:11:51,378 --> 00:11:52,546
Ready?

151
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,148
- Baby.
- Hi.

152
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:56,860
Let's go outside to talk.

153
00:13:05,368 --> 00:13:07,662
Tell me why you got upset yesterday.

154
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:13,043
I got upset because
I was taking care of you

155
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:17,589
and... I was drunk...

156
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,051
I was asleep, and Ramon carried me in,
it was not my fault!

157
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,428
- I know this.
- But you were angry.

158
00:13:24,596 --> 00:13:27,057
Yes. I was pissed.

159
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:33,772
Okay. I'm having fun.
I told everybody this,

160
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:40,445
but I didn't plan this, you know?
To be with somebody here...

161
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:44,533
It's the first time the four girls,
no, the three, are free...

162
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,911
Last vacation, everybody had company...

163
00:13:48,078 --> 00:13:51,623
and that doesn't mean
we're not gonna meet again.

164
00:13:51,748 --> 00:13:52,832
Okay.

165
00:13:52,958 --> 00:13:58,755
It doesn't mean I won't call you,
or invite you to go where we'll be,

166
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:04,469
but I need to know what I'm feeling.
I need to miss you, you know?

167
00:14:05,262 --> 00:14:06,721
Let's see what happens...

168
00:14:14,145 --> 00:14:15,689
Let's get away from the sun.

169
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,192
I'm gonna pack.

170
00:14:19,693 --> 00:14:21,152
Okay.

171
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,741
Take care, okay? Enjoy...

172
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:56,855
Just like Rayanne says,
I go to the bakery and fall in love.

173
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,441
Incredible.

174
00:15:07,532 --> 00:15:10,619
Enjoy. Take care of her for me.

175
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:12,871
I will, I'm gonna talk to Anna.

176
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:17,709
Relax, she'll be calling you soon!

177
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:20,211
I'm gonna talk to her.

178
00:15:21,838 --> 00:15:23,006
Thanks.

179
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,482
I'm gonna start by apologizing

180
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:44,402
for my bad attitude,

181
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,446
but...

182
00:15:48,990 --> 00:15:50,825
every action has a reaction.

183
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:56,289
And I've always been honest
about the feelings I have for you...

184
00:15:57,207 --> 00:16:01,252
What I wanted to have with you. Anyway,

185
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:05,674
I wanna know more about you.

186
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:11,805
If you're getting closer to me because
you want affection or you feel alone...

187
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:14,182
I'm not alone, I have the girls.

188
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:19,020
By alone, I mean
somebody there for you... You know?

189
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,189
Not that you don't have anyone.

190
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:23,358
Everybody is with you.

191
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:25,568
I just wanna figure this out.

192
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:29,155
Tell me something that will...

193
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:33,660
comfort me... Not comfort me, but...

194
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:39,874
That thing about not being a couple,
that's what I've always told the girls,

195
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:42,043
I didn't want to force this.

196
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:45,672
I think we both know
what we feel for each other.

197
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:50,093
Honestly, I didn't really want to hook up
with any of those guys.

198
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:54,723
It was just the moment,
I thought, "Oh, I'm not doing anything."

199
00:16:54,848 --> 00:16:57,809
I was trying to explain
when I threw the photo away.

200
00:16:57,976 --> 00:17:01,271
I told you, "Bro, I threw
that picture away yesterday."

201
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:04,941
Like, when everything happened.
But you wouldn't let me speak!

202
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:07,694
Let's work things out.

203
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:10,488
That's what I have to offer.

204
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:14,117
We don't have to force things,
just let it be.

205
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:17,370
It's not about forcing anything, you know?

206
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:20,540
I just don't wanna be let down.

207
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:22,542
That won't happen.

208
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:26,671
I don't wanna see you
hooking up with another guy.

209
00:17:29,382 --> 00:17:32,635
That's not gonna happen.
This would never have happened.

210
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:35,930
I just didn't want to label it.

211
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:38,391
We don't have to label it.

212
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,144
I never wanted to kiss another guy.

213
00:17:41,394 --> 00:17:46,107
It's not a label.

214
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:50,195
It's just being together.

215
00:17:52,489 --> 00:17:53,740
Nothing else.

216
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:56,785
We have to be partners.

217
00:17:58,787 --> 00:17:59,913
Okay.

218
00:18:00,538 --> 00:18:02,332
Can you kiss me in the neck?

219
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:28,483
I came here earlier to ask
for something, when we were at home...

220
00:18:28,483 --> 00:18:32,362
So, today we're gonna go
to a forró party at DeRaiz.

221
00:18:32,529 --> 00:18:34,155
We're going to DeRaiz?

222
00:18:34,364 --> 00:18:36,991
We were talking about that place today.

223
00:18:36,991 --> 00:18:40,578
You can wear flip-flops there if you want.

224
00:18:40,578 --> 00:18:42,622
Let's go. DeRaiz, let's get wild!

225
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:45,542
I can't believe we're going to DeRaiz.

226
00:18:45,667 --> 00:18:47,544
The bus is here. Let's go, man!

227
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:51,005
Let's go! Go!

228
00:18:51,005 --> 00:18:52,507
We're gonna dance close.

229
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:08,940
Today, there's forró music

230
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:13,987
Oh, man!

231
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:16,739
We're gonna dance.

232
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:33,590
It's catuaba!

233
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:11,502
It's my best friend!

234
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:30,980
Oh, my God!

235
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:44,035
I wanted you to be here so bad.

236
00:20:44,869 --> 00:20:46,537
Wow, they're already kissing.

237
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:54,170
Jeez.

238
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:57,590
Crazy! She's the first one!

239
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:01,177
Nath.

240
00:21:01,344 --> 00:21:03,805
Renatinho.

241
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:07,767
That's what I fucking like!

242
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:09,060
Ramon.

243
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:12,480
Murilo.

244
00:21:13,690 --> 00:21:15,858
Does she know Renato?

245
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:19,362
This is my guy from Rio.

246
00:21:23,825 --> 00:21:27,662
It'll be fine.

247
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:31,165
- I'm not going.
- Go use flamingo with her!

248
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,919
- With Milena.
- I'll use it tomorrow!

249
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,006
No way.

250
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:40,133
Have you met?

251
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,885
You know you've met this guy.

252
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:46,514
- What's your name?
- Milena.

253
00:21:50,935 --> 00:21:52,478
He wants to go camping.

254
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,814
Let's go camping, guys?

255
00:21:54,939 --> 00:21:56,232
Invite everybody!

256
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:57,942
Everybody!

257
00:21:57,942 --> 00:21:59,861
Easy, don't talk about this.

258
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:03,531
Guys! Let's go camping tomorrow?

259
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:05,700
Go camping.

260
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,244
Going camping, no.

261
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,585
Fuck!

262
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,756
I need to relax!

263
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:22,175
Are you serious?

264
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:29,515
Yeah, shake your ass.

265
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,267
I can't.

266
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,020
I shake it a lot.

267
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:14,102
That chick who got here was the one
you hooked up with in Rio?

268
00:23:14,936 --> 00:23:17,438
I hooked up with her a couple of times.

269
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,065
- With Milena?
- Yes!

270
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:22,235
No, we hooked up a lot, but...

271
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:26,697
we stopped, the thing ended...

272
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:28,074
You guys moved on.

273
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:30,576
We moved on and I met Anna, you know?

274
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:32,286
It's gonna be awkward

275
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:36,499
if you talk there today.

276
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:39,085
She said, "Oh, let's..."
You can't have fun.

277
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:41,337
What's your story with her?

278
00:23:41,462 --> 00:23:42,672
We don't even know.

279
00:23:42,839 --> 00:23:45,675
We talked and decided to let it be.

280
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:48,302
But I get it.

281
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:51,681
A guy from Rio got here,
they have something.

282
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:53,933
He doesn't know about anything.

283
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:56,853
They must be together a long time.

284
00:23:57,019 --> 00:24:00,273
I got here and hooked up
with a bunch of girls.

285
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:01,399
So you know?

286
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:02,692
It's cool.

287
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:06,320
Come and see.

288
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:11,284
I'm not gonna go camping.

289
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:16,122
We'll sleep together.

290
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,001
You're smiling, naughty girl.

291
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:22,545
I don't like you.

292
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:24,589
That's okay.

293
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:26,883
I don't like blondies.

294
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,218
And I don't like you.

295
00:24:31,596 --> 00:24:32,805
Can I talk to you?

296
00:24:33,598 --> 00:24:35,224
No. Sure you can.

297
00:24:38,102 --> 00:24:39,395
I'll have sex with him.

298
00:24:39,562 --> 00:24:41,522
Will you forgive me?

299
00:24:45,276 --> 00:24:49,155
He's my... He's my brother from Rio.

300
00:24:49,155 --> 00:24:51,324
Bro, relax. Look, enjoy!

301
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:54,702
It's my moment.

302
00:24:56,204 --> 00:24:58,414
It's not because I don't want it.

303
00:24:58,539 --> 00:25:00,875
I'm very happy with what's going on.

304
00:25:03,461 --> 00:25:05,046
- I know, enjoy.
- Thanks.

305
00:25:11,928 --> 00:25:13,387
What about you and Ramon?

306
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:16,265
We're just having fun.

307
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:17,600
Do you like him?

308
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:20,853
No, I don't, but I miss him.

309
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,066
I don't know how to explain what I feel.

310
00:25:25,066 --> 00:25:27,652
- I'm jealous...
- Friendship with benefits.

311
00:25:27,652 --> 00:25:32,740
Sometimes I don't care
seeing him with other girls,

312
00:25:33,658 --> 00:25:36,160
sometimes I do.

313
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:39,080
I can't explain!

314
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:42,375
When he gets close to me, I...

315
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:48,881
You've seen it. I showed you.

316
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,969
That's fucked up, I'm afraid.

317
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:55,888
I like him,
but we know each other's place.

318
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:07,650
Guys, listen up!

319
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:11,862
The party here is over,
so let's keep partying at home.

320
00:26:11,988 --> 00:26:13,823
Let's do it!

321
00:26:13,948 --> 00:26:17,034
Let's go! Funk!

322
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:30,131
Hold my skirt,
or I'll put my hand there.

323
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:33,759
Girl, I like it.

324
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:44,270
Let's go!

325
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:47,398
Go, man!

326
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:49,859
- She fell on the driver.
- Nath did?

327
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:51,736
Yes, on the driver.

328
00:26:54,447 --> 00:26:56,699
Guys, let's go to the sex room.

329
00:27:06,959 --> 00:27:10,171
This is the sex room!

330
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:30,816
- Anna is on fire.
- She really is.

331
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,651
Guys, for God's sake.

332
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:35,321
It happens. Don't judge her.

333
00:27:35,946 --> 00:27:37,615
We won't!

334
00:27:39,533 --> 00:27:41,243
Will she remember it tomorrow?

335
00:27:41,410 --> 00:27:43,037
Of course, she's very sober.

336
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:46,040
- Really?
- She's just tipsy.

337
00:27:46,165 --> 00:27:48,667
Yeah, that's what I said. For us...

338
00:27:48,834 --> 00:27:51,128
Yeah, it's normal for her, not for us.

339
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:56,592
I have friends who do that,
but discreetly.

340
00:27:56,592 --> 00:28:00,596
Yeah, it seems she does that all the time.

341
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:04,433
Is Renatinho there too?

342
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:07,561
He's not interested.

343
00:28:08,813 --> 00:28:10,022
He's pissed.

344
00:28:13,484 --> 00:28:15,694
- I'm shocked!
- Ménage!

345
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:18,614
Ménage!

346
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:21,242
He's a friend with benefits.

347
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:25,246
And now Renatinho slept all by himself.

348
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:30,042
It was almost like Brazil
versus Germany, a 7-0.

349
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:31,836
Some people have plenty,

350
00:28:31,961 --> 00:28:35,131
- some people have nothing.
- He slept holding his dick.

351
00:28:35,297 --> 00:28:40,344
The competition is ruthless. I don't know
who was the one that made out the most!

352
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:43,597
Would you invite Renatinho, Carol,
if you were Anna?

353
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,059
Man, I've never done those things.

354
00:28:48,269 --> 00:28:51,439
I think, when there's a crowd,
you can't...

355
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:54,316
A friend to everyone
is a friend to no one.

356
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:57,653
You can't fuck
ten people at the same time.

357
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:00,573
- Speak for yourself.
- You don't have to do this...

358
00:29:00,698 --> 00:29:02,700
- What?
- Speak for yourself.

359
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:05,661
Can you fuck ten people,
at the same time?

360
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:07,329
You must have a huge dick, man.

361
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:11,292
I can't fuck ten people all at once.

362
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:13,878
If you think sex
is just about penetration...

363
00:29:14,003 --> 00:29:15,629
That's it!

364
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,174
What is it, Carol? Did you choke?

365
00:29:19,467 --> 00:29:21,010
Fuck!

366
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:26,432
Guys, what about Nath? She broke up
with Andrei, and hooked up with Ramon.

367
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:29,268
- What do you think now?
- I ate my words.

368
00:29:29,393 --> 00:29:34,940
I ate, swallowed and puked them.

369
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:38,486
Nath always surprises me.
An icon that surprises.

370
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:43,866
I gotta tell you, I'm very curious
about them going camping.

371
00:29:43,866 --> 00:29:48,370
- You didn't take that seriously...
- Is that gonna happen?

372
00:29:48,579 --> 00:29:54,001
They're gonna go camping for sure,
and Ramon said they'll sleep together!

373
00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:56,045
Meaning...

374
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,339
There's gonna be sex!

375
00:29:58,464 --> 00:30:00,216
Her tent will shake.

376
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:25,533
Hey, girls, let's go!

377
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,536
Let's go! It's time.

378
00:30:29,662 --> 00:30:33,874
How am I going downstairs?
Help me, because this bag is yours.

379
00:30:33,874 --> 00:30:35,751
Go, pull it from the back.

380
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:36,961
Pull it like this.

381
00:30:37,086 --> 00:30:38,796
That's why she's your girl.

382
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:41,549
Let's go, get it later.

383
00:30:41,715 --> 00:30:43,676
Go Praia do Rosa, forget it.

384
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,232
Let's go.

385
00:31:05,364 --> 00:31:09,910
Renatinho, what about you?
Did you get upset when...

386
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,537
Oh, bro, like...

387
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:16,417
Yesterday was, like... The final strike.

388
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:19,044
I got hit and felt it...

389
00:31:19,044 --> 00:31:20,629
There were two, right?

390
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:24,466
I'm cool now, you know? Yesterday was...

391
00:31:24,633 --> 00:31:27,219
That's because
you settled things, right?

392
00:31:27,344 --> 00:31:29,555
The same day, you decided...

393
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:35,144
We were gonna relax yesterday,
use the Flamingo later, at night...

394
00:31:35,144 --> 00:31:38,897
That's what I said to her
and everybody, I said,

395
00:31:39,023 --> 00:31:41,859
"Bro, you just had to wait, you know?"

396
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:47,948
You should've said to Renatinho, "My man
is here and I wanna be with him."

397
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:52,703
But she was so excited
because of her friends,

398
00:31:52,703 --> 00:31:57,583
- she was happy!
- She wanted her friends to come so bad!

399
00:31:57,708 --> 00:32:03,297
I swear, I am.
Yesterday, fuck... I was a little hurt.

400
00:32:03,422 --> 00:32:05,341
Sure, that's fucked up to see.

401
00:32:05,341 --> 00:32:11,221
It was one party, like,
I had nowhere to run, you know?

402
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:15,893
I had nobody to hook up with, you know?

403
00:32:16,477 --> 00:32:18,854
I had to be cool there,

404
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:21,482
pretend things, to not get in her way.

405
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:22,983
And you didn't, bro.

406
00:32:22,983 --> 00:32:25,861
My intention was, like...

407
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:31,033
the chick is fucking happy,
I'm not gonna... You know?

408
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:32,576
Get in her way.

409
00:32:33,369 --> 00:32:36,288
Go and show everybody,
let the world see things.

410
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:39,875
Do a striptease, show your boobs!

411
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,601
Praia do Rosa, I'm here!

412
00:32:58,811 --> 00:33:00,354
I'm here!

413
00:33:00,479 --> 00:33:01,814
I'm here!

414
00:33:01,814 --> 00:33:04,441
Oh, hey, that's crazy!

415
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:07,778
That's crazy, we're here.

416
00:33:10,739 --> 00:33:14,118
Renato! Praia do Rosa, Renato,
Renato, Praia do Rosa.

417
00:33:14,618 --> 00:33:16,120
It's a blessed place, huh?

418
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:20,749
Let's get the things. It's wonderful.

419
00:33:20,958 --> 00:33:23,752
I know nothing. That's new.

420
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:29,967
It's on the beach.

421
00:33:37,433 --> 00:33:38,684
Look at this view!

422
00:33:48,652 --> 00:33:51,071
- Floripa!
- What a view!

423
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:53,407
Damn, that's bizarre!

424
00:33:53,574 --> 00:33:54,825
That's crazy!

425
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,285
I couldn't wait.

426
00:33:57,828 --> 00:33:59,163
Guys...

427
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:00,956
where are we gonna sleep?

428
00:34:01,165 --> 00:34:02,332
- Down there!
- There?

429
00:34:02,583 --> 00:34:04,501
Down there. Let's stay...

430
00:34:04,668 --> 00:34:06,253
Where do I dry my hair?

431
00:34:06,462 --> 00:34:08,046
We'll have to finish...

432
00:34:08,255 --> 00:34:09,506
In the woods.

433
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:11,675
Where will I put my eyelashes?

434
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,094
We're gonna stay down there.

435
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:15,888
Let's go, then.

436
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:19,099
- Is it here?
- Yes, it's here!

437
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:25,606
That's it, didn't you want
something roots?

438
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:27,608
Think about the tent.

439
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,279
Let's go? Don't let it spin. Look.

440
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:36,074
Hey, you're gonna need help
to set up the tent.

441
00:34:36,283 --> 00:34:38,202
- Pull that.
- Here!

442
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:40,120
Like this.

443
00:34:40,746 --> 00:34:42,164
Are you sure?

444
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:44,291
It's mended here.

445
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,585
Is it wet? Okay, I forgive you.

446
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:55,135
Look, one little cold thing!

447
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:57,679
Fuck!

448
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,139
Let's toast!

449
00:34:59,765 --> 00:35:04,144
To this wonderful place, bro.
The moon, the sea, the sand, man.

450
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:08,482
To these people
who are here, that's us, man.

451
00:35:08,649 --> 00:35:11,318
We're in Floripa!

452
00:35:13,070 --> 00:35:15,989
Let's get wasted at the beach.

453
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,117
Wasted watching the moon!

454
00:35:19,785 --> 00:35:25,582
One for all and all for one!
One for all and all for one!

455
00:35:27,584 --> 00:35:28,877
Praia do Rosa, fuck!

456
00:35:29,044 --> 00:35:30,796
We have to stick together!

457
00:35:31,004 --> 00:35:32,965
Yeah, crying.

458
00:35:39,513 --> 00:35:42,140
Guys, we could do something, right?

459
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:45,352
- We could.
- We don't have anything to do, a party...

460
00:35:46,061 --> 00:35:47,980
That's happiness, right?

461
00:35:48,105 --> 00:35:51,859
Last time I came here,
I went with a brother to a bar.

462
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:53,402
- Which one?
- Bukit.

463
00:35:53,527 --> 00:35:55,237
Let's go there!

464
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:57,447
"Fuckit"?

465
00:35:57,447 --> 00:36:01,118
I think we should...

466
00:36:01,118 --> 00:36:03,745
get dressed and go to this bar.

467
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:06,081
- I agree!
- I'm ready.

468
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:09,126
That's it, guys, we'll go to Bukit

469
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:11,086
or shall we call it "Fuckit"?

470
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,592
We're gonna go fucking wild!

471
00:36:25,392 --> 00:36:27,185
Go, Carioca, lead the way.

472
00:36:41,283 --> 00:36:43,035
One for all and all for one!

473
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:47,539
One for all and all for one!

474
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:05,557
I have to tell you
something really serious.

475
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:09,102
- Fuck you!
- It's my last party!

476
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:10,354
- No way!
- For real!

477
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:12,314
- Why?
- Because I have to go.

478
00:37:12,439 --> 00:37:14,983
It's our last party, you know?

479
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:17,444
Fuck, that's bad news.

480
00:37:18,153 --> 00:37:19,780
A toast to you.

481
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:28,038
It tastes like medicine.

482
00:37:28,747 --> 00:37:30,832
Are you leaving tomorrow?

483
00:37:30,958 --> 00:37:35,504
I want us to have
the best night ever, you know?

484
00:37:35,629 --> 00:37:37,881
No, that's crazy. Like it or not,

485
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:44,137
you're like a brother from outside,
that I used to call, to have fun.

486
00:37:44,137 --> 00:37:46,098
You have good stories here.

487
00:37:46,098 --> 00:37:49,226
If I'm here today,
that's because of you, you know?

488
00:37:49,226 --> 00:37:53,021
Bro, you're here because,
I know you're used to this.

489
00:37:54,147 --> 00:37:59,319
And you live your life to the fullest,
everybody loves you,

490
00:37:59,444 --> 00:38:01,279
everybody wanted you

491
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:04,700
to join us until the end, so...

492
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:09,287
- I fucking love you.
- I'm sad, but...

493
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:11,540
I want this night to be

494
00:38:12,124 --> 00:38:14,042
the best we've ever had here.

495
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:16,086
The best night!

496
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:18,380
I'm gonna have to drink.

497
00:38:21,842 --> 00:38:26,179
Let's go get fucking wild!

498
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:38,108
Are you fucking crying?

499
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:46,199
We're here.

500
00:38:48,118 --> 00:38:49,619
I'm crying.

501
00:38:49,828 --> 00:38:53,373
I said I wouldn't cry anymore.
I'm crying because of you again,

502
00:38:53,498 --> 00:38:54,708
fucking bitch!

503
00:38:54,708 --> 00:38:57,252
Tonight is gonna be crazy.

504
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:05,635
Are you listening, Rê?

505
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:14,561
The affection we had, the hook-ups,
don't affect our friendship,

506
00:39:14,686 --> 00:39:16,021
you know that!

507
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:19,274
Except the times
we got mad at each other...

508
00:39:19,441 --> 00:39:22,569
but I fucking like you. You know?

509
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:25,322
Yeah, I agree,
you feel sorry a lot. You do.

510
00:39:25,489 --> 00:39:27,532
Because I worry about you.

511
00:39:27,741 --> 00:39:29,493
I worry a lot.

512
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:32,871
It has nothing to do with it,
it's something else.

513
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,748
You know that, right?

514
00:39:34,956 --> 00:39:37,584
His sign is cancer!

515
00:39:37,751 --> 00:39:39,795
He cries a lot, very emotional.

516
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,839
I really do, fuck!

517
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,319
Who? She who?

518
00:40:04,486 --> 00:40:06,029
She who?

519
00:40:06,154 --> 00:40:07,572
What's up? Holy shit.

520
00:40:11,535 --> 00:40:14,621
But it's for Nath, it's for Nath, relax.

521
00:40:15,288 --> 00:40:17,582
It's for Nath. It's just a friend, relax.

522
00:40:18,416 --> 00:40:20,752
No, if Anna does that...

523
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,130
- It's not.
- If she does that,

524
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,965
I'm gonna play her game.

525
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:27,259
It's not, it's for Nath.

526
00:40:28,009 --> 00:40:29,803
I told him.

527
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:33,223
Believe it, it's for Nath.

528
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:34,933
Trust me.

529
00:40:35,142 --> 00:40:37,352
Fuck!

530
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:39,437
It's a friend who came along.

531
00:40:39,604 --> 00:40:42,149
I'm gonna introduce you as my guy.

532
00:40:42,274 --> 00:40:44,818
Yeah, relax, Nath's the one who wants him.

533
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:47,404
Come, Ítalo, cut the crap.

534
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:53,410
Ítalo is one of the boys too,
and this is Diogo.

535
00:40:54,202 --> 00:40:55,620
Nice to meet you.

536
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:58,081
This is Ítalo.

537
00:40:58,206 --> 00:40:59,749
What's up, brother?

538
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:02,460
I'm fine.

539
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:04,004
I'm fine.

540
00:41:04,129 --> 00:41:06,715
Welcome. Make yourself at home.

541
00:41:06,715 --> 00:41:08,633
Hey, make yourselves at home!

542
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,428
That's it, they're home.

543
00:41:11,428 --> 00:41:14,014
There are the girls too,
they're back there.

544
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:16,099
Honestly, make yourself at home.

545
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:20,145
I'm gonna fill up my glass.

546
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:23,231
If you play me...

547
00:41:24,024 --> 00:41:25,567
Do you think I'd do that?

548
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:27,861
It's easier you do this to me.

549
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:31,448
Only if you give me the glass. Ítalo.

550
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:34,534
- I'm being honest with you.
-Ítalo!

551
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:36,494
Am I that kind of woman?

552
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:38,872
Stop that!

553
00:41:49,633 --> 00:41:53,637
Look how many girls
are at that table.

554
00:41:54,930 --> 00:41:56,223
Come here!

555
00:41:58,558 --> 00:42:01,770
Bro, go there!

556
00:42:01,895 --> 00:42:03,313
In the bathroom?

557
00:42:03,855 --> 00:42:08,068
You're gonna hook up
with that chick, right here, wearing pink.

558
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:09,444
Invite everybody...

559
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:12,489
Go there, invite everybody
to the afterparty.

560
00:42:13,073 --> 00:42:15,033
How are you, girls?

561
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:17,118
We're gonna throw an afterparty.

562
00:42:17,786 --> 00:42:19,579
At Praia do Rosa.

563
00:42:19,788 --> 00:42:22,040
Here at Praia do Rosa!

564
00:42:22,791 --> 00:42:25,043
- What?
- What part?

565
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:27,462
Look, I'm from Rio...

566
00:42:27,629 --> 00:42:31,007
I'm from Rio,
I don't even know where we are.

567
00:42:31,007 --> 00:42:35,011
I know I'm at Praia do Rosa.

568
00:42:35,011 --> 00:42:39,724
We're having a fucking blast,
I want you to come very much.

569
00:42:39,891 --> 00:42:42,227
It's my last night here.

570
00:42:42,352 --> 00:42:43,770
Come on, let's go.

571
00:42:44,854 --> 00:42:50,402
It's my last night here. I'd like you
to stay and have fun with us.

572
00:42:50,402 --> 00:42:52,988
Come on. Do we have a deal?

573
00:42:52,988 --> 00:42:55,240
- Do we have a deal?
- And the boys?

574
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:57,492
Do we have a deal?

575
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:01,746
Tonight, we have an afterparty!

576
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:05,000
Oh, fuck!

577
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:10,839
He doesn't hunt!

578
00:43:11,006 --> 00:43:12,507
Crazy girl!

579
00:43:12,674 --> 00:43:14,134
Her energy's different...

580
00:43:14,342 --> 00:43:16,094
To your crazy boy.

581
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:20,640
No, bro, her energy,
what she can offer everybody,

582
00:43:20,807 --> 00:43:22,392
you know?

583
00:43:22,559 --> 00:43:25,645
- That's it, Muzinho.
- It's so much joy.

584
00:43:25,854 --> 00:43:29,190
It's so much empathy and partnership!

585
00:43:29,774 --> 00:43:31,192
- What?
- No, you won't.

586
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:34,612
That's right, the girl
checked you out, and you...

587
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:35,905
- Wait.
- Fuck that!

588
00:43:37,657 --> 00:43:39,659
The other girls are looking at us.

589
00:43:41,453 --> 00:43:43,830
Stop being jealous, man.

590
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:44,998
You're fucked!

591
00:43:45,165 --> 00:43:46,541
What? No, but it's...

592
00:43:46,708 --> 00:43:49,294
But, if you wanna
hook up with a girl, do it.

593
00:43:49,419 --> 00:43:51,296
But the thing is, I am a player.

594
00:43:53,048 --> 00:43:54,257
Express this, then.

595
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:58,136
No, but I express it! I do!

596
00:44:05,769 --> 00:44:10,440
What about Ítalo?
I can't understand what happened now.

597
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:13,526
I joke around, damn,
like I did with Renatinho.

598
00:44:13,693 --> 00:44:17,489
You used to get confused
later, in the end.

599
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:20,658
You got upset
when he had sex with other girls.

600
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:24,996
It was because I didn't expect that,
it wasn't because I liked him.

601
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:27,791
Then I didn't know how I was gonna react.

602
00:44:27,916 --> 00:44:30,543
You didn't expect
he was gonna fuck somebody?

603
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:31,836
- No, girl!
- Really?

604
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:33,296
No, I didn't!

605
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:34,631
I was sure!

606
00:44:34,756 --> 00:44:37,926
He used to ask me at every party we were,

607
00:44:38,093 --> 00:44:40,220
"Are we gonna be cool?"

608
00:44:40,345 --> 00:44:43,223
- I'd say, "Let's kiss everybody!"
- You first,

609
00:44:43,348 --> 00:44:44,891
then would come others...

610
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:46,643
Yes, obviously!

611
00:44:46,768 --> 00:44:48,186
And I always said,

612
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:50,772
"Let's go to the game!"

613
00:44:50,939 --> 00:44:53,691
That's because
I can't be like Ramon, Renato...

614
00:44:53,817 --> 00:44:57,070
- Who takes girls home, I can't.
- I can't either...

615
00:44:57,195 --> 00:45:00,323
But, girl, Ítalo's a piece of shit,

616
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:01,866
- he's no good.
- I know.

617
00:45:01,866 --> 00:45:04,411
I know when it comes to womanizers!

618
00:45:04,411 --> 00:45:06,830
We've been together for one year.

619
00:45:06,830 --> 00:45:10,875
I have this feeling of ownership.

620
00:45:11,084 --> 00:45:13,628
I had sex with his friend,
and he freaked out.

621
00:45:13,795 --> 00:45:18,091
Then he gave me
the opportunity to do the same.

622
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:19,968
And what about Renato leaving?

623
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:24,639
He's cute. I'm sad. He's sweet,
he won the house over.

624
00:45:24,806 --> 00:45:25,890
Will you kiss him?

625
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:28,685
- No.
- My plan is gonna be...

626
00:45:28,852 --> 00:45:32,439
You and Ítalo here,
he and Mi by your side.

627
00:45:32,439 --> 00:45:34,274
- Yeah.
- I knew it!

628
00:45:34,858 --> 00:45:36,568
I'm sure this is gonna happen!

629
00:45:36,693 --> 00:45:40,113
It's a mess, but not totally.

630
00:45:40,113 --> 00:45:41,656
Did he have sex with Mi?

631
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:47,328
The three of us. I had with her...

632
00:45:55,378 --> 00:45:57,297
Come here!

633
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:04,220
Hey, there's a hot dog
for everybody down the street.

634
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:07,223
Are you in? Or do you wanna go home?

635
00:46:07,348 --> 00:46:10,560
Let's eat a hot dog!

636
00:46:10,727 --> 00:46:14,606
Now you're excited, right? I knew it.

637
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:16,357
I was waiting for it.

638
00:46:17,233 --> 00:46:18,485
Let's go!

639
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:21,070
Let's enjoy this hot dog.

640
00:46:24,324 --> 00:46:25,909
Anna, look.

641
00:46:25,909 --> 00:46:28,203
She tripped, I didn't do anything.

642
00:46:28,328 --> 00:46:30,705
She really tripped!

643
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:34,959
- I took two guys there, nobody touched me.
- Is it my fault?

644
00:46:36,085 --> 00:46:39,339
Bro, you gave her the opportunity.
Don't lie!

645
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:44,594
Anna, I said, "Let's enjoy the hot dog."
She said, "Let's go." She did that.

646
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:47,430
Okay, so enjoy your hot dog.

647
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:50,642
The girl came holding his hand.

648
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:53,686
- Who?
- That girl was holding his hand.

649
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:57,106
But he's wrong.

650
00:46:57,315 --> 00:47:00,610
I took two guys to the box
and I didn't hook up with them.

651
00:47:00,777 --> 00:47:04,405
I said it was for Nath,
it was a friend of a guy Nath wanted.

652
00:47:06,616 --> 00:47:08,284
- Listen up.
- What did I do?

653
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:11,162
You were holding her hands! Why?

654
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:12,914
Arm in arm!

655
00:47:13,081 --> 00:47:15,500
You two were arm in arm until that point.

656
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:18,836
- But I let her go.
- Stop lying.

657
00:47:18,962 --> 00:47:22,882
I'm not lying! The thing is,
she gave me her arm, I let go of it.

658
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:26,261
Sure, I saw you let go of it!

659
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:29,889
- I looked back and walked away.
- I let go of it!

660
00:47:30,932 --> 00:47:32,600
Who's with me right now?

661
00:47:33,309 --> 00:47:36,813
But that fucking girl held your hand.

662
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:40,858
What if it happened to me?
You freaked out with those two boys!

663
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:43,111
You threatened me, like, "If you..."

664
00:47:43,236 --> 00:47:44,821
She crossed the line.

665
00:47:44,821 --> 00:47:48,741
I'm taking the blame
for something that chick did.

666
00:47:48,908 --> 00:47:52,704
It's on her because she held your hand,
but you allowed that!

667
00:47:52,829 --> 00:47:54,038
No! I let go!

668
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:58,293
- No! I saw it!
- When she held my hand, I let go of it.

669
00:47:58,418 --> 00:48:00,378
When she did it, I let go of it!

670
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:04,757
If she had held my hand,
and I had accepted it,

671
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:08,177
then you could be like this,
but I let go of her hand!

672
00:48:08,344 --> 00:48:10,138
I saw you were both arm in arm.

673
00:48:10,263 --> 00:48:12,223
But that was when you looked.

674
00:48:12,390 --> 00:48:15,226
- So I'm wrong?
- Yes, you are!

675
00:48:15,435 --> 00:48:18,313
- You're right?
- Stop tripping! I'm with you.

676
00:48:24,611 --> 00:48:27,196
Do you have hot dogs for everybody?

677
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:31,284
Let's eat!

678
00:48:31,284 --> 00:48:34,287
You can prepare them because we're hungry!

679
00:48:34,412 --> 00:48:37,540
Put the sausage! Put the...

680
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:45,131
I think that's funny,
everybody's gonna sleep on the sand!

681
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:48,760
The guests sleep on the sand.
If they want it. Or leave!

682
00:48:49,052 --> 00:48:50,219
Seriously.

683
00:48:50,678 --> 00:48:52,722
- Please.
- What do you want?

684
00:48:52,722 --> 00:48:55,767
- Are you looking at me?
- Damn, Anna.

685
00:48:55,975 --> 00:48:57,727
- Easy there.
- Look, stop!

686
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,687
Anna Retonde!

687
00:48:59,687 --> 00:49:01,606
- Did you hear that?
- Look at me!

688
00:49:02,315 --> 00:49:03,733
Stop it, Anna!

689
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,735
You saw her mocking me, right?

690
00:49:05,902 --> 00:49:10,365
Tripping, you're tripping.

691
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,408
Nathália's not alone there!

692
00:49:15,536 --> 00:49:18,915
Stop it, what's that, Murilo?

693
00:49:18,915 --> 00:49:21,959
- You don't have to go there.
- Murilo!

694
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:24,170
She's the same that held his hand.

695
00:49:24,379 --> 00:49:25,797
So, girl.

696
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,132
She's disrespectful to you and herself.

697
00:49:28,257 --> 00:49:30,968
You're not the problem,
you can do what you want!

698
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:33,513
She mocked me.

699
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:36,224
But did you joke around?

700
00:49:36,349 --> 00:49:39,519
- You did.
- I said, "Call them."

701
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:41,896
- I was joking.
- Hey, I'm gonna be upset.

702
00:49:42,647 --> 00:49:43,898
I don't interfere...

703
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:46,693
Okay. No, but I don't like these...

704
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:48,611
Let's call the night nicely?

705
00:49:48,736 --> 00:49:49,862
Please.

706
00:49:50,029 --> 00:49:52,073
Now I'm gonna leave Nathália alone?

707
00:49:52,198 --> 00:49:54,283
- You made fun of her or not?
- She did.

708
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:57,120
- She did!
- I think she's seeing the joke.

709
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,623
- She did!
- No, be honest!

710
00:50:00,748 --> 00:50:02,291
That's why I came here.

711
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:05,211
- I was joking.
- We also joke, but...

712
00:50:05,461 --> 00:50:08,423
we wanna know what you said.

713
00:50:08,631 --> 00:50:10,133
Did you say...

714
00:50:10,299 --> 00:50:11,968
I don't remember...

715
00:50:12,218 --> 00:50:14,303
It was five seconds ago!

716
00:50:14,429 --> 00:50:17,432
No, we just wanna know
what happened, because...

717
00:50:17,557 --> 00:50:20,893
- Man, I owe you nothing.

718
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:23,354
- You do!
- Let's go!

719
00:50:28,192 --> 00:50:29,777
Easy!

720
00:50:30,903 --> 00:50:32,029
What happened?

721
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:34,157
They ruined the afterparty?

722
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:38,202
Murilo, afterparty is over!

723
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:47,044
Nathália's here.

724
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:49,464
Tell me, are we gonna get there?

725
00:50:49,589 --> 00:50:50,715
Murilo is a pitbull.

726
00:50:50,882 --> 00:50:53,134
We arrive at our mansion 2.0.

727
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:54,302
Afterparty!

728
00:50:54,427 --> 00:50:55,720
I don't want anybody...

729
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:57,263
Let's drink.

730
00:51:01,934 --> 00:51:03,186
Can I talk to you?

731
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:06,230
About what happened.

732
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:07,690
- Spit it out!
- I agree!

733
00:51:07,815 --> 00:51:10,067
Before anything...

734
00:51:10,234 --> 00:51:14,822
I invited the girls to go there,
and we went there to have a snack.

735
00:51:15,031 --> 00:51:17,283
- We treated her very well.
- Yes, I know.

736
00:51:17,784 --> 00:51:19,827
Everything was fine until then.

737
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,246
Put yourselves in her shoes.

738
00:51:22,872 --> 00:51:25,958
Put yourself in my shoes too.
It's very easy.

739
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:28,336
It was like Bia said, Renato.

740
00:51:28,461 --> 00:51:32,006
You could enjoy your last day with us.

741
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:33,841
Or with a nice girl.

742
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:36,844
- We took you in, welcomed you.
- Look...

743
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:40,389
- Listen...
- We just said that!

744
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:42,141
Okay, fine.

745
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:44,310
- Hold this, baby.
- But look...

746
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:47,522
Let me finish. You guys said,

747
00:51:47,647 --> 00:51:51,234
"Oh, they're gonna sleep
on the ground." They heard it.

748
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:54,028
- I said you'd sleep on the ground...
- No!

749
00:51:54,195 --> 00:51:57,031
- ...if you brought...
- No, you said the girls...

750
00:51:57,198 --> 00:51:59,283
You said they'd...

751
00:51:59,492 --> 00:52:01,035
Fine, but dude...

752
00:52:01,035 --> 00:52:04,080
- Guys, let him...
- ...you were invited to the place.

753
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:06,499
We took the boys to the box...

754
00:52:06,624 --> 00:52:10,795
You say you wouldn't accept an insult
and you'd do much worse.

755
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:14,090
What did I do to the girl
who said I was a whore?

756
00:52:15,049 --> 00:52:17,510
Don't I have the right to respond?

757
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:21,305
If I said... And you thought
I said it to you, I apologize.

758
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:26,102
I apologize for what happened,
but you have to understand me.

759
00:52:26,269 --> 00:52:30,773
Because she said I was a whore
and mocked me. It's not about Ítalo!

760
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:33,985
Was he involved? It was about him and her.

761
00:52:33,985 --> 00:52:36,195
- It was about him and her.
- Because...

762
00:52:36,362 --> 00:52:40,449
- I'm in our house, if she mocks me...
- ...look...

763
00:52:40,575 --> 00:52:42,785
- ...you have the...
- I defended Taynara

764
00:52:42,785 --> 00:52:45,538
- when they fought, Bia...
- ...you...

765
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:47,456
...they are my friends.

766
00:52:47,456 --> 00:52:49,709
You have the right to be pissed.

767
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:52,378
- Got it?
- Let it go!

768
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:54,922
I understand your side of the story.

769
00:52:55,631 --> 00:52:59,093
It's your last night, drink! Chug!

770
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:03,014
It's all settled. Look at the moon.

771
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:15,109
Here...

772
00:53:15,735 --> 00:53:18,070
He's very upset at you.

773
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:19,572
I know it.

774
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:23,159
Nobody is soft here, you know?

775
00:53:23,159 --> 00:53:27,663
I never said you couldn't be pissed
at them for calling you names.

776
00:53:27,788 --> 00:53:29,916
To me, everything happened...

777
00:53:30,625 --> 00:53:32,001
at that moment...

778
00:53:32,752 --> 00:53:37,298
when you said
the girls would sleep on the sand.

779
00:53:37,423 --> 00:53:39,216
I understand, I just wish...

780
00:53:39,383 --> 00:53:42,261
you had understood and prioritized us.

781
00:53:42,428 --> 00:53:43,930
Yes, bro, but...

782
00:53:44,055 --> 00:53:46,265
- But...
- I wish you had prioritized us.

783
00:53:46,432 --> 00:53:48,017
But it's because...

784
00:53:48,225 --> 00:53:52,271
She mocked me twice.
She couldn't take it and walked away.

785
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:54,398
I understand you guys.

786
00:53:55,942 --> 00:53:57,443
I'm cool.

787
00:53:57,902 --> 00:53:59,028
Me too.

788
00:54:07,787 --> 00:54:11,666
But that's over, that's cool, you know?

789
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:14,794
- I understand your side.
- I'm cool.

790
00:54:14,961 --> 00:54:18,172
- That's it. Let's have fun.
- Let's do it.

791
00:54:18,339 --> 00:54:21,300
I told Milena to sleep on this side.

792
00:54:22,176 --> 00:54:25,304
This is the couple's side,
this is the sing...

793
00:54:26,806 --> 00:54:30,518
"Mine," my ass,
I'm gonna sleep with Milena.

794
00:54:31,143 --> 00:54:33,062
Ítalo, wake up!

795
00:54:33,187 --> 00:54:36,440
Switch places with Milena,
that's the double bed, look.

796
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:39,235
Switch it, buddy, switch places.

797
00:54:48,703 --> 00:54:49,954
Last day.

798
00:54:53,207 --> 00:54:54,750
I said I'd be awake.

799
00:54:54,917 --> 00:54:56,836
- Thank you.
- I said I'd be awake.

800
00:54:57,962 --> 00:54:59,130
That's crazy.

801
00:55:01,090 --> 00:55:02,550
Fuck, look at the sun!

802
00:55:03,968 --> 00:55:05,136
Look at that!

803
00:55:16,439 --> 00:55:18,733
- Hey, Murilo!
- Hey, Mu!

804
00:55:19,692 --> 00:55:20,818
Look at that!

805
00:55:22,695 --> 00:55:24,155
Look at that size.

806
00:55:26,198 --> 00:55:27,616
It's Renato's last day!

807
00:55:29,994 --> 00:55:32,580
That's it, bro, always.

808
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,375
It's the best place to say goodbye!

809
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:38,085
Yes!

810
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:41,047
- Praia do Rosa, sunrise.
- Look at this sun, dude.

811
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:42,673
So blessed.

812
00:55:47,553 --> 00:55:48,637
The sun.

813
00:55:52,433 --> 00:55:54,143
Look who's coming.

814
00:55:54,435 --> 00:55:56,562
Fuck!

815
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:58,773
Fuck!

816
00:55:58,898 --> 00:56:00,316
Fuck! Just a kiss!

817
00:56:00,483 --> 00:56:02,026
A kiss!

818
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:07,364
That's a mistake.

819
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:09,075
It wasn't a kiss!

820
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:10,785
Get out of here!

821
00:56:17,917 --> 00:56:20,211
I'm gonna miss Renatinho!

822
00:56:20,461 --> 00:56:24,298
I think each one of them had...

823
00:56:25,466 --> 00:56:27,468
something to stand for.

824
00:56:27,468 --> 00:56:32,848
Renatinho wanted to get lucky
with the girls on his last day!

825
00:56:32,973 --> 00:56:38,020
It didn't happen because of that mess
that happened with Ítalo and the girl.

826
00:56:38,229 --> 00:56:44,110
Renatinho got upset...
but I also understand her side...

827
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:49,073
because, imagine the atmosphere
if she went to the camp, you know?

828
00:56:49,448 --> 00:56:51,408
I understand both sides.

829
00:56:51,575 --> 00:56:55,996
I think Renatinho rushed things
and ended up with nothing.

830
00:56:56,122 --> 00:56:58,624
He invited all those people,

831
00:56:58,624 --> 00:57:01,293
- and nothing happened!
- But he had sex a lot!

832
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,003
He's forgiven!

833
00:57:03,003 --> 00:57:05,297
- That's his day.
- Yes, it's cool.

834
00:57:05,297 --> 00:57:10,261
Nothing better than that goodbye, right?
With that sun, the landscape, the friends.

835
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:12,429
This must be fucking awesome.

836
00:57:13,013 --> 00:57:18,310
You've seen it, the energy's running out.
I have a feeling I can't get enough of it.

837
00:57:18,561 --> 00:57:24,358
Girl, I have this feeling
since the first episode!

838
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:25,943
- Hit play!
- Honey!

839
00:57:28,696 --> 00:57:29,905
IN THE NEXT EPISODE

840
00:57:29,905 --> 00:57:33,534
Tonight is gonna be epic!

841
00:57:40,166 --> 00:57:42,960
Take it or leave it!
Fuck, do you know what it is?

842
00:57:43,085 --> 00:57:44,545
Getting off, my ass!

843
00:57:44,670 --> 00:57:45,963
What's this?

844
00:57:48,966 --> 00:57:49,967
Floripa!

845
00:57:54,430 --> 00:57:58,392
- Nath. What happened, man?
- They got everything off their chest.

846
00:57:58,392 --> 00:58:01,770
Damn, imagine,
we complimented Nath every day...

847
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:05,232
- Nath, don't do that!
- ...then, in the last episode...

848
00:58:05,232 --> 00:58:07,234
But we don't know what happened!

849
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:10,070
Sometimes, you feel like throwing drinks
at somebody.

850
00:58:10,070 --> 00:58:12,156
And once again, in the bus, right?

851
00:58:12,156 --> 00:58:13,574
Damn, what a vacation!

852
00:58:13,574 --> 00:58:16,952
Let's go, buddy, let's go.

853
00:58:17,203 --> 00:58:19,205
Come, baby, stop it. Just today.

854
00:58:20,331 --> 00:58:23,083
- No, don't do this!
- What's this?

855
00:58:23,542 --> 00:58:26,754
Throw the drink in my mouth,
but don't throw it at me.

856
00:58:26,962 --> 00:58:28,297
He can really carry me.

857
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:30,257
I'll open my mouth.

858
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:33,135
John can carry 190 pounds, imagine...

859
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:35,179
You weigh...

860
00:58:35,387 --> 00:58:37,473
You weigh 190 pounds?
