00:00:05,047 --> 00:00:05,965

WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS 2
THE REVIEW

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,386
Everybody was dancing back there...

4
00:00:13,806 --> 00:00:15,015
I'll just clap.

5
00:00:17,393 --> 00:00:18,894
Hey... MC is missing.

6
00:00:18,894 --> 00:00:20,354
Listen to my English!

7
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:21,856
You missed class at CCAA

8
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:22,898
Get away

9
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:28,487
How are you, guys?

10
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:30,281
We're great!

11
00:00:30,573 --> 00:00:32,032
Great!

12
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:34,326
What is it? A drunk Colombian woman?

13
00:00:34,493 --> 00:00:37,329
Why is everybody speaking Spanish?

14
00:00:37,663 --> 00:00:40,374
Because my mood today's a Latin girl.

15
00:00:40,499 --> 00:00:43,127
- What?
- I'm a Latin girl today.

16
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:44,336
A Latin girl?

17
00:00:44,336 --> 00:00:48,591
Kisses to all
Wild and Free: Florianópolis fans

18
00:00:48,716 --> 00:00:52,052
from Latin America,
we love you a lot. Kisses!

19
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:54,263
Go!

20
00:00:55,431 --> 00:00:58,392
Everybody's anxious to see what's going on

21
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:00,144
in this episode?

22
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:01,979
Pregnancy, lots of stuff!

23
00:01:02,104 --> 00:01:04,190
- To me, pregnancy is...
- Guys!

24
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:06,567
There's this possible pregnancy!

25
00:01:06,776 --> 00:01:10,529
Remember that Renatinho arrived,
hooked up with everybody,

26
00:01:10,821 --> 00:01:14,241
hooked up with Anna.
Will this couple happen?

27
00:01:14,617 --> 00:01:17,119
They won't be a couple,
they'll make out a lot.

28
00:01:17,244 --> 00:01:18,662
I think so too.

29
00:01:18,829 --> 00:01:20,998
Anna was the last one I saw him with.

30
00:01:21,207 --> 00:01:23,125
I think Anna and Renatinho

31
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,504
learned they're free,
so they're a free couple.

32
00:01:26,754 --> 00:01:28,380
And they ended up having sex.

33
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,216
Oh, that's true!

34
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:31,842
Sex!

35
00:01:31,842 --> 00:01:33,552
He ended up with Anna, true!

36
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:37,181
He ended up with Anna.
What about Murilo and Tay?

37
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:39,975
Do you think it's really over?
What do you think?

38
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,771
I told you they learned
they have to be friends because

39
00:01:43,938 --> 00:01:47,483
when they see
each other with others they get...

40
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,402
I think as a couple they are good friends.

41
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:51,737
That's right, Titto.

42
00:01:51,737 --> 00:01:53,030
Now she's detached.

43
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:56,617
Guys, from the beginning
to the middle of that vacation...

44
00:01:56,784 --> 00:02:00,079
there were a lot of fights.
They need to be friends now.

45
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:03,082
They don't work well together nor apart.

46
00:02:03,374 --> 00:02:05,125
In my opinion, that couple,

47
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:07,503
especially Tay, can't take it anymore.

48
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:08,963
- Yeah.
- She's tired.

49
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:10,840
But Murilo's trying something.

50
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:13,259
- She's tired.
- So, are you ready?

51
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:15,594
Are you ready?

52
00:02:15,594 --> 00:02:17,012
Yes!

53
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,348
We are ready!

54
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:20,558
I have the remote!

55
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,351
Delicious!

56
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:23,936
Come, Christian Grey!

57
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:25,688
Let's go!

58
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:30,943
I don't like your sickness, girl.

59
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:32,653
I don't understand either.

60
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,822
Do you think you could be pregnant?

61
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:38,742
Fuck!

62
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:41,203
Oh, my God! No!

63
00:02:43,289 --> 00:02:46,542
Girl, we were afraid of Tay and Murilo...

64
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:49,545
- Guys, is it Luan's?
- Who would it be?

65
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:51,463
She only had sex with him.

66
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:52,882
Yes!

67
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,925
Luan left but he is still there.

68
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:56,552
But my rhythm method...

69
00:02:57,261 --> 00:03:00,681
My rhythm method says it's Luan's.

70
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:04,351
Fuck, it's a child,
in a relationship that doesn't exist!

71
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:05,895
Give the child to the dad.

72
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:07,229
In Floripa!

73
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:08,814
Give it to the dad!

74
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:10,065
I'd do it!

75
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,943
A baby in the belly? It's very creepy.

76
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:15,070
That's crazy, man.

77
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:19,658
I'd be very nervous,
I'd say, "Guys, cut. Camera, cut."

78
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,661
Lexa? Have you ever been through this?

79
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,455
Sure, guys!

80
00:03:24,622 --> 00:03:25,998
I've never had sex.

81
00:03:25,998 --> 00:03:28,626
- Being in doubt?
- The holy virgin is talking.

82
00:03:29,501 --> 00:03:34,590
I've been with Guimê for five years,
I had a few scares.

83
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,884
And I don't know how to explain.

84
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:38,218
What did you feel?

85
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:40,846
- What did you feel?
- I felt...

86
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,307
What happened was, look...
It scared me a lot.

87
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:46,268
- You were scared to death.
- Nothing happened. Nothing.

88
00:03:46,268 --> 00:03:47,394
And you, Carol?

89
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:51,023
My test was negative, just so you know.

90
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:54,234
So, guys, I use condom, you know?

91
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:57,947
But I once had some really crazy sex, bro.

92
00:03:58,948 --> 00:04:00,074
What?

93
00:04:00,074 --> 00:04:05,162
He was very crazy. When I realized
he wasn't wearing a condom,

94
00:04:05,329 --> 00:04:08,707
I said, "What's this?
Why did you do this?" But anyway...

95
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:11,210
I can't, Carol... Carol, I can't.

96
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,754
- Seriously, girl.
- How was it?

97
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:18,092
- The sex?
- No, I know how sex works...

98
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:22,513
How was the feeling after,
thinking you were pregnant?

99
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:26,225
Man, it was awful.
I called my friend Pataxó.

100
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,685
Hi, Pataxó.

101
00:04:27,893 --> 00:04:29,228
Is he Bumba's friend?

102
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:30,771
He's indigenous.

103
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,606
No, nobody likes Bumba.

104
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:35,526
- He steals chocolate, but...
- Just you...

105
00:04:35,985 --> 00:04:37,236
Then...

106
00:04:37,403 --> 00:04:40,155
There's "Bumba meu Boi",
hers is "Bumba meu boy".

107
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:42,199
"Bumba meu boy".

108
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:44,326
Then, it happened...

109
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,329
I was desperate,
called my friend and said,

110
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:51,291
"Pataxó, I think
you're gonna be an uncle."

111
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:54,378
Then I asked my friend
to buy the test secretly.

112
00:04:54,837 --> 00:04:57,756
I took the test
and I wasn't pregnant, thank God.

113
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,466
Everything's cool.

114
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:02,302
- And the dad?
- Who cares about a poor dad.

115
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:05,723
But if he were...

116
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:08,684
If he were rich...

117
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,686
it'd be totally different!

118
00:05:13,105 --> 00:05:16,650
Good afternoon. Hi.
I'd like a pregnancy test, please.

119
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:34,793
- Guys, they're making me nervous.
- I'm uptight.

120
00:05:35,794 --> 00:05:37,921
Bro, she's sweating.

121
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:40,674
I've never seen this in any other reality!

122
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:45,429
I've never seen this. That's bizarre!

123
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,975
I'll take the front seat.

124
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:51,727
Damn!

125
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:01,987
No way.

126
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,532
- I don't see a board.
- It's inside.

127
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,118
Let's take a look.

128
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,828
Do you have a big floaty?

129
00:06:10,079 --> 00:06:11,789
We had arranged...

130
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:14,750
Oh, not the flamingo!

131
00:06:17,336 --> 00:06:19,213
What a wonderful floaty!

132
00:06:19,421 --> 00:06:22,633
- Girl, everybody fits in it.
- Everybody!

133
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,178
I'd rather they do that
than fighting, so that's great.

134
00:06:27,346 --> 00:06:29,181
Put it on the high seas.

135
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,101
If God made it, we can carry it!

136
00:06:34,228 --> 00:06:38,148
Bro, imagine people driving by,
seeing that and saying, "Fuck,

137
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,734
"I think there's a mutant in town..."

138
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:44,571
That's unbelievable!
This scene is awesome!

139
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,158
Look at the traffic jam they're causing!

140
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:50,953
There's a fucking flamingo!

141
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,125
I loved it!

142
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:57,626
Let's not judge them!

143
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:58,919
I loved it!

144
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,589
Let's go!

145
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:04,133
Let's go!

146
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:09,638
Life's crazy, some of them
are having fun in the jam

147
00:07:09,805 --> 00:07:11,974
and others are solving big issues.

148
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:14,059
Her life might change after that.

149
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:15,602
They don't know about it.

150
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:19,022
I'm not saying her friends
didn't feel sympathy for her,

151
00:07:19,148 --> 00:07:24,736
I'm saying people's lives are different.
They are having fun and she's worried!

152
00:07:25,028 --> 00:07:27,364
- Not pregnant.
- Not pregnant.

153
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:30,159
- Phew, amen!
- Amen!

154
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,078
- I was scared like that.
- So was I.

155
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:38,041
That chick has just lifted a huge weight
off her shoulders, man.

156
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:41,211
- Exactly.
- Bia!

157
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:43,422
That's cool, she had a heavy burden.

158
00:07:43,589 --> 00:07:45,674
Heavy like...

159
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:49,052
the Corcovado in Rio de Janeiro, you know?

160
00:07:49,219 --> 00:07:54,808
I felt that way when I checked my grade
to see if I had passed a test at school.

161
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,060
The only time I felt that way.

162
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:02,357
No! It was when I said,
"John, your nudes leaked in three groups."

163
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,193
"What, buddy? What happened?"

164
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:06,820
John's nudes
have been leaked, that's true.

165
00:08:07,029 --> 00:08:08,989
- Just once.
- But it leaked.

166
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:13,202
Now people are gonna google it
and type "John's nudes" to see it!

167
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,334
Have you ever imagined
having sex on that flamingo?

168
00:08:20,459 --> 00:08:25,005
When I moved in to São Paulo, I spent
one week sleeping on an air mattress.

169
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:27,925
Having sex on an air mattress is bad,

170
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:31,428
I'm six feet and four inches tall
and my body, like a Miss...

171
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,722
- What did Nath say?
-"Miss-Chievous."

172
00:08:33,722 --> 00:08:37,184
Imagine my heavy body
on a floaty on the water!

173
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:41,230
What about you, Titto?
You and the chick are on the floaty.

174
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:44,733
Would you have sex or not?

175
00:08:44,858 --> 00:08:47,361
- Come on, Jerry!
- Say it, Titto.

176
00:08:47,361 --> 00:08:49,488
Answer the question!

177
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,406
I don't compromise myself.

178
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,908
I would!

179
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:54,993
Am I gonna say I wouldn't?

180
00:08:55,118 --> 00:08:56,787
I wouldn't!

181
00:08:56,995 --> 00:08:58,705
I'd, at least, play a little.

182
00:08:58,914 --> 00:09:02,793
Of course. If that carries ten people,
imagine this little body?

183
00:09:13,095 --> 00:09:15,013
- I have to talk to Anna.
- About?

184
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:17,766
There are some things that make me...

185
00:09:17,933 --> 00:09:20,727
- Like?
- She wants...

186
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:24,690
to do things in her own time, you know?

187
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,775
She does things in her own time.

188
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:30,654
He's acting like he was
the victim, my love.

189
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:35,325
At the bar, working,
he hooked up with a girl before her!

190
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,577
I wanna have fun, you know?

191
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,454
No, she hooked up before him.

192
00:09:40,497 --> 00:09:41,790
At the party.

193
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:45,919
But he talked about Nath too.

194
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:48,755
Oh, yeah, everybody's single.

195
00:09:49,047 --> 00:09:51,091
If something happens after this.

196
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:53,593
Ramon isn't
the best person to give advice.

197
00:09:53,802 --> 00:09:55,053
He just makes mistakes.

198
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:58,098
He really isn't the best one.

199
00:09:58,307 --> 00:09:59,683
He was the calmest guy.

200
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:03,353
But Ramon harmed Murilo
and Tay's relationship indirectly.

201
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,814
It's very difficult to understand you.

202
00:10:06,273 --> 00:10:08,442
- Why?
- Just because.

203
00:10:09,359 --> 00:10:13,071
Sometimes you show some things,
then all of a sudden, you change.

204
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:16,950
Sometimes, I think you wanna be with me.

205
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,495
All of a sudden, you don't.

206
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:23,123
It's a little difficult.

207
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:25,751
He's opening up.

208
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:29,212
- I like that.
- He's opening up.

209
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:30,672
I liked it.

210
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:34,343
Sometimes, you don't know
what you're saying when you're wasted.

211
00:10:34,593 --> 00:10:36,345
You just say it!

212
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,680
No, Mu, what happened there...

213
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,558
- You freaked out.
- No, I didn't.

214
00:10:41,767 --> 00:10:43,060
Stop it!

215
00:10:43,185 --> 00:10:45,687
He doesn't get it yet, seriously.

216
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,315
He looks like my connection, slow.

217
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:53,153
Let me tell you something,
that depends on Tay now,

218
00:10:53,362 --> 00:10:54,529
if she comes clean...

219
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:55,989
I like that talk.

220
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,991
But he's still talking

221
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:02,496
- and blaming her.
- I like the talk. He's talking calmly,

222
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:04,873
- opening up...
- If he were drunk...

223
00:11:04,998 --> 00:11:07,376
I feel Tay is unhappy about that talk.

224
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:09,628
She didn't express herself.

225
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,089
She barely reacted.

226
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:14,007
I think she has his vibe.

227
00:11:14,007 --> 00:11:15,175
She has the vibe...

228
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:16,718
- of just listening.
- Yes.

229
00:11:16,718 --> 00:11:19,304
- She's tired.
- She knows she's right.

230
00:11:19,304 --> 00:11:21,890
Deep down, a woman knows she's right.

231
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,225
That's it!

232
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:32,317
Thank God.

233
00:11:32,526 --> 00:11:34,027
Hey, John!

234
00:11:34,027 --> 00:11:35,320
I'd hook up with him!

235
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,947
Girl, and you?

236
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:38,323
Sure!

237
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:40,534
Fuck, bro!

238
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:41,451
Get a grip!

239
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,203
What's up?

240
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:45,038
How are you, bro?

241
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,957
Fuck, bro!

242
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:49,835
And you, Carol?

243
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:53,839
Girl, I didn't like one thing.

244
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,049
- What?
- His casual shoes.

245
00:11:56,299 --> 00:11:57,968
Those masculine casual shoes?

246
00:11:58,802 --> 00:12:01,054
Who would notice casual shoes?

247
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:03,306
I would!

248
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:05,600
Carol didn't even see he had legs...

249
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:07,811
No, buddy, he's super straight.

250
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,479
I noticed...

251
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:13,733
He looks like he's been raised
by his grandmother, you know?

252
00:12:13,859 --> 00:12:15,986
I'd hook up with him because...

253
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:19,072
I think he studied engineering in college.

254
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,910
Look, Andrei!

255
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,704
Her guy!

256
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:29,332
Do you think Nath
will continue to hook up with him?

257
00:12:29,875 --> 00:12:32,335
- Dude, I think so.
- Me too.

258
00:12:32,461 --> 00:12:35,672
She enjoyed that guy's vibe!

259
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:39,551
Nath's barely making out,
when she does, she does it with him.

260
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:41,845
I think he was cute going there.

261
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:43,305
Me too.

262
00:12:43,305 --> 00:12:47,934
I think she'll begin to make out with him
and fight because of him.

263
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,020
If I were a waitress like that,

264
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,733
I'd love to see my guy
watching me working, man.

265
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:58,278
I think they're in a mature relationship,
Murilo and Tay.

266
00:12:59,488 --> 00:13:01,990
I mean, too mature.

267
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:03,283
She invited him.

268
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,370
He did like those gossipers.

269
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:09,539
Anna wants to take a guy home,

270
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,833
she'll perform a fatality in Renatinho.

271
00:13:11,833 --> 00:13:14,336
Murilo wasn't expecting it.

272
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:17,756
The best scene is Murilo's,
the scenic Murilo.

273
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:20,467
Murilo's like my gossiping friends.

274
00:13:27,599 --> 00:13:29,392
It's Renato... Is it that girl?

275
00:13:31,853 --> 00:13:33,230
How's the joke?

276
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,902
Fuck, Tay. Listen!

277
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:41,321
Oh, girl, I won't listen, girl.

278
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:43,365
It hurts, I know.

279
00:13:43,949 --> 00:13:45,742
"It hurts, I know."

280
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,869
And Murilo is by her side!

281
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:49,913
Meaning, she likes him!

282
00:13:49,913 --> 00:13:53,583
I thought it was crazy,
because I thought she was totally free,

283
00:13:53,792 --> 00:13:55,961
but... she's not!

284
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:59,089
I don't think she likes Renatinho.

285
00:13:59,214 --> 00:14:00,382
Come on!

286
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:01,925
She's crying because...

287
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:06,721
I think she invented
an imaginary rule in her head,

288
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,015
and he crossed this line!

289
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:10,976
You don't believe that!

290
00:14:11,101 --> 00:14:14,020
No, it's difficult for "Dr." John Drops.

291
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:16,523
Guys, it's obvious, she's upset.

292
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,067
She's hurt, but I thought she was free.

293
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:20,318
I agree.

294
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:23,071
Hearing your ex having sex like this...

295
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:24,364
must be frustrating!

296
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:28,577
I think she's upset because of her "F.B.",
not because of him!

297
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:30,287
- What's "F.B."?
- Fuck buddy.

298
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:31,496
It's...

299
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:33,164
- John's theory!
- I agree!

300
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:37,377
She had a permanent "F.B." in the house...

301
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,462
- I agree.
- ...but outside they

302
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:43,049
could do whatever they wanted.
But he took the girl home.

303
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,092
And she's hurt.

304
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:47,554
She doesn't like the guy, just his dick!

305
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,056
- What?
- She doesn't like the guy!

306
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,434
- What?
- She just likes his dick!

307
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,103
That's it! She likes fucking him!

308
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:58,315
If she could detach his dick,
she'd take it?

309
00:14:58,565 --> 00:14:59,899
Exactly!

310
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:04,070
Before hitting play, I wanna hear
somebody who almost said nothing.

311
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,781
- What?
- What do you think

312
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,950
about this situation?

313
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:13,997
If I were in her shoes,
I would handle it differently.

314
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:17,459
I'd just say, "I don't care."
I would let the guy fuck

315
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:19,210
and I'd be cool.

316
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:23,048
Or I'd do like Anna, hook up
and leave, but I think I would stay.

317
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:25,884
I wonder if we are too detached.

318
00:15:25,884 --> 00:15:30,430
Oh, girl, I don't believe those things,
that, "We're all detached."

319
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:33,975
- Sometimes here, I pretend I am...
- You are!

320
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,227
...but deep inside, I also am.

321
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,605
You can't be totally detached, man.

322
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:42,567
Pabllo is the most detached person
I've ever met. For real!

323
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:44,527
I'm gonna hit play!

324
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:47,030
- Let's go!
- Play!

325
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:51,451
Someone wants to use it. Nath!

326
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:53,244
Turn around now.

327
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,039
- Look. She's testing.
- Fuck!

328
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:57,499
That's not possible.

329
00:15:57,499 --> 00:15:59,459
Look at this, Ramon.

330
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,544
What about that woman? Hell yeah.

331
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,505
Wonderful.

332
00:16:03,755 --> 00:16:05,465
"Look at this, Ramon"?

333
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,008
Go have sex, sister.

334
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,177
Wait! Rewind it!

335
00:16:09,177 --> 00:16:11,221
She's showing it to Ramon!

336
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:15,350
She's making sexual advances
on Ramon! Is it him there?

337
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,394
- It's Renatinho. Ramon?
- Yeah!

338
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,104
And Renatinho with...

339
00:16:19,229 --> 00:16:21,481
It's Ramon!

340
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:24,359
Fuck, it's Ramon, man.

341
00:16:24,859 --> 00:16:27,278
But I think it's very clear to Ramon.

342
00:16:27,404 --> 00:16:29,239
That is...

343
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:30,323
#YOULOSTRAMON

344
00:16:30,448 --> 00:16:32,075
And Ramon's like that...

345
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,119
That's resilience, man.

346
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:37,372
Vanessinha is awesome.

347
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:40,041
Fuck, Ramon's taking pictures!

348
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,835
He took the picture!

349
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:44,629
- Guys, what's the problem?
- He was cool.

350
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:46,005
Yes, for God's sake!

351
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:48,717
Andrei!

352
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:50,427
Hey, man, what a shame.

353
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:52,971
Everybody got in the bedroom?

354
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:06,276
Where are yesterday's pictures?

355
00:17:06,443 --> 00:17:08,528
Put them here.

356
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:11,406
I threw our picture away.

357
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:12,449
Fuck!

358
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:14,284
Throw these away too!

359
00:17:14,409 --> 00:17:15,452
Why?

360
00:17:15,618 --> 00:17:17,328
Throw them away!

361
00:17:17,495 --> 00:17:18,788
Who threw it away?

362
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:22,083
Murilo's looking for trouble,
he wants to fight.

363
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,335
They're nitpicking, huh, man?

364
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:26,296
What an angry girl.

365
00:17:26,504 --> 00:17:28,506
Why did she do that?

366
00:17:28,715 --> 00:17:32,093
Because she's tired, girl. Tay's tired!

367
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,553
But she took the bait.

368
00:17:36,514 --> 00:17:38,641
- I'm fine.
- No, you're not.

369
00:17:38,767 --> 00:17:41,144
I was talking to you, and you...

370
00:17:41,603 --> 00:17:44,314
I was really quiet. I don't know.

371
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:46,191
I don't know!

372
00:17:46,191 --> 00:17:48,985
Guys, they're attracted to each other.

373
00:17:49,110 --> 00:17:52,071
She knows she can't demand
anything from him.

374
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,990
I like his mouth.

375
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,451
- That's a trigger warning!
- Yes!

376
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:59,329
- I'm here looking at his mouth.
- I'm serious.

377
00:17:59,329 --> 00:18:02,540
- Me too!
- I get you. I understand you.

378
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:03,875
I'm serious!

379
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:05,251
I want him!

380
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:08,922
That's not worth it, you know?

381
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:10,507
I made a mistake.

382
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:12,467
She's very sensible.

383
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:14,469
I love Anna!

384
00:18:14,594 --> 00:18:16,846
She gets straight to the point.

385
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,389
She's very honest.

386
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:20,475
Anna's here, look.

387
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,853
Anna's way too evolved,

388
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:25,522
and Rena... Can I say it?

389
00:18:25,522 --> 00:18:27,857
She admitted that it bothers her, girl.

390
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:31,653
It's an honest relationship,
and he talked to her.

391
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,239
They are starting to do this now.

392
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:38,618
He said, "We can start talking
what's allowed and what's not allowed."

393
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:39,869
He said it now!

394
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:43,540
- Let's establish something.
- They've always been honest.

395
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,375
They didn't get drunk before!

396
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,210
They're cool, talking.

397
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,837
That's the honest couple.

398
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:50,964
The most evolved couple there!

399
00:18:51,089 --> 00:18:53,550
That's what I was gonna say. I think.

400
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:54,634
I agree!

401
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:56,636
The most evolved couple.

402
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,389
I think that's a reflection
of other couples.

403
00:18:59,389 --> 00:19:01,850
They see things and wanna be different.

404
00:19:02,016 --> 00:19:03,810
We'll want to kiss others.

405
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:06,062
We won't avoid this.

406
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,690
Like it or not!

407
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:10,316
I'm sorry for us!

408
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:12,360
- That's it!
- Fuck!

409
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:16,114
Anna nailed it in this season!

410
00:19:16,489 --> 00:19:19,409
She nailed it big time.

411
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:21,494
What am I gonna do? There's no way.

412
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:25,039
- That's it!
- Honest talk.

413
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:26,791
Honest talk!

414
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:31,421
Jeez, I would fuck him,
you see, my sister?

415
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,256
Everything's all right.

416
00:19:33,256 --> 00:19:34,591
What do you think?

417
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:36,009
I give it up for her!

418
00:19:36,009 --> 00:19:38,261
I give him too, a lot of things.

419
00:19:39,846 --> 00:19:42,682
- Wonderful!
- What about you, Carol?

420
00:19:43,057 --> 00:19:44,976
Why, didn't you like it?

421
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:47,395
She said they should mind their business.

422
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,772
He laughed.

423
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:52,734
When the dick's good,
there's nowhere to run.

424
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:55,987
He was just being charming, Carol.

425
00:19:56,154 --> 00:19:59,407
Nobody, absolutely nobody.

426
00:19:59,407 --> 00:20:00,909
Carol, bro.

427
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,201
You know what's worse?

428
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:04,370
I feel like cuddling her.

429
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:06,497
I believe Carol's fanfics.

430
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:09,500
It took me a while to love Anna
because of Carol.

431
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:11,753
Guys!

432
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:14,589
Oh, my makeup!

433
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,799
Guys, Ray and my gay friend are here.

434
00:20:18,051 --> 00:20:19,218
Your gay friend!

435
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:21,471
I missed a gay friend there!

436
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:22,889
I missed a gay friend.

437
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:25,475
They needed a gay friend there.

438
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:27,101
I agree!

439
00:20:27,101 --> 00:20:29,103
Watch out, Matheus hits on them.

440
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,897
Now we're talking, Amazon.

441
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:33,066
- I loved it!
- We'll see a triple kiss.

442
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:34,442
I love it!

443
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,030
Let's see the gay friend,
let's see him nailing it.

444
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,365
I wanna see the gay!

445
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,408
The gay!

446
00:20:42,408 --> 00:20:44,452
I'm counting on him!

447
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,038
You go, girl, nail it!

448
00:20:54,504 --> 00:20:56,214
You know, right?

449
00:20:56,673 --> 00:20:59,759
- I'm already loving the gay guy!
- I loved him!

450
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,678
I love gays who do that.

451
00:21:01,886 --> 00:21:04,138
Matheus, love you, girl.

452
00:21:04,347 --> 00:21:05,682
You're slaying it.

453
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:08,851
We fuck for free. Line up and come,
one at a time, baby.

454
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:12,105
I love this gay!

455
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,399
"Line up and come, one at a time."

456
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,736
I love that gay.
Next time, it's gonna be me.

457
00:21:18,736 --> 00:21:20,405
I loved him!

458
00:21:20,571 --> 00:21:22,740
Line up and come, one at a time

459
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,242
I love him!

460
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:26,536
Gays are always there for you, right?

461
00:21:26,536 --> 00:21:29,414
Interacting with girls,
saying, "Man, that guy!"

462
00:21:29,664 --> 00:21:32,291
We know how to choose, girl!

463
00:21:32,417 --> 00:21:34,794
Girl, I loved it!

464
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:42,301
Don't do what they say!

465
00:21:42,677 --> 00:21:44,345
Don't drink it, you'll die!

466
00:21:44,554 --> 00:21:45,722
You'll die!

467
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:48,016
They're dangerous.

468
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:51,352
Nath's already gotten a guy, my love.

469
00:21:53,396 --> 00:21:55,982
But she was stuck to Andrei, wasn't she?

470
00:21:56,232 --> 00:21:59,610
I think she wasn't that stuck, right?

471
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,571
Andrei's here, where's Nath?

472
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:03,072
Andrei's here!

473
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:05,700
I love that partnership!

474
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:07,118
Andrei's here.

475
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:09,412
Oh, my God!

476
00:22:10,538 --> 00:22:12,081
I love that partnership!

477
00:22:12,248 --> 00:22:14,125
I think there's gonna be a mess!

478
00:22:14,500 --> 00:22:15,877
- You think?
- Yes!

479
00:22:16,044 --> 00:22:17,462
I'm sure!

480
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:19,505
Jeez!

481
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:23,134
Look at Anna pretending
she didn't know he was there!

482
00:22:23,134 --> 00:22:25,136
Nath's awesome.

483
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,473
She hooked up with that guy.

484
00:22:28,639 --> 00:22:31,059
Notice the difference

485
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:34,103
of a girl in a situation...
Look. Hit pause.

486
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:36,856
A girl in the same situation as Renatinho.

487
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:41,277
Renatinho was desperate.
Nath didn't give a shit, she hugged...

488
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:44,113
No, you can notice
the tension in her eyes.

489
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:47,784
Renatinho was in danger.
Renatinho would've shit his pants!

490
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:50,036
Nath talked!

491
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:51,746
She talked!

492
00:22:51,746 --> 00:22:53,748
She's tense, I could see that.

493
00:22:54,082 --> 00:22:56,876
She's tense, but she's not
as shocked as Renatinho.

494
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,252
It's because she is...

495
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:00,379
- already wasted.
- She hung in there!

496
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:04,425
The muse of this season,
this vacation, is Nath.

497
00:23:04,425 --> 00:23:07,887
Nath is from Goiânia.
She's a straightforward woman.

498
00:23:08,679 --> 00:23:11,557
There's no bullshit with her.

499
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,768
It's just us.

500
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,688
Hit pause, please!

501
00:23:17,939 --> 00:23:19,899
Some random guy showed up,

502
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,609
"It's just us."

503
00:23:21,609 --> 00:23:23,861
I know, no... It's all or nothing.

504
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:27,406
You know that party
where everybody hooks up with each other,

505
00:23:27,657 --> 00:23:30,284
like, "Lexa, it's just us, let's do it?"

506
00:23:30,535 --> 00:23:32,078
I'm like this.

507
00:23:33,955 --> 00:23:36,457
Tay kissed the guy.

508
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:41,212
I applaud Nath with my feet,

509
00:23:41,337 --> 00:23:43,422
laid down, doing somersaults.

510
00:23:43,548 --> 00:23:45,550
I think Nath was fucking awesome.

511
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,469
Nath, you named this episode, I'm shocked!

512
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:49,637
Queen of Goiânia.

513
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:51,806
Tay also was free there.

514
00:23:52,014 --> 00:23:57,895
I think, for her,
it's over for her and Murilo.

515
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:00,273
- For quite a while.
- I don't think so.

516
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:02,316
- I think so.
- I think it's over...

517
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:03,901
It's over and she got it.

518
00:24:03,901 --> 00:24:05,528
Anna liked her guy too.

519
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:07,780
Guys, Anna is making out.

520
00:24:07,989 --> 00:24:10,283
Will she take that guy home?

521
00:24:10,408 --> 00:24:12,326
Anna's on the loose!

522
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:14,453
Anna has poetic license.

523
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,623
Tay too, because she and Murilo said,

524
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:21,377
"Pretend I don't know you, it's over,
that's it!"

525
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:23,045
That's what I think.

526
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:28,050
I think the girls will take many guys home

527
00:24:28,426 --> 00:24:32,638
and the boys are gonna be insecure...

528
00:24:32,805 --> 00:24:36,017
We're gonna see
what their reactions will be.

529
00:24:36,184 --> 00:24:37,852
- Say it, Carol.
- My opinion.

530
00:24:38,352 --> 00:24:39,979
It's my opinion.

531
00:24:39,979 --> 00:24:42,982
When I am hooking up with a lot of guys,

532
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:48,696
actually, I'm feeling sad.

533
00:24:48,946 --> 00:24:50,239
No!

534
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:53,201
And I'm doing this because...

535
00:24:53,784 --> 00:24:56,078
To make it up for the need inside you.

536
00:24:56,078 --> 00:24:58,039
Exactly. In the end...

537
00:24:58,414 --> 00:24:59,999
I feel worse!

538
00:25:00,124 --> 00:25:01,792
Sad, but horny.

539
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:05,421
For example, I hooked up
with three guys in 48 hours.

540
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,716
What about Jerry? How many girls?

541
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:10,509
I think Tay,

542
00:25:10,718 --> 00:25:13,846
I think Tay doesn't want anybody,
doesn't like anybody,

543
00:25:13,971 --> 00:25:16,933
she wants to take revenge

544
00:25:17,266 --> 00:25:19,936
on something that made her sad.

545
00:25:20,436 --> 00:25:22,772
I think she's gonna end up with Murilo.

546
00:25:22,772 --> 00:25:24,607
I stand for that couple...

547
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:27,401
I can't believe she's taking revenge.

548
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:29,320
If she were taking revenge,

549
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:32,031
she'd kiss a guy at another party

550
00:25:32,281 --> 00:25:33,449
in front of Murilo.

551
00:25:33,699 --> 00:25:35,660
This is what we do!

552
00:25:35,826 --> 00:25:39,080
You sum up. I wanna know
your overview, Carol.

553
00:25:39,205 --> 00:25:42,166
You don't need to take revenge
directly on a person.

554
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:45,086
- She explained that!
- Could be indirectly.

555
00:25:45,294 --> 00:25:47,505
But the girls would never tell Murilo.

556
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:52,760
Sometimes we think that if we hook up
with 30 guys, we'll forget that one!

557
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:55,638
What about when you just wanna have sex?

558
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:57,390
I don't go to parties!

559
00:25:57,515 --> 00:26:00,768
- Where do you go?
- I make a phone call!

560
00:26:00,977 --> 00:26:02,812
But you go out to pick up guys!

561
00:26:02,937 --> 00:26:05,481
I don't go to parties to pick up guys!

562
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:07,608
- I go out late at night...
- Late?

563
00:26:07,775 --> 00:26:09,568
What time do you pick up girls?

564
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,989
Carol, tell me, it's late at night,
I'm very horny,

565
00:26:13,114 --> 00:26:14,782
what do I do to pick up guys?

566
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:16,367
To pick up guys...

567
00:26:17,535 --> 00:26:20,997
I take a shower
and wear a lot of Prada to fuck.

568
00:26:24,667 --> 00:26:28,296
- Wonderful!
-"I wear a lot of Prada to fuck."

569
00:26:28,546 --> 00:26:30,172
I loved it!

570
00:26:30,339 --> 00:26:33,426
Are you anxious to know
what's gonna happen?

571
00:26:33,426 --> 00:26:35,720
I'm almost dying here!

572
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,140
I'm very anxious. I think Tay's sad.

573
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:40,391
- No!
- Yeah, right!

574
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:41,892
Kissing a lot of men.

575
00:26:41,892 --> 00:26:43,686
And she'll look for Murilo

576
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:47,064
because she loves him and he loves her!

577
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:48,816
Here, to Murilo and Tay.

578
00:26:48,816 --> 00:26:50,484
What do you think?

579
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:55,239
I think she's fine.
I believe she can score three points.

580
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:57,533
- You wish you were her, right?
- Sure!

581
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:59,994
But if later she wants Murilo, no problem!

582
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:01,954
No problem!

583
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,497
Hit play!

584
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:04,999
Let's see it!

585
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:06,292
ON THE NEXT EPISODE

586
00:27:06,292 --> 00:27:08,919
You don't know what will happen...

587
00:27:09,045 --> 00:27:10,504
What's that, Murilo?

588
00:27:10,713 --> 00:27:12,548
Oh, my God!

589
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,637
Go, naughty girl

590
00:27:19,096 --> 00:27:21,974
I'm a very big girl!

591
00:27:25,603 --> 00:27:26,687
Hi...

592
00:27:33,152 --> 00:27:35,154
Where's her chocolate milk?
