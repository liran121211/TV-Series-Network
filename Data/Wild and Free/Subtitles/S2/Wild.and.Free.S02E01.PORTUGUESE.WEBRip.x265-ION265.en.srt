1
00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:07,842
- I'm here.
- It'll begin.

2
00:00:07,842 --> 00:00:10,594
I've missed you guys.

3
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:13,264
You're spitting in the back of my head.

4
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:18,227
My God, such an upgrade, Mrs. Prime Video.

5
00:00:18,352 --> 00:00:19,979
It's beautiful, right?

6
00:00:20,229 --> 00:00:21,981
- Great.
- Such an evolution.

7
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:25,776
- I'm shocked.
- I'm anxious for the second season.

8
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:30,448
Last summer I was on Titto's lap.
Now I'm here.

9
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:34,285
Thank God. I said I'd only come back
if we were far apart.

10
00:00:34,285 --> 00:00:40,332
I'm very happy to be here with my friends
and watch the second season.

11
00:00:40,624 --> 00:00:44,086
We brought in two backups
who I really love.

12
00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:46,964
My wonderful friend Lexa,

13
00:00:46,964 --> 00:00:49,884
and my baby Jerry Smith.

14
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:54,472
- Girl, ready for the action?
- Friend, I totally am.

15
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:57,141
You're not ready for it.

16
00:00:57,266 --> 00:01:02,271
- Just the way I like it.
- Jerry, ever been to Floripa?

17
00:01:03,272 --> 00:01:04,857
- Yes.
- Yes?

18
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:09,445
Not to Floripa,
I've had good times in Santa Catarina.

19
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:12,740
- Why did you go there?
- Do you like videogames?

20
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:15,951
"Do you like videogames?"

21
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:20,080
She said it's her seduction strategy.

22
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,626
She invites the boys
to play videogames and attacks.

23
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:26,003
I saw the first season.

24
00:01:26,003 --> 00:01:28,756
As you can see,
our living room has changed.

25
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:33,677
We are following all
the health authorities' COVID guidelines.

26
00:01:33,677 --> 00:01:39,225
But Titto is devastated.
He thought he'd seduce me this season.

27
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:43,103
Save it for next season.
We can exchange some nude pics.

28
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:46,273
- What's this bullshit?
- Are you sending nudes, Carol?

29
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,275
- No.
- Receiving any?

30
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:50,444
- So, so.
- I don't do that.

31
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:55,199
- What's with the face, Lexa?
- I want to know all the gossip.

32
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:59,078
I get nudes anytime I want,
I've got my go-to guy.

33
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:04,166
Girls, I'm anxious to find out
what they've done this summer in Floripa.

34
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:08,087
I miss being able to gather
and snuggle up to people. Right, Titto?

35
00:02:08,504 --> 00:02:09,755
Yeah, I miss it.

36
00:02:09,755 --> 00:02:14,969
Remember, they are not actors.
It's real life, anything can happen.

37
00:02:14,969 --> 00:02:17,721
Let's stop talking and play the episode?

38
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:19,932
- Yes, let's.
- Let's go!

39
00:02:19,932 --> 00:02:22,017
One, two, three. Go, Brazil!

40
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:26,230
A FEW MONTHS EARLIER...

41
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,732
- Shut up, man!
- You sexist!

42
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:31,735
We have no limits here.
We're blasting it out.

43
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:39,201
- Girlfriend, Ramon has company.
- In my bed?

44
00:02:40,494 --> 00:02:44,874
If you're fucking me,
you won't talk like this

45
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:48,919
- with one of my friends.
- I wish I hadn't met you.

46
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:51,046
If you can't handle it, fuck off.

47
00:02:51,046 --> 00:02:54,925
"Aren't you falling for her?"
He said, "Not at all."

48
00:02:56,010 --> 00:03:00,180
I'll beat up one or the other.
That's the way shit works.

49
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:02,516
- No, no.
- Calm down.

50
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:05,978
You're a show-off, brother.

51
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:09,023
Piece of shit!

52
00:03:12,234 --> 00:03:18,240
THIS SUMMER

53
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:37,217
DEPARTURES - ARRIVALS

54
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,113
Look at her!

55
00:03:59,198 --> 00:04:01,283
Girlfriends!

56
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,827
I've missed you.

57
00:04:04,662 --> 00:04:06,413
Hey!

58
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:18,676
You look great!

59
00:04:18,801 --> 00:04:21,720
Look at that tan! You look so thin!

60
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,226
- Girlfriend, you look so thin!
- You look amazing, like always.

61
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,521
- Back to the game.
- Where's the booze?

62
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:32,690
- Booze!
- Shots!

63
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:46,286
- Where's Blondie?
- I don't know. She sent an audio.

64
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,706
Hey, Tay. How's it going?

65
00:04:48,706 --> 00:04:53,544
I couldn't get off work in São Paulo,
so I can't join you.

66
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:56,338
Have lots of fun for me.

67
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:58,882
- Say hello to everyone.
- Seriously?

68
00:04:58,882 --> 00:05:02,052
I want you to rock. Kisses, bye!

69
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:03,345
Fuck.

70
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:07,016
- What are we doing without her?
- How could she not come?

71
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:09,685
- Awful.
- Thankfully, Anna is coming,

72
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:12,021
or our team would be shorthanded.

73
00:05:12,146 --> 00:05:17,818
- The team would be depleted without Anna.
- Anna is cool and likes funk music.

74
00:05:17,818 --> 00:05:20,112
Big blond hair.

75
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:22,031
- She's blonde!
- Yeah!

76
00:05:22,031 --> 00:05:24,533
- That's right.
- We should tell her that.

77
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:28,287
"We're replacing you,
because you didn't come, bitch."

78
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:38,422
- Friend, how are you and Mu?
- Girl, we broke up.

79
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:41,425
Murilo had a few bouts of jealousy,

80
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,886
that really put me off.

81
00:05:43,886 --> 00:05:48,182
He started acting like...
What really drove me to break up,

82
00:05:48,182 --> 00:05:52,644
was that he was going to come to Sorocaba,
but cancelled for the third time.

83
00:05:52,936 --> 00:05:54,563
Not cool, I'm no idiot.

84
00:05:55,522 --> 00:05:57,232
We never spoke again.

85
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,777
-"Bye bye forever."
- Other priorities.

86
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:02,071
How are you and Ramonzinho?

87
00:06:02,404 --> 00:06:06,116
- Ramon and I are good friends.
- Are you hooking up?

88
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,202
I think not. I hope not.

89
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,704
"I think not."

90
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,998
- She is not sure.
- I agree.

91
00:06:13,248 --> 00:06:15,167
- This "I think not"...
- Yeah.

92
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:19,213
I didn't buy it.
But don't cry over him, for God's sake.

93
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:22,966
- None of us.
- If you cry over him... No, I can.

94
00:06:22,966 --> 00:06:24,635
I won't cry over him.

95
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:27,513
Bia, what will happen with you and Luan?

96
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:30,891
- I don't wanna get involved.
- Look, guys,

97
00:06:30,891 --> 00:06:33,519
I'd rather not talk about it now.

98
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:36,188
There's a lot to tell.

99
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:40,651
- Really?
- So much, I don't know where to begin.

100
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:43,862
- We'll talk later.
- Are you single now...

101
00:06:43,987 --> 00:06:46,949
- Yes, I'm single.
- All right.

102
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:50,327
- One for all...
- And all for one!

103
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,110
- I missed this.
- We're here!

104
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:27,322
Guys, it looks awesome!

105
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:30,576
- Look at this entrance.
- Our little house.

106
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:42,754
- The good daughters return.
- Let's start from here.

107
00:07:42,754 --> 00:07:45,048
I'll hop on one leg.

108
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,676
It's here, right?

109
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:51,138
It's here. Let's scream together.

110
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:54,850
One for all, and all for one.

111
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:57,603
We're here.

112
00:07:57,811 --> 00:07:59,980
- Look at the bunny.
- A little bunny!

113
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:03,525
- Gotta have the bunny.
- Guys, I've missed this.

114
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:06,445
- Look what's on our deck.
- What?

115
00:08:06,612 --> 00:08:09,072
Damn!

116
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:12,034
- Man!
- That's where I'll sleep.

117
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:14,661
That's where we'll sleep.

118
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:22,169
- This is where everything started.
- Yes. Now, new stories...

119
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:28,217
This is where it started,
where Bia first kissed Luan.

120
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:32,763
- Murilo and I had made out.
- Five minutes later, it was a mess.

121
00:08:33,472 --> 00:08:39,436
- What happened between you two?
- After we left,

122
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:45,192
- we talked, you know.
- You said you'd talk.

123
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:50,948
He went to Santos, I went to Vitória,
we tried to stay together.

124
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:56,411
The distance was a problem
and a lot happened

125
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,081
that we both didn't like.

126
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:01,750
- That's it.
- Relationships are hard.

127
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,628
Both must really want it.

128
00:09:04,753 --> 00:09:09,007
It's hard enough in the same city,
long distance is even harder.

129
00:09:16,932 --> 00:09:20,018
- Hey!
- Someone want a drink?

130
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,396
- Finally!
- Hey!

131
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:24,064
Welcome!

132
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:26,942
Give me that.

133
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:29,111
Glad to see me or the bottle?

134
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,738
- Both!
- How are you?

135
00:09:31,738 --> 00:09:35,659
- Making an entrance.
- I'll open it.

136
00:09:35,659 --> 00:09:37,286
This is beautiful.

137
00:09:38,287 --> 00:09:41,665
- Come on, guys.
- A toast!

138
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:46,003
- To a perfect vacation.
- Wait up. We have...

139
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:50,090
our war cry,
"One for all, and all for one."

140
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,551
- Please, guys.
- One for all...

141
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:55,721
And all for one.

142
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:04,271
It's the guys. That's Murilo.

143
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:07,607
- Wonderful!
- We're here.

144
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:10,360
Look at Ramon...

145
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:13,238
Who wants to see them? I don't.

146
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,866
I missed you, Floripa!

147
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:18,827
Stepping in with the right foot.

148
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:23,123
It's ours!

149
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,917
- This is the life!
- I've missed it!

150
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:30,005
- Where's little João?
- Where's João?

151
00:10:30,172 --> 00:10:32,549
- Hey.
- Hello!

152
00:10:32,549 --> 00:10:35,177
- I'm in. I told you.
- Hey, Mu.

153
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:39,598
- How are you? Great.
- Okay, you?

154
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:41,975
- How are you?
- Hey, handsome.

155
00:10:41,975 --> 00:10:44,478
- How's it going?
- Cool, you?

156
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:47,773
- All good?
- I've missed you.

157
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:51,068
- Me too.
- You haven't.

158
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:53,070
You smell great.

159
00:10:53,070 --> 00:10:55,530
- You're shivering.
- Of course.

160
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:05,957
Things are getting serious now!

161
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:09,378
I want to see everyone fucking wasted!

162
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,467
- Thanks, man!
- Let's have a toast.

163
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:17,594
- All right!
- To Floripa...

164
00:11:17,719 --> 00:11:19,888
Yeah!

165
00:11:20,514 --> 00:11:23,141
- This summer will be sick!
- Yeah, man!

166
00:11:23,141 --> 00:11:24,935
Ice cubes falling!

167
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:28,313
I haven't drunk in a month
and I'll get shitfaced today.

168
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:31,149
We need a party in this house.

169
00:11:31,149 --> 00:11:36,696
- Lot's of after parties, drink every day.
- But what about João?

170
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:42,744
João is not coming, but let's have fun.
We are here to party!

171
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:46,206
- One for all...
- And all for one.

172
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:49,501
One for all, and all for one!

173
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:23,034
WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS 2

174
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:29,791
I want to know what we're doing today.

175
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:33,503
There's a party today on Daniela's Beach.

176
00:12:33,628 --> 00:12:36,256
- Awesome!
- Rocking it already!

177
00:12:36,256 --> 00:12:38,592
What will it be?

178
00:12:38,592 --> 00:12:41,970
Arriving with a bang. What is the plan?

179
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:47,058
The plan is to have a neon vibe
for us to get wild.

180
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:50,270
- Fuck yeah!
- Awesome!

181
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:17,380
You want to just get to it.

182
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:22,552
I won't hook up with her right away.
I want her to have fun.

183
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:27,933
The first time, she had less fun than me.
I don't want to be that guy.

184
00:13:28,183 --> 00:13:30,977
- Just have fun.
- That's right.

185
00:13:30,977 --> 00:13:33,813
Don't worry too much.

186
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:36,942
Just go with it.
The party today will be...

187
00:13:36,942 --> 00:13:40,028
- Just the first.
- The first of many.

188
00:13:55,794 --> 00:13:58,713
- I've missed this!
- I've missed it.

189
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:01,049
Look what's pulling up.

190
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,260
You missed this? Let's go!

191
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,845
- Let's go, man!
- Let's go!

192
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:09,516
- We're moving!
- The bus is here!

193
00:14:09,766 --> 00:14:12,644
- Awesome!
- There's history here.

194
00:14:13,144 --> 00:14:15,647
Let's go!

195
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:19,276
- Hey!
- It's here!

196
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:23,154
- I've missed it!
- Let's go!

197
00:14:23,363 --> 00:14:25,574
Awesome!

198
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:33,748
- Oh, man.
- Yeah.

199
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,334
It's hot here.

200
00:14:36,793 --> 00:14:40,338
- It's so hot, man!
- I'll sleep alone again, son of a bitch.

201
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:41,631
You won't.

202
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,648
Let's go!

203
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,597
- My nose!
- Did you get hurt?

204
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,099
- I've hurt my nose.
- Give me a kiss.

205
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,204
Floripa!

206
00:15:55,372 --> 00:15:59,793
One for all, and all for one!

207
00:16:09,219 --> 00:16:13,932
- Get your drink, kiss whoever you want.
- I am fine.

208
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:34,828
- I can't kiss you?
- No.

209
00:16:34,828 --> 00:16:37,080
- Why not?
- But I'd like to.

210
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,374
But you don't know why?

211
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,960
Because...

212
00:16:42,502 --> 00:16:44,462
I barely know you.

213
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:48,508
If we could only...

214
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,887
Can't you make an exception?

215
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,516
- No?
- I can't resist.

216
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,104
- Hey.
- What's your name?

217
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:04,816
- Pedro.
- Nice to meet you. This is Nath.

218
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:08,069
- I remember you!
- You remember?

219
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:10,655
Come on.

220
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:13,408
Nath is scheming this.

221
00:17:14,159 --> 00:17:16,077
What's your name again?

222
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,872
- Go, girlfriend!
- Take it.

223
00:17:19,456 --> 00:17:22,542
- Are you from here?
- Yes. You?

224
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,502
- Goiânia.
- Goiânia?

225
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:39,476
We're here, Floripa! Fuck!

226
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,936
- Yeah!
- Fuck!

227
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:45,190
Look at me. Do the hair thing.

228
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:50,195
Look at me. I think I bumped my arm.

229
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:51,613
I did.

230
00:17:54,199 --> 00:17:57,577
You smell great. I'm from here.

231
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:00,288
I'm from Brasília, but I live here.

232
00:18:00,455 --> 00:18:03,124
- I'm from Goiânia.
- From Goiânia?

233
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,919
Practically neighbors.

234
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,964
Look here.

235
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,050
What now?

236
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:15,386
Give me a kiss.

237
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:33,947
- Look at that.
- Oh, my God.

238
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,865
Where's my kiss?

239
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,201
- I need a drink.
- You are gorgeous.

240
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:39,661
Thank you.

241
00:18:43,373 --> 00:18:46,584
Just the girls.

242
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:49,838
Man, this picture will be sick!

243
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,132
What's that, Beatriz?

244
00:18:53,716 --> 00:18:57,637
- Fuck yeah!
- The pussy is showing.

245
00:18:57,762 --> 00:19:00,098
- Stop!
- Your pussy was showing.

246
00:19:00,098 --> 00:19:02,892
- Stop!
- Of course, such a big pussy.

247
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:06,980
Now just the boys. Give it to them.

248
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:09,440
Give them the camera.

249
00:19:10,483 --> 00:19:13,069
Your pussy is in the picture.

250
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,446
- Why didn't you cover it?
- Who am I?

251
00:19:15,446 --> 00:19:17,448
Why didn't you tell me?

252
00:19:17,574 --> 00:19:19,033
Come on!

253
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,786
That is Beatriz!

254
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,957
Why didn't you say anything?
It's ridiculous for everyone!

255
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:29,294
- Your pussy was showing!
- Why didn't you tell me?

256
00:19:29,294 --> 00:19:34,507
You do what you want, you are free.
That's it. It will show.

257
00:20:01,659 --> 00:20:06,247
Guys, please welcome Zeeba.

258
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:26,768
I know who she is, man!

259
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,562
This is fucked up, man.

260
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:33,191
- Yeah.
- This is crazy, man.

261
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:38,780
- How's your heart?
- My heart is hers now.

262
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:45,119
- Forget it.
- We think we'll be able to resist.

263
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:50,249
That we just want to have fun.
Then you look at her and say, "Man."

264
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,086
No, man. It's just that...

265
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:59,384
We've been through a lot.
She forgave many things I did.

266
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:04,305
She is the person that...
Man, I doubted it.

267
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,684
- And you shouldn't have.
- Yeah.

268
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:12,480
"Is she a saint or a whore?"
I doubted it, man.

269
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,859
We live with so many people
that make us doubt it.

270
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:21,197
My friends said I was distant.
Because I fucking love her, man.

271
00:21:40,591 --> 00:21:44,971
Welcome to Summer, Floripa!

272
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:08,036
Let me tell you something.

273
00:22:08,036 --> 00:22:11,789
I've made many mistakes. I really did.

274
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:18,671
I want you to be the mother of my kids,
I want you forever.

275
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,007
Fuck it.

276
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,727
I've cried so much, you've no idea.

277
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,607
Me, too.

278
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:48,242
I'm sorry about everything.
I know I was wrong.

279
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:53,623
I didn't act like a man. Forgive me.

280
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:03,174
I swear, I said I was going
to just go wild,

281
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:07,470
and be the stud of the house,
but that's not me anymore.

282
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:09,889
It doesn't matter.

283
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:15,019
We need to be great by being ourselves!

284
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:35,123
I love you in a way
you don't understand yet.

285
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:40,920
I love you.

286
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:48,511
- He clearly likes her, but...
- Yeah.

287
00:23:48,511 --> 00:23:54,475
I'm no therapist, but he likes her
in the wrong way, possessively.

288
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:58,938
"The thing is hanging out."
He didn't want her there.

289
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:04,443
She could be showing everything.
He has to see that she is free.

290
00:24:04,569 --> 00:24:07,280
- I agree.
- She is an outgoing woman.

291
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:13,327
Maybe they have to see
that as a couple they don't match.

292
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:17,999
They like each other, that's a fact.
That's for sure.

293
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:22,587
But I feel that Luan is very possessive.
And Bia is not like that.

294
00:24:22,587 --> 00:24:25,882
- It's still too soon.
- He has to grow.

295
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:29,927
I think he's very insecure towards her.

296
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:34,515
- That's it.
- I don't know how healthy that is.

297
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,893
Yes, he is possessive.

298
00:24:36,893 --> 00:24:41,731
Let me tell you...
Even committed guys treat me right.

299
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:45,359
Everything was wrong.
There was no commitment.

300
00:24:45,359 --> 00:24:49,655
- But I've never seen anything like this.
- Me neither, this was heavy...

301
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:53,409
- I've never seen it.
- He said her pussy was showing?

302
00:24:53,409 --> 00:24:56,746
- That was low, right?
- It was low.

303
00:24:56,913 --> 00:25:02,084
But Pabllo, if some boy said to you,
"Your pussy..."

304
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:07,882
-"Your pussy is escaping."
- I'd laugh and say, "Get a grip."

305
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,967
I would say...

306
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:13,012
- Say it to me, Titto.
- John, I must say...

307
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:17,683
- I'm here. Say it.
- Man, I need a water tank.

308
00:25:17,892 --> 00:25:22,230
- Say it.
- John, your pussy is showing.

309
00:25:23,981 --> 00:25:26,567
Pabllo, help me out. It's dripping.

310
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,696
- Oh, girl.
- John would say, "I don't have a pussy.

311
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:34,575
"Caterpillars become butterflies,
buttholes turn into pussies."

312
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:37,536
- And he said, "You're free."
- He told her off.

313
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:42,375
"You can do what you want."
Then I could show my body.

314
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:43,709
Exactly.

315
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:46,879
His approach was wrong, touching her.

316
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:52,802
I think he did that to show other boys
that she's with him, you know?

317
00:25:52,802 --> 00:25:57,098
- Horrible, very dated.
- Jealousy, possession, ego.

318
00:25:57,306 --> 00:26:00,434
I think he lied.
She wasn't showing anything.

319
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:04,480
He lied to get her out of there,
because he didn't like it.

320
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,940
He wasn't comfortable.

321
00:26:06,232 --> 00:26:08,442
We can't forget the new member, Anna.

322
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:10,611
She introduced those boys to Nath.

323
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:14,532
- I liked Anna.
- Let's play it, I wanna see it.

324
00:26:14,657 --> 00:26:20,204
Wait, I missed something.
With all this partying, I remembered João.

325
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:23,165
I thought we could call him.

326
00:26:23,416 --> 00:26:28,629
- For God's sake, call now!
- I'll call him and we'll understand...

327
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:31,007
what happened.

328
00:26:35,177 --> 00:26:38,055
- Damn, dude!
- Dude! What's up?

329
00:26:38,222 --> 00:26:42,184
- What's up?
- It's an honor to get your call, bro!

330
00:26:42,393 --> 00:26:47,481
- I'll put you on the big screen.
- All right, I'll turn the phone around.

331
00:26:47,815 --> 00:26:49,734
- How are you, man?
- Buddy!

332
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:52,028
- Hey, João!
- My God!

333
00:26:52,236 --> 00:26:55,740
Thank God, I'm great. I miss you guys.

334
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:00,953
Man, we see everyone partying
and think of you.

335
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:03,873
Tell us what happened.
Why are you not there?

336
00:27:03,998 --> 00:27:09,253
Guys, you're not gonna believe this.
I was in Floripa,

337
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:13,257
about to get in the house,
and I got real sick.

338
00:27:13,466 --> 00:27:16,761
I had a headache I never felt before.

339
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:20,348
I fainted, I was in a coma for eight days.

340
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:23,225
Are you serious? Swear to God, man?

341
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:28,064
I swear to God, man.
I've never been this serious in my life.

342
00:27:28,189 --> 00:27:32,151
But are you okay now?
A hundred percent, cured and alive?

343
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:36,614
Yes, thank God.
I met Death, patted him on the back

344
00:27:36,614 --> 00:27:39,075
and said, "Maybe in eighty years."

345
00:27:39,241 --> 00:27:41,452
- What an icon!
- Dude!

346
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:46,207
Looked at Death's face and said,
"I still have many people to fuck!"

347
00:27:46,332 --> 00:27:49,835
Holy shit, tell me about it, bro!
That's crazy.

348
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:53,506
Thank God, everything is okay.
The pain is over.

349
00:27:53,631 --> 00:27:56,509
Now that you're famous,
are you still crying to get laid?

350
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:59,678
Jesus!

351
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:04,058
That only happened once
and it had never happened before.

352
00:28:04,266 --> 00:28:06,727
Those were tears of arousal.

353
00:28:09,105 --> 00:28:10,815
Very good!

354
00:28:11,357 --> 00:28:14,693
I posted that, "Tears of arousal."

355
00:28:14,819 --> 00:28:18,739
João, don't worry.
You don't need to cry with me, okay?

356
00:28:19,573 --> 00:28:22,576
We're just gonna laugh,
we're gonna cum together.

357
00:28:23,661 --> 00:28:26,747
I'm shocked. I have a wig too, you know?

358
00:28:26,747 --> 00:28:31,210
João, did you meet Anna before?
We found her hot. What did you think?

359
00:28:31,460 --> 00:28:34,547
Man, I met Anna.

360
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:38,759
Look at his smile. Naughty!

361
00:28:38,759 --> 00:28:44,515
I'm like this because we kissed
before the show started.

362
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:50,980
I have a reputation, right? Tell me.

363
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:55,901
Johnny, we'll let you go.
Do you want to leave anyone a message?

364
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:58,279
Brother...

365
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:01,365
A special kiss to all Brazilian women.

366
00:29:02,408 --> 00:29:05,244
- Phony!
- Take care, bro!

367
00:29:05,244 --> 00:29:07,538
- God bless you!
- Kisses!

368
00:29:07,663 --> 00:29:09,790
- Take care.
- Bye, guys.

369
00:29:09,790 --> 00:29:11,917
- Bye.
- See you. God bless.

370
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:14,962
- Hot thing!
- Hot thing!

371
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:18,382
I'll miss him and his hot brother.

372
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:21,969
Let's see what happened,
if they fought or not.

373
00:29:21,969 --> 00:29:25,389
I think there's gonna be
some tension on the bus.

374
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:31,812
Off to the after party!

375
00:29:47,411 --> 00:29:49,121
You go!

376
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:07,932
- Hey, welcome! I know.
- With chocolate sauce.

377
00:30:15,981 --> 00:30:17,233
Can I come in?

378
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:21,278
Gotta get my toothbrush.

379
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:27,034
Mine is there, too. I can do it.

380
00:30:30,162 --> 00:30:33,040
There is a jerk for everything, right?

381
00:30:39,046 --> 00:30:42,132
Bia and that guy should sleep
in the sex room, right?

382
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:45,177
They're already having sex
in the bathroom.

383
00:30:47,513 --> 00:30:49,848
The bed. Wanna see it?

384
00:30:50,391 --> 00:30:55,229
- The plastic. Right?
- Yeah, it's hard.

385
00:30:55,813 --> 00:30:57,648
What's that?

386
00:31:10,703 --> 00:31:14,790
We could go to the bedroom.
There's whipped cream and all.

387
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:19,878
- Whipped cream... My clothes are a mess.
- Let's go to the bedroom.

388
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:24,883
- Let's drink some more.
- We can drink tomorrow.

389
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:29,138
- I wanted to have sex here, too.
- Let's do it.

390
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:31,765
Okay, but I...

391
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:38,230
But not only here.

392
00:31:38,355 --> 00:31:40,190
You're going to blow me?

393
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:45,487
I don't want it to only be sex here,
I want to have children with you.

394
00:31:45,487 --> 00:31:47,823
All right, let's talk.

395
00:32:31,825 --> 00:32:33,911
Good morning, Floripa!

396
00:32:48,884 --> 00:32:50,761
Gather up, guys.

397
00:32:51,512 --> 00:32:53,263
Say it.

398
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:55,766
- We have a message.
- Oh, my God.

399
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:59,103
- Message? Wait for Thais.
- It's our manager.

400
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,563
- No way.
- What's up, guys?

401
00:33:01,563 --> 00:33:04,817
- It's Ricardo!
- I want you to see our new bar.

402
00:33:04,942 --> 00:33:07,569
It's on Praia Mole. I'm waiting for you.

403
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,698
- See you.
- Let's go see it!

404
00:33:10,698 --> 00:33:14,410
- We're coming!
- We're not working, just seeing it.

405
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:18,038
We're going to rock today, that's it!

406
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:23,043
We're gonna party
and get to know the bar, partner.

407
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:24,878
I think she'll...

408
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:34,847
Is it on the beach or at a bar?

409
00:33:34,847 --> 00:33:37,474
I think our new gig is at a bar.

410
00:33:41,562 --> 00:33:43,397
Girls, let's go!

411
00:33:43,397 --> 00:33:45,482
Let's go. The van is here!

412
00:33:45,482 --> 00:33:49,486
- Let's go to work.
- Let's go! Beach, sun, Floripa!

413
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:51,280
Move it, come on.

414
00:33:51,447 --> 00:33:53,574
- We're coming.
- Let's go.

415
00:33:57,035 --> 00:34:00,080
- It's Friday.
- It's Friday, let's have fun!

416
00:34:29,651 --> 00:34:34,323
Today is gonna be the day.
Life is hard, but the beach is easy.

417
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:38,452
- My God! Look at this!
- That's crazy!

418
00:34:39,787 --> 00:34:41,914
- What's this bar?
- Hey, Ricardo!

419
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:46,418
Hey, Ricardo!

420
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,504
He's inked!

421
00:34:50,547 --> 00:34:53,801
This is the bar I'm managing.
What do you think?

422
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:57,221
- Wonderful.
- Look at this view.

423
00:34:57,513 --> 00:34:58,889
I'm thirsty!

424
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:02,309
You can drink tomorrow.

425
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:06,563
Girls, have fun.
Boys, let's get you uniforms.

426
00:35:06,563 --> 00:35:09,733
- All right. Thanks, Ramon.
- Have a good day at work.

427
00:35:09,733 --> 00:35:12,861
- Thanks, Mu.
- I don't want to work!

428
00:35:22,538 --> 00:35:28,085
Good afternoon, welcome.
Make yourselves at home.

429
00:35:30,379 --> 00:35:31,713
A beer?

430
00:35:33,882 --> 00:35:35,259
No problem.

431
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:38,470
One for all, and all for one.

432
00:35:38,595 --> 00:35:39,805
I'll chug it.

433
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:43,308
Let me help you, love. Kidding.

434
00:35:43,308 --> 00:35:45,811
- I wish.
- Are you allowed?

435
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:48,647
- I'll try and get glasses.
- Are you allowed?

436
00:35:48,647 --> 00:35:50,941
- I'm not.
- I saw you drinking.

437
00:35:50,941 --> 00:35:53,402
- I wish.
- Are you with her?

438
00:35:53,402 --> 00:35:54,444
Sorry?

439
00:35:55,195 --> 00:35:58,156
That girl over there looking mad
is my girlfriend.

440
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:03,662
You have a girlfriend? Where? Who is she?

441
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:08,417
The one with the rainbow shirt?
She's wonderful!

442
00:36:08,417 --> 00:36:11,420
She's not my girlfriend,
but we're together.

443
00:36:14,590 --> 00:36:16,216
Where's the token?

444
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:20,804
It's yours. I was looking for you.

445
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,557
Luan!

446
00:36:29,479 --> 00:36:31,732
- Listen up, guys.
- Oh, my God.

447
00:36:31,732 --> 00:36:36,528
It's almost another shift.
You can enjoy the party a little.

448
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:41,909
Get the boss a beer,
because I'm on my way!

449
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,999
Now I want a real toast!

450
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:51,209
We're here!

451
00:36:51,335 --> 00:36:53,587
Let's get wasted! Fuck!

452
00:36:53,587 --> 00:36:55,839
- It's over, man.
- Cheers, guys.

453
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:57,174
The shift.

454
00:36:58,592 --> 00:37:00,719
- What?
- Nothing.

455
00:37:01,678 --> 00:37:04,139
- Guys, listen up...
- Habla.

456
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:07,559
- I have cool plans for us.
- Now, in this state?

457
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,102
No, tonight.

458
00:37:09,102 --> 00:37:11,939
I have bad news and good news for you.

459
00:37:11,939 --> 00:37:13,148
The bad one first.

460
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:15,359
You're already drunk.

461
00:37:15,525 --> 00:37:18,278
- The good one?
- It's an open-bar party.

462
00:37:19,905 --> 00:37:21,990
We're going to Slott tonight!

463
00:37:23,325 --> 00:37:25,202
We're gonna do this!

464
00:37:25,369 --> 00:37:28,664
- Is this good or bad news? Yes.
- Open bar?

465
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:31,375
That's it. We're gonna drink a lot.

466
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,920
- Why aren't you coming?
- You didn't kiss me.

467
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:38,048
- You were talking to those hoes.
- My God.

468
00:37:43,512 --> 00:37:46,139
- I'll be right back.
- Are you tipsy, Anna?

469
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:49,643
Mind your own business!

470
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:52,062
- I'll wait.
- Did you see my speedos?

471
00:37:52,688 --> 00:37:54,815
As tacky as your trunks and your hat.

472
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:57,526
Let's see.

473
00:37:57,776 --> 00:37:59,027
Is it a set?

474
00:37:59,027 --> 00:38:02,406
- Wanna see the set?
- No, thank you.

475
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:06,326
I always say he needs to be quiet.

476
00:38:06,326 --> 00:38:11,373
- He's great with his mouth shut!
- And with his hole shut too.

477
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:15,002
- Come on, man!
- Whoa, my God!

478
00:38:15,002 --> 00:38:17,129
- Nath. just kidding.
- Get off!

479
00:38:18,714 --> 00:38:20,007
Look who's back.

480
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:34,730
It's hot, it's hot
I don't just wanna kiss, I also wanna...

481
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,068
- That's you.
- Are you serious?

482
00:38:41,028 --> 00:38:45,907
- You complained and came back.
- Why? Do I have a girlfriend?

483
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:47,409
Where's the music?

484
00:38:49,453 --> 00:38:55,042
- We'll talk later.
- Why later? Let's sit and talk now.

485
00:39:00,047 --> 00:39:02,883
Now you want to be my girlfriend?

486
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:07,679
- Fuck! No.
- Then give me a kiss.

487
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:12,976
Luan, seriously.

488
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:16,104
I just can't.

489
00:39:18,106 --> 00:39:20,192
Don't you get it?

490
00:39:20,692 --> 00:39:23,278
I get it. I see you want to be single.

491
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:26,615
- Did I say that?
- We can't start a relationship overnight.

492
00:39:26,615 --> 00:39:30,911
- Man, it's not that. The point is...
- Until I feel this is different...

493
00:39:30,911 --> 00:39:34,539
- It's about respect.
- Was I disrespectful? Did I kiss anyone?

494
00:39:34,539 --> 00:39:38,710
- Not yet, but I'm afraid you will.
- Not yet. Maybe I will.

495
00:39:38,710 --> 00:39:41,338
Depends on what happens.
If we're not okay,

496
00:39:41,463 --> 00:39:45,509
I may kiss another girl.
So far, it's all good.

497
00:39:45,509 --> 00:39:48,136
If we're not okay,
you'll kiss another girl?

498
00:39:48,136 --> 00:39:53,058
Yes, but I won't hide it.
If we're fighting, we'll talk it over.

499
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:57,813
- I won't just go...
- You won't fuck around like last time,

500
00:39:57,813 --> 00:40:00,107
- and came back to me?
- Cut the drama.

501
00:40:00,315 --> 00:40:02,692
- No, that's what happened.
- All right.

502
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:05,487
- You never told me.
- Let's do this...

503
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:10,200
Have fun.
Isn't that why you're here? Let this go.

504
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,495
I'm not here to play anyone. Forget it.

505
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:16,915
If you are questioning it...
I'm totally cool.

506
00:40:16,915 --> 00:40:20,752
- What do you mean? I'm not questioning.
- I'm totally cool.

507
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:24,131
- The point is I don't want...
- Look, I'll say it again.

508
00:40:24,131 --> 00:40:27,008
I want you to be worthy
of the love I have for you.

509
00:40:27,008 --> 00:40:30,762
- If you're not worthy, fine.
- All right, then.

510
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:34,516
- I won't bother you anymore.
- You were sneaking out...

511
00:40:34,516 --> 00:40:38,186
Look. I won't fucking bother you again.
You're talking too much.

512
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:42,482
- You're saying we're not a couple.
- You're not going to stress me out.

513
00:40:42,482 --> 00:40:43,775
I wanna keep it light.

514
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,652
It's good just when we have sex.

515
00:40:45,652 --> 00:40:47,654
I won't bother you anymore.

516
00:40:47,863 --> 00:40:50,073
"It's good just when we have sex." Okay!

517
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:57,956
- Girl, I don't know what to do.
- What happened?

518
00:40:57,956 --> 00:41:02,836
I tried to be honest
and say that I acted weird today,

519
00:41:02,836 --> 00:41:05,422
because I'm afraid of what might happen.

520
00:41:05,422 --> 00:41:08,592
But he doesn't understand our history.

521
00:41:08,592 --> 00:41:14,472
I told you, if Murilo had done a third
of what he's done, I'd kill him.

522
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:20,145
And never again, girl.
You can find good sex anywhere.

523
00:41:20,145 --> 00:41:24,649
If the sex is not good,
you teach and it's perfect.

524
00:41:24,649 --> 00:41:26,359
- Fuck no.
- Sure!

525
00:41:26,359 --> 00:41:29,446
- Fuck no.
- You can find good sex, Murilo.

526
00:41:29,738 --> 00:41:34,326
- I don't wanna be played again.
- If it weren't good, you'd find another.

527
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:36,203
That's the reality.

528
00:41:36,203 --> 00:41:38,079
- It's great.
- The flesh...

529
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:40,040
is weak, partner.

530
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:44,961
Listen up. The bar is closing.
We drank enough and there's a party.

531
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:47,255
- Let's go home?
- Home!

532
00:41:47,255 --> 00:41:51,343
- I'll have stroganoff.
- Oh, there's stroganoff.

533
00:41:51,343 --> 00:41:52,469
Stroganoff.

534
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:56,514
Let's go. We have more partying to do.

535
00:42:17,494 --> 00:42:18,870
At home, finally.

536
00:42:22,249 --> 00:42:23,875
I'm going too.

537
00:42:27,379 --> 00:42:28,672
It's perfect.

538
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:38,390
You thought Lu would get undressed?

539
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:41,726
- Now?
- No!

540
00:42:42,602 --> 00:42:44,354
In this case...

541
00:42:47,649 --> 00:42:50,527
We'll do this? Take it off, girl.

542
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:54,781
What's he gonna take off?

543
00:42:55,573 --> 00:42:58,910
I can't.

544
00:42:59,661 --> 00:43:02,747
- Do like Luan.
- Fuck, girl.

545
00:43:03,248 --> 00:43:06,251
Take that off, Ramon.
Are you ashamed of your dick?

546
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:19,931
I'm cool.

547
00:43:40,243 --> 00:43:41,953
Crazy girl.

548
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:44,539
- Where's my lighter?
- In the box.

549
00:43:44,539 --> 00:43:46,541
I want it back.

550
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:49,210
I can't lay down on here.

551
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:52,547
- What do you think?
- I bumped into you.

552
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,511
- You're hard to get, right?
- Sometimes.

553
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:02,057
Sometimes. Other times, I'm easy.

554
00:44:03,058 --> 00:44:05,268
I was easy to get with you.

555
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,354
- What?
- I was easy.

556
00:44:07,354 --> 00:44:09,356
- What?
- I hit on you.

557
00:44:09,356 --> 00:44:13,026
- What?
- In Green Valley. You were hard to get.

558
00:44:13,026 --> 00:44:14,444
- Me?
- Sure.

559
00:44:14,444 --> 00:44:16,738
Of course not! I kissed you.

560
00:44:16,738 --> 00:44:20,283
If I'd known I'd meet you that day,
I wouldn't have come.

561
00:44:20,533 --> 00:44:22,994
But I was in bad shape then.

562
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:27,165
But I understand, you know?
After everything passed, I got it.

563
00:44:27,165 --> 00:44:31,961
- First, I hated your guts.
- And badmouthed me all over Brasília.

564
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:34,672
- Brasília? No way.
- Sorry, Goiânia. Right!

565
00:44:57,904 --> 00:45:01,324
Come on, guys, the bus is here!

566
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:03,326
Let's go!

567
00:45:03,326 --> 00:45:04,869
Come on!

568
00:45:04,869 --> 00:45:06,287
A player plays.

569
00:45:12,794 --> 00:45:14,546
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

570
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:16,256
Let's go!

571
00:45:16,256 --> 00:45:17,924
Good evening, guys.

572
00:45:33,148 --> 00:45:35,692
Come on, guys!

573
00:45:40,864 --> 00:45:42,490
Leave the glass, Bê.

574
00:46:02,469 --> 00:46:05,180
How are you? Been here a while?

575
00:46:05,722 --> 00:46:08,808
I'll just hook up with you.
Of course I want to.

576
00:46:22,447 --> 00:46:25,200
Do you want babies? Want a family?

577
00:46:26,659 --> 00:46:29,370
Oh, you're still a baby. How old are you?

578
00:46:29,787 --> 00:46:32,957
How old are you? Thirty-eight?

579
00:46:32,957 --> 00:46:34,542
Fuck!

580
00:46:43,176 --> 00:46:46,513
Are you gonna play tonight?

581
00:47:04,697 --> 00:47:07,075
- All three DJs are brothers.
- Damn.

582
00:47:07,075 --> 00:47:09,244
- Anna liked one.
- I want the other.

583
00:47:09,244 --> 00:47:12,956
The one with the long hair?
Leave him for me. Keep the other.

584
00:47:12,956 --> 00:47:16,459
- No, we both kiss him.
- We'll exchange then.

585
00:47:16,459 --> 00:47:18,419
- Deal!
- Yeah!

586
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:27,387
- You're asking too much.
- When I ask, you say nothing.

587
00:47:28,471 --> 00:47:29,389
You say nothing.

588
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:33,685
Actually, she's with him. She said,
"I'm gonna kiss you" and turned around.

589
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:35,603
Wasn't it?

590
00:47:42,569 --> 00:47:46,197
- She's with him. Today was insane.
- And are you with me?

591
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:47,699
- Sorry?
- Are you with me?

592
00:47:47,824 --> 00:47:48,783
With you?

593
00:47:48,783 --> 00:47:50,034
Am I?

594
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:51,369
Maybe.

595
00:47:52,036 --> 00:47:53,454
Come dance.

596
00:47:58,126 --> 00:47:59,502
I kissed.

597
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:13,266
I'm very drunk.

598
00:48:13,266 --> 00:48:15,143
- What about Bia?
- I'm not in this.

599
00:48:15,143 --> 00:48:19,814
I saw you guys talking,
getting closer to each other...

600
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:23,610
- What's going on with you two?
- Mu, I talked to her, bro.

601
00:48:23,860 --> 00:48:29,240
I said, "Do you wanna be with me?"
It seems something is stopping her.

602
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:31,492
- I'd love to be with her.
- Sure.

603
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:36,414
So far, I'm always the one
approaching her, kissing her,

604
00:48:36,414 --> 00:48:40,877
talking to her, seducing her.

605
00:48:40,877 --> 00:48:43,671
She hasn't come to talk to me once yet.

606
00:48:44,088 --> 00:48:47,925
She thinks it's all about her?
What the fuck, bro?

607
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:53,014
She's with me, I'm the man, bro.
I am a whole new level.

608
00:48:53,389 --> 00:48:56,517
- Fuck. I go after her all the time.
- It's true.

609
00:48:56,517 --> 00:48:59,270
I see it, that's what I'm saying.

610
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:03,399
The only way for Beatriz and me is
to pretend we are strangers.

611
00:49:16,913 --> 00:49:22,293
Murilão! The party is ending,
and there's an after party at the house.

612
00:49:22,919 --> 00:49:24,462
You're invited!

613
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:26,005
Who's coming?

614
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:29,884
Hey, DJ, let's go!

615
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:31,469
You, too?

616
00:50:24,981 --> 00:50:27,233
Is everything okay?

617
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:29,110
Can't get better.

618
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:34,699
- Yeah, Mariana...
- I've just waited.

619
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:37,577
- I just waited.
- I told you.

620
00:50:37,577 --> 00:50:40,163
- It happened.
- People brought me here.

621
00:50:40,163 --> 00:50:42,457
Some people do worse, you know?

622
00:50:42,457 --> 00:50:45,626
Murilo, you didn't wait!

623
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:48,588
- You didn't wait.
- I'm not talking to you.

624
00:50:48,588 --> 00:50:52,258
I'm not talking to you, okay?

625
00:50:52,258 --> 00:50:55,762
Be cool, and stay out of my life.

626
00:50:56,220 --> 00:50:57,680
Okay?

627
00:50:57,680 --> 00:51:01,893
I'm cool. I'm not talking to you.

628
00:51:02,185 --> 00:51:04,854
Hold your horses, girl.

629
00:51:04,854 --> 00:51:08,524
- Girl, it takes one idiot.
- Everybody here is free.

630
00:51:08,733 --> 00:51:12,361
Everybody is free.
When you know the whole story,

631
00:51:12,361 --> 00:51:17,742
when you hear both sides,
you can give your opinion.

632
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:20,453
- I'm cool.
- No, no.

633
00:51:20,953 --> 00:51:23,664
Leave him, he's talking to himself.

634
00:51:23,664 --> 00:51:25,374
I'm talking to myself.

635
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:28,836
And you're the only one freaking out.

636
00:51:30,004 --> 00:51:31,798
What a jerk, girl.

637
00:51:31,798 --> 00:51:37,845
He thinks he waited for Tay.
She is hooking up since she arrived.

638
00:51:38,054 --> 00:51:40,389
Wait for what?

639
00:51:40,389 --> 00:51:43,518
He waited for shit, girl.

640
00:51:43,518 --> 00:51:47,355
- He's playing the fool.
- Come on.

641
00:51:50,483 --> 00:51:52,819
No, listen.

642
00:51:52,819 --> 00:51:55,613
- I know...
- I just thought...

643
00:51:55,738 --> 00:52:00,785
Guys, you should feel sorry.
You either shout or are rude.

644
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:20,847
- Come, Ramonzinho.
- I'm home.

645
00:52:20,847 --> 00:52:25,017
Look at this gin
I'm gonna drink at home...

646
00:52:25,393 --> 00:52:27,270
Make yourselves at home.

647
00:52:28,271 --> 00:52:29,897
With the rock.

648
00:52:50,251 --> 00:52:54,380
Man, Murilo didn't have to treat me bad,
especially in front of everybody.

649
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:56,465
- What did he do?
- He did it again.

650
00:52:56,465 --> 00:52:59,468
- What did he do?
- Everything will be fine.

651
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:07,393
- He may be horny for her now...
- What did he say?

652
00:53:08,936 --> 00:53:13,399
Now or in the bus?
"Mind your business, you don't know me."

653
00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:16,027
I had a huge fight with Murilo on the bus.

654
00:53:17,486 --> 00:53:19,113
Did you know?

655
00:53:19,322 --> 00:53:21,490
Man, what do you want?

656
00:53:21,616 --> 00:53:24,035
I'm not going to ignore this, brother!

657
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:27,413
- I'm not going to ignore this!
- Stop!

658
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:28,789
Stop!

659
00:53:28,789 --> 00:53:31,208
Murilo is doing this to the wrong person.

660
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:39,175
It's the accent.

661
00:53:40,593 --> 00:53:43,971
A shower fixes everything. Food does, too.

662
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:56,233
- Sausage and tomato?
- No, it's spicy.

663
00:53:57,860 --> 00:53:59,904
Hey, who's carioca?

664
00:54:00,404 --> 00:54:04,825
- Why did you do that?
- Are you hungry? Here.

665
00:54:14,919 --> 00:54:18,005
I can't. I can't do this.

666
00:54:19,674 --> 00:54:21,926
We're in the best place, I think.

667
00:54:22,468 --> 00:54:23,761
Cool.

668
00:54:28,557 --> 00:54:32,436
- Laying down here is the best!
- Oh, yes!

669
00:55:24,739 --> 00:55:27,700
How about a hot shower?

670
00:55:30,369 --> 00:55:31,370
Goodbye.

671
00:55:58,898 --> 00:56:03,277
Do I look like I'll sleep with someone?
I didn't give you the...

672
00:56:04,862 --> 00:56:06,363
Where's my couple?

673
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:08,407
- I think it's over.
- I don't think so.

674
00:56:08,574 --> 00:56:12,119
- Murilo is taking revenge.
- This could be the end,

675
00:56:12,119 --> 00:56:16,040
- or they could fall in love again.
- Triggering their first fight.

676
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:19,627
- It'll trigger their first fight.
- It'll be their first fight.

677
00:56:19,919 --> 00:56:24,840
- Or their first great moment.
- If he saw her with another guy,

678
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,302
and said,
"Fuck, now I need to find a girl",

679
00:56:28,636 --> 00:56:31,305
- because she'll take the guy home.
- But why?

680
00:56:31,472 --> 00:56:32,848
I felt that too.

681
00:56:32,848 --> 00:56:38,896
This Tay and Murilo thing is wrong.
They're dragging people in.

682
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:42,233
- The girl's single and having fun...
- The girl with Murilo.

683
00:56:42,399 --> 00:56:44,693
- She just met a guy.
- It's not her fault.

684
00:56:44,693 --> 00:56:50,699
- There's no right or wrong here.
- It's Murilo and Tay's problem.

685
00:56:50,950 --> 00:56:55,496
- The girl is just having fun.
- I'd be filing my nails.

686
00:56:55,871 --> 00:57:00,000
Anna hooks her friend up with boys,
she takes her side.

687
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:05,089
- The fact she said...
- Anna's not drunk. That's the difference.

688
00:57:05,214 --> 00:57:10,344
She said, "Who are you waiting for, man?
Are you gonna pretend you were waiting?"

689
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:15,391
But here's the thing about Anna.
Since she arrived this summer,

690
00:57:15,724 --> 00:57:21,147
- she observes, she knows everything.
- Very open-minded.

691
00:57:21,147 --> 00:57:23,190
She's analyzing everything.

692
00:57:23,691 --> 00:57:24,984
IN THE NEXT EPISODE

693
00:57:24,984 --> 00:57:29,864
I don't need to find them having sex
in my bedroom. Now everybody is free.

694
00:57:30,781 --> 00:57:32,074
Fuck!

695
00:57:37,329 --> 00:57:38,664
Our time is over.

696
00:57:39,415 --> 00:57:41,333
Our time is over, okay?

697
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:45,504
For God's sake.
To have to tolerate this...

698
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:47,381
Ah, fuck it!

699
00:57:48,132 --> 00:57:49,550
Damn!

700
00:57:49,550 --> 00:57:52,303
- I'm shocked!
- He cried.

701
00:57:52,469 --> 00:57:56,473
He cried and went to Anna for comfort,
with whom he had fought!

702
00:57:56,682 --> 00:57:58,309
- Was that Anna?
- Yes.

703
00:57:58,309 --> 00:57:59,643
- Was it?
- Yes.

704
00:57:59,643 --> 00:58:05,566
He's crying because he saw Tay
with another guy.

705
00:58:05,691 --> 00:58:08,986
But it's a different day, honey!

706
00:58:09,153 --> 00:58:13,657
Booze only brings the feelings
you have for others to the surface.

707
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:18,871
- Our contemporary poet!
- Had a drink today, Jerry?

708
00:58:19,038 --> 00:58:21,832
- Let's hit the group chat.
- Let's.

709
00:58:21,832 --> 00:58:24,960
- Remember to text me.
- Carol, get the cab.

710
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,212
Six feet, right?

711
00:58:26,212 --> 00:58:28,589
Come on, girl.

712
00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:32,426
Bitch, he's gonna be shocked.
She'll kiss everyone.

713
00:58:32,593 --> 00:58:34,595
Girl, she doesn't lie.

714
00:58:34,595 --> 00:58:36,430
She's everything.

715
00:58:36,430 --> 00:58:40,309
- I hope...
- You understand...
