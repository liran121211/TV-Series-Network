1
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:11,595
God, it's been one week.

2
00:00:11,595 --> 00:00:13,973
- Hello, guys!
- We're back.

3
00:00:13,973 --> 00:00:16,183
Doesn't she look like a cupcake?

4
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,018
This is the best "hello"!

5
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,396
The best "hello, guys".

6
00:00:20,396 --> 00:00:22,398
Pabllo has a pineapple hairdo!

7
00:00:22,398 --> 00:00:23,482
Oh, baby!

8
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:24,900
Sis, what's going...

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,111
Which beach were you at?

10
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:28,654
I'm not at her level.

11
00:00:28,654 --> 00:00:30,448
Girl, you came from there?

12
00:00:30,448 --> 00:00:31,866
From Ibiza!

13
00:00:31,866 --> 00:00:33,117
I loved it!

14
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:35,494
I came like this to fit the mood.

15
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,121
How are you, guys?

16
00:00:37,121 --> 00:00:38,205
Anxious!

17
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,957
Fine, thank God!

18
00:00:39,957 --> 00:00:43,794
I'm shocked,
and there's been only three episodes.

19
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:45,838
You know what's worse?

20
00:00:45,838 --> 00:00:47,131
The disagreement bus.

21
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:49,759
In the beginning
I wanted to ride that bus,

22
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:52,094
now I'm afraid of getting on and arguing.

23
00:00:52,094 --> 00:00:53,971
Because even Tay,

24
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:57,725
the most even-tempered,
got so mad at Murilo

25
00:00:57,725 --> 00:01:00,519
that she got mad at everybody in the bus!

26
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:03,063
- I'm really shocked!
- So am I.

27
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,191
I wouldn't take that bus!

28
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:06,859
If someone pulls my wig off...

29
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:07,902
Girl...

30
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:09,653
There's a curse...

31
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:11,238
And it must be broken.

32
00:01:11,238 --> 00:01:13,407
Everybody is happy at the party,

33
00:01:13,407 --> 00:01:16,368
then they get in the bus,
and it's mayhem.

34
00:01:16,577 --> 00:01:17,953
I'm shocked with Tay

35
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:21,290
because she was even-tempered
and classy,

36
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:25,503
and she got everything off her chest
about Murilo, on that bus.

37
00:01:25,628 --> 00:01:28,422
Also that kick that she missed,
but it did happen.

38
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:30,007
She missed that kick.

39
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:34,220
We saw scenes from next episode,
she broke a glass at the table.

40
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,264
All her class was gone.

41
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,974
It's over!

42
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:42,186
- I don't know what happened!
- Me neither.

43
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:44,855
I think she loves in a different way.

44
00:01:45,397 --> 00:01:47,358
I think she loves in a different way.

45
00:01:47,358 --> 00:01:49,985
No, I think it's Murilo. She's just hurt.

46
00:01:49,985 --> 00:01:52,446
In my opinion, she's just hurt.

47
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:55,533
And when we think we've seen it all,

48
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:57,785
we have Luan, who left the house.

49
00:01:57,785 --> 00:02:01,247
I wonder if Bia will finally
enjoy her vacation.

50
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:03,207
I think she will!

51
00:02:03,207 --> 00:02:04,667
Hit play, dude!

52
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:06,460
I have the remote today!

53
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,963
So hit play, honey!

54
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:10,214
- Can I?
- Sure!

55
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:11,674
Thank you, guys...

56
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,343
God, are you guys excited?

57
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:47,793
WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS 2

58
00:03:06,812 --> 00:03:08,355
What will happen?

59
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,107
I have no idea.

60
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:11,358
We should go out.

61
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:14,111
Nobody will be able to sleep.

62
00:03:14,278 --> 00:03:15,237
Let's go out.

63
00:03:15,237 --> 00:03:17,615
Let's not stay home. It's bothering me.

64
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,246
Yes, we can't be sad.

65
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:27,082
I'd rather go out to blow off steam...

66
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,876
Just the fact of going out...

67
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:35,257
Guys, I also made a decision,
you know?

68
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:36,800
I asked to leave...

69
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,977
I'm kidding.

70
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:49,813
Jeez, motherfucker.

71
00:03:49,813 --> 00:03:51,398
The beer is here.

72
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,733
Motherfucker.

73
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,360
Fuck!

74
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,612
Jeez, that's not funny.

75
00:03:56,946 --> 00:04:00,532
If I had come downstairs
for nothing, I'd be pissed.

76
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:04,286
Tonight, we're gonna party, man.
Cheer up, life goes on.

77
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:09,500
Don't cry, Nathália. I know you love me.

78
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:11,085
She's crying.

79
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:13,212
Come here and hug her.

80
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:15,756
And apologize for that bad joke.

81
00:04:15,756 --> 00:04:17,549
I could... What?

82
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:19,551
Come here, Mu.

83
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:22,262
I'm cooking, making my beef.

84
00:04:24,807 --> 00:04:25,849
Let's go out.

85
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:27,226
And the afterparty!

86
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:29,603
We're already fucked up, let's party.

87
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:42,658
Come!

88
00:04:44,201 --> 00:04:46,120
It's here!

89
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,498
Let's go!

90
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:53,460
Hey, dude...

91
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,503
We got it.

92
00:05:41,633 --> 00:05:43,135
It's good here, girls.

93
00:05:45,429 --> 00:05:47,264
One for all and all for one!

94
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,021
TODAY ONLY ENDS TOMORROW!

95
00:06:00,235 --> 00:06:03,781
One for all and all for one!

96
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:07,076
Guys, I want to make this toast
and tell you

97
00:06:07,076 --> 00:06:08,077
I love you!

98
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,204
Thanks a lot for everything.

99
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:11,622
We're friends!

100
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:16,752
Look at me.

101
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,279
Are you enjoying?

102
00:06:44,738 --> 00:06:46,907
I just got here...

103
00:06:47,616 --> 00:06:48,951
All the guys are here.

104
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:50,619
I'm available.

105
00:07:05,509 --> 00:07:06,885
Weird talk.

106
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:37,958
You smell good.

107
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,793
Oh, son of a bitch.

108
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,422
Where's the thing, brother?

109
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:44,923
That's bad.

110
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:47,593
Was there a problem?

111
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:50,220
- I love you.
- So do I.

112
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,638
Thanks, really.

113
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:55,267
Unfortunately, I think this is
a very good opportunity

114
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:57,769
to show the real Bia.

115
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,563
It's not about kissing others,

116
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:01,356
it's doing what you want!

117
00:08:01,356 --> 00:08:03,942
You wouldn't dance if you wanted,

118
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:06,195
if I were near you.

119
00:08:07,154 --> 00:08:08,780
No.

120
00:08:09,198 --> 00:08:10,490
I'm happy for this.

121
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,242
I like you a lot!

122
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,494
Me too, a lot.

123
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,495
Enjoy!

124
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:17,789
Thanks for everything!

125
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:19,249
- Really!
- Have fun!

126
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:21,210
Thank you!

127
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:23,003
Enjoy this.

128
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,421
Let's have fun.

129
00:08:31,470 --> 00:08:34,264
Smart. I think you should
hook up with that one.

130
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,766
What I'll say?

131
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:37,726
Anna saw the three kissing.

132
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:44,983
Tell me.

133
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,110
Go on, tell me.

134
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,656
If Murilo wasn't in my life,
you'd be the one,

135
00:08:50,656 --> 00:08:53,575
but Bia is free, she wants it very bad.

136
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,452
But forget it.

137
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:59,164
She said, "I'm away from Renan
because I'm gonna grab him."

138
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:01,166
I said, "Wait, I'll fix this."

139
00:09:06,964 --> 00:09:08,298
Let me ask you...

140
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:10,384
You want Renan?

141
00:09:11,426 --> 00:09:13,845
That's what I said, Mu,

142
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,555
he's a nice guy.

143
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,016
Go!

144
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:21,061
There's Luan. Otherwise, I would.

145
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:24,314
Hey, there's no more Luan.

146
00:09:25,148 --> 00:09:26,733
Fuck it,

147
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,944
the black dude is hot.

148
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:30,487
Kiss him.

149
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,044
Guys, they're gonna kiss.

150
00:09:53,885 --> 00:09:55,012
I love it.

151
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:08,734
I told you so.

152
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,905
Love you.

153
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:15,240
I love you.

154
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,367
Baby, I'm here.

155
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:20,329
Now, I am...

156
00:10:20,495 --> 00:10:21,913
That's what you needed.

157
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:23,957
Now I'm...

158
00:10:25,876 --> 00:10:27,544
Let's go over there.

159
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:34,301
- You liked hooking up with Renan?
- Yes.

160
00:10:34,468 --> 00:10:36,219
- Really?
- I liked it.

161
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,138
Was the kiss good?

162
00:10:40,974 --> 00:10:42,100
Did I fuck up?

163
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,686
Of course not.

164
00:10:45,187 --> 00:10:46,813
You're free.

165
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,691
I don't know
if I'm gonna fuck him, you know?

166
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,234
Fucking is something...

167
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:52,277
Fine...

168
00:10:52,277 --> 00:10:54,363
- Take your time...
- Yes...

169
00:10:54,363 --> 00:10:55,822
If you feel like it...

170
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:57,741
I learned one thing here,

171
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:59,493
just do it.

172
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,119
He's also hot, look.

173
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:03,747
- Who?
- You like older guys.

174
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:04,664
No!

175
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,711
The short or the tall one?

176
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:10,629
The tall one!

177
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:14,132
Then we're learning to deal with this now.

178
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:16,885
We're learning...

179
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:19,763
He's very hot.

180
00:11:19,763 --> 00:11:21,264
I don't like older guys.

181
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,392
I'm almost a cradle robber.

182
00:11:24,518 --> 00:11:26,144
Nice to meet you.

183
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:28,021
Beatriz.

184
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:29,481
How are you?

185
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:31,358
I'm fine, what about you?

186
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:34,945
- Did you get here now?
- No, it's been one hour.

187
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:39,449
You only live once, baby.

188
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:59,344
Let's go to the afterparty!

189
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:01,888
Let's go to the afterparty!

190
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:06,101
Let's go!

191
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:08,728
Let's leave.

192
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:27,164
There's inspiration here, right?

193
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:30,584
Yes.

194
00:12:30,584 --> 00:12:32,711
You're a miss? "Miss Chievous."

195
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:37,090
There you go. Now she's against me too.

196
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,262
What goes around comes around.

197
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:47,726
Sorry if you wanted to be VIP.
It didn't happen.

198
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,896
Honey, let me tell you.

199
00:12:51,354 --> 00:12:53,482
Be careful, you're a guest.

200
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,817
I can kick you out whenever I want.

201
00:12:55,984 --> 00:12:57,402
You kick out shit.

202
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:59,821
- You kick her out, my ass.
- And you too.

203
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:02,073
You kick me out shit.

204
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:03,909
You don't kick anybody out.

205
00:13:03,909 --> 00:13:04,826
Kidding.

206
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:07,662
She's my guest,
she leaves whenever I want.

207
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:10,499
Leave me alone.

208
00:13:10,499 --> 00:13:11,500
That's your boss.

209
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,252
I'll take care of my boy.

210
00:13:14,252 --> 00:13:15,712
There you go.

211
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:18,340
Get real.

212
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,842
That girl wants to argue with me.

213
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:23,303
You're tripping, Nath.

214
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:27,015
Get real! She wants to argue with me.

215
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,683
Honey, I'll kick yours.

216
00:13:28,683 --> 00:13:30,477
You don't kick anybody's ass.

217
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:32,395
- Want to see it?
- Yes.

218
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:35,982
Want to see it?

219
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:36,983
Keep your cool.

220
00:13:36,983 --> 00:13:39,986
Get your shit together.

221
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:40,904
I'll tell you.

222
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:43,615
You're tripping, bro.

223
00:13:43,615 --> 00:13:44,866
Let me tell you.

224
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:47,244
You're tripping, Nath.

225
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:51,289
Tripping, my ass.

226
00:13:51,289 --> 00:13:53,041
- Tripping, my ass.
- Tripping!

227
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:56,294
That chick wants to argue with me?

228
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:57,629
Not me, honey.

229
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,381
Not me, honey.

230
00:13:59,381 --> 00:14:01,007
Want to argue with me?

231
00:14:01,132 --> 00:14:03,510
You're in too much of a rush.

232
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:09,099
Relax, dude, for God's sake.

233
00:14:09,099 --> 00:14:10,433
No. Man, relax.

234
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:12,561
I'm sorry.

235
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,372
Welcome back.

236
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:37,752
Do you miss here?

237
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:39,629
Kinda.

238
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:49,598
Just don't bump into me.

239
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:50,932
Don't bump into me.

240
00:15:00,066 --> 00:15:01,860
I can't be mad at you, Tay.

241
00:15:01,985 --> 00:15:04,112
How I wish I could, really.

242
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,157
Good. Being mad is a bad thing.

243
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:09,951
Honestly.

244
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,330
Thanks a lot for hitting me.

245
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:15,373
It's been a long time I've been hit.

246
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:18,668
Renan didn't allow me to hit you.

247
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,962
But I wanted to grab your bangs,

248
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:23,298
you know those bangs of yours?

249
00:15:23,298 --> 00:15:24,549
My dream...

250
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:28,219
was grabbing those bangs
and rubbing your face on the ground.

251
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,026
Good one, dude.

252
00:15:43,026 --> 00:15:46,321
Good to know you're here. Great to know.

253
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,658
Good you're gonna enjoy
the waterfall with us.

254
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:52,160
Fuck, let's rock.

255
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:56,331
Yeah, we're in the house kicking ass...

256
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,502
but I think you're gonna enjoy it too.

257
00:16:00,502 --> 00:16:02,962
I'm waiting for you. Just fucking come.

258
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,798
Let's go!

259
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,257
Let's go.

260
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:10,095
That's funny, right?

261
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:11,262
Everyone...

262
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,806
There's no bed for me?

263
00:16:12,806 --> 00:16:15,725
...would sleep on a bed, right?

264
00:16:26,277 --> 00:16:28,530
Ouch!

265
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,657
Oh, that's great.

266
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,367
That's triggering.

267
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,577
I love that position.

268
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:37,205
It's makeup sex, right?

269
00:16:37,789 --> 00:16:38,915
Now...

270
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:42,836
Finally, we agree. Nath made a mistake.

271
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:43,753
She fucked up.

272
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,255
What she did was nonsense.

273
00:16:45,255 --> 00:16:47,674
She had to work things out with Ramon.

274
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:51,761
I was thinking, "Jeez, they're great."

275
00:16:51,761 --> 00:16:53,263
Yeah, and Ramon too...

276
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:55,932
Ramon made a mistake too...

277
00:16:55,932 --> 00:16:58,977
I don't want to cover up
for anybody, okay?

278
00:16:58,977 --> 00:17:00,437
I won't do this!

279
00:17:00,437 --> 00:17:03,231
But she still has feelings for Ramon.

280
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:04,649
Sure!

281
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:06,609
- It's there, repressed.
- Guys...

282
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:09,028
If I hooked up with somebody...

283
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:12,073
Guys, we don't have a relationship.

284
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:14,951
We've hooked up,
but I see you with another girl.

285
00:17:14,951 --> 00:17:17,787
Sis, be happy,
I'll hook up with others too.

286
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:21,666
Yes, but if you feel something...
It's not like that.

287
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:24,794
Hey, Lexa, do you think...

288
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:28,423
Nath still has feelings for Ramon?

289
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:31,134
I think there's something in there...

290
00:17:31,134 --> 00:17:33,720
There's something deep down there.

291
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:36,639
There's some feelings there.

292
00:17:36,639 --> 00:17:39,601
Nothing like Murilo and Tay.

293
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:41,728
I think it's a mild feeling.

294
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:42,687
It's different.

295
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:46,608
Hey, Jerry. Do you think Ramon
feels the same about Nath?

296
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:48,610
Oh, he has a crush on her.

297
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:51,070
But I think he's way cooler than her.

298
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:53,156
That attitude of his...

299
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:59,037
made her feel that way about him.

300
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:00,079
Because...

301
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:02,791
Yeah, all that confidence... Damn, man.

302
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:04,709
He's hooking up with girls,

303
00:18:04,709 --> 00:18:06,795
I think... He forgot her...

304
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:08,338
Go live your life!

305
00:18:08,338 --> 00:18:11,508
He doesn't express his feelings, you know?

306
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:15,094
That's fucked up
because he doesn't express them.

307
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:18,181
We need to praise the new couple.

308
00:18:18,515 --> 00:18:20,725
Anna and Tay. For God's sake.

309
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:24,103
They're not a couple
because she ended up with Murilo.

310
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,314
Girl, from the bottom of my heart,

311
00:18:26,314 --> 00:18:29,400
I still think
that is friendship realness...

312
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,152
I want to make this fanfic.

313
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:32,278
What, Pabllo?

314
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,364
Friendship, realness.

315
00:18:34,531 --> 00:18:36,699
- What?
- But I ship...

316
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:39,244
After two hours, Carol said, "What?"

317
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:42,121
Pabllo's great. Great!

318
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,456
What did you say?

319
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:47,210
They're friends with benefits,
like... Let's kiss.

320
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,879
I don't speak other languages. Sorry.

321
00:18:52,173 --> 00:18:56,886
Let's talk about Bia.
For God's sake, she surprised me.

322
00:18:57,053 --> 00:18:58,471
She kissed a lot!

323
00:18:58,638 --> 00:19:01,224
- I was expecting that reaction from her.
- Me, too.

324
00:19:01,224 --> 00:19:04,018
It was nice
that she hit on that second guy.

325
00:19:04,018 --> 00:19:06,396
I thought that was wonderful.

326
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,481
Girl, she's totally like me.

327
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:11,276
Lexa is drinking wine on a chilly night.

328
00:19:11,276 --> 00:19:12,861
Guys, I am.

329
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:16,155
In Campos, do... "I guess, honey."

330
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:19,200
What? Guys, I'm here
with wonderful people, watching...

331
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:21,953
watching that debauchery. I'm great.

332
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,587
Thanks for yesterday.

333
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:32,755
- It was great.
- Thank you.

334
00:19:32,755 --> 00:19:35,258
I loved it too. Sorry.

335
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:37,969
You don't have to apologize.

336
00:19:37,969 --> 00:19:39,345
Accept my apologies.

337
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:42,932
I loved it.

338
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,310
- Thanks for the night.
- Thank you.

339
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:46,769
Kisses...

340
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:49,731
Of course we'll meet again.

341
00:19:51,274 --> 00:19:53,985
- That means you're leaving, right?
- Humiliating.

342
00:19:59,991 --> 00:20:01,701
Okay, boy.

343
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:02,744
Two friends.

344
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:06,372
I'm very happy after last night,
my vibe was killed...

345
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:09,042
The guys are helping out here, bro.

346
00:20:09,042 --> 00:20:10,335
Don't do this.

347
00:20:10,335 --> 00:20:12,003
Motherfucker!

348
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:14,422
The prick was teasing.

349
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:17,091
This motherfucker said, "I am team Nath."

350
00:20:18,134 --> 00:20:19,260
And I, "Fuck."

351
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22,263
I'm team Nath!

352
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:24,891
No, you were cool.

353
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:27,310
You and Bia hold it together.

354
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:29,771
As far as possible,

355
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:32,690
you respected me.

356
00:20:32,690 --> 00:20:34,776
You don't even exist to me, jerk.

357
00:20:34,776 --> 00:20:35,944
Drink it!

358
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:37,737
Say it to my face.

359
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:39,530
I'm not talking about you.

360
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,324
Say it, repeat what I said.

361
00:20:41,324 --> 00:20:42,825
You're full of shit.

362
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:45,954
- I'll say whatever I want.
- Keep talking shit.

363
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:46,996
Okay.

364
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:49,582
If you don't want to hear it,
block your ears.

365
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:50,875
Jerk!

366
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,794
You need to stop.

367
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:55,338
You two are the least...

368
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:58,466
You don't have a reason to fight.

369
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:01,928
Exactly, to me, he doesn't even exist.

370
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:04,973
If it were Murilo
hooking up with some girl, okay.

371
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:06,849
Hey, don't say my name.

372
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:08,893
The problem was his chick, so...

373
00:21:08,893 --> 00:21:10,436
What did she do?

374
00:21:10,436 --> 00:21:12,313
She was born.

375
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:15,942
- She breathed.
- Sorry.

376
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:18,403
He's a jerk.

377
00:21:29,455 --> 00:21:33,126
He bleached his hair.

378
00:21:33,126 --> 00:21:35,461
Do the L, Lacerda.

379
00:21:38,131 --> 00:21:39,132
Come!

380
00:21:39,132 --> 00:21:41,175
He bleached his hair, you know?

381
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:42,969
He bleached his hair!

382
00:21:47,015 --> 00:21:49,642
Fuck, you're rad. I should hit on you.

383
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:54,897
Fuck, I wanted to come at level hard!

384
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,900
Blond boy!

385
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,194
Motherfucker.

386
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:01,571
It was a joke, right?

387
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:04,907
Sure. Whose idea?

388
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:08,077
Let me introduce. Bia, Renato.

389
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:10,079
- Renato, Bia.
- Nice to meet you.

390
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:13,082
Fuck, this is a thug thing.

391
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:16,502
Tay. Tay, Renato. Renato, Tay.

392
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,005
Wear sneakers to go for a hike.

393
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:20,840
I know it. Mu!

394
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:23,217
Mu, that's my good friend, from Rio.

395
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:24,886
- Renato.
- I think I...

396
00:22:25,470 --> 00:22:28,556
This is that boy from the square, man.

397
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:31,142
I've met him, man.

398
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:33,186
Yeah, with Mateus.

399
00:22:33,186 --> 00:22:34,771
Is Mateus your friend?

400
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:37,774
You son of a bitch.
I can't believe this, bro.

401
00:22:39,484 --> 00:22:41,027
Where's...

402
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:44,947
Let me introduce.

403
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,407
- Renato.
- Nice to meet you.

404
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:49,744
Guys, is it Milena's boy?

405
00:22:49,744 --> 00:22:51,954
Hey, man. Jeez, dude.

406
00:22:51,954 --> 00:22:53,539
I know her.

407
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:55,583
How are you? I'm fine.

408
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:57,585
Fine.

409
00:22:58,461 --> 00:23:00,546
- Which one?
- Bro...

410
00:23:00,713 --> 00:23:02,840
I guess you haven't met.

411
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:04,300
Grow up, dude.

412
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:06,511
- I'll tell you later.
- Fuck!

413
00:23:07,553 --> 00:23:08,971
Rio is a small city.

414
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,056
Fucking small.

415
00:23:12,517 --> 00:23:14,185
Let's go to the waterfall?

416
00:23:14,185 --> 00:23:17,021
Let's go!

417
00:23:17,355 --> 00:23:19,273
All I wanted was to go for a hike.

418
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:31,119
It's beautiful, bro.

419
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,704
It's beautiful, man.

420
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:35,331
This is the waterfall.

421
00:23:35,331 --> 00:23:37,834
I wanted to introduce you
to the waterfall.

422
00:23:37,834 --> 00:23:39,418
Waterfall, Renan.

423
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:41,212
Renan's never seen a waterfall.

424
00:23:41,212 --> 00:23:43,381
- Who put that water there?
- God.

425
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:56,519
I've met him,
he hooks up with my best friend...

426
00:23:56,519 --> 00:23:58,062
Are you a grass cutter?

427
00:23:58,062 --> 00:23:59,355
No, but...

428
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:01,023
We're at Vitrinni...

429
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:04,360
The same way she hooks up
with guys whom I hook up with too.

430
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,612
It's not a problem for us, you know?

431
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:09,866
You kissed Ramon...
Ramon can't kiss anybody else.

432
00:24:09,866 --> 00:24:11,242
Because of you.

433
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,618
Did you get it?

434
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,745
With feelings, it's different.

435
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:18,291
Yeah, there are no feelings, guys.

436
00:24:18,291 --> 00:24:20,251
I kissed half of Rio de Janeiro!

437
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:25,715
Hey, he is cute, right, guys?

438
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:26,716
You think?

439
00:24:26,716 --> 00:24:28,634
I just think I'm desperate.

440
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:31,470
- I think so.
- So do I.

441
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:34,056
I started to dislike Renan now,

442
00:24:34,056 --> 00:24:36,517
I hope to dislike this one too.

443
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,186
But this one's cute.

444
00:24:38,311 --> 00:24:39,520
And he's nice.

445
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,982
There was one moment
I was short of breath.

446
00:24:42,982 --> 00:24:44,942
He saw it, came back,

447
00:24:44,942 --> 00:24:46,402
to check on me.

448
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:49,655
I can do better.

449
00:25:06,297 --> 00:25:08,591
Because, "You hook up with good guys."

450
00:25:08,758 --> 00:25:11,344
I just kiss them,
I get to know things later.

451
00:25:11,594 --> 00:25:12,929
I don't ask the names.

452
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:14,555
Okay.

453
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,975
Fuck. I'll say, "What's your name?
How old are you?

454
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,769
"What do you do?"

455
00:25:19,977 --> 00:25:23,397
There's those five-minute chats
before, right, Anna?

456
00:25:23,648 --> 00:25:24,523
This.

457
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:26,901
Nice to meet you. And take this.

458
00:25:27,485 --> 00:25:30,279
"I'm sorry, are you available?"
"Oh, I am."

459
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:32,448
You called me too.

460
00:25:32,448 --> 00:25:35,159
People talk too much. I don't know why.

461
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:37,119
No, that's good. Later, you...

462
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:39,997
You know you kissed some guy
who said that...

463
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:42,959
No, after kissing, kissing well, you talk.

464
00:25:42,959 --> 00:25:44,001
I get it.

465
00:25:44,001 --> 00:25:46,170
If the kissing was bad, you say,

466
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:49,048
"My friend is waiting
for me in the bathroom."

467
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:53,761
Let's go!

468
00:26:28,254 --> 00:26:29,213
Oh, fuck.

469
00:26:30,506 --> 00:26:31,841
Home.

470
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,927
I'm still online! I don't want to know.

471
00:26:34,927 --> 00:26:36,429
I'm still online...

472
00:26:36,429 --> 00:26:39,598
My dot is green,
I said I'm "Ramonline" today.

473
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:40,516
Home!

474
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:42,768
I'm gonna take a shower, then sleep.

475
00:26:43,978 --> 00:26:45,146
What?

476
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:54,697
Fuck! There's no food?

477
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:56,365
To the pool, baby.

478
00:26:56,490 --> 00:27:00,494
Come here, pumpkin
Go dancing in the gang...

479
00:27:18,429 --> 00:27:20,931
Guys, here's the thing.

480
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,768
I'd rather start too soon...

481
00:27:24,018 --> 00:27:28,064
I said, "They're already sleeping.
I want to go to the pagode party."

482
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:30,399
You could have laid down, man.

483
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,443
It deserves more.

484
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:34,487
Come here, buddy. Yeah?

485
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,113
Going upstairs?

486
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:37,406
Going upstairs too?

487
00:27:44,914 --> 00:27:46,874
Anna. Do you want to do this job?

488
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:50,086
- What do you want me to do?
- Moisturize my hair.

489
00:27:50,586 --> 00:27:52,797
Then I'll cuddle with you.

490
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:55,841
I'll cuddle with you later.

491
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:57,676
It's a good deal.

492
00:27:59,095 --> 00:28:00,638
I gotta get the thing.

493
00:28:11,065 --> 00:28:13,526
- Get more.
- What, baby?

494
00:28:13,526 --> 00:28:16,070
- I'm embarrassed.
- Why?

495
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:19,198
He said, "Moisturize my hair?"

496
00:28:19,198 --> 00:28:22,368
Are you being cute?

497
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:24,245
- I am cute.
- When?

498
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:25,704
Now.

499
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,164
That's the first time.

500
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:28,958
- I really am.
- No complaints.

501
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:31,335
He might want help to take a shower.

502
00:28:34,588 --> 00:28:36,006
Easy there, honey.

503
00:28:36,841 --> 00:28:38,426
The soap

504
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:40,052
is here.

505
00:28:49,311 --> 00:28:50,938
Tell me when you're done.

506
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:58,821
You're gonna have
to use this for five minutes.

507
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:03,159
- Five minutes?
- Yes.

508
00:29:07,079 --> 00:29:09,999
I look like a beauty salon, okay, honey?

509
00:29:09,999 --> 00:29:11,250
Fuck.

510
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:14,295
I'm gonna give you a little massage.

511
00:29:14,295 --> 00:29:16,005
Wet.

512
00:29:16,297 --> 00:29:17,923
Afraid of getting wet?

513
00:29:18,132 --> 00:29:19,550
Leave... Do a...

514
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,926
Is that it?

515
00:29:20,926 --> 00:29:22,094
It'll change.

516
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:23,804
Now you're gonna...

517
00:29:23,804 --> 00:29:25,389
Squeeze it.

518
00:29:26,474 --> 00:29:27,766
Put it here.

519
00:29:28,309 --> 00:29:31,437
Jeez, under the arm is like
a hair stylist.

520
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:37,610
After you remove this,
you'll have to use the hair conditioner.

521
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:39,862
The conditioner is on the floor.

522
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:41,530
Okay, honey?

523
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:42,656
There.

524
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:44,783
Check if it's a conditioner.

525
00:29:46,410 --> 00:29:47,995
Does it have a label?

526
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:50,664
Conditioner, soap.

527
00:29:50,664 --> 00:29:52,833
Take the shower by yourself.

528
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:54,919
I can't. Why? I didn't get it.

529
00:29:55,503 --> 00:29:57,588
You come here just to...

530
00:29:57,588 --> 00:29:59,006
I'm a nice person.

531
00:29:59,006 --> 00:30:01,509
What am I? I'll help you out,

532
00:30:01,509 --> 00:30:04,720
then you give me a massage.
You make me sleep.

533
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,013
I'll lay over there.

534
00:30:06,388 --> 00:30:07,806
You'll get the massage!

535
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:10,476
Please, that's the least you can do.

536
00:30:28,661 --> 00:30:31,747
I'm gonna do like Nathália.
Are you counting sheep?

537
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:33,040
Bullshit.

538
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,542
So, start counting.

539
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:36,835
Let's fuck.

540
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,547
- Let's fuck.
- No.

541
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,681
So?

542
00:30:48,973 --> 00:30:52,601
Jeez, I knew I'd hook up with you

543
00:30:53,018 --> 00:30:55,771
because everybody said so.

544
00:30:56,063 --> 00:30:57,731
They were right.

545
00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:01,068
What's up, bro? I don't get it.

546
00:31:01,610 --> 00:31:05,656
Tomorrow, we'll go to Ramon's
and stick our heads in a bucket.

547
00:31:07,116 --> 00:31:09,577
Are you gonna bullshit me?

548
00:31:13,038 --> 00:31:15,416
But there's a saying...

549
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:19,378
"It's better to apologize
than ask for permission."

550
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,383
Why?

551
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,969
Ramon, you're leaving tomorrow with Renan.

552
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:29,805
If you want it. You're the boss.

553
00:31:30,055 --> 00:31:33,058
You're bringing people,
I hook up with one at a time.

554
00:31:33,183 --> 00:31:34,560
Hooking up?

555
00:31:34,768 --> 00:31:37,354
You're under the quilt.

556
00:31:38,772 --> 00:31:41,233
That spoon thing is complicated, right?

557
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:43,902
No, he's trying to make me sleep.

558
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,405
- On his underwear.
- I'm good at this.

559
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:50,326
I trust the boy.

560
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:57,082
If one more of his friends come,
I'll leave.

561
00:31:58,667 --> 00:32:00,961
That's the way it goes, I'm not jealous.

562
00:32:32,785 --> 00:32:34,244
Are you okay, bro?

563
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:36,163
With your brother?

564
00:32:36,163 --> 00:32:38,082
- I'm fucking great.
- Fuck!

565
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:41,293
What about you? Did you have fun?

566
00:32:41,293 --> 00:32:43,128
Those guys are cool, right?

567
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,880
Yes, they're very cool, bro.

568
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:14,410
- Did you cum?
- Yes.

569
00:33:14,535 --> 00:33:16,161
Okay.

570
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:20,791
That boy is skinny,
but he's got it, right?

571
00:33:21,917 --> 00:33:24,378
They say skinny guys are...

572
00:33:25,587 --> 00:33:27,256
Right?

573
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:29,675
Were you in the Tiger Room?

574
00:33:29,675 --> 00:33:31,510
- What?
- Were you in the room?

575
00:33:31,719 --> 00:33:34,596
- Did you cum inside?
- No.

576
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:36,932
Okay.

577
00:33:37,391 --> 00:33:38,809
Why didn't you cum?

578
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:41,061
There you go.

579
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:42,479
Go for it.

580
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:44,648
- What?
- Go for it.

581
00:33:44,648 --> 00:33:47,401
You nailed it.
You didn't want to cum, okay.

582
00:33:47,609 --> 00:33:49,278
No, I wanted to, bro.

583
00:33:49,278 --> 00:33:50,821
It didn't come out?

584
00:33:51,947 --> 00:33:54,283
I was almost cumming... I had a cramp...

585
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:57,619
I swear. I had a cramp at the time.

586
00:33:57,619 --> 00:33:59,913
The scene is ridiculous.

587
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:01,540
You had a muscle pulled?

588
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:03,083
Was she on all fours?

589
00:34:03,083 --> 00:34:06,086
No, dude, I was seated
in the middle, like this...

590
00:34:06,086 --> 00:34:07,004
That's good.

591
00:34:07,129 --> 00:34:10,549
- I went a little harder.
- That position's great!

592
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:12,551
Dude, it just froze.

593
00:34:12,551 --> 00:34:15,471
What was I supposed to do?

594
00:34:15,471 --> 00:34:17,765
You keep going with the cramp.

595
00:34:18,348 --> 00:34:20,851
This position is really great.

596
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:33,864
Somebody clear this up for me.

597
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,366
What are we gonna do tonight?

598
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:38,035
Today...

599
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:40,037
Like...

600
00:34:40,037 --> 00:34:42,623
Say it. Yesterday was great.

601
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:46,043
- Amazing!
- Everybody's energy was fucking great.

602
00:34:46,460 --> 00:34:49,254
We had a fucking blast,
we got fucking wasted.

603
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:50,839
But today...

604
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:53,717
think about something beachfront.

605
00:34:53,717 --> 00:34:56,887
A penthouse. Just top notch people.

606
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:59,515
Top notch people...

607
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:00,516
The roof night!

608
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:03,560
My flight's in the morning.

609
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:06,688
Yeah, tonight must be the night.

610
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,442
Don't sleep.

611
00:35:10,442 --> 00:35:13,362
Probably, got it?

612
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:15,739
Are you leaving too?

613
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:18,575
No. Renatinho just got here.

614
00:35:27,876 --> 00:35:30,212
Girl!

615
00:35:32,506 --> 00:35:34,132
What's up?

616
00:35:35,843 --> 00:35:37,261
How are you?

617
00:35:37,386 --> 00:35:40,138
Don't you want to come here, girl? Come.

618
00:35:41,265 --> 00:35:44,184
I am... As far as possible.

619
00:35:44,184 --> 00:35:46,436
I'm wonderful.

620
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:48,814
But some things happened...

621
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:51,024
Luan is not here anymore.

622
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:53,110
Seriously, girl.

623
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:54,820
I'll catch a plane.

624
00:35:55,112 --> 00:35:57,364
Okay, girl. Hurry up.

625
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:58,949
See you tomorrow.

626
00:35:58,949 --> 00:36:00,534
Okay.

627
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:02,202
I'm fine.

628
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:05,455
- I love you.
- Love you too.

629
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:07,040
Kisses!

630
00:36:07,207 --> 00:36:08,125
Bye!

631
00:36:09,585 --> 00:36:10,419
Who?

632
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,298
A friend of mine, Mikaella.

633
00:36:14,298 --> 00:36:16,717
She's coming tomorrow.

634
00:36:16,717 --> 00:36:19,511
Oh, my God.

635
00:36:25,058 --> 00:36:27,269
Renan. Three words:

636
00:36:27,769 --> 00:36:28,979
Let's go!

637
00:36:29,271 --> 00:36:31,023
Renato must get in first.

638
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:32,983
Let's go!

639
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:34,610
It's two words, right?

640
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:36,904
Actually, it's two words.

641
00:36:36,904 --> 00:36:37,988
MOLE BEACH

642
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:40,365
Renato. You step up.

643
00:36:40,532 --> 00:36:42,284
Right foot, twice.

644
00:36:42,284 --> 00:36:45,120
Put your tongue on it in a sexy way,

645
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,330
hump a little.

646
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:47,956
God blessed.

647
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,666
Right foot.

648
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:52,044
That's for good luck.

649
00:36:52,252 --> 00:36:53,420
Fuck!

650
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,574
There's not gonna be enough girls

651
00:37:36,964 --> 00:37:38,298
Are we okay?

652
00:37:38,674 --> 00:37:40,425
Are we all okay together?

653
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:44,346
We're sisters.

654
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:45,973
So we can't do it.

655
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:04,658
Me too.

656
00:38:05,409 --> 00:38:07,661
I'm doing nothing.

657
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:43,530
Listen up.

658
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,115
I wanted to talk to you.

659
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:46,491
Shoot.

660
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,660
Why did you two go different ways?

661
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,579
I feel she's hurt

662
00:38:50,579 --> 00:38:53,874
because of what happened
between you two and stuff...

663
00:38:53,874 --> 00:38:56,793
Bro, something that killed my vibe

664
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:59,671
is that she said something

665
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:03,091
about Fernanda, when she wasn't there.
She teased the girl.

666
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:04,801
She was a guest of mine,

667
00:39:04,801 --> 00:39:07,471
she had to put up with jokes.

668
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:09,139
Nothing was cool.

669
00:39:09,139 --> 00:39:12,559
I'm gonna work this out.

670
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,644
When you got in the house,

671
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:17,230
you said Nath drew your attention.

672
00:39:17,773 --> 00:39:20,984
She did. We talked about this before.

673
00:39:20,984 --> 00:39:24,780
If you feel like hitting on her,
talk to her.

674
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,656
I have nothing to do with her.

675
00:39:26,782 --> 00:39:30,118
Renato, my brother,
and Nathália are another thing.

676
00:39:30,118 --> 00:39:32,037
I don't know what's going on.

677
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:34,331
Those chicks are together, you know?

678
00:39:34,331 --> 00:39:37,000
- I see they're friends.
- Before you...

679
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:39,586
You sound out to see what's going on.

680
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:41,296
That's what I'm doing.

681
00:39:41,296 --> 00:39:42,631
I don't know.

682
00:39:42,631 --> 00:39:45,008
You're my brother.

683
00:39:45,008 --> 00:39:47,719
You've come a long way to have fun.

684
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,387
Enjoy this however you want.

685
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:53,642
Now I'm gonna talk
to that blondie over there...

686
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,936
See you in the rooftop in a while.

687
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:03,902
Look, I need your help.

688
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,529
Why?

689
00:40:06,071 --> 00:40:07,989
Because it's you... Fuck.

690
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:10,200
You were supposed to control me.

691
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,744
What are you up to? Is it Nath?

692
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:16,414
Yeah. You knew... In the waterfall...

693
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:19,000
before I hit on Anna, I wanted her.

694
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:21,336
Did I tell you this too?

695
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:23,421
I told the boys, you know?

696
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:24,923
What do you think?

697
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:28,844
Wonderful. If Nath wants it,
you should go for it.

698
00:40:36,518 --> 00:40:38,770
Renato came to me and Bia and said,

699
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:42,691
"The first chick who drew my attention
was Nath."

700
00:40:42,691 --> 00:40:45,235
Then he just said, "What do I do?"

701
00:40:45,235 --> 00:40:48,280
No, he fucked her,
and went to hook up with Nath.

702
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:50,782
Would you hook up with him?

703
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:52,993
He couldn't hook up with Nath?

704
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:54,911
Would you?

705
00:40:55,203 --> 00:40:57,414
Not today, but tomorrow...

706
00:40:57,414 --> 00:40:59,499
That's it, buddy.

707
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:01,793
Let me tell you something.

708
00:41:02,294 --> 00:41:04,337
Do you know I hooked up with Anna?

709
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:07,716
But you were the first girl

710
00:41:07,716 --> 00:41:09,801
who drew my attention.

711
00:41:11,595 --> 00:41:13,847
I guess you don't know this, do you?

712
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:18,602
No, I get fucked up all the time, right?

713
00:41:23,481 --> 00:41:26,943
I could've told her, "Fuck,
I used to hook up with Anna."

714
00:41:28,904 --> 00:41:31,198
That's only said by drunk people.

715
00:41:31,198 --> 00:41:33,408
It's not worth it.

716
00:41:34,618 --> 00:41:36,453
But I get fucked up all the time.

717
00:41:36,453 --> 00:41:38,246
Bia hooked up with Renan,

718
00:41:38,246 --> 00:41:40,498
and I couldn't hook up with Luan.

719
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,293
And I can't hook up with you.

720
00:41:43,293 --> 00:41:46,463
Why can't you hook up with me?

721
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:49,382
Do you know what Tay told me?

722
00:41:49,382 --> 00:41:51,927
I told her...

723
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:54,054
She said something like, "Wait.

724
00:41:54,471 --> 00:41:57,182
"I'd hook up with this guy tomorrow!"

725
00:42:32,717 --> 00:42:33,760
It's over, honey.

726
00:42:33,969 --> 00:42:36,304
What did she misunderstand?

727
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:39,516
We didn't understand why she was crying.

728
00:42:39,516 --> 00:42:41,893
But all the problem was because Murilo

729
00:42:41,893 --> 00:42:43,853
misunderstood everything,

730
00:42:43,853 --> 00:42:46,189
He understood literally.

731
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:49,234
Like, "Tomorrow,
I'll hook up with the guy."

732
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:52,612
He misunderstood.

733
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:55,907
But, at the same time,
I understand his pain.

734
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:58,118
Because he likes her.

735
00:42:58,118 --> 00:42:59,160
He misunderstood.

736
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:02,539
He asked her to put herself in his shoes

737
00:43:02,539 --> 00:43:03,957
- and she did.
- Yes!

738
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:06,501
But then he misunderstood.

739
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:07,877
Did you get it?

740
00:43:08,003 --> 00:43:09,337
I did.

741
00:43:09,337 --> 00:43:11,840
Explain for us.

742
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,843
They were having a...
Hypothetically speaking,

743
00:43:14,843 --> 00:43:17,304
they put themselves in those boys' shoes.

744
00:43:17,304 --> 00:43:20,098
But he understood... Like it was Tay

745
00:43:20,098 --> 00:43:22,142
- answering.
- Yes!

746
00:43:22,142 --> 00:43:24,060
But it wasn't her.

747
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:27,439
Tay said she wouldn't do today,
just tomorrow.

748
00:43:27,439 --> 00:43:29,316
As if she were Anna.

749
00:43:29,566 --> 00:43:31,484
And he thought

750
00:43:31,484 --> 00:43:33,194
Tay wanted him.

751
00:43:33,194 --> 00:43:34,487
That's it.

752
00:43:34,487 --> 00:43:36,823
I was cut off like this at a party.

753
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:39,617
Do you think that person will think

754
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:43,121
- about cutting off?
- I know, girl.

755
00:43:43,121 --> 00:43:45,790
But I cut my leg because of this,

756
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:46,833
really!

757
00:43:46,833 --> 00:43:49,586
One chick did this, bang!

758
00:43:49,586 --> 00:43:51,921
She broke a bottle, it hit my leg.

759
00:43:51,921 --> 00:43:52,839
Don't do this!

760
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:55,133
I wish I was classy
to fight at home,

761
00:43:55,133 --> 00:43:57,510
take things, and throw them on the floor.

762
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,179
They must use plastic cups.

763
00:43:59,179 --> 00:44:01,306
She got angry!

764
00:44:01,306 --> 00:44:03,391
And threw the glass.

765
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:06,853
But I think she had an outburst.

766
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:08,229
Yeah, she did.

767
00:44:08,229 --> 00:44:10,231
But, man...

768
00:44:10,231 --> 00:44:12,984
I'm not standing for Tay,
but she was classy.

769
00:44:12,984 --> 00:44:16,738
Even arguing with Murilo,
she was very cool.

770
00:44:16,863 --> 00:44:18,907
I think she needed that.

771
00:44:18,907 --> 00:44:21,201
It was a huge misunderstanding.

772
00:44:21,201 --> 00:44:23,536
She tried to kick him in the bus.

773
00:44:23,536 --> 00:44:25,205
I forgot about that kick!

774
00:44:25,205 --> 00:44:27,207
Hit play, please!

775
00:44:27,207 --> 00:44:29,292
One, two, three and...

776
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:32,170
One for all and all for one!

777
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:35,173
IN THE NEXT EPISODE

778
00:44:35,173 --> 00:44:37,926
Take it or leave it. Let's go!

779
00:44:39,219 --> 00:44:40,845
In front of me?

780
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:42,806
If you love me, I won't.

781
00:44:46,184 --> 00:44:48,061
You're a clueless drunk.

782
00:44:48,186 --> 00:44:50,730
Totally clueless.

783
00:44:54,818 --> 00:44:56,319
Whoa!

784
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:58,571
You get what you give. See?

785
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:01,116
Jeez, guys. I've... I've seen it all.

786
00:45:01,116 --> 00:45:03,410
Renatinho made an impression.

787
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:06,204
Took everybody to the sex room.

788
00:45:06,371 --> 00:45:09,457
He got there to make an impression.
He nailed it.

789
00:45:09,457 --> 00:45:11,251
But he's not wrong, brother.

790
00:45:11,251 --> 00:45:12,168
Delivered.

791
00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:16,923
In the end, we praised Anna a lot, but...

792
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:19,634
In the end, she got involved. What I said.

793
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:22,554
She'd get out of that, if she knew.

794
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,974
We'll only know if she got involved

795
00:45:25,974 --> 00:45:27,350
on the next episode.

796
00:45:27,350 --> 00:45:29,352
She was kissing another guy!

797
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:31,229
She hooked up because of him.

798
00:45:31,396 --> 00:45:32,397
We don't know...

799
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:34,107
But it looked like that.

800
00:45:34,107 --> 00:45:35,400
Yes!

801
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:38,278
And why is Taynara so pissed?

802
00:45:38,445 --> 00:45:39,529
Why?

803
00:45:39,529 --> 00:45:42,157
We're gonna have to wait another week!

804
00:45:42,157 --> 00:45:43,491
It's over!

805
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:46,703
Guys, I'm glad it's over.

806
00:45:46,703 --> 00:45:48,913
My drink is over. I'm leaving.

807
00:45:48,913 --> 00:45:51,666
Let's drink at my place?
I'm cool, let's go.

808
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:53,418
Girl, give me a ride.

809
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:54,335
Let's go!

810
00:45:54,335 --> 00:45:55,462
Now we're talking.

811
00:45:55,462 --> 00:45:57,505
Let's play videogames, Carol?

812
00:45:57,505 --> 00:46:01,426
- Let's play?
- Let's.

813
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:03,595
I'm gonna give you my joystick.

814
00:46:05,388 --> 00:46:06,556
Let's do it.

815
00:46:06,556 --> 00:46:09,350
Let's talk something here, the two of us.

816
00:46:09,350 --> 00:46:11,561
Let's go there.
