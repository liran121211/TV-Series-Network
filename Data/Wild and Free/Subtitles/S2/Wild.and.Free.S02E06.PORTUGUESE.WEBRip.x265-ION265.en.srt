00:00:06,757 --> 00:00:09,552
There's more fighting today!
There's hooking up!

WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS 2
THE REVIEW

3
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:12,722
Oh, my God!

4
00:00:12,722 --> 00:00:16,559
- It's been so long, guys.
- Let's do one thing. Lower...

5
00:00:16,559 --> 00:00:18,728
- Thanks, Titto.
- That's indecent.

6
00:00:18,728 --> 00:00:21,355
- Come here.
- I don't want it.

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:26,235
Guys, the week went by slowly.
I prayed for today.

8
00:00:26,444 --> 00:00:28,863
- Me too.
- There's more fighting today.

9
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:32,616
Things will happen. Murilo, Tay, Bia,

10
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,869
Luan, who rubbed it into somebody's knee.

11
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:38,038
- I'm very anxious.
- Who had her knee rubbed into.

12
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,667
We don't know it for sure.
That's the question.

13
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,586
God, I'm anxious.

14
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:49,592
I'm very nervous because last episode
left me like this, very sensitive.

15
00:00:49,842 --> 00:00:54,555
- I wanna see it right now.
- She came dressed to a party.

16
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:59,518
It's a mix of Katy Perry and Ana Hickmann.

17
00:00:59,518 --> 00:01:01,312
- Thank you.
- You're wonderful.

18
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:05,858
- Lexa nailed it too.
- Carol is out of it.

19
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:09,779
I'm into... How can I call it?

20
00:01:09,779 --> 00:01:12,072
The WHO Princess.

21
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:16,202
Little WHO Princess. It's a mix
of Cruella and the Minions. I love it.

22
00:01:16,202 --> 00:01:20,331
- I'm following all recommendations.
- That's right, girl.

23
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:23,042
She's wearing a dream dress, see?

24
00:01:23,292 --> 00:01:27,379
Now, Jerry, it's a trigger warning
because we look very much alike.

25
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:31,509
Soldier of the future. Did you guys
arrange to come together?

26
00:01:31,509 --> 00:01:33,886
That's a sign. God.

27
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:38,557
Are you all right now?
I'm still catching my breath.

28
00:01:38,682 --> 00:01:42,311
No, I'm not. Looks like
the truck's still here, it hit me.

29
00:01:42,311 --> 00:01:45,856
Murilo tried to get back with Tay,
she put her foot down.

30
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:49,109
But it must be hard seeing
her boy with another girl.

31
00:01:49,109 --> 00:01:52,196
I think it's bothering him she's fine.

32
00:01:52,404 --> 00:01:56,700
Yeah, and they're classy,
because they're not arguing.

33
00:01:56,909 --> 00:01:59,203
There was that disagreement last week,

34
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:02,873
but she knows how to avoid this,
and he has nothing to say.

35
00:02:03,082 --> 00:02:08,420
Now, I'm very anxious to know about
the situation between Luan and Murilo.

36
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:14,510
- That scene at the end...
- And Bia was in it too, right? Poor girl.

37
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,513
- Too much booze.
- There was kind of a trip.

38
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:20,516
And you saw that
Bia believed Luan too, right?

39
00:02:20,683 --> 00:02:25,020
So, she thinks Murilo
rubbed it into her knee.

40
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:29,191
Guys, I wanna watch this episode.
I wanna see what happens.

41
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:32,820
- Let's watch it. Hit play.
- I'm gonna take my glasses off.

42
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:36,782
This is our review. No cuts.
Whatever we say, everyone will hear it!

43
00:02:36,907 --> 00:02:38,033
It's about this, girl.

44
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:41,161
I know. John is gonna be cancelled...
Let's hit play.

45
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:45,040
- Titto has to struggle, baby.
- Cancelled on Twitter?

46
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:47,710
Oh, my God, seriously.

47
00:02:57,344 --> 00:02:58,846
Is it gonna be just me?

48
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:01,265
You had sex. You gotta take it slow.

49
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,058
I heard her moaning.

50
00:03:03,058 --> 00:03:06,896
- I'm still hurt because of that.
- If you knew how much I'm hurt.

51
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:09,857
- Kissing is no big deal.
- Okay, fine.

52
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:15,237
I'm fine now. I know what I do
and what I don't, bro...

53
00:03:15,738 --> 00:03:21,243
That's not gonna lead me anywhere.
It just made me feel worse.

54
00:03:21,577 --> 00:03:27,124
But you must know that it really hurt me.
In a way I didn't think I'd feel.

55
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,084
Oh, that's cute.

56
00:03:29,585 --> 00:03:32,963
Tay, you're playing with me, man.

57
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,132
No, I play with my feelings.

58
00:03:35,132 --> 00:03:37,551
Guys, did you see... There, in love?

59
00:03:37,885 --> 00:03:42,890
- Completely.
- She was clear she still likes him.

60
00:03:43,265 --> 00:03:48,604
- He's not hiding that either.
- No, it's clear.

61
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:53,400
- I think they're breaking up. You know?
- Oh, that's enough.

62
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,402
I don't think so.

63
00:03:55,611 --> 00:03:59,573
I think they're gonna get married.
And we're gonna be invited.

64
00:04:00,282 --> 00:04:04,453
I'm gonna tell you not to come.
I'm gonna tell them not to invite you

65
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,789
because you're not being supportive.

66
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:11,293
No, because it's not just you!
You're not alone in this.

67
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,587
But why would I be messing with you?

68
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,589
I love you, motherfucker!

69
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,597
My God!

70
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:26,058
I love that "I love you", like that.

71
00:04:26,642 --> 00:04:31,063
- I got goosebumps.
- Me too. I love that mood...

72
00:04:31,063 --> 00:04:35,109
- I love that fighting mood...
- You know why?

73
00:04:35,567 --> 00:04:40,864
- It ends in "take this!"
- But, I wonder if they're gonna kiss...

74
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,492
I think she's gonna avoid that.

75
00:04:43,492 --> 00:04:47,579
Has anybody ever said or heard
a "I love you, motherfucker"? Like...

76
00:04:47,955 --> 00:04:49,331
I have.

77
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:52,751
- Have you heard it?
- And I kissed him afterwards.

78
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:54,211
And you kissed?

79
00:04:54,336 --> 00:04:58,757
She blinked and said, "What?"

80
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,968
No, girl, they're gonna kiss.

81
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,803
Let's see this, go. Hit play.

82
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:06,223
- I love you too. It hurts to say it.
- You don't...

83
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:10,436
If I didn't, I wouldn't be here now.
I'd be in the pool.

84
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:20,320
- What an awesome scene.
- I think she's playing games.

85
00:05:20,446 --> 00:05:24,950
"Do you think I'd be here
if I didn't love you?"

86
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:28,120
- She's playing games.
- I'm loving watching this.

87
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:31,874
- I wouldn't do it.
- I think she was honest.

88
00:05:31,874 --> 00:05:34,043
I wouldn't kiss him.

89
00:05:34,043 --> 00:05:36,545
I would, with my eyes closed.

90
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,756
- Where's the camera?
- There.

91
00:05:38,756 --> 00:05:40,215
Is there film?

92
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:42,760
Let's make good use of it.

93
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:53,604
I love the vibe
of taking pictures together.

94
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,357
Won't it come out?

95
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,402
- It's coming out.
- Let's take it.

96
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:01,820
Let's go upstairs.

97
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,322
Okay!

98
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:08,869
Before that picture is developed,
they'll have had sex, right?

99
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:12,706
Before the picture is done
they'll have sex.

100
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:26,428
- It happened.
- Guys, it happened!

101
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:30,390
Has any friend of yours ever had sex
with somebody by your side?

102
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,267
- Yes.
- Have you, guys?

103
00:06:32,267 --> 00:06:33,560
Oh, girl, no.

104
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:35,646
I have.

105
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:39,733
- Carol, how was it?
- I moved into a very small house.

106
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,402
His friend was there.
Should I send him away?

107
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:45,239
- What did you guys tell him?
- We had sex.

108
00:06:45,239 --> 00:06:47,491
Did you tell him to sleep?

109
00:06:47,699 --> 00:06:51,662
No, the guy was watching TV,
and I was by his side with his friend.

110
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,916
- But I wasn't moaning, you know?
- He was watching TV...

111
00:06:57,251 --> 00:06:59,545
Let's say it was this big. Right?

112
00:06:59,545 --> 00:07:03,090
- It was smaller.
- Okay, this size.

113
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:08,387
- Were you here by this side?
- It was from where you are up to here.

114
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:11,598
I'm the guy or the friend.
Were you there with the guy?

115
00:07:11,723 --> 00:07:13,976
I was closer. Take it easy...

116
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:18,105
- There was a couch here.
- I'm here watching TV.

117
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:20,607
- And the mattress...
- Here?

118
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:25,362
- And the guy didn't see you having sex?
- I don't know. I was covered.

119
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:31,326
- It'd be good if John got in that house.
- If I managed to get in that house...

120
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:35,164
He wouldn't be able
to get in that house. He's too tall.

121
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:36,957
You were a fighter!

122
00:07:37,166 --> 00:07:40,586
But he had a lot of sex, brother.

123
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:44,840
Carol? Do you want to tell us
something else? That's cool.

124
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:46,842
No...

125
00:07:48,427 --> 00:07:52,639
Look, a car is coming. It's a cab!

126
00:07:52,973 --> 00:07:55,017
- Oh, my God!
- Look at her hair!

127
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,519
Hey, Father Blond.

128
00:07:57,644 --> 00:08:00,147
Hi!

129
00:08:00,355 --> 00:08:03,150
'A' plus!

130
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:07,571
- Jeez, he's fine.
- He seems to be...

131
00:08:07,988 --> 00:08:10,199
- Congratulations.
- ...naughty!

132
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:11,825
He acts like a player.

133
00:08:12,034 --> 00:08:13,160
Good morning!

134
00:08:13,869 --> 00:08:16,830
- I think Anna liked him.
- I think he's wonderful.

135
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,875
John gives himself completely.

136
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,669
I love it.

137
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:27,799
- Girl, what a good kiss, right?
- That was a good kiss, I think.

138
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,427
Bro, you're awesome.

139
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,971
- Oh, my God.
- What?

140
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,515
What's this, bro?

141
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:38,936
What?

142
00:08:40,771 --> 00:08:42,189
Is that for real?

143
00:08:42,189 --> 00:08:44,233
That's why I'm quiet.

144
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:47,402
- Bro, "awesome".
- I know.

145
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:49,947
Jeez. Guys, do you see what I see?

146
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:52,699
- Wait. Hit pause!
- Do you see what I see?

147
00:08:52,699 --> 00:08:54,785
Did you hear what she said?

148
00:08:55,911 --> 00:08:58,413
Ramon's friend has lost his mind.

149
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,459
Ramon's friend said to me
I was his first option.

150
00:09:02,459 --> 00:09:03,502
Look!

151
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:08,090
No, but no kissing.

152
00:09:08,298 --> 00:09:10,384
Jeez, bro. What a trip.

153
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:13,053
It's just you!

154
00:09:14,012 --> 00:09:15,347
Dude!

155
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:17,557
He said he really wants me.

156
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:19,309
He said "first option"?

157
00:09:19,434 --> 00:09:21,895
- Get a grip!
- I'm gonna kiss her!

158
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,814
Jeez, man.

159
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:29,528
- What did he say?
-"I'm gonna kiss her."

160
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:35,617
Yes, to Anna. I guess he's thinking
about breaking up with her.

161
00:09:36,326 --> 00:09:40,038
He wants to break up with her,
he wants to be free...

162
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:44,042
- and he's making excuses...
- Making excuses to be rid of that.

163
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:47,713
Instead of saying, "I want to be free."

164
00:09:47,713 --> 00:09:52,301
I got it, but it goes against
what he said, his apologies...

165
00:09:52,301 --> 00:09:54,177
He wants her,

166
00:09:54,177 --> 00:09:58,390
he wants to do whatever he wants,
but he doesn't wanna lose her.

167
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:03,312
- He wants to own her. It's like this.
- Then he makes excuses...

168
00:10:04,229 --> 00:10:08,317
- Girl, that's gonna be very fucked up.
- They're gonna fuck things up.

169
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,902
- It's now, honey.
- Tay's crying.

170
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:14,531
- Tay is drunk.
- Renan is doing... She is crying.

171
00:10:16,158 --> 00:10:19,578
- No, forget this, for God's sake.
- He had sex with a girl.

172
00:10:19,703 --> 00:10:23,332
I tried to get over it,
but my heart is in pain.

173
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,543
Taynara!

174
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:27,711
Stop, Taynara!

175
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:31,048
The person that's wonderful
is Ramon, like...

176
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:32,632
Ramon is sharp.

177
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,301
Ramon with his hands up.

178
00:10:34,301 --> 00:10:36,094
Ramon is lost.

179
00:10:36,219 --> 00:10:38,513
I'm gonna mind my own business.

180
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:40,432
I'll be quiet.

181
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:56,698
- I'm shocked.
- Tay lost her argument because...

182
00:10:56,698 --> 00:11:02,204
- She was very classy the last few days.
- Imagine what she's been through.

183
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,206
She was repressing her feelings.

184
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:07,501
I don't understand,
because he didn't do anything!

185
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:11,880
That's crazy, Tay coming at Murilo, but...

186
00:11:11,880 --> 00:11:15,384
At least she missed that kick.
That's something good.

187
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:17,636
Ask me if I've ever hit somebody.

188
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:21,640
Tell us, have you ever argued
because of jealousy?

189
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:26,603
Because you were jealous of your boy
or a girl was jealous of her boy with you?

190
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:29,940
So, I was the mistress of a guy,
I was a mistress...

191
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:31,233
Holy shit.

192
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:35,362
We respected each other a lot, you know?

193
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:40,700
- Yeah, I imagine.
- Yeah, we really respected each other.

194
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,745
And we had some arrangements, right?

195
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:48,250
Like. Yeah, turn off your phone
when you get in my house.

196
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,545
- Forget the world outside and all.
- Lover's code.

197
00:11:51,837 --> 00:11:54,423
Yes. Then he got there,

198
00:11:54,423 --> 00:11:58,051
we went to bed and started making love.

199
00:11:58,051 --> 00:12:00,512
- That's beautiful.
- We started making love.

200
00:12:00,887 --> 00:12:04,307
- Then, the phone started ringing.
- Yours?

201
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:08,687
His wife was calling him,
and we were having sex.

202
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:13,108
The thing was inside me
and he picked it up.

203
00:12:14,025 --> 00:12:17,654
-"The thing was inside me"?
- The phone rang, and he picked it up.

204
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:20,699
- And the thing was happening?
- He picked it up.

205
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:23,618
I didn't understand
about the fight being jealous.

206
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:27,581
- Oh, you're getting there?
- You were jealous.

207
00:12:27,581 --> 00:12:30,208
Then I said, "Are you crazy?"

208
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:33,879
He was on the phone on top of me.

209
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,382
I took the phone off his hand
and threw it on the floor.

210
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:42,929
Then he got up and screamed at me
for the first time. He was a calm person.

211
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:46,641
Then he got up and said, "Are you crazy?"

212
00:12:46,892 --> 00:12:50,061
- You said, "My grandma is crazy."
- Then I got scared.

213
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:54,983
He scared me, screaming at me.
I thought he was gonna hit me.

214
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:58,111
He'd never shouted.
And I pushed him down the stairs.

215
00:12:59,404 --> 00:13:02,240
But that was because I got scared.

216
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,660
- Because you got scared?
- The question is, is he alive?

217
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,289
It's very disrespectful.
I had been with him for three years...

218
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:13,960
"How disrespectful you answer
your wife's call while you're fucking me."

219
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:16,213
You fucked him for three years?

220
00:13:16,505 --> 00:13:21,760
- Yes, man. It was a long affair.
- Let's see what...

221
00:13:22,093 --> 00:13:23,845
- I'm curious.
- Please!

222
00:13:24,304 --> 00:13:25,388
Play.

223
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,558
Baby, why are you here?

224
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:32,437
- Why are you here?
- This is not gonna happen.

225
00:13:32,938 --> 00:13:36,900
- Oh, seriously.
- Jeez, he's mad at her. Why, bro?

226
00:13:37,108 --> 00:13:38,610
She didn't do anything.

227
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,364
What is it?

228
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,741
- Is he crying?
- It looks like it.

229
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:50,497
It's always like this. When he realizes
what he's done, he starts to cry,

230
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,791
- and makes a scene...
- Excuse me?

231
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,209
Oh, guys...

232
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:55,961
Can you excuse me?

233
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:59,089
Guys, boring!

234
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:01,341
Why are you being rude to me?

235
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:04,469
I'd have gone away and...

236
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,721
There's no "you and me" anymore.

237
00:14:07,138 --> 00:14:10,225
- What do you mean?
- No way.

238
00:14:10,225 --> 00:14:12,310
There's no "you and me" anymore.

239
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,897
God. What... What an idiot.

240
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,191
- Why are you saying this?
- Idiots.

241
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:20,193
Jeez, sis.

242
00:14:20,193 --> 00:14:23,196
Leave me alone, bro. I'm silent.

243
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:26,825
Can you do this? You saint!

244
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,118
Saint?

245
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:36,334
Bia, don't go after him.
For God's sake, listen to me.

246
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:37,794
Listen to me.

247
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:40,589
Fuck you and everybody.

248
00:14:40,589 --> 00:14:43,133
You're all crazy. All crazy.

249
00:14:43,133 --> 00:14:45,302
"I am Nathália. You're all crazy."

250
00:14:45,302 --> 00:14:50,557
But have you noticed all that tension
got worse because of Luan?

251
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,560
- All that tension...
- I gotta tell you.

252
00:14:53,685 --> 00:14:58,732
Congrats to Ramon and Nat
for their relationship, bro.

253
00:14:58,732 --> 00:15:00,650
I gotta tell you.

254
00:15:01,526 --> 00:15:05,447
Nath, I'm sorry if I judged you
last vacation, that's it.

255
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,075
Why are you sleeping here?

256
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:15,624
We're gonna sleep together.

257
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,835
Can you take the hand off?

258
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,342
Did he hit her?

259
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:28,136
- Did he hit the bed or her?
- He hit her.

260
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:30,639
Don't do what?

261
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,767
Don't do what?

262
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:36,478
Beatriz, go fuck yourself!

263
00:15:36,478 --> 00:15:38,647
You go fuck yourself!

264
00:15:38,647 --> 00:15:43,568
Fuck, what a wacko! Fuck you...

265
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:46,071
What's this? Bia!

266
00:15:46,071 --> 00:15:48,239
What's this?

267
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:52,243
You wanna kill me?

268
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,663
Bia, don't tease him right now.

269
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:59,876
- Stop it!
- Lock yourself, girl.

270
00:15:59,876 --> 00:16:03,004
Bia went to the bathroom.

271
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:05,423
Guys...

272
00:16:05,882 --> 00:16:07,884
Guys, that's terrible.

273
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:10,053
Jeez, man.

274
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:14,432
No, Luan! For God's sake, Luan!

275
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:17,227
Oh, Lord.

276
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:20,605
Are you gonna hit me? You can hit me.

277
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,190
You can hit me.

278
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:27,028
What's this... Bro!

279
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:28,363
What's this?

280
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:31,658
What's that? Oh, my God!

281
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,536
Murilo, can you take your hand off me?

282
00:16:34,869 --> 00:16:37,163
Pause!

283
00:16:37,414 --> 00:16:39,749
I agree with Titto when he said

284
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:43,545
Luan wants to possess the girl
and wants to hook up with others.

285
00:16:43,878 --> 00:16:47,507
He's making up situations
to hook up with others, you know?

286
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:52,303
He didn't know
how to arrange that with her.

287
00:16:52,303 --> 00:16:56,683
He wants to be free
but doesn't want her to be, you know?

288
00:16:56,808 --> 00:17:00,729
He makes up situations,
so he can hook up with other chicks.

289
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:05,525
Man, it's... That was expected.
That was coming...

290
00:17:05,525 --> 00:17:10,321
Last week, with the knee thing,
the way he talked to Bia,

291
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:14,117
the pussy thing, that was a sign
he wanted to control Bia.

292
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:17,454
It's all wrong, it's disgusting,
a damn thing, you know?

293
00:17:17,454 --> 00:17:23,501
It's like Titto said, when he's sober,
he's nice, but when he drinks, bro...

294
00:17:23,793 --> 00:17:27,630
Pabllo, what would you do
if this happens with you?

295
00:17:27,756 --> 00:17:30,675
Jeez, I'd say, "Let's seek some therapy...

296
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:36,055
"because It's not only affecting you,
it's affecting the atmosphere,

297
00:17:36,222 --> 00:17:39,309
-"friends." That's horrible.
- It's even more toxic.

298
00:17:39,434 --> 00:17:41,060
That's sad, guys.

299
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,104
I won't let you go.

300
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:46,608
My God!

301
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,401
What's this? Don't do this!

302
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:51,029
You hit me with your elbow.

303
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:52,655
My God!

304
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:53,656
Fuck!

305
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,200
Fuck!

306
00:17:55,325 --> 00:17:58,328
- There's no reason for that, man.
- Guys...

307
00:17:58,328 --> 00:18:00,205
this was a fucking assault.

308
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:02,499
Guys, security!

309
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:04,125
He hit remorselessly.

310
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:08,463
A hit with an elbow like that
can knock somebody out.

311
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:11,591
- He injured Murilo.
- He's bleeding!

312
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:13,885
Murilo's mouth is bleeding.

313
00:18:14,511 --> 00:18:18,097
- Oh, poor Mu, man.
- I feel sorry for Murilo.

314
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:21,559
- Jeez, poor Mu.
- He was trying to help...

315
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,229
- Murilo is showing her...
- His mouth's injured.

316
00:18:24,229 --> 00:18:28,233
What would he have the courage
to do to her?

317
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:30,193
He's looking for Luan.

318
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:32,487
How is it gonna be in the house?

319
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,908
Bro, he hit Murilo's face
with his elbow twice, man.

320
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:40,453
He can't be a boyfriend, nor a friend.

321
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:43,957
Seriously... I don't remember
who said he has a problem, right?

322
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:46,292
Maybe he has a problem with Murilo.

323
00:18:46,751 --> 00:18:49,546
Murilo was hugging him
while he was crying.

324
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:53,132
But the guy was helping him,
so that he wouldn't screw up.

325
00:18:53,132 --> 00:18:56,094
Remember Murilo fought
with him last vacation.

326
00:18:56,094 --> 00:19:01,099
You take two hits in the face
with an elbow, are you gonna be still?

327
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:05,687
- That guy lost his mind.
- If people thought there was a script,

328
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,189
- they were wrong.
- But, really...

329
00:19:08,189 --> 00:19:13,528
If that happens in real life...
Sure this is real, but it's being filmed.

330
00:19:13,736 --> 00:19:18,741
You're camping with ten friends...

331
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:22,954
one guy hits another,
what do you do? Send him home!

332
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:26,457
- Either I go or he goes.
- Obviously.

333
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:29,586
But I think everyone has been in
or has a friend

334
00:19:29,586 --> 00:19:33,506
who's been in a toxic relationship
with an abusive boyfriend.

335
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:38,052
What happens that's really fucked up...

336
00:19:38,052 --> 00:19:40,805
You then start to cut the couple off.

337
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:44,517
Until your friend understands
she's not the problem...

338
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:49,731
- But you have to be honest with her.
- That's it, I'd tell...

339
00:19:49,731 --> 00:19:51,024
Carol, and you?

340
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,528
I was in an abusive relationship
for many years.

341
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,448
I didn't know I was
in an abusive relationship.

342
00:19:58,448 --> 00:20:01,993
Carol must be 126 years old, I think,
and she doesn't tell us.

343
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:06,122
When I was young, you know?

344
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:12,003
It always starts with little things.

345
00:20:12,003 --> 00:20:17,300
And my friends started
to cut me off, got it?

346
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:19,177
Because of the other person.

347
00:20:19,177 --> 00:20:22,347
He starts to talk about
your clothes, your makeup,

348
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:26,434
hides your perfume
because the scent is strong, right?

349
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:29,437
When did you realize it?

350
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:33,107
Girl, I was used to forgiving him.

351
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:37,570
One day, the person makes a scene,

352
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:42,367
the other, he cries,
"Oh, forgive me, because I don't..."

353
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:46,913
Then you feel sorry for him.
You're in that relationship for years...

354
00:20:46,913 --> 00:20:52,669
I had a friend who took one year to
realize her husband was cheating on her.

355
00:20:52,669 --> 00:20:56,547
Even while cheating on her,
he was very abusive,

356
00:20:56,547 --> 00:20:59,592
he made a lot of trouble...
He was disrespectful.

357
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:05,682
We didn't want to go her place.
If he arrived, we'd leave.

358
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:10,228
I tell people who are watching this.
If you know somebody in this situation,

359
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:14,649
give the person a hint,
open the person's eyes, tell the person,

360
00:21:14,649 --> 00:21:17,527
because there's a lot of people
who still think

361
00:21:17,527 --> 00:21:22,699
that you're not supposed to interfere
in a couple's argument. But you are!

362
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:27,704
Bia, because, many times
she wasn't aware what was going on.

363
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:31,916
- I'm sure she wasn't aware.
- We're watching, you know?

364
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:37,296
There are a lot of women that,
unfortunately, don't have that option.

365
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:42,927
Because, unfortunately,
women have difficulty

366
00:21:42,927 --> 00:21:47,306
in being financially independent,
you know?

367
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:52,061
That's why I support all women
to be independent, you know?

368
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:58,109
And the most important, Jerry, for us
who are straight. We have to end this.

369
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:01,946
If a friend tells sexist jokes
that embarrass women,

370
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:06,951
even if he's your friend, you have
to make him realize he's talking bullshit.

371
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:09,370
You're free to say he's wrong.

372
00:22:09,537 --> 00:22:13,332
Sometimes you have a neighbor
going through this.

373
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:18,421
So, it's nice to understand
what's going on these days around us.

374
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:22,175
And really help, you know?
So, I hope this episode

375
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:27,889
encourages people to understand
what's the right thing to do.

376
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:31,142
That we can educate people.

377
00:22:33,519 --> 00:22:35,646
What would you do if you were me?

378
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:41,444
I wouldn't have given a second chance.
I would have broken up the first time.

379
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:44,989
Guys, this is an abusive relationship.

380
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,867
I can't handle this.

381
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:52,413
It's hard to end this.
You have to want it really bad.

382
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:54,415
You have to really want it.

383
00:22:55,041 --> 00:23:00,379
Bia knows it, right, man? You see
she doesn't say anything. She's hurt, man.

384
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,507
Everybody is trying to understand.

385
00:23:02,507 --> 00:23:05,426
But they can't understand,
there's no explanation.

386
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:08,137
That's the crazy thing about that.

387
00:23:08,346 --> 00:23:10,264
There's no explanation.

388
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:19,607
Amazon Prime Video concluded that
Luan could not remain in the show.

389
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,026
- Way to go, Amazon.
- Yay! Cheers.

390
00:23:22,235 --> 00:23:23,486
That's it, guys.

391
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:28,199
Amazon Prime Video concluded that
Luan could not remain in the show.

392
00:23:28,324 --> 00:23:30,284
Yeah. That's complicated.

393
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,663
Hey, guys.

394
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:34,997
Sit down, bitch.

395
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:41,587
I made a terrible mistake.
I don't remember what I did, but I did.

396
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:45,675
I don't even know if I wanna watch this.
I'm very sorry.

397
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:49,887
I'm gonna let you guys
enjoy your vacation...

398
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:52,348
Damn, very well.

399
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,684
Mu, we're bros, okay?

400
00:23:54,684 --> 00:23:58,729
I don't wanna get in anybody's way
in the house. I'm very sorry.

401
00:23:59,021 --> 00:24:02,692
I'm gonna pack and I'd like
to hug you all before I leave.

402
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:04,402
Jeez, cool.

403
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:07,029
I made a terrible mistake, but I love you!

404
00:24:07,155 --> 00:24:09,115
He manned up.

405
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:10,992
Oh, guys, I feel like crying.

406
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:14,620
- It seemed to be honest, guys.
- I think so too.

407
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:20,168
He had a cool attitude right now,
you know? He understands he needs help.

408
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:25,631
- He said he's gonna try to help himself.
- He needed that, and he had the attitude.

409
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:30,303
That's very hard, when you're wrong,
to admit that you're...

410
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:35,516
It's because you have to be humble.
People don't like to be humble.

411
00:24:35,892 --> 00:24:39,353
They wanna act like,
"I'm fucking awesome."

412
00:24:39,478 --> 00:24:42,523
- But he nailed it...
- What he did was horrible,

413
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:46,027
but he had a cool attitude now
for saying that.

414
00:24:46,027 --> 00:24:51,699
We have to understand
that the house's atmosphere was horrible.

415
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:56,704
Because of Luan and Bia. She could not
have fun and he will take care of himself.

416
00:24:56,704 --> 00:25:00,875
Bia has the chance to enjoy her vacation.
Then the house will be cool.

417
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:03,920
I thought Murilo was very noble

418
00:25:04,128 --> 00:25:08,257
when he embraced Luan like a brother,
and said, "Cry. You made a mistake."

419
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:11,510
Even after being hit three times
in the face, man.

420
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:16,307
He was very noble. Once again,
he realized that guy had a problem.

421
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:18,059
What do you think?

422
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:24,106
I think Murilo is the oldest in the house.
So he's way more experienced.

423
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:29,195
You can see by his conversation with Tay,
it's different from other couples.

424
00:25:29,195 --> 00:25:32,114
I expected that. But it was very nice

425
00:25:32,114 --> 00:25:35,952
because we know that, deep down,
Luan had a problem

426
00:25:35,952 --> 00:25:38,663
that nobody understood why.

427
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:44,377
And he forgot everything to stand for it.
I think that, if it were Ramon

428
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:47,838
instead of Luan, or anybody else,
he'd do the same thing.

429
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:51,801
I thought that was very cool.
I want Murilo hanging out with me!

430
00:25:52,051 --> 00:25:53,511
Bia will have fun!

431
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:56,430
Do you think she's gonna go wild?

432
00:25:56,430 --> 00:26:00,101
Now the vibe's gonna be relaxed,
a good vibe!

433
00:26:00,101 --> 00:26:03,604
Let's run a sweepstake.
Who thinks Bia will...

434
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,898
Would you hook up with anybody, Carol?

435
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:08,985
Oh, I get over really fast.

436
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:12,488
I don't have time to waste.
I cry and do it.

437
00:26:15,116 --> 00:26:18,744
-"I have sex crying," right, Carol?
- Yes, right.

438
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:19,954
Play!

439
00:26:20,288 --> 00:26:26,252
IN THE NEXT EPISODE

440
00:26:26,877 --> 00:26:28,212
What?

441
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,219
In my face?

442
00:26:35,386 --> 00:26:38,431
There are some guys
who think you're an athlete,

443
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:41,058
that you open the spaghetti...

444
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:44,687
Lexa...
