1
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:08,551
- Oh, my God. Episode two!
- You guys are so anxious, man!

2
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:09,719
I missed this a lot.

3
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:11,595
Fells like we're at a party.

4
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:18,185
- She comes in singing.
- Jerry's gonna sit down, easy.

5
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:23,649
- Jerry's hotter each day.
- Damn, you're all dressed up today.

6
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:25,735
- For episode 2.
- Where did you come from?

7
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:27,486
Fashion week.

8
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:33,284
- In my bedroom.
- We are honoring last week's party.

9
00:00:33,284 --> 00:00:36,245
I said she's dressed up, not you.
Get over yourself.

10
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:38,706
I'm not talking to you.
Go ahead.

11
00:00:38,706 --> 00:00:41,876
- Get over yourself.
- I'm gonna send our chat history.

12
00:00:42,001 --> 00:00:43,419
You wanna get back together?

13
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:44,712
No! Don't do this!

14
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:47,131
I want to see episode two now, guys.

15
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:50,718
I'm dying to know what happened
to Murilo and Tay.

16
00:00:50,718 --> 00:00:53,888
Because they started like that,
and now what?

17
00:00:54,138 --> 00:00:57,683
Exactly. Let me ask you guys this.
Do you think they can fix this?

18
00:00:57,892 --> 00:01:02,396
Because Murilo hooked up with a girl
in front of Tay. Will she forgive him?

19
00:01:02,563 --> 00:01:08,110
If I were her, absolutely.
A second pair of eyes never hurts.

20
00:01:08,486 --> 00:01:13,199
She hooked up with a guy too.
She just dismissed him.

21
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,774
WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS 2

22
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:27,356
Murilo...

23
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:29,942
- Murilo, are you busy?
- Yes, I am.

24
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,278
He's frying mine.

25
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:41,787
- Are you going somewhere? You four?
- Yes.

26
00:02:44,623 --> 00:02:47,042
Go on. Enjoy!

27
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,714
I'm watching you.
If you betray me, there's no coming back.

28
00:02:53,132 --> 00:02:55,467
We're going for a ride.

29
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:59,096
Bye, boys!

30
00:02:59,555 --> 00:03:02,057
Kisses!

31
00:03:05,102 --> 00:03:07,021
Great girl in a great car.

32
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:08,939
Cool girl in a cool car.

33
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,191
Girl, today you're driving our car!

34
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:13,485
I trust you, girl!

35
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:15,696
Go, princess.

36
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,197
From dumpster, right?

37
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,241
Go, Mother Lucinda.

38
00:03:19,742 --> 00:03:21,410
Mother Lucinda.

39
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,121
- Who's Mother Lucinda?
- Who?

40
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,668
I woke up great this morning.

41
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:33,380
Course, you had sex... All relaxed.

42
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,341
I woke up great, I'm cool.

43
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,677
- You nailed it.
- Not saying anything...

44
00:03:38,802 --> 00:03:40,304
- That's it.
- That's it.

45
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:42,056
That's it.

46
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:44,558
She said you were teasing her.

47
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:46,727
Getting close to the guy she was with.

48
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:48,520
Then I said...

49
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:51,523
When we got there...

50
00:03:51,523 --> 00:03:54,318
I was the first one to say hi
to that fucking DJ.

51
00:03:54,485 --> 00:03:59,823
When I was talking to him,
she hadn't hooked up with him yet.

52
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:03,160
What's wrong with this, bro? Fuck it.

53
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,876
Girl, after what happened yesterday,

54
00:04:11,293 --> 00:04:14,755
how are you and Murilo?

55
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,591
- What are you gonna do?
- You guys aren't talking.

56
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:21,178
He's not looking at my face,
but, girl, I'm cool.

57
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:26,183
- He's very mature, right?
- No. I told you what was gonna happen.

58
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:29,687
I told him to wait for the first party.

59
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:34,358
The first party, he drank
and did what he wanted, you know?

60
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:38,320
Now I can do whatever I want.
Now, it's... Yeah.

61
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,740
Girl, do you think he really hit on her?
It's easy to say...

62
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,618
Kissing is not a big deal.
Girl, he had sex.

63
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:49,081
He had sex with her in our room.
This is over for me.

64
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:52,835
There's no feelings involved in kissing,
but sharing the energy of sex

65
00:04:52,835 --> 00:04:56,463
is hard for me. This is hard, you know?

66
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:59,008
I didn't know he had sex with her.

67
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:02,636
If he cared about me,
he wouldn't have had sex.

68
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,681
Girl, wait. You had sex with others too.

69
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:08,308
Girl, it wasn't in the same house.

70
00:05:17,109 --> 00:05:20,404
- Did you get the cover-up?
- Sun! I got it.

71
00:05:32,374 --> 00:05:38,338
Murilo was with his chick. Nath was with
her boy who looks like a grandfather.

72
00:05:39,006 --> 00:05:41,592
I don't know where you were.

73
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:44,219
I'm a mother now, show some respect.

74
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:51,518
Then Murilo started...
He was expecting you to do something.

75
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:56,190
Then you did, he did too. I saw that,
I didn't need to interfere.

76
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,736
- But you're wonderful.
- It seemed he was bragging.

77
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,863
Bragging. Obviously, they're like this.

78
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:07,409
I said, "Bro, I wasn't expecting anything,
man. You don't even know what happened."

79
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:09,995
It happened, well...

80
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:13,540
- We do worse stuff.
- Murilo, you waited for nothing.

81
00:06:13,665 --> 00:06:18,253
- Be cool, I'm not talking to you, buddy.
- Waited for nothing.

82
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,799
I'm not talking to you, you know?

83
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:25,302
Be cool. You have no say in my life.

84
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:27,554
You know?

85
00:06:27,805 --> 00:06:32,518
Oh, girl. I think I like the boys,
but they're stupid, you know?

86
00:06:32,518 --> 00:06:35,771
They don't know
how to treat a woman right.

87
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:39,274
I think you really had to stand up for me.

88
00:06:39,274 --> 00:06:43,278
As usual. Every one of them
thinks this way. Always!

89
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,739
I think you really have to interfere.

90
00:06:45,739 --> 00:06:49,368
- Oh, girl, like...
- One for all, and all for one!

91
00:06:49,368 --> 00:06:52,663
Let's leave? Let's dress up, right, guys?

92
00:06:52,663 --> 00:06:55,457
Nothing in life is easy.

93
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:11,098
Hey, we're back.

94
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:19,731
Guys, they didn't even put
the catsup away.

95
00:07:21,024 --> 00:07:25,946
Everybody's asleep. I'm gonna have
to work. Bro, that's impossible.

96
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,328
I'm here.

97
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:36,331
We're gonna work.

98
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,585
- Now.
- Really, why?

99
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:42,963
Everybody's gonna have to...
I'm gonna change and leave.

100
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,757
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

101
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:49,428
I imagined this was gonna happen.

102
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,763
The work is at night.

103
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:03,275
Murilo, the girls have to work,

104
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,444
today is our day off.

105
00:08:05,444 --> 00:08:07,613
That's true. Wonderful.

106
00:08:07,613 --> 00:08:10,991
I asked for whiskey and a hip-hop night.
To remember old times.

107
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:14,661
Yeah, I miss this. I think this is right.

108
00:08:16,371 --> 00:08:19,625
Let's go. Everybody is beautiful
and full of colors.

109
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:33,639
- Come on, guys?
- Pay for our drinks, come on.

110
00:08:33,847 --> 00:08:35,849
Pay for our sins.

111
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:38,727
Bye, pretty boys!

112
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:43,690
Honey!

113
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:12,261
You have to ask those girls, guys.

114
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,179
Do you wanna drink something?

115
00:09:14,179 --> 00:09:17,099
- We ordered...
- For Tay.

116
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:19,184
The one with hair in braids.

117
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:24,856
Yeah, where's she? If you can find her,
it's been 25 minutes.

118
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,483
What did you order?

119
00:09:26,483 --> 00:09:31,780
- We ordered three gins.
- Sorry, today is hectic.

120
00:09:32,281 --> 00:09:37,202
- Actually, there's few people to serve.
- Yeah, just two.

121
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:39,496
Oh, no, two over here and two there.

122
00:09:39,621 --> 00:09:43,542
- Aren't the boys gonna work tonight?
- No, they should show up later.

123
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:47,045
Girl, I'm sweating. My armpit is sweating.

124
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:51,550
- Who already made 20,000?
- Since you noticed they're taking long,

125
00:09:51,717 --> 00:09:54,553
switch with them,
I wanna see this flowing.

126
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:57,097
Wait, I have to remember
how to fix drinks.

127
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:59,599
Ask them to explain this to you.

128
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,810
- Okay.
- But quickly.

129
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,480
- I asked for two gins.
- Take these for me. You're gonna switch.

130
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,399
- Who's this for?
- I'll show you.

131
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:11,153
The gin is for the last table.
A blond couple

132
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:15,365
and a lady wearing a white
long-sleeve blouse. Those two, okay?

133
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:16,992
Okay.

134
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:20,537
Let me take the beers, girl.
Fix the drinks.

135
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:21,955
I don't remember.

136
00:10:21,955 --> 00:10:24,750
Girl, gin and tonic, for God's sake.

137
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,210
- It's caipirinha!
- Just squeeze some lime.

138
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:32,382
- Where's our gin?
- I gave you two gins, now two caipirinhas.

139
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:35,635
No. Two caipirinhas for her.

140
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:39,598
But we actually ordered three gins
and two caipirinhas.

141
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:44,770
I gave you two gins.
Two gins and two caipirinhas.

142
00:10:44,895 --> 00:10:48,148
- But did you order from Tay?
- Yes, where's she?

143
00:10:48,315 --> 00:10:51,234
- She's at the bar now. We switched.
- She knows.

144
00:10:51,234 --> 00:10:54,071
She told us two.

145
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,824
- Okay!
- I'm gonna confirm this.

146
00:10:57,824 --> 00:11:00,160
No problem.

147
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,456
Let me teach you a trick. Now you're gonna
pour the vodka and count to ten.

148
00:11:04,456 --> 00:11:07,918
Take the dosing cup off.
Pour the vodka in there.

149
00:11:07,918 --> 00:11:12,381
- Count to ten, go.
- One, two, three... eight, nine, ten.

150
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:15,342
Pour it. Close it.
Shake it and put it in the glass.

151
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,469
Jeez.

152
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:22,224
- Who took your order?
- Tay did, but she's ignoring me today.

153
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:24,476
- But who's making mistakes?
- They are!

154
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:25,644
No!

155
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:28,647
- I've already said it, I've just said it.
- Me too!

156
00:11:28,647 --> 00:11:30,857
- Tell them...
- I even...

157
00:11:30,857 --> 00:11:33,860
- Girl, I've already asked.
- Tell them...

158
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,946
Then come here, not there!

159
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:39,366
- Here, three beers.
- Tay...

160
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:40,742
Let me explain.

161
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:44,830
- You serve them.
- But come here. So?

162
00:11:44,996 --> 00:11:47,999
What are you gonna do
if somebody goes there?

163
00:11:48,125 --> 00:11:51,002
- You tell to look for them!
- Okay.

164
00:11:51,002 --> 00:11:56,925
- They're serving the lounge.
- One gin and tonic and one gin with juice.

165
00:11:57,634 --> 00:12:00,220
There are too many people
in here, Ricardo!

166
00:12:01,805 --> 00:12:03,348
Serve right!

167
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:09,020
I don't remember who ordered three beers.
I'm waiting here for a long time.

168
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:29,332
Not you. For God's sake.

169
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,126
How's work going?

170
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:35,881
- Three gins and tonic for us, please!
- I want five sex on the beach!

171
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:45,056
- Let's drink.
- Dude.

172
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,394
- Look at that girl.
- The one wearing yellow.

173
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,354
Dude!

174
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:54,691
Thanks!

175
00:12:54,691 --> 00:12:58,195
I'm mad at you, Murilo.

176
00:12:58,195 --> 00:13:02,365
Why is that, man? Hey, what did they
tell you about me?

177
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,535
You're gonna make her cry...

178
00:13:05,535 --> 00:13:08,663
- Yes.
- Look at me.

179
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:12,584
Are we pals?

180
00:13:12,584 --> 00:13:15,003
We are. But wanna talk later?

181
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,297
No...

182
00:13:18,507 --> 00:13:24,513
I didn't go to that house
to get in people's way, okay?

183
00:13:24,638 --> 00:13:28,475
No! Never ever. That's why
we really have to talk. No problem.

184
00:13:28,475 --> 00:13:29,893
That's it. That's cool!

185
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:35,774
Bro, we got here together,
we don't know anything

186
00:13:36,024 --> 00:13:40,445
and we've already had a history.
Bro, sorry if we ever argued...

187
00:13:40,695 --> 00:13:43,740
No. Guys, living together is hard.

188
00:13:43,865 --> 00:13:47,452
Look, that's most important, bro.

189
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:53,500
We have to promise one thing.
Never go to sleep mad at each other.

190
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:59,548
- Booze drifts apart, food brings together.
- I said, "I'll stop eating." Remember?

191
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:03,176
"I argued with Murilo, I won't eat."

192
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:08,265
No way!

193
00:14:09,015 --> 00:14:11,059
- I am...
- I'm cool. I am passionate too.

194
00:14:12,811 --> 00:14:15,313
- To us!
- To us, fuck!

195
00:14:21,278 --> 00:14:23,905
The problem is, is Ramon good or bad?

196
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:26,408
Really? That's the name of my father.

197
00:14:26,575 --> 00:14:28,702
But the drunk Ramon is good.

198
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:33,206
Is it really the name of your father?
What's yours?

199
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:36,001
- It's Vanessa.
- Nice to meet you.

200
00:14:36,001 --> 00:14:40,380
- Every Ramon is a good person.
- Yeah, my father is a good person.

201
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:43,842
I was thinking about doing
something bad now.

202
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:46,803
- Not to me, right?
- I didn't say anything.

203
00:14:47,971 --> 00:14:51,808
Take this any way you want, Vanessa, okay?

204
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:38,897
Fuck, Ramon hooks up with somebody
everywhere he goes. Look.

205
00:15:39,022 --> 00:15:41,941
He's a womanizer.

206
00:15:43,109 --> 00:15:45,236
- Are you gonna stay here romancing?
- Who?

207
00:15:45,236 --> 00:15:47,864
- The whole party?
- I'm gonna stay with you now.

208
00:15:48,114 --> 00:15:51,493
I told him,
"Are you gonna stay here romancing?"

209
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:53,703
No, but even I would be here.

210
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:00,335
What's up?

211
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:02,671
- That's okay.
- What?

212
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:08,968
- We're tired.
- You worked, but you'd better improve...

213
00:16:09,135 --> 00:16:11,429
One for all, and all for one!

214
00:16:11,429 --> 00:16:15,433
- Here's the reward, you can have fun!
- Amen! Thanks!

215
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:22,941
Amen!

216
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,693
Where's the booze?

217
00:16:25,151 --> 00:16:27,070
We saved for you guys, kid.

218
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,657
One for all, all for one!

219
00:16:31,032 --> 00:16:34,160
One for all, all for one!

220
00:16:36,663 --> 00:16:37,789
Fuck!

221
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:40,375
Hey, Murilão!

222
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:43,461
Murilão, come here!

223
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:48,299
Hey, I'm gonna talk to Ricardão.
I'm gonna try to borrow the boat for us.

224
00:16:51,344 --> 00:16:54,180
Like, I don't know when,
but at least one ride.

225
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:58,059
- Hey, do you want me to talk to him?
- No, just chill,

226
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,895
- I can do this.
- Just us?

227
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:03,398
Breathe. Easy, darling.

228
00:17:13,867 --> 00:17:15,326
Hey, bro!

229
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,248
How are you?

230
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,209
How was it?

231
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:28,840
- Did the girls do well?
- It was a little hard at the beginning...

232
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:33,553
- It's crowded, because it's summer.
- Good.

233
00:17:33,678 --> 00:17:36,931
- I wanted to ask you a favor.
- Shoot, that's why I'm here.

234
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:41,728
- Last vacation... Do you remember?
- I clearly remember everything you did.

235
00:17:41,728 --> 00:17:44,230
I don't know if that's good or bad.

236
00:17:44,689 --> 00:17:49,819
But I committed myself when I called you.
I picked up the phone to call you.

237
00:17:50,028 --> 00:17:52,864
It was that one time I needed a boat

238
00:17:52,864 --> 00:17:58,912
to enjoy one night with the boys
and girls, I'm not sure you remember this.

239
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:00,705
Yes, I do.

240
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:06,753
The girls, although they weren't great,
but I believe in them incredibly.

241
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:10,298
- If I commit to you...
- No.

242
00:18:11,174 --> 00:18:15,220
- Why not?
- It's early, you barely started working,

243
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,807
- the girls didn't do so well...
- But what's missing?

244
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:21,810
Call this guy, tell him
I asked you to talk to him.

245
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:25,647
He can help. That's the best
I can do for you right now.

246
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:28,900
And I mention your name when I call him?

247
00:18:29,025 --> 00:18:30,735
He'll help you, say my name.

248
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:34,322
- Thanks. I guess!
- Maybe the boat is not that big.

249
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,449
I'm gonna pray.

250
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:49,838
- She's a prick, man.
- That's what I've just told her.

251
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:58,763
Don't let her make you lose your mind.
Don't lose it in front of her.

252
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:03,184
No. She knows it.

253
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:07,772
- She's my friend, I know, but dive in.
- She knows I'm weak, but then...

254
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:10,942
I respect her as always... Fuck it.

255
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:15,989
I didn't have sex for three months.

256
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:18,992
- She knows I like her.
- Jeez, she knows it.

257
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,077
She knows I like her, bro.

258
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:26,624
I don't do this to her.
I've never done this to anybody.

259
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:30,378
- I'm being very honest with you guys.
- Now you're doing this to her.

260
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:35,800
Bro, come on, you know?
Putting up with this shit? Fuck you.

261
00:19:35,925 --> 00:19:38,052
Man...

262
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:40,555
Tay is not sure about her feelings.

263
00:19:40,555 --> 00:19:45,226
She's free, she does
whatever she wants with her life.

264
00:19:45,393 --> 00:19:51,232
- I wanna talk later, right?
- I was very honest with her.

265
00:19:51,232 --> 00:19:55,820
- Bro, look at season one, how it went.
- Stop crying, she's coming. Stop crying.

266
00:19:55,945 --> 00:20:00,033
I'm not gonna stop it.
Because this is what I'm feeling...

267
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:03,620
- Come on!
- That's what I'm feeling, you know?

268
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:07,957
But there's no need
for this joy, you know...

269
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:12,045
It's about being honest and being cool
when you're having fun. Fuck it.

270
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,505
That's it. That's okay.

271
00:20:16,424 --> 00:20:19,177
Let's go home!

272
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:24,223
- Bye, girls!
- Kisses!

273
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:30,563
Hit pause.

274
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,231
You know what's fucked up?

275
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:37,362
I love it, you know. He was expecting
Tay to make a scene about that sex event.

276
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:41,449
He's bothered by the situation,
like, she doesn't care about me.

277
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:45,161
But I didn't get that part
about her being not sure.

278
00:20:45,161 --> 00:20:47,789
- I think that's on him!
- She's totally sure.

279
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:51,376
- I didn't get why he was crying.
- I didn't! At all!

280
00:20:51,376 --> 00:20:56,005
He's annoyed because
Tay didn't do anything.

281
00:20:56,005 --> 00:21:01,386
He doesn't get he's the one playing games,
he's getting a taste of his own medicine.

282
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:05,181
- I like Murilo a lot...
- I like him when he's sober.

283
00:21:05,181 --> 00:21:08,267
I think he's being noble,
he's already apologized to Anna,

284
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:09,936
he admitted he was crying.

285
00:21:10,103 --> 00:21:12,563
He's expressing his feelings, that's cool.

286
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,859
- But, dude, he had to do that to Tay.
- I didn't get it when he said "prick"...

287
00:21:16,859 --> 00:21:22,323
- But he had to do that to Tay.
- Maybe he doesn't want to open up to her.

288
00:21:22,490 --> 00:21:26,661
- No, Tay is smiling, look.
- He's blaming Tay!

289
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:31,791
- No! He's crying because he likes her.
- And Tay is playing games with him?

290
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:37,296
I don't think he's playing games,
I think he's sorry.

291
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:43,136
I think he's crying because
when we use our temple...

292
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:47,098
- Tears of arousal.
- ...our body in a wrong way, we suffer.

293
00:21:47,432 --> 00:21:51,894
- Now she's a minister!
- Oh, Carol!

294
00:21:52,103 --> 00:21:53,855
Go preach away from here.

295
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:57,608
Do you think he's crying
because he's sorry or...

296
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:01,946
Yes, I've been there. I liked a person...

297
00:22:02,113 --> 00:22:07,910
and had sex with another. The thing ended,
and I was disgusted with myself, you know?

298
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:11,414
- This is called moral hangover.
- I spent all night crying.

299
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:17,045
- I think he's feeling this way.
- Do you think he's disgusted with himself?

300
00:22:17,170 --> 00:22:20,757
- Yes.
- No, guys! He's blaming Tay!

301
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:26,471
I think he's crazy about her
and doesn't know how to approach her...

302
00:22:26,637 --> 00:22:32,602
He's crying because he's sorry or because
he's seeing she doesn't want him anymore.

303
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:35,229
He's seeing... That's it.

304
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:39,901
I think, maybe he's afraid
she doesn't want him anymore, you know?

305
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:43,780
By the way she's acting. Maybe I missed
something, I think he's like that.

306
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:46,324
I think he likes her so much

307
00:22:46,491 --> 00:22:52,121
that when he sees her kissing somebody,
it's the same as seeing her having sex.

308
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:58,044
But if he had seen her having sex
on their bed, he'd have freaked out.

309
00:22:58,169 --> 00:23:03,883
I think he got involved in the game,
he got involved, he went overboard a lot

310
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:06,344
and is very sorry.

311
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:11,641
Tell me now, who's playing games?
Tay or him?

312
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:16,562
If she likes him,
like she said in the car...

313
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:20,024
But she said it's over, girl.

314
00:23:20,024 --> 00:23:24,862
- She's doing what she said she'd do.
- Why did she hook up with the guy?

315
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:30,034
- Girl! For God's sake!
- Look, guys...

316
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:33,871
She doesn't like that guy, she hooked up
with that guy to tease him, guys.

317
00:23:33,871 --> 00:23:38,543
And he hooked up with that girl
to tease her. That's obvious.

318
00:23:38,668 --> 00:23:41,754
You can love one person,
but feel attracted to others.

319
00:23:41,754 --> 00:23:46,592
Girl, you know when somebody
is determined to forget a person?

320
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:50,513
- She can fall back for him.
- Obviously, but in a relationship,

321
00:23:50,513 --> 00:23:53,432
the point is finding somebody
worth waiting for.

322
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:55,685
- I won't wait.
- If you have somebody...

323
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,937
I won't wait, I'm a whore.

324
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:11,284
Go, Vanessinha, go.

325
00:24:14,245 --> 00:24:16,539
Vanessinha, welcome.

326
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:18,875
- Thanks, baby.
- Home sweet home.

Rendeiras Av. ZIP 88062-400

328
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:25,798
What?

329
00:24:27,258 --> 00:24:30,136
- Let's talk?
- I don't get it.

330
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:32,597
Girl, what a drama, man.

331
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:36,851
- Stop thinking you're right.
- There's no right or wrong.

332
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:42,190
- There are two free people...
- That's right.

333
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:46,360
- ...who do whatever they want, got it?
- But what I told you in the van,

334
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:49,906
I'll say it again.
You made a scene about his actions.

335
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:53,451
- Girl, look, really...
- Oh, you'll say he's not in love?

336
00:24:53,659 --> 00:24:58,581
If he was, he wouldn't fuck someone else
in the bed he shares with me.

337
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:03,211
He should have had sex in the sex room!
I don't have to see them having sex!

338
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:06,172
- He's sorry. He's very sorry.
- I saw it!

339
00:25:06,464 --> 00:25:10,968
- They had sex, I was alone in the bedroom.
- Don't you think I saw that and left?

340
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:16,307
Okay, girl, you saw it. You saw it, but...

341
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:22,355
- He should have had sex here in the pool!
- You should put yourself in his shoes.

342
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:26,525
- I told you I wouldn't do it.
- I know, girl, but you're saying

343
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:29,904
- you wouldn't do it...
- Why are we talking about this?

344
00:25:29,904 --> 00:25:35,910
Suddenly he wakes up today
and is in love with me.

345
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:40,873
It's easy to fuck some girl, take her
to our bed and feel sorry the day after.

346
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:43,501
"Wow, I'm very sorry", got it?

347
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:48,172
Girl, imagine what it's like, the boy
is in love with you, and you tell him...

348
00:25:48,172 --> 00:25:51,175
- In love with me, my ass.
- He had the chance

349
00:25:51,175 --> 00:25:55,972
- to ignore you, and he didn't.
- Girl, you have to embrace these feelings.

350
00:25:55,972 --> 00:26:00,935
- I'm talking about the last vacation too.
- But we committed to each other.

351
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:06,774
- How do you think this is a lie?
- It was different when we got out of here.

352
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:20,538
Even at the table. Oh, my God.

353
00:26:20,746 --> 00:26:22,248
It's family, right, man.

354
00:26:22,707 --> 00:26:24,125
There's or... no.

355
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:31,299
It's great. I don't wanna say this,
but it's delicious.

356
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:33,092
What's missing, man?

357
00:26:33,718 --> 00:26:35,803
Is there ice?

358
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:40,683
There isn't?

359
00:26:40,683 --> 00:26:43,352
Tay is very stubborn, bro.

360
00:26:43,352 --> 00:26:48,649
- Tay is very stubborn, bro.
- Because of our age, I'm 28.

361
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:52,570
She's 23. She has
to fully enjoy her life, she's right.

362
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,612
I'll send your regards to everybody.

363
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:37,156
I think they're all upstairs.

364
00:27:51,253 --> 00:27:52,963
Let's see what he has to say.

365
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,097
- Hello.
- Daniel?

366
00:28:01,806 --> 00:28:06,477
- Yes, that's right.
- I work with Ricardo at the beach.

367
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:09,021
- How are you?
- I'm fine, everything is great.

368
00:28:09,438 --> 00:28:14,485
I'm calling for a special reason.
Yesterday, I talked to Ricardo

369
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:21,492
and asked him if he could lend me the boat
we used in our last vacation here.

370
00:28:21,784 --> 00:28:25,037
Actually, he told me you'd call.

371
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:28,833
That's okay,
I'll negotiate the price with him,

372
00:28:28,833 --> 00:28:33,087
- but this is happening.
- Deal!

373
00:28:33,671 --> 00:28:36,215
You're the man!

374
00:28:36,215 --> 00:28:37,800
Dude!

375
00:28:46,892 --> 00:28:50,896
Hey, guys! The van is here. Let's go?

376
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:12,918
Let's go!

377
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:27,349
- Let's drink this champagne?
- Yeah!

378
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:30,561
- Fuck!
- Let's drink it!

379
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:34,940
To the best vacation in the world!

380
00:29:39,195 --> 00:29:41,113
Fuck!

381
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:12,645
Look at this, there's nothing.
Totally unspoiled.

382
00:30:30,371 --> 00:30:34,166
- No boy coming home?
- I have a handsome friend.

383
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,001
Renan.

384
00:30:38,504 --> 00:30:41,632
- He's coming at night.
- Carioca, right?

385
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:44,677
- Inked.
- So, I'd like one

386
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:46,387
in the house.

387
00:30:56,438 --> 00:30:57,690
Look where Luan is!

388
00:30:58,566 --> 00:31:00,401
- Where?
- He's gone!

389
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:04,780
- He must have had Beatriz suck his dick.
- For sure.

390
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:09,535
- That's for sure!
- They must be having sex now.

391
00:31:24,049 --> 00:31:25,593
Let's go home?

392
00:31:25,593 --> 00:31:27,136
Let's go.

393
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:29,722
I see a gorgeous man, stretched.

394
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:00,628
Thanks, bro.

395
00:32:06,383 --> 00:32:08,010
Jeez! I'm back.

396
00:32:13,474 --> 00:32:15,434
I'm gonna put it right here.

397
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,992
- What are you gonna do today?
- So...

398
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,954
Bro, I guess everybody is exhausted.

399
00:32:36,497 --> 00:32:38,666
What do you think about

400
00:32:38,666 --> 00:32:41,126
having a barbecue here?

401
00:32:41,126 --> 00:32:43,128
- Jeez.
- I swear to you.

402
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:46,882
It's the best thing.
Better than going out. Listen up, bro.

403
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:49,593
- Is there gonna be cheese?
- Hear me out...

404
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:53,263
We can invite other people.

405
00:32:53,430 --> 00:32:57,226
We can invite other people.
Don't do it if you don't want to.

406
00:32:57,726 --> 00:33:00,104
Do you know who you'll invite?

407
00:33:00,104 --> 00:33:02,022
I'm gonna invite Vanessa.

408
00:33:02,314 --> 00:33:04,108
There's Vanessa, the DJ...

409
00:33:06,276 --> 00:33:08,320
I'm gonna invite Beatriz.

410
00:33:08,529 --> 00:33:11,907
Man, if Ramon brings
all his connections, there's gonna be

411
00:33:12,074 --> 00:33:15,828
- about 30 chicks.
- And he's gonna kiss all of them.

412
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,705
That's a lie.

413
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:20,708
- I'm gonna hook up with Nath tonight.
- No!

414
00:33:20,708 --> 00:33:24,545
See? I was going to. I tried.
Now I'm gonna invite somebody.

415
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:27,464
- I don't want to, I don't feel like it.
- See.

416
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:29,591
Let me drink some more.

417
00:33:40,811 --> 00:33:43,230
Is the barbecue here?

418
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:48,485
Damn, our guests!

419
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:53,907
Hey! Kid!

420
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,410
Now we're talking!

421
00:33:56,744 --> 00:33:58,996
Nice to meet you, Anna.

422
00:33:58,996 --> 00:34:02,708
Fucking rain.

423
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:07,838
What's up, bro? Are you good?

424
00:34:08,172 --> 00:34:09,631
Are you cool?

425
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:15,345
Look who's here!

426
00:34:15,721 --> 00:34:18,098
Look who's here!

427
00:34:19,183 --> 00:34:22,728
- You left without seeing your friend.
- Where were you?

428
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:25,355
How I missed you!

429
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:30,944
- I'm fine, what about you?
- Cooking.

430
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:32,946
Damn!

431
00:34:32,946 --> 00:34:33,989
Hi.

432
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:38,160
No hard feelings.

433
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:41,997
- I still love you.
- You are the only one I liked.

434
00:34:44,416 --> 00:34:47,252
- Girl, go for it.
- I'm a woman too, you know?

435
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:50,672
- Girl, go for it.
- I don't want any problem...

436
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,508
Never!

437
00:34:52,508 --> 00:34:57,554
She asked if Ramon and I have something
going on. I told her to go for it.

438
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:00,224
- No more.
- I told her.

439
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:04,019
No. Didn't I say, "The only one
Ramon hooked up with I liked"?

440
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:07,898
My name is Nathália
and I don't hook up with the same guy

441
00:35:08,065 --> 00:35:11,360
I'm gonna hook up with all guys
And Anna will follow along

442
00:35:12,528 --> 00:35:14,780
Nath!

443
00:35:15,364 --> 00:35:17,991
Come here, Nathália.

444
00:35:17,991 --> 00:35:20,869
On the chair!

445
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:29,211
Don't get dirty.
It's too dirty. Go, Nathália.

446
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:32,047
- Come on, Nathália!
- I've already put it.

447
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:41,014
Sit down!

448
00:35:41,223 --> 00:35:43,976
Come on!

449
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:51,108
You know...

450
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:01,618
Open your mouth.
Now make him lose his mind with the shot.

451
00:36:01,618 --> 00:36:03,829
I'm not good at this.

452
00:36:03,996 --> 00:36:08,041
Did you swallow? He does that by himself.

453
00:36:11,461 --> 00:36:13,171
Not yet?

454
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,466
Is it gonna be me all the time?

455
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:18,594
Not yet?

456
00:36:18,594 --> 00:36:20,387
Is it gonna be me all the time?

457
00:36:20,387 --> 00:36:22,222
- Tonight or forever?
- Forever!

458
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:25,183
- Easy, let's talk about tonight.
- Not about tonight.

459
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:29,021
- Is it gonna be me all the time?
- You had sex with a girl. Easy.

460
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:30,480
I heard her moaning.

461
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:33,901
- Easy, I'm still hurt because of that.
- Wait. What about me?

462
00:36:33,901 --> 00:36:37,446
- Kissing is no big deal.
- That's it.

463
00:36:37,738 --> 00:36:41,658
If you go to the bedroom
and see some guy making me cum...

464
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:48,665
You had sex. It's gonna take some time
until I want to kiss you.

465
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:51,209
- Shut up. Please. Quiet.
- Let me tell...

466
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:54,171
Just listen to me.

467
00:36:54,171 --> 00:36:58,175
- Just listen to me.
- Okay.

468
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:01,219
We hadn't seen each other
for three months.

469
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:04,556
- Two months!
- Almost three.

470
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,059
We hadn't seen or spoken to each other.

471
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:12,272
Then I get here, we get along just fine,
we have a real nice moment...

472
00:37:12,272 --> 00:37:16,735
If it were any other girl
that I had hooked up with and said, "Man,

473
00:37:16,735 --> 00:37:19,404
"let's be promiscuous?" I'd say, "Yes."

474
00:37:19,404 --> 00:37:23,283
- I didn't say that.
- But we have a history, you know?

475
00:37:23,408 --> 00:37:26,161
- Don't put words in my mouth.
- We have a history.

476
00:37:26,286 --> 00:37:30,624
But why am I gonna hook up with a chick
if I'm gonna be with her the other day?

477
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:36,254
Three days later, I'll feel like
hooking up with another one.

478
00:37:36,421 --> 00:37:38,924
Then we shouldn't be together.

479
00:37:39,216 --> 00:37:42,427
Tay, our time is gone, okay?

480
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:46,181
- Our time is gone.
- Let's stop it, get in there and have fun.

481
00:37:46,181 --> 00:37:48,642
- Our time is gone.
- Some conversation!

482
00:37:48,642 --> 00:37:52,270
- Oh, no. I have to smoke here.
- Bro, you weren't supposed to be here.

483
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,314
Hey, stop being rude!

484
00:37:54,564 --> 00:37:58,193
- Come here, Lô, leave him!
- He wasn't rude to me.

485
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:00,862
He wasn't rude to me.

486
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:07,160
I'm gonna throw Luan.

487
00:38:07,536 --> 00:38:10,706
Hey, Luan, don't let me
mess things up again.

488
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:14,710
Bro, gag me, tie me, please, right now.

489
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:18,505
Man, tie me, please, tie me.
Gag me, please. Knock me out.

490
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:24,052
- Gag me, please. Knock me out.
- I'm gonna do it soon, you're gonna sleep.

491
00:38:24,386 --> 00:38:26,972
- Please.
- What?

492
00:38:26,972 --> 00:38:30,142
What?

493
00:38:30,392 --> 00:38:33,061
Who?

494
00:38:33,061 --> 00:38:37,733
Here. On you, right now, fuck!
Get fucking real!

495
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:40,610
What's this?

496
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:47,951
I want it too.

497
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:53,081
- His dick was bumping into your knee.
- He said Murilo bumped his...

498
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:58,670
Get fucking real! I was watching!
I was waiting. Get the fucking leg off!

499
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,922
Do you think I was feeling his dick?

500
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:06,136
- Are you... Oh, fuck you!
- Stop it, Luan!

501
00:39:06,136 --> 00:39:08,472
What... Right?

502
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:13,143
- I wasn't feeling anything.
- No problem, Beatriz!

503
00:39:13,477 --> 00:39:15,020
Stop it!

504
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:18,482
- This is bullshit!
- Do whatever you want, man.

505
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:24,696
No, I understand, but I don't...
No, really, I didn't even care!

506
00:39:24,696 --> 00:39:29,659
- You play a saint all the time.
- Murilo was bumping his dick into my knee.

507
00:39:29,659 --> 00:39:31,995
Girl, I didn't even notice.

508
00:39:34,206 --> 00:39:39,878
Man, we drank a lot.
I'm drunk too, I'm not sober.

509
00:39:39,878 --> 00:39:45,092
He's gonna bump his dick
into my knee, I'm feeling his dick!

510
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,803
- Fuck, into my knee!
- No. You're not feeling it.

511
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:52,682
- You're not normal, you're a saint!
- Stop it, Luan!

512
00:39:52,933 --> 00:39:54,309
Stop it, Luan!

513
00:39:55,018 --> 00:39:57,771
- Just pretend.
- It's no use pretending.

514
00:39:57,896 --> 00:39:59,856
Do you need other dicks?

515
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:02,400
- Oh! For God's sake!
- Do you miss a dick?

516
00:40:05,821 --> 00:40:06,905
What?

517
00:40:07,197 --> 00:40:12,119
He went there to say, "Didn't you notice
the guy bumping his dick into your knee."

518
00:40:12,244 --> 00:40:16,081
- In this case, Murilo.
- And why did he argue with her?

519
00:40:16,206 --> 00:40:18,875
But that's because Murilo

520
00:40:18,875 --> 00:40:22,504
- and Luan have this beef.
- But, buddy, you don't have to...

521
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:26,967
Did you see how he talked to her?
Why didn't he go...

522
00:40:26,967 --> 00:40:30,345
The guy was bumping his dick
into her knee, but that's it, bro!

523
00:40:30,554 --> 00:40:33,807
- Say, "Get your dick off my chick?"
- Exactly!

524
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:38,145
He wanted to play the tough guy
with her. What an ass...

525
00:40:38,353 --> 00:40:40,272
He didn't go talk to the guy!

526
00:40:40,272 --> 00:40:45,694
But that was obvious last summer's end.
When they had that fight, things got ugly.

527
00:40:45,819 --> 00:40:51,408
He did nothing. When somebody
confronts him, he chickens out.

528
00:40:51,658 --> 00:40:52,993
Which was Murilo.

529
00:40:52,993 --> 00:40:56,955
Which was Murilo, the one he's accusing
of bumping the dick into her knee.

530
00:40:57,289 --> 00:41:03,044
I would go talk to him and say,
"What's up? You're disrespecting my woman.

531
00:41:03,295 --> 00:41:08,300
"Are you bumping your dick into her knee?
What's up, bro? Are you crazy?"

532
00:41:08,466 --> 00:41:14,431
There was a similar situation
last summer. Murilo didn't like

533
00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:18,018
what Luan did to Bia in the bus,
there was that fight.

534
00:41:18,018 --> 00:41:23,190
When Anna argued with Murilo,
whom did she go talk to?

535
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:27,068
To Luan, who was supporting Anna
about Murilo's opinion.

536
00:41:27,068 --> 00:41:31,781
So, they have this history,
but that doesn't justify what he did.

537
00:41:31,781 --> 00:41:37,204
Regardless of what Murilo did,
if it was on purpose or not,

538
00:41:37,204 --> 00:41:39,581
Luan's attitude was completely wrong.

539
00:41:39,748 --> 00:41:44,252
He should have talked to Murilo.
He should have gone to talk to him.

540
00:41:44,377 --> 00:41:50,300
Why did he have to argue with her?
She was doing absolutely nothing.

541
00:41:50,592 --> 00:41:55,931
He didn't talk loud to her, he whispered
in her ear so Murilo didn't hear.

542
00:41:56,056 --> 00:41:59,976
When Murilo was far away,
he started to scream at her...

543
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:04,689
If she wanted to talk and tell her friends
what was going on, she didn't know because

544
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:10,403
- she's lost and there's booze involved...
- Poor girl, she was completely lost.

545
00:42:10,570 --> 00:42:14,282
I think his attitude is outrageous,
I think it's ridiculous.

546
00:42:14,407 --> 00:42:17,619
Her friends must support her,

547
00:42:17,619 --> 00:42:21,581
she must stand up for herself.

548
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:27,712
Regarding Tay and Murilo, he said
stupid things. Men got lost in that party.

549
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:33,301
They had the chance to get along,
to express themselves, they fucked it up.

550
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:38,306
I think Luan and Murilo
made a huge mistake.

551
00:42:38,765 --> 00:42:42,310
Tay gave him a chance...

552
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:47,023
Tay gave him a chance, and he screwed...

553
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:51,695
He wasn't rational, he didn't get
she was letting him be free,

554
00:42:51,695 --> 00:42:54,406
and he wasted it all, you know?

555
00:42:54,406 --> 00:42:58,451
What I think about Murilo and Tay
is that they didn't have that breaking up

556
00:42:58,618 --> 00:43:03,290
- every relationship needs...
- Sit down and talk.

557
00:43:03,290 --> 00:43:04,332
They'll have it.

558
00:43:05,333 --> 00:43:10,046
Like the breaking up Nath and Ramon had.

559
00:43:10,046 --> 00:43:11,464
They don't have problems.

560
00:43:11,464 --> 00:43:17,095
They don't have any problems. They need
that kind of breaking up to be cool.

561
00:43:17,095 --> 00:43:23,059
In the past, they didn't get along well
because they always had a fight.

562
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:26,730
Now, Murilo always respected Tay a lot,
you know? So, this is mutual.

563
00:43:26,896 --> 00:43:32,110
We're on episode two,
we still have a long way to go.

564
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:35,405
Let's see what's going to happen
on next, go.

565
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:41,077
ON THE NEXT EPISODE

566
00:44:00,138 --> 00:44:01,973
Oh, my God!

567
00:44:03,183 --> 00:44:05,477
- Oh, my God!
- Fuck!

568
00:44:05,894 --> 00:44:08,480
- The guys fought, bro?
- Again? No!

569
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:10,565
Oh, my God!

570
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:15,445
- One guy went to hold the other...
- It's Murilo and Luan.

571
00:44:15,445 --> 00:44:18,406
But you saw them leaving
with that angry look, right?

572
00:44:18,698 --> 00:44:22,160
They had a disagreement at the party
and took it home.

573
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:24,371
Oh, my God!

574
00:44:24,496 --> 00:44:27,165
Do you think they fought
or they're helping someone?

575
00:44:27,457 --> 00:44:30,960
- No, it has already happened...
- No, the way Luan threw...

576
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:33,963
- Were they really fighting?
- I don't know...

577
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:37,217
There may be something there,
I don't know, maybe...

578
00:44:37,384 --> 00:44:39,928
They had a disagreement in the bus!

579
00:44:40,136 --> 00:44:45,475
Something happened at the party,
and in the house, Bia was crying.

580
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:47,936
Bia was crying in the house, man.

581
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:52,774
There was a disagreement at the party,
in the bus, and in the house.

582
00:44:53,066 --> 00:44:56,611
I wonder if Luan and Murilo's fight
happened now. Like...

583
00:44:56,611 --> 00:45:00,240
- That's for sure, girl!
- But I think they have a grudge

584
00:45:00,448 --> 00:45:05,495
that started last summer. I love drama.
Relationships must have this drama.

585
00:45:05,662 --> 00:45:08,456
- It's no good without drama.
- No!

586
00:45:08,456 --> 00:45:11,376
If none of them cries,
what is it good for?

587
00:45:11,376 --> 00:45:17,132
I just have to say, the next episode
will be, like, something out of control.

588
00:45:17,132 --> 00:45:20,927
- Exactly!
- Girl, call the cab for us?

589
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:25,098
Girl, I'm gonna call it from my cell,
but I'm taking the glass.

590
00:45:25,098 --> 00:45:26,641
Just don't call the bus.

591
00:45:26,641 --> 00:45:29,561
There's only fighting in buses, guys.

592
00:45:29,686 --> 00:45:32,397
- For God's sake.
- Come, cousin.

593
00:45:32,564 --> 00:45:36,234
Carol, bring the popcorn, kid!

594
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:40,113
Guys, what a mess!
