1
00:00:07,717 --> 00:00:09,301
Guys, did anybody fall?

2
00:00:09,301 --> 00:00:11,387
WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS 2
THE REVIEW

3
00:00:11,387 --> 00:00:14,932
We got here falling
and knocking down everything.

4
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:18,644
- What's up, guys?
- Buddy, long time no see!

5
00:00:18,644 --> 00:00:22,481
- Hi, guys! I missed you!
- Is everything all right, guys?

6
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:25,151
What's up, guys? Are you cool?

7
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:30,656
Jeez. John broke the set,
that's great.

8
00:00:30,906 --> 00:00:33,576
Lexa, turn around, show off that look.

9
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:35,035
Girls' look.

10
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:37,830
Jeez!

11
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:42,543
Man, it's crazy how we always match!
Golden shades, really beautiful.

12
00:00:42,543 --> 00:00:44,503
And Titto, right?

13
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,798
What's up, guys?

14
00:00:49,759 --> 00:00:51,177
How are you?

15
00:00:51,761 --> 00:00:54,722
- Oh, fabulous!
- Very happy!

16
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:57,850
Guys, today things are gonna get wild!

17
00:00:58,392 --> 00:01:01,103
- Today it's gonna be a mess!
- As usual.

18
00:01:01,103 --> 00:01:03,647
Like every day, always. That's normal.

19
00:01:03,647 --> 00:01:07,485
Yes. Today we'll see
what we've been waiting for to happen.

20
00:01:07,485 --> 00:01:12,865
I want a new party, a new story,
a new intrigue, another couple.

21
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:16,660
Bia did more things in one night
than in the whole vacation.

22
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:19,747
She looks like she's free, right?

23
00:01:19,955 --> 00:01:22,124
I don't judge because I'd do the same.

24
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:25,085
No, you wouldn't, you'd do worse.

25
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:28,631
No, I imagined she'd hook up
with just one guy,

26
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:32,009
but she kissed two guys
in just one night. Guys, yummy!

27
00:01:32,009 --> 00:01:37,807
She just hooked up with the other guy
because the guys created those situations.

28
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,850
I don't think so, because

29
00:01:40,017 --> 00:01:44,522
she hooked up with a guy,
then she hit on that guy, you saw?

30
00:01:44,522 --> 00:01:48,067
No, but I give her a round of applause!
She hit on that guy...

31
00:01:48,275 --> 00:01:52,571
She's beautiful, single, free,
independent, why not?

32
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:55,616
I loved it!

33
00:01:55,783 --> 00:02:01,121
No, I'm gonna call her Bandit Bia.
She's acting more like a thug than I am.

34
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:05,167
- Girl, I'm like her.
- I don't have the guts to do that.

35
00:02:05,376 --> 00:02:08,379
No, don't say that, Carol.

36
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:10,673
- At this time, man?
- Carol!

37
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:14,385
- Look the guy in the eye and say
- You don't look, you say,

38
00:02:14,385 --> 00:02:18,806
"I wanna tell you something."
Then, "Hey, give me your number."

39
00:02:19,473 --> 00:02:23,978
I think now my nickname is gonna be Bia,
because I'm like her.

40
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:27,523
I saw it, I want it, I can do it.

41
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:30,734
It was nice because she broke free.
She needed that.

42
00:02:30,734 --> 00:02:32,862
She broke free.

43
00:02:32,862 --> 00:02:36,740
- She built her confidence.
-"She broke free."

44
00:02:37,575 --> 00:02:42,288
She needed to get rid of Luan's energy.
Goodbye, Luan, move on.

45
00:02:42,288 --> 00:02:44,957
Guys, what about that young guy?
Renatinho?

46
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:47,918
He had sex with Anna the first day.

47
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:51,797
He got there doing
what he had to do, right?

48
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,299
He was too eager.

49
00:02:54,133 --> 00:02:55,843
Absolutely.

50
00:02:55,968 --> 00:03:00,097
What's that, "He did it on the first day."
How long do you take?

51
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:03,976
- No, I'm a "right now" person!
- A look, a smile, and then sex.

52
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:07,605
If I see a guy, and I like him,
we do it the same day.

53
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:12,776
You never know
if there'll be a second chance.

54
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:16,864
This is how I see it. If I don't
do it now, when will it be?

55
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:18,949
I do it, honey.

56
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:24,038
I act quickly, you know?
But I have to improve the way

57
00:03:24,038 --> 00:03:25,581
I approach the guy.

58
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:30,294
Last episode, we ended
on that misunderstanding

59
00:03:30,294 --> 00:03:32,796
- between Murilo and Tay.
-"I wanna leave!"

60
00:03:32,796 --> 00:03:35,799
If I were Tay,
I wouldn't go talk to Murilo.

61
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:39,720
- I'd wait for him.
- There are four episodes left.

62
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,183
I think they're gonna fight
and have sex a lot.

63
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:46,644
Are you ready? My chocolate milk is.

64
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:49,271
Should we hit play?

65
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,357
Hit it, hit it hard.

66
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,864
You can cry.

67
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:02,618
I don't need to tell you
to shut up, you know?

68
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:07,122
I'll never say, "Nath, shut up", you know?

69
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:09,750
Oh, Murilo, shut up

70
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,670
Oh, that's because you
wanna play the saint.

71
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:15,464
I wanna play the saint?

72
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,478
What bothered me the most was

73
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:35,734
that everything happened
in front of me, you know?

74
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:41,240
You were throwing yourself at Nathália
the whole time, helping her...

75
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:44,284
Obviously, that bothered me.

76
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:49,540
He just did that because he saw
Anna hooking up with another guy.

77
00:04:49,707 --> 00:04:53,585
I don't know if he planned that,
but that's a bad thing to do.

78
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:59,675
I think so because he said...
Nath was next to Anna.

79
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:02,094
He was immature in that respect.

80
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:06,974
Imagine, you're with a guy
and he's hitting on your friend!

81
00:05:07,349 --> 00:05:13,313
- Imagine their bad breath as they talk...
- It's something I never got.

82
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,483
Soap operas, I've worked on nine of them.

83
00:05:16,483 --> 00:05:22,031
Who wakes up and kisses somebody
in the mouth?

84
00:05:22,239 --> 00:05:26,035
When I wake up,
it's like I licked a dog's ass.

85
00:05:26,035 --> 00:05:27,202
Jeez.

86
00:05:27,202 --> 00:05:32,332
You wake up with someone and say,
"Jeez, did you eat a corpse, man?"

87
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:37,629
Wait, what kind of bad breath
does this person have?

88
00:05:37,796 --> 00:05:41,925
I'm not saying I wake up
with no bad breath, but I brush my teeth

89
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:45,220
when I wake up
and before going to bed too.

90
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,765
You brush your teeth before going to bed,

91
00:05:47,765 --> 00:05:51,852
you stay there with your mouth shut.
You wake up with bad breath.

92
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:55,064
I don't have that bad breath.
My mouth is...

93
00:05:55,064 --> 00:06:00,319
Guys, my mouth is very clean,
but I'm picky about smell.

94
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:06,241
Buddy, sometimes,
morning sex is the best ever.

95
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:09,661
But you don't have to kiss on the mouth.

96
00:06:09,787 --> 00:06:14,166
Morning sex is the best sex ever.
You're not ready for this conversation.

97
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:19,046
Morning sex really makes a lot of sense,
it's really good. But no kissing.

98
00:06:19,046 --> 00:06:22,424
But then, Titto, like, you...

99
00:06:22,424 --> 00:06:26,428
Let's assume you're single.

100
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:30,349
Then you hooked up with a chick
and went to the bedroom,

101
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:33,894
you had sex and woke up in the morning,

102
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:37,147
she's on top of you, trying to kiss you...

103
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:41,068
I'm gonna share with you one move
I've never shared in public.

104
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,320
We want to know if it's your dick.

105
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,533
- I'm kidding!
- The best move is...

106
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:53,747
I won't advertise the brand, but you take
some chewing gum, chew it. Leave it there,

107
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,666
in the corner of the mouth.

108
00:06:55,833 --> 00:07:00,212
The pieces stay in the filling,
that's disgusting, Titto!

109
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:02,297
Here, in the corner of your mouth.

110
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:06,885
You sleep with the gum, the problem is
if the gum sticks on the chick's hair.

111
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:08,720
You sleep and wake up,

112
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:11,014
in the morning, you shake it and...

113
00:07:11,014 --> 00:07:12,808
Oh, that's disgusting! No.

114
00:07:13,725 --> 00:07:17,146
Titto, do you see why
I don't like kissing?

115
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:23,318
Guys, I love kissing at a party,
those great kisses.

116
00:07:23,318 --> 00:07:27,406
I don't feel like kissing
in the morning like I do at parties.

117
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:31,243
- If I'm involved, I kiss the guy.
- You don't brush your teeth?

118
00:07:31,368 --> 00:07:35,789
Jeez, guys, you stick your mouth
in worse places.

119
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:37,624
Exactly.

120
00:07:37,624 --> 00:07:40,502
I just peck in the morning.

121
00:07:40,669 --> 00:07:44,548
- No kissing on the mouth.
- Me too.

122
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:46,008
Cramp in the tongue.

123
00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:47,259
In the morning...

124
00:07:48,343 --> 00:07:52,931
No, they were just talking,
and we talked a lot here. Honestly.

125
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:57,936
I wonder if they're gonna be friends
or if they're gonna hook up.

126
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:02,649
What Titto said, they're working
things out... They're talking.

127
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,611
I think he'll say,
"Hey, I'm sorry for everything.

128
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:09,323
-"Let's move on."
- I think she's gonna test him.

129
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:14,453
She's not gonna hook up with him right now
and she's gonna watch his behavior...

130
00:08:15,996 --> 00:08:20,083
It seemed, yesterday, he was here
for Nathália. And I was like...

131
00:08:22,878 --> 00:08:28,217
She said, "Since I want to
hook up with Murilo, let's hook up.

132
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:32,054
"Since Renato wants to hook up with Anna."

133
00:08:32,054 --> 00:08:37,059
I said that to Anna, "Let's hook up..."

134
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:40,270
- Who said that?
- Tay.

135
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,149
That's what happened.
I didn't get it.

136
00:08:47,027 --> 00:08:48,070
You're whining.

137
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:52,241
You're a drunk, clueless.

138
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:54,493
Clueless!

139
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:56,578
She's getting pissed very easily.

140
00:08:56,745 --> 00:09:02,125
- You were very jealous. You see things.
- Jealous of what?

141
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:05,087
- Do me a favor? Go talk to a shrink.
- I'm never...

142
00:09:05,087 --> 00:09:08,924
- I've had two abusive relationships...
- You need help too.

143
00:09:08,924 --> 00:09:10,259
I don't need a third...

144
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:12,761
- Abusive? When was I abusive?
- You weren't?

145
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:14,221
No, dude!

146
00:09:14,221 --> 00:09:17,391
Murilo, you were the only one
who heard that.

147
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:19,142
- I was the only one?
- Yes.

148
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:22,813
She had to explain
what she's talking about.

149
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:26,358
No, seriously.
If I were Tay and I'm right,

150
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:29,069
I don't have to explain anything,
he's wrong.

151
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:32,114
But you are there, in front of each other.

152
00:09:32,114 --> 00:09:34,616
- He's wrong.
- If you seek peace, you explain.

153
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:39,204
She's wrong because she didn't explain.

154
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:42,749
But I think she didn't understand
that he misunderstood.

155
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:46,503
She should have explained
why she said that.

156
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:50,799
- At this point he won't listen.
- I think she didn't get it.

157
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:56,513
She's saying this, "You misunderstood."
But she's not saying what it is.

158
00:09:56,513 --> 00:10:02,561
I think... I love Murilo,
but I think he's totally wrong.

159
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,439
I agree!

160
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:08,191
It was his mistake, he misunderstood that.

161
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,986
Yeah, he totally misunderstood what...

162
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:14,740
But I think he didn't get that yet, guys.

163
00:10:14,906 --> 00:10:17,284
- She didn't explain.
- Ramon got there...

164
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:20,412
there's always that friend
who makes things worse.

165
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:23,290
Oh, guys. I wish they worked things out.

166
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:27,294
You know what's fucked up, guys?
This. Gossiping.

167
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:32,758
If you gather everyone involved and say,
"Let's discuss all this!"

168
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:37,137
Yes, nobody talks,
then you go to the bathroom...

169
00:10:37,262 --> 00:10:41,224
Then Carol tells me,
"Oh, Titto said you're a..."

170
00:10:41,224 --> 00:10:43,393
If we gather and talk, it's over.

171
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,939
That's the thing about Murilo
and Tay's relationship,

172
00:10:47,939 --> 00:10:52,110
- why does he listen to Ramon?
- Everybody was drunk and saw it.

173
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:55,697
It's like that worthless
Chinese Telephone game, you know?

174
00:10:55,697 --> 00:11:00,994
But I think that, if he were
less defensive, she'd be too.

175
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:03,288
I agree.

176
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,415
Let's pretend

177
00:11:05,415 --> 00:11:07,167
- we've never met.
- Thank you.

178
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:09,044
Oh, no, guys!

179
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:11,922
You see? That's what you get with pride.

180
00:11:11,922 --> 00:11:15,258
That's fucked up
because she likes him a lot.

181
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:18,970
He likes her a lot... I also think,

182
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:24,059
the tone of a conversation is not the way
you talk, but the way you listen.

183
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,812
The interpretation changes everything.

184
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:31,650
Maybe he said something,
she understood differently!

185
00:11:34,277 --> 00:11:36,321
- Go for it.
- Mind the step.

186
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:42,119
Renatinho had a slight disappointment.
His friend made him work!

187
00:11:42,494 --> 00:11:44,329
He had to work too.

188
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:48,250
I'm from Rio.
I'm here on vacation. Doing...

189
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:50,460
"I'm from Rio, dude."

190
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,838
That old saying, "I'm from Rio, dude."

191
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:54,840
That accent is a killer.

192
00:11:56,049 --> 00:12:00,637
Why are cariocas like that?
They boss around. The...

193
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:03,140
I love the carioca accent!

194
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,975
- I'm from Rio, dude!
- Are you?

195
00:12:04,975 --> 00:12:07,978
- No, I'm from Bahia.
- Are you from Bahia?

196
00:12:07,978 --> 00:12:10,772
Bahia. Hello, Canavieiras, Una.

197
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:14,192
Stop, that's enough advertising!

198
00:12:14,401 --> 00:12:17,404
What's the deal with those chicks?

199
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:20,365
If the manager doesn't see...

200
00:12:20,365 --> 00:12:24,828
Murilo said he can hit on whoever
he wants, but the manager can't see it.

201
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:29,499
He's just like me when I used to work.
"Don't let the manager see this."

202
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:32,335
Did you do that?

203
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:34,379
Imagine what Pabllo did

204
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:38,675
to keep a low profile at work,
being this tall. How do you do it?

205
00:12:38,675 --> 00:12:43,472
When I used to work in telemarketing,
we spoke to the bitches on the phone...

206
00:12:43,472 --> 00:12:48,602
- Did you hit on them while telemarketing?
- I just answered calls. I'm passive.

207
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:49,936
How did you answer?

208
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:53,273
I answered, no!

209
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:57,694
We were just connected,
we only pressed the button. Well...

210
00:12:57,694 --> 00:13:00,197
Wait, I have a complaint. I'm calling.

211
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:03,033
- Hello?
- Good morning, Customer Service?

212
00:13:03,325 --> 00:13:06,578
I want to complain about my coffee
on this show.

213
00:13:06,578 --> 00:13:09,581
Is your coffee an espresso,
a latte or just black?

214
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:14,461
- Black, please.
- I'll connect you management, press five.

215
00:13:14,461 --> 00:13:19,549
Let me tell you. What a beautiful voice,
do you only work there?

216
00:13:19,549 --> 00:13:23,136
I just work here,
you know how it is, right?

217
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,263
I'm shocked!

218
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:28,725
The call is to talk about coffee
and ends up giving you milk,

219
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:33,563
I'm sorry, bad joke, but what happened,
Pabllo? Is that how you talked to people?

220
00:13:33,563 --> 00:13:39,569
Obviously. Guys, I indulged my fantasy
of being at telemarketer.

221
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:44,908
The guy hangs up the phone with a boner.

222
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:50,956
I had to say my name, Pabllo,
I had to say the company name,

223
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,166
a credit card company.

224
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:57,837
Like this, "Good morning, Amazon Prime.
Pabllo. How can I help you?"

225
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:02,175
What was the most unusual thing
that happened in one of those calls?

226
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:06,846
A man wanted to know my address
to send me a gift.

227
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:08,181
And did he send it?

228
00:14:08,348 --> 00:14:13,937
- I never got anything!
- But have you ever got somebody's number?

229
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,523
I couldn't because we...

230
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:20,902
They recorded the calls. I've been caught
a lot of times talking bullshit.

231
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:23,363
I'm not sorry!

232
00:14:24,072 --> 00:14:29,411
Was there, like, a call about a complaint
and you had phone sex, like this?

233
00:14:29,411 --> 00:14:32,831
You can't because there's
a lot of things, right? So...

234
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:36,876
A booth? Did you talk sexy
like this? Like you did?

235
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:40,046
I always talk like this, that's my tone.

236
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,257
- No, like...
- Always!

237
00:14:42,924 --> 00:14:47,137
- I'm shocked.
- I'd love to be answered by you.

238
00:14:47,137 --> 00:14:51,057
Yeah, you can't complain.
You call pissed...

239
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:55,812
Like people from Minas Gerais. They say,
"Go fuck yourself," you just go, "I go."

240
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:59,691
I swear to God, people from Minas Gerais
have a soft accent.

241
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:03,987
But the accent from Rio
is like a porn movie accent, right?

242
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:07,616
Oh, girl. The accent from Rio
and from the Northeast.

243
00:15:08,867 --> 00:15:10,785
Just me. I'm new here, just me.

244
00:15:11,745 --> 00:15:14,789
Ramon is approaching like that, look.

245
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:21,046
- His approach. Look at his face!
- Ramon really is from Niterói, man.

246
00:15:21,171 --> 00:15:24,090
Ramon doesn't even keep
a low profile, bro.

247
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:27,010
Did you see his look? He did this.

248
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:31,222
It's like John when he gets here
and looks at me. Right, John?

249
00:15:31,431 --> 00:15:33,642
Ramon's hooking up with everybody.

250
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:37,479
He's keeping a high profile!
He's drawing a lot of attention.

251
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:40,065
The three of them
want that girl very much.

252
00:15:40,065 --> 00:15:42,317
Now, Murilo, I wonder if he...

253
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:47,781
- Oh, fuck!
- Where do I know you from?

254
00:15:49,074 --> 00:15:51,951
Oh, bullshit! What a bad pick-up line.

255
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:55,038
"From some beach."

256
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:02,045
Yeah. In Praia da Daniela.

257
00:16:03,254 --> 00:16:05,632
Yeah. In Praia da Daniela.

258
00:16:05,632 --> 00:16:07,842
He pulled a fast one on his friend!

259
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:11,262
No, man. He met her at that first party.

260
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:14,391
He was trying to hook up with her
and wasn't able to.

261
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:17,686
He was stalling her and didn't...

262
00:16:17,686 --> 00:16:20,980
Guys, what a hot girl, help!

263
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:23,942
Man, what a bad pick-up line!

264
00:16:24,109 --> 00:16:27,070
No, he's really met her!

265
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:28,321
- Really?
- Yeah.

266
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:32,450
You realized he pulled
a fast one on his friend, right?

267
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:37,664
Oh, in the land of the eyes,
the blind man is king.

268
00:16:37,872 --> 00:16:40,208
Are you okay, buddy?

269
00:16:40,333 --> 00:16:42,836
Constant dripping wears away a stone!

270
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,797
Girl, all good? How are you?
Let me tell you.

271
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:47,424
I've just got here...

272
00:16:47,424 --> 00:16:50,135
I told you, bitch!

273
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:52,053
A pussy was needed.

274
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:56,141
She's that friend she called yesterday.
She's coming to Floripa.

275
00:16:57,892 --> 00:17:01,730
Oh, she's that friend who said,
"I'm coming tomorrow", right?

276
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,899
I said that's my dream,
doing that someday.

277
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:09,028
That call that Lexa wants
to make for a moment.

278
00:17:09,028 --> 00:17:10,947
I wanted to make for a moment.

279
00:17:18,246 --> 00:17:20,582
I'm gonna be careful with what I say now.

280
00:17:20,582 --> 00:17:22,709
Renato selected...

281
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:24,627
That's it!

282
00:17:24,627 --> 00:17:27,130
Oh, man!

283
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:29,758
The selection here is...

284
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,719
- You're done, baby.
- That's right!

285
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:34,512
It's possible to hook up.

286
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:40,560
- Don't do this, no.
- I'll take it.

287
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,312
No, you take it, not me.

288
00:17:42,312 --> 00:17:45,106
- You'll take it.
- No!

289
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:47,400
I don't want it, bro.

290
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:49,569
- Ramonzinho.
- I don't want it.

291
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:53,198
But he's right too.
He doesn't fall for anybody.

292
00:17:53,364 --> 00:17:55,116
Take it, let's take it.

293
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:59,704
- Did you see the size of my belly?
- I'll talk to you later.

294
00:18:00,413 --> 00:18:02,749
- What?
- Where did you go?

295
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,209
That's all I needed.

296
00:18:04,209 --> 00:18:05,668
No, hit pause.

297
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:11,049
I think he got into trouble by himself,
like John said before.

298
00:18:11,049 --> 00:18:16,513
I think he got into trouble by himself
when he put his hand on his head.

299
00:18:16,513 --> 00:18:18,014
When somebody does that,

300
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:22,977
- it's because they fucked up.
- He's already taking the blame, right?

301
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:28,858
He took the girl home, but didn't want it,
Murilo made him do that, he was forced.

302
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:34,072
Then he took her. And he went
to explain the situation to the chick...

303
00:18:34,072 --> 00:18:37,617
I think he made a mistake in the morning,

304
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:42,914
at the bad breath moment,
when he expressed his feelings...

305
00:18:42,914 --> 00:18:44,541
Then he...

306
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:49,379
Then he took the opportunity to hook up
with a girl and thought no one would know.

307
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:52,882
No problem with hooking up
with that girl over there.

308
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:57,262
But the boys took those chicks
to the house, and he had to deal with it.

309
00:18:57,262 --> 00:19:03,101
I think that if he wanted
to avoid that situation,

310
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:08,773
he could've been honest with the chick
he took home, saying he had a girl...

311
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:12,360
- in the house and...
- But, Jerry... They apologized and...

312
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:16,030
..."I'm not gonna hook up with you,
but you can come."

313
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:18,074
That was his mistake.

314
00:19:18,074 --> 00:19:21,703
I can't take those boys, guys.
Looks like...

315
00:19:21,703 --> 00:19:26,791
They're all the same. They don't talk,
they just do it, they hook up and...

316
00:19:27,667 --> 00:19:33,423
But, Carol, the way Anna reacted,
do you think she's fine or she's hurt?

317
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:35,633
She's hurt and...

318
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:40,305
we go back to that topic you were talking,
"Oh, if it were some outsider,

319
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:43,516
"Anna wouldn't get upset." She would.

320
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,059
Outsider or not.

321
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:48,271
Guys, I think Anna's not upset because...

322
00:19:48,271 --> 00:19:52,525
I think she doesn't even know
Renatinho hooked up with somebody.

323
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:57,113
Oh, she was the first to notice when she
got in the house. She did this, look.

324
00:19:57,113 --> 00:19:59,115
But I think she got upset because

325
00:19:59,115 --> 00:20:04,203
Murilo and Tay had fought earlier, so,
there shouldn't be so many girls there.

326
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:06,998
It's about respect in the house.

327
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:09,959
Yeah, I agree with John too.

328
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,587
Pabllo said it.

329
00:20:12,587 --> 00:20:18,176
Murilo did that because he wants
to watch it all burn down.

330
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:23,097
You know that kind of person that's like
your dog, at home, when it makes a mess?

331
00:20:23,097 --> 00:20:26,309
That's Renatinho, man!

332
00:20:26,434 --> 00:20:29,187
I think he's overreacting, you know?

333
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:33,024
Renatinho is raising
the "I fucked up" sign. He really is.

334
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:36,736
All I wanted was she hooked up
with that guy, you know?

335
00:20:36,736 --> 00:20:40,114
But are you cool, dude?

336
00:20:40,114 --> 00:20:42,617
Are you okay?

337
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:46,621
Do you fall for that bullshit
Renatinho is saying?

338
00:20:46,788 --> 00:20:49,123
"I'm here to be free" and he's in pain?

339
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:52,085
He's already in pain, guys, come on!

340
00:20:52,085 --> 00:20:53,711
He's deceiving himself.

341
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:58,549
- He's deceiving himself.
- His ego's hurt.

342
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:02,178
Anna... I think Anna didn't fall for him.

343
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:07,809
She got upset with that situation,
that's different.

344
00:21:07,809 --> 00:21:12,397
She said, "Doesn't he just want
to have sex? So, I'll have sex at home."

345
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,525
Remember that thing I told you?

346
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:18,820
"Bro, don't fall for this", you know?

347
00:21:18,945 --> 00:21:22,240
Don't fall in love, don't get emotional...

348
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:25,660
"Don't get emotional." That's it.

349
00:21:26,077 --> 00:21:29,205
Miss Emotional got crazy.

350
00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:31,666
Miss Emotional.

351
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:36,337
It's like me,
giving advice I don't follow.

352
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:40,341
- It's me telling everything I do.
- Wait, did you see? Murilo,

353
00:21:40,508 --> 00:21:45,805
"Don't get emotional, don't fall in love."
Just a little take of Tay with other guys.

354
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,682
You can imagine what's coming.

355
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:53,396
I have friends who arrive at a party,
kiss and leave.

356
00:21:53,563 --> 00:21:56,733
- But I'd rather that conversation...
- What do you mean?

357
00:21:56,733 --> 00:22:00,361
Guys, look. I'm gonna be honest.
That depends on the time.

358
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:04,949
- Right? Doesn't it depend on the time?
- People talking.

359
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:07,452
I think talking is a phony thing.

360
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:09,662
Girl, it depends on the time.

361
00:22:09,662 --> 00:22:15,126
Man... I lost track of men I had sex with
and I don't even know their names.

362
00:22:15,293 --> 00:22:17,003
What do you mean, a phony thing?

363
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:20,673
I think it's all phony. People ask,
"Where are you from?"

364
00:22:20,673 --> 00:22:22,675
They won't remember anything!

365
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:26,262
The person's not interested,
only wants to have sex.

366
00:22:26,262 --> 00:22:31,517
Night-outs have a schedule.
At the beginning, you're patient...

367
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:37,440
I see the guy walking, crossing the place
and kissing, like, 4:00 in the morning?

368
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,568
My friends don't even ask
names, places, times.

369
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:43,988
I like to talk. But, for example,
I've met you at a party,

370
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:47,241
"Let's set a date
for us to go out and talk?"

371
00:22:47,241 --> 00:22:49,952
Oh, come on! Finally, hypocrisy. No.

372
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:53,289
You go get laid?

373
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:57,210
No, it's not about getting laid,
I wanna kiss, dance...

374
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,920
I wanna...

375
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:02,215
But where are you gonna talk?

376
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,760
Pabllo, you're at a party.
Lexa, not now, but...

377
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,763
Everybody's at a party, everybody's free.

378
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:13,726
Hypothetically speaking, you're at a party
and a hot guy comes, a hot chick comes.

379
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:18,272
- Then you hook up, 4:00 in the morning.
- Let's play this out?

380
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:19,565
But I'm the woman.

381
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:21,734
Why are you the woman?

382
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:24,821
You can't get too close, here, look.

383
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:26,614
1:00 in the morning.

384
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:28,491
I'm the DJ.

385
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:30,701
Guys, we're playing this out!

386
00:23:30,701 --> 00:23:33,913
Go, then I'm the MC, go.

387
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,374
Midnight.

388
00:23:36,374 --> 00:23:38,709
What's up, babe? How are you?

389
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:41,045
Are you from around here?

390
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:43,464
- Yes. What's your name?
- Fernando.

391
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:44,715
Nice to meet you.

392
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:48,136
- Are you free today, at this party?
- With friends.

393
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:51,013
- But are you free for me?
- You're fast!

394
00:23:51,013 --> 00:23:52,849
Get over here, come here.

395
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:56,102
- Midnight.
- Midnight. You do all this?

396
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:57,645
I don't play hard to get.

397
00:23:57,645 --> 00:23:59,897
3:00 in the morning.

398
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:01,858
Well, are you free?

399
00:24:01,858 --> 00:24:03,860
I'm fine, what about you?

400
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:05,528
- Let's do it?
- Yes!

401
00:24:05,528 --> 00:24:06,612
At 5:00!

402
00:24:06,612 --> 00:24:08,281
Just here, look.

403
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:12,076
- Like this?
- That's it!

404
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:16,080
We've just played that out. Thanks, DJ.

405
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:19,083
Thanks MC Carol from Niterói, that's it.

406
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:24,213
Cheers, fuck!

407
00:24:24,338 --> 00:24:28,384
It's rad. It's just not centered,
but it's good.

408
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:30,928
Renatinho is kissing... is it Anna?

409
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:33,472
It's another one, Renatinho...

410
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,141
Oh, guys, that's it.

411
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,602
That's it, he's a player. Look at Anna.

412
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:39,979
That one is a thug, he fell in love.

413
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:42,231
Anna, no!

414
00:24:42,356 --> 00:24:43,524
Anna!

415
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,693
She was joking, right?

416
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:46,861
She's joking!

417
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:50,156
She's joking,
but she wants to mark her territory.

418
00:24:50,156 --> 00:24:53,075
- Let's beat her up!
- My love, look...

419
00:24:53,201 --> 00:24:56,078
Guys, I'm like Anna 101 percent.

420
00:24:56,746 --> 00:25:01,792
- I'm like Nath on that vacation.
- I'm Anna.

421
00:25:03,085 --> 00:25:05,171
Good vibes, kissing everybody...

422
00:25:05,171 --> 00:25:08,049
Bro, Renatinho is hitting
on another woman.

423
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:09,634
Look at Renatinho.

424
00:25:12,303 --> 00:25:14,805
But Renatinho gets prettier every minute.

425
00:25:14,805 --> 00:25:18,517
Renatinho is womanizing,
he's very loose. Look.

426
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:21,812
Hit pause!

427
00:25:21,812 --> 00:25:23,731
Pause, Carol.

428
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:27,276
When you were free, were you
like that? You got to the place,

429
00:25:27,443 --> 00:25:32,657
you didn't wait for people to get
in the mood, you didn't notice anything...

430
00:25:32,782 --> 00:25:37,620
- Were you like that?
- Who? Me? No.

431
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:40,998
I gotta tell you,
I was married all my life, man.

432
00:25:40,998 --> 00:25:44,126
I was a father when I was 16...

433
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:47,922
But you had to have
some history to be a father.

434
00:25:49,257 --> 00:25:50,925
Answer, Titto.

435
00:25:50,925 --> 00:25:54,178
I wasn't ugly, I was poor, man.

436
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:57,348
Titto's puberty was sad.

437
00:25:58,015 --> 00:26:01,269
We are the ones
who are gonna explore the whole house.

438
00:26:01,269 --> 00:26:02,520
Are you crazy?

439
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,817
Fuck, Renatinho is crazy, man.

440
00:26:08,317 --> 00:26:12,238
Renatinho is like Carol
from Wild and Free: Florianópolis.

441
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,158
Now he's gonna be wrong
if he doesn't fulfill that. Got it?

442
00:26:16,158 --> 00:26:21,330
She even pretended
she was crying, did you see?

443
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,749
Renatinho is really wasted.

444
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:25,293
Really wasted.

445
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:30,673
Everybody's at the same pace,
he's much faster.

446
00:26:30,965 --> 00:26:32,508
Dude!

447
00:26:32,675 --> 00:26:35,344
And Anna got closer to take a look again.

448
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:37,596
He said, "He looks like me."

449
00:26:39,307 --> 00:26:40,599
Jeez.

450
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:45,938
Renatinho became Renatão.

451
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:53,070
- Triple kiss!
- What's that?

452
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:57,074
Bro, she's upset!

453
00:26:57,199 --> 00:27:00,036
Renatinho became Renatão.

454
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:02,955
He's the one who's hooking up the most!

455
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,666
But, bro, go, let's see.

456
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:26,771
I sent her the sex...

457
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:32,651
Is it Anna?

458
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:36,489
- It's Anna. The dogs. What's that, guys?
- I'm shocked!

459
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:40,117
She nails it, you see? She does her thing.

460
00:27:40,117 --> 00:27:43,662
Honey, Beyoncé is like this, shocked.

461
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:51,504
But I couldn't feel anything
seeing Murilo hooking up with others.

462
00:27:52,797 --> 00:27:54,340
The love's over, guys?

463
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:56,467
I don't like him anymore. You know?

464
00:27:56,467 --> 00:28:01,597
She whispered, "I couldn't feel anything.
I think I don't like him anymore."

465
00:28:01,597 --> 00:28:05,142
This is good, because she's letting
that feeling go away.

466
00:28:05,142 --> 00:28:08,521
"I think", to me,
is something very... I don't know.

467
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:11,565
She's not sure, right?
She's in that in-between.

468
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:16,529
Everything Murilo did in this episode,
taking those girls home,

469
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:20,032
he did to affect Tay.

470
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:23,411
If that's not working anymore,
if Tay doesn't care anymore,

471
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:25,246
Murilo is gonna suffer a lot.

472
00:28:25,246 --> 00:28:27,164
She doesn't mean that, right?

473
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:33,212
She's incredibly beautiful,
she can hook up with anyone she wants.

474
00:28:33,379 --> 00:28:37,591
But she decided to stay cool
and he went wild.

475
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:43,264
She said, "I'm in mourning,
when this is over, things will get ugly."

476
00:28:43,264 --> 00:28:48,144
Maybe she didn't hook up with anybody
so she has a reason to nail it in the end.

477
00:28:48,144 --> 00:28:53,190
"Baby, do you remember the summer
when you hooked up with everybody?"

478
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:56,694
Hit play, so we see
what's gonna happen, go.

479
00:28:57,278 --> 00:28:58,821
This could be pregnancy?

480
00:28:58,821 --> 00:29:00,656
ON THE NEXT EPISODE

481
00:29:02,366 --> 00:29:04,410
Fuck, bro!

482
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:09,415
- Oh my God, no, no!
- I had some very exciting sex, brother.

483
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:14,962
- The guy was very crazy!
- They're nitpicking, right, man?

484
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:18,549
I've never seen this
in any other reality show.
