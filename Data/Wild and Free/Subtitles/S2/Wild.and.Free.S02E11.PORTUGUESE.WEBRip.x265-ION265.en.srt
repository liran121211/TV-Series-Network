1
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:06,882
- Jerry's anxious!
- Wait!

2
00:00:07,133 --> 00:00:09,677
Everybody was dancing back there...

3
00:00:09,844 --> 00:00:12,346
Let's do it...

4
00:00:13,097 --> 00:00:14,098
I'll just clap.

5
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:16,434
What will happen?

6
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:18,352
MC is missing...

7
00:00:18,769 --> 00:00:21,188
Is missing... yeah!

8
00:00:23,816 --> 00:00:26,902
Hi, how are you? Is everybody fine?
How was the week?

9
00:00:27,111 --> 00:00:28,988
- It was great!
- It was okay.

10
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:32,199
Everybody's anxious to see
what's going on today?

11
00:00:32,867 --> 00:00:35,077
I wanna see it. That pregnancy...

12
00:00:35,077 --> 00:00:37,079
I forgot about that, man!

13
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,457
There's that possible pregnancy.

14
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:41,709
Remember that Renatinho arrived...

15
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:43,210
kissed everybody,

16
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:46,547
hooked up with Anna.
Will they be a couple?

17
00:00:46,547 --> 00:00:49,675
They won't be a couple,
but they'll make out a lot.

18
00:00:49,675 --> 00:00:53,763
Anna was the last one I saw him kissing.

19
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:59,810
Anna and Renatinho learned that
they're free, so they're free as a couple.

20
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:01,353
They ended up having sex.

21
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:03,564
Was that it? Oh, that's true!

22
00:01:03,564 --> 00:01:04,607
He kissed a lot

23
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:06,692
and ended up with Anna.

24
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:07,902
Yes, it's true.

25
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:11,447
What about Murilo and Tay?
What do you think?

26
00:01:11,655 --> 00:01:13,824
Do you think it's really over?

27
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:17,119
Do you think Murilo's gonna play games?

28
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,915
I wonder if Tay's gonna play games.
What do you think?

29
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,502
I told you they learned
they have to be friends because

30
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:28,214
when they see each other
making out with somebody else...

31
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:29,632
Yeah...

32
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:31,133
She said she's detached.

33
00:01:31,133 --> 00:01:33,886
- They can't do that.
- She's free now.

34
00:01:33,886 --> 00:01:37,681
Guys, since the first half
of the vacation,

35
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:41,310
there have been a lot of fights,

36
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,396
and now I think they need to be friends.

37
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:47,775
They don't work well close, nor far away.

38
00:01:47,775 --> 00:01:52,071
In my opinion, that couple,
especially Tay, can't take it anymore.

39
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:53,531
She can't.

40
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:55,241
Murilo will try something.

41
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:56,909
- She's really tired.
- Yes.

42
00:01:57,284 --> 00:01:58,661
- Are you ready?
- Let's go!

43
00:01:59,078 --> 00:02:00,746
- Are you ready?
- Yes!

44
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:01,789
Let's go!

45
00:02:01,789 --> 00:02:03,749
Are you ready?

46
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:05,501
I have the remote today!

47
00:02:05,751 --> 00:02:07,461
Delicious!

48
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,129
Come, Christian Grey!

49
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,631
Let's go!

50
00:02:39,785 --> 00:02:41,996
WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS 2

51
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,209
They had bread and beer.

52
00:02:47,334 --> 00:02:48,878
Hey, Mu, look.

53
00:02:49,044 --> 00:02:52,089
I was thinking about
getting the car, going downtown,

54
00:02:52,381 --> 00:02:54,425
and go for a ride on the lagoon.

55
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:55,926
Thank God. Let's go.

56
00:02:56,093 --> 00:03:00,014
I was thinking about
going with Renato, Anna, and Murilo.

57
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,349
Do you agree? We'll see what we can...

58
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:03,976
Jesus, awesome, buddy!

59
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:08,647
If there's a stand up paddle board
put in the car...

60
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:20,993
Bea?

61
00:03:22,536 --> 00:03:24,580
- Are you okay?
- I feel sick.

62
00:03:24,747 --> 00:03:27,458
Bea, let's go for a drive.
Just me and you.

63
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:30,794
- Jeez.
- Can you do it?

64
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:33,881
Get out of the house just a little.

65
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:37,134
I can.

66
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:44,934
- Bye, guys! We'll be right back.
- Bye.

67
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,977
- Bye. Drive safe.
- Thanks.

68
00:03:50,397 --> 00:03:51,899
It's a beautiful day.

69
00:03:55,486 --> 00:03:57,237
I don't like your queasiness.

70
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,323
I don't understand it either.

71
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:01,533
- That's not normal.
- No.

72
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:10,584
Do you think you could be pregnant?

73
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:13,504
No.

74
00:04:16,715 --> 00:04:18,509
Oh, my God, now I'm worried.

75
00:04:18,634 --> 00:04:20,469
I don't like these queasiness.

76
00:04:21,011 --> 00:04:25,015
You're feeling sick every day,
not because of medicine, booze or food.

77
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,103
I don't know.

78
00:04:29,103 --> 00:04:31,230
I think this could be the booze.

79
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,148
You feel sick when you drink?

80
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:37,277
- No.
- So, it's the first time this happened.

81
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:42,700
You know, we should stop
by a drugstore and settle this.

82
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:48,914
At least, if you're not pregnant,
you should see a doctor.

83
00:04:50,833 --> 00:04:53,252
Oh, girl, that's terrible. No.

84
00:04:54,086 --> 00:04:55,796
We should stop by a drugstore.

85
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,215
- We could.
- Just to be sure.

86
00:05:22,614 --> 00:05:24,033
I smell bread.

87
00:05:24,283 --> 00:05:26,410
Oh, let's check our weight.

88
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,412
- Oh, where is it?
- Here.

89
00:05:29,121 --> 00:05:30,330
Good afternoon. Hi.

90
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,541
I'd like a pregnancy test, please.

91
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,387
Are you nervous?

92
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:48,348
I'm starting to be. Actually, now I am.

93
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,642
When you buy the test, you get...

94
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,853
I didn't come to...

95
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:55,397
- To think about it.
- Yes.

96
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:59,443
We just said that,
"Could it be?" You said, "No."

97
00:05:59,777 --> 00:06:01,945
At least we end this doubt.

98
00:06:02,154 --> 00:06:04,615
Think about it, girl. What am I gonna do?

99
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:39,942
Damn.

100
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,573
- Hey, Bia, Tay!
- What?

101
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,826
We're leaving, we'll be right back.

102
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:51,703
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

103
00:06:52,996 --> 00:06:54,498
I'll take the front seat!

104
00:06:55,207 --> 00:06:56,750
- No way!
- Damn!

105
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,183
Bullshit, dude.

106
00:07:14,309 --> 00:07:16,645
- I don't see a board.
- It must be inside.

107
00:07:16,937 --> 00:07:19,022
- Guys...
- Let's take a look!

108
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:20,774
I told you!

109
00:07:20,774 --> 00:07:22,609
Look at his cousin!

110
00:07:22,609 --> 00:07:23,861
Let's talk to him.

111
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:26,572
- Look at his cousin!
- That's not possible!

112
00:07:26,822 --> 00:07:29,158
You're fucking with me.

113
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:31,243
You're fucking with me.

114
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:33,912
Are you okay? Nice to meet you, I'm Ramon.

115
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,874
- Welcome.
- Take it easy.

116
00:07:37,082 --> 00:07:41,712
Let me ask you something.
Don't you have a SUP board?

117
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,464
You made us come here,

118
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:47,050
we came all the way to Jurerê

119
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,845
- to buy...
- Which huge floaty do you have?

120
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:51,847
- We had arranged...
- A flamingo.

121
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,850
A flamingo! Oh, not the flamingo.

122
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:00,856
Fuck, it's the flamingo!

123
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,192
Oh, damn, dude!

124
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,776
Fuck!

125
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:07,362
- Guys!
- Fuck!

126
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:10,365
You were complaining,
look at this huge flamingo.

127
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:13,577
Dude, this is the mother of all flamingos.

128
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:16,955
Just don't destroy our flamingo.

129
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:18,373
I wanna stay here.

130
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:19,958
How will we take this?

131
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,793
Let's put this up there.

132
00:08:21,793 --> 00:08:24,254
Everybody, help us put it there...

133
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,923
on the top of the car!

134
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:27,382
Damn, we're fucked!

135
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:29,885
Let's go! I need your help!

136
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:35,140
CAUTION
DANGEROUS CROSSROADS IN 200 METERS

137
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:44,650
Look back, see if there's a crowd
waiting for us.

138
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,778
There's a one-kilometer line back there.

139
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,698
Let's take the flamingo!

140
00:08:52,032 --> 00:08:54,409
Bro, let's take the flamingo!

141
00:08:54,660 --> 00:08:56,411
Let's go! Hey!

142
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:59,122
Let's go!

143
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,001
Say goodbye!

144
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:07,881
Let's go!

145
00:09:13,845 --> 00:09:15,347
It's simple saying "no".

146
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:17,391
Right? Forget the stress.

147
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,059
Asshole.

148
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:27,067
- Damn!
- Stop it!

149
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:32,155
I wanna throw it on the wall.

150
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,202
It's nothing. It's wrong.

151
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,371
Leave it there.

152
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:41,915
It'll be ready soon.

153
00:09:42,249 --> 00:09:44,126
I'm anxious, I can't leave here.

154
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:45,335
Yeah, so...

155
00:09:45,961 --> 00:09:48,338
-"Not pregnant."
-"Not pregnant."

156
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,133
- Phew, amen!
- Amen!

157
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:53,593
Oh, my God, I knew it!

158
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:05,105
Look who's here, a new member!

159
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,481
One picture.

160
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:08,442
Go Renato.

161
00:10:08,775 --> 00:10:11,445
Fuck, this thing is huge, man!
I'm shocked.

162
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:15,407
Let's go to the water.

163
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,562
Go, I'll put my foot.

164
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,943
Oh, shit.

165
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,430
- I have to talk to Anna.
- About?

166
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:26,103
Things, bro. We used to talk about

167
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:30,315
being together in the house,
and when we got out...

168
00:11:30,482 --> 00:11:31,566
- Having fun.
- Yes.

169
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:34,277
We would hook up with whoever we wanted.

170
00:11:34,778 --> 00:11:38,240
But on second thought,
I think that's fucked up.

171
00:11:38,448 --> 00:11:40,909
I don't even know what I want, you know?

172
00:11:41,034 --> 00:11:43,537
I'm enjoying being with her here.

173
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:48,625
Although, sometimes,
there are some things that...

174
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,378
- Like?
- She wants to...

175
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,424
do things in her own time, you know?

176
00:11:55,424 --> 00:11:57,342
She does things in her own time.

177
00:11:57,509 --> 00:11:59,261
Yeah, in her own time.

178
00:11:59,678 --> 00:12:02,055
She does that...

179
00:12:02,764 --> 00:12:05,767
So I'll stop hooking up with other chicks.

180
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,687
But it doesn't work this way.

181
00:12:08,854 --> 00:12:10,689
We came here to have fun!

182
00:12:10,897 --> 00:12:13,442
- Exactly.
- And you're doing it in a cool way.

183
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,777
I wanna have fun, you know?

184
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,363
That's why this thing...

185
00:12:18,697 --> 00:12:21,032
is like this, you know?

186
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,618
That's the ideal, bro.

187
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:25,454
Keep it this way.

188
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:30,375
If something happens after this. If...

189
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:37,340
- That Renato, man.
- What's up?

190
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:43,263
Sometimes it's very difficult
to understand you.

191
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,765
- Why?
- Just because...

192
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:50,562
Sometimes you seem to be open
to some things, then you change.

193
00:12:51,188 --> 00:12:54,399
Sometimes, I think you wanna be with me...

194
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,736
then, all of a sudden, you don't.

195
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,197
It's a little difficult.

196
00:13:00,864 --> 00:13:04,117
And I don't know what to think.

197
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,995
This is what affects me the most.

198
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:09,623
Not knowing what you want.

199
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,251
I have more doubts than you.

200
00:13:17,964 --> 00:13:22,093
Could be. When I thought I knew,
we had a bad fight.

201
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,930
That makes me drift apart even more.

202
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,932
It's not about drifting apart.

203
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,850
It is.

204
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,019
It's just...

205
00:13:32,437 --> 00:13:37,442
Sometimes, you don't know
what you're saying. When you're wasted.

206
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:39,569
- You either.
- You say things,

207
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:42,113
- Mu, what happened there...
- and I am...

208
00:13:42,489 --> 00:13:44,699
- You freaked out.
- No, I didn't.

209
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:46,743
- No, I did not.
- Yes, you did.

210
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:55,877
The boys are downstairs?

211
00:13:56,002 --> 00:13:59,297
I guess. I'm going downstairs,
I need to pee.

212
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:01,841
I'll be right down.

213
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:32,956
- Is it here?
- Yes, let's go!

214
00:14:32,956 --> 00:14:34,249
Let's go!

215
00:14:37,586 --> 00:14:39,713
Let's work, girls.

216
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,424
- Come get some air.
- Let's go.

217
00:14:43,425 --> 00:14:45,552
- I'm lazy.
- Me, too. We are so pretty.

218
00:14:45,552 --> 00:14:47,554
I was born lazy.

219
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:07,657
Hey, Murilão! My favorite inked man.
How are you?

220
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:11,786
I have some news. I think it's good.

221
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,873
Oh! You son of a bitch!

222
00:15:14,873 --> 00:15:16,458
I'm in Floripa.

223
00:15:16,625 --> 00:15:18,877
Let's go wild on this island.

224
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:22,088
Give me your address.

225
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,965
I'm coming!

226
00:15:24,382 --> 00:15:26,885
Fuck, I can't believe he's coming.

227
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,678
Son of a bitch!

228
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:31,806
Are you okay? What's up?

229
00:15:32,474 --> 00:15:34,893
Hey, Grijó, you punk!

230
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:37,604
I'm waiting for you, dude.

231
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,230
Let's go!

232
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:43,818
Where are you, brother?
Fuck, I fucking miss you, man!

233
00:15:44,402 --> 00:15:45,904
Fuck, man!

234
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:49,491
Come on over, things are gonna go wild.

235
00:15:51,785 --> 00:15:54,663
I can't believe this, my brother's coming.

236
00:15:54,871 --> 00:15:55,955
Fuck!

237
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:57,916
This is gonna be crazy, dude.

238
00:15:57,916 --> 00:16:00,043
Now you're talking, dude.

239
00:16:10,011 --> 00:16:11,346
Good evening!

240
00:16:11,638 --> 00:16:12,764
Welcome!

241
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:27,987
The taxi is here.

242
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:29,948
This must be him.

243
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,620
Here!

244
00:16:35,787 --> 00:16:38,665
I told you I was coming.

245
00:16:39,749 --> 00:16:41,876
Let's take over the world, dude!

246
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,505
Fuck, bro, this is great!

247
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,881
What's up?

248
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,883
How are you, bro?

249
00:16:49,342 --> 00:16:51,302
Fuck, my man!

250
00:16:51,636 --> 00:16:53,263
Fuck, bro!

251
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:54,931
Beautiful house, brother.

252
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:58,059
- Hi, man.
- Ramonzinho, Renatinho.

253
00:16:58,184 --> 00:17:00,729
- Pedrão.
- Are you good?

254
00:17:00,937 --> 00:17:04,023
- Come on. No way, bro.
- You're home, man.

255
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:05,942
Fuck, bro!

256
00:17:06,067 --> 00:17:07,527
We're here, dude!

257
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:09,779
Let's take over the world?

258
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:11,489
Let's meet the girls.

259
00:17:16,035 --> 00:17:18,121
- I'm working, baby.
- I know.

260
00:17:18,413 --> 00:17:19,456
How are you?

261
00:17:21,374 --> 00:17:23,877
- What have you got for us?
- Sex on the beach,

262
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:28,423
gin and tonic, strawberry...
Lime caipirinha and beer.

263
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:30,800
- Lime, man!
- Two of those.

264
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:33,928
- Two gins.
- I didn't see hot guys!

265
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,431
- Two gins.
- You didn't?

266
00:17:37,682 --> 00:17:39,559
- I saw people.
- Okay, two gins...

267
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,770
- Take it easy.
- ...two sex on the beach.

268
00:17:41,936 --> 00:17:43,521
Give me one glass.

269
00:17:45,523 --> 00:17:48,568
- I'll be back to take more orders.
- It's for Andrei.

270
00:17:50,779 --> 00:17:52,322
The hood.

271
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,621
- Thanks.
- I'm watching, you know?

272
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,164
Thanks.

273
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,840
That's an exception, right?
A kiss like this.

274
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:14,344
Oh, that's disgusting, my God.

275
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:23,311
You may order.

276
00:18:23,436 --> 00:18:24,938
May I? Excuse me.

277
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,066
- No touching or I'll be jealous.
- I want a lime one.

278
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:29,317
I want a lime one.

279
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:32,153
- Excuse me. Sorry.
- You're so fresh!

280
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,280
Two... Caipirinhas, right?

281
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:38,910
Two caipirinhas.
Where are the other tokens?

282
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,538
You didn't pay attention, you idiot.

283
00:18:42,497 --> 00:18:43,832
No comment.

284
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:47,502
I have a lot of questions.
If you cheat on me...

285
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,128
That's it!

286
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,089
Can we start dating after this?

287
00:18:54,676 --> 00:18:58,179
I didn't hook up with anybody,
I was stalling

288
00:18:58,179 --> 00:19:00,265
- to hook up with you.
- Andrei!

289
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,393
I was cheated on again.

290
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:08,147
If you take Bebeto, you take Romário too.

291
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:09,482
You two are a set.

292
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:11,651
You take Bebeto, you take Romário.

293
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,195
Fuck!

294
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:16,573
Oh, it's not possible.

295
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:18,658
My man is here.

296
00:19:18,658 --> 00:19:21,744
Ask any one of them
if I hooked up with anybody!

297
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:22,829
What?

298
00:19:22,954 --> 00:19:26,457
- Girl, there's another guy with them.
- He's Murilo's friend.

299
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,376
Come here, Nath.

300
00:19:29,419 --> 00:19:31,337
- Pedro.
- Who might you be?

301
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,047
My friend from Brasília.

302
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,050
- Welcome, Pedro.
- Nathália, Grijó.

303
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,262
- Nice to meet you.
- Grijó, my friend from Brasília.

304
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:40,513
Hi, how are you?

305
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:42,140
Nice to meet you.

306
00:19:42,557 --> 00:19:44,934
Let me introduce you to the girls.

307
00:19:45,143 --> 00:19:46,644
Come here.

308
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:49,647
- Hi.
- Tay, Pedro.

309
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:51,232
Nice to meet you.

310
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:53,026
Who is this?

311
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:56,613
- Say you're Ísis Valverde.
- No!

312
00:19:59,699 --> 00:20:01,743
- Let's go, dude!
- She's hot, right?

313
00:20:02,368 --> 00:20:03,953
Too bad she's hot, right?

314
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:07,749
She's great, she's hot, I like her.

315
00:20:09,292 --> 00:20:14,964
One for all and all for one!
One for all and all for one!

316
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:19,135
Fuck!

317
00:20:19,636 --> 00:20:21,429
I need to talk to you later.

318
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:23,431
Okay, later...

319
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:25,892
She's the girl, right?

320
00:20:29,354 --> 00:20:31,439
A glass of orange juice, please?

321
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:32,690
Orange juice?

322
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,818
Do you want ice?

323
00:20:35,818 --> 00:20:38,363
No, I want to drink an energy drink

324
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:41,115
with vodka, no.

325
00:20:43,201 --> 00:20:44,577
Thank you.

326
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:52,168
Do I let the girls go?

327
00:20:52,585 --> 00:20:54,921
They've already worked a lot tonight.

328
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,839
You said they did a good job.

329
00:21:00,343 --> 00:21:01,761
Do you think that's work?

330
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,721
That's the afterparty.

331
00:21:05,014 --> 00:21:08,393
- That's fucked up, buddy. Let them go!
- Let us go!

332
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:11,229
- Let them go!
- Girls, you're free to have fun.

333
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:39,090
Hi!

334
00:21:40,216 --> 00:21:42,093
Good evening, ladies.

335
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:43,052
Good evening!

336
00:21:51,936 --> 00:21:53,604
Are you taking that guy home?

337
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:55,440
- Am I not supposed to?
- What?

338
00:21:55,648 --> 00:21:56,983
Am I not supposed to?

339
00:21:57,150 --> 00:21:59,193
No, it's up to you.

340
00:21:59,193 --> 00:22:03,197
- I was gonna take him, but...
- I didn't hook up because of you.

341
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,075
- But I didn't know about this.
- Bro...

342
00:22:06,075 --> 00:22:09,162
but what did you tell me when I got here?

343
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:15,460
Come here. We have to make a deal.

344
00:22:15,626 --> 00:22:18,296
No, what did you tell me when I got here?

345
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:21,674
"If you hooked up with a girl,
I'd grab her by the hair."

346
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:23,843
But now I wanna understand.

347
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:28,097
But, look, we made a deal,
we can do whatever we want, and...

348
00:22:28,306 --> 00:22:30,683
when we want to be together, we'll do it.

349
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,727
But we are free.

350
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:34,937
It's our deal, since the beginning.

351
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:37,231
I can't tell you tonight,

352
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:40,985
"Let's stay together," because
I can tell you this now

353
00:22:41,152 --> 00:22:43,863
- and, in two hours, I'll tell...
- It's not this.

354
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:46,783
- Exactly.
- I'd rather tell you this tonight.

355
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:49,035
- I'm confused.
- So am I.

356
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:51,996
I'd rather take my time
and think about what I want.

357
00:22:51,996 --> 00:22:53,873
And I think you understand

358
00:22:53,873 --> 00:22:56,876
- I do.
- that I'm playing fair with you.

359
00:23:00,588 --> 00:23:01,839
Just say "Okay".

360
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:05,301
Anna's boy needs to drop
by a birthday party near our house.

361
00:23:05,468 --> 00:23:07,386
No, he'll go later.

362
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,888
Anna said that, "Wait."

363
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,264
- Anna?
- Yes.

364
00:23:10,264 --> 00:23:11,933
- Anna or Nath?
- Anna.

365
00:23:12,433 --> 00:23:14,102
Anna? Nath's boy.

366
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,020
That Anna's boy.

367
00:23:16,270 --> 00:23:19,065
- Isn't she with Renatinho?
- She invited the boy.

368
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:23,820
Renatinho dumped a chick,
I told her, "I'll tell Renatinho."

369
00:23:23,986 --> 00:23:25,613
Fuck, that's fucked up.

370
00:23:25,613 --> 00:23:27,365
They are not a couple.

371
00:23:27,365 --> 00:23:28,616
No.

372
00:23:28,616 --> 00:23:31,327
We don't need anything,
we just need ourselves.

373
00:23:35,998 --> 00:23:39,710
Where are the afterparty people?

374
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:44,632
There's a party tonight
in the lagoon house,

375
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:46,801
on us!

376
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:52,849
Let's go! Hit it, DJ!

377
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,119
You want to see a lot.

378
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:16,289
- I'm from Rio.
- I'm from Niterói.

379
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:19,625
- That's rad!
- Excuse me.

380
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:20,710
Sure, sit down.

381
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:23,796
I'm here in the corner.
The three of us fit in here.

382
00:24:24,505 --> 00:24:25,882
We can fit three!

383
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:27,967
Oh, I'm cool.

384
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:30,678
I just drink and smoke cigarettes.

385
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:32,346
He's kissing a girl there.

386
00:24:32,346 --> 00:24:33,598
- Who?
- Look.

387
00:24:36,684 --> 00:24:39,729
If he sleeps with her,
I don't know how I'll react.

388
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:42,315
You'll react
by fucking another guy tomorrow.

389
00:24:55,203 --> 00:24:57,038
It's Renato... Is it that girl?

390
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:00,917
If they do it in my bed, I'll be pissed.

391
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:03,920
Me too!

392
00:25:04,086 --> 00:25:06,881
It's not just your bed,
it's Nath's too, right?

393
00:25:06,881 --> 00:25:10,218
If he's going there with that girl...

394
00:25:10,343 --> 00:25:12,220
I waited to have sex with a guy.

395
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:16,307
He got here, I had sex with him
and I don't know.

396
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,268
I don't care
if he hooks up with everybody,

397
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:21,270
I joke around, like...

398
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:23,940
I said... Stop looking at Bia!

399
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:27,193
Girl, looks like you're a little hurt,

400
00:25:27,193 --> 00:25:28,986
and you don't wanna admit it.

401
00:25:29,111 --> 00:25:31,113
You are a little jealous.

402
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:32,657
Jealous of the situation.

403
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:34,700
I think it's impossible that you

404
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:38,079
- don't feel anything.
- But when he wants me, I don't.

405
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:40,831
- So, what is it?
- Ego.

406
00:25:41,457 --> 00:25:43,626
Go, Ramon is coming before you, go.

407
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:46,629
Ask him to go to the sex room,
if anything happens.

408
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:49,131
Ask her to leave.

409
00:25:50,216 --> 00:25:52,927
Girl, you're doing this.

410
00:25:53,135 --> 00:25:55,263
You can't hook up with another guy,

411
00:25:55,263 --> 00:25:57,098
you're getting in his way.

412
00:25:57,390 --> 00:25:59,141
You're getting in his way now.

413
00:25:59,308 --> 00:26:01,102
Tomorrow you kiss another boy.

414
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:03,104
I don't want it in my bed.

415
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:04,146
I didn't check.

416
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:05,523
She'll leave.

417
00:26:05,648 --> 00:26:06,732
- You're hurt.
- No!

418
00:26:06,899 --> 00:26:09,735
You gotta be honest, you know?

419
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:13,990
Don't give a shit about him tomorrow
because he'll do the same.

420
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,158
Wait, you are hooking up with whom?

421
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:18,327
Renatinho.

422
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:19,996
I don't feel anything.

423
00:26:19,996 --> 00:26:24,917
How can you have feelings
for anybody in four days, girl?

424
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,341
You can't.

425
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:33,509
Man, this is...

426
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:37,722
Fuck, Tay. Listen.

427
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:40,266
Oh, girl, I won't listen, girl.

428
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:42,310
That hurts. I know.

429
00:26:43,144 --> 00:26:45,688
Oh, I don't wanna be here.

430
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:52,486
Oh, girl, I wish I hadn't listened.

431
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:55,781
Come on, you wanted to.

432
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:58,868
I know, I wanted it this way.

433
00:26:58,993 --> 00:27:01,412
- It happens.
- I saw him doing

434
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:02,955
what he does to me.

435
00:27:03,164 --> 00:27:04,665
It happens.

436
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:07,710
You didn't want him, you ended it,

437
00:27:08,586 --> 00:27:10,087
now you just move on.

438
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,591
- It's no use being sad.
- That's fucked up!

439
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:18,929
Someone wants to use it.

440
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:20,056
- Nath.
- I get it.

441
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:30,775
Let me see how it is. Turn around now.

442
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:33,402
Top-notch, girl!

443
00:27:34,445 --> 00:27:36,864
Look at this, Ramon, look at this.

444
00:27:36,989 --> 00:27:38,699
Look at this.

445
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:40,826
Wow!

446
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:43,079
I wish I had an ass like that.

447
00:27:43,245 --> 00:27:45,289
Easy. The camera.

448
00:27:45,748 --> 00:27:48,959
The camera. Wonderful, go.

449
00:27:53,381 --> 00:27:55,966
Look, girl, look. The trending cover.

450
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:03,599
No, man. Andrei!

451
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:07,478
- Hey, man, what a shame.
- Come, boy, leave.

452
00:28:07,603 --> 00:28:08,979
- Go!
- No!

453
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:13,651
See? There you go.

454
00:28:13,859 --> 00:28:15,611
Meaning she likes him.

455
00:28:15,611 --> 00:28:19,031
That's crazy, I thought
she was totally free,

456
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:22,243
- but no.

457
00:28:22,243 --> 00:28:25,121
- I think she's upset.
- She doesn't like him.

458
00:28:25,287 --> 00:28:26,330
Renatinho.

459
00:28:26,622 --> 00:28:29,208
No, she's crying, she's sad because...

460
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:33,671
I think she invented
an imaginary rule in her head,

461
00:28:34,255 --> 00:28:36,424
an imaginary limit he crossed.

462
00:28:36,757 --> 00:28:38,801
Buddy, you don't even believe that.

463
00:28:39,009 --> 00:28:42,221
No, it's difficult for "Dr." John Drops.

464
00:28:42,221 --> 00:28:44,390
Guys, it's obvious, she's upset.

465
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:46,892
She's hurt, I thought she was free.

466
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,310
I agree. She's hurt.

467
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,938
Hearing your ex having sex
must be upsetting.

468
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:52,565
Guys, that's obvious.

469
00:28:53,023 --> 00:28:56,527
She's upset because of her "F.B."
not because she likes him.

470
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:58,070
No, dude.

471
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,197
- What's "F.B."?
- Fuck buddy.

472
00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:01,615
I agree.

473
00:29:01,615 --> 00:29:05,703
She had a permanent "F.B." in the house...

474
00:29:05,828 --> 00:29:07,746
- I agree.
- ...but they were free.

475
00:29:07,746 --> 00:29:08,998
I don't agree.

476
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:12,751
But he crossed the line
and took a girl home and hurt her.

477
00:29:12,877 --> 00:29:14,712
I think it's like this.

478
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,465
She doesn't like the guy, just his dick.

479
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:20,509
- What?
- She just likes his dick.

480
00:29:20,676 --> 00:29:22,428
She doesn't like him!

481
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:23,929
She does...

482
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:26,765
She doesn't like him,
but she likes the sex.

483
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:30,561
If she could detach his dick,
she'd take it?

484
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:32,438
- Is that it?
- Exactly.

485
00:29:32,646 --> 00:29:35,941
I wanna hear somebody
who almost said nothing.

486
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:38,486
- What?
- What do you think

487
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,946
about this situation?

488
00:29:41,155 --> 00:29:42,948
If I were in her shoes,

489
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:46,076
I would handle it differently.

490
00:29:46,243 --> 00:29:51,707
Or I would let the guy fuck and be cool.

491
00:29:52,041 --> 00:29:55,920
Or I'd do like Anna, hook up
and leave, but I think I would stay.

492
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:58,839
I wonder if we are too detached.

493
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:03,469
Oh, girl, I don't believe it,
that "we're all detached".

494
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:07,223
- Here, in this show, I pretend I am...
- You are!

495
00:30:07,431 --> 00:30:09,141
...but deep inside I also am!

496
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:10,768
That's not possible.

497
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:12,269
Guys, let me speak.

498
00:30:12,686 --> 00:30:15,731
Pabllo is the most detached person
I've ever met.

499
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:17,983
She should be studied.

500
00:30:17,983 --> 00:30:20,611
Love, a whore's love...

501
00:30:20,611 --> 00:30:22,863
"Whore's Love" suits her perfectly.

502
00:30:22,863 --> 00:30:26,116
Now let's understand
one subject we didn't talk about,

503
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:31,914
a big problem,
Bia's pregnancy test, if it were positive.

504
00:30:32,498 --> 00:30:33,582
The show would end.

505
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:37,002
Tell me what you'd do, if you were Bia.

506
00:30:37,002 --> 00:30:40,297
I would call my mom and say,
"Hi, Mom, I'm pregnant."

507
00:30:40,422 --> 00:30:44,802
I would have the child
and give it away to his family.

508
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:48,013
- I swear to God.
- Stop it!

509
00:30:48,013 --> 00:30:50,057
- Really, Carol?
- I swear.

510
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:51,850
I mean it. Really.

511
00:30:51,976 --> 00:30:54,061
You'd carry a baby for nine months,

512
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,521
when you had him,

513
00:30:55,646 --> 00:30:57,731
- you'd give...
- Man, I said that

514
00:30:57,731 --> 00:31:00,651
- because... All men I've met...
- She'd do that.

515
00:31:00,901 --> 00:31:04,280
I said, "Man, don't try to play me, bro."

516
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:07,992
Some men try to play you.
"I'd like to have a daughter..."

517
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:11,662
But I wouldn't have a daughter
with a jerk, you know?

518
00:31:12,371 --> 00:31:14,206
With a guy I had sex with...

519
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,499
Girl...

520
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:17,585
...and he did it to fuck with me.

521
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:20,546
Hear me out.
You're so amazing that no jerk

522
00:31:20,713 --> 00:31:23,340
would make a difference to your life.

523
00:31:23,716 --> 00:31:27,177
Anything created inside of you
would be wonderful.

524
00:31:27,469 --> 00:31:28,804
But guys...

525
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:31,724
my best friend had the same problem,

526
00:31:31,724 --> 00:31:35,394
I went with her to buy the test.
That feeling is very weird,

527
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:38,314
the person forgets everything
and goes to buy a test.

528
00:31:38,689 --> 00:31:41,275
- It's terrifying.
- Girl, it's terrifying.

529
00:31:41,275 --> 00:31:45,112
In Salvador, we say,
"Even hot palm oil doesn't get through."

530
00:31:45,237 --> 00:31:47,573
I never saw this in any other reality.

531
00:31:47,781 --> 00:31:50,826
I'm gonna hit play, guys. Let's go!

532
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:52,328
Play!

533
00:32:07,301 --> 00:32:10,346
Look, be careful with that woman.
Look what she does.

534
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:13,474
- What?
- Here. Look at my arm.

535
00:32:14,183 --> 00:32:15,809
Who did this?

536
00:32:15,809 --> 00:32:17,645
- Nathália.
- What's that?

537
00:32:17,895 --> 00:32:20,147
Don't joke around with her.

538
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:22,816
She might scratch your arm.

539
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:25,611
If she sees you
surrounded by too many girls!

540
00:32:26,278 --> 00:32:28,072
Yeah, that's what she does.

541
00:32:28,238 --> 00:32:29,531
Why have enemies!

542
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:31,950
She sticks her nails into your arm.

543
00:32:32,117 --> 00:32:33,827
Hair pulling...

544
00:32:33,994 --> 00:32:36,330
Glasses in the face.

545
00:32:38,165 --> 00:32:40,751
- He's sad!
- What?

546
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,836
You're sad today. Quiet.

547
00:32:43,087 --> 00:32:44,463
I am.

548
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:47,091
- Feeling sorry?
-"I am."

549
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:49,593
Guys, let's clear the table.

550
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,970
No comment.

551
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:55,557
What were you doing?

552
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:59,478
Let me see, Murilo.
Where are yesterday's pictures?

553
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:01,063
This one is not...

554
00:33:01,772 --> 00:33:03,691
I threw our picture away.

555
00:33:03,941 --> 00:33:05,651
You kissed and did some blow.

556
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:07,569
I threw our picture away.

557
00:33:07,695 --> 00:33:10,656
He didn't do any blow!

558
00:33:10,864 --> 00:33:12,449
Bullshit.

559
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:19,206
- Damn.
- It's not here yet.

560
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,083
It's even better.

561
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:22,918
Put the new pictures there.

562
00:33:23,085 --> 00:33:25,170
You can throw this away. Where is it?

563
00:33:26,088 --> 00:33:27,297
Where is it?

564
00:33:27,631 --> 00:33:29,508
Here, you can throw this away.

565
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:31,593
Can I? Okay.

566
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:32,970
Why is that?

567
00:33:33,095 --> 00:33:34,596
I don't know.

568
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:35,681
Who threw it away?

569
00:33:35,848 --> 00:33:38,559
I threw it away because we had a fight.

570
00:33:38,684 --> 00:33:40,310
No, return it, put it back!

571
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,937
- No, Tay.
- Why did she do that?

572
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:43,731
What an angry girl.

573
00:33:44,732 --> 00:33:46,316
That's bullshit.

574
00:33:46,442 --> 00:33:48,736
That's bullshit!

575
00:33:50,070 --> 00:33:51,363
Oh, my God.

576
00:33:51,363 --> 00:33:53,991
Because we broke up
the day I got the picture.

577
00:33:54,408 --> 00:33:57,536
- Sometimes, I'm just like you.
- You're such a baby.

578
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,664
He said, "Throw everything away."

579
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:04,209
He didn't mean that,
he wasn't serious about this, right?

580
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:06,587
Don't ask me anymore.

581
00:34:12,176 --> 00:34:13,552
Throw yourself away.

582
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:18,432
- I've already done it.
- Old news. That was way back.

583
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:20,851
Since we got together.

584
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:23,353
Oh, my God, what's that for, guys?

585
00:34:35,699 --> 00:34:39,578
Look, mark my words,
Anna won't do the dishes anymore.

586
00:34:40,662 --> 00:34:43,540
Anna doesn't feel like talking. Bullshit.

587
00:34:44,541 --> 00:34:45,918
I'm gonna have to talk,

588
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,295
wanna come with me to help me?

589
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,631
I can't avoid this anymore.

590
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,555
Tell me, what's the problem?

591
00:35:00,057 --> 00:35:01,517
You...

592
00:35:01,683 --> 00:35:04,228
- What?
- You're the one who wants to talk.

593
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,438
I'm fine.

594
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:10,025
No, not fine.
I was talking to you, and you...

595
00:35:10,526 --> 00:35:13,237
I don't know,
I was minding my own business...

596
00:35:13,779 --> 00:35:16,073
I don't know, I didn't see this coming.

597
00:35:17,574 --> 00:35:19,117
I didn't see this coming,

598
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:23,455
but... It happens, it happens a lot.

599
00:35:23,747 --> 00:35:27,417
You bring a girl, hook up with her,
have sex with her, it happens.

600
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:33,006
That's because, like, I say, fuck...

601
00:35:33,006 --> 00:35:37,469
Bro, I was upset because
I have feelings for you, I realized

602
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:39,972
this affected you somehow, you know?

603
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:44,351
If you were in my shoes,
how would you react?

604
00:35:44,518 --> 00:35:48,772
If you're fine with this, I am too.
If you're not, it's not.

605
00:35:49,231 --> 00:35:51,441
That's simple. There's no mistake.

606
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:55,696
I just don't want this to affect
our relationship, you know?

607
00:35:55,696 --> 00:36:01,493
Yesterday I wasn't in the mood
to say anything. What was I gonna say?

608
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:04,162
I wasn't in the mood, you know?

609
00:36:04,329 --> 00:36:09,084
This won't affect us, sorry. I did this,

610
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:12,880
but this won't affect us because,
before we hooked up,

611
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,466
we were becoming friends,
so, it's gonna be the same way.

612
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:17,885
It won't change.

613
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:21,388
I did this. It won't happen again.

614
00:36:21,847 --> 00:36:25,434
I made a mistake,
but I'm cool, I'm not upset.

615
00:36:25,726 --> 00:36:29,396
These things happen,
you're home, your home is my home,

616
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:31,106
we do whatever we want.

617
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,026
That's fucked up.
I didn't want this today,

618
00:36:34,234 --> 00:36:35,986
you know?

619
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:39,031
It's not worth it, you know?

620
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:41,533
I know, but...

621
00:36:41,533 --> 00:36:44,369
I wasn't gonna be this fucking way...

622
00:36:44,369 --> 00:36:46,288
We go out every day,

623
00:36:46,288 --> 00:36:49,499
if we bring people home,

624
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:51,793
we won't talk to each other again.

625
00:36:51,793 --> 00:36:53,420
- I know.
- You know?

626
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:58,842
That's why we have to come to...
Fuck, you know?

627
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:02,638
What bothers you? What doesn't bother you?

628
00:37:02,930 --> 00:37:05,724
But that's the problem,
it just bothered me.

629
00:37:06,308 --> 00:37:08,644
It bothered me you had sex.

630
00:37:08,852 --> 00:37:13,023
You won't have sex again?
This can't happen, I have to accept it.

631
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,441
You know?

632
00:37:14,441 --> 00:37:17,903
We go out every day,
we have afterparties...

633
00:37:18,695 --> 00:37:21,406
You wanna be with others,
I wanna be with others.

634
00:37:21,531 --> 00:37:23,659
We can't deny ourselves.

635
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:26,078
Like it or not,

636
00:37:26,078 --> 00:37:28,789
I'm sorry for us.

637
00:37:29,498 --> 00:37:34,169
Tomorrow is a new day.
Like, I slept, woke up, and it was fine.

638
00:37:34,169 --> 00:37:35,379
Like...

639
00:37:35,545 --> 00:37:40,092
Listening to that was a consequence,
like, what am I gonna do?

640
00:37:40,884 --> 00:37:42,219
That's it!

641
00:37:43,595 --> 00:37:46,014
It's all right.

642
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:50,394
I swear. Okay?

643
00:37:50,519 --> 00:37:52,354
It's okay.

644
00:38:00,696 --> 00:38:01,822
"Baby Shark"!

645
00:38:01,822 --> 00:38:03,865
Baby Shark

646
00:38:04,032 --> 00:38:05,450
When I was 16...

647
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,703
Did you sing "Baby Shark"?

648
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:11,540
Bye. See you later, don't take too long.

649
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,793
Bye.

650
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:37,691
Oh, that's the phone.

651
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,781
I'm gonna see.

652
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:47,367
What's up, guys?

653
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:51,329
Today I need the boys
at the bar, night shift.

654
00:38:51,997 --> 00:38:54,249
- See you later.
- Let's work, guys.

655
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:56,668
You know what I'll do?

656
00:38:56,668 --> 00:39:00,422
I'm gonna call Amanda.
At least I'll have company at the bar.

657
00:39:01,256 --> 00:39:04,301
I didn't have one yesterday.
I'll have one today.

658
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:05,635
I want one too.

659
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:07,429
Get out.

660
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:09,097
Come on, fag.

661
00:39:09,264 --> 00:39:11,975
I'm gonna call somebody.
Don't you have someone?

662
00:39:13,226 --> 00:39:14,269
I don't know.

663
00:39:14,269 --> 00:39:16,313
Oh, work it out for yourself.

664
00:39:23,612 --> 00:39:24,821
Let's go!

665
00:39:24,821 --> 00:39:27,324
Girls, we'll be right back. We're working.

666
00:39:29,493 --> 00:39:31,286
That's okay, man.

667
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:35,665
Let's get to work.

668
00:39:39,211 --> 00:39:41,463
- I hear the phone ringing.
- Jeez.

669
00:39:41,588 --> 00:39:43,090
I hear the phone.

670
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:47,219
All I need is Ricardo saying
he needs us to work at the bar.

671
00:39:55,352 --> 00:39:56,520
Hi...

672
00:39:57,270 --> 00:39:59,981
- Hi, girl!
- Not possible!

673
00:40:00,982 --> 00:40:02,359
How are you, my love?

674
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:05,070
I'm fine, I miss you!

675
00:40:05,362 --> 00:40:08,657
- Me too!
- I'm gonna ruin my makeup.

676
00:40:08,657 --> 00:40:10,826
- What's up?
- Do you know where I am?

677
00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:12,452
No, where?

678
00:40:12,744 --> 00:40:14,287
- Who's this?
- Where?

679
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,872
Is this Rayanne?

680
00:40:16,706 --> 00:40:19,042
Where, fuck? Are you in Floripa?

681
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:21,294
- In Floripa!
- You're messing with me.

682
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:25,382
- Guys, it's Nath's friend!
- You and Matheus!

683
00:40:25,632 --> 00:40:27,509
I can't believe this!

684
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:30,303
I can't believe this!

685
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:32,639
Okay, I love you guys.

686
00:40:34,141 --> 00:40:35,559
Bye.

687
00:40:38,186 --> 00:40:39,688
Oh, Lord.

688
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:42,482
Oh, my makeup.

689
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:44,776
Guys, Ray and my gay friend are here.

690
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,155
Your gay friend, awesome!

691
00:40:48,405 --> 00:40:51,283
Guys, you're gonna love them, I swear.

692
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:53,869
Ray mocks more than me.

693
00:40:54,161 --> 00:40:57,038
Be careful with our boys,
Matheus hits on them.

694
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:08,675
- Good evening!
- Good evening!

695
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:10,552
How are you? Welcome!

696
00:41:13,805 --> 00:41:15,473
Four beers.

697
00:41:19,269 --> 00:41:21,146
That's it, you have to toast!

698
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:26,234
- Let's drink!
- Good evening, girls. Can I help you?

699
00:41:26,234 --> 00:41:28,069
How are you? Nice to meet you.

700
00:41:28,195 --> 00:41:30,488
What about that carioca accent?

701
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:32,449
- Did you like it?
- Yes.

702
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:35,452
- Oh, good. Alana, right?
- Kiss!

703
00:41:35,577 --> 00:41:40,248
When's the shot time, when everybody
takes off their shirts and throws it up?

704
00:41:40,457 --> 00:41:42,250
Look. Ramon!

705
00:41:42,417 --> 00:41:45,378
You have to make a deal with him.

706
00:41:45,587 --> 00:41:49,216
One shot so the waiters take
the shirt off, and we get drunk.

707
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:51,092
Make a deal with him.

708
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:52,761
With the buddy!

709
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:54,179
I'll arrange this.

710
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:02,979
Go, Nath!

711
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:05,440
Oh, guys, I really don't like this.

712
00:42:06,066 --> 00:42:08,235
Of course I do!

713
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,074
I think I drowned.

714
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:16,076
You had sex.

715
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:20,747
You're rushing things, Nath.

716
00:42:22,374 --> 00:42:26,002
Cheers to our night, it's gonna be epic,
better than that one.

717
00:42:26,169 --> 00:42:29,089
Better than that one.

718
00:42:29,089 --> 00:42:32,259
Better... Better than that one.

719
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,344
Let all hell break loose.

720
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:35,720
God bless!

721
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:37,055
Let's take a picture!

722
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,809
Let's go!

723
00:42:47,816 --> 00:42:51,861
What happens in a night-out
stays in a night-out!

724
00:42:59,327 --> 00:43:01,246
How are you?

725
00:43:01,788 --> 00:43:03,164
Hi!

726
00:43:22,309 --> 00:43:24,269
No, I'm very happy, really.

727
00:43:24,436 --> 00:43:26,187
I love it!

728
00:43:26,354 --> 00:43:29,024
There's a hot guy wearing a white t-shirt.

729
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:30,984
A hot one!

730
00:43:31,151 --> 00:43:33,111
Get one for me and one for you.

731
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,113
You know it, right?

732
00:43:35,864 --> 00:43:37,824
I counted the guys I hooked up with.

733
00:43:37,991 --> 00:43:39,701
He must be around.

734
00:43:40,994 --> 00:43:44,247
We fuck for free.
Line up and come, one at a time, baby.

735
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,175
Hi!

736
00:43:55,342 --> 00:43:57,260
How are you?

737
00:43:57,385 --> 00:43:58,928
When did you get in Floripa?

738
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:00,180
I got here today.

739
00:44:04,809 --> 00:44:06,603
Hey, chug, go!

740
00:44:25,538 --> 00:44:28,875
Fuck! Man, don't do what they say.

741
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:31,044
Don't drink this way, you'll die.

742
00:44:31,169 --> 00:44:33,129
You'll die!

743
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:34,214
Shut up.

744
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:42,180
Are you gonna start or not?

745
00:44:43,390 --> 00:44:46,434
You kiss everyone here...

746
00:44:46,559 --> 00:44:48,853
You think I want all the girls in here?

747
00:44:57,028 --> 00:44:58,738
Andrei's here, where's Nath?

748
00:44:58,738 --> 00:45:00,365
Andrei's here.

749
00:45:01,074 --> 00:45:03,993
Nath can't hook up
with another boy anymore.

750
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:07,080
Oh, I'm gonna do nothing.

751
00:45:10,667 --> 00:45:12,252
Andrei's here.

752
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:14,963
Really? I thought so.

753
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:17,590
There'll be another scandal.

754
00:45:19,467 --> 00:45:20,593
It's fucked up!

755
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,182
Nath has a big problem, right?

756
00:45:26,349 --> 00:45:27,684
Big problem.

757
00:45:27,684 --> 00:45:31,104
Anna told me, "What now?
What are we gonna do?"

758
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:34,149
Oh, I'm gonna do nothing. Me, nothing.

759
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:54,627
But she...

760
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:58,047
She doesn't give a shit and she's right.

761
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,342
He's always at parties, you know?

762
00:46:01,968 --> 00:46:03,636
Take it or leave it.

763
00:46:03,636 --> 00:46:05,180
Boys just leave!

764
00:46:05,513 --> 00:46:07,015
I want it.

765
00:46:07,432 --> 00:46:08,892
Bro, this...

766
00:46:09,225 --> 00:46:10,560
Where to?

767
00:46:15,315 --> 00:46:18,526
Nath, you do whatever you want, man.

768
00:46:18,860 --> 00:46:20,820
Of course, I wanna kiss you,

769
00:46:21,154 --> 00:46:23,656
- but you're gonna be upset with me.
- No!

770
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:25,241
Of course not?

771
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:27,619
Your hook-ups before...

772
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:31,206
No, it was after.

773
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:35,585
After or before, if you had hooked up...

774
00:46:35,835 --> 00:46:38,296
I'm here for the party, I'm here for you.

775
00:46:38,463 --> 00:46:40,757
If you're happy with him,

776
00:46:41,508 --> 00:46:42,842
you have to choose.

777
00:46:46,054 --> 00:46:47,889
Girl, are you okay?

778
00:46:52,519 --> 00:46:54,562
Don't come closer.

779
00:46:57,232 --> 00:46:58,775
- Are you okay?
- Sure.

780
00:47:00,193 --> 00:47:02,278
- Why?
- What?

781
00:47:02,487 --> 00:47:04,364
Did Nath hook up?

782
00:47:06,449 --> 00:47:07,659
This is hard.

783
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:10,161
- What do I tell him?
- What?

784
00:47:10,370 --> 00:47:12,455
I'm with somebody.

785
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:15,041
I already have two.

786
00:47:15,792 --> 00:47:17,377
- What?
- I already have two.

787
00:47:17,961 --> 00:47:19,462
Do you wanna listen?

788
00:47:19,629 --> 00:47:21,464
- What?
- Do you wanna listen?

789
00:47:21,589 --> 00:47:23,591
Bro, I'm playing like you.

790
00:47:27,303 --> 00:47:28,972
I'm angry with you.

791
00:47:34,978 --> 00:47:36,437
- I found mine.
- Where?

792
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:40,733
Looking here,
I found him, girl! I found him.

793
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:43,027
Wearing a cap? Jeez, girl!

794
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:44,654
Yes, I love it.

795
00:48:11,514 --> 00:48:12,849
It's just us.

796
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:41,878
Guys, look at her mouth!

797
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:43,338
No!

798
00:48:43,338 --> 00:48:45,006
I love it, girl, all smudged.

799
00:48:45,214 --> 00:48:47,467
First rule of a night-out, girls.

800
00:48:47,467 --> 00:48:50,345
You want to kiss?
Wear a nude lipstick, a gloss.

801
00:48:50,470 --> 00:48:53,264
If you wanna strike a pose,
wear a red lipstick.

802
00:48:53,848 --> 00:48:55,183
I came with a nude one.

803
00:48:55,475 --> 00:48:56,976
You'll look like a clown.

804
00:48:57,101 --> 00:48:59,354
- What?
- I came wearing a nude one.

805
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:01,189
John always has nudes.

806
00:49:01,397 --> 00:49:03,858
- And that guy too.
- I only sent you twice.

807
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:06,152
This week, right? Okay.

808
00:49:06,402 --> 00:49:08,363
He got sad.

809
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,239
Whose? Tay's?

810
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:12,325
- What kiss?
- He got sad.

811
00:49:12,533 --> 00:49:14,452
It made my mouth water.

812
00:49:14,619 --> 00:49:17,288
I applaud Nath with my feet, laid down.

813
00:49:17,497 --> 00:49:19,374
Nath was fucking awesome.

814
00:49:19,374 --> 00:49:23,252
Nath, you named this episode,
I'm shocked, honey. Queen of Goiânia.

815
00:49:23,252 --> 00:49:27,507
And Tay also was free there.
She hooked up with one, then another...

816
00:49:27,507 --> 00:49:29,384
Bia is cooler, right?

817
00:49:29,550 --> 00:49:32,303
I believe, for her and Murilo,
it's over for her.

818
00:49:32,929 --> 00:49:33,971
It's over.

819
00:49:34,305 --> 00:49:35,306
I disagree.

820
00:49:35,473 --> 00:49:37,141
- It's over!
- I agree.

821
00:49:37,517 --> 00:49:39,268
It's over, and she gets it.

822
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:41,145
- Lexa?
- Hunting in the night-out.

823
00:49:41,312 --> 00:49:42,980
- Are you anxious?
- I am.

824
00:49:43,106 --> 00:49:45,108
I'm almost dying here!

825
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:48,945
I'm very anxious, I think Tay's sad.

826
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:50,113
- No!
- Yeah, right!

827
00:49:50,238 --> 00:49:51,280
Kissing a lot!

828
00:49:51,489 --> 00:49:53,324
She's gonna look for Murilo.

829
00:49:53,616 --> 00:49:56,577
He loves her, she loves him.

830
00:49:57,036 --> 00:49:59,372
- Pabllo?
- Here, to Murilo and Tay.

831
00:49:59,747 --> 00:50:01,958
I think she's fine at that party.

832
00:50:01,958 --> 00:50:05,420
She'll kiss one more.
I believe she can score three points.

833
00:50:05,545 --> 00:50:07,672
- You wish you were her, right?
- Sure.

834
00:50:07,797 --> 00:50:10,591
But, if she wants Murilo later,
that's okay too.

835
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:13,469
- That's okay!
- Jerry? Hit play.

836
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,221
Let's see it!

837
00:50:15,513 --> 00:50:16,764
ON THE NEXT EPISODE

838
00:50:16,764 --> 00:50:19,559
You know nothing
about what'll happen tomorrow.

839
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:21,185
You know? That's life!

840
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:23,312
What's that for, Murilo?

841
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:25,857
You came, man!
I wanted so bad for you to come.

842
00:50:26,107 --> 00:50:28,568
I was hit and I felt it.

843
00:50:28,735 --> 00:50:29,777
I'm fucked!

844
00:50:33,698 --> 00:50:36,826
We're in Floripa!

845
00:50:37,326 --> 00:50:40,455
Take it easy.
It's a mess but we can manage it.

846
00:50:40,747 --> 00:50:43,124
Renato and Anna drawing attention again!

847
00:50:43,666 --> 00:50:46,252
They're becoming a couple
like Murilo and Tay.

848
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:48,421
They're far from this.

849
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:50,757
Renatinho hooking up, Anna hooking up.

850
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:54,135
- That's good.
- Tay and Murilo started this way.

851
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:56,512
I didn't see who Anna was hugging.

852
00:50:56,846 --> 00:50:59,849
- Oh, that's it.
- But it was a new guy and she...

853
00:50:59,974 --> 00:51:01,267
I think it was Ramon.

854
00:51:01,601 --> 00:51:03,227
A new guy, and she said,

855
00:51:03,603 --> 00:51:05,062
"I'm fucked!"

856
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:07,857
Why? Renatinho was getting there?

857
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:12,570
You heard what they said, I think
it was Renatinho, he said, "She hit me."

858
00:51:12,862 --> 00:51:13,905
Jeez, bro!

859
00:51:14,155 --> 00:51:15,740
Will there be a lot of hits?

860
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:18,534
Guys, I wanna ask something.

861
00:51:18,659 --> 00:51:19,952
What, honey?

862
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:24,207
How many episodes do you need
to start believing me?

863
00:51:24,457 --> 00:51:25,500
I believe you.

864
00:51:25,625 --> 00:51:28,002
This is what life is all about

865
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:29,921
Guys, my car is here, okay?

866
00:51:29,921 --> 00:51:32,340
Pabllo, are you coming with me today?

867
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:33,758
I am. Wait, I just...

868
00:51:33,883 --> 00:51:36,093
That police car is here for John.

869
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,346
That's bad. Jeez, seriously.

870
00:51:38,679 --> 00:51:40,681
After this show, I'm gonna sue you.

871
00:51:40,807 --> 00:51:42,183
- Why?

872
00:51:42,433 --> 00:51:44,769
- Bye, guys!
- Guys, don't fight.

873
00:51:45,019 --> 00:51:47,647
For God's sake.
You can fight, but not here.

874
00:51:47,980 --> 00:51:49,607
With you by...
