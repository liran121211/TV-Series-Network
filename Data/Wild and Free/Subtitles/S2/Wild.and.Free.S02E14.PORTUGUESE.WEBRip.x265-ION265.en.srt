1
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:05,923
Come, daughter!

2
00:00:06,257 --> 00:00:07,258
WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS 2
THE REVIEW

3
00:00:07,258 --> 00:00:08,592
Oh, guys...

4
00:00:08,801 --> 00:00:10,177
It can't.

5
00:00:10,302 --> 00:00:12,471
I have to take my daughter.

6
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:14,515
We're here...

7
00:00:14,515 --> 00:00:17,184
You and Carol came
with the same hairstyle.

8
00:00:17,184 --> 00:00:18,144
You're matching.

9
00:00:18,144 --> 00:00:19,979
It's Pucca and big Pucca.

10
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:21,021
But, buddy...

11
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,022
Two Puccas!

12
00:00:22,273 --> 00:00:23,649
It goes with the plant.

13
00:00:23,649 --> 00:00:24,817
We always match!

14
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:25,901
You're beautiful.

15
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:27,528
We'll go to the same party.

16
00:00:27,528 --> 00:00:28,696
The neon party.

17
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:32,074
- The fairy party.
- Let's not have a fashion show,

18
00:00:32,074 --> 00:00:34,660
but just comment on what inspired you.

19
00:00:34,660 --> 00:00:36,620
What inspired you?
Carol?

20
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:38,122
- Man, I...
- I love it.

21
00:00:38,122 --> 00:00:40,583
I woke up like... in this mood...

22
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:41,917
I wanted to do a bun.

23
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:43,961
What about the green lipstick?

24
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:47,298
I saw the green pencil
and decided to put it on my mouth.

25
00:00:47,298 --> 00:00:49,133
Stand up, turn around for us.

26
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,095
Do your dance moves.

27
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:54,972
What about your dance moves?

28
00:00:57,141 --> 00:00:58,976
Wonderful!

29
00:00:59,268 --> 00:01:01,479
Wow! What about Pabllo?

30
00:01:01,479 --> 00:01:03,773
I'm a fairy who hangs out with Barbie.

31
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:06,150
- Naughty girl, right?
- No, a fairy!

32
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,279
I like to refer to cartoons,
I enjoy animes,

33
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:11,614
I can be who I want.

34
00:01:11,614 --> 00:01:13,699
So can I! What am I today?

35
00:01:13,699 --> 00:01:16,869
Jeez, you're always
very versatile, trendy, super...

36
00:01:17,203 --> 00:01:18,204
And you, John?

37
00:01:18,204 --> 00:01:20,873
I'm went for the "hetero top",
unusual for me.

38
00:01:20,873 --> 00:01:22,666
I'm very discreet!

39
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,210
Look at him, so discreet!

40
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:26,420
I'm not in my milieu!

41
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,756
No, you came as Brokeback Mountain.

42
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:30,382
And you're the other guy.

43
00:01:30,382 --> 00:01:31,342
So, let's go?

44
00:01:31,342 --> 00:01:33,594
No, I don't know if I like you.

45
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,262
So, kiss me. Later...

46
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:38,182
What about you, Lexa?

47
00:01:38,182 --> 00:01:39,975
- I came shining today.
- Versace!

48
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:41,477
I'm totally golden today!

49
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:43,145
Versace, girl!

50
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:45,731
Get up, give us a twirl, dance...

51
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:49,443
- Versace!
- That's it!

52
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,653
Now, Jerry...

53
00:01:50,653 --> 00:01:53,489
came without a bag or a backpack

54
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:55,699
because his pocket can fit a house!

55
00:01:55,699 --> 00:01:57,034
Stand up, Jerry!

56
00:01:57,034 --> 00:01:59,286
- I'll fit in that pocket.
- It's rad!

57
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,538
He's very fashionable.

58
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:02,540
Girl, many things fit in there!

59
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,582
Everything!

60
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:08,087
You're full of yourself,
you'll end up on a catwalk.

61
00:02:08,087 --> 00:02:09,505
Titto didn't dance.

62
00:02:09,505 --> 00:02:10,881
I don't have to...

63
00:02:10,881 --> 00:02:12,216
Give us a twirl!

64
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,600
Thanks a lot. I like funk music.

65
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,726
Episode seven.

66
00:02:22,726 --> 00:02:24,186
I can't believe it, girl!

67
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:25,437
Oh, my God!

68
00:02:25,437 --> 00:02:29,233
Carol is crying tears of arousal
in this... I mean...

69
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:32,236
- You're crying, right, Carol?
- I'm very moved.

70
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:34,905
I'm not ready to say goodbye to you.

71
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,740
No, guys, don't joke around!

72
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:38,075
I'll miss you!

73
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,243
I'm not prepared...

74
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:41,954
There's one more.
This is episode seven, right?

75
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:43,747
Girl, you don't understand.

76
00:02:43,956 --> 00:02:45,624
Do you remember what happened?

77
00:02:45,624 --> 00:02:48,627
Anna heard Renatinho having sex,
do you remember?

78
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:49,837
It was sad!

79
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,088
Are you guys loud?

80
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,965
I'm very reserved having sex,

81
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:54,508
I like something more...

82
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:59,722
You're banging and you say, "Ah."

83
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:01,348
No, I'm...

84
00:03:03,517 --> 00:03:04,852
Like a belly ache.

85
00:03:04,852 --> 00:03:05,895
No, girl!

86
00:03:05,895 --> 00:03:08,147
I'd say, "What is it? Did I fart?"

87
00:03:08,147 --> 00:03:10,107
No, my love, not like that.

88
00:03:10,107 --> 00:03:11,358
I'm making the sound!

89
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:12,276
Bad breath?

90
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:14,111
You have bad breath!

91
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,488
- I did!
- I'm making a sound.

92
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:18,073
Jerry, are you loud?

93
00:03:18,073 --> 00:03:20,451
It depends on how horny I am.

94
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,912
Jerry, what's your level of...

95
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:26,582
horniness, is it like "full of energy"?

96
00:03:26,582 --> 00:03:27,958
I'm full of energy!

97
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,877
I like men that talk to me.

98
00:03:29,877 --> 00:03:31,879
- Yeah, I...
- I like men

99
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:33,005
who spank me.

100
00:03:33,005 --> 00:03:34,465
You like men who talk?

101
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:35,925
What?

102
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,760
- What?
- What did you say?

103
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,511
I like to be spanked...

104
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:40,638
I like them to...

105
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:41,805
Hit your chin...?

106
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,057
Who choke you?

107
00:03:43,057 --> 00:03:44,475
Who choke me!

108
00:03:44,475 --> 00:03:46,226
I like that too.

109
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,561
It's great, guys...

110
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,063
I like to be choked too.

111
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:50,940
To be fucked and choked...

112
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,316
I feel short of breath.

113
00:03:52,316 --> 00:03:53,275
You faint...

114
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:56,654
It's a slight choking,
not a psycho kind of thing.

115
00:03:56,654 --> 00:04:00,074
I like being cursed. "You unemployed!
You bum...".

116
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:02,743
I like being cursed at. I love it!

117
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,828
I don't like being tied up.

118
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,538
You're unemployed

119
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,248
and you have bad breath!

120
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,167
Out of the blue!

121
00:04:10,334 --> 00:04:11,168
What?

122
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:12,628
I don't like being tied.

123
00:04:12,628 --> 00:04:13,963
I don't like it!

124
00:04:13,963 --> 00:04:15,339
God forbid it!

125
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:16,423
That's not sex!

126
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:17,758
But you can choose it.

127
00:04:17,758 --> 00:04:21,470
Hey, Jerry, how's the voice you make?

128
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:25,307
I speak like this
when I have an idea and I have

129
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:26,809
to write a funk song.

130
00:04:27,184 --> 00:04:29,019
Go, naughty girl

131
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,482
Look at John, man.

132
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:35,943
He's caressing his nipple, did you see?

133
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:37,987
Let's hit play!

134
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:39,947
- Let's see it!
- Let's go!

135
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:42,616
Did you kiss anyone?

136
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:45,452
I did, but there were few men yesterday.

137
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:49,540
You don't have problems finding guys!

138
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:52,751
Jeez, I did at the last minute. I swear.

139
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:53,877
It was difficult!

140
00:04:54,128 --> 00:04:55,546
I had a company.

141
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:59,258
Do you see that mature relationship?

142
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:01,176
They're cool, talking...

143
00:05:01,176 --> 00:05:02,970
- I'm loving it!
- That's it!

144
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,389
Totally, right? They are talking...

145
00:05:05,389 --> 00:05:07,766
"I had sex with someone..."

146
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:08,976
Yes, but...

147
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:12,813
They can fall out of love for each other
and be just friends or...

148
00:05:12,813 --> 00:05:14,106
No, I don't think so.

149
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:16,233
This is strengthening their bond!

150
00:05:19,903 --> 00:05:22,114
I made up my mind about the party,

151
00:05:22,114 --> 00:05:24,116
I'll take you to Stage tonight.

152
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,162
Let's go wild!

153
00:05:28,287 --> 00:05:31,790
Nath, is Andrei going? Your hands...

154
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:32,791
Yes!

155
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:33,792
Fine!

156
00:05:33,792 --> 00:05:35,127
Did Andrei stay?

157
00:05:35,127 --> 00:05:37,087
Andrei stayed and is...

158
00:05:37,087 --> 00:05:39,298
Renatinho's friend and everybody's.

159
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:40,841
They took him in well.

160
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:41,925
Yes! They did!

161
00:05:41,925 --> 00:05:42,926
- I liked.
- But...

162
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,344
he is a nice guy.

163
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,846
Easy, I don't know.

164
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:50,267
That's a way...
of stopping Nath getting in trouble!

165
00:05:51,018 --> 00:05:53,145
If Andrei is there, Nathália is tied.

166
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:55,147
Ramon didn't worry about him,

167
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:56,607
there was no joke.

168
00:05:56,607 --> 00:05:58,942
Ramon... he just wants to hook up.

169
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,903
Ramon didn't waste time bothering,

170
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:02,446
he just had sex!

171
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:03,947
He had sex with everybody.

172
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:06,658
Ramon's hooking up with a lot of girls!

173
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:10,037
Guys, remember she was jealous
of Ramon in front of Andrei?

174
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:12,372
It's been quite a while!

175
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,624
- She's fine!
- But...

176
00:06:13,832 --> 00:06:15,292
She's resentful, right?

177
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:16,835
Very.

178
00:06:16,835 --> 00:06:18,962
I believe you're a Scorpio, too.

179
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:21,924
I don't know, I liked Andrei.

180
00:06:21,924 --> 00:06:23,425
I don't know if I want...

181
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:30,265
God, the dream party!

182
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:33,018
Girl, the way we like to sing, girl.

183
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:35,395
Bro, look at the party they went to!

184
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,397
The way we like to put up a show!

185
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:39,066
They're in Lexa's concert!

186
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,484
Is it my concert?

187
00:06:40,484 --> 00:06:42,444
Lexa, MC Carol and Pabllo Vittar!

188
00:06:42,444 --> 00:06:44,321
I gave a concert there last year.

189
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:46,532
We go everywhere together.

190
00:06:46,532 --> 00:06:48,450
You guys are a couple, girl!

191
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:51,203
Easy, it's intense, but...

192
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,664
She knows she's intense!

193
00:06:53,664 --> 00:06:55,624
I'm that kind of friend.

194
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:57,376
That tells you, "Come on!"

195
00:06:57,626 --> 00:06:59,628
My friends are all mine.

196
00:07:00,629 --> 00:07:02,339
Are you jealous of them?

197
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:05,259
Obviously. My choreographer
started dating,

198
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:08,345
she was going to parties and being quiet,

199
00:07:08,345 --> 00:07:10,597
then she stopped going to parties.

200
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:13,642
I said, "Look, girl,
seriously... you can date,

201
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:15,769
"but don't leave your sisters behind."

202
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,521
I agree with you, but...

203
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:20,566
if my friend were like that,
baby, I'd be like this

204
00:07:20,858 --> 00:07:22,943
at the party, alone! Happy!

205
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:25,654
- So would I!
- I would resent her boyfriend.

206
00:07:25,654 --> 00:07:26,905
I'd be upset at...

207
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:29,366
A real friend wants you to be happy!

208
00:07:29,366 --> 00:07:32,202
If she's happy with someone, you'll say,

209
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:33,745
-"I'm happy for you!"
- Sure.

210
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:35,664
That's it, I'll go dancing,

211
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:38,083
but I'll hold this little grudge.

212
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:41,461
When that person breaks up,
she calls you and...

213
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,463
"I told you."

214
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,591
"Let's go out?" "No, I'm lying down."

215
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:49,720
My nickname would be Beyblade,
I would spin around everywhere.

216
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:51,346
- Beyblade!
- I like it.

217
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:53,015
I'm having fun...

218
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,185
But I didn't come here to date or...

219
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:59,104
I came here to have fun with you guys!

220
00:07:59,396 --> 00:08:02,232
But what are you gonna do about it?

221
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:04,318
How is it gonna be?

222
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:08,488
I'm gonna explain the relationship...
Explain the situation.

223
00:08:08,614 --> 00:08:12,242
I'm gonna say,
"I want us to work things out,

224
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,953
"but unfortunately,
now is not the moment."

225
00:08:14,953 --> 00:08:16,830
Nath's moved talking about that.

226
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,165
That's too harsh!

227
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:20,918
Girl, you're kissing this guy at the party

228
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:22,336
that you met 2 days ago.

229
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:25,172
I thought they were just making out!

230
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:27,674
Do you think Andrei wants that from her?

231
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,009
I don't think so!

232
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:30,010
I'll be honest...

233
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,929
What she's doing,

234
00:08:31,929 --> 00:08:34,806
she's being
emotionally responsible for him,

235
00:08:34,806 --> 00:08:35,849
which is great!

236
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:39,436
If it was the opposite,
I think she'd fall for him.

237
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,563
No, I think you can be honest...

238
00:08:41,563 --> 00:08:44,066
Nobody says
they're in love anymore, right?

239
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:46,485
No, they say they're "in love".

240
00:08:46,485 --> 00:08:48,779
I always say I'm enjoying the person,

241
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,781
I never say, "I'm in love."

242
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:52,616
- Why?
- It's cheesy!

243
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,201
It's not cheesy at all!

244
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:55,869
If you feel it, it's not!

245
00:08:55,869 --> 00:08:58,163
I don't say it exactly like this,

246
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:00,249
- but it means the same.
- Like?

247
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:01,500
"I'm head over heels...

248
00:09:02,584 --> 00:09:03,627
"for you."

249
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:06,421
"I'm head over heels
for you, you know?"

250
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,258
"I'm head over heels for you?"

251
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:10,968
"I'm into you."

252
00:09:10,968 --> 00:09:13,553
It's been a week
I've been going to your house,

253
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,139
every night, that frantic kind of thing.

254
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:18,809
Let's say I wake up,
bring you breakfast in bed,

255
00:09:18,809 --> 00:09:20,519
and say "Good morning, Carol."

256
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,230
Then you say, "Let me tell you something.

257
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:27,109
"I'm head over heels for you."
I'm gonna tell you,

258
00:09:27,109 --> 00:09:28,527
"Go see a doctor."

259
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:31,196
When you say you're head over heels...

260
00:09:31,196 --> 00:09:33,323
That's one option, it really is.

261
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,284
Guys, where I come from...

262
00:09:35,284 --> 00:09:37,661
when you say you're head over heels,

263
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:39,788
fuck, it means a lot.

264
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,040
It's like saying, "I love you."

265
00:09:45,711 --> 00:09:49,172
- He thought that was a water fountain.
- Damn, he's thirsty!

266
00:09:49,172 --> 00:09:50,590
Look.

267
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,675
Lexa 1.0.

268
00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:54,678
Now comes next version of Lexa, look!

269
00:09:54,678 --> 00:09:57,556
Lexa 2.0 now.
Drinking from a fountain!

270
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:00,600
- It's Lexa, man!
- It's me!

271
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,810
Jesus Christ, man.

272
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:04,521
Lexa doesn't make faces, he does.

273
00:10:04,646 --> 00:10:06,440
I drink calmly, right, girl?

274
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,483
The drink makes faces for her!

275
00:10:08,483 --> 00:10:09,860
She drinks a lot!

276
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:12,237
Look at Ramon, man.

277
00:10:12,237 --> 00:10:13,488
He's wasted!

278
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,991
Pabllo's already seen me like that!

279
00:10:15,991 --> 00:10:17,826
But I was like that too.

280
00:10:17,826 --> 00:10:19,661
- You don't have...
- Jeez!

281
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:22,456
Fuck, dude!

282
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:23,707
Oh, my God!

283
00:10:23,707 --> 00:10:26,293
I think that's when Ramon drank the most!

284
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:29,129
Ramon invited me to a party,
I won't go anymore.

285
00:10:29,338 --> 00:10:31,048
- What?
- I can't go out with him!

286
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:32,841
- You'll take care of him.
- No!

287
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,635
Have you ever run into Ramon
after last vacation?

288
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:38,513
No, we arranged to go
to a funk party.

289
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:40,140
The same funk party we...

290
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,100
- We go...
- Can you keep up with Ramon?

291
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,018
You can!

292
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:44,770
But he can't keep up with you.

293
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,980
I may beat him.

294
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,441
I'm very discreet at funk parties.

295
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:52,194
Wherever I go,
I'm very discreet, I'm quiet.

296
00:10:52,194 --> 00:10:55,489
To make it clear, at that party there...

297
00:10:55,697 --> 00:10:57,324
there wasn't a pandemic.

298
00:10:57,324 --> 00:11:00,327
I miss that time
we could sit next to each other!

299
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:05,874
- I don't!
- Help!

300
00:11:06,124 --> 00:11:07,751
This Nathália...

301
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:10,087
Ramon's carrying Nath, man.

302
00:11:10,087 --> 00:11:12,923
They're watching the sunrise,

303
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:16,051
- they're not doing it.
- But what do you call that?

304
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:16,968
No!

305
00:11:17,094 --> 00:11:18,220
Yeah... Trigger warning.

306
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,722
Trigger warning for the first kiss.
There's a chance.

307
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:22,933
No, that was a minor trigger warning...

308
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,393
The sunrise, look.

309
00:11:24,393 --> 00:11:27,562
Nath would mess things up
if she did that!

310
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,856
Nath would mess up or Ramon?

311
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,066
Nath!

312
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:33,068
Both of them, actually!

313
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:36,154
If I shook your hand,
we're brothers. You're with her,

314
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:38,031
she's a buddy for me, that's it!

315
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:38,949
I'm free!

316
00:11:40,033 --> 00:11:40,992
Impressive!

317
00:11:41,284 --> 00:11:43,328
Man, I didn't do anything.

318
00:11:43,954 --> 00:11:46,039
I was asleep when Ramon did that!

319
00:11:46,039 --> 00:11:47,124
Relax!

320
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:48,417
Talk to him.

321
00:11:48,417 --> 00:11:50,961
- He's pissed!
- No, he's not!

322
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:53,130
When I was gonna hug him, he...

323
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:55,841
Andrei's mad at Nath.

324
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:58,343
Andrei's mad, bro.

325
00:11:58,343 --> 00:12:00,595
Andrei went upstairs to his bedroom.

326
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,180
He doesn't have one!

327
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:04,224
The extra became the lead artist.

328
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:07,394
He's a guest who gets mad
in the host.

329
00:12:07,394 --> 00:12:08,770
At this moment,

330
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,357
I feel sorry for Ramon
because I had a flashback

331
00:12:12,357 --> 00:12:15,402
of the last vacation, of how they were.

332
00:12:16,027 --> 00:12:17,737
He and Nath were...

333
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:19,698
Andrei's sleeping on the floor!

334
00:12:19,865 --> 00:12:22,117
I said he didn't even have a bed!

335
00:12:22,451 --> 00:12:23,827
I would leave.

336
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:26,371
He has a reason to be jealous like this.

337
00:12:26,371 --> 00:12:29,124
- But nothing happened, bitch!
- Nothing!

338
00:12:29,124 --> 00:12:30,917
But he has a reason, sis.

339
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,627
Reason for what, bitch?

340
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:36,131
I'm dating you
and your ex carries you...

341
00:12:36,131 --> 00:12:37,966
It's complicated, girl!

342
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:41,011
But he has to understand
he's new on the block,

343
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,679
it had happened before...

344
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:44,973
But he was classy, he didn't argue.

345
00:12:44,973 --> 00:12:47,017
That's what I was gonna say.

346
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:49,269
He didn't say anything stupid to her,

347
00:12:49,394 --> 00:12:50,645
he went to sleep.

348
00:12:50,645 --> 00:12:51,771
He just slept!

349
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:53,398
I'd be kind of upset too,

350
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:56,067
because of the situation,
and I'd talk to her.

351
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,944
The problem with those guys

352
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,947
is that they always get mad at the women.

353
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:04,659
If I were there, I'd say,
"What's up, bro?"

354
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:08,747
But he doesn't have to talk to the guy,
he has to talk to her!

355
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:11,291
If I were Andrei, I'd talk to Ramon!

356
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,292
"What's that?"

357
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:13,960
I'd do that,

358
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,379
but I think it wouldn't bother me.

359
00:13:16,379 --> 00:13:17,839
But that bothered him!

360
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,758
They're not in a relationship!

361
00:13:19,758 --> 00:13:21,468
No one knows what will happen!

362
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:24,513
You didn't like it? Go to bed!

363
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:28,808
Remember when she argued with Ramon
because of that girl?

364
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:32,771
Andrei was in the bus,
he noticed she has feelings for him.

365
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:36,149
So, he will be upset
with his girl, his affair,

366
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:38,818
not with the guy, he doesn't matter.

367
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,904
The guy's hurt, right?

368
00:13:40,904 --> 00:13:42,447
He's falling for her!

369
00:13:42,447 --> 00:13:45,075
I think he's bothered enough
to not sleep with her,

370
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:46,159
but not to leave.

371
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,494
They'll kiss...

372
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:49,871
To sleep on the floor like that,

373
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:52,415
- that's terrible!
- They'll be cool.

374
00:13:52,415 --> 00:13:55,085
Can you tell me
why you got upset yesterday?

375
00:13:57,087 --> 00:14:00,006
I don't know. I was taking care of you...

376
00:14:01,174 --> 00:14:02,259
at the end and...

377
00:14:03,093 --> 00:14:04,135
I was drunk...

378
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:06,054
But I was asleep.

379
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:08,014
It's not my fault!

380
00:14:08,014 --> 00:14:09,057
I know!

381
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,725
But you got angry.

382
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:12,185
Yes.

383
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:15,730
Guys, can I say something?
I like that talk.

384
00:14:16,898 --> 00:14:20,318
At least he told her the truth, you know?

385
00:14:20,443 --> 00:14:22,696
-"Man, that's it..."
- I don't know!

386
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,781
He said he didn't get pissed...

387
00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:27,659
I feel like going there
and comforting him.

388
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:29,703
-"I was sad."
- He's sad!

389
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:30,954
If I were Nath...

390
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:33,957
I would talk to Andrei differently,

391
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:38,211
like, "I know you were upset because
Ramon carried me,

392
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,922
"but I didn't do anything.
I'm sorry about that."

393
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:43,091
- To put herself...
- In his shoes.

394
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:46,720
"Yes, I know you got upset. I'm sorry.

395
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,472
"I didn't do anything to you,
I was sleeping.

396
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:54,477
"So, let's keep going today? Or else
that's okay, I'm gonna go to my party..."

397
00:14:54,477 --> 00:14:55,770
That's it!

398
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:57,439
I didn't plan this...

399
00:14:57,439 --> 00:15:00,150
To be in a relationship with someone here.

400
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:04,446
It's the first time
the four of us are single...

401
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:07,699
Last vacation we were all dating...

402
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:11,828
That doesn't mean
we won't see each other again!

403
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,830
I liked the talk!

404
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:17,417
Please, emotional responsibility!

405
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,419
- Sit and talk!
- He's sad!

406
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:23,840
I think she could have apologized
for the situation, you know?

407
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:25,508
Imagine if you were him.

408
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:27,719
But, girl, it's really not her fault.

409
00:15:27,719 --> 00:15:29,262
No need to apologize.

410
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,223
He really got upset,
he said, "I'm gonna pack."

411
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:35,810
I said she could have apologized
for the situation!

412
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,103
Imagine you...

413
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,855
She didn't do anything!

414
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:42,317
The thing is, he had
a reason to be upset, you know?

415
00:15:42,317 --> 00:15:45,320
She thinks
she could have done that differently.

416
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:49,699
She was right, she was straight, you know?

417
00:15:49,699 --> 00:15:53,119
If he got upset, it's not her fault!

418
00:15:53,119 --> 00:15:55,664
And I think she was influenced by Anna.

419
00:15:55,664 --> 00:15:56,706
Yes...

420
00:15:56,706 --> 00:15:59,125
Now you understand that everything,

421
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,379
all fights, apart from Luan and Bia,

422
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:06,508
wouldn't have existed
if they had that kind of talk.

423
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:08,134
- That's it!
- Yes.

424
00:16:13,056 --> 00:16:16,518
I don't wanna see you
hooking up with another guy.

425
00:16:19,354 --> 00:16:22,357
That's not gonna happen.
It'd never have happened.

426
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:26,403
I just didn't want to put a label on it.

427
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,321
- But I've never...
- We don't...

428
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:31,074
...left home wanting
to hook up with a guy.

429
00:16:32,867 --> 00:16:34,452
We don't need anything else.

430
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:37,288
We have to be partners.

431
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:38,623
I'm gonna cry!

432
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,584
Kimberly.

433
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:42,961
Look at her joy.

434
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,508
Oh, what a good kiss.

435
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,593
Oh, what a big tongue!

436
00:16:52,262 --> 00:16:55,390
It's been a while since
I've felt a tongue.

437
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,685
Carol, are you happy they're together?

438
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,479
Little Pucca doesn't even comment!

439
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:05,024
Oh, my God!

440
00:17:11,531 --> 00:17:13,908
Another friend of hers!

441
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:17,162
Ítalo is dangerous.

442
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:21,750
Is that a kiss?

443
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,794
It's somebody she makes out with.
Look at Tay's face!

444
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:27,297
Look at Renatinho, "Ouch."

445
00:17:28,965 --> 00:17:33,011
How's Renatinho? Because the guy
who just arrived is real handsome.

446
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,764
This is my guy from Rio.

447
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:38,016
Ítalo, Tay.

448
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:39,851
Bro, hit pause!

449
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,436
"This is my guy from Rio."

450
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:44,439
Do you remember
when Renatinho got in the house,

451
00:17:44,439 --> 00:17:48,026
"Aren't you the guy
that hooked up with Milena?"

452
00:17:48,026 --> 00:17:49,152
That's Milena!

453
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,361
What?

454
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:51,613
Don't you remember?

455
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:54,240
- Of course I do!
- That's Milena.

456
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,950
That's Milena!

457
00:17:55,950 --> 00:17:58,161
Let me introduce. Nathália, Renato.

458
00:17:58,161 --> 00:17:59,788
- Renato.
- Nice to meet you.

459
00:18:01,289 --> 00:18:03,082
Guys, is it Milena's guy?

460
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,168
Hey, man. Jeez, dude.

461
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:07,796
How are you? I'm fine.

462
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:09,839
- Are you cool?
- I'm fine.

463
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:12,175
But when Anna talked about him,

464
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:15,470
it was like the relationship
wasn't that good.

465
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:16,429
Yes!

466
00:18:16,429 --> 00:18:19,015
Anna hooked up with her friend's guy...

467
00:18:19,015 --> 00:18:20,725
she's with the guy from Rio.

468
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:21,726
Yes...

469
00:18:21,893 --> 00:18:23,812
Guys, we're going camping...

470
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,688
Let's go camping tomorrow!

471
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:27,565
Camping!

472
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:34,781
- Look at Nath.
- Have you ever gone camping?

473
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,617
I went camping in the Amazon forest once.

474
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:40,787
I just found out I was there
two days after.

475
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,873
Then I started to cry
because I remembered Anaconda.

476
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,584
I never went camping.

477
00:18:46,584 --> 00:18:49,546
But I wouldn't sleep well, and I'm a big,

478
00:18:49,546 --> 00:18:51,214
hot girl!

479
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:52,340
What's that?

480
00:18:52,340 --> 00:18:53,299
I'm a big girl!

481
00:18:59,264 --> 00:19:01,057
What happened?

482
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:03,476
Oh, let her speak!

483
00:19:03,476 --> 00:19:06,145
Please, have you ever gone camping?

484
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,480
I haven't!

485
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:10,108
I was gonna ask you
to set up a tent with me,

486
00:19:10,108 --> 00:19:11,609
but you don't like it!

487
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,820
I was gonna say something, but I'm...

488
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,071
I'm gonna be quiet.

489
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:16,573
Camping at the beach?

490
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:17,991
Never!

491
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:19,576
It's very good!

492
00:19:19,576 --> 00:19:22,662
Fuck! He's my brother from Rio.
He's my fuck buddy!

493
00:19:22,662 --> 00:19:25,915
Bro, relax. Look, enjoy.

494
00:19:25,915 --> 00:19:26,958
Please!

495
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:29,460
Did you hear her saying
he's her fuck buddy?

496
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,170
Do you have many FBs?

497
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,922
I don't have time for this.

498
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:34,048
I travel a lot!

499
00:19:34,048 --> 00:19:36,259
That has nothing to do with it.

500
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,136
- I don't have a fuck buddy!
- No?

501
00:19:38,136 --> 00:19:40,388
I don't spent much time in one place.

502
00:19:40,388 --> 00:19:43,725
You can have one in São Paulo,
when you are here...

503
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,310
She has people to call...

504
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,394
"This is FB."

505
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,104
No, it's not!

506
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,939
They change all the time!

507
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:52,525
My thing is, a lot of turnover.

508
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,360
I live in Uberlândia...

509
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,238
I don't hook up with anybody there because

510
00:19:57,238 --> 00:19:58,781
I did them all!

511
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:00,575
Love, whore's love

512
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:02,243
Whore's love

513
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,495
- That's it!
- What about you, Carol?

514
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,205
I don't have that,

515
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,833
but there are some guys I hooked up with

516
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,627
and I know the sex is good...

517
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:13,463
Sometimes I stop by and...

518
00:20:13,463 --> 00:20:15,256
"Hey, what about that day?"

519
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:17,508
So, we laugh, talk, and...

520
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:20,094
That's a fuck buddy.
Do you have many FBs?

521
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:21,054
FB!

522
00:20:21,054 --> 00:20:22,305
Fuck buddy. I get it.

523
00:20:23,473 --> 00:20:26,643
There's that person, right?
In another state,

524
00:20:26,643 --> 00:20:30,104
that you have a nice vibe with...

525
00:20:30,355 --> 00:20:31,230
John?

526
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,566
Man, I do, but it's...

527
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,402
I have all kinds of fuck buddies.

528
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,863
John has objects which are their friends.

529
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:41,824
Everything can be sexual for him.

530
00:20:41,824 --> 00:20:44,577
I have FBs, BBs...

531
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,704
- What's a BB?
- Booty buddy.

532
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,623
Booty buddy?

533
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:50,375
Fuck!

534
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,960
Yeah, I'm jealous.

535
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:53,169
Friends with benefits.

536
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:57,465
Sometimes I don't care
seeing him with other girls,

537
00:20:57,882 --> 00:20:59,217
but sometimes I do.

538
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,094
Yeah, right!

539
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:02,428
Meaning...

540
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:04,847
Look!

541
00:21:04,847 --> 00:21:06,557
I'm gonna say something!

542
00:21:06,557 --> 00:21:07,558
Hit pause!

543
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:12,021
If there's someone I like
at this moment, it's Nathália.

544
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:14,857
Nathália keeps everybody at bay.

545
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:16,025
She's unbearable.

546
00:21:16,025 --> 00:21:17,318
She's closed!

547
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:19,612
But when she's honest, she's awesome!

548
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,865
Like, "I like the guy,
but I can't explain it,

549
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:24,659
-"I'm jealous..."
- She's honest!

550
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:25,660
I like that!

551
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:28,913
She's not being honest
saying she doesn't mind...

552
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:32,542
"I don't, but I do, and I wanna throw
my drink at the girl."

553
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:34,544
Titto, do you think she was honest?

554
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:36,754
She doesn't know what she's talking about.

555
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:37,839
She did like Anna.

556
00:21:37,839 --> 00:21:41,467
She said she didn't mind,
but seeing Renatinho having sex...

557
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:45,221
That's it! Nobody is totally detached
not to give a shit!

558
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,974
You can't be 100 percent detached!

559
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:50,101
What they have is chemistry.

560
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:52,061
They have that attraction...

561
00:21:52,061 --> 00:21:53,855
That's a chill of arousal.

562
00:21:53,855 --> 00:21:54,897
Is that it?

563
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:56,482
- I think so!
- That's delicious.

564
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:57,567
Ouch!

565
00:21:57,567 --> 00:21:59,444
Let's go to the sex room?

566
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:03,114
There's gonna be a gangbang.

567
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:04,615
The three of them?

568
00:22:04,615 --> 00:22:06,993
Yes! That's gonna happen...

569
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:08,244
A threesome.

570
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:09,746
A homage?

571
00:22:09,871 --> 00:22:11,497
Oh, my God!

572
00:22:12,832 --> 00:22:14,375
Homage à trois.

573
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:15,501
I'm shocked!

574
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:19,088
Ménage. Oh, my God!

575
00:22:19,088 --> 00:22:21,424
Fuck, he's really a friend!

576
00:22:23,968 --> 00:22:25,261
Let me get this.

577
00:22:25,261 --> 00:22:27,430
Milena went to brush her teeth?

578
00:22:27,638 --> 00:22:31,267
No, she went to pop a pimple and left!

579
00:22:31,267 --> 00:22:32,643
Milena was naked?

580
00:22:32,643 --> 00:22:34,353
I think she was naked.

581
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,147
Guys, it happened!

582
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:37,774
There was a real ménage.

583
00:22:37,774 --> 00:22:40,526
I'd brush my teeth before having sex.

584
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:42,904
But when Anna saw Milena at that party,

585
00:22:42,904 --> 00:22:44,655
she said, "My best friend!"

586
00:22:45,406 --> 00:22:46,657
Yes!

587
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:48,743
A friend you have sex with?

588
00:22:48,743 --> 00:22:49,786
Yes, like us.

589
00:22:49,952 --> 00:22:52,413
But I didn't get one thing,

590
00:22:52,413 --> 00:22:55,458
Renatinho was left behind,
he didn't try anything...

591
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:57,919
Renatinho and Anna are tied!

592
00:22:58,044 --> 00:22:59,879
She talked about Milena...

593
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:02,465
No, it was Brazil versus Germany!

594
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:04,717
Some people have many things...

595
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:07,678
Renatinho held his dick.
Held his dick!

596
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:11,599
Let me say,
the competition between them is ruthless.

597
00:23:11,599 --> 00:23:13,643
I don't know who hooked up more!

598
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:21,234
Did you hear that?

599
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:25,363
If Renatinho leaves today,
he lived as if it were two seasons.

600
00:23:25,363 --> 00:23:29,408
I wonder if he's going back to Nikiti,
will you meet him, Carol?

601
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:31,369
- Renatinho?
- No, I'm cool!

602
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:33,704
Have you ever done that, girl?

603
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:36,457
- What?
- Challenged a short man?

604
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:37,750
"What do you want?"

605
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,461
Girl, I challenge ugly men.
Sometimes I do it!

606
00:23:40,753 --> 00:23:42,588
I look at the ugly guy and say,

607
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:44,465
"I'll do it to feel pretty!"

608
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:45,800
Short men. I go for it.

609
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,552
Jerry, how tall are you?

610
00:23:47,552 --> 00:23:49,804
I'm 5' 9".

611
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:52,974
How would you hit on Pabllo?
Pabllo, stand up, please.

612
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:56,769
But make that voice
so she'll shake those big legs, okay?

613
00:23:56,769 --> 00:23:59,981
- Look at those quads, guys.
- The difference is big.

614
00:24:00,106 --> 00:24:02,108
She's not bullshit.

615
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:04,652
Let's see it, hear it, hear it.

616
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,696
- What's up, baby?
- Hi.

617
00:24:10,241 --> 00:24:11,909
Oh, the famous big ass.

618
00:24:11,909 --> 00:24:13,077
Fuck!

619
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,371
He didn't say anything!

620
00:24:15,371 --> 00:24:17,707
Girl, hear Jerry's voice!

621
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,500
That's the 4:00 in the morning!

622
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,252
That's it!

623
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:25,006
Jerry, did you think it was difficult?

624
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:27,425
Life's simpler than we imagined!

625
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:29,218
Let's have a hot dog?

626
00:24:29,218 --> 00:24:30,303
A hot dog!

627
00:24:33,181 --> 00:24:34,724
Anna, look.

628
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:37,143
She tripped, I didn't do anything!

629
00:24:37,143 --> 00:24:39,520
Okay. She really tripped.

630
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:41,355
I took two guys there,

631
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:44,108
- nobody touched me.
- Is it my fault?

632
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,027
You gave the opportunity.

633
00:24:46,027 --> 00:24:48,070
Stop pretending is not your fault!

634
00:24:48,070 --> 00:24:51,490
Anna, I said,
"Let's enjoy the hot dog."

635
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,409
And she did that.

636
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:55,828
Look how cynical he is!

637
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:58,372
Bro, look how cynical he is. Oh, my God!

638
00:24:58,581 --> 00:25:00,166
Look at that cynical guy!

639
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:03,502
Girl, I'd send him back to his hotel

640
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:06,380
and say, "I'm gonna stay at the beach.

641
00:25:06,380 --> 00:25:07,423
"Stay away!"

642
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,425
"Your vacation is over!"

643
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,052
I think, in my opinion,

644
00:25:11,052 --> 00:25:14,055
that girl didn't know about anything!

645
00:25:14,055 --> 00:25:16,599
No, it's his fault!

646
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:19,477
She said, "Let's go."
And held his arm.

647
00:25:19,477 --> 00:25:23,231
She was just holding his arm...
just because!

648
00:25:23,231 --> 00:25:24,440
Yes!

649
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:26,484
She didn't know he was with Anna!

650
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:28,319
And I think Anna is...

651
00:25:28,319 --> 00:25:29,820
It's not the girl's fault!

652
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,907
She shouldn't know about anything,
but what about him?

653
00:25:32,907 --> 00:25:34,158
Anna's overreacting!

654
00:25:34,158 --> 00:25:35,493
He's a cynic.

655
00:25:35,493 --> 00:25:36,577
Everybody agreed!

656
00:25:36,577 --> 00:25:39,372
But she says she's a free girl,

657
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:41,916
a free girl all the time and so on.

658
00:25:41,916 --> 00:25:43,501
He made a scene first.

659
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:44,627
Exactly!

660
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:47,129
He's mad 'cause
she didn't let him do that stuff.

661
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:51,050
He said he liked her a lot
in her ear!

662
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:54,512
I think he could've avoided that,

663
00:25:55,554 --> 00:25:56,681
got it?

664
00:25:56,681 --> 00:25:59,642
Because, man, you don't need to say that.

665
00:25:59,642 --> 00:26:03,354
I can offer you a glass of water
and suggest a lot of things.

666
00:26:03,688 --> 00:26:06,357
I can flirt with you
drinking a glass of water.

667
00:26:06,357 --> 00:26:08,734
Seduce me by offering me a glass of water.

668
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:10,611
I won't say anything.

669
00:26:10,611 --> 00:26:12,071
I'll drink the water.

670
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,531
Just drink and offer me.

671
00:26:15,783 --> 00:26:16,867
What the hell?

672
00:26:16,867 --> 00:26:19,036
Carol, take it. Take my wallet.

673
00:26:22,081 --> 00:26:23,457
What does that mean?

674
00:26:23,457 --> 00:26:27,461
The glass was salty, they washed it...

675
00:26:27,795 --> 00:26:30,881
It means I wanna drink something
that's not this water.

676
00:26:32,508 --> 00:26:33,342
Jeez!

677
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:34,719
Where's her milk?

678
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:36,262
Hey, woman, hey!

679
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,848
It'd be way easier if you enjoyed with us!

680
00:26:38,848 --> 00:26:39,890
We are with you!

681
00:26:40,016 --> 00:26:40,933
With us!

682
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:42,768
We took you in!

683
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,478
Okay, fine!

684
00:26:44,478 --> 00:26:45,438
Look...

685
00:26:45,438 --> 00:26:46,981
That's it...

686
00:26:46,981 --> 00:26:48,649
Now it's Renatinho's fault.

687
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:50,568
Now it is Renatinho's fault!

688
00:26:50,568 --> 00:26:51,736
Nonsense!

689
00:26:51,736 --> 00:26:53,571
That's nonsense!

690
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:55,865
He can bring a girl. She's already...

691
00:26:55,865 --> 00:26:57,658
He could bring a girl!

692
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:59,744
Thanks, Anna, for this!

693
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:01,746
Anna and Ítalo!

694
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:02,788
Come, Mu.

695
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:04,832
Look at that!

696
00:27:06,751 --> 00:27:08,252
Look at the size of it.

697
00:27:10,087 --> 00:27:11,714
Renato's last day!

698
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:13,507
That's beautiful!

699
00:27:14,050 --> 00:27:15,092
That's it, bro!

700
00:27:15,092 --> 00:27:16,844
Always.

701
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:18,220
That's it, guys.

702
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:20,389
There's no better place to say goodbye.

703
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,767
This place is nice for camping!

704
00:27:22,767 --> 00:27:25,227
It's bad to start missing people!

705
00:27:25,227 --> 00:27:28,481
When there's one day left,
you always feel bad!

706
00:27:28,814 --> 00:27:31,317
Guys, the last episode is coming!

707
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:32,777
I'm feeling something.

708
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:35,946
Look who's coming.

709
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:40,034
Fuck!

710
00:27:40,242 --> 00:27:42,328
She really woke up, right?

711
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:45,081
Look at Renatinho's joy
because Anna came back.

712
00:27:45,081 --> 00:27:46,707
He's staring at her!

713
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:49,085
Kiss? No, get out of here!

714
00:27:49,085 --> 00:27:50,169
That's a mistake.

715
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,295
Kiss?

716
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:54,173
I think this is
