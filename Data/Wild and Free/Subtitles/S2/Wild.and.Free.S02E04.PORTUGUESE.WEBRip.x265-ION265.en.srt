WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS 2
THE REVIEW

2
00:00:07,174 --> 00:00:08,718
You guys aren't anxious?

3
00:00:08,718 --> 00:00:09,760
I'm anxious.

4
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,470
Pretend we're at a party.

5
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:16,600
That big beat, right?

6
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:19,186
This week took some time.

7
00:00:19,562 --> 00:00:20,938
Jerry's gonna sit down.

8
00:00:23,149 --> 00:00:25,276
Jerrynho is hotter each day.

9
00:00:25,401 --> 00:00:26,360
Very cool.

10
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:29,572
- Damn, you're all dressed up today.
- Yes!

11
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:31,115
Oh, girl! Episode two.

12
00:00:31,282 --> 00:00:32,450
Where were you?

13
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,659
Fashion week.

14
00:00:34,702 --> 00:00:36,245
In my bedroom.

15
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:39,665
We are honoring last week's party.

16
00:00:39,665 --> 00:00:42,793
I said she's dressed up, not you.
Get over yourself.

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,587
I'm not talking to you.

18
00:00:44,587 --> 00:00:46,547
Get over yourself.

19
00:00:46,714 --> 00:00:48,215
I'll send our chat history.

20
00:00:48,382 --> 00:00:50,176
Don't do it.

21
00:00:50,176 --> 00:00:51,427
I'm exposed!

22
00:00:51,427 --> 00:00:53,512
I want to see episode two now.

23
00:00:53,512 --> 00:00:58,058
Is everybody ready? Because episode one
was nerve-racking, right?

24
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:00,186
It started very well.

25
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:06,484
Luan expressed his feelings to Bia.
They fought, got together and had sex.

26
00:01:06,484 --> 00:01:10,988
He also apologized
for doing a lot of things last...

27
00:01:10,988 --> 00:01:13,115
- Making up...
- Love vows.

28
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:14,450
...vacation.

29
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:19,330
I'm dying to know what happened
to Murilo and Tay.

30
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,665
Because they started like that,
and now, what?

31
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:24,794
Do you think they can fix this?
The episode ended

32
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:28,714
with Murilo hooking up with a girl
in front of Tay. Will she forgive him?

33
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:34,470
A second pair of eyes never hurts.
Hashtag call me, and I'll come.

34
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,224
She hooked up with a guy too.
She just dismissed him.

35
00:01:38,224 --> 00:01:41,477
She just hooked up with that guy
to tease him, guys.

36
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:43,729
No, girl, no!

37
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:46,524
He hooked up with that girl to tease her!

38
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:49,777
You can love one,
but feel attracted to others.

39
00:01:49,777 --> 00:01:52,696
You know when you're determined
to forget a person?

40
00:01:52,696 --> 00:01:56,075
- She might go back to him.
- Yes, right, but...

41
00:01:56,075 --> 00:02:00,621
In a relationship, the point is
finding somebody worth waiting for.

42
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:02,456
- No!
- Obviously!

43
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,542
Relationships are based on this.

44
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:06,836
I won't wait, I'm a whore.

45
00:02:08,379 --> 00:02:10,130
Let's watch. Hit play.

46
00:02:13,175 --> 00:02:15,553
I LOVE YOU

47
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,766
Did you see Murilo's picture?

48
00:02:20,766 --> 00:02:22,226
Look!

49
00:02:23,853 --> 00:02:26,856
Tay woke up,
Murilo got out of the bathroom...

50
00:02:27,815 --> 00:02:30,359
- Murilo, are you busy in the kitchen?
- Yes.

51
00:02:31,819 --> 00:02:34,446
"Are you busy?" "I am." Take that.

52
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:37,408
I hate people who hold grudges
when they drink.

53
00:02:37,408 --> 00:02:41,287
Bitch, really? Do you need
to be that rude, Murilo?

54
00:02:44,874 --> 00:02:47,960
I'm cool, I woke up great this morning.

55
00:02:48,252 --> 00:02:50,671
You had sex... All relaxed.

56
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:52,214
Oh, yummy!

57
00:02:53,716 --> 00:02:56,510
- You nailed it.
- Not saying anything...

58
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,721
That's it.

59
00:02:59,597 --> 00:03:01,640
She said you were teasing her.

60
00:03:01,765 --> 00:03:06,228
He's playing the cool guy. Do you think
he's really cool with that or not?

61
00:03:06,437 --> 00:03:08,355
We don't know if he's cool...

62
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:12,651
Looks like he's pretending.
Do you believe he's cool with that?

63
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:14,904
- I think he's pretending.
- Me too.

64
00:03:15,070 --> 00:03:17,489
If he were,
he wouldn't have brought that up.

65
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:21,118
You know when you tell someone
you never think about him?

66
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,037
Yeah, that's exactly it.

67
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:27,041
You know when the person
wants to show they're cool and say,

68
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:31,420
"Fuck, did you see that mouth I kissed?"
Telling friends to hit on her...

69
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,757
This is a boy thing.
Gay people don't act like this.

70
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:38,969
I don't say, "Hey, did you see
I kissed..." Oh, cut it out.

71
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,679
I do it.

72
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:41,972
"That mouth."

73
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,809
Girl, after what happened yesterday,

74
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:49,021
how are you and Murilo?

75
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:50,981
What are you gonna do?

76
00:03:51,482 --> 00:03:57,154
There's no feelings involved in kissing,
but sharing the energy of sex is hard.

77
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:58,864
It's hypocrisy.

78
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,574
I'm gonna go with you.

79
00:04:01,033 --> 00:04:02,701
There are both sides.

80
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:05,871
On the same bed? That's fucked up.

81
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:07,748
She hooked up with another guy.

82
00:04:07,998 --> 00:04:10,292
But not in the same house.

83
00:04:10,292 --> 00:04:15,756
I think "hooking up"
and "having sex" is the same thing.

84
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:20,094
- I think sex is a plus.
- But, for example, you like the boy...

85
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:23,305
One thing is he doing it,
another is you seeing it.

86
00:04:23,555 --> 00:04:25,975
Now, get this. To begin with,

87
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,436
they weren't together. Right?

88
00:04:29,436 --> 00:04:32,189
It doesn't matter
if it was on their bed...

89
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,776
Since they had a history,
there must be respect.

90
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,362
For me, this would be over.

91
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:40,447
If I break up with a guy,

92
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,700
I'm an artist, I...

93
00:04:44,535 --> 00:04:46,662
Honey, I'm a singer!

94
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:49,373
I'm an exception.

95
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,876
Yeah. I'm an artist.
Artists can do anything.

96
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:55,254
They can dye their hair.

97
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:59,008
If I know, like, I'm not with him...

98
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:04,638
A lot of situations have happened, right?
I break up with him and I messed up...

99
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:05,889
Can I ask you?

100
00:05:07,182 --> 00:05:10,561
Explain this artist's poetic license
to me... Wait, artist,

101
00:05:10,978 --> 00:05:13,772
as in a person who works with art, right?

102
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:16,942
I need, Titto. I need to do these things.

103
00:05:16,942 --> 00:05:18,569
- What things?
- Things?

104
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:22,114
From time to time,
you have to go wild, so there's music!

105
00:05:22,573 --> 00:05:24,783
- Or else, there's no...
- Content?

106
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,201
Yes! There's no content.

107
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:30,122
So, that's it? So, you have to fuck up
to write music?

108
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:31,957
- Yes!
- What about you, Pabllo?

109
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:35,294
For starters, I don't even date.

110
00:05:35,544 --> 00:05:37,880
But if you have something more serious...

111
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,132
A crush you see twice.

112
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:43,719
I had, but I realized
that I don't belong to this world.

113
00:05:44,303 --> 00:05:47,848
I live on the edge,
I'm more like Carol from Niterói.

114
00:05:48,015 --> 00:05:50,059
I need to live crazy moments.

115
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,101
You do?

116
00:05:53,312 --> 00:05:54,146
- Yeah.
- Okay!

117
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:56,774
Let's see their crazy moments.

118
00:05:59,902 --> 00:06:02,654
I have trigger warnings
seeing those beaches.

119
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:05,407
I love it!

120
00:06:07,493 --> 00:06:10,704
I loved seeing the girls
working their asses off.

121
00:06:10,829 --> 00:06:13,582
"Sweetie, this is not a spa",
mom used to say.

122
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:16,293
You have to work, and enjoy it.

123
00:06:16,293 --> 00:06:17,753
Working what, Pabllo?

124
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,588
Their 'bigooties".

125
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:23,217
- What's that?
- Big plus booties, 'bigooties'.

126
00:06:26,053 --> 00:06:27,137
Very good!

127
00:06:27,429 --> 00:06:28,430
Big booty.

128
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,100
I thought they did a great job.

129
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:35,062
I think the bar owner, your sugar daddy,

130
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:36,772
was rough on them.

131
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:40,234
Because they did their best. Seriously.

132
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,028
Carol, the manager likes a good funk?

133
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:46,240
Guys, stop that, I just...

134
00:06:46,615 --> 00:06:49,076
- I said I like serious men...
- With a job.

135
00:06:49,493 --> 00:06:53,247
Yeah, but not that I wanted him, got it?

136
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:56,834
You said good things about him.
You said you had a crush on him.

137
00:06:56,834 --> 00:06:58,085
I don't remember.

138
00:06:58,085 --> 00:06:59,336
Right! Did you see it?

139
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:02,756
I'm Ricardo, manager of the bar
where you're going to work.

140
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,675
Jeez, he's serious!

141
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:08,887
You like serious men like him, right?

142
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,265
Would you take a ride on his boat?

143
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,975
Wouldn't you hook up with him?

144
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:17,187
I'm from the favela, man,
I was born there.

145
00:07:17,187 --> 00:07:19,523
If he invited me on his boat, I'd go!

146
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:21,567
But would you hook up with him?

147
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:24,611
- Would you, Carol?
- He's older.

148
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,613
I like men my age.

149
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,241
I love hooking up
with older men, you know?

150
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,535
You have to speak loud!

151
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,453
Pabllo?

152
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,415
As long as he's a man, he's my type!

153
00:07:36,415 --> 00:07:39,293
If he's alive, you're good to go, right?

154
00:07:39,293 --> 00:07:41,503
Oh, baby, if we hook up...

155
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:42,963
You do hook up with girls.

156
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:44,673
- Well...
- Don't deny it.

157
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,550
Whatever comes my way.

158
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,677
I think we have to be...

159
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,972
What about you, Jerry? How old are you?

160
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,932
I'm 26.

161
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:55,976
What's the average age for you?

162
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:58,020
Bro, it's 18...

163
00:07:58,228 --> 00:08:00,689
- Eighteen?
- I'd go for an eighteen-year-old.

164
00:08:00,689 --> 00:08:02,524
Hello! I'm eighteen-and-a-half.

165
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:04,610
- Eighteen?
- Yes, my ex...

166
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:06,361
was 18 last year.

167
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:07,654
My boy was 50.

168
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:10,824
He had trouble getting it up,

169
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,577
- but everything went well.
- How old are you?

170
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:14,870
- I'm 26.
- Pabllo?

171
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:15,913
I'm 25.

172
00:08:15,913 --> 00:08:18,373
Bro, I'm much older than everybody here?

173
00:08:18,373 --> 00:08:21,043
I have nothing against your age, okay?

174
00:08:21,043 --> 00:08:22,753
I'm here in case you want me.

175
00:08:22,753 --> 00:08:24,755
I have nothing against your age.

176
00:08:25,047 --> 00:08:26,965
I have nothing against your age.

177
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,218
Look, there's a series going on!

178
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:37,184
Oh, my God! It's Vanessinha!
That chick worked with me!

179
00:08:38,936 --> 00:08:40,687
Is Vanessinha good, girl?

180
00:08:40,687 --> 00:08:43,732
- Yes!
- But she falls for Ramon's sweet talk?

181
00:08:43,732 --> 00:08:45,275
She's very smart.

182
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:49,196
- Is that Vanessa?
- Is that Vanessa?

183
00:08:49,571 --> 00:08:51,490
That's Vanessa!

184
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,492
Vanessa's arrived, honey.

185
00:08:55,994 --> 00:08:57,537
Look. The crying.

186
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:01,541
Don't let her make you lose your mind.
Don't lose it in front of her.

187
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,126
Anna!

188
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,045
- Who's that coach?
- Anna!

189
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:06,797
It's not Anna!

190
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:09,675
- But she's a player, you know?
- Dive in.

191
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:11,718
What's happening?

192
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:14,388
Honey!

193
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:16,682
Honey, you've just got in the game.

194
00:09:17,808 --> 00:09:19,810
- Hit pause!
- This is called...

195
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:20,727
That's booze!

196
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:25,607
I love it! He was expecting Tay to make
a scene about that sex event.

197
00:09:25,774 --> 00:09:28,360
But she was absolute
and it's bothering him.

198
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:29,861
Like, she doesn't care.

199
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,532
But I didn't get that part
about her being not sure.

200
00:09:33,532 --> 00:09:36,451
- I think that's on him!
- She's sure!

201
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:40,122
She was an icon.
But that made him uncomfortable.

202
00:09:40,122 --> 00:09:45,168
If you want psychological counseling,
help, advice...

203
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:50,090
I charge... Three grand an hour.

204
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:52,676
- Three grand?
- I solve any problem.

205
00:09:52,968 --> 00:09:54,011
Anything.

206
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:57,055
Oh, but don't put her
in the house after, okay?

207
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:58,598
Tell her to chill.

208
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,350
They had to put you seated...

209
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,228
on a pillow, the guru of the house.

210
00:10:03,228 --> 00:10:06,189
I solve... I solve anything,
I read hands...

211
00:10:06,189 --> 00:10:08,191
I didn't get why he was crying.

212
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,569
I don't get this situation. At all.

213
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:12,988
He likes her, they'll be together...

214
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:16,742
He had sex...
Actually, he wouldn't do that.

215
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:19,661
He's annoyed
because Tay didn't do anything.

216
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:23,665
He doesn't get he's the one playing games,

217
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,543
he's getting a taste of his own medicine.

218
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:29,129
- Yes.
- I like Murilo a lot.

219
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,714
I love drama.

220
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:33,675
I'm a Pisces, but I'm not that dramatic.

221
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,844
Relationships must have this drama.

222
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:37,596
I don't understand...

223
00:10:37,596 --> 00:10:40,265
Girl, if there's no drama, it's not good.

224
00:10:40,265 --> 00:10:42,225
Both have to cry!

225
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:45,520
I think he's being noble.
He's apologized to Anna...

226
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,230
He's getting it off his chest.

227
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:49,900
He's expressing his feelings, that's cool.

228
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:51,651
But he had to do that to Tay.

229
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:54,196
I didn't get it when he said "prick"...

230
00:10:54,196 --> 00:10:56,365
But he had to do that to Tay.

231
00:10:56,365 --> 00:10:58,158
Maybe not yet...

232
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,285
He's blaming Tay!

233
00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:02,871
He's crying because he likes her!

234
00:11:02,871 --> 00:11:05,707
Tay is playing games?
Who had sex with the girl?

235
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:08,502
I don't think he's playing,
I think he's sorry.

236
00:11:08,502 --> 00:11:09,669
And this is good.

237
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:11,129
Good for him.

238
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,799
Why doesn't he tell her?

239
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:17,052
I think he's crying because
when we use our temple...

240
00:11:17,052 --> 00:11:18,303
Tears of arousal.

241
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,972
...our body, in a wrong way,

242
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,891
- we suffer.
- She's a minister!

243
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:25,894
I deserve this, holy shit.

244
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:28,980
Go preach away from here.

245
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,525
Do you think he's crying
because he's sorry or...

246
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:33,527
I think he wants her.

247
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:37,572
I've been there. I liked a person
and had sex with another.

248
00:11:37,572 --> 00:11:41,785
The thing ended,
and I was disgusted with myself, you know?

249
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,705
This is called moral hangover.

250
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:50,502
I think he's crazy about her
and doesn't know how to approach her...

251
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:53,004
Do you think he's crying...

252
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:56,800
because he's sorry or because
she doesn't want him anymore?

253
00:11:57,134 --> 00:11:59,386
He's seeing... That's it.

254
00:12:00,095 --> 00:12:02,806
He's afraid she doesn't want him anymore.

255
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:04,391
Yeah.

256
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,393
By the way she's acting.

257
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:08,019
If she were your friend?

258
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:11,148
If I were with Titto knowing
he's a player?

259
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:13,859
Forgiveness and little forgiveness.

260
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:15,360
Twenty-two.

261
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:18,989
- Titto.
- So, I support you.

262
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,033
Suffer for this? Oh, for God's sake.

263
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,495
- We're fancy, huh?
- Let's go!

264
00:12:25,495 --> 00:12:26,788
I love boats.

265
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,248
Have you been in one?

266
00:12:28,248 --> 00:12:29,791
No, only in vans.

267
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:32,335
And boats?

268
00:12:32,836 --> 00:12:33,670
Girl...

269
00:12:33,670 --> 00:12:36,965
There's a kombi which goes up Vidigal.
If it talked...

270
00:12:36,965 --> 00:12:40,218
I was never able to,
because I wasn't rich. Now, I am...

271
00:12:42,012 --> 00:12:44,514
working here,
lifetime contract with Amazon.

272
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:47,517
- Now you're getting a boat?
- Yes!

273
00:12:47,809 --> 00:12:50,395
Yes, I'm waiting till quarantine is over.

274
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:53,857
Look!

275
00:12:53,857 --> 00:12:56,234
Pause!

276
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:58,153
Nobody standing on the board.

277
00:12:58,153 --> 00:13:00,655
I think this sex modality is curious.

278
00:13:00,655 --> 00:13:02,491
No, guys, really?

279
00:13:02,491 --> 00:13:04,493
Something happened on that board?

280
00:13:05,243 --> 00:13:07,287
It's hard to keep your balance.

281
00:13:09,122 --> 00:13:12,334
- Love balances everything.
- He's cute!

282
00:13:12,501 --> 00:13:14,336
Pabllo falls in love easily.

283
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,755
He knows the way things are here, baby.

284
00:13:16,755 --> 00:13:20,550
What was the most unusual place
you guys had sex?

285
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:24,513
I'm a very normal person,
I like comfort, I like beds, you know?

286
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:26,097
Girl...

287
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:29,267
- One unusual place, say it.
- Yeah, I'm getting...

288
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:30,310
Unusual!

289
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:35,524
The most unusual
was at an apartment's balcony.

290
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:38,443
A very open balcony!

291
00:13:38,443 --> 00:13:42,113
- Fancy.
- Very fancy, I'm fancy, très magnifique.

292
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:43,406
Hardcore fancy.

293
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,367
Jerry, your place?

294
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:46,910
Get you in the alley

295
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:49,996
In the alley, you won't escape.

296
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:51,039
Alley!

297
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:54,209
I was very young,
it was 2:00 in the morning...

298
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:56,294
Looked, smiled, sex.

299
00:13:56,294 --> 00:13:58,922
...at a party... My mom's friend's party.

300
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:03,885
Mrs. Rosemare always throwing
the best parties.

301
00:14:03,885 --> 00:14:06,054
And there was no place...

302
00:14:06,054 --> 00:14:08,223
I'm going there on Christmas.

303
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:11,309
- And you, Carol?
- I can't tell.

304
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,353
Where was it? Tell us!

305
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:15,313
You were tied?

306
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,108
Guys...

307
00:14:18,108 --> 00:14:20,443
So, I was at a party, I made friends.

308
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:26,866
The party was on a street.
I went downstairs to go to the bathroom.

309
00:14:29,035 --> 00:14:31,204
The house...

310
00:14:31,496 --> 00:14:34,416
It had floors,
I went down to go to the bathroom.

311
00:14:34,624 --> 00:14:36,126
When I got out...

312
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:39,337
one guy did this with his arm.

313
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,590
I was high on wine,

314
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,466
at that time I used to drink...

315
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:44,426
He was too.

316
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,970
Guys, having sex high on wine...

317
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:50,390
He said, "Let's go
to the last floor and all..."

318
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:51,975
Up or down?

319
00:14:51,975 --> 00:14:55,645
Upstairs. I saw there was nobody...

320
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:58,356
I said, "Let's go."
I went upstairs with him.

321
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,318
But the rooftop was under construction,

322
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:07,449
there was a lot of building supplies,
you know? Some cement bags.

323
00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:09,701
She was all dirty with cement.

324
00:15:10,327 --> 00:15:14,831
The last cement bag was open,
and I didn't know cement sticks on you.

325
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:20,670
My back was very sweaty,
I laid down on the cement bag.

326
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:23,465
I was with the guy. Man, when I got up,

327
00:15:23,590 --> 00:15:27,677
I moved my hand like this
that thing didn't come off, you know?

328
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:33,099
You made a plaster with that sweat
and the cement, you could repair a wall!

329
00:15:33,224 --> 00:15:35,852
Man, I know I had

330
00:15:36,061 --> 00:15:38,980
cement all over my back,
on the back of my head.

331
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,232
That thing wouldn't come off.

332
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,401
"Look, the brick is walking."

333
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:45,362
Was it good?

334
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:46,863
I had to... Yes!

335
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:49,157
- John?
- Airport bathroom.

336
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:50,659
Airport bathroom?

337
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:53,161
Because you can't do that in a plane!

338
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,622
I'm six feet and four inches tall.

339
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,916
Imagine two people inside a bathroom!

340
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,876
What about you, Lexa?

341
00:16:00,251 --> 00:16:02,754
- In the staff van.
- In the staff van?

342
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:05,548
Oh, that's fancy,
it's got air conditioner.

343
00:16:05,548 --> 00:16:07,926
- You?
- I go to the church.

344
00:16:07,926 --> 00:16:09,719
Answer!

345
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:12,389
The most unusual place?

346
00:16:12,389 --> 00:16:17,977
I, in my early teens, with a lot of
hormones, anything gets you...

347
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:20,605
I went to the photo booth, in the mall.

348
00:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,774
- What?
- Remember those places?

349
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:28,363
You'd insert a coin, adjust the seat
and took the picture... I'm old, I'm 34.

350
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:32,450
There was a booth,
you pulled a curtain and got in.

351
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,703
Guys, I can't take this.

352
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:38,373
Jeez!

353
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,083
Gosh!

354
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:43,378
Oh, my God! What's this?

355
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:46,339
Look at John, man. What a whore, bro!

356
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,009
I wish I was in that event.

357
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,011
I know the outfit I'd wear.

358
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,472
I'm that person who fixes everybody up.

359
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,307
Pabllo, you wanted to be there?

360
00:16:56,641 --> 00:16:59,519
Who would you kiss?

361
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,104
All of them!

362
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:07,026
- What about you, Carol?
- I like this thing here, watching...

363
00:17:07,402 --> 00:17:08,403
Yeah, right!

364
00:17:08,737 --> 00:17:11,072
What about you? Would you kiss?

365
00:17:11,072 --> 00:17:13,742
That depends on the mood.

366
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:15,326
You have to choose one.

367
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,412
- One?
- Yes, pick one.

368
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:20,623
- Tay, Nath, Bia or Anna? Now.
- Anna.

369
00:17:20,915 --> 00:17:24,419
Anna got there a hit, right?
What about you, Lexa?

370
00:17:24,586 --> 00:17:27,172
I want to see everybody kissing.

371
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:29,174
- Have corn flakes and sleep?
- Sure!

372
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:31,634
I'd be that person too, that's for sure.

373
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:33,344
I'd give it up for this.

374
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,931
I'd go to the bedroom with Nath
and her boy.

375
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:41,311
I imagined you'd want to hook up
with everybody, men, women, and pets!

376
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:43,438
Guys, I... I'd get there horny.

377
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:47,150
He'd fuck an ashtray
and have sex with the pool...

378
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:50,153
- Not yet?
- Is it gonna be me all the time?

379
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:52,030
Is it gonna be just me?

380
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,156
She was moaning.

381
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:55,575
Fuck, I love Tay!

382
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:57,994
If you knew how much I'm hurt!

383
00:17:57,994 --> 00:18:01,080
- Kissing is no big deal.
- Guys!

384
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,417
I'm gonna tell you, he was very honest.

385
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:05,835
Yes, he was.

386
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,879
He shifted the paradigm.

387
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:09,464
I felt her pain.

388
00:18:09,464 --> 00:18:12,467
Like, she was really hurt.

389
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:15,637
Exactly. You can get both of them.

390
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:17,639
He was very honest with her.

391
00:18:17,639 --> 00:18:19,808
They are both hurt!

392
00:18:19,808 --> 00:18:21,559
They like each other.

393
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:25,438
Man, Tay makes no mistakes...
Tay was very classy.

394
00:18:25,438 --> 00:18:28,274
But put yourself in Tay's shoes,
Lexa, so what?

395
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:32,362
That situation is hard,
but I admire him for telling her.

396
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:34,572
Expressing his feelings.

397
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:39,661
But that's the thing. It looks like
she gave him an opportunity.

398
00:18:39,828 --> 00:18:43,623
But that depends on him,
if he's gonna be ignorant,

399
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:48,837
- irrational or...
- Murilo's disciplined, you know?

400
00:18:48,837 --> 00:18:50,755
He will

401
00:18:50,755 --> 00:18:53,383
embrace the opportunity.

402
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:57,011
He has to embrace it. If he gets upset...

403
00:18:57,011 --> 00:19:01,516
If it were a friend of yours
that you love, what would you tell her?

404
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:03,685
"Girl, you wanna be with him?"

405
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:05,353
I'd ask her that too.

406
00:19:05,353 --> 00:19:06,604
But...

407
00:19:06,604 --> 00:19:08,857
You can't interfere. Shut up!

408
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:12,986
But do you think Murilo is a smart guy?

409
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:14,070
Yes!

410
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,322
He's a disciplined boy, you know?

411
00:19:16,322 --> 00:19:19,284
If she's... He wants to be with her,
that's clear.

412
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:24,080
If she's clear about that, if he is
trustworthy and honest until the end,

413
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:27,125
he's gonna embrace the opportunity.

414
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:33,047
She's given him that opportunity
when she said, "Let's take things slow."

415
00:19:33,047 --> 00:19:36,259
But I think now they're beginning
to communicate.

416
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,928
They didn't communicate in the beginning.

417
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:41,890
If he doesn't understand it
and becomes ignorant...

418
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:47,520
From what I recall, last summer,
Murilo didn't do anything that bad.

419
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,481
Both of them walked the line.

420
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,609
They respected each other.

421
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,235
Let's see!

422
00:19:54,235 --> 00:19:58,197
And she said, if he did what Luan did,
she'd set him on fire.

423
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:02,660
Then I get here,
we have a real nice moment...

424
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:07,624
If it were any other girl
that I had hooked up with and said,

425
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,043
"Man, let's be promiscuous?" "Yes."

426
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:11,294
I'd say yes.

427
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:14,422
- I didn't say that.
- But we have a history, you know?

428
00:20:14,422 --> 00:20:16,341
Don't put words in my mouth.

429
00:20:16,341 --> 00:20:18,635
We have a history.

430
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:21,387
Who's this girl?

431
00:20:21,763 --> 00:20:25,516
She was hearing the talk
and said, "Yeah, I really think so."

432
00:20:25,516 --> 00:20:28,186
Tay, our time is gone, okay.

433
00:20:29,145 --> 00:20:30,855
Our time is gone.

434
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:34,108
Let's not have this conversation.
Let's have fun.

435
00:20:34,108 --> 00:20:38,363
I didn't get that last part
because he said that... That thing.

436
00:20:38,363 --> 00:20:41,491
I thought he'd say
a lot of pretty things...

437
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:42,700
Exactly.

438
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,870
Hey, Luan, don't let me
mess things up again.

439
00:20:46,204 --> 00:20:50,083
Bro, gag me, tie me, please, right now.

440
00:20:50,083 --> 00:20:51,751
Man, tie me, please, tie me.

441
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,920
Tie me, please.

442
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:57,090
Gag me, please. Knock me out.

443
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,425
I'm gonna do it soon, you'll sleep.

444
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:02,136
Gag me, please. Knock me out.

445
00:21:02,136 --> 00:21:05,598
What? Huh? What?

446
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:08,434
Who?

447
00:21:08,434 --> 00:21:13,106
Murilo. Here. On you, right now, fuck!
Get fucking real!

448
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,191
What's this?

449
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:19,487
He said, "Didn't you feel him bumping
his dick into your knee?"

450
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:20,571
Murilo...

451
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:23,700
Beatriz, his dick
was bumping into your knee.

452
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:26,160
He said Murilo bumped his...

453
00:21:26,411 --> 00:21:27,787
Get real, bro!

454
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:29,747
I was watching! I was waiting.

455
00:21:29,747 --> 00:21:31,457
Get the fucking leg off!

456
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:33,876
Do you think I was feeling his dick?

457
00:21:33,876 --> 00:21:35,837
Bro, weren't you feeling it?

458
00:21:36,713 --> 00:21:37,922
Fuck you!

459
00:21:38,214 --> 00:21:40,466
Stop it, Luan.

460
00:21:41,426 --> 00:21:42,593
That's not possible!

461
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:45,346
I would stop talking. It's not worth it.

462
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:50,101
Do you think he's gonna bump his dick
into my knee, and I'm feeling his dick?

463
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:52,979
- Fuck, into my knee!
- No, you aren't!

464
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:55,857
No. You're not normal, you're a saint!

465
00:21:55,857 --> 00:21:58,276
Stop it, Luan!

466
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:03,322
Girl, there's nothing to do.
You gotta laugh at that situation...

467
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,490
Depressing!

468
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,576
Do you want more dick?

469
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:09,037
- For God's sake!
- Do you miss a dick?

470
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:15,918
You know what bothers me the most?
He wants to play the tough guy with her...

471
00:22:16,294 --> 00:22:18,087
What an ass...

472
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:20,173
He didn't go talk to the guy!

473
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:25,094
But that was obvious last summer's end.
When they had that fight...

474
00:22:25,636 --> 00:22:31,142
He plays the tough man and when somebody
confronts him, he chickens out.

475
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:33,686
It was Murilo.

476
00:22:33,686 --> 00:22:37,940
Regardless of what Murilo did,
if it was on purpose...

477
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:41,694
Luan's attitude toward Bia
was completely wrong.

478
00:22:41,694 --> 00:22:46,282
He should have talked to Murilo.
He should have gone to talk to him.

479
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:49,035
I've already told you. He's an ass, bro.

480
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:52,997
Why did he have to argue with her?
She was doing absolutely nothing.

481
00:22:53,164 --> 00:22:56,751
He didn't talk loud to her,
he whispered in her ear...

482
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:58,795
So Murilo didn't hear!

483
00:22:58,795 --> 00:23:01,798
When Murilo was far,
he started to scream at her...

484
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:02,715
He manned up!

485
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:07,428
If she wanted to talk and tell her friends
what was going on, she didn't know...

486
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:12,558
- She's lost and there's booze involved...
- Poor girl, she was completely lost.

487
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,852
I can see her situation.

488
00:23:14,852 --> 00:23:20,399
Her friends must support her,
she must stand up for herself.

489
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:23,945
Regarding Tay and Murilo, he said
stupid things.

490
00:23:23,945 --> 00:23:26,906
Men got lost in that party.

491
00:23:26,906 --> 00:23:30,451
They had the chance to get along,
to express themselves...

492
00:23:30,451 --> 00:23:31,452
They were wrong!

493
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:32,495
They fucked up!

494
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:35,957
Yeah, I think Luan and Murilo...

495
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:38,251
made a huge mistake. Because Tay

496
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:42,880
gave him a chance, and...

497
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,257
He screwed up!

498
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:46,717
...he wasn't rational, he didn't get

499
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:50,805
the opportunity she was giving him,
and he wasted it all, you know?

500
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:55,601
What I think about Murilo and Tay
is that they didn't have that breaking up

501
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:58,604
every relationship needs.

502
00:23:58,604 --> 00:24:00,273
They're having it now.

503
00:24:00,273 --> 00:24:02,400
I think they won't be...

504
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,196
Like the breaking up Nath and Ramon had.

505
00:24:07,196 --> 00:24:08,614
And they are cool.

506
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:09,907
Really cool!

507
00:24:09,907 --> 00:24:14,162
They don't have any problems. They need
that kind of breaking up to be cool.

508
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:17,790
Because, in the past,
they didn't get along very well,

509
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:22,086
because they always had a fight.
Now Murilo always respected Tay a lot.

510
00:24:22,086 --> 00:24:23,963
So, this is mutual.

511
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:29,177
We're on episode two,
we still have a long way to go, man.

512
00:24:29,177 --> 00:24:32,430
Let's see what's going to happen
on the next, go.

513
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:35,016
IN THE NEXT EPISODE

514
00:24:35,016 --> 00:24:37,185
Bro, there's no more "you and me"!

515
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:41,898
No!

516
00:24:42,273 --> 00:24:43,608
My Gosh!

517
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:46,819
I'm shocked!

518
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:49,488
This is going to end up in a lot of sex.

519
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,365
