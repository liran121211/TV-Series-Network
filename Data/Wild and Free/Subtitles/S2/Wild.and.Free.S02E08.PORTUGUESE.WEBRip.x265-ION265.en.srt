WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS 2
THE REVIEW

2
00:00:07,675 --> 00:00:08,884
I'm an angel.

3
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:10,511
Hi, everybody.

4
00:00:10,511 --> 00:00:12,555
What's up, guys?

5
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:16,225
Doesn't she look like a cupcake?

6
00:00:16,225 --> 00:00:18,936
That "hello guys"
is the best in the world.

7
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:22,690
Looks like Pabllo has
a pineapple on her head. I love it.

8
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:24,066
Do you like it, baby?

9
00:00:24,191 --> 00:00:27,153
Sis, what's going... Guys, I'm leaving.

10
00:00:27,153 --> 00:00:28,904
I'm not at her level.

11
00:00:28,904 --> 00:00:30,823
You came straight from there!

12
00:00:30,823 --> 00:00:32,450
You came from Ibiza!

13
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:33,743
Real humble.

14
00:00:33,743 --> 00:00:35,661
To fit the mood!

15
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:38,164
I can't help noticing

16
00:00:38,164 --> 00:00:40,207
that Jerry is hot, he's so chic.

17
00:00:40,332 --> 00:00:43,210
Thanks a lot. Do you like it?

18
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,337
Look at that look!

19
00:00:45,337 --> 00:00:47,256
But Lexa is awesome too, right?

20
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:48,174
And Carol!

21
00:00:48,174 --> 00:00:49,967
I'm showing off everything.

22
00:00:49,967 --> 00:00:51,594
Can you dance?

23
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,305
- Yes.
- Carol's a strawberry, I'll bite her.

24
00:00:55,139 --> 00:00:56,474
Show some respect!

25
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:58,809
What's this, Lexa?

26
00:00:58,809 --> 00:00:59,769
I'm dancing.

27
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:01,729
If I do that, my pants tear.

28
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:04,565
Lexa bathed in olive oil
to fit in these pants.

29
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:05,649
Jesus Christ.

30
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,903
Carol, you look great.
My highlighter is the same color.

31
00:01:09,445 --> 00:01:10,696
Thank you.

32
00:01:11,947 --> 00:01:12,782
You idiot.

33
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:17,077
Guys, I'm embarrassed.
I wanna leave because I cannot compete.

34
00:01:17,828 --> 00:01:19,330
Pabllo's on another level.

35
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,247
Pabllo, get up.

36
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,374
I'll ask for a crane to help you.

37
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:25,503
- Guys, look at this.
- It's something else!

38
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:27,296
Jesus Christ.

39
00:01:27,421 --> 00:01:28,964
That's what...

40
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,717
- Turn the volume down.
- Show it.

41
00:01:31,926 --> 00:01:33,135
Oh, Pabllo.

42
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:35,679
No, what about the hair?

43
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:36,847
Beautiful hair.

44
00:01:36,847 --> 00:01:40,810
Barbie. That's my reference today. Got it?

45
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:42,394
You're our Barbie.

46
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:44,939
Barbie from Florianópolis 2.

47
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,607
You're the best, sister.

48
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:47,817
I'll go there.

49
00:01:47,817 --> 00:01:50,611
You know what's worse?
The disagreement bus.

50
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:53,656
I started the vacation
wishing to take that bus,

51
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:55,991
but if I get in it, I'll fight.

52
00:01:56,158 --> 00:02:01,288
Because, even Tay, the most even-tempered,
got so mad at Murilo.

53
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:04,416
She got mad at everybody in the bus.

54
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,085
- I'm shocked!
- So am I.

55
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:08,671
I don't have the guts to get on this bus

56
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:10,548
because of my wig.

57
00:02:10,673 --> 00:02:15,135
I'm shocked with Tay
because she was even-tempered, classy,

58
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:18,597
and just when we think
we've seen it all in Florianópolis,

59
00:02:18,597 --> 00:02:20,891
we got Luan, who left the house.

60
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:24,311
I wonder if Bia
will finally enjoy her vacation.

61
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,230
I think she will.

62
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:27,857
Hit play!

63
00:02:27,857 --> 00:02:28,941
The remote's mine.

64
00:02:28,941 --> 00:02:31,527
I know, then hit play, honey!

65
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:33,737
- Can I hit play?
- Sure!

66
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,322
Are you guys excited?

67
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:40,995
Guys, I also made a decision, you know?

68
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:42,955
I asked to leave the house.

69
00:02:44,373 --> 00:02:45,791
What?

70
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:48,919
What did you say?

71
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:55,509
Look at Tay! Tay is sad.

72
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,679
He asked to leave to go to a party!

73
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:02,099
- It's a joke.
- Tay's sad.

74
00:03:02,224 --> 00:03:03,309
He said he did it.

75
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:04,768
Come on...

76
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,228
I knew it, bro!

77
00:03:06,228 --> 00:03:07,563
The beer is here.

78
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:10,232
- Jeez, motherfucker.
- Not funny!

79
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:11,692
Not funny!

80
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:13,360
Tay almost died.

81
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,738
Look at her face now!

82
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,531
I really ship that couple.

83
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,491
She likes him a lot.

84
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:22,119
Bia didn't believe that at all, girl.

85
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:23,662
She's still shocked!

86
00:03:24,914 --> 00:03:26,749
- Fuck!
- That's cute!

87
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:29,627
Poor girl, she's shaking!

88
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:31,170
I feel sorry for her.

89
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:32,421
Exactly.

90
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:33,964
I'm shocked!

91
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:35,883
Now, really...

92
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:38,761
He's being an asshole to her right now.

93
00:03:38,761 --> 00:03:43,307
We have to remember
she kicked him and didn't apologize.

94
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:44,350
It's true.

95
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:46,810
I think he lost an opportunity there.

96
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:57,738
Go, girl!

97
00:03:57,738 --> 00:04:02,201
Out of the blue. I love it.

98
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,828
Guys!

99
00:04:04,828 --> 00:04:06,830
It's like that, you see?

100
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:08,290
A kiss and bye!

101
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,584
It's okay to kiss your friend.

102
00:04:10,584 --> 00:04:13,462
That's it. Awesome! High five!

103
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:15,464
I won't complain either!

104
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:17,716
Buddy, it was great!

105
00:04:17,716 --> 00:04:21,387
They're gonna pretend nothing happened
and kiss the boys!

106
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,307
No, like, Anna got closer,
and Tay couldn't resist!

107
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:26,684
Carol...

108
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:30,270
you're at a party, Lexa comes and says...

109
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,690
Don't say... Do you kiss her?

110
00:04:32,815 --> 00:04:35,484
I don't go to parties,
I go to funk parties.

111
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:37,194
Wherever you want, bastard!

112
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:39,571
It never happened.

113
00:04:39,989 --> 00:04:42,241
Look who I'm talking about, Carol.

114
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:44,868
She's beautiful, wonderful,
perfect, but no.

115
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,204
Haven't you ever hooked up with a woman?

116
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:49,248
Me neither.

117
00:04:50,666 --> 00:04:53,293
Girl, I'd never say "no" to you,

118
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,254
you're hot, you're great.

119
00:04:55,254 --> 00:04:58,549
To Lexa, Pabllo, and Carol,
I'd never say "no".

120
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:00,217
And neither to you two.

121
00:05:02,428 --> 00:05:04,805
And neither to this glass, to this bowl.

122
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:06,682
I'm here!

123
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:14,523
Anna and Tay again.

124
00:05:14,648 --> 00:05:17,860
Again, I love that couple!

125
00:05:18,027 --> 00:05:20,362
Guys, I wonder if I ship them.

126
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:22,197
The ship's name's Antha.

127
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,616
No, bitch, no!

128
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:35,419
Did he hook up with Tay?

129
00:05:36,545 --> 00:05:39,381
Guys, are you following what's going on?

130
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:42,509
- She's fixing Renan up for Bia.
- For Bia!

131
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:45,471
The plot twist has arrived.

132
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:50,267
Tay said, "If I didn't have anybody
in my life, you'd be the first, but...

133
00:05:50,267 --> 00:05:51,769
"Bia's single.

134
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:54,521
"She's free, available,
and wants you very bad."

135
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:58,442
But you heard that Tay
threw shade again, like...

136
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:01,028
"If I didn't have anybody, it'd be you."

137
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:03,864
God, let's see
if it's gonna be really him.

138
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,700
Guys, she's playing the cupid
for her friend.

139
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,993
No...

140
00:06:07,993 --> 00:06:11,622
she took them to the altar
and to their honeymoon.

141
00:06:11,622 --> 00:06:14,291
Look at his face.
He's happy, really happy.

142
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,878
That's what I said, Mu, he's a nice guy.

143
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:19,546
Go.

144
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,006
Go!

145
00:06:21,006 --> 00:06:24,093
If there wasn't Luan,
I'd hook up with him immediately.

146
00:06:24,093 --> 00:06:27,096
Luan fucked up big time.

147
00:06:28,472 --> 00:06:29,807
Go, Bia!

148
00:06:29,973 --> 00:06:31,642
Fuck it!

149
00:06:32,601 --> 00:06:33,560
Kiss him.

150
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,106
Damn!

151
00:06:37,314 --> 00:06:39,358
More friends like Murilo.

152
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,611
- Go get it!
- I think Anna...

153
00:06:42,778 --> 00:06:44,696
looked and said,

154
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:48,158
"Since I already kissed him,
I'm gonna kiss Bia."

155
00:06:48,158 --> 00:06:50,661
Yeah, Anna is very free.

156
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:53,288
I think. Because Anna...

157
00:06:53,288 --> 00:06:56,750
Regardless of whom she kissed,
she needed to release,

158
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,210
I think she needed...

159
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:01,213
to lose that disgust of Luan.
That negative energy.

160
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:02,673
She lost that...

161
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:05,217
Bia is wonderful, goddess...

162
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:07,511
I think everybody is absolute.

163
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:09,179
The spell was broken.

164
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:12,432
What about Murilo? Wonderful!
Did you see what he did?

165
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:14,935
Guys, Murilo is very detached.

166
00:07:14,935 --> 00:07:17,771
He saw his chick kissing another chick.

167
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,065
Now he touched her hand!

168
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:24,278
But, guys, take it easy, okay?
We know things are handled on the bus.

169
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:26,530
It's great at parties,
with free booze.

170
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,533
- Yeah. So far so good.
- Handled on the bus.

171
00:07:34,288 --> 00:07:35,664
Gosh!

172
00:07:35,998 --> 00:07:38,584
Oh, glory.

173
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,131
His jaw is tired, you see?

174
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:46,049
A cramp in the cheek.

175
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:47,509
Like at carnivals.

176
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:49,303
He was surprised...

177
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:53,682
It's like, "Bro, I'm gonna have
to meet Luan later, man."

178
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,184
He hit on Tay too.

179
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:57,227
Guys, can you think about this?

180
00:07:57,227 --> 00:07:58,687
At this time?

181
00:07:58,687 --> 00:08:00,314
I don't think so.

182
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:02,482
He's thinking what's coming next.

183
00:08:02,608 --> 00:08:06,945
Guys, I'm very excited
because I'm dying to know...

184
00:08:06,945 --> 00:08:08,238
what happened.

185
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:10,157
I think it was wonderful.

186
00:08:10,449 --> 00:08:12,326
You'd do worse, right?

187
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:13,535
I would.

188
00:08:14,870 --> 00:08:16,121
Was the kiss good?

189
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,418
- Did I fuck up?
- Of course not!

190
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,420
You're free!

191
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,257
Guys, for God's sake, hit pause.

192
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:30,010
We need to stop a while and praise Nath.

193
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:31,220
Always!

194
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:32,387
She's sensible.

195
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,973
I'm like Nath.

196
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:37,601
Nath is my hero from Goiânia,

197
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:39,853
I say "Goiânia" and think about Nath.

198
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,480
I'm shocked with her.

199
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,940
Nath really changed.

200
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:45,025
This season, she came back changed.

201
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,526
She's great!

202
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:50,030
But I think she understood
the word "free," you know?

203
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,366
Vacation's for you to be free.

204
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:54,201
When Titto and I kissed,

205
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:56,703
I thought, "I'm gonna have
to finish this."

206
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:57,913
It was great.

207
00:09:00,290 --> 00:09:01,750
I'm a good kisser, right?

208
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,876
Obviously!

209
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:04,086
You see? Come here.

210
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:06,922
Pabllo, you at that... If you were Bia,

211
00:09:06,922 --> 00:09:07,965
you'd fuck him?

212
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:10,592
Oh, girl, I think I would.

213
00:09:10,592 --> 00:09:12,511
I think so because...

214
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:15,472
Luan's already gone, I'm beautiful,

215
00:09:15,472 --> 00:09:16,556
why not?

216
00:09:16,807 --> 00:09:18,767
- And Carol?
- What?

217
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:20,269
Would you fuck him?

218
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:24,189
You're not asking me that.

219
00:09:24,189 --> 00:09:27,567
You don't know
what you're talking about.

220
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:30,362
MC Carol says, "I have sex,
but I don't kiss."

221
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:33,865
Bia says she kisses, but doesn't have sex.

222
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:36,994
And how do you have the feeling
you wanna have sex?

223
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,829
The size of the forgiveness!

224
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:41,123
Isn't this what she says?

225
00:09:41,123 --> 00:09:44,543
But before she sees the size
of the forgiveness?

226
00:09:44,543 --> 00:09:46,878
She says, "Put out this dick, bro."

227
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:49,798
I ask for a picture.

228
00:09:49,798 --> 00:09:51,633
- I liked...
- At a party!

229
00:09:51,633 --> 00:09:52,718
How's it?

230
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:54,428
I don't go to parties!

231
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:57,055
At a funk party!

232
00:09:57,055 --> 00:09:59,474
I do this, "I wanna talk to you."

233
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:02,477
Then I give him

234
00:10:02,978 --> 00:10:05,772
my cell phone and say,
"Add your number there."

235
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:09,401
The other day,
I set a date, you know? And...

236
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:11,361
Fuck!

237
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:14,489
I don't like that.

238
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:18,994
The disappointment is terrible,
the size of the forgiveness...

239
00:10:18,994 --> 00:10:20,704
- Really?
- Holy Mary!

240
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:24,875
I'm gonna tell you something.
To gay people, to babes, to everybody.

241
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,919
Don't expect anything, guys.

242
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,756
We romanticize the size of the dick a lot.

243
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:32,007
I want a huge one?

244
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,633
Maybe I do.

245
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:35,927
I want one which fills in everything?

246
00:10:35,927 --> 00:10:36,970
What?

247
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,222
Some people don't know how to use...

248
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:40,432
That's it!

249
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,684
I had a lot of moments

250
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:46,897
that weren't twenty-three,
twenty-four, twenty-five, girl?

251
00:10:47,022 --> 00:10:48,357
Twenty-five?

252
00:10:48,357 --> 00:10:50,025
But that's the size of...

253
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,402
Twenty-five is the size of a foot.

254
00:10:52,402 --> 00:10:54,571
No, I've never had a twenty-five.

255
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:57,157
He's an alien
to have a 25-centimeter dick.

256
00:10:57,157 --> 00:11:00,077
Do you use an air pump to inflate that?

257
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:02,079
Guys, let's see...

258
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:04,956
if she's gonna have
this forgiveness today.

259
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,969
There's inspiration here.

260
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:19,805
Yes.

261
00:11:23,517 --> 00:11:25,644
You're a miss? "Miss Chievous."

262
00:11:27,145 --> 00:11:28,897
I didn't get anything.

263
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:30,065
What happened?

264
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,234
We'd just praised Nath a lot.

265
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:35,695
She didn't like the girl Ramon was with,

266
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:38,949
and asked her,
"You're a miss? 'Miss Chievous'."

267
00:11:39,491 --> 00:11:40,909
Fuck, Nath!

268
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,994
We can't support you when...

269
00:11:42,994 --> 00:11:44,371
Didn't you miss Nath?

270
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,373
You said you did, she's back!

271
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:50,335
I don't know. I missed her.

272
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:52,379
I wanted her to make a mess.

273
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,966
Guys, you can't be sensible
all the time, right?

274
00:11:55,966 --> 00:11:57,801
I know it's bad...

275
00:11:57,801 --> 00:12:00,345
but, guys, I missed that Nath.

276
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,222
You can't only be sensible.

277
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,224
There's no way!

278
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:08,895
Nath made the best mess
in the first vacation.

279
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:11,648
We certainly have to look
at the funny side.

280
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:15,318
I'm gonna look like
the boring uncle.

281
00:12:15,318 --> 00:12:17,737
You have to look at the funny side,

282
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:19,865
but when a joke insults others,

283
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,491
- it's not funny!
- No...

284
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:23,869
Wait, man, let me finish.

285
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:25,662
Speak, rabble-rouser.

286
00:12:25,662 --> 00:12:28,999
- When you're not insulted.
- Obviously.

287
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:32,210
If it makes everybody laugh at you,
it's an insult.

288
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:35,255
She made fun of that girl
in front of everybody.

289
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:37,883
I don't like this, my opinion.

290
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:39,092
I agree.

291
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:40,802
What's this? "I'm talking?"

292
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:42,220
Give it up for her.

293
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,389
Using your fake nails, sorry.

294
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:46,349
You're right!

295
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:49,102
I agree with you.

296
00:12:49,102 --> 00:12:52,814
But Nath put up with a lot of things.

297
00:12:52,814 --> 00:12:54,774
We thought she'd gotten over him.

298
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:57,527
That Ramon and Nath were mature.

299
00:12:57,527 --> 00:13:00,363
We know Ramon would never do that...

300
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,948
No, Ramon is cool.

301
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:03,658
Wanna see it?

302
00:13:03,658 --> 00:13:05,494
It's about time!

303
00:13:05,994 --> 00:13:08,705
- Wanna see it? I push this girl.
- Get a grip.

304
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:11,249
You're tripping, Nath.

305
00:13:14,002 --> 00:13:16,713
Baby, that girl is sitting on Ramon's lap.

306
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,673
She doesn't want any trouble.

307
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:22,969
I think Nath controlled herself
and thought, "So far I was very ethical,

308
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:26,306
"I'm tired of holding everybody's horses."

309
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:28,141
Don't laugh!

310
00:13:28,141 --> 00:13:29,476
She's not right.

311
00:13:30,018 --> 00:13:32,395
I laughed, but she's not right.

312
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:34,898
She doesn't have
to take it out on anybody.

313
00:13:34,898 --> 00:13:37,234
- I agree.
- But like now...

314
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:41,279
Finally, we agree. Nath made a mistake.

315
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,322
Nonsense.

316
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:43,823
Bad!

317
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:46,785
I think she had
to work things out with Ramon.

318
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,954
I won't cover up for anybody.

319
00:13:48,954 --> 00:13:50,956
But she might still like him.

320
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:53,166
Of course she does.

321
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,460
Guys. I don't know. I...

322
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:58,255
If I hooked up with somebody...

323
00:13:58,255 --> 00:13:59,756
We are not together...

324
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:02,842
We've hooked up,
but I see you with another girl.

325
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:05,720
Sis, be happy,
I'll hook up with others too.

326
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:09,224
Yes, It's not like that
if you feel something.

327
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:14,479
Jerry. Do you think Ramon
feels the same about Nath?

328
00:14:14,479 --> 00:14:16,398
He has a crush on her.

329
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:18,900
But I think he's way cooler than her now.

330
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,027
That attitude of his

331
00:14:21,027 --> 00:14:26,741
made her feel
that way about him.

332
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:27,951
His confidence?

333
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:30,453
Yeah, all that confidence... Damn, man.

334
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,497
He's happy, hooking up...

335
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:36,084
I think... He forgot me... That's when...

336
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:39,170
It's because he's not honest.

337
00:14:39,170 --> 00:14:41,506
He doesn't express his feelings.

338
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,223
That's funny, right?

339
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,517
And there's no bed for me?

340
00:14:52,642 --> 00:14:55,729
Everyone gets a bed, right?

341
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,111
Oh, that's great.

342
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:05,447
I love that position.

343
00:15:05,614 --> 00:15:07,449
It's makeup sex, right?

344
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:09,618
A car got there.

345
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:12,495
A car got there.

346
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:19,836
He bleached his hair. Do the L, Lacerda.

347
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,797
Guys, that's Renatinho!

348
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:25,800
He's Ramon's friend, he invited him.

349
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:28,428
He bleached his hair, you know.

350
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:33,433
Fuck, you're rad.

351
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:37,103
I wonder if he's gonna win Anna's heart.

352
00:15:37,103 --> 00:15:38,980
Because Anna is detached, baby.

353
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:41,483
Go, Blond boy!

354
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:42,400
Fuck!

355
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,986
Does he know everybody?

356
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:46,821
It was a joke, right?

357
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:49,491
Sure. Whose idea?

358
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:52,202
They're friends, right?

359
00:15:52,202 --> 00:15:54,663
Renan is Ramon's friend.

360
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:59,167
Jeez, he's great. He's cute, neat.

361
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:01,169
- Who?
- The newbie.

362
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,587
The blond guy.

363
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:04,297
I know it.

364
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:08,551
Bro, if anybody shows up wearing anything,

365
00:16:08,551 --> 00:16:10,762
John will say, "I wanna fuck him!"

366
00:16:10,762 --> 00:16:12,931
Leave my hormones alone.

367
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:16,267
- Let me introduce.
- Hi.

368
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:18,103
- Renato.
- Nice to meet you.

369
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:20,814
Is it Milena's boy?

370
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:23,441
Jeez!

371
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,652
"Hey, man, jeez, dude. I know her."

372
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:28,697
"Aren't you Milena's boy?
Jeez, dude. I know her."

373
00:16:28,697 --> 00:16:29,739
Jeez!

374
00:16:30,949 --> 00:16:31,991
That's heavy!

375
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,785
I guess you haven't met.

376
00:16:33,785 --> 00:16:36,621
Grow up, dude. Go... I'll tell you later.

377
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:37,664
Fuck.

378
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:38,915
Man, but ex is ex.

379
00:16:38,915 --> 00:16:40,458
The atmosphere is heavy.

380
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:41,751
She has the scoop...

381
00:16:41,751 --> 00:16:43,712
She must have the full scoop.

382
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:46,423
Easy there, honey.

383
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:49,426
The soap is here.

384
00:16:49,426 --> 00:16:50,885
Here.

385
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,472
I'd give him the conditioner and bye!

386
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:56,391
Hairstylist Leila.

387
00:16:56,391 --> 00:16:58,226
Nails, moisturizer...

388
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:01,354
"Baby, it's here, figure it out."

389
00:17:01,354 --> 00:17:02,731
She's not interested...

390
00:17:02,731 --> 00:17:04,649
She's taking it seriously.

391
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:06,401
"Tell me when you're done.

392
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:08,111
"I will come back to rinse it."

393
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:13,616
I'd rather the other guy
than the rookie.

394
00:17:13,616 --> 00:17:18,246
I think Renan
is going to lose Anna to Renatinho.

395
00:17:18,872 --> 00:17:23,042
If he's quick, he can kiss her right now.

396
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:25,920
I would have kissed him.

397
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:27,380
It's close.

398
00:17:27,922 --> 00:17:29,132
I'll lay over there.

399
00:17:29,841 --> 00:17:30,925
Did she say that?

400
00:17:31,092 --> 00:17:33,845
Wonderful!

401
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:37,849
She said, "This guy wants
to hook up with me in the shower.

402
00:17:37,849 --> 00:17:40,769
"But I want to do it in the bed, so..."

403
00:17:40,894 --> 00:17:44,147
She chose to be in control.

404
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,361
I got it!

405
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:52,197
Fuck, come here, boy.

406
00:17:52,697 --> 00:17:55,825
I got it, they went
to the sex room, obviously.

407
00:17:57,494 --> 00:17:59,454
I wanna see sex, fuck.

408
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:02,832
There's gonna be sex.

409
00:18:03,792 --> 00:18:06,628
- Anna's an icon!
- Girl, you made the sound.

410
00:18:07,170 --> 00:18:09,380
Guys, Anna's an icon!

411
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:11,966
Bitch, she's awesome.

412
00:18:11,966 --> 00:18:14,803
I hope Anna's on top,
because if she is, well...

413
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:16,846
Wait...

414
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:19,307
If it's not Anna, who's on top?

415
00:18:19,307 --> 00:18:22,602
- No, it could be him.
- There's no way!

416
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:24,729
As far as I'm concerned...

417
00:18:25,063 --> 00:18:27,148
- I thought it was that.
- Hit play.

418
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,445
It could be him.

419
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:34,864
No, there's no way it could be him.

420
00:18:34,864 --> 00:18:37,492
What ass is that without legs?

421
00:18:37,492 --> 00:18:39,118
Fuck, she's like...

422
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,912
Naughty girl show your power

423
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:43,873
Yeah, go, young girl, rock...

424
00:18:44,082 --> 00:18:47,377
Fuck, I'm very shocked,
Anna really nailed it.

425
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:51,047
She hooked up with whoever she wanted,
with Tay, and had sex.

426
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:52,966
I think it's great.

427
00:18:52,966 --> 00:18:54,384
- Was it good?
- Yes.

428
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:56,886
- Did you cum?
- Yes.

429
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:58,763
Did you cum?

430
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:01,224
That boy is skinny, but he's got it!

431
00:19:01,724 --> 00:19:03,393
He must have a big dick.

432
00:19:03,393 --> 00:19:05,812
Renatinho, say whatever you want.

433
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:08,356
You can say whatever you want.

434
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:11,401
When I was almost cumming...
I had a cramp.

435
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:14,487
I swear. I had a cramp at the time.

436
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:16,781
My whole leg froze, ridiculous.

437
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:18,157
Crazy talk.

438
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,076
He had a cramp in his leg?

439
00:19:20,076 --> 00:19:22,120
He had a cramp in his leg.

440
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:24,038
I've been there.

441
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:25,957
- Here.
- In the thigh?

442
00:19:25,957 --> 00:19:28,126
I think... Basically, here...

443
00:19:28,126 --> 00:19:30,044
on the side, in the ass.

444
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:32,422
- Cramp in the middle of sex?
- Yes.

445
00:19:32,422 --> 00:19:36,718
- So?
- You have to hold on and keep going.

446
00:19:36,718 --> 00:19:39,137
- You didn't stop?
- No.

447
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:41,097
I defeated the cramp.

448
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:43,808
What a big cramp, right, my brother?

449
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,602
What about you, John?

450
00:19:45,602 --> 00:19:46,603
No.

451
00:19:46,603 --> 00:19:48,897
I'm picturing myself in Anna's shoes.

452
00:19:48,897 --> 00:19:50,273
What position?

453
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:51,733
Legs up missionary.

454
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:54,986
- What's this?
- You have to simulate.

455
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:57,030
We're gonna have to simulate.

456
00:19:57,030 --> 00:19:59,616
He doesn't know.

457
00:19:59,616 --> 00:20:01,242
With you?

458
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:03,202
Some people don't know.

459
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:04,370
Go, Jerry.

460
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,371
Is that it?

461
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,875
Jeez, Jesus Christ.

462
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:11,169
- Come. I'm ready.
- Fuck.

463
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:13,588
Bro, that missionary is messed up, man.

464
00:20:13,713 --> 00:20:15,840
Carol, have you ever had a cramp?

465
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,176
- Yes, of course, guys.
- Me too.

466
00:20:18,176 --> 00:20:20,887
I've had pain, the other day...

467
00:20:21,304 --> 00:20:22,305
Where?

468
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:25,141
In the legs, in the knee, in the kneecap.

469
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:27,894
Now it's called "patella".

470
00:20:27,894 --> 00:20:29,187
Why?

471
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:31,189
I needed a painkiller the next day.

472
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,192
But why? Because you were riding?

473
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:36,069
Or because of a blowjob?

474
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:39,113
No, because of the positions the guy does.

475
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,074
- Hey, John.
- I love this topic.

476
00:20:41,074 --> 00:20:44,285
The position John was talking about,
spreading the legs,

477
00:20:44,285 --> 00:20:47,538
some guys are unbelievable.
They think you're an athlete,

478
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,248
that you're like spaghetti.

479
00:20:49,499 --> 00:20:51,751
Like what? What are you like, Carol?

480
00:20:51,751 --> 00:20:53,461
...and put your leg here.

481
00:20:53,461 --> 00:20:55,588
Like "Spaghetti"!

482
00:20:55,588 --> 00:20:56,839
"Spaghetti".

483
00:20:56,839 --> 00:21:00,551
The guy wants to fuck on a cement bag,

484
00:21:00,551 --> 00:21:02,595
bricks, rocks...

485
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:05,723
On the cement bag,
I was in a spread-eagle position.

486
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:07,600
You lay down like this.

487
00:21:09,435 --> 00:21:12,897
Anyway. One day, I got a...

488
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:15,191
I'm picturing it.

489
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,193
I've pictured the moment!

490
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:20,655
I've pictured Carol
right in that moment too.

491
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,740
The cement bag was open, sis.

492
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:25,159
It was open, sticking to the skin.

493
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,578
All covered in cement!

494
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:29,372
All covered in white dust.

495
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:31,916
Just throw it in the oil.
Fried chicken.

496
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,751
Breaded, right, girl?

497
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:36,838
Jerry, when you have a cramp,

498
00:21:37,755 --> 00:21:38,923
call me.

499
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:52,186
It's all about this!

500
00:21:52,186 --> 00:21:54,689
She showed what she came there for, right?

501
00:21:54,689 --> 00:21:57,191
That's it. She nailed it.

502
00:21:57,734 --> 00:21:58,651
She nailed it.

503
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,863
"If another friend comes,
I'll hook up with him too.

504
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:03,239
"I'm free."

505
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:07,452
I think she only hooked up
with the other guy because she felt...

506
00:22:07,452 --> 00:22:08,578
No...

507
00:22:08,578 --> 00:22:12,081
That bro was giving attention to Nath.

508
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,250
- Do you think that was it?
- Yes.

509
00:22:14,250 --> 00:22:16,669
She looked...
She had a look on her face.

510
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,296
Then she thought,

511
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:20,173
"I'll hook up with others too."

512
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:24,177
But Anna does that
in a very beautiful way, very subtle.

513
00:22:24,302 --> 00:22:26,554
She thought, "I won't waste time.

514
00:22:26,763 --> 00:22:30,308
"I'm doing nothing too,
I'm gonna hook up with another guy."

515
00:22:30,308 --> 00:22:33,436
- There's not much to say.
- Exactly.

516
00:22:33,436 --> 00:22:36,689
No, here's what I think,

517
00:22:36,689 --> 00:22:38,608
I think she's very...

518
00:22:38,608 --> 00:22:39,942
She's very honest.

519
00:22:39,942 --> 00:22:42,153
If she were Nath...

520
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:44,530
If she were in Nath's shoes,

521
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:47,658
the girls that are
more connected than the boys.

522
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:50,078
Nath, she'd hook up with him on purpose.

523
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:52,080
So there'd be that atmosphere.

524
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:53,456
But she wanted it.

525
00:22:53,456 --> 00:22:56,876
I think she did that because
she wanted it.

526
00:22:56,876 --> 00:22:58,920
Anna didn't do that for show.

527
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:02,340
But I'm not saying she did that
to show to anybody,

528
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,258
she waited for the guy's approval.

529
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:06,344
I think she didn't wait for this.

530
00:23:06,344 --> 00:23:08,930
And she didn't need his approval, right?

531
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,390
Renato came to me and said, "First chick

532
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,060
"in the house
who drew my attention was Nath."

533
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,186
He told me too.

534
00:23:15,186 --> 00:23:17,688
Then he just said, "What do I do?"

535
00:23:17,688 --> 00:23:21,275
No, he fucked her, took a sip,
and went to hook up with Nath.

536
00:23:21,275 --> 00:23:22,985
No, hey...

537
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,863
He couldn't hook up with Nath?

538
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:27,573
Would you hook up with him?

539
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,867
Not today, but tomorrow...

540
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:31,327
That's it, buddy.

541
00:23:32,495 --> 00:23:35,540
But I get fucked up all the time.

542
00:23:35,665 --> 00:23:38,167
I couldn't hook up with Luan.

543
00:23:38,167 --> 00:23:41,129
Tay would hook up with Renato,
and I can't with you.

544
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:43,464
Why can't you hook up with me?

545
00:23:43,464 --> 00:23:44,882
Tay told me...

546
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:47,135
You know what?

547
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,762
Would you hit on her anyway?

548
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:52,098
She said something, wait.

549
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:55,143
"I'd hook up with him tomorrow!"

550
00:23:55,143 --> 00:23:57,395
No, I think he misunderstood.

551
00:23:57,395 --> 00:23:58,855
He misunderstood.

552
00:23:58,855 --> 00:23:59,772
Yes.

553
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,275
He misunderstood.

554
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:05,319
But, at the same time,
I understand his pain.

555
00:24:05,319 --> 00:24:07,238
Because he likes her, you know?

556
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:10,074
But he asked her
to put herself in his shoes!

557
00:24:10,074 --> 00:24:12,326
- Then she answered.
- But, you know...

558
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:13,744
He misunderstood.

559
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,663
Let's see what's gonna happen.

560
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:17,206
Press play!

561
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:29,051
Look, he misunderstood...

562
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:32,471
He really did.

563
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,389
Look...

564
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:35,183
She figured that out.

565
00:24:36,058 --> 00:24:37,351
Poor girl!

566
00:24:37,351 --> 00:24:39,729
I feel sorry for her.

567
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:41,189
Poor girl.

568
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,733
God!

569
00:24:47,278 --> 00:24:48,404
Guys!

570
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:49,655
It's over, honey.

571
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,699
What did she misunderstand?

572
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:55,161
We thought she had cried
because Murilo kissed Anna.

573
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:56,954
But the whole problem was

574
00:24:56,954 --> 00:24:59,332
because Murilo misunderstood everything.

575
00:24:59,332 --> 00:25:02,168
He understood Tay wanted to kiss the guy,

576
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:04,295
not today, but tomorrow!

577
00:25:04,295 --> 00:25:05,796
I was cut off like this.

578
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:09,050
Girl, do you think...
Do you think that person

579
00:25:09,050 --> 00:25:10,468
will think about it?

580
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:12,845
But other people take the blame.

581
00:25:12,845 --> 00:25:15,473
I once had my leg cut because of this.

582
00:25:15,473 --> 00:25:16,515
Really?

583
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:19,435
Really. Those things,
one chick did this, bang!

584
00:25:19,435 --> 00:25:21,145
The bottle hit my leg.

585
00:25:21,145 --> 00:25:22,855
She was not my friend.

586
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:25,024
I wish I could fight at home,

587
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,692
throw things on the floor.

588
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,361
They must use plastic cups.

589
00:25:28,361 --> 00:25:31,072
Like, "I can't take
this bullshit anymore."

590
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:32,406
And bang!

591
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:33,950
Poor girl!

592
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:37,453
But I think she had an outburst.

593
00:25:37,453 --> 00:25:39,914
- She got angry.
- But man...

594
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:44,877
I'm not defending Tay,
but she was classy the whole time.

595
00:25:44,877 --> 00:25:46,879
She was very cool, I think...

596
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:49,799
I think it was a huge misunderstanding.

597
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,092
Again?

598
00:25:51,092 --> 00:25:53,052
She kicked him!

599
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,679
I forgot about that!

600
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:56,555
That's a lot of flamboyance!

601
00:25:56,889 --> 00:25:58,933
Hit play, please!

602
00:25:59,058 --> 00:26:00,810
Come with me.

603
00:26:01,477 --> 00:26:02,728
IN THE NEXT EPISODE

604
00:26:02,728 --> 00:26:04,855
One for all and all for one!

605
00:26:04,855 --> 00:26:07,066
Take it or leave it, let's go.

606
00:26:07,066 --> 00:26:09,610
Guys, today things are gonna get wild!

607
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:12,113
Triple kiss!

608
00:26:12,113 --> 00:26:15,074
When I wake up,
it looks like I sucked a dog's ass.

609
00:26:15,074 --> 00:26:16,951
I want to brush my teeth, man.

610
00:26:16,951 --> 00:26:19,036
That's disgusting!

611
00:26:19,412 --> 00:26:20,663
Jeez!

612
00:26:21,163 --> 00:26:23,499
- Hello.
- Good morning, customer service.

613
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:27,336
What a beautiful voice,
do you only work there?

614
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:31,132
I just work here only.
You know how it is, right?

615
00:26:32,550 --> 00:26:33,968
5:00 in the morning!

616
00:26:33,968 --> 00:26:36,053
Fuck, come here.

617
00:26:36,262 --> 00:26:38,139
Today it's gonna be messed up!

618
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,665
Creative supervisor
