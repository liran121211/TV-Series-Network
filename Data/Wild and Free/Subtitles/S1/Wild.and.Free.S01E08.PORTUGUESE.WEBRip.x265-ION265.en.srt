WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS
THE REVIEW

2
00:00:20,146 --> 00:00:21,981
Carol, I feel like banging you today.

3
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:24,024
- My God.
- I hate it!

4
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:24,984
Did I miss it?

5
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:26,944
Remember that man...

6
00:00:26,944 --> 00:00:27,903
That's Titto...

7
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:28,821
I'm to be seen.

8
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:30,740
Titto's jokes are the best.

9
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:33,284
Titto, do you like chocolate?

10
00:00:33,284 --> 00:00:34,243
Sure.

11
00:00:34,243 --> 00:00:35,661
Nice to meet you, Carol Show.

12
00:00:35,661 --> 00:00:36,871
Carol Show!

13
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:38,748
My joke is an old uncle's joke,

14
00:00:38,748 --> 00:00:40,207
but did you hear what Carol said?

15
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,709
What did she say?

16
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:44,211
"Titto, do you like chocolate?
Nice to meet you, Carol Show."

17
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:47,339
Buddy, when she's awake, she says it all.

18
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:50,050
When Carol wakes up, she just talks.

19
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,343
Is your name Google?

20
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:53,053
No, why?

21
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,514
Because I find
everything I look for in you.

22
00:00:58,476 --> 00:01:01,270
Fuck, John normally drools,
and with his mouth full...

23
00:01:02,062 --> 00:01:05,733
He crossed the line. Holy shit!

24
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:10,362
"Sorry"? That's really an accent.

25
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:16,285
Guys, we're back to watch
Episode 4 of Floripa Beach House.

26
00:01:16,285 --> 00:01:19,497
The last episode ended
with Murilo's guests kicked out

27
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:22,333
after fighting
with girls from the house, take a look.

28
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:24,919
Let's press play,
I'm dying to watch it. May I?

29
00:01:24,919 --> 00:01:27,254
Oh, please.

30
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:33,260
Did you find it cool? Did you like it?

31
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,137
Jeez, a lot.

32
00:01:35,346 --> 00:01:37,932
It was really cool
when you got to the party.

33
00:01:37,932 --> 00:01:40,601
The only one who had sex
last week was João.

34
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:41,644
Wait, look.

35
00:01:41,644 --> 00:01:45,439
All of a sudden,
you came in. At the right time.

36
00:01:47,066 --> 00:01:51,111
Blondie and João
are not friends with benefits anymore.

37
00:01:52,822 --> 00:01:55,032
I don't have anything to do...

38
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,618
Jeez, man.

39
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:59,537
She put him down. What a bitch.

40
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:00,955
I know, this was bad.

41
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:04,458
Now he's playing hard to get. There it is!

42
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:07,461
Do you want me to hook up with you
when you have nothing to do?

43
00:02:07,461 --> 00:02:12,341
That's it. When you have
nothing to do, you come and use me.

44
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:16,011
- Yeah...
- We use each other.

45
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,012
That's nice!

46
00:02:17,012 --> 00:02:18,931
- That's why we're here.
- I loved it.

47
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:20,599
I thought it was abusive.
Tell me more.

48
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,934
I use you, you use me.

49
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:24,228
I like when the person is honest, got it?

50
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:26,438
I like using people.
Am I going to like being used?

51
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:29,358
Let's get ready,
we're gonna go for drinks in one hour.

52
00:02:29,358 --> 00:02:31,402
Guys, João got married, right?

53
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:34,405
Oh, my God... He's married.

54
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:37,283
João's girl went to the house...

55
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:39,326
- Did she stay there?
- She's in the house.

56
00:02:39,326 --> 00:02:41,412
- She's one of them now.
- One more...

57
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:43,998
- Look at the makeup.
- So, is João in a romance?

58
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:46,917
Now that João's had sex,
he won't let her leave.

59
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,420
He'll say, "You're going
to stay here forever."

60
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,005
He'll send her away now.

61
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:53,215
Are they going to the party? Already?

62
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:56,594
It must be Saturday.
We can start earlier on Saturdays, right?

63
00:02:56,719 --> 00:03:00,514
Yeah... Makes sense.

64
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,480
I'm gonna do the lucky lick.
Excuse me.

65
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,649
Lucky lick. Wait, let me see. Sit there.

66
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,651
But I want to be lucky.

67
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:15,029
No, I told you.
João licked that girl's boobs.

68
00:03:15,029 --> 00:03:17,031
- Look.
- It really was that, look.

69
00:03:17,031 --> 00:03:20,117
What did I say in
the last episode? I said João would lose

70
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:22,661
his virginity
and would have sex a lot, see?

71
00:03:22,661 --> 00:03:23,996
That he would get loose.

72
00:03:23,996 --> 00:03:24,955
Yes.

73
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,416
I wonder if the chicks are going

74
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:30,252
to let him do what he wants
or if he became a friend...

75
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:31,795
No, she let him lick her boobs.

76
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:32,880
Girl...

77
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,257
I don't let
my girlfriends lick my nipples,

78
00:03:35,257 --> 00:03:38,135
but anyway... This could be a friend zone.

79
00:03:38,135 --> 00:03:39,637
He does that and shows off.

80
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:41,305
- João... He's handsome.
- He is.

81
00:03:41,305 --> 00:03:42,264
He's the hottest.

82
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:47,102
I don't find him handsome,
but I find him... He's a show-off.

83
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,938
I find him handsome.
He's a good kisser.

84
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:52,358
No, now my vibe has changed.
I'm digging Murilo now.

85
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:54,610
Fuck, man...
How long since you've been here?

86
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,737
How long haven't I been here?

87
00:03:56,737 --> 00:03:58,238
Man, about...

88
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:00,991
ten years.

89
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:02,576
Ten years since he's been on a beach.

90
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:04,078
I don't judge him...

91
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:05,162
Like my bank account.

92
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:06,497
...seen a positive balance.

93
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:08,207
I go to Rio three times a week.

94
00:04:08,207 --> 00:04:09,792
I just see it...

95
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:12,086
I've been living
in Rio and the last time

96
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:14,129
I got into the water
was about seven months ago.

97
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:17,091
From time to time,
it's good to salt your ass, but...

98
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:18,926
Poor Murilo, ten years without...

99
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:20,260
Salt your ass!

100
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,261
#SALTYOURASS

101
00:04:21,553 --> 00:04:24,515
From time to time, it's good to salt it,
but... You get breaded.

102
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:26,934
"Salt your ass," that's great.

103
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:34,274
I'm just stealing your... I'm warming up.

104
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,068
They're so cute.

105
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:38,612
It's not all about sex. You see?

106
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,489
It's already touching, did you see it?

107
00:04:40,489 --> 00:04:41,699
It's Carol.

108
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,035
It wants to say hello to you.
Stay put, fuck! Stop it!

109
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:48,330
It doesn't work when it has to.

110
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,791
- Jeez.
- He slapped her in the face?

111
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:52,292
I found it really aggressive.

112
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:56,296
Yeah, look, I think
they should kick him out of the house.

113
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:59,550
What do you guys think
about that slap, Bianca?

114
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:03,470
I thought it was abusive.
But they had a relationship...

115
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:07,641
It depends on the vibe.
He wasn't aggressive, he didn't go there.

116
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,518
Maybe that happened when they had sex...

117
00:05:09,518 --> 00:05:10,602
...but she didn't like it.

118
00:05:10,602 --> 00:05:11,603
She didn't.

119
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,522
- She made drama.
- That could happen at the bar.

120
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,190
In the bedroom is one thing...

121
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,192
She didn't like it.

122
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,069
You noticed she got kind of mad.

123
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:21,780
There's a pet peeve in a couple,

124
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,323
sometimes that happens.

125
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,618
- But she's wrong.
- He took a lot of makeup off of her face.

126
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,620
One time,
when I was talking, I was getting angry,

127
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:30,581
I said, "I don't know what..."

128
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,624
But in that situation, I don't know...

129
00:05:32,624 --> 00:05:36,336
You're not ridiculous. You're real.
I do this a lot, too. Sometimes...

130
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,422
Hit me again.

131
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,507
- I'm very cold, I swear...
- It's too cold.

132
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:42,926
I'm shaking.
I'm trying to drink, but I can't.

133
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:45,888
Bro, I got out of there
because something annoyed me.

134
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:47,056
What?

135
00:05:47,056 --> 00:05:49,683
Didn't you see Ramon slapping my face?

136
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:51,018
Slap your face?

137
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,188
- He was messing with you, right?
- Yeah, but...

138
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:57,232
I can't accept that, even if he was.

139
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,318
She's joking, right, guys?

140
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:02,738
She's upset.
She feels like she suffered an aggression.

141
00:06:02,738 --> 00:06:05,032
The man who slapped her...

142
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:06,533
Yes, he was messing around.

143
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,577
It was a little push. He was kidding.

144
00:06:08,577 --> 00:06:11,872
Let me say something.
We as men are stronger than women.

145
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,792
- It's obvious, man.
- One little slap became...

146
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:16,710
It was misinterpreted, maybe.

147
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:18,837
He didn't intend to...

148
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,589
She didn't... Yeah. Got it?

149
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,425
I'm not saying it's okay,
but she didn't allow that.

150
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:25,135
She let him know she didn't allow that.

151
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,137
- You think?
- All starts with a joke.

152
00:06:27,137 --> 00:06:30,849
How didn't she have intimacy with him?
She's talking about his dick...

153
00:06:30,849 --> 00:06:33,894
"Look, it works when it has to."
Do you want more intimacy?

154
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:37,439
Guys, a dick spanking
is very different from a real spanking.

155
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:43,112
It doesn't give him the right to...

156
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:45,072
Man, you slapped me in the face.

157
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:47,074
Come on, Nath.

158
00:06:47,074 --> 00:06:49,827
- You're not supposed to.
- Did I slap you hard?

159
00:06:49,827 --> 00:06:51,120
I didn't like it.

160
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,205
What if I did that to you?

161
00:06:53,205 --> 00:06:56,375
You did that to me many times.
You hit me three times in the gut

162
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,127
with your elbow. Three times.

163
00:06:58,127 --> 00:06:59,878
Should a man slap a woman in the face?

164
00:06:59,878 --> 00:07:02,381
- She flopped the situation.
- She flopped, baby.

165
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:05,259
If you apologized to me
and I accepted it, we're good.

166
00:07:05,259 --> 00:07:07,594
Yeah, man, she's a troublemaker.
That's bad.

167
00:07:07,594 --> 00:07:11,056
She picked a fight
and then filed her nails.

168
00:07:11,056 --> 00:07:12,724
You fucked up, huh, Nathalia?

169
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:15,394
She was filing her nails
and eating chicken.

170
00:07:15,394 --> 00:07:16,478
Big mistake.

171
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:17,813
I want to understand what

172
00:07:17,813 --> 00:07:20,065
"flop the situation" means.
I want to understand.

173
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:21,150
"To flop" means...

174
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:23,986
It's like "ruined."
"It didn't work out," got it?

175
00:07:23,986 --> 00:07:26,238
Like, "The person ruined my thing."

176
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:28,657
"I went to have sex
with Titto, and his dick is small."

177
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:30,659
He flopped the situation.
You flopped the sex.

178
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,411
You're not supposed to expose

179
00:07:32,536 --> 00:07:35,205
our intimacy here.
I've already told you. All right?

180
00:07:35,205 --> 00:07:37,040
It's like "ruined," "interrupted."

181
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,251
Pabllo, has anybody
ever flopped your thing?

182
00:07:39,251 --> 00:07:42,629
- Many times, but...
- The way John said?

183
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:46,758
Yeah, but I don't stop dreaming
about better days because of that.

184
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:50,053
Go, Cinderella from Bahia, Carla Perez.

185
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,097
I can't stand her look, man.

186
00:07:52,097 --> 00:07:53,891
No, look at her look, man.

187
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:55,851
She's absolute, right?

188
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:57,019
She stays here.

189
00:07:57,019 --> 00:08:01,440
Does anyone have a funny story
of a flopped situation? A story. Anyone?

190
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,649
Anyone?

191
00:08:02,649 --> 00:08:05,611
Carol! Carol! Carol!

192
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:08,572
- Carol, our oracle.
- About dick?

193
00:08:08,572 --> 00:08:09,907
A flopped situation.

194
00:08:09,907 --> 00:08:12,159
About a ruined situation by someone.

195
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:15,954
Because this person was late
or didn't have an invitation to the party.

196
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,414
Or he had a small dick.

197
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:20,042
We go to parties with friends,
then they fight

198
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:22,085
with each other, and I just leave.

199
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:24,504
Obviously, it's flopping the situation.

200
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:27,174
What about you?
Did anyone flop like this...

201
00:08:27,174 --> 00:08:29,092
Other than me? Small dick.

202
00:08:29,092 --> 00:08:32,763
Penis? Man, it doesn't happen
because I ask to send me a picture.

203
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:35,307
Once this happened, there was one time

204
00:08:35,307 --> 00:08:37,809
I hooked up with a guy,
when we got to my place.

205
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,603
We started making out, he said,

206
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:42,564
"I have to tell you a little thing,
but I'll do it later."

207
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,191
"A little thing" is great.

208
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:47,527
Then he said,
"I'm married. I have two kids."

209
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:52,282
"So, you have to leave, right?"
Then he came back, had sex and left.

210
00:08:52,282 --> 00:08:53,450
I didn't get it.

211
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:57,120
He said he was married, had two kids.
That was a flopped situation.

212
00:08:57,913 --> 00:08:59,623
- It was a flopped situation.
- I won, baby.

213
00:08:59,623 --> 00:09:01,166
What about you, Bianca?

214
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,627
Are you talking about fighting?

215
00:09:03,627 --> 00:09:05,879
- No, about flopping.
- It could be without...

216
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:09,925
Yes. The only time I used a dating app...

217
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:12,469
Tell us more, Bianca. The only time.

218
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:14,346
No, I like to know the person.

219
00:09:14,346 --> 00:09:17,432
If the talking is good,
I'll meet the person, got it?

220
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:20,811
The guy had a nice chatting style.
He used to make me laugh a lot.

221
00:09:20,811 --> 00:09:24,356
When we met, his voice was terrible.

222
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:27,567
And I care a lot about voices,
man, I don't know why.

223
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:30,320
Why didn't I ask him
to send me a voice message?

224
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:31,655
No WhatsApp at that time?

225
00:09:31,655 --> 00:09:32,572
What about the dick?

226
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,533
I chatted on WhatsApp,
but I didn't send...

227
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:35,951
What about the dick?

228
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:37,869
I didn't even get there, no.

229
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:40,038
-"What about the dick?
- It was disappointing.

230
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:41,665
It gobbled, babe.

231
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:43,417
I never used those apps anymore.

232
00:09:43,417 --> 00:09:46,169
What kind of voice do you like?
Like Mariano's?

233
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:49,131
- Who talks like this? Placing his voice...
- What about mine?

234
00:09:49,131 --> 00:09:51,508
No, girl, but...
His kind of voice is not...

235
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:55,095
- What about mine, Bia?
-"What about mine? Girl..."

236
00:09:55,095 --> 00:09:56,513
- What about mine?
- I love you.

237
00:09:56,513 --> 00:09:57,597
Thanks, girl.

238
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,599
Mariano, say something as if...

239
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,977
As if you were on an app and would send

240
00:10:01,977 --> 00:10:04,813
Bianca a voice message,
a girl who likes voices.

241
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,231
Let's do this.

242
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:11,528
How would Mariano send a voice message...

243
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:14,156
To Carol, dressed as money.
How would you send her a voice message?

244
00:10:14,156 --> 00:10:15,574
Fuck, my nipple got...

245
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:20,203
Carol, huh? Let's spend some money?

246
00:10:20,329 --> 00:10:22,289
- Oh, fuck.
- Let's do this.

247
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:24,833
- Look.
-"Let's do this." That's very good.

248
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,085
- Let's do this.
- Hey, stop it.

249
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:29,755
Fuck, seriously. That voice means sex.

250
00:10:29,755 --> 00:10:32,924
Hit play, I want to see this mess now.

251
00:10:33,342 --> 00:10:35,052
Fuck.

252
00:10:35,052 --> 00:10:36,762
- Got it?
- No.

253
00:10:36,762 --> 00:10:40,640
We were joking around, talking,
and he slapped me in the face.

254
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,770
I thought about hitting him back
at that moment. Anyway. I bounced...

255
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:49,816
Fuck, you're still into him?
Come on, Nathalia. Jesus Christ.

256
00:10:52,861 --> 00:10:54,988
Luan is defending me.

257
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,991
I'm defending you. Fuck, man.

258
00:10:57,991 --> 00:11:01,370
She's kind of an idiot,
I'm sorry to say that.

259
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:03,080
Murilo is going to talk to her.

260
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,624
- She's really being an asshole.
- Totally.

261
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:08,794
I think she was too quiet
in the last episodes,

262
00:11:08,794 --> 00:11:11,171
then she decided, "Today is the day."

263
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:13,799
Fuck, girl,
why did she say that to that boy?

264
00:11:13,799 --> 00:11:15,008
That's not necessary.

265
00:11:15,008 --> 00:11:17,344
If a friend of mine says,
"So-and-so slapped my face,"

266
00:11:17,344 --> 00:11:19,471
I'll think he slapped her in the face.

267
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:20,847
I would tell the guy,

268
00:11:20,847 --> 00:11:22,474
"Are you going
to slap her in the face?

269
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:24,309
Are you nuts?"
But that didn't happen.

270
00:11:24,309 --> 00:11:25,727
I would throw the TV...

271
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:30,273
He had already apologized.
He was kidding... Luan is shaken.

272
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:31,900
I think he's arguing.

273
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,527
Why are you looking at her this way?

274
00:11:33,527 --> 00:11:36,113
- That's the troublemaker.
- Look, he's dying to fight.

275
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:37,864
That's what I'm talking about.

276
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:39,533
Luan, stop it.

277
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:40,784
No way. He's pissed.

278
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:42,077
I'm devastated.

279
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:44,788
Get out of there, man. He soaked Thais.

280
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:47,249
- Luan, stop it...
- You piece of shit.

281
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:49,543
He spilled... The drink on the girl.

282
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:53,672
For Christ's sake, he soaked everybody
in here, soaked everybody but me.

283
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:55,924
Fuck you.

284
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:59,302
Come on, man. Hey, Luan...

285
00:11:59,428 --> 00:12:01,054
For Christ's sake, Luan.

286
00:12:01,054 --> 00:12:03,890
It takes four men to stop me.
You piece of shit.

287
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:07,811
Can't you deal with me on your own?
Show me you can deal with me alone.

288
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:11,064
Stop it, stop it! Please, don't do...

289
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,525
Who was the girl that...
It was Nathalia, right?

290
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:16,653
Yes. She's an asshole.

291
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:19,614
Luan was told she was attacked.

292
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:22,701
Do you guys think he did the right thing?

293
00:12:22,701 --> 00:12:27,372
- No. He was already upset.
- I think you can't retaliate an attack.

294
00:12:27,372 --> 00:12:29,207
A real man says, "Hey, pal, come here."

295
00:12:29,207 --> 00:12:30,167
Exactly.

296
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,419
No, wait, I understand his situation.

297
00:12:32,419 --> 00:12:35,589
He interfered even if that had
nothing to do with the situation.

298
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,341
I understand that... His resentment.

299
00:12:38,341 --> 00:12:39,968
The problem is that people...

300
00:12:39,968 --> 00:12:41,178
They want to talk under the influence.

301
00:12:41,178 --> 00:12:42,387
At the club...

302
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,306
But the way he talked to him, right?

303
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:46,683
I've already defended someone at a club.

304
00:12:46,683 --> 00:12:48,268
I've seen a guy beating a woman...

305
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:50,520
Me, too, I've already fought.

306
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,605
In that case, he was upset...

307
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:53,356
I don't drink and I've already seen this

308
00:12:53,356 --> 00:12:55,650
and I said, "Are you grabbing
this woman's arm?

309
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:57,944
If she wants to talk to you,
you don't have to grab her arm.

310
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:00,071
Let her go."
I've done this a lot of times.

311
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:02,365
I've already fought.
It's wrong to take it out,

312
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:07,746
but I understand. It's hard to see
someone close to you being attacked...

313
00:13:07,746 --> 00:13:09,581
It's...

314
00:13:09,581 --> 00:13:11,917
- It's inadmissible.
- Thanks.

315
00:13:11,917 --> 00:13:14,294
I think he should have talked to Ramon,

316
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,087
but he said, "What's the deal?"

317
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:18,423
He threatened him on the bus.
He was showing off.

318
00:13:18,423 --> 00:13:20,550
He was an asshole. A hooligan, got it?

319
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,510
Exactly.

320
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:23,220
Do you know who the aggressor was?

321
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:25,180
He was.
He wanted to fight in front of everybody.

322
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,389
Got it?

323
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:27,807
He wanted to be the hotshot...

324
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,268
I think he has feelings for Nath.

325
00:13:30,268 --> 00:13:32,854
Do you remember
he took care of her in the bedroom?

326
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:33,897
Remember that?

327
00:13:33,897 --> 00:13:35,899
I don't know what he's thinking,
but I don't agree.

328
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:38,985
He took care of her. He went there
and got mad, he was jealous of him.

329
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:40,820
He went there and defended her.

330
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,823
I wonder if he's just a good friend
or if he has ulterior motives.

331
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:44,908
Talking to her was wrong.

332
00:13:44,908 --> 00:13:47,994
She told Luan about being slapped
and didn't explain it to him.

333
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:49,621
- Exactly.
- No, it was wrong...

334
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:52,874
She didn't admit to him
what he'd said to her.

335
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:57,879
It was wrong to apologize
and leave unfinished business.

336
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:05,595
I'm sorry to tell you this.
But, to me, he's a man and you're a kid.

337
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:08,473
When a man realizes
someone is acting like a kid,

338
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:11,685
they take someone's side.
I'm sorry to tell you this.

339
00:14:11,685 --> 00:14:16,481
But, to me, today...
Today he's the greatest.

340
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:17,524
That's fair.

341
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:20,318
Do you know why? Because
he's got nothing to do with this.

342
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:23,655
He's got nothing to do with both of us.
And he defended me.

343
00:14:23,655 --> 00:14:25,490
I agree. That's true.

344
00:14:28,243 --> 00:14:30,704
And you also could be...

345
00:14:30,704 --> 00:14:32,247
I didn't behave well.

346
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:35,917
No, bro.
I wish I'd never met you. I swear.

347
00:14:35,917 --> 00:14:37,377
She humiliated that guy a lot.

348
00:14:37,377 --> 00:14:39,713
I think he's going to apologize...

349
00:14:39,713 --> 00:14:41,214
And he didn't say a thing.

350
00:14:41,214 --> 00:14:44,134
If he does that, he'll be a genius...

351
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:46,094
Because he's not that wrong.

352
00:14:46,094 --> 00:14:48,597
And he was scolded by her,
she'd rather not have met...

353
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:50,348
And he didn't... didn't answer.

354
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:52,559
Man, she broke his heart.

355
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:56,146
She couldn't have said that, man.
Yes, I'm very touched...

356
00:14:57,689 --> 00:14:58,982
She's sad. How unfortunate.

357
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:01,192
Imagine how many men
she deceived by crying crocodile tears.

358
00:15:01,192 --> 00:15:03,903
It's a valid lesson
because I think it's the moment...

359
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,697
But the context itself...

360
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:08,074
She made a mistake.

361
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:10,368
- Are you making fun?
- No, I'm very shaken.

362
00:15:10,368 --> 00:15:13,288
Do you think...
She's a crying crocodile. She's laughing.

363
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,457
- No.
- Yes, she has no emotions.

364
00:15:15,457 --> 00:15:17,917
But she's very unpredictable.

365
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,086
Carol, you're laughing, stop it!

366
00:15:20,086 --> 00:15:21,504
Carol is very unpredictable.
I don't want...

367
00:15:21,504 --> 00:15:23,340
I'm crying.

368
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:27,344
My little dollar bundle, stop it!

369
00:15:27,844 --> 00:15:30,847
Come eat, man. Sit, let's eat.

370
00:15:30,847 --> 00:15:35,602
Look at this tasty food I made you guys,
one big plate.

371
00:15:35,602 --> 00:15:38,688
I love you, my friend, you know?
You too, my friend.

372
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:41,816
I'm going to miss those hot nights
in the Tiger Room.

373
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,943
Jeez, I'm kind of sick of Luan now.

374
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,613
Now Luan is...
He's the man. He thinks he's the man.

375
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:49,491
- Look, you see? Look.
- You, too, my friend.

376
00:15:49,491 --> 00:15:52,243
If he stared at me like that,
I would headbutt him

377
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,496
three times.
What is he thinking, man?

378
00:15:54,621 --> 00:15:55,455
What?

379
00:15:55,455 --> 00:15:58,249
Something is going on at that table.

380
00:15:58,249 --> 00:16:00,418
He's making a bad boy face,
a hooligan face.

381
00:16:00,418 --> 00:16:02,629
That guy asked him to talk...

382
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:06,007
Get a clue, bro. Look, poor Ramon.

383
00:16:07,133 --> 00:16:09,552
He doesn't know what to do.
He was scolded.

384
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:10,970
- Yes.
- Yes.

385
00:16:11,096 --> 00:16:12,305
He was scolded.

386
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,351
He... wants to resolve nothing.

387
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:17,477
He wakes up the other day,

388
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:20,730
"Hey, sorry, I won't do this
anymore. My vibe is going to change."

389
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:22,107
- Yes.
- I hope so.

390
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:24,067
He's already done that.
He'll do it again.

391
00:16:34,744 --> 00:16:37,372
Look at that table,
it's a rich people's thing, right?

392
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:39,040
It's a soap opera thing.

393
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,459
I like that pool inside the house,
I want that.

394
00:16:42,794 --> 00:16:45,922
She's going to call someone now.
I want to see who she'll call.

395
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:47,006
Calling...

396
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,299
Call the sheriff!

397
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:50,260
Those who humble
themselves will be exalted.

398
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:54,013
- She's going to bring a boy.
- She's the devil.

399
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:55,807
- Hello?
- Hi.

400
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:58,476
- Look who's there.
- Are you okay?

401
00:16:58,476 --> 00:16:59,561
"Are you okay?"

402
00:16:59,561 --> 00:17:01,271
I am, what about you?

403
00:17:01,271 --> 00:17:06,526
Things are great,
but I need my crush over here, right?

404
00:17:06,526 --> 00:17:08,778
This house gets ugly without you.

405
00:17:08,778 --> 00:17:11,114
What? I thought
your vacation would be longer.

406
00:17:11,114 --> 00:17:13,158
I miss our parties and getting wasted...

407
00:17:13,158 --> 00:17:14,576
I'm coming, easy, honey!

408
00:17:14,576 --> 00:17:17,120
Embarrassing ourselves. Jeez.

409
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:20,081
Mariano,
what does "embarrassing yourself" mean?

410
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:23,042
Yeah. "Embarrassing yourself"
means to do something stupid.

411
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,711
- Fucking up.
- Making a scene?

412
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:25,962
No, at the moment...

413
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,464
Do you know "screwing up"?

414
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:29,549
- Yeah.
- Do you embarrass yourself, Pabllo?

415
00:17:29,549 --> 00:17:30,675
- Always.
- I love it.

416
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,260
What kind of embarrassment?

417
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,221
Falling down in heels,

418
00:17:35,221 --> 00:17:39,100
showing underwear unintentionally,
but who doesn't?

419
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:41,644
I don't show my underwear.

420
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,062
When I'm with my crush...

421
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:44,898
...show my Victoria's Secret underwear...

422
00:17:44,898 --> 00:17:46,107
He tears his pants at the club.

423
00:17:46,107 --> 00:17:47,859
She's bringing meat to a barbecue.

424
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:49,861
She's been in Floripa for 30 days.

425
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,279
Meat to a barbecue.

426
00:17:51,279 --> 00:17:52,655
She's bringing a skewer.

427
00:17:52,655 --> 00:17:55,241
She's bringing cake
to a birthday party.

428
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,243
She would have to go to a club...

429
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:58,953
Now she's bringing
another guy from her city?

430
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,079
She wants to tease him.

431
00:18:00,079 --> 00:18:03,917
Do you think she's bringing a guy that
she's already been intimate with to shock?

432
00:18:03,917 --> 00:18:05,418
Maybe the guy stays there

433
00:18:05,418 --> 00:18:08,463
and she gets stuck for the rest
of her vacation. She's stupid.

434
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:09,798
Send him away.

435
00:18:09,798 --> 00:18:12,050
Isn't it going to be cooler?

436
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,301
I hope he's very hot.

437
00:18:13,301 --> 00:18:15,386
Didn't you hear what she said?

438
00:18:15,386 --> 00:18:17,472
She said, "Those who
humble themselves will be exalted."

439
00:18:17,472 --> 00:18:19,557
She's doing that to tease Ramon.

440
00:18:19,557 --> 00:18:22,268
- To tease him.
- Exactly. It's Regina George.

441
00:18:22,268 --> 00:18:26,105
Do you know what's worse?
Ramon is very cute. He'll be hurt.

442
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:28,024
- Of course. Look.
- Look, look.

443
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:29,734
But he's a womanizer, right?

444
00:18:29,734 --> 00:18:31,569
Look, she takes initiative.

445
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:36,449
Do you know what's worse?
She felt she had the right to do that.

446
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,244
When you see the person
with someone else, you get hornier.

447
00:18:39,244 --> 00:18:41,704
That's great. I want
to see you with someone else.

448
00:18:41,704 --> 00:18:45,959
Ramon will be very horny if Nath really
called her crush, when he arrives, right?

449
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:49,003
The guy will hook up with her,
then he'll leave.

450
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,421
Do you want to bet those two...

451
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:52,257
He'll bounce. Ramon will go insane.

452
00:18:52,257 --> 00:18:55,176
- Or the boy could stay...
- He'll have to leave some time.

453
00:18:55,176 --> 00:18:56,594
Ramon could meet another person.

454
00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:58,805
Are you nuts?
You're being naive. He'll say,

455
00:18:58,805 --> 00:19:00,431
"Really? I'm going over there
to get laid."

456
00:19:00,431 --> 00:19:01,641
Ramon will hook up...

457
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:05,478
Then you look and say, "I'm upset," and
you don't care about that person anymore.

458
00:19:05,478 --> 00:19:09,357
- Anything can happen.
- Ramon is a womanizer.

459
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:12,485
Do you remember he was hitting on
that woman?

460
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:16,155
He's surely going
to hook up with another girl.

461
00:19:16,281 --> 00:19:17,490
Who, Ramon?

462
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,492
And both of them are going to be hornier.

463
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:24,956
We've talked a lot of times. But I think
this situation is not good for me.

464
00:19:24,956 --> 00:19:28,626
It's not that I don't want it,
just to make things clear...

465
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:30,503
Look him in the eyes, bro.

466
00:19:31,546 --> 00:19:35,300
But... I need some distance right now.

467
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,803
Right before the guy gets there,
because she called him. She's a snake.

468
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,096
Of course I noticed.

469
00:19:40,096 --> 00:19:45,518
But I need some time for me, because
this situation is making me feel bad.

470
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:49,522
I don't want the house
to get affected like it was.

471
00:19:49,522 --> 00:19:52,650
I want you to have your space,
that I have mine.

472
00:19:53,735 --> 00:19:58,239
You do whatever you want. I'll do
whatever I want, what I feel like doing.

473
00:19:58,239 --> 00:20:00,825
- Live your life.
- Exactly.

474
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,577
I noticed you were different and...

475
00:20:02,577 --> 00:20:04,829
I gave you some space,
even if you didn't talk to me.

476
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:08,583
- Poor Ramon.
- Come here, Ramon.

477
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,669
I totally understand.
I think, sometimes...

478
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:15,423
Although we liked each other,
we need some space...

479
00:20:15,423 --> 00:20:17,675
...when a person
doesn't look me in the eyes.

480
00:20:17,675 --> 00:20:18,635
Look me in the eyes.

481
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:21,387
I get upset when people
don't look me in the eyes.

482
00:20:21,387 --> 00:20:23,431
He was looking her
in the eyes all the time.

483
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,308
She didn't look. And she was speaking...

484
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:27,393
She knows what she wants to do.

485
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:30,563
She's being a snake, man.
Ramon is acting like a man.

486
00:20:30,563 --> 00:20:32,899
And she didn't tell that guy is...

487
00:20:32,899 --> 00:20:35,443
She looked him in the eyes
yesterday and said he was a child...

488
00:20:35,443 --> 00:20:37,570
He looked her in the eyes

489
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:39,614
and had a real talk with her again.

490
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:41,908
But Ramon is a womanizer, man.

491
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:44,911
Fuck it, he's a respectful womanizer.
Let him be it.

492
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,996
He hits on everybody.

493
00:20:46,996 --> 00:20:48,498
He can't hook up with other girls?

494
00:20:48,498 --> 00:20:50,375
He may be a good guy to women.

495
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,126
That's weird talk, let him be a womanizer.

496
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:54,087
What's the problem
with him being a womanizer?

497
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:57,006
- Guys, but I'm different.
- Why?

498
00:20:57,006 --> 00:20:58,007
Well...

499
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,760
Ramon is wrong? Really? What do you think?

500
00:21:00,760 --> 00:21:04,472
"I'm different.
I'm allowed to do it, I'm different."

501
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,766
Here's what I think.
He's really a womanizer,

502
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:09,102
but he wasn't her boyfriend.

503
00:21:09,102 --> 00:21:11,270
And what's the problem
with him being a womanizer?

504
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:13,231
There's a problem when you're committed.

505
00:21:13,231 --> 00:21:14,148
No.

506
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:15,066
Got it? He's really a womanizer.

507
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:16,609
I don't think that's a problem...

508
00:21:16,609 --> 00:21:17,652
That's it. Right.

509
00:21:17,652 --> 00:21:21,322
They had no relationship, they had
no deal, did they? I don't think so.

510
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,157
- No.
- They didn't.

511
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:25,994
But they respected each other, right?

512
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:26,953
Yes.

513
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:31,249
But this is different.
He's being honest now, and she isn't.

514
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:32,834
I think this is going to snowball...

515
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:34,252
From that moment she lied,

516
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:35,795
saying she had only told that chick.

517
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:38,256
She's not being honest with him.

518
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:41,634
Then she said all those things,
even if he's a womanizer...

519
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:44,595
I think he's right in that situation...

520
00:21:44,595 --> 00:21:46,973
- Of course.
- He's acting properly...

521
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:49,058
But I'm on his side.

522
00:21:52,603 --> 00:21:54,022
- Are you going upstairs?
- No.

523
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:56,107
- Let's talk.
- You're a pain in the ass...

524
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:57,859
Look. "I need to talk to you."

525
00:21:57,859 --> 00:21:59,360
Will you go with him?

526
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:00,987
I'm going to talk to Ramon.

527
00:22:01,112 --> 00:22:05,074
When I talked to Nath
about touching her face,

528
00:22:05,074 --> 00:22:09,787
I talked to her,
I apologized for what happened.

529
00:22:09,787 --> 00:22:12,290
Then I heard things escalated,

530
00:22:12,290 --> 00:22:14,625
with one person
telling the story to the next.

531
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:15,710
Exactly. I did.

532
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:20,465
I imagine you heard it like,
"Ramon hit Nathalia in the face."

533
00:22:20,465 --> 00:22:22,633
So I put myself in your shoes and wondered

534
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,761
how I'd deal with that.
I'd probably get mad.

535
00:22:24,886 --> 00:22:26,929
This guy is acting like a grown-up.

536
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,264
- Yeah, man.
- He really is.

537
00:22:28,264 --> 00:22:34,270
Yes. Let me tell you
some truths you might enjoy or not.

538
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,438
Sure.

539
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:39,108
I see her hurting. Bro, me and Bia...

540
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:43,988
I'm going to tell you what we have.
If she kisses somebody, I kiss, too.

541
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:45,323
We've talked about it.

542
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:48,493
But you don't let her
live her life. You have a...

543
00:22:48,493 --> 00:22:50,119
Luan has feelings for Nath.

544
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:55,166
You shield her, you know?
But you're not protecting her as a friend.

545
00:22:55,166 --> 00:22:56,751
Nath is very defenseless, Ramon.

546
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:59,796
He's judging their relationship
and his is, "If I kiss, you kiss, too."

547
00:22:59,796 --> 00:23:01,672
Really? Who called him, guys?

548
00:23:01,672 --> 00:23:04,092
But sometimes, I want to be with you.

549
00:23:04,092 --> 00:23:06,177
Then I'm forced
to hook up with another guy

550
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:08,137
because you hooked up with another girl.

551
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,180
That Luan, no...

552
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,681
I'm going to say something about Ramon.

553
00:23:10,681 --> 00:23:11,641
Now it's serious.

554
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:12,975
He was honest. He said,

555
00:23:12,975 --> 00:23:15,478
"I put myself in your shoes..."
He's trying...

556
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:17,897
Everyone heard
a story and told it differently...

557
00:23:17,897 --> 00:23:18,898
"...he slapped her."

558
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:21,359
He wasn't negligent

559
00:23:21,359 --> 00:23:24,654
at any moment. Then that guy wants
to take advantage of the situation.

560
00:23:24,654 --> 00:23:27,990
He wants to educate him,
use him as an example. What example?

561
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,951
- What example, baby?
- No, it's wrong.

562
00:23:29,951 --> 00:23:32,578
So what? Are you still in love with Luan?

563
00:23:32,578 --> 00:23:36,624
With Luan? My friend used to say,
"A blowjob is not a marriage."

564
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,877
A blowjob is not a marriage.

565
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:42,130
I'm hating him,
but I'd give him a blowjob.

566
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:44,257
"I'm hating him,
but I'd give him a blowjob."

567
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:46,092
- Obviously.
-"Obviously."

568
00:23:46,092 --> 00:23:48,302
Bro, I also make mistakes.
I'm not perfect.

569
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:50,429
Far from that.
I don't know if I want to be perfect.

570
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:51,973
We learn from mistakes.

571
00:23:51,973 --> 00:23:54,267
"I don't know if I want
to be perfect." Priceless.

572
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:56,435
"I hate being so perfect.
I don't know if I want it."

573
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,436
So many good things...

574
00:23:57,436 --> 00:24:01,232
Oh, my God. Excuse my beauty.

575
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:02,441
Wish you all the best.

576
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:03,401
To us. Amen...

577
00:24:03,401 --> 00:24:04,610
"Wish you all the best."

578
00:24:04,777 --> 00:24:07,530
I hope the mood here
gets back to what it was.

579
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:08,739
It's going to...

580
00:24:08,865 --> 00:24:12,118
If that depends on me, you know...
We ended this and, in time...

581
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:13,703
Booze separates, food reunites.

582
00:24:13,703 --> 00:24:17,039
Amen! We'll get back
into the groove in time.

583
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:19,041
We're going to be in sync again.

584
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,502
- Wish you all the best.
- Amen. We made it.

585
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:23,171
-"All the best"?
-"All the best."

586
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:24,297
No, man, that Luan...

587
00:24:24,297 --> 00:24:25,715
The most...

588
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,425
Luan thinks he's the best.

589
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:39,645
- I think her crush has just arrived.
- No way! It's him, of course.

590
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,439
I wonder if it's him.

591
00:24:41,439 --> 00:24:44,108
He's a great straight man, a manly man.

592
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:45,902
"He's a great straight man."

593
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:47,987
What's up, baby?

594
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:50,406
- What?
- Didn't you ask me to come?

595
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:52,825
That's not the correct way
to conjugate the verb.

596
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,535
He started making a Portuguese mistake.

597
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:55,703
Mauro is making this harder.

598
00:24:55,703 --> 00:24:57,580
Sorry, it was stronger than me.

599
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,832
This is Mauro, Blondie.

600
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,542
How are you? Nice to meet you.

601
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:04,253
- Can I drink this?
- Are you going to mix us some cocktails?

602
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:06,339
Yes, coming right up.

603
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:11,344
I said the invitation...
Were you nervous? You don't need to be.

604
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:14,347
- Jeez!
- He's full of himself.

605
00:25:14,347 --> 00:25:17,308
- She's a little shaken, did you feel it?
- It's normal, right?

606
00:25:17,308 --> 00:25:19,393
Girl, I found him very cute.

607
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:23,940
I don't know, I want to see him...
his height. I don't like short guys.

608
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,817
Less than 5'3" is friendship.

609
00:25:26,817 --> 00:25:29,070
You? When you see a short guy... What?

610
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:31,906
You have to play
in the NBA to date me. For starters, okay?

611
00:25:31,906 --> 00:25:34,033
Your boyfriend has to play in the NBA.

612
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:37,620
You need money and determination
to date me, we'll figure out the rest.

613
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:41,832
You have to be cool to date me.
You have to tell bad jokes.

614
00:25:41,832 --> 00:25:44,377
Don't you know any bad jokes?

615
00:25:44,377 --> 00:25:45,878
I'm fucked.

616
00:25:45,878 --> 00:25:47,004
Titto...

617
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:49,632
What did the duck tell the lagoon?

618
00:25:49,632 --> 00:25:53,135
This is a very bad joke.
I want a bad joke that's good.

619
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:54,887
No... It's me.

620
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,098
- Now it's her turn.
- One Aperol?

621
00:25:57,098 --> 00:25:58,057
Two Sex on the Beach.

622
00:25:58,057 --> 00:26:00,226
That boy is going to stay there?

623
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,311
Yeah, until she's off the clock.

624
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,862
- I missed you!
- I missed you, man.

625
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:16,617
- It's good to see a familiar face.
- Familiar...

626
00:26:16,617 --> 00:26:18,995
- Oh, my God.
- I missed you.

627
00:26:18,995 --> 00:26:21,247
I wonder if somebody will cry tonight.

628
00:26:21,455 --> 00:26:23,332
- Yes... A lot.
- Who? Ramon?

629
00:26:27,461 --> 00:26:30,172
- Guys...
- They're already kissing?

630
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:32,425
He went there for that.

631
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:35,803
- She's at work, man.
- Gaia left.

632
00:26:35,803 --> 00:26:39,098
I've never seen those people here
in São Paulo. Where do they live?

633
00:26:39,223 --> 00:26:40,933
- Who?
- Those guys.

634
00:26:40,933 --> 00:26:45,479
- Get out of here, man. Shut up.
- You're jealous.

635
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:47,565
- Stop being jealous.
- I don't like it.

636
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:49,525
I'll be a happy worker.

637
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,569
Take your hand off my leg, it's yours.

638
00:26:51,694 --> 00:26:53,029
Okay, no problem.

639
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:55,823
That table over there needs service.

640
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:58,075
- Jeez!
- Man, she was scolded.

641
00:26:58,075 --> 00:27:01,746
- Yeah, she's at work.
- Of course. She deserved it.

642
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:04,081
Because...

643
00:27:04,081 --> 00:27:06,208
Ouch, now things are going to get ugly.

644
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:10,254
Ramon was clear he's going
to live his life and it's all right.

645
00:27:10,254 --> 00:27:12,298
Look at what's written on Luan's shirt.

646
00:27:14,592 --> 00:27:19,513
- What's up, guys?
- It says... "I am positive energy."

647
00:27:19,513 --> 00:27:21,932
I want to see him
fighting wearing that shirt.

648
00:27:24,727 --> 00:27:26,812
- She grabbed his hand.
- See?

649
00:27:26,812 --> 00:27:28,022
How lame.

650
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:29,482
Obviously, Titto.

651
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:32,276
That's bad. Bro, Ramon is cool, really.

652
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:34,028
I'm already a big fan of Ramon.

653
00:27:34,028 --> 00:27:35,029
Yes, he's cute.

654
00:27:35,029 --> 00:27:36,572
He's the nicest person.

655
00:27:36,697 --> 00:27:38,908
I want him to ignore her
so she says, "What?"

656
00:27:38,908 --> 00:27:41,369
Yeah, I want him
to ignore her, bro. Really.

657
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:43,996
- Let's do this!

658
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:45,623
- What's up?
- How are you?

659
00:27:45,623 --> 00:27:47,750
- I'm great.
- Somebody is calling you.

660
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:49,710
- Treat him like a brother.
- Sure.

661
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:52,588
- Welcome.
- Man, nice to meet you. Thanks.

662
00:27:58,302 --> 00:28:01,305
He's my friend for all moments.
He wakes up with me.

663
00:28:02,139 --> 00:28:05,893
She kissed in front of him.
That's bad, huh?

664
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:08,771
But Ramon reacted really well.
He didn't do anything.

665
00:28:08,771 --> 00:28:12,608
He's great, but I want to see what's
going to happen when he starts to drink.

666
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:15,653
Fuck, bro, I hope Ramon hooks up
with a hot babe tonight, man.

667
00:28:15,653 --> 00:28:19,115
If that depended on me, Ramon would
hook up with Gisele Bündchen tonight.

668
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:26,789
This is fucked up... This kills the mood.

669
00:28:26,789 --> 00:28:28,666
There's not going to be trouble tonight.

670
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:30,251
Everyone will be upset.

671
00:28:30,251 --> 00:28:32,169
I think there isn't going to be.

672
00:28:32,169 --> 00:28:34,004
I think everyone will be upset.

673
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:38,092
- Man, Ramon did very well.
- He was elegant.

674
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:40,469
I told you João had lost his virginity.

675
00:28:40,469 --> 00:28:43,472
He's with that girl at the bar.
Did you see it?

676
00:28:43,472 --> 00:28:45,307
- It's another one?
- Another one.

677
00:28:45,307 --> 00:28:46,517
Jeez, bro!

678
00:28:47,017 --> 00:28:49,437
- No harm at all.
- No...

679
00:28:50,771 --> 00:28:52,773
I won't harm you at all.

680
00:28:52,773 --> 00:28:54,400
I hope so.

681
00:29:01,031 --> 00:29:02,825
I don't believe it.

682
00:29:04,493 --> 00:29:06,287
Look at Nath, man... With...

683
00:29:06,412 --> 00:29:08,539
- Girl...
- Call the other one, Nath.

684
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:11,959
Look at Ramon,
drinking to forget with a pint.

685
00:29:12,835 --> 00:29:16,088
- What a hot boy, oh, my God.

686
00:29:16,088 --> 00:29:18,799
- What a beautiful ass!
- That's a beautiful ass!

687
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:21,302
- Man, you're kidding me.
- Short guys are wonderful.

688
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:23,512
- Beautiful ass!
- They had sex before.

689
00:29:23,512 --> 00:29:26,015
Yeah, they've been
hooking up for a long time.

690
00:29:26,015 --> 00:29:28,517
Is anybody here? Nobody is in here.

691
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:29,852
Yes...

692
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:33,939
The couple from Goiás. They've already
slept here. Leave them alone.

693
00:29:38,486 --> 00:29:40,029
Our bedroom is huge, bro.

694
00:29:40,029 --> 00:29:41,655
There's João. See?

695
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:43,908
Is João going to do an orgy?

696
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:46,494
- Damn, Titto, it's true.
- Look at João, man.

697
00:29:46,702 --> 00:29:48,370
Guys, João has grown on me now.

698
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,748
- Has it ever happened to any of you?
- Never.

699
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:52,166
I don't want to know about this.

700
00:29:52,166 --> 00:29:54,210
Look at Mariano. Press pause.

701
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:56,795
Has it ever happened
when you were having sex...

702
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:58,964
- And somebody opened the door?
- Yes...

703
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:01,133
I was once in a motel, I had just eaten

704
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:03,552
and I was taking my tray
outside the bedroom...

705
00:30:03,552 --> 00:30:07,556
So they could take it away. The bedroom
in front left the door opened...

706
00:30:07,681 --> 00:30:09,517
Who leaves the door open?

707
00:30:09,517 --> 00:30:15,105
The door was left ajar. They might've
tried to shut it. Then I heard, "Oh! Oh!"

708
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:16,232
Curious...

709
00:30:16,232 --> 00:30:19,360
It was a gay couple.
I said, "Can I join you?"

710
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,070
They let me in...

711
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:23,030
- Did you?
- What did you do?

712
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:25,574
Obviously. I had just had dinner,
I was bloated.

713
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:28,577
But if everybody agreed...

714
00:30:28,577 --> 00:30:30,246
But was it good?

715
00:30:30,246 --> 00:30:31,914
You were well-fed, that's great...

716
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:32,873
He did.

717
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,375
...I didn't want trouble.

718
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:36,001
I wonder if this happens in real life.

719
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:37,378
Would you take a look at that?

720
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,838
But everyone was going to look.

721
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,799
- I wouldn't look, guys.
- You wouldn't?

722
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:43,342
Would you guys have sex...

723
00:30:43,342 --> 00:30:45,052
Seeing someone by my side

724
00:30:45,052 --> 00:30:46,178
having sex would be such a turn on.

725
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:47,429
I want that scene...

726
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:50,349
I wouldn't look.

727
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:52,393
I would do it beautifully...

728
00:30:52,393 --> 00:30:54,728
- Only if I was wasted.
- I've never done that.

729
00:30:54,728 --> 00:30:57,314
- Have you ever done this?
- No... If you ask me...

730
00:30:57,314 --> 00:31:01,026
Pabllo! Tell the truth.
Have you ever had sex next to anybody?

731
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:02,903
- No.
- Really?

732
00:31:02,903 --> 00:31:05,906
Didn't I just say I would?
If I'd done it...

733
00:31:05,906 --> 00:31:09,368
- Mariway?
- During holidays, being single...

734
00:31:09,368 --> 00:31:11,287
No. Have you done this?

735
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:14,164
As single
as a one-legged person's slipper.

736
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:16,417
Are you going to
say you wouldn't do it?

737
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:18,127
I love his catchphrases.

738
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:19,336
You're in a...

739
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:22,047
I'm talking about the past,
not the future.

740
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,966
So... If I've done it?
Yes, I have.

741
00:31:23,966 --> 00:31:25,551
Have you had sex next to somebody?

742
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:27,094
In a summer house, with friends...

743
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:28,971
Everybody in the same house, sure.

744
00:31:28,971 --> 00:31:31,015
- Then there's modão...
- Could you get it up?

745
00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:32,016
Sure.

746
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:39,481
She's wasted, wants to show off. Fuck.

747
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:41,233
Murilo, fuck you.

748
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:43,277
- Fuck you, bro.
- Fuck you.

749
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:46,864
You're wasted and wants to show off.
We know... Everything you did.

750
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:48,907
Someone sensible. Thanks, Murilo!

751
00:31:50,075 --> 00:31:51,827
- Jeez!
- Oh, fuck!

752
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:54,163
Oh, my God, that's my dream!

753
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,415
- Get out of here, John!
- Guys...

754
00:31:56,665 --> 00:31:58,792
I'm so going to spank
the monkey watching this.

755
00:31:58,792 --> 00:32:00,753
- Shut up! Don't say that!
- I'm sorry.

756
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:03,130
That's inappropriate.

757
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:05,257
She called that guy,

758
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:09,928
fucked him, it wasn't good
because she's complaining, wanting...

759
00:32:10,304 --> 00:32:12,890
He's going after her,
and she's flirting with Ramon...

760
00:32:13,057 --> 00:32:14,141
She's upset, look.

761
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:16,226
That's it, baby, you reap what you sow!

762
00:32:16,226 --> 00:32:18,896
You get what you give, Nathália.

763
00:32:22,733 --> 00:32:25,194
I think she's feeling bad...

764
00:32:25,986 --> 00:32:27,112
That's it, right, guys?

765
00:32:27,112 --> 00:32:30,783
She tried to do what Taynara did.
And it backfired.

766
00:32:30,783 --> 00:32:32,409
She got fucked up.

767
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,537
I think it's funny to see that, right?
How people behave.

768
00:32:35,537 --> 00:32:36,830
Because we are like that.

769
00:32:37,247 --> 00:32:38,832
That's real life.

770
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:42,044
ON THE NEXT EPISODE

771
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:43,879
I wonder if she'll catch the guy in bed.

772
00:32:43,879 --> 00:32:46,048
Ouch, she's drunk, she's going... Oh.

773
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:49,176
- I can't believe she did that!
- Look... You see?

774
00:32:49,176 --> 00:32:52,429
- That's what I'm saying
- Jeez, man, she's clueless, dude.

775
00:32:52,429 --> 00:32:55,641
She has something that doesn't exist
anymore, she needs to have good sense.
