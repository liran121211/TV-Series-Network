WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS
THE REVIEW

2
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:22,982
- The last episode, guys.
- The last episode.

3
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:24,859
It's not the last.

4
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:25,776
I'm sorry, success...

5
00:00:25,776 --> 00:00:28,112
Amazon, invite me for the next season.

6
00:00:28,112 --> 00:00:29,363
I'm in mourning.

7
00:00:29,363 --> 00:00:31,782
Remember that there was a mess
in the last episode.

8
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:32,783
It almost ended in a rumble.

9
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:33,701
Yes, gossip.

10
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:36,036
In short, Ramon broke up with Nath again.

11
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:36,954
That's something new.

12
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:40,291
Because he found out she gave someone
a peck in the afterparty.

13
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,251
Gossip, right?

14
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:43,210
It's time, boys.

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:44,462
We're very anxious.

16
00:00:44,462 --> 00:00:45,713
It's the last episode.

17
00:00:47,423 --> 00:00:48,883
Has everyone memorized this yet?

18
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:52,970
Ramon!

19
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:56,182
I can't wave my hand, girl.

20
00:00:56,182 --> 00:00:57,183
I'm going to stay here.

21
00:00:57,892 --> 00:00:59,143
Cool, calm and collected.

22
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:00,227
I loved the earrings.

23
00:01:01,562 --> 00:01:04,398
Has anybody kept score on the sex deals?

24
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,942
- João is the winner. Certainly.
- João.

25
00:01:12,656 --> 00:01:15,284
I've grown to like them.
I want to be their friend.

26
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:21,832
Did you like the drink?

27
00:01:21,832 --> 00:01:22,750
It's wonderful.

28
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:24,710
It was made with love and affection.

29
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,295
- Yeah? Really?
- I swear.

30
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:27,880
Holy shit!

31
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,216
I wish I were that girl.
I'd answer João...

32
00:01:30,216 --> 00:01:31,509
What would you say, Pabllo?

33
00:01:31,634 --> 00:01:33,260
Come and ask about my drink.

34
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:35,888
Pabllo, did you like this drink?

35
00:01:35,888 --> 00:01:37,723
It's your job to do it, baby.

36
00:01:39,183 --> 00:01:41,894
- Do it tomorrow?
- Tomorrow, brother, no...

37
00:01:41,894 --> 00:01:42,853
There's nothing right now.

38
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:45,523
Man, tomorrow we're having
a boat party here.

39
00:01:46,065 --> 00:01:48,943
There's going to be a lot of babes,
just the local girls.

40
00:01:48,943 --> 00:01:50,861
It's going to be great. Wanna go?

41
00:01:50,861 --> 00:01:52,988
Yeah, man.

42
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:55,616
There's a party invitation going on, look.

43
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:56,826
A boat party.

44
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:58,035
I'm scared.

45
00:01:58,035 --> 00:01:59,203
That's good, right?

46
00:01:59,203 --> 00:02:02,748
They were invited to a boat party,
but he doesn't have a boat.

47
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,625
We were invited and we're coming.

48
00:02:04,625 --> 00:02:07,127
- Are you nuts...
- What boat?

49
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:10,422
They'll go in someone else's boat?
Because they don't have one.

50
00:02:10,422 --> 00:02:12,800
It's about having a friend who has a boat.

51
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:13,801
Yeah...

52
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:17,513
- It's good being friends with a boat guy.
- Having a boat is a nightmare.

53
00:02:17,513 --> 00:02:19,348
I wouldn't want that.

54
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:22,226
After my shift, I want to talk to you...

55
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,061
You've always said good things about me.

56
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,063
After you're done, we'll talk...

57
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:27,147
He's going to ask.

58
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,649
People are working, may I?

59
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,442
Never put off anything you can do now.

60
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:31,735
Let's say it right now.

61
00:02:31,735 --> 00:02:32,653
Here's the thing.

62
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:35,990
I was invited with all the guys
to take a boat ride tomorrow.

63
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,867
There's going to be a party.

64
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:41,495
There's going to be a lot of boats...

65
00:02:41,495 --> 00:02:44,415
A ride on the high seas with the gang.

66
00:02:44,415 --> 00:02:46,625
But we don't have a boat, you do.

67
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:48,544
I can't believe he's doing this.

68
00:02:48,544 --> 00:02:51,547
And I'd like to propose some way

69
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:56,218
of paying you back, working for you...

70
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:57,970
The nerve of you guys!

71
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,806
- For us to enjoy our...
- You want my boat again?

72
00:03:00,806 --> 00:03:02,391
You can come as well.

73
00:03:02,391 --> 00:03:05,060
"You can come." The nerve.

74
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,353
I have an appointment
at the end of the day,

75
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,898
- not the whole day.
- Okay. Right.

76
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:10,858
- I'll need it by evening.
- Deal.

77
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:11,901
- Cool?
- Cool.

78
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:15,404
- We'll use it in the morning.
- You're the best boss in the world.

79
00:03:15,404 --> 00:03:17,990
Ramon, I'm not lending it to you,
but to João.

80
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,241
Oh, fuck!

81
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:20,868
In your face, well done.

82
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,077
He must've watched

83
00:03:22,077 --> 00:03:24,872
that episode
where they call him a son of a bitch.

84
00:03:27,458 --> 00:03:31,003
One for all, all for one!

85
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,806
People arrived.

86
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:45,809
That's the guy
who was in the house yesterday.

87
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:48,103
Last week, in that mess.

88
00:03:48,103 --> 00:03:49,730
They're the guys who were in that mess.

89
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,024
What is Nathalia doing? She's loving it.

90
00:03:52,024 --> 00:03:53,025
She's laughing.

91
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:55,069
Look at Nathalia's face. Again, Luan.

92
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:56,236
Hang in there, Luan.

93
00:03:56,236 --> 00:04:00,908
Guys, did you see Nathalia's face?

94
00:04:00,908 --> 00:04:02,284
Nathalia? No.

95
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:03,827
- In a flash...
- Yeah.

96
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:05,913
Nathalia is dying to cause trouble.

97
00:04:05,913 --> 00:04:08,332
That girl really is a troublemaker.

98
00:04:08,332 --> 00:04:09,708
She knows there will be trouble.

99
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:10,960
I think, look...

100
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,003
- Nathalia celebrated, did you feel it?
- Yes.

101
00:04:13,003 --> 00:04:15,214
- Very much.
- The fire in her eyes.

102
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:16,966
...there was going to be a lot of trouble.

103
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:20,260
Look, fight in the house, okay.
The house isn't mine, I'll leave.

104
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:22,262
But fighting at the party is so wrong.

105
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,723
It's make it or break it, honey.

106
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:27,351
Do you want a kiss?

107
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:29,853
It's Blondie with her boyfriend.

108
00:04:30,938 --> 00:04:33,732
-"I take care of you."
- She wants to have sex again.

109
00:04:33,732 --> 00:04:35,526
No. She wants to have sex now.

110
00:04:35,526 --> 00:04:38,070
She's right, they cockblocked her.

111
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,029
It's true.

112
00:04:39,029 --> 00:04:42,950
Thais rules the world,
and we're her servants.

113
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:47,663
Nath kissed him...

114
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,168
What is this guy doing here?

115
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:56,922
I asked him to dance.
The box is yours and mine, too.

116
00:04:57,381 --> 00:04:59,925
She put the guy inside the box, brother.

117
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:01,802
It was Nath who did the inviting.

118
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,804
Didn't I say this girl is a troublemaker?

119
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,931
He asked, "What is this guy doing here?"

120
00:05:05,931 --> 00:05:07,891
In theory, the box was everybody's.

121
00:05:07,891 --> 00:05:09,935
She said, "I invited him.
The box is mine too."

122
00:05:09,935 --> 00:05:14,106
She put that guy from the mess
in the box next to the guy who...

123
00:05:14,106 --> 00:05:15,315
But did she kiss him?

124
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:17,943
Guys, wait, wait, wait.

125
00:05:17,943 --> 00:05:20,779
Those guys put a lot of women
in the box at all parties.

126
00:05:20,779 --> 00:05:22,489
But no one had fought with...

127
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,825
John, you, too, go fuck yourself.

128
00:05:24,825 --> 00:05:26,410
- Fuck you.
- Who's going today?

129
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:28,412
After all, she just wanted to be with him.

130
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:31,248
The one in the black shirt
and checkered scarf

131
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:32,124
threatened him.

132
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:34,084
He said, "Do you have a problem?

133
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:35,586
"Do you wanna face me?"

134
00:05:35,586 --> 00:05:36,962
Nath is hooking up with the guy
wearing white shirt.

135
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,422
I want Nath to fuck off.

136
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:40,466
- Stop it.
- Stop the bullshit, Felipe.

137
00:05:40,466 --> 00:05:41,675
That girl is a jerk.

138
00:05:41,675 --> 00:05:42,718
Stop it now.

139
00:05:42,718 --> 00:05:44,595
I'm mad at that girl, for real.

140
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:47,306
- Let me tell you something...
- Get a grip. Childish.

141
00:05:47,306 --> 00:05:48,223
#CHILDISH

142
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,183
Childish.

143
00:05:49,183 --> 00:05:51,977
You're hooking up with some guy.

144
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,729
His friend was looking for trouble.

145
00:05:53,729 --> 00:05:56,023
You can't be with him.

146
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,232
Don't curse because it's wrong.

147
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:58,942
But she broke up with Ramon?

148
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,444
But that's not the problem.

149
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,738
If she broke up or not...

150
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:05,574
I don't like Boca Rosa,
because I don't like her.

151
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:06,533
She wears pink lipstick...

152
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,410
I prefer red, there you go.

153
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:11,705
Yesterday I almost fought with her,
I called her names.

154
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:13,791
Are you gonna put her beside me?
On purpose?

155
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:15,375
There's going to be trouble.

156
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,377
You have to avoid that. It's common sense.

157
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:19,379
- It's common sense.
- Common sense.

158
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:21,965
- Is Nathalia being an asshole?
- Everyone agrees?

159
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:25,886
Everyone but John Drops.
He's the one who likes to complain here.

160
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:28,555
Man, she could even hook up with the guy.

161
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:31,934
She could do it outside the box, you know?

162
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:34,520
We talked too much. Press play.

163
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,607
God...

164
00:06:38,607 --> 00:06:40,400
Is this the afterparty?

165
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:42,277
I think it is.

166
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,489
Really? Look...

167
00:06:45,489 --> 00:06:48,158
- The same guys again?
- Two...

168
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:51,495
That's not possible.
Look, that dude came in.

169
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:55,249
The one Nath is hooking up with is cool.
This one is the asshole.

170
00:06:55,249 --> 00:06:57,292
...me and Bia.

171
00:06:58,252 --> 00:06:59,128
Nathalia!

172
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:00,587
Everything is a mess.

173
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,089
Me and you.

174
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:06,301
Let's play. Nath, pay them back.
We have to make him lose.

175
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:07,511
It was my turn, right?

176
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:08,846
Hey...

177
00:07:09,221 --> 00:07:10,639
High five, fuck.

178
00:07:11,098 --> 00:07:12,766
I'm here to work hard.

179
00:07:12,766 --> 00:07:14,059
Don't smell my neck.

180
00:07:14,059 --> 00:07:17,646
But the guy she was kissing at the party
went with her, now she's with...

181
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:18,689
There he is, look.

182
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:19,898
She's flirting with Ramon.

183
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:21,567
Jeez, look at his face...

184
00:07:21,567 --> 00:07:23,235
- I'll remain quiet.
- Me, too.

185
00:07:23,235 --> 00:07:25,487
Look at him, he's eating like a lord.

186
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:26,905
Stop it, guys.

187
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:28,448
Almost hanging himself with the scarf.

188
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:32,286
Did Nath bring that guy
she hooked up with?

189
00:07:32,411 --> 00:07:35,497
She's now flirting with Ramon,
and the boy is eating peanuts.

190
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:36,665
That's it.

191
00:07:36,665 --> 00:07:37,916
Just watching.

192
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,209
Man, she does that...

193
00:07:39,209 --> 00:07:41,920
Have you noticed
she does that to every boy?

194
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,513
Has this ever happened to you?

195
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:52,848
- Never.
- Abandoned.

196
00:07:52,848 --> 00:07:54,558
I'm going to get it for you.

197
00:07:56,351 --> 00:07:58,187
Man, you're wasted.

198
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,065
- I'm going to go.
- Already?

199
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,400
- I'm beat.
- Okay...

200
00:08:04,193 --> 00:08:05,611
- No.
- Nath, I'm leaving.

201
00:08:05,611 --> 00:08:07,070
Bia, I'm winning.

202
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:08,655
I came to say goodbye.

203
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:12,242
Take care.

204
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:13,911
Good to see you.

205
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:16,121
- That's true.
- Write down my number.

206
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:17,623
Oh, no. Are you kidding?

207
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:21,543
- What a prince.
- Jeez, I swear.

208
00:08:21,710 --> 00:08:24,213
- He's like a businessman.
- He looks like he's bad in bed.

209
00:08:24,213 --> 00:08:25,130
Stop it.

210
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,298
What?

211
00:08:26,298 --> 00:08:28,675
"Businessman" is allowed?
And bad in bed is not?

212
00:08:28,675 --> 00:08:30,719
You say men stick together, right?

213
00:08:30,719 --> 00:08:32,012
I see now.

214
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:35,766
I wonder if she never really had
feelings for Ramon.

215
00:08:35,766 --> 00:08:37,309
What? Do you doubt, bro?

216
00:08:37,309 --> 00:08:39,436
- She was just horny.
- Are you kidding?

217
00:08:39,561 --> 00:08:41,730
Yeah, man. She even said that to him...

218
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:43,941
- I won't forget that thing.
- What a whore.

219
00:08:44,066 --> 00:08:47,110
"I regret I met you.
You're a piece of shit, a brat.

220
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:48,487
"The man who acts like a man..."

221
00:08:48,487 --> 00:08:49,404
I think...

222
00:08:49,404 --> 00:08:53,992
She didn't mean it, but it was hurtful.
Could've hurt him a lot, man.

223
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:57,496
The feeling she has for him is possession.
She thinks she owns him.

224
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:59,081
She thinks she owns everybody.

225
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:01,625
Literally, she doesn't make up her mind.

226
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,378
She says one thing and does another.

227
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:07,673
Bianca, it was worse saying those things

228
00:09:07,673 --> 00:09:09,007
- she didn't mean.
- Yeah...

229
00:09:09,007 --> 00:09:09,925
I think so, too.

230
00:09:09,925 --> 00:09:12,219
She wanted to hurt him on purpose.

231
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:14,972
Girl, you were a total fucking loser.

232
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:16,765
- She was, yesterday.
- What? Why?

233
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,601
You have to make up your mind.
You brought the dude

234
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,478
to be with you, and abandoned him.

235
00:09:21,478 --> 00:09:22,396
He left.

236
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:25,023
- You abandoned him to stalk Ramon.
- You were ignoring him.

237
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:25,983
I was playing.

238
00:09:25,983 --> 00:09:29,444
No. You were stalking Ramon.
You abandoned him to chase another one.

239
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:32,948
And you said, "I don't want anything."

240
00:09:32,948 --> 00:09:34,074
Come on.

241
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:36,451
Fuck you. I won't say anything anymore.

242
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:39,079
Don't ask for my opinion anymore.

243
00:09:40,205 --> 00:09:42,624
Hey, Thais is right, you know?

244
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:44,126
- Fuck no!
- She is.

245
00:09:44,126 --> 00:09:46,086
He didn't go after her, man.

246
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:47,879
She even hooked up with another guy.

247
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:49,006
She hooked up with him there.

248
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,675
She brought the guy to her house.

249
00:09:51,675 --> 00:09:53,176
She hooked up with that guy,

250
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,095
took him home
and hooked up with Ramon.

251
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,305
He didn't...

252
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:58,015
Ramon saw her with the blond guy.

253
00:09:58,015 --> 00:09:59,933
That's what I'm talking about.

254
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:01,393
- No, it's time...
- Fuck it.

255
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:02,811
It's time Nathalia and Ramon...

256
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:04,396
Ramon doesn't do what she does.

257
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:06,231
- It's time...
- Yeah.

258
00:10:06,231 --> 00:10:07,524
Let's see what happens.

259
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:09,318
It's time Nathalia made up her mind.

260
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:11,528
I think there's going to be a fight.

261
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:12,696
Did I chase her tonight?

262
00:10:12,696 --> 00:10:14,489
I'm talking about the other parties.

263
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:15,449
He didn't even care

264
00:10:15,449 --> 00:10:16,491
about her tonight.

265
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,702
- Not tonight.
- She was after him.

266
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,412
- Me?
- Yes, girl.

267
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:22,497
- Me?
- You were after him here, girl.

268
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:25,334
Your boy left
because you said you were after him.

269
00:10:25,334 --> 00:10:27,336
Jeez, Nathalia was an asshole.

270
00:10:27,336 --> 00:10:28,712
It's like what he said...

271
00:10:28,712 --> 00:10:33,383
I've lost track of how many times
those guys said she was an asshole.

272
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,594
She doesn't listen to anyone.

273
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:38,513
When she drinks, she gets worse.

274
00:10:38,513 --> 00:10:42,225
- Man, if she dated Luan...
- Jeez.

275
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:45,937
...they would fight all the time
because she would make things up.

276
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:49,191
I feel like picking this lamp up
and throwing it in your face.

277
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,443
But I was acting unconsciously.

278
00:10:51,443 --> 00:10:53,320
She said "Unconsciously."

279
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:57,574
- Look.
- Girl, stop blaming the booze, you know?

280
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,242
She's that kind of girl, right?

281
00:10:59,242 --> 00:11:02,913
I'm fucked up if I blame the booze
for everything I did wrong.

282
00:11:03,038 --> 00:11:05,749
She's been like this
since episode one. Until now.

283
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:07,084
This is not booze.

284
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:08,335
Booze is temporary.

285
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:11,546
That's one of the reasons I don't drink.
I don't want to feel guilty.

286
00:11:11,546 --> 00:11:13,090
I don't have to blame anyone.

287
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:24,101
Damn.

288
00:11:24,226 --> 00:11:25,268
That's awesome.

289
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:27,104
I miss riding a boat.

290
00:11:27,104 --> 00:11:31,024
Guys, I'm picturing
my hood guys over there.

291
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:33,193
Man, we would get wild.

292
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,445
I've never been to a boat party.

293
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,280
- Stop lying.
- I haven't.

294
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:40,075
- You have a boat in Niterói.
- Stop fooling around.

295
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:42,577
- Don't you have a boat?
- I'm going to be kidnapped.

296
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:43,745
Tell the truth.

297
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:46,081
Who has ever gone to a party on a boat?

298
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:47,124
I went a few times.

299
00:11:47,124 --> 00:11:49,126
- How long is your boat?
- Guys, no.

300
00:11:49,543 --> 00:11:51,044
It's in the end.

301
00:11:51,586 --> 00:11:52,796
The last...

302
00:11:53,463 --> 00:11:55,632
It's almost over. Ramon is sad. One day.

303
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:56,550
One day...

304
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,051
Guys, what an awesome party.

305
00:11:58,051 --> 00:11:59,636
If we'll miss this,

306
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:02,514
- let alone those guys...
- He's going to cry.

307
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:04,474
Carol, will you miss this?

308
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,600
- Obviously.
- Man...

309
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:07,811
Of course I'm going to miss you guys.

310
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:09,271
I'll miss you guys, too.

311
00:12:09,271 --> 00:12:10,856
You dreamed about my hair?

312
00:12:10,856 --> 00:12:12,315
I dreamed my cousin had hair like hers.

313
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,776
If we'll miss it, imagine those guys.

314
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:15,986
Imagine them...

315
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:17,779
It's a fucking awesome vibe.

316
00:12:17,779 --> 00:12:19,114
Wonderful. By the way...

317
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:21,741
Sleeping and waking up together, you know?

318
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,160
Waking up naked... I'm kidding.

319
00:12:23,285 --> 00:12:25,036
What will you miss the most?

320
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:27,247
What party will you miss the most, Pabllo?

321
00:12:27,247 --> 00:12:31,626
I think the first one, when they arrived,
they were all pumped up.

322
00:12:31,626 --> 00:12:33,336
There was trouble right away.

323
00:12:33,336 --> 00:12:34,921
At the Green Valley.

324
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,716
Yes, the first party, right?
I think it's the best.

325
00:12:37,841 --> 00:12:39,176
What about you, Mariano?

326
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:41,803
The first one, too.
That guy came in all pumped up.

327
00:12:41,803 --> 00:12:42,888
All gassed up.

328
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:44,848
The house was smelling fresh.

329
00:12:44,848 --> 00:12:46,183
Smelling like what?

330
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:47,559
Fresh.

331
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:50,937
I'm not excited for this party,
but for the last party later on.

332
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:52,689
There's going to be trouble.

333
00:13:00,071 --> 00:13:01,573
Where's your... Headset?

334
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:02,949
Headset?

335
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,409
I'm asking, please.

336
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:08,330
They should have some funk music there.

337
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:10,040
Yes, there could be some.

338
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:14,544
- Ramon is with another girl, look.
- Guys, Nathalia is a DJ groupie, you see?

339
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:15,587
No, groupie...

340
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,882
- Nathalia is with the DJ again.
- She's disturbed.

341
00:13:18,882 --> 00:13:22,219
I would love seeing her hook up
with everyone if she had dumped Ramon.

342
00:13:22,219 --> 00:13:24,638
I'm starting to miss this...

343
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:27,891
Guys, that DJ is not my type.

344
00:13:27,891 --> 00:13:30,644
- I would hook up with him.
- Girl, be my guest.

345
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:31,728
Again?

346
00:13:31,728 --> 00:13:32,729
Who is it?

347
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:35,649
- Who's with Ramon?
- Some girl.

348
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:38,944
Guys, João is the most iconic person
in the whole world.

349
00:13:38,944 --> 00:13:41,363
Some beautiful girl, I must say.

350
00:13:42,072 --> 00:13:43,615
Hook up with her!

351
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,908
She's right.

352
00:13:45,242 --> 00:13:48,703
Nathalia hooked up with the DJ,
and Ramon hooked up with the sailor?

353
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:50,539
Guys, if I'm kissing someone

354
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:52,791
and people come in shouting,
I'd say, "Are you nuts?"

355
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:56,419
Man, they're in a very good vibe,
right? Everybody.

356
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:58,672
Take her home, I'll pick her up there.

357
00:13:59,506 --> 00:14:00,423
I'm waiting.

358
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:03,468
He wants the boat back. He's right...

359
00:14:15,939 --> 00:14:17,440
There's a party at the house.

360
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,776
Fuck, a party at their house.

361
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:20,860
Oh, my God!

362
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,696
- Yeah, right.
- Everyone's there.

363
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,240
- Hey, isn't that...
- Everyone's there.

364
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,283
Yes, it's Mauro.

365
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:28,034
- It's Mauro.
- Everyone is there.

366
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,869
Mauro, Tomás, everyone.

367
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,204
Is Victoria there, too?

368
00:14:31,204 --> 00:14:33,081
- Victoria, Amanda.
- Everyone.

369
00:14:33,081 --> 00:14:34,666
Yeah, it's the season finale.

370
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,751
- Everyone they knew is there.
- A reunion.

371
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:37,877
That's cool.

372
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,379
It's really the last party.

373
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:41,423
Everyone who was part of it is there.

374
00:14:41,423 --> 00:14:45,468
Enjoy it. This is the party.
It's for you, guys.

375
00:14:47,345 --> 00:14:48,638
Let's go!

376
00:14:57,439 --> 00:14:59,399
Fuck! You're crazy!

377
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,650
Fuck, bro.

378
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,820
You're crazy, bro! Come on, fuck you!

379
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,701
We thought it was a fight,
but they were celebrating.

380
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:11,453
Pabllo, you said it.

381
00:15:11,453 --> 00:15:12,746
You're awesome, Pabllo.

382
00:15:12,746 --> 00:15:14,039
Pabllo said she'd roll on the grass.

383
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:15,332
Pabllo is not Pabllo for nothing.

384
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:18,627
- A happy friend rolls on the grass.
- Fuck, look.

385
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:22,088
- We thought it was trouble.
- I thought asses were being kicked.

386
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,007
Pabllo and Carol are the best.

387
00:15:24,007 --> 00:15:25,967
Look, it's Mauro...

388
00:15:26,593 --> 00:15:27,594
Oh, my God.

389
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,179
Mauro was very respectful.
He kissed her forehead.

390
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:30,555
He didn't want a kiss.

391
00:15:30,555 --> 00:15:32,015
- It's Vic!
- It's Vic!

392
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:33,266
It's Vic!

393
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:35,477
Vic is an icon. I want to go out with Vic.

394
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:37,145
Vic is going to get me a lot of boys.

395
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:38,855
Murilo is still wearing
his patterned shirts.

396
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:41,232
Since the first day,
he's just been wearing them.

397
00:15:41,232 --> 00:15:43,526
Such a loving atmosphere going on there.

398
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:44,778
How can there be a fight?

399
00:15:44,778 --> 00:15:45,904
I don't think...

400
00:15:45,904 --> 00:15:47,989
Because of booze.

401
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,199
There's a fight in the teaser.

402
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,742
No, that roll was a love roll.

403
00:15:50,742 --> 00:15:51,701
It was on the grass.

404
00:15:51,701 --> 00:15:52,661
There was a fight.

405
00:15:52,661 --> 00:15:53,953
Remember the girl...

406
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,288
That fight at the club...

407
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:56,373
Let me say something.

408
00:15:56,373 --> 00:15:58,333
Guys... They will fight.

409
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:01,044
Do you think there's not going
to be a fight in the last episode?

410
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:02,837
There's somebody you met in day one.

411
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:05,590
- I want to tell you she's here.
- I can't believe it!

412
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:08,051
Do you know who she is?
Joyce is over there!

413
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,511
- Who?
- Joyce, João.

414
00:16:09,511 --> 00:16:12,639
Joyce. João dressed the broom like her.

415
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:19,729
- You became a caricature.
- I'm not that crazy.

416
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:20,939
- And it's identical.
- Really?

417
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:23,566
Wow, what a beautiful girl...
I didn't know...

418
00:16:23,566 --> 00:16:25,110
I can't believe it!

419
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,027
That's so cute!

420
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:29,239
"What a beautiful girl. I didn't know."
He now realized she's pretty.

421
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:31,700
He's going to fall down with that chick.

422
00:16:32,242 --> 00:16:34,285
May I have one minute of your attention,

423
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:38,873
to the blue curtain,
to welcome tonight's great number...

424
00:16:38,873 --> 00:16:41,376
Pabllo Vittar and MC Carol!

425
00:16:42,544 --> 00:16:44,629
Then Carol shows up and says,
"I'm a bandit."

426
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:46,923
- Dennis!
- DJ Dennis!

427
00:16:46,923 --> 00:16:48,508
Icon!

428
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:51,302
- Damn, man, that's cool!
- Oh, no...

429
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:53,054
It's my heart

430
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:54,139
Now we're talking.

431
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:55,348
The theme song.

432
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:58,101
- I miss funk music, guys. Can I dance?
- What?

433
00:16:58,101 --> 00:16:59,018
What?

434
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:01,312
My friend, Cantini. Go.

435
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:04,649
This is what life is all about

436
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:07,026
Making love every day

437
00:17:07,152 --> 00:17:08,403
This song is by Dennis.

438
00:17:08,403 --> 00:17:12,365
Waking up naked with you by my side

439
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,283
I hope our love...

440
00:17:13,283 --> 00:17:14,242
I ship you two.

441
00:17:14,242 --> 00:17:15,744
Do the little square dance move.

442
00:17:15,744 --> 00:17:18,705
This is what life is all about

443
00:17:18,705 --> 00:17:22,250
Making love every day

444
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:26,254
Waking up naked with you by my side

445
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:28,798
I hope our love never turns into routine

446
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:30,675
- Guys...
- I love those two.

447
00:17:30,675 --> 00:17:32,093
Do you know when a show
is ending and you,

448
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:34,137
"I can't believe
my favorite show is ending?"

449
00:17:34,137 --> 00:17:36,055
Yes, that's it. I'm like this.

450
00:17:36,347 --> 00:17:39,058
- Damn, man.
- Man, this is so cool, huh?

451
00:17:43,646 --> 00:17:47,358
This is what life is all about

452
00:17:50,695 --> 00:17:53,323
This is what life is all about

453
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:57,243
Making love every day

454
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:00,747
Waking up naked with Carol by my side

455
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:02,499
And João...

456
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:04,417
It's not me.

457
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:05,919
I'm just paying homage.

458
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,003
Carol doesn't bang women.

459
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:08,588
Thanks, Dennis!

460
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,757
- Wonderful.
- Very good.

461
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,592
Look at this festival finale.

462
00:18:13,009 --> 00:18:15,178
Guys, look at the fireworks, look!

463
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:18,848
Fuck, Amazon.
Amazon nailed it on the fireworks.

464
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,183
She's happy with the fireworks.

465
00:18:20,183 --> 00:18:22,018
I love fireworks.

466
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,521
Look, what they're...

467
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:30,985
- Bia! You're perfect, Bia.
- First time.

468
00:18:30,985 --> 00:18:32,320
Bia is my spirit animal.

469
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:34,823
- Bia is confident.
- Bia is fucking awesome.

470
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:38,451
- Blondie!
- Look at Blondie, look.

471
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:39,786
Blondie! Blondie!

472
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:40,787
Blondie.

473
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:43,456
- After all, did she have sex?
- Go, Nathalia!

474
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:45,124
God bless that shirtless guy.

475
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,626
- Drops...
- I remember him.

476
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:49,045
I cried on my reality show
because of the food.

477
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:50,129
- Ramon!
- Ramonzera.

478
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:52,215
- Ramonzera is a nice guy, too.
- Ramon!

479
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:54,551
- Ramon. My crush.
- I love Ramon.

480
00:18:54,551 --> 00:18:55,802
Ramon is a nice guy.

481
00:18:56,928 --> 00:19:00,306
Tay... Beautiful Tay.

482
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:02,308
There are a lot of beautiful people.

483
00:19:02,308 --> 00:19:03,685
They're showing each one's moments.

484
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:07,355
His eyes welled up with tears.
Fuck. Oh, my God.

485
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,315
Now it's Murilo.

486
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:15,029
Murilo! Murilo!

487
00:19:15,029 --> 00:19:17,323
- I choose Murilo, no doubt.
- Murilo, too.

488
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,242
I'll miss João, let me tell you.

489
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:20,660
- Guys.
- João!

490
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,078
João!

491
00:19:22,078 --> 00:19:24,539
He has the most beautiful ass.

492
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,416
I want to be friends with João.

493
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,876
João, please, add me.

494
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,503
I don't know where but do it.

495
00:19:31,421 --> 00:19:32,672
Luan.

496
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:33,923
- I like Luan.
- Luan...

497
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:37,093
Luan screwed up,
but he was a nice guy after that.

498
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,595
He made mistakes, then made it right.

499
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:40,138
Who doesn't make mistakes?

500
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:41,347
Exactly. You said it all.

501
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:42,307
All right.

502
00:19:42,307 --> 00:19:43,308
Stop it.

503
00:19:43,308 --> 00:19:45,476
I think we deserve to toast, too.

504
00:19:45,476 --> 00:19:46,811
Let's do this!

505
00:19:46,811 --> 00:19:48,187
Let's have a toast. Wait.

506
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,355
Titto, come here.

507
00:19:49,772 --> 00:19:51,024
Oops. Let's do it.

508
00:19:51,024 --> 00:19:52,817
Help him, Titto. The house is yours.

509
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,403
Every day...

510
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:56,404
Come here, everybody.

511
00:19:56,404 --> 00:19:57,697
Waking up naked

512
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:58,990
Get the glasses. I open it.

513
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,158
I get the glasses.

514
00:20:00,158 --> 00:20:02,285
- Do we have to get up?
- Champagne.

515
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:05,246
Take it, here. Everyone gets a glass.

516
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:06,623
- Honeymoon.
- That's right.

517
00:20:06,623 --> 00:20:08,708
We'll pretend we're in Floripa.

518
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:09,792
- Young lady.
- Can I open it?

519
00:20:09,792 --> 00:20:11,669
- Wait. Are we going to toast?
- Look.

520
00:20:11,669 --> 00:20:14,005
One, two, three and...

521
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:16,799
- Floripa!
- Open it.

522
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:20,511
I feel like I'm on a show.

523
00:20:20,511 --> 00:20:23,514
Waking up naked

524
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,391
- Making love every day
- With Titto by my side

525
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:26,851
Come on, Carol!

526
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:27,769
You deceive me.

527
00:20:27,769 --> 00:20:28,686
Waking up at 11:00 a.m.

528
00:20:28,686 --> 00:20:29,771
Waking up naked with Carol by my side

529
00:20:29,771 --> 00:20:31,022
Where's yours, Titto?

530
00:20:31,022 --> 00:20:32,148
Mine is Red Bull, I don't drink.

531
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:33,316
No, just pretend it.

532
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:34,359
- Go.
- You are shameless.

533
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,276
Pretend.

534
00:20:35,276 --> 00:20:38,112
This is what life is all about

535
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:39,614
Making love every day

536
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:41,074
Cheers!

537
00:20:41,282 --> 00:20:42,283
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

538
00:20:42,283 --> 00:20:43,618
- I want it. Come.
- Toast!

539
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:44,661
Cheers!

540
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:48,581
Let's take the picture. Let's do the pose.

541
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,582
Let's do the pose.

542
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:50,625
- I'm like João.
- Blondie.

543
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:53,252
- I'm like Blondie.
- You really are.

544
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,963
- I'm like Tay.
- I'm like Bia.

545
00:20:54,963 --> 00:20:56,172
Yes.

546
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:00,802
- Let's start drinking.
- Such a whore.

547
00:21:00,802 --> 00:21:02,971
Fill my glass.
Titto doesn't know how to serve.

548
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,973
This could be better.

549
00:21:04,973 --> 00:21:07,350
But it's what we've got now...

550
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:10,186
Oh, my God, at the end?

551
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:13,064
- Everything was fine, he toasted...
- They just clicked.

552
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:14,565
He didn't do it in the end.

553
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:15,650
What a gorgeous brunette.

554
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,485
There's more where that came from.

555
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:20,029
Luan kissed that girl.
It's not Beatriz.

556
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:21,698
"Now I'm going to enjoy it."

557
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:24,200
- You thought it was over.
- Did you hear?

558
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,660
- No way he did it.
- Fuck.

559
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,704
Guys, this is madness.

560
00:21:28,246 --> 00:21:30,415
He realized Beatriz saw that, look.

561
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,209
Hey, no...

562
00:21:33,209 --> 00:21:35,837
Hey, no jealousy, my baby.
No jealousy, okay?

563
00:21:35,837 --> 00:21:37,922
Enough... Tonight I'm going to go wild.

564
00:21:38,381 --> 00:21:39,465
Jeez.

565
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:42,885
What did I tell you, guys?
There's going to be trouble.

566
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:44,053
They probably ran out of booze.

567
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,764
I can't believe
he made that mistake at the end.

568
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:49,017
- I see trouble.
- Is it him over there?

569
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:50,143
Is it him?

570
00:21:50,143 --> 00:21:51,644
- That's Luan.
- Murilo and Tay.

571
00:21:51,644 --> 00:21:53,187
- It's Luan.
- That's Luan.

572
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:54,313
- Murilo and Luan.
- On the floor?

573
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,815
- It's Luan.
- Is it Luan?

574
00:21:55,815 --> 00:21:57,275
- What about Tay?
- No!

575
00:21:57,275 --> 00:21:59,610
He kissed two people.

576
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:00,528
Fuck it.

577
00:22:00,528 --> 00:22:01,654
I'm going to beat him tonight.

578
00:22:01,654 --> 00:22:02,864
Me, too. This is mean.

579
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:04,532
God.

580
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:07,785
He said, "I don't want it anymore.
This is going to end..."

581
00:22:07,785 --> 00:22:08,995
Luan said he didn't want it anymore?

582
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:09,996
- No.
- Luan?

583
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:11,706
- He's there.
- Luan said that to her?

584
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:12,707
No, he didn't.

585
00:22:12,707 --> 00:22:13,708
He hooked up with one more.

586
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:14,876
He's acting crazy.

587
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:16,627
He went around kissing everybody...

588
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:18,004
- Yes.
- He said nothing.

589
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:20,423
But they didn't decide
what they were feeling.

590
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:23,593
He said he loved Bia. Beatriz.

591
00:22:23,593 --> 00:22:24,927
In the red room.

592
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:26,929
- Look!
- But he betrayed her.

593
00:22:26,929 --> 00:22:28,973
Ouch. She came at him. She's upset.

594
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:31,142
Easy, easy.

595
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:32,602
Easy, girl.

596
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:34,896
Easy, easy.

597
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:36,314
I want to talk to this chick.

598
00:22:36,314 --> 00:22:37,523
I want to talk to this girl now.

599
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:38,941
- Easy, easy.
- This girl.

600
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,401
Come with me, young lady.

601
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:43,446
Wait, wait, wait.

602
00:22:44,197 --> 00:22:46,574
If this chick goes inside,
I'm going to kill her!

603
00:22:46,574 --> 00:22:48,701
Don't go, don't get mad... She's there.

604
00:22:49,368 --> 00:22:50,495
Can I go in with them?

605
00:22:50,495 --> 00:22:52,663
Better not. There will be trouble.

606
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:54,791
I'm going to take both of them.

607
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:57,418
Murilo, they don't even know
what happened.

608
00:22:57,418 --> 00:22:59,712
Work things out with the girls.

609
00:22:59,837 --> 00:23:01,255
Fuck you!

610
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:05,176
- Once again, you're a clown!
- Easy... Stop it...

611
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:06,928
Piece of shit!

612
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:08,387
Easy, girl.

613
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,555
Nath...

614
00:23:09,889 --> 00:23:13,893
How can there be
such bad people in the world, man?

615
00:23:14,227 --> 00:23:16,062
- You're good.
- How?

616
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:20,066
- You're here to teach a lot of people.
- I can't take it.

617
00:23:20,066 --> 00:23:21,109
This is you.

618
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:24,987
I can't take it, man. God, help me.

619
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:26,823
What's that? Is that because of booze?

620
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:28,116
No, that's fucked up.

621
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:30,618
- It's Luan causing trouble.
- That's fucked up.

622
00:23:30,618 --> 00:23:32,120
There's booze...

623
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:33,287
One thing is seeing him dancing.

624
00:23:33,287 --> 00:23:34,497
...he hooked up with another girl,

625
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:35,915
when you see him doing it.

626
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:37,291
You know, he could've...

627
00:23:37,291 --> 00:23:39,293
He could've talked to her.

628
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:43,214
No. Baby, I'd impersonate Kimberly
and I'd end the whole party.

629
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:44,215
Yeah, man...

630
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:45,758
I'd get Dennis DJ's mic...

631
00:23:45,758 --> 00:23:48,344
He could be a little more smart...

632
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:51,430
Not smart. He's being smart.

633
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:52,974
He's not smart. He's a jerk.

634
00:23:52,974 --> 00:23:56,144
He could've been a person of character.

635
00:23:56,269 --> 00:23:57,520
- Yeah.
- Just a little bit.

636
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,983
He could've told her on the previous day,
"I don't want you anymore."

637
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:04,110
He wasn't a person of character
at any moment.

638
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:05,862
Because the whole time...

639
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:09,824
He was with Bia the whole time
and hooked up with other girls at parties.

640
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:12,034
He didn't tell her
and pretended they were a couple.

641
00:24:12,034 --> 00:24:13,536
Right in front of her.

642
00:24:13,536 --> 00:24:14,745
Here's the thing.

643
00:24:14,745 --> 00:24:15,830
I don't judge Nathalia.

644
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,833
He wanted somebody to have sex
with in the house,

645
00:24:18,833 --> 00:24:21,752
and, on the last day,
"I'm going to stop caring and fuck it."

646
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:24,463
He should've told her.

647
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:26,924
- I don't judge Nathalia.
- No, but also...

648
00:24:26,924 --> 00:24:28,926
I wouldn't say those girls were sluts.

649
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:30,052
- Never.
- Yeah.

650
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:31,304
That is something else.

651
00:24:31,304 --> 00:24:32,972
Nothing to do with that.

652
00:24:32,972 --> 00:24:35,141
If they step inside,
I'm kicking their asses.

653
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:36,100
Warn them.

654
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,644
What's the deal, Murilo?

655
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,062
They won't come in.

656
00:24:40,062 --> 00:24:41,856
No woman will step foot in the house.

657
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:43,858
If they come in,
I'll grab them by their hair.

658
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:45,818
- Shut up, Taynara!
- You sexist!

659
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:46,777
Shut up!

660
00:24:46,777 --> 00:24:48,196
You sexist!

661
00:24:49,447 --> 00:24:50,823
You're going to pay.

662
00:24:50,823 --> 00:24:53,868
Hey, bro. The two of them
have nothing to do with this.

663
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:56,871
Fuck it, they'll never get in here.

664
00:24:56,871 --> 00:25:00,875
If you bring them over, I'll beat them!

665
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:01,918
What a crazy woman.

666
00:25:01,918 --> 00:25:03,252
Chill. She's not crazy.

667
00:25:03,252 --> 00:25:05,129
- Respect her.
- Easy, easy.

668
00:25:05,129 --> 00:25:08,925
If you guys don't control yourselves,
I will. No more sexists, not anymore.

669
00:25:08,925 --> 00:25:11,636
The whole season,
I put up with him insulting women.

670
00:25:11,636 --> 00:25:12,595
- Not today!
- Tay.

671
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:14,263
- Not today!
- But listen...

672
00:25:14,263 --> 00:25:16,474
"You'd better not bring them over.

673
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:17,808
Things are ugly over there."

674
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:19,143
It's about the guy's character.

675
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:20,186
He doesn't have one!

676
00:25:20,186 --> 00:25:21,354
Everybody's noticed...

677
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:23,022
- Easy, man.
- It's okay.

678
00:25:23,022 --> 00:25:25,816
I'm going to pull their hair out
if they come in.

679
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:28,653
- Manu has nothing to do with it.
- Tell them to leave.

680
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:33,115
She knows the situation.
If she comes to my house...

681
00:25:33,115 --> 00:25:35,743
If she comes to my house,
I'm pulling her hair out.

682
00:25:35,743 --> 00:25:36,994
- Is Keila allowed?
- Sure.

683
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:38,329
- Keila is allowed.
- Okay.

684
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:43,834
So-and-so says, "Is Bianca allowed?

685
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:46,671
She's the only one
I want to have sex with..."

686
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:48,422
- Bro...
-"Is Bianca allowed?"

687
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:50,716
João is the best.

688
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:51,676
Again, he...

689
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:53,552
Again, he's helping her, look.

690
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,012
She blacked out because of booze.

691
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:56,222
Murilo is a gentleman.

692
00:25:56,222 --> 00:25:59,517
Murilo deserves a medal
for being so cute, God.

693
00:26:00,476 --> 00:26:03,729
- Who's helping him? Is it Tay?
- I think it's Taynara.

694
00:26:03,729 --> 00:26:06,065
Tay and Murilo are my dream couple.

695
00:26:06,065 --> 00:26:08,526
I wish we were a throuple. Maybe.

696
00:26:26,752 --> 00:26:27,670
Jeez...

697
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:31,424
Jeez, I was such a fool.
How did I make this kind of mistake?

698
00:26:31,424 --> 00:26:33,134
Don't do this to yourself.

699
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,762
He's two-faced, girl. He's two-faced.

700
00:26:37,513 --> 00:26:38,723
But how did I do this?

701
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:41,767
Girl, you didn't know. You took a while.
You took a while.

702
00:26:42,476 --> 00:26:43,477
Well...

703
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:46,105
It's normal.
Any person could experience this.

704
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:50,443
Part of him is a psychopath
and pretends to be someone he is not.

705
00:26:50,985 --> 00:26:52,153
He is crazy.

706
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:53,571
That's it.

707
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:55,781
Any person could be like you are now.

708
00:26:55,948 --> 00:26:57,992
We just found out who he is now,

709
00:26:57,992 --> 00:26:59,410
when there was alcohol involved.

710
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,203
Then we saw who he is.

711
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,961
The nobleness of character...

712
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,756
He had to be a man and say,
"I don't want you anymore.

713
00:27:11,756 --> 00:27:13,716
Today's the last day. I'm going wild.

714
00:27:13,716 --> 00:27:15,885
Don't be upset because we're not dating."

715
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,929
- He didn't...
- Let me finish.

716
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:20,639
The only thing missing was a real talk.

717
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:22,933
He didn't undervalue the woman.

718
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:25,102
He was just a jerk. That's all he's done.

719
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:28,689
Because both of them
did this the whole series.

720
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:33,027
She did, she brought someone over,
she did something...

721
00:27:33,027 --> 00:27:33,986
- Her?
- No, no.

722
00:27:33,986 --> 00:27:35,696
I didn't see her kissing anybody.

723
00:27:35,696 --> 00:27:36,947
- She just danced.
- No...

724
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:38,574
She was the quieter one.

725
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:40,534
I am talking about the house itself.

726
00:27:40,534 --> 00:27:43,120
The same way
the guys kicked those dudes...

727
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:46,207
She's right about calling him a sexist?

728
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:47,666
Okay, he's a sexist.

729
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:50,044
"And if those chicks come,
I'm pulling their hair out."

730
00:27:50,044 --> 00:27:52,505
If he's a sexist, then she's a feminist

731
00:27:52,505 --> 00:27:55,174
because you're defending
the women here, right?

732
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:57,676
One woman beats another one
who has nothing to do with it?

733
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:58,636
- No.
- That's wrong.

734
00:27:58,636 --> 00:28:01,013
You're contradicting yourself, man.

735
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:02,932
Fuck. Did you get it?

736
00:28:02,932 --> 00:28:05,810
- She was wrong in saying that.
- Right, Bia?

737
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:09,897
And those girls would be wrong
if they got in the house,

738
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:10,940
pretending nothing...

739
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,441
It's not because of that.

740
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,652
Her calling him sexist,

741
00:28:14,652 --> 00:28:17,071
if she's a feminist,
I don't know if she is,

742
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:20,032
but if she is, feminism asks
for gender equality.

743
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:24,578
Just like Luan got all the girls
at the party,

744
00:28:24,578 --> 00:28:26,914
as well as those girls
in front of her now,

745
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:29,208
she'll feel hurt
for not hooking up at all.

746
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:30,584
She's with Luan.

747
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:33,838
Luan broke down on her,
he said he loved her

748
00:28:33,838 --> 00:28:37,299
and they were fine again,
so that he messes up on the last day?

749
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:38,884
He's totally wrong.

750
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,886
I told you, he's got some nerve.

751
00:28:40,886 --> 00:28:41,971
He's got some nerve.

752
00:28:42,346 --> 00:28:46,517
No. Things got out of control,
and there were a lot of wrong people.

753
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:49,979
No one can start... defending. They can't.

754
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:51,188
No, that's for sure.

755
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:52,731
That's not possible, do you know why?

756
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:54,900
That's why I thought
it was very annoying...

757
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,360
You can't judge.

758
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,611
Don't say that.

759
00:28:57,611 --> 00:28:59,155
Why can't I say this?

760
00:28:59,155 --> 00:29:00,406
Because I'm not judging either.

761
00:29:00,406 --> 00:29:02,700
- That's my opinion.
- No, buddy.

762
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,243
I have the right to think...

763
00:29:04,243 --> 00:29:05,578
- No, buddy.
- I do.

764
00:29:05,578 --> 00:29:07,455
You said she was defending and whatnot...

765
00:29:07,455 --> 00:29:08,706
Wasn't she defending a cause?

766
00:29:08,706 --> 00:29:10,624
In the heat of the moment, she wasn't.

767
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:11,792
She talked about sexism.

768
00:29:11,792 --> 00:29:13,627
And then she acted like a sexist.

769
00:29:13,627 --> 00:29:15,546
She said she was going to hit those girls.

770
00:29:15,546 --> 00:29:17,173
You can't be a hypocrite.

771
00:29:17,173 --> 00:29:19,258
I'm going to say what I think, I'm sorry.

772
00:29:19,258 --> 00:29:20,801
Felipe, take it easy, look at me.

773
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:22,595
Felipe, do you think
I'm being a hypocrite?

774
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:24,722
Telling me I can't speak
is such hypocrisy.

775
00:29:24,722 --> 00:29:25,639
No.

776
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:26,640
- That's my opinion.
- No...

777
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,142
Do you think I'm being a hypocrite?

778
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:29,935
At any moment? Here?

779
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,312
Your opinion is perfect.

780
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:32,521
That's what I said.

781
00:29:32,521 --> 00:29:34,315
We won't defend causes 'cause...

782
00:29:34,315 --> 00:29:36,984
...it's not about sexism or feminism...
He's just got some nerve.

783
00:29:36,984 --> 00:29:37,943
That's it.

784
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,362
When you say,
"I don't know..." You're judging, too.

785
00:29:40,362 --> 00:29:41,280
Who am I judging?

786
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,615
"She does it and whatnot..."

787
00:29:42,615 --> 00:29:43,574
You can't judge.

788
00:29:43,574 --> 00:29:45,951
I'm just saying she can't
defend causes like that.

789
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,245
- No one is doing that.
- Where's everyone...

790
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:49,205
She is, fuck.

791
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:50,539
Didn't you see her defending a cause?

792
00:29:50,539 --> 00:29:51,916
If you're against...

793
00:29:51,916 --> 00:29:53,375
I'm not against a cause.

794
00:29:53,375 --> 00:29:54,543
you're defending a cause.

795
00:29:54,543 --> 00:29:57,046
Pabllo, the drink. Is it over?

796
00:29:57,046 --> 00:29:58,380
We must be impartial.

797
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:15,940
The house is destroyed.

798
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:17,608
It looks like a hurricane did that.

799
00:30:17,608 --> 00:30:19,985
It looks like my house.

800
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,197
Looks like it's been like that
for two days.

801
00:30:23,197 --> 00:30:24,156
- High five!
- Jesus.

802
00:30:24,156 --> 00:30:25,366
Fuck.

803
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:27,451
Looks like my house on a normal day.

804
00:30:27,451 --> 00:30:28,494
An abandoned banjo...

805
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:29,995
Looks like my bedroom...

806
00:30:29,995 --> 00:30:31,205
It's like that.

807
00:30:31,205 --> 00:30:33,040
Jeez, man.

808
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:33,958
Guys...

809
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:35,042
My pool, for now

810
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:36,752
- My bedroom.
- Look at that, bro.

811
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:38,254
It's a total mess, man.

812
00:30:38,254 --> 00:30:40,130
It's like that.
That's the reality.

813
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:41,298
- Fuck...
- Cell phone.

814
00:30:41,298 --> 00:30:42,299
What a mess, man.

815
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,426
Blondie is alone, as usual, poor girl.

816
00:30:44,426 --> 00:30:46,136
Jeez, poor girl, man.

817
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:48,222
She's sleeping.

818
00:30:48,222 --> 00:30:51,892
I wouldn't want to pack,
waking up with such a hangover.

819
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:53,352
Jeez, give me two days.

820
00:30:54,603 --> 00:30:56,105
Who's calling?

821
00:30:56,105 --> 00:30:58,023
Girl, they have to go, baby.

822
00:30:58,023 --> 00:30:59,024
You feel me?

823
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:05,781
Hey, guys.

824
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,117
I'm going to need help this summer.

825
00:31:08,659 --> 00:31:09,660
Who wants to come back?

826
00:31:11,996 --> 00:31:12,997
What?

827
00:31:15,791 --> 00:31:17,626
Did you see João's face?

828
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:18,877
He didn't even know...

829
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,963
Then he woke up. He didn't even know...

830
00:31:20,963 --> 00:31:23,549
"Who wants to come back?"
There's going to be a recap.

831
00:31:23,549 --> 00:31:25,843
They're going to stay at that house again.

832
00:31:25,843 --> 00:31:27,720
No, I hope some people don't go.

833
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:29,346
There were some people there who...

834
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:30,764
I think this was genius.

835
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:31,890
"Who wants to come back?"

836
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,891
Invite me...

837
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:36,812
In case there's Season 2, Amazon,
take us to a party one day? Just one day.

838
00:31:38,856 --> 00:31:40,024
Thanks, guys.

839
00:31:40,024 --> 00:31:41,525
Bye, I'm going to take food...

840
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:43,193
I'm going to pretend I'm an alcoholic.

841
00:31:43,193 --> 00:31:45,029
I want a chocolate milk combo!

842
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:46,196
I want to check...

843
00:31:46,196 --> 00:31:47,823
Help me out, Carol.
