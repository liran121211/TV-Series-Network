WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS
THE REVIEW

2
00:00:19,437 --> 00:00:21,605
Remember the fight
between Bia and Nathalia,

3
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,274
- who argued because of Luan.
- Yes.

4
00:00:23,274 --> 00:00:24,775
- Exactly.
- It's unbelievable.

5
00:00:24,775 --> 00:00:26,277
Unbelievable, brother.

6
00:00:26,277 --> 00:00:28,154
Let's watch this?

7
00:00:28,154 --> 00:00:29,989
Go, pass me the remote.

8
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:31,365
Press play with your heels.

9
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:35,953
It's me, fuck! This is my moment!
My moment's come.

10
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:48,174
Good morning, guys.

11
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,009
Look, the DJ slept there.

12
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:52,636
Did you have a good time yesterday?

13
00:00:52,636 --> 00:00:54,430
You... Jeez, awesome, man.

14
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:57,057
The DJ is with another girl, huh?

15
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:59,643
- They said you betrayed me? How so?
- Who did?

16
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:02,813
Blondie is very evolved, she's so zen.

17
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:05,274
Would you hook up with him after that?

18
00:01:05,274 --> 00:01:06,859
Obviously, I'm not dead.

19
00:01:06,859 --> 00:01:10,321
She got him there so they'd be together,
but she got shit-faced.

20
00:01:10,321 --> 00:01:11,280
Not his fault.

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,616
But would you hook up with him
after everything?

22
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:15,409
I wouldn't hook up with him ever.

23
00:01:15,409 --> 00:01:17,953
- I'm just assuming, Blondie.
- I'm not Blondie.

24
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:20,623
Bia, let's drive Vic
to the airport with me?

25
00:01:20,623 --> 00:01:23,584
- She's leaving already...
- I'm leaving...

26
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:26,629
Vic is so cute. I'm in love.

27
00:01:27,213 --> 00:01:28,756
- And the girls like her.
- Yeah.

28
00:01:28,756 --> 00:01:30,257
I think I'd be like her...

29
00:01:30,257 --> 00:01:33,969
Nathalia picked a fight
with her, remember?

30
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:35,805
She said she wanted to hook up with...

31
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:38,015
- Yeah... Luan.
- Hook up with Luan.

32
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:39,225
She's leaving, no way.

33
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:56,283
What about you, girl? You and Nath.

34
00:01:57,034 --> 00:02:01,539
- Are you okay?
- Man... She ran up there, girl.

35
00:02:01,539 --> 00:02:04,583
She ran up there and said,
"Bia! Bia! Bia, go downstairs!

36
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:07,294
Go downstairs! It's Luan, Luan!"

37
00:02:07,419 --> 00:02:10,840
Bro, I went there like a fool...
I made a scene, you know?

38
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,299
I went downstairs...

39
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:13,634
- Pissed.
- Obviously.

40
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:16,345
Do you realize there's
always a DTR in the car?

41
00:02:16,345 --> 00:02:18,722
- In the car.
- And the fight on the bus.

42
00:02:18,722 --> 00:02:20,933
Men fight in the bus and women in the car.

43
00:02:21,058 --> 00:02:22,643
Are you guys explosive?

44
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,854
That depends, depends on the moment.

45
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:27,314
Man, me, too. That depends.

46
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:29,567
Sometimes I'm very chill,
but a hothead, too.

47
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:30,985
I try to understand what's going on.

48
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:33,445
But I think that,
as much as Bia is explosive,

49
00:02:33,445 --> 00:02:35,531
she's already shown it sometimes,

50
00:02:35,531 --> 00:02:36,991
I think she couldn't take it anymore...

51
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:39,743
She put up with a lot of things
from Nathalia.

52
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,830
- Yeah, that was kind of the last straw.
- I think so, too.

53
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:50,963
What?

54
00:02:51,839 --> 00:02:55,759
Here's what I think... There'll be moments
when I'll have to like myself,

55
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:58,220
so I won't accept...

56
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:01,390
After everything she said to him.
How does she say that?

57
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,100
She's messing around, man.

58
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:07,563
...to be with me, don't sit on the fence
and show me another thing.

59
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:09,106
Is she breaking up with him?

60
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,400
...confusing yourself,
that's your problem...

61
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,318
I don't know.

62
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:14,236
I end up involving you
in another thing.

63
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:16,822
Got it? That has nothing to do with it.

64
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:21,035
That has nothing to do with your problems,
with your frustration.

65
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:22,578
Nobody has anything to do with it.

66
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:26,957
I think it's super honest
we have this conversation...

67
00:03:27,082 --> 00:03:28,083
and talk about it...

68
00:03:28,083 --> 00:03:29,293
Are they together?

69
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:31,462
Did they sleep together? What's going on?

70
00:03:31,462 --> 00:03:34,256
Yes, we saw at the beginning.
I don't know anymore.

71
00:03:34,381 --> 00:03:35,674
But did they have sex?

72
00:03:35,674 --> 00:03:36,884
I don't think so...

73
00:03:36,884 --> 00:03:37,927
But we haven't seen it, right?

74
00:03:37,927 --> 00:03:39,303
But they slept together.

75
00:03:39,303 --> 00:03:44,516
Got it? I faced mine and accepted them
since the beginning.

76
00:03:44,516 --> 00:03:46,852
I've been fucking doing it the whole time.

77
00:03:46,977 --> 00:03:49,229
Yes, I know you did.

78
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,983
Now, unfortunately,
we're done and I'm moving on.

79
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:55,361
- No, it's not unfortunately.
- Bye.

80
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:57,655
I'm already tired of Ramon.

81
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,533
So, they broke up, right?
They made it clear they're single.

82
00:04:01,659 --> 00:04:03,535
But Ramon wants to break up.

83
00:04:03,535 --> 00:04:06,288
That's funny because
he's not into her anymore.

84
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:10,084
She was the one who said.
She said, "Come off the fence."

85
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:24,056
João hits on everyone, look.

86
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,892
He's there for everyone.

87
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:29,019
I love Murilo's outfits, really.

88
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:31,313
Those patterned shirts.

89
00:04:36,068 --> 00:04:39,405
Ramon always does
those dance moves, right, man?

90
00:04:39,405 --> 00:04:42,074
He had to represent Niterói, guys.

91
00:04:42,074 --> 00:04:44,201
What's that? He's all stiff

92
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:47,788
But I think he has a cute way, you know?

93
00:04:51,834 --> 00:04:54,753
- You've already noticed, right?
- What?

94
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:56,505
You've already noticed...

95
00:04:56,505 --> 00:04:59,675
- This again, guys?
- But they were free, right?

96
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:01,635
I wonder if that will get messy.

97
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:02,636
Fuck it...

98
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:05,514
- I'm not with her.
- But...

99
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:08,142
Dear Lord.

100
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:10,477
- It was because...
- Man, I get sad.

101
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:13,981
You won't be sad because
I won't hook up with her.

102
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:15,107
- Come on.
- That's it.

103
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:19,194
- Chill out.
- You know, whatever you need... You know?

104
00:05:19,194 --> 00:05:23,157
Man, that's cool.
I like it. I think that's cool.

105
00:05:23,157 --> 00:05:26,910
I didn't find it cool. He's asking Ramon
if he can hook up with Nath...

106
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,414
They broke up, but he knows
there's something still going on.

107
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:32,875
I thought his approach
was a little different.

108
00:05:32,875 --> 00:05:35,169
- No.
- But it was ethical of him.

109
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,129
- Let me tell you.
- But Nathalia...

110
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:40,049
But if he hooks up with her,
it's messed up.

111
00:05:40,049 --> 00:05:41,467
Let me say something.

112
00:05:41,467 --> 00:05:44,386
There was that conversation
between Nathalia and Ramon.

113
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:45,721
Nathalia didn't want him.

114
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:48,432
Probably, everyone in the house knows,

115
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,768
but they like each other.
It was nice to say,

116
00:05:50,768 --> 00:05:55,856
"Man, your girl is flirting with me,
now what?" He was cool with it.

117
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,859
But he told her.
It was cool, but he said to him,

118
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,820
-"We're not together anymore, go on."
- No.

119
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,283
And he said, "Are you going to be sad?"
Then he said, "I don't know."

120
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:08,202
"Then I won't do it."

121
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:09,703
He asked for permission.

122
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:12,372
The guy didn't give it
because he still likes her.

123
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,957
Here's what I think.

124
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:16,460
She flirted with him
because she's single and so is he.

125
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:20,672
But he knows the other guy likes her,
so he tried to handle the situation...

126
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:23,801
- He was ethical.
- ...with everyone drinking...

127
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:25,385
Girl, here's what I think.

128
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:28,555
He had to ask Nathalia,
since he's the one who wants her.

129
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,933
He didn't have to ask Ramon, like,

130
00:06:30,933 --> 00:06:33,644
"Can I hook up with the girl
you're hooking up with?"

131
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:36,438
That's a question of ethics between men...

132
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:38,398
That's because men stick together.

133
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:39,316
Men stick together.

134
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:43,445
Yes, guys. The girl is there like a coin,
in the middle...

135
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:48,033
- No.
- She'll be like a coin if she wants some.

136
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,494
She's been doing this at times.

137
00:06:50,494 --> 00:06:53,747
She already wants to stay.
But he said, "I want to hook up with her,

138
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,958
but my friend is over there."

139
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:58,794
Tomás was explaining himself to Ramon.

140
00:06:58,794 --> 00:07:01,755
Why didn't he say to Nathalia,
"I want to be with you.

141
00:07:01,755 --> 00:07:05,217
Are you with Ramon?
How are you two doing?"

142
00:07:05,217 --> 00:07:06,927
Why did he only talk to the guy?

143
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:08,053
It's not like that.

144
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:09,304
- Men don't argue.
- No.

145
00:07:09,304 --> 00:07:11,598
It's a guy thing. Men want to fight.

146
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,768
So, men stick together
so they don't fight.

147
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:18,397
Nobody cares about anyone.

148
00:07:18,397 --> 00:07:19,523
Of course they care.

149
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:22,901
Nobody gives up fucking somebody
because of another girl...

150
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,487
- Stop it!
- We don't express our feelings.

151
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:28,949
I give up. No, Carol, I disagree.

152
00:07:28,949 --> 00:07:31,577
A friend of mine met a guy
and he liked him a lot.

153
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:35,706
Then he says he's deeply in love.
Then I signed up on a dating app.

154
00:07:35,706 --> 00:07:38,417
I found the guy there,
but I didn't recognize him.

155
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:41,086
We started to talk,
and I remembered he was that boy

156
00:07:41,086 --> 00:07:44,131
and I scolded him,
"Man, you did this to my friend.

157
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:47,843
My friend likes you
and you're on this app."

158
00:07:47,843 --> 00:07:51,471
Even if I wanted to hook up
with him later,

159
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,849
I didn't do it.
I knew he was with my friend.

160
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:55,100
I'm loyal to myself.

161
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:58,645
- Do you have a lighter?
- Do you a have a smoke?

162
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,647
- He's hot.
- Wait, listen.

163
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,400
When I first got here,

164
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:07,905
I wanted to hook up with you
pretty bad. But first...

165
00:08:09,573 --> 00:08:11,825
Look, she's like you, a seducer.

166
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:14,369
She made a face...

167
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:17,080
She tried to avoid him, but she'd do it.

168
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,208
...if he was gonna be mad, you know?

169
00:08:20,209 --> 00:08:25,255
Then he started stalling, like,
"No worries,

170
00:08:25,255 --> 00:08:27,466
"we have nothing going on."

171
00:08:27,466 --> 00:08:30,552
That's cute, he cares.

172
00:08:30,552 --> 00:08:33,305
She's upset because she wanted
to hook up with Tomás.

173
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:37,684
I said, "Man, really, tell me the truth.

174
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:40,687
Would you mind?" He said, "I would."

175
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:45,108
I asked, "Then, you want to be her?"

176
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:49,279
He said, "I don't know."
It's kind of... you know?

177
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,740
We argued. I broke up with him. That's it.

178
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,743
I'll never be chosen again by anybody.
From now on,

179
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:56,620
I'm the one who's going to choose.

180
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:58,163
I'm not bad-looking...

181
00:08:58,163 --> 00:09:01,708
- I'm not sure about annoying.
- You're just crazy.

182
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,628
Guys, put yourselves in her shoes.

183
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:06,505
I want to fuck Tomás.

184
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:08,966
He was amazing, huh? He did it right.

185
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,259
He'll hook up with her.

186
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:11,260
Look.

187
00:09:11,802 --> 00:09:13,178
That's what I wanted.

188
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:15,347
He went to talk to her, got it?

189
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,182
But they're going to kiss.

190
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:20,602
Kiss him. It's okay.
If you're the good one.

191
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:23,522
Jeez.

192
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:28,277
Everything happens at the right time

193
00:09:28,277 --> 00:09:31,113
- Let's toast here.
- There's a right time for everything.

194
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:34,658
I have a friend who says this, you know?

195
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:36,076
To my way of thinking,

196
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:38,829
he was not trying to kiss her.
He hugged her

197
00:09:38,829 --> 00:09:41,081
- and did this.
- He tried to kiss her.

198
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,958
It doesn't make sense.

199
00:09:44,042 --> 00:09:46,837
- Then he comes with a flower.
- He is, man.

200
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:51,967
A guy tells another guy,
"Is it bad if I hook up with this girl?"

201
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:54,845
And he says, "I don't know,
I think I would be bummed."

202
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:56,430
It was his play.

203
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,806
That's what I'm saying.

204
00:09:57,806 --> 00:10:03,854
It was a game. He thought
he was going to have an answer.

205
00:10:04,563 --> 00:10:07,691
He thought he was going to have
an answer from Ramon, you know?

206
00:10:07,691 --> 00:10:11,153
Men have their ego.
They won't say that they care.

207
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:13,947
But Ramon is being totally honest,
you know? He said...

208
00:10:13,947 --> 00:10:16,700
- Can I speak now?
- Speak, girl. Speak, Bia.

209
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:21,330
What's going on? Man, there's no other
explanation for what happened.

210
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,624
He asked a question and had an answer.

211
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,044
- He had to stay out of it, but he didn't.
- Yep.

212
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:30,881
Nathalia did what she's used to doing
again. She must've looked at Ramon,

213
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,883
I don't know what happened there.

214
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:35,761
Regardless if it's right or wrong,
he hit on her.

215
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:38,680
What did she do? Once again,

216
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:42,642
she played, left, looked to the side,
laughed, mocked.

217
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:46,188
Do you think she always does it
to play with Ramon?

218
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:48,774
Girl, no, I think
she's not playing with Ramon,

219
00:10:48,774 --> 00:10:50,692
but with that situation, you know?

220
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:55,072
- She wants to show off.
- Yeah, I don't know.

221
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:58,158
She was saying, "I'm hot, I'm beautiful,

222
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,327
- I'm this, I'm that."
- The best scenario...

223
00:11:00,327 --> 00:11:01,244
There's a tube...

224
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:03,955
Buddy, the best scenario would be

225
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:07,667
if she hooked up with him.

226
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,295
Both of them wanted the same thing.

227
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,381
But, no, she played with him and flirted.

228
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:14,091
The dude hit on her,
she ran away.

229
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:15,342
Do you know what to call Nathalia?

230
00:11:15,342 --> 00:11:17,010
She's a player.

231
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:21,556
She plays with everybody
and causes trouble in the entire house.

232
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:23,475
She likes
to provoke disagreements.

233
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:26,019
She says something about...

234
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,313
She likes a mess.

235
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:29,398
I'm tired of this.

236
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:32,692
- Man, I can't stand this yo-yo.
- What?

237
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,610
#YOYO

238
00:11:33,610 --> 00:11:35,195
Yo-yo. That comes and goes.

239
00:11:35,779 --> 00:11:38,490
- I can't see anything.
- This one got blurred.

240
00:11:45,205 --> 00:11:48,500
Jeez, these pictures were crazy.

241
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:55,382
Say what you have to say.

242
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:57,134
Let's live one day at a time.

243
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:00,637
This bullshit again?

244
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,848
- What?
- You keep saying the same thing.

245
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:06,309
But you were the one who said this.

246
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,565
Let's make this work.

247
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:14,151
- Me?
- Let's go. You're in, right?

248
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:18,738
This includes you.

249
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,331
- I've had enough.
- Who thought they would never come back?

250
00:12:28,331 --> 00:12:29,374
- Me.
- I never did.

251
00:12:29,374 --> 00:12:30,625
I said they'd get back together.

252
00:12:30,625 --> 00:12:32,502
I don't believe in anything of that.

253
00:12:32,502 --> 00:12:35,213
I only believe in looseness...

254
00:12:35,213 --> 00:12:39,551
No, girl, their kissing is different.
They like each other.

255
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:41,887
She likes him.
Even if she acts weird.

256
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:43,054
But I think...

257
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:45,807
She's doing all that
because she likes him.

258
00:12:45,807 --> 00:12:47,767
Pay attention, Carol.

259
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,811
She might not love, but she likes him.

260
00:12:49,811 --> 00:12:51,688
Otherwise, she'd hook up with others.

261
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:52,731
He doesn't like her.

262
00:12:52,731 --> 00:12:54,441
More guys than she's hooked up with?

263
00:12:54,441 --> 00:12:56,109
Others? She didn't.

264
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,278
Not so much. She fights more.

265
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:01,823
She summoned that guy.
She brought that guy from Goiânia...

266
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,949
And that's it.

267
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,534
She didn't spend the night.

268
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,411
But she went there
and had sex...

269
00:13:06,411 --> 00:13:07,496
She had sex and got up.

270
00:13:07,496 --> 00:13:08,663
Then I don't know.

271
00:13:08,663 --> 00:13:11,500
She got up.
She didn't cuddle with him, right?

272
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,836
I think she brought that guy
to make him jealous.

273
00:13:14,836 --> 00:13:16,671
Carol, the best of all of us
at games.

274
00:13:17,088 --> 00:13:20,842
I think she invited that guy
because she likes him.

275
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:24,262
That's why she didn't stay with him
until the end. She likes him.

276
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:27,015
She flirted with...

277
00:13:27,015 --> 00:13:28,600
- Tomás.
- Tomás because of him.

278
00:13:28,725 --> 00:13:30,685
She didn't hook up with Tomás
because of him.

279
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:33,688
She loves badly, but she likes him.

280
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:36,525
Will this relationship evolve?

281
00:13:38,026 --> 00:13:41,404
- Hey, Ti, pay attention. Otherwise...
- She'll be in this forever.

282
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:44,032
I feel like slapping his face,

283
00:13:44,032 --> 00:13:45,158
"Wake up, you idiot."

284
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,035
You're here to try to understand these...

285
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,828
I'm neither of those two, thank God.

286
00:13:49,496 --> 00:13:50,622
Titto is the boss.

287
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:51,706
He's João and Blondie.

288
00:13:51,706 --> 00:13:53,208
- Man, I think...
- I'm not...

289
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:57,712
I think that when we love,
we have different strategies.

290
00:13:57,712 --> 00:14:00,090
But she's not good at strategy, you know?

291
00:14:00,382 --> 00:14:02,300
No, but that's too heavy.

292
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:06,429
It's not about strategy.
it's about knowing...

293
00:14:06,429 --> 00:14:10,517
Like, if you love,
you need to know your limit.

294
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:12,936
Your life is a war, right?

295
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:16,856
Her life is a war. She's always coming up
with a plan to destroy the enemy.

296
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:20,944
The human being that
she has a relationship with is her enemy.

297
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:29,286
I'd bounce, too.
I wouldn't speak to anyone.

298
00:14:29,286 --> 00:14:32,289
- Not even to your brother?
- I'd speak to my brother.

299
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:34,791
It was my brother who called me, right?

300
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:35,875
"Are you in Floripa?"

301
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,211
"Yes, but I'm leaving."
Didn't you like it?

302
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,714
- No.
-"Yes, but I'm..."

303
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:43,049
Sorry, is this the bench
from A Praça É Nossa?

304
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,926
Fuck, I got the pun now.

305
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,678
- I'm sorry.
- Give it up for him.

306
00:14:46,678 --> 00:14:48,263
Jeez, "lol."

307
00:14:48,263 --> 00:14:50,348
Shut up, you have to laugh at my jokes.

308
00:14:50,348 --> 00:14:54,894
If you met one of the members of this show
on the street, what would you do?

309
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:57,063
I'd say this, "Jeez, I watched the show. "

310
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,898
I think I would say to Murilo,

311
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,651
"Murilo and Taynara,
you're both my crushes." Really.

312
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:04,321
I'd say this, "Let's be a throuple?"

313
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:07,490
This beach is a nude beach... Naturalism.

314
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:11,202
Couples that want to
get naked... Don't do it...

315
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:13,121
Look at João.

316
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:18,418
- No way!
- Damn. Take it off, Luan. Take it off!

317
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,128
No way, guys.

318
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:22,255
They're squeezing their junk...

319
00:15:22,255 --> 00:15:25,550
- He wants to guarantee his place.
- You're an observant person.

320
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,135
Girl...

321
00:15:27,135 --> 00:15:28,762
Go, Carrara!

322
00:15:29,763 --> 00:15:33,308
Jeez, bro. I can't believe it, man.

323
00:15:34,517 --> 00:15:36,645
Those guys got naked there.

324
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:42,442
- What an ass.
- I can't see it.

325
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:45,278
- Rewind it, I want to see it.
- Shut up! No fucking way!

326
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:47,405
I didn't see it very well when Luan...

327
00:15:47,405 --> 00:15:50,325
I think Luan is
the most well-hung of that house.

328
00:15:50,325 --> 00:15:53,203
Who do you think is
the most well-hung of that house?

329
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:55,664
- I'm sorry.
- MC Carol from Niterói, go.

330
00:15:56,289 --> 00:16:00,085
- I think it's the Indian.
- I think it's Luan.

331
00:16:00,085 --> 00:16:01,920
Guys, I'm so shocked by that dick.

332
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,881
- I loved this.
- Did you see Luan's cock? I'm shocked!

333
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:07,175
- I think it was offensive.
- That's not fun.

334
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:08,760
- Baby, I loved it.
- I loved it.

335
00:16:09,344 --> 00:16:11,471
- Stop it, Carol!
- That's not fun.

336
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,476
- Go. Cell phone?
- Yeah.

337
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,937
Hi, everybody, how are you?

338
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:21,523
Once again I'll need you guys at the bar.

339
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,985
Tonight I'm counting on girls here. Okay?

340
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:27,487
See you then.

341
00:16:28,071 --> 00:16:30,115
- This is going...
- Good one, Ricardão!

342
00:16:30,115 --> 00:16:33,284
Murilo, "There's a funk party tonight!"
Like, he's getting even.

343
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,745
You see, Carol? It's your day.

344
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:38,456
Guys, I'm shocked by... With Luan.

345
00:16:38,456 --> 00:16:40,834
They let the boys out, fuck!

346
00:16:44,212 --> 00:16:47,841
- Guys, Murilo is ironing his clothes.
- Dear Lord.

347
00:16:47,841 --> 00:16:48,842
WE WENT TO THE RAP PARTY
LOVE YOU

348
00:16:48,842 --> 00:16:50,468
They're leaving a note for the girls.

349
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:52,470
But they're going to get screwed.

350
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,681
They're doing the same.

351
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:58,059
"We went to the rap party."
They've already gone to that club.

352
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:01,813
It was that one where everyone
kissed everyone and it was a big mess.

353
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,983
-"We went to the rap party."
- Caps Lock.

354
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,943
When Caps Lock is on.

355
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:10,363
Aren't you from São Paulo?
How do you not know "Caps Lock"?

356
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:11,698
- Never heard of it.
- Caps Lock.

357
00:17:11,698 --> 00:17:14,659
Caps Lock? Stop it, you're old!

358
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:16,911
- Caps lock.
- Caps lock. That huge font.

359
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,247
No, Caps Lock is the name of a party.

360
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,416
"Hi, how are you?" Caps lock.

361
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,671
This is the real "one for all," right?

362
00:17:26,671 --> 00:17:28,173
This is the "one for all."

363
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:31,259
They're erasing their memories
because they're going to fuck things up.

364
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:32,427
One for all...

365
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:34,387
One for all and all for one!

366
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,639
Jeez, they're going to fuck things up.

367
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,308
They know they're being filmed...

368
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:39,893
Keeping a low profile, got it?

369
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:43,813
- But they don't see it.
- Yeah.

370
00:17:48,693 --> 00:17:51,613
"What are you doing here?"
I came to buy some bread.

371
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:54,032
- What the hell, man?
- João...

372
00:17:54,032 --> 00:17:55,241
João, right?

373
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:57,786
- Luan? Luan!
- Luan...

374
00:17:57,786 --> 00:17:59,078
Where's Murilo?

375
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:04,292
Man, did those guys go to the club
and really go crazy.

376
00:18:04,292 --> 00:18:06,878
- I'm shocked!
- Where's Luan?

377
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:08,797
I hope Murilo doesn't kiss anyone,

378
00:18:08,797 --> 00:18:11,090
- for Christ's sake.
- João again?

379
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,551
But João is single. Everyone is, but...

380
00:18:13,551 --> 00:18:17,180
What happens here, stays here...
We trust each other, so...

381
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,643
Forget this. Tomorrow we sort this out
if anybody wants to say...

382
00:18:21,643 --> 00:18:24,479
- Nobody is saying anything.
- That's it. The same story.

383
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:29,275
Have you done that? Mess things up
and make an arrangement with your friends?

384
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,610
- You're crazy.
- What happens...

385
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:31,903
...in Vegas, stays in Vegas.

386
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:33,947
If you're saying this,
you've done it.

387
00:18:33,947 --> 00:18:36,115
No, I've done it.

388
00:18:36,115 --> 00:18:38,660
- Men suck.
- I didn't understand what they said.

389
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,453
"Nobody is saying anything."

390
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:41,371
Men suck.

391
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:43,289
- Men suck.
- That's fucked up, baby.

392
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:44,332
Men suck.

393
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:46,125
There's always a son of a bitch.

394
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,335
That will tell...

395
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,712
I'm going to pick them.
Do you give me a shot?

396
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:53,007
Look at his face, he's a "bifooloft."

397
00:18:53,007 --> 00:18:55,218
- My God.
- He's big, a fool and soft.

398
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:56,719
A lot of "bifooloft."

399
00:18:56,719 --> 00:18:59,556
He looks like a Volkswagen
Beetle with the door open.

400
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:02,934
Looks like those guys came
out of a factory. They all look alike.

401
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:05,687
- Yeah, they're all clones.
- They're all similar.

402
00:19:06,771 --> 00:19:08,898
The four of them drank it.

403
00:19:08,898 --> 00:19:12,068
I want to invite you to our house,
for a warmup.

404
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:13,361
Are you in? The four of you?

405
00:19:13,361 --> 00:19:15,864
The boys are thinking
they're going to fuck everyone.

406
00:19:15,864 --> 00:19:19,117
Would you rather an afterparty,
or taking him home?

407
00:19:19,117 --> 00:19:21,703
I don't take boys home.
I don't couple up at parties.

408
00:19:21,828 --> 00:19:24,372
I'd rather be alone
because I'll be enjoying

409
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,499
- rather than coupling up.
- I think so, too.

410
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:29,168
- What about you, Carol?
- I'd rather take one home.

411
00:19:35,425 --> 00:19:37,844
He looks like he has a six pack.
Excuse me.

412
00:19:37,844 --> 00:19:39,429
Does he, man? Let's see...

413
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:46,603
- Just a little. Just a little.
- Can I see it again?

414
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:50,565
Applause.

415
00:19:50,565 --> 00:19:51,774
You don't deserve it.

416
00:19:51,774 --> 00:19:53,443
You deserve the limbs together.

417
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:55,945
What about the whole body?
Do I deserve it?

418
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,824
- That was too easy.
- Look at Nathalia.

419
00:19:59,824 --> 00:20:01,534
Guys, Nathalia is very crazy.

420
00:20:01,534 --> 00:20:04,704
Guys, but Nathalia... is single, right?

421
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:07,874
- She's not working, right?
- Show him, Titto, how you do it.

422
00:20:07,874 --> 00:20:09,250
- How do you do it?
- What?

423
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:10,877
Get up, show...

424
00:20:11,461 --> 00:20:13,755
Guys, I'm really shocked.

425
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:16,799
Me, too. Not with the girls,
they're working,

426
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:17,967
giving free shots like the boys.

427
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,344
I'm loving it.

428
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:20,929
They're doing exactly
what the guys are doing.

429
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:23,348
No, they're doing much more.

430
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:24,432
Yes.

431
00:20:24,432 --> 00:20:27,226
They're doing that
because they're working, right?

432
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,770
Let's watch the afterparty.

433
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,813
I'm shocked with the guys.

434
00:20:30,813 --> 00:20:33,983
- They wanna hook up with everybody.
- But those women...

435
00:20:33,983 --> 00:20:35,610
I think the girls are amazing.

436
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,154
They are so amazing. They are empowered.

437
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:41,199
- They are empowered.
- They are role models for Brazil.

438
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:42,450
You are amazing.

439
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,868
I'm not going to say much...

440
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:47,413
I think those guys
they took home are tidier

441
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:49,374
than the guys from the house.

442
00:20:49,374 --> 00:20:50,667
They're cute, right?

443
00:20:50,667 --> 00:20:53,044
I think we have to wait
to see the end, right?

444
00:20:53,044 --> 00:20:55,546
- Yeah, I'm going to wait to see it.
- We'll see.

445
00:21:01,970 --> 00:21:05,139
Oh, my God. It's hard to be myself.

446
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:07,100
Let's see if they're becoming friends?

447
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:08,935
We've realized they're not.

448
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,228
Yeah, let's see.

449
00:21:10,228 --> 00:21:12,271
I'm going to root against those girls.

450
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,816
- It was Thais.
- She deserved that.

451
00:21:14,816 --> 00:21:15,733
Blondie is having sex!

452
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:17,068
No way!

453
00:21:17,443 --> 00:21:20,405
- Poor thing.
- Blondie went upstairs to have sex.

454
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:22,532
Tay.

455
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:25,994
Don't do this. Tay, get up.
Let's go to bed.

456
00:21:25,994 --> 00:21:27,829
Why are you up here?

457
00:21:27,829 --> 00:21:30,081
Taynara, let's go to bed.
Get out of the floor.

458
00:21:30,081 --> 00:21:32,542
I'm fine... Why are you up here?

459
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:33,835
"Why are you up here?"

460
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:35,586
Leave me here.

461
00:21:35,712 --> 00:21:37,088
No. Go to bed.

462
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:38,965
I don't want to.

463
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:39,882
You'll make me lie down here.

464
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:41,968
The floor is the limit.

465
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:45,138
That's my saying.

466
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:46,931
"The floor is the limit.
That's my saying."

467
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:49,017
- ...lie down there and talk?
- No.

468
00:21:49,017 --> 00:21:51,144
- Just talk, don't worry, bro.
- No.

469
00:21:51,144 --> 00:21:53,479
We have a nice relationship.

470
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:56,357
- Murilo is at Art's.
- He's going to have his ass kicked.

471
00:21:56,357 --> 00:21:58,651
I won't do anything, thinking about him.

472
00:21:58,651 --> 00:22:01,487
- He's a fucker.
- Oh, my God, the butt crack...

473
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,949
What?

474
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,952
He said her boyfriend is a fucker,
he was at the club.

475
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:11,831
"I missed you, baby."
Who said that? Murilo?

476
00:22:11,831 --> 00:22:14,000
Murilo is going to catch that boy.
She's on the floor.

477
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,045
- Holy shit, that's fucked up.
- Knife in hand.

478
00:22:18,004 --> 00:22:20,882
- Cooking our food.
- Where are you from, bro?

479
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:22,425
- I don't believe this.
- What's this?

480
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,512
Where's Tay?

481
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:27,764
"Where's Tay?"

482
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:31,434
- She's sleeping.
- Great, that's good.

483
00:22:31,434 --> 00:22:32,727
"That's good" and he...

484
00:22:32,727 --> 00:22:34,145
The guy is on the floor...

485
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:35,271
Go check on Tay, go!

486
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:36,647
This is like a soap opera.

487
00:22:36,647 --> 00:22:40,568
Only if you go to bed, man.
Man, go to bed.

488
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:41,819
Damn it.

489
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:43,780
That's going to be fucked up.

490
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:44,864
Which guy annoyed you?

491
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:46,783
There was a guy up there,

492
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:48,910
I was sleeping, and he was there.

493
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:52,330
Who was the guy who was upsetting my girl?

494
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,957
- Was it you?
- Go figure...

495
00:22:54,957 --> 00:22:56,250
I was just seeing your house.

496
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,377
Was it you? Then bounce, my friend,

497
00:22:58,377 --> 00:23:00,630
or there's going
to be some ass kicking here.

498
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:04,050
She's just said there was a guy
upsetting her, she wanted to sleep.

499
00:23:04,050 --> 00:23:05,301
Who's your chick?

500
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:06,719
I don't want to know who is.

501
00:23:06,844 --> 00:23:10,640
You know the party where you were at?
I'm the one who plays there, man.

502
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,850
- So, please...
- I was playing there.

503
00:23:13,267 --> 00:23:16,646
Fuck, what a guy!
Boy, you really did it now.

504
00:23:16,646 --> 00:23:19,315
Why haven't they left yet?
I'm starting to go crazy.

505
00:23:19,315 --> 00:23:21,317
- Please, get out.
- Respect is essential.

506
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:23,152
Or else there'll be a fight.

507
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:25,863
- There'll be a fight.
- Why? No, I'm saying that...

508
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:28,449
I'm going to call you an Uber.

509
00:23:28,449 --> 00:23:30,868
I love Murilo.
Damn, Murilo is fucking awesome.

510
00:23:30,993 --> 00:23:34,789
Jeez, I felt like a little girl
hearing Murilo.

511
00:23:34,789 --> 00:23:36,624
Like, he's defending me!

512
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:37,625
Wow.

513
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:41,879
Until you explain that
things are not what they seem...

514
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:45,091
He always talks about these things.

515
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:46,425
Things that don't exist.

516
00:23:46,425 --> 00:23:51,514
But I think, at first, I'd be pissed off,
seeing the girls there, in the middle...

517
00:23:51,514 --> 00:23:53,391
Then you have to know
what happened.

518
00:23:53,391 --> 00:23:55,059
Man, I wouldn't stay.

519
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:58,688
If you came home and saw
your boy with a lot of women there...

520
00:23:58,688 --> 00:24:00,857
- I'd be pissed off.
- Can I say something?

521
00:24:00,857 --> 00:24:03,818
- Are you nuts?
- It's wrong. What?

522
00:24:03,818 --> 00:24:05,653
Can I say something?

523
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:06,988
Would you leave pissed off?

524
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:09,490
I'd smash the bed, flip the table and say,

525
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:12,201
"What the fuck do you think this is, man?"

526
00:24:12,577 --> 00:24:16,455
I understand he can feel
attracted to other people...

527
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,708
But, man, I wouldn't care.

528
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,626
- You don't care?
- Would you allow it?

529
00:24:20,626 --> 00:24:23,171
- You seeing your boy hitting on...
- I'd be cool.

530
00:24:23,171 --> 00:24:25,756
Because I know...
If I really like the guy.

531
00:24:25,756 --> 00:24:28,009
I'm talking about me, okay?
I've been there.

532
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:30,720
If I like a guy, and he likes me,
I know we like each other.

533
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:33,389
I know that's his environment,
the party scene.

534
00:24:33,389 --> 00:24:36,475
I know he might be there,
enjoying himself.

535
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:40,521
Deep down, he likes me. So it's like,
"Baby? What's going on? Let's go, honey.

536
00:24:40,521 --> 00:24:43,774
- What about all these chicks?"
- Stop it, don't do this.

537
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:46,194
We'll be laughing about it.
That's it, man.

538
00:24:46,319 --> 00:24:48,279
So, you think cheating is okay?

539
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:50,198
Physical attraction is one thing...

540
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:51,782
Attraction, not betraying.

541
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:52,992
People feel attracted...

542
00:24:52,992 --> 00:24:54,452
But attraction is not cheating?

543
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:56,621
People are not, what do we...

544
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:59,123
Yeah, when we like one person?

545
00:24:59,123 --> 00:25:00,374
- Monogamous.
- Monogamous.

546
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:02,877
It's natural we feel attracted to others.

547
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:03,794
Yes.

548
00:25:03,794 --> 00:25:05,796
Having the option to hook up
with another person

549
00:25:05,796 --> 00:25:08,549
is totally different from just attraction.

550
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:12,803
Murilo got there, saw some men
and wanted to cause trouble.

551
00:25:12,803 --> 00:25:14,722
- No, he didn't.
- No, he got there...

552
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:16,891
He got there making jokes about the food.

553
00:25:16,891 --> 00:25:18,643
"Where's my woman?"

554
00:25:18,643 --> 00:25:21,103
He got there,
"The guys are eating my food."

555
00:25:21,103 --> 00:25:22,897
Then he asked, "Where's my woman?"

556
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:25,691
Someone said, "She's sleeping."
He said, "It's okay."

557
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,401
Making jokes. Exactly.

558
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:30,613
No, John, he was cool
considering the situation.

559
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:33,574
When he saw those
guys, he wanted to cause trouble.

560
00:25:33,574 --> 00:25:35,368
No. She was the one complaining.

561
00:25:35,368 --> 00:25:36,911
He didn't want trouble.

562
00:25:36,911 --> 00:25:39,121
I'd make a scene. I'd tell the woman this.

563
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:40,665
I think he was refined.

564
00:25:40,665 --> 00:25:42,917
Where are you going, man?

565
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:48,547
"I'm going to call you an Uber, and you're
getting in the Uber, okay? That's it."

566
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,008
What did you say?
What were you going to say?

567
00:25:51,008 --> 00:25:53,803
"I'm calling you an Uber.
You're getting in the Uber."

568
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:57,223
And she'd leave, right, Carol?

569
00:25:57,223 --> 00:26:00,101
"Get in the Uber
because it's better for you."

570
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:02,436
I don't want to go downstairs.

571
00:26:02,436 --> 00:26:04,063
If you don't take off...

572
00:26:04,063 --> 00:26:05,773
- What's this?
- If you don't take off,

573
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:07,733
I'm going to kick your ass, buddy.

574
00:26:08,442 --> 00:26:10,820
Who woke you up?

575
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,737
It was him, but...

576
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:14,115
It was him, right? He woke you up, leave.

577
00:26:15,658 --> 00:26:17,201
You can go there...

578
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:21,580
- If you don't take off...
- Of course, brother. No, no...

579
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:24,083
- Hey, is that your woman?
- Fuck you.

580
00:26:24,083 --> 00:26:26,627
- Oh, yeah?
- Take off, buddy. Get out.

581
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:28,587
No, guys, you know what?

582
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:32,425
His tone turned that into a bad situation
and that resulted in an argument.

583
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:35,553
That could have been just a conversation.

584
00:26:35,553 --> 00:26:38,139
What conversation, John?
That guy got home drunk...

585
00:26:38,139 --> 00:26:40,266
By any chance,
do you work in telemarketing?

586
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,351
I've worked. No, man.

587
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:45,563
He got home drunk.

588
00:26:45,563 --> 00:26:48,316
- Easy, buddy.
- Get out. You don't touch me.

589
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:51,569
- What happened?
- Don't touch him, man.

590
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:53,237
Don't touch me.

591
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:55,114
- Nobody is touching anybody.
- Take off.

592
00:26:55,114 --> 00:26:58,534
Fucking jerk.
We're going to finish... Look, bro...

593
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:01,495
- Are you nuts? Get out!
- Fuck you!

594
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:03,664
- Easy.

595
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:07,126
- Get out of my way.
- Easy. No.

596
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:10,129
- Take your hand off me.
- Take your hand off me.

597
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:12,590
Luan doesn't like to fight.
He's there, look.

598
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,550
Holy shit. Luan and Murilo are fighting.

599
00:27:14,550 --> 00:27:16,135
- What?
- Fuck!

600
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,596
Get your hand off me, bro.

601
00:27:18,596 --> 00:27:20,222
Fuck!

602
00:27:20,222 --> 00:27:22,308
That guy was fucking wrong.

603
00:27:22,308 --> 00:27:24,393
He did wrong.

604
00:27:25,269 --> 00:27:26,854
- Do you want to get your ass kicked?
- Are you nuts?

605
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:29,357
"Are you nuts?" Now you're really a man.

606
00:27:29,357 --> 00:27:32,109
I've never seen this, man.
Where's the fighting?

607
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:33,319
What's this, man?

608
00:27:33,319 --> 00:27:35,905
And he says, "What's this, man?
What are you doing?

609
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:38,783
What's this, man?"
You need to have your ass kicked.

610
00:27:38,783 --> 00:27:41,786
That guy was a fool to go in the bedroom.

611
00:27:41,786 --> 00:27:44,789
Why did you stay downstairs?
When Tay was sleeping?

612
00:27:44,789 --> 00:27:46,791
Was I supposed to leave them?

613
00:27:46,791 --> 00:27:49,168
- You were the hostess?
- Blondie and I...

614
00:27:49,168 --> 00:27:50,378
Everybody went to bed...

615
00:27:50,378 --> 00:27:51,921
- You and Blondie?
- Blondie and I.

616
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:54,131
I get it.
Blondie was upstairs in the room?

617
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:57,134
She was hooking up with...

618
00:27:57,134 --> 00:28:00,388
And you were alone
in the pool like a crazy person?

619
00:28:00,388 --> 00:28:03,182
Oh, my God, he kissed a lot
of girls at the rap party.

620
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:05,768
- It's such hypocrisy.
- Luan is a hustler.

621
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:08,396
Not Luan, Ramon is a fucking hustler, too.

622
00:28:08,396 --> 00:28:09,939
He's a hustler, bro.

623
00:28:09,939 --> 00:28:12,066
It's such hypocrisy, lord.

624
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:14,568
I think Blondie was a fool.
She could've left her boy there

625
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,529
because he wasn't even...

626
00:28:16,529 --> 00:28:18,489
But he's friends with them, right?

627
00:28:18,489 --> 00:28:21,700
But that's fucked up.
He wasn't involved, he was with Blondie.

628
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,577
Now you're going to mix this?

629
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:25,913
Your friend fucks things up...

630
00:28:25,913 --> 00:28:27,289
Titto is with me at a party,

631
00:28:27,289 --> 00:28:29,375
and I brought you home...

632
00:28:29,375 --> 00:28:31,585
You're going to sleep with me...

633
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:32,545
- Look.
- Obviously.

634
00:28:32,545 --> 00:28:33,712
- Really?
- Obviously.

635
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:34,755
The bubble.

636
00:28:34,755 --> 00:28:38,509
Bro, I don't know if I... Sorry,
I don't want to separate this by gender,

637
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:42,638
but where me and my friends come from,
that thing doesn't exist, bro.

638
00:28:42,638 --> 00:28:46,016
You're in this house. My five
friends and I go to a house full of women.

639
00:28:46,016 --> 00:28:48,310
Men show up
and I'm in the bedroom with a woman.

640
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:50,563
My friends get in trouble downstairs...

641
00:28:50,563 --> 00:28:52,106
Am I going to stay there?

642
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:54,733
No way, I leave with my buddies.
Are you nuts, man?

643
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,194
Okay, then.
You can lose the love of your life.

644
00:29:10,291 --> 00:29:11,125
Give me a kiss.

645
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:13,711
- That was crazy. Good night.
- You deserve it.

646
00:29:15,588 --> 00:29:16,755
Hey, the man is desperate.

647
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,382
I'm not needy. I'm independent.

648
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,010
There it is, Coach Bianca.

649
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:23,095
I can't believe... There's only...

650
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:25,139
- Oh, my God.
- What a shame.

651
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:26,557
Nothing...

652
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:28,100
- What the fuck?
- It's Rubi. My God.

653
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:30,227
There's only one more episode.

654
00:29:30,227 --> 00:29:31,479
Oh, no!

655
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:33,814
I thought she was
auditioning for a TV show.

656
00:29:33,814 --> 00:29:35,900
I can't believe it, guys.

657
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:37,443
She's an actress, man.

658
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:40,070
There's only one more episode.

659
00:29:40,613 --> 00:29:43,240
I don't want to. No...

660
00:29:45,826 --> 00:29:49,330
I need more episodes, man.

661
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:53,501
I'm not going to see Murilo banging, man.

662
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:58,005
ON THE NEXT EPISODE

663
00:29:58,005 --> 00:30:01,258
They did the same thing
to each other the whole series.

664
00:30:01,258 --> 00:30:03,802
What he did, she did, too.
She brought someone over.

665
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,304
She did something, I don't know...

666
00:30:08,349 --> 00:30:09,767
The only thing missing was a real talk.

667
00:30:09,767 --> 00:30:13,312
I didn't see any sexism.
He was just a jerk.
