1
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:16,767
We're here!

2
00:00:19,145 --> 00:00:21,147
Wow, here comes Pabllo,
look how she comes.

3
00:00:21,147 --> 00:00:23,816
This is a Victoria's Secret
fucking mother fucker!

4
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:28,988
- This is an angel.
- What's up?

5
00:00:28,988 --> 00:00:30,197
She's a Hell angel.

6
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:32,241
Where is John?

7
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:34,452
We can't pretend he's not here.

8
00:00:34,452 --> 00:00:35,536
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

9
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,289
- Look at this.
- My God!

10
00:00:41,917 --> 00:00:45,171
You say that you love me when you drink

11
00:00:45,171 --> 00:00:48,674
But your mouth prefers me

12
00:00:48,674 --> 00:00:49,967
Dear Lord, bro!

13
00:00:51,677 --> 00:00:52,845
And what

14
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:56,015
What is it, man?

15
00:00:56,015 --> 00:00:58,058
- Get up, girl.
- Oh, my gosh.

16
00:00:58,559 --> 00:00:59,935
That's great, man.

17
00:01:01,645 --> 00:01:03,689
Imagine what he would do at school...

18
00:01:03,689 --> 00:01:04,815
Look at the heels!

19
00:01:04,815 --> 00:01:06,442
With high heels?

20
00:01:06,442 --> 00:01:07,735
I thought there was...

21
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:09,278
These are phantom heels, girl!

22
00:01:09,278 --> 00:01:10,946
- And he tiptoes!
- What the fuck?

23
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:12,823
Fuck, I thought there were heels.

24
00:01:12,823 --> 00:01:14,325
Me too.

25
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:16,327
We're here together

26
00:01:16,327 --> 00:01:18,537
to watch Episode 3 of Floripa Beach House.

27
00:01:18,662 --> 00:01:20,581
Tay and João had an argument,

28
00:01:20,581 --> 00:01:22,917
she was dumped by Murilo,
bad vibe in the house.

29
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:24,418
And I don't know
what is going to happen.

30
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:26,837
What do you think, MC Carol from Niterói?

31
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:29,131
- It's real.
- It's real!

32
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:31,592
Man, I think...

33
00:01:31,592 --> 00:01:34,470
I feel bad for João, you know?
Because João...

34
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:37,014
He doesn't even know what's happening.

35
00:01:37,014 --> 00:01:38,390
Anything could happen.

36
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:40,267
When I think one thing will happen...

37
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:41,435
There was a bet...

38
00:01:41,435 --> 00:01:44,063
João, I started falling in love,
then I was disgusted,

39
00:01:44,063 --> 00:01:47,399
now I feel I'm in love with him
because he's... the fun one.

40
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,527
Tonight he's gonna get laid. He is!

41
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:52,321
I used to love Tay,
now I think she's too attached.

42
00:01:52,321 --> 00:01:54,365
I thought Tay wasn't like that,
but now she's crying.

43
00:01:54,365 --> 00:01:56,742
João ate the egg...
I only remember that.

44
00:01:56,742 --> 00:01:59,036
Tonight João is gonna get laid.

45
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,246
He ate an egg...

46
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:01,956
To fuck someone, but he didn't...

47
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:04,166
Let's pray for him tonight...

48
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,252
João cried in order to fuck somebody,

49
00:02:06,252 --> 00:02:08,671
but he didn't fuck anybody until now.

50
00:02:08,838 --> 00:02:10,798
Let's press play real good?

51
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:13,384
- Let's go! I'm very anxious.
- Go, Titto. Kill it.

52
00:02:13,384 --> 00:02:14,927
- What's up?
- What's up, ma?

53
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:50,462
WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS

54
00:03:01,515 --> 00:03:04,351
Every day, something happens...
Are you seeing this?

55
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:06,979
Yeah... I've had my share.

56
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:08,314
Enough.

57
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:09,940
One day, something happens,
next day, nothing.

58
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,942
- Thank God.
- It's the dynamite couple.

59
00:03:12,109 --> 00:03:13,110
Look, girl.

60
00:03:14,153 --> 00:03:17,865
It's better than crying in front
of the cameras saying you're heartbroken.

61
00:03:17,865 --> 00:03:20,576
Look into my eyes
and say you feel nothing.

62
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:23,037
Come on, that hurts.

63
00:03:24,246 --> 00:03:25,915
At least, it's an eye for an eye.

64
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:29,043
Crying over a broken heart,
that's a shame. Shame!

65
00:03:29,251 --> 00:03:31,545
- This ruined my life.
- Yeah.

66
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,630
Your fault, Blondie.

67
00:03:33,672 --> 00:03:34,798
The fight is on you.

68
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,759
You don't know what it's like...

69
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:40,721
Being sober. It looked like a zoo.

70
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:41,805
I didn't know what was going on.

71
00:03:41,805 --> 00:03:43,891
I didn't even know who was involved.

72
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:46,393
I knew nothing until I got home.

73
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,605
But we didn't fight there.
Not even on the bus.

74
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:52,149
- Just in the bathroom.
- You got mad at João at the bar.

75
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:54,026
You talked a lot with Bia.

76
00:03:55,152 --> 00:03:56,195
At the bar...

77
00:03:56,195 --> 00:03:57,988
I don't remember what you said...

78
00:03:57,988 --> 00:04:00,115
That's because João came to tell...

79
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,951
João was full of shit...

80
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:05,871
Then I said,
"I can't believe he did that..."

81
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:06,914
He told me a lot of bullshit.

82
00:04:06,914 --> 00:04:09,083
I asked Bia,
"So, why didn't you tell me?"

83
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,043
I really don't know.

84
00:04:11,043 --> 00:04:12,544
You said I wasn't being judged.

85
00:04:12,544 --> 00:04:13,796
That pissed me off.

86
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:16,966
Why did you tell me that
if it was supposed to come from Murilo?

87
00:04:18,217 --> 00:04:19,885
- You didn't let me talk.
- That's it...

88
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,720
You didn't have to mention it there.

89
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,431
You got drunk, wasted,
you were drinking, ready to...

90
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:25,599
What am I gonna do?

91
00:04:25,599 --> 00:04:27,559
You didn't have to mention it there.

92
00:04:27,559 --> 00:04:28,727
...talk about something

93
00:04:28,727 --> 00:04:29,728
that would make things worse?

94
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,814
We definitely would've had
a serious fight.

95
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:34,775
- Yeah... Sure.
- A very serious fight.

96
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,610
It was a misunderstanding, okay?

97
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,195
Yes. A misunderstanding.

98
00:04:38,195 --> 00:04:40,572
- People are thinking...
- You got it all wrong.

99
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:41,699
That's why I asked you!

100
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:43,534
You got mad 'cause I asked you a question.

101
00:04:43,534 --> 00:04:45,452
- It was an affirmation.
- It was just a question.

102
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:48,288
That's okay. I told you
what had to be said. It's over.

103
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,582
But you told me a lot of things...

104
00:04:50,582 --> 00:04:53,961
Then you said to me...
We didn't achieve anything.

105
00:04:53,961 --> 00:04:55,713
Anything out of love.

106
00:04:55,713 --> 00:04:57,423
Not even out of friendship?

107
00:04:57,423 --> 00:04:59,675
- Was everything in vain?
- No, that's right.

108
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:02,594
- Was everything in vain?
- Not everything was in vain.

109
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:04,763
- It was your question.
- The problem was the tone.

110
00:05:04,763 --> 00:05:06,807
I answered what I understood, you know?

111
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:11,770
It looked like everything was in vain.
And that hurt. I said,

112
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:13,981
"Wow, am I being played?"

113
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:38,881
- I don't judge what you did.
- Me neither.

114
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:42,009
- Work cell phone.
- Cell phone.

115
00:05:42,134 --> 00:05:43,135
Where's the phone?

116
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:45,971
How do I answer it?

117
00:05:46,889 --> 00:05:49,058
- Hello?
- Who is this?

118
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:50,893
Hold on. That's hard.

119
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:53,228
It's Amanda!

120
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:54,730
Is it for you?

121
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,066
It's for me!

122
00:06:00,486 --> 00:06:02,154
- Hi, girl!
- Are you all right?

123
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:04,698
- I am, what about you?
- I'm fine.

124
00:06:04,948 --> 00:06:07,659
I bought a ticket to Floripa.

125
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:08,827
I don't...

126
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:13,582
I got invitations for a nightclub party.
It's called Art's...

127
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:17,795
We're gonna go to this party.

128
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:22,132
I have nowhere to stay.

129
00:06:22,132 --> 00:06:23,258
Stay here.

130
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:25,677
It's crazy, girl...

131
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:27,721
When do you get here? Already?

132
00:06:27,721 --> 00:06:30,349
I'm boarding, yes. I'm boarding...

133
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,393
- Okay.
- I'm gonna get there real soon.

134
00:06:33,977 --> 00:06:34,978
Okay.

135
00:06:34,978 --> 00:06:36,146
I'm gonna stay there.

136
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:37,856
- Can I stay there?
- Of course.

137
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:40,025
Tell the guys I'm arriving.

138
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,528
But I gotta rush, I gotta catch a flight.

139
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:44,530
- Okay.
- All right?

140
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:46,240
I love you so much!

141
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,700
- I love you. Bye.
- Bye.

142
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,993
Bye.

143
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,580
Guys, she's coming.

144
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:54,706
What did she say?

145
00:06:54,706 --> 00:06:56,583
That she's catching a flight...

146
00:06:56,583 --> 00:06:57,793
She's catching a flight?

147
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,419
She has nowhere to go...

148
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:01,171
- Did you offer her to stay here?
- She's staying here.

149
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,632
- Man!
- Fuck! She's staying here?

150
00:07:05,676 --> 00:07:09,847
She said there's a top party
for us to go dancing.

151
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:38,625
May the night be unforgettable!

152
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,586
It's gonna be!

153
00:07:40,586 --> 00:07:42,713
May it be better than yesterday
and worse than tomorrow!

154
00:07:43,297 --> 00:07:48,135
May theirs be ours, may ours be ours...

155
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:49,386
We own it!

156
00:08:03,233 --> 00:08:04,943
Just in time, man!

157
00:08:05,068 --> 00:08:07,279
A toast for Amanda, guys!

158
00:08:08,155 --> 00:08:09,239
This is yours.

159
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:10,616
Cheers! Go!

160
00:08:11,825 --> 00:08:12,826
We own it!

161
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,745
Tonight special guest!

162
00:08:14,745 --> 00:08:15,954
God, that's crazy!

163
00:08:16,663 --> 00:08:18,624
Do you like the same things Tay does?

164
00:08:18,957 --> 00:08:20,292
Dancing on the table?

165
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:21,335
Falling off all the time?

166
00:08:21,335 --> 00:08:25,380
I love a stage...
I love being the star... Please?

167
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,507
Take me as I am.

168
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:28,926
Do you fall to the ground?

169
00:08:30,135 --> 00:08:31,303
Girl!

170
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:33,764
We are going by bus.
It's a party bus, got it?

171
00:08:33,764 --> 00:08:35,098
I wanna know everything!

172
00:08:35,098 --> 00:08:36,600
...sure I was gonna cry?

173
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,894
I did because the boy doesn't like me.

174
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:40,646
- I cried because I was in love.

175
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:42,689
- What boy?
- He went to have a smoke.

176
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,400
Remember I said
I kissed a boy in São Paulo?

177
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:47,236
At São Paulo's party?

178
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:49,279
- What?
- It's him. He's here.

179
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,490
It's the cute one with... Yeah...

180
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,950
I get it.

181
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,660
Who do you think I hook up with
in this house?

182
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:56,870
Now I get it.

183
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:58,455
Used to hook up or still do?

184
00:08:58,956 --> 00:09:00,916
- Everything makes sense.
- You used to.

185
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:01,959
It's in the past.

186
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,878
You know, guys are like that.

187
00:09:05,504 --> 00:09:08,715
First, he won't want it,
then he'll fall at your feet.

188
00:09:09,258 --> 00:09:11,426
You'll see. It's always like that.

189
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,975
It's not that he doesn't want it.
We're hooking up since day one.

190
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:19,935
I think you've got to set yourself free.

191
00:09:19,935 --> 00:09:22,688
I'm not in the mood.
Our relationship is going great.

192
00:09:22,688 --> 00:09:24,398
It's like...

193
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:28,235
There has been no boy like this...

194
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:30,195
So you're the house couple...

195
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:32,072
No, everybody has someone.

196
00:09:32,447 --> 00:09:33,991
João is the only one...

197
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:35,867
Everybody has someone?

198
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,828
I'm going to hook up with the boys.

199
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:39,246
From this house?

200
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:41,081
You're gonna get in trouble.

201
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,624
- What?
- Not from this house, right?

202
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,418
- What do you mean?
- Everybody is committed.

203
00:09:44,418 --> 00:09:45,836
You want to hook up
with all the boys here?

204
00:09:45,836 --> 00:09:46,962
Aren't you my friend?

205
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:48,255
Girl, don't start!

206
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:49,756
Don't start what, Taynara?

207
00:09:49,756 --> 00:09:52,634
I'll be here for two days.
Do you think I care about those girls?

208
00:09:52,843 --> 00:09:53,844
Girl!

209
00:10:01,852 --> 00:10:03,437
Hey! Go downstairs, fuck?

210
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:05,188
- Who are you?
- She's getting ready.

211
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:06,481
- This is Ramon.
- Ramon.

212
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:09,526
- Nice to meet you. Welcome.
- Thank you.

213
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:10,527
Let's go downstairs?

214
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,404
- This is pinkish...
- Are you doing the makeup?

215
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:13,405
No, I'm going to...

216
00:10:13,405 --> 00:10:15,324
I'm trying to find a lipstick...

217
00:10:15,324 --> 00:10:16,825
I'm going downstairs...

218
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,577
Do you wanna use lipstick too?

219
00:10:19,369 --> 00:10:20,412
Do you wanna...

220
00:10:20,537 --> 00:10:21,830
take my lipstick off?

221
00:10:22,497 --> 00:10:23,540
Stop it.

222
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,126
And don't get close to Murilo,
or I'm gonna beat you.

223
00:10:37,763 --> 00:10:39,681
Let's go, Blondie. Let's go, Bia.

224
00:10:40,349 --> 00:10:42,100
- Let's go, let's go.
- Let's go.

225
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:48,357
You smell nice.

226
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:52,194
Fuck! Each one... Let's thank...

227
00:11:43,537 --> 00:11:44,704
You got to enjoy it!

228
00:11:44,704 --> 00:11:48,834
Fuck, you got to enjoy it!
That's it! Let's enjoy it, come!

229
00:11:55,507 --> 00:11:56,591
What's wrong?

230
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:58,760
- Nothing. I'm fucked here.
- Speak, now!

231
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,928
She wanted to fuck.

232
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:02,264
That girl?

233
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:04,599
Go fuck yourself, okay?

234
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:05,934
I was just being nice.

235
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:08,937
I was dancing.

236
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,482
Don't start with this. For Christ's sake.

237
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,401
I'm gonna kiss you.

238
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:33,587
Girl, how do I enjoy it?

239
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:34,754
Don't hook up with my boy.

240
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:36,631
Right? You won't hook up with...

241
00:12:37,424 --> 00:12:39,050
If you do it with my boy...

242
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,096
Are you hooking up with my boy?

243
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:44,890
Easy, girl. It's not like that.

244
00:12:44,890 --> 00:12:46,141
We're best friends forever.

245
00:12:46,141 --> 00:12:47,476
This boy is yours.

246
00:12:47,476 --> 00:12:50,437
But, man, think about it...

247
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:53,773
I'm a little interested
in hooking up with your boy.

248
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:59,654
But nevermind, this boy is not yours.
This boy is... He gets to...

249
00:13:05,202 --> 00:13:07,454
I said, "It's great being here.

250
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:08,705
"Man, just enjoy it.

251
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,875
"Just don't hook up with my boy."

252
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:15,879
Then she said, "No, but..."

253
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:19,424
I said, "If you do it..."

254
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:22,344
Girl, I'm sorry, but she's clueless.

255
00:13:22,344 --> 00:13:23,553
I said this to her.

256
00:13:32,521 --> 00:13:33,647
What?

257
00:13:39,819 --> 00:13:41,196
What were you talking about?

258
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:42,781
We were getting along.

259
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:45,283
Good, because you've made a little mess.

260
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:46,993
- What did I come here for?
- Not this way.

261
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,205
Girl, you know me, right? I'm a Leo, baby.

262
00:13:50,205 --> 00:13:52,791
But you're not respecting
the couples, girl.

263
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:53,833
That's it, girl.

264
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,960
We've just gotten along.

265
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,127
Good, but it was close.

266
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:58,463
- It wasn't. Girl...
- It was. She told me.

267
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:02,259
If it were you, being jealous
like you are of a boy and a chick...

268
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:03,677
I'm not jealous, man.

269
00:14:03,677 --> 00:14:04,803
If a pretty chick said,

270
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:05,929
"I wanna kiss your boy,"

271
00:14:05,929 --> 00:14:07,347
you'd say,
"Feel free to kiss him"?

272
00:14:07,347 --> 00:14:08,807
You are all too committed.

273
00:14:08,807 --> 00:14:10,600
You can't judge others, girl.

274
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:13,645
You are all too committed.
This has got to stop, just a little.

275
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:15,772
You don't know what they're going through.

276
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,210
Now I'm enjoying it. We'll talk later.

277
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:45,093
Let me see you standing.

278
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,637
Awesome.

279
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,514
Give me this.

280
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,184
She's going to the after party.

281
00:14:53,768 --> 00:14:56,354
You must be five foot eight-point-five.

282
00:14:56,605 --> 00:14:57,689
I'm wearing heels.

283
00:14:57,981 --> 00:14:59,274
Five feet three inches.

284
00:14:59,941 --> 00:15:01,151
Five feet six.

285
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:02,819
I can't get it right tonight.

286
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:03,987
You got it wrong.

287
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:06,072
She's very hot. Didn't I tell you, bro?

288
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:07,949
Kiss her.

289
00:15:26,217 --> 00:15:27,302
I kissed her.

290
00:15:43,526 --> 00:15:46,863
- Can you get me a cigarette?
- Yes.

291
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:48,031
And a kiss?

292
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:50,909
I can, too.

293
00:15:51,326 --> 00:15:52,535
Are we allowed to kiss?

294
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:06,383
I'm wearing red lipstick,
it's gonna get all smudged.

295
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:07,884
Your red lipstick stained me...

296
00:16:07,884 --> 00:16:09,052
Did you get me smudged?

297
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:10,053
I did.

298
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:13,807
Is it too bad? I already kissed.

299
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:15,850
- Serious?
- Jesus.

300
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:16,976
God is good.

301
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,245
Let's bounce.

302
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:43,628
Do we have a deal?

303
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:54,389
Rad!

304
00:16:56,850 --> 00:16:58,435
This was the real deal.

305
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:15,118
I wanna know when I am having a good day.

306
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:20,498
I don't want anything to do with Nath.

307
00:17:20,832 --> 00:17:22,625
You didn't do anything tonight, right?

308
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:23,626
Exactly.

309
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,628
I told her. She's imagining stuff.

310
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:26,629
I didn't do anything to...

311
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:30,091
You didn't. I saw you were very quiet.
You just danced with me.

312
00:17:30,091 --> 00:17:31,384
I danced with...

313
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:34,345
With my friends. Just friendship.
No bad intentions.

314
00:17:34,345 --> 00:17:35,388
I just danced.

315
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:39,142
If she took it badly, she's got to know
we're all free, you know?

316
00:17:39,142 --> 00:17:43,563
The thing is... Exactly, you can't stop
dancing with people because she's jealous.

317
00:17:43,563 --> 00:17:44,856
She's got to control it.

318
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:47,859
I'm all right,
but she ruined the fucking party.

319
00:17:47,859 --> 00:17:50,612
I went there to have a good time,
then she just sits,

320
00:17:51,112 --> 00:17:53,031
- cries, then...
- Hey, mister.

321
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:54,282
Girl, come here.

322
00:17:54,282 --> 00:17:55,700
I don't wanna talk, Nathalia.

323
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,619
- You have to apologize to him.
- Why?

324
00:17:57,619 --> 00:17:59,996
You were wrong.
You are judging him, he did nothing.

325
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:01,581
I'm not judging anybody, bro.

326
00:18:01,581 --> 00:18:03,333
I don't believe you.
Why were you crying?

327
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,835
- Why did you cry?
- You said the woman was a whore.

328
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:06,961
Didn't you say it?

329
00:18:07,253 --> 00:18:08,630
You said it, I heard you.

330
00:18:08,922 --> 00:18:10,924
You said her friend wanted
to hook up with me.

331
00:18:10,924 --> 00:18:16,971
Girl, he just danced with friends.
Stop acting crazy.

332
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:19,557
He respected you all the time.

333
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:22,644
As long as he just kisses you, it's okay.

334
00:18:28,066 --> 00:18:30,401
Go away, Nathalia.
I'm serious. We'll talk later.

335
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:32,487
- But I wanna talk.
- Go away.

336
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:33,738
I don't wanna talk now.

337
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:36,741
I'm mad, I don't wanna talk right now.

338
00:18:36,741 --> 00:18:38,576
- Mad at what?
- Will you leave me alone?

339
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:39,953
Will you leave me alone?

340
00:18:40,703 --> 00:18:42,247
So, go, we'll talk later.

341
00:18:43,164 --> 00:18:44,916
I'm asking you, get up.

342
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:52,507
You kissed a lot of people, didn't you?

343
00:18:52,507 --> 00:18:54,801
- You kissed seven people.
- Seven?

344
00:18:54,801 --> 00:18:56,302
- I counted. It was seven.
- Seven?

345
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,679
I said I'm a kisser.

346
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,097
Not a fucker, a kisser.

347
00:18:59,097 --> 00:19:00,348
...I think it was too much.

348
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:03,685
- You kissed seven people.
- I bang a few, but I do it real good.

349
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:09,232
- They were all together, right?
- Right.

350
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:11,609
- One at a time, right?
- How many people did you kiss?

351
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,236
That's none of your business.

352
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:14,654
So many...

353
00:19:15,405 --> 00:19:17,073
You're being rude to me?

354
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,033
I don't even wanna talk to you.

355
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:20,743
Respect my brother here.

356
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,164
But the chicks that were here left?

357
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,583
Did you kiss one of them?

358
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,251
I just kissed one person.

359
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:30,378
- No, you kissed the ginger.
- Just a peck.

360
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,088
- No real kissing.
- It was a French kiss.

361
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,131
It was a peck.

362
00:19:33,131 --> 00:19:34,173
In front of me.

363
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,009
She bit my lip and I left. I said, "No."

364
00:19:36,217 --> 00:19:37,552
No, you used your tongue.

365
00:19:37,552 --> 00:19:39,554
No, I just kissed one person.
One mouth.

366
00:19:39,554 --> 00:19:41,180
Come on, bro. I saw it.

367
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:45,977
- Liar. Such a fucking liar.
- You're mistaken.

368
00:19:45,977 --> 00:19:47,145
You kissed in front of me.

369
00:19:47,145 --> 00:19:48,229
Who is a liar? Me?

370
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:50,523
No, she's... No, girl... No...

371
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,191
People... It wasn't like that.

372
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,151
That was it, you know?

373
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:55,528
He just said I'm a liar.

374
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:56,779
Let me have a smoke.

375
00:19:56,779 --> 00:19:58,072
You know what's worse?

376
00:19:58,072 --> 00:20:00,283
I kissed one person,
I'm not gonna expose the chick.

377
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:03,119
I told you. I told you he kissed.

378
00:20:03,119 --> 00:20:04,871
Fuck off. I respected you.

379
00:20:04,871 --> 00:20:06,956
- And I didn't respect you?
- You know shit.

380
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:09,125
- Didn't I?
- You don't know the half of it.

381
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:11,252
- Didn't I respect you?
- You don't know the half of it.

382
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,588
You're a fake. I'm disgusted.

383
00:20:13,588 --> 00:20:15,465
Please. I'm gonna go...

384
00:20:15,465 --> 00:20:16,966
...you got to impose respect.

385
00:20:16,966 --> 00:20:18,259
Want to be respected?

386
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:21,220
If you can't handle it,
don't get involved. Don't bother me.

387
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,388
Don't bother me.

388
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,396
Hey, people, for Christ's sake.

389
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,357
I think both of them are right, guys.

390
00:20:32,357 --> 00:20:34,901
When you wanna affect someone,
you can't do it to the person.

391
00:20:34,901 --> 00:20:40,406
You got to do it with their best friend.

392
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,533
Hook up with someone
in front of their friend.

393
00:20:42,992 --> 00:20:45,328
They will think you don't give a shit.

394
00:20:45,495 --> 00:20:47,538
Carol, you got it right, you know?

395
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,333
- I'm in shock...
- I'm a strategist.

396
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:51,709
Her only mistake was crying.

397
00:20:52,001 --> 00:20:54,128
I think she should have done this,

398
00:20:54,671 --> 00:20:57,924
"You don't want me anymore?
Cool, let's be friends."

399
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:00,385
- Tay, right?
-"I'm cool."

400
00:21:00,927 --> 00:21:04,889
Then she would hook up with some guy
in front of João... She's damn right.

401
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,474
- Make him mad.
- He's... Yeah.

402
00:21:06,474 --> 00:21:07,433
Way to go.

403
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:08,643
Let me tell you...

404
00:21:08,643 --> 00:21:10,937
- Now, he's gonna want her more.
- I don't know.

405
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:12,855
He is.

406
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:15,149
Not now, in a while.

407
00:21:15,149 --> 00:21:17,110
This anger is out of desire, honey.

408
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:18,695
He wants to fuck her again.

409
00:21:18,695 --> 00:21:19,862
This is João, who cries.

410
00:21:19,862 --> 00:21:21,823
It's a risky game

411
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:24,784
because it's gonna get bad...
She won't take it.

412
00:21:24,784 --> 00:21:27,078
We'll see if she's gonna take it or not.

413
00:21:27,078 --> 00:21:28,621
Maybe she just wants to...

414
00:21:28,621 --> 00:21:30,456
She wants him.

415
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:33,543
Because she meant to hook up
in front of João, she meant to show off.

416
00:21:33,543 --> 00:21:34,752
...in front of her?

417
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:37,672
No. Let's see if he's gonna do the same.
If he does,

418
00:21:37,672 --> 00:21:40,967
it's because he's pissed,
he also has feelings.

419
00:21:40,967 --> 00:21:43,386
But we got to see
if she can take it, right?

420
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:45,263
An expert, Carol is an expert.

421
00:21:45,263 --> 00:21:46,931
- That's because he can do it.
- She's a bitch!

422
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:49,934
He could have used a strategy, too,
because he likes her.

423
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:52,645
He pretended not to like her anymore

424
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:57,316
to see what she was gonna do about it,
to make her like him even more, you know?

425
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:59,360
Where was this monster hidden?

426
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:03,781
Where? It was asleep,
the giant has woken up!

427
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,908
This is too complicated, guys.

428
00:22:05,908 --> 00:22:06,993
Nobody is really committed,

429
00:22:06,993 --> 00:22:09,912
there are no deals.
He said he didn't like her that much.

430
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,414
He told her he doesn't want her...

431
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:14,292
He doesn't want her anymore,
he has no feelings...

432
00:22:14,292 --> 00:22:16,169
I wonder if this is about ego, too.

433
00:22:16,169 --> 00:22:17,920
Only if he's playing like Carol said...

434
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,882
But it's about ego, too.
Nobody likes to be switched, right?

435
00:22:20,882 --> 00:22:22,008
It's not even about love...

436
00:22:22,008 --> 00:22:25,136
- Ego, yeah.
- I'd rather switch than being switched.

437
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:26,804
Do you know what I think?

438
00:22:27,096 --> 00:22:29,682
The show is gonna end and they're
gonna be together forever.

439
00:22:29,682 --> 00:22:30,683
I think the same way.

440
00:22:30,683 --> 00:22:33,478
I think they're not.
They're gonna fight again,

441
00:22:33,478 --> 00:22:34,979
because... Holy shit, right?

442
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:36,731
One of them kissed
in front of the other...

443
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:38,066
I hope they sleep together.

444
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:39,108
I, Kimberly, think they're gonna...

445
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:40,318
- Who are you?
- Kimberly.

446
00:22:40,777 --> 00:22:42,487
I think they're not gonna have sex...

447
00:22:42,487 --> 00:22:45,239
But it's not gonna be a good relationship.

448
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:46,866
Do you think they're gonna do it tonight?

449
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:50,078
I think they're still mad at each other.

450
00:22:50,078 --> 00:22:53,081
- But, clearly, they like each other.
- They like each other.

451
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:55,291
Both of them are in a bad situation.

452
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:57,794
- I love his opinions.
- Man, it's ugly.

453
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:00,296
It gets bad, but they get hornier.

454
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:11,057
What do you say we go for a ride?
Drive Amanda to the airport?

455
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,141
I'm gonna have to do this.

456
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:13,684
- Come with me?
- Yes.

457
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:16,896
Do you? Just the girls today.
We need this.

458
00:23:16,896 --> 00:23:17,939
What are you gonna do?

459
00:23:18,189 --> 00:23:19,273
I don't know.

460
00:23:19,273 --> 00:23:21,067
Let's go for a ride, just the guys.

461
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:23,069
Let's go to the beach.

462
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:25,279
No, just stay here... In peace, bro.

463
00:23:27,865 --> 00:23:28,866
In peace.

464
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:30,368
- You can relax.
- Don't take too long.

465
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:32,578
If you take too long, we'll be late.

466
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:01,274
Welcome to my spaceship.

467
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:03,317
Where everything happens.

468
00:24:11,075 --> 00:24:13,744
I used to say men are fragile.

469
00:24:13,744 --> 00:24:15,872
But I didn't know it was like that.

470
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:17,874
- No, guys...
- Fucking sensitive.

471
00:24:17,874 --> 00:24:19,876
No... It's all wrong.

472
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:21,377
- I swear.
- It's all wrong.

473
00:24:21,377 --> 00:24:22,420
It's all wrong.

474
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,213
Again, girls proved they're badasses.

475
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,883
And men are useless.

476
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,052
Yesterday, what happened to Murilo
was beautiful.

477
00:24:30,052 --> 00:24:33,973
One day I cried,
the other day he was pissed.

478
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:37,852
Everything that goes around
comes around, honey.

479
00:24:38,853 --> 00:24:39,896
Grandma used to say,

480
00:24:39,896 --> 00:24:43,274
"Men are only good for sex,
then you walk away."

481
00:24:43,858 --> 00:24:47,403
I already said, "Use their body
and toss them away."

482
00:24:57,663 --> 00:24:58,664
It's time.

483
00:24:59,457 --> 00:25:00,333
It's time, girl.

484
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:01,459
Time to say goodbye.

485
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,214
That's it.

486
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:09,091
Thanks for having me.

487
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:11,552
Thanks for us. That's so us.

488
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:13,638
- Good luck to you, guys.
- Thank you.

489
00:25:13,638 --> 00:25:16,724
- Be yourselves... It was good to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

490
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,019
Take care, girl, right?

491
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:25,733
Don't let that boy fuck with you.
Be yourself and put him in his place.

492
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:26,859
- All right?
- I already did.

493
00:25:27,109 --> 00:25:29,278
- Love you, girl. Bye!
- Bye!

494
00:25:29,737 --> 00:25:31,197
- Bye.
- Bye.

495
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:45,253
Come on...

496
00:25:45,253 --> 00:25:46,671
I don't wanna tease you,

497
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:49,257
but where are my brothers?

498
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:50,633
What's the deal with you?

499
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,635
- I'm around...
- You saw yesterday...

500
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:55,137
I'm coming back.

501
00:25:55,137 --> 00:25:57,181
It's over. You could be like him, right?

502
00:25:58,224 --> 00:26:00,851
Not fucking... You had to be
like this, too, right?

503
00:26:00,851 --> 00:26:02,645
- I was alone there.
- Yeah.

504
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,947
I'm not in the mood to talk to Ramon.

505
00:26:12,947 --> 00:26:14,448
It should stay the way it is.

506
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:16,242
Nothing's gonna change anyway.

507
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:18,160
I think you should talk, girl.

508
00:26:18,452 --> 00:26:20,496
How do I talk to Murilo?

509
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:23,291
I think... You should make this clear,
you know?

510
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:25,293
It's impossible
to understand you and Murilo.

511
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:26,294
- Yeah.
- Right.

512
00:26:26,294 --> 00:26:28,963
Murilo is impossible to understand.
No way we can talk.

513
00:26:28,963 --> 00:26:31,799
Yeah... But if he keeps...

514
00:26:31,799 --> 00:26:32,883
Treating me badly...

515
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:36,304
Then you... If this is bothering you,
you go and, I don't know.

516
00:26:36,304 --> 00:26:39,640
Until now, it's not.
I'd rather he doesn't look me in the face.

517
00:26:49,191 --> 00:26:50,151
What do you wanna do today?

518
00:26:50,818 --> 00:26:53,195
Bro... It's a fucking beautiful day...

519
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:55,281
Beach, please, let's go to Praia do Rosa.

520
00:26:55,281 --> 00:26:58,034
Do you remember the place we saw?
There are dunes nearby, bro.

521
00:26:58,034 --> 00:26:59,076
There are... Jesus...

522
00:26:59,076 --> 00:27:00,786
There are some wild dunes,
we can go sandboarding there.

523
00:27:00,786 --> 00:27:01,912
We can go for a ride, you know?

524
00:27:01,912 --> 00:27:03,414
Jesus, that's my dream, bro!

525
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:11,881
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

526
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:14,008
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

527
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:16,844
Do you wanna talk?
We talk at the dunes, kiddo!

528
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:20,181
- Let's go!
- Damn!

529
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:57,885
Look at those flip-flops!

530
00:28:00,429 --> 00:28:01,722
Wonderful!

531
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:06,310
Who's gonna fall on the sand today?

532
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,104
Me!

533
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:44,557
Let's give it up for this TV show!

534
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:47,101
Fuck, Universe! Thanks!

535
00:28:47,101 --> 00:28:48,352
Where's my hug, family?

536
00:28:49,562 --> 00:28:50,813
It's the beginning...

537
00:28:51,105 --> 00:28:52,731
Thanks!

538
00:29:11,041 --> 00:29:13,210
Tonight, the party is gonna be huge.

539
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:15,379
300 is one of the best parties in Floripa.

540
00:29:15,963 --> 00:29:17,673
You're gonna get wasted.

541
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,217
Get ready, bro, this party is crazy.

542
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:21,719
It's crazy.

543
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:40,821
- Are you going in the kitchen?
- What do you want?

544
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:43,365
I wanted you to warm up
the food in the microwave.

545
00:29:43,365 --> 00:29:45,284
- And take it out.
- I'll do it. Sure.

546
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:46,785
Thanks.

547
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,289
She hasn't eaten yet?

548
00:29:51,707 --> 00:29:52,666
She hasn't, bro.

549
00:29:53,334 --> 00:29:54,585
I love your dress, Blondie.

550
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:56,170
- Do you?
- It fits you perfectly.

551
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:57,838
- Like a whore.
- Color of skin.

552
00:29:58,297 --> 00:29:59,381
No.

553
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,091
Get the tableware.

554
00:30:02,259 --> 00:30:04,094
My coccyx hurts a lot
because of that dune.

555
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,096
What is it, Blondie?

556
00:30:06,514 --> 00:30:08,724
You're eating because tonight
you're gonna get it.

557
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:12,061
Tonight I'm gonna get it, João.

558
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:16,732
Now we're talking.

559
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:18,442
I like the mess.

560
00:30:25,574 --> 00:30:27,076
Tonight you're playing at home.

561
00:30:27,076 --> 00:30:28,202
What?

562
00:30:28,702 --> 00:30:30,579
Tonight you're playing in your habitat.

563
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:33,123
Big party?

564
00:30:33,999 --> 00:30:35,000
Big party.

565
00:30:35,751 --> 00:30:37,169
- Cheers, Blondie.
- Cheers.

566
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:38,504
You're looking good.

567
00:30:40,172 --> 00:30:41,257
Say it to me, Blondie.

568
00:30:41,257 --> 00:30:43,926
- I can't take it this way.
- You're looking good, João!

569
00:30:50,474 --> 00:30:54,103
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

570
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:03,529
Hello, kid!

571
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:05,072
I'm coming!

572
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:07,658
Hold our baby here, baby.

573
00:31:32,016 --> 00:31:33,183
A toast!

574
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:35,185
To this night.

575
00:31:35,185 --> 00:31:38,063
Wonderful!

576
00:32:08,218 --> 00:32:10,846
Let's go fucking crazy!

577
00:32:18,062 --> 00:32:20,522
You're very beautiful.

578
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:23,025
Really... You're a wonderful woman.

579
00:32:23,025 --> 00:32:25,819
- Do you think?
- No, I'm sure, bro.

580
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:28,322
You gotta think you're the best woman
in the universe.

581
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:29,365
Don't exaggerate...

582
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,908
I swear to you...

583
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:33,702
If you don't think you're hot,
who's gonna think so?

584
00:32:33,702 --> 00:32:35,788
- That's true.
- Nobody, you know?

585
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:39,124
You're here. That's it.

586
00:32:40,209 --> 00:32:42,127
Fuck the rest.

587
00:32:52,805 --> 00:32:53,931
Excuse me...

588
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:55,933
Now it's our moment.

589
00:32:55,933 --> 00:32:58,352
We're walking.
We're gonna go out for a ride.

590
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:03,607
Let me ask you something...
Do you have a girlfriend?

591
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:05,609
Yes.

592
00:33:07,778 --> 00:33:09,154
Where do you live in Sampa?

593
00:33:09,154 --> 00:33:10,656
Vila Ipiranga, what about you?

594
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:12,616
I'm from Porto Alegre,

595
00:33:12,616 --> 00:33:14,660
but I've been to Sampa a lot...

596
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:17,621
I spent a lot of time
at Chácara Santo Antônio... A lot.

597
00:33:21,125 --> 00:33:22,209
Do you want him, girl?

598
00:33:22,418 --> 00:33:24,128
Do you wanna come to the box
where we're staying?

599
00:33:24,128 --> 00:33:25,462
I wanna go with you!

600
00:33:25,713 --> 00:33:26,880
- Let's go?
- Let's go.

601
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,549
I wanna go with you.

602
00:33:28,549 --> 00:33:30,217
- Follow me, then.
- I am.

603
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:32,428
Look at Blondie.

604
00:33:51,155 --> 00:33:53,282
Hey, mister...
Why do you have a girlfriend?

605
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:55,659
I'm dying to kiss you.

606
00:33:55,659 --> 00:33:57,286
- Really?
- I swear.

607
00:33:57,286 --> 00:33:58,370
I have a girlfriend...

608
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:00,706
I respect that.
Not even a little kiss?

609
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:04,251
I wanna kiss you pretty bad.

610
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:15,971
I can't believe it.

611
00:34:15,971 --> 00:34:17,431
That is brutal.

612
00:34:18,557 --> 00:34:19,683
They hired one for her...

613
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:21,935
They hired him.

614
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,063
They hired someone
to the one wearing lurex.

615
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:28,150
The good thing is that
they wear the same size.

616
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,991
Let me take off my earrings for you.

617
00:34:35,991 --> 00:34:38,619
No... What the...
Finish your meal, I'll pass.

618
00:34:38,619 --> 00:34:39,703
Okay.

619
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:48,420
Now I need to clean up.

620
00:34:48,962 --> 00:34:50,339
For Christ's sake!

621
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:54,051
- What is your name?
- Keila, and yours?

622
00:34:54,051 --> 00:34:55,886
- João, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet...

623
00:34:56,345 --> 00:34:58,222
- Are you from here?
- Porto Alegre.

624
00:34:58,222 --> 00:34:59,640
- Here.
- A fellow citizen.

625
00:34:59,932 --> 00:35:01,391
Everybody is going crazy.

626
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,400
Kiss him, kiss him, kiss him.

627
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,486
He's wonderful.
You're allowed to kiss him.

628
00:35:14,321 --> 00:35:15,531
Wow!

629
00:35:15,823 --> 00:35:18,242
- You're very hot, bro.
- Thank you.

630
00:35:28,585 --> 00:35:30,921
Let's go to the after party, then?

631
00:35:30,921 --> 00:35:32,089
Is it gonna be nice?

632
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:33,966
That's on us.

633
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:35,467
Because we are starving...

634
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:36,510
Let me tell you...

635
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:39,471
Is there a private room
for me and her to get some sleep?

636
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:41,723
You can sleep there...
It's okay.

637
00:35:42,266 --> 00:35:43,600
Let's go. Write down his number.

638
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,727
Make yourselves at home.
Let's go.

639
00:36:06,748 --> 00:36:08,834
Bia?

640
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:12,880
Show her my closet.
She wants some shorts, man.

641
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:15,173
Please.

642
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:17,759
- What is your name?
- Evelin.

643
00:36:18,051 --> 00:36:20,053
- Right. I remember.
- What about yours?

644
00:36:20,262 --> 00:36:21,638
- Beatriz.
- Right.

645
00:36:29,813 --> 00:36:31,815
We'll come to this room later...

646
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:34,484
It's the makeup room.

647
00:36:34,735 --> 00:36:36,069
Make-up room?

648
00:36:40,782 --> 00:36:41,867
Wow.

649
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,412
- What is this room?
- The Tiger Room.

650
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:48,373
This one is the Tiger Room...

651
00:36:55,172 --> 00:36:56,423
I find it very ugly...

652
00:36:56,423 --> 00:36:57,591
Jeez, man...

653
00:36:59,051 --> 00:37:00,886
- Did you get it?
- It looks like...

654
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:03,305
Oh, my God, it looks like...

655
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:05,432
Somebody who's never seen clothes...

656
00:37:05,432 --> 00:37:08,226
Somebody tell them
they're not gonna spend the night?

657
00:37:09,770 --> 00:37:11,271
Go to bed, girl... Leave them...

658
00:37:11,271 --> 00:37:13,231
Jesus, guys, cut it out.

659
00:37:18,111 --> 00:37:19,446
I wanna sleep here forever.

660
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:22,115
If you stay here with me,
you'd bring the whole house,

661
00:37:22,115 --> 00:37:23,492
and we're sleeping here every day.

662
00:37:23,492 --> 00:37:25,118
Every day.

663
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:29,998
I don't know...

664
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,294
It has begun.

665
00:37:34,753 --> 00:37:35,796
It has begun.

666
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:36,922
Is it cold?

667
00:37:37,839 --> 00:37:39,174
I found my flip-flops.

668
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:43,553
No kidding.

669
00:37:45,013 --> 00:37:46,223
Will you do me a favor?

670
00:37:46,682 --> 00:37:48,558
Can you take those flipflops off?

671
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:49,643
Sure, honey!

672
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,311
- Sure!
- You are wearing socks.

673
00:37:58,944 --> 00:38:00,028
Sure, honey.

674
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,405
Sure, baby.

675
00:38:01,405 --> 00:38:04,157
No. Will you eat this much, little one?

676
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:05,909
It looks like...

677
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:08,286
If she was phonier,
she'd be awarded a prize.

678
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:09,663
- What?
- You said that.

679
00:38:09,663 --> 00:38:11,540
- It was Maria.
- Phony what? I didn't get it.

680
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:12,874
I didn't say... I said...

681
00:38:12,874 --> 00:38:14,001
No, she was the one who said,

682
00:38:14,001 --> 00:38:15,460
"If she was phonier,
she'd be awarded a prize."

683
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,087
- Why did you say that?
- Because she said, "Bye..."

684
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,338
What did you say?

685
00:38:18,338 --> 00:38:20,132
It sounds phony when I'm called "honey".

686
00:38:25,178 --> 00:38:27,347
I think it sounds phony
when I'm called "honey."

687
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:30,475
It was a... A joke, got it?

688
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:31,560
It's better this way.

689
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,228
Easy, girls. Easy.

690
00:38:33,228 --> 00:38:34,604
This house is ours.

691
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:36,857
You're guests, okay?

692
00:38:37,190 --> 00:38:38,525
First of all, be polite.

693
00:38:38,525 --> 00:38:39,693
Guys, relax.

694
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:42,821
Man, we're at the table, please.

695
00:38:42,821 --> 00:38:44,364
That's why I was joking, got it?
Peacefully.

696
00:38:44,364 --> 00:38:47,034
She's mine, too.
So, a little more respect, please.

697
00:38:47,701 --> 00:38:49,161
Easy, easy, easy...

698
00:38:51,371 --> 00:38:53,373
Let's eat, okay. The food is delicious!

699
00:38:53,373 --> 00:38:55,876
I don't think she meant to call you...
Got it?

700
00:38:55,876 --> 00:38:57,461
No, I was saying to Maria that...

701
00:38:57,461 --> 00:38:59,254
I think it's phony
when somebody calls me "honey."

702
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:01,089
No, it's over.

703
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:02,966
I said specifically to her.

704
00:39:02,966 --> 00:39:04,092
No, it's over.

705
00:39:12,976 --> 00:39:14,603
There is a lot of screaming upstairs.

706
00:39:15,228 --> 00:39:17,564
It's hard, thank God, Lord.

707
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:20,442
He is relieved.
It's been a week, he was in need.

708
00:39:20,776 --> 00:39:22,152
The boy earned it.

709
00:39:22,319 --> 00:39:24,362
He came back
from Amazonas and came straight here.

710
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,364
And back in Amazonas, he did nothing.

711
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,366
He was there for a month.

712
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,328
Shit, there are wild women in Amazonas.

713
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:33,622
Put some clothes on.

714
00:39:33,622 --> 00:39:35,665
You were the one who took them off.

715
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:36,958
Roll up.

716
00:39:36,958 --> 00:39:39,377
Will you do me a favor? Here, this way?

717
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:41,254
Stop it, let me see if it worked.

718
00:39:42,214 --> 00:39:43,131
Let me see.

719
00:39:43,131 --> 00:39:44,925
Yes!

720
00:39:56,103 --> 00:39:57,312
Hey, Ramon, come here.

721
00:39:58,105 --> 00:39:59,356
Come here.

722
00:39:59,815 --> 00:40:01,024
Let's talk, now.

723
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:02,943
Girls are teasing your girls...

724
00:40:02,943 --> 00:40:04,945
I'm gonna send the girls away, man.

725
00:40:04,945 --> 00:40:05,946
I'm gonna send them away.

726
00:40:05,946 --> 00:40:09,282
I'm gonna do it, do you know why?
I don't want trouble, you know?

727
00:40:09,282 --> 00:40:11,409
Girls from here
are talking shit about them.

728
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:12,494
What did you tell them?

729
00:40:12,494 --> 00:40:14,412
- Go fuck yourself. That's it.
- What?

730
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,498
- Bro, way too lame.
- Look...

731
00:40:16,498 --> 00:40:18,750
Here's what I think...
If we hook up with someone...

732
00:40:19,126 --> 00:40:21,670
Your girl is gonna stay,
but the other two are leaving.

733
00:40:21,670 --> 00:40:22,921
I made a mistake...

734
00:40:24,214 --> 00:40:25,674
I wouldn't do it if I were you.

735
00:40:25,966 --> 00:40:27,259
I'm gonna do it. Do you know why?

736
00:40:27,259 --> 00:40:30,053
I can't take it. Or I'm gonna say
"fuck you" to somebody.

737
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:31,680
I almost said it to Nath.

738
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:33,640
I don't wanna stop being friends
with anyone.

739
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:38,395
Let me talk to you, guys.

740
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:39,604
Where's the milk, honey?

741
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,485
Bro, here's the thing.

742
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:47,320
You know the girls are not agreeing...

743
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:48,405
Really?

744
00:40:48,822 --> 00:40:51,408
We're gonna call a cab for you guys
because we...

745
00:40:51,408 --> 00:40:56,872
I don't want trouble, I don't wanna tell
the girls to fuck off, you know?

746
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:04,421
I'm really leaving,
or else I'm gonna kick somebody's ass.

747
00:41:04,421 --> 00:41:05,589
Did you have enough?

748
00:41:15,807 --> 00:41:18,101
Fucking slut, I'm pissed.

749
00:41:18,393 --> 00:41:19,394
Ramon?

750
00:41:19,895 --> 00:41:21,479
- He's naked.
- You're a sensible person...

751
00:41:21,479 --> 00:41:23,273
He didn't see this demon.

752
00:41:23,273 --> 00:41:24,566
Don't come in here.

753
00:41:24,566 --> 00:41:26,151
I'm not going there,
I'm gonna stay here.

754
00:41:26,526 --> 00:41:28,069
You're a sensible person...

755
00:41:28,069 --> 00:41:30,655
- Talk to me.
- She's cheeky?

756
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,657
Not Murilo's girl, the other one.

757
00:41:32,908 --> 00:41:34,659
The other one is quiet.

758
00:41:35,035 --> 00:41:38,747
Murilo's girl is quiet.
Now, the other one...

759
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:40,081
Too cheeky, that Shakira girl.

760
00:41:40,081 --> 00:41:42,083
I swear to God, she threw them and said,

761
00:41:42,083 --> 00:41:44,669
"Take it, honey."
Those flip-flops are mine.

762
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:48,256
- It's complicated.
- Jeez...

763
00:41:48,256 --> 00:41:50,008
"'Honey' sounds phony to me."

764
00:41:50,008 --> 00:41:51,509
She said that out of the blue!

765
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:02,187
Bye. Good night. God bless you.

766
00:42:05,065 --> 00:42:06,650
Sorry about everything.

767
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:07,776
No problem.

768
00:42:07,943 --> 00:42:09,611
- See you tomorrow, right?
- See you.

769
00:42:09,611 --> 00:42:10,904
Let's stay in touch.

770
00:42:22,499 --> 00:42:24,584
Bro, that's something. Here's the thing.

771
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,087
The chick made a joke with her friend...

772
00:42:27,087 --> 00:42:29,464
Why? Because she wanted to tease her, bro.

773
00:42:29,464 --> 00:42:31,549
Or else,
she wouldn't have said anything.

774
00:42:31,549 --> 00:42:33,510
If that happened to anyone else...

775
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,095
- You're losers.
- No, I'm not.

776
00:42:35,095 --> 00:42:37,055
No, I didn't talk about you. Not you.

777
00:42:37,055 --> 00:42:38,431
Are you talking about me?

778
00:42:38,431 --> 00:42:39,641
This is not about you.

779
00:42:39,641 --> 00:42:43,353
Nevertheless, I didn't like it.

780
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:44,604
You gotta respect above all.

781
00:42:44,604 --> 00:42:46,481
Do you think they respected us?

782
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:47,816
What did they do? Tell me.

783
00:42:47,816 --> 00:42:50,026
They're our guests.
The house is ours, not theirs.

784
00:42:50,026 --> 00:42:51,236
Tell me. What did they do?

785
00:42:51,236 --> 00:42:53,238
What did they do?

786
00:42:53,238 --> 00:42:55,198
Called us losers.

787
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:56,574
Said, "That's disgusting."

788
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,243
She was talking to her friend.

789
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:01,371
End of discussion.
There's nobody here anymore.

790
00:43:01,371 --> 00:43:04,666
I don't even know their names,
because nobody said, "Hi, I am..."

791
00:43:04,666 --> 00:43:06,293
End of discussion. It's cool.

792
00:43:06,293 --> 00:43:09,671
Man, now that they bounced,
let's talk about...

793
00:43:09,671 --> 00:43:10,880
I don't wanna talk...

794
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:12,716
What am I gonna say?

795
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:21,141
Wait, guys, let's give it up for João,
come on.

796
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:23,893
I'd only believe it
if the comforter was removed.

797
00:43:23,893 --> 00:43:25,312
- My God!
- João had sex.

798
00:43:25,312 --> 00:43:27,063
I wanted to be that girl!

799
00:43:27,063 --> 00:43:30,108
He left the room celebrating
in front of her, man.

800
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:33,445
That's fucked up!

801
00:43:33,445 --> 00:43:34,904
Guys, I had sex, look!

802
00:43:34,904 --> 00:43:37,615
Yeah! That's a dickhead, bro, really.

803
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:39,034
Would you ask for the flip-flops back?

804
00:43:39,034 --> 00:43:41,661
- I wouldn't!
- I'd say, "Bitch, come here."

805
00:43:41,661 --> 00:43:43,955
I'd tell her,
"He's just hooking up with you,

806
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:45,373
"because he loves me."

807
00:43:45,749 --> 00:43:46,875
Would you tell her that?

808
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:48,793
...that would be
lowering myself to their level.

809
00:43:48,793 --> 00:43:52,297
That would mean I care about him.

810
00:43:52,297 --> 00:43:53,715
Mariano, what would you do?

811
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:55,467
Man, I would bounce.

812
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:56,634
Would you give her your flip-flops?

813
00:43:56,634 --> 00:43:59,012
If you were Taynara, you'd say,
"Keep my flip-flops?"

814
00:43:59,012 --> 00:44:01,848
But I'd say to her, "Look, sis,
let's stay together

815
00:44:01,848 --> 00:44:04,267
"because he's messing you guys..."

816
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:06,436
"He's bringing you down here,
because we had a fight.

817
00:44:06,436 --> 00:44:10,190
"What do we do now? Let's be a team
and leave him jerking off."

818
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:11,733
Leave him alone.

819
00:44:11,733 --> 00:44:12,901
This should happen.

820
00:44:12,901 --> 00:44:16,279
If men did something like that,
it'd be a mess.

821
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:19,699
Those chicks faced the other ones
because they worked as a team.

822
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:22,535
They made him jealous.
Usually women are like... "Fuck it."

823
00:44:22,535 --> 00:44:23,828
I love it. Women are like that.

824
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:26,081
"Yo, are you hooking up
with my friend's boy?

825
00:44:26,081 --> 00:44:27,999
"She's hurt because of that..."

826
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:29,250
This situation was too awkward.

827
00:44:29,793 --> 00:44:31,836
This is friendship.

828
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:34,130
I can talk shit about my friend,
but nobody else can.

829
00:44:34,506 --> 00:44:38,385
When you get emotional, you get stupid
and you don't rationalize

830
00:44:38,385 --> 00:44:39,844
like we're doing here.

831
00:44:40,095 --> 00:44:44,391
When you're angry, you don't behave
like when you are here watching the TV.

832
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:47,685
But, at least, I won the bet,
because João had sex.

833
00:44:47,936 --> 00:44:49,229
João had sex!

834
00:44:49,229 --> 00:44:50,230
Way to go, João!

835
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:51,606
Do you remember who bet...

836
00:44:51,606 --> 00:44:53,733
I don't. I bet he wouldn't,
I lost the bet.

837
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:55,735
I know, you have to
pay me forfeit, Pabllo.

838
00:44:55,735 --> 00:44:57,237
- What forfeit?
- Come here.

839
00:44:57,237 --> 00:44:58,321
What?

840
00:44:59,239 --> 00:45:00,281
She said, "What?"

841
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:02,033
Because I was here, look!

842
00:45:02,033 --> 00:45:03,410
- Forget it...
- What?

843
00:45:03,535 --> 00:45:07,038
Let me say it,
I think João is gonna date that girl.

844
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:08,706
- No way, girl.
- He is.

845
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:11,209
She already noticed she was his first...

846
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:12,919
She was the first girl he hooked up with.

847
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:14,671
And she's gonna take off.

848
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:16,923
I think João is gonna show
who he really is from now on.

849
00:45:16,923 --> 00:45:20,135
Now that he's made a start,
he's gonna begin, I think...

850
00:45:20,135 --> 00:45:21,511
No way. I know his type.

851
00:45:21,845 --> 00:45:23,138
Okay, then. You'll see.

852
00:45:23,513 --> 00:45:25,098
I'm going by what he said. He said,

853
00:45:25,098 --> 00:45:28,935
-"I'm not a fucker, I'm a kisser." So...
- I'm a kisser.

854
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:30,311
ON THE NEXT EPISODE

855
00:45:30,311 --> 00:45:31,438
Look at this beautiful place.

856
00:45:34,107 --> 00:45:36,860
- Why are you looking at her like this?
- Come on...

857
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:46,786
Ramon and Luan are not getting along, boy.

858
00:45:46,786 --> 00:45:49,622
That sign in the background is the best:
"Keep going."

859
00:45:50,039 --> 00:45:52,041
- João is in the middle of it.
- Keep going.

860
00:45:52,041 --> 00:45:53,334
What do you think
they're fighting about?

861
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:56,171
Because of those women there,
or is it a problem they have?

862
00:45:56,171 --> 00:46:00,008
I think... Luan is very close to Tay,
he wants to protect her.

863
00:46:00,467 --> 00:46:01,801
Murilo is mad at this and...

864
00:46:01,801 --> 00:46:05,054
No, I think Murilo messed up,
and he's protecting a friend.

865
00:46:05,054 --> 00:46:07,223
But Murilo is not arguing,
it's Ramon.

866
00:46:07,223 --> 00:46:09,476
- Ramon and...
- And Luan. I didn't get it.

867
00:46:09,476 --> 00:46:11,269
Is it because of women?

868
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:12,604
It's the liquor talking.

869
00:46:12,604 --> 00:46:14,230
...with the other's girl?

870
00:46:14,230 --> 00:46:15,398
It's because of booze.

871
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:17,150
Booze. There's no girl...

872
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:19,235
- I think it's because of food.
- Food?

873
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:21,404
I don't know, I'm hungry.
It's already noon. Titto...

874
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:24,407
Booze

875
00:46:24,407 --> 00:46:26,409
That's gotta be booze...
And women, bro.

876
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:28,369
Men only fight because of those things.

877
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:29,829
Booze

878
00:46:29,829 --> 00:46:32,540
Men also fight over cars...
You hit my car, yo.

879
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:33,791
...spent more money at some party.

880
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:34,834
I don't know.

881
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:36,503
There could be several reasons.

882
00:46:36,503 --> 00:46:40,215
I know I'm not gonna be able to sleep
till next week, I wanna watch this now.

883
00:46:40,215 --> 00:46:41,633
I'm anxious.

884
00:46:41,633 --> 00:46:44,552
I'm very anxious about
the next episode. Bia, are you anxious?

885
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:45,887
I think they're gonna get married.

886
00:46:45,887 --> 00:46:47,305
I think Tay is gonna marry Murilo.

887
00:46:47,305 --> 00:46:50,558
Whose house is gonna be the next episode?

888
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:52,018
We're interested in trouble.

889
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:53,561
It's gonna be here, in your house.

890
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:54,771
Do you like a fight?

891
00:46:54,771 --> 00:46:55,772
I love it.

892
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:58,358
Are you anxious, Carol?

893
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:02,820
I love a fight. I love when the fight
is about to happen. I love it, man.

894
00:47:03,488 --> 00:47:06,866
Bro, did you eat six sticks at once?
Man, were you starving?

895
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:07,909
It's delicious.

896
00:47:07,909 --> 00:47:09,536
Damn! Where were you locked up?
