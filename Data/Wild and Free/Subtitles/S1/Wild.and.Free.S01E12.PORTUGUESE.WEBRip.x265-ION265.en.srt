WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS
REVIEW

2
00:00:19,603 --> 00:00:22,314
Hello, people. How are you? Look...

3
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:27,403
We're here together to watch episode six
of Wild and Free: Florianópolis.

4
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:29,572
Remember that on the previous episode

5
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:35,286
ended with Nathalia
catching Ramon red-handed.

6
00:00:35,286 --> 00:00:40,124
"Catching him red-handed?"
That was a good one. Great.

7
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:42,126
What? Did you know about this?

8
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:46,338
To catch red-handed is a soap opera
back in Cuiabá, got it?

9
00:00:46,338 --> 00:00:48,257
- So, let's watch it?
- Let's do it.

10
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:50,718
Take the remote and press play.
Bye, thanks.

11
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:52,595
With your heels.

12
00:00:52,595 --> 00:00:54,388
With your clog heels.

13
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:55,848
Let's do it.

14
00:00:55,848 --> 00:00:57,641
Get out of here. You're sassy...

15
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:08,194
No, it's not.

16
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:12,281
Guys, let me talk...
Did you see Ramon's little smile?

17
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:14,784
I think he's doing it on purpose now,

18
00:01:14,784 --> 00:01:16,952
hooking up with another girl.
Look how she left.

19
00:01:16,952 --> 00:01:18,412
She was very cold...

20
00:01:18,412 --> 00:01:22,583
- She grimaced. Look at her disgusted face.
- But he didn't see it. He didn't care.

21
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:25,211
- He smiled at the friend.
- She also grimaced.

22
00:01:25,211 --> 00:01:27,379
It was because of that girl.

23
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:30,841
- But he's enjoying she got pissed.
- She's being fussy.

24
00:01:30,841 --> 00:01:34,595
I think it was for the girl,
after the situation Nathalia caused.

25
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:36,806
The girl must be embarrassed.

26
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:39,099
- The girl must be...
- But he's cute, right?

27
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:41,727
- He's cute.
- She's very embarrassed.

28
00:01:41,852 --> 00:01:43,020
- Who? Ramon?
- Yeah...

29
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:44,814
But she's beautiful, too, right?

30
00:01:44,814 --> 00:01:46,524
Hit pause, Bianca.

31
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:50,694
- Let's see what's inside this box.
- Open it.

32
00:01:50,694 --> 00:01:51,612
CRUSH PARTY

33
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,489
- It's the party thing.
- That's rad.

34
00:01:53,489 --> 00:01:55,241
Look at this flyer.

35
00:01:55,241 --> 00:01:56,450
That's why...

36
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:57,785
It's the manager's party.

37
00:01:57,785 --> 00:01:59,078
They have to promote.

38
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:00,621
Crush party.

39
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:04,959
I wonder if I could ask my brother
to show up at this party.

40
00:02:04,959 --> 00:02:06,043
I don't know.

41
00:02:06,043 --> 00:02:09,171
Dear Lord.
Imagine if his brother is like him? Hot...

42
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:12,132
If his brother is a fucker like him...

43
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:14,510
- He's a fucker, that's real.
- Who? Johnny?

44
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:15,636
- João.
- João.

45
00:02:15,636 --> 00:02:18,389
Pretended to be humble, said,
"I'm a kisser, not a fucker."

46
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:20,349
In two days,
he fucked more than anyone.

47
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,145
- Hello?
- What's up, Tô? What's up, man?

48
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:26,230
Thor?

49
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:31,986
They talk like...

50
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:33,612
It's like Scary Movie.

51
00:02:33,612 --> 00:02:35,072
Wassup!

52
00:02:36,198 --> 00:02:37,449
Scream, right?

53
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:38,742
Is it cool? Really?

54
00:02:38,742 --> 00:02:42,037
It's hard to explain.
It's crazy here, man...

55
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:46,834
I'm shaking, talking to you, man.
I even farted.

56
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,460
Really?

57
00:02:48,919 --> 00:02:51,005
- What did he say?
-"I even farted."

58
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:54,842
Talk to me about everything,
but don't talk about fart and poop.

59
00:02:54,842 --> 00:02:56,343
- Yeah.
- It's such a turn-off.

60
00:02:56,343 --> 00:02:58,262
It's not a turn-off,
it's out of line.

61
00:02:58,262 --> 00:03:00,598
It's too much intimacy
and it ruins relationships.

62
00:03:00,598 --> 00:03:01,932
That's my tip to you.

63
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,726
Don't shit in front of your women.

64
00:03:03,726 --> 00:03:06,645
If the boy farts on your face,
what do you do?

65
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:07,771
- What?
- On my face?

66
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:09,481
It's a metaphor. I mean, in front of you.

67
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:11,859
- When I'm lying down?
- He's with you.

68
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:14,945
- Lying down, standing, doing a handstand.
- I say, "Get up."

69
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:19,241
- It pisses me off, fuck.
- Of course.

70
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:27,750
Bro, that's the tiff bus.

71
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,835
Everything starts there.

72
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:31,587
Yeah... It's called devil bus.

73
00:03:51,023 --> 00:03:53,150
- Luan is seated.
- Look at Luan's face.

74
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,318
Beatriz over there...

75
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:57,571
- His woman is calling...
- I get it. Look.

76
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,281
What is that? Is he jealous?

77
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:00,366
Obviously!

78
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:04,203
Poor guy. She's not allowed to dance...

79
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,206
Look at that uncomfortable face.

80
00:04:07,206 --> 00:04:09,416
He looks like he wants to fight.

81
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,211
He looks like he's not confident.
He has a small dick.

82
00:04:12,211 --> 00:04:13,837
His woman dances and he gets sad.

83
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,682
Guys, she's dancing in front of a girl.

84
00:04:27,226 --> 00:04:29,645
- João is kissing.
- João, the kisser.

85
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:31,689
Oh, no, bro!

86
00:04:31,689 --> 00:04:34,358
Guys, come on. She didn't do anything.

87
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:35,776
She was just dancing.

88
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:37,611
She was dancing like this with her friend.

89
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,905
She was like this... Right, Carol?

90
00:04:39,905 --> 00:04:43,075
Then he said,
"I didn't like the way you were dancing."

91
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:45,035
She said, "I didn't do anything."

92
00:04:45,035 --> 00:04:46,495
With her friend.

93
00:04:46,495 --> 00:04:52,251
- Yeah, but I think Murilo was there, too.
- No, he wasn't.

94
00:04:53,043 --> 00:04:54,545
Murilo was there, mister.

95
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,547
Guys, Murilo was just passing by.

96
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:59,591
Has anyone here had a date
who didn't allow it?

97
00:04:59,591 --> 00:05:02,720
No, but I've seen
someone doing this to a friend of mine.

98
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,346
I've seen it, it makes me mad

99
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:07,266
because I've seen girls get scared
and change, you know?

100
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:09,226
It's called possession.

101
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,186
That's why I'm single.

102
00:05:11,186 --> 00:05:14,356
If my girl dances with another man,
I don't even...

103
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,108
She wouldn't be my girl.

104
00:05:16,108 --> 00:05:18,444
If I had to tell her this,
she wouldn't be my girl.

105
00:05:18,444 --> 00:05:19,528
So, you're jealous.

106
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:22,698
She has to know
she can't rub her ass against another guy.

107
00:05:22,698 --> 00:05:23,782
So, you're jealous.

108
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,868
It's not jealousy, man. It's respect.

109
00:05:25,868 --> 00:05:29,496
If I do that with another girl,
my girl would say,

110
00:05:29,496 --> 00:05:30,956
-"Holy fuck."
- But if it was her?

111
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:32,791
She doesn't need to tell me this.

112
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,169
Dancing with her girlfriend...

113
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,378
I'm going to say...

114
00:05:36,378 --> 00:05:37,463
- With her girlfriend?
- Yeah.

115
00:05:37,463 --> 00:05:39,590
She knows what she can do, got it?

116
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,633
She's only my woman because of that.

117
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:46,847
Bê is dancing on the counter,
and he's after Bê.

118
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,432
What's the deal with Murilo?

119
00:05:48,432 --> 00:05:50,809
No. I think Murilo
has no ulterior motives.

120
00:05:50,809 --> 00:05:52,394
No, of course...

121
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:54,563
When the person is not right

122
00:05:54,563 --> 00:05:56,648
or they make something up...

123
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:58,650
Yeah... There's no more reason.

124
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,903
But there's another thing.

125
00:06:00,903 --> 00:06:02,321
He can hook up with everyone,

126
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:05,032
like he did with that girl
from that club because of João,

127
00:06:05,032 --> 00:06:08,202
and she can't dance because
he's assuming she's going to do...

128
00:06:08,202 --> 00:06:10,621
- Exactly. He doesn't trust her.
- That's crazy.

129
00:06:10,621 --> 00:06:12,706
- That's insecurity.
- This is something...

130
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:14,958
Yeah, and Bia killed it. She was there.

131
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:17,419
That guy came,
and she said, "No, no, wait."

132
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,129
This is because
the guy has a small penis.

133
00:06:19,254 --> 00:06:20,255
Bia nailed it.

134
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,634
Bia said, "No, it's not going
to happen now, respect me."

135
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:26,720
And he did what you said, Titto.
There's no reason...

136
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,223
Says bullshit and walks away.
That's ungraceful.

137
00:06:29,223 --> 00:06:30,390
He made a mistake.

138
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,979
It's over... Let's go.

139
00:06:40,109 --> 00:06:41,527
Let's go.

140
00:06:44,947 --> 00:06:47,366
- Fuck, Murilo is wasted.
- Everyone is hammered.

141
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:50,077
What did you call it?
"He flopped the party," right?

142
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:53,080
- He asked everyone to leave.
- Look at Murilo.

143
00:06:58,669 --> 00:07:01,588
We ruled, baby.

144
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:05,134
This one wanted things to get ugly...

145
00:07:06,135 --> 00:07:08,679
Fuck him. Fuck him.

146
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:12,099
That's who you are, Beatriz. This is you.
What did I say to you?

147
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:15,769
- Baby, shut up, you know shit about me.
- Be free.

148
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,729
- This is you.
- That's right.

149
00:07:17,729 --> 00:07:19,648
Don't pretend to be a good person.

150
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:22,276
Jeez, he's being loud.
There's no reason...

151
00:07:22,276 --> 00:07:24,027
- This is me.
- Fuck you!

152
00:07:24,027 --> 00:07:25,487
You, go fuck yourself.

153
00:07:25,487 --> 00:07:28,240
Jeez, what an asshole, bro.

154
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,825
He has flopped big time.

155
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:31,618
- Man, what?
- Man, we danced a lot.

156
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,537
Man, what?

157
00:07:34,204 --> 00:07:35,289
Man, what?

158
00:07:35,289 --> 00:07:37,124
I danced a lot with Bia. Fuck it.

159
00:07:37,124 --> 00:07:40,711
I saw it. What if it was me with Tay?

160
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,797
Now, you're upset, right?

161
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:46,758
Bro, you do whatever you want,
right, Luan?

162
00:07:46,758 --> 00:07:50,179
Respect me, boy. Know your place, boy.

163
00:07:50,304 --> 00:07:52,598
- I know my place.
- Get your hands off me.

164
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:55,309
"Get your hands off me." What a hero.

165
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:56,977
I danced with Bia.

166
00:07:56,977 --> 00:08:00,272
Like I danced with Tay,
like I danced with Blondie.

167
00:08:00,272 --> 00:08:02,107
There's no reason to fight.

168
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:04,484
- Do you wanna fight?
- What do you want?

169
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,028
I'm not going to ignore this!

170
00:08:06,028 --> 00:08:07,613
I want to fight you!

171
00:08:08,447 --> 00:08:09,698
Oh, my God.

172
00:08:10,532 --> 00:08:14,244
Taynara showed up.
I love when she defends her boy.

173
00:08:14,244 --> 00:08:17,289
- Murilo...
- Are you fucking with me?

174
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:23,128
I'm going to tell you something.
I always respected you.

175
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:26,131
- Me, too. So what?
- Look, I'm going to tell you something.

176
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:28,342
I never treated you like this, you know?

177
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:31,386
- Easy...
- Stop it, man... Please, bro.

178
00:08:31,803 --> 00:08:34,973
If there's one thing I understand
is a situation like this.

179
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:36,934
Because I used to pick fights.

180
00:08:36,934 --> 00:08:38,477
I'm a better person now.

181
00:08:38,477 --> 00:08:40,687
- That guy is a coward.
- It's obvious.

182
00:08:40,812 --> 00:08:42,356
He said a lot of things,

183
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:45,234
repeated the same sentence
because he's desperate, like,

184
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:47,236
"Are you fucking with me?"

185
00:08:47,236 --> 00:08:50,239
The guy is very close.
If you want to hit him, just do it.

186
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:52,532
He's a coward, he won't do anything.

187
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:53,617
Yeah. Exactly.

188
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,494
He only incites a fight.

189
00:08:55,494 --> 00:08:57,454
When things get ugly,
he doesn't do anything.

190
00:08:57,579 --> 00:08:59,748
He's an asshole who wants to show off.

191
00:08:59,748 --> 00:09:02,251
There could be 50 guys, if you want
to hit someone, you will do it.

192
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:03,210
There's no talk.

193
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,337
- Do you think you're a man?
- Easy.

194
00:09:06,255 --> 00:09:07,256
Who do you think you are?

195
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:08,382
They're going to kill him.

196
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,967
Easy, Murilo.

197
00:09:09,967 --> 00:09:11,885
I respected your girl a lot.

198
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:16,723
Because yesterday when you were wasted,
I took care of her, you fucker.

199
00:09:16,723 --> 00:09:18,517
That's because I care about you.

200
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:21,019
-"Fucker..."
- He's full of reason, look.

201
00:09:21,019 --> 00:09:22,104
Easy, Murilo.

202
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:23,897
Fuck, I love Murilo.

203
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:28,527
- That Luan is a...
- He's wrong.

204
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:29,945
I would be like Tay.

205
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:33,573
I would come at someone who's
attacking the person you love.

206
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:37,160
If someone attacks who I love, I go crazy.

207
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,161
It's about the other person.

208
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,747
Especially when you're right.

209
00:09:40,747 --> 00:09:43,166
...but if I have to defend who I love,
I go crazy.

210
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:46,962
At any time, she didn't question whether
her man danced with another woman.

211
00:09:46,962 --> 00:09:48,755
- At any moment.
- She didn't even bother.

212
00:09:48,755 --> 00:09:50,299
She was confident and said,

213
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:53,719
"You can dance. You're my man,
but you can dance with my girlfriends."

214
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:56,221
She was in the dark, she had no fear.

215
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:58,932
The most controversial couple
in the beginning of the episode.

216
00:09:58,932 --> 00:10:01,268
Yeah, there was more trouble.

217
00:10:01,268 --> 00:10:03,770
Would you break up that fight
or would you cheer?

218
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:04,771
I hate fights.

219
00:10:04,771 --> 00:10:08,442
Girl, obviously, I would shout,
"Fight, fight!" I'm joking...

220
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:10,277
You need to be in a good mood.

221
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:11,820
I think I would be Taynara.

222
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,864
I would shout, "Stick together!"

223
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:16,950
I think Murilo said beautiful things.

224
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,661
- He was very reasonable.
- I'm a cool person.

225
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:22,205
When I want to have sex, I have sex.

226
00:10:22,205 --> 00:10:24,499
I don't need to date.

227
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:27,127
He's not ready to have
a good woman beside him.

228
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:31,882
He has to hook up with someone worse than
her 'cause he can't handle that woman...

229
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:35,719
He's not willing to be with her,
no guts to be with that kind of woman.

230
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:38,472
It's over. He's not ready, brother.

231
00:10:38,472 --> 00:10:42,434
Go seek a worse woman
'cause she's out of your league...

232
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:43,685
She's too much for you.

233
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:46,646
Do you think he's going to
apologize the next day?

234
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,566
Obviously. He always does that.

235
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:52,027
- He always does that.
- He doesn't apologize.

236
00:10:52,027 --> 00:10:53,695
Ramon's turn, Ramon went there.

237
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,864
He thinks he forgives people. He says,

238
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:59,117
"No, you were wrong,
but you're going to be a better person."

239
00:10:59,117 --> 00:11:01,328
He thinks he's the man. He's God's voice.

240
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,914
I think Bia is not going back to him.

241
00:11:03,914 --> 00:11:05,082
Girl...

242
00:11:05,082 --> 00:11:06,958
And João was absolute.

243
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:09,127
"I'm going to have to make you pass out."

244
00:11:09,127 --> 00:11:11,296
- I wonder if he did.
- João's funny.

245
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:14,841
He applied a rear naked choke hold.
He just had to choke, and he'd pass out.

246
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:18,220
João is that famous person who doesn't
want trouble.

247
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,264
He didn't get involved with those girls.

248
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:24,935
He'll make that guy pass out,
but he'll caress him.

249
00:11:24,935 --> 00:11:27,521
I want to know the mood in that house now.

250
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:30,899
- I wonder if they're going to have sex.
- Of course not.

251
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:34,069
- There's no mood for sex.
- Look at him pretending to be tough.

252
00:11:34,069 --> 00:11:35,529
João is great. He's great.

253
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,114
He's a coward.

254
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:38,615
Inflated pecs.

255
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:06,685
I want to see him now, when he wakes up.
Sitting at that table, looking like shit.

256
00:12:06,685 --> 00:12:09,980
- That's going to be bad.
- Breakfast gets hard to swallow, girl.

257
00:12:10,814 --> 00:12:12,858
Look at João, he doesn't know anything.

258
00:12:12,858 --> 00:12:15,068
Poor thing, he's full of bruises.

259
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,696
- Poor thing was hit a lot.
- No, he wasn't hit.

260
00:12:17,696 --> 00:12:19,030
Luan...

261
00:12:20,615 --> 00:12:22,659
What are you doing to yourself, man?

262
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:25,537
Beatriz did it... She did it...

263
00:12:25,537 --> 00:12:29,249
But I don't think like that.
In my opinion...

264
00:12:29,249 --> 00:12:33,545
Murilo wanted to talk to you respectfully.

265
00:12:33,545 --> 00:12:35,839
Even I danced with Murilo.

266
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:37,924
I hug Murilo,
and there's nothing going on.

267
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:39,342
He never disrespected me.

268
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:41,511
Just saying that you are wrong.

269
00:12:41,511 --> 00:12:43,346
But I won't leave you alone.

270
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,182
- It's cool.
- That's it.

271
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:46,266
Thanks.

272
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,184
Guys.

273
00:12:47,184 --> 00:12:49,769
- It looks like a soap opera.
- But she's sensible.

274
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:51,688
She's already changed the episode.

275
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,231
She can't deal with her relationship.

276
00:12:53,231 --> 00:12:54,566
But she can do it with her friends.

277
00:12:54,566 --> 00:12:56,109
She's supportive
because he defended her.

278
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:57,444
Yeah, exactly.

279
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:02,365
I wanted to explain what I thought, okay?

280
00:13:02,365 --> 00:13:05,911
I know I'm wrong, okay? I apologize
before starting this conversation.

281
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:07,120
No problem...

282
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:11,124
I'm a little aggressive. People know me.
I got really jealous of Bia.

283
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,835
When I came back from the smoking lounge,

284
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:16,129
Bia and Nath were dancing
with you behind them.

285
00:13:16,129 --> 00:13:18,673
For me that's very serious, you know?

286
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:21,635
But I'm truly sorry, bro.
I didn't even sleep, you know?

287
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:25,722
He's apologizing for the assault,
but not because he was an asshole.

288
00:13:25,722 --> 00:13:28,099
He's just admitting he's jealous.

289
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:30,435
He's admitting he was wrong.
Let him admit it.

290
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,854
It's like, "You got me, right?"

291
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:35,065
No, he's just saying he's a jealous guy.

292
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:37,400
And he has no control.
He's just saying this.

293
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:40,862
Let's hear him out.
Don't be so judgmental, Judge.

294
00:13:40,862 --> 00:13:42,864
- I'm here to judge.
- Judge Drops.

295
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:47,035
I know I can trust few people here,
and you're one of them.

296
00:13:47,035 --> 00:13:48,745
I should've never suspected you

297
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:51,623
and involved you
in that unpleasant situation. Really.

298
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,166
Relax. We're good.

299
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,252
I apologize from the bottom of my heart.

300
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,380
- Look!
- I don't know...

301
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:01,841
He admitted he was wrong.

302
00:14:01,841 --> 00:14:03,593
But he has to talk to Beatriz.

303
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,512
Yes, he has to do it now, right?

304
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:12,602
Bê... Can you go to the Tiger Room
so that we can talk? Five minutes.

305
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:15,105
I'm just going to shower. Just a second.

306
00:14:15,105 --> 00:14:16,189
Okay.

307
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:22,821
Let's change this attitude, right?
Holy shit.

308
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:25,615
I still want to hook up with him.

309
00:14:25,615 --> 00:14:28,577
He's going to apologize,
but he's going to break up.

310
00:14:28,577 --> 00:14:30,287
"You're not the kind of woman..."

311
00:14:30,287 --> 00:14:31,329
I don't think so.

312
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:32,581
I think he's gonna do this.

313
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:36,418
Or, since he called her to that room,
he's going to resolve that with sex.

314
00:14:36,418 --> 00:14:39,296
- She's going to break up with him.
- That's my dream.

315
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:41,381
- It's cold in here.
- The way I like it.

316
00:14:41,381 --> 00:14:43,300
Is he really going
to resolve this with sex?

317
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,968
Can I give you a hug first?

318
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:47,012
- No...
- Hey, guys, it's back.

319
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:49,931
Look, it's back.

320
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:51,516
Baby, they hugged, it's gone.

321
00:14:51,516 --> 00:14:53,268
They're going to have sex.

322
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:59,441
I talked to Murilo... I'm here to
apologize to you for the things I said.

323
00:14:59,441 --> 00:15:02,986
You're a very important woman to me.

324
00:15:02,986 --> 00:15:05,739
You became very important
in a very short time.

325
00:15:05,739 --> 00:15:08,199
I know I want you in my life forever.

326
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:09,576
No matter what.

327
00:15:10,035 --> 00:15:14,164
- I understand your motives...
- Do you want to know the truth?

328
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:17,834
- What?
- The truth is that I love you.

329
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,337
What? Does he want to be her boyfriend?

330
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:22,047
"I love you."

331
00:15:22,047 --> 00:15:23,506
Did he say, "I love you"?

332
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,592
"Do you want to know the truth?"

333
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:27,844
I just need this.

334
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:29,596
Bullshit.

335
00:15:29,596 --> 00:15:32,766
That dude fucks things up,
the next day, he...

336
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,351
He even says "I love you..."

337
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:39,397
If Bia buys that...

338
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:41,566
...you realized what you had to

339
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:44,569
and apologized, you know?

340
00:15:44,569 --> 00:15:48,782
You were humble to see
that nobody is perfect...

341
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:51,159
- Can you hug me again?
- Yes.

342
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:54,204
The guy is exaggerating.

343
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:56,414
- I believe him.
- Bia, what would you do?

344
00:15:56,915 --> 00:15:59,125
I've already been in love at first sight.

345
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:01,127
Like, "Fuck, I love this guy"?

346
00:16:01,127 --> 00:16:03,672
- Yes. On the first day.
- It was not "love," but...

347
00:16:03,672 --> 00:16:04,756
Did it work out?

348
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,508
- We got married.
- You got married?

349
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:07,550
I think he's pondering.

350
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,010
He was honest with Murilo, not a phony.

351
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:10,220
He was really honest.

352
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:13,431
He's not playing.
He's listening to his heart, really.

353
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,266
He likes her because she's awesome.

354
00:16:15,266 --> 00:16:18,561
No, but I think he's saying
all those things to Bia

355
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:19,938
because he regrets it.

356
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:22,107
No, man. I think he likes her, man.

357
00:16:22,107 --> 00:16:23,191
He doesn't like her.

358
00:16:23,191 --> 00:16:25,568
- But it'll end there.
- He's just disturbed.

359
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:29,572
But I don't think so, you know why?
Because they're on vacation in a house

360
00:16:29,572 --> 00:16:33,618
and, in a month... They can never
see each other again, so I don't...

361
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:35,328
Why am I going to talk to someone?

362
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,830
But there's that story...

363
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,998
He's talking to her again
because he has feelings.

364
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:42,168
- Bianca, would you accept his apology?
- I would.

365
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:46,256
- Pabllo?
- I would, but I'd say,

366
00:16:46,256 --> 00:16:52,220
"Look, baby, you have to change,
because like this, we're not gonna last."

367
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:55,807
- Exactly, you have to be clear.
- Either you change or goodbye.

368
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,684
- Carol?
- I've forgiven so many things.

369
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,936
- Love...
- Titto, would you forgive him?

370
00:16:59,936 --> 00:17:01,396
If that happened to you?

371
00:17:01,396 --> 00:17:02,480
Titto...

372
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,773
I want to know...

373
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,486
Let's do this, righteous man.

374
00:17:08,611 --> 00:17:10,572
No, he's a saint. A big, fat saint.

375
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:12,824
Of course he would. Obviously.

376
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:16,911
Do you realize you won't be
100% yourself, right?

377
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:18,913
Are you aware of that?

378
00:17:18,913 --> 00:17:20,039
You can change, man.

379
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:22,542
- I'd forgive, but I'd break up.
- That's okay.

380
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,544
You'd forgive, but you'd break up?

381
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:25,628
I've changed...

382
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:27,589
I would,
depending on how much I loved him,

383
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:29,507
at that moment, and I'd stay, too.

384
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:32,302
But we understood it's not possible.
There's no way.

385
00:17:32,302 --> 00:17:34,387
Have you changed people like that?

386
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,765
"If you want me,
you'll have to stop this."

387
00:17:36,765 --> 00:17:38,475
And the person did so for you?

388
00:17:38,475 --> 00:17:40,769
People don't change, people adapt.

389
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:43,188
Yes, they adapt, but he can do it.

390
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:46,316
I believe people can change.
He can think this over...

391
00:17:46,316 --> 00:17:49,944
A cheater, when the relationship ends,
doesn't stop cheating?

392
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:53,323
Can't he be faithful?
Is he going to cheat forever?

393
00:17:53,323 --> 00:17:55,116
- He can be faithful.
- Then he changed.

394
00:17:55,116 --> 00:17:56,201
No, it's different.

395
00:17:56,201 --> 00:17:58,369
I'm the most sincere person I know.

396
00:17:58,369 --> 00:17:59,996
After me, right? After me.

397
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:02,248
I'm the most sincere person I know.

398
00:18:02,248 --> 00:18:05,043
Then I made a mistake with an ex of mine,

399
00:18:05,043 --> 00:18:09,547
who was extremely hot, I couldn't help it.

400
00:18:09,547 --> 00:18:12,759
- I'm not talking about this.
- No, no. Take it easy.

401
00:18:12,759 --> 00:18:14,469
I made a mistake.

402
00:18:14,469 --> 00:18:16,137
The guy called me and said, "Carol..."

403
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,847
You have that chocolate...

404
00:18:17,847 --> 00:18:21,059
I broke up with a guy
to marry another one, you know?

405
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,353
Then he told me, after five months,

406
00:18:23,353 --> 00:18:26,481
"Hey, Carol, I miss you as a friend.
I miss your friendship.

407
00:18:26,481 --> 00:18:30,819
Can you come over real quick
and have lunch with me just to talk?"

408
00:18:30,819 --> 00:18:32,028
Just to suck me.

409
00:18:32,028 --> 00:18:37,158
As friends.
Then I got a cab and went there.

410
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:39,869
- As friends?
- When I got there, "Hi, how are you?"

411
00:18:39,869 --> 00:18:43,456
But he was extremely hot, man.
"Hey, let's get out of here."

412
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:46,417
And I went with him.
When I got home at night,

413
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:50,129
I had a guilty conscience.
I told the person,

414
00:18:50,129 --> 00:18:53,424
"Man, the other day,
I was in a hotel with so-and-so..."

415
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:55,802
-"I made a mistake."
-"I made a mistake,

416
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:59,806
but, man, if you forgive me,
I won't do that anymore."

417
00:18:59,806 --> 00:19:03,685
When I felt like hooking up with others,
partying and stuff,

418
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:07,689
I broke up with him for two months.
I did all of that...

419
00:19:07,689 --> 00:19:10,149
- I wasn't saying that.
- ...then we got back together.

420
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,695
I'm a woman of character.
I told him. I swear to God I told him.

421
00:19:13,695 --> 00:19:15,363
That's true. You are.

422
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:17,115
But when I was talking about...

423
00:19:17,115 --> 00:19:18,283
About character...

424
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:21,494
You know what's fucked up?

425
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:24,914
Lying your whole life, not telling it.

426
00:19:24,914 --> 00:19:26,082
Cheating...

427
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:29,168
- That is lack of character.
- Cheating... There are lies.

428
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:32,380
- To me, lying is lack of character.
- But I didn't lie.

429
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,257
Pabllo is very quiet today.

430
00:19:34,257 --> 00:19:36,551
- Speechless.
- Just listening to the story.

431
00:19:36,968 --> 00:19:39,470
Carol is the only person
who shocks Pabllo Vittar.

432
00:19:40,263 --> 00:19:42,015
I'm just learning here.

433
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:43,850
Look, it's back.

434
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:50,773
Let's invite these guys.

435
00:19:50,773 --> 00:19:52,317
Let's invite them.

436
00:19:52,317 --> 00:19:53,401
Let's get started.

437
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:57,363
Hi, how are you? Good afternoon.
Here's an invitation for you guys.

438
00:19:57,363 --> 00:20:01,576
This party is tonight, at the lagoon,
downtown, at 7:00 p.m.

439
00:20:01,576 --> 00:20:03,494
They stick together, right?

440
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:05,246
They all soaked their feet, man.

441
00:20:05,246 --> 00:20:07,916
- Those ladies soaked their feet.
- Imagine the foot odor...

442
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:10,168
- Those feet are going to stink.
- Jesus.

443
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:14,130
It's uncomfortable to watch those shoes
getting wet. I even feel my feet itching.

444
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:15,506
Walking with wet shoes.

445
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:22,388
Jeez! It's Thais' friend.

446
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:24,140
- Victoria.
- Victoria, babe!

447
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,476
Did you go to Wolf Maya? You're rich.

448
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:27,477
I did...

449
00:20:27,477 --> 00:20:28,436
Look at Ramon.

450
00:20:28,436 --> 00:20:30,146
- She's beautiful.
- Look at Ramon.

451
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:32,106
Look at those guys...

452
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:33,942
Look...

453
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,947
- I love João.
- João is the best.

454
00:20:38,947 --> 00:20:40,156
What's that, man?

455
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,450
I love it. Guys, she's hot, you know?

456
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,160
João is a naughty boy.

457
00:20:45,203 --> 00:20:46,746
- What's your name?
- Ramon. Yours?

458
00:20:46,746 --> 00:20:48,581
- Victoria.
- Nice to meet you.

459
00:20:48,581 --> 00:20:49,666
Hi...

460
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,750
- How are you?
- All good?

461
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:54,712
- Are you the famous Vic?
- I'm Victoria. Vic.

462
00:20:55,088 --> 00:20:57,298
- Blondie said good things about you.
- Really?

463
00:20:57,298 --> 00:20:59,842
- Welcome.
- How are you, buddy?

464
00:20:59,842 --> 00:21:01,094
I smell like garlic.

465
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:03,638
How are you? You're cooking? That's great.

466
00:21:03,638 --> 00:21:05,306
Let's do something here, right?

467
00:21:06,015 --> 00:21:08,017
- João is feeling sick.
- Why?

468
00:21:08,017 --> 00:21:10,520
Seems like food poisoning. I don't know.

469
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,398
What is it?

470
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:14,983
Is he with someone?

471
00:21:18,486 --> 00:21:20,697
- Is João with her?
- No, it's a joke.

472
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,490
That's cute.

473
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:28,538
João wanted to joke with the girl...

474
00:21:28,538 --> 00:21:30,456
João is fast, right?

475
00:21:30,456 --> 00:21:31,666
He's sharp as a tack.

476
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:35,503
That's the cue for him to ask her,
"Do you remember that joke?

477
00:21:35,503 --> 00:21:36,754
"Let's go make another joke..."

478
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:39,966
- Guys, I loved the fuck room.
- I loved it. Guys, I loved it.

479
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:41,843
Fucking with red lights...
You sweat a lot.

480
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:44,178
The sweat reaches your eyes...

481
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:46,764
- I love sweating.
- I love sweating, too, you know?

482
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:48,224
I like the smell of sweat.

483
00:21:48,224 --> 00:21:51,310
I hate cold. I hate air conditioning.
I hate it.

484
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,645
Sex with the air conditioner on?

485
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:54,188
Do you want to get a cold?

486
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,941
And your dick goes like this,
that's impressive.

487
00:21:56,941 --> 00:21:59,277
Only yours because
other people's get bigger.

488
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:01,195
Really? That's delicious.

489
00:22:02,071 --> 00:22:03,072
The actors' dinner.

490
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:04,157
Voice message from the manager.

491
00:22:04,282 --> 00:22:05,324
Hi, what's up?

492
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:08,161
Today is the big day.
Our party is tonight.

493
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:12,623
I wanted to thank all of you
for your hard work with promotion.

494
00:22:12,749 --> 00:22:15,126
Look at Taynara
holding the cutlery, wonderful.

495
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:17,587
She looks like a Flintstone holding that.

496
00:22:18,588 --> 00:22:20,798
They're a match. Taynara and Murilo.

497
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:25,511
They have to eat after so much booze.

498
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:28,056
- Fuck it.
- Motherfucker.

499
00:22:29,849 --> 00:22:30,975
"Motherfucker."

500
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:33,311
Man, I love Ramon. "Motherfucker."

501
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:34,896
Imagine the manager watching.

502
00:22:34,896 --> 00:22:37,482
He'd say,
"Fuck, he borrowed my boat and he says...

503
00:22:37,482 --> 00:22:39,192
- I'm a motherfucker."
-"Motherfucker."

504
00:22:39,192 --> 00:22:42,111
Last week, they made everyone
get drunk for free at...

505
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:44,614
Imagine him watching everyone
drinking those tequilas...

506
00:22:44,614 --> 00:22:46,032
That "motherfucker."

507
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:49,494
I fear for Luan at a club.

508
00:22:49,494 --> 00:22:52,580
No, tonight,
he'll be a saint like never before.

509
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:57,085
She'll be able to pole dance tonight,
naked, and he'll say, "Yay! I love it!"

510
00:22:57,085 --> 00:22:58,836
He's in her hands now.

511
00:23:03,758 --> 00:23:05,802
She's wearing
a Kardashian-style dress.

512
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:07,345
She wants to cause impact.

513
00:23:07,345 --> 00:23:11,057
- Thais loves little dresses, right?
- She likes moods.

514
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:12,100
João's brother arrived.

515
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,811
- Fuck, he's the spitting image of him.
- Damn! No way.

516
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:17,563
They're the true Jonas Brothers, got it?

517
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:20,650
- That's cute.
- Jonas Brothers.

518
00:23:22,318 --> 00:23:24,237
- Guys...
- They are very retarded, right?

519
00:23:24,237 --> 00:23:26,114
He has a familiar face, that Tomás.

520
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:28,908
No, João's last name is
Turbation, you know?

521
00:23:29,575 --> 00:23:31,369
Man, they must be very cool, right?

522
00:23:31,369 --> 00:23:35,915
No, I'm sorry. "Tomás..."
Jeez, Titto, you're an idiot.

523
00:23:36,833 --> 00:23:38,084
Did you see he was very sad?

524
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:40,503
"My brother didn't come."
Then, he arrived.

525
00:23:41,170 --> 00:23:43,381
Guys, his brother has a familiar face.

526
00:23:43,381 --> 00:23:44,924
Buddy, his brother is hot.

527
00:23:45,591 --> 00:23:47,009
Welcome. Fuck!

528
00:23:47,009 --> 00:23:49,929
- Shapes of beautiful guys.
- Yes. What a cast?

529
00:23:49,929 --> 00:23:53,224
Where do they hide?
These shapes of beautiful guys.

530
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:57,603
I think they're rich. Rich people
are beautiful. "We did that."

531
00:23:57,603 --> 00:24:00,314
- They're all beautiful.
-"Rich people are beautiful."

532
00:24:00,314 --> 00:24:02,275
- I'd fuck both of them.
- I don't think...

533
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:04,652
They're just friends.
They're not brothers.

534
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:06,946
- They're brothers.
- But they don't look alike.

535
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:08,990
- They look alike.
- Of course not.

536
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,616
Not physically, just the height.

537
00:24:16,998 --> 00:24:18,457
What's up, are you excited?

538
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:19,709
We're very excited...

539
00:24:19,709 --> 00:24:20,877
To start drinking.

540
00:24:20,877 --> 00:24:22,962
- I'm drinking for you, girl.
- Drink for me.

541
00:24:22,962 --> 00:24:24,338
You come here with us.

542
00:24:25,590 --> 00:24:27,550
First of all, what's your name?

543
00:24:27,550 --> 00:24:28,718
Renata.

544
00:24:28,718 --> 00:24:30,928
Renata? Tomás... And you?

545
00:24:30,928 --> 00:24:32,638
- Luará.
- Luará?

546
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:35,141
- That's it...
- I'm still learning.

547
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:38,144
- You toasted, you drink it...
- You can use the straw.

548
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:43,191
Your friend is winning.
This way, look, let's do it.

549
00:24:43,733 --> 00:24:44,734
Ouch!

550
00:24:45,443 --> 00:24:46,569
Guys, what is that?

551
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:49,614
- Fuck, I want this Tomás.
- Guys, it's in the family.

552
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:53,075
- João, as usual, is celebrating.
- Look at João, he's a fool, man.

553
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:55,119
He kissed a fucking lot.

554
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:59,540
He kisses a girl and says,
"I kissed her! I kissed her!"

555
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,167
João, I love you.

556
00:25:01,167 --> 00:25:03,002
He should've been
the one getting wedgies...

557
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:06,756
He thought, "I'm going to grow up,
hook up with some girls and celebrate."

558
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:13,721
- The DJ is cute.
- I love it 'cause he's weird.

559
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:16,724
He looks like an old man
from the '60s dancing.

560
00:25:16,724 --> 00:25:18,643
Man, I swear, I'm a big fan of his.

561
00:25:19,393 --> 00:25:22,146
I love it when we give them nicknames.
"Mowgli," "Blondie..."

562
00:25:22,146 --> 00:25:24,232
- The wolf boy...
-"Blondie" is great.

563
00:25:25,358 --> 00:25:29,779
- Pabllo, I like the DJ. Look at him.
- DJ, hit it for me.

564
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,325
I get to be the old uncle joker, right?
That's cool.

565
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:36,369
That was the first joke
I told on this show.

566
00:25:36,369 --> 00:25:39,997
- Guys, Murilo wants everyone to get drunk.
- It was the worst joke ever.

567
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:42,583
- The first one...
- The first and last, please.

568
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:43,668
Wait.

569
00:25:47,213 --> 00:25:50,424
- What? What was that?
- He said she looks amazing.

570
00:25:50,967 --> 00:25:52,718
Do you think I didn't want that, too?

571
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:57,515
I'm loving it, guys.
I love this show. I swear to God.

572
00:25:57,515 --> 00:26:00,059
Tay is hitting on him...

573
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:03,479
- Son of a gun.
- She hooked up with the DJ.

574
00:26:03,479 --> 00:26:05,022
She hooked up with the DJ.

575
00:26:05,022 --> 00:26:06,107
Go, Blondie!

576
00:26:06,107 --> 00:26:08,234
Look who encouraged her. Vic.

577
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:09,986
- The DJ was mine.
- Vic. How cute.

578
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:12,613
Did you hear that? "The DJ was mine."

579
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:13,698
"He was mine."

580
00:26:14,949 --> 00:26:15,950
Damn.

581
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,536
- Girl, no one belongs to no one.
- She's naughty.

582
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:20,496
No one belongs to no one, Carol.

583
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:22,248
- They do.
- No, they don't.

584
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:25,001
They are much more in love now,
after that.

585
00:26:26,043 --> 00:26:28,462
You said it, Carol,
those things make you...

586
00:26:28,462 --> 00:26:31,507
Damn, I was the only one
to notice the DJ, man.

587
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:32,758
And hooked up with him.

588
00:26:32,758 --> 00:26:35,052
Whenever I go to a party,
I'll fight with my ex.

589
00:26:35,052 --> 00:26:36,762
What did you notice? You were sleeping.

590
00:26:36,762 --> 00:26:38,681
I noticed him. I said it to Pabllo.

591
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:39,974
Do you like DJs, Carol?

592
00:26:40,891 --> 00:26:42,560
- I noticed him.
- But do you like DJs?

593
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:45,187
- Do you dig a DJ?
- I found him quiet.

594
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:47,982
- Don't do this.
- Do you hook up with your DJ?

595
00:26:47,982 --> 00:26:49,025
No, don't do that.

596
00:26:49,025 --> 00:26:50,359
- Why?
- Why not?

597
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,569
- Don't do that.
- She does it.

598
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:53,821
- She's already done it.
- Don't do that, man.

599
00:26:54,238 --> 00:26:55,239
Why, man?

600
00:26:55,364 --> 00:26:57,241
I don't hook up with
anyone from my team.

601
00:26:57,241 --> 00:26:58,701
Have you done it
with someone from your team?

602
00:26:58,701 --> 00:27:00,286
Have you given a job to your lover?

603
00:27:00,286 --> 00:27:04,582
No, not in my team because I only work
with friends and family. It's true!

604
00:27:04,582 --> 00:27:05,666
#FRIENDSANDFAMILY

605
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:07,084
Very good. "And family."

606
00:27:07,084 --> 00:27:10,880
Friends and family. But I love
hooking up with the DJ, at least...

607
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,298
If he's a DJ...

608
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:15,426
The DJ, the producer...
A techno DJ at an alternative party.

609
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:19,597
- Any famous DJ or famous producer?
- I can't say.

610
00:27:19,597 --> 00:27:20,931
She picks the DJ rhythm.

611
00:27:20,931 --> 00:27:27,146
I love hooking up with the PR.
I love not getting in line at clubs.

612
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,316
- I love this fetish.
- It has to be a techno DJ.

613
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:31,233
That's cool.

614
00:27:31,233 --> 00:27:33,444
I've given a job to a lover.
He worked with me.

615
00:27:33,444 --> 00:27:36,530
- Hey, attention, DJs, look.
- Lover?

616
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:38,240
You can't have lovers, man.

617
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,325
I love it...

618
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:41,160
But it wasn't a relationship.

619
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,579
DJs, send messages
to Pabllo Vittar's inbox...

620
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:46,207
I used to hook up with a guy.
It was serious.

621
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:47,666
What does it mean for you?

622
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,543
For how long?

623
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:51,587
Three years.

624
00:27:51,587 --> 00:27:54,673
A serious hook-up with her...
Did you kiss him?

625
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:56,258
- Yes.
- It wasn't just his dick?

626
00:27:56,258 --> 00:27:57,343
But was it a relationship?

627
00:27:57,343 --> 00:27:59,303
No. He had a girlfriend.

628
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:01,305
I get steady relationships.
That's how I kiss.

629
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,809
- Did he have a girlfriend, too?
- Yeah.

630
00:28:04,809 --> 00:28:05,893
He was your friend with benefits.

631
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:07,937
- What's this, boy?
- It's a fuck buddy.

632
00:28:07,937 --> 00:28:09,980
- A fuck buddy. It's a dick buddy.
- Yeah.

633
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:12,024
Or pussy buddy.

634
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,026
- What?
- Yeah, pussy buddy.

635
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:16,654
Anyway, I used to hook up with him,

636
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:19,365
so no one could know about him
because he had a girlfriend.

637
00:28:19,365 --> 00:28:21,742
Then I said, "Work with me..."

638
00:28:21,742 --> 00:28:22,827
Ouch, girl.

639
00:28:22,827 --> 00:28:24,829
He became a member of your team...

640
00:28:24,829 --> 00:28:28,124
Was he your lover?
You can't have lovers, Carol.

641
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:31,377
- No, the relationship wasn't...
- There he goes, the saint.

642
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:34,422
- Let's canonize him.
- Shut up, man.

643
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:40,428
I dated someone, and he had a girlfriend.
It was a serious relationship, you know?

644
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:43,222
So you messed things up with him.

645
00:28:43,222 --> 00:28:46,267
You were the reason for the mess.

646
00:28:46,267 --> 00:28:47,685
- No one knew.
- No one?

647
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:50,229
So everything was right,
it was just a mistake.

648
00:28:50,229 --> 00:28:51,480
Just a long mistake.

649
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:52,898
I've hooked up with bloggers.

650
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:54,775
- Blogger boys?
- Yes.

651
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:57,361
- Who? No way.
- I've dated people who worked on TV.

652
00:28:57,361 --> 00:29:01,157
- People who work on TV...
- Who? Tell us names.

653
00:29:01,157 --> 00:29:02,575
- No names.
- No names.

654
00:29:02,575 --> 00:29:06,245
- But I like this party environment.
- How many followers?

655
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:09,248
It's not just that.
It's about the importance in Brazil.

656
00:29:12,251 --> 00:29:13,210
It's not enough...

657
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:14,462
"Importance in Brazil."

658
00:29:14,462 --> 00:29:18,507
How many movies? How many leading roles?
There are a lot of things.

659
00:29:18,507 --> 00:29:21,677
I feel it's Felipe Titto.

660
00:29:21,677 --> 00:29:23,721
No, I'm just an extra on soap operas.

661
00:29:23,721 --> 00:29:26,265
I pass by in the background.
I do this, got it?

662
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,017
I'm not a leading actor.

663
00:29:28,017 --> 00:29:30,728
I don't have lines, just pass by and nod.

664
00:29:30,728 --> 00:29:31,812
That's enough.

665
00:29:31,812 --> 00:29:32,980
No, don't do this.

666
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,898
That's me.

667
00:29:33,898 --> 00:29:35,316
I'm the one who has to talk about you.

668
00:29:35,316 --> 00:29:36,400
That pisses me off.

669
00:29:37,067 --> 00:29:38,319
I don't like it.

670
00:29:38,319 --> 00:29:39,737
Do you hook up with famous people?

671
00:29:39,737 --> 00:29:42,531
No, I'd hook up with Titto...

672
00:29:42,531 --> 00:29:44,700
Jeez, Titto is such an idiot!

673
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,368
I'm going to throw it on Titto's face...

674
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,453
He's that old uncle...

675
00:29:47,453 --> 00:29:50,831
No, I hook up with
cab drivers, fishermen...

676
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:53,542
- I think...
- What did you say about me?

677
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:55,169
Until the last episode,

678
00:29:55,169 --> 00:29:57,630
Titto has to get down with Carol.

679
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:00,591
- Do what with Carol?
- Get down with you.

680
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:02,092
-"To make out"?
-"Making out."

681
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:04,220
- Here's what you'll have to do.
- Can you two peck?

682
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:06,597
Let's play a video game...

683
00:30:06,597 --> 00:30:11,268
You'll be playing with me and then,
"Titto, I'm very tired, I'll sleep."

684
00:30:11,268 --> 00:30:16,148
I'll pass in front of your room,
the door will be open, I'll hear the fan.

685
00:30:16,857 --> 00:30:19,026
No, Titto, it's not like that.

686
00:30:19,026 --> 00:30:20,736
I want you to peck each other...

687
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:22,446
Ramon and Nathalia
are going to make out again.

688
00:30:22,446 --> 00:30:24,365
- No!
- Don't do that.

689
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,825
- Who made out?

690
00:30:29,078 --> 00:30:30,955
- Don't do that.
- Ramon is messing around.

691
00:30:30,955 --> 00:30:31,956
Don't do that.

692
00:30:31,956 --> 00:30:36,877
He deserved it. She learned her lesson.

693
00:30:36,877 --> 00:30:39,380
I didn't like it, girl.

694
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:43,008
- I'm a Scorpio. I don't forget things.
- Scorpio! I hate it!

695
00:30:43,008 --> 00:30:46,428
- I didn't like it.
- I'm with you.

696
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:48,556
Let's go to the afterparty.

697
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:09,368
- You see? I take care.
- I don't see it, girl.

698
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:13,414
- If I see it, I stop you.
- I don't see it.

699
00:31:14,123 --> 00:31:15,583
- Hey, Luan.
- Ramon...

700
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,210
Luan, tell your brother to go there.

701
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:22,381
I can't even leave the kitchen because...
This guard is...

702
00:31:22,381 --> 00:31:24,758
Luan and Nathalia have
a beautiful friendship.

703
00:31:24,758 --> 00:31:27,094
That's true. They're friends.

704
00:31:27,094 --> 00:31:29,847
See how a big fucked-up situation
became a friendship.

705
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:31,765
Come, come, come.

706
00:31:31,765 --> 00:31:33,475
Thais is shit-faced. Look.

707
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:35,561
I know. I trust your potential.

708
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:36,979
Poor girl.

709
00:31:36,979 --> 00:31:39,732
- Pabllo is like Blondie.
- Thais is going to fall backwards.

710
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:41,191
...taking her to the bedroom.

711
00:31:41,191 --> 00:31:42,610
But, girl...

712
00:31:42,610 --> 00:31:46,113
- The DJ will give up. She's shit-faced.
- But a real friend does that.

713
00:31:46,113 --> 00:31:47,656
They are close since day one.

714
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:50,701
The DJ will hook up with the other one.

715
00:31:50,701 --> 00:31:52,036
...I turned too much.

716
00:31:52,036 --> 00:31:54,455
Do you want to take these heels off?

717
00:31:59,126 --> 00:32:00,836
Girl, where are you?

718
00:32:02,838 --> 00:32:03,839
- Bia.
- I don't know.

719
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:06,550
But, Bia, go have fun, relax.
Go have fun. Easy.

720
00:32:06,550 --> 00:32:08,177
- Bia. Go there...
- What is it?

721
00:32:08,177 --> 00:32:11,013
- Nath was causing trouble again, man?
- Yeah, again.

722
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:12,514
She really is a troublemaker.

723
00:32:12,514 --> 00:32:14,558
Jeez, I tried to like Nath, you know?

724
00:32:16,101 --> 00:32:18,312
I really tried.

725
00:32:18,312 --> 00:32:20,147
"Go downstairs, something's going on."

726
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:22,483
Jeez, man.
I am starting to dislike that girl.

727
00:32:22,483 --> 00:32:24,818
Tell that motherfucker to come here.

728
00:32:24,818 --> 00:32:26,528
She's a gossiper.

729
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:29,073
I made us two burgers.

730
00:32:29,073 --> 00:32:31,033
Okay. Let's see what's going on.

731
00:32:31,033 --> 00:32:32,951
He's making a burger for you.

732
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:36,538
Then why did you call me?
Why did you say, "Bia, go downstairs"?

733
00:32:36,538 --> 00:32:38,499
- To eat.
- Baby...

734
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:39,917
Look, Ramon is so cute.

735
00:32:39,917 --> 00:32:43,712
- She's going to be jealous. It's payback.
- No, wait.

736
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:45,339
I'm out of patience.

737
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:46,965
So, you talk to Nath.

738
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,634
Tell her to drop the bullshit...

739
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:50,511
'cause something's wrong.

740
00:32:50,636 --> 00:32:51,929
Yeah. I understand her.

741
00:32:51,929 --> 00:32:55,474
Don't you know me? Do you get it?
You've created...

742
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,227
It's good she goes downstairs...

743
00:32:58,227 --> 00:32:59,770
She walks away...

744
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:02,147
Go after her, make her listen to you.

745
00:33:02,147 --> 00:33:05,734
You talked to me. Know how to talk to me.
Got it? That's it.

746
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:09,655
- Oh, no... I'm out of here.
- I'm not arguing with you, girl.

747
00:33:09,655 --> 00:33:12,658
I'm just trying to explain
that you already know me.

748
00:33:12,658 --> 00:33:15,035
You have to know how to talk.

749
00:33:15,035 --> 00:33:16,787
I loved that she made

750
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:19,206
everyone understand.

751
00:33:19,707 --> 00:33:22,793
The same way you didn't like it,
I also don't like it.

752
00:33:22,793 --> 00:33:24,420
You talk like something's going on.

753
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,504
Jeez!

754
00:33:25,504 --> 00:33:28,757
Wait, Bia, shut up.

755
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:30,968
Then you'll see.

756
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:33,011
I see what's going on.

757
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,764
I did what a friend should do...

758
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:37,599
You said,

759
00:33:37,599 --> 00:33:38,684
"Go downstairs."

760
00:33:38,809 --> 00:33:39,810
You didn't do anything.

761
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:42,229
You said, "Go downstairs, Bia."

762
00:33:42,229 --> 00:33:46,358
Exactly. Not because of him.
Was it because of you?

763
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:47,484
The chick checked me out...

764
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:50,112
People were annoying Luan,

765
00:33:50,112 --> 00:33:52,865
saying he wanted to hook up
with somebody. He didn't.

766
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:54,950
I held him... Am I lying?

767
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:58,120
I held him and said,
"He's not going to hook up with anybody."

768
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,663
He said,
"Are you with the SWAT?"

769
00:33:59,663 --> 00:34:00,956
"She's a cop."

770
00:34:00,956 --> 00:34:04,126
I said, "Yes, 'cause Bia is my friend."
Am I lying?

771
00:34:04,126 --> 00:34:05,836
I'd rather the attitude of a woman.

772
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:07,671
You pointed your finger at me.

773
00:34:07,671 --> 00:34:09,548
Fuck you. If my attitude doesn't...

774
00:34:09,548 --> 00:34:12,009
You don't get to say "fuck you."

775
00:34:12,009 --> 00:34:13,719
I've been by your side...

776
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,930
She's a troublemaker.
She really is. It's annoying.

777
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:18,807
Look, she's drunk and talking shit.

778
00:34:18,807 --> 00:34:20,476
Holy Mother of God.

779
00:34:20,476 --> 00:34:23,562
If she did that thing downstairs,
she didn't have to go upstairs

780
00:34:23,562 --> 00:34:26,440
to make that other chick fight Victoria
because of Luan.

781
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,776
She had sorted it out.
Is she going to involve her?

782
00:34:28,776 --> 00:34:29,693
Isn't she...

783
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:32,696
I think she didn't intend that fight
between Luan and her.

784
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:35,240
The way she explained,
even Luan agreed with her.

785
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:38,118
Separate Luan from those girls,
"Hey, go downstairs..."

786
00:34:38,118 --> 00:34:39,828
That chick was in the pool.

787
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:44,875
"I'll call my friend to grab her man
because there are women hitting on him."

788
00:34:44,875 --> 00:34:48,504
- No, no. No, it's not that.
- Wake up, girl.

789
00:34:48,504 --> 00:34:51,924
I'm saying this in a good way.
Don't point your finger at me.

790
00:34:51,924 --> 00:34:53,467
What, girl?

791
00:34:53,467 --> 00:34:54,635
Wake up.

792
00:34:55,344 --> 00:34:57,095
The afterparty
was better than the party.

793
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,263
It was crazy.

794
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:01,225
Give it up to Victoria,
who got a lot of attention.

795
00:35:01,225 --> 00:35:02,935
What is this? Are you clapping?

796
00:35:02,935 --> 00:35:03,936
My fancy applause.

797
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:05,020
It's applause.

798
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:07,689
Would you like some chocolate?

799
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:10,734
- Spoon-feed her.
- Open your mouth.

800
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:13,695
The little tongue.

801
00:35:13,695 --> 00:35:18,534
If you argue with your friend,
your boyfriend is defending your friend,

802
00:35:18,534 --> 00:35:21,245
he's hooking up with your friend, not you.
I'd be pissed.

803
00:35:21,245 --> 00:35:22,788
- Yeah.
- I'd be fucking pissed.

804
00:35:24,081 --> 00:35:25,541
I'd be fucking pissed.

805
00:35:26,667 --> 00:35:28,627
- What would you be?
- Fucking pissed.

806
00:35:28,627 --> 00:35:31,380
-"Fucking pissed"?
- Fucking pissed.

807
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:34,550
- You can't be like this, fuck.
- Now you're rich.

808
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:37,761
Let me be. I hate it.

809
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:39,429
ON THE NEXT EPISODE

810
00:35:39,429 --> 00:35:41,390
Welcome to our humble home.

811
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:43,517
Murilo will get that boy,
and she's on the floor.

812
00:35:43,517 --> 00:35:45,978
Holy shit, that's fucked up.

813
00:35:45,978 --> 00:35:50,023
- No one cares about fucking anyone.
- Of course they do.

814
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:52,067
No one gives up fucking someone...

815
00:35:52,067 --> 00:35:53,151
Yes, they do.

816
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,528
- Stop it!
- I do.

817
00:35:54,528 --> 00:35:57,865
Jeez, now I'll feel like
a 4'11" girl with Murilo.
