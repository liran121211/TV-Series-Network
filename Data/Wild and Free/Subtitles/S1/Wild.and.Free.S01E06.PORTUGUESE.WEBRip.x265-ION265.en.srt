WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS
THE REVIEW

2
00:00:19,353 --> 00:00:21,856
Guys, where's John?

3
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:24,483
I don't know, but we can't pretend
he's not here.

4
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:27,653
- Yeah. Look at this.
- My God!

5
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:36,495
You say that you love me when you drink
But your mouth prefers me

6
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:38,372
Dear Lord, bro!

7
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,624
That's talent, right, guys?

8
00:00:43,335 --> 00:00:45,254
- What is it, man?
- Get up, girl.

9
00:00:45,254 --> 00:00:47,047
Oh, my gosh.

10
00:00:47,047 --> 00:00:49,175
That's great, man.

11
00:00:51,093 --> 00:00:53,220
Look at the heels!

12
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:54,972
These are phantom heels, girl!

13
00:00:54,972 --> 00:00:56,974
- These are phantom heels.
- And he tiptoes!

14
00:00:56,974 --> 00:00:59,310
I thought there were heels.

15
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,811
- Me, too.
- Here! He's here!

16
00:01:00,811 --> 00:01:02,938
Previously, Tay and João had an argument,

17
00:01:02,938 --> 00:01:05,232
she was dumped by Murilo,
bad vibe in the house.

18
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:07,943
And I don't know
what is going to happen today.

19
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:09,862
Let's press play real good? I'm beat...

20
00:01:09,862 --> 00:01:11,030
Go, Titto. Kill it.

21
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:12,823
- What's up?
- What's up, ma?

22
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:15,910
- Beautiful image.
- Our palette.

23
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:19,038
It's like that meme,
I woke up early to watch that sunset.

24
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,253
Oh, my God, look at this house.

25
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:28,881
- It's the dynamite couple.
- Look, girl.

26
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:33,803
It's better than crying in front
of the cameras saying you're heartbroken.

27
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:35,721
Look into my eyes
and say you feel nothing.

28
00:01:35,721 --> 00:01:37,973
- Booze.
- We said she was going to regret it.

29
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,058
Yes...

30
00:01:39,809 --> 00:01:42,019
At least, it's an eye for an eye.

31
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:43,521
Crying over a broken heart,
that's a shame.

32
00:01:43,521 --> 00:01:45,105
Shame, look. It's regret.

33
00:01:45,105 --> 00:01:46,232
See? That's booze.

34
00:01:46,232 --> 00:01:47,525
But she's a real friend.

35
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:50,069
She's telling the truth
about her acting like a fool.

36
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:53,239
A true friend says,
"You've made a fool of yourself."

37
00:01:53,239 --> 00:01:55,199
-"You were quite ridiculous."
- Yeah...

38
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:57,409
So... In the bathroom...

39
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,370
I don't remember what you said...

40
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:02,248
- I heard João saying some stuff to Murilo.
- Seriously?

41
00:02:02,248 --> 00:02:04,500
He said,
"You're going to be a player again?

42
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,626
Back to the game."

43
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:07,837
They fought in the bathroom.

44
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:10,214
I said, "I can't believe he did that..."

45
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:12,550
Are you making a fool of me?

46
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:14,468
Hey, people, for Christ's sake.

47
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:16,136
They're already fighting?

48
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,598
She was honest.
She said she was hurt because...

49
00:02:19,598 --> 00:02:21,475
not because she's getting too involved,

50
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:24,311
but she has feelings for him
and he said those meant nothing.

51
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:27,064
- I wouldn't do that, you know?
- Oh, no...

52
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:29,275
- Okay...
- He was honest, and so was she...

53
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:30,484
- Life goes on.
- He was honest.

54
00:02:30,484 --> 00:02:31,610
What do you think?

55
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,904
They have to talk
or each one of them moves on?

56
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,406
I think it won't work anymore...

57
00:02:35,406 --> 00:02:37,074
They have to enjoy the days they have...

58
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,951
- But if they enjoy it together...
- If it's already bad, he won't.

59
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:41,370
- It's true...
- She'll be the only person to enjoy it

60
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:42,955
because she's with him.

61
00:02:42,955 --> 00:02:44,957
- But if they...

62
00:02:44,957 --> 00:02:47,084
- Why?
- Because he wants to party all the time.

63
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:49,545
She's attached to him.
If they become a couple...

64
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:52,548
He won't enjoy it.
But if they go their separate ways,

65
00:02:52,548 --> 00:02:54,884
she'll get hurt, and he'll party.

66
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:56,802
- Got it?
- But she...

67
00:02:56,802 --> 00:02:58,846
- There's this middle ground.
- Exactly.

68
00:02:58,846 --> 00:03:00,055
It's a two-day fling.

69
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,181
She'll get over it quickly.

70
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,892
- Yeah...
- In Floripa... Yeah.

71
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:07,521
- Guys, work cell phone.
- Cell phone. Where's the phone?

72
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:10,524
How do I answer it?

73
00:03:11,066 --> 00:03:15,195
- Hello? Hold on. That's hard...
- Who is this?

74
00:03:16,322 --> 00:03:19,158
- It's Amanda!
- Who is this? Is it for you?

75
00:03:20,034 --> 00:03:22,077
I like it.

76
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:24,246
That's what friends are for.

77
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,540
- She cried...
- Guys, this is beautiful.

78
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,127
She'll have someone to trust,
outside that house.

79
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:31,962
- Yeah.
- She cries a lot.

80
00:03:33,797 --> 00:03:34,882
Why is she crying?

81
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:37,718
Because she's in bad shape.
She's in bad shape.

82
00:03:37,718 --> 00:03:38,969
She cries too much.

83
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:42,097
She's emotional, but if Bia says,
"Girl, I've paid..."

84
00:03:42,097 --> 00:03:43,474
Carol is quiet...

85
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:46,310
I also cry when my friends call me.

86
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:49,480
That's cute.
Her friend called to meet her.

87
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,566
I'd cry because they're going to eat
all the food in my fridge.

88
00:03:55,653 --> 00:04:00,157
We're gonna go to this party.
Let's drink before.

89
00:04:00,574 --> 00:04:04,286
I have nowhere to stay.

90
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:05,621
It's crazy, girl...

91
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:10,501
- Two days?
- But the stress, arguments...

92
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:11,877
Baby, it's intense...

93
00:04:11,877 --> 00:04:14,672
Boy, two days of booze
and she's crying like that?

94
00:04:14,672 --> 00:04:19,927
When you're out on tour, after two days,
do you feel homesick?

95
00:04:19,927 --> 00:04:24,264
But two days getting wasted,
how will you be homesick at that point?

96
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,225
But she got upset...

97
00:04:26,225 --> 00:04:29,478
Titto, what makes you cry?

98
00:04:29,478 --> 00:04:33,399
When my female friends call me, telling me
they're coming to my place, I cry.

99
00:04:33,399 --> 00:04:36,151
- Yeah?
- Oh, my God.

100
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,695
I'm kidding, of course not.

101
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:38,904
I don't have female friends.

102
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:42,157
I'd cry. I'm emotional in a house,

103
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:46,370
and there's been two days I'm getting
acquainted with these people.

104
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:47,871
You're here with us.

105
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,082
If I say I'll meet you at your place,
will you cry?

106
00:04:50,082 --> 00:04:51,166
Yes, I will.

107
00:04:51,917 --> 00:04:53,711
- You're emotional...
- Hit play.

108
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:00,426
May the night be unforgettable!

109
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:02,261
It's gonna be! Amen. Amen.

110
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:04,805
Better than yesterday
and worse than tomorrow!

111
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:10,102
What is ours is ours!
It will always be ours!

112
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,732
Guys, João...

113
00:05:14,857 --> 00:05:17,484
- She arrived.
- Is that her? I loved her look.

114
00:05:17,484 --> 00:05:19,111
She seems to have a good vibe.

115
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:21,864
- Will she do Pilates there?
- She didn't drink...

116
00:05:21,864 --> 00:05:23,574
Yes... I loved her.

117
00:05:23,574 --> 00:05:24,908
She's a sociologist.

118
00:05:24,908 --> 00:05:26,243
She'll light some incense.

119
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:27,244
Social science for sure...

120
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:28,871
She went to sociology school.

121
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:31,206
No, she can be a good person
to go out with,

122
00:05:31,206 --> 00:05:33,500
a friendly person, "Stop it, don't fight."

123
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:36,170
Or, "Let's drink and go skinny dipping."

124
00:05:36,170 --> 00:05:37,838
That one who's arrived?

125
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,506
- She drinks kombucha.
- What?

126
00:05:39,506 --> 00:05:41,592
She won't do anything. Look at her.

127
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:44,344
- Don't judge a book by its cover.
- Why not?

128
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:46,472
There are some good vibe people
who nail it.

129
00:05:46,472 --> 00:05:49,683
I'm just saying
she doesn't look like a party girl.

130
00:05:49,683 --> 00:05:53,645
Yeah... She looks like
she digs vegan food, meditation.

131
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:54,855
Mystical stones...

132
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:57,357
- Exactly. She prays with crystals...
- Let's see...

133
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,335
- You got to enjoy it!
- Fuck, you got to enjoy it!

134
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:17,544
Let's enjoy it, come!

135
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:20,339
- That's it.
- She's already with... with Ramon.

136
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:24,009
- Man, I am...
- She takes initiative, huh?

137
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:27,012
Guys, I think that friend
is going to hook up with Murilo.

138
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:30,599
Or she might think,
"They're not together," and just...

139
00:06:30,599 --> 00:06:33,602
No, she's her friend.
If she said she's in love...

140
00:06:33,602 --> 00:06:35,312
I don't agree with that.

141
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,231
She just said she cried...

142
00:06:37,231 --> 00:06:39,817
I already hooked up
with my best friend. No...

143
00:06:39,817 --> 00:06:41,860
That's not new, right?

144
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,612
- I did.
- That's not wrong.

145
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:47,366
Wrong is hooking up
with your friend's crush. Or girlfriend.

146
00:06:47,366 --> 00:06:49,993
I'm a person of character when I'm sober.

147
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:53,122
When I drink, I'm not.
There's nothing, just sex.

148
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:56,208
I'll hide my boys from you.

149
00:06:56,208 --> 00:07:01,296
Sex, sex, sex
Nonstop, nonstop

150
00:07:01,296 --> 00:07:03,924
- Look, look!
- I love it!

151
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:05,717
- Mischief.
- I want to see, huh?

152
00:07:06,552 --> 00:07:09,054
Guys, she was the last one
to arrive at that house.

153
00:07:09,054 --> 00:07:10,681
She should know what's up.

154
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:12,015
Yeah, she went crazy.

155
00:07:12,015 --> 00:07:15,936
She has the right to party.
She'll be there for two days.

156
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:19,439
No, girl, she's just arrived.
She has to understand the atmosphere.

157
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,525
She's staying for two days
and is going crazy.

158
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:24,444
I arrive like this.
I'm quiet, she's quiet.

159
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:28,073
Just don't hook up with my boy, look.

160
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:30,409
If you do it with my boy,
I'm gonna kick your ass.

161
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:31,618
"If you hook up with my boy..."

162
00:07:31,618 --> 00:07:33,495
I'm going to kick your ass.

163
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,874
- It's not like that.
- We are best friends.

164
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:39,084
It's a deal. This boy is yours.

165
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:41,378
But, man, think about it...

166
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:45,424
I'm a little interested
in hooking up with your boy.

167
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:50,179
But never mind, this boy is not yours.
This boy is... He gets to...

168
00:07:50,179 --> 00:07:52,055
- Ouch...
- It's true.

169
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,057
Guys, I'm like her.

170
00:07:54,057 --> 00:07:55,684
That one who hooks up with everyone?

171
00:07:55,684 --> 00:07:57,561
I'm authentic. She speaks her mind.

172
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,897
- I'll hide my boy from you.
- Do it.

173
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:03,442
Everyone is on vacation having fun.
She's getting attached.

174
00:08:03,442 --> 00:08:04,693
He'll drink and kiss another girl.

175
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:06,778
Everyone can hook up with anyone now...

176
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:08,488
The thing is she's just arrived.

177
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,824
Don't get attached.
You can date afterwards.

178
00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:13,493
She barely arrived and wants to take
advantage of the situation.

179
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,370
What would you do if you were her?

180
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:17,164
I wouldn't do anything.

181
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:21,460
You would say no, but as soon as you
had the chance, you'd go for it.

182
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,087
You wouldn't have the guts to admit it.
She did.

183
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,173
She had. I think that's awesome.

184
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:27,799
Got it? She didn't lie.

185
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,509
She didn't lie.
I can't stand lies.

186
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:32,471
Mariano, what would you do?

187
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:34,473
I think like Titto.

188
00:08:34,473 --> 00:08:37,351
I wouldn't want to either.
It has happened to me before.

189
00:08:37,351 --> 00:08:38,894
- Have you done it?
- No.

190
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:40,020
It's already happened to me.

191
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,605
Once, a friend's girl hit on me...

192
00:08:41,605 --> 00:08:42,898
They're not friends.

193
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:43,899
Guys, just think.

194
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:45,192
Only two days!

195
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:48,362
- There's been two days. Two days.
- Everyone is free.

196
00:08:48,362 --> 00:08:51,240
Where's that freedom
we were talking about?

197
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:52,741
You can't do this to a friend.

198
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:54,785
What friend? He's not my friend.

199
00:08:54,785 --> 00:08:58,121
The problem is getting
there just to do that.

200
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,334
What I'm about to say
is going to sound like bullshit,

201
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,878
but I'll take the risk and say it.

202
00:09:05,462 --> 00:09:08,966
Don't get me wrong, women,
but, between men,

203
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:11,677
there's a thing,
there's a different kind of respect.

204
00:09:11,677 --> 00:09:13,136
Of loyalty.

205
00:09:13,136 --> 00:09:14,388
There's no such thing!

206
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:17,140
From my perspective, a man who shakes
another man's hand and says,

207
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,558
"Look, she's my girlfriend."

208
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,851
I believe it.

209
00:09:19,851 --> 00:09:21,895
"From now on, she's off-limits."

210
00:09:21,895 --> 00:09:23,480
- Exactly.
- I've seen

211
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,982
so many nasty boys...

212
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:26,566
...who say what you said and then...

213
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,236
I'd never hook up
with a friend's girl.

214
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:34,992
Man, usually, a guy doesn't hook up
with a friend's girl,

215
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:36,451
but when they break up, he does.

216
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:38,912
That person is not a friend.

217
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,706
That means that person is dead?

218
00:09:40,706 --> 00:09:42,040
What? Are you nuts?

219
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,542
Do you hook up with your friend's ex?

220
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:44,751
I already did.

221
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,253
He's not your friend.

222
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:48,130
He's my friend, but it's history.

223
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:49,965
He's dating now. This is history.

224
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:52,801
Boyfriend is different than fling, right?

225
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:54,303
Fling is one thing.

226
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:57,222
If he's your friend
and dated a woman for two years,

227
00:09:57,222 --> 00:10:00,017
- she's dead to me.
- Listen,

228
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:03,145
"A deal is a deal."
No one made any arrangements.

229
00:10:03,145 --> 00:10:06,773
If he said he wouldn't hook up with her,
that's okay, he gave his word.

230
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,192
But no, there was no such thing.

231
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,527
Those girls are...

232
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:12,195
They pretend to be not attached,

233
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:16,616
but when things get complicated, they say,
"Are you going to dance with that girl?"

234
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,577
But there's no deal yet.

235
00:10:18,577 --> 00:10:20,120
No one is committed yet.

236
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,582
- She's just friends with Tay.
- That's fair.

237
00:10:23,582 --> 00:10:27,002
If she hooks up with Tay's boyfriend,
it's going to be messed up.

238
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:28,045
I don't agree with that.

239
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:30,088
But if she hooks up
with the other girls' boyfriends...

240
00:10:30,088 --> 00:10:32,299
Let's watch and see.

241
00:10:32,299 --> 00:10:34,551
It's wrong to say she'll kick her ass.

242
00:10:34,551 --> 00:10:38,847
But she's not wrong. She was honest.
She was herself, you know?

243
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:40,849
Let's see.

244
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,268
We were getting along.

245
00:10:43,268 --> 00:10:45,312
Good, because you made a little mess.

246
00:10:45,312 --> 00:10:47,272
What did I come here for?

247
00:10:47,272 --> 00:10:50,108
-"What did I come here for?"
- Did she say that?

248
00:10:50,108 --> 00:10:52,652
- That she made a mess.
- She's a Leo.

249
00:10:53,195 --> 00:10:56,156
When people talk about star signs,
things will get bad.

250
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:57,115
- What's her star sign?
- Leo...

251
00:10:57,115 --> 00:10:58,575
When people talk about star signs...

252
00:10:58,575 --> 00:11:00,660
And she wants to teach
her friend a lesson.

253
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,788
I'm not jealous, man.

254
00:11:02,788 --> 00:11:04,373
Yes, you are.

255
00:11:04,373 --> 00:11:07,167
What would you do if someone
wanted to kiss your boy?

256
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:10,754
- You're not a couple.
- You can't judge others, girl.

257
00:11:10,879 --> 00:11:12,881
You are all too committed.

258
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,175
You can't judge others.

259
00:11:15,175 --> 00:11:17,302
You don't know what they're going through.

260
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:20,013
No one knows what's going on.

261
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,014
She wants to send...

262
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,224
Ramon hit on her, right...

263
00:11:22,224 --> 00:11:24,476
I can't judge. Two days...

264
00:11:24,476 --> 00:11:26,019
She wants to send her friend back.

265
00:11:26,019 --> 00:11:28,355
Ramon hit on Amanda!

266
00:11:28,355 --> 00:11:30,732
Look, look, look. Oh, fuck...

267
00:11:30,732 --> 00:11:32,818
- Who is that?
- It's Luan.

268
00:11:32,818 --> 00:11:34,611
Fuck!

269
00:11:35,487 --> 00:11:38,240
Now I'm enjoying it. We'll talk later.

270
00:11:42,577 --> 00:11:44,871
What did she say? What did she say?

271
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,207
"Now I'm enjoying it. We'll talk later."

272
00:11:47,207 --> 00:11:49,751
- Awesome. Give me this.
- Switch with me.

273
00:11:52,003 --> 00:11:54,256
I guess she's going to the afterparty.

274
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,341
You must be five foot eight-point-five.

275
00:11:56,341 --> 00:11:58,552
Is he going to kiss another girl?

276
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,345
I am five foot three.

277
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:02,180
Ouch, it's not going to be her.

278
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,725
What about João, bro?
Once again, he is the insignificant one.

279
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,185
All the girls are attached.

280
00:12:07,185 --> 00:12:09,980
One is fighting for him,
and he's with another girl.

281
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:13,066
Let me say something.
Do you know what's going on?

282
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,776
The girls know what she's doing,

283
00:12:14,776 --> 00:12:16,903
but the boys don't know
what she's doing yet.

284
00:12:16,903 --> 00:12:19,156
- The one who arrived at the house.
- Amanda.

285
00:12:19,156 --> 00:12:20,532
Amanda.

286
00:12:20,532 --> 00:12:24,327
The girls already know
she intends to hook up with someone.

287
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:26,163
The boys don't know yet.

288
00:12:26,163 --> 00:12:30,250
The girls are pissed
and the boys are pissed at the girls.

289
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,585
"I'm not doing anything!"

290
00:12:31,585 --> 00:12:34,212
The girls are attached to those men,
and they don't care.

291
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:35,464
I think the same way.

292
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:37,674
You think they can't separate
their feelings?

293
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:40,051
The girls are too attached and fighting...

294
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:41,678
"Don't hook up with my boy."

295
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:43,013
And he's with another girl.

296
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:47,017
Do you agree those girls are attached
to the boys, and the boys are partying?

297
00:12:47,017 --> 00:12:50,353
She's fighting for one
who's already with another girl.

298
00:12:50,353 --> 00:12:51,730
She should be with another guy.

299
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:53,106
She shouldn't be dating.

300
00:12:53,106 --> 00:12:55,025
Carol, would you be this attached or not?

301
00:12:55,692 --> 00:12:57,235
No, I wouldn't either.

302
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,029
She almost had a heart attack...

303
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:02,324
Imagine you see your boy
at the club with another girl...

304
00:13:02,324 --> 00:13:04,868
I would have a heart attack
in the bathroom.

305
00:13:04,868 --> 00:13:07,954
- But you wouldn't demand anything, right?
- I wouldn't say anything.

306
00:13:14,044 --> 00:13:15,712
- Go kiss her!
- I've already kissed her.

307
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,088
Kiss her again. For real.

308
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:19,591
A real kiss.

309
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:26,848
Looks like he's a good kisser.

310
00:13:26,848 --> 00:13:28,975
Looks like he does, but he just kisses...

311
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:32,604
- He's like that 14-year-old boy...
- He admitted it, buddy.

312
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:34,648
Who went to the matinee, kissed a lot...

313
00:13:34,648 --> 00:13:37,567
But someone who likes kissing
is a good kisser.

314
00:13:37,567 --> 00:13:40,028
Yeah, each person is good at... Expert.

315
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:42,113
There are people who don't know
how to kiss...

316
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:43,406
Really don't know how to kiss...

317
00:13:43,406 --> 00:13:45,200
Carol...

318
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,284
What about Carol?

319
00:13:46,284 --> 00:13:48,203
I'm saying
he must be a really good kisser.

320
00:13:48,203 --> 00:13:50,205
She lives in a different reality.

321
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,541
There are guys
who don't know how to kiss...

322
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:53,917
It's like she doesn't like to kiss.

323
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:56,336
She only kisses
who she loves, right, Carol?

324
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,295
Are you a good kisser?

325
00:13:57,295 --> 00:13:58,421
I've learned, right?

326
00:13:58,421 --> 00:13:59,422
I must...

327
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,092
- I must be...
- I love it!

328
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:03,635
When you guys go to a club...

329
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:04,803
But do you know why?

330
00:14:04,803 --> 00:14:05,845
Do you know why?

331
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:07,389
For me, kissing...

332
00:14:07,389 --> 00:14:09,849
Kissing has a lot of feelings involved,
you know?

333
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,476
What about fucking? I see...

334
00:14:11,476 --> 00:14:13,812
That one...

335
00:14:13,812 --> 00:14:17,023
But how do you know... about feelings
if you don't kiss anyone?

336
00:14:17,566 --> 00:14:19,359
How do you know you're in love?

337
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,403
So, you fall in love for sex.

338
00:14:21,778 --> 00:14:22,654
How do you know you're in love?

339
00:14:22,654 --> 00:14:23,947
She falls in love for sex.

340
00:14:23,947 --> 00:14:26,199
No, but I kiss one person
or another, get it?

341
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,743
But I don't kiss every guy I hook up with.

342
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,163
- Did you hear that?
- Who?

343
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:34,416
"I don't kiss every guy I hook up with."

344
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:38,003
I make an exception for
one or another. The guy has...

345
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:40,922
- Has to kiss you?
- The guy has a pretty mouth.

346
00:14:40,922 --> 00:14:42,007
You eventually fall in love?

347
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,842
Then I make an exception...

348
00:14:43,842 --> 00:14:44,759
You're at the club...

349
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,303
Those you don't make an exception for...

350
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:47,262
What?

351
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:48,471
...you spread your legs?

352
00:14:48,471 --> 00:14:50,140
- Yeah.
- But if I...

353
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,225
No, but you say to him,
"No kissing." Right?

354
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:55,228
I don't say anything.
The dude comes and I... "Hey, buddy..."

355
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,271
Hey...

356
00:14:56,271 --> 00:14:57,606
He bangs you, right?

357
00:14:57,606 --> 00:14:58,565
You know a guy at a club

358
00:14:58,565 --> 00:15:00,483
and you tell him to suck your pussy?

359
00:15:00,483 --> 00:15:03,445
I don't go to clubs. I go to funk parties.

360
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:04,779
The guy fucks your pussy right away?

361
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:05,947
Did you hear what she said?

362
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:06,990
"I go to funk parties."

363
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,409
Then I rub up against someone... What?

364
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:12,120
Okay, you rub up against someone...

365
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,414
He fucks your pussy
and you don't kiss at any moment?

366
00:15:14,414 --> 00:15:15,582
At any moment.

367
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,834
But I don't even rub up
against anyone.

368
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,546
And the dude already knows what I want.

369
00:15:21,546 --> 00:15:25,467
What about when you're in the missionary
position? Looking you in the eyes?

370
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:28,178
- No, no.
- It's too much, man...

371
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:31,139
I'm going to put
her on an altar, at home, like this.

372
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:34,934
I've never been through this...

373
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,772
But I think that if I have a relationship
with someone...

374
00:15:38,772 --> 00:15:42,567
I'd rather he cheats on me with sex.

375
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:45,445
Like, "Carol, I had sex...
I was in need..."

376
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:47,989
- But when do you kiss?
- I don't know... What?

377
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,867
When do you find out
this person deserves a kiss?

378
00:15:51,451 --> 00:15:53,286
I already have someone, got it?

379
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,413
How did you know he was the one?

380
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:56,873
Because she goes to church.

381
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,918
He's from church...

382
00:15:59,918 --> 00:16:01,002
Mouth is very...

383
00:16:01,002 --> 00:16:02,337
Carol is a case study.

384
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:03,922
It's something very intimate.

385
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:06,174
I don't know
where the guy put his mouth yesterday.

386
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:07,175
- Carol.
- And the...

387
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:09,427
He could've put his dick in a dead goat.

388
00:16:09,427 --> 00:16:10,679
There's a condom, boy.

389
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:12,222
Let me tell you...

390
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:14,057
- She uses condoms.
- There's a condom.

391
00:16:14,057 --> 00:16:18,895
- Carol should be studied.
- Carol is like a medical specimen.

392
00:16:18,895 --> 00:16:21,606
Carol is the only woman
who shocks Pabllo Vittar.

393
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,149
It's true!

394
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,734
"Don't you kiss?"

395
00:16:24,734 --> 00:16:26,945
I'm not shocked. I'm learning lessons.

396
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:28,738
- Learning...
- I'm learning, too.

397
00:16:28,738 --> 00:16:29,906
A life workshop.

398
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:33,159
People say I have no feelings,
but I really do, got it?

399
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,120
It's just... They're just hidden...

400
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,831
Because I have feelings...
That's it. Kissing is...

401
00:16:37,831 --> 00:16:40,625
It's about a lot of feelings. Anyway...

402
00:16:40,834 --> 00:16:41,751
Let's play.

403
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,587
Can you get me a cigarette?

404
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,965
- Yes, I can.
- And a kiss?

405
00:16:48,967 --> 00:16:50,051
I can, too.

406
00:16:51,261 --> 00:16:53,138
Are we allowed to kiss?

407
00:16:54,431 --> 00:16:56,349
Tay hooked up with another guy, look!

408
00:16:56,808 --> 00:16:59,102
All right, Tay, beat Murilo.

409
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,438
But you know why she did it, right?

410
00:17:01,896 --> 00:17:06,484
She hooked up with him in front of João,
then João will say something.

411
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,904
- Is she doing that in front of João?
- Look.

412
00:17:09,904 --> 00:17:12,490
She stains everyone with lipstick.
Her signature.

413
00:17:12,490 --> 00:17:14,492
- I already kissed.
- Really?

414
00:17:14,492 --> 00:17:15,785
Jesus.

415
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:17,328
She's talking to João?

416
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:20,123
Hey, exactly.
Then João will tell him. Damn!

417
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:21,916
I'll say, fuck!

418
00:17:21,916 --> 00:17:23,418
I'm a bandit, fuck.

419
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:26,212
- What are you?
- I'm a bandit, I do this, guys.

420
00:17:27,005 --> 00:17:30,341
- I'm shocked.
- She's doing this to tease him.

421
00:17:30,341 --> 00:17:32,010
When you want to affect someone,

422
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:34,179
you do things in front of his best friend.

423
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:36,389
You don't show it...

424
00:17:36,389 --> 00:17:38,349
You hook up with someone
in front of his friend.

425
00:17:38,349 --> 00:17:41,269
- This friend will tell the person.
- This is strategy.

426
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,313
And the person will think you don't care.

427
00:17:43,313 --> 00:17:44,939
He's very jealous, man.

428
00:17:45,231 --> 00:17:46,149
Let's bounce.

429
00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:54,783
- Invite your chicks.
- Do we have a deal?

430
00:17:58,036 --> 00:17:59,746
João is not going to have sex.

431
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:03,750
Carol, you're experienced,
what do you think?

432
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,960
I think he's not going to have sex...

433
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,213
Because he's very anxious to...

434
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:09,422
Maybe in the last episode.

435
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:25,980
- You kissed a lot of people, didn't you?
- You kissed seven.

436
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:27,357
- Seven?
- I counted.

437
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:30,109
Seven? Look at João, huh?

438
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,654
I kissed one person,
I think it was too much.

439
00:18:32,654 --> 00:18:35,782
- You kissed seven people.
- I'm not a fucker, I'm a kisser.

440
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:40,995
Didn't I say he's not a fucker, buddy?
He's just a kisser.

441
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:43,331
"I'm not a fucker, I'm a kisser."

442
00:18:43,331 --> 00:18:46,042
- Did you guys notice she...
- Carol, what do you think?

443
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,001
Hit pause.

444
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:49,254
Pause, pause.

445
00:18:49,254 --> 00:18:50,922
No one cared about her...

446
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:54,175
She said, "I kissed one person,"
in front of Murilo.

447
00:18:54,175 --> 00:18:57,971
- She wanted to mention she kissed too.
- She's a bandit, too.

448
00:19:00,014 --> 00:19:01,349
Will they have sex today?

449
00:19:01,349 --> 00:19:02,517
Murilo and Tay?

450
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:04,060
- What?
- I hope so.

451
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:06,980
I think they won't.
I think they'll fight again...

452
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,441
Holy shit. One kissed in front
of the other, by their side...

453
00:19:10,441 --> 00:19:13,111
I, Kimberly, think they're
going to have sex...

454
00:19:13,111 --> 00:19:14,571
- Who are you?
- Kimberly.

455
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:16,072
I think they won't have sex.

456
00:19:16,072 --> 00:19:19,242
Or they're going to have sex, but they
won't have a healthy relationship.

457
00:19:19,242 --> 00:19:20,785
Bianca, and you?

458
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:23,997
I think they're in a troubling moment
until they figure it out,

459
00:19:23,997 --> 00:19:26,833
but they can do it.
It's clear they like each other.

460
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,085
I don't even wanna talk to you.

461
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:30,962
You got to respect my brother here.

462
00:19:33,214 --> 00:19:36,634
- So the chicks that were here left.
- Did you kiss one of them?

463
00:19:36,634 --> 00:19:39,679
- I just kissed one person.
- No, you kissed the ginger.

464
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,598
- It was just a peck...
- It was a French kiss.

465
00:19:41,598 --> 00:19:45,810
No, I didn't. It was a peck. She bit
my lip and I left. I said, "No."

466
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:48,229
- No, bro, you used your tongue.
- Buddy, no.

467
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,230
I kissed one person.

468
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,608
- Come on, bro. I saw it.
- One mouth.

469
00:19:51,608 --> 00:19:53,568
She is a liar. That's disgusting.

470
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:55,320
You're mistaken.

471
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,989
Who is a liar? Me?

472
00:19:57,989 --> 00:19:59,449
That's fucked up.

473
00:19:59,449 --> 00:20:00,366
- No, girl... People...
- No, it was Murilo. That was it.

474
00:20:00,366 --> 00:20:01,284
It wasn't like that.

475
00:20:01,284 --> 00:20:02,744
He likes her too.
Otherwise, he wouldn't be mad like that.

476
00:20:02,744 --> 00:20:03,912
It's not... Crossfire, son.

477
00:20:03,912 --> 00:20:05,038
I think he should...

478
00:20:05,038 --> 00:20:06,164
They like each other.

479
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,457
That little scene...

480
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:10,001
They tease each other.
It's a teasing game.

481
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:11,044
That's it.

482
00:20:11,044 --> 00:20:11,961
It's not like...

483
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:14,589
- But it's good.
- It's good, but that's it.

484
00:20:14,589 --> 00:20:16,758
She was going to kiss
someone in front of João.

485
00:20:16,883 --> 00:20:19,218
I kissed one person,
I'm not gonna expose the chick.

486
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,470
I'm not a brat.

487
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,305
- I told you. I told you he kissed.
- Muzinho, say you kissed somebody.

488
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:24,849
Fuck off. I respected you, you know?

489
00:20:24,849 --> 00:20:26,935
- And I didn't respect you?
- You know shit.

490
00:20:26,935 --> 00:20:31,439
- Didn't I respect you?
- You don't know half of it.

491
00:20:31,439 --> 00:20:34,359
You're a fake. I'm disgusted.
Please. I'm gonna go...

492
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:36,235
You got to impose respect.

493
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:38,112
Want to be respected?

494
00:20:38,112 --> 00:20:40,907
If you can't handle it, don't play.
Don't bother me.

495
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:41,908
She's totally right.

496
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:43,868
She pissed him off. That's it.

497
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:44,911
Dude is... Yes.

498
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:46,412
But let me tell you... Yeah.

499
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:48,373
Now he's going to want her even more.

500
00:20:48,373 --> 00:20:49,666
- I don't know.
- Go...

501
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:50,792
It's going to become a grudge.

502
00:20:50,792 --> 00:20:52,710
Not now, but after a while...

503
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:53,753
It's a very dangerous game.

504
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,338
That grudge makes you horny.

505
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:56,756
Who wants to fuck again, got it?

506
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:57,840
That João is the crying one.

507
00:20:57,966 --> 00:20:59,926
But, guys, it's a very dangerous game

508
00:20:59,926 --> 00:21:02,303
because it's going to get tough.
She won't stand it

509
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,931
- because you've seen...
- Let's see if she will or won't.

510
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,016
Maybe she doesn't want him anymore...

511
00:21:07,016 --> 00:21:07,934
She wants it...

512
00:21:07,934 --> 00:21:09,268
See if he'll do the same.

513
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,020
...to hook up with someone
in front of João.

514
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:12,605
Did he hook up with
any girl in front of her?

515
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:15,858
No. Let's see if he'll do the same.
If he does,

516
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:18,736
it's because he's pissed,
he has feelings, too.

517
00:21:19,362 --> 00:21:21,990
I think it's bad for both of them.

518
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:23,282
I love the opinions.

519
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:25,368
But no one can judge them.

520
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:26,953
If you like the person, what will you do?

521
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:27,954
I wouldn't be like this.

522
00:21:27,954 --> 00:21:30,331
But we can't mistake
opinion for judgment.

523
00:21:30,331 --> 00:21:31,666
An opinion is like an ass,

524
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:32,917
everyone has one.

525
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,419
No, but I understood what Bia said.

526
00:21:34,419 --> 00:21:37,213
We can't give an opinion...

527
00:21:37,213 --> 00:21:38,715
From what I've been watching,

528
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:40,883
it's bad for both of them.

529
00:21:40,883 --> 00:21:41,843
I think it's interesting to see.

530
00:21:41,843 --> 00:21:43,136
They are pretending...

531
00:21:43,136 --> 00:21:45,471
...they're both doing things
to hurt each other.

532
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:47,056
It's bad, but the desire is rising.

533
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:50,476
Yeah... I've already done this a lot.

534
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:58,317
I used to say men are fragile.
We know that, but fuck...

535
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,777
I didn't know it was like that.

536
00:21:59,777 --> 00:22:01,863
- No, guys...
- Fucking sensitive.

537
00:22:01,863 --> 00:22:04,032
No... It's all wrong.

538
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,616
- I swear...
- It's all wrong.

539
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:08,953
Again, girls proved they're badasses.

540
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:11,414
And men are useless.

541
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:15,251
Yesterday what happened to Murilo
was beautiful. One day I cried,

542
00:22:15,251 --> 00:22:18,129
the other day, he was pissed.

543
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:22,091
Everything that goes around
comes around, honey.

544
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:24,927
Grandma used to say,
"Men are only good for sex,

545
00:22:24,927 --> 00:22:27,889
then you walk away."

546
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:31,059
I already said, "Use their body
and toss them away."

547
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,353
Hit pause right now. Look...

548
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,105
"Grandma used to say."
Is her grandma named Kátia?

549
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:37,315
Is it fair to hear...

550
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:38,858
If a woman says something like this,

551
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:40,693
and a guy says this thing about a woman...

552
00:22:40,693 --> 00:22:42,028
What did she say?

553
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:44,155
...aren't we trying to fight for equality?

554
00:22:44,155 --> 00:22:45,281
Don't compare this to that.

555
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,366
- Did she lie?
- I'll tell you something.

556
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:49,535
That woman saying to the whole world...

557
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:53,081
Because this is streaming, right?
The whole world can watch this.

558
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:54,832
And she saying, "Grandma used to say...

559
00:22:54,832 --> 00:22:56,334
'Men are only good for...'"

560
00:22:56,334 --> 00:22:59,337
Hi, guys.
"Only good for sex, then you walk away."

561
00:22:59,337 --> 00:23:00,922
Imagine a guy saying this about a woman?

562
00:23:00,922 --> 00:23:02,757
They are people.
She's talking about...

563
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:04,967
Let's not treat this generically...

564
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,427
I'm already bored. Look...

565
00:23:06,427 --> 00:23:08,054
...this is about her.

566
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:09,972
You're saying
women talk about men.

567
00:23:09,972 --> 00:23:12,266
I made a mistake. I don't like it.

568
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,602
But a man could've said that, too, Felipe.

569
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:16,979
- Men really say this.
- That's why I don't...

570
00:23:16,979 --> 00:23:18,481
...judge men or women.

571
00:23:18,606 --> 00:23:21,234
Do you think men don't say that?

572
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:23,069
- Like that?
- Yes...

573
00:23:23,069 --> 00:23:25,071
"Women are only good for sex,
then you walk away"?

574
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:26,239
I know lots of them who say it.

575
00:23:26,239 --> 00:23:27,740
Men and women, both of them say it.

576
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,325
Do you think they don't do this here?

577
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:31,119
No, tell me if I'm wrong.

578
00:23:31,244 --> 00:23:32,829
If a man says that,
it'll be a mess.

579
00:23:32,829 --> 00:23:34,580
- Of course they say it.
- I also...

580
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,332
There are men who say it.

581
00:23:36,332 --> 00:23:38,960
I don't have friends
who say something like this.

582
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,045
"Women are only good for sex,
then you walk away."

583
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:42,797
- No...
- Titto, go to church.

584
00:23:42,797 --> 00:23:44,632
Really... You're a wonderful woman.

585
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:47,844
- Do you think?
- No, I'm sure, bro.

586
00:23:47,844 --> 00:23:49,262
- Sweet-talker.
- No, I promise you.

587
00:23:49,262 --> 00:23:51,305
Fuck the rest.

588
00:24:01,107 --> 00:24:04,026
Hey, mister...
Why do you have a girlfriend?

589
00:24:04,026 --> 00:24:05,736
I'm dying to kiss you.

590
00:24:05,736 --> 00:24:07,238
- Really?
- I swear.

591
00:24:07,238 --> 00:24:09,240
That's okay, I respect that.

592
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,534
Not even a little kiss?

593
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,120
I wanna kiss you pretty bad.

594
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,830
She was rejected pretty bad.

595
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:19,083
Jeez, bro! I can't believe it, man.

596
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:20,710
Was she rejected?

597
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:22,503
I missed it, I'm careless. Stop...

598
00:24:22,503 --> 00:24:24,213
I have a moon in Pisces.

599
00:24:24,213 --> 00:24:26,299
And she hooked up with another one.

600
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:27,925
She's doing that to tease that guy...

601
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:30,845
- That's what I'm saying.
- He's also doing that to tease her.

602
00:24:30,845 --> 00:24:32,930
It's okay. He did that to tease her.

603
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:34,432
You have to listen to me.

604
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:35,808
She's hitting on those guys.

605
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:37,518
Fuck, that's bad, man.

606
00:24:37,518 --> 00:24:38,519
No, he also hooked up with...

607
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,520
...to get rejected?

608
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:40,771
For no reason? That's nonsense.

609
00:24:40,771 --> 00:24:41,731
But if he was rejected,

610
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:43,524
the situation would be the same.

611
00:24:43,524 --> 00:24:45,234
- That's lame, right?
- Don't judge.

612
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:49,655
Those two are in the same situation.
They are in love, love is beautiful.

613
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:53,075
That chick was pretending to be
unattached... Don't do that.

614
00:24:53,075 --> 00:24:54,327
Do you know what I think?

615
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:56,996
This show will end, and they
will be together forever.

616
00:24:56,996 --> 00:24:58,039
I think so, too.

617
00:24:58,039 --> 00:25:00,333
- Why don't they enjoy that?
- When this show ends...

618
00:25:00,333 --> 00:25:02,877
Are they together? That's what I asked.

619
00:25:02,877 --> 00:25:04,962
His Instagram profile was not provided.

620
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:07,006
They're not together. I'm kidding.

621
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,257
- But he kissed...
- I think...

622
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:11,010
- Let's go to the after party, then?
- Is it gonna be nice?

623
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:13,679
No, but are you a good cook?
Because we are starving...

624
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,389
- Let me tell you...
- Look...

625
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:18,267
Is there a private room
for me and her to get some sleep?

626
00:25:18,267 --> 00:25:19,435
You can sleep there...

627
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:24,023
- He wants to tease.
- Murilo's gonna hook up with two girls,

628
00:25:24,023 --> 00:25:27,902
and Taynara looks like she's upset,
but she's confident.

629
00:25:34,325 --> 00:25:35,701
João also took her home.

630
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,704
- I wonder if now is the time.
- It's today.

631
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:39,622
Place your bets.

632
00:25:39,747 --> 00:25:41,290
Guys, I want to see it.

633
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,375
Is it now?

634
00:25:42,375 --> 00:25:43,501
What will he come up with?

635
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:47,213
Show her my closet.
She wants some shorts.

636
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,216
-"Please."
-"Please."

637
00:25:50,841 --> 00:25:52,510
- What is your name?
- Evelin.

638
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:53,511
Right. I remember.

639
00:25:53,511 --> 00:25:55,137
That girl has a skin chafing.

640
00:25:55,638 --> 00:25:57,306
Does Beatriz have chafing
or is she limping?

641
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,392
I get like this after Carnival.

642
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:02,186
- Will they play?
- They won't.

643
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:04,939
- They will play rock, paper, scissors.
- João is taking her to the room.

644
00:26:04,939 --> 00:26:06,983
João is going to the room with that girl.

645
00:26:06,983 --> 00:26:08,776
I can't believe João's gonna have sex.

646
00:26:08,776 --> 00:26:09,986
I can't believe it.

647
00:26:09,986 --> 00:26:11,862
What if he has a small dick?

648
00:26:13,281 --> 00:26:14,907
- You won't see it.
- They went in so...

649
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,409
It's time to have sex.

650
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:18,786
No, but you saw that
"the makeup is here, look."

651
00:26:18,786 --> 00:26:20,037
It's time for sex.

652
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:21,872
I wonder if...

653
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:22,999
What did she say?

654
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:26,585
That he wants to hook up with her.

655
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,171
I wonder if João is going to
lose his virginity.

656
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:32,800
Jeez, Virgin João.

657
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:36,429
He's going to lose his virginity.

658
00:26:38,306 --> 00:26:40,725
- Yeah, I find it very ugly...
- Jeez, man...

659
00:26:43,227 --> 00:26:46,355
It looks like...

660
00:26:46,647 --> 00:26:48,899
There's a weird mood there.

661
00:26:48,899 --> 00:26:50,860
Those girls are making a mess.

662
00:26:53,696 --> 00:26:55,698
- It's not João!
- It's João.

663
00:26:55,698 --> 00:26:58,409
- It can't be...
- It hasn't begun yet.

664
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:02,121
If there's no explicit scene for João,
I'll leave now.

665
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:03,831
I don't think so...

666
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:06,459
Guys, are they eating?

667
00:27:07,251 --> 00:27:10,963
Look how Tay looked
at those girls. Blazing.

668
00:27:11,797 --> 00:27:13,841
I found my flip-flops.

669
00:27:15,301 --> 00:27:17,803
I love it. Oh, my God,
looks like a soap opera scene!

670
00:27:18,846 --> 00:27:19,889
It's really like a soap opera.

671
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:23,392
Can you take those flip-flops off, please?

672
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:25,353
"Sure, honey."

673
00:27:27,897 --> 00:27:29,523
- Jeez...
- She's upset...

674
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:31,692
- Would you ask your flip-flops back?
- I wouldn't!

675
00:27:32,943 --> 00:27:35,112
- Sure, honey.
- Sure, baby.

676
00:27:35,112 --> 00:27:36,530
Will you eat this much?

677
00:27:37,073 --> 00:27:38,532
- It looks like...
- If she was phonier,

678
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:39,784
she'd be awarded a prize.

679
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:42,161
What? If I was phonier,
I'd be awarded a prize?

680
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:44,330
- What?
- You said that.

681
00:27:44,330 --> 00:27:46,874
- Phony what? I didn't get it.
- I said...

682
00:27:46,874 --> 00:27:47,792
I was the one who said it.

683
00:27:47,792 --> 00:27:49,293
...she'd be awarded a prize."

684
00:27:49,293 --> 00:27:50,211
Why did you say this?

685
00:27:50,211 --> 00:27:52,213
Because she said, "Bye..."

686
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:53,589
Do you know what I'd say?

687
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:54,799
I'd say to her,

688
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:57,343
"He's just hooking up with you,
brought you two here because of me.

689
00:27:57,885 --> 00:27:58,719
Would you say that to her?

690
00:27:58,719 --> 00:27:59,637
"Because he loves me."

691
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:01,263
...that would be too low.

692
00:28:01,263 --> 00:28:03,891
But that would be too low,
and I'd show him I care.

693
00:28:04,058 --> 00:28:05,976
Thank God, Lord.

694
00:28:05,976 --> 00:28:07,895
It's been a week, he was in need.

695
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:10,314
It's been more than that.

696
00:28:10,314 --> 00:28:13,150
Because he came back
from Amazonas and came straight here.

697
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:14,485
In Amazonas,
he didn't do anything.

698
00:28:15,403 --> 00:28:16,737
He was there for a month.

699
00:28:17,405 --> 00:28:19,281
Shit, women in Amazonas are hot.

700
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:21,700
Put some clothes on.

701
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,244
He nailed it!

702
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:25,329
This is talent.

703
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:26,914
If you work a little bit, it may work.

704
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:29,166
Stop it, let me see if it worked.

705
00:28:29,166 --> 00:28:31,127
Let me see.

706
00:28:31,127 --> 00:28:32,753
Oh, yeah!

707
00:28:32,753 --> 00:28:35,005
He got out of the room
celebrating in front of her.

708
00:28:35,005 --> 00:28:37,007
- That's fucked up.
- Fuck, what a shame.

709
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:39,385
That's fucked up.

710
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:40,719
"Guys, I had sex, look!"

711
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:43,514
Yeah, that's a dickhead, bro, really.

712
00:28:43,514 --> 00:28:45,975
But at least I won that bet
since João had sex.

713
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:48,185
João had sex!

714
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:50,604
Do you remember
who bet he was gonna have...

715
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:52,523
I bet he wouldn't.
I lost the bet.

716
00:28:52,523 --> 00:28:54,650
I know, you have to pay me.

717
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,068
- You're crazy.
- Come here.

718
00:28:56,068 --> 00:28:57,403
What?

719
00:28:58,279 --> 00:28:59,655
She said, "What?"

720
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:00,948
'Cause I already turned.

721
00:29:00,948 --> 00:29:02,366
What?

722
00:29:05,870 --> 00:29:08,122
Bye. Good night. God bless you.

723
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:12,293
It was very good to see you. Sorry.

724
00:29:12,293 --> 00:29:13,335
No problem.

725
00:29:13,335 --> 00:29:16,088
- See you tomorrow?
- See you. Let's stay in touch.

726
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:28,100
Imagine those chicks leaving 300,
which is in Jurerê,

727
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:31,645
and taking the car to get to Lagoa
to be with that guy in that house.

728
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:33,063
Then she arrived there,

729
00:29:33,063 --> 00:29:35,983
took those flip-flops, and they weren't...

730
00:29:35,983 --> 00:29:37,776
She ate, changed her clothes again...

731
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:39,570
It's going to take an hour to come back...

732
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:40,529
Go fuck...

733
00:29:40,529 --> 00:29:43,157
Baby, she ate for free
and got a ride home.

734
00:29:43,157 --> 00:29:44,909
- She took a cab.
- Then it's all right.

735
00:29:44,909 --> 00:29:46,952
Thinking about this, in the beginning...

736
00:29:46,952 --> 00:29:48,496
One salad is worth an hour by car.

737
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:49,580
What a shame, man.

738
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:51,624
She went to have dinner with her friends.

739
00:29:51,624 --> 00:29:54,043
That's part of... Anything goes.

740
00:29:54,043 --> 00:29:56,212
She was humiliated there.

741
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:57,713
She wasn't humiliated.

742
00:29:57,713 --> 00:30:00,549
I'm not gonna be
able to sleep till next week.

743
00:30:00,549 --> 00:30:01,675
I wanna watch this now.

744
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:03,052
I'm very anxious.

745
00:30:03,052 --> 00:30:04,011
It could be now.

746
00:30:04,512 --> 00:30:06,639
Bia, are you anxious?

747
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:08,390
I think Tay is gonna marry Murilo.

748
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,392
Me, too. I'm gonna have to have...

749
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:14,355
You're crazy, especially now
with this in trouble.

750
00:30:14,355 --> 00:30:15,814
It's gonna be here, in your house.

751
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:16,815
ON THE NEXT EPISODE

752
00:30:16,815 --> 00:30:18,317
Why are you looking at her this way?

753
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:21,403
If a friend of mine talks like this,

754
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:23,405
"So-and-so slapped me."
What am I going to think?

755
00:30:23,405 --> 00:30:24,406
That he slapped her face.

756
00:30:24,406 --> 00:30:25,491
I would go talk to the guy.

757
00:30:25,491 --> 00:30:28,285
"Are you going to slap her face?
Are you nuts?"
