1
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:17,268
I'm super excited about today.

2
00:00:17,268 --> 00:00:19,103
Yeah, me, too!

3
00:00:19,103 --> 00:00:20,730
For Christ's sake!

4
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,857
So, guys, how are you?

5
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:23,899
Have you seen Carol?

6
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:25,025
Is Carol coming?

7
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:26,610
- Right here.
- What's up, guys?

8
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,945
What's happening, sis?

9
00:00:27,945 --> 00:00:28,863
Hey, hi!

10
00:00:28,863 --> 00:00:31,574
I wonder if they'll argue
and kiss a lot today.

11
00:00:31,574 --> 00:00:33,325
- I think so.
- I'm scared, you know?

12
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:36,245
I'm checking out Pabllo's look.
Look at those boots.

13
00:00:36,245 --> 00:00:37,788
I'm shocked.

14
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,457
The size of the skirt is still worse.

15
00:00:39,457 --> 00:00:41,375
Let me take a look. Hi! How are you?

16
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,627
Look! What the hell? You're slutty.

17
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:44,837
That's perfect.

18
00:00:45,004 --> 00:00:47,131
Her butt is saying, "Hi, how are you?"

19
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:49,925
Are you ready to start this thing?
I'm very excited.

20
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:50,843
I'm nervous.

21
00:00:50,843 --> 00:00:52,678
I'm anxious to see
what happens next.

22
00:00:52,803 --> 00:00:53,971
I want to see a fight.

23
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:56,348
Is everybody ready for the second episode?

24
00:00:56,348 --> 00:00:57,683
Let's do it.

25
00:00:57,683 --> 00:00:59,435
- Wild and Free: Florianópolis.
- I can't wait.

26
00:00:59,435 --> 00:01:01,187
A lot has happened, right?

27
00:01:01,187 --> 00:01:03,981
Bia had an argument with Luan...
Luan slept on the couch...

28
00:01:03,981 --> 00:01:05,191
Nothing but trouble.

29
00:01:05,191 --> 00:01:06,734
It's a circus. I'm shocked.

30
00:01:06,734 --> 00:01:09,528
I was shipping this couple
and now I'm un-shipping them.

31
00:01:09,528 --> 00:01:13,616
Then they had a falling out. Remember,
it's eight friends on vacation in Floripa.

32
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:15,201
No actors, no script, nothing.

33
00:01:15,201 --> 00:01:16,869
We can't just start shipping.
Let's watch this episode.

34
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:19,371
We wouldn't know...
There's no telling now.

35
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:20,748
Let's watch it.

36
00:01:20,748 --> 00:01:22,792
- Hit that play.
- Hit that play, Bia.

37
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:24,877
- Wow, Bia!
- I love that play.

38
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:56,867
WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS

39
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,490
Fuck.

40
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:53,090
Shit, man, it's freaking cold.

41
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:12,818
Shit, bro! Nice and cool, huh?

42
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:14,612
Nice.

43
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:33,213
This is great. You know, when you're
feeling... unbalanced, kind of weird?

44
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,131
Yeah, me, too.

45
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,633
Just breathe, man.

46
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:38,302
Breathe, look at the sun, feel it...
Feel the grass.

47
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:39,887
You know that thing I said?

48
00:03:39,887 --> 00:03:43,849
I wasn't telling the truth.
I was pissed...

49
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:48,228
Not so much for Ramon,
but for Bia, you know?

50
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:50,314
I was pissed.

51
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:57,905
I know, it sucks. I know what you mean.

52
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:00,324
I don't let stuff get to me, though.

53
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:02,660
Me neither. I'm going on "fuck you" mode.

54
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,703
Exactly.

55
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:06,497
At least I'm going to try.

56
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:10,084
Why are you here?
You're here to have a good time.

57
00:04:23,138 --> 00:04:28,852
Nath has this look in her eyes,
kind of... It's not very sexy.

58
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,104
I passed out, too.

59
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,690
Remember when you fell down?

60
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,775
Remember when you grabbed me
when I was with that girl?

61
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:36,026
You grabbed him good.

62
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,529
She didn't cry for me either, right?
Just like...

63
00:04:38,529 --> 00:04:41,365
Man! No... I didn't cry for him.

64
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:45,786
Of course you didn't.
Nobody saw that last night.

65
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,342
Did you sleep well?

66
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:03,262
I fell asleep snuggling...
with Nath and Bia.

67
00:05:03,262 --> 00:05:04,513
And I slept well. Alone.

68
00:05:04,513 --> 00:05:07,683
I saw that. I woke up to go
to the bathroom and saw you alone.

69
00:05:07,683 --> 00:05:11,270
I couldn't resist.
I came over to give you a kiss.

70
00:05:18,235 --> 00:05:20,404
You really thought
I was hooking up with Luan?

71
00:05:20,404 --> 00:05:21,739
I still think you're gonna.

72
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:22,656
No, I'm not.

73
00:05:22,656 --> 00:05:26,827
Of course you are. This is a free country.
You can do whatever you want.

74
00:05:26,952 --> 00:05:28,454
- Exactly.
- So... but...

75
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:31,540
You didn't have to act
like that yesterday.

76
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:33,333
I was upset with you and, like...

77
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,252
I'm not upset with you or him, right?

78
00:05:35,252 --> 00:05:37,463
- With me? I didn't do anything.
- Right...

79
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:44,261
Pass the olive oil, please?
We should wait for the girls, right?

80
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:45,471
Oh, man. I'm starving.

81
00:05:45,471 --> 00:05:48,223
I'm not in a good mood, okay?
Wait? You should start.

82
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:50,309
- What?
- I think you can start eating.

83
00:05:50,309 --> 00:05:51,602
Good, let's eat, then.

84
00:05:51,602 --> 00:05:54,980
I wanted to talk to you guys.
Sorry I was rude with last night.

85
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,231
I was... Shit...

86
00:05:56,231 --> 00:05:57,733
You were angry, bro. The booze...

87
00:05:57,733 --> 00:05:59,526
I can't accept some stuff.

88
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,987
I was chilling, minding
my own business, man.

89
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:04,073
You're pointing a finger at me...

90
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:05,365
Be yourself.

91
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,700
You're being fake.

92
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,327
But I am being myself.

93
00:06:08,327 --> 00:06:10,245
Oh, yeah? Fine. Be yourself.

94
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:12,998
I think it's nice to admit what you did.
That's it.

95
00:06:12,998 --> 00:06:13,957
Life goes on.

96
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:15,667
I'm sorry, I was rude to you guys.

97
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:17,836
Man, just be who you are, seriously.

98
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:20,547
One thing I don't like is
talking about what I did.

99
00:06:20,547 --> 00:06:24,259
I don't like gossip. I was helping
someone and, like... Forget it.

100
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:25,636
Forget it, no worries.

101
00:06:25,761 --> 00:06:28,263
Sorry. I slept alone,
didn't have breakfast with you.

102
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:29,181
I'm not staying in this vibe.

103
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:30,265
Keep that vibe.

104
00:06:30,265 --> 00:06:31,183
Forget it.

105
00:06:31,183 --> 00:06:33,102
I like seeing you like that.

106
00:06:33,102 --> 00:06:35,187
You dog!

107
00:06:35,187 --> 00:06:36,271
Keep that vibe.

108
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:37,523
- Thank you.
- All good.

109
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:38,732
You've got a great vibe.

110
00:06:38,732 --> 00:06:41,235
We're here for each other,
for one another, bro.

111
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:42,402
It happened.

112
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,488
You've slept it off,
woke up feeling better. Relax.

113
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:46,073
I'm apologizing to the girls, too.

114
00:06:46,073 --> 00:06:46,990
You are awesome.

115
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,367
Yeah, man, way to go.

116
00:06:48,534 --> 00:06:49,785
It's all good.

117
00:06:49,785 --> 00:06:52,371
Seriously, you should have
a chat with Bia, man.

118
00:06:53,372 --> 00:06:55,165
If you have to break up, no problem.

119
00:06:55,165 --> 00:06:57,918
But the friendship
and love for you all will stay,

120
00:06:57,918 --> 00:06:59,711
and I want it to grow positively.

121
00:06:59,711 --> 00:07:00,796
Of course.

122
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:02,464
That's what it's all about, man.

123
00:07:02,464 --> 00:07:03,924
That's obvious.

124
00:07:03,924 --> 00:07:09,680
You guys keep fighting,
but the initial problem is still there.

125
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,600
You don't solve it, you get drama
all over again, like yesterday.

126
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,018
I was talking to the guys...

127
00:07:15,018 --> 00:07:16,103
It's freaking cold.

128
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:17,563
Bia, I was talking to them,

129
00:07:17,563 --> 00:07:18,814
apologizing for my behavior.

130
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:21,233
I was out of line with you, too.
I'm sorry.

131
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:24,236
Let me give you a hug.
I want us to be good.

132
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:27,322
Just like a family.
No hard feelings. Nice!

133
00:07:27,322 --> 00:07:29,992
Way to go.

134
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:31,952
Are you apologizing, too?

135
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,246
I'm sorry, too, for everything.

136
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,711
Can we kiss already?

137
00:07:42,379 --> 00:07:43,505
This is good food.

138
00:07:43,505 --> 00:07:45,340
Isn't it? Guys, I can't eat it all.

139
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:47,426
- I can.
- No, I'm like dynamite.

140
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:49,595
Come on, then. Let's do it.

141
00:07:50,012 --> 00:07:51,597
Slow down, I'm eating it.

142
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:52,514
I called dibs.

143
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:54,016
Are you having problems?

144
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:55,893
Not me.

145
00:07:56,268 --> 00:07:57,644
It's all falling down.

146
00:08:23,629 --> 00:08:25,631
Is it possible?
Are we going on a boat?

147
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:26,757
I can't believe it.

148
00:08:26,757 --> 00:08:27,841
Crazy, man.

149
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,801
For real?

150
00:08:38,227 --> 00:08:39,603
- Look at that.
- Hi!

151
00:08:39,603 --> 00:08:40,646
Hi, guys, how are you?

152
00:08:40,646 --> 00:08:42,397
Hey! We're fine. All good?

153
00:08:42,898 --> 00:08:43,899
What's up? Good morning.

154
00:08:44,107 --> 00:08:46,443
- Doing good?
- Right. How are you guys?

155
00:08:46,818 --> 00:08:47,819
Just fine.

156
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:48,904
Excited.

157
00:08:50,405 --> 00:08:51,657
I'm Ricardo, your bar manager.

158
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:52,741
RICARDO
BAR MANAGER

159
00:08:52,741 --> 00:08:53,659
- Perfect.
- Great.

160
00:08:53,659 --> 00:08:55,244
Today, I'll show you the place.

161
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:56,536
Fun!

162
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,956
I'd like you to see it.
I have a boat for us.

163
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,251
I already like the boss.

164
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:03,961
- Awesome!
- Can we go now?

165
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:05,879
- What a job!
- Now!

166
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,464
- All right.
- Wonderful.

167
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,174
- Can we drink on the job?
- Can we?

168
00:09:09,174 --> 00:09:11,969
We'll talk about it later.
Let's go to the boat.

169
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:14,137
- Come on!
- Come on!

170
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,639
Crazy good, man.

171
00:09:20,185 --> 00:09:21,228
Let's go!

172
00:09:44,793 --> 00:09:47,337
Guys, let's go to the bar. Easy now.

173
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:49,256
- Okay.
- On the sand, over there.

174
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:53,552
Look at this. Gosh, I don't want to work.
I want booze, please.

175
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,429
Yeah, it's all right.

176
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:56,680
Oops. We can't.

177
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,764
Go to work!

178
00:09:58,807 --> 00:09:59,891
I forgot.

179
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:03,895
Well, guys. I wanted
to talk about your tasks here.

180
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:04,938
Shoot.

181
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:07,816
Waiting tables
and preparing drinks at the bar.

182
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:14,406
This job is what's going
to pay for your parties.

183
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,700
- That's what we need right now.
- Yes!

184
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,784
Right now.

185
00:10:17,784 --> 00:10:18,910
But today...

186
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:20,037
It's expensive...

187
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:22,372
...is the only day you get
to enjoy the place.

188
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:26,543
Today, I'm paying the tab. It's all free.

189
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:31,923
- I think I'm going to cry.
- Fuck!

190
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,178
But we can't get in trouble, right?

191
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:41,808
We're going to drink today, shit!

192
00:10:44,686 --> 00:10:46,563
Welcome, thank you.

193
00:10:46,563 --> 00:10:47,773
Thank you.

194
00:10:57,949 --> 00:10:59,284
I want to talk to you.

195
00:10:59,284 --> 00:11:02,037
I like being with you,
get to know you better.

196
00:11:02,037 --> 00:11:05,665
We had something good going on.
Somehow, we went from heaven to hell in...

197
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:06,750
In a second.

198
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,628
Are we going to be
doing that all the time?

199
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:11,671
We talked about it, but it happened.

200
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:16,385
I need more than that, you know?
Because I'm going to end up getting hurt.

201
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:21,556
I only asked to be respected, got it?
I really...

202
00:11:21,556 --> 00:11:25,727
I just want to enjoy myself.
I just want to be happy, you know?

203
00:11:25,852 --> 00:11:26,686
You wanna hook up with her?

204
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,105
Go ahead, I'm cool.

205
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:30,816
When you make out with her, I'd rather...

206
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:32,859
Are you jealous?

207
00:11:37,447 --> 00:11:38,573
Yes.

208
00:11:38,573 --> 00:11:40,826
Why are you jealous?

209
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:42,411
Don't know.
Trying to understand.

210
00:11:42,411 --> 00:11:44,329
Do you like me?

211
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:47,290
Yes, I do. I told you that.

212
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:49,584
I'm not easy to get, you know?

213
00:11:49,793 --> 00:11:54,297
Cheers, then. Are we good?
Are you going to be all right?

214
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:57,926
Yes, we're good.

215
00:11:57,926 --> 00:11:59,344
What do you want to do?

216
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:02,013
I want to enjoy,
I want to party, go crazy.

217
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,852
One more shot, please.

218
00:12:11,148 --> 00:12:14,860
How's it going? Good? No?

219
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,528
I actually like the one

220
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:17,904
in the jeans.

221
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:18,989
The one sitting down?

222
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:20,574
Standing up, jeans and glasses.

223
00:12:20,574 --> 00:12:22,409
But I'm sure he's got a girlfriend.

224
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,994
No, but...

225
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:26,121
He's hot. Very handsome.

226
00:12:26,121 --> 00:12:28,707
If I get him here, would you kiss him?
Out of the blue?

227
00:12:28,707 --> 00:12:30,041
In a heartbeat, brother.

228
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:39,217
Hey, what's up, bro? Man, there's a chick
over there, she's hot... She's with us.

229
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:43,054
She kind of likes you.
I asked her if... She said,

230
00:12:43,054 --> 00:12:46,516
"He doesn't need to... He's hot,
no need to ask. Just kiss me."

231
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:48,894
Look, it's the blonde in white pants.

232
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:49,978
Oh, yeah?

233
00:12:50,395 --> 00:12:51,897
- Are you in?
- Let's go.

234
00:12:51,897 --> 00:12:54,733
I'll go with you.

235
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:58,195
Come with me. Go ahead.

236
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,199
Look how gorgeous he is, man.

237
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:03,283
You said it.

238
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:08,622
Man! She's a fucking hurricane!

239
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:11,249
Wow, man! I told you!

240
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:16,421
What's going on here? I can't believe it.

241
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:18,340
Now you can get to know each other.

242
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,759
I can't believe it.
I have to kiss you, man.

243
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,761
Today's the day.

244
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:26,932
Blondie! Oh, my God!
I can't believe my eyes. Fuck!

245
00:13:30,894 --> 00:13:33,605
You're welcome?

246
00:13:33,855 --> 00:13:34,856
I love you.

247
00:13:35,065 --> 00:13:36,066
There, there.

248
00:13:36,066 --> 00:13:37,734
Enough already. You guys go chat.

249
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,778
- What's your name?
- Thais, pleased to meet you.

250
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:40,737
She's shaking all over.

251
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:42,572
Blondie is fast.

252
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,925
Come on. Let's go talk over there.

253
00:14:01,925 --> 00:14:03,009
I'm in the middle of a game.

254
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,971
No, you're not. Come on.

255
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:08,056
Okay. I'll be right back.

256
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,891
Come on, give me your hand.

257
00:14:12,143 --> 00:14:15,855
I'm sorry about ruining your game.
I hope it was for a good cause.

258
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:16,773
I hope so, too.

259
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,858
Yeah? Let's find out.
What do you think?

260
00:14:19,317 --> 00:14:21,444
I'm thinking about the game.
I like to play.

261
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,154
You're here thinking...

262
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:24,489
- Do you play pool?
- Yes, at home.

263
00:14:24,489 --> 00:14:25,657
Let's play, then.

264
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:27,617
- Okay. But can we kiss beforehand?
- No.

265
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:30,328
That's not fun. So, if I win...
I'm... We'll kiss.

266
00:14:30,328 --> 00:14:31,246
You win, we kiss.

267
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:32,330
A little kiss.

268
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:35,709
If I win the game of pool, we'll kiss.

269
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:40,380
Whoa! What if you lose?

270
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,132
If you lose, you shut up.

271
00:14:51,683 --> 00:14:54,185
There's no cue and there's no chalk, shit!

272
00:14:54,728 --> 00:14:56,563
Are you scared already? Go on!

273
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,981
If she beats him...

274
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,275
- What does this look like?
- I'm cold.

275
00:15:00,275 --> 00:15:01,735
You, of all people?

276
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:07,073
Are you going to play games with me now?

277
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:08,283
This is no game.

278
00:15:08,283 --> 00:15:09,826
If you don't want it,
I'll stop coming on to you.

279
00:15:09,826 --> 00:15:11,036
No, I do want it.

280
00:15:11,036 --> 00:15:12,704
- Do you?
- I do.

281
00:15:12,704 --> 00:15:13,788
No...

282
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:16,541
But... I don't want to be an idiot.

283
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:38,855
You got this, man.

284
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:44,194
Go, João!

285
00:15:44,194 --> 00:15:45,862
João!

286
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,406
Tay, what do you think of all this?

287
00:15:56,122 --> 00:16:00,126
João!

288
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:02,879
Now kiss him.

289
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:15,100
Thank you, my fans, for rooting for me.
Let's go to the after, all right?

290
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:21,398
Today, we're going to party hard.

291
00:16:21,731 --> 00:16:23,358
Someone stop me.

292
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:27,946
You've got to drink it all.

293
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:33,535
Tonight the room upstairs is mine.

294
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,120
Blondie called dibs on it.

295
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,205
It's mine! But we can share it.

296
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:40,208
Let's do it. It's going to be beautiful.
The four of us.

297
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,584
- An orgy?
- Yeah.

298
00:17:01,813 --> 00:17:02,647
Shit, let's go home.

299
00:17:02,647 --> 00:17:06,192
Let's go, girls. I can't wait.

300
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:13,116
To the right... Here. Get that seat right.

301
00:17:13,116 --> 00:17:15,368
Holy crap, you're fast.

302
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,870
Come on.

303
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,085
I'm going to ask him to be my boyfriend.

304
00:17:24,085 --> 00:17:27,464
Shit, did I just hear that?
Are you sure?

305
00:17:27,464 --> 00:17:30,216
- I'm going to ask him to be my boyfriend.
- You are a couple now?

306
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,301
My love.

307
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:50,612
Let's go. Go!

308
00:17:59,287 --> 00:18:02,373
Don't go kissing yet.
Get the cachaça first.

309
00:18:02,707 --> 00:18:04,584
Holy shit, what a mouth.

310
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:10,548
Give it to the monster.
Chug it down, Jack Sparrow.

311
00:18:13,092 --> 00:18:15,053
Holy crap. This is fucking strong.

312
00:18:16,012 --> 00:18:19,015
Drink it and go upstairs,
I'm going to get you good.

313
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:21,851
Hey, you guys.

314
00:18:21,851 --> 00:18:24,938
Hey. Welcome, feel at home, okay?
And there's food.

315
00:18:24,938 --> 00:18:27,023
- João?
- What is it, bro?

316
00:18:28,817 --> 00:18:29,943
Where's Ramon?

317
00:18:29,943 --> 00:18:31,736
Introduce your wife to them.

318
00:18:32,362 --> 00:18:33,988
- To whom?
- To whom?

319
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:35,073
To the bedroom...

320
00:18:35,073 --> 00:18:36,908
Come here,
I want to show you my girlfriend.

321
00:18:36,908 --> 00:18:38,159
Oh, shit.

322
00:18:38,159 --> 00:18:39,160
True...

323
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,662
Joyce, I'm coming.

324
00:18:42,038 --> 00:18:43,540
Here, look! Here.

325
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,917
Someone get a pizza, please?

326
00:18:45,917 --> 00:18:47,919
I can't believe it.

327
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,003
You're not jealous, are you?

328
00:18:49,504 --> 00:18:50,338
It's Joyce.

329
00:18:50,338 --> 00:18:52,215
He doesn't hook up with anyone.

330
00:18:52,215 --> 00:18:53,341
Only Joyce.

331
00:18:54,968 --> 00:18:55,802
Man...

332
00:18:55,802 --> 00:18:56,761
Joyce...

333
00:18:56,761 --> 00:18:59,222
Put her in the bathroom, right here.

334
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:00,181
She killed Joyce.

335
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:03,017
Poor Joyce. Joyce, don't be upset.

336
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,144
Don't be upset.
Turn around, Joyce.

337
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,229
She'll turn around...

338
00:19:06,229 --> 00:19:08,273
She's facing the wall,
she won't see it.

339
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:10,358
I'm going to apply concealer on Joyce.

340
00:19:12,944 --> 00:19:15,154
Man, you're funny.

341
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:19,367
It's just that... Look,
I think I deserve more than she does.

342
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:21,703
Goodbye, Joyce Kelly.

343
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:44,767
I'm going to eat a lot of fucking pizza.
I bet nobody here can eat a raw egg.

344
00:19:44,767 --> 00:19:47,228
- No.
- I have never eaten a raw egg.

345
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:48,479
I don't want one.

346
00:19:48,479 --> 00:19:50,023
I bet nobody will eat it.

347
00:19:50,023 --> 00:19:51,357
If you eat

348
00:19:51,357 --> 00:19:52,275
a raw egg...

349
00:19:52,275 --> 00:19:53,860
She'll eat your ass.

350
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,070
Yeah!

351
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,196
Holy crap!

352
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:58,698
She's game.

353
00:19:58,698 --> 00:20:01,409
Daddy will take the bet
because he can't take the pressure.

354
00:20:01,409 --> 00:20:02,493
She's game.

355
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,790
You're screwed.

356
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,753
Man, he really ate the raw egg. Fuck!

357
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:13,880
Wow, he really did.

358
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,843
She's going to sleep here.

359
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,637
She's kissing with the egg...

360
00:20:21,012 --> 00:20:23,389
Wait, I'm going to burp a chick.

361
00:20:38,738 --> 00:20:43,868
Listen, here's the thing.
I don't want to fuck you anymore.

362
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:47,205
I want to hang out with you.
I want to be...

363
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:49,040
I don't want to fuck in the living room.

364
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,043
Please, that's all I ask.

365
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:54,879
No, João.

366
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:55,880
All right.

367
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:58,675
Then, stop talking, man.
Look at those two over there.

368
00:20:58,675 --> 00:21:00,677
They're idiots. I'm talking to you.

369
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:02,553
Is anyone there with you?

370
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:04,222
Can you see them gossiping?

371
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:05,390
Gossiping, man?

372
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,266
Are they going to have sex?

373
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:08,518
It's their problem...

374
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:13,147
They're not enjoying.
Brother, stay strong.

375
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:15,108
Stop! Hey... No!

376
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:21,489
It's okay.

377
00:21:23,866 --> 00:21:28,037
Stay cool. Son of a bitch.

378
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,249
The chick eats raw egg, man.

379
00:21:31,249 --> 00:21:36,629
I drank egg, man, all right? Screw you.

380
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:39,007
I love this house.

381
00:21:39,007 --> 00:21:40,174
I'm glad that...

382
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:43,386
I just wanted to talk to you, man.
Maybe hang out, that's all.

383
00:21:43,386 --> 00:21:44,721
Why can't you talk right here?

384
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:48,099
I don't want to talk in front
of everybody. I want it in private.

385
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:53,187
You never thought
you were going to meet me.

386
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:57,900
I like you a lot, man.

387
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,319
Half for you, half for me.

388
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:05,867
I like you, too, it's just that...
There's nothing we can do, you know?

389
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:09,078
I just want to know one thing.
Do you want to do it or not?

390
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:13,041
Don't be mad, man. We're enjoying
this moment. You're leaving...

391
00:22:13,041 --> 00:22:14,959
I'm not mad. I'm just sad.

392
00:22:14,959 --> 00:22:16,127
Man...

393
00:22:19,213 --> 00:22:20,923
You're not enjoying because...

394
00:22:20,923 --> 00:22:23,551
I was enjoying until now.

395
00:22:33,019 --> 00:22:34,812
You're wonderful, man.

396
00:22:34,812 --> 00:22:35,897
It's freaking cold here.

397
00:22:36,147 --> 00:22:37,273
It's cold, isn't it?

398
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:38,357
Yes, it is.

399
00:22:40,068 --> 00:22:42,153
Live and enjoy the moment.

400
00:22:42,153 --> 00:22:43,821
Do you want to spend the night here, too?

401
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:45,615
No, I'm going home.

402
00:22:45,615 --> 00:22:49,702
Really? Why? Stay here tonight.

403
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,954
- I can't.
- Tomorrow is a new day.

404
00:22:53,498 --> 00:22:54,499
Why can't you stay?

405
00:22:54,499 --> 00:22:55,583
Do you have a cigarette?

406
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,168
Shit, it's inside.

407
00:22:57,168 --> 00:23:00,213
- Because I'm grounded.
- I'm going to smoke now, too.

408
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:01,798
Why is that?

409
00:23:01,798 --> 00:23:04,217
I went out last Saturday
and didn't come home

410
00:23:04,217 --> 00:23:06,010
until 5:00 in the afternoon on Sunday.

411
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,470
She's still a baby, she's 20...

412
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:09,263
How old are you?

413
00:23:09,263 --> 00:23:10,473
Twenty-two.

414
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:11,891
Jesus Christ!

415
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:13,434
Don't be shocked,
she's the love of my life.

416
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:15,686
I love them young.

417
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:17,605
Shit. I'm precocious.

418
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:21,109
So you like them all young?
You're naughty.

419
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:23,903
No, especially the girls...
The ones from Floripa.

420
00:23:34,956 --> 00:23:38,334
By the way, do you want to spend the
night here? Or do you want to leave?

421
00:23:38,918 --> 00:23:41,546
But it seems that you want me to leave.

422
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,257
No, it's not that. I'm going to bed now.

423
00:23:44,257 --> 00:23:48,553
I don't know if you're leaving,
if you want to stay overnight...

424
00:23:50,012 --> 00:23:51,681
I want to sleep with you.
It doesn't matter

425
00:23:51,681 --> 00:23:54,433
if nothing happens.
I just want to sleep with you.

426
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,018
Okay, then, come.

427
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:10,491
What if we keep kissing? Don't you see?
One day at a time. One step at a time.

428
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:12,535
Let's enjoy what we have now.

429
00:24:12,535 --> 00:24:15,913
Man, let's... Let me smoke first.

430
00:24:16,205 --> 00:24:18,541
- Okay, go.
- You can't. You stay right here.

431
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:20,418
Okay, but my boot got stuck.

432
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:22,545
Stay put, I'll be right back. Stay warm.

433
00:24:22,545 --> 00:24:24,922
No, I'm going to the kitchen to see if...

434
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:28,551
So, now, how's João going...
Do you think he's going to get lucky?

435
00:24:28,551 --> 00:24:29,594
You guys are loud.

436
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:30,636
I think he is going to get laid.

437
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:31,679
I don't think he is.

438
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,265
How about the pressure
we put on her with the raw egg?

439
00:24:58,247 --> 00:25:00,249
Oh, my God! Oh, yes!

440
00:25:01,042 --> 00:25:03,502
I told you, guys!

441
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:05,087
Just shoot me. I don't want to see.

442
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:06,047
Oh, my God!

443
00:25:06,047 --> 00:25:07,590
Hard to believe.

444
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,425
- I can't believe that.
- Guys... He...

445
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:13,554
When I'm partying hard
and my alcohol levels are above my neck...

446
00:25:13,554 --> 00:25:15,681
If someone said to me,
"I don't want...

447
00:25:15,681 --> 00:25:16,933
Let's just talk..."

448
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:19,602
What would I say? I'd just say no, okay?

449
00:25:19,602 --> 00:25:21,187
Snuggling in bed
with someone when I'm drunk?

450
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:22,271
- Talk? Right...
- No.

451
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:23,606
So, I think she...

452
00:25:23,606 --> 00:25:25,316
She didn't want to
and he tried to convince her

453
00:25:25,316 --> 00:25:26,484
using some lame excuse.

454
00:25:26,484 --> 00:25:27,777
He should have
been more candid

455
00:25:27,777 --> 00:25:29,695
and say "Let's go upstairs alone."

456
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:30,780
Don't you think, Carol?

457
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:32,240
Yes, but she didn't wanna.

458
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,117
The guy couldn't be like,
"Come upstairs, I want to fuck you."

459
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:37,245
He should have said,
"You told me to eat an egg.

460
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:38,704
You said that if I ate a raw egg
You'd do it."

461
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:41,290
Hold on. Titto,
have you ever used that line?

462
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:42,875
- I think she wants...
- What?

463
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:46,837
Have you ever used this line?
"Let's go over there, I just wanna talk."

464
00:25:47,463 --> 00:25:48,589
The moment he said...

465
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,716
I never said,
"Let's go over there, I wanna talk."

466
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:52,343
I did say, "It's so noisy here,

467
00:25:52,343 --> 00:25:53,552
I can't hear you."

468
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:54,637
Everybody wants to...

469
00:25:54,637 --> 00:25:56,347
I'd love that, I'd say I'm deaf.

470
00:25:56,347 --> 00:25:58,975
"It's noisy here, I can't hear.
Let's find a quieter place."

471
00:25:58,975 --> 00:26:02,103
"I'll go, Titto, I'm deaf!"
I'd start to shout right away.

472
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:04,313
I feel embarrassed for João.

473
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:05,606
- No, João...
- That's bad.

474
00:26:05,606 --> 00:26:07,525
João is a big disappointment.

475
00:26:07,525 --> 00:26:09,318
Is he a Pisces? He's a Pisces.

476
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:10,486
No, he's desperate.

477
00:26:10,486 --> 00:26:11,946
Do you wanna know his sign?

478
00:26:11,946 --> 00:26:13,489
Pisces men are like that.

479
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:14,824
He's desperate, for sure.

480
00:26:14,824 --> 00:26:16,158
He's desperate.

481
00:26:16,701 --> 00:26:18,536
He is very emotional.

482
00:26:18,536 --> 00:26:20,246
- Emotional?
- Absolutely.

483
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:21,580
He's in total despair.

484
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:22,665
No...

485
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:24,208
He's emotional, every emotion is extreme.

486
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:26,585
He was trying to get laid, at any cost.

487
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:28,421
That's exactly right.

488
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:30,047
He'll even cry to get laid.

489
00:26:30,047 --> 00:26:31,507
He was desperately trying...

490
00:26:31,507 --> 00:26:32,717
He probably has blue balls.

491
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:34,218
Tears of horniness.

492
00:26:34,218 --> 00:26:36,345
- Let me say this.
- I think...

493
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:37,555
They hit the floor...

494
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:38,597
And he cries...

495
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:42,768
Listen, I think that João,
he may be this or that, but...

496
00:26:42,768 --> 00:26:44,312
He's a key player in this thing.

497
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:45,479
Obviously.

498
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:46,939
He's a friend who makes it fun.

499
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,274
He didn't buy into the whole drama...

500
00:26:48,274 --> 00:26:49,692
There's always a friend...

501
00:26:49,692 --> 00:26:50,776
It has to be João.

502
00:26:50,901 --> 00:26:52,528
...who doesn't get laid.

503
00:26:52,653 --> 00:26:54,822
The problem is not João getting laid.

504
00:26:54,822 --> 00:26:56,991
The problem is
he cries when he doesn't get laid.

505
00:26:56,991 --> 00:26:58,451
I like a man who cries.

506
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:01,787
Man, Carol is the most peculiar person
I have ever met.

507
00:27:01,787 --> 00:27:06,167
She doesn't kiss, she just has sex.
She sleeps with her legs open.

508
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:09,879
She said she likes men who cry
and naked men wearing ties.

509
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:11,547
Men who are serious and young...

510
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,007
I like a man who cries.

511
00:27:13,007 --> 00:27:13,924
I like them...

512
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:16,302
I once said "I love you"
to someone just to kiss,

513
00:27:16,302 --> 00:27:17,386
just to have sex.

514
00:27:17,386 --> 00:27:18,471
Wow.

515
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:20,765
What's the worst thing
you guys have done to get laid?

516
00:27:20,765 --> 00:27:23,225
You said "I love you"
to a person you'd just met?

517
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:24,810
No, two days later.

518
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,854
I pretended to be
friends with them.

519
00:27:27,313 --> 00:27:29,440
It's just too much, saying "I love you..."

520
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:30,858
To get laid, that's fair game.

521
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:32,109
It is a bit too much.

522
00:27:32,109 --> 00:27:33,402
Men are silly.

523
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:34,737
You'll believe anything we say.

524
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:37,656
What's the worst thing you've done
to get laid?

525
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,075
Something you've done, for sex.

526
00:27:39,075 --> 00:27:41,327
Man, I bought a very expensive video game.

527
00:27:42,536 --> 00:27:44,163
A video game?

528
00:27:44,163 --> 00:27:45,873
It cost me 2,500 reais.

529
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:46,957
She has the best stories.

530
00:27:46,957 --> 00:27:51,796
A video game for 2,500 reais
and I never touched it.

531
00:27:51,796 --> 00:27:52,880
To give to the boy.

532
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,715
No, it wasn't, like, a person.

533
00:27:54,715 --> 00:27:55,800
Several people...

534
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,093
I wanted to lure people in...

535
00:27:57,093 --> 00:27:58,010
I got it.

536
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,262
Like, "Let's play video game in my house."

537
00:28:00,554 --> 00:28:02,723
And you played
Mortal Kombat in your bed.

538
00:28:02,723 --> 00:28:03,849
- I see...
- Got it?

539
00:28:03,849 --> 00:28:04,934
Shit, man.

540
00:28:04,934 --> 00:28:07,186
He plays the video game
and you end it in bed.

541
00:28:07,186 --> 00:28:09,897
But it wasn't one person,
but a collective frame-up.

542
00:28:09,897 --> 00:28:11,273
- Like a trap?
- She did that...

543
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:12,358
A trap.

544
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:13,901
How did she lure the boys in?

545
00:28:13,901 --> 00:28:16,654
Mariano.
You're a married man now and all...

546
00:28:16,654 --> 00:28:18,155
But in the old days,
when you were 15...

547
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:19,824
You wanna play with the Xbox?

548
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:22,576
Oh, boy. I have done so much shit.

549
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,328
- Anything shocking?
- The worst?

550
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:26,956
I've hitched a hike in a bone truck.

551
00:28:26,956 --> 00:28:29,875
I traveled 50 miles in a truck,
from one city to the next.

552
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,877
In a truck full of ox bones...

553
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:33,712
- Were you in the cab?
- No, in the...

554
00:28:33,712 --> 00:28:35,089
In the cargo compartment?

555
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:37,299
Nice to meet you, it was me.

556
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:38,592
Did you kill someone?

557
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:41,929
No, I got to the city...
I took a shower, right?

558
00:28:41,929 --> 00:28:43,347
- Did it work?
- It did.

559
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:46,725
That was some weird stuff.
Riding on a bone truck to get laid.

560
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:48,185
I think it was hot.

561
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:50,896
Imagine this man coming to you
smelling of bones.

562
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:53,858
He gets there with a femur in his hand...
"Honey, I'm home!"

563
00:28:53,858 --> 00:28:55,818
It's like going to bed
with Fred Flintstone.

564
00:28:55,818 --> 00:28:57,153
I would say, "Don't bathe."

565
00:28:57,153 --> 00:29:00,281
I think the video game story
is what made my nipples hard.

566
00:29:00,281 --> 00:29:01,407
- What?
- Video game.

567
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:03,576
My nipples are hard, see?

568
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:04,535
You're drunk.

569
00:29:04,535 --> 00:29:06,829
The perfect trap.
It's going to be there forever.

570
00:29:06,829 --> 00:29:09,248
The question is, does it work?

571
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,125
- Sure.
- The video game or the sex?

572
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:12,042
Yay.

573
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:19,550
Did you get some sleep?

574
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,843
- No.
- I didn't.

575
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:21,927
No?

576
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:23,429
I didn't sleep well at all.

577
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:24,889
Where's your man?

578
00:29:25,181 --> 00:29:26,432
He just won't leave.

579
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:33,439
I think he took it seriously when I said
I'd take him in my luggage.

580
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:34,857
- Yes.
- How do you feel?

581
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:36,317
I don't know.

582
00:29:36,317 --> 00:29:37,818
Have you talked to him?

583
00:29:37,818 --> 00:29:38,903
I'll talk to him.

584
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,993
He's going to... He's hot.

585
00:29:45,993 --> 00:29:49,830
He's hot, a prince.

586
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:52,249
He loves snuggling.
He turned his head...

587
00:29:52,249 --> 00:29:54,460
Don't you want to get his number?

588
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,920
What are you gonna say to him?

589
00:29:55,920 --> 00:30:01,675
I don't know. I'm not good
at asking people to leave.

590
00:30:02,718 --> 00:30:04,845
Just say, "It's time to say goodbye."

591
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:05,804
Bye!

592
00:30:13,354 --> 00:30:15,022
- Guys, look at Blondie.

593
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:17,233
- Look at Blondie.
- That's why it didn't work.

594
00:30:17,233 --> 00:30:18,317
Blondie will dump the guy.

595
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:19,443
Yes, it's Blondie.

596
00:30:20,027 --> 00:30:21,695
I'm going to work soon.

597
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:24,281
- You guys are working today?
- Yes, soon.

598
00:30:24,281 --> 00:30:25,449
Is everybody going?

599
00:30:25,449 --> 00:30:28,077
Yes, we're going to start getting dressed.

600
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:30,704
We're going to get dressed and all.

601
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:34,166
Maybe I'll take a shower before I leave.

602
00:30:34,166 --> 00:30:35,751
I think I'm leaving, too.

603
00:30:36,168 --> 00:30:40,005
Do you know where your stuff is? No.
Do you want... Come on, I'll help you.

604
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:42,758
I guess I do. I'm going
to look for my things.

605
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,520
Bye, prince!

606
00:31:00,192 --> 00:31:01,193
Are the girls upstairs?

607
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,778
Hey, Blondie!

608
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:07,908
Good morning, João.

609
00:31:07,908 --> 00:31:09,618
I'm back.

610
00:31:09,618 --> 00:31:15,708
Come on, I'll get you now.
Come on, come in strong.

611
00:31:21,714 --> 00:31:27,720
Hello? Hi, how are you? Now?

612
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:33,559
All right. Thank you.

613
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:36,520
We'll be there soon. Bye.

614
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:42,192
Guys, we have to pick four people

615
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:44,528
to go to work today, in an hour.

616
00:31:44,862 --> 00:31:46,030
Let's draw lots?

617
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,364
I'll go, no problem.

618
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:48,490
But we have to draw...

619
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,575
Everybody could go.

620
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:51,118
- Let's draw...
- Yes.

621
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,244
Two guys and two girls.

622
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,245
Two or one!

623
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,371
- Two girls...
- Right.

624
00:31:54,371 --> 00:31:56,248
- Two girls and two men.
- Show your hands!

625
00:31:56,248 --> 00:31:58,375
Zero or one! Zero or one!

626
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:01,712
Two or one!

627
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:03,631
Go, Nath!

628
00:32:03,631 --> 00:32:05,382
Are you two going?

629
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:07,009
- Yes.
- Cool.

630
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:08,510
- Guys...
- Are you going, too?

631
00:32:08,510 --> 00:32:10,846
Fuck! It's going to be badass, man.

632
00:32:20,898 --> 00:32:24,193
Let's go to work, huh?
God's children also have to work, right?

633
00:32:24,193 --> 00:32:26,695
God's children also have to work.

634
00:32:28,322 --> 00:32:32,076
For example, if it's necessary...
If it's necessary, sure... Fuck!

635
00:32:36,205 --> 00:32:38,624
How about the four of us
take this time to go see Floripa?

636
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:40,125
- Let's do it.
- Yeah.

637
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:41,710
Watch the sunset.

638
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,796
Wow. Let's do it, it's really good.

639
00:32:44,088 --> 00:32:46,340
We have 20 minutes
to get dressed and be ready.

640
00:32:46,757 --> 00:32:49,385
Let's go see the sunset.

641
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,596
Wow, that's top.

642
00:33:00,229 --> 00:33:01,063
Let's do it.

643
00:33:01,063 --> 00:33:03,774
Girls in front, guys behind.
We're in charge today.

644
00:33:03,774 --> 00:33:07,194
Sounds good. You guys are the bosses.
We're here to obey.

645
00:33:07,194 --> 00:33:08,278
You're here to obey.

646
00:33:09,196 --> 00:33:10,072
You know it.

647
00:33:10,072 --> 00:33:12,157
Would you like me to get the door for you?

648
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:13,158
Nice!

649
00:33:13,158 --> 00:33:16,412
Man, I've never been in a car like this.
Fucking good!

650
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:18,664
Play the game.

651
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:29,174
Look, the boss looks mad.

652
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,051
Good afternoon.

653
00:33:31,051 --> 00:33:31,969
Hello, guys.

654
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:33,262
- How are you?
- How are you?

655
00:33:33,262 --> 00:33:34,388
- Good, you?
- All good.

656
00:33:34,388 --> 00:33:38,726
How are you? Do you remember
I told you the job started today?

657
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:39,685
Yes.

658
00:33:39,685 --> 00:33:42,271
Dress up, get the bar ready,
the customers are coming in.

659
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:43,230
Let's go.

660
00:33:43,230 --> 00:33:44,565
Sounds good.

661
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:51,196
- Come on.
- Let's go.

662
00:33:51,196 --> 00:33:52,281
Yeah, let's go.

663
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:53,991
You look so handsome.

664
00:33:53,991 --> 00:33:55,784
Well... Fuck, yeah.

665
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,673
Things are going to get crazy.

666
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:11,675
Guys? Is the lounge ready?

667
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:12,843
We're good to go.

668
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:14,094
You got it, right?

669
00:34:14,094 --> 00:34:17,389
Good service, a smile on your face,
come to me if you have any questions.

670
00:34:17,389 --> 00:34:18,599
- All right.
- All right?

671
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:22,144
Feel free to greet them, too.
Welcome them.

672
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:24,021
Hello, welcome.

673
00:34:24,229 --> 00:34:27,065
Hey, bro, what's up?
I'm Ramon, how are you?

674
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,651
If you need more chairs,
I can get them for you.

675
00:34:31,403 --> 00:34:32,404
Thank you.

676
00:34:32,571 --> 00:34:33,447
It's five sex...

677
00:34:33,447 --> 00:34:34,740
Do you like "Sex on the beach"?

678
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:36,283
Man, you're something else.

679
00:34:41,747 --> 00:34:43,499
So, I want to know...

680
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:45,751
Where are we going?

681
00:34:45,751 --> 00:34:47,836
I'm in charge today.

682
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:48,879
Can we trust you?

683
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:50,172
You can trust me.

684
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:52,132
Are we getting any booze?

685
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:10,609
Guys, we're here.

686
00:35:11,318 --> 00:35:12,486
We're here.

687
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:14,571
Look at the view, man. Sick!

688
00:35:21,537 --> 00:35:22,996
Gratitude.

689
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,165
Great.

690
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,000
It's good to be out of the house.

691
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:28,085
Go for a ride, right?

692
00:35:28,085 --> 00:35:29,169
What are we doing tonight?

693
00:35:29,169 --> 00:35:30,212
We'll drink.

694
00:35:30,212 --> 00:35:32,381
I wonder if the guys will join us tonight.

695
00:35:32,381 --> 00:35:33,715
- Heck, yeah.
- Of course.

696
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:35,425
Let's do this thing. Let's go.

697
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:36,844
Come on.

698
00:35:48,272 --> 00:35:49,273
Can I sit down?

699
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:50,899
Sure. Be my guest.

700
00:35:50,899 --> 00:35:52,776
Where are you from?

701
00:35:52,776 --> 00:35:54,528
I was born here, but I don't live here.

702
00:35:54,528 --> 00:35:57,781
Where do you live?
Do you know a good beach around here?

703
00:35:57,781 --> 00:36:01,535
I wanted to see the sunset somewhere...

704
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:03,537
Santo Antonio is good...

705
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:04,621
Is it near here?

706
00:36:04,621 --> 00:36:05,581
Morro do Sol is nearby.

707
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:06,540
It's near...

708
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:08,959
Back in our house,
the sunset is stunning...

709
00:36:09,084 --> 00:36:10,127
Is the house by the lake?

710
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:14,673
It's by the lake. The house...
totally awesome. Massive, like...

711
00:36:14,798 --> 00:36:15,757
Oh, yeah?

712
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:17,551
If you want see it,
we can show it to you.

713
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:20,888
For instance, there's some wine there,
heated pool...

714
00:36:20,888 --> 00:36:23,682
We were making a little fondue,
because of the cold...

715
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:26,059
That's nice.
When you say that, it's like...

716
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:29,396
No, but the Law of Return, it...

717
00:36:29,396 --> 00:36:31,857
Excuse me. Ramon, let's go back to work?

718
00:36:31,857 --> 00:36:33,025
Come on.

719
00:36:33,025 --> 00:36:34,192
Now. I need you there.

720
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,861
I'll be right back.

721
00:36:35,861 --> 00:36:36,945
Work?

722
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:39,531
I'll be right back,
with ideas for the afterparty.

723
00:36:39,531 --> 00:36:41,700
Are you interested? What do you think?

724
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,618
Always interested.

725
00:36:42,618 --> 00:36:46,079
Whoa... No. Right? Let's work on that.

726
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:50,375
Listen up, guys...

727
00:36:50,375 --> 00:36:51,460
You're waiting on tables.

728
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,211
Perfect.

729
00:36:53,211 --> 00:36:57,382
And let Ramon work the bar.
The girls can take a break, okay?

730
00:36:57,925 --> 00:36:59,968
I was so happy here, drinking...

731
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:02,554
I don't want to work at the bar.
Five minutes?

732
00:37:04,181 --> 00:37:06,975
I think Nath and Bia
are worried back at the house.

733
00:37:06,975 --> 00:37:09,061
Nath, for sure. Nath must be furious.

734
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:10,145
Yes, look.

735
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,981
Ramon's ears must be burning.

736
00:37:13,649 --> 00:37:15,192
Speak of the devil...

737
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:18,654
Do you guys live around here?

738
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:20,781
We live... In São José, actually.

739
00:37:20,781 --> 00:37:22,324
- Where?
- São José.

740
00:37:22,324 --> 00:37:24,284
- Is it nearby?
- Somewhat near.

741
00:37:24,284 --> 00:37:26,119
- Ramonzito.
- Talk to me.

742
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:27,329
A gin tonic?

743
00:37:27,329 --> 00:37:31,208
Another one? Coming right up.

744
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:32,793
Now you have to do a perfect job.

745
00:37:32,793 --> 00:37:34,628
Focus, because I'm out here alone.

746
00:37:34,628 --> 00:37:37,464
They say that pretty women
don't have to pay.

747
00:37:37,464 --> 00:37:40,050
Well, I'll... Perfect. Gin.

748
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:41,134
Okay.

749
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:45,222
Easy now.

750
00:37:47,349 --> 00:37:52,020
Hey! Holy crap!

751
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:55,565
Am I looking good?

752
00:37:55,565 --> 00:37:56,650
Awesome!

753
00:37:57,693 --> 00:37:58,694
You're looking nice.

754
00:37:58,986 --> 00:38:01,279
So you approve. I behave well, then.

755
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:02,489
Man, come here.

756
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:04,366
Come here.

757
00:38:04,825 --> 00:38:05,951
We have a proposal for you.

758
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:07,536
- A nice proposal.
- I'm listening.

759
00:38:07,536 --> 00:38:10,497
We're having a super top evening,

760
00:38:10,497 --> 00:38:13,542
and it's going to get better,
and we couldn't do it without them.

761
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:16,670
- Are you taking us with you?
- We want to take them with us.

762
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:18,630
Easy there... Easy.

763
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,631
Say yes, Ricardo.

764
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:20,590
Fuck!

765
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:22,384
- The shift isn't over yet.
- No, wait...

766
00:38:22,384 --> 00:38:24,344
But what about your proposal?

767
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:25,470
We have a proposal.

768
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:26,763
The four of us.

769
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:28,432
The four of us for them.

770
00:38:28,724 --> 00:38:30,142
Any time you want us...

771
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:31,852
We'll work tomorrow...

772
00:38:31,852 --> 00:38:34,730
We'll come tomorrow,
plus we'll cover their time.

773
00:38:36,064 --> 00:38:38,191
I'm the one who makes the decisions here.

774
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:41,403
When the shift starts,
who is working... Okay?

775
00:38:41,403 --> 00:38:45,532
Since today was the first day...
Ramon did well.

776
00:38:45,532 --> 00:38:47,367
Ramon!

777
00:38:47,367 --> 00:38:49,745
Luan. Congratulations on your service.

778
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:52,289
- Thanks, man.
- The girls put on a show on the floor.

779
00:38:52,289 --> 00:38:54,458
- You go, girls.
- You're all clear to go.

780
00:38:57,919 --> 00:39:00,714
All for one! We're in this together.

781
00:39:00,714 --> 00:39:03,050
All for one and one for all.

782
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:04,843
That's crazy. Where are we going?

783
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:05,761
Let's go.

784
00:39:05,761 --> 00:39:07,137
Come with us, it's a secret.

785
00:39:07,137 --> 00:39:08,388
Come on. Let's go.

786
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:09,973
I just... Can I change?

787
00:39:09,973 --> 00:39:11,349
Let's go, yes, come on.

788
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:14,644
Come on!

789
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,579
Come on! Let's go!

790
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:36,458
Hey! Let's go!

791
00:39:38,418 --> 00:39:39,252
All good.

792
00:39:39,252 --> 00:39:40,545
We have arrived.

793
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,130
Whoa! Skate park.

794
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,215
Look at that.

795
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:50,680
A shot to warm up?

796
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:51,765
Everybody wants one.

797
00:39:51,765 --> 00:39:55,769
Shot!

798
00:40:06,113 --> 00:40:07,114
I'm a little jealous.

799
00:40:08,031 --> 00:40:09,533
- Relax.
- Are you jealous?

800
00:40:10,826 --> 00:40:12,953
I wanted to be like you, but I can't.

801
00:40:13,078 --> 00:40:14,079
Shameless. Look!

802
00:40:14,329 --> 00:40:16,706
You know what... Funny thing is... Look.

803
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:18,959
Did I give you any reason to be jealous?

804
00:40:19,251 --> 00:40:20,544
No, and even if you did...

805
00:40:20,544 --> 00:40:23,547
You're not jealous? I'm a little jealous.

806
00:40:23,547 --> 00:40:25,423
Not if I trust the guy. Otherwise...

807
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,927
If there's one thing that
drives me crazy, it's jealousy.

808
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:30,053
There's real jealousy.

809
00:40:30,053 --> 00:40:31,096
I'm being upfront.

810
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:32,889
- Okay.
- It drives me nuts, girl.

811
00:40:32,889 --> 00:40:37,102
If I see you making out with another girl,
do you expect me to be zen about it?

812
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:38,603
You'll never see that.

813
00:40:38,603 --> 00:40:40,605
That's fine. It's great.

814
00:40:40,605 --> 00:40:43,775
That's the point.

815
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:45,902
So, I get jealous if I have a reason.

816
00:40:46,027 --> 00:40:47,946
Everyone has to be free, got it?

817
00:40:47,946 --> 00:40:49,364
You do it if you want to.

818
00:40:49,364 --> 00:40:53,493
No, you don't want to be jealous, it's a
matter of respect for the other person.

819
00:40:53,493 --> 00:40:56,872
That's it.
This, "You do it if you want to..."

820
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:57,998
I'd never stop you...

821
00:40:57,998 --> 00:40:58,957
That's wrong.

822
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,501
...or I'd never say, like,
"If you do this or that."

823
00:41:01,501 --> 00:41:05,005
Because you know what's at stake.

824
00:41:05,005 --> 00:41:07,215
I don't need to mention it,
and I know it.

825
00:41:07,215 --> 00:41:08,216
Exactly.

826
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:11,094
And we're both free,
we can make the choices we want.

827
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:12,470
That's for sure.

828
00:41:18,476 --> 00:41:20,061
I'll be honest with you.

829
00:41:20,061 --> 00:41:22,898
I like you, but... That's the point.

830
00:41:23,023 --> 00:41:25,317
I know, man.
But brother, I'm totally free.

831
00:41:25,317 --> 00:41:26,776
I'm totally free...

832
00:41:26,776 --> 00:41:29,613
And you've always
made it very clear to her.

833
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:31,114
I'm going to sit down with her...

834
00:41:31,114 --> 00:41:32,866
I'm going to say, "Here's the thing..."

835
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:34,451
Or you... No.

836
00:41:34,451 --> 00:41:37,120
Brother, it's not going to happen anymore.

837
00:41:38,330 --> 00:41:39,289
It's your decision.

838
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:42,125
I don't want the girl
to have any more expectations.

839
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:47,380
I love you, man.

840
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,133
I love you, too.
Stop it, I want to roll with you.

841
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:51,760
With no jealousy around.

842
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,595
Relax. All cool.

843
00:41:55,388 --> 00:41:56,223
What's going on?

844
00:41:56,223 --> 00:41:58,225
I was waiting for you
so I could drink some more.

845
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:22,249
One step at a time.

846
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:28,546
Are you all right?

847
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,424
I just have to pee, that's all. Come on.

848
00:42:31,424 --> 00:42:32,425
What's up, man?

849
00:42:32,425 --> 00:42:34,886
- I heard João saying some stuff to Murilo.
- Seriously?

850
00:42:34,886 --> 00:42:37,347
João said,
"You're going to be a player again, right?

851
00:42:37,347 --> 00:42:40,308
Back to the game." And then he...

852
00:42:40,475 --> 00:42:43,228
- João?
- Jo... Girl...

853
00:42:48,650 --> 00:42:53,071
Come on, girlfriend.
One, two, three and... Whoa!

854
00:42:53,196 --> 00:42:55,907
Who can chug it faster? Go!

855
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:34,571
Always. Same old, same old.

856
00:43:36,239 --> 00:43:37,574
Blondie... Hey, you...

857
00:43:37,574 --> 00:43:38,742
Nothing has changed.

858
00:43:38,742 --> 00:43:40,660
I'm home, that's all that matters.

859
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:41,745
Yeah, man. Man!

860
00:43:41,745 --> 00:43:44,789
That's all that matters. I am perfect.

861
00:43:44,789 --> 00:43:47,208
Hey, be careful.

862
00:43:47,876 --> 00:43:53,882
I can't open my eyes, but I got it
under control. I'm still in control.

863
00:43:53,882 --> 00:43:56,051
I need a shower. I feel like I stink.

864
00:43:56,176 --> 00:43:57,177
I know... Like this...

865
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:03,850
Wait...

866
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:09,481
Hey, okay... Murilão, I'm waiting
to have a chat with you.

867
00:44:09,731 --> 00:44:11,149
Have a chat, João?

868
00:44:11,149 --> 00:44:12,817
Every time you have a chat...

869
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:15,278
Hey, easy. Please.

870
00:44:15,278 --> 00:44:17,238
Stop talking, seriously. Easy.

871
00:44:17,238 --> 00:44:21,284
What? Easy, my ass! I'm furious!

872
00:44:21,743 --> 00:44:24,621
Man, have I ever said to you,
"Let's get married"?

873
00:44:24,621 --> 00:44:28,208
- No! You haven't.
- Get real, seriously. Today. Now.

874
00:44:28,208 --> 00:44:31,252
Murilo, you need to be more sensitive
to my feelings.

875
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:32,295
- I'm not?
- I came here...

876
00:44:32,295 --> 00:44:35,548
- Do you think I'm doing you wrong?
- I really came here to fight...

877
00:44:35,548 --> 00:44:37,550
Saline. Make her drink this.

878
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:41,096
I didn't want to like you, but I do.

879
00:44:41,096 --> 00:44:43,306
Turn on the shower.

880
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:46,101
Let's lie down, okay? Please, lie down.

881
00:44:46,101 --> 00:44:48,311
- No, I need another shower.
- Please.

882
00:44:48,311 --> 00:44:49,604
- I wanna know...
- Please.

883
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:52,357
Take a shower... I want my friends.

884
00:44:52,899 --> 00:44:55,527
Your friends will talk
to you in the bedroom.

885
00:44:55,527 --> 00:44:57,278
No, I want you out of here. Please.

886
00:44:57,278 --> 00:44:58,405
I'll get out.

887
00:44:58,405 --> 00:45:00,698
But I'm taking you to the bedroom safely.

888
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:05,745
- Get out...
- Guys, can I come in?

889
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:09,290
I didn't want to like him, but I do.

890
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:11,126
Can I come in?

891
00:45:11,126 --> 00:45:13,962
I... Get out of here, please, Murilo.

892
00:45:14,129 --> 00:45:17,090
Okay. Stay here. Come here.

893
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:18,675
Stay with her in the bathroom.

894
00:45:18,675 --> 00:45:19,759
I'm done with it.

895
00:45:23,096 --> 00:45:28,601
Girl, stop saying this shit.
What happened? What's going on, girl?

896
00:45:28,601 --> 00:45:30,895
What happened is that Murilo makes me cry.

897
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:35,900
She made her statement,

898
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:38,820
"We're doing it today."
Then she got hammered.

899
00:45:40,113 --> 00:45:43,032
She's going to bed to sleep.
She's a fucking idiot.

900
00:45:54,419 --> 00:45:59,132
Brother, I don't need the maximum,
I need the minimum, get it? The minimum.

901
00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:02,093
The minimum, man. Got it?

902
00:46:02,093 --> 00:46:03,553
We're not living in the minimum.

903
00:46:03,553 --> 00:46:05,263
We are living at the maximum.

904
00:46:05,263 --> 00:46:07,557
- That's good. Okay.
- You need to be firm.

905
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:08,641
All he said was true.

906
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:12,312
You just have to mind what you say,
what you talk about and, shit...

907
00:46:12,312 --> 00:46:13,938
Be upfront about it.

908
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:17,734
If you think that she felt it,
talk to her tomorrow, say,

909
00:46:17,734 --> 00:46:19,277
"Did you feel this and that?

910
00:46:19,277 --> 00:46:21,154
You got it wrong.
It was this and that!"

911
00:46:21,154 --> 00:46:22,906
I told her several times. Today...

912
00:46:22,906 --> 00:46:24,657
- Do you understand?
- I talked to her.

913
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:25,867
It's over... Guys.

914
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:27,327
It's the relationship.

915
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:30,872
We just have to say things as they are.

916
00:46:31,414 --> 00:46:33,041
"You'll do this or that with Luan."

917
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:34,709
You guys figure it out, okay?

918
00:46:34,709 --> 00:46:36,336
Do you want an example?

919
00:46:36,336 --> 00:46:38,004
You don't have to say a thing.

920
00:46:38,004 --> 00:46:39,547
It's the lion and the lioness.

921
00:46:39,547 --> 00:46:42,258
- I'm sorry.
- It's over, okay, guys?

922
00:46:42,258 --> 00:46:44,219
I'm not getting laid,
you've ruined it for me.

923
00:46:44,219 --> 00:46:45,929
I'm the one who should be mad.

924
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:51,184
Well, now I'm going to bed, partner,
because tomorrow it's going to be hard.

925
00:46:51,184 --> 00:46:52,810
I have to work. Good night.

926
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:54,437
No...

927
00:46:54,437 --> 00:46:55,855
I was in bed, but I need socks.

928
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:57,273
Hey, Tay...

929
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:58,358
Hi, honey.

930
00:46:58,483 --> 00:46:59,317
Let me ask you something.

931
00:46:59,317 --> 00:47:00,818
When you overheard Murilo and João...

932
00:47:00,818 --> 00:47:02,737
- Careful there.
- Hey, sit down.

933
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:04,572
My only problem is that he told me...

934
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:05,657
Easy...

935
00:47:05,657 --> 00:47:07,992
...he liked me and then that
he didn't feel anything,

936
00:47:07,992 --> 00:47:09,577
that my heart doesn't belong to him.

937
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:10,578
But did he say that?

938
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:13,081
He did. To my face, in front of Blondie.

939
00:47:14,082 --> 00:47:15,542
A flower is always nice...

940
00:47:15,542 --> 00:47:18,628
The boy gave a flower,
but he gave his heart.

941
00:47:18,628 --> 00:47:20,463
- No.
- But she's got your heart.

942
00:47:20,588 --> 00:47:21,589
No, she hasn't.

943
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:24,259
If he doesn't acknowledge my feelings,
shut up and no talk.

944
00:47:24,259 --> 00:47:25,385
That's all I ask.

945
00:47:25,385 --> 00:47:27,178
- Careful there.
- I'm not a child.

946
00:47:31,683 --> 00:47:34,394
Sit with me
and tell me exactly what it is.

947
00:47:34,394 --> 00:47:37,105
That's what I want,
sincerity and maturity.

948
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:41,818
That's where you look me in the eye
and say, "Relax. Just relax.

949
00:47:41,818 --> 00:47:47,490
If I said I'm with you, if I ever
screw up, you'll be the first to know."

950
00:47:47,615 --> 00:47:49,576
What if he's honest with you
and you don't like it?

951
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:51,661
Exactly, but he said it.

952
00:47:51,661 --> 00:47:52,912
What's the truth?

953
00:47:52,912 --> 00:47:55,206
He was upfront with you. Then you hurt me.

954
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:56,666
He's free? That he's a player?

955
00:47:56,666 --> 00:48:00,587
Look me in the eye. Look me
in the eye and say, "I'm a player.

956
00:48:00,587 --> 00:48:02,672
What we have in the house is one thing.

957
00:48:02,672 --> 00:48:04,882
Out here, it's a different story."

958
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:07,343
I just need honesty. I was upset today...

959
00:48:07,343 --> 00:48:08,720
He's being upfront with you.

960
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:10,555
I was very upset today because...

961
00:48:10,555 --> 00:48:12,807
Girl, I didn't even know
what was going on.

962
00:48:12,807 --> 00:48:14,559
You were assuming things, then.

963
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,729
No! She said,
"But aren't you falling for her?"

964
00:48:17,729 --> 00:48:20,189
And he said,
"No. Not falling for her at all."

965
00:48:20,189 --> 00:48:23,276
Fuck! Then, in the afternoon,
Thais says he's falling for me.

966
00:48:23,401 --> 00:48:25,820
He looks me in the eye and says,
"Not even close."

967
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:28,072
If he doesn't acknowledge
my feelings, shut up.

968
00:48:28,072 --> 00:48:30,450
No, João, if you don't know shit, shut up.

969
00:48:30,450 --> 00:48:31,743
What upset me today

970
00:48:31,743 --> 00:48:35,663
was that he told me and Blondie
that he's not falling for me.

971
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:36,748
- Easy. Calm down.
- Fuck!

972
00:48:36,748 --> 00:48:39,584
No, my friend. Screw it.

973
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:41,336
But then he comes and says...

974
00:48:41,336 --> 00:48:44,797
He keeps telling me, all afternoon,
that I'm different and stuff,

975
00:48:44,797 --> 00:48:46,841
that my soul is this and that...

976
00:48:46,841 --> 00:48:48,176
But that's how he feels.

977
00:48:48,176 --> 00:48:50,136
But then... Don't come...

978
00:48:50,136 --> 00:48:52,639
- He was lying.
- It's not... It's not a lie, man.

979
00:48:52,639 --> 00:48:57,018
So don't tell me that he's not
falling for me at all.

980
00:48:57,018 --> 00:49:00,271
- Got it? That got me very upset.
- The thing is... Easy.

981
00:49:00,396 --> 00:49:02,273
If he wants to hook up
with several people,

982
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:03,483
that's fine.

983
00:49:03,483 --> 00:49:05,276
Calm down.

984
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:06,319
Look what you're doing with me!

985
00:49:06,319 --> 00:49:09,030
Girlfriend. Come here, give me a hug.

986
00:49:09,030 --> 00:49:11,949
Calm down, he understands.
He got it. He already...

987
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:13,993
That's why I was mad. He told me...

988
00:49:13,993 --> 00:49:16,412
Screw it. Look, I'm your brother, man.

989
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:18,539
Hey, what's going on? Easy, man.

990
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:21,542
Don't fucking shove me. Fuck you!

991
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:25,004
Fuck her... She's shoving me
and hitting me! Her!

992
00:49:25,129 --> 00:49:27,256
Don't just say stuff you don't mean...

993
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:28,758
He wasn't really serious.

994
00:49:28,758 --> 00:49:30,259
Take it easy.

995
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:32,804
Hey, take it easy!

996
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:33,971
He didn't mean that.

997
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:37,141
- That's all I asked.
- No, it wasn't. Calm down.

998
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:38,184
...both points of view.

999
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:40,937
What happened?
I didn't see, I was in the bathroom.

1000
00:49:40,937 --> 00:49:42,855
I don't even know, bro. I'm so fucked up.

1001
00:49:44,065 --> 00:49:45,066
Oh, my God!

1002
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:46,859
This is the booze talking.

1003
00:49:46,859 --> 00:49:48,111
"I don't even know, bro."

1004
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:51,280
Guys, João is the best.

1005
00:49:51,447 --> 00:49:53,825
Yes. "I don't even know.
I'm so fucked up!"

1006
00:49:54,117 --> 00:49:56,661
João said the only sensible thing there.

1007
00:49:56,661 --> 00:50:00,289
"What happened?"
"I don't even know, I'm so fucked up!"

1008
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:01,999
There. He solved the problem.

1009
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:04,585
- Guys, I only argue like that for food.
- Really?

1010
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:06,629
I'm not going to get stressed for a man.

1011
00:50:06,629 --> 00:50:09,006
If I was drunk, I would play some music.

1012
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:12,176
-"Stop fighting! We are here!"
- But let me tell you something now.

1013
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:13,553
I like to keep the peace, too.

1014
00:50:13,553 --> 00:50:16,681
I think that it's all very intense. Okay.

1015
00:50:16,681 --> 00:50:18,683
But I mean... "I'm so fucked up!"

1016
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:19,600
Lying to a liar.

1017
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,685
I have a meme.

1018
00:50:20,685 --> 00:50:23,312
No... It was completely senseless.

1019
00:50:23,312 --> 00:50:27,775
He didn't hook up with another woman.
He didn't do anything.

1020
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:31,946
He was honest. He said,
"I'm not as involved as you are."

1021
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:33,531
I don't even think it's true.

1022
00:50:33,531 --> 00:50:34,866
He told it to João.

1023
00:50:34,866 --> 00:50:38,035
The other girl went there
and played broken telephone.

1024
00:50:38,035 --> 00:50:39,078
Chinese whispers?

1025
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:41,748
Yes. Oh, yeah, Chinese whispers,
that's when they talk.

1026
00:50:41,748 --> 00:50:44,417
If it's broken, you can't hear it, shit.

1027
00:50:44,417 --> 00:50:46,711
Maybe where she's from,
phones don't work...

1028
00:50:46,711 --> 00:50:49,464
Have you ever been dumped in your lives?

1029
00:50:49,464 --> 00:50:52,425
Yes, but, seriously,
there's no reason for all this stress.

1030
00:50:52,425 --> 00:50:53,509
Obviously, girl.

1031
00:50:53,509 --> 00:50:55,136
And how do you feel about it?

1032
00:50:55,136 --> 00:50:57,638
It's super important to experience
the sadness.

1033
00:50:57,638 --> 00:50:58,598
Then get over it.

1034
00:50:58,598 --> 00:51:01,267
He said to his friend,

1035
00:51:01,267 --> 00:51:03,770
"It's not working anymore.
I'll talk to her tomorrow."

1036
00:51:03,770 --> 00:51:04,854
He wakes up in the morning,

1037
00:51:04,854 --> 00:51:06,063
"I'm going to keep seeing her."

1038
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,648
- Then what?
- Hold on.

1039
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:09,025
Here's the thing.

1040
00:51:09,025 --> 00:51:10,193
It's not, "Ain't going to happen."

1041
00:51:10,318 --> 00:51:14,864
He was playing her from
the beginning and now he says,

1042
00:51:14,864 --> 00:51:15,865
"I don't want it anymore."

1043
00:51:15,865 --> 00:51:19,410
- How do you mean, playing? Playing what?
- He was kind of... undecided.

1044
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:20,411
No... It's...

1045
00:51:20,411 --> 00:51:22,747
No, they were having
a good relationship.

1046
00:51:22,747 --> 00:51:24,874
They were getting along pretty well.

1047
00:51:24,874 --> 00:51:27,335
And what did you think
about this whole situation?

1048
00:51:27,335 --> 00:51:29,003
If you were in her shoes?

1049
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:30,880
Oh, my God! I don't know.

1050
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,507
- No, seriously.
- Crocodile tears.

1051
00:51:32,507 --> 00:51:35,968
Yeah, girlfriend... Would I be mad?
I would be mad.

1052
00:51:37,887 --> 00:51:39,096
Titto, I'm going to smack you.

1053
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,765
I love it!

1054
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:43,267
Would I be pissed? I would, but like...

1055
00:51:43,267 --> 00:51:46,229
Do we want to make out?
Let's make out. Let's drink, that's it.

1056
00:51:46,229 --> 00:51:49,524
I like getting even more than...
Getting mad.

1057
00:51:49,524 --> 00:51:51,609
That way, the guy sees I'm into him.

1058
00:51:51,609 --> 00:51:54,111
Does getting even show you're into him?

1059
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:56,864
- But that's...
- Maybe, maybe not.

1060
00:51:56,864 --> 00:51:58,324
It depends on how you do it.

1061
00:51:58,324 --> 00:52:00,326
If you know how to do it.

1062
00:52:00,326 --> 00:52:01,744
Like, for instance, look.

1063
00:52:01,744 --> 00:52:06,332
You're with one guy and then you see
the guy's with someone else at the party.

1064
00:52:06,332 --> 00:52:08,292
Then you make out in front of him.

1065
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:10,795
To show him that you were
so upset that you do that.

1066
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:12,505
Or that you could care less...

1067
00:52:12,505 --> 00:52:15,550
Yes, look, but in this case,

1068
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:18,386
it was just... It was just
talk and gossip, right?

1069
00:52:18,386 --> 00:52:22,723
I would pretend my friend
didn't say a thing and then,

1070
00:52:22,723 --> 00:52:26,811
the next day, he would say,
"I don't want it anymore, so..."

1071
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:28,479
"No, it's all right, man,

1072
00:52:28,479 --> 00:52:33,693
I'm also here to enjoy the vibe
and stuff, relax."

1073
00:52:33,693 --> 00:52:36,696
On the inside, I would be like,
"I'm going to kill him."

1074
00:52:36,696 --> 00:52:37,905
But I wouldn't show it.

1075
00:52:37,905 --> 00:52:39,323
Like, "It was on my mind."

1076
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:42,493
Then I'd go to a party,
get another guy, but...

1077
00:52:42,493 --> 00:52:45,705
But, like... I wouldn't let
him see, but he would know it.

1078
00:52:45,705 --> 00:52:49,041
I would do it in front of João,
and João would tell him. Got it?

1079
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:51,085
You know what I would do? Worse than that.

1080
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:54,046
I would tag him
as a close friend on Instagram...

1081
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:57,717
I would only post things
for my close friends

1082
00:52:57,717 --> 00:52:59,427
and he would see that I'm happy.

1083
00:52:59,427 --> 00:53:03,264
I think that if you eat quietly,
you eat more, my opinion.

1084
00:53:03,723 --> 00:53:05,933
What if you're not getting anyone,
like João?

1085
00:53:05,933 --> 00:53:08,436
No, João is a different story.

1086
00:53:08,436 --> 00:53:10,271
João isn't getting laid at all.

1087
00:53:10,396 --> 00:53:13,316
Let's take a poll here, now.
You guys at home.

1088
00:53:13,316 --> 00:53:15,276
Do you think João will get laid?

1089
00:53:15,401 --> 00:53:17,445
Before the end of the series?
I think he will.

1090
00:53:17,445 --> 00:53:18,487
Call zero...

1091
00:53:18,487 --> 00:53:23,492
Dude, I was so sorry for João, man.
Like, it was not his fault, you know?

1092
00:53:23,492 --> 00:53:27,371
You see, he's hot... The guy is funny,
as much as he can...

1093
00:53:27,496 --> 00:53:29,540
- He cries...
- And he didn't get laid.

1094
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:33,669
So, it was all for nothing?
Everything was thrown away?

1095
00:53:33,669 --> 00:53:36,297
I'm not... Do you think I'm a fool?

1096
00:53:36,297 --> 00:53:39,091
ON THE NEXT EPISODE

1097
00:53:42,511 --> 00:53:45,973
You want to be respected, earn it. If you
can't handle it, don't get involved.

1098
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:48,184
- I told you...
- Fuck you!

1099
00:53:52,688 --> 00:53:55,358
Friendship's over.
No more respect. It's over.

1100
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:57,151
The fight gets ugly.

1101
00:53:57,151 --> 00:53:59,070
Sooner or later that's what happens.

1102
00:53:59,070 --> 00:54:00,196
No matter how hard you try.

1103
00:54:00,196 --> 00:54:04,867
Just imagine, the two are drinking booze,
confined in that house, there's a crowd...

1104
00:54:04,867 --> 00:54:06,494
At some point, things get ugly.

1105
00:54:06,494 --> 00:54:07,578
Can't wait for the next episode.

1106
00:54:07,578 --> 00:54:08,663
Me, too.

1107
00:54:08,663 --> 00:54:10,706
A, I want to know if João
is going to get laid.

1108
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:15,586
- B, if...
- Letter B... Number A, number B.

1109
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:18,422
Look, B.

1110
00:54:18,422 --> 00:54:21,008
To see if that fight
is going to continue like that.

1111
00:54:21,008 --> 00:54:24,345
They have been showing signs
of that since the first episode.

1112
00:54:24,345 --> 00:54:27,390
In the second one, there was that fight,
but he got away...

1113
00:54:27,390 --> 00:54:31,394
He turned away from the fight,
but now he's coming in strong.

1114
00:54:31,394 --> 00:54:32,728
There's going to be more

1115
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:33,854
fights besides Murilo's...

1116
00:54:33,854 --> 00:54:35,064
Do you know what?

1117
00:54:35,064 --> 00:54:36,691
João is getting laid
in the third episode.

1118
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:38,025
Honest to God, the third...

1119
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:40,736
The way he's doing things,
he'll never get laid.

1120
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:42,363
He'll get laid in the third episode.
Wanna bet?

1121
00:54:42,363 --> 00:54:44,407
Actually, I think João is a virgin.

1122
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:49,996
But if he doesn't get laid,
João will help calm things down.

1123
00:54:49,996 --> 00:54:51,455
Or make things worse.

1124
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,916
The third episode
will show João getting laid

1125
00:54:53,916 --> 00:54:56,085
and Taynara making up or breaking up...

1126
00:54:56,085 --> 00:54:57,336
- Or what?
- Have sex with what?

1127
00:54:57,336 --> 00:54:58,713
With what? With a tree...

1128
00:54:58,713 --> 00:55:01,090
He will... The exhaust pipe of the jeep...

1129
00:55:01,298 --> 00:55:03,259
I don't think João is going to get laid.

1130
00:55:03,259 --> 00:55:05,011
They are fighting
and making out again.

1131
00:55:05,011 --> 00:55:06,804
I agree. I think João will get laid.

1132
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:09,181
He won't. João is not getting laid.

1133
00:55:09,181 --> 00:55:10,266
If he didn't that time...

1134
00:55:10,266 --> 00:55:11,934
I think João will not get laid

1135
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:13,728
and he will be blamed
for all the trouble.

1136
00:55:13,853 --> 00:55:15,104
João will die a virgin.

1137
00:55:15,104 --> 00:55:17,523
It's not happening in the third, fourth...

1138
00:55:17,523 --> 00:55:19,275
No, not the end of the series.

1139
00:55:19,275 --> 00:55:20,693
I think it's the last one.

1140
00:55:20,693 --> 00:55:21,819
It's going to be in the third.

1141
00:55:21,819 --> 00:55:23,446
Let's talk about the third.

1142
00:55:23,446 --> 00:55:24,655
João gets laid in the third episode?

1143
00:55:24,655 --> 00:55:25,781
No.

1144
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:26,741
- Will he get laid?
- No.

1145
00:55:26,741 --> 00:55:27,825
- Will he?
- No.

1146
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:28,909
- Will he?
- I think so.

1147
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:30,286
- I think he will.
- No...

1148
00:55:30,286 --> 00:55:31,954
So, we'll find out next week.

1149
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:33,497
- Let's wait.
- It's going to be...

1150
00:55:33,497 --> 00:55:35,958
I think they are all
goofing around, seriously.

1151
00:55:35,958 --> 00:55:37,543
If João gets laid, I'll be surprised...

1152
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:39,378
- What do you think?
- They're goofing around.

1153
00:55:39,378 --> 00:55:40,921
- Get some drops, then.
- João...

1154
00:55:40,921 --> 00:55:44,091
- You idiot! That was really bad.
- I think we make a great duo.

1155
00:55:44,091 --> 00:55:46,427
- If João...
- Those two...

1156
00:55:46,427 --> 00:55:47,720
If João gets laid, he'll be surprised.

1157
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:48,721
He'll lose his virginity.

1158
00:55:48,721 --> 00:55:52,183
That's true. But... A duo.
