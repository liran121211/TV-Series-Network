1
00:00:15,975 --> 00:00:19,186
Guys, we're here.

2
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:21,313
We're here.

3
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:24,150
I missed you, buddy.

4
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,694
No, you didn't. You didn't.
Don't be a phony.

5
00:00:26,694 --> 00:00:29,071
- Oh, man...
- The last episode.

6
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:31,615
- The last episode, guys.
- It's not the last.

7
00:00:32,658 --> 00:00:35,786
Let's be quick this time
because I can barely breathe.

8
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:40,291
Bring something here.

9
00:00:43,169 --> 00:00:46,380
Can you scooch over just a little bit?

10
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:49,633
You look like those Spartan heroes.

11
00:00:51,135 --> 00:00:53,471
- Shut up, Felipe.
- It's just...

12
00:00:53,471 --> 00:00:55,139
I think you should look that way.

13
00:00:57,016 --> 00:01:00,144
Don't do this. Don't bully me.

14
00:01:00,144 --> 00:01:01,729
Is it showing? Bullshit.

15
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:04,398
- Fuck.
- Girl, I also... The skirt...

16
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,984
- What now?
- Beautiful girl.

17
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:13,824
We're here together to watch
the last episode of Wild and Free.

18
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:18,037
Remember that in the the last episode,
it almost ended in a rumble.

19
00:01:18,037 --> 00:01:19,538
- That's true.
- In short,

20
00:01:19,538 --> 00:01:21,457
Ramon broke up with Nath again.

21
00:01:21,457 --> 00:01:22,792
That's something new.

22
00:01:22,792 --> 00:01:25,419
He found out she gave someone a peck,

23
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:27,004
right, baby? Gossip, right?

24
00:01:27,004 --> 00:01:30,090
This series tells the story
of eight friends on vacation,

25
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,343
and there's no script.
Everything is real.

26
00:01:32,968 --> 00:01:34,637
Let's watch this?

27
00:01:34,637 --> 00:01:39,183
- Press play.
- I'm delighted, sweetheart.

28
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:11,966
WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS

29
00:02:28,566 --> 00:02:30,818
Jeez, you were rude to those guys.

30
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:32,611
That's why Mu got pissed.

31
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:35,406
I was pissed because... I was sleeping.

32
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:37,992
- Let's go to bed.
- Why are you up here?

33
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:40,202
Taynara, let's go to bed, okay?

34
00:02:40,202 --> 00:02:42,746
Who? I'm fine... Who let you come up here?

35
00:02:42,746 --> 00:02:44,540
Get a grip, Taynara. It's cool...

36
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:45,749
Leave me here.

37
00:02:45,749 --> 00:02:47,543
I hate being woken up. I hate it.

38
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:50,546
Murilo saw me,
I was in the bathroom, furious.

39
00:02:51,088 --> 00:02:52,756
Bastard, he had to get beaten.

40
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,091
Even I wanted to beat him.

41
00:02:54,216 --> 00:02:56,176
He didn't have to come upstairs.

42
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:58,178
And I asked, "Why are you up here?"

43
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:04,560
Then I said, "But you can't come up here.
This is our bedroom. You can't be here."

44
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,562
That's fucked up, Tay, man.

45
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:08,397
Jeez, that's way fucked up.

46
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,158
I think it's the manager.

47
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:23,913
- Jeez.
- Hey, guys, how are you?

48
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:26,999
I will need you one more time at the bar.

49
00:03:26,999 --> 00:03:31,128
Tonight I'm counting on the boys, okay?

50
00:03:31,128 --> 00:03:32,713
See you later.

51
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,215
Tell him I won't come.
I'm calling in sick.

52
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:37,509
I don't want to work anymore.

53
00:03:47,895 --> 00:03:49,355
Hey, Jão.

54
00:03:49,772 --> 00:03:51,148
It's here.

55
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,902
Let's go?

56
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:14,880
Good evening, guys. Get in here.
Let's have fun tonight.

57
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:30,104
Did you like the drink?

58
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:31,814
- What? It's wonderful.
- Good?

59
00:04:31,814 --> 00:04:33,983
It was prepared with love and affection.

60
00:04:33,983 --> 00:04:36,318
I even put a little action figure in it.

61
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,612
You put a pretty little one, right?

62
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:40,614
For you can say,
"This is me."

63
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:42,700
What's your name?

64
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,743
- João Vitor, you?
- My name is Isadora.

65
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,412
It's a pleasure to meet you.

66
00:04:46,537 --> 00:04:49,206
Is the carioca's order still on?
It's not allowed?

67
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:51,208
- What's not allowed?
- To kiss you.

68
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:52,459
It's allowed.

69
00:04:59,174 --> 00:05:02,302
I don't want to work anymore.
I'll be cool in a while.

70
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:04,638
- I have work to do.
- Aren't you working?

71
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,515
Didn't I tell you I had...

72
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:09,852
- I'm going back right now.
- I guess you already made her order?

73
00:05:09,852 --> 00:05:11,186
Yes.

74
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:19,528
- Do it tomorrow?
- Tomorrow...

75
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,280
There's nothing right now.

76
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,116
Man, tomorrow we're having
a boat party here.

77
00:05:24,116 --> 00:05:27,244
There's going to be a lot of babes,
just the local girls.

78
00:05:27,244 --> 00:05:29,079
It's going to be great. Wanna go?

79
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,956
Yeah, man.

80
00:05:30,956 --> 00:05:33,417
Invite the guys and let's go.

81
00:05:33,417 --> 00:05:34,793
No problem. Cool.

82
00:05:34,793 --> 00:05:38,255
All you guys need is a boat
to come along with the gang.

83
00:05:38,255 --> 00:05:39,882
- Okay.
- No boat, no party.

84
00:05:40,007 --> 00:05:41,050
- Okay.
- Deal?

85
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,593
- Deal.
- If you have a boat...

86
00:05:42,593 --> 00:05:44,261
You have a party.

87
00:05:44,261 --> 00:05:46,513
- With whisky.
- That's it.

88
00:05:47,681 --> 00:05:52,186
Hey, guys. Listen up,
I've just gotten an invitation.

89
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:54,146
There's going to be a party tomorrow,

90
00:05:54,146 --> 00:05:57,024
with a bunch of boats.
We were invited and we're coming.

91
00:05:58,776 --> 00:06:00,360
- Where?
- It's here.

92
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,530
The guys who have big yachts
are going to take us for a ride.

93
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,407
He's at the last table there.

94
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:06,825
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

95
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:08,660
I saw when he invited you.

96
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,704
This is it, bro. You're nuts.

97
00:06:10,704 --> 00:06:12,956
Remember I told you about yacht parties?

98
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:15,959
Yeah! He said there's going
to be a lot of beautiful girls.

99
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:16,877
Yeah?

100
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:20,714
Yes, the morning is mine.

101
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,382
Get to work, carioca.

102
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:23,634
He's working hard tonight.

103
00:06:23,634 --> 00:06:25,511
This guy is a slacker.

104
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:30,182
After my shift, I want to talk to you...

105
00:06:30,182 --> 00:06:31,809
You've always said good things...

106
00:06:31,809 --> 00:06:36,522
After you're done, we'll talk, along with
the people who are working, okay?

107
00:06:36,522 --> 00:06:38,148
You'd better say it now.

108
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:39,566
Here's the thing.

109
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:42,111
I've just gotten invited with all the guys

110
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:44,905
to take a boat ride tomorrow.
There's going to be a party.

111
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:50,410
There's going to be a lot of boats...

112
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,329
A ride on the high seas.

113
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:56,041
But we don't have a boat, you do.

114
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:59,128
And I'd like to propose some way

115
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:04,091
of paying you back, working for you...

116
00:07:04,091 --> 00:07:05,717
The nerve of you guys!

117
00:07:05,717 --> 00:07:08,428
- For us to enjoy our...
- You want my boat again?

118
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:11,807
- If you want to come along, that's okay.
- You can take the boat.

119
00:07:13,058 --> 00:07:16,562
I have an appointment at the end
of the day, not the whole day.

120
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:18,438
I need the boat by evening.

121
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,066
- Cool?
- We'll return it in the afternoon.

122
00:07:21,066 --> 00:07:23,152
You're the best boss in the world.

123
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:25,696
I'm not lending it to you, but to João.

124
00:07:25,696 --> 00:07:28,991
Oh, fuck! You're fucked up!

125
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:31,451
But you can go along with him.

126
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:33,328
- If we want.
- Get to work.

127
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,538
Don't touch me.

128
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:35,747
Get to work. Take off.

129
00:07:35,747 --> 00:07:37,124
Don't touch me.

130
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,263
I want to see it. Dance.

131
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:05,944
- I'll come along.
- Will you?

132
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:08,530
I have to wear this for 15 minutes.

133
00:08:11,408 --> 00:08:12,784
Fuck.

134
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,180
There's going to be a party
called The Roof.

135
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,890
What kind of music?

136
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,517
It's deep house.

137
00:08:37,517 --> 00:08:38,727
Wow, that's cool.

138
00:08:38,727 --> 00:08:41,271
I hope it's not country again.

139
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,356
It would be cool.

140
00:09:18,183 --> 00:09:19,685
It's the best, right?

141
00:09:23,814 --> 00:09:25,190
Low ceiling, right?

142
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:29,444
Is there room for everybody in here?

143
00:09:29,444 --> 00:09:31,196
Is there room?

144
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:43,792
Hey, brother...

145
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:45,585
Look at this place.

146
00:09:50,173 --> 00:09:53,677
One for all, all for one!
One for all, all for one!

147
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:07,107
Do you have any idea?

148
00:10:07,107 --> 00:10:08,400
Are you coming back from Rosa?

149
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,527
- We've just arrived.
- From Rosa?

150
00:10:10,527 --> 00:10:13,864
No, we just arrived in Floripa, at 7:00.

151
00:10:13,864 --> 00:10:15,574
You're back. How did it go there?

152
00:10:15,574 --> 00:10:17,993
- I'm back, guys.
- Do you remember Rosa?

153
00:10:17,993 --> 00:10:19,745
Oh, jeez...

154
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:21,997
- You're very hot, man.
- Thanks.

155
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:27,419
Really, I missed you.

156
00:10:27,419 --> 00:10:29,546
All she thinks about is you.

157
00:10:30,714 --> 00:10:34,217
She said, "I'll get there, and he'll be
with some girl, what am I gonna do?"

158
00:10:34,217 --> 00:10:36,136
You didn't know I was going to be here.

159
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,888
No, I didn't.

160
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:38,889
Bro...

161
00:10:46,188 --> 00:10:48,148
Really, are you here?

162
00:10:49,024 --> 00:10:50,359
Hey, hey...

163
00:10:50,359 --> 00:10:52,277
Come here.

164
00:11:02,704 --> 00:11:04,873
One more troublemaker from yesterday.

165
00:11:04,873 --> 00:11:07,000
- One more...
- He didn't do anything.

166
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,543
Don't even talk to me.

167
00:11:08,668 --> 00:11:09,795
He didn't do anything.

168
00:11:09,795 --> 00:11:12,130
- It wasn't him?
- It wasn't him, baby.

169
00:11:15,384 --> 00:11:17,886
Do they want a mess?

170
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:19,805
That's what they're going to have.

171
00:11:19,805 --> 00:11:22,682
We did start yesterday, and they saw it.
Luan said,

172
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:26,686
"We met six chicks outside.
We invited them to the afterparty."

173
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:29,398
I said,
"Okay, let's invite six guys, too."

174
00:11:29,398 --> 00:11:32,359
That's how things are going to be, get it?

175
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,819
I'm done being a fool.

176
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:37,155
'Cause they bring girls every time,
and we don't do anything.

177
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:39,282
We're polite, we're friendly.

178
00:11:39,282 --> 00:11:40,617
And so on...

179
00:11:40,617 --> 00:11:43,787
I'll bring somebody.
He's got to know how to control himself.

180
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,345
The boys were very stressed...

181
00:12:00,345 --> 00:12:03,098
Tay said that one of the boys teased her.

182
00:12:03,098 --> 00:12:05,559
So, Murilo was already
kind of, you know...

183
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:08,019
I apologize for whatever I did, okay?

184
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:12,566
I didn't think I was going
to meet you here, really.

185
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,215
Nath kissed him...

186
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:41,845
What is this guy doing here? I told you...

187
00:12:41,845 --> 00:12:45,599
I asked him to dance.
The box is yours and mine, too.

188
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:47,893
She's crazy...

189
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:49,311
You're right, you know?

190
00:12:49,311 --> 00:12:51,855
I'm right. I have the same right...

191
00:12:51,855 --> 00:12:54,149
But the respect... Lower your finger.

192
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:56,985
You invited women I didn't like
and had to put up with.

193
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:59,321
Whoever I want
is getting in the house.

194
00:12:59,321 --> 00:13:00,822
Okay. You're right.

195
00:13:00,822 --> 00:13:02,449
What are you going to do?

196
00:13:02,908 --> 00:13:04,743
Am I a jerk? I kiss whoever I want.

197
00:13:04,743 --> 00:13:07,621
From now on, that's how it's going to be.

198
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:09,206
Are you happy?

199
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:11,249
Hey...

200
00:13:12,334 --> 00:13:13,960
Broo, don't fight with me.

201
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,004
"Bro" my ass. I'm not your "bro."

202
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:17,589
- Murilo.
- I'm not your bro.

203
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:24,262
That's wrong, this guy threatened
me yesterday. If he stays, I leave.

204
00:13:24,262 --> 00:13:26,389
- What guy?
- This Vitor guy.

205
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:30,560
You're inviting guys, that's okay.
But this guy won't stay.

206
00:13:31,228 --> 00:13:32,938
I'm warning you.

207
00:13:36,191 --> 00:13:38,944
Tell him to leave,
or else there's going to be a mess.

208
00:13:41,029 --> 00:13:42,739
Can I tell you something?

209
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,282
You're all my brothers.

210
00:13:44,282 --> 00:13:46,826
I defend you if you want it.

211
00:13:46,826 --> 00:13:50,747
But, bro, I have to put up
with every girl. Every girl.

212
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,666
- Come to the bathroom.
- Just a sec.

213
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,501
I have to put up with every girl.

214
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:58,964
He did no harm, it's quite the opposite.
He was good to me because he's a partner.

215
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:00,840
Now I tell
the guy I like to leave?

216
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:03,635
- Weren't you with another one?
- Bro, regardless.

217
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:05,053
Bro, he won't stay.

218
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,304
This is wrong.

219
00:14:06,304 --> 00:14:08,431
He better behave
or I'm kicking his ass.

220
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:17,899
Hey... Let's go home.

221
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:24,906
- Look at the snipers...
- Look over here.

222
00:14:27,909 --> 00:14:30,161
No, I'm going to...

223
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,502
- Press pause.
- It was Nath who did the inviting. Damn.

224
00:14:37,502 --> 00:14:40,880
She's a troublemaker. He asked,
"What is this guy doing here?"

225
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,300
The box was theirs... She said,

226
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:44,968
"I invited him. The box is mine, too."

227
00:14:44,968 --> 00:14:48,555
She put that guy from the mess in the box,
together with the guy who...

228
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,557
And she even kissed him.

229
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,726
This chick is doing it on purpose...

230
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,811
Let's say I don't like Boca Rosa...

231
00:14:54,811 --> 00:14:58,273
I prefer girls with red lipstick,
or whatever.

232
00:14:58,273 --> 00:15:02,402
I almost fought with her, I called her
names. Are you gonna put her beside me?

233
00:15:02,402 --> 00:15:04,904
- On purpose?
- There's going to be trouble.

234
00:15:04,904 --> 00:15:07,282
You have to avoid that, man.
It's common sense.

235
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:08,700
Common sense.

236
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:11,328
Nath is hooking up with the guy
wearing the white shirt.

237
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:13,747
- I want Nath to fuck off.
- Oh, no.

238
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,582
Stop it now.

239
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,417
You don't listen to me.

240
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,877
That chick is a jerk.

241
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:21,421
Let me tell you something...

242
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:23,923
You're hooking up with some guy,
the friend of...

243
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,300
Pull yourself together...

244
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,927
You're hooking up with some guy...

245
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,095
Are you on her side?

246
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,097
You can't be with him...

247
00:15:31,097 --> 00:15:33,099
But she broke up with Ramon?

248
00:15:33,099 --> 00:15:34,809
But that's not the problem.

249
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,145
If she's hooking up or not...

250
00:15:37,145 --> 00:15:39,272
Nathália celebrated, did you feel that?

251
00:15:39,272 --> 00:15:41,941
The fire in her eyes...

252
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,818
She already knew...

253
00:15:43,818 --> 00:15:46,613
Fight in the house, the house isn't mine,
I'm leaving.

254
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:48,907
But fighting at the party
is so wrong, man.

255
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:51,618
Guys, fighting anywhere
is wrong, anywhere.

256
00:15:51,618 --> 00:15:54,788
I guess some people
go looking for trouble.

257
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:56,665
If the guy is jealous...

258
00:15:56,665 --> 00:15:58,750
He says,
"I'll have my girl wearing a skirt...

259
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,335
Wait...

260
00:16:00,335 --> 00:16:03,088
Back in the day,
we had funk party for this.

261
00:16:03,088 --> 00:16:06,549
- Really?
- No, we had side A, side B...

262
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,093
Wait a sec.

263
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:11,304
You go to a party...
You dress up with your girlfriend.

264
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,639
You go to pick a fight?

265
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,890
Me?

266
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:15,684
I don't even get out of the house...

267
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:18,395
If I go out, I'll go to a restaurant...

268
00:16:18,395 --> 00:16:20,188
There are jerks who go out to fight.

269
00:16:20,188 --> 00:16:22,023
I'd pay my bill and leave.

270
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,775
But they want to fight.

271
00:16:23,775 --> 00:16:26,778
The dudes are there...
They're waiting for something bad.

272
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:30,240
They want to fight.
It's make it or break it, honey.

273
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,033
She thinks she owns him.

274
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:35,662
It's not just about him,
it's about everybody.

275
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:37,664
Literally, she doesn't make up her mind.

276
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:41,126
She says one thing and does another.

277
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:42,961
She's batshit crazy.

278
00:16:42,961 --> 00:16:45,046
If you were in love with her...

279
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:47,215
- Girl, I don't fall in love.
- Never?

280
00:16:47,215 --> 00:16:50,468
The last time I fell in love I was 17.

281
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:53,346
I was cheated on, wrote a song,
been out there since then.

282
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:55,140
- Which song?
- Open bar.

283
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:59,477
He betrayed me with a boy who went
to school with me. He came to me and said,

284
00:16:59,477 --> 00:17:02,230
"I have to tell you something
because I'm your friend.

285
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,441
I'm hooking up with your boyfriend."

286
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:06,818
- And then...
- Just like that?

287
00:17:06,818 --> 00:17:08,445
And it's a song.

288
00:17:08,445 --> 00:17:10,280
DJ, hit it

289
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,906
I can see your panties.

290
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:13,658
Darling, it's just panties.

291
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:16,286
I'm all shaking here, for Christ's sake.

292
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:18,747
But, girl, you hook up with everybody.

293
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:21,875
Are you talking to me or to Bia?

294
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:24,669
- Both of you.
- You allow yourself meeting people.

295
00:17:24,669 --> 00:17:27,547
I allow myself... I'm an allowable person.

296
00:17:27,547 --> 00:17:29,424
I don't know if this word exists.

297
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:30,717
No, she does it, too.

298
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,219
Girl, we're here to live, right?

299
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:36,890
I think... His feelings are over.

300
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,185
We're talking too much. Press play.

301
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:42,020
If you spit on me again...

302
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:47,442
It's the last episode. If he spits
on me again, I'm going to... Fuck, man.

303
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:56,743
Gosh.

304
00:17:57,702 --> 00:18:00,705
At last, home.

305
00:18:11,716 --> 00:18:15,637
It's going to start, me and Bia.

306
00:18:15,637 --> 00:18:17,180
Nathália!

307
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:18,807
Everything is a mess.

308
00:18:18,807 --> 00:18:20,600
Me and you.

309
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:24,437
Let's play. Nath, pay them back.
We have to make him lose.

310
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:27,148
It was my turn, right?

311
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,900
High five. I'm here to work hard.

312
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:32,487
Just don't smell my neck.

313
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:34,280
We're coming.

314
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:37,784
Ouch, fuck, let's go, let's go.

315
00:18:37,784 --> 00:18:39,828
Look, be gentle at the party.

316
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:42,622
- I like charm.
- Hey, sweetheart?

317
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:45,333
She dumped the guy
and is now with the old one?

318
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,876
Is the revenge tonight?

319
00:18:46,876 --> 00:18:48,253
- Yeah...
- I'm terrified.

320
00:18:48,253 --> 00:18:52,006
She dumped the cute one and chose him.
She chose the annoying one?

321
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:53,508
She's a real fool.

322
00:18:55,093 --> 00:18:56,302
I'm terrified, girl.

323
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:58,721
That she dumped the other one
and chose the...

324
00:18:58,721 --> 00:19:00,223
Girl, she's a fool.

325
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:02,183
Girl, why?

326
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,769
I gave a lot of advice.

327
00:19:04,769 --> 00:19:06,980
Look at the cute one, so pretty,

328
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:10,942
so nice and quiet,
then she comes back to the annoying one.

329
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:12,235
She comes back to...

330
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:14,404
I told Nath...

331
00:19:25,456 --> 00:19:27,250
I'm going to get it for you.

332
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,628
Man, you're wasted.

333
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:34,632
- I'm going to go.
- Already?

334
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:36,509
- I'm beat.
- Okay...

335
00:19:37,427 --> 00:19:39,888
- Let's have drinks, okay?
- Sure, man...

336
00:19:39,888 --> 00:19:42,515
It was cool. It was cool seeing you.

337
00:19:43,975 --> 00:19:46,561
Take care. Go for it.

338
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:47,896
No problem, that's it.

339
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:50,064
- Are you leaving together?
- Yes, because...

340
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:53,192
You're leaving together.

341
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,320
You're leaving together.

342
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,863
I have to talk to Nath.

343
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,990
- You guys talk later.
- No, not later.

344
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,533
If you had enough time...

345
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:02,452
You came together,
you leave together.

346
00:20:02,452 --> 00:20:04,329
Chill out, yesterday...

347
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:06,831
You're leaving together.
I want to talk to Nath.

348
00:20:06,831 --> 00:20:08,708
We don't even live together.

349
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,168
- No.
- Nath, I'm leaving.

350
00:20:10,168 --> 00:20:12,670
Bia, I'm winning.

351
00:20:15,798 --> 00:20:18,259
I came to say goodbye.
It was good to see you.

352
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:21,012
Enjoy the last few days.

353
00:20:27,685 --> 00:20:30,730
Girl, you were a total fucking loser.

354
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,649
- She was, yesterday.
- What? Why?

355
00:20:32,649 --> 00:20:35,485
You have to make up your mind.
You brought the dude

356
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:37,362
to be with you, and abandoned him.

357
00:20:37,362 --> 00:20:38,863
- He left.
- You abandoned him

358
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,698
- to stalk Ramon.
- You ignored him.

359
00:20:40,698 --> 00:20:42,116
I was playing.

360
00:20:42,116 --> 00:20:43,868
No. You were stalking Ramon.

361
00:20:43,868 --> 00:20:45,036
You abandoned...

362
00:20:45,036 --> 00:20:48,122
And you said, "I don't want anything."

363
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:50,291
Come on, bro, fuck this.

364
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,126
I won't say anything anymore.

365
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:55,046
Don't ask for my opinion anymore.

366
00:20:55,046 --> 00:20:56,631
You two work things out.

367
00:20:56,631 --> 00:20:57,924
I won't say anything.

368
00:20:57,924 --> 00:21:02,261
But they ask for an opinion,
and what I think about...

369
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,390
Who asked for your opinion?
Did I ask for your opinion?

370
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,307
There it is.

371
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:08,142
Blondie is fighting for her.

372
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:09,060
Blondie.

373
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:13,106
Fuck, bro. I love you both
and I'll defend both of you.

374
00:21:13,106 --> 00:21:14,565
You have to make up your mind.

375
00:21:14,565 --> 00:21:17,151
- I did.
- It's an on-off relationship...

376
00:21:17,151 --> 00:21:20,154
They broke up today
because she said she wasn't sure.

377
00:21:20,154 --> 00:21:22,365
But then there's a party,
and he chases her.

378
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:23,950
Did I chase her tonight?

379
00:21:23,950 --> 00:21:25,201
It's not about tonight.

380
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:27,161
He didn't care about her tonight.

381
00:21:27,161 --> 00:21:29,622
- It's not about tonight.
- She was after him.

382
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:31,624
- Me?
- Yes, girl.

383
00:21:31,624 --> 00:21:33,418
You were after him here, girl.

384
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:36,295
Your boy left
because you said you were after Ramon.

385
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:38,006
Girl, we all saw it.

386
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:40,550
My boy, my ass. I don't have anyone.

387
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:42,385
You hooked up with him
and brought him.

388
00:21:42,385 --> 00:21:43,594
So what?

389
00:21:43,594 --> 00:21:45,888
He left because you were after
another guy.

390
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:47,056
Girl, it's...

391
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:48,891
I do whatever I want.

392
00:21:48,891 --> 00:21:49,934
Yes, you're single.

393
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:53,187
You said you wanted to bring him over.

394
00:21:53,187 --> 00:21:54,564
I do whatever I want.

395
00:21:54,564 --> 00:21:56,149
If I want to hook up with Ramon,

396
00:21:56,149 --> 00:22:01,029
- I'll do it. If I want to hook up with...
- Not with Ramon, not anymore.

397
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:35,772
I warned her many times.

398
00:22:35,772 --> 00:22:39,067
Then she got jealous,
and the gang got blamed.

399
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:40,526
She didn't hook up with me.

400
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:41,903
She dumped him for you.

401
00:22:41,903 --> 00:22:43,946
I didn't even understand.

402
00:22:43,946 --> 00:22:46,783
I won't treat her badly,
but I didn't hook up with her.

403
00:22:46,908 --> 00:22:48,576
She made a scene, man.

404
00:22:48,576 --> 00:22:50,203
Let her do it.

405
00:22:50,870 --> 00:22:52,163
It's over, bro.

406
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:57,418
I won't kick the chick out of bed,
but I won't do anything with her.

407
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:01,923
I don't have any more feelings, you know?

408
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:02,882
It's over, bro.

409
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:05,593
Yeah... I've already moved on...

410
00:23:06,803 --> 00:23:08,930
She brought the dude, then...

411
00:23:08,930 --> 00:23:11,182
Poor guy. He bounced, didn't he?

412
00:23:11,182 --> 00:23:14,393
He bounced, obviously.
He must've felt real bad again.

413
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:19,524
I feel like picking up this lamp
and throwing it in your face.

414
00:23:19,524 --> 00:23:21,400
But I was acting unconsciously.

415
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,694
I was drunk, like,

416
00:23:23,694 --> 00:23:26,781
- I can't control my feelings.
- I know we can't control...

417
00:23:26,781 --> 00:23:30,743
Girl, what Tay said was very real.
We have to stop saying...

418
00:23:30,743 --> 00:23:32,620
Don't say what you're doing,
just do it.

419
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:34,372
Didn't I do it?

420
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:37,500
Didn't I? I held his hand
and said, "Come to my box."

421
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,085
No, you said,

422
00:23:39,085 --> 00:23:42,463
"I'm going to bring him over.
I'm going to hook up with him.

423
00:23:42,463 --> 00:23:45,341
Fuck Ramon, I want Ramon
to fuck off." You got here,

424
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:46,884
"Ramon, let's play together!"

425
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:48,719
I didn't say I was playing with him.

426
00:23:48,719 --> 00:23:50,388
He asked me. I remember.

427
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:53,307
You should've said,
"No, I don't want it. I want to play

428
00:23:53,307 --> 00:23:56,477
- with Júlio."
- I know, right? Why didn't I say it?

429
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:59,939
He was going to be embarrassed.
He was going to be pissed off.

430
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,733
He'd say, "No, she didn't."
Can I say this?

431
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:06,529
He thinks... You do whatever he wants.
It's kind of true.

432
00:24:06,529 --> 00:24:08,364
You have to prove him wrong.

433
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:10,158
You don't have to say yes.

434
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:12,326
Yeah, you're learning. Little by little.

435
00:24:13,035 --> 00:24:14,078
Yeah.

436
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:17,206
- It's bad.
- It is.

437
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:19,542
Let's get in before the mosquitoes...

438
00:24:19,542 --> 00:24:22,545
- I'm already being attacked.
- Now they're attacking my vag.

439
00:24:48,404 --> 00:24:50,239
Let's go!

440
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:53,743
Everybody's happy.

441
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:56,162
Let's go, let's go, let's go

442
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:57,830
Today I'm going to party with my friends

443
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:29,779
- Fuck!
- Fuck, man!

444
00:25:29,779 --> 00:25:32,156
Let's drink!

445
00:25:34,659 --> 00:25:37,161
Let's get drunker than a bunch of...

446
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:12,613
It's ending.

447
00:26:21,122 --> 00:26:24,792
This is a fucking friendship. Thanks for
everything, for your friendship.

448
00:26:36,679 --> 00:26:38,889
You're happy, right?

449
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,934
Of course, bro. That's peace.

450
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:43,185
To me, this is awesome.

451
00:26:43,185 --> 00:26:45,479
- To me, too.
- And life, bro...

452
00:26:45,479 --> 00:26:47,773
We rule, man! We rule.

453
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:04,540
Where's your...

454
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,793
Headset? I'm asking, please.

455
00:27:21,766 --> 00:27:22,892
What's your name, boy?

456
00:27:24,393 --> 00:27:27,772
- Pedro, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

457
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:34,111
Look.

458
00:27:36,947 --> 00:27:39,492
Fuck, kiss him.

459
00:27:41,994 --> 00:27:43,371
Fuck, kiss him.

460
00:28:03,974 --> 00:28:07,019
Take her home, I'll pick her up there.

461
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:08,396
I'm waiting for you guys.

462
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:13,526
Guys, I have a message for you.

463
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:15,903
Ricardo sent a message.

464
00:28:15,903 --> 00:28:18,114
Time's up. We have to return the boat.

465
00:28:18,114 --> 00:28:20,449
- We have to leave now.
- Now?

466
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:22,368
I'd die if I had to work now.

467
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:23,994
Look at the sun!

468
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:29,208
Thanks, guys. Time's up.

469
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:32,920
Ricardo was real nice to lend us his boat.

470
00:28:34,088 --> 00:28:36,882
Hey, guys, thanks!

471
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:38,968
You're fucking awesome!

472
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:40,719
That's it.

473
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,096
Wonderful people.

474
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:43,222
That's it!

475
00:29:10,249 --> 00:29:12,042
Is this our house, bro?

476
00:29:13,544 --> 00:29:15,254
I'm wasted, bro! Fuck!

477
00:29:36,942 --> 00:29:39,904
I know you lived this intensely.

478
00:29:39,904 --> 00:29:43,908
Enjoy it. This is the party.
It's for you, guys.

479
00:29:46,118 --> 00:29:47,495
Let's go!

480
00:29:56,587 --> 00:29:58,047
Fuck!

481
00:29:58,047 --> 00:29:59,465
You're crazy!

482
00:29:59,465 --> 00:30:00,758
Come on, fuck you!

483
00:30:05,179 --> 00:30:06,222
How are you?

484
00:30:07,348 --> 00:30:08,474
What's up?

485
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:10,643
How are you?

486
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:29,537
You were right.

487
00:30:29,537 --> 00:30:31,872
Relax, relax. Let's enjoy it.

488
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:33,499
I'm more free.

489
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:39,463
This is a toast to you guys,

490
00:30:39,463 --> 00:30:42,800
the brothers I made.
I love you guys. I love you, my man.

491
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,593
I love you, stylish man.

492
00:30:44,593 --> 00:30:47,680
I love you, huge heart.
You're all my brothers.

493
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:49,473
That's it. To us!

494
00:30:59,358 --> 00:31:00,776
Call everybody.

495
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:02,778
Hey!

496
00:31:02,778 --> 00:31:05,239
Jão!

497
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:08,534
There's somebody you met on day one.

498
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:12,079
I want to tell you she's here.
Do you know who she is?

499
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:13,497
Joyce is over there!

500
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,626
Joyce, João. João, Joyce.

501
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,552
Hey, you became a caricature.

502
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:27,845
And it's identical.

503
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:30,556
Wow, what a beautiful girl...
I didn't know...

504
00:31:30,556 --> 00:31:32,349
I can't believe it!

505
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,041
May I have a minute of your attention,

506
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:02,463
towards the blue curtain, to welcome
tonight's great number...

507
00:32:09,637 --> 00:32:12,514
Hello, everybody!
Throw your hands in the air!

508
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:19,647
I think you know how to sing
this one, huh?

509
00:32:20,648 --> 00:32:23,734
My friend, Cantini. Go.

510
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:27,446
This is what life is all about

511
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:31,075
Making love every day

512
00:32:31,075 --> 00:32:34,870
Waking up naked with you by my side

513
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:38,123
I hope our love never turns into routine

514
00:32:38,123 --> 00:32:41,210
This is what life is all about

515
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:44,588
Making love every day

516
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:48,801
Waking up naked with you by my side

517
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:52,262
I hope our love never turns into routine

518
00:32:52,262 --> 00:32:55,349
This is what life is all about...

519
00:33:06,235 --> 00:33:09,321
This is what life is all about...

520
00:33:19,123 --> 00:33:21,166
What's up, Cantini, you go.

521
00:33:21,291 --> 00:33:24,545
She wants to date

522
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:27,715
And I know where this is going

523
00:33:27,715 --> 00:33:31,552
Maybe it's a good kiss
Maybe get goosebumps

524
00:33:31,552 --> 00:33:33,387
There's nobody home

525
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:37,224
I'm going to turn the stereo on
For her to dance

526
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:41,103
She'll look at me
She'll tease me, all horny

527
00:33:41,103 --> 00:33:45,065
Looks like a mirage
But it's a dirty thing

528
00:33:45,065 --> 00:33:48,318
This chick will live in my bedroom

529
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:51,405
This is what life is all about

530
00:33:51,405 --> 00:33:54,950
Making love every day

531
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:58,954
Waking up naked with you by my side

532
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:02,332
I hope our love never turns into routine

533
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:05,669
This is what life is all about

534
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:08,964
Making love every day

535
00:34:08,964 --> 00:34:12,968
Waking up naked with you by my side

536
00:34:12,968 --> 00:34:16,305
I hope our love never turns into routine

537
00:34:16,305 --> 00:34:19,683
This is what life is all about

538
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:23,228
Making love every day

539
00:34:23,228 --> 00:34:26,982
Waking up naked with you by my side

540
00:34:26,982 --> 00:34:30,360
I hope our love never turns into routine

541
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:33,280
Thanks, guys. Thanks, thanks!

542
00:36:00,284 --> 00:36:04,121
Everybody, may love always prevail.

543
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:20,762
- This could be better.
- But it's what we've got now...

544
00:36:27,019 --> 00:36:29,980
If you sleep with me tonight,
you're going to get more.

545
00:36:31,106 --> 00:36:33,025
- Now I'm going to enjoy it.
- Oh, yeah?

546
00:36:43,827 --> 00:36:45,871
Hey!

547
00:36:45,871 --> 00:36:49,124
Hey, no jealousy, my baby.
No jealousy, okay?

548
00:36:49,124 --> 00:36:51,126
Tonight I'm going to go wild.

549
00:37:09,227 --> 00:37:11,980
He told me she came over and hit on him.

550
00:37:12,105 --> 00:37:13,023
Fuck it.

551
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,316
I'm beating him up tonight.

552
00:37:17,611 --> 00:37:20,197
I'm going to throw this glass in his face.

553
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:21,990
While production was cleaning up,

554
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:24,409
Beatriz caught Luan with two women
on the lawn.

555
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:27,704
The scenes we're going to exhibit
are part of what happened afterwards.

556
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:31,291
Excuse me. Man...

557
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,210
Easy, girl.

558
00:37:33,210 --> 00:37:34,711
Easy, easy.

559
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:41,426
I want to talk to this chick.

560
00:37:42,302 --> 00:37:44,179
- This girl.
- Come with me, young lady.

561
00:37:44,179 --> 00:37:46,515
Wait...

562
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:48,183
Let's get inside.

563
00:37:48,183 --> 00:37:50,560
If this chick goes inside,
I'll kill her!

564
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,604
Don't go, don't get mad... She's there.

565
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:54,690
- Can I go in with them?
- No.

566
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:56,400
No. Luan, it will get ugly.

567
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,193
I'm going to take both of them.

568
00:37:58,193 --> 00:37:59,319
They're with me.

569
00:37:59,319 --> 00:38:01,989
They're laughing,
but they don't know what happened.

570
00:38:01,989 --> 00:38:03,115
No, it's not that...

571
00:38:03,115 --> 00:38:05,659
Fuck you!

572
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:09,079
Once again, you're a clown! Piece of shit!

573
00:38:09,079 --> 00:38:10,872
Piece of shit!

574
00:38:10,872 --> 00:38:12,249
Bastard.

575
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:14,793
How could this be?

576
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:18,630
- You're here to teach a lot of people.
- I can't take it.

577
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,007
You're good.

578
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:23,927
I can't take it, man. God, help me.

579
00:38:24,052 --> 00:38:26,555
Help me, help me.

580
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:28,890
We're here by your side.

581
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:30,684
A lot of people are by your side.

582
00:38:30,684 --> 00:38:32,436
Everybody is learning from you.

583
00:38:32,436 --> 00:38:34,187
Easy, go on. Let it out.

584
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,150
Let her breathe. Relax.

585
00:38:38,150 --> 00:38:40,777
Easy, we're here with you.

586
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:42,696
You're not alone.

587
00:38:42,904 --> 00:38:44,322
Breathe.

588
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,324
Inhale and exhale.

589
00:38:46,658 --> 00:38:48,243
Easy.

590
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:50,078
Everybody quiet.

591
00:38:50,454 --> 00:38:51,830
Easy, easy. Breathe.

592
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,623
Inhale and exhale.

593
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,004
Get my pants up.

594
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:03,133
Let's take her to the Tiger Room.

595
00:39:03,425 --> 00:39:05,010
Because it's warm there.

596
00:39:13,518 --> 00:39:14,853
Let's get in the pool?

597
00:39:14,853 --> 00:39:17,022
- Yes, skinny dipping.
- Okay, let's go.

598
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:21,693
If they step inside my house,
I'll kick their asses.

599
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:23,195
Hey, it wasn't Manu...

600
00:39:23,195 --> 00:39:25,280
Fuck it. They won't come in.

601
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,574
No woman will step foot in the house.

602
00:39:27,574 --> 00:39:29,076
If they come in...

603
00:39:29,076 --> 00:39:30,660
- Shut up, Taynara!
- Shut up!

604
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:31,787
You sexist!

605
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:33,872
- Shut up!
- You sexist!

606
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,416
Damn.

607
00:39:36,416 --> 00:39:40,128
Hey, bro. The two of them
have nothing to do with this.

608
00:39:40,128 --> 00:39:42,172
Nothing to do with it.

609
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:44,341
If you bring them over, I'll cut them!

610
00:39:44,341 --> 00:39:46,218
If you do it, I'll cut them!

611
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:47,886
What a crazy woman, bro.

612
00:39:47,886 --> 00:39:49,137
Relax.

613
00:39:49,137 --> 00:39:50,263
Crazy bitch.

614
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,390
Shut up, Nathália. Shut up!

615
00:39:52,516 --> 00:39:53,892
Respect her.

616
00:39:53,892 --> 00:39:55,894
Don't you talk
to my friend this way.

617
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,020
Crazy.

618
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:58,480
Are you crazy?

619
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:00,607
- I won't let you!
- Fuck off!

620
00:40:00,607 --> 00:40:03,527
You were the guy I liked the most
in this house.

621
00:40:03,527 --> 00:40:05,237
Learn to fuck.

622
00:40:05,237 --> 00:40:07,239
You're nothing but a puppet.

623
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:13,453
Manu and her friend
don't have anything...

624
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:15,038
But they're not supposed to come in.

625
00:40:15,038 --> 00:40:16,123
They won't come in.

626
00:40:16,123 --> 00:40:17,999
- Only Keila.
- Good.

627
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:21,461
We don't need more problems.

628
00:40:21,461 --> 00:40:23,505
Doesn't he have any common sense?

629
00:40:23,505 --> 00:40:25,549
Bia's passed out...

630
00:40:25,549 --> 00:40:27,926
If you guys don't control
yourselves, I will.

631
00:40:27,926 --> 00:40:29,970
No more sexists, not anymore.

632
00:40:29,970 --> 00:40:34,141
The whole season, I put up with him
insulting women. Not today!

633
00:40:34,141 --> 00:40:35,392
Listen to me.

634
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:37,602
"It's better you don't bring them over

635
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:40,063
because things are
getting ugly over there."

636
00:40:40,063 --> 00:40:42,566
- It's his character.
- He doesn't have one!

637
00:40:42,566 --> 00:40:43,859
It's okay.

638
00:40:43,859 --> 00:40:47,237
Warn them, because I'll pull
their hair out if they come in.

639
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:49,823
- Manu has nothing to do with it.
- Tell them to leave.

640
00:40:49,823 --> 00:40:52,534
She knows the situation.
If she comes to my house...

641
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:54,119
She's aware of all of this.

642
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:57,622
If she comes to my house,
I'm going to pull her hair out.

643
00:40:57,622 --> 00:40:59,124
- Keila can come.
- Okay.

644
00:40:59,124 --> 00:41:01,668
I've already asked them to leave.
I was polite.

645
00:41:01,668 --> 00:41:04,838
If she comes in, she'll be beaten.
Her and him.

646
00:41:04,838 --> 00:41:08,884
I'm going to put her on our bed.

647
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:19,936
You're going to be okay...

648
00:41:25,734 --> 00:41:28,278
Good. Good.

649
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:40,415
You're okay.

650
00:41:41,124 --> 00:41:42,959
Yes, leave her.

651
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:02,729
Jeez...

652
00:42:02,729 --> 00:42:04,856
Jeez, I was such a fool.

653
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:06,358
How can I be that stupid?

654
00:42:06,358 --> 00:42:07,901
Don't say that.

655
00:42:07,901 --> 00:42:11,196
He's two-faced, girl. He's two-faced.

656
00:42:11,947 --> 00:42:13,365
But how could I do that?

657
00:42:13,365 --> 00:42:16,117
You didn't know.
It just took too long to figure out.

658
00:42:16,785 --> 00:42:18,119
Oh, man...

659
00:42:18,119 --> 00:42:21,206
It's normal.
Anybody could've gone through this.

660
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:25,043
He really is a psycho
who pretends to be another person...

661
00:42:25,585 --> 00:42:28,255
He's insane. That's it, like...

662
00:42:28,255 --> 00:42:30,215
Anybody could've been in your position.

663
00:42:30,215 --> 00:42:33,760
We just found out
who he really is, when he drinks.

664
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,804
We've seen who he really is.

665
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:54,758
Hey, guys.

666
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:57,135
I'm going to need help this summer.

667
00:43:57,761 --> 00:43:59,512
Who wants to come back?

668
00:44:05,435 --> 00:44:07,395
- Fuck...
- Did you see João's face?

669
00:44:07,395 --> 00:44:08,605
He didn't know where...

670
00:44:08,605 --> 00:44:09,939
"I need help this summer."

671
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:11,399
"Who wants to come back?"

672
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:13,151
There's going to be a recap.

673
00:44:13,151 --> 00:44:15,236
They're going to stay at that house again.

674
00:44:15,236 --> 00:44:16,363
Invite me...

675
00:44:16,363 --> 00:44:18,573
Did you see João's face when he woke up?

676
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:20,158
I wonder if can handle it.

677
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:22,077
Another 30 days of booze?

678
00:44:22,077 --> 00:44:23,495
He woke up and said, "Wow!

679
00:44:23,495 --> 00:44:25,121
"Am I at Carol's place?

680
00:44:25,121 --> 00:44:26,331
-"What happened?
- Fuck!

681
00:44:26,331 --> 00:44:28,875
-"Am I going to play video games?"
- Fuck!

682
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:30,585
The dude woke up in...

683
00:44:30,585 --> 00:44:32,170
Would you come back?

684
00:44:32,170 --> 00:44:34,172
- Of course I would.
- What about you...

685
00:44:34,172 --> 00:44:38,051
Seeing that not only is there a house
where eight people

686
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:40,428
fight all the time, but they get along...

687
00:44:40,428 --> 00:44:42,680
They fight and sort things out.

688
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:44,432
It's like a family.

689
00:44:44,432 --> 00:44:46,351
Do you know what I think the key is?

690
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:48,978
It's the fact that there's no prize.

691
00:44:48,978 --> 00:44:51,022
- Nobody is competing.
- Yeah.

692
00:44:51,022 --> 00:44:53,817
Nobody is competing.
That's the catch about this show.

693
00:44:53,817 --> 00:44:56,986
- It's about enjoying. Nobody's competing.
- That's true.

694
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:58,863
That's another thing, too.

695
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:02,450
One fucking awesome thing is...
It's much bigger than a show because...

696
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:06,079
When you watch a series,
you learn a lesson.

697
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:07,705
They also learned something.

698
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:10,375
We learned a lesson, but they also did.

699
00:45:10,375 --> 00:45:13,086
They showed all kinds of feeling...

700
00:45:13,086 --> 00:45:14,212
I like this.

701
00:45:14,212 --> 00:45:17,424
Acknowledged their mistakes, gratitude,

702
00:45:17,424 --> 00:45:21,761
love, hate, too, anger...
Everything was all mixed up.

703
00:45:21,761 --> 00:45:23,805
It ended up like this.

704
00:45:23,805 --> 00:45:26,683
Didn't you hear the boss,
"I'll need help this summer.

705
00:45:26,683 --> 00:45:29,727
- Who's coming back?"
- Every good show ends up like this.

706
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:32,063
They go home,
think about it and come back...

707
00:45:32,063 --> 00:45:33,857
There's going to be a lot of seasons.

708
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:36,025
- I'm shocked.
- I'm shocked.

709
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:39,571
- Fix me, Carol, I'm shocked.
- I'm looking forward to the summer.

710
00:45:43,408 --> 00:45:44,909
Beautiful!

711
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:48,413
I want a cup of chocolate milk, fuck!
