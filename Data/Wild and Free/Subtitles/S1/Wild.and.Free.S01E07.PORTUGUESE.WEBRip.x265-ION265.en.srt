1
00:00:15,266 --> 00:00:18,853
- Hello there... Guys, who cooked today?
- Me.

2
00:00:18,853 --> 00:00:21,605
I do the laundry and I iron,
but Pabllo cooks.

3
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:22,982
- That's the best.
- Hi.

4
00:00:22,982 --> 00:00:24,024
Hi, Bia.

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:26,527
- You're welcome.
- So cute. Oh, girlfriend.

6
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,612
Carol, I feel like banging you today.

7
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:30,781
- Oh, my God.
- I hate it!

8
00:00:31,991 --> 00:00:34,577
Remember that man who says,
"Is this to be eaten or seen?"

9
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:36,829
I'm to be seen.

10
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:39,206
Titto's jokes are the best.

11
00:00:39,331 --> 00:00:42,626
- He's like an old uncle!
- I like Titto's jokes.

12
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,924
Guys, we're back to watch
Episode 4 of Floripa Beach House.

13
00:00:48,924 --> 00:00:52,428
Last episode ended with Murilo's guests
kicked out after fighting with girls.

14
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:53,846
- That was tense.
- Was that fair?

15
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:55,973
That's the very definition of trouble.

16
00:00:55,973 --> 00:00:58,476
I felt bad for those girls.

17
00:00:58,476 --> 00:01:00,102
Everything was tense...

18
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:02,855
If they went there,
they were expecting something to happen.

19
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:05,900
Something good, not being kicked out.
"Give me my flip-flops back!"

20
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,943
No, but... That flip-flop moment,

21
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:09,737
when she threw them...
She wanted something.

22
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:13,824
I thought Murilo didn't take them
because he liked them. He was teasing.

23
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,159
Is that what you think?

24
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,118
- Absolutely.
- I'm sure.

25
00:01:16,118 --> 00:01:18,996
When he realized it didn't work,
he walked away...

26
00:01:18,996 --> 00:01:20,664
They had dinner and didn't pay for it...

27
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:22,958
They had dinner for free and took an Uber.

28
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,084
I want friends like those.

29
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,587
He noticed she didn't bring
anybody with her and said,

30
00:01:26,587 --> 00:01:30,174
"Tay is okay with this,
I'm gonna send these girls home,

31
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:32,593
I'm gonna hit on Tay today, then..."

32
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:33,594
I think he imagined...

33
00:01:33,594 --> 00:01:35,304
...embarrassed about that situation.

34
00:01:35,304 --> 00:01:37,973
You got to remember
that Floripa Beach House is a show

35
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:39,433
that follows eight friends,

36
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:43,771
and they are not actors.
There's no script, nobody influences this.

37
00:01:43,771 --> 00:01:45,356
Anything can happen.

38
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:46,315
No rules.

39
00:01:46,315 --> 00:01:47,483
It's real.

40
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:48,651
Sometimes I can't believe it.

41
00:01:48,651 --> 00:01:50,903
When I saw the flip-flops,
I said, "This is a soap opera."

42
00:01:50,903 --> 00:01:51,987
It looks a lot like...

43
00:01:51,987 --> 00:01:55,115
I loved that look on her face,
"I found my flip-flops."

44
00:01:55,115 --> 00:01:56,325
- It was really good.
- I loved it!

45
00:01:56,325 --> 00:01:57,409
"I'm gonna kill this girl."

46
00:01:57,409 --> 00:01:59,286
However, she had food on her hands.

47
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:00,329
That's true.

48
00:02:00,329 --> 00:02:03,165
Do you think he was gonna bring them
if there was no trouble?

49
00:02:03,165 --> 00:02:04,250
On that table there?

50
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:05,292
If everybody had luck,

51
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:06,919
do you think he was gonna
bring those girls?

52
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:07,837
He was gonna fuck them.

53
00:02:07,837 --> 00:02:08,838
He was gonna bring...

54
00:02:08,963 --> 00:02:11,423
I think he'd stall and wouldn't go. Yeah.

55
00:02:11,423 --> 00:02:13,133
- I think he would.
- He wouldn't.

56
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,510
- He would do the honors.
- No.

57
00:02:14,510 --> 00:02:16,846
He wouldn't because
I think those two girls

58
00:02:16,846 --> 00:02:18,055
wouldn't hook up.

59
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:20,140
- He would if they hooked up with him.
- Sure.

60
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,560
I'm dying to watch Episode 4. May I?

61
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,644
- Let's do this...
- Please.

62
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:25,020
Great, I'm all set. Go.

63
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:58,012
FLORIPA BEACH HOUSE

64
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:15,779
Did you find it cool? Did you like it?

65
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,323
Jeez, a lot.

66
00:03:17,823 --> 00:03:21,076
It was really cool, that moment
when you got to the party, bro.

67
00:03:22,036 --> 00:03:25,456
I saw you and said to Murilo,

68
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:28,375
"Look at that chick in the middle."

69
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,294
Then, all of a sudden, you came in.

70
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,755
At the right time.

71
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:38,052
Blondie and João
are not friends with benefits anymore.

72
00:03:39,637 --> 00:03:41,722
I don't have anything to do...

73
00:03:45,351 --> 00:03:46,727
She wants to keep doing it.

74
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,103
Yeah.

75
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,565
Only when I don't have anything to do.

76
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:52,900
You see, Ramon?

77
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:55,778
But I'm not like this.

78
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:59,281
Now he's playing hard to get. There it is!

79
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,867
Do you want me to hook up with you
when you have nothing to do?

80
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:03,410
- No, I...
- That's it.

81
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:05,120
When you have nothing to do...

82
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,122
- Yeah...
- We use each other.

83
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,043
Yeah, right.

84
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:20,970
Bunch of boozers!

85
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:24,264
Let's get ready,
we're gonna go for drinks in one hour.

86
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,933
The party is about to get started!

87
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:30,229
One hour, one hour...
In one hour, we leave.

88
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:31,689
Let's drink again.

89
00:04:47,788 --> 00:04:49,498
Thanks for everything, you know?

90
00:04:49,498 --> 00:04:50,791
Thanks for coming.

91
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,292
We'll meet at the party.

92
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,168
- See you.
- Later.

93
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:03,846
Everybody ready?

94
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:04,847
Everybody ready!

95
00:05:04,847 --> 00:05:06,598
- Let's go, the bus is here.
- What?

96
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,142
Is everybody alive?

97
00:05:08,142 --> 00:05:09,226
I'm well again.

98
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:11,437
Everybody's ready for more.

99
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:13,022
What about the champagne?

100
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:14,815
No champagne. No champagne today.

101
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:17,818
Drinking champagne
is the same thing as drinking the stars.

102
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,748
I'm gonna do the lucky lick, now.
Excuse me.

103
00:05:30,748 --> 00:05:32,541
Wait, let me see. Sit there.

104
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:34,293
But I want to be lucky.

105
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:53,020
I give you...

106
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,355
Oxygen.

107
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:56,857
- Our place for partying.
- That's it!

108
00:05:56,857 --> 00:05:57,941
Oh, fuck!

109
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,157
What a wonderful place, guys.

110
00:06:12,664 --> 00:06:14,917
I wanna make a toast
to this wonderful place.

111
00:06:14,917 --> 00:06:17,669
Look at this! Everybody together...

112
00:06:17,669 --> 00:06:18,879
- Hey...
- That's it.

113
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:22,216
Let's toast because Joãozinho had sex.

114
00:06:38,816 --> 00:06:41,693
Look at this party, man.
Fucking awesome, right?

115
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:43,821
Amazing.

116
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:45,114
- One of the best.
- Rad.

117
00:06:45,531 --> 00:06:48,117
That's because it's near the sea...

118
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:49,535
It's the best thing in the world.

119
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,957
Bro, for me... I live on the beach,
Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday...

120
00:06:54,957 --> 00:06:56,416
When it's possible in Rio.

121
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,336
I missed this, you know?
To be in contact with nature.

122
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:00,504
We're privileged, right?

123
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,132
Look at this, man!

124
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,885
Fuck, man...

125
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,720
How long since you've been here?

126
00:07:09,972 --> 00:07:11,807
How long haven't I been here?

127
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:15,352
Man, about ten years.

128
00:07:15,352 --> 00:07:16,562
Fuck!

129
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:17,938
I swear to you.

130
00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,314
- That's fucked up.
- I swear.

131
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:20,899
You've been on a beach in Rio?

132
00:07:20,899 --> 00:07:23,610
Yes, bro.
I went to a church retreat in Rio.

133
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,987
Can you believe it? Fuck.

134
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:26,613
That's old stuff. Yeah...

135
00:07:26,613 --> 00:07:29,908
Things over there, you know?

136
00:07:29,908 --> 00:07:31,869
I remember we all...

137
00:07:31,869 --> 00:07:33,328
We went for a ride in Rio.

138
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:34,663
In Copacabana, bro.

139
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:37,666
It was very cloudy.
Still, we enjoyed it a lot.

140
00:07:37,666 --> 00:07:38,667
Beaches are something...

141
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:40,878
That was the only time I was on a beach.

142
00:07:40,878 --> 00:07:42,796
- Beaches...
- Now's the second time.

143
00:07:43,422 --> 00:07:45,048
Hey, Murilo!

144
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:47,634
- Let's go upstairs.
- Okay. Let's go upstairs.

145
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,052
This is relaxing...

146
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:51,471
Just to be here, man.

147
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,599
Very unusual for me.

148
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:21,460
To us, the most beautiful, wonderful,
kindhearted women I've ever seen...

149
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:22,794
Yes... We are real.

150
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:24,087
Yes... And polite.

151
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,590
- Polite, remember this...
- Thanks for everything.

152
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,091
Here's to friendship, girls.

153
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,683
I got a lighter, baby.

154
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,436
Lighter. Are you nuts, bro?

155
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:41,104
I said, "Baby."

156
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:43,148
Don't talk like that. Get out of here!

157
00:08:43,148 --> 00:08:44,942
Nath, come here and give me a hug.

158
00:08:44,942 --> 00:08:46,443
Come here.

159
00:08:46,443 --> 00:08:47,736
Let's be friends.

160
00:08:51,073 --> 00:08:53,909
I'm just stealing your... I'm warming up.

161
00:08:55,285 --> 00:08:56,912
It's getting... It's far.

162
00:08:56,912 --> 00:08:58,330
Yeah... It's touching you.

163
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:02,834
When I want you,
it wants to say hello to you.

164
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:06,171
Stay put, fuck! Stop it!

165
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:07,881
It doesn't work when it has to.

166
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:11,051
Yeah? It'll work tonight, no?

167
00:09:11,635 --> 00:09:14,513
What is this, bro? You're tripping.

168
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:16,056
Come on!

169
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:23,522
- Let's talk?
- Okay.

170
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:26,942
Aren't you gonna talk to me?

171
00:09:28,652 --> 00:09:29,611
Are you mad at me?

172
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:32,990
- Why?
- Go where?

173
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,366
Where do you wanna talk?

174
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:36,118
- There.
- What?

175
00:09:45,502 --> 00:09:46,795
Oh, fuck!

176
00:09:46,795 --> 00:09:49,006
Hey, I'm very cold, I swear...
It's too cold.

177
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,258
I'm shaking.
I'm trying to drink, but I can't.

178
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:54,261
Bro, I got out of there
because something annoyed me.

179
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:55,429
What?

180
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:58,265
Didn't you see Ramon slapping my face?

181
00:09:58,265 --> 00:10:00,183
Slap your face?

182
00:10:00,183 --> 00:10:01,476
But he was messing with you?

183
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:03,312
Exactly, he was messing, but...

184
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:05,480
I can't accept that, even if he was.

185
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,108
I got out of there so I wouldn't hit him.

186
00:10:08,859 --> 00:10:11,069
I can accept he kissed another girl...

187
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:12,404
Bro, we're not committed.

188
00:10:12,404 --> 00:10:15,115
He can kiss whoever he wants,
I can kiss whoever I want...

189
00:10:15,115 --> 00:10:16,116
Was it good? It's over...

190
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:17,534
Every jack to his trade,

191
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,620
- but I can't accept some things.

192
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,581
- I'm shocked.
- Get it? I can't accept that.

193
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:23,749
I got really pissed.

194
00:10:23,749 --> 00:10:28,754
I got really pissed
and it really bothered me. I want to...

195
00:10:29,921 --> 00:10:31,048
You want to stay away.

196
00:10:31,048 --> 00:10:32,466
Exactly. I don't want him.

197
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:40,891
What is it?

198
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:42,434
You slapped me in the face.

199
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:43,602
Come on, Nath.

200
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,604
I don't care if you're messing.
Don't do that.

201
00:10:45,604 --> 00:10:48,440
- Did I slap you hard?
- I didn't like it. I got pissed.

202
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,025
Would you like it if I did it to you?

203
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,860
You did that to me many times.

204
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,445
You hit me three times in the gut.

205
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:54,988
Three times, remember?

206
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,449
Should a man slap a woman in the face?

207
00:10:57,449 --> 00:10:58,909
You of all people?

208
00:10:58,909 --> 00:11:01,620
Okay. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to hurt you...

209
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,830
I know you didn't. I know. That's why...

210
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,999
- Not in the least.
- I know you didn't.

211
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,335
- You know I didn't hit hard.
- I know.

212
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,628
I won't mess with you anymore.

213
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:10,712
Don't do that again.

214
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:12,422
I won't mess with you anymore.

215
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:15,092
You can mess with whoever...

216
00:11:30,565 --> 00:11:32,109
Come here, dude.

217
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:34,236
The dance floor is rocking right now.

218
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:36,071
And it's fucking cold.

219
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:37,489
Let's have a great time!

220
00:11:52,587 --> 00:11:54,673
If I hooked up with him...

221
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:56,675
He's a pain in the ass today.

222
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:59,594
I can't even talk to you,
and he comes to bother me.

223
00:12:00,512 --> 00:12:03,807
I can't even talk to you,
and he comes to bother me.

224
00:12:03,807 --> 00:12:06,059
Fuck. No.

225
00:12:06,810 --> 00:12:08,061
Fuck. No?

226
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,731
We were joking around, talking,
and he slapped me in the face.

227
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:15,485
I thought about hitting him back
at that moment.

228
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:16,987
Anyway. I bounced...

229
00:12:16,987 --> 00:12:18,530
Fuck, you're still into him?

230
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,783
Come on, Nathália.

231
00:12:23,118 --> 00:12:24,661
Jesus Christ.

232
00:12:24,661 --> 00:12:26,788
Luan is defending me.

233
00:12:26,788 --> 00:12:28,915
I'm defending you. Fuck, man.

234
00:12:39,718 --> 00:12:40,969
Thanks.

235
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,180
Welcome to our bus.

236
00:12:44,598 --> 00:12:45,932
This is it!

237
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:54,566
Jesus Christ, man. Jesus Christ.

238
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,698
Is everything okay in here?

239
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,667
Why are you looking at her this way?

240
00:13:12,667 --> 00:13:15,170
Leave her alone, you piece of shit.

241
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:17,380
You don't even know
what I'm talking about.

242
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,548
- Fuck you.
- Motherfucker!

243
00:13:18,548 --> 00:13:20,509
- Luan, stop it.
- Fuck you, man.

244
00:13:20,509 --> 00:13:22,052
- Get out of there.
- Luan, stop it.

245
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:23,553
Get out of there. He soaked Thais.

246
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,055
Luan, stop... Don't do this.

247
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,061
He soaked everybody in here,

248
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:32,896
soaked everybody but me.

249
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,524
You piece of shit. Fuck you.

250
00:13:35,524 --> 00:13:37,984
Come on, man.

251
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:40,737
Hey, Luan... For Christ's sake, Luan.

252
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:41,905
It takes four men to stop me.

253
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:46,576
Can't you deal with me on your own?

254
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:48,495
You can't take me out yourself.

255
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,622
I wanna see you dealing with me.

256
00:13:51,665 --> 00:13:53,667
Zip it!

257
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:55,418
Can you just shut up?

258
00:13:55,752 --> 00:13:58,588
It's over.

259
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,784
Maybe we can talk? Can we talk?

260
00:14:29,828 --> 00:14:31,204
I'm with you.

261
00:14:31,746 --> 00:14:32,831
Now's not the best time.

262
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:35,584
Didn't you want to talk yesterday
when we were getting on the bus?

263
00:14:35,584 --> 00:14:37,961
- Let's talk now.
- We've already talked.

264
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:39,713
Want to talk again?

265
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,340
I was drunk.

266
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,259
There's no more need.

267
00:14:44,259 --> 00:14:46,011
Or else I'm gonna fuck things up.

268
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:50,307
You're thinking bad things about me.

269
00:14:52,142 --> 00:14:54,102
I don't know what to tell you.

270
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,062
Okay, I'm wrong. Go with them...

271
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,398
No, no... I'm not saying you're wrong...

272
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,400
I never said that.

273
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,361
I'm just trying to say
that you're better than this.

274
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:05,363
But you don't see it.

275
00:15:05,363 --> 00:15:07,282
You're not wrong. Everybody knows...

276
00:15:07,282 --> 00:15:09,242
No... I don't want anybody to see it.

277
00:15:09,242 --> 00:15:10,827
- Enough.
- So... But...

278
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:13,830
Enough, Bia, please.

279
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,000
Go with those girls,
leave me alone for a little bit.

280
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:18,668
Okay?

281
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:28,928
Then I said, "That's right."

282
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:31,514
I went to talk to Tay.

283
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:33,475
- At that time you joined Tay?
- That...

284
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,393
Yes. Tay.

285
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:36,978
That's all.

286
00:15:37,687 --> 00:15:40,857
Everybody asked me, "Are you okay?"
I said, "Yep."

287
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:43,276
- Then Luan asked...
- After we talked?

288
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:47,197
Yep. After I said to Luan...

289
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:49,741
What we want is different from what I...

290
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:52,160
Honey, no. You got to...
No, it's not feel...

291
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,412
I don't love you,
I'm not in love with you!

292
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,122
Saying you love or not is a feeling.

293
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,500
No... I don't love you.
I'm not in love with you.

294
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,212
I respect you.
You don't know how to respect me.

295
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:05,423
Everybody is pissed, not only me.

296
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:08,218
I think I'm the least pissed.

297
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,095
Everybody is watching what you do.

298
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,681
The way you treat me, the way you act.

299
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:17,102
You don't have to agree.

300
00:16:17,102 --> 00:16:21,022
If you are like this, you say,
"This is me.

301
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:23,566
I'm always going to do this."

302
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:25,777
Now's not the time.

303
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:28,405
You have to man up.

304
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:30,865
You're right about this.

305
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:32,909
No, I'm right about everything.

306
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:35,745
- I'm right about everything.
- Everything you're saying.

307
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:38,039
I'm sorry, but I'm right about everything.

308
00:16:38,039 --> 00:16:40,250
I wish you well,
I don't wanna see you sad.

309
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,543
I know, me, too.

310
00:16:41,543 --> 00:16:44,546
I'm sorry to tell you this.

311
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:48,425
I'm sorry, but, to me,
he's a man and you're a kid.

312
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:50,760
When a man realizes
someone is acting like a kid,

313
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,178
they take someone's side.

314
00:16:52,178 --> 00:16:54,472
- I'm sorry to tell you this.
- It's okay...

315
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:58,351
But, to me, today...
Today he's the greatest.

316
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,310
That's fair.

317
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,021
- 'Cause he's got nothing to do with this.
- It's fair.

318
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,315
He's got nothing to do with both of us.

319
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:05,734
And he defended me.

320
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:07,569
I agree. That's true.

321
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,657
And you also could be... defending me.

322
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,325
I didn't behave well.

323
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:15,660
No, bro.

324
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,871
I wish I'd never met you. I swear.

325
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:21,541
That's it.

326
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:28,089
I'm hungry. Let's go.

327
00:17:43,438 --> 00:17:45,690
Come eat, man. Sit, let's eat.

328
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:50,028
Look at this tasty food I made you guys,
one big plate.

329
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:53,406
I love you, my friend, you know?

330
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:56,117
You, too, my friend.

331
00:17:56,117 --> 00:17:59,162
I'm going to miss those hot nights
in the Tiger Room.

332
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:00,872
I'm going to take over now.

333
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,294
- Do you want some salad?
- Yes.

334
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:08,463
We'll talk later.

335
00:18:08,463 --> 00:18:10,256
I don't want to talk to you.
Don't look at me.

336
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:11,257
No problem.

337
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:40,370
What do you think about that slap?

338
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:41,496
- Bianca, talk to me.
- I...

339
00:18:41,496 --> 00:18:43,873
I thought it was abusive...

340
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,250
I'd slap him back.

341
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:48,336
Guys, that depends on the vibe...
He wasn't aggressive...

342
00:18:48,336 --> 00:18:50,004
- I thought...
- That vibe...

343
00:18:50,004 --> 00:18:50,964
What do you think?

344
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:52,549
Maybe that happened when they had sex,

345
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:54,050
he thought he could do that to her.

346
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:55,510
That that could happen at the bar.

347
00:18:55,510 --> 00:18:56,469
In the bedroom, it's fine.

348
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,012
She didn't like it.

349
00:18:58,012 --> 00:18:59,347
She didn't like the slap.

350
00:18:59,347 --> 00:19:00,640
She didn't like it.

351
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,058
Nobody likes it, right, guys?

352
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:04,310
But there's a pet peeve in a couple...

353
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,312
- He just can't beat her.
- But she's wrong.

354
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,147
He took a lot of makeup off of her face.

355
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:09,274
She didn't like it.

356
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:10,275
I'm not going to lie.

357
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:12,610
One time, when I was talking,
I was getting angry,

358
00:19:12,610 --> 00:19:14,779
messing around. 'Cause I'm ridiculous.

359
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,906
Not ridiculous. You're authentic.

360
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,199
- Look...
- Hit me again.

361
00:19:18,199 --> 00:19:20,243
I thought you were going to hit me.

362
00:19:20,243 --> 00:19:22,745
A dick spanking is very different
from a real spanking.

363
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:25,415
For Christ's sake.
What does that have to do with it?

364
00:19:25,415 --> 00:19:26,583
It doesn't give him the right...

365
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:29,377
She picked a fight
and then filed her nails.

366
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:31,504
It was a serious mistake, Nath.

367
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,089
Filing her nails
and eating chicken.

368
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:35,049
Big mistake, it was huge.

369
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:37,260
Luan wants to play the hero.

370
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,429
- What?
- I think he wants to play the hero.

371
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:42,849
Do you think that was all about one issue
or he has feelings for her?

372
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,058
No...

373
00:19:44,058 --> 00:19:45,310
Absolutely.

374
00:19:45,310 --> 00:19:46,311
He likes her.

375
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:48,104
I think he knew he'd win there...

376
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,606
Luan, I have nothing against you.

377
00:19:49,606 --> 00:19:50,732
If you have an issue,

378
00:19:50,732 --> 00:19:52,984
you just solve it,
you don't cause another one.

379
00:19:52,984 --> 00:19:54,277
He wanted to fight and show off...

380
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:55,820
He'd look good.

381
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:58,740
You have to remember...
I think he has feelings for Nath.

382
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,825
Do you remember
he took care of her in the bedroom?

383
00:20:00,825 --> 00:20:02,243
- Yes...
- Remember that?

384
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,495
- I don't agree.
- He took care of her.

385
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:07,916
He went there and got mad,
he was jealous of him.

386
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,250
He went there and defended her.

387
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:12,629
I wonder if he's just a good friend
or if he has ulterior motives.

388
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:16,132
But I don't know if
he has feelings for Nath...

389
00:20:16,132 --> 00:20:19,135
- I think Nath may have feelings for him.
- For him. Really?

390
00:20:19,135 --> 00:20:20,762
I wonder if they're swinging
in that house.

391
00:20:20,762 --> 00:20:21,721
Did you hear her?

392
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,140
- She said, "Dude is awesome."
-"He's a man, you're a kid."

393
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,850
"He's a man, you're a kid.

394
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:26,851
He was awesome."

395
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:29,103
Talking to her was wrong.

396
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:30,855
She told him about the slap...

397
00:20:30,855 --> 00:20:32,440
- Yeah...
- No, it was wrong...

398
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,610
She didn't admit to him
what he'd said to her.

399
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:39,614
It was wrong to apologize
and leave unfinished business.

400
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:42,825
After everything was settled,
she apologized to him.

401
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:44,035
He said, "I won't mess with you."

402
00:20:44,035 --> 00:20:46,955
She talked to Luan at the party.

403
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,458
Luan was also wrong
because he didn't talk to Ramon.

404
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:52,126
He didn't have a straight talk with Ramon.

405
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:53,294
Everybody is wrong.

406
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:54,212
What happened?

407
00:20:54,212 --> 00:20:55,421
Exactly, exactly...

408
00:20:55,421 --> 00:20:58,800
- How many times we've been through this.
- Sure.

409
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,677
...something that's totally different.

410
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:02,804
- Yeah...
- That happens a lot.

411
00:21:02,804 --> 00:21:05,723
I had a lot of trouble like this.
I thought I was completely right.

412
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:08,142
Then you know the truth
and feel embarrassed,

413
00:21:08,142 --> 00:21:10,395
- and you say, "Fuck, I'm sorry."
- Yeah...

414
00:21:10,395 --> 00:21:12,897
But... That's why I talk.

415
00:21:12,897 --> 00:21:15,316
You can't say something
if you're not sure...

416
00:21:15,316 --> 00:21:17,402
Man, but... In the heat of the moment,

417
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:19,195
you're stressed out,

418
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:20,780
you don't want to postpone it.

419
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,824
That's why you have to talk.

420
00:21:22,824 --> 00:21:25,952
That's what I said last week.
Everybody was emotional, drunk.

421
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:27,495
Here, we are okay. It's different.

422
00:21:27,495 --> 00:21:29,372
And it's strategic here.

423
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:31,666
Let's see if they'll talk it out
or keep fighting?

424
00:21:31,666 --> 00:21:34,377
- I think there's going to be trouble.
- Yes.

425
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,024
- My brother.
- Good morning.

426
00:21:58,276 --> 00:22:00,069
- Is everything all right?
- Yes.

427
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:03,990
You saw the girl riding a SUP over there?
A stand-up paddle?

428
00:22:03,990 --> 00:22:05,700
- Do you want to go?
- Sure.

429
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,326
Let's go, then. Let's go SUP?

430
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,369
You're crazy, man.

431
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:12,165
Let's take a spin. Let's go SUP?

432
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:15,418
I'm going to get the SUP boards
with Ramon.

433
00:22:15,418 --> 00:22:16,461
- Really?
- Yeah...

434
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:17,628
That's great.

435
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:23,760
- Fuck...
- Cool, I'm on my way.

436
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,219
Let's go, we'll be right back.

437
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:26,471
Let's go together. See ya.

438
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,474
- Look at this ride!
- Let's go.

439
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:39,233
Amazing car, man.

440
00:23:07,095 --> 00:23:08,554
Calling...

441
00:23:10,181 --> 00:23:13,851
Those who humble
themselves will be exalted.

442
00:23:15,603 --> 00:23:16,896
Have you gone... SUP?

443
00:23:17,021 --> 00:23:19,816
- Have you ever ridden a stand-up paddle?
- Yeah, I did.

444
00:23:19,816 --> 00:23:22,151
- Race you later?
- Sure.

445
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:23,528
That's insane! Yeah...

446
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:24,612
Are we going to be in trouble?

447
00:23:24,612 --> 00:23:26,072
We'll fall flat, bro.

448
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:28,032
We'll fall flat, but let's do it.

449
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:30,243
Bro, I think it's over there.

450
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:32,495
I wonder if they have SUP boards
over here.

451
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,972
- Hello?
- Hi.

452
00:23:50,972 --> 00:23:52,723
Look who's there.

453
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:54,308
Are you okay?

454
00:23:54,308 --> 00:23:56,477
I am, what about you? How is everything?

455
00:23:56,602 --> 00:23:59,188
Things are great,

456
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:02,608
but I need my crush over here, right?

457
00:24:02,608 --> 00:24:04,110
This house gets ugly without you.

458
00:24:04,110 --> 00:24:06,070
I thought your vacation
would be longer.

459
00:24:06,070 --> 00:24:10,825
I miss our parties
and getting wasted together.

460
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:12,451
Embarrassing ourselves.

461
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,328
Jeez.

462
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:18,124
Do you think you can come?
For us to embarrass ourselves?

463
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:21,419
I'm going to try.
I'm going to check the airline tickets.

464
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:22,336
Okay.

465
00:24:22,336 --> 00:24:25,464
Pack your bags because I miss you.

466
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:29,135
Okay, I'm going to take a look.
I'm going to do my best.

467
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:30,636
Okay.

468
00:24:30,636 --> 00:24:32,722
Bye. God bless you. Bye.

469
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,028
This is our show, right.

470
00:24:47,028 --> 00:24:47,987
It's huge, huh.

471
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:52,033
The view isn't as pretty as the lake,

472
00:24:52,033 --> 00:24:53,868
but the color of the sails...

473
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:56,287
There's a lot of sails, right.

474
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:57,747
There's another board here.

475
00:24:57,747 --> 00:25:00,082
There's like 30 over here.
So many of them.

476
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:02,710
I got you this wider board.

477
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,962
- All right.
- It floats better.

478
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:07,256
It's better because not everybody
has experienced it.

479
00:25:07,256 --> 00:25:08,799
It's going to be easy.

480
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,134
This one over there is pretty easy.

481
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,011
Is it good?
I'm going to get it.

482
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,429
We'll come back soon.

483
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:14,597
If you need us, we're here.

484
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:16,807
No, we'll return them soon.

485
00:25:16,933 --> 00:25:19,018
- Let's go.
- You go first... This way.

486
00:25:21,354 --> 00:25:22,355
Let's go.

487
00:25:22,355 --> 00:25:23,314
Cool?

488
00:25:23,314 --> 00:25:25,233
All set, bro. Thanks for everything.

489
00:25:25,233 --> 00:25:26,859
- Have a nice paddle.
- Thanks.

490
00:25:47,004 --> 00:25:49,465
- We're here!
- Hey, kids!

491
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,092
We're here!

492
00:25:53,886 --> 00:25:56,430
We need help with the boards, man.

493
00:26:00,726 --> 00:26:02,019
What are you doing?

494
00:26:06,816 --> 00:26:07,900
Help me, bro. Fuck.

495
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,575
The phone wouldn't ring
if we weren't talking about it.

496
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,619
I wonder if we have to work...

497
00:26:20,496 --> 00:26:21,497
Hello?

498
00:26:21,497 --> 00:26:22,665
So... it's Ricardo.

499
00:26:22,665 --> 00:26:23,958
Hi, are you all right, boss?

500
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:28,004
All right, then.

501
00:26:29,964 --> 00:26:31,382
All right, then. Thanks.

502
00:26:33,009 --> 00:26:35,344
Guys, the four of us
are going to work today.

503
00:26:35,344 --> 00:26:36,512
- Damn...
- Everybody?

504
00:26:36,512 --> 00:26:38,014
The four girls.

505
00:26:38,014 --> 00:26:40,266
Let's go, guys!

506
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:41,350
Let's go!

507
00:27:22,183 --> 00:27:24,018
Ramon, we need to talk.

508
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:27,813
Yeah...

509
00:27:28,022 --> 00:27:29,565
We've talked a lot of times.

510
00:27:29,565 --> 00:27:33,861
But I think this situation
is not good for me.

511
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:38,741
It's not that I don't want it,
just to make things clear,

512
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:43,662
but... I need some distance right now.

513
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:47,041
I don't know if you noticed,
I was more distant today.

514
00:27:47,041 --> 00:27:48,376
Of course I noticed.

515
00:27:48,376 --> 00:27:51,087
But I need some time for me,

516
00:27:51,087 --> 00:27:53,881
because this situation
is making me feel bad.

517
00:27:53,881 --> 00:27:56,425
I don't want the house
to be affected like it was.

518
00:27:56,759 --> 00:28:00,930
I want you to have your space,
and that I have mine.

519
00:28:01,764 --> 00:28:03,933
You do whatever you want.

520
00:28:03,933 --> 00:28:06,560
I'll do whatever I want, what I feel.

521
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,188
- Live your life.
- Exactly.

522
00:28:09,188 --> 00:28:12,942
Be cool. I noticed
you were different and...

523
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:15,653
I gave you some space,
even if you didn't talk to me.

524
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,907
Be cool. I totally understand.

525
00:28:20,574 --> 00:28:22,368
I think, sometimes...

526
00:28:22,368 --> 00:28:25,329
Although we liked each other,
we need some space...

527
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:27,790
If it's meant to be, it'll be.

528
00:28:27,790 --> 00:28:29,583
That's it. Don't worry.

529
00:28:29,583 --> 00:28:30,876
If you need me...

530
00:28:48,978 --> 00:28:49,979
- Are you going upstairs?
- No.

531
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:50,896
Let's talk.

532
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:54,233
You're a pain in the ass...

533
00:28:54,233 --> 00:28:55,609
Will you go with him?

534
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:57,403
I'm going to talk to Ramon.

535
00:28:57,403 --> 00:29:01,574
When I talked to Nath
about touching her face,

536
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:06,078
I talked to her,
I apologized for what happened.

537
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:08,122
Then I heard things escalated,

538
00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:11,041
with one person telling the story
to the next.

539
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:15,880
I imagine you heard it like,
"Ramon slapped Nathália in the face."

540
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:16,881
I did.

541
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:22,720
So I put myself in your shoes
and wondered how I'd deal with that.

542
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,888
I'd probably get mad.

543
00:29:23,888 --> 00:29:26,265
Yes. Let me tell you some truths

544
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:30,519
you might enjoy or not.

545
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:31,562
Sure.

546
00:29:31,562 --> 00:29:34,273
I see her hurting.

547
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:37,735
Bro, me and Bia...
I'm going to tell you what we have.

548
00:29:37,735 --> 00:29:40,154
If she kisses somebody, I kiss, too.

549
00:29:40,154 --> 00:29:41,864
We've talked about it.

550
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:43,908
But you don't let her live her life.

551
00:29:44,033 --> 00:29:47,953
You have a... You shield her, you know?

552
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:51,373
But you're not protecting her as a friend.

553
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:53,459
- Nath is very defenseless.
- I believe that.

554
00:29:53,459 --> 00:29:55,044
Nath is very defenseless, bro.

555
00:29:55,044 --> 00:29:57,755
- Then there was that...
- That set it off.

556
00:29:57,755 --> 00:30:02,468
Yeah, and it was not only that.
I saw it every day, man...

557
00:30:02,468 --> 00:30:04,595
You know? I've already forgiven you.

558
00:30:04,595 --> 00:30:07,181
I think you're a good man,
but you made a mistake.

559
00:30:07,181 --> 00:30:09,433
- You didn't act like a man.
- I realize that.

560
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:11,435
That's important.
I also make mistakes.

561
00:30:11,435 --> 00:30:13,729
I'm not perfect.
I don't wanna be perfect.

562
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,773
- Nobody is perfect.
- We learn from mistakes.

563
00:30:15,773 --> 00:30:17,358
I think... Nobody is perfect.

564
00:30:17,358 --> 00:30:21,237
Man, we realized how many
good things happened

565
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:23,614
- because of this mess.
- Because of it...

566
00:30:23,614 --> 00:30:25,908
Got it? Wish you all the best, brother.

567
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:26,867
To us. Amen...

568
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:30,079
I hope the mood here
gets back to what it was.

569
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:31,247
It's going to...

570
00:30:31,247 --> 00:30:33,165
If that depends on me, you know...

571
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:35,167
We ended this, and in time... Thanks.

572
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,044
That, which booze separates,
food reunites.

573
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:37,962
Amen!

574
00:30:37,962 --> 00:30:39,380
We'll get back into the groove.

575
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,090
We're going to be in sync again.

576
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:42,716
- All right.
- We'll forget this.

577
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:44,093
Wish you all the best.

578
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:45,302
Amen. Let's go.

579
00:30:50,099 --> 00:30:52,017
Let's go. Let's make some money.

580
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:53,227
My brother. Good job.

581
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:54,395
- Let's go.
- Baby.

582
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:55,854
- Hi, honey.
- Give me a hug.

583
00:30:57,648 --> 00:30:59,233
Good job. Great.

584
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:03,362
I hope it's light. I hope it's wonderful.
Take care.

585
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:05,322
- God bless you.
- Bye, girls.

586
00:31:05,322 --> 00:31:06,490
Bye.

587
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:31,515
Good evening, welcome.

588
00:31:45,571 --> 00:31:49,658
Girl, there's a blond guy over there
who's just arrived.

589
00:31:49,658 --> 00:31:50,618
I can't see.

590
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:52,119
He's hot!

591
00:31:52,745 --> 00:31:54,413
Over there, black shirt.

592
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,707
Remember at Donna?
Murilo introduced me to a guy...

593
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:58,292
Let's see if he's the same.

594
00:31:58,292 --> 00:32:00,753
He's not, this one is hotter.
I would have noticed.

595
00:32:00,753 --> 00:32:01,795
I like blond guys.

596
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:28,530
What's up, baby?

597
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:29,823
What?

598
00:32:29,823 --> 00:32:32,326
Didn't you ask me to come?

599
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:34,703
You're kidding me?

600
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:37,998
- I'm working.
- You just needed to call me.

601
00:32:37,998 --> 00:32:39,249
I'm working right now.

602
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:40,292
I'll hug you soon.

603
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,002
This is Mauro, Blondie.

604
00:32:42,002 --> 00:32:43,671
- How are you?
- Nice to meet you.

605
00:32:43,671 --> 00:32:46,423
- Can I drink this?
- Are you going to mix us some cocktails?

606
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:48,342
Yes, coming right up.

607
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:50,678
I said the invitation... Were you nervous?

608
00:32:51,470 --> 00:32:53,180
You don't need to be.

609
00:32:54,431 --> 00:32:55,891
What would you like to drink?

610
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:57,059
Gin tonic.

611
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:59,186
Wait a minute, coming right up.

612
00:32:59,186 --> 00:33:00,646
One gin tonic, please.

613
00:33:00,646 --> 00:33:03,065
I'm kinda lost. Where is this place?

614
00:33:04,233 --> 00:33:06,735
How long are you going to stay?

615
00:33:06,735 --> 00:33:08,404
- I moved here.
- Wow!

616
00:33:08,404 --> 00:33:09,363
Do you need some help?

617
00:33:09,363 --> 00:33:11,281
- I missed you.
- Me, too.

618
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:14,743
- I was dying to see a familiar face.
- You needed a partner, right?

619
00:33:15,452 --> 00:33:17,496
I needed a partner.

620
00:33:18,831 --> 00:33:21,250
- It's very good to see you, man.
- Likewise.

621
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:22,710
- How are you?
- What's up?

622
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:24,420
- I'm Mauro.
- I'm Ricardo.

623
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:25,462
The bar's manager.

624
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:27,005
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

625
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:29,258
Nathália, you need to take five, right?

626
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:30,843
To rest a little bit, take a walk...

627
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:31,844
I think I need...

628
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:33,804
Yeah. Switch places with... Taynara.

629
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:35,180
- Okay.
- Is it okay?

630
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,015
No... It's me.

631
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,017
- Now it's her turn.
- One Aperol.

632
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,395
Can I order, girl? Two Sex on the Beach.

633
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:43,605
- Yes.
- I ordered Aperol.

634
00:33:43,605 --> 00:33:45,691
- Take care. Thanks.
- One Aperol.

635
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:53,866
- I missed you!
- I missed you.

636
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:58,287
It's good to see a familiar face.

637
00:33:58,287 --> 00:33:59,329
Oh, my God.

638
00:33:59,329 --> 00:34:00,831
I missed you.

639
00:34:00,831 --> 00:34:03,459
I wonder if somebody
will cry tonight. Absolutely.

640
00:34:03,459 --> 00:34:05,169
Yes... A lot. A lot.

641
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:06,795
Who? Ramon?

642
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,055
My baby!

643
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:19,892
We've come here for this.
Gaia left. Gaia left.

644
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:21,226
I like it this way.

645
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,520
That's a proper welcome,
with a kiss and all.

646
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:25,063
- How are you?
- Hi, what's up?

647
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,566
I noticed you're very happy.
You met your friend.

648
00:34:27,566 --> 00:34:29,318
- Sure...
- Yeah... Break is over.

649
00:34:29,985 --> 00:34:31,612
Let's get to work.

650
00:34:31,612 --> 00:34:32,780
I'll be a happy worker.

651
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:36,283
You can wait the tables. Then we'll see.

652
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:38,952
That table over there needs service.

653
00:34:40,120 --> 00:34:42,581
Can I get you anything?

654
00:34:52,758 --> 00:34:54,092
Hey, girls...

655
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:56,678
What's up, what's up, what's up?

656
00:34:58,514 --> 00:35:00,474
What's up, guys?

657
00:35:01,141 --> 00:35:02,893
Hey, get me a Sex on the Beach.

658
00:35:02,893 --> 00:35:04,478
They're here.

659
00:35:04,478 --> 00:35:05,562
- They are?
- Yes...

660
00:35:11,401 --> 00:35:13,153
This is my fellow citizen.

661
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:14,446
- Mauro.
- Really?

662
00:35:14,446 --> 00:35:16,031
- What's up?
- Luan, my brother.

663
00:35:16,031 --> 00:35:17,324
Have you already caught the flight?

664
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:19,284
- I have...
- Man, you're fast!

665
00:35:19,284 --> 00:35:20,702
What's up, Mauro!

666
00:35:20,702 --> 00:35:22,412
- What's up?
- Are you okay, kid?

667
00:35:22,412 --> 00:35:23,539
Hi, São Paulo!

668
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:25,457
- I'm Ramon.
- What's up? I'm Mauro...

669
00:35:26,250 --> 00:35:28,377
- Mauro...
- Let's do this!

670
00:35:28,377 --> 00:35:29,837
- What's up?
- What's up, bro?

671
00:35:29,837 --> 00:35:31,421
- How are you, bro?
- I'm great.

672
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:33,674
Treat him like a brother.

673
00:35:33,674 --> 00:35:34,758
Nice to meet you.

674
00:35:34,758 --> 00:35:36,468
- Welcome.
- Thanks, thanks.

675
00:35:42,599 --> 00:35:45,352
He's my friend for all moments.
He wakes up with me...

676
00:35:45,352 --> 00:35:46,895
Is he from Goiânia?

677
00:35:48,897 --> 00:35:51,733
I think he is...
She spoke very highly of you.

678
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:52,860
Did she?

679
00:36:03,620 --> 00:36:05,581
Remember that guy
Ramon said he didn't like?

680
00:36:05,581 --> 00:36:10,460
The hot blond guy... He's here, right?

681
00:36:10,460 --> 00:36:12,629
The one you were flirting with?

682
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:13,630
I want his number.

683
00:36:13,630 --> 00:36:16,216
I'll go, I was already talking to him.

684
00:36:16,216 --> 00:36:18,176
I'm going to get his phone number.

685
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:21,013
Maybe some other day. Okay?

686
00:36:30,731 --> 00:36:32,858
Excuse me. Aren't you from Nonna?

687
00:36:32,858 --> 00:36:34,651
- We've met at Donna.
- At Donna.

688
00:36:34,651 --> 00:36:35,903
Don't you remember me?

689
00:36:35,903 --> 00:36:37,863
- We talked for three minutes.
- Us?

690
00:36:37,863 --> 00:36:38,947
Yes, you and I...

691
00:36:38,947 --> 00:36:42,576
That blondie friend of yours
and one friend of mine.

692
00:36:42,576 --> 00:36:43,994
I don't remember.

693
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:45,454
Do you work there?

694
00:36:45,454 --> 00:36:46,872
I play there, I work there.

695
00:36:46,872 --> 00:36:48,457
Now, I remember.

696
00:36:48,457 --> 00:36:49,875
Exactly.

697
00:36:49,875 --> 00:36:52,836
Somebody wanted to kiss you,
but you were working.

698
00:36:52,836 --> 00:36:54,504
Now I remember.

699
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:56,298
Exactly.

700
00:36:56,298 --> 00:36:57,382
I got it.

701
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:01,762
There's going to be
a great party the day after tomorrow.

702
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:03,805
Not like Art's,
but it's a party with style.

703
00:37:03,931 --> 00:37:05,891
At Jurerê. I'm going to play.

704
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:07,976
It'd be awesome if you come.

705
00:37:07,976 --> 00:37:09,061
It's gonna be awesome later.

706
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:11,063
The whole gang is
going to be there.

707
00:37:11,063 --> 00:37:12,481
Sure, bring everybody.

708
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:13,941
This party will be amazing.

709
00:37:13,941 --> 00:37:16,652
I'm gonna get your number
for this party later.

710
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:17,653
It'll be on Thursday.

711
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:19,947
Let's go, go with me.
It's gonna be amazing.

712
00:37:19,947 --> 00:37:21,323
What music do you play?

713
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:23,116
I play electronic.

714
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:25,118
I'll get your beers
and I'll be right back.

715
00:37:25,118 --> 00:37:26,453
It's a deal. Tell them.

716
00:37:28,538 --> 00:37:31,708
Girls, wrap up what you're doing here...

717
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:33,794
In two minutes,
you are free to enjoy the party.

718
00:37:33,794 --> 00:37:34,878
I'll handle this.

719
00:38:07,077 --> 00:38:07,953
You're really something...

720
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:10,580
Everybody is drunk.

721
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:14,459
Everybody is drunk.

722
00:38:17,045 --> 00:38:18,296
Really?

723
00:38:28,598 --> 00:38:32,060
Baby, you deserve no harm at all.

724
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:33,770
No...

725
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:37,024
I won't harm you at all.

726
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:38,316
I hope so.

727
00:38:49,202 --> 00:38:50,829
I'll wait for my guest.

728
00:38:51,413 --> 00:38:53,582
I hope he stays forever.

729
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:56,960
I'm going to show you the bed.

730
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,463
I approve this. It's approved.

731
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:02,591
- Upstairs?
- Yes.

732
00:39:17,314 --> 00:39:19,983
There's a double bed
and bunks for singles,

733
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:21,526
which isn't the case for us.

734
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,320
- Where are we going to sleep?
- Here.

735
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,529
I just want to know.

736
00:39:48,804 --> 00:39:50,555
I don't believe this.

737
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:54,142
Are you sure?

738
00:40:10,283 --> 00:40:11,284
Hi.

739
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:12,661
Is anybody here?

740
00:40:13,453 --> 00:40:14,871
Nobody is in here.

741
00:40:14,871 --> 00:40:16,832
This must be the friend...

742
00:40:17,332 --> 00:40:18,917
Yes...

743
00:40:18,917 --> 00:40:21,294
The couple from Goiás slept here.
Leave them alone.

744
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:27,801
Our bedroom is huge, bro.

745
00:40:33,181 --> 00:40:35,058
This is my bed.

746
00:40:35,058 --> 00:40:36,393
- Is this your bed?
- Yeah.

747
00:41:11,887 --> 00:41:12,929
Go, Ju!

748
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:14,806
- Go, João!
- Go, João!

749
00:41:30,739 --> 00:41:32,407
- Come on, clean it.
- That's my bed.

750
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:33,742
- Luan saw...
- Yeah, right.

751
00:41:33,742 --> 00:41:35,285
You're fucked up.

752
00:41:35,285 --> 00:41:37,245
You're going to sleep
in the Tiger Room.

753
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:38,580
I've already slept there.

754
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,040
- Okay. Hey.
- Come on. It's okay.

755
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,541
...get Murilo out of there.

756
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:42,667
This bed is mine.

757
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,586
You're annoying.

758
00:41:44,878 --> 00:41:46,129
Fuck off, Nath.

759
00:41:46,129 --> 00:41:49,341
Go away, go away, go away,
go away, go away.

760
00:41:50,759 --> 00:41:53,011
You're going to sleep on the Tiger's bed.

761
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:54,512
You're sleeping on the Tiger Room.

762
00:41:54,512 --> 00:41:57,057
- Murilo and Tay are going to sleep here.
- Go away.

763
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:00,852
You're fucking with me.

764
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:02,896
Fuck you, Murilo.

765
00:42:02,896 --> 00:42:06,858
- No. Fuck you.
- Go fuck yourself.

766
00:42:06,858 --> 00:42:09,736
This whole drama is your fault.

767
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:15,992
She wants to have a boyfriend

768
00:42:19,329 --> 00:42:22,958
And I know pretty well how all this ends

769
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:33,134
Now this is the life

770
00:42:33,134 --> 00:42:35,971
Fucking every day

771
00:42:37,764 --> 00:42:42,102
Waking up naked with Nath by your side

772
00:42:42,102 --> 00:42:43,520
Dear Lord.

773
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:28,356
Oh, my God. I loved this episode!

774
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:33,111
Nathália brought her dream boy.
I don't know, dude came in.

775
00:43:33,111 --> 00:43:35,155
Everything happened,
but she didn't like it...

776
00:43:35,155 --> 00:43:37,032
She likes Ramon. She's in love.

777
00:43:37,032 --> 00:43:40,577
I think she is...
She doesn't have a good strategy.

778
00:43:40,577 --> 00:43:42,245
What is a good strategy?

779
00:43:42,245 --> 00:43:47,792
To kiss in front of a friend
of the person you're targeting.

780
00:43:47,792 --> 00:43:49,002
She wanted to rub it in his face.

781
00:43:49,002 --> 00:43:52,380
She invited that guy to have sex with her.

782
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:54,174
And she kissed the guy in front of him.

783
00:43:54,174 --> 00:43:56,760
She invited an old lover,
a boy she was already intimate with.

784
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:58,386
She kissed a lot in front of him.

785
00:43:58,386 --> 00:44:00,597
It was clear she'd fuck the dude...

786
00:44:00,597 --> 00:44:02,640
Then he looked and said,
"I'm not doing anything either."

787
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,641
He wasn't going to show...

788
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:05,185
But it did more damage to her than to him.

789
00:44:05,185 --> 00:44:08,188
He wasn't going to show he was pissed.

790
00:44:08,188 --> 00:44:09,606
But he wasn't even pissed.

791
00:44:09,606 --> 00:44:11,441
Looks like he understood
she didn't want him anymore.

792
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:12,692
No, he was. He didn't show it.

793
00:44:12,692 --> 00:44:13,985
He was pissed 'cause he was ditched.

794
00:44:13,985 --> 00:44:16,404
He wasn't pissed. He got mad
because she called him a boy,

795
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:19,032
that she wished had never met him.
It was over for him that moment.

796
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:21,743
He said, "I'm over this girl.
I'm over her.

797
00:44:21,743 --> 00:44:23,912
That shows Luan... Luan's done so much.

798
00:44:23,912 --> 00:44:27,040
She said she was mad
and was going to his bed.

799
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,334
She went to his bed,
she was sleeping with him.

800
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:33,463
Who was the fuckup now?
Was it Luan who defended her?

801
00:44:33,463 --> 00:44:35,382
Or was it her,
who made up that fanfic...

802
00:44:35,382 --> 00:44:37,634
I think it's exactly that.

803
00:44:37,634 --> 00:44:39,219
- It's gone bad, John.
- Bro, that's it.

804
00:44:39,219 --> 00:44:42,639
Then they are not going to look
like Murilo and the other girl.

805
00:44:42,639 --> 00:44:44,182
Nathália is not...

806
00:44:44,182 --> 00:44:47,894
Man, she wanted to hurt him
and it backfired.

807
00:44:47,894 --> 00:44:49,813
She invited him and now
she'll have to put up with him

808
00:44:49,813 --> 00:44:50,772
while she wants other...

809
00:44:50,772 --> 00:44:52,732
- She's fucked up.
- She went overboard.

810
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:53,733
Everything was wrong.

811
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:55,819
Nathália screwed up. And so did Luan.

812
00:44:55,819 --> 00:44:56,986
Now he's like, "I defend her."

813
00:44:56,986 --> 00:44:59,406
- Taking meat to the barbecue is wrong.
- She screwed up.

814
00:44:59,406 --> 00:45:02,992
I think that, in the end,
Nathália's strategy didn't work. Right?

815
00:45:02,992 --> 00:45:05,578
Because she was mad in the end...

816
00:45:05,578 --> 00:45:06,996
I thought Ramon was great.

817
00:45:07,747 --> 00:45:08,623
Yeah...

818
00:45:08,623 --> 00:45:11,292
He didn't insult her.
He didn't want to tease her.

819
00:45:11,292 --> 00:45:12,585
He was amazing.

820
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:15,213
- He apologized to Luan...
- He didn't play...

821
00:45:15,213 --> 00:45:17,215
- He apologized to Luan...
- And to her.

822
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:20,885
- I'd be Ramon's friend. Absolutely.
- Let's watch the rest of it.

823
00:45:24,347 --> 00:45:25,473
Girl...

824
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:28,268
Ramon is with somebody, easy.

825
00:45:28,268 --> 00:45:30,895
Let's go out to funk dance?

826
00:45:31,521 --> 00:45:33,064
MOMMIES
ARE HERE

827
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:39,279
- Friday night at home, bro?
- Fuck you!

828
00:45:40,071 --> 00:45:42,031
The girls left the guys at home
and went funk dancing...

829
00:45:42,031 --> 00:45:45,577
- And Nathália was crying because of Ramon?
- She wasn't crying.

830
00:45:45,577 --> 00:45:47,829
She came in, the girls said,
"Stay there."

831
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:50,832
I think she was
trying to tell something...

832
00:45:50,832 --> 00:45:52,792
Let's watch to find out, guys.

833
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:54,377
- But it's next week.
- Come on.

834
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:55,336
Come on, guys.

835
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:57,922
Hey, Amazon, I know
I have the premium package.

836
00:45:57,922 --> 00:45:59,048
Send it home.

837
00:45:59,048 --> 00:46:00,592
I can't wait to see it.

838
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:02,635
Oh, no, I can't wait until then.

839
00:46:02,635 --> 00:46:04,929
I'm going to check some threads...

840
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:07,307
I just wanted to know
if João is going to fuck...

841
00:46:07,307 --> 00:46:09,100
If he'll keep banging next week.

842
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:11,603
No, I'm sure, you got it right...

843
00:46:11,603 --> 00:46:13,313
I'm going to the bathroom.

844
00:46:13,313 --> 00:46:14,856
Can we go? For Christ's sake.
