1
00:00:15,141 --> 00:00:17,768
Good morning, friends.

2
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:20,354
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

3
00:00:20,354 --> 00:00:22,022
Today is the day.

4
00:00:26,777 --> 00:00:27,778
Son of a bitch.

5
00:00:27,778 --> 00:00:29,572
Look how close they are now, guys.

6
00:00:29,572 --> 00:00:31,532
Consider the first day and today.

7
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:34,577
Hello, people. How are you? Look...

8
00:00:34,744 --> 00:00:39,623
We're here together to watch Episode 6
of Floripa Beach House.

9
00:00:39,623 --> 00:00:41,876
I want to remind you
that the previous episode

10
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:47,673
ended with Nathalia
catching Ramon red-handed.

11
00:00:47,798 --> 00:00:52,428
"Catching him red-handed?"
That was a good one. Great.

12
00:00:52,428 --> 00:00:54,597
What? Did you know about this?

13
00:00:54,597 --> 00:01:00,227
To catch red-handed is a soap opera
back in Cuiabá, got it? That's it.

14
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:04,315
Remember, Floripa Beach House
has no rules, no limits, okay?

15
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:07,693
No script, it's real life. Absolutely.

16
00:01:10,863 --> 00:01:12,156
Do you remember that...

17
00:01:12,156 --> 00:01:13,324
That's nice...

18
00:01:13,449 --> 00:01:16,243
On the teaser, Luan was fighting again?

19
00:01:16,243 --> 00:01:17,328
What?

20
00:01:17,328 --> 00:01:18,788
On last week's teaser.

21
00:01:19,371 --> 00:01:21,582
- So, let's watch it?
- Let's do it.

22
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:22,666
Press play. Bye, thanks.

23
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:23,751
Yeah, that's true.

24
00:01:23,751 --> 00:01:25,461
That's real.

25
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:27,129
Get out.

26
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:28,214
You're sassy...

27
00:01:57,493 --> 00:02:00,412
WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS

28
00:02:53,007 --> 00:02:54,508
No, it's not.

29
00:02:54,884 --> 00:02:56,969
Bro, I don't remember this.

30
00:02:56,969 --> 00:02:58,304
Ever.

31
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:00,556
Taking pictures at parties...

32
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:01,557
Good morning.

33
00:03:01,557 --> 00:03:03,726
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

34
00:03:08,898 --> 00:03:09,899
You're so...

35
00:03:09,899 --> 00:03:11,692
What is it?

36
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:12,776
I'm embarrassed.

37
00:03:12,776 --> 00:03:15,446
I'm the one who gets to be embarrassed.

38
00:03:23,913 --> 00:03:26,790
Give me a kiss. Take care, all right?

39
00:03:26,790 --> 00:03:29,376
You got it, I will.
Thanks, I loved meeting you.

40
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:30,461
Me, too.

41
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:36,300
Bye. Be careful, don't fall over there.
You're going to fall.

42
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,745
- Let's see what's inside this box.
- Open it.

43
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:08,332
CRUSH'S PARTY

44
00:04:08,457 --> 00:04:10,167
- It's the party thing.
- That's rad.

45
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,627
Look at this flyer.

46
00:04:11,627 --> 00:04:13,212
The party flyers.

47
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:14,380
- Here.
- Look.

48
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,422
Whose party?

49
00:04:15,422 --> 00:04:17,091
The party Ricardo told me about.

50
00:04:17,091 --> 00:04:18,759
We're the promoters.

51
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,843
That's awesome.

52
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:21,387
Crush's party.

53
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:24,974
Conceição Lagoon. Choose your look
in the right color and meet your match.

54
00:04:24,974 --> 00:04:26,058
Wait. Let's see.

55
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:27,142
Did you hear it?

56
00:04:27,142 --> 00:04:29,395
- Is it a message?
- Ricardo, João. Hey, João.

57
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:31,689
- Damn, that's cool.
- Come here, João.

58
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:34,984
What's up, guys? How are you?

59
00:04:34,984 --> 00:04:37,194
You got the party flyer.

60
00:04:37,194 --> 00:04:41,490
I want all of you to focus on this, right?
You have to promote this party.

61
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,368
We need to crowd that bar.

62
00:04:44,368 --> 00:04:49,039
We have to bring a lot of
beautiful people, rock that party.

63
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:53,711
I wonder if I could ask my brother
to show up at this party.

64
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:55,838
I don't know. What do you think...

65
00:04:55,838 --> 00:04:56,880
When is it?

66
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,049
But, João, we could take the car...

67
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:01,176
- It's complicated.
- Be my guest...

68
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:05,014
...me, you, Murilo and Luan. We promote it
today, take the car, four of us,

69
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:06,598
then, tomorrow, the girls promote it.

70
00:05:06,598 --> 00:05:08,183
- We could do it...
- I'm in.

71
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:12,146
Bye, guys. Bye.

72
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,107
Bye, bye.

73
00:05:15,107 --> 00:05:16,233
Let's rock this party.

74
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,568
Let's take the back seat.

75
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:18,694
Stay together.

76
00:05:40,674 --> 00:05:43,343
Man, in my opinion,
we should go to the beaches...

77
00:05:43,343 --> 00:05:44,720
Fuck your opinion.

78
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:47,931
No, but I'm giving my opinion
so that you consider it.

79
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,017
I agree with the beaches.

80
00:05:50,476 --> 00:05:53,145
- See? You talk too much...
- There's no big deal here.

81
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,108
The car is too high.

82
00:05:58,108 --> 00:05:59,777
Bro... You got big, kid.

83
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,659
A party, at Kai...

84
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:09,495
It's going to have lots of colors...

85
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:10,579
I'm inviting you guys...

86
00:06:10,579 --> 00:06:12,915
The sponsorship is...

87
00:06:12,915 --> 00:06:15,584
I want to invite you to a party
we're having tomorrow.

88
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:17,795
We're promoting here. It's right there,

89
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:19,838
at Kai's bar.
Have you been there?

90
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:20,964
Not yet.

91
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,842
If you want to invite your friends...
What beautiful eyes!

92
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:24,843
Thanks.

93
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,303
I hope to see them tomorrow.

94
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:27,679
João, let's go.

95
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:29,932
Let's go, I still have to work.

96
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:37,272
It's at 7:00 p.m.,
you pay for what you order.

97
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:40,984
It's gonna be crazy. Let's do it,
couples welcome, invite the gang. Okay?

98
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:43,695
If you want to invite
anybody to the party,

99
00:06:43,695 --> 00:06:46,365
you're welcome. Admission is free.

100
00:06:46,365 --> 00:06:47,783
Okay... Cool. Where is it?

101
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:50,285
If you need it,
there's a phone number here.

102
00:06:51,286 --> 00:06:52,329
Okay?

103
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:54,498
Admission is free.

104
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:57,292
Hey, girl, we're having
a party here tomorrow night.

105
00:06:57,292 --> 00:07:01,255
If you're interested,
it starts at 7:00, okay?

106
00:07:01,255 --> 00:07:04,466
I found the perfect chick, man.

107
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:08,762
Do you want to come to the party tomorrow?
I'm organizing it with the boys.

108
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:12,015
Look over here, the first kiss.

109
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:17,104
This is really you.

110
00:07:17,104 --> 00:07:18,355
Let me see it.

111
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:22,526
I'm going to take her...
First Joyce, now her. What's her name?

112
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,572
Go, go.

113
00:07:26,572 --> 00:07:28,740
- Go.
- Go.

114
00:07:40,836 --> 00:07:43,172
Why don't you invite somebody,

115
00:07:43,172 --> 00:07:47,050
a friend or your boy, to tomorrow's party?

116
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:48,594
I wanted to invite my friend.

117
00:07:48,594 --> 00:07:53,140
Call her, then call me.
To have some fun...

118
00:07:54,183 --> 00:07:56,602
I don't know...
We're going to mess with...

119
00:08:09,114 --> 00:08:10,282
Girls...

120
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:16,205
Fuck... We're starving, man.

121
00:08:16,205 --> 00:08:17,915
- Didn't you eat?
- No.

122
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,292
We thought you'd eaten.

123
00:08:20,292 --> 00:08:21,627
Jeez, we were sure...

124
00:08:21,627 --> 00:08:22,794
No, we worked a lot.

125
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,714
Fuck... We invited everybody.

126
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:44,483
Hello?

127
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:45,901
What's up, Tô?

128
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:51,240
What's up, man? It's crazy, right, bro?

129
00:08:52,324 --> 00:08:56,078
- That's weird.
- Holy shit, man.

130
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,334
Bro... I miss you, man.

131
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:04,086
Fuck, man. How are you, man?

132
00:09:04,086 --> 00:09:06,296
- Bro...
- Is it cool? Really?

133
00:09:06,296 --> 00:09:09,675
It's hard to explain.
It's crazy here, man...

134
00:09:09,675 --> 00:09:14,429
I'm shaking, talking to you, man.
I even farted.

135
00:09:14,429 --> 00:09:16,473
- Really?
- Yeah. It's crazy, man. Look...

136
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:18,725
That's crazy...

137
00:09:18,725 --> 00:09:21,770
There's a room here called Tiger Room.

138
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,190
My brother, I'm staying in this room.

139
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:28,986
I had an idea...

140
00:09:28,986 --> 00:09:31,947
What are you doing tomorrow, man?

141
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:34,741
I'm going to work, right?

142
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:38,620
Kid, come here tomorrow. Come have fun...

143
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,415
- Tomorrow?
- Come party with me tomorrow.

144
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:45,335
Come tomorrow, kid...
Tomorrow's the day. All I'm saying.

145
00:09:45,335 --> 00:09:47,337
Easy, kid... Easy, man.

146
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,632
I have to organize things, right, man?
It's not like, "I'm going."

147
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:54,845
Brother, that's the only chance you'll
have to party with me. It's tomorrow.

148
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:57,472
I have to see this. I'm going to decide.

149
00:09:57,472 --> 00:09:59,683
Tomorrow? Do I have to go tomorrow?

150
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:04,938
The party is tomorrow. Tomorrow night.
Come, spend the day tomorrow.

151
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:10,902
You can stay here.
Take two, three days off, find a way.

152
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:15,198
Fuck, man. I'll decide on this.
See if I can make it, okay?

153
00:10:15,198 --> 00:10:17,701
Okay, brother. God bless you.
You have to come.

154
00:10:20,078 --> 00:10:22,873
Awesome.

155
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:39,890
What are you doing tonight?

156
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:42,684
Bro, there's a place called Lontra...

157
00:10:42,684 --> 00:10:44,353
The bus is here.

158
00:10:44,353 --> 00:10:46,396
Let's go.

159
00:11:23,058 --> 00:11:24,976
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

160
00:12:31,543 --> 00:12:33,587
What do you think I am?

161
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:39,259
I don't give a fuck about those guys.
What did you want me to do? Look.

162
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:56,943
No, kid. Look... Luan,

163
00:12:56,943 --> 00:13:00,197
I don't want to argue with you, okay?

164
00:13:00,197 --> 00:13:03,617
I respect you, you respect me.

165
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:07,204
I respect you... Go fuck him if you want.
Kiss him if you want. Fuck.

166
00:13:07,204 --> 00:13:09,956
If you think like that,
that's your problem.

167
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:39,194
Bê is dancing on the counter,
and he's after Bê.

168
00:13:39,194 --> 00:13:41,196
What's the deal with Murilo?

169
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:43,573
I think Murilo has no ulterior motives.

170
00:13:43,573 --> 00:13:47,786
No, of course... It's not that vibe.
I don't know, it's not that vibe.

171
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:50,664
No, I think you can trust
Murilo blindly, man.

172
00:13:50,664 --> 00:13:52,290
He made a mistake.

173
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,375
I didn't see it.

174
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:55,335
Imagine him breaking up with Tay,

175
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:59,548
and I lean Tay against the wall and twerk
on her ass. Yeah, right, totally fine.

176
00:13:59,548 --> 00:14:02,133
- I didn't see it.
- No, then it's okay, right?

177
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:04,469
I didn't see it, bro.

178
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:06,096
That's it.

179
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:12,852
Sort things out with him.

180
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:16,273
I wasn't nervous for nothing.
I won't sort things out with him.

181
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:21,194
I won't sort things out with him, man.
For me, it's bullshit. Fuck it.

182
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:29,244
It's over... Let's go.

183
00:14:44,634 --> 00:14:46,136
The car is here, look.

184
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,929
Get in, get in.

185
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:49,681
I'm cool.

186
00:14:49,681 --> 00:14:51,391
You're a screw-up.

187
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:09,284
We ruled. We ruled, baby.

188
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:12,329
This one wanted things to get ugly...

189
00:15:13,288 --> 00:15:15,040
Fuck him. Fuck him, idiot.

190
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:22,547
I'm going to pretend
I'm not listening to you, Luan.

191
00:15:22,547 --> 00:15:24,841
- Be quiet.
- No, you be quiet.

192
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:28,345
- Be quiet. You mess things up.
- You be quiet.

193
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:32,641
That's who you are, Beatriz.
What did I say to you? Be free.

194
00:15:32,641 --> 00:15:36,561
Baby, shut up, you know shit about me.

195
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:38,229
This is you. This is you...

196
00:15:38,229 --> 00:15:41,149
- That's right.
- Don't pretend to be a good person.

197
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:43,443
- This is me.
- Twerking on people's faces.

198
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:46,279
- You, go fuck yourself.
- Fuck you!

199
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:48,448
Man...

200
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:53,787
- we danced a lot.
- Man, what?

201
00:15:55,789 --> 00:15:57,499
I danced with Bia a lot. Fuck it.

202
00:15:57,624 --> 00:16:02,212
I saw it. What if it was me and Tay?
Now you're upset, right?

203
00:16:02,212 --> 00:16:06,216
You do whatever you want, Luan.
You do whatever you want, you know?

204
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:08,635
Respect me, boy. Respect me, boy.

205
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,387
Know your place, boy.

206
00:16:10,387 --> 00:16:14,099
Get your hands off me.

207
00:16:14,099 --> 00:16:15,809
No, she likes it, she means it.

208
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:18,978
I danced with Bia. Like I danced with Tay,

209
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,565
like I danced with Blondie.
Do you wanna fight? Let's fight.

210
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:23,858
What do you want?

211
00:16:23,858 --> 00:16:26,528
You know, I'm not going to ignore this!

212
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,530
I want to fight you!

213
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:29,656
I'm not going to ignore this.

214
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:30,824
Stop it!

215
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,118
I know how to kick ass...

216
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:34,577
Are you fucking with me?

217
00:16:34,577 --> 00:16:36,121
Murilo...

218
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,623
Are you making fun of me?

219
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,208
Murilo! Murilo!

220
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:43,545
I've always respected you. Always.

221
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:44,629
Me, too. So what?

222
00:16:44,629 --> 00:16:48,466
I'm going to tell you something.
I never treated you like this, you know?

223
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:49,801
Easy...

224
00:16:49,801 --> 00:16:52,971
You're imagining things, buddy.
Who do you think you are?

225
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,598
Stop it, guys. Please, stop it, man.

226
00:16:55,598 --> 00:16:58,935
Do you think you have five balls?
I have six, buddy.

227
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,187
- Do you have six? Come here, then.
- Stop it!

228
00:17:01,187 --> 00:17:05,483
I'm not going to ignore you, you know?
I've always respected you.

229
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:09,738
No, brothers, brothers...
For Christ's sake...

230
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:12,657
- Stop it!
- You fucking piece of shit.

231
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:17,620
You piece of shit?
Come here, then, you piece of shit!

232
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:20,832
He's a dick! Hey!

233
00:17:22,667 --> 00:17:23,668
You think you're a man?

234
00:17:23,668 --> 00:17:25,503
Easy. No... Stop this.

235
00:17:25,503 --> 00:17:26,588
What do you think you are?

236
00:17:26,588 --> 00:17:29,257
- They're going to kill him.
- Easy, Murilo.

237
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,800
I respected your girl a lot.

238
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,011
- Easy, Murilo.
- No, I saw it.

239
00:17:33,011 --> 00:17:36,890
Because yesterday when you were wasted,
I took care of her, you fucker.

240
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:39,851
That's because I care about you, buddy.

241
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:41,644
Easy, Murilo. Don't do this.

242
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:43,229
I don't give a fuck, you know?

243
00:17:43,229 --> 00:17:45,899
You're better than this, Murilo.

244
00:17:45,899 --> 00:17:48,568
Come and get some.
See this, bro? I did nothing.

245
00:17:48,568 --> 00:17:53,823
Do you know where I come from?
You come here, bro. Let me pass!

246
00:17:53,823 --> 00:17:56,451
- I did nothing.
- No, you don't need it.

247
00:17:56,451 --> 00:18:00,371
- He attacked me, you know?
- We know it. We saw it. Everybody did.

248
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,915
Let's take care of her.

249
00:18:01,915 --> 00:18:03,833
You can't face me. Look...

250
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:05,460
Stop it, Murilo.

251
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,337
Don't you want to talk?

252
00:18:07,337 --> 00:18:09,672
Come here, then.
Come on. Fuck you!

253
00:18:11,216 --> 00:18:12,175
Murilo...

254
00:18:12,175 --> 00:18:15,220
You wanna talk to everybody.
You're a showoff.

255
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,306
Put yourself in your place.

256
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:19,891
I have to make you pass out.

257
00:19:43,474 --> 00:19:46,519
Fuck, what a mess. My God.

258
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:58,406
- Good morning, my brother.
- Good morning, brother.

259
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:01,075
Did you sleep well? Good?

260
00:20:01,075 --> 00:20:02,827
No, bro. No.

261
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,622
I'm going to throw this out.

262
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:21,179
Fuck, Luan, bro...
What are you doing to yourself, man?

263
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:23,556
How cute are they...

264
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:25,058
What?

265
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:29,562
How cute are they... Bro, what a day!

266
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:32,273
- Did you get to sleep?
- Just a little. I took a nap.

267
00:20:32,273 --> 00:20:33,483
Good...

268
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,444
Has Luan come out of his room?

269
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:37,987
What?

270
00:20:38,613 --> 00:20:40,239
- No...
- No sign of him.

271
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:58,424
Do you remember everything?

272
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:01,719
Yes. Nath, I got really jealous.

273
00:21:03,054 --> 00:21:06,641
I pictured Beatriz dancing,
leaning against the wall, twerking...

274
00:21:06,641 --> 00:21:09,560
And Murilão behind her,
thinking he was the man.

275
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,145
It's not like that.

276
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:13,940
I think that wasn't necessary,
not all over again.

277
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,233
I know...

278
00:21:15,233 --> 00:21:18,569
Do you understand? Is this going to happen
whenever you get jealous?

279
00:21:19,487 --> 00:21:21,864
That was the first time
because of jealousy.

280
00:21:21,864 --> 00:21:23,616
But I'm talking about the future...

281
00:21:23,616 --> 00:21:25,785
No, I'm wrong, Nath. I'm wrong, Nath.

282
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:29,872
But Beatriz did it... She did it...

283
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:33,418
But I don't think like that.
In my opinion...

284
00:21:33,418 --> 00:21:36,629
Murilo wanted to talk to you respectfully.

285
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:41,009
Even I danced with Murilo, I hug Murilo,

286
00:21:41,009 --> 00:21:42,719
and there's nothing going on.

287
00:21:42,719 --> 00:21:47,598
I'm not defending you. You were wrong.
I won't leave you alone.

288
00:21:47,598 --> 00:21:49,350
- It's cool.
- That's it.

289
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,476
Thanks.

290
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:54,022
Weren't you the one who said,
"Are you going to support me? I am."

291
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:55,481
That's it. I'm all right.

292
00:21:55,481 --> 00:21:57,817
- Have you already eaten?
- No...

293
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:58,901
Do you want something?

294
00:21:58,901 --> 00:22:00,403
No, I'm going downstairs.

295
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,376
Can I sit here?

296
00:22:15,376 --> 00:22:20,089
Yeah, bro. Go ahead.
Just let me smoke this cigarette.

297
00:22:20,089 --> 00:22:21,716
No problem.

298
00:22:57,085 --> 00:23:01,380
Tobacco is there. I left half of it there.
You're going to smoke. Yeah.

299
00:23:08,179 --> 00:23:10,723
I wanted to explain what I thought, okay?

300
00:23:10,723 --> 00:23:12,600
I know I'm wrong, okay?

301
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,644
I apologize before starting
this conversation.

302
00:23:14,644 --> 00:23:15,728
No problem...

303
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:19,732
I'm a little aggressive. People know me.
I got really jealous of Bia.

304
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,401
When I came back from the smoking lounge,

305
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,987
Bia and Nath were dancing
with you behind them.

306
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:28,407
Man, that could be anybody.
Unfortunately, it was you.

307
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:32,787
And the way she was dancing, man...
It was fucked up, you know?

308
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:37,041
Leaning against the wall, twerking
her ass, and it was you, bro, sadly.

309
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,502
For me that's very serious, you know?

310
00:23:39,502 --> 00:23:42,630
But I'm truly sorry, bro.
I didn't even sleep, you know?

311
00:23:42,630 --> 00:23:43,714
Relax...

312
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:45,174
By the look on my face...

313
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:47,885
When I took some medicine,
I fell asleep, but I said,

314
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:50,763
"Man, I have to talk to Murilo first."
First of all...

315
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:54,725
I know I can trust few people here,
and you're one of them.

316
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:57,228
I should've never suspected you

317
00:23:57,228 --> 00:23:59,981
and involved you in that situation,
you know? Really.

318
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:01,399
Relax. We're good.

319
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:03,442
I apologize from the bottom of my heart.

320
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:06,737
From the bottom of my heart, bro.
That's I why called you, bro.

321
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:09,240
Relax... We're here to grow, man.

322
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:14,203
You know? We're good. Relax...

323
00:24:25,298 --> 00:24:29,594
Bê... Can you go to the Tiger Room
so that we can talk? Five minutes.

324
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:34,056
Okay, it's quick. I'm just going
to shower. Okay? Just a second.

325
00:24:55,870 --> 00:24:57,121
Damn, it's cold in here.

326
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:58,789
The way I like it, right.

327
00:25:00,166 --> 00:25:01,542
Can I give you a hug first?

328
00:25:01,542 --> 00:25:03,294
I was going to ask you.

329
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:09,091
Man, I'm sorry, you know?

330
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,595
I talked to Murilo...

331
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:16,766
I'm here to apologize to you
for the things I said.

332
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:20,019
You're a very important woman to me.

333
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,563
You became very important
in a very short time.

334
00:25:22,563 --> 00:25:26,651
I know I want you in my life forever,
no matter what.

335
00:25:26,651 --> 00:25:29,237
I understand your motives. I don't know...

336
00:25:29,237 --> 00:25:31,405
Do you want to know the truth?

337
00:25:31,405 --> 00:25:32,490
What?

338
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:36,953
The truth is that I love you. Truly.

339
00:25:36,953 --> 00:25:39,413
It's a very pure and real feeling.

340
00:25:39,413 --> 00:25:41,707
Forgive me, my love.

341
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:45,419
That's all I need.

342
00:25:47,046 --> 00:25:48,339
Yes, sure.

343
00:25:55,471 --> 00:25:58,307
The most important is that
you realized what you had to

344
00:25:58,307 --> 00:26:00,351
and apologized, you know?

345
00:26:00,351 --> 00:26:05,898
You were humble enough to see
that nobody's perfect...

346
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,609
- Can you hug me again?
- Yes.

347
00:26:15,032 --> 00:26:16,450
I miss you.

348
00:26:26,127 --> 00:26:28,212
- Where's Bia?
- Me?

349
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:30,631
- We have to leave in 15 minutes, okay?
- Oh, my.

350
00:26:33,801 --> 00:26:35,469
- Bye.
- Take care.

351
00:26:42,268 --> 00:26:44,145
Man, the guy is exaggerating, dude.

352
00:26:44,145 --> 00:26:45,271
I believe him...

353
00:26:45,396 --> 00:26:46,480
Bia, what would you do?

354
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,565
I already...

355
00:26:47,565 --> 00:26:51,527
I would listen to him.
I've already been in love at first sight.

356
00:26:51,527 --> 00:26:53,321
Have you been in love at first sight?

357
00:26:53,321 --> 00:26:55,906
- That's called passion.
- It's passion, exactly.

358
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:57,074
But there's love at first sight.

359
00:26:57,074 --> 00:26:58,284
Me, too.

360
00:26:58,284 --> 00:27:00,745
Did you look at some guy and said,
"Fuck, I love this guy"

361
00:27:00,745 --> 00:27:03,372
- The first day.
- Did it work out?

362
00:27:03,372 --> 00:27:05,041
- We got married.
- You got married?

363
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:08,210
"But, boy... I'm one of a kind."

364
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,172
- But I'm one of...
- You can't...

365
00:27:11,172 --> 00:27:15,009
No, but, man... What happened?
I saw this and said, "Fuck, already?"

366
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:18,512
Then I remembered,
"I already felt this way."

367
00:27:18,512 --> 00:27:22,266
Don't you think he said that
because of the mistake he made and...

368
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:27,938
I think he's analyzing... Sometimes
things happen so we think about the past.

369
00:27:27,938 --> 00:27:30,191
Guys, stop it. She didn't do anything.

370
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:34,987
She was dancing like this. She was
with her friend like this. Right, Carol?

371
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:38,532
Like this. Then she said,
"I didn't like the way you were dancing."

372
00:27:38,532 --> 00:27:40,076
"Blah, blah, blah, fuck off."

373
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:44,372
- She was with her friend.
- But I think Murilo wanted something, too.

374
00:27:44,372 --> 00:27:46,624
He didn't, he was by their side.

375
00:27:46,624 --> 00:27:50,628
And João got him and said,
"I'm going to have to make you pass out."

376
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:52,922
- Did he pass out, guys?
- João's funny.

377
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:56,384
He applied a rear naked choke hold.

378
00:27:56,384 --> 00:27:57,843
João didn't love anybody.

379
00:27:57,843 --> 00:28:00,054
- That's true.
- He doesn't do anything.

380
00:28:00,054 --> 00:28:03,474
In a fight, do you break it up
or help with the beating?

381
00:28:03,474 --> 00:28:04,683
Depends on the situation.

382
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:07,103
Depends a lot on the situation.

383
00:28:07,103 --> 00:28:08,604
If they're friends, I break it up.

384
00:28:08,604 --> 00:28:11,107
Depends on where, depends on what.

385
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:12,900
I always leave.

386
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,193
Are you the one who does a beat-down?

387
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:17,113
I'm not hitting anybody.
Look at the size of this little hand.

388
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:21,534
That's true, that little hand of yours.
If you hit someone, you decapitate them.

389
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:23,828
Titto, press play... You decapitate...

390
00:28:23,828 --> 00:28:25,704
I leave, I sit in the corner. No.

391
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:26,914
Don't you get involved?

392
00:28:26,914 --> 00:28:28,999
What if they're fighting over you?

393
00:28:28,999 --> 00:28:30,584
She doesn't get involved at all.

394
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:33,087
- She's like this...
- Then sorry.

395
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:34,797
Then sorry, right, baby?

396
00:28:35,506 --> 00:28:37,925
"Easy, boys. Easy."

397
00:28:39,093 --> 00:28:42,972
In the last episode, Titto is going
to have to hook up with Carol.

398
00:28:42,972 --> 00:28:46,058
- Because there's sexual tension.
- I'd let you play video games.

399
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,143
Right.

400
00:28:47,143 --> 00:28:50,729
I don't cook, but I have "assalpão".
I know how to make "assalpão".

401
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:53,357
- What is "assalpão"?
- To bake bread?

402
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:55,526
- Isn't it "alçapão"?
- No, it's "assalpão."

403
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:56,610
What's that?

404
00:28:56,610 --> 00:29:00,114
I cook pasta with cheese...
Then I present it to the person,

405
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:03,492
"Carol Bandida? No.
Carol Bandida is super talented."

406
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:04,910
Old school.

407
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,121
The person has
a different opinion about me.

408
00:29:07,121 --> 00:29:08,164
What's this all about?

409
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:12,585
The person has a different opinion
about me. Then I do, out of the blue...

410
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:17,339
I turn the stereo on, they'd be playing
video games. I play a romantic song...

411
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:18,924
What's the romantic song?

412
00:29:18,924 --> 00:29:21,302
- We have to learn from her.
- I'm a strategist.

413
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:23,429
But would you hook up
with everybody?

414
00:29:23,429 --> 00:29:28,058
No. I would say to the DJ,
"Hi, baby, let me talk to you..."

415
00:29:28,058 --> 00:29:31,103
Do you know what I like to do
when I want to hook up with the DJ?

416
00:29:31,103 --> 00:29:33,022
I dance near his booth.

417
00:29:33,022 --> 00:29:36,400
And every time
he plays a song I really, really like,

418
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:38,110
I dance looking at him...

419
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:39,528
Seducing.

420
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:42,781
And the three second rule.
You look three seconds and look away.

421
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:45,576
I don't flirt. I say,
"Do you want it or not?"

422
00:29:48,370 --> 00:29:50,748
- What do you say?
-"Do you want it or not?"

423
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:52,917
I don't flirt either, you know?

424
00:29:52,917 --> 00:29:54,418
I don't seduce, you know?

425
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:56,504
Bro, what did I get myself into?

426
00:29:56,504 --> 00:29:58,005
I love it. I love it.

427
00:29:59,048 --> 00:30:02,218
I'm addicted to seducing.
I even seduce my friends.

428
00:30:02,218 --> 00:30:03,344
I tried seducing a guy.

429
00:30:03,344 --> 00:30:05,888
He called the cops.
He thought it was a robbery.

430
00:30:05,888 --> 00:30:08,182
Imagine him wearing a cap and a hood...

431
00:30:08,182 --> 00:30:10,643
Once I was seducing some guy
at the airport,

432
00:30:10,643 --> 00:30:12,645
he called the guard,
thought it was a robbery.

433
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:14,104
Oh, my God.

434
00:30:15,022 --> 00:30:16,649
Everybody was looking like this.

435
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:17,900
Were you wearing a hood?

436
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,401
Give me the cell phone, asshole.

437
00:30:19,401 --> 00:30:20,903
How is this seduction...

438
00:30:20,903 --> 00:30:23,113
I was looking at his package,

439
00:30:23,113 --> 00:30:28,202
he thought I was looking at his cell
phone. He said, "Take it." I said, "Easy."

440
00:30:28,202 --> 00:30:32,373
Carol, do you do it in a good mood
or in a serious way?

441
00:30:32,373 --> 00:30:34,375
No, I'm serious. I don't...

442
00:30:34,375 --> 00:30:36,126
Yeah, I can see. Really.

443
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:38,837
But when I want somebody,

444
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,632
I'm very serious. I pretend that
I don't want them.

445
00:30:41,632 --> 00:30:43,509
No, I show the person I want them.

446
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:45,386
I like discreet men.

447
00:30:45,386 --> 00:30:47,555
- House husband who goes to church.
- Really.

448
00:30:47,555 --> 00:30:50,599
I don't like those men
who dance and stuff.

449
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:51,934
Do you dance?

450
00:30:52,518 --> 00:30:54,061
More or less.

451
00:30:54,895 --> 00:30:57,231
-"But that's just me."
- But I'm old school.

452
00:30:57,231 --> 00:30:59,149
I'm one of a kind.

453
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:00,901
So, you can do it, he can't?

454
00:31:01,026 --> 00:31:04,822
But I'm nervous, I have this reputation.
Nobody does it, got it?

455
00:31:04,822 --> 00:31:10,411
Since the beginning,
Luan considers himself special. Then...

456
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:13,163
- The special one.
- He always does something like this.

457
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:16,250
When things get serious, he runs away.
You know?

458
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:18,627
- Oh, my God, I'm shocked.
- He's all talk.

459
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:19,920
So you're tough. Go.

460
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,463
It wasn't Bia's fault.

461
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:23,841
Bia did nothing. Murilo did nothing...

462
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:27,636
Luan, since the beginning, wants to be
a hero, a thug... a wise man, a thug.

463
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:32,558
He just talks and does nothing.
He's all talk.

464
00:31:32,558 --> 00:31:35,060
I think he was honest with Murilo.

465
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,646
I don't think he's a phony.
It was from the heart.

466
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:40,691
Bianca, would you accept his apology?

467
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:42,818
I would, I would.

468
00:31:42,818 --> 00:31:46,447
I would, but I'd say,
"Look, baby, you have to change,

469
00:31:46,447 --> 00:31:50,618
because like this,
we're not going to last..." I don't know.

470
00:31:50,618 --> 00:31:53,954
Bia, she forgave him,
but she's still hurt. I don't think...

471
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:55,748
Yes, that's it.

472
00:31:55,748 --> 00:31:58,334
You don't accept the apology
and that's it, right?

473
00:31:58,334 --> 00:31:59,752
But she's cool, you know?

474
00:31:59,752 --> 00:32:01,754
Everybody has a counselor friend.

475
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:04,173
- Let's watch this.
- Press play.

476
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,346
Let's go, girls. Who's going to drive?

477
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:15,559
Bye, boys. Take care.
Don't bring women over.

478
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:17,519
- You got it.
- Bye.

479
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:19,938
Think about me, baby. Think about me...

480
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:24,943
We're not going to starve.

481
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:26,111
Yeah.

482
00:32:35,704 --> 00:32:39,291
Girl, let me ask you... Luan's fight.
I had no idea what was going on.

483
00:32:39,291 --> 00:32:40,959
How did it all get started?

484
00:32:40,959 --> 00:32:42,044
Nobody got that either.

485
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:43,128
Girl, I only remember...

486
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:45,130
He got jealous of me with Murilo.

487
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:46,882
- With Murilo.
- But jealous of what?

488
00:32:46,882 --> 00:32:50,678
Of us dancing, according to him,
my ass was on Murilo's face.

489
00:32:50,678 --> 00:32:52,763
And you were next to us,
I saw everything.

490
00:32:52,763 --> 00:32:55,307
But they started to argue on the bus,

491
00:32:55,307 --> 00:32:56,517
and Murilo got angry?

492
00:32:56,517 --> 00:32:59,770
No. Luan got angry,
said he would kick Murilo's ass.

493
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:00,854
Yeah, Luan...

494
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:02,398
And Murilo faced it, girl.

495
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:06,443
Yeah, Luan started to say
a lot of things. "Fucker..."

496
00:33:06,443 --> 00:33:08,195
"Whore..." Pretty bad things.

497
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:09,988
Yeah, it was horrible, girl.

498
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,407
Did he ask to get back together?

499
00:33:11,407 --> 00:33:13,742
He did,
he wants to be with me and stuff...

500
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,369
I talked to him. He apologized.

501
00:33:15,369 --> 00:33:18,038
I don't know what to believe, you know.

502
00:33:23,585 --> 00:33:26,463
I think that's the right spot,
right? I think it fits.

503
00:33:26,463 --> 00:33:28,716
- Yeah...
- It fits.

504
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:35,723
Let's invite these guys.

505
00:33:35,723 --> 00:33:37,266
Let's invite these people.

506
00:33:37,266 --> 00:33:38,600
Let's get started.

507
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:42,396
Good afternoon.
Here's an invitation for you guys.

508
00:33:42,396 --> 00:33:46,400
This party is tonight, at the lagoon,
downtown, at 7:00 p.m.

509
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,194
Hi, boys. Are you all right?

510
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:53,907
I know you can't take these flyers,
but I wanted to invite you, okay?

511
00:33:53,907 --> 00:33:55,826
It's just... We're surfing, right?

512
00:33:55,826 --> 00:33:59,037
Yeah, it's difficult, it's okay.

513
00:34:01,248 --> 00:34:02,958
Where are they keeping the flyers?

514
00:34:02,958 --> 00:34:05,127
But he could listen to it, at least.

515
00:34:05,127 --> 00:34:08,172
We could drop this over there, real close.

516
00:34:11,884 --> 00:34:14,178
There are cool people. There's cheap food.

517
00:34:20,517 --> 00:34:22,436
It's worth it, watching the sunset.

518
00:34:22,436 --> 00:34:24,605
And touch the ocean.

519
00:34:24,605 --> 00:34:26,023
And touch...

520
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:35,032
Let's go, 14, just to make sure.

521
00:34:35,032 --> 00:34:39,244
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

522
00:35:02,518 --> 00:35:04,645
- Hello, I'm home...
- Are you Blondie's friend?

523
00:35:05,521 --> 00:35:07,022
No way...

524
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:08,899
- What's up?
- Hi...

525
00:35:08,899 --> 00:35:10,567
- Welcome.
- Are the girls out?

526
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:11,985
What is going on, man?

527
00:35:12,653 --> 00:35:14,613
How are you? Nice to meet you.

528
00:35:14,613 --> 00:35:16,824
- Oh, man...
- You can leave...

529
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:19,910
- I'm going to mess things up.
- No, over there. I won't...

530
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:22,871
- She's here, bro.
- Are you okay?

531
00:35:22,871 --> 00:35:24,706
- I'm great.
- What's your name?

532
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:26,124
- Ramon. You?
- I'm Victoria.

533
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:28,168
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you...

534
00:35:28,168 --> 00:35:30,045
- How are you?

535
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:33,340
- Nice to meet you.
- Are you the famous Vic?

536
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,759
- Blondie said good things about you.
- Oh, yeah?

537
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:38,428
- Is she Blondie's friend?
- How are you, buddy?

538
00:35:38,428 --> 00:35:39,555
I smell like garlic.

539
00:35:39,555 --> 00:35:42,349
How are you? You're cooking? That's great.

540
00:35:42,349 --> 00:35:45,143
Let's do something here, right?

541
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:54,111
That's what I needed. Ocean and sunset.

542
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,031
Washed feet...

543
00:35:58,031 --> 00:36:01,910
Washed feet, washed soul.
How are you feeling about Luan?

544
00:36:02,828 --> 00:36:05,080
I don't know, I'm okay, I think.

545
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,164
You are, right?

546
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,917
I forgave him, but...

547
00:36:09,877 --> 00:36:12,504
I need to breathe. I'm hurt, you know?

548
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:13,589
Yes. You're right...

549
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:16,592
He can't make things go away
with apologies. Time will do this.

550
00:36:16,592 --> 00:36:20,679
Yeah. Even though I want to be with him,
I love myself more.

551
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:21,805
Yes... Yes.

552
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:23,348
Yesterday, I was saying,

553
00:36:23,348 --> 00:36:28,061
"People may forget what you said.
People may forget what you did.

554
00:36:28,061 --> 00:36:32,316
But they'll never forget how you
made them feel." Like, you made them feel.

555
00:36:32,316 --> 00:36:37,988
That's it. Really, you might forget.
Words are forgettable, but...

556
00:36:37,988 --> 00:36:41,450
It's just, I'm really confused.
I don't know what's true...

557
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:43,702
I don't know who is
and who isn't...

558
00:36:43,702 --> 00:36:44,995
Things got to a point...

559
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:11,396
They're here...

560
00:37:11,897 --> 00:37:13,649
We're here!

561
00:37:14,274 --> 00:37:15,984
What's up?

562
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:18,528
- Hey...
- How are you?

563
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:20,155
I want to know how you did.

564
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:21,782
We invited a lot of people.

565
00:37:21,782 --> 00:37:23,742
- Yes...
- There's food.

566
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,744
Wonderful.

567
00:37:25,744 --> 00:37:26,870
João is feeling sick.

568
00:37:26,870 --> 00:37:28,038
- Why?
- What happened?

569
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:30,374
Seems like food poisoning. I don't know.

570
00:37:33,126 --> 00:37:36,546
Baby... I got you a gift, a shirt.

571
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,507
Good night, good morning.

572
00:37:38,507 --> 00:37:40,133
Poor thing, he's calling you.

573
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:43,512
What? It's the Tiger Room,
he's with Joyce.

574
00:37:45,347 --> 00:37:46,974
What is it?

575
00:37:46,974 --> 00:37:48,850
Is he with someone?

576
00:37:57,985 --> 00:37:59,611
This is Joãozinho.

577
00:38:05,951 --> 00:38:08,203
Girl, I missed you!

578
00:38:14,251 --> 00:38:15,419
Girl...

579
00:38:18,171 --> 00:38:19,881
Blondie's arm.

580
00:38:22,843 --> 00:38:24,511
Girl!

581
00:38:25,971 --> 00:38:28,140
Boss sent an audio message.

582
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:31,393
- Look, time to work.
- Let's listen to it.

583
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:38,025
- Is everybody paying attention?
- Everybody.

584
00:38:38,025 --> 00:38:39,818
Hi, what's up?
Today's the big day.

585
00:38:39,818 --> 00:38:41,737
Our party is tonight.

586
00:38:41,737 --> 00:38:46,616
I wanted to thank all of you
for your hard work with promotion.

587
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:52,372
And the work is not done yet. I need
four of you to help me out at the bar.

588
00:38:52,372 --> 00:38:57,335
Nathalia, Taynara, Luan and Ramon
are going to work.

589
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:00,005
The rest of you can come over
and have fun.

590
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:02,007
- Fuck it.
- Motherfucker.

591
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:28,283
- Do you have those black torn jeans?
- Yeah.

592
00:39:29,326 --> 00:39:32,537
So I'm going to borrow them.
Okay? Gorgeous.

593
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:57,562
Hit it!

594
00:39:57,562 --> 00:39:59,189
Go for it, bro!

595
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:04,111
- Yes, man!
- Fuck!

596
00:40:04,111 --> 00:40:05,695
Just in time, man.

597
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:11,618
Fuck, brother. Fuck, man.

598
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:13,745
- My brother.
- Man...

599
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:17,582
Damn.

600
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:22,587
That's it, man. I fucking love you, man.

601
00:40:23,004 --> 00:40:24,297
How are you, my man?

602
00:40:24,297 --> 00:40:26,466
- Nice to meet you. I'm Murilo.
- I'm Tomás.

603
00:40:28,135 --> 00:40:30,095
Welcome. Fuck!

604
00:40:30,095 --> 00:40:31,263
- Fuck!
- That's it!

605
00:40:31,263 --> 00:40:33,348
- This shit is good.
- What the fuck?

606
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:40,981
No, man, I did the shit
and it worked, man.

607
00:40:40,981 --> 00:40:42,149
Man...

608
00:40:42,149 --> 00:40:44,317
It worked, man.

609
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:48,989
- Damn, man...
- Damn!

610
00:40:48,989 --> 00:40:51,992
He's identical. He's very similar.

611
00:40:51,992 --> 00:40:55,495
Is she your girl? Nice to meet you,
I'm Tomás. Everything's great.

612
00:40:55,495 --> 00:40:56,872
Man... Fuck you, dude.

613
00:40:56,872 --> 00:41:00,000
Easy, let me get things straight.
What? What is it...

614
00:41:01,918 --> 00:41:04,212
Fuck, you're identical, man.

615
00:41:06,173 --> 00:41:07,924
Let me see what's going on.

616
00:41:07,924 --> 00:41:10,719
I'm drinking a lot. Let's see.
You're tense...

617
00:41:12,888 --> 00:41:14,306
You guys are drunk...

618
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:15,724
- Come here.
- Let's go there.

619
00:41:15,724 --> 00:41:16,975
Are you going together?

620
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:18,226
I'm going with you.

621
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:20,395
- Blondie, let me introduce you.
- Hi...

622
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:23,440
- Are you João's brother?
- Yes, I am. I'm Tomás, how are you?

623
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:25,025
He's talked a lot about you.

624
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,693
- Vic got here today, too.
- How are you?

625
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:29,029
- Did you get here today?
- She's my best friend.

626
00:41:29,029 --> 00:41:32,073
- How are you?
- Great. Nice to meet you.

627
00:41:32,073 --> 00:41:35,493
- Blondie!
- Go take a picture of you guys. Go.

628
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:37,329
Let's go, everybody. Come...

629
00:41:38,205 --> 00:41:39,998
Go there...

630
00:41:43,168 --> 00:41:44,502
Yeah...

631
00:41:49,758 --> 00:41:53,094
Let's go, let's go. That's it.

632
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:57,015
Yes, man. João's happy, did you see it?

633
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:17,869
That's great.

634
00:42:20,455 --> 00:42:21,957
- They're here.
- They're here.

635
00:42:21,957 --> 00:42:23,792
We're here. You can't, man.

636
00:42:29,005 --> 00:42:30,298
Are you excited?

637
00:42:30,298 --> 00:42:32,842
We're very excited... to start drinking.

638
00:42:32,842 --> 00:42:33,843
I'm drinking for you, girl.

639
00:42:33,843 --> 00:42:37,597
- Yeah, drink for me.
- You come here with us.

640
00:42:37,597 --> 00:42:38,723
What's your name?

641
00:42:38,848 --> 00:42:40,433
- Yeah...
- Renata.

642
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:43,019
Renata? Tomás... And you?

643
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:44,688
- Luará.
- Luará?

644
00:42:44,688 --> 00:42:47,023
- That's it...
- I'm still learning.

645
00:42:47,023 --> 00:42:48,525
You toasted, you drink it...

646
00:42:48,525 --> 00:42:50,610
You can use the straw. You could also...

647
00:42:51,820 --> 00:42:53,280
This way, look, let's do it.

648
00:43:08,128 --> 00:43:09,921
Yeah!

649
00:43:10,714 --> 00:43:12,424
Jeez, what a wonderful kiss.

650
00:43:13,508 --> 00:43:16,011
- Cheers to us.
- Thanks for giving me...

651
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:19,139
Just the beginning.
Take it easy, the best part comes later.

652
00:43:20,849 --> 00:43:24,644
Hey, hey, hey. Wait a minute,
wait a minute, wait a minute.

653
00:43:24,644 --> 00:43:29,983
I wonder if there's anybody thirsty...
Does anybody want to begin with shots?

654
00:43:29,983 --> 00:43:32,110
Shot! Shot! Shot! Shot!

655
00:43:32,235 --> 00:43:34,321
I want to hear it... Who wants shots?

656
00:43:34,321 --> 00:43:36,990
Do you want a shot?

657
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:39,451
Pour me one. Who wants shots?

658
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:41,244
Who wants shots?
Come here, Blondie.

659
00:43:51,504 --> 00:43:53,173
Ouch...

660
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,722
Stick your tongue out.

661
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:07,687
Guys, guys. Listen up, the work is done.

662
00:44:09,814 --> 00:44:13,943
Fuck! We're coming!

663
00:44:32,087 --> 00:44:35,548
Let's go. Let's get this thing started...

664
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:46,684
Ramon, Ramon.

665
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,729
Do you know what I wanted to do to you?

666
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:53,358
I wanted to fuck the hell out of you.

667
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:59,072
Do you think I didn't want that, too?

668
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:02,325
Where there's a will, there's a way.

669
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:05,370
- There's not.
- Why, guys? I'm just saying.

670
00:45:09,624 --> 00:45:11,835
Blondie, kiss him.

671
00:45:12,669 --> 00:45:13,670
Hey...

672
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:16,423
Go, Blondie...
Kiss him, Blondie. Go, Blondie.

673
00:45:30,145 --> 00:45:33,731
I know that, for you,
that's the only way that works...

674
00:45:33,731 --> 00:45:35,525
I'm going to lick you.

675
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:03,511
That's beautiful. You pervert.

676
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:43,092
Hey, guys! Guys! Where are the boys?

677
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:46,679
Let's go to the afterparty.

678
00:47:06,157 --> 00:47:07,158
Hey, but then...

679
00:47:07,158 --> 00:47:09,953
Tonight you're going to make
both of them smile.

680
00:47:09,953 --> 00:47:12,247
Let me borrow a jacket.

681
00:47:12,247 --> 00:47:15,416
Take a look here... We're here, let's go.

682
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:16,501
Go...

683
00:47:18,086 --> 00:47:20,421
- Come on, Tomás.
- Go, Tomás.

684
00:47:22,006 --> 00:47:26,386
We're home, guys,
beautiful people... I even fell.

685
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:31,266
- Here's the toast.
- Look there.

686
00:47:37,313 --> 00:47:40,525
That's crazy, man.
I'm never getting out of here.

687
00:47:40,525 --> 00:47:42,277
Hey, Luanzinho...

688
00:47:42,277 --> 00:47:43,778
Gossip, man...

689
00:47:43,778 --> 00:47:45,530
Let's eat, for Christ's sake.

690
00:47:45,530 --> 00:47:46,948
Hey, boozer.

691
00:47:46,948 --> 00:47:51,035
What is it? I even got shy.

692
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:54,289
My girl is nervous.
Let me see one thing here...

693
00:47:54,289 --> 00:47:56,666
I even got shy. Are you crazy?

694
00:48:05,466 --> 00:48:07,051
Come, come, come...

695
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:08,970
Bro...

696
00:48:08,970 --> 00:48:11,806
I know, I trust your potential.
Turn a little bit. Go...

697
00:48:13,308 --> 00:48:14,976
Let me see it. Girl, I can't.

698
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:16,936
- I'll hold you.
- Did I tell you to stay?

699
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:18,396
Come.

700
00:48:19,814 --> 00:48:21,524
Jeez, what a shame, Blondie.

701
00:48:22,942 --> 00:48:24,319
You're fucking both of them.

702
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:25,862
Hold on to that string, girl.

703
00:48:25,862 --> 00:48:27,071
I turned too much.

704
00:48:27,071 --> 00:48:30,116
Go, go.
Do you want to take these heels off?

705
00:48:30,116 --> 00:48:34,704
Do you want to take a shower?
No? So, let's go to bed.

706
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:38,041
Girl, I'm sad.

707
00:48:38,041 --> 00:48:40,209
- Why are you sad?
- Because I'm wasted.

708
00:48:40,209 --> 00:48:42,712
Do you have PJs or not? Do you have PJs?

709
00:48:42,712 --> 00:48:45,673
Sit over there. Come on.

710
00:48:47,008 --> 00:48:49,177
What are you doing here, DJ?

711
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:52,472
- What are you doing here?
- Wasn't it the opposite?

712
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:08,321
You see? I take care.

713
00:49:08,321 --> 00:49:10,073
I don't see it, girl.

714
00:49:10,073 --> 00:49:12,200
You see it... If I see it, I stop you.

715
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,118
I don't see it.

716
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:15,912
- Hey, Luan.
- Ramon...

717
00:49:15,912 --> 00:49:18,122
Luan, tell your brother to go there, man.

718
00:49:18,122 --> 00:49:20,500
I can't even leave the kitchen because...

719
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:26,130
This guard is worse than SWAT.
"Against the wall. You punk!"

720
00:49:26,130 --> 00:49:27,757
Against the wall.

721
00:49:27,757 --> 00:49:29,342
I can't even pass, girl.

722
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:31,844
I'm clean, I'm clean.

723
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:33,346
Go ahead.

724
00:49:33,346 --> 00:49:35,848
- What's up?
- You're crazy. Why am I wrong?

725
00:49:35,848 --> 00:49:38,851
Don't take the bait...
Because he takes the bait, you don't.

726
00:49:39,394 --> 00:49:41,020
- Why am I wrong?
- I'm fucking cool.

727
00:49:45,608 --> 00:49:47,652
Girl, where are you?

728
00:49:48,986 --> 00:49:49,987
No... I don't know.

729
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:52,323
But, Bia, go have fun, relax. Easy.

730
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,742
- Bia. Go there...
- What is it?

731
00:50:00,957 --> 00:50:03,126
What's going on? Why did you call me?

732
00:50:03,126 --> 00:50:04,210
I called you to eat.

733
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:07,422
No, Nath called me, "Bia, go downstairs,
something's going on."

734
00:50:07,422 --> 00:50:08,548
What's going on?

735
00:50:08,673 --> 00:50:10,383
Come here and see.

736
00:50:11,843 --> 00:50:15,596
I'm with Ramon in the kitchen.
I made us two burgers.

737
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:17,557
Okay. Let's see what's going on.

738
00:50:17,557 --> 00:50:19,475
He's making a burger for you.

739
00:50:19,475 --> 00:50:21,853
- Then why did you call me?
- For you to...

740
00:50:21,853 --> 00:50:24,105
- Why did you say, "Go downstairs"?
- To eat.

741
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:26,941
Baby, what is it? Look, look.
Stop freaking out, baby.

742
00:50:26,941 --> 00:50:29,861
- Man, I'm out of patience.
- Look. Hey, stop freaking out.

743
00:50:29,861 --> 00:50:31,946
I'm out of patience, man.

744
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:34,991
Tell Nath to drop
the bullshit 'cause something's wrong.

745
00:50:34,991 --> 00:50:38,953
Baby, there's nothing.
Stop it, look at me.

746
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:42,790
- You're crazy.
- I'm not crazy.

747
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:45,543
- If there's one thing I'm not is crazy.
- Then stop it.

748
00:50:45,543 --> 00:50:47,545
I'm going to see what happened.

749
00:50:47,545 --> 00:50:49,088
Talk to her, go.

750
00:50:50,256 --> 00:50:52,008
Do you see what she's doing?

751
00:50:57,805 --> 00:51:00,850
He said,
"Look at the watchdog here, the SWAT."

752
00:51:00,850 --> 00:51:02,393
- Go...
- What?

753
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,104
Why did you tell me
to go downstairs?

754
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:08,316
Luan didn't do anything.

755
00:51:08,316 --> 00:51:10,860
Girl, I told you. For the second time,

756
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:14,030
I won't say it a third time,
don't mess with me.

757
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:15,114
I'm not messing.

758
00:51:15,114 --> 00:51:20,495
Why did you tell me, "Bia, go downstairs.
Bia, go downstairs."? Why then?

759
00:51:20,495 --> 00:51:22,330
Blondie's friend is in the pool.

760
00:51:22,330 --> 00:51:25,792
Then João's brother said, "Go over there."

761
00:51:25,792 --> 00:51:29,337
I held him and said, "Where are you going?
You're going nowhere."

762
00:51:29,337 --> 00:51:32,381
Then I said, "Brother,
you're going to stay with me."

763
00:51:32,381 --> 00:51:37,637
He said, "Girl, I won't do a thing."
He doesn't want to do anything, but...

764
00:51:37,637 --> 00:51:40,890
Girl, you're wrong. Again, you're wrong.

765
00:51:40,890 --> 00:51:43,017
Do you understand my point of view?

766
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:46,813
Girl, pay attention.
You're drunk, I get it.

767
00:51:46,813 --> 00:51:51,317
But the way you said,
"Bia, go downstairs, go downstairs.

768
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:54,695
Bia, go downstairs,"
I imagined a lot of bad things.

769
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:55,780
Okay...

770
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:59,325
Why didn't you tell me the truth?
"Bia..." Got it? Now I understand.

771
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:00,451
The way you spoke to me,

772
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:01,911
I wasn't getting anything.

773
00:52:01,911 --> 00:52:05,289
That is not the way to talk to somebody,
especially me.

774
00:52:05,289 --> 00:52:07,542
Don't you know me? Do you get it?

775
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:11,712
Because... I mean,
you've created an unnecessary situation.

776
00:52:11,712 --> 00:52:12,839
Oh, no, man...

777
00:52:12,839 --> 00:52:16,300
I thought about a lot of bad things,
the way you spoke to me.

778
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:19,095
Know how to talk to me. Got it? That's it.

779
00:52:19,095 --> 00:52:23,099
- Oh, no... I'm out of here.
- I'm not arguing with you, girl.

780
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:26,644
I'm just trying to explain
that you already know me.

781
00:52:26,644 --> 00:52:29,689
You don't have to talk to me that way.

782
00:52:29,689 --> 00:52:31,357
Don't talk to me that way either.

783
00:52:31,357 --> 00:52:33,067
Exactly. But then... You...

784
00:52:33,067 --> 00:52:36,320
The same way you didn't like the way
I spoke to you.

785
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:38,072
You talk like something's
going on here.

786
00:52:38,072 --> 00:52:43,452
Wait, Bia, shut up.
Bro, I see what's going on.

787
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:46,289
You'll see... Then you'll see.

788
00:52:46,289 --> 00:52:49,166
I did what a friend should do,
so don't talk shit to me...

789
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,626
You said, "Go downstairs."

790
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:52,044
What did I do?

791
00:52:52,044 --> 00:52:53,129
You didn't do anything.

792
00:52:53,129 --> 00:52:55,590
You told me.
You said, "Go downstairs, Bia."

793
00:52:55,590 --> 00:52:58,593
Exactly. Not because of him.
Was it because of you?

794
00:52:58,593 --> 00:52:59,594
Then, what?

795
00:52:59,594 --> 00:53:00,887
The chick checked me out,
I didn't see it.

796
00:53:00,887 --> 00:53:03,431
People were annoying Luan,

797
00:53:03,431 --> 00:53:06,100
saying he wanted to hook up
with somebody. He didn't.

798
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:09,520
I held him... Am I lying?
I held him and said,

799
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:13,065
"He's not going to hook up with anybody."

800
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:15,276
"She's with the SWAT.
She's a cop."

801
00:53:15,276 --> 00:53:17,737
"Yes, 'cause Bia is my friend."
Am I lying?

802
00:53:17,737 --> 00:53:20,072
Why didn't you explain
this to me upstairs?

803
00:53:20,072 --> 00:53:23,326
When you went upstairs,
why didn't you tell me?

804
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:27,413
I'd rather the attitude of a woman,
of a friend.

805
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:31,208
Stop it, you pointed your finger at me.
You pointed your finger at me.

806
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,127
- Fuck you.
- You don't get to say that.

807
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:37,298
You don't get to say "fuck you."
You have to learn to talk...

808
00:53:37,298 --> 00:53:40,509
You have to learn to keep your voice down.

809
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:45,014
To respect people 'cause you're like this.

810
00:53:45,014 --> 00:53:46,098
It's very different.

811
00:53:46,098 --> 00:53:47,391
Nath, to the living room.

812
00:53:47,391 --> 00:53:49,644
Go away! And you have to respect...

813
00:53:49,644 --> 00:53:51,812
Learn to be polite, and talk...

814
00:53:51,812 --> 00:53:53,230
Let's go. Bia...

815
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:56,192
Fuck it. She has to learn
how to deal with people.

816
00:53:56,192 --> 00:53:57,318
Stop cursing, please.

817
00:53:57,318 --> 00:54:01,572
I'm like this. I respect her,
she has to learn how to respect me.

818
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:05,451
She doesn't know how to talk to me.
It was awful.

819
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:09,455
Again, that was unnecessary.
It's the second time that this happened.

820
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:10,581
There's no third time.

821
00:54:10,581 --> 00:54:13,250
You said... Luan, get out of my way.

822
00:54:23,302 --> 00:54:24,804
Fuck you!

823
00:54:24,804 --> 00:54:26,305
Stop it, Nath... Hey...

824
00:54:32,603 --> 00:54:35,481
Being a friend doesn't involve hooking up
with my man...

825
00:54:35,898 --> 00:54:39,276
Now the shit is going to hit the fan.
There's going to be a fight.

826
00:54:39,276 --> 00:54:40,361
I want to see this fight.

827
00:54:40,361 --> 00:54:44,573
We've been talking about this for a while,
and Bia was suspicious.

828
00:54:44,573 --> 00:54:47,034
Not something only people
outside the house notice.

829
00:54:47,034 --> 00:54:49,078
If she wanted to steal her man...

830
00:54:49,078 --> 00:54:53,791
Girl, but why is she trying
to make all this trouble?

831
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:55,918
Did you see what she's just done?

832
00:54:55,918 --> 00:54:57,586
That's what I'm talking about.

833
00:54:57,586 --> 00:54:59,171
I understand.

834
00:54:59,171 --> 00:55:02,925
We're not the only people talking about
this thing since the beginning.

835
00:55:02,925 --> 00:55:03,926
Bia and Luan...

836
00:55:03,926 --> 00:55:07,388
Since the beginning we've noticed
something between Luan and Nathalia.

837
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:10,141
She noticed the same thing?
There's something going on.

838
00:55:10,141 --> 00:55:11,976
If she did that thing downstairs,

839
00:55:11,976 --> 00:55:14,562
she didn't have to go upstairs
to make that other chick

840
00:55:14,562 --> 00:55:17,940
fight Victoria because of Luan.
She'd already sorted it out.

841
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:20,151
Bro, she likes to cause trouble.

842
00:55:20,151 --> 00:55:23,612
So, I think she didn't intend
that fight between Luan and her.

843
00:55:23,612 --> 00:55:24,697
She explained later,

844
00:55:24,697 --> 00:55:28,743
even Luan agreed with her,
separate Luan from those girls...

845
00:55:28,743 --> 00:55:30,244
That chick was in the pool.

846
00:55:30,244 --> 00:55:33,873
"I'm going to tell my friend
to grab her man

847
00:55:33,873 --> 00:55:35,291
'cause they're hitting on him."

848
00:55:35,291 --> 00:55:38,836
- No, it's not that. I'm...
- It was wrong.

849
00:55:38,836 --> 00:55:42,548
Don't talk to me like that.
Don't point your finger at me.

850
00:55:42,548 --> 00:55:44,884
- Wake up.
- Get your finger out of my face.

851
00:55:44,884 --> 00:55:45,968
What a mess.

852
00:55:46,093 --> 00:55:47,511
- Wake up.
- What a mess.

853
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:49,680
Everything happened at that afterparty.

854
00:55:49,805 --> 00:55:53,476
Who do you think is right and wrong
in this whole story?

855
00:55:54,185 --> 00:55:58,814
I think Luan, this time,
as hard as it looks, didn't do anything.

856
00:55:58,814 --> 00:56:00,941
But it's Luan's girlfriend
with his friend.

857
00:56:00,941 --> 00:56:04,070
Was Luan in favor of his friend?
He defended his friend.

858
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:05,154
What?

859
00:56:05,154 --> 00:56:07,364
Girl... No, he held her. He held her.

860
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:10,284
Who was wrong? It wasn't Bia.
Why would he hold Bia?

861
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:13,996
Bia was telling what happened.
She was telling the truth, got it?

862
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:16,332
No, he wasn't by her side. Facts.

863
00:56:16,332 --> 00:56:18,667
Bia is the most sensible, man.

864
00:56:18,667 --> 00:56:19,752
She is.

865
00:56:19,752 --> 00:56:23,255
She's drunk, the mess begins.
"Not now. Later. I'm already drunk."

866
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:25,549
Did you see who was holding Bia?

867
00:56:25,549 --> 00:56:27,384
It was Ramon.

868
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,469
Ramon.

869
00:56:28,469 --> 00:56:31,680
Ramon held Bia.
The one who held Nathalia was Luan.

870
00:56:32,348 --> 00:56:33,516
Swinging.

871
00:56:33,516 --> 00:56:36,435
Girl, I didn't see any of that.
The way I saw it,

872
00:56:36,435 --> 00:56:39,063
"I'm going to hold this chick.
She's more drunk than Bia."

873
00:56:39,063 --> 00:56:40,898
I'm going to tell you this...

874
00:56:40,898 --> 00:56:43,067
- And Bia said a lot of things...
- I...

875
00:56:43,067 --> 00:56:44,151
Bia...

876
00:56:44,151 --> 00:56:48,572
Give it up to Victoria, who barely said
a thing and got a lot of attention.

877
00:56:48,572 --> 00:56:50,699
It's my fancy applause.

878
00:56:50,699 --> 00:56:52,660
She was expecting
to be defended by Luan.

879
00:56:53,536 --> 00:56:54,537
ON THE NEXT EPISODE

880
00:56:54,537 --> 00:56:57,081
Welcome to our humble home.

881
00:56:57,081 --> 00:56:58,332
Is this your boyfriend?

882
00:56:58,332 --> 00:57:01,502
My man. Yes, he's a very good person.
You have to meet him.

883
00:57:02,128 --> 00:57:03,963
Fuck you, man.

884
00:57:10,052 --> 00:57:12,304
You know? Get out, bro.

885
00:57:12,304 --> 00:57:14,557
Come on, easy.

886
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:17,935
I want to watch it now.

887
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:19,395
There are a lot of men...

888
00:57:19,395 --> 00:57:21,897
That wasn't a fight. That was messy.

889
00:57:21,897 --> 00:57:22,982
I'm afraid of Murilo

890
00:57:22,982 --> 00:57:24,441
when he gets angry...

891
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:26,193
Me, too... I think it's beautiful.

892
00:57:26,193 --> 00:57:27,695
I was sure this was going
to cause trouble.

893
00:57:27,695 --> 00:57:28,779
I was sure, man.

894
00:57:28,779 --> 00:57:31,365
Do you know the good thing
about group fighting?

895
00:57:31,365 --> 00:57:34,118
- The boys from the house stick together.
- Of course.

896
00:57:34,118 --> 00:57:36,412
The girls from the house
always stick together.

897
00:57:36,412 --> 00:57:37,580
It's a mess...

898
00:57:37,580 --> 00:57:39,665
I can say bad things about my friend,
you can't.

899
00:57:39,665 --> 00:57:41,667
Everybody sticks together.

900
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:43,836
- Let's go... What now?
- What a mess.

901
00:57:43,836 --> 00:57:46,130
How are we going to spend the whole week?

902
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:48,048
Guys, I won't be able to sleep.

903
00:57:48,048 --> 00:57:49,049
To watch this mess.

904
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:50,467
- Guys.
- Guys...

905
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:54,972
I love that I came here to watch this with
you, but I have to pick up my daughters.

906
00:57:54,972 --> 00:57:56,056
Who's doing the dishes?

907
00:57:56,056 --> 00:57:58,142
I'm not, honey.
I don't have to do it.

908
00:57:58,142 --> 00:58:00,603
Imagine her showing up
like this at day care...
