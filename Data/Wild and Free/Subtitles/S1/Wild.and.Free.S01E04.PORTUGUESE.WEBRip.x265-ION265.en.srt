1
00:00:15,725 --> 00:00:16,726
I'm super excited!

2
00:00:16,726 --> 00:00:17,768
WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS
THE REVIEW

3
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,061
- Yep, me, too!
- Me, too.

4
00:00:19,061 --> 00:00:20,062
All good?

5
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,856
- What's up?
- How are you doing?

6
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:22,857
Hey, hi!

7
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:24,275
So, are you ready to start?

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,609
- I'm excited.
- What's happening?

9
00:00:25,735 --> 00:00:26,736
A lot has happened.

10
00:00:26,736 --> 00:00:28,946
Bia had an argument with Luan...

11
00:00:28,946 --> 00:00:30,614
Luan slept on the couch...

12
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:32,283
It's a circus. I'm shocked.

13
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:33,242
What a mess.

14
00:00:33,242 --> 00:00:36,078
I was shipping this couple
and now I'm un-shipping them.

15
00:00:36,078 --> 00:00:37,788
- Hit play.
- With my heel.

16
00:00:37,788 --> 00:00:39,206
Hit that play, Bia.

17
00:00:39,206 --> 00:00:40,541
I love that play.

18
00:00:49,258 --> 00:00:51,051
He slept in the living room.

19
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:54,180
- He slept in the living room.
- Luan.

20
00:00:54,305 --> 00:00:55,097
He slept

21
00:00:55,097 --> 00:00:56,432
in the living room.

22
00:00:56,432 --> 00:00:57,725
My boy over there.

23
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,602
- He got burned.
- João's not yours?

24
00:00:59,602 --> 00:01:01,771
- No, it's Luan, I've changed.
- Okay.

25
00:01:01,771 --> 00:01:03,355
Who's coming downstairs?

26
00:01:03,355 --> 00:01:04,315
She is.

27
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:06,025
- Yes, it's her.
- It's her.

28
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:09,320
Yeah, she woke up like Carol,
wearing shades... Got it?

29
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:11,030
She wakes up like Carol.

30
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,532
She turned around.
She saw him and bounced.

31
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:16,744
Jeez, she saw him and turned around.

32
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:19,497
- Rewind this.
- I wonder if there is.

33
00:01:19,497 --> 00:01:21,415
She went there like this,

34
00:01:21,415 --> 00:01:24,794
"I'm hungry, I want bread and coffee.
Oops, the loser!"

35
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:26,629
"I won't start my day like this."

36
00:01:29,965 --> 00:01:33,135
Murilo is hooking up with her.
My boyfriend.

37
00:01:33,135 --> 00:01:34,303
That's my couple, let me in.

38
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:35,805
- I'm kidding.
- Pabllo's boy.

39
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:38,516
Murilo, you are my boy. Know this.

40
00:01:38,808 --> 00:01:40,309
I loved that little room.

41
00:01:40,309 --> 00:01:42,186
Guys, my makeup! My brand.

42
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:43,270
Is that your makeup?

43
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,271
I knew it, man.

44
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,273
I knew there was an Easter egg.

45
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,191
Thanks, guys.

46
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:49,443
This is so Amazon Prime,
there's an Easter egg.

47
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,528
Thanks, guys.

48
00:01:50,528 --> 00:01:51,445
Forget it.

49
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,905
Forget it, no worries.

50
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:55,616
I slept alone,
didn't have breakfast with you guys.

51
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:57,201
I'm not going to stay in this vibe.

52
00:01:57,201 --> 00:01:58,536
Keep that vibe.

53
00:01:58,536 --> 00:02:01,205
I like seeing you like that.
Telling it like it is.

54
00:02:01,205 --> 00:02:03,457
Drama queen.

55
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,542
I think it's cool he says "vibe."

56
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:07,920
I find "vibe" to be a cool word.
"Vibe" is like "top."

57
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:10,297
"Vibe" is similar to "top."

58
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,675
I don't know what to say,
I say, "What a vibe."

59
00:02:12,675 --> 00:02:13,759
What a vibe.

60
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:14,718
It won't ever come out of my mouth.

61
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,220
Neither "vibe" nor "top."

62
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,513
This show is "top."

63
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:18,681
Topper is better.

64
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:22,101
I think men always have
a partnership like that.

65
00:02:22,101 --> 00:02:24,144
But women, too.

66
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,354
See how all of them are united?

67
00:02:25,354 --> 00:02:26,438
I hope so.

68
00:02:26,438 --> 00:02:27,523
Putting on makeup...

69
00:02:27,523 --> 00:02:29,066
- Yeah. What?
- Even the...

70
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,943
I think men are more united.

71
00:02:30,943 --> 00:02:32,194
Yeah, it's obvious.

72
00:02:32,194 --> 00:02:34,530
Sadly, we hold grudges
because we're more dramatic.

73
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:35,906
A lot more than men.

74
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:38,075
- What do you guys think?
- What? I think...

75
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,537
Women are better...
So, women are mentally faster.

76
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:42,830
He didn't even drink...

77
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:45,207
It's too much Red Bull. Mentally faster.

78
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:46,584
They organize things better.

79
00:02:46,584 --> 00:02:49,753
They don't take over the world
because they fight amongst themselves.

80
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:51,672
- Gay people, too.
- It's true.

81
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:52,756
Gays are united.

82
00:02:52,756 --> 00:02:54,592
Women don't take over the world...

83
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:55,509
...because they are jealous...

84
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:58,304
Gay people still are,
but there's a part which is not.

85
00:02:58,304 --> 00:02:59,513
There's a separation everywhere.

86
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,556
Guys are like this.

87
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:01,849
They mess up with each other...

88
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,350
But women? What?

89
00:03:03,350 --> 00:03:04,768
- Gay people don't.
- That's true.

90
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:08,105
But gay people are not totally united.
Jesus Christ!

91
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:09,023
Yeah, so...

92
00:03:09,023 --> 00:03:11,442
Mess with João
and see if I don't take Pabllo's wig off.

93
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,110
That's gossip.

94
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,862
Everything has to be discussed.

95
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:17,197
Since he said he's going
to change his vibe,

96
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:19,325
he'll be a good person. Let's wait.

97
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:20,659
- I think so.
- Yeah...

98
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:21,994
He's got to know
if Nathalia's into it,

99
00:03:21,994 --> 00:03:23,829
I think she's not. She's upset...

100
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:25,247
Girl, it's obvious.

101
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:27,750
That pretty girl,
in the middle of the others...

102
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,834
He made a scene.

103
00:03:28,834 --> 00:03:32,296
Do you guys think
he's going to hook up with her friend?

104
00:03:32,296 --> 00:03:33,464
I don't think so.

105
00:03:33,464 --> 00:03:35,883
Well, girls,
I was talking to the guys here...

106
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:37,426
I was talking to the guys here

107
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:38,677
and I apologized, okay?

108
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:41,013
I was out of line with you, too.
I'm sorry.

109
00:03:41,013 --> 00:03:42,932
Let me give you a hug.
I want us to be good.

110
00:03:42,932 --> 00:03:45,225
Let me kiss you...

111
00:03:45,225 --> 00:03:46,310
He's fixing it.

112
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,520
You see? Women hold a grudge.

113
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,898
You say, "I fucked up, do you forgive me?"

114
00:03:50,898 --> 00:03:53,233
"Are you mad at me, baby?" "No, I'm not."

115
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:55,194
"No, I'm not mad. Be cool..."

116
00:03:55,194 --> 00:03:56,820
Yeah, I think so, too.

117
00:03:56,820 --> 00:03:58,155
No! I don't forget it.

118
00:03:58,155 --> 00:03:59,740
I'll tell you something.

119
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,825
This season will end,
and she's going to rub it in his face.

120
00:04:01,951 --> 00:04:02,868
Exactly.

121
00:04:02,868 --> 00:04:04,411
- Look at the face.
- You see?

122
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:06,538
The guy laughed, and she's very angry.

123
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,666
I told you she's like this...

124
00:04:08,666 --> 00:04:09,750
"I'm very angry."

125
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,127
Guys, does she have to smile at him?

126
00:04:12,127 --> 00:04:14,296
He's in a good mood, maybe she's not.

127
00:04:14,296 --> 00:04:16,882
Does she have to be in a good mood
right at that moment?

128
00:04:16,882 --> 00:04:18,092
Guys, think about the food.

129
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:20,386
Carrots, tomatoes,
rice, beans, and chicken.

130
00:04:20,386 --> 00:04:21,470
I loved it.

131
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:24,056
- I'm checking the food.
- You only talk about food.

132
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:25,975
They have a boat now.

133
00:04:26,183 --> 00:04:27,935
Those guys...

134
00:04:27,935 --> 00:04:28,852
I know.

135
00:04:28,852 --> 00:04:30,437
Imagine staying in a house

136
00:04:30,437 --> 00:04:32,106
with open bar, food, women, boat...

137
00:04:32,106 --> 00:04:34,358
The boat is coming with someone.

138
00:04:34,358 --> 00:04:36,860
The boat belongs to the mayor's son...

139
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:37,945
Look. No, I think...

140
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,197
Oh, my God, it's my sugar daddy. It's him.

141
00:04:40,531 --> 00:04:41,991
The owner of the boat is arriving.

142
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:43,617
He's the boat owner.

143
00:04:43,617 --> 00:04:45,744
Is it possible? Are we riding on a boat?

144
00:04:45,744 --> 00:04:47,371
I can't believe it.

145
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,789
Crazy, man.

146
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:49,999
For real? For real?

147
00:04:49,999 --> 00:04:51,959
- Who is it?
- João loves a boat, right?

148
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,377
He loves being the center of attention.

149
00:04:53,377 --> 00:04:54,920
Check out his look in the boat.

150
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,547
It's Zé Neto and Cristiano.

151
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:58,090
Does he look like him?

152
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,926
He could be gay, right?
To make that group better.

153
00:05:00,926 --> 00:05:02,636
Hi, guys, how are you doing?

154
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,179
Ladies and gents.

155
00:05:04,179 --> 00:05:06,473
- Doing good?
- Right. How are you guys?

156
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,599
Just fine.

157
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:09,226
Wow, the sheriff.

158
00:05:09,226 --> 00:05:10,686
- Did you see it?
- Yeah...

159
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:13,188
I'm Ricardo, manager of the bar
where you're going to work.

160
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:15,524
Jeez, seriously?

161
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:16,525
Yes, it is.

162
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:17,776
You like serious men like him...

163
00:05:17,776 --> 00:05:20,112
- She liked him.
- Is this the kind of guy you like?

164
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:21,613
Leave the door open
for you to go on the boat.

165
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,949
Bearded... Bearded man
from a barber shop...

166
00:05:23,949 --> 00:05:26,660
He goes to a barber shop
to get the beard oiled?

167
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:29,455
The guys were like, "Fuck, a boat!"

168
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:30,831
"I'm the manager of the bar..."

169
00:05:30,831 --> 00:05:32,041
- The guys went...
- Oops.

170
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,208
Right on time.

171
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:34,877
They thought they'd be
parading on a boat...

172
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:35,878
Who wants to work during vacation?

173
00:05:35,878 --> 00:05:37,713
I think that will be the reward.

174
00:05:37,713 --> 00:05:39,423
They're going to work, but...

175
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:40,632
...they're taking the boat.

176
00:05:40,632 --> 00:05:41,592
I hope so, right?

177
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:43,427
D-I-C-K, vacation. No one wants to work.

178
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,763
- What?
- D-I-C-K, vacation.

179
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:48,057
"D-I-C-K, VACATION"
DROPS, JOHN

180
00:05:48,057 --> 00:05:50,017
It took me some time to understand.

181
00:05:50,517 --> 00:05:51,518
Fun!

182
00:05:51,518 --> 00:05:54,855
I'd like to invite you to come see
the place. I have a boat waiting for us.

183
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,399
I already like the boss.

184
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,942
- Awesome!
- Can we go now?

185
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:00,819
- What a job!
- Now!

186
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:02,488
- All right.
- Wonderful.

187
00:06:02,488 --> 00:06:04,156
Can we drink on the job?

188
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:05,616
We'll talk about it later.

189
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:07,159
"Can we drink on the job?"

190
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,243
"Can I drink?"

191
00:06:08,243 --> 00:06:09,912
"Can we drink on the job?"

192
00:06:09,912 --> 00:06:10,996
Priorities, right?

193
00:06:10,996 --> 00:06:13,707
Even the boat's name is "Naked Moon."

194
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,084
When I go to Floripa...

195
00:06:15,084 --> 00:06:17,336
Look at their job.
He's going to work on the boat.

196
00:06:18,003 --> 00:06:19,963
My dream is having sex like this,
on high seas.

197
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:21,048
- Never?
- Never done it.

198
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,509
Stop it.
You don't know what you're missing.

199
00:06:23,509 --> 00:06:24,635
Have you done it?

200
00:06:24,635 --> 00:06:25,803
- No.
- Of course not.

201
00:06:26,345 --> 00:06:27,346
I've done it.

202
00:06:27,513 --> 00:06:28,680
Let's go to the bar.

203
00:06:29,139 --> 00:06:30,099
NAKED MOON

204
00:06:30,099 --> 00:06:31,308
- Easy now.
- Okay.

205
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:33,227
- On the sand, over there.
- Look at this.

206
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:35,395
- Guys, come on.
- That's beautiful.

207
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:38,273
I'd work wearing a bikini, serving people.

208
00:06:38,273 --> 00:06:40,067
And a wet, tied blouse like that.

209
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:42,361
I'd take a sip of each drink I served.

210
00:06:43,112 --> 00:06:47,449
But today is the only day you get
to enjoy the place, too.

211
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:51,787
Today, I'm paying the tab. It's all free.

212
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:53,789
I wish my boss said that.

213
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:56,708
Guys, the owner will have a big loss.

214
00:06:57,209 --> 00:06:58,460
Guys, that's my dream.

215
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,962
That's a wonderful job.

216
00:06:59,962 --> 00:07:01,713
They'll be registered workers?

217
00:07:01,964 --> 00:07:03,132
- No.
- Of course not.

218
00:07:03,507 --> 00:07:04,758
...going to pay them in booze?

219
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,176
Registered workers?

220
00:07:06,176 --> 00:07:07,803
One of those dudes
should be dying to work.

221
00:07:07,803 --> 00:07:08,804
But it's obvious...

222
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:11,223
I won't work here.
I'd rather work over there...

223
00:07:11,223 --> 00:07:12,141
In Mato Grosso.

224
00:07:12,141 --> 00:07:14,977
Bottom line, they work to get laid
and get laid to work.

225
00:07:14,977 --> 00:07:17,229
- Right. It's insane.
- Wild and Free.

226
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:18,564
We need someone who knows...

227
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:19,857
- Carol.
- Carol.

228
00:07:19,857 --> 00:07:20,816
Carol is a guru.

229
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:22,734
She's there, few words, few ideas...

230
00:07:22,734 --> 00:07:24,278
She says the right thing...

231
00:07:24,278 --> 00:07:25,821
What did you think about that work day?

232
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:27,531
Man, I think it's cool, right?

233
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:29,283
Once, I was sleeping at home...

234
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,784
- Carol.
- Door open...

235
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:32,202
- She's always cool.
- Door open.

236
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,079
What do you think about this episode...

237
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:35,164
I tuned the fan on.

238
00:07:35,164 --> 00:07:37,583
I found it very easy. Piece of cake.

239
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,376
Did it have to be hard?

240
00:07:39,376 --> 00:07:40,460
- Yes, it did.
- I see.

241
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,962
It's gotta be hard...

242
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:42,921
Hard work...

243
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:45,424
Carol's fan does all the hard work.

244
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:46,550
Now I got it...

245
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:48,218
That's the only thing that works hard.

246
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:50,596
I like being with you...

247
00:07:50,596 --> 00:07:54,683
We had something good going on.
Somehow, we went from heaven to hell in...

248
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:55,976
In a second.

249
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:57,019
It's cold here.

250
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:58,437
Look, it's coming back.

251
00:07:58,437 --> 00:08:00,063
That bullshit is coming back.

252
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:04,943
I need more than that, you know?
Because I'm going to end up getting hurt.

253
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:09,615
I only asked to be respected, got it?
I really...

254
00:08:09,615 --> 00:08:12,451
I just want to enjoy myself.
I just want to be happy...

255
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:14,119
Nathalia likes booze, too, see?

256
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,621
Nathalia likes it.

257
00:08:15,621 --> 00:08:16,705
It's a DTR.

258
00:08:16,705 --> 00:08:17,789
I'll tell you something...

259
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:19,416
When you make out with her...

260
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:21,418
Are you jealous?

261
00:08:25,172 --> 00:08:26,590
She's honest, I like her.

262
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,884
What did I say
at the beginning of this show?

263
00:08:28,884 --> 00:08:30,302
"Are you jealous?"

264
00:08:30,302 --> 00:08:32,763
Two days later, go...

265
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:35,474
Guys, they're having a great experience.

266
00:08:35,474 --> 00:08:37,142
- This intensifies it.
- Yeah...

267
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,852
- It's obvious.
- What?

268
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,439
Did you choke on the olive?

269
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:43,565
Dramatic pause.

270
00:08:43,565 --> 00:08:45,525
Let me say something.

271
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:50,447
First of all, it's a unique experience.
They're taking a hell of a trip.

272
00:08:50,447 --> 00:08:52,366
They're not spending any money.

273
00:08:52,366 --> 00:08:55,619
It's inevitable things get more sensitive.
So, it could be...

274
00:08:55,619 --> 00:08:56,536
More sensitive?

275
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,789
Things could happen,

276
00:08:58,789 --> 00:09:01,083
but I can't feel jealousy
for anyone in two days.

277
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,418
I'm already feeling jealous
of Mariano here...

278
00:09:03,418 --> 00:09:04,336
Why?

279
00:09:04,336 --> 00:09:06,129
He's looking at me differently.

280
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,798
Imagine on day two.

281
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,301
If I get him to come over here,
would you kiss him?

282
00:09:11,301 --> 00:09:12,678
In a heartbeat, brother.

283
00:09:12,678 --> 00:09:15,722
Guys, weren't they going to work,
for Christ's sake?

284
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:16,765
No, they're allowed to drink.

285
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:18,183
- I get it.
- Day off.

286
00:09:18,892 --> 00:09:20,936
They drink one day and work the next.

287
00:09:20,936 --> 00:09:24,564
Guys, if I had a VIP pass and a drink,
I wouldn't bother anyone.

288
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,316
That looks like a trap, huh?

289
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:29,069
"No need to ask. Just kiss me."

290
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,488
Look, it's the blonde in white pants.

291
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:32,864
Oh, yeah?

292
00:09:32,864 --> 00:09:34,491
- Are you in?
- Let's go.

293
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:37,369
I'll go with you. I'll go with you.

294
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:38,870
That one is an outsider.

295
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:39,997
Go ahead.

296
00:09:39,997 --> 00:09:41,081
Is he hiring?

297
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:42,708
There's one who's an outsider.

298
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,209
Is he hiring a guy to hit on...

299
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,419
That's the outsider...

300
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:47,045
Wearing the dark jacket.

301
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:51,008
Man! She's a fucking hurricane!

302
00:09:52,926 --> 00:09:55,220
I just don't like
that mockery, "Oh, kiss!"

303
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:57,597
- Let them kiss.
- Twelve years old.

304
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,057
There. Enough already.

305
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,559
Go ahead and talk to him.

306
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,227
- What's your name?
- I'm Thais.

307
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,270
She's shaking all over.

308
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,896
Blondie is fast.

309
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:13,280
A little game of pool... Hot weather...

310
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,489
Jeez, I'm bad at pool.

311
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:16,575
- I play well.
- This is so Pabllo playing pool.

312
00:10:16,575 --> 00:10:18,702
- Girl, I love pool.
- Really?

313
00:10:18,702 --> 00:10:19,661
Do you guys play?

314
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:20,704
I love pool, but I suck at it.

315
00:10:20,704 --> 00:10:22,789
I have a table at home,
I really play.

316
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:24,249
After this we're going to your place.

317
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,417
Let's go now!

318
00:10:25,417 --> 00:10:27,294
I'm going to pocket you.

319
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,211
I don't want...

320
00:10:28,211 --> 00:10:29,463
Making a mess in other people's houses.

321
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:30,422
Pocket it.

322
00:10:30,422 --> 00:10:31,673
That's delicious.

323
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:32,758
Yummy, right?

324
00:10:32,758 --> 00:10:33,759
I want to see it.

325
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,177
If someone says this...

326
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,012
A lot of new people...

327
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:38,096
I see two outsiders.

328
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:40,891
João hasn't hooked up with anyone yet.

329
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:43,810
I'll tell you something,
João is hiding his game.

330
00:10:44,436 --> 00:10:45,771
- Got it?
- She's beautiful.

331
00:10:45,896 --> 00:10:47,397
He's not going to hook up...

332
00:10:47,397 --> 00:10:50,901
but he's talking to a dozen girls
at the same time outside the house.

333
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:52,736
João kissed women at some parties...

334
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:54,154
It's João Drops.

335
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,655
He kissed two girls already.

336
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,990
He didn't fuck anyone.

337
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,658
He just kissed. He's there.

338
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,118
I want to know if he has a big dick.

339
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:01,328
Shut up, man.

340
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:02,996
Oops, I said it out loud.

341
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:06,666
Are you going to play games with me now?

342
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:07,793
This is no game.

343
00:11:07,793 --> 00:11:08,710
Don't you want it?

344
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:09,628
If you don't want it...

345
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:10,712
No, I do want it.

346
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:11,797
Do you?

347
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:13,632
I don't want to be an idiot.

348
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:16,259
All that acting and now
they're going to make out again.

349
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:17,594
What did I say, Mariano?

350
00:11:17,594 --> 00:11:19,429
There's no way. That's what I said.

351
00:11:19,429 --> 00:11:21,932
- That's a mistake.
- Luan is with her again.

352
00:11:21,932 --> 00:11:24,017
- They got back together.
- He kissed her.

353
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:25,185
That is love, guys.

354
00:11:25,185 --> 00:11:27,270
Now the sex is going to be better, huh?

355
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:28,939
- You see? Look.
- Yes, it is.

356
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:30,649
If Carol said it, then it'll be.

357
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:32,401
I love a kiss like that.

358
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:34,653
Wow, they nailed it, guys.

359
00:11:34,653 --> 00:11:37,531
Go, João!

360
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,241
João!

361
00:11:39,241 --> 00:11:40,867
Are they rooting for João to kiss someone?

362
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:42,244
If he won, he'd hook up with someone.

363
00:11:42,244 --> 00:11:43,829
If she doesn't win, he'll kiss her.

364
00:11:43,829 --> 00:11:44,871
Is that it?

365
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,540
Did you know? Do you remember?

366
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:47,624
Did he win?

367
00:11:47,624 --> 00:11:49,584
If he won, he'd hook up with someone.

368
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:51,628
With that girl who's playing with him.

369
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:52,712
Yeah.

370
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:55,632
She wasn't even that...

371
00:11:55,632 --> 00:11:56,716
The coolest thing,

372
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,469
he's wearing a banana shirt
and banana shorts, too.

373
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,596
- Look, João hooked...
- It's an outfit.

374
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,432
He had to win to hook up with her.

375
00:12:03,432 --> 00:12:06,435
João hooked up with a babe, bro. I'll say!

376
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:07,394
Yeah.

377
00:12:07,936 --> 00:12:09,312
Look at her. She's a babe.

378
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,274
Jeez, he has to ruin the kiss with...

379
00:12:12,274 --> 00:12:13,984
That girl is like, "Oh, my God!"

380
00:12:13,984 --> 00:12:15,068
What?

381
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:17,195
That girl is like, "What am I doing?"

382
00:12:17,195 --> 00:12:18,113
But she's cute.

383
00:12:18,113 --> 00:12:19,614
She's beautiful.

384
00:12:19,614 --> 00:12:20,657
- She's pretty.
- See?

385
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:21,658
Oh, my God.

386
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:22,909
He's going downhill...

387
00:12:22,909 --> 00:12:24,911
Things are going to get worse.

388
00:12:24,911 --> 00:12:25,871
You know when the boy...

389
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:27,122
Now it's going down...

390
00:12:41,219 --> 00:12:43,597
Let me tell you,
everyone's going to the house.

391
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:45,474
That's no shocker.

392
00:12:45,474 --> 00:12:46,641
Everyone's going...

393
00:12:46,641 --> 00:12:48,185
That girl went with them.

394
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:50,812
Really?

395
00:12:51,313 --> 00:12:53,773
- Will João get laid?
- Yep. It's tonight.

396
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:54,774
- Look.
- Ouch.

397
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,067
Is he taking her home?

398
00:12:56,067 --> 00:12:57,360
- He is.
- Go.

399
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:58,695
He's going to get laid.

400
00:12:58,695 --> 00:12:59,946
He took her. No escape.

401
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:01,907
No, what for?

402
00:13:01,907 --> 00:13:03,950
Is he going to have sex in the shower?

403
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,410
If she's going there, they'll have sex.

404
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,620
Where will they have sex?

405
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,954
He's going to have sex?

406
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:09,623
I wouldn't miss that.

407
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:10,707
That's true.

408
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,626
Who thinks he'll have sex,
raise your hand.

409
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:14,794
I think he's going to have sex...

410
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:15,712
I think it'd be right.

411
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:17,047
I don't know. I'm scared.

412
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:18,006
I think it'd be nicer.

413
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:20,550
Even if he doesn't want to,
he will because of his friends.

414
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,885
If he doesn't have sex...

415
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:23,553
You're saying the guy can't fuck anyone.

416
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:26,097
If he doesn't have sex,
you're going to order a pizza...

417
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:27,974
João Drops.

418
00:13:27,974 --> 00:13:29,976
Go, João! Have sex. Those...

419
00:13:29,976 --> 00:13:31,144
Do you know what I think?

420
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,062
They've learned on day one

421
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:33,605
they can't fight...

422
00:13:33,605 --> 00:13:35,857
- Everyone is...
- Pretend you're a friend.

423
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:37,859
Everyone's scoring.

424
00:13:37,859 --> 00:13:39,152
- Look.
- That was good.

425
00:13:39,528 --> 00:13:41,196
They are getting João's girl drunk

426
00:13:41,196 --> 00:13:42,280
...she's going to have sex with him.

427
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,574
- Yeah, I don't know.
- But she wants it.

428
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:45,951
- She wants it.
- She doesn't.

429
00:13:45,951 --> 00:13:47,994
She went there to play checkers.

430
00:13:47,994 --> 00:13:50,163
If you guys notice, João is right there.

431
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,331
Drinking, too.

432
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:52,457
Look.

433
00:13:52,457 --> 00:13:53,542
- Jack Sparrow.
- Wow.

434
00:13:53,542 --> 00:13:55,085
Who knows what satanic liquid
they're drinking.

435
00:13:55,085 --> 00:13:56,211
I wish I was...

436
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:58,129
It's Rihanna's piss. Rihanna's piss.

437
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,714
- João?
- What?

438
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:00,799
Ouch.

439
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:02,551
You're so delicious, Luan.

440
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:03,593
What is it, bro?

441
00:14:03,593 --> 00:14:05,470
Introduce your wife to them.

442
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:06,555
Look at João...

443
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:09,266
- Neiva, get over here! Neiva!
- Dear Neiva.

444
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:10,559
- Who?
- Not even a small sign, Neiva?

445
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:12,352
What's going on?

446
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:13,687
Joyce, I'm coming.

447
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:14,646
Fuck!

448
00:14:14,646 --> 00:14:15,814
Let's pause a minute to talk.

449
00:14:15,814 --> 00:14:17,107
Luan's body is beautiful!

450
00:14:17,107 --> 00:14:18,900
Luan's body is really beautiful...

451
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:21,361
You're not jealous, are you?

452
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,364
All of them are really beautiful.

453
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,992
But Luan has something. He's manly, girl.

454
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,745
- He smells good...
- I wish I could get Luan's mic.

455
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,130
Bia is nice, huh. I'll say!

456
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:42,632
That's delicious. I do the same.

457
00:14:44,134 --> 00:14:45,468
Just give me half an hour.

458
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,429
I bet nobody here can eat a raw egg.

459
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:49,556
That João doesn't want to fuck.

460
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:52,100
Yeah, bro. What "raw egg," João?
Go fuck yourself.

461
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,643
João is a pushover...

462
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:55,270
At a moment like this,
he wants to eat a raw egg?

463
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,813
- Go fuck...
- Did you hear it?

464
00:14:56,938 --> 00:14:57,939
Wow.

465
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:00,150
If you swallow a raw egg...

466
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:02,485
Obviously, I'll kiss you. Got it?

467
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:03,528
She meant...

468
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:05,655
I'd eat the shell and the egg box.

469
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,157
Oh, yeah? That's crazy.

470
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:08,992
I'd eat the whole chicken.

471
00:15:08,992 --> 00:15:11,202
I'd fuck the farm owner to fuck...

472
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:12,996
...you're going to fuck anyone but me.

473
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:14,456
His mouth would stink.

474
00:15:14,456 --> 00:15:16,791
Just brush your teeth.

475
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,835
Fuck! Tasting like huevos.

476
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,296
He's going to fuck her.

477
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:22,964
"Now I'm going to hatch my chick."

478
00:15:29,971 --> 00:15:31,348
He kisses real nice, girl.

479
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:32,724
He's very romantic, guys.

480
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:33,642
I think he won't.

481
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,352
Twelve hours kissing that girl...

482
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:36,603
That's not possible, man.

483
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:38,563
João is very soft.

484
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:40,273
Listen, here's the thing.

485
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:41,358
Ouch, you rascal.

486
00:15:41,358 --> 00:15:43,443
I don't want to fuck you anymore.

487
00:15:43,443 --> 00:15:44,611
Oh, my God!

488
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,112
Fuck...

489
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,865
I told you, guys! I told you, guys!

490
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:50,283
I don't want to see.

491
00:15:50,283 --> 00:15:51,868
- I told you.
- Oh, my God.

492
00:15:51,868 --> 00:15:53,203
What did he say to that woman?

493
00:15:53,203 --> 00:15:54,287
"I don't want to fuck you"?

494
00:15:54,287 --> 00:15:56,122
Rewind it, I even broke the mic.

495
00:15:56,122 --> 00:15:58,458
There's no need to rewind it, look at her.

496
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,126
- No...
- Oh, no, João!

497
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,211
Wait, wait, guys.

498
00:16:01,211 --> 00:16:02,754
Sweetheart... She wants it.

499
00:16:02,754 --> 00:16:04,089
Holy shit, hit play.

500
00:16:04,089 --> 00:16:05,173
- Girl...
- Wait.

501
00:16:05,173 --> 00:16:06,883
No, wait, everyone, quiet.

502
00:16:07,842 --> 00:16:12,889
Listen, here's the thing.
I don't want to fuck you anymore.

503
00:16:12,889 --> 00:16:14,432
I want to hang out with you.

504
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,559
He said, "I don't want to fuck you."

505
00:16:16,559 --> 00:16:17,769
Sweetheart?

506
00:16:19,187 --> 00:16:20,438
Go have sex, boy.

507
00:16:20,438 --> 00:16:22,023
Look at the boy there.

508
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,108
Jesus Christ!

509
00:16:23,233 --> 00:16:24,234
Look at those two.

510
00:16:25,777 --> 00:16:28,405
They're idiots, man. I'm talking to you.

511
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:30,156
Hard to believe.

512
00:16:30,156 --> 00:16:31,241
I can't believe it.

513
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:32,325
Guys...

514
00:16:32,325 --> 00:16:34,494
Are they going to have sex?

515
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:35,704
Everyone is laughing at him.

516
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:38,123
Man, João, João is messing up.

517
00:16:38,248 --> 00:16:42,293
When I'm partying hard
and my alcohol levels are above my neck...

518
00:16:42,293 --> 00:16:43,211
If someone said,

519
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:45,672
"Come on, I don't want...
Let's just talk."

520
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:47,924
What would I say? I'd just say no, okay?

521
00:16:47,924 --> 00:16:50,301
I'm not snuggling in bed
with someone when I'm drunk.

522
00:16:50,301 --> 00:16:51,594
Talking? Wake up!

523
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:53,471
She didn't want it,

524
00:16:53,471 --> 00:16:55,974
and he tried to talk her into it,
using some lame excuse.

525
00:16:55,974 --> 00:16:57,016
"I want to chat with you."

526
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,184
He should've been more straightforward.

527
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,519
Don't you think, Carol?

528
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:00,562
- Crazy!
- I think...

529
00:17:00,562 --> 00:17:01,479
I think she wasn't...

530
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:03,940
He's asking to have sex.
He's begging, you know?

531
00:17:04,774 --> 00:17:06,985
- His balls must hurt, right?
- Be cool...

532
00:17:06,985 --> 00:17:10,071
You never thought
you were going to meet me.

533
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,367
I like you a lot, man.

534
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,577
Half for you, half for me.

535
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,621
She's sharing her pizza,
and he wants to eat...

536
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,373
She's got a romantic vibe.

537
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,708
He wants to eat pussy.

538
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:22,876
She shares her pizza...

539
00:17:22,876 --> 00:17:25,128
Do you want to do it or not?

540
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:28,923
Don't be mad, man.
We're enjoying this moment.

541
00:17:28,923 --> 00:17:31,176
I'm not mad. I'm just sad.

542
00:17:31,176 --> 00:17:32,343
Man...

543
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:36,055
He's crying!

544
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:36,973
Fuck!

545
00:17:36,973 --> 00:17:39,184
What a man does when he wants to get laid.

546
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:40,518
He even cries...

547
00:17:40,518 --> 00:17:41,436
Holy shit!

548
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:43,354
Look. "We have so much in common.

549
00:17:43,354 --> 00:17:44,939
We're a couple." That's crazy.

550
00:17:44,939 --> 00:17:46,149
Please, rewind it.

551
00:17:46,149 --> 00:17:47,734
- What the hell...
- Fuck, man.

552
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:48,818
- God...
- Look at João!

553
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,195
Holy shit!

554
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:57,118
Do you want to spend the
night here? Or do you want to leave?

555
00:17:57,243 --> 00:17:59,287
Look, Thais has a long face, too, look.

556
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:01,372
"Do you want to spend the night here?"

557
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:02,290
It's not that.

558
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,250
Man, what's going on with those guys?

559
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,127
Everyone is in love, right? Yeah...

560
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:08,755
She wants to dismiss him...

561
00:18:08,755 --> 00:18:10,298
This is good sense, right?

562
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,926
That dude wants to stay there.

563
00:18:13,176 --> 00:18:15,011
He wants to become a participant.

564
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:16,554
I hate sleeping with someone
I've just fucked.

565
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:19,849
Guys, don't ask me
because I'll tell a different story...

566
00:18:19,849 --> 00:18:21,392
Don't ask me...

567
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,186
Come on, Carol, tell us.

568
00:18:23,186 --> 00:18:24,395
But be brief, Carol.

569
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:26,439
Tell us a short story, come on.

570
00:18:26,439 --> 00:18:28,149
Please. "In 1972, my grandma..."

571
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,776
- Just a little bit, a nugget.
- Go.

572
00:18:30,777 --> 00:18:33,780
I have a song called,
"Propaganda Enganosa."

573
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,408
It goes, "The guy is handsome,
has two daughters..."

574
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:38,326
Holy fuck.

575
00:18:38,326 --> 00:18:40,203
"Send me a picture of your dick."

576
00:18:40,203 --> 00:18:41,788
I thought, "The guy's gotta have a dick."

577
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:44,165
Okay. We started talking.

578
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:47,377
We made a date.

579
00:18:47,377 --> 00:18:48,545
When I realized,

580
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:50,505
I was talking for three hours with him...

581
00:18:50,505 --> 00:18:51,464
Oh, no.

582
00:18:51,464 --> 00:18:54,592
I thought, "Man, won't this guy
invite me to fuck?"

583
00:18:54,592 --> 00:18:56,094
Then I thought...

584
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:59,222
"Hey, buddy, let's go
to the room and do it."

585
00:18:59,222 --> 00:19:00,598
"Buddy." How intimate.

586
00:19:00,598 --> 00:19:01,933
He said, "Let's do it."

587
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:04,853
When we were in the room,
the only thing he did was suck me...

588
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,814
And nothing else.

589
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:11,276
Fuck, man. God, what's going on?

590
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,863
- Praying, you started praying.
- When he started...

591
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:18,408
I swear to God,
he stuck his dick two times,

592
00:19:18,408 --> 00:19:19,492
I got up and said,

593
00:19:19,492 --> 00:19:22,328
"Buddy, I'm not feeling well,
I don't drink..."

594
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:26,124
I went to the bathroom,
started talking to the mirror.

595
00:19:26,666 --> 00:19:29,878
I said, "I'm going to go back there
and kick his ass."

596
00:19:29,878 --> 00:19:32,380
How come he talks to me
without having a dick?

597
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:33,715
Did he have a tiny dick?

598
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:35,842
He had no dick, man! No dick!

599
00:19:35,842 --> 00:19:38,094
- I said, "I'm going to kill him!"
-"Dear Neiva."

600
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:40,013
Then I started walking around
the backyard.

601
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:41,347
It was already morning.

602
00:19:41,347 --> 00:19:43,516
I was very sweaty, horny big time...

603
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:47,478
Then what happened?
I wrote this song, "Propaganda Enganosa."

604
00:19:47,854 --> 00:19:49,063
Do you send nudes?

605
00:19:49,063 --> 00:19:50,064
I send nudes.

606
00:19:50,064 --> 00:19:52,650
I think it's amazing sending nudes.

607
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,527
Do you receive a lot of nudes?

608
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:57,405
Speaking of which,
boys send me nudes that I love.

609
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,535
It's the only English sentence she knows.

610
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:04,579
She memorized that text just because...

611
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:06,164
Let's go back...

612
00:20:06,164 --> 00:20:07,582
For Christ's sake. Look.

613
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:18,092
He kissed the broom. Look.

614
00:20:18,092 --> 00:20:20,470
He'll stick it in his ass. He should.

615
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:22,180
Stop it... Will he masturbate?

616
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,264
What the fuck, man.

617
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:25,558
He's going to masturbate
his ass with the...

618
00:20:25,558 --> 00:20:26,684
Not with the broom, right?

619
00:20:26,684 --> 00:20:28,728
He's going to sleep with the stick.

620
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:30,188
- Call me, João.
- Guys...

621
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:31,981
- João let me down...
- It's embarrassing.

622
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:33,524
Is he a Pisces? He's a Pisces.

623
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:34,484
He's desperate.

624
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:35,485
Do you wanna know his sign?

625
00:20:35,485 --> 00:20:37,070
I don't believe in that tear over there.

626
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:39,489
He's desperate.

627
00:20:39,489 --> 00:20:42,951
- Every emotion is extreme.
- He was trying to get laid, at any cost.

628
00:20:43,409 --> 00:20:44,911
I think he's out of control.

629
00:20:44,911 --> 00:20:47,205
He'll even cry to get laid, man.

630
00:20:47,538 --> 00:20:49,123
He was desperately
trying to get laid.

631
00:20:49,123 --> 00:20:50,124
Tears of horniness.

632
00:20:50,124 --> 00:20:53,127
I think it's a mix of booze
and a desire of getting laid.

633
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,045
I think that's it, guys.

634
00:20:54,045 --> 00:20:57,674
João is wrong
for addressing women as "bro."

635
00:20:57,674 --> 00:21:00,176
I think "chick" and "bro"
is better than "girlfriend".

636
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:02,053
-"Bro" is not that bad.
- No...

637
00:21:02,053 --> 00:21:03,805
Girl, I love when a boy...

638
00:21:03,805 --> 00:21:05,390
Do you know what turns me on?

639
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,393
When a boy comes and says,
"How are you doing, princess?"

640
00:21:08,393 --> 00:21:09,352
What?

641
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:12,480
The boy comes and says,
"Hey, princess, let's go over there."

642
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,731
I love "queen of backcountry."

643
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,066
Do you like "princess"?

644
00:21:15,066 --> 00:21:17,610
Obviously. I get super horny.

645
00:21:17,986 --> 00:21:20,196
I like it when they call me "bandit."

646
00:21:20,196 --> 00:21:23,157
She likes men that cry,
do the right thing,

647
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,034
and call her "bandit."
Where is she going to find them?

648
00:21:25,159 --> 00:21:27,120
Look, let me explain.

649
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,580
My childhood nickname is "bandit."

650
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,416
Where's my wallet?

651
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,584
Then I know guys and they say,
"Hey, MC Carol."

652
00:21:33,584 --> 00:21:36,754
What? It's not MC Carol.

653
00:21:36,754 --> 00:21:38,089
That is my stage name.

654
00:21:38,089 --> 00:21:39,966
Here, it's "bandit."

655
00:21:39,966 --> 00:21:41,300
Take this away.

656
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,385
Bandit.

657
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:49,350
Did you get some sleep?

658
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,309
- No.
- I didn't.

659
00:21:50,309 --> 00:21:51,811
No?

660
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:52,895
I didn't sleep well at all.

661
00:21:52,895 --> 00:21:54,605
Where's your man?

662
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:55,982
He just won't leave.

663
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:58,860
I think he took it seriously when I said
I'd take him in my luggage.

664
00:21:58,860 --> 00:21:59,861
Yes...

665
00:21:59,861 --> 00:22:01,612
- How do you feel?
- I don't know.

666
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:03,364
Have you talked to him?

667
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:04,449
I'll talk to him.

668
00:22:10,204 --> 00:22:11,581
He's going to... He's hot.

669
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:14,208
He's hot, a prince. Very cute.

670
00:22:15,835 --> 00:22:18,212
He loves snuggling.
He turned his head to the side...

671
00:22:18,212 --> 00:22:20,006
Don't you want to get his number?

672
00:22:20,006 --> 00:22:21,507
What are you going to say to him?

673
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:22,633
I don't know.

674
00:22:25,053 --> 00:22:26,804
I'm not good at asking people to leave.

675
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,557
Just say, "Time to say goodbye."

676
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,726
Bye!

677
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:34,395
I'd pay, at least,
for the boy's transportation back home.

678
00:22:34,395 --> 00:22:35,938
- I'd say, "Hey, buddy."
- Yes.

679
00:22:35,938 --> 00:22:38,149
We're going to get dressed and all.

680
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:42,028
Maybe I'll take a shower before I leave.

681
00:22:42,028 --> 00:22:43,362
I think I'm leaving, too.

682
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,573
Do you know where your stuff is?

683
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:47,617
No.

684
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:48,993
- I'll help you.
- I guess I do.

685
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:50,203
I'm going to look for my things.

686
00:22:50,203 --> 00:22:51,287
It's not possible.

687
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,371
She's cute.

688
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,956
He exaggerated. No good sense.

689
00:22:53,956 --> 00:22:55,917
He has no good sense...

690
00:22:55,917 --> 00:22:57,668
It's real quick.
Explain something to me.

691
00:22:57,668 --> 00:23:00,755
When you have sex,
what do you do afterwards?

692
00:23:00,755 --> 00:23:02,173
You go away just like that?

693
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:03,508
That depends a lot. Because...

694
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:04,675
Guys.

695
00:23:04,675 --> 00:23:07,512
I'd rather go to the person's place.
If the place is bad, I bounce.

696
00:23:07,512 --> 00:23:08,971
You don't have to send the person away.

697
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,807
And I bounce when it's over.

698
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:12,308
I hate sleeping with someone
I've just fucked,

699
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:13,392
especially...

700
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:15,645
Don't ask me
because I'll tell another story...

701
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:16,729
Carol would be sleeping.

702
00:23:16,729 --> 00:23:18,689
I'll tell you one move of mine...

703
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,108
Carol would be already sleeping.

704
00:23:20,108 --> 00:23:22,068
Yeah... Bianca, for example.

705
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,945
I say to Bianca, "Girl, watch out."

706
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:28,366
Then Bianca calls me and say,
"Girl, I need you now. Get over here now."

707
00:23:28,491 --> 00:23:29,325
Right.

708
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:32,662
"Hey, baby, unfortunately,
I'll have to leave."

709
00:23:32,787 --> 00:23:34,413
There's always a way out.

710
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:37,250
Or you say
you have an appointment after the sex.

711
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,293
I don't have to say it.
There's going to be...

712
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:41,504
I'd rather go to the person's place...

713
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:42,421
There's going to be.

714
00:23:42,421 --> 00:23:44,048
I'm saving on transportation.

715
00:23:44,048 --> 00:23:45,633
- Are you pointing at me?
-"The person's..."

716
00:23:45,633 --> 00:23:46,592
Street, avenue...

717
00:23:46,592 --> 00:23:48,302
She looked said, "Person's place."

718
00:23:48,302 --> 00:23:49,679
I'd rather go to the person's place.

719
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:50,930
If it's bad, I bounce.

720
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:53,891
Yeah, it's better
than dismissing the person.

721
00:23:53,891 --> 00:23:55,309
This avoids the embarrassment.

722
00:23:55,309 --> 00:23:56,310
Come on!

723
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:58,855
Let's go! Yay! Fuck, let's go!

724
00:23:58,855 --> 00:24:03,025
Hey! Let's go, let's go, let's go!

725
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:04,193
All good.

726
00:24:04,193 --> 00:24:05,444
We have arrived.

727
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:06,988
Whoa! Skate park.

728
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:08,072
Look at that.

729
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:14,078
I'm a little jealous.

730
00:24:14,912 --> 00:24:16,789
Are you jealous?

731
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:19,834
I wanted to be like you, but I can't.

732
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:21,627
Shameless. Funny.

733
00:24:21,627 --> 00:24:23,921
- Look!
- Funny thing is... Look.

734
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,548
Did I give you any reason to be jealous?

735
00:24:26,132 --> 00:24:27,466
No, and even if you did...

736
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:30,469
You're not jealous? I'm a little jealous.

737
00:24:30,469 --> 00:24:32,221
Not if I trust the guy.

738
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:33,306
Hey, bro. I...

739
00:24:33,306 --> 00:24:35,766
If there's one thing that
drives me crazy, it's jealousy.

740
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:37,393
They started fighting again.

741
00:24:37,393 --> 00:24:39,145
They're going to be the couple...

742
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:41,022
There's always a bad atmosphere.

743
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:43,983
...do you expect me to be Zen about it?

744
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:45,526
You'll never see that.

745
00:24:45,526 --> 00:24:46,944
That's fine.

746
00:24:47,069 --> 00:24:50,364
When a woman says something like that,
hit the pause.

747
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:55,036
Things will get ugly.
She's starting to get jealous.

748
00:24:55,036 --> 00:24:57,997
It's the same if a woman comes
into a room, you are talking...

749
00:24:57,997 --> 00:24:59,916
You're watching TV and she says,

750
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:02,418
"Let me tell you something,
I'm not going to fuck you."

751
00:25:02,418 --> 00:25:04,712
You didn't even mention sex
and she said, "I won't fuck you."

752
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:06,672
You go ahead and do it...

753
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:08,674
I'll be honest with you.

754
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:11,093
I like you, but...

755
00:25:11,093 --> 00:25:12,428
- That's the point.
- I know.

756
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:14,931
But, brother, I'm totally free.
I'm totally free.

757
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:15,890
When the time comes...

758
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:17,975
And you've always
made it very clear to her.

759
00:25:17,975 --> 00:25:19,727
I'm going to sit down with her...

760
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,187
I'm going to say, "Here's the thing..."

761
00:25:21,187 --> 00:25:22,939
Or you... No, no.

762
00:25:23,522 --> 00:25:25,775
Brother, it's not going to happen anymore.

763
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:28,152
It's your decision to make.

764
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:31,280
I don't want the girl
to have any more expectations.

765
00:25:33,241 --> 00:25:34,242
I want to roll with you.

766
00:25:34,242 --> 00:25:37,245
João is so emotional.
João is a... Holy shit, man.

767
00:25:37,245 --> 00:25:39,372
João became a good friend. The buddy...

768
00:25:39,372 --> 00:25:40,331
Yeah...

769
00:25:40,331 --> 00:25:42,416
If he sits down with her
and says, "Look..."

770
00:25:42,416 --> 00:25:43,334
He was honest.

771
00:25:43,334 --> 00:25:46,003
I think it's better
than messing things up...

772
00:25:46,003 --> 00:25:46,963
Yes.

773
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:49,674
It's straight talk,
but she's upset, look.

774
00:25:49,674 --> 00:25:51,509
Look at that person's face,
who likes to be unattached.

775
00:25:51,509 --> 00:25:52,718
She's very upset.

776
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,637
Man, she's hunting him.

777
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:58,182
- She's looking for trouble.
- Yes, exactly.

778
00:25:58,182 --> 00:26:00,518
No, it wasn't like that.

779
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:01,978
He stalled a little to tell her that.

780
00:26:01,978 --> 00:26:03,354
Yes, he kind of stalled.

781
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:04,272
He didn't stall.

782
00:26:04,272 --> 00:26:05,690
He doesn't want that anymore, man.

783
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,234
He had to say it from the beginning.

784
00:26:08,234 --> 00:26:09,318
There are some people...

785
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:10,361
Yeah, I'd be upset.

786
00:26:10,361 --> 00:26:13,489
They're in a house.
Above all, you have to talk.

787
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:14,573
Are you all right?

788
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,909
I just have to pee, that's all.

789
00:26:17,285 --> 00:26:18,244
- Come on.
- What's up?

790
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:21,205
- I heard João saying some stuff to Murilo.
- Seriously?

791
00:26:21,205 --> 00:26:23,708
João said,
"You're going to be a player again, right?

792
00:26:23,708 --> 00:26:26,544
Back to the game." And then he...

793
00:26:26,544 --> 00:26:28,337
- João? João?
- Jo... Girl...

794
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:29,422
João?

795
00:26:34,969 --> 00:26:37,930
Come on, girlfriend.
One, two, three and... Whoa!

796
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:41,851
Who can chug it faster? Go, go, go!

797
00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:42,893
Taynara went to the party.

798
00:26:42,893 --> 00:26:44,603
Look at João's face...

799
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,731
She's right. Go, Taynara!

800
00:26:47,315 --> 00:26:48,691
Check out the drama.

801
00:26:48,691 --> 00:26:49,775
Check out the music.

802
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,569
He's drinking, right, huh, fellow.

803
00:26:51,569 --> 00:26:52,862
Paola Bracho.

804
00:26:52,862 --> 00:26:54,989
Do you want drama? Slow-motion scene.

805
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,699
It's drama.

806
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:58,534
Brazilian version, Herbert Richers.

807
00:26:58,534 --> 00:27:00,619
They're really drinking.

808
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:02,413
Ouch.

809
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:04,498
You're done, Taynara.

810
00:27:04,498 --> 00:27:05,708
Don't play his game.

811
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:08,210
It's hard to resist, I know,
but don't do it.

812
00:27:08,836 --> 00:27:10,171
Don't do it...

813
00:27:10,463 --> 00:27:13,049
Look at John eating all the food.

814
00:27:13,049 --> 00:27:15,176
- The food ended up on his lap.
- Yes, man.

815
00:27:15,176 --> 00:27:17,094
He put the plate on his lap.

816
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,849
I'm still in control.

817
00:27:22,224 --> 00:27:25,144
I need a shower. I feel like I stink.

818
00:27:29,482 --> 00:27:31,025
He's bathing her wearing clothes.

819
00:27:31,025 --> 00:27:32,109
Wait...

820
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:33,694
Hey...

821
00:27:33,694 --> 00:27:35,196
Get out of there, João!

822
00:27:35,196 --> 00:27:37,490
João, get out of there!

823
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,325
Emotional João...

824
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:41,035
Every time you have a chat...

825
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:43,412
- Every time you have a chat...
- Please.

826
00:27:43,412 --> 00:27:45,664
- I end up getting hurt.
- Stop talking. Easy.

827
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,000
- Man, have I ever...
- What? Easy, my ass!

828
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,543
Easy, my ass! I'm furious!

829
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:55,466
Murilo, you need to be more sensitive
to my feelings.

830
00:27:55,466 --> 00:27:57,176
And I'm not? I'm not?

831
00:27:57,176 --> 00:27:58,427
Do you think I'm doing you wrong?

832
00:27:58,427 --> 00:27:59,637
I really came here to fight...

833
00:27:59,637 --> 00:28:01,430
Saline. Make her drink this.

834
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:02,681
Saline, guys.

835
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,726
Saline. He got seawater to give her.

836
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:08,687
Fuck, take this water from Praia Grande.

837
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:09,814
How cute. Saline.

838
00:28:09,814 --> 00:28:11,649
Guys, there's always someone...

839
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:12,691
It's that famous...

840
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,902
It's like you're fighting.

841
00:28:15,361 --> 00:28:18,364
In the middle of the situation.
Holy shit, right?

842
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:19,824
...will talk to you in the bedroom.

843
00:28:19,824 --> 00:28:21,534
No, I want you out of here.

844
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:22,910
I'll get out.

845
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,620
I'm taking you to the bedroom safely.

846
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:25,955
...it's dangerous in the bathroom.

847
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,415
Really.

848
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:28,374
"I want to take a longer shower!"

849
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:30,292
I've never seen anyone
crying to take a shower.

850
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:31,377
Man, she's wasted.

851
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:33,003
They suffer for everything...

852
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:34,463
"I want to take a longer shower!"

853
00:28:34,463 --> 00:28:35,798
I want you out of here.

854
00:28:35,798 --> 00:28:37,341
I'll get out of here...

855
00:28:37,341 --> 00:28:38,968
That's the best, girl.

856
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:41,053
Hey, stay here. Come here.

857
00:28:41,053 --> 00:28:43,597
Stay with her in the bathroom.
I'm done with it.

858
00:28:44,974 --> 00:28:46,183
What did he say?

859
00:28:46,183 --> 00:28:47,268
He's done with it.

860
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:49,311
Girl, stop saying this shit.

861
00:28:50,104 --> 00:28:52,648
What happened? What's going on, girl?

862
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:54,900
What happened is that Murilo makes me cry.

863
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,819
I think I'd react differently.

864
00:28:56,819 --> 00:29:00,114
"Go crazy with me."

865
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:01,991
She put on a little show,
"We're doing it today."

866
00:29:01,991 --> 00:29:03,492
Then she got hammered.

867
00:29:03,492 --> 00:29:07,079
She's like me. Look at that pot...
She's eating. That's the best.

868
00:29:09,498 --> 00:29:10,875
Let me ask you something.

869
00:29:10,875 --> 00:29:12,168
When you overheard...

870
00:29:12,168 --> 00:29:14,128
- Careful there.
- Sit down. Over there.

871
00:29:14,128 --> 00:29:17,214
My only problem
is that he told me he liked me

872
00:29:17,214 --> 00:29:19,091
and then he said he didn't feel anything,

873
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:21,010
that my heart doesn't belong to him.

874
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:21,927
But did he say that?

875
00:29:21,927 --> 00:29:24,263
He did. To my face, in front of Blondie.

876
00:29:25,431 --> 00:29:27,057
A flower is always nice.

877
00:29:27,057 --> 00:29:29,894
The boy gave a flower,
but he gave his heart.

878
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:30,895
No, no, no...

879
00:29:30,895 --> 00:29:33,105
- But she's got your heart.
- No, she hasn't.

880
00:29:33,105 --> 00:29:35,941
If he doesn't acknowledge my feelings,
shut up.

881
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,401
- That's all I ask.
- Careful there.

882
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:38,569
I'm not a child.

883
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:42,990
Yes, she's consistent.

884
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,700
Sit and tell me exactly like it is.

885
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:47,203
Even if I was very drunk, I'd never...

886
00:29:47,203 --> 00:29:49,079
That bunk bed is in pain, huh.

887
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:50,206
That bunk bed is in pain!

888
00:29:50,206 --> 00:29:51,290
I've never gone up on a bunk bed...

889
00:29:51,749 --> 00:29:53,083
"Relax. Just relax.

890
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:54,710
If I said I'm with you,

891
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:58,714
if I ever screw up,
you'll be the first to know."

892
00:29:58,714 --> 00:30:00,758
And if he's honest and you don't like it?

893
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:03,219
But he said it.

894
00:30:03,344 --> 00:30:05,346
What's the truth?
That he's a player?

895
00:30:05,346 --> 00:30:06,472
He was always upfront with you.

896
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:07,806
Then you fucking hurt me.

897
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:11,894
Look me in the eye. Look me
in the eye and say, "I'm a player.

898
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:13,812
What we have in the house is one thing.

899
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:14,939
Out here, it's a different story."

900
00:30:14,939 --> 00:30:16,982
- Enough, João.
- The house is the house.

901
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,859
I just need honesty. I was upset today...

902
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:19,902
He's being upfront with you.

903
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:21,820
I was very upset today because...

904
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,031
Girl, I didn't even know
what was going on.

905
00:30:24,031 --> 00:30:25,950
You were assuming things, then.

906
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,452
No! She said,
"But aren't you falling for her?"

907
00:30:28,452 --> 00:30:31,080
And he said,
"No. Not falling for her at all."

908
00:30:31,539 --> 00:30:34,625
Then, in the afternoon,
Thais says he's falling for me and shit.

909
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,585
He says, "Not even close."

910
00:30:36,585 --> 00:30:38,045
Everyone is drunk, that's funny.

911
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:40,130
It's drunk talk, man.

912
00:30:40,130 --> 00:30:43,050
I'm loving it.
Just like me, wasted in the clubs.

913
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:46,428
She's upset because he said he liked her,
then he said he didn't...

914
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:47,721
I'm like this when I buy gin...

915
00:30:47,721 --> 00:30:49,306
She's taking it out on João.

916
00:30:50,641 --> 00:30:52,643
When I buy gin and there's no tonic,
I get like this.

917
00:30:52,643 --> 00:30:53,769
She's taking it out on João.

918
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:55,145
What does João...

919
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:56,230
She doesn't want...

920
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:57,314
João is going...

921
00:30:57,898 --> 00:31:00,025
He's going to cry. Don't do this to him.

922
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:02,403
- Look, she's pissed at João.
- Fuck!

923
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:03,320
People's energy...

924
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:04,238
So don't tell me...

925
00:31:04,238 --> 00:31:06,699
Fuck! She's taking it out on João, man.

926
00:31:06,699 --> 00:31:07,783
Oh, my God.

927
00:31:07,783 --> 00:31:09,326
It's not a lie.

928
00:31:09,326 --> 00:31:11,453
- That got me very upset.
- The thing is...

929
00:31:11,453 --> 00:31:13,956
I hate people who talk and touch me.

930
00:31:13,956 --> 00:31:16,000
Are you zooming in?
Take your hands off me!

931
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:16,959
...to hook up with several people.

932
00:31:16,959 --> 00:31:18,460
Look what you're doing with me.

933
00:31:20,588 --> 00:31:22,256
"Stop it, I'm going to cry!"

934
00:31:22,256 --> 00:31:24,133
Out of the blue.

935
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,260
That's why I was mad. He told me...

936
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:28,304
Screw it. Look, I'm your brother, man.

937
00:31:28,304 --> 00:31:29,471
Don't fucking shove me.

938
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:30,514
Brother, brother.

939
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:31,432
What's going on?

940
00:31:31,432 --> 00:31:32,349
Girl!

941
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:34,768
They are in Narnia, right?

942
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:36,520
Her! Her!

943
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,605
Don't just say shit.

944
00:31:37,605 --> 00:31:39,690
Don't just say stuff you don't mean...

945
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:41,483
Easy. Shit, take it easy!

946
00:31:41,483 --> 00:31:45,154
He didn't mean that.

947
00:31:45,154 --> 00:31:46,947
That's all I asked.

948
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:49,491
Both points of view.

949
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:52,328
What happened?
I didn't see, I was in the bathroom.

950
00:31:52,328 --> 00:31:53,871
I don't even know, bro.

951
00:31:53,871 --> 00:31:55,372
It was completely senseless.

952
00:31:55,372 --> 00:31:59,793
He didn't hook up with another woman.
He didn't do anything.

953
00:32:00,085 --> 00:32:01,295
He was sincere.

954
00:32:01,754 --> 00:32:04,882
He said, "I'm not as involved as you are."

955
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:07,009
But he told it to João.

956
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:09,803
The other girl went there
and played broken telephone.

957
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:11,305
- You get it?
- Chinese whispers?

958
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:13,849
Oh, yeah, Chinese whispers,
that's when they talk.

959
00:32:13,849 --> 00:32:15,392
If it's broken, you can't hear it.

960
00:32:15,392 --> 00:32:16,727
- It could be.
- Makes sense.

961
00:32:16,727 --> 00:32:19,897
If it's broken, you can't hear it.
It's got to be Chinese whispers.

962
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:21,732
Have you ever been dumped like this?

963
00:32:21,732 --> 00:32:23,108
That guy didn't say a thing

964
00:32:23,108 --> 00:32:27,196
and started messing up
while they were drinking.

965
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:29,073
What if he hooks up with...

966
00:32:29,073 --> 00:32:32,409
He didn't hook up with anyone.
He didn't do anything wrong.

967
00:32:32,409 --> 00:32:33,452
He wakes up...

968
00:32:33,452 --> 00:32:34,703
"I'm going to keep seeing her."

969
00:32:34,703 --> 00:32:36,246
- Then what?
- Hold on.

970
00:32:36,372 --> 00:32:38,082
It's not about,
"It's not going to happen."

971
00:32:38,082 --> 00:32:38,999
That's obvious.

972
00:32:38,999 --> 00:32:43,962
He was avoiding it for a very long time,
two days, actually.

973
00:32:44,088 --> 00:32:46,048
He was playing her from the beginning

974
00:32:46,048 --> 00:32:47,591
and now he says,
"I don't want it anymore."

975
00:32:47,591 --> 00:32:48,926
How do you mean, playing?

976
00:32:48,926 --> 00:32:51,095
He was kind of... Kind of undecided.

977
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:54,390
- They were having a good relationship.
- Right!

978
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:56,767
They were getting along pretty well.

979
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:58,977
That guy came in the house and said,

980
00:32:58,977 --> 00:32:59,978
"Bro, I won't date."

981
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:01,355
Did you hear what he said?

982
00:33:01,355 --> 00:33:02,690
"Are you going to be my woman?"

983
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:04,733
"So, let's have fun
while we'fre we're here."

984
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:06,694
She liked him more than he liked her.

985
00:33:06,694 --> 00:33:07,695
And she got hurt.

986
00:33:07,695 --> 00:33:09,029
He realized that,
if he got involved with her,

987
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:12,157
he'd have to stay only with her...

988
00:33:12,157 --> 00:33:14,326
Here's the thing, we're here talking

989
00:33:14,451 --> 00:33:16,829
because I'm sure, on the next episode...

990
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:18,247
...Murilo is going to hit on that girl.

991
00:33:18,247 --> 00:33:20,124
He's going to kiss her again...

992
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:22,209
And everything's all right.

993
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:24,628
ON THE NEXT EPISODE

994
00:33:24,628 --> 00:33:26,213
So, it was all for nothing?

995
00:33:26,213 --> 00:33:28,757
I'm not... Do you think I'm a fool?

996
00:33:28,924 --> 00:33:30,300
For me, kissing...

997
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,553
For me, kissing has a lot of feelings.

998
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:34,096
What about fucking? No?

999
00:33:35,097 --> 00:33:37,975
- I see!
- That's fucked up.

1000
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,852
Guys, I had sex, look.

1001
00:33:39,852 --> 00:33:41,562
No!

1002
00:33:41,562 --> 00:33:42,646
- That's a lie!
- João!
