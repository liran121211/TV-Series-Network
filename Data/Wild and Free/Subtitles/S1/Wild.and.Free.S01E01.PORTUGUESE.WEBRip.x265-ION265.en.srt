1
00:00:15,558 --> 00:00:17,768
- We're here.
- Hello?

2
00:00:17,768 --> 00:00:19,979
I hope we see a lot of hot sex scenes.

3
00:00:19,979 --> 00:00:21,397
Excuse me.

4
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:23,149
You're totally being Blanca.

5
00:00:24,150 --> 00:00:25,776
Blanca Evangelista.

6
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:28,529
Guys, we've been invited
by Amazon Prime Video

7
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:32,283
to watch the first episode
of Wild and Free: Florianópolis.

8
00:00:32,575 --> 00:00:35,035
Basically, eight friends go to Floripa

9
00:00:35,035 --> 00:00:38,581
to spend their vacations in a dream house
and enjoy the best parties.

10
00:00:38,956 --> 00:00:40,207
Who has already been to Floripa?

11
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:43,377
My gosh, that's everybody.

12
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:46,672
"Who's been to Floripa?"
is not the right question.

13
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:48,215
It's "Who got lucky in Floripa?"

14
00:00:48,215 --> 00:00:50,593
I can't think of anybody not getting lucky there.

15
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:51,677
That's true.

16
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:56,182
I'll rephrase my question.
Who's had a hot date in Floripa?

17
00:00:56,182 --> 00:00:57,141
No.

18
00:00:57,266 --> 00:00:59,310
Who has hooked up with anyone in Floripa?

19
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,895
Who's been happy in Floripa?

20
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,356
I have to go to Floripa.
Let's go to Floripa?

21
00:01:05,316 --> 00:01:06,984
Amazon will pay for our tickets.

22
00:01:08,569 --> 00:01:09,904
Amazon...

23
00:01:11,489 --> 00:01:13,532
Anyway, I have been to Floripa
in the summer.

24
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:16,035
And when I went there,
it all felt very...

25
00:01:16,035 --> 00:01:18,496
Everyone's free, you know, no rules...

26
00:01:18,496 --> 00:01:21,916
...everybody is enjoying themselves,
no worries, no stress.

27
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:24,710
When I went there, I was ugly,
and people there are pretty.

28
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:26,128
Where do they come from?

29
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:28,172
Yes, they are. It's true.

30
00:01:28,172 --> 00:01:29,882
Their fathers have paint brushes,

31
00:01:29,882 --> 00:01:32,760
not dicks, honest to God.

32
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,094
Women are like paintings!

33
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,514
Pretend my mouth is a canvas, go ahead.

34
00:01:36,514 --> 00:01:38,098
I'm scared to see...

35
00:01:38,516 --> 00:01:40,267
My mouth is a canvas, do your thing.

36
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:43,229
Go ahead, Picasso. I'm ready.

37
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:48,400
Guys, all we know is they're not actors
and there's no script, it's all for real.

38
00:01:48,526 --> 00:01:50,069
We'll have to watch to know more.

39
00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:52,071
- Get it started.
- Let's go ahead.

40
00:01:52,071 --> 00:01:53,989
It's on. Shush.

41
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:55,157
Get the popcorn, Titto.

42
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:27,773
WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS

43
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:43,432
Shit, look at this house, bro!

44
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:50,731
Awesome, bro!

45
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:54,109
It's gonna be crazy, brother!

46
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:00,699
Oh, my God!

47
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:03,035
Yeah, bro. Welcome! Fuck!

48
00:04:07,289 --> 00:04:08,749
Fuck! Wow!

49
00:04:10,417 --> 00:04:13,212
Man, I knew you were coming too, boy!

50
00:04:15,381 --> 00:04:17,591
Guys, let's get noisy!

51
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,929
Fuck, this is crazy!
I can't believe it, man.

52
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,055
What's up, bro?

53
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:33,816
Guys, look at the moon.

54
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,067
Tonight's gonna be wild!

55
00:04:35,734 --> 00:04:36,860
Check this out, bro.

56
00:04:38,362 --> 00:04:39,822
Gorgeous!

57
00:04:40,948 --> 00:04:42,366
Hello?

58
00:04:42,491 --> 00:04:44,201
Hey!

59
00:04:45,828 --> 00:04:47,371
Oh, yeah!

60
00:04:47,371 --> 00:04:48,789
Hi! Thank God you came.

61
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,378
We're lucky, man. Amazing, man.

62
00:04:55,421 --> 00:04:56,964
We're freaking lucky.

63
00:04:56,964 --> 00:05:00,217
Everything is great! Hi!

64
00:05:00,884 --> 00:05:03,137
- Of course it is!
- I'm fine, and you?

65
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:04,680
You're the first ones here?

66
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:08,350
Check it out. Check out the house.

67
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:17,276
Is everybody all right?

68
00:05:17,276 --> 00:05:18,736
We're all good, and you guys?

69
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:20,195
- Great, man.
- Even better now.

70
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:22,156
Better now, for sure.

71
00:05:22,156 --> 00:05:24,491
Damn, man, so cool, bro! Insane!

72
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,368
It's awesome. Look, many shots.

73
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:31,999
Is this the crazy place
where we're going to be?

74
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:35,002
Welcome, my darlings. Long Live Life, see?

75
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:37,087
We're the best!

76
00:05:39,673 --> 00:05:42,009
Someone's coming!

77
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,427
Hello.

78
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:45,679
I need a man
to help with the luggage.

79
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:48,974
Yo! You can leave it there, I'll get it.

80
00:05:49,641 --> 00:05:51,518
- Hi! So, how are you doing?
- Hello!

81
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,188
This is insane, man!

82
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:56,440
So many beautiful women, look!

83
00:05:57,232 --> 00:06:00,360
Look who's here! Look who's here!

84
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,196
The most beautiful and gorgeous girls.

85
00:06:02,446 --> 00:06:04,490
Everything all right? I can't believe it!

86
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:08,619
She's hitting me.

87
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:11,997
Already hitting me, what the fuck?

88
00:06:12,581 --> 00:06:13,791
You good? It's been so long!

89
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,293
- Yeah, this is so cool.
- Say it, girl.

90
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:18,295
Hi, guys!

91
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:21,965
For heaven's sake,
I can't take this right now.

92
00:06:21,965 --> 00:06:23,008
What the hell?

93
00:06:23,008 --> 00:06:24,843
You all know the house,
it's my turn now.

94
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,470
So, this is the small area...

95
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:27,638
Check this out!

96
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:28,931
The small area, right?

97
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:32,851
- This is gonna be wild.
- Yes.

98
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:33,936
Thank God!

99
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:35,062
Let's go party tonight?

100
00:06:37,439 --> 00:06:38,482
Wow!

101
00:06:38,649 --> 00:06:40,442
I wanna go dance.

102
00:06:41,527 --> 00:06:42,444
Look!

103
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:52,746
Look at his face!

104
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,668
Are you kidding me, Blondie?

105
00:06:57,668 --> 00:06:59,461
When you come talk to me,
I'll tease you.

106
00:06:59,461 --> 00:07:01,380
Like, "What's up, Blondie?"

107
00:07:01,547 --> 00:07:04,258
We're the best.

108
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:10,139
Boy, what a gang!

109
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:11,723
A hell of a gang!

110
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:14,935
I remember seeing you earlier.
That girl went crazy.

111
00:07:15,477 --> 00:07:17,312
I was worried. Like, already? Jeez!

112
00:07:22,901 --> 00:07:25,445
Guys, I got something to say.
Only the best, huh?

113
00:07:25,445 --> 00:07:27,114
You're such a Don Juan!

114
00:07:27,614 --> 00:07:30,784
We have a couple in the house.

115
00:07:31,243 --> 00:07:32,494
The first couple!

116
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:45,048
Fuck! Floripa's family!

117
00:07:45,966 --> 00:07:47,509
It's all good, my man.

118
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:50,345
Hey, brother!

119
00:07:50,345 --> 00:07:51,597
Damn!

120
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:55,184
Hi! How are you?

121
00:07:55,851 --> 00:07:58,020
That's the last one of the girls.

122
00:07:59,104 --> 00:08:00,355
You're looking good.

123
00:08:00,772 --> 00:08:02,191
Damn, you're looking good!

124
00:08:02,774 --> 00:08:04,318
Guys. Let's sit over there.

125
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,527
Great to see you, kid!

126
00:08:05,527 --> 00:08:07,321
Does this camera work?

127
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:09,198
Let's take a selfie.

128
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:19,625
Look at that nose, man,

129
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,834
that's a big nose.

130
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:22,002
The size of that nose!

131
00:08:22,336 --> 00:08:25,005
It's like a 40-inch TV screen
on my face.

132
00:08:25,005 --> 00:08:26,423
Our first picture, yay!

133
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:27,966
Put it on the board.

134
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,676
- Where's the board?
- Is it that one?

135
00:08:36,183 --> 00:08:38,977
Boy! Now it's for real. We're all here!

136
00:08:41,355 --> 00:08:42,814
Blondie! Open your mouth.

137
00:08:47,653 --> 00:08:49,863
First, I'll go around kissing everybody.

138
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:50,989
Little kisses. Okay?

139
00:08:50,989 --> 00:08:52,616
It's one guy, one girl.

140
00:08:53,533 --> 00:08:54,910
Little kisses.

141
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:56,161
Let's go to a club tonight?

142
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,455
I have good news...

143
00:08:58,455 --> 00:08:59,456
Good?

144
00:08:59,456 --> 00:09:00,999
...and I have excellent news.

145
00:09:00,999 --> 00:09:03,210
Booze is excellent.

146
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:05,796
I got us a VIP box at the Green Valley.

147
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:09,049
Let's have a warm-up party?

148
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,637
Here we go!

149
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:22,479
Somebody's hot, right?

150
00:09:25,107 --> 00:09:26,900
I think you should show us
your body.

151
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,901
I think so too.

152
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:28,902
Catwalk!

153
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:29,987
- Can't you see?
- No.

154
00:09:29,987 --> 00:09:31,154
- You should...
- Stand up...

155
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:32,531
I'd take it all off, but I'm fat.

156
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:34,324
Stand up!

157
00:09:35,033 --> 00:09:35,993
No, look.

158
00:09:35,993 --> 00:09:37,411
Turn around.

159
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,038
Hold on, let's get a better picture.

160
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:42,749
- He turned around.
- That's exactly what I want.

161
00:09:42,749 --> 00:09:44,293
Exactly what I want!

162
00:09:45,252 --> 00:09:46,712
I haven't hooked up
with him yet, so...

163
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:48,213
But you can kiss now.

164
00:09:48,463 --> 00:09:50,299
It's never too late to change that.

165
00:09:50,299 --> 00:09:51,383
Truth or dare?

166
00:09:51,383 --> 00:09:55,012
It's time for the first
little smooch to get it started.

167
00:09:55,012 --> 00:09:57,973
First little kiss in the house.

168
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:01,268
It's red lipstick!

169
00:10:02,728 --> 00:10:05,147
Shit, man. It shouldn't be
a movie kiss, ok?

170
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:06,606
We should do the same.

171
00:10:09,401 --> 00:10:10,736
That's crazy.

172
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:12,487
Stop, we were just kidding.

173
00:10:12,487 --> 00:10:13,530
Murilo!

174
00:10:13,530 --> 00:10:14,614
Crap, little smooch?

175
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:17,993
That lipstick is not waterproof.

176
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,578
- No, it's not.
- Look at him!

177
00:10:19,995 --> 00:10:21,413
Someone, help me!

178
00:10:22,122 --> 00:10:23,957
I'm going to kiss someone too.
Who wants one?

179
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:27,085
My God!

180
00:10:27,085 --> 00:10:28,837
Come to the ladies room, girl.

181
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,380
Let's go freshen up.

182
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,882
I'm going to wipe it off.

183
00:10:31,882 --> 00:10:34,343
Yes, exactly. Wipe it off.

184
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,053
Such a nice kiss!

185
00:10:36,803 --> 00:10:37,888
Wait, there'll be more.

186
00:10:39,848 --> 00:10:40,932
It's still early.

187
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,642
- Let's go get dressed up?
- Okay.

188
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,643
We'll be right back.

189
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:45,729
- Brother...
- No.

190
00:10:46,396 --> 00:10:47,439
There...

191
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:52,694
Yes, it's on the four lower teeth.
Here, on the tip of your teeth.

192
00:10:54,112 --> 00:10:55,280
Still there.

193
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:58,325
- Man, I'm so naughty.
- And he's very handsome, too.

194
00:10:58,325 --> 00:10:59,493
I couldn't help it.

195
00:10:59,993 --> 00:11:01,370
Fuck, man.

196
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:03,663
She's beautiful, right?

197
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,582
Yes. As well as the other ones.

198
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:07,751
I can't resist red lipstick.

199
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:08,919
It's too good.

200
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,045
She stands out. Hot brunette.

201
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,506
I couldn't help it.
I was just waiting for that moment.

202
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:15,258
She threw the ball and you had to score.

203
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,969
Crazy, man. Well done.

204
00:11:18,804 --> 00:11:20,305
You know it's going to be insane.

205
00:11:20,305 --> 00:11:21,973
Yeah, it'll be awesome.

206
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:24,684
And I don't want a boyfriend, no way.

207
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,727
Me neither.

208
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:28,230
You know why? I'm not going to lie.

209
00:11:28,814 --> 00:11:31,274
I'm like,
"I don't like to get too attached."

210
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,776
But I'm not like that. I get jealous.

211
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:36,655
So am I. So, like,
if I hook up with someone in the house,

212
00:11:36,863 --> 00:11:39,616
I'm going to get super jealous
if I hook up.

213
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:41,535
That's why I think I screwed up.

214
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:49,835
Hey, Luan. Did you bring this?

215
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,711
- I did.
- And how does it work?

216
00:11:51,878 --> 00:11:53,755
One person pours and the other one...

217
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:56,425
- Awesome.
- Cool!

218
00:11:56,425 --> 00:11:59,511
Really, just straight vodka?
No, add an energy drink.

219
00:11:59,511 --> 00:12:01,138
Let's do it. Put it in your mouth.

220
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:04,307
- Let's break it in...
- I can't see what I'm doing.

221
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,101
Go.

222
00:12:06,101 --> 00:12:08,895
That's going to be a big hit,
my beautiful flamingo!

223
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,480
That's exactly what I want!

224
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:16,528
Don't you know me?

225
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:20,031
You're so bad, you pervert.

226
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,074
I'm bad?

227
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,452
Holy crap, her jacket!

228
00:12:24,202 --> 00:12:26,037
- Pour it. Put it all in.
- Everything?

229
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:28,165
I got a surprise for you guys.

230
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:31,543
Just stay here, real quick.
Give me one sec.

231
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:33,795
Come on, bus!

232
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:56,962
NATH AND RAMON

233
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:06,888
THAIS AND JOAO

234
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:47,554
- Let's stay here.
- You're single, right?

235
00:14:49,431 --> 00:14:52,851
If you don't want to go over there,
we can have fun right here.

236
00:14:53,184 --> 00:14:54,227
I can't believe this.

237
00:14:57,314 --> 00:14:58,732
This is the gang!

238
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:33,892
If you wanna leave with me,
that's okay too.

239
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,031
She was pretty.

240
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:25,026
Write down my name or something.

241
00:16:25,610 --> 00:16:26,778
Can I have your number?

242
00:16:47,716 --> 00:16:48,800
Go hook up with her.

243
00:16:50,218 --> 00:16:53,138
Tell Joyce to go away!

244
00:16:53,346 --> 00:16:54,889
- I already did.
- Blondie is here.

245
00:16:54,889 --> 00:16:56,808
- I want Blondie!
- I don't give a fuck.

246
00:17:12,657 --> 00:17:14,451
Do you think I screwed up?

247
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:18,538
Because that girl...
She was hot, you know?

248
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:19,706
Of course she was,

249
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,207
but you should hook up with Thais.

250
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,668
Thais is better.

251
00:17:26,796 --> 00:17:28,173
Then I kissed João.

252
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:31,176
He then kissed another girl
and then wanted to kiss me again.

253
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:33,303
I didn't want to kiss him again.

254
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:35,972
- I don't know why I'm crying,
- Don't cry.

255
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:37,682
I think it's because I'm drunk.

256
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:41,436
I'm crying because I'm drunk.
I don't care about him.

257
00:17:41,436 --> 00:17:42,479
Okay, stop crying.

258
00:17:42,479 --> 00:17:45,273
I don't care about him. He's full of crap.

259
00:17:54,783 --> 00:17:56,493
Why did you do that to me?

260
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,414
It took you hours to kiss me!

261
00:18:01,748 --> 00:18:02,791
You are full of crap.

262
00:18:09,214 --> 00:18:13,218
I kissed the girl I took to the VIP box.

263
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,094
And she got pissed at me.

264
00:18:15,094 --> 00:18:17,138
She saw me kissing someone else,

265
00:18:17,388 --> 00:18:20,475
then she came back and kissed me.

266
00:18:20,683 --> 00:18:23,978
I was kissing one after the other.

267
00:18:24,354 --> 00:18:25,939
Daddy is great with the ladies!

268
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:45,667
He's a jackass.

269
00:18:56,636 --> 00:19:00,014
Afterparty at the house!

270
00:19:00,473 --> 00:19:01,724
That's great!

271
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:05,103
Gosh, that was a crazy party!

272
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,688
First, the boys are all single.

273
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,273
- Second...
- So are the girls.

274
00:19:08,273 --> 00:19:11,484
They're all wrong,
hooking up right away.

275
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:12,694
It's the first day!

276
00:19:12,694 --> 00:19:14,279
- They're single!
- It's not wrong!

277
00:19:16,114 --> 00:19:18,700
You just can't get attached. Let it go!

278
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,659
It's not complicated.

279
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:21,536
If João...

280
00:19:21,995 --> 00:19:23,580
You hook up. Then you say,

281
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,706
"I can't fall in love on the first day."

282
00:19:24,706 --> 00:19:25,790
Can't do that.

283
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:27,834
The guys should go to that club first,

284
00:19:27,834 --> 00:19:29,627
they all knew they were going to a party,

285
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,504
and then see if they can score there.

286
00:19:31,504 --> 00:19:33,006
- Yes.
- Right. Right.

287
00:19:33,006 --> 00:19:34,090
Score, sure.

288
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,174
Score? That won't work.

289
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,385
They're not all so rational.
People have feelings.

290
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:38,469
He started kissing immediately.

291
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:39,971
The guys are rational,

292
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:41,806
but after a few drinks, they're fucked up.

293
00:19:41,973 --> 00:19:43,516
That's when it gets nasty.

294
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:46,352
- Better order some food.
- It was like this...

295
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:47,604
Let me tell you.

296
00:19:47,604 --> 00:19:50,899
I was at home, in the pool,
making out with a friend of mine.

297
00:19:50,899 --> 00:19:53,902
Making out, for you,
could be a type of flirting.

298
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:55,361
Very cool!

299
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:57,822
You were humping the guy,
making him hump you.

300
00:19:57,822 --> 00:20:00,408
Yeah, humping him.
Then his cousin came over at night,

301
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:02,994
and a friend said to me,

302
00:20:02,994 --> 00:20:05,038
"I'll give you 50 bucks
if you hook up with him."

303
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:06,247
Hook up with the cousin...

304
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:07,415
I said, "I'll win, man!"

305
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,626
Fifty bucks buys you a good meal.

306
00:20:09,626 --> 00:20:11,461
- So, what I did was...
- Man, 50 bucks.

307
00:20:11,711 --> 00:20:14,923
My friend went to get a glass of water,
and I told the guy,

308
00:20:14,923 --> 00:20:17,008
"Come here,
I wanna show you something."

309
00:20:17,508 --> 00:20:19,260
So I went to my bedroom and said,

310
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:21,804
"Shit, is he going to follow me?
I wondered..."

311
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:23,765
So you were already in bed.

312
00:20:23,765 --> 00:20:24,974
"Will he fall for it?"

313
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:27,435
Then he came in and said,
"What's up, Carol?"

314
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:28,895
I said, "Come in."

315
00:20:28,895 --> 00:20:30,021
My God!

316
00:20:30,021 --> 00:20:32,774
So we got it going
and I got my 50 bucks.

317
00:20:32,774 --> 00:20:34,233
And what did you do with it?

318
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:35,985
Buy a sandwich, man.

319
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:40,406
On the first day,
would I flirt with everyone?

320
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:41,783
Yes, but I'd rather wait
and check out things.

321
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,534
I think they should make out
with everyone.

322
00:20:43,534 --> 00:20:46,412
But if that happened to me,
I would kick his ass.

323
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:48,289
What?

324
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:51,125
I wouldn't make up with him again
until I got over it.

325
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,337
Write some lyrics
spilling out my feelings and all.

326
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:56,172
Way to go. A sad country song!

327
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:58,216
I'm a songwriter too.

328
00:20:58,216 --> 00:21:00,969
Get a country duet to play it.
And only after that,

329
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:02,011
I'd go back to him again.

330
00:21:02,011 --> 00:21:05,848
The problem is that a man can get
50 girls and it's all good.

331
00:21:05,848 --> 00:21:08,059
- No.
- Yes, real nice guy. Super cool.

332
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,728
I mean, for society.

333
00:21:10,853 --> 00:21:13,064
For all that matters, he's the man!

334
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:15,024
But if we do it people judge us.

335
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:16,734
Some women can't deal with that.

336
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,695
Guys can get a lot of chicks and...

337
00:21:18,861 --> 00:21:21,197
He's a total jerk,
like those guys over there.

338
00:21:21,197 --> 00:21:24,033
No, just like the boy is saying...
He's the Daddy or something.

339
00:21:24,033 --> 00:21:26,869
Here's what they think.
Some women don't want that.

340
00:21:26,869 --> 00:21:28,913
- They don't want that.
- I understand what you're saying.

341
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:31,874
She won't hook up with several men
or she'll be judged.

342
00:21:31,874 --> 00:21:33,001
That's how it is.

343
00:21:33,001 --> 00:21:34,961
Patriarchy sucks, guys.

344
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:38,006
Girls, you can have whoever you want.

345
00:21:38,006 --> 00:21:41,050
Girls, go crazy! You can screw
as many guys as you want.

346
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:43,469
Who cares what people say?

347
00:21:43,469 --> 00:21:44,637
You have to...

348
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:46,764
No, get them all if you want.

349
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:47,807
It's all good!

350
00:21:47,807 --> 00:21:49,851
I want to see
what that horny chick will do!

351
00:21:49,851 --> 00:21:50,935
Hit play.

352
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:01,779
Let's go.

353
00:22:01,779 --> 00:22:02,780
We're here!

354
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:05,366
Fuck, man, that was crazy!

355
00:22:06,576 --> 00:22:07,910
- Yeah.
- Nice!

356
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:15,168
Nobody's sleeping tonight.

357
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:18,212
Hey, guys,
the party is by the pool, all right?

358
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:22,633
The outdoor pool is for the ones fighting.

359
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,093
The indoor pool is for those who aren't.

360
00:22:57,877 --> 00:22:59,337
What's that?

361
00:23:00,129 --> 00:23:01,672
Am I seeing that?

362
00:23:03,591 --> 00:23:04,717
You see?

363
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:06,886
You're wasting time.

364
00:23:09,222 --> 00:23:11,808
She'll start laughing.
She has already raised her head.

365
00:23:14,018 --> 00:23:16,104
You look like a meerkat.

366
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:17,688
Is that a tennis match?

367
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:22,360
My God!

368
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:25,863
He screws all day?

369
00:23:25,863 --> 00:23:26,989
Blondie, come here.

370
00:23:26,989 --> 00:23:27,990
Just the two of you.

371
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:29,325
Let's talk, seriously.

372
00:23:29,325 --> 00:23:30,493
- Serious talk?
- Yes.

373
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:31,869
Only if it's serious.

374
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:34,372
I'm not going to get mad.
Just a normal talk.

375
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:35,581
Only if it's serious...

376
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:37,125
- Go talk to her. Go.
- I just want a...

377
00:23:37,125 --> 00:23:38,376
Wasn't I supposed to go over there?

378
00:23:38,376 --> 00:23:39,877
No, I'm just a little shy.

379
00:23:39,877 --> 00:23:41,629
He's a gentleman. Let him come to you.

380
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:43,422
Go to a private place to talk.

381
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,675
Go where? But they are busy out there.

382
00:23:45,675 --> 00:23:47,593
We're going to bother them.
He's a cockblocker!

383
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:49,846
Cockblocker, my ass.
There are 200 bedrooms.

384
00:23:49,846 --> 00:23:51,430
Why don't want to pick one?

385
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,349
Never mind. Forget about it.

386
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:54,433
Do you want to stay here?

387
00:23:54,725 --> 00:23:55,810
- You can go to sleep.
- Fine, I will

388
00:23:55,810 --> 00:23:56,811
No!

389
00:23:57,186 --> 00:23:58,271
Guys...

390
00:23:59,272 --> 00:24:00,439
Come here. Lie down here.

391
00:24:00,690 --> 00:24:01,649
Fuck you all!

392
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:05,653
Blondie, he's going to
bring someone here tomorrow.

393
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:07,071
If you cry, I'll kick your ass.

394
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,948
I'm not going to cry, I'm over it.

395
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:11,159
- Right?
- If you guys start making out...

396
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:14,453
If you start kissing him,
that's not cool, okay?

397
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:15,413
Yes.

398
00:24:15,413 --> 00:24:17,832
Will you stop being so loud over there?

399
00:24:18,416 --> 00:24:21,419
Murilo. João is already cockblocking
them upstairs.

400
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,087
Do you think it's easy?

401
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:25,923
I wanna fuck that ass real bad,
but I can't.

402
00:24:26,841 --> 00:24:29,093
Then you say,
"Look, João cried at the party!"

403
00:24:30,094 --> 00:24:32,763
Fuck you! Son of a bitch.

404
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:38,186
You think it's easy for me?

405
00:24:38,186 --> 00:24:39,145
Chill, kid.

406
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:41,606
An eleven-inch cock and I don't...

407
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:43,983
No, go to hell, Luan.

408
00:24:44,609 --> 00:24:46,652
Cover up that dick, motherfucker.

409
00:24:57,371 --> 00:24:59,040
Girl, I'm pissed off.

410
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:02,335
I warned him. You know what's worse?
I warned him. I told him

411
00:25:02,335 --> 00:25:04,837
"Go kiss other girls,
but I won't hook up with you."

412
00:25:04,837 --> 00:25:06,797
I warned him and he said "No."

413
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:08,174
I'm furious.

414
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:23,940
That party was insane, man.

415
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:28,361
Let's turn the lights down,
so it gets dark!

416
00:25:28,569 --> 00:25:31,656
Son of a bitch! I told you.

417
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:34,200
No shit. Really?

418
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,350
Crap, it's really cold, bro.

419
00:26:41,350 --> 00:26:42,518
I'll make some stroganoff.

420
00:26:42,935 --> 00:26:45,021
What time is it?
Let's have coffee.

421
00:26:46,564 --> 00:26:48,024
No way, really?

422
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:49,191
- 5:00.
- Whatever, bro.

423
00:26:49,650 --> 00:26:51,319
- 5:00pm.
- Maybe the clock is broken.

424
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:53,863
What's up, brother?

425
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,448
I'm good, all cool.

426
00:26:56,115 --> 00:26:57,158
Shit!

427
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:58,451
Did you get some rest?

428
00:26:58,451 --> 00:27:00,870
I got some rest.
Have you been awake long?

429
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:02,955
- I just woke up.
- I just woke up.

430
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:05,041
What are you doing?

431
00:27:05,249 --> 00:27:06,334
Get some water.

432
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:08,085
No.

433
00:27:08,669 --> 00:27:09,920
- You okay?
- Yep.

434
00:27:12,256 --> 00:27:13,341
I feel humiliated.

435
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:15,343
"The humiliated will be exalted."

436
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,387
I wasn't crying because of him.
I was drunk.

437
00:27:18,387 --> 00:27:20,222
"I didn't know you'd be so sad."

438
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:22,767
Let me know next time.

439
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,395
That girl got jealous last night?

440
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:27,688
The one I was kissing was.

441
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:29,148
Man, that was funny.

442
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:30,441
Both of them got...

443
00:27:31,275 --> 00:27:32,276
What?

444
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:33,652
Both of them got jealous.

445
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:34,820
Both? Man...

446
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:38,741
You guys kissed at the party
and made her cry on the bus, man.

447
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,411
No, poor thing, man.
Shit, she cried a lot.

448
00:27:42,411 --> 00:27:43,704
Because she got jealous.

449
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:45,414
But I think it was more like...

450
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:47,833
I think it was a mix of...

451
00:27:47,833 --> 00:27:49,835
- Of different feelings.
- That's right.

452
00:27:58,135 --> 00:27:59,678
I hope we get this everyday.

453
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:02,515
You cooked, so you sit
at the head of the table.

454
00:28:02,515 --> 00:28:04,058
- Come over.
- Perfect!

455
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:06,185
- Is this right?
- Where are the ladles?

456
00:28:06,394 --> 00:28:07,311
Where are you sitting, girl?

457
00:28:07,311 --> 00:28:10,564
Someone sit next to me.
For heaven's sake.

458
00:28:10,564 --> 00:28:11,649
Go, go, Thais.

459
00:28:11,649 --> 00:28:14,693
Aren't you going to
pull out the chair for me?

460
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,029
It starts at "Suck it up!"

461
00:28:17,029 --> 00:28:18,406
Just to warm up!

462
00:28:18,406 --> 00:28:20,032
It starts at "Suck it up!"

463
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:21,450
No reason.

464
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:23,119
Did you wake up and remember
it's a beautiful day?

465
00:28:23,119 --> 00:28:24,161
Shit. Good morning.

466
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:25,329
Good morning.

467
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:26,705
I slept all by myself last night.

468
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,582
Did you sleep well?

469
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,085
They're starting already.

470
00:28:31,085 --> 00:28:32,837
Let's eat, guys. Feeling grateful.

471
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:35,673
Go ahead.

472
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:37,383
My gosh!

473
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:39,343
Help yourself, leave the pan for me.

474
00:28:40,970 --> 00:28:42,930
When I was...

475
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:46,392
How about we talk
about the party last night?

476
00:28:46,392 --> 00:28:49,103
- That party wore us out.
- Cut it out, I'm tired. Aren't you?

477
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:50,729
I'm still tired.

478
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:51,939
I'm in good shape, ready to party again.

479
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:54,400
- Brother, I'm good to go!
- Me too!

480
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,318
Man, my calves are all achy.

481
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:59,405
You danced a lot. I danced a lot.

482
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,740
I was totally wasted! Jeez!

483
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:02,950
Yes! Gosh! You and I...

484
00:29:03,784 --> 00:29:05,494
I danced a lot.

485
00:29:05,494 --> 00:29:07,705
Now, the elephant in the room. Tell us.

486
00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:10,624
You cried, but not because of him.
Explain it to us.

487
00:29:10,624 --> 00:29:12,460
- I was fighting with her.
- Did you cry?

488
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:14,753
Because I was drunk.
I wasn't crying because of him.

489
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:17,381
He was like, "I can't believe
you're crying because of me.

490
00:29:17,631 --> 00:29:18,883
"I didn't want to hurt you."

491
00:29:19,341 --> 00:29:21,302
Shit, man, blah, blah, blah...

492
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:23,512
I don't remember bursting out in tears.

493
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:26,557
I remember I was hurt.

494
00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:28,517
But not like crying and sobbing.

495
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:32,771
But Ramon... Now, tell us what happened.

496
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,107
One minute, you're kissing Nath,

497
00:29:35,441 --> 00:29:38,235
and five seconds later
you're kissing this other girl?

498
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:39,612
- It's my lust for life.
- It's life!

499
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:41,614
And where did she come from?

500
00:29:41,614 --> 00:29:42,698
I saw that girl.

501
00:29:42,698 --> 00:29:44,116
You did? You did not!

502
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:45,326
Sometimes Nath,

503
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:47,912
she has her limits.

504
00:29:47,912 --> 00:29:49,663
I don't go around telling stuff, so...

505
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:52,875
She flipped out on him,
and he went looking for another girl.

506
00:29:52,875 --> 00:29:54,210
That's not what happened.

507
00:29:55,586 --> 00:29:58,631
What about this other girl,
Joyce or something?

508
00:30:01,133 --> 00:30:02,384
- João.
- Congratulations on that one.

509
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:03,719
That one was hot.

510
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:05,930
I have to admit, that girl was pretty.

511
00:30:05,930 --> 00:30:07,097
Very pretty.

512
00:30:08,474 --> 00:30:09,558
It was just a kiss.

513
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,310
At least, he didn't bring her home.

514
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:13,103
We wouldn't let him, right?

515
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:14,230
He didn't bring her home.

516
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,523
She wouldn't be allowed in.

517
00:30:21,487 --> 00:30:23,531
Do you need me to buy anything?
I could go out.

518
00:30:23,948 --> 00:30:25,407
Let's decide what we want to cook.

519
00:30:25,407 --> 00:30:27,034
Get stuff for a barbecue.

520
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:28,285
Cheese, garlic bread...

521
00:30:28,285 --> 00:30:30,204
- Garlic bread!
- Garlic bread!

522
00:30:30,204 --> 00:30:31,747
Let's get some garlic bread.

523
00:30:31,747 --> 00:30:32,915
Can you guys help me?

524
00:30:32,915 --> 00:30:34,291
The girls can help me.

525
00:30:34,291 --> 00:30:35,417
Get chocolate too.

526
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,379
Guys, wine.

527
00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:40,297
Wine is super important, man.

528
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:41,882
- We're screwed.
- Guys, let's...

529
00:30:41,882 --> 00:30:45,010
Tay, if Tay could come...
You can drive, right?

530
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:46,345
I'll drive you.

531
00:30:46,345 --> 00:30:47,596
You coming? I'd like to chat.

532
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,348
- Okay?
- Okay.

533
00:30:50,057 --> 00:30:51,058
That's settled, then.

534
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:30,723
How about pizza?

535
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:32,641
Let's get some chicken pizza.

536
00:31:32,641 --> 00:31:33,767
Four-cheese pizza.

537
00:31:33,767 --> 00:31:35,102
Portuguese pizza.

538
00:31:35,102 --> 00:31:36,812
- Pepperoni.
- Chicken, creamy cheese and mozzarella.

539
00:31:36,812 --> 00:31:39,106
Get it. No, get more. Like, four.

540
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:42,234
So we have appetizers for later.

541
00:31:45,946 --> 00:31:48,449
Did you hear Blondie
and João fighting last night?

542
00:31:48,741 --> 00:31:51,785
He was chewing her out non-stop.

543
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:52,786
Blondie, don't you want...

544
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:55,581
When we're drunk, we have feelings
we don't know about.

545
00:31:55,581 --> 00:31:57,374
Man, he makes me laugh so hard!

546
00:31:57,374 --> 00:32:01,670
He looks at me, like,
"So, Murilo, look..."

547
00:32:02,004 --> 00:32:03,339
Let's do something.

548
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:05,966
I'll get a broomstick,
put something on her head...

549
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:10,346
We'll be creative, Joyce.

550
00:32:10,346 --> 00:32:12,181
Funny, we keep talking about her.

551
00:32:12,181 --> 00:32:13,432
Her ears are ringing.

552
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:15,559
Every day, we're talking about Joyce.

553
00:32:16,685 --> 00:32:17,895
Write it down, "Joyce."

554
00:32:22,066 --> 00:32:23,150
He'll laugh so hard,
he'll pee his pants.

555
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:24,276
He'll get attached to this.

556
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,487
- You need to write...
- Joyce Kelly.

557
00:32:27,279 --> 00:32:29,573
- Hold it up like this.
-"Joysse."

558
00:32:29,573 --> 00:32:30,699
Now, "Kelly."

559
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,368
Tonight, he won't kiss Blondie anymore.

560
00:32:38,749 --> 00:32:41,293
Before we get to the house,
just between us...

561
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:44,171
You won't hook up with Thais anymore?
Not even at the party?

562
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:46,173
- No, it's...
- It's not going to happen?

563
00:32:46,465 --> 00:32:48,217
- No, it's...
- Will you go for it or not?

564
00:32:48,217 --> 00:32:50,010
I'm not going for it. I gave up.

565
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:51,428
For real.

566
00:32:51,428 --> 00:32:52,638
I don't want the commitment.

567
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:56,767
I don't want a commitment.

568
00:32:56,892 --> 00:32:57,935
And neither does she.

569
00:32:58,143 --> 00:33:00,896
I told Murilo,
"Wow, a bunch of hot babes."

570
00:33:00,896 --> 00:33:02,731
He said, "Yeah, but they're not my type."

571
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,566
"What is your type?"
And he looked at me.

572
00:33:04,566 --> 00:33:05,609
You!

573
00:33:05,943 --> 00:33:07,027
She's totally in love!

574
00:33:07,027 --> 00:33:10,322
- Girl, you're in love!
- You're totally in love.

575
00:33:10,322 --> 00:33:15,577
I honestly thought that Carioca was
going to hook up with Blondie.

576
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:16,912
And that I would hook up with you.

577
00:33:16,912 --> 00:33:17,955
Are you serious?

578
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:19,456
Honest to God, because...

579
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:20,666
If you cheated on me, I'd get really mad.

580
00:33:20,666 --> 00:33:22,042
I don't know. Maybe.

581
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:23,794
What if I had hit on you first?

582
00:33:23,794 --> 00:33:25,087
What if João had hit on you first?

583
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:27,673
Go ahead, be honest.

584
00:33:28,048 --> 00:33:29,049
No need to say a thing.

585
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:30,676
I got it, João.

586
00:33:30,676 --> 00:33:32,886
You lost your chance, João!

587
00:33:33,137 --> 00:33:34,179
Son of a bitch!

588
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:37,641
I got to the house and Murilo kissed me
right away, like, "That's it.

589
00:33:37,641 --> 00:33:39,643
"I'm kissing this mouth."

590
00:33:39,643 --> 00:33:41,353
You could have been the one.

591
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,313
But now, you're moving to Rio.

592
00:33:43,522 --> 00:33:46,024
- Not me. I'm single.
- If you want...

593
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,860
I'll save you a place in my bed.

594
00:33:50,362 --> 00:33:52,906
You clown.
I won't do that, Blondie is my friend.

595
00:33:53,157 --> 00:33:54,616
Blondie wouldn't mind.

596
00:33:54,616 --> 00:33:56,410
What if we do just the opposite?

597
00:33:56,410 --> 00:34:01,707
For real, I think that if that happens,
Blondie wouldn't be upset.

598
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:04,710
The only one who would mind,
that would be Bia and Luan.

599
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,004
If someone hooks up with Luan,
things would get nasty.

600
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:08,130
- Sure.
- Bia would get mad.

601
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,298
Yes, she would.

602
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:10,382
I said to Luan,

603
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:13,385
"Look, I'm not going to hook up
with anyone else."

604
00:34:13,385 --> 00:34:16,555
He said, "If you hook up with anyone
during the whole vacation,

605
00:34:16,555 --> 00:34:17,639
"will you kiss me?"

606
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:18,724
I said, "Okay."

607
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:20,267
Last night, before everything, he said,

608
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:23,854
"You mean it, right?
Because, if you hook up with someone else,

609
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:26,106
"you'll have to do as you promised."

610
00:34:26,106 --> 00:34:27,858
I said, "No way, I'm not a grass cutter."

611
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:29,234
If you break the promise...

612
00:34:29,234 --> 00:34:30,486
Did Luan say that to you?

613
00:34:30,486 --> 00:34:32,029
...Bia will pull your hair out.

614
00:34:41,997 --> 00:34:43,332
Who's hungry?

615
00:34:43,665 --> 00:34:46,126
- I am!
- I am!

616
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:49,421
You have no idea who came to visit you.

617
00:34:49,755 --> 00:34:50,798
Where?

618
00:34:50,798 --> 00:34:52,591
She's waiting for you upstairs.

619
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:53,675
- Joyce.
- Can... Let's...

620
00:34:53,926 --> 00:34:55,093
Go, João!

621
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,136
João's best friend.

622
00:34:56,261 --> 00:34:58,847
Go, João!

623
00:34:59,306 --> 00:35:00,474
Is my love here?

624
00:35:00,474 --> 00:35:03,143
She's waiting for you in the bedroom.
She can't leave.

625
00:35:03,477 --> 00:35:04,520
She can't get out.

626
00:35:05,479 --> 00:35:07,481
- Ask if you can come in.
- Excuse me?

627
00:35:07,481 --> 00:35:09,775
- You can't come in.
- So, I can't come in?

628
00:35:10,567 --> 00:35:11,693
Fuck you!

629
00:35:18,116 --> 00:35:20,619
Kiss!

630
00:35:33,298 --> 00:35:35,676
- I'm going to start the barbecue now.
- Go.

631
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,742
This is so neat!

632
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:50,125
You're not going to starve.

633
00:36:50,125 --> 00:36:52,711
He'll bring you breakfast in bed everyday.

634
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:54,755
- Just like a princess.
- Like a princess.

635
00:36:56,131 --> 00:36:59,718
Did you see that? Learn how to be
a prince, a gentleman, very polite.

636
00:36:59,718 --> 00:37:02,387
Girlfriend, Ramon is a prince, my friend.

637
00:37:02,387 --> 00:37:03,430
A super prince.

638
00:37:03,430 --> 00:37:05,474
- That was just last night.
- He's not João.

639
00:37:05,474 --> 00:37:06,892
You'll see the prince tonight.

640
00:37:07,517 --> 00:37:08,727
Boy...

641
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:23,492
Hey, Nath?

642
00:37:23,617 --> 00:37:25,202
- Yes?
- Are you ready, love?

643
00:37:25,494 --> 00:37:26,954
- No.
- I can't believe I'm so hot.

644
00:37:27,537 --> 00:37:28,830
Take this heat out of me!

645
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:31,291
Before, it was "love," "Nath,"
"Nath," "love."

646
00:37:31,291 --> 00:37:33,001
Now, it's "love," "baby."

647
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,087
- Nathalia! Are you ready?
-"Nathalia."

648
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:57,567
Thanks. Let's go!

649
00:37:58,568 --> 00:37:59,528
Shit, man.

650
00:38:02,114 --> 00:38:04,032
Check this place out, Murilo.

651
00:38:09,538 --> 00:38:11,456
It has broadened my horizons.

652
00:38:13,083 --> 00:38:14,459
Tonight I'm getting wasted.

653
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:15,961
You'll have to carry me out.

654
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,170
I'll get so wasted...

655
00:38:18,005 --> 00:38:20,841
Check the girls out. Look!

656
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:27,389
Girls, I wanted to meet a hot boy,
but it's hard.

657
00:38:27,973 --> 00:38:29,558
Chill, I've got a good feeling about it.

658
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:32,185
If not tonight, some other time. Relax.

659
00:38:33,186 --> 00:38:34,396
- Where are you from?
- From Rio.

660
00:38:34,396 --> 00:38:35,772
Really? I'm from Rio.

661
00:38:36,398 --> 00:38:37,441
Look me in the eye.

662
00:38:38,066 --> 00:38:39,484
I'm not mature enough.

663
00:38:40,110 --> 00:38:41,069
I'll be mature for us both.

664
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:46,742
I'm not done talking.

665
00:38:47,409 --> 00:38:48,702
If I steal a kiss, would you get mad?

666
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:50,078
- No.
- No?

667
00:38:51,038 --> 00:38:52,748
- Not at all.
- Really?

668
00:38:52,748 --> 00:38:53,999
No?

669
00:39:04,259 --> 00:39:05,886
- Can I nibble on your ear?
- No.

670
00:39:06,178 --> 00:39:07,179
No?

671
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:09,264
My heart is broken. Ridiculous!

672
00:39:11,641 --> 00:39:14,061
You got cheated on.

673
00:39:14,478 --> 00:39:16,480
I got cheated on

674
00:39:17,272 --> 00:39:18,899
In your face!

675
00:39:19,232 --> 00:39:22,903
The guy is such an asshole.
He makes me sick. I'm furious.

676
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:26,198
Don't feel this way.
This is exactly what we came here for.

677
00:39:26,198 --> 00:39:28,283
No, that's not what I came here for.

678
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:31,411
It would be the same thing
if I wanted to control Murilo.

679
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:32,537
How could I control him?

680
00:39:32,537 --> 00:39:34,623
But you don't like it. There's no way...

681
00:39:34,623 --> 00:39:37,459
- You don't like it, obviously.
- Well, yeah, I don't like it.

682
00:39:37,459 --> 00:39:39,878
But karma is a bitch!

683
00:39:40,087 --> 00:39:42,130
You reacted just like I did.
I didn't like that.

684
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:43,548
- What can you do?.
- And he kissed her.

685
00:39:57,229 --> 00:39:58,230
I'm going to fall over.

686
00:39:58,563 --> 00:40:00,107
- Man, you fucking suck.
- Why?

687
00:40:00,107 --> 00:40:04,236
You got cheated on before,
and now you're cheating on him? Payback?

688
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:09,282
Girlfriend.

689
00:40:10,033 --> 00:40:12,160
- Girlfriend, don't fall over.
- Sit down.

690
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,498
We'll get you some water.
Wanna use the restroom?

691
00:40:18,458 --> 00:40:21,044
We'll get you some water.
Wanna use the restroom?

692
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:23,547
You know I was with him, right?
He told you that.

693
00:40:23,547 --> 00:40:24,589
I got cheated on.

694
00:40:24,589 --> 00:40:26,550
I asked him about that.

695
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,218
So sorry.

696
00:40:28,218 --> 00:40:30,470
No, relax, he's all yours.
Because I don't...

697
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:31,763
About that...

698
00:40:32,055 --> 00:40:33,640
I don't think that's the point.

699
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:35,308
You... Fuck you!

700
00:40:35,308 --> 00:40:37,102
- Princess, you...
- Fuck you, Ramon.

701
00:40:37,102 --> 00:40:39,479
What's with you? You're falling down
like crazy.

702
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:41,648
- Your girlfriend is here.
- Fuck you, Ramon.

703
00:40:41,648 --> 00:40:43,900
Go on, then. I was serious.

704
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:46,987
Stop falling down.

705
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:04,087
Shit, what the hell?

706
00:41:05,046 --> 00:41:06,131
For heaven's sake!

707
00:41:06,339 --> 00:41:07,883
No!

708
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:10,927
No somersaults, Nath! For heaven's sake!

709
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:12,929
No!

710
00:41:12,929 --> 00:41:15,432
No somersaults, my friend,
for the love of God!

711
00:41:17,684 --> 00:41:20,145
You're such a sweetheart, you know?
Thank you!

712
00:41:20,437 --> 00:41:21,771
Putting up with me is not easy.

713
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:24,566
And putting up with me and my friends...

714
00:41:25,275 --> 00:41:27,777
Attention, everyone!

715
00:41:29,362 --> 00:41:32,282
Good morning, João!

716
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:35,660
Whoever wants to go to the afterparty,
stick with Daddy!

717
00:41:36,077 --> 00:41:37,370
It's time!

718
00:41:39,331 --> 00:41:40,415
Follow Daddy.

719
00:42:08,818 --> 00:42:11,279
Feeling bad, is one thing.
Being a loser it's another.

720
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:13,031
- No.
- But what happened?

721
00:42:13,031 --> 00:42:14,032
Shit, you're my friend, ok?

722
00:42:14,032 --> 00:42:15,492
He is talking and you...

723
00:42:15,492 --> 00:42:17,118
Do you think she'd be happy

724
00:42:17,244 --> 00:42:18,662
if I talked to you like this?

725
00:42:19,579 --> 00:42:21,039
No, look at me.

726
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,999
Would she like it
if I talked to you like this?

727
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:24,501
- No, she wouldn't.
- So, there.

728
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:29,005
- Okay, fine. I get it.
- That's all.

729
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:36,012
Bia, come here.

730
00:42:36,012 --> 00:42:38,056
Look, you're a grown woman.

731
00:42:39,182 --> 00:42:40,850
Don't lose your mind, okay?

732
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:43,812
That one there is going crazy.

733
00:42:43,812 --> 00:42:45,772
Don't you tell me
not to lose my mind,

734
00:42:45,772 --> 00:42:46,940
we haven't even talked yet.

735
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,692
I'm talking to them, not to you.

736
00:42:48,692 --> 00:42:51,319
No, my hearing is very good.
My hearing is very good.

737
00:42:51,319 --> 00:42:53,905
Then talk to me
before you start talking bullshit.

738
00:42:54,489 --> 00:42:55,407
Talking bullshit?

739
00:42:55,407 --> 00:42:57,200
You're saying
"Stop saying bullshit."

740
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,868
Then you start...

741
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:01,496
Leave it alone, man.

742
00:43:01,496 --> 00:43:03,123
Leave it alone.

743
00:43:20,473 --> 00:43:21,516
We're home!

744
00:43:22,183 --> 00:43:25,562
Make yourselves at home!

745
00:43:25,562 --> 00:43:27,314
Go!

746
00:43:27,314 --> 00:43:29,524
Make yourselves comfortable!

747
00:43:29,524 --> 00:43:31,192
Girlfriend! Check out this view!

748
00:43:31,943 --> 00:43:34,195
Check out this view!

749
00:43:38,283 --> 00:43:40,952
What do you want? Beer? Vodka with ice?

750
00:43:58,178 --> 00:44:00,597
- Cigarette.
- Where can I sleep? Here's fine.

751
00:44:00,597 --> 00:44:02,265
Put a mattress here.

752
00:44:02,265 --> 00:44:03,641
No, come here.

753
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:05,518
Here.

754
00:44:05,685 --> 00:44:06,853
No, not here.

755
00:44:06,853 --> 00:44:08,772
Not this bed. Oh, my God!

756
00:44:08,938 --> 00:44:10,231
Jesus!

757
00:44:10,732 --> 00:44:11,900
Well, then sit on this bed here.

758
00:44:13,401 --> 00:44:14,652
Can I have a cigarette?

759
00:44:14,944 --> 00:44:16,404
I should go upstairs, to see if...

760
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:18,281
You think they're hooking up?

761
00:44:18,281 --> 00:44:19,741
No! They're not.

762
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:20,950
He's just protecting her.

763
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:23,161
She's going to hug and cuddle
with anyone who goes up there.

764
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:26,414
Just like she was with her, with her,
with her and her...

765
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:29,042
So, yeah. Exactly. That's exactly it.
That's what I'm saying.

766
00:44:29,042 --> 00:44:31,252
It was his fault, not hers.
I think she's naughty.

767
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:35,048
Here.

768
00:44:37,258 --> 00:44:38,468
Iced tea.

769
00:44:40,303 --> 00:44:42,055
That tastes horrible.

770
00:44:46,393 --> 00:44:48,645
I don't think she's thinking right, now.

771
00:44:48,645 --> 00:44:50,105
She's drunk. She can't tell...

772
00:44:50,105 --> 00:44:51,773
If one comes to me, then the other...

773
00:44:51,773 --> 00:44:57,362
Please! Get don't let me
and drown me in the pool.

774
00:44:57,362 --> 00:44:59,781
But don't let me,
or shit will hit the fan.

775
00:44:59,781 --> 00:45:02,325
I'll smack one or the other.

776
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:04,702
That's how I am. Fuck it.

777
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:07,497
Tomorrow, when you're sober,
you go talk to him.

778
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:09,833
Just don't let it happen, that's all.

779
00:45:09,833 --> 00:45:11,126
I'm serious. We're family.

780
00:45:11,126 --> 00:45:12,502
She wasn't being a friend.

781
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:14,712
I was acting like a friend.

782
00:45:15,004 --> 00:45:16,172
But she didn't.

783
00:45:16,297 --> 00:45:18,091
We are all family.
Let's all talk when we sober up.

784
00:45:19,134 --> 00:45:21,010
Should hook up with someone else?

785
00:45:21,261 --> 00:45:22,887
You should do whatever you want.

786
00:45:23,847 --> 00:45:24,973
If you feel like it, do it.

787
00:45:24,973 --> 00:45:26,891
- I don't want it anymore.
- Then don't.

788
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,353
If you want to shout, do it.
Fight, if you want to.

789
00:45:31,271 --> 00:45:33,940
You think I'm here with you,
because I want to kiss you?

790
00:45:34,649 --> 00:45:35,733
Because I like you.

791
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:37,944
I don't want you
to make a fool of yourself.

792
00:45:38,528 --> 00:45:39,529
More?

793
00:45:39,529 --> 00:45:40,989
I didn't let you
make a fool of yourself.

794
00:45:40,989 --> 00:45:42,907
And helped you get on the bus, before.

795
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:44,075
Let's tease them.

796
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:46,744
- Are you crazy?
- Let's do it.

797
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:50,248
I'm going to tie your smart-ass tongue
to that thing there.

798
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:53,126
I'm not going downstairs.

799
00:46:04,304 --> 00:46:07,015
Let's go downstairs.

800
00:46:28,161 --> 00:46:30,872
Bia is mad. Don't get near her,
or she'll chew you up.

801
00:46:30,872 --> 00:46:33,583
- Talk to her tomorrow.
- But didn't hook up with Luan.

802
00:46:33,583 --> 00:46:34,626
I know you didn't.

803
00:46:34,626 --> 00:46:37,337
She's still getting over it,
don't try to reason with her.

804
00:46:37,337 --> 00:46:39,297
She's mad at this situation.

805
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:41,758
If you talk to her,
you two will get in a fight.

806
00:46:45,053 --> 00:46:48,306
Hey, pretty thing!

807
00:46:48,556 --> 00:46:50,099
For the record, you're gorgeous!

808
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:51,809
Crap, I fell down.

809
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:54,354
Quiet, quiet, quiet!

810
00:46:55,104 --> 00:46:56,856
Let me get that.

811
00:46:56,856 --> 00:46:58,775
- Hello?
- What the heck?

812
00:46:59,192 --> 00:47:00,235
Good evening.

813
00:47:02,445 --> 00:47:04,405
How are you, Ricardo? You good?

814
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:09,035
What time? Tomorrow?

815
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:11,538
Okay, I'll let them know.

816
00:47:12,330 --> 00:47:14,541
Guys, come on over.
Come here, please, Ramon.

817
00:47:21,714 --> 00:47:23,341
You want to hear the good news
or the bad news first?

818
00:47:23,341 --> 00:47:25,718
- The good news.
- We have to work tomorrow.

819
00:47:25,969 --> 00:47:27,220
- Cool!
- All right?

820
00:47:27,220 --> 00:47:29,138
So we're all going to work.

821
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:31,266
I just wanted everyone to know.

822
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:33,768
I'll let you know the time tomorrow, okay?

823
00:47:33,768 --> 00:47:36,771
You just need to know
that we're working tomorrow, all right?

824
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:37,897
And the good news?

825
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:39,357
Is that we're here in this house.

826
00:47:41,734 --> 00:47:44,070
What time?
Is there a time frame, Murilo?

827
00:47:47,532 --> 00:47:50,702
Listen up.

828
00:47:50,702 --> 00:47:51,869
You should go home.

829
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:54,455
We're going to have to say goodbye.

830
00:47:54,455 --> 00:47:55,582
I knew it.

831
00:47:55,873 --> 00:47:57,250
Because we gotta work tomorrow.

832
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,460
We appreciate you all coming here.

833
00:47:59,836 --> 00:48:03,214
You made our night! It was awesome.

834
00:48:04,173 --> 00:48:05,133
Okay?

835
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:16,102
Sleep well.

836
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:23,151
Be true to yourself, always.

837
00:48:23,151 --> 00:48:24,277
I will. Always.

838
00:48:24,277 --> 00:48:25,695
- Always.
- Always.

839
00:48:25,903 --> 00:48:27,405
Let's be true to ourselves.

840
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:29,240
- Right.
- Always be true to yourself.

841
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:30,491
Character is everything.

842
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:31,618
Take it easy.

843
00:48:31,951 --> 00:48:33,620
I changed my mind.

844
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:37,206
You should have talked to me
instead of talking behind my back.

845
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:41,794
Don't talk to me.

846
00:48:41,794 --> 00:48:43,171
Don't talk shit to me.

847
00:48:43,171 --> 00:48:44,672
I'm right here. I'm a man!

848
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:46,507
And I'm a fucking woman!

849
00:48:46,507 --> 00:48:48,968
- Then say it to my face.
- I think that now,

850
00:48:48,968 --> 00:48:51,471
because I'm a mature person...

851
00:48:51,471 --> 00:48:53,306
- You're drunk, right?
- You, mature?

852
00:48:54,682 --> 00:48:56,017
I'm wasted.

853
00:48:56,017 --> 00:48:58,353
If we talk now, things will get ugly.

854
00:48:58,353 --> 00:49:00,313
- Crystal clear.
- Things will get ugly.

855
00:49:00,313 --> 00:49:01,856
- Really? Why?
- Yes, it will.

856
00:49:01,856 --> 00:49:04,025
- Cause you're selfish.
- I'd rather not talk...

857
00:49:04,025 --> 00:49:05,443
You can't even face your own shit.

858
00:49:05,443 --> 00:49:06,819
I'd rather not talk.

859
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:09,322
- Then why you slept with me?
- I was just chilling.

860
00:49:09,322 --> 00:49:10,573
So we slept together for no reason?

861
00:49:10,573 --> 00:49:11,991
You're pointing a finger at me.

862
00:49:11,991 --> 00:49:13,368
Because I don't want to talk today?

863
00:49:13,368 --> 00:49:15,161
Be yourself. You are being fake.

864
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:16,663
I am being myself!

865
00:49:16,663 --> 00:49:18,289
That's great, so be yourself.

866
00:49:18,289 --> 00:49:20,458
That's it! I don't want to talk to you

867
00:49:20,458 --> 00:49:22,502
or to her because I am drunk and I...

868
00:49:22,502 --> 00:49:23,753
So go upstairs, it's our house.

869
00:49:23,753 --> 00:49:25,463
So, it's our house?

870
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:27,632
That's right,
and I can sit here if I want.

871
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:29,801
He's the one in a relationship with you,

872
00:49:29,801 --> 00:49:30,885
not me, darling.

873
00:49:30,885 --> 00:49:32,095
Okay. But then...

874
00:49:32,095 --> 00:49:33,221
- I'm cool.
- I didn't hook up

875
00:49:33,221 --> 00:49:34,931
with him because I didn't want to...

876
00:49:34,931 --> 00:49:36,140
I don't want to know!

877
00:49:36,140 --> 00:49:37,558
- ...because of you!
- I didn't ask.

878
00:49:37,558 --> 00:49:39,018
I didn't ask him anything.

879
00:49:39,018 --> 00:49:40,937
We're done talking.

880
00:49:40,937 --> 00:49:42,438
You can't even have a conversation.

881
00:49:42,438 --> 00:49:44,565
- Go to bed!
- Enough.

882
00:49:44,565 --> 00:49:45,566
We're done talking.

883
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:48,486
This conversation is fucking over!

884
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:49,654
Shit!

885
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:53,574
He and I are on edge, me and Luan.

886
00:49:54,575 --> 00:49:56,536
I can see that, so awkward.

887
00:49:57,412 --> 00:49:58,663
For two reasons, right?

888
00:49:58,663 --> 00:50:00,498
You know what sucks?
It's all for no reason.

889
00:50:01,249 --> 00:50:02,959
It pisses me off, you know?

890
00:50:03,292 --> 00:50:05,420
But in the end,
we all have our own feelings.

891
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:06,421
it sucks.

892
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:14,387
Come talk to me outside.

893
00:50:15,972 --> 00:50:16,973
Come on.

894
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:19,851
Come on.

895
00:50:30,486 --> 00:50:31,446
Nath must be...

896
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:34,949
Things are going to get nasty.

897
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:37,827
- Right?
- No, for heaven's sake.

898
00:50:40,121 --> 00:50:41,581
Let me hear your version now.

899
00:50:41,998 --> 00:50:44,459
I was with everybody, just like you,
and we were all...

900
00:50:44,459 --> 00:50:46,919
And Nath's guy hooked up
with someone else.

901
00:50:47,170 --> 00:50:48,880
Do you think
I was going to leave her alone?

902
00:50:48,880 --> 00:50:52,884
If I were you, I would have never done
what you did!

903
00:50:52,884 --> 00:50:54,385
Really? You'd leave her on the floor.

904
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:55,636
No, I wouldn't.

905
00:50:55,636 --> 00:50:58,222
- So typical of you.
- But I would talk respectfully.

906
00:50:58,222 --> 00:51:00,266
In my opinion, you didn't.

907
00:51:00,266 --> 00:51:02,769
If you're fucking me,

908
00:51:02,769 --> 00:51:07,231
you're not going to talk like this
to a friend of mine. Do you understand?

909
00:51:07,774 --> 00:51:11,068
If you think this is respectful, fine.

910
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,904
For me, it's not.

911
00:51:12,904 --> 00:51:14,530
- For me, it's not.
- You have a loose screw.

912
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,574
- No, no, no.
- Loose screw.

913
00:51:16,574 --> 00:51:18,034
If I wanted to screw her,

914
00:51:18,034 --> 00:51:20,912
- I would have.
- Wrong. Watch how to talk to me.

915
00:51:20,912 --> 00:51:22,622
You're saying I have a loose screw.

916
00:51:22,622 --> 00:51:24,165
- You do.
- Have I offended you?

917
00:51:24,165 --> 00:51:27,710
Have I, by any chance,
said that you're weak?

918
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:29,462
That, for me, is disrespect.

919
00:51:29,462 --> 00:51:30,713
Learn how to talk to me.

920
00:51:30,713 --> 00:51:33,132
You asked me to come talk to you.

921
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:35,134
- Learn how to talk to me properly.
- I am.

922
00:51:35,134 --> 00:51:37,428
- Got it?
- Stop being a bitch.

923
00:51:37,428 --> 00:51:39,013
Shove that loose screw up your ass.

924
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:43,434
I guess we're done talking.

925
00:51:43,434 --> 00:51:44,977
Because, if that's how you feel about me,

926
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:46,604
we're not on the same vibe anymore.

927
00:51:46,896 --> 00:51:48,856
We haven't been on the same vibe
for a while.

928
00:51:48,856 --> 00:51:50,191
Your head is full of shit.

929
00:52:26,727 --> 00:52:29,188
They're not even married
and he's sleeping on the couch.

930
00:52:29,188 --> 00:52:30,231
See that?

931
00:52:30,231 --> 00:52:33,192
What I think is,
if the shoe fits, wear it.

932
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:36,070
If you're sleeping on the couch,
in your head, you're in trouble,

933
00:52:36,070 --> 00:52:37,196
"Man, that was wrong."

934
00:52:37,405 --> 00:52:38,990
No. If you're upset,
go somewhere else.

935
00:52:38,990 --> 00:52:40,575
He's upset. He stayed away.

936
00:52:41,117 --> 00:52:43,119
I bet she's going to go
talk to him on the couch.

937
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,830
No. She's going to wake up
the next morning, all pretty,

938
00:52:46,205 --> 00:52:47,957
they're going to have a chat
and kiss again,

939
00:52:47,957 --> 00:52:49,584
because nobody has a partner.

940
00:52:49,584 --> 00:52:52,003
I believe it'll all happen
in the same episode.

941
00:52:52,003 --> 00:52:53,421
You can't win
an argument with a woman.

942
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:55,798
I like that. She is Bianca.

943
00:52:56,716 --> 00:52:58,467
I'll say! He better behave.

944
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:00,011
You know what I'd do?

945
00:53:00,011 --> 00:53:02,972
But this is all for fun.
Those guys are there just to...

946
00:53:03,431 --> 00:53:05,182
- You know what I would do?
- What?

947
00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:07,393
I'd do just like I did once...

948
00:53:07,393 --> 00:53:08,561
Another one of her stories.

949
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:11,355
Just like us, right?
I'd do just like I did once...

950
00:53:11,355 --> 00:53:13,316
I'd leave the bedroom door open.

951
00:53:13,316 --> 00:53:15,610
- I would...
- And I'd sleep with the door open.

952
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:19,780
I'd do just like I did once,
when I was singing at a party.

953
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:23,618
I saw something I didn't like
and said, "Give me a hug."

954
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:25,745
- During the show?
- No.

955
00:53:25,745 --> 00:53:28,039
No, the show was over by then.
It was dark.

956
00:53:28,289 --> 00:53:29,874
- Was that your steady boy?
- Yes, he was.

957
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:31,626
I said, "Give me a hug."

958
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:34,712
And he goes, "What happened?"
"Give me a hug."

959
00:53:35,796 --> 00:53:38,049
When he hugged me,
I reached for his rib and pow!

960
00:53:38,466 --> 00:53:39,467
A punch?

961
00:53:39,884 --> 00:53:41,510
Did he smack your face
with his elbow?

962
00:53:42,261 --> 00:53:45,806
If someone punches me like that,
that's what I'd do.

963
00:53:45,806 --> 00:53:47,099
You're fast. Carol, girl!

964
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:48,684
A punch on my rib?

965
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:51,604
But girlfriend, she's super emotional,
he's super emotional,

966
00:53:51,604 --> 00:53:53,689
they are both drunk...

967
00:53:53,689 --> 00:53:55,149
It's a recipe for disaster.

968
00:53:55,274 --> 00:53:56,651
Man, I love her.

969
00:53:56,651 --> 00:53:58,235
But if I'm with a boy

970
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:01,030
and he talks to my friend like that,
come on!

971
00:54:01,489 --> 00:54:02,365
What would you do?

972
00:54:02,365 --> 00:54:04,492
I'd say, "Look, honey, it's over."

973
00:54:04,492 --> 00:54:07,036
Girlfriend, it's the same old story again.

974
00:54:07,536 --> 00:54:08,996
- They're all single.
- Right.

975
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:13,125
I would tell my friend,
"Go get him, knock yourself out.

976
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,586
"But be ready, he'll do the same
with another girl."

977
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:19,632
If you're at a party,
everybody is on their own.

978
00:54:19,757 --> 00:54:21,926
But it's different
if I'm friends with Titto,

979
00:54:22,093 --> 00:54:24,011
I am with you,

980
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:26,430
you go and...

981
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:29,558
We're not stupid. He didn't go take care
of the drunk girl

982
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:31,644
and fight with the other for no reason.

983
00:54:31,644 --> 00:54:32,728
He said that to her, right?

984
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:35,022
He did. No, he said,

985
00:54:35,022 --> 00:54:37,400
"Why am I looking after you?
'Cause I want to kiss you?

986
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:39,652
-"I'm doing this because I like you."
- Of course not.

987
00:54:39,652 --> 00:54:41,112
- No, no, no.

988
00:54:41,112 --> 00:54:42,571
- But he said it.
- No.

989
00:54:42,571 --> 00:54:44,407
It's one thing saying it...

990
00:54:44,407 --> 00:54:46,033
- But he said it.
- When the guy...

991
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:48,285
I can't judge a guy I've known
for 12 hours.

992
00:54:48,285 --> 00:54:50,079
- Let me say something.
- He said it.

993
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:52,164
"I like you and I don't want you
to make a fool of yourself."

994
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:53,708
- Do you think if...
- Okay.

995
00:54:53,708 --> 00:54:56,002
...she encourages him,
he won't go for it?

996
00:54:56,168 --> 00:54:58,129
Drunk? I think...

997
00:54:58,421 --> 00:55:00,339
Let's go back to the metaphor.

998
00:55:00,506 --> 00:55:01,340
I don't think so.

999
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,509
I think he meant well.

1000
00:55:03,718 --> 00:55:06,721
I think he meant well. Seriously.

1001
00:55:07,847 --> 00:55:08,889
I really do.

1002
00:55:09,432 --> 00:55:10,558
I really do.

1003
00:55:12,018 --> 00:55:13,936
He meant well.

1004
00:55:14,103 --> 00:55:15,980
You've never looked after woman
you didn't want to fuck?

1005
00:55:15,980 --> 00:55:17,023
Wait, wait, wait...

1006
00:55:17,023 --> 00:55:19,775
No. You've never looked after a woman
you didn't want to fuck?

1007
00:55:19,984 --> 00:55:22,236
You've never looked after a woman
you didn't want to fuck?

1008
00:55:22,737 --> 00:55:24,655
In those conditions?

1009
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:26,866
Both wasted? No, I don't think so.

1010
00:55:26,866 --> 00:55:28,117
He was less drunk.

1011
00:55:28,284 --> 00:55:29,368
Less drunk, my ass!

1012
00:55:29,368 --> 00:55:31,203
He was talking like a drunk.

1013
00:55:31,203 --> 00:55:33,080
It's just that guys
can hold their liquor better.

1014
00:55:33,080 --> 00:55:34,331
You can't be more drunk or less drunk.

1015
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,083
- Imagine you're in Luan's shoes.
- Okay.

1016
00:55:36,709 --> 00:55:40,588
"Luan is not here, it's Titto, super-hot,
tattoos and all."

1017
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,923
Would you go for it or not?

1018
00:55:42,923 --> 00:55:44,800
- Not at all.
- You're lying.

1019
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:48,262
He was not wrong for taking her upstairs,
that was cute.

1020
00:55:48,471 --> 00:55:51,307
And then he made a scene
in the middle of the party.

1021
00:55:51,307 --> 00:55:52,475
Not cool, love.

1022
00:55:56,145 --> 00:55:59,148
ON THE NEXT EPISODE

1023
00:55:59,148 --> 00:56:00,232
João?

1024
00:56:01,150 --> 00:56:05,404
Don't talk about
what you don't know. No, just shut up.

1025
00:56:05,529 --> 00:56:07,740
I'm your brother, man, I'm your brother.

1026
00:56:07,740 --> 00:56:09,366
She's a total sucker.

1027
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:12,161
Listen. We're not living a simple life,

1028
00:56:12,161 --> 00:56:14,080
we're living big!

1029
00:56:16,457 --> 00:56:17,750
Things will get nasty!

1030
00:56:25,424 --> 00:56:28,427
What's the next episode going to be like?

1031
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:30,054
There will be blood!

1032
00:56:30,054 --> 00:56:33,224
What's the name of the girl who
was crying? I felt bad for her...

1033
00:56:33,224 --> 00:56:34,975
- It's Taynara.
- It's Taynara.

1034
00:56:34,975 --> 00:56:37,686
Jeez, João is pissed off!
I wonder what happened.

1035
00:56:37,686 --> 00:56:40,147
João is pissed off.
Taynara was making a scene...

1036
00:56:40,147 --> 00:56:43,234
- Things are going to get real now.
- A guy came in a motorboat.

1037
00:56:43,776 --> 00:56:45,111
I want to see how this escalates.

1038
00:56:45,111 --> 00:56:47,863
We'll have to wait till next week.
Oh, my God!
