1
00:00:15,099 --> 00:00:16,600
I want to see what's happening.

2
00:00:16,600 --> 00:00:18,686
Guys... garlic bread, no way.

3
00:00:18,686 --> 00:00:20,187
This is not your garlic bread.

4
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:21,814
I brought some garlic bread.

5
00:00:21,814 --> 00:00:23,899
I brought some garlic bread, right, guys?

6
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:26,652
- Guys, garlic bread...
- Today, I'm muerta.

7
00:00:27,653 --> 00:00:31,407
We're back to watch the second last
episode of Wild and Free: Florianópolis.

8
00:00:31,407 --> 00:00:32,324
It's ending.

9
00:00:33,325 --> 00:00:34,160
It's ending.

10
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,828
I was eager to watch this.

11
00:00:36,871 --> 00:00:39,290
You again with this appetizer...

12
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:41,876
I'm dying to watch the next season.

13
00:00:41,876 --> 00:00:45,921
Do you remember the fight between Bia
and Nathália, who argued because of Luan?

14
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:47,465
I remember. Unbelievable.

15
00:00:48,507 --> 00:00:49,633
Unbelievable.

16
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:52,344
They aren't actors, there's no script.

17
00:00:52,344 --> 00:00:53,804
Everything happens freely...

18
00:00:54,805 --> 00:00:55,639
Ouch.

19
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:57,725
That's why they fight,
there's trouble...

20
00:00:58,726 --> 00:00:59,810
Let's watch this?

21
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,061
Press play.

22
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,063
Go, pass me the remote.

23
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:04,523
It's me, fuck!

24
00:01:04,523 --> 00:01:07,026
This is my moment! My moment's come.

25
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,768
WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS

26
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,977
Good morning, guys.

27
00:02:22,977 --> 00:02:24,895
- Look who's up.
- Dear Lord...

28
00:02:28,524 --> 00:02:30,818
- Did you have a good time yesterday?
- Awesome.

29
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:33,404
Good. João is very happy.

30
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:34,613
He is, right?

31
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:37,992
- They said you betrayed me. How so?
- Really?

32
00:02:37,992 --> 00:02:41,954
I swear. I got up from that bean bag
and it seemed my friend had eight heads.

33
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:43,414
I was very dizzy.

34
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:45,708
I don't even remember coming in the house.

35
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:02,641
Bia, let's drive Vic
to the airport with me?

36
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:06,228
- She's leaving already...
- I'm leaving...

37
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:08,439
Let's go.

38
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:29,960
- Guys, Vic is leaving.
- Leaving already?

39
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:32,713
Beautiful!

40
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,507
- Thanks.
- Aren't you going to eat something?

41
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:39,803
- Don't cry...
- Don't cry, Blondie...

42
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,639
See you around...

43
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:44,308
- In Sampa, at the fairs.
- Absolutely...

44
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:02,826
Did you like the guys?

45
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:06,163
Yes, guys. Great people.
You're awesome. You guys rule.

46
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:09,249
I wanted you to stay longer, girl.

47
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,793
What about you and Nath?

48
00:04:11,377 --> 00:04:12,586
Are you okay?

49
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:15,255
Man... She ran up there, girl.

50
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,092
She ran up there and said,

51
00:04:18,092 --> 00:04:20,636
"Bia! Bia! Bia, go downstairs!
Go downstairs!

52
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:25,516
It's Luan!" Bro, I went there
like a fool... I made a scene,

53
00:04:25,516 --> 00:04:29,144
'cause I went downstairs like
a crazy woman, "What's going on here?"

54
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,980
I was pissed.

55
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,023
- Obviously, you know? Pissed, right?
- Yes.

56
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:36,568
Don't you know me?
We're not here for a day, for a week...

57
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:57,881
My friend...

58
00:04:57,881 --> 00:05:02,386
Take care.
You're wonderful, girl. It's near...

59
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:04,054
Yes, it's near.

60
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:06,849
- Bye, baby.
- Bye. Nice to meet you.

61
00:05:06,849 --> 00:05:08,100
Nice to meet you.

62
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,643
Bye, girl.

63
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,604
I'll miss you.

64
00:05:12,604 --> 00:05:15,190
- Bye, take care, girl.
- Take care.

65
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:17,234
Take care.

66
00:05:18,485 --> 00:05:19,611
Kisses.

67
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:22,990
Oh, girl... Yeah.

68
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,867
You'll see her again soon.

69
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:55,564
Here's what I think...

70
00:05:55,564 --> 00:05:57,775
I'll have to like myself,

71
00:05:57,775 --> 00:06:02,654
so I won't accept acting
like a fool anymore...

72
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:06,158
If you don't really want to be with me,

73
00:06:06,158 --> 00:06:09,495
don't sit on the fence
and show me another thing.

74
00:06:09,495 --> 00:06:12,164
Besides confusing yourself,

75
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:14,708
that's your problem...

76
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,418
...involving you in another thing.

77
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,921
- That has nothing to do with it.
- I agree.

78
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:20,839
...nothing to do with your problems.

79
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:23,801
That has nothing to do
with your frustration.

80
00:06:23,801 --> 00:06:29,848
I think it's super honest
we have this conversation...

81
00:06:29,848 --> 00:06:32,851
and talk about it
because I apologized later.

82
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,854
Face your feelings, you know?

83
00:06:35,854 --> 00:06:41,902
Even if it's the opposite
of what you want... you know?

84
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:46,740
I faced mine and accepted them
since the beginning.

85
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,575
I've been doing it the whole time.

86
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,661
- Yes, I know you did.
- But it's like...

87
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:53,747
Unfortunately, it's gone.

88
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,666
I'm going to move on.

89
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:57,334
- Okay.
- So... Take care.

90
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,781
So, guys, I was a little sad, right?

91
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:29,825
Because I was going to leave...

92
00:07:29,825 --> 00:07:32,286
But I managed to leave tomorrow, man.

93
00:07:33,954 --> 00:07:37,082
What are we doing now?

94
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,835
You fag!

95
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,007
What do you want to know?

96
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:47,426
What are we fucking doing tonight, man?

97
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:50,137
We have to celebrate this
at a sertanejo party.

98
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:57,311
Today is the day to enjoy the party,
like this...

99
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:02,399
We're going crazy tonight.

100
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:04,568
I want to see everybody excited.

101
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,321
- We're leaving soon.
- I'll start dressing up.

102
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,990
Aren't you dressed up, princess?

103
00:08:11,617 --> 00:08:12,910
Okay, go.

104
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,975
Thanks for everything.

105
00:08:36,975 --> 00:08:38,644
One for all...

106
00:08:38,644 --> 00:08:42,189
All for one. One for all, all for one.
One for all, all for one.

107
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:46,276
Fuck, man.

108
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,862
Chug, chug, chug, chug.

109
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:38,287
Go!

110
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:40,998
Let's party!

111
00:10:28,295 --> 00:10:31,089
- You've already noticed, right?
- What?

112
00:10:31,089 --> 00:10:35,344
I don't know, you've already noticed
that thing with... your girl.

113
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:38,263
- She's flirting with me a lot.
- She's only looking at you.

114
00:10:38,263 --> 00:10:40,766
It's like, man...

115
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:43,560
- I'm not with her.
- I didn't want to hook up with her.

116
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:45,771
I didn't want to...

117
00:10:45,771 --> 00:10:46,938
Do whatever you want.

118
00:10:46,938 --> 00:10:48,982
No, bro. I don't want to...

119
00:10:48,982 --> 00:10:52,444
If you like her,
I'd never do such a thing.

120
00:10:52,444 --> 00:10:53,779
No, be cool.

121
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:55,447
No, weren't you going to see...

122
00:10:55,447 --> 00:10:59,159
We like each other, but it doesn't work...

123
00:10:59,785 --> 00:11:01,453
Will you be mad
if I hook up with her?

124
00:11:01,453 --> 00:11:03,663
I don't know, man. I have no idea.

125
00:11:03,663 --> 00:11:05,832
No, no. I'm cool, no.

126
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,584
Man, do this for me...

127
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:15,926
- It was because...
- Man, I get sad.

128
00:11:15,926 --> 00:11:19,096
You won't be as sad as I will be.
I won't hook up with her.

129
00:11:19,096 --> 00:11:21,098
- Come on, man.
- That's it, man.

130
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:24,184
- You know, if I hook up with...
- Chill out.

131
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,279
Do you have a lighter?

132
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:39,241
Just in time. Do you have a smoke?

133
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:43,036
Talk to me, heart, how do you...

134
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:44,538
Do you want me to hold yours?

135
00:11:44,955 --> 00:11:47,374
- Man, I was...
- Let me borrow the lighter?

136
00:11:47,374 --> 00:11:52,045
I was talking to the guys. I didn't have
the chance to talk to you about this.

137
00:11:52,963 --> 00:11:54,881
When I first got here, Nath,

138
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,677
I wanted to hook up with you pretty bad.

139
00:11:58,677 --> 00:12:01,513
I talked to him, he was...
I noticed it, too...

140
00:12:01,513 --> 00:12:04,808
I don't know, really,
I got the same feeling from you.

141
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,979
I talked to him and I said
I wanted to hook up with you

142
00:12:08,979 --> 00:12:11,982
and asked him
if he would be mad if I did it.

143
00:12:11,982 --> 00:12:14,568
Then he started to stall a bit.

144
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:16,111
He was totally stalling, like,

145
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:19,281
"No, I'm not with her, chill out,"
and so on.

146
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:22,367
I know that today you guys broke up.

147
00:12:22,367 --> 00:12:24,286
I don't know how it happened...

148
00:12:24,286 --> 00:12:25,745
And...

149
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:29,749
Then I said,
"Man, really, tell me the truth.

150
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,878
Would you mind if we hook up?"
He said, "I would."

151
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:38,049
I asked, "Then, you want to be her?"
He said, "I don't know."

152
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,011
He's like on the fence, you know?

153
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:43,597
We argued because I broke up with him.

154
00:12:43,597 --> 00:12:46,057
That's it. I'll never be chosen
again by anybody.

155
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:48,602
I'm the one who's going to choose,
'cause I can.

156
00:12:48,602 --> 00:12:50,228
I'm not bad-looking...

157
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:53,398
I'm not a fool. You know? No, bro...

158
00:12:53,398 --> 00:12:55,025
- Exactly.
- Fuck him.

159
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:56,651
I'm going to go in.

160
00:12:57,903 --> 00:13:00,697
If it happens, won't you get upset?

161
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,449
Of course not.

162
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,826
- Then give me a hug.
- It's sorted.

163
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:06,995
So, it's going to happen.

164
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,125
You don't have to peck me,
but I want a hug from you.

165
00:13:13,168 --> 00:13:16,087
If it happens, please, don't be sad.

166
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:17,797
Of course not.

167
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:20,008
I admit to everything I feel and do.

168
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:21,468
Let's toast here.

169
00:13:21,468 --> 00:13:22,969
There's a right time...

170
00:13:54,417 --> 00:13:56,586
I got this for you to give to Nath.

171
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:59,714
Go there, act sexy and give her the drink.

172
00:13:59,714 --> 00:14:01,758
Look at my brother.

173
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,886
What's up?

174
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,561
Are you nuts?

175
00:14:13,603 --> 00:14:16,022
- It was like this, I had this.
- So...

176
00:14:16,022 --> 00:14:18,275
He was selling whisky and...

177
00:14:18,275 --> 00:14:19,568
This is Blondie's.

178
00:14:19,568 --> 00:14:22,696
If she tells you, are you coming?
Are you throwing it away?

179
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:24,364
I'm throwing it away.

180
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:25,782
Can I throw it away?

181
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:28,535
You're not doing this to me...

182
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:32,289
You stole from... Hey, Blondie.

183
00:14:33,248 --> 00:14:35,750
You... killed my vibe.

184
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:39,504
Go there, she's there.

185
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,464
You killed the vibe.

186
00:14:42,841 --> 00:14:45,218
Man, you lost your flower.

187
00:14:46,136 --> 00:14:48,096
You didn't accept the flower...

188
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:49,764
I thought he'd stolen from Blondie.

189
00:14:49,764 --> 00:14:52,058
It's mine.
I got it for him to give to you.

190
00:14:53,643 --> 00:14:56,229
Look, I'm going to tell you the truth.

191
00:14:56,229 --> 00:14:57,564
You were very bad.

192
00:14:58,064 --> 00:15:00,233
Forget her.
She doesn't deserve it.

193
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:02,944
- Give the flower to me.
- Man, you know nothing.

194
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,529
I do. You rejected his flower.

195
00:15:04,529 --> 00:15:08,450
I thought he'd taken Blondie's flower.

196
00:15:08,450 --> 00:15:09,993
Do you think he'd do this?

197
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:12,162
You have to know how to be complimented.

198
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,373
The boy didn't...

199
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,710
Jeez, these things don't amaze me anymore.

200
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,545
You're dumb. Tell me...

201
00:15:20,545 --> 00:15:22,297
What a situation, huh?

202
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:49,699
Hey, let's have the afterparty at home.

203
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:54,913
Let's go.

204
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,812
Where's my flower?

205
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:21,690
My flower was torn to pieces.

206
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,821
- I can't see anything.
- This one got blurred.

207
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:32,242
I look fucking amazing in this picture.

208
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:36,746
Jeez, these pictures are crazy.

209
00:16:43,753 --> 00:16:45,588
Say what you have to say.

210
00:16:45,588 --> 00:16:47,298
Let's live one day at a time.

211
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:49,843
This bullshit again?

212
00:16:49,843 --> 00:16:51,845
- What?
- You keep saying the same thing.

213
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,807
But you were the one who said this.

214
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:01,563
Make it work.

215
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:02,689
Me?

216
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:04,524
Let's go.

217
00:17:06,651 --> 00:17:08,611
You're in, right?

218
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:50,653
Let's go.

219
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:47,961
Guys, I'm shocked. I'm shocked.

220
00:18:47,961 --> 00:18:50,421
- I'm shocked.
- Tomás was very ethical.

221
00:18:50,421 --> 00:18:51,965
I didn't find it cool.

222
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,384
He's asking Ramon
if he can hook up with Nath?

223
00:18:54,384 --> 00:18:55,677
Girl, they broke up,

224
00:18:55,677 --> 00:18:57,804
but he knows there's
something going on.

225
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,849
I just thought his approach's
a little different.

226
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:02,517
But it was ethical of him.

227
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:07,730
Girl, I think he had to ask Nathália,
since he's the one who wants her.

228
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:09,524
He didn't have to ask Ramon, like,

229
00:19:09,524 --> 00:19:11,943
"Can I hook up with the girl
you're hooking up with?"

230
00:19:11,943 --> 00:19:13,486
It's a good perspective.

231
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,321
Ethics. That's because among boys...

232
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:16,823
It's a guy thing, you know?

233
00:19:16,823 --> 00:19:18,908
- Men stick together.
- Yes, guys, but...

234
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:21,786
The girl is there like a coin,
in the middle...

235
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:23,413
- No.
- No.

236
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:26,541
- She'll be like a coin if she wants some.
- Yeah.

237
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,668
She's been doing this at times.

238
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,044
She wants some.

239
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:34,132
But he said, "I want to hook up with her,
but my friend is over there."

240
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:36,801
Tomás was explaining himself to Ramon.

241
00:19:36,801 --> 00:19:38,469
Why did he only talk to the guy?

242
00:19:38,469 --> 00:19:39,971
- Why is that?
- Yeah... Yes.

243
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:41,890
It's a guy thing.

244
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,558
Let's try to understand.

245
00:19:43,558 --> 00:19:46,144
So, men stick together
so they don't fight.

246
00:19:46,144 --> 00:19:49,022
Nobody cares about anyone.

247
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,273
Of course they care.

248
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:52,942
Nobody gives up
fucking somebody because...

249
00:19:52,942 --> 00:19:54,736
Stop it!

250
00:19:54,736 --> 00:19:56,654
We don't express our feelings.

251
00:19:56,654 --> 00:20:00,033
Carol, I disagree. Here's what happened.
Turns out one friend said,

252
00:20:00,033 --> 00:20:02,911
"Man, I met an awesome person
and stuff..."

253
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,662
Then he says he's deeply in love.

254
00:20:04,662 --> 00:20:07,248
Then I signed up on a dating app.

255
00:20:07,248 --> 00:20:11,294
I found the guy there, but I didn't
recognize him. We started to talk,

256
00:20:11,294 --> 00:20:15,214
and I remembered he was
that boy and scolded him,

257
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:19,677
"Man, you did this to my friend. My friend
likes you and you're on this app."

258
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:22,889
Even if I wanted to hook up
with him later,

259
00:20:22,889 --> 00:20:25,099
I didn't do it.
I knew he was with my friend.

260
00:20:25,099 --> 00:20:28,061
- I'm loyal to myself. I think...
- No.

261
00:20:28,061 --> 00:20:30,188
I have a friend who says that.

262
00:20:30,188 --> 00:20:33,483
If I didn't think this way...

263
00:20:33,483 --> 00:20:36,444
If I didn't think like this,

264
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:40,448
he wouldn't have tried to kiss me because
he hugged me and came... you know?

265
00:20:40,448 --> 00:20:42,617
Nathália did what she's used to doing.

266
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:44,535
She must've looked at Ramon,

267
00:20:44,535 --> 00:20:46,079
I don't know what happened there.

268
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,539
Regardless if it's right or wrong,

269
00:20:48,539 --> 00:20:50,541
he hit on her. What did she do?

270
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:55,797
Once again, she played, left,
looked to the side, laughed, mocked.

271
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:59,801
Do you think she always does it
to play with Ramon?

272
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:01,844
I think she's not playing with Ramon,

273
00:21:01,844 --> 00:21:03,721
but with that situation, you know?

274
00:21:03,721 --> 00:21:06,849
She wants to feel important, you know?

275
00:21:06,849 --> 00:21:08,309
She wants to show off.

276
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:13,272
She was saying, "I'm hot,
I'm beautiful, I'm this, I'm that."

277
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:16,192
To me, the best-case scenario would be...

278
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:21,239
The best-case scenario would be
if she hooked up with him.

279
00:21:21,239 --> 00:21:23,449
At least both of them wanted
the same thing.

280
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:24,867
She played with him.

281
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,828
In the end, the dude hit on her,

282
00:21:26,953 --> 00:21:29,789
- and she ran away.
- Nathália is a player.

283
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:34,585
She's a player. She plays with everybody
and causes trouble in the entire house.

284
00:21:34,585 --> 00:21:36,421
- What for?
- She likes to provoke.

285
00:21:36,421 --> 00:21:39,298
She says somebody said something
about somebody else...

286
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:42,135
"I'm going to flirt
with the friend, cause trouble..."

287
00:21:42,135 --> 00:21:44,929
Who thought they would never come back?

288
00:21:44,929 --> 00:21:46,889
- Me.
- I never did.

289
00:21:46,889 --> 00:21:49,183
Girl, I don't believe in...

290
00:21:49,183 --> 00:21:51,769
I only believe in looseness.

291
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:56,107
No, girl, their kissing is different.
They like each other.

292
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:58,443
Even if she acts weird, she likes him.

293
00:21:58,443 --> 00:22:00,111
Jealousy...

294
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:02,280
She's doing all that
because she likes him.

295
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:03,656
I think he doesn't like her.

296
00:22:03,656 --> 00:22:06,451
- She hooked up with many guys.
- What guys?

297
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:08,953
- She didn't.
- She fights more than hooks up.

298
00:22:08,953 --> 00:22:12,707
She did.
She summoned that guy from Goiânia.

299
00:22:13,082 --> 00:22:15,126
But she had sex, then she got up.

300
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:17,336
She didn't want to.
She had sex with the guy...

301
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,047
Cool, she had sex and got up.

302
00:22:19,047 --> 00:22:21,049
She didn't spend the night.

303
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:22,425
She didn't cuddle with him.

304
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:25,094
She brought that guy to make him jealous.

305
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:27,513
Carol, the best out of all of us.

306
00:22:27,889 --> 00:22:31,642
I think she invited that friend of hers...
because she likes Ramon.

307
00:22:31,642 --> 00:22:35,104
That's why she didn't stay until the end,
because she likes him.

308
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:39,442
She flirted with Tomás because of him.

309
00:22:39,442 --> 00:22:41,569
She didn't hook up with Tomás
because of him.

310
00:22:41,569 --> 00:22:44,489
She loves badly, but she likes him.

311
00:22:45,281 --> 00:22:47,867
Will this relationship evolve?

312
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,118
I don't think so...

313
00:22:49,118 --> 00:22:52,080
It will be this
on and off relationship forever.

314
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,582
I feel like slapping his face

315
00:22:54,582 --> 00:22:56,501
and saying, "Wake up, you idiot."

316
00:22:56,501 --> 00:22:57,835
Who are you in this situation?

317
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,670
Neither of those two, thank God.

318
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:03,174
- I'm the bean bag.
- He's João.

319
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:04,550
He's João and Blondie.

320
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,554
I think that when we love,
we have different strategies.

321
00:23:08,554 --> 00:23:10,932
But she's not good at strategy, you know?

322
00:23:10,932 --> 00:23:12,892
No, but that's too heavy.

323
00:23:13,017 --> 00:23:15,311
It's not about strategy.

324
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:17,271
It's about knowing...

325
00:23:17,271 --> 00:23:21,109
Like, if you love,
you need to know your limit.

326
00:23:21,109 --> 00:23:23,152
Bro, your life is a war, right?

327
00:23:23,152 --> 00:23:24,695
Her life is a war.

328
00:23:24,695 --> 00:23:27,949
She's always coming up with a plan
to destroy the enemy.

329
00:23:27,949 --> 00:23:30,493
The person she has
a relationship with is her enemy.

330
00:23:30,493 --> 00:23:32,870
Bro, that's the best Titto comment ever.

331
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:34,705
Carol's life is like Battleship.

332
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:36,415
Carol is Sun Tzu, Art of War.

333
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,709
She manipulates...
"That man wants to fuck me?

334
00:23:38,709 --> 00:23:40,461
I'm going to come up with a plan...

335
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:42,296
One mortar shell, if he comes..."

336
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:44,090
She's crazy, man, that woman.

337
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:45,174
I've never done...

338
00:23:45,174 --> 00:23:46,884
To me, it's like, "I want it? Yes."

339
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:50,096
I don't like this strategy...

340
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:52,140
If I want it and she wants it, okay.

341
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,975
If not, "See ya later."

342
00:23:53,975 --> 00:23:58,104
I understand he can have the hots
for other people...

343
00:23:58,104 --> 00:24:00,022
But, man, I wouldn't care.

344
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:01,649
You don't care?

345
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:02,984
Would you allow it?

346
00:24:02,984 --> 00:24:05,820
I'd be cool, because I know...

347
00:24:05,820 --> 00:24:09,699
If I really like the guy.
I'm talking about real examples, okay?

348
00:24:09,699 --> 00:24:12,076
If I like a guy, and he likes me,

349
00:24:12,076 --> 00:24:14,078
We like each other.
That's his environment,

350
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:15,997
parties and bars.

351
00:24:15,997 --> 00:24:17,707
I know he might be there.

352
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,250
But, deep down, he likes me.

353
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,210
So it's like, "Baby? What's going on?

354
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:23,546
Let's go, honey.
What about all these chicks?"

355
00:24:23,546 --> 00:24:24,881
He's going to explain to me.

356
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:27,133
In the end, we'd be laughing about it.

357
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,093
So, you think cheating is okay?

358
00:24:29,093 --> 00:24:31,179
It's not okay.
Attraction is one thing,

359
00:24:31,179 --> 00:24:32,763
liking somebody is another.

360
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:34,348
People feel attracted...

361
00:24:34,348 --> 00:24:35,933
Because of a flirting thing...

362
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,185
I learned one thing.

363
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:39,228
Human beings are not, how do we...

364
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:40,938
When we like only one person?

365
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:42,148
Monogamous. We're not.

366
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:44,358
It's natural we feel attracted to others.

367
00:24:44,358 --> 00:24:47,445
But having the option to hook up
with another person

368
00:24:47,445 --> 00:24:49,906
is totally different from just attraction.

369
00:24:49,906 --> 00:24:51,657
We want to watch this.

370
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:44,585
1 for all
all for 1

371
00:25:45,378 --> 00:25:47,922
I feel lazy, but it's a beautiful day.

372
00:25:47,922 --> 00:25:50,174
It's nice, right? Fresh air...

373
00:25:52,218 --> 00:25:54,428
What do you think about
going out of the house?

374
00:25:56,389 --> 00:25:58,266
- I think it's great.
- Do you?

375
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:09,568
Thank you. So, let's go to the beach?

376
00:26:09,944 --> 00:26:12,113
What's this? Wake up! Wake up, Blondie!

377
00:26:13,406 --> 00:26:14,782
Let's go?

378
00:26:14,782 --> 00:26:16,492
Let's go!

379
00:26:16,492 --> 00:26:20,579
Let's go to the beach!

380
00:26:36,721 --> 00:26:38,556
Look at that!

381
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:42,810
Let's drown...

382
00:26:42,810 --> 00:26:44,603
You're crazy.

383
00:26:58,909 --> 00:27:01,954
This beach is a nude beach... Naturalism.

384
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:04,957
Couples that want to, what is it called...

385
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:06,834
To get naked...

386
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:09,837
Don't do it...

387
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:11,047
Let's go.

388
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:12,423
Go, Luan!

389
00:27:12,423 --> 00:27:14,008
Don't listen to this guy, man.

390
00:27:14,133 --> 00:27:16,594
- I want to see if you're going.
- Me, too.

391
00:27:16,594 --> 00:27:18,804
Just this fool won't go with the others?

392
00:27:18,804 --> 00:27:20,431
Go, baby. Go.

393
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:23,267
I want to see the asses.

394
00:27:23,267 --> 00:27:25,436
I'm going to take my glasses off.

395
00:27:26,354 --> 00:27:27,271
Hey, Ramon!

396
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:29,023
His balls are going to hit the ground.

397
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:30,358
No!

398
00:27:30,358 --> 00:27:32,401
No, your dick is going to be very tiny.

399
00:27:33,069 --> 00:27:34,528
Look how João's is...

400
00:27:38,032 --> 00:27:39,325
I can see it from here.

401
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,828
Where's the ass?

402
00:27:52,922 --> 00:27:54,090
What a funny dick...

403
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:56,509
We want to see the front of your bodies!

404
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:22,159
But you have to shake it.

405
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:23,786
You've got to shake this dick!

406
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,547
- Yeah, man.
- It's here. That's what I like.

407
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:58,404
WELCOME
BABY

408
00:29:00,531 --> 00:29:03,367
- Drink it.
- I said I wanted to talk, right?

409
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:05,619
Drink it!

410
00:29:05,619 --> 00:29:07,246
I said I wanted to talk.

411
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,582
There, bro, can you answer for us?

412
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:12,001
I said I wanted to talk, but I didn't.

413
00:29:12,001 --> 00:29:14,670
- I couldn't...
- Okay, baby. You're forgiven.

414
00:29:18,257 --> 00:29:19,884
Go. Cell phone?

415
00:29:19,884 --> 00:29:21,135
Yeah.

416
00:29:21,135 --> 00:29:22,803
Hi, everybody, how are you?

417
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,764
Once again I'll need you guys at the bar.

418
00:29:26,557 --> 00:29:29,393
Tonight I'm counting
on the girls here. Okay?

419
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:32,229
See you then.

420
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:33,647
This is going...

421
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:36,025
Good one, Ricardão!

422
00:30:02,843 --> 00:30:05,679
I wonder if he's going to separate
the house tonight.

423
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:06,805
We're the bosses.

424
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:08,891
That'd be crazy.

425
00:30:08,891 --> 00:30:10,893
But, for real, those two times...

426
00:30:10,893 --> 00:30:13,354
- For example, those two times...
- In a good way.

427
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:15,481
If we were here by ourselves,

428
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:19,610
we would rock this place in two days.

429
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:24,490
I was single for two days with João,
we fucked four chicks.

430
00:30:25,658 --> 00:30:27,117
That's what I need.

431
00:30:27,117 --> 00:30:29,078
Tonight I'm having sex.

432
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:39,588
They let the boys out, fuck!

433
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,480
WE WENT TO THE RAP PARTY
WE LOVE YOU

434
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:03,362
Guys, I'm glad for this warmup,
you're family!

435
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,072
That's the best night.

436
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:07,324
Tonight's the night.

437
00:31:07,324 --> 00:31:09,076
Let's rock and roll.

438
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:31,515
- I think that's not enough.
- Let's get some air...

439
00:31:31,515 --> 00:31:35,352
I can't right now, but later
I'll drink with you guys, I promise.

440
00:31:35,352 --> 00:31:38,522
As soon as we're off the clock,
we're going to have a drink.

441
00:31:38,522 --> 00:31:41,442
- Are you going to have a drink?
- Of course.

442
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:43,277
- It's a deal.
- Do we have a deal?

443
00:31:44,403 --> 00:31:45,654
Let's do this.

444
00:31:45,988 --> 00:31:47,239
Okay, boys.

445
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,490
Call me if you need me.

446
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:50,659
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

447
00:31:51,201 --> 00:31:52,870
What's up, baby?

448
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,413
What's up, girl...

449
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:56,957
We'll have one drink with them
when we're off the clock.

450
00:31:56,957 --> 00:31:59,710
- You are?
- We are... All of us.

451
00:31:59,710 --> 00:32:02,171
I wonder if the guy from Minas is leaving.

452
00:32:02,171 --> 00:32:04,632
- He wants you.
- You're cute.

453
00:32:19,063 --> 00:32:23,275
Tonight, I'm erasing everybody's memory.

454
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:39,958
This is the real "one for all," right?

455
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:41,210
One for all.

456
00:32:41,210 --> 00:32:43,504
This is the "one for all."

457
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:44,922
One for all!

458
00:32:44,922 --> 00:32:47,007
One for all and all for one!

459
00:32:57,434 --> 00:32:59,019
Come in...

460
00:32:59,019 --> 00:33:01,814
Hey, it's her birthday...
Let's dance for her.

461
00:33:02,898 --> 00:33:04,942
In the middle.

462
00:33:06,402 --> 00:33:07,653
Dance for her.

463
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,613
It's her birthday.

464
00:33:09,613 --> 00:33:11,365
Start, Luan.

465
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,659
You start.

466
00:33:21,959 --> 00:33:23,752
What do you do here?

467
00:33:28,632 --> 00:33:30,509
Hey... What's your name?

468
00:33:37,057 --> 00:33:38,934
Nice to meet you, I'm Luan.

469
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,492
I guess we have to enjoy this...

470
00:33:56,118 --> 00:34:00,205
What happens here, stays here.
We trust each other, so... Forget this.

471
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:03,709
Tomorrow we sort this out
if anybody wants to say...

472
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:05,252
Nobody is saying anything.

473
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:07,004
That's it.

474
00:34:07,004 --> 00:34:09,006
Nobody is saying anything.

475
00:34:09,006 --> 00:34:10,174
The same thing...

476
00:34:10,174 --> 00:34:12,384
What happens at the party,
stays at the party...

477
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:13,719
Nobody is going to scream.

478
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,013
- You know?
- Yes.

479
00:34:16,013 --> 00:34:17,806
If they ask... We say,

480
00:34:17,806 --> 00:34:19,683
"Awesome, we went up on the table

481
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:20,976
- and that's it."
- I recall

482
00:34:21,101 --> 00:34:23,854
Nathália arriving
and I was with another woman...

483
00:34:23,854 --> 00:34:26,565
Are you sleeping on my bed?

484
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,360
That's messed up.

485
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,697
At least, let me see your face.

486
00:34:36,408 --> 00:34:38,076
She wasn't okay.

487
00:34:48,796 --> 00:34:50,047
Get them?

488
00:34:50,047 --> 00:34:52,925
Can you... give me a shot?
One shot, you know?

489
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:54,593
I'm going to pour just a little.

490
00:34:54,593 --> 00:34:56,094
I swear.

491
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:57,429
Just a little.

492
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:58,680
Let's see this...

493
00:35:00,891 --> 00:35:02,226
You've got to represent.

494
00:35:02,226 --> 00:35:04,394
What I say and do
are two different things.

495
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:07,397
I'm going to pour just a little.

496
00:35:08,607 --> 00:35:11,068
Is it just a little?
If that belongs to the bar...

497
00:35:11,068 --> 00:35:13,487
All friends have to drink together.

498
00:35:13,487 --> 00:35:14,863
This is partnership, right?

499
00:35:14,863 --> 00:35:16,657
Can you open your mouth, please?

500
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:29,753
Those could be us, you know?

501
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:33,715
The four of them drank. Congratulations.

502
00:35:34,633 --> 00:35:37,636
I want to invite you guys to our house,
for a warmup.

503
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,054
If you're doing nothing.

504
00:35:39,054 --> 00:35:40,597
Are you in? The four of you?

505
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:41,974
Deal?

506
00:35:41,974 --> 00:35:43,809
- After this?
- Yes, after this.

507
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:05,122
He looks like he has a six pack.

508
00:36:05,122 --> 00:36:06,707
Does he, man? Let's see...

509
00:36:08,458 --> 00:36:10,669
Well...

510
00:36:12,796 --> 00:36:14,256
Can I see it again?

511
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,468
Applause.

512
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:20,554
You deserve more than applause.

513
00:36:20,554 --> 00:36:21,680
Why?

514
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,932
Do I deserve you?

515
00:36:26,727 --> 00:36:29,062
I think you do.

516
00:36:29,688 --> 00:36:31,356
Let's go to the afterparty!

517
00:36:34,067 --> 00:36:36,486
This is going to be wild, man.

518
00:36:36,486 --> 00:36:37,821
Tonight we're the bosses!

519
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:40,032
We're the fucking bosses!

520
00:36:40,032 --> 00:36:41,909
Come here.

521
00:36:56,632 --> 00:36:58,717
Welcome.

522
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,512
Welcome to our humble home.

523
00:37:03,639 --> 00:37:07,267
- This place is rad, right?
- Make yourselves at home, boys.

524
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,270
This place is fucking awesome.

525
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,606
- Is it yours?
- Yeah.

526
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,651
It's ours.

527
00:37:15,651 --> 00:37:17,527
Here is the warm pool, the cold pool.

528
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:20,656
- Is this warm? This?
- The drinks.

529
00:37:21,156 --> 00:37:23,742
- Let's drink.
- Have you been here?

530
00:37:26,203 --> 00:37:28,121
Take a sip...

531
00:37:32,084 --> 00:37:35,379
- Floripa?
- Floripa.

532
00:37:37,381 --> 00:37:39,174
Floripa is on fire!

533
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,470
Our house requires...
Every man has to take his shirt off.

534
00:37:43,470 --> 00:37:47,057
Who's going to be first?
I guess it's you, Vitor.

535
00:37:47,057 --> 00:37:48,684
The room is rad!

536
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:53,146
Look, come here, buddy.

537
00:37:53,146 --> 00:37:54,982
Didn't you say you were my buddy?

538
00:37:54,982 --> 00:37:57,275
I told you I'm going to trust you.

539
00:37:58,902 --> 00:38:00,862
"We went to the rap party..."

540
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:01,780
Let's go...

541
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:03,740
"We love you." Look at my boy.

542
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:05,534
Me and him. This is him, look.

543
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:07,995
- Is this your boyfriend?
- He's my man. Yes.

544
00:38:07,995 --> 00:38:09,246
Okay, and where is he?

545
00:38:09,246 --> 00:38:11,039
He went to the rap party.

546
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:13,959
He seems nice.

547
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:15,711
You guys have to know him.

548
00:38:15,711 --> 00:38:17,379
WE WENT TO THE RAP PARTY!
LOVE YOU

549
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:46,825
I've never played this...

550
00:38:46,825 --> 00:38:49,786
That was my first shot, beginner's luck.

551
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:53,123
Ouch.

552
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:55,000
Where's Nath?

553
00:38:58,336 --> 00:39:00,464
Let's go to the pool.

554
00:39:01,131 --> 00:39:03,008
- Where are we going?
- To the pool.

555
00:39:03,008 --> 00:39:04,843
And I'm going fully dressed?

556
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:05,927
Take the pants off.

557
00:39:14,728 --> 00:39:16,772
Why are you leaving?

558
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:21,485
Man, you have to wait for the boys.
They'd love you guys, really.

559
00:39:21,485 --> 00:39:23,987
- Really?
- It's true, man.

560
00:39:23,987 --> 00:39:26,031
I believe it, but we're leaving.

561
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:28,033
They'd love you guys.

562
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:30,035
All of you... They'd love you.

563
00:39:30,035 --> 00:39:31,995
- See you next time, okay?
- Okay.

564
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,413
Nice to meet you.

565
00:39:33,413 --> 00:39:35,165
Nice to meet you, too.

566
00:39:35,165 --> 00:39:37,167
- God bless you...
- Go for it, have fun.

567
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:38,376
- God bless.
- Bye-bye.

568
00:39:38,376 --> 00:39:39,336
Yeah, you, too.

569
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:58,063
- What is your name?
- Amanda.

570
00:39:58,063 --> 00:39:59,815
- Amanda?
- Amanda Meire.

571
00:40:00,440 --> 00:40:02,442
Amanda Meire...

572
00:40:02,442 --> 00:40:05,278
Nice to meet you, Amanda Meire.
I'm Ramon.

573
00:40:05,278 --> 00:40:07,405
- Do you live here too?
- I'm from Floripa.

574
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,658
- You, too?
- No, I'm from Rio.

575
00:40:09,658 --> 00:40:11,910
Really? Why are you here?

576
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:15,330
I came down here to enjoy holidays.

577
00:40:29,803 --> 00:40:31,221
Let's go, man...

578
00:40:40,188 --> 00:40:42,357
I can tell we're in this together.

579
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:43,692
I see it this way...

580
00:40:43,692 --> 00:40:45,777
Tell her she's not coming with us.

581
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:49,281
- Because she's going to talk...
- That makes no sense...

582
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:51,533
Got it?

583
00:40:51,533 --> 00:40:54,119
I've already seen you with her.

584
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,745
It's the second time I've come here.

585
00:40:55,745 --> 00:40:57,372
I'm going to fuck the hell out of you.

586
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:59,624
You're going to sleep
with your girlfriend.

587
00:40:59,624 --> 00:41:01,835
He's not going to hook up with...

588
00:41:06,131 --> 00:41:09,676
It has to be me, right? It has to be me...

589
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:33,783
Your friend is in trouble here.

590
00:41:33,783 --> 00:41:35,785
Four men looking at her.

591
00:41:36,286 --> 00:41:37,621
She's attracting attention.

592
00:41:37,621 --> 00:41:40,790
You four, go grab her, she's in need.

593
00:41:40,790 --> 00:41:44,252
Bia dates a guy, I know,
who's cool wherever he is.

594
00:42:01,353 --> 00:42:02,854
Oh, my God.

595
00:42:02,854 --> 00:42:04,606
It's hard to be myself.

596
00:42:05,732 --> 00:42:07,359
I'm all wet.

597
00:42:31,967 --> 00:42:33,551
On the ground?

598
00:42:33,551 --> 00:42:35,428
Tay, don't do that.

599
00:42:35,428 --> 00:42:36,471
Tay.

600
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:39,140
Get up, baby.

601
00:42:39,683 --> 00:42:41,601
- Go to bed.
- Why are you up here?

602
00:42:41,601 --> 00:42:44,020
Let's go to bed, okay?

603
00:42:44,020 --> 00:42:46,648
I'm fine... Who let you come up here?

604
00:42:46,648 --> 00:42:48,191
Me. Get a grip. It's cool...

605
00:42:48,191 --> 00:42:49,526
Leave me here.

606
00:42:49,526 --> 00:42:51,361
No, let's go to...

607
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:52,862
I don't want to.

608
00:42:52,862 --> 00:42:54,864
You'll make me lie down on the floor.

609
00:42:54,864 --> 00:42:56,449
The floor is the limit.

610
00:42:57,659 --> 00:43:00,161
That's my saying.

611
00:43:00,787 --> 00:43:02,998
Buddy, the floor makes me drunk.

612
00:43:02,998 --> 00:43:05,083
- Can we lie down there and talk?
- No.

613
00:43:06,418 --> 00:43:08,169
- Just talk, don't worry, bro.
- No.

614
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:10,422
You know we get along.

615
00:43:10,422 --> 00:43:12,841
Man, Murilo is at Art's.

616
00:43:12,841 --> 00:43:14,968
I won't do anything, thinking about him.

617
00:43:14,968 --> 00:43:16,845
He's an asshole.

618
00:43:16,845 --> 00:43:18,471
You are.

619
00:43:21,308 --> 00:43:23,018
The kitchen is full of men.

620
00:43:23,018 --> 00:43:25,562
Jeez, I missed you, baby.

621
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,150
There are some men in the kitchen.

622
00:43:30,734 --> 00:43:32,277
That's not possible.

623
00:43:32,736 --> 00:43:33,778
Hey.

624
00:43:34,654 --> 00:43:37,574
- Cooking our food.
- What?

625
00:43:37,574 --> 00:43:40,577
I don't believe this.

626
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:43,246
What's this, man?

627
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:46,499
I can't believe
you're eating our food, man.

628
00:43:46,499 --> 00:43:48,877
Where's Tay? Where's Tay?

629
00:43:48,877 --> 00:43:50,086
Where's Tay?

630
00:43:50,086 --> 00:43:51,254
- Where's Tay?
- Sleeping.

631
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:53,089
Great, that's good.

632
00:43:53,089 --> 00:43:54,632
Good to know.

633
00:43:55,342 --> 00:43:56,760
I'll cook for the others.

634
00:43:57,677 --> 00:43:59,095
See, I hate these things.

635
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:02,307
If I wanted to go to bed, I'd be in bed.

636
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:05,143
Man, go to bed.

637
00:44:12,609 --> 00:44:15,236
I'm going to take a look upstairs

638
00:44:15,820 --> 00:44:17,614
because...

639
00:44:19,032 --> 00:44:20,367
What's up?

640
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:21,910
This is my boyfriend.

641
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:24,162
- Murilo?
- No, I'm Luan.

642
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:27,665
Fuck, man. We were talking.
I said, "This is Murilo."

643
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:30,794
Is that Luan?

644
00:44:31,711 --> 00:44:33,213
What's up?

645
00:44:33,630 --> 00:44:35,465
- Did you get here alone?
- Yes.

646
00:44:35,465 --> 00:44:39,010
Where's Tay, man?

647
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:41,846
- She's in the bathroom.
- She's just gone downstairs.

648
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,891
- Tay?
- Man, he annoyed me.

649
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:46,267
Which guy annoyed you?

650
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:48,520
There was a guy up there,

651
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:50,230
I was sleeping, and he was there.

652
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:53,691
Who was the guy who was upsetting my girl?

653
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:56,069
- Was it you?
- Go figure...

654
00:44:56,069 --> 00:44:57,946
- Not upsetting...
- Was it you?

655
00:44:57,946 --> 00:45:01,491
Then bounce, or else there's going
to be some ass kicking here.

656
00:45:01,491 --> 00:45:04,119
Thank God your chick was sleeping.

657
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:05,453
Then go downstairs.

658
00:45:05,453 --> 00:45:08,331
You're in our house, you know?
Respect that.

659
00:45:08,331 --> 00:45:10,875
- Take off.
- But...

660
00:45:10,875 --> 00:45:12,001
Take off now.

661
00:45:12,001 --> 00:45:13,503
Or we're going to fight.

662
00:45:13,628 --> 00:45:15,130
Fuck it.

663
00:45:15,130 --> 00:45:19,551
She's just said there was a guy
upsetting her, and she wanted to sleep.

664
00:45:19,551 --> 00:45:21,344
- Who's your chick?
- Take off.

665
00:45:21,344 --> 00:45:23,430
Take off.

666
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:25,682
- Who is she?
- Go home, man.

667
00:45:25,682 --> 00:45:27,308
Leave.

668
00:45:27,308 --> 00:45:29,936
Leave now.

669
00:45:29,936 --> 00:45:32,689
Or else things are going
to get fucking ugly, bro.

670
00:45:32,689 --> 00:45:34,607
Things are going
to get fucking ugly.

671
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:37,652
It has nothing to do with you. Come here.

672
00:45:38,695 --> 00:45:41,156
- I'm cool, man.
- I know you are.

673
00:45:41,698 --> 00:45:44,409
The problem is that Tay...
Tay and Bia have boyfriends.

674
00:45:44,409 --> 00:45:47,454
The guys are going to get jealous
of the others, got it?

675
00:45:51,583 --> 00:45:53,751
What is this, man? How rude...

676
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:54,878
How rude.

677
00:45:54,878 --> 00:45:57,005
Rude, my ass!

678
00:45:57,005 --> 00:45:59,132
You know the party where you were at?

679
00:45:59,132 --> 00:46:01,134
I'm the one who plays there, man.

680
00:46:01,134 --> 00:46:03,386
I was playing there, man.

681
00:46:03,386 --> 00:46:04,387
So, please...

682
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:05,722
You deserve...

683
00:46:05,722 --> 00:46:07,557
You have to respect me.

684
00:46:07,557 --> 00:46:09,392
Nobody has to respect you.

685
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:11,186
Respect is essential.

686
00:46:11,186 --> 00:46:14,397
Please, get out.
Or else there'll be a fight.

687
00:46:14,397 --> 00:46:15,565
Why?

688
00:46:15,565 --> 00:46:19,402
I'm going to call you an Uber.

689
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:27,535
Was it that "chubby"?

690
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:29,579
- Was it him who woke you up?
- Yes.

691
00:46:29,579 --> 00:46:31,247
Fucking asshole!

692
00:46:32,123 --> 00:46:34,918
- He's an asshole.
- Get back here. Stay with me.

693
00:46:34,918 --> 00:46:37,086
I'll stay close because you're wonderful.

694
00:46:37,086 --> 00:46:39,255
I fucking love you.

695
00:46:40,131 --> 00:46:41,216
Me, too.

696
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:44,677
I'm upset tonight. I hate being woken up.

697
00:46:44,677 --> 00:46:46,638
You have no idea how much I love you.

698
00:46:46,638 --> 00:46:48,306
That's cute.

699
00:46:49,891 --> 00:46:50,892
I want a kiss.

700
00:46:50,892 --> 00:46:52,852
...you wouldn't hook up with anybody.

701
00:46:59,025 --> 00:47:00,652
I don't want to go downstairs.

702
00:47:00,652 --> 00:47:02,529
If you don't take off...

703
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:05,990
If you don't take off, I'll kick your ass.

704
00:47:06,741 --> 00:47:08,535
Who woke you up?

705
00:47:09,077 --> 00:47:10,787
It was him, right?

706
00:47:10,787 --> 00:47:13,331
He woke you up, he has to leave.

707
00:47:13,581 --> 00:47:15,250
Go into the room.

708
00:47:15,959 --> 00:47:17,168
Man...

709
00:47:17,627 --> 00:47:19,629
If you don't take off, buddy, you...

710
00:47:19,629 --> 00:47:22,173
- Hey, is that your woman?
- Fuck you.

711
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:23,216
Fuck you, kid!

712
00:47:23,591 --> 00:47:24,842
Get the fuck out.

713
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:26,386
- Get out!
- Easy.

714
00:47:26,803 --> 00:47:27,971
Get out.

715
00:47:27,971 --> 00:47:30,223
Don't touch me.

716
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,268
Easy, easy.

717
00:47:33,268 --> 00:47:35,937
Don't touch me.

718
00:47:35,937 --> 00:47:37,188
Nobody is touching anybody.

719
00:47:37,188 --> 00:47:39,691
You're a fucking jerk.

720
00:47:39,691 --> 00:47:40,733
Get out.

721
00:47:40,733 --> 00:47:42,318
Are you nuts?

722
00:47:42,318 --> 00:47:43,528
Go home!

723
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:46,531
- Easy.
- Get out of my way.

724
00:47:46,531 --> 00:47:48,491
Get out of my way.

725
00:47:48,491 --> 00:47:49,993
Get the hell out.

726
00:47:49,993 --> 00:47:52,745
Take your hand off me.

727
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:55,206
I am what? I am what?

728
00:47:55,707 --> 00:47:57,208
- What?
- What's up?

729
00:47:58,585 --> 00:47:59,752
It's okay.

730
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:01,713
Get your hand off me, bro.

731
00:48:01,713 --> 00:48:03,423
Luan, it's over, I'm going out...

732
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,800
You're next. Are you nuts?

733
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:08,052
- Are you an idiot, bro?
- Be cool.

734
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:09,637
Are you what?

735
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:11,306
What did I say?

736
00:48:11,306 --> 00:48:13,099
Come here.

737
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:15,143
Are you nuts?

738
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:20,231
These guys are facing us. Are you nuts?

739
00:48:20,231 --> 00:48:22,609
Do you want to get in trouble?

740
00:48:22,609 --> 00:48:24,068
Come fucking outside.

741
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:25,987
- I won't go.
- You're leaving.

742
00:48:25,987 --> 00:48:28,156
You don't have an option...

743
00:48:28,156 --> 00:48:29,407
What the hell?

744
00:48:29,407 --> 00:48:30,783
You don't have the option.

745
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:32,118
Leave it to me.

746
00:48:32,118 --> 00:48:33,578
You have no options.

747
00:48:33,578 --> 00:48:36,039
- You know me...
- I don't fucking know you.

748
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:37,957
SECURITY

749
00:48:38,416 --> 00:48:40,835
You don't have the option, kid.
Stay outside.

750
00:48:41,336 --> 00:48:44,172
Fucking leave, fucking leave,
fucking leave.

751
00:48:44,172 --> 00:48:46,591
You know? Get out, buddy. Get out.

752
00:48:46,591 --> 00:48:48,468
- Go outside.
- Brother...

753
00:48:48,468 --> 00:48:49,927
Chill out, be cool.

754
00:48:49,927 --> 00:48:52,180
I didn't pick this fight at the moment...

755
00:48:52,305 --> 00:48:54,307
I know, brother. Don't worry.

756
00:48:54,307 --> 00:48:56,934
You weren't even here
when the fight started.

757
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:58,227
Let me talk to you.

758
00:48:58,561 --> 00:49:00,730
If he leaves, then I'll leave...

759
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:02,815
- Can I talk to you?
- Yes, go ahead.

760
00:49:02,815 --> 00:49:04,359
Are you seeing these bad vibes?

761
00:49:04,359 --> 00:49:07,570
I want to talk to the boys because...
Can I speak?

762
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:09,739
Nath and I brought everybody here.

763
00:49:09,739 --> 00:49:11,324
Nath and I caused all of it.

764
00:49:11,324 --> 00:49:12,700
I fucking liked you.

765
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:16,204
Let's not stay here.
It's a big mess, the guys are not...

766
00:49:16,204 --> 00:49:19,123
I want to talk to you later, you know?

767
00:49:19,582 --> 00:49:21,376
No, I'm leaving. Chill out.

768
00:49:21,668 --> 00:49:24,462
Why did you stay downstairs?
When Tay was sleeping?

769
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:26,381
Was I supposed to leave them?

770
00:49:26,381 --> 00:49:28,049
You were the hostess?

771
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:30,051
Everybody went to bed...

772
00:49:30,051 --> 00:49:31,719
- But you and Blondie?
- Yes...

773
00:49:31,719 --> 00:49:33,971
Blondie was upstairs in the room?

774
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,014
She was...

775
00:49:35,014 --> 00:49:38,851
And you were alone
in the pool like a crazy person?

776
00:49:38,851 --> 00:49:40,937
All right...

777
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:07,255
Can I tell you something?

778
00:50:08,131 --> 00:50:11,134
What's the name of that game
we played here?

779
00:50:12,927 --> 00:50:15,555
When Blondie scored a goal, I did this...

780
00:50:16,347 --> 00:50:19,142
- I gave him a peck.
- Why?

781
00:50:19,142 --> 00:50:22,228
Why were you the only one
to give him a peck? Why you?

782
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:26,190
I don't know...

783
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,442
Okay...

784
00:50:27,442 --> 00:50:28,484
Let me tell you...

785
00:50:28,484 --> 00:50:30,778
Don't blame the others

786
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:32,572
because Bia would've done it...

787
00:50:32,572 --> 00:50:34,824
I'm not blaming anybody.

788
00:50:34,824 --> 00:50:36,951
- I'm telling you, bro.
- It's okay.

789
00:50:36,951 --> 00:50:38,578
Let's move on.

790
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:43,458
It's cool...

791
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,806
Ramonzinho, there's a bunk bed here
if you want to sleep here.

792
00:50:58,806 --> 00:51:00,016
I'm sleeping there.

793
00:51:00,016 --> 00:51:02,393
You're kidding.

794
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:07,982
I'm going to sleep here alone.

795
00:51:11,569 --> 00:51:13,154
Bro...

796
00:51:13,154 --> 00:51:15,948
Those people are crazy, repressed.

797
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:17,533
Everything is funny...

798
00:51:17,533 --> 00:51:20,286
Yes, that's fucking true.

799
00:51:20,953 --> 00:51:23,372
I could have hooked up with all of them.

800
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:26,292
I have to stop being a fool.

801
00:51:39,055 --> 00:51:41,224
That was intense. Good night.

802
00:51:49,732 --> 00:51:53,694
Murilo got there, saw some guys
and wanted to cause trouble.

803
00:51:53,694 --> 00:51:56,697
I think that I'd get there
and would get kind of mad.

804
00:51:56,697 --> 00:51:58,199
- I swear to God...
- You would.

805
00:51:58,199 --> 00:51:59,617
I wouldn't be mad.

806
00:51:59,617 --> 00:52:01,369
It's that same old story...

807
00:52:01,369 --> 00:52:03,120
Tay is cool.

808
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:06,541
The only girls going hard are Nath, right?

809
00:52:06,541 --> 00:52:07,917
And Blondie.

810
00:52:07,917 --> 00:52:09,627
Because the other two are committed.

811
00:52:09,627 --> 00:52:14,423
But until you explain
that things are not what they seem...

812
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:17,552
You're going to look for things
that don't exist, right?

813
00:52:17,552 --> 00:52:18,719
Look for things...

814
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:20,388
- I think that...
- What was taken?

815
00:52:22,807 --> 00:52:25,101
Mariano, have you ever lost anything?

816
00:52:25,101 --> 00:52:26,561
He always says that...

817
00:52:26,561 --> 00:52:28,187
Are you a farmer?

818
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:30,690
Yes, I am.

819
00:52:30,690 --> 00:52:33,025
I'd make a scene. I'd tell the woman off.

820
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:36,571
I think he was refined.
Because I wouldn't leave that way.

821
00:52:36,571 --> 00:52:39,407
"I'll call you an Uber,
and you're getting in the Uber.

822
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:42,159
Okay, buddy?"

823
00:52:42,159 --> 00:52:44,495
What did you say?
What were you going to say?

824
00:52:44,495 --> 00:52:48,040
"I'm going to call you an Uber,
and you're getting in the Uber, okay?"

825
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,626
And she'd leave, right, Carol?

826
00:52:50,626 --> 00:52:52,628
"Get in the Uber,
it's better for you."

827
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:58,718
Man, I think that "chubby"
deserved to be beaten a lot.

828
00:52:58,718 --> 00:53:00,553
When the girls went...

829
00:53:00,553 --> 00:53:02,221
Twenty times, he said, "Get out."

830
00:53:02,221 --> 00:53:03,890
"Why, man? Why?"

831
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:06,767
When the girls went...

832
00:53:06,767 --> 00:53:09,103
- Get their ass kicked.
- When the girls went...

833
00:53:09,103 --> 00:53:10,688
He didn't have to go upstairs.

834
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:14,066
That chick was sleeping.
That girl was drunk, you know?

835
00:53:14,066 --> 00:53:17,945
Sorry, I don't want to separate
this by gender, nothing like that.

836
00:53:17,945 --> 00:53:22,074
But where me and my friends come from...
That thing doesn't exist.

837
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:23,534
You're in this house,

838
00:53:23,534 --> 00:53:25,703
my five friends
and in a house full of women.

839
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:27,830
Men show up.
I'm in the bedroom with a girl.

840
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:29,832
My friends get in trouble downstairs.

841
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:31,792
They kicked out.
Am I staying there?

842
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:34,045
I leave with my buddies.
Are you nuts, man?

843
00:53:34,045 --> 00:53:35,922
You could lose the love of your life.

844
00:53:38,716 --> 00:53:42,094
Baby, let me talk. Let's say there's me...

845
00:53:42,094 --> 00:53:45,348
Me, Pabllo
and Carol with you at a party...

846
00:53:45,348 --> 00:53:47,183
I'd leave with you guys.

847
00:53:47,183 --> 00:53:49,060
I pick a fight
with some friend of yours.

848
00:53:49,060 --> 00:53:50,770
Would you leave your boy?

849
00:53:50,770 --> 00:53:52,021
- Sure.
- Obviously.

850
00:53:52,021 --> 00:53:53,022
Are you nuts?

851
00:53:53,022 --> 00:53:55,107
He's not part of my life.

852
00:53:55,107 --> 00:53:58,152
True boys are rare nowadays.

853
00:53:58,152 --> 00:53:59,236
I'm not needy.

854
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:02,323
Depends on the situation in the bedroom.

855
00:54:02,323 --> 00:54:06,702
If things are on fire,
you're not going to leave.

856
00:54:06,702 --> 00:54:08,913
I don't even have a boner for this.

857
00:54:08,913 --> 00:54:10,831
If I'm there,
and things get messed up...

858
00:54:10,957 --> 00:54:13,542
It's over. You're crazy, bro.

859
00:54:13,542 --> 00:54:15,670
If it's the police, then...

860
00:54:15,670 --> 00:54:18,089
I would leave. Unless the guy is very...

861
00:54:18,214 --> 00:54:19,256
I'd forget about it...

862
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:21,926
You're banging a lot.

863
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:24,887
Then you hear a riot.
"Let me see if it's the police."

864
00:54:24,887 --> 00:54:28,808
It's not, it's trouble.
Do I want to get involved in gossip?

865
00:54:28,808 --> 00:54:30,142
Man, at that moment...

866
00:54:30,142 --> 00:54:32,520
Thais is perfect. I could be in her life.

867
00:54:32,520 --> 00:54:34,939
Do you think I won't help my friends

868
00:54:34,939 --> 00:54:36,691
because I'm banging?

869
00:54:36,691 --> 00:54:38,192
I'd stop.

870
00:54:38,192 --> 00:54:41,070
Let me tell you... Thais fought.

871
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:43,447
Do you know why?
Every day there's gossip.

872
00:54:43,447 --> 00:54:44,824
She was going to lose,

873
00:54:44,824 --> 00:54:46,450
and there'd be another...

874
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,577
There was a mess going on.

875
00:54:48,577 --> 00:54:51,956
Just finish your sex and then go help.

876
00:54:51,956 --> 00:54:54,417
If I wasn't there,
I'd help with something.

877
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:55,751
I guess I'll always help.

878
00:54:55,751 --> 00:54:57,211
If I wasn't there.

879
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:58,754
I guess I'll always help.

880
00:54:58,754 --> 00:55:02,299
Then the man is sucking you off a lot,
you're there coming...

881
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:04,301
Excuse me.

882
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:07,638
And if he wouldn't come with me,
to help, then, "Goodbye, baby."

883
00:55:07,805 --> 00:55:09,306
I'm not that needy.

884
00:55:10,725 --> 00:55:12,852
I'm independent.

885
00:55:12,852 --> 00:55:14,979
- I'm self-sufficient.
- Bianca, life coach.

886
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:16,647
I can't believe...

887
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:18,774
My God.

888
00:55:18,774 --> 00:55:20,484
Nothing...

889
00:55:20,484 --> 00:55:21,694
Oh, my God...

890
00:55:21,694 --> 00:55:23,070
Only one more episode.

891
00:55:23,195 --> 00:55:24,363
I want to take a leak.

892
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:27,033
She wanted
to be in a soap opera.

893
00:55:27,033 --> 00:55:28,701
What is that?

894
00:55:28,701 --> 00:55:29,827
I can't believe.

895
00:55:29,827 --> 00:55:33,164
There's only one more episode, man.

896
00:55:33,164 --> 00:55:37,084
- She's a real actress, guys.
- No, please, no.

897
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:38,044
No!

898
00:55:38,044 --> 00:55:39,670
Director, you asked her...

899
00:55:39,670 --> 00:55:41,756
No, director.

900
00:55:41,756 --> 00:55:42,840
She even lay down.

901
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,134
What did you do to her?

902
00:55:49,388 --> 00:55:50,765
Please.

903
00:55:54,894 --> 00:55:56,479
Lucas,

904
00:55:56,479 --> 00:55:58,272
What did you do to her?

905
00:55:58,272 --> 00:55:59,690
Need help, girl?

906
00:55:59,690 --> 00:56:03,069
I'm not going to see Murilo banging, man.

907
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:07,281
We're going to enjoy
our last day in big style.

908
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:11,619
ON THE NEXT EPISODE

909
00:56:21,087 --> 00:56:22,254
There's got to be trouble.

910
00:56:23,464 --> 00:56:25,174
Asses being kicked. Oh, my God!

911
00:56:25,174 --> 00:56:26,884
Two guys or a guy and a girl?

912
00:56:26,884 --> 00:56:28,135
It was a girl.

913
00:56:28,135 --> 00:56:31,680
I guess that was an editing trick.
I think they were rolling on the lawn

914
00:56:31,680 --> 00:56:33,182
because they were happy.

915
00:56:33,182 --> 00:56:34,517
No, we're pretending...

916
00:56:34,517 --> 00:56:36,769
You roll on the lawn because you're happy?

917
00:56:36,894 --> 00:56:39,647
At Coachella, I rolled on the grass.

918
00:56:39,647 --> 00:56:41,816
Coachella? You were wasted, stoned.

919
00:56:41,941 --> 00:56:44,610
Anyway, when we're happy,
we roll on the lawn.

920
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,445
You saw that girl kicking the door?

921
00:56:46,445 --> 00:56:48,197
Looked like Taynara.

922
00:56:48,197 --> 00:56:49,406
I guess it was Bia.

923
00:56:49,532 --> 00:56:50,616
You think it was Bia?

924
00:56:50,616 --> 00:56:51,700
Bia was...

925
00:56:51,700 --> 00:56:53,285
You saw Bia having an argument.

926
00:56:53,285 --> 00:56:55,329
I think it was with Luan.

927
00:56:55,329 --> 00:56:56,789
Did you see the boy...

928
00:56:56,789 --> 00:57:00,042
Did you see the guy in that week's fight?

929
00:57:00,042 --> 00:57:02,837
That guy who did this to him...

930
00:57:02,837 --> 00:57:05,714
That guy from the house,
who said, "Are you facing me?"

931
00:57:05,714 --> 00:57:07,842
Do you know what happens
on the last episode?

932
00:57:07,842 --> 00:57:09,885
Everybody will find out, baby.

933
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:12,972
They'll find out the boys hooked up
with everybody in the party.

934
00:57:12,972 --> 00:57:14,974
Last episode. Anything can happens.

935
00:57:14,974 --> 00:57:16,475
Oh, my God.

936
00:57:16,475 --> 00:57:18,269
What the hell is that?
