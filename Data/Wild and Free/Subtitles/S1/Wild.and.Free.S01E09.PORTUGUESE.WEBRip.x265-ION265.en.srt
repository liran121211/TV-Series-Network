1
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,684
Let's go, guys!

2
00:00:16,684 --> 00:00:18,853
Don't you feel like getting another one?

3
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:21,522
Really, Titto?

4
00:00:21,522 --> 00:00:22,857
Look at this motherfucker.

5
00:00:22,857 --> 00:00:24,483
Look at this package, you fag.

6
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:26,110
Look, Carol, you're screwed...

7
00:00:26,110 --> 00:00:27,361
This is called a camel toe.

8
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,405
Stop seducing me. Enough.

9
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:33,492
Get out of here. Jesus.

10
00:00:33,492 --> 00:00:34,744
Sniff my stinky feet.

11
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,496
Guys, we're back.

12
00:00:37,496 --> 00:00:39,915
Guys, we're using the same colors.

13
00:00:39,915 --> 00:00:41,417
I'm not, Bia.

14
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:42,752
It's true. Forest green.

15
00:00:43,002 --> 00:00:46,422
The jaguar. The snake. And the forest.

16
00:00:46,422 --> 00:00:48,174
Hey, I'm a plant.

17
00:00:48,174 --> 00:00:49,508
The snake...

18
00:00:50,593 --> 00:00:52,303
I'm a... tree, and he's a plant.

19
00:00:53,387 --> 00:00:54,930
And you are yourself.

20
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,349
Hey, I know this. It's called "holt-holt"?

21
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:01,312
You mean hot roll.

22
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:02,521
"Holt-holt..."

23
00:01:02,521 --> 00:01:04,231
Could you take one and spoon-feed me?

24
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:06,108
Sure, milady. What else do you want?

25
00:01:06,108 --> 00:01:07,276
Spoon-feed me...

26
00:01:07,276 --> 00:01:09,111
- I'll give you...
- Yummy.

27
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:10,529
What do you want?

28
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:11,739
I want you to spoon-feed me.

29
00:01:11,739 --> 00:01:13,199
To spoon-feed you? Wait.

30
00:01:13,199 --> 00:01:17,661
Careful, I'm wearing lipstick.
He has to see it. He must be jealous.

31
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:20,289
- Me? Baby, Titto is nothing to me.
- Open your mouth.

32
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:22,458
You want everything?
Just a piece of it.

33
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:24,794
Girl, Titto is nothing to me.

34
00:01:24,794 --> 00:01:26,796
- Poor thing.
- Put it all. Put it all.

35
00:01:27,379 --> 00:01:28,798
Stop it!

36
00:01:28,798 --> 00:01:30,341
Stop being jealous, crazy girl.

37
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:31,509
Stop it.

38
00:01:32,426 --> 00:01:34,220
- All right, I'm sorry.
- Carol choked.

39
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,679
Are you okay, Carol?

40
00:01:35,679 --> 00:01:39,099
Guys, Carol has to be awarded...
the series' icon prize.

41
00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:42,061
Episode five, cheers. Cheers. Cheers.

42
00:01:42,061 --> 00:01:44,271
Let's toast to what's going
to happen today.

43
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:45,981
Go... Everybody is anxious.

44
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:48,484
I don't want to drink a toast to John.
He doesn't deserve it.

45
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:50,986
Me neither. I thought about João
last week, you know?

46
00:01:51,695 --> 00:01:53,239
Thinking about how he was an icon.

47
00:01:53,864 --> 00:01:57,660
Guys, João surprised me because he had
more sex than anybody in one day.

48
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,371
That's true. And Ramon, too.

49
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:01,997
Because Ramon is a prince.

50
00:02:01,997 --> 00:02:05,876
Guys, seriously, I want to know
how João's life is.

51
00:02:05,876 --> 00:02:08,420
- Because he's...
- Man, João is a mystery to me.

52
00:02:08,420 --> 00:02:10,506
He started being something...

53
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:12,466
We call it a "virgin" in Salvador.
Same here?

54
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,718
Virgin, big time.

55
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:18,389
He started as a virgin,
then he said, "I only date."

56
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:20,266
After a while, baby... I swear...

57
00:02:20,266 --> 00:02:22,852
I'm going to take my shoes off...

58
00:02:22,852 --> 00:02:25,729
I didn't understand why he said he wasn't
a fucker. I'm confused.

59
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:29,608
Girl, he must be mineiro.
He does things quietly.

60
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:32,653
Nice to meet you, do me quietly.

61
00:02:32,653 --> 00:02:36,156
- I don't know anything.
- I want to watch it. Shall we?

62
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,283
I press play, Miss Bianca?

63
00:02:37,283 --> 00:02:38,993
You can, honey.

64
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:42,204
It's her snack!
She's at her house... That's rude.

65
00:02:42,204 --> 00:02:43,998
I remember there was trouble.

66
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,291
Luan and Ramon are going to do
that again.

67
00:02:45,291 --> 00:02:46,375
I'm shocked...

68
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,460
Press play. Use your heel to do it, go.

69
00:02:49,003 --> 00:02:51,171
What a heel, girl.
You killed it, I love it.

70
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:23,871
WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS

71
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:48,896
- Hello?
- Hello? Ricardo?

72
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:52,733
- Hi, Ramon, how's it going?
- How are you, all good?

73
00:03:53,525 --> 00:03:54,360
I'm okay.

74
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,445
I need your help.

75
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:05,287
Trust me. Stay in touch.
Thanks, boss.

76
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:07,581
- Bye.
- Take care.

77
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:09,083
Bye.

78
00:04:14,046 --> 00:04:16,006
Murilo.

79
00:04:16,006 --> 00:04:20,052
Murilo, remember that Sunday when we were
at Acqua talking about the beach,

80
00:04:20,052 --> 00:04:22,179
that you hadn't been
on a beach in ten years?

81
00:04:22,888 --> 00:04:25,766
Do you want to go on a boat ride?

82
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:27,309
Bullshit!

83
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:28,686
Really? Really?

84
00:04:28,686 --> 00:04:30,020
Really?

85
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:35,943
Man! Fuck, let's do this.

86
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:02,553
Fuck, I'm grateful for this wonderful day.

87
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:05,014
Thank you for this moment, universe.
Holy shit.

88
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,712
Let's do it all over again. We're here.

89
00:05:39,256 --> 00:05:40,883
That's it.

90
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:46,263
One for all! All for one! One for all!
And all for one!

91
00:05:47,973 --> 00:05:50,350
Man, look at this island.
It's awesome, man.

92
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:53,187
I'm very grateful.
Look at this, man, look at this water.

93
00:05:53,187 --> 00:05:55,022
Wonderful.

94
00:05:55,022 --> 00:05:57,649
Cool. There's only one house.

95
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:01,361
There's nothing to complain about, just
be grateful for. Cool place.

96
00:06:01,987 --> 00:06:03,989
Go, baby.

97
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:06,700
Go, go. Go, Ramon.

98
00:06:08,869 --> 00:06:10,329
Go, Mauro!

99
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:18,087
Fuck!

100
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:20,506
That's supposed to restore energy.

101
00:06:20,506 --> 00:06:22,841
The ocean took the bad energy
from me, man.

102
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:30,682
Fuck, man. I've never seen this, man.
I'm very happy, man.

103
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:33,852
- You're crazy.
- I've never seen this, man.

104
00:06:33,852 --> 00:06:37,356
You've seen the ocean, ten years later.
Look at this.

105
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:39,024
You deserve it. You deserve it.

106
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,318
Fuck, you deserve it. You deserve it, bro.

107
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:43,112
I'm very happy, man.

108
00:06:53,122 --> 00:06:54,873
- Have we arrived yet?
- Yes.

109
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:05,175
- I'm okay, baby.
- Hey, be careful.

110
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,261
We got the right amount of sunlight.

111
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:08,804
It was beautiful.

112
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:11,598
- We didn't get caught in the rain.
- What about the view?

113
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,475
The view was awesome.

114
00:07:13,475 --> 00:07:15,686
Now, I just want to take a warm bath,

115
00:07:15,686 --> 00:07:19,606
warm up my balls
because my dick has shrunk.

116
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:23,610
It's all wet.

117
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,904
- You have to sit down to piss.
- Poor him.

118
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,532
It's in the cave.

119
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:47,593
Let me tell you something...
I was talking to a friend who surfs,

120
00:07:47,593 --> 00:07:49,678
and he said there's
a cool bar we can go to...

121
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:51,597
Let's check this bar out tonight.

122
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:57,060
Let's go to this bar
and have some craft beer, man.

123
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:02,232
Tonight, we're going to this bar.
Let's go, let's go.

124
00:08:07,821 --> 00:08:10,908
Look, guys, thanks a lot
for sharing one more night...

125
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:12,743
Do you think I'm going to drop it?

126
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:18,332
...for sharing these wonderful moments
with all of you.

127
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:19,416
Do you know why?

128
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:23,712
Because the day today was awesome,
and the night is just getting started.

129
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:24,796
Do you know what I want?

130
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,924
I want more!

131
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:33,222
Let's do this,
because you only live if you fuck.

132
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:42,397
- Ouch.
- It's the Tiger Room.

133
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,836
Who do you like?
That blond girl or this...

134
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:05,921
I prefer the brunette.

135
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:12,427
Me, too, I swear.
But let's call both of them over.

136
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:14,137
That blond girl is too hot, man.

137
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,722
She's not my type.

138
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:18,934
Forget about the blond... Get
the brunette, what's left over is mine.

139
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:22,104
Maybe we hook up with both
of them together, think about it.

140
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:26,149
Let's go, brother. It's time to let it go
and fuck all the girls, bro.

141
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,194
I want you to do this for me.

142
00:09:29,695 --> 00:09:34,408
If you hook up with Nath again,

143
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:37,869
I'll slap you in the face.
I'll punch you in the face.

144
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:40,330
That's it. Cheers.

145
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,670
Let the naughty ones out, man.

146
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:52,092
I didn't sleep like this, you know?

147
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:56,596
No? You acted like a saint.
The others didn't...

148
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,683
If you sleep with somebody like this...

149
00:09:59,683 --> 00:10:03,312
You can't do it with that
naughty girl I slept with.

150
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:19,578
- What's your name?
- Ramon, what about yours?

151
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:21,705
- Ramon?
- Susan.

152
00:10:40,474 --> 00:10:42,017
Stop it.

153
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:45,979
Really? Are you jealous of Ramon?

154
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:49,775
I have nothing with him.
If I did, I'd tell you.

155
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:54,529
Okay... What I want to know
makes no sense.

156
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,033
I'm going to sleep with you, baby.

157
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:01,078
- Not today.
- Yes, today.

158
00:11:01,703 --> 00:11:03,205
- I'm leaving.
- Don't.

159
00:11:03,205 --> 00:11:04,539
Yo, kids!

160
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:08,210
Listen up.

161
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:12,547
Let's go to the afterparty.
The bus is here.

162
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:19,638
Let's go. Come on, come on.

163
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:21,306
Everybody!

164
00:11:22,599 --> 00:11:24,893
Chill out. You're with me.

165
00:11:24,893 --> 00:11:30,732
Let's go, let's go.
You're invited. You can come.

166
00:11:58,176 --> 00:12:01,471
Let it go! Home! Finally.

167
00:12:05,934 --> 00:12:08,437
What's this place, man?

168
00:12:10,689 --> 00:12:13,358
We just need ice.

169
00:12:14,276 --> 00:12:15,652
Look at this, man.

170
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:18,488
- Is this ours?
- Yes.

171
00:12:18,488 --> 00:12:20,490
Really...

172
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,377
- Why are you like this?
- What do you want to hear?

173
00:12:32,377 --> 00:12:34,212
I want to know the truth.

174
00:12:34,212 --> 00:12:35,797
- What do you want to hear?
- The truth.

175
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,342
Really? Do you want to hear it?

176
00:12:40,594 --> 00:12:42,762
Really? I won't tell you.

177
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,848
Yes. Say it...

178
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:02,449
So I don't look bad to you?

179
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:03,783
Look bad to me? Like that...

180
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,327
No, that crazy man almost...

181
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:06,870
Who? What?

182
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,413
- What is it, guys?
- What is it?

183
00:13:08,413 --> 00:13:10,332
Mauro is mad at me because of you.

184
00:13:10,332 --> 00:13:11,708
I did nothing to you.

185
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:14,085
- I know.
- Okay.

186
00:13:14,085 --> 00:13:15,754
- I know.
- Is he mad at me? No...

187
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:16,713
He's mad at me.

188
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:19,299
Okay, but you have to fix this with him...

189
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:23,386
Look, you started hooking up... We settled
everything that had to be settled.

190
00:13:23,386 --> 00:13:25,305
I'd never disrespect either of you.

191
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,431
- Really?
- Yes.

192
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:29,392
I won't get involved because
you have to settle this.

193
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:32,729
- That's enough.
- That's it.

194
00:13:39,903 --> 00:13:42,864
Mauro, grow up.

195
00:13:42,864 --> 00:13:45,116
Grow up, me? I've already grown up a lot.

196
00:13:45,116 --> 00:13:48,286
For Christ's sake. Ramon, did we hook up?

197
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:50,956
- No.
- Man, when did I say this?

198
00:13:50,956 --> 00:13:53,291
What the fuck are you talking about?

199
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,876
What are you talking about?

200
00:13:54,876 --> 00:13:57,045
I didn't hook up with him.

201
00:13:57,045 --> 00:13:58,922
I've just said it, I'll say it again.

202
00:13:58,922 --> 00:14:02,384
Do I want to hook up with him? Yes.
Am I jealous of him? Yes.

203
00:14:02,384 --> 00:14:03,927
That's the guy I...

204
00:14:03,927 --> 00:14:05,595
Why am I talking to you?

205
00:14:05,595 --> 00:14:08,765
I did nothing.
Why are you suspicious of me?

206
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,850
Do you want to curse me out? Curse me out.

207
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,186
You should charge for this show
you're putting on.

208
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,439
No, bro.

209
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,958
What? You owe me? I have nothing
to forgive for. Chill out.

210
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,668
Pound it, pound it.

211
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:39,337
You want to give me a high five
'cause you're pissed.

212
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:42,215
I wanted to know why.

213
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:45,427
Because you know, man. Come on.
No... Damn...

214
00:14:45,802 --> 00:14:47,762
I don't want...
you to get mad at me.

215
00:14:47,762 --> 00:14:50,515
- Do you want me to leave with you?
- You're crazy.

216
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:53,268
So, you want to do this? I'll do it.

217
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:54,978
I won't allow it.

218
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:57,814
There it is. Talk to me, bro.

219
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:58,982
I'm talking, wait.

220
00:14:58,982 --> 00:15:00,775
I'm going to cause trouble.

221
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:04,321
Fuck. You're crazy.

222
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:05,780
You know what?

223
00:15:15,248 --> 00:15:19,794
I did nothing, man. What did I do?

224
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:22,714
I must've done something.

225
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:22,607
I'm dying, help.

226
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:37,997
Fat scrambled eggs by Ramon.
I want you to join us to eat.

227
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:41,376
Yesterday Nath said,
"I'm leaving with you. You'll see.

228
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:43,086
I'm going upstairs to pack my bags now."

229
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:44,629
She went upstairs and fell asleep.

230
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:47,090
No way, Murilão, really?

231
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,050
She didn't even say goodbye to him.

232
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,635
Didn't you see what
she did on the table?

233
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:52,053
- No.
- I heard it.

234
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:54,264
She was here annoying him,

235
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:56,224
"I don't know, man."

236
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:58,852
What? She put him and Ramon down

237
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:01,604
and went upstairs saying,
"I want him!" Then pointed to Ramon.

238
00:17:01,604 --> 00:17:04,441
She said she likes you.

239
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:06,776
Shut up.

240
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:20,832
- I'm really sorry.
- About what?

241
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,251
About saying things to Mauro.

242
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:25,295
Because of what you said, right?

243
00:17:25,295 --> 00:17:27,589
I'm very upset.

244
00:17:28,631 --> 00:17:30,508
I wouldn't care if it was another person.

245
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,052
Dude didn't deserve it.

246
00:17:33,595 --> 00:17:36,264
- But I did nothing, like...
- Yeah, right.

247
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,601
Nothing happened,
he just got jealous...

248
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:40,977
You think?

249
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,437
...of us dancing.

250
00:17:42,437 --> 00:17:43,730
Sure thing.

251
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:47,984
Then he said, "You know what?
They're made for each other."

252
00:17:49,861 --> 00:17:51,946
I was daydreaming.

253
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:54,491
I was wasted and said,
"What are you talking about?"

254
00:17:55,658 --> 00:17:57,243
Then...

255
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:01,331
The problem is that
I want to settle things

256
00:18:01,331 --> 00:18:04,083
- immediately.
- Sometimes, you don't get to do that.

257
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:08,087
When I'm drunk, I want to settle things

258
00:18:10,298 --> 00:18:13,009
and... I ended up saying too much.

259
00:18:20,350 --> 00:18:25,271
Do you remember that party
we were invited to, at that DJ's place?

260
00:18:25,271 --> 00:18:27,816
Let's get ready.

261
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:30,193
Drink for free? Let's go!

262
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:31,569
Bro, like, dude wants...

263
00:18:44,249 --> 00:18:48,002
Take it, take it, take it,
Take it, take it, hot girl

264
00:19:03,935 --> 00:19:05,728
Let's go!

265
00:19:20,743 --> 00:19:22,161
Wonderful!

266
00:19:34,132 --> 00:19:36,301
Summer here is crazy. Like...

267
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:38,595
I play in the band besides working.

268
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:42,223
Man, there's three parties every day.

269
00:19:42,223 --> 00:19:43,683
Every day.

270
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:47,020
I've been here.

271
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:49,063
I've already been here before.

272
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:22,805
I saw you talking to the blond guy.

273
00:20:23,806 --> 00:20:25,391
Stop it, you're going down.

274
00:20:26,601 --> 00:20:27,727
Did it work?

275
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,938
- He's a good person.
- He's hot.

276
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:31,898
- Very hot.
- Very hot.

277
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:34,651
I hope Murilo doesn't
hear me saying this, but he's hot.

278
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:36,778
Ramonzinho is out of the picture?

279
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,907
Have you seen the phoenix?
Rising from ashes.

280
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,283
That's what he did...

281
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:46,913
If you want to kiss somebody,
don't let Ramon stand in your way.

282
00:21:12,689 --> 00:21:16,651
You're beautiful! You know it.

283
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:18,319
Inside and out.

284
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:24,283
I tried not to say that I love you.

285
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:41,884
Ramon was talking to me.
We were dancing and...

286
00:21:41,884 --> 00:21:45,471
He said, "You're beautiful,
you know it, inside and out..." and stuff.

287
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:48,391
Then he said,
"I'm trying not to say that I love you."

288
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:51,769
Man, you're out of your mind.

289
00:21:51,769 --> 00:21:53,730
You're out of your mind, as usual.

290
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:55,273
Was he tricking me?

291
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:58,234
- No, you're out of your mind, as usual.
- Why?

292
00:21:58,234 --> 00:22:00,069
You're ruining everything.

293
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,779
Why don't you hook up with that guy?

294
00:22:02,739 --> 00:22:04,490
Fuck, cut it out.

295
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,870
Is she going to talk to him?

296
00:22:09,370 --> 00:22:11,122
Come on, baby.

297
00:22:12,874 --> 00:22:15,501
- I don't get it.
- Things are not like this.

298
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,628
I don't think it's a problem.

299
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:19,130
Things are not like this.

300
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,591
If I was in his shoes, you'd be hurting.

301
00:22:21,591 --> 00:22:25,094
- Can I be honest?
- So, he's not talking to anyone?

302
00:22:25,094 --> 00:22:28,723
No. That woman hat he hooked up with,
that he took home.

303
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:30,141
She came here...

304
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:32,769
I saw it, in front of me.

305
00:22:32,769 --> 00:22:34,979
That woman came here wanting him,

306
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:36,939
he said, " I don't want you."

307
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,900
But both situations are different.

308
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:41,819
- That's okay.
- It's totally different.

309
00:22:41,819 --> 00:22:45,239
No, don't get involved.
I don't want you to, but you know what?

310
00:22:45,239 --> 00:22:48,076
People will start saying,
"Ramon this, Ramon that. Move on."

311
00:22:48,076 --> 00:22:52,622
And when I see him talking
to some other girl, I get pissed and say,

312
00:22:52,622 --> 00:22:55,458
"Bro, I wonder if people are right."
I get like this...

313
00:22:56,167 --> 00:22:57,251
I don't know. Why?

314
00:22:57,251 --> 00:22:59,879
But did you see who started tonight?

315
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:01,672
- What?
- Talking to other people.

316
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:05,510
- It was you.
- But... Let me speak.

317
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:10,098
Ramon was cool.

318
00:23:10,098 --> 00:23:11,808
After we fought,

319
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,144
I admired Ramon
because he knew how to move on.

320
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:18,106
He treated Mauro so fucking well.

321
00:23:18,106 --> 00:23:20,650
He showed that he's not a child.

322
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,985
I told him, "Man, you're not a man..."

323
00:23:23,611 --> 00:23:27,281
I noticed that's not the case,
but it happens, that's chance.

324
00:23:27,281 --> 00:23:28,658
I'm here for the party.

325
00:23:28,658 --> 00:23:29,826
You can keep on talking.

326
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:31,911
It's a good thing to let her boy know.

327
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:36,582
Not boy, it's a casual date.

328
00:23:36,582 --> 00:23:37,750
That's fair.

329
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,044
- That's what I told you.
- You told me.

330
00:23:40,044 --> 00:23:41,504
You see? I told him.

331
00:23:42,046 --> 00:23:44,340
Right, but... What are you telling them?

332
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:52,765
That she wants to hook up with him,
but he's afraid of what happened and all.

333
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:55,226
I think that's not it.

334
00:23:57,145 --> 00:23:58,354
Do you think he's lying?

335
00:23:58,354 --> 00:24:01,482
I think she has to think straight,
you know?

336
00:24:01,482 --> 00:24:05,027
Because he made a mistake,
but you screwed up, girl.

337
00:24:05,027 --> 00:24:08,948
Get it? You said you loved Mauro and him.

338
00:24:08,948 --> 00:24:10,783
Fuck!

339
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,869
- Make up your mind, got it?
- Not love.

340
00:24:12,869 --> 00:24:17,790
If you want to hook up with the dude...
If you want to, do whatever you want.

341
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:19,417
Right? You're free.

342
00:24:19,417 --> 00:24:22,670
- That's the way out. You're free.
- Don't be a phony and say,

343
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,922
"I wanted Ramon."

344
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:27,133
Yeah, that's enough of that.

345
00:24:27,133 --> 00:24:29,051
Got it?

346
00:24:29,051 --> 00:24:32,388
Don't do this. It's looking bad, really.

347
00:24:32,388 --> 00:24:34,307
I'm saying this as your friend.

348
00:24:34,307 --> 00:24:36,642
I don't know what's going on,
but cut it out.

349
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,519
You know everything.

350
00:24:41,647 --> 00:24:42,815
You know?

351
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:08,674
Guys, this party was something, huh?

352
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:10,635
Beatriz, I love you!

353
00:25:10,635 --> 00:25:12,261
Beatriz took her to task.

354
00:25:12,261 --> 00:25:14,764
She left upset.
Now she's going to take Beatriz down.

355
00:25:14,764 --> 00:25:16,265
No, girl...

356
00:25:16,265 --> 00:25:19,852
When you don't want
to hear the truth, you act like this...

357
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:22,438
Ramon looks like he's from Goiânia.

358
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:25,733
I think Ramon is doing that
so she doesn't hook up with the blond guy.

359
00:25:25,733 --> 00:25:28,736
They're saying in the house
that she's a screwup.

360
00:25:28,736 --> 00:25:31,030
She's hurting because of Ramon.

361
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:34,408
She acted like crazy,
said the guy was a piece of shit, a child,

362
00:25:34,408 --> 00:25:36,244
that she regretted meeting him.

363
00:25:36,244 --> 00:25:40,081
She hooked up with that boy she ordered,
things are not going her way.

364
00:25:40,081 --> 00:25:42,124
Guys, let's be honest.

365
00:25:42,583 --> 00:25:46,087
It failed. She's trying to force
a relationship that doesn't exist.

366
00:25:46,087 --> 00:25:50,925
I think Ramon is feeling worse 'cause
of the situation, not 'cause he likes her.

367
00:25:50,925 --> 00:25:52,260
I think...

368
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,803
she doesn't like him.

369
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:55,680
She was playing with him.

370
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,307
It backfired.

371
00:25:58,307 --> 00:25:59,892
He doesn't care about her anymore.

372
00:25:59,892 --> 00:26:01,936
Do you think he's not into her?

373
00:26:01,936 --> 00:26:03,437
- I agree with you.
- No...

374
00:26:03,437 --> 00:26:06,148
I think Ramon's attitude was great,

375
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:09,277
because he moved on,
he was hooking up with a girl.

376
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,070
And that other one...

377
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:12,780
I think he didn't move on.

378
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:16,742
After that talk they had,
I think he wants to say, "I told you so."

379
00:26:17,451 --> 00:26:20,788
- That's it.
- But I think he's behaving in a good way.

380
00:26:20,788 --> 00:26:24,292
- I think he's the most consistent...
- Sensible.

381
00:26:24,292 --> 00:26:26,544
I think he doesn't want her anymore.

382
00:26:27,044 --> 00:26:30,673
Do you know why?
Because when you're seeing somebody...

383
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:32,216
Hear my wise words.

384
00:26:32,216 --> 00:26:33,592
When you're...

385
00:26:35,011 --> 00:26:38,723
When you're seeing somebody,

386
00:26:38,723 --> 00:26:41,475
you analyze the behavior...

387
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:45,646
to see if it's possible to have
a future relationship with that person.

388
00:26:45,646 --> 00:26:50,192
He's already seen it, he's like...
I'm sure he thinks, "I'm seeing this girl,

389
00:26:50,192 --> 00:26:51,402
and she does that.

390
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:54,864
Imagine if I had a real relationship...
What else would she do?"

391
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:58,868
Guys, she wants Ramon pretty bad.
She called Mauro because of Ramon.

392
00:26:58,868 --> 00:27:01,662
If you were Ramon,
would you give her a chance?

393
00:27:01,662 --> 00:27:03,789
- I wouldn't!
- I'd call the cops.

394
00:27:03,789 --> 00:27:05,082
She plays dirty, right?

395
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:06,792
She's low, girl.

396
00:27:06,792 --> 00:27:08,044
No, she's mean.

397
00:27:08,044 --> 00:27:10,212
She said she was going to leave, right?

398
00:27:10,212 --> 00:27:12,465
She said she was going to pack.

399
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:16,010
- I'm going... to bed.
- Baby, who's Amanda?

400
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:18,721
Everybody judged Amanda.
Who's Amanda compared to her?

401
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:21,098
- Amanda was nice in the house.
- Amanda's honest.

402
00:27:21,098 --> 00:27:22,391
She doesn't play dirty.

403
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,101
Amanda, friends with Tay.

404
00:27:24,101 --> 00:27:25,811
The vegan friend...

405
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:28,731
At least she said what she wanted.

406
00:27:28,731 --> 00:27:30,858
- Shame.
- Look at the fight.

407
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,877
- You and Nath didn't hook up yesterday?
- No.

408
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:50,920
Not even a kiss?

409
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,589
It's not going to happen again,
I'm telling you.

410
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:55,257
It's not going to happen.

411
00:27:55,841 --> 00:27:58,552
- It's not going to happen?
- No...

412
00:27:58,552 --> 00:28:00,721
What you're gonna do? Party with me?

413
00:28:00,721 --> 00:28:02,264
I am.

414
00:28:03,265 --> 00:28:07,645
I'm going to party, my way. Yesterday
I danced when I wanted, I partied...

415
00:28:07,645 --> 00:28:09,063
Last night was cool.

416
00:28:09,063 --> 00:28:10,606
No pressure, nothing.

417
00:28:10,606 --> 00:28:12,817
You danced a lot, right, baby?

418
00:28:12,817 --> 00:28:16,153
You two put on a show on the dance floor.

419
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:20,658
- Tay's situation...
- You were born to funk dance.

420
00:28:31,877 --> 00:28:35,172
Are we going to cook more potato
so as not to leave this here?

421
00:28:35,172 --> 00:28:36,382
I think it's worth it.

422
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:37,550
I'm going to remove...

423
00:28:37,550 --> 00:28:38,801
The potato?

424
00:28:38,801 --> 00:28:40,302
Just a little is enough.

425
00:28:40,302 --> 00:28:42,012
- I have the oil here.
- Give it to me.

426
00:28:42,847 --> 00:28:43,931
Take it.

427
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,393
Oh, fuck.

428
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:51,689
The son of a gun is calling.

429
00:28:52,148 --> 00:28:53,899
- There he goes.
- Hey, my friend!

430
00:28:55,901 --> 00:28:57,987
- What's up, Ricardo?
- We jinxed it.

431
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:00,781
- Ricardo?
- Go to the porch.

432
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:03,909
Hey, my man.

433
00:29:03,909 --> 00:29:07,580
It's Murilo, how are you?
Do you recognize my voice? Tell the truth.

434
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:11,584
How was the boat ride?

435
00:29:11,584 --> 00:29:14,420
Man, it was rad. Thanks, you know?
For the boat...

436
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,547
If it wasn't for you,
we wouldn't have taken a ride.

437
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:19,008
Thanks a lot.

438
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:22,303
Today, the four boys are coming over
to help me.

439
00:29:22,303 --> 00:29:23,387
Cool.

440
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:25,473
I'm waiting for you guys.

441
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:27,475
Cool. Take care. Later.

442
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:29,894
Take care.

443
00:29:30,603 --> 00:29:32,021
Things just got better.

444
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:33,189
The four boys.

445
00:29:33,189 --> 00:29:34,899
The four of us?

446
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:35,941
Good.

447
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:39,028
- Again?
- Let's get to work, right?

448
00:30:01,842 --> 00:30:03,886
Madness inside the bus

449
00:30:03,886 --> 00:30:06,972
That beautiful moment we had

450
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:09,558
What do you think about going
funk dancing tonight?

451
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,685
- What?
- That's fair.

452
00:30:11,685 --> 00:30:13,395
- Funk dancing is never bad.
- Girls only.

453
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:14,855
What?

454
00:30:15,481 --> 00:30:16,649
What?

455
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,207
Guys, the bus is here.

456
00:30:33,207 --> 00:30:34,667
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

457
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:36,377
Should we take a picture beforehand?

458
00:30:36,377 --> 00:30:40,005
Let's put the picture on the fridge
with a note for the boys.

459
00:30:40,005 --> 00:30:41,340
- Let's do it.
- Good.

460
00:30:44,385 --> 00:30:48,055
This one goes a little more
in the back, right?

461
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:54,520
We went to the funk party

462
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:57,940
Let's go.

463
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,525
- Let's go?
- Let's go.

464
00:30:59,525 --> 00:31:01,277
Tonight is the night.

465
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:03,028
Let's go party!

466
00:31:04,572 --> 00:31:06,156
We're going to shake our asses.

467
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:08,659
To shake the big ass...
The big ass God gave us.

468
00:31:10,411 --> 00:31:11,954
Mine is not that big.

469
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:14,999
Mine is a little flat.

470
00:31:15,708 --> 00:31:16,792
But you have it.

471
00:31:42,943 --> 00:31:44,445
Wow, the flashing drink.

472
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,656
Pour some for me again.

473
00:31:52,244 --> 00:31:53,746
One for all.

474
00:31:53,871 --> 00:31:55,164
All for one!

475
00:31:55,164 --> 00:31:56,957
One for all, all for one!

476
00:32:13,891 --> 00:32:17,436
I hope we have a magical night.

477
00:32:17,436 --> 00:32:19,021
Us for us. Always!

478
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:20,689
Always!

479
00:32:44,421 --> 00:32:46,757
For those who've never been a waiter...

480
00:32:47,383 --> 00:32:48,509
Tell me,

481
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:49,843
is it the coolest beer?

482
00:32:49,843 --> 00:32:51,303
The best we have.

483
00:32:53,222 --> 00:32:54,556
Come on, it was at the end.

484
00:32:54,556 --> 00:32:55,891
There should be tequila.

485
00:32:55,891 --> 00:32:59,937
I wanted it, too.
You have to talk to our manager, Ricardo.

486
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:01,438
There should be tequila for you.

487
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:04,566
- For you.
- If we drink tequila, baby...

488
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,984
Yeah?

489
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:11,448
I'm scared, I'm scared of you.

490
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:15,577
Tequila for everybody here, fuck.

491
00:33:15,577 --> 00:33:17,746
Now I want to see... the four of you.

492
00:33:18,914 --> 00:33:20,916
I'm going to leave for a while.

493
00:33:20,916 --> 00:33:22,960
I have some serious business to deal with.

494
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,087
- You're responsible for the bar.
- Deal.

495
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:26,296
- I trust you.
- Deal.

496
00:33:26,296 --> 00:33:27,297
Thanks for trusting me.

497
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:28,799
- You got it?
- Sure.

498
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:30,467
Do I need to do anything?

499
00:33:30,926 --> 00:33:33,220
- Ramon, you already know the job.
- Deal.

500
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,432
So... Teach them.
I trust you. Don't let me down.

501
00:33:36,432 --> 00:33:37,683
I got it. Be cool.

502
00:33:37,683 --> 00:33:39,309
- It's okay. Deal.
- Thanks.

503
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:41,061
Good evening.

504
00:33:41,061 --> 00:33:42,438
Listen to this.

505
00:33:42,438 --> 00:33:43,897
The boss had to leave

506
00:33:43,897 --> 00:33:47,192
and left me in charge while he's away.

507
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:49,319
Here's the thing, you're going to work,

508
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:51,280
and I'll enjoy a little while he's out.

509
00:33:51,280 --> 00:33:53,490
- Okay? Deal?
- Deal. You're such a carioca.

510
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:56,326
It had to be you, right, punk?

511
00:33:56,326 --> 00:33:59,705
If you're not doing anything,
let me take over this...

512
00:33:59,705 --> 00:34:00,789
I'm going to enjoy.

513
00:34:02,499 --> 00:34:04,293
Just a minute.

514
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:07,129
The boss had to leave
and left me in charge.

515
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:11,425
Luanzinho, what did you ask me
just a while ago?

516
00:34:11,425 --> 00:34:14,136
- We want shots!
- Do you want shots?

517
00:34:14,136 --> 00:34:16,972
I want to hear it, who wants shots?

518
00:34:16,972 --> 00:34:19,683
I can't hear you.
Raise your hands, everybody up.

519
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:21,643
Shot! Shot!

520
00:34:22,144 --> 00:34:25,063
Then, shots for fucking everybody.

521
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,900
Luan, bring shots for everybody.
I'm fucking in charge.

522
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,693
Let's go!

523
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:31,779
Come, come. Didn't you want shots?

524
00:34:31,779 --> 00:34:33,781
At last, you did something right, carioca.

525
00:34:36,366 --> 00:34:38,160
Come, we have shots for everybody.

526
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:41,830
Not too much.

527
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:46,084
You're going to drink it too...

528
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:47,878
I'm going to get in line again.

529
00:34:47,878 --> 00:34:49,922
Can't I drink just one more?

530
00:34:49,922 --> 00:34:51,215
Next!

531
00:34:51,215 --> 00:34:53,091
This is the Brazil I want, huh?

532
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:56,970
Hold it, don't swallow it.

533
00:34:58,388 --> 00:34:59,807
Hold it in your mouth.

534
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:01,642
Swallow it!

535
00:35:04,353 --> 00:35:05,979
Now, here, look!

536
00:35:07,356 --> 00:35:08,607
It should've been on the mouth.

537
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,278
Give me a tequila kiss.

538
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:19,076
Nobody told you to drink tequila.

539
00:35:19,076 --> 00:35:21,411
Tequila ruins people's lives.

540
00:35:22,371 --> 00:35:24,456
You're going to be shot.

541
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:25,833
Don't you want it? Here.

542
00:35:25,833 --> 00:35:27,835
- Bring me a drink?
- What do you want?

543
00:35:27,835 --> 00:35:29,878
- You can bring me an Aperol.
- Okay.

544
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,883
Okay. I'm going to get you one.

545
00:35:34,883 --> 00:35:35,884
Yeah?

546
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:38,220
Yeah.

547
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,525
Yeah, what?

548
00:35:51,525 --> 00:35:54,278
I don't want it. I'm cool.
Let me tell you something.

549
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:55,946
Come here, in the corner.

550
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:58,073
If you gave shots to everybody in the bar,

551
00:35:58,073 --> 00:35:59,616
we're so fucked.

552
00:36:03,704 --> 00:36:04,872
Good, man.

553
00:36:06,915 --> 00:36:08,750
Give this cap to him later.

554
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,336
You can celebrate,
but tonight, we're screwed.

555
00:36:17,885 --> 00:36:19,261
Now we're fucked.

556
00:36:27,686 --> 00:36:29,313
I have some notes for you.

557
00:36:29,313 --> 00:36:31,648
First, I want to thank you for the effort.

558
00:36:31,648 --> 00:36:33,650
The bar got happier, great.

559
00:36:33,650 --> 00:36:36,278
I'm gonna let you go earlier
so you can enjoy.

560
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:37,613
Okay?

561
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:39,781
That's not all.

562
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:42,492
There are two things. One,

563
00:36:42,492 --> 00:36:45,621
the boat ride is expensive, I told you.

564
00:36:45,621 --> 00:36:48,248
You're not only paying for this tonight.

565
00:36:48,248 --> 00:36:49,291
- Okay?
- Sure.

566
00:36:49,291 --> 00:36:51,793
I'm having a party at the bar...

567
00:36:52,586 --> 00:36:54,463
Are you seeing this crowd?

568
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:56,715
I want to double it.
You're going to promote

569
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:58,508
- this party I'm throwing here.
- Great.

570
00:36:58,508 --> 00:37:01,053
- We got it.
- Ask the girls for some help.

571
00:37:01,053 --> 00:37:03,055
I'll invite the whole island here.

572
00:37:03,055 --> 00:37:04,514
- Deal, deal.
- Cool?

573
00:37:04,514 --> 00:37:05,599
When is it?

574
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,351
- I'll let you know.
- Okay, deal.

575
00:37:07,351 --> 00:37:08,268
- Cool?
- Cool.

576
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:09,394
We can tell people now.

577
00:37:09,394 --> 00:37:10,771
Is this going to be wild?

578
00:37:10,771 --> 00:37:16,401
The wildest... Now you can go enjoy
the place because you cheered up the bar.

579
00:37:16,401 --> 00:37:17,361
Thanks.

580
00:37:17,361 --> 00:37:20,322
At the end, we'll cash out
and see how the situation is.

581
00:37:20,322 --> 00:37:21,323
Sure.

582
00:37:21,323 --> 00:37:24,826
But, for now, I trust you guys.
That's it, gang. Thanks.

583
00:37:24,826 --> 00:37:25,911
Thanks, Ricardo.

584
00:37:25,911 --> 00:37:27,371
Thanks, brother.

585
00:37:27,371 --> 00:37:28,705
Sex on the Beach.

586
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:30,207
I'll finish it.

587
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,000
This is the gin.

588
00:37:34,002 --> 00:37:35,796
I thought I was going to be scolded.

589
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:38,924
Punk... You're a punk.

590
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,851
Let's go.

591
00:37:49,851 --> 00:37:51,061
Thanks.

592
00:37:51,061 --> 00:37:51,979
Let's go.

593
00:37:51,979 --> 00:37:53,438
I'm João Vitor.

594
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:55,023
You said you were going to kiss her.

595
00:37:55,399 --> 00:37:56,525
Whoa.

596
00:37:57,401 --> 00:37:59,277
You didn't give me tequila anymore.

597
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:02,948
You didn't give it to me.

598
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:22,092
If it isn't like this, it ain't happening.

599
00:38:22,092 --> 00:38:23,760
Not sure if I'll show Rio to you.

600
00:38:24,261 --> 00:38:25,721
I'd rather stay and fuck you.

601
00:38:27,305 --> 00:38:28,390
No.

602
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:30,809
Then find time to know Rio and fuck me.

603
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,394
I want to know Rio, too.

604
00:38:32,394 --> 00:38:34,146
- Yeah? You want to know it?
- Sure.

605
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:36,565
I'll show you around.

606
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,692
My room is great.

607
00:38:56,877 --> 00:38:58,253
It's time, huh?

608
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:01,048
Who's coming?

609
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:05,135
Let's go! Let's go!

610
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:07,679
Good evening for those who date.

611
00:39:07,679 --> 00:39:10,265
We're waiting for you at our party, huh?

612
00:39:10,265 --> 00:39:11,850
Let's go home.

613
00:39:19,066 --> 00:39:20,275
Come on, Blondie.

614
00:39:23,153 --> 00:39:24,529
Jesus.

615
00:39:41,505 --> 00:39:44,925
MOMMIES
ARE HERE

616
00:39:57,020 --> 00:39:59,940
Girl, what do you think
the boys are doing back home?

617
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:03,902
I think they're not giving
a fuck about us, and we're doing the same.

618
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:05,987
We came here to party.

619
00:40:05,987 --> 00:40:07,405
Nobody needs men to be happy.

620
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:10,575
That's it. No, girl...
Seriously, we party...

621
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:14,121
That's the best party I've ever been to,
with the four of us.

622
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:17,666
I don't want to worry about anybody.

623
00:40:17,666 --> 00:40:21,044
I don't want to worry about
what you're going to do.

624
00:40:21,044 --> 00:40:22,712
I like to see you like this.

625
00:40:22,712 --> 00:40:25,465
Beautiful and drunk,
falling on the ground.

626
00:40:25,465 --> 00:40:26,716
Not so much.

627
00:40:26,716 --> 00:40:28,927
But... I'm very drunk.

628
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:51,324
Fuck.

629
00:40:51,324 --> 00:40:55,036
Rain!

630
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,464
Man, don't fall.

631
00:41:08,383 --> 00:41:12,429
Luan, I have terrible news for you.

632
00:41:12,429 --> 00:41:13,513
There's no food.

633
00:41:13,513 --> 00:41:15,640
There is always food. Champagne?

634
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,143
I want to give... this to Luan.

635
00:41:18,143 --> 00:41:20,395
"We went to the funk party."

636
00:41:20,395 --> 00:41:21,605
Ouch!

637
00:41:22,230 --> 00:41:24,316
They went to the funk party.

638
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:25,233
No one's here.

639
00:41:25,233 --> 00:41:27,944
Do you know if they have more than us?

640
00:41:27,944 --> 00:41:32,115
I'm going to raise a toast
with this champagne. This goes for you...

641
00:41:32,991 --> 00:41:34,284
And for Murilão.

642
00:41:38,955 --> 00:41:41,124
You're the first one to have a sip.

643
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:45,337
Welcome! You, too, come.

644
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:57,474
Is all of it those girls' fault?
Not coming home?

645
00:41:57,474 --> 00:42:01,019
They'll be really wasted.
I wonder what's happening there.

646
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:02,479
No...

647
00:42:05,232 --> 00:42:07,943
Bro, they went to a funk party, VIP area,

648
00:42:07,943 --> 00:42:10,237
with a bunch of men dancing all over them.

649
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:15,200
Look at this, bro.

650
00:42:15,951 --> 00:42:17,953
We'll see.

651
00:42:18,662 --> 00:42:20,121
Look,

652
00:42:20,121 --> 00:42:21,748
if I were you,

653
00:42:21,748 --> 00:42:23,541
I wouldn't get ahead of myself.

654
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:25,293
I'm cool, bro. Are you insane?

655
00:42:25,293 --> 00:42:26,461
There's nothing to say.

656
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:28,255
Luan is the one who's mad.

657
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:30,966
Not at them.

658
00:42:32,259 --> 00:42:34,261
Because we didn't go, man.

659
00:43:01,329 --> 00:43:03,373
Bruna?

660
00:43:05,041 --> 00:43:06,793
She doesn't care...

661
00:43:06,793 --> 00:43:08,628
Kiss him, baby!

662
00:43:08,628 --> 00:43:10,088
What time are you leaving?

663
00:43:10,088 --> 00:43:12,048
Are you going to spend the night?

664
00:43:12,048 --> 00:43:13,508
Girl, are you leaving?

665
00:43:14,426 --> 00:43:16,344
See you later...

666
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:36,990
One step at a time.

667
00:43:45,874 --> 00:43:47,751
- Don't.
- I'm with someone here.

668
00:43:48,335 --> 00:43:49,461
Do you want help?

669
00:43:49,461 --> 00:43:52,130
Look how she's doing the dishes.

670
00:43:52,130 --> 00:43:53,631
Girl, it's my heel.

671
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,216
- Forget the shoes.
- What?

672
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:57,177
Did you go to a party?

673
00:44:00,263 --> 00:44:01,473
Have some champagne...

674
00:44:03,266 --> 00:44:04,934
Jeez, this heel... There.

675
00:44:05,894 --> 00:44:09,022
And I'm deluding myself...

676
00:44:09,022 --> 00:44:12,067
She's the best...
Wonderful, guys. Girls...

677
00:44:12,067 --> 00:44:15,987
- I'm in, too.
- We already visited the lions' room...

678
00:44:17,072 --> 00:44:17,989
How was the night?

679
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:21,951
And I'm deluding...

680
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:25,705
And I'm deluding myself...

681
00:44:25,705 --> 00:44:28,375
I want a kiss from my baby.

682
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:34,089
And I'm deluding...

683
00:44:35,924 --> 00:44:37,133
Milu

684
00:44:37,801 --> 00:44:39,427
Girl,

685
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:41,930
Ramon is with somebody, easy.

686
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:47,477
Murilo isn't with somebody, right?

687
00:44:48,103 --> 00:44:50,605
Damn, I would be crying a lot right now.

688
00:44:51,398 --> 00:44:52,732
Good.

689
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:55,026
You really love me.

690
00:44:55,777 --> 00:44:56,945
Look.

691
00:45:00,949 --> 00:45:02,200
Do you...

692
00:45:08,123 --> 00:45:10,834
Put your hand on my chest.
I think I'm feeling bad.

693
00:45:11,751 --> 00:45:13,420
Are you sleeping on my bed?

694
00:45:14,796 --> 00:45:16,089
Oh, no!

695
00:45:16,089 --> 00:45:17,757
That's messed up.

696
00:45:19,676 --> 00:45:21,136
At least let me see your face.

697
00:45:23,096 --> 00:45:25,306
You're sleeping on my bed.

698
00:45:25,306 --> 00:45:26,474
Beatriz.

699
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:29,227
Get out of here... Out.

700
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:31,354
You're sleeping on my bed!

701
00:45:31,855 --> 00:45:33,440
You're imagining things, Nathalia.

702
00:45:33,982 --> 00:45:35,567
You're imagining things.

703
00:45:35,567 --> 00:45:37,861
I'm not imagining things.

704
00:45:38,695 --> 00:45:40,530
Slap your own face.

705
00:46:07,932 --> 00:46:09,100
I can't believe...

706
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:10,852
Jeez, man.

707
00:46:10,852 --> 00:46:13,354
Jeez, that chick is clueless, man.

708
00:46:13,354 --> 00:46:16,191
I'm shocked with Nathalia's attitude.

709
00:46:16,191 --> 00:46:18,526
Nathalia is totally insane.

710
00:46:18,526 --> 00:46:21,821
Seeing what she's done,

711
00:46:21,821 --> 00:46:26,701
I understand that she has a feeling
and doesn't know how to deal with it.

712
00:46:27,076 --> 00:46:28,703
Since the beginning.

713
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:31,456
It would be one thing if she was crazy.

714
00:46:31,456 --> 00:46:33,041
She has no feelings at all.

715
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:34,250
You think?

716
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:37,587
He was playing because he said
he loved her one day

717
00:46:37,587 --> 00:46:39,422
and the other day he did that.

718
00:46:40,089 --> 00:46:41,799
- But...
- This is worse.

719
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,719
She was thinking she was

720
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:47,555
- full of herself.
- Do you think he's playing, too?

721
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:49,349
He doesn't have
any feelings for her.

722
00:46:49,349 --> 00:46:51,518
Do men play hard to get with you?

723
00:46:51,518 --> 00:46:52,727
Many men do it with me.

724
00:46:52,727 --> 00:46:57,023
Jeez, I say, "Look, baby,
I'm not gonna play this game."

725
00:46:57,023 --> 00:46:59,609
I don't like it.
Don't do this to me, I'll go crazy.

726
00:46:59,609 --> 00:47:01,277
Nice to meet you, I like games.

727
00:47:01,277 --> 00:47:04,113
The other day I was out with my friends...

728
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:05,532
Then you felt like fucking.

729
00:47:05,532 --> 00:47:08,910
Everybody was talking, a woman
showed up and said, "I want to fuck."

730
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:11,412
Stop it. Where were you...
What is this place?

731
00:47:11,996 --> 00:47:14,999
- I mean it.
- Some place.

732
00:47:14,999 --> 00:47:18,086
I mean it. 3:00 a.m.

733
00:47:18,086 --> 00:47:20,797
"I'm doing nothing here,
anybody want to fuck me?"

734
00:47:20,797 --> 00:47:22,215
Are you out at 3:00 a.m.?

735
00:47:22,215 --> 00:47:24,884
I'm still waking up at 3:00 a.m.

736
00:47:24,884 --> 00:47:28,429
That woman showed up at the taxi stand
and said, "I want to fuck."

737
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:31,015
This way, anybody does it, right.

738
00:47:31,015 --> 00:47:34,686
She showed up, there were 20 people,
and said, "I want to fuck."

739
00:47:34,686 --> 00:47:37,564
- So, the first to get up fucked her?
- No, three got up.

740
00:47:37,564 --> 00:47:40,650
I'm going to the streets saying,
"Who wants to pay my bills?"

741
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:42,986
I think it's much more difficult for men.

742
00:47:42,986 --> 00:47:45,822
It's already difficult for men to kiss,
but to fuck...

743
00:47:45,822 --> 00:47:47,574
"Today I'm going to fuck."

744
00:47:47,574 --> 00:47:50,118
It's more complicated.
It requires a lot of talk.

745
00:47:50,118 --> 00:47:52,537
You have to do this...

746
00:47:52,537 --> 00:47:56,332
I'm going to show up on your street
and say, "Who wants to pay my bill?

747
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:58,835
Who wants to pay my credit card?"

748
00:47:58,835 --> 00:48:01,754
Who do you think is enjoying
that house the most?

749
00:48:02,297 --> 00:48:03,590
- João, man.
- Blondie.

750
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:06,217
- It's Blondie.
- Do you think it's João?

751
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:09,095
Blondie doesn't fight.
She doesn't care about anything.

752
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:10,972
Blondie is wonderful.

753
00:48:10,972 --> 00:48:12,223
It's Blondie and João.

754
00:48:12,223 --> 00:48:14,767
After João had sex, he went nuts, guys.

755
00:48:14,767 --> 00:48:18,104
He enjoys the parties the most.
He hooks up with more girls.

756
00:48:18,104 --> 00:48:20,648
He's the one enjoying the most.

757
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:22,317
He has no reason to fight.

758
00:48:22,317 --> 00:48:26,404
I'd be like João, but not...
I wouldn't be friends with anybody.

759
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:29,824
I'd hook up with one boy,
hook up with another.

760
00:48:30,199 --> 00:48:33,494
I'd wake up, have breakfast,
hook up with another boy.

761
00:48:33,494 --> 00:48:35,413
Man, João is like this, right?

762
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:37,582
He's not hooking up with anybody
from the house.

763
00:48:37,582 --> 00:48:40,585
But if you hook up with a boy
who was somebody else's,

764
00:48:40,585 --> 00:48:42,503
the chicks would fight you.

765
00:48:42,503 --> 00:48:47,383
They'd follow me.
Everybody would hook up with each other.

766
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:49,719
- Who would you be in the house?
- João.

767
00:48:51,346 --> 00:48:53,306
I'd be Tay. What about you?

768
00:48:53,306 --> 00:48:54,390
Tay?

769
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:58,227
I think I'd be... Taynara and Murilo.

770
00:48:58,227 --> 00:49:00,480
Man, Murilo is awesome. I'd be into him.

771
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:02,148
I like relationships with fights.

772
00:49:02,148 --> 00:49:03,691
No, I wouldn't be into him.

773
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:05,026
Who would you be?

774
00:49:05,026 --> 00:49:06,069
I wouldn't be.

775
00:49:06,069 --> 00:49:07,862
Choose one. Everybody did.

776
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:10,990
- Blondie.
- Blondie? She doesn't hook up with anyone.

777
00:49:10,990 --> 00:49:13,785
She does whatever she wants, she's cool.

778
00:49:13,785 --> 00:49:14,994
Would you kiss someone there?

779
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:17,580
- On the mouth.
- Which one did you like the most?

780
00:49:18,331 --> 00:49:21,876
Man, in the beginning I liked João,
but I don't like men like that...

781
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:23,419
What he showed himself to be.

782
00:49:23,419 --> 00:49:24,754
I like discreet men.

783
00:49:24,754 --> 00:49:26,047
That's true.

784
00:49:26,047 --> 00:49:28,966
I think Murilo seems to be more...

785
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,802
The manager?

786
00:49:30,802 --> 00:49:32,387
The manager is so serious.

787
00:49:32,387 --> 00:49:34,931
That's true, the manager is super serious.

788
00:49:34,931 --> 00:49:37,392
Where would you hook up with him
in that house?

789
00:49:38,142 --> 00:49:40,561
- In the bathroom.
- I would do it in the pool.

790
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:42,397
I'd only do it in the bathroom, too.

791
00:49:42,397 --> 00:49:45,108
Press play, for Christ's sake.

792
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:46,818
ON THE NEXT EPISODE

793
00:49:46,818 --> 00:49:50,822
I'll put Tay against the wall
and shake on her ass.

794
00:49:52,865 --> 00:49:56,411
I respected your girl a lot, you prick.

795
00:49:56,411 --> 00:49:57,578
Do you want to show off?

796
00:49:58,287 --> 00:50:01,374
- Easy, man.
- Who do you think you are, brother?

797
00:50:01,374 --> 00:50:02,500
They'll kill him.

798
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,085
What happened, bro? Go.

799
00:50:04,085 --> 00:50:06,754
You don't need this.
I'm going to have to kill you.

800
00:50:08,256 --> 00:50:09,841
Guys, this show is crazy.

801
00:50:10,383 --> 00:50:12,260
- I'm shocked.
- Man...

802
00:50:12,260 --> 00:50:14,095
Looks like somebody rubbed up against Bia.

803
00:50:14,095 --> 00:50:18,766
I think Carol taught them how to rub up.
People did it and it caused trouble.

804
00:50:18,766 --> 00:50:21,060
I'm shocked
because there was a real fight.

805
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,938
Guys, one episode ends well,
the next one...

806
00:50:23,938 --> 00:50:27,483
Girl, I told you that bus is something.

807
00:50:27,483 --> 00:50:28,568
That bus is something.

808
00:50:28,568 --> 00:50:31,988
Amazon Prime Video,
please, bless that bus.

809
00:50:31,988 --> 00:50:33,197
That's true.

810
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:34,574
Now,

811
00:50:34,574 --> 00:50:38,327
Luan, after that fight,
you can come out. We're waiting.

812
00:50:38,327 --> 00:50:40,872
I'm shocked... Let me tell you something.

813
00:50:40,872 --> 00:50:43,249
Set the alarm
because I want to see everybody here.

814
00:50:43,249 --> 00:50:45,877
I'm shocked with those fights, you know?

815
00:50:45,877 --> 00:50:48,129
I need to take a rosemary
and honey bath to...

816
00:50:48,129 --> 00:50:49,630
How can we wait one week?

817
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:51,674
How can we wait one week to watch this?

818
00:50:51,674 --> 00:50:54,343
- Let's make a group on the app?
- Guys, I'm shocked.

819
00:50:54,343 --> 00:50:57,346
One group on WhatsApp
to talk about Wild and Free...

820
00:50:57,346 --> 00:50:59,223
I'm very anxious.
What happened?

821
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:01,601
- Guys, that's crazy.
- But we'll find out

822
00:51:01,601 --> 00:51:02,852
on the next episode, right?

823
00:51:02,852 --> 00:51:05,271
Take care, it was great being with you.

824
00:51:05,271 --> 00:51:07,231
- Bye, see you.
- My car from the app.

825
00:51:07,231 --> 00:51:09,108
Can we take this cake home?
