WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS
THE REVIEW

2
00:00:20,479 --> 00:00:22,815
We've been invited by Amazon Prime Video

3
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:26,819
to watch the first episode of the new
series Wild and Free: Florianópolis.

4
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:30,197
All we know is they're not actors
and there's no script.

5
00:00:30,197 --> 00:00:32,658
It's all for real.
We'll have to check that out.

6
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:39,707
- Hi, Ramon.
- Dancing every day, right?

7
00:00:39,707 --> 00:00:42,209
Hi, Ramon, how are you? What's up, Tay?

8
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:47,715
- Is that your man?
- João is my crush.

9
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:49,633
That one? I like João, too.

10
00:00:54,930 --> 00:00:57,475
- I like Thais.
- Looks like a blogger.

11
00:00:59,018 --> 00:01:00,686
Hi, Luan, how are you?

12
00:01:00,686 --> 00:01:02,605
I felt different about Luan.

13
00:01:02,605 --> 00:01:04,190
I don't know what it is.

14
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:05,775
They call it "axé."

15
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:09,570
We all had this dream
of hitting the road with friends...

16
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,821
I've never done it.

17
00:01:10,946 --> 00:01:13,282
You've never done it? Too bad, honey.

18
00:01:13,282 --> 00:01:15,576
No, I'm kidding,
I've never done it either.

19
00:01:15,576 --> 00:01:16,952
A mad trip, baby.

20
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,330
Spoke with authority.

21
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,749
Yep, we pretend...
Just pretending to be happy.

22
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,626
Oh, my God! Look at that house.

23
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:25,461
They rented Daddy's house.

24
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,129
Of course we'd get into that.

25
00:01:27,129 --> 00:01:28,047
That's crazy.

26
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:30,174
Yeah, my home is an apartment.

27
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:32,426
It's a one-bedroom apartment.
Where's Amazon?

28
00:01:33,177 --> 00:01:36,013
- Guys, it's huge.
- My heart is beating faster.

29
00:01:36,013 --> 00:01:38,724
- Thick calf, I think it's a boy.
- Oh, girl.

30
00:01:38,724 --> 00:01:42,102
He has a vintage suitcase.
From the 18th century.

31
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:43,062
...made of cobblestone.

32
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:44,271
That would break the wheels.

33
00:01:44,271 --> 00:01:46,732
Where did you find it?

34
00:01:46,732 --> 00:01:49,068
- This is Jaguar João.
- Good. This is a jaguar.

35
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:50,027
This is Tarzan.

36
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:52,905
I don't like tattoos.
This tattoo was a mistake.

37
00:01:52,905 --> 00:01:53,948
I want a reality...

38
00:01:53,948 --> 00:01:56,826
The guy wants
to pretend he's the owner, right?

39
00:01:56,826 --> 00:01:58,828
Yeah... He thought he's the owner.

40
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:00,538
Honey...

41
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:02,832
They're not models, actors, they're not...

42
00:02:02,957 --> 00:02:04,750
They were thrown in there...

43
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:06,418
They must be from Floripa,

44
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:07,545
born beautiful...

45
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:09,296
- Crazy...
- Floripa is my dream.

46
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:11,715
They're already friends. Right?

47
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,050
They know each other from parties.

48
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:14,468
They know each other.

49
00:02:17,304 --> 00:02:19,306
What a gang!

50
00:02:19,306 --> 00:02:21,559
I think it's going to be three men.

51
00:02:21,559 --> 00:02:24,728
Brother, I saw you earlier.
That girl was really wild.

52
00:02:24,854 --> 00:02:27,690
His oblique muscles, guys.
Zoom in on that oblique.

53
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:29,567
The first two minutes of the series...

54
00:02:29,567 --> 00:02:31,777
Tarzan already banged Jane.

55
00:02:31,777 --> 00:02:32,695
It was a peck.

56
00:02:32,695 --> 00:02:34,238
I think they hooked up before.

57
00:02:34,238 --> 00:02:36,574
"How are you?"
Out of the blue... French kiss.

58
00:02:36,574 --> 00:02:37,950
I would come in like that.

59
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:38,909
Oh, sis.

60
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,536
You say hi with a French kiss?

61
00:02:40,536 --> 00:02:42,037
I think the personality...

62
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,706
When someone
has that kind of personality...

63
00:02:43,706 --> 00:02:44,665
Sure.

64
00:02:44,915 --> 00:02:47,167
- No, that's despair.
- I just go and kiss.

65
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:49,795
You gotta be like that, you know?
If you like someone, why not?

66
00:02:49,795 --> 00:02:51,213
If you like them...

67
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:52,464
I don't play games either.

68
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:54,550
How do you know
there's reciprocity?

69
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,844
You just say,
"Hey, how are you? How's it..."

70
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,053
If she jumped on his lap...

71
00:02:58,053 --> 00:02:59,722
They knew each other...

72
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:01,307
I guess they hooked up before.

73
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:03,809
Sometimes, just a look...
Tay is my favorite.

74
00:03:03,809 --> 00:03:05,311
I loved the way she came in...

75
00:03:05,311 --> 00:03:07,563
I think you have a lot
in common, you know?

76
00:03:07,563 --> 00:03:08,606
Yes, I can relate.

77
00:03:08,606 --> 00:03:10,190
I got something to say.

78
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:12,568
I think she's direct.
I like direct people.

79
00:03:12,568 --> 00:03:13,611
You're such a Don Juan!

80
00:03:13,611 --> 00:03:16,614
We have a couple in the house.

81
00:03:16,614 --> 00:03:17,948
The first couple!

82
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:23,954
Look at Luan. Look at his arm!
Yummy, Luan. Stick it all!

83
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:25,664
Here comes Luan.

84
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:29,793
- But João is better.
- I loved it, loved it.

85
00:03:29,793 --> 00:03:32,671
I imagine João asking my family's
permission to go on a date with me.

86
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:33,714
I was going to say that.

87
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,383
That house is insane, man.

88
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:38,177
That house is fucking awesome.

89
00:03:38,177 --> 00:03:41,138
It's very modern,
like a Toyota Land Cruiser bumper.

90
00:03:41,138 --> 00:03:43,557
- What?
- Like a Toyota Land Cruiser bumper.

91
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:44,934
Tay arrived hooking up with a guy.

92
00:03:44,934 --> 00:03:46,060
It's got to be like that.

93
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,561
I was going to say...

94
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:49,021
You'd cry on day one?

95
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:50,564
I'm very...

96
00:03:50,689 --> 00:03:52,733
Were you going to cry on the first day?

97
00:03:52,733 --> 00:03:54,109
If you drank, you would.

98
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:56,028
I was going to say, "I'm going to fuck."

99
00:03:56,028 --> 00:03:57,071
I'm very easy.

100
00:03:57,071 --> 00:03:59,031
I would sleep. I love sleeping.

101
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:00,783
Did you hear that? She'd arrive

102
00:04:00,783 --> 00:04:03,035
and do you know what she'd do?
She'd sleep.

103
00:04:03,035 --> 00:04:05,829
I would go to sleep.
I'd choose a room and...

104
00:04:06,205 --> 00:04:08,624
- Oh, girl.
- Holy cow.

105
00:04:08,624 --> 00:04:13,087
Everyone would say, "Carol, we're on
a reality show, let's go out and drink."

106
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:15,130
"No, just give me a chocolate milk."

107
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:17,049
Chocolate milk and a warm bed.

108
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:20,177
She's on a drip,
and the chocolate milk is falling.

109
00:04:21,845 --> 00:04:25,099
Blondie! Open your mouth.

110
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:27,726
They started to drink. Chug.
I'm going to chug it.

111
00:04:27,726 --> 00:04:30,062
Hey, that thing's just started,
you'll see.

112
00:04:30,062 --> 00:04:33,607
Guys, I'm going to take
a sip from my drink, I'm hot now.

113
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,067
Let's go to a club tonight?

114
00:04:35,067 --> 00:04:36,527
I have good...

115
00:04:36,527 --> 00:04:37,695
Good?

116
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:40,114
...and excellent news.

117
00:04:40,114 --> 00:04:41,949
You love me?

118
00:04:41,949 --> 00:04:44,493
I got us a VIP box at the Green Valley.

119
00:04:44,493 --> 00:04:46,787
I like his accent, it's like mine.

120
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:48,122
I love accents.

121
00:04:48,122 --> 00:04:50,791
I didn't know Mariano
was in that show, guys.

122
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:53,419
"I got us a box at the Green Valley."

123
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:55,921
Who's the one
that gets a box for the others?

124
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,798
At the Green Valley.

125
00:04:57,798 --> 00:04:59,008
I'm the one who asks.

126
00:04:59,008 --> 00:05:00,175
She's got a lot of connections.

127
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:01,427
If Bianca and Carol joined forces,

128
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:02,553
it will be the box and the whole party.

129
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:04,013
Carol gets the box.

130
00:05:04,013 --> 00:05:06,515
Carol, you're the best, huh, girl?

131
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:07,975
I get the drinks.
I get the combos.

132
00:05:07,975 --> 00:05:11,729
Carol, the bus and I, behind.
The bus and I go in.

133
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:15,941
He took the shirt off! Take the pants off.

134
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:17,735
I think he's a show-off.

135
00:05:17,735 --> 00:05:18,736
What does it mean?

136
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:19,987
He likes to attract attention...

137
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:21,822
When you want to get attention...

138
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:23,699
He wants to be noticed.

139
00:05:23,699 --> 00:05:25,451
That girl is over there...

140
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:27,453
this guy takes his shirt off. Big mistake.

141
00:05:27,453 --> 00:05:28,996
I'm not even listening...

142
00:05:28,996 --> 00:05:31,749
Putting the...
Oh, my God, that's all right.

143
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:34,585
First little kiss in the house.

144
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,463
It's red lipstick!

145
00:05:38,297 --> 00:05:40,257
It shouldn't be
a movie kiss, you know?

146
00:05:40,549 --> 00:05:42,634
I think we should do the same.

147
00:05:44,553 --> 00:05:45,512
So go to the party.

148
00:05:45,512 --> 00:05:47,598
Oh, my God!

149
00:05:47,598 --> 00:05:49,516
- Murilo!
- Crap, little smooch?

150
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:52,186
I won't judge. I did that recently.

151
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:54,104
- I'm not going to judge.
- I enjoyed that at Rock in Rio.

152
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:56,648
If she was wearing Boca Rosa lipstick,

153
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:57,858
it wouldn't come off.

154
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:59,693
Lasts 24 hours and it's waterproof.

155
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:00,736
Thanks, brother.

156
00:06:00,736 --> 00:06:02,988
Such a nice kiss!

157
00:06:02,988 --> 00:06:04,156
There's going to be more.

158
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:06,366
What did she say?

159
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:07,534
"There's going to be more later."

160
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:11,246
That guy is a show-off...

161
00:06:11,246 --> 00:06:13,082
I didn't like him. Neither did you.

162
00:06:13,082 --> 00:06:15,584
Take the guys to the shore...

163
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:19,004
No... Listen to Felipe Titto.

164
00:06:19,004 --> 00:06:21,215
I'd hook up
with Nathalia and João if I was there.

165
00:06:21,215 --> 00:06:22,883
- Would you hook up with Nathalia?
- I would.

166
00:06:22,883 --> 00:06:25,344
- Do you hook up with anyone?
- Aren't you gay?

167
00:06:25,344 --> 00:06:29,181
- Everyone is free. It's Floripa, no rules.
- Do you hook up with women?

168
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:30,682
Are you flexible?

169
00:06:30,682 --> 00:06:31,642
Freedom.

170
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:34,144
- Yes. It's a vast menu.
- Now, tell me something.

171
00:06:34,144 --> 00:06:35,896
That girl is always chewing.

172
00:06:35,896 --> 00:06:36,980
Yes... Exactly.

173
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,024
Will they wear makeup full-time?

174
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:40,442
He who doesn't go
on a diet eats everything.

175
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:41,944
She's free. There's no diet.

176
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:43,237
I think so, too.

177
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:47,407
There's a dressing table
for them to talk, to put on makeup.

178
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,701
- Holy crap, your jacket!
- I love it.

179
00:06:49,701 --> 00:06:52,329
- Pour it. Go. Put it all in.
- Pour it all!

180
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,872
I got a surprise for you guys.

181
00:06:54,373 --> 00:06:58,168
Just stay here, real quick.
Give me one sec.

182
00:06:58,168 --> 00:06:59,670
Come on, bus!

183
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,798
- It's here. Oh, boy!
- The bus.

184
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,049
The bus party.

185
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,343
The bus and us.
To go to the party.

186
00:07:06,343 --> 00:07:09,179
Looks like your mother is taking you
to your first party.

187
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:11,640
Yep, exactly, man. That's not good.

188
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,392
Have you partied in a bus?

189
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:14,518
I haven't even partied on foot.

190
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:16,228
Man, it's fucking awesome.

191
00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:17,396
But that is a room.

192
00:07:17,396 --> 00:07:19,314
You can walk and dance in the bus.

193
00:07:19,314 --> 00:07:21,608
I wouldn't fight
anyone in a party like that.

194
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:24,153
That beach over there
is like the one in São Gonçalo.

195
00:07:24,153 --> 00:07:27,739
What a mess.
They're all hooking up with each other.

196
00:07:27,739 --> 00:07:33,245
When they start bringing women
and men to that house, it's going to be...

197
00:07:33,245 --> 00:07:35,122
How is this going to work out?

198
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:36,999
Bringing men and women over there.

199
00:07:36,999 --> 00:07:38,458
They hooked up with each other a lot...

200
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:39,918
...those girls hook up
with other boys...

201
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,628
...with other girls?

202
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:42,880
That was a crazy party!

203
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,090
- Very good.
- Is it good?

204
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:47,134
It's salmon. Rich people thing.
Have some.

205
00:07:57,019 --> 00:08:00,105
João's hooking up with Thais.
Get out of there! I hate you!

206
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:02,774
Those guys brought a cake
to a birthday party.

207
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,027
That's right.

208
00:08:05,027 --> 00:08:07,613
That's it, now everyone
will start kissing. Let's kiss now.

209
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:10,032
What?

210
00:08:10,032 --> 00:08:12,701
Look, he hooked up with an unknown girl.

211
00:08:12,826 --> 00:08:14,161
Now he's calling another girl.

212
00:08:14,161 --> 00:08:15,245
What about that girl there?

213
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:19,333
- Look at her face.
- That's not necessary.

214
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,626
Didn't you say,
no strings attached?

215
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:21,752
Stop it right there.

216
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:23,462
We have the first betrayal.

217
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:24,963
He hooked up with one girl, then hooked up

218
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:26,715
with another in front of her?

219
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:27,758
Smoked a Derby.

220
00:08:27,758 --> 00:08:29,343
I have a problem with that.

221
00:08:29,343 --> 00:08:31,470
She even started smoking after that.

222
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:33,055
She'll begin to listen to modão and cry.

223
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:34,306
I don't like it like that.

224
00:08:34,431 --> 00:08:35,682
She'll listen to "Boate Azul".

225
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:37,976
If you want to be
part of a reality show...

226
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:39,978
...everyone will hook up with others.

227
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,194
- Hook up with boys, too.
- Get out of there, João!

228
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,654
They got pissed, look.

229
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:50,322
She's furious, opening her soda there.

230
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:52,115
Some boys don't come to talk to us.

231
00:08:52,115 --> 00:08:53,116
We have to approach them sometimes.

232
00:08:53,116 --> 00:08:54,117
João? Is it João?

233
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,078
João is fast.

234
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:57,621
João knows it all.

235
00:08:58,413 --> 00:08:59,790
If I were one of the girls,

236
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:03,210
I'd start hooking up
with other girls and other boys.

237
00:09:04,002 --> 00:09:05,587
- Now it's good.
- Look over there.

238
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:07,714
She's already crying! Crying on day one?

239
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:09,883
- She can't do that.
- I told you. Am I lying?

240
00:09:09,883 --> 00:09:12,636
- Is she really crying?
- Everyone is free.

241
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:14,721
- That's the booze.
- Kiss, girls. Kiss.

242
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,390
- It's booze.
- That's the booze.

243
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:18,558
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

244
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:20,435
- That's booze, not love.
- Two pretty girls.

245
00:09:20,435 --> 00:09:21,728
- It's booze.
- She didn't have time to love.

246
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:22,896
- Not love.
- It's not.

247
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:23,939
That's booze.

248
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:26,692
No way I would cry.
Look how many people is at the party.

249
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:28,235
Fuck, for Christ's sake!

250
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:31,071
I would get out of there
and you'd only see me next week.

251
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,197
She's in Floripa.

252
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:35,909
Afterparty at the house!

253
00:09:36,034 --> 00:09:37,577
Afterparty at the house!

254
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:39,246
That's great!

255
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:45,752
Now it's started.

256
00:09:45,752 --> 00:09:48,380
Thank God! Look at Taynara.

257
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:50,382
- Now we're talking!
- Look!

258
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:51,550
Look at Taynara.

259
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,677
Guys, she almost hit her head.

260
00:09:54,261 --> 00:09:56,013
Taynara is... Look at Taynara.

261
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:59,057
Man, I want Taynara.

262
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,267
And I want to see that bulge...

263
00:10:00,392 --> 00:10:01,601
Everyone wants you.

264
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:02,811
I'll tell you what...

265
00:10:02,811 --> 00:10:05,230
I wanna see the Speedos.

266
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,357
They're already taking a shower together?

267
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,526
That's quite a lunch box.

268
00:10:09,526 --> 00:10:10,610
What a gentleman.

269
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,322
If Taynara farts in a blowing horn,
bulls from all over would come.

270
00:10:13,322 --> 00:10:15,032
Wait.

271
00:10:16,366 --> 00:10:18,452
I saw Taynara first, stop it.

272
00:10:18,952 --> 00:10:20,037
Moaning.

273
00:10:20,037 --> 00:10:21,705
You see? You're wasting time.

274
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:24,291
It's a dog in heat.

275
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:27,502
Yep. Looked like a bunny
doing it really fast, like this, "Go."

276
00:10:27,502 --> 00:10:28,837
Like a trembling thing.

277
00:10:28,837 --> 00:10:30,130
I'm shocked, but I loved it.

278
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:32,341
I've never judged anyone having sex.

279
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:34,343
- I didn't.
- I've never seen it.

280
00:10:34,343 --> 00:10:35,719
I wanted to be like that
with my beau...

281
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:36,678
Damn it, man.

282
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:40,098
I've never seen this.
I've never seen anybody having sex...

283
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:41,141
What is that, guys?

284
00:10:41,141 --> 00:10:44,186
You gotta name it.
I love that position, on foot.

285
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,189
Would you stop
being loud over there, motherfuckers?

286
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,275
Murilo. João is already
cockblocking them upstairs.

287
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,777
I'd get a boy to fuck me, too.

288
00:10:51,777 --> 00:10:53,695
You think I'd be listening
to people fucking?

289
00:10:53,695 --> 00:10:55,072
You think it's easy?

290
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:57,324
I think this makes you do it, you know?

291
00:10:57,324 --> 00:10:59,076
If I see a friend
kissing someone at a party,

292
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:00,952
I feel like kissing
so I don't end up by myself.

293
00:11:01,078 --> 00:11:04,581
Yes. And if things
get really serious, I get really horny.

294
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:05,791
You think it's easy for me?

295
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:08,085
Chill, kid.

296
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:12,464
An eleven-inch cock and I don't...
No, go to hell, Luan.

297
00:11:12,464 --> 00:11:15,133
Cover up that dick, motherfucker.

298
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:16,593
He played.
Just warming up.

299
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:17,552
Look!

300
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,554
Do you want something better?

301
00:11:19,554 --> 00:11:21,431
Rewind and take a look at his shorts.

302
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,891
I'm going to rewind this.

303
00:11:22,891 --> 00:11:23,850
Wait.

304
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,144
Look at his shorts! Look at his shorts.

305
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:27,396
Fuck!

306
00:11:27,396 --> 00:11:28,897
No bullshit.

307
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:30,857
I'm nervous.

308
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:35,737
- Open the door! Open the little door!
- Man, how did you notice that?

309
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:37,697
I noticed it real quick.

310
00:11:38,615 --> 00:11:40,826
- You have bionic eyes.
- No one had noticed.

311
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:41,910
She has. Fast.

312
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:43,870
Titto looked at that girl's ass...

313
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,415
I didn't even notice that
he was in the room.

314
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:47,791
This way you see how a person...

315
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:51,044
- Nice, let's press play.
- Man, looks like a camera tripod.

316
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:52,087
Interesting.

317
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,719
I love the baked chicken position.

318
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,637
You love what?

319
00:12:00,637 --> 00:12:02,806
The baked chicken position. You like?

320
00:12:02,806 --> 00:12:05,350
It's Tay. I like it. I like it all.

321
00:12:07,144 --> 00:12:08,437
Guys, what is that?

322
00:12:08,437 --> 00:12:11,106
- Seriously, man? It's not possible.
- My God.

323
00:12:11,106 --> 00:12:14,192
- Guys, it's not possible.
- Guys, where's the infrared?

324
00:12:14,192 --> 00:12:16,111
I'm shocked. They are really liberal.

325
00:12:16,111 --> 00:12:18,822
- These people.
- Why am I like this? I'm shocked.

326
00:12:18,822 --> 00:12:21,199
Me, too. It's crazy. How...

327
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:24,828
- I'm shocked.
- If that girl's dad sees that...

328
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:27,038
Imagine my mother
seeing me doing the commentary.

329
00:12:27,038 --> 00:12:29,958
It's bad enough 'cause I'm doing this.
Can you imagine...

330
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,668
Mom, I don't do that.

331
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,670
Mom, I'm just commenting.

332
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:39,843
- Is it stroganoff?
- No. It's sushi, fuck.

333
00:12:39,843 --> 00:12:41,011
Idiot.

334
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:43,555
- Rude! Take the pillow...
- Stroganofferson.

335
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:46,850
Guys... Why does everyone
eat stroganoff after partying?

336
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:48,602
Because it's too easy to make.

337
00:12:48,727 --> 00:12:51,021
I'm still trying to get
the peanut off my tooth.

338
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:52,647
I'm like this... Look.

339
00:12:52,647 --> 00:12:56,234
Rinsing my mouth with Red Bull.
I'm rinsing my mouth

340
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:58,904
for two hours,
trying to get the peanut off my tooth.

341
00:13:00,405 --> 00:13:02,741
Do you need me to buy anything?
I could go out.

342
00:13:02,741 --> 00:13:03,867
We should think about
what we'll cook.

343
00:13:03,867 --> 00:13:05,869
Get stuff for a barbecue. And we're good.

344
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:07,412
- Garlic bread!
- Garlic bread!

345
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,247
Let's go get some garlic bread.

346
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:10,165
That's me.

347
00:13:10,165 --> 00:13:11,541
They're buying garlic bread.

348
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,377
People got excited
about garlic bread. Did you see it?

349
00:13:14,377 --> 00:13:17,047
Garlic bread is everything.
Who doesn't like it?

350
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:18,673
Let's buy garlic bread.

351
00:13:18,673 --> 00:13:20,217
That's delicious. It's food.

352
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:21,551
You're messing with me.

353
00:13:21,551 --> 00:13:23,678
All right, but do you have to get excited?

354
00:13:23,845 --> 00:13:24,679
Girl.

355
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:32,896
Taynara looks responsible.

356
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:35,190
They're the most beautiful girls there,

357
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,358
Taynara and Nathalia.

358
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:39,444
I like... Everyone is beautiful,
but I like their vibe.

359
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,363
I didn't say they're bad-looking.

360
00:13:41,363 --> 00:13:42,781
It was my opinion. Respect that.

361
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:44,491
It's my kind of girl.

362
00:13:44,491 --> 00:13:50,497
Look, my kind of boy, I wouldn't
hook up with... I don't know.

363
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:53,875
I'm going to tell you who
I'd hook up with, not who I wouldn't.

364
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:56,753
I'd hook up with Luan,
who was banging that chick.

365
00:13:56,753 --> 00:13:58,630
I like weird and funny guys.

366
00:13:58,630 --> 00:14:01,675
No... Taking a better look at João...

367
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:03,760
The man with the beard, I want him.

368
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:07,305
Did you hear that?
Then kiss me, you son of a bitch.

369
00:14:08,306 --> 00:14:09,849
Write it down, "Joyce."

370
00:14:13,687 --> 00:14:15,397
He's going to laugh so hard...

371
00:14:15,397 --> 00:14:16,690
He's going to get attached to this.

372
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,858
- You need to write...
- Joyce Kelly.

373
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:21,069
- Hold it up like this.
-"Joysse."

374
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:22,153
Now, "Kelly."

375
00:14:22,153 --> 00:14:24,155
He's not even
going to kiss Blondie anymore.

376
00:14:24,155 --> 00:14:25,740
Wow...

377
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,535
- Fuck, with two "S."
- Joysse Kelly. I love it.

378
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,453
- For Christ's sake.
- I love it.

379
00:14:30,453 --> 00:14:32,497
- My drag name now is that.
- Joysse Kelly.

380
00:14:32,497 --> 00:14:33,665
Joysse Kelly.

381
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:35,333
Luan looks like those boys

382
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:37,252
from São Paulo who like
to take you to a funk party.

383
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:38,420
Look at those tactel shorts.

384
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:41,172
He's going
to take us to a funk party. Yes.

385
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,383
- Me, too.
- Take us to a funk party.

386
00:14:43,383 --> 00:14:45,927
That boy has a tattoo,
tactel shorts and flip-flops...

387
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:46,886
I love it!

388
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:48,597
- Flip-flops from?
- From Kenner.

389
00:14:48,597 --> 00:14:49,806
Juliet.

390
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:52,601
I don't bother to watch
if he doesn't appear on my living room TV.

391
00:14:52,601 --> 00:14:54,102
Excuse me?

392
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:56,730
- You can't come in.
- So, I can't come in?

393
00:14:57,272 --> 00:14:58,523
Fuck you!

394
00:15:01,443 --> 00:15:03,820
Kiss!

395
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:06,072
- I love it!
- Hey, João comes and...

396
00:15:06,072 --> 00:15:08,241
A Maria Eugênia. João knows...

397
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,951
Maria Eugênia...

398
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:12,829
He knows how to do his thing. He knows it.

399
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,080
He hooked up with her real fast.

400
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,624
João is doing a lot
and is doing nothing.

401
00:15:15,624 --> 00:15:17,292
He knows how I like it.

402
00:15:17,292 --> 00:15:19,502
João didn't hook up with anyone...

403
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:20,837
But that ass shaking was right.

404
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:23,214
I see. So, he's a dancer, honey.

405
00:15:23,506 --> 00:15:25,550
- He's what?
- A dancer. He's a dancer.

406
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:27,719
No, you can feel it when someone knows it.

407
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:45,487
Oh, my!

408
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:47,864
What will my family think of me?

409
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:49,741
- Me neither.
- Yeah, me neither.

410
00:15:49,741 --> 00:15:50,659
Girl!

411
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:51,660
The grandma...

412
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,495
The snake will look at this and be like...

413
00:15:53,495 --> 00:15:56,956
No, not with me.
Your grandma is going to be cool.

414
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,000
But she will, girl...

415
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:02,796
Hey, Nath?

416
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:04,798
- Yes?
- Are you ready, love?

417
00:16:04,798 --> 00:16:06,508
I can't believe I'm so hot.

418
00:16:06,508 --> 00:16:07,634
Take this heat from inside...

419
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:10,095
Before, it was "love," "Nath,"
"Nath," "love."

420
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,097
Now, it's "love," "baby."

421
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:14,349
- Nathalia! Are you ready?
-"Nathalia."

422
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:23,650
And...

423
00:16:24,192 --> 00:16:25,026
I love it!

424
00:16:25,026 --> 00:16:26,528
You've bitten the pussy in the bus?

425
00:16:26,528 --> 00:16:28,113
I love it when my pussy is bitten.

426
00:16:28,113 --> 00:16:29,823
It's not possible, dude.

427
00:16:29,823 --> 00:16:31,074
I can't believe this.

428
00:16:31,074 --> 00:16:32,033
Or in the pub.

429
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,703
I love when my pussy is bitten, Amazon!

430
00:16:35,328 --> 00:16:36,329
Is biting the pussy allowed?

431
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,997
Because someone is not going to get it.

432
00:16:38,123 --> 00:16:39,124
It's the best!

433
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,418
Do you like it?
Having your pussy bitten.

434
00:16:41,418 --> 00:16:44,003
- Fuck.
- Tell us, Carol. Carol's shaken.

435
00:16:44,129 --> 00:16:48,466
Carol, do you like
having your pussy bitten? "Fuck!"

436
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:53,179
Carol is... She said something
like this... Her hand was shaking.

437
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,891
Guys, wait, they want to interact
with the other table. Look.

438
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:58,518
They're right.

439
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,853
Look me in the eye.

440
00:16:59,853 --> 00:17:02,313
- If I steal a kiss, would you kick my ass?
- No.

441
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:03,857
No?

442
00:17:03,857 --> 00:17:05,066
- Nothing.
- No, really?

443
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,234
No?

444
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,031
You got cheated on

445
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:14,284
I got cheated on

446
00:17:15,076 --> 00:17:16,494
I got cheated on

447
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,997
Women don't know
what to do in those situations.

448
00:17:18,997 --> 00:17:22,000
That's empowerment.
When she looks and says, "Really?"

449
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,002
Empowerment is not making
a scene. It's saying, "Really?

450
00:17:24,002 --> 00:17:25,587
You're doing this to tease me? Watch me."

451
00:17:25,587 --> 00:17:27,172
Go and hook up with three guys.

452
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:29,966
Empowerment is equality.
She has to do the same.

453
00:17:29,966 --> 00:17:31,509
You don't have to fight.

454
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:34,095
There's no need to make a scene.
They're hurting.

455
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:37,098
Empowerment is equality.
She has to do the same.

456
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:38,141
What, girl?

457
00:17:38,141 --> 00:17:40,143
Empowerment is equality.
She can do the same.

458
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:41,853
She's in pain...

459
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:43,855
I don't know if the answer
is doing the same.

460
00:17:43,855 --> 00:17:44,856
Yes, that's true.

461
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:46,357
She must have the right
to do the same.

462
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:47,734
Equality is not vengeance.

463
00:17:47,734 --> 00:17:49,694
She can do whatever he does.

464
00:17:49,694 --> 00:17:51,196
It's not the same thing.

465
00:17:51,196 --> 00:17:52,113
It's only...

466
00:17:52,113 --> 00:17:53,782
That chick there is in pain, those guys

467
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:55,575
are doing what they want,
and the girls are crying.

468
00:17:55,575 --> 00:17:56,785
They can do anything.

469
00:17:56,785 --> 00:17:58,536
You know what the problem is?
Men can hook up

470
00:17:58,536 --> 00:18:01,080
with 50 women, and it's cool. Women can't.

471
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,165
No, that is wrong.

472
00:18:02,165 --> 00:18:05,835
Yes, real nice guy. Super cool.
He wanted to be the best. Well, he got it.

473
00:18:05,835 --> 00:18:07,003
For all that matters, he's the man!

474
00:18:07,003 --> 00:18:07,921
Stop it.

475
00:18:07,921 --> 00:18:10,715
It's what society dictates,
some women can't deal with that.

476
00:18:10,715 --> 00:18:13,802
Because men hook up
with a lot of women and everyone...

477
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:15,345
He's a total jerk...

478
00:18:15,345 --> 00:18:16,971
Most people don't think like that...

479
00:18:16,971 --> 00:18:18,723
Some women can't handle that...

480
00:18:18,723 --> 00:18:20,725
...they don't want
to be judged by everyone.

481
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:23,102
I'm going to talk.
I get what you're saying.

482
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:25,772
Yeah, she has the right
to speak, it's like this...

483
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:27,649
No, that's what I'm talking about.

484
00:18:27,649 --> 00:18:28,858
So, she wants to do something

485
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,235
and she suffers for that jerk,
you know? Stop it. What?

486
00:18:30,235 --> 00:18:31,736
Unfortunately, it's the reality.

487
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,404
Men who hook up with
everyone are stallions.

488
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:36,407
Women are sluts, but it's not like that.

489
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:37,909
Yeah, but that's reality.

490
00:18:37,909 --> 00:18:38,868
Let me tell you something.

491
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:40,912
It was a long time ago.

492
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:43,248
She has the right to speak.
We, as men, can't judge it.

493
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:44,499
It's just... Hey... Wait.

494
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:46,417
Everyone who has the ability...

495
00:18:46,417 --> 00:18:48,461
- It's not a fight.
- Guys, look. Let's...

496
00:18:48,461 --> 00:18:50,088
It's not anything at all.

497
00:18:50,088 --> 00:18:53,842
You can plot, too.
You can vanish for one hour and come back

498
00:18:53,842 --> 00:18:57,971
with an untidy hair,
smeared lipstick. "Hi, guys, what's up?"

499
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:01,099
I'm going to change the subject.

500
00:19:01,099 --> 00:19:02,058
This subject is too boring.

501
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:03,142
Let's do that.

502
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,687
Patriarchy sucks, guys.

503
00:19:05,687 --> 00:19:06,729
Let's hook up with everyone, women.

504
00:19:06,729 --> 00:19:08,356
You can get as many guys as you want.

505
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,650
Who cares what people say?

506
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,986
- And if you don't, that's fine.
- Yes, they can.

507
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:16,614
It's not about what they can do.
They should. They can and they must, man!

508
00:19:16,614 --> 00:19:19,075
If you want to go vegan,
you can do it. I hate it.

509
00:19:19,075 --> 00:19:21,119
Don't feel pressured, hook up with them.

510
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:23,538
A lot of women don't hook up
because they feel the pressure.

511
00:19:23,538 --> 00:19:25,373
John said something nice.
If you want what?

512
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:26,833
Come on!

513
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,084
If she wants to go vegan, she can.

514
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:29,836
The day hasn't even...

515
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,170
So be it! Be free.

516
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,089
Do you know what I would do?

517
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:34,841
- Carol, say it.
- Say it, Carol.

518
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:38,177
I'd tell the other friend,
"Did you see that?" It's crocodile tears.

519
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,972
"What he did to me."
And I'd hook up with the other friend.

520
00:19:40,972 --> 00:19:43,600
This is proof that the attitude of guys...

521
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,642
But, girl...

522
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:46,936
- Crocodile tears.
- No, that's it, that's it.

523
00:19:47,061 --> 00:19:49,105
Things are ugly for them, but I think...

524
00:19:49,105 --> 00:19:50,815
But I think everyone is free...

525
00:19:50,815 --> 00:19:52,692
Everyone is having fun.

526
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,527
It's ugly, that's what...

527
00:19:54,527 --> 00:19:56,279
It's ugly for them, man. Got it?

528
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,656
I don't think he's wrong either. I don't.

529
00:19:58,656 --> 00:20:00,283
Nowadays, there's no right or wrong.

530
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:02,201
There's no "can" or "can't."

531
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:04,829
I just think he's being ungraceful.

532
00:20:04,829 --> 00:20:06,080
I think so, too.

533
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:08,458
Now let's continue,
because there's still a lot.

534
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:10,501
I just wanted to get one more...

535
00:20:11,836 --> 00:20:14,088
This is exactly what we came here for.

536
00:20:14,088 --> 00:20:16,841
Well, I am.
No, that's not what I came here for.

537
00:20:16,841 --> 00:20:19,385
It would be the same thing
if I wanted to control Murilo.

538
00:20:19,385 --> 00:20:23,431
You see?
All I want is to be at that party now.

539
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:25,808
I want to be there, I'd go, "Oops!"

540
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,352
But karma is a bitch!

541
00:20:27,352 --> 00:20:29,812
You reacted just like I did.
I didn't like that.

542
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:32,148
- There's nothing we can do.
- And he kissed her.

543
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:35,735
They're from another table,
he's hugging them, right?

544
00:20:37,612 --> 00:20:39,739
João comes up to the table,
but doesn't bang anyone.

545
00:20:39,739 --> 00:20:42,033
He's that guy
who doesn't pick up any girls.

546
00:20:42,033 --> 00:20:43,993
He likes to show off for his friends...

547
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:46,037
He doesn't pick anyone up.

548
00:20:46,037 --> 00:20:47,914
What is it called?
Wire fence with no spikes.

549
00:20:47,914 --> 00:20:49,624
It just surrounds you.
It doesn't jab you.

550
00:20:49,624 --> 00:20:50,541
Everyone has...

551
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:51,501
The microwave friend.

552
00:20:51,501 --> 00:20:53,127
He heats up the food and other people
eat it.

553
00:20:53,127 --> 00:20:54,128
Do you have friends like that?

554
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:56,297
I have a lot of microwave friends.

555
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:58,007
They heat up the lunch
and other people bang.

556
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:01,135
Who never hooked up with someone who
your friend talked the whole night with

557
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:02,679
and you went there and picked up?

558
00:21:08,059 --> 00:21:10,144
Man, you fucking suck.

559
00:21:10,144 --> 00:21:11,437
I fuck, what?

560
00:21:11,437 --> 00:21:15,900
You got cheated on before,
and now you're cheating on him? Payback?

561
00:21:19,237 --> 00:21:20,738
Girlfriend.

562
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:22,615
- Girlfriend, don't fall down.
- Sit down.

563
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:24,325
- That's me talking.
- I'm that one.

564
00:21:24,325 --> 00:21:25,994
"Don't fall down. Girlfriend."

565
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,037
- I'm the one who falls down.
- Nathalia is wasted.

566
00:21:28,037 --> 00:21:29,831
I say, "Don't fall down."

567
00:21:29,831 --> 00:21:31,708
You're the one who falls down.

568
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:34,252
"Don't fall for him,"
that's what I'm saying.

569
00:21:34,252 --> 00:21:36,254
I'm not talking about falling down

570
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:38,172
because you're wasted,
"Don't fall for him."

571
00:21:38,172 --> 00:21:40,258
- He's sober.
- Nathalia is wasted.

572
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:44,095
We have ordered some water for you.
Do you need to use the restroom?

573
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:48,182
We have ordered some water for you.
Do you need to use the restroom?

574
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:50,810
You know I was with him, right?
He told you that.

575
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,853
I got cheated on.

576
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:54,188
I asked him about that. So sorry.

577
00:21:54,355 --> 00:21:57,483
No, relax, he's all yours.
Because I don't...

578
00:21:57,483 --> 00:21:58,943
No. About that...

579
00:21:58,943 --> 00:22:02,238
- I don't think that's the point.
- You... Fuck you!

580
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,073
- Princess, you...
- Fuck you, Ramon.

581
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,743
You're falling down
like crazy, damn it.

582
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:09,954
- Girlfriend, I am from Magic Island.
- Fuck you, Ramon.

583
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:14,042
Go on, then. I was serious.
Stop falling down.

584
00:22:16,627 --> 00:22:19,255
- What he did was stupid.
- He's a jerk.

585
00:22:19,255 --> 00:22:20,715
I didn't get it. I didn't.

586
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:22,091
Now the show's on.

587
00:22:22,091 --> 00:22:25,344
Now's the time the baby cries
and the mother doesn't see it.

588
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,971
That's the booze talking.

589
00:22:26,971 --> 00:22:28,139
I love it. I do!

590
00:22:28,139 --> 00:22:30,141
This is a pub, it's not even a party.

591
00:22:30,141 --> 00:22:32,310
- Me and Bianca there.
- It's the end of me.

592
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,270
I'm the one who's with Bianca.
I really am.

593
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:36,731
The guys got upset now.

594
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:38,733
Do you see how shocking it is?

595
00:22:38,733 --> 00:22:41,027
Then the guy says, "Now I'm fucked up.

596
00:22:41,027 --> 00:22:42,737
The chicks are on the loose."

597
00:22:42,737 --> 00:22:44,405
I'm that one, you bet I am.

598
00:22:44,405 --> 00:22:47,033
Baby, I'd make a scene on that floor.

599
00:22:47,033 --> 00:22:49,368
I'd stand up beautiful.

600
00:22:51,454 --> 00:22:54,707
"What? Are you blowing me off?
Because I'm going to make a scene."

601
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:55,958
- They're upset.
- Fall down again.

602
00:22:55,958 --> 00:22:57,460
"What?"

603
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,295
João is a showman.

604
00:22:59,295 --> 00:23:01,631
She'd fall down and say, "What is it?"

605
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:03,591
No somersaults,
for the love of God!

606
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:08,638
You're such a sweetheart, you know?
Thank you!

607
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:13,434
Putting up with me is not easy.
Now, with me and your friends together...

608
00:23:13,434 --> 00:23:16,145
Attention, everyone!

609
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:22,443
Good morning, João!
Whoever wants to go to the afterparty,

610
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:25,113
stick with Daddy! It's time!

611
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:26,739
He'd have to be very good...

612
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,991
Wearing that track suit,
like an elderly...

613
00:23:28,991 --> 00:23:30,409
What did he say?

614
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,328
Who's ready for the afterparty?

615
00:23:32,328 --> 00:23:35,123
I think I wouldn't look at a guy
like him, I'd just fuck him.

616
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:37,083
But I'd ask him to tell no one.

617
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,293
Like, "Don't tell anyone, please."

618
00:23:39,293 --> 00:23:40,878
"In the name of our friendship,
don't tell."

619
00:23:40,878 --> 00:23:43,172
In the name of my Instagram profile.

620
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:45,133
In the name
of my merchandising publications.

621
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:46,843
In the name of my "at" sign.

622
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:54,350
...being a loser is totally different.

623
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:56,435
- No!
- But what happened?

624
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:57,353
You're my friend.

625
00:23:57,353 --> 00:23:58,563
He is talking...

626
00:23:58,563 --> 00:24:01,774
Do you think she'd be happy
if I talked to you like this?

627
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:05,653
- Bia, come here.
- Look, you're a grown woman.

628
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:06,696
Hey, wonderful girl!

629
00:24:06,696 --> 00:24:11,117
Don't lose your mind, okay?
That one over there is going crazy.

630
00:24:11,117 --> 00:24:14,537
Don't you dare tell me not to lose
my mind, we haven't even talked yet.

631
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:16,164
I'm talking to them, not to you.

632
00:24:16,164 --> 00:24:17,665
Get in the groove.

633
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:19,333
Things are going
to get real ugly now.

634
00:24:19,333 --> 00:24:21,794
We're home! Make yourselves at home!

635
00:24:21,794 --> 00:24:23,504
Hey, that's fucked up, look.

636
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:24,881
It's already fucked up.

637
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:26,257
Those guys banged the girls,

638
00:24:26,257 --> 00:24:28,259
now they brought two other girls
to the house.

639
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:29,969
The chicks
are not going to like them.

640
00:24:29,969 --> 00:24:31,220
Of course not.

641
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:33,264
Check out this view!

642
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:35,516
I'd be very upset if this happened. João!

643
00:24:35,516 --> 00:24:36,642
This is Nathalia.

644
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:38,144
João, come on...

645
00:24:38,769 --> 00:24:40,146
She's drunk, wasted.

646
00:24:40,146 --> 00:24:44,150
Guys, if I don't see João hooking up
with someone until the end of this series,

647
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,235
I'm going to be very upset.
It's personally.

648
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:49,655
- Disappointed.
- Because he's the most annoying.

649
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,616
Jesus, there are some guys there,

650
00:24:51,616 --> 00:24:54,243
"Thanks for asking me
to be a part of the show."

651
00:24:54,243 --> 00:24:55,328
They were the last ones to be asked.

652
00:24:56,829 --> 00:24:58,748
- Cigarette.
- Where am I going to sleep?

653
00:24:58,748 --> 00:25:00,041
I'm just going to put
a mattress here.

654
00:25:00,041 --> 00:25:01,709
...over there Tarzan?

655
00:25:01,709 --> 00:25:02,793
- She's too wasted.
- Tarzan.

656
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:03,711
Who's Tarzan?

657
00:25:03,711 --> 00:25:06,130
This is Luan.
Luan wants to fuck Nathalia's pussy.

658
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:08,257
Tarzan is that guy from earlier.

659
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,800
It's windy inside that room.

660
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,677
Boy! It's a tsunami.

661
00:25:13,054 --> 00:25:14,889
I found it cute when he took her upstairs.

662
00:25:15,014 --> 00:25:16,349
He has to bathe her

663
00:25:16,349 --> 00:25:18,517
and put her to bed. He has to do it.

664
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:20,937
Disagreement is not the point.
If he tries something...

665
00:25:20,937 --> 00:25:22,647
- That's it.
- Attention!

666
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:24,315
I think I'll have to go upstairs...

667
00:25:24,315 --> 00:25:25,775
Is there something going on...

668
00:25:25,775 --> 00:25:28,653
Nothing is going on.
He's just protecting her.

669
00:25:28,653 --> 00:25:30,238
She's going to hug and cuddle...

670
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:32,490
Just like she was with her...

671
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:34,533
That's it. That's what I'm saying.

672
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,036
It was his fault, not hers.

673
00:25:37,036 --> 00:25:40,164
- I find it cute, but...
- He's going to give her some medicine.

674
00:25:40,164 --> 00:25:43,751
- See if he doesn't have bad intentions.
- I think I'd fuck him.

675
00:25:43,751 --> 00:25:44,669
Shut up.

676
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:46,754
She isn't thinking right at the moment.

677
00:25:46,754 --> 00:25:48,214
She's drunk. She can't tell...

678
00:25:48,214 --> 00:25:52,176
I was going to ask you.
If one comes to me, then the other...

679
00:25:52,176 --> 00:25:54,720
Please! Get me out of there,
throw me in the pool.

680
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:58,766
But don't let me,
because shit is going to hit the fan.

681
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:01,394
I'll smack one or the other.
That's the way things are.

682
00:26:01,394 --> 00:26:04,897
- It's all right, it's UFC.
- She's Carol. She has Carol's instincts.

683
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:08,734
It's Carol. It's true, man. Isn't it?
Did you sleep? Tell the truth.

684
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:12,196
Guys, look at that girl's face,
the one who isn't staying in the house.

685
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:13,406
"What am I doing here?"

686
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:20,246
It's like that aunt who gossips
looking out the window.

687
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:21,789
Let's go downstairs.

688
00:26:25,459 --> 00:26:28,421
That's just trouble. She's drunk.

689
00:26:28,421 --> 00:26:29,463
Go to the stairs.

690
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,383
He wants that trouble.

691
00:26:35,678 --> 00:26:39,056
- Hey, pretty thing!
- Hey, pretty thing!

692
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:41,934
João is the funny guy, that João.

693
00:26:41,934 --> 00:26:46,105
You left that drunk chick over there.

694
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:48,441
The cell phone.
My God, I wonder who it is.

695
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:50,693
Good news or bad news first?

696
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:53,154
- The good news.
- We're going to have to work tomorrow.

697
00:26:53,154 --> 00:26:54,155
- Cool!
- All right?

698
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:56,532
- Then we'll work.
- Work was never the problem.

699
00:26:56,532 --> 00:26:58,242
I just wanted to tell everybody.

700
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:01,412
I'll let you know the time tomorrow, okay?

701
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:04,290
You just need to know
that we're working tomorrow, all right?

702
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,291
And the good news?

703
00:27:05,291 --> 00:27:06,751
The good news is we're here in this house.

704
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:10,880
- I like him. He's the guy I like.
- He's good, too. I liked him.

705
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:13,174
I'd be his friend... I'd suck him...

706
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:15,676
It'd be a bromance...
A dick in my mouth...

707
00:27:15,676 --> 00:27:16,927
What?

708
00:27:16,927 --> 00:27:19,055
I'd suck him because he's nice, got it?

709
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:20,848
I don't know if I'd suck him.

710
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:23,184
Wouldn't you suck someone because
he's charismatic? If the person

711
00:27:23,184 --> 00:27:25,144
was nice to me, I'd say,
"Give me that."

712
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:27,063
My rule is being charismatic. Always.

713
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:29,023
Being charismatic
is not even having a sex appeal.

714
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:31,108
Does anyone have
an energy drink for Carol?

715
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:32,068
She drank chocolate milk.

716
00:27:32,068 --> 00:27:34,111
She had chocolate milk and fell asleep.

717
00:27:34,111 --> 00:27:36,781
I'm trying to understand
the charisma thing...

718
00:27:36,781 --> 00:27:38,699
No, I don't like nice guys. No, man.

719
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:40,451
Since the start of the series...

720
00:27:40,451 --> 00:27:42,119
What kind of man do you like?

721
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,579
I like serious men.

722
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:45,664
He is serious, he said,

723
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:47,583
"We'll work tomorrow, stay tuned."

724
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,210
A family guy doesn't hook up.

725
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,378
He's not hooking up with anyone.

726
00:27:50,378 --> 00:27:52,254
But where do you find that guy?

727
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:53,422
He's real.

728
00:27:56,509 --> 00:28:01,722
It's just wrong that you didn't talk to me
and then said bullshit behind my back.

729
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:04,475
Don't talk shit to me, just don't.

730
00:28:04,475 --> 00:28:07,269
Crap, talk to me, then.
I'm right here. I'm a man!

731
00:28:07,269 --> 00:28:09,480
- And I'm a woman!
- Then tell it to my face.

732
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,481
Take it.

733
00:28:10,481 --> 00:28:13,150
I'll think that now
because I'm a mature person...

734
00:28:13,150 --> 00:28:15,236
She stuttered, he's fucked up!

735
00:28:15,236 --> 00:28:16,278
You're mature?

736
00:28:16,278 --> 00:28:17,530
- It's clear.
- I am wasted.

737
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,031
If we talk now,
things are getting ugly.

738
00:28:19,031 --> 00:28:20,491
If I talk to you right now...

739
00:28:20,491 --> 00:28:21,534
Blame it on the booze.

740
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:22,993
I've never seen a drunk person...

741
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:24,245
Because you're being selfish again?

742
00:28:24,245 --> 00:28:26,163
You didn't even want
to face your own stuff.

743
00:28:26,163 --> 00:28:28,374
This is why I don't want talk.

744
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:30,584
So we're sleeping together for no reason?

745
00:28:30,584 --> 00:28:33,879
I was just chilling.
You're pointing a finger at me.

746
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:35,548
Because I don't want to talk today?

747
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:37,675
- You are being fake.
- I am being myself!

748
00:28:37,675 --> 00:28:40,386
Oh, yeah? That's cool,
be yourself. Just be yourself.

749
00:28:40,386 --> 00:28:43,347
I don't want to talk to you or to her,
because I am drunk.

750
00:28:43,347 --> 00:28:44,640
So go upstairs, it's our house.

751
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:46,058
Luan is fucking up the scenario.

752
00:28:46,058 --> 00:28:47,977
He's needy. That chick doesn't want

753
00:28:47,977 --> 00:28:50,229
to talk to him,
she already said it, he's on to her.

754
00:28:50,354 --> 00:28:51,897
Get out of there. Just bounce.

755
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:54,024
João is just laughing.

756
00:28:54,150 --> 00:28:57,445
- João is needy and sad.
- Guys, I'm like João.

757
00:28:57,445 --> 00:28:58,654
Who's that again?

758
00:28:58,654 --> 00:29:01,240
Guys, she was my animal. If I was wasted,

759
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:06,454
I wouldn't want to talk to anyone.
Let's talk tomorrow morning.

760
00:29:06,912 --> 00:29:09,915
- I think they're going to talk in private.
- No one saw anything.

761
00:29:09,915 --> 00:29:12,710
- Things are going to get nasty.
- Right? Now it's...

762
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:16,213
No, for heaven's sake. We're good.

763
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:18,591
I want to hear your version now.

764
00:29:18,716 --> 00:29:21,302
I was with everybody, like you were
with everybody.

765
00:29:21,302 --> 00:29:23,053
Nath's guy hooked up with someone else.

766
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:25,473
Do you think I was going
to leave her alone?

767
00:29:25,473 --> 00:29:27,475
If you're fucking me...

768
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:31,312
Lower your fucking finger, fuck.
Don't stick a finger in my face.

769
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:34,064
Look. That's ungraceful.

770
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,399
"You're fucking me."

771
00:29:35,399 --> 00:29:37,193
Fine. For me, it doesn't.

772
00:29:37,193 --> 00:29:41,697
Hey, you have
a loose screw in your head. You're crazy.

773
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:45,326
If I wanted to hook up
with her, I would have.

774
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:47,620
You said I have a loose screw.
Have I offended you?

775
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,413
Have I said that you're weak?

776
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,373
You're crazy. You haven't?

777
00:29:51,373 --> 00:29:53,501
Is disrespect.

778
00:29:53,501 --> 00:29:55,961
Learn how to talk to me.
You wanted to talk.

779
00:29:55,961 --> 00:29:57,880
Learn how to talk to me. Got it?

780
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,591
We are talking. Stop being a bitch.

781
00:30:00,591 --> 00:30:02,676
Shove that loose screw up your ass.

782
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:07,264
- Stop being an asshole?
- That was you. She's Bianca.

783
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:09,975
"Shove that loose screw up your ass."
I used to say.

784
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:12,269
We're not on the same vibe anymore.

785
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:13,854
We haven't been for a while.

786
00:30:13,854 --> 00:30:15,648
Your little head is full of shit.

787
00:30:24,615 --> 00:30:28,327
See? They're not even married. and
the man's sleeping on the couch. See?

788
00:30:28,327 --> 00:30:30,788
Well, if the shoe fits, wear it.

789
00:30:30,788 --> 00:30:32,706
If you're sleeping on the couch,

790
00:30:32,706 --> 00:30:35,209
you're in trouble. "Man, that was wrong."

791
00:30:35,209 --> 00:30:36,752
If someone's upset, go somewhere else.

792
00:30:36,752 --> 00:30:37,920
He really stayed away.

793
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,256
The girl is going
to talk to him on the couch.

794
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:41,382
But she was also...

795
00:30:41,382 --> 00:30:43,717
She's going to wake up
the next morning,

796
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:46,595
they're going to have a chat
and kiss again...

797
00:30:46,595 --> 00:30:49,348
I believe we can expect it
on this same episode.

798
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:52,434
The truth is you can never win
an argument with a woman.

799
00:30:52,434 --> 00:30:53,852
You'll never win an argument.

800
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,020
They're always right.

801
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:57,314
It's better being happy than being right.

802
00:30:57,314 --> 00:31:01,068
- I like this sentence.
- Did you get it? Be cool, put up with her.

803
00:31:01,068 --> 00:31:01,986
Yeah, baby.

804
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:04,196
ON THE NEXT EPISODE

805
00:31:04,196 --> 00:31:06,031
- João?
- Girlfriend!

806
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:06,991
João?

807
00:31:06,991 --> 00:31:09,702
- I want to see if he has a big dick.
- Shut up.

808
00:31:09,702 --> 00:31:11,328
I said it out loud.

809
00:31:11,328 --> 00:31:13,372
What's a man able to do
when he wants to fuck?

810
00:31:13,497 --> 00:31:15,624
- Holy shit!
- He cried!

811
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:17,751
D-I-C-K. On vacation.
