WILD AND FREE: FLORIANÓPOLIS
THE REVIEW

2
00:00:20,312 --> 00:00:24,024
Guys, João surprised me because he had
more sex than everybody in one day.

3
00:00:24,024 --> 00:00:25,025
That's true.

4
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:28,821
Guys, seriously, I want to know
how João's life is.

5
00:00:28,821 --> 00:00:29,905
Because he's...

6
00:00:29,905 --> 00:00:32,783
- João is a mystery to me.
- He started being something...

7
00:00:32,783 --> 00:00:35,911
We call it a "virgin" in Salvador.
Is it the same here?

8
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:37,913
- It's called a virgin.
- Sure. Virgin.

9
00:00:37,913 --> 00:00:41,584
He started as a virgin,
then he said, "I only date."

10
00:00:41,584 --> 00:00:43,085
In a while, baby...

11
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,546
I thought about that sex the whole week.

12
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:48,466
Why did he say he wasn't
a fucker and did that?

13
00:00:48,466 --> 00:00:51,802
Girl, he must be from Minas Gerais.
He does things quietly.

14
00:00:51,802 --> 00:00:53,220
That's true.

15
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:54,930
Nice to meet you, do me quietly.

16
00:00:56,474 --> 00:00:59,310
I want to watch it. Shall we?
Can I press play, Bianca?

17
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,936
You can, honey.

18
00:01:00,936 --> 00:01:02,480
She's at her home.

19
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,649
But episode five ended like that.
I remember some trouble.

20
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,235
I'm shocked you're doing this to me.

21
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:11,280
Press play. Use your heel
to do it, I know you like it.

22
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,115
What a heel. You killed it.

23
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:23,292
- Bring it on, man.
- Floripa!

24
00:01:24,752 --> 00:01:27,922
- Do you want to sit down?
- I didn't sleep like this, you know?

25
00:01:27,922 --> 00:01:32,676
No? You acted like a saint.
But you didn't...

26
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:35,179
If you sleep with somebody...

27
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:37,848
I can't believe what I'm seeing.

28
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,433
I very much believe it.

29
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:42,603
Because she was tempted to do that.
She said she wanted to...

30
00:01:42,603 --> 00:01:46,982
The worst is that dishonesty from her.
Using a person...

31
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,108
Both of them, man.

32
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:51,445
As much as the person knows everything,
like her crush,

33
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:54,323
but she's using him
and manipulating the situation.

34
00:01:54,323 --> 00:01:55,741
It's a lack of character.

35
00:01:55,741 --> 00:01:59,036
She keeps playing these kind of games.
No, it makes me bored.

36
00:01:59,036 --> 00:02:00,371
I was hooking up with...

37
00:02:00,371 --> 00:02:01,956
You criticize her, but you...

38
00:02:01,956 --> 00:02:04,667
But I'm here to criticize,
not to stay quiet.

39
00:02:05,167 --> 00:02:06,126
Doesn't mean...

40
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:10,256
I already hooked up with a guy at a club,
then I saw him with another guy,

41
00:02:10,256 --> 00:02:11,715
I hooked up in front of him.

42
00:02:11,715 --> 00:02:13,926
I talked to a lot of people...

43
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:15,177
I see.

44
00:02:15,177 --> 00:02:17,763
...just to annoy him.

45
00:02:17,763 --> 00:02:20,558
In the end, I screwed up.
The same happened to her.

46
00:02:20,558 --> 00:02:22,268
I ended up being the loser,

47
00:02:22,268 --> 00:02:24,478
making a fool of myself.

48
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,355
So, I think that's not right.

49
00:02:26,689 --> 00:02:28,482
I started seeing a guy,

50
00:02:28,482 --> 00:02:31,193
and he was not very much into it...

51
00:02:31,193 --> 00:02:34,029
I realized he was kind of distant,

52
00:02:34,154 --> 00:02:36,156
and I said,
"Cool, his brother is hot."

53
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,449
I hooked up with his brother.

54
00:02:37,449 --> 00:02:41,328
Then he got hornier, and I ended up
hooking up with both of them.

55
00:02:41,328 --> 00:02:43,789
- Did they know?
- They saw everything.

56
00:02:43,789 --> 00:02:45,124
Same house, same room.

57
00:02:45,124 --> 00:02:51,088
Let's go. You're invited. You can come.

58
00:02:51,505 --> 00:02:53,591
- Look at Ramon...
- Look at Ramon's face.

59
00:02:53,591 --> 00:02:56,010
- Look at his face.
- Look at Ramon's face.

60
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,013
Did he want her to go, guys?

61
00:02:59,013 --> 00:03:01,932
The same look a young man has
when he goes into my place.

62
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:03,309
Did you hear that?

63
00:03:03,309 --> 00:03:04,602
"Am I going?" He said, "Sure."

64
00:03:04,602 --> 00:03:05,686
I loved...

65
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:06,770
"You're invited."

66
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:09,273
Look at his face. No... I liked it a lot.

67
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:11,358
He thought, "Today's the day."

68
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:13,360
Checked his underwear, "Today's the day."

69
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:16,989
- Why are you like this?
- What do you wanna hear?

70
00:03:16,989 --> 00:03:18,699
I want to know the truth.

71
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,576
- What do you wanna hear?
- The truth.

72
00:03:21,785 --> 00:03:24,079
Really? Do you want to hear it?

73
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:27,291
Really? I won't tell you.

74
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:28,334
Yes. Say it...

75
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,879
When she drinks, she loses it.

76
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,548
Man, she's kind of a villain.

77
00:03:34,548 --> 00:03:37,051
- She messes up a lot.
- I can't understand her.

78
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:39,094
Is she going to come at Ramon's chick?

79
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,388
Mauro... Mauro, grow up.

80
00:03:41,931 --> 00:03:44,141
Grow up, me? I've already grown up a lot.

81
00:03:44,141 --> 00:03:47,186
For Christ's sake. Ramon, did we hook up?

82
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:48,771
- No.
- Man, when did I say this?

83
00:03:48,771 --> 00:03:49,897
Did you hit on me?

84
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:53,692
What the fuck are you talking about?
What are you talking about?

85
00:03:54,109 --> 00:03:55,986
We didn't do anything.

86
00:03:55,986 --> 00:03:57,821
I've said it, I'll say it again.

87
00:03:57,821 --> 00:03:59,448
I want to hook up with him? Yes.

88
00:03:59,448 --> 00:04:02,826
Am I jealous of him? Yes.
That's the guy I...

89
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,536
Why am I talking to you?

90
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:07,623
I did nothing.
Why are you suspicious of me?

91
00:04:07,623 --> 00:04:09,541
Do you want to curse me out?

92
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,127
You should charge for this show
you're putting on.

93
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,880
No, bro.

94
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:19,051
Guys, I wonder
if she's a desperate, needy person.

95
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:21,595
I think she's like Rubi.

96
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:24,223
Rubi, right? She's like Regina George.

97
00:04:24,223 --> 00:04:27,267
I think she's very delusional about it.

98
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,895
She's not acting normal
because of all of that.

99
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,313
Far away from loved ones.

100
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:34,274
What would you do with someone
who's suffocating like her?

101
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:37,653
- We feel suffocated, man.
- I think sometimes we need cleansing.

102
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:39,863
We need to clean our chakras.

103
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:43,200
She needs a cleansing,
a healing touch, I don't know.

104
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,910
She does that to every guy, man.

105
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:48,247
She's desperate for Ramon.
She called Mauro because of Ramon.

106
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:51,083
If you were Ramon,
would you give her a chance?

107
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,002
- I wouldn't.
- I'd call the cops.

108
00:04:55,337 --> 00:04:58,924
He's so upset, he thought, "I'm leaving.
I won't wait until tomorrow."

109
00:04:58,924 --> 00:05:02,386
Jeez, guys, I feel so bad for that boy.

110
00:05:02,386 --> 00:05:03,929
That's unfair, he was called...

111
00:05:03,929 --> 00:05:07,266
- He's cute.
- Poor guy, he was kicked down the steps.

112
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:10,060
Hey, cutie, don't be sad,
Nathalia doesn't deserve you.

113
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:12,396
- I'm really sorry.
- About what?

114
00:05:13,564 --> 00:05:14,982
About saying shit to Mauro.

115
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:17,693
- Because of what you said?
- I'm very upset.

116
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:21,155
Is it Nathalia? She went to Ramon
to talk about the guy.

117
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,490
What is that bowl for, guys?

118
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:24,950
- She's eating...
- What is it?

119
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,745
- It's cake. It's a birthday cake bowl.
- What?

120
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:28,912
It's Tupperware.

121
00:05:29,371 --> 00:05:31,999
- Then you said that...
- I ended up saying too much.

122
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:39,173
- What advice would you give her?
- I'd tell her to be cool, enjoy the party

123
00:05:39,173 --> 00:05:41,592
and not hook up with any boy
for no reason.

124
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:44,178
It's better for her to wait...

125
00:05:44,178 --> 00:05:46,930
- I'd tell her to take antidepressants.
- Or a coach.

126
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:50,726
What if she's in love and is
doing that 'cause she's out of control...

127
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,728
This is a kind of love...

128
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:54,188
Passion is something much...

129
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:57,232
Passion is something much better
than love at some points.

130
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,610
Passion has a fire that love doesn't have.

131
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:01,862
You have to enjoy it while you still can.

132
00:06:01,862 --> 00:06:03,947
When you touch someone,
you get a shock.

133
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:08,494
Love is something that takes time,
intimacy, respect and a lot of things.

134
00:06:08,494 --> 00:06:13,290
Do you remember that party
we were invited to, at that DJ's place?

135
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:15,167
- The DJ.
- Let's get ready?

136
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:18,212
Drink for free? Let's go!

137
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:19,963
Bro, like, dude wants...

138
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:22,716
She's suffering for one,
and going out to see another.

139
00:06:22,716 --> 00:06:25,928
This is the meme Nathalia.

140
00:06:25,928 --> 00:06:28,347
If she has to suffer,
may she do it being pretty.

141
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,438
Jeez, the soundtrack is really cool.

142
00:06:36,438 --> 00:06:37,523
I like this one.

143
00:06:37,523 --> 00:06:41,360
What he...
It raises the bar for Brazil. Right?

144
00:06:41,735 --> 00:06:43,153
What are you talking about?

145
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:48,575
Guys, who's that rich sugar daddy?
Two cars in the garage.

146
00:06:48,575 --> 00:06:50,035
Look at the size of the door.

147
00:06:50,035 --> 00:06:51,954
- Stop doing this.
- Three.

148
00:06:51,954 --> 00:06:54,164
- Oh, my God.
- That's not new to you.

149
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,838
I love it.

150
00:07:02,506 --> 00:07:03,966
Wonderful.

151
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,021
Summer here is crazy.

152
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:23,277
I play in the band besides working.
Man, there's three parties every day.

153
00:07:23,277 --> 00:07:24,361
Must be awesome.

154
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,279
Every day.

155
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:28,532
I've already been here before.
It was winter, though.

156
00:07:28,532 --> 00:07:31,160
- I forgot she wants him.
- Yeah.

157
00:07:31,743 --> 00:07:34,705
- There's that boy Tay set her up with.
- Look at Ramon, man.

158
00:07:34,705 --> 00:07:36,874
Ramon is a clumsy dancer, right?

159
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:38,417
But he's cute.

160
00:07:38,417 --> 00:07:40,711
- Who's that girl? Is it Taynara?
- It's Tay.

161
00:07:41,712 --> 00:07:45,174
- With her man, she doesn't want trouble.
- Baby, she feels at peace.

162
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:47,301
Ramon is out of the picture?

163
00:07:48,969 --> 00:07:51,638
Have you seen the phoenix?
Rising from ashes.

164
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:53,765
That's what he did...

165
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:54,850
Stop, Ramon.

166
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:57,561
Wanna kiss somebody?
Don't let Ramon get in your way.

167
00:07:57,561 --> 00:07:59,188
But Ramon couldn't care less.

168
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:01,064
Guys, that's it...

169
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:04,318
Maybe she's fantasizing
this whole romance.

170
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,487
Girl, I don't know why.

171
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,948
She went there looking for trouble.

172
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:12,910
She's really an attention whore.
I don't know what to say.

173
00:08:14,203 --> 00:08:15,579
I don't want them together.

174
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:17,748
Oh, no, they're kissing.

175
00:08:17,748 --> 00:08:20,042
No, Ramon! Don't you do this to yourself.

176
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:21,877
- I told you.
- Holy shit.

177
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:23,170
Look at the blond DJ.

178
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,922
I've been trying
not to say "I love you".

179
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,548
- What did he say?
-"I love you."

180
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:28,217
"Trying not to say 'I love you'."

181
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:30,761
I've been trying
not to say "I love you".

182
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:32,387
He didn't say that, John...

183
00:08:32,721 --> 00:08:35,224
I told you, Brazil,
he would come back to her.

184
00:08:35,224 --> 00:08:38,268
- No, that guy should be spanked...
- Dear Lord.

185
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:42,356
When someone says, "I love you,"
that's a whole different story.

186
00:08:42,356 --> 00:08:43,899
That doesn't change anything.

187
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:47,194
If a guy told you,
"Pabllo, I love you," what would you do?

188
00:08:47,194 --> 00:08:48,237
You know what...

189
00:08:48,237 --> 00:08:49,446
I wonder if he's...

190
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:51,448
...she didn't hear and say, "Huh?"

191
00:08:51,448 --> 00:08:55,953
I'd see that things were getting serious
and I'd bounce, sis.

192
00:08:55,953 --> 00:08:58,205
- That's a lie.
- Especially in two days.

193
00:08:59,248 --> 00:09:01,959
Dude... If you want to,
do whatever you want.

194
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:03,752
Right? You're free.

195
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:09,091
Don't be a phony and say,
"I wanted Ramon."

196
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,842
That's enough of that, okay?

197
00:09:10,842 --> 00:09:13,178
If you want Ramon,
you go there and kiss him.

198
00:09:13,178 --> 00:09:16,598
Don't do this. It's looking bad.
I'm saying this as your friend.

199
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:17,724
Nath, cut it out.

200
00:09:17,724 --> 00:09:19,601
Beatriz, I love you!

201
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,728
- Bia was very sensible.
- Bia is a fool.

202
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,105
Beatriz took her to task.

203
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:25,941
Now she's going to
take Beatriz down, I bet.

204
00:09:25,941 --> 00:09:27,484
No, girl... It's like this...

205
00:09:27,484 --> 00:09:29,361
Why is Bia a fool?

206
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:31,947
Bia is a fool for wasting her time
with Nathalia.

207
00:09:31,947 --> 00:09:33,824
Look at him dancing, this is awful.

208
00:09:33,824 --> 00:09:34,950
He's like a worm.

209
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,076
Guys...

210
00:09:36,076 --> 00:09:37,869
Teach him how to
rub against someone.

211
00:09:37,869 --> 00:09:40,831
Does he dance like that in Niterói?
He's from Niterói.

212
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:41,915
I ship that couple.

213
00:09:41,915 --> 00:09:43,000
Take it.

214
00:09:50,048 --> 00:09:53,218
Girl, morning has broken.
They didn't show the house, nothing.

215
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:58,181
- I want that house.
- Do you? I'll sell it to you.

216
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,266
But...

217
00:10:00,851 --> 00:10:03,061
- She wants to buy it legally.
- Take me there, Titto.

218
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,689
Amazon rented it from my daddy
for $300 a day.

219
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:07,482
You and Nath didn't hook up yesterday?

220
00:10:07,482 --> 00:10:09,234
- No.
- Nothing? Not even a kiss?

221
00:10:09,234 --> 00:10:10,861
It won't happen again.

222
00:10:10,861 --> 00:10:13,447
I'm telling you this.
It's not going to happen.

223
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:15,157
It's not?

224
00:10:15,157 --> 00:10:16,283
What did he say?

225
00:10:16,283 --> 00:10:17,367
Paraphernalia.

226
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,203
I love you, Ramon, keep being like this.

227
00:10:20,203 --> 00:10:23,040
- Don't let me down.
- He won't. He'll hook up with her.

228
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,125
He won't. He's realized she's kind of...

229
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:29,046
Guys, have you found out
who had sex or not yet?

230
00:10:29,046 --> 00:10:30,756
Blondie hasn't had sex, right?

231
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:32,966
Man, you know what's worse?

232
00:10:32,966 --> 00:10:36,094
- She's not upset about that.
- She's wonderful.

233
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:39,473
João got upset when he didn't have sex.

234
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:40,557
No, we got upset.

235
00:10:40,557 --> 00:10:43,602
Sometimes I'm like her,
and I don't hook up with anyone.

236
00:10:43,602 --> 00:10:45,270
She's hooking up with everyone.

237
00:10:45,270 --> 00:10:48,440
- I'd rather have fun with my friends.
- Sometimes I'm like her.

238
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,650
I'd rather both options
if it's possible.

239
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,860
If not, that's okay.

240
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,071
But it has already happened, and don't...

241
00:10:54,071 --> 00:10:55,364
Everything is wonderful.

242
00:10:55,364 --> 00:10:57,908
Sometimes, don't you just want to
go out and have fun?

243
00:10:57,908 --> 00:10:59,159
I'm like this a lot.

244
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,827
I say, "Tonight I'm having fun,

245
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:03,538
but if I meet someone,
that's okay, I'm not dead."

246
00:11:03,538 --> 00:11:05,457
I'm not shutting my door
for a boy either.

247
00:11:05,457 --> 00:11:06,708
If he gets in, he gets in.

248
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,169
It's like Carol,
she sleeps with the door open.

249
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,129
Carol is a mafia woman.

250
00:11:11,129 --> 00:11:13,632
Do you ever go to a party
and don't hook up?

251
00:11:13,632 --> 00:11:15,675
Kissing someone at a party, man?

252
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:21,807
No, I just say, "Give me your number."
Then I set a date for another day.

253
00:11:21,807 --> 00:11:23,558
And on the streets?

254
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,563
- Do you do this on the streets?
- I stop the car, "Let me talk to you."

255
00:11:28,563 --> 00:11:31,233
What if you hear a no?
What if you get rejected?

256
00:11:31,358 --> 00:11:32,859
Have you ever been rejected?

257
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:35,987
I've got a thing, I don't know.
I have something, you know?

258
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:37,072
She's the best.

259
00:11:37,072 --> 00:11:39,658
No, you know what?
I think you're empowered.

260
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,410
You have confidence.

261
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,536
She's not!

262
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:45,247
She's more unbreakable than a rock.
For love...

263
00:11:45,247 --> 00:11:46,456
What? Hi.

264
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,750
Pabllo, have you ever been rejected?

265
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,460
You hit on anyone,
and the person said no?

266
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,629
- I have.
- Bullshit! Recently?

267
00:11:52,629 --> 00:11:55,757
Not recently because
I don't even go out...

268
00:11:55,757 --> 00:11:57,426
After being famous or before?

269
00:11:57,426 --> 00:12:00,178
I've been rejected.
Just because we're recognized?

270
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:04,099
I didn't reject you, I just said
I couldn't do it, you know? I'm sorry.

271
00:12:04,099 --> 00:12:07,310
These days,
I was talking to an açaí street vendor.

272
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:09,062
I said, "Hi, how are you?

273
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,943
"Do you deliver açaí...

274
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:19,030
Would you deliver to me?"
It was midnight, you know?

275
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:20,449
Fuck!

276
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:23,452
"Would you deliver to my place?"

277
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:25,370
He said, "Well, I don't know..."

278
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,290
"Do you have a girlfriend?"
He said, "I'm seeing someone."

279
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,708
This is a... You know?

280
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,460
It's just reality.

281
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:44,431
- Guys, the bus is here.
- Let's go. Here we go!

282
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:46,850
- Let's take a picture before?
- Yes.

283
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:49,686
Let's put it on the fridge
with a note for the boys.

284
00:12:49,686 --> 00:12:51,313
- Let's do it.
- Good.

285
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,609
Put all of them together.

286
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:57,944
This one goes a little more
in the back, right?

287
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:01,490
We went to the funk party

288
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:03,825
I wonder if that is going
to cause trouble.

289
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:08,455
Oops. Definitely that is
going to cause trouble.

290
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:11,124
I want to know who they'll meet
at the funk party.

291
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,251
Let's go to the funk party.

292
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,087
We're going to shake our asses.

293
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:19,174
To shake the big ass...
The big ass God gave us.

294
00:13:19,174 --> 00:13:22,177
Guys, how I wish I was
doing that with my friends...

295
00:13:22,177 --> 00:13:24,471
Going out with a drink. I love that vibe.

296
00:13:24,471 --> 00:13:25,555
I love it, too.

297
00:13:25,555 --> 00:13:28,308
- Get in the van already drunk.
- A warm-up at home.

298
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:32,479
Fuck, I love it.

299
00:13:32,479 --> 00:13:34,147
Play it, shake it, shake it

300
00:13:34,147 --> 00:13:36,358
- Is it you? Who?
- No.

301
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:37,442
Tati?

302
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,195
This is very old.
All of her songs are great.

303
00:13:40,195 --> 00:13:44,407
The big drum stopped
Go, go. What the fuck?

304
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:45,992
Can Mariano dance funk?

305
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,077
You're dancing with me.

306
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:48,119
I really dance.

307
00:13:48,537 --> 00:13:50,163
I want to see both of you dancing.

308
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,207
Dance funk rubbing yourself against her...

309
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,543
He knows it... He's dancing.

310
00:13:54,543 --> 00:13:57,420
- What's going on?
- Take it easy. Not here, fellow.

311
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,339
Damn. He knows the moves... Fellow.

312
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:02,968
- Keep going, Mariano.
- Go for it!

313
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:05,512
Move your hips! Move your hips, Mariano!

314
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:06,972
Yeah.

315
00:14:07,597 --> 00:14:10,433
Respect, respect. Respect MS, dude.

316
00:14:10,976 --> 00:14:12,727
- Now you go.
- No, I can't. I can't.

317
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:14,646
Now you. You do know it. Stop it, go!

318
00:14:15,313 --> 00:14:18,775
I don't know, man. I swear to God, fuck.

319
00:14:19,943 --> 00:14:21,528
I don't know how to dance.

320
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:25,448
Titto, you did the move.
Raise your shirt and do it, please.

321
00:14:25,448 --> 00:14:28,827
I've seen you wasted at a funk party.
Shirt off, showing your tush...

322
00:14:28,827 --> 00:14:30,036
Go, you go. Carol!

323
00:14:30,036 --> 00:14:32,247
Can I dance for Carol?

324
00:14:32,247 --> 00:14:33,373
Go, dance for Carol.

325
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:34,457
She's gonna love it.

326
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:36,835
I don't want it to be a funk song.

327
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,503
- Go!
- Then go.

328
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:42,632
Look at her face, just because I'm close.

329
00:14:42,632 --> 00:14:43,717
Go!

330
00:14:43,717 --> 00:14:45,760
Sit straight, Carol, I'll dance for you.

331
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,387
Come, Carol!

332
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:48,555
Oh, my God!

333
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:51,808
What's this, Carol? Are you shy?
Take down your hand.

334
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,560
What's this, Titto?

335
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:58,523
Guys, heavens, that's delicious!

336
00:14:59,274 --> 00:15:02,152
I sensed a smell of ass all of a sudden.

337
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:04,613
She almost had a heart attack with that...

338
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:06,948
We sensed a smell of ass all of a sudden.

339
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,742
It's Carol's. Mine? It's not.

340
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:11,077
Who? Hey little John, what about you?

341
00:15:11,077 --> 00:15:14,122
Bianca farted, she has diarrhea.
It wasn't me.

342
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:16,708
- I know... I dance very well, wait.
- Go, dance!

343
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:18,209
Wait.

344
00:15:20,837 --> 00:15:22,005
Is it for me?

345
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:23,256
Don't stop...

346
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:25,508
No, no, no! No, no, no!

347
00:15:25,508 --> 00:15:26,593
Come, my woman!

348
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:28,094
Dude...

349
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:32,849
Some ass. If you fart in a confetti bag,
Carnival lasts three years, man.

350
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:35,060
Look at the size of his ass.

351
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:36,728
I can say goodbye with my ass.

352
00:15:36,728 --> 00:15:37,646
How is it?

353
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:38,813
This is a water tank.

354
00:15:38,813 --> 00:15:40,857
Talk to me, Pabllo.

355
00:15:40,857 --> 00:15:44,319
Hi, girl. Bye, girl. Bye.
Oh, my God.

356
00:15:44,319 --> 00:15:46,863
If you put a cell phone in the pocket

357
00:15:46,863 --> 00:15:51,701
and you switch sides,
the area code changes, dude.

358
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:55,080
If you put a cell phone in the pocket...

359
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,623
You nailed it, guys.

360
00:15:56,623 --> 00:15:57,957
But I know Bianca can dance.

361
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,585
I'll dance if Pabllo dances.

362
00:16:00,585 --> 00:16:02,629
- Go, Bianca.
- Now the girls, go!

363
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,215
I'm going to dance for Pabllo.

364
00:16:05,215 --> 00:16:09,010
Fuck, fuck, very good fucker

365
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,722
Bianca is a very good fucker

366
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:14,808
Fuck, fuck

367
00:16:16,810 --> 00:16:20,730
If I see Titto at a funk party,
I go like this, "Let me talk to you."

368
00:16:20,730 --> 00:16:25,193
Stay here. Hey, Titto.
Titto, stay there. Carol, stand here.

369
00:16:25,193 --> 00:16:26,444
Titto there and Carol here.

370
00:16:26,444 --> 00:16:28,655
- Let's go.
- Holy shit.

371
00:16:28,655 --> 00:16:31,658
Look at Carol's flirt, pay attention.
Learn it.

372
00:16:31,658 --> 00:16:33,284
I play it like this, look...

373
00:16:34,786 --> 00:16:36,538
- Titto was looking at it.
- Charming.

374
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,331
I'll look this way in a while.

375
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:42,836
Then I pretend I don't want it.
You gotta pretend... You have to value me.

376
00:16:42,836 --> 00:16:44,045
How do you pretend?

377
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:46,506
- I look like this...
- It's a game.

378
00:16:46,506 --> 00:16:48,591
- Pay attention.
- Talk to me.

379
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:50,927
Then he comes, and I say,
"Give me your number."

380
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,597
What if he steals your cell phone?

381
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:55,932
You won't steal, right?

382
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:58,309
What if he steals your cell phone?

383
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:00,353
He's going away with your cell phone.

384
00:17:00,353 --> 00:17:03,398
Then the man gives his number,
no one saw it, no one knows.

385
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:05,108
You hook up with him the next day?

386
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:06,025
Yeah.

387
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,527
You're very patient...

388
00:17:07,527 --> 00:17:08,945
When I'm leaving...

389
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:10,155
You hook up with him in the end?

390
00:17:10,155 --> 00:17:12,073
You don't hook up
with anyone at a party?

391
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,658
In front of everyone?

392
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:14,784
At the funk party...

393
00:17:14,784 --> 00:17:16,161
Has anyone given you a wrong number?

394
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:17,328
"And the flash?"

395
00:17:17,328 --> 00:17:20,039
- No.
- Girl, come here, you make...

396
00:17:20,039 --> 00:17:20,999
You make funk parties...

397
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:22,709
They're at a funk party...

398
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:25,253
they have more chances
of hooking up with someone there?

399
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:29,048
Women hook up with men more than...
Than men hook up with women, dude.

400
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:30,508
Let's test it, Titto.

401
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:31,426
Absolutely.

402
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:33,970
Go to the gate,
let's see who's the first to get laid?

403
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,472
Me or you?

404
00:17:36,598 --> 00:17:37,599
I want to see it.

405
00:17:37,599 --> 00:17:39,517
If I say, "Dude, I want to fuck."

406
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:40,852
He's going to fuck you.

407
00:17:42,854 --> 00:17:45,482
I'll go to the gate now,
look at a woman passing by and say,

408
00:17:45,482 --> 00:17:47,317
"Hey, I need to have sex urgently..."

409
00:17:47,317 --> 00:17:50,904
She'll say you're a perv
and call the police.

410
00:17:50,904 --> 00:17:53,531
He'll say, "I need
someone to pay my credit card."

411
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:57,118
Guys, the bank slips are past due. Who...

412
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,412
- Where's the remote, man?
- Go on, guys!

413
00:18:00,246 --> 00:18:01,414
One for all.

414
00:18:01,414 --> 00:18:05,877
All for one! One for all, all for one!

415
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:07,837
I love it,
that's a girls' night out.

416
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,548
A girls' night out.

417
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,342
Bring that sparkling drink!

418
00:18:12,342 --> 00:18:15,220
"Bring that sparkling drink!"
Haven't I told you?

419
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,137
Sparkles!

420
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,764
Bring that sparkling drink

421
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:18,848
Look, the sparkling drink.

422
00:18:18,848 --> 00:18:20,099
Play it, shake it

423
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,602
I love sparkling drinks at a party.
Don't you?

424
00:18:22,602 --> 00:18:24,270
I love it, sparkling glass.

425
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,273
We have to go to a funk party
with Carol, man.

426
00:18:27,273 --> 00:18:28,858
Jeez, it's my princess dream.

427
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:30,193
I'll go, wearing mini shorts.

428
00:18:30,193 --> 00:18:31,903
I barely went to funk parties.

429
00:18:31,903 --> 00:18:34,781
We have to take Carol
to a Jurerê funk party...

430
00:18:34,781 --> 00:18:37,283
I knew...
I've already written a funk song.

431
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:39,369
Let's see these girls at a funk party.

432
00:18:39,369 --> 00:18:41,871
I've never imagined Mariano doing this.

433
00:18:41,871 --> 00:18:45,291
It's fun. Stop it. You're very fun.

434
00:18:45,291 --> 00:18:47,752
They are really serious at work now.

435
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:48,795
They have to pay for the boat.

436
00:18:48,795 --> 00:18:49,879
Ramon promised.

437
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,175
For those who've never been a waiter...

438
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:57,387
Tell me, did you bring the coolest beer?

439
00:18:57,387 --> 00:18:58,471
The best we have.

440
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:02,517
Come on, it was at the end.

441
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:03,726
This place had to serve tequila.

442
00:19:03,726 --> 00:19:07,522
I wanted it, too.
You have to talk to our manager, Ricardo.

443
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:09,399
There should be tequila for you.

444
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:10,650
I'm talking about you.

445
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,110
If we drink tequila...

446
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:14,612
I'm taking notes
of every tip about parties...

447
00:19:14,612 --> 00:19:15,697
Yeah.

448
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:17,824
- Yeah.
- That's for sure.

449
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:19,158
Four.

450
00:19:19,951 --> 00:19:22,120
Listen to me.
I'm going to leave for a while.

451
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,205
I have some serious business to deal with.

452
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:26,291
- You're responsible for the bar.
- Deal.

453
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,333
I trust you.

454
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:30,628
Ramon is hardworking. Even the owner
of the bar gave him that responsibility.

455
00:19:30,628 --> 00:19:33,423
- I don't think so, okay?
- Don't you?

456
00:19:33,423 --> 00:19:36,175
I think it's a test.
I think he's coming back at half.

457
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:38,261
Here's the thing,
you're going to work,

458
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:40,138
and I'll enjoy a little while he's out.

459
00:19:40,138 --> 00:19:41,931
That's it. We have a deal.

460
00:19:42,056 --> 00:19:43,516
What? Is this real?

461
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:46,352
"I'll enjoy a little while you work."

462
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,229
You'd do the same if you were him.

463
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,314
Are you nuts?

464
00:19:49,439 --> 00:19:50,440
Everyone has to work together.

465
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,609
I would do it. I would tell him...

466
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:54,986
What he said was, "Well, I got the boat.

467
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:56,195
I was a good guy at the ride.

468
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,990
Now you work,
I'm going to enjoy a little."

469
00:19:58,990 --> 00:20:00,283
It's part of the game.

470
00:20:00,283 --> 00:20:02,660
Really, would you do this? What he did?

471
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:04,787
Enjoy and leave your friends working?

472
00:20:04,787 --> 00:20:07,206
Then I'd say to everyone, "Take five."

473
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:10,627
I thought it was wonderful when he said,
"You work, I'm going..."

474
00:20:10,627 --> 00:20:12,962
I'm going to say it.
First, he called to...

475
00:20:12,962 --> 00:20:15,757
Who would call the boss
and ask to borrow his boat?

476
00:20:15,757 --> 00:20:17,300
He had guts,

477
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:20,929
called and set the whole thing up.
He did the PR...

478
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:22,639
Is he not enjoying now? Obviously.

479
00:20:22,639 --> 00:20:25,808
Beside, he's...
Things got complicated with Nathalia.

480
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:27,268
He deserves to have fun.

481
00:20:27,268 --> 00:20:29,187
Just a minute, just a minute.

482
00:20:29,187 --> 00:20:33,066
The boss had to leave
and left me in charge.

483
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:34,484
Haven't I told...

484
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:36,194
What did you ask me
just a while ago?

485
00:20:36,194 --> 00:20:37,528
We want shots!

486
00:20:37,528 --> 00:20:39,405
Anybody else wants shots?

487
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:41,240
- I love Ramon.
- I told you...

488
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:43,576
I don't know. Really, man?
It's not possible.

489
00:20:43,576 --> 00:20:47,038
Man, I guessed right. He raised hell, man.

490
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:48,122
Shot, shot!

491
00:20:48,122 --> 00:20:49,082
What?

492
00:20:49,082 --> 00:20:50,458
Shots for everyone for free.

493
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:53,544
Look how he's cheering,
he's cheering them all.

494
00:20:53,544 --> 00:20:56,214
No, he's giving shots
for everyone for free, man.

495
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:58,299
For free?

496
00:21:01,386 --> 00:21:03,012
Who's going to pay for this?

497
00:21:03,012 --> 00:21:06,766
It's cool those chicks are getting in line
to drink straight from the bottle.

498
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:08,726
Awesome, I used to do that at clubs.

499
00:21:10,269 --> 00:21:13,022
Jeez, bro! Look...
Look at João, he's clueless, man.

500
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:14,232
That's cute.

501
00:21:14,857 --> 00:21:17,318
Bro, he's hooking up
with all the clients, man.

502
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:18,403
Murilo!

503
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:20,947
- No...
- Ramon.

504
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,116
Ramon? He deserves it. He should do it.

505
00:21:23,116 --> 00:21:26,285
- He deserves it.
- At work? That's what you're not getting.

506
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:29,247
He said he loved the other girl
and is taking another one home.

507
00:21:30,206 --> 00:21:31,708
Now we're fucked.

508
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:35,253
First, I want to thank you for the effort.
The bar got happier.

509
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:38,965
Great. I'm gonna let you go earlier
so you can enjoy yourselves.

510
00:21:38,965 --> 00:21:43,344
Okay? That's not all.
There are two things.

511
00:21:43,344 --> 00:21:47,140
The boat ride is expensive, I told you.

512
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:50,018
You're not only paying
for this tonight. Okay?

513
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:51,102
Sure.

514
00:21:51,227 --> 00:21:55,773
I'm having a party at the bar...
Are you seeing this crowd?

515
00:21:55,773 --> 00:21:57,191
I want to double it.

516
00:21:57,191 --> 00:21:59,485
You're going to promote
this party I'm throwing.

517
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,320
- I love PR.
- It's a promoter.

518
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,655
I'm asking the girls for help.

519
00:22:02,655 --> 00:22:04,365
I'll invite the whole island.

520
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:06,075
- Cool?
- Deal, deal.

521
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,201
When is it?

522
00:22:07,201 --> 00:22:08,911
- I'll decide and let you know.
- Okay.

523
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,997
Take it.

524
00:22:10,997 --> 00:22:12,373
Is this going to be wild?

525
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:15,168
The wildest... Now you can go...
You're free to go

526
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:17,587
enjoy the place
because you cheered up the bar.

527
00:22:17,587 --> 00:22:19,797
He gave everyone tequila for free.

528
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:21,799
He'll see it on the surveillance cameras.

529
00:22:21,799 --> 00:22:26,345
Bro, how I wanted to see him cashing out.

530
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:28,181
"Man... Something's wrong."

531
00:22:28,181 --> 00:22:29,599
Guys, he nailed it.
That guy didn't notice.

532
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:31,517
He cheered that bar up
but finished a tequila bottle.

533
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:34,103
- He cheered... But that tequila...
- Nonsense.

534
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,315
Murilo was sensible to say,
"You're giving shots for free."

535
00:22:37,315 --> 00:22:38,232
Yeah, yeah.

536
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:39,400
I'm João Vitor.

537
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,943
You said you were going to kiss her.

538
00:22:40,943 --> 00:22:42,028
What now?

539
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:44,489
João's rejected a lot, man.

540
00:22:44,489 --> 00:22:45,865
You didn't give me tequila anymore.

541
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:46,949
What? You're hot.

542
00:22:47,575 --> 00:22:49,327
You didn't give me tequila anymore.

543
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:54,332
I say no, and a little after, yes.

544
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,417
Guys, what's going on with João?

545
00:22:57,210 --> 00:22:58,294
What?

546
00:22:58,294 --> 00:23:00,171
- What is that?
- Holy fuck!

547
00:23:02,423 --> 00:23:03,424
Guys!

548
00:23:03,883 --> 00:23:06,594
Her girlfriends looked and said,
"Girl, you crazy!"

549
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:10,598
I'll introduce you to the good things.
My room is very top.

550
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:20,650
Do you really like those things?

551
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:22,860
I love it, girl.

552
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:24,862
Where would you rather be?

553
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:27,698
At the funk party with your friends
or hooking up at the bar?

554
00:23:27,698 --> 00:23:29,075
At the funk party, certainly.

555
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:33,538
That depends on the moment.
If I'm in a hooking-up phase, I go for it.

556
00:23:33,538 --> 00:23:36,124
- What about you?
- Funk party with friends, always.

557
00:23:57,770 --> 00:24:00,898
New cast, João took it home...
Twelve women went to the house.

558
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:02,483
The committed people got screwed.

559
00:24:02,483 --> 00:24:03,568
I have terrible news.

560
00:24:03,568 --> 00:24:04,652
They went to the funk party.

561
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:06,779
There's no food.

562
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,656
There is always food. Champagne?

563
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:12,285
I want to give... this to Luan.
"We went to the funk party."

564
00:24:12,285 --> 00:24:14,954
He was going to say something and stopped.

565
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:17,248
They went to the funk party.

566
00:24:18,124 --> 00:24:20,001
He's such a troublemaker. Champagne.

567
00:24:20,001 --> 00:24:23,129
- He's very cool.
- He's very cool, awesome.

568
00:24:24,922 --> 00:24:26,424
I wonder if Luan will blow it.

569
00:24:26,424 --> 00:24:28,593
I wonder if Luan will fuck things up.

570
00:24:29,844 --> 00:24:30,761
Murilo won't.

571
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:34,056
You're the first one to have a sip.

572
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,935
Welcome! You, too, come.

573
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,236
We went to the funk party

574
00:24:47,236 --> 00:24:50,239
Is all of it those girls' fault?
Not coming home?

575
00:24:50,239 --> 00:24:51,866
They'll be really wasted.

576
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:54,952
I wonder what's happening there. No...

577
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,666
Bro, they went to a funk party,
they stayed in their VIP,

578
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:03,419
with a bunch of men dancing all over them.

579
00:25:05,254 --> 00:25:08,049
Look at this, bro.

580
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:10,092
Let's see it.

581
00:25:11,344 --> 00:25:13,012
The boys left those chicks there...

582
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:15,598
Girls go eat and show up at that house.

583
00:25:15,598 --> 00:25:18,226
- I wouldn't get ahead of myself.
- Are you insane?

584
00:25:18,226 --> 00:25:19,727
Is Murilo pissed?

585
00:25:19,727 --> 00:25:21,604
When you say you're cool, you're not.

586
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:22,688
Exactly.

587
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:25,691
If you have to explain that you're cool...

588
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:26,776
Yeah.

589
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:28,861
Murilo went to bed.
He left the hook-ups.

590
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:30,029
I love Murilo.

591
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:31,697
- Oh, my God, what?
- He also...

592
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:33,658
The committed people went to bed.

593
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:37,495
- Oh, my God... Dear Lord.
- The other chick is going to be pissed.

594
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:39,914
The other chick is going to be pissed.

595
00:25:39,914 --> 00:25:40,998
João and Ramão.

596
00:25:41,123 --> 00:25:45,711
What move would you use? Would you hook up
with someone from the house or outside...

597
00:25:45,711 --> 00:25:49,423
I'd hook up with anyone
who wanted me. I don't care.

598
00:25:49,423 --> 00:25:50,633
Who would you be there?

599
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:54,262
I'd be like João, but not...
I wouldn't be friends with anybody.

600
00:25:54,262 --> 00:25:57,682
I'd hook up with one boy,
hook up with another.

601
00:25:57,682 --> 00:26:01,018
I'd wake up, have breakfast,
hook up with another boy.

602
00:26:01,018 --> 00:26:03,229
- You'd be João.
- João is like this, right?

603
00:26:03,229 --> 00:26:05,273
He's not hooking up
with anybody from the house.

604
00:26:05,523 --> 00:26:08,192
- Who would you be in the house?
- João.

605
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:11,195
I'd be Tay. What about you?

606
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:13,781
Tay? I'd be Murilo or Taynara...

607
00:26:14,323 --> 00:26:15,283
What about you, Titto?

608
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:17,660
I have no idea...
I think I wouldn't be.

609
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:19,287
- You have to choose one.
- Me?

610
00:26:19,287 --> 00:26:20,621
Say it.

611
00:26:20,621 --> 00:26:24,375
I can... I'd be Thais, got it? Blondie.

612
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:26,585
Blondie? She doesn't hook up with anyone.

613
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:29,171
- But she's enjoying.
- Bro...

614
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:32,425
Zoom in on his face.

615
00:26:32,425 --> 00:26:34,593
Will you give me a nail file
so I can file my nail?

616
00:26:34,593 --> 00:26:36,804
Would you kiss somebody from the house?

617
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:38,472
Not from the house.

618
00:26:38,472 --> 00:26:39,932
Would you kiss anyone there?

619
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:40,850
Who?

620
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,643
I would kiss on the mouth.

621
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:43,728
Who?

622
00:26:44,312 --> 00:26:45,938
Which one did you like the most?

623
00:26:46,439 --> 00:26:49,942
Man, in the beginning I liked João,
but I don't like men like that...

624
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:52,737
What he showed himself to be.
I like discreet men.

625
00:26:52,737 --> 00:26:54,196
That's true.

626
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,782
I think Murilo seems to be more...

627
00:26:56,782 --> 00:26:58,576
The manager?

628
00:26:58,576 --> 00:27:00,328
The manager is super serious.

629
00:27:00,328 --> 00:27:01,412
Would you kiss the manager?

630
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:02,955
That's true.

631
00:27:02,955 --> 00:27:05,666
Where would you
hook up with him in that house?

632
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:08,961
- In the bathroom, no camera.
- I would do it in the pool.

633
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:11,380
I'd only do it in the bathroom, too.

634
00:27:11,505 --> 00:27:13,299
One step at a time.

635
00:27:17,219 --> 00:27:18,471
Jeez, the high heels...

636
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:20,598
The deck made the high heels get stuck.

637
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:21,682
Thais is like me.

638
00:27:21,682 --> 00:27:24,185
"Forget it.
We'll deal with this tomorrow."

639
00:27:24,185 --> 00:27:26,145
"It's my Schutz shoes, girl."

640
00:27:26,145 --> 00:27:28,314
- Will she catch him in bed?
- She will.

641
00:27:28,314 --> 00:27:29,940
Have some champagne...

642
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:32,777
This heel... There.

643
00:27:32,777 --> 00:27:34,153
I don't know where I'm going.

644
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:35,821
And I'm deluding myself...

645
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,198
Hi, buddy!

646
00:27:37,198 --> 00:27:39,617
She's the best...
Wonderful, guys. Girls...

647
00:27:39,617 --> 00:27:40,701
I'm in, too.

648
00:27:40,701 --> 00:27:44,288
We already visited the lions' room...
How was the night?

649
00:27:44,955 --> 00:27:46,999
Ouch, she's drunk, she's going to...

650
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:50,503
- Jeez, everyone is wasted, man.
- Those people are wasted. Poor girl.

651
00:27:51,712 --> 00:27:53,964
I wish I was like this
with my friends I love.

652
00:27:53,964 --> 00:27:56,467
I want a kiss from my baby.

653
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:59,720
"My baby." She's perfect.

654
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,139
And I'm deluding...

655
00:28:03,349 --> 00:28:04,225
Everyone is wasted.

656
00:28:04,225 --> 00:28:05,893
She's going to catch him, right?

657
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:07,561
They're hunting those chicks.

658
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,355
Ramon is with somebody, easy.

659
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:11,273
"Easy." "Easy."

660
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:12,608
Easy...

661
00:28:14,068 --> 00:28:15,069
Murilo isn't with somebody.

662
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:17,113
I wish she'd arrived
when they were having sex.

663
00:28:17,113 --> 00:28:19,490
Damn, I would be crying a lot right now.

664
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:22,701
Good. You really love me.

665
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:25,287
- I'm not going to look.
- Look. Do you...

666
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:30,334
Look. It was an accident...

667
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,175
I want to talk to Murilo...

668
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:42,221
Yes... Are you sleeping on my bed?

669
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,851
- I can't believe she did that...
- No... I'm telling you, no.

670
00:28:47,685 --> 00:28:51,856
- Jeez, man, that chick is clueless, man.
- I'm shocked with Nathalia's attitude.

671
00:28:51,856 --> 00:28:54,483
- I didn't find it nice.
- Nathalia is totally insane.

672
00:28:54,483 --> 00:28:58,404
She has something that doesn't
exist anymore, she needs good sense.

673
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:02,241
- Yeah, it doesn't. Fuck, she hurt the boy.
- She's ungraceful.

674
00:29:02,241 --> 00:29:06,454
It's like, she may be upset because
he said he loved her yesterday,

675
00:29:06,454 --> 00:29:08,038
but she did something way worse.

676
00:29:08,539 --> 00:29:11,167
- Would you do it?
- Sitting on him? Are you nuts?

677
00:29:11,167 --> 00:29:12,626
Carol and I sitting on a boy...

678
00:29:12,626 --> 00:29:13,711
Would you do it?

679
00:29:13,711 --> 00:29:16,422
I'd say,
"Buddy, put your clothes on, please."

680
00:29:19,717 --> 00:29:20,634
ON THE NEXT EPISODE

681
00:29:20,634 --> 00:29:24,263
Imagine this, I'll put Tay against
the wall and shake on her ass?

682
00:29:25,848 --> 00:29:27,475
That's why I'm single.

683
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:30,352
- I like discreet men.
