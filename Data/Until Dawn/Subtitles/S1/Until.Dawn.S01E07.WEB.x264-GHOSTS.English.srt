00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,000
Fuck.

3
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,720
<i>Three comedians.</i>

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:38,240
- You don't find your faces scary?
- I don't.

5
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,680
<i>A haunted place.</i>

6
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:44,600
<i>Paranormal missions.</i>

7
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,880
It's too much. Way too much!

8
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:48,920
<i>Traps.</i>

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,560
Issa!

10
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,040
<i>Challenges.</i>

11
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,200
In there?

12
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,440
<i>For the most scared...</i>

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,720
Damn!

14
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,440

18

SOMEWHERE IN DORDOGNE...

19
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,480
Here we go!

20
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,000
We're in the middle of a forest
with a lake in front of us.

21
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:29,920
It's scary.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,120
- Fadily?
- Yeah?

23
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,120
What would freak you out the most?

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,880
Honestly, what would freak me out...

25
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,320
would be hearing some noise,

26
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,560
- like footsteps coming toward us.
- Damn!

27
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,720
I don't dare look ahead!

28
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,360
Damn! This is scary as hell.

29
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,880
<i>You're damn right it is.</i>

30
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,040
<i>This is Château-l'Évêque</i>
<i>and its abandoned village.</i>

31
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:10,120
<i>A place form the 14th century,</i>

32
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:13,320
<i>so dark that even moonbeams</i>
<i>struggle to shine through.</i>

33
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,640
<i>And the aim of tonight's game</i>

34
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:17,200
<i>is to face your fears...</i>

35
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,800
- Did you hear that weird noise?
- No, I didn't.

36
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,960
<i>...and to play with other people's fears.</i>

37
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,360
<i>- Issa is already preparing pranks...</i>
- I'm waiting for the girls.

38
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:27,520
I'll try to scare them.

39
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:30,600
<i>...because at dawn, they'll decide</i>
<i>who was the biggest chicken</i>

40
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,960
<i>and punish him or her.</i>

41
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,120
- It's horrible.
- Horrible.

42
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,720
- Wait! You're going too fast!
- Stay with me. Bugs are everywhere.

43
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,720
- It's disgusting.
- I'm panicking.

44
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,600
Fadily, stay with me!

45
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,560
Don't look back.
You know what? We're okay.

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,720
Son of a bitch! An owl!

47
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,120
A freaking owl!

48
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,480
There's an owl in front of us,
blocking our way!

49
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,800
Wait, I hear...

50
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:07,760
I hear the girls already.
They're screaming. This is crazy.

51
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,880
On three, we walk like it's nothing.
One, two, three, let's go.

52
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,800
Fuck!

53
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,800
- Look. They're backing up in a weird way.
- They're gonna fly away.

54
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,520
Did you see how big their wings are?

55
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,920
We're just trying to pass by.
You do what you need to do.

56
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,240
Okay, damn. You've got some balls.

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,280
Okay, Hedwige, what do you say now?

58
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,120
My God! I was so scared.

59
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,800
So now we've managed
to get out of the forest.

60
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,800
Issa?

61
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,080
Issa?

62
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,520
I think it's... It's the truck.

63
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,680
It's the headquarters! Fuck yeah.

64
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:48,000
Fuck! He's getting on my nerves!

65
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,960
- Did you have a good trip?
- He's so childish.

66
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,640
- How's it going, girls?
- We're good.

67
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:53,960
- Yeah.
- Issa?

68
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:56,920
Hey, Issa. We came face-to-face
with two owls.

69
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,880
How are they doing?

70
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,120
- You don't know how freaked out we were!
- No, you don't. We were sweating!

71
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,280
Let's get in the truck.

72
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,280
It's the scariest thing I've done.

73
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,280
<i>This </i>Scooby-Doo<i> van</i>
<i>parked at the castle gates</i>

74
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,000
<i>will serve as their headquarters,</i>

75
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,280
<i>with equipment for the paranormal</i>
<i>missions, such as monitoring screens,</i>

76

77

78
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:21,920
<i>Fadily, let's go.</i>

79
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,520
"A bishop savagely murdered...

80
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:25,920
deadly illnesses,

<i>Which of you will be the most scared?"</i>

83
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,800
If you want to go look around,
I can tell you where to go... from afar.

84
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,240
To be honest, since I saw the owls,
I wouldn't bet on myself.

85
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,600
Just now, I feel Laurie's hand on my arm.

86
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,480

Sis, you're here, and you have to go...
Wait. Where are the bishop's stairs?

102
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,320
All the way over there!

103
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,800

I hear noises.

What do you hear?

121
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:25,120
It's like a door slamming, you know?
A door that wasn't closed properly.

122
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,160
Yeah, but girl, it's windy in there.

<i>And... 50!</i>

129
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,480
<i>Now she must get the stethoscope out</i>
<i>to try and hear the weird noises</i>

131

Monseigneur Fournier...

134
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:01,840
reveal yourself with a noise I can hear
with the stethoscope.

135
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,560
What's happening?

136
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:12,480
So there was a noise,
like something opened...

137
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:20,040
It's not scary when it's quiet,
but as soon as something happens, man,

138
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,480
it feels like my insides drop.

139
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,440
Monseigneur Fournier,

140
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,320
my name is Laurie Peret.

141
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,920
Please don't freak me out.

142
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,880
Be right back.
I'm going to the foot of the tower.

143
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,520
For real, I hear...

144
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,160
noises like cracking...

145
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,960
Monseigneur Fournier, are you there?

146
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,760
I can't get out! It's closed!

147
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,480
Issa!

148
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,800
- Issa!
- Yes, Laurie?

149
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,240
- Open this motherfucking door!
- Hold on.

150
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,760
- Fuck.
- What's going on?

151
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,640
What's up? You're shaking.

152
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,440
THREE HOURS AND 30 MINUTES BEFORE DAWN

153
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:51,680
<i>Issa outdid himself with that.</i>
<i>He slammed the door so discreetly</i>

154
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,520
<i>that he managed to pass as the hero.</i>

155
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,720
- Let me tell you what happened.
- Yeah, tell us.

156
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,080
Upstairs, I could feel a presence,
you know?

157
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,640
I think maybe someone was there.

158
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,920
I ran down the stairs
and the door slammed right in front of me,

159
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,400
and it was impossible to open.

160
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,120
- There was nothing on the cameras.
- You know what happened?

161
00:09:16,960 --> 00:09:18,680
It was you, asshole!

162
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,240
Issa!

<i>what will be worse for the girls:</i>

164
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,400
<i>hunting ghosts or staying with Issa.</i>

165
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,000
- Fadily?
- Yeah?

I have to take the bishop's stairs.
Then go to an attic.

175
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,000
I have to talk to people.

176
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,680
Plus, they say those
who come down get a fever?

177
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,920
This is crazy.

178
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,920
<i>Well, what's really crazy</i>

179
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,800
<i>is knowing all that and still thinking,</i>
<i>"I'm going in, guys."</i>

180
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,000
MISSION 2
THE WASHERWOMEN

181
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:14,120
- Okay, guys. I'm going in.
- <i>Fadily, I'm right here with you.</i>

182
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,120
Come on. Let's go upstairs.
Don't think about it. Just go.

183
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,080
I was acting all tough downstairs,
but I'm scared as hell.

184
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,040
I have to keep going up? Hold on.

185
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:27,080
- <i>Damn!</i>
- What did you find?

186
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,160
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>I thought I saw something move.</i>

187
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,960
- No.
- Go on inside. Turn on the lights.

188
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,080
No, why the hell am I here?

189
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,520
Get the pendulum...

190
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,880
to make contact with the ghosts.

191
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:37,880
<i>Good luck.</i>

192
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:40,840
Don't worry. You got this.

193
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,520
Okay.

194
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,160
Okay, servants and washerwomen...

195
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:51,000
If you're here,
make the pendulum move to my right.

196
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,200
Wait.

197
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,640
She's scared.

198
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:04,360
<i>Hold on. I need to breathe right now.</i>

199
00:11:05,080 --> 00:11:07,600
I swear I'm not making this up.
It moved a little bit.

200
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,120
Okay, are you there?

201
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:12,440
If you are, move to the right.

202
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,920
She's shaking so much, it's crazy.

203
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,960
Yeah.

204
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,960
I feel like crying.

205
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,000
<i>Was the fever the cause of your death?</i>

206
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:32,720
<i>If so, move the pendulum to the right.</i>
<i>If not, to the left.</i>

207
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,840
Damn.

208
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,080
<i>I heard somebody say something!</i>

209
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,640
I'm getting out of here!
I'm done with this! Stop!

210
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,560
I heard somebody say something!

211
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,480
<i>I'm done. I heard somebody talking.</i>

212
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:52,280
Fuck.

213
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,360
Stop it! Fuck! Don't talk to me.

214
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,280
I'm getting out of here. I'm done. Stop.

215
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,960
I'm done for real.

216
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,720
TWO HOURS AND 15 MINUTES BEFORE DAWN

217
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:09,200
- What happened upstairs?
- I swear, at some point, I heard...

218
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:13,160
someone about to speak,
but I didn't let it happen. I left.

219
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,680
Damn, I can't do this.

220
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:18,120
- So you think there was someone upstairs?
- I don't know.

221
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,840
- The pendulum was moving for real?
- It was!

222
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:23,720
<i>As for the competition,</i>
<i>Fadily did exactly like Laurie</i>

223
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,040
<i>and freaked the hell out.</i>

224
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:28,720
<i>Except this time,</i>
<i>Issa had nothing to do with it.</i>

225
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,960
<i>When I told you that this castle was</i>
<i>haunted and no one believed me...</i>

226
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,920
<i>Well, there you go.</i>

227
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:35,080
I think I'm the biggest chicken.

228
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,640
I don't know about that.
I left at the end. I couldn't take it.

229
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:41,080
I think I'm telling on myself right now.

230
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:45,000
<i>For the punishment,</i>
<i>it's basically between the girls.</i>

231
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,440
<i>It's now Issa's turn</i>
<i>to show how brave he is</i>

232
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,160
<i>with tonight's third paranormal mission,</i>

233
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,160
<i>linked to a rather enjoyable legend...</i>

234
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,840
"A few years ago, some new owners
attempted to buy the abandoned castle

235
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,640
to turn it into a hotel.

236
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,600
However, just a few weeks later,

237
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,680
<i>they ran away abruptly</i>
<i>without even taking their belongings.</i>

238
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,480
<i>Since then, strange events</i>
<i>have been occurring in that room.</i>

239
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,800
<i>People have heard noises,</i>

240
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:10,960
<i>and the boxes never stay</i>
<i>in the same place.</i>

241
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,800
Issa, try to make contact
with the ghosts that occupy this room

242
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,000
- to understand why they prevented..."
- You think it's funny?

243
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,080
"...the new owners from moving in
and attack those who enter the castle."

244
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,440
Fuck.

245
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,800
Let's go.

246
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,440
I really hope you shit yourself,
you asshole.

247
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,920
And I'm gonna come close
the door behind you.

248
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,760
If things get out of control,
scream and I swear I'll come running.

249
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,840
What can he scream to...

250
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,400
<i>- Shareh!</i>
- Say it again.

251
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,640
<i>- Shareh!</i>
<i>- Shareh!</i>

252
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,960
It means you're dead.

253
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:44,680
- Let's go, Issa. Good luck.
<i>- Shareh!</i>

254
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:45,960
<i>- Shareh.</i>
- You didn't come.

255
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,120
Can you hear me?

256
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:48,600
Okay, let's go.

257
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,680
MISSION 3
THE ROOM FULL OF BOXES

258
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:55,000
<i>Salaam alaikum, </i>Mr. Ghost.

259
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,320
I don't give a fuck! You can scare me.

260
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,560
I believe in God!

261
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,400
ONE HOUR AND 35 MINUTES BEFORE DAWN

262
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,840
- There's a tower right there on my right.
<i>- That's the one.</i>

263
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,320
- Hello?
- Yeah?

264
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,960
<i>I see the stairs.</i>

265
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:17,520
Well, take the stairs.
It should be on the fourth floor.

266
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,920
<i>Did you enter a room?</i>

267
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,240
<i>- Girls?</i>
- Yeah?

268
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,480
<i>Wallah,</i> I hear sounds.

269
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:34,880
Subhan Allah wallah, <i>on the </i>Quran,
<i>I hear noises.</i>

270
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,560
<i>- Really?</i>
<i>- But what's in front of you?</i>

271
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,120
I'm in a room. There's some old furniture,

272
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,640
- an old TV...
<i>- Keep going.</i>

273
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,000
Keep going inside that room?

274
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:46,120
<i>- Yeah, there are some boxes.</i>
- Are you serious?

275
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,680
Go all the way over there.

276
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,800
- There you go. We see you.
- Go in. It's there.

277
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,840
In there?

278
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:56,080
<i>In this cursed room</i>
<i>located on the second floor,</i>

279
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,800
<i>Issa must contact the spirit</i>

280
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:00,480
<i>said to have pushed the occupants</i>
<i>to leave...</i>

281
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,800
What am I supposed to do?

282
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:03,960
- Put your flashlight and camera down.
<i>- Wait.</i>

283
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,600
Put what down?
I'm not putting anything down.

284
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,240
Get your rods out, Issa.

285
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,120
<i>Hold on, I can hear somebody breathing.</i>

286
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,760
<i>Well, that's not us.</i>

287
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:15,120
I swear on my life...

288
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,360
<i>- We lost the connection.</i>
- Wait. Shut the fuck up!

289
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,920
What should I do now, girls?

290
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,600
<i>Get your rods out.</i>

291
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,000
<i>This is what you have to do.</i>

292
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,760
<i>You touch them together.</i>

293
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:34,720
<i>You take them in your hands.</i>

294
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,520
<i>You're gonna ask if there are</i>
<i>any ghosts haunting the room.</i>

295
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,160
<i>Go ahead.</i>

296
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,120
Spirit...

297
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,000
is anyone in this room? If yes...

298
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,680
make the rods cross.

299
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,120
Hey, please. Do you see that or not?

300
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,920
- We really see it.
- This is out of hand. No.

301
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:13,840
<i>Wallah,</i> I swear to God...

302
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,040
No, this is some crazy shit.

303
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,560
<i>Are you okay?</i>

304
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:29,440
I have tears in my eyes. This is crazy.

305
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,440
Wait.

306
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,760
He's right to be praying.

307
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,680
Spirit...

308
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,640
show me...

309
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,280
where in this room...

310
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:48,360
the spirits are.

311
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:58,480
<i>- What's in front of you?</i>
- There's a box.

312
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,280
- Look in the box.
- What!

313
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,000
- I don't know. Go check it.
- Go look.

314
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,400
- Do you still hear someone breathing?
<i>- I hear breathing.</i>

315
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,960
Breathe, Issa. Breathe.

316
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:19,400
We're gonna tease him after
like he was making fun of us.

317
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:20,680
He was gonna cry.

318
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:26,600
<i>He was making so much fun of us.</i>

319
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:29,720
He was crying like a baby.

320
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:34,800
- Sorry. We're making fun of him.
- Look how he's lifting the boxes.

321
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,960
We have no visual. Issa!

322
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:46,320
<i>- Let go of me!</i>
<i>- Shareh!</i>

323
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,520
<i>Let me go!</i>

324
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,480
<i>- Fucking let go of me!</i>
- Issa?

325
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,520
Let's go. Where is it?

326
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,800
Stay with me, Fadily!

327
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:55,960
Issa!

328
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,440
Issa!

329
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:03,640
FORTY-FIVE MINUTES BEFORE DAWN

330
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,200
It's here.

331
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,720
Issa? We're in the room with boxes.

332
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:11,120
Issa!

333
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,480
- Issa?
- Issa?

334
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:16,200
Where is he?

335
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:23,840
- Hey, don't leave, Fadily.
- Wait.

336
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:25,720
No.

337
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,800
- Fuck.
- Wait.

338
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:33,480
What is this childish shit?

339
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:34,840
There's someone.

340
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,840
Motherfucker!

341
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,880
Honestly, you're so childish.

342
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:48,000
<i>And with that nice prank by Issa,</i>
<i>the sun rises at the Château-l'Évêque.</i>

343
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,880
<i>Who was the biggest chicken of the night?</i>
<i>Who deserves a punishment?</i>

344
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,280
Who was the most scared?

345
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,760
Who was the least scared?
We should start there.

346
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:58,120
I think that's Issa.

347
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:00,560
<i>Okay, Issa freaked out a little bit.</i>

348
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,760
<i>But he mostly</i>
<i>freaked the hell out of the girls.</i>

349
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,160
<i>- Shareh!</i>
- Issa?

350
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,360
<i>So it comes down to Laurie or Fadily.</i>

351
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,920
I'm not gonna lie. I was scared shitless.

352
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:15,920
You were the biggest chicken.

353
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,040
I admit that I was really scared,
but I wasn't the most scared.

354
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,840
- Okay. Now...
- Deliberation.

355
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,360
We're gonna do what I do when I play
Werewolves of Miller's Hollow.

356
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,640
Everyone, put your finger in the air
like this.

357
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:33,240
And on three, you point to who you think

358
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,640
was the most scared tonight.

359
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,680
Three, two, one, point.

360
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,720
It's you, sis. Without a doubt.

361
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,760
Okay, so I suggest...

362
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:46,040
we go back together

363
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:48,880
and you go back in the van.

364
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:50,720
- Alone?
- Yeah.

365
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:54,200
<i>Seriously? Going home in the van?</i>

366
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,760
<i>We expected more from you, Issa.</i>

367
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,120
<i>Well. I guess he still feels guilty</i>
<i>for locking Laurie in.</i>

368
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:09,200
I swear on my mother's life!
Don't do this to me!

369
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:11,120
<i>- Or not.</i>
- You're dogs!

370
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,880
- Laurie, we're out.
- Come on.

371
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,600
Please open the door, Fadily.

372
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,720
Don't leave, guys!

373
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,200
Fadily!
