A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,320
What's happening?

3
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,160
<i>Three comedians.</i>

4
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,960
Mr. and Mrs. Frotier...

5
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:29,880
- Have a son?
- What's his name?

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,920
<i>A haunted place.</i>

7
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:39,960
<i>Paranormal missions.</i>

8
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,560
Alice, are you with us?

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,760
<i>Traps.</i>

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,120
Where is Jason?

11
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,720
<i>That's true. Where is Jason?</i>

12
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,440
<i>Challenges.</i>

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,520
- I dare you.
- Listen. I accept.

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:55,760
We don't dare...

15
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,600
<i>For the most scared...</i>

16
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,160
<i>a punishment.</i>

17
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,240
<i>Sorry. A punishment.</i>

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,120
<i>A game...</i>

19
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,040
<i>that will last...</i>

20
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,480
<i>until dawn.</i>

21
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,240
SOMEWHERE IN LA VIENNE...

22
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,080
- Whose ghost would you like to see?
- Joan of Arc's.

23
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:28,000
Tupac's.

24
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,120
I think Zidane's,
even though he's not dead.

25
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,800
He's so great
that his ghost is already here.

26
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,440
So... "Your destination is

27
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,560
the Château de Fougeret,
one of the most haunted places in France."

28
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,800
<i>Fougeret, a very old castle</i>
<i>from the Middle Ages</i>

29
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,880
<i>with towers that make people freak out,</i>

30
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:53,600
<i>windows that make people freak out,</i>

31
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,400
<i>hallways that make people freak out...</i>

32
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:57,720
<i>In short, it will make you</i>
<i>totally freak out.</i>

33
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,960
<i>I didn't tell you</i>
<i>about the ghosts of the old owners.</i>

34
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,880
<i>Yes, they still occupy</i>
<i>the rooms and everything.</i>

35
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,880
<i>Really. Well, there you go.</i>

36
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,080
"A young girl with a tragic destiny.

37
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:12,280
A couple buried at the bottom of a crypt.

38
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,640
- Stillborns."
- That's not good.

39
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,480
"So many ghosts that you'll no doubt
cross one's path tonight."

40
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,160
- Weird. I'm starting to not feel well.
- I'm sure I won't make it.

41
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:29,000
I'm playing it cool now, but I think...

42
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,040
in an hour, I'll be in tears,
calling for my mother.

43
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,080
<i>Yeah, if you have phone service,</i>
<i>given the place...</i>

44
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,320
<i>I doubt it!</i>

45
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,640
MIDNIGHT - SIX HOURS BEFORE DAWN

46
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,640
I can't see anything. <i>Bismillah.</i>

47
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,600
<i>Tonight, the goal of the game</i>

48
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,400
<i>is to face your fears...</i>

49
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:55,000
If I see something sketchy,
I'm gonna abandon my teammates.

50
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,640
<i>And play with the others.</i>

51
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,280
I believe in spirits.

52
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,360
It's better to annoy Tania and Hakim.

53
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:04,400
I prefer pissing them off
over the spirits.

54
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:09,160
<i>At dawn, our three friends</i>
<i>will decide who was the most scared.</i>

55
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,000
<i>And for that person, a prize...</i>

56
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:12,680
<i>the...</i>

57
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,920
<i>punishment!</i>

58
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,520
<i>Yeah, that's it. That's what we said.</i>

59
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:19,800
<i>I think Hakim is a real chicken,</i>

60
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:22,640
<i>so I'm putting all my eggs in that basket.</i>

61
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:25,320
- I see the castle.
- Shit!

62
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,560
Something definitely lives there.

63
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:29,800
Yeah, fuck.

64
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,120
- Are you ready?
- Let's go. <i>Bismillah.</i>

65
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:36,520
Okay, welcome to the house of crazies.

66
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,600
<i>Inside, surveillance cameras,</i>

67
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,080
<i>three floors,</i>

68
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:44,000
<i>20 rooms that have been uninhabited</i>
<i>since last century,</i>

69
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:46,440
<i>antique decor,</i>

70
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:48,960
<i>all very scary.</i>

71
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,120
- Where is Jason?
- That asshole.

72
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,120
Fuck, get your light.

73
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,400
- I'm not letting go of you.
- Okay. Where's Jason?

74
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,680
No...

75
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,760
From the start, man!

76
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,000
Actually, we entered the house,

77
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,120
and I left straightaway. I left them.

78
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,160
And they're panicking
since they didn't see me leave.

79
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:12,360
<i>Jason's hiding out on the second floor.</i>

80
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,440
<i>Tania and Hakim are still looking for him</i>
<i>on the first floor.</i>

81
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,720
<i>Fortunately, we can count on Tania</i>
<i>to stay calm.</i>

82
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,440
- Did you hear that?
- Fuck!

83
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,880
They're panicking.

84
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,080
- Where was it?
- It was up there.

85
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,480
Go. He's up there.

86
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,440
That asshole is hiding somewhere for sure.

87
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,960
Wait, don't move.

88
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,400
Did you hear that?

89
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:49,920
I didn't see that doll. Fuck.
It wasn't there before.

90
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,360
It wasn't there before, was it?

91
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,200
Were you there before or not?

92
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,640
It's horrible. God forgive us.

93
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,960
Wait. No, wait.

94
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,200
Wait, Tania. Stay with me.

95
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,120
You're such an asshole!

96
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,480
Man, you went too far.

97
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,920
That's not cool, seriously. You're gonna
pay. I won't let you off easy.

98
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,480
FIVE HOURS AND 12 MINUTES
BEFORE DAWN

99
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,360
<i>Jason started the animosity</i>
<i>for tonight's competition.</i>

100
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,560
<i>In order to chase ghosts,</i>
<i>the trio has a headquarters.</i>

101
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,640
<i>They have</i>
<i>all the necessary equipment there</i>

102
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,440
<i>for their paranormal missions,</i>
<i>such as surveillance monitors,</i>

103
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,120
<i>walkie-talkies, etc.</i>

104
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,880
<i>Okay, guys.</i>

105
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,720
So... "Mission one: the crypt." Fuck.

106
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,120
This is starting off well.

107
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,360
"Château de Fougeret's crypt is buried
tens of meters below the surface.

108
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:56,320
It has served as a tomb for centuries."

109
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,080
Fuck. There must be 10,000 dead.

110
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,720
"You can particularly get in contact
with Mr. and Mrs. Frotier,

111
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,960
who were some of the castle's
first owners.

112
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,000
They've haunted the crypt for centuries.

113
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,760
Goal of the mission:
go into the depths of the castle alone

114
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,560
and get in contact
with its first occupants.

115
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:15,000
The chosen one: Tania Dutel.
Take your flashlight and two pods."

116
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,600
That's you!

117
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,840
Frankly, I swear that's not cool.

118
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,080
What are pods?

119
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,360
<i>Pods:</i>

120
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:25,680
<i>presence detectors that flash and beep</i>
<i>before a ghost.</i>

121
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,000
<i>There you go. Like that.</i>

122
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,680
Everyone take a walkie-talkie
to communicate. Here, Tania.

123
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,840
- How do I know where the crypt is?
- It's there. Look.

124
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,200
"Hall" and there's a staircase there.

125
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,360
MISSION ONE
THE FROTIER CRYPT

126
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,480
- Can you hear us?
- No, there's static.

127
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:44,560
Go down.

128
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,320
Honestly, it's gonna be hard
to do what she's doing.

129
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,640
Well, I'm in the dark.

130
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,920
<i>To contact the Frotier couple,</i>
<i>you have to put the pods on the ground.</i>

131
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,640
<i>But the best way to get the spirits</i>
<i>to come is in the dark.</i>

132
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,560
- Tania?
- Tania, turn the light off.

133
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,680
No!

134
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:19,560
- No, fuck!
- There are rules!

135
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,120
Can I light a candle for light?

136
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:26,720
<i>- Do you have a lighter?</i>
- There are matches.

137
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,920
- Yeah, go ahead. Light the candle.
- Yeah.

138
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,040
Shit.

139
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,000
<i>It's okay. Take you're time.</i>

140
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,720
<i>- Take your time. Stay calm.</i>
- This is ridiculous.

141
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,160
Okay.

142
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,320
Okay.

143
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,080
- Mr. and Mrs. Frotier...
- Have a son.

144
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,320
What's his name?

145
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,320
I have no ill intentions towards you.

146
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,680
I love ghosts,

147
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:56,320
<i>and I'd be super happy</i>
<i>if we could talk.</i>

148
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,280
So, I'm honestly not here to bother you.
I swear.

149
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,640
My friends are up there watching.

150
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,480
So, there you go. Are we welcome
or do you want us to run away?

151
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,520
Tania? We have to turn off
the walkie-talkies, okay?

152
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,200
- No!
<i>- We see you. Listen!</i>

153
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,920
<i>They'll be more likely to make contact</i>
<i>if we turn them off.</i>

154
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,240
Once those are off,
you must blow out the candle.

155
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,520
No, I don't want to do that!

156
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:31,720
<i>Don't worry.</i>
<i>They'll understand that you're friendly.</i>

157
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,320
It's just so they can appear.
You have nothing to worry about.

158
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,320
Everything's fine.

159
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,400
There can't be any radio waves.
Otherwise, it won't work.

160
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:40,960
- Come on. See you soon.
- Okay.

161
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,200
Friendship.

162
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,640
Mr. and Mrs. Frotier,

163
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,960
I present myself.

164
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:01,600
Did you close it? No?

165
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:02,960
- Yes.
- Shit!

166
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:08,360
What else can I tell you?
I have an older sister and two brothers.

167
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,920
And so...

168
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,240
Well, they're nice.

169
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,400
Do you want us to leave,
Mr. and Mrs. Frotier?

170
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,480
What's happening?

171
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:36,960
Leave, Tania.

172
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,120
No!

173
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,200
<i>What's happening?</i>

174
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:45,200
Fuck...

175
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,160
<i>- Is the gate closed?</i>
- Yes.

176
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,640
<i>Shit!</i>

177
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,680
As if you didn't know!

178
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,080
Fuck.

179
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:56,720
Go, Tania. Get out!

180
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:59,440
<i>- I'm completely serious. Hurry.</i>
- Stop!

181
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,200
FOUR HOURS AND SIX MINUTES
BEFORE DAWN

182
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,880
<i>- First contact in the crypt.</i>
<i>- Success.</i>

183
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,040
<i>Well, success...</i>

184
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,080
<i>to be determined</i>
<i>since the beeps said, "Leave."</i>

185
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,520
<i>Well, we've lasted the night.</i>

186
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:12,920
<i>We're not quitting now.</i>

187
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,720
- Did you see what happened?
- It was too far. How'd you do it?

188
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,360
- You told the ghosts your life story.
- I was trying to...

189
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:21,440
- Honestly, I was scared.
- Locking the gate went too far.

190
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,480
- Did you do that?
- No, it was Mrs. Frotier.

191
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:24,880
- I kind of know her.
- Right.

192
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,360
<i>And now for the "beep beep."</i>

193
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,840
<i>Yes, it's a "beep beep."</i>

194
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,080
<i>- And the false imprisonment...</i>
- No!

195
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,200
<i>Jason and Hakim are off to a good start.</i>

196
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:36,920
<i>If Tania doesn't get moving,</i>

197
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:40,040
<i>she risks losing.</i>

198
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,920
I'm so gonna get back at them.

199
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,000
It's gonna be crazy.

200
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:46,920
<i>At the start of the night,</i>

201
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,720
<i>Hakim showed Tania something</i>
<i>that rubbed him wrong.</i>

202
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,000
I didn't see that doll. Fuck.
It wasn't there before.

203
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,640
It wasn't there before, was it?

204
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:58,920
<i>Yeah, dolls aren't Hakim's thing.</i>

205
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:02,640
<i>And it's funny,</i>
<i>because on the second floor,</i>

206
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,120
<i>there's this room.</i>

207
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,120
- Hakim?
- Yeah?

208
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:10,880
You locked me downstairs. So now,
you will have to go into the doll room

209
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,800
and do a show in front of the dolls
while we watch from here.

210
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,320
Can you do it or not?

211
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:18,200
Listen, I think I can do it.

212
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,160
- I can do it.
- Go on. Improvise for us.

213
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,120
And I want to laugh.

214
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,840
VENGEANCE

215
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,760
Fuck, this is freaky.

216
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,600
I have to do a show in front of the dolls.

217
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,960
To be honest, I'm not happy.

218
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,240
I don't know how it's gonna go.

219
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:45,920
I'm really freaking out.
Imagine if the dolls laugh.

220
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,440
<i>Ladies and gentle-dolls, good evening.</i>

221
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,920
Welcome to the Hakim Jemili Show.

222
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,040
We'll start by clapping a shitload...

223
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,120
for Mr. Hakim Jemili!

224
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,160
<i>Good evening.</i>

225
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,680
Are there any doll couples?

226
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,840
First dig.

227
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,880
I'm going to scare him.

228
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,720
- Fuck!
<i>- Hello, dolly.</i>

229
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,840
Hello, you.

230
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:20,840
Your dress is beautiful!

231
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,480
Are you the gold-digger doll?

232
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,360
Is that it?

233
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,080
Hello, little doll.

234
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,440
Well, you...

235
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,640
You're seated. You're good.

236
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,800
You're watching the show quietly.

237
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:41,200
<i>Why is her mouth so open?</i>

238
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,280
Hakim is in the doll room.

239
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,480
He's doing a show.

240
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:47,480
I know this. The rhythm's missing.

241
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:51,240
I'm gonna add a little rhythm to his show.
I'm gonna scare the shit out of him.

242
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:54,160
Today, I'm gonna present
two of your friends,

243
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,000
who you know.

244
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,440
Here. To my left, Adeline.

245
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,360
To my right...

246
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,080
Fuck, this fucking one is scary!

247
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,960
Fuck!

248
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,680
He had a heart attack!

249
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,640
<i>Doll: one...</i>

250
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,760
<i>Jason: one.</i>

251
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,360
<i>Hakim: zero.</i>

252
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:19,240
<i>Judging who's the winner</i>
<i>is getting hard, Hakim.</i>

253
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,200
At this rate, we're gonna wake people up.

254
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,840
- Obviously.
<i>- Are you coming?</i>

255
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,160
Are we doing another mission
or do we keep going?

256
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:28,120
THREE HOURS AND 18 MINUTES
BEFORE DAWN

257
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,960
"The room of the masters
is the biggest room in the castle.

258
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,360
The owner's wife
had several miscarriages there.

259
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,880
Numerous paranormal occurrences
have been observed in the past,

260
00:13:37,960 --> 00:13:40,040
notably recordings of a baby crying.

261
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:43,360
<i>Jason's mission:</i>
<i>pick up these paranormal noises.</i>

262
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:47,880
<i>If contact is effective,</i>
<i>it should calm the spirits of the babies.</i>

263
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,240
<i>But maybe he'll be the one</i>
<i>who needs reassurance...</i>

264
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,840
<i>because Jason doesn't seem his best.</i>

265
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,080
It's really starting to get dark here.

266
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,840
MISSION TWO
ROOM OF THE MASTERS

267
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,200
Okay, kids, it's your uncle.

268
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,600
We don't know each other,
but rest assured...

269
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,680
It'll be all right, okay?
Everything's all right.

270
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,560
<i>The technique for picking up</i>
<i>the baby spirits' cries</i>

271
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,560
<i>involves placing a baby monitor</i>
<i>in the crib...</i>

272
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:20,880
<i>and then leaving quietly.</i>

273
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,720
<i>- Jason, did you hear something?</i>
<i>- I don't hear anything.</i>

274
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,720
<i>Be patient. Like those who come</i>
<i>to see your shows.</i>

275
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,040
At least people come to see me.

276
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,440
<i>No paranormal activity at the moment.</i>

277
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,600
<i>Tania?</i>

278
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,560
<i>A little vengeance, no?</i>

279
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:58,360
I just got out the baby monitor,
and I'm gonna start making baby noises.

280
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,560
They're real noises
and you'll be a little scared.

281
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:03,920
<i>Yes, since Tania</i>

282
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,880
<i>took the second baby monitor</i>
<i>from Jason's bag.</i>

283
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,760
<i>Little devil.</i>

284
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:20,000
- I hear them crying.
- You hear them?

285
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,000
There are some weird noises.

286
00:15:24,080 --> 00:15:27,080
I don't know if they're babies or what,
but there are weird sounds.

287
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,080
Like I said, I absolutely don't want
to look for spirits, babies or adults.

288
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,960
- I don't hear anything now.
- Okay.

289
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:43,640
I'm sure there are noises.
I don't know where they're coming from,

290
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,520
but they're there. I'm leaving quietly.

291
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,640
<i>For a guy who was supposed to reassure</i>
<i>the spirits of the babies,</i>

292
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,840
<i>I feel like saying, "Well done, champion."</i>

293
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:52,960
ONE HOUR AND 43 MINUTES
BEFORE DAWN

294
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,240
<i>The night goes on and so does</i>
<i>the competition. Tania isn't very hungry.</i>

295
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,680
- Cake?
- No, thanks.

296
00:15:57,760 --> 00:15:58,800
<i>I told you.</i>

297
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,080
<i>And she knows that at dawn,</i>
<i>a punishment awaits the most scared.</i>

298
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,520
- Ready?
- Yeah.

299
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,720
The story...

300
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:08,600
"Alice was the niece of one
of the owners of the castle.

301
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,960
She was part of the <i>jeunesse dorée</i>
during the 1920s

302
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,600
and always vacationed at Fougeret.

303
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:15,960
In July of 1924, she fell seriously ill
from a respiratory infection

304
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:16,960
and died at age 22.

305
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:23,080
Her body was taken to her room
at Fougeret to be looked after.

306
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,360
Ever since,
she often appears in that room.

307
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:28,120
Goal of the mission:

308
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,760
use the Ouija board
to get in contact with Alice."

309
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,240
MISSION THREE
ALICE'S ROOM

310
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,240
Should we get on the ground?
I think it's with two fingers,

311
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,360
but I don't know if we both use both hands
or just one each.

312
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:50,040
First let's reassure her
by saying that we're here to...

313
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,240
What are we doing?

314
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,960
We're gonna talk to her.
So we're gonna say, "Alice...

315
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:56,200
are we welcome in your bedroom?"

316
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,840
Don't push it, guys.

317
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,400
- We're not.
- Okay.

318
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,400
Alice, if you hear us, are you here?

319
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,400
Alice, if you hear us...

320
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,280
tell us you're here in the room.

321
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,360
Is our presence bothering you, Alice?

322
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:27,480
I'm starting to feel weird.

323
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,520
My heart's beating like crazy.

324
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:31,000
I swear.

325
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,600
I've had a feeling
in the pit of my stomach from earlier.

326
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:38,040
- Because you ate too much.
- No, it's not...

327
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,520
It's in my rib cage.

328
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,520
Tania? What's going on?

329
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,440
- What's up with you?
- Are you okay?

330
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:00,360
What's up?

331
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,000
What's up?

332
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,200
Hey, Tania, what's up with you?

333
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,920
What's up?

334
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,760
- You're freaking me out!
- Tania, careful.

335
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:16,400
Tania.

336
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:18,640
- Hey, hey.
- Take it slow.

337
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:21,960
Hey, hey.

338
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,640
Look at me! Look at me, Tania.

339
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,640
Look at me!

340
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,120
Tania! Stop crying!

341
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,120
Calm down. We're here.

342
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,440
Calm down.

343
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,600
It's Jason. Everything's fine.

344
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,560
- I know.
- Fuck! Fucking shit.

345
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:36,480
Okay.

346
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,720
All right. That's done.

347
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,640
Alice, if you hear us...

348
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,840
Are you with us in this room?

349
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,280
Alice, show yourself one way or another.

350
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,840
Alice...

351
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:17,040
My God!

352
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:19,880
Come on. Let's get out of here.

353
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,800
Fuck! What happened?

354
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:25,720
I will never set foot in that room again.

355
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,640
Guys, what happened was crazy.

356
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,800
The noises made me freak out. I swear.

357
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,240
And the thing moved. Holy shit.

358
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,400
16 MINUTES BEFORE DAWN

359
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,200
<i>The sun is rising</i>
<i>over Château de Fougeret.</i>

360
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,560
<i>It's time for Tania, Hakim, and Jason</i>

361
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,600
<i>to decide who was</i>
<i>the most scared last night</i>

362
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,080
<i>and make that person endure...</i>

363
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,520
<i>the punishment!</i>

364
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,160
<i>So who, what, when?</i>

365
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,800
<i>The time is now!</i>

366
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:55,240
- What's the punishment?
- The crypt.

367
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,160
The crypt.

368
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,160
The only thing is
that I did the crypt alone,

369
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,640
in the dark.

370
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,840
If anyone deserves to see the sun rise...

371
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,960
- No, really...
- I can't leave Tania.

372
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,080
I won't leave without her.

373
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:11,320
So you're gonna have to stay.

374
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,000
- I have to stay?
- Yeah.

375
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,120
I won't leave without Tania either.

376
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,520
<i>No one wants to go into the crypt.</i>

377
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,440
<i>Overall, if we recap the night...</i>

378
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,520
<i>Tania freaked out.</i>

379
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,360
<i>Hakim freaked out.</i>

380
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,080
<i>Jason freaked out.</i>

381
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,480
<i>In short, all three freaked out.</i>

382
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,800
<i>What do we do in the case of a tie?</i>

383
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,320
All three of us go, guys!

384
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:40,360
- Come on. Let's go.
- Are you coming with us?

385
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,600
Yes, I'm gonna go with you.

386
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,000
THE PUNISHMENT

387
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,360
Fuck, that's scary.

388
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,880
- Come with me.
- Don't worry. I swear...

389
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,320
I'm a friend.

390
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:51,640
You went down there?

391
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,200
- Further down?
- Yeah, I went down there, guys.

392
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,360
You did that alone?

393
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,880
- Yeah, I did it alone.
- You're completely insane.

394
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,600
- I did this all alone, guys.
- It's crazy slippery.

395
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,760
- You're a trooper to have gone alone.
- Did you see?

396
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,680
I wouldn't have done it alone.
I'll tell you that.

397
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:10,880
Hakim, you locked me in earlier.

398
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,800
Tania, we didn't vote against you.
Fuck! Open up!

399
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:15,440
Tania, that's not funny! The key!

400
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,440
Tania!

401
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,800
I think we can say that I won.

402
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,280
Tania!

403
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:25,680
Tania!

404
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,520
Are there mice on the ground?

405
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,080
- Are those edible?
- You'd really have to be hungry.

406
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:33,360
Tania!
