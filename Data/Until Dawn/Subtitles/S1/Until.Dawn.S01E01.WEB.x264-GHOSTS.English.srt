A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,000
Ahmed!

3
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,560
Ahmed!

4
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,280
<i>Three comedians.</i>

5
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,880
It stinks like an old, musty man in here.
It's terrible.

6
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:37,640
It's totally organic!

7
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,000
<i>A haunted place.</i>

8
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:42,760
Fuck!

9
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,000
<i>Paranormal missions.</i>

10
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:46,640
Mr. Guardian, I'm listening to you.

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:47,680
<i>Traps.</i>

12
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,280
<i>Challenges.</i>

13
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:53,000
You don't get it. I'm a coward.
I'm not into this shit.

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:54,600
I don't feel well.

15
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:55,920
<i>For the most scared...</i>

16
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,320
<i>a punishment!</i>

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,280
<i>A game that's going to last...</i>

18
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,520
<i>until dawn.</i>

19
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,560
SOMEWHERE IN A FOREST
IN THE JURA MOUNTAINS...

20
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,840
I don't know where we're going.

21
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,680
Look!

22
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,200
- What is it?
- I'm kidding!

23
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,400
Are you crazy?

24
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:43,360
You're already starting?

25
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:49,360
- Ahmed, I slipped.
- What did you slip on?

26
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,720
A rock.

27
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:52,640
Yeah, I slipped on a rock.

28
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,600
Wait. I got a little map in my pocket.

29
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,680
- Look what's written! "Val Monastery."
- Yeah.

30
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,320
So it's straight ahead.

31
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,280
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

32
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,160
<i>One kilometer straight ahead,</i>

33
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,680
<i>and there is the Val Monastery,</i>

34
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,720
<i>built in the 17th century.</i>

35
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,920
<i>Mysterious disappearances...</i>

36
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,600
<i>and a defiled tombstone</i>
<i>still resides there.</i>

37
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,160
Don't start telling me about weird stuff
like tombs...

38
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,480
You're all crazy.
You shouldn't mess with that.

39
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,880
<i>Don't worry, Ahmed.</i>
<i>Everything will be okay.</i>

40
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,240
<i>Today, the place is used</i>
<i>as a peaceful sanctuary</i>

41
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,440
<i>for whoever wants to be</i>
<i>cut off from the world.</i>

42
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,720
<i>The world of the living.</i>

43
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,320
<i>Because, as for ghosts...</i>
<i>that's not certain.</i>

44
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,040
I'm very excited at the moment,

45
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,080
but I don't think we'll be laughing
once we get there.

46
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,520
<i>You don't say.</i>

47
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:51,600
<i>In this monastery from hell,</i> <i>the goal</i>
<i>of tonight's game is to play with fear...</i>

48
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,920
Turn your lights on!
Don't leave me behind either!

49
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,480
- There's a flashlight!
- So turn yours on!

50
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,560
Why are you making people nervous?

51
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,360
<i>...and play with the fears of others.</i>

52
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:03,680
I have firecrackers in my pocket.
I'm gonna drive them nuts.

53
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,000
<i>At dawn, they'll decide</i>
<i>who was the biggest chicken</i>

54
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,400
<i>to make them suffer a punishment.</i>

55
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,520
Fuck! What was that?

56
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:13,400
What is that?

57
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,760
<i>And in this competition,</i>
<i>Alban has already chosen his target.</i>

58
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,360
I think Ahmed is
the team's biggest chicken.

59
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,560
He's gonna have
a lot of surprises tonight.

60
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,240
What is this?

61
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,680
No, Alban, this isn't funny at all.

62
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:34,440
This place is fucking huge!

63
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,400
This isn't funny at all.

64
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,720
I absolutely don't want to be scared.
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing here.

65
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:47,120
- Guys, I feel like this is gonna...
- We can still go back.

66
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,280
MIDNIGHT - SIX HOURS BEFORE DAWN

67
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,040
<i>Four floors,</i> <i>an attic, a cellar, a chapel,</i>

68
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,920
<i>dozens of hallways, and some dorms.</i>

69
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,480
<i>In this worrisome labyrinth, cameras</i>
<i>have been placed just about everywhere</i>

70
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,160
<i>and are ready to record</i>
<i>anything strange that might happen.</i>

71
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,720
Yeah, they locked the doors.

72
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,880
I get the impression
we're gonna sleep here.

73
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:24,320
<i>Yeah, but the goal tonight is not</i>
<i>to sleep, but to hunt for ghosts.</i>

74
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,000
<i>So, let's go to the headquarters,</i>

75
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:28,920
<i>where all the equipment</i>
<i>for the paranormal missions awaits.</i>

76
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,160
<i>So, we're well-behaved</i>
<i>and we knock before going in.</i>

77
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,400
Some light!

78
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,200
Damn! This is our HQ!

79
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,240
That means we can chill out here.

80
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,800
<i>And the ghosts</i>

81
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,440
<i>We'll go looking for them downstairs...</i>

82
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,920
<i>- And the spirits!</i>
<i>- And the spirits!</i>

83
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,520
<i>- And the ghosts!</i>
<i>- And the ghosts!</i>

84
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,360
<i>- They're over here!</i>
<i>- They're over here!</i>

85
00:04:54,440 --> 00:05:00,640
<i>How we laugh!</i>

86
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,840
With that, buddy,

87
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,720
the spirits and ghosts

88
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,120
are gonna want to party, not attack us.

89
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,880
<i>Yeah, right...</i>

90
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,160
<i>Well, Ahmed doesn't know what awaits him</i>

91
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,680
<i>with tonight's first paranormal mission.</i>

92
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,000
So, what does it say?

93
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,960
"In the monastery's dorm,

94
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:20,240
there's been a lot of laughter,
but also a lot of crying.

95
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,520
It's up to you to go meet the children

96
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,760
that still haunt this place."

97
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,360
"Ahmed, try to comfort them."

98
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,040
"Take the teddy bears
equipped with presence detectors.

99
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,840
If they ring,
it means you're not alone in the room.

100
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,000
Take the opportunity
to sing them a lullaby."

101
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,280
MISSION ONE
THE CURSED DORM

102
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,280
<i>The children of Val...</i>
<i>According to legend,</i>

103
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:51,160
<i>young orphans taken in by the monastery</i>
<i>mysteriously disappeared.</i>

104
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:54,800
<i>Between the strange noises</i>
<i>and the detectors that could go off,</i>

105
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,920
<i>we're not sure Ahmed is ready</i>
<i>for a paranormal encounter.</i>

106
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,080
Guys, I swear to God, I hear noises.

107
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,040
- What am I supposed to do now?
- You have to set up the teddy bears.

108
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,760
Wait, I can't hear you.

109
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,680
- Can you hear us?
<i>- There's static.</i>

110
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:20,960
I can't hear you!

111
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,960
- You missed it. The closet moved.
- No, stop.

112
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,200
I swear it did.

113
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,280
Go check in the closet on the left.

114
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,200
- What do you mean the closet on the left?
<i>- We saw something weird over there.</i>

115
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,760
I'm not playing.

116
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,200
I swear to God,
I'm gonna hit whatever it is.

117
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,240
Is anybody there?

118
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,800
Okay. There's nothing there.

119
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,000
Really look inside. Put your hands in.

120
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,880
I'm not gonna put my hands in!
Nothing's there. You're breaking my balls!

121
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:06,240
<i>- The third...</i>
- Nothing!

122
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,040
It's the third closet
that opened itself earlier.

123
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,760
- Fuck!
<i>- I know.</i>

124
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,480
- Come on!
- That one.

125
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,720
<i>- Nothing. Just some comforters.</i>
- Look inside the comforter.

126
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,360
- Nothing. Just some comforters.
- Okay.

127
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:31,080
- Weird.
- What should I do?

128
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,360
<i>For starters, let's calm down</i>

129
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:36,400
<i>and let's set up</i>
<i>the teddy bear presence detectors.</i>

130
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:39,760
<i>Their sensors will sound</i>
<i>if some spirits come along.</i>

131
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:42,080
<i>You need to turn off your light.</i>

132
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,760
You're insane.

133
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:46,760
<i>Okay, perfect. You rock.</i>

134
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:54,920
<i>Now you need to call</i>
<i>the souls of the children.</i>

135
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,560
<i>I'm gonna give you their names.</i>

136
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,840
<i>Jean, Pierre, Hugues, and Martin.</i>

137
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,960
I swear, you're starting to drive me nuts
with your crazy missions.

138
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,320
Jean, Pierre, Hugues, Martin...

139
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,640
if you're here, guys...

140
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,520
Jean, Pierre, Hugues, Martin...

141
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,320
Jean, Pierre, Hugues, Martin,
do you want me to sing you a song?

142
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,920
Wow.

143
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,360
Wow!

144
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,400
Wow!

145
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,280
Are you fucking with me right now?

146
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,080
Motherfucker!

147
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,560
Motherfucker!

148
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,960
Fuck, Mommy...

149
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,440
Mommy...

150
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,960
Fuck!

151
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,080
I wanna stop.

152
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,720
I'm out of here.

153
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:21,480
I think I found the valve
that activates all the sinks,

154
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,360
so we're gonna give him a little surprise.

155
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,080
<i>Jingle bells, jingle bells</i>
<i>Jingle all the way</i>

156
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,240
- The water's running, fuck!
- Wash your hands.

157
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,280
Fuck you!

158
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:46,960
Poor guy.

159
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,360
<i>- Careful on the stairs.</i>
- Shut up!

160
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,720
Fuck!

161
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,680
You assholes!

162
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,840
- You assholes!
- Damn.

163
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,400
You assholes!

164
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,920
- It wasn't us!
- What's going on?

165
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,840
The thing turned on by itself!
Feel me, bro.

166
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,120
- I'm gonna die.
- No, relax.

167
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,080
I'm gonna die.

168
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,320
No, I'm done.

169
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,200
All the faucets went on at once?

170
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:11,960
- What was that?
- The faucets suddenly went on.

171
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,600
I swear to God, I heard water running
in the dark. It went click-click.

172
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,200
You don't know where it was from?

173
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,680
- I left everything there.
- Yeah, I know.

174
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:22,560
- We saw.
- I left everything.

175
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,000
- You gotta go back and get it.
- What?

176
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,640
It's better to buy new teddy bears.

177
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:32,040
<i>Okay, we're making a note</i>
<i>to charge Ahmed for a teddy bear.</i>

178
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,520
<i>It was a limited edition.</i>
<i>It cost a fortune.</i>

179
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,040
Honestly, chill.

180
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,560
- Let me catch my breath.
- Give him a couple minutes.

181
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,400
<i>But what could be problematic for him</i>

182
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:43,480
<i>is the punishment</i>
<i>that awaits the biggest chicken...</i>

183
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,160
<i>unless he gets revenge.</i>

184
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,920
FOUR HOURS AND 32 MINUTES BEFORE DAWN

185
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,480
So, what does it say?

186
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,480
"The haunted chapel. Alban...

187
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,360
you're going alone to the chapel
adjacent to the monastery.

188
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,280
<i>To announce your presence there,</i>

189
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,120
<i>you should make contact</i>
<i>with the Lord of Varambon,</i>

190
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:04,080
founder of the Val Monastery."

191
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:08,080
His tomb is protected nowadays
since it's been desecrated many times.

192
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,120
Take the note in Latin with you.
You're going to need it."

193
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,320
Let's go, fam.

194
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,480
Let's go, bro.

195
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,120
- Fuck.
- I'm out of here.

196
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:24,200
- Alban, you're so brave.
- Yeah, yay.

197
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,840
Fucking monastery.

198
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,880
MISSION TWO
THE DESECRATED TOMB

199
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:30,200
<i>Good luck, Alban!</i>

200
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,000
<i>Because contacting a spirit</i>
<i>whose tomb has been desecrated</i>

201
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,640
<i>requires some tact,</i>

202
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:40,720
<i>I think now</i>
<i>is not the time to be a smartass.</i>

203
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,360
So, wait...

204
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,480
Fuck.

205
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,840
<i>Let's go.</i>

206
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:54,960
<i>With the sensor, Alban must make</i>
<i>the laser beams securing the tomb appear.</i>

207
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,760
<i>If the Sire of Varambon is in the room,</i>

208
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,760
<i>his mystical aura</i>
<i>should make the beams oscillate.</i>

209
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,680
I feel like I'm about to rob a bank.

210
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,600
<i>To attract the spirits of the dead,</i>

211
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,560
<i>there's nothing better</i>
<i>than an incantation in a dead language.</i>

212
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,240
Go on. Again.

213
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,280
Well, he doesn't wanna come.

214
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,320
What do you want me to say?

215
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,560
I'm in front of the beams.

216
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,480
I'm going.

217
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,200
I'm gonna machine gun Alban
with the firecrackers.

218
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,080
This is how we're gonna start off. Gang!

219
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,160
Well, nothing's happening.

220
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,640
I'm gonna go back.

221
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,320
The man never showed up.

222
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,680
Are you crazy?

223
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,160
I had to avenge myself.

224
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,960
You fucking piece of shit!

225
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:20,040
<i>In this scaring competition</i>
<i>between Alban and Ahmed,</i>

226
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:22,480
<i>you'd better not get upset easily.</i>

227
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,920
I would've had a heart attack
with the whole firecracker thing.

228
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,160
<i>However, one competitor</i>
<i>looks a bit feverish.</i>

229
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,520
THREE HOURS AND 51 MINUTES BEFORE DAWN

230
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:35,560
"Ornella, you have to go to room 113,

231
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,960
the room of one of the former caretakers.

232
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,680
"He disappeared one night
without a trace." Well, yeah!

233
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,280
"His ghost still haunts the place,

234
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,840
given the strange occurrences
detected in this room.

235
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,920
Ornella, it's up to you to purify
this room by freeing his spirit.

236
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,240
Take the Tibetan bowl on the table."

237
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,000
Read the end, please. The last thing.

238
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,560
Yeah.

239
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:04,720
"Try to make him appear in the mirror
and ask him to leave the place."

240
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,520
Fuck!

241
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,120
MISSION THREE
THE CARETAKER'S ROOM

242
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,200
<i>It's now Ornella's turn to confront</i>
<i>the hell of the monastery.</i>

243
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,760
<i>Even if that hell...</i>

244
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,440
You're so stupid. Fuck!

245
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,520
<i>...is the others.</i>

246
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:21,800
<i>And the ghosts!</i>

247
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:23,760
<i>And the spirits!</i>

248
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,520
<i>How we laugh!</i>

249
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,320
Yeah, it's here, son of a bitch.

250
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:49,280
My God.

251
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,800
This is awful!

252
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,160
Fuck, those are dead flies.

253
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,040
Look!

254
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,040
There are insects!

255
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,960
It's fucking disgusting!

256
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,280
It's totally organic.

257
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,880
No, stop! It's disgusting. It's awful.

258
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,040
Plus, it stinks.

259
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:19,080
It stinks like an old, musty man.
I swear. It's atrocious.

260
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:20,240
Don't worry.

261
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,800
<i>You have to go in</i>
<i>and close the door behind you.</i>

262
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,480
But I can't breathe anymore!

263
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,600
You have to close the door.
Close the door? Are you in room 113?

264
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:30,360
I'm trying to help you. Don't bug out.

265
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,880
You're really--

266
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,120
Do you see there are
roaches and shit in here?

267
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,480
Yeah, we see that. Fuck!

268
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,200
<i>And the ghosts!</i>

269
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,200
<i>And the spirits!</i>

270
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,000
<i>They're over here</i>

271
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,640
<i>How we laugh!</i>

272
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,560
<i>You have to close the door, Ornella.</i>
<i>Otherwise...</i>

273
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,880
You really need to shut your mouth, Alban!
That's the problem.

274
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:02,800
<i>- There you go.</i>
<i>- There you go.</i>

275
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:05,000
<i>There she goes.</i>
<i>In order to exorcise the room,</i>

276
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,560
<i>she has to make the caretaker's spirit</i>
<i>appear in the mirror</i>

277
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,480
<i>and ask him to leave the place.</i>

278
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,720
<i>Question: How do you make a spirit</i>
<i>appear in a mirror?</i>

279
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,920
<i>Answer: Thanks to the mystical sounds</i>
<i>of the Tibetan bowl.</i>

280
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,760
<i>Try to talk a little.</i>

281
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:39,400
Tell him, "Bro, what's up?
Why did you leave?"

282
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,960
Questions like that, you know?

283
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:43,080
You have to talk to him,
try to contact him.

284
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,960
Mr. Caretaker,

285
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,920
what happened in this room?

286
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,080
I swear, if something comes out
of the mirror, I'm gonna lose it.

287
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,040
I swear, my head is spinning.
It's like 12 million degrees in here.

288
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,640
I swear, I'm not feeling well.
Not at all. Okay.

289
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,440
- I need to take a piss.
- You need to take a piss?

290
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:18,480
I'm gonna surprise Ornella.
I'm gonna give her a little scare.

291
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:22,240
I swear, it smells like death in here.
Can I leave?

292
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:23,160
<i>Come back.</i>

293
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:34,760
What's wrong with you? That's awful!

294
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:37,160
<i>You're the monk</i>
<i>from the Chaussée aux Moines cheese?</i>

295
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:39,080
- Look at this.
- And it stinks.

296
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,040
<i>There are</i>
<i>two truly annoying things in life:</i>

297
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,160
<i>being locked in a monastery,</i>

298
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,120
<i>and being locked in a monastery</i>
<i>with Alban.</i>

299
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,760
<i>I'll let you guess which is worse.</i>

300
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,880
Alban, did you notice how much it stunk?

301
00:17:57,560 --> 00:17:58,440
Alban!

302
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:04,160
<i>It's time for an aperitif!</i>

303
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,920
<i>And the ghosts!</i>

304
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,320
<i>And the spirits!</i>

305
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:13,480
- You didn't see anything? No caretaker?
- No, I didn't see the caretaker.

306
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,840
I'm the only one
who's completed my mission.

307
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:19,200
I didn't want to say,
but I'm in contact with the spirits.

308
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,160
Lies!

309
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,160
Lies! Witch!

310
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,080
We're gonna burn your eardrums!

311
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,000
ONE HOUR AND 23 MINUTES BEFORE DAWN

312
00:18:29,080 --> 00:18:30,800
<i>Two questions remain unanswered...</i>

313
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,200
<i>At dawn, who will be named</i>
<i>the biggest chicken?</i>

314
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,640
<i>And how will they get out</i>
<i>of the monastery?</i>

315
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:38,160
<i>The last mission of the night</i>
<i>will bring the answer.</i>

316
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:41,760
"A copy of the monastery keys
is hidden down in the cellars.

317
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:45,920
If you manage to retrieve them, you'll be
able to get out of here finally."

318
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,080
- Who is up to go...
- Ahmed, go on.

319
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:51,640
You don't get it. I'm a coward.
I hate this stuff.

320
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,560
- Go.
- Why do you want me to go? I'm not going.

321
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,400
For real, as of now,
you're the biggest chicken.

322
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,320
So, go like a warrior

323
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:02,080
- to make up for that a little.
- What do you mean, "chicken"?

324
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,760
You're both real pieces of shit.

325
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,840
- What you're doing isn't right.
- Man up, bro.

326
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:12,960
"Man up," my ass!

327
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,520
What you're doing isn't right.

328
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:17,000
Don't worry.
The streets will remember you.

329
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,760
MISSION FOUR
THE KEYS

330
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,400
<i>Ahmed must find the key</i>
<i>that lets them out of the monastery.</i>

331
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,000
Where am I going?

332
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,080
<i>A key that is downstairs...</i>

333
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,200
<i>all the way down...</i>

334
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,040
<i>in the cellar!</i>

335
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,560
But I don't want to!

336
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:40,760
Fuck...

337
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:44,560
I'm gonna take a broom.

338
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:56,840
I don't feel well.

339
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,080
You're making noises,
you fucking assholes!

340
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,480
<i>Go on, bro. Focus.</i>

341
00:20:17,160 --> 00:20:20,640
Fuck! I don't give a fuck about the keys!

342
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:24,360
- I don't give a fuck!
<i>- Go straight ahead, Ahmed. Go get it.</i>

343
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:28,400
Bro, we're with you. We're following you.
We see you. Don't worry.

344
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,280
No... fuck.

345
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,960
If you go down, we can really see you.

346
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,240
Fuck!

347
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,000
Motherfuckers!

348
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,640
Well done, Ahmed.

349
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,200
Don't say "well done" to me!
I don't give a fuck!

350
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,040
Tell me where the fucking keys are!

351
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,320
<i>"Well done"? Do I look like your son?</i>

352
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,680
You're insane!
You'd think I just scored a goal!

353
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:57,240
Tell me where the keys are and that's all!

354
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,560
Listen, I don't feel well.

355
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,720
<i>Anyway, for what you're doing,</i>
<i>"well done."</i>

356
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:06,960
<i>Listen to me carefully.</i>
<i>Tell me where the keys are!</i>

357
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:09,000
So, they're down in the cellar,

358
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,400
<i>but you have to put down your broom.</i>

359
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:15,080
<i>Put it down. If there's anything,</i>
<i>hit it with the flashlight or the camera.</i>

360
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:17,040
<i>Put the broom down, Ahmed.</i>

361
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:20,240
<i>Well done, Ahmed.</i>

362
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,000
You need to go through another door.

363
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,400
Go through another door?

364
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,920
<i>- Yeah, there's a door.</i>
- Fuck!

365
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,760
<i>Go on. One last door!</i>

366
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:00,640
I'm not going in there!
Are you out of your minds?

367
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,880
It's horrible, really!

368
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,520
Fucking shit!

369
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,720
I can't go in there!
There's motherfucking wolf!

370
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:13,800
- I'm out of here!
- Bro, calm down.

371
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,200
- The key is in the wolf's bowl.
<i>- </i>So I have to go tell the wolf--

372
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,440
You're insane! I'm getting out of here.

373
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,320
- I'm coming.
- Well, yeah.

374
00:22:21,400 --> 00:22:22,560
<i>- Please!</i>
- Wait.

375
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,320
<i>Ahmed, wait. Don't move. Alban's coming.</i>

376
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,400
<i>I'm sure you didn't know</i>
<i>you could find wolves</i>

377
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,800
<i>in the Jura Mountains.</i>

378
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,920
<i>Well, Ahmed didn't know.</i>

379
00:22:33,080 --> 00:22:35,280
Ahmed! It's me!

380
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:37,880
There's a wolf! You're crazy!
My stomach and chest hurt.

381
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:41,200
- Shine your light so I can see the wolf.
- He's in the back.

382
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,200
Yeah, okay.

383
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,120
Yeah, okay, there's a wolf.

384
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,280
- It sucks there's a wolf.
- Your flashlight.

385
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,120
Give me your flashlight
'cause you have to get the key.

386
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,240
- Here.
- Thanks.

387
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,320
Okay, the key is over there.

388
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,800
It's over there in the bowl.

389
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,680
- Fuck, Alban.
- I'm gonna go in night-shot mode.

390
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:04,560
What a bastard!

391
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,840
I'm out of here!

392
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:10,840
<i>Ahmed, if you want to get out of here,</i>
<i>you need the key.</i>

393
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,600
Bro, it's right there.

394
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,760
I don't even see the door. Fuck.

395
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:23,280
That asshole left.

396
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,040
Look. You see how humans are, wolf?

397
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,160
It's really not pretty. I got the key.

398
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:32,720
<i>Alban has the key and the sun is rising.</i>
<i>It's time to leave.</i>

399
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,920
Come on. Let's go.

400
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,120
<i>But first, Ornella, Ahmed, and Alban</i>

401
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,680
<i>must choose who was the biggest chicken</i>
<i>and who gets the punishment.</i>

402
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,480
THE PUNISHMENT

403
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:49,320
He left us behind.

404
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:52,240
He saved himself as usual.

405
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:53,280
I think so.

406
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:58,760
<i>Seeing as how one of them ran off,</i>
<i>no need to think about it for too long.</i>

407
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,560
<i>Ahmed gets it.</i>

408
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,040
Alban!

409
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:04,320
Ahmed, thanks a lot.

410
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,920
- What a chicken.
- Seriously.

411
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,480
<i>As for the punishment,</i>
<i>he's just gonna have to keep running.</i>

412
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,440
<i>He doesn't have the key anyway.</i>
