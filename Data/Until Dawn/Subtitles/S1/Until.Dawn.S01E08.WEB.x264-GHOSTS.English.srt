A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,080
<i>Stop!</i>

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:18,200
<i>Fuck! Shut up!</i>

4
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,080
<i>Three comedians.</i>

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,840
It was my shadow. I was scared.

6
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,080
<i>A haunted place.</i>

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,080
<i>Paranormal missions.</i>

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,840
Is the treasure in one of these rooms?

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,960
<i>Traps.</i>

10
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:41,720
Stop!

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:42,760
<i>Challenges.</i>

12
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,440
- There's an armchair. Sit in it.
- No!

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,240
<i>For the most scared...</i>

14
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,520
<i>a punishment!</i>

15
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,640
<i>A game that's going to last...</i>

16
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,760
<i>until dawn.</i>

17
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,160
<i>Lord.</i>

18
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,760
I have no idea where we're going.

19
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,400
- Me neither.
- What's the worst that could happen?

20
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:10,640
SOMEWHERE IN BURGUNDY...

21
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,760
- The worst?
- Yeah.

22
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,280
That someone chases us.

23
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,000
Stop! Stop, already!

24
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,320
The minute you say something,
I get freaked out.

25
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,360
- Stop. Don't laugh.
- Anne-So, you're lying.

26
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,120
- Are you scared of anything specific?
- I don't like insects.

27
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,360
I'm pretending everything's fine.
I don't watch horror films.

28
00:01:30,440 --> 00:01:31,680
What am I doing here?

29
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:33,280
I don't know.

30
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:40,840
Guigui's waiting for us over there.
Careful.

31
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,920
- Yeah, but he must not be okay.
- What's that?

32
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:44,560
He'll pretend to be, but he's not.

33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,200
So, wait. Where are we?

34
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,920
Okay.

35
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,440
Okay. Well...

36
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:58,400
I hope my friends don't take too long
because I'm already shitting my pants.

37
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,880
Okay, friends.

38
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,080
I'm the first to arrive.

39
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,600
I'm gonna hide in the armoire over there.

40
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,360
And I'm gonna give them a little scare
to welcome them.

41
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,880
<i>Guillaume is going all out!</i>

42
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:17,040
<i>No surprise, because the goal</i>
<i>of tonight's game is to face your fears</i>

43
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,040
<i>and to play with the others' fears.</i>

44
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,440
- Who do you think will be the most scared?
- I think it'll be you!

45
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,720
I'm such a chicken. I admit it.
It's not...

46
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,600
But I would like-- Fuck.

47
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,800
<i>At dawn, a punishment</i>
<i>awaits the biggest chicken.</i>

48
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:38,400
I'm gonna give my all
to avoid the punishment.

49
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,720
We haven't gotten inside yet.
This is still the path to the castle.

50
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,680
- Okay, I was expecting a chapel.
- Yeah, definitely.

51
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,920
No... It's enormous!

52
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,440
<i>Yes, it's huge.</i>

53
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:52,280
<i>And it's called</i>
<i>the Manor of the Chastenay.</i>

54
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,880
<i>It's from the 14th century,</i>

55
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:57,000
<i>and it's built</i>
<i>over a network of scary caves.</i>

56
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:59,120
- No, I'm gonna freak out.
- No!

57
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,960
<i>But the scariest part is</i>

58
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,760
<i>there's a treasure here</i>
<i>that was hidden by a bloodthirsty duke.</i>

59
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:07,200
Excuse me.

60
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,760
I think there are enough horror films

61
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,560
that start with a blond girl, a black guy,
and a disabled man in a haunted house.

62
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:17,080
- And here we are!
- I swear, here we are.

63
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,880
It's really big. So, wait.

64
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:21,120
Come. There's light.
We're gonna go inside.

65
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,560
This must be the headquarters.

66
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,920
I'm already super happy
to have made it here.

67
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,240
- Guigui!
- Good. We can turn off our flashlights.

68
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:28,160
Gui?

69
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,280
- Guigui, you asshole.
- There you go.

70
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,560
- Guigui, you're not serious.
- Okay, great.

71
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:39,040
You're such an idiot.
You're really gonna pay. You'll see.

72
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,560
<i>They're already talking about revenge</i>
<i>and the missions haven't even started yet.</i>

73
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,520
<i>At HQ, there's all the equipment needed</i>

74
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:50,360
<i>in the search for this treasure</i>
<i>protected by the evil duke's spirit,</i>

75
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,400
<i>which will end... at dawn.</i>

76
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:54,080
MIDNIGHT - SIX HOURS BEFORE DAWN

77
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,880
So... "Elhadj,

78
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,200
it's time to go meet the duke."

79
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,600
- Why do I have to go first?
- Listen.

80
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,280
It's always like that, actually.

81
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,200
- The black guy's always first.
- You'll have to go to the cellar

82
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,880
with the pendulum. Where is it?

83
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,320
<i>The pendulum...</i>

84
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,840
<i>A little dangling ball</i>
<i>that will be used to communicate</i>

85
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:16,000
<i>with the spirit of the duke,</i>
<i>who's actually not that nice of a guy.</i>

86
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:19,800
"Each person suspected
of knowing where the treasure was

87
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,600
became a potential target.

88
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,440
In his craziness, the duke
physically mutilated his servants.

89
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,760
A presence still haunts the cellar.

90
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,560
<i>Try to establish a dialogue</i>
<i>with this presence</i>

91
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,800
<i>to find out if it's really the duke."</i>

92
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,840
No, I'm laughing,

93
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,960
- but it's not funny at all.
- I'm glad I'm not going. Sorry.

94
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,480
Deep down, I want to die.

95
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,880
MISSION ONE
THE DUKE'S CELLAR

96
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,800
No. Why me first and not the others?

97
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,400
Go on. We're with you.
I swear, I'm not well.

98
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:59,320
So, damn.

99
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,160
Well...

100
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,640
My God!

101
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:06,160
Fuck!

102
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:07,400
Fuck!

103
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,360
- What? What is it?
- You're not serious.

104
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,760
Stop. We're talking.

105
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,440
So, I was saying I prefer it in gray.

106
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,400
No, keep playing. You'll see.

107
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:20,520
- ...the color taupe...
- Keep screaming.

108
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,400
<i>Thanks to Guillaume and Anne-So,</i>
<i>who's touching up her makeup,</i>

109
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:29,600
<i>Elhadj isn't very calm.</i>

110
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,960
<i>And he hasn't seen the cellar yet.</i>

111
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,440
- No!
- What is it?

112
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,560
The stairs are very narrow,

113
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:39,640
and I'm gonna take them to the cellar?
Have you seen me?

114
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,640
I'm starting to panic.

115
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,680
I'm claustrophobic.
I hope downstairs is...

116
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:46,960
No, don't be scared.

117
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,520
You're not serious! I swear.

118
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,520
- Hello?
<i>- Yes.</i>

119
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,880
- We're proud of you.
- Yeah.

120
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,960
Honestly, it's cool.
Keeping going. You're getting there.

121
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,800
I stepped in-- What is that thing?

122
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,960
<i>- Frogs.</i>
- Fuck!

123
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:04,440
<i>Then again, I did warn you</i>

124
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,400
<i>that the manor was built</i>
<i>on top of a very humid cave.</i>

125
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,000
<i>But no one ever listens to me.</i>

126
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:13,960
Shit!

127
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,600
<i>Yeah, well, the scariest part</i>

128
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,120
<i>will be sitting in this armchair</i>
<i>and contacting the duke's spirit</i>

129
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:21,440
<i>to find out where his treasure is hidden.</i>

130
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,720
But it's dirty! There's dust all over it.
I'm gonna...

131
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,920
No, I don't wanna do this.

132
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,520
I'm gonna go crazy.

133
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,400
What's that noise?

134
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:53,880
My God!

135
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:57,640
Why?

136
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,480
Is there anyone...

137
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,040
in this place?

138
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,800
I'm hot, I'm cold, I'm hot, I'm cold.

139
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:12,520
<i>Is the treasure still hidden here?</i>

140
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:16,360
No, wait.

141
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,640
No, I'm gonna lose it.

142
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,640
Okay, I think it's moving.
You have to leave, bro.

143
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,000
What is this bullshit?

144
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,080
My heart! I have to hang in there. Sorry.

145
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,200
Fuck. I'm outside.

146
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,800
I'm outside!

147
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:48,760
I'm never touching a pendulum
again in my life. I don't want to know.

148
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,480
- Did you feel something?
- Like something was pulling on it.

149
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:53,240
You feel a slight force on it.

150
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:55,480
- I didn't want to insist...
- We saw it move.

151
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:56,400
We saw it move.

152
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,960
<i>And if it moved, that means</i>
<i>the duke did hide something in the area.</i>

153
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,880
<i>To try to find it,</i>

154
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,800
<i>the night's second paranormal mission.</i>
<i>It has to be done fast.</i>

155
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,080
FOUR HOURS BEFORE DAWN

156
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,080
<i>The treasure hunt ends at dawn.</i>

157
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,000
"The duke,

158
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:14,080
convinced his most loyal servant
knew where it was hidden,

159
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,080
locked her up in a dungeon in the attic

160
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,360
and cut off her tongue
so she could never speak.

161
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,880
Anne-Sophie, it's your turn
to contact the poor mute woman

162
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,320
in any way other than talking.

163
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,880
Go with a castle map and the planchette."

164
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,520
<i>The planchette is</i>
<i>a mystical means of communication.</i>

165
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,960
<i>If the servant's spirit manages</i>
<i>to move it on the map of the manor,</i>

166
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,080
<i>we'll know where the loot is.</i>

167
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:40,680
No, I'm gonna be all alone! This can't be.

168
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,440
Fuck! Stop!

169
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,960
MISSION TWO
THE DUNGEON

170
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,200
I'm not well, guys.

171
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,920
Fuck!

172
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,960
Listen, you have to go to the dungeon.

173
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,800
No! A dungeon? Are you crazy or what?

174
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,760
<i>- This can't be.</i>
- No!

175
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,920
<i>- No.</i>
- Yes, I swear.

176
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,720
In the attic, there's a little spot
and that's the dungeon.

177
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,080
Come on. Where is it? On my right?

178
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,800
On your right, Anne-So!

179
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,280
Motherfucker!

180
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,640
- What?
- No, it was my shadow.

181
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,000
<i>I was scared! Fuck!</i>

182
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,840
There's a stupid fucking mirror.

183
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,600
Fuck. I hear you laughing.
I hate you guys. I swear.

184
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:38,080
No, but why am I doing this?

185
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:41,400
<i>Well, to contact the servant</i>
<i>whose tongue was cut off</i>

186
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,640
<i>to find out where the treasure is.</i>

187
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,280
- Hold on a second. It's 48 degrees here.
<i>- </i>It's getting hot. I like it.

188
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:50,680
<i>- Stop!</i>
- No, that's not the mission.

189
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,040
<i>- Fuck.</i>
- I'm loving it.

190
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,600
<i>Put both hands on the planchette</i>

191
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,440
and start by introducing yourself
to the servant.

192
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,600
No kidding.

193
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,680
Hello.

194
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,600
I'm Anne-Sophie.

195
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,080
<i>Sorry to bother you.</i>

196
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,840
Is the treasure
hidden in one of these rooms?

197
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,280
The stairs...

198
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,000
The guards' room...

199
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,800
She doesn't want to talk or say anything.

200
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,520
Well, her tongue was cut off.
The poor woman.

201
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,000
Sometimes it's subtle. It can be...

202
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,680
a shiver...

203
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,880
a draft...

204
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,440
<i>It won't be something sudden.</i>

205
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,720
It's smooth, but every time
I go over the bakery, it slips.

206
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,400
I'm super hot, I swear.

207
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,680
I'm not well.

208
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,520
Motherfucker!

209
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,160
- What happened?
<i>- Fuck, I saw something!</i>

210
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,560
- Fuck!
- When you were on the bakery?

211
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:01,440
Okay, then. We had a lovely time.

212
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,920
All good things come to an end. Let's go.

213
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,560
TWO HOURS AND 27 MINUTES BEFORE DAWN

214
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,080
I'm not well!

215
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,200
I have a sharp pain in my side.
I'm gonna die.

216
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,760
You're getting on my nerves!
I'm sick of you guys.

217
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:15,440
- So?
- I'm too tired.

218
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:19,680
- The dungeon?
- No, 48 degrees in the dungeon.

219
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,080
- It's stifling.
- And the thing with the bakery?

220
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,280
It was around the bottom
of the planchette.

221
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,440
It wasn't something super...

222
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,560
- Distinct?
- No, not at all.

223
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,920
Actually, something
was happening there each time.

224
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,960
I'm exhausted.

225
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:35,960
<i>Let's recap.</i>

226
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:39,720
<i>With Elhadj, we learned</i>
<i>the treasure was in the area.</i>

227
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,640
I'm gonna lose it.

228
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:44,720
<i>With Anne-Sophie,</i>
<i>the location became more precise.</i>

229
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:47,000
Every time I go over the bakery, it slips.

230
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,640
Motherfucker!

231
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:54,600
<i>So now, it's Guillaume's turn to go look</i>
<i>for the treasure with a thermal camera.</i>

232
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,880
My God.
The thermal camera is horrible!

233
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,040
- You're gonna see sources of heat.
- Yeah.

234
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,280
It's red when it's hot,
blue when it's cold.

235
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,760
I got it. I've seen TV shows.

236
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,200
<i>Dawn is near.</i>

237
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,760
MISSION THREE
THE CURSED TREASURE

238
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,120
<i>But Guillaume still has to search</i>
<i>the bakery to find the cursed treasure.</i>

239
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,840
<i>When his buddies were struggling,</i>
<i>he laughed.</i>

240
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,640
I stepped in-- What is that thing?

241
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,680
<i>But now we'll see</i>
<i>if he's still gonna be a smartass</i>

242
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,520
<i>alone in the dark.</i>

243
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,440
Come on, ghosts. I don't give a fuck!

244
00:12:30,520 --> 00:12:33,360
Stop! You're gonna provoke them.

245
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,360
Don't laugh.

246
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,960
You're provoking them. Fuck.

247
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,120
You're very rude.

248
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,320
I'm acting tough, like I'm not scared,
but now I'm getting scared.

249
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,160
I'm scared. There.

250
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,240
- Where am I going? What do I do?
- You have to look in zones with heat,

251
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,320
and you'll find something there.

252
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,640
I can see myself as heat in the mirror.

253
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,760
<i>- Go by the oven.</i>
- Okay.

254
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,680
<i>Is there something inside?</i>

255
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,760
There's the camera's heat.

256
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,320
<i>- You have to see if there's something.</i>
- There.

257
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,080
<i>- Like what?</i>
- If there's treasure or not.

258
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,000
- Put your head in and check.
- Something shady.

259
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,160
There's some wood.

260
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,240
<i>- That's it?</i>
- Nothing. You're fucking with me.

261
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,760
<i>And there are no other sources of heat?</i>

262
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,040
Yeah, on my left, there's an area of heat.

263
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,880
<i>Hold on. I'll turn on my flashlight.</i>

264
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:33,640
Fuck, damn. He's scary.

265
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:34,960
<i>Look at his eyes.</i>

266
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,320
Stop. Can you imagine
if the treasure were inside?

267
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,040
If I said there were worms on it,

268
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,440
- would you believe me?
<i>- Stop!</i>

269
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:42,840
<i>- There are what?</i>
- There. Look.

270
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,120
- Stop!
<i>- On its feet.</i>

271
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,960
<i>- Shut up!</i>
- Inside the fox, actually.

272
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,280
- Are you kidding? There are worms?
- Stop! Fuck! Sorry.

273
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,200
<i>- </i>Yeah, there are worms in it.
<i>- Stop!</i>

274
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,120
<i>Fuck!</i>

275
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,080
In my opinion,
the treasure must be inside.

276
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,600
- You know what? I have a good idea.
<i>- What?</i>

277
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,080
I'm gonna bring it back.

278
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,960
- Are you fucking with me?
- Stop playing!

279
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,720
- Don't do that!
- Stop the foolishness.

280
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,160
- See you soon.
<i>- Stop your bullshit. Hello?</i>

281
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,920
- Bro, listen.
- Too late. I'm outside, bro.

282
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,240
<i>- What?</i>
- We're gonna dissect the creature.

283
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,680
No, but...

284
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,960
- The worms were on the ground.
- No! Stop!

285
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,240
Don't come closer! Fuck!

286
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,040
I'm not joking! Stop!

287
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:26,120
<i>- </i>Why are you putting it by our stuff?
<i>- </i>Look.

288
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:31,640
What I'm gonna do is disgusting.
I'm gonna stick my hand in your body.

289
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:33,200
No, he's insane.

290
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,480
<i>So... how should I put it?</i>

291
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,040
<i>We all want</i>
<i>to get our hands on the treasure.</i>

292
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:42,040
<i>But maybe this is going too far.</i>

293
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,560
- Fuck!
- He's insane!

294
00:14:44,640 --> 00:14:45,880
Look near the bottom.

295
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,960
Fuck, it's disgusting.

296
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:52,960
<i>That's enough.</i>
<i>It's so disgusting it's time to stop.</i>

297
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:57,280
<i>Fortunately, the sun is rising, putting</i>
<i>an end to this hardcore treasure hunt.</i>

298
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,480
Anne-So, come back.

299
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,320
<i>Well, we'll never know</i>
<i>what's hidden in the manor...</i>

300
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:04,600
<i>or the fox.</i>

301
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,120
<i>Even if our three friends</i>
<i>couldn't get their hands</i>

302
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,080
<i>on the loot hidden by the duke,</i>

303
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,120
<i>they should be able to determine</i>
<i>who was the biggest chicken.</i>

304
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,240
- Let's vote.
- For the biggest chicken?

305
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,160
I wasn't even scared.

306
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,320
One, two, three!

307
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,080
- There!
- There!

308
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,120
- Your punishment will be the cellar.
<i>- </i>No!

309
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,720
And we'll lock you down there.

310
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,720
No! Stop laughing!

311
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:35,520
THE PUNISHMENT

312
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,640
- No!
- Bye, Anne-Sophie.

313
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,440
- No!
- Go down to the cellar!

314
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,880
Stop. Leave the door open.

315
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,200
- Okay, can you go down?
- I'm going.

316
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,040
But don't you close the door.

317
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,320
No, seriously.

318
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,440
- Otherwise I'm gonna lose it.
- Of course.

319
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,360
Okay.

320
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,720
- Go down. Stop talking.
- Don't leave me alone.

321
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,800
- That wouldn't be cool.
- Go on. Go down.

322
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:59,160
Stop. No, there are frogs and everything.

323
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:03,840
- We're out of here.
- Bye-bye, we're leaving.

324
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,360
Fuck! Open the door!

325
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,000
Hugs and kisses, Anne-So!

326
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:09,600
Maybe one day we'll find
the body of Anne-Sophie Girard!
