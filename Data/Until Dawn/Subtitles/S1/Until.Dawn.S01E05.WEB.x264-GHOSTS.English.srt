00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,600
Work together to make it move...

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,480
and make the pedestal table vibrate.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,680
- It's vibrating like crazy.
- That's impressive.

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,680
We're gonna fucking prank them.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,640
This is a blue stone.

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,680
It's a ghost.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,240
<i>Three comedians.</i>

9
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,640
Hi, ghost lovers.

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,000
- Hi, Insta-story.
- We're about to go in the castle.

11
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,440
<i>A haunted place.</i>

12
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:34,520
- Poulpe! Bérengère!
- Thomas?

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:36,680
<i>Paranormal missions.</i>

14
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,480
I don't feel well.

15
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,480
<i>Traps.</i>

16
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:42,160
<i>Challenges.</i>

17
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:44,360
- Are you ready to try the mission?
- Totally.

18
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:45,680
<i>For the most scared...</i>

19
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,280
<i>a punishment.</i>

20
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:54,760
Hello. This is Thomas.

21
00:00:57,400 --> 00:00:58,760
<i>A game that's going to last...</i>

22
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,560
<i>until dawn.</i>

23
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,280
SOMEWHERE IN DORDOGNE...

24
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,360
Do you believe in ghosts or not?

25
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,920
I do, yeah.
I believe in energies, entities...

26
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,680
- ...in souls.
- He's already laughing.

27
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,160
- You don't?
- I was laughing at the word "entities."

28
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,280
If that exists, everything
we've seen in horror movies is real.

29
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:43,240
I believe when we die,

30
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,960
- we leave our physical sheath...
- Body, yeah.

31
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,960
...and we become energy,
like electricity or something.

32
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,160
So, it's scary because we can't see it.

33
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,520
If ghosts can go wherever they want,
why don't they go to Tahiti?

34
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,320
The soul is done--

35
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,440
Why don't ghosts go to Tahiti?

36
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,840
- I would definitely go.
- Yeah, take it easy.

37
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,840
<i>Well, I don't know about Tahiti,</i>
<i>but, in any case, there are ghosts here...</i>

38
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,640
<i>in the Château de Puymartin,</i>
<i>which will be their playground...</i>

39
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:14,880
<i>tonight.</i>

40
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,880
<i>Our three friends</i>
<i>are only a few kilometers</i>

41
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,960
<i>from this 13th-century building,</i>

42
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,320
<i>which was the epic scene</i>
<i>of a terrible domestic tragedy.</i>

43
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,200
"A dark legend,

44
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,280
a violent and jealous spouse...

a walled-in corpse,

48
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,440
and ghosts..."

49
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,360
Badass.

50
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:42,240
<i>No, not badass,</i>

51
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,440
<i>because the goal of tonight's game</i>
<i>is to face your fears...</i>

52
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:47,040
- Fuck.
- There are so many!

53
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:48,040
Haunted mosquitoes.

54
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,960
<i>...and finally get out of the car</i>

55
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,880
<i>to play with the others' fears.</i>

56
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,760
Go, Bérengère. We're right behind you.

57
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,400
Fuck.

58
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,320
<i>Bérengère seems on high alert,</i>
<i>but the other two are a little relaxed.</i>

59
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,760
<i>I don't think they understand</i>
<i>the house is haunted...</i>

60
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,640
<i>and that at dawn, a punishment</i>
<i>awaits the biggest chicken.</i>

61
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,440
It's mega happy in here.

62
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,880
<i>Happily scary!</i>

63
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:19,080
<i>Puymartin consists of tours, a dungeon,</i>
<i>a big living room, a small living room,</i>

64
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,400
<i>and squeaky doors.</i>

65
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:24,320
Go on in. Someone needs to oil this.

66
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,160
<i>Headquarters.</i>

67
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:29,520
<i>Walkie-talkies, monitoring screens</i>
<i>connected to surveillance cameras,</i>

68
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,760

69
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:32,840
A Berrier.

70
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,440
<i>Are you okay, Thomas?</i>

71
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,920
Yeah, I-- No.

72
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,080
Yeah, it's a Berrier.

73
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,200
<i>They have all the real ghost hunter gear.</i>

74
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:42,600
<i>Let the game begin!</i>

75
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,240
MIDNIGHT - SIX HOURS BEFORE DAWN

76
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,240
"Mission number one.

77
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:48,720
In the 16th century, after returning
from battle, Jean de Saint-Clar

78
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:52,080
caught his wife, Thérèse,
in the arms of her lover.

79
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,200
Thérèse was imprisoned,
and the lover was executed,

80
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,600
then hanged from a tree
where Thérèse could see.

81
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,760
Imprisoned for 15 years
in the north tower..."

82
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,960
I want to say,
"Thank you, Jean Saint-Clar."

83
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,600
"When she died, her corpse was walled in

84
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,640
so she could never find peace,
even in the afterlife."

85
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,440
"Goal of the mission:

86
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:19,240
try to contact Jean de Saint-Clar
to find out if he regrets his actions."

87
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,440
- That's the pissed off husband.
- Yeah.

88
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:25,080
Have to contact the guy
who walled in his woman for 15 years.

00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,880
<i>contact the spirit</i>
<i>of Thérèse's bad-tempered husband.</i>

92
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,960
<i>Bad-tempered enough</i>

93
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,160
<i>and lock up his wife for 15 years.</i>

94
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,440
<i>Yeah, pretty bad-tempered.</i>

95
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,520
<i>Even so, the guys</i>
<i>don't seem very bothered by it.</i>

96
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,280
Are the drinks okay?

97
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,360
Are we gonna do stuff or not?

98
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,680
Wait, guys, they're--
I feel like I'm at a party.

99
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,400
Okay, let's go. It's on.

100
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:53,360
<i>Thankfully Bérengère's there,</i>
<i>because I get the impression</i>

101
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,480
<i>Thomas doesn't really realize</i>
<i>where he's landed.</i>

102
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:05,520
These stairs are the perfect place
to hum Breton songs.

103
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,520
<i>Poulpe! Bérengère!</i>

104
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,560
- Thomas?
- What's going on?

105
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:16,720
Did you see an entity?

106
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,400
- Did you see something or not?
- Fuck!

107
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,760
This is exactly the type of couch
I'm looking for for my place.

108
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:27,080
- You scared me!
- I went to all the flea markets.

109
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,760
<i>They're there, sitting, comfortable...</i>

110
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,160
It's like meringue, except you sit on it.

111
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,200
<i>But we have a ghost to contact, guys!</i>

112
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,920
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Let's get going with the divining rods.</i>

113
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,240
Hello, Jean Saint-Clar.

114
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,520
My name is Thomas.

115
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:48,400
And I know you did something not so nice.

116
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,040
If I understand correctly,
you actually walled in your wife.

117
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,840
<i>Once again, I'm not here to burden you.</i>
<i>I've done some stupid stuff.</i>

118
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,640
Do you want a hot dog?

119
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,440
No.

120
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,880
I could understand that you feel guilty,
with respect to walling in...

121
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,280
people. That's not something people do,
even in this day in age.

122
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,880
Thomas, I wanted to let you know
I'm eating a hot dog.

123
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,120
I put some ketchup, mustard,
and fried onions on it,

124
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,520
<i>and it's hot.</i>

125
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,280
<i>Do either of you want</i>
<i>to come take my place?</i>

126
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,400
- Because I don't think this is working.
- Okay, I'm coming.

127
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,360
<i>Yeah, right. It's not working.</i>

128
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,720
<i>It's mostly that the call of the hot dog</i>
<i>is stronger than the spirits.</i>

129
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,360
So, you made me a hot dog?

130
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:38,600
- You told me no.
- I'm gonna go make one.

131
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,520
Is there an entity in the room?
I feel cold here.

132
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:52,120
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

133
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,800
That wasn't a fart, okay? It was this.

134
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:57,720
If yes, cross the rods.
If no, separate them.

135
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,320
Go on, cross the rods, yeah.

136
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,760
Okay, you're there. I feel it.

137
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,120
Okay, great.

138
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,320
I'm gonna ask you some questions now.
Am I actually talking to Jean Saint-Clar?

139
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,920
Cross for yes, separate for no.

140
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:29,440
Is that you, Jean Saint-Clar?
You're separating them. It's not you.

141
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,600
I'm not talking to Jean Saint-Clar.

142
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,720
Some really weird stuff is going on.

143
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,320
My arms are super cold.

144
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,640
<i>So, I'm talking to someone else.</i>

145
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,560
Yeah, I don't feel well. I'm super hot.

146
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,200
I'm really hot. Is this Thérèse?

147
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,440
Thérèse, if that's you,
can you cross the rods?

148
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,640
<i>Okay, Thérèse is here.</i>

149
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,280
Okay.

150
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,520
Thérèse, I'm exhausted.

151
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,960
I don't feel well at all.

152
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,240
I don't feel well at all.

153
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,280
- Are you okay?
- I don't feel well.

154
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,120
I started to feel dizzy.

155
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,640
- You felt it was too much?
- I started to have crazy hot flashes.

156
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:21,080
- A hot flash?
- A big hot flash.

157
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,200
- And my legs were like jelly.
- Like jelly?

158
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,080
I think I got really stressed.

159
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,920
<i>Okay, let's take a deep breath.</i>

160
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,400
<i>Let's pull ourselves together</i>
<i>and stay focused,</i>

161
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:34,680
<i>because it seems like Thérèse's spirit</i>
<i>is in the area.</i>

162
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,040
<i>I said to stay focused!</i>

163
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,840
THREE HOURS AND 45 MINUTES BEFORE DAWN

164
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:46,360
"As punishment for adultery, Thérèse
de Saint-Clar was locked up for 15 years

165
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,000
in the north tower by her husband.

166
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,840
This room was her final resting place
after she was walled in once she died.

167
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,520
Bérengère is going alone to the cell
where she was imprisoned

168

to recreate the conditions
Thérèse experienced."

169
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,720
Yeah, a real nice evening for you.

170
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,480
<i>The dungeon.</i>

171
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:06,600
MISSION TWO
THE DUNGEON

172
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,000
<i>Okay, guys, you have to stay focused,</i>

173
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,560
<i>because this is where Thérèse</i>
<i>was imprisoned for 15 years</i>

174
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,840
<i>and then walled in.</i>

175
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,520
<i>Poulpe accompanies Bérengère</i>
<i>to lock her up,</i>

176
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,440
<i>and Thomas...</i>

177
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,160
<i>Where is Thomas?</i>

178
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,440
Fuck!

179
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,360
- I found this awful thing.
- I was so scared.

180
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,440
This is from that time.

181
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,120
- Bye, Bérenge.
- Bye.

182
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:43,520
Poulpe, the image of you leaving
Bérengère alone in that room...

183
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,800
- Enjoy your vacation.
- Thanks.

184
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:51,640
I really can't lose the key,
because it'd be a problem if...

185
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,800
Shit.

186
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,120
<i>Let's go. With the help of her spirit box,</i>

187
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,760
<i>which captures ghosts' voices</i>
<i>between two FM frequencies,</i>

188
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,200
<i>Bérengère is going to try to communicate</i>
<i>with the spirit of poor Thérèse...</i>

189
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,800
<i>whose corpse is right in front of her...</i>

190
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,560
<i>in the dungeon wall.</i>

191
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:14,120
Thérèse, do you wish
to communicate with me?

192
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,760
Is there...

193
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,080
someone here with me?

194
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,880
<i>Wow. It looks like Thérèse</i>
<i>is trying to communicate.</i>

195
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:38,200
<i>So now's the time to take notes</i>
<i>and to not mess around.</i>

196
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,560
I'm really good at reading lips.

197
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,000
- Really?
- Now she's saying...

198
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,240
Damn, that's impressive.

199
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,280
<i>Are they serious right now?</i>

200
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,760
You can use the radio
to communicate with me.

201
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,760
Kebab.

202
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:03,200
- Kebab.
- Samurai sauce.

203
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,880
Thérèse, are you there?

204
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,480
- Did that move?
- We've been abandoned.

205
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,160
ONE HOUR 45 MINUTES BEFORE DAWN

206
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:33,280
<i>Yeah, we've been abandoned.</i>
<i>At the same time, you can't mess around.</i>

207
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,400
<i>If I were in Thérèse's shoes,</i>
<i>I would've left too,</i>

208
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:40,320
<i>because when it comes to playing pool</i>
<i>and hitting the mini bar,</i>

209
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,320
<i>you guys do it up.</i>

210
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,800
Are the drinks okay?

211
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,640
<i>But when it comes to contacting spirits,</i>
<i>after two minutes, no one's around.</i>

212
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,040
I don't feel well at all.

213
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,040
<i>As for who's the biggest chicken...</i>

214
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,600
Thomas, I just wanted to tell you
I'm eating a hot dog.

215
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:54,680
<i>...I don't even want talk about it.</i>

216
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:57,080
<i>So now, let's free Bérengère...</i>

217
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,360
- Well done.
<i>- ...and we're gonna get a lesson.</i>

218
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,200
Guys, I'll be back.
There's some shit in the attic.

219
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,600
<i>To contact Thérèse,</i>
<i>who, let me remind you,</i>

220
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,080
<i>was imprisoned for 15 years</i>
<i>before being walled in,</i>

221
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,280
<i>we're gonna use</i>
<i>the good old pedestal table in the attic.</i>

222
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:14,000
<i>And to do it seriously,</i>
<i>we're getting an expert on the matter,</i>

223
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,840
<i>Sandy Lakdar,</i>

224
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,360
<i>paranormal investigator.</i>

225
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,800
Here it is. I think there's...

226
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,000
I feel like we misbehaved.

227
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:26,560
Yeah, we're gonna be grounded.

228
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:30,320
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, great.

229
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,320
We're gonna try to do a real seance.

230
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,880
- Are you ready to try?
- Totally ready.

231
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:39,560
Okay. First, we're gonna
turn off the lights.

232
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:46,280
I ask all the energies in the universe
to intervene

233
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:49,400
for the nicest communication possible.

234
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,920
We do not want to work
with the lower astral realm.

235
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,480
Gabriel, I call on you to protect us
and create a protective bubble for us.

236
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,840
Thank you for creating
the nicest communication,

237
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:00,920
full of peace, love, and light.

238
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,400
Gabriel, I'm counting on you. Thank you.

239
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,840
May the energies of Château de Puymartin
come to us.

240
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,560
We're filled with love, peace, and light.

241
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,880
All the lords of Puymartin,

242
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,120
Thérèse de Saint-Clar,

243
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,760
we're here to listen to you, to hear you.

244
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,000
Please communicate with us.

245
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,320
I don't know if you feel it,
but there's a cold wind in here now.

246
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,440
I'm freezing.

247
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:39,240
- Yeah, I feel cold, too.
- Yeah, a cold wind.

248
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,040
I think I can feel what Thérèse feels.

249
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,200
Let it out. Don't hold back your feelings.

250
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,560
Thérèse is very sad, actually.

251
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,680
- Are you gonna be okay?
- Yes.

252
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,760
- She's using you as her medium.
- I know.

253
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,880
She can't talk.

254
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,160
Her throat is really blocked.

255
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,560
Together, we're gonna send
love, peace, and light to Thérèse.

256
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,960
She's using Bérengère.

257
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,840
It's gonna make her feel better.

258
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,520
How do you feel, Bérengère? Better?

259
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:41,840
I feel good, yes.

260
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:46,840
<i>There you go!</i>
<i>That's a successful paranormal mission.</i>

261
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,240
<i>Good job, everyone.</i>
<i>Now let's say goodbye to Thérèse.</i>

262
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,000
Listen, Thérèse, no matter what happens,
we came to cheer Puymartin up.

263
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,920
So, we did what we could...

264
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,880
We'll leave you a little mustard
and sausage downstairs

265
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,520
so you can make some hot dogs.

266
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,440
And I left
some ghost hot dogs on the stairs.

267
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,880
<i>There you have it.</i>

268
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:11,600
<i>And the sun is rising</i>
<i>over Château de Puymartin.</i>

269
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,320
<i>I got my yellow belt...</i>

270
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:14,640
- Yeah.
- ...in judo.

271
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,560
And I didn't see the point of--

272
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,160
- Idiot!
- I can't let you say that.

273
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,320
It wasn't judo. It was Taekwondo.

274
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:23,840
- I was so scared.
- That blood-curdling scream.

275
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,640
What an asshole!

276
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,280
<i>Anyway, it's time to decide</i>
<i>who was the biggest chicken</i>

277
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,360
<i>and make them endure a punishment.</i>

278
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,680
I don't know about you, but I...
I have to leave.

279
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,600
- I have some errands to run.
- <i>What do you mean, errands to run?</i>

280
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:43,000
<i>No one's going anywhere.</i>
<i>First the punishment, and then we leave.</i>

281
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:46,200
- Goodbye. Thank you.
- Goodbye, Thérèse. Good bye, everyone.

282
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,920
<i>Hey, there are rules!</i>

283
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,360
<i>Come back!</i>

284
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:52,800
Close the door. Don't let the ghosts in.

285
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,880
<i>Guys, come back!</i>

286
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,200
I learned something.

287
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,960
From now on, if someone cheats on me,
I won't wall in my woman.
