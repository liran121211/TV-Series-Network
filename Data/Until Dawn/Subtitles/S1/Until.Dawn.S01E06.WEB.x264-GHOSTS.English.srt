00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,040
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,720
<i>Let's pretend this is a nice</i>
<i>and super pleasant visit.</i>

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:14,040
There's a guy over there...

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:16,320
<i>Three comedians.</i>

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,320
It's your turn to see
if you can contact those spirits

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,160
to see if they're still suffering.

7
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,120
Even if they're still suffering,
everyone has their problems.

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,600
<i>A haunted place.</i>

9
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:30,880
<i>Paranormal missions.</i>

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,200
Are you there?

11
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,920
It's working! I don't like this!

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,920
<i>Traps.</i>

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,800
<i>Challenges.</i>

14
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:41,360
You have to do something horrible.
Turn everything off.

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,400
Fuck...

16
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,480
I'm not okay! Motherf--

17
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:46,320
<i>For the biggest chicken...</i>

18
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,520
I swear to God.

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,800
<i>...a punishment.</i>

20
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:51,360
I wanna go home to my mom.

21
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,200
<i>A game that's going to last...</i>

22
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,560
If you're hungry,
I'll make you a tarte tatin.

23
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,320
<i>...until dawn.</i>

24
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,440
SOMEWHERE IN THE PYRENEES...

25
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,240
- It's made of stone.
- Very Middle Ages.

26
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,400
- This is old stone.
- A medieval village.

27
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,080
- Yeah, it's very Middle Ages.
- There's a cat!

28
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:19,680
- That's a bad omen.
- You have to take me back to the hotel.

29
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,520
It's not reassuring.

30
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,640
- I'm filming the street.
- Jhon thinks he's Stanley Kubrick!

31
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,600
I'm a director. Leave me alone!

32
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,200
<i>Tonight, the goal of the game</i>
<i>is to face your fears...</i>

33
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,240
I don't like this. I avoid these things.

34
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:45,320
I've already been stressed out,
but this...

35
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,560
This is the most stressful.

36
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,920
<i>...and to play</i>
<i>with the fears of the others.</i>

37
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,040
Stop it! It's working!

38
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,840
The thing that could make me lose it

39
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,200
is feeling like I'm being touched.
That's terrible.

40
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,520
<i>At dawn, they'll decide</i>
<i>who was the biggest chicken</i>

41
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:01,600
<i>and give them a punishment.</i>

42
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,640
The most scared,
I really think, is Jhon.

43
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:09,480
- Fuck!
- "Underground of the fortified castle."

44
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,840
The two words don't go together.

45
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,920
"Underground" and "fortified castle."

46
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,400
Wait, first open the letter.

47
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,120
"At the end of the staircase,
you will enter Fort Liberia."

48
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,880
<i>Fort Liberia.</i>

49
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,360
<i>When it comes to creepy spots,</i>
<i>this place is perfect.</i>

50
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,920
<i>In this 17th-century prison,</i>

51
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,600
<i>a vast network of female poisoners</i>
<i>was locked up</i>

52
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,240
<i>under Louis XIV's orders.</i>

53
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,120
"Condemned to silence, the prisoners-- "

54
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,520
I don't like this.
"...would stay there until death.

55
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,040
This building was also
the scene of bloody attacks

56
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,160
which left traces."

57
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,720
<i>What craziness.</i>

58
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,840
<i>In any case,</i>
<i>between the spirits of the Sun King</i>

59
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,480
<i>and those of the female murderers</i>
<i>adept at black magic,</i>

60
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,800
<i>when it comes to ghosts,</i>
<i>this sounds like a promising group.</i>

61
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,960
"It seems that at nightfall
the souls reclaim

62
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,320
- the premises."
- Of course.

63
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,920
- I don't wanna listen.
- "The feeling of being watched,

64
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,560
sounds of crying..."

65
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,880
- No.
- There you go.

66
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,520
"Climb the stairs
and you'll find your headquarters

67
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,920
to start your investigation.

68
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,440
Who will be the most scared?"

69
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:12,880
MIDNIGHT - SIX HOURS BEFORE DAWN

70
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,760
Stop! Listen!

71
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,240
Look how long the hallway
and the staircase are.

72
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,400
It goes on forever.

73
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,440
I'm out of breath.

74
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,120
- I...
- What's that behind you?

75
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,640
- Stop!
- I swear. What the hell?

76
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,160
- What did you see?
- We don't see anything.

77
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:36,800
- Damn it.
- Shine your light.

78
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,720
All good.

79
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,520
Day 367. We're still on the stairs.

80
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,400
The year is 2023.

81
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,920
- What's this?
- Fuck!

82
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,400
An eagle!

83
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,840
Stop! I swear. I don't like birds.

84
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,160
Come here. Go behind me.

85
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,760
Look how big it is!

86
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,440
Why is it looking at me like that?

87
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:02,240
Don't touch me!
See? When I try to pass, it's screeches!

88
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,000
- Holy shit.
- Are you okay, bro?

89
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,040
<i>The Pyrenees eagle.</i>

90
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,840
<i>No surprise.</i>
<i>The fort is located at 600 meters high.</i>

91
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,880
<i>From up there, no one hears them screech.</i>

92
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:12,960
Stop!

93
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,360
- I swear to God, there's a body.
- Wait.

94
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,440
Look, there's a body.

95
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:18,160
- What?
- Look, there's a body.

96
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:19,760
What's that? Look in my camera.

97
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,400
- Fuck!
- What is that?

98
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:24,680
- Look, I'm filming. What is that?
- Okay.

99
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,440
- What's that?
- It's a mannequin.

100
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,880
<i>Yeah, I forgot.</i>

101
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,880
<i>This former prison turned museum</i>
<i>is filled with 100 mannequins</i>

102
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,920
<i>just to spice things up a little.</i>

103
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,680
- That's your bag!
- My purse.

104
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,080
Listen, this is gloomy.

105
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,600
HQ is cool. Check it out.

106
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:44,800
- There's a witch tree.
- HQ is the most reassuring.

107
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,760
<i>Headquarters.</i>

108
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,440
<i>Equipment, surveillance cameras,</i>
<i>monitoring screens...</i>

109
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:51,800
<i>Everything they need is here</i>

110
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,960
<i>to complete their paranormal missions</i>
<i>for this nighttime competition.</i>

111
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,840
<i>Jeanfi, it's on!</i>

112
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,000
"A few years ago,

113
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,400
some paranormal experts
assure they found the Sun King's ghost..."

114
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,520
I don't give a fuck.
I don't wanna see him.

115
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,000
"...near the chapel...

116
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,920
- Jhon Rachid..."
- No!

117
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:16,240
"...you're going to try
to make contact with his ghost

118
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,800
to understand why he didn't behead
the female poisoners."

119
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,680
- I don't wanna go.
- It'll be all right.

120
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,240
"Go look for the keys
in building number two,

121
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,000
box number two."

122
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,720
What the hell?
Why is it always the chapel?

123
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:34,880
MISSION ONE
THE SUN KING'S SPIRIT

124
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,080
Climb the stairs to the third level.

125
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,120
- Fuck!
- Holy shit.

126
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,200
Go up the stairs.

127
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,040
There are noises, I swear to God.

128
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,600
<i>Well, between us,</i>
<i>the chapel door isn't really locked.</i>

129
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,200
<i>Since Jhon's going for the keys, it gives</i>
<i>his buddies time to prank him.</i>

130
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:52,480
<i>- Right, Audrey?</i>
<i>- </i>I have an idea. I'll be back.

131
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,600
Jhon, sorry,
but this prank is too tempting.

132
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,280
My friend, you know
I'm doing this out of pure love

133
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,760
and pure fun.

134
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,560
I'm going inside that chapel.

135
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,000
And forgive me.

136
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,040
You should see the keys in box number two.

137
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,200
Okay, I got one.

138
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,280
There you go. You have to come back down.

139
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,400
We can stop there.
I'm already freaked out.

140
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,360
<i>- Jeanfi, stay with me.</i>
- I'm here.

141
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,400
Where's Audrey?

142
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,760
She's in the bathroom.

143
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,160
I'm going to God's house,
like we say back home.

144
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,760
So, I inserted the key...

145
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,320
<i>Yeah, that's generally what you do</i>
<i>to open a door.</i>

146
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,520
I'm turning it.

147
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,880
Holy fucking shit!

148
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,600
There are people inside.

149
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:35,520
They're praying. It's a chapel.
This is bullshit.

150
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,320
Okay. What's this? Okay.

151
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,400
<i>Salaam alaikum, </i>Louis XIV.

152
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,040
Holy fucking shit. Hold on!

153
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,080
Okay, I come in peace.

154
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,760
I'm a super cool dude.

155
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,200
If you're not cool with me,
I have a stick.

156
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,240
I will fuck you up.

157
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,560
I could stab someone
with these divining rods.

158
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:08,680
<i>Yeah, however, the rods, above all,</i>
<i>allow you to communicate with the spirits.</i>

159
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:12,000
<i>So let's sit down and chill out.</i>

160
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,840
So, Louis XIV, I come in peace.

161
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,720
I bring good vibes.
We can dance to funk or do what your want.

162
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,520
There's no bad energy, nothing.

163
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,720
I'm really chilled out.
I'm France's coolest guy.

164
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,960
So, I'm gonna establish
what "yes" and "no" are.

165
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:26,480
For "yes", separate the rods.

166
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,840
For "no", cross them.

167
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,200
Are you there?

168
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,920
Motherfucker, it's working!
I don't like this.

169
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,800
It's working. They separated.

170
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,840
I didn't touch them. They separated.
I told you I don't like this.

171
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,200
<i>Louis XIV, bro,</i>

172
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,600
why are you angry?

173
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,560
If it's because we're here,
separate the rods.

174
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:59,000
If it's because you got your shit going on
that's stressing you out a little

175
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,000
and you need a shrink or whatever,
cross the rods.

176
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,200
Those aren't questions, Jhon Rachid.
Ask him if he's angry at...

177
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,680
Jeanfi, please, let's think about this.

178
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,320
I'm in the middle of a chapel
with a group of people around me.

179
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,040
Fuck, the more I look at them,
the more they freak me out.

180
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:15,440
Come on.

181
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,000
So, Louis XIV, why didn't you execute
the women of the prison?

182
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,360
You can't--

183
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,680
You can't respond yes or no?
I heard some noise.

184
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:25,800
I'm gonna come closer.

185
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:27,720
Don't move.

186
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,360
You don't move either.

187
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,000
You there, you're weird.

188
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,720
You, there you go.

189
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,480
Stop it!

190
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,680
It's me.

191
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,200
I can't breathe. I swear to God.

192
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,760
Feel this.

193
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:55,920
Laugh, but feel this.

194
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:01,000
Audrey, you motherfucker.

195
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,720
That's awful.

196
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,640
Fuck, I should have known
from the beginning.

197
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,440
Fuck.

198
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,000
<i>Audrey's prank worked,</i>

199
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,920
<i>and Jhon Rachid needs to be careful</i>

200
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:13,560
<i>because at dawn, a punishment</i>
<i>awaits the biggest chicken.</i>

201
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,360
<i>But the competition between our three pals</i>
<i>is far from over.</i>

202
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,600
FOUR HOURS AND 30 MINUTES BEFORE DAWN

203
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,240
"In the 17th century,

204
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,600
one of the prisons
was reserved for women.

205
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,200
They were all sentenced to life

206
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,200
for participating
in different black masses

207
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,920
and several murders using lethal poisons.

208
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,800
Anne Guesdon and La Chapelain

209
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:40,400
stayed until age 36 and 43 respectively

210
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,720
<i>between these walls</i>
<i>for the attempted murder of Louis XIV.</i>

211
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,760
However, they claimed their innocence
until the end.

212
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,480
Ever since they died in their cell,
they continue to haunt the place.

213
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,200
Audrey, it's up to you
to make contact with them

214
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,800
and to figure out
if they're really guilty."

215
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,760
MISSION TWO
THE LADIES' PRISON

216
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:04,280
- It'll be okay!
- Yeah.

217
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,960
Lord, poor girl.

218
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:12,280
<i>Off to the prison alone to contact</i>
<i>the ghosts of the female poisoners</i>

219
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:14,560
<i>Anne de Guesdon and La Chapelain.</i>

220
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:16,800
<i>Fortunately, thanks to the walkie-talkies,</i>

221
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,920
<i>Audrey isn't really alone.</i>

222
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,080
<i>Talk to us, Audrey. You're not alone.</i>

223
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:22,400
- Audrey!
- Audrey!

224
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,760
<i>- Do you hear us?</i>
<i>- Audrey!</i>

225
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,920
Shit! I can barely hear them.

226
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,360
- Fuck, we can't hear her anymore.
<i>- Yeah...</i>

227
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,280
<i>Actually, she is alone.</i>

228
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:34,840
There we go.

229
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,440
I can't hear you anymore. I'm telling you.

230
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,840
<i>- But not exactly alone.</i>
- Motherfucker.

231
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:46,520
No! No!

232
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,760
<i>Yes, yes, yes.</i>

233
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,920
<i>And now, if there's a spirit nearby,</i>
<i>a weird noise could come out of nowhere</i>

234
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,760
<i>or sound the presence detector</i>
<i>Audrey's placing on the floor.</i>

235
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:57,200
You're in position.

236
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,000
I'm switching you on.

237
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,360
<i>But in order to lure the poisoner's souls,</i>

238
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,000
<i>Audrey has to relive</i>
<i>their past behind bars.</i>

239
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,560
<i>That means locking the door</i>
<i>and throwing the key away.</i>

240
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:14,880
My God.

241
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,240
She's in the dark, locked in a cell.

242
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:21,280
I'm...

243
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:23,120
Audrey.

244
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,880
I came to you...

245
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,640
in order to...

246
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:33,360
see if you're here in this place.

247
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:37,640
Could you show yourself
with the little thingy, please?

248
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:44,520
Fucking motherfucker.

249
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:46,800
It seems like one is turning its head
towards me.

250
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,480
No!

251
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,640
I'm scared.

252
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,880
First, let me ask Anne Guesdon...

253
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,000
and La Chapelain...

254
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,720
<i>to show yourselves.</i>

255
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:11,360
We really didn't bring a--

256
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,920
I swear to God!

257
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,640
The poor thing!

258
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,480
No, that's too scary.

259
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,280
Boys, can you come
and help me, please?

260
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:22,480
'Cause, let me remind you,
I threw away the key

261
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,840
- Do you wanna go?
- I'm going.

262
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:27,360
<i>Yeah, well, that's true. Locking</i>
<i>yourself in and throwing away the key...</i>

263
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,000
<i>maybe wasn't the best idea in the world.</i>

264
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,800
It smells like shit.

265
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,440
Fuck!

266
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:38,760
- Where did you throw the key?
- I threw it over there, by your feet.

267
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,320
Fuck!

268
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,680
Fuck!

269
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,480
Bats!

270
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:52,160
- Go away!
- Go away!

271
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:54,320
No, what a nightmare!

272
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,000
Shh, don't move. Slowly...

273
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,400
Damn!

274
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,040
My God!

275
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:11,000
My God!

276
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:14,760
<i>In this competition</i>
<i>for the biggest chicken,</i>

277
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:18,400
<i>Jhon Rachid can thank the bats</i>
<i>for scaring his buddies.</i>

278
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,920
TWO HOURS AND 15 MINUTES BEFORE DAWN

279
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:30,560
<i>But Jeanfi plans to turn things around</i>
<i>with a good scary story.</i>

280
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:31,880
One time...

281
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,520
I was in Les Landes at a friend's house,
and his mother passed away.

282
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:39,760
He buried her ashes
at the foot of a pine tree,

283
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,720
'cause she liked stone pines.

284
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,160
And one windy day,

285
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:44,640
listen closely,

286
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:48,400
the house we were at started burning down.

287
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,560
- No.
- Yes.

288
00:13:49,640 --> 00:13:51,280
'Cause of a short circuit,

289
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,920
everything burned,

290
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,240
except the mother's room,

291
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,360
- which is next to the stone pine.
- No!

292
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:01,600
And when I say everything, I mean
everything was black, turned to ashes,

293
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,200
except the mother's room was intact.

294
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,120
Fuck!

295
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,040
No.

296
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:09,040
Yes!

297
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,880
Motherfucker!

298
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,120
- It's an eagle!
- Stop!

299
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,280
Let's get out of here.

300
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,360
<i>The chicken attack</i>
<i>was not part of the plan,</i>

301
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,680
<i>but it made the story</i>
<i>so much more effective</i>

302
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,240
<i>that even Jeanfi freaked out.</i>

303
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,800
I need to drop the kids off at the pool.
I'm gonna go shit.

304
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,000
And then me.

305
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,440
<i>But if he wants to get out</i>
<i>of the punishment,</i>

306
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,480
<i>he's gonna have to keep his cool</i>
<i>during the last paranormal mission.</i>

307
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,400
"Fort Liberia is particularly isolated..."
We didn't notice.

308
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,600
"At the time, the soldiers who stayed

309
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:41,360
were treated on site
in precarious conditions,

310
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,760
and many of them died
in excruciating pain from infections.

311
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,200
- Jeanfi..." That's me.
- No!

312
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:51,960
"It's your turn to see
if you can make contact with these spirits

313
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:53,920
and find out if they're still suffering."

314
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,040
Even if they're still suffering,
everyone has their problems.

315
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,760
- Jeanfi, it's your turn to go.
- Wait, where is it?

316
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,000
You have to go up the stairs
and it'll be there.

317
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,640
Jeanfi, you need to take
the pendulum on the shelf.

318
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,040
- The what?
- The pendulum.

319
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,120
<i>Despite the name,</i>
<i>this pendulum doesn't tell time.</i>

320
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,280
<i>However, it might indicate</i>
<i>if a ghost has an opinion.</i>

321
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,440
<i>In short, for "yes," the spirits</i>
<i>will make the ball turn right,</i>

322
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,560
<i>and to say "no," left.</i>

323
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,000
- Wait, you need a flashlight too.
- Wait.

324
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,800
My mother didn't give birth to an octopus.

325
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:27,320
I only have two arms.

326
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,480
- Put the pendulum in your pocket.
- I gotta take it out if there's a monster.

327
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,720
- There are no monsters.
- Fuck, I'm not well.

328
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:37,560
- I'm staying here.
- I hate this.

329
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,600
I hope I won't cry when I see you leave.

330
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,120
MISSION THREE
THE MILITARY HOSPITAL

331
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,680
<i>Poor thing.</i>

332
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,200
Fuck!

333
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,440
I'm fucking dying right now!

334
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,400
I think I'm here.

335
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,680
I swear, I'm really gonna freak out, guys.

336
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,640
There's a staircase.

337
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,080
Another staircase. Fuck!

338
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,240
<i>You're near the nursery. Don't be scared.</i>
<i>It'll be on your right.</i>

339
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:10,800
<i>Go to your right. Right there...</i>

340
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,920
Fuck!

341
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,640
- Over there too! Look! Horrible.
- She has her back to him.

342
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:18,120
- I swear to God, this is horrible.
- So...

343
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,760
It seems soldiers
are getting treated here.

344
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:25,760
You have to use the pendulum
and tell them that to say "yes,"

345
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,400
they need to swing it clockwise,
and to say "no," counter-clockwise.

346
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,440
I'm not well. Son of a bitch.
I am not well.

347
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:37,120
<i>Yeah, well, you haven't seen anything yet.</i>

348
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,480
<i>Soon you won't see anything,</i>

349
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,360
<i>because if you want to pick up</i>
<i>the spirits' strange noises...</i>

350
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,320
- Fuck.
<i>- ...you have to do it in the dark.</i>

351
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:44,760
- Fuck!
<i>- Turn off your light.</i>

352
00:16:44,840 --> 00:16:45,800
No!

353
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,120
Sir.

354
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:56,000
No, I'm a friend.

355
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,960
Fuck!

356
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:02,160
Please, I'm just here
to understand your suffering

357
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,160
and to help you. I want to help you.

358
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:07,880
Poor thing.

359
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,120
Do you hear me?

360
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:13,960
I can help you.

361
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,640
Can I help you in any way?

362
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,840
"Yes."

363
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,720
The thing is turning.

364
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,520
He's not okay.

365
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:39,240
He's gonna puke.

366
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,560
I'm gonna lay down next to you,

367
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:46,760
right here,

368
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:51,360
in order to feel your pain
and see what treatment I can give you.

369
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,240
Everything's okay.

370
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,360
Hey? Everything's okay. Well, not for you.

371
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:10,920
<i>I'm gonna help you.</i>

372
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,080
I'm trying to feel what you feel.

373
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,080
I'm gonna prank Jeanfi.

374
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:53,440
Fuck!

375
00:18:54,560 --> 00:18:55,520
Fuck!

376
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,320
What a scare!

377
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:01,200
There were some fucking crazy noises...

378
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,320
We saw you on the monitor.
We couldn't stand it. Sorry, Jeanfi.

379
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,880
<i>The sun is rising over Fort Liberia.</i>

380
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,360
<i>It's time for Audrey,</i>

381
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,680
<i>Jhon,</i>

382
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,080
<i>and Jeanfi</i>

383
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:20,440
<i>to decide who was the biggest chicken</i>
<i>and make them suffer the punishment.</i>

384
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,520
Okay, so who's the biggest chicken?

385
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,560
It's a tie.

386
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,120
I think so.

387
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,320
Audrey was the strongest.

388
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,520
It's between you and us.

389
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,600
- "You and us."
- Yeah, I'm still in this.

390
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,400
- I had the chapel.
- <i>Yeah, we saw.</i>

391
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,160
Motherfucker, it's working!
I don't like this.

392
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,280
- And the hospital?
<i>- We saw that too.</i>

393
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:41,440
Fuck!

394
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,000
<i>We mostly heard that.</i>

395
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,200
<i>And on the scream scale...</i>

396
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,080
- Motherfucker! Stop!
<i>- ...there's no comparison.</i>

397
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,480
- You're the biggest chicken.
- I can't do this again. I've had enough.

398
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,600
- Jeanfi, please.
- I have an idea.

399
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,800
And it's to help you demystify the chapel.

400
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,640
Don't be a bitch, Jeanfi.

401
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,720
<i>No, that's okay...</i>

402
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:03,680
THE PUNISHMENT

403
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:06,480
<i>They're just gonna lock you</i>
<i>in the place you like the least,</i>

404
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:09,120
<i>where your buddy is, Louis XIV.</i>

405
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,200
- Stop!
- Close it!

406
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:14,720
- Bye!
- You're not my sister anymore. It's over.

407
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,800
I know. It's terrible.

408
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:18,160
- I love you.
- I swear to God.

409
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,160
- Come on. Let's go.
- Leave me a flashlight.

410
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,440
- Kisses, my friend.
- Bye!

411
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:22,840
Leave me a flashlight!

412
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:24,720
No, I swear to God!

413
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,840
Come back! That's enough. I did it.

414
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,200
It's dawn!

415
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:30,400
Do you have your stuff?
I'm not coming back.

416
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,160
Come on!

417
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:35,960
<i>Come on! That's enough!</i>
