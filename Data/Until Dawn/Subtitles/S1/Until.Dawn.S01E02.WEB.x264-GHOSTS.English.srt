A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,000
Good evening!

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,400
And welcome
to a new McFly and Carlito video.

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,080
- What are we gonna talk about tonight?
- Bats... and scary stories.

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,880
It's on. The first story
is that of Marie-Jacqueline.

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,400
<i>- Marie-Jacqueline.</i>
- Marie-Jacqueline.

7
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,120
- Marie-Jacqueline.
- Marie-Jacqueline!

8
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,360
Motherfucker!

9
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,080
<i>Three comedians.</i>

10
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,880
Can you twerk with your back?

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,400
<i>A haunted place.</i>

12
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,720
What is that, guys?

13
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,000
<i>Paranormal missions.</i>

14
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:43,320
Do you regret murdering a human being?

15
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:44,600
<i>Traps.</i>

16
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,040
I love you,
but I'll punch you if you sneak up on me.

17
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:49,440
<i>Challenges.</i>

18
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm alive in a fucking tomb!

19
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,680
<i>For the most scared...</i>

20
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,000
- There are noises, bro!
- What?

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,960
<i>...a punishment!</i>

22
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,600
Right now, I just want...

23
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,040
to go back home.

24
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,880
<i>A game that's going to last...</i>

25
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:11,920
<i>...until dawn.</i>

26
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,560
SOMEWHERE IN NORTHERN FRANCE...

27
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,760
We don't know where we are,
and that's a bit scary.

28
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,680
The situation is already scary.

29
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,040
See?

30
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,840
Why did I say yes?

31
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,320
Holy cow! Look, there's a gate there.

32
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,240
- There's an envelope!
- Did you hear that?

33
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,080
What's that? Fuck!

34
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,360
He grabbed my dick!

35
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,040
- I want to go home!
- He actually grabbed my dick!

36
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,320
- I've never seen anything like that.
- No, guys...

37
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,360
He got scared and squeezed my dick.
Who does that?

38
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,280
Can you hold this? I'll read this.

39
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:08,920
"Careful, beyond this gate,
you'll be inside ChÃ¢teau d'Esquelbecq,

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,480
the White Lady's domain." No.

41
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:13,120
<i>Yes. The White Lady.</i>

42
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,280
<i>And we're not talking about the cocktail,</i>

43
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,640
<i>but the legend,</i>

44
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,480
<i>with the scary castle, moats,</i>
<i>and drawbridge.</i>

45
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:26,120
"In the 17th century, a violent murder
took place, followed by a sordid hanging.

46
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,440
Ever since, a white lady
has haunted the castle

47
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,280
and strange occurrences are reported."

48
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:34,680
Okay, hold on. The White Lady, guys?
I'm gonna freak the fuck out.

49
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,680
If we're scared,
are we allowed to pull on dicks?

50
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,240
MIDNIGHT - SIX HOURS BEFORE DAWN

51
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,000
Let's go, delinquents.

52
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,920
- This gate squeaks.
- Listen to the sound.

53
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,080
Damn, that's creepy as shit.

54
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,920
<i>Exactly, my man. The goal of the game</i>
<i>is to face your fears.</i>

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,120
I'm definitely
the weakest link of the trio,

56
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,760
because when I'm scared, I freeze.

57
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,880
<i>And to avoid the punishment</i>
<i>for the biggest chicken,</i>

58
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,840
<i>you have to play with the others' fears.</i>

59
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,040
Fuck!

60
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,120
- No, really?
- It's already started, actually.

61
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,640
So, this isn't really scary. It's stupid.

62
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,520
I would say McFly
is gonna take defeat in the face.

63
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,400
Natoo or McFly, but surely not me.

64
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,600
Hold on. Listen.
Don't make a sound and listen.

65
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,040
Holy shit!

66
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:34,520
They're fucking geese!

67
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,000
You know what? Let's go. No questions.

68
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:43,320
No, we're asking a ton of questions!

69
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:47,920
<i>The answers to all their questions</i>
<i>must be found in this 13th-century castle.</i>

70
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,360
<i>A thousand square meters of creepy stuff</i>

71
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,560
<i>sitting on five hectares</i>
<i>of even creepier stuff.</i>

72
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,640
<i>So you won't miss</i>
<i>any of this dreadful night,</i>

73
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,440
<i>cameras placed</i>
<i>from the basement to the attic</i>

74
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,360
<i>are going to record all the weird stuff</i>
<i>that will happen. Okay, Carlito?</i>

75
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,320
<i>Carlito?</i>

76
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,000
Hey! What?

77
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,040
- Idiot. What did you say?
- Your name.

78
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:09,000
What?

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,720
He didn't have anything to say.

80
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,720
- Careful. I'm turning this thing on.
- I don't want you to.

81
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,280
Hello?

82
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:22,240
<i>Hello and welcome to the headquarters.</i>

83
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:25,960
<i>Here you'll find all the equipment</i>
<i>for tonight's paranormal missions.</i>

84
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,080
<i>Brass rods,</i>

85
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,560
<i>presence detectors,</i>

86
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,320
<i>a pendulum, even some chairs</i>
<i>for those who freak out.</i>

87
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,120
Okay, let's sit down, friends,
because right now I'm about to faint.

88
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,880
This is the first note.

89
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,760
It starts with my name. Fuck!

90
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:41,720
"McFly,

91
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,880
on January 21, 1655,

92
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:47,280
the owner of this place,
Marie-Jacqueline Trieste,

93
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,000
was taking her bath.

94
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,600
A disagreement erupted

95
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,160
and her servant smashed her head
against the bathtub.

96
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,840
In order to question the owner's ghost,

97
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:00,600
you'll relive the conditions
of her murder in that bathtub."

98
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,160
<i>First mission: a midnight bath for McFly,</i>

99
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,920
<i>with Natoo and Carlito</i>
<i>in front of the monitors.</i>

100
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,320
<i>Three, two, one...</i>

101
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,440
- Everything just turned on!
- Damn!

102
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:15,440
- "Castle of the White Lady."
- You have to go to the second floor.

103
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,800
- No, I can't do this.
- Yes.

104
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,080
- Do you see yourself going alone?
- No.

105
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,080
Not at all.

106
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,280
MISSION ONE
THE BLOODY BATHTUB

107
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:33,480
Once I'm at the top of the stairs,
where's the bathroom?

108
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,240
- It should be left and left.
- Left.

109
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:40,520
Fuck, what do I have to do?
Open the doors?

110
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,880
Motherfucker!

111
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,240
Fuck, guys, it's horrible!

112
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,320
- There's nothing.
- There's nothing.

113
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,080
No, there's not nothing at all.

114
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,640
This is horrible!

115
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,960
What is this, guys?

116
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,640
There's a bathtub that smells like death.

117
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,240
Is that blood?

118
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,360
Strip down to your underwear.

119
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,160
No.

120
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,680
Yeah, I got it.
I'm going to relive this shit.

121
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,720
<i>Bingo!</i>

122
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,960
No. Come on. No.

123
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:16,800
<i>Well, yes. According to ghost hunters,</i>
<i>putting yourself in the situation</i>

124
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,600
<i>can provoke the victim's spirit</i>
<i>from beyond.</i>

125
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,920
<i>So, McFly... swim trunks on.</i>

126
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:27,160
That body!

127
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,920
That's her, the White Lady.

128
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,280
Guys, I'm fucking shaking. It's horrible.

129
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,560
No. Fuck no.

130
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:41,600
<i>You're supposed to call</i>
<i>the ghost of Marie-Jacqueline.</i>

131
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,680
"Cover your eyes
to enhance your other senses

132
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:46,160
and sound propagates easier in liquid."

133
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,160
So, now submerge yourself up to your ears.

134
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,200
<i>In the water, blindfolded,</i>
<i>ears submerged,</i>

135
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,640
<i>McFly will hear all the noises</i>
<i>in the room perfectly,</i>

136
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,320
<i>including those</i>
<i>from Marie-Jacqueline's spirit...</i>

137
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,040
<i>if it appears.</i>

138
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,200
It's cold!

139
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,080
That cold?

140
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,680
Fuck! That's horrible.

141
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,360
My lower abdomen.

142
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,720
What the fuck am I doing?

143
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,120
- Fuck! That breaks my heart.
- It's awful.

144
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,280
It's awful.

145
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,400
Everything's okay. That face.

146
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:38,240
- I love you so much, sweetheart.
- We love you so much.

147
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:40,640
<i>- What should I do?</i>
- You're gonna ask her questions.

148
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,280
For example: did the servant
have reasons to dislike you?

149
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,680
Was she jealous?

150
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,360
- I can't. Fuck!
- It's awful. I never would've done that.

151
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,360
Did your servant
have reasons to dislike you?

152
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,200
Guys, I feel stuff. I swear.

153
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,520
Okay...

154
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:15,760
It's not physical stuff.
It's just stuff I'm feeling.

155
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,680
<i>Okay.</i>

156
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,120
Things I'm feeling.
It's horrible being in the water.

157
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:22,000
Fuck, that's horrible.

158
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Is she really the one
who murdered you?

159
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:36,440
Fucking motherfucker!
Guys, I'm getting out of this bathtub.

160
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,760
There was something, noises.
It's horrible.

161
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,560
I don't know how to explain it.
Like something in the bathtub was moving.

162
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,120
You handled that so well.

163
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,320
That's hell on Earth.

164
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,560
Motherfucker...

165
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,240
It was horrible for me to wait so long.

166
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,160
Holy shit!

167
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,800
Something happened in the tub?

168
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,880
FOUR HOURS AND 45 MINUTES BEFORE DAWN

169
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,800
There was stuff in the water.

170
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:17,440
I'm gonna try to start from the beginning.
There was a noise in the bathtub.

171
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,560
Horrible!

172
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:21,240
I'm so happy that's over.

173
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:24,400
<i>Between Marie-Jacqueline's spirit</i>
<i>and Lady Carlito,</i>

<i>McFly is on track</i>
<i>for the biggest chicken's punishment.</i>

175
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,160
<i>But the night is far from over.</i>

176
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,760
"The villagers say
the White Lady would haunt the gardens...

177
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,480
in search of a tomb,
which she was never given.

178
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,000
Carlito, to free her soul,
you will be buried

179
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,840
with the pendant at HQ,

180
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,760
similar to the one she had.

181
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,160
With the pendant in hand,
call Marie-Jacqueline's ghost."

182
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,920
Me, outside, buried, calling the ghost?

183
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,280
"The movement detector
that McFly will put on the tomb

184
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,600
will confirm her passage underground.

185
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,480
Carlito, take the pendant
and the oxygen tank."

186
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,160
- That's the scariest sentence.
- Go on. Test it.

187
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,120
Put your mouth on it. And you breathe.

188
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,160
<i>Now, in terms of creepy...</i>

189
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,360
MISSION TWO
THE TOMB

190
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,680
<i>...it can't get worse.</i>

191
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,400
<i>In this forest, Marie-Jacqueline</i>
<i>was buried by her murderer</i>

192
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,000
<i>before her body was uncovered by a dog.</i>

193
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,960
<i>Yeah, a mutt.</i>

194
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:29,240
<i>So, a pretty dark story.</i>

195
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:31,640
I see a cross.

196
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,320
- What? A cross?
- No!

197
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,000
- Holy shit.
- That's atrocious.

198
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,600
<i>So now, the idea is</i>
<i>to ask Marie-Jacquie's spirit</i>

199
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,760
<i>to come rest in a four-star grave.</i>

200
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,560
<i>Okay, two stars.</i>

201
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,840
- What's that insect?
- A spider. Wait. I'll get it out.

202
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,760
Yeah, I'll get it.

203
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:56,800
I'm anxious just seeing you in there.

204
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,600
- I just realized what I'm about to do.
- Don't think about it.

205
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,960
- That's your mistake.
- My God. Guys!

206
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,720
- Bro.
- It's atrocious.

207
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,880
This is the worst thing in the world.

208
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,320
Sorry, I dropped some dirt...

209
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,240
Fuck!

210
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,920
<i>- Come on. Close the lid.</i>
- Bro, you're a king.

211
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,720
Fuck! Plus, it's tight in here.

212
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,360
- Yeah?
- It's horrible.

213
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,200
Holy shit, doing this
is unbelievable. Fuck.

214
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,120
I'm gonna set up
the movement detector, okay?

215
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,880
Man, if anything goes wrong,
you handle it, all right?

216
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,960
Yeah, don't worry.

217
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,960
<i>The movement detector.</i>

218
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,400
<i>It's very simple.</i>
<i>It's like a house alarm, but for ghosts.</i>

219
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,280
<i>If someone comes near,</i>
<i>it's gonna make noises and flash.</i>

220
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,760
The movement detector is in place, bro.

221
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:46,640
- I'm leaving. Later. I love you.
- I'm alive in a fucking tomb!

222
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,760
<i>Marie-Jacqueline. If you're there,</i>
<i>Marie-Jacqueline, show yourself.</i>

223
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,160
<i>We need to understand...</i>

224
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:10,760
<i>that you're there.</i>

225
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,600
<i>I heard a noise.</i>

226
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,920
- What did you hear?
- What noise?

227
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,600
<i>A fucking noise!</i>

228
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:23,320
There's nothing on the monitor.

229
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,840
Fuck, it's horrible.

230
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,760
<i>Marie-Jacqueline, please,</i>

231
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,800
<i>if you're there,</i>

232
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:30,800
<i>make some noise.</i>

233
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,280
<i>Marie-Jacqueline, are you there?</i>

234
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,560
There's noise, bro!

235
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,560
What's going on, bro? Come back!

236
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,440
Fuck! This is horrible!

237
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,920
I'm out of here. I don't give a shit!

238
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,640
I'm leaving the oxygen tank.

239
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,440
Come on. Let's go get him.

240
00:12:58,280 --> 00:13:01,040
Fuck, this is horrible!
I don't know where I am!

241
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,560
I don't know where I am!

242
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,640
- Bro!
- I see you.

243
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,000
- Bro.
- Are you okay?

244
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:10,120
Fuck, I heard noises.

245
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,200
I thought you felt something
in the tomb.

246
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,120
No!

247
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:15,360
There's noise over there.

248
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,400
Bro, come quick!

249
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:28,320
Okay.

250
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,000
What craziness.

251
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,160
Holy shit, seeing you
locked in that tomb...

252
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:35,200
It's crazy stressful.

253
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,320
Would you have done it?

254
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,040
- It's crazy.
- Fuck.

255
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:45,000
<i>At this point, Carlito and McFly</i>
<i>have already freaked out.</i>

256
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,880
I'm out of here! I don't give a shit!

257
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:50,440
<i>But Carlito also made McFly freak out.</i>

258
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:56,080
<i>So at the moment,</i>
<i>the biggest chicken is McFly.</i>

259
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,120
<i>Unless he's got something up his sleeve,</i>
<i>like... I don't know... Hide and Clap.</i>

260
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,600
I suggest we play Hide and Clap.

261
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,480
When you say clap, I'll go...

262
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,400
- No.
- It gives you a clue about where I am.

263
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,560
Are you guys game?

264
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,480
Yeah.

265
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,200
Let's go. I'm gonna hide.

266
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,800
Later. I'm gonna go see
the White Lady alone.

267
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,680
I think he must've gone upstairs.

268
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,240
Three, two, one...

269
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:29,200
- Clap!
- Clap!

270
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:33,320
It's close.

271
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,000
Yeah, but I don't dare go in.

272
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:38,680
Motherfucker!

273
00:14:41,840 --> 00:14:42,920
Ready for another?

274
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:45,120
Three, two, one...

275
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:46,200
- Clap!
- Clap!

276
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,960
- Fuck, it's getting further.
- He's further. He's moving.

277
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,200
- You're not allowed to move!
- Mobile Hide and Seek is cheating.

278
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,640
I love you,
but I'll punch you if you sneak up on me.

279
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,880
You have the same reflex.

280
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:06,520
Fuck!

281
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,240
- If there were... What?
- Go on!

282
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:13,920
- Let's go. Back to back.
<i>- </i>Go on.

283
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,720
Go on. Push me!

284
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,640
<i>- </i>Go on.
<i>- </i>I hate going backwards.

285
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:25,240
<i>- </i>There are a lot of bats. Really a lot.
<i>- </i>Okay, three, two, one, clap!

286
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,600
He's really close. That's why.

287
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,640
I'm sure.

288
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:33,320
- Or in a big box.
- I don't know.

289
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:39,440
- He's gonna scare you for no reason.
- Careful or you're gonna get punched, bro!

290
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,000
- He's in an armchair.
- He's here. Three, two, one, clap!

291
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:54,000
I made you freak out!

292
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:55,920
Fuck, let's hide.

293
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,960
No! I don't have a flashlight.
It's not fair.

294
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,560
I don't have a flashlight, guys.

295
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:09,920
Fuck!

296
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,840
Now watch what it's like
not to bat an eye.

297
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:14,760
You're gonna see a man
who's not afraid.

298
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,520
Are you ready?

299
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:19,600
Hello!

300
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:27,360
- "Gonna see a man who's not afraid."
- You're not scared.

301
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,680
You're crazy.

302
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,680
I'm the least scared guy of all time.

303
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:36,680
I screamed at the top of my lungs,
and you jumped a little.

304
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:39,000
But he said, "Hello,"
and I fell to the ground.

305
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,360
<i>Nice try, but McFly</i>
<i>got caught in his own game.</i>

306
00:16:44,080 --> 00:16:45,880
<i>Now, if he doesn't want the punishment,</i>

307
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,200
<i>he has to find something</i>
<i>during Natoo's mission...</i>

308
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,920
TWO HOURS AND 53 MINUTES BEFORE DAWN

309
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,480
<i>...with the murderer's spirit.</i>

310
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,200
"In order to conceal her crime,

311
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,840
the servant waited until night
to drag her master's body

312
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,040
out of the bathroom and hide it.

313
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,040
Quickly suspected,
the servant was chained up in the cellar

314
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:08,360
as she awaited her final punishment:

315
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,880
death by hanging."

316
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,120
Fuck.

317
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,880
"Since then, her ghost
has often appeared in the cellar.

318
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,720
Natoo...

319
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:21,800
go downstairs
and look for the servant's ghost

320
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:24,160
to ask her why she did what she did.

321
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,680
- Take the divining rods."
- That's not cool at all.

322
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,160
I don't know how to use them.

323
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,720
<i>Okay, quick tutorial.</i>

324
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,040
<i>Step one: Hold the rods in your hands.</i>

325
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,360
<i>Step two: Ask the ghost questions.</i>

326
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,360
<i>Step three: If the answer is yes,</i>
<i>the rods spread apart.</i>

327
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,360
<i>If the answer is no, they cross.</i>

328
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,840
<i>Simple. Basic.</i>

329
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,120
Is my name really Nathalie, aka Natoo?

330
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,600
- There you go.
- The dowser is speaking!

331
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,680
- Good.
- Okay.

332
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:57,240
MISSION THREE
THE SERVANT'S CELLAR

333
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,440
Do you see me?

334
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:03,840
Go on.

335
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:05,080
<i>Yeah, we see you.</i>

336
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:07,680
<i>There, we see you again.</i>
<i>It's really funny.</i>

337
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:10,080
- Those leggings are crazy.
<i>- Guys.</i>

338
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,000
You can see me, then?

339
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,120
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- We see you.</i>

340
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:16,320
<i>- Look, there's a little camera.</i>
<i>- </i>To be sure, what am I doing?

341
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,440
<i>- She's twerking.</i>
<i>- She's twerking her back.</i>

342
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,520
<i>She's really twerking.</i>

343
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,560
Can you twerk with your back?

344
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,280
Twerk with my back? Okay.

345
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,720
That's majestic.

346
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,960
You need to keep going.

347
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:33,720
If there's someone in the back,
I won't hesitate to knock you out.

348
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,720
I'm so scared, I'm gonna puke.

349
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,840
Honestly, I have nothing
to do with this mess.

350
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:54,880
I have nothing to do with this.

351
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,040
- Guys!
- What?

352
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,440
I hear footsteps. I hate this part.

353
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,000
"First thing: recreate the moment's energy

354
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,920
by sitting on the edge of the bed
like the servant."

355
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,120
<i>Fuck...</i>

356
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,000
The thing is...

357
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:20,400
if something happens to me,
I'm deep in a cellar. Really.

358
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,120
"Here is the next mission.

359
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:24,520
<i>Turn off all the lights."</i>

360
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,400
I can't!

361
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:32,760
<i>- I know. It's the hardest thing.</i>
- Being in the dark scares me the most.

362
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,520
<i>- You're doing fine.</i>
<i>- We love you.</i>

363
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:39,000
I swear... Once, I spent an entire night,

364
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:42,800
six hours straight, frozen in the dark
because I heard some noises.

365
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,360
I admit it's crazy,

366
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,840
but listen, we see everything
and nothing's there.

367
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:47,840
Nothing.

368
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,480
You're alone.
You can relax, completely alone.

369
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:56,920
The first question to ask,
"Was your master mean to you?"

370
00:19:57,000 --> 00:20:00,000
I'm letting you contact her.
We're here. We're not leaving.

371
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,880
Was your master mean to you?

372
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:09,640
Asshole...

373
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:22,480
They're spreading a little.
That means yes.

374
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,200
I think they're spreading. I'm not well.

375
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,120
- I'm gonna curl up in fear.
- Do you trust me or not?

376
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,360
Do you trust me or not?

377
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:35,400
Put this on.

378
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,520
Are you nice?

379
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,600
Will you be nice to me?
You won't hurt me?

380
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,640
Was your act premeditated?

381
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,080
Yes?

382
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:51,120
Yeah? Okay.

383
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,800
We all make mistakes.

384
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,000
Maybe you regret your actions?

385
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,440
Do you regret murdering a human being?

386
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,360
I really didn't move the rods...

387
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,320
and they said, "No."

388
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,280
I'm not okay...

389
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,160
<i>Can I leave?</i>

390
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,080
I'll put it on backwards.

391
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,840
I'm such an idiot.

392
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,400
- We can see your face.
- Yeah.

393
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:35,560
I hear whispering!

394
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,400
What's that?

395
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:47,040
Servant?

396
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:49,360
Servant?

397
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,960
Boys?

398
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,360
I failed.

399
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:24,000
Wait.

400
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:26,640
I saw his big white sneakers sticking out.

401
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,960
<i>Yeah... It's about time</i>
<i>the sun started rising.</i>

402
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,720
<i>So who will be chosen for the punishment?</i>

403
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,640
<i>In my opinion, it's McFly.</i>

404
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,840
<i>No, Carlito.</i>

405
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:46,640
<i>Or maybe Natoo.</i>

406
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:49,840
"Friends, it's time to choose
who the biggest chicken was."

407
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,400
It's vexing. I have to say.

408
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,680
Let's agree on the punishment.

409
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:59,080
This scariest thing...
for the biggest chicken

410
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:00,920
is the tomb.

411
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:01,960
Yeah, the tomb.

412
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,240
Seriously, guys?

413
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,800
Why would I go in the tomb?

414
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:09,160
Why would I go in the tomb?
For what reason?

415
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,400
'Cause you were the least brave, clearly.
Sorry.

416
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:14,360
You guys are assholes.
That's a horrible thing to do.

417
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:17,640
THE PUNISHMENT

418
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:20,240
I'm gonna show you
I'm not the biggest chicken.

419
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,400
- Can you close it?
- Come on. Let's go.

420
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:26,320
I hope...

421
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,840
I don't fart in my tomb. Can you imagine?

422
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,400
Hey, guys? What's that noise?

423
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,480
McFly, you have more subscribers
than me on Instagram, right?

424
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,720
- Yeah, but...
- Do you think that pisses me off?

425
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,520
- It's because I post regularly.
- Don't worry.

426
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,680
Stop, please! I didn't do that to you!

427
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:50,040
I just farted.
