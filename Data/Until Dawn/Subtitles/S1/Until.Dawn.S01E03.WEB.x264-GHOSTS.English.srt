A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:12,680
<i>Jean, I'm nice</i>

3
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,160
<i>Jean, are you there?</i>

4
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:25,080
<i>Jean, did you get rid of the demon?</i>

5
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:32,120
Hold on a second!

6
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,920
Fuck! Son of a--

7
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:38,720
<i>Three comedians.</i>

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,640
<i>This reminds me of when I worked</i>
<i>at an S&M club.</i>

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,640
<i>A haunted place.</i>

10
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,800
The detector detected some stuff. Fuck!

11
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:50,680
Son of a--

12
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:52,120
<i>Paranormal missions.</i>

13
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:53,800
- What's that?
- There was something.

14
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:54,840
<i>Traps.</i>

15
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,200
I'm gonna make them crack.

16
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,200
Fuck!

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:59,120
<i>Challenges.</i>

18
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,480
- Can you?
- No, I can't.

19
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,320
- I can.
- What?

20
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:03,640
<i>For the most scared...</i>

21
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,280
<i>a punishment!</i>

22
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:08,200
No, I can't!

23
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,920
<i>The game will last...</i>

24
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,680
<i>until dawn.</i>

25
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:29,840
SOMEWHERE IN CHARENTE-MARITIME...

26
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,320
- Friends!
- This is crazy.

27
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,960
This is crazy.

28
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,400
This is crazy.

29
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,840
I'm unfazed.

30
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,960
I'm actually scared.

31
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,160
I'm really, really, really too scared.

32
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,000
Everything's gonna be fine.

33
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,480
The ghosts are friendly.
The ghosts are nice.

34
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,520
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

35
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:01,760
- This is heavy, like...
- What?

36
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,160
- That's what it is? There's a paper.
- Can I open it?

37
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,400
"Welcome to this abandoned
18th-century hospital."

38
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,480
<i>A hospital!</i>

39
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,160
<i>For starters, it's already worrisome,</i>
<i>but it's been abandoned since the '80s?</i>

40
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,480
<i>A nightmare!</i>

41
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:21,280
<i>Eighty thousand square meters</i>
<i>eroded by sickness and ghosts.</i>

42
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,400
<i>Okay, that's it. I don't feel well.</i>

43
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,800
"Numerous patients died as a result
of cholera, the plague, and rabies.

44
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,520
They say this place is haunted.
You'll spend the night here

45
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,400
to investigate the presence of ghosts."

46
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,400
Fuck!

47
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,640
Am I the one who's gonna be haunted?

48
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,200
Damn!

49
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,520
I'm not scared.

50
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,640
It's just a hospital. There.

51
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,840
<i>Not scared?</i>

52
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,600
<i>We'll see, my friend...</i>

53
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,520
<i>since the goal of tonight's game</i>
<i>is actually to face your fears...</i>

54
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,640
- Why did I say yes?
- I don't know why we said yes.

55
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,800
<i>...and to play with the others' fears.</i>

56
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,480
- Fuck, you're an idiot!
- Asshole.

57
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:12,080
You're such an idiot! Fuck, no!

58
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,880
<i>Idiot, I don't know,</i>

59
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,720
<i>but, in any case,</i>
<i>Noom has understood the idea.</i>

60
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,600
<i>At dawn, they will decide</i>
<i>who was the most scared,</i>

61
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,920
<i>and that person will endure a punishment.</i>

62
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,960
<i>Let the game begin!</i>

63
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,560
- Go in.
- Go on, Djimo.

64
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,240
MIDNIGHT - SIX HOURS BEFORE DAWN

65
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,920
- Fuck!
- What? Walkers? Why the fuck?

66
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,320
- What was that?
- It's the wind!

67
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,080
- What?
- It's the wind!

68
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,720
- Calm down, guys.
- The wind.

69
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:45,920
Left or right?

70
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:52,400
<i>Four levels of never-ending hallways</i>
<i>and run-down rooms.</i>

71
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,360
<i>On the second floor, a headquarters.</i>

72
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:01,040
<i>Equipment, control monitors,</i>
<i>surveillance cameras...</i>

73
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,280
<i>Considering how wrecked the building is,</i>
<i>we're lucky to still have electricity.</i>

74
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,840
<i>There you go. As if by chance!</i>

75
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,880
Okay.

76
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,760
Look there. There's something there.

77
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:16,240
"Restart the current
to activate the surveillance monitors.

78
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,560
Find the transformer box in the basement."

79
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,280
Why the basement, bro? Stop!

80
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,240
Find the box...

81
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,800
"The cellars are dangerous.
You risk bothering the bats

82
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,160
with noise and light.
Noom should go alone."

83
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,320
No!

84
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,800
No!

85
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,640
Like in horror films,
the black guy always dies first.

86
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,520
That stinks, like ammonia.

87
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,000
Hold on. What's this?

88
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:54,640
Fucking rats! Do they want to kill me?

89
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,560
Fuck!

90
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,280
Fuck, I can't!

91
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,160
Fuck, it's huge! I want to die!

92
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:00,800
Fuck, rats!

93
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,280
I can't. Rats, fuck!

94
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,320
Rats!

95
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,440
Why didn't Djimo come here?

96
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,000
Rats! There are rats!

97
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:10,240
I can't!

98
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:13,240
They're so big, you might say rabbits.

99
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,520
Focus!

100
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,640
Okay.

101
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,120
It's not working.

102
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,720
Fuck! I'm hot.

103
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,080
<i>Noom sees two little mice,</i>
<i>and he's already about to die.</i>

104
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,280
- Are you okay, Noom?
- Look at how hot I am. I'm sweating.

105
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,200
Rats!

106
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,160
<i>All right. To determine</i>
<i>who's to be the most scared tonight,</i>

107
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,240
<i>we'll start the paranormal missions.</i>

108
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,200
First folder.

109
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:45,040
"In the 19th century,
this hospital welcomed Jean Brassau,

110
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,720
a patient said to have been
possessed by the devil.

111
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,320
He died within the hospital walls

112
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:51,960
with a crucifix in hand
after several weeks of isolation.

113
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:55,200
- He will maybe respond via music."
- Via music? That sounds like shit.

114
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,280
<i>No! It's well known</i>

115
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,120
<i>that music has virtues</i>
<i>for clearing energy.</i>

116
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
<i>It's practical to exorcise rooms. </i>

117
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,720
<i>So the possessed spirit of Jean</i>
<i>should show itself with sketchy noises</i>

118
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,880
<i>thanks to an old ukulele piece, </i>

119
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,920
<i>played by the musician of the group, Lola.</i>

120
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,480
<i>Jean, you're so nice</i>

121
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,080
<i>Jean, you're so nice</i>

122
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,240
<i>I want to meet you</i>

123
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,280
<i>We'll go for pizza</i>

124
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,640
- It's time to go, Lola.
- I'm not well.

125
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,480
MISSION ONE
JEAN THE POSSESSED

126
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,400
Djimo?

127
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,440
- Yes?
- Yes?

128
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,600
<i>- Walkie-talkie to say to go right.</i>
- You should go right.

129
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:34,040
<i>Control monitor to see Lola.</i>

130
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,120
We see you. Go forward a little.

131
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,920
<i>Noom and Djimo</i>
<i>can watch everything from HQ.</i>

132
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,680
I'm freaking out all alone.

133
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,640
No, I'm not feeling well at all!

134
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,000
What would really scare me
would be seeing a ghost,

135
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,440
something that surprised me.
That could make me leave.

136
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,160
She's completely fucked.

137
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,160
We're gonna do everything so she fucks up.

138
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,520
No, I'm not going.
I swear, one of you has to come.

139
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,520
There's nothing. I swear. We can see.

140
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,400
<i>- There's nothing at all.</i>
- No! Fuck!

141
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:04,400
- I swear, this isn't funny.
<i>- We see it all.</i>

142
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,840
But there's nothing! There's a chair...

143
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,520
<i>Jean, I'm nice</i>

144
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,040
<i>Jean, I'm friendly</i>

145
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,320
<i>Jean, are you there?</i>

146
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,360
<i>Jean, you're nice</i>

147
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,720
<i>I don't doubt it</i>

148
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,160
I have something in my bag.
We can freak her out.

149
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:38,800
Let's do it.

150
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,840
- <i>There's nothing, guys.</i>
- Let's tell her to come back.

151
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,880
- We can freak her out on the way back.
- Okay.

152
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:47,120
We came up with a plan to freak Lola out.

153
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:50,880
We're dressing up as ghosts.
She's gonna freak out!

154
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,600
<i>Let's hope so!</i>

155
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,880
<i>Because the costume budget was big.</i>

156
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,960
<i>With such means, we can be sure</i>
<i>that something crazy will happen to Lola,</i>

157
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:01,120
<i>but it won't be on account of them.</i>

158
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,960
<i>Jean, can you tell me if you're there?</i>

159
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,560
<i>Jean, can you tell me if you're there?</i>

160
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,680
<i>Jean, can you tell me if you're there?</i>

161
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,080
<i>Jean, can you tell me if you're here?</i>

162
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,200
No!

163
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,600
Holy fuck!

164
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,960
Holy fuck. Something fell!

165
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,160
I'm coming back. I'm out of here!
I'm leaving!

166
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,480
Fuck!

167
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,840
Fucking shit!

168
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,920
Guys!

169
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,040
Guys!

170
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,560
Guys!

171
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,280
I was too freaked out.

172
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,280
I'm sure he was there.

173
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,800
I'm totally sure.

174
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,120
I'm... Guys?

175
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,600
Really, you're total assholes.

176
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,240
<i>Enter Jean's ghost...</i>

177
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,040
Holy shit!

178
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,400
<i>And the ghosts of Noom and Djimo.</i>

179
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,920
<i>Lola gets closer to the punishment</i>
<i>destined for the most scared.</i>

180
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,360
<i>But come on! You can't give up</i>
<i>and you have overcome your fears...</i>

181
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,120
FOUR HOURS AND 30 MINUTES BEFORE DAWN

182
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,560
<i>...in this creepy hospital.</i>

183
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:32,160
"Some of the sick who were possessed
or had psychiatric issues

184
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,080
were attached to pillars in the solarium

185
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,960
at times when their soul
could be purified by the sun.

186
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,920
Can you attach yourself
to one of the pillars?

187
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,840
I can't.

188
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,920
- I say I can't.
- I can't at all. I can really feel souls.

189
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:49,280
I can.

190
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,480
- What?
- What?

191
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,400
<i>Apparently, Djimo wants to prove</i>
<i>the most scared tonight will not be him.</i>

192
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:57,560
<i>In any case, for Lola,</i>

193
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,600
<i>this is the perfect chance</i>
<i>to get her revenge.</i>

194
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,880
They're sending me to take a little nap.

195
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,440
You're not there to sleep.
You're there to suffer.

196
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,840
This reminds me of when I worked
at an S&M club.

197
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,200
- We're covering your eyes now.
- You're insane. No!

198
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,200
- You wanted to be the man, bro.
- No.

199
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:17,760
You said you could do it.

200
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,360
- Fuck.
- Don't worry.

201
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,960
Bro, it's nothing.

202
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,440
- There?
- We're gonna attach you there.

203
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,080
Where are you gonna attach me now?

204
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,880
- Don't worry.
- Your ordeal has only just begun.

205
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,680
Guys!

206
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,400
<i>I'm gonna get back at Djimo</i>
<i>for the ghosts.</i>

207
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,440
- I'm listening.
- I'm not telling you. You'll see.

208
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,480
That's enough, guys!

209
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,760
<i>Who's there?</i>

210
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,240
<i>What's that?</i>

211
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,280
Son of a bitch! Asshole! Go!

212
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:13,880
<i>Rats! Fucking jerks!</i>

213
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,040
<i>Not a rat!</i>

214
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,720
Get it off me!

215
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,600
I really got you, bro.

216
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,360
Well done!

217
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,680
<i>Djimo!</i>

218
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,040
What?

219
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:24,960
<i>Are you okay?</i>

220
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,040
No!

221
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,920
- I'm coming.
- Fuck, what's that?

222
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,200
- I can't help you, bro.
- Son of a bitch!

223
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,720
Fuck, there are rats!

224
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,320
- Fucking shit!
- Wait!

225
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,400
Careful! They're gonna devour your balls.

226
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,600
They're gonna devour your balls. Wait!

227
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,520
Lola! She's not scared of rats.

228
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:48,640
Lola!

229
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,920
Fuck, it's huge!

230
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,360
You're not brave men.

231
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,920
- I don't like rats at all.
- You're chickens!

232
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,240
Come on, HQ, friends.

233
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,200
HQ!

234
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,120
I'm super happy with my prank!

235
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,120
<i>Well done, Lola.</i>

236
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,840
TWO HOURS AND 45 MINUTES BEFORE DAWN

237
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,440
<i>While getting back at Djimo,</i>
<i>she also freaked Noom out.</i>

238
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:11,040
<i>But let's get back to work. Tonight's</i>
<i>second paranormal mission is on.</i>

239
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,960
"A few years ago, on the ground floor,

240
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,120
the surgery area
was completely burned down.

241
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,120
In this toxic universe,
ghosts are always present.

242
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,480
They show themselves
through different forms of heat.

243
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,200
Thanks to this thermal camera,

244
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,000
you're going to verify
if any souls still live there.

245
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,600
The chosen ones:

246
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,520
Noom and Lola."

247
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,760
- Fuck!
- Don't--

248
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,360
- I won't scare you.
- No, no pranks.

249
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,040
I raise my hand. No pranks.

250
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,680
<i>Friendship is beautiful.</i>

251
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,920
No pranks.

252
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,200
<i>Well, anyway, let's go.</i>
<i>Let's put on our pretty little outfits.</i>

253
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,000
<i>Careful of the debris</i>
<i>in the burned zone on the ground floor.</i>

254
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,640
Great, guys. Let's go.
I'm counting on you.

255
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,120
Go ahead. Count on us, bro.

256
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:01,040
MISSION TWO
BURNED ZONE

257
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,680
Djimo, where do we go?

258
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,520
- You're sure it was there?
<i>- Right.</i>

259
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,280
Look, hard hat required.

260
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,800
- Not another heat source.
- It stinks.

261
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,440
<i>Lola and Noom go off</i>
<i>in search of the heat source.</i>

262
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:18,080
<i>And we won't mention the radiator,</i>

263
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,800
<i>just a ghost consumed</i>
<i>by the flames of Hell.</i>

264
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:25,640
<i>Just saying that freaks me out.</i>

265
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,400
Put the camera in front.

266
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,800
- Put the camera in front.
- Something just passed by.

267
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,040
Put the camera in front.

268
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:37,360
What is is?

269
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:42,000
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

270
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,280
Are you okay, Djimo?

271
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:45,160
Djimo?

272
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,640
- Man, let's go back up.
<i>- </i>No, we have to explore the room.

273
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,640
Today, they're gonna get
the scare of the their lives.

274
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,280
I'm gonna kill them.

275
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,640
Let's go back to back.
I'll watch the rear, you watch the front.

276
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:58,080
It was really burned here.

277
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,960
When you look at the wall like this,
there's nothing...

278
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,400
- What?
- I swear there was a noise!

279
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,080
- I made a noise.
- No.

280
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,280
- It was me. I knocked on the door.
- No, there.

281
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:10,520
- There was a sound.
- Wait. Don't move.

282
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,560
Look with the thermal camera, please.

283
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,440
What was that?

284
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,600
There's a heat presence there.
I admit there was something.

285
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,280
- Wait. What's that?
- It smells like fire, man.

286
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,680
I'm gonna make them crack.

287
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,520
Hold on. Slowly.

288
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,640
- There's smoke! Let's get out of here!
- What's that?

289
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,960
Stop screaming! You're scaring me!
Hold on.

290
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,680
Fuck! Son of a bitch!

291
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:35,320
Asshole!

292
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,080
I knew you were gonna... I knew it!

293
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,160
I was stuck on the smell of fire.

294
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,320
- So, what did you see?
- First, we have to take a break.

295
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,280
We saw three dots on the wall.

296
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,200
- I'm not well.
- What did you see?

297
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,880
There were three dots on the wall.

298
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:53,040
I so feel like leaving.

299
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,960
Since you didn't respond,
I thought you'd come freak us out.

300
00:14:56,240 --> 00:15:00,400
From that point on, I was focused on you
and I was ready for anything.

301
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,080
I'm not well.

302
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,000
<i>At the moment, Lola and Djimo</i>
<i>have played their best pranks.</i>

303
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,400
<i>Noom awaits his turn.</i>

304
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:18,920
<i>But there's not much time since</i>
<i>there's only one mission left before dawn.</i>

305
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,600
ONE HOUR AND 30 MINUTES BEFORE DAWN

306
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,080
"In the 1960s, a young boy named Léon

307
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:26,680
lived in the hospital's apartment
with his parents for nearly 12 years.

308
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,800
Since then, the young boy's voice
has been heard multiple times

309
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,200
by a succession
of hospital security guards.

310
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,320
Goal of the mission:
go to that apartment to play

311
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,840
'Red Light, Green Light' with Léon.

312
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,200
Don't forget your bag
with the presence detectors."

313
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,200
<i>This high-tech device captures</i>
<i>variations in the electromagnetic field.</i>

314
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,880
<i>When a ghost is in the vicinity,</i>
<i>it will beep and flash.</i>

315
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:03,280
<i>It's a little like at an auto shop,</i>
<i>but I assure you it works.</i>

316
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,360
"The chosen one: Djimo!

317
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:10,200
Note: The key to the apartment included."

318
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,280
You took my finger, man!

319
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,120
Look. He doesn't feel like going.

320
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,800
MISSION THREE
LÉON'S ROOM

321
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,040
Fucking motherfucker.

322
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:46,040
What is this fucking room?

323
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,680
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

324
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,120
<i>We hear you really bad.</i>

325
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,560
Do you hear us?

326
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,840
It's okay. I hear you.

327
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,520
I'll explain to you quickly.

328
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,240
You have to set up
and turn on the three detectors

329
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,920
in a line behind you

330
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,880
so you can see if he gets closer
during the game.

331
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,080
- What?
- Asshole.

332
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,800
<i>Fuck!</i>

333
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,400
You have to find a wall to play the game
and set up the presence detectors

334
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,520
in three different spots
in a line behind you.

335
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:24,560
<i>If little Léon's spirit is there,</i>

336
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,320
<i>they're gonna detect it.</i>

337
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:29,080
<i>But since it's a very sensitive device,</i>

338
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:31,880
<i>Djimo needs to place them very delicately.</i>

339
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:37,240
Djimo, you have to turn off
the walkie-talkie, face the wall,

340
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,400
and ask Léon to play with you.

341
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:40,320
Fuck.

342
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:45,720
Okay.

343
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,440
Do you want to play
"Red Light, Green Light" with me?

344
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:55,640
Red light!

345
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,720
Red light!

346
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:12,960
Red light!

347
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,040
The detector.

348
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:18,240
<i>Hold on!</i>

349
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,800
- What's that?
<i>- I turned that toy off.</i>

350
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:27,920
Stop with your
"I turned that toy off" shit. Wait!

351
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,440
It's starting to get crazy.

352
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,000
<i>The detector detected some stuff. Fuck.</i>

353
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,480
That asshole is here.

354
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,960
It's super nerve-wracking.

355
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,640
I'm gonna try.

356
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,840
- Do you want to go?
<i>- Djimo, come back.</i>

357
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,160
<i>We're gonna switch.</i>

358
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:46,440
That's crazy.

359
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,720
The room is already scary as hell,

360
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:50,120
and the boy was there.

361
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,760
The boy was there.
Noom, didn't you want to go?

362
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,200
- It's my turn to go.
- You want to go do it?

363
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,320
<i>Noom is a little too motivated.</i>

364
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,280
<i>Doesn't it smell like a prank?</i>

365
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,800
<i>Seeing as he went to the basement</i>
<i>to turn on the lights,</i>

366
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,640
<i>he also knows how to turn them off.</i>

367
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:10,080
Fuck, the lights went out!

368
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,840
They all went out! Fuck!

369
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,320
Noom! Please! Fuck!

370
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,800
- Fuck! What's going on?
- It's too weird.

371
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,720
- I'm gonna go.
- I'm coming with you.

372
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,560
Look behind. I'll look ahead.

373
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:33,200
Noom.

374
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:34,800
Noom.

375
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,120
Fuck! Why are we here?

376
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,880
Noom, fuck. Respond.

377
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:48,840
Noom.

378
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,240
He's gonna be in the closet.
Did you see him before?

379
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,680
Son of a bitch!

380
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,680
I hate you! Fuck! Die!

381
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,520
THIRTY MINUTES BEFORE DAWN

382
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,680
You're such an asshole.

383
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,120
That's what I was saying.
You're both total assholes.

384
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,680
The goal was to make you freak out.
There you go.

385
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:21,040
- If I can scare people...
- Mission accomplished.

386
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:21,960
Thanks.

387
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,360
<i>After that last stunt from Noom,</i>

388
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,400
<i>the sun is rising</i>
<i>over the old abandoned hospital.</i>

389
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:31,120
<i>It's time for Lola, Noom, and Djimo</i>

390
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,720
<i>to decide...</i>

391
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,800
Who was the biggest chicken tonight?

392
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,520
We have to vote. I propose everyone say
who was the biggest chicken on three.

393
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,520
- Okay.
- One...

394
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:42,440
two...

395
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,240
three.

396
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,160
- Djimo!
- Lola!

397
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,680
That's true.

398
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:49,080
You freaked out.

399
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:50,800
- The biggest chicken?
- Yeah, you.

400
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,560
Did you see his face in the room?
His eyes?

401
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:55,680
He was freaking out so much,
they were blue.

402
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:00,440
- On the bed with the rats.
- He was not okay.

403
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,440
You both said Djimo?

404
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,880
- We both did say Djimo.
- There you go, in any case.

405
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:10,160
THE PUNISHMENT

406
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,360
- See you!
- See you never!

407
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,160
Big kiss.

408
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,240
Don't leave me here.

409
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,960
<i>Kisses for the ghosts</i>

410
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,640
- Bye.
- Don't leave me here! Fuck!

411
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,400
- Goodbye, hospital!
- Let's go. It's time.

412
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,920
Motherfuckers, come and untie me!

413
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,280
Bye, Djimo!

414
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:37,080
Fuck!

415
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:40,680
Come and untie me!
