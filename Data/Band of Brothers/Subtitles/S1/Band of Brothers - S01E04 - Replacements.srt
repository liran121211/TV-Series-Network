1
00:02:30,733 --> 00:02:35,779
The Toccoa men, that's the ones
that was there at the very beginning.

2
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:39,533
They are very close and...

3
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:43,912
They accept people coming in,
like myself as a replacement...

4
00:02:44,122 --> 00:02:46,915
...but you also had to prove yourself.

5
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:51,336
Most of them were-- We know were
qualified parachutists. They had to be.

6
00:02:51,588 --> 00:02:55,591
A lot of them were awfully green,
and we knew that. We just--

7
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,719
We hoped we could keep them alive
or they could keep alive.

8
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,430
A lot of them didn't. But...

9
00:03:02,348 --> 00:03:07,144
It was all right,
they eventually blend right in.

10
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:10,022
I think maybe they were trying to...

11
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:16,320
...impress the older guys,
maybe people like me or Shifty or...

12
00:03:16,571 --> 00:03:19,781
I don't know why,
but I got right there to where...

13
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:24,411
...I didn't wanna be friendly
with replacements coming in...

14
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:27,497
...because, God, I didn't like
seeing them get killed.

15
00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:29,750
I just-- It just tore me up.

16
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,878
Because we were in awe of them. They
were-- They were wearing infantry badges...

17
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:38,342
...you know, on their uniform.
They had a star on their jump wings. They--

18
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:43,555
They were like heroes to us, you know.
That's how we looked at them.

19
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:46,683
And they were good.
Furthermore, they were good.

20
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:50,979
We had good officers, for the most part,
but we had excellent NCOs.

21
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,232
They looked-- They looked after you.

22
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:21,718
All right, now, lieutenant,
nice and easy. We still got a shot.

23
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,220
Oh!

24
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:26,306
Tough break. You're having a tough night.
People have tough nights.

25
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:29,226
- Sorry, George.
- It's all right.

26
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:32,271
- Nice shot, sir.
- Thank you, Bull.

27
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,274
- Thank you, lieutenant.
- Heffron, finish me up.

28
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:36,984
What does he need? What does he need?

29
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,236
- Double seven.
- There he goes.

30
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:41,863
Hey, there it is!

31
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,075
You're embarrassing the lieutenant here.
Have a drink.

32
00:04:45,285 --> 00:04:47,202
Don't mind if I do, sarge.

33
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:50,163
Better start winning money soon. I think
your buddies are starting to miss you.

34
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,207
Yeah, they do look kind of sad,
don't they?

35
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,335
They just serious fighting men, that's all.

36
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:58,005
Well, I think I'm gonna
go introduce myself.

37
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:01,842
Be careful what you say, now.
It don't take much to set my guys off.

38
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,720
Yeah, you got some
wild-eyed killers right there, Bull.

39
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:06,388
You know, it's a good thing
we weren't gambling.

40
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:07,806
Oh, boy, we would've gotten killed.

41
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:09,182
- You wanna bet?
- What?

42
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,767
- You wanna bet?
- Yeah, a pack of smokes.

43
00:05:10,935 --> 00:05:12,894
- Come on, we'll have another game.
- I don't know much about gambling.

44
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,062
- Pack of smokes.
- Hey, come on.

45
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:16,982
- First one to hit the bull's-eye?
- Yeah, okay, one shot. One shot.

46
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,233
- Yeah, why not?
- Yeah?

47
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,526
- Make it two.
- Two packs.

48
00:05:19,736 --> 00:05:20,902
- Two packs each.
- All right, two packs.

49
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,447
Here we go, here we go. One shot.
Here we go, Georgie.

50
00:05:23,614 --> 00:05:27,117
Hey, fellas. What do you hear?
What do you say?

51
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,578
Actually, that's Babe's seat.
Private Heffron's.

52
00:05:29,746 --> 00:05:33,165
Is that right? I don't care
if it's fucking Eisenhower's.

53
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:42,007
- Who are you?
- Private Miller. James Miller.

54
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:45,844
- I'm in Sergeant Randleman's squad.
- Us too. I'm Les Hashey.

55
00:05:46,095 --> 00:05:48,263
- Tony--
- Garcia. I know who you are.

56
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:51,391
Old Gonorrhea don't miss nothing.

57
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:55,145
Lieutenant, are you gonna
shoot lefty all night?

58
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:57,272
- Hey, come on.
- I'm just curious because he's right-handed.

59
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,318
George. What would I do
without George Luz?

60
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:02,861
Oh!

61
00:06:03,071 --> 00:06:05,322
- Goodness gracious!
- Two packs, gentlemen.

62
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,782
I know you got them. Pay up.

63
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:11,620
- So Heffron tell you about Doris yet?
- No.

64
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:15,999
Well, then I'm gonna educate you.

65
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,753
We're getting ready to get on the plane for
that first frog town we never jumped into.

66
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:22,297
All of a sudden,
Heffron stops dead in his tracks.

67
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:25,425
Bing and bang and boom, everybody
banging into each other and everything.

68
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:29,554
Heffron's just staring up at the nose
of the plane because on it...

69
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:34,684
...is painted this beautiful pinup.
And written underneath, "Darling Doris."

70
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:39,606
Doris just happens to be the name
of the skirt who just that day...

71
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:43,318
...sent Babe one of them letters.
You know the--? The--

72
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,446
Web, what do you call them letters
that the broads send?

73
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:50,117
- Dear John letter.
- That's it. A "Dear Babe" letter.

74
00:06:50,868 --> 00:06:54,746
Well, anyway, lucky for Babe,
Patton overruns our drop zone.

75
00:06:54,956 --> 00:07:00,669
Mission canceled. In other words, Babe don't
have to risk getting inside old Doris again.

76
00:07:03,047 --> 00:07:05,173
Hey, Bull,
your squad listens up real good.

77
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:09,344
Yeah, they're being polite,
like whenever Bull opens his mouth.

78
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:12,514
Johnny, what are you saying?
Bull's boys are just humoring him?

79
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:17,352
Yeah, like whenever he gives out some of his
folksy wisdom from back down on the farm.

80
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:21,690
You probably think he's a fucking hayseed.
Ain't that right?

81
00:07:22,692 --> 00:07:24,734
What are you laughing at?

82
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:38,498
You new boys, you pay attention
to Sergeant Randleman. Got that?

83
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:41,501
That's the smartest man in the company.

84
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:50,343
Hey, Mack.

85
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,054
Where'd you get that?

86
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:57,726
It's the Presidential Distinguished
Unit Citation. For...

87
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:02,981
- For what the regiment did in Normandy.
- That's right. For what the regiment did.

88
00:08:03,191 --> 00:08:05,567
- You weren't there.
- Hey, hey.

89
00:08:05,735 --> 00:08:09,988
Ease up, Cobb. it's a unit citation.

90
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:51,738
Shit, Cobb. You didn't fight
in Normandy, neither.

91
00:08:56,369 --> 00:09:00,747
I got hit in the plane
before I got a chance to jump.

92
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:06,545
Hey, y'all! Listen up!
I got us an announcement to make.

93
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:11,383
- This here is Carwood Lipton.
- He's already married, Smokey.

94
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:17,222
This here is Carwood Lipton,
the new Easy Company first sergeant!

95
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:24,938
As-- As befitting his position, he says
he has to make an announcement.

96
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:32,654
Well, I hate to break the mood here,
boys, but we're moving out again.

97
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:55,802
<i>As you can see...</i>

98
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,681
...this is called
Operation Market Garden.

99
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,852
And in terms of airborne divisions involved,
this one's even bigger than Normandy.

100
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:07,022
We're dropping deep
into occupied Holland.

101
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:12,485
The Allied objective is to take this road
here between Eindhoven and Arnhem...

102
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:16,406
...so the two British armored divisions
can move up it toward Arnhem.

103
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:20,201
Our job is gonna be
to liberate Eindhoven...

104
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,372
...stay there, wait for the tanks.

105
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:29,044
The entire European advance
has been put on hold...

106
00:10:29,211 --> 00:10:32,380
...to allocate resources for this operation.

107
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:35,383
It's Montgomery's personal plan,
we'll be under British command.

108
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:36,551
Yippee.

109
00:10:36,719 --> 00:10:41,598
The good news is, if this works, these tanks
will be over the Rhine and into Germany.

110
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:45,560
That could end the war,
get us home by Christmas.

111
00:10:45,936 --> 00:10:48,813
It'll be a daytime jump. Intelligence
doesn't expect much opposition.

112
00:10:49,065 --> 00:10:53,276
They think the Krauts in Holland
are mostly kids and old men.

113
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,320
And we should take them by surprise.

114
00:10:55,571 --> 00:11:00,450
In any case, say goodbye to England.
I don't think they're gonna call this one off.

115
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:26,518
- What are you doing?
- Look at Cobb, man.

116
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:32,982
Watch and learn, kids.
You wanna live, jump ready to fight.

117
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,069
Someone help me
with this belly strap, will you?

118
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:47,288
Move it!

119
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:40,508
- No! Come on.
- Yes, sir.

120
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:44,512
They let you out of the hospital
like that, boy?

121
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,183
They didn't let me out. I busted out.

122
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:50,518
I didn't wanna get reassigned
to some other unit.

123
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:52,353
Yeah? Can you make the jump?

124
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:56,608
Oh, sure I can, Lip. I just can't sit.

125
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:59,110
- Welcome back, Popeye.
- Thanks, Bull.

126
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,199
- Popeye went AWOL just in time to jump.
- What's he doing here?

127
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,703
Who, Sobel? Well, he's the newly
appointed regimental S-4.

128
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:12,457
- Supply officer?
- Yeah, you got it.

129
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,668
Yeah, he picked me up in Aldbourne,
trying to find you guys.

130
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,798
- He know you went AWOL?
- He knows.

131
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:24,135
He just said I was lucky.
I could sit out this jump if I wanted.

132
00:13:24,386 --> 00:13:28,348
- I said I didn't want to. So he says, "Hop in."
- "Hop in"?

133
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,391
Yeah, I know. I couldn't believe it either.

134
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,894
Anyway, maybe he's gonna
court-martial me later, huh?

135
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,396
Let's get you some gear.

136
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,151
This here would be a nice bivouac position.

137
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,070
Hey, Mal...

138
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,363
...over there.

139
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:47,033
Son of a bitch.

140
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:56,042
Malarkey.

141
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:05,009
- Sergeant Malarkey.
- Sir.

142
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:13,351
You thought you'd get away with it?

143
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,062
What do you mean, sir?

144
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:24,279
Sergeant, that motorcycle
is United States Army property.

145
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:28,366
That may not mean anything to you,
but it means something to me.

146
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:30,952
Where'd you find it?

147
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:34,289
- That's him, all right.
- Who is he, sarge?

148
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,958
- He was our first C.O.
- What happened?

149
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,835
He got promoted.

150
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:41,504
Just tap my leg, sergeant.

151
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:47,051
- Lieutenant, you'll be in the doorway.
- Yeah, I know. But, look, sergeant...

152
00:14:47,303 --> 00:14:49,053
...you'll be the man behind me.

153
00:14:49,221 --> 00:14:52,849
When the green light comes on,
you can just tap me, all right?

154
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:57,228
- The green light will be next to you, sir.
- Just do it. That's an order.

155
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:59,439
Come here. Come here.

156
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:02,108
Sling it up and down. When you hit
the ground, your knee will hit the butt...

157
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,735
...but the business end will break your jaw.

158
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,987
All right? Lose your reserve.
You won't need it, we're jumping low.

159
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,657
Take your belly band and
wrap it around you. You're fine.

160
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,656
Come on.

161
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:44,085
- I'm sorry, sergeant.
- Don't be sorry. Grab your rifle, let's go.

162
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,152
Where'd you get that from, Hoobler?

163
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:19,370
I think I love Holland.

164
00:17:19,788 --> 00:17:23,791
- Where'd you get these?
- That farmhouse over there.

165
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:28,129
Just sitting out in the open.
I don't know...

166
00:17:28,338 --> 00:17:31,466
...maybe they were expecting us.

167
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,721
Hello, boys.

168
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:41,476
I made it.

169
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:44,896
I wonder if they hit anything.

170
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,239
Goodbye, air support.

171
00:17:58,035 --> 00:18:03,164
There's some kind of holdup ahead.
We're going in through this field here.

172
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,628
Move out! Able Company,
let's go! Let's go! Move it! Move it!

173
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:25,061
You won't be able to shoot as straight
with that thing on.

174
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:52,588
Okay, hold your fire.

175
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,905
Hey, kid!

176
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:22,618
- Bull? Bull! Have you seen Captain Winters?
- No, why?

177
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:25,746
Keep your squad moving!

178
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:33,671
- Where are all the Germans?
- They could be anywhere.

179
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:38,885
Keep moving! Keep moving!

180
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,847
Pardon me.

181
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,477
Come on, lady.

182
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:54,734
- Dick, the clock's ticking.
- Yeah.

183
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:58,779
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Thank you.

184
00:19:58,947 --> 00:20:02,283
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you, you're very kind.

185
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:03,951
- Thank you.
- What's up, Welshy?

186
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:06,204
Snipers.

187
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,332
We've gotta get to these bridges.

188
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:13,002
All right.

189
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:14,754
Hashey.

190
00:20:20,302 --> 00:20:22,720
- Ready?
- Okay, everybody, here we go.

191
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,513
Give me a kiss.

192
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:30,186
Sergeant Talbert, let's move.
We got work to do.

193
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:40,673
- What did they do?
- They slept with the Germans.

194
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,010
They are lucky. The men who
collaborated are being shot.

195
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:48,055
Mr. van Kooijk here
is with the Dutch Resistance.

196
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:52,351
We've been waiting and hoping
for this day for almost five years.

197
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,062
He says he can help us
secure the bridges here.

198
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:58,733
Yes. Together we can push the
remaining Germans out of Eindhoven.

199
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,735
And that's just the beginning.

200
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:05,906
- Any idea where they might be?
- Well, we're still working on that right now.

201
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,368
Peers and his friends here
are gathering information as we speak.

202
00:22:09,619 --> 00:22:13,497
His contacts a couple towns down said they
saw the British 2nd and Guards Armored...

203
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:14,999
...move through half an hour ago.

204
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:18,627
- They're kids.
- These are reliable reports.

205
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:22,715
Anything we can do to help you,
we will do. Anything.

206
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,552
Right on time.

207
00:22:45,989 --> 00:22:47,281
Captain.

208
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:50,951
I'll be happy to show you
the quickest route to the bridges.

209
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,418
I'd be happy to have your help.

210
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:03,506
Get scouts to the edge of town
in case we're here for the night.

211
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:22,441
Hey, van Klinken. Webster.

212
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:27,446
Sleeping outside is for suckers, guys.

213
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:34,120
Better be good. I was almost asleep.

214
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:49,093
- Yeah. Yeah, a little bit.
- What were you doing down there?

215
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:54,890
It's an air-raid shelter. My family has been
in there ever since the first plane flew over.

216
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:58,853
We're-- We're Americans. Paratroopers.

217
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:04,859
- The Germans are gone?
- Think so. You see any, you let us know.

218
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:07,570
- Are you here to stay?
- As long as we have to.

219
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:11,782
- Yeah, they don't tell us very much.
- Or feed us much.

220
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:16,454
Please, wait here.

221
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:21,959
- You see that? I say screw Paris.
- Hey, don't talk about screwing, all right?

222
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:26,213
They all speak English, they all love us.
What a fantastic country.

223
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:27,965
Hey, take a look.

224
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:31,343
Here. Take.

225
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,596
- Here, take.
- Are these olives?

226
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,265
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

227
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:44,982
Yeah.

228
00:25:16,723 --> 00:25:19,308
He never tasted chocolate.

229
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:31,111
It's pretty good, isn't it?

230
00:25:57,681 --> 00:26:02,810
- Oh, man, you know, I hate eggs!
- Here, sarge, you can have this one!

231
00:26:08,483 --> 00:26:13,070
- Vincent van Gogh was born in Nuenen.
- Yeah? So what?

232
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:17,825
They sure teach you a lot
of useful stuff at Harvard.

233
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:31,171
Mellet!

234
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:03,120
- Hey, get a load of General Patton!
- What the hell's he doing?

235
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:06,415
- Makes quite a target, don't he?
- You can't be off the tank.

236
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,045
Lieutenant!

237
00:27:13,632 --> 00:27:15,007
Sniper!

238
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:16,675
Sarge!

239
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:24,141
Clear the tracks! Move it!
Get behind the tanks!

240
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:26,393
- Shit!
- Come on! Come on!

241
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,606
Come on, get in the ditch!

242
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:45,496
Medic up front! Medic up front!

243
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:51,502
- What should we do?
- Keep down. Stay still.

244
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:57,925
- Keep moving! Get up! Keep moving!
- Go!

245
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:02,054
Keep-- Go! Keep moving!

246
00:28:03,932 --> 00:28:06,433
Let's go! Move out!

247
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:12,231
Up and move! Move! Keep moving!
They shoot at stationary targets! Move!

248
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:26,078
To the farmhouse! Deploy right!

249
00:28:35,338 --> 00:28:37,548
- Take the right side.
- Right.

250
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,216
Go!

251
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,349
Go on!

252
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:19,673
Kraut!

253
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:25,304
- Shit!
- Move! Goddamn it, move!

254
00:29:25,638 --> 00:29:28,432
Go! Come on! Come on!

255
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:44,865
- What's he saying?
- He said "away, away."

256
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:49,953
Which either means that the Germans have
gone or he wants us to go. I don't know.

257
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,258
Go! Go!

258
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:21,401
Ramirez!

259
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,707
Beat it!

260
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:40,295
All right, fellas, set them up.

261
00:31:14,998 --> 00:31:16,039
Tiger.

262
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,297
Shit.

263
00:31:31,848 --> 00:31:34,558
Heffron! On me!

264
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,980
Stay low.

265
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:46,612
- You got a can opener, Babe?
- I'm afraid I don't, sarge.

266
00:31:53,953 --> 00:31:58,582
We got a Kraut tank, 100 yards
on the left part of this haystack!

267
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:01,126
I don't see him.

268
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:04,838
Put a couple of shells through that
building, you're gonna see him real good.

269
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:09,635
I can't. My orders are no unnecessary
destruction of property.

270
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:12,095
I'm telling you, he's right there.

271
00:32:12,305 --> 00:32:14,681
Well, I believe you.
But if I can't see the bugger...

272
00:32:14,849 --> 00:32:17,601
...I can't bloody well shoot him, can I?

273
00:32:17,852 --> 00:32:19,937
Are you staying or going?

274
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:27,319
He's gonna see you real soon!

275
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,824
What the hell is he doing?

276
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,858
Forward! Tank!

277
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,447
- Fall back!
- Go!

278
00:33:12,782 --> 00:33:14,950
- Go!
- Fire!

279
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,264
Fire!

280
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:50,569
Fall back! Fall back!

281
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:54,906
Take cover! Take cover!

282
00:34:14,427 --> 00:34:18,472
There's a ditch on the other side.
Follow me through.

283
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:25,145
Van Klinken!

284
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,474
Bull!

285
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:06,853
Pull back! Pull back!
Let's go! Let's go!

286
00:35:10,525 --> 00:35:12,651
Come on, move! Go!

287
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,155
Fire!

288
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,493
Rifle grenade!

289
00:35:21,744 --> 00:35:26,123
Schmidt, MG42, 10 o'clock. Nail them!

290
00:35:27,041 --> 00:35:28,625
Fire!

291
00:35:47,145 --> 00:35:49,104
- We had to leave him.
- It's okay, he--

292
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:50,397
- He's still alive!
- Who's hurt?

293
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:53,984
Van Klinken. Other side of that hedge.

294
00:35:55,611 --> 00:35:57,737
Shit!

295
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:05,620
Okay, ready.

296
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,089
Fall back! Fall back!

297
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:18,425
Fall back!

298
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:30,228
Pull back! Pull back!
Alley! Pull back!

299
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:36,109
Go! Pull back!

300
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:42,490
Fall back! Go! Go!

301
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:45,702
- Webster, take over!
- Yeah, where?

302
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:48,038
We have to get him to the rear!

303
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:51,416
- What are we gonna do, lieutenant?
- I'm not sure!

304
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:55,378
Sir, they're about to unflank us!
We gotta get out of here!

305
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,589
Mortar!

306
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:06,806
Fall back!

307
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:09,851
--Cut the road!
We have infantry everywhere!

308
00:37:10,019 --> 00:37:14,064
Repeat, armor has cut the road!
We are covered in infantry!

309
00:37:14,273 --> 00:37:16,441
- Fall back!
- We are pulling back!

310
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:19,569
- Luz, fall back!
- It's a hold-down!

311
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:27,661
- Hash, where's Randleman?
- I don't know, sergeant.

312
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:30,121
Get out of here.

313
00:37:45,388 --> 00:37:47,222
Miller!

314
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:59,734
Come on. Hashey, let's go!

315
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:07,075
Stay low! Get down!

316
00:38:09,996 --> 00:38:11,037
Medic!

317
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,290
Medic!

318
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,503
Go get a medic! Keep moving!

319
00:38:20,172 --> 00:38:21,631
Doc.

320
00:38:23,676 --> 00:38:25,260
- Hey, doc.
- Lieutenant.

321
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:29,347
It's gone right through.
Side to side, both cheeks.

322
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:33,393
- Malarkey, get him out of here! Go!
- What?

323
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:37,480
- Just-- Just leave me here for the Germans.
- What? Are you nuts?

324
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,232
- We'll carry you!
- Are you kidding me?

325
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,818
I weigh more than both of
you two guys combined.

326
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:44,904
Come on!

327
00:38:48,117 --> 00:38:51,077
- What the hell are you doing?!
- Help us!

328
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:56,458
Get back to the tank!
Germans coming up on the other side!

329
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,424
Keep moving! Keep low!

330
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:12,307
Come on, let's go! Let's go!
Come on, up you go.

331
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:15,852
- One bullet, four holes.
- Yup, it's almost a miracle.

332
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,979
Lip, I don't think we know
where the Bull is.

333
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:21,066
- Keep it moving, sergeant.
- Yes, sir.

334
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:24,861
Let's go, let's go! Let's go, go!
Keep moving! Keep moving!

335
00:39:25,112 --> 00:39:27,072
Move them out! Let's go!

336
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,324
Hurry it up! Let's go! Let's go!

337
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:33,745
- How bad?
- I don't know yet.

338
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:35,955
Nix!

339
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:39,459
I'm all right! I'm all right.
Am I all right?

340
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:44,047
- Yeah. Yeah, you feel all right?
- Yeah. Quit looking at me like that.

341
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:51,554
Captain, we got four dead, 11 injured.

342
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:56,309
- Okay, let's move them out.
- Oh, and sir, Randleman's missing too.

343
00:39:56,560 --> 00:39:58,937
- Randleman?
- Yes, sir.

344
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:01,022
Okay, let's go.

345
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:38,017
- Where's the Bull?
- Don't know.

346
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:13,590
I never fired a shot the whole time.

347
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:21,723
- Find anything out?
- About what?

348
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:23,600
Anything.

349
00:43:25,477 --> 00:43:28,187
What we're doing next?

350
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,481
Nope.

351
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:35,737
Oh, I did hear one thing.
Lieutenant Brewer's gonna make it.

352
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:39,657
- What?
- Lieutenant Brewer's gonna make it.

353
00:43:39,908 --> 00:43:41,868
- No, there's no way.
- He's headed back to England.

354
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,786
They'll probably send him home.

355
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,872
How is that possible?

356
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,750
He did turn his head
at the last second...

357
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:51,878
...when Sergeant Randleman
called out to him.

358
00:45:15,838 --> 00:45:18,131
- Here.
- No.

359
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:27,265
Just pu-- Fuck!

360
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:29,934
Just pull it out.

361
00:46:34,625 --> 00:46:36,709
Come on.

362
00:46:40,005 --> 00:46:42,131
- Okay.
- Here.

363
00:46:45,052 --> 00:46:47,345
Go! Go.

364
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:24,460
Hoob, any news on the Bull yet?

365
00:49:27,923 --> 00:49:33,761
If there ain't no body, then there ain't
nobody fucking dead. Understand me?

366
00:49:33,971 --> 00:49:35,638
I'm gonna look for him.

367
00:49:35,847 --> 00:49:40,142
Not by yourself, you're not.
I'll go with you. Let me get some ammo.

368
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:42,311
That's okay...

369
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:46,023
- ...I'll go.
- Me too.

370
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:50,653
All right.

371
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:54,615
Go get him.

372
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:05,292
All right. I mean, what the hell.

373
00:50:07,129 --> 00:50:09,839
I ain't going back up there.

374
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:30,067
Webster, us or them?

375
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:36,115
Not us.

376
00:50:57,596 --> 00:51:01,766
Stupid, stupid, stupid.

377
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:19,075
Go, go.

378
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:40,971
They're bombing Eindhoven.

379
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,934
Yeah?

380
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:54,318
Come on, Nix.
We'll dig in for the night.

381
00:51:56,404 --> 00:52:00,366
Won't be waving so many orange flags
at us tomorrow.

382
00:53:38,173 --> 00:53:40,424
Where the fuck you been?

383
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:43,969
- Glad to see you boys.
- Not as glad as us.

384
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,972
Bet you thought we'd given up
on you there, huh, boss?

385
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:49,350
- Shut up, Cobb.
- What?

386
00:53:49,601 --> 00:53:52,978
I think we should go back now.

387
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:56,106
Hey, Johnny, look.

388
00:53:56,691 --> 00:53:57,900
Bull!

389
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:05,074
- Hey, Johnny.
- There you are. You get a little lost?

390
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:07,243
- Something like that.
- It's good to see you.

391
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:08,911
You too.

392
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:13,457
I don't know whether to
slap you, kiss you or salute you.

393
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:16,752
- I told these scallywags you was okay.
- What, they didn't listen?

394
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:20,631
These salty bastards, they wanted to
go on a suicide run to drag your ass back.

395
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:24,718
- Is that right?
- Yeah, I told them don't bother.

396
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:29,223
Never did like this company none.

397
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,018
- Anybody have a piece of gum?
- Here.

398
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:37,606
- So they found you.
- Wait, what did you say?

399
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,108
Johnny, don't irrigate me.

400
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,444
"They found you." Now I don't know
who's more stupid, you or the hick.

401
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:45,447
All right, mount up! Hop up!
Let's move out!

402
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:47,574
Grab your gear! Let's go!

403
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:50,786
2nd Platoon, grab your gear! Let's go!

404
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:54,957
- 1 st Platoon!
- Second squad, fall in now! Cobb, move it!

405
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:57,209
Dukeman, round them up!

406
00:54:57,460 --> 00:55:01,213
1 st Platoon, grab your gear, let's go.

407
00:55:21,735 --> 00:55:25,904
Van Kooijk says that the Germans are
concentrating their armor up near Veghel.

408
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:28,490
We may be heading into
some more tanks.

409
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:32,453
Well, as long as it's
only old men and kids.

410
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:34,330
Yeah.

411
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:38,083
I don't like retreating.

412
00:55:38,293 --> 00:55:41,003
First time for everything.

413
00:55:42,464 --> 00:55:46,216
How are the other divisions
faring up North?

414
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:52,639
I think we're gonna have to find
another way into Germany.
