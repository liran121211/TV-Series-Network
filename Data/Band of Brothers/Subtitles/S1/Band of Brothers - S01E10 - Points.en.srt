1
00:03:05,894 --> 00:03:08,147
WINTERS: <i>It was more
than 3 years since Lewis Nixon...</i>

2
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:11,400
<i>...and I decided to join the paratroops.</i>

3
00:03:11,567 --> 00:03:14,570
<i>And more than a year
since we'd first gone to war.</i>

4
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:19,616
<i>Not knowing what would happen to us.
How long we'd be fighting.</i>

5
00:03:19,783 --> 00:03:22,161
<i>Where we'd end up.</i>

6
00:03:22,328 --> 00:03:26,540
<i>I certainly didn't expect to find
myself in a place like this.</i>

7
00:03:30,002 --> 00:03:32,421
NIXON:
I thought it might be you.

8
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,259
Morning.

9
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:42,181
I heard reports about
a redheaded Eskimo.

10
00:03:43,182 --> 00:03:45,726
Thought I'd check it out.

11
00:03:45,893 --> 00:03:48,145
Come to join me for a morning swim?

12
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:53,525
Yeah. You know me so well.

13
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,737
Here. It's from Zielinski.

14
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:59,239
Oh, great.

15
00:04:03,452 --> 00:04:04,953
What is that?

16
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,123
Ran into the regimental photographer.

17
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:12,503
Said he had all these
photographs of the 506th...

18
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,297
...going all the way back to Toccoa.

19
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:20,219
- I traded them for a couple of Lugers.
- That's a bargain.

20
00:04:30,687 --> 00:04:35,275
- What do you think you'll do after this?
- Get some breakfast.

21
00:04:37,778 --> 00:04:40,280
No. After, after.

22
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:49,581
Well, it's funny you should mention it
because I had a meeting with Col. Sink.

23
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:52,334
- Really?
- Yeah.

24
00:04:52,876 --> 00:04:56,839
Yeah, discussed the possibility
of staying.

25
00:04:57,005 --> 00:04:58,841
In the Army?

26
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:03,053
Yeah. Yeah, as a career.

27
00:05:04,888 --> 00:05:06,932
What'd you say?

28
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:09,601
I said I'd think about it.

29
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:23,031
- What do you think about New Jersey?
- New Jersey?

30
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:27,828
There's a company in Nixon, New Jersey.
It's called Nixon Nitration Works.

31
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:30,330
- Sounds picturesque.
- Yeah, well...

32
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:33,709
...oddly enough, I know the owners.

33
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:38,255
Probably gonna expect me
to make something of myself.

34
00:05:38,464 --> 00:05:41,383
I thought maybe I'd drag you with me.

35
00:05:44,595 --> 00:05:47,723
Are you offering me a job?

36
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:55,856
We'll see how you do in your interview,
but a man of your qualifications...

37
00:05:56,023 --> 00:06:01,570
...I think can probably scrape something up
commensurate with your current salary level.

38
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:07,868
Yeah, I'll think about it.

39
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:13,790
I... I really appreciate it.

40
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:17,127
Yeah, just think about it.

41
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:20,255
Yeah.

42
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,373
WINTERS: <i>Job offers.</i>

43
00:06:54,998 --> 00:06:56,792
<i>Hard to fathom.</i>

44
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:59,753
<i>And the war wasn't even over.</i>

45
00:07:00,212 --> 00:07:04,716
<i>I was still getting used
to hot showers and morning swims.</i>

46
00:07:15,227 --> 00:07:20,232
<i>We'd entered Bavaria in early May with
the hopes of capturing Berchtesgaden.</i>

47
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:25,237
<i>This famous town, high in the Alps,
was the Nazi Party's symbolic home.</i>

48
00:07:25,404 --> 00:07:28,490
<i>And all the heads of the Third Reich
had houses there.</i>

49
00:07:28,657 --> 00:07:32,035
<i>Although Hitler was dead,
he had apparently ordered the SS...</i>

50
00:07:32,202 --> 00:07:34,162
<i>...to make it their last stand
from which to mount...</i>

51
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:37,040
<i>...a guerilla resistance
against the Allied advance.</i>

52
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:41,253
<i>The first step was blocking the roads.</i>

53
00:07:46,258 --> 00:07:48,552
When are we expecting the engineers
to arrive?

54
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:52,514
- Half an hour ago.
- So we're stuck here until they do, Nix.

55
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:56,852
Well, if you're the SS, you're not gonna
let us waltz into Hitler's house.

56
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:59,104
Probably throw a few rocks
at us yourself.

57
00:07:59,271 --> 00:08:01,064
If you're looking for someone
to find another way up that mountain...

58
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:03,442
- ...Easy Company is ready and willing.
- Duly noted.

59
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:05,652
I already recommended you to Col. Sink.

60
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:09,615
- Terrific. Let's go find out where Hitler lived.
- Ron. We're not sure what's up there.

61
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:13,410
The colonel doesn't want us
taking any unnecessary risks.

62
00:08:13,577 --> 00:08:16,913
So the French are gonna beat us
to the Eagle's Nest?

63
00:08:30,427 --> 00:08:33,138
SINK: Gents, I just had
a conversation with Gen. LeClerc.

64
00:08:33,305 --> 00:08:35,098
He told me he was first
into Paris and by God...

65
00:08:35,265 --> 00:08:38,393
...he wanted to be first
into Berchtesgaden.

66
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,315
Told him I understood his point.

67
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:48,487
Now you fire up 2nd Battalion
and outflank that French son of a bitch.

68
00:08:48,654 --> 00:08:50,113
Yes, sir.

69
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:58,455
I want Easy Company in the lead. Have
the men assemble down on the <i>Autobahn</i>.

70
00:08:58,622 --> 00:09:00,332
Yes, sir.

71
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,412
Eerie.

72
00:09:39,246 --> 00:09:41,498
Not even any natives.

73
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:45,836
That's because this is the one town
you can't deny being a true Nazi.

74
00:09:46,086 --> 00:09:49,464
- What do you mean?
- NIXON: Well, you have to be to live here.

75
00:09:49,631 --> 00:09:53,009
We need to find some place
we can put the colonel.

76
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,554
How about right there?

77
00:10:23,832 --> 00:10:25,667
NIXON: No, no.

78
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:49,149
WELSH: Wow.

79
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,828
Kitty would love this.

80
00:11:01,995 --> 00:11:05,665
How many brides get
a wedding present from Hitler?

81
00:11:08,627 --> 00:11:10,670
You wanna take half?

82
00:11:10,837 --> 00:11:12,923
I can't carry all this.

83
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:16,927
You know, whoever comes in here after us is
just gonna take whatever isn't nailed down.

84
00:11:17,093 --> 00:11:20,639
- Well. Wouldn't want that to happen.
- Heh-heh-heh.

85
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,939
- Nice.
- Don't even think about it.

86
00:11:38,281 --> 00:11:41,701
- Maj. Winters. Sir.
- More.

87
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,079
Permission to climb the mountain, sir?
Eagle's Nest?

88
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:47,707
- What is this?
- Wait one minute.

89
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:50,752
Harry, have F Company
put a double guard on the hotel.

90
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:52,879
Set up roadblocks
on the west side of town.

91
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:57,050
I want Battalion HQ, seal off
the north side, and prepare for prisoners.

92
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:59,386
- Sgt. Grant.
- And Harry...

93
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,347
...nobody gets hurt, not now.

94
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,351
And Easy?

95
00:12:07,644 --> 00:12:10,897
Easy will head up the mountain through
the Obersalzburg...

96
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:13,441
...and take the Eagle's Nest.

97
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:18,029
MALARKEY: Hi-yo, Silver!

98
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:26,037
Yeah! Currahee!

99
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:29,332
WINTERS: <i>The Eagle's Nest was a
surprise birthday present for Hitler...</i>

100
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,376
<i>...built with Nazi party money.</i>

101
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:34,629
<i>A mountaintop stone retreat
8000 feet up...</i>

102
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:37,507
<i>...accessible by
a gold-plated elevator.</i>

103
00:12:37,674 --> 00:12:40,844
<i>It was one of the crown jewels
of his empire...</i>

104
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:43,179
<i>...and the man was afraid of heights.</i>

105
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,227
Here's to him.

106
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:47,744
- WELSH: Ha-ha-ha.
- NIXON: No, goddamn it, listen.

107
00:13:48,119 --> 00:13:49,871
Hitler, Hitler... No.

108
00:13:50,038 --> 00:13:56,461
Hitler, Himmler, Goering, Goebbels
and the pope walk into a bar...

109
00:13:56,628 --> 00:14:00,298
- Because he drinks too much...
- WELSH: That's how it starts.

110
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:04,469
Hey, Adolf! Love your Eagle's Nest.
I hope you don't mind.

111
00:14:04,636 --> 00:14:09,724
We made ourselves at home. Love what
you done with the place. Hey, have a drink.

112
00:14:09,891 --> 00:14:13,561
Come on. Just so we can say
we saw you do it.

113
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,230
Listen up.

114
00:14:16,523 --> 00:14:18,566
From Corps, just came in.
Effective immediately.

115
00:14:18,733 --> 00:14:22,654
"All troops stand fast
on present positions."

116
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:26,825
- Standing fast.
- What does that mean?

117
00:14:27,993 --> 00:14:30,203
Wanna hear it? Mm-hm?

118
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:35,375
Ready for it? Listen up.
German army's surrendered.

119
00:14:41,506 --> 00:14:44,884
I got a present for you. Come on.

120
00:14:46,261 --> 00:14:47,887
Is it? Yeah?

121
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,953
- NIXON: What is this place?
- WINTERS: Hermann Goering's house.

122
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,540
We discovered it yesterday.
Had it on double guard ever since.

123
00:15:15,707 --> 00:15:18,752
- O'KEEFE: I can vouch for that, sir.
- Oh, anxious to get off duty, O'Keefe?

124
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:22,297
No, there's just so much
to see and do, sir.

125
00:15:57,665 --> 00:16:01,586
WINTERS: <i>10,000 bottles of the world's
finest liquor, wine and champagne...</i>

126
00:16:01,753 --> 00:16:05,799
<i>...helped Easy Company mark the day
the war in Europe came to an end.</i>

127
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,801
It's all yours.

128
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:12,514
Take what you want and then have
each company take a truckload.

129
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:14,599
We're heading for Austria
in the morning...

130
00:16:14,766 --> 00:16:17,060
...but don't feel you have to leave
anything here for whoever comes here next.

131
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:19,979
- Austria, sir?
- Happy V-E Day.

132
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,233
Yeah.

133
00:16:24,818 --> 00:16:26,736
V-E Day?

134
00:16:27,153 --> 00:16:29,864
Victory in Europe.

135
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:39,290
Happy V-E Day.

136
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:45,713
WINTERS: <i>Instead of an aggressive combat
unit, we became an occupation force.</i>

137
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:50,135
<i>And no one wanted to leave Berchtesgaden.
Until they saw Austria.</i>

138
00:17:27,172 --> 00:17:31,259
So you reckon they'll make us
run up those or ski down them?

139
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:53,156
TROOPER:
Hey, how are you? Need a hand there?

140
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,326
MALARKEY: Hi! Hi! He loves you.

141
00:17:56,659 --> 00:18:00,163
Hey, lady, how are you?

142
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:06,044
I think the war is over!

143
00:18:38,701 --> 00:18:41,120
We'll be comfortable here.

144
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:49,295
GERMAN COLONEL: I wonder what will
happen to us, to people like you and me...

145
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:54,259
...when there are finally
no more wars to occupy us?

146
00:18:57,804 --> 00:18:59,430
WINTER:
Have all your men collect the weapons.

147
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:03,268
Deposit them at the church,
the school and at the airfield.

148
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:05,144
Very well.

149
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:16,239
Please accept this as my
formal surrender, major.

150
00:19:16,406 --> 00:19:20,118
It is better than to lay it
on the desk of a clerk.

151
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,461
You may keep your sidearm, colonel.

152
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,436
NARRATOR: <i>Heroic dead of a
combined Army and Marine force...</i>

153
00:19:46,602 --> 00:19:48,646
<i>...mark the grim battlefield
of Okinawa...</i>

154
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,816
<i>...where one of the bloodiest engagements
of the war is being fought.</i>

155
00:19:52,025 --> 00:19:54,986
<i>Thousands of Yanks have been wounded and
thousands have sacrificed their lives...</i>

156
00:19:55,153 --> 00:19:56,612
NIXON: Hey, Sharpe.

157
00:19:56,779 --> 00:20:00,074
<i>...to drive a fanatical foe
from this vital base.</i>

158
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:03,786
<i>Along the Jap's southern defense line,
the Yanks progress slowly...</i>

159
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:06,956
<i>...facing one of the fiercest
artillery barrages of the war.</i>

160
00:20:07,123 --> 00:20:12,170
<i>Each small advance is gained by sheer grit
in the face of withering fire...</i>

161
00:20:12,337 --> 00:20:16,382
<i>...from a suicidal enemy being
slowly hammered back into the hills.</i>

162
00:20:16,549 --> 00:20:18,885
<i>The going is brutal
and our casualties are high...</i>

163
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:22,764
<i>...but Okinawa is the next
big step towards victory over Japan.</i>

164
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:29,354
<i>A victory that can only be won by
work, war bonds and heroic sacrifice.</i>

165
00:20:36,361 --> 00:20:39,864
- So when are we going?
- We don't have a date yet.

166
00:20:40,031 --> 00:20:42,408
Are we to tell the men right away?

167
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,911
Some of them will have enough
points to go home instead.

168
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:48,873
Not many, if their only
medal's a Purple Heart.

169
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:52,293
I think most of us here
will have enough.

170
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,962
And each of us will have to decide
what to do.

171
00:20:55,129 --> 00:20:57,632
I don't know how long we're waiting
here for orders...

172
00:20:57,799 --> 00:21:03,012
...but I want those veterans who are staying,
and all new replacements, ready to fight.

173
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:06,557
That means rifle ranges.
That means daily close-order drills.

174
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:09,602
That means troop reviews.
But above all, it means physical training.

175
00:21:09,769 --> 00:21:12,271
Get your NCOs on it.

176
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:15,400
They're gonna love you.

177
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:22,198
LIEBGOTT:
What are you crouching down for, Perco?

178
00:21:22,365 --> 00:21:25,993
- Think the deer's gonna shoot back?
- Leave me alone.

179
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:30,790
How about y'all just shut up.
Let Shifty kill us some dinner.

180
00:21:30,957 --> 00:21:35,294
What's the matter, Bull? You tired of
eating dried-up spuds three times a day?

181
00:21:35,461 --> 00:21:39,006
Hey, you know what, I got an idea.
Why don't we just shoot Bull here...

182
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:40,967
...and feed the company for a week?

183
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:11,247
Oh, goddamn it, Shifty.

184
00:22:11,414 --> 00:22:15,626
You let him get away. Army ought
to be glad to be rid of you.

185
00:22:15,793 --> 00:22:19,213
I wish, you know. Seems they want me
to stay around a while.

186
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,757
- You serious?
- How many points you need?

187
00:22:21,924 --> 00:22:23,468
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen?

188
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:27,263
Jesus Christ, I thought I had it bad.

189
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,932
No Purple Hearts, never was injured.

190
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:32,351
- SPEIRS: Company!
- ALL: Platoon!

191
00:22:32,518 --> 00:22:34,896
SPEIRS: Attention!

192
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:40,318
Right shoulder...

193
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:42,195
...arms!

194
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,324
Order...

195
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:48,284
...arms!

196
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:53,122
At ease.

197
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:59,504
Gen. Taylor is aware that many veterans,
including Normandy veterans...

198
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:03,257
...still do not have the 85 points
required to be discharged.

199
00:23:03,424 --> 00:23:07,512
On this, the anniversary of D-Day,
he has authorized a lottery...

200
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:11,974
...to send one man home in each
company, effective immediately.

201
00:23:12,141 --> 00:23:15,770
For Easy Company, the winner is...

202
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:23,778
Come on, come on, come on.

203
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:29,700
...serial number 13066266.

204
00:23:30,368 --> 00:23:35,081
- Sgt. Darrell C. Powers.
- Shifty.

205
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,209
That's how it's done, Shifty.

206
00:23:40,378 --> 00:23:42,421
Congratulations, Shifty.

207
00:23:42,588 --> 00:23:46,676
Sgt. Grant will see to it that 2nd Platoon
takes over at the crossroads checkpoint...

208
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:49,220
...beginning tonight at 2200 hours.

209
00:23:49,387 --> 00:23:52,014
- So much for our anniversary.
- No shit.

210
00:23:52,181 --> 00:23:56,143
Gen. Taylor has also announced
that the 101st Airborne Division...

211
00:23:56,310 --> 00:24:00,690
...will definitely be redeployed
to the Pacific.

212
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:07,405
So beginning tomorrow at 0600 hours,
we will begin training to go to war.

213
00:24:15,329 --> 00:24:16,872
Come in.

214
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:30,136
I don't mean to interrupt you, sir.
I just wanted to say goodbye.

215
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,097
You know, you was...

216
00:24:35,141 --> 00:24:37,143
You was...

217
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:42,690
Well, it's been a long time.

218
00:24:45,026 --> 00:24:48,779
- WINTERS: You got everything you need?
- POWERS: Yes, sir. I gathered up my loot.

219
00:24:49,196 --> 00:24:52,575
Pistols, mainly. Paperwork's all done.

220
00:24:52,742 --> 00:24:55,661
I even got my back pay in my pocket.

221
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,461
Back home in Virginia...

222
00:25:06,255 --> 00:25:07,798
Well...

223
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:15,264
I just don't rightly know
how I'm gonna explain all this.

224
00:25:19,143 --> 00:25:21,103
You see, I...

225
00:25:22,021 --> 00:25:25,650
I seen... I seen...

226
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:30,363
You're a hell of a fine soldier,
Shifty.

227
00:25:30,655 --> 00:25:33,449
There's nothing more to explain.

228
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:38,496
Thank you, sir.

229
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:48,923
WINTERS: <i>Two days later,
Shifty Powers was on a truck...</i>

230
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,509
<i>...headed for the rear and a boat home.</i>

231
00:25:51,676 --> 00:25:56,472
<i>Unfortunately, the truck was hit head-on by
a drunken corporal from another regiment.</i>

232
00:25:56,639 --> 00:26:01,060
<i>Shifty had a broken pelvis,
a broken arm and a bad concussion.</i>

233
00:26:01,227 --> 00:26:05,147
<i>He survived, but had to spend the
next few months in a series of hospitals.</i>

234
00:26:05,314 --> 00:26:09,026
<i>I wish I could say that he was
our only casualty in Austria.</i>

235
00:26:09,193 --> 00:26:13,280
I've made up my mind, Nix.
I got the points, I'm going back to Kitty.

236
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:17,827
Harry, do you really think that Kitty
hasn't run off with some 4-F by now?

237
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:21,414
Son of a bitch. That's not even funny.

238
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,249
WINTERS: Harry, ignore him.

239
00:26:23,499 --> 00:26:26,836
How am I supposed to tell her I had
the chance to come home to her finally...

240
00:26:27,002 --> 00:26:29,255
...decided not to
so I could go jump on Tokyo?

241
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:32,425
All right, so don't tell her.

242
00:26:33,050 --> 00:26:35,803
Besides, she's waited for you
for three years, right?

243
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:38,889
We'll be back to Tokyo and back
in two years, three tops.

244
00:26:39,056 --> 00:26:41,892
It'll probably be over
before you even get there.

245
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,812
Reality is, you're gonna sit here in
Austria for six months, waiting to go...

246
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:47,440
...and I'm gonna be back
in Wilkes-Barre making babies.

247
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:50,526
- You didn't tell him?
- No, I couldn't get him to shut up.

248
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:54,488
What? Tell me what?

249
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:58,576
- Guts and Glory here applied for a transfer.
- What?

250
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:03,330
13th Airborne are heading out
for the Pacific right away.

251
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:09,378
If I'm going,
I wanna get it over with.

252
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:13,758
- Are you in on this too?
- I can't let him go by himself.

253
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:15,926
He doesn't know where it is.

254
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:21,474
You're leaving the men?

255
00:27:23,225 --> 00:27:25,770
They don't need me anymore.

256
00:27:36,238 --> 00:27:37,823
Wounded in Normandy?

257
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:42,119
Yes, sir. In the leg.
It was a minor flesh wound.

258
00:27:42,286 --> 00:27:46,248
- Company E lost 24 men killed there.
- Yes, sir.

259
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:51,337
Seventeen of those were in my company
commander's plane. It went down on D-Day.

260
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:55,216
So you were given command
of the company on D-Day?

261
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,051
That's right.

262
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,188
Fall back to your original positions!

263
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:13,818
Everyone else maintain
your pace of fire!

264
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:27,581
In Holland, they bumped you
to Battalion XO.

265
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:30,084
Yes, sir.

266
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:37,424
Bastards took your company away.

267
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:07,621
I fired my last shots there.

268
00:29:08,873 --> 00:29:11,125
For the whole damn war?

269
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,294
Yes, sir.

270
00:29:15,296 --> 00:29:18,924
You got through Bastogne
without having to fire your weapon?

271
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,551
That is correct, sir.

272
00:29:20,718 --> 00:29:24,930
- And you were on the line the whole time?
- Yes, sir.

273
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:30,644
Can't imagine a tougher test
for a leader.

274
00:29:30,811 --> 00:29:35,524
Having to sit through a siege
like that, under those conditions.

275
00:29:35,691 --> 00:29:36,859
We got through it.

276
00:29:37,026 --> 00:29:38,569
WINTERS:
Come on! Find some cover!

277
00:29:38,736 --> 00:29:42,907
Find some cover! Find a foxhole!
Come on, take cover!

278
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:46,118
Take cover!

279
00:29:50,748 --> 00:29:53,417
Come on, find some cover!

280
00:29:56,545 --> 00:30:00,257
- CHAPMAN: So why do you want a transfer?
- Sorry, sir?

281
00:30:00,758 --> 00:30:03,260
I said,
why do you want to leave your men?

282
00:30:03,427 --> 00:30:06,972
It's not that, sir. It's just that
if the war was still on in the Pacific...

283
00:30:07,139 --> 00:30:09,183
...and I could do some good
over there...

284
00:30:09,350 --> 00:30:12,478
Looking to have your own division
some day?

285
00:30:12,645 --> 00:30:13,938
No, sir.

286
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:17,274
- Not gonna make a career of the Army?
- No.

287
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:20,736
Ye... Well, I don't know, sir.

288
00:30:21,737 --> 00:30:27,242
Because if you think you need more combat
experience to get stars on your helmet...

289
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:30,412
...let me tell you something, son:

290
00:30:30,579 --> 00:30:32,873
You've done enough.

291
00:30:35,042 --> 00:30:37,962
Thank you, sir.
That's not my objective.

292
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:49,765
Major, I took this meeting out of respect
for your achievements.

293
00:30:49,932 --> 00:30:51,892
And for the 101st.

294
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:56,480
If they do go
to the Pacific eventually...

295
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:59,817
...you should be running
one of the battalions.

296
00:31:01,110 --> 00:31:02,861
Thank you, sir.

297
00:31:04,947 --> 00:31:08,784
And frankly, I think your men have
earned the right to keep you around.

298
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:16,667
Yes, sir.

299
00:31:17,543 --> 00:31:19,253
Thank you, sir.

300
00:31:24,258 --> 00:31:28,679
WINTERS: <i>So I would stay in Austria for
the time being, waiting for orders...</i>

301
00:31:28,846 --> 00:31:32,933
<i>...and trying to watch over soldiers
who had no enemy to fight.</i>

302
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:37,563
- WEBSTER: Lieb, I fucking hate this.
- LIEBGOTT: Jesus Christ. They fingered him.

303
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:40,983
He was in the fucking room, Webb. One of
those Polacks who was at the slave camps...

304
00:31:41,150 --> 00:31:42,526
...said this is where the guy lives.
Right here.

305
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:44,862
- Which camp?
- Whatever camp.

306
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:50,034
I'm under direct orders
and I'm happy to follow it.

307
00:32:09,178 --> 00:32:11,764
- WEBSTER: Is this a personal thing, Joe?
- LIEBGOTT: What?

308
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:15,851
- Is this personal to you?
- No, it's a goddamn order.

309
00:32:16,018 --> 00:32:19,354
- Does Maj. Winters know about this?
- Doesn't matter here.

310
00:32:19,521 --> 00:32:22,649
The fuck it doesn't.
What if this guy's just a soldier?

311
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:25,903
What if he's an officer with no ties to
the SS? What if he's innocent?

312
00:32:26,070 --> 00:32:28,822
You know what? What if he's a fucking
Nazi commandant of a fucking slave camp?

313
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:31,617
Which one? Which camp?
You don't have any proof.

314
00:32:31,784 --> 00:32:33,952
Were you at Landsberg?

315
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:35,662
You know I was.

316
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:42,002
You think he's a soldier like you and me?
A fucking innocent German officer?

317
00:32:42,169 --> 00:32:45,506
Where the hell you been
for the past three years?

318
00:32:52,096 --> 00:32:53,514
LIEBGOTT: What?

319
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:56,308
Shut up.

320
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:16,829
Don't fucking lie to me.

321
00:33:17,579 --> 00:33:21,083
See what you did to my fucking people!

322
00:33:21,375 --> 00:33:23,001
That's it.

323
00:33:49,695 --> 00:33:51,321
He's guilty.

324
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:57,619
- Liebgott says so.
- He probably is.

325
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,129
Goddamn son of a bitch.

326
00:34:07,296 --> 00:34:08,881
Shoot him.

327
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:11,967
- Shoot him!
- No.

328
00:34:35,282 --> 00:34:40,871
- Officers don't run.
- The war's over. Anybody would run.

329
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:46,710
WINTERS: <i>Summer in this Alpine paradise
should've been a welcome relief.</i>

330
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:49,796
<i>Especially now that we were at peace
with the Germans.</i>

331
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:51,798
<i>Everyone just wanted to go home.</i>

332
00:34:51,965 --> 00:34:55,260
- France. France was the best.
- Really?

333
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,012
Yeah.

334
00:34:57,179 --> 00:35:03,310
Five years. I think I was in every
country, but France was the best.

335
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:12,152
Italy would be second for me.
Russia is not desirable.

336
00:35:12,319 --> 00:35:15,072
Ukraine, it was okay.

337
00:35:15,948 --> 00:35:18,492
So when do you get out?

338
00:35:18,659 --> 00:35:23,330
The unit is discharged. We leave
when my captain gets transferred.

339
00:35:23,497 --> 00:35:26,917
- It is the end of my second war.
- Jesus!

340
00:35:27,084 --> 00:35:30,712
- I'm going home now, to Mannheim.
- I'll take this one.

341
00:35:35,717 --> 00:35:37,177
Okay.

342
00:35:42,182 --> 00:35:44,393
Hey, Webster. My relief.

343
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:49,147
- Don't salute the Germans.
- Come on. I sort of get a kick out of it.

344
00:35:49,314 --> 00:35:52,651
Anyway, I got me a new enemy.
The Japs.

345
00:35:52,818 --> 00:35:57,239
Seventy-five points. How about you?
I mean, you're a Toccoa guy, right?

346
00:35:57,406 --> 00:36:00,492
- How many you got?
- Wouldn't you like to know?

347
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:05,747
Discharged, huh?

348
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:11,211
- Go ahead, take off. It's my turn.
- Okay. See you back at the farm.

349
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:16,049
- WEBSTER: Eighty-one.
- JANOVEC: Huh?

350
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,552
I have 81 points.

351
00:36:19,761 --> 00:36:22,264
Well, that's just not good enough.

352
00:36:28,562 --> 00:36:31,231
See about getting you a ride.

353
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,943
Hey. Hey. Where are they going?

354
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:37,529
Munich. Munchen, Munich.

355
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:40,198
Wanna go to Munich?

356
00:36:51,752 --> 00:36:53,086
Get in.

357
00:36:54,796 --> 00:36:55,964
Too bad.

358
00:37:01,720 --> 00:37:03,263
JANOVEC: Turn the wheel!

359
00:37:06,183 --> 00:37:08,352
Oh, Jesus.

360
00:37:21,406 --> 00:37:23,492
MEDIC: It's Pvt. Janovec.

361
00:37:26,578 --> 00:37:29,206
He was dead when they brought him in.

362
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,961
Seventy-five points.

363
00:37:35,337 --> 00:37:38,215
- What?
- He was 10 points short.

364
00:37:40,133 --> 00:37:44,763
WINTERS: <i>The enemy had surrendered,
but somehow men were still dying.</i>

365
00:37:44,930 --> 00:37:47,432
<i>Young men who wanted to be home
with their families by now...</i>

366
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,810
<i>...who'd served with distinction
since before Normandy...</i>

367
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:53,063
<i>...were stuck here
because they didn't have the points.</i>

368
00:37:53,230 --> 00:37:59,528
<i>What they did have plenty of were weapons,
alcohol and too much time on their hands.</i>

369
00:38:00,153 --> 00:38:04,866
GRANT: All of a sudden, from out of
nowhere, a guy jumps out of the hedgerow...

370
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:10,288
...shoves a trench knife up against his
throat and screams, "Whose side are you on?"

371
00:38:11,123 --> 00:38:12,416
I don't get it.

372
00:38:12,582 --> 00:38:15,961
GRANT: It's D-Day.
It's 2nd Platoon's own Bill Guarnere.

373
00:38:16,128 --> 00:38:18,839
Old Gonorrhea himself.
Just landed in Normandy...

374
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:20,549
...and wound up
like I don't know what.

375
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:23,051
"Whose side are you on?"
What a fucking character.

376
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:25,178
TROOPER: What happened to him?

377
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:29,015
Got his leg blown off in Bastogne.

378
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,184
Wait here.

379
00:38:37,149 --> 00:38:39,860
You okay, Mac?
You need some help?

380
00:38:46,241 --> 00:38:49,244
They wouldn't give me any gas.

381
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:51,163
Krauts.

382
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,503
I tried to explain.

383
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:03,842
This fucking limey wouldn't listen.

384
00:39:04,885 --> 00:39:07,262
I think he was a major.

385
00:39:07,429 --> 00:39:11,475
- Look, private, we got a problem here.
- Do you have any gas?

386
00:39:12,184 --> 00:39:14,603
Why don't you give me your weapon?

387
00:39:15,395 --> 00:39:20,650
Well, I guess I'll just use his jeep.
I don't think he's gonna need it.

388
00:39:20,817 --> 00:39:22,944
Hold on a second, all right?

389
00:39:24,404 --> 00:39:25,864
Jesus!

390
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:28,950
Sarge! Sgt. Grant!

391
00:39:31,745 --> 00:39:33,330
Sarge!

392
00:39:40,754 --> 00:39:43,840
- Jesus.
- What?

393
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:46,051
He's not gonna make it.

394
00:39:46,218 --> 00:39:49,429
- You can't operate on him?
- Not me. You'd need a brain surgeon.

395
00:39:49,596 --> 00:39:53,475
And even if you had one,
I don't think there's any hope.

396
00:39:56,811 --> 00:39:58,605
You find the shooter, I want him alive.
Come on, help me.

397
00:39:58,772 --> 00:40:02,025
- ROE: What are you doing?
- We're gonna go find a brain surgeon.

398
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:07,822
Hey, Lieb. He wants a noncom
guarding each roadblock...

399
00:40:07,989 --> 00:40:09,991
...and at least two men
watching every road out of town.

400
00:40:10,158 --> 00:40:12,786
Bull, Malark, you each take a squad
and one of these witnesses...

401
00:40:12,953 --> 00:40:14,079
...on a house to house search.

402
00:40:14,246 --> 00:40:18,416
- Can we shoot this bastard on sight?
- Try and take him alive.

403
00:40:18,583 --> 00:40:20,001
RANDLEMAN: Where's Grant now?

404
00:40:20,168 --> 00:40:24,214
They took him to a Kraut hospital to see
if they could drum up any good doctors.

405
00:40:33,306 --> 00:40:34,891
Open up.

406
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:40,855
Come with me.

407
00:40:41,022 --> 00:40:43,275
- Why?
- Get in the jeep.

408
00:40:46,403 --> 00:40:49,781
- Where are we going?
- To the hospital. Get in.

409
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:54,828
If you're going to shoot me, shoot me.
If you're not, put the gun away.

410
00:40:54,995 --> 00:40:56,746
Get in the jeep, now.

411
00:40:57,664 --> 00:41:00,875
- What happened to him?
- He was shot in the head.

412
00:41:01,876 --> 00:41:03,712
Half-hour ago.

413
00:41:04,796 --> 00:41:08,049
- Come on.
- If you want him to live, you'll help me.

414
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:11,303
First, by putting that away.

415
00:41:13,221 --> 00:41:15,432
- Let's go.
- Let me drive.

416
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:18,184
We'll get there faster.

417
00:41:26,067 --> 00:41:29,154
LUZ:
All right, see what we got here.

418
00:41:30,363 --> 00:41:33,783
Jesus. Again, what a hand.

419
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:38,955
I don't know who's taking
a bigger beating, me or him?

420
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:41,082
Wanna play a different game?

421
00:41:41,249 --> 00:41:44,169
Same game, just shuffle
them up good, huh?

422
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:50,091
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

423
00:41:51,009 --> 00:41:53,637
Wanna go in there and join in?

424
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:57,140
I should go in there and stop this.

425
00:41:57,349 --> 00:42:00,935
Floyd, let's just play cards,
all right?

426
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,443
- Where is he?
- TALBERT: How's Grant?

427
00:42:08,610 --> 00:42:11,071
- He okay?
- Where is he?!

428
00:42:21,081 --> 00:42:22,749
This him?

429
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:25,460
That's him.

430
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:30,590
Replacement. I Company.

431
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,135
Where's the weapon?

432
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,681
What weapon?

433
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,061
When you talk to an officer,
you say "sir."

434
00:43:33,361 --> 00:43:36,990
Have the MPs take care
of this piece of shit.

435
00:43:38,324 --> 00:43:40,785
- Grant's dead?
- SPEIRS: No.

436
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:45,248
Kraut surgeon says he's gonna make it.

437
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:52,213
LIEBGOTT: Hey, tough guy, on your
feet. Come on, move.

438
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,965
TROOPER: Get up!

439
00:43:54,466 --> 00:44:00,013
I'm guessing they were Hitler's photo albums,
sir. Sure had a lot of pictures of him in it.

440
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,056
So you looked at them,
but you didn't take them?

441
00:44:02,223 --> 00:44:05,226
- That's right, sir.
- I don't believe you!

442
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:14,068
I'll be watching you.
You're dismissed.

443
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:19,657
You better not be lying to me.

444
00:44:24,996 --> 00:44:27,415
- What?
- Sir...

445
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:30,335
...if it's not gonna put you
in too much of a bind...

446
00:44:30,502 --> 00:44:34,172
...I'd like to resign as
company first sergeant.

447
00:44:35,048 --> 00:44:38,843
If I had my choice,
I miss being back amongst the men.

448
00:44:39,010 --> 00:44:43,348
I'd be happy to go to staff sergeant,
whichever platoon you wanna put me in.

449
00:44:47,644 --> 00:44:51,481
Well, I guess you've earned your right
to demote yourself.

450
00:44:51,648 --> 00:44:53,274
Thank you, sir.

451
00:44:54,526 --> 00:44:59,197
- You wanna take over Sgt. Grant's platoon?
- That would do fine, sir.

452
00:45:03,159 --> 00:45:06,830
All right then, report to It. Peacock.

453
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:11,459
Let me know if he gives you
any trouble.

454
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:15,922
Oh, sir, you make your decision yet?

455
00:45:16,172 --> 00:45:17,715
Yeah, I did.

456
00:45:25,682 --> 00:45:28,434
WINTERS:
So, what else is on your mind?

457
00:45:28,977 --> 00:45:32,564
I know Easy Company is gonna need
a commanding officer postwar.

458
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:36,192
Somebody to hold their hand,
keep them from killing each other.

459
00:45:36,359 --> 00:45:39,362
It better be somebody who knows
what they're doing.

460
00:45:39,529 --> 00:45:41,030
WINTERS:
Yup. I couldn't agree more.

461
00:45:41,197 --> 00:45:45,159
It's absolutely irresponsible to leave them
in the hands of the wrong person.

462
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:49,038
They're too much of a valuable
resource to the military.

463
00:45:52,709 --> 00:45:55,086
So you've decided to stay in the Army?

464
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:57,714
Yes, I'm gonna stay with the men.

465
00:45:59,549 --> 00:46:01,759
Well, I'm glad to hear it.

466
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:07,348
WINTERS:
<i>So some of us would stay by choice.</i>

467
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:11,561
<i>But others were stuck here, unless we
could find excuses to send them away.</i>

468
00:46:11,728 --> 00:46:13,354
So it's an airborne exhibition.

469
00:46:13,521 --> 00:46:16,941
They have one of every Allied combat
plane they've used in the war.

470
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:18,443
Uh-huh.

471
00:46:18,735 --> 00:46:20,028
I mean, yes, sir.

472
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:23,907
You'll be like a technical adviser,
make sure they get everything right.

473
00:46:24,073 --> 00:46:28,077
- I understand, sir.
- Sorry it's not a more hospitable location.

474
00:46:28,244 --> 00:46:33,374
No, sir, Paris is just fine, if you need me
to go. Someone has to be there.

475
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:35,627
We do. We absolutely do.

476
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:40,089
Your driver will drop you off
at a hotel of your choice...

477
00:46:40,256 --> 00:46:44,636
...and I don't think we'll see you
back here anytime soon.

478
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:47,055
I won't let you down, sir.

479
00:47:00,985 --> 00:47:03,363
Carwood, yes...

480
00:47:03,529 --> 00:47:07,533
I wanted to say,
as you probably know...

481
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,827
...the Army, when they give a man
a battlefield commission...

482
00:47:09,994 --> 00:47:13,581
...make him an officer, they usually
don't let him stay with the same company.

483
00:47:13,748 --> 00:47:16,376
Yes, sir. I figured this was coming.

484
00:47:16,626 --> 00:47:18,878
Yeah. They're afraid the men
won't show him...

485
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:21,464
...the proper degree of respect
as they would another officer.

486
00:47:21,631 --> 00:47:23,716
Yeah. It's a good theory, sir.

487
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:26,761
It's an idiotic theory.
Especially in your case.

488
00:47:26,928 --> 00:47:31,224
Nevertheless, they've given me
the choice as to where to reassign you.

489
00:47:31,391 --> 00:47:35,103
And I thought Battalion Headquarters
might be a good place.

490
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:37,855
I can think of few better, sir.

491
00:47:38,022 --> 00:47:40,400
Good. Good.

492
00:47:41,317 --> 00:47:45,655
Right now, down at the airfield
there is a German general...

493
00:47:45,822 --> 00:47:47,824
...who is a little PO'd
about having to surrender...

494
00:47:47,991 --> 00:47:50,159
...to Pvt. Babe Heffron
from South Philly.

495
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:53,204
- Thinks it's beneath his stature.
- Understandable, sir.

496
00:47:53,621 --> 00:47:57,959
Yeah. I thought 2nd It. Carwood Lipton
from West Virginia...

497
00:47:58,126 --> 00:48:02,130
- ...could soothe his ruffled feathers.
- No problem, sir.

498
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:06,300
Major, is this the type of job
I can expect from now on?

499
00:48:08,428 --> 00:48:12,682
Yeah. Yeah. When we're not
sunning ourselves by the lake.

500
00:48:23,317 --> 00:48:24,736
Lieutenant.

501
00:48:33,953 --> 00:48:37,290
With your permission,
I would like to address my men briefly.

502
00:48:37,457 --> 00:48:40,001
That'll be fine, general.

503
00:48:49,761 --> 00:48:51,971
- Capt. Sobel.
- Maj. Winters.

504
00:48:52,138 --> 00:48:53,264
Capt. Sobel.

505
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:58,478
We salute the rank, not the man.

506
00:49:22,752 --> 00:49:24,128
WINTERS: Liebgott?

507
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:29,509
Men, it's been a long war,
it's been a tough war.

508
00:49:33,012 --> 00:49:37,934
You have fought bravely,
proudly, for your country.

509
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,648
You are a special group...

510
00:49:46,818 --> 00:49:49,362
...who found in one another
a bond...

511
00:49:54,784 --> 00:49:57,036
...that exists only in combat...

512
00:49:58,871 --> 00:50:00,748
...among brothers...

513
00:50:02,625 --> 00:50:04,627
...of shared foxholes.

514
00:50:09,841 --> 00:50:12,426
Held each other in dire moments.

515
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:23,396
Have seen death
and suffered together.

516
00:50:30,778 --> 00:50:34,991
I am proud to have served
with each and every one of you.

517
00:50:40,413 --> 00:50:44,458
You deserve long and happy lives
in peace.

518
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:01,559
Towel, towel, towel!

519
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:04,187
Thanks.

520
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:06,731
Take a look at these two kids.

521
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:10,568
What the hell happened to them?

522
00:51:11,360 --> 00:51:13,446
New Jersey, huh?

523
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:16,532
Yeah.

524
00:51:17,158 --> 00:51:18,576
Think about it.

525
00:51:19,327 --> 00:51:20,995
Yeah, I am.

526
00:51:22,997 --> 00:51:24,874
You awake yet?

527
00:51:26,167 --> 00:51:27,627
Awake?

528
00:51:29,086 --> 00:51:30,922
Time to go to bed.

529
00:51:45,770 --> 00:51:47,438
TROOPER 1: Come on, Jimmy.

530
00:51:49,398 --> 00:51:51,776
- TROOPER 2: Nice play.
- TROOPER 3: We got one down.

531
00:51:51,943 --> 00:51:53,653
TROOPER 2: Come on, Pee Wee.
Let's get Webster.

532
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:56,697
TROOPER 1: Come on, Pee Wee,
let's get him here, baby.

533
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:01,827
WINTERS: <i>Buck Compton came back to see the
company to let us know he was all right.</i>

534
00:52:01,994 --> 00:52:04,622
<i>He became a prosecutor in Los Angeles.</i>

535
00:52:04,789 --> 00:52:07,833
<i>He convicted Sirhan Sirhan
in the murder of Robert Kennedy...</i>

536
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,296
<i>...and was later appointed
to the California Court of Appeals.</i>

537
00:52:12,964 --> 00:52:15,508
<i>David Webster became a writer
for The Saturday Evening Post...</i>

538
00:52:15,675 --> 00:52:19,887
<i>...and Wall Street Journal,
and later wrote a book about sharks.</i>

539
00:52:20,054 --> 00:52:26,727
<i>In 1961, he went out on the ocean alone,
and was never seen again.</i>

540
00:52:29,772 --> 00:52:31,649
TROOPER 1: Go, go, go! Yeah!

541
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:35,486
WINTERS: <i>Johnny Martin would return
to his job at the railroad...</i>

542
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:38,197
<i>...and then start
his own construction company.</i>

543
00:52:38,364 --> 00:52:42,576
<i>He splits his time between Arizona
and a place in Montana.</i>

544
00:52:44,954 --> 00:52:49,417
<i>George Luz became a handyman
in Providence, RI.</i>

545
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:53,045
<i>And as a testament to his character...</i>

546
00:52:53,254 --> 00:52:57,425
<i>...1600 people attended
his funeral in 1998.</i>

547
00:52:58,259 --> 00:53:03,180
<i>Doc Roe died in Louisiana in 1998.</i>

548
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:06,475
<i>He'd been a construction contractor.</i>

00:53:08,644 --> 00:53:13,691
<i>Frank Perconte returned to Chicago and
worked a postal route as a mailman.</i>

550
00:53:20,323 --> 00:53:25,119
<i>Joe Liebgott returned to San Francisco
and drove his cab.</i>

551
00:53:27,038 --> 00:53:31,000
<i>Bull Randleman was one
of the best soldiers I ever had.</i>

552
00:53:31,167 --> 00:53:36,756
<i>He went into the earth-moving business
in Arkansas. He's still there.</i>

553
00:53:43,596 --> 00:53:47,391
<i>Alton More returned to Wyoming
with a unique souvenir:</i>

554
00:53:47,558 --> 00:53:50,519
<i>Hitler's personal photo albums.</i>

555
00:53:50,686 --> 00:53:54,690
<i>He was killed in a car accident
in 1958.</i>

556
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:59,070
<i>Floyd Talbert we all
lost touch with in civilian life...</i>

557
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:04,283
<i>...until he showed up at a reunion
just before his death in 1981.</i>

558
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:11,332
<i>How we lived our lives after the war
was as varied as each man.</i>

559
00:54:11,999 --> 00:54:14,335
<i>Carwood Lipton became
a glass making executive...</i>

560
00:54:14,502 --> 00:54:16,879
<i>...in charge of factories
all over the world.</i>

561
00:54:17,046 --> 00:54:20,049
<i>He has a nice life in North Carolina.</i>

562
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:22,843
<i>Harry Welsh, he married Kitty Grogan.</i>

567
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:49,453
- WINTERS: Get them round.
- TROOPER 3: All right, Webster.

568
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:52,373
Easy Company. School circle!

569
00:54:58,838 --> 00:55:02,633
WINTERS: <i>For Easy Company,
it was D-Day plus 434.</i>

570
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:05,886
A fast man would've had it, Perco.

571
00:55:06,053 --> 00:55:08,556
Listen up. Got some news.

572
00:55:10,099 --> 00:55:15,688
This morning, President Truman received the
unconditional surrender from the Japanese.

573
00:55:16,272 --> 00:55:17,940
War's over.

574
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:22,570
<i>Regardless of points, medals
or wounds...</i>

575
00:55:22,778 --> 00:55:26,449
<i>...each man in the 101st Airborne
would be going home.</i>

576
00:55:27,491 --> 00:55:31,954
<i>Each of us would be forever connected
by our shared experience.</i>

577
00:55:32,455 --> 00:55:36,542
<i>And each would have to rejoin
the world as best he could.</i>

578
00:55:51,932 --> 00:55:54,768
<i>Lewis Nixon had some tough times
after the war.</i>

579
00:55:54,935 --> 00:55:57,188
<i>He was divorced a couple of times.</i>

580
00:55:57,354 --> 00:56:02,026
<i>Then in 1956 he married a woman named
Grace and everything came together for him.</i>

581
00:56:02,193 --> 00:56:05,404
<i>He spent the rest of his life with her,
traveling the world.</i>

582
00:56:05,571 --> 00:56:09,700
<i>My friend Lew died in 1995.</i>

583
00:56:10,409 --> 00:56:14,914
<i>I took up his job offer and was a personnel
manager at the Nixon Nitration Works...</i>

584
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:19,251
<i>...until I was called back into service
in 1950 to train officers and rangers.</i>

585
00:56:19,418 --> 00:56:23,672
<i>I chose not to go to Korea.
I'd had enough of war.</i>

586
00:56:23,839 --> 00:56:28,177
<i>I stayed around Hershey, PA,
finally finding a little farm...</i>

587
00:56:28,344 --> 00:56:32,932
<i>...a little peaceful corner of the world,
where I still live today.</i>

588
00:56:33,098 --> 00:56:38,521
<i>And there's not a day that goes by that
I do not think of the men I served with...</i>

589
00:56:38,687 --> 00:56:42,441
<i>...who never got to enjoy the world
without war.</i>

590
00:56:42,608 --> 00:56:47,279
It's a very unusual feeling.

591
00:56:47,446 --> 00:56:51,992
It's a very unusual happening
and it's a very unusual bonding.

592
00:56:52,159 --> 00:56:54,203
We knew that we could depend
on each other.

593
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:58,207
And so we were a close-knit group.

594
00:56:58,374 --> 00:57:01,669
Just brave.
So brave, it was unbelievable.

595
00:57:01,835 --> 00:57:04,964
And I don't know anybody
that I admire more...

596
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:09,051
...than Bill Guarnere and Joe Toye.

597
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:12,054
They were very special.

598
00:57:12,221 --> 00:57:15,891
I'm just one part of the big war.
That's all. One little part.

599
00:57:17,268 --> 00:57:22,523
And I'm proud to be a part of it.
Sometimes it makes me cry.

600
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:24,984
The real men, the real heroes...

601
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:30,364
...are the fellows that are still buried over
there and those that come home to be buried.

602
00:57:30,739 --> 00:57:34,535
Seemed like you thought
that you could do just about anything.

603
00:57:34,702 --> 00:57:37,371
And after the war was over
and you came back out...

604
00:57:37,538 --> 00:57:42,376
...you lost a lot of that. Or at least
I did. I lost all that confidence.

605
00:57:42,543 --> 00:57:46,046
You was hoping to stay alive.
That's all.

606
00:57:48,215 --> 00:57:51,969
Henry V was talking to his men.

607
00:57:52,136 --> 00:57:54,555
He said, "From this day...

608
00:57:54,722 --> 00:57:57,600
...to the ending of the world...

609
00:57:57,766 --> 00:58:01,186
...we in it shall be remembered.

610
00:58:01,353 --> 00:58:05,482
We lucky few, we band of brothers.

611
00:58:05,649 --> 00:58:09,653
For he who today
sheds his blood with me...

612
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,488
...shall be my brother."

613
00:58:13,032 --> 00:58:15,034
Do you remember...

614
00:58:17,119 --> 00:58:20,581
...the letter that Mike Ranney wrote me?

615
00:58:20,748 --> 00:58:21,874
You do?

616
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:24,960
Do you remember how he ended it?

617
00:58:26,337 --> 00:58:29,673
"I cherish the memories...

618
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:34,094
...of a question my grandson
asked me the other day...

619
00:58:34,261 --> 00:58:39,683
...when he said, 'Grandpa,
were you a hero in the war?'

620
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:45,022
Grandpa said, 'No...

621
00:58:48,984 --> 00:58:52,655
...but I served in a company
of heroes.'"
