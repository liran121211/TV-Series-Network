1
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:36,363
I never thought I'd get through D-Day,
let alone the next phase or the next phase.

2
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:38,740
I thought I was gonna
get killed instantly.

3
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:42,744
I thought one of two things:
a quick death...

4
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:46,081
...or I'd come through
probably without a scratch.

5
00:02:46,249 --> 00:02:52,421
I think everybody had fear. I think
there's people that can handle fear.

6
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:56,216
I think I was probably one of them.

7
00:02:56,384 --> 00:03:01,513
I think I was just as scared
as anybody else, except I could think.

8
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:06,226
It's a feeling you would
not let yourself down...

9
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:10,898
...and you would not let your comrades
or your unit down.

10
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:17,196
We all had fear,
but we all had training to know...

11
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,615
...that you try to handle your fear...

12
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:24,870
...and work to accomplish
what you're supposed to be doing.

13
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:19,174
Hey, it looks like what's-his-name.

14
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,636
You know, from 1 st Platoon?

15
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:25,639
- Our 1 st Platoon?
- It sure does.

16
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,939
Blithe.

17
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:36,441
Hey, Blithe.

18
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,612
Blithe!

19
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:51,707
Keep moving! Get down!

20
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,214
Thought that was you.

21
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,051
You alone?

22
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:07,347
You're the first familiar faces I've seen.

23
00:05:07,515 --> 00:05:11,560
I ain't surprised. They dropped us
all over the Contentin Peninsula.

24
00:05:11,728 --> 00:05:15,397
We've been fighting with the 502nd
since we hit the ground.

25
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:17,524
You?

26
00:05:19,527 --> 00:05:21,945
Oh, I've been...

27
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:26,533
- ...trying to find Easy.
- Join the club.

28
00:05:36,794 --> 00:05:38,211
Spread out!

29
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:52,392
Hey, fellas.

30
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,772
- Well, look who decided to show up, Floyd.
- Hey, Luz.

31
00:05:56,939 --> 00:05:59,566
- Thought we'd never find you guys.
- You okay?

32
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:02,486
- Get a load of this. You like that?
- Yeah, it's the real stuff, eh?

33
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:05,322
- Yeah, of course.
- You like this?

34
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,950
- You like this?
- Oh, nice. That's a beauty, sarge.

35
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:10,827
It's a hell of a poncho.

36
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:13,872
My Luger's gonna put you all
to shame when I get it.

37
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:21,713
How was your jump?

38
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:25,759
- Missed the DZ.
- Yeah, that goes without saying.

39
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:30,097
- I guess so.
- Got any souvenirs to trade?

40
00:06:31,432 --> 00:06:36,978
They're all ticking, unlike their
previous owners. Got anything good?

41
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:38,772
Not yet.

42
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,489
So have we lost anybody?

43
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:52,119
Tommy Burgess took one in the face.
Popeye Wynn got pinked in the behind.

44
00:06:52,328 --> 00:06:55,163
- They're gonna be okay.
- That's good.

45
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:58,792
- You run into Lt. Meehan on your travels?
- No. Why?

46
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,504
Company HQ's still missing.
They think the plane went down.

47
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:06,716
- They say he's gonna turn up.
- Yeah, I ain't holding my breath.

48
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:09,344
- Who's in command now?
- Winters for now.

49
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,513
Lt. Welsh is 1 st Platoon.

50
00:07:11,681 --> 00:07:14,850
- Easy Company on the road!
- Let's go! 1 st Platoon!

51
00:07:15,476 --> 00:07:18,186
- Platoon! Move out!
- 1 st Platoon, on your feet!

52
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,521
Let's go, 1 st Platoon!

53
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:24,192
- Easy's moving out. On your feet.
- Let's go!

54
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:28,530
- Stand up, let's go! Here we go!
- Today, people!

55
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:33,368
Listen up! It'll be dark soon. I want
light and noise discipline from here on.

56
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:38,039
No talking, no smoking and no playing
grab-fanny with the man in front of you, Luz.

57
00:07:38,207 --> 00:07:41,376
- So where we headed to, lieutenant, huh?
- We're taking Carentan.

58
00:07:41,586 --> 00:07:42,752
That sounds like fun.

59
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:46,756
It's the only place where armor from Omaha
and Utah Beach can link up and head inland.

60
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,217
Until we take Carentan,
they're stuck on the sand.

61
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:52,012
General Taylor's sending
the whole division.

62
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,597
"Remember, boys...

63
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:56,683
...give me three days and three nights
of hard fighting...

64
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,060
...and you will be relieved."

65
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,063
Lieutenant. Lieutenant, I'll take point.

66
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:04,357
Cpl. Hoobler will be lead scout.

67
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,903
- Blithe, glad you could join us.
- Thank you, sir.

68
00:08:08,112 --> 00:08:10,280
1 st Platoon, fall in behind
Fox Company.

69
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:15,577
You people from 2nd and 3rd Platoons,
follow us. Shake a leg.

70
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:20,749
"Another thing to remember, boys:
flies spread disease.

71
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,919
So keep yours closed."

72
00:09:09,465 --> 00:09:12,008
Don't wake Jerry.

73
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,820
- Damn it.
- What?

74
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:35,490
- We lost F Company, sir.
- Again?

75
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:41,162
- We lost F Company.
- Again? Hey, Blithe, Skinny, guess what.

76
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:43,248
Perconte, go back
and pass the word to hold up.

77
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:44,457
Yes, sir.

78
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:49,212
- Hoobler, take Blithe. Go find F Company.
- Yes, sir. Come on, Blithe.

79
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:02,017
Shit.

80
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:07,897
Did you send somebody?

81
00:10:08,065 --> 00:10:09,357
Yeah, I got Hoobler and Blithe
out there now.

82
00:10:09,525 --> 00:10:10,859
Why are we stopped?

83
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:15,322
This is about officers crapping out
on their training, Nix.

84
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:19,200
Come on. Let's get this show
on the road.

85
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,831
Damn mosquitoes.

86
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,011
What is it?

87
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,846
Shh.

88
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:44,142
- Flash.
- Thunder.

89
00:10:47,438 --> 00:10:51,232
- I can hear y'all all the way across the field.
- You F Company?

90
00:10:52,401 --> 00:10:54,402
That's right.

91
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:58,114
Where y'all been?

92
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:02,035
Blithe, go back to the lieutenant,
tell him we found F Company.

93
00:11:02,244 --> 00:11:07,666
- I'll figure out where these yokels are at.
- Hey, who y'all calling a yokel?

94
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:21,346
He's dead, private.

95
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:26,184
- Did you find Fox Company?
- Yes, sir.

96
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:32,607
Thought he-- I thought he had me.

97
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:37,529
Paratrooper?

98
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:40,949
Division thinks there's a regiment
of them holding Carentan.

99
00:11:41,117 --> 00:11:43,702
- Well, there's one less to worry about.
- Yeah.

100
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,454
That's edelweiss.

101
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:49,874
That only grows in the Alps
above the tree line.

102
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,918
Which means he climbed
up there to get it.

103
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,588
It's supposed to be the mark
of a true soldier.

104
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:18,862
I want you to take the 1 st
straight up the middle, hard and fast.

105
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,113
We have to move quickly.

106
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:23,199
I'll be right behind you
with 2nd and 3rd.

107
00:12:36,922 --> 00:12:41,342
- Go!
- Let's go, 1 st, let's go.

108
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:44,262
Go, go! Go!

109
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,142
Fire!

110
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:56,399
- In the ditch! Down! Down!
- Get down! Incoming!

111
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,032
- Goddamn it.
- Where the fuck is everybody?

112
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:09,871
- Where'd everybody go?
- I have no idea!

113
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:14,584
Let's go, Easy!
Get those MGs moving, will you?

114
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:17,587
- Let's get them out of there!
- They're in the open, for Pete's sake!

115
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:20,215
Go! Go!

116
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:24,427
Get them going, Buck!
Follow me, Easy!

117
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,889
Move out! Move out, men!

118
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:29,182
Go!

119
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:33,895
Move out! Move out!

120
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:37,398
Get yourselves out of that ditch!

121
00:13:37,566 --> 00:13:40,902
We have men getting killed
out there, Blithe!

122
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:46,407
Move! You got no cover there! Go!

123
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,034
Go!

124
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:50,328
Spotter! Upstairs window! Left!

125
00:13:52,331 --> 00:13:53,748
Follow me!

126
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,584
Get yourselves out of those trenches!

127
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,629
In the ditch!
Down, down, down, down!

128
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:03,341
- Incoming!
- That's an MG42!

129
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:08,596
- Medic up!
- No! Stay down! He's shot!

130
00:14:08,764 --> 00:14:10,849
Get out of the dirt! Nazi!

131
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,823
There's one in the right upper--

132
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:31,119
Medic! Pull him back!

133
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:38,459
Ah, shit!

134
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:46,009
Sniper! Thattaway! Second floor left!

135
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:00,899
Ah, shit!

136
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:06,070
I need some covering fire. Ready, Luz?

137
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:11,784
Okay, I'm out.

138
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:21,878
Guarnere! Clear that sector
on the right!

139
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:24,923
Hey, up with me!

140
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:32,597
- Shit!
- Move, Luz! Here! High!

141
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,849
You okay, Shifty?

142
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:38,353
We gotta take that warehouse!

143
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:41,856
Shifty!

144
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:47,236
Hammer those windows.

145
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,366
Let's go! Move! Go! Go!

146
00:15:51,533 --> 00:15:53,618
Tipper, take Liebgott,
start clearing these buildings.

147
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,162
- Right. Come on, Joe, let's go.
- Two to a house.

148
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,958
Second two. Go! Go!

149
00:16:02,586 --> 00:16:04,629
Houses on the right!

150
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,714
Check them and clear them!

151
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,562
Turn left! Bring it up!

152
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,781
Smash it.

153
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:35,076
Grenade! Luz, come on, Luz.

154
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,746
- Come on!
- Close behind.

155
00:17:02,187 --> 00:17:03,813
Shit!

156
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,817
They got us zeroed! Spread it out!
Spread it out!

157
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,028
- They got us zeroed!
- Go now!

158
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:13,448
- Get out of the street!
- Get the hell out of there!

159
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:16,117
They got us zeroed!

160
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,329
Get out of there! Go! Go!

161
00:17:20,664 --> 00:17:23,207
Get the hell out of the street! Move!

162
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,501
Let's go! Go! Go!

163
00:17:26,503 --> 00:17:31,632
- Take cover!
- I need a hand over here!

164
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:53,029
Medic!

165
00:17:56,325 --> 00:17:58,493
- Move over!
- Through the window!

166
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:13,216
Come on. Let's get you out of here.
Come on, boy!

167
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:15,760
Come on.

168
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:18,346
Move! Move! Move!

169
00:18:18,514 --> 00:18:21,724
Get out of the street! Go! Go!

170
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:30,691
Lip!

171
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,531
Hey there, buddy.

172
00:18:45,207 --> 00:18:48,709
You're okay, Lip.
Everything's right where it should be.

173
00:18:48,877 --> 00:18:50,795
Come on. Upsy-daisy.

174
00:18:53,090 --> 00:18:54,549
Let's check up front.

175
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,717
Get Tipper up here with the bazooka.

176
00:18:56,885 --> 00:19:00,721
- Check across the front.
- Move on one!

177
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:25,746
Hello? Anybody there?

178
00:19:39,428 --> 00:19:41,804
Tipper! Tip!

179
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:46,809
Tipper! Answer me! Tip!

180
00:19:50,606 --> 00:19:53,107
- Joe? That you?
- Looking good, Tip.

181
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:57,695
Looking real good. Come here, buddy.
You gotta sit down. Come here. Come on.

182
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,698
Easy, easy. There you go.
There you go.

183
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:08,623
Ah, Jesus.

184
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:22,678
You hang in there, buddy. Okay,
we're gonna get you fixed up, all right?

185
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:27,350
Okay. Guys, you wanna give me
a hand here? Come on.

186
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:31,687
Take the left flank!
Take the left flank!

187
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,440
Got a bad one.

188
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:36,859
- Can we move him?
- No.

189
00:20:37,152 --> 00:20:39,153
Padre!

190
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:45,368
- In the name of the Father, the Son--
- Hey, Malark. You see what I'm seeing?

191
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:50,248
--Is now and forever shall be,
world without end. Amen.

192
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:54,418
- Crazy fools, the Irish.
- You should know.

193
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,843
Smokey, the window. Let's go!

194
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:29,787
- Ho. Morning, sir.
- What's your name, trooper?

195
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:32,415
Sergeant Farnsworth
from Able Company, 501 st.

196
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,125
I'm here and I'm supposed to tell you...

197
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,794
...that we got it clear from here
all the way to the north of them Krauts, sir.

198
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:40,881
Well, tell your CO 506 arrived in force
and secured all positions south of you.

199
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:43,718
Yes, sir, I'll tell him.
Come on, fat boy, let's go!

200
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,886
Lieutenant Winters.

201
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:49,265
- Yes, sir?
- Is it safe to cross now?

202
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:52,226
- What's that, sir?
- Is it safe to cross?

203
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:54,895
- We wanna move the wounded.
- Yes, sir.

204
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:56,731
Okay.

205
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:02,945
Come on. Let's get them out of here.

206
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,005
There she is.

207
00:22:21,214 --> 00:22:23,090
Plasma drip.

208
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,969
You're lucky it was a ricochet.

209
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,972
- You just caught a piece of it.
- Stupid.

210
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,474
- What?
- Nothing.

211
00:22:31,641 --> 00:22:33,934
Walking wounded to the rear.

212
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:37,938
- You gonna be able to stay off it?
- Doesn't look that way.

213
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,608
Well, you gotta try, huh?

214
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,693
What've we got planned, chief?

215
00:22:42,861 --> 00:22:45,488
Well, we expect a counterattack.

216
00:22:45,655 --> 00:22:48,032
Carentan's as important to them
as it is to us.

217
00:22:48,241 --> 00:22:51,786
- Any idea when?
- We're not waiting around to find out.

218
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:57,124
Battalion wants us to head east toward
high ground, set up a defensive position.

219
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:00,294
With all the flooded fields, it's the only
direction they can approach from.

220
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,046
Yeah.

221
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:07,134
- You gonna be all right?
- Ye-- Yeah.

222
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:10,304
Good.

223
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,187
What's wrong with Blithe?

224
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,525
Well, nothing. Except he can't see.

225
00:23:23,318 --> 00:23:26,487
- He can't see?
- So he says.

226
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:45,798
Blithe?

227
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,218
It's Lieutenant Winters.

228
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,804
What happened?

229
00:23:53,723 --> 00:23:55,683
I don't know, sir.

230
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,312
Well, things...
They just kind of went black on me.

231
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:05,901
- What, you can't see?
- Not a thing, sir.

232
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:08,946
I can't see a thing.

233
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:14,410
Well, you just take it easy, Blithe.

234
00:24:14,578 --> 00:24:17,955
I'm gonna get you out of here.
Get you back to England.

235
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,460
It's gonna be okay.

236
00:24:24,754 --> 00:24:26,422
Sir...

237
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:33,471
- ...I didn't wanna let anyone down.
- No.

238
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:37,391
Just take it easy.

239
00:24:40,228 --> 00:24:42,104
It's okay, son.

240
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,242
Sir?

241
00:24:58,246 --> 00:25:00,414
- Yeah? What is it?
- Thank you, sir.

242
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:06,462
I'm okay.

243
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:11,258
Yeah, I'm okay.

244
00:25:11,426 --> 00:25:13,677
I'm okay. I think I'm okay.

245
00:25:14,763 --> 00:25:16,305
You can see?

246
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:21,310
God, I don't know what happened.

247
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:24,772
I think-- I think I'm okay.

248
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,276
All right.

249
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:33,447
Well, stay here a little while longer
and make sure.

250
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:37,326
And then you can report
back to your platoon.

251
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,039
Yes, sir.

252
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:55,511
Now can we get that bandage on?

253
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:57,471
Yeah.

254
00:25:58,431 --> 00:26:02,810
- Berlin by Christmas, that's how I see it.
- Yeah, you're full of it.

255
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:07,982
Oh, God. This Kraut cheese
tastes like--

256
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:11,068
- It stinks.
- Bread's stale too.

257
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:13,028
- Give me that.
- Yes, sir.

258
00:26:13,196 --> 00:26:15,447
The way we came into town today
and took over?

259
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,700
You know, it don't seem like
Jerry's got too much fight left in him.

260
00:26:17,867 --> 00:26:20,911
Hey, More, don't get hit in the face when
Jerry throws in the sponge, all right?

261
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:24,415
You mark my words, Mal:
Berlin by Christmas.

262
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:27,751
Enjoy it while it lasts.
We'll be moving out soon.

263
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,213
Out of town, lieutenant? Already?

264
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:33,257
That's right.

265
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:43,017
Don't they know we're just getting
settled here?

266
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,523
Nice, Groucho.

267
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,984
- What?
- Real smart.

268
00:26:52,193 --> 00:26:55,779
You know, you're taking your life
in your own hands. Ain't that right?

269
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:58,198
I told you. I didn't actually see it.

270
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:01,285
What, Speirs shooting the prisoners,
or the sergeant in his own platoon?

271
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,037
- Sergeant?
- What? I didn't hear that one.

272
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:06,540
- Wait, wait. He shot one of his own guys?
- Well, supposedly, the guy was drunk...

273
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,375
...and refused to go on a patrol.

274
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:10,544
Who knows if it's true?

275
00:27:11,546 --> 00:27:13,547
- Well, I know a guy...
- Hey.

276
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:18,052
...who said an eyewitness told him
that Speirs hosed those prisoners.

277
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,554
Why? What for?

278
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:23,140
On D-Day.

279
00:27:23,558 --> 00:27:27,936
Speirs comes across this group of Kraut
prisoners digging a hole or some such...

280
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:30,397
<i>...under guard and all.</i>

281
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:34,234
<i>He breaks out a pack of smokes,</i>
<i>passes them out.</i>

282
00:27:34,402 --> 00:27:37,237
<i>He even gives them a light.</i>

283
00:27:39,240 --> 00:27:42,826
<i>Then, all of a sudden,</i>
<i>he swings up his Thompson and:</i>

284
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,455
He hoses them.

285
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:51,126
I mean, goddamn!

286
00:27:51,753 --> 00:27:54,546
He gives them smokes first?!

287
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,965
You see, that's why
I don't believe he really did it.

288
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,551
- Oh, you don't believe it?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, I heard he didn't do it.

289
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,104
<i>No, no, no, it was him, all right.</i>

290
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:13,607
But it was more than eight guys.
More like 20.

291
00:28:18,655 --> 00:28:20,572
Hell of a shot.

292
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:25,786
All except one guy, who he left alone.

293
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:28,288
Well, all I know, from what I heard...

294
00:28:28,456 --> 00:28:31,208
...he took that last 105 on D-Day
practically by himself.

295
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:33,877
- Running through MG fire like a maniac.
- Yeah, that I did see.

296
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,379
- On his own?
- Yep.

297
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,423
I don't care if any
of the other stuff's true.

298
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:38,716
Hey, Albert.

299
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,801
Grab your smokes,
grab your ammo and gear.

300
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:42,845
What do you think?

301
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,638
I don't know.

302
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:48,142
Gonna have to take everybody's word for it.
I didn't see any of it.

303
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:52,396
Let's go! 1 st Platoon! Weapons on me.
We're moving out.

304
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:56,692
On your feet! Tactical columns!
Flankers out!

305
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,861
Flanks up!

306
00:28:59,028 --> 00:29:03,240
- That means you, Private Blithe.
- Come on, bud. Get up.

307
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,368
You want the bread?

308
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:28,557
Hey, Luz. How far are we going?

309
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:33,854
Oh, Jesus Christ, Frank. I don't know.
Until they tell us to stop.

310
00:29:34,147 --> 00:29:37,524
High ground.
There's high ground up ahead.

311
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:40,778
Yeah. Okay, genius.
Answer me this, then:

312
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:45,574
Why is Easy Company the only company
who's either at the front of an advance...

313
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:49,286
...or, like now, exposed
at the far edge of the line?

314
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:52,372
- To keep you on your toes.
- No, that's not what I'm saying.

315
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:55,083
I'm saying that
we're never in the middle...

316
00:29:55,251 --> 00:29:58,420
...and we're the fifth of nine
companies of this regiment.

317
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:02,716
- Able through Item. Think of it.
- See there? You see that--

318
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:05,260
Incoming!

319
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:09,389
Contact right! Get in the hedgerow!

320
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,980
See what I mean?!

321
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,485
Bring it around!

322
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:27,616
Right there! Sergeant More! Stay low!

323
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:32,913
Luz, get down here with the radio!
Sergeant More! On me!

324
00:30:36,584 --> 00:30:38,919
Go, go, go!

325
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:19,668
What have they got to sing about?

326
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,463
Flash!

327
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,300
Thunder.

328
00:31:26,801 --> 00:31:29,136
Catchy tune, ain't it?

329
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:34,016
- Hey, lieutenant. What's the news?
- Same as it was this afternoon.

330
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:38,645
- They're in their hedgerow, we're in ours.
- Spell me a minute, sir?

331
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:41,356
You gonna let Blithe get some sack time?

332
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:45,152
- My back teeth are floating.
- Get back here ASAP, Martin.

333
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,487
You can count on me, sir.

334
00:31:58,666 --> 00:32:01,168
How you doing, Blithe?

335
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:03,337
I'm okay, sir.

336
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:07,007
What happened
at the aid station today?

337
00:32:08,176 --> 00:32:13,597
Doc Roe, he called it
hysterical blindness.

338
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,352
No, thank you, sir.

339
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:23,690
You know what they said in basic:
Dehydration's a soldier's worst enemy.

340
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:25,400
Here.

341
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,570
Yeah.

342
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:35,410
It's a game, Blithe. That's all. We're--

343
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:40,540
Hell, we're just moving the ball
forward one yard at a time.

344
00:32:40,708 --> 00:32:43,251
Nothing but a game.

345
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:47,047
What is, sir?

346
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:51,885
This. The whole thing.

347
00:32:53,054 --> 00:32:55,847
No. Thank you, sir.

348
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:58,475
Just a game.

349
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:00,727
Harry.

350
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:16,994
S2 said the Germans only left
a company to defend Carentan.

351
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:19,413
The rest pulled out sometime last night.

352
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:23,041
- I knew that town was too easy.
- Yeah.

353
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,754
They regrouped south of town.

354
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:32,092
May have been on the way to a
counterattack when we ran into them here.

355
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,428
Strength unknown.

356
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:39,766
They want the town back.

357
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,436
And we're in their way.

358
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:47,607
If they don't come before then,
we're attacking at first light, 0530.

359
00:33:47,775 --> 00:33:50,277
I'll tell the men to fix bayonets.

360
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,614
Not much of a limp.

361
00:33:55,283 --> 00:33:57,701
- I'll survive.
- How is it?

362
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,287
Hurts.

363
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,123
War is hell.

364
00:34:20,641 --> 00:34:22,726
Smith, wake up.

365
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,645
Come on, Smith. Get up.
It's your watch.

366
00:34:26,105 --> 00:34:28,565
Smith. It's your watch.

367
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,860
Easy, Smith. It's me, Talbert!

368
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:35,655
Smith! What the hell are you doing?!
That's Talbert!

369
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:37,657
- I didn't--
- Goddamn!

370
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:41,244
- Gosh!
- Medic!

371
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:44,331
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to.
He looked like a Kraut.

372
00:34:44,874 --> 00:34:46,750
- Can you breathe?
- Yeah, I can breathe.

373
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:49,836
- Look at me. Look at me.
- Yeah, I can breathe!

374
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:52,005
Okay, I'm just gonna put some sulfur on
the wound, Floyd. You're gonna be fine.

375
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:06,186
What the hell is that?

376
00:35:07,522 --> 00:35:11,024
Sounds like it's coming
from 3rd Platoon.

377
00:35:12,527 --> 00:35:15,195
Don't you wanna get some sleep?

378
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:20,033
I don't think-- I don't think I can.

379
00:35:20,535 --> 00:35:23,078
Then go take a look.

380
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:27,457
Yes, sarge.

381
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:02,909
- Flash.
- Thunder. Thunder!

382
00:36:03,244 --> 00:36:05,579
Lieutenant Speirs, sir.

383
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:08,081
Where you going, private?

384
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,917
Check out the noise, sir.

385
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:14,629
I just came from there.
Everything's under control.

386
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,465
Yes, sir.

387
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:24,306
Got some nervous privates
in your company.

388
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:26,266
We do, sir.

389
00:36:26,434 --> 00:36:29,144
Yeah, we do. I can vouch for that.

390
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:32,772
They just don't see how simple it is.

391
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:38,778
How simple what is, sir?

392
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,122
Just do what you have to do.

393
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:53,335
Like you did on D-Day, sir?

394
00:36:55,129 --> 00:36:56,796
Lieutenant...

395
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:05,597
Sir, when I landed on D-Day,
I found myself in a ditch all by myself.

396
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,517
I fell asleep.

397
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:15,982
I think it was the airsickness pills
they gave us.

398
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:25,116
When I woke up,
I didn't really try to find my unit...

399
00:37:25,868 --> 00:37:27,744
...to fight.

400
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:30,163
I just--

401
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:36,169
I just kind of stayed put.

402
00:37:38,422 --> 00:37:41,007
What's your name, trooper?

403
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:44,678
Blithe, sir. Albert Blithe.

404
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,059
You know why you hid
in that ditch, Blithe?

405
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,852
I was scared.

406
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:56,523
We were all scared.

407
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:04,281
You hid in that ditch because you think
there's still hope. But, Blithe...

408
00:38:04,448 --> 00:38:08,535
...the only hope you have is to accept
the fact that you're already dead.

409
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,870
And the sooner you accept that...

410
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:15,041
...the sooner you'll be able to function
as a soldier's supposed to function.

411
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:20,380
Without mercy. Without compassion.
Without remorse.

412
00:38:20,673 --> 00:38:23,883
All war depends upon it.

413
00:38:40,443 --> 00:38:43,987
Got any smokes?
You want some of this candy shit? No?

414
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:46,072
- The outpost got ammo.
- Hey, Boyle.

415
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:49,576
- Here you go, guys.
- We don't know what they've got.

416
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:53,246
We may be attacking a weaker force,
possibly more paratroopers.

417
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:56,458
- And you know how they can be.
- Fire and maneuver.

418
00:38:56,751 --> 00:38:59,085
That's the name of the game:
Fire and maneuver.

419
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:04,299
Dog and Fox companies will be on our
left flank, moving with us. Any questions?

420
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:10,513
- Let's make them holler.
- It's 9:30 in the evening back home.

421
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,265
- Must be--
- Mortar!

422
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:15,977
- Incoming! Everybody in the hole!
- Take cover!

423
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,023
Down, down, down, down!

424
00:39:20,274 --> 00:39:22,150
Get that OP in!

425
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:24,778
Tell them to hold.
I'm checking the lines.

426
00:39:24,945 --> 00:39:28,114
All Easy stations.
Easy 6, hold in position. Over.

427
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:30,450
Go! Lock and load!

428
00:39:35,831 --> 00:39:37,624
- Easy 6! Easy Red 6!
- Medic!

429
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,793
I've got mortars all across my line.

430
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,962
No sign of infantry yet.
I'm pulling the OP in. Over.

431
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:47,133
Right stake plus 15. Charge three!

432
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,802
Range, 600.

433
00:39:49,470 --> 00:39:51,888
Load! Fire!

434
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:55,809
Up and load! Fire!

435
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:02,649
- Come on!
- Come on! Move it! Move it! Hurry!

436
00:40:06,487 --> 00:40:09,197
Watch for silhouettes on the horizon!

437
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:12,492
Find your target. Muzzle fire!

438
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:17,580
- Nail it! Keep low!
- Watch the horizon!

439
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,208
Keep low! Go! Go! Go!

440
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:23,503
Perconte! Perconte!

441
00:40:24,004 --> 00:40:26,756
Get your men in order! Stay low.

442
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:30,093
Pour it on them, Perconte! To your left!

443
00:40:30,344 --> 00:40:32,512
Keep going! Keep going!

444
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:34,305
Keep it up!

445
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,351
I want fire superiority!

446
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:42,689
Guarnere, keep them pinned down!
Keep firing!

447
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:47,735
Sergeants, reverse!
Cover the crest of that hill!

448
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:04,210
No!

449
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:24,439
Where the hell did they come from?

450
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:33,948
Okay, pull back!

451
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:38,453
Holy shit! There goes our left flank!

452
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,789
- Sir, Dog and Fox are pulling back.
- What?

453
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,171
Who gave that order, goddamn it?

454
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:58,097
Keep firing! Stay low!

455
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:00,767
Stay low. Keep firing, Perconte!

456
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:06,397
Come on, Blithe. Stand up!

457
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:09,400
Get up on your feet, soldier.

458
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,319
Get up, Blithe.

459
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:16,449
That's right, Blithe. You can do it.

460
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:21,162
Fire your weapon, Blithe.

461
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,165
Hit those goddamn Germans, Blithe!

462
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,459
Rip it at them, Blithe!

463
00:42:38,180 --> 00:42:41,474
Keep firing! Let them have it!

464
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:44,811
Keep firing! Don't slack it off!

465
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,980
Let them have it, Blithe!

466
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:51,818
Pour it on them, Blithe!

467
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:55,154
The left flank! Watch your left flank!

468
00:42:56,865 --> 00:43:01,828
Fire!

469
00:43:02,037 --> 00:43:07,083
Krauts over there!
Keep the line of fire up here! Move it!

470
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:15,341
Blaze spray!

471
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:21,848
Let's go, McGrath! On me!
Shift your fire right!

472
00:43:25,394 --> 00:43:27,520
Down! Down!

473
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:36,362
Get together!

474
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,576
Come on! You're gonna get me killed,
lieutenant.

475
00:43:44,079 --> 00:43:47,040
I knew you'd get me killed!

476
00:43:49,001 --> 00:43:51,586
- Wait until I tell you, McGrath!
- I can't!

477
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,631
- Hold your fire!
- No, that's too close.

478
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:57,300
- Bitch! Son of a bitch!
- Too close!

479
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,440
Medic!

480
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:14,734
Come on!

481
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:18,112
Now fire, McGrath! Fire!

482
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,282
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

483
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:29,165
- Covering fire!
- Covering fire!

484
00:44:29,416 --> 00:44:32,168
- Keep firing south!
- Fire!

485
00:44:32,336 --> 00:44:34,087
You hit a home run, huh?

486
00:44:37,424 --> 00:44:40,093
- Smith, I've been hit!
- I got you!

487
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:41,678
Get me out of here!

488
00:44:47,601 --> 00:44:48,810
Medic!

489
00:44:50,604 --> 00:44:51,688
Randleman!

490
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:56,067
- You okay? Move it! Move it!
- Yeah.

491
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,204
- Rounds complete!
- Rounds complete!

492
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:11,999
- Skip! More ammo! Go! Go!
- I'm on my way!

493
00:45:12,793 --> 00:45:16,671
Medic!

494
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,520
Jesus, what was that?

495
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,608
Shermans!

496
00:45:39,319 --> 00:45:41,487
Well, hello, 2nd Armored.

497
00:45:48,662 --> 00:45:51,038
That's right, you sorry asses! Run!

498
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:54,667
The cavalry! Come on in! The tanks!

499
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:58,171
Oh, you beautiful babies, you!

500
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:06,512
Let's go! Pour it on them!
Let them have it! Come on!

501
00:46:12,686 --> 00:46:15,188
- Check it out! Shermans!
- About damn time.

502
00:46:31,371 --> 00:46:32,663
Come on!

503
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:20,211
Come on.

504
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:13,890
Hey, buddy.

505
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:16,642
Hey, buddy, you okay?

506
00:48:16,852 --> 00:48:20,146
Looks like you fellas
had a heck of a fight.

507
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:41,000
Move forward on the right flank.

508
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:42,705
We need to know what's in there.

509
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:46,042
- I don't know who the hell to send.
- Ask for volunteers.

510
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:49,128
I hate asking for volunteers.

511
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:51,839
Then pick them.

512
00:50:52,507 --> 00:50:56,218
Need to take a look at that farmhouse.
Who wants to go?

513
00:51:03,435 --> 00:51:05,061
I'll go.

514
00:51:05,228 --> 00:51:07,563
Anybody else?

515
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:12,485
Martin, Dukeman, you just volunteered.
Hubba-hubba.

516
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,738
I'll be lead.

517
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:19,033
Blithe's lead scout. Move out.

518
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:35,174
Harry, what exactly are you doing
with your reserve chute?

519
00:51:35,342 --> 00:51:38,511
You been hauling that thing around
ever since we jumped?

520
00:51:38,678 --> 00:51:40,679
Gonna send it to Kitty
when we get back to England.

521
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:51,357
Silk. I figure it'll make a good wedding dress,
you know, what with rationing and all.

522
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:02,076
- Jeez, Harry, I never would have guessed.
- What? That I'm so sentimental?

523
00:52:02,369 --> 00:52:05,371
No, that you think we're gonna
make it back to England.

524
00:52:29,521 --> 00:52:31,313
Okay.

525
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:36,735
Here we go again. Covering fire!
Covering fire!

526
00:52:37,028 --> 00:52:38,571
Go! Go!

527
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:44,952
Come on! Hang in there, Blithe.
Come on!

528
00:52:45,162 --> 00:52:46,912
Keep moving! Down!

529
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:50,916
- Medic up!
- Top window right!

530
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,420
Hang in there.

531
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:59,550
Medic! We need a medic down here!

532
00:53:00,051 --> 00:53:02,261
Cease fire! Cease fire!

533
00:53:02,470 --> 00:53:07,183
Take it easy, Blithe. Take it easy.
Come on, Dukeman. Come on.

534
00:53:07,434 --> 00:53:09,643
Move, move. Coming through.
Give me room.

535
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:12,855
Get out of my way. I got it.

536
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:16,817
- What happened?
- Sniper.

537
00:53:17,944 --> 00:53:20,529
All right, Blithe, I got you.
Nice and easy. Nice and easy.

538
00:53:20,697 --> 00:53:23,449
They're pulling us off the front line.

539
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:25,367
Now?

540
00:53:25,702 --> 00:53:28,662
To a field camp north of Utah Beach.

541
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:31,373
Hot food and showers.

542
00:53:32,792 --> 00:53:35,211
Then back to England.

543
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:45,804
- Where's medical supply?
- Third tent on the right.

544
00:54:08,161 --> 00:54:09,745
Harry.

545
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:17,544
- How's the leg?
- Stiff. Sore.

546
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,547
They want me to take it easy
for a few days.

547
00:54:20,715 --> 00:54:22,258
Yeah, you should.

548
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,844
Talked to Colonel Sink.

549
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:30,724
Said he appreciated Easy
holding the line.

550
00:54:31,851 --> 00:54:35,396
- Said General Taylor was pleased.
- Yeah.

551
00:54:36,147 --> 00:54:41,652
That's why I came to France,
to please General Taylor.

552
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:44,029
Yeah.

553
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:57,293
In grateful acknowledgment of the blood
shed in the service of your country...

554
00:54:57,544 --> 00:55:02,256
...it is my honor to present you
with the Order of the Purple Heart.

555
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:06,218
Thank you, sir.

556
00:55:18,606 --> 00:55:20,399
How many does that make?

557
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:23,319
Two? Three?

558
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:27,990
- You have no shame.
- Hey, I got one hole in my shoulder...

559
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:31,410
...a second in my calf. Then there's the boil
on my shin that had to be lanced.

560
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:34,204
And he only gets one.

561
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:04,985
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

562
00:56:05,779 --> 00:56:07,613
This is great!

563
00:56:08,823 --> 00:56:10,491
Woo-hoo!

564
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:43,315
- She fancied me, Alton.
- In your dreams, buddy.

565
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:46,151
- Whoa! Jesus!
- Jesus!

566
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:58,080
It's good to be alive!

567
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:08,507
- Jesus Christ, that sure was close.
- No. Missed him by a mile.

568
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:11,009
Hey, Bull. Hey, Bull, come over here.

569
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:12,636
Hey, come on. Bull, come over here.

570
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:15,514
- I got a seat for you.
- Hey, Hoobler.

571
00:57:15,682 --> 00:57:18,100
- Be quiet for the man.
- "The Night of the Bayonet."

572
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:23,439
<i>The night was filled with dark and cold</i>
<i>When Sgt. Talbert, the story's told</i>

573
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:25,858
I don't like this.

574
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:28,402
<i>Pulled on his poncho and headed out</i>

575
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:31,864
<i>To check the lines</i>
<i>Dressed like a Kraut</i>

576
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:33,615
Why is everyone in such a hurry
to get back, huh?

577
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:35,409
- Hospital food don't suit you?
- Get off.

578
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:37,369
We don't need you anymore, Tab.

579
00:57:37,871 --> 00:57:42,332
<i>Upon a trooper our hero came</i>
<i>Fast asleep, he called his name</i>

580
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:48,630
<i>"Smith, oh, Smith! Get up! It's time</i>
<i>To take your turn out on the line"</i>

581
00:57:49,090 --> 00:57:51,216
Do you guys have any idea
what he's talking about?

582
00:57:51,384 --> 00:57:54,136
The night of the bayonet.

583
00:57:54,929 --> 00:57:57,431
- Whatever that is.
<i>- But Smith, so very weary</i>

584
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,142
<i>Cracked an eye, all red and bleary</i>

585
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:04,938
<i>Grabbed his rifle, he did not tarry</i>
<i>Hearing Floyd, but seeing Jerry</i>

586
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:08,609
- Oh, my God.
- Way to go, Smithy!

587
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:10,527
<i>"It's me," cried Tab, "Don't do it!"</i>

588
00:58:10,695 --> 00:58:13,739
<i>And yet Smith charged</i>
Tout de suite, with bayonet

589
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:16,658
<i>- He lunged, he thrust, both high and low</i>
- Oh, come on!

590
00:58:16,868 --> 00:58:19,953
<i>And skewered the boy from Kokomo</i>

591
00:58:20,121 --> 00:58:22,956
I'm heading back to barracks.

592
00:58:24,292 --> 00:58:26,084
- You Heffron?
- Yeah.

593
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:28,754
- Where you from?
- Who's asking?

594
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:31,798
- You from Philadelphia?
- South Philly, yeah.

595
00:58:33,092 --> 00:58:35,302
I could tell.

596
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:39,264
- Seventeenth Street.
- Yeah? Front Street. Hey.

597
00:58:39,766 --> 00:58:41,600
Come here. Sit down.

598
00:58:41,768 --> 00:58:43,477
Hey, you know a guy
named Johnny Waylon?

599
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:44,978
- Yeah, I know Johnny.
- Used to call him Tar Head.

600
00:58:45,146 --> 00:58:46,188
Yeah, Tar Head. Yeah.

601
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:50,275
Since you weren't wounded by the enemy
and thus didn't qualify for a Purple Heart...

602
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:53,987
...we've taken matters
into our own hands.

603
00:58:54,614 --> 00:58:57,115
Tab, this is for you.

604
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:01,995
- A souvenir.
- That's right.

605
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,748
- Congratulations!
- I could've shot the kid a dozen times.

606
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:06,542
Yeah, right.

607
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:09,962
I just didn't think we could
spare a man.

608
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:20,806
Couple of announcements, men.

609
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:23,141
First-- Listen up.

610
00:59:23,351 --> 00:59:29,022
First, the training exercise scheduled
for 2200 has been canceled.

611
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,274
Oh, yeah.

612
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:32,067
Secondly...

613
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:35,070
...all passes are hereby revoked.

614
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:38,490
We're heading back to France,
so pack up all your gear.

615
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:41,994
We will not be returning
to England, boys.

616
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:46,373
Anyone who has not made out a will,
go to the supply office.

617
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:50,752
Trucks depart from Membury at 0700.

618
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:53,547
As you were.

619
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:03,890
Hello?

620
01:00:05,018 --> 01:00:07,728
Good morning, Mrs. Lamb.
Sorry to bother you so early.

621
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:10,355
- That's all right, private...?
- Malarkey.

622
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:13,692
- Come in.
- Actually, it's Sgt. Malarkey now, ma'am.

623
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:16,194
- I just got promoted.
- Oh, lovely.

624
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:20,741
I expect you'll be wanting your laundry.
I heard the trucks rumbling by all night.

625
01:00:20,992 --> 01:00:22,659
I guess the Yanks must be
on their way off again.

626
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:24,745
Yes, ma'am.
Looks like for good this time.

627
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:27,581
I'm sorry to hear that.

628
01:00:28,249 --> 01:00:31,543
Two shirts, two pairs of trousers,
light starch.

629
01:00:31,711 --> 01:00:34,880
Two bob and tuppence, please.

630
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:37,299
I can't--

631
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:40,761
Thank you.

632
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:47,059
Would you like a cup of tea?
I've got the water boiling.

633
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:50,312
No. No, thank you.
I'm in a hell of a--

634
01:00:50,521 --> 01:00:55,067
Bit of a hurry.
But thank you anyway.

635
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:58,654
- Oh, private?
- Yes, ma'am?

636
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:01,740
Lieutenant Meehan's one of yours,
isn't he?

637
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:05,619
I hope he hasn't forgotten his laundry.

638
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:14,753
- I'll take it.
- Thank you.

639
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:30,310
You couldn't be a dear and help me
with a few others, could you?

640
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:32,604
Uh, let's see.

641
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:38,610
Sergeant Evans, Private Moya,
Blowzer...

642
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:41,655
...Gray, Miller...

643
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:45,117
...Owen...

644
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:49,371
...Collins, Elliot...
