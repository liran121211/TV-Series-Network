1
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:36,531
When we left for Bastogne,
we were short of equipment.

2
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:40,827
We didn't have enough ammunition.
We didn't have enough warm clothes.

3
00:02:41,078 --> 00:02:44,413
But we had confidence...

4
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:50,044
...that our higher military authorities
would get to us whatever we needed.

5
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:54,257
And there was a ridge with a tree line.
We were dug in on that ridge.

6
00:02:54,424 --> 00:02:58,928
The Germans knew right where we were,
and they really gave us a shellacking.

7
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:03,933
Well, like in Bastogne we were down to
one round per man there for a while.

8
00:03:04,142 --> 00:03:07,478
There was this-- The fog was in.
They couldn't drop us, couldn't resupply us.

9
00:03:07,771 --> 00:03:10,481
Every time they tried
to drop supplies in to us...

10
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:14,110
...they missed us and dropped them
to the Germans.

11
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,654
One of the guys got hit in the arm
with a piece of shrapnel.

12
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:18,948
Took his arm off above the elbow.

13
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:23,452
They were taking him out and he said,
"Get my wristwatch off my arm."

14
00:03:23,662 --> 00:03:27,123
And then a medic came along
and l think he really saved my life.

15
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:33,129
Because he stuck a Syrette
in a key position. Morphine.

16
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:38,134
Even today on a real cold night,
we go to bed...

17
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:43,472
...my wife will tell you that the first thing
I'll say is, "l'm glad l'm not in Bastogne."

18
00:06:01,737 --> 00:06:04,280
Doc, doc, doc.

19
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:13,808
Doc, bandage.
Take him back to Regiment.

20
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:18,437
As you all know, General McAuliffe,
acting division commander.

21
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:20,356
Give it to me straight.

22
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:24,902
We've been taking ground in one position,
general, losing it in another.

23
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,864
Now it looks like a standoff.
We're digging in on the edge of the forest.

24
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,534
We're under sporadic
artillery fire, general.

25
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,453
We're taking a lot of hits
and we have no aid station.

26
00:07:34,704 --> 00:07:38,332
We've run out of food, we have no winter
clothes, and we have little or no ammo.

27
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:42,753
The line's spread so thin the enemy wanders
into our CP to use our slit trenches, sir.

28
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,381
We just can't cover the line.

29
00:07:45,549 --> 00:07:49,176
Good morning, Captain Nixon.
You got anything to add for Gen. McAuliffe?

30
00:07:49,344 --> 00:07:53,055
General. Yes, sir.

31
00:07:53,265 --> 00:07:59,478
General, l took a walk on our line
about 0300 last night.

32
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,940
I couldn't find the 501 st on our right flank.
I tied it in with a squad...

33
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,569
...from our second platoon, but, sir, we've
got considerable gaps in our perimeter.

34
00:08:06,778 --> 00:08:10,781
I don't have enough people, sir.
We're spread too damn thin.

35
00:08:10,991 --> 00:08:14,285
Hold the line, colonel.
Close the gaps.

36
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:19,498
This goddamn fog won't lift anytime soon,
so you can forget about air cover.

37
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:23,252
Your 1 st Battalion just pulled out of Foy,
Krauts on their tail.

38
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:30,092
Tanks. Artillery. Got no backup.
There's a lot of shit headed this way.

39
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,651
Doc?

40
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:51,405
Can l scrounge a bandage
from your aid kit, sir?

41
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:54,116
How are you fixed?

42
00:08:54,326 --> 00:08:58,454
No plasma, couple of bandages,
practically no morphine.

43
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:02,666
In fact, l tried to find my way up
to 3rd Battalion looking for supplies...

44
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,960
...but l lost my way.

45
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:07,338
If you can't get over to 3rd...

46
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:11,050
...hook up with Doc Ryan, he'll fix you up
with what he has to spare.

47
00:09:11,218 --> 00:09:12,927
Thanks, captain.

48
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:20,351
Eugene? Get everything you can.
You're gonna need it.

49
00:09:24,522 --> 00:09:26,148
-Spina.
-Doc.

50
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:30,027
-What's happening?
-We're digging in right along the line.

51
00:09:30,195 --> 00:09:34,240
Yeah, this is it.
So, what'd you get?

52
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:40,955
I got this,
and l got myself a Kraut bandage.

53
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:52,883
-What? This is it?
-Yeah, that's it. That's all you got.

54
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:01,475
You know, 1 st Battalion's pulled out of Foy.
Heavy casualties.

55
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:03,978
So if they're pulling back, then what
the hell are we doing sitting here?

56
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:07,022
We need morphine. This is all I got.

57
00:10:07,190 --> 00:10:10,693
-You got extra scissors?
-No. Just the one.

58
00:10:10,902 --> 00:10:13,737
-First Sergeant Lipton?
-Sir.

59
00:10:13,989 --> 00:10:18,367
-What's this? Two medics in one hole?
-Yes, sir.

60
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:23,038
What's gonna happen to us
if you take a hit, huh?

61
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:25,249
Sir?

62
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:30,754
-First Sergeant, where's my foxhole?
-lt's back here, sir.

63
00:10:30,922 --> 00:10:34,758
Maybe you missed it, huh?
I'll walk you back.

64
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:39,805
-You're a bit close to the line here.
-Goddamn it.

65
00:10:45,937 --> 00:10:49,106
Sgt. Guarnere, did you keep
your morphine from Holland?

66
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:52,568
-No. Hey, doc, l gotta talk to you.
-How's that leg?

67
00:10:52,736 --> 00:10:55,070
-To hell with the leg, l'm pissing needles.
-Later.

68
00:10:55,238 --> 00:10:56,780
Shit.

69
00:11:03,246 --> 00:11:06,332
-You seen them?
-No.

70
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:10,669
But they're out there.
Depend on it.

71
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:13,505
-Cup of Joe, doc?
-Gordon, I need scissors.

72
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,299
You got scissors? Sharp scissors.

73
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:20,596
Scissors? Well, let's see,
I'll have to check the sewing room.

74
00:11:20,764 --> 00:11:24,266
Might be upstairs in the study, that skinny
old drawer in the middle of the desk.

75
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:28,354
All right. What about an extra Syrette
in your aid kit?

76
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:29,938
Hide your morphine, guys--

77
00:11:32,275 --> 00:11:34,068
-Muck, you all right?
-l'm good.

78
00:11:34,444 --> 00:11:37,946
-Muck, Malarkey, take cover!
-We're okay!

79
00:11:38,156 --> 00:11:42,368
Will you look at this shit?
They peppered my helmet.

80
00:11:42,619 --> 00:11:45,454
Hey, doc! Doc! Morphine!

81
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:48,457
-Here, take it.
-Where's Penkala?

82
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:50,501
Christ knows.

83
00:11:50,710 --> 00:11:53,170
Medic!

84
00:11:57,884 --> 00:12:00,302
Doc!

85
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,724
-Medic!
-You guys hit?

86
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:09,311
-Easy, doc. How you doing?
-Hey, are you crazy?

87
00:12:09,521 --> 00:12:12,022
What are you looking at him for?
Watch the goddamn line!

88
00:12:12,315 --> 00:12:14,733
-You got a Syrette?
-What? No.

89
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,403
Medic!

90
00:12:17,612 --> 00:12:19,154
Go.

91
00:12:19,322 --> 00:12:20,739
Medic!

92
00:12:22,325 --> 00:12:23,951
You'll be okay. The doc's coming!

93
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:27,413
-Doc!
-Penkala!

94
00:12:28,164 --> 00:12:30,749
-lt's the artery. l feel it.
-Penkala, let go.

95
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,000
The goddamn artery!

96
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,503
Penkala, loosen your fingers,
goddamn it! Loosen them now.

97
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:36,630
-l'll bleed to death.
-Relax your arm. Come on!

98
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:38,715
-lt's not the artery.
-l ain't going back, doc.

99
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,218
-What?
-l ain't going nowhere, not in this shit.

100
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:43,053
You don't want to go out
in this shit and you're yelling "medic"?

101
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:45,013
I don't need no go back to no aid station.

102
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:47,683
Well, you're in luck, Penkala, because--

103
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,769
We don't got no aid station.

104
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:01,155
Penkala, scissors. l need scissors.
You got scissors?

105
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:05,367
-What the hell I need scissors for?
-Got your aid kit?

106
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:13,292
Right, well, you don't need this.
Not yet. l do.

107
00:13:16,463 --> 00:13:19,548
-Who got hit?
-Penkala.

108
00:13:21,426 --> 00:13:23,552
All right, here.
This is what l want you to do.

109
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:26,763
I want you to take someone and work
your way over to the 3rd Battalion, all right?

110
00:13:27,056 --> 00:13:30,225
You know what we need. Bandages,
plasma, whatever you can beg, you beg.

111
00:13:30,477 --> 00:13:33,770
All right, and get me some
goddamn scissors. l can't get any.

112
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:38,942
And you get yourself
a hot meal too, huh? Go.

113
00:13:59,047 --> 00:14:01,590
You know, he told me
he's a goddamn virgin.

114
00:14:01,758 --> 00:14:02,883
Who?

115
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:04,885
The replacement in my foxhole, Julian.

116
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:06,720
Yeah?

117
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:11,808
Goddamn virgin. Just a kid.

118
00:14:12,101 --> 00:14:13,936
The only virgin l know
is the Virgin Mary.

119
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:21,276
Hey, Babe. Where the hell are we?

120
00:14:21,444 --> 00:14:23,445
This way.

121
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:28,992
-l don't like it.
-Where the hell's their battalion?

122
00:14:30,537 --> 00:14:33,372
Shit. Come on.

123
00:14:35,375 --> 00:14:37,626
Come on, come on. Give me a hand.

124
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:39,836
Go. Go.

125
00:14:41,339 --> 00:14:45,175
-Come on, Spina. Move.
-l'm moving. l'm moving.

126
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:50,389
Okay, we can spare a few bandages,
but that's it. No morphine.

127
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:52,307
You're gonna have to go back
to Bastogne for plasma.

128
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:54,017
Bastogne? lt took us an hour to find you.

129
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:56,562
-Doesn't your surgeon have plasma?
-We don't have one.

130
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:58,605
No surgeon, no aid station.
Nothing.

131
00:14:58,815 --> 00:15:02,317
-Just me and my buddy.
-Sorry, guys, but we just can't help you.

132
00:15:02,485 --> 00:15:04,570
Take cover!

133
00:15:07,198 --> 00:15:09,074
Get your butts out of here.
We're pulling back!

134
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:12,911
-Come on, let's go.
-Go! Go! Move!

135
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,747
Should've shot Hinkle in the ass,
and he would have shot him in the ass.

136
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:22,296
God bless you.

137
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,927
-These smell like my armpit.
-At least your armpit's warm.

138
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,721
-You want syrup with that?
-Hey, Joe, be honest.

139
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,180
What's in these things anyway?

140
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:35,142
-Nothing you won't eat, Malarkey.
-l won't eat Malarkey.

141
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:37,728
Hey, hey. Maybe Hinkle
would like your share.

142
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,313
I should have shot him
when l had the chance.

143
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,522
What, running backwards, Babe?

144
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:45,694
-Anybody see Lieutenant Dike?
-Try Battalion CP, sir.

145
00:15:45,862 --> 00:15:48,530
-Try Paris.
-Try Hinkle.

146
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,449
Hinkle, sweetie, l'm home.

147
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,368
Hey, Eugene, Lt. Dike's got a full aid kit.
Try him.

148
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:57,080
-Yeah, I'm sure he's not using his.
-Maybe Hinkle's got a Syrette for you.

149
00:15:57,248 --> 00:15:58,248
Eat your strudel.

150
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,709
Hinkle-vinkle, eat the armpit, huh?

151
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:13,472
Lieutenant Dike. Lieutenant.

152
00:16:14,599 --> 00:16:17,726
Can you spare something from your
aid kit, sir? l'm real short. l need Syrettes.

153
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,478
-What, morphine?
-Yes, sir.

154
00:16:19,646 --> 00:16:21,563
Wait a minute. These....

155
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:30,405
-What happens if I get hit?
-l'll be there, sir.

156
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:32,741
-Syrette's in here, right?
-Yes it is.

157
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:39,122
-Here. I don't plan on getting hit.
-Thank you, sir.

158
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:46,505
Heffron. Hey, Heffron, you okay?

159
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:51,259
Gene, what is with the Heffron bullshit?
You know my name. Why don't you use it.

160
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,095
It's Edward, right?

161
00:16:53,388 --> 00:16:57,766
Edward? Are you serious?
Only the goddamn nuns call me "Edward."

162
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,268
Hey, listen, l need to know whether
you kept your morphine from Holland?

163
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:03,188
No. You asked already, remember?

164
00:17:03,398 --> 00:17:06,400
No. I don't recall.

165
00:17:15,785 --> 00:17:18,620
Hey. Hey.

166
00:17:22,792 --> 00:17:24,626
Gordon, you want me?

167
00:17:24,919 --> 00:17:30,215
Oh, yeah, morphine. 3rd Platoon
ponied up the contraband.

168
00:17:30,842 --> 00:17:33,176
-You still looking for scissors?
-Yes I am.

169
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:36,763
-Perconte.
-Perconte.

170
00:17:36,931 --> 00:17:41,309
-Doc.
-Thank you.

171
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:47,524
Oh, and you'd better check on Joe Toye
out on the OP. He's missing something.

172
00:17:48,818 --> 00:17:50,861
Thanks.

173
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:06,668
-You guys okay?
-They got hot food. Can you smell it?

174
00:18:06,878 --> 00:18:08,670
-Toye, you missing something?
-Home.

175
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,506
Ask him to dance, doc.

176
00:18:13,885 --> 00:18:19,222
-Toye, show me your feet.
-You watch the goddamn line, McClung.

177
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:23,518
-Where are your boots?
-ln Washington, up Gen. Taylor's ass.

178
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:25,270
I don't believe this.

179
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:29,065
-l can move better in bare feet, doc.
-What happened?

180
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:33,403
Took them off to dry my goddamn socks,
they got blown to hell, okay.

181
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:39,034
-Well, what's your size?
-Nine, just like everybody else.

182
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:46,666
Frank, you keep cleaning those teeth,
the Germans will see you a mile away.

183
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:47,834
Shoot him dead.

184
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:51,046
That's right, Pee Wee.
You keep laughing.

185
00:18:51,214 --> 00:18:53,048
Hey, doc.

186
00:18:53,216 --> 00:18:56,218
Doc, my stuff. Come on, doc.

187
00:18:56,427 --> 00:18:59,930
-You got a drug store in here?
-No, I own my stuff.

188
00:19:00,223 --> 00:19:05,060
-What are you looking for?
-Scissors. Thank you, Perconte.

189
00:19:05,269 --> 00:19:08,063
My goddamn scissors.

190
00:19:09,732 --> 00:19:12,234
-Sgt. Guarnere.
-Marlene, is that you?

191
00:19:12,527 --> 00:19:15,737
-Hey, doc, come here.
-USO, picking up Syrettes.

192
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:19,574
-Alley, Liebgott, you got any?
-No, got used in Holland, doc.

193
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:22,577
You ain't using this stuff are you, doc?
I mean personal, like.

194
00:19:22,745 --> 00:19:23,745
Come on.

195
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:28,250
Hey, Doc. Doc, l still got the itching.
Every time l pee, it's murder.

196
00:19:28,543 --> 00:19:30,836
Yeah, l'm sorry, but l just l don't have
penicillin for your pirouette.

197
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:32,045
My what?

198
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:34,422
Lieutenant, make sure you move around
a little, get your blood flowing.

199
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:36,925
-l can't feel my feet.
-That's why you gotta move around.

200
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:38,093
You know,
so you don't get trench foot.

201
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:40,053
-Should l take my boots off?
-All you gotta do...

202
00:19:40,221 --> 00:19:42,806
...is just loosen them up
and keep moving.

203
00:19:42,974 --> 00:19:45,016
Sergeant, I'm sorry.
Look, l know it must be hell...

204
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,937
...but l can't help you, all right?
Just drink lots of water.

205
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:53,775
-Water? lt's pissing that hurts.
-Shut it. Shut the hell up.

206
00:19:53,985 --> 00:19:56,111
What's going on here, Bill?
Who the hell's singing?

207
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,113
I'll find out, lieutenant.
I'll find out.

208
00:19:58,281 --> 00:20:01,366
-Stop them from singing.
-l'll shut them up.

209
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:23,972
Lord, grant that I shall never seek so much
to be consoled as to console...

210
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:28,351
...to be understood as to understand,
or to be loved...

211
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:32,898
...as to love with all my heart.

212
00:20:34,609 --> 00:20:37,110
With all my heart.

213
00:20:40,156 --> 00:20:42,699
Medic!

214
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:48,413
Medic! Medic!

215
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:50,999
Oh, Christ!

216
00:20:51,167 --> 00:20:53,501
-Perconte, you getting a jeep?
-l'm on it, doc.

217
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:57,172
-Look what they did to my leg.
-Easy CP, this is Perconte.

218
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,924
-Bear with me. Bear with me.
-Sisk has been hit...

219
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,677
...and l need a jeep. I say it again,
I need a jeep now.

220
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,847
They're moving, goddamn it!
We need it now!

221
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,143
You'll be all right, Sisk.

222
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:16,691
-Okay, Sisk. lt ain't that bad, ain't that bad.
-lt ain't that bad?

223
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,407
Okay, one pull.

224
00:21:24,659 --> 00:21:28,036
No, doc, save the morphine.
I can make it. l can make it. Save it.

225
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:31,373
All right, let's get him out of here.

226
00:21:37,088 --> 00:21:39,881
-Where's the goddamn jeep?
-l don't know, but I hear it.

227
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:45,220
-Jesus Christ!
-Skinny, you got blood all over my trousers.

228
00:21:45,388 --> 00:21:48,974
-l'm real sorry, Frank.
-Get him up.

229
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:54,062
Damn it, Skinny.

230
00:21:54,814 --> 00:21:57,565
Tell Spina l went in for plasma.

231
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:07,617
All the tanks, artillery,
are pulled back to here.

232
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:10,954
We got no backup beyond Bastogne.
This is it.

233
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:14,457
The Krauts captured the 326th Medical
and they took everybody.

234
00:22:14,709 --> 00:22:19,921
Doctors, medics, the whole shebang.
We got nothing.

235
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:26,594
They're giving the boys
hooch for the pain.

236
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:30,932
-He took a mortar hit. Watch the leg.
-Yeah, watch the leg.

237
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:33,268
Get him in.

238
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:44,779
-Move it.
-Coming through.

239
00:22:44,989 --> 00:22:47,365
Move it, fellas.

240
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:59,502
-No, no. Here. Put him here.
-Yes, ma'am.

241
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:05,133
-ls he bad?
-No, lower-leg wound. No morphine.

242
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:12,807
-Nurse, have you got plasma I can--?
-Wait. Please.

243
00:23:44,006 --> 00:23:46,091
Hey, what's going on here?
Why ain't these men evacuated?

244
00:23:46,258 --> 00:23:48,343
We can't evacuate. We're cut off.

245
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:51,429
This is as far as it goes.

246
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,582
I'm in heaven, doc.

247
00:24:20,334 --> 00:24:23,711
-Nurse.
-This way.

248
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:30,426
I need morphine. l need bandages.
Whatever you got. We're down to nothing.

249
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:35,223
Okay, l can give you a little,
but not a lot.

250
00:24:37,226 --> 00:24:41,479
-You can have this today. Do you want that?
-Oui. You got plasma?

251
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:45,733
-A little. Are you a surgeon?
-No. We don't got no surgeon.

252
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:48,987
-What's this?
-From the bed.

253
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:51,573
-What, sheets?
-Yes, for bandages.

254
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:53,074
Okay.

255
00:25:03,586 --> 00:25:07,589
-My name is Renee.
-l'm Gene. Eugene Roe.

256
00:25:07,882 --> 00:25:12,010
-Where are you from?
-Louisiana. Half-Cajun.

257
00:25:22,438 --> 00:25:25,190
Can you get me back to the line?

258
00:25:25,441 --> 00:25:27,400
Sure.

259
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:34,282
Eugene.

260
00:26:04,313 --> 00:26:06,439
-Amen.
-Amen.

261
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:12,237
Fight well for your God and your
country. God bless you all. Stay safe.

262
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:14,989
That's it, guys.
Nothing more to worry about.

263
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:20,536
We gonna die now, we gonna die
in a state of grace. Isn't that right, Babe?

264
00:26:20,829 --> 00:26:23,706
Battalion want a reconnaissance patrol.
Kraut hunting.

265
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:30,213
All right, l'll go. Take these. And give the
boots to Joe Toye. Tell him they're a nine.

266
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:38,221
Keep going till we make
some kind of contact.

267
00:26:38,389 --> 00:26:40,014
-Peacock's leading, right?
-Right.

268
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:43,977
That asshole couldn't find a snowball
in a blizzard.

269
00:26:44,186 --> 00:26:45,520
That's what's happening.
That's the order.

270
00:26:45,688 --> 00:26:46,771
-Sarge?
-Yeah.

271
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:49,357
-Julian.
-Let me be the lead scout.

272
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:52,068
-Back in line, private.
-All right, that's it. Let's move out.

273
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:53,861
Tactical columns, gentlemen.

274
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:59,242
Doc, it's a combat patrol. Why don't you
stay back and keep your ass out of trouble?

275
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:01,869
-Yes, sergeant.
-Yeah.

276
00:27:07,126 --> 00:27:10,211
Come on, Hoobler, pick it up.

277

-Fire!
-Get down! Get down! Jesus!

280
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,047
Shit.

282
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:14,609

-We got a man down!

283
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:19,697
-What have we got?
-Kid's down. Julian.

284
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:23,451
-We gotta make a move.
-l can get him, sarge.

285
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:26,454
-Suppressing fire!
-Suppressing fire.

286
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:30,666
-One man down. Easy.
-Covering fire.

287
00:28:30,959 --> 00:28:33,795
Hold them down!

288
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:38,800
Easy CP, right to my left.
I have one man down.

289
00:28:43,639 --> 00:28:49,644
Okay. Stay there. Don't move.
Stop moving or they'll keep shooting.

290
00:28:56,985 --> 00:29:01,197
-What's happening, sir?
-We're pulling back. We made contact.

291
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:04,492
I gotta get to the CP.

292
00:29:09,123 --> 00:29:14,669
Don't move. Stop moving
or they'll keep firing. Stop moving!

293
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:18,047
Fuck. Sarge, what--?

294
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:21,759
Pull back! We gotta pull back!

295
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:24,887
-Let's get the hell out of here!
-Let's go!

296
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,266
-Move!

322
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:20,795
We couldn't get to him, captain. We tried.
Babe tried. We couldn't get to him.

323
00:31:31,974 --> 00:31:36,018
Hey, Bull.
Let me sit in here with you guys.

324
00:32:26,028 --> 00:32:28,362
Heffron?

325
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:31,449
Toye.

326
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:34,869
What you doing out here?

327
00:32:36,038 --> 00:32:39,206
Thanks for the boots, doc.
Doing fine.

328
00:32:39,416 --> 00:32:42,710
Are you still having trouble
with your feet?

329
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:46,964
Show me. Let me see it.

330
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:05,358
It's trench foot, Toye. If it turns
gangrene, you could lose it.

331
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:08,653
I ain't coming off the line, doc.

332
00:33:12,491 --> 00:33:16,243
Well, you gotta stay dry.
Massage your feet.

333
00:33:16,453 --> 00:33:19,747
Change socks every day
and dry the wet ones around your neck.

334
00:33:19,915 --> 00:33:21,499
-Trying.
-Do it.

335
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,959
I'm working on it.

336
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:34,136
-You seen Heffron?
-No. Why?

337
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:37,014
He ain't in his hole.

338
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,602
Fuck.

339
00:33:53,323 --> 00:33:55,616
Got you.

340
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:04,959
Heffron.

341
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,637
Edward.

342
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,642
Eat it.

343
00:34:26,148 --> 00:34:28,315
Good.

344
00:34:31,987 --> 00:34:34,363
All right.

345
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:47,001
I promised him if he got hit, l'd get
his stuff and bring it to his mom, you know?

346
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:54,258
-Now the fucking Krauts'll strip him.
-Hey, no. lt's okay.

347
00:34:54,509 --> 00:34:58,512
It's not. It's not okay.

348
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:02,016
I should have got to him.

349
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:39,386
Hey, what do you call those people again?
Those Cajun healers?

350
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:42,765
Traiteurs.

351
00:35:43,058 --> 00:35:47,895
-You know, my grandma was a traiteuse.
-Your grandmother? No shit?

352
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:54,109
She was. Laid her hands
on people and cured them.

353
00:35:54,736 --> 00:35:58,531
Took away sickness, cancer,
you name it.

354
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:02,910
Your grandma did that?
You're shitting me.

355
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,540
-l remember she used to pray a lot.
-Yeah, I guess she had to.

356
00:36:07,749 --> 00:36:11,669
Talked to God
about the pain she pulled out.

357
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,924
Asked him to carry it away.

358
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:24,640
That's what she did.

359
00:36:25,267 --> 00:36:32,064
Jesus. l'm still trying to figure why they
picked me for a medic. God knows.

360
00:36:33,108 --> 00:36:38,112
Snap of a finger and just like that,
you're a medic.

361
00:36:39,155 --> 00:36:42,491
I've had enough playing doctor.

362
00:36:43,618 --> 00:36:47,496
Hey, how about you?

363
00:38:17,712 --> 00:38:20,089
Take cover!

364
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:28,722
Cease fire! Cease fire, goddamn it!

365
00:38:28,932 --> 00:38:30,975
Sergeant, I don't understand.
It was our own planes.

366
00:38:34,187 --> 00:38:39,900
C-47s. They're bringing supplies.
It's a drop. It's a drop. Come on!

367
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:21,775
All right, you help the doc.
The rest of you, come with me.

368
00:39:33,496 --> 00:39:36,040
-Medic!
-Someone give us a hand here.

369
00:39:36,291 --> 00:39:38,709
-Help!
-Coming through.

370
00:39:41,963 --> 00:39:45,799
This one through here. Now!

371
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:03,984
The artery, we gotta find the artery.

372
00:40:15,497 --> 00:40:28,175
Anna!

373
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:40,080
Where did she come from?

374
00:41:41,875 --> 00:41:44,251
The black girl.

375
00:41:46,421 --> 00:41:48,630
The Congo.

376
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,801
How'd she get here?

377
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:58,891
Just like me. She came to help.

378
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,134
What?

379
00:42:35,637 --> 00:42:38,305
Your hands.

380
00:42:40,433 --> 00:42:42,643
My hands?

381
00:42:46,314 --> 00:42:49,149
You're a good nurse.

382
00:42:55,240 --> 00:43:00,702
No. I never want to treat
another wounded man again.

383
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:04,331
I'd rather work in a butcher's shop.

384
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:13,507
But your touch calms people.

385
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:19,763
-That's a gift from God.
-No, it's not a gift.

386
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:23,100
God would never give
such a painful thing.

387
00:43:35,029 --> 00:43:38,991
Nurse! Nurse!

388
00:43:39,701 --> 00:43:42,703
We need some help over here.

389
00:43:43,204 --> 00:43:47,708
-Got shrapnel though the stomach.
-How bad is it?

390
00:43:48,418 --> 00:43:51,253
Okay, get this one in first.

391
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:26,747
-Now we know how they felt.
-What? Who?

392
00:44:26,956 --> 00:44:33,670
The legionnaires. When they were watching
the Huns. Goths, the Visigoths.

393
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:37,424
Visigoths? Jesus Christ.

394
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:42,429
Barbarians.
They came right through here.

395
00:44:42,597 --> 00:44:48,435
Right through these trees. Just sweeping
down to burn the shit out of Rome.

396
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:51,772
That's a hell of a long ride.

397
00:44:53,274 --> 00:44:56,943
So, what's college like, Buck?
You got time to hit the books...

398
00:44:57,111 --> 00:45:01,323
...with cheerleaders
running their fingers through your hair?

399
00:45:01,616 --> 00:45:07,371
Hell, Babe, l can't even remember.

400
00:45:11,834 --> 00:45:16,004
-Hey, it's doc.
-Sergeant. Heffron. Lieutenant.

401
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:18,840
Wrap up.

402
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:23,136
Never calls anybody by their nickname.

403
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:26,181
-He once called me Edward.
-ls that right?

404
00:45:26,474 --> 00:45:30,352
-Edward? That's your name?
-Yeah.

405
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:36,483
Funny, you....
You don't look like an Edward.

406
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:21,945
Hey, doc. lt's gonna get busy, pal.

407
00:46:22,363 --> 00:46:24,489
Hold your fire, boys.
Don't let them draw you out.

408
00:46:24,657 --> 00:46:26,575
-Hold your fire!
-Stay ready, boys.

409
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,869
What the hell
are we gonna hit those things with, Lip?

410
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:33,915
Stay ready.
Hold your fire. Get ready, Walter.

411
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:37,544
Stay in your holes, guys.

412
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,505
All you back, platoon, you stay ready!

413
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,759
-Roe, Smokey's hit.
-Medic!

414
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:48,972
Hey, Gene, let's go.
Come on, let's go!

415
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:51,892
Okay, go!

416
00:46:55,897 --> 00:46:58,315
Medic!

417
00:47:00,568 --> 00:47:02,194
-Doc!
-Smokey?

418
00:47:02,403 --> 00:47:04,571
-Hi, Mo.
-l got it. l'm keeping it for you.

419
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,115
-Smoke!
-l can't feel my legs, Gene.

420
00:47:07,408 --> 00:47:09,284
Take it easy. My foxhole,
get the plasma, now!

421
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:11,995
Here they come!

422
00:47:16,584 --> 00:47:21,713
-Yeah, I got it. Go!
-Machine guns, open fire!

423
00:47:37,605 --> 00:47:40,607
-Shift fire, shift fire!
-Left!

424
00:47:54,956 --> 00:47:57,791
Sergeant Lipton!

425
00:48:01,629 --> 00:48:04,464
Doc, we gotta get the hell
out of here.

426
00:48:04,674 --> 00:48:09,261
Hey, come on. Stay with us, Smokey.
Stay with us!

427
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:12,138
Doc, we gotta get the hell
out of here!

428
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:13,974
Keep the line!

429
00:48:15,142 --> 00:48:19,020
You ready? All right, go!

430
00:48:27,822 --> 00:48:31,157
-Stop. We gotta stop.
-All right.

431
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:35,704
-Take the plasma.
-All right.

432
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:37,998
Hey, hey.

433
00:48:38,165 --> 00:48:42,335
Come on, Walt.
Come on, buddy.

434
00:48:42,545 --> 00:48:45,005
Hurry, doc. Come on, doc.
I gotta get back to the line.

435
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:47,048
Okay, okay.

436
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,050
-Lip.
-Yeah, buddy?

437
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:54,306
-You're standing on my hand.
-Sorry, pal.

438
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:57,434
Look, l'll get you
another Purple Heart for it.

439
00:48:57,602 --> 00:48:59,477
Hey!

440
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:04,649
Hey! Hey, give us a hand!

441
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,527
I got you a ride, doc.

442
00:49:20,416 --> 00:49:22,626
Jones.

443
00:49:25,046 --> 00:49:28,715
Give it here.
Okay, put him here.

444
00:49:29,759 --> 00:49:34,137
Where's his tag? Where's his tag?
What's wrong with him?

445
00:49:34,388 --> 00:49:38,058
-Paralyzed.
-What?

446
00:49:38,267 --> 00:49:42,103
He's paralyzed. Can't feel a thing.

447
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:54,616
In the name of the Father, of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

448
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:06,878
Eugene?

449
00:50:07,755 --> 00:50:11,383
-Eugene.
-Renee!

450
00:50:13,928 --> 00:50:17,472
-Are you--?
-Renee, I need some help here.

451
00:50:17,682 --> 00:50:19,474
Are you all right?

452
00:50:19,642 --> 00:50:21,393
Renee.

453
00:50:38,786 --> 00:50:40,787
Here you go, man.

454
00:50:40,955 --> 00:50:43,540
One for the doc.

455
00:50:53,634 --> 00:50:54,926
Doc.

456
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:13,653
I was sitting down to a Christmas Eve dinner
of turkey and hooch back at Division CP.

457
00:51:13,863 --> 00:51:18,241
Damned if l don't like Old Joe Domingus'
rancid-ass beans better.

458
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:21,995
-Hello, Easy Company.
-Hello, sir.

459
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:25,290
General McAuliffe sent a message
to the entire division.

460
00:51:25,458 --> 00:51:27,417
Thought maybe your people
would like to hear it.

461
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:31,087
-Oh, that should be your prerogative, sir.
-All right.

462
00:51:32,006 --> 00:51:33,882
Men...

463
00:51:35,092 --> 00:51:39,471
...General McAuliffe wishes us all
a "Merry Christmas."

464
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:43,016
"What's merry about all this, you ask?
Just this:

465
00:51:43,184 --> 00:51:47,020
We've stopped cold
everything that's been thrown at us...

466
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:50,231
...from the North, East,
South and West.

467
00:51:50,399 --> 00:51:55,862
Now two days ago, the German commander
demanded our honorable surrender...

468
00:51:56,030 --> 00:52:00,700
...to save the U.S.A. encircled troops
from total annihilation.

469
00:52:00,910 --> 00:52:04,245
The German commander received
the following reply.

470
00:52:04,497 --> 00:52:09,250
'To the German commander: Nuts!'

471
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:16,132
We're giving our country and our loved ones
at home a worthy Christmas present...

472
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:19,511
...and being privileged to take part
in this gallant feat of arms...

473
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:24,015
...we are truly making for ourselves
a Merry Christmas."

474
00:52:24,225 --> 00:52:27,435
-Merry Christmas and God bless you.
-Nuts, sir!

475
00:52:27,728 --> 00:52:29,646
Nuts!

476
00:53:33,961 --> 00:53:36,087
Bill.

477
00:53:37,965 --> 00:53:40,633
Picture of my girl.

478
00:53:40,968 --> 00:53:43,887
Good-looking broad, Buck.

479
00:53:46,098 --> 00:53:48,308
She's....

480
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:53,146
She's finished with me.

481
00:53:54,189 --> 00:53:57,650
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

482
00:53:59,653 --> 00:54:02,405
Yeah. She's....

483
00:54:08,329 --> 00:54:11,623
Just in time for Christmas, huh?

484
00:54:15,502 --> 00:54:18,546
Just in time for Christmas.

485
00:54:20,132 --> 00:54:24,177
Shit, I almost forgot.

486
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:30,016
-"Lucky Strikes means fine tobacco."
-Where the hell did you get those?

487
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:35,772
Merry Christmas, fellas.
You gotta thank jolly old "Saint Luz."

488
00:54:35,940 --> 00:54:38,358
-Beautiful.
-Here.

489
00:54:45,950 --> 00:54:48,576
Here you go, Penk.

490
00:54:48,786 --> 00:54:53,873
I am shaking so goddamn much,
I feel like I'm dancing.

491
00:54:54,083 --> 00:54:56,376
Here you go, buddy.
There you go.

492

00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:25,488
-Fire's not a good idea.

00:55:26,407 --> 00:55:31,077
-We're in a dell.
-A dell?

499
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:36,582

00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,423
I swear l thought
I could smell a fire.

501
00:55:43,716 --> 00:55:48,094

Are you out of your mind?

502
00:55:48,303 --> 00:55:51,014
-No, we're in a dell.

The captain's yelling. Come on, get up.

516
00:56:34,725 --> 00:56:36,100
-Okay.
-Okay.

517
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:37,894
Okay, get up. Not okay to lie down.

518

519
00:56:45,069 --> 00:56:47,278

It's just a scratch, Harry.
You're not getting out of here this easy.

525

-Opposite thigh.

529

01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:54,293
-Yeah.
-Hey, how'd you do that?

545
01:01:55,128 --> 01:01:57,671
You did that.

546
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:02,134
I'll fix it up.

547
01:02:30,163 --> 01:02:34,125
Hey, Gene, you called me "Babe."

548
01:02:34,334 --> 01:02:37,378

549
01:02:38,505 --> 01:02:40,923

550
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:46,345
Babe.

551
01:02:48,515 --> 01:02:50,015

552
01:02:55,647 --> 01:02:57,773
Babe.

553
