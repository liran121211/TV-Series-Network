1
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,903
We had lost some very good men there.

2
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:38,323
Toye and Guarnere had lost
their legs there.

3
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:43,620
Gordon was badly hit.
A number of other people were killed.

4
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:47,291
It was a difficult situation there.

5
00:02:47,458 --> 00:02:52,504
I don't know the exact amount
of men that got killed in that.

6
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:58,468
But six, seven of them were
real close friends of mine.

7
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:02,973
Skip Muck died, and Eugene Roe
came to me...

8
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:06,602
...about 10 minutes
after he was killed.

9
00:03:06,769 --> 00:03:10,022
He wanted to see
if I wanted to go look at him.

10
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,484
I said, "No. I wouldn't be able
to stand that." So I didn't go look at him.

11
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:17,279
After Bastogne, we went to Haguenau.
There was another push there.

12
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:20,115
We wanted to get some idea
what was across the river there...

13
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,992
...what kind of strength they had.

14
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,870
You have a feeling
you're gonna live through the war.

15
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:29,541
You have a feeling
it's starting to ease off.

16
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:31,919
You can't account for it...

17
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:35,756
...it's a gut feeling,
but everybody had that feeling.

18
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:39,509
I believe I might be able
to live through it.

19
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:44,389
So walk carefully.
Take care of yourself.

20
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,000
The 101st Airborne
<i>had been made famous...</i>

21
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:14,753
<i>...by what it did</i>
<i>in the Battle of the Bulge.</i>

22
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,589
<i>Newspapers called them</i>
<i>"The Battered Bastards of Bastogne."</i>

23
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,341
<i>They'd been through hell on earth...</i>

24
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:22,719
<i>...and were now pulling into</i>
<i>the comparative paradise of Haguenau...</i>

25
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:26,640
<i>...the sounds of the war still</i>
<i>coming from just across the river.</i>

26
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,433
<i>I had missed Bastogne.</i>

27
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:32,104
<i>All I knew was what I had read and heard</i>
<i>around the replacement depot.</i>

28
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:35,023
<i>That we had broken the back of the enemy</i>
<i>and the war would soon be over.</i>

29
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:37,276
Thanks for the lift.

30
00:04:38,403 --> 00:04:41,196
<i>When I was finally able to rejoin</i>
<i>Easy Company...</i>

31
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:45,492
<i>...they looked nothing like the heroes</i>
<i>who had just helped win the war.</i>

32
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,080
- George Luz!
- Yeah?

33
00:04:50,248 --> 00:04:53,458
It's me. Come on,
I haven't been gone that long.

34
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:56,461
Jesus. Yes, you have.

35
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,506
Now, look what I've found.

36
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,217
Hey, guys. Sgt. Martin, Sgt. Ran--

37
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,553
What do you want, private?

38
00:05:05,513 --> 00:05:09,516
Sorry, sir. My name's David Webster,
I just got back from the hospital.

39
00:05:09,726 --> 00:05:11,643
Good for you.

40
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,607
- Where's the rest of the guys?
- This is everybody.

41
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,861
Come on, Sgt. Martin,
this can't be everybody.

42
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:24,948
What about Hoobler, where's he?

43
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:32,372
You know, Lt. Foley, 2nd Platoon
lost more guys than we did.

44
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:34,458
They're really short-handed.

45
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:37,669
Yeah, right. Report to 2nd, Webster.
They'll find a place for you

46
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:41,381
Next truck up, Webster,
you'll find 2nd. Move.

47
00:05:54,354 --> 00:05:55,896
Hey, guys.

48
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,775
Some lieutenant told me
to report to 2nd.

49
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:06,198
- Your name's Jackson, right?
- That's right.

50
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,284
Who's leading the platoon?

51
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:11,912
- Sgt. Malarkey.
- No officers?

52
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,581
- I guess you didn't hear.
- No, what?

53
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:18,418
They're making Malarkey a lieutenant.
He's on the fast track now.

54
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:21,004
- Really? That's great.
- Isn't it?

55
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,715
Jackson, help me up, will you?

56
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:35,519
- So you come from the hospital?
- Yeah.

57
00:06:35,686 --> 00:06:40,690
Must have liked that hospital, because
we left Holland four months ago.

58
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:44,986
I wasn't there the whole time. There was
rehabilitation, then the replacement depot.

59
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:49,116
I'm sure you tried to bust out
and help us in Bastogne.

60
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:53,412
- I don't know how I would've done that.
- That's funny, because Popeye found a way.

61
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:57,165
So did Alley, back in Holland.
And Guarnere--

62
00:06:57,333 --> 00:07:00,377
Where is Guarnere?
He still platoon sergeant?

63
00:07:00,545 --> 00:07:01,837
- No.
- Let's go.

64
00:07:02,004 --> 00:07:04,339
- He got hit.
- Yeah?

65
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:07,884
Yeah, Bill got hit.
Blew his whole leg off.

66
00:07:08,052 --> 00:07:11,054
1 st Platoon, moving out!

67
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:18,145
Spread out. Hold along this line till
I figure out where we're going.

68
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,856
Sarge? Sarge--

69
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:34,744
What's the matter, Webster?
Nervous in the service?

70
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,205
No, no, I'm fine, sarge.

71
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:40,584
Why don't you go talk to Capt. Speirs.
Make sure he wants you with us.

72
00:07:40,751 --> 00:07:43,962
Capt. Speirs?
What happened to Capt. Winters?

73
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,965
He's running
the whole battalion now. Go.

74
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:51,303
<i>Easy Company had a new C.O.</i>
<i>to go along with all the other new faces.</i>

75
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:55,307
<i>The guys I knew were either gone</i>
<i>or very different from what I remembered.</i>

76
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,226
<i>I was a veteran of D-Day</i>
<i>and Market Garden, and had been...</i>

77
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:01,980
<i>...with the company since its formation,</i>
<i>but now, because I had missed Bastogne...</i>

78
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:06,318
<i>...I was treated as a replacement</i>
<i>and felt like I was starting all over again.</i>

79
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:09,946
- Look who it is. Nice digs, huh, Lip?
- Yeah.

80
00:08:10,114 --> 00:08:12,365
- Sgt. Lipton?
- Look what I found.

81
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:15,702
- Feeling all right?
- There you go. He's got pneumonia.

82
00:08:15,912 --> 00:08:16,912
I'm sorry to hear that.

83
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,330
What are you sorry about?

84
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:22,250
He's alive, he's got a couch,
a goddamn blanket. He's snug as a bug.

85
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:26,713
Sgt. Malarkey said to check with the CO
if I should be in 2nd Platoon.

86
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:30,467
Have a seat, Webster.
We'll get you situated.

87
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:34,304
How long have you been sick?

88
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,431
Long enough.

89
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:42,729
- He wants us to cross.
- Yeah, I bet that water's cold.

90
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:46,066
Should be able to get you some boats.

91
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:51,780
Had to be a full moon.
So much for the cover of darkness.

92
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,449
It's gonna leave the patrol exposed.

93
00:08:57,578 --> 00:09:01,122
- Is this the company CP for Easy?
- Yes, sir.

94
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:04,960
As you were.
Lt. Jones looking for Capt. Speirs.

95
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:08,588
He's on his way, sir.
Why don't you sit down?

96
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,091
Can you get me coffee?
Want coffee?

97
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:13,468
- No, thank you.
- All right.

98
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,016
What platoon are you in?

99
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,519
We're about to find that out.

100
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:26,606
- You got any soap? I need a shave.
- I'll send some down.

101
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:30,402
- Know what you'll do for this? Right.
- I'm gonna let Speirs handle it.

102
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:34,155
Capt. Speirs, sir. This is Lt. Jones.

103
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:35,574
Listen. For chrissake.

104
00:09:35,741 --> 00:09:38,702
Will you go back in the back and sack out?
There's beds back there with fresh sheets.

105
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:42,706
I will, sir. Just trying
to make myself useful, sir.

106
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:44,874
Listen up.

107
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:48,920
Regiment wants patrol for prisoners.

108
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:52,716
This one comes straight from Col. Sink,
so it's not my idea.

109
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:56,386
Since the river is the main line of resistance,
we're gonna have to cross it to get to them.

110
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,887
What do we need to do?

111
00:09:58,055 --> 00:10:01,349
There's a three-story building
on the enemy side, up the embankment.

112
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:03,476
We know it's occupied.
You can have 15 men.

113
00:10:03,644 --> 00:10:06,563
Think very hard about
who you want to lead the patrol.

114
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:11,359
You'll need a lead scout, a translator.
I've got the entire battalion on covering fire.

115
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:13,653
- When?
- Tonight. 0100.

116
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:15,947
- Yes, sir.
- Speirs?

117
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,866
I want this one to be
as foolproof and as safe as possible.

118
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:22,871
Don't take any chances on this one.
We're too far along for that.

119
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,915
Speirs? I wanna discuss
who might go.

120
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:29,085
- Who are you?
- Lt. Jones, sir.

121
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:31,838
Right, our West Pointer.

122
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,257
- Yes, sir.
- When did you graduate?

123
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:35,634
June 6, sir.

124
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,762
June 6? Of last year?

125
00:10:38,929 --> 00:10:40,972
D-Day, yes, sir.

126
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:44,934
All right, don't get hurt.

127
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:48,188
Sir, I'd like to volunteer
for the patrol.

128
00:10:49,482 --> 00:10:52,108
- Speirs, talk to you in an hour.
- Yeah.

129
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,027
Lt. Jones.

130
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:58,698
We're short on officers.
You think a non-com could lead this?

131
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:02,243
I can think of a few possibilities.

132
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,537
Martin? Malarkey? Grant?

133
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,748
Honestly, sir,
most of the NCOs could use a rest.

134
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:10,001
Captain. Request permission to go
on the patrol.

135
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:13,421
There's your answer.

136
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,050
No. You don't have any experience.

137
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:19,928
- Report to 2nd Platoon.
- Yes, sir.

138
00:11:20,096 --> 00:11:21,429
Tell...

139
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:25,892
Tell Heffron, Ramirez
and McClung they're going.

140
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:27,519
Yes, sir.

141
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,771
Sir, this is Pvt. Webster.

142
00:11:29,939 --> 00:11:32,565
Sir, I'm Pvt. Webster
from 1 st Platoon.

143
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:35,318
I just got back from the hospital.

144
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,446
Lt. Foley told me to go to 2nd,
but Sgt. Malarkey--

145
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:42,409
- Fine, 2nd. Take...
- Lt. Jones.

146
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:45,286
Lieutenant. OP 2.

147
00:11:51,419 --> 00:11:52,919
Come on.

148
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:04,180
- Are other officers in the platoon?
- No, sir, just Sgt. Malarkey.

149
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:09,477
They tell me he's getting a battlefield
commission. Maybe he'll be assisting you.

150
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:12,689
Who's that? Webster?

151
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:15,066
That's right. How you doing, Sgt. Kiehn?

152
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:16,901
- Hi, Webster.
- Hi, sarge.

153
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:21,197
- Look what we scrounged. We got spuds.
- Is OP 2 this way?

154
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,659
Shit! Move! Go!

155
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,080
Shit, they spotted us!

156
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:31,291
- Is that it?
- I don't know. I think so.

157
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,793
Go! Go! Go!

158
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:40,467
Come on!
Get over here, get over here!

159
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,263
All clear! All clear!

160
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:47,015
Okay, okay.

161
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:57,233
Ready?

162
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:03,239
- Wait. It was Heffron, McClung and--
- Ramirez. Come on.

163
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,913
- Hey, guys, this taken?
- Go ahead.

164
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:18,963
Sergeant, this is Lt. Jones,
just assigned to 2nd Platoon.

165
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:20,673
Platoon Sgt. Malarkey.

166
00:13:20,841 --> 00:13:24,260
Congratulations on
the battlefield commission.

167
00:13:24,845 --> 00:13:28,723
- The what?
- They're making you an officer, no?

168
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:32,727
Me? No. You must be thinking
of 1 st Sgt. Lipton.

169
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:36,981
My mistake. So you're
without a platoon leader?

170
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,943
Not anymore, lieutenant.

171
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,111
Right.

172
00:13:46,033 --> 00:13:49,118
So you wanna introduce me to the men?

173
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:55,375
Well, some are sleeping downstairs.
The rest are right here.

174
00:13:59,755 --> 00:14:04,968
Sergeant, a patrol's being planned
for tonight, 0100. Across the river.

175
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:08,805
Regiment wants POWs
for interrogation.

176
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:10,723
What's the situation?

177
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:12,308
- Hey, Web.
- What?

178
00:14:12,476 --> 00:14:15,311
Come here.
I wanna talk to you a second.

179
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:16,688
Why?

180
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:19,816
- You want some coffee?
- No.

181
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,318
- Fifteen.
- Fifteen what?

182
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:23,820
Looeys since D-Day.

183
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,489
- Any mortars?
- 60s out back.

184
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:29,033
- He out of high school?
- West Point.

185
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:32,287
West Point? isn't that where Ike went?

186
00:14:32,454 --> 00:14:36,875
- Yeah. He graduated with his son.
- Shit. So...

187
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,421
What do you know
about this patrol thing?

188
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:43,965
- Nothing.
- Oh, come on. You gotta know something.

189
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:46,801
- I don't.
- Bullshit.

190
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:50,930
You were there, right? At the CP.
This is a prisoner snatch, right?

191
00:14:51,098 --> 00:14:53,725
Hey, Chuck, listen to this.

192
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,312
Come on, Webster. Spill it.

193
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:03,443
Capt. Speirs is to pick 15 men.

194
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,738
Lt. Jones wants to be one of them.

195
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:10,158
Let the kid go.
He could use the experience.

196
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:13,411
Probably could find
14 replacements to help him out.

197
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:17,206
I take it this was already an outpost
when you arrived?

198
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:20,501
There were some doggies from
the 79th infantry, but they left in a hurry.

199
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:25,340
- What's the report on enemy activity?
- Expect some flares, a few mortars at night.

200
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:27,050
Scattered 88s, snipers during the day.

201
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:30,637
Yeah, we dodged some mortars
on our way in.

202
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:36,809
We also got some sort
of rail road gun back there.

203
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:42,065
Shells about the size of a deuce and a half.
Sounds like a freight train.

204
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:43,566
They haven't made any attempts...

205
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:46,277
- ...to cross the river?
- No.

206
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:49,405
They have roofs over their heads,
just like us.

207
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:53,576
I don't think anybody wants
to do anything stupid at this point.

208
00:15:53,744 --> 00:15:55,203
Why are you holding out on me?
I know you know.

209
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:56,704
Just give us the names, Web.

210
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:58,247
Who?

211
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:06,047
There are three men here in this room
that they think should be on the patrol.

212
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,050
Who?

213
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,972
If I tell you,
you can't let on that you know.

214
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:17,392
Your secret's safe, Web.
Who is it?

215
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,733
- Yeah. Heffron.
- Oh, shit!

216
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:27,527
McClung.

217
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:32,407
And you.

218
00:16:35,202 --> 00:16:37,120
He want any other guys
from any other platoon?

219
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:40,206
No. I don't know. Not that I know of.

220
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:43,084
Look, that's all I know. I'm sorry.

221
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:46,921
So it's McClung, Heffron and Ramirez?

222
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:53,553
- I'll tell them, I just need you to--
- Listen up! Got some bad news.

223
00:16:56,265 --> 00:17:00,101
There is a patrol set for tonight.
And so far Speirs wants McClung--

224
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,978
- We know.
- Yeah, we've just fucking heard.

225
00:17:02,146 --> 00:17:04,313
Webster here told us.

226
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,859
Easy White.

227
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,113
Yep. Uh-huh.

228
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:16,451
Okay. All right. Out.

229
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:21,456
The PX rations just came in.
Including winter shoepacs.

230
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,875
- Beautiful.
- Yeah, finally, right?

231
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:27,795
- Now we're in a nice, warm house.
- Also, we got showers.

232
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:32,341
All right! Let's move! Clear it out!

233
00:17:36,847 --> 00:17:38,389
Incoming!

234
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:41,517
Come on, come on,
come on, go! Get down, stay low.

235
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,615
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

236
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:57,408
Showers. Let's go.

237
00:18:07,419 --> 00:18:10,171
- Somebody's been hit!
- Where?

238
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:14,008
- What's happened?
- Casualty!

239
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,886
- Who is it?
- Bill Kiehn!

240
00:18:17,054 --> 00:18:21,516
I just left him. I was on my way back.

241
00:18:22,267 --> 00:18:25,520
<i>In war, soldiers sometimes</i>
<i>die in the fever pitch of a firefight...</i>

242
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:29,315
<i>...or by artillery when they're</i>
<i>huddled in a foxhole.</i>

243
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,567
<i>Bill Kiehn, a Toccoa man,</i>
<i>was killed because...</i>

244
00:18:31,735 --> 00:18:35,446
<i>...he was carrying a sack of potatoes</i>
<i>from one building into another.</i>

245
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:39,033
<i>In the wrong place at the wrong time.</i>

246
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:43,079
<i>He was dead before Doc Roe</i>
<i>even heard the call for a medic.</i>

247
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:45,665
Get him out of here, will you?

248
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:49,752
- Hey, let's go. Let's get out of here.
- Yeah, okay.

249
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,595
- Did you know him well?
- No, not really.

250
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:20,658
- McClung.
- Thanks.

251
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:25,371
Malarkey.

252
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:36,174
Grant, Jackson, Wynn, Liebgott,
Powers and Webster. All right?

253
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:41,012
2nd Platoon, on me!

254
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:50,271
All right, I'm leading this patrol.

255
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:56,861
C.O. wants Grant, Liebgott,
Wynn, Jackson...

256
00:19:57,029 --> 00:20:00,406
...Shifty from 3rd Platoon
and Webster.

257
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,700
- They want anyone from 1 st?
- No.

258
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:05,620
Is there anyone
they don't want from 2nd?

259
00:20:05,787 --> 00:20:08,539
That list sounds like everybody to me.

260
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,458
It's always 2nd Platoon.

261
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:13,502
I swear to God, if we were down to
three guys, they'd still want us for it.

262
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,755
I can't believe they're gonna
make Malarkey lead it.

263
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:19,091
Christ. He only lost his five best friends.
What the fuck's he got to live for?

264
00:20:19,259 --> 00:20:23,262
Has it been a long time since
your last shower, professor?

265
00:20:33,523 --> 00:20:37,068
- Come on.
- Is it hot water or cold?

266
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:43,032
- Come on. Hurry up, will you?
- All right.

267
00:20:55,879 --> 00:21:00,174
- I guess I don't really need a shower.
- I don't either.

268
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,385
- Lieutenant?
- Yeah?

269
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:05,888
- You still wanna get your ODs dirty?
- Of course.

270
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,432
I was just thinking.

271
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,770
Sgt. Malarkey's really in no condition
to be on this patrol.

272
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:16,065
Maybe if you offered,
you could go in his place.

273
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:19,694
- Being that you are an officer.
- No, they want someone with experience.

274
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:22,697
The guys they picked
have plenty of that.

275
00:21:29,705 --> 00:21:33,791
<i>Lt. Jones wanted to experience</i>
<i>combat before the war was over.</i>

276
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,543
<i>Don Malarkey had been</i>
<i>on the frontlines...</i>

277
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:39,255
<i>...every time Easy Company</i>
<i>had seen action since D-Day.</i>

278
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:42,216
<i>If it was possible for them</i>
<i>to switch places for the patrol...</i>

279
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,468
<i>...it would be</i>
<i>a small moment of justice.</i>

280
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:48,556
<i>As welcome as a hot shower</i>
<i>and a fresh uniform.</i>

281
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:52,226
<i>The decision, though,</i>
<i>was not theirs to make.</i>

282
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:57,023
Goddamn it, Johnny,
you're breaking my heart, I'm telling you.

283
00:21:57,232 --> 00:22:00,609
Come on, George.
Just give me, I don't know, 10, 15 bars.

284
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:02,069
Juicy Fruit. Happy?

285
00:22:02,237 --> 00:22:04,822
Just got a report of movement.
1 st Sgt. Lipton...

286
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,033
...wants you to lay a few bazooka rounds
into a house across the river.

287
00:22:07,242 --> 00:22:09,035
You'd think we could get
at least one Hershey bar from the...

288
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,412
Come on, Luz,
you're 1 st Platoon at heart.

289
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,914
- Jesus, Cobb, there's not enough.
- Whoa! Hershey bars!

290
00:22:14,082 --> 00:22:15,708
- Jesus Christ.
- Wait your turn, Liebgott.

291
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:17,418
- Who they for?
- Not you.

292
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:21,255
- Oh, come on, George. One bar.
- No, there's not enough to go around!

293
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:24,300
- Is Capt. Speirs here?
- Down by the river, sir.

294
00:22:24,468 --> 00:22:27,345
Hey, bigmouth,
give the kid a Hershey bar.

295
00:22:27,512 --> 00:22:29,638
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Look who it is.

296
00:22:29,806 --> 00:22:32,183
What's up, guys?
I like what you did with the place, George.

297
00:22:32,351 --> 00:22:34,602
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I did good.
How you feeling?

298
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,479
As long as you keep
your hands off my ass, I'll be fine.

299
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:37,688
Have a Hershey.

300
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,398
- Thanks.
- He gets a fucking Hershey bar?

301
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:41,150
He got shot in the ass.

302
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,194
Did I tell you to stick your big ass
out in the wind?

303
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,154
No, but I expect a little sympathy
from you, right?

304
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:47,031
- I should rub it for you?
- Get the fuck out of here.

305
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:50,451
Can you believe this guy? Try to get him out
of the fucking war, he comes straight back.

306
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,621
Yeah, well, that's not what I heard.
I heard the Krauts are finished.

307
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:57,875
Well, just to make sure, we gotta
row across the fucking river tonight...

308
00:22:58,043 --> 00:23:00,836
...grab a few, and ask them in person.

309
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:04,090
- Are you kidding me?
- Wish I was. Welcome back, Frank.

310
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:08,177
Jesus. That reminds me, Web.
I need you to run these to OP 2 for me.

311
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:12,973
Grenade launchers for the night
patrol. Any day now. There you go.

312
00:23:13,141 --> 00:23:15,309
- Hey, you know what? Send these too.
- You been working out?

313
00:23:15,477 --> 00:23:19,271
Hey, hey, hey. Hear what happened
on D Company's patrol last night?

314
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:22,316
Replacement lieutenant blew
his foot off. Stepped on a Schu-mine.

315
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:26,070
Fresh in from West Point.
Had to come back empty-handed.

316
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,572
No shit. Maybe he was
a friend of yours, lieutenant.

317
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,157
Hey, Vest, what you got there?

318
00:23:30,325 --> 00:23:33,619
More Hershey bars and Lucky Strikes
for you rear echelon fucks to hoard?

319
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,913
Hey, hey, hey,
Cobb, with the mouth, please.

320
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:39,250
The kid's just trying
to do his job, all right? Jesus Chri--

321
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:43,462
You know what, to hell with it. Count them
up, Vest. I gotta go blast this house.

322
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,548
- You happy now?
- Coming, Perco?

323
00:23:45,715 --> 00:23:48,592
Make yourself useful. Watch this shit
for me. Web, come with me.

324
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:50,845
Sergeant, is Capt. Speirs gonna be
where you're headed?

325
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:53,055
- Same vicinity, yeah.
- All right. Then I'll join you.

326
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:56,058
- Where we going?
- To the house I gotta blast.

327
00:23:56,226 --> 00:24:01,021
- Will Capt. Winters be with him?
- Jesus. Look, I don't know. Maybe.

328
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,482
- Then I'm coming too.
- All right. Come on, guys. Please.

329
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,359
I've been here all fucking day.
Give me a bar.

330
00:24:05,527 --> 00:24:06,902
I'm supposed to watch these.

331
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:10,364
Come on, you don't smoke
cigarettes, damn it. I got a wounded ass.

332
00:24:10,949 --> 00:24:13,784
Did Intelligence give
you the information on the CP?

333
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,870
Third house on the left.

334
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:18,789
As soon as our men are back in the boats,
I want a quad 50 opening up.

335
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:21,041
Captain Winters?

336
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:24,003
About the patrol. I feel that
I should go on the patrol, sir.

337
00:24:24,254 --> 00:24:26,881
I know I could use the experience.

338
00:24:27,632 --> 00:24:29,884
Denied. Anything else?

339
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:34,472
You're not gonna lead that patrol,
Lieutenant Jones.

340
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:40,686
Permission to speak, sir.

341
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,565
Go on, lieutenant.

342
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:47,109
It looks like Sergeant Malarkey
could use a break, sir.

343
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:48,527
I've discussed it with him...

344
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:52,114
...and he said that he did not mind
if I took his place on the patrol.

345
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,200
That was nice of him.

346
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,245
- Captain Winters?
- Yes.

347
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,749
I'd really like to be
on that patrol, sir.

348
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:05,044
If it's true the Krauts
are finished...

349
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:10,925
I haven't really done anything except
deliver mail and type morning reports.

350
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:15,262
- Absolutely.
- Thank you, captain.

351
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:21,727
- He's got a point about Sergeant Malarkey.
- Yeah, a point.

352
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:28,859
Fine. You can go.
There will be a briefing. CP, 1700.

353
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:30,694
Yes, sir.

354
00:25:33,073 --> 00:25:37,368
So who do you have in mind leading
this thing, if not Malarkey?

355
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:43,832
Come on, he can't be leading.

356
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,462
I'm not sure what they decided.

357
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:54,260
No way. Not on his first day.

358
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:57,805
Well, do you see any
other officer here?

359
00:26:09,693 --> 00:26:13,237
- What?
- They call you guys too?

360
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:16,365
So who's in charge of this bullshit?

361
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,326
No, he ain't.

362
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:22,830
If he ain't, it's you, Chuck.
Or Shifty or Mo.

363
00:26:23,081 --> 00:26:25,249
Well, that would be better.

364
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,502
- Ten-hut!
- Jesus.

365
00:26:28,753 --> 00:26:30,337
At ease.

366
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:35,551
- Gentlemen.
- Sir.

367
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,389
As you can see, we've assembled 15 of you
for this prisoner snatch tonight, 0100.

368
00:26:40,849 --> 00:26:45,561
Just a couple of points. We've secured
four rubber boats to get you across the river.

369
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:51,859
Lieutenant Jones here is the ranking
officer. He'll be along as an observer.

370
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:55,321
Sgt. Martin here will lead the patrol
in Sgt. Malarkey's place.

371
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:58,157
The whole battalion will be covering
your withdrawal.

372
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,993
We've identified targets,
planned fire.

373
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:02,953
We hear these whistles, we open up.

374
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:06,540
So don't blow them until you're
back in the boats with your prisoners.

375
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:08,542
And if the house turns out
to be empty, sir?

376
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:13,047
It won't, but in any case, we know it's
an outpost and want it destroyed...

377
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:15,591
...so you'll have to lay some demo
on a time delay.

378
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:19,803
Move fast, but carefully.
Put a perimeter around the house.

379
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,056
Once that's in place, get your rifle grenades
in the first-floor window...

380
00:27:22,223 --> 00:27:23,766
...get your assault team in quick.

381
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,727
Good. Understood.
Remember, it's about prisoners.

382
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,355
Don't pop the first thing that moves.

383
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:32,399
- Clear?
- Yes, sir.

384
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:34,151
Good.

385
00:27:36,488 --> 00:27:38,405
Picked your assault team?

386
00:27:38,573 --> 00:27:44,787
McClung, Sisk, Cobb, Garcia
and Webster, as translator.

387
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:49,249
The rest of you guys,
a base of fire with Sergeant Grant.

388
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:57,758
- You speak German, right, Webster?
- Yeah. A little bit.

389
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:01,345
Good. That's my team, sir.

390
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:05,224
- Questions?
- No, sir.

391
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:10,104
- Good. Good luck.
- Thank you, sir.

392
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:13,982
- Ten-hut!
- As you were. Carry on!

393
00:28:18,238 --> 00:28:20,030
A little German?

394
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:23,784
His German's as good as mine.

395
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:32,751
- Here you go. You need this.
- Thanks.

396
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:37,423
Can you believe that guy? Webster.
Tries to get out of everything.

397
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:39,425
Whatever.

398
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:45,556
- I want four men on each block.
- I was thinking about...

399
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:48,726
Four men to go in,
four on the left flank...

400
00:28:48,893 --> 00:28:51,645
- Sir? Sir?
- Yes?

401
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:55,357
- Liebgott and I, we both speak German.
- Yeah?

402
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:59,695
You said 15. There are 16 of us,
including two translators.

403
00:28:59,863 --> 00:29:03,782
Well, fine. Hey, Liebgott.
You wanna sit this one out?

404
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:04,992
Yes, sir.

405
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:09,288
- You wanna supervise 3 squads?
- Thanks, buddy.

406
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:12,499
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah.

407
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,962
You men going on patrol...

408
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,924
...nothing rattles, nothing shines,
no helmets.

409
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,309
Lieutenant?

410
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,318
Thank you.

411
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,751
You set for tonight?

412
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:59,505
- I'm ready.
- Those Krauts are gonna catch some hell.

413
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,548
So I hear.

414
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:08,096
- I'm not personally going in.
- Martin, right?

415
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:13,727
Martin and McClung. I'm supposed to
stay in the rear and give them cover.

416
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,979
It's the best place to be.

417
00:31:34,601 --> 00:31:36,476
<i>Fifteen men crossing a river...</i>

418
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:40,397
<i>...to capture prisoners</i>
<i>from a German observation post.</i>

419
00:31:40,732 --> 00:31:45,068
<i>Getting back safely could be successfully</i>
<i>accomplished in as little as 10 minutes.</i>

420
00:31:45,236 --> 00:31:48,405
<i>The same mission could be met</i>
<i>with disaster, and result in nothing more...</i>

421
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:52,618
<i>...than 15 Americans killed</i>
<i>or wounded in action.</i>

422
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:57,164
<i>Those of us who had seen combat before</i>
<i>put that out of our minds.</i>

423
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:02,753
<i>Those who hadn't probably thought of</i>
<i>little else as we waited for darkness.</i>

424
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:36,954
- Any problems?
- No problems.

425
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:40,958
It's secured to the tree.
No sign of any AP mines.

426
00:32:41,209 --> 00:32:42,793
Let's go.

427
00:32:50,718 --> 00:32:52,594
Webster, come on.

428
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:09,069
Keep it steady, keep it steady.

429
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:15,409
Oh, shit. I can't swim!

430
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:18,245
Garcia, grab Sisk.

431
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:26,795
Okay, keep going. Come on,
stay focused. Come on, come on.

432
00:33:29,924 --> 00:33:33,677
Use the rope.
Use the rope. Come on.

433
00:33:39,058 --> 00:33:40,559
Cutters.

434
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:46,523
Good.

435
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:48,692
To the side.

436
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:51,445
Let's go. Come on.

437
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,157
Clear.

438
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:59,536
Easy there. Clear.

439
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:18,972
Powers, go! Go, McClung.

440
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,730
McClung, move up.

441
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,485
In twos, up.

442
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:01,890
Powers, Wynn, secure the left flank.

443
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:06,353
Lieutenant, take Grant and Heffron, secure
the right perimeter and the crossroads.

444
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:10,649
Clear? Security out. Go. Move.

445
00:35:56,195 --> 00:35:58,405
Jackson, hold on!

446
00:35:59,282 --> 00:36:00,866
Let's go!

447
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,660
Jackson! Wait!

448
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:10,709
Put it down!

449
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:13,753
Keep your hands up
where I can see them!

450
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:17,674
Keep those Krauts quiet!

451
00:36:19,594 --> 00:36:21,136
Jackson.

452
00:36:22,096 --> 00:36:25,599
Vest, take care of him.
Ramirez, watch Vest.

453
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:29,144
Let's go, Webster, let's go!
Come on!

454
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,647
- Check them for weapons.
- Cover me!

455
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:38,278
Keep those men quiet!
McClung, cover him!

456
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,447
Prime and bury the charges!

457
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,700
Shut up, you two!
And pick him up.

458
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:47,454
McClung, these two are gonna carry
the wounded Kraut. Webster, tell them!

459
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:54,461
I said, shut up! Ramirez, pick up
Jackson. We're moving out!

460
00:36:54,629 --> 00:36:58,131
Where are you going? You move!
Everybody moves out on my command!

461
00:36:58,341 --> 00:37:00,342
Are you ready? Are you ready?

462
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:04,304
Shut up, you! Come on!
We all go together!

463
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:09,226
Let's go! Move! Move out!
Let's go! Move! Move!

464
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:13,063
Webster, come on!

465
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:21,446
Powers, fall back! We're moving out!

466
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,866
Keep those prisoners' heads down.
Keep moving!

467
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:29,329
Wynn, fall back!
We're moving out! Let's go!

468
00:37:31,457 --> 00:37:35,585
We're falling back!
Covering fire!

469
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:43,677
Heffron, I want you to fall
back now! Let's go!

470
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:49,391
Move! Get back to the boat!
I'll cover! Go!

471
00:37:49,684 --> 00:37:52,102
Keep those men moving!

472
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:03,029
Lieutenant, take the whistle!
Let's go!

473
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:07,909
- Go! Move it, Webster! Let's go!
- Move! Let's go!

474
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,245
Stay low, keep moving!

475
00:38:10,496 --> 00:38:16,042
Keep moving! Fall back
to the boats now! Fall back!

476
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:21,047
Jesus Christ, come on.
Blow the goddamn whistle!

477
00:38:36,564 --> 00:38:39,316
Okay, get into the boats!
Right now!

478
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:42,944
Get in the boats, keep moving!
Come on, move!

479
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:46,114
I'm gonna shoot you,
you fucking Kraut!

480
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:50,368
Shoot him, we'll have to come
back for more. The boat, now!

481
00:38:50,536 --> 00:38:53,371
You get up, you Kraut piece of shit!

482
00:38:56,375 --> 00:39:00,337
Into the boats!
Quick, get in the boats! Come on!

483
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:03,006
Let's go! Everyone in the boats!

484
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:07,135
Let's get these boats in the water!
Start pulling!

485
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:19,022
You're okay, Jackson!

486
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:25,487
Keep pulling!

487
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:33,411
Keep going! Come on!

488
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:36,790
Come on,
Perconte, let's go!

489
00:39:36,957 --> 00:39:40,126
- Where's the medic?
- We're almost there.

490
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,128
Get Jackson!

491
00:39:49,637 --> 00:39:52,806
Everybody off the boats!
Let's go!

492
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:58,436
Get cover!

493
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:03,066
Wounded! We got wounded,
come on!

494
00:40:03,317 --> 00:40:05,985
Get the Krauts back there,
shake them down!

495
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,487
Move! Move!

496
00:40:07,696 --> 00:40:09,072
McClung! McClung!

497
00:40:09,323 --> 00:40:13,034
Get on to the company CP,
let them know what we got.

498
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,163
Shut up!

499
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,458
I can't do this! I can't do this!

500
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:25,588
Webster, stay with him.
Hey, Shifty, watch Vest!

501
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:29,843
- I'm going to get a medic. Got this?
- Yeah.

502
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,220
Come on!

503
00:40:37,101 --> 00:40:38,351
Get his legs.

504
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:44,357
Listen to me. You have to calm down
or we can't help you. Settle down.

505
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:45,567
He's gonna die!

506
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,777
Jackson, look at me. Don't listen to him.

507
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:51,656
Look at me, you'll be fine.
Everything's gonna be okay.

508
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:58,913
Keep still. Be calm, buddy.
Everything's fine.

509
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,623
Goddamn it!

510
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:05,795
No! You'll jeopardize the battalion!
The battalion needs them.

511
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:08,715
Stay against the wall!

512
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:11,426
Watch what you're doing!

513
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:15,221
We won't get more prisoners
because you killed one!

514
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,807
- Private! Listen to me, private!
- He's gonna fucking die!

515
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,476
Hey, sit down!

516
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:21,478
Jackson, stay calm. The medic
is coming. They're on their way.

517
00:41:21,729 --> 00:41:27,108
- Where the fuck is the medic?
- The doctor's on his way.

518
00:41:27,401 --> 00:41:28,735
You'll be okay.

519
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:31,696
All right.
Doc's here. You're okay.

520
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:36,910
All right, Jackson, take it easy.
Okay. Okay. Okay.

521
00:41:37,495 --> 00:41:40,830
Light. I need some light.
Give me some light.

522
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:46,920
All right, look at the flame.
Look at the flame. Okay, that's good.

523
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,925
All right, let's get him out of here.
Let's get him out of here.

524
00:41:52,092 --> 00:41:57,013
- Help the doc move him.
- I don't wanna die!

525
00:41:57,181 --> 00:42:00,266
- It's okay.
- Let's get him out of here.

526
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:04,229
- Hey, take it easy.
- I don't wanna die, please help me.

527
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,982
Hey, it's okay. it's all right.
You're all right.

528
00:42:08,234 --> 00:42:12,111
- Jackson?
- God! Oh, my God!

529
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:16,533
Jackson, you are not gonna die.
I need you to hang on.

530
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,785
Jackson?

531
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,118
<i>Eugene Jackson was 20 years old.</i>

532
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:04,247
<i>He'd lied about his age when</i>
<i>he joined the Army at 16.</i>

533
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:08,042
<i>His family, I'm sure, got a telegram</i>
<i>from the War Department...</i>

534
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:12,964
<i>...saying he died a hero on an important</i>
<i>mission that would help win the war.</i>

535
00:43:13,132 --> 00:43:18,136
<i>In fact, Eugene lost his life on a stretcher</i>
<i>in a dank basement in Haguenau...</i>

536
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:22,599
<i>...crying out in agony while</i>
<i>his friends looked on helplessly.</i>

537
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:28,438
<i>He was just one more casualty in a war</i>
<i>that was supposed to be all but over.</i>

538
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:33,234
Did they put that
in the report on the ADA?

539
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:37,030
We're working on it.
How long are you keeping the quad 50?

540
00:43:37,197 --> 00:43:40,742
When they want it back,
I'll hand it over.

541
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:52,837
Keep moving. Go on.
Get up on the truck. Up, up.

542
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:55,173
Status?

543
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:59,761
Private Jackson took a grenade
frag rushing the enemy OP.

544
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:05,058
- It was his own grenade.
- He died of his wounds, sir.

545
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:08,978
- Any others?
- No, sir.

546
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:15,985
Well executed. It's not your fault.

547
00:44:18,572 --> 00:44:20,740
Talk to your men.

548
00:44:21,909 --> 00:44:24,702
- Carry on.
- Thanks, sir.

549
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,854
We heard you got two prisoners.

550
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,858
Good work.

551
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,153
Jackson's dead.

552
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:02,115
Yeah, we heard.

553
00:45:04,201 --> 00:45:07,495
Yeah, well, they want
another patrol tonight.

554
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:32,353
What are you doing, Cobb?

555
00:45:32,646 --> 00:45:35,648
You leave someone on the bank?

556
00:45:37,192 --> 00:45:40,027
Yeah. Yeah, we did.

557
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:44,657
It's the third prisoner that was
too far gone to bring back.

558
00:45:44,867 --> 00:45:47,785
Maybe we should put him
out of his misery.

559
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:52,540
- Fuck his misery.
- I can't listen to it anymore.

560
00:46:03,927 --> 00:46:07,013
- Sir, you want a cigarette?
- Yeah.

561
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:12,185
- Who's got a light?
- Here. Hang on, sir.

562
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:19,859
Twenty-two.

563
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:25,281
What are you looking at, Webster?

564
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:34,248
Yeah. That's what I thought,
college boy.

565
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:38,044
Are you drunk, trooper?

566
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:42,423
- Leave me alone.
- Answer the question.

567
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:46,385
Yes, sir. I am drunk, sir.

568
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:52,642
Drunk, sick and tired
of fucking patrols, taking orders--

569
00:46:52,893 --> 00:46:57,438
Hey, Cobb. Shut up.
It's boring, okay?

570
00:46:57,731 --> 00:47:00,525
Taking his side, Johnny?

571
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:06,906
Yeah, I am.

572
00:47:31,890 --> 00:47:33,683
So he knows we lost a man?

573
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:37,854
Yeah, he knows. He also knows you picked
up two prisoners who talked.

574
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:43,943
- About what?
- OB, supply trouble, Hitler's favorite color.

575
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,195
I don't know.
None of it gets us across the river.

576
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:48,489
What's the point?

577
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,869
Honestly?

578
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:58,082
Sink's been on the phone all day, bragging
it up. I think he's just showing off now.

579
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,293
I don't know what to tell you.

580
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:03,796
You gave him a successful patrol,
now he wants two.

581
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:05,423
Successful.

582
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:11,429
Sir, the men are mustered. If you
want me to brief them, I'm gonna.

583
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:15,308
It's the same roster as last night.

584
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:18,519
Well, mostly.

585
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,733
- Evening, gents.
- Evening, colonel.

586
00:48:23,942 --> 00:48:25,818
At ease.

587
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:33,743
You all did a damn fine job
on a tough mission last night.

588
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:38,331
I wish you good luck tonight, because
I'll be expecting more of the same.

589
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:41,500
- Have you briefed the men?
- Just on our way.

590
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:46,339
Make damn sure you remind them
how proud I am of what they did.

591
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:48,549
Yes, sir.

592
00:48:53,221 --> 00:48:56,057
So I'll brief them now, sir?

593
00:48:58,018 --> 00:49:02,772
No. No, I'll do it.

594
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,491
Sarge, they're on their way in.

595
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,451
Ten-hut!

596
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:21,707
- Martin.
- Sir.

597
00:49:21,959 --> 00:49:26,712
- At ease. This everybody, Grant?
- Sir.

598
00:49:30,550 --> 00:49:34,011
You men did an excellent job
last night.

599
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:37,056
I'm proud.

600
00:49:37,808 --> 00:49:40,059
I'm proud. I just saw Colonel Sink.
He's proud too.

601
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:44,230
In fact, he's so proud he wants you to do
another patrol across the river tonight.

602
00:49:48,902 --> 00:49:52,571
Any moment now, the outpost we hit
last night will go up in flames.

603
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,031
- Martin?
- Yes, sir.

604
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:56,534
Means we'd have to venture farther
into town this time.

605
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:58,619
Captain Speirs, you have the map, please.

606
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:01,330
Yeah. Sergeant Grant?

607
00:50:04,751 --> 00:50:07,795
We have enemy movement here and here.

608
00:50:08,046 --> 00:50:11,173
Which means this is our
new house target here.

609
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,800
We recovered all the boats.

610
00:50:12,968 --> 00:50:15,344
So we'll be setting off from the same place
we did last night.

611
00:50:15,512 --> 00:50:18,431
We're not changing the plan any, sir?

612
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:23,436
No. The plan is the same.

613
00:50:25,522 --> 00:50:29,483
It will be 0200 hours instead of 0100.

614
00:50:29,735 --> 00:50:32,862
- Is that clear?
- Yes, sir.

615
00:50:33,113 --> 00:50:39,618
Okay. Good. Because I want you all
to get a full night's sleep tonight.

616
00:50:41,872 --> 00:50:46,709
Which means in the morning, you will report
to me that you made it across the river...

617
00:50:46,960 --> 00:50:49,295
...into German lines...

618
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:54,091
...but were unable
to secure any live prisoners.

619
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:04,518
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.

620
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:09,690
Good.

621
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:15,154
Look sharp for tomorrow.
We're moving off the line.

622
00:51:17,115 --> 00:51:19,450
Did I fucking hear that right?

623
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:24,538
Moving off the line!

624
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:36,634
It's a whole new way to fight a war.

625
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:41,472
Don't bother writing this up.
I'll take care of it. I might actually enjoy it.

626
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:44,350
I think you might be onto something--

627
00:51:46,561 --> 00:51:48,312
Lieutenant Jones.

628
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:50,815
- Sir.
- Join us at the company CP.

629
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:04,870
- First Sergeant Lipton?
- Sir.

630
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:07,998
Your honorable discharge
as an enlisted man...

631
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:09,583
Just keep them coming, Luz.

632
00:52:09,751 --> 00:52:11,710
...and your battlefield commission
as a second lieutenant.

633
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:14,046
- What do we have here, boys?
- Hey, pal.

634
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,132
- Congratulations, Carwood.
- Thank you, sir.

635
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:19,593
- Lip, congratulations.
- Thanks.

636
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:22,847
Thank you. Welcome back, sir.

637
00:52:23,056 --> 00:52:27,560
- Hey, that's Harry to you. Congratulations.
- Harry, I didn't expect you this soon.

638
00:52:27,769 --> 00:52:30,271
I figured you'd be nursing that scratch
for another month or two.

639
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:32,940
Did you miss me, Lewis?

640
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:38,612
Lt. Jones. Regiment has seen fit
to promote you to first lieutenant.

641
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:41,282
They want you on staff up there.

642
00:52:41,491 --> 00:52:43,576
Don't go far with that.

643
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:51,917
- Congratulations and good luck.
- Thank you, sir.

644
00:52:53,128 --> 00:52:55,462
Dismissed.

645
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:59,633
I guess you lost
another platoon leader, huh, Web?

646
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:07,349
<i>So a second patrol never happened.</i>

647
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:12,396
<i>Word was Captain Nixon wrote up</i>
<i>a bogus report, and Regiment never got wise.</i>

648
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:15,441
<i>As we pulled out of Haguenau,</i>
<i>many of us in Easy Company...</i>

649
00:53:15,609 --> 00:53:21,614
<i>...felt that a corner had been turned</i>
<i>and we all might make it home alive.</i>

650
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:24,283
We'll know more
as soon as we get closer to the line.

651
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:31,123
Oh, before I forget. Col. Sink's a bit unhappy
with the appearance of your uniform.

652
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:34,668
He says it's not befitting
to your rank.

653
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:43,010
Oak leaves.

654
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,972
Congratulations, major.

655
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,143
Gentlemen, we're ready.

656
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:01,987
I'll drive.

657
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:05,324
- Sergeant Malarkey.
- Good luck, sir.

658
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:11,622
- Sergeant Martin.
- Yeah, lieutenant?

659
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:14,750
- Good work.
- Thanks, sir. Good to have you along.

660
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:42,027
Here.

661
00:54:57,210 --> 00:54:58,961
<i>I wondered if people back home...</i>

662
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:02,214
<i>...would ever know what it cost</i>
<i>the soldiers to win this war.</i>

663
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:05,843
<i>In America, things were</i>
<i>already beginning to look like peacetime.</i>

664
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:10,347
<i>The standard of living was on the rise,</i>
<i>racetracks and nightclubs were booming.</i>

665
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:14,977
<i>You couldn't get a hotel room</i>
<i>in Miami Beach, it was so crowded.</i>

666
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,857
<i>How could anyone ever know</i>
<i>of the price paid by soldiers...</i>

667
00:55:20,025 --> 00:55:22,026
<i>...in terror, agony and bloodshed...</i>

668
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:28,073
<i>...if they'd never been to places like</i>
<i>Normandy, Bastogne or Haguenau?</i>
