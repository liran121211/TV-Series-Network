1
00:00:08,226 --> 00:00:15,191
I've seen death. I've seen my friends,
my men, being killed.

2
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,823
And this is-- it doesn't take
too many days of that...

3
00:00:22,032 --> 00:00:25,285
...and you change dramatically.

4
00:00:25,535 --> 00:00:29,289
We had no food, didn't have
ammunition. it was cold.

5
00:00:29,539 --> 00:00:34,586
We didn't have clothes. if you built
a fire, something would shoot at you.

6
00:00:34,836 --> 00:00:38,340
Everywhere you look,
you would see dead people.

7
00:00:38,548 --> 00:00:41,676
A dead soldier there, here.
Ours, theirs.

8
00:00:41,885 --> 00:00:46,973
Then civilians, besides...
Dead animals.

9
00:00:47,223 --> 00:00:49,517
So death was all over.

10
00:00:49,768 --> 00:00:55,065
You don't have a chance,
when your friends go down...

11
00:00:55,273 --> 00:00:59,903
...to really take care of them
as you might.

12
00:01:00,153 --> 00:01:06,284
And especially if you're under attack,
moving or whatever, and...

13
00:01:07,535 --> 00:01:10,914
I withstood it well...

14
00:01:11,164 --> 00:01:16,711
...but I had a lot of trouble
in later life...

15
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,717
...because those events
would come back...

16
00:01:22,926 --> 00:01:26,304
...and you never forget them.

17
00:04:10,093 --> 00:04:11,678
After Bastogne...

18
00:04:11,886 --> 00:04:16,308
...Easy Company was called
to push the Germans through the Bulge.

19
00:04:16,558 --> 00:04:19,811
We were here this morning.
We came this way.

20
00:04:20,061 --> 00:04:23,398
Here's the logging road
coming into here.

21
00:04:23,565 --> 00:04:26,109
- So you go right there.
- Take it easy!

22
00:04:26,359 --> 00:04:30,613
- Stop crying or I'll nail it to your head.
- It's made of wood.

23
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:34,492
- Move them out.
- Yes, sir. 2nd Platoon, let's go.

24
00:04:34,743 --> 00:04:40,081
I was glad to be out of my foxhole
and moving, even if only to get warm.

25
00:04:40,332 --> 00:04:44,002
Spread out. Keep your interval.

26
00:04:50,216 --> 00:04:54,429
E Company was sent to clear
the woods near the town of Foy...

27
00:04:54,679 --> 00:04:59,434
...in preparation for what we knew
would be the assault on Foy itself.

28
00:04:59,601 --> 00:05:00,727
I see it, Buck.

29
00:05:00,894 --> 00:05:03,605
Watch for mines.

30
00:05:05,398 --> 00:05:10,403
During that 1000-yard attack, we
encountered sporadic machine-gun fire...

31
00:05:10,570 --> 00:05:15,492
...and had a couple casualties,
but overall met little resistance.

32
00:05:18,662 --> 00:05:22,749
Nelson! Look. Nelson!

33
00:05:24,209 --> 00:05:30,048
Hoobler's run-in with the German was
the most dramatic moment of the day.

34
00:05:38,223 --> 00:05:39,349
Halt!

35
00:05:41,434 --> 00:05:43,395
Halt!

36
00:06:07,085 --> 00:06:09,129
Oh, shit.

37
00:06:21,349 --> 00:06:22,976
Thank you.

38
00:06:28,356 --> 00:06:32,652
Hoobler had been talking
about getting a Luger since Normandy.

39
00:06:32,861 --> 00:06:36,197
He went from foxhole to foxhole
telling everyone.

40
00:06:36,406 --> 00:06:38,950
Down he goes like a sack of potatoes.

41
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:43,121
Outstanding accuracy on my part,
if I do say so myself.

42
00:06:43,371 --> 00:06:45,790
- Which you do.
- Which I do.

43
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:49,336
Shifty, I could've given you
a run for your money.

44
00:06:49,586 --> 00:06:53,506
No, I'm not a good shot.
Dad was an excellent shot.

45
00:06:53,757 --> 00:06:55,884
He'd shoot the wings off a fly.

46
00:06:56,134 --> 00:06:59,054
That German,
what'd you think he was doing?

47
00:06:59,304 --> 00:07:03,183
Recon. He must have figured
nobody'd hear a horse.

48
00:07:03,433 --> 00:07:06,144
He was just trying
to get out of Dodge.

49
00:07:06,394 --> 00:07:09,147
- What happened to the horse?
- Don't know.

50
00:07:09,356 --> 00:07:11,900
Probably still running.
Hope he's okay.

51
00:07:12,651 --> 00:07:15,487
- You dug in?
- Yeah, yeah.

52
00:07:15,737 --> 00:07:18,531
Just thought I'd take a walk.

53
00:07:18,782 --> 00:07:21,451
You're a good shot.
Glad you're on our side.

54
00:07:21,618 --> 00:07:23,453
Thanks, Lip.

55
00:07:23,703 --> 00:07:25,622
- Hey, Lip?
- Yeah.

56
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,709
- Thanks for the help.
- You got it, Shifty.

57
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:34,589
- Hey, Lip? You got a sec?
- Yes, sir.

58
00:07:36,758 --> 00:07:39,052
Give him a hand.

59
00:07:40,261 --> 00:07:43,181
- Where's Dike?
- He's around.

60
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:47,310
- Could you be more specific, sergeant?
- Not really, sir.

61
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,607
I haven't seen him all day and I have
to figure out how we ended up.

62
00:07:52,857 --> 00:07:55,443
- Two wounded.
- Who?

63
00:07:55,694 --> 00:07:59,656
- Brown and Stevenson.
- Goddamn it. Where's Dike?

64
00:07:59,906 --> 00:08:01,741
Where does he go?

65
00:08:01,992 --> 00:08:05,662
I don't know,
but I wish he'd stay there.

66
00:08:05,912 --> 00:08:09,165
- Shut up, boys.
- Shutting up, sarge.

67
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:11,501
What the hell was that?

68
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:17,007
- Patrol?
- No, we would've heard.

69
00:08:17,257 --> 00:08:20,302
- One man, maybe a sniper.
- That was no rifle.

70
00:08:20,552 --> 00:08:23,596
- What do you see, Shift?
- Nobody out there.

71
00:08:23,847 --> 00:08:25,682
- Are you sure?
- Uh-huh.

72
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,601
- It's Hoob. He's shot!
- Sniper?

73
00:08:28,852 --> 00:08:33,273
- No, no, he, he shot himself.
- Medic!

74
00:08:33,523 --> 00:08:35,275
- What happened?
- Doc.

75
00:08:35,525 --> 00:08:36,943
It's my fucking leg.

76
00:08:37,152 --> 00:08:40,905
- You'll be all right.
- It just went off.

77
00:08:41,156 --> 00:08:46,536
What are you doing with a loaded gun
in your pants? Damn it! Goddamn it!

78
00:08:46,703 --> 00:08:48,747
- I wasn't touching it.
- Medic!

79
00:08:48,997 --> 00:08:52,667
- Where are you hit?
- In my leg.

80
00:08:52,834 --> 00:08:57,380
- Take it easy, buddy.
- Don't look, Hoob. it'll be fine.

81
00:08:57,589 --> 00:09:01,009
- Hurts like a son of a bitch.
- It's gonna be okay.

82
00:09:01,259 --> 00:09:04,179
- Doc!
- Don't worry about it, Hoob.

83
00:09:04,346 --> 00:09:08,266
- You'll be all right. You hear me?
- Warm him up!

84
00:09:08,516 --> 00:09:09,976
Keep him warm.

85
00:09:10,226 --> 00:09:14,272
- How's it looking, doc?
- Let me see it.

86
00:09:14,522 --> 00:09:18,485
Can we get him some blankets
or something?

87
00:09:18,735 --> 00:09:21,905
- Keep talking to him.
- Listen to me, it's okay.

88
00:09:22,113 --> 00:09:24,282
Think it was a German leg?

89
00:09:24,491 --> 00:09:27,869
- It's not that bad.
- You're gonna be fine.

90
00:09:28,119 --> 00:09:30,955
Hold on. Put this across him.

91
00:09:31,164 --> 00:09:35,585
- Wrap him up. Wrap him up.
- Here you go. Here you go.

92
00:09:35,835 --> 00:09:41,800
- Lip, you said I was a great shot?
- You are. You're a great shot.

93
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:45,178
You jump out of planes.
You're tough, man.

94
00:09:45,428 --> 00:09:48,181
- It's not that bad.
- Stay with us, Hoob.

95
00:09:48,431 --> 00:09:51,434
- It's all right.
- Doc, what are we gonna do?

96
00:09:51,685 --> 00:09:55,146
- How we doing, doc?
- I can't see a thing.

97
00:09:55,397 --> 00:10:01,444
- Let's get ready to move him.
- Relax, take it easy. Take it easy.

98
00:10:01,695 --> 00:10:04,197
Doc. Doc!

99
00:10:16,459 --> 00:10:18,545
Perc, I'll need a jeep.

100
00:10:24,342 --> 00:10:29,431
He was wearing so many clothes we
couldn't tell how bad he was bleeding.

101
00:10:29,597 --> 00:10:34,853
He was already dead. The bullet
cut the main artery in his leg.

102
00:10:35,103 --> 00:10:39,566
It wouldn't have made a difference
if you had known.

103
00:10:39,774 --> 00:10:43,194
Cut that main artery
in the leg, that's it.

104
00:10:43,445 --> 00:10:50,076
Yes, sir. I'm gonna go back and make
sure the boys are all dug in, sir.

105
00:10:50,327 --> 00:10:55,915
- Lip? Where's Dike?
- You want to see him, sir?

106
00:10:56,166 --> 00:11:00,420
No, I just would have expected
this kind of news from him.

107
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:05,467
Well, I was there, sir.
Figured it might as well be me.

108
00:11:17,729 --> 00:11:22,275
Where's Dike? I probably heard
that question a thousand times...

109
00:11:22,484 --> 00:11:25,445
...and I probably asked it
a few times myself.

110
00:11:25,695 --> 00:11:30,742
There were long stretches where we
didn't know where Lieutenant Dike was.

111
00:11:30,909 --> 00:11:33,161
He'd disappear for hours.

112
00:11:33,411 --> 00:11:37,082
It wouldn't have been bad
if he was one of the guys...

113
00:11:37,248 --> 00:11:41,211
...but he was supposed to be
leading the company.

114
00:11:41,586 --> 00:11:45,340
Captain Winters was a CO
we could all respect.

115
00:11:45,507 --> 00:11:48,593
Moose Heyliger would have done
a good job...

116
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:52,430
...but he was accidentally shot
by a sentry.

117
00:11:52,597 --> 00:11:54,474
Then came Norman Dike.

118
00:11:54,724 --> 00:11:58,520
I want security around the company CP.

119
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:02,023
Dike wasn't bad
because he made bad decisions...

120
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:05,276
...he was bad
because he made no decisions.

121
00:12:05,485 --> 00:12:09,239
Battalion S3 is planning a move...

122
00:12:09,406 --> 00:12:13,410
...so I will probably
be called away regularly.

123
00:12:13,618 --> 00:12:15,161
Any questions?

124
00:12:15,412 --> 00:12:20,750
Yeah. What's the formation
you're wanting us to go for?

125
00:12:21,501 --> 00:12:27,090
At present, as per usual, but I'll
clarify that with you at a later time.

126
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,259
Yes, sir.

127
00:12:31,845 --> 00:12:34,681
I gotta make a call.

128
00:12:42,063 --> 00:12:45,108
- Let's move it out.
- Right.

129
00:12:48,611 --> 00:12:51,573
Dike was a favorite
of somebody at Division.

130
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,285
He'd been sent down
to get combat experience.

131
00:12:55,452 --> 00:12:58,872
It seemed like E Company
was an annoyance to him.

132
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:03,877
Something he had to get through
before he could continue up the ladder.

133
00:13:04,127 --> 00:13:08,173
- We're screwed.
- I'm glad Dike's never around.

134
00:13:08,423 --> 00:13:13,094
You know what? We're doing all right,
even with Foxhole Norman.

135
00:13:13,345 --> 00:13:16,848
We're doing all right now.
In case you ain't noticed...

136
00:13:17,098 --> 00:13:21,394
...there's a town over there, right?
In that town are Germans.

137
00:13:21,603 --> 00:13:23,897
- These Germans got tanks.
- I know.

138
00:13:24,064 --> 00:13:27,150
And our side's gonna want
to go into that town.

139
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,071
Guess who they're gonna want
to go knock on the door?

140
00:13:31,321 --> 00:13:34,866
I know, all right? it's me you're
talking to here.

141
00:13:35,116 --> 00:13:40,789
We gotta do all this with a CO
who's got his head so far up his ass...

142
00:13:40,997 --> 00:13:44,376
...that lump in his throat
is his goddamn nose.

143
00:13:44,626 --> 00:13:47,462
- Hey, first sergeant.
- Hey, boys.

144
00:13:47,712 --> 00:13:50,840
- Hey, Lip.
- Hey, Muck, what's the word?

145
00:13:51,091 --> 00:13:57,389
Sitting around freezing our ass off,
singing Dike's praises.

146
00:13:57,639 --> 00:14:01,267
Oh, yeah. Lieutenant Dike.

147
00:14:02,477 --> 00:14:06,231
Well, I'll tell you...

148
00:14:06,439 --> 00:14:09,818
...I wouldn't want to be
a replacement officer here.

149
00:14:10,068 --> 00:14:15,448
Get thrown in with guys who've
known each other for what, two years?

150
00:14:16,324 --> 00:14:19,577
You've been in combat together
since Normandy.

151
00:14:19,828 --> 00:14:25,834
He's supposed to just show up
and lead them? How does a guy do that?

152
00:14:26,084 --> 00:14:31,047
How could anyone really hope
to gain respect of the toughest...

153
00:14:31,256 --> 00:14:37,512
...most professional, most dedicated
sons of bitches in the entire ETO?

154
00:14:37,721 --> 00:14:42,475
If you ask me, a guy'd have
to march off to Berlin...

155
00:14:42,684 --> 00:14:47,188
...and come back
with Hitler's mustache or something.

156
00:14:49,941 --> 00:14:55,488
Anyway, listen. You guys don't worry
about Dike. All right?

157
00:14:55,739 --> 00:14:57,115
Yeah.

158
00:14:57,324 --> 00:15:01,077
We all do our jobs,
everything'll be fine.

159
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:07,876
- See you, sarge.
- Yeah, boy.

160
00:15:08,877 --> 00:15:13,673
I don't know if I believed that,
but as first sergeant, it was my job.

161
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,470
Not to protect Dike, but to protect
the integrity of the company.

162
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:21,765
You know what Dike's problem is,
don't you?

163
00:15:21,931 --> 00:15:24,893
He's another arrogant, rich jerk
from Yale.

164
00:15:25,143 --> 00:15:28,813
Oh, God, not another one of those.

165
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:35,862
Division wouldn't let me replace him
just because I got a bad feeling.

166
00:15:36,029 --> 00:15:39,449
Even if they would,
who'd I put in his place?

167
00:15:40,408 --> 00:15:41,451
Shames?

168
00:15:41,701 --> 00:15:43,620
Do not talk when I'm talking!

169
00:15:43,828 --> 00:15:46,665
Shames has seen too many war movies.

170
00:15:46,915 --> 00:15:50,961
You crapheads did not listen
to a word I said, did you?

171
00:15:52,045 --> 00:15:53,088
Or Peacock?

172
00:15:53,338 --> 00:15:57,717
He tries hard, but he's not cut out
to take men into combat.

173
00:15:57,884 --> 00:16:02,931
I'm not making him Company CO when
I don't want him as a platoon leader.

174
00:16:03,181 --> 00:16:07,477
- What about Compton?
- He's the only real choice.

175
00:16:08,603 --> 00:16:11,773
Buck's a real combat leader,
but you know...

176
00:16:13,191 --> 00:16:17,487
...I want Easy to have
at least one experienced platoon leader.

177
00:16:17,654 --> 00:16:21,741
Not that it matters anyway,
because I can't get rid of Dike.

178
00:16:23,702 --> 00:16:27,831
We all know who you'd like
to have running Easy.

179
00:16:28,081 --> 00:16:31,251
Trouble is,
it's not your job anymore, Dick.

180
00:16:31,501 --> 00:16:34,796
You've gotta find somebody.

181
00:16:41,219 --> 00:16:44,431
We agreed Buck would've been
the best choice...

182
00:16:44,597 --> 00:16:47,934
...if Winters had been able to
get rid of Dike.

183
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,982
But Buck wasn't the same
as before he got shot in Holland.

184
00:16:54,149 --> 00:16:55,734
He was more serious.

185
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:59,112
- He had a Luger in his pants.
- Jesus.

186
00:16:59,362 --> 00:17:03,616
Don't you two do something
stupid like that, all right?

187
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:06,828
- We'll try not to, Buck.
- I mean it.

188
00:17:07,037 --> 00:17:09,748
And you, Wild Bill.

189
00:17:09,956 --> 00:17:15,503
I've invested too much goddamn time
shaping you into something useful.

190
00:17:15,754 --> 00:17:20,091
- You do something crazy--
- I know, you'll kill me.

191
00:17:20,342 --> 00:17:23,511
Even if you're dead,
I'll still kill you.

192
00:17:24,429 --> 00:17:28,308
I'll see you later.
I'm gonna check on the other guys.

193
00:17:32,979 --> 00:17:36,650
- Crazy Joe McCloskey.
- What?

194
00:17:36,858 --> 00:17:41,071
This guy used to hang out at Delancey's
and stare at people.

195
00:17:41,321 --> 00:17:46,993
I know who Crazy Joe is.
What's that got to do with anything?

196
00:17:47,243 --> 00:17:49,704
Buck kind of reminds me of him now.

197
00:17:50,622 --> 00:17:55,001
- What?
- Ever since he got shot in Holland.

198
00:17:55,168 --> 00:18:00,966
Wait. What are you saying, he's nuts?
Because Crazy Joe was nuts.

199
00:18:01,132 --> 00:18:04,177
I'm not saying he's nuts.
I'm just saying...

200
00:18:04,344 --> 00:18:06,554
What? What are you saying?

201
00:18:06,805 --> 00:18:08,390
- Forget it.
- What?

202
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,685
Forget it.
Come on, you've seen him, Bill.

203
00:18:11,893 --> 00:18:17,107
- He's all wound up like a spring.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's fine.

204
00:18:19,651 --> 00:18:23,863
It wasn't getting shot that got him,
it was that hospital.

205
00:18:24,114 --> 00:18:29,411
- I've been there, okay? it ain't pretty.
- Yeah.

206
00:18:29,619 --> 00:18:33,832
Besides, once he was up and around,
he was his old self again.

207
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:38,503
I'm telling you, Buck Compton's fine.

208
00:18:40,672 --> 00:18:43,049
- I'm serious.
- Sure. Nothing stupid.

209
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:46,303
- We got it, right?
- We got it.

210
00:18:46,553 --> 00:18:48,930
All right. George?

211
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:54,019
Nothing stupid, Buck.

212
00:19:01,276 --> 00:19:03,486
Who is he talking to?

213
00:19:03,653 --> 00:19:09,034
Morons who volunteered to jump out of a
good airplane. Can you get more stupid?

214
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,453
- Probably not.
- Right.

215
00:19:11,703 --> 00:19:15,332
- I swum across the Niagara once.
- Yeah.

216
00:19:17,250 --> 00:19:22,213
- I swear. On a bet.
- What, in a barrel?

217
00:19:22,464 --> 00:19:26,426
No. I didn't go over the falls.
I swam across the river.

218
00:19:26,676 --> 00:19:29,262
- I don't know.
- Ten miles up.

219
00:19:29,512 --> 00:19:31,973
- That current is damn strong.
- Yeah.

220
00:19:32,182 --> 00:19:37,020
Must have carried me two miles
downstream, but I got across.

221
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:41,191
Now, personally, I didn't think
it was all that stupid...

222
00:19:41,441 --> 00:19:45,987
...but my mom, my sister Ruth,
they gave me all kinds of hell.

223
00:19:46,237 --> 00:19:49,324
- Yeah, I bet, Muck.
- So did Faye.

224
00:19:49,574 --> 00:19:53,078
- Sweet Faye Tanner.
- Shut it, George.

225
00:19:53,328 --> 00:19:56,956
They had a point. You're an idiot.

226
00:20:16,851 --> 00:20:21,272
I heard about Hoobler. Shame.

227
00:20:21,898 --> 00:20:25,151
Yes, sir. it is.

228
00:20:26,361 --> 00:20:28,905
- Is that the Luger?
- Yes, it is.

229
00:20:29,155 --> 00:20:33,368
- What are you gonna do with it?
- I don't know yet.

230
00:20:34,911 --> 00:20:40,792
- Where you from? Where'd you grow up?
- Huntington, West Virginia.

231
00:20:41,001 --> 00:20:43,628
- Huntington?
- Yes, sir.

232
00:20:43,878 --> 00:20:46,548
I don't know it.

233
00:20:46,798 --> 00:20:50,051
What kind of work did you do there?

234
00:20:50,302 --> 00:20:54,014
My brother and I helped my mom
run a boarding house.

235
00:20:54,264 --> 00:20:56,433
And your father?

236
00:20:58,893 --> 00:21:05,275
He was killed when I was 10, sir.
Automobile accident.

237
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:08,653
That's sad.

238
00:21:13,908 --> 00:21:16,453
Why'd you decide
to join the paratroopers?

239
00:21:16,703 --> 00:21:20,415
I read an article about paratroopers
in Life.

240
00:21:20,623 --> 00:21:23,752
Talked about the training,
how hard it was.

241
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:28,340
It said if you wanted to make it,
you had to be the best.

242
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:31,301
And I wanted to fight
with the best, sir.

243
00:21:31,551 --> 00:21:33,970
You miss it?

244
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:37,015
- Miss what?
- Huntington.

245
00:21:40,101 --> 00:21:45,023
Honestly, sir, I try not to think
about it that much.

246
00:21:47,692 --> 00:21:49,611
Where are you from, s--?

247
00:22:09,255 --> 00:22:13,426
- Captain Nixon, sir? Captain Nixon?
- What?

248
00:22:14,219 --> 00:22:17,973
Sorry to disturb you.
This came from Division.

249
00:22:21,142 --> 00:22:22,519
All right.

250
00:22:26,398 --> 00:22:29,359
- Morning.
- Eviction notice?

251
00:22:29,609 --> 00:22:33,029
Something that'll help
your leadership problem.

252
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:36,574
- Dike's transferred?
- I can't help with that.

253
00:22:36,825 --> 00:22:40,996
Division has decided to pluck
one officer from each regiment...

254
00:22:41,246 --> 00:22:45,917
...that served in Bastogne, send him
to the States on a 30-day furlough...

255
00:22:46,126 --> 00:22:49,546
...get him banging the drum
for the war bond drive.

256
00:22:49,796 --> 00:22:52,590
Turns out I've been plucked.

257
00:22:55,135 --> 00:22:58,888
- That's fantastic, Lew. Good for you.
- Thank you.

258
00:22:59,139 --> 00:23:01,975
- How does your leaving help?
- I'm not going.

259
00:23:02,225 --> 00:23:05,854
I've seen the States.
That's why I came to Europe.

260
00:23:06,104 --> 00:23:11,067
Wish they'd told me there was a war.
Anyway, this thing's wasted on me.

261
00:23:11,234 --> 00:23:15,822
But I'm sure we could find an officer
who could use a trip home.

262
00:23:17,073 --> 00:23:20,994
Peacock, I can't think of anybody
who deserves this more.

263
00:23:21,244 --> 00:23:22,829
Thanks.

264
00:23:24,164 --> 00:23:28,877
- Really glad that you're going home.
- Best news I've heard in weeks.

265
00:23:29,127 --> 00:23:30,545
Hell of a guy.

266
00:23:30,754 --> 00:23:33,965
Thanks, guys.
It really means a lot, you know?

267
00:23:34,215 --> 00:23:37,844
Get out of here.
Three cheers for Lt. Peacock.

268
00:23:38,094 --> 00:23:42,307
Hip, hip, hooray. Hip, hip, hooray.
Hip, hip, hooray.

269
00:23:55,236 --> 00:23:57,864
If they come here,
smile for the camera.

270
00:23:58,114 --> 00:24:00,992
Got to keep morale up
for folks back home.

271
00:24:01,201 --> 00:24:04,954
- Why?
- Damned if I know.

272
00:24:05,163 --> 00:24:07,707
What's waiting for us in Foy?

273
00:24:07,958 --> 00:24:11,836
At least one company
from the 10th Panzer Grenadiers.

274
00:24:12,087 --> 00:24:16,466
They've got one 88, although
we haven't been able to spot it.

275
00:24:16,716 --> 00:24:19,636
- Armor?
- As of last night, three Tigers.

276
00:24:19,886 --> 00:24:22,681
- Would you excuse me a moment, sir?
- Yeah.

277
00:24:22,889 --> 00:24:26,101
How do I feel
about being rescued by Patton?

278
00:24:26,351 --> 00:24:30,105
Well, I'd feel peachy
if it wasn't for one thing.

279
00:24:30,313 --> 00:24:34,609
We didn't need to be fucking rescued
by Patton. You got that?

280
00:24:34,859 --> 00:24:36,027
- Joe.
- Sir.

281
00:24:36,194 --> 00:24:38,238
Excuse us for a moment.

282
00:24:38,488 --> 00:24:39,572
Sorry, sir.

283
00:24:39,781 --> 00:24:43,827
Sorry about what? Patton?
I couldn't agree more.

284
00:24:44,077 --> 00:24:47,372
- What are you doing?
- I want to head back.

285
00:24:47,622 --> 00:24:51,501
You don't have to.
Get back to the aid station.

286
00:24:51,668 --> 00:24:55,213
I'd really like to head back
with the fellas, sir.

287
00:24:57,382 --> 00:25:02,095
- All right, then go.
- Thank you, sir.

288
00:25:06,266 --> 00:25:09,602
Joe had been at the aid station
for three days...

289
00:25:09,811 --> 00:25:14,190
...and everybody was glad
to have him back. Especially Bill.

290
00:25:14,399 --> 00:25:15,859
- Hey, Joe.
- Hey, Bill.

291
00:25:16,067 --> 00:25:20,655
- What you doing back here?
- Making sure you're on top of things.

292
00:25:20,905 --> 00:25:26,369
I'm on top of things. Tied me own boots
once last week. All by meself.

293
00:25:26,536 --> 00:25:30,874
- Look who I found.
- Joe Toye, back for more.

294
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:32,334
How are you, Joe?

295
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:36,463
- Good. Escaped from the aid station.
- Where'd you get hit?

296
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:39,466
- What's that?
- It's Webb. Replacement.

297
00:25:39,716 --> 00:25:44,054
Thought it was some guy I've known
for years and forgot.

298
00:25:44,304 --> 00:25:48,058
Joe got hit in the arm.
Gift from the Luftwaffe.

299
00:25:48,308 --> 00:25:51,519
- Lot of you been injured?
- It's called wounded.

300
00:25:51,728 --> 00:25:54,314
Injured is when you fall out
of a tree.

301
00:25:54,564 --> 00:25:58,818
There's enough crap flying around,
you're bound to get dinged.

302
00:25:59,027 --> 00:26:02,656
Almost every one of these guys
have been hit once.

303
00:26:02,906 --> 00:26:07,369
Except Alley. He's a two-timer.
He landed on broken glass...

304
00:26:07,577 --> 00:26:10,330
...and got peppered
by a potato masher.

305
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:14,042
Bull got a piece
of exploding tank in Holland.

306
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:18,880
And George Luz here has never been hit.
You're one lucky bastard.

307
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:22,592
- Takes one to know one.
- Consider us blessed.

308
00:26:22,801 --> 00:26:26,805
Liebgott got pinked
in the neck in Holland.

309
00:26:27,055 --> 00:26:29,683
Next to him, that's Popeye.

310
00:26:29,891 --> 00:26:33,770
He got shot in his scrawny
little butt in Normandy.

311
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:37,649
Buck got shot in his rather large butt
in Holland.

312
00:26:37,899 --> 00:26:41,778
Easy Company tradition,
getting shot in the ass.

313
00:26:41,987 --> 00:26:47,409
Even 1st Sgt. Lipton, he got
a couple pieces of tank shell burst.

314
00:26:47,659 --> 00:26:52,288
One chunk in the face.
Another chunk almost took out his nuts.

315
00:26:52,539 --> 00:26:59,421
- How are those nuts, sarge?
- Doing fine, Bill. Nice of you to ask.

316
00:27:01,423 --> 00:27:07,345
On January 3rd, most of E Company
headed to our old position in the woods.

317
00:27:07,595 --> 00:27:12,517
A few men remained attached
to D Company to hold the line.

318
00:27:13,143 --> 00:27:15,186
Good luck, ladies.

319
00:27:16,313 --> 00:27:18,148
Been nice knowing you.

320
00:27:19,149 --> 00:27:23,570
- Wouldn't drink if I were you.
- Be careful if he offers a cigarette.

321
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,989
If who offers us a cigarette?

322
00:27:26,197 --> 00:27:27,907
- Speirs.
- Who?

323
00:27:28,158 --> 00:27:30,660
Lieutenant Speirs.

324
00:27:32,495 --> 00:27:37,792
Lieutenant Ronald Speirs was one of the
platoon leaders. He was a legend.

325
00:27:38,668 --> 00:27:43,882
- The stories are all bullshit anyway.
- What stories?

326
00:27:44,049 --> 00:27:45,383
What stories?

327
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:49,220
Supposedly Speirs shot one
of his men for being drunk.

328
00:27:49,387 --> 00:27:52,682
You're kidding! That's unbelievable.

329
00:27:52,891 --> 00:27:57,395
There's another one about him
giving cigarettes to 20 POWs...

330
00:27:57,646 --> 00:28:01,232
- ...before killing them.
- He shot 20 POWs?

331
00:28:01,441 --> 00:28:03,526
I heard it was 30.

332
00:28:03,735 --> 00:28:06,738
- Christenson.
- Lieutenant Speirs.

333
00:28:06,988 --> 00:28:10,367
- I got the name right, didn't I?
- Yes, sir.

334
00:28:11,826 --> 00:28:16,665
- What are you men doing out here?
- We're watching the line, sir.

335
00:28:18,333 --> 00:28:21,127
You might want
to reinforce your cover.

336
00:28:21,378 --> 00:28:23,546
Lieutenant Dike said not to.

337
00:28:23,797 --> 00:28:28,551
- That we're only gonna be here one day.
- Lieutenant Dike said that?

338
00:28:28,802 --> 00:28:31,805
Then forget what I said.

339
00:28:33,264 --> 00:28:34,808
Carry on.

340
00:28:38,228 --> 00:28:41,272
Anyone care for a smoke?

341
00:28:45,318 --> 00:28:47,445
You?

342
00:28:48,863 --> 00:28:51,700
Late in the afternoon
on January 3rd...

343
00:28:51,866 --> 00:28:55,286
...we returned
to our old position in the woods.

344
00:28:55,453 --> 00:28:58,707
You gotta be fucking kidding me!

345
00:28:58,957 --> 00:29:01,876
Someone's gonna fucking die.

346
00:29:02,043 --> 00:29:07,090
Look at this shit! Those 1st Battalion
fuckers took a dump in my foxhole.

347
00:29:07,257 --> 00:29:10,677
Think they shit
in everyone's foxhole, Joe.

348
00:29:12,012 --> 00:29:15,890
I don't think they wanted
to spend much time above ground.

349
00:29:17,767 --> 00:29:21,146
The Germans had been shelling
our old position.

350
00:29:21,396 --> 00:29:25,525
There were signs
of tree bursts everywhere.

351
00:29:25,775 --> 00:29:30,280
Light and noise discipline.
We're getting close.

352
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:42,083
Across the field,
I could see enemy troops.

353
00:29:42,334 --> 00:29:47,380
I still couldn't see their artillery,
but I knew it was down there.

354
00:29:49,507 --> 00:29:53,261
The Krauts have been
pounding this area with 88s.

355
00:29:53,511 --> 00:29:58,975
- They got this whole stretch targeted.
- Maybe they've got a new target.

356
00:29:59,225 --> 00:30:01,436
- No, they're waiting.
- For what?

357
00:30:01,686 --> 00:30:05,607
- For us to reoccupy the position.
- We should fall back.

358
00:30:05,857 --> 00:30:11,196
It's our job to hold the line here.
We just need to fortify the covers.

359
00:30:11,446 --> 00:30:17,077
- If they've got us targeted, maybe--
- We hold the line here. Lipton's right.

360
00:30:17,327 --> 00:30:20,538
We're gonna strengthen our covers
and hang in.

361
00:30:20,747 --> 00:30:25,794
We're not gonna fall back.
Right, lieutenant?

362
00:30:27,837 --> 00:30:32,676
- Right, lieutenant?
- Fine. You all take care of it.

363
00:30:32,926 --> 00:30:35,637
I gotta go talk to Regiment.

364
00:30:37,931 --> 00:30:41,059
- We better get moving.
- Yeah.

365
00:30:44,145 --> 00:30:46,189
- Here you go.
- Thanks, Lip.

366
00:30:46,439 --> 00:30:50,568
- I'll get you more branches.
- I appreciate that.

367
00:31:13,258 --> 00:31:16,678
Incoming! Take cover!

368
00:31:19,347 --> 00:31:20,724
Take cover!

369
00:31:24,811 --> 00:31:26,438
They're 88s.

370
00:31:26,688 --> 00:31:28,732
Come on, find some cover!

371
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:31,359
They've got us zeroed!

372
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:36,448
Find some cover. Find a foxhole.
Come on, take cover!

373
00:31:36,698 --> 00:31:40,744
- Get in the holes.
- Take cover!

374
00:31:44,748 --> 00:31:46,541
Come on, find some cover!

375
00:31:50,045 --> 00:31:52,088
Take cover!

376
00:31:53,298 --> 00:31:54,758
Shit.

377
00:32:03,933 --> 00:32:08,355
Come on, find some cover.
Find some cover!

378
00:32:16,112 --> 00:32:19,074
For some reason,
all I could think about...

379
00:32:19,282 --> 00:32:22,285
...was the Fourth of July
when I was a kid.

380
00:32:22,452 --> 00:32:26,998
I loved to make my own firecrackers,
cherry bombs, ladyfingers.

381
00:32:27,248 --> 00:32:32,963
I loved to blow up dirt clods and pop
bottles. Looked forward to it all year.

382
00:32:33,213 --> 00:32:39,344
That day, I saw the most awesome
display of firepower I'd ever seen.

383
00:32:39,594 --> 00:32:43,515
I wouldn't have laughed
if I'd known what happened to Joe Toye.

384
00:33:43,742 --> 00:33:47,495
- We should see if anybody's hit.
- That's what they want.

385
00:33:47,746 --> 00:33:50,957
Krauts will try to draw us
out in the open.

386
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:06,181
Stay in your foxholes.
Stay in your foxholes!

387
00:34:06,389 --> 00:34:08,975
Can you walk? Find a foxhole.

388
00:34:09,267 --> 00:34:11,436
I gotta get up.

389
00:34:14,648 --> 00:34:16,858
I gotta get up.

390
00:34:18,943 --> 00:34:21,279
I gotta get up.

391
00:34:23,573 --> 00:34:25,992
I need my helmet.

392
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:30,205
- I need help!
- You hear that?

393
00:34:30,455 --> 00:34:32,916
- I need help!
- Is that Joe?

394
00:34:34,834 --> 00:34:36,878
Yeah, I think that's Joe.

395
00:34:37,671 --> 00:34:40,215
Stay.

396
00:34:40,465 --> 00:34:45,428
- Stay down! Stay down!
- Stay down! Stay in your foxholes!

397
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:49,599
- Stay in your foxholes!
- Help!

398
00:34:49,849 --> 00:34:54,771
- Help! Anyone there?
- Jesus.

399
00:34:54,980 --> 00:35:00,026
I gotta get up. I gotta get up.

400
00:35:01,945 --> 00:35:07,951
Shit. Come on, Joe. Come on, buddy.
Come on. Come on, pal.

401
00:35:08,118 --> 00:35:11,162
You said you'd get to the
States before me.

402
00:35:11,329 --> 00:35:14,082
You ain't going anywhere.
You're okay.

403
00:35:14,332 --> 00:35:18,044
- I gotta get my helmet!
- Forget it, Joe.

404
00:35:18,295 --> 00:35:22,090
- Anyone there? Help!
- Hang on.

405
00:35:24,467 --> 00:35:26,720
- Who's that?
- Heff! Babe!

406
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:30,223
- Hang on.
- Come on, get me out of here, Lip!

407
00:35:32,017 --> 00:35:33,810
I gotta get to the hole!

408
00:35:33,977 --> 00:35:38,189
- I got you. Come on, Joe, I got you.
- I gotta get to the hole!

409
00:35:40,734 --> 00:35:42,527
Come on, Joe.

410
00:35:44,321 --> 00:35:45,864
Hang on.

411
00:35:46,239 --> 00:35:47,365
- You okay?
- Yeah.

412
00:35:47,615 --> 00:35:49,617
Come on. Come on!

413
00:35:49,784 --> 00:35:52,662
Think I overdid the
cover for my foxhole?

414
00:35:53,204 --> 00:35:57,125
- Incoming!
- Incoming!

415
00:35:58,251 --> 00:36:00,879
Take cover!

416
00:36:08,053 --> 00:36:11,139
Come on! Come on! Hurry up!

417
00:36:11,389 --> 00:36:15,060
Guarno! You're gonna get bombed!
Come on! Come on!

418
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:17,979
Move it, Bill! Move it.

419
00:36:19,105 --> 00:36:24,027
- Come on, Joe.
- Hold on, I'll be there! I'll help!

420
00:36:24,778 --> 00:36:27,364
No!

421
00:36:29,115 --> 00:36:31,117
Medic!

422
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:40,919
During the second barrage,
I wasn't laughing anymore.

423
00:37:18,081 --> 00:37:19,124
Lip!

424
00:37:22,002 --> 00:37:24,296
Are you okay?

425
00:37:27,048 --> 00:37:29,509
Stay down!

426
00:37:29,759 --> 00:37:33,513
- You stay down!
- 1st Sgt. Lipton?

427
00:37:33,763 --> 00:37:38,059
You get things organized here.
I'm gonna go for help.

428
00:37:41,271 --> 00:37:43,898
What the fuck?

429
00:37:47,944 --> 00:37:50,280
- Where is he going?
- I don't know.

430
00:37:50,447 --> 00:37:53,199
Get Battalion on the line
to notify BAS.

431
00:37:53,366 --> 00:37:55,410
Battalion's up, Lip.

432
00:38:08,381 --> 00:38:10,842
Medic!

433
00:38:19,976 --> 00:38:23,396
Stay ready! They might
be trying to come through.

434
00:38:23,563 --> 00:38:25,607
- You okay, One Lung?
- Sergeant!

435
00:38:25,774 --> 00:38:27,108
How you doing, Popeye?

436
00:38:27,275 --> 00:38:30,403
Hundred percent ready
to kill Germans, Lip!

437
00:38:40,997 --> 00:38:43,959
- Doc, what can I do?
- Hold this.

438
00:38:46,086 --> 00:38:48,254
- You got a smoke?
- Yeah.

439
00:38:49,255 --> 00:38:54,594
Jesus. What's a guy gotta do
to get killed around here?

440
00:38:54,761 --> 00:38:58,098
- Bill, you go first.
- Whatever you say, doc.

441
00:38:58,306 --> 00:39:00,684
Over here. Take this man.

442
00:39:00,934 --> 00:39:06,064
- Hey, they got old Guarnere this time.
- We got you, soldier.

443
00:39:08,817 --> 00:39:10,652
Just lie back.

444
00:39:14,489 --> 00:39:18,159
Hey, Joe, I told you I'd beat
you back to the States.

445
00:39:19,494 --> 00:39:21,079
Hey, Lip.

446
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:26,084
How's Buck?

447
00:39:27,335 --> 00:39:30,046
- Luz, how's Buck?
- He's fine.

448
00:39:30,297 --> 00:39:32,549
- You sure?
- Yes, he's fine.

449
00:39:33,049 --> 00:39:36,303
I think you should
probably go talk to him.

450
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,473
All right.

451
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:54,904
Some say Buck changed after
he was shot in Holland. Maybe.

452
00:39:55,155 --> 00:40:00,076
Something happened to him when he
saw Toye and Guarnere on the ground.

453
00:40:09,169 --> 00:40:14,132
The report said Compton was being
taken off because of bad trench foot.

454
00:40:14,299 --> 00:40:18,219
Didn't say anything about
him losing his friends.

455
00:40:24,351 --> 00:40:27,020
Buck was a great combat leader.

456
00:40:27,270 --> 00:40:30,482
He was wounded in Normandy
and again in Holland.

457
00:40:30,649 --> 00:40:34,819
He received the Silver Star
for taking out those German guns.

458
00:40:34,986 --> 00:40:38,156
He took everything
the Krauts could throw.

459
00:40:39,199 --> 00:40:41,159
Lieutenant Compton?

460
00:40:42,702 --> 00:40:47,666
"UCLA did not make the Rose Bowl,
probably because you weren't there.

461
00:40:47,916 --> 00:40:53,088
I'm sure you're teaching your young
soldiers the joy you have of the sport.

462
00:40:53,338 --> 00:40:59,094
How we all know what an exciting young
man you are, how your heart and love--"

463
00:41:02,514 --> 00:41:07,477
I guess he just couldn't take seeing
Toye and Guarnere all torn up.

464
00:41:07,727 --> 00:41:11,606
No one ever thought any
less of him for it.

465
00:41:21,241 --> 00:41:22,867
Hey, Bull.

466
00:41:23,743 --> 00:41:27,914
With Buck off the line,
there was no alternative to Dike.

467
00:41:28,081 --> 00:41:30,083
At least none we could see.

468
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:31,751
Thanks.

469
00:41:33,795 --> 00:41:35,422
Hey, Muck.

470
00:41:36,589 --> 00:41:39,843
- Muck. I'm looking for Lt. Dike.
- Yes, sergeant.

471
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:44,389
We were stuck with Dike.
And he was off taking a walk.

472
00:41:49,227 --> 00:41:52,272
Lightning Six, Kidnap.

473
00:41:52,522 --> 00:41:55,066
We've cleared all the green area...

474
00:41:55,233 --> 00:41:57,569
We'd cleared the woods
east of Foy.

475
00:41:57,736 --> 00:42:02,574
Later, E Company and the rest of the 506
cleared the woods west of Foy.

476
00:42:02,741 --> 00:42:05,035
There was little resistance.

477
00:42:05,285 --> 00:42:08,997
- We have KIA.
- Thirteen.

478
00:42:09,164 --> 00:42:12,959
You fellas know I got no reason
to bullshit you, right?

479
00:42:13,209 --> 00:42:15,128
Look, this is what I saw.

480
00:42:15,295 --> 00:42:18,632
It was so unbelievable
you might not believe me.

481
00:42:18,798 --> 00:42:22,636
You-know-who runs up.
No helmet, no gear, nothing.

482
00:42:22,802 --> 00:42:29,184
"1st Sgt. Lipton, you organize
things here, and I'm gonna go for help."

483
00:42:29,392 --> 00:42:31,645
"I need to polish my oak leaves."

484
00:42:31,811 --> 00:42:33,730
- Hey, Luz.
- Complete asshole.

485
00:42:33,897 --> 00:42:36,941
- That's really good.
- Fellas.

486
00:42:37,108 --> 00:42:40,028
- Good night, all.
- See you, Luz.

487
00:42:40,236 --> 00:42:41,613
Sarge?

488
00:42:41,780 --> 00:42:44,741
Two things.
First, great impression of Dike.

489
00:42:44,908 --> 00:42:48,161
- I thought it was off.
- You got it pretty good.

490
00:42:48,328 --> 00:42:53,458
Second, don't do it anymore, especially
the part about what he said to me.

491
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:57,045
- It doesn't do anybody any good, okay?
- I got you.

492
00:42:57,212 --> 00:42:58,588
All right.

493
00:43:01,383 --> 00:43:03,385
Wise ass.

494
00:43:09,224 --> 00:43:11,142
Incoming!

495
00:43:28,868 --> 00:43:32,789
Luz! Luz! Come on! Luz! Hurry!

496
00:43:33,039 --> 00:43:36,543
Move! Luz!

497
00:43:36,751 --> 00:43:42,424
Stay down! Stay down! Come on!
Get in here! Luz, come on!

498
00:43:42,674 --> 00:43:45,343
Luz! Come on, Luz! Come on!

499
00:43:45,593 --> 00:43:48,013
Come on! Luz!

500
00:44:17,083 --> 00:44:20,795
- Muck and Penkala!
- What?

501
00:44:21,046 --> 00:44:23,923
Muck and Penkala got hit!

502
00:44:31,848 --> 00:44:33,600
Medic!

503
00:44:37,729 --> 00:44:40,398
- Hashey!
- Shit, it's my shoulder.

504
00:44:40,649 --> 00:44:44,110
Come on! Get up! Move!

505
00:44:47,739 --> 00:44:51,409
Stay down! incoming!

506
00:45:13,098 --> 00:45:16,643
- I thought you didn't smoke.
- I don't.

507
00:45:28,029 --> 00:45:32,033
The shell that hit the foxhole
Luz and I were in was a dud.

508
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:37,706
The one that hit Muck and Penkala's
foxhole wasn't. That's the way it was.

509
00:45:37,914 --> 00:45:40,834
Muck and Penkala were good men.

510
00:45:43,253 --> 00:45:45,297
Their death hit Malarkey hard.

511
00:45:45,505 --> 00:45:48,883
His best friends were
Compton, Muck and Penkala.

512
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:52,721
In less than a week,
he'd seen two of them die.

513
00:45:54,097 --> 00:45:56,933
- The word?
- The men on the line are okay.

514
00:45:57,100 --> 00:45:58,893
Food has been resupplied.

515
00:45:59,144 --> 00:46:02,355
We'll hunker down.
We might get relief soon.

516
00:46:02,605 --> 00:46:04,816
Okay? All right.

517
00:46:25,503 --> 00:46:29,591
Later that day, we were in our
old position overlooking Foy.

518
00:46:29,758 --> 00:46:32,802
We were all worried about Malarkey.

519
00:46:33,053 --> 00:46:35,055
Hey, Malark?

520
00:46:39,184 --> 00:46:46,066
Didn't I hear you say you wanted to
bring a Luger home to your kid brother?

521
00:46:53,907 --> 00:46:58,662
Well, why don't you give him that?

522
00:47:02,540 --> 00:47:05,335
- It's Hoob's, right?
- Yeah.

523
00:47:05,585 --> 00:47:09,714
Yeah, I was gonna
get rid of it, but I...

524
00:47:09,965 --> 00:47:11,967
I don't know.

525
00:47:13,301 --> 00:47:18,640
Captain Winters was wondering if
you wanted to go back to Battalion...

526
00:47:18,890 --> 00:47:21,768
...and work as his runner
for a few days.

527
00:47:24,938 --> 00:47:28,984
Tell him thanks.
I'm gonna stay here.

528
00:47:30,402 --> 00:47:35,031
Why don't you come back for an
hour or so, say goodbye to Buck?

529
00:47:35,198 --> 00:47:37,826
I'm sure it'll mean a lot to him.

530
00:47:42,914 --> 00:47:44,082
All right.

531
00:47:47,294 --> 00:47:49,462
You be careful with that.

532
00:47:50,797 --> 00:47:53,300
Getting 50 yards back for an hour...

533
00:47:53,466 --> 00:47:57,512
...could make a big difference
in a soldier's state of mind.

534
00:48:00,807 --> 00:48:03,518
The morning after the shelling...

535
00:48:03,685 --> 00:48:07,814
...I saw a soldier try to dig a
foxhole with his bare hands.

536
00:48:07,981 --> 00:48:11,735
He didn't notice that he had
torn off his fingernails.

537
00:48:11,901 --> 00:48:16,448
I got him out of there quickly.
Not for his sake, but for ours.

538
00:48:16,698 --> 00:48:22,495
Fear is poison in combat. Something
we all felt but didn't show. You can't.

539
00:48:22,746 --> 00:48:26,416
It's destructive, and it's contagious.

540
00:48:28,168 --> 00:48:30,545
Told you I'd get you started.

541
00:48:36,885 --> 00:48:40,722
Buck was never the same after
Toye and Guarnere got hit.

542
00:48:40,889 --> 00:48:44,434
I guess he just needed
some time away from it all.

543
00:48:56,613 --> 00:49:00,158
The January 3rd barrages and
January 9th shelling...

544
00:49:00,325 --> 00:49:03,703
...marked the low point
for the men in E Company.

545
00:49:03,870 --> 00:49:06,289
Even then, very few actually broke.

546
00:49:06,456 --> 00:49:12,754
But I knew the terror and pressure
we'd been under could take their toll.

547
00:49:12,921 --> 00:49:17,217
I was afraid the men would lose focus,
suffer a drop in morale.

548
00:49:17,384 --> 00:49:20,887
And that was dangerous,
especially in combat.

549
00:49:21,054 --> 00:49:24,224
More of which lay in store for us.

550
00:49:25,642 --> 00:49:28,019
We'd cleared east and west of Foy.

551
00:49:28,186 --> 00:49:33,525
It was time for the inevitable assault
on Foy itself. I was dreading it.

552
00:49:33,692 --> 00:49:37,862
The men who trained at Toccoa
wouldn't get through unscathed.

553
00:49:38,029 --> 00:49:42,659
I was beginning to wonder if any
of us would make it through at all.

554
00:49:42,826 --> 00:49:47,122
We would lead the attacks.
The problem was, in my estimation...

555
00:49:47,289 --> 00:49:50,208
...E Company still did not
have a leader.

556
00:50:01,386 --> 00:50:07,017
Before the attack, I did something
I'd never have imagined myself doing.

557
00:50:14,691 --> 00:50:16,401
Lip!

558
00:50:18,069 --> 00:50:22,157
- Didn't figure you for a smoking man.
- Neither did I.

559
00:50:25,952 --> 00:50:29,456
D Company, Lieutenant Speirs,
patrol order.

560
00:50:30,832 --> 00:50:32,208
So?

561
00:50:32,459 --> 00:50:35,337
We've been watching Foy,
not much activity.

562
00:50:35,587 --> 00:50:38,632
- Want a coffee?
- No, thank you, sir.

563
00:50:40,759 --> 00:50:44,512
- How's Easy's status?
- The men are good. Prepared.

564
00:50:44,679 --> 00:50:46,640
I lead 2nd Platoon tomorrow.

565
00:50:46,848 --> 00:50:52,437
They're the weakest after losing Toye
and Guarnere and Muck and Penkala.

566
00:50:52,687 --> 00:50:55,106
I have every confidence in the men.

567
00:50:55,357 --> 00:50:56,983
Good.

568
00:51:01,655 --> 00:51:05,742
But on the other hand,
I have no confidence in our CO.

569
00:51:06,660 --> 00:51:09,788
Lieutenant Dike is an
empty uniform, captain.

570
00:51:10,038 --> 00:51:14,501
He's just...
He's not there, sir.

571
00:51:15,835 --> 00:51:20,590
- He'll be there tomorrow.
- I understand he'll be there physically.

572
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:25,387
Tomorrow will be the real deal.
He'll have to lead those men.

573
00:51:25,637 --> 00:51:29,182
He's gonna have
to make decisions, sir, and...

574
00:51:29,432 --> 00:51:33,895
...I think he's gonna get a lot
of Easy Company men killed.

575
00:51:37,732 --> 00:51:41,611
- Thank you, sergeant. That'll be all.
- Yes, sir.

576
00:51:44,906 --> 00:51:49,828
I said what I had to say.
There was nothing Winters could do.

577
00:51:52,956 --> 00:51:56,626
Couldn't remove a
well-connected company CO...

578
00:51:56,793 --> 00:52:00,338
...because of the misgivings
of a first sergeant.

579
00:52:00,505 --> 00:52:04,676
You got an eighth of a mile
to cross before you get into Foy.

580
00:52:04,843 --> 00:52:06,678
There's very little cover.

581
00:52:06,928 --> 00:52:10,390
Two sections of machine guns
will give you cover.

582
00:52:10,598 --> 00:52:14,602
3rd Battalion will come from the east
to cause distraction.

583
00:52:14,769 --> 00:52:16,771
D Company will be in reserve.

584
00:52:16,938 --> 00:52:19,983
The point is,
you gotta move in there fast.

585
00:52:20,233 --> 00:52:24,446
Before they can bring their
mortars and artillery down on you.

586
00:52:24,613 --> 00:52:26,448
- Clear?
- Clear.

587
00:52:26,698 --> 00:52:31,036
I'm relying on you. Get it done.

588
00:52:44,466 --> 00:52:48,136
- Covering fire!
- Let's go. Keep it moving.

589
00:52:50,221 --> 00:52:52,724
Suppressing fire!

590
00:52:55,101 --> 00:52:56,978
- Go, go, go!
- Keep moving!

591
00:53:03,652 --> 00:53:05,654
Let's go! Let's go!

592
00:53:07,989 --> 00:53:10,951
- Suppressing fire!
- Feuer!

593
00:53:12,452 --> 00:53:14,579
Keep them tight, Shames!

594
00:53:15,997 --> 00:53:18,249
- Keep moving!
- Keep moving!

595
00:53:20,210 --> 00:53:21,795
Krauts in the open!

596
00:53:24,506 --> 00:53:26,758
Keep moving! Keep moving!

597
00:53:27,008 --> 00:53:28,718
Three inside!

598
00:53:31,346 --> 00:53:33,306
Wait a minute. Where's Foley?

599
00:53:34,516 --> 00:53:36,977
- Randleman!
- Coming through! Run!

600
00:53:37,227 --> 00:53:38,979
Liebgott!

601
00:53:39,896 --> 00:53:41,940
Where the hell is 1st Platoon?

602
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:48,280
- Hold up!
- Keep moving!

603
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:50,615
Easy Company! Hold up!

604
00:53:50,782 --> 00:53:54,953
- 2nd Platoon! Hold up! Hold up!
- Will you move?

605
00:53:55,203 --> 00:53:57,998
- Get me Foley on the radio.
- Move!

606
00:53:58,248 --> 00:54:03,628
- Sir, I think we should take cover.
- Find some cover! Find some cover!

607
00:54:03,878 --> 00:54:05,088
What?

608
00:54:07,257 --> 00:54:09,301
- Easy Red, Easy--
- Six, over.

609
00:54:09,551 --> 00:54:11,761
Six, Easy Red. Go ahead.

610
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:15,015
Easy Red,
stand by for the Six.

611
00:54:15,223 --> 00:54:21,187
Foley, you get back here where
I can see you, goddamn it!

612
00:54:21,438 --> 00:54:25,358
1st Platoon, hold up! Hold up!
Take cover! Martin!

613
00:54:25,608 --> 00:54:27,652
- Come with me!
- With you, sir.

614
00:54:29,195 --> 00:54:30,572
Feuer!

615
00:54:32,282 --> 00:54:34,784
Fall back! Fall back!

616
00:54:35,827 --> 00:54:37,203
Take cover!

617
00:54:37,829 --> 00:54:40,832
- Goddamn it.
- Go forward!

618
00:54:42,292 --> 00:54:45,670
- Herron, on me.
- Move back.

619
00:54:45,837 --> 00:54:47,255
Stay on my ass.

620
00:54:47,505 --> 00:54:51,426
- Hold fast, 2nd Platoon!
- Follow Lipton! Take cover!

621
00:54:51,676 --> 00:54:54,554
What are we doing?
Why are we stopped?

622
00:54:54,804 --> 00:54:57,265
Fall back! Fall back!

623
00:54:57,515 --> 00:54:59,768
Roger, Kidnap. Stand by for Six.

624
00:55:00,018 --> 00:55:03,730
- Lieutenant, what's the plan?
- I don't know!

625
00:55:04,397 --> 00:55:06,399
Get Dike on that radio now!

626
00:55:06,608 --> 00:55:09,361
- What's the plan?
- Captain Winters, sir.

627
00:55:09,527 --> 00:55:13,615
- Give us a plan!
- Okay. Foley, take your men--

628
00:55:13,990 --> 00:55:19,537
Take your men around the village
and attack from the rear.

629
00:55:20,205 --> 00:55:22,040
We cannot stay here!

630
00:55:22,248 --> 00:55:24,876
Want 1st Platoon to attack by itself?

631
00:55:25,043 --> 00:55:29,047
- We'll provide suppressing fire.
- We'll be alone out there.

632
00:55:29,214 --> 00:55:32,884
We will provide suppressing fire!

633
00:55:39,265 --> 00:55:41,851
Get going forward!

634
00:55:42,102 --> 00:55:46,606
You need to talk
to Captain Winters, sir.

635
00:55:48,608 --> 00:55:50,860
Sir! Okay, here it is.

636
00:55:51,111 --> 00:55:54,698
We go on a flanking run
and attack from the rear.

637
00:55:54,948 --> 00:55:58,159
Take them.
Find cover behind this table.

638
00:55:58,410 --> 00:56:00,704
Go! Go!

639
00:56:00,912 --> 00:56:03,081
- Shit!
- Jesus Christ.

640
00:56:04,040 --> 00:56:06,876
Webb, move up! Find cover!

641
00:56:16,511 --> 00:56:18,054
Suppressing fire now!

642
00:56:20,348 --> 00:56:22,934
Perconte! I got you!

643
00:56:23,143 --> 00:56:25,645
Give me some cover.

644
00:56:27,188 --> 00:56:30,900
- How you doing, Perconte?
- They shot me in my ass!

645
00:56:32,569 --> 00:56:36,114
- Stay down.
- We lost five men. Can you locate?

646
00:56:36,364 --> 00:56:41,870
- The building with the caved-in roof!
- The building with the caved-in roof!

647
00:56:47,626 --> 00:56:53,006
Sir, we are sitting ducks here.
We have to keep moving!

648
00:56:53,256 --> 00:56:58,011
- You've got to keep moving!
- Dick! Captain Winters!

649
00:56:58,261 --> 00:57:03,808
You do not go out there! You're the
battalion commander. Get back here!

650
00:57:04,559 --> 00:57:09,856
- I understand your attachment to Easy--
- Speirs! Get yourself over here!

651
00:57:10,106 --> 00:57:13,318
Go relieve Dike
and take that attack on in.

652
00:57:16,863 --> 00:57:20,325
- Go, soldier!
- Webb, fall back. You're too exposed!

653
00:57:21,159 --> 00:57:25,705
- Fall back! Fall back!
- Come on, Webb! Let's go, kid!

654
00:57:27,666 --> 00:57:30,919
- Hang on, Perco.
- Feuer!

655
00:57:33,338 --> 00:57:37,509
- What are we doing?
- Let's go!

656
00:57:38,301 --> 00:57:41,471
- I'm taking over. 1st Sgt. Lipton!
- Here!

657
00:57:41,638 --> 00:57:44,975
- What do we got?
- The company is spread out here.

658
00:57:45,141 --> 00:57:47,477
1st Platoon tried an end-around.

659
00:57:47,644 --> 00:57:50,605
They're pinned by a sniper
in that building.

660
00:57:50,772 --> 00:57:55,235
I want mortars and grenade launchers.
I want 1st to go straight in.

661
00:57:55,402 --> 00:57:58,488
- Everybody else, follow me.
- Thank God!

662
00:57:59,739 --> 00:58:02,450
- Move it!
- 3rd Platoon, let's go! Go!

663
00:58:03,785 --> 00:58:06,621
You heard the word.
2nd Platoon on the CO!

664
00:58:06,871 --> 00:58:09,708
- Sergeant Alley!
- Got it, sarge!

665
00:58:13,336 --> 00:58:16,631
Okay, 1st Platoon!
Move out! Move out!

666
00:58:16,881 --> 00:58:20,802
- On your feet, 2nd Platoon!
- Move out!

667
00:58:21,052 --> 00:58:25,390
Get on your goddamn feet!
Move it! Come on!

668
00:58:28,310 --> 00:58:32,480
Come on, let's get the bastards!
Right flank!

669
00:58:32,731 --> 00:58:34,316
Feuer!

670
00:58:36,359 --> 00:58:39,362
- Come on, move out!
- Fire!

671
00:58:39,613 --> 00:58:42,073
- Feuer!
- Take cover!

672
00:58:42,324 --> 00:58:43,908
Feuer!

673
00:58:45,410 --> 00:58:48,913
- Go, go, go!
- Come on! Come on!

674
00:58:50,874 --> 00:58:52,500
Radio, get over here.

675
00:58:52,751 --> 00:58:55,837
- Take cover!
- Fire!

676
00:58:56,504 --> 00:58:57,672
Sir.

677
00:58:57,964 --> 00:58:59,007
Lipton.

678
00:59:00,383 --> 00:59:02,927
Streetfight, Item. Easy Six. Over.

679
00:59:03,094 --> 00:59:06,848
- What do you see, Lipton?
- Armor and a lot of infantry.

680
00:59:07,098 --> 00:59:10,435
I Company's supposed
to be on the other side.

681
00:59:10,602 --> 00:59:12,103
- Radio, anything?
- No.

682
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:15,440
If we don't connect with I,
they'll slip away.

683
00:59:15,690 --> 00:59:18,985
- That's right. Wait here.
- Item! Item! Easy Six.

684
00:59:19,235 --> 00:59:21,029
What the hell?

685
00:59:32,582 --> 00:59:36,044
At first the Germans
didn't shoot at him.

686
00:59:36,336 --> 00:59:39,506
They couldn't believe
what they were seeing.

687
00:59:39,756 --> 00:59:42,175
That wasn't the astounding thing.

688
00:59:42,342 --> 00:59:48,556
The astounding thing was, he hooked
up with I Company and came back.

689
01:00:20,130 --> 01:00:24,884
We took over 100 German prisoners.
After that, it was mostly cleanup.

690
01:00:25,135 --> 01:00:29,639
Let's go, move it. Move it.
Take them down to the barn.

691
01:00:33,435 --> 01:00:35,061
Sit down!

692
01:00:38,481 --> 01:00:42,569
- Sniper!
- Take cover! Take cover!

693
01:00:46,197 --> 01:00:48,617
Come on! Come on!

694
01:00:48,825 --> 01:00:50,702
Where is he?

695
01:00:51,828 --> 01:00:54,873
Shit. I can't see him.

696
01:00:57,667 --> 01:01:00,128
Second floor,
building on the right.

697
01:01:00,378 --> 01:01:03,840
Don't miss, Shifty. Now!

698
01:01:24,986 --> 01:01:28,990
Over here. I need help.
Can you guys come here and help me?

699
01:01:29,157 --> 01:01:33,328
Mellet, Herron, Sowosko and
Ken Webb were killed by a sniper.

700
01:01:33,495 --> 01:01:36,498
There would have been more
if not for Shifty.

701
01:01:36,665 --> 01:01:40,794
Work your party, walk your
wounded to the aid station.

702
01:01:41,044 --> 01:01:44,297
Let's not just lollygag.
Keep this moving.

703
01:01:44,547 --> 01:01:48,677
- Get these boys to the aid station.
- Okay, sergeant.

704
01:02:00,230 --> 01:02:03,733
- You hit bad, Perconte?
- Beautiful wound, Lip.

705
01:02:03,984 --> 01:02:06,111
Shot me right through my ass.

706
01:02:06,361 --> 01:02:07,696
- Hey, sarge?
- Yeah.

707
01:02:07,946 --> 01:02:10,615
- Is it true about Dike?
- Yeah.

708
01:02:10,865 --> 01:02:15,578
- Thank God for small mercies!
- Yeah.

709
01:02:27,757 --> 01:02:33,596
We'd been looking at Foy for a month
knowing that's where we had to go.

710
01:02:33,847 --> 01:02:37,058
It was a great relief to have done it.

711
01:02:38,143 --> 01:02:40,687
The men thought once
we'd taken Foy...

712
01:02:40,854 --> 01:02:44,774
...they'd get us off the line,
ship us back to Mourmelon.

713
01:02:45,025 --> 01:02:46,693
But that wasn't to be.

714
01:02:46,943 --> 01:02:51,448
Two days later, we took Noville
and after that, Rachamps.

715
01:03:12,469 --> 01:03:15,513
We spent our night
in Rachamps in a convent.

716
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:19,768
It was the first time we'd spent
a night indoors in a month.

717
01:03:31,571 --> 01:03:36,910
The sisters brought in their choir
to sing for us. It was heaven.

718
01:03:43,583 --> 01:03:45,794
The mood of the men was relaxed.

719
01:03:45,961 --> 01:03:50,173
We were finally being relieved
and would soon be in Mourmelon.

720
01:03:50,340 --> 01:03:53,718
In the morning, we found out
Mourmelon would wait.

721
01:03:53,885 --> 01:03:56,262
Hitler had launched a counteroffensive.

722
01:03:56,429 --> 01:03:59,349
We were bound for Hagenau
to hold the line.

723
01:03:59,516 --> 01:04:05,689
But for that night, we didn't know it yet.
That night, we were okay.

724
01:04:23,623 --> 01:04:28,044
I tried to make a roster for
the company to see who we had left.

725
01:04:28,211 --> 01:04:33,049
We'd come into Belgium with 121 men
and officers plus 24 replacements.

726
01:04:33,300 --> 01:04:39,055
That's 145 total.
We were going out with 63.

727
01:04:39,723 --> 01:04:44,311
Guarnere was badly wounded,
and Hoobler died accidentally.

728
01:04:47,397 --> 01:04:50,108
Joe Toye had lost his leg.

729
01:04:55,989 --> 01:05:00,118
Among the dead were Herron,
Mellet, Sowosko, Kenneth Webb...

730
01:05:00,327 --> 01:05:04,914
...Harold Webb, Alex Penkala
and Skip Muck.

731
01:05:07,667 --> 01:05:11,755
A month in Belgium cost us
one good officer, Buck Compton...

732
01:05:11,921 --> 01:05:15,550
...and one bad one, Norman Dike.

733
01:05:19,054 --> 01:05:24,768
But we gained a good one in the end,
so I guess we came out ahead.

734
01:05:34,444 --> 01:05:38,156
- What is it?
- Nothing.

735
01:05:39,824 --> 01:05:44,120
I better get back to Battalion
before they disappear.

736
01:05:51,127 --> 01:05:54,130
- You wanna ask me, don't you?
- Ask you what?

737
01:05:54,297 --> 01:05:57,884
You wanna know if they're true,
the stories about me.

738
01:05:58,176 --> 01:06:02,847
With stories like that, everyone
heard it from someone who was there.

739
01:06:03,014 --> 01:06:08,186
When you ask that person, they say they
heard it from someone who was there.

740
01:06:08,353 --> 01:06:09,896
It's nothing new.

741
01:06:10,063 --> 01:06:13,900
If you went back 2000 years,
you'd hear centurions...

742
01:06:14,067 --> 01:06:19,364
...yakking about how Tertius lopped off
the heads of Carthaginian prisoners.

743
01:06:19,531 --> 01:06:25,996
Maybe they kept talking about it because
they never heard Tertius deny it.

744
01:06:26,162 --> 01:06:30,375
Maybe Tertius knew
there was value to men thinking...

745
01:06:30,542 --> 01:06:34,879
...he was the toughest son of
a bitch in the whole Roman Legion.

746
01:06:35,714 --> 01:06:37,716
Sir?

747
01:06:39,092 --> 01:06:42,304
These men aren't
concerned about the stories.

748
01:06:42,470 --> 01:06:45,390
They're just glad to have you
as our CO.

749
01:06:45,557 --> 01:06:48,435
They're happy to have
a good leader again.

750
01:06:48,685 --> 01:06:51,146
I've heard they've always had one.

751
01:06:51,313 --> 01:06:55,066
I'm told there's been
one man they could count on.

752
01:06:55,275 --> 01:07:00,113
Led them into Bois Jacques, held
them together as they were shelled.

753
01:07:00,280 --> 01:07:05,076
Kept their spirits up, kept the men
focused, gave them direction.

754
01:07:05,243 --> 01:07:08,997
All the things
a good combat leader does.

755
01:07:13,460 --> 01:07:16,463
Do you have any idea
who I'm talking about?

756
01:07:16,630 --> 01:07:20,675
- No, sir.
- Hell, it was you, first sergeant.

757
01:07:20,842 --> 01:07:26,056
Ever since Winters made Battalion,
you've been the leader of Easy Company.

758
01:07:30,393 --> 01:07:36,816
Oh, and you're not gonna be first
sergeant much longer, first sergeant.

759
01:07:36,983 --> 01:07:38,568
Sir?

760
01:07:39,027 --> 01:07:43,323
Winters put in for a battlefield
commission. Sink approved.

761
01:07:43,490 --> 01:07:47,202
You should get the official nod
in a few days.

762
01:07:49,204 --> 01:07:52,707
Congratulations, lieutenant.

763
01:08:14,562 --> 01:08:16,940
Hey, look, it's 1st Battalion.

764
01:08:17,148 --> 01:08:19,609
- Hey! Hey!
- What do you want?

765
01:08:19,776 --> 01:08:22,279
Thanks for crapping in our foxholes.

766
01:08:22,779 --> 01:08:25,365
- Hey, it's our pleasure.
- Yeah.

767
01:08:25,532 --> 01:08:28,410
Enjoy the walk, boys.

768
01:08:40,255 --> 01:08:44,801
There they go, Easy Company,
riding out again.
