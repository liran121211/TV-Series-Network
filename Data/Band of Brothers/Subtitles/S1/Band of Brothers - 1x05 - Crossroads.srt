1
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:32,684
If you're a leader, you lead the way.

2
00:02:33,045 --> 00:02:38,404
Not just on the easy ones.
You take the tough ones too.

3
00:02:38,844 --> 00:02:43,873
A good leader has to understand
the people that are under him...

4
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:46,910
...understand their needs...

5
00:02:47,270 --> 00:02:50,343
...their desires or how they think
a little bit.

6
00:02:50,391 --> 00:02:54,128
He always made the right
decisions along the way.

7
00:02:54,529 --> 00:02:56,520
He was a real soldier.

8
00:02:56,865 --> 00:03:00,984
Some of the officers...

9
00:03:01,412 --> 00:03:04,610
I don't think I'd follow
them into water.

10
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,675
But he was one of the best.

11
00:03:09,047 --> 00:03:14,725
He went right in there and he didn't--
He never thought of not being first...

12
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:19,738
...or sending somebody in his place.

13
00:03:20,185 --> 00:03:22,938
I don't know how he survived.

14
00:03:26,901 --> 00:03:29,017
But he did.

15
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,405
Lew? Wake up.

16
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,495
They want us back at Regiment.

17
00:04:41,157 --> 00:04:45,070
Come on Nix, get up. Let's go.

18
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:49,541
- Something's up.
- I'll be right down.

19
00:04:49,917 --> 00:04:52,273
- You got 10 minutes.
- Go away.

20
00:04:52,629 --> 00:04:54,540
Come on. Let's go.

21
00:04:54,881 --> 00:04:58,238
- Leave me alone.
- Okay.

22
00:04:59,845 --> 00:05:02,440
- Come on.
- Damn it!

23
00:05:03,266 --> 00:05:07,180
That's my own piss, for chrissake!

24
00:05:10,358 --> 00:05:13,476
Son of a bitch.

25
00:05:14,821 --> 00:05:20,260
We're the only unit that's got the
Germans on their side of the Rhine.

26
00:05:21,412 --> 00:05:24,132
If we'd taken Antwerp...

27
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:28,657
...we'd be well-supplied
and have the Krauts on their heels.

28
00:05:29,047 --> 00:05:32,836
If I can just get lke on the phone.
Are you listening?

29
00:05:33,219 --> 00:05:35,813
Hanging on every word.

30
00:05:39,059 --> 00:05:41,937
- Moose, you too?
- Yeah, Sink's not happy.

31
00:05:42,688 --> 00:05:44,327
Nixon, Heyliger.

32
00:05:44,899 --> 00:05:48,893
Colonel Dobie, British 1 st Airborne.
Nixon is our S2.

33
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,918
That's 1 st Lt. Heyliger.

34
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:54,392
The Brits lost 8000 men
when Market Garden fell...

35
00:05:54,786 --> 00:05:58,905
...which is why Colonel Dobie
has to coordinate a rescue...

36
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,369
...for the troops who are trapped.

37
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:04,230
Dutch Resistance are hiding
140 men...

38
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:07,150
...outside a town
north of the river.

39
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:09,819
They'll assemble in the woods.

40
00:06:10,179 --> 00:06:13,171
Pick a team and get them
across the Rhine.

41
00:06:13,559 --> 00:06:16,915
- 140 men?
- The Canadians have supplied six boats.

42
00:06:17,313 --> 00:06:21,068
The rendezvous point is landable.
I swam it last night.

43
00:06:21,484 --> 00:06:26,240
At 0030, they'll signal V for victory
with a hand-held red torch.

44
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:28,576
That'd be a red flashlight.

45
00:06:28,826 --> 00:06:32,422
Operation Pegasus.
2nd Battalion is on the spot.

46
00:06:32,831 --> 00:06:37,462
Assist Colonel Dobie.
If you need anything, come to me.

47
00:06:37,921 --> 00:06:40,277
I can't ask for more.

48
00:06:40,591 --> 00:06:43,389
You didn't endorse
the Market Garden report...

49
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:47,755
- ...or the TO&E. Why?
- I'll have them at CP 1300, sir.

50
00:06:48,183 --> 00:06:53,542
I want an inventory on material the
British 43rd left. Rations, supplies.

51
00:06:54,023 --> 00:06:55,173
Yes, sir.

52
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,594
- Dick.
- Sir.

53
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:59,853
I need your report
on that operation.

54
00:07:00,365 --> 00:07:03,437
- Yes, sir.
- Light a fire under it.

55
00:07:03,826 --> 00:07:08,378
We asked for this yesterday.
A day late and a dollar short.

56
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:11,829
Enemy maps in the S2.
Let's look at that.

57
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:13,603
There's 100 of them?

58
00:07:29,274 --> 00:07:31,231
This is it, boys.

59
00:07:31,569 --> 00:07:34,879
They have to get across the
river and over the dyke.

60
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:38,277
- That's a lot to cover.
- Where do we go?

61
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:41,380
You, Hashey? You get the penthouse.

62
00:07:41,706 --> 00:07:44,345
Thank you. We're up top.

63
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:47,270
- How bad does it get?
- You'll find out.

64
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:51,305
- That's a lot of ground.
- Couple of regular Gl Joes.

65
00:07:51,676 --> 00:07:54,315
You said it.
Come on.

66
00:07:55,930 --> 00:08:00,482
New guys giving the replacements
the what-for and why-is.

67
00:08:01,313 --> 00:08:04,544
- I swear one of them has never shaved.
- Kids.

68
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:07,058
This is a hell of a dog, Tab.

69
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:10,114
- There you go.
- What'd you call it, Tab?

70
00:08:10,781 --> 00:08:15,936
- Trigger.
- That's good, I like that. Trigger.

71
00:08:16,413 --> 00:08:18,644
- Got anything?
- It's quiet.

72
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:20,835
- Penetration!
- Alley's hurt!

73
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:25,163
All right, get him on the table.
It's Alley.

74
00:08:25,549 --> 00:08:26,743
I got this.

75
00:08:27,052 --> 00:08:28,963
Alley, you're gonna be okay.

76
00:08:29,262 --> 00:08:32,255
- Get Doc Roe.
- Where am I? What happened?

77
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:35,433
- Where was it?
- Crossroads.

78
00:08:35,811 --> 00:08:38,963
- It was because of your loud mouth!
- Back off!

79
00:08:39,358 --> 00:08:42,556
Send for Lieutenant Welsh.
Assemble a squad.

80
00:08:42,904 --> 00:08:46,613
1 st Squad, on your feet!
Weapons and ammo only!

81
00:08:47,033 --> 00:08:48,672
Let's go, let's go!

82
00:08:48,953 --> 00:08:53,266
Get the boots off and elevate the leg.
Liebgott, use the sulfur.

83
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,666
Let's get this done quickly.
We gotta move.

84
00:08:57,003 --> 00:08:58,039
Hey, Alley.

85
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,160
- MG42?
- Yeah.

86
00:09:42,474 --> 00:09:45,467
What are they shooting at?
What's down there?

87
00:09:45,812 --> 00:09:47,404
Headquarters.

88
00:09:47,689 --> 00:09:50,921
That's three miles away.
Why reveal position?

89
00:09:51,319 --> 00:09:55,438
- Not as smart as me and you?
- I'll check it out anyway.

90
00:09:56,283 --> 00:09:59,993
- Hold here. Wait for my signal.
- Yes, sir.

91
00:10:04,793 --> 00:10:07,990
Holding here.
I'm waiting for a signal.

92
00:11:35,985 --> 00:11:38,136
This is our fallback position.

93
00:11:38,447 --> 00:11:42,487
Mortars, deploy here.
1 st Squad, on me.

94
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,423
Go!

95
00:12:51,117 --> 00:12:54,030
Second on the right.

96
00:12:54,413 --> 00:12:56,973
First on the right.

97
00:12:59,252 --> 00:13:02,130
Third on the right.
Nail the machine gun.

98
00:13:02,463 --> 00:13:05,297
Second on the left.
First on the left.

99
00:13:05,634 --> 00:13:07,943
Wait for my signal.

100
00:13:08,262 --> 00:13:13,132
- Prepare to fire.
- Two rounds, ain't she quick?

101
00:13:45,557 --> 00:13:47,707
- Fall back!
- Fire.

102
00:13:58,113 --> 00:13:59,705
Fire!

103
00:14:10,127 --> 00:14:11,277
Higgins!

104
00:14:11,546 --> 00:14:15,061
Handful of Krauts,
on the dyke, 12 o'clock!

105
00:14:16,636 --> 00:14:19,548
- How many Krauts are left?
- I don't know.

106
00:14:19,889 --> 00:14:22,279
But we got seven in one blow.

107
00:14:24,561 --> 00:14:27,679
Bring on Boyle and Perconte. Go!

108
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,094
Come on, fall back!

109
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:32,519
Suppressing fire!

110
00:14:32,822 --> 00:14:34,858
Suppressing fire!

111
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,317
Hashey, Garcia, follow me!

112
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:45,818
Tell Peacock to bring the balance
of 1 st Platoon!

113
00:14:46,254 --> 00:14:48,689
And another machine gun squad.

114
00:14:49,008 --> 00:14:53,719
Dukeman! Go get that machine gun
on the right flank. Go!

115
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:55,772
Christenson!

116
00:14:57,101 --> 00:14:59,410
Fuck! Dukeman's down.

117
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:19,613
Sir, the balance of 1 st Platoon
is here.

118
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:23,159
Gordon and More brought
another .30 cal.

119
00:15:25,885 --> 00:15:27,603
Sir?

120
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:34,031
They're behind a solid embankment.
We're in a ditch.

121
00:15:34,437 --> 00:15:39,751
They can outflank us along the dyke
as soon as they figure it out.

122
00:15:41,028 --> 00:15:45,341
- How many Krauts are there?
- There's a ferry crossing here...

123
00:15:45,742 --> 00:15:48,416
...so it could be a whole battalion.

124
00:15:49,872 --> 00:15:53,786
Okay. What are your orders?

125
00:15:57,172 --> 00:15:59,687
We got no choice.

126
00:16:03,221 --> 00:16:06,532
Here. Talbert, you'll take
10 men along the dyke.

127
00:16:06,934 --> 00:16:11,611
Peacock, take 10 along the left flank.
I'll take 10 up the middle.

128
00:16:12,023 --> 00:16:14,902
Questions? Go.

129
00:16:18,447 --> 00:16:20,564
Enter.

130
00:16:44,478 --> 00:16:48,472
- I don't know why I'm still doing this.
- What, drinking?

131
00:16:49,026 --> 00:16:54,659
No, hiding it in your footlocker.
I'm a captain, for chrissake.

132
00:16:55,117 --> 00:16:57,108
Well, why don't you...?

133
00:16:57,453 --> 00:17:00,571
Why don't you just give it up?

134
00:17:00,957 --> 00:17:03,755
- Drinking?
- No.

135
00:17:04,127 --> 00:17:08,440
Hiding it in my footlocker.
You're a captain, for Pete's sake.

136
00:17:11,386 --> 00:17:14,503
Maybe this is the place
to stop drinking.

137
00:17:14,848 --> 00:17:18,683
Right here on the business end
of the Allied advance.

138
00:17:19,771 --> 00:17:21,683
Cheers.

139
00:17:40,003 --> 00:17:42,916
That's not literature,
just keep it simple.

140
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:47,691
Try using the first person plural.
Say "we" a lot.

141
00:17:48,097 --> 00:17:50,247
Thanks for the tip.

142
00:17:55,647 --> 00:17:56,967
Fix bayonets.

143
00:18:02,531 --> 00:18:04,840
Go on the red smoke.

144
00:18:37,781 --> 00:18:39,578
No! Wait for the signal!

145
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,021
Jesus.

146
00:19:40,439 --> 00:19:43,431
Come on, pour it on!
Shoot your targets!

147
00:19:44,694 --> 00:19:46,491
Let them have it!

148
00:19:50,827 --> 00:19:52,704
Come on, boys!

149
00:19:56,959 --> 00:19:58,108
Four.

150
00:19:59,461 --> 00:20:00,895
Five.

151
00:20:04,259 --> 00:20:06,376
Holy shit!

152
00:20:08,848 --> 00:20:13,127
- It's a whole other company!
- No shit!

153
00:20:22,573 --> 00:20:27,045
Easy Beaver to Easy Minor!
Reinforce Easy at phase one yellow!

154
00:20:27,495 --> 00:20:31,205
Plus one, strike three.
Fire concentration Charlie.

155
00:20:31,584 --> 00:20:34,621
Drop 200, left 100.

156
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:39,756
Repeat, plus one, strike three!
Fire concentration Charlie.

157
00:20:40,218 --> 00:20:42,653
Drop 200, left 100!

158
00:20:43,222 --> 00:20:46,659
Krauts in the open!
Fire for effect! Over!

159
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:55,270
- What's he saying?
- He says they're Polish.

160
00:20:55,570 --> 00:20:57,960
There are no Poles in the SS!

161
00:20:58,324 --> 00:20:59,882
Move!

162
00:21:01,368 --> 00:21:03,166
Jesus Christ!

163
00:21:07,835 --> 00:21:10,030
Oh, shit!

164
00:21:17,764 --> 00:21:22,475
- Send Lightning a report. Boyle!
- Lightning, Lightning. Over.

165
00:21:22,937 --> 00:21:25,576
Go up and spot the fall
of those rounds.

166
00:21:31,863 --> 00:21:33,502
Incoming rounds!

167
00:21:33,825 --> 00:21:36,498
Easy Company, take cover!

168
00:21:37,788 --> 00:21:40,985
- Boyle's hit!
- Jesus Christ, they got me!

169
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,371
Take cover! it's German artillery!

170
00:21:46,214 --> 00:21:49,810
Get Boyle, he's down!
Come on, help me!

171
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,582
Jesus, captain, they're SS.

172
00:22:33,312 --> 00:22:34,541
Joe?

173
00:22:35,273 --> 00:22:38,151
- Joe, knock it off.
- Goddamn it, what?

174
00:22:40,529 --> 00:22:41,928
- You're hit.
- I'm okay.

175
00:22:42,239 --> 00:22:45,550
Take these prisoners to CP,
and get cleaned up.

176
00:22:45,952 --> 00:22:48,307
Yes, sir.
Come on, Kraut boys.

177
00:22:48,622 --> 00:22:50,056
- Joe?
- Yeah.

178
00:22:50,374 --> 00:22:52,524
- Drop your ammo.
- What?

179
00:22:53,586 --> 00:22:56,385
- You kidding me?
- Give me your weapon.

180
00:22:59,969 --> 00:23:03,757
You have one round.
Johnny, how many prisoners are there?

181
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,814
Got 11 right now, sir.

182
00:23:07,645 --> 00:23:13,801
Drop a prisoner, the rest'll jump you.
I want all prisoners alive.

183
00:23:14,277 --> 00:23:15,597
Yes, sir.

184
00:23:23,330 --> 00:23:27,802
"They got me. " You believe that?
You believe I said that?

185
00:23:28,628 --> 00:23:31,427
- Can you make it back to CP?
- Yeah.

186
00:23:33,676 --> 00:23:36,111
I will see you someplace else.

187
00:23:37,389 --> 00:23:40,222
Take these to Battalion.

188
00:23:40,977 --> 00:23:43,047
- And split them up.
- Yes, sir.

189
00:23:50,446 --> 00:23:51,846
All right.

190
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:55,380
Here you are.

191
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:59,192
- We had them on the run.
- How's that?

192
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:03,375
They were flooding back
when we hit them with artillery.

193
00:24:03,795 --> 00:24:05,308
It was a turkey shoot.

194
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:09,419
They hit us with their 88s,
zeroed in on this crossroad.

195
00:24:09,844 --> 00:24:13,394
Now we were lucky, though.
Only 22 wounded.

196
00:24:13,807 --> 00:24:14,922
Lucky.

197
00:24:15,225 --> 00:24:17,421
- Captain Winters?
- Down there, sir.

198
00:24:17,771 --> 00:24:19,648
All right, carry on.

199
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:27,585
All right, Krauts.

200
00:25:04,785 --> 00:25:07,618
Twenty-two wounded, huh?
You okay?

201
00:25:07,997 --> 00:25:10,465
- Yeah. One killed.
- Who?

202
00:25:10,834 --> 00:25:12,951
Dukeman.

203
00:25:14,505 --> 00:25:16,143
Dukeman.

204
00:25:19,678 --> 00:25:23,228
You're looking at
two full companies of SS.

205
00:25:23,599 --> 00:25:26,591
About 50 dead,
probably another 100 wounded.

206
00:25:26,936 --> 00:25:32,250
Seven back in the regimental cage,
plus a whole string of them up there.

207
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,455
That's not bad for Dukeman.

208
00:25:36,197 --> 00:25:39,747
You got a drink? Of water?

209
00:25:44,541 --> 00:25:46,497
Yeah, that's water.

210
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:57,325
Thanks.

211
00:26:15,161 --> 00:26:18,312
363rd Volksgrenadier hit Opheusden...

212
00:26:18,706 --> 00:26:22,461
...about the same time your SS
made a run for my CP.

213
00:26:22,836 --> 00:26:25,476
3rd Battalion got a beating.

214
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,357
- Ollie Horton was killed.
- Major Horton's dead?

215
00:26:30,763 --> 00:26:36,441
They hit 2nd Battalion CP in force.
He was organizing the defense.

216
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:40,229
Captain, excuse us just for a minute.

217
00:26:54,624 --> 00:26:57,662
How would you feel
about handling a battalion?

218
00:26:58,045 --> 00:26:59,273
Sir?

219
00:26:59,588 --> 00:27:04,458
You're XO of 2nd Battalion.
Colonel Strayer is...

220
00:27:04,928 --> 00:27:07,045
Well, he could use some help.

221
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:09,904
I can handle them in the field.

222
00:27:10,268 --> 00:27:13,579
You're a solid tactician
and a good leader.

223
00:27:13,981 --> 00:27:16,576
Don't worry about administration.

224
00:27:25,035 --> 00:27:30,588
- Who will be taking over Easy, sir?
- Moose Heyliger can command Easy.

225
00:27:31,042 --> 00:27:33,921
- Heyliger would be my choice, sir.
- Good.

226
00:27:34,255 --> 00:27:37,885
You pack your gear and come on up
to Battalion CP.

227
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:44,085
Like some coffee, sir?

228
00:27:44,767 --> 00:27:48,238
- Yeah. Thanks, doc.
- All right.

229
00:27:49,148 --> 00:27:53,142
Hey, Dick! You finish your novel yet?

230
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:57,700
- That's a lot of homework.
- And I thought XO was a fun job.

231
00:27:58,117 --> 00:28:00,790
- Who are you?
- Zielinski, sir.

232
00:28:01,162 --> 00:28:05,202
- Who is he?
- Zielinski's my orderly.

233
00:28:06,793 --> 00:28:08,512
Rank has its privileges.

234
00:28:08,838 --> 00:28:12,878
- Orderly? I suppose you get coffee?
- Can do, sir.

235
00:28:13,677 --> 00:28:15,508
Black, no sugar.

236
00:28:15,805 --> 00:28:19,116
And a bacon sandwich. You?
Bacon sandwich!

237
00:28:19,518 --> 00:28:23,068
Give that to Colonel Sink.
With my compliments.

238
00:28:24,106 --> 00:28:28,658
All that for two pages?
Guess that's gonna take a while.

239
00:28:29,112 --> 00:28:31,546
Yeah, it is. You want a job?

240
00:28:31,907 --> 00:28:36,026
There it is. Wishes he were
back in charge of Easy.

241
00:28:36,621 --> 00:28:38,533
You just here to gloat?

242
00:28:38,874 --> 00:28:42,867
Just to rub it in.
Moose is leading his first mission.

243
00:28:43,295 --> 00:28:46,447
Operation Pegasus is set to go off.

244
00:28:46,842 --> 00:28:49,437
Pegasus. Yeah.

245
00:28:50,138 --> 00:28:53,096
Yeah, great.
Everybody know their job?

246
00:28:53,474 --> 00:28:57,707
We drilled with the boats.
Welsh and the Canadians are coming.

247
00:28:58,147 --> 00:29:01,220
- Dobie's good.
- How many times will you cross?

248
00:29:01,609 --> 00:29:04,602
If there are 140 Brits,
three trips.

249
00:29:04,989 --> 00:29:07,344
What time is jump-off?

250
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,376
- We'll be ready at 0100.
- Speed is the key.

251
00:29:11,746 --> 00:29:14,341
- Keep moving and lead the way.
- Dick.

252
00:29:14,667 --> 00:29:17,465
Easy's in good hands.

253
00:29:17,837 --> 00:29:19,111
Yeah.

254
00:29:19,464 --> 00:29:24,015
- Yeah, right. Well, hang tough.
- I could say the same to you.

255
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:28,634
- Good luck, Moose.
- Captain.

256
00:29:29,977 --> 00:29:35,735
- Are we sure on the intelligence?
- Well, I think it's pretty good.

257
00:29:36,193 --> 00:29:39,583
Is Easy walking into another
company of Germans?

258
00:29:39,989 --> 00:29:43,140
Why don't we ask Moose
when he gets back.

259
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,913
Right, yeah.

260
00:29:46,246 --> 00:29:49,921
If they do run into any trouble,
you'll let me know?

261
00:29:50,293 --> 00:29:51,851
Yeah.

262
00:29:52,295 --> 00:29:56,448
You run into any bacon sandwich,
do the same, all right?

263
00:29:57,927 --> 00:29:59,280
Yeah.

264
00:30:29,464 --> 00:30:32,377
- Line secure, sir.
- Fall back into position.

265
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:37,073
- I got the .30 cal. on the left flank.
- Extend it out 10 yards.

266
00:30:37,474 --> 00:30:40,466
So, colonel, where are they?

267
00:30:41,646 --> 00:30:42,874
- Leicester.
- Square.

268
00:30:43,189 --> 00:30:45,305
Come on in.

269
00:30:45,984 --> 00:30:48,055
- Welcome back.
- Good to be back.

270
00:30:48,362 --> 00:30:50,922
Heyliger. 506 of the 101 st Airborne.

271
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,550
I'm so glad to see a bloody Yank.

272
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:58,780
- Your show, colonel.
- I'll be back shortly. Go!

273
00:31:00,835 --> 00:31:04,226
- Boats are all secure, sir.
- Bull!

274
00:31:05,424 --> 00:31:08,417
The Brits are on their way.
Pass the word.

275
00:31:11,681 --> 00:31:15,470
Sir, you missed a signature here.

276
00:31:24,113 --> 00:31:26,388
- Moose Heyliger.
- That's me, sir.

277
00:31:26,699 --> 00:31:30,534
- God bless you.
- We're ready. Where's the rest of you?

278
00:31:30,954 --> 00:31:33,071
I'll get them.

279
00:31:37,295 --> 00:31:41,335
- And here we all are.
- Well, let's go.

280
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:47,372
- Wahai Mohammed!
- Wahai Mohammed!

281
00:31:47,766 --> 00:31:52,887
Moose and the American 101 st have
done the Red Devils a great service.

282
00:31:53,357 --> 00:31:58,591
Making it possible for us to return
and fight the enemy another day.

283
00:31:59,864 --> 00:32:05,098
- To Easy Company, victory and Currahee!
- Currahee!

284
00:32:14,674 --> 00:32:18,553
I was CO only four months.
Before that, Meehan, Sobel.

285
00:32:21,181 --> 00:32:25,061
You were the only combat CO.
And I'm from another company.

286
00:32:25,478 --> 00:32:30,428
You know where they came from and
what they've been through. Hang tough.

287
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:34,330
Train your new platoon leaders.
Trust your noncoms.

288
00:32:34,739 --> 00:32:36,889
- Halt!
- It's Moose!

289
00:32:37,534 --> 00:32:39,286
Hold your fire!

290
00:32:42,874 --> 00:32:44,831
Okay, buddy.

291
00:32:46,879 --> 00:32:49,109
Oh, my God.

292
00:32:49,464 --> 00:32:52,104
Send for Lieutenant Welsh.

293
00:32:52,594 --> 00:32:54,870
Stay awake on me, Moose.

294
00:32:55,222 --> 00:32:57,178
Send for Lieutenant Welsh!

295
00:32:57,641 --> 00:32:59,074
Okay, okay.

296
00:33:00,145 --> 00:33:04,343
I'm sorry, sir! I'm so sorry!
I didn't know. Jesus Christ!

297
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:06,770
- Where are you from?
- Wyoming.

298
00:33:07,111 --> 00:33:09,102
You're a long way from home.

299
00:33:09,405 --> 00:33:11,636
- Stretcher!
- You give him morphine?

300
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:15,101
- How much?
- Can't remember. Two, three Syrettes.

301
00:33:15,455 --> 00:33:18,970
- Were you trying to kill him?!
- I think it was two.

302
00:33:19,334 --> 00:33:22,133
It might be important
to know the dosage!

303
00:33:22,504 --> 00:33:25,462
I don't see one Syrette on his jacket!

304
00:33:25,842 --> 00:33:30,040
- He's a big man. Maybe he has a chance.
- We didn't know.

305
00:33:30,472 --> 00:33:34,386
You are officers, you are grownups,
you ought to know!

306
00:33:34,769 --> 00:33:37,568
All right, let's go! Come on, move it!

307
00:33:54,209 --> 00:33:58,965
- Once more.
- About face! Forward, march!

308
00:34:00,174 --> 00:34:04,487
Easy still has only 65 percent
strength, most are replacements...

309
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:06,728
...including their new CO.

310
00:34:07,058 --> 00:34:08,571
How's Lt. Dike doing?

311
00:34:08,851 --> 00:34:11,763
The guys are calling him
"Foxhole Norman."

312
00:34:12,147 --> 00:34:18,417
They're talking mid-March action. Train
them 3 months, go into Berlin, end it.

313
00:34:19,114 --> 00:34:23,108
The only thing holding Easy together
is the NCOs.

314
00:34:23,536 --> 00:34:25,811
Sir, Sergeant Guarnere is here.

315
00:34:26,163 --> 00:34:28,883
- Look what just came in.
- The daredevil.

316
00:34:29,251 --> 00:34:31,242
- Hi, captain.
- Welcome back.

317
00:34:31,545 --> 00:34:36,222
- Never thought you'd be behind a desk.
- Someday, he'll sit behind it.

318
00:34:36,634 --> 00:34:40,548
I'm AWOL from the hospital.
Hope that won't cause trouble.

319
00:34:40,931 --> 00:34:44,891
- Would you care if it did?
- Not a bit, sir.

320
00:34:46,688 --> 00:34:51,046
Got a letter for you here from Moose.
Lieutenant Heyliger, sir.

321
00:34:51,485 --> 00:34:55,115
- He's recovering, but it'll be tough.
- Thanks, Bill.

322
00:34:56,450 --> 00:35:00,490
There's gonna be a football game?
Those guys in the 502nd?

323
00:35:00,872 --> 00:35:06,709
- Oh, yeah, Christmas Day.
- Great! Skytrain boys. Can't wait.

324
00:35:10,425 --> 00:35:12,097
Great.

325
00:35:15,556 --> 00:35:21,348
- Well, I'll just go find some trouble.
- You do that.

326
00:35:22,189 --> 00:35:23,987
- Hey, Bill?
- Sir.

327
00:35:24,275 --> 00:35:26,630
No more joy riding, right?

328
00:35:29,531 --> 00:35:34,890
Anybody ever heard
of a little joint called Lulu's?

329
00:35:35,538 --> 00:35:37,335
Got me.

330
00:35:38,041 --> 00:35:40,636
I'll just ask around.

331
00:35:48,053 --> 00:35:51,046
Well, I guess now is
as good a time as any.

332
00:35:51,391 --> 00:35:53,666
I don't wanna see another paper.

333
00:35:53,977 --> 00:35:58,256
General Taylor's in Washington.
General McAuliffe's in charge.

334
00:35:58,649 --> 00:36:04,680
- Sink is in Rheims to see Dietrich.
- Marlene Dietrich? I'm going to Rheims.

335
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:08,350
Strayer will be in London
for another week.

336
00:36:08,744 --> 00:36:12,101
I'm heading to Aldbourne
to look up a young lady.

337
00:36:12,457 --> 00:36:16,337
- What are you telling me?
- You are headed to Paris.

338
00:36:16,713 --> 00:36:21,708
That's a 48-hour pass. it's been
decided you need a little civilization.

339
00:36:22,136 --> 00:36:23,728
Bon voyage.

340
00:36:28,685 --> 00:36:30,517
Second that.

341
00:36:48,459 --> 00:36:52,135
- I got two friends in the Airborne.
- Give me a break.

342
00:36:52,505 --> 00:36:54,780
We're all on the same side.

343
00:36:55,133 --> 00:36:59,207
- Marines?
- Marines are the toughest bunch going.

344
00:36:59,597 --> 00:37:01,270
- Marines?
- Wait a second.

345
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,672
No, the Airborne is as tough
as they come.

346
00:37:05,020 --> 00:37:07,660
You should see the basic training.

347
00:37:08,024 --> 00:37:14,260
You know what I did in basic training?
I had to eat rats in basic training.

348
00:37:14,782 --> 00:37:17,422
Well, that's the first time...

349
00:41:00,843 --> 00:41:03,881
When I look at you,
I see eight or nine of you.

350
00:41:04,223 --> 00:41:07,374
- I'll be all right...
- "Look at me. I'm John Wayne.

351
00:41:07,727 --> 00:41:11,003
The costume department gave me
these Navy whites--"

352
00:41:11,356 --> 00:41:14,747
- Luz, shut up.
- I'm trying to watch this.

353
00:41:15,111 --> 00:41:18,661
- I've seen this film 13 times.
- I haven't, so shut up.

354
00:41:19,032 --> 00:41:21,546
- Watch the movie, fine.
- Skip!

355
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:23,185
Come on!

356
00:41:23,454 --> 00:41:27,288
- Where you been?
- Well, I was at home in Tonawanda...

357
00:41:27,667 --> 00:41:30,626
...then Hitler started this,
so now I'm here.

358
00:41:30,963 --> 00:41:34,957
- How'd you make out in craps?
- Here's the $60 I borrowed.

359
00:41:35,343 --> 00:41:38,335
- You're paying me back?
- And a thank-you.

360
00:41:38,681 --> 00:41:40,672
- Surprising.
- A tip!

361
00:41:40,975 --> 00:41:43,170
- Jesus!
- Shut up!

362
00:41:43,477 --> 00:41:46,470
- Only $3600 left.
- What'll you do with that?

363
00:41:46,815 --> 00:41:49,933
- Blow most of it in Paris.
- Give me a tip.

364
00:41:50,278 --> 00:41:55,911
That climate doesn't agree with you.
I've been worried about your health.

365
00:41:56,368 --> 00:41:58,598
- Hey, Buck.
- You don't look well.

366
00:41:58,955 --> 00:42:04,110
How are you feeling?
Your wounds heal? All four of them?

367
00:42:06,172 --> 00:42:08,606
You seen this before?

368
00:42:10,594 --> 00:42:12,186
Buck.

369
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,194
Hi.

370
00:42:15,516 --> 00:42:17,586
Is it any good?

371
00:42:19,354 --> 00:42:20,754
Yeah.

372
00:42:21,231 --> 00:42:23,620
It's a real corker.

373
00:42:34,789 --> 00:42:37,350
Lip, favorite part.

374
00:42:37,668 --> 00:42:39,624
"Got a penny?"

375
00:42:39,962 --> 00:42:42,602
"Got a penny?"

376
00:42:45,844 --> 00:42:48,119
"Got a penny?"

377
00:42:48,514 --> 00:42:50,745
- Got a penny?
- Sure.

378
00:42:51,101 --> 00:42:52,659
What?

379
00:42:56,273 --> 00:42:57,501
Quiet!

380
00:42:57,775 --> 00:43:00,529
- Come on.
- Quiet!

381
00:43:02,114 --> 00:43:04,344
I said, quiet!

382
00:43:04,658 --> 00:43:09,335
The 1 st and the 6th SS Panzer Divisions
broke through in Ardennes.

383
00:43:09,747 --> 00:43:12,626
They overran the 28th infantry
and the 4th.

384
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:17,193
Officers, report to respective HQs.
All passes are canceled.

385
00:43:17,590 --> 00:43:21,550
Enlisted men, report to barracks
and your platoon leaders.

386
00:43:28,979 --> 00:43:32,416
- Damn, what a day.
- Unbelievable.

387
00:43:34,193 --> 00:43:36,024
Got a light?

388
00:43:37,573 --> 00:43:40,167
All right, there you go.

389
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:06,137
Sir, have you seen Colonel Strayer?

390
00:44:06,482 --> 00:44:09,953
- Where's the company commander?
- Dike? I'm looking.

391
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:13,916
How is it the 4th Army's problem
gets dumped on us?

392
00:44:14,283 --> 00:44:18,482
- Lieutenants. Captain Winters.
- Dike, I've been looking for you.

393
00:44:18,872 --> 00:44:23,264
We've a problem. Colonel Strayer
hasn't returned. You believe that?

394
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:27,185
We're going to the front
and our CO isn't even here.

395
00:44:27,548 --> 00:44:33,261
You've a bigger problem. The men don't
have winter clothing or enough ammo.

396
00:44:33,765 --> 00:44:36,074
Take a canvass of the entire base.

397
00:44:36,393 --> 00:44:40,273
Get all materials before we roll out.
Have you done that?

398
00:44:40,648 --> 00:44:43,561
- No, sir.
- K rations. As many as you can find.

399
00:44:43,902 --> 00:44:45,733
We might not be resupplied.

400
00:44:46,071 --> 00:44:47,789
- And ammo?
- There's no more.

401
00:44:48,073 --> 00:44:51,862
Distribute it as best you can
so everybody has something.

402
00:44:52,537 --> 00:44:55,530
Inform Lieutenant Shames
of the situation.

403
00:44:55,916 --> 00:45:00,388
Get all your platoons as best equipped
as you can and report back.

404
00:45:01,214 --> 00:45:02,408
Captain.

405
00:45:25,827 --> 00:45:29,821
The blackout's not in effect.
Luftwaffe must be asleep.

406
00:45:30,207 --> 00:45:32,721
What a difference a day makes, huh?

407
00:45:35,172 --> 00:45:40,611
- Christ, I miss those C-47s.
- Got a tailgate jump here.

408
00:45:44,724 --> 00:45:47,114
Where are we going with no ammo?

409
00:45:47,436 --> 00:45:49,905
Hey, kid, what's your name again?

410
00:45:50,231 --> 00:45:54,907
- Suerth. Suerth Jr.
- Got any ammo, Junior?

411
00:45:55,321 --> 00:45:59,314
- Just what I'm carrying.
- What about socks? You got extra?

412
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:02,693
- A pair.
- You need four, minimum.

413
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:06,960
Feet, hands, neck, balls,
extra socks warms them all!

414
00:46:07,293 --> 00:46:10,923
We all remember that,
but we didn't remember the socks!

415
00:46:11,256 --> 00:46:13,850
- I want a cigarette.
- I want ammo and socks.

416
00:46:14,176 --> 00:46:17,613
- I bet Junior's got plenty of both.
- I don't.

417
00:46:18,014 --> 00:46:20,482
- How about a hat?
- You got extra ammo?

418
00:46:20,810 --> 00:46:24,280
- What about a coat?
- Shut up with the coat.

419
00:46:24,647 --> 00:46:27,037
- How about some smokes?
- I got that.

420
00:46:27,401 --> 00:46:30,234
- Now you're talking!
- Hook me up!

421
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:33,324
Pass them down! Pass them down!

422
00:46:34,367 --> 00:46:36,245
Keep moving! Come on!

423
00:46:36,578 --> 00:46:38,933
- Go to the left!
- Keep coming!

424
00:46:40,457 --> 00:46:45,293
Keep it moving! All the way down!
Keep moving!

425
00:47:00,064 --> 00:47:03,694
All right, 15 minutes.
Smoke them if you got them.

426
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:10,315
- Where the hell are we?
- We ain't in hell, it's too damn cold.

427
00:47:14,707 --> 00:47:18,098
Stand back, I been holding this
for the last hour!

428
00:47:19,004 --> 00:47:21,472
Anybody got any matches?

429
00:47:28,057 --> 00:47:31,367
Gather round, guys, gather round.

430
00:47:38,361 --> 00:47:40,875
Wait right here. Don't go anywhere.

431
00:47:41,238 --> 00:47:43,514
Welcome to Belgium.

432
00:47:43,867 --> 00:47:47,496
This area is Bastogne,
strategic crossroads town.

433
00:47:47,913 --> 00:47:53,273
Seven roads leading in, seven roads
leading out. ldeal for Kraut armor.

434
00:47:53,712 --> 00:47:57,421
Ike wants to make sure
they can't use those roads.

435
00:47:57,841 --> 00:48:01,596
We'll put a perimeter around Bastogne,
dig in tight.

436
00:48:02,013 --> 00:48:06,724
- 2nd Battalion will be placed here--
- Thank God. Barely made it.

437
00:48:07,186 --> 00:48:09,701
Better get yourself some ODs, Bob.

438
00:48:10,023 --> 00:48:13,333
1 st Battalion's to the north.
3rd's in reserve.

439
00:48:13,695 --> 00:48:16,129
- Let's roll!
- We're short on ammo.

440
00:48:16,447 --> 00:48:18,642
- How short?
- Supply was limited.

441
00:48:18,951 --> 00:48:24,345
Captain, you beg, borrow or steal
ammo, but you defend this area.

442
00:48:35,637 --> 00:48:37,628
Jesus Christ!

443
00:48:41,936 --> 00:48:48,536
- Bill, Don, come here. Look at this.
- What? Hold on. Jesus, I'm done.

444
00:48:52,490 --> 00:48:54,321
What the--?

445
00:49:00,417 --> 00:49:05,048
- What the hell is going on?
- You're going the wrong way.

446
00:49:05,673 --> 00:49:07,265
Hey, pal. Hey, pal--

447
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:10,463
What happened? Where are you going?

448
00:49:10,846 --> 00:49:14,521
They slaughtered us.
You gotta get out of here.

449
00:49:14,933 --> 00:49:17,846
- We just got here.
- Give me your ammo.

450
00:49:18,188 --> 00:49:22,785
- Take it. You'll need it.
- Go on, get out of here.

451
00:49:26,948 --> 00:49:29,143
Holy Christ.

452
00:49:31,037 --> 00:49:33,107
- Who's got ammo?
- Got ammo?

453
00:49:33,414 --> 00:49:38,170
Hold on, give me your ammo.
You got any grenades? Hand them over.

454
00:49:38,587 --> 00:49:41,785
- You got grenades?
- Thanks, buddy.

455
00:49:42,133 --> 00:49:45,284
Got any grenades?
Who's got grenades?

456
00:49:46,347 --> 00:49:48,736
Private, what do you got?

457
00:49:49,058 --> 00:49:51,289
Make a hole!

458
00:49:51,978 --> 00:49:56,894
Make a hole! Make a hole!
I got ammo! Grab what you can!

459
00:49:57,318 --> 00:50:00,708
Lieutenant, you're a godsend.
What's the situation?

460
00:50:01,072 --> 00:50:04,383
I heard you were coming.
There was an ammo dump.

461
00:50:04,743 --> 00:50:08,737
- Is it just you guys in the 101 st?
- Looks like.

462
00:50:09,124 --> 00:50:11,080
- What hit you?
- Everything.

463
00:50:11,376 --> 00:50:13,971
The Krauts had Tigers, Panthers...

464
00:50:14,296 --> 00:50:18,688
...SPs, Stukas.
Arty and infantry just kept on coming.

465
00:50:19,386 --> 00:50:22,185
- What's your name?
- George Rice, 10th Armor.

466
00:50:22,515 --> 00:50:25,632
- Good work.
- Got any more mortar rounds, sir?

467
00:50:26,018 --> 00:50:29,170
I'll make another run,
but don't count on it.

468
00:50:29,565 --> 00:50:32,285
Thank you, sir.
I'll take this.

469
00:50:33,486 --> 00:50:37,081
A panzer division's
about to cut the road south.

470
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:41,249
- Looks like you'll be surrounded.
- We're paratroopers...

471
00:50:41,662 --> 00:50:44,700
- ...we're supposed to be surrounded.
- Good luck.

472
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:46,319
Thanks.
