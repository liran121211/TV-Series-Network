1
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,060
It was a situation there where everybody was happy...

2
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:13,860
...to see the war coming to an end...

3
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,600
...and the Germans didn't really have a heart for it.

4
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:18,800
They realized that the end was there.

5
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:21,300
We'd say the only good Kraut is a dead one.

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,340
But there was something in there that you know, hey that was a kid.

7
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:27,510
Most of them were kids. We all were kids.

8
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:29,910
They had a job to do the same way as me.

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:35,850
So, we went about and did the job that we had to do.

10
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,580
I think we thought that the Germans...

11
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,090
...were probably the evilest people in the world.

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,530
But...

13
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:44,330
...as the war went along...

14
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:48,200
...we found out also that it wasn't the Germans, per se.

15
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,100
A lot of those soldiers...

16
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:51,500
I've thought about this often.

17
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:53,300
That man and I might've been friends.

18
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:55,070
We might have had a lot in common.

19
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,970
He might have liked to fish, you know.

20
00:00:57,050 --> 00:00:58,810
He might have liked to hunt.

21
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,280
You never know, you know.

22
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,410
They were doing what they were supposed to do.

23
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,040
And I was trying to do what I was supposed to do.

24
00:01:05,350 --> 00:01:07,840
But, under different circumstances...

25
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:09,750
...we might have been good friends.

26
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,570
That way.

27
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:39,960
Tell you one thing about the Krauts:

28
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,170
They sure clean up good.

29
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,260
Yeah, all you need's a little Mozart.

30
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,130
Beethoven.

31
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,870
Sorry, sir?

32
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:51,380
That's not Mozart.

33
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:54,410
That's Beethoven.

34
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,030
Come on, chicken.

35
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:17,070
All right, this one's got some, George.

36
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,160
You...

37
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,240
You grab the chicken and I'm gonna grab the eggs.

38
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:22,810
Great, all right.

39
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,380
Just grab him by the foot.

40
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:25,540
Come on, chicken.

41
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:26,980
All right, If this thing bites me...

42
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:28,740
...Frank, I swear I'll shoot it.

43
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,680
Guten Tag, Fraulein.

44
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:35,150
Guten Tag.

45
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,280
Hold on! Hold...

46
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,020
But, George...

47
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,930
I'll be right back.

48
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,400
Hold on a second, hold on.

49
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:43,500
Hey, hey, come on.

50
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,000
I just wanna talk to you.

51
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:52,040
I just wanna talk to you, that's all, I just wanna talk.

52
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:57,050
Okay, look what I got. Chocolate bar?

53
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:59,640
You like that? You like chocolate?

54
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,710
Hey, Luz, why don't you leave her alone?

55
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,220
Frank, why don't you just leave me alone, okay?

56
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:05,350
You don't like chocolate?

57
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:06,450
I don't like it either.

58
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,050
How about this? Cigarettes.

59
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,250
Camel?

60
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,250
Yeah, you like that?

61
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:12,350
Come on, Luz.

62
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:15,330
Frank, please, why don't you go make your omelet?

63
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,130
Well, you ain't getting none of my eggs, blockhead.

64
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:20,960
Jesus, my friend just keeps talking.

65
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,100
Here, I got two packs here.

66
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,300
Give it to your friends or something.

67
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,210
Why don't you come and sit down?

68
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,340
Wanna sit down?

69
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,070
Here?

70
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,610
Come on, that's it.

71
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,220
Hey, Frank, hold on.

72
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:44,650
Perc, Jesus, come on.

73
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:49,290
What?

74
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:00,430
That Captain Nixon?

75
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,530
I think so.

76
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:03,640
What the hell's he doing in his harness?

77
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,700
I don't know.

78
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:06,810
Maybe we jumped into Berlin, the war's over.

79
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:09,980
So, what happened?

80
00:08:10,050 --> 00:08:11,350
No dice with the Fraulein?

81
00:08:11,420 --> 00:08:13,520
No dice. She smacked me in the mouth.

82
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,650
Tell you what, though.

83
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,460
Germany's looking to be pretty good...

84
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:17,990
...fraternizing territory, huh?

85
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,500
Did you lose your cigarettes?

86
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,360
Oh, God.

87
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:22,460
God, ja, ja, ja.

88
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,330
Oh, God.

89
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,870
Hold up, hold up, hold up.

90
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,930
That's right, yeah.

91
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,600
Janovec!

92
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,870
Oh, shit!

93
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,280
Sir.

94
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:39,910
Where's my stuff?

95
00:08:41,350 --> 00:08:43,720
I thought I'd leave it over there, sir.

96
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,370
Over there.

97
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,610
Here.

98
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,060
Thanks.

99
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:22,390
You're welcome, sir.

100
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,370
Oh, sir.

101
00:09:38,510 --> 00:09:39,980
'Morning, sir.

102
00:09:40,110 --> 00:09:41,440
'Morning.

103
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,010
You got a box all this stuff will fit into?

104
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,920
Yes, sir, I think so, same destination?

105
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:48,980
Yeah.

106
00:09:49,060 --> 00:09:50,890
Yes, sir, I'll make sure it goes out...

107
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:52,520
...first thing in the morning.

108
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:53,620
Thank you, Private.

109
00:09:53,690 --> 00:09:57,900
Your folks are gonna have quite a collection by the time you get...

110
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,890
...home, sir.

111
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,160
Finders keepers.

112
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:07,930
Yes, sir.

113
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,130
Nix?

114
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:35,130
Nix?

115
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,260
In here.

116
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,470
Dog.

117
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:47,910
Making combat jumps with the 17th...

118
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:50,450
...while I'm in supply briefings all morning.

119
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:52,740
Yeah, lucky me.

120
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:54,780
No, congratulations.

121
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:57,150
You're probably the only man in the 101st...

122
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,460
...with three combat stars over his jump wings.

123
00:10:59,530 --> 00:11:02,920
Not bad for someone who's never fired his weapon in combat?

124
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:05,200
Really?

125
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,690
Really, you've never...

126
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,500
No.

127
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:11,840
Not even with all the action we've seen?

128
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,570
Not a round.

129
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,140
So...

130
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:24,680
How'd it go this morning, the jump?

131
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:28,310
It was great, fantastic.

132
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,920
We took a direct hit over the drop zone.

133
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,090
I got out. Two others got out.

134
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:38,100
The rest of the boys?

135
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,530
Well, they blew up over Germany somewhere.

136
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,330
Yeah, I'm sorry.

137
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:46,740
About what?

138
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,800
Well, tough situation for the...

139
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,370
Oh, yeah, the boys, yeah.

140
00:11:50,450 --> 00:11:51,710
It's terrible.

141
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:53,470
Oh, well, wasn't me.

142
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,250
You know, the real tragedy is they also lost their CO.

143
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:04,020
So guess who gets to write all the letters home.

144
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:06,520
Goddamn nightmare.

145
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,870
Got a visit from Colonel Sink this morning.

146
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,170
And how is the good colonel?

147
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,440
Concerned.

148
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:30,480
Still drinking nothing but the Vat 69?

149
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:34,420
Only the finest for Mrs. Nixon's baby boy.

150
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,490
Had a problem up at regiment?

151
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,020
What, this?

152
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,430
Is that what he said?

153
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,030
No, I just don't like it up there.

154
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,200
Good, so you'll be happy to hear...

155
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:52,670
...that Sink is transferring you back down to Battalion S-3.

156
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:57,110
What do you think I should write to these parents, Dick?

157
00:12:58,380 --> 00:12:59,580
Hear what I said, Nix?

158
00:12:59,650 --> 00:13:00,640
You've been demoted.

159
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,180
Yeah, demoted, got you.

160
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,510
I don't know how to tell them...

161
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:06,820
...their kids never even got out of the plane.

162
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,920
You tell them what you always tell them:

163
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:10,760
"Their sons died as heroes."

164
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,430
You really still believe that?

165
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,940
Yeah, I do.

166
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,500
Don't you?

167
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,740
"The Cooperative for American Remittance to Europe...

168
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:34,080
"...or CARE, has begun assembling food packages stateside...

169
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:37,420
"...to assist those European families in dire need."

170
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,950
Which is presumably all of them.

171
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:42,520
So, notes home to your family reminding them...

172
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:45,620
...to donate whatever they can would be much appreciated.

173
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:48,870
I'm sure that you'll be happy to know...

174
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:51,160
...Oklahoma's still playing on Broadway.

175
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,940
"Oklahoma where the wind comes sweepin' down the plain

176
00:13:56,510 --> 00:13:59,410
"And the wavin' wheat can sure smell sweet

177
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,910
"When the wind comes

178
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:02,740
"Right behind the rain"

179
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,050
O'Keefe, you were sitting on your bayonet there?

180
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:08,610
Why don't you leave the singing to Luz?

181
00:14:08,690 --> 00:14:10,120
Hey, unless you wanna do...

182
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,520
...Surrey with the Fringe on Top, O'Keefe.

183
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:14,620
Rita Hayworth's getting married.

184
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:16,620
Oh, Rita, say it isn't true.

185
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,930
Abbott and Costello...

186
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:22,130
Wartime news.

187
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,170
"Resistance in the Rhur pocket's crumbling.

188
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,760
"It looks like there might be a breakout in Remagen."

189
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,440
Apparently the Krauts forgot to blow up a bridge...

190
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:31,570
...when they headed back over the Rhine.

191
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:34,800
I guess the boys in the 17th Airborne did okay after all.

192
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,110
Forget it, we'd be in Berlin by now, sir...

193
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:39,150
...if it was us instead of them?

194
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,620
That's right!

195
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:47,890
When do you think we'll jump into Berlin...

196
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,360
...see some real action?

197
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,560
You in a rush?

198
00:14:50,630 --> 00:14:51,720
No.

199
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:55,100
So, you wanna go home with a Congressional Medal of Honor?

200
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:56,190
I just thought I'd ask.

201
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,200
Well, why don't you do us all a favor?

202
00:14:58,270 --> 00:14:59,300
Don't think.

203
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,000
Damn replacements.

204
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:13,210
Hallelujah.

205
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,520
'Bout time.

206
00:15:14,590 --> 00:15:16,060
Yeah, consider yourselves lucky.

207
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:18,920
Nixon was giving another current events lecture.

208
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,790
So, tell me nothing's happening.

209
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:22,160
Nothing's happening.

210
00:15:22,230 --> 00:15:24,160
Couple of artillery rounds at dawn...

211
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,460
...probably from across the river, but...

212
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,500
...that's about it.

213
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,470
It spooked Hashey, though.

214
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,440
Here, Perco, I just finished it.

215
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,170
Oh, yeah? Any sex in it?

216
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,830
Ain't that kind of book.

217
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:40,880
See you. Yeah, see you.

218
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,850
Okay, move on.

219
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,590
Hey, O'Brien.

220
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,800
Relax, would you? I'm trying to read.

221
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,230
It's O'Keefe.

222
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,070
Is that right?

223
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:06,770
Yeah, Patrick O'Keefe.

224
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:08,430
My friends call me Paddy.

225
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,990
Hey, O'Brien.

226
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:28,490
Shut up!

227
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,760
I told you, it's O'Keefe.

228
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:34,860
Do you know why no one remembers your name?

229
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:37,400
It's 'cause no one wants to remember your name.

230
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:40,170
There's too many Smiths, Dimattos and O'Keefes...

231
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:43,810
...and O'Briens, who show up here replacing Toccoa men...

232
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,540
...that you replacements got killed in the first place.

233
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:49,380
And they're all like you. They're all piss and vinegar.

234
00:16:49,450 --> 00:16:50,580
"Where are the Krauts at?"

235
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,620
"Let me at them."

236
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,660
"When will I get to jump into Berlin?"

237
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,420
Two days later, there they are...

238
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,220
...with their guts hanging out...

239
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,230
...and they're screaming for a medic.

240
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:01,130
Begging for their goddamn mother.

241
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,560
Them dumb fucks don't even know they're dead yet.

242
00:17:04,630 --> 00:17:06,470
Hey, are you listening to me?

243
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:09,940
Do you get that this is the best part of fucking war I've seen?

244
00:17:10,010 --> 00:17:13,410
I got hot chow, hot showers, warm bed.

245
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,970
Germany is almost as good as being home.

246
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:18,940
I even got to wipe my ass with real toilet paper today.

247
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,110
Quit asking about when...

248
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,010
...you're gonna see some action, will you?

249
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:24,420
And stop with the fucking love songs!

250
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,540
When'd you ship out?

251
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:49,840
A few weeks ago?

252
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,610
Yeah.

253
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:57,050
It's been two years since I seen home.

254
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,880
Two years.

255
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,830
This fucking war.

256
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:07,060
Neither patrol found a single Kraut.

257
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:08,600
There were none here either.

258
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:10,460
They'll be across the river by now.

259
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,160
Let's send out a night patrol.

260
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:14,900
Check out the embankment on the far side.

261
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,110
President's dead.

262
00:18:21,710 --> 00:18:23,440
Pair of queens bets.

263
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,070
All right, two bucks.

264
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:27,880
Nix.

265
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:31,590
No, I'm out.

266
00:18:31,660 --> 00:18:32,710
All right.

267
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:34,720
Well, I'll call you two...

268
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:38,360
...and I'll raise you another two.

269
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,560
I can't believe we're not gonna drop into Berlin.

270
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,860
No shit.

271
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:45,160
Ike's gonna let the Russkies have it.

272
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:47,100
Russkies.

273
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:49,240
God damn it.

274
00:18:49,310 --> 00:18:50,500
Let me tell you something:

275
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,370
This war is not about fighting anymore.

276
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,110
It's about who gets what.

277
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,840
Why don't you deal me out of the next hand?

278
00:18:57,450 --> 00:18:59,250
What about your money?

279
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:02,480
Are we waiting on him again?

280
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,490
Yep.

281
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,240
Goddamn drugstore.

282
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:06,120
Sir.

283
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:11,550
Hey, guys, wait up.

284
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:13,460
Hey, Dexter, how you doing?

285
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,690
Good to see you.

286
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,230
You know who that was?

287
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:17,960
No.

288
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,880
'Morning.

289
00:20:32,510 --> 00:20:33,380
Captain Nixon.

290
00:20:33,450 --> 00:20:34,640
Good to see you, sir.

291
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,480
I think I have some mail for you.

292
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:39,020
Yeah, I was gonna drop it off this afternoon...

293
00:20:39,090 --> 00:20:41,280
...with all the other 2nd Battalion mail.

294
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,050
But since you're here...

295
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,220
Thanks.

296
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:49,490
Listen, I'm having some trouble finding some whiskey.

297
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:50,330
Whiskey?

298
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,890
Yeah, a particular brand of whiskey.

299
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,130
Vat 69.

300
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,100
Exactly right.

301
00:20:56,170 --> 00:20:57,430
I gotta be honest, sir...

302
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,630
...that ain't gonna be easy to find in Germany.

303
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:01,110
Pickings are kind of slim here.

304
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,540
Yeah, don't I know it?

305
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:04,550
And even if I do find some, sir...

306
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:06,340
...it ain't gonna be cheap.

307
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:07,680
That won't be a problem.

308
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,510
Hey, you hear the news?

309
00:21:09,790 --> 00:21:12,020
Sorry, sir. I didn't realize that you were here.

310
00:21:12,090 --> 00:21:13,050
What news?

311
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,880
300,000 Krauts just surrendered.

312
00:21:15,690 --> 00:21:16,620
Three hundred?

313
00:21:16,690 --> 00:21:19,060
Yeah, we're moving out in an hour.

314
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,820
One hour? Yeah

315
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:24,690
Sir, sir.

316
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,370
Your mail.

317
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,370
Keep looking.

318
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,040
Excuse me, pardon me.

319
00:21:37,610 --> 00:21:39,140
Get a move on, let's go.

320
00:21:42,550 --> 00:21:44,140
Jesus Christ, the dog?

321
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:46,050
Lew?

322
00:21:47,490 --> 00:21:49,220
Cathy's divorcing me.

323
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:50,790
I'm sorry.

324
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,090
She's taking everything.

325
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:57,160
She's taking the house...

326
00:21:57,430 --> 00:21:58,960
...taking the kid.

327
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,640
She's taking the dog.

328
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,030
It's not even her dog!

329
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:03,270
It's my dog!

330
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:05,360
She's taking my dog!

331
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,070
Let's go, load them up, come on!

332
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,520
Sarge, what do you have in here?

333
00:22:21,590 --> 00:22:22,620
Germans?

334
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,360
Hey, Perconte.

335
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,190
You got a lighter?

336
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,360
No, sir, I don't smoke.

337
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:28,490
Hey, where we headed?

338
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:30,470
To the Alps. Let me see that lighter.

339
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,270
The Alps? Yeah.

340
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,460
That near Berlin, sir? No.

341
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:36,770
That's in Bavaria.

342
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,570
Birthplace of national socialism.

343
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,240
So, that mean no drop into Berlin?

344
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:44,070
No drop into Berlin.

345
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:47,840
Hitler ordered the Waffen SS to hide in the mountains and repel all invaders.

346
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,850
He wants them to start a guerrilla war.

347
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,890
Invaders.

348
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:52,990
Damn, I like the sound of that.

349
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:55,180
They'll die the last man trying.

350
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:57,520
Sir. What?

351
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,230
My lighter.

352
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:06,360
All right, nice lighter.

353
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:07,730
Thanks.

354
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:09,270
Waffen SS?

355
00:23:09,510 --> 00:23:11,980
Looks like you'll get your wish anyway, O'Flannery.

356
00:23:12,040 --> 00:23:13,310
Those guys...

357
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,880
Fucking crazy.

358
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,810
It's O'Keefe.

359
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:22,420
"He ain't gonna jump no more

360
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:26,590
"Gory, gory, what a hell of a way to die

00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:01,190
"Gory, gory, what a hell of a way to die

370
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,520
"Gory, gory, what a hell of a way to die"

371
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,430
You okay, Nix?

372
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:05,660
Yeah, I'm fine.

373
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:08,200
"He ain't gonna jump no more"

374
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,320
She hates that dog.

375
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,600
"His blood went spurting high

376
00:24:12,670 --> 00:24:16,610
"His comrades they were heard to say, 'A hell of a way to die'

377
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:20,210
"He laid there rolling 'round in the welter of his gore

378
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:23,980
"He ain't gonna jump no more

379
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:27,880
"Gory, gory, what a hell of a way to die

380
00:24:27,990 --> 00:24:31,790
"Gory, gory, what a hell of a way to die

381
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,220
"Gory, gory, what a hell of a way to die

382
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,290
"He ain't gonna jump no more"

383
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,970
There's gonna be good times, Web.

384
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,370
When we get home, I mean.

385
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,870
First thing I'm gonna do...

386
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,410
...is get my job back at the cab company in Frisco.

387
00:24:52,050 --> 00:24:55,550
Make a killing off all those sailors coming home, you know?

388
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:59,580
Then I'm gonna find me a nice Jewish girl...

389
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:02,050
...with great big, soft titties...

390
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,650
...and a smile to die for.

391
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,990
Marry her.

392
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,720
Then I'm gonna buy a house...

393
00:25:07,790 --> 00:25:10,530
...a big house with lots of bedrooms...

394
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,400
...for all the little Liebgotts we're gonna be making.

395
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,260
She ought to like that.

396
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,130
Hey, Janovec, what you reading?

397
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:20,310
An article.

398
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:21,860
No shit.

399
00:25:22,010 --> 00:25:23,530
What's it about?

400
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:26,550
It's about why we're fighting the war.

401
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:31,470
Why are we fighting the war, Janovec?

402
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,510
It seems that the Germans are bad.

403
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,080
Very bad.

404
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,850
You don't say.

405
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:39,750
The Germans are bad?

406
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:42,420
Hey, Frank, this guy's reading an article over here.

407
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,860
It says the Germans are bad.

408
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,830
So, what about you, Web?

409
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,490
You learn something new every day?

410
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:51,770
I guess I'll finish school first and then...

411
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,530
Wait a minute, finish school?

412
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:58,340
You mean all this time you've been talking about Harvard this...

413
00:25:58,410 --> 00:26:00,570
...and Harvard that, and you ain't even finished?

414
00:26:00,650 --> 00:26:02,710
For one thing I haven't told you anything.

415
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:05,320
Yes, yes, I haven't finished.

416
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,790
So the fuck what?

417
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:09,550
All right, Web, breathe a little. Jesus.

418
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:10,750
Fuck.

419
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,930
It's just the way you always talked, you know?

420
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,860
We all figured that...

421
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:22,130
Hey, you know, you're right.

422
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:23,330
So the fuck what?

423
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:29,870
So, what did you study?

424
00:26:33,650 --> 00:26:35,170
Literature.

425
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:36,620
Get out of here.

426
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,080
You serious?

427
00:26:38,190 --> 00:26:39,710
I love to read.

428
00:26:39,790 --> 00:26:41,420
Do you?

429
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,790
Dick Tracy, Flash Gordon mostly.

430
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,630
Yeah, fuck.

431
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:05,240
Tell her she's got five minutes.

432
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,920
Raus, raus.

433
00:27:15,420 --> 00:27:17,520
Sir, she says they've got nowhere to go...

434
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:19,150
...but the house next door is...

435
00:27:19,230 --> 00:27:20,490
Hey, hey, do you hear this?

436
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,660
He says he ain't a Nazi.

437
00:27:21,730 --> 00:27:23,960
Why haven't I met a Nazi yet in all of Germany?

438
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,000
We're only gonna be here one night.

439
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:28,000
You've got four minutes.

440
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,840
Raus.

441
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:34,040
Come on.

442
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:35,480
Let's go. Move!

443
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:37,200
All of you, out!

444
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:14,050
Look at them.

445
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,180
Even in defeat, they still know how to march with pride.

446
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:35,070
Hey, you!

447
00:28:35,810 --> 00:28:39,140
That's right, you stupid Kraut bastards!

448
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:41,010
That's right!

449
00:28:41,150 --> 00:28:44,640
Say hello to Ford and General fucking Motors.

450
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,450
You stupid fascist pigs.

451
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:48,880
Look at you!

452
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,390
You have horses.

453
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,050
What were you thinking?

454
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,560
That's enough, Webster.

455
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,990
Give it a rest.

456
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,660
Dragging our asses half-way around the world...

457
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:03,200
...interrupting our lives.

458
00:29:03,270 --> 00:29:04,360
For what?

459
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:07,400
You ignorant, servile scum!

460
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:09,410
What the fuck are we doing here?

461
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,630
I wanna send out some patrols.

462
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,360
We'll have Dog here in the village.

463
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:39,130
Easy and Fox in the woods.

464
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:41,100
Easy Company's gonna take the northwest.

465
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,070
Lt. Lipton. Sir.

466
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:43,970
Have 1st and 2nd Platoons go to the woods.

467
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:44,970
Have 3rd swing around.

468
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:46,530
Yes, sir, 1st Sergeant Talbert.

469
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:49,080
You're not worried about an ambush, are you?

470
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,670
No.

471
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:54,170
Just in case we have to stay here for the night.

472
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:14,600
O'Keefe. Sarge

473
00:31:15,170 --> 00:31:17,000
Why the hell are you so jumpy, boy?

474
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:18,100
I'm not jumpy.

475
00:31:18,310 --> 00:31:19,600
I'm fine.

476
00:31:19,670 --> 00:31:22,140
Can hear your heart pounding in Arkansas, boy.

477
00:31:22,210 --> 00:31:25,010
Jesus Christ, give the kid a break, Bull.

478
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:29,010
Hey, George.

479
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:29,950
Yeah?

480
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:32,590
Does this kind of remind you of Bastogne?

481
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,250
Yeah, now that you mention it.

482
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:40,030
Except, of course, there's no snow...

483
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:42,030
...we got warm grub in our bellies...

484
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:46,230
...and the trees aren't fucking exploding from Kraut artillery.

485
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,330
But, yeah, Frank, other than that...

486
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:49,800
...it's a lot like Bastogne.

487
00:31:49,870 --> 00:31:50,960
Right.

488
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:53,610
Bull, smack him for me, please.

489
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,870
Thank you.

490
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:07,880
Hello?

491
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:16,890
Hello?

492
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,360
It sure is quiet.

493
00:33:55,270 --> 00:33:56,760
He is right, fellows.

494
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:13,750
You seen Foley? No.

495
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:14,610
Hey, guys.

496
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:16,380
Any of you see any of the officers?

497
00:35:16,450 --> 00:35:18,920
No, speak to Popeye. Hey Pop.

498
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:21,080
Popeye, you seen any officers? Nixon, Foley?

499
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,060
Speirs is searching them buildings right down the street.

500
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,060
What's the matter?

501
00:35:25,130 --> 00:35:27,490
More, have you seen any of the officers?

502
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:29,990
Yeah, Major Winters is right in there.

503
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:31,660
Are you all right, Frank?

504
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:37,530
Major Winters, sir.

505
00:35:38,540 --> 00:35:39,770
We found something.

506
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:43,000
We're out on patrol and we came across this...

507
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:46,010
What, what, what? Frank, Frank, what is it?

508
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:48,880
I don't know, sir.

509
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,150
I don't know.

510
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:13,800
Major, sir.

511
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:21,840
Open it up.

512
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:23,470
Yes, sir.

513
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:28,880
Stand back.

514
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,520
Give us some room here, stand back.

515
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:35,090
Back, back.

516
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:14,560
Christenson, any of your men speak German?

517
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:16,030
No, sir.

518
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,870
I need Liebgott. Liebgott!

519
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:21,240
Lipton, find me Liebgott.

520
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,070
Yes, sir.

521
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,870
Liebgott, Liebgott!

522
00:38:25,580 --> 00:38:26,640
Liebgott!

523
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:28,710
Major needs you up front, right now.

524
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,840
Sure.

525
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,310
All right, boys.

526
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:33,440
These people need care.

527
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,540
Give them water and all spare rations.

528
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:37,210
Grab me some blankets, quick.

529
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,880
Oh, my God.

530
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:43,260
Dick?

531
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,780
I'm sorry.

532
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:36,540
Here, take some water.

533
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:41,650
Jesus, Web, can you believe this place?

534
00:39:42,890 --> 00:39:44,220
No.

535
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:02,010
It's okay.

536
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:03,640
Better now.

537
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,550
He said the guards left this morning, sir.

538
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:24,020
They burned some of the huts first...

539
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:29,400
...with the prisoners still in them, sir alive.

540
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:30,630
Jesus Christ.

541
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:36,530
Some of the prisoners tried to stop them.

542
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:40,810
Some of them were killed.

543
00:40:45,420 --> 00:40:48,480
They didn't have enough ammo for all the prisoners, so...

544
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,750
...they killed as many as they could...

545
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:57,260
...before they left the camp.

546
00:41:00,770 --> 00:41:03,470
They locked the gates behind them and headed south.

547
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:08,300
Someone in town must have told them we were coming.

548
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:09,780
Yeah, I think so.

549
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,810
Will you ask him...

550
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:18,940
...ask him what kind of camp this is?

551
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,590
What...

552
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:24,190
Why are they here?

553
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:37,070
He says it's a work camp for...

554
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:39,440
Unerwunscht?

555
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:42,270
I'm not sure what the word means, sir.

556
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:46,310
Unwanted, disliked maybe?

557
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:47,540
Criminals?

558
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,650
I don't think criminals, sir.

559
00:41:54,190 --> 00:41:55,420
No.

560
00:41:57,190 --> 00:41:58,890
Doctors, musicians.

561
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:03,490
Tailors, clerks. Farmers, intellectuals. I mean, normal people.

562
00:42:03,570 --> 00:42:05,630
Juden, Juden.

563
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,960
Juden.

564
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:13,370
They're Jews.

565
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:17,540
Poles and gypsies.

566
00:42:33,430 --> 00:42:35,020
Liebgott?

567
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:39,870
The women's camp is at the next railroad stop.

568
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:10,420
Hey, Babe, come here.

569
00:43:13,910 --> 00:43:15,600
Look at their arms.

570
00:43:19,310 --> 00:43:20,470
Like cattle.

571
00:43:20,550 --> 00:43:21,740
Goddamn.

572
00:43:23,250 --> 00:43:24,480
Ah, Jesus.

573
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:45,860
O'Keefe?

574
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:49,090
O'Keefe?

575
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,950
I'm gonna call Sink.

576
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:19,220
Find Speirs and figure out...

577
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,460
...how the hell to get them some food...

578
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,660
...and water.

579
00:45:34,180 --> 00:45:36,670
Let's go, let's pick up the pace, come on.

580
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:40,320
Sergeant Martin...

581
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:42,220
...get what fits on the deuce and a half.

582
00:45:42,290 --> 00:45:43,350
Move, let's move.

583
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,530
Shut up.

584
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:52,560
Take everything, take it all.

585
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,930
Check the back and shut up!

586
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:58,040
Check the back and see if there's any kind of...

587
00:45:58,110 --> 00:46:00,040
Shut up!

588
00:46:04,350 --> 00:46:07,750
I said shut up, you Nazi fuck!

589
00:46:08,620 --> 00:46:09,410
You're not a Nazi?

590
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:11,880
My mistake, you fat fucking prick.

591
00:46:11,950 --> 00:46:13,940
How about a human being? Are you one of those?

592
00:46:14,020 --> 00:46:17,450
Or will you tell me you never smelled the fucking stench?

593
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,500
Let him go, Web.

594
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:25,800
He says he doesn't know what the hell you're talking about.

595
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:32,140
Bullshit.

596
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:49,320
Sergeant Talbert, this is chaos.

597
00:46:49,390 --> 00:46:51,520
There's plenty to go around, please.

598
00:46:58,270 --> 00:47:00,100
We've got more water on the way.

599
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,430
Dick, Major Winters.

600
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:04,100
Yes, sir.

601
00:47:05,910 --> 00:47:07,340
Sir.

602
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,940
This is Doctor Kent, the regimental surgeon.

603
00:47:11,010 --> 00:47:14,010
Doc, tell Major Winters and Captain Nixon what you just told me.

604
00:47:14,080 --> 00:47:17,110
Yes, sir. We need to stop giving these men food right now.

605
00:47:17,190 --> 00:47:18,240
They're starving.

606
00:47:18,390 --> 00:47:20,020
If they eat too much too quickly...

607
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:21,580
...they'll eat themselves to death.

608
00:47:21,660 --> 00:47:22,780
We need to keep them here...

609
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:25,190
...till we can find a place for them in town.

610
00:47:25,260 --> 00:47:27,630
You want us to lock these people back up?

611
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:28,760
We got no choice, Nix.

612
00:47:28,830 --> 00:47:30,090
Otherwise they might scatter.

613
00:47:30,170 --> 00:47:31,500
We must keep them centralized...

614
00:47:31,570 --> 00:47:34,160
...to supervise their food intake and medical treatment.

615
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,570
So, until we find some place better...

616
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:37,900
Colonel Sink.

617
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:41,340
It's a crying ass shame, but let's get it done.

618
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:42,070
Yes, sir.

619
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,270
I don't like it any more than you guys.

620
00:47:46,050 --> 00:47:47,350
General Taylor?

621
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:49,180
Bob Sink, 506.

622
00:47:49,250 --> 00:47:51,150
Sir, we're on, we're at Landsberg...

623
00:47:51,220 --> 00:47:52,880
...the other side of Buchloe.

624
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:56,390
We found something I believe you ought to see, sir.

625
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,920
I can't tell them that, sir.

626
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:02,260
You've got to, Joe.

627
00:48:07,170 --> 00:48:08,230
Yes, sir.

628
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:15,740
Grant, Christenson.

629
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:19,010
The prisoners must be put back in the camp immediately.

630
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,810
Let the men know.

631
00:49:29,150 --> 00:49:30,990
Turns out I'm staying in the only dry...

632
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:32,720
...frigging house in Germany.

633
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:35,660
Thought you weren't drinking the local.

634
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:37,620
Yeah, well.

635
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:40,260
Heard from Division.

636
00:49:42,140 --> 00:49:44,800
Been finding camps like this all over the place.

637
00:49:45,510 --> 00:49:47,000
Jesus.

638
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:51,340
Seems the Russians liberated one a lot worse.

639
00:49:52,210 --> 00:49:53,580
Worse?

640
00:49:53,650 --> 00:49:54,940
Yeah.

641
00:49:55,550 --> 00:49:56,950
Apparently.

642
00:49:57,320 --> 00:49:58,840
Ten times as big.

643
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,050
Execution chambers, ovens.

644
00:50:03,620 --> 00:50:05,590
For cremating all the bodies.

645
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:09,330
Jesus.

646
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:11,500
The locals claim that...

647
00:50:11,570 --> 00:50:13,800
...they never even knew the camp existed.

648
00:50:13,870 --> 00:50:15,460
They say we're exaggerating.

649
00:50:15,870 --> 00:50:19,700
Well, they're gonna have a hell of an education tomorrow.

650
00:50:20,580 --> 00:50:23,600
General Taylor declared martial law about an hour ago.

651
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:25,840
Ordered every able-bodied German in town...

652
00:50:25,910 --> 00:50:28,180
...aged 14 to 80, to start burying the bodies.

653
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:29,940
That'll begin in the morning.

654
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,550
10th Armored are gonna supervise cleanup.

655
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:34,110
What about us?

656
00:50:34,190 --> 00:50:36,590
We head out for...

657
00:50:36,760 --> 00:50:39,750
...Thalheim, Thalheim, tomorrow.

658
00:50:39,830 --> 00:50:41,660
1200 hours.

659
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:08,010
Kerchief, sir?

660
00:51:08,090 --> 00:51:08,890
What?

661
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:11,150
No, thanks.

662
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:15,930
Move along.

663
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:18,090
Over there.

664
00:52:14,290 --> 00:52:15,780
Don't stop. Keep digging.

665
00:52:15,860 --> 00:52:17,850
You, too. Come on.

666
00:53:15,620 --> 00:53:17,140
Hitler's dead.

667
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:19,720
Holy shit.

668
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:21,260
Shot himself in Berlin.

669
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:24,720
Is the war over, sir?

670
00:53:25,600 --> 00:53:26,890
No.

671
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,200
We have orders to Berchtesgaden.

672
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:32,860
We're gonna move out in one hour.

673
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:35,130
Why, the man's not home?

674
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,470
Should've killed himself three years ago.

675
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:41,980
Saved us a lot of trouble.

676
00:53:42,910 --> 00:53:44,850
Yeah, he should've...

677
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:49,750
...but he didn't.
