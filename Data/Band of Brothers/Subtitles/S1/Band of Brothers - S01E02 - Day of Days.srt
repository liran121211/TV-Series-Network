1
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:35,195
Yup. Standing in the door, I could see...

2
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:37,406
...the lights on a drop zone.

3
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:42,744
And I had to assume that was
our drop zone way in the-- Ahead of us.

4
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:45,539
And...

5
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:48,917
So that-- We had-- Had the red light.

6
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:52,921
I had everybody standing up,
ready to jump.

7
00:02:53,089 --> 00:02:57,092
So when the plane started
to get hit, and suddenly...

8
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:01,430
...the pilot gives me the green light,
I'm out the door immediately.

9
00:03:01,598 --> 00:03:06,685
Got such an opening blast from the--
Or opening shot from the prop blast...

10
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:11,899
...that it broke this chinstrap
that we had on this helmet liner.

11
00:03:12,066 --> 00:03:17,196
And that's when I lost this famous leg bag
that everybody talks about.

12
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:23,076
Just from the shock of the opening,
it just flew right off my foot.

13
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:25,787
We came from the sky.

14
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:32,294
We hit, and in any direction you went,
there would be enemy. You knew it.

15
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:36,048
And that was all part of--
Of what you accepted.

16
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:39,968
How do you prepare yourself mentally?

17
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:43,138
Each man must do that himself.

18
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:47,309
Each man must prepare
himself mentally...

19
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:50,437
...to-- To make that jump.

20
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:52,314
In the back of your mind, you--
You know...

21
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,733
...you wonder what's gonna happen
and all that.

22
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:57,986
You know you've-- You've been
trained and trained and trained...

23
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:02,282
...and what your job is gonna be
and what you're supposed to do and--

24
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,993
Oh, that's what you gotta think about.
You know?

25
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:08,413
And we lost a lot of people that night.

26
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:14,544
But you try to put it all
out of your mind.

27
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,351
Smith!

28
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,229
Give me a light.

29
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:47,095
Lip! Did Evans make it?

30
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:52,225
Yes, sir.
He's in Lieutenant Meehan's stick, sir.

31
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:03,612
Lieutenant Meehan. Lieutenant Meehan.

32
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,782
Bill could use some help.

33
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,124
Bill!

34
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:19,294
Bill, hey! Bill!
I need your help here.

35
00:07:33,202 --> 00:07:35,871
<i>Oh, no. Flying Arado on the wing.</i>

36
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:39,791
<i>I repeat, we got a</i>
<i>temperature on the wing.</i>

37
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:53,346
Get ready!

38
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:55,849
Stand up!

39
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:58,977
Hook up!

40
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:04,065
Equipment check!

41
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,531
- Sound off for equipment check!
- Ten okay!

42
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,742
- Nine okay!
- Eight okay!

43
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,577
- Seven okay!
- Six okay!

44
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,412
- Five okay!
- Four okay!

45
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:19,581
- Three okay!
- Two okay!

46
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,082
One okay!

47
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,888
Fuck!

48
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,120
Jesus Christ! Let's go, let's go!

49
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:02,541
- Does that light look green to you?
- Let's go! Let's go!

50
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,210
I'm hit!

51
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:20,725
Jesus! Tell Meehan
to get them out of there!

52
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:33,947
Two o'clock!

53
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:36,283
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
- Hold it steady!

54
00:10:01,642 --> 00:10:03,268
- Go!
- Come on and jump, sir!

55
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,769
Don't listen to me.

56
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,104
- He's staying on the plane!
- Move!

57
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,149
You're not jumping.

58
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:12,861
- He's okay! Go, sir! Go!
- All right!

59
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:15,488
Son of a bitch.

60
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:30,420
Where's the goddamn DZ?

61
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:35,634
- Maybe three more minutes on this bearing!
- We get any lower, we ain't gonna need...

62
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,719
...any frigging parachutes!

63
00:10:37,928 --> 00:10:41,056
- Slow down!
- We gotta get some altitude!

64
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:44,184
But they can't jump at this speed!

65
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:46,561
We there?

66
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,855
Oh, God!

67
00:10:49,023 --> 00:10:50,732
Oh, no!

68
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,987
Let's go!

69
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:47,622
- Flash.
- Shit.

70
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:50,291
I don't think that's the correct reply,
trooper.

71
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:55,922
- I say "flash," you say "thunder."
- Yes, sir. Thunder, sir.

72
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:01,636
Musette bag.

73
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:08,768
Coach? Sir, it's Hall, sir.
I was on the basketball team.

74
00:12:08,936 --> 00:12:11,396
- Leg bag?
- Prop blast got it, sir.

75
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:15,316
- And my radio and batteries with it.
- Mine too.

76
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:18,987
It landed somewhere behind those trees.

77
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:22,824
Okay.

78
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:25,994
Follow me.

79
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:34,586
Hell with that!

80
00:12:56,525 --> 00:12:59,152
Wait until they reload.

81
00:13:01,697 --> 00:13:03,865
Go.

82
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:11,164
- Aren't you D Company?
- Able, sir.

83
00:13:12,082 --> 00:13:14,667
Guess that means one of us
is in the wrong drop zone, sir.

84
00:13:14,835 --> 00:13:18,087
Yeah, or both of us.

85
00:13:19,089 --> 00:13:23,176
- Do you have a weapon, sir?
- Just my knife.

86
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:28,848
Do you have any idea
where we are, sir?

87
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,394
Some.

88
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:38,691
- So you're a radioman.
- Yes, sir.

89
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,486
Well, I was until I lost my radio
on the jump.

90
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:44,030
I'm sure I'll get chewed out for that.

91
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:46,282
Well, if you were in my platoon...

92
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:50,078
...I'd tell you, you were a rifleman first
and a radioman second.

93
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,288
Well, maybe you could tell that
to my platoon leader.

94
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,458
When we find him. If we find him.

95
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,377
It's a deal.

96
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:03,216
First, I need your help. Locate some
landmarks to get our bearings.

97
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:07,387
Keep your eyes peeled
for buildings, farmhouses...

98
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:12,267
...bridges, roads, trees.

99
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,398
I wonder if the rest of them
are as lost as we are.

100
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:23,027
We're not lost, private.
We're in Normandy.

101
00:15:00,441 --> 00:15:05,486
- Who's that?
- Lieutenant Winters? Is that you?

102
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:09,365
Sit down, down here.

103
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:12,076
- Sit down. Any weapon?
- No, sir.

104
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:16,581
As soon as I hit that prop blast, so long
leg bag. All I got is this knife and some TNT.

105
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,584
- These 82nd boys got their M-1 s though.
- Oh, man. 82nd?

106
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:23,087
- Where the hell are we?
- Sir, I saw a sign back thataways.

107
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:26,257
It said "Sainte-Mère-Église."

108
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,641
Flashlight?

109
00:15:35,017 --> 00:15:36,100
Raincoat?

110
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:39,437
- You got a raincoat?
- Yeah, yeah.

111
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,629
We're about 7 kilometers
away from our objective.

112
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:07,382
And four hours away from
when we need to have it secured.

113
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:11,678
So we got a lot of walking
ahead of us.

114
00:16:11,845 --> 00:16:14,847
You men'll stick with us
until we find your unit.

115
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:16,891
Let's go.

116
00:16:17,059 --> 00:16:20,061
- Hey, sarge, where are we going?
- Causeway Number 2, Utah Beach.

117
00:16:20,229 --> 00:16:21,688
The Germans flooded the fields inland.

118
00:16:21,855 --> 00:16:23,982
We don't clear those roads,
our boys ain't going nowhere.

119
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:27,777
The five of us ain't gonna secure a road.
That looey don't even have a weapon.

120
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:32,323
I don't remember hearing
about any rail roads near our objective.

121
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:35,868
I'm telling you, this is the spur line
that runs parallel to the river.

122
00:16:36,036 --> 00:16:37,829
We should be coming up
to a road and bridge ahead.

123
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,080
Yeah, how would you know?

124
00:16:39,248 --> 00:16:42,583
Because I studied
the sand tables, all right?

125
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:49,382
- Probably a frigging train or--
- Shh.

126
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,301
- Flash.
- Thunder.

127
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,179
Lieutenant, is that you?

128
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,098
- Malarkey.
- Sir. Sir.

129
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:58,933
- Glad to see you, sir.
- Hey, fellas.

130
00:16:59,101 --> 00:17:00,101
- Hey, fellas.
- Hey, everybody okay?

131
00:17:00,269 --> 00:17:01,269
- How are you?
- Good to see you.

132
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:02,311
- Nice to see you.
- Get moving.

133
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,896
- Guarnere?
- Sir.

134
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:06,899
You and Hall up front.

135
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,402
Who the hell is Hall?

136
00:17:41,852 --> 00:17:45,605
Lipton. Go. Guarnere.

137
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:08,503
Wait for my command.

138
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:33,319
Grenade! Grenade!

139
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:53,965
That's enough, Guarnere!

140
00:18:55,467 --> 00:18:59,137
- Everyone okay?
- Yes, sir.

141
00:18:59,888 --> 00:19:05,393
Next time I say wait for my command,
you wait for my command, sergeant.

142
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,687
Yes, sir.

143
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:17,738
Here you go, lieutenant. Kraut weapon.

144
00:19:20,951 --> 00:19:23,744
Fine, Quaker.

145
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,043
- What's that guy's problem?
- Gonorrhea.

146
00:19:31,211 --> 00:19:32,420
Really?

147
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:36,007
His name, dummy.
Guarnere, gonorrhea, get it?

148
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:39,343
So besides having a shitty name,
what's his problem?

149
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:42,513
None of your fucking business, cowboy.

150
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:45,766
- All right, let's move out.
- Yes, sir.

151
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:48,269
Quietly.

152
00:20:05,287 --> 00:20:09,373
- You see him? He just sat there.
- He didn't have a weapon.

153
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:13,711
- What's he gonna do, shout at them?
- He shouts at me for killing Krauts.

154
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,797
He just wanted you
to wait for his command.

155
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:19,425
Joe, he don't even drink.

156
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,779
Lipton! Wynn!

157
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:23,155
Anybody who needs supplies or ammo,
now's the time to get it.

158
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:29,829
McDowell! You okay?

159
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:32,540
- Yes, sergeant.
- Well, let's go.

160
00:21:42,384 --> 00:21:44,885
Hey, I promised my kid brother
I'd fetch him back a Luger.

161
00:21:45,053 --> 00:21:49,098
So I got first dibs, okay?
Check that one.

162
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,520
It's the Navy.

163
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:55,896
The landings have started. Let's go.

164
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:58,190
- Let's move it out.
- Right on time.

165
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:01,819
- Yeah? Tell that to him, cowboy.
- My name's Hall.

166
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,072
- That so?
- Let's move out.

167
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:08,909
- You just gotta learn to return his fire, is all.
- You just gotta realize it ain't about you.

168
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:12,913
- I just heard his brother--
- Malarkey, shut your yap.

169
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:17,918
His brother got it at Cassino.
Found out before we jumped.

170
00:22:31,099 --> 00:22:32,516
Morning, sir.

171
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:35,061
Battalion sure will be happy
to see you guys.

172
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,271
- Where?
- At the farm, sir.

173
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:41,275
Top of the morning to you, fellas.
Enjoying the war?

174
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,778
Where you from, son?

175
00:22:44,571 --> 00:22:47,198
Eugene, Oregon.

176
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:50,117
Eugene? You gotta be kidding me.

177
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:53,454
Popeye, did you hear this?
I'm from Astoria.

178
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:57,249
- You don't say.
- Yeah. Orange Street.

179
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,794
What gives?
What are you doing in a Kraut uniform?

180
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:05,716
- Come again?
- My family answered the call.

181
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,969
All true Aryans should return
to the Fatherland.

182
00:23:09,137 --> 00:23:11,972
- Joined up in '41.
- You're shitting me, right?

183
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:17,436
Hey, Malarkey! Stop fraternizing
with the enemy! Get over here!

184
00:23:17,604 --> 00:23:20,648
- What--? What got you to Eugene?
- I was born in Eugene.

185
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,316
Really?

186
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:36,997
Popeye.

187
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,667
Hey, Popeye!

188
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:43,295
- Hey, Harry!
- Carry on.

189
00:23:43,463 --> 00:23:46,006
- Easy Company.
- Bill!

190
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,843
- Popeye. Good to see you.
- Good to see you.

191
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:52,680
- And this here's Hall, Able Company.
- Known as Cowboy.

192
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,807
- You from Texas?
- Manhattan.

193
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,934
Lieutenant Winters!

194
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:59,687
- Hey, fellas, how you doing?
- What's going on?

195
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,981
- What's the holdup?
- I'm not sure.

196
00:24:02,732 --> 00:24:04,733
Five'll get you ten
it's got something to do with that.

197
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:06,152
Yeah.

198
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,362
It's good to see you, Dick.

199
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:11,365
Yeah, you too, Buck.
What's the situation?

200
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:15,536
Oh, not good. Ninety percent of
the men are still unaccounted for.

201
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,413
- Lieutenant Meehan?
- No, no one's seen him...

202
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:21,333
...or anyone from his plane.
You know, if he is missing...

203
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:26,005
...wouldn't that put you in line
to be the next commander of Easy?

204
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:31,552
Hey, Lieutenant Speirs.

205
00:24:33,054 --> 00:24:35,806
How many men of Dog Company
got assembled?

206
00:24:35,974 --> 00:24:39,477
- Handful, maybe 20.
- You the only officer that made it?

207
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,687
So far.

208
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:46,150
Still waiting for orders.
You got some cigarettes?

209
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:48,402
Yeah.

210
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,197
Hey, keep the pack.

211
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:54,033
Yeah, so I was in the plant in '39.

212
00:24:54,201 --> 00:24:56,911
That's when I was at Monarch
tooling propeller shafts.

213
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:59,163
No kidding. What are the chances
of that, huh?

214
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:03,334
You and me, 100 miles from each other,
working at practically the same job. Jeez.

215
00:25:03,502 --> 00:25:07,213
- Hey, Malark! We're waiting on you.
- Yeah, I'm coming.

216
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,757
Well, I gotta run. I'll see you around.

217
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:14,053
Yeah, see you around.

218
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,860
Here you go.

219
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:42,289
Thank you.

220
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,051
Shit.

221
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,470
<i>Easy Company?</i>

222
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,639
Easy?

223
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:02,434
Hey, any of you guys know
where Easy Company is?

224
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:05,813
- You seen Lieutenant Meehan?
- No, not yet.

225
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:09,984
Well, Major Strayer wants
Easy Company's CO up front.

226
00:26:10,151 --> 00:26:12,319
- Well, I guess that means you, Dick.
- Come on.

227
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:14,405
Son of a bitch.

228
00:26:16,783 --> 00:26:20,452
Hey, Malark, where's the best chow?

229
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:22,997
In Berlin.

230
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:30,087
- Let's round them up.
- Okay. I'll get at them.

231
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:33,007
And the MGs?
I'd say right around here, sir.

232
00:26:33,174 --> 00:26:35,509
But I can't be sure.

233
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,095
There's some Kraut 88s up ahead.

234
00:26:38,263 --> 00:26:40,848
Up ahead and to the right about,
what, 300 yards?

235
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:44,852
Up through those gardens. Now, they're
right between us and Causeway Number 2.

236
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,563
Firing onto the boys landing at Utah.

237
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,690
- Think Easy can handle it?
- Yes, sir.

238
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:53,902
Because my guess is, they're doing
some terrible damage there.

239
00:26:54,404 --> 00:26:58,032
Yeah. Sir, does the major know
we only have 12 Easy Company men?

240
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,200
No, it didn't come up.

241
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:04,705
The 88s we've been hearing
have been spotted in a field...

242
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,207
...down the road a ways.

243
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:10,127
Major Strayer wants us
to take them out.

244
00:27:10,295 --> 00:27:14,381
There are two guns that we know of
firing on Utah Beach.

245
00:27:14,549 --> 00:27:17,134
And plan on a third and a fourth...

246
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:20,971
...here and here.
The Germans are in the trenches...

247
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:25,976
...with access to the entire battery.
With machine gun covering the rear.

248
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,728
We'll establish a base of fire...

249
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:31,231
...and move under it hard and fast
with two squads of three.

250
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:34,276
How many Krauts
they think we're facing?

251
00:27:34,444 --> 00:27:38,572
- No idea.
- No idea?

252
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:43,994
We'll take some TNT along with us.
Despite the guns.

253
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,246
- Lipton, your responsibility.
- Yes, sir.

254
00:27:46,456 --> 00:27:50,376
Liebgott, you'll take the first machine gun,
with Petty A-gunner.

255
00:27:50,543 --> 00:27:54,463
Plesha, Hendrix, you take the other.
Who does that leave?

256
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:58,884
Compton, Malarkey,
Toye, Guarnere. Okay.

257
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:02,388
We'll be making the main assault.
Understood?

258
00:28:02,555 --> 00:28:03,764
Yes, sir.

259
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:06,100
All right, let's pack it up, boys.

260
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:10,270
Shouldn't you be outside
with the other Able Company guys?

261
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,023
See you around, Hall.

262
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:21,115
Lipton, when you see
we've captured the first gun...

263
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,450
...I want you and your TNT
as fast as possible.

264
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:24,785
Yes, sir.

265
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:29,707
Okay. Just weapons and ammo,
drop everything else.

266
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:33,377
Got any spare ammo in a pack
or a musette bag, bring it along.

267
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:37,715
Lieutenant, sir? I was wondering,
sir, you need an extra hand?

268
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:40,467
- Ain't you Sink's jeep driver?
- So?

269
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:41,760
Oh, shit.

270
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:44,054
What's your name, trooper?

271
00:28:44,305 --> 00:28:47,266
- Lorraine, sir.
- You're with me, Lorraine.

272
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:49,435
- Compton, second squad.
- Yes, sir!

273
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,979
All right, you heard the word.
Let's move! Let's move!

274
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,656
Fire!

275
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:31,351
Go.

276
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,606
Three cannons.

277
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:44,990
Petty, we've got enfilading fire.

278
00:29:45,158 --> 00:29:48,202
All right, let's go. Stay down.

279
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,090
MG42s.

280
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:05,719
I'll draw their fire to the right from
the truck. Take two men and hit them...

281
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,888
- ...from the left. Okay, go.
- Right.

282
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:19,399
Take Ranney, envelop right, give covering
fire. Lorraine, on the machine gun.

283
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:21,860
Don't give away your position
until you have to.

284
00:30:22,028 --> 00:30:25,405
And I want that TNT as soon as
you see we've captured the first gun.

285
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,533
- Go.
- Yes, sir.

286
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:46,635
Go.

287
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,644
I can't see nothing.

288
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,613
Come on, Buck.

289
00:32:14,682 --> 00:32:15,974
Shit!

290
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:23,148
Let's go! Let's go!

291
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:25,609
Follow me!

292
00:32:34,702 --> 00:32:36,828
Come on.

293
00:32:38,665 --> 00:32:42,209
Fuck! My ass!

294
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:48,131
I'm sorry, sir.

295
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:53,261
Jesus Christ!

296
00:32:57,350 --> 00:32:59,059
Fucking jeep jockey.

297
00:32:59,268 --> 00:33:04,189
Shit! I'm sorry, sir. I screwed up.

298
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,235
Grenade!

299
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:11,238
Joe! Toye! Roll on! Roll on!

300
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,824
Get off!

301
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:16,535
Shoot!

302
00:33:16,703 --> 00:33:18,912
One lucky bastard, Joe.

303
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:31,258
Guarnere! Malarkey! Lorraine!
Secure that gun!

304
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:37,389
- Compton, covering fire!
- Yes, sir!

305
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:51,945
- Where you hit, Pop?
- I can't believe I fucked up my ass, sir.

306
00:33:52,113 --> 00:33:54,364
Your ass?

307
00:33:56,367 --> 00:33:58,035
- Oh, shit.
- Hey, Popeye, how bad is it?

308
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:03,915
I'm sorry, sir. I didn't mean to fuck up.
I don't-- I don't think it's too bad.

309
00:34:04,083 --> 00:34:05,959
Son of a bitch.
Think you can make it back yourself?

310
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:09,629
- I think so, sir.
- Let's move out.

311
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:14,301
All right, here we go. Drop your weapon,
Pop, drop your weapon. Come on.

312
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,970
One, two, three!

313
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,847
Get down, Dick, get down!

314
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:22,142
Pop!

315
00:34:22,351 --> 00:34:24,811
Popeye! Get down!

316
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:29,649
Winters! One o'clock!

317
00:34:29,817 --> 00:34:31,068
Grenade!

318
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:36,156
Toye! Let's go! Get out of there!
Get out of there!

319
00:34:36,324 --> 00:34:38,492
Toye!

320
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,995
- Joe!
- Jesus Christ.

321
00:34:42,163 --> 00:34:45,123
Fucking twice.

322
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,670
Jesus Christ!

323
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:54,633
Lorraine! Move! Go!

324
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,094
Malark!

325
00:35:03,267 --> 00:35:06,353
Ranney! Let's move!
They got the first gun!

326
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,947
There's the second gun.
Grenades first.

327
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:19,032
- Then keep going. Go!
- Right.

328
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,541
Okay.

329
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,294
Go!

330
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,221
Shut up.

331
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:43,473
- No make dead.
- Shut up.

332
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:47,060
- Shut the fuck up!
- No make dead.

333
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:55,694
Toye, stay down.
Stay down!

334
00:35:55,862 --> 00:35:59,406
- Compton!
- All right. Cover for me.

335
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,034
We must be doing something right.
Look...

336
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:05,245
...we got them so confused,
they're firing on the third gun.

337
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:07,998
We better blow this thing before
they figure out what the hell's happening.

338
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:13,211
- I'm gonna go and see what's keeping Lipton.
- All right. Toye! Cover the lieutenant!

339
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:18,925
- I think one of those dead Krauts has a Luger!
- So what?

340
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:21,761
Keep your head low, Petty.
Come on, move it!

341
00:36:21,929 --> 00:36:24,347
Have a little suppressing fire,
why don't you?

342
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:26,725
Jesus Christ!

343
00:36:26,893 --> 00:36:29,352
Malarkey!

344
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,939
- Now you stop firing? Beautiful.
- Stay low!

345
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,149
Shit.

346
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,276
Christ, they must think
he's a medic or something.

347
00:36:36,485 --> 00:36:38,612
He's gonna need a goddamn medic.

348
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:41,031
Okay, okay, okay.

349
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,241
Malarkey!

350
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:47,954
- Stay low!
- What the hell's he doing?

351
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,789
Come on!

352
00:36:54,879 --> 00:37:00,592
Forgot your frigging Luger? Want I
should go get it for you, you stupid mick?

353
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:06,806
- Where's Lipton with that TNT?
- Don't know, sir.

354
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:09,142
- You'll be all right, Popeye.
- I'm sorry. I messed up.

355
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,727
- Don't be sorry.
- Hey, sarge?

356
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:13,396
- Yeah?
- You think this is a ticket home?

357
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:17,025
- Maybe.
- Shit, I just got here.

358
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:24,491
Hiya, Cowboy!

359
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:28,036
Shut your fucking guinea trap,
Gonorrhea.

360
00:37:28,204 --> 00:37:29,204
He's all right, that kid.

361
00:37:29,372 --> 00:37:31,414
Jesus, you got a whole
Kraut platoon out there.

362
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:33,750
- Probably more, captain.
- You need help?

363
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:38,004
I need ammo, sir! Lots of it. And TNT!

364
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:42,676
- I've got TNT, sir!
- Good job, private!

365
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:49,349
Jesus.

366
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:51,142
Hall! Ready?

367
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:54,104
Sir, I don't have any way
to set it off, sir.

368
00:38:11,998 --> 00:38:14,958
Fire in the hole!

369
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:22,132
Plesha! Covering fire. Third gun here.

370
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:24,217
Lorraine, grab some more
of those potato mashers...

371
00:38:24,385 --> 00:38:28,680
...and follow me!
Malarkey, Hall, you two. Go!

372
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:50,243
- Running a little low on ammo, sir!
- How about you, Malarkey?

373
00:38:50,411 --> 00:38:52,412
Okay.

374
00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:54,414
Think you got enough
to take the third gun?

375
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,042
We'll soon find out, Dick.
Malarkey, let's go!

376
00:38:57,209 --> 00:38:59,419
Toye! Cover!

377
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:00,754
Okay, Hall.

378
00:39:00,921 --> 00:39:03,173
Keep your head down!

379
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:07,427
Hall! Leave your TNT!

380
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:16,603
Fire in the hole!

381
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:26,613
Malarkey, cover the front.
Go to the cannon. Go!

382
00:39:57,812 --> 00:40:00,730
Hey, sarge, I'm looking
for Battalion Headquarters!

383
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:03,775
Are you kidding? It's back thataway!

384
00:40:03,943 --> 00:40:06,069
You mean over--?

385
00:40:08,322 --> 00:40:11,074
Fire in the hole!

386
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,796
TNT!

387
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:27,674
- TNT!
- Don't need it!

388
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,635
- What?
- Don't need it!

389
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:35,598
- Hall!
- Hall?!

390
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:39,269
Where'd he come from?

391
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:44,858
Winters! Hester said you needed ammo.

392
00:40:45,025 --> 00:40:49,863
Malarkey!
As much as you can, everyone.

393
00:40:50,197 --> 00:40:53,199
You mind if D Company
takes a shot at the next gun?

394
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:56,327
- All yours!
- Let's go, Dog Company!

395
00:40:56,495 --> 00:41:00,373
- Up and at them, D Company!
- Compton!

396
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:03,543
- Who is that, Speirs?
- Out! Get out!

397
00:41:08,883 --> 00:41:11,468
What's he doing out of the trench?

398
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:14,679
- Now what the hell's he doing?
- Too late!

399
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,390
Oh, Jesus.

400
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:22,687
Sir!

401
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:26,733
Had a little trouble getting
through that first field.

402
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,695
- Oh, Christ.
- We're gonna need it at the next gun.

403
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:33,823
- Once it's blown, tell them to pull out. Go!
- Yes, sir.

404
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:41,873
Compton, police them up,
and pull out! Lorraine! Toye! Move out!

405
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,509
Move out! Move out! Move it out!

406
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:53,927
MGs first.

407
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:57,597
Fall back to your original positions.

408
00:41:57,765 --> 00:42:01,684
Everyone else,
maintain your base of fire.

409
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:09,943
Okay! Back to battalion! Go! Go!

410
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:23,957
They were 105s, not 88s, sir.
We disabled them and pulled out.

411
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,333
I figure there's maybe...

412
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:29,128
...40 or so Krauts still manning
three MG42s to the rear.

413
00:42:29,296 --> 00:42:30,380
- Hey, Popeye.
- Watch it. Watch it.

414
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,548
Coming through!

415
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,300
- Forty?
- Yes, sir.

416
00:42:34,468 --> 00:42:37,095
We killed maybe around 20, so...

417
00:42:37,263 --> 00:42:39,764
...yeah, probably there's 40 left.

418
00:42:39,932 --> 00:42:44,811
I think we need artillery
or maybe mortars might do the job.

419
00:42:57,324 --> 00:42:59,993
- Going my way?
- Sure.

420
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,579
Sir.

421
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:06,499
Careful, don't hurt yourself.

422
00:43:06,667 --> 00:43:10,587
- Nice ride you got here, Nix.
- Straight from Utah Beach.

423
00:43:10,754 --> 00:43:14,340
We should put them to work
before they're missed.

424
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:24,309
<i>By nightfall, 2nd Battalion</i>
<i>had secured Sainte-Marie-du-Mont.</i>

425
00:43:24,476 --> 00:43:29,897
<i>And elements of the 4th Division were</i>
<i>beginning to move men and material inland.</i>

426
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:35,486
<i>Most of the 101 st Airborne,</i>
<i>including Easy Company...</i>

427
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:37,530
<i>...were still scattered all over Normandy.</i>

428
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:40,199
<i>And the success of the invasion</i>
<i>was far from certain.</i>

429
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:43,328
<i>We had an hour to rest and</i>
<i>scrounge whatever food we could...</i>

430
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:48,291
<i>...before we had to move south</i>
<i>and secure the town of Culoville.</i>

431
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:51,419
Move it! Move it out!

432
00:43:51,587 --> 00:43:53,880
I don't wanna die in
the back of this damn truck, is what.

433
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,840
Come on, you're stepping on my legs!

434
00:43:56,008 --> 00:44:00,303
- Jesus, let me out of here.
- Light. Light discipline.

435
00:44:00,471 --> 00:44:02,472
Guarnere, close that flap.

436
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,683
Let the Krauts cook
their own goddamn food.

437
00:44:06,226 --> 00:44:08,144
- How we doing, Malark?
- We're doing good.

438
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,312
- Doing good?
- Yeah.

439
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:11,189
What the hell do you know about cooking?
You're Irish.

440
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:15,943
Sir, if you have a reservation someplace
else, I'd be happy to go with you.

441
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:20,365
- Thank you.
- Shit.

442
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:28,581
- I'm sorry. Oh, God.
- Jesus Christ, give me some air.

443
00:44:34,963 --> 00:44:37,507
Oh, God.

444
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,259
- Evening.
- Hello, sir.

445
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:44,889
- Something die in here?
- Yeah, Malarkey's ass.

446
00:44:46,266 --> 00:44:50,436
- Any word on Lieutenant Meehan yet, sir?
- No, not yet.

447
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:56,109
Don't that make you
our commanding officer, sir?

448
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:58,069
Yeah, it does.

449
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:05,034
- Sir.
- Joe, the lieutenant don't drink.

450
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,956
It's been a day of firsts.

451
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,588
Don't you think, Guarnere?

452
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,136
Yes, sir.

453
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,139
Carry on.

454
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:28,057
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, sir.

455
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:31,269
- Oh, sergeant?
- Sir.

456
00:45:31,437 --> 00:45:34,564
I'm not a Quaker.

457
00:45:37,317 --> 00:45:38,443
Being from Lancaster County...

458
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,820
- He's probably a Mennonite.
- What's a Mennonite?

459
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:47,326
Hey!

460
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:48,911
- Dick!
- Hey, wait up!

461
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,997
- What?
- You know that map you found?

462
00:45:51,165 --> 00:45:53,207
That had every Kraut gun in Normandy
on it.

463
00:45:53,375 --> 00:45:55,293
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

464
00:45:56,670 --> 00:45:58,838
Here.

465
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:03,092
Don't ever get a cat.

466
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,678
What's on your mind?

467
00:46:05,846 --> 00:46:08,514
I lost a man today.

468
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:10,183
Hall.

469
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:14,020
Thanks. A John Hall. New Yorker.

470
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:16,689
Got killed today at Brecourt.

471
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:20,193
- I-- I never knew him.
- Yeah, you did.

472
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:24,614
Radio op. 506 basketball team,
Able Company.

473
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:28,201
He was a good man.

474
00:46:28,368 --> 00:46:32,872
Man. Not even old enough to buy a beer.

475
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,587
I'm not hungry.

476
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:43,174
Hey, Dick.

477
00:46:44,092 --> 00:46:46,677
I sent that map up to Division.

478
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:49,889
I think it's gonna do some good.

479
00:47:31,139 --> 00:47:36,394
<i>That night I took time to thank</i>
<i>God for seeing me through that day of days.</i>

480
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:40,439
<i>And prayed I would make</i>
<i>it through D-plus-1 .</i>

481
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:45,278
<i>And if somehow I managed</i>
<i>to get home again...</i>

482
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:48,447
<i>...I promised God and myself...</i>

483
00:47:48,657 --> 00:47:52,451
<i>...that I would find</i>
<i>a quiet piece of land someplace...</i>

484
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:56,622
<i>...and spend the rest of my life in peace.</i>
