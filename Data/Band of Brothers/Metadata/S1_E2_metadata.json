    "Easy Company paratroopers jump behind enemy lines in Normandy on D-Day and struggle to reunite in hostile territory.",
    "In the very early hours of the D-Day invasion, Easy Company along with thousands of other Allied paratroopers land behind enemy lines in Normandy. In the chaos of the jump however, they are spread far and wide with many landing far from their expected drop zone. Lt. Winters assembles the few men they can find and slowly make their way to their rendezvous point. As the men straggle in, they also must adjust such as when Malarkey meets a German soldier who grew up in Oregon. Easy's Company commander is still missing so Winters is left in charge and is ordered to take out a German artillery bunker that is wreaking havoc with the troops landing on the beach. They do so with great efficiency and are rewarded with several Bronze and Silver Stars and the Distinguished Service Cross for Winters.\u2014garykmcd",
    "On the D-Day, the allied paratroopers jump behind the German lines and the Easy Company is scattered in Normandy and many of the survivors have lost their weapons. Sgt. Richard D.
