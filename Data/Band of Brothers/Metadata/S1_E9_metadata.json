With more time to reflect, some of the men are wondering if it was all worth it and begin to question whether the sacrifices they and their absent colleagues have made were worth it. That question is answered when they come across a concentration camp and they see first hand the atrocities committed by the Nazis. Captain Nixon has returned from a jump behind enemy lines that did not go well and resulted in many deaths. He's drinking heavily and has been demoted from Regimental to Battalion intelligence officer. Soon after Hiltler's death, they are ordered to Bertchesgarden, the Nazi leader's mountain-top retreat.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1247470", "rating": 9.5, "votes": 12335, "number_of_episodes": 10}
