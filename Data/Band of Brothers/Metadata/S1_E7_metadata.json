However, morale is low due to cold weather, constant shelling, poor leadership, and numerous casualties.", "Easy Company is still in the Ardennes forest but the Germans are in retreat. The men are cold and living in foxholes knowing that they will likely be ordered to try and take the town. The Germans have been pushed back to the town of Foy but they are well positioned and have heavy artillery. Their artillery barrages take a heavy toll and several of the veterans of Easy Company are severely wounded including Bill Guarnere and Joe Toye. Those injuries have a particularly heavy impact on their good friend, Lt. Buck Compton. When the attack does come, Easy Company is led by the ineffectual Lt. Dike who makes several tactical errors leading to unnecessary casualties. Capt. Winters, who is observing the battle would like nothing better than to rush into battle to lead his old Company but cannot. In the end, he orders Lt. Speirs to take command of the attack.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1247468", "rating": 9.4, "votes": 11057, "number_of_episodes": 10}
