This major engagement is to thrust north into Holland seizing the bridges along the way with a view to giving the Allies a clear route into Germany. The men of Easy Company are told that they will be leaving for good and they parachute into near Eindhoven, where they get a huge welcome from the war-weary population. With significant losses in Normandy invasion, Easy also has to welcome new recruits who, in the eyes of the now veteran combat soldiers who have survived, as much a liability as a benefit. The battle is not easy with the Germans putting up fierce resistance. The situation is particularly dire for Sgt. Bull Randelman who is separated from the rest of the Company and is forced to hide out in a local barn overnight as the Germans move in. The battle was not a success and did not shorten the war as had been hoped.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1247467", "rating": 8.8, "votes": 10251, "number_of_episodes": 10}
