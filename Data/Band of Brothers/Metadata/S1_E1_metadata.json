    "Easy Company goes through training under the leadership of a captain who relentlessly pushes them to their limits but may be limited as a leader in the field.",
    "In 1942, men from across the USA are in Camp Toccoa, Georgia to undergo paratrooper training. For the men of 'E' Easy Company the training is particularly difficult as a result of their demanding commander, Captain Herbert Sobel. He drives them incessantly to excel, canceling their weekend passes on a whim. His favorite chore is to have the men undertake a run up a hill known as Currahee. While the men are fit and ready for battle, thanks to Sobel, he has unfortunately shown himself to be a weak tactical commander. Once in England, and knowing they will soon be invading the Continent, the sergeants stage a rebellion. Sobel's excesses come to an end when Lt. Dick Winters requests a court martial rather than accept punishment for one of Sobel's lame charges.\u2014garykmcd",
    "On June 4, 1944 - just two days before the Allied invasion of Normandy - Lieutenants Richard Winters and Lewis Nixon reflect back on the events and training that led them to D-Day with the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment - also known as Easy Company."
