The patrol includes one veteran who is despised for missing Bastogne and a new lieutenant fresh out of West Point.", "It's February 1945 and a depleted Easy Company is now in Haguenau, France, on the Rhine just across from Germany. Pvt. David Webster, who was injured during Operation Market Garden, returns to the Company but finds that his absence from the fighting in Bastogne has alienated the others and he is treated as an outsider. The Company also has a new junior officer, Lt. Henry Jones, a West Point graduate who has yet to get any battlefield experience. The war is clearly coming to an end and the men are starting to think they might just survive. When Colonel Sink orders a raid across the river to take prisoners for interrogation, the men are less than keen to take part but follow orders. No one believes it's worth it when one of the men dies from the wounds he receives. When Colonel Sink orders another raid the next night, Captain Winters has his own unique way of dealing with the situation.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1247469", "rating": 8.7, "votes": 9292, "number_of_episodes": 10}
