Meanwhile, exhausted medic Eugene Roe finds friendship with a Belgian nurse.", "It's a cold, harsh Christmas 1944 for the men of Easy Company as they try to hold the line around Bastogne against attacking German forces. They have no winter clothing, limited rations and little ammunition. For Eugene Roe, one of the medics, the problem is getting basic medical supplies. He's been scrounging what he can, but it simply isn't enough. He's managed to get supplies from a Belgian nurse in Bastogne, Ren\u00e9e, but as the casualties mount, he finds himself lacking even the most basic supplies. The men of Easy Company are left on their own much of the time as the Company commander, Lt. Dike, spends most of his in his foxhole.\u2014garykmcd"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1247462", "rating": 9.2, "votes": 11476, "number_of_episodes": 10}
