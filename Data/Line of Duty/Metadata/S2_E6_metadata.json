However the order was to spare Lindsay. Hastings charges Dryden for the driving scam but has insufficient evidence for the weightier charges as Dryden apparently proves that the last he saw of Carly was when he put her on a train. Kate is surprised that Steve seems to believe in Lindsay's innocence until he admits that he is purposely trying to gain her confidence to trap her. When she is shown to have accepted a proposal by a colleague to snare a child abuser she seems less innocent than she claims but is she really guilty of conspiracy to murder?\u2014don @ minifie-1"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "3162282", "rating": 8.2, "votes": 1391, "number_of_episodes": 37}
