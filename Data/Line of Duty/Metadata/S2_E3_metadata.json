Growing increasingly desperate, she tells Kate about a relationship with an executive police officer and her theory of why she is being framed.", "Lindsay is remanded in custody where she is victimized by both staff and prisoners. Meanwhile Steve and Kate discover the identity of the dead witness from blunt inspector Cottan. He was known as Tommy and Cottan believes that Jayne Akers, his liaison officer, was the real mole who betrayed the escort. Kate visits Lindsay, who knows about her affair with Jayne's husband whilst Cottan has similar suspicions. Lindsay's accusations also cause friction between Hastings and Steve, whilst Dryden's driving offence attracts the press so to save himself he strikes a deal naming Lindsay as the officer under investigation. Kate discovers a body, apparently that of the missing Carly, and returns to see Lindsay, who claims her ex-lover Dryden set her up. Kate makes a call which seems to support this whilst Cottan gets evidence to prove Jayne was on the take.\u2014don @ minifie-1"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "3162274", "rating": 8.2, "votes": 1359, "number_of_episodes": 37}
