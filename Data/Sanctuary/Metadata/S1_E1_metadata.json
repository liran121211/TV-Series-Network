When he is called to the scene of a shooting where two policemen died, he immediately knows something is wrong. The family of four who lived in the apartment claim the cops were killed by a gunman but Will is certain there is a fifth person who lives there, probably a teenager. The policeman in charge of the case isn't too interested in what Will has to say since they already have a suspect in mind.
