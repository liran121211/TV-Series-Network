And he is right. Not only do they block the toilet and alter his Facebook picture but set about destroying more flowers in a neighbour's garden. Next morning the boys find themselves under siege from the angry gardener but there's no hiding place as Will's mother returns home early.\u2014don @ minifie-1", "Mr. Gilbert threatens to ruin Will's college applications unless he rat on whoever vandalized the village's flower bed display. Although Will truly did not know who did it when Mr. Gilbert asked him, he soon finds out it was Jay and Neil. Meanwhile, much to Will's chagrin, his mom has gone away for the weekend to meet up with a male college chum named Fergus, with who she had recently got reacquainted on Facebook. Beyond now being able to wank off over her on the Internet and wanking off over the thought of her having sex with Fergus, Will's mates want him to have a party at his house while she's away. Will refuses his mates' request. But not wanting to be alone for the weekend, Will invites Neil to stay for the weekend. Simon can't make it due to a father/son golf tournament, and Jay is Will's last choice since he would probably try to get in Polly's underwear drawer, especially in his increased sexually frustrated state over not being able to masturbate at home in front of his dog, Benji. It does balloon into a \"party\" (but not in Will's mind) when Jay infiltrates the house and Simon stops by between rounds, the three who end up being less than perfect house guests. But as all four consume a lot of beer, they end up having a close encounter with some more flower beds, and Jay comes up with a more permanent solution to the Benji problem. In the sober light of day, neither action seems like such a good idea.\u2014Huggo"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "1728928", "rating": 8.2, "votes": 1115, "number_of_episodes": 18}
