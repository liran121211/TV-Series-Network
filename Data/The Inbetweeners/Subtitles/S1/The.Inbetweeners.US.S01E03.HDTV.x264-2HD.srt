1
00:00:00,025 --> 00:00:02,633
Even with Simon's new chick magnet, ***...

2
00:00:02,753 --> 00:00:03,734
This is your car?

3
00:00:03,854 --> 00:00:06,190
...he was still having no luck with Carly.

4
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:08,506
- Sex ***.
- Jesus, Simon.

5
00:00:08,626 --> 00:00:11,923
And for all of us, it seemed like our
popularity was quickly dropping.

6
00:00:12,239 --> 00:00:14,087
- Hi, Wendy.
- Bye, nobody.

7
00:00:16,365 --> 00:00:18,568
We were stuck in the middle
of the social scale.

8
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,656
*** was even more frighting than that,

9
00:00:20,776 --> 00:00:23,947
was that Jay thought a bowling alley
was the place to raise our status.

10
00:00:24,829 --> 00:00:27,844
If they don't have a sticker machine
in there, I'm gonna lose my mind.

11
00:00:27,964 --> 00:00:30,537
Dude, we're here to get wasted in here,
not buy stickers.

12
00:00:30,657 --> 00:00:32,401
- You really think they'll serve us?
- Absolutely.

13
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:34,972
Drinking in a bowling alley
is complete ***.

14
00:00:35,092 --> 00:00:36,229
They don't even ID.

15
00:00:36,349 --> 00:00:38,988
People are here to bowl, dude, not drink.

16
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,220
Yeah, they look pretty sober.

17
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,967
But why are we here on a Thursday?

18
00:00:47,087 --> 00:00:50,865
Because drinking on a school night is the
quickest way to raise your social status,

19
00:00:50,985 --> 00:00:52,903
without being more handsome,
or more smarter.

20
00:00:53,023 --> 00:00:55,593
- Don't think he said that, ***.
- More handsomer, whatever, dude.

21
00:00:55,713 --> 00:00:57,191
We're here to drink, not learn.

22
00:00:57,311 --> 00:00:58,457
Let's go.

23
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:22,038
Grab a table. I'll get the first round.

24
00:01:23,857 --> 00:01:25,471
Four whiskeys please.

25
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:29,146
- Got ID?
- What?

26
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:31,123
ID?

27
00:01:31,614 --> 00:01:34,272
Um, I must have left it in...

28
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:36,582
my other...

29
00:01:37,835 --> 00:01:39,660
This place sucks.

30
00:01:39,662 --> 00:01:41,262
They ran out of beer.

31
00:01:41,264 --> 00:01:42,997
Another one of your plans
just went down in flames.

32
00:01:42,999 --> 00:01:45,516
Maybe we should just bowl.

33
00:01:45,518 --> 00:01:48,136
I'm not sticking my fingers
in a communal ball.

34
00:01:48,138 --> 00:01:48,936
Hey, give me the money.

35
00:01:48,938 --> 00:01:50,471
I can handle this.

36
00:01:58,854 --> 00:02:01,866
Hey, can I buy you a beer?

37
00:02:01,868 --> 00:02:03,785
Sure.

38
00:02:03,787 --> 00:02:04,535
Great.

39
00:02:04,537 --> 00:02:07,622
Uh, you can just buy one for you and
then four for me and my friends.

40
00:02:07,624 --> 00:02:08,856
Uh, here's the money.

41
00:02:08,858 --> 00:02:11,359
Bartender.

42
00:02:11,361 --> 00:02:12,493
Five beers please.

43
00:02:12,495 --> 00:02:15,380
I better not see anybody
else drinking these.

44
00:02:15,382 --> 00:02:17,398
They'll never leave my sight.

45
00:02:22,778 --> 00:02:24,639
Problem solved.

46
00:02:24,641 --> 00:02:26,174
Oh, dude!

47
00:02:26,176 --> 00:02:28,092
Hey, guys.

48
00:02:28,094 --> 00:02:30,895
Thanks for the invite.

49
00:02:30,897 --> 00:02:31,763
Cool muscles!

50
00:02:31,765 --> 00:02:32,897
Thanks, man.

51
00:02:32,899 --> 00:02:33,981
Thanks.

52
00:02:33,983 --> 00:02:35,767
He bought us the beer, so he
has to stay here, but we don't

53
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:36,984
have to talk to him.

54
00:02:36,986 --> 00:02:38,519
You know he can hear us, right?

55
00:02:38,521 --> 00:02:39,220
Who can hear us?

56
00:02:39,222 --> 00:02:40,855
Best not to draw
attention to it.

57
00:02:40,857 --> 00:02:41,989
Cheers!

58
00:02:41,991 --> 00:02:42,657
Cheers.

59
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:43,391
Yeah.

60
00:02:43,993 --> 00:02:45,443
Screw it; I'm goin' home.

61
00:02:45,445 --> 00:02:47,445
I can still catch Carla while
she's babysitting my brother.

62
00:02:47,447 --> 00:02:50,031
Maybe I can see her for ten minutes
without Bobby's hand on her ass.

63
00:02:50,033 --> 00:02:51,399
Or maybe she brought
Bobby there.

64
00:02:51,401 --> 00:02:53,067
He could be nailing her right
now in your race car bed.

65
00:02:53,787 --> 00:02:54,469
Shut up.

66
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:55,953
Oh, she just found
the stick shift.

67
00:02:55,955 --> 00:02:57,121
"Ooh, bobbybobbybobbybobby!"

68
00:02:57,123 --> 00:02:59,207
Stop it; I don't want
that image in my head.

69
00:02:59,209 --> 00:02:59,924
Yeah, me neither.

70
00:02:59,926 --> 00:03:01,426
Carly's pretty high
on my yank list.

71
00:03:01,428 --> 00:03:02,093
What?

72
00:03:02,095 --> 00:03:02,760
Are you serious?

73
00:03:02,762 --> 00:03:03,594
It's no big deal.

74
00:03:03,596 --> 00:03:05,213
We don't romanticize
her like you do.

75
00:03:05,215 --> 00:03:05,930
You do it too?

76
00:03:05,932 --> 00:03:07,382
She's in the rotation.

77
00:03:07,384 --> 00:03:09,217
Wow, what does this
girl look like?

78
00:03:09,219 --> 00:03:10,251
Oh, I'll text you a picture.

79
00:03:10,253 --> 00:03:12,186
Don't text him a picture.

80
00:03:12,188 --> 00:03:12,854
Relax, Si.

81
00:03:12,856 --> 00:03:14,806
Pumping the python is
very healthy thing.

82
00:03:14,808 --> 00:03:16,357
You don't want to
catch blue balls.

83
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:17,975
Eh, you could always lift a car.

84
00:03:17,977 --> 00:03:19,394
'Scuse me?

85
00:03:19,396 --> 00:03:20,611
Get rid of blue balls.

86
00:03:20,613 --> 00:03:21,629
You just lift a car.

87
00:03:21,631 --> 00:03:23,731
Drains the blood right
out of your pee pot.

88
00:03:24,701 --> 00:03:26,901
Hey, here's to pee pots.

89
00:03:26,903 --> 00:03:27,652
Yup.

90
00:03:29,072 --> 00:03:30,371
Well, this was fun.

91
00:03:30,373 --> 00:03:31,239
Yeah.

92
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:33,708
Oh, man, you guys are leaving?

93
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:34,959
God.

94
00:03:34,961 --> 00:03:36,110
What about you so far?

95
00:03:36,112 --> 00:03:37,245
You want to hang out a bit?

96
00:03:37,247 --> 00:03:37,912
Maybe.

97
00:03:37,914 --> 00:03:39,613
Do you have money for
the sticker machine?

98
00:03:39,615 --> 00:03:41,416
It has tattoos.

99
00:03:41,418 --> 00:03:42,383
So do I.

100
00:03:42,385 --> 00:03:43,835
Neil!

101
00:03:43,837 --> 00:03:45,002
Let's go.

102
00:03:45,004 --> 00:03:45,670
He has tattoos.

103
00:03:45,672 --> 00:03:48,122
I know he does, buddy.

104
00:03:48,124 --> 00:03:52,059
So after buying Neil a sticker and
leaving the bartender a justifiably poor

105
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:57,698
tip, we ended our night out just as we
began it: Totally sober and uncool.

106
00:03:58,802 --> 00:04:02,170
Oh, God.

107
00:04:02,172 --> 00:04:04,172
Is there a back exit maybe?

108
00:04:04,174 --> 00:04:11,479
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

109
00:04:11,481 --> 00:04:14,699
The only thing more depressing than our
failure at the bowling alley was the

110
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:19,420
realization that we might never be any
cooler than this, and we all felt it.

111
00:04:19,422 --> 00:04:22,523
But for some, the only way
to accept defeat was denial.

112
00:04:22,525 --> 00:04:24,375
Had to sleep in this morning.

113
00:04:24,377 --> 00:04:25,676
Massive hangover.

114
00:04:25,678 --> 00:04:27,094
You had a doctor's
appointment, didn't you?

115
00:04:27,096 --> 00:04:29,664
No. Nope.

116
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,265
I was drunk.

117
00:04:31,935 --> 00:04:32,767
My head is pounding.

118
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:34,202
You know we were
with you, right?

119
00:04:34,204 --> 00:04:35,603
Went back to the bar late night.

120
00:04:35,605 --> 00:04:37,355
Got racked off of teabag-tinis.

121
00:04:37,357 --> 00:04:39,607
What?

122
00:04:39,609 --> 00:04:41,809
It's when you dip your balls
into a Martini, and then all the

123
00:04:41,811 --> 00:04:43,511
sluts want a taste.

124
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,696
And how does that get you drunk?

125
00:04:45,698 --> 00:04:47,615
Then you drink the Martini.

126
00:04:47,617 --> 00:04:48,783
The one your balls were in?

127
00:04:48,785 --> 00:04:50,284
No.

128
00:04:50,286 --> 00:04:51,685
A different one obviously.

129
00:04:51,687 --> 00:04:52,687
Obviously.

130
00:04:52,689 --> 00:04:53,821
Oh, I got a ginger ale.

131
00:04:53,823 --> 00:04:55,423
Can we all dip our
balls in this?

132
00:04:55,425 --> 00:04:57,124
We're not dipping our
balls into anything.

133
00:04:57,126 --> 00:04:59,727
Can't take this anymore, all
this lying about being cool.

134
00:04:59,729 --> 00:05:01,045
I thought that was our thing.

135
00:05:01,047 --> 00:05:02,530
What a great calling card, Neil.

136
00:05:02,532 --> 00:05:04,465
"We pretend we're not
gigantic losers."

137
00:05:04,467 --> 00:05:06,050
Let's not pretend for a change.

138
00:05:06,052 --> 00:05:07,335
Be gigantic losers?

139
00:05:07,337 --> 00:05:09,036
No, let's actually do something.

140
00:05:09,038 --> 00:05:10,704
So yes to the ginger ale?

141
00:05:10,706 --> 00:05:11,923
Hey, Carly!

142
00:05:11,925 --> 00:05:13,674
I noticed Bobby didn't
drop you off this morning?

143
00:05:13,676 --> 00:05:15,042
I didn't know you were watching.

144
00:05:15,044 --> 00:05:16,477
I wasn't. I didn't watch.

145
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,347
He had to go out of town for
his grandmother's funeral.

146
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:21,732
Wow. Life.

147
00:05:21,734 --> 00:05:23,601
So fragile.

148
00:05:23,603 --> 00:05:24,385
What are you doing tonight?

149
00:05:24,387 --> 00:05:26,571
Uh, thinkin' about doing a
girls' night clubbing downtown.

150
00:05:26,573 --> 00:05:27,522
Us too.

151
00:05:27,524 --> 00:05:28,489
Right.

152
00:05:27,549 --> 00:05:30,226
Right, right, we were also gonna go downtown.

153
00:05:30,228 --> 00:05:30,926
Uh-huh.

154
00:05:30,928 --> 00:05:31,627
Yeah.

155
00:05:31,629 --> 00:05:32,761
Really?

156
00:05:32,763 --> 00:05:34,396
I didn't know clubbing
was your scene.

157
00:05:34,398 --> 00:05:36,148
Well, then you don't
know us at all, carly.

158
00:05:36,817 --> 00:05:39,101
That's what I keep
telling people.

159
00:05:39,103 --> 00:05:40,853
What club are you guys going to?

160
00:05:41,772 --> 00:05:42,738
We're going to spectrum.

161
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,073
Spectrum--that's the one.

162
00:05:44,075 --> 00:05:44,857
Oh, we love spectrum.

163
00:05:44,859 --> 00:05:46,008
We were there this morning.

164
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:46,992
You've never been there.

165
00:05:46,994 --> 00:05:49,078
No, we haven't, but we've
been meaning to go.

166
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:49,862
Do we need I.D.S?

167
00:05:49,864 --> 00:05:52,198
Felicia knows the bouncer, so just
make sure to get in line with us.

168
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:53,165
Perfect.

169
00:05:53,167 --> 00:05:54,833
Well, we'll see you
there tonight.

170
00:05:54,835 --> 00:05:56,368
You'll be coming too?

171
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:57,386
Totally.

172
00:05:57,388 --> 00:05:58,287
Cool.

173
00:05:58,289 --> 00:06:01,090
See you then.

174
00:06:01,092 --> 00:06:01,874
Yes!

175
00:06:01,876 --> 00:06:04,376
You have to beat the cooter off with a
stick at these downtown nightclubs.

176
00:06:04,378 --> 00:06:07,329
And with Bobby gone, I can finally
get some alone time with carly.

177
00:06:07,331 --> 00:06:08,797
That Sloan girl asked
me if I was going.

178
00:06:08,799 --> 00:06:09,598
You guys saw that, right?

179
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,100
Yeah, she touched her hair.

180
00:06:11,102 --> 00:06:12,551
Total body language cue.

181
00:06:12,553 --> 00:06:13,886
She can sense our new momentum.

182
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:14,687
Or she has lice.

183
00:06:14,686 --> 00:06:16,938
Either way, I have
a shot at her.

184
00:06:17,058 --> 00:06:18,340
Mine, mine, mine, mine, mine.

185
00:06:18,342 --> 00:06:19,692
You can keep the salad.

186
00:06:19,694 --> 00:06:20,859
Things were turning around.

187
00:06:20,861 --> 00:06:22,177
We were going clubbing.

188
00:06:22,179 --> 00:06:24,179
We were going to be cool.

189
00:06:33,405 --> 00:06:35,362
You look like you got hit
by an ice cream truck.

190
00:06:35,485 --> 00:06:36,450
Whatever.

191
00:06:36,452 --> 00:06:37,568
Club girls love this stuff.

192
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,945
I'm def gonna minivan
a girl tonight.

193
00:06:39,115 --> 00:06:39,997
Minivan her?

194
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:41,532
Yeah, two in the front,
five in the back.

195
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:42,366
Gross.

196
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:43,817
Well, at least you're
not wearing sneakers.

197
00:06:43,819 --> 00:06:44,702
These are fresh!

198
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:45,819
You couldn't wear shoes?

199
00:06:45,821 --> 00:06:46,754
Jay wore shoes. I wore shoes.

200
00:06:46,756 --> 00:06:47,788
Those are flippers.

201
00:06:47,790 --> 00:06:48,673
These are hip.

202
00:06:48,675 --> 00:06:49,340
They're Italian.

203
00:06:49,342 --> 00:06:51,709
Uh, scusi, where my fleepers?

204
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:52,426
Shut up.

205
00:06:52,428 --> 00:06:53,878
Maybe the club'll
have a scuba tank.

206
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:56,130
They're not flippers.

207
00:06:56,132 --> 00:06:57,498
Why do we have to pick up Neil?

208
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,016
He couldn't meet us
at Simon's house?

209
00:06:59,018 --> 00:07:02,353
'Cause Neil's sister's
home from college.

210
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,804
Hi, Tina.

211
00:07:03,806 --> 00:07:06,440
Neil, you friends are here.

212
00:07:06,442 --> 00:07:09,343
So, Tina, what kind of clubs
do you go--like to go?

213
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:10,010
What?

214
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:12,279
Can you please stop
staring at my tits?

215
00:07:12,281 --> 00:07:12,980
Huh?

216
00:07:12,982 --> 00:07:13,681
What?

217
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:14,448
Heh.

218
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:15,816
You just looked.

219
00:07:15,818 --> 00:07:17,851
Looking.

220
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:21,389
L-- looking.

221
00:07:21,391 --> 00:07:24,325
What?

222
00:07:24,327 --> 00:07:25,493
Hey, guys!

223
00:07:25,495 --> 00:07:26,711
Check out will's flippers.

224
00:07:26,713 --> 00:07:27,545
Uh.

225
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:28,362
They're stylish.

226
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,531
They look like Dorothy's house
is about to fall on you.

227
00:07:30,533 --> 00:07:31,632
Can we go?

228
00:07:31,634 --> 00:07:32,533
Sure.

229
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,634
Shouldn't you walk backwards?

230
00:07:33,636 --> 00:07:34,719
They're not flippers!

231
00:07:34,721 --> 00:07:37,838
Shotgun.

232
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,232
Nobody answer that.

233
00:07:48,234 --> 00:07:48,983
Will's mom.

234
00:07:48,985 --> 00:07:49,650
You sure?

235
00:07:49,652 --> 00:07:51,352
Wouldn't rather have
sex with your sister?

236
00:07:51,354 --> 00:07:53,687
Yeah, that's an
easy choice for me.

237
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:54,905
That game sucks.

238
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:57,992
I'd take will's mom, but I bet
Neil's sister gives better b.J.S.

239
00:07:57,994 --> 00:07:59,527
If her dad taught her anything.

240
00:07:59,529 --> 00:08:00,795
My dad is not gay.

241
00:08:00,797 --> 00:08:02,530
He's less gay than will's shoes.

242
00:08:02,532 --> 00:08:03,614
At least I'm wearing shoes.

243
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:05,616
You look a coach of a
woman's volleyball team.

244
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,284
Simon, would you pull over?

245
00:08:07,286 --> 00:08:08,335
I got to pee.

246
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:09,954
There's nowhere to stop here.

247
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,123
Hold on, si. Slow down.

248
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,924
Bus turds!

249
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,129
Dude, where'd that come from?

250
00:08:18,131 --> 00:08:18,796
I don't know.

251
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:19,764
It just felt right.

252
00:08:19,766 --> 00:08:21,577
You could see their little faces
drop as they thought,

253
00:08:21,697 --> 00:08:23,384
"we must be the bus turds."

254
00:08:24,753 --> 00:08:25,419
Come on, guys.

255
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,520
I've really got to pee.

256
00:08:26,522 --> 00:08:27,354
Just hold it, Neil.

257
00:08:27,356 --> 00:08:31,442
We're late.

258
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:33,093
What are you doing?

259
00:08:33,095 --> 00:08:33,944
Oh, God, Neil!

260
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:35,229
Are you peeing?

261
00:08:35,231 --> 00:08:35,863
It's okay.

262
00:08:35,865 --> 00:08:36,614
I've got the tip pressed in.

263
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:37,398
It's not gonna spill.

264
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,065
I don't care.

265
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:41,318
Don't pee in my-- ow, I'm cut!

266
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,437
You cut my helmet!

267
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:45,372
I think it's bleeding.

268
00:08:45,374 --> 00:08:46,240
Screw bleeding.

269
00:08:46,242 --> 00:08:46,940
Is it still peeing?

270
00:08:46,942 --> 00:08:47,774
It stings!

271
00:08:47,776 --> 00:08:51,778
Oh, God, just get
rid of it, Neil!

272
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:54,048
Jesus, come on!

273
00:08:54,050 --> 00:08:56,884
We had made it downtown with
3 1/2 penises intact, but we

274
00:08:56,886 --> 00:08:58,552
weren't about to give up.

275
00:08:58,554 --> 00:09:00,304
Carly was waiting for Simon.

276
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:02,623
A girl who touched her
hair was waiting for me.

277
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,757
We had to find this club.

278
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:05,893
Oh, my crank is really bleeding.

279
00:09:05,895 --> 00:09:07,628
Oh, my eyeliner's
starting to run.

280
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,929
We're totally lost.

281
00:09:08,931 --> 00:09:11,298
If we don't get in line with the
girls, the bouncer won't let us in.

282
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:11,982
Find it already.

283
00:09:11,984 --> 00:09:12,966
I'm trying!

284
00:09:12,968 --> 00:09:13,901
Si, wait, hold on.

285
00:09:13,903 --> 00:09:14,985
No, Jay, don't!

286
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,637
Bus turds!

287
00:09:18,491 --> 00:09:19,273
Why are you slowing down?

288
00:09:19,275 --> 00:09:23,911
I tried to tell you.

289
00:09:23,913 --> 00:09:24,578
Oh, God!

290
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:25,279
Drive!

291
00:09:25,281 --> 00:09:25,996
Where do you want me to go?

292
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,916
Anywhere!

293
00:09:28,918 --> 00:09:30,534
Drive!

294
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:32,786
Anywhere!

295
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:35,155
Anywhere but here.

296
00:09:36,825 --> 00:09:37,992
Wow.

297
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:42,129
You're like the transporter.

298
00:09:42,131 --> 00:09:43,547
Oh, God, Simon.

299
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:44,465
Oh, God.

300
00:09:44,467 --> 00:09:45,165
Oh, God.

301
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,717
Oh.

302
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:48,185
Hey, who's a bus turd, huh?

303
00:09:48,187 --> 00:09:49,002
Me?

304
00:09:49,004 --> 00:09:51,555
Sorry, sorry, sorr--
I'm a turd, huh?

305
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:52,940
Yeah.

306
00:09:52,942 --> 00:09:53,607
That's real funny, man.

307
00:09:53,609 --> 00:09:54,942
Why ain't you laughing any more?

308
00:09:54,944 --> 00:09:56,143
Sorry. Really sorry!

309
00:09:56,145 --> 00:09:57,394
He just said he was sorry.

310
00:09:58,564 --> 00:09:59,980
Sorry.

311
00:09:59,982 --> 00:10:02,182
You know, I'd rather be a bus
turd than ride around in that

312
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,485
yellow piece of.

313
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:17,581
Wow, you are such a pansy.

314
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:19,433
What?

315
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:22,002
"Oh, sorry--oh, I'm so sorry."

316
00:10:22,004 --> 00:10:24,922
"I'm so sorry I'm on the
sidewalk--I'm sorry."

317
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,040
"Sorry, you hands found
my neck--ooh, sorry."

318
00:10:27,042 --> 00:10:28,509
Screw you guys.

319
00:10:28,511 --> 00:10:30,359
"Oh, I'm sorry that I was mean."

320
00:10:31,043 --> 00:10:33,385
- Did you see his muscles?
- "Oh, I'm sorry."

321
00:10:34,036 --> 00:10:36,767
So after circling the block ten
times looking for a parking

322
00:10:36,887 --> 00:10:41,102
spot, we finally made it to the
club, 1/2 an hour late but eager to

323
00:10:41,222 --> 00:10:42,684
get our night back on track.

324
00:10:42,766 --> 00:10:44,182
Is it legal to park here?

325
00:10:44,184 --> 00:10:45,183
We're so late.

326
00:10:45,185 --> 00:10:46,151
Come on.

327
00:10:46,153 --> 00:10:47,719
It says loading zone.

328
00:10:47,721 --> 00:10:49,287
I think that's for weekdays.

329
00:10:49,289 --> 00:10:52,524
Plus, we're gonna be
loading it with.

330
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:53,391
We can't get towed.

331
00:10:53,393 --> 00:10:55,276
I told my dad we were at
Neil's house playing <i>risk.</i>

332
00:10:55,278 --> 00:10:56,361
<i>That was an option?</i>

333
00:10:56,363 --> 00:10:59,030
<i>You won't get towed, and we don't
have time to find another spot.</i>

334
00:10:59,032 --> 00:11:01,966
<i>Come on.</i>

335
00:11:01,968 --> 00:11:04,135
<i>Excuse me, sir.</i>

336
00:11:04,137 --> 00:11:06,538
<i>Is it legal to park here?</i>

337
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,872
<i>I'll watch it for you.</i>

338
00:11:07,874 --> 00:11:08,540
<i>Perfect.</i>

339
00:11:08,542 --> 00:11:09,374
<i>He'll keep an eye out.</i>

340
00:11:09,376 --> 00:11:10,291
<i>Gimme your sneakers.</i>

341
00:11:10,293 --> 00:11:10,959
<i>What?</i>

342
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:11,960
<i>Your shoes.</i>

343
00:11:11,962 --> 00:11:14,045
<i>I watch the car, we trade shoes.</i>

344
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:15,413
<i>We have to get into
that club, Simon.</i>

345
00:11:15,415 --> 00:11:16,414
<i>This could change everything.</i>

346
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:17,382
<i>Come on, si.</i>

347
00:11:17,384 --> 00:11:19,851
<i>Carly isn't gonna
minivan herself.</i>

348
00:11:19,853 --> 00:11:20,518
<i>Yeah.</i>

349
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:23,254
<i>Yeah, come on, si.</i>

350
00:11:23,256 --> 00:11:24,422
<i>Oh, God.</i>

351
00:11:26,426 --> 00:11:27,091
<i>These are wet.</i>

352
00:11:27,093 --> 00:11:27,758
<i>Why are they wet?</i>

353
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,028
<i>Maybe it has something to do with
the fact they reek of urine.</i>

354
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:31,112
<i>I'm walking in bum piss?</i>

355
00:11:31,114 --> 00:11:32,263
<i>How's the arch support?</i>

356
00:11:32,265 --> 00:11:33,431
<i>Soaked in bum piss.</i>

357
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:34,899
<i>Simon, hey!</i>

358
00:11:34,901 --> 00:11:35,733
<i>Hi, carly.</i>

359
00:11:35,735 --> 00:11:37,935
<i>Hey, the line starts back here!</i>

360
00:11:37,937 --> 00:11:39,320
<i>You made it just in time.</i>

361
00:11:39,322 --> 00:11:40,155
<i>Hey, Sloan.</i>

362
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,272
<i>Excited to get your dance on?</i>

363
00:11:41,274 --> 00:11:42,740
<i>Sure. You?</i>

364
00:11:42,742 --> 00:11:43,458
<i>Oh, of course.</i>

365
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,276
<i>Anything in 4/4 and a
reasonable tempo, right?</i>

366
00:11:45,278 --> 00:11:46,828
<i>What do you think you're doing?</i>

367
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,630
<i>Think those people are
throwing trash at you.</i>

368
00:11:48,632 --> 00:11:49,297
<i>Back of the line!</i>

369
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:50,915
<i>Well, you know, they're
probably just eager to dance</i>

370
00:11:50,917 --> 00:11:51,833
<i>like you and I are.</i>

371
00:11:51,835 --> 00:11:53,501
<i>Hey, do you mind if stand
with my back to you?</i>

372
00:11:53,503 --> 00:11:55,086
<i>I don't want anyone to
think that I know you.</i>

373
00:11:55,088 --> 00:11:56,387
<i>Of course, that's fine.</i>

374
00:11:56,389 --> 00:11:58,173
<i>I actually think eye contact
with can be really distracting</i>

375
00:11:58,175 --> 00:11:58,840
<i>on a date.</i>

376
00:11:58,842 --> 00:12:01,643
<i>Eh... Sloan had a very
nice back of the head.</i>

377
00:12:01,645 --> 00:12:05,230
<i>After enjoying that for a few
minutes, the unthinkable happened.</i>

378
00:12:05,232 --> 00:12:07,131
<i>We were let into a club.</i>

379
00:12:12,489 --> 00:12:14,138
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

380
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,306
<i>It does exist.</i>

381
00:12:15,308 --> 00:12:16,974
<i>Holy moly.</i>

382
00:12:16,976 --> 00:12:17,742
<i>This is it.</i>

383
00:12:17,744 --> 00:12:20,811
<i>First day of the
rest of our lives.</i>

384
00:12:20,813 --> 00:12:27,252
<i>This is one small step for man
and one giant leap for your dumb</i>

385
00:12:27,254 --> 00:12:28,536
<i>flippers, will.</i>

386
00:12:28,538 --> 00:12:30,655
<i>Well, you won't be laughing
when we leave here with carly</i>

387
00:12:30,657 --> 00:12:31,673
<i>and Sloan.</i>

388
00:12:31,675 --> 00:12:32,757
<i>Come on, Simon.</i>

389
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:33,841
<i>Ladies await.</i>

390
00:12:33,843 --> 00:12:35,426
<i>Good luck with
your little girls.</i>

391
00:12:35,428 --> 00:12:37,378
<i>Neil and I are gonna
find some real women.</i>

392
00:12:38,381 --> 00:12:40,515
<i>Ah, check out the
boobies on that one.</i>

393
00:12:40,517 --> 00:12:41,499
<i>Oh, man, th's t good.</i>

394
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:43,017
<i>Aw, what are you
talking about, man?</i>

395
00:12:43,019 --> 00:12:44,552
<i>Those things are doin'
a dance on their own.</i>

396
00:12:44,554 --> 00:12:47,672
<i>Oh, no, but I'm getting a chub,
and the cut--oh, it hurts.</i>

397
00:12:47,674 --> 00:12:49,140
<i>I got to go check it out.</i>

398
00:12:49,142 --> 00:12:50,007
<i>Whatever, man.</i>

399
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:50,841
<i>More for me.</i>

400
00:12:52,845 --> 00:12:55,813
<i>You can do this.</i>

401
00:13:26,701 --> 00:13:27,999
Simon, I was looking for you.

402
00:13:28,379 --> 00:13:30,088
- You found me.
- We're gonna hit the dance floor.

403
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:32,287
Oh, okay.

404
00:13:32,407 --> 00:13:34,901
- Have fun then.
- No, you wanna come?

405
00:13:35,021 --> 00:13:37,355
<i>Yeah, I--let's dance.</i>

406
00:13:37,357 --> 00:13:40,074
<i>Come on!</i>

407
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:49,450
<i>So have you guys seen Sloan?</i>

408
00:13:49,452 --> 00:13:51,786
<i>I want to make sure I can grab
her on when the slow dance comes on.</i>

409
00:13:51,788 --> 00:13:53,338
<i>Don't think there
are slow dances.</i>

410
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:54,455
<i>I think she's over there.</i>

411
00:13:54,457 --> 00:13:56,457
<i>Yeah?</i>

412
00:14:08,254 --> 00:14:09,988
<i>You're such a lightweight.</i>

413
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,222
<i>I can't even believe that.</i>

414
00:14:11,224 --> 00:14:11,990
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

415
00:14:11,992 --> 00:14:13,808
<i>Because you're, like, 12 pounds.</i>

416
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:14,592
<i>Stop.</i>

417
00:14:14,594 --> 00:14:16,594
<i>You are.</i>

418
00:14:16,596 --> 00:14:20,615
<i>Hey, man.</i>

419
00:14:20,617 --> 00:14:22,033
<i>What happened to
your new girlfriend?</i>

420
00:14:22,035 --> 00:14:23,484
<i>She's not my
girlfriend-- well, yet.</i>

421
00:14:23,486 --> 00:14:25,069
<i>'Cause she's talkin'
to some guy.</i>

422
00:14:25,071 --> 00:14:25,770
<i>That's awesome, man.</i>

423
00:14:25,772 --> 00:14:26,771
<i>She's testing you out.</i>

424
00:14:26,773 --> 00:14:28,406
<i>Making sure you're
really an alpha dog.</i>

425
00:14:28,408 --> 00:14:29,490
<i>Alpha dog?</i>

426
00:14:29,492 --> 00:14:31,826
<i>Yeah, now you have
to prove it, okay?</i>

427
00:14:31,828 --> 00:14:34,612
<i>You got to top dog him, raw dog
her, and then finish it off</i>

428
00:14:34,614 --> 00:14:35,946
<i>doggystyle.</i>

429
00:14:35,948 --> 00:14:38,082
<i>You know I'm not a dog, right?</i>

430
00:14:38,084 --> 00:14:41,586
<i>Look, will, all these girls, they
follow club code, and I get it.</i>

431
00:14:41,588 --> 00:14:43,254
<i>Why do you think I'm
dressed like this?</i>

432
00:14:43,256 --> 00:14:44,789
<i>I look like a moron.</i>

433
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:46,474
<i>You got to play the game, will.</i>

434
00:14:46,476 --> 00:14:49,761
<i>- It's like chess...
- With your.</i>

435
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:52,680
<i>I don't know if it was the chess
analogy or the hypnotizing</i>

436
00:14:52,682 --> 00:14:58,469
<i>effect of his mascara,
but Jay made sense.</i>

437
00:14:58,471 --> 00:15:00,855
<i>You're so funny.</i>

438
00:15:00,857 --> 00:15:04,575
<i>Tag. You're it.</i>

439
00:15:04,577 --> 00:15:07,779
<i>Ready for that dance?</i>

440
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:09,347
<i>Hi, I'm will.</i>

441
00:15:09,349 --> 00:15:12,817
<i>I'm Dean.</i>

442
00:15:12,819 --> 00:15:14,202
<i>So you come here often?</i>

443
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,787
<i>Do you say that
to all the girls?</i>

444
00:15:16,673 --> 00:15:18,256
<i>Stubborn one, this guy is.</i>

445
00:15:18,258 --> 00:15:21,209
<i>Listen, Sloan has obviously
been talking to you to make me</i>

446
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:24,379
<i>jealous, which I'll admit did
work for awhile until I figured</i>

447
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,680
<i>it all out.</i>

448
00:15:25,682 --> 00:15:29,517
<i>Now you can just leave, and we're
gonna dance the night away.</i>

449
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,835
<i>What?</i>

450
00:15:30,837 --> 00:15:31,569
<i>No, we're not.</i>

451
00:15:31,571 --> 00:15:34,439
<i>But we came here together.</i>

452
00:15:34,441 --> 00:15:35,556
<i>No, we didn't.</i>

453
00:15:35,558 --> 00:15:37,007
<i>But I stood next to you in line.</i>

454
00:15:37,009 --> 00:15:38,076
<i>Behind me.</i>

455
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:41,028
<i>Adjacent, and I specifically
remember you asking me to come here.</i>

456
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:41,846
<i>I have witnesses.</i>

457
00:15:41,848 --> 00:15:44,382
<i>Will, I think you
misinterpreted things.</i>

458
00:15:44,384 --> 00:15:45,566
<i>Well, apparently.</i>

459
00:15:45,568 --> 00:15:47,051
<i>What, should I just leave
you two alone then?</i>

460
00:15:47,053 --> 00:15:49,320
<i>Yes, please just go away.</i>

461
00:15:49,322 --> 00:15:50,037
<i>Okay.</i>

462
00:15:50,039 --> 00:15:50,905
<i>Well, maybe I will.</i>

463
00:15:50,907 --> 00:15:53,374
<i>Thanks, Dean.</i>

464
00:15:53,376 --> 00:15:55,359
<i>Enjoy.</i>

465
00:15:55,361 --> 00:15:57,361
<i>Must be nice!</i>

466
00:15:57,363 --> 00:15:59,263
<i>Oh.</i>

467
00:15:59,265 --> 00:16:01,499
<i>Ow.</i>

468
00:16:02,869 --> 00:16:05,670
<i>Come on, man.</i>

469
00:16:05,672 --> 00:16:07,338
<i>Jesus.</i>

470
00:16:07,340 --> 00:16:09,039
<i>It's not what it looks like.</i>

471
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:19,267
<i>Meanwhile, Jay's game of dress
like a moron chess finally</i>

472
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,385
<i>paid off.</i>

473
00:16:21,387 --> 00:16:40,087
<i>But capturing the queen proved
to be quite painful for his</i>

474
00:16:40,089 --> 00:16:40,788
<i>bishop.</i>

475
00:16:43,793 --> 00:16:49,847
<i>Dude, huge problem.</i>

476
00:16:49,849 --> 00:16:51,716
<i>I've been grinding for
20 minutes straight.</i>

477
00:16:51,718 --> 00:16:52,550
<i>So?</i>

478
00:16:52,552 --> 00:16:53,968
<i>I've got blue balls.</i>

479
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:56,888
<i>I got to Jack the beanstalk so I
can get back there on my game.</i>

480
00:16:56,890 --> 00:16:59,724
<i>You want to try over a urinal?</i>

481
00:16:59,726 --> 00:17:00,725
<i>No.</i>

482
00:17:00,727 --> 00:17:02,092
<i>Maybe.</i>

483
00:17:02,094 --> 00:17:03,093
<i>The far one clears up.</i>

484
00:17:03,095 --> 00:17:04,529
<i>Wait, what did that
guy in the bar say?</i>

485
00:17:04,531 --> 00:17:06,063
<i>You just need to lift a car.</i>

486
00:17:06,065 --> 00:17:07,698
<i>There are no cars
in the club, Neil!</i>

487
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,200
<i>Maybe it doesn't
need to be a car.</i>

488
00:17:09,202 --> 00:17:11,619
<i>Just something really
heavy to flex your balls.</i>

489
00:17:12,956 --> 00:17:15,706
<i>Ow.</i>

490
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,708
<i>Stand back.</i>

491
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:21,278
<i>Do you smell urine?</i>

492
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,296
<i>Huh?</i>

493
00:17:22,298 --> 00:17:23,047
<i>No.</i>

494
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:24,832
<i>I think it's coming
from your shoes.</i>

495
00:17:24,834 --> 00:17:26,116
<i>What?</i>

496
00:17:26,118 --> 00:17:28,152
<i>That's crazy.</i>

497
00:17:28,154 --> 00:17:30,454
<i>I'm ready to go.</i>

498
00:17:30,456 --> 00:17:31,956
<i>Hey, it's will!</i>

499
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:32,623
<i>Wait!</i>

500
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:33,724
<i>He smells like pee!</i>

501
00:17:33,726 --> 00:17:36,126
<i>What?</i>

502
00:17:37,063 --> 00:17:38,312
<i>It's working!</i>

503
00:17:38,314 --> 00:17:41,065
<i>The blood is leaving
my balls, Neil!</i>

504
00:17:43,019 --> 00:17:43,968
<i>That's the perv.</i>

505
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,903
<i>He was totally playin'
with himself.</i>

506
00:17:49,993 --> 00:17:55,530
<i>Stop it!</i>

507
00:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,314
<i>I'll put it back on!</i>

508
00:17:57,316 --> 00:17:59,534
<i>I'm gonna fix it!</i>

509
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,535
<i>Why would I smell like urine?</i>

510
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,036
<i>You're the one
wearing bum shoes.</i>

511
00:18:02,038 --> 00:18:03,170
<i>Oh, lord.</i>

512
00:18:03,172 --> 00:18:06,457
<i>Simon, are you wearing a
homeless person's shoes?</i>

513
00:18:06,459 --> 00:18:11,012
<i>I--I, uh...</i>

514
00:18:11,014 --> 00:18:11,762
<i>I was--ow!</i>

515
00:18:11,764 --> 00:18:14,432
<i>I was just rolling it around
because the tip is cut.</i>

516
00:18:14,434 --> 00:18:15,383
<i>Blue balls!</i>

517
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:17,602
<i>You don't understand!</i>
<i>I had blue balls!</i>

518
00:18:23,943 --> 00:18:25,943
<i>I'm wearing the bum's shoes</i>

519
00:18:39,144 --> 00:18:42,735
<i>And just like that, our night of
elevating our status had ended.</i>

520
00:18:42,737 --> 00:18:44,938
<i>Did you really just get
thrown out of a club?</i>

521
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:49,025
<i>Nah, it's probably more
of a cooling off period.</i>

522
00:18:50,245 --> 00:18:51,744
<i>Nah.</i>
<i>Let's leave.</i>

523
00:18:51,746 --> 00:18:53,496
<i>Teach these dicks a lesson.</i>

524
00:18:53,498 --> 00:18:56,616
<i>But it took us a moment to realize
we had accomplished something.</i>

525
00:18:56,618 --> 00:18:58,818
<i>We just got thrown
out of a club.</i>

526
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,220
<i>We did.</i>

527
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:01,821
<i>I just got thrown out of a club.</i>

528
00:19:01,823 --> 00:19:03,122
<i>I was thrown out before you.</i>

529
00:19:03,124 --> 00:19:04,174
<i>I exposed myself.</i>

530
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:05,625
<i>What?</i>

531
00:19:05,627 --> 00:19:06,543
<i>I sliced my Peter--look.</i>

532
00:19:06,545 --> 00:19:07,210
<i>No!</i>

533
00:19:07,212 --> 00:19:08,428
<i>No, no!</i>

534
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:09,212
<i>What?</i>

535
00:19:09,214 --> 00:19:10,997
<i>I'm not gonna
you with it.</i>

536
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:14,467
<i>But, like all of our moments of
triumph, it was short-lived.</i>

537

<i>What the hell?</i>

538
00:19:19,774 --> 00:19:20,974
<i>It didn't get towed.</i>

539
00:19:20,976 --> 00:19:23,059
<i>You guys said this
spot was legal!</i>

540
00:19:23,061 --> 00:19:23,893
<i>I don't know.</i>

<i>Hey, you!</i>

543
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,896
<i>What happened to my car?</i>

chances with carly!</i>

548

<i>You got a picture?</i>

550
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:36,539
<i>I'll text you a picture.</i>

551
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:37,490
<i>Don't text him one.</i>

552
00:19:37,492 --> 00:19:38,708
<i>Gimme back my shoes.</i>

553
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:39,459

<i>Is that?</i>

00:19:43,164 --> 00:19:45,048
<i>How did you even
manage to do that?</i>

557
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,332
<i>I got friends too.</i>

558
00:19:46,334 --> 00:19:47,884
<i>Now give me back my shoes.</i>

559
00:19:47,886 --> 00:19:48,868
<i>Oh, God!</i>

<i>Just give him back his shoes.</i>

565
00:19:58,730 --> 00:19:59,979
<i>I'm not opening this window.</i>

<i>Smells like piss in here.</i>

567
00:20:01,683 --> 00:20:03,233
<i>Neil, put it back in your pants.</i>

<i>Oh, my God!</i>

570
00:20:05,687 --> 00:20:08,187
<i>But we would press on, seeking
shelter when we needed</i>
