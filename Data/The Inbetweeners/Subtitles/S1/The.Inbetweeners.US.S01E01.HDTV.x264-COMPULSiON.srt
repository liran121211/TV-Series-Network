1
00:00:00,774 --> 00:00:06,215
My name is Will Mackenzie, and
these are my closest friends.

2
00:00:06,217 --> 00:00:08,101
So you're sticking
with the briefcase.

3
00:00:08,103 --> 00:00:09,469
It's a messenger bag.

4
00:00:09,471 --> 00:00:10,687
It's definitely a briefcase.

5
00:00:10,689 --> 00:00:12,338
Or a purse.

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,307
Well, my last school
discouraged backpacks.

7
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:16,059
They don't want us to look
like a bunch of ninja turtles.

8
00:00:16,061 --> 00:00:18,061
They wanted you to
look like dickheads?

9
00:00:18,063 --> 00:00:23,483
I've known them since yesterday,
which is also when I met

10
00:00:23,485 --> 00:00:26,685
the school's vice principal.

11
00:00:26,687 --> 00:00:28,905
Simon.

12
00:00:28,907 --> 00:00:30,189
Come here.

13
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:32,691
This right here is
William Mackenzie.

14
00:00:32,693 --> 00:00:36,412
He is just transferred here, and you
have been selected to show him around.

15
00:00:36,414 --> 00:00:37,080
What?

16
00:00:37,082 --> 00:00:37,880
Why me?

17
00:00:37,882 --> 00:00:39,365
Because you were standing
closest to the door.

18
00:00:39,367 --> 00:00:40,032
What is that?

19
00:00:40,034 --> 00:00:40,699
A briefcase?

20
00:00:40,701 --> 00:00:41,467
It's a messenger bag.

21
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:43,920
Oh, is it delivering the
message "My mom dressed me"?

22
00:00:46,257 --> 00:00:49,559
He's like a miniature
grown-up, but full-sized.

23
00:00:50,595 --> 00:00:51,260
Stop it.

24
00:00:51,262 --> 00:00:53,062
Why do I have to
show him around?

25
00:00:53,064 --> 00:00:55,581
Because William suffered from
bulling issues at his last school.

26
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:56,232
What?

27
00:00:57,352 --> 00:00:58,551
No, I didn't.

28
00:00:58,553 --> 00:01:00,052
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

29
00:01:00,054 --> 00:01:04,323
Sorry, but it is, and I wasn't, so...
It was your face, I bet.

30
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:09,112
You know, you do have one of those faces
that just makes people wanna... boom.

31
00:01:09,114 --> 00:01:09,779
What?

32
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:11,197
Nothing.

33
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:13,499
Welcome to grove high.

34
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:15,435
Get to class!

35
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:24,594
It wasn't my idea to transfer here...

36
00:01:24,596 --> 00:01:26,779
But it also wasn't my idea
for my dad to run off

37
00:01:26,781 --> 00:01:30,316
with his secretary and leave my mom with
no way to pay my private school fees.

38
00:01:30,318 --> 00:01:33,519
But this place is real and
try to put a fee on that.

39
00:01:33,521 --> 00:01:35,521
Oh, I think these are
my sister's pants.

40
00:01:35,523 --> 00:01:38,090
Yeah, I wasn't gonna say anything, but
you have a rhinestone butterfly on

41
00:01:38,092 --> 00:01:38,757
the back.

42
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,145
Oh, son of a bitch.

43
00:01:42,147 --> 00:01:43,095
All right, there's carly.

44
00:01:43,097 --> 00:01:44,063
Give it.

45
00:01:44,065 --> 00:01:45,148
Give me the ball.

46
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,366
You really think throwing a
football will make a girl like you?

47
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:48,367
Yeah.

48
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:49,986
It makes her see
him as an athlete.

49
00:01:49,988 --> 00:01:51,537
It's subliminal advertising.

50
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:53,573
It's the opposite of
subliminal, actually.

51
00:01:53,575 --> 00:01:54,240
It's true.

52
00:01:54,242 --> 00:01:54,907
It's liminal.

53
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:56,209
Not a word.

54
00:01:56,211 --> 00:01:59,045
You know we don't
like you, right?

55
00:01:59,047 --> 00:02:04,950
And as I came from a school
where popularity was determined

56
00:02:04,952 --> 00:02:10,890
by how early you got into Harvard...
You see that throw?

57
00:02:10,892 --> 00:02:17,296
It was nice to be somewhere you could
have it by throwing a football.

58
00:02:17,298 --> 00:02:19,932
Oh!

59
00:02:23,505 --> 00:02:25,805
Yep, this was going to be great.

60
00:02:25,807 --> 00:02:29,890

61
00:02:31,172 --> 00:02:34,212
So far, my time in public school
has been a wonderful

62
00:02:34,332 --> 00:02:36,664
voyage of discovery...

63
00:02:40,305 --> 00:02:42,169
Hi.

64
00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:49,862
About how different public schools
work, especially the toilets,

65
00:02:49,864 --> 00:02:52,732
which have no doors on them
to discourage drug use.

66
00:02:52,734 --> 00:02:57,937
This also, curiously enough,
discourages [bleep].

67
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:01,557
But at least I got to spend some
more time with my new friends.

68
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,945
I'm telling you guys, I spent the
entire summer trapping beaver.

69
00:03:05,947 --> 00:03:08,614
Okay, that's the thing about RV
girls, is that they all have

70
00:03:08,616 --> 00:03:09,899
the same thing in common.

71
00:03:09,901 --> 00:03:10,616
They're poor?

72
00:03:10,618 --> 00:03:15,655
No, these girls are sluts, dude, and
they'll do it to you for hours.

73
00:03:15,657 --> 00:03:17,039
I'm so good at sex now.

74
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:17,740
Really?

75
00:03:17,742 --> 00:03:19,325
So what is the best
way to do it, then?

76
00:03:19,327 --> 00:03:20,126
Deep.

77
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:21,861
Just like real
deep to the balls.

78
00:03:21,863 --> 00:03:23,162
Do you put the balls in?

79
00:03:23,164 --> 00:03:24,497
What?

80
00:03:24,499 --> 00:03:27,366
I heard you gotta put your balls in
if you really want to get a girl off.

81
00:03:27,368 --> 00:03:28,701
Yeah, you can.

82
00:03:28,703 --> 00:03:29,368
It's preference.

83
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,036
Some girls like it.

84
00:03:30,038 --> 00:03:31,270
Some girls don't.

85
00:03:31,272 --> 00:03:34,140
Personally, I like to
go in past the balls.

86
00:03:34,142 --> 00:03:35,258
That doesn't even make sense.

87
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:35,942
Yes, it does.

88
00:03:35,944 --> 00:03:37,727
No, because you've never had
sex with anyone, and neither

89
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:39,712
have I, and neither has Neil.

90
00:03:39,714 --> 00:03:43,716
Okay, well, you guys can think what
you want, but I--I have busted enough

91
00:03:43,718 --> 00:03:45,768
condoms to tell you
that--

92
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,271
Oh, [bleep].

93
00:03:50,057 --> 00:03:50,856
Oh, sorry.

94
00:03:50,858 --> 00:03:51,524
Oh, sorry.

95
00:03:51,526 --> 00:03:54,360
Go huskies.

96
00:03:54,362 --> 00:03:59,749
And as much as I wished I didn't fit
in with these idiots...

97
00:03:59,751 --> 00:04:03,469
I did.

What?

105
00:04:28,929 --> 00:04:31,647
Good manners cost nothing.

106
00:04:31,649 --> 00:04:33,532
My dad brang me new pants.

107
00:04:33,534 --> 00:04:34,483
Oh, yeah?

108
00:04:34,485 --> 00:04:36,402
Did you "brang" him his back?

109
00:04:36,404 --> 00:04:38,204
Those were my sister's.

110
00:04:38,206 --> 00:04:40,206
Yeah, your dad's more
of a cutoffs guy.

111
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,607
What is that supposed to mean?

112
00:04:41,609 --> 00:04:44,910
It means there isn't room in his closest
for anything besides cutoffs and him.

113
00:04:44,912 --> 00:04:46,329
My dad is not gay.

114
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:47,780
Does an awful lot of gardening.

115
00:04:47,782 --> 00:04:49,131
Yeah, but he lifts
up weights too.

116
00:04:49,133 --> 00:04:51,000
You should see him
with his shirt off.

117
00:04:51,002 --> 00:04:53,786
Yeah, he's always telling
us the same thing.

118
00:04:53,788 --> 00:04:55,338
My dad is not gay!

119
00:04:57,342 --> 00:04:58,507
I can sit anywhere, right?

120
00:04:58,509 --> 00:04:59,759
Tables aren't assigned?

121
00:04:59,761 --> 00:05:02,127
You're lucky we let you sit
with us, dress 4 less.

122
00:05:02,129 --> 00:05:04,180
That blazer makes all
of us look uncool.

123
00:05:04,182 --> 00:05:06,565
We're barely above
the wall eaters now.

124
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:07,466
Oh, no.

125
00:05:07,468 --> 00:05:09,685
Those guys aren't gonna have
sex until they're dead.

126
00:05:09,687 --> 00:05:11,970
But we will be banging bitches
by the end of the week.

127
00:05:11,972 --> 00:05:14,657
It's time we turn the panty
tide in our direction.

128
00:05:14,659 --> 00:05:16,141
We're skipping school tomorrow.

129
00:05:16,143 --> 00:05:17,142
What?

130
00:05:17,144 --> 00:05:20,479
Girls love rebels, and it's time
to show them who we really are.

131
00:05:20,481 --> 00:05:21,747
By not showing them who you are.

132
00:05:21,749 --> 00:05:23,366
Does seem a little backwards.

133
00:05:23,368 --> 00:05:24,867
Well, that's how the
female mind works.

134
00:05:24,869 --> 00:05:25,785
But, whatever, do what you want.

135
00:05:25,787 --> 00:05:27,536
I mean, I'm already up
to my nuts in guts.

136
00:05:27,538 --> 00:05:30,656
I was just trying to help you guys bang
something other than your right hands.

137
00:05:30,658 --> 00:05:31,490
Oh, it's left for me.

138
00:05:31,492 --> 00:05:33,509
It feels more like someone
else is doing it.

139
00:05:33,511 --> 00:05:35,828
Just do what your dad does
and have someone else do it.

140
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,929
My dad is not gay.

141
00:05:36,931 --> 00:05:38,347
You know, it'd be
fine if he was.

142
00:05:38,349 --> 00:05:40,299
I actually have a gay uncle who's
actually single right now.

143
00:05:40,301 --> 00:05:41,884
Oh, why does he have to garden?

144
00:05:41,886 --> 00:05:43,135
I'm trying to help.

145
00:05:43,137 --> 00:05:45,354
Well, if skipping school
helps me with Carly, I'm in.

146
00:05:45,356 --> 00:05:47,306
I mean, I've had a crush on
her since we were eight.

147
00:05:47,308 --> 00:05:49,392
You had a crush on
an eight-year-old?

148
00:05:49,394 --> 00:05:51,110
Our families are friends, Neil.

149
00:05:51,112 --> 00:05:52,178
We were both eight.

150
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:56,032
Yeah, but still, you were
attracted to an eight-year-old.

151
00:05:56,034 --> 00:05:58,617
Well, she's not eight anymore,
and she's looking good.

152
00:05:58,619 --> 00:05:59,351
Who's looking good?

153
00:05:59,353 --> 00:06:00,018
Ah, nobody.

154
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:00,903
Our football team.

155
00:06:00,905 --> 00:06:02,822
We're gonna be great this year.

156
00:06:02,824 --> 00:06:03,572
Go huskies!

157
00:06:03,574 --> 00:06:04,457
Shut the [bleep] up.

158
00:06:04,459 --> 00:06:07,243
Yeah, piss off.

159
00:06:07,245 --> 00:06:08,711
So I didn't see much
of you this summer.

160
00:06:08,713 --> 00:06:10,746
I guess you stopped going to
church with your parents, huh?

161
00:06:10,748 --> 00:06:11,464
Yeah.

162
00:06:11,466 --> 00:06:14,300
I spent most of my Sundays
just jamming on my strat.

163
00:06:14,302 --> 00:06:15,885
Music's my church now.

164
00:06:15,887 --> 00:06:19,255
Yeah, your mom told me you got
a job at the cracker barrel.

165
00:06:19,257 --> 00:06:20,205
Did she?

166
00:06:20,207 --> 00:06:21,874
But that wasn't our agreement.

167
00:06:21,876 --> 00:06:23,092
No, it's cool.

168
00:06:23,094 --> 00:06:25,928
Are you wearing aftershave?

169
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:31,016
Kind of an all-over body spray.

170
00:06:31,018 --> 00:06:32,017
I like it.

171
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:33,736
It's like a leathery musk.

172
00:06:33,738 --> 00:06:35,654
That part's just me.

173
00:06:35,656 --> 00:06:37,073
I'm headed to the
science building.

174
00:06:37,075 --> 00:06:37,740
Are you?

175
00:06:37,742 --> 00:06:39,608
No, I-- go ahead.

176
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:40,576
Just do it.

177
00:06:40,578 --> 00:06:42,194
Okay, bye.

178
00:06:42,196 --> 00:06:43,162
Bye, Wendy.

179
00:06:43,164 --> 00:06:44,296
Bye, nobody.

180
00:06:44,298 --> 00:06:46,499
Dude, are you mental?

181
00:06:46,501 --> 00:06:49,168
Why didn't you
walk her to class?

182
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,202
I'm good.

183
00:06:50,204 --> 00:06:51,287
Oh.

184
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:53,923
Did the pretty little
lady give Simon a boner?

185
00:06:53,925 --> 00:06:55,040
No.

186
00:06:55,042 --> 00:06:56,926
Oh, man, I think she did.

187
00:06:56,928 --> 00:06:58,711
Seriously?

188
00:07:00,014 --> 00:07:02,431
Simon's got a boner!

189
00:07:03,684 --> 00:07:05,684
Simon's got a boner!

190
00:07:09,209 --> 00:07:11,594
Just kidding, man.

191
00:07:13,629 --> 00:07:16,595
If I was going to survive this school,
I knew I couldn't do it alone.

192
00:07:16,715 --> 00:07:19,833
So looks like I don't have any
grade-determining assignments

193
00:07:19,835 --> 00:07:21,312
tomorrow, if you guys are
serious about skipping.

194
00:07:21,432 --> 00:07:22,740
Who said you were invited?

195
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:25,224
Oh, man, we have to be invited?

196
00:07:25,435 --> 00:07:26,985
Oh, my God.

197
00:07:26,987 --> 00:07:28,937
And given enough time...

198
00:07:28,939 --> 00:07:31,105
People will always find
something they like about you.

199
00:07:31,107 --> 00:07:34,442
Holy [bleep].

200
00:07:34,444 --> 00:07:37,445
Even if it's not you.

201
00:07:37,447 --> 00:07:38,747
Dude, is that your mom?

202
00:07:38,749 --> 00:07:39,447
Yes.

203
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:40,832
I told her not to
come and pick me up.

204
00:07:40,834 --> 00:07:41,583
She is hot.

205
00:07:41,585 --> 00:07:43,318
Yeah, I'd renob her in a second.

206
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:44,803
I'm not gonna ask
what that means.

207
00:07:44,805 --> 00:07:46,254
"Renob" is "boner" backwards.

208
00:07:46,256 --> 00:07:48,923
I'd literally renob her so hard
that my penis would be pushed

209
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:50,008
back into my body.

210
00:07:50,761 --> 00:07:51,810
Thanks.

211
00:07:51,812 --> 00:07:54,229
She's so hot she could
be a prostitute.

212
00:07:54,231 --> 00:07:55,764
Nobody be afraid to say
what you're thinking.

213
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:57,349
When was the last time
that you saw her naked?

214
00:07:57,351 --> 00:08:01,653
I'm walking away now.

215
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:07,208
Um, Simon's gonna email you his address,
so we'll meet there in the morning.

216
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,194
Maybe mom can drop you off.

217
00:08:09,196 --> 00:08:14,449
So you made some
friends already?

218
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:16,284
I wasn't very selective.

219
00:08:16,286 --> 00:08:18,319
Oh, well, just make sure
they're nice to you, okay?

220
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:20,455
I don't want to see you
get bullied again.

221
00:08:20,457 --> 00:08:22,791
Did you tell them I was bullied at St.
Mary's?

222
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:23,658
I thought you were.

223
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:26,928
No, I got wedgied a few times,
but that was just a fad.

224
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,097
Oh.

225
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:31,800
The next morning, I headed to
Simon's house to skip school

226
00:08:31,802 --> 00:08:32,801
for the first time ever.

227
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:33,551
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

228
00:08:33,553 --> 00:08:35,336
So who was this new boy that's
dropping you to school?

229
00:08:35,338 --> 00:08:37,055
Oh, there he is.

230
00:08:37,057 --> 00:08:38,723
Good morning, all.

231
00:08:38,725 --> 00:08:42,177
You're old enough to drive?

232
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:43,745
Yes.

233
00:08:43,747 --> 00:08:46,948
Yeah--yes, I am that
old enough to drive.

234
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,199
I drive everywhere.

235
00:08:48,201 --> 00:08:49,284
I drove here, even.

236
00:08:49,286 --> 00:08:50,719
I parked right over there.

237
00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:52,287
The panel van.

238
00:08:52,289 --> 00:08:55,073
Yes.

239
00:08:55,075 --> 00:09:00,378
It is a little molestery, but I got
it at a great deal from a molester,

240
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,863
but he never molested in it.

241
00:09:01,865 --> 00:09:04,332
You know, just
transported to molest.

242
00:09:04,334 --> 00:09:05,333
Stop saying "molest."

243
00:09:05,335 --> 00:09:06,334
I can't.

244
00:09:06,336 --> 00:09:08,720
Bye, mom.

245
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:10,422
That was flawless.

246
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:11,589
Guys.

247
00:09:11,591 --> 00:09:13,591
Molester.

248
00:09:13,593 --> 00:09:14,976
I should have pointed
to the Volvo.

249
00:09:14,978 --> 00:09:16,511
Dude, you think?

250
00:09:16,513 --> 00:09:18,012
Hey.

251
00:09:18,014 --> 00:09:19,063
You guys need a lift?

252
00:09:19,065 --> 00:09:19,731
Sure.

253
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:21,065
Neil?

254
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:22,317
Oh, maybe later, I guess.

255
00:09:22,319 --> 00:09:23,601
You got cool muscles.

256
00:09:23,603 --> 00:09:24,986
Neil!

257
00:09:24,988 --> 00:09:27,122
All right.

258
00:09:27,124 --> 00:09:30,608
So so far, skipping school
had consisted of lying

259
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:33,728
to Simon's mom, dodging a rape,
and hanging out with the only

260
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,247
other people not in
school or at work:

261
00:09:36,249 --> 00:09:37,165
Two-year-olds.

262
00:09:37,167 --> 00:09:39,167
What?

263
00:09:39,169 --> 00:09:42,337
All right, this is totally lame.

264
00:09:42,339 --> 00:09:44,956
Yo, we should get a game of red
rover going with them or something.

265
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,758
No, Neil, we should
get some booze.

266
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,842
How?

267
00:09:47,844 --> 00:09:50,295
Well, we could have used my
fake I.D., but I totally lost

268
00:09:50,297 --> 00:09:52,130
it in this drug rave last night.

269
00:09:52,132 --> 00:09:53,298
It's so stupid.

270
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:56,083
Yeah, you'd think you'd be more
careful in your made-up fantasies.

271
00:09:56,085 --> 00:09:57,635
Actually they're not
made up, dickhead.

272
00:09:57,637 --> 00:10:00,855
'Cause if you tested my piss right
now, it'd be, like, 80% coke.

273
00:10:00,857 --> 00:10:04,025
You know, it's the middle
of the school day.

274
00:10:04,027 --> 00:10:06,561
Liquor stores are
expecting adults.

275
00:10:06,563 --> 00:10:09,364
I mean, somebody just
has to look the part.

276
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:18,873
Good afternoon.

277
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,175
Hey.

278
00:10:20,177 --> 00:10:20,875
Yes.

279
00:10:20,877 --> 00:10:22,544
Hey.

280
00:10:22,546 --> 00:10:27,782
Uh, I am a man who has recently
bought a house in the area,

281
00:10:27,784 --> 00:10:31,452
and I'm gonna be throwing a housewarming
party, which I'll be inviting a lot

282
00:10:31,454 --> 00:10:35,390
of my work friends to-- other adults,
you know, hence the potato chips.

283
00:10:35,392 --> 00:10:39,694
And I am probably gonna need some
alcohol to go with the potato chips.

284
00:10:39,696 --> 00:10:41,095
What type of thing
are you looking for?

285
00:10:41,097 --> 00:10:44,766
Uh, can I have a
bottle of, uh, Babnik?

286
00:10:44,768 --> 00:10:45,433
Vodka.

287
00:10:45,435 --> 00:10:46,100
Yes.

288
00:10:46,102 --> 00:10:46,768
Is it a good year?

289
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:47,435
What?

290
00:10:47,437 --> 00:10:48,102
I'm sure it is.

291
00:10:48,104 --> 00:10:49,470
Can I have two bottles
of that, please?

292
00:10:49,472 --> 00:10:50,137
Right.

293
00:10:50,139 --> 00:10:50,939
That'll be $49.50.

294
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:51,906
Anything else?

295
00:10:51,908 --> 00:10:53,274
Hmm, what's on special?

296
00:10:53,276 --> 00:10:55,543
Me letting you buy this if you're
outta here in five seconds.

297
00:10:55,545 --> 00:10:57,028
I think this'll do it.

298
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:03,501
♪ Doom-doom-doom-doom ♪ doom-da-doom
♪ doom-doom-doom ♪ 3, 6, 9

299
00:11:03,503 --> 00:11:07,288
♪ very, very fine ♪ hoping she can
sock it to me ♪ one more time drink.

300
00:11:07,290 --> 00:11:10,875
♪ Low ♪ get low, get low
♪ get low oh, my God.

301
00:11:10,877 --> 00:11:12,010
I can't feel my throat.

302
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:14,662
Maybe we're supposed to
mix it with something.

303
00:11:14,664 --> 00:11:15,496
Are you serious, man?

304
00:11:15,498 --> 00:11:16,764
This is awesome.

305
00:11:16,766 --> 00:11:18,266
You still have half
of yours left.

306
00:11:18,268 --> 00:11:19,350
I know, man.

307
00:11:19,352 --> 00:11:21,352
I'm making it last.

308
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,139
I wish Carly could see me now.

309
00:11:25,141 --> 00:11:27,175
I should text her
a picture, huh?

310
00:11:27,177 --> 00:11:29,060
Show her how much
of a badass I am.

311
00:11:29,062 --> 00:11:31,479
I don't think badasses text
pictures of themselves, though.

312
00:11:31,481 --> 00:11:32,447
Only of their [bleep].

313
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:33,248
I do it all the time.

314
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:35,650
It's like a bat
signal for snizz.

315
00:11:35,652 --> 00:11:37,385
Chicks always text
back a beaver shot.

316
00:11:37,387 --> 00:11:38,152
Really?

317
00:11:38,154 --> 00:11:39,037
Let's see one, then.

318
00:11:39,039 --> 00:11:43,241
You wouldn't be able to tell what it was,
because they take it from the inside.

319
00:11:45,078 --> 00:11:49,363
You know, guys, if this skipping thing
helps us with chicks, I don't want to

320
00:11:49,365 --> 00:11:51,933
have sex with just anybody.

321
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,419
I want to lose it
with someone I love.

322
00:11:54,421 --> 00:11:55,270
I love Carly.

323
00:11:56,139 --> 00:11:56,804
I do.

324
00:11:56,806 --> 00:11:58,089
I love her.

325
00:11:58,091 --> 00:11:59,641
I mean, she's beautiful.

326
00:11:59,643 --> 00:12:00,341
She's smart.

327
00:12:00,343 --> 00:12:01,926
She makes me laugh.

328
00:12:01,928 --> 00:12:02,894
Why don't you tell her that?

329
00:12:02,896 --> 00:12:04,378
Girls like being
told guys like them.

330
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,681
Just be direct and spray
paint it on an overpass.

331
00:12:06,683 --> 00:12:07,432
No, no, no, no.

332
00:12:07,434 --> 00:12:09,150
That's not romantic enough.

333
00:12:09,152 --> 00:12:11,402
You want to get the girl?

334
00:12:11,404 --> 00:12:16,157
Gotta aim straight
for the heart.

335
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:19,127
Like milk.

336
00:12:19,129 --> 00:12:21,029
Catch.

337
00:12:30,006 --> 00:12:31,122
This is cool, right?

338
00:12:31,124 --> 00:12:32,206
Oh, yeah, man.

339
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,207
Super cool.

340
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:34,292
It's so cool.

341
00:12:34,294 --> 00:12:36,644
I think writing her last name
is especially important,

342
00:12:36,646 --> 00:12:37,512
even though it's her driveway.

343
00:12:37,514 --> 00:12:38,346
What the hell is that?

344
00:12:38,348 --> 00:12:40,131
What?

345
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:40,798
Simon?

346
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,433
Why are you spray-painting
my driveway?

347
00:12:42,435 --> 00:12:45,419
Um... what is it-- you love me?

348
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,691
I can easily wash this off,
and we can pretend this never

349
00:12:49,693 --> 00:12:51,893
happened, and you could not
tell anyone, and I could not

350
00:12:51,895 --> 00:12:54,262
tell anyone, and your friends
could not tell anyone.

351
00:12:54,264 --> 00:12:56,197
Oh, I'm telling everyone.

352
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:59,901
Simon, we've known each
other since we were eight.

353
00:12:59,903 --> 00:13:01,819
Why are you doing this now?

354
00:13:01,821 --> 00:13:03,404
I--it was a dare.

355
00:13:03,406 --> 00:13:04,872
So what then?

356
00:13:04,874 --> 00:13:06,541
You're in love with me?

357
00:13:06,543 --> 00:13:09,794
Maybe we could just talk
about this another time.

358
00:13:09,796 --> 00:13:11,295
This couldn't have
gone any better.

359
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:15,633
She doesn't love you, man.

360
00:13:15,635 --> 00:13:17,301
You wasted all that paint.

361
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:21,956
Actually I think this is cool.

362
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:25,176
It's like some underground
graffiti artist thing.

363
00:13:25,178 --> 00:13:26,644
Wait, huh?

364
00:13:26,646 --> 00:13:27,395
Yeah, you know what?

365
00:13:27,397 --> 00:13:28,262
Why don't you come over later?

366
00:13:28,264 --> 00:13:29,814
I'm babysitting my brother.

367
00:13:29,816 --> 00:13:30,598
We can talk about it then.

368
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,232
Really?

369
00:13:31,234 --> 00:13:32,767
Come after 8:00, 'cause
my parents will be gone

370
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:36,487
by then, and you should probably
avoid them until this washes off.

371
00:13:36,489 --> 00:13:38,039
Not sure it washes off.

372
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,942
See you tonight.

373
00:13:40,944 --> 00:13:43,828
I-- I can't believe that worked.

374
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:44,862
I second that.

375
00:13:44,864 --> 00:13:46,414
Dude, it's because
you're so drunk.

376
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,281
You're like Kurt Cobain.

377
00:13:47,283 --> 00:13:49,050
I think he was on heroin.

378
00:13:49,052 --> 00:13:50,018
Do I have to do heroin?

379
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,952
Probably won't hurt.

380
00:13:50,954 --> 00:13:53,454
Well, it's really hard to
find, and I don't want to dip

381
00:13:53,456 --> 00:13:57,091
into my personal stash, so... okay,
so what do I do about tonight?

382
00:13:57,093 --> 00:13:59,961
Easy.

383
00:13:59,963 --> 00:14:01,963
Get way more drunk.

384
00:14:03,867 --> 00:14:06,063
Dong, dong, dong.

385
00:14:06,188 --> 00:14:08,638
Between all the vodka we drank
and what Jay poured on the

386
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,759
ground in honor of dead
rappers, we were out of booze.

387
00:14:12,761 --> 00:14:16,396
But luckily I found a few bottles
my mom hadn't thrown at my dad.

388
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:18,031
Hey, when's the
MILF getting home?

389
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:18,982
Not until 6:00.

390
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:19,699
We're fine.

391
00:14:19,701 --> 00:14:21,618
No, I wasn't afraid
of getting caught.

392
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,704
I was asking because I want to
go through her panty drawer.

393
00:14:24,706 --> 00:14:26,039
I'm guessing all thongs.

394
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,074
Or crotch-less teddies.

395
00:14:28,961 --> 00:14:29,626
Please stop.

396
00:14:29,628 --> 00:14:31,077
You should be proud, Will.

397
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,346
None of our moms are attractive.

398
00:14:33,348 --> 00:14:35,048
I can barely look at mine.

399
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:35,966
Neither can you dad.

400
00:14:37,118 --> 00:14:37,834
What?

401
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:38,919
My dad's not gay.

402
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:40,387
Then why did your mom leave him?

403
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:41,454
Because they have issues.

404
00:14:41,456 --> 00:14:43,056
He needed some space.

405
00:14:43,058 --> 00:14:44,424
Space for another penis.

406
00:14:46,812 --> 00:14:48,762
Okay, I'm not sure the gold
flakes are supposed to be in

407
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:51,982
there, so try and
drink around them.

408
00:14:51,984 --> 00:14:52,866
Great.

409
00:14:52,868 --> 00:14:54,067
So what do I do tonight?

410
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:55,368
I need a plan.

411
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,002
Easy.

412
00:14:56,004 --> 00:14:57,904
You bring one of us along to
watch the little brother,

413
00:14:57,906 --> 00:15:00,607
and then you and Carly go at it,
and I'm thinking you take me.

414
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:03,109
Dude, she might want double
penetration, and I'm the only

415
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,512
one with experience
in both holes.

416
00:15:05,514 --> 00:15:06,830
Ill.

417
00:15:06,832 --> 00:15:09,699
What?

418
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:14,320
So after three hours of drinking what
tasted like mouthwash and formaldehyde,

419
00:15:14,322 --> 00:15:17,657
Simon was ready.

420
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:18,341
Hi.

421
00:15:18,343 --> 00:15:19,125
Hi.

422
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,326
Hello.

423
00:15:20,328 --> 00:15:21,127
Oh, hey.

424
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,963
Will, right?

425
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:23,930
Is he your chaperone?

426
00:15:23,932 --> 00:15:25,164
Uh, it's cool, baby.

427
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:28,368
He's just here to look after your
brother while we chat, you know?

428
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,103
About our feelings.

429
00:15:30,105 --> 00:15:31,137
Hmm.

430
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,806
Let's not call me
"baby," though.

431
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:33,523
Really?

432
00:15:33,525 --> 00:15:34,190
Come in.

433
00:15:34,192 --> 00:15:36,977
I was just about
to grab a drink.

434
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:43,366
Dylan's in the TV room, Will.

435
00:15:43,368 --> 00:15:45,568
Dad totally lost it when
he saw the driveway.

436
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,737
He's gonna make your parents
pay for a stone cleaner.

437
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:48,872
It's worth it.

438
00:15:48,874 --> 00:15:50,373
Do you smell windex?

439
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,958
God, I really hate
that smell, you know.

440
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,993
Shh.

441
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:53,660
Ew.

442
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:54,377
Is it you?

443
00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:55,912
What have you been drinking?

444
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:56,579
Shoot.

445
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,798
My manners.

446
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,633
You want some?

447
00:15:59,635 --> 00:16:00,417
Oh, God.

448
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:02,385
What homeless guy did
you steal that from?

449
00:16:02,387 --> 00:16:04,170
I think I'll stick with wine.

450
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:05,388
Wine's for girls.

451
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,673
I am a girl.

452
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:10,393
Well, I'm a man, and this is a man's
drink, and if you can't take me like

453
00:16:10,395 --> 00:16:12,145
this, then I'm sorry, baby.

454
00:16:12,147 --> 00:16:14,147
But this is the package.

455
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,612
Oh, I've seen this one.

456
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:32,532
It's about what would happen if
a chemical bomb hit the city.

457
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:37,092
Streets would pile up with corpses,
stacked up on the curb like recs.

458
00:16:37,094 --> 00:16:39,511
My parents are in the city.

459
00:16:39,513 --> 00:16:41,479
Would they be killed?

460
00:16:41,481 --> 00:16:42,514
Yep.

461
00:16:42,516 --> 00:16:43,915
Stacked up on a curb.

462
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:45,550
My mom and dad are dead?

463
00:16:45,552 --> 00:16:47,519
What?

464
00:16:47,521 --> 00:16:49,053
Come on.

465
00:16:49,055 --> 00:16:53,074
You know why I'm here, and I know why
I'm here, and you know why I'm here.

466
00:16:53,076 --> 00:16:53,992
Just kiss me.

467
00:16:53,994 --> 00:16:56,027
Simon, you know I
have a boyfriend.

468
00:16:56,029 --> 00:16:57,562
But we're meant to be together.

469
00:16:57,564 --> 00:16:59,781
Come on, let's just renob.

470
00:16:59,783 --> 00:17:01,399
What?

471
00:17:01,401 --> 00:17:02,617
Sex me.

472
00:17:02,619 --> 00:17:03,919
Jesus, Simon.

473
00:17:05,005 --> 00:17:05,670
Simon?

474
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,839
Are you all right?

475
00:17:07,841 --> 00:17:08,707
Oh,.

476
00:17:10,711 --> 00:17:16,581
Oh... I don't feel very...

477
00:17:19,136 --> 00:17:21,219
Dylan!

478
00:17:21,221 --> 00:17:29,294
Ooh.

479
00:17:29,296 --> 00:17:31,646
Look, I'm very sorry.

480
00:17:31,648 --> 00:17:33,782
I--good, still warm.

481
00:17:33,784 --> 00:17:37,152
Um, I was just explaining the effects
of chemical warfare.

482
00:17:37,154 --> 00:17:38,286
To an eight-year-old?

483
00:17:38,288 --> 00:17:40,672
He won't sleep for a
week now, you idiot.

484
00:17:40,674 --> 00:17:42,007
I am really sorry.

485
00:17:42,009 --> 00:17:44,159
I think I ate something.

486
00:17:44,161 --> 00:17:49,581
Maybe we could just sit down and we
could talk about us and...

487
00:17:51,468 --> 00:17:53,468
I think we'll be going now.

488
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:54,636
Oh, no.

489
00:17:54,638 --> 00:17:56,638
Oh, no.

490
00:17:57,877 --> 00:18:00,827
<i>Though the night was a
complete disaster, it actually</i>

491
00:18:00,947 --> 00:18:03,943
<i>brought the two of us closer--
friends forged out of failure.</i>

492
00:18:04,063 --> 00:18:06,667
<i>We were the golden flakes
floating in the pool of vomit,</i>

493
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,901
<i>and there was comfort knowing it
would never get any worse than this.</i>

494
00:18:10,021 --> 00:18:11,605
<i>Is that your mom's car?</i>

495
00:18:12,772 --> 00:18:15,068
<i>I stand corrected.</i>

496
00:18:15,321 --> 00:18:18,126
<i>I mean, did you think the
school wouldn't call us, Simon?</i>

497
00:18:18,246 --> 00:18:20,817
<i>And why do you smell like
vomit and cheap alcohol?</i>

498
00:18:20,937 --> 00:18:21,628
<i>Wasn't cheap.</i>

499
00:18:21,748 --> 00:18:22,846
<i>It had gold in it.</i>

500
00:18:22,966 --> 00:18:26,239
<i>And you, Will, you've never
done anything irresponsible.</i>

501
00:18:26,359 --> 00:18:28,048
<i>Now all of a sudden
you're skipping school?</i>

502
00:18:28,168 --> 00:18:30,169
<i>Why?</i>

503
00:18:32,389 --> 00:18:34,378
<i>I...</i>

504
00:18:37,055 --> 00:18:39,198
It was all my idea.

505
00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:42,256
<i>I couldn't go back to school.</i>

506
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,287
<i>I'm getting bullied again, mom.</i>

507
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,706
<i>It's happening all over again.</i>

508
00:19:04,245 --> 00:19:07,175
<i>So I think it's safe to say
public school is going to work out fine.</i>

509
00:19:07,295 --> 00:19:10,088
<i>I have three friends that seem
to accept me, and a lifetime</i>

510
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:14,210
<i>of superior private education to get me out
of any jam this environment can present.</i>

511
00:19:18,303 --> 00:19:21,038
<i>Who knows, I might
even get laid.</i>

512
00:19:21,392 --> 00:19:23,612
<i>Morning, students.</i>

513
00:19:23,732 --> 00:19:28,152
<i>First off I want to report
that we have had a formal suit</i>

514
00:19:28,272 --> 00:19:31,678
<i>filed by the mother of William
Mackenzie regarding his</i>

515
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:33,659
<i>treatment by the student body.</i>

516
00:19:34,255 --> 00:19:37,675
<i>Let me just say this, any
student caught bullying him</i>

517
00:19:37,795 --> 00:19:41,629
<i>or causing him any emotional
or physical distress will be</i>

518
00:19:41,749 --> 00:19:46,343
<i>severely disciplined by the school and
possibly outside law enforcement.</i>

519
00:19:46,673 --> 00:19:49,646
<i>Will is a good boy with
a great big heart.</i>

520
00:19:49,766 --> 00:19:54,019
<i>Even though his body isn't maturing
as fast as others might be...</i>

521
00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:57,843
<i>He deserves your respect.</i>

522
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:09,085
<i>Then again, I'm a [bleep] idiot.</i>

523
00:20:50,537 --> 00:21:00,684
