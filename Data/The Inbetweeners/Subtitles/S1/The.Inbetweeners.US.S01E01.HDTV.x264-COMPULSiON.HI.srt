00:00:00,774 --> 00:00:06,215
My name is Will Mackenzie, and
these are my closest friends.

2
00:00:06,217 --> 00:00:08,101
So you're sticking
with the briefcase.

3
00:00:08,103 --> 00:00:09,469
It's a messenger bag.

4
00:00:09,471 --> 00:00:10,687
It's definitely a briefcase.

5
00:00:10,689 --> 00:00:12,338
Or a purse.

6
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,307
Well, my last school
discouraged backpacks.

7
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:16,059
They don't want us to look
like a bunch of ninja turtles.

8
00:00:16,061 --> 00:00:18,061
They wanted you to
look like dickheads?

9
00:00:18,063 --> 00:00:23,483
I've known them since yesterday,
which is also when I met

10
00:00:23,485 --> 00:00:26,685
the school's vice principal.

11
00:00:26,687 --> 00:00:28,905
Simon.

12
00:00:28,907 --> 00:00:30,189
Come here.

13
00:00:30,191 --> 00:00:32,691
This right here is
William Mackenzie.

14
00:00:32,693 --> 00:00:36,412
He is just transferred here, and you
have been selected to show him around.

15
00:00:36,414 --> 00:00:37,080
What?

16
00:00:37,082 --> 00:00:37,880
Why me?

17
00:00:37,882 --> 00:00:39,365
Because you were standing
closest to the door.

18
00:00:39,367 --> 00:00:40,032
What is that?

19
00:00:40,034 --> 00:00:40,699
A briefcase?

20
00:00:40,701 --> 00:00:41,467
It's a messenger bag.

21
00:00:41,469 --> 00:00:43,920
Oh, is it delivering the
message "My mom dressed me"?

22
00:00:43,922 --> 00:00:46,255
[Laughter]

23
00:00:46,257 --> 00:00:49,559
He's like a miniature
grown-up, but full-sized.

24
00:00:49,561 --> 00:00:50,593
[Laughter]

25
00:00:50,595 --> 00:00:51,260
Stop it.

26
00:00:51,262 --> 00:00:53,062
Why do I have to
show him around?

27
00:00:53,064 --> 00:00:55,581
Because William suffered from
bulling issues at his last school.

28
00:00:55,583 --> 00:00:56,232
What?

29
00:00:56,234 --> 00:00:57,350
[Snickers]

30
00:00:57,352 --> 00:00:58,551
No, I didn't.

31
00:00:58,553 --> 00:01:00,052
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

32
00:01:00,054 --> 00:01:04,323
Sorry, but it is, and I wasn't, so...
It was your face, I bet.

33
00:01:04,325 --> 00:01:09,112
You know, you do have one of those faces
that just makes people wanna... boom.

34
00:01:09,114 --> 00:01:09,779
What?

35
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:11,197
Nothing.

36
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:13,499
Welcome to grove high.

37
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:15,435
Get to class!

[Paper rips]

39
00:01:21,709 --> 00:01:24,594
It wasn't my idea to transfer here...
[Imitates explosion]

40
00:01:24,596 --> 00:01:26,779
But it also wasn't my idea
for my dad to run off

41
00:01:26,781 --> 00:01:30,316
with his secretary and leave my mom with
no way to pay my private school fees.

42
00:01:30,318 --> 00:01:33,519
But this place is real and
try to put a fee on that.

43
00:01:33,521 --> 00:01:35,521
Oh, I think these are
my sister's pants.

44
00:01:35,523 --> 00:01:38,090
Yeah, I wasn't gonna say anything, but
you have a rhinestone butterfly on

00:01:38,092 --> 00:01:38,757
the back.

46
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:42,145
Oh, son of a bitch.

47
00:01:42,147 --> 00:01:43,095
All right, there's carly.

48
00:01:43,097 --> 00:01:44,063
Give it.

49
00:01:44,065 --> 00:01:45,148
Give me the ball.

50
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:47,366
You really think throwing a
football will make a girl like you?

51
00:01:47,368 --> 00:01:48,367
Yeah.

52
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:49,986
It makes her see
him as an athlete.

53
00:01:49,988 --> 00:01:51,537
It's subliminal advertising.

54
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:53,573
It's the opposite of
subliminal, actually.

55
00:01:53,575 --> 00:01:54,240
It's true.

56
00:01:54,242 --> 00:01:54,907
It's liminal.

57
00:01:54,909 --> 00:01:56,209
Not a word.

58
00:01:56,211 --> 00:01:59,045
You know we don't
like you, right?

59

And as I came from a school
where popularity was determined

60
00:02:04,952 --> 00:02:10,890
by how early you got into Harvard...
You see that throw?

61
00:02:10,892 --> 00:02:17,296
It was nice to be somewhere you could
have it by throwing a football.

62
00:02:17,298 --> 00:02:19,932
Oh!

00:02:43,162 --> 00:02:49,862
About how different public schools
work, especially the toilets,

70
00:02:49,864 --> 00:02:52,732
which have no doors on them
to discourage drug use.

71
00:02:52,734 --> 00:02:57,937
This also, curiously enough,
discourages [bleep].

72
00:02:57,939 --> 00:03:01,557
But at least I got to spend some
more time with my new friends.

I'm telling you guys, I spent the
entire summer trapping beaver.

75
00:03:05,947 --> 00:03:08,614
Okay, that's the thing about RV
girls, is that they all have

76
00:03:08,616 --> 00:03:09,899
the same thing in common.

77
00:03:09,901 --> 00:03:10,616
They're poor?

No, these girls are sluts, dude, and
they'll do it to you for hours.

Really?

81
00:03:17,742 --> 00:03:19,325
So what is the best
way to do it, then?

82
00:03:19,327 --> 00:03:20,126
Deep.

83
00:03:20,128 --> 00:03:21,861
Just like real
deep to the balls.

84
00:03:21,863 --> 00:03:23,162

What?

00:03:24,499 --> 00:03:27,366
I heard you gotta put your balls in
if you really want to get a girl off.

87
00:03:27,368 --> 00:03:28,701
Yeah, you can.

88
00:03:28,703 --> 00:03:29,368
It's preference.

89
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:30,036
Some girls like it.

90
00:03:30,038 --> 00:03:31,270
Some girls don't.

91
00:03:31,272 --> 00:03:34,140

go in past the balls.

Yes, it does.

94

00:12:31,124 --> 00:12:32,206
Oh, yeah, man.

357
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:33,207
Super cool.

358
00:12:33,209 --> 00:12:34,292
It's so cool.

359
00:12:34,294 --> 00:12:36,644
I think writing her last name
is especially important,

360
00:12:36,646 --> 00:12:37,512
even though it's her driveway.

361
00:12:37,514 --> 00:12:38,346
What the hell is that?

362
00:12:38,348 --> 00:12:40,131
What?

363
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:40,798
Simon?

364
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,433
Why are you spray-painting
my driveway?

365
00:12:42,435 --> 00:12:45,419
Um... what is it-- you love me?

366
00:12:45,421 --> 00:12:47,388
[Laughter]

367
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:49,691
I can easily wash this off,
and we can pretend this never

368
00:12:49,693 --> 00:12:51,893
happened, and you could not
tell anyone, and I could not

369
00:12:51,895 --> 00:12:54,262
tell anyone, and your friends
could not tell anyone.

370
00:12:54,264 --> 00:12:56,197
Oh, I'm telling everyone.

371
00:12:56,199 --> 00:12:59,901
Simon, we've known each
other since we were eight.

372
00:12:59,903 --> 00:13:01,819
Why are you doing this now?

373
00:13:01,821 --> 00:13:03,404
I--it was a dare.

374
00:13:03,406 --> 00:13:04,872
So what then?

375
00:13:04,874 --> 00:13:06,541
You're in love with me?

376
00:13:06,543 --> 00:13:09,794
Maybe we could just talk
about this another time.

377
00:13:09,796 --> 00:13:11,295
This couldn't have
gone any better.

378
00:13:11,297 --> 00:13:13,131
[Laughter]

379
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:15,633
She doesn't love you, man.

380
00:13:15,635 --> 00:13:17,301
You wasted all that paint.

381
00:13:17,303 --> 00:13:19,387
[Laughter]

382
00:13:19,389 --> 00:13:21,956
Actually I think this is cool.

383
00:13:21,958 --> 00:13:25,176
It's like some underground
graffiti artist thing.

384
00:13:25,178 --> 00:13:26,644
Wait, huh?

385
00:13:26,646 --> 00:13:27,395
Yeah, you know what?

386
00:13:27,397 --> 00:13:28,262
Why don't you come over later?

387
00:13:28,264 --> 00:13:29,814
I'm babysitting my brother.

388
00:13:29,816 --> 00:13:30,598
We can talk about it then.

389
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,232
Really?

390
00:13:31,234 --> 00:13:32,767
Come after 8:00, 'cause
my parents will be gone

391
00:13:32,769 --> 00:13:36,487
by then, and you should probably
avoid them until this washes off.

392
00:13:36,489 --> 00:13:38,039
Not sure it washes off.

393
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:40,942
See you tonight.

394
00:13:40,944 --> 00:13:43,828
I-- I can't believe that worked.

395
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:44,862
I second that.

396
00:13:44,864 --> 00:13:46,414
Dude, it's because
you're so drunk.

397
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,281
You're like Kurt Cobain.

398
00:13:47,283 --> 00:13:49,050
I think he was on heroin.

399
00:13:49,052 --> 00:13:50,018
Do I have to do heroin?

400
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,952
Probably won't hurt.

401
00:13:50,954 --> 00:13:53,454
Well, it's really hard to
find, and I don't want to dip

402
00:13:53,456 --> 00:13:57,091
into my personal stash, so... okay,
so what do I do about tonight?

403
00:13:57,093 --> 00:13:59,961
Easy.

404
00:13:59,963 --> 00:14:01,963
Get way more drunk.

405
00:14:03,867 --> 00:14:06,063
Dong, dong, dong.

406
00:14:06,188 --> 00:14:08,638
Between all the vodka we drank
and what Jay poured on the

407
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,759
ground in honor of dead
rappers, we were out of booze.

408
00:14:12,761 --> 00:14:16,396
But luckily I found a few bottles
my mom hadn't thrown at my dad.

409
00:14:16,398 --> 00:14:18,031
Hey, when's the
MILF getting home?

410
00:14:18,033 --> 00:14:18,982
Not until 6:00.

411
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:19,699
We're fine.

412
00:14:19,701 --> 00:14:21,618
No, I wasn't afraid
of getting caught.

413
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,704
I was asking because I want to
go through her panty drawer.

414
00:14:24,706 --> 00:14:26,039
I'm guessing all thongs.

415
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:28,074
Or crotch-less teddies.

416
00:14:28,076 --> 00:14:28,959
[Chuckles]

417
00:14:28,961 --> 00:14:29,626
Please stop.

418
00:14:29,628 --> 00:14:31,077
You should be proud, Will.

419
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,346
None of our moms are attractive.

420
00:14:33,348 --> 00:14:35,048
I can barely look at mine.

421
00:14:35,050 --> 00:14:35,966
Neither can you dad.

422
00:14:35,968 --> 00:14:37,116
[Snickers]

423
00:14:37,118 --> 00:14:37,834
What?

424
00:14:37,836 --> 00:14:38,919
My dad's not gay.

425
00:14:38,921 --> 00:14:40,387
Then why did your mom leave him?

426
00:14:40,389 --> 00:14:41,454
Because they have issues.

427
00:14:41,456 --> 00:14:43,056
He needed some space.

428
00:14:43,058 --> 00:14:44,424
Space for another penis.

429
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:46,810
[Laughter]

430
00:14:46,812 --> 00:14:48,762
Okay, I'm not sure the gold
flakes are supposed to be in

431
00:14:48,764 --> 00:14:51,982
there, so try and
drink around them.

432
00:14:51,984 --> 00:14:52,866
Great.

433
00:14:52,868 --> 00:14:54,067
So what do I do tonight?

434
00:14:54,069 --> 00:14:55,368
I need a plan.

435
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,002
Easy.

436
00:14:56,004 --> 00:14:57,904
You bring one of us along to
watch the little brother,

437
00:14:57,906 --> 00:15:00,607
and then you and Carly go at it,
and I'm thinking you take me.

438
00:15:00,609 --> 00:15:03,109
Dude, she might want double
penetration, and I'm the only

439
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:05,512
one with experience
in both holes.

440
00:15:05,514 --> 00:15:06,830
Ill.

441
00:15:06,832 --> 00:15:09,699
What?

442
00:15:09,701 --> 00:15:14,320
So after three hours of drinking what
tasted like mouthwash and formaldehyde,

443
00:15:14,322 --> 00:15:17,657
Simon was ready.

444
00:15:17,659 --> 00:15:18,341
Hi.

445
00:15:18,343 --> 00:15:19,125
Hi.

446
00:15:19,127 --> 00:15:20,326
Hello.

447
00:15:20,328 --> 00:15:21,127
Oh, hey.

448
00:15:21,129 --> 00:15:22,963
Will, right?

449
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:23,930
Is he your chaperone?

450
00:15:23,932 --> 00:15:25,164
Uh, it's cool, baby.

451
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:28,368
He's just here to look after your
brother while we chat, you know?

452
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:30,103
About our feelings.

453
00:15:30,105 --> 00:15:31,137
Hmm.

454
00:15:31,139 --> 00:15:32,806
Let's not call me
"baby," though.

455
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:33,523
Really?

456
00:15:33,525 --> 00:15:34,190
Come in.

457
00:15:34,192 --> 00:15:36,977
I was just about
to grab a drink.

458
00:15:36,979 --> 00:15:43,366
Dylan's in the TV room, Will.

459
00:15:43,368 --> 00:15:45,568
Dad totally lost it when
he saw the driveway.

460
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:47,737
He's gonna make your parents
pay for a stone cleaner.

461
00:15:47,739 --> 00:15:48,872
It's worth it.

462
00:15:48,874 --> 00:15:50,373
Do you smell windex?

463
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:51,958
God, I really hate
that smell, you know.

464
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,993
Shh.

465
00:15:52,995 --> 00:15:53,660
Ew.

466
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:54,377
Is it you?

467
00:15:54,379 --> 00:15:55,912
What have you been drinking?

468
00:15:55,914 --> 00:15:56,579
Shoot.

469
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,798
My manners.

470
00:15:58,800 --> 00:15:59,633
You want some?

471
00:15:59,635 --> 00:16:00,417
Oh, God.

472
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:02,385
What homeless guy did
you steal that from?

473
00:16:02,387 --> 00:16:04,170
I think I'll stick with wine.

474
00:16:04,172 --> 00:16:05,388
Wine's for girls.

475
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:06,673
I am a girl.

476
00:16:06,675 --> 00:16:10,393
Well, I'm a man, and this is a man's
drink, and if you can't take me like

477
00:16:10,395 --> 00:16:12,145
this, then I'm sorry, baby.

478
00:16:12,147 --> 00:16:14,147
But this is the package.

[Boom]

481
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,612
Oh, I've seen this one.

482
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:32,532
It's about what would happen if
a chemical bomb hit the city.

483
00:16:32,534 --> 00:16:37,092
Streets would pile up with corpses,
stacked up on the curb like recs.

484
00:16:37,094 --> 00:16:39,511
My parents are in the city.

485
00:16:39,513 --> 00:16:41,479
Would they be killed?

486
00:16:41,481 --> 00:16:42,514
Yep.

487
00:16:42,516 --> 00:16:43,915
Stacked up on a curb.

488
00:16:43,917 --> 00:16:45,550
My mom and dad are dead?

What?

You know why I'm here, and I know why
I'm here, and you know why I'm here.

00:16:53,076 --> 00:16:53,992
Just kiss me.

have a boyfriend.

00:18:39,871 --> 00:18:42,256
<i>I couldn't go back to school.</i>

538
00:18:43,410 --> 00:18:45,287
<i>I'm getting bullied again, mom.</i>

539
00:18:45,757 --> 00:18:47,706
<i>It's happening all over again.</i>

540
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:52,546
<i>[Crying]</i>

541
00:19:04,245 --> 00:19:07,175
<i>So I think it's safe to say
public school is going to work out fine.</i>

542
00:19:07,295 --> 00:19:10,088
<i>I have three friends that seem
to accept me, and a lifetime</i>

543
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:14,210
<i>of superior private education to get me out
of any jam this environment can present.</i>

544
00:19:18,303 --> 00:19:21,038
<i>Who knows, I might
even get laid.</i>

545
00:19:21,392 --> 00:19:23,612
<i>Morning, students.</i>

546
00:19:23,732 --> 00:19:28,152
<i>First off I want to report
that we have had a formal suit</i>

547
00:19:28,272 --> 00:19:31,678
<i>filed by the mother of William
Mackenzie regarding his</i>

548
00:19:31,798 --> 00:19:33,659
<i>treatment by the student body.</i>

549
00:19:34,255 --> 00:19:37,675
<i>Let me just say this, any
student caught bullying him</i>

550
00:19:37,795 --> 00:19:41,629
<i>or causing him any emotional
or physical distress will be</i>

551
00:19:41,749 --> 00:19:46,343
<i>severely disciplined by the school and
possibly outside law enforcement.</i>

552
00:19:46,673 --> 00:19:49,646
<i>Will is a good boy with
a great big heart.</i>

553
00:19:49,766 --> 00:19:54,019
<i>Even though his body isn't maturing
as fast as others might be...</i>

554
00:19:54,139 --> 00:19:57,843
<i>He deserves your respect.</i>

555
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:03,317
<i>[Laughter]</i>

556
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:09,085
<i>Then again, I'm a [bleep] idiot.</i>

557
00:20:44,258 --> 00:20:46,719
<i>[glass shatters]</i>

558
00:20:46,839 --> 00:20:49,746
<i>[Laughter]</i>
