00:00:00,368 --> 00:00:03,813
So far this year, Simon's pursuit of
carly hadn't been going that well.

00:00:05,141 --> 00:00:07,141

00:00:07,143 --> 00:00:08,192
Or stay the same.

homeless person's shoes?

00:00:10,563 --> 00:00:12,146
Uh...
Or get worse.

it bad, at least he wasn't

Good one, Donovan.

Don't talk to me.

15
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:27,578

17
00:00:28,706 --> 00:00:31,090

18
00:00:31,092 --> 00:00:32,163
Ow. Ow.

19
00:00:32,283 --> 00:00:36,095
Could someone other than Neil help me?

20
00:00:36,097 --> 00:00:37,213
Oh, sorry, Will.

21
00:00:37,215 --> 00:00:39,081
Donovan won't allow it.

22
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:40,466

23
00:00:40,468 --> 00:00:42,218
So what are we up to this weekend?

24
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,520
I don't know about you guys, but
I'm gonna go to an RV resort

25
00:00:44,522 --> 00:00:47,723

womb raider with my dong.

[Laughter]

27
00:00:48,976 --> 00:00:51,310
Right, anyone doing something
not made up this weekend?

28
00:00:51,312 --> 00:00:53,646
It's not made up, bucket.

30
00:00:54,699 --> 00:00:56,098
I would have just gone
with bucket head.

31

Ah, sorry.

lady caves I'm gonna be spelunking...

add that to anything.

All right, I'm in.

45
00:01:18,423 --> 00:01:19,922

00:01:40,161 --> 00:01:42,161
Yeah, Jay's taking us to an RV park.

63
00:01:42,163 --> 00:01:43,446
RV resort.

64
00:01:43,448 --> 00:01:44,413
Oh, right.

65
00:01:44,415 --> 00:01:45,915
It's not a place poor people live.

66

It's a place poor people visit.

67

But if you want to do
something, I can get out of it.

68

An RV resort sounds awful.

69
00:01:52,457 --> 00:01:53,822
Oh, I think it sounds fun.

70
00:01:53,824 --> 00:01:54,490
It will be.

71
00:01:54,492 --> 00:01:55,174
You should come.

72
00:01:55,176 --> 00:01:56,675
Oh, sorry, I can't.

73
00:01:56,677 --> 00:01:58,043
Bobby's taking me free climbing.

74
00:01:58,045 --> 00:02:00,596
It's his big passion, so
he wants to teach me.

75
00:02:00,598 --> 00:02:01,263
Wow.

76
00:02:01,265 --> 00:02:02,381

00:02:02,383 --> 00:02:03,299
Mm-hmm.

hang out on the ground and watch him fall.

81
00:02:14,678 --> 00:02:18,514
They're doing extreme sports together?

82
00:02:18,516 --> 00:02:19,815
I can't compete with that.

83
00:02:19,817 --> 00:02:21,517
Don't compete, okay?

84
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:24,236

other girl on your dipstick.

I don't know if I can.

86
00:02:25,957 --> 00:02:28,290
But going to an RV park is
better than sitting in my

about her all weekend.

88
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:31,994
So you guys are really gonna come?

00:02:31,996 --> 00:02:32,828
Yeah.

00:02:40,254 --> 00:02:41,637
That was the best one so far.

95
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:42,304
But do you get it?

96
00:02:42,306 --> 00:02:44,890
Stop it!

I think we should stop
and get some gas.

Now it's on.

20 miles left in the tank.

have one gallon left.

you're going under 60 miles an hour--

00:12:58,350 --> 00:12:59,415
I'm Simon's wing man.

367
00:12:59,417 --> 00:13:01,017
I take that job very seriously.

368
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:02,552
You don't have to lie to me, son.

369
00:13:02,554 --> 00:13:06,639
With your looks, I'd have taken
the fatties a long time ago.

370
00:13:06,641 --> 00:13:07,941
How's your night going?

371
00:13:07,943 --> 00:13:09,258
Better than Jay's, I hope.

372
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:11,528
I made out with a girl who
licked hummus off my vest.

373
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:13,146
Atta boy!

374
00:13:13,148 --> 00:13:14,314
And kinky.

375
00:13:14,316 --> 00:13:15,482
Oh, see you that, Jay?

376
00:13:15,484 --> 00:13:18,618
Even Will's getting some.

377
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:24,324
How do you smell that
bad after a shower?

378
00:13:24,326 --> 00:13:26,826
Ugh.

379
00:13:31,972 --> 00:13:33,282
[Chuckles]

380
00:13:33,284 --> 00:13:35,585
Kissed so good, it knocked
your socks off, huh?

381
00:13:35,587 --> 00:13:38,121
[Laughs]

382
00:13:38,123 --> 00:13:39,556
Yeah, I know it's not a perfect joke.

383
00:13:39,558 --> 00:13:42,125
You still got your socks on, but...
You're actually getting

384
00:13:42,127 --> 00:13:44,293
a little bit--
You're, uh... right?

385
00:13:44,295 --> 00:13:45,395
Atta boy.

386
00:13:45,397 --> 00:13:48,131
[Splashing]

387
00:13:48,133 --> 00:13:49,766
You got stage fright there?

388
00:13:58,309 --> 00:14:02,779
Maybe we should go somewhere more...
Just somewhere else.

389
00:14:02,781 --> 00:14:08,251
I got to go to the bathroom, but
meet me outside in five minutes?

390
00:14:30,142 --> 00:14:32,108
[Sighs]

391
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,610
Is this seat taken?

392
00:14:33,612 --> 00:14:37,280
It is now.

393
00:14:37,282 --> 00:14:38,014
It's a nice night.

394
00:14:38,016 --> 00:14:39,015
Yeah.

395
00:14:39,017 --> 00:14:40,183
Both: Full moon.

396
00:14:40,185 --> 00:14:42,185
[Chuckle]

397
00:14:42,187 --> 00:14:45,989
Twilight.

398
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,973
You want to take this
to the next level?

399
00:15:03,975 --> 00:15:04,707
What?

400
00:15:04,709 --> 00:15:07,010
Yeah. Yes.

401
00:15:07,012 --> 00:15:09,729
Absolutely.

402
00:15:14,326 --> 00:15:16,601
Mmm.

403
00:15:16,721 --> 00:15:18,688
You like that?

404
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:20,824
This feel good?

405
00:15:20,826 --> 00:15:22,408
I think we make a good couple.

406
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:25,445
[Chuckles nervously]

407
00:15:25,447 --> 00:15:27,497
I like this.

408
00:15:27,499 --> 00:15:29,582
What are you doing?

409
00:15:29,584 --> 00:15:32,252
Next level?

410
00:15:32,254 --> 00:15:34,838
That is my stomach.

411
00:15:38,807 --> 00:15:41,794
Second base.

412
00:15:46,648 --> 00:15:48,434
Oh.

413
00:15:48,436 --> 00:15:51,771
Let me just get this.

414
00:15:58,949 --> 00:16:00,480
What is that?

415
00:16:00,482 --> 00:16:02,432
A condom.

416
00:16:02,434 --> 00:16:04,334
Why are you wearing a condom?

417
00:16:04,336 --> 00:16:06,953
For protection.

418
00:16:06,955 --> 00:16:07,904
And luck?

419
00:16:07,906 --> 00:16:09,622
What?

420
00:16:09,624 --> 00:16:11,541
Jay said--
What did Jay say?

421
00:16:11,543 --> 00:16:12,492
You like sex.

422
00:16:12,494 --> 00:16:15,295
I am not having sex with you.

423
00:16:15,297 --> 00:16:16,779
Back door?

424
00:16:16,781 --> 00:16:17,872
Oh...

425
00:16:20,118 --> 00:16:21,266
I'm learning your tricks.

426
00:16:21,386 --> 00:16:22,618
Will, what are you doing?

427
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,386
We got to go.

428
00:16:23,388 --> 00:16:24,337
Stop playing around.

429
00:16:24,339 --> 00:16:25,121
Oh, yeah.

430
00:16:25,123 --> 00:16:25,955
You nailed it, Jay.

431
00:16:25,957 --> 00:16:27,473
That's exactly what I'm doing.

432
00:16:27,475 --> 00:16:29,893
Playing around with your
father's urine coating my socks.

433
00:16:29,895 --> 00:16:31,183
Yeah. What?

434
00:16:32,981 --> 00:16:34,430
[Chuckles]

435
00:16:34,432 --> 00:16:35,265
Got you now.

436
00:16:35,267 --> 00:16:36,349
Who's immature now?

437
00:16:36,351 --> 00:16:37,267
Eat it!

438
00:16:37,269 --> 00:16:38,568
Eat my foot.

439
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,769
Relax.

440
00:16:39,771 --> 00:16:41,738
Relax.

[Breathing rhythmically]

442
00:16:44,976 --> 00:16:48,494
Hey, it's Simon.

443
00:16:48,496 --> 00:16:50,280
Hey, what's up, guys?

444
00:16:50,282 --> 00:16:51,047
You're such a liar!

445
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:51,748
What?

446
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:52,648
She likes sex?

447
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:53,833
Why would you say that?

448
00:16:53,835 --> 00:16:55,985
Uh, we had that one night together?

449
00:16:55,987 --> 00:16:56,819
What night?

450
00:16:56,821 --> 00:16:58,288
We had never had a night.

451
00:16:58,290 --> 00:16:59,872
We were so drunk.

452
00:16:59,874 --> 00:17:03,509
Stop lying.

453
00:17:03,511 --> 00:17:05,712
The legacy condom?

454
00:17:05,714 --> 00:17:07,297
What have you done?

455
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:09,599
Becky, you out here?

456
00:17:09,601 --> 00:17:10,883
He tried to back door me.

457
00:17:10,885 --> 00:17:11,801
And we're off.

458
00:17:11,803 --> 00:17:14,804
I want that condom back
in any condition, Simon.

459
00:17:14,806 --> 00:17:16,222
Any condition!

<i>Hey, boys.</i>

<i>So much for that.</i>

00:19:35,103 --> 00:19:38,221
<i>[Grunting]</i>

550
00:19:38,223 --> 00:19:39,472
<i>All over my pants!</i>

551
00:19:39,474 --> 00:19:41,274
<i>Clean out my car now!</i>

552
00:19:41,276 --> 00:19:42,358
<i>It's your car.</i>

553
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,110
<i>It's your stuff!</i>

554
00:19:44,112 --> 00:19:44,777
<i>That's gross.</i>

555
00:19:44,779 --> 00:19:46,178
<i>I don't even want to ride in it now.</i>

556
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:47,113
<i>You think I do?</i>

557
00:19:47,115 --> 00:19:47,897
<i>I told you.</i>

558
00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:49,649
<i>I told you you were
lying about RV resorts.</i>

559
00:19:49,651 --> 00:19:50,483
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

560
00:19:50,485 --> 00:19:53,202
<i>Neil got some action, didn't
he, that's soaked in my pants!</i>

561
00:19:53,204 --> 00:19:54,487
<i>That's not the point.</i>

562
00:19:54,489 --> 00:19:55,288
<i>You're still a liar.</i>

563
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:55,988
<i>Clean it up!</i>

564
00:19:55,990 --> 00:19:58,023
<i>I'm not going to because it's your car.</i>

565
00:19:58,025 --> 00:19:59,625
<i>I don't care.</i>

566
00:19:59,627 --> 00:20:02,912
<i>And in the end, everything was
pretty much back to normal.</i>

567
00:20:02,914 --> 00:20:05,798
<i>We were still virgins, Neil was
still doing inappropriate things</i>

568
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:09,535
<i>in Simon's car, and Jay was still Jay.</i>

569
00:20:11,233 --> 00:20:13,806
<i>I don't get a hand job!</i>

570
00:20:13,808 --> 00:20:15,808
<i>What are you doing?</i>

571
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,677
<i>What are you two doing?</i>

572
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:20,713
<i>Simon, move!</i>

573
00:20:20,715 --> 00:20:23,115
<i>I'm gonna [bleep] kill you!</i>

574
00:20:25,059 --> 00:20:28,354
Next on <i>The Inbetweeners...</i>
Schools from all over

575
00:20:28,356 --> 00:20:31,140
<i>the state descend on this battlefield.</i>

576
00:20:31,142 --> 00:20:33,776
<i>And I will descend on their ladies.</i>

577
00:20:33,778 --> 00:20:35,144
<i>The girl, who is she?</i>

578
00:20:35,146 --> 00:20:36,062
<i>New girl, I guess.</i>

579
00:20:36,064 --> 00:20:36,729
<i>Lauren?</i>

580
00:20:36,731 --> 00:20:37,613
<i>Lauren's great, isn't she?</i>

581
00:20:37,615 --> 00:20:38,965
<i>And I think she really likes me.</i>

582
00:20:38,967 --> 00:20:39,615
<i>Well, I saw her first.</i>

583
00:20:39,617 --> 00:20:41,697
<i>I think there's a party down the hall.</i>

584
00:20:41,817 --> 00:20:42,482
<i>You want to go?</i>

585
00:20:42,484 --> 00:20:43,314
<i>Yeah, sure.</i>
