1
00:00:00,215 --> 00:00:03,583
The first few weeks at my
new school hadn't gone well

2
00:00:03,585 --> 00:00:08,672
for either my popularity...

3
00:00:08,674 --> 00:00:10,623
Or Simon's pursuit of carly.

4
00:00:10,625 --> 00:00:11,808
You love me?

5
00:00:19,484 --> 00:00:20,567
Grove high school:

6
00:00:20,569 --> 00:00:26,139
A sea of jocks, nerds, criminals,
mothers-to-be, and everything in between.

7
00:00:26,141 --> 00:00:28,108
And when I say in
between, I mean me.

8
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:31,244
♪ Take me to the other side

9
00:00:31,246 --> 00:00:32,645
But I wasn't alone.

10
00:00:32,647 --> 00:00:35,365
I had these guys...

11
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:37,167
♪ Take me to the other side

12
00:00:37,169 --> 00:00:39,169
...which admittedly wasn't much.

13
00:00:39,171 --> 00:00:42,422
♪ Enjoy the ride
♪ I'm the poster child ♪

14
00:00:42,424 --> 00:00:45,008
♪ for the other side

15
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:47,344
But they were friends,

16
00:00:47,346 --> 00:00:48,828
partners on the turbulent road

17
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:49,763
to adulthood.

18
00:00:49,765 --> 00:00:51,131
Give you a dollar if you eat it.

19
00:00:51,133 --> 00:00:53,717
A road paved with stupidity
and embarrassment.

20
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:55,352
Is it cool if I pay
you in nickels?

21
00:00:55,354 --> 00:00:58,772
But thanks to Simon, a road
we could now drive on.

22
00:00:58,774 --> 00:00:59,439
Here we go.

23
00:00:59,441 --> 00:01:01,725
Took me a minute to get it
out of the display sleeve.

24
00:01:01,727 --> 00:01:03,509
I have the same
problem with my dong.

25
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:05,011
I can't believe you
can drive now.

26
00:01:05,013 --> 00:01:06,396
How are you a year
older than us?

27
00:01:06,398 --> 00:01:08,181
I got held back in kindergarten.

28
00:01:08,183 --> 00:01:10,400
My dad wanted me to be
more dominant in sports.

29
00:01:10,402 --> 00:01:11,284
Didn't work.

30
00:01:11,286 --> 00:01:12,535
I have brittle bones.

31
00:01:12,537 --> 00:01:14,871
My school tried to hold me
back every year, but my mom

32
00:01:14,873 --> 00:01:17,741
just changed the spelling of
my name and reenrolled me.

33
00:01:17,743 --> 00:01:19,626
How many different ways
are there to spell Neil?

34
00:01:19,628 --> 00:01:22,829
Oh, I wasn't Neil until
the sixth grade.

35
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:23,863
Jay, what are you doing?

36
00:01:23,865 --> 00:01:25,048
Making you over 21.

37
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,967
It's really easy when
you're born in 1995.

38
00:01:26,969 --> 00:01:29,002
All you do is change the nine into
an eight, and then you're a child

39
00:01:29,004 --> 00:01:29,669
of the '80s.

40
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:30,536
Flower power.

41
00:01:30,538 --> 00:01:32,872
Jay, I don't think that you--
Dude, I used to do this

42
00:01:32,874 --> 00:01:35,058
for a living until the
feds started tailing me.

43
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:35,976
On your bicycle?

44
00:01:35,978 --> 00:01:38,878
Well, I'm not gonna jack a
car with the feds on me.

45
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,814
Now, shut up so I
can concentrate.

46
00:01:40,816 --> 00:01:42,882
One false move and
this thing is ruined.

47
00:01:42,884 --> 00:01:43,549
What?

48
00:01:43,551 --> 00:01:45,218
Is your dad gonna hold
up his end of the deal?

49
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:47,854
Yeah, I passed my test, so he
said he's gonna get me a car.

50
00:01:47,856 --> 00:01:50,657
Oh, man, cars are the best
[bleep] magnets there are.

51
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:52,659
Get ready to troll for
some [bleep], boys.

52
00:01:52,661 --> 00:01:54,194
I'm bringing my stiffest rod.

53
00:01:54,196 --> 00:01:55,328
Ooh.

54
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,196
I'd like to get off the boat.

55
00:01:56,198 --> 00:01:57,831
Let me just ease it into a slip.

56
00:01:57,833 --> 00:01:58,564
Ooh.

57
00:01:58,566 --> 00:01:59,699
Man overboard.

58
00:01:59,701 --> 00:02:00,566
What kind of car is it?

59
00:02:00,568 --> 00:02:03,119
He wouldn't say, but he did
tell me it was a sport edition,

60
00:02:03,121 --> 00:02:05,171
and a sport edition of
anything is awesome.

61
00:02:05,173 --> 00:02:06,572
Dude, we should race it.

62
00:02:06,574 --> 00:02:07,257
Yeah.

63
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:08,508
What?

64
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:09,876
It's a car.

65
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:11,911
There's no way we'd win.

66
00:02:11,913 --> 00:02:12,929
What's wrong with you?

67
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:14,514
Nothing, where are my nickels?

68
00:02:14,516 --> 00:02:15,265
Here she is.

69
00:02:15,267 --> 00:02:17,884
Carly, the love of Simon's life.

70
00:02:17,886 --> 00:02:21,137
Unfortunately, she was going out with
Bobby watts, the love of her life.

71
00:02:21,139 --> 00:02:32,983

72
00:02:32,985 --> 00:02:34,117
I have a shot now, okay?

73
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:35,785
Having a car will level
the playing field.

74
00:02:35,787 --> 00:02:38,038
I don't think you could win
on a level playing field.

75
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,156
I think you need it slanted
dramatically in your direction.

76
00:02:40,158 --> 00:02:42,375
Yeah, anything level he's
just gonna bang her on.

77
00:02:43,328 --> 00:02:45,161
Hey, Simon.

78
00:02:45,163 --> 00:02:45,996
Hey.

79
00:02:45,998 --> 00:02:47,780
You know, if you ever need
a ride that moves a little

80
00:02:47,782 --> 00:02:50,116
faster, you can give me a call.

81
00:02:50,118 --> 00:02:50,884
Those your house keys?

82
00:02:50,886 --> 00:02:51,951
Shut up.

83
00:02:51,953 --> 00:02:53,086
Did you get a car?

84
00:02:53,088 --> 00:03:00,143
Nope, I got a sport edition
of a car--no, I got a car.

85
00:03:00,145 --> 00:03:01,478
You're doing great.

86
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,145
That's awesome.

87
00:03:02,147 --> 00:03:03,263
You passed your test.

88
00:03:03,265 --> 00:03:04,597
It was easy.

89
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,982
I was born driving.

90
00:03:05,984 --> 00:03:07,633
Eww, must have been
painful for your mom.

91
00:03:09,154 --> 00:03:10,636
We should grab a pizza
soon and celebrate.

92
00:03:10,638 --> 00:03:11,905
Yeah, what about tomorrow?

93
00:03:11,907 --> 00:03:13,273
Oh, I can't tomorrow.

94
00:03:13,275 --> 00:03:16,826
Bobby's taking me to Sunshine Mountain
for our two-month anniversary.

95
00:03:16,828 --> 00:03:19,746
Wow, it's a shame there's not an
anniversary for friends, huh?

96
00:03:19,748 --> 00:03:21,414
I'd have him beat by,
like, eight years.

97
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:22,665
Maybe we should make one up.

98
00:03:22,667 --> 00:03:23,983
Yeah, why not?

99
00:03:23,985 --> 00:03:25,035
You and Bobby did.

100
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:31,124
I'll see you guys later.

101
00:03:31,126 --> 00:03:33,877
Hey, if you're going to Sunshine
Mountain, I'll probably see you there.

102
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:35,828
I work weekends as
poncho the parrot.

103
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:39,632
So if a giant parrot hugs you,
it's me or my friend Toby.

104
00:03:39,634 --> 00:03:43,019
You work at Sunshine Mountain?

105
00:03:43,021 --> 00:03:46,005
Triple-inverted triscareatops
rollercoaster Sunshine Mountain?

106
00:03:46,007 --> 00:03:47,724
It's actually just called
Sunshine Mountain.

107
00:03:47,726 --> 00:03:49,192
Why don't we go there tomorrow?

108
00:03:49,194 --> 00:03:51,844
You could show Carly that you drive to
cool places just like Bobby, which will

109
00:03:51,846 --> 00:03:53,846
totally get into her head.

110
00:03:53,848 --> 00:03:54,781
You think so?

111
00:03:54,783 --> 00:03:59,569
Yes, psychological warfare always
works, plus we can ride that ride

112
00:03:59,571 --> 00:04:00,487
a few times.

113
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:01,538
I'm up for a road trip.

114
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,624
And now that you're over 21, we can
take a little swim in the beer garden.

115
00:04:05,293 --> 00:04:06,526
1895?

116
00:04:06,528 --> 00:04:07,193
What?

117
00:04:07,195 --> 00:04:08,194
You changed the wrong nine.

118
00:04:08,196 --> 00:04:10,363
You made me 117, you idiot!

119
00:04:16,838 --> 00:04:18,171
Where are you going?

120
00:04:18,173 --> 00:04:20,206
Jay!

121
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,509
Come here!

122
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:23,876
This is so awesome.

123
00:04:23,878 --> 00:04:25,929
I'll probably hear it
before I see it, huh?

124
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:26,879
V8?

125
00:04:26,881 --> 00:04:28,047
All I know is it is a Ford.

126
00:04:28,049 --> 00:04:28,714
A Ford?

127
00:04:28,716 --> 00:04:29,399
Yes.

128
00:04:29,401 --> 00:04:30,066
Yes.

129
00:04:30,735 --> 00:04:32,152
Mustang, I bet.

130
00:04:32,154 --> 00:04:32,819
Dad.

131
00:04:32,821 --> 00:04:34,270
Oh, I can't believe
you're getting a car.

132
00:04:34,272 --> 00:04:35,238
Such a waste.

133
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:38,608
What are you gonna do, take out that
fat redheaded girl you're always with?

134
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,392
That's Jay.

135
00:04:39,394 --> 00:04:42,162
Oh, must've been
thrown by his [bleep].

136
00:04:42,164 --> 00:04:42,862
Todd!

137
00:04:42,864 --> 00:04:43,696
It's fine, mom.

138
00:04:43,698 --> 00:04:45,165
It doesn't matter what he says.

139
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:46,232
I'm the one getting a new car.

140
00:04:48,903 --> 00:04:49,669
No!

141
00:04:49,671 --> 00:04:50,336
No!

142
00:04:51,673 --> 00:04:52,622
No, you can't be serious.

143
00:04:52,624 --> 00:04:53,590
It's cute.

144
00:04:53,592 --> 00:04:55,008
It's yellow like the sun.

145
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,926
Doesn't look like much,
but it runs great.

146
00:04:56,928 --> 00:04:58,344
Sport edition.

147
00:04:58,346 --> 00:05:00,013
Of what sport, ultimate frisbee?

148
00:05:00,015 --> 00:05:01,464
Could be a little
more grateful, Simon.

149
00:05:01,466 --> 00:05:04,467
It's a good starter car, and you won't
be able to get up enough speed in it

150
00:05:04,469 --> 00:05:05,385
to kill yourself.

151
00:05:05,387 --> 00:05:06,469
I'll find a way.

152
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:08,054
I'll find a way to
kill myself in it.

153
00:05:08,056 --> 00:05:08,855
Tell you what:

154
00:05:08,857 --> 00:05:12,142
You show me that you can take
care of this, and next summer

155
00:05:12,144 --> 00:05:13,693
we'll see if we can find
you an upgrade, eh?

156
00:05:13,695 --> 00:05:14,861
Fine.

157
00:05:14,863 --> 00:05:15,645
Thanks, I guess.

158
00:05:15,647 --> 00:05:16,596
You betcha.

159
00:05:16,598 --> 00:05:20,033
Hey, I made you a mix tape of
all the songs I used to cruise

160
00:05:20,035 --> 00:05:22,235
to when I was your age.

161
00:05:22,237 --> 00:05:23,620
It has a tape player?

162
00:05:23,622 --> 00:05:25,538
Hell yeah!

163
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:28,291
It's a sport edition.

164
00:05:28,293 --> 00:05:28,958
Dad.

165
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,547
♪ I want you to show me ♪

166
00:05:34,549 --> 00:05:36,716
♪ I want to feel what love is

167
00:05:40,505 --> 00:05:42,955
♪ when the morning comes

168
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:48,072
The next morning, Simon arrived
to pick me up in his new car.

169
00:05:48,312 --> 00:05:50,513
New to him, old and ugly to us.

170
00:05:50,515 --> 00:05:51,880
It's not that bad.

171
00:05:51,882 --> 00:05:53,265
It's...jazzy.

172
00:05:53,267 --> 00:05:56,235
It's better on the inside, except
then people see you're in it.

173
00:05:56,237 --> 00:05:58,104
The color is a
little unfortunate.

174
00:05:58,106 --> 00:06:00,773
What is it, a kind of gold?

175
00:06:00,775 --> 00:06:02,057
It's called Muppet yellow.

176
00:06:02,059 --> 00:06:04,326
Well, I'm sure it
gets great mileage.

177
00:06:04,328 --> 00:06:04,994
Let's go.

178
00:06:04,996 --> 00:06:06,996
Triscareatops awaits.

179
00:06:06,998 --> 00:06:11,450
Are you sure a rollercoaster
won't be too scary for you?

180
00:06:11,452 --> 00:06:12,118
I'll be fine, mom.

181
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,420
At least let me put a
safety tattoo on your arm.

182
00:06:14,422 --> 00:06:16,288
Be right back.

183
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:16,956
Go.

184
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:18,257
Go now before she comes back.

185
00:06:20,344 --> 00:06:23,412
Hold on.

186
00:06:23,414 --> 00:06:28,134
♪ No, I won't stop staring ♪

187
00:06:28,136 --> 00:06:30,519
♪ and I can't stop ♪

188
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:35,307
♪ from watching ♪ no, I
won't stop staring ♪

189
00:06:35,309 --> 00:06:36,692
Oh, my God.

190
00:06:36,694 --> 00:06:38,093
Oh, my God.

191
00:06:38,095 --> 00:06:40,429
Oh-ho-ho, my God.

192
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:41,564
No way.

193
00:06:41,566 --> 00:06:42,731
Oh, my God.

194
00:06:42,733 --> 00:06:43,566
This is it?

195
00:06:43,568 --> 00:06:44,800
This is your car?

196
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:47,153
What is it?

197
00:06:47,155 --> 00:06:48,237
A Ford Festiva.

198
00:06:48,239 --> 00:06:49,955
More like a Ford celibacy.

199
00:06:49,957 --> 00:06:51,790
Ugh, does this thing have a
motor or do we have to stick

200
00:06:51,792 --> 00:06:52,708
our feet through the bottom?

201
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:54,827
Back in the day, this
thing was awesome.

202
00:06:54,829 --> 00:06:57,613
Back in the day when you decided
never to get laid again?

203
00:06:57,615 --> 00:06:58,430
Just get in.

204
00:06:58,432 --> 00:06:59,114
We're already late.

205
00:06:59,116 --> 00:06:59,882
Shotgun!

206
00:06:59,884 --> 00:07:00,583
What, I'm in the car.

207
00:07:00,585 --> 00:07:01,917
No, your feet are on the ground.

208
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:02,585
You're out of the car.

209
00:07:02,587 --> 00:07:03,252
To let you in.

210
00:07:03,254 --> 00:07:05,471
Mmm, sorry, William,
rules are rules.

211
00:07:07,475 --> 00:07:10,893
♪ Well, I'm ♪

212
00:07:10,895 --> 00:07:18,601
♪ hot blooded ♪ check the
disease ♪ I got a fever of 103

213
00:07:18,603 --> 00:07:19,935
I'd like to see the
shotgun rules.

214
00:07:19,937 --> 00:07:21,353
I'd like to see where
those are posted.

215
00:07:21,355 --> 00:07:22,738
They're in the
library of congress.

216
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:23,405
No, they're not.

217
00:07:23,407 --> 00:07:24,473
Yes, they are.

218
00:07:24,475 --> 00:07:26,825
It was established in 1865

219
00:07:26,827 --> 00:07:30,079
when some dude wanted Lincoln's seat in
the theater, so he blew his head off

220
00:07:30,081 --> 00:07:32,748
with a shotgun.

221
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,283
Oh, check out that
bleep wrangler.

222
00:07:34,285 --> 00:07:35,117
What's the bleep stand for?

223
00:07:35,119 --> 00:07:36,502
[Bleep].

224
00:07:36,504 --> 00:07:37,369
Follow them.

225
00:07:37,371 --> 00:07:38,037
I can't.

226
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:38,820
They're going right.

227
00:07:38,822 --> 00:07:40,422
Yup, and Sunshine
Mountain is straight.

228
00:07:40,424 --> 00:07:41,156
We're already late.

229
00:07:41,158 --> 00:07:42,841
Are you kidding me?

230
00:07:42,843 --> 00:07:44,760
Who cares about some dumb
little theme park when we could

231
00:07:44,762 --> 00:07:45,878
be stuffin' some muffin?

232
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,828
Follow them.

233
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:47,546
Simon, don't.

234
00:07:47,548 --> 00:07:48,380
Okay.

235
00:07:48,382 --> 00:07:52,685
Whoa-ho.

236
00:07:52,687 --> 00:07:54,887
Dude.

237
00:07:56,057 --> 00:07:58,440
Hello.

238
00:07:58,442 --> 00:08:00,442
Oh, yeah.

239
00:08:00,444 --> 00:08:08,444
What are you writing?

240
00:08:08,903 --> 00:08:14,206
Don't--

241
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:14,874
No, no, no.

242
00:08:14,876 --> 00:08:16,208
Jay-- take it down!

243
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:17,859
Take it down!

244
00:08:17,861 --> 00:08:18,744
It won't come down!

245
00:08:18,746 --> 00:08:19,411
Take it down!

246
00:08:19,413 --> 00:08:20,162
Come on!

247
00:08:20,164 --> 00:08:22,047
Just go, okay?

248
00:08:22,049 --> 00:08:22,831
Was she dialing?

249
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,200
It looked like--

250
00:08:25,202 --> 00:08:27,336
You wrote down <i>my</i> number?

251
00:08:27,338 --> 00:08:28,470
What'd you do that for?

252
00:08:28,472 --> 00:08:29,138
Just turn around.

253
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:30,472
Turn around and go to
Sunshine Mountain.

254
00:08:30,474 --> 00:08:31,140
Okay.

255
00:08:31,142 --> 00:08:31,807
Sorry, everybody!

256
00:08:36,264 --> 00:08:38,864
Oh, this is so boring.

257
00:08:44,155 --> 00:08:45,070
Come on, people.

258
00:08:45,072 --> 00:08:46,689
We ain't getting any younger!

259
00:08:46,691 --> 00:08:48,023
Just go around them.

260
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:48,741
We're already late.

261
00:08:51,746 --> 00:08:54,730
God, what's the holdup?

262
00:08:54,732 --> 00:08:56,732
Come on, people!

263
00:08:59,737 --> 00:09:07,737
Oh, no.

264
00:09:07,762 --> 00:09:10,546
What's wrong with
you, you monsters!

265
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:16,802
It had been a long journey, but we
finally arrived at Sunshine Mountain

266
00:09:16,804 --> 00:09:17,519
in one piece.

267
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:18,470
Come on, Simon.

268
00:09:18,472 --> 00:09:19,471
Just park.

269
00:09:19,473 --> 00:09:20,356
I'm trying to.

270
00:09:20,358 --> 00:09:21,307
Oh, there are hot girls.

271
00:09:21,309 --> 00:09:23,192
Dude, there are bikini
chicks getting on that tram.

272
00:09:23,194 --> 00:09:23,859
Park!

273
00:09:23,861 --> 00:09:25,778
I can't--I can't do
this any faster.

274
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,429
You couldn't do this any slower.

275
00:09:27,431 --> 00:09:28,597
Do you have a license?

276
00:09:28,599 --> 00:09:29,598
Are you a licensed driver?

277
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,150
I'm a licensed busherman.

278
00:09:31,152 --> 00:09:34,153
You know, bush?

279
00:09:34,155 --> 00:09:35,571
Can you just park?

280
00:09:35,573 --> 00:09:36,989
Why are you going backwards?

281
00:09:36,991 --> 00:09:38,741
Every other car is forwards.

282
00:09:38,743 --> 00:09:39,941
Come on!

283
00:09:39,943 --> 00:09:40,609
No, Jay, wait.

284
00:09:42,446 --> 00:09:45,113
Unfortunately, Simon's
car wasn't so lucky.

285
00:09:45,115 --> 00:09:47,115
Oops.

286
00:09:47,488 --> 00:09:48,505
What'd you do?

287
00:09:48,745 --> 00:09:50,078
What--what'd you do?

288
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,346
What did <i>you</i> do?

289
00:09:51,348 --> 00:09:52,297
What?

290
00:09:52,299 --> 00:09:53,882
We got to get this fixed.

291
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:54,966
Now?

292
00:09:54,968 --> 00:09:55,767
Yes, now.

293
00:09:55,769 --> 00:09:57,102
We can't just leave
it like this.

294
00:09:57,104 --> 00:09:58,854
It's just a door, Simon.

295
00:09:58,856 --> 00:09:59,521
A door?

296
00:09:59,523 --> 00:10:00,188
Yeah.

297
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:00,856
Just a door.

298
00:10:00,858 --> 00:10:02,357
I'm gonna be driving
Carly around in this.

299
00:10:02,359 --> 00:10:04,426
I prefer she doesn't go flying
out on the first sharp turn.

300
00:10:04,428 --> 00:10:06,261
I'm not sure you're gonna be
driving around Carly in this.

301
00:10:06,263 --> 00:10:08,980
Oh, Neil's sister's boyfriend
works at a body shop.

302
00:10:08,982 --> 00:10:10,315
We'll get it fixed
on the way home.

303
00:10:10,317 --> 00:10:10,982
Problem solved.

304
00:10:10,984 --> 00:10:11,650
There you go.

305
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,652
We go in, get Neil, ride the
triscareatops a few times,

306
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:16,071
let Carly see you're having
the time of your life, come

307
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,239
back, and get the car fixed.

308
00:10:17,241 --> 00:10:18,940
It's a perfect plan.

309
00:10:18,942 --> 00:10:19,991
What about the door?

310
00:10:19,993 --> 00:10:21,076
Somebody might take it.

311
00:10:21,078 --> 00:10:21,743
Not a problem.

312
00:10:21,745 --> 00:10:23,412
I'm sure the park has
somewhere to store it.

313
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:24,796
Yeah, it's a park policy.

314
00:10:24,798 --> 00:10:27,466
Every park has it.

315
00:10:27,468 --> 00:10:30,335
We have stroller rentals and
disabled access on certain rides.

316
00:10:30,337 --> 00:10:32,137
That's not really
what I asked though.

317
00:10:32,139 --> 00:10:36,808
We don't have anywhere
to store car doors.

318
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:39,928
Well, turns out they don't really
have anywhere to store car doors.

319
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:40,929
Knew it.

320
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:42,981
Fine, we're just gonna have to
take turns carrying it then.

321
00:10:42,983 --> 00:10:44,966
I'm not carrying this.

322
00:10:44,968 --> 00:10:46,151
You broke it!

323
00:10:46,153 --> 00:10:47,235
You reversed.

324
00:10:47,237 --> 00:10:49,271
Are you really gonna try
to make this my fault?

325
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:54,693
Are you really gonna not try and
make this my fault... or not?

326
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:56,828
Thought not.

327
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,830
What?

328
00:10:58,832 --> 00:11:06,832
So we went to find Neil with the
unspoken hope that maybe he would turn

329
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:07,822
our luck around.

330
00:11:07,824 --> 00:11:08,656
Oh, there's Neil.

331
00:11:09,293 --> 00:11:10,492
Neil!

332
00:11:10,494 --> 00:11:12,127
Neil.

333
00:11:12,129 --> 00:11:13,428
Neil, Neil!

334
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,664
This wasn't him.

335
00:11:16,666 --> 00:11:17,332
Ow!

336
00:11:17,334 --> 00:11:17,999
What the [bleep]?

337
00:11:18,001 --> 00:11:18,666
Neil.

338
00:11:18,668 --> 00:11:19,684
[Bleep].

339
00:11:19,686 --> 00:11:21,052
What was that about?

340
00:11:21,054 --> 00:11:22,437
That was.

341
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:23,355
Neil?

342
00:11:23,357 --> 00:11:24,189
No way.

343
00:11:24,191 --> 00:11:26,341
Neil isn't that tall.

344
00:11:29,346 --> 00:11:33,815
The parrot feet give me two extra
inches, plus I got this built-in cup.

345
00:11:33,817 --> 00:11:35,150
I'm not gonna ask.

346
00:11:35,152 --> 00:11:37,285
Oh, it's so you don't get
boners around the kids.

347
00:11:37,287 --> 00:11:39,955
It's much worse than I thought.

348
00:11:39,957 --> 00:11:44,910
Did you see Carly anywhere?

349
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:49,331
No, but maybe poncho did.

350
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:51,032
We have to find her.

351
00:11:51,034 --> 00:11:53,135
Bobby probably took her
to the haunted castle.

352
00:11:53,137 --> 00:11:56,505
It's the one ride in the whole park without
a lap bar if you know what I mean.

353
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:58,373
Oh, no.

354
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,041
Uh, oh, dude!

355
00:12:00,043 --> 00:12:00,708
What?

356
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,676
You're naked under there?

357
00:12:01,678 --> 00:12:03,145
That's a little
disturbing, isn't it?

358
00:12:03,147 --> 00:12:04,262
Oh, man.

359
00:12:04,264 --> 00:12:05,931
Those guys swiped
my clothes again.

360
00:12:05,933 --> 00:12:07,816
They're always playing
pranks on me.

361
00:12:07,818 --> 00:12:09,684
Just put anything on, Neil.

362
00:12:09,686 --> 00:12:12,154
I have to go find Carly.

363
00:12:12,156 --> 00:12:13,939
Let's try the
triscareatops first.

364
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,440
Good chance she'll
be on that, huh?

365
00:12:15,442 --> 00:12:16,107
It's possible.

366
00:12:16,109 --> 00:12:18,109
We can definitely get a
pinkie in on the scareatops.

367
00:12:18,111 --> 00:12:18,910
Oh, no.

368
00:12:18,912 --> 00:12:19,661
It's cool.

369
00:12:19,663 --> 00:12:21,663
I'll just find something
in the lost and found.

370
00:12:21,665 --> 00:12:22,564
Oh!

371
00:12:22,566 --> 00:12:24,249

I can't believe

378
00:12:40,133 --> 00:12:41,416
it went unclaimed.

379
00:12:41,418 --> 00:12:42,083
Neither can I.

380
00:12:42,085 --> 00:12:43,051
This shirt is awesome.

381
00:12:43,053 --> 00:12:44,219
It lets my belly breathe.

382
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,438
Doesn't look like the rest of you
is struggling for air either.

383
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,523
You sure your sister's boyfriend
works at a body shop?

384
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:50,392
Yeah, she's really
into blue collar guys.

385
00:12:50,394 --> 00:12:51,926
Must take after your dad.

386
00:12:51,928 --> 00:12:55,230
My dad is as straight as I am.

387
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:57,432
You might want to say that
in a different outfit.

388
00:12:57,434 --> 00:12:58,933
Oh, there's Carly.

389
00:12:58,935 --> 00:13:01,119
♪ She was alone tonight

I can't go up to her
holding a car door.

395
00:13:09,296 --> 00:13:10,879
Maybe you could say you won it?

396
00:13:10,881 --> 00:13:12,631
Maybe you could use it
to hide your erection.

397
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:14,633
Simon, hey!

398
00:13:14,635 --> 00:13:20,088

Hey, what's up, man?

403
00:13:31,652 --> 00:13:32,567
Good to see you again.

404
00:13:32,569 --> 00:13:34,236
Good to see you too.

405
00:13:34,238 --> 00:13:35,770
Is that your car door?

406
00:13:35,772 --> 00:13:36,438
Mine?

407
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,109
Yeah, it detaches like a radio
faceplate but a car door.

408
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:44,996
Isn't it heavy?

409
00:13:44,998 --> 00:13:48,033
Nah.

410
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:50,085
Well, we should be going
to the triscareatops.

411
00:13:50,087 --> 00:13:51,169
It'll be closing soon.

412
00:13:51,171 --> 00:13:54,089
Do you want us to watch
your door for you?

413
00:13:54,091 --> 00:13:54,956
It's cool.

414
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:55,757
You guys have fun.

415
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:57,759
I'm gonna give this girl a little
beat down on the squirt game.

416
00:13:57,761 --> 00:13:59,427
Not if I squirt first.

417
00:14:00,097 --> 00:14:00,929
You're going down.

418
00:14:00,931 --> 00:14:02,631
Oh, yeah.

419
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,717
You're gonna have
some competition.

And Simon took his shot, raising
his monkey high into the air,

Stop.

424
00:14:23,687 --> 00:14:25,370

<i>You guys hear that noise?</i>

437
00:14:59,007 --> 00:15:00,289
<i>That's a magnetic launch.</i>

438
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:01,591
<i>Most coasters use momentum.</i>

439
00:15:01,593 --> 00:15:02,592
<i>Not this one.</i>

<i>I hope it kills me.</i>

442
00:15:05,797 --> 00:15:07,129
<i>So you sprinkled her
with some water.</i>

443
00:15:07,131 --> 00:15:07,997
<i>Big deal.</i>

444
00:15:07,999 --> 00:15:09,432

<i>Oh, man, she's living the life.</i>

448
00:15:15,356 --> 00:15:17,223
<i>I wish they would
fire me from school.</i>

449
00:15:17,892 --> 00:15:19,225
<i>And why are we in the slow line?</i>

450
00:15:19,227 --> 00:15:20,610
<i>We've been standing
here an hour.</i>

451
00:15:20,612 --> 00:15:22,945
<i>This is the line for the
front, and it'll be worth it.</i>

452

<i>Front of this coaster's gonna

<i>How hot was that bra though?</i>

458
00:15:30,855 --> 00:15:33,355
<i>That's the kind you can undo
in the front with your teeth.</i>

459

<i>Are you serious?</i>

460
00:15:34,191 --> 00:15:34,957
<i>Those exist?</i>

<i>I watched Jay chew his way through

00:15:41,049 --> 00:15:42,698
<i>Who cares about a coaster, will?</i>

467
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:44,867
<i>We were supposed to be
coming here for me.</i>

<i>What?</i>

475
00:15:57,432 --> 00:15:58,114
<i>One more at the front.</i>

476
00:15:58,116 --> 00:15:59,432
<i>How is there room for just one?</i>

477
00:15:59,434 --> 00:16:00,266
<i>We were at the head of the line.</i>

478
00:16:00,268 --> 00:16:03,102
<i>Well, there are three people at
the front now so that leaves</i>

479

<i>one more seat open, but there
are plenty more further back.</i>

480

<i>I'm sorry.</i>

481
00:16:06,357 --> 00:16:07,523
<i>Can we just rewind a bit?</i>

482
00:16:07,525 --> 00:16:09,224
<i>Why is there room for just one?</i>

483
00:16:09,226 --> 00:16:11,410
<i>Sir, if you could just get on the ride...
I'll tell you why:</i>

484
00:16:11,412 --> 00:16:12,695
<i>Because they cut.</i>

485
00:16:12,697 --> 00:16:14,747
<i>We have been waiting in line
for over an hour, and you just</i>

486

<i>No, it does matter!</i>

494
00:16:21,673 --> 00:16:23,205
<i>What, are they stupid?</i>

495
00:16:23,207 --> 00:16:27,376
<i>Are they such idiots they think
that line cutting is okay, Jeff?</i>

496
00:16:27,378 --> 00:16:28,911
<i>Sir, if you could
please just get on.</i>

497
00:16:28,913 --> 00:16:30,713
<i>Yeah, let's just get on.</i>

498
00:16:30,715 --> 00:16:32,631
<i>All right, fine, just fine.</i>

499
00:16:32,633 --> 00:16:34,633
<i>I'm gonna sit in the front

00:17:00,828 --> 00:17:03,212
<i>Dude, check this out.</i>

506
00:17:06,134 --> 00:17:08,450
<i>You had to buy that.</i>

507
00:17:08,452 --> 00:17:10,970
<i>If it makes you feel better, a
ball popped out of my shorts</i>

508
00:17:10,972 --> 00:17:13,005
<i>and was flopping
around the whole ride.</i>

509
00:17:13,007 --> 00:17:15,057
<i>It's still out.</i>

510
00:17:15,059 --> 00:17:16,008
<i>Oh.</i>

511
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,009
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

512
00:17:17,011 --> 00:17:19,512
<i>I shouldn't have used you to
get to the triscareatops.</i>

<i>I wasn't being a
very good friend.</i>

00:17:21,983 --> 00:17:23,799
<i>How was I not being a

516
00:17:23,801 --> 00:17:24,633
<i>I don't know.</i>

00:17:24,635 --> 00:17:26,268
<i>I just feel left out sometimes.</i>

518

<i>It's okay.</i>

519
00:17:27,822 --> 00:17:30,406
<i>Picture kind of makes up for

00:17:31,526 --> 00:17:33,308
<i>So where to next?</i>

522
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:33,976
<i>We're leaving.</i>

523
00:17:33,978 --> 00:17:35,644
<i>I have to get this
door put back on.</i>

524

<i>Does your sister's
boyfriend work late?</i>

525
00:17:37,165 --> 00:17:38,748
<i>Yeah, but he'll never
be able to fix that.</i>

526
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,415
<i>What?</i>

527
00:17:39,417 --> 00:17:40,983
<i>You said he works
at a body shop.</i>

528
00:17:40,985 --> 00:17:42,818
<i>Yeah, but they just do paint.</i>

529
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:44,620
<i>Well, how does that
help me, Neil?</i>

530
00:17:44,622 --> 00:17:45,454
<i>It's already painted.</i>

531
00:17:45,456 --> 00:17:47,339
<i>They do pin-striping too.</i>

532
00:17:47,341 --> 00:17:48,174
<i>Son of a--God!</i>

533
00:17:48,176 --> 00:17:50,876
<i>And with that our afternoon at
an amusement park had ended...</i>

534
00:17:50,878 --> 00:17:51,544
<i>God!</i>

535
00:17:51,546 --> 00:17:55,330
<i>Without a single second of
amusement, and we couldn't even get</i>

00:17:55,332 --> 00:17:56,215
<i>the leaving part right.</i>

537
00:17:56,217 --> 00:17:57,683
<i>Where did we park?</i>

538
00:17:57,685 --> 00:17:59,018
<i>Shotgun!</i>

539
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:00,836
<i>What--you can't call it yet.</i>

540
00:18:00,838 --> 00:18:01,971
<i>We haven't even found the car.</i>

541
00:18:01,973 --> 00:18:02,888
<i>I don't have to.</i>

542
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,106
<i>We're in the parking lot.</i>

543
00:18:04,108 --> 00:18:05,191
<i>Rules are rules.</i>

544
00:18:05,193 --> 00:18:06,192
<i>What rules?</i>

545
00:18:06,194 --> 00:18:08,227
<i>Would you guys just try
to help me find my car?</i>

546
00:18:08,229 --> 00:18:11,647
<i>What color is it?</i>

547
00:18:11,649 --> 00:18:15,401
<i>Muppet yellow.</i>

548
00:18:16,487 --> 00:18:17,703
<i>My dad's gonna freak.</i>

549
00:18:17,705 --> 00:18:19,989
<i>I'm never getting another car.</i>

550
00:18:19,991 --> 00:18:21,207
<i>Look, we'll find a mechanic.</i>

551
00:18:21,209 --> 00:18:22,491
<i>He's gonna fix it
up as good as new.</i>

552
00:18:22,493 --> 00:18:26,028
<i>There's absolutely no reason
that we can't-- oh, dear God.</i>

553
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,532
<i>No, no, no, no, no!</i>

554
00:18:31,669 --> 00:18:34,837
<i>Oh, oh, who?</i>

555
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:36,005
<i>Why?</i>

556
00:18:36,007 --> 00:18:37,173
<i>Who would do this?</i>

557
00:18:37,175 --> 00:18:37,840
<i>Why?</i>

558
00:18:46,050 --> 00:18:47,566
<i>Good one, you guys.</i>

559
00:18:47,568 --> 00:18:48,818
<i>Had that one coming.</i>

560
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,935
<i>They didn't do it to you.</i>

561
00:18:49,937 --> 00:18:51,053
<i>This is my car.</i>

562
00:18:51,055 --> 00:18:53,022
<i>Simon, they're
intellectually disabled.</i>

563
00:18:53,024 --> 00:18:54,240
<i>Let them have this.</i>

564
00:18:54,242 --> 00:18:55,107
<i>And it's fine, man.</i>

565
00:18:55,109 --> 00:18:56,725
<i>It's just graffiti
and a flat tire.</i>

566
00:18:56,727 --> 00:18:58,727
<i>We can fix this in a hour.</i>

567
00:18:58,729 --> 00:19:05,701
<i>Well, that's gonna make
it more difficult.</i>

568
00:19:05,703 --> 00:19:07,753
<i>It's over.</i>

569
00:19:07,755 --> 00:19:10,372
<i>My life's over.</i>

570
00:19:10,374 --> 00:19:13,242
<i>We don't have a way
to get home now.</i>

571
00:19:13,244 --> 00:19:17,763
<i>Simon?</i>

572
00:19:17,765 --> 00:19:24,303
<i>And our visit to Sunshine Mountain
did help Simon get between</i>

573
00:19:24,305 --> 00:19:25,420
<i>Bobby and Carly.</i>

574
00:19:25,422 --> 00:19:27,223
<i>Thanks again for
the ride, Bobby.</i>

575
00:19:27,225 --> 00:19:27,973
<i>Oh, sure, man.</i>

is a friend of mine.</i>

00:19:31,929 --> 00:19:33,312
