The casino is based entirely on Joker's persona, which angers the Clown Prince Of Crime, and also irritates visiting billionaire Bruce Wayne. Joker escapes Arkham and makes a bee-line to The Joker's Wild casino to blow it up, while Bruce Wayne dons his cape and cowl and discovers Cameron Kaiser's real motive for building it. When Joker arrives he gets duped out in a card game by Bruce Wayne, then dodges Batman via his old Jokermobile before getting to work in earnest to blow up the casino. Batman meanwhile confronts Kaiser, but is knocked out via electric shock and dumped into the Joker's lap. Now tied to a gigantic roulette wheel, Batman recovers enough to warn Joker that Kaiser intends for him to destroy the casino for a massive insurance payment, causing Joker to go after Kaiser while leaving behind enough explosive to finish off Batman.\u2014Michael Daly"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "0519632", "rating": 8.2, "votes": 2104, "number_of_episodes": 85}
