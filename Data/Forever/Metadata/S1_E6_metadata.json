But it doesn't stop there. A second killing resembles another infamous, unsolved crime: the Black Dahlia murder. Henry has seen it all before, as flashbacks show his involvement with the two original cases from two very different periods of his long life. However, Henry's anonymous caller tips him to search beyond the clues of these classic killings and leads the police squad to profile a very different, yet disturbed suspect.\u2014Jiilo_Kim"], "genres": "N/A", "imdbID": "4025942", "rating": 8.6, "votes": 1444, "number_of_episodes": 22}
