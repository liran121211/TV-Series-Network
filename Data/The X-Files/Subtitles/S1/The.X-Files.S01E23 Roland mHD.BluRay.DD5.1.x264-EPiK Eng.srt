1
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,596
Here. Let me do it.

2
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,750
Put your number in, then your card.

3
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,956
What's your number, Roland?

4
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,150
Three fifteen.

5
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:04,189
See how easy it is?

6
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,473
- Engine efficiency?
- 94 percent.

7
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,874
We need more!

8
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,515
- How's the back pressure?
- What do you think? Climbing.

9
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,796
Increase the blade inclination.

10
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,556
- I said, increase the blade inclination!
- Inclination is pi over nine!

11
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,796
We've reached maximum velocity.

12
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:29,154
No!

13
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,238
Let it go. It will work!

14
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,352
The engine'll destroy itself!
I won't do that.

15
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:39,633
It's not going to destroy itself.
Come on! We're almost there!

16
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:42,757
- Something's wrong with our equations.
- What happened?

17
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:46,674
- Nothing. Surnow pulled the plug.
- I'm protecting the baby!

18
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:51,032
- And four years of work, Frank.
- Work that's going to add up to zilch.

19
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:55,676
Unless we show some progress,
they're going to pull the plug on us, Ron.

20
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,634
He's right. You should've continued the test.

21
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,030
Someone'll crack Mach 15.
I want it to be us.

22
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:10,518
Lwon'tjeopardise everything because you
two can't wait to see your name in print!

23
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,114
It's the print that gets the money, Ron.

24
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,079
If you want to go down in flames
together, fine. You go ahead.

25
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:19,276
I'm going to do the math.

26
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:25,356
Good night, Dr Keats.

27
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,117
What the hell?!

28
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,593
Roland! Open the door!

29
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,910
Open the door! Roland, I want you
to listen to me very carefully.

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,276
We have to open this door,
Roland. Stop typing!

31
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,839
Roland!

32
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,792
Roland! Open the door!

33
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,154
What are you doing?!

34
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,839
Open the door!

35
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,160
Roland, are you listening?!

36
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,994
Aagh! No!

37
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,468
Aaaagh!

38
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,834
Aagh!

39
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,395
- How was the wedding?
- The part where the groom passed out...

40
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:08,029
- ..or the dog bit the drummer?
- Did you catch the bouquet?

41
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,238
Maybe. Is that what you couldn't
talk to me about over the phone?

42
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,437
The project they say
doesn't exist does exist.

43
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:19,519
- The Icarus Project?
- The next generation in jet engine design...

44
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,831
...capable of doubling speeds
using half the fuel.

45
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,990
At least in theory.

46
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:28,516
And Ronald Surnow was
an aeronautical scientist...

47
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,319
...who worked on it here at the university?

48
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,470
- Yes.
- How close are they?

49
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,350
I'm not sure, but Surnow's the second
scientist to die in the last six months.

50
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,510
OK. But how is this an X-File?

51
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,238
You don't think this is
about UFO technology?

52
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,279
There's something unexplainable,
but not unidentifiable.

53
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,870
- Keats?
- There.

54
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,154
Dr Keats?

55
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:01,110
We're with the FBI.

56
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,156
Agent Mulder. This is Agent Scully.

57
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,879
We understand you discovered Dr Surnow.

58
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,951
What was left of him.

59
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,431
How do you suppose he became
trapped in the wind tunnel?

60
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,590
Someone must have shut him in.

61
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,558
- The door is operated from there.
- By computer?

62
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:21,757
I've already been through this
with the police.

63
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:25,549
Another member of your team
died recently. Isn't that correct?

64
00:07:25,640 --> 00:07:27,710
Yes. Arthur Grable.

65
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,230
He was killed in an automobile
accident in November.

66
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,198
I'm Frank Nollette. I'm also on the project.

67
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,989
- Are you certain it was an accident?
- What are you driving at?

68
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:43,318
Your work seems to be a perfect target
for industrial espionage.

69
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,118
Who wrote this?

70
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,390
Ron was working on it when I left.

71
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:59,235
The handwriting here doesn't seem
to match any of the other handwriting.

72
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:02,118
It isn't mine.

73
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:07,670
What about Roland Fuller?

74
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:11,036
Uh... Roland's the, uh... janitor.

75
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,033
According to the police report,
he was the only other person here.

76
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,157
- Roland didn't do that.
- How do you know?

77
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,915
Let's just say Roland isn't
exactly a rocket scientist.

78
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,988
Here.

79
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,956
Tracy.

80
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,514
With stars.

81
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,593
Roland?

82
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:50,075
There are some people here
would like to talk with you.

83
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,957
Uh-oh.

84
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,032
I went off the paper.

85
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,989
- Sorry.
- That's all right, Roland.

86
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,638
Tracy.

87
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,518
Would you like to come
help me in the TV room?

88
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,113
OK.

89
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,040
Hi, Roland. Mind if we sit down?

90
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:12,871
Thanks.

91
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,918
Do you mind if we ask you
a couple of questions?

92
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,599
- Do you remember working last night?
- Uh-huh.

93
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,310
Do you remember seeing anything unusual?
Seeing any strangers?

94
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,238
Did, um...

95
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,595
Did Dr Surnow or Dr Keats...

96
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,148
...or Dr Nollette do anything unusual?

97
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,679
Nope.

98
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:45,790
You must like stars.

99
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,549
One hundred and forty-seven.

100
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,597
- Sorry?
- Smm.

101
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,310
You like numbers too, huh?

102
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,070
Roland, let me help you.

103
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,310
One... two...

104
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,072
...three...

105
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,277
...four... five...

106
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,830
...six...

107
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,151
- ..seven...
- Roland, is everything OK?

108
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,708
Roland, are you all right?

109
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,233
Eleven...

110
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,198
- Twelve... thirteen...
- What happened?

111
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,434
What did you say to upset him so?!

112
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,520
Sixteen...

113
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,238
Seventeen...

114
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:54,111
It's definitely the work of a fourth individual.

115
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:59,638
The doctors' cursive standards don't
match what you found on the white board.

116
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,399
Will you do me a favour and try this?

117
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,998
- What is it?
- Something Roland was doodling.

118
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,790
- You don't really think Roland...
- He was the only other person in the lab.

119
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,158
But we're talking about a sophisticated
fluid dynamics equation.

120
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,356
Roland barely has an IQ of 70.

121
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,510
You saw his facility with math.

122
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,717
Don't some autistic individuals
display unusual abilities?

123
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,475
Yes, but even savants behave
only as human calculators.

124
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,074
They can perform certain functions...

125
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,199
...but they can't tell you the value
of anything or the meaning.

126
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,919
I hate to take sides,
but the bottom line is no.

127
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,118
The terminal stroke on the six,
the roof on the five...

128
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,275
I'm sorry. He didn't write it.

129
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,557
Aagh!

130
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:11,354
An organic object exposed to liquid nitrogen
at minus 320 degrees will freeze...

131
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:14,238
...exhibiting great tensile strength...

132
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:18,108
...but is vulnerable to stress
from compression or impact.

133
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:21,158
I've seen this demonstrated on a fish before.

134
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,391
I don't think they'll do this
on Beakman's World.

135
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:28,796
Has this been dusted?

136
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:30,950
- Treat yourself.
- Thanks.

137
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,996
Hey, Scully! Look at these files.

138
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,396
KMAN must be Keats.

139
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,677
This file was turned off at 12.31 last night.

140
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,236
But look. Someone else entered a file
under the name ARTHUR after 12.31.

141
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:55,788
And worked on it for nearly five hours.

142
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:58,195
Well, it couldn't have been Keats.

143
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:02,558
Judging from the rigor of the body,
he was dead around 12.30.

144
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:05,074
So someone came in, killed Keats...

145
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,550
...and then just did some work
on an old Dr Grable file?

146
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:16,755
I can't access the ARTHUR file.
We'll need the password.

147
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:21,317
Try... 15626.

148
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,390
How did you know that that...?

149
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:39,395
This is Arthur Grable's work on the same
equations the others were working on.

150
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,948
Look at all those entries.

151
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:46,871
Someone has been continuing
his work since he died.

152
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,718
How did you know what the password was?

153
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:02,434
Wave goodbye! Wave goodbye!

154
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,470
Wave goodbye! Bye-bye!

155
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,319
Wave goodbye!

156
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,918
Roland?

157
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,594
Why did you sleep in your clothes?

158
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,994
Well, let's get you dressed.
You have visitors.

159
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,594
I'm not supposed to talk to them.

160
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:44,910
Who told you that?

161
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,070
Remember that talk we had...

162
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,276
...about being shy?

163
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:54,910
These are nice people, Roland.

164
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,872
Hey, Roland, you've got more shirts
than I do.

165
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,350
This one would look stylin' today.
What do you think?

166
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:13,510
- The green one.
- The green one?

167
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,192
Please.

168
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,549
Mrs Stodie, can I talk to you a second?

169
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,990
See you later, Roland.

170
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,350
This one?

171
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,550
There you go.

172
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,429
- Do you like your job at the college, Roland?
- Yes.

173
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,590
I hear you're very good at it.

174
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:39,469
Do you remember how you got your job?

175
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,116
A man talked to Mrs Stodie.

176
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,111
What man?

177
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,190
Dr Grable.

178
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,430
Was Dr Grable nice to you?

179
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,829
Yes.

180
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,876
When did you last speak to him?

181
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,834
Last week? The day before?

182
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,030
Dr Grable died.

183
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,834
I'm sorry.

184
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,950
People die.

185
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,156
They go away.

186
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,434
And they're not supposed to come back.

187
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,194
Has Roland ever mentioned
the name Arthur?

188
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,273
That was Dr Grable's first name,
but we only called him Dr Grable.

189
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,352
I doubt Roland even knew
his first name was Arthur.

190
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:41,195
Mrs Stodie, can I get a copy
of Roland's file and past history?

191
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:46,559
- Our patients' histories are confidential.
- I understand, but I can obtain them.

192
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,997
The less time we spend in court,
the more time we have to help Roland.

193
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,554
Roland Fuller was hired by Arthur Grable.

194
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,110
He specifically wanted
a mentally challenged person.

195
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,199
Are you suggesting Arthur Grable
hired Roland in order to use him?

196
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,359
Are you suggesting
Arthur Grable is not dead?

197
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,228
If he had intentions of killing
Nollette, Keats and Surnow...

198
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,790
...why not set it up to appear
the least likely suspect?

199
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:15,718
But, by the look of this, he's hamburger.

200
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,910
Maybe he staged it.

201
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,836
That would explain why his work is
continuing on, six months after his... death.

202
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:28,994
This obituary says Arthur Grable was born
in Seattle. His father was a big banker.

203
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,958
His mother was active
in a number of charities.

204
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,600
Only child. Summa cum laude in physics.

205
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:39,435
Doctoral and postdoctoral in
aeronautical engineering at Harvey Mudd.

206
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:42,557
Brilliant future tragically cut short.

207
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,230
Roland's also from Seattle.

208
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:48,869
He spent most of his life
at the Heritage Halfway House.

209
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,833
The identity of his parents
has been sealed.

210
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:56,949
There's very little information before
the age of three, when he went to the home.

211
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,110
Does it say when he was born?

212
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,150
July 15, 1952.

213
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,635
That's also Arthur's birth date.

214
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:25,510
Don't you wish you could fly?

215
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,230
I can.

216
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,996
When I dream.

217
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:36,156
People can do anything
in a dream, you know.

218
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,150
Once...

219
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,835
One time I had a dream we were married...

220
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,790
...and lived in a house.

221
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,112
Do you have dreams, Roland?

222
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,670
You can tell me.

223
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,277
Roland?

224
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,230
Who's Arthur?

225
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,917
Aagh!

226
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,193
I'm sorry, Roland!

227
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,999
I'm sorry!

228
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,430
Roland!

229
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,919
Roland!

230
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:40,070
Go away!

231
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,310
Roland!

232
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,470
Go away!

233
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,950
I don't want to hurt you!

234
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,310
Go away!

235
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,710
Go away.

236
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,110
- Is that you?
- Yes.

237
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,679
Cool do!

238
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,910
What's the story here?

239
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,230
Um...

240
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:20,269
A quantum physics professor of mine
at Harvey Mudd, uh... flunked me.

241
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,676
He challenged a tenet of one of my theories.

242
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:26,115
A theory I later published in Nature.

243
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:28,754
Anyway, uh... to get back at him...

244
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,594
One afternoon
we decided to take his car apart...

245
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:36,468
...and put it back together again
in his office, and left it running.

246
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:40,235
- Mmm. An egghead classic.
- It was Arthur Grable's idea.

247
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:44,029
- Is that Arthur Grable sitting on the chair?
- Yeah.

248
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:47,635
- Was he a practical joker?
- Atop of all his brilliance...

249
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,274
...he had a genius for elaborate schemes.

250
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:54,956
Could he be making it seem like a man
with a 70 IQ is gaining access to...

251
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:57,838
...and, uh... operating his old computer files?

252
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,475
Arthur would still have to be alive.

253
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,950
- Could he have faked his own death?
- No.

254
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:09,794
The police report on the auto accident
was woefully incomplete.

255
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:12,678
A dry road surface.
No mechanical problems.

256
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:17,788
The body was never admitted to
a county morgue and there was no funeral.

257
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:20,440
If you are trying...

258
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:25,833
...to suggest that Arthur Grable killed
Surnow and Keats, and is after me next...

259
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,990
...you're way off.

260
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,080
Art could not have done the murders.

261
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,879
How can you be so certain?

262
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,750
This is Arthur Grable.

263
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:43,515
Because of massive damage to
his body caused by the accident...

264
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,830
...we could only preserve the head.

265
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,957
Wouldn't your client find it inconvenient...

266
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,875
...to be thawed out in the future, only
to discover he had no functional mobility?

267
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,714
By the time science figures
a way to revive our clients...

268
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,276
- You'll also know how to clone new bodies.
- Exactly!

269
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:07,037
This technology is progressing faster than
anyone thought possible. Ask anyone here.

270
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,796
While for us the passing of each second
brings our bodies closer to death...

271
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:15,031
...for our clients it brings them closer to life.

272
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:20,998
These fluctuations - do they happen often?

273
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:24,311
We've had some problems
with Dr Grable's capsule.

274
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,477
Our technicians checked it
and found nothing.

275
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,835
Is it possible the brain is causing it?

276
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:31,717
No.

277
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:34,360
But we are looking for the explanation.

278
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,639
The patient remains preserved as long as
there's liquid nitrogen in the capsule.

279
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,678
May we take a look at
Arthur Grable's records?

280
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,670
Thank you.

281
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:56,877
Dr Barrington,
as to future medical science...

282
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,350
...what requirements will exist
to be an organ donor?

283
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:05,468
Same as today - compatible genetic
make-up. It's best if the donor's related.

284
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:09,679
Mulder.

285
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:16,194
Arthur Grable put down only one donor.

286
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:20,869
Roland Fuller and Arthur Grable
have the same birthday.

287
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,390
I think they're twins.

288
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,996
Older or younger?

289
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:30,675
Same age. Just less hairy
and with better eyesight.

290
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:34,992
- Gotcha. And the moustache?
- No, lose the whole beard.

291
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:41,995
Next?

292
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,595
Close-cropped hair,
with a slightly receding widow's peak.

293
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:52,712
Lose the glasses.

294
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,518
- That's Roland.
- Give or take a few pounds.

295
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,356
Tell me about your dreams, Roland.

296
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:18,834
It's all right. I won't tell anybody.

297
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:27,080
You know, I had a dream last night.

298
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,078
I dreamt I was swimming in this pool.

299
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:35,789
And I could see my father undenNater.

300
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,598
But when I dove down,
the water stung my eyes.

301
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,920
And there was another man at the pool...

302
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,116
...watching me.

303
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:48,430
He upset me.

304
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,471
He was asking me questions
I didn't want to answer.

305
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:56,190
I had to leave.

306
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,796
I couldn't find my father.

307
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,712
I can't tell you my dreams.

308
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,074
Why not?

309
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,352
Bad.

310
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,392
Your dreams are bad, Roland.

311
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,473
Not you.

312
00:27:26,560 --> 00:27:28,391
You're a good person.

313
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:35,310
I hit Tracy.

314
00:27:39,320 --> 00:27:42,039
Your dreams make you hit Tracy?

315
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:15,754
You know how to work this toy, Roland?

316
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,550
Here.

317
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:42,073
You see, the way you work that toy...

318
00:28:42,760 --> 00:28:44,990
...is like what's happening to you.

319
00:28:47,280 --> 00:28:49,350
You're the spaceship, Roland.

320
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,510
And your dreams are the controls.

321
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,154
Who...

322
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,430
Who runs the controls?

323
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,914
Have you seen this man recently?

324
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,516
Come on, Arthur. We have to
say bye-bye to Roland.

325
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,754
Bye.

326
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:31,429
Roland...

327
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,431
Roland!

328
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,590
Roland, stop!

329
00:29:36,520 --> 00:29:38,909
Roland!

330
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:44,195
Roland!

331
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,638
Roland!

332
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:51,756
We need to keep Roland under observation.

333
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,234
Roland!

334
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:02,039
- He's trying to get away.
- Roland!

335
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,077
Roland!

336
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,710
Roland!

337
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:11,277
Roland!

338
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:13,590
Roland!

339
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,076
Roland!

340
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:28,912
Nollette's gone. We should arrange
a security guard to find him.

341
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,389
No one's gonna provide anything...

342
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:35,792
...once you explain how Roland Fuller
is capable of these murders.

343
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:38,519
You've got a brother, don't you, Scully?

344
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,478
Yeah. I've got an older one
and a younger one.

345
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:46,839
Have you ever thought about calling one
of them, and then suddenly they call you?

346
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,435
Is this a way for me to lower
my long-distance charges?

347
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:52,750
I believe in psychic connections.

348
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:57,834
Evidence suggests it's stronger between
family members. Especially twin siblings.

349
00:30:57,960 --> 00:31:03,592
OK... Maybe. But in this case, one sibling
has closer ties to a frozen fudgsicle...

350
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:06,274
...than he does to his own brother.

351
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:11,354
Arthur Grable is not dead. He's in a state of
consciousness no human has returned from.

352
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:14,750
What if that state allows one
to develop psychic ability...

353
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:18,594
...that the conscious mind is too
preoccupied to explore or believe in?

354
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:22,639
He could use that to control
his brother to kill the scientists.

355
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:25,871
But why? He's been working
with them for years.

356
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,550
OK. Let's go.

357
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,631
I have to call my brother.

358
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,909
We've got to find Nollette.

359
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:42,039
Let's talk to campus security.

360
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:44,839
- We go this way?
- No, we go left.

361
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:09,916
Well...

362
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,594
...wherever you are, Arthur...

363
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,949
...I'm sure you'll appreciate this.

364
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:15,154
Arthur and Roland Grable...

365
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,593
...born at Puget Presbyterian to
Mr and Mrs Lewis Grable on July 15, 1952.

366
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:23,797
Arthur was four minutes older than Roland.

367
00:34:23,880 --> 00:34:26,678
Identical twins.

368
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:31,993
Which means that they're the result of
a single egg fertilised by a single sperm.

369
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:35,794
Studies suggest that in some cases...

370
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:39,668
...the identical twin arises early
in the embryonic stage.

371
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,638
A mutation in one cell is rejected
by other cells as foreign.

372
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:46,474
Roland's condition is the result
of a damaged chromosome

373
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:47,993
rejected by Arthur's cells?

374
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:52,358
In a way that would explain Arthur's genius
and Roland's mathematical gift.

375
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,510
In a way.

376
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:57,989
Agent Scully.

377
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:01,436
This is Larry Barrington
at the Avalon Foundation.

378
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,988
- We've got a situation here.
- Uh-huh.

379
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,998
Last night we had a break-in at the facility.

380
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,150
That's right.

381
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:13,756
It's Arthur Grable's storage unit.
His thermostat's been compromised.

382
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:17,316
- Was there any tissue damage?
- We're trying to assess that now.

383
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:22,838
The temperature's still rising. Something's
blocking our access to the cooling program.

384
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:27,071
Someone tampered with
Arthur Grable's capsule.

385
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,355
They're attempting to stabilise it.

386
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:33,036
Nollette?

387
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,116
What...

388
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,757
What is this?

389
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:03,557
If I have seen further than other men...

390
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,193
...it's because I have stood
on the shoulders of giants.

391
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,550
No...

392
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:17,550
This isn't yours.

393
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:21,034
It's amazing.

394
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:25,750
There's this body, sitting there
in front of me, talking.

395
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,149
But you're controlling it, Arthur.

396
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,556
You...

397
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,200
...took my work!

398
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:38,469
What good was
your work going to do you?

399
00:37:38,640 --> 00:37:42,997
You died before you could finish it,
before you could publish it.

400
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:45,196
It was mine!

401
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:51,599
When I saw the writing on the board,
I knew someone had found the key.

402
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:56,276
Mach 15 was within our reach.
Our futures were guaranteed.

403
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,116
Ironic, isn't it?

404
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,875
You did all the work, and I get all the glory.

405
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,991
No!

406
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,150
Yes.

407
00:38:08,080 --> 00:38:10,150
Yes, Arthur.

408
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,118
I was here,
working on the intake problem...

409
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:16,988
...moments away from a solution,
when you attacked me.

410
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:19,514
Fortunately, I was carrying a gun.

411
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:23,235
After the murder of my colleagues,
who could blame me?

412
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,757
That's... That's interesting.

413
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:31,870
I've got it!

414
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,076
That's it!

415
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:37,232
I've got it!

416
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,833
Arthur!

417
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,516
Arthur! Open the door!

418
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:47,869
Arthur!

419
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,033
Arthur...

420
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,237
...how do you stop this? Tell me how!

421
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,476
- Arthur!
- Hey!

422
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:30,438
Roland, we need you to help us.

423
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,671
Please, we need you
to help us to stop the machine.

424
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:39,073
Try to remember how.

425
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:44,672
Roland, you've got to help him
or he's going to die.

426
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,195
Wave goodbye, Arthur!

427
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:16,152
- Come on, Roland.
- I can't remember!

428
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:25,472
Aagh!

429
00:41:57,160 --> 00:42:00,630
He'll be held in psychiatric
custody for evaluation.

430
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:02,836
Is he being charged with a crime?

431
00:42:02,920 --> 00:42:06,469
The DA hasn't made that determination yet.

432
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:11,680
We've recommended he be remanded to
your custody as soon as the court allows it.

433
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,796
How could this happen?

434
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,031
Roland never exhibited
any violent tendencies.

435
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,228
It's my belief that he wasn't
acting under his own volition.

436
00:42:22,320 --> 00:42:24,390
What do you mean?

437
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,193
This is the work of Arthur, Roland's brother.

438
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:30,477
It's a new theory of
jet propulsion, unfinished.

439
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:34,514
In the last two weeks, Roland
has completed the calculations.

440
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:36,638
How?

441
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:40,395
We're not sure. All we know
is that Roland was somehow...

442
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,438
...able to finish his brother's research.

443
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:04,150
Roland?

444
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,710
Where are you going?

445
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:15,190
Roland, don't go.

446
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:17,590
I have to.

447
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,870
OK. Bye.

448
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,950
Tracy...

449
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:29,070
Wait.

450
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,350
Keep my stars.

451
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,110
I love you.

452
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,550
Me, too.

453
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,430
Sally Lewis

454
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,318
I made this!
