1
00:01:34,221 --> 00:01:37,808
They put the time of death
between eight and twelve hours ago.

2
00:01:37,891 --> 00:01:42,187
No visible cause, no sign of battery
or sexual assault. All we have is this.

3
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:49,111
Can we turn her over?

4
00:01:57,202 --> 00:01:59,288
Karen Swenson.

5
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:03,875
- Is that a positive ID?
- She went to school with my son.

6
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:06,920
Would that be the class of '89?

7
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:11,133
It's happening again, isn't it?

8
00:02:33,238 --> 00:02:35,490
Agent Dana Scully.

9
00:02:57,512 --> 00:02:59,181
Come in.

10
00:03:04,811 --> 00:03:09,691
Agent Scully, thank you for coming
on such short notice. Please.

11
00:03:16,406 --> 00:03:19,993
- You've been with us just over two years.
- Yes, sir.

12
00:03:20,077 --> 00:03:23,747
You went to medical school
but you chose not to practise.

13
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,999
How'd you come to work for the FBI?

14
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:29,294
Well, sir, I was recruited
out of medical school.

15
00:03:29,378 --> 00:03:32,964
Um... my parents still think
it was an act of rebellion.

16
00:03:33,048 --> 00:03:36,968
But I saw the FBI as a place
where I could distinguish myself.

17
00:03:37,052 --> 00:03:40,680
Are you familiar
with an agent named Fox Mulder?

18
00:03:40,764 --> 00:03:42,849
Yes, I am.

19
00:03:42,933 --> 00:03:45,852
- How so?
- By reputation.

20
00:03:45,936 --> 00:03:49,064
Um... he's an Oxford-educated
psychologist...

21
00:03:49,147 --> 00:03:52,859
...who wrote a monograph
on serial killers and the occult...

22
00:03:52,943 --> 00:03:55,654
...that helped to catch Monty Props in 1988.

23
00:03:55,737 --> 00:04:00,867
Generally thought of as the best analyst
in the violent crime section.

24
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:03,495
He had a nickname at the Academy.

25
00:04:04,037 --> 00:04:06,123
<i>Spooky</i> Mulder.

26
00:04:07,082 --> 00:04:10,627
Agent Mulder has developed
a consuming devotion...

27
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:14,631
...to an unassigned project
outside the Bureau mainstream.

28
00:04:14,714 --> 00:04:17,551
Are you familiar with the so-called X-Files?

29
00:04:17,634 --> 00:04:21,388
I believe they have to do
with unexplained phenomena.

30
00:04:21,471 --> 00:04:22,931
More or less.

31
00:04:23,014 --> 00:04:26,977
The reason you're here is we want you
to assist Mulder on these X-Files.

32
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,896
You'll write field reports on your activities...

33
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,858
...and your observations
on the validity of the work.

34
00:04:34,776 --> 00:04:39,865
Am I to understand that you want me
to debunk the X-Files project, sir?

35
00:04:39,948 --> 00:04:43,452
We trust you'll make
the proper scientific analysis.

36
00:04:43,535 --> 00:04:48,123
You'll want to contact Agent Mulder.
We look forward to your reports.

37
00:05:00,552 --> 00:05:04,723
Sorry, nobody down here
but the FBI's Most Unwanted.

38
00:05:19,029 --> 00:05:23,575
Agent Mulder. I'm Dana Scully.
I've been assigned to work with you.

39
00:05:23,658 --> 00:05:27,954
Oh, isn't it nice
to be suddenly so highly regarded!

40
00:05:28,038 --> 00:05:30,540
Who did you tick off to get stuck with this?

41
00:05:30,624 --> 00:05:34,544
Actually, I'm looking forward to working
with you. I've heard a lot about you.

42
00:05:34,628 --> 00:05:39,841
Oh, really? I was under the impression
that you were sent to spy on me.

43
00:05:39,925 --> 00:05:43,887
If you have any doubt
about my qualifications or credentials...

44
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:47,599
You're a medical doctor.
You teach at the Academy.

45
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:50,727
You did your undergraduate degree
in physics.

46
00:05:51,061 --> 00:05:55,273
A New Interpretation. Dana Scully."

47
00:05:55,357 --> 00:05:58,193
That's a credential, rewriting Einstein.

48
00:05:58,276 --> 00:06:01,154
- Did you bother to read it?
- I did. I liked it.

49
00:06:01,238 --> 00:06:05,992
It's just that in most of my work,
the laws of physics rarely seem to apply.

50
00:06:07,994 --> 00:06:10,997
But maybe I can get
your medical opinion on this.

51
00:06:12,874 --> 00:06:17,754
Oregon female, age 21,
no explainable cause of death.

52
00:06:17,837 --> 00:06:20,715
Autopsy shows nothing. Zip.

53
00:06:20,966 --> 00:06:24,803
There are, however, these two
distinct marks on her lower back.

54
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:28,223
Dr Scully, can you ID these marks?

55
00:06:31,726 --> 00:06:34,563
Needle punctures, maybe. An animal bite.

56
00:06:34,646 --> 00:06:36,982
Electrocution of some kind.

57
00:06:37,065 --> 00:06:40,986
How's your chemistry? This substance
was found in the surrounding tissue.

58
00:06:43,363 --> 00:06:45,448
It's organic.

59
00:06:48,368 --> 00:06:51,162
I don't know.
Is it some kind of synthetic protein?

60
00:06:51,246 --> 00:06:53,748
I've never seen it before either.

61
00:06:53,832 --> 00:06:56,376
But here it is again
in Sturgis, South Dakota.

62
00:06:56,459 --> 00:06:59,504
And again in Shamrock, Texas.

63
00:07:00,422 --> 00:07:03,508
- Do you have a theory?
- I have plenty of theories.

64
00:07:03,592 --> 00:07:07,304
Maybe what you could explain to me
is why it's Bureau policy...

65
00:07:07,387 --> 00:07:12,267
...to label these cases as
unexplained phenomena and ignore them.

66
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:16,104
Do you believe in the existence
of extraterrestrials?

67
00:07:16,187 --> 00:07:19,816
Logically, I would have to say no.

68
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:23,403
Given the distances needed
to travel from deep space...

69
00:07:23,486 --> 00:07:26,281
...the energy requirements would exceed...

70
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:27,949
Conventional wisdom.

71
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:31,703
This Oregon female
is the 4th person in her graduating class...

72
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:34,372
...to die under mysterious circumstances.

73
00:07:34,497 --> 00:07:38,001
Now when convention and science
offer us no answers...

74
00:07:38,084 --> 00:07:42,380
...might we not <i>finally</i>
turn to the fantastic as a plausibility?

75
00:07:42,922 --> 00:07:46,760
The girl obviously died of something.
If it was natural causes...

76
00:07:46,843 --> 00:07:49,638
...maybe something was missed
in the postmortem.

77
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:53,767
If she was murdered, it's <i>plausible</i>
there was a sloppy investigation.

78
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:55,894
What I find <i>fantastic...</i>

79
00:07:55,977 --> 00:07:59,356
...is any notion that there are answers
beyond the realm of science.

80
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:03,818
The answers are there.
You just have to know where to look.

81
00:08:03,902 --> 00:08:06,863
That's why they put the "I" in FBI.

82
00:08:07,947 --> 00:08:11,076
See you tomorrow morning, Scully.
Bright and early.

83
00:08:11,159 --> 00:08:14,621
We leave for the very plausible state
of Oregon at 8am.

84
00:08:46,069 --> 00:08:49,698
<i>Would all passengers</i>
<i>fasten their seat belts...</i>

85
00:08:49,781 --> 00:08:51,700
<i>..as we're about to make...</i>

86
00:09:11,344 --> 00:09:13,304
This must be the place.

87
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:36,453
You didn't mention yesterday
this case has already been investigated.

88
00:09:36,536 --> 00:09:39,122
The FBI got involved
after the first three deaths...

89
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:42,125
...when local authorities
failed to turn up any evidence.

90
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:45,754
Our boys came out here,
enjoyed the local salmon...

91
00:09:45,837 --> 00:09:49,382
...which, with a little lemon twist,
is just to die for.

92
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:52,302
Without explanation
they were called back in...

93
00:09:52,385 --> 00:09:56,347
...the case was reclassified and buried
in the X-Files until I dug it up.

94
00:09:56,431 --> 00:09:59,267
- And you found something they didn't?
- Oooh!

95
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:04,063
The autopsy reports of the first
three victims show no unidentified marks.

96
00:10:04,147 --> 00:10:09,736
But those reports were signed by a different
medical examiner than the latest victim.

97
00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:11,738
That's good, Scully.

98
00:10:11,821 --> 00:10:15,366
Better than you expected
or better than you hoped?

99
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,911
I'll let you know
when we get past the easy part.

100
00:10:20,747 --> 00:10:22,916
Is the medical examiner a suspect?

101
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:26,961
We don't know yet. I'm exhuming
one of the other victims' bodies...

102
00:10:27,045 --> 00:10:30,423
...to see if we can get
a tissue sample to match the girl's.

103
00:10:30,507 --> 00:10:34,761
- You're not squeamish, are you?
- I don't know. I've never had the pleasure.

104
00:10:46,606 --> 00:10:48,650
What's going on?

105
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,529
- What the hell was that about?
- Oh, you know. Probably nothing.

106
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:04,684
Mr Mulder,
John Truitt, County Coroner's Office.

107
00:12:04,767 --> 00:12:08,813
Yeah, hi. This is Agent Scully.
How soon can we get started?

108
00:12:08,897 --> 00:12:10,982
- We're ready to go.
- Oh, great!

109
00:12:11,065 --> 00:12:13,902
Were you able to arrange
for an examination facility?

110
00:12:13,985 --> 00:12:18,281
- We got something for ya.
- Excuse me! Excuse me.

111
00:12:18,364 --> 00:12:20,116
No.

112
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:21,326
Please!

113
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:24,871
Please stay in the car!

114
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,544
I just don't know
who you people think you are.

115
00:12:31,628 --> 00:12:35,006
You think you can come up here
and do whatever you please!

116
00:12:35,089 --> 00:12:36,549
I'm sorry. You are...?

117
00:12:36,633 --> 00:12:39,469
I'm Dr Jay Nemman,
County Medical Examiner.

118
00:12:39,552 --> 00:12:42,055
Surely you were told of our intentions?

119
00:12:42,138 --> 00:12:44,265
No. No, we've been away.

120
00:12:44,349 --> 00:12:47,393
Oh! Well, that answers
a question that we had.

121
00:12:47,477 --> 00:12:50,813
Why you hadn't done
the recent autopsy on Karen Swenson.

122
00:12:50,897 --> 00:12:53,900
You're aware of the tissue sample
taken from her?

123
00:12:53,983 --> 00:12:56,110
What is the insinuation here?

124
00:12:56,194 --> 00:12:58,821
That I missed something
in those other kids?

125
00:12:58,905 --> 00:13:02,325
- We're not insinuating anything, sir.
- Wait a minute!

126
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:03,993
See, I think you are!

127
00:13:04,077 --> 00:13:06,579
And you'd better have something
to back it up.

128
00:13:06,663 --> 00:13:10,500
Daddy, please! Let's just go home.

129
00:13:10,583 --> 00:13:12,835
Let's go home! Please!

130
00:13:19,884 --> 00:13:22,720
The guy obviously needed a longer vacation.

131
00:13:23,513 --> 00:13:26,224
Ray Soames was the third victim.

132
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:31,938
He spent time in a state mental hospital,
treated for post-adolescent schizophrenia.

133
00:13:32,021 --> 00:13:34,691
Soames confessed
to the first two murders...

134
00:13:34,774 --> 00:13:38,778
...but couldn't produce any evidence
that he committed the crimes.

135
00:13:38,861 --> 00:13:40,780
Did you read the cause of death?

136
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:45,076
Exposure. His body was found in the woods
after escaping the hospital.

137
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:47,245
Missing for only seven hours in July.

138
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:50,164
How does a 20-year-old boy
die of exposure...

139
00:13:50,248 --> 00:13:53,292
...on a warm, summer night
in Oregon, Dr Scully?

140
00:13:53,376 --> 00:13:55,461
I got it.

141
00:14:15,982 --> 00:14:19,610
- This isn't official procedure.
- Really?

142
00:14:28,077 --> 00:14:33,499
It's probably a safe bet Ray Soames
never made the varsity basketball team.

143
00:14:35,001 --> 00:14:38,629
Seal this up now!
Nobody sees or touches this. Nobody!

144
00:14:46,763 --> 00:14:49,932
This is amazing!
Do you know what this could mean?

145
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:53,061
It's almost too big to comprehend.

146
00:14:53,144 --> 00:14:57,190
The subject is 156cms in length,
weighing 52lbs in extremis.

147
00:14:57,273 --> 00:15:00,735
Corpse is in advanced stages
of decay and desiccation.

148
00:15:00,818 --> 00:15:04,989
Distinguishing features
include large ocular cavities.

149
00:15:05,073 --> 00:15:08,576
Oblique cranium indicates
subject is not human.

150
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:11,954
Could you point that flash
away from me, please?

151
00:15:12,038 --> 00:15:14,707
If it's not human, what is it?

152
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:15,875
It's familian.

153
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:20,880
A chimpanzee or something from
the ape family. Possibly an orang-utan.

154
00:15:20,963 --> 00:15:24,842
Buried in the city cemetery
in Ray Soames's grave.

155
00:15:24,926 --> 00:15:28,346
Try telling that to Ray Soames's family!

156
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:30,473
I want tissue samples, X-rays...

157
00:15:30,556 --> 00:15:33,851
...blood typing, toxicology
and a full genetic work-up.

158
00:15:33,935 --> 00:15:36,270
What we can't do here, we'll order to go.

159
00:15:36,354 --> 00:15:40,441
You don't honestly believe
this is some kind of an extraterrestrial?

160
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:44,278
- This is somebody's sick joke.
- We can do those X-rays here?

161
00:15:44,362 --> 00:15:46,280
Can't we do them right now?

162
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:51,452
I'm not crazy, Scully.

163
00:15:51,994 --> 00:15:53,955
I have the same doubts you do.

164
00:15:55,915 --> 00:15:59,961
<i>Visual inspection</i>
<i>of the body and Χ-ray analysis...</i>

165
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:04,382
<i>..confirms homologous but</i>
<i>possibly mutated mammalian physiology.</i>

166
00:16:04,465 --> 00:16:07,343
<i>However, does not account for...</i>

167
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:11,180
<i>..small unidentified object</i>
<i>found in subject's nasal cavity.</i>

168
00:16:11,264 --> 00:16:13,224
<i>A grey metallic implant...</i>

169
00:16:21,858 --> 00:16:23,401
Who is it?

170
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:25,653
Steven Spielberg!

171
00:16:36,622 --> 00:16:38,791
I'm going for a run. You wanna come?

172
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:39,917
Pass.

173
00:16:40,001 --> 00:16:42,962
You figure out what was up
Ray Soames's nose yet?

174
00:16:43,045 --> 00:16:44,714
No.

175
00:16:44,797 --> 00:16:47,258
And I'm not losing sleep over it. Good night.

176
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:09,071
Ray Soames
was a patient of mine, yes.

177
00:17:09,155 --> 00:17:12,658
I oversaw his treatment for a year
for clinical schizophrenia.

178
00:17:12,742 --> 00:17:14,702
He couldn't grasp reality.

179
00:17:14,785 --> 00:17:18,372
He suffered from some kind
of post-traumatic stress.

180
00:17:18,456 --> 00:17:21,918
- Have you seen it before?
- I've treated similar cases.

181
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:24,629
Were any of those
Ray Soames's classmates?

182
00:17:24,712 --> 00:17:25,755
Yes.

183
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:29,008
We're trying to find a connection
in these deaths.

184
00:17:29,091 --> 00:17:31,802
Did you treat any of these kids
with hypnosis?

185
00:17:31,886 --> 00:17:33,179
No, I did not.

186
00:17:33,262 --> 00:17:36,891
- Are you treating any of these kids now?
- Currently?

187
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:39,852
Yes, I'm treating Billy Miles
and Peggy O'Dell.

188
00:17:39,936 --> 00:17:42,021
Both long-term live-in patients.

189
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:46,525
- They're here at this hospital?
- That's right. Going on four years now.

190
00:17:46,609 --> 00:17:48,236
Can we talk to them?

191
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:51,113
Well, you might find it difficult...

192
00:17:51,197 --> 00:17:54,033
...certainly in Billy Miles' case.

193
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:56,994
Billy's experiencing a waking coma.

194
00:17:57,078 --> 00:18:01,249
His brain waves are flat
and he's persistent vegetative.

195
00:18:01,332 --> 00:18:03,251
How did it happen?

196
00:18:03,334 --> 00:18:06,879
He and Peggy were involved
in an automobile accident on State Road.

197
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:09,006
Peggy?

198
00:18:11,175 --> 00:18:14,303
We have some visitors.
Would you like to talk with them?

199
00:18:14,387 --> 00:18:16,639
Billy wants me to read now.

200
00:18:21,269 --> 00:18:25,314
- Does he like it when you read to him?
- Yes.

201
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:28,401
Billy needs me close.

202
00:18:28,484 --> 00:18:29,527
Doctor?

203
00:18:30,486 --> 00:18:34,865
I'm wondering if we can do
a cursory medical exam on Peggy.

204
00:18:35,783 --> 00:18:38,619
Peggy, what are you doing?

205
00:18:40,997 --> 00:18:43,708
No one is going to hurt you!

206
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:48,170
Get an orderly! Nobody's
going to hurt you. The nurse is here.

207
00:18:50,006 --> 00:18:52,633
It's all right. It's all right.

208
00:18:54,635 --> 00:18:57,179
Peggy, you're going to be fine.

209
00:18:57,263 --> 00:19:00,558
You've had these nosebleeds before.
Now calm down.

210
00:19:05,563 --> 00:19:09,608
Whatshisname... Billy said he was sorry
he didn't get to say goodbye.

211
00:19:09,692 --> 00:19:12,611
How did you know she'd have the marks?

212
00:19:12,695 --> 00:19:14,780
I don't know. Lucky guess?

213
00:19:14,864 --> 00:19:17,241
Dammit, Mulder, cut the crap.

214
00:19:17,325 --> 00:19:20,369
What do you know about those marks?
What are they?

215
00:19:20,453 --> 00:19:24,623
Why? So you can put it in your report?
You're not ready for what I think.

216
00:19:24,707 --> 00:19:27,626
I'm here to solve this case. I want the truth.

217
00:19:27,710 --> 00:19:30,880
The truth?
I think those kids have been abducted.

218
00:19:31,005 --> 00:19:32,631
By who?

219
00:19:32,715 --> 00:19:34,342
By what?

220
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:40,139
- You don't really believe that?
- Do you have a better explanation?

221
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:44,185
I'll buy that girl is suffering
some kind of pronounced psychosis.

222
00:19:44,268 --> 00:19:48,522
Whether it's organic
or the result of those marks, I can't say.

223
00:19:48,606 --> 00:19:52,318
But to say that they've been riding around
in flying saucers is crazy!

224
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:55,863
- There is nothing to support that.
- Nothing <i>scientific.</i>

225
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:59,909
There has got to be an explanation.

226
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:02,536
You've got four victims.

227
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:05,289
All of them died in or near the woods.

228
00:20:05,373 --> 00:20:09,168
They found Karen Swenson's body
in the forest in her pyjamas...

229
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:13,214
...ten miles from her house.
How did she get there?

230
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:16,592
What were those kids doing
out there in the forest?

231
00:21:18,195 --> 00:21:20,281
Mulder?

232
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:53,856
Mulder, is that you?

233
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:59,820
Mulder?

234
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:16,670
Special Agent Dana Scully, FBI.
Drop your weapon.

235
00:22:16,754 --> 00:22:20,174
I'm with the County Sheriff's Department.

236
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:22,343
You're trespassing
on private property here.

237
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:25,221
We are conducting an investigation.

238
00:22:25,304 --> 00:22:27,181
Get in your car and leave!

239
00:22:27,264 --> 00:22:30,476
Or I'll have to arrest you.
I don't care who you are.

240
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:32,478
Hold on! This is a crime scene.

241
00:22:32,561 --> 00:22:34,647
Did you hear what I said?

242
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:38,984
You are on private property
without legal permission.

243
00:22:39,068 --> 00:22:44,281
Now I'm only gonna say it one more time -
get in your car and leave!

244
00:23:24,488 --> 00:23:27,241
What's he doing out here all by himself?

245
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:30,202
Maybe it has something to do with this.

246
00:23:32,371 --> 00:23:34,456
What do you think it is?

247
00:23:37,876 --> 00:23:39,545
I don't know.

248
00:23:39,628 --> 00:23:43,007
- Is it a campfire?
- It was all over the ground.

249
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:48,012
I think something's going on out here.
Some kind of a sacrifice, maybe.

250
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:51,348
What if these kids are involved
in some kind of a cult...

251
00:23:51,432 --> 00:23:53,892
...and that man knows something about it?

252
00:23:53,976 --> 00:23:55,728
I wanna come back here.

253
00:24:05,696 --> 00:24:07,781
You OK, Mulder?

254
00:24:09,700 --> 00:24:12,494
- Yeah, I'm just...
- What are you looking for?

255
00:24:26,133 --> 00:24:28,636
- What happened?
- We lost power.

256
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:31,138
Brakes, steering, everything.

257
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:35,893
We lost nine minutes!

258
00:24:38,187 --> 00:24:40,272
We lost what?

259
00:24:40,356 --> 00:24:42,441
Nine minutes!

260
00:24:42,524 --> 00:24:47,738
I looked at my watch just before the flash,
it was 9:03 - it just turned 9:13.

261
00:24:49,073 --> 00:24:50,449
Look!

262
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:52,618
Look!

263
00:24:53,118 --> 00:24:54,995
Oh, yes!

264
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:56,664
Abductees!

265
00:24:57,706 --> 00:25:01,126
People that have sighted UFOs
reported unexplained time loss.

266
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:04,630
- Come on!
- Gone! Just like that!

267
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:06,465
No, wait a minute.

268
00:25:06,548 --> 00:25:11,345
You're saying that time disappeared?
Time can't just disappear!

269
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:13,931
It's a universal invariance!

270
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:19,812
Not in this zip code.

271
00:25:44,712 --> 00:25:46,088
Great!

272
00:26:19,747 --> 00:26:20,789
Hi!

273
00:26:20,873 --> 00:26:24,418
- I want you to look at something.
- Come on in.

274
00:26:48,776 --> 00:26:49,985
What are they?

275
00:26:52,362 --> 00:26:54,448
Mulder, what are they?

276
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:57,409
Mosquito bites.

277
00:26:57,493 --> 00:27:01,622
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. I got eaten up alive myself out there.

278
00:27:05,793 --> 00:27:07,878
You OK?

279
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:11,548
Yes.

280
00:27:11,632 --> 00:27:14,218
- You're shaking.
- I need to sit down.

281
00:27:17,554 --> 00:27:19,640
Take your time.

282
00:27:27,481 --> 00:27:29,733
I was 12 when it happened.

283
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:32,653
My sister was eight.

284
00:27:32,736 --> 00:27:36,740
She just disappeared
out of her bed one night.

285
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:40,202
Just gone. Vanished.

286
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:43,455
No note. No phone calls.
No evidence of anything.

287
00:27:44,581 --> 00:27:46,667
You never found her?

288
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:50,128
It tore the family apart.
No one would talk about it.

289
00:27:50,212 --> 00:27:54,299
There were no facts to confront.
Nothing to offer any hope.

290
00:27:55,801 --> 00:27:57,845
What did you do?

291
00:27:57,928 --> 00:28:02,933
I went off to school in England.
I came back, got recruited by the Bureau.

292
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:04,977
It seems I had a natural aptitude

293
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:08,605
for applying behavioural models
to criminal cases.

294
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:18,156
My success allowed me a certain freedom
to pursue my own interests.

295
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:21,118
And that's when I came across the X-Files.

296
00:28:21,201 --> 00:28:22,661
By accident?

297
00:28:22,744 --> 00:28:28,166
At first it looked like a garbage dump for
UFO sightings, alien abduction reports...

298
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:30,794
...the kind of stuff most people laugh at.

299
00:28:30,878 --> 00:28:35,424
But I was fascinated. I read
all the cases I could get my hands on.

300
00:28:35,507 --> 00:28:40,596
I read everything about paranormal
phenomena, about the occult and...

301
00:28:42,639 --> 00:28:44,433
What?

302
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:49,605
There's classified government information
I've been trying to access...

303
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:51,940
...but someone has been blocking me.

304
00:28:52,024 --> 00:28:57,154
- Who? I don't understand.
- Someone at a higher level of power.

305
00:28:57,237 --> 00:29:01,742
I'm allowed to continue my work because
I've made connections in Congress.

306
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:05,245
And they're afraid
you'll leak this information?

307
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:08,123
You're part of that agenda. You know that.

308
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:11,251
I'm not a part of any agenda.

309
00:29:12,294 --> 00:29:17,633
You've got to trust me.
I'm here just like you, to solve this.

310
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:25,390
I'm telling you this, Scully,
because you need to know.

311
00:29:25,474 --> 00:29:27,684
Because of what you've seen.

312
00:29:28,727 --> 00:29:32,981
In my research I've worked very closely
with a man named Dr Heitz Werber.

313
00:29:33,065 --> 00:29:36,193
He's taken me through
deep-regression hypnosis.

314
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:38,946
I've been able to go into
my own repressed memories

315
00:29:39,029 --> 00:29:41,490
to the night my sister disappeared.

316
00:29:41,573 --> 00:29:46,286
I can recall a bright light outside
and a presence in the room.

317
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,413
I was paralysed...

318
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:52,668
...unable to respond
to my sister's calls for help.

319
00:29:53,335 --> 00:29:56,380
Listen to me, Scully! This thing exists.

320
00:29:56,463 --> 00:29:59,883
- But how do you know...
- The government knows about it.

321
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:04,888
And I gotta know what they're protecting.
Nothing else matters to me.

322
00:30:04,972 --> 00:30:07,724
And this is as close as I've ever gotten to it.

323
00:30:15,732 --> 00:30:17,609
Hello?

324
00:30:17,693 --> 00:30:18,944
What?!

325
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:20,821
Who is this?

326
00:30:20,904 --> 00:30:22,990
Who is th...

327
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:32,624
That was some woman
who just said Peggy O'Dell was dead.

328
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,544
The girl in the wheelchair?

329
00:30:52,978 --> 00:30:55,939
- What happened?
- She ran out in front of me.

330
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:58,108
- Who are you?
- She was <i>running?</i>

331
00:30:58,191 --> 00:31:00,068
On foot?

332
00:31:20,714 --> 00:31:23,842
- That's just... Let's go!
- We need to ask a few questions.

333
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:26,678
Someone trashed the lab
and they stole the body.

334
00:31:26,762 --> 00:31:30,724
- We're going back to the motel.
- What? They stole the corpse?

335
00:31:36,063 --> 00:31:38,148
FBI.

336
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:42,360
There goes my computer!

337
00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:44,863
Dammit!

338
00:31:44,946 --> 00:31:46,865
The X-rays and pictures!

339
00:32:01,338 --> 00:32:03,548
My name is Teresa Nemman.

340
00:32:04,674 --> 00:32:06,551
You've got to protect me!

341
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:10,555
Come with us.

342
00:32:10,639 --> 00:32:13,433
This is the way it happens.

343
00:32:13,517 --> 00:32:16,686
I don't know how I get out there.

344
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:19,731
I'll just find myself out in the woods.

345
00:32:19,815 --> 00:32:24,277
- How long has it been happening?
- Ever since the summer we graduated.

346
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:28,698
It's happened to my friends, too.
That's why I need you to protect me.

347
00:32:28,782 --> 00:32:33,370
I'm scared I might... die, like the others.

348
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:36,623
Like... Peggy did tonight.

349
00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:40,794
Your father's the medical examiner.
You were the one on the phone.

350
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:43,797
You told me Peggy O'Dell had been killed.

351
00:32:47,551 --> 00:32:50,887
Teresa, your father knows about this,
doesn't he?

352
00:32:50,971 --> 00:32:53,390
About what happens?

353
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:59,479
Yes. But he said
never to tell anyone about any of it.

354
00:32:59,563 --> 00:33:02,774
- Why?
- He wants to protect me.

355
00:33:02,858 --> 00:33:07,404
He thinks he can protect me.
But I don't think he can.

356
00:33:07,487 --> 00:33:10,198
Do you have the marks, Teresa?

357
00:33:12,617 --> 00:33:14,703
Yes.

358
00:33:16,621 --> 00:33:19,541
I'm going to die, aren't I? I'm gonna be next!

359
00:33:19,624 --> 00:33:22,419
No, you're not going to die.

360
00:33:24,671 --> 00:33:26,339
Oh, God!

361
00:33:29,551 --> 00:33:31,636
Let's go home, Teresa.

362
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:35,473
Teresa, come on. Come on, honey.

363
00:33:35,557 --> 00:33:39,644
- I don't think she wants to leave.
- I don't care what you think!

364
00:33:39,728 --> 00:33:40,979
She's sick.

365
00:33:41,062 --> 00:33:44,274
Your father wants to take you home.
He'll clean you up.

366
00:33:44,357 --> 00:33:46,568
I'll take you where you'll be safe.

367
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:50,405
Detective Miles and I
won't let anything happen to you.

368
00:33:50,488 --> 00:33:52,574
You're Billy Miles's father?

369
00:33:52,657 --> 00:33:57,120
That's right.
And you stay away from that boy.

370
00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:05,462
Ah, you gotta love this place.
Every day is like Halloween.

371
00:34:05,545 --> 00:34:09,549
They know, Mulder. They know
who's responsible for the murders.

372
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:11,509
They know <i>something.</i>

373
00:34:11,593 --> 00:34:15,013
Dr Nemman's been hiding
medical evidence from the beginning.

374
00:34:15,096 --> 00:34:18,808
He lied on the autopsy.
And now we find out about the detective.

375
00:34:18,892 --> 00:34:22,145
Who else would have reason
to trash the lab and our rooms?

376
00:34:22,229 --> 00:34:27,025
Why would they destroy evidence?
What would they want with that corpse?

377
00:34:27,108 --> 00:34:29,027
I don't know.

378
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:32,697
Makes you wonder
what's in those other two graves.

379
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:54,928
- They're both empty.
- What is going on here?

380
00:34:56,471 --> 00:35:01,059
I think I know who did it.
I think I know who killed Karen Swenson.

381
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:03,645
Who? The detective?

382
00:35:03,728 --> 00:35:06,231
The detective's son.

383
00:35:07,774 --> 00:35:09,276
Billy Miles.

384
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:12,988
The boy in the hospital? The vegetable?

385
00:35:20,328 --> 00:35:22,038
Billy Miles?

386
00:35:22,747 --> 00:35:27,002
A boy who's been in a coma for four years
came here and dug up these graves?

387
00:35:27,085 --> 00:35:30,714
Peggy O'Dell was in a wheelchair
but she <i>ran</i> in front of a truck.

388
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:34,301
Look, it all fits a profile of alien abduction.

389
00:35:34,384 --> 00:35:36,094
This fits a profile?

390
00:35:36,177 --> 00:35:40,307
Peggy O'Dell was killed around nine.
The same time we lost nine minutes.

391
00:35:40,390 --> 00:35:44,853
Something happened then.
I think that time, as we know it, stopped.

392
00:35:44,936 --> 00:35:47,480
And something took control over it.

393
00:35:49,733 --> 00:35:51,943
You think I'm crazy.

394
00:36:02,746 --> 00:36:04,247
What?

395
00:36:05,915 --> 00:36:09,753
Peggy O'Dell's watch stopped
a couple of minutes after nine.

396
00:36:09,836 --> 00:36:12,088
I made a note of it when I saw the body.

397
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:16,676
That's why the kids come to the forest.
It controls them. It summons them.

398
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,513
And the marks are from some kind of tests
being done on them.

399
00:36:20,597 --> 00:36:24,517
And that maybe causes
some kind of genetic mutation...

400
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:27,020
...which explains the body we dug up.

401
00:36:27,103 --> 00:36:32,233
And the force summoned Teresa Nemman's
body into the woods tonight.

402
00:36:32,317 --> 00:36:35,070
Yes! But Billy Miles took her there.

403
00:36:35,153 --> 00:36:38,573
Summoned by some alien impulse.
That's it!

404
00:36:46,122 --> 00:36:48,083
Come on, let's get out of here.

405
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:51,669
- Where are we going?
- We're gonna visit Billy Miles.

406
00:36:51,753 --> 00:36:54,923
We could be here
until the Second Coming...

407
00:36:55,006 --> 00:36:57,967
...waiting for Billy to get out of this bed.

408
00:36:58,051 --> 00:37:01,721
It ain't gonna happen. He blinks...

409
00:37:01,805 --> 00:37:03,473
...and I know about it.

410
00:37:03,556 --> 00:37:08,478
- I guess you changed his bedpan last night.
- Nobody else here's gonna do it.

411
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:10,647
You noticed nothing unusual?

412
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:15,527
Do you remember what you were doing
last night around nine o'clock?

413
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:19,614
Probably... watching TV. Yeah.

414
00:37:19,697 --> 00:37:22,200
Do you remember what you were watching?

415
00:37:22,283 --> 00:37:24,369
Um, let's see.

416
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:28,039
I don't really remember what I watched.

417
00:37:28,123 --> 00:37:29,332
Miss?

418
00:37:33,294 --> 00:37:35,547
What is she looking for?

419
00:37:37,632 --> 00:37:39,717
Mulder, take a look at this.

420
00:37:49,102 --> 00:37:53,273
- Who took care of Peggy last night?
- Not me. It's not my ward.

421
00:37:53,356 --> 00:37:55,900
Not my aisle of the produce section.

422
00:37:55,984 --> 00:37:59,028
I do have a job of my own to do.

423
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:00,572
What is she doing now?

424
00:38:00,655 --> 00:38:02,365
Thank you for your time.

425
00:38:02,449 --> 00:38:04,409
- OK.
<i>- </i> Good day.

426
00:38:06,578 --> 00:38:09,038
That kid may have killed Peggy O'Dell!

427
00:38:09,122 --> 00:38:11,749
- Scully...
- It's crazy!

428
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:14,752
- He was in the woods!
- You're sure?

429
00:38:14,836 --> 00:38:18,298
This is the same stuff
I took a handful of in the forest.

430
00:38:18,381 --> 00:38:23,303
- We should run a test on it.
- We lost the original sample in the fire.

431
00:38:23,386 --> 00:38:26,598
I want you to understand
what it is you're saying.

432
00:38:26,681 --> 00:38:30,393
- You said it yourself.
<i>- You</i> have to write it in your report.

433
00:38:34,272 --> 00:38:36,357
You're right.

434
00:38:36,441 --> 00:38:39,819
We'll take another sample from the forest

435
00:38:39,903 --> 00:38:42,572
and run a comparison
before we do anything.

436
00:38:48,328 --> 00:38:50,830
The detective's here.

437
00:38:57,795 --> 00:39:00,006
What do you think?

438
00:39:24,447 --> 00:39:26,533
You wouldn't listen to me.

439
00:39:27,408 --> 00:39:29,494
I told you to stay out of this.

440
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:44,008
Hold it! Hold it right there!

441
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:48,388
You got no business out here.

442
00:39:48,471 --> 00:39:51,766
- There were screams.
- Down on the ground.

443
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:52,892
Now!

444
00:39:52,976 --> 00:39:54,602
You know it's Billy.

445
00:39:54,686 --> 00:39:56,938
You've known it all along.

446
00:39:57,021 --> 00:40:01,651
- I said down on the ground.
- How long are you gonna let it happen?

447
00:40:03,444 --> 00:40:05,822
He's gonna kill her!

448
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:16,416
Billy, no! Let her go!

449
00:40:18,251 --> 00:40:20,336
Leave her alone!

450
00:41:20,396 --> 00:41:21,814
Dad?

451
00:41:22,774 --> 00:41:23,816
Billy...

452
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,906
Oh, God!

453
00:41:39,666 --> 00:41:41,084
Scully!

454
00:41:46,464 --> 00:41:49,425
- Scully!
- Mulder, what happened?

455
00:41:49,509 --> 00:41:51,594
There was a light...

456
00:41:51,678 --> 00:41:53,554
It was incredible.

457
00:42:00,978 --> 00:42:03,981
If you can hear me,
raise your right hand.

458
00:42:08,152 --> 00:42:10,238
Tell me about the light, Billy.

459
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,616
When did you first see the light?

460
00:42:14,909 --> 00:42:16,994
In the forest.

461
00:42:18,454 --> 00:42:21,207
We were all in the forest having a party.

462
00:42:22,291 --> 00:42:24,377
All my friends.

463
00:42:25,336 --> 00:42:27,422
We were celebrating.

464
00:42:27,505 --> 00:42:31,259
- What were you celebrating?
- Graduation.

465
00:42:31,342 --> 00:42:33,845
And then the light came.

466
00:42:33,928 --> 00:42:37,348
It took me away... to the testing place.

467
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:42,228
They would tell me to gather the others...

468
00:42:42,311 --> 00:42:44,814
...so that they could do tests.

469
00:42:47,275 --> 00:42:50,403
They put something in my head.

470
00:42:51,446 --> 00:42:53,072
Here.

471
00:42:54,115 --> 00:42:56,200
I would wait for their orders.

472
00:42:58,202 --> 00:43:01,372
Billy, who gave the orders?

473
00:43:02,457 --> 00:43:03,958
The light.

474
00:43:04,041 --> 00:43:06,919
They said it would be OK.
No one would know.

475
00:43:08,129 --> 00:43:12,842
But the tests didn't work.
They wanted everything destroyed.

476
00:43:14,469 --> 00:43:16,554
They said they were leaving.

477
00:43:19,015 --> 00:43:21,100
I'm afraid.

478
00:43:22,477 --> 00:43:24,562
I'm afraid they're coming back.

479
00:43:26,856 --> 00:43:29,901
Don't be afraid, Billy.
We're here to help you.

480
00:43:44,540 --> 00:43:49,170
What we've just witnessed,
what we've read in your field reports...

481
00:43:49,253 --> 00:43:53,800
...the scientific basis and credibility
just seem wholly unsupportable.

482
00:43:53,883 --> 00:43:56,052
- You're aware of that?
- Yes, sir.

483
00:43:56,135 --> 00:43:58,971
My reports are personal and subjective.

484
00:43:59,055 --> 00:44:02,350
I haven't drawn any conclusion
about what I've seen.

485
00:44:02,433 --> 00:44:04,977
Or haven't seen, as seems to be the case.

486
00:44:05,978 --> 00:44:10,983
This... uh... time loss.
You did or did not experience it?

487
00:44:11,067 --> 00:44:13,319
I can't substantiate it. No.

488
00:44:13,402 --> 00:44:16,447
What exactly <i>can</i> you substantiate,
Agent Scully?

489
00:44:16,531 --> 00:44:20,743
I see no evidence that justifies
the legitimacy of these investigations.

490
00:44:21,536 --> 00:44:23,996
There were, of course, crimes committed.

491
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,874
Yes, but how do you prosecute
a case like this?

492
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:29,377
With testimony given under hypnosis...

493
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:33,756
...from a boy who claims
he was given orders from an alien force...

494
00:44:33,840 --> 00:44:36,884
...through an implant in his nose.

495
00:44:38,594 --> 00:44:40,680
You have no physical evidence.

496
00:44:43,766 --> 00:44:48,479
This is the object described by Billy Miles
as a communication device.

497
00:44:48,563 --> 00:44:52,316
I removed it from the exhumed body.

498
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:57,405
I kept it in my pocket. It was the only piece
of evidence not destroyed in the fire.

499
00:44:57,488 --> 00:45:03,870
I ran a lab test on it.
The material could not be identified.

500
00:45:07,081 --> 00:45:11,002
Agent Mulder. What are his thoughts?

501
00:45:12,295 --> 00:45:16,090
Agent Mulder believes we are not alone.

502
00:45:18,175 --> 00:45:20,928
Thank you, Agent Scully. That'll be all.

503
00:46:00,301 --> 00:46:01,802
Hello?

504
00:46:01,886 --> 00:46:05,890
<i>Scully, it's me.</i>
<i>I haven't been able to sleep.</i>

505
00:46:05,973 --> 00:46:09,518
<i>I talked to the DA's office</i>
<i>in Raymon County, Oregon.</i>

506
00:46:09,602 --> 00:46:12,104
<i>There's no case file on Billy Miles.</i>

507
00:46:12,188 --> 00:46:14,482
<i>The paperwork we filed is gone.</i>

508
00:46:15,232 --> 00:46:17,318
