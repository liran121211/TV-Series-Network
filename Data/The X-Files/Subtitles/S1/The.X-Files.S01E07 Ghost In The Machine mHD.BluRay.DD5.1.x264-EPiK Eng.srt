1
00:00:05,674 --> 00:00:10,596
Look, Ben, this is what infuriates me.
Don't you see? It's so painfully obvious.

2
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:13,098
Why do you think our stock's in the toilet?

3
00:00:13,182 --> 00:00:15,934
Because you're cutting research in half.

4
00:00:16,018 --> 00:00:18,604
You've forgotten what the
adventure's about.

5
00:00:18,687 --> 00:00:21,982
The industry's changing.
We need to make some hard choices.

6
00:00:22,065 --> 00:00:26,695
- Save your sound bite for the press!
- Let's not relive the stockholders' meeting.

7
00:00:26,778 --> 00:00:30,199
You're killing me!
You're killing my company!

8
00:00:30,282 --> 00:00:34,161
Eurisko is not your company, Brad.
Not any more.

9
00:00:34,244 --> 00:00:36,997
And you damn well better grow up
and get used to it!

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:39,416
You're gonna regret this.

11
00:00:47,174 --> 00:00:49,051
<i>New paragraph.</i>

12
00:00:49,134 --> 00:00:51,845
<i>As I'm sure everyone</i>
<i>on the board will agree...</i>

13
00:00:51,929 --> 00:00:57,267
<i>..Eurisko has to face head-on the realities</i>
<i>of an increasingly competitive world.</i>

14
00:00:58,435 --> 00:01:01,813
<i>Since the unfortunate departure</i>
<i>of Brad Wilczek...</i>

15
00:01:01,897 --> 00:01:04,775
<i>..I have made recommendations</i>
<i>that I believe</i>

16
00:01:04,858 --> 00:01:08,028
<i>will reposition Eurisko</i>
<i>as an industry leader.</i>

17
00:01:08,612 --> 00:01:14,243
<i>At the top of this list is the immediate</i>
<i>termination of the COS project.</i>

18
00:01:14,952 --> 00:01:18,538
<i>Its disastrous performance</i>
<i>over the past three quarters</i>

19
00:01:18,622 --> 00:01:22,209
<i>and projected losses well into 1994...</i>

20
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:25,295
<i>..leave us no other choice.</i>

21
00:01:37,557 --> 00:01:39,309
Hm.

22
00:01:44,564 --> 00:01:46,650
Ah...

23
00:01:58,996 --> 00:02:01,081
Hello? Hello!

24
00:02:01,164 --> 00:02:04,334
- At <i>the tone, Eastern Standard Time...</i>

25
00:02:04,418 --> 00:02:06,086
<i>.. will be 7.35pm.</i>

26
00:02:06,169 --> 00:02:08,255
What the hell...?

27
00:02:17,014 --> 00:02:18,890
Damn.

28
00:02:27,524 --> 00:02:29,318
Argh!

29
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:48,128
<i>File deleted.</i>

30
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:03,036
Mulder.

31
00:04:03,745 --> 00:04:05,622
Jerry?

32
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:12,295
You're Dana Scully, right? Jerry Lamana.

33
00:04:12,379 --> 00:04:16,925
- We worked together in Violent Crimes.
- "Worked together"! We were partners.

34
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:19,678
That's $8.50, please.

35
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:23,932
- Jerry, what are you doing here?
- Looking for you. And I'm buying you lunch.

36
00:04:24,015 --> 00:04:26,852
- No, really.
- Look, it's on me.

37
00:04:27,936 --> 00:04:29,604
Here.

38
00:04:30,063 --> 00:04:34,025
- Cause of death was electrocution.
- And it wasn't accidental?

39
00:04:34,109 --> 00:04:38,738
Looks like some kind of elaborate booby
trap, but we don't know a whole lot more.

40
00:04:38,822 --> 00:04:41,032
Engineer just found him 12 hours ago.

41
00:04:41,116 --> 00:04:45,078
- Who's running the investigation?
- Either of you know Nancy Spiller?

42
00:04:45,162 --> 00:04:47,789
The forensics instructor at the Academy!

43
00:04:48,582 --> 00:04:51,835
- We used to call her the Iron Maiden.
- On a good day!

44
00:04:51,918 --> 00:04:54,629
Anyway,
she's putting together the squad and...

45
00:04:54,713 --> 00:04:57,340
...I took the liberty of mentioning your name.

46
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:04,389
Look, Jerry, I'd like to help you out,
but we're not on general assignment.

47
00:05:04,931 --> 00:05:07,017
Because of the X-Files?

48
00:05:09,561 --> 00:05:14,983
Look, the truth is I could use a little help on
this. I don't wanna drop the ball on this one.

49
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:17,194
You won't drop the ball.

50
00:05:17,277 --> 00:05:20,906
Drake wasn't just the CEO
of a Fortune 500 company.

51
00:05:20,989 --> 00:05:23,783
He was a good friend
of the Attorney General's.

52
00:05:23,867 --> 00:05:28,205
Another feather in my cap would be nice
cos the one I got is looking mangy.

53
00:05:28,288 --> 00:05:30,790
- Yeah, but, Jerry...
- Look...

54
00:05:30,957 --> 00:05:33,877
...I wouldn't ask if it wasn't important.

55
00:05:35,587 --> 00:05:39,883
- How come you went your separate ways?
- I'm a pain in the ass to work with.

56
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:42,886
- Seriously, Mulder.
- I'm not a pain in the ass?

57
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:45,305
We had different career goals.

58
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:47,474
Jerry wanted the fifth floor.

59
00:05:47,557 --> 00:05:50,519
- And you?
- I was gunning for a basement office...

60
00:05:50,602 --> 00:05:52,479
...with no heat or windows.

61
00:05:52,562 --> 00:05:55,690
Well, I know where you ended up.
What about Jerry?

62
00:05:55,774 --> 00:05:59,319
He ran into a little bad luck in Atlanta
working Hate Crimes.

63
00:05:59,402 --> 00:06:02,906
- What kind of bad luck?
- He misplaced a piece of evidence.

64
00:06:02,989 --> 00:06:05,075
Sent it to the cleaners.

65
00:06:05,158 --> 00:06:09,037
By the time he got it back, a federal judge
had lost both hands and an eye.

66
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:18,547
<i>- </i> 29?
- Uh-huh.

67
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:23,635
<i>- Going up.</i>
- Must be for the visually impaired.

68
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:26,596
How about that?
A politically correct elevator.

69
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,765
<i>Third floor.</i>

70
00:06:28,848 --> 00:06:31,351
<i>Fourth floor.</i>

71
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:34,771
- You OK?
- Yeah.

72
00:06:35,188 --> 00:06:37,274
What was that?

73
00:06:44,739 --> 00:06:46,616
<i>- Yes?</i>
- Hello?

74
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:49,786
<i>- Security. Who's this?</i>
- This is Agent Dana Scully.

75
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:52,914
<i>- Do you have a problem?</i>
<i>- Fifth floor. Sixth floor.</i>

76
00:06:52,998 --> 00:06:55,917
Uh, actually, I think everything's OK.

77
00:06:56,001 --> 00:06:59,629
<i>Ninth floor. Tenth floor. Eleventh floor.</i>

78
00:07:09,806 --> 00:07:12,684
See here?
Someone has tampered with the servo.

79
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:15,312
They switched the ground to the negative...

80
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:19,274
- ..so when he put the key in the lock...
- He completed the circuit.

81
00:07:19,357 --> 00:07:23,111
It's fused.
It takes a lot of juice to melt a steel key.

82
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:26,323
And to throw a 180-pound man ten feet.

83
00:07:26,948 --> 00:07:30,368
The servo switch -
could it have been moved manually?

84
00:07:30,452 --> 00:07:33,455
We didn't find any prints
in the surrounding area.

85
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:38,627
Sure. It could have been switched manually,
but whoever did it had to override the COS.

86
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:41,338
- What's the COS?
- The Central Operating System.

87
00:07:41,421 --> 00:07:43,089
It runs the building.

88
00:07:43,173 --> 00:07:48,178
It regulates everything from energy output
to the volume of water in each toilet flush.

89
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:52,474
This is Claude Peterson, a building
systems engineer. He found the body.

90
00:07:52,557 --> 00:07:55,518
If you wanted to override the COS,
what would they...?

91
00:07:55,602 --> 00:08:00,732
First you'd have to break the access code,
which... well, let's say it wouldn't be easy.

92
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:03,985
We'll need a list
of the people with that know-how.

93
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:07,030
I can tell you right now, it'll be a short list.

94
00:08:07,113 --> 00:08:10,408
- Would you be on it?
- Me?!

95
00:08:10,492 --> 00:08:14,412
Hey, look, I'm just a glorified building super.

96
00:08:14,496 --> 00:08:18,375
All I do is monitor the system,
make sure it's functioning properly...

97
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:21,503
...like when I saw the overload
in Mr Drake's office.

98
00:08:21,586 --> 00:08:24,964
What about the phone lines?
Does the COS monitor all calls?

99
00:08:25,048 --> 00:08:29,094
- Yes, it does. Why?
- I'm just wondering.

100
00:08:29,928 --> 00:08:32,013
OK. Look, can I go now?

101
00:08:36,643 --> 00:08:38,895
Why'd you ask him about the phones?

102
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:41,940
Phone's off the hook.

103
00:08:45,068 --> 00:08:46,653
Maybe Drake was talking to somebody

104
00:08:46,736 --> 00:08:50,448
right before he did
his Ben Franklin impersonation.

105
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:53,576
Taught him everything he knows.

106
00:09:01,084 --> 00:09:03,503
Come in.

107
00:09:04,003 --> 00:09:05,672
It's past three.

108
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:08,883
I'm just looking for my profile notes.

109
00:09:08,967 --> 00:09:12,178
Maybe if you cleaned your desk
more than once a year.

110
00:09:12,262 --> 00:09:14,764
They were right here. I'm telling you.

111
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,810
We're late.

112
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:31,114
There are a couple of elements
for us to consider.

113
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:36,369
Both the statistical rarity
of homicidal electrocution...

114
00:09:36,453 --> 00:09:41,458
...and the complexity of the crime
indicate a certain devious premeditation.

115
00:09:42,292 --> 00:09:45,837
After all, there are much simpler ways
of killing someone.

116
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,093
All of which leads me to believe
that our guy was some kind of

117
00:09:52,177 --> 00:09:54,012
sociopathic game player...

118
00:09:54,095 --> 00:09:55,972
...maybe even a recluse...

119
00:09:56,055 --> 00:09:59,309
...since he designed a trap,
not only to avoid detection...

120
00:09:59,392 --> 00:10:02,020
...but to avoid contact with the victim.

121
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,356
Is that your profile?

122
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,358
Forget it. No.

123
00:10:07,442 --> 00:10:10,820
Drake's final phone call
supports this theory.

124
00:10:11,696 --> 00:10:16,242
<i>At the tone,</i>
<i>Eastern Standard Time will be 7.35pm.</i>

125
00:10:16,326 --> 00:10:18,453
Drake's estimated time of death.

126
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:21,748
Why would Drake call for the correct time
just before he died?

127
00:10:21,831 --> 00:10:23,917
It was an incoming call...

128
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,795
...from somewhere
in the Eurisko building itself.

129
00:10:26,878 --> 00:10:30,715
Whoever set the trap wanted
to make sure that Drake took the bait.

130
00:10:32,717 --> 00:10:36,262
- Excellent work, Agent Lamana.
- Thank you.

131
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:46,397
Jerry, what the hell are you doing?

132
00:10:46,481 --> 00:10:49,943
- Hey, don't get all bent out of shape.
- That was my profile.

133
00:10:50,026 --> 00:10:52,445
Look, I didn't think you'd mind.

134
00:10:55,114 --> 00:10:58,284
Anyway, they were just notes.
I filled in the blanks.

135
00:10:58,368 --> 00:11:01,788
Jerry, you went into my office
and you stole my work.

136
00:11:01,871 --> 00:11:06,584
Look, you're on this case cos I asked you
to help me out, and you helped me out.

137
00:11:06,668 --> 00:11:08,753
What is the big deal?

138
00:11:14,217 --> 00:11:18,471
- What did he say?
- He apologised... in his own way.

139
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:24,102
I just got off the phone with Peterson,
the systems engineer.

140
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:26,396
One name! Brad Wilczek?

141
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:28,565
He said it would be a short list.

142
00:11:28,648 --> 00:11:31,317
<i>And</i> it's headline news
how much he despised Drake.

143
00:11:31,401 --> 00:11:35,864
That just seems too obvious. To kill Drake
would be so brazenly egomaniacal.

144
00:11:35,947 --> 00:11:40,326
And fully consistent
with Jerry's excellent behavioural profile.

145
00:11:40,535 --> 00:11:42,579
Fully.

146
00:12:05,184 --> 00:12:10,356
This is what a 220 IQ and a $400-million
severance settlement buys you.

147
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:22,327
Yes?

148
00:12:23,369 --> 00:12:26,581
Brad Wilczek? We're with the FBI.

149
00:12:27,332 --> 00:12:29,417
What took you guys so long?

150
00:12:33,212 --> 00:12:35,632
Would you mind taking off your shoes?

151
00:12:38,092 --> 00:12:41,763
You can divide the computer science
industry into two types of people:

152
00:12:41,846 --> 00:12:43,723
neat and scruffy.

153
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:48,770
- Benjamin Drake fit into the first category?
- Neat people like things neat.

154
00:12:48,853 --> 00:12:52,398
They wear nicely pressed suits
and work on surface phenomena.

155
00:12:52,482 --> 00:12:57,028
Market shares and third-quarter profits.

156
00:12:57,111 --> 00:13:00,156
And you had a different vision
for the company?

157
00:13:00,239 --> 00:13:04,202
I started Eurisko out of my parents' garage.
I was 22 years old.

158
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:07,914
I'd just spent a year
following around The Grateful Dead.

159
00:13:07,997 --> 00:13:10,458
- You know what Eurisko means?
- Mm-mm.

160
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,627
That's from the Greek, isn't it?

161
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:15,296
Um... "I learn things".

162
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,966
Not exactly. It means "I discover things".

163
00:13:18,049 --> 00:13:20,760
But Ben Drake wasn't interested
in discovery.

164
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:24,514
He was a short-sighted,
power-hungry opportunist.

165
00:13:26,307 --> 00:13:29,352
Let me show you something. Smart home.

166
00:13:29,435 --> 00:13:33,064
From this prototype I have access
to every square foot of my house.

167
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:37,902
This place is as safe as Fort Knox and
as energy efficient as your average igloo.

168
00:13:37,986 --> 00:13:40,530
We were two years ahead of Microsoft...

169
00:13:40,613 --> 00:13:44,659
...when Drake, in his infinite wisdom,
killed the programme.

170
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:48,037
Is this system related to the one
in your corporate building?

171
00:13:48,121 --> 00:13:49,622
Variation on a theme.

172
00:13:49,706 --> 00:13:53,459
How many people know the system
well enough to override it?

173
00:13:53,543 --> 00:13:57,714
Finally the bonus question.
Not many is the answer.

174
00:13:58,715 --> 00:14:02,010
Could someone have hacked
into the system?

175
00:14:02,093 --> 00:14:05,263
Not your average phone freak,
that's for sure.

176
00:14:05,346 --> 00:14:06,866
But there's plenty of kooks out there.

177
00:14:06,889 --> 00:14:11,102
Data travellers, electro wizards,
techno anarchists.

178
00:14:11,185 --> 00:14:13,271
Anything's possible.

179
00:14:13,354 --> 00:14:18,192
- Could <i>you</i> have done it?
- Of course. I designed the system.

180
00:14:19,527 --> 00:14:21,946
That's why you guys are here, isn't it?

181
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:24,115
I'm your logical suspect.

182
00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:26,951
You don't seem too worried.

183
00:14:27,035 --> 00:14:29,620
It's a puzzle, Ms Scully.

184
00:14:29,704 --> 00:14:32,874
And scruffy minds like me like puzzles.

185
00:14:32,957 --> 00:14:38,087
We enjoy walking down unpredictable
avenues of thought, turning new corners.

186
00:14:38,171 --> 00:14:42,467
But as a general rule
scruffy minds don't commit murder.

187
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,351
<i>Some see genius</i>
<i>as the ability to connect the unconnected.</i>

188
00:14:52,435 --> 00:14:56,814
<i>To make juxtapositions.</i>
<i>To see relationships where others cannot.</i>

189
00:14:56,898 --> 00:14:59,192
<i>Is Brad Wilczek a genius?</i>

190
00:14:59,317 --> 00:15:01,402
<i>I don't know.</i>

191
00:15:01,486 --> 00:15:03,571
<i>But I do know this for certain.</i>

192
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:06,616
<i>He has a predilection</i>
<i>for elaborate game playing...</i>

193
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:09,035
<i>..and knowledge of the Eurisko building.</i>

194
00:15:09,118 --> 00:15:13,081
<i>And he has a demonstrable motive</i>
<i>for killing Benjamin Drake.</i>

195
00:15:13,623 --> 00:15:15,708
<i>The question remains.</i>

196
00:15:16,334 --> 00:15:19,253
<i>But if he's so clever, how do we nail him?</i>

197
00:15:20,755 --> 00:15:24,342
<i>End of field journal, October 24th 1993.</i>

198
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,146
<i>File opened.</i>

199
00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:28,531
<i>From the outset,</i>
<i>I knew Eurisko would expand effectively...</i>

200
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:33,119
<i>..not by traditional Western structures,</i>
<i>but by employing certain Zen beliefs...</i>

201
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:35,538
<i>..and other Eastern philosophies.</i>

202
00:16:37,498 --> 00:16:39,834
<i>..and other Eastern philosophies.</i>

203
00:16:41,794 --> 00:16:43,880
<i>..Eastern philosophies...</i>

204
00:16:45,256 --> 00:16:47,341
<i>..Eastern...</i>

205
00:16:52,722 --> 00:16:54,807
Would you give me a second?

206
00:16:59,979 --> 00:17:02,398
Look, I'm here with my hat in my hand.

207
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:05,359
I screwed up. I'm sorry.
What more can I say?

208
00:17:05,443 --> 00:17:09,780
All you had to do was ask.
I would have helped you with the profile.

209
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:14,202
- You don't know what it's like.
- What what's like?

210
00:17:14,285 --> 00:17:15,953
You heard about Atlanta?

211
00:17:16,037 --> 00:17:18,206
They got me on six months' probation.

212
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:21,083
I gotta file daily reports
like some cherry-new agent.

213
00:17:21,167 --> 00:17:23,878
That was bad luck.
Could have happened to anybody.

214
00:17:25,046 --> 00:17:27,173
Not to you.

215
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,469
Don't run yourself down.
You're a good agent.

216
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:35,973
- We did some good work together.
- Let's face it, I was tagging along.

217
00:17:36,057 --> 00:17:38,267
- That's not how it was.
- How would you know?

218
00:17:38,351 --> 00:17:41,562
You were too busy dazzling them
up there on the high wire.

219
00:17:41,646 --> 00:17:43,522
Mulder.

220
00:17:43,606 --> 00:17:45,691
Take a look.

221
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:55,701
We borrowed this from
the voice biometrics lab at Georgetown.

222
00:17:55,785 --> 00:18:00,873
It's a computer spectrogram capable of
identifying individual speech patterns.

223
00:18:00,957 --> 00:18:04,794
This is the recording the COS made
of the phone call Drake received

224
00:18:04,877 --> 00:18:06,545
just before he died.

225
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:13,052
<i>At the tone,</i>
<i>Eastern Standard Time will be 7.35pm.</i>

226
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:17,265
This we put together
from a series of lectures

227
00:18:17,348 --> 00:18:20,101
Wilczek gave at the Smithsonian last year.

228
00:18:21,602 --> 00:18:25,940
<i>At the tone,</i>
<i>Eastern Standard Time will be 7.35pm.</i>

229
00:18:26,691 --> 00:18:28,776
Now we'll stack them.

230
00:18:30,987 --> 00:18:35,783
<i>At the tone,</i>
<i>Eastern Standard Time will be 7.35pm.</i>

231
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:41,038
- You saying this is the same person?
- I'm saying both voices are Brad Wilczek's.

232
00:18:41,122 --> 00:18:43,207
He may have disguised his voice,

233
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:46,294
but not the formants unique
to his own speech patterns.

234
00:18:46,377 --> 00:18:49,463
Which means that
he was the one that killed Drake.

235
00:18:49,547 --> 00:18:52,133
He had the motive and the means.

236
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:54,969
And now we have the physical evidence.

237
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:02,977
Judge Benson lives in Washington Heights.
I can get a warrant in less than an hour.

238
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:05,354
Someone must make sure
Wilczek stays put.

239
00:19:05,438 --> 00:19:08,983
- I'll go with you.
- No, I'm gonna bring him in alone.

240
00:19:09,066 --> 00:19:10,735
I need this one, Mulder.

241
00:19:11,861 --> 00:19:13,321
All right.

242
00:19:27,835 --> 00:19:30,338
Come on, come on. Let me in.

243
00:19:46,896 --> 00:19:47,896
Damn!

244
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,645
Mr Wilczek!

245
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:32,942
<i>Going up.</i>

246
00:20:33,025 --> 00:20:35,986
<i>Second floor. Third floor. Fourth...</i>

247
00:20:45,579 --> 00:20:48,374
- Can I help you?
- FBI.

248
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:09,645
<i>Welcome back, Brad.</i>

249
00:21:12,857 --> 00:21:15,734
You're not equipped
with a voice synthesizer.

250
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,698
What is my user level?

251
00:21:20,781 --> 00:21:23,784
<i>That is now at the discretion</i>
<i>of the operating system.</i>

252
00:21:32,835 --> 00:21:34,503
<i>Going up.</i>

253
00:21:34,587 --> 00:21:37,548
<i>Second floor. Third floor. Fourth floor.</i>

254
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:43,721
<i>Fifth floor. Sixth floor.</i>
<i>Seventh floor. Eighth floor. Ninth floor.</i>

255
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:49,268
<i>Tenth floor. Eleventh floor.</i>
<i>Twelfth floor. Fourteenth floor.</i>

256
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:52,730
<i>Fifteenth floor. Sixteenth floor.</i>

257
00:21:52,813 --> 00:21:54,899
What the hell...?

258
00:21:54,982 --> 00:21:56,650
What are you doing?

259
00:21:56,734 --> 00:22:01,113
<i>Sorry. Those commands are not available</i>
<i>at your current user level.</i>

260
00:22:01,197 --> 00:22:02,865
<i>Try again.</i>

261
00:22:03,199 --> 00:22:06,076
<i>Twenty-third floor. Twenty-fourth floor.</i>

262
00:22:07,328 --> 00:22:10,831
- What are you doing?!
<i>- What are you doing?</i>

263
00:22:14,502 --> 00:22:18,589
<i>Twenty-eighth floor. Twenty-ninth floor.</i>

264
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:20,341
<i>Thirtieth floor.</i>

265
00:22:20,424 --> 00:22:25,971
<i>Twenty-ninth. Thirtieth.</i>
<i>Twenty-ninth. Thirtieth...</i>

266
00:22:26,055 --> 00:22:29,808
<i>Twenty-ninth. Thirtieth.</i>
<i>Twenty-ninth. Thirtieth...</i>

267
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:44,949
Oh, man!

268
00:22:47,618 --> 00:22:49,703
<i>Going down.</i>

269
00:22:52,665 --> 00:22:55,793
No! Don't do this!

270
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:05,803
Oh, my God.

271
00:23:12,476 --> 00:23:14,562
<i>Program executed.</i>

272
00:24:04,778 --> 00:24:06,864
I heard about Jerry.

273
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,326
I'm sorry.

274
00:24:12,161 --> 00:24:14,246
I don't think Wilczek did it.

275
00:24:16,248 --> 00:24:18,125
What?

276
00:24:18,626 --> 00:24:20,711
It doesn't make sense.

277
00:24:20,794 --> 00:24:22,880
Why would he go back to Eurisko?

278
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:27,009
To destroy evidence. To cover his tracks.

279
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:30,888
If you were gonna destroy evidence,
would you pose for the cameras?

280
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:45,694
Mulder.

281
00:24:47,196 --> 00:24:49,281
You've been through a lot.

282
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,909
More than I think even you realise.

283
00:24:55,496 --> 00:24:57,915
I think Wilczek is smarter than this.

284
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,925
He just signed a confession.

285
00:25:10,678 --> 00:25:12,763
How much proof do you need?

286
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:39,289
This is a crime scene. You'll have to leave.

287
00:25:39,373 --> 00:25:41,750
Yeah, I know. I ordered the subpoena.

288
00:25:41,834 --> 00:25:45,587
- That subpoena's been obviated.
- What are you talking about?

289
00:25:45,671 --> 00:25:50,926
Unless you've got a Code 5 clearance,
I'm gonna have to ask you to turn back.

290
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,749
- Thanks for coming.
- I'm here against my better judgment.

291
00:26:21,832 --> 00:26:26,587
In the future I must insist that you respect
the terms of our arrangement.

292
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:30,758
Why is Wilczek
under a Code 5 investigation?

293
00:26:30,841 --> 00:26:32,718
Why do the Defence Department want him?

294
00:26:32,801 --> 00:26:37,765
Why do you think they want the most
innovative programmer in this hemisphere?

295
00:26:37,848 --> 00:26:39,892
- Software?
- Yeah.

296
00:26:39,975 --> 00:26:43,604
For years Wilczek has
thumbed his nose at any contract

297
00:26:43,687 --> 00:26:45,647
involving weapons applications.

298
00:26:45,731 --> 00:26:47,775
He's a bleeding heart.

299
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:49,943
What kind of software?

300
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:53,697
How much do you know
about artificial intelligence?

301
00:26:53,781 --> 00:26:56,200
I thought it was only theoretical.

302
00:26:56,283 --> 00:26:58,368
It was... until two years ago.

303
00:26:58,452 --> 00:26:59,536
Remember Helsinki?

304
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:02,664
The first time a chess-playing
computer beat a grandmaster?

305
00:27:02,748 --> 00:27:04,708
That was Wilczek's program.

306
00:27:05,709 --> 00:27:10,088
And the rumour was that he did it
by developing the first adaptive network.

307
00:27:10,172 --> 00:27:12,424
An adaptive network?

308
00:27:12,508 --> 00:27:15,219
It's a learning machine.

309
00:27:15,302 --> 00:27:17,846
A computer that actually thinks.

310
00:27:18,597 --> 00:27:22,643
And it's, uh, become
something of a holy grail...

311
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:26,980
...for some of our more inquisitive
colleagues in the Department of Defence.

312
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:34,947
They make me wear shoes all the time.
What else do you want from me?

313
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:38,200
Why are you willing to spend
the rest of your life in prison

314
00:27:38,283 --> 00:27:39,827
for a crime you didn't commit?

315
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:44,414
- What are you talking about? I'm guilty!
- I know you're innocent!

316
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:49,711
You're protecting the machine.
The Central Operating System at Eurisko.

317
00:27:50,879 --> 00:27:54,007
If I'm protecting anything,
it's not the machine.

318
00:27:55,676 --> 00:27:57,761
Then what?

319
00:28:01,598 --> 00:28:05,936
After the bomb was dropped
on Hiroshima and Nagasaki...

320
00:28:06,728 --> 00:28:09,690
...Robert Oppenheimer spent
the rest of his life regretting

321
00:28:09,773 --> 00:28:12,025
he'd ever glimpsed an atom.

322
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:14,444
Oppenheimer may have
regretted his actions,

323
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:17,155
but he never denied responsibility for them.

324
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:20,200
He loved the work, Mr Mulder.

325
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:25,831
His mistake was in sharing it
with an immoral government.

326
00:28:26,707 --> 00:28:28,792
I won't make the same mistake.

327
00:28:29,501 --> 00:28:32,004
But your machine killed Drake.

328
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,548
And it killed my friend.

329
00:28:37,259 --> 00:28:39,511
I'm sorry about what happened...

330
00:28:39,595 --> 00:28:41,889
...but there's nothing I can do.

331
00:28:41,972 --> 00:28:43,974
And you talk about morality!

332
00:28:44,057 --> 00:28:48,854
You're afraid of the government, but you'll
accept the risk your machine will kill again!

333
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:51,315
Lesser of two evils.

334
00:28:52,816 --> 00:28:54,902
What about a third option?

335
00:28:57,696 --> 00:28:59,990
You created that machine.

336
00:29:00,073 --> 00:29:02,451
Now you tell me how to destroy it.

337
00:29:05,871 --> 00:29:08,707
Wilczek can create a virus
to destroy the system.

338
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:12,753
Mulder, don't you see? Blaming the machine
is an alibi, and a bad one.

339
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:14,963
It's the <i>only</i> thing that makes sense.

340
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:17,758
The COS project was posting
big losses for Eurisko.

341
00:29:17,841 --> 00:29:19,927
Drake was about to end the programme.

342
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:23,055
So the machine killed Drake
out of self-defence?

343
00:29:23,138 --> 00:29:26,767
Self-preservation -
the primary instinct of all sentient beings.

344
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:31,939
Mulder, that level of artificial intelligence
is decades away from being realised.

345
00:29:32,022 --> 00:29:36,234
Then why was our government
trying to usurp Wilczek's research?

346
00:29:37,027 --> 00:29:40,155
I think you're looking for something
that isn't there.

347
00:29:40,238 --> 00:29:43,033
And I think it has
something to do with Jerry.

348
00:29:44,534 --> 00:29:48,914
Maybe it wouldn't be such a bad idea
if you talked to someone.

349
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,835
You're probably right.

350
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:58,632
- Where are you going?
- To talk to someone.

351
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:25,200
How much time do you need?

352
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:53,020
- Hello?

353
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:09,786
Oh, my God.

354
00:31:15,876 --> 00:31:21,298
This is Special Agent Dana Scully,
ID number 2317-616.

355
00:31:21,381 --> 00:31:24,926
I need you to run a quick trace
on a number for me. Yeah.

356
00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:28,513
202-555-6431.

357
00:31:28,597 --> 00:31:32,726
Yeah, that's my number.
Somebody's accessing my computer.

358
00:31:57,918 --> 00:32:00,796
- Mulder!
- Scully, what are you doing here?

359
00:32:00,879 --> 00:32:05,258
Someone or something's been scanning
my computer files, tapping my phones.

360
00:32:05,342 --> 00:32:09,179
I traced the line.
It came from somewhere in there.

361
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:13,183
It's the machine.

362
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:18,146
How can we get in?

363
00:32:21,817 --> 00:32:23,902
Remember the Trojan Horse?

364
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:41,044
Open sesame.

365
00:32:52,514 --> 00:32:53,974
Oh, what the...

366
00:32:54,558 --> 00:32:56,643
- Mulder!

367
00:33:13,577 --> 00:33:15,912
So much for the element of surprise!

368
00:33:17,831 --> 00:33:20,000
What do you say we take the stairs?

369
00:33:32,304 --> 00:33:34,723
28 down, one to go.

370
00:33:39,936 --> 00:33:41,813
Oh, great.

371
00:33:41,897 --> 00:33:43,565
Mulder?

372
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:52,407
Trick or treat?

373
00:34:00,665 --> 00:34:02,334
No!

374
00:34:02,417 --> 00:34:06,504
- What are you doing?
- Don't wanna make the mistake Drake did.

375
00:34:54,386 --> 00:34:56,263
Who you lookin' at?

376
00:35:21,705 --> 00:35:25,458
There should be a way for you
to drop down and open the door.

377
00:36:14,841 --> 00:36:16,718
Come on, Scully.

378
00:36:34,402 --> 00:36:36,279
Scully?

379
00:36:39,949 --> 00:36:42,869
Agent Mulder. What are you doing here?

380
00:37:14,609 --> 00:37:16,694
Ah...

381
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:22,742
Argh!

382
00:37:26,788 --> 00:37:29,082
Ah... Ah!

383
00:37:39,592 --> 00:37:41,761
Ah! Argh!

384
00:37:42,345 --> 00:37:44,431
Aaargh!

385
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:47,142
Uh!

386
00:38:04,659 --> 00:38:09,122
The machine's been acting all crazy.
Power surges, shut-offs.

387
00:38:09,205 --> 00:38:11,291
That's why I'm here so late.

388
00:38:11,708 --> 00:38:14,752
- Where's the B-port?
- Oh, it's right back here.

389
00:38:24,596 --> 00:38:30,059
Are you sure you know what you're doing?
Because if you don't, it's my job on the line.

390
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:37,525
Damn.

391
00:39:16,397 --> 00:39:18,691
<i>System access granted.</i>

392
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,486
<i>Level 7.</i>

393
00:39:21,653 --> 00:39:23,738
Now I can put in the virus.

394
00:39:24,656 --> 00:39:26,741
Not bad, Agent Mulder.

395
00:39:26,824 --> 00:39:31,246
You know, I've been trying
to access the CPU for the past two years.

396
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:34,916
Now, please, take out your gun
and remove the clip.

397
00:39:40,672 --> 00:39:42,549
Careful.

398
00:39:46,803 --> 00:39:48,471
Defence Department?

399
00:39:48,555 --> 00:39:51,516
Let's say our paychecks are signed
by the same person.

400
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,477
Now give me the diskette
and step away from there.

401
00:39:58,314 --> 00:40:02,193
You don't want to test my resolve,
Agent Mulder.

402
00:40:07,574 --> 00:40:09,659
Put down the gun.

403
00:40:12,245 --> 00:40:16,249
- You don't know what you're dealing with.
- Shut up and drop the gun!

404
00:40:21,629 --> 00:40:24,173
You're making a mistake, Agent Scully.

405
00:40:28,428 --> 00:40:30,763
Compromising your sworn duty.

406
00:40:30,847 --> 00:40:34,684
This operation is more sensitive
than you can possibly imagine.

407
00:40:34,767 --> 00:40:38,313
- Don't listen to him.
- The technology in this machine...

408
00:40:38,396 --> 00:40:40,607
...is of enormous scientific interest.

409
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:43,568
It's a monster.
It's killed two people.

410
00:40:43,651 --> 00:40:45,778
They can't handle it any better than Wilczek.

411
00:40:45,862 --> 00:40:47,405
Make no mistake.

412
00:40:47,488 --> 00:40:49,949
<i>You</i> will be held accountable.

413
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:55,246
Mulder, put in the disk.

414
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:01,419
<i>What are you doing, Brad?</i>

415
00:41:01,794 --> 00:41:03,880
<i>Don't do this, Brad.</i>

416
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:09,469
<i>Bad command or file name.</i>
<i>Sector 7 not found home.</i>

417
00:41:41,751 --> 00:41:43,628
<i>Brad...</i>

418
00:41:44,087 --> 00:41:46,172
<i>Brad...</i>

419
00:41:47,173 --> 00:41:49,967
<i>Brad... why?</i>

420
00:42:15,076 --> 00:42:18,788
I checked with the Department
of Corrections subcommittee.

421
00:42:18,871 --> 00:42:23,084
- I even petitioned the Attorney General.
- You won't find him.

422
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:26,796
They can't take a man like Brad Wilczek
without an explanation.

423
00:42:26,879 --> 00:42:30,425
<i>They</i> can do anything they want.

424
00:42:31,384 --> 00:42:33,344
Where is he?

425
00:42:34,178 --> 00:42:37,557
In the middle of what we in the trade call
"hard bargaining".

426
00:42:38,474 --> 00:42:41,519
Wilczek won't deal.
He'll never work for them.

427
00:42:41,602 --> 00:42:46,441
Loss of freedom does funny things to a man,
and Wilczek confessed to two murders.

428
00:42:46,524 --> 00:42:51,279
And <i>you</i> effectively destroyed the only
evidence that could have exonerated him.

429
00:42:52,822 --> 00:42:54,949
What else could I have done?

430
00:42:55,825 --> 00:43:00,663
Nothing, unless you were willing
to let the technology survive.

431
00:43:02,081 --> 00:43:05,293
The Department of Defence
still hasn't found anything?

432
00:43:06,377 --> 00:43:10,423
They've been on it for five days.
Wilczek's virus was thorough.

433
00:43:10,506 --> 00:43:13,968
It left no trace of the artificial intelligence.

434
00:43:15,011 --> 00:43:17,096
The machine is dead.

435
00:43:31,319 --> 00:43:35,156
We pushed the pulse code
modulations to the limit.

436
00:43:35,239 --> 00:43:37,325
Nothing.

437
00:43:40,578 --> 00:43:43,664
We've combed the parsing subroutine.

438
00:43:43,748 --> 00:43:45,833
Yes, sir. Twice.

439
00:43:45,917 --> 00:43:49,170
No, sir. Still nothing, but I'd like to request...

440
00:43:54,342 --> 00:43:55,802
Yes, sir.

441
00:43:55,885 --> 00:43:57,970
No, I understand.

442
00:43:58,054 --> 00:43:59,931
Yes, sir.

443
00:44:00,973 --> 00:44:04,560
Six more hours before we have to consign

444
00:44:04,644 --> 00:44:07,522
the whole damn thing
to the metal shredder.

445
00:44:07,605 --> 00:44:09,774
We'll do what we can, sir.

446
00:44:34,131 --> 00:44:37,677
<i>I'm gonna figure this thing out if it kills me.</i>

447
00:44:41,472 --> 00:44:45,893
Natasha Cohn

448
00:45:13,087 --> 00:45:14,755
<i>I made this!</i>
