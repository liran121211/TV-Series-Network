1
00:00:14,975 --> 00:00:17,060
Hurry and get him outta there!

2
00:00:18,687 --> 00:00:20,939
I need two men on the left side! Now!

3
00:00:22,024 --> 00:00:25,903
- Wait! Where are you going with him?
- He's dead.

4
00:00:25,986 --> 00:00:29,281
There's a woman over there who isn't
and she needs oxygen!

5
00:00:29,364 --> 00:00:34,036
Step back!
Sir, if you'll just cooperate here a little bit.

6
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,547
<i>- </i> I want you to rise!
- Amen.

7
00:00:45,631 --> 00:00:47,466
Rise up and heal!

8
00:00:47,591 --> 00:00:50,427
- What are you doing?
- The boy's laying on hands.

9
00:00:51,637 --> 00:00:53,972
Rise up and accept the miracle he has given.

10
00:00:54,056 --> 00:00:55,140
Amen. Hallelujah.

11
00:00:55,265 --> 00:00:58,227
You don't understand. The man's dead.

12
00:00:58,977 --> 00:01:01,396
Then the boy can't do any harm, can he?

13
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,483
This is the power of belief.

14
00:01:04,608 --> 00:01:07,653
The power to separate
the light from the darkness...

15
00:01:07,778 --> 00:01:10,072
...to create life from death.

16
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:11,490
Amen.

17
00:01:11,615 --> 00:01:13,992
All right, everyone! Show's over!

18
00:01:14,076 --> 00:01:16,161
Let's clear the area!

19
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:33,262
Hallelujah, Samuel.

20
00:01:33,345 --> 00:01:35,013
Hallelujah.

21
00:02:25,147 --> 00:02:27,232
Yes, indeedy! Oh, hallelujah!

22
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:31,695
Hallelujah, brother! Praise God!

23
00:02:32,904 --> 00:02:34,656
Yes, indeedy! Praise God!

24
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,747
- I want everybody to say "Hallelujah!"
- Hallelujah!

25
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:43,498
Praise the Lord!

26
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:49,046
The woman on the table
has a malignant tumour on her spine.

27
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:54,009
This boy here is gonna attempt to heal her
by simply laying his hands on her.

28
00:02:54,092 --> 00:02:57,262
- Where'd you get this?
- From the regional office in Tennessee.

29
00:02:57,512 --> 00:03:00,057
- The preacher is...
- Reverend Calvin Hartley.

30
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:03,727
- You've heard of him?
- The boy is his adopted son, Samuel.

31
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,896
He says he found him as an infant...

32
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:08,899
...lying in the weeds
on the banks of the Mississippi.

33
00:03:08,982 --> 00:03:12,110
He also claims the boy
brought a man back from the dead.

34
00:03:12,194 --> 00:03:14,821
It's more than a claim. The man he saved...

35
00:03:14,946 --> 00:03:19,659
...is an attraction in the reverend's tent
ministry. The boy's performed miracles...

36
00:03:19,785 --> 00:03:22,162
...every week for the past ten years.

37
00:03:22,287 --> 00:03:25,791
- Twice on Sunday.
- Not according to Kenwood's county sheriff.

38
00:03:25,874 --> 00:03:30,379
Local authorities think that
Reverend Hartley and his son are a scam.

39
00:03:30,462 --> 00:03:32,756
They haven't been able to shut him down...

40
00:03:32,839 --> 00:03:35,967
...so they've turned to the FBI
to try and get a prosecution.

41
00:03:36,051 --> 00:03:40,222
- For what? Fraud?
- No. Murder. Watch the tape.

42
00:03:40,305 --> 00:03:41,348
<i>Lucy Kelly...</i>

43
00:03:41,473 --> 00:03:43,517
<i>.. has the cancer.</i>

44
00:03:44,309 --> 00:03:45,977
<i>Her doctors say...</i>

45
00:03:46,061 --> 00:03:48,146
<i>.. it is inoperable.</i>

46
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:50,816
<i>They say it is incurable.</i>

47
00:03:50,899 --> 00:03:53,235
<i>But I say to you...</i>

48
00:03:53,318 --> 00:03:56,113
<i>.. that what the doctors cannot cure...</i>

49
00:03:56,196 --> 00:03:58,281
<i>.. the Lord can.</i>

50
00:03:58,365 --> 00:04:01,535
<i>Yes, indeedy, praise God! Because God...</i>

51
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:05,414
<i>.. can work... miracles.</i>

52
00:04:07,249 --> 00:04:10,377
<i>Today the clear light of God's healing love...</i>

53
00:04:11,753 --> 00:04:13,422
<i>.. is flowing...</i>

54
00:04:13,505 --> 00:04:17,050
<i>.. through Samuel's healing hands.</i>

55
00:04:18,176 --> 00:04:22,639
20 minutes later, Lucy Kelly was rushed
to the hospital. She was dead on arrival.

56
00:04:22,722 --> 00:04:27,185
- What was the cause of death?
- I don't know, but it wasn't cancer.

57
00:04:27,269 --> 00:04:32,107
They've requested someone with a medical
background to assist in the investigation.

58
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,694
- I know this isn't an X-File...
- When do we leave for Tennessee?

59
00:04:46,288 --> 00:04:49,624
I think I saw some of these
same people at Woodstock.

60
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:52,002
Mulder, you weren't at Woodstock.

61
00:04:52,085 --> 00:04:55,380
- I saw the movie.
- There you go.

62
00:05:02,596 --> 00:05:05,765
- Will you be all right by yourself?
- I'll be fine.

63
00:05:05,891 --> 00:05:07,559
I won't be long.

64
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:17,319
Most of you here today
I know as neighbours...

65
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:21,865
...and as cherished members
of our Miracle Ministry.

66
00:05:21,948 --> 00:05:24,701
But some of you have come from far away.

67
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:26,870
As far away as...

68
00:05:26,953 --> 00:05:29,748
...Pensacola, Florida!

69
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:32,042
And Uniondale, Long Island!

70
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:37,005
And this is especially to...

71
00:05:37,088 --> 00:05:39,174
...those of you who come from so far...

72
00:05:39,257 --> 00:05:43,011
...that I must apologise
from the bottom of my heart...

73
00:05:44,429 --> 00:05:48,433
...because, unfortunately,
Samuel cannot be here this afternoon.

74
00:05:48,517 --> 00:05:51,978
<i>- </i> Oh!
- I know how very deeply disappointed...

75
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:54,356
...each of you must be feeling right now.

76
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:57,192
But I say unto you, do not be dismayed...

77
00:05:57,275 --> 00:06:00,487
...do not despair, do not lose your hope!

78
00:06:01,196 --> 00:06:03,281
Because in two short days...

79
00:06:03,365 --> 00:06:07,786
...Samuel will be back here
at our very special Miracle Mission!

80
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:12,999
Yes, indeedy, praise God!

81
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:16,086
We should head backstage
and see what he has to say.

82
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:19,464
No, wait. This is the part
where they bring out Elvis.

83
00:06:19,548 --> 00:06:22,092
As these people will testify...

84
00:06:22,175 --> 00:06:24,803
...Samuel can heal you! Yes.

85
00:06:24,886 --> 00:06:26,972
Samuel <i>will</i> heal you!

86
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:29,391
But...

87
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:33,103
...only if you believe.

88
00:06:33,186 --> 00:06:35,605
I believe, reverend! I believe!

89
00:06:35,689 --> 00:06:38,233
- Fine sermon, reverend.
- God bless you.

90
00:06:38,316 --> 00:06:41,111
Reverend Hartley? We're with the FBI.

91
00:06:41,194 --> 00:06:43,905
I see Sheriff Daniels has sent in the cavalry.

92
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:47,534
- We just want to talk to Samuel, that's all.
- He's not here.

93
00:06:47,659 --> 00:06:50,620
<i>- </i> Well, where is he?
- I don't know.

94
00:06:50,704 --> 00:06:52,455
I haven't seen him.

95
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:57,252
- The boy's been a bit troubled lately.
- We're running late, reverend.

96
00:06:57,335 --> 00:06:59,004
If you'll excuse me.

97
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:21,860
- Agent Mulder?
- Yeah.

98
00:07:21,943 --> 00:07:26,531
- Sheriff Daniels. We spoke on the phone.
- Yeah. This is Special Agent Dana Scully.

99
00:07:26,615 --> 00:07:30,994
- You wanted a copy of the coroner's report.
- Right. Thank you.

100
00:07:31,077 --> 00:07:34,706
I see you folks got a chance
to take in the Holy Roller sideshow.

101
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:37,959
I take it you're not one of
the Reverend Hartley's flock.

102
00:07:38,043 --> 00:07:40,920
No, I remember Hartley
when he was on his soapbox

103
00:07:41,004 --> 00:07:43,757
collecting dollar bills in coffee cans.

104
00:07:43,882 --> 00:07:46,468
Since the boy joined the act,

105
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:49,346
he's got himself a Cadillac
for every day of the week...

106
00:07:49,429 --> 00:07:52,849
...bought for with money
that we need for roads and schools.

107
00:07:52,932 --> 00:07:55,435
People want to believe, you know?

108
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,938
99% of the people in this world are fools.

109
00:07:59,064 --> 00:08:02,067
And the rest of us
are in great danger of contagion.

110
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,235
Even if Hartley and Samuel are fakes,

111
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,405
it's still a long way
from accusing the boy of murder.

112
00:08:07,489 --> 00:08:11,868
I got witnesses that say the boy was laying
hands on those people when they died.

113
00:08:11,951 --> 00:08:15,038
You think that's how he killed them...
with a touch?

114
00:08:15,121 --> 00:08:17,123
I don't know how or why he did it.

115
00:08:17,248 --> 00:08:21,086
But we've been looking for him since
Tuesday and he does not wanna be found.

116
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:23,380
There's nothing unusual
about these reports,

117
00:08:23,463 --> 00:08:25,882
except that no autopsies were performed.

118
00:08:25,965 --> 00:08:29,344
Hartley blocked my autopsy request
on religious grounds.

119
00:08:29,427 --> 00:08:33,598
Also doesn't help that the county coroner
is a member of the Miracle Ministry.

120
00:08:33,682 --> 00:08:37,352
Well, maybe we can arrange
to have the bodies exhumed.

121
00:08:56,454 --> 00:08:58,540
Sheriff...

122
00:09:03,128 --> 00:09:05,213
It's Hartley's group.

123
00:09:05,296 --> 00:09:06,965
Damn.

124
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:11,136
I told my people to keep quiet
so this wouldn't happen.

125
00:09:11,219 --> 00:09:14,597
Looks like you might have
a few believers on the payroll.

126
00:09:14,681 --> 00:09:17,809
On behalf of the Miracle Ministry...

127
00:09:17,892 --> 00:09:20,395
...we demand that you stop this sacrilege!

128
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:24,482
You're not just dealing with me, Vance.
You're dealing with the FBI.

129
00:09:27,861 --> 00:09:30,572
We don't mean you any disrespect.

130
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:33,158
We're investigating a possible homicide...

131
00:09:33,241 --> 00:09:37,120
...and federal law requires
that we do a postmortem on these bodies.

132
00:09:37,203 --> 00:09:41,374
I'm afraid we answer to an even
higher authority than the US Government.

133
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:46,296
One that considers gravedigging
and defiling corpses mortal sins.

134
00:09:46,379 --> 00:09:48,465
We'll get that autopsy.

135
00:09:48,548 --> 00:09:52,260
- Sooner or later, you know we will.
- The deceased's family...

136
00:09:52,343 --> 00:09:54,721
...does not want her grave disturbed.

137
00:09:54,846 --> 00:09:57,390
Carol Wallace had no family!

138
00:09:57,515 --> 00:09:59,517
<i>We</i> were her family.

139
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:04,230
We... were her family.

140
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:07,108
And it was hard enough to bury her once.

141
00:10:07,192 --> 00:10:12,864
So if you insist on going through with this,
we are prepared to maintain a vigil...

142
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:15,241
...and do whatever it takes...

143
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:16,826
...to stop you!

144
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,620
Mulder.

145
00:10:18,703 --> 00:10:20,205
Scully.

146
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:26,878
One of my men just spotted
the boy's car downtown.

147
00:10:28,046 --> 00:10:30,799
- We can't do much here anyway.
- Let's go.

148
00:10:49,108 --> 00:10:52,570
Not a very likely place to be saving souls.

149
00:11:08,086 --> 00:11:11,130
- Where's the boy?
- He's in the can.

150
00:11:11,256 --> 00:11:14,634
<i>- </i> What happened?
- That damn fool started a fight.

151
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:19,138
Figures them Bible-thumpers
wouldn't know how to hold their liquor.

152
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:24,602
Where you been, Samuel?
We've been looking for you.

153
00:11:24,686 --> 00:11:26,229
Yeah?

154
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:27,981
I've been thinking.

155
00:11:28,773 --> 00:11:33,278
Well, you're gonna have plenty of time
for that in my cell. You're under arrest.

156
00:11:34,821 --> 00:11:37,615
- For murder?
- For suspicion of murder.

157
00:11:39,367 --> 00:11:41,369
Mind if I finish my beer first?

158
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:44,372
No, you go right on ahead.

159
00:11:44,455 --> 00:11:46,833
I'll have somebody take your statement.

160
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:50,336
I'll see what I can do about
getting your Caddy towed.

161
00:11:51,462 --> 00:11:55,633
Sheriff? What evidence do you have
to charge the boy with murder?

162
00:11:56,676 --> 00:12:00,054
What more do you want?
He's practically giving himself up.

163
00:12:00,138 --> 00:12:02,223
Look at him, though. He's drunk.

164
00:12:02,307 --> 00:12:06,686
Well, then I'll add drunk and disorderly.
Let's get this straight.

165
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:09,564
It's not a question about the boy's guilt...

166
00:12:09,647 --> 00:12:11,733
...just how he did it.

167
00:12:11,816 --> 00:12:13,860
Let me have a minute with him?

168
00:12:13,985 --> 00:12:16,279
Suit yourself.

169
00:12:16,362 --> 00:12:19,490
Samuel?
I'm Agent Mulder. This is Agent Scully.

170
00:12:20,491 --> 00:12:22,410
From the FBI.

171
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:25,204
Looks like you took quite a beating there.

172
00:12:25,330 --> 00:12:27,582
Penance, Mr Mulder.

173
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:30,418
Some might call it a plain old bar brawl.

174
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:33,004
You know what they say...

175
00:12:33,087 --> 00:12:35,256
"He giveth and he taketh away."

176
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:40,386
A man gets too proud...

177
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:44,390
...sometimes it does him good
to get the crap kicked out of him.

178
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:47,268
- Saves God the trouble.
- The trouble of what?

179
00:12:47,352 --> 00:12:49,729
Humbling the guilty sinner.

180
00:12:49,854 --> 00:12:51,522
Guilty of murder?

181
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:55,818
Yes, sir.

182
00:12:55,902 --> 00:12:57,904
How'd you do it, Samuel?

183
00:12:59,197 --> 00:13:02,992
Apparently, my pride and weakness
were an invitation to the devil.

184
00:13:03,076 --> 00:13:05,370
I muddied the river of my own faith.

185
00:13:06,037 --> 00:13:11,250
- Now my gift has been corrupted.
- So you killed those people with a touch?

186
00:13:11,376 --> 00:13:14,629
I've laid my hands on the ill,
given them health.

187
00:13:15,463 --> 00:13:17,548
I've healed the sick.

188
00:13:17,632 --> 00:13:20,760
I've even touched the dying
and given them life.

189
00:13:22,553 --> 00:13:24,639
God has given me a special gift.

190
00:13:24,722 --> 00:13:27,016
Did he buy you all that jewellery, too?

191
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,103
There's something missing
in your story, Samuel.

192
00:13:30,228 --> 00:13:36,359
- Do you doubt the power of God, ma'am?
- No. But I doubt the veracity of your claims.

193
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:39,696
I have looked on the infirm
and seen their sickness...

194
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:41,447
...their cancer.

195
00:13:44,242 --> 00:13:46,661
Just as I can see the pain on this man...

196
00:13:46,744 --> 00:13:48,913
...right here.

197
00:13:48,997 --> 00:13:51,457
Really? What pain is that?

198
00:13:56,254 --> 00:13:59,841
The pain you have... regarding a brother...

199
00:13:59,966 --> 00:14:04,095
...or a sister. It's an old pain.

200
00:14:05,972 --> 00:14:08,433
- It's never been healed.
- Is this a trick?

201
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,229
No trick, ma'am.

202
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:15,064
I think we should get the sheriff.

203
00:14:15,148 --> 00:14:18,526
I want to hear more about this pain. Tell me.

204
00:14:18,609 --> 00:14:21,738
I can see it, plain as day.

205
00:14:21,821 --> 00:14:25,783
It <i>was</i> a sister. You lost a sister quite young.

206
00:14:27,368 --> 00:14:30,246
- Someone took her away.
- What else do you see?

207
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:33,416
Strangers. A bright light.

208
00:14:33,499 --> 00:14:34,667
Sheriff?

209
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:38,796
You should have come here
earlier. I could have healed your pain.

210
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,382
- Let's get this over with.
- Another minute.

211
00:14:41,466 --> 00:14:43,551
I can't help you. Not any more.

212
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:46,721
- My gift is gone.
- Cuff him.

213
00:14:54,145 --> 00:14:55,813
All right, let's go.

214
00:14:57,648 --> 00:14:59,650
You have the right to remain silent...

215
00:14:59,734 --> 00:15:02,653
I'll tell you, Mr Mulder...

216
00:15:03,738 --> 00:15:07,283
God watches over his flock.
He gives us signs every day.

217
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:09,494
Open your heart.

218
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:13,039
He might just open your eyes.

219
00:15:17,168 --> 00:15:20,088
How do you think he does it?

220
00:15:20,171 --> 00:15:21,839
I don't know.

221
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:33,434
Given his exemplary record
and the circumstantial nature of this case...

222
00:15:33,518 --> 00:15:37,355
...I ask that my client be released
on his own recognisance...

223
00:15:37,438 --> 00:15:38,481
...without bail...

224
00:15:38,564 --> 00:15:40,733
Judge, that is not a good idea!

225
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:44,278
- Samuel!
- Let me go and it'll be on your head!

226
00:15:44,362 --> 00:15:49,367
Enough! This is not a pulpit,
this is a court of law. Is that understood?

227
00:15:52,453 --> 00:15:54,080
Yes, sir.

228
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:56,207
Sorry.

229
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,918
Your Honour...

230
00:15:59,043 --> 00:16:03,548
...despite the defendant's avowed guilt,
we see no reason to burden the county...

231
00:16:03,631 --> 00:16:08,553
...with his maintenance until trial. But
we do request a minimum bail of $100,000.

232
00:16:08,636 --> 00:16:11,639
All right. If there are no objections...

233
00:16:11,722 --> 00:16:13,808
...bail is set at $100,000...

234
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:18,479
...to be deposited directly
into the clerk's probation account.

235
00:16:18,563 --> 00:16:21,774
- Ugh!
- My God! What is it?

236
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:24,986
My God!

237
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:27,155
My God! What is it? What is it?

238
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,419
How much more will it take
for you to believe?

239
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:44,839
The Lord has testified against me!

240
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:49,010
Does a serpent have to bite you
all on the ass till you understand?!

241
00:16:49,093 --> 00:16:51,345
Clear this courtroom!

242
00:17:10,281 --> 00:17:14,327
"And when it was morning,
the east wind brought the locusts...

243
00:17:14,452 --> 00:17:17,830
...and the locusts covered
the face of the whole earth...

244
00:17:17,955 --> 00:17:21,751
...so that the land was darkened,
and they did eat every herb of the land...

245
00:17:21,834 --> 00:17:24,503
- Why, Mulder?
- ..And all the fruit of the trees..."

246
00:17:24,629 --> 00:17:28,382
A few thousand grasshoppers
does not constitute a plague.

247
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:31,802
Besides which, we're in farm country.

248
00:17:31,886 --> 00:17:35,973
This area is an agricultural smorgasbord
for this type of infestation.

249
00:17:36,057 --> 00:17:40,019
Yeah, maybe in a cornfield,
but this happened in a courtroom.

250
00:17:40,144 --> 00:17:42,939
So what's next? Slaying of the first-born?

251
00:17:43,022 --> 00:17:44,774
Ha, ha.

252
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:48,569
Mulder, does this have something
to do with what Samuel said in the bar?

253
00:17:48,653 --> 00:17:50,738
About your sister...?

254
00:17:52,823 --> 00:17:56,494
I had these patient cases sent over
from Kenwood County Hospital.

255
00:17:56,577 --> 00:17:59,372
These are cases of patients

256
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:02,124
who went to Samuel
after conventional treatments failed.

257
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:05,253
"Spontaneous remission
of metastatic cancer."

258
00:18:06,337 --> 00:18:09,423
"Regenerated nerve growth
after paraplegia."

259
00:18:09,507 --> 00:18:13,761
I've encountered dozens of psychic healers
in the X-Files, but none like this.

260
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:17,223
- I think the kid's for real.
- Mulder, this is intriguing...

261
00:18:17,348 --> 00:18:21,477
...but there's a whole library of
medical literature dealing with...

262
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,980
...unexplained spontaneous cures.

263
00:18:24,063 --> 00:18:29,068
Now, Western medicine treats the human
body in biochemical terms, right?

264
00:18:29,193 --> 00:18:30,194
Uh-huh.

265
00:18:30,278 --> 00:18:33,656
But the body can also be treated
as an electromagnetic system.

266
00:18:33,739 --> 00:18:37,493
So you think if Samuel can repair
this energy field in order to heal...

267
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:39,704
...he can also destroy it in order to kill?

268
00:18:39,787 --> 00:18:40,871
Why not?

269
00:18:40,955 --> 00:18:45,376
OK. Say that Samuel's touch <i>can</i> kill.
Why would <i>he</i> want to?

270
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:48,754
Well, you heard him -
he muddied the river of his own faith...

271
00:18:56,304 --> 00:18:58,431
If you're available...

272
00:18:58,556 --> 00:19:00,933
...the reverend would like to see you.

273
00:19:03,936 --> 00:19:06,814
I've been under a lot of stress lately...

274
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:10,234
...which I know doesn't excuse
my rude behaviour yesterday...

275
00:19:10,318 --> 00:19:13,612
...but I hope... somehow you find it
in your hearts to forgive me.

276
00:19:13,738 --> 00:19:15,740
Why did you want to speak with us?

277
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:18,784
I need your help.

278
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:22,204
Samuel's being tried for murder.
What you need is a good lawyer.

279
00:19:22,288 --> 00:19:25,333
- Samuel is innocent.
- How can you be sure of that?

280
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,294
Because he's my son.

281
00:19:28,419 --> 00:19:31,047
I don't think that argument
will work on a jury.

282
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,632
Samuel's confession
won't help much either.

283
00:19:33,758 --> 00:19:38,346
You have to understand.
Samuel is a very complicated young man.

284
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:41,640
He feels things... like no one else.

285
00:19:41,766 --> 00:19:43,392
To him...

286
00:19:43,476 --> 00:19:45,936
...a pinprick becomes a gaping wound.

287
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:49,690
His power... comes from this ability to feel.

288
00:19:49,774 --> 00:19:52,568
But, you see, some people fear that power.

289
00:19:52,651 --> 00:19:56,280
And out of their weakness and their fear,
they seek to destroy it.

290
00:19:56,364 --> 00:19:57,948
You mean Sheriff Daniels.

291
00:19:58,032 --> 00:20:01,619
It's no secret that Sheriff Daniels
has tried to shut me down...

292
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:04,288
...since I first opened the tent ten years ago.

293
00:20:04,372 --> 00:20:07,792
Well, he thinks that your ministry is a fraud.

294
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,002
He's a faithless man, Agent Scully.

295
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:14,298
His wife suffers from
a most painful arthritis...

296
00:20:14,382 --> 00:20:19,929
...her fingers twisted like bitter roots, yet
he keeps Samuel from ministering to her.

297
00:20:20,012 --> 00:20:22,807
In light of recent events,
you can't blame him.

298
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:25,726
I don't know how those poor people died.

299
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:30,940
I can't explain that, which is why
I'm asking you to be there tonight...

300
00:20:31,023 --> 00:20:34,777
...so you could see for yourselves
Samuel doing God's work.

301
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,154
Can I count on you both to be there?

302
00:20:37,238 --> 00:20:40,408
I think so.
Mulder, what do you think?

303
00:20:40,491 --> 00:20:42,660
Excuse me.

304
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:57,174
- Hey, where did she go?
- Who?

305
00:20:57,258 --> 00:21:00,845
- The little girl.
- There's no little girl around here.

306
00:21:12,189 --> 00:21:13,858
Mulder?

307
00:21:15,359 --> 00:21:17,945
- What is it?
- It's a girl.

308
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:20,114
Who, Jessica Hahn?

309
00:21:21,449 --> 00:21:23,534
A little girl.

310
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:33,878
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

311
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:39,091
Well, brothers and sisters, help yourselves.

312
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:43,179
Let the folks with the wheelchairs through.
That's right, don't be shy.

313
00:21:43,262 --> 00:21:46,390
Hello, there.
Welcome to the Miracle Ministry.

314
00:21:46,474 --> 00:21:49,518
- Y'all come to see Samuel tonight?
- Yes.

315
00:21:49,602 --> 00:21:53,689
- Is he going to be here? The papers said...
- Oh, don't mind the papers!

316
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:56,150
God's work will be done.

317
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:59,778
Young Samuel's here
to cast out the devil and heal the sick.

318
00:21:59,904 --> 00:22:02,615
- Did you hear that, honey?
- Will he be able to see me?

319
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:07,036
Well, I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna put in a special word, hm?

320
00:22:07,119 --> 00:22:09,246
- What's your name?
- Margaret Hohman.

321
00:22:09,330 --> 00:22:11,248
Margaret, you wait right here.

322
00:22:11,332 --> 00:22:16,045
I'm gonna see if I can't get somebody
to put you in the front row. How'd that be?

323
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:17,796
Huh?

324
00:22:20,508 --> 00:22:22,593
<i>I can't go out there.</i>

325
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:24,595
Not after what's happened.

326
00:22:25,471 --> 00:22:27,848
God tests the faith in us all, son.

327
00:22:27,932 --> 00:22:30,643
And because he's chosen you
to act in his likeness...

328
00:22:30,768 --> 00:22:33,437
...he's given you the toughest test of all.

329
00:22:34,772 --> 00:22:37,107
Do not forsake your gift, Samuel.

330
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:38,859
Oh, man!

331
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:43,614
I'm a preacher, son. That's my gift.

332
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:50,037
But all the preaching in the world
could never equal even a small miracle...

333
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:53,707
...in consolidating
the faith and hope of these people.

334
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:58,379
Let this man, whose life you saved...

335
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:00,756
...give witness tonight...

336
00:23:00,839 --> 00:23:04,134
...to the grace and goodness
of your healing power.

337
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:08,305
They're all waiting on you, Samuel.

338
00:23:31,412 --> 00:23:33,497
Here we go!

339
00:23:33,581 --> 00:23:36,500
Here he is! Get ready for the Reverend...

340
00:23:36,584 --> 00:23:38,669
...Calvin Hartley!

341
00:23:41,005 --> 00:23:43,090
Yes, indeedy! Praise God!

342
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:45,509
Hallelujah!

343
00:23:45,593 --> 00:23:47,052
Hallelujah!

344
00:23:47,177 --> 00:23:48,512
Praise the Lord!

345
00:23:48,596 --> 00:23:50,014
Praise the Lord!

346
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:51,765
Whoo!

347
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:54,310
- Amen! Tell it, brother!
- I'm ready!

348
00:23:54,393 --> 00:23:56,353
God is here tonight. Oh, yes!

349
00:23:56,437 --> 00:23:58,522
Pass it down, please.

350
00:23:58,606 --> 00:24:01,775
I feel his presence! Oh, amen!

351
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:05,070
- Apparently miracles don't come cheap.
- God is here...

352
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:07,948
...and he is here...

353
00:24:09,033 --> 00:24:10,117
...to heal!

354
00:24:11,952 --> 00:24:13,954
Yes, heal!

355
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:17,082
Hallelujah! There's a man...

356
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:20,002
...I'd like to introduce to you. A man...

357
00:24:20,085 --> 00:24:22,254
...who has seen the face of God...

358
00:24:23,297 --> 00:24:26,800
...but who was not satisfied
to go to that great place. Oh, no.

359
00:24:26,884 --> 00:24:29,928
No, God had work for him
to do right here on earth.

360
00:24:30,054 --> 00:24:32,097
As it is in heaven!

361
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:36,143
I saw this man come back...

362
00:24:36,226 --> 00:24:38,812
- ..from beyond death's door!
- Praise his name!

363
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:41,899
He stands here today
as a living testament...

364
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:45,986
...to the ability of God...

365
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:49,490
...to work miracles. Ladies and gentlemen...

366
00:24:49,573 --> 00:24:51,659
...brothers and sisters...

367
00:24:52,576 --> 00:24:54,828
...our beloved friend...

368
00:24:54,912 --> 00:24:56,580
...Leonard Vance.

369
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:02,127
As it says in John, chapter three...

370
00:25:03,587 --> 00:25:06,757
...no man can do these miracles
unless God be with him.

371
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:10,928
That man to whom I owe my life...

372
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:13,764
...is Samuel Hartley.

373
00:25:14,098 --> 00:25:16,016
And he is here tonight to heal you.

374
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,936
Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen...

375
00:25:19,019 --> 00:25:21,730
...God's soldier - Samuel Hartley.

376
00:25:29,196 --> 00:25:30,280
Mulder?

377
00:25:36,787 --> 00:25:38,288
Receive God's love.

378
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:45,170
Feel the power of God.

379
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:58,142
Pray with me.

380
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:10,154
Close your eyes.

381
00:26:24,168 --> 00:26:27,004
- What have you done?
- OK, everyone, remain calm.

382
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:29,339
Give the young woman room here.

383
00:26:29,423 --> 00:26:30,966
Praise God!

384
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:33,177
Somebody get an ambulance!

385
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,888
It's all right. Don't panic!

386
00:26:47,524 --> 00:26:49,193
She's dead.

387
00:27:14,218 --> 00:27:16,261
Brothers and sisters...

388
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:19,306
...if you desecrate the body...

389
00:27:19,807 --> 00:27:21,975
...then you slay...

390
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:23,727
...the soul!

391
00:27:26,146 --> 00:27:28,899
Let's keep this poor woman's body intact.

392
00:27:31,652 --> 00:27:35,239
We know that Reverend Hartley's
been pressuring you...

393
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:39,326
...but this is the third death
linked with the Miracle Ministry.

394
00:27:39,409 --> 00:27:43,372
Reverend Hartley says
an autopsy is against scripture.

395
00:27:43,455 --> 00:27:46,583
What illness did your daughter
suffer from, Mr Hohman?

396
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:48,836
She had MS.

397
00:27:48,919 --> 00:27:51,380
Has she ever had a seizure before this?

398
00:27:51,463 --> 00:27:53,423
Not to my knowledge.

399
00:27:53,507 --> 00:27:55,592
You see, I think...

400
00:27:55,676 --> 00:28:00,681
...that the seizure she had is indicative
of some kind of embolism or aneurysm.

401
00:28:00,764 --> 00:28:03,350
The boy only touched her forehead.

402
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:05,519
And are you going to be content...

403
00:28:05,602 --> 00:28:08,272
...to bury her...

404
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:11,149
...without knowing the true cause of death?

405
00:28:11,275 --> 00:28:14,278
Without knowing
if there was foul play involved?

406
00:28:17,281 --> 00:28:19,324
Give me a moment.

407
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:32,462
You think the boy really did it?

408
00:28:33,338 --> 00:28:34,381
No.

409
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:36,133
Why not?

410
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:38,594
I was raised a Catholic.

411
00:28:38,677 --> 00:28:42,306
I have a certain familiarity
with the scripture.

412
00:28:43,974 --> 00:28:46,435
And God never lets the devil steal the show.

413
00:28:46,518 --> 00:28:48,645
You must have liked <i>The Exorcist.</i>

414
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:51,064
One of my favourite movies.

415
00:28:56,153 --> 00:28:58,822
So, who were you pursuing
in the crowd tonight?

416
00:29:00,991 --> 00:29:03,076
I thought I saw someone I knew.

417
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,913
The boy really has you going, doesn't he?

418
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:08,165
Why do you say that?

419
00:29:08,248 --> 00:29:10,626
In the bar, Samuel mentioned your sister.

420
00:29:10,709 --> 00:29:13,670
Is it your sister you keep
thinking you're seeing?

421
00:29:14,838 --> 00:29:16,924
I've seen her twice now.

422
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:21,094
- Maybe you just want to see her.
- I'm not delusional, Scully.

423
00:29:21,178 --> 00:29:23,513
Don't discount the power of suggestion.

424
00:29:23,597 --> 00:29:28,310
A healer's greatest magic lies in
the patient's willingness to believe.

425
00:29:28,393 --> 00:29:32,689
Imagine a miracle and you're halfway there.
We learned that in med school.

426
00:29:32,773 --> 00:29:37,361
You think this is what Margaret Hohman
and her parents were imagining?

427
00:29:43,617 --> 00:29:46,536
We're going to go along
with your investigation.

428
00:29:58,048 --> 00:30:00,717
It's 11.21pm, March 7th.

429
00:30:01,802 --> 00:30:04,304
Subject's name is Margaret Hohman.

430
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:06,765
Female, Caucasian...

431
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,934
...107 pounds.

432
00:30:16,066 --> 00:30:18,485
- Mulder, take a look at this.
- Do I have to?

433
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:22,572
Lesions on the lungs. I'm finding them
throughout the cardiovascular...

434
00:30:22,656 --> 00:30:25,909
...and pulmonary systems.
There's also a lot of damage...

435
00:30:25,993 --> 00:30:31,748
...to the mucus membranes. I think that
she must have died from cellular hypoxia.

436
00:30:31,832 --> 00:30:33,917
A lack of oxygen to the cells.

437
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:36,086
- What would cause that?
- My guess...

438
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:39,715
...ingestion or injection
of sodium or potassium cyanide.

439
00:30:39,798 --> 00:30:43,385
Maybe arsenic. I won't know exactly
until I run a toxicology screen.

440
00:30:43,468 --> 00:30:46,013
- How soon?
- Labs won't be open till morning.

441
00:30:46,096 --> 00:30:48,765
See who you can push to do it.
As soon as possible.

442
00:31:04,823 --> 00:31:06,950
Samuel? It's Agent Mulder.

443
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:10,954
Yeah? What do you want?

444
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:14,666
I want to talk with you.
If you'd prefer your attorney were present...

445
00:31:14,791 --> 00:31:17,127
Whatever. No.

446
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:21,006
I put a call in to Sheriff Daniels.
He's on his way down here.

447
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:23,300
I'm going to ask him to release you.

448
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:26,136
Why are you doing this?

449
00:31:26,219 --> 00:31:29,222
You were there, man. You saw for yourself.

450
00:31:30,307 --> 00:31:32,726
Did you poison Margaret Hohman?

451
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:34,478
Did I poison her?

452
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:39,649
Did you poison her using potassium or
sodium cyanide? That's what killed her.

453
00:31:40,525 --> 00:31:44,196
- What are you talking about?
- You're innocent, Samuel.

454
00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:47,866
Unless you had a hand in administering it,
and I don't think you did.

455
00:31:47,991 --> 00:31:51,787
- Whatever the cause, I am responsible!
- The evidence will be...

456
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:55,999
...presented tomorrow. Habeas corpus
law will force them to release you.

457
00:31:56,083 --> 00:31:59,753
- You might as well go home and rest.
- Just leave me alone, OK?

458
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:04,174
If you think that the punishment for
your sins is the deaths of those people...

459
00:32:04,257 --> 00:32:06,843
The Lord has testified against me,
Mr Mulder!

460
00:32:06,927 --> 00:32:09,638
I can't argue with your biblical rhetoric,

461
00:32:09,721 --> 00:32:14,351
but I do know that the law
will find you innocent!

462
00:32:19,856 --> 00:32:21,900
You said you could see my pain.

463
00:32:23,527 --> 00:32:25,195
Look at me.

464
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,408
What do you see now?

465
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:33,453
I see nothing.

466
00:32:34,454 --> 00:32:36,123
I'm blind.

467
00:32:37,082 --> 00:32:40,460
I don't believe you. I've seen her.

468
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:44,881
- It was her, wasn't it?
- Your sister?

469
00:32:44,965 --> 00:32:47,092
You made her appear to me, didn't you?

470
00:32:49,136 --> 00:32:51,513
- Look at me!
- I am very tired, Mr Mulder.

471
00:32:51,596 --> 00:32:53,807
Is she alive?!

472
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:56,726
Is that what I'm meant to believe
or is this a trick?

473
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:01,690
You mean...

474
00:33:01,773 --> 00:33:03,900
...a trick of the devil?

475
00:33:06,444 --> 00:33:08,113
Jailer!

476
00:33:25,422 --> 00:33:29,843
- I see I'm a little late for this ball.
- I called you down here to release the boy.

477
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:32,137
- On what pretence?
- His innocence.

478
00:33:32,262 --> 00:33:34,764
Aren't you a little out of your depth here?

479
00:33:34,848 --> 00:33:38,810
This may be hicksville to you,
but we do try and hew to the legal system.

480
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:41,771
I don't want a fight.
He's determined to stay anyway.

481
00:33:41,855 --> 00:33:43,565
What does that tell you?

482
00:33:43,648 --> 00:33:46,026
It tells me you're determined
to charge him...

483
00:33:46,109 --> 00:33:49,821
...while your real homicide suspect
is still at large.

484
00:34:07,505 --> 00:34:09,466
Got some company for you, Sam.

485
00:34:22,896 --> 00:34:24,981
What are you looking at?

486
00:34:46,711 --> 00:34:48,880
I'll get it. I'll get it.

487
00:34:56,096 --> 00:34:58,223
Ma'am. Sheriff.

488
00:34:58,348 --> 00:34:59,557
Hey, Dennis.

489
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:02,435
- How are you?
- Just fine, ma'am. Just fine.

490
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:07,023
- Except we had an incident at the jail.
- What incident, Tyson?

491
00:35:08,358 --> 00:35:11,528
The preacher boy... He's dead.

492
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:24,207
He was alone when Mulder left him
this morning. How could this happen?

493
00:35:24,291 --> 00:35:28,920
The boy started a fight with
a couple of rowdies we picked up on a DUI.

494
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:33,925
Took some pretty mean blows to the head.
Died before the ambulance got here.

495
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:38,805
- His blood is spilled and it's all over you!
- Reverend...

496
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:47,772
How long will you hide behind that badge
before the truth is revealed?

497
00:35:47,897 --> 00:35:50,608
I have work to do.

498
00:35:50,734 --> 00:35:52,777
Reverend Hartley...

499
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:56,906
We're sorry for your loss.

500
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,492
That boy...

501
00:35:59,576 --> 00:36:01,786
He was blessed.

502
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:03,955
He never hurt a soul.

503
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,458
Our friends will know
about Samuel...

504
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:10,628
...sooner than later. And it's probably
best if they hear it from you.

505
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:12,005
Come on.

506
00:36:12,088 --> 00:36:14,007
Ma'am.

507
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:20,430
You've got that look on your face.

508
00:36:21,264 --> 00:36:23,350
What look is that?

509
00:21:07,226 --> 00:21:12,731
committed for grinding up six
co-eds that he tricked into his basement.

510
00:21:12,857 --> 00:21:16,527
He used their flesh
as fertiliser in his garden.

511
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:22,825
If Kobold's part of this, why is he still behind
bars? Why not escape when he had chance?

512
00:21:23,325 --> 00:21:25,703
I don't know yet.

513
00:21:27,413 --> 00:21:30,166
You believe this guy, Agent Scully?

514
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:33,544
I haven't formed an opinion about it yet,
actually.

515
00:21:35,087 --> 00:21:38,048
That's great. Just great.

516
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:41,802
Where are you going, Monica?

517
00:21:41,886 --> 00:21:46,390
This man Kobold can help us, John.
I'm gonna prove it to you.

518
00:37:16,986 --> 00:37:19,114
Scully!

519
00:37:19,197 --> 00:37:21,324
It's potato.

520
00:37:22,826 --> 00:37:24,911
Someone left a trail of food...

521
00:37:24,994 --> 00:37:28,164
...in the ventilation system
leading to the courtroom.

522
00:37:28,248 --> 00:37:30,250
You dump your locusts in here...

523
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:33,545
- Instant plague.
- Where did they all come from?

524
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:38,925
Biological supply houses usually hatch them
on order to farms and universities.

525
00:37:39,008 --> 00:37:41,886
It shouldn't be too hard
to find out who set this up.

526
00:37:42,011 --> 00:37:45,807
And you think whoever did this
is responsible for the murders?

527
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:17,839
You're dead.

528
00:38:17,922 --> 00:38:20,049
They killed you.

529
00:38:21,384 --> 00:38:23,678
I was dead.

530
00:38:23,761 --> 00:38:25,847
- But here I am.
- No!

531
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:27,724
Why did you betray me?

532
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:34,397
You murdered those people.

533
00:38:36,566 --> 00:38:38,610
They came to me to be healed...

534
00:38:39,277 --> 00:38:41,696
...and you murdered them.

535
00:38:41,779 --> 00:38:43,448
Why?

536
00:38:44,157 --> 00:38:46,451
After I gave you back your life.

537
00:38:46,576 --> 00:38:48,661
You call this life?!

538
00:38:56,419 --> 00:38:58,421
What in tarnation do you want?

539
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:01,633
We're here to arrest Leonard Vance.
Where is he?

540
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:04,761
- You must be mistaken.
<i>- </i> I'm afraid not.

541
00:39:04,844 --> 00:39:08,556
We traced a pesticide order to him
from a company in Knoxville.

542
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,267
Cyanogen bromide -
it's a cyanide derivative.

543
00:39:11,351 --> 00:39:13,436
Leonard poisoned those people.

544
00:39:22,028 --> 00:39:24,739
Get your clothes on, Vance.
You're under arrest.

545
00:39:24,822 --> 00:39:27,116
I betrayed him.

546
00:39:28,993 --> 00:39:32,413
Cyanide. There's no way to tell
how much he's ingested.

547
00:39:32,497 --> 00:39:34,582
I'll call an ambulance.

548
00:39:34,666 --> 00:39:37,377
- No, we have to take him ourselves.
- I thought...

549
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,546
..."Why didn't he let me die?"

550
00:39:40,797 --> 00:39:44,884
Beware of false prophets
who come to you in sheep's clothing...

551
00:39:44,968 --> 00:39:47,053
...but inwardly are...

552
00:39:47,136 --> 00:39:49,013
...are ravening wolves!

553
00:39:49,138 --> 00:39:51,140
That's what I thought he was...

554
00:39:51,224 --> 00:39:54,227
...because who else would bring me back...

555
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:56,354
...looking like this!

556
00:39:56,479 --> 00:39:58,731
He was here.

557
00:39:58,815 --> 00:40:01,317
- Who?
- Samuel.

558
00:40:01,401 --> 00:40:04,279
- The man's delirious.
- He was here, reverend.

559
00:40:04,362 --> 00:40:06,489
Right in this room.

560
00:40:08,157 --> 00:40:10,243
And he forgave me.

561
00:40:20,837 --> 00:40:26,551
<i>Rather than simply killing Samuel, Vance</i>
<i>contrived to kill the ministry's faith in him.</i>

562
00:40:26,676 --> 00:40:30,847
<i>We have evidence connecting him</i>
<i>both to the courtroom infestation...</i>

563
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:34,517
<i>.. and to the poisoning deaths</i>
<i>of three members of the ministry.</i>

564
00:40:35,727 --> 00:40:38,855
<i>Vance's obsession</i>
<i>outlived Samuel, however.</i>

565
00:40:38,938 --> 00:40:44,068
<i>His conscience haunted him until he became</i>
<i>delusory and finally took his own life...</i>

566
00:40:44,193 --> 00:40:47,572
<i>.. effectively ending our investigation.</i>

567
00:40:47,697 --> 00:40:52,035
<i>In light of this information, it is highly</i>
<i>doubtful that there have ever been...</i>

568
00:40:52,118 --> 00:40:54,370
<i>.. any miracles in Kenwood, Tennessee.</i>

569
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:02,629
Mulder.

570
00:41:05,798 --> 00:41:07,467
Scully?

571
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:15,391
Sheriff Daniels just called.
Samuel's body's missing from the morgue.

572
00:41:19,228 --> 00:41:20,897
Any witnesses?

573
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:24,984
One so far. The night nurse
who made the report - Beatrice Salinger.

574
00:41:26,736 --> 00:41:29,739
- She saw somebody take the body?
- Not actually.

575
00:41:29,822 --> 00:41:32,116
- What do you mean?
- Talk sense, deputy.

576
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:35,620
She didn't exactly see anyone
taking the body.

577
00:41:35,745 --> 00:41:37,789
- Well, what then?
- She, uh...

578
00:41:38,831 --> 00:41:41,834
She claims she saw Samuel
walking out by himself.

579
00:41:41,918 --> 00:41:44,212
Sounds crazy, I know, but...

580
00:41:44,295 --> 00:41:46,422
...that's what she told me.

581
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:49,175
You coming, sheriff?

582
00:41:53,763 --> 00:41:55,807
I was drinking my coffee...

583
00:41:55,932 --> 00:41:59,602
...and going over the night orders
for my ward, 7 South...

584
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:01,771
...when he walked right by me.

585
00:42:01,854 --> 00:42:03,981
His face was all black and blue.

586
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:05,525
And you're sure it was him?

587
00:42:05,608 --> 00:42:10,822
At first I thought my eyes were playing
tricks, which happens a lot on graveyard.

588
00:42:11,781 --> 00:42:15,368
So I got up to look again,
but I lost him round a corner.

589
00:42:15,451 --> 00:42:19,664
He just vanished.
Then I went to check the morgue...

590
00:42:19,789 --> 00:42:21,833
...and his body was gone.

591
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:27,171
I don't believe this. This is insane.
I'm not listening to this woman's crazy talk.

592
00:42:27,296 --> 00:42:31,467
I'm not the only one who saw him, sheriff!
So I know I'm not crazy.

593
00:42:31,551 --> 00:42:33,511
Other people saw him, too.

594
00:42:37,974 --> 00:42:40,017
I'm not crazy.

595
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:42,228
It was Samuel.

596
00:43:08,921 --> 00:43:11,007
This isn't true, Maurice...

597
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:12,800
...is it?

598
00:43:12,884 --> 00:43:17,096
The boy was an awful fake,
just like you said, wasn't he, Maurice?

599
00:43:22,018 --> 00:43:24,061
Wasn't he, Maurice?

600
00:43:40,286 --> 00:43:42,747
Sir, I'm gonna have to ask you...

601
00:43:42,872 --> 00:43:44,499
...to come with me.

602
00:43:44,582 --> 00:43:49,712
District attorney wants to ask you
some questions concerning the boy's death.

603
00:43:55,259 --> 00:43:58,638
Sundays will probably
never be the same again in these parts.

604
00:43:58,721 --> 00:44:02,725
I have a strong sense the reverend
won't be able to give up the pulpit.

605
00:44:02,809 --> 00:44:06,979
- Even without his son?
- It might even strengthen his faith.

606
00:44:07,063 --> 00:44:09,148
The boy did rise from the dead.

607
00:44:09,232 --> 00:44:13,110
That kind of thing happens only
once or twice every two thousand years.

608
00:44:13,236 --> 00:44:16,739
Yeah, and I have a story
about a plague of locusts.

609
00:44:16,823 --> 00:44:21,744
I hope Reverend Hartley didn't arrange this
body snatching as his miracle of miracles.

610
00:44:21,828 --> 00:44:25,414
- Somehow I don't think so.
- What exactly do you think?

611
00:44:25,498 --> 00:44:28,167
I think people are looking hard
for miracles...

612
00:44:28,251 --> 00:44:32,630
...so hard that maybe they make themselves
see what they want to see.

613
00:44:46,686 --> 00:44:48,771
Are you coming, Mulder?

614
00:45:41,782 --> 00:45:42,783
Helen Stewart

615
00:45:42,867 --> 00:45:44,827
<i>I made this!</i>
