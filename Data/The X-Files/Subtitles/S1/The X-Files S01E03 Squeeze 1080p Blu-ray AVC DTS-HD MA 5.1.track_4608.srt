<i>Please leave a message at the tone.
Thank you.</i>

5
00:01:43,354 --> 00:01:47,858
Hi, honey. It's about 8.30
and, um... I'm going to be here for a while.

6
00:01:47,942 --> 00:01:50,194
The presentation didn't go so well.

7
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:52,363
Call me. I love you. Bye.

<i>(heavy breathing)</i>

11
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:11,710
Guess who I ran into
from our class at Quantico?

12
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:15,005
- Marty Neil.
- J Edgar Jr?

13
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:17,174
Just got bumped up.

14
00:04:17,258 --> 00:04:20,219
Foreign Counterintelligence,
New York City Bureau.

15
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:22,388
Supervisory Special Agent.

16
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:24,515
- Supervisory?
- That's right.

17
00:04:24,849 --> 00:04:27,435
Two years out of the Academy.
How did he land that?

18
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:29,854
Lucked into the World Trade Center
bombing.

19
00:04:30,563 --> 00:04:32,064
Well, good for Marty.

20
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:35,484
Oh, come on, Dana! The guy is a loser.
Look where he is now.

21
00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:37,528
It's where we should be.

22
00:04:37,653 --> 00:04:41,282
Brad Wilson told me
the psychological profile you wrote...

23
00:04:41,365 --> 00:04:45,411
...on the Washington Crossing killer
led them straight to the suspect.

24
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:49,457
Word has it you're on
the Violent Crimes Section's fast track.

25
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:51,083
So, how are you doing?

26
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:55,379
Have you had any close encounters
of the third kind?

27
00:04:57,006 --> 00:04:59,425
Is that what everyone thinks I do?

28
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:03,804
No, of course not.
But you do work with Spooky Mulder.

29
00:05:03,888 --> 00:05:08,476
Mulder's ideas may be a bit out there,
but he is a great agent.

30
00:05:08,559 --> 00:05:11,520
Yeah, well, I've got this case
that's out there.

31
00:05:12,229 --> 00:05:13,939
Baltimore PD calls.

32
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:17,109
They want our help on a serial killer profile.

33
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:21,280
Three murders. Began six weeks ago.
Victims vary in age, race, gender.

34
00:05:21,405 --> 00:05:24,408
- No known connections.
- I take it there's a pattern?

35
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,785
Point of entry.
Actually, the lack of one.

36
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,370
What do you mean?

37
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:31,165
One victim, college girl,
killed in her dorm room.

38
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:35,211
She was found with the windows locked
and the door chained from the inside.

39
00:05:35,294 --> 00:05:39,340
The last incident, two days ago.
High-security office building.

40
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:43,969
Nothing on the security monitors.
Janitor spoke to the victim minutes before.

41
00:05:44,094 --> 00:05:46,680
Didn't hear or see a thing
out of the ordinary.

42
00:05:46,764 --> 00:05:47,890
Suicides?

43
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:57,274
Each victim was found
with their liver ripped out.

44
00:05:58,984 --> 00:06:01,612
- No cutting tool was used.
- Bare hands?

45
00:06:03,572 --> 00:06:06,784
- This looks like an X-File.
- Let's not get carried away.

46
00:06:06,909 --> 00:06:09,161
I'm gonna solve these murders, but...

47
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:12,122
...I would like you
to go over the case histories.

48
00:06:12,248 --> 00:06:15,084
Maybe come down to the crime scene.

49
00:06:15,167 --> 00:06:17,378
Do you want me to ask Mulder?

50
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:21,131
OK. If he wants to come
and do you a favour, great!

51
00:06:21,257 --> 00:06:24,009
But make sure he knows this is my case.

52
00:06:24,134 --> 00:06:27,346
Dana, if I can break a case like this one...

53
00:06:27,471 --> 00:06:29,974
...I'll be getting my bump up the ladder.

54
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:31,600
And you...

55
00:06:33,143 --> 00:06:35,854
Maybe you won't have to be
Mrs Spooky any more.

56
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:43,362
- <i>(Mulder)</i> So why didn't they ask me?
- They're friends from the Academy.

57
00:06:43,487 --> 00:06:46,657
I'm sure they just felt
more comfortable talking to me.

58
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:48,867
Why would I make them so uncomfortable?

59
00:06:48,951 --> 00:06:52,288
It probably has to do with your reputation.

60
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:55,374
Reputation? I have a reputation?

61
00:06:55,499 --> 00:07:00,838
Colton plays by the book and you don't.
They feel your methods, your theories are...

62
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:02,172
Spooky?

63
00:07:04,133 --> 00:07:07,636
- Do you think I'm spooky?
- <i>(man)</i> Agent Scully's in here, sir.

64
00:07:08,304 --> 00:07:09,597
Dana!

65
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,348
Sorry I'm late.

66
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:13,309
We just got here.

67
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:16,186
Uh... Fox Mulder. Tom Colton.

68
00:07:17,313 --> 00:07:21,650
So, Mulder, what do you think? Does this
look like the work of little green men?

69
00:07:21,734 --> 00:07:23,611
- Grey.
- Excuse me?

70
00:07:23,694 --> 00:07:24,695
Grey.

71
00:07:24,820 --> 00:07:28,240
You said green men.
A Reticulan skin tone is actually grey.

72
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:32,369
They're notorious for their extraction
of terrestrial human livers...

73
00:07:32,494 --> 00:07:35,164
...due to iron depletion
in the Reticulan galaxy.

74
00:07:35,247 --> 00:07:36,624
You can't be serious!

75
00:07:36,707 --> 00:07:40,127
Do you have any idea what
liver and onions go for on Reticula?

76
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,712
Excuse me.

77
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:50,179
(Colton) Dana, I've been thinking about this
and I have a theory.

78
00:07:50,262 --> 00:07:52,848
It might explain a lot.
Tell me what you think.

79
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,225
What if the guy enters the building...

80
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:12,534
Hold on a second.
What in the hell is he doing?

81
00:08:16,789 --> 00:08:19,458
Uh, that vent is 6 inches by about 18.

82
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:24,213
Even if a Reticulan could crawl through,
it's screwed in place.

83
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:34,598
<i>(Mulder)</i> This is the print
I took from Usher's office.

84
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:37,434
These others are from an X-File.

85
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:41,271
Ten murders, Baltimore area,
undetermined points of entry.

86
00:08:41,397 --> 00:08:43,607
Each victim had their liver removed.

87
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:46,610
These prints were found
at <i>5</i> of the 10 crime scenes.

88
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:51,657
- Ten murders. Colton never mentioned...
- Most likely he's unaware of them.

89
00:08:51,782 --> 00:08:56,662
These two prints were lifted five years
before he was born at Powhattan Mill.

90
00:08:56,787 --> 00:09:02,668
And these three were lifted probably
five years before his mother was even born.

91
00:09:02,835 --> 00:09:06,630
Are you saying these prints
are from the 1960s and the 1930s?

92
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:12,469
Fingerprinting was just starting in 1903, but
there was a murder with an extracted liver.

93
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:13,846
Of course.

94
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:19,143
Now, that's five murders every 30 years.
That makes two more to go this year.

95
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:21,311
You're saying these are copycats?

96
00:09:21,437 --> 00:09:23,897
What did we learn our first day
at the Academy?

97
00:09:23,981 --> 00:09:27,443
Each fingerprint is unique.
These are a perfect match.

98
00:09:27,526 --> 00:09:30,946
Are you suggesting I go before
the Violent Crimes Section...

99
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:34,908
...and present a profile saying
these murders are done by aliens?

100
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:37,494
No! I find no evidence of alien involvement.

101
00:09:37,619 --> 00:09:40,914
What, then? This is the work
of a 100-year-old serial killer...

102
00:09:40,998 --> 00:09:43,834
...who overpowered
a six-foot-two businessman?

103
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:46,545
He'll stick out in a crowd
with ten-inch fingers!

104
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:49,631
Look, bottom line.

105
00:09:49,715 --> 00:09:51,800
This is Colton's case.

106
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:54,970
Our X-File dates back to 1903.
We had it first.

107
00:09:55,053 --> 00:10:00,184
Mulder, they don't want you involved.
They don't want to hear your theories.

108
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:03,312
That's why Blevins
has you hidden away down here.

109
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:04,855
You're down here, too.

110
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,065
Look, why don't we agree to this?

111
00:10:07,191 --> 00:10:11,361
They have their investigation, we have ours.
And never the twain shall meet.

112
00:10:13,155 --> 00:10:14,656
Agreed?

113
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:24,541
<i>(Scully) After a careful review of the violent
and powerful nature of these murders...</i>

114
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:30,881
<i>...I believe the killer to be a male, 25-35 years
of age, with above average intelligence.</i>

115
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:35,177
<i>His manner of entry
has so far been undetectable.</i>

116
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:37,638
<i>This may be due to his knowledge</i>

117
00:10:37,721 --> 00:10:40,974
<i>of the inner structure
of buildings and duct works.</i>

118
00:10:41,058 --> 00:10:47,064
<i>Or that he in fact hides in plain sight
posing as delivery or maintenance workers.</i>

119
00:10:59,076 --> 00:11:03,664
<i>The extraction of the liver is the most
significant detail of these crimes.</i>

120
00:11:03,747 --> 00:11:08,961
<i>The liver possesses regenerative qualities.
It cleanses the blood.</i>

121
00:11:09,628 --> 00:11:13,632
The taking of this trophy
is the transferring act for the killer to...

122
00:11:13,757 --> 00:11:16,301
...cleanse himself of his own impurities.

123
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:22,266
I think he is acting under the classic form
of obsessive-compulsive behaviour.

124
00:11:22,933 --> 00:11:27,145
Since the victims are unrelated
and we cannot predict who will be next...

125
00:11:27,271 --> 00:11:31,441
...we must use the fact that a killer
won't always succeed in finding a victim.

126
00:11:31,567 --> 00:11:33,402
When this occurs...

127
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:37,281
...a serial killer may return to
the site of a previous murder...

128
00:11:37,406 --> 00:11:40,450
...hoping to recapture the emotional high.

129
00:11:41,785 --> 00:11:45,581
I think our best course of action
is to target these sites.

130
00:11:45,664 --> 00:11:47,791
Good job, Agent Scully.

131
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:52,462
If there are no objections, we'll begin
our stakeouts of the murder sites tonight.

132
00:11:52,588 --> 00:11:56,758
We're looking for a male, 25-35,
possibly wearing a uniform.

133
00:11:56,842 --> 00:12:01,305
Gas company, UPS, whatever. I know
you're assigned to another area, Scully...

134
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:04,725
...but you're welcome
to come aboard with us on this.

135
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:09,104
That is if you don't mind working in an area
that's a bit more down to earth.

136
00:12:09,187 --> 00:12:11,440

00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:04,326
- Mulder, what are you doing here?
- He's not coming back.

145
00:13:04,409 --> 00:13:08,664
His thrill comes from the challenge
of a seemingly impossible entry.

146
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:12,084
If you'd read the X-File,
you'd come to the same conclusion.

147
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:15,671
- Mulder, you are jeopardising my stakeout.
- Seeds?

148
00:13:16,088 --> 00:13:18,173
You're wasting your time.

00:15:07,949 --> 00:15:10,869
Is your full name Eugene Victor Tooms?

168
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:13,121
[FBI BUREAU
BALTIMORE, MARYLAND]

169
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:14,623
Yes.

170
00:15:15,165 --> 00:15:18,502
Are you a resident of the state of Maryland?

171
00:15:19,711 --> 00:15:21,171
Yes.

172
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:26,635
Are you an employee
of the Baltimore Municipal Animal Control?

173
00:15:27,677 --> 00:15:29,137
Yes.

174
00:15:29,721 --> 00:15:33,683
Is it your intent to lie to me
about anything here today?

175
00:15:35,227 --> 00:15:36,394
No.

176
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:39,856
Were you ever enrolled in college?

177
00:15:41,525 --> 00:15:42,859
<i>Yes.</i>

178
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:46,321
<i>Were you ever enrolled in medical school?</i>

179
00:15:47,697 --> 00:15:48,907
<i>No.</i>

180
00:15:49,366 --> 00:15:52,369
<i>Have you ever removed a liver
from a human being?</i>

181
00:15:54,204 --> 00:15:55,580
No.

182
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:58,875
Have you ever killed a living creature?

183
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:03,755
Yes.

184
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:07,050
Have you ever killed a human being?

185
00:16:08,051 --> 00:16:09,886
No.

186
00:16:11,012 --> 00:16:13,557
Were you ever in George Usher's office?

187
00:16:14,724 --> 00:16:16,059
No.

188
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,937
Did you kill George Usher?

189
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:21,940
No.

190
00:16:23,024 --> 00:16:25,360
Are you over 100 years old?

191
00:16:25,443 --> 00:16:28,530
- That must be a control question.
- I had her ask it.

192
00:16:29,447 --> 00:16:30,949
No.

193
00:16:32,742 --> 00:16:35,579
Have you ever been to Powhattan Mill?

194
00:16:35,871 --> 00:16:37,122
Yes.

195
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:38,790
In 1933?

196
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:44,588
No.

197
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,884
Are you afraid you might fail this test?

198
00:16:50,135 --> 00:16:51,928
Well...

199
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:57,559
Yes. Because I didn't do anything.

200
00:16:58,643 --> 00:17:00,270
He nailed it... A+.

201
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:04,441
As far as I'm concerned,
the subject did not kill those two people.

202
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:13,491
Maintenance at the office building
confirmed the call to Animal Control...

203
00:17:13,617 --> 00:17:18,246
...about a bad smell. They found a dead cat
in the second floor ventilation ducts.

204
00:17:18,330 --> 00:17:21,625
Still doesn't explain why he was there
that late at night.

205
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:25,045
He's a civil servant with initiative
and we busted him for it.

206
00:17:25,128 --> 00:17:29,132
He was crawling up an air duct,
by himself, without alerting security.

207
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,884
Dana, he passed the test.

208
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:35,388
His story checks out. He's not the guy.
It doesn't mean your profile's incorrect.

209
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:37,807
Scully's right. It is the guy.

210
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:40,852
What have you got, Mulder?

211
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:43,104
He lied on questions 11 and 13.

212
00:17:43,188 --> 00:17:47,108
His electrodermal and cardiographic
response nearly go off the chart.

213
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:50,528
Is number 11 the 100-year-old question?

214
00:17:52,364 --> 00:17:55,200
Well, I had a reaction
to that stupid question.

215
00:17:55,283 --> 00:17:57,202
And what is this Powhattan Mill thing?

216
00:17:57,327 --> 00:18:02,707
Two murders with matching MOS occurred
in Powhattan Mill in 1933. Look at the chart.

217
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,459
My interpretation of those reactions...

218
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:08,797
I don't need you or that machine
telling me if Tooms was alive in '33!

219
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,882
He's the guy.

220
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:13,677
I'm letting him go.

221
00:18:16,846 --> 00:18:18,473
You coming?

222
00:18:19,683 --> 00:18:23,603
Tom, I want to thank you for letting me
put in some time with the VCS.

223
00:18:23,687 --> 00:18:28,316
- But I am officially assigned to the X-Files.
- I'll see what I can do about that.

224
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,652
Tom, I can look out for myself.

225
00:18:30,735 --> 00:18:32,862
You said Mulder was out there.

226
00:18:33,196 --> 00:18:35,240
That guy's insane.

227
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,959
You knew they wouldn't believe you.
Why did you push it?

228
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:48,837
Maybe I thought you caught the right guy.

229
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:52,799
And maybe I run into so many people
who are hostile...

230
00:18:52,882 --> 00:18:56,344
...because they can't open their minds
to the possibilities...

231
00:18:56,428 --> 00:18:59,472
...that sometimes
the need to mess with their heads...

232
00:18:59,556 --> 00:19:02,851
...outweighs the millstone of humiliation.

233
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:06,438
It seems like you were acting
very territorial.

234
00:19:06,563 --> 00:19:08,690
- I don't know...
- Of course I was.

235
00:19:08,773 --> 00:19:12,152
In our investigations,
you may not always agree with me...

236
00:19:12,235 --> 00:19:14,738
...but at least you respect the journey.

237
00:19:14,863 --> 00:19:19,868
And if you want to continue working
with them, I won't hold it against you.

238
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:28,543
I don't know. You must have something
more than your polygraph interpretation...

239
00:19:28,626 --> 00:19:32,756
...to back up this bizarre theory
and I have to see what it is.

240
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:38,928
<i>(Mulder)</i> These are Eugene Tooms's prints.

241
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:48,104
This is the fingerprint
they took from Usher's office.

242
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:50,899
It matches the old ones from the X-Files.

243
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:52,734
Obviously no match.

244
00:19:53,568 --> 00:19:55,070

Look, at this point I'm willing
to give any theory a shot!

258
00:23:41,671 --> 00:23:46,968
Any sane theory. Dana, I only want qualified
members of the team at the crime scene.

259
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:50,888
What's the matter?
You worried I'm going to solve your case?

260
00:23:51,014 --> 00:23:55,393
Tom, we have authorised access
to this crime scene.

261
00:23:56,352 --> 00:24:01,482
A report of you obstructing another officer's
investigation might stick out on your file.

262
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:08,281
Look, Dana, whose side are you on?

263
00:24:08,364 --> 00:24:09,657
The victim's.

00:24:15,705 --> 00:24:18,207
105 inches from the fireplace.

265
00:24:24,047 --> 00:24:26,799
The victim is 3 Thomas Werner,
single, white...

266
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:28,259
It's Tooms.

267
00:24:30,678 --> 00:24:32,722
And he took something.

268
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:43,024
[COUNTY CENSUS 1903]

269
00:24:48,071 --> 00:24:51,783
Baltimore PD checked out
Tooms's apartment. It was a cover.

270
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:56,412
No one has ever lived there and he hasn't
shown up for work since the arrest.

271
00:24:56,537 --> 00:24:58,289
I found him.

272
00:24:58,414 --> 00:25:01,250
How do we learn about the present?
We look to the past.

273
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:05,338
I think this is where it all began
in 1903, on Exeter Street.

274
00:25:05,421 --> 00:25:08,383
Look at the address
of that first murder in 1903.

275
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,596
Apartment 203.

276
00:25:14,597 --> 00:25:16,683
He killed the guy above him.

277
00:25:16,766 --> 00:25:18,935
Maybe he played the Victrola too loud.

278
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:22,772
- This must be Tooms's great-grandfather.
- What about the prints?

279
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:24,857
Genetics might explain the patterns.

280
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:28,486
It also might explain
the sociopathic attitudes and behaviours.

281
00:25:28,611 --> 00:25:30,405
It begins with one family member

282

00:25:35,618 --> 00:25:37,286
What do you think?

285
00:25:37,412 --> 00:25:41,666
I think we have to track Eugene Tooms.
There's four down and one to go this year.

286
00:25:41,791 --> 00:25:44,961
If we don't get him right now,
the next chance will be in...

You'll be head of the Bureau by then.
You go through the census.

- Nope.

00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:43,895
Oh, I did find one thing, though.

296
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,981
It's the current address
of the investigating officer

297
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:49,525
of the Powhattan Mill murders in 1933.

298
00:26:51,402 --> 00:26:54,655
I've been waiting 25 years for you.

299
00:26:54,739 --> 00:26:56,574
Sir?

300
00:26:56,699 --> 00:27:00,119
I called it quits in 1968...

301
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:03,206
...after 45 years as a cop.

302
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,543
And those killings at Powhattan Mill...

303
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:12,715
I was a sheriff then
and I'd seen my share of murders.

304
00:27:14,008 --> 00:27:16,052
Bloody ones.

305
00:27:16,719 --> 00:27:19,013
But I could go home and...

306
00:27:20,348 --> 00:27:24,435
...pitch a few baseballs to my kid
and never give it a second thought.

307
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:29,357
You gotta be able to do that.
You... you'd go crazy, right?

308
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:33,611
But those murders in Powhattan Mill...

309
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:39,909
When I walked into that room,
my heart went cold.

310
00:27:41,244 --> 00:27:44,372
My hands... numbed.

311
00:27:46,207 --> 00:27:48,251
I could feel...

312
00:27:49,252 --> 00:27:50,711
...it!

313
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:52,922
Feel what, Frank?

314
00:27:55,716 --> 00:28:00,429
When I first heard about
the death camps in 1945...

315
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:03,266
...I remembered Powhattan Mill.

316
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:07,311
And I see the Kurds and the Bosnians.

317
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:10,898
That room is there, I tell you.

318
00:28:10,982 --> 00:28:15,945
It's like all the horrible acts
that humans are capable of...

319
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:20,157
...somehow gave birth to some kind of...

320
00:28:20,741 --> 00:28:23,786
...human monster.

00:28:31,794 --> 00:28:35,798
There's a box in the trunk here.
Get it for me, would you, please?

324
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:47,977
Now, <i>this</i> is all the evidence I've collected.

325
00:28:48,477 --> 00:28:52,356
- Officially and unofficially.
- Unofficially?

326
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:58,654
I knew that the murders in '63
were by the same... person as in '33.

327
00:28:59,488 --> 00:29:02,491
But by then they had me
on a desk pushing papers...

328
00:29:02,617 --> 00:29:05,620
...and they wouldn't let me
anywhere near the case.

329
00:29:05,703 --> 00:29:08,289
- A piece of the removed liver?
- Yes.

330
00:29:08,372 --> 00:29:12,335
But, you know, that's not
the only trophy he took with him.

331
00:29:12,460 --> 00:29:18,049
Family members reported small
personal effects missing in each case.

332
00:29:18,174 --> 00:29:22,470
A hairbrush in the Walters murder.
A coffee mug in the Taylor murder.

333
00:29:23,971 --> 00:29:27,350
Have you ever heard
the name Eugene Victor Tooms?

334
00:29:27,475 --> 00:29:33,230
When they wouldn't bring me aboard in '63,
I... I did some of my own work.

335
00:29:33,356 --> 00:29:35,524
I took these surveillance pictures.

- It looks like the wall's deteriorating.
