1
00:00:08,134 --> 00:00:11,053
As soon as we're in position
we'll be on a count of five.

2
00:00:16,142 --> 00:00:19,729
- Excuse me, that's my house.
- OK, let her through.

3
00:00:19,812 --> 00:00:21,898
- What's going on?
- Mrs Budahas?

4
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:26,569
Your husband's violated security procedure
and stolen an armed military vehicle.

5
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:28,196
<i>(radio) Team One moving in.</i>

6
00:00:47,882 --> 00:00:49,884
You've got to let me talk to him.

7
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:05,441
What the hell...?

8
00:01:05,524 --> 00:01:08,945
<i>(radio) We got him.
But he's gonna need a doctor.</i>

9
00:01:09,028 --> 00:01:11,197
Or something.

10
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:35,031
Hi. I got your message.

11
00:02:35,114 --> 00:02:37,867
Sorry for the run-around.
Can I buy you a drink?

12
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:40,661
It's two in the afternoon,
Agent Mulder.

13
00:02:40,745 --> 00:02:43,581
That's not stopping
the rest of these people.

14
00:02:43,664 --> 00:02:47,835
- I got something to show you.
- Something you couldn't show me at work?

15
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,004
Let's get a table.

16
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:02,975
<i>(Mulder)</i> That's Colonel Robert Budahas.

17
00:03:03,059 --> 00:03:08,105
He was a test pilot for the military,
stationed at EIIens Air Base, Idaho.

18
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:12,610
Four months ago, Colonel Budahas
experienced a psychotic episode...

19
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:16,739
...and barricaded himself in his home.
Military police were called in.

20
00:03:16,822 --> 00:03:20,993
Budahas was removed and hospitalised
for the treatment of his condition.

21
00:03:21,077 --> 00:03:22,787
Which was what, exactly?

22
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,582
The military will not comment
on the cause, nature or status.

23
00:03:26,665 --> 00:03:30,669
In fact, the military will not comment
on Colonel Budahas at all.

24
00:03:30,753 --> 00:03:31,921
What do you mean?

25
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:37,343
Mrs Budahas has neither seen nor heard
from her husband in over four months.

26
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:42,473
Last month, she contacted the FBI
and reported it as a kidnapping.

27
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:46,352
Why would the military
kidnap one of their own pilots?

28
00:03:46,435 --> 00:03:49,980
That's the $64,000 question, Scully.

29
00:03:50,064 --> 00:03:55,194
Since 1963, six pilots have been listed
missing in action from EIIens Air Base.

30
00:03:55,277 --> 00:04:00,616
The military say these pilots accepted
the risks of flying experimental aircraft.

31
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:04,286
It's rumoured they were shot down
at high altitudes...

32
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:07,456
...while they were penetrating
Russian air space.

33
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,208
There were other rumours.

34
00:04:10,418 --> 00:04:14,797
I've been tracking this case since
it came through the Boise office.

35
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:17,800
Last week it was de-prioritised.

36
00:04:17,883 --> 00:04:21,429
They shelved it without an investigation.

37
00:04:21,512 --> 00:04:23,264
So...

38
00:04:23,347 --> 00:04:27,309
So we're going to the <i>spud</i> state
to investigate a kidnapping.

39
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:32,565
I don't get it, Mulder. Does this
have something to do with an X-File?

40
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:36,527
I thought you only liked
those paranormal-type cases.

41
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,821
Am I missing something here?

42
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:42,867
Let's just say
this case has a distinct smell to it.

43
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:44,994
A certain...

44
00:04:45,077 --> 00:04:47,496
...paranormal bouquet.

45
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:49,665
Excuse me.

46
00:05:10,478 --> 00:05:12,813
Leave this case alone, Agent Mulder.

47
00:05:13,772 --> 00:05:14,815
What?

48
00:05:14,899 --> 00:05:18,319
The military will not tolerate
an FBI investigation.

49
00:05:19,862 --> 00:05:21,113
Who are you?

50
00:05:21,197 --> 00:05:25,826
I... uh... can be of help to you.
I've had a certain interest in your work.

51
00:05:26,577 --> 00:05:27,620
<i>(knocking)</i>

52
00:05:28,078 --> 00:05:29,497
<i>(man)</i> Sorry.

53
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,165
How do you know about my work?

54
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:36,712
Well, let's just say that I'm in a position
to know quite a lot of things.

55
00:05:36,795 --> 00:05:38,714
Things about our government.

56
00:05:38,797 --> 00:05:40,883
Who are you? Who do you work for?

57
00:05:40,966 --> 00:05:45,763
It's unimportant. I came here
to give you some valuable advice.

58
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:50,434
You are exposing yourself
and Agent Scully to unnecessary risk.

59
00:05:50,518 --> 00:05:55,731
- I advise you to drop the case.
- I can't do that.

60
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:59,068
You have much work to do, Agent Mulder.

61
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:03,489
Don't jeopardise the future
of your own efforts.

62
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:25,636
You OK, Mulder?

63
00:06:27,263 --> 00:06:30,391
Yeah, I'm fine.

64
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:56,292
<i>(telephone)</i>

65
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,172
Hello.

66
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:05,968
<i>(Scully) Mulder.
I checked on that file you gave me.</i>

67
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:08,929
<i>- You failed to tell me a few things.
- (clicking)</i>

68
00:07:09,013 --> 00:07:12,808
<i>This isn't some UFO goose chase
you're leading me on, is it?</i>

69
00:07:13,601 --> 00:07:15,686
<i>- Are you there, Mulder?
- Yeah.</i>

70
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:19,815
<i>The Bureau has it out for us already.</i>

71
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:24,737
<i>It would make us appear stupid if
my field report read like a tabloid story.</i>

72
00:07:26,363 --> 00:07:28,907
I don't wanna talk about it on this line.

73
00:07:28,991 --> 00:07:32,161
I'll talk to you about it on the flight out, OK?

74
00:07:46,842 --> 00:07:48,927
<i>(jet roars overhead)</i>

75
00:07:52,514 --> 00:07:53,557
Hello?

76
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:56,060
- Mrs Budahas?
- Yes.

77
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:58,062
We're from the FBI.

78
00:07:58,145 --> 00:08:00,564
Oh, yes. Please, come in.

79
00:08:03,859 --> 00:08:07,112
I started noticing it about two years ago.

80
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:09,990
Bob developed this rash under his arms.

81
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:12,284
We'd been doing some renovations

82
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:15,704
so we thought it was a reaction
to the paint stripper.

83
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:18,374
But then everything just went crazy.

84
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:20,417
<i>(Scully)</i> How do you mean?

85
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:23,921
Bob's whole personality...
It was so unpredictable.

86
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:26,090
He started... doing things.

87
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:30,594
- What kinds of things?
- It was embarrassing at first.

88
00:08:30,678 --> 00:08:33,806
We were having this dinner party once
and, um...

89
00:08:33,889 --> 00:08:36,517
...he sprinkled Tetra Meal D over his food.

90
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,437
That's fish food flakes.

91
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:47,861
- Have you talked to him about this?
- I tried. It was extremely difficult.

92
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:50,030
Bob would get so angry.

93
00:08:50,114 --> 00:08:52,366
He'd yell at the kids for no reason

94
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:56,370
and then he would shake
like he was having a seizure.

95
00:08:56,870 --> 00:09:00,582
- Did he ever talk about his work?
- It was never discussed.

96
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,668
Even before the problems.

97
00:09:02,751 --> 00:09:06,588
I knew he worked on top-secret projects.
Word gets around.

98
00:09:06,672 --> 00:09:09,466
Bob was always a patriot first.

99
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:13,887
He took loyalty to his country as an oath...

100
00:09:13,971 --> 00:09:17,391
...and now they treat us like strangers.

101
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:23,105
I just want my husband back.

102
00:09:23,188 --> 00:09:26,275
The government is not above the law.

103
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:29,153
They cannot withhold information.

104
00:09:29,236 --> 00:09:31,864
And then I think, what if he's...

105
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:36,410
How would I support the family?

106
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:39,455
You said "word gets around".

107
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:43,208
Have you ever heard of this
happening to anyone else?

108
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:50,716
Yeah, Verla McLennen's husband.
He went kinda crazy.

109
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:54,803
But it's not like he didn't get to come home.

110
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:07,775
- How long has he been...
- Almost two years.

111
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:14,323
The fly-fishing idea was his brother Hank's.
I was upset at first.

112
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:17,451
But when you're the wife of a test pilot,

113
00:10:17,534 --> 00:10:20,287
you thank God
just to have them home alive.

114
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:25,667
Mrs McLennen, has anyone ever offered
to explain what caused this?

115
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:27,836
Stress, I guess.

116
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:33,091
You have to understand. The military
deals with things in a certain way.

117
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:38,722
They've given him plenty of therapy
and treatment and I'm thankful for that.

118
00:10:38,806 --> 00:10:43,560
They've taken good care of us.
And they do volunteer for their jobs.

119
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:49,608
<i>(Whispers)</i> Really, Anita,
bringing the FBI to my house.

120
00:10:56,824 --> 00:11:00,410
I've called all the numbers
a thousand times.

121
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:02,037
Let me know what you find out.

122
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:07,209
We'll be staying at the Beach Grove Motel
if you need anything, OK?

123
00:11:09,461 --> 00:11:12,047
What did you make of Uncle Fester?

124
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:16,844
It's called stereotypy.
It's a syndrome produced by extreme stress.

125
00:11:16,927 --> 00:11:20,973
POWs have suffered from it.
They've studied it in 200 animals.

126
00:11:21,056 --> 00:11:23,392
Yeah, but these guys are test pilots.

127
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:26,395
They're not supposed to fold
under pressure.

128
00:11:26,478 --> 00:11:29,273
Ever hear of the Aurora Project?

129
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:34,862
That's the unacknowledged code name for
a Defense Department surveillance project.

130
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:36,905
The Pentagon has admitted
they've been testing

131
00:11:36,989 --> 00:11:40,701
a secret class of sub-orbital spy craft.

132
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:45,497
Maybe these guys are flying those planes.
Maybe they're washouts.

133
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:50,752
You saw the photos in there. Budahas
received a presidential commendation.

134
00:11:50,836 --> 00:11:53,922
He's never washed out
of anything in his life.

135
00:11:59,052 --> 00:12:03,140
I've been on hold with the base
for 45 minutes. How about you?

136
00:12:03,223 --> 00:12:08,729
Yeah, somebody named Colonel Kissel
will meet with us... a week from Friday.

137
00:12:08,812 --> 00:12:10,898
Yeah, right!

138
00:12:14,610 --> 00:12:16,236
Did you say Kissel?

139
00:12:32,127 --> 00:12:34,254
- Colonel Kissel?
- Yes.

140
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:37,382
Can I talk with you?
Special Agent Mulder, FBI.

141
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:41,219
I've got nothing to say.
This is an invasion of my privacy!

142
00:12:41,303 --> 00:12:45,766
- Talk to us about Colonel Budahas.
- Get the hell out of my yard!

143
00:12:51,605 --> 00:12:54,775
- Good thing we kept that appointment.
- <i>(man)</i> Hi!

144
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,069
Are you the FBI agents?

145
00:12:57,152 --> 00:13:02,366
Paul Mosinger. I work for the local paper.
We live near Verla McLennen.

146
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:05,327
She said you're investigating Budahas.

147
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,496
We're just looking around.

148
00:13:07,579 --> 00:13:12,793
I got you. A lot of people out here
are just looking around. UFO nuts, mostly.

149
00:13:12,876 --> 00:13:17,005
- But it's not every day we get FBI.
- (jet overhead)

150
00:13:19,383 --> 00:13:22,427
By the time you hear them
they're already gone.

151
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:24,972
So, about Budahas. Getting anywhere?

152
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:27,307
We're not at liberty to comment.

153
00:13:27,391 --> 00:13:29,559
Well...

154
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:32,229
Paul, right?

155
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:35,607
You've lived in this area a while.
You ever seen a UFO?

156
00:13:35,691 --> 00:13:41,154
Never. Bunch of hooey, if you ask me.
People see what they wanna see.

157
00:13:41,238 --> 00:13:44,658
But if I wanted to talk
to one of those UFO nuts...

158
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,868
...where would I go?

159
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,214
<i>(jet overhead)</i>

160
00:14:00,549 --> 00:14:02,634
<i>(glasses rattling)</i>

161
00:14:03,510 --> 00:14:05,887
F-15 Eagle, pulling about four Gs.

162
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:09,057
Those boys think they are such hotshots.

163
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:14,062
Get a few drinks in 'em, you'd think
it was them up there flapping their wings.

164
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:18,483
- Who's the photographer?
- Various and sundry.

165
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,822
- I took the one on the end there.
- You're kidding? Where?

166
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:26,783
Out on the back porch.

167
00:14:26,867 --> 00:14:31,246
Taking out the garbage,
and there it was, just hovering.

168
00:14:32,748 --> 00:14:35,333
Quiet, like a hummingbird.

169
00:14:35,417 --> 00:14:37,044
I thought it was gonna land
in the parking lot

170
00:14:37,127 --> 00:14:40,464
and I was gonna have to serve 'em lunch.

171
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:43,592
I'm selling limited-edition prints. 20 dollars.

172
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:46,386
Down to my last five if you're interested.

173
00:14:47,429 --> 00:14:48,847
Put it on my tab.

174
00:14:49,723 --> 00:14:51,475
<i>(Whispers)</i> Sucker.

175
00:14:51,558 --> 00:14:55,437
What would be the chances
of someone like me seeing a UFO?

176
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:56,938
Catch you outside.

177
00:15:03,612 --> 00:15:08,158
Do you wanna see something weird?
EIIens Air Base isn't even on my map.

178
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,910
I know. Let's go.

179
00:15:09,993 --> 00:15:11,787
You know?

180
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:15,999
- Where are we going?
- We got our own map. Sucker!

181
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:52,035
What do you honestly hope to see?

182
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:54,204
I don't know. Maybe nothing.

183
00:15:56,748 --> 00:16:01,378
Is this why we came out here, Mulder?
To look for UFOs?

184
00:16:03,505 --> 00:16:07,717
Yeah, this is gonna look real good
on my field report!

185
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:22,607
<i>(low rumbling)</i>

186
00:16:32,701 --> 00:16:34,411
<i>(screams)</i>

187
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:39,166
Scully, wake up!

188
00:16:39,291 --> 00:16:41,376
You gotta see this!

189
00:16:54,097 --> 00:16:55,557
What are they?

190
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,561
I don't know. Just keep watching.
It's unbelievable.

191
00:17:00,854 --> 00:17:05,066
<i>(Scully)</i> That's unreal.
I've never seen anything like it.

192
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:07,819
They've been doing that for half an hour.

193
00:17:08,862 --> 00:17:11,907
Aircraft can't manoeuvre like that.

194
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,575
What else could they be?

195
00:17:13,658 --> 00:17:15,202
I don't know.

196
00:17:15,285 --> 00:17:18,538
Lasers being shot from the ground,
reflecting up off the clouds.

197
00:17:24,836 --> 00:17:26,922
<i>(crashing, fizzing noise)</i>

198
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:31,760
Oh, my God!

199
00:17:32,219 --> 00:17:34,387
<i>(Mulder)</i> Here comes another one.

200
00:17:41,645 --> 00:17:44,898
<i>(Scully)</i> That's not a plane.
That's a helicopter.

201
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:53,823
- Hey!
- Let's get outta here!

202
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:14,594
- Don't shoot!
- Stay right there.

203
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:16,763
We didn't do anything.

204
00:18:24,437 --> 00:18:26,523
Come on!

205
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:40,662
<i>(boy giggles)</i>

206
00:18:40,745 --> 00:18:43,748
That was extreme.

207
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:47,002
- Let's go. You're coming with us.
- <i>(boy)</i> What?

208
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:55,593
So what <i>exactly</i>
were you guys doing in there?

209
00:18:56,845 --> 00:18:58,930
Well, we were... um...

210
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:08,606
- We kinda have this spot.
- You know, we kinda kick back...

211
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:11,568
...listen to some tunes
and watch the air show.

212
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:14,988
- Were you ever chased out before?
- No, first time.

213
00:19:15,071 --> 00:19:17,365
Our friend showed us a hole in the fence.

214
00:19:17,449 --> 00:19:20,327
One time they dropped these bombs. Whoa!

215
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:22,120
Yeah, it was kinda heavy.

216
00:19:23,163 --> 00:19:28,418
There's a place called the Yellow Base,
where they store all this stuff.

217
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:33,048
And my friend said
that there's land mines all around it.

218
00:19:39,137 --> 00:19:41,097
I've got a 20. Over.

219
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:45,727
<i>(radio) Roger, Red Bird. Assume fallback
position. We're opening the cage.</i>

220
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,354
Red Bird out.

221
00:19:47,437 --> 00:19:51,024
Sometimes they come in real low
and just put on the skitters.

222
00:19:51,107 --> 00:19:54,235
It's like <i>(howls)</i>
and then they just hang there

223
00:19:54,319 --> 00:19:56,363
and hover without making a sound.

224
00:19:56,446 --> 00:20:01,076
And you just think, you know,
who turned down the volume, right?

225
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:02,869
What do you think they are?

226
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:05,538
OK. Everybody thinks that they're UFOs.

227
00:20:05,622 --> 00:20:11,252
But I think it's some kind of Star Wars,
cybertech, newfangled hardware, right?

228
00:20:11,336 --> 00:20:15,757
They're probably rolling out
for Desert Storm II or something like that.

229
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,135
Cruise right over Saddam's house,
it'd be like...

230
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:25,725
Do they look anything like this?

231
00:20:27,185 --> 00:20:28,228
No.

232
00:20:29,437 --> 00:20:31,398
They look <i>exactly</i> like that.

233
00:20:33,316 --> 00:20:35,610
- Thanks.
- Later, dude.

234
00:20:47,414 --> 00:20:49,874
- What's that?
- Evidence.

235
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,586
<i>(rock guitar)</i>

236
00:20:55,338 --> 00:20:57,424
Kids today, huh?

237
00:20:57,507 --> 00:21:00,218
You believe it all, don't you?

238
00:21:00,301 --> 00:21:02,554
Why wouldn't I?

239
00:21:05,432 --> 00:21:08,268
Did you see their eyes?
If I were that stoned...

240
00:21:08,351 --> 00:21:11,104
Ooh, if you were that stoned what?

241
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:14,315
You could've shown him
a picture of a flying hamburger...

242
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:16,818
...and he would have said
that's what he saw.

243
00:21:16,901 --> 00:21:18,778
I wanna show you something.

244
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:27,120
This is a photo of a UFO that reportedly
crashed in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947.

245
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:31,124
Now I know you don't believe that story,
but hear me out.

246
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:34,377
EIIens Air Base,
the same base we're at right now...

247
00:21:34,461 --> 00:21:38,631
...the same base that doesn't appear
on your US government map...

248
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:42,677
...is supposedly where parts
from the wreckage were shipped.

249
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:48,099
Mulder, are you suggesting
that the military is flying UFOs?

250
00:21:48,183 --> 00:21:52,270
No, planes <i>built</i> using UFO technology.

251
00:22:00,278 --> 00:22:04,073
Mulder, come on.
You've got two blurry photos.

252
00:22:04,157 --> 00:22:07,243
One of them taken almost 50 years ago.

253
00:22:07,327 --> 00:22:11,164
And another one
you purchased today in a roadside diner.

254
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:15,627
- You're going out on a pretty big limb.
- Tell me there isn't a resemblance.

255
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:19,756
Tell me one good reason
why either of these photos is authentic.

256
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:23,426
You saw exactly what I saw in the sky
tonight. What do you think they were?

257
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:29,766
Just because I can't explain it, doesn't mean
I'm going to believe they were UFOs.

258
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:35,939
Unidentified Flying Objects.
I think that fits the description pretty well.

259
00:22:36,022 --> 00:22:39,442
- Tell me I'm crazy.
- Mulder, you're crazy.

260
00:22:41,486 --> 00:22:46,032
And it still doesn't explain to me
what happened to Colonel Budahas.

261
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:50,286
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

262
00:23:00,421 --> 00:23:03,216
You didn't come to raid my minibar,
did you?

263
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,635
- You ready for this?
- What?

264
00:23:05,718 --> 00:23:10,098
We got a message from Mrs Budahas.
Her husband came home last night.

265
00:23:24,529 --> 00:23:26,573
We got your message.

266
00:23:26,656 --> 00:23:29,701
Mrs Budahas, are you OK?

267
00:23:32,662 --> 00:23:34,747
Come inside.

268
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:39,127
<i>(Scully)</i> What <i>is it?</i>

269
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:41,296
What? What's wrong?

270
00:23:42,964 --> 00:23:45,341
That... is not my husband.

271
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:54,517
Honey, who are these people?

272
00:24:05,862 --> 00:24:10,366
That is not him. That is not my husband.
They've done something to him.

273
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:13,369
- What are you talking about?
- It's OK. Just relax.

274
00:24:13,453 --> 00:24:15,955
I'm Special Agent Mulder from the FBI.

275
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:19,834
We're investigating your disappearance.

276
00:24:19,917 --> 00:24:23,755
Can you explain your whereabouts
over the past four months?

277
00:24:26,049 --> 00:24:28,384
- I was in the hospital.
- Here? On base?

278
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:30,386
I think so.

279
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:33,014
Colonel Budahas, may I ask your birth date?

280
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:36,392
November 21st, 1948.

281
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,064
And the names of your kids?

282
00:24:41,147 --> 00:24:43,358
Josh and Leslie. They're right there.

283
00:24:46,235 --> 00:24:47,904
Yeah.

284
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,449
Green Bay fan.

285
00:24:51,532 --> 00:24:53,076
Yes, sir.

286
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:56,496
Bet you remember the Super Bowl of '68,
huh? Don Chandler...

287
00:24:56,579 --> 00:25:00,375
Kicked four field goals.
Lombardi's last game.

288
00:25:01,125 --> 00:25:04,587
- Why do I have to answer these questions?
- It's not him.

289
00:25:10,093 --> 00:25:13,429
Colonel Budahas,
you're a pilot, isn't that right?

290
00:25:13,513 --> 00:25:15,056
Yes, sir.

291
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:18,810
Bet you've flown just about everything
with two wings.

292
00:25:18,893 --> 00:25:24,190
I got this hotshot pilot friend who said he
could do an Immelmann at a sustained 8 Gs.

293
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:26,484
Is that possible?

294
00:25:36,327 --> 00:25:38,454
I-I don't...

295
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,125
I can't...

296
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,255
Anita?

297
00:25:48,589 --> 00:25:50,675
I can't remember!

298
00:25:51,843 --> 00:25:54,053
No!

299
00:26:00,393 --> 00:26:03,521
Mulder, would you explain to me
what's going on?

300
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:07,817
I think they rewired that man's brain.
Some kind of selective memory drain.

301
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,571
The brain doesn't work like that.
You can't just erase certain files.

302
00:26:11,654 --> 00:26:12,947
Then you explain it to me.

303
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:16,367
- There are types of amnesia...
- This is not amnesia!

304
00:26:16,451 --> 00:26:18,619
It's something far more deliberate
and insidious.

305
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:21,748
The science or medical technology

306
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:24,125
to do what you are suggesting
does not exist.

307
00:26:24,208 --> 00:26:28,254
Neither does the technology
to fly the aircraft we saw last night.

308
00:26:28,337 --> 00:26:32,008
They can do this. He should've known
the answer to the question.

309
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:34,594
It just wasn't in his head any more.

310
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:40,183
<i>(Scully)</i> Even if they could,
why would they do it?

311
00:26:40,266 --> 00:26:42,351
To control information.

312
00:26:42,435 --> 00:26:47,064
Maybe after his psychotic episode
Budahas became a security risk.

313
00:26:47,148 --> 00:26:51,235
It couldn't just be that he had a breakdown
with a concomitant memory lapse?

314
00:26:51,319 --> 00:26:54,280
No, I think men like Budahas are incapable...

315
00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:56,491
...of dealing with the stress
of flying the aircraft we saw.

316
00:26:56,574 --> 00:26:59,285
Of doing those manoeuvres.

317
00:26:59,368 --> 00:27:02,371
We're talking about a technology
so advanced...

318
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:06,375
...that it's taken almost 50 years
to make it work. UFO technology, Scully.

319
00:27:18,721 --> 00:27:20,181
- What the hell...
- Hold on!

320
00:27:31,692 --> 00:27:33,778
Please, step out of the car.

321
00:27:33,861 --> 00:27:38,032
Do you think if we ignore him he'll go away?

322
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:40,201
Please, step out of the car.

323
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:42,203
Guess not.

324
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,794
Special Agent Mulder, FBI.

325
00:27:49,877 --> 00:27:51,796
Federal agents.

326
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,402
Wanna tell me what this is about?

327
00:28:16,571 --> 00:28:18,114
National security.

328
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:21,909
Now get in your car.
You'll be escorted back to your motel.

329
00:28:21,993 --> 00:28:24,245
You'll leave town immediately...

330
00:28:24,328 --> 00:28:28,833
...or assume the consequences
of intense indiscretion.

331
00:28:32,837 --> 00:28:37,758
Nothing under Idaho plate 001356?
No plate registered under that number?

332
00:28:39,427 --> 00:28:42,013
<i>(sighs)</i> Thanks, Gail.

333
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:45,141
No,no,no.
I'm sure the other one's bogus, too.

334
00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:47,018
Bye.

335
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:52,523
So, who were those guys?

336
00:28:52,607 --> 00:28:57,403
I don't think it was those kids they were
chasing away from the base last night.

337
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,739
I think it was us.

338
00:28:59,822 --> 00:29:03,534
They knew we were coming
before we ever arrived.

339
00:29:03,618 --> 00:29:06,579
And they returned Colonel Budahas
as a decoy.

340
00:29:12,752 --> 00:29:16,297
- There's something I didn't tell you.
- Something else?

341
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:20,885
I was approached by a man in DC who
warned me to stay away from this case.

342
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:22,720
He didn't give me his name...

343
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:25,890
- ...and my phone was being tapped.
- What?!

344
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:29,977
Why would they go to all this trouble?
Out of a need for security?

345
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:32,688
Security of what?

346
00:29:38,235 --> 00:29:41,572
I think there's
a huge conspiracy here, Scully.

347
00:29:41,656 --> 00:29:45,660
I'm sure they've got a UFO here.
They'll do anything to keep it secret.

348
00:29:45,743 --> 00:29:49,997
Including sacrificing the minds of those
pilots. Because what if the secret got out?

349
00:29:50,081 --> 00:29:54,293
If... <i>if that</i> were true...

350
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:56,462
...it would be a national scandal.

351
00:29:56,545 --> 00:29:58,547
No, you're not thinking big enough.

352
00:29:58,631 --> 00:30:03,469
If it were true, it would be confirmation
of the existence of extraterrestrial life.

353
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:10,768
Did you ever stop to think that what we saw
was simply an experimental plane...

354
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:14,563
...like the Stealth bomber
or this Aurora Project?

355
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:19,610
Doesn't the government have a right
and a responsibility to protect its secrets?

356
00:30:19,694 --> 00:30:21,779
Yes, but at what cost?

357
00:30:21,862 --> 00:30:27,159
When does the human cost become too high
for the building of a better machine?

358
00:30:27,243 --> 00:30:30,371
These are questions
we have no business asking.

359
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:35,042
Our kidnap victim is no longer outstanding.

360
00:30:35,126 --> 00:30:38,754
Let's get out of here, Mulder,
while you still have a job.

361
00:30:43,050 --> 00:30:44,760
Aren't you even curious?

362
00:30:56,689 --> 00:31:02,069
I'm gonna shower.
I'll pack and then we'll get out of here.

363
00:31:14,582 --> 00:31:16,667
<i>(car door shuts)</i>

364
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:19,045
<i>(car starts)</i>

365
00:31:21,797 --> 00:31:24,508
Mulder! Where are you going?

366
00:31:36,353 --> 00:31:38,439
Right here.

367
00:31:41,442 --> 00:31:43,402
Hey, aren't you guys coming?

368
00:31:43,486 --> 00:31:46,781
No, we've only gone in at night.

369
00:31:47,698 --> 00:31:51,827
This spot where you watched the air show?
How far is it?

370
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:54,080
45 minutes?

371
00:31:54,163 --> 00:31:57,291
- Will I be able to find it?
- <i>(girl)</i> Just stay on the path.

372
00:31:57,416 --> 00:31:59,835
What about Yellow Base
where they hangar them?

373
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:03,297
Don't! Don't even. It's like... ten miles.

374
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:06,425
Nobody's ever...
nobody's ever been that far!

375
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:09,637
Hey, don't go past
the edge of the tall weeds.

376
00:32:12,348 --> 00:32:14,433
Oh, man!

377
00:32:14,517 --> 00:32:17,686
Did we tell him
about the land mines and junk?

378
00:32:18,646 --> 00:32:19,814
Hey!

379
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:16,722
<i>(voice) Go! Go!</i>

380
00:34:28,192 --> 00:34:29,235
No!

381
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:31,528
<i>(voice)</i> C'mon! Hold him!

382
00:34:32,238 --> 00:34:34,240
<i>(voice)</i> Oxygen!

383
00:34:34,323 --> 00:34:36,742
I'm trying to call Washington, DC...

384
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:39,787
...and I can't seem to get
a long-distance line.

385
00:34:40,329 --> 00:34:42,414
Hello? Hello?

386
00:34:48,837 --> 00:34:53,467
Excuse me, my phone's not working. Can I
use yours to make a credit card call, please?

387
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:55,636
Sure thing.

388
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,229
This one's not working either.

389
00:35:05,312 --> 00:35:10,276
Phones are undependable around here.
People say it's the military interference.

390
00:35:10,359 --> 00:35:13,487
But they say that about everything.

391
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,197
Thanks.

392
00:36:05,873 --> 00:36:09,460
Hi. I was just looking for you.

393
00:36:09,543 --> 00:36:13,088
I knocked but I saw the door was open.

394
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:17,968
- I was in the lobby trying to make a call.
- Phones down again?

395
00:36:19,261 --> 00:36:22,473
<i>(radio) Base to Red Bird.
Your position? Over.</i>

396
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:30,022
<i>Red Bird, do you copy?</i>

397
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,733
What are you doing?

398
00:36:35,694 --> 00:36:39,531
Excuse me. There's nothing in there.

399
00:36:56,090 --> 00:36:59,426
Get in the car! Hands on the car! Do it!

400
00:36:59,510 --> 00:37:03,472
- Put the gun down and we'll talk about it.
- I said hands against the car!

401
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:05,933
Who are you?

402
00:37:06,016 --> 00:37:09,895
You're a long way from home.
Nobody wants this to come to violence.

403
00:37:09,978 --> 00:37:13,607
- Where's Mulder?
- We took him to the base.

404
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,484
We waited for him.

405
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:19,113
Get on that walkie-talkie
and find out where Mulder is.

406
00:37:19,196 --> 00:37:20,572
I can't do that.

407
00:37:20,656 --> 00:37:24,368
You can. Or I'll have
every newspaper in America out here...

408
00:37:24,451 --> 00:37:27,287
...writing about your experimental aircraft!

409
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:31,166
<i>(voice)</i> Vitals?

410
00:37:34,503 --> 00:37:36,588
<i>(voice)</i> Respiration...

411
00:38:00,362 --> 00:38:02,990
There are other ways to go about this.

412
00:38:03,073 --> 00:38:07,202
Yeah, I've already seen
where you get with tears and a sad story.

413
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:28,974
<i>- (radio) Your package is arriving.
- Roger.</i>

414
00:38:29,683 --> 00:38:31,768
<i>(turns engine off)</i>

415
00:38:32,895 --> 00:38:35,981
- What are we doing?
- Waiting.

416
00:38:36,899 --> 00:38:39,026
I want the car running.

417
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:42,070
I said start the car!

418
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:44,490
<i>(turns engine on)</i>

419
00:38:44,573 --> 00:38:47,910
And put your hands on the wheel
where I can see them.

420
00:38:50,621 --> 00:38:54,583
You do anything stupid
and this situation could get big in a hurry.

421
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,960
Just keep telling yourself that.

422
00:38:57,044 --> 00:38:59,546
<i>- Intruder arriving.
- Copy.</i>

423
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:38,377
I want you to keep the car running
and step out of the car.

424
00:39:55,477 --> 00:39:57,354
Get in the car, Mulder.

425
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:01,358
Get in the car!

426
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:13,662
I just wanna say

427
00:40:13,745 --> 00:40:17,165
everything you've seen here
is equal to the protection we give it.

428
00:40:18,375 --> 00:40:21,086
It's you who have acted inappropriately.

429
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:57,331
You OK, Mulder?

430
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,043
I think so.

431
00:41:07,049 --> 00:41:09,468
Scully, I...

432
00:41:12,471 --> 00:41:13,513
What?

433
00:41:16,391 --> 00:41:18,477
How did I get here?

434
00:41:24,733 --> 00:41:26,860
- <i>(Mulder) Hi.</i>
- Hello.

435
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:29,905
We came by to see
how your husband was doing.

436
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:33,659
Oh, he's fine.
He's getting much better now.

437
00:41:34,826 --> 00:41:37,412
- Could we see him?
- Um...

438
00:41:37,496 --> 00:41:42,584
- Well, he's resting now.
- <i>(Colonel Budahas)</i> Who is it now?

439
00:41:43,543 --> 00:41:46,046
Thank you for your concern.

440
00:41:50,467 --> 00:41:52,969
They got to her, Scully.
They were here.

441
00:41:53,053 --> 00:41:57,307
- They must have threatened her and...
- That's enough, Mulder!

442
00:41:57,474 --> 00:42:00,310
We don't know anything!

443
00:42:01,061 --> 00:42:04,272
Anything more than when we got here.

444
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:08,402
And that's what I'm gonna write
in my field report.

445
00:42:09,903 --> 00:42:13,657
Let's get out of here, Mulder,
as fast as we can.

446
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:21,707
<i>(Scully) Colonel Budahas
was returned to his home...</i>

447
00:42:21,832 --> 00:42:26,837
<i>...though his own knowledge of his
disappearance is vague and inconclusive.</i>

448
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:31,091
<i>Agent Mulder's insistence
that Budahas may have been a test pilot...</i>

449
00:42:31,174 --> 00:42:36,096
<i>...on a top-secret project involving aircraft
using recovered UFO technology...</i>

450
00:42:36,179 --> 00:42:39,266
<i>...and may have suffered
stress-related trauma</i>

451
00:42:39,349 --> 00:42:42,436
<i>by flying these aircraft, is also inconclusive.</i>

452
00:42:42,561 --> 00:42:46,356
<i>Though this agent can corroborate
Agent Mulder's account...</i>

453
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:51,570
<i>...of two unidentified flying objects
in the northern sky over Eilens Air Base...</i>

454
00:42:51,653 --> 00:42:55,115
<i>...their exact nature or design
could not be determined.</i>

455
00:42:55,198 --> 00:43:01,455
<i>Barring further authorised inquiry,
this case - file #DF101364 - is closed.</i>

456
00:43:46,458 --> 00:43:48,543
Your lives may be in danger.

457
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:50,879
Why?

458
00:43:50,962 --> 00:43:54,216
You've seen things that weren't to be seen.

459
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:58,261
Care and discretion are now imperative.

460
00:43:58,345 --> 00:44:02,307
- I saw something...
- I can provide you with information...

461
00:44:02,390 --> 00:44:05,227
...but only if it's in my best interest.

462
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:06,895
What is your interest?

463
00:44:06,978 --> 00:44:08,730
The truth.

464
00:44:10,273 --> 00:44:12,150
I did see something.

465
00:44:13,527 --> 00:44:16,988
But it's gone. They took it from me.

466
00:44:17,906 --> 00:44:19,991
They erased it.

467
00:44:21,034 --> 00:44:23,119
You have to tell me what it was.

468
00:44:23,203 --> 00:44:25,497
A military UFO?

469
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:34,798
Mr Mulder...

470
00:44:34,881 --> 00:44:40,637
...why are those who believe in the existence
of extraterrestrial life on this earth...

471
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:44,683
...not dissuaded
by all the evidence to the contrary?

472
00:44:44,766 --> 00:44:46,351
Because”.

473
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:52,691
...all the evidence to the contrary
is not entirely dissuasive.

474
00:44:52,858 --> 00:44:54,943
Precisely.

475
00:44:57,195 --> 00:44:59,281
They're here, aren't they?

476
00:45:00,574 --> 00:45:04,536
Mr Mulder,
they've been here for a long, long time.

477
00:45:44,326 --> 00:45:45,327
