1
00:00:52,429 --> 00:00:53,639
God...

2
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,809
- What are you doing to Barnett?
- Excuse me?

3
00:00:57,935 --> 00:01:00,479
What are you doing to Johnny?

4
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,983
Go back to your ward. There's nothing
you can do for your friend now.

5
00:01:06,068 --> 00:01:08,153
- What?
- John Barnett is dead.

6
00:01:08,237 --> 00:01:10,906
No, I heard him screaming.

7
00:01:14,826 --> 00:01:16,662
I said John Barnett is dead.

8
00:01:16,787 --> 00:01:18,664
You understand?

9
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,003
Go on, Crandall. Get outta here.

10
00:01:26,672 --> 00:01:29,841
There's nothing more to see here.
You understand?

11
00:02:35,574 --> 00:02:38,660
I still don't get it.
What does this have to do with us?

12
00:02:38,744 --> 00:02:41,496
Robbing a jewellery store is a federal crime.

13
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,081
Thank you.

14
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:46,376
I don't know. I got a call from a guy
I worked with in Violent Crimes.

15
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:48,378
Said it was important.

16
00:02:54,885 --> 00:02:57,262
Reggie! Reggie!

17
00:02:57,346 --> 00:02:59,765
Mulder! I hate it when you do that.

18
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:02,684
This is Special Agent Scully. Reggie Purdue.

19
00:03:02,768 --> 00:03:05,103
- How are you?
- Fine. What happened here?

20
00:03:05,187 --> 00:03:10,359
Lone gunman took out a salesgirl
<i>after</i> she filled up a bag for him.

21
00:03:10,442 --> 00:03:12,110
You guys turn up anything?

22
00:03:13,612 --> 00:03:16,114
Not much, except...

23
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,699
...this.

24
00:03:17,783 --> 00:03:19,451
It's gonna blow your mind.

25
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:21,119
Why?

26
00:03:21,244 --> 00:03:26,416
I'm telling you, Mulder,
this is going to blow... your... mind.

27
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,797
- What is it?
- Wait... wait a second.

28
00:03:31,922 --> 00:03:35,050
- See why I called you?
- What about witness descriptions?

29
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:38,720
White male,
five-eleven to six feet, ski mask.

30
00:03:40,472 --> 00:03:43,809
- Damn it, Reggie. That's Barnett.
- Yeah, but it can't be.

31
00:03:45,644 --> 00:03:47,145
Who's Barnett?

32
00:03:51,149 --> 00:03:54,069
It was my first case at the Bureau.

33
00:03:54,152 --> 00:03:57,739
Barnett was doing armed jobs all over DC
and getting away with it.

34
00:03:57,823 --> 00:04:00,158
He killed seven people.

35
00:04:00,283 --> 00:04:03,161
There was this big task force.
Reggie was my ASAC.

36
00:04:03,245 --> 00:04:05,747
I was 28 years old.
Right out of the Academy.

37
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:10,001
I had this theory on the case.
Reggie thought I was full of it.

38
00:04:10,127 --> 00:04:11,586
I <i>was</i> full of it.

39
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,006
- What was the theory?
- That Barnett had an inside connection.

40
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:20,095
An employee at the armoured car company
was tipping him off. I was sort of right.

41
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:21,430
Sort of?

42
00:04:21,513 --> 00:04:25,600
Yeah, we planted bogus waybills with
the armoured car company to set a trap.

43
00:04:25,684 --> 00:04:29,771
But Barnett was way ahead of us.
That's when the notes started.

44
00:04:30,856 --> 00:04:33,525
"Fox can't guard the chicken coop."

45
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:35,694
Clever, huh?

46
00:04:35,777 --> 00:04:40,115
- So you never caught him?
- No, we did. We did, but not... uh...

47
00:04:40,198 --> 00:04:41,616
...not clean.

48
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:44,453
An agent died because I screwed up.

49
00:04:47,456 --> 00:04:49,541
And what happened to Barnett?

50
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:52,627
He avoided the death penalty
on a technicality...

51
00:04:52,711 --> 00:04:57,132
- ..but he went down for every job he did.
- 340 years.

52
00:04:57,215 --> 00:04:59,468
The judge promised me he'd die in prison.

53
00:04:59,551 --> 00:05:01,970
So you think he escaped?

54
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:06,057
No, that's just it.
He did die in prison, four years ago.

55
00:05:06,141 --> 00:05:08,226
You're sure?

56
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,979
I was paying attention.

57
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,902
This guy a friend of yours?

58
00:05:17,027 --> 00:05:20,655
Yeah, I play golf with him
every Sunday. What do you think?

59
00:05:20,739 --> 00:05:23,742
You just brought this in ten minutes ago.

60
00:05:23,825 --> 00:05:26,244
You're slipping, Henderson.

61
00:05:26,328 --> 00:05:30,999
Ten minutes may be enough time for <i>you.</i>
Course, I wouldn't know from experience.

62
00:05:31,082 --> 00:05:33,752
Yeah... Seriously, what do you think?

63
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:40,175
The ink is fresh,
the note was written in the last 48 hours.

64
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:43,261
Ballpoint, but you knew that.

65
00:05:43,345 --> 00:05:46,431
A right-hander. Let's see...

66
00:05:46,556 --> 00:05:49,851
Written by someone sitting down.
Now I'm just showing off.

67
00:05:49,935 --> 00:05:52,062
Yeah. Does it match Barnett?

68
00:05:53,605 --> 00:05:55,440
I'd say it's him.

69
00:05:55,565 --> 00:05:57,025
But you're not sure?

70
00:05:57,108 --> 00:05:58,944
95 per cent.

71
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:02,948
Writing's sloppy. Some of the ascenders
and descenders are heavier.

72
00:06:03,615 --> 00:06:07,118
Could it have been traced over
an <i>old</i> note of Barnett's?

73
00:06:07,202 --> 00:06:09,871
Could be, but it's a damn good job if it is.

74
00:06:10,622 --> 00:06:14,709
- Thanks, Henderson. I owe you one.
- Promises, promises.

75
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:21,716
There's Barnett.
We staked out an airport warehouse...

76
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,343
...but everything went to hell

77
00:06:23,426 --> 00:06:26,805
when Barnett took the driver
of the armoured truck hostage.

78
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:28,598
Where's Mulder?

79
00:06:29,266 --> 00:06:32,310
There, coming round back.
Barnett doesn't see him.

80
00:06:35,313 --> 00:06:38,608
- He's got a clear shot.
- Yeah. He should have taken it.

81
00:06:39,985 --> 00:06:41,653
But he couldn't.

82
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:44,322
No, no, not with the hostage so close.

83
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:48,618
Because it's not by the book.

84
00:06:49,494 --> 00:06:53,164
It would have saved one life, maybe two.

85
00:06:53,248 --> 00:06:56,668
Bastard Barnett just started blasting away.

86
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:02,007
So Mulder did shoot Barnett.

87
00:07:03,174 --> 00:07:08,013
Twice - in the shoulder and hand.
But not before Barnett killed the driver...

88
00:07:08,138 --> 00:07:10,682
...and Agent Steve Wallenberg.

89
00:07:10,807 --> 00:07:14,769
Mulder... never forgave himself for that.

90
00:07:14,853 --> 00:07:18,106
You should have heard his testimony
at Barnett's trial.

91
00:07:18,189 --> 00:07:21,359
Probably had a lot to do with
the sentence Barnett got.

92
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:26,031
I'll never forget Mulder
coming down from the witness stand...

93
00:07:26,156 --> 00:07:30,785
...and Barnett turning
and saying he'd get Mulder.

94
00:07:30,869 --> 00:07:36,541
To tell you the truth, I wish Mulder had
killed Barnett right there in the warehouse.

95
00:07:50,013 --> 00:07:54,643
- What did Henderson come up with?
- 95 per cent sure it's Barnett's handwriting.

96
00:07:54,726 --> 00:07:56,227
What's that?

97
00:07:56,311 --> 00:08:00,148
Federal Bureau of Prisons
sent me a copy of his death certificate.

98
00:08:00,231 --> 00:08:04,486
Barnett, John Irvine.
Cardiac arrest.

99
00:08:04,569 --> 00:08:07,656
September 16th 1989.

100
00:08:07,739 --> 00:08:12,077
- Then it must be a very clever copycat.
- The note was written in the last 48 hours.

101
00:08:12,202 --> 00:08:14,245
- Pull any prints?
- No prints.

102
00:08:14,371 --> 00:08:17,999
Barnett had time in prison
to plan this with someone on the outside.

103
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:22,504
- Revenge from the grave? A neat trick.
- He planned to get you, didn't he?

104
00:08:26,257 --> 00:08:28,760
I was just down talking to Agent Purdue.

105
00:08:29,678 --> 00:08:31,554
He show you the video tape?

106
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:38,436
- You did the right thing, Mulder.
- Did I?

107
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,022
Steve Wallenberg had a wife and two kids.

108
00:08:41,106 --> 00:08:43,692
One boy is an all-star
on his football team now.

109
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:48,196
I shoot two seconds earlier
and Wallenberg'd be here to see his kid play.

110
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:53,284
Instead, I got some dead man robbing
jewellery stores and sending me haikus.

111
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,038
Let's go!

112
00:08:57,622 --> 00:09:00,792
Go, go, go. Right in there!

113
00:09:03,628 --> 00:09:05,714
Very good!

114
00:09:06,381 --> 00:09:08,049
Way to go, Alec.

115
00:09:10,927 --> 00:09:12,804
Two! One! Hut!

116
00:10:22,207 --> 00:10:24,501
I'll get you, you son of a bitch!

117
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:57,492
I've been thinking about it, Mulder, and I
think somebody is messing with your head.

118
00:10:57,575 --> 00:11:01,746
- Barnett said he'd get me. You were there.
- I don't care what he said. He's dead.

119
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:04,415
- Apparently not.
- Aw, come on.

120
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:07,669
There are a lot of guys
who know that Barnett made the threat.

121
00:11:07,752 --> 00:11:09,587
It's Barnett, Reggie!

122
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:12,549
- How could you say that?
- I don't know. I just feel it.

123
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:26,938
All this talk around here about
Spooky Mulder, I never paid it much mind.

124
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:30,441
I figured it was just talk
about how paranoid you were an' all.

125
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:32,026
And now?

126
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:35,947
Remember the day you walked
into my office wet from Quantico?

127
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:40,451
You pissed me off just looking at you,
but then I saw how your mind worked.

128
00:11:40,535 --> 00:11:45,373
How you were always three jumps ahead.
It was scary, Mulder. Everybody said so.

129
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:49,627
- I've heard this story.
- Well, maybe you ought to hear it again!

130
00:11:49,711 --> 00:11:54,132
You let a lot of people down here
in the Bureau. They had big plans for you.

131
00:11:54,257 --> 00:11:57,886
A lot of people are saying that Spooky
Mulder has become an embarrassment.

132
00:11:57,969 --> 00:11:59,554
A liability.

133
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:03,141
What? Are you saying that
somebody from the Bureau's behind this?

134
00:12:03,266 --> 00:12:06,394
Maybe, maybe not.
Just always best to cover your ass.

135
00:12:10,648 --> 00:12:12,567
Sorry.

136
00:12:13,401 --> 00:12:15,069
This was just faxed.

137
00:12:15,153 --> 00:12:18,156
It's a copy of John Barnett's
last will and testament.

138
00:12:18,239 --> 00:12:20,325
No surviving relatives.

139
00:12:20,408 --> 00:12:24,162
Left what little he had to another prisoner,
a Joe Crandall...

140
00:12:24,287 --> 00:12:26,831
...and instructions to be cremated.

141
00:12:26,915 --> 00:12:29,667
His will was executed
six months after his death...

142
00:12:29,751 --> 00:12:34,255
...and this states that his ashes were spread
along the bank of the Delaware River...

143
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:37,842
...by an employee of the crematory
used by the prison.

144
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:40,303
Somebody's messing with your head.

145
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:43,598
Killing a salesclerk just to leave me a note?

146
00:12:43,681 --> 00:12:46,601
I'd say that's going a little out of your way.

147
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:54,692
He's older now.
He may have put on some weight.

148
00:12:54,776 --> 00:12:57,278
<i>- </i> How much older?
- Five years.

149
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:06,871
He could be wearing any kind of disguise.

150
00:13:22,887 --> 00:13:25,682
<i>Take us back to the day</i>
<i>in question.</i>

151
00:13:26,641 --> 00:13:31,646
Was it your impression, Agent Mulder, that
John Barnett took a perverse pleasure...

152
00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:33,231
...in his crimes?

153
00:13:33,314 --> 00:13:35,858
Didn't he send you notes to taunt you?

154
00:13:36,526 --> 00:13:39,404
Yes, I felt that he was daring us
to catch him.

155
00:13:39,529 --> 00:13:43,074
That he killed his victims
almost as if it were part of a game.

156
00:13:43,199 --> 00:13:46,160
Describe for the court,
if you would, Agent Mulder...

157
00:13:46,244 --> 00:13:49,414
...what happened
when you finally caught John Barnett.

158
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,335
We had a customs warehouse
at the airport staked out.

159
00:13:54,419 --> 00:13:58,256
We knew Barnett had someone
working for the armoured car transport...

160
00:13:58,381 --> 00:14:01,175
...tipping them off
about large cash shipments.

161
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:04,679
But we never figured
he'd be inside the vehicle when it arrived.

162
00:14:04,762 --> 00:14:08,516
That's how Barnett was able
to take the driver of the vehicle hostage.

163
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:13,354
In other words, John Barnett
used his own accomplice as a hostage?

164
00:14:13,438 --> 00:14:15,273
Yes, ma'am.

165
00:14:15,398 --> 00:14:17,442
And then what happened?

166
00:14:17,525 --> 00:14:22,864
We surrounded Barnett and we ordered him
to surrender his hostage and his weapon.

167
00:14:22,947 --> 00:14:26,367
And where were you at this time,
Agent Mulder?

168
00:14:27,785 --> 00:14:29,704
I was right behind Barnett.

169
00:14:29,787 --> 00:14:32,248
With a clear shot of the suspect?

170
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:35,460
Yes, ma'am.

171
00:14:36,294 --> 00:14:38,379
But you didn't fire. Why?

172
00:14:38,463 --> 00:14:41,674
No. It's against FBI regulations

173
00:14:41,758 --> 00:14:44,302
to unnecessarily endanger
the life of a hostage.

174
00:14:44,427 --> 00:14:48,056
And I thought that
with no means of escape...

175
00:14:48,139 --> 00:14:50,141
...Barnett would give up.

176
00:14:51,392 --> 00:14:53,478
But what happened instead?

177
00:14:55,146 --> 00:14:58,483
The suspect, uh... John Barnett...

178
00:14:59,484 --> 00:15:02,737
...fired his weapon point-blank
at his hostage...

179
00:15:03,404 --> 00:15:06,574
...and then he turned his gun on
Steve Wallenberg.

180
00:15:07,992 --> 00:15:10,119
Shot him in the face.

181
00:15:13,498 --> 00:15:15,625
Thank you, Agent Mulder.

182
00:15:16,292 --> 00:15:18,503
No further questions at this time.

183
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:22,757
He gunned him down just for spite.

184
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,759
Your Honour, we object!

185
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:28,012
This was a man
with a wife and two small children...

186
00:15:28,096 --> 00:15:32,016
...and you shot him without...
hesitation, without a conscience...

187
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:34,352
- ..or humanity!
- Your Honour, do something!

188
00:15:34,477 --> 00:15:37,855
Which is why you should die like an animal,
you son of a bitch!

189
00:15:37,939 --> 00:15:41,984
If you do not stop,
it will be contempt of court. Order!

190
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,865
If there's not order,
I will be forced to clear the courtroom!

191
00:15:47,949 --> 00:15:51,702
Your Honour,
this is inflammatory against the defendant.

192
00:15:51,786 --> 00:15:55,206
- I ask that it be stricken from the record.
<i>- </i> Duly noted.

193
00:15:55,289 --> 00:15:59,377
The jury will disregard
the witness's last statement.

194
00:16:04,215 --> 00:16:07,885
I'll... get... you.

195
00:16:20,231 --> 00:16:22,817
- I'll need print-outs of every variation.
- Right.

196
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:25,903
I just got off the phone with the prison.

197
00:16:25,987 --> 00:16:29,657
- What did they come up with?
- No, I called <i>them</i> on a hunch.

198
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:33,911
Barnett died of a heart attack.
Or so it says on his death certificate.

199
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:37,081
Well, I had them fax me
all of his medical records.

200
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:41,669
Barnett was admitted to the prison
infirmary for an infection in his right hand.

201
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:45,590
There isn't any indication or diagnosis
of coronary complications.

202
00:16:45,715 --> 00:16:50,261
In fact, on his physical six months earlier
he was given a clean bill of health.

203
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:55,433
Crandall, someone to see you.

204
00:16:57,602 --> 00:16:59,687
I don't get many visitors.

205
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:02,690
- You knew John Barnett?
- Yes, sir.

206
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:04,859
How well did you know him?

207
00:17:04,942 --> 00:17:07,528
Pretty well.

208
00:17:07,612 --> 00:17:12,700
He left you everything in his will. You must
have known him better than "pretty well".

209
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:17,622
I used to change his bandages
and we just got to... know each other.

210
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:21,792
Are you aware that Barnett died of
cardiac arrest in this facility in 1989?

211
00:17:21,918 --> 00:17:26,297
- Cardiac arrest! Where's it say that?
- On his death certificate.

212
00:17:28,883 --> 00:17:30,927
He ain't dead, is he?

213
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,804
Why do you say that?

214
00:17:33,888 --> 00:17:39,644
Last time I saw John Barnett
was right in that room over there.

215
00:17:39,727 --> 00:17:42,146
Doctor with a knife
took his bad hand clean off.

216
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:44,398
- What doctor?
- Was it Dr Ridley?

217
00:17:44,482 --> 00:17:46,984
Yeah, it was Dr Ridley. That's the one.

218
00:17:48,986 --> 00:17:52,323
He told me Johnny was dead, but...
I knew it was a lie.

219
00:17:52,448 --> 00:17:54,992
He put a knife up under my chin
just for asking.

220
00:17:55,076 --> 00:17:57,286
How could you tell Barnett wasn't dead?

221
00:18:00,581 --> 00:18:02,667
I saw him looking at me.

222
00:18:03,459 --> 00:18:05,503
I saw him blink.

223
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:10,174
I'll never forget those eyes.

224
00:18:18,641 --> 00:18:20,351
What are you gonna do?

225
00:18:20,476 --> 00:18:22,770
I know what I'm not gonna do.

226
00:18:22,853 --> 00:18:26,524
I'm not gonna wait for Barnett
to send me another valentine.

227
00:18:27,483 --> 00:18:29,527
You mean the ghost of John Barnett?

228
00:18:31,362 --> 00:18:33,990
I didn't know you believed in ghosts, Scully.

229
00:18:45,793 --> 00:18:47,461
Hello?

230
00:18:48,129 --> 00:18:49,797
Yeah, just a minute.

231
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,966
It's for you.

232
00:18:55,303 --> 00:18:56,554
Mulder.

233
00:18:58,055 --> 00:19:00,141
Fox Mulder.

234
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:02,810
- Barnett?
- I'll run a trace.

235
00:19:02,893 --> 00:19:05,479
<i>- You sound surprised.</i>
- You know, uh...

236
00:19:05,563 --> 00:19:07,565
Shouldn't I be?

237
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:10,901
<i>You know, it's illegal</i>
<i>to tape another's phone call...</i>

238
00:19:11,402 --> 00:19:13,821
...without their express permission.

239
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,990
Isn't that what they call it?

240
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:17,992
In some states.

241
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:20,244
What makes you think I'm taping you?

242
00:19:20,328 --> 00:19:23,164
<i>Same thing makes me think</i>
<i>you're tracing this call.</i>

243
00:19:23,247 --> 00:19:24,999
What state are you in?

244
00:19:25,082 --> 00:19:27,209
Same state you are!

245
00:19:29,754 --> 00:19:33,257
I stood next to you in line
for coffee this morning.

246
00:19:34,008 --> 00:19:35,843
I don't think so.

247
00:19:39,013 --> 00:19:42,058
Man, I'm everywhere you are.

248
00:19:42,767 --> 00:19:44,894
Everywhere.

249
00:19:45,353 --> 00:19:47,438
I own you.

250
00:19:47,521 --> 00:19:49,440
How do I know it's really you?

251
00:19:49,523 --> 00:19:52,943
What did I say to you in the courtroom?

252
00:19:55,196 --> 00:19:57,281
Did you ever doubt me?

253
00:19:57,365 --> 00:19:59,450
I don't know. What <i>did</i> you tell me?

254
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:06,791
Huh! If you think you're gonna keep me
on this phone with this... clumsy act...

255
00:20:06,874 --> 00:20:09,627
Listen, by all accounts,
John Barnett is a dead man.

256
00:20:10,628 --> 00:20:13,964
<i>Oh,</i>
<i>you're the dead man, Mulder!</i>

257
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:19,637
Fine. I just need confirmation
that you are who you say you are.

258
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:22,807
You want confirmation...

259
00:20:23,808 --> 00:20:25,893
...you got it.

260
00:20:30,815 --> 00:20:33,567
Barnett... You there?

261
00:20:37,238 --> 00:20:40,241
- You lost him?
- Yeah, he was hip to the trace.

262
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:41,992
Was it Barnett?

263
00:20:42,076 --> 00:20:46,163
John Barnett was from New Hampshire.
He had a slight accent.

264
00:20:46,247 --> 00:20:48,332
Listen to this.

265
00:20:51,585 --> 00:20:54,922
<i>Fine. I just need confirmation</i>
<i>that you are who you say you are.</i>

266
00:20:55,005 --> 00:20:58,259
<i>You want confirmation, you got it.</i>

267
00:21:02,263 --> 00:21:08,185
- What did he mean by that?
- I don't know, but that is... John Barnett.

268
00:21:08,269 --> 00:21:10,438
I'm sure of it.

269
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:26,120
- Yeah?
<i>- Reggie, it's Mulder.</i>

270
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:29,498
What do you want?
It's the middle of the night.

271
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,960
It's only 10.45, Reggie.

272
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:35,796
Yeah, well, I was sleeping.

273
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:39,049
<i>Listen, it doesn't look like</i>
<i>Barnett's dead after all.</i>

274
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:40,718
Now what?

275
00:21:40,843 --> 00:21:46,557
I got an inmate at the prison who swears he
saw Barnett alive the night they say he died.

276
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:49,643
Mulder...

277
00:21:49,727 --> 00:21:51,645
...go home.

278
00:21:51,729 --> 00:21:53,314
Get some rest.

279
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:56,150
Just one thing doesn't make sense to me.

280
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:57,651
What's that?

281
00:21:57,735 --> 00:22:01,572
<i>Agent Henderson said that</i>
<i>that note left at the jewellery store...</i>

282
00:22:01,655 --> 00:22:05,075
<i>- .. was written by a right-hander.</i>
- Yeah. So?

283
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:08,204
<i>This inmate swears he saw</i>
<i>Barnett's right hand amputated.</i>

284
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:10,498
Argh!

285
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:15,336
Reggie, are you there?

286
00:22:15,419 --> 00:22:17,087
Hey, Reggie!

287
00:22:17,213 --> 00:22:19,715
<i>Reggie, what's goin' on?</i>

288
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:22,176
<i>Are you there?</i>

289
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:24,428
<i>What the hell's goin' on, Reggie?</i>

290
00:22:26,013 --> 00:22:27,431
Reggie!

291
00:22:27,515 --> 00:22:29,350
What happened? Hey, Reggie!

292
00:22:29,433 --> 00:22:32,770
<i>Reggie! What's going on? Are you there?</i>

293
00:22:32,853 --> 00:22:35,731
<i>What the hell's goin' on, Reggie?</i>

294
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:45,533
I hope you brought your fine-tooth comb.
I want every piece of lint analysed.

295
00:22:45,616 --> 00:22:48,452
If nothing turns up, run it through again.

296
00:22:48,577 --> 00:22:50,204
Mulder.

297
00:22:50,287 --> 00:22:54,708
His wife died of cancer six years ago.
He never liked to talk about it.

298
00:22:54,792 --> 00:22:57,795
As long as I knew him,
he was working on a mystery novel.

299
00:22:57,878 --> 00:23:02,967
He promised to show me it, but he never
did. I think he was afraid I wouldn't like it.

300
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:07,137
I'm probably the only guy in the Bureau
he trusted enough to even ask.

301
00:23:08,556 --> 00:23:09,974
I'm sorry.

302
00:23:10,099 --> 00:23:14,228
I'm just thinking how different
things would have been if I'd shot Barnett.

303
00:23:14,311 --> 00:23:16,313
Mulder...

304
00:23:16,438 --> 00:23:19,400
...we're still not 100 per cent sure this is him.

305
00:23:37,418 --> 00:23:39,837
Fresh ink, slightly smeared.

306
00:23:41,839 --> 00:23:44,842
I hate to tell you,
and I'm not known to be wrong...

307
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:49,597
...but this note was most certainly written
by a right-handed person.

308
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:52,600
You see the pressure points
inside the pen grooves?

309
00:23:52,683 --> 00:23:54,810
It's a dead giveaway.

310
00:23:56,353 --> 00:24:01,609
Would you be able to tell if this was written
by somebody using a prosthetic hand?

311
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:04,445
Well, this fella -

312
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:08,699
...and I'm assuming from the cursive figures
that it is a male suspect -

313
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:12,202
...he has a fairly nice, fluid style.

314
00:24:12,328 --> 00:24:16,624
Judging from the pressure variations
in the connectors...

315
00:24:16,707 --> 00:24:21,795
...they would need good finger dexterity.
You won't get that with a prosthesis.

316
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:24,882
You think it's the same person
that wrote the first note?

317
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:26,800
Uh-huh.

318
00:24:26,884 --> 00:24:28,636
This the guy you think killed Agent Purdue?

319
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:29,803
Yeah.

320
00:24:29,887 --> 00:24:31,555
Know what occurred to me?

321
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:36,226
You never got any prints off those notes.

322
00:24:37,227 --> 00:24:43,150
If this guy was wearing a glove on his pen
hand, note wouldn't be smeared like it is.

323
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:44,902
For what it's worth.

324
00:24:48,989 --> 00:24:51,742
I was just trying to find you. Listen to this.

325
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:56,080
According to the AMA, Dr Ridley,
who signed Barnett's death certificate...

326
00:24:56,205 --> 00:24:59,917
...hasn't officially been a doctor since 1979.

327
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,921
- What do you mean?
- His membership wasn't renewed...

328
00:25:04,004 --> 00:25:08,175
...after Maryland State revoked his
medical license for research malpractice...

329
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:10,511
...and misuse of a government grant.

330
00:25:10,594 --> 00:25:14,598
- Where does it say that?
- The National Institute of Health's journal.

331
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:16,433
What kind of research?

332
00:25:16,517 --> 00:25:21,355
He was conducting experiments on children
afflicted with a disease called progeria.

333
00:25:21,438 --> 00:25:25,859
The patient, you see,
is an eight-year-old girl...

334
00:25:25,943 --> 00:25:29,113
...suffering from
the advanced stages of progeria.

335
00:25:29,238 --> 00:25:31,115
She looks about 90.

336
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:34,952
Only about 100 cases have ever been
reported, so the disease is rare.

337
00:25:36,036 --> 00:25:38,122
But fatal.

338
00:25:38,205 --> 00:25:41,375
Some patients make it to early adulthood.

339
00:25:41,458 --> 00:25:43,794
Others become terminal
aged seven or eight.

340
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:46,046
What's the cause of death?

341
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:50,217
Clinically it's cardiac or
cerebral vascular disease, but actually...

342
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:53,721
...these poor kids die of old age.

343
00:25:53,804 --> 00:25:56,056
Is that Dr Ridley?

344
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:59,059
Yes. In 1974.

345
00:25:59,143 --> 00:26:04,398
Joe Ridley thought that he could take
their accelerated ageing and slow it down.

346
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:08,318
Initially, some of his lab work
was promising,

347
00:26:08,402 --> 00:26:10,946
but then things got out of control.

348
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:13,824
He wanted to begin human trials.

349
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:15,617
Why wasn't he allowed to?

350
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,996
Because he hadn't met the criteria.

351
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:22,666
It was all too hypothetical, too dangerous!
I mean...

352
00:26:23,667 --> 00:26:26,754
I knew Joe Ridley.
He didn't care about those kids.

353
00:26:26,837 --> 00:26:30,257
He talked about them
as if they were laboratory animals.

354
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:34,428
This terrible disease, progeria -
he saw it as a wonderful opportunity.

355
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:39,850
He used those exact words with me once.
An "opportunity" to unlock all the secrets.

356
00:26:39,975 --> 00:26:44,188
When they refused to allow
the human trials, he became enraged.

357
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:47,608
Do you know what they called Joe Ridley
behind his back?

358
00:26:47,691 --> 00:26:51,653
- What?
- Dr Mengele.

359
00:26:56,033 --> 00:27:00,037
So how did Dr Ridley
eventually lose his medical license?

360
00:27:00,162 --> 00:27:02,873
He went ahead with
the human trials secretly...

361
00:27:02,998 --> 00:27:05,042
...on an outpatient basis.

362
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:09,546
When we learnt about it,
we terminated his grant...

363
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:12,716
...and filed charges
with the state medical boards.

364
00:27:13,884 --> 00:27:18,722
I'm afraid your colleague Dr Ridley
has dropped off the face of the earth.

365
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:23,644
Yeah, although it's rumoured he went
to South America to continue his work.

366
00:27:28,148 --> 00:27:31,735
- You don't just reverse ageing.
- Ridley's found a way.

367
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:35,989
He wanted human research subjects, right?
Prisoners like John Barnett.

368
00:27:36,073 --> 00:27:37,908
It's science fiction.

369
00:27:37,991 --> 00:27:42,162
What would you have said 20 years ago
about gene splicing? DNA fingerprinting?

370
00:27:42,246 --> 00:27:44,414
Cloning? Artificial intelligence?

371
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:46,583
Maybe the man's not in his late forties.

372
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:50,420
Maybe John Barnett
has found the perfect disguise: youth.

373
00:27:57,010 --> 00:28:01,390
I wanna age him backwards now.
Let's start with ten years.

374
00:28:02,432 --> 00:28:04,560
Now five years more.

375
00:28:05,227 --> 00:28:07,271
And add 20 pounds.

376
00:28:07,688 --> 00:28:09,773
A <i>healthy</i> 20 pounds.

377
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:21,785
<i>Ridley's notes from</i>
<i>the human trials at NIH...</i>

378
00:28:21,910 --> 00:28:27,374
<i>..indicate he didn't see ageing as inevitable,</i>
<i>but as an opportunistic disease.</i>

379
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:31,628
<i>A disease that could be prevented,</i>
<i>reversed even...</i>

380
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:35,215
<i>..by changing the chemical cues</i>
<i>that trigger certain genes.</i>

381
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:41,305
<i>However, there is no evidence whatsoever</i>
<i>that Ridley's work yielded any results...</i>

382
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:45,642
<i>..or that his theories,</i>
<i>all hope to the contrary, hold any validity.</i>

383
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:04,244
<i>According to scientific journals, projections</i>
<i>on this kind of genetic engineering...</i>

384
00:29:04,328 --> 00:29:07,331
<i>..are at best speculative and futuristic.</i>

385
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:50,559
Who is it?

386
00:30:51,768 --> 00:30:53,854
<i>Dr Joe Ridley.</i>

387
00:31:26,762 --> 00:31:31,058
If you're really Dr Joseph Ridley, where
have you been for the past five years?

388
00:31:32,267 --> 00:31:35,062
I originally continued my research
in Mexico...

389
00:31:35,145 --> 00:31:40,901
...but for the last three years I spent my time
in Central America. In Belize, to be exact.

390
00:31:42,319 --> 00:31:44,571
What about Barnett?

391
00:31:44,654 --> 00:31:48,742
He's the only patient left.
The only one who survived the experiments.

392
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:50,911
What about you?

393
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:53,080
My appearance is deceiving.

394
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:59,002
I have no more than a month to live as I am
dying from a rare cerebral vascular disease.

395
00:32:00,295 --> 00:32:02,756
The disease that kills kids with progeria?

396
00:32:02,839 --> 00:32:04,925
That's right.

397
00:32:05,008 --> 00:32:08,095
An unfortunate side effect of the treatment.

398
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:11,264
By using the genetic
components of progeria...

399
00:32:11,348 --> 00:32:16,019
...I was able to reverse the ageing process
in the same way the disease expedited it.

400
00:32:16,144 --> 00:32:21,358
At the same time, I and my patients
became susceptible to the same ailments...

401
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:25,028
...a child of six or eight would
if he had the disease.

402
00:32:25,153 --> 00:32:26,822
What about Barnett?

403
00:32:28,031 --> 00:32:29,699
John Barnett.

404
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:32,786
If I didn't so personally detest the man...

405
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:35,288
...I might call him my one triumph.

406
00:32:35,372 --> 00:32:37,290
Barnett's not dying?

407
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,128
Only his eyes - which, for some reason...

408
00:32:41,211 --> 00:32:43,880
...do not respond to the gene therapy.

409
00:32:43,964 --> 00:32:47,008
Otherwise,
John Barnett appears to be thriving.

410
00:32:47,717 --> 00:32:49,511
But how?

411
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:53,807
I varied Barnett's treatment.

412
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:58,979
Once I isolated the progeria receptors,
I stumbled on something quite unexpected.

413
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:01,815
These same genes
related to myelin production.

414
00:33:01,898 --> 00:33:04,860
The material that insulates
neurons in the body.

415
00:33:05,861 --> 00:33:07,320
Yes.

416
00:33:07,404 --> 00:33:09,823
Myelin is not present in the very young...

417
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:13,577
...and by reversing the effects of ageing
I found with Barnett...

418
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,496
...I was able to regulate
the production of myelin.

419
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:20,500
Myelin being the material
that prohibits you or I from, say...

420
00:33:20,584 --> 00:33:26,840
...regenerating a new hand
if we were to have ours... cut... off.

421
00:33:28,508 --> 00:33:31,219
You were able to grow
John Barnett a new hand?

422
00:33:32,596 --> 00:33:34,681
Not exactly.

423
00:33:35,182 --> 00:33:37,267
Not a human hand anyway.

424
00:33:37,934 --> 00:33:41,605
I could never get the cells
to divide or behave properly.

425
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:43,607
I-I'm afraid to ask.

426
00:33:45,525 --> 00:33:49,863
- What kind of hand did you grow?
- There'd been successful work in London.

427
00:33:49,946 --> 00:33:53,366
By taking samples
of what we call cell morphogens...

428
00:33:53,450 --> 00:33:58,205
...from an amputated salamander arm and
applying them to the back of the creature...

429
00:33:58,288 --> 00:34:02,042
...they could grow a new limb
on a different part of the body.

430
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:04,211
But only on salamanders.

431
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:07,255
- Until John Barnett?
- Yeah.

432
00:34:07,964 --> 00:34:11,551
- Unbelievable.
- My work has cost me dearly.

433
00:34:11,635 --> 00:34:15,055
I'm an outcast in the medical community.

434
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:20,060
I was called Dr Mengele, Dr Frankenstein,
but I didn't care.

435
00:34:20,143 --> 00:34:23,104
Because you knew that
if your theories panned out...

436
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:28,318
The man who owns the fountain of youth
controls the world.

437
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:33,073
When the AMA censured me, certain
sponsors came out of the woodwork.

438
00:34:33,156 --> 00:34:35,742
One of them was the US government.

439
00:34:35,825 --> 00:34:38,078
They financed your research?

440
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:40,413
You might be more surprised to learn

441
00:34:40,497 --> 00:34:44,167
how high up the ladder
this dirty little secret goes.

442
00:35:04,271 --> 00:35:08,191
I know why you've contacted me.
Listen and I'll explain.

443
00:35:08,316 --> 00:35:11,861
I am not proud of the way
in which this matter was handled...

444
00:35:11,987 --> 00:35:15,532
...but, like it or not,
John Barnett is a fact of life.

445
00:35:15,657 --> 00:35:19,786
I wish Agent Purdue were around
to appreciate the irony.

446
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:23,623
The government knew full well
that Barnett was in the country.

447
00:35:23,707 --> 00:35:28,044
You, of course, know
that Barnett stole all of Ridley's research.

448
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,630
What Ridley doesn't know

449
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:35,010
is our government is bargaining
with Barnett to buy it from him.

450
00:35:39,848 --> 00:35:41,516
What does he want?

451
00:35:43,351 --> 00:35:46,813
A lot of money, immunity, safe haven.

452
00:35:46,896 --> 00:35:49,566
- Will he get it?

453
00:35:50,358 --> 00:35:53,028
He holds all the cards.

454
00:35:54,529 --> 00:35:59,075
You're aware that this... freak of science
you're negotiating with is a murderer?

455
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:03,830
The information he has...

456
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:08,251
...could change the course of mankind.
Consider the options.

457
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:12,881
I will.

458
00:36:38,448 --> 00:36:41,451
<i>Hi, this is Dana Scully.</i>

459
00:36:41,576 --> 00:36:44,037
<i>Please leave a message after the tone.</i>

460
00:36:45,622 --> 00:36:48,124
<i>Retrieving messages.</i>

461
00:36:49,751 --> 00:36:54,714
<i>Hi, Dana. It's Mom. I just wanted to call</i>
<i>and say hi. Um, give me a call whenever.</i>

462
00:36:54,798 --> 00:36:56,466
<i>OK, hon. Bye-bye.</i>

463
00:36:56,591 --> 00:37:00,470
<i>Hi, Dana. It's Kathy. I hope</i>
<i>you'll still meet me before my cello recital.</i>

464
00:37:02,305 --> 00:37:03,556
What's that?

465
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:07,060
It's my private answering machine,
or at least it used to be.

466
00:37:07,143 --> 00:37:08,395
Meaning?

467
00:37:08,478 --> 00:37:13,733
This morning I heard someone dialling in my
private code and replaying my messages.

468
00:37:13,817 --> 00:37:17,153
Last night I could have sworn
someone was in my apartment...

469
00:37:17,278 --> 00:37:20,907
...but when Ridley knocked
I thought I'd mistaken the noise for him.

470
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:26,079
- Scully...
- I took this down to Prints before I came up.

471
00:37:26,162 --> 00:37:30,083
John Barnett's left index oblique
is on the underside of this unit.

472
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:33,420
Mulder.

473
00:37:39,008 --> 00:37:40,927
Barnett?

474
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,679
<i>Mmm...</i>

475
00:37:42,762 --> 00:37:45,807
<i>Your new friend - Ridley.</i>

476
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:51,187
Don't grow too fond of him.

477
00:37:54,691 --> 00:37:58,945
He's gonna die soon,
like the rest of your friends.

478
00:37:59,028 --> 00:38:00,989
The rest of my friends?

479
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:04,534
One by one.

480
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:07,370
You're not that smart.

481
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:15,211
Tell me, you're not gonna make me
prove it to you again, are you?

482
00:38:16,045 --> 00:38:20,842
Oh, well, no matter.
It'll be your turn soon enough.

483
00:38:22,177 --> 00:38:24,220
But you won't get that chance.

484
00:38:25,388 --> 00:38:27,474
Oh, no?

485
00:38:30,018 --> 00:38:32,061
Who's gonna stop me, huh?

486
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:36,232
Man! This is... this is the land of the free!

487
00:38:39,402 --> 00:38:41,738
Well, I'm just checking in.

488
00:38:43,364 --> 00:38:44,991
Bye...

489
00:38:45,074 --> 00:38:47,202
...for now.

490
00:38:51,498 --> 00:38:54,000
What does Barnett know
from your messages?

491
00:38:54,083 --> 00:38:59,589
Uh, that my mother called for no reason and
I'm meeting a friend before her cello recital.

492
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:02,342
Where's that?

493
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:07,514
We're working at a disadvantage

494
00:39:07,597 --> 00:39:10,266
because we don't know
exactly what Barnett looks like.

495
00:39:10,391 --> 00:39:13,186
Study each of these faces. Know them.

496
00:39:13,269 --> 00:39:17,273
- Particularly the eyes.
- I'm including a diagram of the theatre.

497
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:20,944
You have six front entrances
and four more backstage.

498
00:39:21,027 --> 00:39:26,032
If he shows he'll key on Scully, so wherever
she is, she should not leave your sight.

499
00:39:26,115 --> 00:39:28,034
We've got two hours
before the performance.

500
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:30,036
Know this place inside and out.

501
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:34,874
We don't want any shots fired, if we can
help it. We want to take Barnett alive.

502
00:39:34,958 --> 00:39:37,126
OK?

503
00:39:37,210 --> 00:39:39,045
How you feelin'?

504
00:39:39,128 --> 00:39:41,965
This is the first time
I've ever played the target.

505
00:39:42,048 --> 00:39:44,801
Well, let's make sure it's not the last time.

506
00:41:23,399 --> 00:41:24,484
Gun!

507
00:41:27,236 --> 00:41:28,236
Down!

508
00:41:35,578 --> 00:41:37,080
Check her out!

509
00:41:48,383 --> 00:41:51,511
Get back, Mulder! Shut up!

510
00:41:52,053 --> 00:41:54,597
Back off! Back off!

511
00:41:55,223 --> 00:41:57,100
Don't even think about it.

512
00:41:58,267 --> 00:42:00,395
Just let her go.

513
00:42:01,396 --> 00:42:03,272
Go ahead and shoot!

514
00:42:03,356 --> 00:42:06,609
Go ahead, man! Shoot, Mulder.

515
00:42:06,693 --> 00:42:08,778
What are you afraid of, huh?

516
00:42:08,861 --> 00:42:11,531
What? It's against regulations, huh?

517
00:42:11,614 --> 00:42:14,450
No, man, you need me alive, don't you?

518
00:42:14,534 --> 00:42:17,954
Cos I'm the only one
who knows where the research is, huh?

519
00:42:19,038 --> 00:42:21,124
So I could shoot <i>her...</i>

520
00:42:21,207 --> 00:42:23,876
...and you just have to live with it,
don't you, huh?

521
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,420
Shut up!

522
00:42:28,464 --> 00:42:30,591
How about it, Mulder?

523
00:42:31,384 --> 00:42:33,469
Just like old times, huh?

524
00:42:33,553 --> 00:42:34,971
Huh?

525
00:42:49,610 --> 00:42:51,904
- Call an ambulance!
- I'll do it!

526
00:42:51,988 --> 00:42:56,492
Hear me? It's OK, Scully.
An ambulance is on the way.

527
00:42:56,617 --> 00:42:59,120
Easy. You all right?

528
00:43:05,668 --> 00:43:07,754
Don't try to move.

529
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:15,678
Where are they?

530
00:43:15,803 --> 00:43:18,181
Can you hear me? Barnett?

531
00:43:18,264 --> 00:43:20,349
Where did you hide them?

532
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:27,857
- How you feeling?
- Like somebody kicked me in the ribs.

533
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:31,652
The bullet went through eight layers
of Kevlar. You're lucky to be alive.

534
00:43:34,113 --> 00:43:35,948
What about him?

535
00:43:36,032 --> 00:43:38,785
They flew in three specialists
to save his life.

536
00:43:38,868 --> 00:43:41,370
That guy in the ugly suit is probably CIA.

537
00:43:41,496 --> 00:43:43,873
He's been trying to talk to him.

538
00:43:43,998 --> 00:43:47,210
- Is Barnett conscious?
- Yeah, but he's not talking.

539
00:43:53,174 --> 00:43:56,552
Mulder, I know what you did
wasn't by the book.

540
00:43:56,677 --> 00:43:58,971
Tells you a lot about the book, doesn't it?

541
00:44:07,855 --> 00:44:10,399
Where is it? Barnett! Come on!

542
00:44:10,525 --> 00:44:12,485
Where are the papers?

543
00:44:14,403 --> 00:44:16,656
50 over palp. Vitals dropping.

544
00:44:16,739 --> 00:44:19,242
- OK, we're gonna have to hit him.
- Intubate.

545
00:44:19,325 --> 00:44:21,702
Come on! Come on! Shock him.

546
00:44:22,578 --> 00:44:24,705
Shock him now!

547
00:44:25,748 --> 00:44:27,834
Got no pulse, no rhythm.

548
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,588
They lost him.

549
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:37,510
Bastard'll take that research
with him to the grave.

550
00:44:38,928 --> 00:44:40,596
Where do you think it is?

551
00:44:43,683 --> 00:44:45,518
<i>Who knows?</i>

552
00:44:45,601 --> 00:44:49,188
<i>If Barnett didn't destroy it,</i>
<i>he could have stashed it anywhere.</i>

553
00:44:49,272 --> 00:44:51,607
<i>Which would have a certain cruel irony.</i>

554
00:44:51,691 --> 00:44:55,111
<i>Scientific knowledge</i>
<i>that could change the course of mankind...</i>

555
00:44:55,236 --> 00:44:59,782
<i>..buried out in a field somewhere,</i>
<i>or sitting in some safe deposit box...</i>

556
00:44:59,907 --> 00:45:02,201
<i>..getting old just like the rest of us.</i>

557
00:45:02,285 --> 00:45:07,540
<i>If he didn't destroy it, chances are</i>
<i>somehow, someday, somebody will find it.</i>

558
00:45:07,623 --> 00:45:12,211
<i>And when they do, maybe he didn't</i>
<i>get his revenge from beyond the grave...</i>

559
00:45:12,295 --> 00:45:16,465
<i>..but somehow I feel like we haven't heard</i>
<i>the last from John Barnett.</i>

560
00:45:49,916 --> 00:45:51,792
<i>I made this!</i>
