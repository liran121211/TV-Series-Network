1
00:00:03,881 --> 00:00:07,050
I'm here in Pasadena with
the NASA Mission Control team...

2
00:00:07,134 --> 00:00:09,761
...as they celebrate scientific history.

3
00:00:09,887 --> 00:00:12,639
The first close-up photographs of Mars...

4
00:00:12,723 --> 00:00:15,350
...from the Viking Observer spacecraft.

5
00:00:15,434 --> 00:00:17,728
Photos that have created a stir...

6
00:00:17,811 --> 00:00:21,064
...by revealing surprising
geologic information.

7
00:00:21,148 --> 00:00:25,444
The presence of large amounts of water
locked in Mars' polar ice caps.

8
00:00:25,527 --> 00:00:30,199
Water that some speculate could have
possibly sustained life on the planet.

9
00:00:30,616 --> 00:00:34,578
Even more controversial
is one image of a land formation.

10
00:00:34,661 --> 00:00:37,915
A formation that looks like
a sculpted human face.

11
00:00:37,998 --> 00:00:43,128
However, NASA officials are denying
it is an indication of an alien civilisation.

12
00:00:43,837 --> 00:00:48,050
It's no more than a trick of light and
shadows. A geologic anomaly.

13
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:51,094
The only sculptors at work
are the solar winds...

14
00:00:51,178 --> 00:00:55,474
...that blow across the surface of Mars
at 300mph, ten months a year.

15
00:01:32,094 --> 00:01:34,179
I'm seeing... I've got...

16
00:01:34,263 --> 00:01:36,348
<i>How's it going out there?</i>

17
00:01:36,431 --> 00:01:40,644
- There's something out here!
<i>- Can you repeat that, Commander Belt?</i>

18
00:01:40,727 --> 00:01:43,105
It's coming at me! Holy God!

19
00:03:03,477 --> 00:03:06,188
<i>Pickup terminal sequence.</i>

00:03:06,271 --> 00:03:09,107

<i>This is Shuttle Launch Control.</i>
<i>T minus one minute, 15 seconds.</i>

22
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:16,365
<i>- OTC to CDR, how do you read?</i>
<i>- Loud and clear, OVCC.</i>

23
00:03:19,117 --> 00:03:21,495

<i>- Copy setup. 2.0.</i>

24
00:03:21,578 --> 00:03:24,206
<i>CDR Houston, how do you read?</i>

25
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:25,707
Loud and clear.

26
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:29,086
<i>Side hatch closeout and</i>
<i>white room configuration complete.</i>

00:03:32,506 --> 00:03:36,259
<i>- OMS pressure on. Cabin vent complete.</i>
<i>- Roger. We see that.</i>

29
00:03:36,343 --> 00:03:39,679
<i>All systems go for APU start.</i>
<i>Transfer to internal power.</i>

30
00:03:39,805 --> 00:03:42,432
<i>Pre-start complete. APU to inhibit.</i>

31
00:03:42,516 --> 00:03:44,518
<i>Oxygen vent hood retracted.</i>

00:03:44,601 --> 00:03:46,395
<i>External tank is at flight pressure.</i>

33
00:03:46,645 --> 00:03:49,523
<i>Lock your visors and initiate your O2 flow.</i>

34
00:03:49,648 --> 00:03:52,984
<i>- Y'all have a good trip.</i>
<i>- Roger that.</i>

35
00:03:53,568 --> 00:03:55,654
<i>T minus 20 seconds and counting.</i>

36
00:03:56,905 --> 00:03:58,990
<i>Go for auto-sequence start.</i>

37
00:03:59,074 --> 00:04:01,326
<i>Booster hydraulic units have started.</i>

38
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:05,247
<i>T minus 10...</i>

00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,415

<i>Three...</i>

46
00:04:13,505 --> 00:04:16,007
<i>- Abort liftoff. Abort liftoff.</i>

47
00:04:16,133 --> 00:04:17,926
<i>System failure. Abort.</i>

48
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:21,638
<i>Repeat. We have an abort liftoff</i>
<i>at T minus three seconds.</i>

49
00:04:24,683 --> 00:04:26,768
What did the note say?

50
00:04:27,853 --> 00:04:32,023
That they worked for NASA and wanted
to talk to somebody from the FBI.

51
00:04:33,859 --> 00:04:37,112
- Why the cloak-and-dagger routine?
- I have no idea.

52
00:04:37,195 --> 00:04:40,699
- Think it's a crank?
- It's beginning to look that way.

53
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:56,923
- My name is Michelle Generoo.
- Fox Mulder.

54
00:04:57,048 --> 00:04:59,092
I sent you the note.

55
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:01,052
Hi. Special Agent Dana Scully.

56
00:05:01,136 --> 00:05:06,349
I'm sorry to have to take these precautions.
I flew up from Houston this morning.

57
00:05:06,433 --> 00:05:09,728
- I work at the Space Center there.
- In what capacity?

58
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:13,940
I'm the Mission Control communications
commander for the Space Program.

59
00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:15,734
What brings you to Washington?

60
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:19,404
I have reason to believe
a saboteur may be at work inside NASA.

61
00:05:19,488 --> 00:05:23,283
- You have evidence of sabotage?
- I don't know. I may.

62
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:28,872
Two weeks ago, a shuttle mission was
scrubbed three seconds before liftoff...

63
00:05:28,955 --> 00:05:32,417
...when an auxiliary power unit
valve malfunctioned.

64
00:05:32,501 --> 00:05:34,920
If the flight had not been aborted...

65
00:05:35,003 --> 00:05:38,673
...the orbiter would have exploded
on the launch pad.

66
00:05:38,757 --> 00:05:41,468
This was sent to me in the mail.

67
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:46,014
It's a material analysis that shows

68
00:05:46,097 --> 00:05:49,518
deep grooved scoring marks
inside this APU valve.

69
00:05:49,601 --> 00:05:53,104
Marks that could have
caused a malfunction.

70
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:56,942
- Evidence of tampering?
- That's what it looks like but...

71
00:05:57,067 --> 00:06:02,781
The person who gave me your names said
you are experts in unexplained phenomena.

72
00:06:02,864 --> 00:06:06,201
It's unexplainable how and when
anybody could've done it.

73
00:06:06,284 --> 00:06:09,871
- How do you mean?
- The valve is made of ferrocarbon titanium.

74
00:06:09,955 --> 00:06:14,042
To score it would take extreme
temperatures. Launch pad temperatures.

75
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,044
Anyone at NASA would say...

76
00:06:16,127 --> 00:06:20,882
...it would be impossible for anyone
to do that type of damage undetected.

77
00:06:20,966 --> 00:06:24,135
- Any idea who may have sent that to you?
- No. No idea.

78
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:29,057
But the official analysis of the malfunction
was simple mechanical failure.

79
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:33,895
- Does anybody share your suspicions?
- If they do, they're not talking to the FBI.

80
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:36,398
I believe in the Space Program.

81
00:06:36,481 --> 00:06:41,570
I believe in the people who run it. But
there's another launch window tomorrow.

82
00:06:41,653 --> 00:06:44,406
And my reasons may sound selfish...

83
00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:48,618
...but my fiancé is the shuttle commander
on that mission.

84
00:06:52,998 --> 00:06:56,585
Why would somebody
sabotage the space shuttle?

85
00:06:56,668 --> 00:07:01,840
If you're a terrorist, it's a potent symbol
of American progress and prosperity.

86
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:06,261
If you're an opponent of big science,
NASA represents a vast money trench...

87
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:10,348
...that exists outside
the crucible of the democratic process.

88
00:07:10,432 --> 00:07:14,436
Then there are futurists who think
the shuttle is a rusty old bucket

89
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:16,104
that we should mothball.

90
00:07:16,187 --> 00:07:21,776
A dinosaur spacecraft built in the '70s
by scientists setting their sights on space.

91
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:25,196
And we thought we'd rest easy
when the Soviet Union fell.

92
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,702
Not to mention fringe elements who accuse
our government itself of space sabotage.

93
00:07:30,827 --> 00:07:34,956
The failure of the Hubble telescope
and the Mars Observer connected...

94
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,376
- ..to a conspiracy to deny us evidence.
- Evidence of what?

95
00:07:39,336 --> 00:07:41,379
Alien civilisations.

96
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:42,964
Oh, of course!

97
00:07:51,556 --> 00:07:54,768
- Wow, look at that! Gemini Eight.
- What?

98
00:07:54,893 --> 00:07:58,647
The man we're gonna see, Colonel Marcus
Aurelius Belt, nearly died on that mission.

99
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,483
Made an emergency landing
in the Pacific Ocean.

100
00:08:01,566 --> 00:08:05,111
- You remember all that stuff?
- You never wanted to be an astronaut?

101
00:08:05,195 --> 00:08:07,280
I guess I missed that phase.

102
00:08:10,033 --> 00:08:12,077
<i>Come in.</i>

103
00:08:13,745 --> 00:08:16,748
Colonel Belt, I'm Special Agent Dana Scully.

104
00:08:16,831 --> 00:08:20,418
- And this is...
- Colonel Belt. Fox Mulder.

105
00:08:21,586 --> 00:08:24,339
I'm a big fan. It's an honour to meet you.

106
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:26,800
You were a big hero to me when I was a kid.

107
00:08:26,883 --> 00:08:27,967
Thank you.

108
00:08:28,051 --> 00:08:31,763
I... I stayed up all night when I was 14
to watch your space walk.

109
00:08:31,846 --> 00:08:35,725
Well, now it's like
a stroll around the block.

110
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:39,896
So, how can I help you?

111
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:43,942
This found its way to the FBI.

112
00:08:44,859 --> 00:08:46,945
Do you recognise it?

113
00:08:50,615 --> 00:08:53,034
Sure. It's an auxiliary power unit valve.

114
00:08:53,118 --> 00:08:56,204
Do you have any reason
to believe it was damaged...

115
00:08:56,287 --> 00:08:59,290
...in an effort to sabotage
the Space Program?

116
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,584
No.

117
00:09:01,668 --> 00:09:05,922
- Do you have reason to suspect it at all?
- No reason whatsoever.

118
00:09:06,005 --> 00:09:08,258
If you have any respect for this program

119
00:09:08,341 --> 00:09:11,553
and for those who have devoted
their lives to it...

120
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:15,140
...you'll be careful
to whom you make those accusations.

121
00:09:15,265 --> 00:09:17,517
Looking at this evidence, sir...

122
00:09:17,642 --> 00:09:21,229
...would you consider
postponing the shuttle flight...

123
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:24,649
...until a full investigation can be conducted?

124
00:09:24,774 --> 00:09:28,445
I don't know where you got
this specious artefact...

125
00:09:28,528 --> 00:09:32,157
...but every precaution has been taken
to rectify the problem.

126
00:09:32,282 --> 00:09:36,035
We've waited two weeks for a window
to initiate this mission.

127
00:09:36,161 --> 00:09:38,121
We've got a payload to deliver.

128
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:41,958
Has an internal investigation
been done in this matter?

129
00:09:42,041 --> 00:09:46,337
The part you have here has been installed,
inspected and designed...

130
00:09:46,463 --> 00:09:49,215
...by over 100 highly trained technicians.

131
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:53,595
With the security measures we take,
it would be virtually impossible...

132
00:09:53,678 --> 00:09:57,265
...for one man working by himself,
or two or four men...

133
00:09:57,348 --> 00:09:59,934
...to do what you're suggesting.

134
00:10:00,018 --> 00:10:03,062
I can assure you,
there's no one in this facility...

135
00:10:03,188 --> 00:10:07,025
...that doesn't want to see that shuttle
complete its mission...

136
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:09,736
...and come back like Winged Victory herself.

137
00:10:09,861 --> 00:10:12,989
And in about ten hours, God willing...

138
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:14,783
...you're gonna see just that.

139
00:10:14,866 --> 00:10:20,121
Do you think there'd be a problem with us
watching liftoff from Mission Control?

140
00:10:20,205 --> 00:10:25,251
Well, being that you'd probably go over
my head anyway, please, be my guests.

141
00:10:25,376 --> 00:10:27,420
It was an honour, sir.

142
00:10:28,505 --> 00:10:30,381
Thank you.

143
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:36,679
Didn't you wanna get his autograph?

144
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:41,851
Where did you say you got this?

145
00:10:41,935 --> 00:10:44,270
It came to us anonymously.

146
00:10:44,395 --> 00:10:48,066
This is an APU valve, all right.
But this doesn't make sense.

147
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,027
- What doesn't make sense?
- This scoring here.

148
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,822
This valve was made of
ferrocarbon titanium.

149
00:10:53,905 --> 00:10:57,659
- You didn't order the analysis?
- No. I've never seen this before.

150
00:10:57,742 --> 00:11:01,037
We're on outside contract to NASA.
They may have ordered it.

151
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,083
But wouldn't you order
a material analysis if a part malfunctioned?

152
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:08,127
Every shuttle flies
with that same APU valve.

153
00:11:08,253 --> 00:11:12,131
To do an analysis and redesign
would delay the Program for months.

154
00:11:12,257 --> 00:11:13,842
Not to mention the cost.

155
00:11:13,925 --> 00:11:17,428
Is it conceivable that
the Program is being pushed ahead...

156
00:11:17,554 --> 00:11:19,764
...without proper safety precaution?

157
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:23,893
There are about 17,000 things
that can go wrong with the shuttle.

158
00:11:23,977 --> 00:11:27,146
And about 17,000 people
who make sure they don't.

159
00:11:27,272 --> 00:11:30,733
Who makes
the final determination as to its safety?

160
00:11:30,817 --> 00:11:34,445
We make a recommendation
but the decision is Colonel Belt's.

161
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,948
Thank you.

162
00:11:41,828 --> 00:11:43,454
What do you think?

163
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:46,916
I can't believe
how much faith we put in machines.

164
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:52,005
Do you think Colonel Belt
lied about his knowledge of a saboteur?

165
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:57,427
I can't believe Colonel Belt would
endanger the lives of those astronauts.

166
00:11:57,510 --> 00:12:00,305
He was an astronaut himself.

167
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,849
So you think this x-ray is bogus?

168
00:12:04,017 --> 00:12:06,519
God, I hope so.

203
00:14:07,098 --> 00:14:09,183
Roger that. Ten-four.

204
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:30,788
I have to admit I've fulfilled
one of my boyhood fantasies.

205
00:14:30,913 --> 00:14:34,625
Yeah, it ranks up there with
learning how to braid my own hair.

206
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:37,962
Come on, Scully,
you have to admit that was exciting.

207
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:41,466
- Mission Control, the countdown...
- Mulder! Wait!

208
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:44,635
- Something's gone wrong.
- What happened?

209
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:46,804
Something's wrong with the shuttle.

210
00:14:46,888 --> 00:14:49,557
We had trouble with the rocket boosters,
but fixed it.

211
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,810
We changed watch. I went home
to try to get some sleep.

212
00:14:52,935 --> 00:14:55,813
I got a call. Communication
with the shuttle is down.

213
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:58,232
We've got to get back to Houston.

214
00:15:08,493 --> 00:15:12,663
There's a press blackout. Chances are
the media doesn't know about it.

215
00:15:12,747 --> 00:15:16,834
- You think this is sabotage?
- I don't know. Things go wrong all the time.

216
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:20,171
- Yeah, but they usually fix them, right?
- Usually.

217
00:15:20,296 --> 00:15:21,422
She's turning.

218
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,959
Michelle!

219
00:15:58,042 --> 00:16:00,294
- I can see her.
<i>- </i> Michelle!

220
00:16:00,378 --> 00:16:02,505
- Help!
- Are you all right?

221
00:16:03,798 --> 00:16:06,384
- Oh, I'm stuck!
<i>- </i> Can you move?

222
00:16:07,385 --> 00:16:10,012
Just get me out of here! I'm wedged in!

223
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:13,975
- Are you all right?
- I'm wedged in!

224
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:17,145
Come here. Can you push with your legs?

225
00:16:17,228 --> 00:16:19,647
- Be careful.
- Just get me out of here!

226
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:22,900
OK! All right! Come on.

227
00:16:36,998 --> 00:16:39,083
Don't try to move.

228
00:16:40,585 --> 00:16:43,087
I've got to get back to Houston.

229
00:16:45,715 --> 00:16:47,925
- What happened?
- I don't know.

230
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:50,094
Something came at me in the fog.

231
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:54,765
The next thing I knew, I was upside down.

232
00:16:54,891 --> 00:16:57,101
- Was it some kind of an animal?
- No.

233
00:16:57,185 --> 00:17:00,605
It had a face. It was...

234
00:17:00,688 --> 00:17:03,107
It was grotesque.

235
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:05,860
I don't know what it was.

236
00:17:18,623 --> 00:17:21,042
Orbiter, this is Houston. Do you copy?

237
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,211
<i>Your transmission is breaking up.</i>

238
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:28,716
What's happening?

239
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,385
We have a malf
in the OMS and RCF systems.

240
00:17:31,469 --> 00:17:34,555
They can't get the orbiter
into attitude rotation.

241
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:38,809
Temperature in the cabin is 103
and they have transmission problems.

242
00:17:38,893 --> 00:17:42,563
- What happened?
- I had an accident. What's their position?

243
00:17:42,647 --> 00:17:46,901
- Just over Eastern Africa.
- Try the Seychelles tracking station.

244
00:17:51,072 --> 00:17:53,658
Hang in there, OTC.

245
00:17:53,783 --> 00:17:56,160
The orbiter manoeuvring system is down.

246
00:17:56,285 --> 00:18:01,082
They can't rotate the shuttle to keep it away
from the sun and keep the orbiter cool.

247
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:04,335
Drop in cabin pressure.
21 kilopascals and declining.

248
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:07,004
They're gonna burn up.

249
00:18:07,129 --> 00:18:09,090
- Where's Colonel Belt?
- On his way.

250
00:18:09,757 --> 00:18:12,510
- Damn! What happened to backup?
- Failed to respond.

251
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:15,846
What about telemetry?
Can we auto-activate from here?

252
00:18:15,972 --> 00:18:19,183
We cannot auto-activate.
It's like someone's interfering.

253
00:18:19,308 --> 00:18:22,853
- Screwing communications from this end.
- Can you trace it?

254
00:18:22,979 --> 00:18:27,692
- It'd have to be a digital processor.
- They'd have to be in the data banks.

255
00:18:27,775 --> 00:18:30,361
- Where's that?
- Come on.

256
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:16,324
Mulder?

257
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:20,995
I'm a federal agent!

258
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:22,872
Come on out of there!

259
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:27,460
- What are you doing in here?
- I work here.

260
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:28,836
Let me see your clearance.

261
00:19:28,919 --> 00:19:32,006
A sensor went off. There was a malfunction.

262
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:34,175
- Did you find it?
- No.

263
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:37,178
Did you see anybody else in here?

264
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:40,431
OK, call Security.
I want a search of the premises.

265
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:44,143
No-one is to come in or out
of this building without proper clearance.

266
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:48,105
<i>- I'm breaking up, OTC.</i>
- What's the attitude of the orbiter?

267
00:19:48,189 --> 00:19:50,608
Flying tail first, belly towards the sun.

268
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:53,986
The flash evaporator system is working
but not enough to cool 'em down.

269
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:57,740
- Cabin temperature 116.
<i>- </i> Where's...

270
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,451
Somebody's jamming our transmissions.

271
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:05,498
Interfering with our ground communications
and scrambling our uplink telemetry.

272
00:20:05,623 --> 00:20:08,918
The shuttle is not responding
to override signals.

273
00:20:09,001 --> 00:20:11,962
I'm gonna let 'em fly by wire.

274
00:20:12,046 --> 00:20:15,216
- I'm cutting off telemetry.
- It might not work.

275
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:18,344
- We have to give it a chance.
- We have to bring them down.

276
00:20:18,469 --> 00:20:20,137
We have to give them control of the ship

277
00:20:20,221 --> 00:20:23,557
to perform that rotation
and deliver the payload.

278
00:20:23,641 --> 00:20:26,644
What if they can't?
We could be stranding them.

279
00:20:35,361 --> 00:20:38,030
Abandon telemetry. Go to fly-by-wire mode.

280
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:44,829
They're cutting off ground control.
The astronauts will be flying the shuttle.

281
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:46,831
Is it gonna work?

282
00:20:50,334 --> 00:20:52,420
OTC, this is Houston.

283
00:20:52,503 --> 00:20:54,588
How's the weather up there?

284
00:20:54,672 --> 00:20:57,633
<i>Sunny and warm, Houston.</i>
<i>What's the forecast?</i>

285
00:20:57,716 --> 00:21:00,219
OTC, we're going to fly-by-wire mode.

286
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:04,932
We're going to abort ground control to see
if you can bring those systems back up.

287
00:21:05,891 --> 00:21:07,935
<i>Roger that, Houston.</i>

288
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:10,104
<i>And leave the driving to us.</i>

289
00:21:10,187 --> 00:21:12,481
David...

290
00:21:12,565 --> 00:21:14,650
You take care.

291
00:21:20,865 --> 00:21:22,950
What just happened?

292
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:25,411
They cut off contact with the shuttle.

293
00:21:29,415 --> 00:21:34,128
Negative.
We pulled off the MPG. We're on manual.

294
00:21:41,177 --> 00:21:43,846
45 seconds.

295
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:49,685
If they were able to execute,
they'd have done it by now.

296
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:52,438
Standing by.

297
00:21:55,816 --> 00:21:57,902
60 seconds.

298
00:22:01,322 --> 00:22:04,116
Go to re-establish uplink communication.

299
00:22:12,208 --> 00:22:13,876
Video signal's failed.

300
00:22:14,543 --> 00:22:16,712
OTC, this is Houston. Do you copy?

301
00:22:23,511 --> 00:22:26,055
OTC, this is Houston. Where are you?

302
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:29,600
<i>Howdy do, Houston?</i>

303
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:32,603
<i>Looks like we finally got</i>
<i>this bird to fly right.</i>

304
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:42,905
- OTC, do you hear that?
<i>- Music to our ears.</i>

305
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:48,077
Cabin temperature stabilising.

306
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:51,372
OTC, this is Marc Belt in Houston.

307
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:53,374
How's the crew holding up?

308
00:22:53,457 --> 00:22:55,543
<i>They're looking good, sir.</i>

309
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:58,128
You all get some rest.

310
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:00,297
We'll get back to work...

311
00:23:00,381 --> 00:23:02,925
- ..at about 0700.
<i>- Roger that, Houston.</i>

312
00:23:03,008 --> 00:23:05,886
Let's get to work
on that telemetry problem.

313
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:09,306
We've got a big day ahead of us.

314
00:23:26,991 --> 00:23:29,410
<i>Let's just let the electronic press...</i>

315
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:31,662
...get their sound equipment set.

316
00:23:38,335 --> 00:23:41,422
I know you have a lot of questions.
I'll get to them.

317
00:23:41,505 --> 00:23:44,425
How did he know what he did
was going to work?

318
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:49,138
He didn't. They could have died up there
and there's nothing we could have done.

319
00:23:49,221 --> 00:23:51,724
They'd have been a ghost ship stuck in orbit.

320
00:23:53,392 --> 00:23:55,477
Why would he take that risk?

321
00:23:55,561 --> 00:23:59,523
Bring those men back
without delivering that payload?

322
00:23:59,607 --> 00:24:02,484
You're talking millions of wasted dollars.

323
00:24:02,568 --> 00:24:05,821
That's all Congress would need
to shut down NASA.

324
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,657
As of 2200 hours...

325
00:24:08,741 --> 00:24:12,328
...the crew has been conducting
on-board tests and tasks...

326
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:16,665
...and resting up for their first
full day in space tomorrow.

327
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:21,086
I'm happy to say,
after a beautiful night launch...

328
00:24:22,046 --> 00:24:25,257
...the shuttle orbiter
has performed... magnificently.

329
00:24:33,849 --> 00:24:35,934
So much for your boyhood hero.

330
00:24:44,735 --> 00:24:46,820
Colonel Belt?

331
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:49,698
Colonel Belt?
Can I talk to you for a moment?

332
00:24:52,076 --> 00:24:54,244
You want to know why I lied to them.

333
00:24:54,328 --> 00:24:56,830
You're asking yourself if I'd lie to you.

334
00:25:00,959 --> 00:25:04,922
You know what it means
to be an astronaut, sir?

335
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:08,759
You risk your life every time
you get into your spacecraft.

336
00:25:08,842 --> 00:25:11,970
For nothing more than
the good progress of mankind.

337
00:25:12,054 --> 00:25:14,264
You've got no argument from me, sir.

338
00:25:14,348 --> 00:25:16,850
- You're true American heroes.
- Heroes?

339
00:25:16,934 --> 00:25:20,062
We used to make headlines
when we did our job right.

340
00:25:20,145 --> 00:25:22,564
Now they bury you in the back of the paper.

341
00:25:22,648 --> 00:25:25,484
Name two astronauts
in the last shuttle mission.

342
00:25:27,069 --> 00:25:30,155
You make the front page today
only if you screw up.

343
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:32,116
They only know your name...

344
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:36,328
...if you're the unlucky s.o.b.
sitting on 500 tons of dynamite.

345
00:25:36,412 --> 00:25:39,039
That's what they're really waiting for.

346
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:42,126
Sir, I have to ask.

347
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:44,586
I'm sorry. It's my job.

348
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:48,006
Do you think someone
is sabotaging the shuttle?

349
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:52,845
My answer to you, sir, will be to
bring those men back safely to Earth.

350
00:27:07,336 --> 00:27:10,255
- I've got...
<i>- How's it going out there?</i>

351
00:27:10,339 --> 00:27:14,510
- There's something out here!
<i>- Can you repeat that, Commander Belt?</i>

352
00:27:14,593 --> 00:27:16,678
It's coming at me! Holy God!

353
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:20,534
<i>Houston, we just heard something weird.</i>

354
00:28:21,869 --> 00:28:24,121
OTC, Houston. Can you describe it?

355
00:28:24,204 --> 00:28:28,333
<i>Uh, sort of a dull thump like...</i>
<i>something bumped the ship!</i>

356
00:28:28,417 --> 00:28:30,586
<i>Have you got any ideas about that?</i>

357
00:28:30,669 --> 00:28:32,963
<i>There it is again!</i>

358
00:28:38,176 --> 00:28:40,137
We're taking a look at it now.

359
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:42,848
That one right there.

360
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:48,562
They've got an oxygen leak
on board the orbiter.

361
00:28:49,646 --> 00:28:52,858
<i>Our O2 gauges</i>
<i>are going all screwy, Houston.</i>

362
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:58,280
We got problems.
An O2 leak in the main tank.

363
00:28:58,363 --> 00:29:00,198
What did they say happened?

364
00:29:00,282 --> 00:29:02,409
They don't know. They said it was a thump.

365
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:03,660
Stand by.

366
00:29:04,036 --> 00:29:09,458
An astronomer in Winnipeg just spotted a
mile-long gaseous cloud trailing in our orbit.

367
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:11,793
The liquid O2 leaking out into space.

368
00:29:11,877 --> 00:29:15,005
Exactly what happened
to Colonel Belt on an Apollo mission.

369
00:29:15,088 --> 00:29:16,590
How much time do they have?

370
00:29:16,673 --> 00:29:21,386
Hard to say without accurate telemetry
data. We're doing a guesstimate.

371
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:24,473
- Where is Colonel Belt?
- He was due 90 minutes ago...

372
00:29:24,556 --> 00:29:26,850
...to begin payload deployment.

373
00:29:26,975 --> 00:29:29,436
<i>Uh, Houston, we're up here wondering...</i>

374
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,607
<i>- .. when do we start holding our breath?</i>
- We're working on it, OTC.

375
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:36,860
I need those calculations
and a worst-case scenario.

376
00:29:36,985 --> 00:29:39,529
We don't know
if both O2 tanks are damaged.

377
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:41,782
Worst-case scenario!

378
00:29:41,865 --> 00:29:44,701
- And someone find Colonel Belt!
- We'll find him.

379
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:48,038
They've got 30 minutes of oxygen.
Then it's anybody's guess.

380
00:29:49,831 --> 00:29:51,333
Why does she need Belt?

381
00:29:51,416 --> 00:29:53,502
She doesn't know how serious the leak is.

382
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:56,964
Even I can figure out what happens
when you run out of oxygen.

383
00:29:57,255 --> 00:30:01,426
Colonel Belt's been in the same situation.
He'll know what to do.

384
00:30:01,551 --> 00:30:03,595
Where the hell is he?

385
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:15,148
Colonel Belt!

386
00:30:18,443 --> 00:30:20,570
Colonel Belt!

387
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:23,740
I'm gonna go get Security.

388
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:27,077
Colonel Belt.

389
00:30:29,579 --> 00:30:31,248
Are you all right?

390
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,085
Yeah, I wasn't feeling well.

391
00:30:35,168 --> 00:30:37,212
They need you at Mission Control.

392
00:30:37,295 --> 00:30:39,840
There's been another accident.

393
00:30:39,923 --> 00:30:44,177
OTC, is your orbital
manoeuvring system still operational?

394
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:48,265
<i>Roger, Houston. We're ready for re-entry.</i>
<i>Just say the word.</i>

395
00:30:48,348 --> 00:30:50,434
How bad's the leak?

396
00:30:52,019 --> 00:30:54,604
We have no way to determine.

397
00:30:55,647 --> 00:30:57,733
OTC.

398
00:30:57,816 --> 00:31:00,861
What's the condensation in your cabin?

399
00:31:00,944 --> 00:31:02,988
<i>The windows are getting steamy.</i>

400
00:31:03,113 --> 00:31:04,990
Carbon dioxide build-up.

401
00:31:05,115 --> 00:31:07,159
OK, OTC.

402
00:31:07,284 --> 00:31:09,327
Everything's gonna be fine.

403
00:31:09,453 --> 00:31:11,663
I want you to get in your spacesuits...

404
00:31:11,788 --> 00:31:13,832
...and depressurise your cabin.

405
00:31:13,957 --> 00:31:17,377
And then I want you to... vent that CO2.

406
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:20,881
<i>- Roger, Houston. Then what?</i>
- I want you to stay in your suits.

407
00:31:20,964 --> 00:31:25,552
And then I want you to prepare
to use your emergency oxygen systems.

408
00:31:25,635 --> 00:31:27,471
And then I want you to...

409
00:31:29,556 --> 00:31:32,893
...to... deliver your payload.

410
00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:37,022
Those are men up there.

411
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:44,905
You're out of line. You wanna tell me how
to do my job? I've been in that situation.

412
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:49,576
There's more at risk than your personal life.
If you can't accept that...

413
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:53,497
...or operate effectively
in these circumstances...

414
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:57,667
...you'd better leave the decisions
to people in this room who can!

415
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:11,056
OTC...

416
00:32:11,181 --> 00:32:13,225
...do you copy?

417
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:16,728
<i>Roger, Houston. We're waiting on</i>
<i>those O2 calculations.</i>

418
00:32:24,778 --> 00:32:26,863
Michelle!

419
00:32:28,115 --> 00:32:30,826
- They're gonna die!
- You don't know that.

420
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:35,539
It's unconscionable putting that payload
before those men's lives!

421
00:32:35,622 --> 00:32:39,835
I think she's right, Mulder.
You saw him in there. He's losing it.

422
00:32:39,918 --> 00:32:43,296
- He saved their lives earlier.
- Or put them in unnecessary jeopardy.

423
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:47,217
If he can't deliver that payload,
Congress will kill the Space Program.

424
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,469
So will killing the astronauts.

425
00:32:49,553 --> 00:32:52,264
Somebody must have
sabotaged the shuttle.

426
00:32:52,347 --> 00:32:54,057
Too many things have gone wrong.

427
00:32:54,141 --> 00:32:58,228
- I think Colonel Belt knows about it.
- We've got to stop him.

428
00:32:58,687 --> 00:33:01,857
- Pull them out of orbit!
- He doesn't want them to die.

429
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:04,526
- How do you know?
- I know it. I'm sure of it.

430
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:08,363
- He put them up there!
- And only he can get them down alive.

431
00:33:08,446 --> 00:33:13,118
How can you be certain that what he's doing
isn't gonna save their lives?

432
00:33:13,201 --> 00:33:16,163
Now, I need access
to your records, in a hurry.

433
00:33:17,664 --> 00:33:21,459
Everything on
the Hubble Telescope, Mars Observer...

434
00:33:21,543 --> 00:33:23,628
...and the current orbiter mission.

435
00:33:23,712 --> 00:33:25,797
Tens of thousands of documents.

436
00:33:25,881 --> 00:33:29,551
- What are we looking for?
- X-rays, diagrams, schematics.

437
00:33:29,634 --> 00:33:34,014
- Proof that Belt knew about a sabotage.
<i>- </i> A needle in a haystack.

438
00:33:52,908 --> 00:33:56,077
<i>Payload deployment initiated.</i>

439
00:33:57,621 --> 00:34:00,957
<i>Roger that, OTC. Tracking it now.</i>

440
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,419
<i>Looks good from here.</i>

441
00:34:10,508 --> 00:34:12,510
<i>Payload delivery is complete, Houston.</i>

442
00:34:12,594 --> 00:34:14,679
<i>We're awaiting your order.</i>

443
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:19,267
System check for re-entry de-orbit burn.

444
00:34:20,227 --> 00:34:23,980
<i>Holy God! There's something</i>
<i>outside the ship that...</i>

445
00:34:24,064 --> 00:34:27,984
<i>- There's someone outside the ship!</i>
<i>- </i> Can you repeat that, OTC?

446
00:34:28,068 --> 00:34:30,153
<i>There's... some kind of...</i>

447
00:34:30,237 --> 00:34:32,739
<i>..ghost outside the ship!</i>

448
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:34,783
No... No...

449
00:34:37,702 --> 00:34:39,621
No... No!

450
00:34:39,704 --> 00:34:43,416
No! No-o-o-o-o!

451
00:34:48,171 --> 00:34:50,840
Mulder? I found it.

452
00:34:50,924 --> 00:34:54,177
This is the same diagram
that was sent to Michelle.

453
00:34:56,346 --> 00:35:00,767
Ordered by Colonel Belt. Which means
he knew about the faulty valve.

454
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:06,022
This is from the Challenger. It's the O-ring
fitting that failed, dated January 21, 1986.

455
00:35:06,147 --> 00:35:08,608
One week before the space shuttle blew up.

456
00:35:08,692 --> 00:35:11,194
The analysis was ordered by Colonel Belt.

457
00:35:11,319 --> 00:35:14,614
So he might have known
about the Challenger defect?

458
00:35:14,698 --> 00:35:17,951
Something weird is going on here, Scully.

459
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:21,121
Colonel Belt's collapsed. He's in his office.

460
00:35:25,166 --> 00:35:27,210
He was just here!

461
00:35:31,214 --> 00:35:33,300
Oh, my God.

462
00:35:33,383 --> 00:35:35,635
What's wrong with him?

463
00:35:38,054 --> 00:35:40,223
Get a doctor.

464
00:35:47,856 --> 00:35:49,899
Help me!

465
00:35:51,026 --> 00:35:53,570
- Help me!
- How can we help you, Colonel?

466
00:35:53,653 --> 00:35:55,238
He's having some kind of a seizure.

467
00:35:55,322 --> 00:35:56,823
Come on! Come on, come on!

468
00:35:56,906 --> 00:36:01,328
No... They're... tearing me apart!

469
00:36:02,495 --> 00:36:04,581
Let me see if I can get a pulse.

470
00:36:07,459 --> 00:36:09,836
Oh... Help me!

471
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:13,298
- I'm bringing that shuttle down.
- No-o-o-o!

472
00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:16,134
- It's out there!
- Come on, let's put him down.

473
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:21,264
- Spacesuit...
- Easy, easy.

474
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:24,768
- Strap him down!
- Give him 10mg of diazepam!

475
00:36:24,851 --> 00:36:27,062
- No!
- He's gonna hurt himself!

476
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:29,481
He's trying to tell us something!
Colonel Belt?

477
00:36:29,564 --> 00:36:35,070
- Those men are running out of oxygen.
- They don't have to die.

478
00:36:35,153 --> 00:36:39,032
Colonel Belt, I want you to focus.
Focus your breathing.

479
00:36:39,115 --> 00:36:42,160
Focus your pain... right here.

480
00:36:44,704 --> 00:36:47,874
Blood pressure's 174 over 120.
Vitals are rising.

481
00:36:47,957 --> 00:36:50,627
- Mulder, you're risking an aneurysm.
- Focus!

482
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,840
Now you're focused.

483
00:36:55,965 --> 00:36:57,801
Right here.

484
00:36:57,884 --> 00:37:02,305
Now you're gonna save those astronauts
and you're gonna tell me how to do it.

485
00:37:04,724 --> 00:37:08,561
The shuttle... can't survive re-entry.

486
00:37:08,645 --> 00:37:11,398
- He's lying.
- How do you know it can't survive?

487
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:15,527
The fuselage... the fuselage is damaged.

488
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:19,489
- The silicone tiles are destroyed.
- How does he know?

489
00:37:19,572 --> 00:37:22,909
- How has it been damaged?
- I'm responsible.

490
00:37:22,992 --> 00:37:27,914
- Did you sabotage the shuttle?
- No, but I couldn't stop them.

491
00:37:27,997 --> 00:37:31,167
Nobody could stop them!

492
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:33,294
- Stop who?
- Pulse is 194.

493
00:37:33,378 --> 00:37:35,547
- You'll kill him, Mulder!
- Stop who?

494
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,674
They don't want us to know!

495
00:37:37,757 --> 00:37:40,218
- They don't want us to know!
- Who?!

496
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:44,556
It came to me. It lives in me!

497
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:51,062
It's coming at me! It's coming at me!

498
00:38:00,822 --> 00:38:05,410
No! Help me! It's coming back!

499
00:38:16,087 --> 00:38:18,840
That's the face I saw in the fog!

500
00:38:18,923 --> 00:38:21,009
- We're losing him!
- V-fib!

501
00:38:22,051 --> 00:38:23,720
Here you go.

502
00:38:26,139 --> 00:38:27,807
Clear!

503
00:38:31,227 --> 00:38:36,816
They just ran out of oxygen. They've got
30 minutes left in the emergency system.

504
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:42,113
They'll suffocate up there. I've got to bring
them down. It's the only chance I've got.

505
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,991
Again.

506
00:38:49,162 --> 00:38:52,165
Hold on. We've got vitals. We got a pulse.

507
00:38:52,248 --> 00:38:54,876
We've got to get him to a hospital.

508
00:38:56,002 --> 00:38:59,297
OTC, this is Houston, Mission Control.
Do you copy?

509
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:01,466
<i>Roger, Houston.</i>

510
00:39:01,549 --> 00:39:03,885
<i>We've got some spooky stuff up here.</i>

511
00:39:03,968 --> 00:39:06,012
OTC, we're gonna bring you down.

512
00:39:06,095 --> 00:39:09,015
We want you to instigate de-orbit burn...

513
00:39:09,098 --> 00:39:11,768
...and begin deceleration.

514
00:39:11,851 --> 00:39:14,896
<i>Roger, Houston.</i>
<i>We kinda hoped you'd say that.</i>

515
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:18,483
<i>Activating OMS rockets.</i>
<i>All systems go for re-entry.</i>

516
00:39:18,566 --> 00:39:20,902
They're bringing the shuttle down.

517
00:39:20,985 --> 00:39:25,907
You said the shuttle would burn up
on re-entry. Can we do anything to save it?

518
00:39:25,990 --> 00:39:29,035
Change the trajectory.

519
00:39:29,244 --> 00:39:35,291
- Change the trajectory to what?
- Change re-entry trajectory to 35 degrees.

520
00:39:40,588 --> 00:39:43,550
T minus 35 seconds
to ionosphere re-entry.

521
00:39:43,633 --> 00:39:46,261
- Change the re-entry trajectory!
<i>- </i> What?

522
00:39:46,344 --> 00:39:50,390
- Change it to 35 degrees!
- 30 seconds to re-entry.

523
00:39:50,473 --> 00:39:52,267
- Colonel Belt...
- I can't!

524
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:54,519
- 25 seconds.
- It's your only shot!

525
00:39:54,602 --> 00:39:57,689
We'd have to change site
and tell them before the blackout.

526
00:39:57,772 --> 00:39:59,357
15 seconds to blackout.

527
00:40:00,483 --> 00:40:05,822
I want to know the weather in Albuquerque!
Are we go for an emergency landing?

528
00:40:05,905 --> 00:40:08,032
Landing conditions go in Albuquerque.

529
00:40:08,116 --> 00:40:10,201
T minus 5 seconds to blackout.

530
00:40:10,285 --> 00:40:14,122
OTC, change your re-entry trajectory
to 35 degrees.

531
00:40:14,205 --> 00:40:17,000
You'll land at Kirtland Field
in Albuquerque. Do you copy?

532
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:20,545
- Blackout in effect.
- Did they get that transmission?

533
00:40:20,628 --> 00:40:23,256
- Two minutes to re-establish.
- Damn it!

534
00:40:29,804 --> 00:40:32,932
- How much oxygen do they have?
- 16 minutes.

535
00:40:35,602 --> 00:40:38,438
OTC, this is Houston. Come in, OTC.

536
00:40:39,814 --> 00:40:41,899
OTC, this is Houston.

537
00:40:41,983 --> 00:40:44,068
Come in, OTC!

538
00:40:45,028 --> 00:40:46,904
Anything?

539
00:40:48,156 --> 00:40:51,909
- What's the point of their new re-entry?
- 500 miles west of Hawaii.

540
00:40:51,993 --> 00:40:53,745
See if Hawaii can...

541
00:40:53,828 --> 00:40:56,372
- Hawaii's got them on radar.
- They made it.

542
00:40:56,456 --> 00:40:57,999
Not necessarily.

543
00:41:00,585 --> 00:41:04,047
<i>Albuquerque, do you have</i>
<i>radar confirmation?</i>

544
00:41:04,422 --> 00:41:07,050
<i>Negative, Houston. Nothing on the screen.</i>

545
00:41:15,183 --> 00:41:18,519
OTC, this is Houston. Come in, OTC.

546
00:41:19,729 --> 00:41:22,857
OTC, this is Houston! Come in, OTC!

547
00:41:23,941 --> 00:41:26,027
<i>Houston, this is OTC.</i>

548
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:28,946
<i>You know a good place to eat</i>
<i>in Albuquerque?</i>

549
00:41:29,030 --> 00:41:33,117
<i>- Thought we'd meet for dinner.</i>

550
00:41:36,204 --> 00:41:38,373
Whoo! OTC, welcome home.

551
00:41:38,456 --> 00:41:41,417
Welcome home, OTC.
You're lookin' real good.

552
00:41:42,377 --> 00:41:43,628
Yes!

553
00:41:55,556 --> 00:42:00,895
<i>The space shuttle touched down today</i>
<i>at 10. 56 Central Standard Time.</i>

554
00:42:00,978 --> 00:42:04,774
<i>The orbiter delivered its payload</i>
<i>afterjust 13 orbits...</i>

555
00:42:04,857 --> 00:42:06,943
<i>..and returned to Earth...</i>

556
00:42:08,194 --> 00:42:10,279
<i>.. without incident.</i>

557
00:42:10,363 --> 00:42:14,117
<i>We at NASA are looking forward</i>
<i>to our next shuttle mission...</i>

558
00:42:14,200 --> 00:42:18,454
<i>..and to future successful explorations</i>
<i>of space, for mankind...</i>

559
00:42:19,539 --> 00:42:21,958
<i>..and for the future of mankind.</i>

560
00:42:54,282 --> 00:42:55,950
No more!

561
00:42:56,409 --> 00:42:58,077
Argh!

562
00:43:23,561 --> 00:43:25,646
I just heard.

563
00:43:28,858 --> 00:43:30,943
Something had possessed him.

564
00:43:31,027 --> 00:43:34,697
Something he must have seen
out there in space.

565
00:43:34,781 --> 00:43:39,660
The doctors who examined him said
he was experiencing severe dementia.

566
00:43:40,703 --> 00:43:43,456
I don't think he ever really knew...

567
00:43:43,539 --> 00:43:46,709
...exactly how it was working through him.

568
00:43:46,793 --> 00:43:49,045
Or, if he ever knew...

569
00:43:49,796 --> 00:43:54,884
...that he was...
responsible for his own actions.

570
00:43:55,009 --> 00:43:58,137
He ordered those x-rays
of the damaged parts.

571
00:43:58,221 --> 00:44:00,807
You saw what I saw, Scully.

572
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:02,975
I think he was trying to warn her.

573
00:44:03,059 --> 00:44:08,147
I think he sent Michelle those x-rays like...
he was trying to reach out to her...

574
00:44:08,231 --> 00:44:10,650
...without quite knowing why.

575
00:44:10,733 --> 00:44:15,363
As if his own instinctual impulse
was to... save those men.

576
00:44:15,446 --> 00:44:18,241
While simultaneously trying to kill them?

577
00:44:19,075 --> 00:44:23,871
Scully, we send those men up into space
to unlock the doors of the universe.

578
00:44:23,955 --> 00:44:26,165
And we don't even know
what's behind them.

579
00:44:26,249 --> 00:44:28,334
I think whatever it was...

580
00:44:28,459 --> 00:44:30,628
...he took it with him.

581
00:44:30,711 --> 00:44:33,714
In the end, that was
the only way he knew how to stop it.

582
00:44:34,090 --> 00:44:36,509
There's an investigation, you know.

583
00:44:37,635 --> 00:44:39,804
They haven't ruled out foul play.

584
00:44:39,929 --> 00:44:42,431
He gave his own life.

585
00:44:45,351 --> 00:44:49,689
As an astronaut, that was something
he was prepared to do.

586
00:44:49,772 --> 00:44:52,942
Colonel Marcus Aurelius Belt
devoted his life...

587
00:44:53,025 --> 00:44:56,153
...to the exploration
and understanding of space.

588
00:44:56,320 --> 00:44:59,073
Learning its mysteries and experiencing it...

589
00:44:59,156 --> 00:45:01,909
...not just for himself, but for humanity.

590
00:45:02,660 --> 00:45:06,956
Lord, take this man's soul
and let it rise up to your heavens...

591
00:45:07,039 --> 00:45:09,667
...higher than he could ever go as a man.

592
00:45:09,792 --> 00:45:14,171
Let him know the true nature
of the universe that he sought to learn.

593
