1
00:00:09,261 --> 00:00:11,305
Yes.

2
00:00:12,598 --> 00:00:15,309
- Love you.
- And I love you.

3
00:00:17,936 --> 00:00:20,022
- Hello.
- Morning, sir.

4
00:00:20,105 --> 00:00:22,232
Good morning.

5
00:00:24,276 --> 00:00:28,488
- Good morning, Cecil.
<i>- </i> Top o' the morning to yeh.

6
00:00:31,283 --> 00:00:33,368
Oh, thank you.

7
00:00:33,452 --> 00:00:36,079
- Goodbye, darling!
- Goodbye, Charles!

8
00:00:36,163 --> 00:00:38,957
- What time can I expect you?
- Before supper.

9
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:49,361
Oh! I forgot what it was like
to spend a day in court.

10
00:01:49,486 --> 00:01:54,032
That's one of the luxuries to hunting
down aliens and genetic mutants.

11
00:01:54,157 --> 00:01:56,201
You rarely get to press charges.

12
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,204
- It's open.
- What?

13
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:02,374
- It's unlocked.
- That's weird.

14
00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:05,085
- I'm sure I locked it.
- Must be an X-File.

15
00:02:14,261 --> 00:02:16,388
What's that?

16
00:02:19,349 --> 00:02:22,227
I told you I locked the door.

17
00:02:25,063 --> 00:02:27,107
What do you think it is?

18
00:02:27,858 --> 00:02:30,235
Ten to one you can't dance to it.

19
00:02:32,696 --> 00:02:35,449
<i>Greetings, Agent Mulder.</i>

20
00:02:35,574 --> 00:02:39,911
<i>Six months ago, British MP</i>
<i>Reggie Ellicott received a cassette...</i>

21
00:02:40,037 --> 00:02:42,539
<i>..like the one you're listening to now.</i>

22
00:02:42,622 --> 00:02:45,917
<i>Unfortunately, when he popped</i>
<i>the tape into the stereo...</i>

23
00:02:46,043 --> 00:02:49,421
<i>..he armed a device which,</i>
<i>when he tried to exit the car...</i>

24
00:02:49,546 --> 00:02:52,591
<i>..created an explosion</i>
<i>heard five miles away.</i>

25
00:02:53,216 --> 00:02:58,805
<i>The Scotland Yard forensic team could only</i>
<i>identify the poor bastard by dental records.</i>

26
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:02,976
<i>If only he hadn't reached for the handle</i>
<i>and triggered the detonator!</i>

27
00:03:03,101 --> 00:03:07,981
<i>But how was he to know he was</i>
<i>sitting on enough plastic explosive...</i>

28
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:10,150
<i>..to lift the car 40 feet...</i>

29
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:14,446
<i>..and deposit the engine block</i>
<i>on top of a three-storey building?</i>

30
00:03:15,739 --> 00:03:18,658
Aren't we looking rather ghostly?

31
00:03:22,954 --> 00:03:24,998
It's an old friend.

32
00:03:26,917 --> 00:03:29,503
- Aren't you going to thank me?
- For what?

33
00:03:29,628 --> 00:03:33,632
Saving your life. One tends not
to make the same mistake twice.

34
00:03:33,757 --> 00:03:37,219
- I'll try to remember that.
- You left your sense of humour...

35
00:03:37,302 --> 00:03:41,056
- ..in Oxford ten years ago?
- It's one of the few things...

36
00:03:41,139 --> 00:03:43,475
...you didn't drive a stake through.

37
00:03:51,691 --> 00:03:54,820
You know, some mistakes
are worth making twice.

38
00:03:57,364 --> 00:04:01,243
Dana Scully, this is Phoebe Green,
terror of Scotland Yard.

39
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:03,412
- Hello.
- Hello.

40
00:04:03,495 --> 00:04:05,580
She hates me.

41
00:04:05,664 --> 00:04:07,791
What brings you to the colonies?

42
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:13,505
Some clever bloke has been giving
the aristocracy a good scare.

43
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:16,633
Killed off a ranking MP
or three for good measure.

44
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:19,845
Set Windsor Castle ablaze in 1992.

45
00:04:20,512 --> 00:04:24,349
- Your car bomber?
- This one likes to burn his victims alive.

46
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:26,852
Can't figure out how he does it either.

47
00:04:26,977 --> 00:04:29,479
Not a crumb of evidence at the crime scene.

48
00:04:29,563 --> 00:04:32,107
The last one died in his front garden...

49
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,735
...his poor wife watching helplessly
as he went up in smoke.

50
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:38,405
The Irish Republican Army?

51
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:42,242
Our suspect likes to send
love letters to his victims' wives.

52
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:46,246
Sent one to the wife of
Sir Malcolm Marsden a month ago.

53
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,668
Three days later he narrowly escaped
a fire in his garage, burned down.

54
00:04:51,751 --> 00:04:55,005
So they're renting a place
out on Cape Cod...

55
00:04:55,088 --> 00:04:58,216
...bringing the family
for an extended holiday.

56
00:04:58,341 --> 00:05:01,761
- Or until we catch the dirty bugger.
- He's that determined?

57
00:05:01,887 --> 00:05:05,432
Judging by his success, he takes
a certain delight in his work.

58
00:05:05,557 --> 00:05:10,103
So what brings you on this detour
to Washington DC, Inspector?

59
00:05:11,688 --> 00:05:13,732
I figured my friend Mulder...

60
00:05:15,442 --> 00:05:18,403
...couldn't resist a three-pipe problem.

61
00:05:18,528 --> 00:05:21,072
I'll run it by our arson specialist.

62
00:05:21,865 --> 00:05:23,283
Splendid.

63
00:05:23,408 --> 00:05:26,036
I'll call London, let them know.

64
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,418
Oh, goodbye.

65
00:05:39,883 --> 00:05:42,135
Three-pipe problem?

66
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:45,722
- From Sherlock Holmes. It's a private joke.
- How private?

67
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:47,891
Um...

68
00:05:48,725 --> 00:05:53,063
We knew each other at school in England.
She was brilliant and, uh...

69
00:05:53,146 --> 00:05:57,442
I got in over my head and I... paid the price.

70
00:05:58,276 --> 00:06:01,321
Mulder, you just keep unfolding
like a flower.

71
00:06:01,446 --> 00:06:04,115
It was over ten years ago, Scully.

72
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:09,663
Yeah. You couldn't drop everything
fast enough to help her out.

73
00:06:09,788 --> 00:06:13,166
I was merely extending her
a professional courtesy.

74
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,585
Oh, is that what you were extending?

75
00:06:15,669 --> 00:06:19,297
I am going to run this by the arson guys,
then she's on her own.

76
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:24,010
Something tells me you're not
going to get rid of her that easily.

77
00:06:28,348 --> 00:06:30,433
Beautiful!

78
00:06:30,517 --> 00:06:33,436
Oh, just beautiful!

79
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,106
Look at that. Salmon-red flames.

80
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:39,818
This is 1400, 1500 degrees.
This is a work of art.

81
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:44,823
Was there any kind of
incendiary device used?

82
00:06:44,948 --> 00:06:47,534
Yes, actually. The victim's body.

83
00:06:48,827 --> 00:06:51,788
- Spontaneous combustion?
- He was murdered.

84
00:06:51,871 --> 00:06:55,292
However, we've no evidence
that tells us how he caught fire.

85
00:06:55,375 --> 00:06:59,838
That's peculiar.
People don't normally just catch on fire.

86
00:06:59,963 --> 00:07:03,508
I mean, we burn,
but we don't conduct all that well.

87
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:08,805
There's usually some extraneous fuel
involved, like candle wax, gasoline...

88
00:07:08,888 --> 00:07:12,559
...something flammable and
incendiary that adheres to skin.

89
00:07:12,684 --> 00:07:16,146
- Like an accelerant?
- Like an accelerant! Yes!

90
00:07:16,229 --> 00:07:19,733
But we found no trace,
save for magnesium at two sites.

91
00:07:19,858 --> 00:07:24,404
That's alathactic pyrolysis,
a residue from an exothermic reaction.

92
00:07:24,696 --> 00:07:28,908
There's no evidence of the source.
No pore pattern or ignition devices.

93
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:33,580
There have been some arson fires
in Seattle lately, and Pennsylvania.

94
00:07:33,705 --> 00:07:37,250
They burn so hot the firemen
can't put them out. 7,000 degrees.

95
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:40,295
- Hosing that down makes it worse.
- How's that?

96
00:07:40,378 --> 00:07:43,298
Well, the, uh... reaction is so intense...

97
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:48,094
...that it splits the water into hydrogen
and oxygen. Just adds fuel to the fire.

98
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:51,222
- What were they using?
- We don't know for sure.

99
00:07:51,348 --> 00:07:55,810
Could be rocket fuel. That burns so hot
and clean there's never a trace left.

100
00:07:55,894 --> 00:07:58,772
You see, it's very difficult to prove arson.

101
00:07:58,897 --> 00:08:02,067
It's driving the insurance companies nuts.

102
00:08:02,192 --> 00:08:05,403
That's about the only explanation
that <i>I</i> can give you.

103
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:09,908
There are cases of pyrokinetics,
people who can control and conduct fire.

104
00:08:11,076 --> 00:08:13,953
Well, I've seen fire bend around corners.

105
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:16,581
I've seen it bounce like a rubber ball.

106
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,709
Fire's got a certain genius, you know...

107
00:08:19,793 --> 00:08:22,754
...a certain... demon poetry.

108
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:25,090
It's like it's got a mind of its own.

109
00:08:25,215 --> 00:08:30,553
But I've never seen one that can defy the
laws of physics. Not when you figure it out.

110
00:08:30,637 --> 00:08:32,097
You've...

111
00:08:32,222 --> 00:08:36,726
...got quite a case for yourself here, Mulder.
I almost wish I could be in your shoes.

112
00:08:57,288 --> 00:08:59,332
Hey, Jackson!

113
00:09:01,084 --> 00:09:04,546
- Boy, that's a nice house!
- What a pleasant surprise!

114
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:07,257
Welcome to America, Sir Malcolm.

115
00:09:34,451 --> 00:09:36,494
In here, please.

116
00:09:36,619 --> 00:09:40,331
And over there as well.
But the second one I want upstairs.

117
00:09:40,457 --> 00:09:45,545
Gentlemen, the second set
of boxes will go directly up the stairs.

118
00:09:45,795 --> 00:09:48,339
<i>- </i> Hello there.
- Hello.

119
00:09:48,465 --> 00:09:50,508
I'm Bob, the caretaker.

120
00:09:50,633 --> 00:09:53,720
- We've been exchanging letters.
- Oh, hello, Bob!

121
00:09:53,845 --> 00:09:55,847
Excuse the paint. Hi.

122
00:09:55,972 --> 00:10:00,351
- Just trying to spruce the place up for you.
- Well, it's delightful.

123
00:10:00,477 --> 00:10:04,272
- The photos don't do it justice.
- Anything I can do for you...

124
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:06,691
...anything at all, you just holler.

125
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:08,234
Thank you, Bob.

126
00:10:10,528 --> 00:10:13,865
- He seems like a rather nice fellow.
- Very.

127
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,867
My God, darling!

128
00:10:15,992 --> 00:10:18,578
That painting rather looks like you.

129
00:10:18,703 --> 00:10:20,705
Do you think?

130
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,750
Oh, I don't know.

131
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:47,023
Bloody little cur! I'll skin you alive!

132
00:10:51,194 --> 00:10:53,238
You see? <i>I'm</i> the caretaker now.

133
00:10:58,243 --> 00:11:00,286
So, Sherlock, is the game afoot?

134
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:02,455
Afraid so, Watson.

135
00:11:03,248 --> 00:11:05,500
But you're off the hook on this one.

136
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:07,669
What do you mean?

137
00:11:07,752 --> 00:11:10,088
I'm not going to put you through this.

138
00:11:10,213 --> 00:11:13,424
- Put me through what?
- Phoebe's little mind game.

139
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:15,593
What are you talking about?

140
00:11:16,135 --> 00:11:20,390
There's something else
I haven't told you about myself, Scully.

141
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:26,312
I hate fire. Hate it.

142
00:11:27,105 --> 00:11:29,148
I'm scared to death of it.

143
00:11:31,776 --> 00:11:35,113
When I was a kid,
my best friend's house burned down.

144
00:11:35,238 --> 00:11:38,992
I had to spend the night in the rubble,
to keep away looters.

145
00:11:39,117 --> 00:11:43,872
For years I had nightmares about
being trapped in a burning building.

146
00:11:43,955 --> 00:11:47,917
- And Phoebe knows about this?
- This is classic Phoebe Green.

147
00:11:48,001 --> 00:11:50,503
Mind-game player extraordinaire.

148
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:53,673
Ten years, and then
she shows up with a case like this.

149
00:11:53,798 --> 00:11:58,678
She shows up knowing the power she has
over you and makes you walk through fire.

150
00:11:58,803 --> 00:12:00,805
Phoebe <i>is</i> fire.

151
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:04,475
Are you sure you don't want me
to help you out on this one?

152
00:12:04,601 --> 00:12:07,645
Sooner or later,
a man's gotta face his demons.

153
00:13:01,074 --> 00:13:03,534
Hello. You're the Marsdens' driver?

154
00:13:04,994 --> 00:13:07,038
Who's that?

155
00:13:08,665 --> 00:13:10,333
Bob.

156
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,043
The caretaker.

157
00:13:15,213 --> 00:13:16,422
Oh. Yeah.

158
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:19,384
- Bum a smoke?
- Yeah, sure.

159
00:13:27,725 --> 00:13:30,520
I'm going into town. Can I get you anything?

160
00:13:30,603 --> 00:13:33,314
Some cough medicine, if it's no problem.

161
00:13:33,398 --> 00:13:36,359
Syrup or... uh... lozenges?

162
00:13:38,403 --> 00:13:40,530
Syrup'd be good.

163
00:13:42,532 --> 00:13:44,784
Can I give you some money?

164
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:46,953
I appreciate that!

165
00:13:58,589 --> 00:14:00,633
Beer.

166
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:20,570
They don't let you bring
your own around here.

167
00:14:22,238 --> 00:14:27,243
I guess they'll just have
to make an exception... won't they?

168
00:14:30,413 --> 00:14:32,457
You're English!

169
00:14:32,999 --> 00:14:35,460
God, I just love that accent!

170
00:14:37,253 --> 00:14:39,297
Allow me.

171
00:14:39,422 --> 00:14:41,466
A gentleman, to boot.

172
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:49,098
Oh, my God!

173
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,642
Now, that is a trick!

174
00:14:51,768 --> 00:14:54,812
Hey, guys! Take a look at this!

175
00:14:59,192 --> 00:15:02,320
- Care for a light?

176
00:15:18,377 --> 00:15:20,546
I pulled this report off the wire.

177
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:25,051
A customer in a bar caught fire,
but they're still looking for a body.

178
00:15:25,176 --> 00:15:27,678
Any indication an accelerant was used?

179
00:15:27,804 --> 00:15:32,767
The bar is across from a fire station.
Burned down before they could respond.

180
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:36,437
It turned the concrete foundation
into sponge cake.

181
00:15:36,521 --> 00:15:38,523
This is a woman who was in the bar.

182
00:15:41,025 --> 00:15:42,360
- Hello.
- Hello.

183
00:15:42,485 --> 00:15:44,237
- Miss Gotchek?
- Yes.

184
00:15:44,362 --> 00:15:48,699
I'm Special Agent Mulder from the FBI.
This is Inspector Green.

185
00:15:51,327 --> 00:15:55,248
- Can you tell us what happened in the bar?
- There was this guy.

186
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,043
I'd had a few drinks, so...

187
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:03,756
He sat next to me and...

188
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:05,925
...he did this thing.

189
00:16:06,217 --> 00:16:09,762
It was like a magic trick
where he lit his finger on fire.

190
00:16:12,557 --> 00:16:15,059
When I turned around he was up in flames.

191
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:20,731
- Can you describe him?
- Good-looking, I think.

192
00:16:20,857 --> 00:16:22,817
Brownish hair.

193
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:26,445
- Long hair? Short hair?
- I've already told the police.

194
00:16:26,571 --> 00:16:29,574
Could you work with an artist
and come up with a sketch?

195
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:32,743
- I had a few drinks.
- Can I get your name and address?

196
00:16:32,869 --> 00:16:34,871
See...

197
00:16:36,122 --> 00:16:38,249
I live with someone.

198
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:42,461
- He thinks I was at school last night.
- It's no problem.

199
00:16:42,587 --> 00:16:46,132
You can come down to the field office
and work with somebody.

200
00:16:46,257 --> 00:16:49,760
I'll give you a minute to think about it, OK?

201
00:16:57,435 --> 00:16:59,520
Deftly done, Agent Mulder.

202
00:16:59,604 --> 00:17:02,148
Casually disregard her indiscretion.

203
00:17:02,273 --> 00:17:04,692
Firm but polite until she co-operates.

204
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:07,820
A technique I refined in
my relationship with you.

205
00:17:10,072 --> 00:17:13,117
Oh. I see you haven't lost
your sense of humour.

206
00:17:16,245 --> 00:17:18,289
I'm sorry. That was a cheap shot.

207
00:17:18,998 --> 00:17:21,167
I don't want to dredge up the past.

208
00:17:22,627 --> 00:17:25,129
- Let's just stick to the case.
- Let's.

209
00:17:32,762 --> 00:17:35,514
- Look, Phoebe...
- Unless I'm mistaken...

210
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,976
...ten years seems time
to have forgiven if not forgotten...

211
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:44,649
- ..a few youthful indiscretions.
- I'm cursed with a photographic memory.

212
00:17:45,149 --> 00:17:48,277
Then don't you tell me
that you've forgotten...

213
00:17:48,361 --> 00:17:50,947
...a certain youthful indiscretion...

214
00:17:51,447 --> 00:17:54,283
...atop Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's tombstone...

215
00:17:54,367 --> 00:17:57,787
...on a misty night in Windlesham.

216
00:17:58,829 --> 00:18:01,707
Like I said, let's just stick to the case.

217
00:18:03,793 --> 00:18:07,338
It occurred to me that
we're going to a lot of trouble...

218
00:18:07,463 --> 00:18:11,175
...to find the description of a man
who was burnt to a crisp.

219
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,553
I would agree,
but they haven't found a body yet.

220
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:21,102
So, can we count on you?

221
00:18:21,185 --> 00:18:23,020
Yeah. OK.

222
00:18:24,522 --> 00:18:26,565
I don't know if it matters...

223
00:18:26,691 --> 00:18:30,861
...but I remembered something else
about the guy who caught fire.

224
00:18:30,987 --> 00:18:33,030
He had an English accent.

225
00:18:41,247 --> 00:18:44,000
Having a rough time, huh?

226
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:54,385
Maybe it's the cough syrup.

227
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:27,418
<i>After reviewing the files of</i>
<i>the Scotland Yard arson murders...</i>

228
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:32,631
<i>..two points remain unexplained.</i>
<i>One is the use of an untraceable accelerant.</i>

229
00:19:32,757 --> 00:19:35,301
<i>The other involves the victims.</i>

230
00:19:35,885 --> 00:19:41,390
<i>Since they all burned in the presence</i>
<i>of family members in safe surroundings...</i>

231
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:47,104
<i>..this indicates unusually intimate access</i>
<i>to the victims by the arsonist.</i>

232
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:51,734
<i>The arsonist is most likely a male,</i>
<i>less than 25 years of age.</i>

233
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:54,487
<i>He will often act out of impulse...</i>

234
00:19:54,612 --> 00:19:59,450
<i>..satisfying sexual urges or insecurities</i>
<i>with destructive behaviour...</i>

235
00:19:59,575 --> 00:20:03,329
<i>.. which compensates for social</i>
<i>inadequacies or maladjustment.</i>

236
00:20:03,954 --> 00:20:07,666
- You boys want to see a magic trick?
- OK.

237
00:20:08,834 --> 00:20:11,212
- What's your names?
- Michael. And Jimmie.

238
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:13,422
- Doesn't he talk?
- Yes!

239
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:19,303
- What kind of magic trick?
- Maybe I'd better not.

240
00:20:19,428 --> 00:20:21,931
- Show us!
- You might tell your mom and dad.

241
00:20:22,014 --> 00:20:24,100
- We won't tell.
- Really?

242
00:20:24,183 --> 00:20:26,310
- Promise?
- Promise.

243
00:20:26,477 --> 00:20:29,146
Hope to die? Stick a needle in your eye?

244
00:20:30,773 --> 00:20:35,194
OK, boys. You've taken the solemn oath
of trust that can't be broken...

245
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:38,155
...except... under penalty...

246
00:20:38,531 --> 00:20:40,658
...of death.

247
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:47,206
Watch.

248
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,335
- Is it in there?
- No.

249
00:20:51,836 --> 00:20:53,963
Ah! You're too smart for me!

250
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:56,966
- Where did it go?
- Where <i>did</i> it go?

251
00:20:57,049 --> 00:20:59,593
- Where do <i>you</i> think, Jimmie?
- I don't know.

252
00:20:59,677 --> 00:21:01,762
Uh...

253
00:21:01,846 --> 00:21:03,973
I think I remember.

254
00:21:07,685 --> 00:21:09,812
Ah... ah... ah!

255
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:12,523
Da-da!

256
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,362
- Do it again!
- You want me to do it again?

257
00:21:18,529 --> 00:21:20,573
OK. I'll do it again.

258
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:30,332
Agent Beatty?
I'm Special Agent Dana Scully.

259
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:33,210
- Can I steal a minute of your time?
- Yeah, sure.

260
00:21:33,335 --> 00:21:37,089
Come in. I'm just working on
this Mafia torch job here.

261
00:21:37,214 --> 00:21:39,425
I'm... working with Agent Mulder.

262
00:21:39,550 --> 00:21:41,469
Oh, yeah. Wild case.

263
00:21:41,552 --> 00:21:43,637
So, what can I do for you?

264
00:21:43,721 --> 00:21:49,143
You said the arsonist might be using
some kind of rocket fuel as an accelerant.

265
00:21:49,226 --> 00:21:52,897
Just speculation. It doesn't explain
how he sets bodies on fire.

266
00:21:53,022 --> 00:21:56,192
What if he got some of this fuel into some...

267
00:21:56,275 --> 00:21:58,777
...hand cream, or...

268
00:21:58,903 --> 00:22:01,947
Well, you've got to understand that...

269
00:22:02,072 --> 00:22:07,703
...even the smallest amounts of this stuff can
produce temperatures over 5,000 degrees.

270
00:22:07,786 --> 00:22:10,039
But I suppose it's not impossible.

271
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:14,084
Extremely diluted.
He'd still have to find a way to ignite it.

272
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,506
Wow! It lit by itself!

273
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:20,716
Come on. Sit down.

274
00:22:22,593 --> 00:22:24,220
So...

275
00:22:24,303 --> 00:22:28,015
- You guys ever smoked a cigarette?
- No, they're bad for you.

276
00:22:28,098 --> 00:22:30,392
Would you like a puff, Michael?

277
00:22:31,936 --> 00:22:34,230
- No.
- Make a man out of you.

278
00:22:34,313 --> 00:22:37,608
- I don't want to.
- Why don't you hold one for me?

279
00:22:41,737 --> 00:22:43,781
How about you, Jimmie?

280
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:47,409
Huh? Little man?

281
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:58,963
Jimmie! Michael!

282
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,425
Hello.

283
00:23:03,509 --> 00:23:05,135
Bob... Ugh!

284
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:09,473
We've had a bit of bad news.

285
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:14,144
Our driver has taken ill and we're due
at a party in Boston this evening.

286
00:23:14,270 --> 00:23:18,482
Is there any chance that we can impose
upon you to drive the family into town?

287
00:23:18,607 --> 00:23:22,695
We'd be happy to pay you for your time
and put you up for the night.

288
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,282
- I'd be very happy to do it as a favour.
- Good. Thank you.

289
00:23:26,365 --> 00:23:29,159
Boys, let's go. Daddy's got lunch all ready.

290
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:42,172
<i>The arsonist is usually unmarried</i>
<i>and prone to obsessive fantasies...</i>

291
00:23:42,298 --> 00:23:44,633
<i>..about women or men inaccessible to him.</i>

292
00:23:44,717 --> 00:23:47,595
<i>The setting of fires</i>
<i>results from his cowardice...</i>

293
00:23:47,678 --> 00:23:51,098
<i>..and inability to develop</i>
<i>a natural relationship.</i>

294
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:55,811
<i>His crimes are often very clever</i>
<i>and elaborately planned.</i>

295
00:23:55,894 --> 00:24:00,274
<i>The suspicious nature of the fire</i>
<i>last night strongly suggests...</i>

296
00:24:00,357 --> 00:24:04,737
<i>..the arsonist has followed</i>
<i>Lord Marsden to the United States.</i>

297
00:24:04,862 --> 00:24:09,533
<i>A check of all recent immigration</i>
<i>to the northeastern area is under way.</i>

298
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:13,454
<i>It has become not a matter of</i> if...

299
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:15,623
<i>..but</i> when <i>he will strike.</i>

300
00:24:15,706 --> 00:24:19,293
- Here's that immigration data you wanted.
- Thank you.

301
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:21,503
You're welcome.

302
00:24:24,423 --> 00:24:28,844
Remember those reports about people
who can control and conduct fire?

303
00:24:28,927 --> 00:24:32,431
- Vaguely.
- This guy just told us he's far more exotic.

304
00:24:32,556 --> 00:24:35,392
I should say so, if he can set himself on fire.

305
00:24:36,727 --> 00:24:39,897
- What?
- I'm not used to someone so quick to agree.

306
00:24:40,022 --> 00:24:42,858
- Oh.
- What protection does the family have?

307
00:24:42,941 --> 00:24:44,693
The driver's a very capable bodyguard.

308
00:24:44,777 --> 00:24:48,405
He should get more men and limit exposure.

309
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:51,742
There's a party
in their honour tonight in Boston.

310
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:55,412
- They'll have to cancel.
- Unless you want to set a trap.

311
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:58,749
I had thought of that...

312
00:24:58,874 --> 00:25:01,710
...but we must be careful and discreet.

313
00:25:01,794 --> 00:25:06,465
The party's at eight, at the Venable Plaza.
I'll travel with the family.

314
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:09,593
Why don't you go on ahead
and have a look around?

315
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:12,971
Oh, and I've taken a room
at the hotel for the night.

316
00:25:30,906 --> 00:25:32,950
Thanks.

317
00:25:34,410 --> 00:25:36,912
Thank you.

318
00:26:01,019 --> 00:26:03,647
- Mulder.
- It's Scully. Where are you?

319
00:26:04,273 --> 00:26:06,984
- I'm in Boston.
<i>- I've got something to show you.</i>

320
00:26:07,109 --> 00:26:10,112
- I'm going to come up there.
- What have you got?

321
00:26:10,195 --> 00:26:13,490
I might have information on
the identity of your arsonist.

322
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:19,204
- Are you there, Mulder?
- Yeah.

323
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:22,416
- Yeah.
- Can I meet you somewhere?

324
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:26,211
It's just that I'm kind of
anticipating having my hands full.

325
00:26:32,342 --> 00:26:34,386
Hey! We're here!

326
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:36,555
- Phoebe.
- Thank you.

327
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:38,724
- Evening, sir.
- Hello.

328
00:27:27,773 --> 00:27:29,858
Enjoying yourself?

329
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:34,196
Good food, witty conversation...
I'm having the time of my life.

330
00:27:37,574 --> 00:27:42,246
I wondered if you think it's safe enough
to indulge ourselves in a dance.

331
00:27:42,371 --> 00:27:46,625
It doesn't look like your arsonist
is going to make an appearance.

332
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:50,128
That doesn't mean
there won't be any fires to put out.

333
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:01,056
I've thought about you often.

334
00:28:45,017 --> 00:28:47,728
There's a fire upstairs!

335
00:28:47,811 --> 00:28:49,897
- What?
- On the 14th floor.

336
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:52,149
That's where the children are.

337
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:10,167
You've got a fire on the 14th floor!

338
00:29:30,646 --> 00:29:32,689
Help us!

339
00:30:20,779 --> 00:30:22,864
Here we go! We got one down!

340
00:30:22,948 --> 00:30:25,075
Come on, buddy! Come on!

341
00:30:27,536 --> 00:30:30,038
- Can you walk?
- I got him.

342
00:30:35,377 --> 00:30:38,255
- Here we are.
- Jimmie! Michael!

343
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:44,845
You saved their lives!

344
00:30:44,928 --> 00:30:48,140
- Who is he?
- He's the driver.

345
00:31:00,944 --> 00:31:02,988
Well done! Good job.

346
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,006
You were really out.

347
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:28,180
- Where's Phoebe?
- She's down the hall.

348
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:34,686
- What about the kids?
- OK. The doctor checked them out.

349
00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:45,197
What happened to you up there?

350
00:31:47,783 --> 00:31:50,494
I panicked. Couldn't move, Scully.

351
00:31:51,203 --> 00:31:53,371
It could have happened to anyone.

352
00:31:53,497 --> 00:31:55,540
Yeah. But it happened to <i>me.</i>

353
00:31:55,665 --> 00:31:57,709
I haired out.

354
00:31:57,834 --> 00:31:59,878
Plain and simple.

355
00:32:00,545 --> 00:32:05,175
What do you know about this guy
that saved the kids? The driver?

356
00:32:05,842 --> 00:32:09,012
I checked him out
prior to the Marsdens' arrival.

357
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,226
He's worked on the property
for eight years. No record.

358
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:17,979
His references checked out.
They were lucky he was here.

359
00:32:18,063 --> 00:32:20,857
- Who was watching the kids tonight?
- He was.

360
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:25,529
I could have sworn I saw him in the hall
about the time the fire broke out.

361
00:32:25,654 --> 00:32:28,990
You couldn't have.
Anyway, our suspect is English.

362
00:32:29,157 --> 00:32:30,826
Hey.

363
00:32:32,702 --> 00:32:34,496
I came to see if you were OK.

364
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:39,167
- How are the kids?
- They're fine.

365
00:32:39,251 --> 00:32:41,419
Everybody's anxious to get back.

366
00:32:41,545 --> 00:32:43,213
- To the Cape?
- Only to pack.

367
00:32:43,338 --> 00:32:47,175
They're travelling back to England
the day after tomorrow.

368
00:32:47,259 --> 00:32:49,386
And you?

369
00:32:50,178 --> 00:32:52,222
I'll be leaving in a few days.

370
00:32:56,434 --> 00:33:00,355
I'll give you a ring
back at the Bureau before I leave.

371
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:06,528
Goodbye.

372
00:33:08,697 --> 00:33:10,574
Are you OK?

373
00:33:10,699 --> 00:33:12,742
Yeah.

374
00:33:12,868 --> 00:33:17,497
Are you at all interested in what
I came all the way up here to show you?

375
00:33:17,581 --> 00:33:19,583
Yeah.

376
00:33:22,127 --> 00:33:24,921
Well, I did some checking on my own.

377
00:33:25,046 --> 00:33:30,677
I didn't know a whole lot about arson
or arsonists, so I took the opportunity.

378
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:33,638
For my own edification, of course.

379
00:33:35,432 --> 00:33:39,603
I ran a profile of possible
incendiary fuels and accelerants...

380
00:33:39,728 --> 00:33:42,272
...that could have been used in the crimes.

381
00:33:42,397 --> 00:33:46,443
I also took the liberty of running
a search through Interpol...

382
00:33:46,568 --> 00:33:51,740
...of all the gardeners and domestic help
that were hired by the murder victims.

383
00:33:51,823 --> 00:33:54,242
- And?
- And...

384
00:33:54,326 --> 00:33:57,829
These people probably don't
even tie their own shoes.

385
00:33:57,954 --> 00:34:00,373
There were over 200 names...

386
00:34:00,457 --> 00:34:03,293
...and not a duplicate... except one.

387
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:06,213
A Cecil Lively.

388
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:09,257
He worked as a gardener
for two of the victims.

389
00:34:09,341 --> 00:34:11,676
- What did you find on him?
- Nothing.

390
00:34:11,927 --> 00:34:13,720
- So he's clean?
- Apparently...

391
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:17,682
...he was questioned by Scotland Yard
and they released him.

392
00:34:17,807 --> 00:34:19,851
But I dug a little further.

393
00:34:19,976 --> 00:34:24,439
Cecil Lively is a documented
citizen of Great Britain.

394
00:34:24,522 --> 00:34:28,652
Paid his taxes, never been on the dole...
A model citizen.

395
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:32,697
Until he died in 1971 in
a London tenement fire.

396
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:36,368
I know. That's what I thought.

397
00:34:36,493 --> 00:34:38,536
So, I checked a little further.

398
00:34:38,662 --> 00:34:43,458
Cecil L'lvely, spelled L apostrophe,
came up again. In fact, it came up twice.

399
00:34:43,541 --> 00:34:48,380
On a list of death certificates, among
children who died in ritual sacrifice...

400
00:34:48,505 --> 00:34:53,301
...by a satanic cult in 1963 in the
Tautingham Woods outside Bath, England.

401
00:34:53,385 --> 00:34:56,888
- Where else did you find it?
- You're gonna love this.

402
00:34:57,013 --> 00:35:00,767
On a list of recent visas issued
by the British Government.

403
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:04,229
Cecil L'lvely's passport was
stamped by US Immigration...

404
00:35:04,354 --> 00:35:06,356
...two weeks ago in Boston.

405
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:12,737
Call the local field office in Boston
of the FBI and get them to fax you...

406
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:15,240
...the composite the witness did.

407
00:35:15,365 --> 00:35:17,993
Fax it to every local
law enforcement agency.

408
00:35:18,076 --> 00:35:20,704
- What are you gonna do?
- Try and catch Phoebe.

409
00:35:20,829 --> 00:35:23,581
This guy could be waiting
for them at Cape Cod.

410
00:35:27,168 --> 00:35:29,379
Yes. This is Special Agent Scully.

411
00:35:29,504 --> 00:35:34,926
I've been waiting on hold for you guys
to fax me a composite of an arson suspect.

412
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:37,095
Right. Hang on a second.

413
00:35:37,554 --> 00:35:40,181
It's coming through. Thanks.

414
00:35:50,025 --> 00:35:52,068
Oh, my God!

415
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:54,237
It's the driver.

416
00:36:01,077 --> 00:36:05,206
<i>The cellular customer you are</i>
<i>trying to reach is out of the area.</i>

417
00:36:27,312 --> 00:36:29,439
Excuse me.

418
00:36:34,652 --> 00:36:36,738
His name is Cecil L'lvely.

419
00:36:36,821 --> 00:36:38,907
- Who?
- Your arsonist.

420
00:36:38,990 --> 00:36:41,076
Where's the rest of the family?

421
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:44,412
- They went outside for a walk.
- Well, go find them.

422
00:36:44,496 --> 00:36:47,290
We've got to get them packed
and out of here.

423
00:36:52,128 --> 00:36:54,255
Come on, hurry! Let's go!

424
00:37:21,991 --> 00:37:24,077
It's the driver.

425
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,287
I know. He disappeared.

426
00:37:27,497 --> 00:37:29,541
What's the matter?

427
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:32,127
Nothing. Um...

428
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:36,339
I found this out in the garage...
It's been very hard on the family.

429
00:37:36,464 --> 00:37:38,591
Did you get the composite?

430
00:37:38,675 --> 00:37:41,553
- Yes.
- I don't believe it. I <i>can't</i> believe it.

431
00:37:41,678 --> 00:37:47,517
- He's worked for us for over ten years.
- Obviously there's been some mistake.

432
00:37:48,393 --> 00:37:50,019
Oh.

433
00:37:50,145 --> 00:37:52,021
Oh, my God!

434
00:37:52,147 --> 00:37:57,235
- This isn't the driver! It's the caretaker!
- He's upstairs with the children!

435
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:02,073
Michael!

436
00:38:02,532 --> 00:38:04,284
Michael!

437
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:06,494
Jimmie!

438
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:16,254
Looks like we've found the missing driver.

439
00:38:16,379 --> 00:38:18,381
Mulder! In here, quickly!

440
00:38:18,506 --> 00:38:22,552
- What's going on?!
- They just went off - all by themselves!

441
00:38:25,263 --> 00:38:26,514
My God!

442
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:42,864
- Oh, my God!
- Everybody out!

443
00:38:49,037 --> 00:38:51,789
- I think he rigged the whole house.
- Oh, no!

444
00:38:53,458 --> 00:38:55,585
It's fuel.

445
00:38:56,711 --> 00:38:58,755
Go! Go!

446
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:00,924
Come on! Move! Move!

447
00:39:03,259 --> 00:39:05,470
Scully, find a fire extinguisher.

448
00:39:05,595 --> 00:39:08,306
- Everybody else, out!
- What about the children?

449
00:39:08,431 --> 00:39:12,352
I'll take care of the children.

450
00:39:12,435 --> 00:39:14,020
Go!

451
00:39:14,103 --> 00:39:17,690
- Are you going to be OK, Mulder?
- Oh, yeah. I'll be fine.

452
00:39:17,774 --> 00:39:20,401
There's no place I'd rather be.

453
00:39:42,674 --> 00:39:44,759
Michael! Jimmie!

454
00:39:44,842 --> 00:39:46,928
Are you in there?

455
00:39:47,011 --> 00:39:49,138
Help!

456
00:39:53,851 --> 00:39:56,104
Time to call 911?

457
00:39:57,522 --> 00:39:58,815
Don't move!

458
00:40:24,674 --> 00:40:26,718
Freeze!

459
00:40:26,843 --> 00:40:28,886
Federal Agent.

460
00:40:29,012 --> 00:40:31,055
You won't shoot me.

461
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:35,476
Stay right where you are!

462
00:40:37,228 --> 00:40:39,355
See?

463
00:40:40,356 --> 00:40:42,400
Cos you don't know...

464
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:45,236
...the spark from that round...

465
00:40:45,361 --> 00:40:48,364
...won't blow this whole house
to kingdom come.

466
00:41:05,590 --> 00:41:06,758
Aagh!

467
00:41:06,883 --> 00:41:10,011
Back off, Scully! It's the accelerant!

468
00:41:13,723 --> 00:41:16,225
Someone help us!

469
00:41:43,586 --> 00:41:48,216
- Oh, my boys! My babies!
- Michael! Jimmie! Thank God! Thank God!

470
00:41:55,932 --> 00:41:58,309
You can't kill me!

471
00:42:06,401 --> 00:42:09,153
You can't fight fire...

472
00:42:09,278 --> 00:42:11,322
...with fire!

473
00:42:34,762 --> 00:42:37,473
Care to take me to lunch?

474
00:42:38,015 --> 00:42:40,101
Scare you?

475
00:42:40,184 --> 00:42:41,477
You have no idea.

476
00:42:42,478 --> 00:42:44,522
Where <i>is</i> Phoebe?

477
00:42:44,647 --> 00:42:47,775
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

478
00:42:49,152 --> 00:42:51,654
- She didn't call?
- No.

479
00:42:51,779 --> 00:42:55,491
- She did messenger this to me last night.
- Did you play it?

480
00:42:56,951 --> 00:42:59,787
- No.
- Why not?

481
00:42:59,871 --> 00:43:02,623
Aren't you curious what's on it?

482
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:06,210
Ten to one you can't dance to it.

483
00:43:12,383 --> 00:43:15,344
<i>Χ-File number 11214893.</i>

484
00:43:16,012 --> 00:43:19,348
<i>Addendum to the file opened</i>
<i>by Special Agent Mulder.</i>

485
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:24,228
<i>The arson suspect, Cecil L'lvely,</i>
<i>was admitted to Boston Mercy Hospital...</i>

486
00:43:24,353 --> 00:43:28,065
<i>.. with fifth and sixth degree</i>
<i>burns over his entire body.</i>

487
00:43:28,191 --> 00:43:30,735
<i>Military burns specialists have been...</i>

488
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:35,656
<i>..brought in to study the case,</i>
<i>which they're calling extraordinary...</i>

489
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:37,950
<i>..as the suspect not only survived,</i>

490
00:43:38,034 --> 00:43:41,829
<i>but also had rapid regeneration</i>
<i>of his basal cell tissue.</i>

491
00:43:41,913 --> 00:43:45,374
<i>Full recovery is anticipated</i>
<i>in as little as a month.</i>

492
00:43:48,544 --> 00:43:52,089
<i>L'lvely is being held</i>
<i>in a high-security medical facility,</i>

493
00:43:52,173 --> 00:43:54,717
<i>confined to a hyperbaric chamber...</i>

494
00:43:54,842 --> 00:43:59,222
<i>..until he can be tried for the murder</i>
<i>of a Massachusetts caretaker.</i>

495
00:43:59,347 --> 00:44:02,809
<i>His body temperature remains</i>
<i>at a steady 109 degrees.</i>

496
00:44:02,892 --> 00:44:06,813
<i>Health technicians have removed</i>
<i>anything flammable from his room...</i>

497
00:44:06,896 --> 00:44:09,440
<i>.. due to several fires in the vicinity.</i>

498
00:44:09,565 --> 00:44:13,110
<i>According to Agent Mulder,</i>
<i>further incarceration...</i>

499
00:44:13,236 --> 00:44:16,614
<i>..remains a problem for</i>
<i>federal penal authorities.</i>

500
00:44:17,365 --> 00:44:19,700
Can I get you anything, sir?

501
00:44:24,080 --> 00:44:26,541
I'm just dying for a cigarette.

502
00:45:01,158 --> 00:45:03,452
<i>I made this!</i>
