1
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:40,686
<i>Hi, you've reached</i>
<i>the Usher residence.</i>

2
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:43,272
<i>Please leave a message at the tone.</i>
<i>Thank you.</i>

3
00:01:43,355 --> 00:01:47,859
Hi, honey. It's about 8.30
and, um... I'm going to be here for a while.

4
00:01:47,943 --> 00:01:50,195
The presentation didn't go so well.

5
00:01:50,279 --> 00:01:52,364
Call me. I love you. Bye.

6
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,488
- Aghh!

7
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:11,711
Guess who I ran into
from our class at Quantico?

8
00:04:11,795 --> 00:04:15,006
- Marty Neil.
- J Edgar Jr?

9
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,175
Just got bumped up.

10
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:20,220
Foreign Counterintelligence,
New York City Bureau.

11
00:04:20,303 --> 00:04:22,389
Supervisory Special Agent.

12
00:04:22,472 --> 00:04:24,516
- Supervisory?
- That's right.

13
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:27,436
Two years out of the Academy.
How did he land that?

14
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:29,855
Lucked into the World Trade Center
bombing.

15
00:04:30,564 --> 00:04:32,065
Well, good for Marty.

16
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,485
Oh, come on, Dana! The guy is a loser.
Look where he is now.

17
00:04:35,569 --> 00:04:37,529
It's where <i>we</i> should be.

18
00:04:37,654 --> 00:04:41,283
Brad Wilson told me
the psychological profile you wrote...

19
00:04:41,366 --> 00:04:45,412
...on the Washington Crossing killer
led them straight to the suspect.

20
00:04:45,537 --> 00:04:49,458
Word has it you're on
the Violent Crimes Section's fast track.

21
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,084
So, how are you doing?

22
00:04:51,209 --> 00:04:55,380
Have you had any close encounters
of the third kind?

23
00:04:57,007 --> 00:04:59,426
Is that what everyone thinks I do?

24
00:04:59,551 --> 00:05:03,805
No, of course not.
But you do work with Spooky Mulder.

25
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:08,477
Mulder's ideas may be a bit out there,
but he is a great agent.

26
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,521
Yeah, well, I've got this case
that's out there.

27
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:13,940
Baltimore PD calls.

28
00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:17,110
They want our help on a serial killer profile.

29
00:05:17,235 --> 00:05:21,281
Three murders. Began six weeks ago.
Victims vary in age, race, gender.

30
00:05:21,406 --> 00:05:24,409
- No known connections.
- I take it there's a pattern?

31
00:05:24,534 --> 00:05:26,786
Point of entry.
Actually, the lack of one.

32
00:05:26,912 --> 00:05:28,371
What do you mean?

33
00:05:28,455 --> 00:05:31,166
One victim, college girl,
killed in her dorm room.

34
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:35,212
She was found with the windows locked
and the door chained from the inside.

35
00:05:35,295 --> 00:05:39,341
The last incident, two days ago.
High-security office building.

36
00:05:39,424 --> 00:05:43,970
Nothing on the security monitors.
Janitor spoke to the victim minutes before.

37
00:05:44,095 --> 00:05:46,681
Didn't hear or see a thing
out of the ordinary.

38
00:05:46,765 --> 00:05:47,891
Suicides?

39
00:05:54,105 --> 00:05:57,275
Each victim was found
with their liver ripped out.

40
00:05:58,985 --> 00:06:01,613
- No cutting tool was used.
- Bare hands?

41
00:06:03,573 --> 00:06:06,785
- This looks like an X-File.
- Let's not get carried away.

42
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,162
I'm gonna solve these murders, but...

43
00:06:09,287 --> 00:06:12,123
...I would like you
to go over the case histories.

44
00:06:12,249 --> 00:06:15,085
Maybe come down to the crime scene.

45
00:06:15,168 --> 00:06:17,379
Do you want me to ask Mulder?

46
00:06:17,462 --> 00:06:21,132
OK. If he wants to come
and do you a favour, great!

47
00:06:21,258 --> 00:06:24,010
But make sure he knows this is my case.

48
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:27,347
Dana, if I can break a case like this one...

49
00:06:27,472 --> 00:06:29,975
...I'll be getting <i>my</i> bump up the ladder.

50
00:06:30,350 --> 00:06:31,601
And you...

51
00:06:33,144 --> 00:06:35,855
Maybe you won't have to be
Mrs Spooky any more.

52
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:43,363
<i>- </i> So why didn't they ask me?
- They're friends from the Academy.

53
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:46,658
I'm sure they just felt
more comfortable talking to me.

54
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:48,868
Why would I make them so uncomfortable?

55
00:06:48,952 --> 00:06:52,289
It probably has to do with your reputation.

56
00:06:52,372 --> 00:06:55,375
Reputation? I have a reputation?

57
00:06:55,500 --> 00:07:00,839
Colton plays by the book and you don't.
They feel your methods, your theories are...

58
00:07:00,964 --> 00:07:02,173
Spooky?

59
00:07:04,134 --> 00:07:07,637
- Do you think I'm spooky?
<i>- </i> Agent Scully's in here, sir.

60
00:07:08,305 --> 00:07:09,598
Dana!

61
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:11,349
Sorry I'm late.

62
00:07:11,474 --> 00:07:13,310
We just got here.

63
00:07:13,393 --> 00:07:16,187
Uh... Fox Mulder. Tom Colton.

64
00:07:17,314 --> 00:07:21,651
So, Mulder, what do you think? Does this
look like the work of little green men?

65
00:07:21,735 --> 00:07:23,612
- Grey.
- Excuse me?

66
00:07:23,695 --> 00:07:24,696
Grey.

67
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:28,241
You said green men.
A Reticulan skin tone is actually grey.

68
00:07:28,366 --> 00:07:32,370
They're notorious for their extraction
of terrestrial human livers...

69
00:07:32,495 --> 00:07:35,165
...due to iron depletion
in the Reticulan galaxy.

70
00:07:35,248 --> 00:07:36,625
You can't be serious!

71
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:40,128
Do you have any idea what
liver and onions go for on Reticula?

72
00:07:40,211 --> 00:07:41,713
Excuse me.

73
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:50,180
Dana, I've been thinking about this
and I have a theory.

74
00:07:50,263 --> 00:07:52,849
It might explain a lot.
Tell me what you think.

75
00:07:52,932 --> 00:07:55,226
What if the guy enters the building...

76
00:08:09,866 --> 00:08:12,535
Hold on a second.
What in the hell is he doing?

77
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:19,459
Uh, that vent is 6 inches by about 18.

78
00:08:19,584 --> 00:08:24,214
Even if a Reticulan could crawl through,
it's screwed in place.

79
00:08:31,304 --> 00:08:34,599
This is the print
I took from Usher's office.

80
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:37,435
These others are from an X-File.

81
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,272
Ten murders, Baltimore area,
undetermined points of entry.

82
00:08:41,398 --> 00:08:43,608
Each victim had their liver removed.

83
00:08:43,692 --> 00:08:46,611
These prints were found
at 5 of the 10 crime scenes.

84
00:08:46,736 --> 00:08:51,658
- Ten murders. Colton never mentioned...
- Most likely he's unaware of them.

85
00:08:51,783 --> 00:08:56,663
These two prints were lifted five years
before he was born at Powhattan Mill.

86
00:08:56,788 --> 00:09:02,669
And these three were lifted probably
five years before his mother was even born.

87
00:09:02,836 --> 00:09:06,631
Are you saying these prints
are from the 1960s and the 1930s?

88
00:09:06,756 --> 00:09:12,470
Fingerprinting was just starting in 1903, but
there was a murder with an extracted liver.

89
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:13,847
Of course.

90
00:09:13,972 --> 00:09:19,144
Now, that's five murders every 30 years.
That makes two more to go this year.

91
00:09:19,269 --> 00:09:21,312
You're saying these are copycats?

92
00:09:21,438 --> 00:09:23,898
What did we learn our first day
at the Academy?

93
00:09:23,982 --> 00:09:27,444
Each fingerprint is unique.
These are a perfect match.

94
00:09:27,527 --> 00:09:30,947
Are you suggesting I go before
the Violent Crimes Section...

95
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:34,909
...and present a profile saying
these murders are done by aliens?

96
00:09:34,993 --> 00:09:37,495
No! I find no evidence of alien involvement.

97
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,915
What, then? This is the work
of a 100-year-old serial killer...

98
00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:43,835
...who overpowered
a six-foot-two businessman?

99
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:46,546
He'll stick out in a crowd
with ten-inch fingers!

100
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:49,632
Look, bottom line.

101
00:09:49,716 --> 00:09:51,801
This is Colton's case.

102
00:09:51,885 --> 00:09:54,971
Our X-File dates back to 1903.
We had it first.

103
00:09:55,054 --> 00:10:00,185
Mulder, they don't want you involved.
They don't want to hear your theories.

104
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:03,313
That's why Blevins
has you hidden away down here.

105
00:10:03,396 --> 00:10:04,856
You're down here, too.

106
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:07,066
Look, why don't we agree to this?

107
00:10:07,192 --> 00:10:11,362
They have their investigation, we have ours.
And never the twain shall meet.

108
00:10:13,156 --> 00:10:14,657
Agreed?

109
00:10:19,537 --> 00:10:24,542
<i>After a careful review of the violent</i>
<i>and powerful nature of these murders...</i>

110
00:10:24,667 --> 00:10:30,882
<i>..I believe the killer to be a male, 25-35 years</i>
<i>of age, with above average intelligence.</i>

111
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:35,178
<i>His manner of entry</i>
<i>has so far been undetectable.</i>

112
00:10:35,261 --> 00:10:37,639
<i>This may be due to his knowledge</i>

113
00:10:37,722 --> 00:10:40,975
<i>of the inner structure</i>
<i>of buildings and duct works.</i>

114
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:47,065
<i>Or that he in fact hides in plain sight</i>
<i>posing as delivery or maintenance workers.</i>

115
00:10:59,077 --> 00:11:03,665
<i>The extraction of the liver is the most</i>
<i>significant detail of these crimes.</i>

116
00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:08,962
<i>The liver possesses regenerative qualities.</i>
<i>It cleanses the blood.</i>

117
00:11:09,629 --> 00:11:13,633
The taking of this trophy
is the transferring act for the killer to...

118
00:11:13,758 --> 00:11:16,302
...cleanse himself of his own impurities.

119
00:11:16,427 --> 00:11:22,267
I think he is acting under the classic form
of obsessive-compulsive behaviour.

120
00:11:22,934 --> 00:11:27,146
Since the victims are unrelated
and we cannot predict who will be next...

121
00:11:27,272 --> 00:11:31,442
...we must use the fact that a killer
won't always succeed in finding a victim.

122
00:11:31,568 --> 00:11:33,403
When this occurs...

123
00:11:33,486 --> 00:11:37,282
...a serial killer may return to
the site of a previous murder...

124
00:11:37,407 --> 00:11:40,451
...hoping to recapture the emotional high.

125
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:45,582
I think our best course of action
is to target these sites.

126
00:11:45,665 --> 00:11:47,792
Good job, Agent Scully.

127
00:11:47,917 --> 00:11:52,463
If there are no objections, we'll begin
our stakeouts of the murder sites tonight.

128
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:56,759
We're looking for a male, 25-35,
possibly wearing a uniform.

129
00:11:56,843 --> 00:12:01,306
Gas company, UPS, whatever. I know
you're assigned to another area, Scully...

130
00:12:01,431 --> 00:12:04,726
...but you're welcome
to come aboard with us on this.

131
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:09,105
That is if you don't mind working in an area
that's a bit more down to earth.

132
00:12:25,622 --> 00:12:27,916
<i>Position ten. Station check.</i>

133
00:12:27,999 --> 00:12:30,126
Position ten, I copy.

134
00:12:58,196 --> 00:13:01,115
You wouldn't shoot an unarmed man,
would you, copper?

135
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:04,327
- Mulder, what are you doing here?
- He's not coming back.

136
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:08,665
His thrill comes from the challenge
of a seemingly impossible entry.

137
00:13:08,748 --> 00:13:12,085
If you'd read the X-File,
you'd come to the same conclusion.

138
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:15,672
- Mulder, you are jeopardising my stakeout.
- Seeds?

139
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:18,174
You're wasting your time.

140
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:20,218
I'm going home!

141
00:13:53,209 --> 00:13:56,087
Scully! Call for backup and get over here!

142
00:13:58,464 --> 00:14:00,925
Position ten requesting backup!

143
00:14:06,806 --> 00:14:08,433
In there.

144
00:14:16,941 --> 00:14:18,568
Federal Agent!

145
00:14:19,444 --> 00:14:21,320
I'm armed!

146
00:14:22,447 --> 00:14:25,450
Proceed down the vent. Slowly!

147
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:37,170
<i>Cover down to the corner!</i>

148
00:14:37,295 --> 00:14:38,838
<i>She's not by her car!</i>

149
00:14:46,596 --> 00:14:48,973
- Take him!
- Move! Move! Move!

150
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:53,019
FBI. Don't move! Don't move!
Get your hands up! Keep 'em up!

151
00:14:53,311 --> 00:14:56,898
You're under arrest.
You have the right to remain silent...

152
00:14:56,981 --> 00:14:59,025
You were right.

153
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:02,695
You have a right to have
an attorney present during questioning.

154
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,990
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed for you.

155
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:10,870
Is your full name Eugene Victor Tooms?

156
00:15:13,206 --> 00:15:14,624
Yes.

157
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:18,503
Are you a resident of the state of Maryland?

158
00:15:19,712 --> 00:15:21,172
Yes.

159
00:15:22,173 --> 00:15:26,636
Are you an employee
of the Baltimore Municipal Animal Control?

160
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:29,138
Yes.

161
00:15:29,722 --> 00:15:33,684
Is it your intent to lie to me
about anything here today?

162
00:15:35,228 --> 00:15:36,395
No.

163
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,857
Were you ever enrolled in college?

164
00:15:41,526 --> 00:15:42,860
<i>Yes.</i>

165
00:15:43,402 --> 00:15:46,322
<i>Were you ever enrolled in medical school?</i>

166
00:15:47,698 --> 00:15:48,908
<i>No.</i>

167
00:15:49,367 --> 00:15:52,370
<i>Have you ever removed a liver</i>
<i>from a human being?</i>

168
00:15:54,205 --> 00:15:55,581
No.

169
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:58,876
Have you ever killed a living creature?

170
00:16:02,046 --> 00:16:03,756
Yes.

171
00:16:03,881 --> 00:16:07,051
Have you ever killed a human being?

172
00:16:08,052 --> 00:16:09,887
No.

173
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:13,558
Were you ever in George Usher's office?

174
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:16,060
No.

175
00:16:16,602 --> 00:16:18,938
Did you kill George Usher?

176
00:16:20,398 --> 00:16:21,941
No.

177
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,361
Are you over 100 years old?

178
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:28,531
- That must be a control question.
- I had her ask it.

179
00:16:29,448 --> 00:16:30,950
No.

180
00:16:32,743 --> 00:16:35,580
Have you ever been to Powhattan Mill?

181
00:16:35,872 --> 00:16:37,123
Yes.

182
00:16:37,248 --> 00:16:38,791
In 1933?

183
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:44,589
No.

184
00:16:45,923 --> 00:16:48,885
Are you afraid you might fail this test?

185
00:16:50,136 --> 00:16:51,929
Well...

186
00:16:53,139 --> 00:16:57,560
Yes. Because I didn't do anything.

187
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:00,271
He nailed it... A+.

188
00:17:00,396 --> 00:17:04,442
As far as I'm concerned,
the subject did not kill those two people.

189
00:17:09,238 --> 00:17:13,492
Maintenance at the office building
confirmed the call to Animal Control...

190
00:17:13,618 --> 00:17:18,247
...about a bad smell. They found a dead cat
in the second floor ventilation ducts.

191
00:17:18,331 --> 00:17:21,626
Still doesn't explain why he was there
that late at night.

192
00:17:21,751 --> 00:17:25,046
He's a civil servant with initiative
and we busted him for it.

193
00:17:25,129 --> 00:17:29,133
He was crawling up an air duct,
by himself, without alerting security.

194
00:17:29,258 --> 00:17:30,885
Dana, he passed the test.

195
00:17:30,968 --> 00:17:35,389
His story checks out. He's not the guy.
It doesn't mean your profile's incorrect.

196
00:17:35,473 --> 00:17:37,808
Scully's right. It is the guy.

197
00:17:37,934 --> 00:17:40,853
What have you got, Mulder?

198
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:43,105
He lied on questions 11 and 13.

199
00:17:43,189 --> 00:17:47,109
His electrodermal and cardiographic
response nearly go off the chart.

200
00:17:47,193 --> 00:17:50,529
Is number 11 the 100-year-old question?

201
00:17:52,365 --> 00:17:55,201
Well, I had a reaction
to that stupid question.

202
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:57,203
And what is this Powhattan Mill thing?

203
00:17:57,328 --> 00:18:02,708
Two murders with matching MOs occurred
in Powhattan Mill in 1933. Look at the chart.

204
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,460
My interpretation of those reactions...

205
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:08,798
I don't need you or that machine
telling me if Tooms was alive in '33!

206
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:10,883
He's the guy.

207
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:13,678
I'm letting him go.

208
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:18,474
You coming?

209
00:18:19,684 --> 00:18:23,604
Tom, I want to thank you for letting me
put in some time with the VCS.

210
00:18:23,688 --> 00:18:28,317
- But I am officially assigned to the X-Files.
- I'll see what I can do about that.

211
00:18:28,401 --> 00:18:30,653
Tom, I can look out for myself.

212
00:18:30,736 --> 00:18:32,863
You said Mulder was out there.

213
00:18:33,197 --> 00:18:35,241
That guy's insane.

214
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,960
You knew they wouldn't believe you.
Why did you push it?

215
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:48,838
Maybe I thought you caught the right guy.

216
00:18:49,922 --> 00:18:52,800
And maybe I run into so many people
who are hostile...

217
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:56,345
...because they can't open their minds
to the possibilities...

218
00:18:56,429 --> 00:18:59,473
...that sometimes
the need to mess with their heads...

219
00:18:59,557 --> 00:19:02,852
...outweighs the millstone of humiliation.

220
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:06,439
It seems like you were acting
very territorial.

221
00:19:06,564 --> 00:19:08,691
- I don't know...
- Of course I was.

222
00:19:08,774 --> 00:19:12,153
In our investigations,
you may not always agree with me...

223
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:14,739
...but at least you respect the journey.

224
00:19:14,864 --> 00:19:19,869
And if you want to continue working
with them, I won't hold it against you.

225
00:19:23,581 --> 00:19:28,544
I don't know. You must have something
more than your polygraph interpretation...

226
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:32,757
...to back up this bizarre theory
and I have to see what it is.

227
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,929
These are Eugene Tooms's prints.

228
00:19:44,226 --> 00:19:48,105
This is the fingerprint
they took from Usher's office.

229
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:50,900
It matches the old ones from the X-Files.

230
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:52,735
Obviously no match.

231
00:19:53,569 --> 00:19:55,071
What if...

232
00:19:55,154 --> 00:19:57,281
...somehow...

233
00:20:11,337 --> 00:20:12,963
How could that be?

234
00:20:13,089 --> 00:20:16,926
The only thing I know for certain is...
they let him go.

235
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:15,187
Ahh! Agh!

236
00:23:28,826 --> 00:23:30,744
64 inches from the south wall.

237
00:23:30,828 --> 00:23:34,164
Let's check on liver transplants
in the next 24 hours.

238
00:23:34,290 --> 00:23:37,751
- Maybe this is black market.
- Come on! It was ripped outta there.

239
00:23:37,835 --> 00:23:41,589
Look, at this point I'm willing
to give any theory a shot!

240
00:23:41,672 --> 00:23:46,969
Any sane theory. Dana, I only want qualified
members of the team at the crime scene.

241
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:50,889
What's the matter?
You worried I'm going to solve your case?

242
00:23:51,015 --> 00:23:55,394
Tom, we have authorised access
to this crime scene.

243
00:23:56,353 --> 00:24:01,483
A report of you obstructing another officer's
investigation might stick out on your file.

244
00:24:05,654 --> 00:24:08,282
Look, Dana, whose side are you on?

245
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:09,658
The victim's.

246
00:24:15,706 --> 00:24:18,208
105 inches from the fireplace.

247
00:24:24,048 --> 00:24:26,800
The victim is a Thomas Werner,
single, white...

248
00:24:26,884 --> 00:24:28,260
It's Tooms.

249
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:32,723
And he took something.

250
00:24:48,072 --> 00:24:51,784
Baltimore PD checked out
Tooms's apartment. It was a cover.

251
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:56,413
No one has ever lived there <i>and</i> he hasn't
shown up for work since the arrest.

252
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:58,290
I found him.

253
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:01,251
How do we learn about the present?
We look to the past.

254
00:25:01,377 --> 00:25:05,339
I think this is where it all began
in 1903, on Exeter Street.

255
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:08,384
Look at the address
of that first murder in 1903.

256
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:13,597
Apartment 203.

257
00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:16,684
He killed the guy above him.

258
00:25:16,767 --> 00:25:18,936
Maybe he played the Victrola too loud.

259
00:25:19,061 --> 00:25:22,773
- This must be Tooms's great-grandfather.
- What about the prints?

260
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:24,858
Genetics might explain the patterns.

261
00:25:24,942 --> 00:25:28,487
It also might explain
the sociopathic attitudes and behaviours.

262
00:25:28,612 --> 00:25:30,406
It begins with one family member

263
00:25:30,489 --> 00:25:33,450
who raises an offspring
who raises the next child...

264
00:25:33,575 --> 00:25:35,536
What is this? The Anti-Waltons?

265
00:25:35,619 --> 00:25:37,287
What do you think?

266
00:25:37,413 --> 00:25:41,667
I think we have to track Eugene Tooms.
There's four down and one to go this year.

267
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:44,962
If we don't get him right now,
the next chance will be in...

268
00:25:45,087 --> 00:25:46,088
2023.

269
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:49,800
You'll be head of the Bureau by then.
You go through the census.

270
00:25:49,925 --> 00:25:54,972
I'll plough through this century's
marriage, birth, death certificates and...

271
00:25:55,097 --> 00:25:58,767
Do you have any Dramamine on you?
These things make me seasick.

272
00:26:28,881 --> 00:26:30,966
- Anything?
- Nope.

273
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:34,386
He disappeared off the face of the earth.
You?

274
00:26:35,012 --> 00:26:38,515
Never was born. Never married. Never died.

275
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:40,851
At least in Baltimore County.

276
00:26:41,852 --> 00:26:43,896
Oh, I did find one thing, though.

277
00:26:44,354 --> 00:26:46,982
It's the current address
of the investigating officer

278
00:26:47,065 --> 00:26:49,526
of the Powhattan Mill murders in 1933.

279
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:54,656
I've been waiting 25 years for you.

280
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:56,575
Sir?

281
00:26:56,700 --> 00:27:00,120
I called it quits in 1968...

282
00:27:00,204 --> 00:27:03,207
...after 45 years as a cop.

283
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:07,544
And those killings at Powhattan Mill...

284
00:27:09,171 --> 00:27:12,716
I was a sheriff then
and I'd seen my share of murders.

285
00:27:14,009 --> 00:27:16,053
Bloody ones.

286
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,014
But I could go home and...

287
00:27:20,349 --> 00:27:24,436
...pitch a few baseballs to my kid
and never give it a second thought.

288
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:29,358
You gotta be able to do that.
You... you'd go crazy, right?

289
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:33,612
But those murders in Powhattan Mill...

290
00:27:35,572 --> 00:27:39,910
When I walked into that room,
my heart went cold.

291
00:27:41,245 --> 00:27:44,373
My hands... numbed.

292
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:48,252
I could feel...

293
00:27:49,253 --> 00:27:50,712
...it!

294
00:27:50,796 --> 00:27:52,923
Feel what, Frank?

295
00:27:55,717 --> 00:28:00,430
When I first heard about
the death camps in 1945...

296
00:28:01,098 --> 00:28:03,267
...I remembered Powhattan Mill.

297
00:28:04,393 --> 00:28:07,312
And I see the Kurds and the Bosnians.

298
00:28:08,272 --> 00:28:10,899
That room is there, I tell you.

299
00:28:10,983 --> 00:28:15,946
It's like all the horrible acts
that humans are capable of...

300
00:28:16,071 --> 00:28:20,158
...somehow gave birth to some kind of...

301
00:28:20,742 --> 00:28:23,787
...human monster.

302
00:28:25,747 --> 00:28:28,917
That's why I say
I've been waiting for you.

303
00:28:29,001 --> 00:28:30,961
Uh...

304
00:28:31,795 --> 00:28:35,799
There's a box in the trunk here.
Get it for me, would you, please?

305
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,978
Now, <i>this</i> is all the evidence I've collected.

306
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:52,357
- Officially and unofficially.
- Unofficially?

307
00:28:52,482 --> 00:28:58,655
I knew that the murders in '63
were by the same... person as in '33.

308
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:02,492
But by then they had me
on a desk pushing papers...

309
00:29:02,618 --> 00:29:05,621
...and they wouldn't let me
anywhere near the case.

310
00:29:05,704 --> 00:29:08,290
- A piece of the removed liver?
- Yes.

311
00:29:08,373 --> 00:29:12,336
But, you know, that's not
the only trophy he took with him.

312
00:29:12,461 --> 00:29:18,050
Family members reported small
personal effects missing in each case.

313
00:29:18,175 --> 00:29:22,471
A hairbrush in the Walters murder.
A coffee mug in the Taylor murder.

314
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:27,351
Have you ever heard
the name Eugene Victor Tooms?

315
00:29:27,476 --> 00:29:33,231
When they wouldn't bring me aboard in '63,
I... I did some of my own work.

316
00:29:33,357 --> 00:29:35,525
I took these surveillance pictures.

317
00:29:36,318 --> 00:29:37,986
This...

318
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,572
...is Tooms.

319
00:29:43,158 --> 00:29:46,161
Of course, that was him 30 years ago.

320
00:29:47,204 --> 00:29:49,539
And this...

321
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:53,168
...is the apartment where he lived.

322
00:29:54,044 --> 00:29:56,838
- It was located at...
- 66 Exeter Street?

323
00:29:56,922 --> 00:29:58,674
Right.

324
00:29:58,757 --> 00:30:01,301
That's it. Right there.

325
00:30:33,375 --> 00:30:35,419
Here's 103.

326
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:50,475
The old man was right.

327
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:52,644
You can feel it.

328
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:09,828
There's nothing here.

329
00:31:14,249 --> 00:31:16,501
Check this out.

330
00:31:17,961 --> 00:31:20,088
What's down here?

331
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:25,802
I don't know.

332
00:31:28,638 --> 00:31:30,682
Let's find out.

333
00:31:52,662 --> 00:31:54,998
Just an old coal cellar.

334
00:32:06,676 --> 00:32:10,055
Somebody having a garage sale?

335
00:32:23,235 --> 00:32:28,865
- This is the shape on Werner's mantel.
- Frank said he collected trophies.

336
00:32:32,744 --> 00:32:37,165
- Does he live in here?
- It looks like the wall's deteriorating.

337
00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:39,709
No. Somebody made it.

338
00:32:45,715 --> 00:32:47,801
This is a nest.

339
00:32:47,884 --> 00:32:49,219
Look.

340
00:32:49,344 --> 00:32:51,888
It's made out of rags and newspapers.

341
00:32:52,013 --> 00:32:56,393
This looks like the opening.
Think there's anything inside?

342
00:32:56,852 --> 00:32:59,479
Oh, my God, Mulder. It smells like...

343
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:03,358
I think it's bile.

344
00:33:03,441 --> 00:33:09,364
Is there any way I can get it off my fingers
quickly without betraying my cool exterior?

345
00:33:10,574 --> 00:33:14,578
- No one could live in this.
- I don't think it's where he lives.

346
00:33:14,703 --> 00:33:17,205
I think it's where he hibernates.

347
00:33:18,582 --> 00:33:20,709
- Hibernates?
- Just listen.

348
00:33:21,918 --> 00:33:23,712
What if some genetic mutation

349
00:33:23,795 --> 00:33:26,673
could allow a man to awaken
every 30 years?

350
00:33:26,756 --> 00:33:28,341
Mulder...

351
00:33:28,425 --> 00:33:33,013
And what if the five livers could provide him
sustenance for that period?

352
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:38,268
What if Tooms is some kind of
20th century... genetic mutant?

353
00:33:39,144 --> 00:33:43,190
In any case, he's not here now
and he's gotta come back.

354
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:47,194
- We'll need a surveillance team.
- That'll take some finagling.

355
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:51,406
You go downtown and see what
you can finagle and I'll keep watch.

356
00:34:03,627 --> 00:34:06,129
Oh, wait. I'm snagged on something.

357
00:34:07,297 --> 00:34:10,258
Oh, it's OK. I got it.

358
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:33,782
It's about time.

359
00:34:33,865 --> 00:34:36,326
So... who we looking for again?

360
00:34:36,451 --> 00:34:39,579
Eugene Tooms. He's unarmed
but consider him dangerous.

361
00:34:39,663 --> 00:34:42,916
Scully and I will be back to relieve you
in eight hours if he doesn't show.

362
00:34:42,999 --> 00:34:44,584
Right here.

363
00:34:44,668 --> 00:34:46,836
You got it... Spooky.

364
00:34:52,467 --> 00:34:54,511
We have to talk.

365
00:34:54,636 --> 00:34:57,305
- I have to meet Mulder.
- That's why we have to talk.

366
00:34:57,389 --> 00:35:01,351
You're using two of my men
to sit in front of a condemned building!

367
00:35:01,476 --> 00:35:04,354
It isn't interfering with your investigation.

368
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:08,525
When we had lunch, I looked forward
to working with you. You are a good agent.

369
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:11,528
But, after Mulder,
I couldn't have you far enough away.

370
00:35:11,653 --> 00:35:14,322
Don't go down there.
I had the stakeout called off.

371
00:35:14,406 --> 00:35:15,699
You can't do that!

372
00:35:15,824 --> 00:35:17,951
No, I can't! But my Regional ASA did it

373
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:20,328
once I told him
about the waste in man-hours.

374
00:35:20,412 --> 00:35:24,082
Uh-uh. Let me call Mulder.
Let me tell him the news.

375
00:35:24,207 --> 00:35:27,585
Is this what it takes
to climb the ladder, Colton?

376
00:35:27,711 --> 00:35:29,587
All the way to the top.

377
00:35:29,713 --> 00:35:34,009
Then I can't wait till you fall off
and land on your ass.

378
00:35:40,557 --> 00:35:44,185
<i>This is Fox Mulder.</i>
<i>I'm not here. Leave a message.</i>

379
00:36:13,465 --> 00:36:15,550
Where is everyone?

380
00:36:15,633 --> 00:36:17,260
Scully?

381
00:36:28,104 --> 00:36:31,399
<i>This is Fox Mulder.</i>
<i>I'm not here. Leave a message.</i>

382
00:36:31,483 --> 00:36:35,236
Mulder, you must have gone out
since Colton gave us the night off.

383
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:39,449
What say we file a complaint against him?
I am furious!

384
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:44,662
Call me when you get in. OK, bye.

385
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:14,943
Dammit!

386
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:51,312
Dammit, answer!

387
00:38:12,667 --> 00:38:13,710
Ahh!

388
00:38:38,735 --> 00:38:40,236
Scully!

389
00:39:00,590 --> 00:39:02,383
Are you all right?

390
00:39:09,807 --> 00:39:12,602
He's not gonna get his quota this year.

391
00:40:24,215 --> 00:40:27,635
Look at him.
He's building another nest.

392
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:31,806
You'll be interested to know
that I've ordered some genetic tests.

393
00:40:31,889 --> 00:40:37,061
The preliminary medical exam
revealed quite abnormal development...

394
00:40:37,186 --> 00:40:39,439
...in the muscular and skeletal systems.

395
00:40:39,522 --> 00:40:42,692
As well as a continually
declining metabolic rate.

396
00:40:42,817 --> 00:40:46,863
It dips way below the levels
registered in deep sleep.

397
00:40:47,739 --> 00:40:49,490
Did you hear me, Mulder?

398
00:40:49,574 --> 00:40:53,161
All these people putting bars
on their windows.

399
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:58,082
Spending good money on hi-tech
security systems trying to feel safe.

400
00:40:58,207 --> 00:41:00,335
I look at this guy and I think...

401
00:41:02,045 --> 00:41:04,172
...it ain't enough.

402
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:30,758
Claire Bates

403
00:42:42,145 --> 00:42:43,980
<i>I made this!</i>
