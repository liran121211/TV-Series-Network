1
00:01:26,713 --> 00:01:31,093
We're not... who... we are.

2
00:01:36,765 --> 00:01:40,102
We're not... who... we are.

3
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:46,817
It goes no further than this.

4
00:01:50,487 --> 00:01:52,572
It stops right here...

5
00:01:53,657 --> 00:01:55,742
...right now.

6
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,669
<i>Team Captain John Richter here.</i>

7
00:04:10,752 --> 00:04:13,255
<i>It's been a couple of frustrating months.</i>

8
00:04:13,338 --> 00:04:18,510
<i>But after a lot of stick-with-it-ness, we're</i>
<i>proud to report that half an hour ago...</i>

9
00:04:18,593 --> 00:04:22,597
<i>.. we broke the previous record</i>
<i>for drilling down into an ice sheet.</i>

10
00:04:24,558 --> 00:04:28,520
This team of scientists
made up the Arctic Ice Core Project.

11
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:33,358
They were sent to Alaska by the Advanced
Research Project Agency a year ago...

12
00:04:33,442 --> 00:04:35,402
...to drill into the arctic ice.

13
00:04:36,027 --> 00:04:37,904
The samples they removed...

14
00:04:37,988 --> 00:04:41,491
...contained trapped gases, dust, chemicals.

15
00:04:41,575 --> 00:04:46,413
They could reveal the structure of the
Earth's climate back to the dawn of man.

16
00:04:46,496 --> 00:04:49,082
Their work was a success,
nearly completed.

17
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:53,170
No reports or indications
of problems of any kind.

18
00:04:53,253 --> 00:04:56,381
Until, only a week later,
this next transmission.

19
00:05:02,762 --> 00:05:06,933
<i>We're not... who... we are.</i>

20
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:16,776
<i>We're not... who... we are.</i>

21
00:05:19,446 --> 00:05:21,990
<i>It goes no further than this.</i>

22
00:05:23,575 --> 00:05:26,828
<i>It stops... right here...</i>

23
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:30,081
<i>..right now.</i>

24
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,005
What happened up there?

25
00:05:37,088 --> 00:05:41,259
So far nobody's been able to reach
the compound because of bad weather.

26
00:05:41,343 --> 00:05:44,429
Obviously we must be
brilliant or expendable

27
00:05:44,513 --> 00:05:46,598
because we've pulled the assignment.

28
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:48,767
It is severe isolation distress?

29
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:54,231
These were top geophysicists, trained
and screened for this project in every way...

30
00:05:54,314 --> 00:05:56,733
...including psychological makeup.

31
00:05:56,816 --> 00:05:58,151
We leave for Nome today.

32
00:05:58,235 --> 00:06:02,113
We'll join three scientists
familiar with the Ice Core Project...

33
00:06:02,197 --> 00:06:05,450
...and then head north up to the Icy Cape.

34
00:06:05,534 --> 00:06:07,869
The National Weather Service
gives us three days to get in and out

35
00:06:07,953 --> 00:06:10,247
before the next storm.

36
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:12,916
Bring your mittens.

37
00:06:23,718 --> 00:06:28,974
<i>Here's the snap. Fouts</i>
<i>dumps it across to Winslow! Touchdown!</i>

38
00:06:29,057 --> 00:06:31,935
Touchdown! Fouts... is... God!

39
00:06:35,313 --> 00:06:37,399
Sorry. My team scored.

40
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:39,734
There's no football on Wednesdays.

41
00:06:39,818 --> 00:06:41,903
Fouts retired in '87, didn't he?

42
00:06:41,987 --> 00:06:45,323
No, this is just
my all-time favourite plays on tape.

43
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:50,412
- You two FBI?
- Agent Mulder, Agent Scully. And you?

44
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:53,164
Denny Murphy.
Professor of Geology, UC San Diego.

45
00:06:53,248 --> 00:06:56,334
San Diego? Get much chance
to study ice down there?

46
00:06:56,418 --> 00:06:57,919
Just what's around the cake.

47
00:07:00,338 --> 00:07:02,424
Dr Da Silva? Dr Hodge?

48
00:07:02,507 --> 00:07:04,593
Yeah. Sorry we're late.

49
00:07:04,676 --> 00:07:07,304
Agents Scully and Mulder.
Professor Murphy.

50
00:07:07,387 --> 00:07:09,306
Can I see some identification?

51
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:13,351
- What for?
- I wanna make sure we are who we say.

52
00:07:17,314 --> 00:07:19,190
That's me.

53
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:22,402
It's you.

54
00:07:22,485 --> 00:07:24,362
- That's me.
- Thanks a lot.

55
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:32,495
Well, now that we know who we are,
anybody care to guess why we're going?

56
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:39,169
Two federal agents, a geologist,
a doctor and a toxicologist.

57
00:07:39,252 --> 00:07:40,837
That should give us some idea.

58
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,882
I assume you all took a look at the tape.

59
00:07:46,468 --> 00:07:49,179
- Something wrong?
- Come on. You're FBI.

60
00:07:49,262 --> 00:07:51,348
You have to know more than we do.

61
00:07:59,272 --> 00:08:01,650
You folks the ones goin' up to Icy Cape?

62
00:08:01,733 --> 00:08:04,944
- Yeah.
- Then I'm the one flyin' you.

63
00:08:05,028 --> 00:08:10,200
My name's Bear. The plane's across the
way. Provisions are loaded. Grab your gear.

64
00:08:10,283 --> 00:08:12,369
Can we see some credentials?

65
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:16,456
Credentials?

66
00:08:16,539 --> 00:08:21,586
The only credentials I have is that
I'm the only pilot willing to fly you up there.

67
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:24,214
You don't like those credentials...

68
00:08:24,297 --> 00:08:26,383
...walk.

69
00:08:55,036 --> 00:08:57,747
Bear, see if you can get the power started.

70
00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:01,584
Anything to get out of here.

71
00:09:06,548 --> 00:09:08,633
Where do we start?

72
00:09:08,717 --> 00:09:10,802
The body bags are on the plane.

73
00:09:10,885 --> 00:09:15,306
Before we touch anything, we have to
thoroughly document the scene.

74
00:09:24,983 --> 00:09:26,651
Flashing.

75
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:43,793
That's what they were drilling for.

76
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,799
A quarter of a million years
melting away in a couple of days.

77
00:09:49,883 --> 00:09:51,968
I'm gonna preserve some samples.

78
00:10:14,991 --> 00:10:17,076
- It's the generator.
- Oh.

79
00:10:29,714 --> 00:10:31,257
Agent Mulder!

80
00:10:43,728 --> 00:10:44,896
Hold on!

81
00:10:52,654 --> 00:10:54,155
Hold it down!

82
00:11:02,789 --> 00:11:05,583
That ought to
keep him out for a while.

83
00:11:09,671 --> 00:11:12,549
- Are you OK?
- Yeah. He didn't break the skin.

84
00:11:12,632 --> 00:11:14,717
- Bear? Are you OK?
- He got me.

85
00:11:14,801 --> 00:11:18,847
- Get that jacket off.
- Just gimme the stuff. I'll do it myself.

86
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:22,100
Is it rabies?

87
00:11:27,313 --> 00:11:31,568
I don't see any indication
of glottal spasm or tetany.

88
00:11:31,651 --> 00:11:35,280
If it is rabies, it's not a strain
I'm familiar with.

89
00:11:35,363 --> 00:11:37,866
Look at this. Black nodules.

90
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:39,617
Swollen lymph nodes.

91
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:42,036
Symptoms of bubonic plague.

92
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:45,164
We'll do a blood test.
We'll take it from there.

93
00:11:45,248 --> 00:11:47,584
This dog...

94
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:50,461
...has got a skin irritation round its neck.

95
00:11:50,545 --> 00:11:53,798
Looks like it's been
scratching off its own hair.

96
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:57,427
Look at this. Look at this!

97
00:12:00,805 --> 00:12:03,933
What... the hell... was that?

98
00:12:14,652 --> 00:12:16,738
Agh! Oh...

99
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:51,064
From the autopsies, it's clear
these men killed one another.

100
00:12:51,147 --> 00:12:54,901
There are contusions around
the throat areas of three men...

101
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:57,111
...evidence of strangulation.

102
00:12:57,195 --> 00:12:59,906
Richter and Campbell killed themselves.

103
00:12:59,989 --> 00:13:02,533
I also found tissue damage due to fever.

104
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:06,245
Did any of them have
the black spots the dog has?

105
00:13:06,329 --> 00:13:09,290
No. None of them had the black nodules.

106
00:13:09,374 --> 00:13:14,837
So... those spots didn't have anything to do
with those guys killin' each other, right?

107
00:13:14,921 --> 00:13:18,049
I wouldn't rule it out.
I just re-examined the dog.

108
00:13:18,132 --> 00:13:21,552
- The nodules are gone.
- What could that mean?

109
00:13:21,636 --> 00:13:26,140
It could mean the spots are a symptom
of some disease at an early stage.

110
00:13:56,504 --> 00:13:57,964
Denny?

111
00:13:58,047 --> 00:13:59,716
Denny.

112
00:14:01,801 --> 00:14:03,469
Denny. Sorry.

113
00:14:03,553 --> 00:14:05,972
The play-off game against Miami, '82.

114
00:14:06,055 --> 00:14:08,141
Helps me get my mind off stuff.

115
00:14:08,224 --> 00:14:13,396
My interpretation of satellite
remote sensing photos is a little rusty.

116
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:15,565
All right. This is the Icy Cape area.

117
00:14:15,648 --> 00:14:20,862
It approximates the depth of the ice sheet
to be about... 3,000 metres thick.

118
00:14:20,945 --> 00:14:23,031
I also found this data.

119
00:14:23,114 --> 00:14:28,327
If I'm reading it correctly, the team actually
found the ice sheet to be twice that depth.

120
00:14:28,411 --> 00:14:32,582
That's very good. The numbers indicate
the topography to be concave.

121
00:14:32,665 --> 00:14:35,835
Looks like they were drilling
inside a meteor crater.

122
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:38,004
No, it's impossible.

123
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:40,965
- I analysed two samples.
- What did you find?

124
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:45,428
There seems to be a presence of
ammonium hydroxide in Richter's blood.

125
00:14:45,511 --> 00:14:49,849
It's not possible. Ammonia would
vaporise at human body temperature.

126
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:52,518
I checked all the air filtration systems.

127
00:14:52,602 --> 00:14:55,563
- I found no evidence of any such toxins.
- I have.

128
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:58,191
In the ice.

129
00:14:58,274 --> 00:14:59,942
And that's not all there is.

130
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:07,575
I found a high ratio of
ammonia to water in the ice core.

131
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:10,203
The Earth's atmosphere couldn't do that,

132
00:15:10,286 --> 00:15:12,955
not even ¼ million years ago.
Look in the scope.

133
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:17,168
Unless a foreign object
was introduced into that environment.

134
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:20,129
Tell me <i>that's</i> not a foreign object.

135
00:15:20,213 --> 00:15:22,090
Oh! Scully.

136
00:15:25,635 --> 00:15:28,054
That same thing is in Richter's blood!

137
00:15:30,306 --> 00:15:35,436
What if that single-celled organism
is the larval stage of a larger animal?

138
00:15:37,814 --> 00:15:40,274
That's kind of a leap, don't you think?

139
00:15:41,275 --> 00:15:43,402
The evidence is there.

140
00:15:43,486 --> 00:15:46,114
Maybe the organism
somehow got into the men.

141
00:15:46,197 --> 00:15:50,284
Nothing can survive in subzero
temperatures for ¼ million years.

142
00:15:50,368 --> 00:15:52,954
Unless that's how it lives.

143
00:15:53,955 --> 00:15:57,416
Lookit, I don't see why
you're squabbling over some bug.

144
00:15:57,500 --> 00:16:00,962
You said your autopsy found
those men killed each other.

145
00:16:01,045 --> 00:16:04,132
That's it. I say let's get the hell out of here.

146
00:16:04,215 --> 00:16:06,467
I agree. We can have the bodies...

147
00:16:06,551 --> 00:16:10,179
...sent to a facility which can
make a definitive diagnosis.

148
00:16:10,263 --> 00:16:13,641
In the event that something
was missed, Agent Scully.

149
00:16:13,724 --> 00:16:17,228
If those bodies are infected,
we can't take them back.

150
00:16:17,311 --> 00:16:20,648
We can't go back without
proper quarantine procedures.

151
00:16:20,731 --> 00:16:22,316
We can't risk bringing back the next plague.

152
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:25,820
Say they did come down with something.

153
00:16:25,903 --> 00:16:28,865
We haven't, and I ain't
waitin' around until we do.

154
00:16:28,948 --> 00:16:33,661
I think it's safe to go back.
There's no reason why we'd be infected.

155
00:16:33,744 --> 00:16:36,914
- We took all the safeguards.
- The dog did bite Bear.

156
00:16:36,998 --> 00:16:40,001
- It jumped Mulder!
- There's only one way to proceed!

157
00:16:40,084 --> 00:16:43,045
A doctor eliminates every possibility.

158
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:46,132
We must determine
if any of us is infected.

159
00:16:50,011 --> 00:16:52,889
All right. Parasitic diagnostic procedure...

160
00:16:52,972 --> 00:16:56,309
...requires us each to provide
a blood and a stool sample.

161
00:16:56,392 --> 00:16:58,561
A stool sample?

162
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:01,814
Travel always makes that
kinda tough... for me.

163
00:17:01,898 --> 00:17:06,277
OK... Anybody got the morning
sports section handy?

164
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:10,865
- I ain't droppin' my cargo for no one.

165
00:17:10,948 --> 00:17:15,536
I'm gettin' my gear, gettin' my plane,
and flyin' the hell outta here!

166
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:18,206
You can't go. The dog bit you.

167
00:17:19,415 --> 00:17:22,501
I got hired to fly you up here
and fly you back!

168
00:17:22,585 --> 00:17:27,089
No one said this might be part
of the deal, so the deal is over.

169
00:17:31,093 --> 00:17:32,929
We can't let him leave.

170
00:17:33,012 --> 00:17:35,598
- Who's gonna stop him?
- We have to.

171
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:38,392
We can't risk infecting the population.

172
00:17:38,476 --> 00:17:40,686
He gets on that plane, I go with him.

173
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:43,356
- We don't have time to argue.
- Take a vote.

174
00:17:43,439 --> 00:17:47,401
Who says we should confine Bear
until he agrees to an examination?

175
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:56,077
All right.

176
00:17:58,496 --> 00:18:00,748
Bear, we just want to check you out.

177
00:18:00,831 --> 00:18:05,461
If we don't find any trace of
the parasite or the virus, we'll all go.

178
00:18:12,385 --> 00:18:14,470
All right.

179
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:16,639
Gimme the damn jar.

180
00:18:30,069 --> 00:18:31,612
Murphy! Get a rope!

181
00:18:37,243 --> 00:18:38,286
Here!

182
00:18:40,913 --> 00:18:42,623
Oh, my God!

183
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:49,547
- Get my bag!
- What are you gonna do?!

184
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,300
- Cut it out.
- We don't know enough about it.

185
00:18:52,383 --> 00:18:55,803
It's killing him!
Scully, help me move the skin.

186
00:18:59,598 --> 00:19:01,934
Hold still, Bear.

187
00:19:05,313 --> 00:19:07,398
Forceps.

188
00:19:12,361 --> 00:19:15,489
Hold still, Bear. One more second.
You're gonna be OK.

189
00:19:42,058 --> 00:19:46,604
This is the AICP investigative team
calling Doolittle Airfield. Come in.

190
00:19:46,687 --> 00:19:48,230
<i>DAF responding.</i>

191
00:19:48,314 --> 00:19:51,942
This is Agent Mulder.
We have a serious biological hazard.

192
00:19:52,026 --> 00:19:55,488
Request air pickup
and quarantine procedures. Over.

193
00:19:55,571 --> 00:19:59,116
Come in, Doolittle Airfield!

194
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,662
<i>We copy, Agent Mulder. We are under</i>
<i>a heavy storm. No aircraft can get out.</i>

195
00:20:03,746 --> 00:20:07,208
<i>The military base in Kotzebue</i>
<i>could set up a quarantine.</i>

196
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:11,212
<i>Advise immediate evacuation.</i>
<i>The storm is heading your way. Over.</i>

197
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:14,757
We were told we'd have
three clear days of weather! Over!

198
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,176
<i>Welcome to the top of the world. Over.</i>

199
00:20:17,259 --> 00:20:22,139
Is Bear in any condition to fly? If we don't
leave in an hour, we're stuck for days.

200
00:20:27,144 --> 00:20:28,771
He's dead.

201
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:51,043
It's similar to a tapeworm.
It has a scolex with suckers and hooks.

202
00:20:51,127 --> 00:20:54,588
So it's familiar.
Something you can deal with.

203
00:20:54,672 --> 00:20:57,258
- What?
- No.

204
00:20:57,341 --> 00:21:01,011
Very different from any organism
at least that <i>I</i> know of.

205
00:21:01,095 --> 00:21:03,889
Have you figured out how it's transmitted?

206
00:21:03,973 --> 00:21:08,018
Exchange of fluids, touch, air?
All of the above? I don't know.

207
00:21:08,102 --> 00:21:12,273
All the other bodies had the creature.
Only this one is still alive.

208
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:14,859
- All in the spine?
- No.

209
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:19,155
It appears they were in
the hypothalamus gland deep in the brain.

210
00:21:19,238 --> 00:21:22,199
Hypothalamus?
What was that again?

211
00:21:22,283 --> 00:21:24,702
It's a gland that secretes hormones.

212
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:29,081
Although... I don't know why a parasite
would want to attach to it.

213
00:21:29,165 --> 00:21:31,792
Hypothalamus releases acetylcholine...

214
00:21:31,876 --> 00:21:35,212
...which produces violent,
aggressive behaviour.

215
00:21:35,296 --> 00:21:37,548
See, that might be the connection.

216
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:42,011
Everybody that's been infected
certainly seems to act aggressively.

217
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:47,308
Maybe the worm feeds on acetylcholine
and stops us controlling violent behaviour.

218
00:21:47,391 --> 00:21:52,521
- A parasite shouldn't want to kill its host.
- It doesn't kill you until it's extracted.

219
00:21:52,605 --> 00:21:54,648
Then it releases a poison.

220
00:21:54,732 --> 00:21:58,611
So you're saying the worm
makes you wanna kill other people.

221
00:21:58,694 --> 00:22:01,655
Which is maybe what happened
to the first team.

222
00:22:01,739 --> 00:22:03,824
Or what could happen to <i>us.</i>

223
00:22:03,908 --> 00:22:08,078
- It's just a theory. We don't have any proof.
- Except five dead men.

224
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:11,290
If the worm makes people
violently aggressive...

225
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:14,543
...why did Richter and Campbell
kill themselves?

226
00:22:14,627 --> 00:22:16,712
Maybe they did it to save <i>us.</i>

227
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:39,235
I'm just... uh... double-checking.
Making sure I didn't miss anything.

228
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:41,403
Just some sleep, right?

229
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:45,157
Sleep? I'm so tired, I can't sleep.

230
00:22:45,241 --> 00:22:50,287
We're all wired and hypersensitive.
It'll be good to get a fresh start tomorrow.

231
00:22:50,371 --> 00:22:54,625
Mulder, I don't want to waste a second
trying to find a way to kill this thing.

232
00:22:54,708 --> 00:22:56,794
I don't know if we should kill it.

233
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:01,799
This area of the ice sheet
is formed over a meteor crater.

234
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:05,803
The worm lives in ammonia.
It survived subzero temperatures.

235
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:11,725
Theorists believe in ammonia-supported life
on planets with freezing temperatures.

236
00:23:11,809 --> 00:23:12,851
No.

237
00:23:12,935 --> 00:23:15,813
A meteor that crashed here
¼ million years ago...

238
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:18,148
...may have carried such life to Earth.

239
00:23:18,232 --> 00:23:22,736
Mulder, that pilot developed
surface symptoms within a few minutes.

240
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:26,240
Within a few hours,
that parasite had total control.

241
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:30,369
What would happen
if this got into the population?

242
00:23:30,452 --> 00:23:35,916
A city the size of New York
could be infected within a few days.

243
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,210
Exactly. But what do we know about it?

244
00:23:38,294 --> 00:23:41,589
This organism might be
lying dormant in another crater.

245
00:23:41,672 --> 00:23:44,091
If we don't kill it now,

246
00:23:44,174 --> 00:23:47,595
we risk becoming Richter and Campbell
with guns to our heads.

247
00:23:47,678 --> 00:23:52,016
But if we do kill it now, we may never
know how to stop it in the future.

248
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:55,060
<i>Future? Mulder, how can you talk...</i>

249
00:24:03,694 --> 00:24:05,779
Tell me it's hot in here.

250
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:10,034
Don't worry, you don't have a fever.
The heating's malfunctioning.

251
00:24:10,117 --> 00:24:13,037
Outside it's 40 below,
in here it's sweltering.

252
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,666
- Can you hear what they're arguing about?
- Probably government secrets.

253
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:20,794
You think they knew what was here
before we arrived?

254
00:24:21,587 --> 00:24:24,923
- I'm sure of it.

255
00:24:25,007 --> 00:24:28,427
You know, Bear's infected blood
did get on Scully.

256
00:24:29,637 --> 00:24:31,972
It also got on <i>you.</i>

257
00:24:34,725 --> 00:24:39,229
<i>They'd sacrifice</i>
<i>not just evidence, but themselves!</i>

258
00:24:39,313 --> 00:24:43,484
- How do you know it can't be contained?
- It can! By extermination!

259
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:47,738
We should take those bodies, worms
and all, outside and incinerate them!

260
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:50,199
Something going on
we should know about?

261
00:24:50,282 --> 00:24:52,201
Agent Scully, are you all right?

262
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:56,497
- Yes. I'm fine. It's nothing.
- You seem a little bit stressed out.

263
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:01,960
What the hell are you trying to say?!

264
00:25:02,044 --> 00:25:06,215
Let's settle down. It's been a long day.
We're all tired and scared.

265
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:10,511
- Let's not turn on one another.
- At least, not without a good reason.

266
00:25:10,594 --> 00:25:12,805
Maybe we should
all get some sleep.

267
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:16,850
Are you kidding? You think
any of us could sleep right now?

268
00:25:16,934 --> 00:25:20,437
Come on, guys, let's face it.
We gotta check for spots.

269
00:25:20,521 --> 00:25:23,649
And any person who has them
should be confined.

270
00:25:23,732 --> 00:25:25,818
Are we agreed on that?

271
00:25:25,901 --> 00:25:27,986
Are you gonna do the exams?

272
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:32,116
No! We do them in front of each other.

273
00:25:32,199 --> 00:25:34,284
No secrets.

274
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,334
Before anyone passes judgment...

275
00:25:42,418 --> 00:25:44,962
...may I remind you, we are in the Arctic.

276
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:17,077
Sleep tight.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

277
00:26:17,161 --> 00:26:19,246
Yeah. Good night.

278
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:36,054
Good night, Mulder.

279
00:26:37,181 --> 00:26:38,682
Good night, Scully.

280
00:26:38,766 --> 00:26:40,851
At least everyone's OK.

281
00:26:40,934 --> 00:26:43,187
Don't forget...

282
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:45,147
...the spots on the dog went away.

283
00:27:39,743 --> 00:27:43,497
<i>The ball's on the three-yard line...</i>

284
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:46,124
<i>.. with only 15 seconds left in the game.</i>

285
00:27:46,208 --> 00:27:49,545
<i>Fouts moves over the ball.</i>
<i>There's the snap!</i>

286
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:30,831
Mulder, what are you doing?

287
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:33,542
Murphy's dead.

288
00:30:34,876 --> 00:30:36,461
You killed him.

289
00:30:36,545 --> 00:30:38,714
I found him like this.

290
00:30:38,797 --> 00:30:40,841
I heard one of the doors close.

291
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:43,135
I came out to check it out.

292
00:30:43,218 --> 00:30:45,512
- It's one of you.
<i>- </i> He's lying.

293
00:30:45,595 --> 00:30:49,016
- You could've done it and not known.
- No, he said he didn't.

294
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:50,434
I have no symptoms.

295
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:52,602
- You checked him.
- Yeah, six hours ago!

296
00:30:52,686 --> 00:30:56,023
- It was one of you!
- Stop it! Shut up!

297
00:30:57,983 --> 00:30:59,568
Mulder...

298
00:30:59,651 --> 00:31:03,030
...just put the gun down and
let Hodge give you a blood test.

299
00:31:03,113 --> 00:31:05,699
And doctor the results? <i>He</i> may be infected!

300
00:31:05,782 --> 00:31:07,868
He has to be confined - now!

301
00:31:07,951 --> 00:31:11,038
Then turn around and let us
take a look at your neck!

302
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:15,375
I'm not turning my back on anyone!
As far as I'm concerned, you're all infected!

303
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:17,335
Hodge is right! Lock him up!

304
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,964
- Mulder!
- Scully, get that gun off me!

305
00:31:21,048 --> 00:31:23,592
- Mulder, you have to understand!
- Put it down!

306
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:25,927
- You put it down first!
- Scully!

307
00:31:27,637 --> 00:31:29,848
For God's sakes, it's me!

308
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:34,644
Mulder, you may not be who you are!

309
00:32:00,045 --> 00:32:02,339
In here, I'll be safer than you.

310
00:33:06,027 --> 00:33:08,530
What were you doing?

311
00:33:08,613 --> 00:33:10,699
You know what I was doing.

312
00:33:12,284 --> 00:33:14,911
You know, you're the only one with a gun.

313
00:33:14,995 --> 00:33:17,998
If you get infected, we don't stand a chance.

314
00:33:28,508 --> 00:33:29,968
OK.

315
00:33:40,770 --> 00:33:42,439
Was there something there?

316
00:33:42,522 --> 00:33:44,941
You're OK, Nancy.

317
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:50,530
We're all OK. Now is not the time
for the three of us to turn on each other.

318
00:33:50,614 --> 00:33:52,365
There's four of us.

319
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:56,828
- Mulder isn't one of us any more.
- If Mulder is infected, it's not his fault!

320
00:33:56,912 --> 00:34:00,248
We can't turn our backs on him now!
He needs us to help him!

321
00:34:00,332 --> 00:34:03,668
She's right.
Prolonged exposure to the parasite...

322
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:07,172
...could damage him to the point
of permanent psychosis.

323
00:34:10,508 --> 00:34:13,011
But if he is infected, he doesn't go back.

324
00:34:13,094 --> 00:34:15,305
I won't risk the possibilities.

325
00:34:26,358 --> 00:34:29,277
This is AICP calling Doolittle Airfield.

326
00:34:29,361 --> 00:34:31,238
Please come in.

327
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:40,121
This is the Arctic Ice Core Project
sending a general distress call.

328
00:34:40,205 --> 00:34:42,290
Please respond.

329
00:35:00,892 --> 00:35:05,689
Nancy, put a drop of uninfected blood
on the slide of the blood from the pilot.

330
00:35:05,772 --> 00:35:07,857
Run that by me again?

331
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:11,069
Put the uninfected blood
on the infected blood.

332
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:23,331
No, damn it! What did I just tell you?!

333
00:35:23,415 --> 00:35:26,960
You infected the infected blood!
Now I have to start again!

334
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:30,463
- I made a mistake. Don't yell at me.
- Wasted hours of work!

335
00:35:30,547 --> 00:35:35,135
OK, then just do it by yourself, damn it!
God! I'm not your assistant!

336
00:35:43,643 --> 00:35:45,103
Hodge?

337
00:35:46,855 --> 00:35:48,523
What?

338
00:35:48,606 --> 00:35:50,692
Come take a look at this.

339
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:56,156
The larvae from two different worms
killed each other.

340
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:20,221
An individual worm will not tolerate
another invading its host.

341
00:36:20,305 --> 00:36:23,141
It does to the invader what it did to humans.

342
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:25,393
It makes them kill.

343
00:36:25,477 --> 00:36:29,314
A species won't kill its own.
It needs another to procreate.

344
00:36:29,397 --> 00:36:32,817
Worms are hermaphroditic.
It can reproduce itself.

345
00:36:32,901 --> 00:36:35,445
Look at the evidence in the microscope.

346
00:36:36,571 --> 00:36:38,865
This thing does not like company.

347
00:36:38,948 --> 00:36:41,034
So what are you saying?

348
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:46,164
The way to kill it is to introduce another
worm into an already infected body?

349
00:38:00,655 --> 00:38:02,740
Sounds OK.

350
00:38:14,836 --> 00:38:16,921
It passed the worms in its stool.

351
00:38:17,005 --> 00:38:19,007
They're dead.

352
00:38:23,052 --> 00:38:25,138
I want to talk to him first...

353
00:38:25,221 --> 00:38:27,223
...try and make this voluntary.

354
00:38:27,307 --> 00:38:28,892
What?

355
00:38:28,975 --> 00:38:31,060
You can't go in alone.

356
00:38:31,144 --> 00:38:34,439
If anything happens, you come inside.

357
00:38:35,482 --> 00:38:38,610
I can't do this to him until I'm sure.

358
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,366
Is it just you?

359
00:38:45,450 --> 00:38:47,118
Yes.

360
00:38:54,292 --> 00:38:56,377
It's one of <i>them.</i>

361
00:38:56,461 --> 00:38:59,589
No one's been killed
since you've been in here.

362
00:39:00,507 --> 00:39:02,175
So?

363
00:39:04,427 --> 00:39:06,513
We found a way to kill it.

364
00:39:07,889 --> 00:39:10,642
Two worms... in one host...

365
00:39:10,725 --> 00:39:12,810
...will kill each other.

366
00:39:17,607 --> 00:39:20,693
You give me <i>one</i> worm, you'll infect me.

367
00:39:20,777 --> 00:39:22,862
If that's true...

368
00:39:22,946 --> 00:39:25,740
...then why didn't you let us inspect you?

369
00:39:25,823 --> 00:39:29,118
I would have, but you pulled a gun on me!

370
00:39:29,202 --> 00:39:31,287
Now, I don't trust them!

371
00:39:33,248 --> 00:39:35,333
I <i>want</i> to trust <i>you.</i>

372
00:39:39,003 --> 00:39:40,880
OK.

373
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,677
But now they're not here.

374
00:40:33,433 --> 00:40:35,518
This is the last one.

375
00:40:38,229 --> 00:40:40,565
She's not gonna let us give it to him.

376
00:40:40,648 --> 00:40:43,151
Well, she'll have to if he's infected.

377
00:40:43,234 --> 00:40:45,194
He'll convince her somehow.

378
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:55,330
I just examined him.

379
00:40:55,413 --> 00:40:57,123
He's uninfected.

380
00:40:59,167 --> 00:41:01,252
So is she.

381
00:41:01,336 --> 00:41:04,005
Which means that it must be one of you.

382
00:41:05,715 --> 00:41:09,218
All right. Let's go over to the main building.

383
00:41:09,302 --> 00:41:11,471
I'd like to check him myself.

384
00:41:11,554 --> 00:41:13,931
Then he can examine both of us.

385
00:41:14,974 --> 00:41:16,809
Want to lead the way?

386
00:41:24,651 --> 00:41:25,985
No!

387
00:41:47,882 --> 00:41:49,425
Get the worm!

388
00:41:59,268 --> 00:42:00,770
No! No!

389
00:42:03,773 --> 00:42:05,316
Oh, my God.

390
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:31,441
I can't... do anything.

391
00:36:31,566 --> 00:36:33,777
There's something wrong.

392
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,571
You know, up here?

393
00:36:36,654 --> 00:36:41,076
And I can't help anyone.

394
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:47,749
I deliver the flowers. That's all I do.

395
00:42:48,067 --> 00:42:49,402
Hodge! Now!

396
00:42:50,528 --> 00:42:55,241
Mulder! After this, there won't be any left!
They're all gonna be dead!

397
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:56,993
Do it!

398
00:43:05,209 --> 00:43:07,295
Shh... Shh...

399
00:43:18,556 --> 00:43:21,058
It's all right. It's all over.

400
00:43:22,727 --> 00:43:25,271
It all stops right here...

401
00:43:25,354 --> 00:43:27,440
...right now.

402
00:43:28,566 --> 00:43:30,651
OK, I got it.

403
00:43:30,735 --> 00:43:33,488
At the intersection
of Yukon and 17th.

404
00:43:33,571 --> 00:43:36,032
State patrol is on the scene. Code 3. Over.

405
00:43:44,040 --> 00:43:47,084
She'll be put in quarantine
along with the dog.

406
00:43:47,168 --> 00:43:51,714
We'll keep her there until we're sure
she won't infect the population.

407
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:55,968
Meanwhile, our tests came back normal,
so we've been released.

408
00:43:56,052 --> 00:44:00,014
Plane ready. It'll take you
as far from the ice as you wanna go.

409
00:44:00,723 --> 00:44:06,103
I'm goin' back to the site. This time I'm
going fully prepared with proper equipment.

410
00:44:06,187 --> 00:44:09,941
There's still research to be done
on the genetic structure...

411
00:44:10,024 --> 00:44:12,944
Wait, Mulder. Don't you know?

412
00:44:13,027 --> 00:44:14,278
Know what?

413
00:44:14,362 --> 00:44:18,407
45 minutes after evacuating us,
they torched the place.

414
00:44:18,491 --> 00:44:20,243
There's nothing left.

415
00:44:20,326 --> 00:44:22,036
Who did that?

416
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:25,540
The military? Centers for Disease Control?

417
00:44:25,623 --> 00:44:28,751
You ought to know. They're your people.

418
00:44:34,674 --> 00:44:36,759
It's still there, Scully.

419
00:44:38,344 --> 00:44:40,429
200,000 years down...

420
00:44:40,513 --> 00:44:42,598
...in the ice.

421
00:44:45,101 --> 00:44:47,186
Leave it there.

422
00:45:33,149 --> 00:45:34,650
