1
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:25,379
Kids...

2
00:01:25,504 --> 00:01:27,464
Mom! Mom!

3
00:01:27,547 --> 00:01:29,258
Kevin!

4
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:38,183
Mom! Mom! Mom!

5
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,394
Mom! Mom!

6
00:01:41,395 --> 00:01:44,439
Mom! Ruby's gone!

7
00:01:46,858 --> 00:01:48,944
Ruby?

8
00:01:49,278 --> 00:01:51,363
Ruby!

9
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,116
Ruby!

10
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,536
Ruby!

11
00:02:00,706 --> 00:02:02,749
Ruby!

12
00:02:58,972 --> 00:03:01,350
Agent Mulder's latest 302.

13
00:03:01,433 --> 00:03:05,604
Requesting assignment
and travel expenses for the both of you.

14
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:11,735
Sioux City, Iowa.
That's the first I've heard of it.

15
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:17,199
It came up through channels, from Mulder's
ASAC to the District G-14, then my desk.

16
00:03:17,282 --> 00:03:19,951
I don't understand.

17
00:03:22,162 --> 00:03:24,831
In essence, Mulder wants the Bureau...

18
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:28,543
...to assign a case number
to a tabloid headline.

19
00:03:28,627 --> 00:03:32,631
- He must have more evidence than...
- Not according to his 302.

20
00:03:32,714 --> 00:03:34,800
I admit, that is strange.

21
00:03:36,134 --> 00:03:37,636
Even for Mulder.

22
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:50,649
Perhaps it has something to do with this.

23
00:03:50,732 --> 00:03:52,317
Take a look.

24
00:03:52,401 --> 00:03:53,568
An X-File?

25
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,839
Has he shared this with you?

26
00:04:15,841 --> 00:04:20,178
There's no need to protect him.
He initiated the file himself.

27
00:04:22,848 --> 00:04:24,891
She was his sister.

28
00:04:25,851 --> 00:04:29,062
She disappeared 21 years ago. He was...

29
00:04:29,855 --> 00:04:31,523
...12 and she was 8.

30
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:34,776
He claims that he was in the room
when it happened.

31
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,865
He recalls a...
bright light outside the window and...

32
00:04:41,074 --> 00:04:43,201
...a presence in the room.

33
00:04:43,285 --> 00:04:46,204
In your opinion,

34
00:04:46,288 --> 00:04:50,625
has Agent Mulder's personal agenda
clouded his professional judgment?

35
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:53,170
In my opinion, no.

36
00:04:53,253 --> 00:04:55,964
But you can see
how it might appear that way?

37
00:04:56,381 --> 00:04:58,467
As you know...

38
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:02,929
...Mulder's preoccupation
with fringe matters

39
00:05:03,013 --> 00:05:05,223
has been a source of friction in the Bureau.

40
00:05:05,307 --> 00:05:07,559
This is another case in point.

41
00:05:08,643 --> 00:05:11,313
I'm going to disallow the 302.

42
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:13,356
With respect, sir,

43
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:19,154
at least let me talk with him
and make a recommendation.

44
00:05:19,237 --> 00:05:25,243
It just doesn't seem substantial enough
to warrant an investigation.

45
00:05:25,327 --> 00:05:29,456
So we disagree.
It's not the first time, it won't be the last.

46
00:05:29,581 --> 00:05:33,752
- If we had a legitimate source...
- This is the essence of science.

47
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:38,548
Ask an impertinent question,
you're on your way to a pertinent answer.

48
00:05:38,632 --> 00:05:41,801
What makes this case any more credible

49
00:05:41,885 --> 00:05:45,138
than the 100-year-old mother
with the lizard baby?

50
00:05:45,263 --> 00:05:50,101
Because the lizard baby wasn't born
anywhere near Lake Okobogee.

51
00:05:50,185 --> 00:05:51,311
Oko-what?

52
00:05:51,436 --> 00:05:52,771
Bogee.

53
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:54,940
Okobogee.

54
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:59,152
Is that supposed to mean something to me?

55
00:05:59,277 --> 00:06:02,697
If you know anything about trout fishing.

56
00:06:02,781 --> 00:06:04,866
Or UFO hot spots.

57
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:07,953
Define hot spot.

58
00:06:08,036 --> 00:06:14,000
Four sightings in 1967, August, including
one by a National Weather Service plane.

59
00:06:15,627 --> 00:06:19,548
This is a light-blasted
digitally-enhanced enlargement.

60
00:06:19,631 --> 00:06:21,466
The pilot took that?

61
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:23,885
Try a Girl Scout with an Instamatic.

62
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:28,932
Four girls said they saw something.
Five, including the Den Mother.

63
00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:32,352
The Air Force said it was a weather balloon.

64
00:06:32,477 --> 00:06:36,731
But no weather balloon was launched
that day within 700 miles.

65
00:06:39,734 --> 00:06:43,071
Now read me the names
of those Girl Scouts from 1967.

66
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:49,578
Lisa Terrel, Bonnie Winston,
Doreen McCallister, Darlene Mor...

67
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,043
It's the same Darlene Morris.

68
00:07:31,786 --> 00:07:35,707
Darlene Morris? I'm Agent Scully
and this is Agent Fox Mulder.

69
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:38,418
We talked with you on the phone last night.

70
00:07:38,543 --> 00:07:40,587
Please come in.

71
00:07:44,758 --> 00:07:49,888
Well, I knew that if I screamed loud and long
enough that someone would listen.

72
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:52,057
But I never expected the FBI.

73
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:56,269
This is Kevin. Kevin...

74
00:07:56,394 --> 00:07:57,937
...say hi.

75
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:03,735
Would you like some coffee?

76
00:08:42,857 --> 00:08:44,943
Some days I can't even...

77
00:08:45,026 --> 00:08:47,112
...get myself up out of bed.

78
00:08:49,114 --> 00:08:52,534
And Kevin has been acting so strange.

79
00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:58,331
I don't know what to do any more.
I just want her back again.

80
00:08:58,456 --> 00:09:00,375
Ms Morris...

81
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:04,504
...during the divorce,
was there a custody battle?

82
00:09:04,629 --> 00:09:07,298
Charles had nothing to do with this.

83
00:09:07,382 --> 00:09:09,175
How can you be so sure?

84
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:12,387
Because I know what happened.

85
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:15,473
It's just like it was before.

86
00:09:15,557 --> 00:09:20,019
- Summer of 1967? The Girl Scout troop?
- How did you know about that?

87
00:09:20,145 --> 00:09:24,899
Your name's on record at the Center
for UFO Studies in Evanston, Illinois.

88
00:09:25,817 --> 00:09:27,736
Really?

89
00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:32,490
A pilot made a similar sighting
over the same area on the same day.

90
00:09:32,574 --> 00:09:34,826
They took her, didn't they?

91
00:09:40,415 --> 00:09:45,295
You... you said that, um,
Kevin was there the night it happened?

92
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:48,548
He didn't see anything. He was asleep.

93
00:09:48,673 --> 00:09:50,592
Can I talk to him anyway?

94
00:09:52,177 --> 00:09:54,220
Thanks.

95
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:04,314
You know...

96
00:10:04,397 --> 00:10:07,192
...I've told this story so many times now.

97
00:10:07,275 --> 00:10:10,528
Oh, to the newspapers and the police.

98
00:10:12,197 --> 00:10:18,203
And every time I tell it,
people get this... look in their eye.

99
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:22,540
Just like the look that you've got right now.

100
00:10:27,128 --> 00:10:29,380
Hey, buddy.

101
00:10:29,464 --> 00:10:31,549
Mind if I sit down?

102
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,135
Thanks.

103
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:38,890
Your mom tells me
you've been having nightmares.

104
00:10:39,432 --> 00:10:41,434
I guess so.

105
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:44,062
- You wanna tell me about 'em?
- No.

106
00:10:44,145 --> 00:10:46,231
All right.

107
00:10:51,236 --> 00:10:53,321
What are you doing?

108
00:10:55,657 --> 00:10:58,660
Are you making something?

109
00:10:58,743 --> 00:11:00,787
Can I take a look at it?

110
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,460
Thanks.

111
00:11:12,423 --> 00:11:14,467
It's coming from there.

112
00:11:16,594 --> 00:11:18,680
The TV?

113
00:11:29,315 --> 00:11:36,197
Maybe it's a binary sequence.
Could be anything, could be nothing.

114
00:11:36,281 --> 00:11:37,949
I know you're busy.

115
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:40,368
Look, I know a friend who knows a friend

116
00:11:40,451 --> 00:11:43,371
who can get you a ticket
to a Redskins game.

117
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:45,039
You got it!

118
00:11:45,123 --> 00:11:47,417
All right. You know where to find me?

119
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,627
Thanks, Danny.

120
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:54,382
So, as I was telling your partner,
we found no evidence of kidnap.

121
00:11:54,465 --> 00:11:56,509
No phone call, no ransom note.

122
00:11:56,634 --> 00:12:00,805
- And since we have no body...
- You assumed she ran away?

123
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:04,642
It wouldn't be the first time
Ruby ran away from home.

124
00:12:04,726 --> 00:12:08,229
How do you explain what her mother saw?

125
00:12:08,313 --> 00:12:12,066
I think Darlene
has a very active imagination.

126
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:14,485
I've heard those stories since first grade.

127
00:12:14,569 --> 00:12:18,197
So, basically, you ignored her statement.

128
00:12:19,741 --> 00:12:22,452
I included it in my report.

129
00:12:22,535 --> 00:12:25,079
But you didn't bother to check it out.

130
00:12:25,163 --> 00:12:27,415
We found nothing at the campsite.

131
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:31,878
Let me tell you something.
Darlene's little girl was no prom queen.

132
00:12:32,003 --> 00:12:36,257
I can't count the number of times
I pulled her out of parked cars...

133
00:12:36,341 --> 00:12:38,676
...or found her puking her guts out.

134
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:41,930
- It was just a matter of time...
- Before what?

135
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:49,938
Before something bad happened. If Darlene
makes up stories to get past that, fine.

136
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:54,567
But don't tell me it's the truth.
I'm not gonna waste my time.

137
00:12:55,068 --> 00:13:00,031
I just think it's a good idea
not to antagonise local law enforcement.

138
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:02,450
Who, me? I'm Mr Congeniality.

139
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:05,244
We might need his help one of these days.

140
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,413
I'll send him a Bundt cake.

141
00:13:45,451 --> 00:13:48,162
You're looking for Ruby, right?

142
00:13:48,246 --> 00:13:49,622
That's right.

143
00:13:49,747 --> 00:13:51,457
Who are you?

144
00:13:51,582 --> 00:13:52,959
Doesn't matter.

145
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:55,712
Are you a friend of Ruby's?

146
00:13:55,795 --> 00:14:01,009
Ruby didn't have friends.
She just had people she liked to hang with.

147
00:14:01,092 --> 00:14:03,845
And she liked to hang out with you?

148
00:14:04,679 --> 00:14:06,764
I guess we had some times.

149
00:14:06,848 --> 00:14:09,934
- Like the night she disappeared?
- It was Greg.

150
00:14:10,018 --> 00:14:12,687
She was supposed to see him that night.

151
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:16,441
- Who's Greg?
- Her boyfriend, Greg Randall.

152
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:21,571
Supposed to meet up at the lake.
They had stuff to talk about.

153
00:14:21,654 --> 00:14:23,114
What kind of stuff?

154
00:14:23,614 --> 00:14:25,491
Greg got Ruby pregnant.

155
00:14:26,784 --> 00:14:29,412
Whatever. She got herself pregnant.

156
00:14:29,495 --> 00:14:32,957
Do you know
what they were planning to do about it?

157
00:14:34,292 --> 00:14:38,629
They were gonna leave town.
At least that's what Ruby told me.

158
00:14:39,964 --> 00:14:41,799
You know Greg from school?

159
00:14:43,051 --> 00:14:45,136
Greg? School?

160
00:14:45,219 --> 00:14:47,555
I don't think so.

161
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:52,477
All he ever did since we met him
was pour beer. The Pennsylvania Pub.

162
00:15:35,186 --> 00:15:38,564
Excuse me! Do you know
where we can find Greg Randall?

163
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:40,733
Who's asking?

164
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:48,032
What kind of trouble's he in now?

165
00:15:48,116 --> 00:15:50,743
We were hoping you could tell us.

166
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:55,123
Greg called in sick three weeks ago.
I haven't heard from him since.

167
00:15:55,206 --> 00:15:58,042
Any ideas where he might have gone?

168
00:15:58,126 --> 00:16:01,504
No, but if you find him, tell him he's fired.

169
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:04,966
This is our hotel if you hear of anything.

170
00:16:13,599 --> 00:16:16,102
That's a nice tattoo. What is that?

171
00:16:16,227 --> 00:16:18,020
What's it look like?

172
00:16:18,104 --> 00:16:22,525
A flying saucer.
You don't believe that stuff, do you?

173
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:24,360
I take it you don't?

174
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:29,157
No, I think it's just a bunch of crazy people
howling at the moon.

175
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,910
So, you haven't been out
to Lake Okobogee, have you?

176
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:35,454
No, I haven't. Why?

177
00:16:35,580 --> 00:16:38,291
You should ride with us some time.

178
00:16:38,416 --> 00:16:42,295
You might see some things
that'd change your mind.

179
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:48,759
Get a killer sunburn
in the middle of the night.

180
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:46,984
Where's Mulder?

181
00:17:50,988 --> 00:17:53,074
Where did you get the document?

182
00:17:53,157 --> 00:17:56,994
If you explain what you're talking about,
maybe I can help.

183
00:18:05,211 --> 00:18:07,296
This is a document?

184
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:10,341
It just looks like
a bunch of ones and zeros to me.

185
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:14,303
- Tell me where you got it.
- Tell me what it is.

186
00:18:14,387 --> 00:18:17,473
Keep playing games
and you'll be facing the D6.

187
00:18:17,556 --> 00:18:21,143
You can explain to them
why you're obstructing justice.

188
00:18:21,227 --> 00:18:23,479
It's your call, Holtzman.

189
00:18:23,562 --> 00:18:27,650
But I'm not accountable to anybody
outside my sub-committee.

190
00:18:27,733 --> 00:18:31,445
I don't care if it's the NSA
or the Vatican police.

191
00:18:33,364 --> 00:18:36,033
It's a defence satellite transmission.

192
00:18:36,117 --> 00:18:38,160
You're kidding!

193
00:18:38,244 --> 00:18:42,707
A fragment, but highly classified.
We need to know where it came from.

194
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:46,377
Well, sure.
I'll let you know as soon as I find out.

195
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,381
You just bought yourself
a one-way back to Washington.

196
00:18:53,050 --> 00:18:55,136
We got it.

197
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:01,434
Great.

198
00:19:05,146 --> 00:19:06,188
What?

199
00:19:06,272 --> 00:19:09,692
You shouldn't have told 'em.
They have no jurisdiction.

200
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:14,739
Mulder, they're NSA. They think
the boy's a threat to national security.

201
00:19:14,822 --> 00:19:20,745
How can an 8-year-old boy who can barely
multiply be a threat to national security?

202
00:19:20,828 --> 00:19:22,538
People call me paranoid.

203
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:26,500
How did Kevin obtain
top-secret information?

204
00:19:26,584 --> 00:19:28,753
Where do you think he got it from?

205
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,955
Watch your step, ma'am.

206
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:12,505
It'll be OK, baby. Don't worry.

207
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,965
- It'll be OK.
- Come with me, son.

208
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:16,550
Mom!

209
00:20:18,511 --> 00:20:20,137
It'll be all right, baby.

210
00:20:22,306 --> 00:20:24,392
Watch your head, please.

211
00:20:51,544 --> 00:20:54,004
You guys do really delicate work.

212
00:20:54,088 --> 00:20:56,590
Let's get this to Cryptography.

213
00:20:57,758 --> 00:21:00,344
I think we got what we needed. Thank you.

214
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:18,946
- What is it?
- I'm not sure.

215
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:54,523
- We scanned it through the mainframe.
- And none of the information is actionable?

216
00:21:54,607 --> 00:21:59,445
Other than the satellite transmission,
none of it is a national security risk.

217
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,906
The boy's being released later.

218
00:22:01,989 --> 00:22:04,867
So it was just a random set
of ones and zeros?

219
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:07,203
There was nothing random about it.

220
00:22:07,286 --> 00:22:08,662
I don't understand.

221
00:22:08,746 --> 00:22:13,417
All information can be rendered digitally
in a series of ones and zeros.

222
00:22:13,501 --> 00:22:19,089
When we downloaded the data, we found
an amazing range of... Well, see for yourself.

223
00:22:19,173 --> 00:22:21,133
Da Vinci's Universal Man.

224
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:27,097
A DNA double helix.

225
00:22:28,807 --> 00:22:30,935
There's lots more.

226
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:37,191
That's the Brandenburg Concertos.

227
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:42,655
But they're just fragments. Some lines
from the Koran, a Shakespearean sonnet.

228
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,324
Like someone's switching channels?

229
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:01,757
- Mrs Morris?
- I have nothing to say to you.

230
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,301
Please, give me a minute to explain.

231
00:23:08,472 --> 00:23:11,850
Would you please just wait
right over there for mama?

232
00:23:14,812 --> 00:23:20,109
- I thought you were supposed to help us.
- This has been a terrible mistake.

233
00:23:20,192 --> 00:23:24,113
The government will pay
for all repairs and damages.

234
00:23:24,196 --> 00:23:26,865
I don't want your money.
I want my daughter back.

235
00:23:26,991 --> 00:23:29,118
And I want you to leave us alone.

236
00:23:29,201 --> 00:23:31,954
But your son has seen something.

237
00:23:32,037 --> 00:23:35,374
You stay away from me
and you stay away from my child.

238
00:23:43,674 --> 00:23:45,301
Come on, honey.

239
00:23:45,384 --> 00:23:47,219
It's OK. Let's go now.

240
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:08,907
I thought we were headed back into town.

241
00:24:10,117 --> 00:24:11,744
Where are we going?

242
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:15,372
The boy is the key, Scully. I know it.

243
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:18,834
- The key to what?
- Finding Ruby.

244
00:24:18,917 --> 00:24:21,754
Just think about it for a minute.

245
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:25,633
He's receiving digitised data
from a television screen.

246
00:24:25,716 --> 00:24:28,927
Agent Atsumi
said it was a statistical aberration.

247
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:37,853
- I admit it's not much of an explanation...
- I think that Kevin is a conduit of some kind.

248
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:39,355
A conduit?

249
00:24:39,438 --> 00:24:43,359
A link... or a connection to whoever...

250
00:24:43,442 --> 00:24:46,445
...or whatever took Ruby that night.

251
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,780
But how?

252
00:24:47,905 --> 00:24:52,785
If there was an abduction, it's likely
that Kevin was touched in some way.

253
00:24:55,496 --> 00:24:57,956
Mulder, I know what you're thinking.

254
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:04,755
I know why this is so important to you.

255
00:25:06,924 --> 00:25:08,592
I know!

256
00:25:09,802 --> 00:25:14,098
But there is no evidence
indicating an abduction.

257
00:25:14,932 --> 00:25:18,143
That's why we're going to Lake Okobogee.

258
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:28,779
According to the police photos,
Ruby and Kevin were sleeping right here.

259
00:25:28,862 --> 00:25:31,365
A stone's throw from the forest wall.

260
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:33,450
Meaning what?

261
00:25:33,534 --> 00:25:37,496
Meaning anybody could have
come out of the forest to grab her.

262
00:25:41,125 --> 00:25:43,377
Have you noticed the tree line?

263
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:47,005
Evidence of extreme heat.

264
00:25:47,715 --> 00:25:49,800
Or an electrical storm.

265
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:54,221
Besides which, there's nothing
to connect it to the night...

266
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:57,182
- ..of Ruby's disappearance.
- That's true.

267
00:26:03,063 --> 00:26:06,191
Do you think lightning
could have caused this?

268
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:10,696
Do you have any idea at what
temperature sand solidifies into glass?

269
00:26:10,821 --> 00:26:13,741
2,500º Fahrenheit.

270
00:26:13,824 --> 00:26:18,579
Something was out here. Something
hot enough to turn sand into glass.

271
00:26:18,662 --> 00:26:22,666
To singe those trees
and to blister the roof of that camper.

272
00:26:33,343 --> 00:26:35,053
Mulder!

273
00:26:35,179 --> 00:26:37,222
Look!

274
00:27:19,056 --> 00:27:20,474
What is it?

275
00:27:20,557 --> 00:27:24,561
It's a grave. Shallow, by the smell of it.

276
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:32,402
What are you doing?

277
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:37,407
Mulder, you are disturbing a crime scene.

278
00:27:41,078 --> 00:27:43,163
Stop!

279
00:27:44,248 --> 00:27:46,291
What if it's her?

280
00:27:47,167 --> 00:27:49,253
I need to know.

281
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:10,941
Are you OK, Mulder?

282
00:28:11,024 --> 00:28:12,359
Fine.

283
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:17,489
Looks like a male Caucasian.

284
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:26,540
Sir.

285
00:28:31,378 --> 00:28:33,463
Victim's name was Greg Randall.

286
00:28:35,132 --> 00:28:37,217
Ruby's boyfriend.

287
00:28:37,301 --> 00:28:39,678
Ruby had a lot of boyfriends.

288
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:43,515
- Can I take a look at that?
- Go right ahead.

289
00:29:19,927 --> 00:29:21,386
Look at that.

290
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:24,348
It's her. The girl from the library.

291
00:29:24,431 --> 00:29:25,515
Who?

292
00:29:25,599 --> 00:29:30,062
We didn't get her name, but she claimed
Greg and Ruby had run off together.

293
00:29:30,187 --> 00:29:33,941
Well, Doc Fowler's a buddy of mine.
Delivered both my kids.

294
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:36,652
I can find out who had that appointment.

295
00:29:54,753 --> 00:29:56,880
Have a seat, Tessa.

296
00:30:07,724 --> 00:30:10,227
We know that you lied to us the other day.

297
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:14,773
We know that you had the appointment
with Dr Fowler on August 7th.

298
00:30:14,898 --> 00:30:18,235
We know that you're pregnant, not Ruby.

299
00:30:18,318 --> 00:30:22,447
- Then you don't know nothing.
- We can prove it, Tessa.

300
00:30:22,572 --> 00:30:25,617
And we can prove that Greg...
was the father.

301
00:30:25,742 --> 00:30:27,786
So what if he was the father?

302
00:30:27,911 --> 00:30:30,372
This is very serious.

303
00:30:30,455 --> 00:30:33,417
Do you understand how serious this is?

304
00:30:34,251 --> 00:30:37,504
You've waived
the right to an attorney.

305
00:30:37,587 --> 00:30:40,465
So if you lie to us here today...

306
00:30:42,342 --> 00:30:44,803
...you could be charged with perjury.

307
00:30:50,517 --> 00:30:53,103
He promised me
we'd be in LA by Christmas.

308
00:30:54,312 --> 00:30:56,398
He had a friend there.

309
00:30:56,481 --> 00:30:58,734
And I'd never seen the ocean.

310
00:30:58,817 --> 00:31:01,653
You said he and Ruby
were seeing each other.

311
00:31:01,778 --> 00:31:06,116
You said they were planning
to meet at the lake. Is that true?

312
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:10,120
Lookit, I was nowhere
near the lake that night, OK?

313
00:31:10,203 --> 00:31:12,122
Sure you were, Tessa.

314
00:31:14,458 --> 00:31:18,587
You knew they were meeting,
so you sat and you waited for them.

315
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:21,548
- You were angry and jealous.
- I wasn't.

316
00:31:21,631 --> 00:31:26,094
You waited, and when they showed
you killed him first, isn't that how it went?

317
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:29,056
- No.
- You snuck up and you shot him in the back.

318
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:31,224
Bam!

319
00:31:32,976 --> 00:31:35,395
And then you killed Ruby.

320
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:36,479
Bam!

321
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:41,902
What was she doin' before she died?

322
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:45,781
Was she pleading for her life?
Was she running away?

323
00:31:45,864 --> 00:31:47,324
I didn't kill her!

324
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:49,284
- Where's she buried?
- I don't know!

325
00:31:49,367 --> 00:31:52,871
- You don't know where you buried her?
- I didn't kill her!

326
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:56,583
- You didn't?
- She wasn't even there that night!

327
00:31:59,669 --> 00:32:05,008
Well, how would you know that, Tessa,
if you weren't there yourself?

328
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:13,308
You're not seeing the whole picture here.

329
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:17,687
- Which is?
- Which is that in all likelihood Ruby is dead.

330
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:21,942
Is that your conclusion
or the Sioux City Sheriff's Department's?

331
00:32:22,025 --> 00:32:26,738
They're searching the National Park
and a dive team is going to drag the lake.

332
00:32:26,863 --> 00:32:28,657
They're wasting their time.

333
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,368
Do you really think
Tessa is telling the truth?

334
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:34,913
Why not?
What if Ruby never did show up that night?

335
00:32:35,038 --> 00:32:38,625
She lied to us in the library
and lied about her pregnancy.

336
00:32:38,708 --> 00:32:41,294
Why wouldn't she lie about killing Ruby?

337
00:32:41,378 --> 00:32:44,923
Because something was out there
in those woods!

338
00:32:46,424 --> 00:32:50,804
We have a suspect in custody.
We have a confession to one murder...

339
00:32:50,887 --> 00:32:54,975
...and a statement which speaks
to the intent to commit another.

340
00:32:55,058 --> 00:32:59,688
It's over, Mulder. It's time
to turn this over to local law enforcement.

341
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:01,273
I can't do that.

342
00:33:02,732 --> 00:33:04,985
Mulder, where are you going?

343
00:33:05,068 --> 00:33:06,695
To talk to the boy.

344
00:33:06,778 --> 00:33:09,698
- Darlene won't let you.
- I've gotta see him.

345
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:12,325
They don't want anything to do with us!

346
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:15,579
Mulder, stop! Stop running after your sister.

347
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:22,335
This won't bring her back.

348
00:33:23,628 --> 00:33:28,925
Come with me or don't, but until they
find a body I'm not giving up on that girl.

349
00:33:42,647 --> 00:33:44,774
Hello?

350
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,695
Mrs Morris?

351
00:33:49,988 --> 00:33:52,115
Kevin?

352
00:34:26,483 --> 00:34:28,526
Mulder?

353
00:34:33,073 --> 00:34:35,158
What does it mean?

354
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:37,827
I don't know.

355
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:42,666
I'm gonna check upstairs.

356
00:34:53,343 --> 00:34:54,886
Oh, my God!

357
00:34:55,428 --> 00:34:57,055
What is it?

358
00:34:58,056 --> 00:34:59,224
Just come up here.

359
00:35:06,523 --> 00:35:08,024
Look.

360
00:35:10,402 --> 00:35:11,403
It's her!

361
00:35:13,029 --> 00:35:14,447
It's Ruby.

362
00:35:30,755 --> 00:35:33,466
This is a long shot. They could be anywhere.

363
00:35:35,468 --> 00:35:37,387
You know, when I was a kid...

364
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:40,056
...I had this ritual.

365
00:35:42,642 --> 00:35:45,562
I'd close my eyes
before I walked into my room.

366
00:35:45,645 --> 00:35:50,233
Because I thought that one day when
I opened them my sister would be there.

367
00:35:50,984 --> 00:35:54,988
Just lying in bed...
like nothing ever happened.

368
00:35:58,408 --> 00:36:00,577
I'm still walking into that room.

369
00:36:01,828 --> 00:36:03,913
Every day of my life.

370
00:36:09,919 --> 00:36:10,962
Scully!

371
00:36:22,932 --> 00:36:25,018
Darlene!

372
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:31,107
Look, there's a trailhead.

373
00:36:49,834 --> 00:36:52,629
- Are you OK?
- It's here. I saw it.

374
00:36:52,712 --> 00:36:55,131
- Where's Kevin?
- I couldn't keep up.

375
00:36:55,215 --> 00:36:57,300
Go ahead!

376
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:10,855
Kevin!

377
00:37:59,195 --> 00:38:02,240
- Are you OK?
- She's back!

378
00:38:02,365 --> 00:38:04,409
Kevin, I'm sorry, but...

379
00:38:05,034 --> 00:38:07,120
She's here. I know it!

380
00:38:07,787 --> 00:38:10,081
Kevin, I don't think she is.

381
00:38:10,206 --> 00:38:14,544
- I know you wanted it to be her. I did too.
- Mulder!

382
00:38:14,627 --> 00:38:16,713
Come on!

383
00:38:18,214 --> 00:38:20,300
Scully?

384
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:25,930
Ruby!

385
00:38:26,055 --> 00:38:28,099
She's unconscious but alive.

386
00:38:28,224 --> 00:38:30,727
I'll get help.

387
00:38:37,984 --> 00:38:40,820
She's been awake for almost an hour.

388
00:38:40,904 --> 00:38:42,989
Any ideas what caused the coma?

389
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:48,119
No sign of head trauma, no narcotic traces
or electrolyte abnormalities.

390
00:38:48,244 --> 00:38:50,997
But her white blood cell count was sky-high.

391
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:56,461
Any attendant reduction in the lymphocyte
population or release of glucocorticoids?

392
00:38:57,295 --> 00:38:59,422
Um...

393
00:38:59,756 --> 00:39:02,133
Actually, both. How did you know that?

394
00:39:02,258 --> 00:39:05,720
They're symptoms
of prolonged weightlessness.

395
00:39:05,803 --> 00:39:09,140
Shuttle astronauts have reported
similar imbalances.

396
00:39:27,283 --> 00:39:29,327
Hi.

397
00:39:32,455 --> 00:39:34,791
Hi, Ruby.

398
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:37,961
Who are you?

399
00:39:38,044 --> 00:39:43,633
We're with the FBI. I'm Special Agent
Dana Scully and this is Fox Mulder.

400
00:39:46,553 --> 00:39:48,680
My mom said you might be coming by.

401
00:39:48,805 --> 00:39:50,848
How are you feeling?

402
00:39:52,350 --> 00:39:54,435
Fine, I guess.

403
00:39:54,519 --> 00:39:56,604
Where were you, Ruby?

404
00:39:56,688 --> 00:39:58,398
Can you tell us?

405
00:40:01,734 --> 00:40:04,070
It's OK, Ruby. He knows.

406
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:08,741
I'm not supposed to tell.

407
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:11,703
They told me not to say.

408
00:40:11,828 --> 00:40:13,079
Who told you?

409
00:40:16,541 --> 00:40:18,376
Ruby, who told you?

410
00:40:19,836 --> 00:40:23,673
Sweetheart, you don't have to say anything.

411
00:40:24,841 --> 00:40:29,304
You're right. We should wait
till Ruby gets a little stronger.

412
00:40:29,387 --> 00:40:32,056
Can we speak outside for a moment?

413
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:46,946
I think that it's best
that we put all of this behind us.

414
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:50,158
I mean,
hasn't Ruby been through enough already?

415
00:40:50,241 --> 00:40:55,204
I know how disoriented she must seem
right now. But in a couple of weeks, we...

416
00:40:55,288 --> 00:40:58,124
I don't want her talking to you. Or anyone.

417
00:40:58,207 --> 00:41:03,630
She should be encouraged to tell her story.
It's important that you let her.

418
00:41:03,713 --> 00:41:05,548
Important to who?

419
00:41:06,924 --> 00:41:09,719
I have my daughter back.
I don't want more trouble.

420
00:41:09,802 --> 00:41:12,055
Besides, she can't remember anything.

421
00:41:12,138 --> 00:41:15,892
But she will remember one day,
even if it's only in dreams.

422
00:41:15,975 --> 00:41:20,396
When she does, she'll want to talk about it.
She'll need to talk about it.

423
00:41:20,897 --> 00:41:22,398
Like I did?

424
00:41:23,733 --> 00:41:25,568
Listen to me.

425
00:41:25,652 --> 00:41:29,072
I have been ridiculed for speaking my mind.

426
00:41:29,155 --> 00:41:31,324
But it was the truth, Darlene.

427
00:41:31,407 --> 00:41:36,245
It's caused me nothing but heartache.
I don't want the same thing for her.

428
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:39,082
It doesn't have to be that way for Ruby.

429
00:41:40,667 --> 00:41:45,588
As far as I know, she spent the last month
on the back of a Harley-Davidson.

430
00:41:45,922 --> 00:41:48,299
Is that what you'll tell Kevin?

431
00:41:50,176 --> 00:41:51,844
I'm sorry.

432
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:28,715
- Your eyes are open?
- Yeah, but it's like...

433
00:42:28,798 --> 00:42:32,176
- ..nothing's happening.
- Try turning your head.

434
00:42:32,301 --> 00:42:34,345
I can't.

435
00:42:34,637 --> 00:42:36,723
- Why not?
- I don't know.

436
00:42:38,474 --> 00:42:40,560
I can't move.

437
00:42:41,144 --> 00:42:43,229
So I don't.

438
00:42:45,815 --> 00:42:48,901
- I just lie there in bed.
- Can you see your sister?

439
00:42:49,485 --> 00:42:51,195
No.

440
00:42:51,988 --> 00:42:53,740
But I can hear her.

441
00:42:53,823 --> 00:42:59,078
- What does she say?
- She's calling out my name...

442
00:42:59,162 --> 00:43:01,247
...over and over again.

443
00:43:01,998 --> 00:43:04,083
She's crying out for help.

444
00:43:04,751 --> 00:43:07,128
But I can't help her.

445
00:43:07,211 --> 00:43:09,338
I can't move.

446
00:43:09,881 --> 00:43:13,509
- Are you scared?
- I know I should be, but I'm not.

447
00:43:15,052 --> 00:43:19,432
- Do you know why?
- Because of the voice.

448
00:43:19,515 --> 00:43:22,268
- The voice?
- The voice in my head.

449
00:43:22,351 --> 00:43:26,063
- What's it telling you?
- Not to be afraid.

450
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:30,902
It's telling me
that no harm will come to her.

451
00:43:31,027 --> 00:43:33,070
And that one day she'll return.

452
00:43:33,613 --> 00:43:35,698
Do you believe the voice?

453
00:43:38,117 --> 00:43:40,203
I want to believe.
