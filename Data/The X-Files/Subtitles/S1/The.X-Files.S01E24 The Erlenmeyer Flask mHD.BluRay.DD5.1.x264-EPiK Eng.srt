1
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,645
<i>Roger your request for assistance,</i>
<i>50. What is your location?</i>

2
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,522
<i>Unit 50, go ahead.</i>

3
00:00:20,606 --> 00:00:24,776
Suspect now westbound.
Has entered the ship works off April Street.

4
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:27,196
Unit 50 still in pursuit. Over.

5
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:29,364
<i>Unit 50, I copy. Keep me advised.</i>

6
00:00:48,675 --> 00:00:51,637
<i>This is the police!</i>
<i>Pull your vehicle over and stop!</i>

7
00:00:57,017 --> 00:01:00,520
<i>Stop your vehicle!</i>
<i>Put your hands on the hood and freeze!</i>

8
00:01:01,146 --> 00:01:02,689
Hold it!

9
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,654
On the ground! Do it!

10
00:01:09,529 --> 00:01:10,656
You hear me?

11
00:01:10,739 --> 00:01:13,492
- Face down! Do it!
- Stay there!

12
00:01:16,328 --> 00:01:17,329
Agh!

13
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:32,511
Stop! Armed officer!

14
00:01:47,901 --> 00:01:49,987
I hit him! I know I hit him!

15
00:01:50,404 --> 00:01:52,489
Where the hell did he go?

16
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:56,076
He'll be bleeding bad.

17
00:02:55,302 --> 00:02:57,888
<i>The Lipari Island group off the coast of Italy.</i>

18
00:02:57,971 --> 00:03:00,223
<i>But theirs is a very light lava, sir.</i>

19
00:03:00,307 --> 00:03:05,395
<i>Exactly. But inside there must be something</i>
<i>the weight of the heaviest rock in existence.</i>

20
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:08,523
<i>But, Professor,</i>
<i>that would be Icelandic peridotite.</i>

21
00:03:08,607 --> 00:03:10,108
<i>Precisely.</i>

22
00:03:10,192 --> 00:03:12,277
<i>- There's a piece chipped off.</i>
<i>- By me.</i>

23
00:03:12,361 --> 00:03:14,446
<i>What was the rock inside?</i>

24
00:03:14,529 --> 00:03:16,948
<i>- Icelandic peridotite.</i>

25
00:03:17,032 --> 00:03:19,534
<i>When I saw this I stopped chipping.</i>

26
00:03:19,618 --> 00:03:22,120
<i>But how could a rock from Iceland...</i>

27
00:03:22,204 --> 00:03:23,580
Mulder.

28
00:03:24,247 --> 00:03:26,333
Are you watching Channel 8?

29
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:29,336
<i>..Across the world. What's your conclusion?</i>

30
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:32,964
<i>Science does notjump to conclusions.</i>
<i>It is not a guessing game.</i>

31
00:03:33,548 --> 00:03:37,677
<i>..ship works, where a 60-mile</i>
<i>high-speed car chase ended this evening.</i>

32
00:03:37,761 --> 00:03:41,014
<i>The suspect eluded capture</i>
<i>by leaping into the harbour...</i>

33
00:03:41,098 --> 00:03:45,394
<i>..but not before reportedly</i>
<i>injuring several Ardis police officers.</i>

34
00:03:45,477 --> 00:03:48,271
<i>Captain Roy LaCerio is standing by.</i>
<i>Captain...</i>

35
00:03:48,355 --> 00:03:52,401
<i>..how did the man escape,</i>
<i>and how seriously injured were the officers?</i>

36
00:03:52,484 --> 00:03:55,737
<i>Those details are still unclear.</i>
<i>I'll be talking to...</i>

37
00:03:55,821 --> 00:03:58,573
<i>- We need you, Captain.</i>
<i>- You'll have to excuse me.</i>

38
00:03:58,657 --> 00:04:02,411
<i>Captain Roy LaCerio being pulled away</i>
<i>during an intense manhunt.</i>

39
00:04:06,748 --> 00:04:09,918
<i>Captain Roy LaCerio being pulled away</i>
<i>during an intense...</i>

40
00:04:10,836 --> 00:04:14,089
Mulder, you've been through this tape
a hundred times.

41
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:17,509
What exactly are you hoping to find?

42
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:19,678
I don't know.

43
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:23,348
And all he told you was to watch Channel 8?

44
00:04:23,432 --> 00:04:25,517
Yeah, that's all he said.

45
00:04:26,351 --> 00:04:29,521
Do we even know why
the suspect was being chased?

46
00:04:29,604 --> 00:04:33,608
As far as I can tell,
he wouldn't pull over for a moving violation.

47
00:04:33,692 --> 00:04:36,486
That oughta put him
on the Ten Most Wanted list.

48
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,655
There's gotta be something here.

49
00:04:38,738 --> 00:04:40,365
Some detail.

50
00:04:40,449 --> 00:04:42,534
Something we're not seeing.

51
00:04:42,617 --> 00:04:46,163
How do you know he's not yanking
your chain, this Deep Throat guy?

52
00:04:46,246 --> 00:04:50,000
- Why would he do that?
- He has lied to you by his own admission.

53
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:53,712
He wouldn't call if there wasn't
something here I'm supposed to see.

54
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:56,173
Something he wants me to see.

55
00:04:56,256 --> 00:04:58,550
Then what are you missing?

56
00:05:00,427 --> 00:05:04,598
There were three different law
enforcement agencies out here last night.

57
00:05:04,681 --> 00:05:06,766
Hunting a man on a moving violation?

58
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:09,728
It's not <i>Silence of the Lambs,</i>
but it's what we do.

59
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:14,149
The man in the photograph isn't wearing
a badge or uniform. He's not one of yours?

60
00:05:14,232 --> 00:05:17,319
No, sir. But like I said, it was a zoo out here.

61
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:19,488
You said the suspect was shot.

62
00:05:19,571 --> 00:05:22,449
Any explanation why the body
hasn't been recovered?

63
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:25,869
Well, we got our search ongoing.
Divers down there in shifts.

64
00:05:25,952 --> 00:05:28,038
We're certain he will be found.

65
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:30,874
It's been almost 18 hours.
Where could the body be?

66
00:05:30,957 --> 00:05:35,670
There are cables and debris all over
the bottom. This is a painstaking business.

67
00:05:35,754 --> 00:05:38,757
Can I ask what the FBI's interest
in this case would be?

68
00:05:39,966 --> 00:05:43,345
The suspect matches the description
of a federal fugitive...

69
00:05:43,428 --> 00:05:47,766
Really? How's that? No description
of the suspect's been released.

70
00:05:49,809 --> 00:05:53,021
If you don't mind,
can we take a look at the car, please?

71
00:05:53,605 --> 00:05:55,690
It's been taken to the impound.

72
00:05:55,774 --> 00:06:01,112
The report says that the car was registered
to a rental agency in Gaithersburg.

73
00:06:01,196 --> 00:06:04,282
They had no idea that
the car was even missing.

74
00:06:04,366 --> 00:06:07,869
You know, Mulder,
I think we're wasting our time here.

75
00:06:07,953 --> 00:06:10,914
I don't know what the hell
I'm supposed to find.

76
00:06:16,753 --> 00:06:20,006
You can't make out
the license plate in this photo.

77
00:06:29,182 --> 00:06:30,642
Scully, look at this!

78
00:06:32,102 --> 00:06:33,645
What?

79
00:06:35,397 --> 00:06:37,482
Look at the car in the photo.

80
00:06:38,858 --> 00:06:40,944
Look at the windshield.

81
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:47,409
It's not the same car.

82
00:06:47,492 --> 00:06:49,578
It's called a caduceus.

83
00:06:49,661 --> 00:06:52,914
It's sort of the adopted symbol
of the medical profession.

84
00:06:52,998 --> 00:06:55,834
So probably only a doctor
would have that on his car.

85
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:56,960
Mm-hm.

86
00:06:57,043 --> 00:06:59,879
I had the picture enhanced.
The plate is different.

87
00:06:59,963 --> 00:07:01,756
3-AYF.

88
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,300
Fast forward.

89
00:07:03,383 --> 00:07:06,428
That's all you can make out.
The rest is obscured.

90
00:07:09,222 --> 00:07:12,350
Danny, it's Mulder.
I need you to run a Maryland plate.

91
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:16,104
All I got is a partial.
Registered to a doctor... or used to be.

92
00:07:16,187 --> 00:07:17,772
Yeah, I'll hold.

93
00:07:17,856 --> 00:07:21,526
- They switched cars on us and lied about it.
- Why would they do that?

94
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:24,738
Maybe the real owner of the car
has got something to hide.

95
00:07:36,249 --> 00:07:39,085
- Dr Berube?
- Yes?

96
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:41,921
We're with the FBI.
Can we have a minute of your time?

97
00:07:42,005 --> 00:07:44,090
- I'm actually very busy.
- I'm sorry.

98
00:07:44,174 --> 00:07:48,803
Are you aware that a car registered to you
was involved in a high-speed chase in Ardis?

99
00:07:48,887 --> 00:07:50,096
Excuse me?

100
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:53,224
- Doctor, do you own a silver Ciera?
- Uh, yes!

101
00:07:54,017 --> 00:07:56,102
- It was used for what?
- A crime.

102
00:07:56,186 --> 00:07:59,522
- Were you aware it was missing?
- Not until you mentioned it.

103
00:07:59,606 --> 00:08:04,027
I have a housekeeper and she
often uses the car. It's a second car...

104
00:08:04,361 --> 00:08:05,362
Please!

105
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:08,823
They should not be excited.
Nothing should be touched!

106
00:08:08,907 --> 00:08:12,369
- I thought they were friendly.
- They're part of an experiment.

107
00:08:12,452 --> 00:08:14,537
What kind of experiment?

108
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:17,499
- Am I under some kind of suspicion?
- No.

109
00:08:17,582 --> 00:08:20,210
Then I think I've answered
all your questions.

110
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:23,254
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have more work than time.

111
00:08:24,381 --> 00:08:25,632
Thank you.

112
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,019
- Did he bite you?
- No, but he tried to.

113
00:08:38,436 --> 00:08:42,899
It's almost five o'clock. We should check
with the housekeeper while we're here.

114
00:08:42,982 --> 00:08:45,694
- No.
- No? What do you mean "no"?

115
00:08:45,777 --> 00:08:48,863
I mean this has reached
the point of absurdity, Mulder.

116
00:08:48,947 --> 00:08:52,158
We're here on half a hunch,
off of a cryptic phone call...

117
00:08:52,242 --> 00:08:54,994
...chasing down a clue
that's based on speculation.

118
00:08:55,078 --> 00:08:57,080
Well, that's all we've got.

119
00:08:57,163 --> 00:09:00,625
That's all he's given us.
Who is this Deep Throat character?

120
00:09:00,709 --> 00:09:04,170
We don't know anything about him,
what his name is, what he does...

121
00:09:04,254 --> 00:09:07,215
His position is delicate.
He has access to information.

122
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:09,384
An indiscretion could expose him.

123
00:09:09,467 --> 00:09:12,011
You don't know
this isn't just a game with him.

124
00:09:12,095 --> 00:09:14,931
He's toying with you,
rationing out the facts.

125
00:09:15,014 --> 00:09:17,350
You think he does it
because he gets off on it?

126
00:09:17,434 --> 00:09:18,643
No.

127
00:09:18,727 --> 00:09:20,979
I think he does it because you do.

128
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:45,628
Calling it a night, Mr Mulder?

129
00:09:47,005 --> 00:09:51,217
My mother usually likes me home
before the streetlights come on.

130
00:09:52,135 --> 00:09:54,220
- I'm surprised at you.
- Why?

131
00:09:54,304 --> 00:09:58,016
- Your level of commitment has diminished.
- My level of commitment?

132
00:09:58,099 --> 00:10:02,020
I'd have expected you to work all night
trying to put the pieces together.

133
00:10:02,103 --> 00:10:05,482
Well, maybe if you'd given me
something more to work with...

134
00:10:05,565 --> 00:10:08,777
- I've given you all I can.
- A news report?

135
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,154
- And where has it led you?
- Not very far.

136
00:10:11,237 --> 00:10:13,323
It may be further than you realise.

137
00:10:13,406 --> 00:10:16,159
You know, from day one
this has been on your terms.

138
00:10:16,242 --> 00:10:18,453
I've gone along, been the dutiful son.

139
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:21,331
Maybe this time we can
cut the Obi-Wan Kenobi crap

140
00:10:21,414 --> 00:10:22,999
and you can save me the trouble.

141
00:10:23,082 --> 00:10:25,960
I fear you've become too dependent on me.

142
00:10:26,044 --> 00:10:30,215
Let me tell you, I've got plenty to do
without chasing down your vague leads...

143
00:10:30,298 --> 00:10:32,634
...or trying to decode your circular logic.

144
00:10:32,717 --> 00:10:35,512
Maybe it's you who's become
too dependent on me...

145
00:10:35,595 --> 00:10:37,847
...on my willingness to play your games.

146
00:10:39,474 --> 00:10:41,559
- Mr Mulder?
- What?

147
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:45,104
Don't give up on this one.

148
00:10:45,188 --> 00:10:48,066
Trust me. You've never been closer.

149
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:49,984
Closer to what?

150
00:11:14,425 --> 00:11:15,593
Hello?

151
00:11:16,761 --> 00:11:18,304
Hello?

152
00:11:18,388 --> 00:11:19,931
Who's there?

153
00:11:20,014 --> 00:11:21,933
Working late tonight, Doctor?

154
00:11:23,351 --> 00:11:25,436
What do you want here?

155
00:11:30,817 --> 00:11:32,902
He's alive, isn't he?

156
00:11:33,736 --> 00:11:36,281
- Has he contacted you?
- Please...

157
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:40,034
You're going to have to leave.

158
00:11:45,248 --> 00:11:48,877
If you're from the FBI,
I've already answered your questions!

159
00:11:49,294 --> 00:11:50,753
What questions?

160
00:11:50,837 --> 00:11:52,714
I had nothing to say to them.

161
00:11:52,797 --> 00:11:54,841
I have nothing to say to you.

162
00:11:54,924 --> 00:11:56,759
Where's Dr Secare?

163
00:11:57,552 --> 00:12:00,013
I don't know what you're talking about.

164
00:12:01,556 --> 00:12:03,057
Please...

165
00:12:04,392 --> 00:12:06,477
My work is very important.

166
00:12:07,478 --> 00:12:09,564
I must get on with my work.

167
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:13,860
I'm afraid... your work is done.

168
00:12:20,408 --> 00:12:22,493
- Anybody see anything?
- No.

169
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:27,665
Nothing.

170
00:12:27,749 --> 00:12:30,501
I'm calling it off.
Get those guys out of the water.

171
00:12:30,585 --> 00:12:32,462
Yes, sir. Shore to RC1.

172
00:12:32,545 --> 00:12:34,589
<i>Bring it in.</i>

173
00:12:50,396 --> 00:12:53,358
- There's nothing down there.
- Three days? Forget it.

174
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:18,299
The county sheriff's office
is conducting the investigation.

175
00:13:18,383 --> 00:13:21,344
On the preliminary reports
it's listed as a suicide.

176
00:13:21,427 --> 00:13:23,012
Suicide?

177
00:13:23,096 --> 00:13:27,266
Yeah. They think that he trashed his lab
and then killed himself.

178
00:13:27,350 --> 00:13:28,726
How?

179
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:34,315
Well, it says he tied one end of a roll
of medical gauze around his neck...

180
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,110
...and the other end to this gas outlet.

181
00:13:37,193 --> 00:13:39,320
Then he jumped.

182
00:13:39,404 --> 00:13:42,657
- I don't suppose there were any witnesses?
- Nope.

183
00:13:43,157 --> 00:13:47,495
The man we met kept this place like he was
waiting for <i>Good Housekeeping</i> to show up.

184
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:49,831
I wouldn't have thought he'd do all this.

185
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:52,000
Or a Greg Louganis out the window.

186
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,627
I know. That gauze is troubling.

187
00:13:55,253 --> 00:13:57,338
It's a bit too calculated, huh?

188
00:13:58,214 --> 00:14:00,925
Almost as if someone
wanted to make doubly sure...

189
00:14:01,009 --> 00:14:03,511
...he'd break his neck
before he hit the ground.

190
00:14:03,594 --> 00:14:05,972
What else do we know about Dr Berube?

191
00:14:06,806 --> 00:14:08,891
Um...

192
00:14:08,975 --> 00:14:12,437
Terrence Allen Berube. Harvard Med, 1974.

193
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,441
He was working on the Human Genome
Project. Are you familiar with that?

194
00:14:16,524 --> 00:14:18,901
Yeah, the mapping of all human genes.

195
00:14:18,985 --> 00:14:23,823
Maybe the most ambitious scientific
endeavour in the history of mankind.

196
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:26,534
Right. But that's nothing extraordinary.

197
00:14:26,617 --> 00:14:29,871
Thousands of scientists
were working on that project.

198
00:14:29,954 --> 00:14:31,998
But only one who had a silver Ciera...

199
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:34,917
...and went bungee jumping
with gauze around his neck.

200
00:14:35,001 --> 00:14:38,713
Sorry, I'm seeing the pieces,
but I'm not seeing the connection.

201
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:44,343
Maybe we're not seeing it because...

202
00:14:44,427 --> 00:14:48,681
...it can't be seen. Not in any obvious way.
What do you think this is?

203
00:14:48,765 --> 00:14:50,767
I don't know.

204
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:54,020
- Can you find out for me?
<i>- </i> What are <i>you</i> gonna do?

205
00:14:54,103 --> 00:14:57,648
See what else I can find out
about Dr Terrence Allen Berube.

206
00:14:57,732 --> 00:15:00,276
OK, Mulder. But I'm warning you...

207
00:15:00,359 --> 00:15:03,279
If this is monkey pee, you're on your own.

208
00:16:03,089 --> 00:16:07,718
My first impression is
it's some kind of bacteria specimen.

209
00:16:07,802 --> 00:16:10,096
Can I ask you where you got it?

210
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:12,431
It was recovered at a crime scene.

211
00:16:13,141 --> 00:16:18,271
We've come a long way from
Colonel Mustard in the den with a rope!

212
00:16:18,354 --> 00:16:21,566
I'm expecting it'll turn out to be nothing.

213
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:23,109
No!

214
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:25,653
No, you've definitely got something here.

215
00:16:26,654 --> 00:16:29,157
Wow! Look at this!

216
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:31,576
What are they?

217
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:34,579
They're the size of bacteria,
but no bacteria I've seen.

218
00:16:34,662 --> 00:16:36,706
How do you mean?

219
00:16:36,789 --> 00:16:40,918
Well, most bacteria are
symmetrical and smooth. These are...

220
00:16:41,002 --> 00:16:43,171
I don't know...

221
00:16:43,254 --> 00:16:44,297
Strange.

222
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:48,426
- You can't identify them?
- Well, we could do a freeze fracture.

223
00:16:48,509 --> 00:16:52,763
Take a thin slice off and see
what's going on inside these babies.

224
00:16:52,847 --> 00:16:56,017
- If you don't mind waiting.
- No. No, I'll wait.

225
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:22,001
Hi, Danny. It's Mulder again.
I got a number this time.

226
00:17:22,084 --> 00:17:25,338
555-2804, area code 301.

227
00:17:25,421 --> 00:17:28,591
I need an address.
A name, if you can get it for me.

228
00:17:28,674 --> 00:17:32,595
All right, I'm at, uh... same prefix, 1517.

229
00:17:33,304 --> 00:17:34,555
Thanks, Danny.

230
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:55,952
<i>- That was fast.</i>
<i>- Terry?</i>

231
00:17:56,035 --> 00:17:58,246
<i>Is that you?</i>

232
00:17:58,329 --> 00:18:00,623
Yeah. Who's this?

233
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:04,627
They shot me, Terry. Oh, God...

234
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:08,089
<i>I've been in the water for three days.</i>
<i>I'm hurt.</i>

235
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:10,967
- Where are you now?
- I'm at a payphone.

236
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:13,052
I'm gonna pick you up. Where are you?

237
00:18:13,135 --> 00:18:15,638
Terry...

238
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:16,764
<i>Hello?</i>

239
00:18:16,847 --> 00:18:18,057
You OK?

240
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,392
Are you there?

241
00:18:19,475 --> 00:18:20,768
<i>Hello?</i>

242
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:25,356
Hello? This man's been hurt.
I think he needs medical attention.

243
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:27,441
What's the street?

244
00:18:27,525 --> 00:18:29,568
- I'm gonna call an ambulance.
<i>- Sir?</i>

245
00:18:35,658 --> 00:18:37,201
Don't hang up.

246
00:18:37,285 --> 00:18:39,870
<i>- I got it.</i>
<i>- Hi, Danny. Let me get...</i>

247
00:18:39,954 --> 00:18:41,831
...the address.

248
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:43,958
<i>- You ready?</i>

249
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:45,960
<i>Mulder?</i>

250
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:48,129
I'm just writing it down.

251
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:51,132
<i>The number belongs to a company</i>
<i>called Zeus Storage.</i>

252
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:55,845
<i>- 1616, Pandora Street.</i>
- Yeah. 1616, Pandora Street.

253
00:18:55,928 --> 00:18:58,556
<i>- That's it.</i>
- Right. Thanks.

254
00:19:05,938 --> 00:19:10,401
OK, we've got a white male. Weak vitals
with severe dyspnoea and hypotension.

255
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:14,739
He also has a green fluid coming from
a wound in his right upper quadrant.

256
00:19:14,822 --> 00:19:17,700
<i>I don't know what that is.</i>
<i>Any response to ventilation?</i>

257
00:19:17,783 --> 00:19:20,619
No. And we're noticing
a hyposonant-sounding chest.

258
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:24,081
- He's going real blue.
<i>- OK. You've got a tension pneumothorax.</i>

259
00:19:24,165 --> 00:19:27,084
<i>Perform a thoracotomy</i>
<i>to release the pressure in his chest.</i>

260
00:19:27,168 --> 00:19:30,546
OK. I need a cannula.
We're gonna do a needle decompression.

261
00:19:37,428 --> 00:19:38,512
Ow!

262
00:19:46,604 --> 00:19:48,856
<i>- Mobile men, what's going on?</i>
- Agh!

263
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:51,025
<i>Mobile men, can you hear me?</i>

264
00:19:54,195 --> 00:19:56,280
<i>Mobile men, answer me!</i>

265
00:19:57,656 --> 00:19:59,950
<i>Mobile men, what is the problem?</i>

266
00:20:00,785 --> 00:20:02,870
<i>Mobile men, come in, please!</i>

267
00:20:05,915 --> 00:20:08,000
<i>- Mulder.</i>
- It's me.

268
00:20:08,084 --> 00:20:10,169
- He's alive, Scully.
<i>- Who?</i>

269
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:14,215
The fugitive. The driver of the silver Ciera.
He called the doctor's house.

270
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:17,426
- Where is he now?
- I don't know. Where are you?

271
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:22,014
I'm at the Georgetown Microbiology
Department. I've got something for you.

272
00:20:22,098 --> 00:20:24,183
<i>Is it smaller than a silver Ciera?</i>

273
00:20:24,266 --> 00:20:25,768
Much.

274
00:20:25,851 --> 00:20:27,937
And it's not silver, it's green.

275
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,063
<i>What is it?</i>

276
00:20:29,146 --> 00:20:31,732
Some kind of bacteria.
Each containing virus.

277
00:20:31,816 --> 00:20:34,652
And it looks as if
Berube may have been cloning them.

278
00:20:34,735 --> 00:20:37,863
<i>They also contain</i>
<i>something like chloroplasts.</i>

279
00:20:37,947 --> 00:20:41,075
Plant cells. But they've
never seen anything like it here.

280
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:43,244
Any idea what he was doing with them?

281
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:46,664
<i>The only reason you'd clone a virus</i>
<i>instead of bacteria...</i>

282
00:20:46,747 --> 00:20:49,458
...is in order to inject it
into something living.

283
00:20:49,542 --> 00:20:53,129
It's called gene therapy
and it's still highly experimental.

284
00:20:53,212 --> 00:20:55,881
Maybe that's what he was doing
with the monkeys.

285
00:20:55,965 --> 00:20:58,050
Can they tell you anything else there?

286
00:20:58,134 --> 00:21:02,555
Yeah. They're just about to run some
primary cell cultures and a DNA sequence.

287
00:21:02,638 --> 00:21:06,517
Now, I may be understating
the strangeness of this, Mulder.

288
00:21:07,226 --> 00:21:09,311
Bacteria like this...

289
00:21:09,395 --> 00:21:12,648
It may have existed,
but not for millions of years.

290
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:17,736
Not since before our ancestors
first crawled out of the sea.

291
00:21:20,906 --> 00:21:22,992
<i>Are you there, Mulder?</i>

292
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:25,161
<i>- Mulder?</i>
- Yeah.

293
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:27,413
Scully, keep up the good work.

294
00:23:38,836 --> 00:23:42,464
- Agent Scully.
- Oh, Dr Carpenter. I fell asleep.

295
00:23:42,548 --> 00:23:44,633
I've done some work.

296
00:23:47,219 --> 00:23:51,432
These are the DNA sequences
from the bacteria sample you brought in.

297
00:23:51,515 --> 00:23:55,477
You know a little about molecular biology.
Do you know what you're looking at?

298
00:23:55,561 --> 00:23:58,147
- Yeah. I think those are genes.
- Right.

299
00:23:58,230 --> 00:24:03,277
They're called base pairs. Each pair
is made up of something called a nucleotide.

300
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:06,280
Only four nucleotides exist in DNA.

301
00:24:06,363 --> 00:24:07,531
Four.

302
00:24:07,615 --> 00:24:11,285
And through some miracle of design
that we have yet to fathom...

303
00:24:11,368 --> 00:24:16,624
...every living thing is created
out of these four basic building blocks.

304
00:24:16,707 --> 00:24:19,001
What you're looking at...

305
00:24:19,084 --> 00:24:22,338
...is a sequence of genes
from the bacteria sample.

306
00:24:22,963 --> 00:24:27,009
Normally, we'd find no gaps
in the sequence.

307
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:29,178
But with these bacteria we do.

308
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:31,305
Why is that?

309
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:33,474
I don't know why.

310
00:24:33,557 --> 00:24:36,435
But I tell you,
under any other circumstances...

311
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:39,355
...my first call would have been
to the government.

312
00:24:39,813 --> 00:24:41,899
What exactly did you find?

313
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:47,154
A fifth and sixth DNA nucleotide.

314
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:50,032
A new base pair.

315
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:53,285
Agent Scully, what you are looking at...

316
00:24:54,036 --> 00:24:56,372
It exists nowhere in nature.

317
00:24:57,289 --> 00:24:59,833
It would have to be by definition...

318
00:24:59,917 --> 00:25:01,877
...extraterrestrial.

319
00:26:10,654 --> 00:26:11,697
Hello?

320
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:12,823
Mulder?

321
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:16,785
Where on earth have you been?
I've been trying to call you all night.

322
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:19,788
<i>I had a situation. I left my phone in the car.</i>

323
00:26:20,789 --> 00:26:22,666
Mulder...

324
00:26:23,167 --> 00:26:25,252
That bacteria I had analysed...

325
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:28,505
They're saying
that it doesn't exist in nature.

326
00:26:30,132 --> 00:26:33,677
<i>They're saying</i>
<i>that it could be extraterrestrial.</i>

327
00:26:33,761 --> 00:26:35,846
- Scully.
- What?

328
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:39,433
<i>How soon can you be here?</i>
<i>There's something I gotta show you.</i>

329
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:57,659
Wait a second.

330
00:26:58,577 --> 00:27:00,245
Mulder?

331
00:27:02,873 --> 00:27:05,042
I just want to say that I was wrong.

332
00:27:05,125 --> 00:27:07,503
That's all right. Don't worry about it.

333
00:27:07,586 --> 00:27:09,046
No. Um...

334
00:27:09,129 --> 00:27:12,424
If you'd have listened to me,
we wouldn't be here right now.

335
00:27:12,508 --> 00:27:15,135
I should know by now
to trust your instincts.

336
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:17,387
Why? Nobody else does.

337
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:23,060
You know,
I've always held science as sacred.

338
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:26,188
I've always put my trust
in the accepted facts.

339
00:27:27,689 --> 00:27:29,775
And what I saw last night...

340
00:27:30,234 --> 00:27:33,779
For the first time in my life,
I don't know what to believe.

341
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:36,698
Well, whatever it is you do believe, Scully...

342
00:27:36,782 --> 00:27:38,909
...when you walk into that room...

343
00:27:38,992 --> 00:27:41,078
...nothing sacred will hold.

344
00:28:00,138 --> 00:28:02,224
There were tanks here...

345
00:28:02,307 --> 00:28:06,979
...and five bodies suspended in solution.
There were computers monitoring them.

346
00:28:07,062 --> 00:28:09,356
They were alive, Scully. Underwater.

347
00:28:09,439 --> 00:28:12,818
- What happened to them?
<i>- </i> God only knows.

348
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:15,320
Most likely they've been destroyed.

349
00:28:16,738 --> 00:28:18,824
Ms Scully, we've met ever so briefly.

350
00:28:18,907 --> 00:28:21,410
- Destroyed by whom?
- I don't know.

351
00:28:21,493 --> 00:28:23,453
I don't believe you.

352
00:28:23,537 --> 00:28:26,039
There are limits to my knowledge,
Mr Mulder.

353
00:28:26,123 --> 00:28:30,502
Inside the intelligence community
there are so-called black organisations.

354
00:28:30,586 --> 00:28:33,839
Groups within groups
conducting covert activities...

355
00:28:33,922 --> 00:28:35,883
...unknown at the highest levels...

356
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:38,093
I was chased by three men last night.

357
00:28:38,176 --> 00:28:42,431
If you were chased, you would have been
killed. Those men are trained for that...

358
00:28:42,514 --> 00:28:44,933
...and they are trained well.

359
00:28:45,017 --> 00:28:48,270
- Were those the men who killed Dr Berube?
- Presumably.

360
00:28:48,353 --> 00:28:50,772
- Why?
- Why?!

361
00:28:50,856 --> 00:28:54,651
Good Lord! You've worked so hard
and you still don't see it!

362
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:59,281
Dr Berube was conducting human
experiments with extraterrestrial viruses.

363
00:28:59,364 --> 00:29:03,744
Yes! But that's been going on for years.
We've had the tissue since 1947...

364
00:29:03,827 --> 00:29:05,495
...but not the technology.

365
00:29:05,579 --> 00:29:06,872
Roswell?

366
00:29:06,955 --> 00:29:11,752
Roswell was a smoke screen. We've had
a half a dozen better salvage operations.

367
00:29:11,835 --> 00:29:15,714
Dr Berube was killed
because his work was too successful.

368
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:19,593
You're standing in the room
where the first DNA transplant took...

369
00:29:19,676 --> 00:29:22,971
...the first human-alien hybrid was created.

370
00:29:24,014 --> 00:29:27,184
Six volunteer patients, all terminally ill.

371
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:28,810
One...

372
00:29:28,894 --> 00:29:33,106
...Dr William Secare, a friend of Dr Berube's,
was dying of melanoma cancer.

373
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:35,901
And as a result of the ET gene therapy...

374
00:29:35,984 --> 00:29:40,989
...all six patients treated in this room
began to recover from their illnesses.

375
00:29:41,073 --> 00:29:44,743
Dr Secare was able to live
a more or less normal life.

376
00:29:44,826 --> 00:29:49,081
As normal as possible for a man
who has developed inhuman strength...

377
00:29:49,164 --> 00:29:51,625
...and the ability to breathe underwater.

378
00:29:51,708 --> 00:29:54,878
- That's how he was able to elude capture.
- Mm.

379
00:29:54,962 --> 00:29:57,214
What was he running from?

380
00:29:57,297 --> 00:30:00,342
Dr Secare was never
supposed to have survived!

381
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:03,136
Dr Berube's research
was part of a top-secret

382
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,972
government project at Los Alamos.

383
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:08,475
All they were interested in
was the technology, the science.

384
00:30:08,558 --> 00:30:11,979
To have a hybrid living out in the real world?

385
00:30:12,062 --> 00:30:14,147
Too great a liability.

386
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:18,026
I mean, what if he should need
emergency medical procedure?

387
00:30:18,110 --> 00:30:22,990
The man has a blood chemistry
that is alien and very likely toxic.

388
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:24,950
If that story hit the press...

389
00:30:25,033 --> 00:30:28,036
- It was just easier to kill Dr Secare.
- Of course.

390
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:31,873
There was only one problem.
Dr Berube was able to warn him.

391
00:30:31,957 --> 00:30:34,459
There's just one thing I don't understand.

392
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:37,546
Why you gave us so little to go on
in the beginning...

393
00:30:37,629 --> 00:30:39,923
...and why you're giving us so much now.

394
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:43,343
I didn't anticipate the speed
of their clean-up operation.

395
00:30:43,427 --> 00:30:46,471
They're systematically
destroying all the evidence.

396
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:48,640
Dr Berube, the bodies here...

397
00:30:48,724 --> 00:30:51,560
Without the evidence,
you two have no case.

398
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:54,104
Who would believe the story I just told you?

399
00:30:54,187 --> 00:30:57,065
You must put together
everything you have found...

400
00:30:57,149 --> 00:31:00,360
...and you must find Dr Secare
before they do.

401
00:31:00,444 --> 00:31:04,072
I'll have no further contact
with you on this matter.

402
00:31:10,454 --> 00:31:13,248
I'm going to Georgetown
to get all the lab work.

403
00:31:13,331 --> 00:31:15,417
I'm gonna find Dr Secare.

404
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:16,543
Where?

405
00:31:16,626 --> 00:31:19,254
I don't know. I'm gonna trust my instincts!

406
00:31:28,472 --> 00:31:30,891
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Dr Ann Carpenter.

407
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:33,769
I can't reach her by phone
and she's not in her office.

408
00:31:33,852 --> 00:31:37,481
She was in a terrible car accident.
Her whole family.

409
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:40,776
And Dr Carpenter is, um... dead.

410
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:33,245
Dr Secare?

411
00:32:49,136 --> 00:32:50,470
Wait!

412
00:32:56,893 --> 00:32:58,562
I'll protect you.

413
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,947
Agh!

414
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:43,023
Your cellular phone's
been ringing off the hook.

415
00:33:44,524 --> 00:33:46,610
I'm a popular guy.

416
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:49,362
Why don't you answer it for me?

417
00:33:49,446 --> 00:33:51,865
Oh, I don't like talking on the phone.

418
00:33:52,574 --> 00:33:55,327
I have this thing about unsecured lines.

419
00:33:56,703 --> 00:34:00,248
When <i>you</i> feel like talking,
let me know, though.

420
00:34:14,638 --> 00:34:16,223
He's not home.

421
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,976
Where is he? He's been gone all night.

422
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,603
I wish I knew.

423
00:34:21,686 --> 00:34:23,772
Something's happened to him.

424
00:34:23,855 --> 00:34:26,441
- They won't kill him.
- How do you know that?

425
00:34:26,524 --> 00:34:31,363
He's become too high-profile and you've
got evidence that could expose them.

426
00:34:31,446 --> 00:34:35,784
I don't have any! They took the evidence
and may have killed in order to get it.

427
00:34:35,867 --> 00:34:36,993
Listen to me.

428
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:39,204
- Evidence still exists.
- Where?

429
00:34:39,287 --> 00:34:42,874
It may be difficult to obtain,
but with your medical background...

430
00:34:42,958 --> 00:34:45,961
- ..I might be able to get you inside.
- Inside where?

431
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:49,130
High containment facility,
Fort Marlene, Maryland.

432
00:34:49,214 --> 00:34:52,509
- What do they have there?
- The wellspring, Ms Scully.

433
00:34:52,592 --> 00:34:54,344
The original tissue.

434
00:34:55,053 --> 00:34:59,391
If they've got Agent Mulder,
they might be willing to make a deal.

435
00:34:59,474 --> 00:35:01,184
It could save his life.

436
00:35:32,882 --> 00:35:35,010
Clear.

437
00:37:01,471 --> 00:37:02,764
<i>Name?</i>

438
00:37:06,601 --> 00:37:07,977
Dana Scully.

439
00:37:08,061 --> 00:37:10,897
<i>- Company or institution?</i>
- Federal government.

440
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:12,273
<i>Project password?</i>

441
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:23,785
<i>Project password?</i>

442
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:28,081
Purity control.

443
00:37:49,519 --> 00:37:51,604
Log in, please.

444
00:40:08,783 --> 00:40:10,326
You're late.

445
00:40:10,410 --> 00:40:13,079
- Do you have it?
- Yes.

446
00:40:13,162 --> 00:40:16,040
Good. They're willing to make the exchange.

447
00:40:16,124 --> 00:40:18,960
- You spoke to them?
- Yes.

448
00:40:19,043 --> 00:40:21,879
- I'll take the parcel.
- No, sir.

449
00:40:21,963 --> 00:40:24,048
I'll make the exchange.

450
00:40:24,132 --> 00:40:27,218
I made the deal, Scully.
They're expecting me.

451
00:40:27,302 --> 00:40:30,388
- I don't trust you.
- You've got no one else to trust!

452
00:40:30,471 --> 00:40:33,641
I don't know who you are.
I know nothing about you.

453
00:40:33,725 --> 00:40:37,687
Oh, for God's sake! Don't screw this up!
Let me tell you something.

454
00:40:37,770 --> 00:40:43,151
In 1987 a group of children were given what
they thought was a routine inoculation.

455
00:40:43,234 --> 00:40:45,320
What they were injected with...

456
00:40:45,403 --> 00:40:50,450
...was a clone DNA from the contents
of that package you're holding, as a test.

457
00:40:50,533 --> 00:40:52,702
That's the people you're dealing with!

458
00:40:52,785 --> 00:40:56,831
- So why give it back to them?
- To save Mulder's life!

459
00:40:56,914 --> 00:41:00,543
- At the risk of so many other lives?
- It's the tip of the iceberg.

460
00:41:00,627 --> 00:41:04,505
You and Mulder must bring it to light.
Now give me the parcel.

461
00:41:13,097 --> 00:41:15,099
Give me the parcel, Scully!

462
00:42:03,981 --> 00:42:05,024
No!

463
00:42:14,992 --> 00:42:16,911
Mulder! Mulder!

464
00:42:30,007 --> 00:42:31,718
Trust...

465
00:42:37,056 --> 00:42:41,769
Trust... no one.

466
00:43:30,818 --> 00:43:32,653
Hello?

467
00:43:32,737 --> 00:43:34,822
<i>Hey, Scully, it's me.</i>

468
00:43:34,906 --> 00:43:36,532
Where are you?

469
00:43:38,451 --> 00:43:40,703
They're shutting us down, Scully.

470
00:43:40,787 --> 00:43:42,121
What?

471
00:43:42,205 --> 00:43:44,290
<i>They called me in tonight.</i>

472
00:43:45,208 --> 00:43:48,628
They said they're gonna
reassign us to other sections.

473
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:51,255
Who told you that?

474
00:43:51,339 --> 00:43:52,840
Skinner.

475
00:43:54,133 --> 00:43:57,553
He said word came down
from the top of the Executive Branch.

476
00:43:57,637 --> 00:43:58,888
Mulder...

477
00:43:58,971 --> 00:44:02,183
- It's over, Scully.
- Well, you have to lodge a protest.

478
00:44:02,266 --> 00:44:04,352
<i>- They can't...</i>
- Yes, they can.

479
00:44:05,978 --> 00:44:08,064
What are you gonna do?

480
00:44:09,273 --> 00:44:11,150
I'm...

481
00:44:12,652 --> 00:44:15,655
...not gonna give up. I can't give up.

482
00:44:19,742 --> 00:44:22,119
Not as long as the truth is out there.

483
00:45:16,215 --> 00:45:19,427
Sarah Emery

484
00:45:45,953 --> 00:45:47,622
<i>I made this!</i>
