1
00:00:27,029 --> 00:00:29,531
What's she doing there by herself?

2
00:00:38,081 --> 00:00:39,917
Tina?

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,668
Honey?

4
00:00:43,086 --> 00:00:45,672
You're freezing. Where's your jacket?

5
00:00:45,756 --> 00:00:47,591
Where's your daddy?

6
00:00:47,674 --> 00:00:51,303
In the yard. He told me
he needed some time to himself.

7
00:00:52,012 --> 00:00:54,097
I'd say his time's up.

8
00:00:54,181 --> 00:00:58,101
Come on, honey, I'm sure
he wouldn't want you to catch cold.

9
00:00:59,478 --> 00:01:01,021
Joel?

10
00:01:04,942 --> 00:01:09,529
Hey, Joel, the swing set's supposed
to be for your daughter, not you!

11
00:01:12,032 --> 00:01:14,117
I'll call 911.

12
00:01:23,168 --> 00:01:24,836
Daddy?

13
00:02:20,767 --> 00:02:23,228
Death by hypovolemia.

14
00:02:23,312 --> 00:02:25,897
75% blood loss.

15
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:28,108
That's over four litres of blood.

16
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:31,528
You could say
the man was running on empty.

17
00:02:32,321 --> 00:02:34,865
The man's daughter, eight years old...

18
00:02:34,948 --> 00:02:38,327
...was away from his side
for no more than 10 minutes.

19
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:40,495
She doesn't remember anything.

20
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:42,456
There was no trace evidence.

21
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:45,751
It would've been washed away
by yesterday's rain.

22
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:48,920
There were two puncture wounds
in the jugular.

23
00:02:49,004 --> 00:02:52,758
Are you familiar
with the phenomenon of cattle mutilations?

24
00:02:52,841 --> 00:02:54,301
Hmm?

25
00:02:54,384 --> 00:02:56,011
Since 1967...

26
00:02:56,094 --> 00:03:00,724
...over 34 states have reported
unsolved cases of cattle mutilation.

27
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:05,187
The trace evidence is remarkably similar.

28
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:08,106
Incision marks of surgical precision.

29
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,819
The area around the mouth and often
the sexual organs has been removed.

30
00:03:12,903 --> 00:03:15,197
There's substantial blood loss...

31
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,157
...with no blood at the scene.

32
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:19,910
- How can that be?
- Exsanguination.

33
00:03:19,993 --> 00:03:24,748
If you stuck a needle in the jugular,
the heart itself would act as a pump.

34
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:27,793
These animals
had their jugulars punctured...

35
00:03:27,876 --> 00:03:30,712
...in the same way as the man
from Connecticut.

36
00:03:30,796 --> 00:03:33,840
It's the first time
I've ever seen it on a human.

37
00:03:33,924 --> 00:03:35,967
There was no sign of a struggle.

38
00:03:36,051 --> 00:03:38,512
How can a man sit through a blood-letting?

39
00:03:38,595 --> 00:03:40,347
The ME found digitalis...

40
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:44,142
...a South American plant
that can be used as a paralytic drug.

41
00:03:44,226 --> 00:03:47,896
These X-Files indicate
this is a UFO-related phenomenon.

42
00:03:47,979 --> 00:03:51,191
Often there are sightings nearby,
surface burns.

43
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:54,444
Witnesses report time loss,
as in abduction cases.

44
00:03:54,528 --> 00:03:57,656
That might explain why
the girl remembers nothing.

45
00:03:57,739 --> 00:04:00,826
Why would aliens
travel light years to Earth...

46
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:03,203
...in order to play doctor on cattle?

47
00:04:03,286 --> 00:04:07,457
For the same reason
we cut up frogs and monkeys.

48
00:04:08,083 --> 00:04:09,584
Besides...

49
00:04:09,668 --> 00:04:12,796
...they seem to have
stepped up their interest.

50
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:32,399
Her mother passed away
from ovarian cancer two years ago.

51
00:04:32,482 --> 00:04:34,484
There's no other family.

52
00:04:34,568 --> 00:04:38,780
We'll keep Tina here until we can
place her with a foster family.

53
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:43,869
- Has she spoken about it?
- No, not a word.

54
00:04:43,952 --> 00:04:47,289
- Any nightmares?
- No. At least not that I know of.

55
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:55,380
- Can we talk to her now?
- Yes.

56
00:04:57,966 --> 00:04:59,634
Tina...

57
00:05:01,761 --> 00:05:03,555
...these are the people we talked about.

58
00:05:03,638 --> 00:05:08,226
This is Miss Scully and Mr Mulder.
Do you think you can talk to them?

59
00:05:09,186 --> 00:05:10,896
OK.

60
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,902
Hi.

61
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,239
I know you must be feeling
very sad right now.

62
00:05:21,323 --> 00:05:22,949
And scared.

63
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:26,745
But we wanna find out what happened
so we can help stop...

64
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:28,788
...whoever hurt your daddy, OK?

65
00:05:30,248 --> 00:05:31,791
OK.

66
00:05:34,127 --> 00:05:37,714
Did you ever see any strangers
with your daddy at home?

67
00:05:40,634 --> 00:05:43,553
Did you ever see anyone
yell at your daddy...

68
00:05:43,637 --> 00:05:45,597
...or your daddy yell at them?

69
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,641
No.

70
00:05:47,724 --> 00:05:50,644
Can you think of anyone
who might wanna hurt him?

71
00:05:50,727 --> 00:05:53,230
No.

72
00:05:53,313 --> 00:05:55,273
That's a nice bunny, Tina.

73
00:05:57,692 --> 00:06:00,445
Can we talk about what happened that day?

74
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:04,074
About what happened
in the back yard. Yeah?

75
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:09,162
Do you remember
any strange sounds or lights...

76
00:06:09,246 --> 00:06:11,331
...or anything like that?

77
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:16,753
There was red lightning.

78
00:06:18,672 --> 00:06:21,967
Can you tell me more
about the red lightning?

79
00:06:22,050 --> 00:06:23,677
I can't remember.

80
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:26,012
It... all went dark.

81
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:29,975
Have you ever seen
anything like that before?

82
00:06:31,142 --> 00:06:33,019
You have? When?

83
00:06:34,104 --> 00:06:37,941
The men from the clouds -
they were after my dad.

84
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:45,282
Scully.

85
00:06:45,365 --> 00:06:48,827
- Where?
- Why were these men after your dad?

86
00:06:50,036 --> 00:06:52,497
They wanted to exsanguinate him.

87
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:54,624
Thanks. Mulder.

88
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:55,917
What?

89
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:04,259
There's been another one.

90
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,608
It's like looking at a mirror image.

91
00:07:21,151 --> 00:07:25,280
"The victim, Doug Reardon,
was married with one daughter."

92
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:27,824
"Cause of death - hypovolemia."

93
00:07:27,907 --> 00:07:29,951
Mulder, this is uncanny.

94
00:07:30,035 --> 00:07:33,163
They also found traces
of the poison digitalis.

95
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:36,750
- Puncture wound?
- Uh... yes.

96
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,918
On the jugular.

97
00:07:39,961 --> 00:07:42,964
Time of death was estimated at 2.30pm.

98
00:07:43,048 --> 00:07:46,926
The same day, only three hours earlier
than the Simmons murder.

99
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:51,473
That's Pacific Standard Time.
That makes it the exact same moment.

100
00:07:52,515 --> 00:07:56,061
It appears we've two serial killers
working in tandem.

101
00:07:56,144 --> 00:07:58,813
No, serial killers rarely work in pairs.

102
00:07:58,897 --> 00:08:02,067
When they do, they kill together,
not separately.

103
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:05,236
Nothing beyond
your leading questions to Tina...

104
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,989
...substantiates a UFO mutilation theory.

105
00:08:08,073 --> 00:08:11,368
Was Reardon's daughter here
when he was murdered?

106
00:08:11,451 --> 00:08:13,078
Yes.

107
00:08:13,161 --> 00:08:16,706
The police report states
that she remembers nothing.

108
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:21,044
Uh, she's with her mother and family
in Sacramento.

109
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:25,548
- When will they be back?
- Um... tomorrow.

110
00:08:25,632 --> 00:08:28,301
Even money she'll remember red lightning.

111
00:10:10,153 --> 00:10:11,821
Tina?

112
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:14,741
Tina?

113
00:10:18,578 --> 00:10:20,246
Tina!

114
00:10:22,624 --> 00:10:24,292
Tina!

115
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:40,433
She was kidnapped from the Social Services
home at 11pm last night.

116
00:10:40,517 --> 00:10:44,270
Looks like someone was afraid
she might remember too much.

117
00:10:44,354 --> 00:10:46,439
Someone or something, Scully.

118
00:10:46,523 --> 00:10:50,693
Connecticut state troopers set up
roadblocks within half an hour.

119
00:10:50,777 --> 00:10:51,820
Nothing.

120
00:10:51,903 --> 00:10:55,073
Maybe they weren't looking
in the right direction!

121
00:10:55,156 --> 00:10:58,201
I told them to contact us
in case they find her.

122
00:11:05,834 --> 00:11:07,460
Tina?

123
00:11:07,544 --> 00:11:09,629
No.

124
00:11:10,588 --> 00:11:12,632
Wh-What's your name?

125
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:14,717
Cindy Reardon.

126
00:11:14,801 --> 00:11:17,303
Do you live here, Cindy?

127
00:11:17,387 --> 00:11:19,597
Ever since I was born - eight years ago.

128
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:28,356
<i>Ahhhh!</i>

129
00:11:38,074 --> 00:11:40,910
<i>This is the ceremonial signing...</i>

130
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:50,336
Cindy really is a beautiful
little girl, Mrs Reardon.

131
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,672
Doug and I wanted to spoil her.

132
00:11:52,755 --> 00:11:56,968
We wanted to protect her from
everything horrible in the world.

133
00:12:01,556 --> 00:12:05,184
- She was daddy's little girl.
- Is she an only child?

134
00:12:07,854 --> 00:12:10,940
May I ask... was Cindy adopted?

135
00:12:11,024 --> 00:12:13,067
No!

136
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:15,653
I gave birth to her...

137
00:12:15,737 --> 00:12:17,572
...at San Rafael General.

138
00:12:17,655 --> 00:12:21,618
I assume you have the documentation,
birth certificate...

139
00:12:21,701 --> 00:12:24,829
- Of course I do.
- Was she the only child delivered?

140
00:12:24,913 --> 00:12:27,415
What the hell kind of question is that?

141
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:31,127
Look, I have told the police
everything I know.

142
00:12:32,462 --> 00:12:35,673
Mrs Reardon,
have you ever seen this man before?

143
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,304
Is this your suspect?

144
00:12:41,387 --> 00:12:43,640
- No.
- Did he do something to Cindy?

145
00:12:43,723 --> 00:12:45,350
- No, h-he...
- No.

146
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:47,268
Mrs Reardon...

147
00:12:47,352 --> 00:12:49,437
...this is not your daughter.

148
00:12:50,355 --> 00:12:52,523
That girl's name is Tina Simmons.

149
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:56,027
She lives 3,000 miles away
in Greenwich, Connecticut.

150
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:00,323
That man, her father, was killed
in the same way as your husband.

151
00:13:01,491 --> 00:13:03,576
Cindy is my daughter.

152
00:13:05,828 --> 00:13:08,039
I can show you videos of her birth.

153
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:12,001
We tried for six years to become pregnant.

154
00:13:12,085 --> 00:13:13,962
In vitro fertilisation?

155
00:13:16,547 --> 00:13:20,134
- At which clinic?
- Luther Stapes Center...

156
00:13:20,218 --> 00:13:22,095
...down in San Francisco.

157
00:13:24,722 --> 00:13:26,766
Do you still believe...

158
00:13:26,849 --> 00:13:28,685
...this is UFO related?

159
00:13:28,768 --> 00:13:31,896
- Cindy didn't see red lightning.
- I don't know.

160
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:36,317
The only thing similar about these girls
seems to be their appearance.

161
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:40,113
There is the possibility
they have an unrelated likeness.

162
00:13:40,196 --> 00:13:43,741
Both just happen to see
their fathers exsanguinated.

163
00:13:43,825 --> 00:13:46,536
I'd like to get the odds on that in Vegas!

164
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:59,424
The girls are the one and only link
between identical murders.

165
00:13:59,507 --> 00:14:02,969
- And one girl was just abducted.
- Kidnapped.

166
00:14:03,052 --> 00:14:04,971
Potato, po-tah-to

167
00:14:05,054 --> 00:14:07,265
Where are you going?

168
00:14:07,348 --> 00:14:10,518
If the murders were committed
by the same person...

169
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:13,730
...part of the pattern is
kidnapping the daughter.

170
00:14:13,813 --> 00:14:16,274
You expect the pattern to continue.

171
00:14:16,357 --> 00:14:19,318
I'll keep an eye on the girl.
Check out the clinic.

172
00:14:19,402 --> 00:14:22,155
See if the Simmons
were in the same programme.

173
00:14:22,238 --> 00:14:25,992
I'll call the San Francisco Bureau
and get someone to relieve you.

174
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:27,744
OK.

175
00:14:28,995 --> 00:14:33,916
<i>In vitro fertilisation is a procedure</i>
<i>in which we implement fertilisation...</i>

176
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,253
...and implantation of the embryo
in the uterus.

177
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:41,049
Could a patient believe
she was receiving her own egg...

178
00:14:41,132 --> 00:14:43,801
...but receive another without knowing?

179
00:14:43,885 --> 00:14:46,471
Not here. We have very strict controls.

180
00:14:46,554 --> 00:14:50,433
Have you ever had patients
named Claudia and Joel Simmons?

181
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:54,228
Any patient information is confidential.
It's our policy.

182
00:14:54,312 --> 00:14:57,899
The Simmons are dead.
Their daughter has been kidnapped.

183
00:14:57,982 --> 00:15:02,361
I'd say any information that could help
would override your policy.

184
00:15:05,031 --> 00:15:07,283
You had copies of their records...

185
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:10,787
...transferred to Greenwich,
Connecticut in 1991.

186
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:20,505
They came here nine years ago under
the supervision of a Dr Sally Kendrick?

187
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:24,884
Is there a problem?

188
00:15:27,637 --> 00:15:30,556
Dr Kendrick was nothing but a problem.

189
00:15:32,683 --> 00:15:37,146
<i>Hello. Welcome to the Luther Stapes Center</i>
<i>for Reproductive Medicine.</i>

190
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,315
<i>I'm Dr Sally Kendrick...</i>

191
00:15:39,398 --> 00:15:43,653
<i>..a specialist in the exciting field</i>
<i>of in vitro fertilisation.</i>

192
00:15:43,736 --> 00:15:46,197
She was a resident here in 1985.

193
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,324
Brilliant.

194
00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:51,994
First in her class at Yale Med
where she got her MD...

195
00:15:52,078 --> 00:15:55,456
...after completing her doctorate
in biogenetics.

196
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,042
We were thrilled to get her.

197
00:15:58,126 --> 00:16:00,378
And now you don't sound so thrilled.

198
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:02,880
We have reason to believe...

199
00:16:02,964 --> 00:16:08,052
...Dr Kendrick was tampering with
the genetic material of fertilised ova...

200
00:16:08,136 --> 00:16:10,596
...in the lab prior to implant.

201
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,141
Experimenting with eugenics.

202
00:16:13,224 --> 00:16:16,352
- Did you report this to the AMA?
- Of course.

203
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:21,357
I fired her. I also requested an investigation
from the US Health Department.

204
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,403
- And what happened?
- The AMA censured her.

205
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:28,948
My request for an investigation was denied.

206
00:16:31,492 --> 00:16:34,453
Dr Kendrick... disappeared.

207
00:16:34,537 --> 00:16:39,292
<i>We know the pain</i>
<i>of infertility, and we are ready to help.</i>

208
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,460
<i>In the next half-hour...</i>

209
00:16:41,544 --> 00:16:44,881
Kendrick was
the supervising physician...

210
00:16:44,964 --> 00:16:48,301
...in the Reardons'
<i>and</i> the Simmons' IVF programme.

211
00:16:48,384 --> 00:16:51,387
It seems she was experimenting
at the clinic.

212
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:55,266
And maybe now
she's trying to erase the results?

213
00:16:55,349 --> 00:17:01,063
<i>..But with our scientific advances,</i>
<i>a little luck and a lot of hope...</i>

214
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:03,733
<i>..miracles</i> can <i>happen.</i>

215
00:17:03,816 --> 00:17:06,402
She must've had an accomplice...

216
00:17:06,485 --> 00:17:08,571
...to have done both murders.

217
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:12,909
You think this is a vendetta she
and a colleague have against the Center?

218
00:17:14,911 --> 00:17:18,456
Does this mean you've abandoned
your UFO connection?

219
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:20,458
- Hello?

220
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:22,835
Hello?

221
00:17:24,212 --> 00:17:27,423
Just a couple of clicks.
Must be a wrong number.

222
00:17:27,506 --> 00:17:30,968
I tell you what, I'm gonna sleep on it...

223
00:17:31,052 --> 00:17:33,721
...and we'll talk about it in the morning.

224
00:17:33,804 --> 00:17:36,557
Mulder, you're rushing me out of the room.

225
00:17:36,641 --> 00:17:38,684
No, I'm not.

226
00:17:38,768 --> 00:17:41,854
- Do you have a girl coming over?
- What's a girl?

227
00:17:41,938 --> 00:17:43,981
I got a movie I wanna watch on TV.

228
00:17:44,065 --> 00:17:46,776
Sleep tight. I'll see you in the morning.

229
00:18:02,458 --> 00:18:05,127
Are you certain she hasn't followed you?

230
00:18:05,211 --> 00:18:07,505
Yes. What are you doing here?

231
00:18:08,256 --> 00:18:12,009
Well, I thought we might
take in a Warriors game.

232
00:18:13,094 --> 00:18:16,013
Actually, I was... uh...

233
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:19,517
...just in the neighbourhood and...

234
00:18:21,143 --> 00:18:26,524
...wondered if I had ever told you
about the Litchfield experiments.

235
00:18:26,607 --> 00:18:28,234
Hmm.

236
00:18:28,317 --> 00:18:30,403
No, you haven't.

237
00:18:31,988 --> 00:18:36,701
Well, it was a most... interesting project.

238
00:18:36,784 --> 00:18:42,164
Highest level of classification,
all records have since been destroyed...

239
00:18:42,248 --> 00:18:44,500
...and those who knew of it...

240
00:18:44,583 --> 00:18:47,712
...will deny knowledge of its existence.

241
00:18:47,795 --> 00:18:51,424
In the early '50s,
during the height of the Cold War...

242
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:55,469
...we got wind the Russians were
fooling around with eugenics.

243
00:18:55,553 --> 00:18:57,722
Rather primitively, I might add.

244
00:18:57,805 --> 00:19:03,227
Trying to cross-breed top scientists,
athletes, you name it...

245
00:19:04,312 --> 00:19:07,940
...to come up with the superior soldier.

246
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:11,319
Naturally, we jumped on the bandwagon.

247
00:19:11,402 --> 00:19:13,904
The Litchfield experiment.

248
00:19:13,988 --> 00:19:18,159
<i>Mm-hm. A group</i>
<i>of genetically controlled children...</i>

249
00:19:18,242 --> 00:19:21,829
<i>.. were raised and monitored</i>
<i>on a compound in Litchfield.</i>

250
00:19:21,912 --> 00:19:23,998
<i>The boys were called Adam...</i>

251
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,128
<i>..and the girls were called... Eve.</i>

252
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:33,049
<i>There's a woman you should see...</i>

253
00:19:33,132 --> 00:19:35,718
<i>..and I'll make sure that you can get in.</i>

254
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:38,763
Agents Mulder and Scully here to see Eve 6.

255
00:19:39,847 --> 00:19:41,932
Deposit your firearms.

256
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:45,353
- Sign for these.
- What are those?

257
00:19:46,228 --> 00:19:49,774
Panic buttons.
I can't let you inside without one.

258
00:20:11,712 --> 00:20:13,756
Whaddaya want?

259
00:20:40,116 --> 00:20:41,951
Why the flashlight?

260
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:45,246
She screams and screams
if we turn the overheads on.

261
00:20:45,329 --> 00:20:47,706
No-one's ever got a good look at her.

262
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:54,547
We'll be right outside.

263
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:05,391
Hello?

264
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:19,572
So, I guess you've found
what you're looking for.

265
00:21:26,495 --> 00:21:29,081
One of us, at least.

266
00:21:32,126 --> 00:21:34,003
Sally Kendrick.

267
00:21:42,803 --> 00:21:45,556
Unlock the chains, then we'll talk.

268
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:47,725
Probably there for a good reason.

269
00:21:47,808 --> 00:21:50,102
No... a bad reason.

270
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:53,314
I paid too much attention to a guard.

271
00:21:53,397 --> 00:21:55,483
Bit into his eyeball!

272
00:21:59,236 --> 00:22:01,530
I meant it as a sign of affection.

273
00:22:07,286 --> 00:22:10,039
You here to give me an IQ test,
by any chance?

274
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:11,749
I think I can top 265.

275
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:13,876
We're very bright, we Eves.

276
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:16,003
It runs in the family.

277
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:19,298
Where are the others -
the Adams and the Eves?

278
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,636
We're prone to suicide.

279
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:26,555
All that's left is me...

280
00:22:26,639 --> 00:22:29,016
...and Eve 7 - she escaped early on.

281
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:32,645
Eve 8, she escaped 10 years later.

282
00:22:33,854 --> 00:22:35,689
Are you Sally Kendrick?

283
00:22:35,773 --> 00:22:37,858
That's not my name...

284
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:41,654
...but... she is me and I am her...

285
00:22:41,737 --> 00:22:45,199
...and we are all together!

286
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:49,119
Did you work for
the Luther Stapes Center in 1985?

287
00:22:49,203 --> 00:22:50,829
In 1985...

288
00:22:50,913 --> 00:22:54,875
...I'd been tied up like this for two years!
And for what reason?

289
00:22:54,959 --> 00:22:57,044
No reason! I did nothing!

290
00:22:58,837 --> 00:23:00,673
I'm just me!

291
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:04,051
They made me, but did they suffer?

292
00:23:04,134 --> 00:23:06,595
No, no, I suffer!

293
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:08,138
I suffer!

294
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:10,599
They keep me alive...

295
00:23:10,683 --> 00:23:13,477
...for the Litchfield Project!

296
00:23:13,561 --> 00:23:15,813
They come in, they test me...

297
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:18,732
...they poke me to see what went wrong!

298
00:23:20,943 --> 00:23:23,237
Sally knows what went wrong.

299
00:23:25,906 --> 00:23:28,284
You and you...

300
00:23:28,367 --> 00:23:30,411
...you have 46 chromosomes.

301
00:23:30,494 --> 00:23:32,538
The Adams made the Eves.

302
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:34,665
We have 56.

303
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:37,001
We have extra chromosomes.

304
00:23:37,084 --> 00:23:40,004
Number 4, 512, 16 and 22.

305
00:23:40,087 --> 00:23:44,633
This replication of chromosomes
also produces additional genes.

306
00:23:44,717 --> 00:23:46,760
Heightened strength...

307
00:23:46,844 --> 00:23:48,971
...heightened intelligence...

308
00:23:49,054 --> 00:23:51,181
Heightened psychosis.

309
00:23:51,265 --> 00:23:53,851
Saved the best for last.

310
00:23:58,939 --> 00:24:00,983
You don't believe me.

311
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:04,403
I have proof. Look on my wall.

312
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:07,948
My family album.

313
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:14,038
My God, it's the girls!

314
00:24:14,121 --> 00:24:16,165
We were close...

315
00:24:16,248 --> 00:24:18,834
...we were very close!

316
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:24,715
Sally Kendrick was using the clinic
to carry on the Litchfield experiment.

317
00:24:26,008 --> 00:24:28,093
She was cloning herself.

318
00:24:31,639 --> 00:24:33,974
Now I lay me down to sleep...

319
00:24:34,058 --> 00:24:36,185
...I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

320
00:24:36,977 --> 00:24:39,438
If I should die before I wake...

321
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:41,607
...I pray the Lord my soul to take.

322
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:44,693
God bless Grandma and Grandpa Stenner...

323
00:24:44,777 --> 00:24:46,820
...Irma and Irmapop...

324
00:24:46,904 --> 00:24:48,947
...and God bless Mom...

325
00:24:49,031 --> 00:24:51,992
...and please take care of Daddy
up in heaven.

326
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:55,788
You're such a special little girl, Cindy.

327
00:25:11,303 --> 00:25:13,180
Good night, honey.

328
00:25:21,105 --> 00:25:24,900
If Eve 6 is right and there are
two other Eves out there...

329
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:30,197
...that could account for the two identical
murders occurring at exactly the same time.

330
00:25:31,699 --> 00:25:35,703
Sally Kendrick <i>does</i> have
an accomplice - herself.

331
00:25:35,786 --> 00:25:38,914
Until I heard that,
I'd begun to suspect the girls.

332
00:25:38,997 --> 00:25:43,877
No, it seems the two remaining Eves
are doing away with the parents...

333
00:25:43,961 --> 00:25:47,089
...in order to keep Tina and Cindy
in the family.

334
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:22,958
Do you suppose the girls have
any idea of what they are?

335
00:26:24,877 --> 00:26:26,545
I hope not.

336
00:26:35,929 --> 00:26:37,097
Let's go!

337
00:26:38,974 --> 00:26:40,851
I'll take the back!

338
00:26:44,188 --> 00:26:46,815
There's someone upstairs. Wait outside!

339
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,385
FBI! I'm armed!

340
00:27:17,471 --> 00:27:20,516
Which one are you - Eve 7 or Eve 8?

341
00:27:20,599 --> 00:27:22,851
Drop it.

342
00:27:22,935 --> 00:27:25,020
You know I'm capable.

343
00:27:26,605 --> 00:27:28,232
Slow.

344
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:29,983
Very slow.

345
00:27:52,256 --> 00:27:54,758
The suspect's name is Sally Kendrick.

346
00:27:54,842 --> 00:27:57,594
Early 40s, five foot eight, 135 pounds.

347
00:27:57,678 --> 00:28:00,973
She may have an accomplice
similar in appearance.

348
00:28:01,056 --> 00:28:03,976
Kendrick is driving a light-blue '93 Corolla.

349
00:28:04,059 --> 00:28:07,020
She has exceptional strength for her size...

350
00:28:07,104 --> 00:28:09,648
...so consider her armed and dangerous.

351
00:28:09,731 --> 00:28:13,777
Quite possibly she'll display
severe psychotic behaviour.

352
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:18,282
The Oakland Bureau will orchestrate
the search across the bridge.

353
00:28:18,365 --> 00:28:21,493
What if... What if she kills her?

354
00:28:22,536 --> 00:28:24,371
First Doug, now Cindy.

355
00:28:24,454 --> 00:28:29,042
The fact that Kendrick and her accomplice
just abducted the girls...

356
00:28:29,126 --> 00:28:31,253
...tells us they want them alive.

357
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:34,131
I'm sure Cindy's alive and we'll find her.

358
00:28:40,053 --> 00:28:42,139
And then what do we do?

359
00:29:13,587 --> 00:29:16,048
I'm sorry you have to meet this way...

360
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:20,844
...but it's the best for all concerned.

361
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:33,357
Tina Simmons...

362
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,525
...meet Cindy Reardon.

363
00:29:47,496 --> 00:29:49,122
Agent Scully?

364
00:29:49,206 --> 00:29:54,127
They found the Corolla in the parking lot
of San Francisco International.

365
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:57,339
Start a check on
every single passenger list...

366
00:29:57,422 --> 00:30:00,467
...for every flight that left
in the past 12 hours.

367
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:04,930
Check every terminal, make sure
she's not hiding out for a later flight.

368
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:07,516
Remember, she may have an accomplice.

369
00:30:07,599 --> 00:30:11,770
A motel in Port Reyes has a guest
matching Sally's description.

370
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:15,232
- The car's at the airport.
- She might've ditched it.

371
00:30:15,315 --> 00:30:18,151
The manager says
she checked in with a girl.

372
00:30:18,235 --> 00:30:22,572
She left the hotel in the afternoon alone,
then returns with the girl.

373
00:30:22,656 --> 00:30:26,243
Someone else could've picked her up
without him knowing.

374
00:30:26,326 --> 00:30:30,455
The area is full of families.
There are hundreds of kids around.

375
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:32,874
This kid told him to use chlorine...

376
00:30:32,958 --> 00:30:36,628
...to eradicate the dinoflagellates
in the swimming pool.

377
00:30:36,712 --> 00:30:40,382
- Does that sound like someone you know?
- That's it.

378
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:44,970
I've always kept a close eye
on your behaviour, no matter where I was.

379
00:30:45,053 --> 00:30:48,849
The last few years I spent
in search of the remaining Eve.

380
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:52,853
That, however, was cut short
by your... "activity".

381
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:57,691
I hoped my work at the Stapes Center
had corrected the Litchfield flaws.

382
00:30:57,774 --> 00:31:02,195
Psychotic behaviour didn't develop
in the Adams and Eves until age 16.

383
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:04,364
Homicidal behaviour at 20.

384
00:31:05,657 --> 00:31:08,744
Imagine my... disappointment...

385
00:31:08,827 --> 00:31:12,497
...when I learned of
your accelerated development.

386
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:21,923
How did you learn
of each other's existence?

387
00:31:22,007 --> 00:31:24,092
We just knew.

388
00:31:24,176 --> 00:31:26,178
Did you discuss...

389
00:31:26,261 --> 00:31:29,639
...how you would orchestrate
your little... prank?

390
00:31:29,723 --> 00:31:31,600
We just knew.

391
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:34,519
Why murder your fathers?

392
00:31:39,524 --> 00:31:43,028
- They weren't our fathers.
- We have no parents.

393
00:31:43,111 --> 00:31:44,988
We weren't born.

394
00:31:45,072 --> 00:31:47,115
We were created.

395
00:31:47,199 --> 00:31:49,034
You...

396
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:51,620
You cannot think that way.

397
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:54,623
You're human beings.

398
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:56,958
Different, special...

399
00:31:57,042 --> 00:32:00,796
...but you cannot give in to genetic destiny.

400
00:32:00,879 --> 00:32:02,923
That's why I've taken you.

401
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:05,675
I was raised by a man who knew what I was.

402
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:08,970
He was a genetic engineer on the project.

403
00:32:09,805 --> 00:32:12,265
With the proper environment...

404
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:16,520
...and a programme...
of long-term medication...

405
00:32:17,437 --> 00:32:19,481
...you can become like me...

406
00:32:19,564 --> 00:32:21,191
...and...

407
00:32:21,274 --> 00:32:23,360
...not the other Eves.

408
00:32:39,376 --> 00:32:41,419
Wh-What have you done?

409
00:32:41,503 --> 00:32:43,130
Your soda...

410
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:45,465
...four ounces of foxglove.

411
00:32:45,549 --> 00:32:47,134
Extracted...

412
00:32:47,217 --> 00:32:49,052
...from a digitalis plant...

413
00:32:49,136 --> 00:32:51,388
...this much is a lethal dose.

414
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:54,015
We cultivated them ourselves.

415
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:55,976
Wh-Why?

416
00:32:56,059 --> 00:32:58,812
- You tell us.
- You made us.

417
00:32:58,895 --> 00:33:00,981
We're your mistake.

418
00:33:04,401 --> 00:33:05,819
I'll...

419
00:33:05,902 --> 00:33:09,239
...c-correct... that mistake!

420
00:33:31,595 --> 00:33:35,307
Well, I waited like you told me.
No-one's come in or out.

421
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:38,101
Get the back!

422
00:34:10,884 --> 00:34:15,222
We were all supposed to drink,
but we only pretended to drink it.

423
00:34:15,305 --> 00:34:17,390
They tried to poison us.

424
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:19,517
Who's "they"?

425
00:34:19,601 --> 00:34:22,270
She and another lady.

426
00:34:22,354 --> 00:34:25,482
What did the other lady look like?

427
00:34:30,779 --> 00:34:32,405
Eve 8.

428
00:34:32,489 --> 00:34:34,574
They were working together.

429
00:34:40,163 --> 00:34:42,832
It's all right, we'll take care of you.

430
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:44,793
You're safe with us.

431
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:05,355
Looks like the Eves mixed
about four ounces of digitalis in each glass.

432
00:35:05,438 --> 00:35:07,691
Their own mini-Jonestown.

433
00:35:07,774 --> 00:35:10,694
Eve 6 said they were prone to suicide.

434
00:35:10,777 --> 00:35:14,906
It has a sweet flavour, probably
not even perceptible in soda.

435
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:19,327
We're searching the area, but so far
there's no sign of the other suspect.

436
00:35:19,411 --> 00:35:21,663
An officer'll take the girls back.

437
00:35:21,746 --> 00:35:25,458
Maybe it'd be best if <i>we</i> take
responsibility for the girls.

438
00:35:25,542 --> 00:35:28,044
We can get them checked out by a doctor.

439
00:35:28,128 --> 00:35:30,213
OK, whatever.

440
00:35:34,759 --> 00:35:37,512
Come on, girls, we're gonna take you back.

441
00:35:37,595 --> 00:35:40,432
- Back where?
- What's gonna happen to Tina?

442
00:35:40,515 --> 00:35:42,726
We'll talk about it in the car, OK?

443
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:52,652
They've already grown so attached.

444
00:35:52,736 --> 00:35:55,572
It's gonna be hard
when Tina's placed in care.

445
00:35:55,655 --> 00:35:56,698
Yeah.

446
00:36:20,889 --> 00:36:23,767
Agent Mulder, I have to go to the bathroom.

447
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,894
Me, too.

448
00:36:25,977 --> 00:36:29,022
- Can you hold it?
- I really need to go.

449
00:36:29,981 --> 00:36:32,067
I could use some caffeine.

450
00:36:43,411 --> 00:36:45,038
Hi.

451
00:36:45,121 --> 00:36:49,000
- Where's your bathroom?
- In the back. You'll need a key.

452
00:36:49,084 --> 00:36:50,710
Thanks.

453
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:54,964
- Oh, can I get four diet sodas?
<i>- </i> Regular.

454
00:36:55,048 --> 00:36:59,344
All right, uh, two diet
and two regular to go, please.

455
00:36:59,427 --> 00:37:00,762
Thanks.

456
00:37:26,162 --> 00:37:28,665
Agent Scully, my door's stuck.

457
00:37:28,748 --> 00:37:30,834
Just a second.

458
00:37:42,345 --> 00:37:43,847
Just a minute.

459
00:37:43,930 --> 00:37:48,852
It's OK, my dad will pay for them
when he gets out of the bathroom.

460
00:37:48,935 --> 00:37:50,145
OK.

461
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:14,794
- Those are the diet?
- I think these are.

462
00:38:18,506 --> 00:38:20,592
Are you sure? It's really sweet.

463
00:38:20,675 --> 00:38:23,553
- Try it.
- I know it's diet. I saw her pour it.

464
00:38:23,636 --> 00:38:26,473
- OK.
<i>- </i> Let's go.

465
00:38:28,683 --> 00:38:29,976
Come on.

466
00:38:31,936 --> 00:38:35,273
- Don't forget the drinks.
- Right.

467
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,404
- How much?
- $5.

468
00:38:42,947 --> 00:38:44,991
- Wanna pay?
- Sure.

469
00:38:45,074 --> 00:38:46,951
There you go.

470
00:38:47,994 --> 00:38:49,621
You got those?

471
00:38:49,704 --> 00:38:51,372
Thanks.

472
00:39:05,762 --> 00:39:07,639
Tastes syrupy.

473
00:39:12,685 --> 00:39:15,688
Cindy, did you pick up my keys
off the counter?

474
00:39:15,772 --> 00:39:17,190
No.

475
00:39:17,273 --> 00:39:19,776
No? All right, I'll be right back.

476
00:39:55,395 --> 00:39:58,147
- Scully!
- What?

477
00:39:58,231 --> 00:39:59,899
Scully...

478
00:40:02,569 --> 00:40:05,238
Just wanted to open the car door for you.

479
00:40:08,825 --> 00:40:10,577
Mulder!

480
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:15,456
It's them. They poisoned it.
Let's just get them in the car.

481
00:40:16,958 --> 00:40:18,793
I only had a sip.

482
00:40:18,876 --> 00:40:21,421
We didn't drink enough to make us sick.

483
00:41:16,017 --> 00:41:17,852
Scully, I got 'em!

484
00:41:17,935 --> 00:41:19,896
- Leave us alone!
- I got 'em!

485
00:41:19,979 --> 00:41:21,564
Scully!

486
00:41:21,648 --> 00:41:23,733
Hey!

487
00:41:25,234 --> 00:41:28,780
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm a federal agent!

488
00:41:28,863 --> 00:41:31,991
Yeah, and these
are America's Most Wanted?

489
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:34,452
- Hands in front.
- Leave me alone!

490
00:41:34,535 --> 00:41:38,539
- Let the girls go!
- Get in the truck, girls. Get in.

491
00:41:38,623 --> 00:41:41,793
- I'm gonna call the police.
- We <i>are</i> the police!

492
00:41:41,876 --> 00:41:43,002
Mulder!

493
00:41:52,929 --> 00:41:54,806
They went that way!

494
00:42:00,853 --> 00:42:02,897
You seen the twins we were with?

495
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:04,440
No, I...

496
00:42:05,692 --> 00:42:09,862
There's a bunch of schoolkids
just left on that bus.

497
00:42:52,989 --> 00:42:54,490
Forget your sodas?

498
00:42:54,574 --> 00:42:58,077
- We didn't do anything wrong.
- We're just little girls.

499
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:00,246
That's the last thing you are.

500
00:43:05,001 --> 00:43:09,088
They said they have an excellent
programme that can help her.

501
00:43:09,672 --> 00:43:13,009
They can't hide behind a bureaucracy,
Mrs Reardon.

502
00:43:13,092 --> 00:43:17,930
You have a right to know what happened,
a right to know about your daughter.

503
00:43:18,014 --> 00:43:21,142
All I need to know is
she was not my daughter.

504
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:25,646
She never was.

505
00:43:51,964 --> 00:43:53,841
Hello, girls.

506
00:44:09,148 --> 00:44:11,818
It's so nice to have company.

507
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,077
Sign for this.

508
00:44:55,194 --> 00:44:56,988
Hello, Eve 8.

509
00:44:59,657 --> 00:45:01,492
We've been waiting.

510
00:45:01,576 --> 00:45:03,744
How did you know I'd come for you?

511
00:45:03,828 --> 00:45:06,747
- We just knew.
- We just knew.

512
00:45:14,171 --> 00:45:17,091
Pam Atkinson

513
00:45:44,327 --> 00:45:47,121
<i>I made this!</i>
