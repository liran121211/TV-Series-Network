1
00:00:36,371 --> 00:00:38,790
Lauren, I've been looking every...

2
00:00:40,918 --> 00:00:42,920
Are you all right?

3
00:00:43,003 --> 00:00:46,089
- Do you want some water or...
- No, I-I'm fine.

4
00:00:46,798 --> 00:00:48,592
Oh, honey...

5
00:00:48,675 --> 00:00:50,844
...it's been a couple of weeks now.

6
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:53,472
- Do you wanna talk?
- No.

7
00:00:54,514 --> 00:00:59,478
Really, Jane, I'm OK. I just haven't
known a lot of people who've died.

8
00:00:59,603 --> 00:01:03,482
I've never known anybody
that killed themselves.

9
00:01:03,607 --> 00:01:07,361
Oh, well, maybe once everything
gets packed away...

10
00:01:07,486 --> 00:01:11,448
...it'll get easier, there won't be
the constant reminder.

11
00:01:12,491 --> 00:01:14,534
Here's your paycheque.

12
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:18,247
Oh, come on... go home.

13
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:19,998
OK.

14
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:13,719
Ahh!

15
00:02:19,224 --> 00:02:21,226
I have no money!

16
00:02:21,351 --> 00:02:23,353
Ahh! No, let me go!

17
00:02:23,437 --> 00:02:25,564
No!

18
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:32,571
Ugh!

19
00:02:32,696 --> 00:02:35,198
I think I'll pass.

20
00:02:38,076 --> 00:02:41,121
Hey, I know a good place to crash.

21
00:02:41,246 --> 00:02:43,248
Up the fire escape...

22
00:02:43,373 --> 00:02:45,208
...through that window.

23
00:02:45,292 --> 00:02:47,419
Come on, I'll give you a boost.

24
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:52,174
Pull it down.

25
00:02:52,257 --> 00:02:54,885
- I can't get it down.
- Come on, pull!

26
00:03:02,392 --> 00:03:04,603
- Come on!

27
00:03:04,728 --> 00:03:06,396
Hurry up!

28
00:04:15,715 --> 00:04:17,759
Agent Scully, Agent Mulder.

29
00:04:17,843 --> 00:04:20,929
Chief Blevins assures us
of your cooperation.

30
00:04:21,012 --> 00:04:22,973
We regret any inconvenience.

31
00:04:23,056 --> 00:04:26,601
We hope your expertise
in extraordinary phenomenon...

32
00:04:26,685 --> 00:04:29,229
...will help us answer some questions.

33
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,357
You're not FBI, are you?

34
00:04:34,526 --> 00:04:37,863
Have you ever analysed
anything like this before?

35
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:48,498
Abnormal postmortem muscle reflex.

36
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:53,753
Both corpses are still responding
to exposure to high levels...

37
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:56,506
...of electrostatic charge.

38
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,758
Any external lesions or surface burns?

39
00:04:58,884 --> 00:05:01,553
- None.
- Time of death?

40
00:05:06,016 --> 00:05:08,977
Well, it can't be long. The body's still warm.

41
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,814
Somatic death occurred
sometime over six hours ago...

42
00:05:12,898 --> 00:05:17,402
...but their body temperatures
have yet to drop below 98.3 degrees.

43
00:05:18,236 --> 00:05:20,280
Where did you find them?

44
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,161
Tell us the time and mode of transport.

45
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:29,956
It might help us determine
why the bodies haven't cooled.

46
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:32,709
Hey, you guys called us down here.

47
00:05:32,792 --> 00:05:35,712
You want some answers,
you gotta give some.

48
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,470
They travelled 60 minutes by air.

49
00:05:43,595 --> 00:05:45,472
Thank you.

50
00:05:45,597 --> 00:05:49,226
The most troubling aspect
of the deaths is the throat area.

51
00:05:49,309 --> 00:05:52,938
Larynx, oesophagus and hyoid bone
were crushed like chalk.

52
00:05:53,063 --> 00:05:55,106
There's no abrasions...

53
00:05:55,232 --> 00:05:57,776
...or evidence of tissue damage.

54
00:05:57,901 --> 00:06:00,362
It's as if their throats were crushed...

55
00:06:00,445 --> 00:06:02,572
...from the inside.

56
00:06:04,824 --> 00:06:06,785
Who are these guys?

57
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:12,707
If you've done your examinations,
why are you consulting us?

58
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:16,419
During your work on the X-Files,
ever seen anything like this?

59
00:06:16,503 --> 00:06:18,630
No, never.

60
00:06:20,465 --> 00:06:24,135
Thank you very much for your time,
Agent Mulder, Scully.

61
00:06:24,261 --> 00:06:28,473
If any inquiry as to this meeting
be made, we request full denial.

62
00:06:28,598 --> 00:06:32,978
I'd say you people already suffer
from full denial.

63
00:06:44,197 --> 00:06:46,032
You lied.

64
00:06:46,157 --> 00:06:49,494
You <i>have</i> seen it before, I can tell.
You lied to them.

65
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:51,413
I would never lie.

66
00:06:51,496 --> 00:06:55,458
I wilfully participated
in a campaign of misinformation.

67
00:06:56,501 --> 00:06:58,295
Who do you think they were?

68
00:06:58,378 --> 00:07:02,716
NSA, CIA, some organisation
Congress will uncover in the next scandal.

69
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:05,260
But what's important is what they have.

70
00:07:05,343 --> 00:07:07,971
They have no idea because they called us in.

71
00:07:08,054 --> 00:07:11,516
I have X-Files. Each case
has an element of what we saw.

72
00:07:11,641 --> 00:07:16,187
Electrostatic charge, internal mutilation
with no external causality.

73
00:07:16,313 --> 00:07:18,398
None has all the elements in one case.

74
00:07:18,523 --> 00:07:21,985
How can an oesophagus be crushed
without the neck being touched?

75
00:07:22,068 --> 00:07:24,195
Psychokinetic manipulation.

76
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,365
Psychokinesis?

77
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:29,951
You mean,
how Carrie got even at the prom?

78
00:07:30,035 --> 00:07:32,245
The Russians were doing studies on it.

79
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:35,915
The Chinese still are.
Their findings are kept secret.

80
00:07:41,046 --> 00:07:43,089
OK, I'm intrigued.

81
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:46,593
But how can we investigate?
We have nothing to go on.

82
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,584
Just getting in, Lauren?

83
00:08:19,709 --> 00:08:21,461
Oh! Yes.

84
00:08:21,586 --> 00:08:27,008
Mr Graves used to let you get away
with that, but Mr Dorlund is in charge now.

85
00:08:27,092 --> 00:08:29,928
I wondered if I could have
a minute with him.

86
00:08:32,931 --> 00:08:34,974
Tomorrow...

87
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:37,227
...at three.

88
00:08:37,310 --> 00:08:40,063
Can I see him today? It's really important.

89
00:08:51,241 --> 00:08:54,119
Is everything all right out here?

90
00:08:54,244 --> 00:08:56,079
- Can I speak with you?
- Mm.

91
00:09:06,798 --> 00:09:08,299
Please.

92
00:09:12,804 --> 00:09:16,099
Um... I'm here to give my two-week notice.

93
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:18,309
Ah.

94
00:09:19,686 --> 00:09:23,648
Lauren, Jane told me about you crying
in Howard's office...

95
00:09:23,773 --> 00:09:27,360
...and I... I want you to know
you're not alone.

96
00:09:27,485 --> 00:09:29,487
As a matter of fact...

97
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:31,656
...we share something special.

98
00:09:33,992 --> 00:09:37,996
Howard and I started this company
ten years ago...

99
00:09:38,121 --> 00:09:42,584
...and as long as I knew him, he had
no interest in anything but work...

100
00:09:42,667 --> 00:09:45,378
...and so some of us became family.

101
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:49,674
I was his brother and
you were like a daughter to him...

102
00:09:51,301 --> 00:09:55,388
...so, of course, I feel very close to you.

103
00:09:55,513 --> 00:09:57,515
And I...

104
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,684
I wanna take care of my family.

105
00:10:01,686 --> 00:10:04,230
Stay, Lauren, please.

106
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:06,357
The company needs you...

107
00:10:06,483 --> 00:10:08,359
...especially now.

108
00:10:12,489 --> 00:10:14,240
I won't let you leave!

109
00:10:18,828 --> 00:10:20,038
What's wrong?

110
00:10:26,503 --> 00:10:30,256
I... uh... I can't. I have to leave.

111
00:10:30,381 --> 00:10:32,842
I... I can't be here anymore.

112
00:10:34,344 --> 00:10:36,387
You've got two weeks.

113
00:10:40,266 --> 00:10:42,101
Mohammed Amrollahi.

114
00:10:42,227 --> 00:10:45,355
Illegal possession of firearms...

115
00:10:45,438 --> 00:10:49,984
...illegal possession of explosives,
falsification of export licences.

116
00:10:50,068 --> 00:10:53,363
He has ties to an exiled
extremist group - the Isfahan.

117
00:10:53,446 --> 00:10:58,701
Named after a city in Iran, they've
been working out of Philadelphia...

118
00:10:58,785 --> 00:11:00,578
That's 60 air minutes.

119
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,041
I'll talk to the Philly PD.

120
00:11:05,124 --> 00:11:09,295
It was last Wednesday night.
I was just on routine patrol.

121
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,214
This is where we found 'em.

122
00:11:11,297 --> 00:11:13,967
- Who discovered their bodies?
- Nobody.

123
00:11:14,092 --> 00:11:17,762
It was about 10. I was on patrol.
Saw them hangin' around.

124
00:11:17,887 --> 00:11:19,472
No witnesses?

125
00:11:19,597 --> 00:11:22,809
The people that come here
after business hours...

126
00:11:22,934 --> 00:11:26,104
...don't witness very much,
know what I'm sayin'?

127
00:11:26,229 --> 00:11:29,399
- I appreciate your help.

128
00:11:43,288 --> 00:11:47,417
A daily visual record is made
of everyone who makes a transaction.

129
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,044
We'll just have to question everyone...

130
00:11:50,128 --> 00:11:53,464
...who was at the machine
before 10 that night.

131
00:11:57,302 --> 00:11:59,637
There. Back up.

132
00:12:06,978 --> 00:12:10,231
"Lauren Kyte, 858 Franklin, Bensalem."

133
00:12:10,315 --> 00:12:15,486
Why would the Isfahan rob someone
of 40 bucks at an ATM machine?

134
00:12:15,612 --> 00:12:17,488
Look at that!

135
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:20,617
Maybe it's another person.

136
00:12:21,784 --> 00:12:23,828
Maybe... maybe not.

137
00:12:26,164 --> 00:12:30,501
Well, the resolution's too poor.
It won't help much to enhance it.

138
00:12:30,627 --> 00:12:34,547
That leaves us only one person
we know we can talk to.

139
00:12:44,349 --> 00:12:46,017
Come on.

140
00:13:16,881 --> 00:13:18,716
Hello?

141
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:20,760
Ms Lauren Kyte, please.

142
00:13:22,387 --> 00:13:25,515
I'm Agent Fox Mulder,
this is Agent Dana Scully.

143
00:13:25,598 --> 00:13:28,476
We're with the FBI.
Do you mind if we come in?

144
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:32,563
- I was just in the middle of...
- Thank you. We won't be long.

145
00:13:39,404 --> 00:13:42,073
Ever seen either of these two men before?

146
00:13:45,618 --> 00:13:46,869
No.

147
00:13:46,953 --> 00:13:48,871
Take your time.

148
00:13:52,709 --> 00:13:55,962
I-I'm sorry, I've never seen them before.

149
00:13:56,087 --> 00:13:58,131
I'm afraid you have.

150
00:14:00,550 --> 00:14:03,136
It's a surveillance picture from your ATM.

151
00:14:03,261 --> 00:14:05,722
Can you tell us what happened that night?

152
00:14:05,805 --> 00:14:07,473
Um...

153
00:14:08,933 --> 00:14:12,270
These guys...
I-I was depositing my paycheque...

154
00:14:12,395 --> 00:14:14,689
...they grabbed me, I got away, I ran.

155
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:17,275
I-I just didn't wanna file a report.

156
00:14:18,818 --> 00:14:20,486
They were found dead.

157
00:14:23,573 --> 00:14:26,117
Have you ever seen <i>this</i> person before?

158
00:14:34,417 --> 00:14:36,085
No.

159
00:14:37,128 --> 00:14:39,130
I'm sorry, I can't tell you.

160
00:14:39,255 --> 00:14:41,299
Does that mean you know?

161
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,762
Uh... It-it means I...

162
00:14:45,845 --> 00:14:48,222
I can't tell you who it is.

163
00:14:48,306 --> 00:14:50,349
When you can tell me...

164
00:14:50,475 --> 00:14:53,603
...this is a number
I can be reached at any time.

165
00:14:54,937 --> 00:14:56,814
- OK?
- Mm-hm.

166
00:15:10,161 --> 00:15:13,873
A woman her size breaking free
and outrunning those men?

167
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:16,334
Then somehow crushing their necks?

168
00:15:21,005 --> 00:15:23,174
She knows who the other person is.

169
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:26,135
She's packing, running away. From what?

170
00:15:32,975 --> 00:15:35,895
What's happening?
What the hell's going on?

171
00:15:37,688 --> 00:15:39,816
Hang on!

172
00:15:48,699 --> 00:15:50,284
You OK?

173
00:15:50,368 --> 00:15:51,869
Yeah.

174
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:20,273
Hi.

175
00:16:20,398 --> 00:16:22,900
Hi. Paramedics check you out?

176
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,194
I'm fine, though I have

177
00:16:25,278 --> 00:16:27,905
a standing-in-line-at-the-DMV-sized
headache.

178
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,032
Mine's more IRS-sized.

179
00:16:30,116 --> 00:16:33,911
- They check out the car?
- Yeah. It's brand-new, only 100 miles.

180
00:16:34,036 --> 00:16:37,498
Then someone tampered with it
while we were in her house.

181
00:16:37,582 --> 00:16:41,961
Mechanic says everything's in order -
nothing cut, nothing greased.

182
00:16:42,086 --> 00:16:43,754
Check out the lights.

183
00:16:47,425 --> 00:16:48,926
They're on.

184
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:53,931
No, the filaments are heated due to
huge levels of electrostatic charge...

185
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:56,100
...like the bodies in the morgue.

186
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:58,769
Isn't it interesting that Lauren Kyte...

187
00:16:58,895 --> 00:17:00,605
...was present both times?

188
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,441
She was with us the entire time
we were at her house.

189
00:17:03,566 --> 00:17:08,154
What if it's possible somehow to raise
the body's electrostatic charge...

190
00:17:08,279 --> 00:17:12,158
...to the levels we've seen
and use that energy to affect objects?

191
00:17:12,283 --> 00:17:15,203
If a person <i>could</i> generate
that much energy...

192
00:17:15,286 --> 00:17:18,497
...their body would break down,
they'd start glowing.

193
00:17:18,623 --> 00:17:22,418
There's evidence in the X-Files -
furniture moving untouched...

194
00:17:22,501 --> 00:17:26,422
...objects levitating,
unexplained electrical discharges.

195
00:17:26,505 --> 00:17:29,634
Frequently, people with
psychokinetic power...

196
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:32,303
...are unaware of their own capability.

197
00:17:32,428 --> 00:17:35,514
Are you saying Lauren Kyte crashed our car?

198
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:38,726
Either that... or a poltergeist.

199
00:17:38,809 --> 00:17:42,605
- They're here!
- They may be.

200
00:17:42,688 --> 00:17:46,400
Oh, come on, Mulder,
look at the tangible evidence.

201
00:17:46,484 --> 00:17:49,153
Two Mid-East extremists were killed...

202
00:17:49,278 --> 00:17:52,073
...trying to assault a woman working for...

203
00:17:52,156 --> 00:17:55,243
...a manufacturer of parts
for the Defense Department.

204
00:17:55,326 --> 00:17:58,412
When we questioned her,
our car was sabotaged.

205
00:17:58,496 --> 00:18:01,540
Someone else may have
committed both acts.

206
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:04,710
Maybe the same someone
we saw in the ATM photos.

207
00:18:04,835 --> 00:18:08,089
The mystery isn't psychokinetic energy...

208
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:10,299
...it's her accomplice.

209
00:18:36,575 --> 00:18:38,619
Excuse me, sir...

210
00:18:38,703 --> 00:18:40,329
She's clean.

211
00:18:40,413 --> 00:18:42,915
No arrests, not even a traffic ticket.

212
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:47,920
Only thing is, she's in deep
with her credit card company. $15,000.

213
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:52,591
What do you think you're doing?
What are you doing? No, no.

214
00:18:52,717 --> 00:18:54,844
I'll take care of this, all right?

215
00:18:54,927 --> 00:18:56,345
Just go!

216
00:18:56,429 --> 00:18:58,556
Here. I-I'll talk to someone.

217
00:18:58,681 --> 00:19:02,893
A little upset over losing
a parking space, wouldn't you say?

218
00:19:05,771 --> 00:19:08,524
So who is Howard Graves, anyway?

219
00:19:22,747 --> 00:19:24,790
She was his secretary.

220
00:19:24,915 --> 00:19:27,668
That's three people dead in the last month...

221
00:19:27,752 --> 00:19:29,920
...associated with Lauren Kyte.

222
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:05,414
You won't find too many people
at their boss's grave...

223
00:20:05,498 --> 00:20:07,541
...who aren't dancing on it.

224
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,460
Look at this one.

225
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:16,467
Excuse me.

226
00:20:16,592 --> 00:20:20,721
Sir, is there an office
where I can get some information...

227
00:20:20,805 --> 00:20:22,431
...on those people?

228
00:20:22,515 --> 00:20:23,933
Who?

229
00:20:24,016 --> 00:20:26,060
I attend every funeral.

230
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:29,188
I'm the last person to see them put to rest.

231
00:20:29,313 --> 00:20:34,151
Do you know how Sarah Lynn
was related to Howard Graves?

232
00:20:34,276 --> 00:20:35,403
His daughter.

233
00:20:35,486 --> 00:20:37,738
They were at home one day...

234
00:20:37,822 --> 00:20:41,492
...and he didn't latch the pool gate.

235
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:43,411
She drowned.

236
00:20:43,494 --> 00:20:45,538
His wife left him a year later.

237
00:20:45,663 --> 00:20:48,833
She's buried in a plot
in the northeast corner.

238
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,585
Thank you, sir.

239
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:53,337
You're welcome.

240
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:00,302
She was only three years old.

241
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,224
If she'd lived, she'd be Lauren's age.

242
00:21:36,005 --> 00:21:39,675
<i>Further investigation</i>
<i>into Lauren's history...</i>

243
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:42,386
<i>..reveals an estrangement from her family.</i>

244
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:46,182
<i>Phone records confirm no contact</i>
<i>with her parents for two years.</i>

245
00:21:46,265 --> 00:21:50,603
<i>Her actions, during surveillance,</i>
<i>indicate a strong relationship...</i>

246
00:21:50,728 --> 00:21:54,648
<i>..between Lauren and her employer,</i>
<i>the late Howard Graves.</i>

247
00:21:54,732 --> 00:21:58,027
<i>Did this relationship</i>
<i>somehow motivate his suicide?</i>

248
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,945
<i>How are the attack...</i>

249
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:04,658
<i>..and the subsequent murders</i>
<i>of the Isfahan agents related, if at all?</i>

250
00:22:04,742 --> 00:22:07,828
<i>I am certain the answers</i>
<i>to these questions...</i>

251
00:22:07,912 --> 00:22:11,582
<i>..lie in finding the identify</i>
<i>of Lauren's accomplice.</i>

252
00:22:29,808 --> 00:22:31,936
Enhance it by 10.

253
00:22:42,613 --> 00:22:44,990
That's Howard Graves.

254
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:46,784
He's alive.

255
00:22:47,785 --> 00:22:49,912
Not necessarily.

256
00:23:58,564 --> 00:24:01,317
No... No!

257
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:05,904
Stop!

258
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:08,073
Stop!

259
00:24:10,492 --> 00:24:12,995
Don't do this to me!

260
00:24:14,371 --> 00:24:16,415
Howard?

261
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:23,213
No!

262
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:24,923
No! Stop!

263
00:24:25,049 --> 00:24:26,592
No, no!

264
00:24:26,717 --> 00:24:28,719
Please, no!

265
00:25:06,965 --> 00:25:09,259
Howard!

266
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:13,430
They killed him!

267
00:25:16,809 --> 00:25:20,437
I think Howard Graves
fabricated his own death.

268
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:23,899
Do you know how difficult it is
to fake your own death?

269
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:27,069
Only one man has pulled it off - Elvis!

270
00:25:27,152 --> 00:25:29,321
He and Lauren are in on something.

271
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:33,575
Maybe an illegal dealing,
something the CIA was interested in.

272
00:25:33,659 --> 00:25:35,285
You may be right.

273
00:25:35,411 --> 00:25:36,578
Wait!

274
00:25:36,662 --> 00:25:38,497
You think I'm right?

275
00:25:38,622 --> 00:25:42,626
Sure. All you gotta do is prove
Howard Graves is still alive.

276
00:25:44,128 --> 00:25:47,089
Howard Graves is very dead.

277
00:25:47,923 --> 00:25:50,676
May we see the autopsy report, please?

278
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:53,345
Knock yourself out.

279
00:25:55,472 --> 00:25:58,183
"Cause of death - arterial haemorrhage."

280
00:25:58,308 --> 00:26:00,102
Four out of six litres of blood...

281
00:26:00,185 --> 00:26:02,146
...down the tub.

282
00:26:04,481 --> 00:26:07,568
There seems to be some blood work
missing here.

283
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:10,237
We only do that if we suspect homicide.

284
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,906
I don't suppose you ran
dental confirmations?

285
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:16,368
- What for? It was him.
- How did you know?

286
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:19,413
It said so on the toe tag.

287
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:22,458
Who made positive ID on the body?

288
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:26,545
Lauren Kyte.

289
00:26:28,547 --> 00:26:30,340
But Graves was cremated.

290
00:26:30,466 --> 00:26:35,179
There's no way to run a dental check
or get a DNA sample.

291
00:26:35,304 --> 00:26:39,349
Yes, there is. His body's tissues
and organs were donated.

292
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:44,188
Howard Graves is in five different people.

293
00:26:44,313 --> 00:26:47,733
They harvested the organs
immediately after death.

294
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:52,654
His kidneys went to Boston, his liver
to Dallas and his corneas to Oregon.

295
00:26:52,738 --> 00:26:54,823
They've all been transplanted.

296
00:26:54,907 --> 00:26:59,578
We cryo-preserved the dura mater -
the membrane of the spinal column.

297
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:01,914
We have Graves' hospital records.

298
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:04,917
We'll extract a sample and, in two hours...

299
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:07,461
...confirm the identity of the donor.

300
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,052
I, uh, made them rush...

301
00:27:15,177 --> 00:27:18,388
...so you could have your cheque
before you leave.

302
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:21,767
Aw, I'm gonna miss you.

303
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:28,649
Aw, what?

304
00:27:28,732 --> 00:27:30,400
Here.

305
00:27:32,444 --> 00:27:34,112
Bye.

306
00:28:24,413 --> 00:28:28,166
You were gonna leave
without saying goodbye?

307
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:31,461
Well, uh, I came to say goodbye...

308
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:33,630
...and to wish you luck.

309
00:28:34,965 --> 00:28:37,759
And to leave you with this little thought.

310
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,554
I know Howard told you...

311
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:42,681
...and if it ever gets out...

312
00:28:42,806 --> 00:28:46,977
...I won't waste my time
trying to pin the source.

313
00:28:47,102 --> 00:28:48,812
I'll go straight to you.

314
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:52,274
And you'll do to me
what you did to Howard?

315
00:28:52,357 --> 00:28:56,862
- I know you had him killed.
- Why would you say that?

316
00:28:56,987 --> 00:28:58,655
He told me.

317
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:23,764
Mulder.

318
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:26,516
Lauren Kyte.
How soon can you be at my house?

319
00:29:26,642 --> 00:29:28,685
- Why?
- Please hurry.

320
00:29:34,358 --> 00:29:38,362
The tests are conclusive.
The dura mater does belong to Graves.

321
00:29:38,487 --> 00:29:40,530
He is indeed very dead.

322
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:29,621
Just a second.

323
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:40,632
- Go run the bath.
- Get out of here!

324
00:30:44,886 --> 00:30:46,096
No!

325
00:30:58,442 --> 00:31:00,569
- No, no!

326
00:31:02,487 --> 00:31:04,072
No-o-o-o-o-o!

327
00:31:30,515 --> 00:31:32,559
No-o-o-o!

328
00:31:32,642 --> 00:31:34,895
Stop!

329
00:31:34,978 --> 00:31:38,273
Sto-o-op! No!

330
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:24,277
You know, you're not under arrest.
You're just here for questioning.

331
00:32:24,361 --> 00:32:26,404
The sooner you talk to us...

332
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,990
...the sooner you get to go home.

333
00:32:34,704 --> 00:32:37,582
What happened to those people tonight?

334
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:44,506
Do you have any idea who they might be?

335
00:32:46,675 --> 00:32:48,718
Why did they attack you?

336
00:33:04,234 --> 00:33:06,361
Do you know who this is?

337
00:33:07,904 --> 00:33:10,031
Scully, Mulder.

338
00:33:11,408 --> 00:33:13,910
He'll keep an eye on her. Come on. Now.

339
00:33:19,207 --> 00:33:22,544
You've seriously compromised
our investigation.

340
00:33:22,627 --> 00:33:25,422
We followed leads pertaining to an X-File.

341
00:33:25,547 --> 00:33:28,592
I wanna know every detail
concerning this case.

342
00:33:28,717 --> 00:33:33,305
What case? <i>You</i> withheld information.
Why not tell us what you've got?

343
00:33:36,224 --> 00:33:38,852
Then we have nothing more to talk about.

344
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:40,353
Wait.

345
00:33:40,437 --> 00:33:44,816
HTG Industrial Technologies sold
restricted parts to the Isfahan.

346
00:33:44,941 --> 00:33:49,446
Serial numbers were recovered
in the July bombing of a navy transport van.

347
00:33:49,571 --> 00:33:52,032
- How was Lauren involved?
- We don't know.

348
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:54,159
You impeded our investigation.

349
00:33:54,284 --> 00:33:57,037
We don't have enough evidence to hold her.

350
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:02,125
If she doesn't talk, she goes free.
We lose our chance to break this.

351
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:04,294
I could make her talk.

352
00:34:05,462 --> 00:34:07,464
My advice to you...

353
00:34:07,589 --> 00:34:09,633
...don't get rough with her.

354
00:34:15,513 --> 00:34:17,641
That was a waste of time.

355
00:34:18,934 --> 00:34:20,602
Your turn.

356
00:34:30,987 --> 00:34:33,615
- Lauren...
- I won't talk to you either.

357
00:34:35,158 --> 00:34:37,661
OK... then you're free to go.

358
00:34:46,878 --> 00:34:48,922
I can't go back to that house.

359
00:34:49,005 --> 00:34:50,715
Why?

360
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,842
Because of Howard Graves?

361
00:34:52,968 --> 00:34:55,303
- He's dead.
- I know.

362
00:34:55,387 --> 00:34:57,889
He's watching over you, isn't he?

363
00:35:06,189 --> 00:35:09,651
I don't know if you've ever been
a secretary before.

364
00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:14,030
Sometimes your boss can talk
as if you weren't even in the room...

365
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:17,117
...which can hurt, you know.

366
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,495
But sometimes...
you're all he has to talk to...

367
00:35:20,578 --> 00:35:23,748
...which was how it always was
with me and Howard.

368
00:35:25,417 --> 00:35:28,003
One night, late, I went into his office.

369
00:35:28,086 --> 00:35:31,589
He was crying. More scared than sad.

370
00:35:31,715 --> 00:35:34,759
Pentagon contracts were being cancelled...

371
00:35:34,884 --> 00:35:36,886
...the company was going under.

372
00:35:37,012 --> 00:35:40,890
He felt personally responsible
for each of his employees.

373
00:35:41,016 --> 00:35:44,686
Seeing and feeling their fear every day...

374
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:46,896
...really wore him down.

375
00:35:49,524 --> 00:35:51,568
And this one time...

376
00:35:52,736 --> 00:35:57,741
...Dorlund came with that group,
that... um... Mid-East group.

377
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:00,076
Isfahan.

378
00:36:00,201 --> 00:36:02,203
That terrorist group.

379
00:36:02,287 --> 00:36:04,789
They buy parts at an outrageous price.

380
00:36:04,914 --> 00:36:08,710
Not just once, but for as long as
they could get away with it.

381
00:36:08,793 --> 00:36:10,837
That night Howard was crying.

382
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,549
He'd found out
Isfahan had claimed responsibility...

383
00:36:14,632 --> 00:36:17,719
...for killing a couple of sailors in Florida.

384
00:36:19,095 --> 00:36:21,139
He was never the same...

385
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:25,935
...and I thought...
that's why he killed himself.

386
00:36:27,103 --> 00:36:28,897
But he didn't.

387
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:30,648
I saw...

388
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:37,781
Howard showed me
how Dorlund had him killed.

389
00:36:37,906 --> 00:36:39,699
Made it look like a suicide.

390
00:36:39,783 --> 00:36:42,911
He could see Howard
was gonna put an end to the deal.

391
00:36:42,994 --> 00:36:45,330
So now Howard is protecting you?

392
00:36:45,455 --> 00:36:49,292
- It sounds so ridiculous.
- But you believe it.

393
00:36:50,627 --> 00:36:52,837
He was closer to me than my father.

394
00:36:52,962 --> 00:36:55,256
I told him that.

395
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,843
I still feel his presence.

396
00:36:58,968 --> 00:37:00,637
Sometimes...

397
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:03,765
...I even smell his aftershave.

398
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:07,852
If you just could've...

399
00:37:07,977 --> 00:37:09,562
...seen...

400
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:11,773
...the things I've seen.

401
00:37:14,442 --> 00:37:17,695
But I just... want all that to go away.

402
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:19,614
That's why I'm leaving.

403
00:37:19,697 --> 00:37:21,616
Maybe he can move on.

404
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:27,997
That's not enough.

405
00:37:28,123 --> 00:37:31,251
You have been given the chance
to tell him again.

406
00:37:31,334 --> 00:37:33,211
Take it.

407
00:37:34,129 --> 00:37:37,549
Tell him you love him...
by showing him, by...

408
00:37:38,508 --> 00:37:42,220
...by helping <i>us</i> finish
his unfinished business.

409
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:45,390
Lauren...

410
00:37:45,515 --> 00:37:48,852
...how will you ever be able to rest
if he never can?

411
00:37:51,479 --> 00:37:53,148
OK.

412
00:37:57,986 --> 00:37:59,779
I'm a mess.

413
00:37:59,863 --> 00:38:03,032
I'm gonna... um... freshen up.

414
00:38:13,168 --> 00:38:16,504
What are you doing, Scully?
You don't believe.

415
00:38:17,922 --> 00:38:21,801
Mulder, there's no such thing
as ghosts or psychokinesis.

416
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:25,930
I'm sure there's an explanation,
but I believe <i>she</i> believes.

417
00:38:26,055 --> 00:38:29,142
My priority is to get her
to help us stop Dorlund.

418
00:38:29,225 --> 00:38:33,938
We may have just sacrificed our best chance
to observe spectral phenomena.

419
00:38:34,063 --> 00:38:37,901
No, I'm giving us the chance
to solve a case that's tangible...

420
00:38:38,026 --> 00:38:40,528
...instead of chasing after shadows.

421
00:38:56,044 --> 00:38:58,087
- Get in line!
- Yes, sir.

422
00:39:01,299 --> 00:39:03,134
You ready?

423
00:39:03,259 --> 00:39:07,388
All right, everyone. We have
a warrant to search the premises...

424
00:39:07,472 --> 00:39:11,434
...for evidence pertaining
to the sale of restricted parts.

425
00:39:11,559 --> 00:39:15,563
Evidence may be in the form
of falsified export licences...

426
00:39:15,647 --> 00:39:18,107
...parts manifests, communiqués.

427
00:39:18,233 --> 00:39:20,860
If could be on computer disk or hard copy.

428
00:39:20,944 --> 00:39:23,613
If in doubt, ask. We need this to be clean.

429
00:39:23,738 --> 00:39:27,325
This is the culmination
of a year-long investigation.

430
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:31,913
If we don't come out with something
proving a link to the Isfahan...

431
00:39:31,996 --> 00:39:34,040
...this guy could walk.

432
00:39:34,123 --> 00:39:36,251
OK, let's go!

433
00:39:37,919 --> 00:39:39,712
You OK?

434
00:39:39,796 --> 00:39:42,882
It'll most likely be in Dorlund's office.

435
00:39:42,966 --> 00:39:45,009
We'll execute the search...

436
00:39:45,134 --> 00:39:49,305
...but we'll need you to guide us
so you'll have to be strong, OK?

437
00:40:04,612 --> 00:40:08,366
Everybody, stay calm.
Federal Bureau of Investigation.

438
00:40:08,491 --> 00:40:11,953
Ma'am, could you back away
from those files, please?

439
00:40:12,036 --> 00:40:14,163
Step aside, please.

440
00:40:42,358 --> 00:40:44,402
This is all we could find.

441
00:40:44,527 --> 00:40:47,864
We don't have him.
He's not even breaking a sweat.

442
00:40:50,158 --> 00:40:54,329
Our case is blown. We wasted a year.
This guy is gonna walk.

443
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:06,007
Let's get outta here.

444
00:41:09,344 --> 00:41:11,346
Lauren, it's over.

445
00:41:11,429 --> 00:41:13,348
We have to go.

446
00:41:13,431 --> 00:41:16,184
What we're looking for isn't here.

447
00:41:16,934 --> 00:41:19,312
Look, she's no agent.

448
00:41:19,395 --> 00:41:24,025
I don't want to be combative, but
she has no right to destroy my property!

449
00:41:24,108 --> 00:41:28,821
Destroying property? What about that van
that blew up killing those men?!

450
00:41:28,905 --> 00:41:31,366
What are you talking about,
you stupid bitch?

451
00:41:31,449 --> 00:41:32,909
Lauren, no!

452
00:41:41,042 --> 00:41:43,544
Don't kill him!

453
00:41:43,628 --> 00:41:45,213
Help us find it!

454
00:41:50,885 --> 00:41:52,303
Get down!

455
00:41:57,934 --> 00:41:59,519
Mulder!

456
00:41:59,602 --> 00:42:01,938
Mulder!

457
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,928
Oh, my God!

458
00:42:47,775 --> 00:42:50,945
I guess
what we're looking for <i>is</i> here.

459
00:42:57,535 --> 00:43:01,414
The US Attorney is going after Dorlund
with all he's got...

460
00:43:01,497 --> 00:43:04,167
...including the murder of Howard Graves.

461
00:43:04,292 --> 00:43:06,294
I'll come back to testify.

462
00:43:06,377 --> 00:43:08,296
Where are you going?

463
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:11,007
Away from here.

464
00:43:18,514 --> 00:43:19,974
Thanks.

465
00:43:26,230 --> 00:43:28,649
Boy, she's in a rush to get outta here.

466
00:43:28,733 --> 00:43:32,695
Out of here or away from
the ghost of Howard Graves?

467
00:43:35,031 --> 00:43:37,909
Hey, Scully, do you believe in an afterlife?

468
00:43:38,034 --> 00:43:40,161
I'd settle for a life in this one.

469
00:43:41,370 --> 00:43:43,706
Have you ever seen the Liberty Bell?

470
00:43:43,831 --> 00:43:45,500
Yes.

471
00:43:46,751 --> 00:43:49,921
I've been to Philly a hundred times
and never seen it.

472
00:43:50,046 --> 00:43:55,218
You're not missing much. It's a big bell with
a crack and you have to wait in a long line.

473
00:43:56,552 --> 00:43:58,888
Yeah, but I'd really like to go.

474
00:43:59,889 --> 00:44:01,724
Why now?

475
00:44:01,849 --> 00:44:05,561
I don't know. How late
do you think they stay open?

476
00:44:18,115 --> 00:44:20,993
Miss Kyte, I asked for this 25 minutes ago.

477
00:44:21,077 --> 00:44:22,703
I know. I'm sorry.

478
00:44:22,787 --> 00:44:27,583
Maybe that's the way they work back East.
<i>Here</i> punctuality is a virtue.

479
00:44:34,048 --> 00:44:38,052
We <i>have</i> to find new office space -
every time a truck goes by...

480
00:44:38,135 --> 00:44:40,263
...the whole building shakes!

481
00:44:43,057 --> 00:44:44,809
That's all, Lauren.

482
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:09,166
Pam Atkinson

483
00:45:37,862 --> 00:45:39,989
<i>I made this!</i>
