1
00:00:08,135 --> 00:00:11,054
As soon as we're in position
we'll be on a count of five.

2
00:00:16,143 --> 00:00:19,730
- Excuse me, that's my house.
- OK, let her through.

3
00:00:19,813 --> 00:00:21,899
- What's going on?
- Mrs Budahas?

4
00:00:21,982 --> 00:00:26,570
Your husband's violated security procedure
and stolen an armed military vehicle.

5
00:00:26,653 --> 00:00:28,197
<i>Team One moving in.</i>

6
00:00:47,883 --> 00:00:49,885
You've got to let me talk to him.

7
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,442
What the hell...?

8
00:01:05,525 --> 00:01:08,946
<i>We got him.</i>
<i>But he's gonna need a doctor.</i>

9
00:01:09,029 --> 00:01:11,198
Or something.

10
00:02:33,488 --> 00:02:35,032
Hi. I got your message.

11
00:02:35,115 --> 00:02:37,868
Sorry for the run-around.
Can I buy you a drink?

12
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:40,662
It's two in the afternoon,
Agent Mulder.

13
00:02:40,746 --> 00:02:43,582
That's not stopping
the rest of these people.

14
00:02:43,665 --> 00:02:47,836
- I got something to show you.
- Something you couldn't show me at work?

15
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:50,005
Let's get a table.

16
00:03:00,015 --> 00:03:02,976
That's Colonel Robert Budahas.

17
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:08,106
He was a test pilot for the military,
stationed at Ellens Air Base, Idaho.

18
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,611
Four months ago, Colonel Budahas
experienced a psychotic episode...

19
00:03:12,694 --> 00:03:16,740
...and barricaded himself in his home.
Military police were called in.

20
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:20,994
Budahas was removed and hospitalised
for the treatment of his condition.

21
00:03:21,078 --> 00:03:22,788
Which was what, exactly?

22
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:26,583
The military will not comment
on the cause, nature or status.

23
00:03:26,666 --> 00:03:30,670
In fact, the military will not comment
on Colonel Budahas at all.

24
00:03:30,754 --> 00:03:31,922
What do you mean?

25
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:37,344
Mrs Budahas has neither seen nor heard
from her husband in over four months.

26
00:03:37,427 --> 00:03:42,474
Last month, she contacted the FBI
and reported it as a kidnapping.

27
00:03:42,557 --> 00:03:46,353
Why would the military
kidnap one of their own pilots?

28
00:03:46,436 --> 00:03:49,981
That's the $64,000 question, Scully.

29
00:03:50,065 --> 00:03:55,195
Since 1963, six pilots have been listed
missing in action from Ellens Air Base.

30
00:03:55,278 --> 00:04:00,617
The military say these pilots accepted
the risks of flying experimental aircraft.

31
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:04,287
It's rumoured they were shot down
at high altitudes...

32
00:04:04,371 --> 00:04:07,457
...while they were penetrating
Russian air space.

33
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:09,209
There were other rumours.

34
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:14,798
I've been tracking this case since
it came through the Boise office.

35
00:04:14,881 --> 00:04:17,801
Last week it was de-prioritised.

36
00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:21,430
They shelved it without an investigation.

37
00:04:21,513 --> 00:04:23,265
So...

38
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:27,310
So we're going to the <i>spud state</i>
to investigate a kidnapping.

39
00:04:27,394 --> 00:04:32,566
I don't get it, Mulder. Does this
have something to do with an X-File?

40
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:36,528
I thought you only liked
those paranormal-type cases.

41
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:38,822
Am I missing something here?

42
00:04:38,905 --> 00:04:42,868
Let's just say
this case has a distinct smell to it.

43
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:44,995
A certain...

44
00:04:45,078 --> 00:04:47,497
...paranormal bouquet.

45
00:04:47,581 --> 00:04:49,666
Excuse me.

46
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,814
Leave this case alone, Agent Mulder.

47
00:05:13,773 --> 00:05:14,816
What?

48
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:18,320
The military will not tolerate
an FBI investigation.

49
00:05:19,863 --> 00:05:21,114
Who are you?

50
00:05:21,198 --> 00:05:25,827
I... uh... can be of help to you.
I've had a certain interest in your work.

51
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:29,498
Sorry.

52
00:05:29,581 --> 00:05:31,166
How do you know about my work?

53
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:36,713
Well, let's just say that I'm in a position
to know quite a lot of things.

54
00:05:36,796 --> 00:05:38,715
Things about our government.

55
00:05:38,798 --> 00:05:40,884
Who are you? Who do you work for?

56
00:05:40,967 --> 00:05:45,764
It's unimportant. I came here
to give you some valuable advice.

57
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:50,435
You are exposing yourself
and Agent Scully to unnecessary risk.

58
00:05:50,519 --> 00:05:55,732
- I advise you to drop the case.
- I can't do that.

59
00:05:55,815 --> 00:05:59,069
You have much work to do, Agent Mulder.

60
00:05:59,152 --> 00:06:03,490
Don't jeopardise the future
of your own efforts.

61
00:06:24,177 --> 00:06:25,637
You OK, Mulder?

62
00:06:27,264 --> 00:06:30,392
Yeah, I'm fine.

63
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:02,173
Hello.

64
00:07:02,257 --> 00:07:05,969
<i>Mulder.</i>
<i>I checked on that file you gave me.</i>

65
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:08,930
<i>- You failed to tell me a few things.</i>

66
00:07:09,014 --> 00:07:12,809
<i>This isn't some UFO goose chase</i>
<i>you're leading me on, is it?</i>

67
00:07:13,602 --> 00:07:15,687
<i>- Are you there, Mulder?</i>
- Yeah.

68
00:07:16,813 --> 00:07:19,816
<i>The Bureau has it out for us already.</i>

69
00:07:19,899 --> 00:07:24,738
<i>It would make us appear stupid if</i>
<i>my field report read like a tabloid story.</i>

70
00:07:26,364 --> 00:07:28,908
I don't wanna talk about it on this line.

71
00:07:28,992 --> 00:07:32,162
I'll talk to you about it on the flight out, OK?

72
00:07:52,515 --> 00:07:53,558
Hello?

73
00:07:53,975 --> 00:07:56,061
- Mrs Budahas?
- Yes.

74
00:07:56,186 --> 00:07:58,063
We're from the FBI.

75
00:07:58,146 --> 00:08:00,565
Oh, yes. Please, come in.

76
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:07,113
I started noticing it about two years ago.

77
00:08:07,197 --> 00:08:09,991
Bob developed this rash under his arms.

78
00:08:10,075 --> 00:08:12,285
We'd been doing some renovations

79
00:08:12,369 --> 00:08:15,705
so we thought it was a reaction
to the paint stripper.

80
00:08:15,955 --> 00:08:18,375
But then everything just went crazy.

81
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:20,418
How do you mean?

82
00:08:20,502 --> 00:08:23,922
Bob's whole personality...
It was so unpredictable.

83
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:26,091
He started... doing things.

84
00:08:27,092 --> 00:08:30,595
- What kinds of things?
- It was embarrassing at first.

85
00:08:30,679 --> 00:08:33,807
We were having this dinner party once
and, um...

86
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:36,518
...he sprinkled Tetra Meal D over his food.

87
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:40,438
That's fish food flakes.

88
00:08:43,066 --> 00:08:47,862
- Have you talked to him about this?
- I tried. It was extremely difficult.

89
00:08:47,946 --> 00:08:50,031
Bob would get so angry.

90
00:08:50,115 --> 00:08:52,367
He'd yell at the kids for no reason

91
00:08:52,450 --> 00:08:56,371
and then he would shake
like he was having a seizure.

92
00:08:56,871 --> 00:09:00,583
- Did he ever talk about his work?
- It was never discussed.

93
00:09:00,667 --> 00:09:02,669
Even before the problems.

94
00:09:02,752 --> 00:09:06,589
I knew he worked on top-secret projects.
Word gets around.

95
00:09:06,673 --> 00:09:09,467
Bob was always a patriot first.

96
00:09:09,551 --> 00:09:13,888
He took loyalty to his country as an oath...

97
00:09:13,972 --> 00:09:17,392
...and now they treat us like strangers.

98
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:23,106
I just want my husband back.

99
00:09:23,189 --> 00:09:26,276
The government is not above the law.

100
00:09:26,359 --> 00:09:29,154
They cannot withhold information.

101
00:09:29,237 --> 00:09:31,865
And then I think, what if he's...

102
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,411
How would I support the family?

103
00:09:36,494 --> 00:09:39,456
You said "word gets around".

104
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:43,209
Have you ever heard of this
happening to anyone else?

105
00:09:46,838 --> 00:09:50,717
Yeah, Verla McLennen's husband.
He went kinda crazy.

106
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,804
But it's not like he didn't get to come home.

107
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:07,776
- How long has he been...
- Almost two years.

108
00:10:09,068 --> 00:10:14,324
The fly-fishing idea was his brother Hank's.
I was upset at first.

109
00:10:14,407 --> 00:10:17,452
But when you're the wife of a test pilot,

110
00:10:17,535 --> 00:10:20,288
you thank God
just to have them home alive.

111
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:25,668
Mrs McLennen, has anyone ever offered
to explain what caused this?

112
00:10:25,752 --> 00:10:27,837
Stress, I guess.

113
00:10:28,463 --> 00:10:33,092
You have to understand. The military
deals with things in a certain way.

114
00:10:33,176 --> 00:10:38,723
They've given him plenty of therapy
and treatment and I'm thankful for that.

115
00:10:38,807 --> 00:10:43,561
They've taken good care of us.
And they do volunteer for their jobs.

116
00:10:45,939 --> 00:10:49,609
Really, Anita,
bringing the FBI to my house.

117
00:10:56,825 --> 00:11:00,411
I've called all the numbers
a thousand times.

118
00:11:00,495 --> 00:11:02,038
Let me know what you find out.

119
00:11:02,121 --> 00:11:07,210
We'll be staying at the Beach Grove Motel
if you need anything, OK?

120
00:11:09,462 --> 00:11:12,048
What did you make of Uncle Fester?

121
00:11:12,131 --> 00:11:16,845
It's called stereotypy.
It's a syndrome produced by extreme stress.

122
00:11:16,928 --> 00:11:20,974
POWs have suffered from it.
They've studied it in zoo animals.

123
00:11:21,057 --> 00:11:23,393
Yeah, but these guys are test pilots.

124
00:11:23,476 --> 00:11:26,396
They're not supposed to fold
under pressure.

125
00:11:26,479 --> 00:11:29,274
Ever hear of the Aurora Project?

126
00:11:29,357 --> 00:11:34,863
That's the unacknowledged code name for
a Defense Department surveillance project.

127
00:11:34,946 --> 00:11:36,906
The Pentagon has admitted
they've been testing

128
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:40,702
a secret class of sub-orbital spy craft.

129
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:45,498
Maybe these guys are flying those planes.
Maybe they're washouts.

130
00:11:45,582 --> 00:11:50,753
You saw the photos in there. Budahas
received a presidential commendation.

131
00:11:50,837 --> 00:11:53,923
He's never washed out
of anything in his life.

132
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:03,141
I've been on hold with the base
for 45 minutes. How about you?

133
00:12:03,224 --> 00:12:08,730
Yeah, somebody named Colonel Kissel
will meet with us... a week from Friday.

134
00:12:08,813 --> 00:12:10,899
Yeah, right!

135
00:12:14,611 --> 00:12:16,237
Did you say Kissel?

136
00:12:32,128 --> 00:12:34,255
- Colonel Kissel?
- Yes.

137
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:37,383
Can I talk with you?
Special Agent Mulder, FBI.

138
00:12:37,467 --> 00:12:41,220
I've got nothing to say.
This is an invasion of my privacy!

139
00:12:41,304 --> 00:12:45,767
- Talk to us about Colonel Budahas.
- Get the hell out of my yard!

140
00:12:51,606 --> 00:12:54,776
- Good thing we kept that appointment.
<i>- </i> Hi!

141
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:57,070
Are you the FBI agents?

142
00:12:57,153 --> 00:13:02,367
Paul Mosinger. I work for the local paper.
We live near Verla McLennen.

143
00:13:02,450 --> 00:13:05,328
She said you're investigating Budahas.

144
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:07,497
We're just looking around.

145
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:12,794
I got you. A lot of people out here
are just looking around. UFO nuts, mostly.

146
00:13:12,877 --> 00:13:17,006
- But it's not every day we get FBI.

147
00:13:19,384 --> 00:13:22,428
By the time you hear them
they're already gone.

148
00:13:22,512 --> 00:13:24,973
So, about Budahas. Getting anywhere?

149
00:13:25,056 --> 00:13:27,308
We're not at liberty to comment.

150
00:13:27,392 --> 00:13:29,560
Well...

151
00:13:29,644 --> 00:13:32,230
Paul, right?

152
00:13:32,313 --> 00:13:35,608
You've lived in this area a while.
You ever seen a UFO?

153
00:13:35,692 --> 00:13:41,155
Never. Bunch of hooey, if you ask me.
People see what they wanna see.

154
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:44,659
But if I wanted to talk
to one of those UFO nuts...

155
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:46,869
...where would I go?

156
00:14:03,511 --> 00:14:05,888
F-15 Eagle, pulling about four Gs.

157
00:14:05,972 --> 00:14:09,058
Those boys think they are such hotshots.

158
00:14:09,142 --> 00:14:14,063
Get a few drinks in 'em, you'd think
it was them up there flapping their wings.

159
00:14:14,147 --> 00:14:18,484
- Who's the photographer?
- Various and sundry.

160
00:14:19,861 --> 00:14:23,823
- I took the one on the end there.
- You're kidding? Where?

161
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:26,784
Out on the back porch.

162
00:14:26,868 --> 00:14:31,247
Taking out the garbage,
and there it was, just hovering.

163
00:14:32,749 --> 00:14:35,334
Quiet, like a hummingbird.

164
00:14:35,418 --> 00:14:37,045
I thought it was gonna land
in the parking lot

165
00:14:37,128 --> 00:14:40,465
and I was gonna have to serve 'em lunch.

166
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:43,593
I'm selling limited-edition prints. 20 dollars.

167
00:14:43,676 --> 00:14:46,387
Down to my last five if you're interested.

168
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,848
Put it on my tab.

169
00:14:49,724 --> 00:14:51,476
Sucker.

170
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:55,438
What would be the chances
of someone like me seeing a UFO?

171
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:56,939
Catch you outside.

172
00:15:03,613 --> 00:15:08,159
Do you wanna see something weird?
Ellens Air Base isn't even on my map.

173
00:15:08,242 --> 00:15:09,911
I know. Let's go.

174
00:15:09,994 --> 00:15:11,788
You know?

175
00:15:11,871 --> 00:15:16,000
- Where are we going?
- We got our own map. Sucker!

176
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:52,036
What do you honestly hope to see?

177
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:54,205
I don't know. Maybe nothing.

178
00:15:56,749 --> 00:16:01,379
Is this why we came out here, Mulder?
To look for UFOs?

179
00:16:03,506 --> 00:16:07,718
Yeah, this is gonna look real good
on my field report!

180
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:39,167
Scully, wake up!

181
00:16:39,292 --> 00:16:41,377
You gotta see this!

182
00:16:54,098 --> 00:16:55,558
What are they?

183
00:16:55,641 --> 00:16:59,562
I don't know. Just keep watching.
It's unbelievable.

184
00:17:00,855 --> 00:17:05,067
That's unreal.
I've never seen anything like it.

185
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:07,820
They've been doing that for half an hour.

186
00:17:08,863 --> 00:17:11,908
Aircraft can't manoeuvre like that.

187
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:13,576
What else could they be?

188
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:15,203
I don't know.

189
00:17:15,286 --> 00:17:18,539
Lasers being shot from the ground,
reflecting up off the clouds.

190
00:17:29,675 --> 00:17:31,761
Oh, my God!

191
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:34,388
Here comes another one.

192
00:17:41,646 --> 00:17:44,899
That's not a plane.
That's a helicopter.

193
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:53,824
- Hey!
- Let's get outta here!

194
00:18:12,218 --> 00:18:14,595
- Don't shoot!
- Stay right there.

195
00:18:14,679 --> 00:18:16,764
We didn't do anything.

196
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:26,524
Come on!

197
00:18:40,746 --> 00:18:43,749
That was extreme.

198
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:47,003
- Let's go. You're coming with us.
<i>- </i> What?

199
00:18:52,758 --> 00:18:55,594
So what <i>exactly</i>
were you guys doing in there?

200
00:18:56,846 --> 00:18:58,931
Well, we were... um...

201
00:19:04,603 --> 00:19:08,607
- We kinda have this spot.
- You know, we kinda kick back...

202
00:19:08,691 --> 00:19:11,569
...listen to some tunes
and watch the air show.

203
00:19:11,652 --> 00:19:14,989
- Were you ever chased out before?
- No, first time.

204
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:17,366
Our friend showed us a hole in the fence.

205
00:19:17,450 --> 00:19:20,328
One time they dropped these bombs. Whoa!

206
00:19:20,411 --> 00:19:22,121
Yeah, it was kinda heavy.

207
00:19:23,164 --> 00:19:28,419
There's a place called the Yellow Base,
where they store all this stuff.

208
00:19:28,502 --> 00:19:33,049
And my friend said
that there's land mines all around it.

209
00:19:39,138 --> 00:19:41,098
I've got a 20. Over.

210
00:19:41,182 --> 00:19:45,728
<i>Roger, Red Bird. Assume fallback</i>
<i>position. We're opening the cage.</i>

211
00:19:45,811 --> 00:19:47,355
Red Bird out.

212
00:19:47,438 --> 00:19:51,025
Sometimes they come in real low
and just put on the skitters.

213
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:54,236
It's like
and then they just hang there

214
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:56,364
and hover without making a sound.

215
00:19:56,447 --> 00:20:01,077
And you just think, you know,
who turned down the volume, right?

216
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:02,870
What do you think they are?

217
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:05,539
OK. Everybody thinks that they're UFOs.

218
00:20:05,623 --> 00:20:11,253
But I think it's some kind of Star Wars,
cybertech, newfangled hardware, right?

219
00:20:11,337 --> 00:20:15,758
They're probably rolling out
for Desert Storm Il or something like that.

220
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:19,136
Cruise right over Saddam's house,
it'd be like...

221
00:20:23,808 --> 00:20:25,726
Do they look anything like this?

222
00:20:27,186 --> 00:20:28,229
No.

223
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:31,399
They look <i>exactly</i> like that.

224
00:20:33,317 --> 00:20:35,611
- Thanks.
- Later, dude.

225
00:20:47,415 --> 00:20:49,875
- What's that?
- Evidence.

226
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:57,425
Kids today, huh?

227
00:20:57,508 --> 00:21:00,219
You believe it all, don't you?

228
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:02,555
Why wouldn't I?

229
00:21:05,433 --> 00:21:08,269
Did you see their eyes?
If I were that stoned...

230
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:11,105
Ooh, if you were that stoned what?

231
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:14,316
You could've shown him
a picture of a flying hamburger...

232
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,819
...and he would have said
that's what he saw.

233
00:21:16,902 --> 00:21:18,779
I wanna show you something.

234
00:21:21,031 --> 00:21:27,121
This is a photo of a UFO that reportedly
crashed in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947.

235
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:31,125
Now I know you don't believe that story,
but hear me out.

236
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:34,378
Ellens Air Base,
the same base we're at right now...

237
00:21:34,462 --> 00:21:38,632
...the same base that doesn't appear
on your US government map...

238
00:21:38,716 --> 00:21:42,678
...is supposedly where parts
from the wreckage were shipped.

239
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:48,100
Mulder, are you suggesting
that the military is flying UFOs?

240
00:21:48,184 --> 00:21:52,271
No, planes <i>built</i> using UFO technology.

241
00:22:00,279 --> 00:22:04,074
Mulder, come on.
You've got two blurry photos.

242
00:22:04,158 --> 00:22:07,244
One of them taken almost 50 years ago.

243
00:22:07,328 --> 00:22:11,165
And another one
you purchased today in a roadside diner.

244
00:22:11,248 --> 00:22:15,628
- You're going out on a pretty big limb.
- Tell me there isn't a resemblance.

245
00:22:15,711 --> 00:22:19,757
Tell me one good reason
why either of these photos is authentic.

246
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,427
You saw exactly what I saw in the sky
tonight. What do you think they were?

247
00:22:23,511 --> 00:22:29,767
Just because I can't explain it, doesn't mean
I'm going to believe they were UFOs.

248
00:22:30,351 --> 00:22:35,940
Unidentified Flying Objects.
I think that fits the description pretty well.

249
00:22:36,023 --> 00:22:39,443
- Tell me I'm crazy.
- Mulder, you're crazy.

250
00:22:41,487 --> 00:22:46,033
And it still doesn't explain to me
what happened to Colonel Budahas.

251
00:22:48,369 --> 00:22:50,287
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

252
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:03,217
You didn't come to raid my minibar,
did you?

253
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,636
- You ready for this?
- What?

254
00:23:05,719 --> 00:23:10,099
We got a message from Mrs Budahas.
Her husband came home last night.

255
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:26,574
We got your message.

256
00:23:26,657 --> 00:23:29,702
Mrs Budahas, are you OK?

257
00:23:32,663 --> 00:23:34,748
Come inside.

258
00:23:37,293 --> 00:23:39,128
What is it?

259
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:41,297
What? What's wrong?

260
00:23:42,965 --> 00:23:45,342
That... is not my husband.

261
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:54,518
Honey, who are these people?

262
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:10,367
That is not him. That is not my husband.
They've done something to him.

263
00:24:10,451 --> 00:24:13,370
- What are you talking about?
- It's OK. Just relax.

264
00:24:13,454 --> 00:24:15,956
I'm Special Agent Mulder from the FBI.

265
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:19,835
We're investigating your disappearance.

266
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:23,756
Can you explain your whereabouts
over the past four months?

267
00:24:26,050 --> 00:24:28,385
- I was in the hospital.
- Here? On base?

268
00:24:29,303 --> 00:24:30,387
I think so.

269
00:24:30,471 --> 00:24:33,015
Colonel Budahas, may I ask your birth date?

270
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:36,393
November 21st, 1948.

271
00:24:39,396 --> 00:24:41,065
And the names of your kids?

272
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:43,359
Josh and Leslie. They're right there.

273
00:24:46,236 --> 00:24:47,905
Yeah.

274
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:51,450
Green Bay fan.

275
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:53,077
Yes, sir.

276
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,497
Bet you remember the Super Bowl of '68,
huh? Don Chandler...

277
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:00,376
Kicked four field goals.
Lombardi's last game.

278
00:25:01,126 --> 00:25:04,588
- Why do I have to answer these questions?
- It's not him.

279
00:25:10,094 --> 00:25:13,430
Colonel Budahas,
you're a pilot, isn't that right?

280
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:15,057
Yes, sir.

281
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:18,811
Bet you've flown just about everything
with two wings.

282
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:24,191
I got this hotshot pilot friend who said he
could do an Immelmann at a sustained 8 Gs.

283
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:26,485
Is that possible?

284
00:25:36,328 --> 00:25:38,455
I-I don't...

285
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:42,126
I can't...

286
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:47,256
Anita?

287
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,676
I can't remember!

288
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:54,054
No!

289
00:26:00,394 --> 00:26:03,522
Mulder, would you explain to me
what's going on?

290
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:07,818
I think they rewired that man's brain.
Some kind of selective memory drain.

291
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:11,572
The brain doesn't work like that.
You can't just erase certain files.

292
00:26:11,655 --> 00:26:12,948
Then you explain it to me.

293
00:26:13,031 --> 00:26:16,368
- There are types of amnesia...
- This is not amnesia!

294
00:26:16,452 --> 00:26:18,620
It's something far more deliberate
and insidious.

295
00:26:18,704 --> 00:26:21,749
The science or medical technology

296
00:26:21,832 --> 00:26:24,126
to do what you are suggesting
does not exist.

297
00:26:24,209 --> 00:26:28,255
Neither does the technology
to fly the aircraft we saw last night.

298
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:32,009
They can do this. He should've known
the answer to the question.

299
00:26:32,092 --> 00:26:34,595
It just wasn't in his head any more.

300
00:26:37,473 --> 00:26:40,184
Even if they could,
why would they do it?

301
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:42,352
To control information.

302
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:47,065
Maybe after his psychotic episode
Budahas became a security risk.

303
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:51,236
It couldn't just be that he had a breakdown
with a concomitant memory lapse?

304
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,281
No, I think men like Budahas are incapable...

305
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:56,492
...of dealing with the stress
of flying the aircraft we saw.

306
00:26:56,575 --> 00:26:59,286
Of doing those manoeuvres.

307
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:02,372
We're talking about a technology
so advanced...

308
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:06,376
...that it's taken almost 50 years
to make it work. UFO technology, Scully.

309
00:27:18,722 --> 00:27:20,182
- What the hell...
- Hold on!

310
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:33,779
Please, step out of the car.

311
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:38,033
Do you think if we ignore him he'll go away?

312
00:27:38,116 --> 00:27:40,202
Please, step out of the car.

313
00:27:40,911 --> 00:27:42,204
Guess not.

314
00:27:47,501 --> 00:27:49,795
Special Agent Mulder, FBI.

315
00:27:49,878 --> 00:27:51,797
Federal agents.

316
00:28:11,191 --> 00:28:14,403
Wanna tell me what this is about?

317
00:28:16,572 --> 00:28:18,115
National security.

318
00:28:18,198 --> 00:28:21,910
Now get in your car.
You'll be escorted back to your motel.

319
00:28:21,994 --> 00:28:24,246
You'll leave town immediately...

320
00:28:24,329 --> 00:28:28,834
...or assume the consequences
of intense indiscretion.

321
00:28:32,838 --> 00:28:37,759
Nothing under Idaho plate CC1356?
No plate registered under that number?

322
00:28:39,428 --> 00:28:42,014
Thanks, Gail.

323
00:28:42,097 --> 00:28:45,142
No, no, no.
I'm sure the other one's bogus, too.

324
00:28:45,559 --> 00:28:47,019
Bye.

325
00:28:50,731 --> 00:28:52,524
So, who were those guys?

326
00:28:52,608 --> 00:28:57,404
I don't think it was those kids they were
chasing away from the base last night.

327
00:28:57,487 --> 00:28:59,740
I think it was us.

328
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:03,535
They knew we were coming
before we ever arrived.

329
00:29:03,619 --> 00:29:06,580
And they returned Colonel Budahas
as a decoy.

330
00:29:12,753 --> 00:29:16,298
- There's something I didn't tell you.
- Something else?

331
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:20,886
I was approached by a man in DC who
warned me to stay away from this case.

332
00:29:20,969 --> 00:29:22,721
He didn't give me his name...

333
00:29:22,804 --> 00:29:25,891
- ..and my phone was being tapped.
- What?!

334
00:29:25,974 --> 00:29:29,978
Why would they go to all this trouble?
Out of a need for security?

335
00:29:30,062 --> 00:29:32,689
Security of what?

336
00:29:38,236 --> 00:29:41,573
I think there's
a huge conspiracy here, Scully.

337
00:29:41,657 --> 00:29:45,661
I'm sure they've got a UFO here.
They'll do anything to keep it secret.

338
00:29:45,744 --> 00:29:49,998
Including sacrificing the minds of those
pilots. Because what if the secret got out?

339
00:29:50,082 --> 00:29:54,294
If... <i>if</i> that were true...

340
00:29:54,378 --> 00:29:56,463
...it would be a national scandal.

341
00:29:56,546 --> 00:29:58,548
No, you're not thinking big enough.

342
00:29:58,632 --> 00:30:03,470
If it were true, it would be confirmation
of the existence of extraterrestrial life.

343
00:30:05,013 --> 00:30:10,769
Did you ever stop to think that what we saw
was simply an experimental plane...

344
00:30:10,852 --> 00:30:14,564
...like the Stealth bomber
or this Aurora Project?

345
00:30:14,648 --> 00:30:19,611
Doesn't the government have a right
and a responsibility to protect its secrets?

346
00:30:19,695 --> 00:30:21,780
Yes, but at what cost?

347
00:30:21,863 --> 00:30:27,160
When does the human cost become too high
for the building of a better machine?

348
00:30:27,244 --> 00:30:30,372
These are questions
we have no business asking.

349
00:30:31,331 --> 00:30:35,043
Our kidnap victim is no longer outstanding.

350
00:30:35,127 --> 00:30:38,755
Let's get out of here, Mulder,
while <i>you</i> still have a job.

351
00:30:43,051 --> 00:30:44,761
Aren't you even curious?

352
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:02,070
I'm gonna shower.
I'll pack and then we'll get out of here.

353
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:24,509
Mulder! Where are you going?

354
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:38,440
Right here.

355
00:31:41,443 --> 00:31:43,403
Hey, aren't you guys coming?

356
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:46,782
No, we've only gone in at night.

357
00:31:47,699 --> 00:31:51,828
This spot where you watched the air show?
How far is it?

358
00:31:52,621 --> 00:31:54,081
45 minutes?

359
00:31:54,164 --> 00:31:57,292
- Will I be able to find it?
<i>- </i> Just stay on the path.

360
00:31:57,417 --> 00:31:59,836
What about Yellow Base
where they hangar them?

361
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:03,298
Don't! Don't even. It's like... ten miles.

362
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:06,426
Nobody's ever...
nobody's ever been that far!

363
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:09,638
Hey, don't go past
the edge of the tall weeds.

364
00:32:12,349 --> 00:32:14,434
Oh, man!

365
00:32:14,518 --> 00:32:17,687
Did we tell him
about the land mines and junk?

366
00:32:18,647 --> 00:32:19,815
Hey!

367
00:34:14,638 --> 00:34:16,723
Go! Go!

368
00:34:28,193 --> 00:34:29,236
No!

369
00:34:29,319 --> 00:34:31,529
C'mon! Hold him!

370
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:34,241
Oxygen!

371
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:36,743
I'm trying to call Washington, DC...

372
00:34:36,826 --> 00:34:39,788
...and I can't seem to get
a long-distance line.

373
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:42,415
Hello? Hello?

374
00:34:48,838 --> 00:34:53,468
Excuse me, my phone's not working. Can I
use yours to make a credit card call, please?

375
00:34:53,551 --> 00:34:55,637
Sure thing.

376
00:35:03,561 --> 00:35:05,230
This one's not working either.

377
00:35:05,313 --> 00:35:10,277
Phones are undependable around here.
People say it's the military interference.

378
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,488
But they say that about everything.

379
00:35:13,571 --> 00:35:15,198
Thanks.

380
00:36:05,874 --> 00:36:09,461
Hi. I was just looking for you.

381
00:36:09,544 --> 00:36:13,089
I knocked but I saw the door was open.

382
00:36:14,007 --> 00:36:17,969
- I was in the lobby trying to make a call.
- Phones down again?

383
00:36:19,262 --> 00:36:22,474
<i>Base to Red Bird.</i>
<i>Your position? Over.</i>

384
00:36:27,937 --> 00:36:30,023
<i>Red Bird, do you copy?</i>

385
00:36:31,441 --> 00:36:32,734
What are you doing?

386
00:36:35,695 --> 00:36:39,532
Excuse me. There's nothing in there.

387
00:36:56,091 --> 00:36:59,427
Get in the car! Hands on the car! Do it!

388
00:36:59,511 --> 00:37:03,473
- Put the gun down and we'll talk about it.
- I said hands against the car!

389
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:05,934
Who are you?

390
00:37:06,017 --> 00:37:09,896
You're a long way from home.
Nobody wants this to come to violence.

391
00:37:09,979 --> 00:37:13,608
- Where's Mulder?
- We took him to the base.

392
00:37:13,691 --> 00:37:15,485
We waited for him.

393
00:37:15,568 --> 00:37:19,114
Get on that walkie-talkie
and find out where Mulder is.

394
00:37:19,197 --> 00:37:20,573
I can't do that.

395
00:37:20,657 --> 00:37:24,369
You can. Or I'll have
every newspaper in America out here...

396
00:37:24,452 --> 00:37:27,288
...writing about your experimental aircraft!

397
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:31,167
Vitals?

398
00:37:34,504 --> 00:37:36,589
Respiration...

399
00:38:00,363 --> 00:38:02,991
There are other ways to go about this.

400
00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:07,203
Yeah, I've already seen
where you get with tears and a sad story.

401
00:38:26,181 --> 00:38:28,975
<i>- Your package is arriving.</i>
- Roger.

402
00:38:32,896 --> 00:38:35,982
- What are we doing?
- Waiting.

403
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:39,027
I want the car running.

404
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:42,071
I said start the car!

405
00:38:44,574 --> 00:38:47,911
And put your hands on the wheel
where I can see them.

406
00:38:50,622 --> 00:38:54,584
You do anything stupid
and this situation could get big in a hurry.

407
00:38:54,667 --> 00:38:56,961
Just keep telling yourself that.

408
00:38:57,045 --> 00:38:59,547
<i>- Intruder arriving.</i>
<i>- Copy.</i>

409
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:38,378
I want you to keep the car running
and step out of the car.

410
00:39:55,478 --> 00:39:57,355
Get in the car, Mulder.

411
00:39:59,857 --> 00:40:01,359
Get in the car!

412
00:40:11,869 --> 00:40:13,663
I just wanna say

413
00:40:13,746 --> 00:40:17,166
everything you've seen here
is equal to the protection we give it.

414
00:40:18,376 --> 00:40:21,087
It's <i>you</i> who have acted inappropriately.

415
00:40:55,705 --> 00:40:57,332
You OK, Mulder?

416
00:40:58,958 --> 00:41:01,044
I think so.

417
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,469
Scully, I...

418
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:13,514
What?

419
00:41:16,392 --> 00:41:18,478
How did I get here?

420
00:41:24,734 --> 00:41:26,861
<i>- </i> Hi.
- Hello.

421
00:41:26,944 --> 00:41:29,906
We came by to see
how your husband was doing.

422
00:41:29,989 --> 00:41:33,660
Oh, he's fine.
He's getting much better now.

423
00:41:34,827 --> 00:41:37,413
- Could we see him?
- Um...

424
00:41:37,497 --> 00:41:42,585
- Well, he's resting now.
<i>- </i> Who is it now?

425
00:41:43,544 --> 00:41:46,047
Thank you for your concern.

426
00:41:50,468 --> 00:41:52,970
They got to her, Scully.
They were here.

427
00:41:53,054 --> 00:41:57,308
- They must have threatened her and...
- That's enough, Mulder!

428
00:41:57,475 --> 00:42:00,311
We don't know anything!

429
00:42:01,062 --> 00:42:04,273
Anything more than when we got here.

430
00:42:04,982 --> 00:42:08,403
And that's what I'm gonna write
in my field report.

431
00:42:09,904 --> 00:42:13,658
Let's get out of here, Mulder,
as fast as we can.

432
00:42:18,121 --> 00:42:21,708
<i>Colonel Budahas</i>
<i>was returned to his home...</i>

433
00:42:21,833 --> 00:42:26,838
<i>..though his own knowledge of his</i>
<i>disappearance is vague and inconclusive.</i>

434
00:42:26,921 --> 00:42:31,092
<i>Agent Mulder's insistence</i>
<i>that Budahas may have been a test pilot...</i>

435
00:42:31,175 --> 00:42:36,097
<i>..on a top-secret project involving aircraft</i>
<i>using recovered UFO technology...</i>

436
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,267
<i>..and may have suffered</i>
<i>stress-related trauma</i>

437
00:42:39,350 --> 00:42:42,437
<i>by flying these aircraft, is also inconclusive.</i>

438
00:42:42,562 --> 00:42:46,357
<i>Though this agent can corroborate</i>
<i>Agent Mulder's account...</i>

439
00:42:46,441 --> 00:42:51,571
<i>..of two unidentified flying objects</i>
<i>in the northern sky over Ellens Air Base...</i>

440
00:42:51,654 --> 00:42:55,116
<i>..their exact nature or design</i>
<i>could not be determined.</i>

441
00:42:55,199 --> 00:43:01,456
<i>Barring further authorised inquiry,</i>
<i>this case - file #DF101364 - is closed.</i>

442
00:43:46,459 --> 00:43:48,544
Your lives may be in danger.

443
00:43:48,628 --> 00:43:50,880
Why?

444
00:43:50,963 --> 00:43:54,217
You've seen things that weren't to be seen.

445
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:58,262
Care and discretion are now imperative.

446
00:43:58,346 --> 00:44:02,308
- I saw something...
- I can provide you with information...

447
00:44:02,391 --> 00:44:05,228
...but only if it's in <i>my</i> best interest.

448
00:44:05,311 --> 00:44:06,896
What is your interest?

449
00:44:06,979 --> 00:44:08,731
The truth.

450
00:44:10,274 --> 00:44:12,151
I <i>did</i> see something.

451
00:44:13,528 --> 00:44:16,989
But it's gone. They took it from me.

452
00:44:17,907 --> 00:44:19,992
They erased it.

453
00:44:21,035 --> 00:44:23,120
You have to tell me what it was.

454
00:44:23,204 --> 00:44:25,498
A military UFO?

455
00:44:33,172 --> 00:44:34,799
Mr Mulder...

456
00:44:34,882 --> 00:44:40,638
...why are those who believe in the existence
of extraterrestrial life on this earth...

457
00:44:40,721 --> 00:44:44,684
...not dissuaded
by all the evidence to the contrary?

458
00:44:44,767 --> 00:44:46,352
Because...

459
00:44:46,435 --> 00:44:52,692
...all the evidence to the contrary
is not entirely dissuasive.

460
00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:54,944
Precisely.

461
00:44:57,196 --> 00:44:59,282
They're here, aren't they?

462
00:45:00,575 --> 00:45:04,537
Mr Mulder,
<i>they've</i> been here for a long, long time.

463
00:45:44,327 --> 00:45:45,328
