1
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:22,858
We got a fire off County Road D7, two miles
west of the Canyon Ridge intersection.

2
00:00:22,941 --> 00:00:25,360
Suggest we dispatch fire crews. Over.

3
00:00:27,696 --> 00:00:30,407
This is Deputy Wright. Do you copy?

4
00:00:32,284 --> 00:00:34,369
Son of a...

5
00:00:54,139 --> 00:00:57,935
Sir? Sorry to disturb you,
but we've picked up an identified bogey.

6
00:00:58,018 --> 00:01:00,812
I think you should see
the replay for yourself.

7
00:01:12,699 --> 00:01:16,620
It tripped the fence at 23.17
off the coast of Connecticut, sir.

8
00:01:16,703 --> 00:01:19,998
Initial trajectory was north by northwest,
then it went crazy.

9
00:01:20,082 --> 00:01:22,251
What about other aircraft
or missile testing?

10
00:01:22,334 --> 00:01:24,878
No known aircraft can manoeuvre like this.

11
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,883
Whatever it was
dropped off the screen at 24.18, sir.

12
00:01:30,008 --> 00:01:33,637
Hit ground just west of Lake Michigan,
outside Townsend, Wisconsin.

13
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,599
The impact-prediction team
calculated impact at over 800mph.

14
00:01:39,017 --> 00:01:41,186
I've told Chief Koretz to start her report.

15
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:43,272
- Use these tapes to...
- Negative.

16
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:46,400
She tracked a meteor.

17
00:01:46,483 --> 00:01:49,319
Its aberrant movement
was due to instrument malfunction.

18
00:01:49,403 --> 00:01:53,198
- But, sir...
- Your report will reflect these facts. Clear?

19
00:01:53,282 --> 00:01:55,367
Yes, sir.

20
00:01:56,243 --> 00:01:58,120
Good.

21
00:02:06,086 --> 00:02:08,880
Code Indigo Delta Echo Niner.

22
00:02:08,964 --> 00:02:12,592
I have a confirmed fallen angel in sector 87.

23
00:02:12,718 --> 00:02:16,388
Mobilise Operation Falcon immediately.

24
00:02:33,113 --> 00:02:35,115
Hello?

25
00:03:46,812 --> 00:03:52,359
<i>They will have no comment until</i>
<i>the government investigation is completed.</i>

26
00:03:52,484 --> 00:03:56,113
<i>Government officials remain vague</i>
<i>about the toxic cargo...</i>

27
00:03:56,196 --> 00:04:01,743
<i>..that has caused the immediate evacuation</i>
<i>of Townsend, Wisconsin's 12,000 residents.</i>

28
00:04:01,827 --> 00:04:05,622
<i>Speculation here has centred on</i>
<i>a shipment of toxic waste.</i>

29
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:08,834
<i>Then what happened</i>
<i>if it wasn't a train wreck?</i>

30
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:13,922
<i>Mr Mulder, the continental</i>
<i>US is surrounded by an electronic fence...</i>

31
00:04:14,005 --> 00:04:17,759
<i>..that reaches 15,000 miles into space.</i>

32
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:25,642
We use it to track and monitor the 7,087
man-made objects that orbit the Earth.

33
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:29,855
Last night at 23.17 that fence was breached.

34
00:04:29,938 --> 00:04:34,860
This morning at 01.00
Operation Falcon went into effect...

35
00:04:34,943 --> 00:04:40,073
...led by Colonel Calvin Henderson,
the Air Force's premier reclamations expert.

36
00:04:40,198 --> 00:04:41,700
Reclamations?

37
00:04:41,783 --> 00:04:46,621
During the Cold War his job was to prevent
technologies from downed US aircraft...

38
00:04:46,705 --> 00:04:48,999
...from getting into Soviet hands.

39
00:04:49,082 --> 00:04:51,877
He's... part of a crash-retrieval unit?

40
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,045
Mm-hm.

41
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:56,465
Quick response.

42
00:04:56,548 --> 00:05:00,594
I'd say you have... 24 hours...

43
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:02,971
...before the entire area is sanitised.

44
00:05:03,054 --> 00:05:04,723
After that...

45
00:05:04,806 --> 00:05:07,559
...be like nothing ever happened.

46
00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:57,359
Let's go! Go! Go!

47
00:05:57,442 --> 00:05:59,528
On the double!

48
00:06:19,047 --> 00:06:21,132
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank <i>you.</i>

49
00:06:21,216 --> 00:06:23,510
Get it going. Let's go! Let's go!

50
00:06:27,138 --> 00:06:30,642
- All right, let's move out!
- Roadblock needs to be in place.

51
00:06:30,725 --> 00:06:33,228
All right. I'll get right on it, sir.

52
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:46,449
You're late. It's gonna be dark in a half-hour.

53
00:06:46,533 --> 00:06:48,410
We had a flat outside the perimeter, sir.

54
00:06:48,493 --> 00:06:52,622
There's a briefing at 22.00,
but first go to headquarters for live rounds.

55
00:06:52,706 --> 00:06:54,165
Live rounds, sir?

56
00:06:54,249 --> 00:06:57,836
- Got a problem with that?
- No, sir! We were told this is a drill.

57
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,005
- They told you wrong.
- Sir.

58
00:07:02,591 --> 00:07:05,719
OK, everyone out!
Come on, people! Light a fire!

59
00:09:37,412 --> 00:09:39,080
Argh!

60
00:09:49,174 --> 00:09:53,344
You just made the worst mistake
of your life, Agent Mulder.

61
00:09:55,889 --> 00:09:57,974
I think you knocked out a filling.

62
00:09:58,057 --> 00:10:01,102
I'll see to it you pay the price
for putting my men at risk.

63
00:10:01,186 --> 00:10:04,647
Since when does taking pictures
put anyone's life at risk?

64
00:10:04,731 --> 00:10:08,943
You violated a US government quarantine
and that's a federal crime.

65
00:10:09,027 --> 00:10:11,696
A quarantine? Is that what you call this?

66
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:15,408
We're trying to contain
an ecological disaster.

67
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:18,578
That's a lot of fire power
just to protect Mother Nature.

68
00:10:20,205 --> 00:10:22,248
I have my orders.

69
00:10:22,373 --> 00:10:25,168
And the license to execute them as I see fit.

70
00:10:25,251 --> 00:10:29,881
I suggest you forget what you saw
or what you <i>think</i> you saw...

71
00:10:29,964 --> 00:10:32,050
...for your own wellbeing.

72
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:37,514
You've got a downed craft in those woods,
sir, and troops carrying live rounds.

73
00:10:37,597 --> 00:10:39,891
We both know what's out there!

74
00:10:40,475 --> 00:10:42,393
Ah!

75
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:47,106
- Come on, move it.
- That's right, buddy. Get goin'.

76
00:10:48,066 --> 00:10:50,109
Get in there.

77
00:10:58,827 --> 00:11:01,663
You MUFON or CUFOS?

78
00:11:08,086 --> 00:11:10,129
Uh, do you mind if I sit down?

79
00:11:10,505 --> 00:11:14,008
No. Let me guess.
You're with that new group. CSICOP, right?

80
00:11:16,094 --> 00:11:21,099
Say no more. You're
a cautious man. Trust no one - very wise.

81
00:11:21,349 --> 00:11:24,853
After what happened to JFK,
I understand completely.

82
00:11:24,936 --> 00:11:26,938
Let me introduce myself.

83
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:28,231
Max Fenig.

84
00:11:28,314 --> 00:11:32,277
I'm with the National Investigative
Committee of Aerial Phenomena.

85
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:40,118
Uh, pleased... pleased
to make your acquaintance.

86
00:11:41,202 --> 00:11:44,247
I, uh, wish we could shake on it, you know?

87
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:48,126
Firm grip. Look right in the eye.
You learn a lot about a guy that way.

88
00:11:50,962 --> 00:11:54,132
Can I, um... Can I ask you a question?

89
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:56,926
Go ahead.

90
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,929
Did you see anything? Did you get close?

91
00:12:00,013 --> 00:12:03,433
- Me, I saw nothing.
- I didn't see anything!

92
00:12:03,516 --> 00:12:08,897
Nada. Zip. 100 yards past the roadblock they
nailed me. I have no idea how they did it.

93
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,901
I'm telling you,
it's like the Roswell cover-up all over again.

94
00:12:12,984 --> 00:12:16,487
What makes you so sure
there's something out there?

95
00:12:19,991 --> 00:12:22,702
Same thing that makes <i>you</i> so sure.

96
00:12:53,524 --> 00:12:55,652
I didn't order room service.

97
00:12:55,735 --> 00:12:57,820
This isn't funny, Mulder.

98
00:12:57,904 --> 00:13:00,198
- Did you meet Max?
- Who?

99
00:13:00,281 --> 00:13:02,367
Max from NICAP.

100
00:13:03,201 --> 00:13:05,286
Oh, they must have released him.

101
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:08,373
Another intrepid soul
in search of a close encounter.

102
00:13:08,456 --> 00:13:10,166
Is that what this is about?

103
00:13:10,249 --> 00:13:12,835
What else?

104
00:13:12,919 --> 00:13:15,713
Try explaining that
to Section Chief McGrath.

105
00:13:15,797 --> 00:13:19,926
He stepped over Blevins, ordering
a full inquiry with a recommendation...

106
00:13:20,051 --> 00:13:23,930
Mulder, he wants to shut down the X-Files
and he wants you out of the Bureau.

107
00:13:24,055 --> 00:13:26,140
What else is new?

108
00:13:26,224 --> 00:13:28,601
I don't understand you, Mulder!

109
00:13:28,726 --> 00:13:31,187
Why you're always defying protocol...

110
00:13:31,270 --> 00:13:33,439
...ignoring jurisdiction.

111
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:35,608
Because I know what I saw, Scully.

112
00:13:35,733 --> 00:13:39,612
There were no train tracks, so how could
it have been a derailed container?

113
00:13:39,737 --> 00:13:41,572
Because it wasn't.

114
00:13:41,656 --> 00:13:44,158
What you saw was not a toxic spill.

115
00:13:44,242 --> 00:13:46,327
But it wasn't a UFO either.

116
00:13:48,246 --> 00:13:50,289
OK, I'm all ears. What was it?

117
00:13:50,415 --> 00:13:53,918
It was a downed Libyan jet
with a nuclear warhead.

118
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,256
Over US airspace?

119
00:13:58,339 --> 00:14:01,050
They picked up low-grade
levels of radiation,

120
00:14:01,134 --> 00:14:03,720
so the plutonium casing may have cracked.

121
00:14:03,803 --> 00:14:05,638
So to avoid mass panic...

122
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:10,351
- You really believe that story?
- That story happens to be highly classified.

123
00:14:10,435 --> 00:14:12,812
A highly classified lie.

124
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:20,319
- They're searching for someone, Scully.
- Then it's probably the pilot.

125
00:14:20,445 --> 00:14:24,282
You think they'd roll out all this material
for one Libyan fighter jock?

126
00:14:26,659 --> 00:14:30,121
Besides, no human pilot
walked away from the wreckage I saw.

127
00:14:31,831 --> 00:14:33,958
Well, maybe he ejected.

128
00:14:35,626 --> 00:14:37,503
Maybe.

129
00:15:20,671 --> 00:15:22,715
You can't be serious.

130
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,885
As long as we're in beautiful
downtown Townsend, why not?

131
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:30,556
- The hearing is tomorrow at ten o'clock.
- That gives us 24 hours to investigate.

132
00:15:30,681 --> 00:15:34,018
My assignment is to bring you back,
not to dig you in deeper.

133
00:15:34,102 --> 00:15:36,604
<i>The Last Detail,</i> starring Dana Scully.

134
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:48,658
What's going on?

135
00:15:48,741 --> 00:15:51,786
Looks like housekeeping
hasn't been here yet.

136
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:53,121
- What...
- Sh!

137
00:16:19,230 --> 00:16:21,065
Max?

138
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,986
Get your hands up!

139
00:16:25,069 --> 00:16:27,405
- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
- Max?

140
00:16:32,952 --> 00:16:35,163
My apologies. Forgive me, please.

141
00:16:35,246 --> 00:16:37,915
I-I-I'm a curious man. I had to know.

142
00:16:37,999 --> 00:16:40,084
- Know what?
- If it was really you.

143
00:16:40,168 --> 00:16:43,337
But you don't know me.
Last night was the first time we met.

144
00:16:43,421 --> 00:16:47,008
Not true. NICAP have
followed your career closely

145
00:16:47,091 --> 00:16:48,885
ever since you got put on the X-Files.

146
00:16:48,968 --> 00:16:52,513
- Followed my career? How?
- With the Freedom of Information Act.

147
00:16:52,597 --> 00:16:55,433
Your travel expenses
are a matter of public record.

148
00:16:57,268 --> 00:17:01,105
So, uh, this must be
the... enigmatic Agent Scully.

149
00:17:03,441 --> 00:17:07,904
- How did you recognise me?
- I saw your picture in a trade publication...

150
00:17:07,987 --> 00:17:12,033
...and I read your article in Omni
about the Gulf Breeze sightings.

151
00:17:13,451 --> 00:17:16,787
- I published that under a pseudonym.
- MF Luder. I know.

152
00:17:16,871 --> 00:17:19,624
MF Luder's an anagram for F Mulder.

153
00:17:19,707 --> 00:17:23,002
You really didn't think
that would fool us, did you?

154
00:17:23,127 --> 00:17:26,172
I didn't think anybody was paying attention.

155
00:17:26,297 --> 00:17:29,425
Somebody's always paying attention,
Mr Mulder.

156
00:17:29,508 --> 00:17:31,719
Amazing.

157
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:34,263
Amazing? Hardly!

158
00:17:34,347 --> 00:17:38,017
Hey, you wanna see something amazing,
come with me.

159
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:42,021
"The <i>enigmatic</i> Dr Scully."

160
00:17:53,824 --> 00:17:56,535
This is my, uh... Right this way.

161
00:17:57,370 --> 00:17:59,121
Excuse the mess.

162
00:17:59,205 --> 00:18:02,333
Uh, OK. Where's those, uh...

163
00:18:06,754 --> 00:18:09,382
Let me turn this off. They're right here.

164
00:18:11,884 --> 00:18:13,344
Oh, here they are.

165
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:18,099
Latest crop circle photos
from Project Argus. Huh?

166
00:18:18,182 --> 00:18:21,644
- Fact or fraud?
<i>- </i> Fraud.

167
00:18:21,727 --> 00:18:24,480
How do you explain
the blisters on the plants?

168
00:18:24,563 --> 00:18:27,024
It's either a weathering effect...

169
00:18:27,108 --> 00:18:30,027
...or the plant's reaction
to being in one position.

170
00:18:30,111 --> 00:18:32,571
- You've read the literature.
- I try to keep up.

171
00:18:32,697 --> 00:18:35,366
- What about...
- Max, you had something to show us.

172
00:18:35,449 --> 00:18:36,575
Oh, yeah, yeah.

173
00:18:37,535 --> 00:18:39,996
The Wolf's Ear 2000. You ever hear of this?

174
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:43,833
Yeah. Wolf Industries supplies the CIA
with surveillance equipment.

175
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:47,628
State-of-the-art search and intercept.
100 channels per second.

176
00:18:47,712 --> 00:18:51,882
I'm jacked into local fire and police
departments, cellular phone pathways...

177
00:18:51,966 --> 00:18:56,470
...and, when the weather's right, air-traffic
control from Whitmarsh Air Force Base.

178
00:18:56,554 --> 00:18:57,930
What have you got?

179
00:18:59,098 --> 00:19:02,476
Mobile-unit broadcast in scan mode.

180
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,730
Townsend Sheriff's Department
two nights ago.

181
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:09,358
<i>We got a fire off County Road D7...</i>

182
00:19:09,442 --> 00:19:12,361
<i>..two miles west</i>
<i>of the Canyon Ridge intersection.</i>

183
00:19:12,445 --> 00:19:14,947
<i>Suggest we dispatch fire crews. Over.</i>

184
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:17,241
<i>This is Deputy Wright. Do you copy?</i>

185
00:19:17,950 --> 00:19:22,371
And then this, 35 minutes later,
presumably from the fire crew.

186
00:19:22,455 --> 00:19:24,874
Reception got wiggy for some reason.

187
00:19:24,957 --> 00:19:28,919
<i>This is Unit 53. Man down.</i>
<i>Request medevac.</i>

188
00:19:29,003 --> 00:19:31,297
<i>I said, request medevac!</i>

189
00:19:32,089 --> 00:19:36,469
<i>You're breaking up... barely... bad, very bad.</i>

190
00:19:36,594 --> 00:19:38,971
<i>Wait a sec. What the hell...?</i>

191
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:43,267
<i>Charlie! We got a situation here!</i>

192
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:46,562
We put up a tight net.

193
00:19:46,645 --> 00:19:51,525
Yes, sir. Every inch of ground is being
covered, dug up, squeezed and sifted.

194
00:19:51,609 --> 00:19:53,986
No, sir, it will not get away.

195
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:56,364
Not this time.

196
00:20:16,634 --> 00:20:18,302
Mrs Wright?

197
00:20:19,136 --> 00:20:22,431
Hi, I'm Fox Mulder. This is Dana Scully.
We're from the FBI.

198
00:20:22,515 --> 00:20:25,101
We have a few questions
about your husband.

199
00:20:25,184 --> 00:20:26,852
He's dead!

200
00:20:26,977 --> 00:20:29,021
What else is there to know?

201
00:20:35,653 --> 00:20:38,406
- I'm sorry about your husband.
- Oh, please!

202
00:20:38,489 --> 00:20:41,659
- Mrs Wright, we want to help you.
- Then leave me alone!

203
00:20:41,742 --> 00:20:45,329
- Why won't you let us help you?
- I don't know anything!

204
00:20:53,087 --> 00:20:55,464
Don't you understand?

205
00:20:55,548 --> 00:21:00,386
They won't even release the body
so I can give him a proper burial, OK?

206
00:21:00,511 --> 00:21:03,264
The government can't do that.

207
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:07,268
- I'm sure if we appeal to...
- No! You can't.

208
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:09,270
You're entitled to the truth.

209
00:21:09,353 --> 00:21:12,189
I can't afford the truth.

210
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:18,654
They said if I spoke to anyone,
they would withhold my husband's pension.

211
00:21:18,737 --> 00:21:21,031
And I have a child to take care of.

212
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:33,252
Picking up an extremely high
frequency signal. 200,000 megahertz.

213
00:21:33,377 --> 00:21:34,587
Sir.

214
00:21:34,712 --> 00:21:37,214
Target on the northeast side.

215
00:21:37,298 --> 00:21:40,384
7mph, sir.

216
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:43,012
- Beta team?
<i>- Copy.</i>

217
00:21:43,095 --> 00:21:45,473
Target entering your section.

218
00:21:45,556 --> 00:21:47,224
<i>Search and destroy.</i>

219
00:21:47,308 --> 00:21:49,685
<i>Search and destroy.</i>

220
00:21:49,768 --> 00:21:51,896
Yes, sir.

221
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:42,363
- Jackson?
- Nothing.

222
00:23:00,631 --> 00:23:03,133
Must have been an animal.

223
00:23:10,891 --> 00:23:12,977
Argh!

224
00:23:19,817 --> 00:23:24,863
I'm sorry, but unless you have a subpoena,
I can't discuss patient information.

225
00:23:24,989 --> 00:23:27,116
So Jason Wright <i>was</i> your patient?

226
00:23:27,199 --> 00:23:30,869
I have nothing more to say about this.

227
00:23:30,995 --> 00:23:34,999
What about to his wife and child?
Would you have anything to say to them?

228
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:37,668
Because whoever got to you also got to her.

229
00:23:37,751 --> 00:23:40,045
They must have made some big threats.

230
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:44,091
What'd they hold over your head?
Your medical license? The IRS?

231
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:48,137
- I hate fascists.
- Excuse me?

232
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:52,016
The men who came in here,
the way they pushed us all around.

233
00:23:55,728 --> 00:24:00,024
Dr Oppenheim, tell us about the deputy.
You saw him that night, didn't you?

234
00:24:01,859 --> 00:24:04,111
Yes, and three others from a fire crew.

235
00:24:04,194 --> 00:24:08,699
They were DOA with fifth-and sixth-degree
burns to over 90% of their bodies.

236
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:11,577
But they weren't like any burns I've seen...

237
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:14,913
...and they took the bodies
before we could perform pathology.

238
00:24:15,914 --> 00:24:19,084
Did you note any cadaveric heat rigor
or heat stiffening?

239
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:22,963
Yes, there was quite a bit of flexion
in the limbs. How do you know so much?

240
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:26,592
I did my residency in forensic medicine, so...

241
00:24:26,717 --> 00:24:31,972
Dr Oppenheim, could those burns
have been caused by ionising radiation?

242
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:34,808
Well, I hadn't thought...

243
00:24:34,892 --> 00:24:39,730
I suppose it's possible,
if the exposure were sufficiently intense.

244
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:45,152
Say the men died from radiation exposure.

245
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:49,907
- Can't it have been from a nuclear warhead?
- I've read about these kinds of burns.

246
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:54,453
- So have I, in Hiroshima at ground zero.
- I mean close-encounter mortalities.

247
00:24:54,578 --> 00:24:58,332
I have a stack of X-Files
reporting the same clinical results.

248
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:00,668
I don't claim to know all the answers...

249
00:25:00,751 --> 00:25:03,796
...but if we don't make
the OPR inquest by tomorrow...

250
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:05,964
...there may not be any more X-Files.

251
00:25:50,718 --> 00:25:53,846
Start an IV here.
D5, half-normal saline at 150.

252
00:25:53,971 --> 00:25:58,517
- Tell us what happened out there.
- Mulder, it has nothing to do with you.

253
00:25:58,642 --> 00:26:02,438
Wrong, Colonel. We both want
the same thing, only you want it dead.

254
00:26:02,521 --> 00:26:07,025
Can't you see by chasing it like an animal
you leave it no choice but to defend itself?

255
00:26:07,151 --> 00:26:10,571
How many more have to die
before you rethink your approach?

256
00:26:10,654 --> 00:26:13,824
Listen to me, cos I'm not
wasting another breath on this.

257
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:18,287
- If you two aren't outta here in 30 seconds...
- Agent Scully stays here!

258
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:21,039
We're undermanned, she's a doctor.
She stays.

259
00:26:21,165 --> 00:26:23,333
- If that's OK with you.
- Of course.

260
00:26:23,417 --> 00:26:27,379
Doctor, if you don't mind, just take care
of my men and let me do my work, OK?

261
00:26:30,007 --> 00:26:32,843
Outside this emergency room
you can do whatever you want,

262
00:26:32,926 --> 00:26:35,012
but here I call the shots.

263
00:26:35,846 --> 00:26:40,017
Assuming, of course,
you want me to take care of your men.

264
00:26:42,895 --> 00:26:44,772
Get this man out of my sight.

265
00:26:44,855 --> 00:26:46,940
Yes, sir.

266
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,444
Where do I scrub up?

267
00:27:06,251 --> 00:27:08,128
Max?

268
00:27:09,087 --> 00:27:11,215
Hey, Max?

269
00:27:11,882 --> 00:27:13,967
Max?

270
00:27:56,093 --> 00:27:57,928
Hey, Max.

271
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:01,473
Who are... who are you?

272
00:28:03,809 --> 00:28:05,936
Max, it's me. Fox Mulder.

273
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:09,439
You OK?

274
00:28:10,774 --> 00:28:12,860
What are you doing here?

275
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:19,658
You were having some kind of seizure.

276
00:28:19,783 --> 00:28:22,077
Seizure?

277
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,288
That's impossible.

278
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:34,047
You were lying on the floor unconscious,
convulsing.

279
00:28:35,173 --> 00:28:37,509
That's odd.

280
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:42,180
I haven't had an episode in seven years,
not since I went on medication.

281
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:47,895
- Let's get you to the hospital.
- No!

282
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:50,814
I mean, it's not necessary.

283
00:28:50,898 --> 00:28:53,817
- Sure?
- Yeah, I've lived with epilepsy all my life.

284
00:28:53,901 --> 00:28:55,986
I'm not in any danger.

285
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:13,587
Yeah, it started in South Dakota
when I was ten.

286
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:17,299
The doctor said I must have
incurred a head injury.

287
00:29:17,382 --> 00:29:19,635
I don't remember ever hitting my head.

288
00:29:19,718 --> 00:29:22,387
When you have seizure,
you have no memory of it?

289
00:29:24,014 --> 00:29:29,019
As a kid I used to wake up in strange places
with no idea where I was or how I got there.

290
00:29:35,525 --> 00:29:36,985
I'm sorry. I got...

291
00:29:37,069 --> 00:29:39,696
- I gotta... I gotta go sleep.
- All right.

292
00:30:37,337 --> 00:30:39,256
Rough night, huh?

293
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:41,675
It was terrible.

294
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:44,094
We lost all but two.

295
00:30:44,177 --> 00:30:49,099
They're still in critical condition, on their
way to the burn unit at Johns Hopkins.

296
00:30:50,183 --> 00:30:53,603
So what do you think, Scully?
What's going on out there?

297
00:30:54,646 --> 00:30:56,523
I don't know.

298
00:30:56,606 --> 00:31:00,110
And, under other circumstances,
I would like to find out...

299
00:31:00,193 --> 00:31:03,321
...but we have a plane to catch
in just over an hour.

300
00:31:03,447 --> 00:31:06,283
I want you to take a look at something first.

301
00:31:06,366 --> 00:31:08,785
- What?
- Max.

302
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:14,124
There's an unusual incision behind his
left ear. I've seen this incision twice before.

303
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:18,003
Two women 1,000 miles apart.

304
00:31:18,128 --> 00:31:20,380
No way of knowing each other, no relation.

305
00:31:20,464 --> 00:31:23,300
Both claim to have been abducted by aliens.

306
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:27,554
Are you saying Max Fenig is an abductee?

307
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:30,724
Mulder...

308
00:31:30,807 --> 00:31:35,937
...the man is taking powerful
anti-psychotic drugs. I saw them in his RV.

309
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:38,482
- They're for his epilepsy.
- Not all of them.

310
00:31:38,565 --> 00:31:44,571
Dilantin is an anticonvulsant, but Mellaril
is used exclusively to treat schizophrenia.

311
00:31:44,654 --> 00:31:46,990
More than likely, Max is delusional.

312
00:31:47,908 --> 00:31:49,993
You don't understand, Scully.

313
00:31:50,077 --> 00:31:53,663
Max doesn't believe
he was abducted by aliens. I believe he was.

314
00:31:55,707 --> 00:31:59,836
Now, could you at least look at the scar
and give me your medical opinion?

315
00:32:03,548 --> 00:32:05,634
OK.

316
00:32:05,717 --> 00:32:08,970
You pack, I'll take a look at Max...

317
00:32:09,054 --> 00:32:11,181
...on the way to the airport.

318
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:16,853
Sir, I have flash traffic at 24.18.

319
00:32:18,188 --> 00:32:20,899
Repeated calls for ID go unanswered

320
00:32:20,982 --> 00:32:23,151
and it's not in the orbital
or suborbital inventory.

321
00:32:23,235 --> 00:32:26,404
- 24.18. Isn't that where...?
- Same exact spot, sir.

322
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:28,949
Though I am reading a larger craft this time.

323
00:32:29,032 --> 00:32:30,450
Meteor, Miss Koretz.

324
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:34,121
A much larger <i>meteor,</i>... sir.

325
00:32:34,204 --> 00:32:36,123
<i>Whitmarsh Tracking SSC. We have a bogey.</i>

326
00:32:36,206 --> 00:32:37,624
Hold on a second.

327
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:40,877
We have a confirm.
Whitmarsh Air Force Base is tracking.

328
00:32:40,961 --> 00:32:43,880
- Where is it?
<i>- Sector 35, 53,0ooft, zero velocity.</i>

329
00:32:43,964 --> 00:32:49,344
Well, sir, the <i>meteor</i> seems to be hovering
over a small town in eastern Wisconsin.

330
00:32:49,427 --> 00:32:51,304
<i>We have a bogey. Confirm.</i>

331
00:33:47,277 --> 00:33:50,655
Come on, Mulder. Let's get this over with.

332
00:33:52,157 --> 00:33:54,284
Hey, Max?

333
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:56,036
Max!

334
00:33:58,038 --> 00:33:59,956
Max?

335
00:34:00,665 --> 00:34:03,168
- Hey, Max?

336
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:11,343
Max?

337
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:13,887
Mulder, look at this.

338
00:34:14,846 --> 00:34:17,140
What is that? Blood?

339
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:27,108
<i>Falcon Patrol</i>
<i>reporting unidentified trespass.</i>

340
00:34:27,192 --> 00:34:32,405
<i>Falcon Patrol reporting unidentified</i>
<i>trespass at the waterfront. Dock 7.</i>

341
00:34:36,993 --> 00:34:38,662
- Mulder!
- Come on!

342
00:34:38,745 --> 00:34:40,830
Where do you think you're going?

343
00:34:40,914 --> 00:34:44,000
If we go to the airport now,
we might make the plane...

344
00:34:44,084 --> 00:34:47,087
...which would give you a chance
of defending yourself.

345
00:34:47,170 --> 00:34:50,465
Think about it, Scully.
Max is a gypsy, a nomad, right?

346
00:34:50,548 --> 00:34:52,217
Yeah. So what?

347
00:34:52,342 --> 00:34:54,970
So he intercepted
Deputy Wright's last call...

348
00:34:55,053 --> 00:34:58,556
...which means he was here in Townsend
the night of the crash.

349
00:34:58,682 --> 00:35:01,393
Of all the places he could have been,
he was here.

350
00:35:01,518 --> 00:35:03,979
Don't you think
it's more than a coincidence?

351
00:35:04,062 --> 00:35:07,315
If Max was abducted,
that would explain his obsessions.

352
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:10,360
And if we figured that out,
Henderson has as well.

353
00:35:10,443 --> 00:35:12,529
D'you have the keys?

354
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:44,477
- Don't do this!
- Sir, we have the target. It's just a civilian.

355
00:35:44,561 --> 00:35:47,772
Negative, Falcon Patrol.
Take him with extreme caution.

356
00:36:10,003 --> 00:36:12,297
- They're dead.

357
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:27,896
It hurts. Stop.

358
00:36:27,979 --> 00:36:29,564
Why, why, why, why?

359
00:36:29,647 --> 00:36:32,192
It hurts. It hurts. It hurts...

360
00:36:32,275 --> 00:36:34,444
- Max?
- It hurts. It hurts.

361
00:36:34,527 --> 00:36:37,572
Stop it, it hurts. It hurts. Stop it, it hurts...

362
00:36:37,655 --> 00:36:40,700
- It's all right.
- Stop it, it hurts...

363
00:36:40,784 --> 00:36:43,953
No. No, it's me.
They're coming for me.

364
00:36:45,538 --> 00:36:48,666
Now I know that's...
that's why they're coming for... me.

365
00:36:50,627 --> 00:36:52,962
- It hurts, uh...
- Keep 'em out.

366
00:37:06,476 --> 00:37:08,395
Alpha team, secure the roof.

367
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:14,984
Hold it right there!
Put your hands up and come with us!

368
00:37:17,028 --> 00:37:19,114
Give me a hand now!

369
00:37:19,197 --> 00:37:21,324
Go! Go! Go!

370
00:37:23,326 --> 00:37:25,412
Quadrant 4, move in!

371
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:32,419
Alpha team ready on the roof.

372
00:37:34,045 --> 00:37:36,423
Roger, Alpha. Delta team, report.

373
00:37:36,506 --> 00:37:38,591
<i>Delta team in position, sir.</i>

374
00:37:41,553 --> 00:37:44,597
What are you doing?
You have a very sick man in there.

375
00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:48,560
We're not in the hospital now, Dr Scully.
Omega team report.

376
00:37:48,685 --> 00:37:52,105
<i>- Omega team in position.</i>
- He's a delusional schizophrenic.

377
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:54,274
Keep her clear.

378
00:37:54,941 --> 00:38:00,071
Sir, this is Alpha team leader. I'm picking up
three forms inside the structure.

379
00:38:00,196 --> 00:38:02,282
Did you say three forms?

380
00:38:02,365 --> 00:38:04,534
<i>That's affirmative.</i>

381
00:38:04,617 --> 00:38:06,619
Two are proximate.

382
00:38:08,037 --> 00:38:09,914
The third...

383
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:12,083
...approaching from 40 metres.

384
00:38:14,627 --> 00:38:17,255
All teams, prepare for go in 30 seconds.

385
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,632
Come on! Come on, Max.

386
00:38:19,716 --> 00:38:21,801
<i>Come on, stop. Why...</i>

387
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:23,970
I'm here to help you.

388
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:28,099
- I'm scared.
- I know.

389
00:38:28,224 --> 00:38:32,103
- Don't let 'em take me.
- I won't let 'em take you.

390
00:38:32,228 --> 00:38:34,731
Come on, Max. Come with me.

391
00:38:35,899 --> 00:38:37,775
No!

392
00:38:38,568 --> 00:38:40,403
Argh!

393
00:38:45,408 --> 00:38:47,285
Max!

394
00:38:53,791 --> 00:38:55,668
Max!

395
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,428
Max!

396
00:39:13,311 --> 00:39:14,604
Max!

397
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:44,008
<i>Sir, this is Alpha team leader. Except for our</i>
<i>men, I'm only picking up one figure inside.</i>

398
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:45,552
I did not copy that.

399
00:39:45,635 --> 00:39:49,264
We indicate only one figure
inside the building.

400
00:39:49,347 --> 00:39:52,308
- What?
<i>- </i> Blow the door!

401
00:39:55,478 --> 00:39:57,522
Take him!

402
00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:11,536
Where is he?

403
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:14,831
He's gone.

404
00:40:14,914 --> 00:40:18,501
They got to him first. They beat us, Colonel.

405
00:40:19,544 --> 00:40:21,671
Arrest him.

406
00:40:23,339 --> 00:40:25,425
And keep looking!

407
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:35,184
Agent Scully, to the best of your knowledge,
was Agent Mulder ever assigned...

408
00:40:35,268 --> 00:40:39,981
...to investigate matters related to
the evacuation of Townsend, Wisconsin?

409
00:40:40,064 --> 00:40:41,941
No, sir.

410
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:45,570
At any time were you aware of
his submitting a form 302...

411
00:40:45,695 --> 00:40:49,073
...requesting said assignment
or travel expenses?

412
00:40:49,198 --> 00:40:50,992
No, sir.

413
00:40:51,075 --> 00:40:55,747
While in Wisconsin,
did Agent Mulder drive a blue Ford Taurus...

414
00:40:55,872 --> 00:40:58,458
...registered to the State Car Rental Agency?

415
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:00,418
Yes, sir.

416
00:41:00,543 --> 00:41:02,587
Thank you, Agent Scully.

417
00:41:02,712 --> 00:41:05,048
Sir, request permission
to make a statement.

418
00:41:05,131 --> 00:41:06,549
Request denied.

419
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:09,761
Sir, it's unfair to judge Mulder
by the same criteria...

420
00:41:09,886 --> 00:41:12,513
You're dismissed, Agent Scully.

421
00:41:12,597 --> 00:41:15,391
- But, sir...
- That will be all!

422
00:41:27,904 --> 00:41:31,699
D'you hear that noise, Scully?
Hammer and nails.

423
00:41:31,783 --> 00:41:34,827
They're building a gallows
in the town square.

424
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,955
Don't worry.

425
00:41:38,081 --> 00:41:39,916
It was only a matter of time.

426
00:41:39,999 --> 00:41:42,168
I'm surprised I lasted this long.

427
00:41:43,294 --> 00:41:45,380
Good luck.

428
00:41:45,463 --> 00:41:47,590
I'll break a leg.

429
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:10,446
<i>..As well as</i>
<i>insubordination and misconduct.</i>

430
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:14,992
How do you respond to these allegations,
Agent Mulder?

431
00:42:15,118 --> 00:42:19,872
Over a dozen men lost their lives, and you
want me to respond to issues of protocol?

432
00:42:19,956 --> 00:42:23,376
You failed to obtain proper authorisation.

433
00:42:23,459 --> 00:42:25,139
Because I knew it wouldn't be forthcoming.

434
00:42:25,169 --> 00:42:29,257
- And violated a Federal Quarantine Area...
- A cover-up was under way!

435
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:32,927
...exposing yourself and possibly others
to toxic contamination.

436
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:35,179
Toxic contamination! We back in that?

437
00:42:35,304 --> 00:42:38,057
You read my report.
Explain Fenig's disappearance.

438
00:42:38,141 --> 00:42:40,601
Your report is not the subject of this inquiry.

439
00:42:40,685 --> 00:42:42,729
I have further evidence!

440
00:42:42,812 --> 00:42:47,608
X-rays of Mr Fenig when institutionalised
show an object lodged in his cerebellum.

441
00:42:47,692 --> 00:42:49,777
That is irrelevant, Agent Mulder.

442
00:42:49,861 --> 00:42:53,322
The man was abducted.
We all know it. Everybody here knows it!

443
00:42:53,406 --> 00:42:57,285
Colonel Henderson's
written testimony states...

444
00:42:57,368 --> 00:43:01,330
...that Fenig's body was found
two hours later in a cargo container.

445
00:43:06,335 --> 00:43:08,421
Then what can I say?

446
00:43:10,006 --> 00:43:13,843
How can I disprove lies
that are stamped with an official seal?

447
00:43:13,926 --> 00:43:16,429
That will be all, Mr Mulder.

448
00:43:16,512 --> 00:43:21,684
You can deny all the things I have
seen, all the things I have discovered...

449
00:43:21,768 --> 00:43:23,644
...but not for much longer.

450
00:43:23,728 --> 00:43:26,773
Cos too many others
know what's happening out there.

451
00:43:26,856 --> 00:43:29,275
And <i>no-one...</i>

452
00:43:29,358 --> 00:43:33,196
...no government agency
has jurisdiction over the truth.

453
00:44:04,977 --> 00:44:07,438
Why did you countermand our decision?

454
00:44:07,563 --> 00:44:09,857
Mulder's conduct was in clear violation,

455
00:44:09,941 --> 00:44:12,652
not only of Bureau procedures,
but of federal law.

456
00:44:12,735 --> 00:44:14,195
Yes.

457
00:44:14,278 --> 00:44:18,074
I don't know understand.
The committee's case was airtight.

458
00:44:18,157 --> 00:44:21,118
You ruined our last chance to get rid of him.

459
00:44:21,244 --> 00:44:23,496
I appreciate your frustration...

460
00:44:23,579 --> 00:44:27,625
...but you and I both know
that Mulder's work is, uh...

461
00:44:27,750 --> 00:44:30,253
...his singular passion.

462
00:44:30,336 --> 00:44:32,839
Poses a most unique dilemma.

463
00:44:34,131 --> 00:44:39,387
But his occasional insubordination
is, in the end, far less dangerous.

464
00:44:39,470 --> 00:44:42,473
With respect, sir,
less dangerous than what?

465
00:44:42,598 --> 00:44:46,435
Than having him expose
to the wrong people...

466
00:44:46,519 --> 00:44:48,729
...what he knows.

467
00:44:48,813 --> 00:44:51,524
What he thinks he knows.

468
00:44:52,942 --> 00:44:58,114
Always keep your friends close,
Mr McGrath.

469
00:44:59,866 --> 00:45:02,368
But keep your enemies closer.

470
00:45:32,064 --> 00:45:35,151
Natasha Cohn

471
00:45:47,663 --> 00:45:49,332
<i>I made this!</i>
