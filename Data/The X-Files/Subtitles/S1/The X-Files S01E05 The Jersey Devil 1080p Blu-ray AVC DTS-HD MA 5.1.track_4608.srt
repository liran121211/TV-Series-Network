1
00:00:06,966 --> 00:00:11,804
B-I-N-G-O, B-I-N-G-O,
and Bingo was his name-o

2
00:00:11,888 --> 00:00:15,933
There was a farmer had a dog
and Bingo was his name-o

3
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:19,937
B-I-N-G-O, B-I-N-G-O

4
00:00:20,021 --> 00:00:23,900
B-I-N-G-O, and Bingo was his name-o

5
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:27,904
There was a farmer had a dog
and Bingo was his name-o

6
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:30,573
- Ah! What was that?
- What's happening?

7
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:32,950
It's OK, it's OK. I just had a flat.

8
00:00:33,034 --> 00:00:35,286
- Oh, no!
- No problem here, honey.

9
00:00:54,472 --> 00:00:56,557
Darn it!

10
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:20,164
Honey, would you hold the light?

11
00:01:20,248 --> 00:01:21,707
- Aagh!
- Paul!

12
00:01:23,376 --> 00:01:25,503
Paul!

13
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,005
Paul!

14
00:01:30,675 --> 00:01:32,760
Where are you, Paul?!

15
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:36,347
What happened?!

16
00:01:37,348 --> 00:01:39,433
Paul!

17
00:01:41,686 --> 00:01:43,854
<i>(dogs barking/people shouting)</i>

18
00:02:04,542 --> 00:02:06,711
Over here! I've found something!

19
00:02:18,889 --> 00:02:21,309
His leg's been eaten off.

20
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:26,564
Hey! Up here!

21
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:29,150
I need some help!

22
00:02:39,577 --> 00:02:40,995
It's in here! It's as tall as a house!

23
00:02:42,246 --> 00:02:44,749
- We can smoke him out.
- And then what?

24
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,755
- I see it!
- He's coming at us!

25
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:53,984
Agent Finley speaking.

26
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:02,868
Working hard, Mulder?

27
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:06,080
This woman claims she was
taken aboard a spaceship...

28
00:04:06,163 --> 00:04:09,041
...and held in an anti-gravity chamber
for three days.

29
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,210
Anti-gravity is right.

30
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:17,049
Sorry to interrupt
your serious investigation.

31
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:20,803
- I heard a story that” take your knees out.
- What's that?

32
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:24,223
They found a body
in the New Jersey woods yesterday...

33
00:04:24,348 --> 00:04:26,642
...missing its right arm and shoulder.

34
00:04:26,725 --> 00:04:30,688
They think
they may have been eaten off... by a human.

35
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,567
- Where in New Jersey?
- Just outside Atlantic City.

36
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:38,529
Not an uncommon place to lose a body part.
They think it's the Mob?

37
00:04:38,612 --> 00:04:41,449
He was a homeless man.
There's no motive.

38
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:45,494
You feeling lucky, Scully?

39
00:04:45,578 --> 00:04:47,663
Relative to whom?

40
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:53,919
It's not our case, Mulder.
The local police are handling it.

41
00:04:54,003 --> 00:04:55,921
An X-File?

42
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:58,966
Ever hear of something
called the Jersey Devil?

43
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:03,053
A beast that's supposed to come out
of the woods and attack cars...

44
00:05:03,137 --> 00:05:05,222
...like an East Coast Bigfoot.

45
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:08,058
Read the file about the case in 1947.

46
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:13,814
Save me the trouble.

47
00:05:13,898 --> 00:05:17,318
1947. Family watches Dad
get dragged off into the woods.

48
00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:20,070
Cops find Dad
with a few appendages gnawed off.

49
00:05:20,196 --> 00:05:23,449
Cops corner a large, naked man
in the woods and gun him down.

50
00:05:23,532 --> 00:05:28,329
Autopsy shows human flesh and bones
in his intestine. A beast man.

51
00:05:28,412 --> 00:05:31,290
- Is the autopsy report here?
- Requisition for a car.

52
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:35,336
The original disappeared
from the files after the incident.

53
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:40,674
- There is a statement from the pathologist.
- I've heard this story since I was a kid.

54
00:05:40,758 --> 00:05:41,967
It's a folk tale, a myth.

55
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:45,012
I heard the same story
when I was a kid, too.

56
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:48,140
Funny thing is, I believed it. Thanks, Doreen.

57
00:05:48,265 --> 00:05:51,644
Fact is, we've got
a cannibalised body in New Jersey.

58
00:05:51,769 --> 00:05:54,438
Someone or something out there is hungry.

59
00:06:03,989 --> 00:06:09,328
They say animals can develop an appetite
for human flesh, but... this is no animal.

60
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:12,373
See the teeth marks,
just below the clavicle?

61
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:14,583
They're human.

62
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,419
- Who found the body?
- A park ranger.

63
00:06:17,503 --> 00:06:19,588
Was he alive when it happened?

64
00:06:19,672 --> 00:06:21,215
It's hard to tell.

65
00:06:21,298 --> 00:06:24,969
There's no sign of a struggle.
His blood alcohol level was up.

66
00:06:25,094 --> 00:06:28,556
- Probably never knew what hit him.
- Any ideas about that?

67
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,351
From the size of that bite mark,
I'd say large, adult male.

68
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:35,563
- Detective Thompson is handling the case.
- Glenna?

69
00:06:35,646 --> 00:06:39,608
Hi. I'm Special Agent Dana Scully
and this is Agent Fox Mulder.

70
00:06:39,692 --> 00:06:43,028
I don't remember anybody
calling the FBI in on this.

71
00:06:43,153 --> 00:06:46,657
We're not here officially.
Agent Scully is a medical doctor.

72
00:06:46,782 --> 00:06:49,994
We heard about your victim
and thought we'd look.

73
00:06:50,619 --> 00:06:53,038
I'm sorry. I'm going to ask you to leave.

74
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:56,792
- We have an investigation.
- Tommy, this is no time to get pissy.

75
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,628
- We have jurisdiction here.
- Any suspects yet?

76
00:06:59,712 --> 00:07:01,797
I don't work for you, sir.

77
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:05,676
Unless you hear from the attorney general,
this is a local matter.

78
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:09,722
- Agent Mulder, we should go.
- No need to get bent out of shape!

79
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:13,892
On the contrary,
I think I've been exceedingly polite.

80
00:07:22,526 --> 00:07:26,363
- So what's eating that guy?
- He was perfectly in his rights.

81
00:07:26,488 --> 00:07:30,242
The FBI has no overriding jurisdiction
in a murder case.

82
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:33,370
You'd feel the same
if someone horned in on your work.

83
00:07:33,495 --> 00:07:38,167
Chances are, he'll be scratching his head
when they bring the next body in.

84
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:43,088
You could have really humiliated him
and told him who the perpetrator was.

85
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,507
The Jersey Devil.

86
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:53,557
What do you say we grab a hotel, take in
a floor show, drop quarters in the slot...

87
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:55,476
...do a little digging.

88
00:07:55,559 --> 00:07:58,062
- You're kidding?
- OK, skip the floor show.

89
00:07:58,187 --> 00:08:01,357
- Mulder, I have to be back in DC.
- Have you got a date?

90
00:08:02,066 --> 00:08:03,609
No.

91
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:06,403
I have my godson's birthday party at 6.30.

92
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:13,827
- What are you doing?
- A little poking around.

93
00:08:13,911 --> 00:08:18,582
- Maybe make a weekend out of it.
- It's a three-hour drive back by myself.

94
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,085
In Friday night traffic.

95
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:33,889
Change of fifty.

96
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:06,839
I found the bodyjust over there,
lying face down on the rocks.

97
00:09:07,923 --> 00:09:12,052
32 years with the Parks Service,
I've seen some weird stuff...

98
00:09:12,136 --> 00:09:14,054
...but never anything like this.

99
00:09:14,138 --> 00:09:18,016
The victim was a homeless man.
You get many wandering around?

100
00:09:18,142 --> 00:09:21,145
Well, occasionally, you'll see some, but...

101
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,313
Most are scared of the woods.

102
00:09:23,647 --> 00:09:25,691
Scared? Of what?

103
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:27,860
I don't know.

104
00:09:27,985 --> 00:09:30,028
The devil.

105
00:09:31,321 --> 00:09:34,783
- People say that's just a myth.
- Depends on who you talk to.

106
00:09:34,867 --> 00:09:36,952
What do you think?

107
00:09:37,035 --> 00:09:39,121
Well, like I said...

108
00:09:39,204 --> 00:09:41,331
...32 years...

109
00:09:41,832 --> 00:09:43,959
...I see a lot of weird stuff.

110
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:50,841
Like one time...

111
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,719
...a little over four years ago...

112
00:09:55,179 --> 00:09:57,264
...I saw what I thought was...

113
00:09:57,347 --> 00:09:59,349
...a large man...

114
00:09:59,475 --> 00:10:03,395
...come out of a copse of birch trees.
Not a stitch of clothing.

115
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,356
He was about sixty yards away.

116
00:10:06,482 --> 00:10:09,818
And he starts sniffing the air,
you know, like a dog.

117
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:15,741
And then he looked straight at me,
and I swear he smelled me...

118
00:10:15,866 --> 00:10:20,329
...because he took off into the woods so fast
you'd swear he wasn't human.

119
00:10:20,412 --> 00:10:21,955
Really?

120
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:24,166
- You never saw him again?
- No.

121
00:10:26,752 --> 00:10:29,087
But I feel him.

122
00:10:30,255 --> 00:10:33,133
And... I've found things.

123
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:35,302
Some scat...

124
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:38,263
...half-buried, like a cat's, only more human.

125
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:42,851
Found a half-eaten rabbit with
what looked like a human cuspid tooth...

126
00:10:42,935 --> 00:10:46,980
...and deer bones, looked like
they'd been sharpened into tools.

127
00:10:47,064 --> 00:10:50,234
You think it's responsible
for the body you found?

128
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:53,695
Well...

129
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:56,865
I got a pension coming up in a few years.

130
00:10:56,949 --> 00:11:00,869
You know, you say the wrong thing...
I'll tell you one thing.

131
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:05,249
I don't ever come out here
without my weapon any more.

132
00:11:07,251 --> 00:11:09,378
How far is it into town from here?

133
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:12,506
About a mile, a mile and a half.

134
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:16,093
I'm staying at the Galaxy Gateway
for a couple of days.

135
00:11:16,218 --> 00:11:19,429
- If you think of anything, will you call me?
- Sure.

136
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:31,775
<i>(child laughs)</i> Look at this gorilla outfit!

137
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,778
Where am I? I can't see!

138
00:11:36,113 --> 00:11:38,156
<i>(child cries)</i>

139
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,495
It's OK. It's all right.

140
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,123
What happened? Did you bump your head?

141
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:49,334
Cruiser! Stop that!

142
00:11:51,253 --> 00:11:53,005
Go on.

143
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,173
What happened?

144
00:11:55,299 --> 00:11:57,885
- Jungle warfare.
- I could kill that dog.

145
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:01,096
If the hit squad
doesn't get to him before you do.

146
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:03,265
I am so glad you're here, Dana.

147
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:05,976
<i>(child)</i> Hey! Get off me! Cruiser!

148
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,104
<i>(Ellen)</i> Cruiser, get down!

149
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:21,533
Oh!

150
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,702
- You're amazing.
- What?

151
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:27,372
You're a natural.
I don't know how you keep it together.

152
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:29,541
Mommy radar.

153
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:32,586
I don't think I'm out out for this, El.

154
00:12:32,669 --> 00:12:37,007
You went to the FBI Academy.
What better training for motherhood?

155
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:41,511
Seriously. You're great with kids.
What do you mean?

156
00:12:41,678 --> 00:12:45,182
- When do I find the time?
- First you have to get a life.

157
00:12:45,307 --> 00:12:47,809
Of course, it helps if you can find a man.

158
00:12:47,893 --> 00:12:51,021
- Know of any?
- They're disappearing faster...

159
00:12:51,146 --> 00:12:53,357
...than the Brazilian rainforest.

160
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:56,318
- What about that guy you work with?
- Mulder?

161
00:12:56,401 --> 00:13:00,989
- I thought you said he was cute. - He's a jerk. He's not a jerk. He's... um...

162
00:13:01,073 --> 00:13:03,075
He's obsessed with his work.

163
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:34,481
Hi. I'm Rob. Scott's dad.

164
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:37,609
- Oh! Come in.
- Thanks.

165
00:13:37,734 --> 00:13:39,111
Hey, tiger!

166
00:13:39,236 --> 00:13:42,656
How you doing?
You having a good time?

167
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,866
<i>(Whispers)</i> Divorced.

168
00:14:27,284 --> 00:14:29,786
Did anybody here know Roger Crockett?

169
00:14:32,330 --> 00:14:34,958
He was murdered two days ago.

170
00:14:40,297 --> 00:14:41,465
Ma'am, can I...

171
00:14:44,843 --> 00:14:46,762
Roger Crockett?

172
00:14:46,845 --> 00:14:48,764
Anybody?

173
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,770
What do you want to know?

174
00:14:54,853 --> 00:14:56,938
Did you know Roger Crockett?

175
00:14:57,022 --> 00:14:59,107
Did you hear how he died?

176
00:14:59,191 --> 00:15:01,318
Yeah.

177
00:15:01,693 --> 00:15:04,196
Any ideas who might have done it?

178
00:15:04,821 --> 00:15:06,865
You a cop?

179
00:15:06,990 --> 00:15:09,034
No, I'm FBI.

180
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:12,662
I'll show you something.

181
00:15:12,788 --> 00:15:14,164
OK.

182
00:15:20,879 --> 00:15:23,006
I need some money.

183
00:16:07,342 --> 00:16:10,846
- What is this?
- Stuck in the pocket of a jacket I found.

184
00:16:12,264 --> 00:16:14,349
Does it mean anything to you?

185
00:16:14,432 --> 00:16:16,560
- I've seen it.
- Where?

186
00:16:16,768 --> 00:16:19,521
- Right here, digging in the trash.
- Here?

187
00:16:19,896 --> 00:16:21,982
Are you hustling me?

188
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,192
Swear to God.

189
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:26,820
- What do you think it is?
- I don't know.

190
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,989
It scared the hell out of me.

191
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:32,826
- Has anybody else seen it?
- Everybody's pretty freaked.

192
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:36,621
- Anybody told the cops?
- What, you think they don't know?

193
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:46,715
- Where are you sleeping tonight?
- You're standing in my bedroom.

194
00:16:46,798 --> 00:16:49,217
You know the Galaxy Gateway?

195
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:52,596
Room 756.

196
00:16:54,264 --> 00:16:56,308
Go ahead.

197
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:01,062
They got HBO?

198
00:17:01,938 --> 00:17:03,940
Yeah. They do.

199
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:35,013
<i>(thud)</i>

200
00:17:38,433 --> 00:17:40,477

201
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,543

<i>(whistles)</i>

203
00:19:35,717 --> 00:19:39,346
- We've got a man up on that roof.
- Nothing to be afraid of.

204
00:19:39,429 --> 00:19:40,638
We can give you
a warm place to sleep it off.

205
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:43,099
Hey! Back off!

206
00:19:43,224 --> 00:19:46,186
- There's a man up on that roof!
- Get in the car! Now!

207
00:19:53,443 --> 00:19:58,656
- What the hell are you doing?!
- Enjoying the nightlife here in Atlantic City.

208
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:01,534
I'll go right to the DA's office if I have to.

209
00:20:01,618 --> 00:20:06,456
- Obstructing an investigation. Misconduct.
- Let's go see her together.

210
00:20:06,581 --> 00:20:10,585
- We could add "withholding evidence".
- What are you talking about?

211
00:20:10,668 --> 00:20:14,756
Statements given to you
describing something stalking the city.

212
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:19,094
This is the fishing trip they get me up
at three in the morning for?

213
00:20:19,344 --> 00:20:20,720
Unbelievable!

214
00:20:20,804 --> 00:20:23,973
Why else would you
be sweeping the streets tonight?

215
00:20:24,057 --> 00:20:25,350
You know it's out there.

216
00:20:25,475 --> 00:20:27,519
I got a perpetrator out there.

217
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:32,440
Whether it's Hannibal the Cannibal or
Elmer Fudd, I've got a job to protect people.

218
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:37,445
Is that your job? Or is it to keep
the dice rolling? The tour buses rolling in?

219
00:20:37,529 --> 00:20:42,784
You can't fill those casinos, this town
disappears like a quarter down the slot.

220
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:45,453
I've seen it.

221
00:20:45,537 --> 00:20:47,664
Seen what?

222
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:00,343
<i>(laughs)</i>

223
00:21:00,468 --> 00:21:04,806
You've been spending too much time
in supermarket checkout lines.

224
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:06,975
That story's as old as the hills.

225
00:21:07,058 --> 00:21:11,980
Who's gonna be responsible
when you lose your first tourist, Detective?

226
00:21:12,063 --> 00:21:14,149
- You are.
- No, you are, sir.

227
00:21:14,232 --> 00:21:18,820
Because you're wasting my time
and impeding the solution of this case.

228
00:21:18,903 --> 00:21:21,406
You wanna go on a safari, go to Africa.

229
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:24,659
In the meantime,
enjoy the rest of your weekend.

230
00:21:37,881 --> 00:21:39,549
Agent Scully!

231
00:21:39,674 --> 00:21:41,718
Agent Mulder, line three.

232
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:46,139
Where are you?

233
00:21:46,222 --> 00:21:50,351
- Not far <i>from Where</i> you left me.
- You're still in Atlantic City?

234
00:21:50,435 --> 00:21:53,688
<i>Scully, you got anything
happening this morning?</i>

235
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:57,233
- What's that noise in the background?
- <i>(man vomits)</i>

236
00:21:59,944 --> 00:22:03,907
- That's a <i>guy</i> getting sick.
<i>- Mulder, Where are you?</i>

237
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:06,284
The drunk tank?

238
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:14,876
It's not hard to see
why they mistook you for a vagrant.

239
00:22:16,127 --> 00:22:19,881
Are you gonna rag on me
or take me to get something to eat?

240
00:22:19,964 --> 00:22:22,675
Am <i>1</i> buying? Or did you manage
to panhandle some change

241
00:22:22,759 --> 00:22:24,802
while you were at it?

242
00:22:24,928 --> 00:22:27,430
It moved like a cat. Quick and graceful.

243
00:22:27,555 --> 00:22:31,684
There's no way a human could've
gotten up on the roof that fast.

244
00:22:31,768 --> 00:22:33,853
- Mulder...
- What?

245
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:36,481
What happens when word
gets to the Bureau?

246
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:39,651
They dropped the charges.
Thompson did it to spite me.

247
00:22:39,776 --> 00:22:44,572
- I'm talking about this Jersey Devil.
- It's exactly like the ranger described.

248
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:47,116
The way it moved, sniffed the air...

249
00:22:47,242 --> 00:22:50,453
- It's probably in search of food.
- Yeah, I'll say!

250
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:54,499
It was in the garbage. If it was a man-eater,
why didn't it go for me?

251
00:22:54,624 --> 00:22:59,921
- It probably felt threatened.
- You've already given it a motive and alibi.

252
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:03,800
It chewed somebody's arm off.
Hardly a defensive posture.

253
00:23:03,925 --> 00:23:08,555
- You do believe I saw something?
- You saw something, I'll give you that.

254
00:23:08,638 --> 00:23:12,225
But I'm not about to go in and sell
a sighting in a dark alley.

255
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:17,689
- I've still got a hotel room I'm paying for.
- I have to get back to Washington by 7.30.

256
00:23:17,814 --> 00:23:20,942
- Got another birthday party?
- No.

257
00:23:21,818 --> 00:23:23,861
I have a date.

258
00:23:27,156 --> 00:23:29,284
Can you cancel?

259
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:34,163
Unlike you, Mulder...
I would like to have a life.

260
00:23:34,497 --> 00:23:36,541
I have a life.

261
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:43,506
Come on. I have somebody
I want you to meet on the way home.

262
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:49,512
Just about every culture has one.
Yeti, Sasquatch...

263
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:51,639
...Russian almas, sonnequat.

264
00:23:51,723 --> 00:23:54,684
- Why is that?
- It's a universal wild-man myth.

265
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:59,897
A fear of our dual natures as humans,
as creators of life and destroyers of life.

266
00:24:00,023 --> 00:24:03,776
- What's this chart?
- It shows the historic entry of man...

267
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:07,739
...onto each continent,
and the effect on other species...

268
00:24:07,864 --> 00:24:11,034
- ...which, as you see, has been disastrous.
- Why?

269
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:13,703
We humans have retained hereditary traits

270
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:17,081
that have proven
to be extremely destructive.

271
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:20,710
We tend to be tribal,
aggressively territorial...

272
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:24,213
...orientated by selfish sexual
and reproductive drives...

273
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:28,968
...that make co-operation beyond the family
or tribe extremely hard for us.

274
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:31,763
We kill other species in order to survive?

275
00:24:31,888 --> 00:24:34,557
Humans sit at the top of the food chain...

276
00:24:34,682 --> 00:24:37,894
...and we reduce other species'
chances of survival.

277
00:24:38,061 --> 00:24:41,064
I'm glad Dana left here
with more than a degree!

278
00:24:41,189 --> 00:24:44,108
What if something
entered the food chain above us?

279
00:24:44,233 --> 00:24:48,196
It won't happen.
Our intelligence virtually ensures that...

280
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:53,201
...barring the introduction of alien life,
we will live our days as rulers of the world.

281
00:24:53,284 --> 00:24:56,245
But what if, by some fluke of nature...

282
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:59,999
...a human was born who reverted
to its most animal instincts?

283
00:25:00,083 --> 00:25:01,876
A carnivorous Neanderthal.

284
00:25:01,959 --> 00:25:04,587
Wouldn't he be above us on the food chain?

285
00:25:04,712 --> 00:25:09,092
Sure. All he'd have to do is wait
outside any fast-food restaurant...

286
00:25:09,217 --> 00:25:11,678
...and eat us on the way in.

287
00:25:11,761 --> 00:25:15,264
Haven't there been cases
of men raised in the wilderness...

288
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:18,810
...by animals who have no language
and hunt like predators?

289
00:25:18,935 --> 00:25:21,145
Several. But cannibalism is rare.

290
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:25,024
- Even among the lower mammals.
- When faced with extinction?

291
00:25:25,108 --> 00:25:27,527
Maybe in the jungles of New Guinea...

292
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:31,114
It's highly unlikely
that what you're suggesting...

293
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:34,200
...could have survived
in the woods of New Jersey.

294
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:39,288
Highly unlikely, but not outside
the realm of extreme possibility?

295
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:44,627
Well, it would be an amazing discovery.

296
00:26:22,206 --> 00:26:24,917
The hard thing was
when my wife remarried.

297
00:26:25,001 --> 00:26:28,129
I felt very competitive
for my son's attention.

298
00:26:28,212 --> 00:26:30,298
- It was weird.
- I'm sure.

299
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:33,342
I became a superdad
on the weekend with Scott.

300
00:26:33,468 --> 00:26:36,471
I had this unconscious fear
of being replaced.

301
00:26:36,554 --> 00:26:40,391
I had dreams where I was running
over his stepfather with my car.

302
00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:45,980
You'll understand when you have kids.
They change everything.

303
00:26:46,063 --> 00:26:48,357
That's what they say.

304
00:26:50,151 --> 00:26:53,696
Maybe some weekend
we could take the kids to the beach.

305
00:26:55,031 --> 00:26:58,159
- Yeah!
- Great.

306
00:26:58,242 --> 00:27:00,369
Thank you.

307
00:27:01,412 --> 00:27:04,707
Can I ask about the case you're on,
or can't you say?

308
00:27:08,544 --> 00:27:12,048
I don't think it's a case
we should discuss over dinner.

309
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:17,178
I don't suppose you want to hear about the
finer points of estate planning and taxation?

310
00:27:31,567 --> 00:27:33,694
<i>(phone rings)</i>

311
00:27:35,863 --> 00:27:37,365

Oh, yeah. Hi.

314
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:44,956
I found a body out in the woods today,

315
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,625
<i>looks like it's been dead
six to eight months.</i>

316
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:52,004
A long-haired male, missing
the same tooth I found in that rabbit.

317
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:54,757
- Could be your devil.
- Where's the body now?

318
00:27:54,882 --> 00:27:58,010
<i>- With the coroner's office.</i>
- You're sure <i>it was</i> a male?

319
00:27:58,094 --> 00:28:00,096
<i>It had all the plumbing.</i>

320
00:28:00,221 --> 00:28:02,390
Excuse me.

321
00:28:03,641 --> 00:28:05,768
<i>(bleeping)</i>

00:28:06,811 --> 00:28:08,938
I'm sorry.

323
00:28:12,608 --> 00:28:14,735
Excuse me.

00:28:21,158 --> 00:28:24,871

- That's <i>OK.</i> What's <i>up?</i>

327
00:28:24,954 --> 00:28:27,665
I just had an amazing thought.

328
00:28:28,165 --> 00:28:31,669
Maybe it isn't a beast man
we're looking for, after all.

329
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:45,850
If they picked it up, nobody logged the body
on the chart. Isure haven't seen it.

330
00:28:45,975 --> 00:28:48,436
What else would they have done with it?

331
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,771
We may have called you for nothing.

332
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:52,773
They're trying to sweep it under the carpet.

333
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:54,191
Why?

334
00:28:54,317 --> 00:28:59,113
Any publicity, and the streets are crawling
with people who aren't playing crap tables.

335
00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:01,657
Word gets out it's on the loose, forget it.

336
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:04,702
- You said it was a female?
- The body was a male.

337
00:29:04,827 --> 00:29:08,205
There's a chance there was a mate.
We have to find out.

338
00:29:08,331 --> 00:29:11,167
What are the chances of capturing it alive?

339
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:15,004
If it is a primate,
it would have a natural fear of heights.

340
00:29:15,129 --> 00:29:18,341
It would also want to stay close
to its food source.

341
00:29:18,549 --> 00:29:20,718
This thing has no fear of heights.

342
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:24,221
We'll stay together
and start with the lower floors.

343
00:29:24,347 --> 00:29:28,476
- How much time will that dart give us?
- It'll put down a bear for an hour.

344
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,478
If I hit it.

345
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:06,847
- What's a park-ranger vehicle doing here?
- I don't know.

346
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:10,393
Check it out.

347
00:30:12,603 --> 00:30:14,730
Run a check for me.

348
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:37,753
There's something here!

349
00:30:42,550 --> 00:30:45,886
It's blood.
She could be bringing her killing here.

350
00:30:46,804 --> 00:30:48,931
She could be injured.

351
00:30:51,225 --> 00:30:53,728
Roger. Zebra Team in position.

352
00:31:31,932 --> 00:31:34,435
What if it is a female, Scully?

353
00:31:35,978 --> 00:31:38,064
How close is she to you or me?

354
00:31:38,147 --> 00:31:40,232
Does she feel emotion?

355
00:31:40,316 --> 00:31:43,360
Or are her days just spent...
looking for food?

356
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,490
Maybe she spends her day shopping.

357
00:31:49,992 --> 00:31:54,163
Eight million years out of Africa.
We're not all that different.

358
00:31:56,874 --> 00:32:01,629
We've put men into space. Built computers
that work faster than the human mind.

359
00:32:01,712 --> 00:32:06,842
While we overpopulate the world and create
new technologies to kill each other with.

360
00:32:06,967 --> 00:32:09,553
Maybe we're just beasts with big brains.

361
00:32:11,514 --> 00:32:13,599
- <i>(Scully sighs)</i>
- What?

362
00:32:13,682 --> 00:32:17,686
No, I was just... thinking about
my godson's birthday party.

363
00:32:18,854 --> 00:32:22,149
Eight little six-year-old boys
running around.

364
00:32:22,233 --> 00:32:24,193
Talk about primitive behaviour!

365
00:32:24,318 --> 00:32:27,071
Mulder. He's a federal agent.
Ever hear of him?

366
00:32:27,196 --> 00:32:29,240
No.

367
00:32:29,532 --> 00:32:33,410
- What are you doing here?
- I'm a professor of anthropology.

368
00:32:33,536 --> 00:32:36,539
Mulder. That sound familiar?
I know he's here.

369
00:32:36,664 --> 00:32:40,918
Check upstairs, Andrew.
I want this place searched top to bottom.

370
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:52,346
Move! Move!

371
00:33:18,747 --> 00:33:20,791
<i>(Scully)</i> Mulder!

372
00:33:22,209 --> 00:33:24,253
Mulder, where are you?

373
00:36:41,492 --> 00:36:42,826
Mulder?!

374
00:36:44,161 --> 00:36:45,954
<i>(creature grunts)</i>

375
00:36:46,413 --> 00:36:48,457
Scully!

376
00:36:52,002 --> 00:36:54,129
Lay back.

377
00:36:54,463 --> 00:36:56,590
Oh! Mulder, you're hurt!

378
00:36:57,299 --> 00:36:59,385
You should have seen her.

379
00:36:59,468 --> 00:37:01,553
She was beautiful.

380
00:37:01,637 --> 00:37:04,098
She just about ripped your lungs out.

381
00:37:04,807 --> 00:37:09,561
She could have torn my head off, but
she didn't cos she sensed I wasn't a threat.

382
00:37:09,645 --> 00:37:12,898
I need federal jurisdiction on this case.
Mulder!

383
00:37:12,981 --> 00:37:16,944
- How old would you say she was?
- The assistant DA's on the phone.

384
00:37:17,027 --> 00:37:19,321
He wants to know what the hell is going on.

385
00:37:19,405 --> 00:37:22,282
Tell him he's got
a Neanderthal on the loose.

386
00:37:22,366 --> 00:37:25,786
- She was young.
- The Crime Unit has filed a complaint...

387
00:37:25,869 --> 00:37:28,872
...that we're endangering
a murder investigation.

388
00:37:28,997 --> 00:37:32,835
- That is such crap.
- They've got her cornered in a building.

389
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:36,422
It crawled into the wall.

390
00:37:36,505 --> 00:37:38,841
- Can you get a man in there?
- <i>Affirmative.</i>

391
00:37:40,551 --> 00:37:43,679
- Keep these people out of here!
- Take her alive!

392
00:37:43,804 --> 00:37:46,432
- <i>(glass smashing)</i>
- What's going on in there?

393
00:37:46,515 --> 00:37:50,185
<i>I've got a man down! A naked woman
jumped from the second storey!</i>

394
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:53,355
Suspect is headed south
into the woods on foot!

395
00:38:10,247 --> 00:38:13,333
I know these woods.
She'll be down by the rocks.

396
00:38:36,356 --> 00:38:38,400
Look.

397
00:38:41,445 --> 00:38:43,530
Can you reach her from here?

398
00:38:43,614 --> 00:38:45,741
I can try.

399
00:39:19,775 --> 00:39:21,818
<i>(gunshots)</i>

400
00:39:26,949 --> 00:39:29,076
<i>(men shouting)</i>

401
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:38,460
It tried to take my arm off.

402
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:15,664
Why did you have to kill her?

403
00:40:17,833 --> 00:40:20,168
Same reason you kill a rabid animal.

404
00:41:02,210 --> 00:41:04,296
Hi. This just came through.

405
00:41:04,379 --> 00:41:07,716
It's a posthumous medical exam
of the woman's body.

406
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:12,095
They found fragments of human bones
still in her digestive tract.

407
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,890
They estimated her age to be 25 to 30 years.

408
00:41:15,015 --> 00:41:19,519
Now, they allowed Dr Diamond
to do a medical exam of the body...

409
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:24,983
...but he found nothing that suggested
prehistoric bone structure or physiology.

410
00:41:25,067 --> 00:41:27,694
Now, the ACPD has her listed as 3 Jane Doe.

411
00:41:27,778 --> 00:41:32,699
A search for her identity in state
psychiatric records has begun in earnest.

412
00:41:32,783 --> 00:41:33,950
Good luck.

413
00:41:34,034 --> 00:41:36,536
They have also released the medical exam...

414
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:39,039
...from the male body that they found.

415
00:41:39,122 --> 00:41:41,750
His age is estimated to be about 40 years.

416
00:41:42,751 --> 00:41:44,920
There would have been offspring.

417
00:41:45,087 --> 00:41:50,425
The medical exam of the woman's uterus
does indicate that she may have given birth.

418
00:41:50,550 --> 00:41:54,471
She was just protecting her children.
It all makes sense.

419
00:41:54,596 --> 00:41:57,683
The male dies
and she comes out in search of food.

420
00:41:57,766 --> 00:42:01,186
Mulder, do me a favour.
Go and have a beer. Take the day off.

421
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:04,398
I'll cover for you.
Just take some time for yourself.

422
00:42:04,481 --> 00:42:06,983
I've got an appointment
at the Smithsonian...

423
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:10,278
- ...with an ethno-biologist.
- <i>(phone rings)</i>

424
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:13,573
Mulder.

425
00:42:13,657 --> 00:42:17,160
Yeah, just a second. It's for you.

426
00:42:20,997 --> 00:42:23,834
- Hello?
- <i>Hi, Dana. It's Rob.</i>

427
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:25,335
Oh, hi.

428
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:29,172
Sorry to call you at work,
but I have Scott for the night...

429
00:42:29,297 --> 00:42:34,594
...and we have tickets for <i>Cirque</i> de Soleil.
We thought you and Trent could join us.

430
00:42:40,016 --> 00:42:42,519
Requisition for a car, please.

431
00:42:43,145 --> 00:42:45,647
Thank you.

432
00:42:51,528 --> 00:42:53,613
Who was that on the phone?

433
00:42:53,697 --> 00:42:55,782
- A guy.
- A guy?

434
00:42:55,866 --> 00:42:58,076
Same guy you had dinner with?

435
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:01,496
- Same guy.
- Are you gonna have dinner with him again?

436
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:03,665
- I don't think so.
- No interest?

437
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:06,334
- Not at this time.
- Thanks, Fran.

438
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:11,840
- What are you doing?
- Going with you to the Smithsonian.

439
00:43:11,965 --> 00:43:16,344
- Don't you have a life, Scully?
- I'll hurt you like that beast woman.

440
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:18,680
Eight million years out of Africa.

441
00:43:18,805 --> 00:43:20,849
And look who's holding the door.

442
00:43:30,025 --> 00:43:32,736
- Dad, did you just see something?
- Where?

443
00:43:32,861 --> 00:43:35,322
- Over there.
- I'm sure it was nothing.

444
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:39,451
- No, I saw something.
- Ever hear the story of the Jersey Devil?

445
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:42,662
When I was a kid,
my dad used to tell this story...

446
00:43:42,746 --> 00:43:45,707
...about a creature
who lived out in the woods.

447
00:43:45,832 --> 00:43:47,876
It was half-man, half-animal.

448
00:43:48,001 --> 00:43:50,045
I used to believe that story.

449
00:44:09,898 --> 00:44:11,399
Visiontext subtitles: Sally Lewis

450
00:44:22,035 --> 00:44:23,912
