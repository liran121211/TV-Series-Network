1
00:01:31,176 --> 00:01:35,847
Southern Crescent to Red Crescent.
We got a downed plane at camp perimeter.

2
00:01:35,931 --> 00:01:38,934
<i>We have nothing in the sky at this time.</i>

3
00:01:39,017 --> 00:01:42,437
We got something down here.
We're gonna check it out.

4
00:01:46,275 --> 00:01:48,902
<i>Medevac One, this is Red Crescent.</i>

5
00:01:48,986 --> 00:01:53,407
<i>Southern Crescent</i>
<i>reports a downed aircraft in their area.</i>

6
00:02:54,217 --> 00:02:57,721
<i>It's the Grand Ole Opry</i>
<i>on WSM Radio 650.</i>

7
00:02:57,804 --> 00:03:00,349
<i>Brought to you by</i>
<i>Goody's Headache Powder.</i>

8
00:03:00,515 --> 00:03:04,770
<i>When the night's been too long</i>
<i>and the party's been too hearty...</i>

9
00:03:04,853 --> 00:03:10,776
<i>.. Goody's Headache Powder straightens</i>
<i>you right out. You have my word on that.</i>

10
00:03:19,326 --> 00:03:23,372
<i>It was cigar-shaped,</i>
<i>red and green lights. Fast as hell!</i>

11
00:03:23,455 --> 00:03:26,541
<i>I seen three of 'em</i>
<i>fly over Chester County.</i>

12
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:29,586
<i>Six troopers</i>
<i>were chasing 'em down 22.</i>

13
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:34,174
<i>I see one now!</i>
<i>It's over the water tower!</i>

14
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:36,343
<i>I see it, too!</i>

15
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:54,754
From the trucker's description, the shape
he fired at could have been a mountain lion.

16
00:04:54,838 --> 00:04:55,964
Conceivably.

17
00:04:56,047 --> 00:04:59,134
The National Weather Service
last night reported...

18
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:02,429
...atmospheric conditions in this area...

19
00:05:02,512 --> 00:05:04,473
...possibly conducive to lightning.

20
00:05:04,556 --> 00:05:05,599
Possibly.

21
00:05:12,022 --> 00:05:15,400
It <i>is</i> feasible
that the truck was struck by lightning...

22
00:05:15,484 --> 00:05:17,736
...creating the electrical failure.

23
00:05:17,819 --> 00:05:19,905
It's feasible.

24
00:05:19,988 --> 00:05:22,824
And you know, there's a marsh over there.

25
00:05:23,867 --> 00:05:28,246
Those lights the driver saw
<i>may</i> have been swamp gas.

26
00:05:28,997 --> 00:05:31,958
- Swamp gas?
- It's a natural phenomenon.

27
00:05:32,042 --> 00:05:36,796
Phosphine and methane rising
from decaying organic matter ignite...

28
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,174
...creating globes of blue flame.

29
00:05:39,257 --> 00:05:42,052
Happens to me when I eat Dodger Dogs.

30
00:05:42,552 --> 00:05:46,598
How can a dozen witnesses,
including a squad of police vehicles...

31
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:48,850
...become hysterical over swamp gas?

32
00:05:48,934 --> 00:05:51,311
I've investigated multiple sightings.

33
00:05:51,394 --> 00:05:54,898
Chesapeake Bay, the Okobogee Lake,
Area 51 in Nevada.

34
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:57,234
None had this much supporting evidence.

35
00:05:57,317 --> 00:06:02,072
Anecdotal data, exhaust residue,
radiation levels five times the norm.

36
00:06:02,155 --> 00:06:04,616
None of that evidence is conclusive.

37
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:07,827
The question is,
why was the truck driver singled out?

38
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:09,996
Isn't it more plausible...

39
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,127
...that an exhausted driver got swept up in
the hysteria and fired upon hallucinations?

40
00:06:16,211 --> 00:06:18,880
After all, the road <i>can</i> play tricks on you.

41
00:06:18,964 --> 00:06:21,049
Yeah, it can play tricks on you.

42
00:06:22,592 --> 00:06:24,678
But not like this.

43
00:06:25,929 --> 00:06:28,890
I started these stopwatches
at the same time.

44
00:06:30,392 --> 00:06:32,727
I don't know why they're holding me.

45
00:06:33,645 --> 00:06:38,149
This "firing a weapon on a county road"
charge is a lot o' horse manure.

46
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:41,486
I'm a vet, and I know how to handle a gun.

47
00:06:41,570 --> 00:06:43,655
Mr Ranheim...

48
00:06:43,738 --> 00:06:48,243
...can you elaborate on the report you filed
last night regarding your encounter?

49
00:06:48,326 --> 00:06:50,412
It was round.

50
00:06:52,664 --> 00:06:54,749
Like a saucer.

51
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:57,711
And... green and orange lights.

52
00:06:57,794 --> 00:07:00,714
Last night you said it was
cigar-shaped and black.

53
00:07:00,797 --> 00:07:02,882
I didn't ask for this to happen.

54
00:07:07,137 --> 00:07:12,017
All I want is to deliver my shipment
of auto parts and forget...

55
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:21,735
Pardon me for asking...

56
00:07:21,818 --> 00:07:24,321
...but how long have you had that cough?

57
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:29,618
Why?

58
00:07:29,701 --> 00:07:32,412
I'm just concerned.
You said you were a veteran.

59
00:07:33,413 --> 00:07:37,626
- What's that got to do with this?
- The cough, the fever, the rash.

60
00:07:37,709 --> 00:07:39,961
Those are symptoms of Gulf War Syndrome.

61
00:07:40,045 --> 00:07:45,842
- I was never in the Gulf War.
- So, how long have you not been yourself?

62
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:53,058
Since the thing last night.

63
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:59,105
Mr Ranheim? I'm Police Chief Rivers.

64
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:03,943
Please, forgive the misunderstanding.
Your truck's been squared away. You may go.

65
00:08:04,027 --> 00:08:07,113
- I'd like to examine the truck.
- That won't be necessary.

66
00:08:07,197 --> 00:08:11,242
He had an alleged close encounter.
The truck will contain evidence.

67
00:08:11,326 --> 00:08:14,704
- If I may...
- You've gotten all you're gonna get.

68
00:08:14,788 --> 00:08:18,291
- We won't cooperate in your investigation.
- Why?

69
00:08:19,376 --> 00:08:22,045
Just... go away.

70
00:08:28,635 --> 00:08:30,720
Not... Not here.

71
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:48,822
Someone got to the police chief.
Ranheim was hiding something.

72
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:51,658
- Ranheim was sick.
- He became sick last night.

73
00:08:51,741 --> 00:08:53,827
Excuse me, could I use your pen?

74
00:08:55,286 --> 00:08:58,164
You think Gulf War Syndrome
is caused by UFOs?

75
00:08:58,248 --> 00:09:01,501
UFOs are often witnessed by soldiers
during wartime.

76
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:04,921
Thanks.

77
00:09:05,004 --> 00:09:11,219
Mulder, the only UFOs that soldiers are
likely to see are secret military aircraft.

78
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:17,183
That's what soldiers in Iraq said. The exhaust
or fuel of a classified aircraft or its weapon.

79
00:09:19,477 --> 00:09:23,982
There <i>is</i> a base in Little Rock. You think
that's what the Air Force was flying?

80
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:29,112
They'd deny it. But it could possibly explain
how Ranheim developed the symptoms.

81
00:09:29,195 --> 00:09:30,864
Possibly.

82
00:09:30,947 --> 00:09:34,075
I'll talk to some people
when we get to Washington.

83
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,120
The military won't discuss
classified aircraft.

84
00:09:37,203 --> 00:09:42,000
They're a government watchdog group.
They publish <i>The Lone Gunman</i> magazine.

85
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:45,962
They have information on
covert actions, classified weapons.

86
00:09:46,045 --> 00:09:48,757
Some of their ideas are downright spooky.

87
00:09:49,674 --> 00:09:52,719
Check it out, Mulder.

88
00:09:52,802 --> 00:09:55,764
- I met the guy who shot John F Kennedy.
- Is that so?

89
00:09:55,847 --> 00:09:59,768
Old dude now, but yeah. Says he was
dressed as a cop on the grassy knoll.

90
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:05,398
Mulder, listen to this. Vladimir Zhirinovsky,
leader of the Russian Social Democrats?

91
00:10:05,482 --> 00:10:08,902
He's being put in power by
the most evil force of the century.

92
00:10:08,985 --> 00:10:11,070
Barney?

93
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:14,616
- The CIA.
- Hm?

94
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:17,160
Is this your sceptical partner?

95
00:10:18,411 --> 00:10:20,497
She's hot.

96
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,876
The CIA, threatened by a loss of power
since the collapse of the Cold War...

97
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,629
...wouldn't dream of having
the old enemy back?

98
00:10:27,712 --> 00:10:31,049
- You give the government too much credit.

99
00:10:32,509 --> 00:10:36,971
- The government can't control a deficit...
<i>- Lone Gunman.</i>

100
00:10:37,055 --> 00:10:40,141
What makes you think they can
plan an elaborate conspiracy?

101
00:10:40,225 --> 00:10:42,894
- She <i>is</i> hot.
- Settle down, Frohike.

102
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:46,731
We're not talking about
a bunch of idiots up on the hill.

103
00:10:46,815 --> 00:10:51,820
We're talking about a government within
a government, controlling our every move.

104
00:10:51,903 --> 00:10:55,657
- How can they do that?
- How? I'll show you how. You got a $20 bill?

105
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,201
Hmm...

106
00:10:58,284 --> 00:10:59,953
I'll check.

107
00:11:00,036 --> 00:11:02,121
Mm-hm.

108
00:11:08,586 --> 00:11:10,672
Hey!

109
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:19,681
That's just one method.
They use this magnetic strip to track you.

110
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:25,478
You pass through an airport metal detector
and they know exactly what you're carrying.

111
00:11:25,562 --> 00:11:30,024
- It is a federal crime to deface money.
- The strip is an anti-counterfeiting measure.

112
00:11:30,108 --> 00:11:32,819
Other countries put that strip
on the outside.

113
00:11:32,902 --> 00:11:37,115
OK! All right. What do you know
about the Gulf War Syndrome?

114
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:40,994
- Agent Orange of the '90s.
- Artillery shells made with depleted uranium.

115
00:11:41,077 --> 00:11:45,373
Have you heard of classified planes
being flown during the Persian Gulf War?

116
00:11:45,456 --> 00:11:50,253
Why expose a secret plane to an air force that
runs to Iran whenever you take to the air?

117
00:11:50,336 --> 00:11:53,673
What about UFO activity during that period?

118
00:11:53,756 --> 00:11:56,593
UFOs caused Gulf War Syndrome!
That's a good one!

119
00:11:56,676 --> 00:11:59,637
Mulder, your ideas are weirder than ours!

120
00:12:02,265 --> 00:12:05,602
Those were the most paranoid people
I have ever met.

121
00:12:05,685 --> 00:12:09,022
How can you think that
what they say is <i>remotely</i> plausible?

122
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:12,859
It's remotely plausible
that someone might think you're hot.

123
00:12:17,614 --> 00:12:20,742
Did you see the way
they answered the telephone?

124
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:27,749
They probably think every call they get is
monitored and they're followed everywhere.

125
00:12:27,832 --> 00:12:32,712
It's a form of self-delusion. Makes them
think that what they do is important...

126
00:12:36,257 --> 00:12:38,843
What's the matter?

127
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:46,995
- Hello?

128
00:14:03,928 --> 00:14:07,890
Pitchers and catchers
report for spring training this week.

129
00:14:08,349 --> 00:14:10,768
Yeah. What are we doing here?!

130
00:14:11,978 --> 00:14:14,605
Missed your calling, did you, Mr Mulder?

131
00:14:16,024 --> 00:14:19,527
Maybe this year
we can catch a game at Candleton Yards.

132
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:23,865
Of course,
we wouldn't be able to sit together.

133
00:14:23,948 --> 00:14:28,953
That's too bad. Something tells me you'd
have the connections to get great seats.

134
00:14:29,037 --> 00:14:30,246
Yeah...

135
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:32,290
Any park in the country.

136
00:14:35,543 --> 00:14:38,004
It's just a tourist.

137
00:14:38,171 --> 00:14:42,300
In our line, nothing is <i>just</i> what it seems.

138
00:14:43,509 --> 00:14:48,014
What am I on to? We go to investigate
a truck driver's encounter with a UFO.

139
00:14:48,097 --> 00:14:52,935
Next thing, we discover electronic
surveillance equipment. Who's listening?

140
00:14:55,646 --> 00:14:57,607
Why won't you tell me?

141
00:15:08,576 --> 00:15:10,244
What am I on to?

142
00:15:12,705 --> 00:15:14,791
A dangerous path.

143
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:46,781
The truck is bogus.
So's the truck driver, Ranheim.

144
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:48,950
First, I checked his manifest.

145
00:15:49,033 --> 00:15:53,913
It listed a truck carrying 108 cartons
of auto parts weighing 3100 pounds.

146
00:15:53,996 --> 00:15:59,127
I checked with three weigh stations along
his route. They have it listed at 5100 pounds.

147
00:15:59,210 --> 00:16:02,547
There's something in that truck,
and it's not auto parts.

148
00:16:02,630 --> 00:16:05,383
And, of course, nobody ever reported him.

149
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:08,177
And Ranheim lied to us
about being in the Gulf War.

150
00:16:08,261 --> 00:16:10,721
His real name is Frank Druce.

151
00:16:10,805 --> 00:16:13,099
And I worked hard to get this one.

152
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:17,103
He was Special Operations Black Beret
in Mosul, Northern Iraq.

153
00:16:17,186 --> 00:16:20,857
Also, he didn't get sick
from the encounter the other night.

154
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,236
He's been to the VA hospital for treatments
three times in the past year.

155
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:26,487
We had it!

156
00:16:26,571 --> 00:16:29,031
We had it and we let it go.

157
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,747
Four days ago,
an Iraqi Air Force pilot shot down a UFO.

158
00:16:36,831 --> 00:16:41,169
The wreckage, and possibly the occupants,
were recovered by the Army.

159
00:16:41,252 --> 00:16:43,671
Ranheim would be a perfect escort...

160
00:16:43,754 --> 00:16:49,135
...for the wreckage, and/or bodies, out of Iraq
to a laboratory in the United States.

161
00:16:49,218 --> 00:16:53,306
That would explain why the truck
weighed so much more than listed.

162
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:55,474
The military has, in the past...

163
00:16:55,558 --> 00:17:00,396
...transported dangerous materials and
weapons in unmarked trucks across the US.

164
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:04,650
- I sound like the <i>The Lone Gunman</i> guys.
- Where did you get this information?

165
00:17:04,734 --> 00:17:08,154
Let's just say
it's a source with a deep background.

166
00:17:10,615 --> 00:17:12,700
I want to know all about him.

167
00:17:12,783 --> 00:17:15,369
All I know is,
he's guided us away from harm.

168
00:17:15,453 --> 00:17:17,538
How do you know that?

169
00:17:17,622 --> 00:17:21,125
We work for the FBI and we're being bugged.
What does that tell you?

170
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:24,503
That tells me that not everything
is as it appears to be.

171
00:17:24,587 --> 00:17:29,550
Exactly! And for all we know, this deep
background is responsible for the bug.

172
00:17:29,634 --> 00:17:31,719
He's never lied to me.

173
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:34,513
I won't break that confidence. I trust him.

174
00:17:34,597 --> 00:17:37,099
Mulder, you're the only one I trust.

175
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:41,145
Then you're gonna have to trust me.

176
00:17:42,355 --> 00:17:45,524
Did you find out where the truck is now?

177
00:17:45,608 --> 00:17:47,693
Generally. It's heading west.

178
00:17:47,777 --> 00:17:49,862
Towards Colorado.

179
00:17:49,946 --> 00:17:52,907
We'll try to intercept it
and see what's on board.

180
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:57,703
I'll pick up a few things.
I'll meet you at your place in an hour. OK?

181
00:18:14,637 --> 00:18:16,764
I cut the main breaker.

182
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:29,777
- You risk exposure coming here.
- What I have here is too important.

183
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:35,449
This photograph was taken
by an officer at Fort Benning, Georgia.

184
00:18:35,533 --> 00:18:38,703
Seventeen UFOs were spotted in one hour.

185
00:18:38,786 --> 00:18:41,831
Is that where the Iraqi wreckage
is being held?

186
00:18:41,914 --> 00:18:44,000
Are UFOs monitoring the area?

187
00:18:45,668 --> 00:18:47,753
Nice place you have here.

188
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:56,429
Wait. Wait... I-I... just want to...
take this opportunity to thank you.

189
00:18:56,512 --> 00:19:00,683
You've helped my work so much,
and you've never asked for anything in return.

190
00:19:00,766 --> 00:19:03,269
I know you've put yourself
at great risk to do so.

191
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:35,509
This is the best photographic evidence
I have ever seen.

192
00:19:35,593 --> 00:19:38,554
When I saw the Gulf Breeze photos,
I knew they were a hoax.

193
00:19:38,637 --> 00:19:42,433
But this is the quality of evidence
the government has amassed...

194
00:19:42,516 --> 00:19:45,311
...at the highest classified levels.

195
00:19:45,394 --> 00:19:49,023
The truck was a decoy
to keep anyone looking closely...

196
00:19:49,106 --> 00:19:51,901
...away from Fort Benning,
where the Iraqi UFO is.

197
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:55,988
- We've got to leave for Georgia immediately.
- This photo is a fake.

198
00:19:56,072 --> 00:19:57,156
What?

199
00:19:57,239 --> 00:19:59,325
Look.

200
00:20:00,701 --> 00:20:04,538
This soldier's shadow is allegedly created
by the lights from the UFO.

201
00:20:04,622 --> 00:20:08,292
But it falls in a direction
contradictory to the craft's position.

202
00:20:08,376 --> 00:20:12,296
There could be an off-camera light source
creating that shadow.

203
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:16,258
Look closely at the colour of the light
reflected in the windshield.

204
00:20:16,342 --> 00:20:21,847
It <i>should</i> be from the red lights of the UFO,
but it doesn't match the colour.

205
00:20:21,931 --> 00:20:26,477
There could be a tint in the windshield, or
it could be due to atmospheric conditions.

206
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:30,564
- Mulder, we should have it analysed.
- You're determined not to believe him!

207
00:20:30,648 --> 00:20:32,817
You're <i>too</i> determined to believe him!

208
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,985
I am determined to follow a lead...

209
00:20:35,069 --> 00:20:39,407
...that may prove the existence
of extraterrestrial biological entities.

210
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,741
- Listen...
- No!

211
00:20:40,825 --> 00:20:42,743
Will you just hear me?!

212
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:49,417
I have never met anyone so passionate
and dedicated to a belief as you.

213
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,878
It's so intense that sometimes it's blinding.

214
00:20:52,962 --> 00:20:57,550
But there are others who are watching you,
who know what I know, and...

215
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:02,972
...whereas I can respect and admire
your passion, they will use it against you.

216
00:21:05,057 --> 00:21:07,143
Mulder, the truth <i>is</i> out there.

217
00:21:07,768 --> 00:21:09,854
But so are lies.

218
00:21:11,647 --> 00:21:13,732
Thank you.

219
00:22:06,619 --> 00:22:11,081
I had the photo analysed by the Bureau's
computers. It <i>appears</i> to be legitimate.

220
00:22:11,165 --> 00:22:16,378
The photo-grain matches the pattern
and density... the colour level, shading...

221
00:22:16,462 --> 00:22:20,257
Then I noticed this.
It's the moon, half full.

222
00:22:20,341 --> 00:22:25,471
I had the reflection in this window
enlarged by 25. There's the moon again.

223
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:27,640
A quarter full.

224
00:22:27,723 --> 00:22:31,477
The window couldn't catch
the moon's reflection from that angle.

225
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,772
You were right, Scully. It's a fake.

226
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:36,941
He tried to deceive us.

227
00:22:37,233 --> 00:22:39,318
Now we're alone on this.

228
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:42,488
There's no one we can trust.

229
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:46,283
They went to a lot of trouble
to put us on the wrong track.

230
00:22:46,367 --> 00:22:50,037
There's something here
that no one's supposed to find.

231
00:23:04,802 --> 00:23:07,596
Why didn't you leave for Fort Benning?

232
00:23:07,972 --> 00:23:10,099
The photograph was a fake.

233
00:23:11,308 --> 00:23:15,813
At least you're not insulting me further
by feigning appalled surprise.

234
00:23:15,896 --> 00:23:20,734
On the contrary, I think a compliment is in
order. That photo was prepared by the best.

235
00:23:20,818 --> 00:23:23,153
- I thought you were my ally.
- I am.

236
00:23:23,237 --> 00:23:27,408
Imagine if Eisenhower told the Allies
that D-day would happen in Belgium.

237
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:31,328
Mr Mulder, I place my life in great jeopardy
every time we speak!

238
00:23:35,165 --> 00:23:38,669
I've been a participant
in some of the most insidious lies...

239
00:23:38,794 --> 00:23:42,006
...and witness to deeds
that no crazed man could imagine.

240
00:23:42,089 --> 00:23:46,927
I've spent years watching you
from my, uh... lofty position...

241
00:23:47,011 --> 00:23:50,014
...to know that
you were the one I could trust.

242
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:53,350
- Then why did you lie to me?
- I needed to divert you.

243
00:23:54,351 --> 00:23:59,023
You and Scully are excellent investigators,
and your motives are just.

244
00:23:59,148 --> 00:24:03,444
However, there still exist some secrets
which should remain secret.

245
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:06,697
Truths that people are just not ready to know.

246
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:09,199
Who are you to decide that for me?

247
00:24:10,034 --> 00:24:14,121
The world's reaction to such knowledge
would be <i>far</i> too dangerous.

248
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:18,042
Dangerous?
You mean, in the sense of outrage?

249
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:21,545
Like the reaction to
the Kennedy assassination, or MIAs...

250
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:25,382
...or radiation experiments
on terminal patients. Watergate...

251
00:24:25,466 --> 00:24:29,887
...Iran Contra, Roswell, the Tuskegee
experiments... Where will it end?!

252
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:37,311
I guess it won't end, as long as
men like you decide what is truth.

253
00:24:39,063 --> 00:24:44,568
That transcript you gave me of the Iraqi file -
that was the truth, wasn't it?

254
00:24:44,693 --> 00:24:47,196
Why did you even bother to show it to me?

255
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:50,741
Well, I was aware that
you were on to the truck.

256
00:24:50,866 --> 00:24:54,495
So I knew that down the road
I would have to steer you away...

257
00:24:54,578 --> 00:24:56,664
...that I would have to lie to you.

258
00:24:56,747 --> 00:25:01,752
And a lie, Mr Mulder, is most convincingly
hidden between two truths.

259
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:07,508
Mulder!

260
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:11,011
If the shark stops swimming, it will die.

261
00:25:14,515 --> 00:25:16,600
Don't stop swimming.

262
00:25:18,435 --> 00:25:21,855
I'm not responsible
for the electronic surveillance...

263
00:25:21,939 --> 00:25:24,274
...but I do know they can still hear you.

264
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:54,698
Mulder!

265
00:26:56,158 --> 00:26:58,535
Are you home?

266
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:04,041
Scully. Hey, I'm glad you dropped by.

267
00:27:04,124 --> 00:27:06,877
I've been thinking about
this whole situation.

268
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,173
I think you're right. I think they won this one
and we should just move on.

269
00:27:32,861 --> 00:27:35,405
I think this time you're right, Mulder.

270
00:27:59,888 --> 00:28:02,391
All right, stick with him.

271
00:28:34,631 --> 00:28:36,717
Hey!

272
00:28:43,265 --> 00:28:47,477
Here you are. A round trip to Chicago.
Here's your credit card.

273
00:28:47,603 --> 00:28:50,147
And the plane departs at Gate 35.

274
00:28:50,272 --> 00:28:54,151
I'd also like a one-way ticket to Los Angeles,
with a stop in Las Vegas.

275
00:28:54,276 --> 00:28:56,153
And for that I'll be paying cash.

276
00:30:15,816 --> 00:30:19,736
I called every weigh station and
Bureau office west of Colorado.

277
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:23,490
I tied up an air phone for three hours.
I don't speak Japanese...

278
00:30:23,573 --> 00:30:27,744
...but I think a man told me to
stick some sushi where the sun don't shine!

279
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:31,832
My ear's numb from being on hold for hours.

280
00:30:31,915 --> 00:30:34,918
At least we can be sure
they didn't trace our call.

281
00:30:35,002 --> 00:30:37,838
I couldn't find the truck.
Did you have any luck?

282
00:30:37,921 --> 00:30:40,465
Yup. It's heading northwest on I-90.

283
00:30:40,549 --> 00:30:43,427
<i>We have to get a couple of tickets to Seattle.</i>

284
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,184
Think about it.

285
00:30:51,268 --> 00:30:53,937
This truck drove across America.
People have passed it on the road.

286
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:59,359
Probably thought it was hauling auto parts
or furniture, livestock, whatever...

287
00:30:59,443 --> 00:31:04,031
Nobody would have suspected
it was hauling a craft from another world.

288
00:31:04,114 --> 00:31:05,907
Here we go.

289
00:31:41,651 --> 00:31:44,905
Mulder, we've been following
this truck for hours.

290
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:46,239
Mm.

291
00:31:46,323 --> 00:31:50,243
Maybe he knows we're following him
and he's taking an evasive route.

292
00:31:50,327 --> 00:31:52,579
If that were the case...

293
00:32:13,683 --> 00:32:16,186
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

294
00:32:29,324 --> 00:32:31,743
Ranheim!

295
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:34,663
Ranheim?!

296
00:33:11,950 --> 00:33:14,035
Scully!

297
00:33:17,956 --> 00:33:19,416
Oh, my God!

298
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:23,211
It was an extraterrestrial
biological entity - alive.

299
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,589
Where did it go?

300
00:33:27,716 --> 00:33:30,260
I think we were just witness
to a rescue mission.

301
00:33:50,572 --> 00:33:52,991
God, Mulder, I can't stop shaking.

302
00:33:53,825 --> 00:33:56,745
What just happened - does it fit the profile?

303
00:33:57,287 --> 00:33:59,623
You're asking me if it was real?

304
00:33:59,831 --> 00:34:02,125
Did we just have a close encounter?

305
00:34:07,088 --> 00:34:09,174
No. It was another hoax.

306
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:15,847
But how could anyone generate such force?

307
00:34:16,681 --> 00:34:19,476
Whatever they used,
we probably haven't heard of it.

308
00:34:19,851 --> 00:34:23,813
Sound weapons... Stealth helicopter
with an ultra-high intensity light...

309
00:34:24,064 --> 00:34:26,983
There's no evidence that this was a UFO.

310
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,487
So they created this elaborate show
just to deflect us again.

311
00:34:31,112 --> 00:34:33,823
Wouldn't it have been easier for them just...

312
00:34:34,115 --> 00:34:37,285
Just to kill us.
Yeah, I've wondered that myself.

313
00:34:38,078 --> 00:34:41,998
But maybe they're using me against myself,
like you said before.

314
00:34:42,165 --> 00:34:47,504
That I want so badly to believe that I accept
the obvious conclusions and walk away.

315
00:34:51,174 --> 00:34:53,426
Now we have nothing to go on.

316
00:34:55,845 --> 00:34:57,222
No one to turn to.

317
00:34:57,305 --> 00:35:00,767
There's still one player in all this
who hasn't lied to us.

318
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:03,353
But it's not quite someone we can turn to.

319
00:35:03,436 --> 00:35:05,939
Leverlay and Priest Rapids?

320
00:35:06,690 --> 00:35:08,733
East bank of the Columbia River.

321
00:35:10,151 --> 00:35:11,945
Did you send out a field investigator?

322
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:15,282
And you can substantiate the sighting?

323
00:35:16,032 --> 00:35:17,701
OK, Nick, thanks a lot.

324
00:35:18,994 --> 00:35:23,707
I've contacted several organisations
that have hotlines for UFO reports.

325
00:35:24,416 --> 00:35:26,543
The Center for UFO Studies in Chicago...

326
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:31,423
...MUFON, NICAP. None of them have ever
reported a week of such activity.

327
00:35:31,506 --> 00:35:34,759
It began in Tennessee,
where Ranheim was encountered.

328
00:35:34,843 --> 00:35:37,762
The sightings follow the path of the truck.

329
00:35:37,846 --> 00:35:39,931
And after last night's hoax...

330
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:41,808
Look at this.

331
00:35:42,892 --> 00:35:45,603
Seven sightings in Mattawa, Washington.

332
00:35:45,687 --> 00:35:48,315
- That's 100 miles away.
- Aliens?

333
00:35:48,398 --> 00:35:50,483
Looks like they want their colleague back.

334
00:35:55,196 --> 00:35:58,366
We've driven full circle
through Mattawa twice.

335
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:00,535
There's nothing here.

336
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,665
What's over there?

337
00:36:26,770 --> 00:36:28,521
That's an intergalactic space greeting.

338
00:36:29,147 --> 00:36:31,649
- It means "Hello, space brothers."
<i>- </i> Good.

339
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:34,110
- What's going on here?
- A UFO party.

340
00:36:34,235 --> 00:36:38,365
- You've seen UFOs?
- Last two nights. They're drawn to electricity.

341
00:36:38,448 --> 00:36:41,242
They hover over the power plant down there.

342
00:36:57,092 --> 00:36:59,427
This is it. There's Ranheim.

343
00:37:05,892 --> 00:37:09,562
This place has got to have
the highest level of security.

344
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:11,898
It's just the kind of challenge
they're looking for.

345
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:14,275
Who?

346
00:37:22,492 --> 00:37:25,912
<i>- Lone Gunman.</i>
- It's Mulder. Turn the tape recorder off.

347
00:37:27,914 --> 00:37:29,999
- OK. It's off.
- Turn it off!

348
00:37:30,083 --> 00:37:31,584
It's off already!

349
00:37:31,876 --> 00:37:33,586
How would you like to have...

350
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:37,924
...the first substantiated photo of
an extraterrestrial biological entity?

351
00:37:38,591 --> 00:37:41,803
No way! An EBE?!
What do we have to do?

352
00:37:41,886 --> 00:37:44,055
Hack me some identification numbers.

353
00:37:49,769 --> 00:37:52,063
Braidwood and Stefoff.

354
00:37:55,108 --> 00:37:56,568
Personal ID number?

355
00:37:56,651 --> 00:37:58,153
7-5-9-3.

356
00:37:58,236 --> 00:37:59,779
5-3-1-1.

357
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:02,532
Open the trunk, please.

358
00:38:16,087 --> 00:38:18,173
Park in lot 4.

359
00:38:19,632 --> 00:38:21,050
Thanks.

360
00:38:29,392 --> 00:38:31,478
Hey, wait!

361
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,648
Display these at all times.

362
00:38:36,774 --> 00:38:38,193
Proceed.

363
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:58,463
Langly said he couldn't gain access
to Level 6, so that's...

364
00:39:14,854 --> 00:39:18,525
- We have to go back to get through that door.
- We'll look suspicious.

365
00:39:18,608 --> 00:39:22,862
- We have to find another access, then.
- Mulder, they're not gonna let us!

366
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,409
- Could you folks come with me, please?
- We're lost...

367
00:39:28,493 --> 00:39:30,745
- Just proceed down the hallway.
- If you...

368
00:39:30,828 --> 00:39:32,914
Mulder. Stop.

369
00:39:33,831 --> 00:39:37,710
We're agents for the FBI.
I'm reaching for my ID.

370
00:39:38,878 --> 00:39:43,675
- We're conducting an investigation.
- Proceed down the hallway, please.

371
00:39:48,721 --> 00:39:50,807
This is Level 2 to Level 6.

372
00:39:50,890 --> 00:39:53,768
I have a male and a female
who've identified...

373
00:39:53,851 --> 00:39:55,186
Hey! Stop!

374
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:57,397
Hold it!

375
00:40:02,485 --> 00:40:04,571
He took the stairs! Go! Go!

376
00:40:18,585 --> 00:40:20,587
Argh!!

377
00:40:32,765 --> 00:40:34,267
Move! Move!

378
00:40:34,350 --> 00:40:36,185
Hold it!

379
00:40:36,477 --> 00:40:38,980
I said, hold it!

380
00:40:40,231 --> 00:40:42,317
- Whoa!

381
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:47,530
Let him go.

382
00:40:51,492 --> 00:40:52,952
Let him go!

383
00:40:53,244 --> 00:40:54,996
You've done well.

384
00:40:55,538 --> 00:40:57,040
You're dismissed.

385
00:41:07,967 --> 00:41:09,969
I know how badly...

386
00:41:10,053 --> 00:41:15,183
...how... <i>very</i> badly
you want to look through that window.

387
00:41:15,266 --> 00:41:18,102
But it would be pointless.

388
00:41:18,186 --> 00:41:19,896
It's dead.

389
00:41:22,899 --> 00:41:26,152
After the Roswell incident in 1947...

390
00:41:26,235 --> 00:41:28,738
...even at the brink of the Cold War...

391
00:41:28,821 --> 00:41:32,617
...there was an ultra-secret conference,
attended by the US...

392
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,079
...the Soviet Union,
the People's Republic of China, Britain...

393
00:41:36,162 --> 00:41:38,247
...both Germanys, France...

394
00:41:38,331 --> 00:41:40,416
And it was agreed that...

395
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:45,171
...should any extraterrestrial
biological entities survive a crash...

396
00:41:45,254 --> 00:41:51,469
...the country that held that being
would be responsible for its extermination.

397
00:41:55,139 --> 00:41:57,141
I, um...

398
00:41:57,225 --> 00:42:02,563
...have the distinction of being one of three
men to have exterminated such a creature.

399
00:42:04,941 --> 00:42:07,235
I was with the CIA in Vietnam.

400
00:42:08,277 --> 00:42:11,614
A UFO was sighted for five nights over Hanoi.

401
00:42:11,698 --> 00:42:15,201
The Marines shot it down
and brought it to us.

402
00:42:18,413 --> 00:42:23,084
Maybe... it didn't know what a gun was.

403
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:25,920
Or perhaps they don't show emotion.

404
00:42:27,964 --> 00:42:30,383
But that...

405
00:42:30,466 --> 00:42:35,263
...innocent and blank expression
as I pulled the trigger...

406
00:42:35,346 --> 00:42:37,849
...has haunted me.

407
00:42:39,642 --> 00:42:41,394
Until I found you.

408
00:42:42,645 --> 00:42:44,772
That's why I come to you, Mr Mulder...

409
00:42:44,856 --> 00:42:47,316
...and will continue to come to you...

410
00:42:47,483 --> 00:42:51,404
...to atone for what I've done.

411
00:42:51,487 --> 00:42:53,906
And maybe sometime...

412
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:57,618
...through you, the truth will be known.

413
00:43:37,033 --> 00:43:39,494
You're awfully quiet, Mr Mulder.

414
00:43:43,122 --> 00:43:45,833
I'm wondering which lie to believe.

415
00:44:36,717 --> 00:44:38,553
Stephanie Donohue

416
00:44:48,604 --> 00:44:50,690
<i>I made this!</i>
