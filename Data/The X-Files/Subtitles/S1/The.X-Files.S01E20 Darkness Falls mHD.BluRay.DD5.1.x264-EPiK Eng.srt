1
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:07,509
You're supposed to be in charge, Perkins.

2
00:00:07,593 --> 00:00:09,636
- I am in charge.
- These men want answers.

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,473
What's your plan?
This thing could kill us all.

4
00:00:13,557 --> 00:00:16,393
We should've left two days ago.
No one would listen to me.

5
00:00:16,476 --> 00:00:19,563
Nobody knew what it was then.
Nobody knows now.

6
00:00:19,646 --> 00:00:23,692
- Somebody has to go for help.
- What will the rest of us do?

7
00:00:23,775 --> 00:00:27,696
- Just wait here till help arrives?
- One of us has to hike out!

8
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:31,950
That person might not make it
down to the road before nightfall!

9
00:00:32,034 --> 00:00:34,703
Then what? I say we make a run for it.

10
00:00:34,786 --> 00:00:38,832
- Split up, take our chances.
- It's suicide, Dyer.

11
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:43,086
Fine. You stay here, tell us how it turns out.

12
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:16,870
You're going the wrong way!

13
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:41,395
- I think it's broken.
- Come on, you gotta get up!

14
00:01:41,478 --> 00:01:43,981
I don't think I can make it.

15
00:01:48,402 --> 00:01:50,487
We gotta keep moving!

16
00:01:51,947 --> 00:01:54,032
We're not gonna make it!

17
00:02:58,388 --> 00:03:01,683
- Take a good look, Scully.
- What am I looking at?

18
00:03:01,767 --> 00:03:05,645
30 loggers working a clear-cutting
contract in Washington State.

19
00:03:05,812 --> 00:03:09,107
Rugged, manly men
in the full bloom of manhood.

20
00:03:09,274 --> 00:03:11,276
But what am I looking <i>for?</i>

21
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:15,197
Anything strange, unexplainable,
unlikely... boyfriend?

22
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:18,033
I don't know. I give up, Mulder.

23
00:03:18,116 --> 00:03:22,287
You give up? That's what
the Federal Forest Service has done.

24
00:03:22,371 --> 00:03:25,457
- What happened to them?
- They vanished.

25
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:27,626
Or so it would appear.

26
00:03:29,169 --> 00:03:31,755
This is Doug Spinney and Steven Teague.

27
00:03:31,838 --> 00:03:36,551
They're monkey-wrenchers, the guys
who sabotage logging equipment...

28
00:03:36,635 --> 00:03:39,554
...and make life miserable for lumberjacks.

29
00:03:40,055 --> 00:03:43,141
Eco-terrorists
or militant environmentalists.

30
00:03:43,475 --> 00:03:46,561
Two weeks ago,
the loggers radioed a message...

31
00:03:46,645 --> 00:03:49,564
...that Spinney and Teague
had gone on a spree.

32
00:03:49,648 --> 00:03:52,901
Sabotaging equipment,
causing general mischief.

33
00:03:52,984 --> 00:03:56,238
One week later,
radio communication was cut off.

34
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:58,573
- Do they know why?
- No.

35
00:03:58,657 --> 00:04:02,911
The lumber company asked the Federal
Forest Service to look into it.

36
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:06,164
Two officials were sent in.
No one's heard from them.

37
00:04:06,331 --> 00:04:09,960
The monkey-wrenchers are doing
more than mischief-making.

38
00:04:10,043 --> 00:04:13,046
That's what the Federal Forest
Service think.

39
00:04:13,171 --> 00:04:17,467
They've asked the FBI to investigate.
I had to pull strings to get the case.

40
00:04:17,634 --> 00:04:21,138
For an eco-terrorism case?
Do I dare ask why?

41
00:04:21,263 --> 00:04:23,807
In 1934, long before anyone knew...

42
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,768
...what an eco-terrorist was, a WPA crew...

43
00:04:26,852 --> 00:04:29,896
...working that area vanished
without a trace.

44
00:04:30,021 --> 00:04:33,316
Not one of those men was ever found
or heard from again.

45
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,819
- And you suspect - what?
- Bigfoot?

46
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:40,240
Not likely. That's a lot of flannel
to choke down even for Bigfoot!

47
00:04:41,867 --> 00:04:44,077
Come on, Scully,
it'll be a nice trip to the forest.

48
00:05:12,230 --> 00:05:14,065
Hi.

49
00:05:14,149 --> 00:05:16,818
Fox Mulder and Dana Scully.
We're with the FBI.

50
00:05:16,902 --> 00:05:21,990
Larry Moore, Federal Forest Service.
You can put your gear in the back.

51
00:05:22,324 --> 00:05:24,993
Must be pretty rugged where we're going.

52
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:26,536
Yeah.

53
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,997
Is that a bullet hole in your windshield?

54
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,209
- 22 calibre.
- Somebody take a shot at you?

55
00:05:32,292 --> 00:05:34,836
There's not much to hunt around here...

56
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,756
- ..with 22s except Freddies.
- Freddies?

57
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:41,843
The Federal Forest Service.
It's what eco-terrorists call us.

58
00:05:41,927 --> 00:05:44,471
Is that who you think took a shot at you?

59
00:05:44,554 --> 00:05:46,598
Let me get this outta the way.

60
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:50,227
I have no quarrel with eco-terrorists
in principle.

61
00:05:50,310 --> 00:05:54,564
I'm as concerned for this forest
and the environment as anybody.

62
00:05:54,648 --> 00:05:56,858
It's their methods I can't condone.

63
00:05:56,942 --> 00:05:59,402
Would they go so far as to kill a man?

64
00:05:59,486 --> 00:06:04,241
There's 30 men up there unaccounted for,
each with survival experience.

65
00:06:04,324 --> 00:06:06,409
<i>Something</i> happened to 'em.

66
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:11,706
Sorry I'm late.
I was talking to Bob Perkins' wife.

67
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:15,126
He's one of our missing loggers.

68
00:06:15,377 --> 00:06:18,713
Steve Humphreys, head of security
for Schiff-Immergut Lumber.

69
00:06:18,797 --> 00:06:20,966
Mulder, Scully.

70
00:06:21,049 --> 00:06:25,387
We've got a four-hour drive.
Plenty of time to get to know each other.

71
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:30,934
Get the impression we've walked into
the middle of a war that's already started?

72
00:06:39,651 --> 00:06:42,821
Why do these men work
so far up in the wilderness?

73
00:06:42,946 --> 00:06:45,574
- That's where the trees are.
- You're kidding, right?

74
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,911
No, environmentalists have made sure
the land is untouchable.

75
00:06:49,995 --> 00:06:52,330
Force us to take timber where we can.

76
00:06:52,414 --> 00:06:55,083
We plant saplings for every tree we take.

77
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,586
So why do the eco-terrorists target you?

78
00:06:57,669 --> 00:07:00,755
These tree-huggers are
the same kinda boys...

79
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:05,343
...who went up to Canada during
the Vietnam war. They're cowardly.

80
00:07:05,427 --> 00:07:07,804
Dammit!

81
00:07:08,888 --> 00:07:13,268
Home-made tyre spike -
clear through the sidewall. It's unfixable.

82
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:16,855
- You got a spare, don't you?
- Right tyre's history, too.

83
00:07:16,938 --> 00:07:19,024
The monkey-wrenchers call it a caltrop.

84
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:21,109
The roads are littered with them.

85
00:07:21,234 --> 00:07:26,406
Indiscriminate. Imagine somebody
spiking Washington's roads.

86
00:07:26,781 --> 00:07:28,908
Like to see how much sympathy
they'd get then!

87
00:07:28,992 --> 00:07:31,328
So how are we gonna get up to the camp?

88
00:07:31,411 --> 00:07:33,496
We're gonna have to hike.

89
00:08:30,011 --> 00:08:32,097
Anybody here?

90
00:08:37,185 --> 00:08:39,604
Someone forgot to clean their plate.

91
00:08:39,688 --> 00:08:42,857
It looks like they left in a hurry, too.

92
00:08:51,366 --> 00:08:53,451
They forgot to pack.

93
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,584
- Find anything?
- Party favours.

94
00:09:01,668 --> 00:09:05,338
Vehicles have been monkey-wrenched.
Generator's busted.

95
00:09:05,422 --> 00:09:07,799
Someone turned this place upside down.

96
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:10,635
And they didn't want the fact broadcast.

97
00:09:21,146 --> 00:09:23,398
The radiators are all full of rice.

98
00:09:23,481 --> 00:09:27,527
Sugar or sand in all the crankcases.
They really did a number.

99
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:30,280
The sun's going down in an hour and a half.

100
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:32,449
Better look around before dark.

101
00:09:32,532 --> 00:09:35,452
I'll see if I can get that generator working.

102
00:09:35,535 --> 00:09:38,163
- You were right about one thing.
- What's that?

103
00:09:38,246 --> 00:09:40,331
It definitely wasn't Bigfoot.

104
00:10:00,643 --> 00:10:02,729
Look at that!

105
00:10:03,772 --> 00:10:05,857
What is it?

106
00:10:06,816 --> 00:10:08,860
It looks like a hive.

107
00:10:08,943 --> 00:10:12,530
- Maybe a cocoon of some kind.
- Made by what?

108
00:10:12,614 --> 00:10:15,742
I don't know. I've never seen
anything like it.

109
00:10:25,084 --> 00:10:27,128
Got it.

110
00:10:27,212 --> 00:10:31,174
- Can you cut it down?
- Yeah, I think so.

111
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:44,521
You all right, Scully?

112
00:11:09,504 --> 00:11:11,589
Oh, God!

113
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:24,102
It feels, uh... It feels desiccated,
hard and dry.

114
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:26,145
Almost... preserved.

115
00:11:26,229 --> 00:11:28,565
Like it's been embalmed.

116
00:11:28,648 --> 00:11:32,944
No, more like all the fluids
have been bled from its body.

117
00:11:33,027 --> 00:11:35,321
Almost like it's been cured.

118
00:11:35,405 --> 00:11:37,240
I think...

119
00:11:37,323 --> 00:11:39,325
...it's a male.

120
00:11:39,409 --> 00:11:40,910
Barely.

121
00:11:40,994 --> 00:11:44,205
I'd say it's some kind of spider's nest...

122
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:46,499
...or insect cocoon.

123
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:51,421
What kind of insect could have gotten
a man all the way up into that tree?

124
00:11:51,504 --> 00:11:54,007
Itsy-bitsy spider.

125
00:12:53,107 --> 00:12:55,526
Don't move!

126
00:12:55,610 --> 00:12:57,487
Who are you?

127
00:13:01,866 --> 00:13:04,494
Doug Spinney.
I ought to shoot you where you stand.

128
00:13:04,577 --> 00:13:06,454
Might as well shoot yourself.

129
00:13:06,537 --> 00:13:08,539
You're in a helluva spot to test me.

130
00:13:08,623 --> 00:13:11,417
- What happened to my men?
- What men?

131
00:13:11,501 --> 00:13:13,836
The men who were working this camp.

132
00:13:15,463 --> 00:13:20,134
I don't know. The same thing that'll
happen to us when the sun goes down.

133
00:13:20,218 --> 00:13:23,471
- What are you doing?
- This animal's Doug Spinney.

134
00:13:23,554 --> 00:13:25,890
He's responsible for the monkey-wrenching.

135
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,601
- Probably a murderer.
- I'm no murderer.

136
00:13:28,685 --> 00:13:30,269
- Liar!
- Let's hear what he has to say.

137
00:13:30,395 --> 00:13:34,107
If we stand around here talking,
there'll be nothing left to say.

138
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:36,818
I'd get that generator started.

139
00:13:36,901 --> 00:13:38,820
Darkness is our enemy.

140
00:13:38,987 --> 00:13:40,989
What's he talking about?

141
00:13:41,072 --> 00:13:43,116
Someone wanna give me a hand?

142
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:45,827
He's giving orders? I fixed the damn thing!

143
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,037
Hey, it's all right.

144
00:13:56,838 --> 00:13:59,590
Why did you say
the darkness was our enemy?

145
00:14:00,717 --> 00:14:02,844
That's when they come.

146
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:07,682
- When who comes?
- I don't know what it is.

147
00:14:07,765 --> 00:14:09,434
They come from the sky.

148
00:14:09,517 --> 00:14:12,603
They take a man off his feet
and devour him alive.

149
00:14:12,687 --> 00:14:15,523
- I saw it happen.
- Happen to who?

150
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,488
I need to eat. I haven't eaten in three days.

151
00:14:26,325 --> 00:14:29,871
What kinda BS story is that, huh?
You believe that?

152
00:14:31,122 --> 00:14:34,000
- We found something in the forest.
- What?

153
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:37,378
A man caught
in some kind of insect cocoon.

154
00:14:42,175 --> 00:14:46,387
- What happened here?
- We camped two valleys over.

155
00:14:46,471 --> 00:14:50,224
- Four of us, three now.
- More rats in the woodpile.

156
00:14:52,393 --> 00:14:54,437
Our truck has a dead battery.

157
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,815
We drew straws for who'd hike here
to steal one from the loggers.

158
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,360
- Why not just hike out?
- It's more than a day's hike.

159
00:15:01,444 --> 00:15:04,030
No way we'd want
to be caught out after dark.

160
00:15:04,113 --> 00:15:06,365
Not after what happened to Teague.

161
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:08,743
The man you said was devoured alive?

162
00:15:08,826 --> 00:15:09,827
Yeah.

163
00:15:09,911 --> 00:15:13,581
- What are you guys doing out here?
- Camping.

164
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:16,501
The kind of camping <i>you</i> do
is a federal of fence.

165
00:15:16,626 --> 00:15:19,170
- Hold off a second.
- He's right.

166
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:23,800
This man's a felon.
He could be placed under arrest.

167
00:15:23,883 --> 00:15:26,969
What about <i>your</i> of fence, my friend, huh?

168
00:15:27,053 --> 00:15:29,097
The of fence against nature!

169
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,768
We operate within the law.
We pay for the right to take those trees.

170
00:15:33,851 --> 00:15:38,231
Oh, yeah? Your logging crew is taking trees
that nobody has a right to.

171
00:15:38,314 --> 00:15:43,361
Trees that are marked! So don't talk
to me about breaking the law... sir!

172
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:46,864
- They've been taking marked trees?
- Yessir.

173
00:15:46,948 --> 00:15:50,451
Old-growth trees?
Know anything about that, Steve?

174
00:15:51,702 --> 00:15:53,579
No.

175
00:15:56,082 --> 00:15:58,543
Gonna take this man's word over mine?

176
00:16:01,963 --> 00:16:06,384
You don't wanna go out in the night.
Take my word on <i>that.</i>

177
00:16:07,385 --> 00:16:09,428
It's out there.

178
00:16:09,554 --> 00:16:14,725
If I go out, somebody will attack me,
eat me alive and spin me in its web

179
00:16:14,809 --> 00:16:16,769
Yes.

180
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:20,356
It's too polite to come in here and get me?

181
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:23,317
For some reason, it's afraid of the light.

182
00:16:23,401 --> 00:16:27,989
- "It's afraid of the light"!
- There may be something to it.

183
00:16:28,072 --> 00:16:31,826
He's a murderer and just clever enough
to make up that story.

184
00:16:31,909 --> 00:16:34,912
Even to whip up that cocoon
to save a few trees.

185
00:16:34,996 --> 00:16:37,582
And I'm gonna prove I'm right.

186
00:16:40,084 --> 00:16:42,170
This is ridiculous!

187
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,387
Where is it, Spinney?

188
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:54,473
I thought it was gonna come...

189
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:57,059
...and devour me!

190
00:16:57,143 --> 00:16:59,437
- Hey, here I am!

191
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:04,859
Come out, come out, wherever you are!

192
00:17:07,278 --> 00:17:09,280
Aaw, don't be shy.

193
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:11,449
Come on!

194
00:17:12,283 --> 00:17:13,701
Huh?

195
00:17:13,784 --> 00:17:18,956
It's just like I told you. There's nothing
out here but a bunch of trees.

196
00:17:19,373 --> 00:17:21,709
Trees this man values more than human life.

197
00:17:21,792 --> 00:17:24,587
I'm gonna see him tried on murder charges.

198
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:30,051
What do <i>you</i> think?

199
00:17:30,134 --> 00:17:33,971
I think I'm gonna suggest
that we sleep with the lights on.

200
00:17:58,329 --> 00:18:00,164
See this Douglas fir?

201
00:18:00,289 --> 00:18:03,834
It's been here since before time
and your men cut it down.

202
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,671
- Who marks these trees?
- Forest Service.

203
00:18:06,796 --> 00:18:09,674
You're only supposed to cut trees
marked with a blue X.

204
00:18:09,799 --> 00:18:12,760
This tree must be hundreds of years old.

205
00:18:12,843 --> 00:18:15,513
You must get a lot of lumber from a big tree.

206
00:18:15,638 --> 00:18:20,101
Thousands of board feet.
Helluva lot easier than taking smaller trees.

207
00:18:20,184 --> 00:18:25,022
Monkey-wrenchers like Spinney
are not above marking trees.

208
00:18:25,106 --> 00:18:27,024
This tree's 500 years old if it's a day.

209
00:18:27,108 --> 00:18:28,985
Look at this.

210
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:32,280
What would this represent?

211
00:18:34,949 --> 00:18:38,536
I don't know.
I've never seen a ring like that before.

212
00:18:38,619 --> 00:18:41,122
Those centre rings are the older rings?

213
00:18:41,205 --> 00:18:43,958
Every ring represents a season of growth.

214
00:18:44,041 --> 00:18:47,712
You see these? These are 500, 600 years old.

215
00:18:47,795 --> 00:18:51,215
They're a recorded history
of rainfall and climate.

216
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:55,303
But this one... I don't know.
I should take a core sample.

217
00:18:55,386 --> 00:18:59,640
We finished this nature walk? I wanna know
what happened to the loggers.

218
00:18:59,724 --> 00:19:03,477
- We're determining that, sir.
- Looking at a tree stump?

219
00:19:03,561 --> 00:19:06,647
- Interrogate this man.
- I don't think he did it.

220
00:19:06,731 --> 00:19:09,483
- I want him arrested.
- He's not going anywhere.

221
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:13,821
Not with a gun on him. What happens
if his three buddies show up...

222
00:19:13,904 --> 00:19:15,906
...and do to you what they did...

223
00:19:16,032 --> 00:19:18,492
...to those Federal Forest officials?

224
00:19:18,576 --> 00:19:20,911
I just wanna take a core sample.

225
00:19:20,995 --> 00:19:24,665
I got families who want answers
about loved ones and so do you!

226
00:19:24,749 --> 00:19:27,084
They won't be found in that tree!

227
00:19:27,168 --> 00:19:29,837
The only crime is the death of that tree.

228
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:32,089
Yeah, well, we'll see about that.

229
00:19:35,718 --> 00:19:38,429
- Where are you going?
- Down to your truck.

230
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:42,433
I'll get on the horn and get people
up here who'll take some action.

231
00:19:42,558 --> 00:19:44,602
- Steve!
- Oh, let him go.

232
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:46,937
Let him find out for himself.

233
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:53,277
This is odd.

234
00:19:53,402 --> 00:19:56,614
This yellow ring's got something living in it.

235
00:19:56,864 --> 00:19:58,908
Some kind of...

236
00:19:58,991 --> 00:20:00,701
...tiny bug.

237
00:20:00,785 --> 00:20:02,787
It doesn't make sense.

238
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,372
Why not?

239
00:20:04,455 --> 00:20:07,875
Well, parasites attack a tree
in a variety of ways...

240
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,795
...but they always attack the living parts.

241
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:13,798
The leaves, the roots, the new growth rings.

242
00:20:13,881 --> 00:20:16,967
Even if they're borers of some kind...

243
00:20:17,051 --> 00:20:19,095
...they wouldn't work so deep.

244
00:20:19,178 --> 00:20:21,555
They seem to be feeding
on this ring's wood.

245
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:23,641
Can you identify them?

246
00:20:23,724 --> 00:20:26,977
It's a wood mite of some kind.
Nothing I've ever seen.

247
00:20:27,061 --> 00:20:29,188
Can they have been there centuries?

248
00:20:29,271 --> 00:20:33,526
I don't see how.
These inner rings are essentially dead wood.

249
00:20:33,609 --> 00:20:37,822
The tree's vascular system
is limited to the outer few rings.

250
00:20:37,905 --> 00:20:39,949
They need water to survive.

251
00:20:40,032 --> 00:20:42,868
They appear to be hatching
out of the porous wood.

252
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:47,832
Maybe when you drilled this core,
you tapped into a larger nest.

253
00:20:47,998 --> 00:20:49,667
Can they build a cocoon?

254
00:20:52,253 --> 00:20:55,589
Right after that tree was cut down
was when Teague died.

255
00:20:55,673 --> 00:20:58,426
It's about the same time
when the loggers disappeared.

256
00:20:58,926 --> 00:21:00,845
You think mites killed them?

257
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:05,433
Maybe they were dormant for hundreds
of years. Maybe they woke up hungry.

258
00:21:33,002 --> 00:21:34,879
Dammit!

259
00:22:22,343 --> 00:22:25,012
All right, you monkey-wrenchers,
come on out!

260
00:22:29,892 --> 00:22:32,269
I know what you're up to!

261
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:18,500
Humphreys should've been back by now.

262
00:24:18,584 --> 00:24:20,836
These bugs aren't moving any more.

263
00:24:20,919 --> 00:24:23,589
They're either dead or they're asleep.

264
00:24:23,672 --> 00:24:25,799
They don't like the light.

265
00:24:25,883 --> 00:24:29,928
That's weird.
Usually bugs are attracted to light.

266
00:24:30,012 --> 00:24:32,890
These obviously are not your ordinary bugs.

267
00:24:33,015 --> 00:24:35,142
To say the least.

268
00:24:35,768 --> 00:24:41,398
- What do you know about insects?
- Just what I learned in biology courses.

269
00:24:41,482 --> 00:24:44,568
That they're the foundation
of our ecosystem...

270
00:24:44,652 --> 00:24:46,695
...that there are lots of them:

271
00:24:46,779 --> 00:24:48,864
200 million per person on Earth.

272
00:24:48,947 --> 00:24:50,991
And they've been around a long time, right?

273
00:24:51,075 --> 00:24:53,077
About 600 million years.

274
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,245
Even before the dinosaurs. Why?

275
00:24:55,329 --> 00:24:58,207
- And this tree is - what?
- 5, 6, 700 years old?

276
00:24:58,290 --> 00:24:59,625
Yeah.

277
00:24:59,708 --> 00:25:02,419
And these rings represent climatic changes.

278
00:25:02,503 --> 00:25:06,215
So in this year or season
in the life of the tree...

279
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:09,301
...a strange event
produced an abnormal ring.

280
00:25:09,385 --> 00:25:12,262
- Like what, exactly?
- A volcanic eruption.

281
00:25:12,346 --> 00:25:17,267
This chain of mountains running from
Washington to Oregon is still active.

282
00:25:17,351 --> 00:25:21,480
- Remember Mount St Helene?
- How does that explain the bugs?

283
00:25:21,563 --> 00:25:25,192
After Mount St Helene erupted,
radiation was unleashed...

284
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:26,610
...from inside the Earth.

285
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:28,946
Strange things started to grow.

286
00:25:29,071 --> 00:25:32,533
They discovered an amoeba
that can suck a man's brains out.

287
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:34,702
Oh, a brain-sucking amoeba

288
00:25:34,785 --> 00:25:39,456
It's true. In Spirit Lake,
there's cases of swimmers being infected.

289
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,709
A single-celled amoeba can be mutated.

290
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:47,548
But an insect is complex. A mutation
would take years and years to evolve.

291
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:51,218
Maybe what we're dealing with
isn't a mutation at all.

292
00:25:51,301 --> 00:25:56,223
What if it's some kind of extinct
insect larvae in that ring...

293
00:25:56,306 --> 00:26:00,477
...deposited during volcanic activity,
brought up through the root system?

294
00:26:00,561 --> 00:26:02,563
Ancient insect eggs...

295
00:26:02,646 --> 00:26:06,233
...thousands, maybe millions of years old,
lying dormant until...

296
00:26:06,316 --> 00:26:09,278
Until those loggers cut down that tree.

297
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:14,074
That would be poetic justice,
don't you think?

298
00:26:14,158 --> 00:26:16,577
Unleashing the thing
that would end up killing 'em.

299
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,746
And your friend Humphreys.

300
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:22,666
And, who knows... maybe us.

301
00:26:24,585 --> 00:26:27,254
Sweet dreams.

302
00:26:30,507 --> 00:26:34,595
Humphreys might've just hiked outta here.
We don't know he didn't.

303
00:26:34,678 --> 00:26:39,266
Maybe we're letting ourselves get
carried away with this bug story.

304
00:26:39,349 --> 00:26:41,435
Yeah, maybe.

305
00:27:33,237 --> 00:27:35,322
Going somewhere?

306
00:27:35,405 --> 00:27:37,908
- No, I was...
- Doing an auto repair.

307
00:27:38,534 --> 00:27:41,328
Looks like you're planning on cutting out.

308
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:42,830
I got to save my friends.

309
00:27:42,913 --> 00:27:46,041
They could only keep
their generator going 15, 20 hours max.

310
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:49,628
- They're gonna die.
- So why are you sneaking around?

311
00:27:49,711 --> 00:27:53,507
The Forest Service guy wouldn't go for it.
He'd never trust me.

312
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:56,093
He's got no reason to. Neither do I.

313
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:59,346
I can save us all, man.
We've got a jeep just two valleys over.

314
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:02,933
All it needs is a battery.
I could be back in the morning.

315
00:28:03,016 --> 00:28:05,102
We can all drive out tomorrow.

316
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:10,440
You gotta trust me, man.

317
00:28:20,576 --> 00:28:22,619
Radio's back up.

318
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:27,708
It's working?

319
00:28:27,791 --> 00:28:31,962
I'm not getting any reception,
so the receiver could be trashed.

320
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:34,631
And transmissions?
Can you <i>send</i> a message?

321
00:28:34,715 --> 00:28:36,717
We could try.

322
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,804
This is a call for help.
Is there anyone at this frequency?

323
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:48,729
This is Special Agent Mulder, FBI.

324
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:54,651
We have an emergency and a possible
quarantine situation. Our position is...

325
00:29:01,825 --> 00:29:04,161
What happened to the generator?

326
00:29:04,286 --> 00:29:06,580
- I turned it off.
- Turn it back on.

327
00:29:06,663 --> 00:29:11,251
- What happened to the gas can?
- Spinney took it.

328
00:29:11,335 --> 00:29:14,922
He took it? You mean he's gone?

329
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:18,926
He took a battery and some gas.
He'll come back in the morning.

330
00:29:19,009 --> 00:29:21,345
He gave you his personal guarantee

331
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:23,597
He gave me his word, yeah.

332
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,933
The man who gave you his word...

333
00:29:26,016 --> 00:29:29,436
...has made an art out of sabotage
and defying authority.

334
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:33,440
He's probably the same man
who put a bullet through my windshield.

335
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:36,693
At least now we've got one chance
of getting out alive.

336
00:29:36,818 --> 00:29:39,029
One more chance than we had before.

337
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:41,365
- Or one less.
- What do you mean?

338
00:29:41,448 --> 00:29:44,368
Mulder let him leave
with the last of the gas.

339
00:29:44,451 --> 00:29:47,537
This generator's got a quarter tank left.

340
00:29:47,621 --> 00:29:49,539
What about the trucks?

341
00:29:49,623 --> 00:29:52,626
Their tanks were ruptured
or filled with sugar.

342
00:29:52,709 --> 00:29:56,338
By the same man we are now trusting
to keep his word.

343
00:29:57,172 --> 00:30:00,384
Then we gotta get back on the radio,
send out a Mayday.

344
00:30:00,509 --> 00:30:03,637
Every drop of fuel is fuel that'll
keep this genny powered tonight.

345
00:30:03,971 --> 00:30:07,265
I don't wanna be hoping
somebody heard that transmission...

346
00:30:07,349 --> 00:30:10,811
...when this thing quits running
about two in the morning.

347
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:13,021
Do you?

348
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:41,341
- Mulder...
- Look, it's done.

349
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:45,095
I shouldn't have let him go.
Let's just move past it, OK?

350
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:47,347
Fine.

351
00:30:47,431 --> 00:30:49,558
What do you suggest?

352
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:53,437
I don't know. We'll think of something.

353
00:30:54,062 --> 00:30:58,650
I think we have a pretty good idea
what happened to those loggers...

354
00:30:58,775 --> 00:31:01,403
...and what happened to the group in 1934.

355
00:31:01,486 --> 00:31:04,823
- They only found one cocoon.
- It's a very big forest.

356
00:31:04,948 --> 00:31:06,742
What would <i>you</i> have done?

357
00:31:06,825 --> 00:31:10,454
Would I have made a decision alone
that affected the group?

358
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:12,456
Cut the sanctimonious crap!

359
00:31:12,581 --> 00:31:17,002
What do you want me to say?
Let's face it, we might die up here.

360
00:31:17,085 --> 00:31:19,421
They may find our bodies
spun up in a tree...

361
00:31:19,504 --> 00:31:21,631
...or they may not find us at all!

362
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:26,344
You're right.
And we're wasting time arguing about it.

363
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,447
- What are you gonna do?
- Button this place up.

364
00:31:45,530 --> 00:31:47,324
If we gotta spend the night in here...

365
00:31:47,407 --> 00:31:51,870
...we gotta do everything we can
to make sure the bugs stay out there.

366
00:32:06,093 --> 00:32:09,638
Be careful with that.
It's the only bulb that works.

367
00:32:55,934 --> 00:32:57,644
I can see them.

368
00:33:00,939 --> 00:33:03,024
You guys, look at this.

369
00:33:08,446 --> 00:33:10,782
They're coming through the wall...

370
00:33:10,866 --> 00:33:13,368
...down where it's dark, you see them?

371
00:33:17,831 --> 00:33:19,374
Ugh!

372
00:33:20,208 --> 00:33:22,878
- They're on me!
- It's all right, Scully.

373
00:33:22,961 --> 00:33:25,380
- Scully, Scully...
- Get them off me!

374
00:33:25,463 --> 00:33:27,716
- Get them off me!
- Stand still!

375
00:33:27,799 --> 00:33:30,510
- Stop it, stop it!
- Can you see them?

376
00:33:30,594 --> 00:33:33,513
- Get them off me!
- They're not just on you.

377
00:33:33,597 --> 00:33:36,057
That's what that greasy residue is.

378
00:33:36,141 --> 00:33:38,727
We were supposed to be safe in the light!

379
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:42,105
We are! I think the light
keeps them from swarming.

380
00:33:42,189 --> 00:33:45,025
We'll be safe as long as we stay in the light.

381
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,847
How are you feeling?

382
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:18,516
I'm OK.

383
00:34:24,648 --> 00:34:26,733
They're oxidising enzymes.

384
00:34:26,816 --> 00:34:28,902
Just like fireflies.

385
00:34:31,404 --> 00:34:34,241
Maybe that's why they cocoon their prey.

386
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:38,912
So they can oxidise the proteins
taken from the fluids in the body.

387
00:34:46,169 --> 00:34:47,963
What if the generator goes?

388
00:34:48,046 --> 00:34:50,423
Are they gonna swarm in
and drain the life out of us?

389
00:34:50,674 --> 00:34:52,842
We got an hour and a half till sunrise.

390
00:34:52,968 --> 00:34:55,595
Then what? It's over a day's hike
out of here.

391
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:58,014
We won't make it on foot by nightfall.

392
00:34:58,098 --> 00:35:02,102
Maybe someone heard our transmission.
Help could be on the way.

393
00:35:02,185 --> 00:35:07,482
You sent that call hours ago.
I mean, help would've been here by now.

394
00:35:09,025 --> 00:35:11,611
Well, I'm not gonna give up on Spinney.

395
00:35:12,445 --> 00:35:15,198
He gave me his word
he'd come back to get us.

396
00:35:15,282 --> 00:35:17,325
And if he doesn't?

397
00:35:18,368 --> 00:35:20,453
We'll think of something.

398
00:36:11,546 --> 00:36:14,758
You got a patch kit
or an extra tube in your truck?

399
00:36:14,841 --> 00:36:16,092
Yeah.

400
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:19,220
Maybe we can patch this.
And with the spare in your truck...

401
00:36:19,304 --> 00:36:21,890
...maybe we can limp down the mountain.

402
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:28,730
If not, we can get on the radio
and warn them what's out there.

403
00:37:03,723 --> 00:37:05,809
- You see it?
- Yeah.

404
00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:23,076
Listen.

405
00:37:23,159 --> 00:37:25,161
You hear that?

406
00:37:25,286 --> 00:37:27,330
It's a car.

407
00:37:32,001 --> 00:37:34,087
No, it's a jeep!

408
00:37:37,799 --> 00:37:40,677
- We gotta move! Let's go, let's go!
- Wait!

409
00:37:40,760 --> 00:37:42,971
What about Humphreys' body?

410
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:45,849
Leave it. I've radioed for help.

411
00:37:45,932 --> 00:37:49,602
- What happened to your friends?
- They didn't make it.

412
00:37:49,686 --> 00:37:54,691
We're not gonna make it either
unless we haul ass! Let's go!

413
00:38:30,185 --> 00:38:31,728
Oh!

414
00:38:33,396 --> 00:38:35,231
Dammit!

415
00:38:43,531 --> 00:38:45,575
I don't believe it!

416
00:38:46,576 --> 00:38:50,246
And you talk about
shooting yourself in the foot!

417
00:38:56,211 --> 00:38:58,254
- Agghh!
- Get outta there!

418
00:38:58,338 --> 00:39:02,258
- Get back in the car!
- Agghh, agghh!

419
00:40:27,427 --> 00:40:29,596
Emergency evacuation situation.

420
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:32,098
Requesting quarantine facility...

421
00:40:32,181 --> 00:40:35,768
...for two, possibly three victims
with undiagnosed infection...

422
00:40:35,852 --> 00:40:38,146
...or exposure to unknown biological vectors.

423
00:40:38,229 --> 00:40:43,526
Two, possibly...

424
00:40:47,905 --> 00:40:50,575
<i>Attention all personnel.</i>

425
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:54,621
<i>High-level bio-clearance</i>
<i>required on third floor.</i>

426
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:37,205
<i>- </i> How are you feeling?
- Better.

427
00:41:37,288 --> 00:41:39,332
How did the tests come back?

428
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:41,709
Your respiratory charts were good.

429
00:41:41,793 --> 00:41:45,797
We were concerned about the extent
of damage through inhalation.

430
00:41:45,922 --> 00:41:49,509
There were large concentrations
of the chemical luciferin.

431
00:41:49,592 --> 00:41:51,010
Which is?

432
00:41:51,094 --> 00:41:55,056
The enzyme found in fireflies
and bioluminescent insects.

433
00:41:55,139 --> 00:41:59,018
Our entomologists are trying
to determine the epithet...

434
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:02,063
...of the insects you encountered.

435
00:42:04,482 --> 00:42:06,109
Scully?

436
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:12,615
How's she doing?

437
00:42:12,740 --> 00:42:16,786
She's still not out of the woods.
She lost a lot of fluids.

438
00:42:16,911 --> 00:42:21,207
Two or three more hours of exposure,
she might not have made it.

439
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:24,585
I told her it was gonna be
a nice trip to the forest.

440
00:42:28,631 --> 00:42:31,467
How are you gonna contain it to the forest?

441
00:42:33,094 --> 00:42:34,846
What if the swarm migrates?

442
00:42:34,971 --> 00:42:38,558
The government has initiated
eradication procedures.

443
00:42:38,641 --> 00:42:42,770
By using a combination of
controlled burns and pesticides...

444
00:42:42,854 --> 00:42:45,064
...they will be successful.

445
00:42:45,148 --> 00:42:47,483
And if they're not?

446
00:42:50,319 --> 00:42:52,447
That is not an option, Mr Mulder.
