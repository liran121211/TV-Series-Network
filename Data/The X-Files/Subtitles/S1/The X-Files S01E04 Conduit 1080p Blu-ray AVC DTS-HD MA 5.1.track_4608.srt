1
00:00:54,305 --> 00:00:56,390
(rattling)

2
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:06,651
(woman yells)

3
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,378
Kids...

4
00:01:25,503 --> 00:01:27,463
(boy screaming) Mom! Mom!

5
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:29,257
Kevin!

6
00:01:31,676 --> 00:01:33,761
(cries out in pain)

7
00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:38,182
Mom! Mom! Mom!

8
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:40,393
Mom! Mom!

9
00:01:41,394 --> 00:01:44,438
Mom! Ruby's gone!

10
00:01:46,857 --> 00:01:48,943
Ruby?

11
00:01:49,277 --> 00:01:51,362
Ruby!

12
00:01:52,029 --> 00:01:54,115
Ruby!

13
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:57,535
Ruby!

14
00:02:00,705 --> 00:02:02,748
Ruby!

15
00:02:58,971 --> 00:03:01,349
(Blevins) Agent Mulder's latest 302.

16
00:03:01,432 --> 00:03:05,603
Requesting assignment
and travel expenses for the both of you.

17
00:03:07,938 --> 00:03:11,734
Sioux City, Iowa.
That's the first I've heard of it.

18
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:17,198
It came up through channels, from Mulder's
ASAC to the District G-14, then my desk.

19
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,950
I don't understand.

20
00:03:22,161 --> 00:03:24,830
(Blevins)
In essence, Mulder wants the Bureau...

21
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:28,542
...to assign a case number
to a tabloid headline.

22
00:03:28,626 --> 00:03:32,630
- He must have more evidence than...
- Not according to his 302.

23
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:34,799
I admit, that is strange.

24
00:03:36,133 --> 00:03:37,635
Even for Mulder.

25
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,648
Perhaps it has something to do with this.

26
00:03:50,731 --> 00:03:52,316
Take a look.

27
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,567
An X-File?

28
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,838
Has he shared this with you?

29
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:20,177
There's no need to protect him.
He initiated the file himself.

30
00:04:22,847 --> 00:04:24,890
She was his sister.

31
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:29,061
She disappeared 21 years ago. He was...

32
00:04:29,854 --> 00:04:31,522
...12 and she was 8.

33
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:34,775
He claims that he was in the room
when it happened.

34
00:04:34,859 --> 00:04:39,864
He recalls a...
bright light outside the window and...

35
00:04:41,073 --> 00:04:43,200
...a presence in the room.

36
00:04:43,284 --> 00:04:46,203
In your opinion,

37
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:50,624
has Agent Mulder's personal agenda
clouded his professional judgement?

38
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:53,169
In my opinion, no.

39
00:04:53,252 --> 00:04:55,963
But you can see
how it might appear that way?

40
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:58,466
As you know...

41
00:04:58,549 --> 00:05:02,928
...Mulder's preoccupation
with fringe matters

42
00:05:03,012 --> 00:05:05,222
has been a source of friction in the Bureau.

43
00:05:05,306 --> 00:05:07,558
This is another case in point.

44
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:11,312
I'm going to disallow the 302.

45
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:13,355
With respect, sir,

46
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:19,153
at least let me talk with him
and make a recommendation.

47
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:25,242
It just doesn't seem substantial enough
to warrant an investigation.

48
00:05:25,326 --> 00:05:29,455
So we disagree.
It's not the first time, it won't be the last.

49
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,751
- If we had a legitimate source...
- This is the essence of science.

50
00:05:33,834 --> 00:05:38,547
Ask an impertinent question,
you're on your way to a pertinent answer.

51
00:05:38,631 --> 00:05:41,800
What makes this case any more credible

52
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:45,137
than the 100-year-old mother
with the lizard baby?

53
00:05:45,262 --> 00:05:50,100
Because the lizard baby wasn't born
anywhere near Lake Okobogee.

54
00:05:50,184 --> 00:05:51,310
Oko-what?

55
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:52,770
Bogee.

56
00:05:52,853 --> 00:05:54,939
Okobogee.

57
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:59,151
Is that supposed to mean something to me?

58
00:05:59,276 --> 00:06:02,696
If you know anything about trout fishing.

59
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,865
Or UFO hot spots.

60
00:06:05,866 --> 00:06:07,952
(Scully) Define hot spot.

61
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:13,999
Four sightings in 1967, August, including
one by a National Weather Service plane.

62
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:19,547
This is a light-blasted
digitally-enhanced enlargement.

63
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,465
The pilot took that?

64
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:23,884
Try a Girl Scout with an Instamatic.

65
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:28,931
Four girls said they saw something.
Five, including the Den Mother.

66
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:32,351
The Air Force said it was a weather balloon.

67
00:06:32,476 --> 00:06:36,730
But no weather balloon was launched
that day within 700 miles.

68
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:43,070
Now read me the names
of those Girl Scouts from 1967.

69
00:06:45,322 --> 00:06:49,577
Lisa Terrel, Bonnie Winston,
Doreen McCallister, Darlene Mor...

70
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,042
(Mulder) It's the same Darlene Morris.

71
00:07:31,785 --> 00:07:35,706
Darlene Morris? I'm Agent Scully
and this is Agent Fox Mulder.

72
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:38,417
We talked with you on the phone last night.

73
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:40,586
Please come in.

74
00:07:44,757 --> 00:07:49,887
Well, I knew that if I screamed loud and long
enough that someone would listen.

75
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,056
But I never expected the FBI.

76
00:07:54,224 --> 00:07:56,268
This is Kevin. Kevin...

77
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:57,936
...say hi.

78
00:08:01,607 --> 00:08:03,734
Would you like some coffee?

79
00:08:42,856 --> 00:08:44,942
Some days I can't even...

80
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:47,111
...get myself up out of bed.

81
00:08:49,113 --> 00:08:52,533
And Kevin has been acting so strange.

82
00:08:53,992 --> 00:08:58,330
I don't know what to do any more.
I just want her back again.

83
00:08:58,455 --> 00:09:00,374
(Scully) Ms Morris...

84
00:09:00,457 --> 00:09:04,503
...during the divorce,
was there a custody battle?

85
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:07,297
Charles had nothing to do with this.

86
00:09:07,381 --> 00:09:09,174
How can you be so sure?

87
00:09:09,299 --> 00:09:12,386
Because I know what happened.

88
00:09:12,469 --> 00:09:15,472
It's just like it was before.

89
00:09:15,556 --> 00:09:20,018
- Summer of 1967? The Girl Scout troop?
- How did you know about that?

90
00:09:20,144 --> 00:09:24,898
Your name's on record at the Center
for UFO Studies in Evanston, Illinois.

91
00:09:25,816 --> 00:09:27,735
Really?

92
00:09:27,818 --> 00:09:32,489
A pilot made a similar sighting
over the same area on the same day.

93
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:34,825
They took her, didn't they?

94
00:09:40,414 --> 00:09:45,294
You... you said that, um,
Kevin was there the night it happened?

95
00:09:45,377 --> 00:09:48,547
He didn't see anything. He was asleep.

96
00:09:48,672 --> 00:09:50,591
Can I talk to him anyway?

97
00:09:52,176 --> 00:09:54,219
(Mulder) Thanks.

98
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:04,313
You know...

99
00:10:04,396 --> 00:10:07,191
...I've told this story so many times now.

100
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:10,527
Oh, to the newspapers and the police.

101
00:10:12,196 --> 00:10:18,202
And every time I tell it,
people get this... look in their eye.

102
00:10:19,411 --> 00:10:22,539
Just like the look that you've got right now.

103
00:10:27,127 --> 00:10:29,379
Hey, buddy.

104
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:31,548
Mind if I sit down?

105
00:10:32,049 --> 00:10:34,134
Thanks.

106
00:10:35,886 --> 00:10:38,889
Your mom tells me
you've been having nightmares.

107
00:10:39,431 --> 00:10:41,433
I guess so.

108
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:44,061
- You wanna tell me about 'em?
- No.

109
00:10:44,144 --> 00:10:46,230
All right.

110
00:10:51,235 --> 00:10:53,320
What are you doing?

111
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:58,659
Are you making something?

112
00:10:58,742 --> 00:11:00,786
Can I take a look at it?

113
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:07,459
Thanks.

114
00:11:12,422 --> 00:11:14,466
It's coming from there.

115
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,679
The TV?

116
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:36,196
(Mulder) Maybe it's a binary sequence.
Could be anything, could be nothing.

117
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,948
I know you're busy.

118
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:40,367
Look, I know a friend who knows a friend

119
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,370
who can get you a ticket
to 3 Redskins game.

120
00:11:43,453 --> 00:11:45,038
You got it!

121
00:11:45,122 --> 00:11:47,416
All right. You know where to find me?

122
00:11:47,499 --> 00:11:49,626
Thanks, Danny.

123
00:11:50,168 --> 00:11:54,381
So, as I was telling your partner,
we found no evidence of kidnap.

124
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,508
No phone call, no ransom note.

125
00:11:56,633 --> 00:12:00,804
- And since we have no body...
- (Mulder) You assumed she ran away?

126
00:12:00,888 --> 00:12:04,641
It wouldn't be the first time
Ruby ran away from home.

127
00:12:04,725 --> 00:12:08,228
How do you explain what her mother saw?

128
00:12:08,312 --> 00:12:12,065
I think Darlene
has a very active imagination.

129
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:14,484
I've heard those stories since first grade.

130
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:18,196
So, basically, you ignored her statement.

131
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,451
I included it in my report.

132
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:25,078
But you didn't bother to check it out.

133
00:12:25,162 --> 00:12:27,414
We found nothing at the campsite.

134
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:31,877
Let me tell you something.
Darlene's little girl was no prom queen.

135
00:12:32,002 --> 00:12:36,256
I can't count the number of times
I pulled her out of parked cars...

136
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,675
...or found her puking her guts out.

137
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,929
- It was just a matter of time...
- Before what?

138
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:49,937
Before something bad happened. If Darlene
makes up stories to get past that, fine.

139
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,566
But don't tell me it's the truth.
I'm not gonna waste my time.

140
00:12:55,067 --> 00:13:00,030
(Scully) I just think it's a good idea
not to antagonise local law enforcement.

141
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:02,449
Who, me? I'm Mr Congeniality.

142
00:13:02,532 --> 00:13:05,243
We might need his help one of these days.

143
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:07,412
I'll send him a Bundt cake.

144
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,161
(girl) You're looking for Ruby, right?

145
00:13:48,245 --> 00:13:49,621
That's right.

146
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:51,456
Who are you?

147
00:13:51,581 --> 00:13:52,958
Doesn't matter.

148
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,711
Are you a friend of Ruby's?

149
00:13:55,794 --> 00:14:01,008
Ruby didn't have friends.
She just had people she liked to hang with.

150
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,844
And she liked to hang out with you?

151
00:14:04,678 --> 00:14:06,763
I guess we had some times.

152
00:14:06,847 --> 00:14:09,933
- Like the night she disappeared?
- It was Greg.

153
00:14:10,017 --> 00:14:12,686
She was supposed to see him that night.

154
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:16,440
- Who's Greg?
- Her boyfriend, Greg Randall.

155
00:14:17,607 --> 00:14:21,570
Supposed to meet up at the lake.
They had stuff to talk about.

156
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:23,113
What kind of stuff?

157
00:14:23,613 --> 00:14:25,490
Greg got Ruby pregnant.

158
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:29,411
Whatever. She got herself pregnant.

159
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:32,956
Do you know
what they were planning to do about it?

160
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:38,628
They were gonna leave town.
At least that's what Ruby told me.

161
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:41,798
You know Greg from school?

162
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:45,135
Greg? School?

163
00:14:45,218 --> 00:14:47,554
I don't think so.

164
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:52,476
All he ever did since we met him
was pour beer. The Pennsylvania Pub.

165
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,978
(books fall)

166
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,711
(heavy rock music)

167
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:38,563
Excuse me! Do you know
where we can find Greg Randall?

168
00:15:38,688 --> 00:15:40,732
Who's asking?

169
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,031
What kind of trouble's he in now?

170
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:50,742
We were hoping you could tell us.

171
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:55,122
Greg called in sick three weeks ago.
I haven't heard from him since.

172
00:15:55,205 --> 00:15:58,041
Any ideas where he might have gone?

173
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:01,503
No, but if you find him, tell him he's fired.

174
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:04,965
This is our hotel if you hear of anything.

175
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:16,101
That's a nice tattoo. What is that?

176
00:16:16,226 --> 00:16:18,019
What's it look like?

177
00:16:18,103 --> 00:16:22,524
A flying saucer.
You don't believe that stuff, do you?

178
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,359
I take it you don't?

179
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:29,156
No, I think it's just a bunch of crazy people
howling at the moon.

180
00:16:29,239 --> 00:16:32,909
So, you haven't been out
to Lake Okobogee, have you?

181
00:16:34,077 --> 00:16:35,453
No, I haven't. Why?

182
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,290
You should ride with us some time.

183
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:42,294
You might see some things
that'd change your mind.

184
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:48,758
Get a killer sunburn
in the middle of the night.

185
00:16:53,263 --> 00:16:55,307
(chuckles)

186
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:21,958
(whispering)

187
00:17:45,232 --> 00:17:46,983
(man) Where's Mulder?

188
00:17:50,987 --> 00:17:53,073
Where did you get the document?

189
00:17:53,156 --> 00:17:56,993
If you explain what you're talking about,
maybe I can help.

190
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:07,295
This is a document?

191
00:18:07,379 --> 00:18:10,340
It just looks like
a bunch of ones and zeros to me.

192
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:14,302
- Tell me where you got it.
- Tell me what it is.

193
00:18:14,386 --> 00:18:17,472
Keep playing games
and you'll be facing the D6.

194
00:18:17,555 --> 00:18:21,142
You can explain to them
why you're obstructing justice.

195
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:23,478
It's your call, Holtzman.

196
00:18:23,561 --> 00:18:27,649
But I'm not accountable to anybody
outside my sub-committee.

197
00:18:27,732 --> 00:18:31,444
I don't care if it's the NSA
or the Vatican police.

198
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:36,032
It's a defence satellite transmission.

199
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:38,159
You're kidding!

200
00:18:38,243 --> 00:18:42,706
A fragment, but highly classified.
We need to know where it came from.

201
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:46,376
Well, sure.
I'll let you know as soon as I find out.

202
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:50,380
You just bought yourself
a one-way back to Washington.

203
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:52,966
(conversation on mobile phone)

204
00:18:53,049 --> 00:18:55,135
We got it.

205
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:01,433
(Mulder) Great.

206
00:19:05,145 --> 00:19:06,187
What?

207
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:09,691
You shouldn't have told 'em.
They have no jurisdiction.

208
00:19:09,774 --> 00:19:14,738
Mulder, they're NSA. They think
the boy's a threat to national security.

209
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:20,744
How can an 8-year-old boy who can barely
multiply be a threat to national security?

210
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,537
People call me paranoid.

211
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,499
How did Kevin obtain
top-secret information?

212
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:28,752
Where do you think he got it from?

213
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,954
Watch your step, ma'am.

214
00:20:09,959 --> 00:20:12,504
It'll be OK, baby. Don't worry.

215
00:20:12,629 --> 00:20:14,964
- It'll be OK.
- Come with me, son.

216
00:20:15,298 --> 00:20:16,549
Mom!

217
00:20:18,510 --> 00:20:20,136
It'll be all right, baby.

218
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:24,391
Watch your head, please.

219
00:20:51,543 --> 00:20:54,003
You guys do really delicate work.

220
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:56,589
Let's get this to Cryptography.

221
00:20:57,757 --> 00:21:00,343
I think we got what we needed. Thank you.

222
00:21:15,024 --> 00:21:18,945
- What is it?
- I'm not sure.

223
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:54,522
- We scanned it through the mainframe.
- And none of the information is actionable?

224
00:21:54,606 --> 00:21:59,444
Other than the satellite transmission,
none of it is a national security risk.

225
00:21:59,569 --> 00:22:01,905
The boy's being released later.

226
00:22:01,988 --> 00:22:04,866
So it was just a random set
of ones and zeros?

227
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:07,202
There was nothing random about it.

228
00:22:07,285 --> 00:22:08,661
I don't understand.

229
00:22:08,745 --> 00:22:13,416
All information can be rendered digitally
in a series of ones and zeros.

230
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:19,088
When we downloaded the data, we found
an amazing range of... Well, see for yourself.

231
00:22:19,172 --> 00:22:21,132
Da Vinci's Universal Man.

232
00:22:24,969 --> 00:22:27,096
A DNA double helix.

233
00:22:28,806 --> 00:22:30,934
There's lots more.

234
00:22:32,268 --> 00:22:34,979
(digital music)

235
00:22:35,104 --> 00:22:37,190
That's the Brandenburg Concertos.

236
00:22:37,273 --> 00:22:42,654
But they're just fragments. Some lines
from the Koran, a Shakespearean sonnet.

237
00:22:42,779 --> 00:22:45,323
Like someone's switching channels?

238
00:22:58,836 --> 00:23:01,756
- Mrs Morris?
- I have nothing to say to you.

239
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,300
Please, give me a minute to explain.

240
00:23:08,471 --> 00:23:11,849
Would you please just wait
right over there for mama?

241
00:23:14,811 --> 00:23:20,108
- I thought you were supposed to help us.
- (Scully) This has been a terrible mistake.

242
00:23:20,191 --> 00:23:24,112
The government will pay
for all repairs and damages.

243
00:23:24,195 --> 00:23:26,864
I don't want your money.
I want my daughter back.

244
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:29,117
And I want you to leave us alone.

245
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,953
But your son has seen something.

246
00:23:32,036 --> 00:23:35,373
You stay away from me
and you stay away from my child.

247
00:23:43,673 --> 00:23:45,300
(Darlene) Come on, honey.

248
00:23:45,383 --> 00:23:47,218
It's OK. Let's go now.

249
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,906
I thought we were headed back into town.

250
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:11,743
Where are we going?

251
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:15,371
The boy is the key, Scully. I know it.

252
00:24:15,872 --> 00:24:18,833
- The key to what?
- Finding Ruby.

253
00:24:18,916 --> 00:24:21,753
Just think about it for a minute.

254
00:24:21,878 --> 00:24:25,632
He's receiving digitised data
from a television screen.

255
00:24:25,715 --> 00:24:28,926
Agent Atsumi
said it was a statistical aberration.

256
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:37,852
- I admit it's not much of an explanation...
- I think that Kevin is a conduit of some kind.

257
00:24:37,935 --> 00:24:39,354
A conduit?

258
00:24:39,437 --> 00:24:43,358
A link... or a connection to whoever...

259
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:46,444
...or whatever took Ruby that night.

260
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:47,779
But how?

261
00:24:47,904 --> 00:24:52,784
If there was an abduction, it's likely
that Kevin was touched in some way.

262
00:24:55,495 --> 00:24:57,955
Mulder, I know what you're thinking.

263
00:25:02,251 --> 00:25:04,754
I know why this is so important to you.

264
00:25:06,923 --> 00:25:08,591
I know!

265
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:14,097
But there is no evidence
indicating an abduction.

266
00:25:14,931 --> 00:25:18,142
That's why we're going to Lake Okobogee.

267
00:25:22,105 --> 00:25:24,148
(geese overhead)

268
00:25:24,273 --> 00:25:28,778
According to the police photos,
Ruby and Kevin were sleeping right here.

269
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,364
A stone's throw from the forest wall.

270
00:25:31,447 --> 00:25:33,449
Meaning what?

271
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:37,495
Meaning anybody could have
come out of the forest to grab her.

272
00:25:41,124 --> 00:25:43,376
Have you noticed the tree line?

273
00:25:43,459 --> 00:25:47,004
(Mulder) Evidence of extreme heat.

274
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:49,799
Or an electrical storm.

275
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,220
Besides which, there's nothing
to connect it to the night...

276
00:25:54,303 --> 00:25:57,181
- ...of Ruby's disappearance.
- That's true.

277
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:06,190
Do you think lightning
could have caused this?

278
00:26:06,315 --> 00:26:10,695
Do you have any idea at what
temperature sand solidifies into glass?

279
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:13,740
(Mulder) 2,500° Fahrenheit.

280
00:26:13,823 --> 00:26:18,578
Something was out here. Something
hot enough to turn sand into glass.

281
00:26:18,661 --> 00:26:22,665
To singe those trees
and to blister the roof of that camper.

282
00:26:29,172 --> 00:26:31,174
(animal whining)

283
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:35,052
(whispers) Mulder!

284
00:26:35,178 --> 00:26:37,221
Look!

285
00:27:01,204 --> 00:27:02,872
(cocks gun)

286
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:20,473
What is it?

287
00:27:20,556 --> 00:27:24,560
It's a grave. Shallow, by the smell of it.

288
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:32,401
What are you doing?

289
00:27:34,737 --> 00:27:37,406
Mulder, you are disturbing a crime scene.

290
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:43,162
Stop!

291
00:27:44,247 --> 00:27:46,290
What if it's her?

292
00:27:47,166 --> 00:27:49,252
I need to know.

293
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,940
Are you OK, Mulder?

294
00:28:11,023 --> 00:28:12,358
Fine.

295
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:17,488
Looks like a male Caucasian.

296
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:26,539
Sir.

297
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:33,462
Victim's name was Greg Randall.

298
00:28:35,131 --> 00:28:37,216
Ruby's boyfriend.

299
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,677
Ruby had a lot of boyfriends.

300
00:28:39,802 --> 00:28:43,514
- Can I take a look at that?
- Go right ahead.

301
00:29:19,926 --> 00:29:21,385
Look at that.

302
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:24,347
It's her. The girl from the library.

303
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,514
Who?

304
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:30,061
We didn't get her name, but she claimed
Greg and Ruby had run off together.

305
00:29:30,186 --> 00:29:33,940
Well, Doc Fowler's a buddy of mine.
Delivered both my kids.

306
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:36,651
I can find out who had that appointment.

307
00:29:54,752 --> 00:29:56,879
(Scully) Have a seat, Tessa.

308
00:30:07,723 --> 00:30:10,226
We know that you lied to us the other day.

309
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:14,772
We know that you had the appointment
with Dr Fowler on August 7th.

310
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:18,234
We know that you're pregnant, not Ruby.

311
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:22,446
- Then you don't know nothing.
- We can prove it, Tessa.

312
00:30:22,571 --> 00:30:25,616
And we can prove that Greg...
was the father.

313
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,785
So what if he was the father?

314
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:30,371
(Scully) This is very serious.

315
00:30:30,454 --> 00:30:33,416
Do you understand how serious this is?

316
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:37,503
(Scully) You've waived
the right to an attorney.

317
00:30:37,586 --> 00:30:40,464
So if you lie to us here today...

318
00:30:42,341 --> 00:30:44,802
...you could be charged with perjury.

319
00:30:47,346 --> 00:30:49,432
(sighs)

320
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:53,102
He promised me
we'd be in LA by Christmas.

321
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,397
He had a friend there.

322
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,733
And I'd never seen the ocean.

323
00:30:58,816 --> 00:31:01,652
You said he and Ruby
were seeing each other.

324
00:31:01,777 --> 00:31:06,115
You said they were planning
to meet at the lake. Is that true?

325
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:10,119
Lookit, I was nowhere
near the lake that night, OK?

326
00:31:10,202 --> 00:31:12,121
Sure you were, Tessa.

327
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:18,586
You knew they were meeting,
so you sat and you waited for them.

328
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:21,547
- You were angry and jealous.
- I wasn't.

329
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:26,093
You waited, and when they showed
you killed him first, isn't that how it went?

330
00:31:26,177 --> 00:31:29,055
- No.
- You snuck up and you shot him in the back.

331
00:31:29,138 --> 00:31:31,223
Barn!

332
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:35,394
And then you killed Ruby.

333
00:31:35,478 --> 00:31:36,353
Barn!

334
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:41,901
What was she doin' before she died?

335
00:31:41,984 --> 00:31:45,780
Was she pleading for her life?
Was she running away?

336
00:31:45,863 --> 00:31:47,323
I didn't kill her!

337
00:31:47,406 --> 00:31:49,283
- Where's she buried?
- I don't know!

338
00:31:49,366 --> 00:31:52,870
- You don't know where you buried her?
- I didn't kill her!

339
00:31:52,995 --> 00:31:56,582
- You didn't?
- She wasn't even there that night!

340
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:05,007
Well, how would you know that, Tessa,
if you weren't there yourself?

341
00:32:10,888 --> 00:32:13,307
You're not seeing the whole picture here.

342
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:17,686
- Which is?
- Which is that in all likelihood Ruby is dead.

343
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:21,941
Is that your conclusion
or the Sioux City Sheriff's Department's?

344
00:32:22,024 --> 00:32:26,737
They're searching the National Park
and a dive team is going to drag the lake.

345
00:32:26,862 --> 00:32:28,656
They're wasting their time.

346
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:31,367
Do you really think
Tessa is telling the truth?

347
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,912
Why not?
What if Ruby never did show up that night?

348
00:32:35,037 --> 00:32:38,624
She lied to us in the library
and lied about her pregnancy.

349
00:32:38,707 --> 00:32:41,293
Why wouldn't she lie about killing Ruby?

350
00:32:41,377 --> 00:32:44,922
Because something was out there
in those woods!

351
00:32:46,423 --> 00:32:50,803
We have a suspect in custody.
We have a confession to one murder...

352
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:54,974
...and a statement which speaks
to the intent to commit another.

353
00:32:55,057 --> 00:32:59,687
It's over, Mulder. It's time
to turn this over to local law enforcement.

354
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,272
I can't do that.

355
00:33:02,731 --> 00:33:04,984
Mulder, where are you going?

356
00:33:05,067 --> 00:33:06,694
To talk to the boy.

357
00:33:06,777 --> 00:33:09,697
- Darlene won't let you.
- I've gotta see him.

358
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:12,324
They don't want anything to do with us!

359
00:33:12,408 --> 00:33:15,578
Mulder, stop! Stop running after your sister.

360
00:33:20,291 --> 00:33:22,334
This won't bring her back.

361
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:28,924
Come with me or don't, but until they
find a body I'm not giving up on that girl.

362
00:33:42,646 --> 00:33:44,773
(knocks) Hello?

363
00:33:46,609 --> 00:33:48,694
Mrs Morris?

364
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:52,114
Kevin?

365
00:34:08,505 --> 00:34:10,633
(kettle whistling)

366
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:28,525
Mulder?

367
00:34:33,072 --> 00:34:35,157
(Scully) What does it mean?

368
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:37,826
I don't know.

369
00:34:40,579 --> 00:34:42,665
I'm gonna check upstairs.

370
00:34:53,342 --> 00:34:54,885
Oh, my God!

371
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,054
What is it?

372
00:34:58,055 --> 00:34:59,223
Just come up here.

373
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:08,023
Look.

374
00:35:10,401 --> 00:35:11,402
It's her!

375
00:35:13,028 --> 00:35:14,446
It's Ruby.

376
00:35:30,754 --> 00:35:33,465
This is a long shot. They could be anywhere.

377
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,386
You know, when I was a kid...

378
00:35:38,387 --> 00:35:40,055
...I had this ritual.

379
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:45,561
I'd close my eyes
before I walked into my room.

380
00:35:45,644 --> 00:35:50,232
Because I thought that one day when
I opened them my sister would be there.

381
00:35:50,983 --> 00:35:54,987
Just lying in bed...
like nothing ever happened.

382
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:00,576
I'm still walking into that room.

383
00:36:01,827 --> 00:36:03,912
Every day of my life.

384
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:10,961
Scully!

385
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:25,017
Daflene!

386
00:36:28,979 --> 00:36:31,106
<i>Look, there's a “ahead.</i>

387
00:36:36,612 --> 00:36:38,697
(woman shouts)

388
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:52,628
- Are you OK?
- It's here. I saw it.

389
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:55,130
- Where's Kevin?
- I couldn't keep up.

390
00:36:55,214 --> 00:36:57,299
(Scully) Go ahead!

391
00:37:09,812 --> 00:37:10,854
Kevin!

392
00:37:19,238 --> 00:37:21,323
(rumbling)

393
00:37:40,217 --> 00:37:42,344
(whooping)

394
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:02,239
- Are you OK?
- She's back!

395
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:04,408
Kevin, I'm sorry, but...

396
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,119
She's here. I know it!

397
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:10,080
Kevin, I don't think she is.

398
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:14,543
- I know you wanted it to be her. I did too.
- (Scully) Mulder!

399
00:38:14,626 --> 00:38:16,712
Come on!

400
00:38:18,213 --> 00:38:20,299
Scully?

401
00:38:24,428 --> 00:38:25,929
(Kevin) Ruby!

402
00:38:26,054 --> 00:38:28,098
She's unconscious but alive.

403
00:38:28,223 --> 00:38:30,726
I'll get help.

404
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:40,819
She's been awake for almost an hour.

405
00:38:40,903 --> 00:38:42,988
Any ideas what caused the coma?

406
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:48,118
No sign of head trauma, no narcotic traces
or electrolyte abnormalities.

407
00:38:48,243 --> 00:38:50,996
But her white blood cell count was sky-high.

408
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:56,460
Any attendant reduction in the lymphocyte
population or release of glucocorticoids?

409
00:38:57,294 --> 00:38:59,421
Um...

410
00:38:59,755 --> 00:39:02,132
Actually, both. How did you know that?

411
00:39:02,257 --> 00:39:05,719
They're symptoms
of prolonged weightlessness.

412
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:09,139
Shuttle astronauts have reported
similar imbalances.

413
00:39:27,282 --> 00:39:29,326
(Scully) Hi.

414
00:39:32,454 --> 00:39:34,790
Hi, Ruby.

415
00:39:36,375 --> 00:39:37,960
Who are you?

416
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:43,632
We're with the FBI. I'm Special Agent
Dana Scully and this is Fox Mulder.

417
00:39:46,552 --> 00:39:48,679
My mom said you might be coming by.

418
00:39:48,804 --> 00:39:50,847
How are you feeling?

419
00:39:52,349 --> 00:39:54,434
Fine, I guess.

420
00:39:54,518 --> 00:39:56,603
(Mulder) Where were you, Ruby?

421
00:39:56,687 --> 00:39:58,397
Can you tell us?

422
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:04,069
It's OK, Ruby. He knows.

423
00:40:06,655 --> 00:40:08,740
I'm not supposed to tell.

424
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,702
They told me not to say.

425
00:40:11,827 --> 00:40:13,078
Who told you?

426
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,375
Ruby, who told you?

427
00:40:19,835 --> 00:40:23,672
Sweetheart, you don't have to say anything.

428
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:29,303
You're right. We should wait
till Ruby gets a little stronger.

429
00:40:29,386 --> 00:40:32,055
Can we speak outside for a moment?

430
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:46,945
I think that it's best
that we put all of this behind us.

431
00:40:47,029 --> 00:40:50,157
I mean,
hasn't Ruby been through enough already?

432
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:55,203
I know how disoriented she must seem
right now. But in a couple of weeks, we...

433
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:58,123
I don't want her talking to you. Or anyone.

434
00:40:58,206 --> 00:41:03,629
She should be encouraged to tell her story.
It's important that you let her.

435
00:41:03,712 --> 00:41:05,547
Important to who?

436
00:41:06,923 --> 00:41:09,718
I have my daughter back.
I don't want more trouble.

437
00:41:09,801 --> 00:41:12,054
Besides, she can't remember anything.

438
00:41:12,137 --> 00:41:15,891
But she will remember one day,
even if it's only in dreams.

439
00:41:15,974 --> 00:41:20,395
When she does, she'll want to talk about it.
She'll need to talk about it.

440
00:41:20,896 --> 00:41:22,397
Like I did?

441
00:41:23,732 --> 00:41:25,567
(Darlene) Listen to me.

442
00:41:25,651 --> 00:41:29,071
I have been ridiculed for speaking my mind.

443
00:41:29,154 --> 00:41:31,323
But it was the truth, Darlene.

444
00:41:31,406 --> 00:41:36,244
It's caused me nothing but heartache.
I don't want the same thing for her.

445
00:41:36,328 --> 00:41:39,081
It doesn't have to be that way for Ruby.

446
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:45,587
As far as I know, she spent the last month
on the back of a Harley-Davidson.

447
00:41:45,921 --> 00:41:48,298
Is that what you'll tell Kevin?

448
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:51,843
I'm sorry.

449
00:42:23,959 --> 00:42:28,714
- (voice on tape) Your eyes are open?
- (Mulder) Yeah, but it's like...

450
00:42:28,797 --> 00:42:32,175
- ...nothing's happening.
- Try turning your head.

451
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,344
(Mulder) I can't.

452
00:42:34,636 --> 00:42:36,722
- Why not?
- I don't know.

453
00:42:38,473 --> 00:42:40,559
I can't move.

454
00:42:41,143 --> 00:42:43,228
So I don't.

455
00:42:45,814 --> 00:42:48,900
- I just lie there in bed.
- Can you see your sister?

456
00:42:49,484 --> 00:42:51,194
No.

457
00:42:51,987 --> 00:42:53,739
<i>BUN can hear her.</i>

458
00:42:53,822 --> 00:42:59,077
- What does she say?
- She's calling out my name...

459
00:42:59,161 --> 00:43:01,246
...over and over again.

460
00:43:01,997 --> 00:43:04,082
She's crying out for help.

461
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:07,127
But I can't help her.

462
00:43:07,210 --> 00:43:09,337
I can't move.

463
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:13,508
- Are you scared?
- I know I should be, but I'm not.

464
00:43:15,051 --> 00:43:19,431
- Do you know why?
- Because of the voice.

465
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:22,267
- The voice?
- The voice in my head.

466
00:43:22,350 --> 00:43:26,062
- What's it telling you?
- Not to be afraid.

467
00:43:27,189 --> 00:43:30,901
It's telling me
that no harm will come to her.

468
00:43:31,026 --> 00:43:33,069
And that one day she'll return.

469
00:43:33,612 --> 00:43:35,697
Do you believe the voice?

470
00:43:38,116 --> 00:43:40,202
(Mulder) I want to believe.
