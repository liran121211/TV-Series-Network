1
00:00:06,967 --> 00:00:11,805
B-I-N-G-O, B-I-N-G-O,
and Bingo was his name-o

2
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:15,934
There was a farmer had a dog
and Bingo was his name-o

3
00:00:16,018 --> 00:00:19,938
B-I-N-G-O, B-I-N-G-O

4
00:00:20,022 --> 00:00:23,901
B-I-N-G-O, and Bingo was his name-o

5
00:00:23,984 --> 00:00:27,905
There was a farmer had a dog
and Bingo was his name-o

6
00:00:27,988 --> 00:00:30,574
- Ah! What was that?
- What's happening?

7
00:00:30,782 --> 00:00:32,951
It's OK, it's OK. I just had a flat.

8
00:00:33,035 --> 00:00:35,287
- Oh, no!
- No problem here, honey.

9
00:00:54,473 --> 00:00:56,558
Darn it!

10
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,165
Honey, would you hold the light?

11
00:01:20,249 --> 00:01:21,708
- Aagh!
- Paul!

12
00:01:23,377 --> 00:01:25,504
Paul!

13
00:01:25,921 --> 00:01:28,006
Paul!

14
00:01:30,676 --> 00:01:32,761
Where are you, Paul?!

15
00:01:34,221 --> 00:01:36,348
What happened?!

16
00:01:37,349 --> 00:01:39,434
Paul!

17
00:02:04,543 --> 00:02:06,712
Over here! I've found something!

18
00:02:18,890 --> 00:02:21,310
His leg's been eaten off.

19
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:26,565
Hey! Up here!

20
00:02:26,648 --> 00:02:29,151
I need some help!

21
00:02:39,578 --> 00:02:41,098
It's in here! It's as tall as a house!

22
00:02:42,247 --> 00:02:44,750
- We can smoke him out.
- And then what?

23
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:50,756
- I see it!
- He's coming at us!

24
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,985
Agent Finley speaking.

25
00:04:00,826 --> 00:04:02,869
Working hard, Mulder?

26
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:06,081
This woman claims she was
taken aboard a spaceship...

27
00:04:06,164 --> 00:04:09,042
...and held in an anti-gravity chamber
for three days.

28
00:04:09,167 --> 00:04:11,211
Anti-gravity is right.

29
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:17,050
Sorry to interrupt
your serious investigation.

30
00:04:17,175 --> 00:04:20,804
- I heard a story that'll take your knees out.
- What's that?

31
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:24,224
They found a body
in the New Jersey woods yesterday...

32
00:04:24,349 --> 00:04:26,643
...missing its right arm and shoulder.

33
00:04:26,726 --> 00:04:30,689
They think
they may have been eaten off... by a human.

34
00:04:31,231 --> 00:04:34,568
- Where in New Jersey?
- Just outside Atlantic City.

35
00:04:34,651 --> 00:04:38,530
Not an uncommon place to lose a body part.
They think it's the Mob?

36
00:04:38,613 --> 00:04:41,450
He was a homeless man.
There's no motive.

37
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,495
You feeling lucky, Scully?

38
00:04:45,579 --> 00:04:47,664
Relative to whom?

39
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:53,920
It's not our case, Mulder.
The local police are handling it.

40
00:04:54,004 --> 00:04:55,922
An X-File?

41
00:04:56,006 --> 00:04:58,967
Ever hear of something
called the Jersey Devil?

42
00:04:59,134 --> 00:05:03,054
A beast that's supposed to come out
of the woods and attack cars...

43
00:05:03,138 --> 00:05:05,223
...like an East Coast Bigfoot.

44
00:05:05,307 --> 00:05:08,059
Read the file about the case in 1947.

45
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:13,815
Save me the trouble.

46
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:17,319
1947. Family watches Dad
get dragged off into the woods.

47
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:20,071
Cops find Dad
with a few appendages gnawed off.

48
00:05:20,197 --> 00:05:23,450
Cops corner a large, naked man
in the woods and gun him down.

49
00:05:23,533 --> 00:05:28,330
Autopsy shows human flesh and bones
in his intestine. A beast man.

50
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:31,291
- Is the autopsy report here?
- Requisition for a car.

51
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:35,337
The original disappeared
from the files after the incident.

52
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:40,675
- There is a statement from the pathologist.
- I've heard this story since I was a kid.

53
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:41,968
It's a folk tale, a myth.

54
00:05:42,052 --> 00:05:45,013
I heard the same story
when I was a kid, too.

55
00:05:45,096 --> 00:05:48,141
Funny thing is, I believed it. Thanks, Doreen.

56
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:51,645
Fact is, we've got
a cannibalised body in New Jersey.

57
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:54,439
Someone or something out there is hungry.

58
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:09,329
They say animals can develop an appetite
for human flesh, but... this is no animal.

59
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:12,374
See the teeth marks,
just below the clavicle?

60
00:06:12,457 --> 00:06:14,584
They're human.

61
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:17,420
- Who found the body?
- A park ranger.

62
00:06:17,504 --> 00:06:19,589
Was he alive when it happened?

63
00:06:19,673 --> 00:06:21,216
It's hard to tell.

64
00:06:21,299 --> 00:06:24,970
There's no sign of a struggle.
His blood alcohol level was up.

65
00:06:25,095 --> 00:06:28,557
- Probably never knew what hit him.
- Any ideas about that?

66
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,352
From the size of that bite mark,
I'd say large, adult male.

67
00:06:32,477 --> 00:06:35,564
- Detective Thompson is handling the case.
- Glenna?

68
00:06:35,647 --> 00:06:39,609
Hi. I'm Special Agent Dana Scully
and this is Agent Fox Mulder.

69
00:06:39,693 --> 00:06:43,029
I don't remember anybody
calling the FBI in on this.

70
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:46,658
We're not here officially.
Agent Scully is a medical doctor.

71
00:06:46,783 --> 00:06:49,995
We heard about your victim
and thought we'd look.

72
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:53,039
I'm sorry. I'm going to ask you to leave.

73
00:06:53,164 --> 00:06:56,793
- We have an investigation.
- Tommy, this is no time to get pissy.

74
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:59,629
- We have jurisdiction here.
- Any suspects yet?

75
00:06:59,713 --> 00:07:01,798
I don't work for you, sir.

76
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:05,677
Unless you hear from the attorney general,
this is a local matter.

77
00:07:05,802 --> 00:07:09,723
- Agent Mulder, we should go.
- No need to get bent out of shape!

78
00:07:09,848 --> 00:07:13,893
On the contrary,
I think I've been exceedingly polite.

79
00:07:22,527 --> 00:07:26,364
- So what's eating that guy?
- He was perfectly in his rights.

80
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:30,243
The FBI has no overriding jurisdiction
in a murder case.

81
00:07:30,368 --> 00:07:33,371
You'd feel the same
if someone horned in on your work.

82
00:07:33,496 --> 00:07:38,168
Chances are, he'll be scratching his head
when they bring the next body in.

83
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:43,089
You could have really humiliated him
and told him who the perpetrator was.

84
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:45,508
The Jersey Devil.

85
00:07:48,511 --> 00:07:53,558
What do you say we grab a hotel, take in
a floor show, drop quarters in the slot...

86
00:07:53,683 --> 00:07:55,477
...do a little digging.

87
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,063
- You're kidding?
- OK, skip the floor show.

88
00:07:58,188 --> 00:08:01,358
- Mulder, I have to be back in DC.
- Have you got a date?

89
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:03,610
No.

90
00:08:03,735 --> 00:08:06,404
I have my godson's birthday party at 6.30.

91
00:08:10,575 --> 00:08:13,828
- What are you doing?
- A little poking around.

92
00:08:13,912 --> 00:08:18,583
- Maybe make a weekend out of it.
- It's a three-hour drive back by myself.

93
00:08:19,042 --> 00:08:21,086
In Friday night traffic.

94
00:08:31,763 --> 00:08:33,890
Change of fifty.

95
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:06,840
I found the body just over there,
lying face down on the rocks.

96
00:09:07,924 --> 00:09:12,053
32 years with the Parks Service,
I've seen some weird stuff...

97
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:14,055
...but never anything like this.

98
00:09:14,139 --> 00:09:18,017
The victim was a homeless man.
You get many wandering around?

99
00:09:18,143 --> 00:09:21,146
Well, occasionally, you'll see some, but...

100
00:09:21,271 --> 00:09:23,314
Most are scared of the woods.

101
00:09:23,648 --> 00:09:25,692
Scared? Of what?

102
00:09:25,817 --> 00:09:27,861
I don't know.

103
00:09:27,986 --> 00:09:30,029
The devil.

104
00:09:31,322 --> 00:09:34,784
- People say that's just a myth.
- Depends on who you talk to.

105
00:09:34,868 --> 00:09:36,953
What do <i>you</i> think?

106
00:09:37,036 --> 00:09:39,122
Well, like I said...

107
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:41,332
...32 years...

108
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,960
...I see a lot of weird stuff.

109
00:09:48,715 --> 00:09:50,842
Like one time...

110
00:09:51,551 --> 00:09:53,720
...a little over four years ago...

111
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,265
...I saw what I thought was...

112
00:09:57,348 --> 00:09:59,350
...a large man...

113
00:09:59,476 --> 00:10:03,396
...come out of a copse of birch trees.
Not a stitch of clothing.

114
00:10:04,314 --> 00:10:06,357
He was about sixty yards away.

115
00:10:06,483 --> 00:10:09,819
And he starts sniffing the air,
you know, like a dog.

116
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:15,742
And then he looked straight at me,
and I swear he smelled me...

117
00:10:15,867 --> 00:10:20,330
...because he took off into the woods so fast
you'd swear he wasn't human.

118
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:21,956
Really?

119
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,167
- You never saw him again?
- No.

120
00:10:26,753 --> 00:10:29,088
But I feel him.

121
00:10:30,256 --> 00:10:33,134
And... I've found things.

122
00:10:33,218 --> 00:10:35,303
Some scat...

123
00:10:35,386 --> 00:10:38,264
...half-buried, like a cat's, only more human.

124
00:10:38,389 --> 00:10:42,852
Found a half-eaten rabbit with
what looked like a human cuspid tooth...

125
00:10:42,936 --> 00:10:46,981
...and deer bones, looked like
they'd been sharpened into tools.

126
00:10:47,065 --> 00:10:50,235
You think it's responsible
for the body you found?

127
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:53,696
Well...

128
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:56,866
I got a pension coming up in a few years.

129
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:00,870
You know, you say the wrong thing...
I'll tell you one thing.

130
00:11:01,037 --> 00:11:05,250
I don't ever come out here
without my weapon any more.

131
00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:09,379
How far is it into town from here?

132
00:11:10,046 --> 00:11:12,507
About a mile, a mile and a half.

133
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:16,094
I'm staying at the Galaxy Gateway
for a couple of days.

134
00:11:16,219 --> 00:11:19,430
- If you think of anything, will you call me?
- Sure.

135
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,776
Look at this gorilla outfit!

136
00:11:31,901 --> 00:11:34,779
Where am I? I can't see!

137
00:11:41,452 --> 00:11:43,496
It's OK. It's all right.

138
00:11:43,621 --> 00:11:46,124
What happened? Did you bump your head?

139
00:11:47,292 --> 00:11:49,335
Cruiser! Stop that!

140
00:11:51,254 --> 00:11:53,006
Go on.

141
00:11:53,131 --> 00:11:55,174
What happened?

142
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,886
- Jungle warfare.
- I could kill that dog.

143
00:11:57,969 --> 00:12:01,097
If the hit squad
doesn't get to him before you do.

144
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,266
I am so glad you're here, Dana.

145
00:12:03,349 --> 00:12:05,977
Hey! Get off me! Cruiser!

146
00:12:06,644 --> 00:12:09,105
Cruiser, get down!

147
00:12:20,199 --> 00:12:21,534
Oh!

148
00:12:21,659 --> 00:12:23,703
- You're amazing.
- What?

149
00:12:23,828 --> 00:12:27,373
You're a natural.
I don't know how you keep it together.

150
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:29,542
Mommy radar.

151
00:12:30,168 --> 00:12:32,587
I don't think I'm cut out for this, El.

152
00:12:32,670 --> 00:12:37,008
You went to the FBI Academy.
What better training for motherhood?

153
00:12:38,051 --> 00:12:41,512
Seriously. You're great with kids.
What do you mean?

154
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:45,183
- When do I find the time?
- First you have to get a life.

155
00:12:45,308 --> 00:12:47,810
Of course, it helps if you can find a man.

156
00:12:47,894 --> 00:12:51,022
- Know of any?
- They're disappearing faster...

157
00:12:51,147 --> 00:12:53,358
...than the Brazilian rainforest.

158
00:12:53,483 --> 00:12:56,319
- What about that guy you work with?
- Mulder?

159
00:12:56,402 --> 00:13:00,990
- I thought you said he was cute.
- He's a jerk. He's not a jerk. He's... um...

160
00:13:01,074 --> 00:13:03,076
He's obsessed with his work.

161
00:13:32,021 --> 00:13:34,482
Hi. I'm Rob. Scott's dad.

162
00:13:34,565 --> 00:13:37,610
- Oh! Come in.
- Thanks.

163
00:13:37,735 --> 00:13:39,112
Hey, tiger!

164
00:13:39,237 --> 00:13:42,657
How you doing?
You having a good time?

165
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,867
Divorced.

166
00:14:27,285 --> 00:14:29,787
Did anybody here know Roger Crockett?

167
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:34,959
He was murdered two days ago.

168
00:14:40,298 --> 00:14:41,466
Ma'am, can I...

169
00:14:44,844 --> 00:14:46,763
Roger Crockett?

170
00:14:46,846 --> 00:14:48,765
Anybody?

171
00:14:52,685 --> 00:14:54,771
What do you want to know?

172
00:14:54,854 --> 00:14:56,939
Did you know Roger Crockett?

173
00:14:57,023 --> 00:14:59,108
Did you hear how he died?

174
00:14:59,192 --> 00:15:01,319
Yeah.

175
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:04,197
Any ideas who might have done it?

176
00:15:04,822 --> 00:15:06,866
You a cop?

177
00:15:06,991 --> 00:15:09,035
No, I'm FBI.

178
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,663
I'll show you something.

179
00:15:12,789 --> 00:15:14,165
OK.

180
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:23,007
I need some money.

181
00:16:07,343 --> 00:16:10,847
- What is this?
- Stuck in the pocket of a jacket I found.

182
00:16:12,265 --> 00:16:14,350
Does it mean anything to you?

183
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:16,561
- I've seen it.
- Where?

184
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:19,522
- Right here, digging in the trash.
- Here?

185
00:16:19,897 --> 00:16:21,983
Are you hustling me?

186
00:16:22,066 --> 00:16:24,193
Swear to God.

187
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,821
- What do you think it is?
- I don't know.

188
00:16:26,904 --> 00:16:28,990
It scared the hell out of me.

189
00:16:29,073 --> 00:16:32,827
- Has anybody else seen it?
- Everybody's pretty freaked.

190
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:36,622
- Anybody told the cops?
- What, you think they don't know?

191
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:46,716
- Where are you sleeping tonight?
- You're standing in my bedroom.

192
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:49,218
You know the Galaxy Gateway?

193
00:16:50,553 --> 00:16:52,597
Room 756.

194
00:16:54,265 --> 00:16:56,309
Go ahead.

195
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,063
They got HBO?

196
00:17:01,939 --> 00:17:03,941
Yeah. They do.

197
00:19:35,718 --> 00:19:39,347
- We've got a man up on that roof.
- Nothing to be afraid of.

198
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:40,639
We can give you
a warm place to sleep it off.

199
00:19:40,723 --> 00:19:43,100
Hey! Back off!

200
00:19:43,225 --> 00:19:46,187
- There's a man up on that roof!
- Get in the car! Now!

201
00:19:53,444 --> 00:19:58,657
- What the hell are you doing?!
- Enjoying the nightlife here in Atlantic City.

202
00:19:58,783 --> 00:20:01,535
I'll go right to the DA's office if I have to.

203
00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:06,457
- Obstructing an investigation. Misconduct.
- Let's go see her together.

204
00:20:06,582 --> 00:20:10,586
- We could add "withholding evidence".
- What are you talking about?

205
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:14,757
Statements given to you
describing something stalking the city.

206
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:19,095
This is the fishing trip they get me up
at three in the morning for?

207
00:20:19,345 --> 00:20:20,721
Unbelievable!

208
00:20:20,805 --> 00:20:23,974
Why else would you
be sweeping the streets tonight?

209
00:20:24,058 --> 00:20:25,351
You know it's out there.

210
00:20:25,476 --> 00:20:27,520
I got a perpetrator out there.

211
00:20:27,645 --> 00:20:32,441
Whether it's Hannibal the Cannibal or
Elmer Fudd, I've got a job to protect people.

212
00:20:32,525 --> 00:20:37,446
Is that your job? Or is it to keep
the dice rolling? The tour buses rolling in?

213
00:20:37,530 --> 00:20:42,785
You can't fill those casinos, this town
disappears like a quarter down the slot.

214
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:45,454
I've seen it.

215
00:20:45,538 --> 00:20:47,665
Seen what?

216
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:04,807
You've been spending too much time
in supermarket checkout lines.

217
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,976
That story's as old as the hills.

218
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:11,981
Who's gonna be responsible
when you lose your first tourist, Detective?

219
00:21:12,064 --> 00:21:14,150
- You are.
- No, you are, sir.

220
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:18,821
Because you're wasting my time
and impeding the solution of this case.

221
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:21,407
You wanna go on a safari, go to Africa.

222
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:24,660
In the meantime,
enjoy the rest of your weekend.

223
00:21:37,882 --> 00:21:39,550
Agent Scully!

224
00:21:39,675 --> 00:21:41,719
Agent Mulder, line three.

225
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:46,140
Where are you?

226
00:21:46,223 --> 00:21:50,352
<i>- Not far from where you left me.</i>
- You're still in Atlantic City?

227
00:21:50,436 --> 00:21:53,689
<i>Scully, you got anything</i>
<i>happening this morning?</i>

228
00:21:53,772 --> 00:21:57,234
- What's that noise in the background?

229
00:21:59,945 --> 00:22:03,908
- That's a guy getting sick.
<i>- Mulder, where are you?</i>

230
00:22:04,033 --> 00:22:06,285
The drunk tank?

231
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:14,877
It's not hard to see
why they mistook you for a vagrant.

232
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:19,882
Are you gonna rag on me
or take me to get something to eat?

233
00:22:19,965 --> 00:22:22,676
Am <i>I</i> buying? Or did you manage
to panhandle some change

234
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,803
while you were at it?

235
00:22:24,929 --> 00:22:27,431
It moved like a cat. Quick and graceful.

236
00:22:27,556 --> 00:22:31,685
There's no way a human could've
gotten up on the roof that fast.

237
00:22:31,769 --> 00:22:33,854
- Mulder...
- What?

238
00:22:33,938 --> 00:22:36,482
What happens when word
gets to the Bureau?

239
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:39,652
They dropped the charges.
Thompson did it to spite me.

240
00:22:39,777 --> 00:22:44,573
- I'm talking about this Jersey Devil.
- It's exactly like the ranger described.

241
00:22:44,657 --> 00:22:47,117
The way it moved, sniffed the air...

242
00:22:47,243 --> 00:22:50,454
- It's probably in search of food.
- Yeah, I'll say!

243
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:54,500
It was in the garbage. If it was a man-eater,
why didn't it go for me?

244
00:22:54,625 --> 00:22:59,922
- It probably felt threatened.
- You've already given it a motive and alibi.

245
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:03,801
It chewed somebody's arm off.
Hardly a defensive posture.

246
00:23:03,926 --> 00:23:08,556
- You do believe I saw something?
- You saw <i>something,</i> I'll give you that.

247
00:23:08,639 --> 00:23:12,226
But I'm not about to go in and sell
a sighting in a dark alley.

248
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:17,690
- I've still got a hotel room I'm paying for.
- I have to get back to Washington by 7.30.

249
00:23:17,815 --> 00:23:20,943
- Got another birthday party?
- No.

250
00:23:21,819 --> 00:23:23,862
I have a date.

251
00:23:27,157 --> 00:23:29,285
Can you cancel?

252
00:23:30,202 --> 00:23:34,164
Unlike you, Mulder...
I would like to have a life.

253
00:23:34,498 --> 00:23:36,542
I have a life.

254
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:43,507
Come on. I have somebody
I want you to meet on the way home.

255
00:23:45,342 --> 00:23:49,513
Just about every culture has one.
Yeti, Sasquatch...

256
00:23:49,638 --> 00:23:51,640
...Russian almas, sonnequat.

257
00:23:51,724 --> 00:23:54,685
- Why is that?
- It's a universal wild-man myth.

258
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:59,898
A fear of our dual natures as humans,
as creators of life and destroyers of life.

259
00:24:00,024 --> 00:24:03,777
- What's this chart?
- It shows the historic entry of man...

260
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:07,740
...onto each continent,
and the effect on other species...

261
00:24:07,865 --> 00:24:11,035
- ..which, as you see, has been disastrous.
- Why?

262
00:24:11,243 --> 00:24:13,704
We humans have retained hereditary traits

263
00:24:13,787 --> 00:24:17,082
that have proven
to be extremely destructive.

264
00:24:17,333 --> 00:24:20,711
We tend to be tribal,
aggressively territorial...

265
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:24,214
...oriented by selfish sexual
and reproductive drives...

266
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:28,969
...that make co-operation beyond the family
or tribe extremely hard for us.

267
00:24:29,053 --> 00:24:31,764
We kill other species in order to survive?

268
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:34,558
Humans sit at the top of the food chain...

269
00:24:34,683 --> 00:24:37,895
...and we reduce other species'
chances of survival.

270
00:24:38,062 --> 00:24:41,065
I'm glad Dana left here
with more than a degree!

271
00:24:41,190 --> 00:24:44,109
What if something
entered the food chain above us?

272
00:24:44,234 --> 00:24:48,197
It won't happen.
Our intelligence virtually ensures that...

273
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:53,202
...barring the introduction of alien life,
we will live our days as rulers of the world.

274
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:56,246
But what if, by some fluke of nature...

275
00:24:56,372 --> 00:25:00,000
...a human was born who reverted
to its most animal instincts?

276
00:25:00,084 --> 00:25:01,877
A carnivorous Neanderthal.

277
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,588
Wouldn't he be above us on the food chain?

278
00:25:04,713 --> 00:25:09,093
Sure. All he'd have to do is wait
outside any fast-food restaurant...

279
00:25:09,218 --> 00:25:11,679
...and eat us on the way in.

280
00:25:11,762 --> 00:25:15,265
Haven't there been cases
of men raised in the wilderness...

281
00:25:15,391 --> 00:25:18,811
...by animals who have no language
and hunt like predators?

282
00:25:18,936 --> 00:25:21,146
Several. But cannibalism is rare.

283
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:25,025
- Even among the lower mammals.
- When faced with extinction?

284
00:25:25,109 --> 00:25:27,528
Maybe in the jungles of New Guinea...

285
00:25:27,611 --> 00:25:31,115
It's highly unlikely
that what you're suggesting...

286
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,201
...could have survived
in the woods of New Jersey.

287
00:25:34,284 --> 00:25:39,289
Highly unlikely, but not outside
the realm of extreme possibility?

288
00:25:41,250 --> 00:25:44,628
Well, it would be an amazing discovery.

289
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:24,918
The hard thing was
when my wife remarried.

290
00:26:25,002 --> 00:26:28,130
I felt very competitive
for my son's attention.

291
00:26:28,213 --> 00:26:30,299
- It was weird.
- I'm sure.

292
00:26:30,382 --> 00:26:33,343
I became a superdad
on the weekend with Scott.

293
00:26:33,469 --> 00:26:36,472
I had this unconscious fear
of being replaced.

294
00:26:36,555 --> 00:26:40,392
I had dreams where I was running
over his stepfather with my car.

295
00:26:41,852 --> 00:26:45,981
You'll understand when <i>you</i> have kids.
They change everything.

296
00:26:46,064 --> 00:26:48,358
That's what they say.

297
00:26:50,152 --> 00:26:53,697
Maybe some weekend
we could take the kids to the beach.

298
00:26:55,032 --> 00:26:58,160
- Yeah!
- Great.

299
00:26:58,243 --> 00:27:00,370
Thank you.

300
00:27:01,413 --> 00:27:04,708
Can I ask about the case you're on,
or can't you say?

301
00:27:08,545 --> 00:27:12,049
I don't think it's a case
we should discuss over dinner.

302
00:27:12,174 --> 00:27:17,179
I don't suppose you want to hear about the
finer points of estate planning and taxation?

303
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:37,366
Mulder.

304
00:27:37,449 --> 00:27:40,953
<i>This is Peter Brullet</i>
<i>of the Jersey Parks Department.</i>

305
00:27:41,078 --> 00:27:42,496
Oh, yeah. Hi.

306
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:44,957
I found a body out in the woods today,

307
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,626
<i>looks like it's been dead</i>
<i>six to eight months.</i>

308
00:27:47,751 --> 00:27:52,005
A long-haired male, missing
the same tooth I found in that rabbit.

309
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:54,758
- Could be your devil.
- Where's the body now?

310
00:27:54,883 --> 00:27:58,011
<i>- With the coroner's office.</i>
- You're sure it was a male?

311
00:27:58,095 --> 00:28:00,097
<i>It had all the plumbing.</i>

312
00:28:00,222 --> 00:28:02,391
Excuse me.

313
00:28:06,812 --> 00:28:08,939
I'm sorry.

314
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:14,736
Excuse me.

315
00:28:18,282 --> 00:28:21,076
- Scully.
<i>- Mulder.</i>

316
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:24,872
<i>- Sorry to interrupt your evening.</i>
- That's OK. What's up?

317
00:28:24,955 --> 00:28:27,666
I just had an amazing thought.

318
00:28:28,166 --> 00:28:31,670
Maybe it isn't a beast <i>man</i>
we're looking for, after all.

319
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:45,851
If they picked it up, nobody logged the body
on the chart. <i>I</i> sure haven't seen it.

320
00:28:45,976 --> 00:28:48,437
What else would they have done with it?

321
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,772
We may have called you for nothing.

322
00:28:50,856 --> 00:28:52,774
They're trying to sweep it under the carpet.

323
00:28:52,858 --> 00:28:54,192
Why?

324
00:28:54,318 --> 00:28:59,114
Any publicity, and the streets are crawling
with people who aren't playing crap tables.

325
00:28:59,197 --> 00:29:01,658
Word gets out it's on the loose, forget it.

326
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:04,703
- You said it was a female?
- The body was a male.

327
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:08,206
There's a chance there was a mate.
We have to find out.

328
00:29:08,332 --> 00:29:11,168
What are the chances of capturing it alive?

329
00:29:11,293 --> 00:29:15,005
If it <i>is</i> a primate,
it would have a natural fear of heights.

330
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:18,342
It would also want to stay close
to its food source.

331
00:29:18,550 --> 00:29:20,719
This thing has no fear of heights.

332
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:24,222
We'll stay together
and start with the lower floors.

333
00:29:24,348 --> 00:29:28,477
- How much time will that dart give us?
- It'll put down a bear for an hour.

334
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,479
If I hit it.

335
00:30:03,178 --> 00:30:06,848
- What's a park-ranger vehicle doing here?
- I don't know.

336
00:30:07,891 --> 00:30:10,394
Check it out.

337
00:30:12,604 --> 00:30:14,731
Run a check for me.

338
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:37,754
There's something here!

339
00:30:42,551 --> 00:30:45,887
It's blood.
She could be bringing her killing here.

340
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:48,932
She could be injured.

341
00:30:51,226 --> 00:30:53,729
Roger. Zebra Team in position.

342
00:31:31,933 --> 00:31:34,436
What if it <i>is</i> a female, Scully?

343
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:38,065
How close is she to you or me?

344
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:40,233
Does she feel emotion?

345
00:31:40,317 --> 00:31:43,361
Or are her days just spent...
looking for food?

346
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:47,491
Maybe she spends her day shopping.

347
00:31:49,993 --> 00:31:54,164
Eight million years out of Africa.
We're not all that different.

348
00:31:56,875 --> 00:32:01,630
We've put men into space. Built computers
that work faster than the human mind.

349
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:06,843
While we overpopulate the world and create
new technologies to kill each other with.

350
00:32:06,968 --> 00:32:09,554
Maybe we're just beasts with big brains.

351
00:32:11,515 --> 00:32:13,600
What?

352
00:32:13,683 --> 00:32:17,687
No, I was just... thinking about
my godson's birthday party.

353
00:32:18,855 --> 00:32:22,150
Eight little six-year-old boys
running around.

354
00:32:22,234 --> 00:32:24,194
Talk about primitive behaviour!

355
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:27,072
Mulder. He's a federal agent.
Ever hear of him?

356
00:32:27,197 --> 00:32:29,241
No.

357
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:33,411
- What are you doing here?
- I'm a professor of anthropology.

358
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:36,540
Mulder. That sound familiar?
I know he's here.

359
00:32:36,665 --> 00:32:40,919
Check upstairs, Andrew.
I want this place searched top to bottom.

360
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,347
Move! Move!

361
00:33:18,748 --> 00:33:20,792
Mulder!

362
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:24,254
Mulder, where are you?

363
00:36:41,493 --> 00:36:42,827
Mulder?!

364
00:36:46,414 --> 00:36:48,458
Scully!

365
00:36:52,003 --> 00:36:54,130
Lay back.

366
00:36:54,464 --> 00:36:56,591
Oh! Mulder, you're hurt!

367
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,386
You should have seen her.

368
00:36:59,469 --> 00:37:01,554
She was beautiful.

369
00:37:01,638 --> 00:37:04,099
She just about ripped your lungs out.

370
00:37:04,808 --> 00:37:09,562
She could have torn my head off, but
she didn't cos she sensed I wasn't a threat.

371
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:12,899
I need federal jurisdiction on this case.
Mulder!

372
00:37:12,982 --> 00:37:16,945
- How old would you say she was?
- The assistant DA's on the phone.

373
00:37:17,028 --> 00:37:19,322
He wants to know what the hell is going on.

374
00:37:19,406 --> 00:37:22,283
Tell him he's got
a Neanderthal on the loose.

375
00:37:22,367 --> 00:37:25,787
- She was young.
- The Crime Unit has filed a complaint...

376
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:28,873
...that we're endangering
a murder investigation.

377
00:37:28,998 --> 00:37:32,836
- That is such crap.
- They've got her cornered in a building.

378
00:37:34,712 --> 00:37:36,423
It crawled into the wall.

379
00:37:36,506 --> 00:37:38,842
- Can you get a man in there?
<i>- Affirmative.</i>

380
00:37:40,552 --> 00:37:43,680
- Keep these people out of here!
- Take her alive!

381
00:37:43,805 --> 00:37:46,433
What's going on in there?

382
00:37:46,516 --> 00:37:50,186
<i>I've got a man down! A naked woman</i>
<i>jumped from the second storey!</i>

383
00:37:50,311 --> 00:37:53,356
Suspect is headed south
into the woods on foot!

384
00:38:10,248 --> 00:38:13,334
I know these woods.
She'll be down by the rocks.

385
00:38:36,357 --> 00:38:38,401
Look.

386
00:38:41,446 --> 00:38:43,531
Can you reach her from here?

387
00:38:43,615 --> 00:38:45,742
I can try.

388
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:38,461
It tried to take my arm off.

389
00:40:13,621 --> 00:40:15,665
Why did you have to kill her?

390
00:40:17,834 --> 00:40:20,169
Same reason you kill a rabid animal.

391
00:41:02,211 --> 00:41:04,297
Hi. This just came through.

392
00:41:04,380 --> 00:41:07,717
It's a posthumous medical exam
of the woman's body.

393
00:41:07,842 --> 00:41:12,096
They found fragments of human bones
still in her digestive tract.

394
00:41:12,221 --> 00:41:14,891
They estimated her age to be 25 to 30 years.

395
00:41:15,016 --> 00:41:19,520
Now, they allowed Dr Diamond
to do a medical exam of the body...

396
00:41:19,604 --> 00:41:24,984
...but he found nothing that suggested
prehistoric bone structure or physiology.

397
00:41:25,068 --> 00:41:27,695
Now, the ACPD has her listed as a Jane Doe.

398
00:41:27,779 --> 00:41:32,700
A search for her identity in state
psychiatric records has begun in earnest.

399
00:41:32,784 --> 00:41:33,951
Good luck.

400
00:41:34,035 --> 00:41:36,537
They have also released the medical exam...

401
00:41:36,621 --> 00:41:39,040
...from the male body that they found.

402
00:41:39,123 --> 00:41:41,751
His age is estimated to be about 40 years.

403
00:41:42,752 --> 00:41:44,921
There would have been offspring.

404
00:41:45,088 --> 00:41:50,426
The medical exam of the woman's uterus
does indicate that she may have given birth.

405
00:41:50,551 --> 00:41:54,472
She was just protecting her children.
It all makes sense.

406
00:41:54,597 --> 00:41:57,684
The male dies
and she comes out in search of food.

407
00:41:57,767 --> 00:42:01,187
Mulder, do me a favour.
Go and have a beer. Take the day off.

408
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:04,399
I'll cover for you.
Just take some time for yourself.

409
00:42:04,482 --> 00:42:06,984
I've got an appointment
at the Smithsonian...

410
00:42:07,110 --> 00:42:10,279
- ..with an ethno-biologist.

411
00:42:11,739 --> 00:42:13,574
Mulder.

412
00:42:13,658 --> 00:42:17,161
Yeah, just a second. It's for you.

413
00:42:20,998 --> 00:42:23,835
- Hello?
<i>- Hi, Dana. It's Rob.</i>

414
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,336
Oh, hi.

415
00:42:25,461 --> 00:42:29,173
Sorry to call you at work,
but I have Scott for the night...

416
00:42:29,298 --> 00:42:34,595
...and we have tickets for <i>Cirque de Soleil.</i>
We thought you and Trent could join us.

417
00:42:40,017 --> 00:42:42,520
Requisition for a car, please.

418
00:42:43,146 --> 00:42:45,648
Thank you.

419
00:42:51,529 --> 00:42:53,614
Who was that on the phone?

420
00:42:53,698 --> 00:42:55,783
- A guy.
- A guy?

421
00:42:55,867 --> 00:42:58,077
Same guy you had dinner with?

422
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:01,497
- Same guy.
- Are you gonna have dinner with him again?

423
00:43:01,622 --> 00:43:03,666
- I don't think so.
- No interest?

424
00:43:03,791 --> 00:43:06,335
- Not at this time.
- Thanks, Fran.

425
00:43:08,171 --> 00:43:11,841
- What are you doing?
- Going with you to the Smithsonian.

426
00:43:11,966 --> 00:43:16,345
- Don't you have a life, Scully?
- I'll hurt you like that beast woman.

427
00:43:16,471 --> 00:43:18,681
Eight million years out of Africa.

428
00:43:18,806 --> 00:43:20,850
And look who's holding the door.

429
00:43:30,026 --> 00:43:32,737
- Dad, did you just see something?
- Where?

430
00:43:32,862 --> 00:43:35,323
- Over there.
- I'm sure it was nothing.

431
00:43:35,406 --> 00:43:39,452
- No, I saw something.
- Ever hear the story of the Jersey Devil?

432
00:43:39,535 --> 00:43:42,663
When I was a kid,
my dad used to tell this story...

433
00:43:42,747 --> 00:43:45,708
...about a creature
who lived out in the woods.

434
00:43:45,833 --> 00:43:47,877
It was half-man, half-animal.

435
00:43:48,002 --> 00:43:50,046
I used to believe that story.

436
00:44:09,899 --> 00:44:11,400
Sally Lewis

437
00:44:22,036 --> 00:44:23,913
<i>I made this!</i>
