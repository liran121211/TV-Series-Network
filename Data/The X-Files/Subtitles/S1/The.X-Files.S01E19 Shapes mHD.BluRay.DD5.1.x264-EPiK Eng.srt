1
00:02:54,092 --> 00:02:58,305
I'm not a killer.
And I never meant to hurt no one.

2
00:02:59,181 --> 00:03:02,601
But I'm tired of my cattle being butchered
a hundred miles from the slaughterhouse.

3
00:03:02,684 --> 00:03:04,478
That's the fourth one this month.

4
00:03:04,728 --> 00:03:06,855
Who or what do you think was responsible?

5
00:03:06,938 --> 00:03:10,734
That cow was like
a shredded piece of paper.

6
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:12,527
No animal could have done that.

7
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:16,823
Then are you saying that a person,
or persons, was responsible for this?

8
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:21,870
I want to remind you that
Mr Parker is free on bond, pending trial.

9
00:03:21,953 --> 00:03:25,123
He's speaking with you
solely in regards to <i>this</i> incident...

10
00:03:25,207 --> 00:03:27,918
...and not about any other pending litigation.

11
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:32,089
So we can't talk about his court case
against the Trego Indian Reservation?

12
00:03:32,172 --> 00:03:33,882
That's exactly what I mean.

13
00:03:33,965 --> 00:03:36,426
- Wait a damn second!
- Jim, don't say a word.

14
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:39,846
Forget that lawyer crap.
I wanna get this out in the open!

15
00:03:40,389 --> 00:03:42,349
You think I killed an Indian...

16
00:03:42,432 --> 00:03:47,896
- ..just because we're arguing about land!
- We wanna settle that peacefully, in court.

17
00:03:48,146 --> 00:03:52,150
Well, Joseph Goodensnake is dead
with a wound from your shotgun.

18
00:03:53,777 --> 00:03:57,155
All I'm saying,
it was no kind of animal that I know of.

19
00:03:58,156 --> 00:04:00,367
It damn well didn't seem human neither!

20
00:04:00,492 --> 00:04:02,536
Take a look at my boy's scars.

21
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:06,998
It was dark.

22
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:10,502
We heard a growl.
We went out to protect the cattle.

23
00:04:10,585 --> 00:04:12,671
I could've swore I saw...

24
00:04:13,422 --> 00:04:15,507
...red eyes and fangs.

25
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:20,595
I thought my boy Lyle was...

26
00:04:22,597 --> 00:04:25,058
Look, nobody, <i>nobody...</i>

27
00:04:25,183 --> 00:04:29,938
...was more shocked and upset than I was
to find out it was that young Indian boy.

28
00:04:30,021 --> 00:04:31,940
But if he killed our cattle...

29
00:04:32,023 --> 00:04:35,819
...I'm very, very sorry that
we had to find out about it that way.

30
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:38,572
But as far as I'm concerned,
that's the end of it!

31
00:04:40,031 --> 00:04:43,201
- Can we see the corral?
- I'll take you out there.

32
00:04:47,581 --> 00:04:49,291
- Agent Mulder?
- Yeah?

33
00:04:49,374 --> 00:04:51,042
Agent Scully?

34
00:04:51,126 --> 00:04:54,296
I suppose if I were hearin'
our side of the story...

35
00:04:54,379 --> 00:04:56,715
...it might not hold up too well.

36
00:04:57,549 --> 00:05:03,180
Parts of it I don't understand myself, things
my father could never explain to a stranger.

37
00:05:03,263 --> 00:05:05,640
What kinds of things?

38
00:05:06,558 --> 00:05:10,770
For the last few months, whenever we'd
go out at night and check on the cattle...

39
00:05:10,896 --> 00:05:12,522
...we never saw anything
out of the ordinary -

40
00:05:12,606 --> 00:05:14,983
not a mountain lion, not a coyote.

41
00:05:15,066 --> 00:05:18,153
Not even any Tregos, Agent Scully.

42
00:05:20,906 --> 00:05:22,991
But I could feel it...

43
00:05:23,074 --> 00:05:25,160
...something not human...

44
00:05:25,952 --> 00:05:28,121
...out there...

45
00:05:28,246 --> 00:05:30,290
...watching me.

46
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:34,252
The air was more still...

47
00:05:34,336 --> 00:05:36,671
...and the night animals more quiet.

48
00:05:37,422 --> 00:05:40,509
It was like nature herself was terrified.

49
00:05:41,426 --> 00:05:43,887
It gave me the creeps.

50
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,222
The creeps?

51
00:05:45,305 --> 00:05:47,098
Yeah.

52
00:05:47,182 --> 00:05:50,602
The creeps. Don't you ever get the creeps?

53
00:06:00,612 --> 00:06:02,697
The victim was shot there.

54
00:06:03,448 --> 00:06:06,326
About three metres from where Parker fired.

55
00:06:07,327 --> 00:06:11,248
There's no way he could have
mistaken a person for an animal.

56
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:13,458
It's open and shut, Mulder.

57
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:19,047
You know, I'm surprised
you volunteered for this assignment.

58
00:06:19,798 --> 00:06:23,385
Any Bureau agent could have
investigated this homicide.

59
00:06:23,468 --> 00:06:25,470
Why are you interested?

60
00:06:51,413 --> 00:06:55,166
Well, there seems to be nothing
unexplainable about this case.

61
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,960
Nope.

62
00:06:57,043 --> 00:06:59,170
Not a thing.

63
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:08,430
Mulder, this is so odd. It's almost like
a snakeskin that's been shed.

64
00:07:08,513 --> 00:07:12,350
I suspect the Parkers killed Goodensnake,

65
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:14,603
but they don't seem the type
to skin their victim.

66
00:07:14,686 --> 00:07:18,648
Besides which, police and coroner's report
make no mention of it.

67
00:07:18,732 --> 00:07:22,193
We're going to have to
take a look at the body ourselves.

68
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,238
The body's with
the reservation authorities.

69
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:27,657
We're supposed to get in touch with, uh...

70
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:29,868
...Sheriff Charlie Tskany.

71
00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:15,538
Excuse me, we're not from around here.
We're looking for Sheriff Tskany.

72
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:25,924
Anyone know Charlie Tskany?

73
00:08:26,883 --> 00:08:29,427
Go home, FBI.

74
00:08:31,304 --> 00:08:33,598
How'd you know?

75
00:08:33,682 --> 00:08:36,059
I could smell you a mile away.

76
00:08:36,142 --> 00:08:39,396
They told me that even though
my deodorant is for a woman,

77
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,356
it's strong enough for a man.

78
00:08:46,277 --> 00:08:49,489
I was at Wounded Knee in 1973.

79
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:53,660
And what I learned fighting the FBI is...

80
00:08:53,743 --> 00:08:57,622
...you don't believe in us...
and we don't believe in you.

81
00:08:58,748 --> 00:09:00,834
I want to believe.

82
00:09:02,669 --> 00:09:06,339
Why are you here?
What are you looking for?

83
00:09:06,423 --> 00:09:08,758
You already know what we're looking for.

84
00:09:08,842 --> 00:09:12,303
- You tell me what I know.
- We're looking for any individuals...

85
00:09:12,387 --> 00:09:15,098
...who have information on the homicide of...

86
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:18,935
We're looking for anything
that can create human tracks in one step...

87
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:21,312
...and animal tracks in the next.

88
00:09:22,647 --> 00:09:24,065
Parker...

89
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,943
He found what you're looking for.

90
00:09:27,026 --> 00:09:30,071
He killed what you're looking for, FBI.

91
00:09:30,488 --> 00:09:33,074
What Parker and his kid killed
was my brother!

92
00:09:33,158 --> 00:09:37,370
And you're all too afraid of some stupid
Indian legend to do anything! I hate it!

93
00:09:37,454 --> 00:09:38,580
Gwen!

94
00:09:38,663 --> 00:09:42,500
I hate suits who are here when they
want something, but if we need help...

95
00:09:43,835 --> 00:09:45,920
...they're nowhere to be found.

96
00:09:52,093 --> 00:09:54,179
Sheriff Tskany?

97
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:58,767
I'm Agent Scully and this is Agent Mulder.

98
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:02,687
Goodensnake's body is in my office.

99
00:10:22,207 --> 00:10:23,458
Bill, Tom...

100
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:26,252
...let 'em through.

101
00:10:27,545 --> 00:10:29,631
Come on, boys, let 'em through.

102
00:10:37,722 --> 00:10:40,683
- Who are they?
- Guardians of the dead.

103
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:44,062
They escort the deceased spirits
to the new world.

104
00:10:45,146 --> 00:10:47,649
I only let them as far as the front door.

105
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:51,611
I keep the ancient beliefs out there
and the police work in here.

106
00:10:51,736 --> 00:10:55,824
The woman in the pool hall said that
people were afraid of some Indian legend.

107
00:10:55,907 --> 00:10:58,243
What do they believe about the Parker case?

108
00:10:58,326 --> 00:11:02,205
I'm not a park ranger here
to answer all your questions about Indians.

109
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:05,333
Whenever I need federal help, I never get it!

110
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:11,506
Since this case falls under the jurisdiction of
the FBI, you're entitled to examine the body.

111
00:11:12,674 --> 00:11:14,759
So let's get it over with.

112
00:11:19,973 --> 00:11:23,142
- Was the woman in the pool hall his sister?
- Gwen.

113
00:11:23,268 --> 00:11:28,106
She and Joe were primarily responsible for
fuelling the boundary dispute with Parker.

114
00:11:28,189 --> 00:11:32,569
They felt that he'd been grazing his cattle
too far onto the reservation.

115
00:11:32,652 --> 00:11:35,905
Parker probably told you
he wanted to settle in court...

116
00:11:35,989 --> 00:11:38,157
...but Joe and Gwen filed the suit.

117
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:43,162
Take a look at that scar tissue.

118
00:11:43,288 --> 00:11:44,581
Yeah.

119
00:11:44,664 --> 00:11:47,125
Looks like an animal attack as well.

120
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:49,627
Could Joe have been attacked?

121
00:11:50,587 --> 00:11:53,965
- Maybe the Parkers <i>did</i> see an animal.
- No.

122
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:57,468
Those wounds have been healing
for quite some time.

123
00:11:57,594 --> 00:12:00,889
The shotgun wound
indicates point-blank range.

124
00:12:00,972 --> 00:12:03,975
The pellets entered the body
in a single mass.

125
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:07,896
The assailant couldn't have been
more than three feet away.

126
00:12:07,979 --> 00:12:11,065
We need to take a look at
Joe Goodensnake's dental records.

127
00:12:26,623 --> 00:12:29,334
These are the canine cuspids.
They're normal.

128
00:12:29,417 --> 00:12:32,253
Maybe his records
were switched or misplaced.

129
00:12:32,337 --> 00:12:36,090
The second incisor is chipped,
just like the ones in his mouth.

130
00:12:36,174 --> 00:12:38,259
These match Joe Goodensnake's.

131
00:12:38,343 --> 00:12:43,514
There are cases of calcium phosphate salts
developing abnormally with age, but...

132
00:12:43,598 --> 00:12:48,186
That could account for what Jim Parker
claims to have seen. He was out that night...

133
00:12:48,311 --> 00:12:53,942
...expecting to see a mountain lion. He gets
rattled and the flashlight catches Joe here.

134
00:12:54,025 --> 00:12:56,694
So Parker saw what he wanted to see -
an animal.

135
00:12:56,778 --> 00:13:01,115
Lyle was attacked. He has scars just like
Joe. Is there a facility where we can...

136
00:13:01,199 --> 00:13:03,284
- ..perform an autopsy?
- Why?

137
00:13:03,368 --> 00:13:04,827
If his teeth are abnormal,

138
00:13:04,911 --> 00:13:08,873
an autopsy might reveal
abnormalities in his internal anatomy.

139
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,835
I can't allow that.

140
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:26,057
- I'm fully qualified.
- No, I can't let you do an autopsy.

141
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:30,228
- The funeral is tonight.
- It's a cremation. Then we'll have nothing.

142
00:13:30,353 --> 00:13:34,983
The Tregos believe that the recent dead are
unsettled by their new condition as spirits.

143
00:13:35,066 --> 00:13:39,821
Any desecration of the body angers the
spirit and keeps it haunting this world.

144
00:13:39,904 --> 00:13:42,991
But as a law enforcement officer,
you can't destroy evidence.

145
00:13:43,074 --> 00:13:45,493
Don't tell me what I can't do.

146
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:50,081
Native Americans believe there are laws
greater than that of the US Government.

147
00:13:50,206 --> 00:13:52,041
If they want Joe at rest,

148
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:55,253
rather than used as a piece of evidence,
that's how it's gonna be.

149
00:13:55,336 --> 00:14:00,550
If you want to make an issue out of it,
you're a higher authority, go right ahead.

150
00:14:01,175 --> 00:14:02,844
Charlie?

151
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:07,598
Do you believe that the spirit of
Joe Goodensnake is in that room?

152
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:14,022
All I know is...

153
00:14:14,105 --> 00:14:16,190
...tomorrow, the day after...

154
00:14:16,274 --> 00:14:18,443
...you're gonna leave.

155
00:14:18,526 --> 00:14:20,862
But I have to stay here.

156
00:14:20,945 --> 00:14:23,197
I've gotta answer to these people.

157
00:14:24,282 --> 00:14:29,037
You can continue your investigation,
but without Joe Goodensnake's body.

158
00:14:57,774 --> 00:14:59,817
Mulder, since we've been here...

159
00:14:59,942 --> 00:15:04,238
...you've acted as if you've expected to find
all the evidence that we've come across.

160
00:15:04,322 --> 00:15:07,158
What aren't you telling me?

161
00:15:07,241 --> 00:15:09,243
Why are we here?

162
00:15:12,121 --> 00:15:14,165
A true piece of history, Scully.

163
00:15:16,918 --> 00:15:22,757
The very first X-File.
Initiated by J Edgar Hoover himself in 1946.

164
00:15:25,259 --> 00:15:29,430
In World War Il, a series of murders
occurred in the Northwest,

165
00:15:29,514 --> 00:15:30,932
seven here in Browning.

166
00:15:31,015 --> 00:15:36,104
Each victim was basically ripped to shreds
and eaten as if by a wild animal.

167
00:15:36,187 --> 00:15:41,943
However, many of the victims were found at
home, as if they allowed their killer to enter.

168
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:48,950
In 1946, police cornered what they
believed to be such an animal in a cabin...

169
00:15:49,033 --> 00:15:51,369
...in Glacier National Park.

170
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:53,204
They shot it.

171
00:15:53,287 --> 00:15:55,748
But when they went in
to retrieve the carcass,

172
00:15:55,832 --> 00:15:58,376
they found only the body
of Richard Watkins.

173
00:15:58,501 --> 00:16:02,797
- Sounds like the Parker scenario.
- The murders stopped that year.

174
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,300
Because the cases were unsolved
and considered so bizarre...

175
00:16:06,384 --> 00:16:10,221
...Hoover locked them away,
hoping that they would be forgotten.

176
00:16:10,972 --> 00:16:15,143
This file indicates that
they started again in 1954.

177
00:16:15,226 --> 00:16:18,479
And '59, '64, '78...

178
00:16:18,563 --> 00:16:20,815
...and now again in '94.

179
00:16:20,898 --> 00:16:23,901
- But...
- Here it comes.

180
00:16:23,985 --> 00:16:28,406
...these animal-man related murders
predate the oldest X-File by 150 years.

181
00:16:28,531 --> 00:16:32,410
Members of the Lewis and Clark expedition
wrote of Indian men...

182
00:16:32,535 --> 00:16:34,662
...who could change into a wolf.

183
00:16:37,039 --> 00:16:41,252
Mulder, what this... what this folder
describes is called lycanthropy.

184
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:43,754
It's a type of insanity in which...

185
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:47,383
...an individual believes
that he can turn into a wolf.

186
00:16:47,884 --> 00:16:49,927
I mean, no one...

187
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:52,680
...can physically change into an animal!

188
00:17:02,106 --> 00:17:05,943
What about the evidence?
Tracks in the mud, the shredded skin...

189
00:17:06,027 --> 00:17:09,530
- ..a man with the teeth of an animal.
- Even if you're right...

190
00:17:09,614 --> 00:17:15,203
...and Joe Goodensnake did have the ability
to transform physically into an animal...

191
00:17:15,286 --> 00:17:18,623
...he's dead! Jim Parker shot him...

192
00:17:18,748 --> 00:17:21,709
...and in a couple of moments
his body will be burned.

193
00:17:22,877 --> 00:17:25,546
End of mystery.

194
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:28,174
Let's hope so.

195
00:17:47,944 --> 00:17:49,987
You don't belong here.

196
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:54,283
- Gwen...
- You're only around to wrap up your case.

197
00:17:57,662 --> 00:18:01,165
I just wanted to say that
I'm sorry about your brother.

198
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:05,169
I feel sad for anyone
who loses a part of their family.

199
00:18:05,253 --> 00:18:07,421
A part?

200
00:18:07,505 --> 00:18:09,590
He <i>was</i> my whole family.

201
00:18:11,259 --> 00:18:13,344
I'm it now.

202
00:18:16,347 --> 00:18:18,516
As a demonstration of sorrow...

203
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,187
...I'm supposed to give away
all my brother's possessions.

204
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:29,193
Gwen, I don't know what to say.

205
00:18:29,318 --> 00:18:31,362
- Um...
- It's no big deal.

206
00:18:32,947 --> 00:18:35,825
He had more possessions
than he had friends.

207
00:19:02,018 --> 00:19:05,479
I read the report of your investigation
into the Goodensnake homicide.

208
00:19:05,563 --> 00:19:06,897
It was very good.

209
00:19:07,023 --> 00:19:09,066
It was thorough, professional.

210
00:19:10,318 --> 00:19:12,862
But what I want to know is off the record.

211
00:19:14,322 --> 00:19:16,574
What do you think really happened?

212
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:21,078
Your explanation, Agent Mulder,
is lying on that burial platform.

213
00:19:21,203 --> 00:19:23,914
Why don't you just accept that
and go home?

214
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:30,171
Charlie, do you believe in shape-shifting?

215
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:32,340
This is a funeral.

216
00:21:33,002 --> 00:21:35,963
- Get out of here!
- Please, I want to show my respects.

217
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:40,301
I don't want your respects!
I want your heart to grow cold.

218
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:42,678
I want you to feel what I'm feeling!

219
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,643
I think you'd better leave, Mr Parker.

220
00:21:52,730 --> 00:21:57,234
I wish your brother could be here.
I wish that more than anything else.

221
00:24:16,123 --> 00:24:20,461
The body's been mutilated. I'd say
he's been attacked by a large predator.

222
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:23,047
Or somebody wanted it to look that way.

223
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,300
Do you think this is retaliation
for Joe Goodensnake?

224
00:24:26,383 --> 00:24:28,886
I don't know.

225
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:33,807
Have you talked to Gwen Goodensnake?
She seemed pretty upset last night.

226
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:38,854
She's gone. Nobody's seen her since
the funeral. I've put an APB out on her.

227
00:24:40,064 --> 00:24:42,149
And what about Lyle Parker?

228
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:44,985
We can't find him either.

229
00:24:45,069 --> 00:24:47,154
He could be dead as well.

230
00:24:49,198 --> 00:24:51,241
I'll take a look around.

231
00:26:17,327 --> 00:26:20,581
That's not from any animal I've ever seen.

232
00:26:20,664 --> 00:26:23,500
Sheriff, I think it's time we had a talk.

233
00:26:25,794 --> 00:26:27,838
An exchange of ideas?

234
00:26:27,963 --> 00:26:29,840
Mulder!

235
00:26:34,762 --> 00:26:37,514
Mulder, I'm taking Lyle to the hospital.

236
00:26:42,853 --> 00:26:45,189
He's suffering from exposure.

237
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:47,608
When he's been checked out,
I'm going to question him.

238
00:26:57,785 --> 00:26:59,870
What are you hiding?

239
00:27:00,954 --> 00:27:03,040
- I thought it was over.
- Over?

240
00:27:03,123 --> 00:27:07,127
Is that why you wouldn't allow an autopsy
on Joe Goodensnake's body?

241
00:27:07,211 --> 00:27:10,047
You thought it would all end
when he was cremated?

242
00:27:10,130 --> 00:27:12,466
What were you afraid we'd find?

243
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:14,802
I can't tell you...

244
00:27:14,885 --> 00:27:17,721
...but I'll take you to somebody who can.

245
00:27:33,654 --> 00:27:37,699
I'm ashamed to say it
after what happened at the funeral.

246
00:27:39,243 --> 00:27:43,038
I picked up some bourbon
and I don't remember a thing after that.

247
00:27:47,584 --> 00:27:52,756
When I'm down, I go out to where we keep
stray animals that wander in on the ranch.

248
00:27:54,049 --> 00:27:57,594
I just watch 'em, you know.
It keeps things in perspective.

249
00:27:59,429 --> 00:28:01,098
Anyway...

250
00:28:02,099 --> 00:28:07,521
...my mom, when she was alive, was the one
that started keeping those animals.

251
00:28:07,604 --> 00:28:10,440
I guess I go out there
and think about her too.

252
00:28:12,901 --> 00:28:16,864
God, I must have been really wasted
to run around there naked.

253
00:28:17,447 --> 00:28:20,409
I must have thought
I was one of those animals.

254
00:28:23,412 --> 00:28:27,624
When you did go home,
did you talk to your father?

255
00:28:28,876 --> 00:28:31,795
No, he'd have been mad
I even went to the funeral.

256
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:34,214
I...

257
00:28:34,298 --> 00:28:36,383
I have an image of him...

258
00:28:38,093 --> 00:28:40,470
...sitting on the front porch, but...

259
00:28:40,596 --> 00:28:42,973
...I don't remember talking to him. Why?

260
00:28:45,392 --> 00:28:47,477
Your father's dead.

261
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:54,484
I'm sorry.

262
00:29:01,408 --> 00:29:03,493
It appears as if he's been...

263
00:29:04,828 --> 00:29:06,914
...attacked by an animal, but...

264
00:29:07,831 --> 00:29:10,292
...I suspect it may be homicide.

265
00:29:10,959 --> 00:29:15,339
Lyle... I lost my father recently
and I know how overwhelming...

266
00:29:15,422 --> 00:29:17,507
Was it my fault?

267
00:29:21,428 --> 00:29:25,641
By going to the funeral,
did it anger them into killing my father?

268
00:29:27,517 --> 00:29:29,186
I don't know.

269
00:29:32,689 --> 00:29:38,278
I can deal with death, you know. Livin'
on the ranch, being close to nature and all...

270
00:29:38,862 --> 00:29:44,660
...you see how it all works. Things are born,
things die. Everything else falls in-between.

271
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:51,375
But if I caused it...

272
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:54,670
If I brought it on...

273
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:57,631
I couldn't... I...

274
00:30:14,564 --> 00:30:16,858
I saw it once with my own eyes.

275
00:30:19,069 --> 00:30:21,154
It was a long time ago.

276
00:30:21,238 --> 00:30:23,323
It seemed like a dream.

277
00:30:23,991 --> 00:30:26,076
I was a boy.

278
00:30:26,827 --> 00:30:28,912
Was that 1946?

279
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:31,081
The Watkins case?

280
00:30:32,332 --> 00:30:34,418
I sense you are different, FBI.

281
00:30:34,501 --> 00:30:39,089
You're more open to Native American belief
than some Native Americans.

282
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:45,345
You even have an Indian name.

283
00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:47,431
Fox.

284
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:51,268
You should be "Running Fox"
or "Sneaky Fox".

285
00:30:52,602 --> 00:30:55,022
Just as long as it's not "Spooky Fox".

286
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:59,401
Now tell me, Ish, what did you see?

287
00:31:02,946 --> 00:31:05,699
Watkins had been attacked by an animal...

288
00:31:07,284 --> 00:31:09,411
...when he was alone in the woods.

289
00:31:11,455 --> 00:31:14,291
His scars healed. It was forgotten.

290
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:16,752
Then... the murders began.

291
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:20,213
The Tregos...

292
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:26,553
...we realised that Watkins had been
attacked by what the Algonquians call...

293
00:31:26,636 --> 00:31:28,722
...the manitou.

294
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:34,978
An evil spirit capable of
changing a man into a beast.

295
00:31:36,813 --> 00:31:41,651
To be attacked by a manitou
causes the victim to become one.

296
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:45,822
The healed scars
on Joe Goodensnake's body.

297
00:31:45,947 --> 00:31:48,909
The manitou overtakes a man by night...

298
00:31:48,992 --> 00:31:51,411
...not by full moon...

299
00:31:51,495 --> 00:31:55,499
...but when its blood lust
builds to uncontrollable level...

300
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:58,335
...the man changes to a sickening creature.

301
00:31:59,252 --> 00:32:03,298
It kills, releasing a savage energy.

302
00:32:04,925 --> 00:32:07,844
The man returns to his true self...

303
00:32:07,928 --> 00:32:10,639
...unaware of what has happened.

304
00:32:12,015 --> 00:32:14,768
The cycle begins anew the next day.

305
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:18,355
This continues until death.

306
00:32:19,773 --> 00:32:21,441
One night...

307
00:32:21,525 --> 00:32:24,027
...when I was 16 years old...

308
00:32:25,195 --> 00:32:28,865
...I was coming back from fishing
at the Cut Bank Creek.

309
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:31,618
I knew a short cut behind Watkins' house.

310
00:32:33,662 --> 00:32:35,956
There was a... a groan...

311
00:32:37,374 --> 00:32:39,126
...not animal...

312
00:32:39,209 --> 00:32:41,294
...but not human.

313
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:44,548
I looked into his window.

314
00:32:45,715 --> 00:32:47,884
He was covered in sweat and blood.

315
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:52,472
He was in a great...

316
00:32:52,556 --> 00:32:54,641
...great pain.

317
00:32:58,395 --> 00:33:00,522
His arm, the skin ripped...

318
00:33:02,732 --> 00:33:04,985
...it tore off and fell to the floor.

319
00:33:06,069 --> 00:33:08,405
Claws sprang from his fingernails.

320
00:33:09,364 --> 00:33:11,408
He turned, screaming...

321
00:33:13,410 --> 00:33:15,495
...and he saw me.

322
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:17,664
His eyes...

323
00:33:18,498 --> 00:33:21,168
His eyes were still human.

324
00:33:21,251 --> 00:33:23,378
They begged me to kill him.

325
00:33:24,546 --> 00:33:29,551
If I had been hunting and had my gun,
I'd have done it without a second thought.

326
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,512
But being a boy...

327
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:36,016
...and scared to death...

328
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:38,602
...I ran away.

329
00:33:38,685 --> 00:33:41,104
Shortly after, the police killed him.

330
00:33:41,229 --> 00:33:43,440
But the manitou rose again.

331
00:33:44,774 --> 00:33:47,444
Eight years later.

332
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:51,907
But with Watkins dead, how could there
have been an attack by a manitou?

333
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:55,243
Watkins had a son.

334
00:33:56,703 --> 00:33:59,122
It can be passed along bloodlines.

335
00:33:59,206 --> 00:34:00,790
Gwen!

336
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:05,545
If Joe Goodensnake was this creature...

337
00:34:05,629 --> 00:34:09,049
...perhaps it didn't originate in him
by the first attack...

338
00:34:09,132 --> 00:34:11,718
...but was handed down
through the bloodlines.

339
00:34:11,801 --> 00:34:14,804
Gwen could have it also.
Gwen could have killed Parker.

340
00:34:38,495 --> 00:34:40,163
Gwen!

341
00:34:41,164 --> 00:34:42,666
Hey!

342
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,797
Agh! No! No! No!

343
00:34:51,258 --> 00:34:54,427
You're under arrest, Gwen,
for stealing Ish's car!

344
00:34:56,179 --> 00:34:58,640
What are you running away from?

345
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:00,934
I saw it!

346
00:35:01,017 --> 00:35:03,645
I... I saw it kill Parker.

347
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:06,273
Let her up.

348
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:14,447
I went there... after the funeral.

349
00:35:15,115 --> 00:35:17,200
I was gonna mess up the kid...

350
00:35:17,284 --> 00:35:19,536
...so I waited...

351
00:35:19,661 --> 00:35:22,163
...but Parker was on the porch.

352
00:35:23,206 --> 00:35:25,292
And then this thing...

353
00:35:25,375 --> 00:35:28,211
...this animal... Oh, my God!

354
00:35:29,379 --> 00:35:32,382
I've never been so scared.

355
00:35:32,465 --> 00:35:34,843
I ran and I hid in the woods all day!

356
00:35:35,885 --> 00:35:39,180
I wanted to get out!
I wanted to get outta here!

357
00:35:39,806 --> 00:35:42,559
I wanted to get outta here!

358
00:35:42,684 --> 00:35:44,352
Bring her inside.

359
00:35:58,158 --> 00:35:59,492
Thank you.

360
00:35:59,576 --> 00:36:01,661
Hello, this is Dr Joseph.

361
00:36:01,745 --> 00:36:06,499
This is Agent Mulder, FBI. I was told
I could reach Agent Scully at this number.

362
00:36:06,583 --> 00:36:11,004
Oh, yes. We released Lyle Parker
and she's taking him back to the ranch.

363
00:36:11,087 --> 00:36:13,757
- I can reach her there?
<i>- Uh-huh. They just left.</i>

364
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:18,094
Agent Mulder,
there's something you should know.

365
00:36:18,219 --> 00:36:22,349
I received the blood test performed on Lyle.
Something's rather unsettling.

366
00:36:22,432 --> 00:36:23,683
What's that?

367
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:28,229
Traces of his father's blood type.
It can only be there through ingestion.

368
00:37:13,608 --> 00:37:16,403
- The power's out.
- It happens to us all the time...

369
00:37:16,486 --> 00:37:20,281
...being out here in the sticks.
I'll fire up the generator.

370
00:37:23,785 --> 00:37:25,829
Are you OK?

371
00:37:25,954 --> 00:37:28,998
I feel sick. Please, help me
into the bathroom.

372
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:44,931
Damn! It keeps disconnecting.
The mountains must be blocking the signal.

373
00:37:45,014 --> 00:37:47,600
- How much farther?
- About seven miles.

374
00:37:52,522 --> 00:37:55,275
Lyle? Let me come in.

375
00:37:56,693 --> 00:38:00,697
Lyle, I want to take you
back to the hospital, OK?

376
00:38:00,822 --> 00:38:02,615
No!

377
00:38:02,699 --> 00:38:04,784
I'll be all right.

378
00:38:14,794 --> 00:38:16,546
Lyle?

379
00:38:16,629 --> 00:38:18,047
Lyle, answer me.

380
00:38:19,174 --> 00:38:21,217
Lyle, are you all right?

381
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:04,886
Argh!

382
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,960
Scully!

383
00:41:22,065 --> 00:41:24,150
- Agh!
- It's OK, it's me.

384
00:41:24,233 --> 00:41:28,738
It's me. I don't know what happened.
Something jumped me downstairs.

385
00:41:28,863 --> 00:41:31,366
- I lost my gun.
- I heard it come up here.

386
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:34,077
- Come on.
- OK.

387
00:42:41,310 --> 00:42:43,438
Argh!

388
00:42:47,817 --> 00:42:49,944
Are you all right?

389
00:42:55,450 --> 00:42:56,784
Oh, my God!

390
00:42:57,994 --> 00:43:00,079
He was in the bathroom, sick.

391
00:43:00,163 --> 00:43:03,583
The next thing I knew
we were attacked by the mountain lion.

392
00:43:03,666 --> 00:43:08,004
<i>- </i> It wasn't the mountain lion.
<i>- </i> It's still in the cage out back.

393
00:43:28,816 --> 00:43:32,612
Where's Gwen?
She said she'd come see us before we left.

394
00:43:32,695 --> 00:43:36,949
She left last night. Gave away
all her possessions to her friends.

395
00:43:37,033 --> 00:43:39,869
She just pulled up and left?
Why would she do that?

396
00:43:39,994 --> 00:43:44,540
Her brother's gone, no family,
the trouble with Parker is all over.

397
00:43:44,665 --> 00:43:49,337
Maybe she saw something
that she wasn't ready to understand.

398
00:43:52,006 --> 00:43:53,341
Maybe.

399
00:43:58,054 --> 00:44:00,139
Well, thank you.

400
00:44:10,233 --> 00:44:11,901
FBI!

401
00:44:14,070 --> 00:44:18,074
See you in about... eight years.

402
00:44:18,157 --> 00:44:20,535
I hope not.

403
00:44:45,518 --> 00:44:50,398
Helen Stewart

404
00:45:17,633 --> 00:45:19,302
<i>I made this!</i>
