1
00:01:51,822 --> 00:01:53,699
Eugene?

2
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,035
Eugene, it's Dr Monte.

3
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:06,378
Eugene, are you asleep?

4
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,548
No.

5
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:11,633
I was on my way out.

6
00:02:11,717 --> 00:02:14,845
I wanted to stop by and see
how you were feeling.

7
00:02:15,637 --> 00:02:17,306
Fine.

8
00:02:18,932 --> 00:02:20,559
Good.

9
00:02:20,642 --> 00:02:22,728
You nervous about tomorrow?

10
00:02:24,062 --> 00:02:26,231
Don't be.

11
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:30,819
I know you think they won't let you out,
so I peeked at the reports...

12
00:02:30,902 --> 00:02:34,072
...of the doctors that will
testify at your review.

13
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:38,243
They concur with my opinion
that you're ready to be released...

14
00:02:38,368 --> 00:02:39,995
Mm.

15
00:02:40,078 --> 00:02:42,080
...and rejoin the community.

16
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:43,707
So...

17
00:02:46,752 --> 00:02:49,504
...why don't we get some sleep and relax...

18
00:02:49,588 --> 00:02:52,591
...and I'll see you tomorrow
at the review, OK?

19
00:02:59,097 --> 00:03:01,600
Let's just keep our fingers crossed.

20
00:04:12,295 --> 00:04:14,339
Agent Scully...

21
00:04:14,423 --> 00:04:18,176
...we have reviewed your reports
and frankly we are displeased.

22
00:04:18,301 --> 00:04:21,346
Irregular procedure, untenable evidence...

23
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:26,393
...anonymous witnesses, inconclusive
findings aggravated by vague opinion.

24
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,482
The nature of X-Files cases often
precludes orthodox investigation.

25
00:04:32,983 --> 00:04:36,862
Do you suggest we adopt separate
standards for you and Mulder?

26
00:04:36,945 --> 00:04:38,113
No.

27
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:41,616
Does Agent Mulder obstruct you
from proper procedure?

28
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:47,706
No, sir. I'm suggesting these cases
be reviewed with an open mind.

29
00:04:47,831 --> 00:04:51,376
Maybe your mind has become too open.

30
00:04:51,501 --> 00:04:55,046
On cases investigated
by Mulder and myself to date...

31
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:58,133
...we have a conviction
or case solution of 75%...

32
00:04:58,216 --> 00:05:00,218
...well above Bureau standard.

33
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:02,387
That is your only saving grace.

34
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:06,558
May I ask, sir, what more you require?

35
00:05:11,313 --> 00:05:15,734
What I require is
increased frequency of reports...

36
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:18,320
...conventional investigation.

37
00:05:18,403 --> 00:05:21,823
In short, Agent Scully,
it is your responsibility...

38
00:05:21,907 --> 00:05:24,576
...to see that these cases are by the book.

39
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:27,078
I understand. However...

40
00:05:29,247 --> 00:05:32,501
...conventional investigation
of these cases...

41
00:05:32,584 --> 00:05:35,879
...may decrease the rate of success.

42
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,764
By order...

43
00:05:45,889 --> 00:05:49,017
...of the State of Maryland,
the court shall review...

44
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:54,022
...the psychological status
of Eugene Victor Tooms.

45
00:05:54,105 --> 00:05:58,109
We'll begin with
the court-appointed expert witnesses.

46
00:05:58,193 --> 00:06:00,195
The court calls...

47
00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:02,781
...Dr Pamela Karetzky.

48
00:06:06,368 --> 00:06:09,913
I performed several diagnostic
procedures on Mr Tooms...

49
00:06:09,996 --> 00:06:14,709
...in order to determine any organic
physiological dysfunction.

50
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:17,379
An electroencephalogram...

51
00:06:17,462 --> 00:06:21,466
...chromosomal analysis,
a computerised axial tomograph.

52
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,676
All of these were negative.

53
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:24,844
"Mr Tooms had recently lost his job...

54
00:06:30,892 --> 00:06:34,062
"Aggravated by a false arrest by the FBI...

55
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:36,439
...his assault on Agent Scully was...

56
00:06:36,523 --> 00:06:39,693
...'frustration directed at the wrong person'."

57
00:06:39,776 --> 00:06:43,363
I am reading from a recent interview
I did with Mr Tooms...

58
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:45,532
...at the Druid Hill Sanitarium.

59
00:06:45,615 --> 00:06:50,704
If you were released,
what is the first thing you would do?

60
00:06:50,787 --> 00:06:55,375
- I'd like my old job back.
- Why?

61
00:06:55,458 --> 00:06:59,546
The animal shelter made me
feel I was helping everyone...

62
00:06:59,629 --> 00:07:01,715
...people and animals.

63
00:07:03,133 --> 00:07:06,553
Mr Tooms has learned
to articulate his feelings...

64
00:07:06,636 --> 00:07:12,517
...and invest his emotional energy
and creative energy in...

65
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:24,654
...stratagems he can build up in himself.

66
00:07:24,738 --> 00:07:27,657
It is my opinion that Mr Tooms...

67
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:31,578
...has had an excellent response
to the treatment and therapy.

68
00:07:31,661 --> 00:07:34,289
I would see no reason
why he would be any danger...

69
00:07:34,372 --> 00:07:37,125
...to himself or any member of society.

70
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:41,713
Do you swear your testimony is the truth,
the whole truth and nothing but the truth?

71
00:07:41,963 --> 00:07:43,423
I do.

72
00:07:45,967 --> 00:07:50,013
Mr Mulder, as an expert witness
for the State of Maryland...

73
00:07:50,096 --> 00:07:51,536
...can you list your qualifications?

74
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:54,684
I'm a special agent with the FBI.

75
00:07:54,768 --> 00:07:57,937
I worked for three years
at its behavioural science unit...

76
00:07:58,021 --> 00:07:59,564
...profiling serial killers.

77
00:07:59,773 --> 00:08:02,984
Your Honour,
I know where he's going with this.

78
00:08:03,068 --> 00:08:05,612
Mr Tooms was placed in psychiatric care...

79
00:08:05,695 --> 00:08:07,947
...solely for the assault on Agent Scully.

80
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:11,326
He has never been charged
with any other crime.

81
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:14,537
You may proceed... with caution.

82
00:08:14,621 --> 00:08:17,582
Agent Mulder, I understand...

83
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:21,211
...you've drawn on your experience
to profile Mr Tooms.

84
00:08:21,294 --> 00:08:24,130
- Yes, I have.
- Please.

85
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:29,427
These murders span nearly a century.

86
00:08:29,511 --> 00:08:33,848
19 homicides, five occurring
every 30 years since 1903.

87
00:08:33,932 --> 00:08:36,434
All in the Baltimore area.

88
00:08:38,311 --> 00:08:40,980
In each case, the liver was extracted...

89
00:08:41,064 --> 00:08:43,149
...and presumably eaten.

90
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,945
A trophy was taken from each victim,
many of which were found...

91
00:08:47,028 --> 00:08:50,740
...in the living quarters
of Eugene Tooms at 66 Exeter Street.

92
00:08:50,949 --> 00:08:56,162
Records show that a Eugene Tooms has
resided at that same address since 1903...

93
00:08:56,246 --> 00:08:59,457
...the same year a man
was murdered in that building.

94
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,710
Besides liver extraction...

95
00:09:01,793 --> 00:09:05,505
...the most notable link
is the undetermined point of entry.

96
00:09:05,588 --> 00:09:10,260
Many victims were found with their
windows and doors locked from the inside.

97
00:09:10,343 --> 00:09:15,265
These elongated fingerprints
found at 7 of the 19 crime scenes...

98
00:09:15,348 --> 00:09:17,100
...match Tooms.

99
00:09:17,183 --> 00:09:20,311
Agent Mulder, look at his fingers.

100
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:24,607
- Look at <i>him.</i>
- Perhaps through a genetic mutation...

101
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:28,319
...Eugene Tooms is capable
of elongating his body...

102
00:09:28,403 --> 00:09:31,448
...to access victims
so he may extract the livers...

103
00:09:31,531 --> 00:09:34,826
...which provide sustenance for
the hibernation period of 30 years.

104
00:09:35,076 --> 00:09:37,620
- He needs one more victim.
- Your Honour!

105
00:09:37,704 --> 00:09:40,290
An exam done at the time of his arrest...

106
00:09:40,373 --> 00:09:43,251
...revealed muscle and bone abnormalities.

107
00:09:43,334 --> 00:09:45,920
- His attorney blocked further study.
- Thank you!

108
00:09:46,004 --> 00:09:49,340
- Counsel?
- No further questions, Your Honour.

109
00:09:49,424 --> 00:09:52,343
- This an abnormal human creature.
- Agent Mulder!

110
00:09:52,427 --> 00:09:54,804
You may step down.

111
00:09:54,888 --> 00:09:59,017
If you release Tooms, he will kill again.
It's in his genetic make-up.

112
00:10:09,402 --> 00:10:13,239
Think they'd have taken me more seriously
if I wore the grey suit?

113
00:10:15,784 --> 00:10:18,661
Mulder, your testimony, you sounded so...

114
00:10:18,745 --> 00:10:21,206
I don't care as long as it was the truth.

115
00:10:21,289 --> 00:10:24,083
Where were <i>you?</i>

116
00:10:24,167 --> 00:10:28,213
- Your testimony was important.
- I was called into a meeting.

117
00:10:28,296 --> 00:10:32,550
- By Assistant Director Skinner.
- What did <i>he</i> want?

118
00:10:35,053 --> 00:10:37,180
He just wanted to reel me in.

119
00:10:39,599 --> 00:10:41,643
They're ready.

120
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:43,853
It is the opinion of this court...

121
00:10:43,937 --> 00:10:45,980
...that Eugene Victor Tooms...

122
00:10:46,064 --> 00:10:50,026
...shall on this day be released
from the Druid Hill Sanitarium.

123
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:52,946
The court also attaches these conditions.

124
00:10:53,029 --> 00:10:54,447
One...

125
00:10:54,531 --> 00:10:58,326
...that he remain in counselling
under the care of Dr Aaron Monte...

126
00:10:58,493 --> 00:11:04,415
...that he retain his job at Baltimore
Animal Shelter, and last...

127
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:09,212
...that he take residence in the house of
Mr and Mrs Arlan Green, trained...

128
00:11:09,295 --> 00:11:13,550
...to assist patients from Druid Hill
in their transition to society.

129
00:11:15,301 --> 00:11:17,387
Mr Tooms...

130
00:11:18,221 --> 00:11:21,516
...do you understand and accept
these conditions?

131
00:11:21,599 --> 00:11:23,393
Yes, Your Honour.

132
00:11:23,476 --> 00:11:25,895
Very well. You're free to go.

133
00:11:29,065 --> 00:11:31,901
- I'm not taking my eyes off him.
- Mulder...

134
00:11:31,985 --> 00:11:36,197
He'll kill the first chance he can,
but he won't kill the old couple.

135
00:11:36,281 --> 00:11:40,201
Tooms didn't remain a secret
for 100 years by not being careful.

136
00:11:40,285 --> 00:11:43,371
He'll only kill out of necessity
or self-defence.

137
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:45,039
If he makes an attempt, I'll stop him.

138
00:11:45,123 --> 00:11:46,583
I'll keep surveillance with you.

139
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:52,338
<i>I'll</i> watch him. Go back to the earlier
murders to prove it was him.

140
00:11:52,422 --> 00:11:56,342
- That was 30 or 60 years ago.
- Murder has no statute of limitation.

141
00:11:56,509 --> 00:12:00,471
Mulder, that's going to entail
unorthodox methods of investigation.

142
00:12:00,555 --> 00:12:05,184
If you're resistant because
you don't believe, I'll respect that.

143
00:12:05,268 --> 00:12:07,937
If it's because of bureaucratic pressure...

144
00:12:08,021 --> 00:12:11,232
...they've reeled you in <i>and</i> skinned you.

145
00:12:23,661 --> 00:12:26,915
<i>I hope you'll</i>
<i>be comfortable, Eugene.</i>

146
00:12:26,998 --> 00:12:29,083
<i>The room in the back is small...</i>

147
00:12:29,167 --> 00:12:32,670
<i>..but I'm sure you'll be able to squeeze in.</i>

148
00:12:32,754 --> 00:12:34,839
<i>I'm sure.</i>

149
00:13:57,005 --> 00:14:01,634
Excuse me...
could you help me find my dog?

150
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:05,555
He's a Norwegian elkhound.

151
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:08,224
His name is Heinrich.

152
00:14:08,307 --> 00:14:10,643
I use him to hunt moose.

153
00:14:30,621 --> 00:14:32,665
If Tooms gets away now...

154
00:14:32,790 --> 00:14:35,334
...then the next time he takes a life...

155
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,670
...you'll be nearly my age.

156
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:41,382
Detective Briggs,
you helped us so much before.

157
00:14:43,217 --> 00:14:47,346
Now we have to prove that Tooms
was involved in the killings...

158
00:14:47,472 --> 00:14:49,599
...you investigated 30 years ago.

159
00:14:49,682 --> 00:14:51,934
You've lived with this case...

160
00:14:52,018 --> 00:14:54,062
...half your life.

161
00:14:54,145 --> 00:14:58,900
There must be something... maybe
a connection between the victims.

162
00:14:58,983 --> 00:15:01,861
I know we've seen all the evidence...

163
00:15:01,944 --> 00:15:05,156
...but is there anything, anything at all...

164
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:07,575
...amongst the evidence that does not fit?

165
00:15:07,658 --> 00:15:09,702
There was something...

166
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:13,498
...that never did sit quite right with me.

167
00:15:13,581 --> 00:15:17,335
All of the victims that I investigated in '63...

168
00:15:17,418 --> 00:15:22,882
...were found at the crime scene,
liver extracted - all five.

169
00:15:23,007 --> 00:15:25,510
As were the four most recent murders.

170
00:15:25,593 --> 00:15:28,221
When I was a sheriff...

171
00:15:28,346 --> 00:15:32,308
...during the Pohattan Mills
killings of 1933...

172
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:36,312
...only four of the victims
were found at the crime scene.

173
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:39,148
However, there was a fifth person...

174
00:15:39,232 --> 00:15:41,984
...who was missing and never found.

175
00:15:42,068 --> 00:15:43,903
But this...

176
00:15:44,028 --> 00:15:47,448
This was discovered
at the Ruxton chemical plant...

177
00:15:47,532 --> 00:15:49,992
...when it was under construction.

178
00:15:50,076 --> 00:15:52,662
It doesn't belong to the other victims.

179
00:15:52,745 --> 00:15:56,541
That doesn't prove it belongs to
a person murdered by Tooms.

180
00:15:56,624 --> 00:15:59,502
I'm positive Tooms hid this one victim...

181
00:15:59,585 --> 00:16:02,964
...because something about the body
could prove he was the killer.

182
00:16:03,047 --> 00:16:07,718
- What makes you positive?
- A hunch. An old-fashioned hunch.

183
00:16:07,802 --> 00:16:10,346
You've got to trust your instincts.

184
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:16,310
And... what does your instinct say
about where Tooms buried the body?

185
00:16:16,394 --> 00:16:19,689
In the cement
where they poured the foundation...

186
00:16:19,772 --> 00:16:22,233
...of the chemical plant.

187
00:16:30,992 --> 00:16:33,494
Ground-penetrating radar.

188
00:16:33,578 --> 00:16:36,789
It bounces signals off objects or cavities.

189
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:38,916
Tells you where the body is.

190
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:42,295
Well, it signals if something
inordinate is present.

191
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:46,090
An experienced operator
attempts to differentiate...

192
00:16:46,174 --> 00:16:49,719
...if a signal is a body or a stone
or a hole in the ground.

193
00:16:49,802 --> 00:16:52,471
- Differentiates?
- Mm-hm.

194
00:16:52,597 --> 00:16:54,599
You mean he guesses.

195
00:16:54,682 --> 00:16:57,185
Well, it's an educated guess.

196
00:16:57,268 --> 00:16:59,353
Mm-hm.

197
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,362
How are we doing?

198
00:17:08,446 --> 00:17:11,115
Well, it's really hard to tell.

199
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,826
There are some possibilities.

200
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:17,371
Nothing very conclusive...

201
00:17:34,972 --> 00:17:37,016
It's here!

202
00:17:37,141 --> 00:17:39,185
Here!

203
00:17:39,977 --> 00:17:42,021
What is it?

204
00:17:42,146 --> 00:17:44,649
It's here!

205
00:17:44,732 --> 00:17:46,400
Right here!

206
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:39,245
Agent Scully, look at this.

207
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:04,455
Robo-toddler's finally sleeping!

208
00:20:04,538 --> 00:20:06,624
I'm gonna watch TV in bed.

209
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,210
OK.

210
00:21:38,466 --> 00:21:40,551
I'm coming, honey.

211
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:02,239
Oh, screw it!

212
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:40,588
Would you go down and get that?

213
00:23:46,093 --> 00:23:47,720
FBI.

214
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:50,139
I suspect an intruder in your house.

215
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:51,890
What?

216
00:23:57,104 --> 00:23:59,189
Someone opened my window!

217
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:37,311
I suspect the year of death
to be in the mid-1930s.

218
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:39,438
The anterior surface...

219
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:43,692
...of the right femur was green,
indicating exposure to copper.

220
00:24:43,776 --> 00:24:48,072
We concentrated on the area
and we found several pennies.

221
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:56,246
1933... '31... 1933.

222
00:24:56,330 --> 00:24:58,499
Can you determine cause of death?

223
00:24:58,582 --> 00:25:01,251
My instinct says burial in cement is murder.

224
00:25:01,335 --> 00:25:05,673
No, at the moment I have found
no definite proof of murder.

225
00:25:05,923 --> 00:25:08,175
There are gnawing marks near the ribs.

226
00:25:08,258 --> 00:25:10,219
I suspect that's rodent activity...

227
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:12,888
...prior to the body being set in cement.

228
00:25:12,971 --> 00:25:16,350
We need to see more of the remains
for cause of death.

229
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:19,520
As you know, it's a slow
but necessary process.

230
00:25:19,603 --> 00:25:21,647
I did try a little something.

231
00:25:21,772 --> 00:25:25,234
It's a little premature
if we're gonna go by the book.

232
00:25:25,317 --> 00:25:27,569
Well, we'll keep it off the record.

233
00:25:27,653 --> 00:25:29,488
Good. Thank you.

234
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:31,615
The old man, Mr Briggs...

235
00:25:31,699 --> 00:25:34,910
...gave me a photograph
of the missing person in 1933...

236
00:25:34,993 --> 00:25:37,663
...suspected of being a murder victim.

237
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:41,792
I ran a computer-aided superimposition
on what we have of the skull.

238
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:45,379
Now... this is not official...

239
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:50,134
...but that skeleton <i>was</i> that person.

240
00:25:50,551 --> 00:25:53,053
It's not enough. It doesn't tie it to Tooms.

241
00:25:54,722 --> 00:25:56,807
Well, it's a start.

242
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:03,313
Mulder, it's getting a bit ripe
in here, don't you think?

243
00:26:10,154 --> 00:26:12,239
Pine-scented!

244
00:26:14,158 --> 00:26:15,826
Ohh!

245
00:26:18,412 --> 00:26:20,414
Better?

246
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:25,127
Tooms hasn't come out of the house all day.

247
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:28,756
I've sat through a Phillies game
and four hours of Baba Booey.

248
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:32,468
When it got dark, I took a walk.
Got that sandwich I asked for?

249
00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:34,511
Mm.

250
00:26:35,721 --> 00:26:37,848
It's liverwurst.

251
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:45,314
You know proper surveillance
requires two pairs of agents...

252
00:26:45,397 --> 00:26:48,066
...one pair relieving the other after 12 hours.

253
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:50,110
Article 30, paragraph 8.7?

254
00:26:50,194 --> 00:26:54,698
This isn't about doing it by the book.
You haven't slept for three days.

255
00:26:54,782 --> 00:26:59,411
You're gonna get sloppy and
you're gonna get hurt. It's inevitable.

256
00:26:59,536 --> 00:27:03,415
A request for other agents
to stake out Tooms would be denied.

257
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,459
Then I'll stay, you go home.

258
00:27:08,712 --> 00:27:11,799
They're out to put an end
to the X-Files, Scully.

259
00:27:11,882 --> 00:27:15,052
I don't know why, but any excuse will do.

260
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:17,137
I don't really care about <i>my</i> record...

261
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:20,557
...but you'd be in trouble
just sitting in this car.

262
00:27:20,641 --> 00:27:25,103
I'd hate to see you carry an official
reprimand in your file because of me.

263
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:28,732
Fox...

264
00:27:30,984 --> 00:27:34,404
I... I... even made my parents
call me Mulder.

265
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:38,116
Mulder.

266
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:42,496
Mulder, I wouldn't put myself
on the line for anybody but you.

267
00:27:47,835 --> 00:27:50,254
If there's an iced tea in that bag...

268
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:52,256
...it could be love.

269
00:27:57,594 --> 00:27:59,680
Must be fate, Mulder.

270
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:04,726
Root beer.

271
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:09,481
You're delirious.
Go home and get some sleep.

272
00:28:09,606 --> 00:28:12,067
Take my sandwich. I only had one bite.

273
00:28:12,150 --> 00:28:14,194
You're gonna want it later.

274
00:28:14,278 --> 00:28:18,156
Call me if anything happens.
Immediately. I'll be here.

275
00:28:18,282 --> 00:28:21,326
Oh, oh, and 11.30, station 790...

276
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:24,788
...Pete Rose's late-night
sports talk radio show.

277
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:35,632
I wouldn't miss it for the world

278
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:14,838
<i>It has worked, hasn't it?</i>

279
00:29:17,716 --> 00:29:20,177
<i>You'll be all right now.</i>

280
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,512
<i>I know it's worked!</i>

281
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:09,453
Yeah, they found him out cold in the street.

282
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:11,788
He's been beaten up pretty badly.

283
00:31:11,872 --> 00:31:14,791
Contusions, multiple lacerations.

284
00:31:15,834 --> 00:31:18,920
The shoulder's been pulled right out of joint.

285
00:31:19,004 --> 00:31:22,549
Let's get him prepped
for some blood work and X-rays.

286
00:31:25,385 --> 00:31:27,429
He's been kicked in the jaw.

287
00:31:27,512 --> 00:31:30,640
It may be fractured.
There's a partial shoe print.

288
00:31:32,684 --> 00:31:34,728
I wanna get a photo of that.

289
00:31:34,811 --> 00:31:38,398
We might be able to find
the shoe that matches it later.

290
00:31:39,816 --> 00:31:41,860
Do you know who did this to you?

291
00:31:56,541 --> 00:31:58,668
We'll be right back, Mr Tooms.

292
00:32:05,217 --> 00:32:08,303
Says it was
an FBI agent named Mulder.

293
00:32:08,386 --> 00:32:12,307
So would you say he's delusional
or just schizophrenic?

294
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:16,603
It's just a cursory exam,
but there's nothing to indicate that.

295
00:32:37,249 --> 00:32:39,376
- Agent Mulder?
- Yeah.

296
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:48,093
What's going on?

297
00:32:58,562 --> 00:33:00,564
What's this about?

298
00:33:00,647 --> 00:33:02,732
Agent Mulder, get your things.

299
00:33:03,775 --> 00:33:05,902
You're in some trouble.

300
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:33,930
These are serious allegations.
The evidence is incriminating.

301
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:40,270
A good forensic scientist would know
there is not only a shoe print...

302
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:43,565
...but an impact point of the foot
from inside the shoe.

303
00:33:43,648 --> 00:33:46,401
An analysis of Tooms's injury would show...

304
00:33:46,484 --> 00:33:48,653
...my foot was not inside the shoe.

305
00:33:48,778 --> 00:33:51,448
Are you suggesting Tooms is framing you?

306
00:33:51,531 --> 00:33:56,703
- Of course.
- If you had him under surveillance...

307
00:33:56,786 --> 00:34:00,040
...how could he gain access
to your shoe without you seeing him?

308
00:34:00,123 --> 00:34:01,208
- Well...
- Sir.

309
00:34:01,291 --> 00:34:06,338
I was engaged in the unauthorised
surveillance as well.

310
00:34:06,630 --> 00:34:09,549
Agent Mulder was orienting me...

311
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:13,887
...on the situation at the time
Tooms was admitted into the hospital.

312
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:17,557
Agent Mulder could not have done it
because he was with me.

313
00:34:17,641 --> 00:34:21,311
Agent Scully, you wouldn't be
lying to me, would you?

314
00:34:21,436 --> 00:34:26,566
Sir, I would expect you to place
the same trust in me as I do in you.

315
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:30,445
Agent Scully, may I have a word
with Agent Mulder, please?

316
00:34:42,290 --> 00:34:43,959
Fox...

317
00:34:47,003 --> 00:34:50,340
...you were one of the finest,
most unique agents...

318
00:34:50,465 --> 00:34:53,969
...in the nearly 60-year history
of this institution.

319
00:34:54,052 --> 00:34:57,597
We were talking about you
when you were in the academy.

320
00:34:57,681 --> 00:35:01,726
Most of us, including the director,
feel you are wasted on the X-Files.

321
00:35:01,851 --> 00:35:06,314
But we respect that you are
deeply invested in those areas.

322
00:35:06,398 --> 00:35:09,567
But if these cases are creating such stress...

323
00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:11,814
...as to cause not only you
to act inappropriately...

324
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:13,863
...but agents close to you...

325
00:35:14,447 --> 00:35:16,950
...then may I advise you to step away...

326
00:35:17,033 --> 00:35:19,119
...for a while?

327
00:35:19,202 --> 00:35:22,122
Clear your head, take an extended vacation.

328
00:35:22,205 --> 00:35:24,374
That's a good idea.

329
00:35:24,499 --> 00:35:26,543
Thanks for your concern.

330
00:35:42,517 --> 00:35:45,312
You're forbidden to go near Eugene Tooms.

331
00:35:49,149 --> 00:35:51,026
Mulder...

332
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:54,070
...this was close.

333
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:58,658
Any closer and 1,000 friends at the
Capitol won't be able to help you.

334
00:36:03,747 --> 00:36:06,249
These are Eugene Tooms's dental X-rays...

335
00:36:06,374 --> 00:36:09,252
...obtained from the Druid Hill Sanitarium.

336
00:36:09,336 --> 00:36:12,255
Your sandwich the other night
gave me an idea.

337
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:15,216
Dr Plith had mentioned that he found
gnawing on the rib cage...

338
00:36:15,675 --> 00:36:18,094
...near the location of the liver.

339
00:36:19,512 --> 00:36:21,681
Further excavation revealed...

340
00:36:21,765 --> 00:36:25,060
...more pronounced bite marks,
human teeth marks.

341
00:36:25,143 --> 00:36:28,688
Tooms will never voluntarily
submit to a dental cast.

342
00:36:28,772 --> 00:36:32,150
This software can create
a three-dimensional model...

343
00:36:32,233 --> 00:36:35,362
...of Tooms's mouth
from the dental radiograph.

344
00:36:43,453 --> 00:36:48,041
We've also mapped out the bite marks
from the skeleton's rib - here.

345
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:55,090
They match.

346
00:37:09,687 --> 00:37:11,731
Eugene, Dr Monte.

347
00:37:11,815 --> 00:37:15,443
Hi, I wanted to stop by and see
how everything was going.

348
00:37:15,527 --> 00:37:17,487
Susan and I are going out for the evening.

349
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,864
- See you later.
- Thanks.

350
00:37:21,658 --> 00:37:23,701
Great place.

351
00:37:23,785 --> 00:37:27,122
Wonderful place. How are you feeling?

352
00:37:45,515 --> 00:37:50,019
Why the newspaper strips, Eugene?
Are you making some <i>papier-mâché?</i>

353
00:37:50,145 --> 00:37:52,188
Yes.

354
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:55,024
That's terrific, wonderful.

355
00:37:55,150 --> 00:37:58,111
I had no idea you were interested in art.

356
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,449
I like art.

357
00:38:02,532 --> 00:38:05,034
I do, too. I'm very proud of you.

358
00:38:05,326 --> 00:38:07,454
Art can provide a window...

359
00:38:07,537 --> 00:38:10,123
...to your thoughts and your feelings.

360
00:38:10,874 --> 00:38:12,959
What are you doing, Eugene?

361
00:38:13,042 --> 00:38:15,545
Eugene... are you all right?

362
00:38:17,797 --> 00:38:19,549
Arghhhh!

363
00:39:07,013 --> 00:39:09,098
That makes five.

364
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:17,440
He's building his nest.

365
00:39:17,524 --> 00:39:20,360
- 30-year hibernation.
- Where would he go?

366
00:39:20,443 --> 00:39:23,530
Where he's gone for the last 90 years -
66 Exeter Street.

367
00:39:23,613 --> 00:39:27,116
No, I already checked.
They tore down that apartment building.

368
00:39:27,242 --> 00:39:28,660
What's there now?

369
00:39:32,914 --> 00:39:34,791
Thanks.

370
00:39:41,339 --> 00:39:42,966
He's gotta be here.

371
00:39:43,049 --> 00:39:45,969
If he's drawn to this location
for some reason...

372
00:39:46,052 --> 00:39:50,473
...maybe this nest is in the approximate
location of the previous nest.

373
00:39:54,477 --> 00:39:56,479
This is the area.

374
00:39:56,604 --> 00:39:58,648
There's a storage facility...

375
00:39:58,731 --> 00:40:00,817
...on the second floor.

376
00:40:15,582 --> 00:40:17,458
What?

377
00:40:28,845 --> 00:40:31,139
There's only room for one.

378
00:40:32,348 --> 00:40:34,475
You can get the next mutant.

379
00:41:36,245 --> 00:41:38,539
Mulder?

380
00:42:25,128 --> 00:42:26,796
Mulder?

381
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:45,732
Mulder! Mulder, here!

382
00:42:45,815 --> 00:42:47,650
Quick, grab my hand!

383
00:42:49,068 --> 00:42:51,654
- Come on!

384
00:42:54,574 --> 00:42:57,160
- Mulder, what's happening?

385
00:43:00,788 --> 00:43:02,623
Quick!

386
00:43:42,872 --> 00:43:44,999
Have you read this report?

387
00:43:48,628 --> 00:43:50,713
Do you believe them?

388
00:43:55,051 --> 00:43:57,053
Of course I do.

389
00:44:09,649 --> 00:44:11,651
OK, let's go.

390
00:44:11,734 --> 00:44:14,570
It's amazing how things change, isn't it?

391
00:44:15,488 --> 00:44:18,157
The caterpillar?

392
00:44:18,241 --> 00:44:20,159
No, a change for us.

393
00:44:20,243 --> 00:44:24,038
- It's coming.
- How do you know?

394
00:44:26,874 --> 00:44:28,918
A hunch.

395
00:44:48,729 --> 00:44:50,773
