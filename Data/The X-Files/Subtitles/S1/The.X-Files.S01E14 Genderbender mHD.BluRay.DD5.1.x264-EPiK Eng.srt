1
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:06,878
Oh, my... God!

2
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:09,673
That was... That was incredible!

3
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:13,260
I mean it.

4
00:02:14,303 --> 00:02:16,179
You don't believe me.

5
00:02:17,806 --> 00:02:19,891
Can you hear me?

6
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:23,687
Hey, I don't even know your name.

7
00:02:39,328 --> 00:02:40,996
Aghh...!

8
00:04:35,402 --> 00:04:40,907
Man calls his wife to say good night, goes
out, meets a chippy, brings her here for sex.

9
00:04:40,991 --> 00:04:44,578
- Beyond that, nothing makes a lot of sense.
- How's that?

10
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:49,374
Security monitor records the victim
entering the room with a woman at 10.13.

11
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:52,377
Same monitor
records a male leaving after midnight.

12
00:04:52,461 --> 00:04:54,546
Couldn't she have changed clothes?

13
00:04:54,629 --> 00:04:59,342
Male is definitely a different person.
Short hair and at least 30lbs heavier.

14
00:04:59,426 --> 00:05:04,598
The video never recorded his entry,
nor the chippy ever leaving.

15
00:05:04,681 --> 00:05:06,933
30 floors up. No other means of egress.

16
00:05:07,017 --> 00:05:11,062
- Did the doctor establish a cause of death?
- Guy blew an artery.

17
00:05:11,146 --> 00:05:13,315
Must have been some roll in the hay!

18
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,489
Hard to imagine, this day and age,
someone having sex with a stranger.

19
00:05:20,572 --> 00:05:22,741
Any sign of robbery?

20
00:05:22,824 --> 00:05:28,038
The male exited wearing the victim's suit,
carrying a suitcase. Wallet's gone.

21
00:05:28,121 --> 00:05:31,082
I don't know why we got this call
in the first place.

22
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:36,963
Really? Somebody at the Bureau put out
a request for any case involving this COD.

23
00:05:37,047 --> 00:05:39,591
- I assumed it was...
- Thanks for the call.

24
00:05:42,886 --> 00:05:46,848
Five deaths. Four in
the last six weeks between here and Boston.

25
00:05:46,932 --> 00:05:49,893
In each case
the victim dies in the throes of passion.

26
00:05:49,976 --> 00:05:52,729
Two women and three men,
including the last one.

27
00:05:52,812 --> 00:05:57,025
- All young, healthy adults.
- With symptoms of massive coronary arrest.

28
00:05:57,108 --> 00:06:00,779
- Is there a new drug on the streets?
- The oldest drug. Not even illegal.

29
00:06:00,862 --> 00:06:04,115
Each body showed the presence of
huge amounts of pheromones.

30
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:07,702
The chemicals animals secrete?
You mean sexual attractants?

31
00:06:07,786 --> 00:06:11,289
Radar love,
only 100 times stronger than found in nature.

32
00:06:11,373 --> 00:06:14,751
Strong enough to produce
anaphylactic shock or a coronary.

33
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:17,754
So you think somebody's synthesising them?

34
00:06:17,837 --> 00:06:20,549
It's been done,
but not in such concentrations.

35
00:06:20,632 --> 00:06:24,427
And hold on to your hat, Scully,
cos you're gonna love this.

36
00:06:24,511 --> 00:06:28,014
The pheromones we're talking about
contain human DNA.

37
00:06:28,098 --> 00:06:32,435
There's still a question as to whether
humans can produce pheromones...

38
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:34,396
...so how can that be?

39
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,483
I don't know, but if it's true
this guy's a walking aphrodisiac.

40
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:40,819
He's the ultimate sex magnet.

41
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:42,779
He or she?

42
00:06:42,862 --> 00:06:47,450
You've got victims of both sexes. Both a man
and a woman on the hotel security monitor.

43
00:06:47,534 --> 00:06:51,079
- I know. That is a puzzle.
- So what is our profile of the killer?

44
00:06:51,162 --> 00:06:55,875
Indeterminate height, weight and sex.
Unarmed, but extremely attractive.

45
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,627
It gets weirder.

46
00:06:57,711 --> 00:07:01,381
As I said, four deaths
have matched this MO in the last six weeks.

47
00:07:01,464 --> 00:07:06,219
In Boston, Hartford, Philadelphia,
and here in Washington.

48
00:07:06,303 --> 00:07:08,513
The killer's moving south.

49
00:07:08,597 --> 00:07:12,350
There was a death I made a note of a year ago
with the same symptoms.

50
00:07:12,434 --> 00:07:17,063
A 32-year-old UMW labour organiser was
found dead outside the town of Steveston...

51
00:07:17,147 --> 00:07:19,441
...in the woods of Massachusetts.

52
00:07:19,524 --> 00:07:23,987
Home to a sect of religious isolationists
called the Kindred.

53
00:07:24,696 --> 00:07:29,993
Right. They live up there without
electricity, phones. A lot like the Amish.

54
00:07:30,076 --> 00:07:35,123
The Kindred are known for their handmade
pottery. They mine the clay in the local hills.

55
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:37,292
What's so weird about that?

56
00:07:37,375 --> 00:07:41,171
The white clay in those hills
is particular to that region.

57
00:07:41,254 --> 00:07:45,842
It's also the same substance I scraped out of
the scratches on the latest victim's side.

58
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:50,847
Wait a minute. Aren't these people famous for
their abstinence and pure Christian ways?

59
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:56,353
Yes, but it looks as if one of them may have
forgotten to clean under his fingernails.

60
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:19,709
Hi.

61
00:08:19,793 --> 00:08:22,754
Ma'am.
This is Agent Scully. I'm Agent Mulder.

62
00:08:22,837 --> 00:08:27,884
- We're investigating a possible murder.
- Well, there aren't many killings around here.

63
00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:32,555
What can you tell me about the Kindred?

64
00:08:32,639 --> 00:08:35,058
They keep pretty much to themselves, huh?

65
00:08:36,851 --> 00:08:41,147
Yeah, some folks say it's cos they do
ceremonies up there. Voodoo or something.

66
00:08:41,231 --> 00:08:44,359
I've got nothing against them.
They bring in tourists.

67
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:48,363
- Did they let you take those pictures?
- Those are from the '30s.

68
00:08:48,446 --> 00:08:52,492
- And the missing ones?
- Having them reframed. They're under here.

69
00:08:52,575 --> 00:08:54,661
- Can I take a look at 'em?
- Sure.

70
00:09:20,687 --> 00:09:25,150
- How would I get up to see them?
- They don't like strangers up there much.

71
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:27,318
Road's in pretty rough shape.

72
00:09:27,402 --> 00:09:29,279
There's Steveston.

73
00:09:32,741 --> 00:09:35,744
That's them now.
They usually shop at the feed store.

74
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:47,005
Whoa, boy.

75
00:10:15,492 --> 00:10:17,577
Excuse me... Ladies?

76
00:10:19,788 --> 00:10:24,459
- I think I'm gonna go inside.
- Need anything from the feed store?

77
00:10:31,090 --> 00:10:32,967
Hi.

78
00:10:45,897 --> 00:10:48,399
She must have problems on the asphalt.

79
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,486
Has she ever thrown a shoe?

80
00:10:55,949 --> 00:10:58,034
What's her name?

81
00:11:00,912 --> 00:11:02,372
Alice.

82
00:11:03,957 --> 00:11:05,834
That's sweet.

83
00:11:05,917 --> 00:11:08,002
Did you name her?

84
00:11:11,256 --> 00:11:13,341
We named her all together.

85
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:16,636
I'm not allowed to talk outside.

86
00:11:16,719 --> 00:11:18,805
It's all right.

87
00:11:21,516 --> 00:11:23,601
I'm Dana Scully.

88
00:11:25,937 --> 00:11:28,189
I don't mean you any harm.

89
00:12:04,976 --> 00:12:06,477
Brother Andrew.

90
00:12:13,985 --> 00:12:15,403
What are you doing?

91
00:12:16,613 --> 00:12:18,489
I was just talking.

92
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:32,795
- You all right?
- Yeah, I think so.

93
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:34,964
You wanna sit down?

94
00:12:50,146 --> 00:12:52,231
Interesting way of life.

95
00:12:52,315 --> 00:12:55,151
Get any sense about 'em?

96
00:12:56,903 --> 00:13:01,491
- There's something up there, Mulder.
- Oh, I've been saying that for years.

97
00:13:26,516 --> 00:13:28,601
Oh, for a four-wheel drive.

98
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:38,736
Looks like about a mile... walk.

99
00:13:39,028 --> 00:13:41,114
After you.

100
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:48,746
Now, this...

101
00:13:49,747 --> 00:13:51,833
That's west.

102
00:13:52,542 --> 00:13:54,627
What does the map say?

103
00:13:54,711 --> 00:13:56,796
That we should be there already.

104
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:10,768
Mulder, look.

105
00:14:17,442 --> 00:14:20,445
We're FBI agents! Federal police!

106
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:25,283
I'm Agent Mulder. This is Agent Scully.
We're here to investigate a murder.

107
00:14:25,366 --> 00:14:28,745
I'm gonna have to ask you
to remain at a distance, please, sir.

108
00:14:28,828 --> 00:14:33,458
Your weapons are forbidden here.
We can outlast you at this spot.

109
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:40,965
You're not leaving where we stand
until your guns are handed to our council.

110
00:14:41,049 --> 00:14:43,468
You will have them again as you leave.

111
00:14:43,593 --> 00:14:45,845
- We can't do that.
<i>- </i> Please!

112
00:14:45,928 --> 00:14:49,515
I'm Sister Abbey. This is Brother Oakley.

113
00:14:49,599 --> 00:14:54,437
We're all saddened by what has happened
in your world, but it does not concern us.

114
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,899
Up here, no-one kills another... ever.

115
00:14:57,982 --> 00:15:00,526
We just want a few questions answered.

116
00:15:00,610 --> 00:15:03,029
Your weapons are unwelcome here, not you.

117
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:06,616
Come and pray with us, be one of us.

118
00:15:06,699 --> 00:15:08,576
You'll see we harm no-one.

119
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:10,745
Please relinquish your weapons.

120
00:15:16,334 --> 00:15:17,794
Please.

121
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:38,106
Now there is no reason to be afraid.

122
00:16:27,488 --> 00:16:29,574
Come. Sit.

123
00:16:49,677 --> 00:16:51,762
Let us pray as one.

124
00:16:54,932 --> 00:16:59,395
We who are separate give thanks
for our allotted time in this world.

125
00:17:00,438 --> 00:17:05,526
We ask for strength that we may bring forth
the bounty that God has provided.

126
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,486
Amen.

127
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:11,908
We pray for the day of the coming -
the moment of our release.

128
00:17:11,991 --> 00:17:13,201
Amen.

129
00:17:14,452 --> 00:17:16,120
Let us eat.

130
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:24,795
Could we ask a few questions? We're looking
for someone who may have come from here.

131
00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:27,465
- We have pictures.
- We do not allow pictures.

132
00:17:27,548 --> 00:17:29,300
A crime has been committed.

133
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:33,429
We have certain questions we need answered,
if you'll forgive us.

134
00:17:36,974 --> 00:17:38,851
What are these pictures?

135
00:17:38,935 --> 00:17:43,064
Hotel security videos of a man and a woman
who may have committed a murder.

136
00:17:43,147 --> 00:17:46,734
- Where was this crime committed?
- In a hotel in Washington DC.

137
00:17:46,817 --> 00:17:52,698
If we can arrange for you to look at the video
tape, maybe you can identify the individual.

138
00:17:54,325 --> 00:17:57,411
How much violence
has this person caused in your world?

139
00:17:57,495 --> 00:17:59,372
Five murders so far.

140
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:03,918
And may kill again,
which is why we need your help.

141
00:18:04,001 --> 00:18:05,670
Has anyone left recently?

142
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:11,926
Your world does not interest us! We have
no need for your violence or your questions!

143
00:18:15,680 --> 00:18:17,765
I've said what is needed.

144
00:18:18,683 --> 00:18:21,310
They have no right to be here at this time.

145
00:18:22,687 --> 00:18:24,772
Brother Wilton, stand.

146
00:18:31,237 --> 00:18:35,324
Before we can accept any man's person,
we must accept our own.

147
00:18:35,408 --> 00:18:39,370
And I ask who can stand in your sight
when once you are angry?

148
00:18:39,453 --> 00:18:41,747
I am ashamed to lift up my face.

149
00:18:41,831 --> 00:18:44,875
And I shall not be ashamed in this evil time.

150
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:48,921
Make atonements for this wrath,
Brother Wilton.

151
00:18:53,718 --> 00:18:58,389
- That's all right, we didn't take any of fence.
- Anger, as violence, is not tolerated.

152
00:18:58,472 --> 00:19:00,558
He must be admonished.

153
00:19:04,895 --> 00:19:07,773
- He can't breathe.
- He does not need your help.

154
00:19:09,317 --> 00:19:11,193
He's choking to death!

155
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:14,989
Remove Brother Aaron from the dining hall.

156
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:19,994
We did not invite you here to interfere.

157
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:22,079
We take care of our own.

158
00:19:50,191 --> 00:19:53,486
- Would you like to dance?
- Not right now.

159
00:19:55,029 --> 00:19:57,448
Look, I'm really not interested. OK?

160
00:19:59,033 --> 00:20:01,118
Just one dance.

161
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,165
Yeah.

162
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:09,001
One dance.

163
00:20:19,345 --> 00:20:21,430
It's a mile to your car.

164
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:25,059
Stay on the path.

165
00:20:33,234 --> 00:20:35,319
Thanks for your cooperation.

166
00:20:45,121 --> 00:20:47,623
The Addams Family finds religion.

167
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:49,959
Take me back to the 20th century.

168
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:53,087
- You believe all that back there?
- Believe all what?

169
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:56,090
All that "we take care of our own" business?

170
00:20:56,173 --> 00:20:59,677
They better take care of their own
or that man's a <i>dead</i> man.

171
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,139
- I think it was all an elaborate act.
- What, the choking?

172
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:06,142
No, this simple life,
living from abundance crap.

173
00:21:06,225 --> 00:21:10,646
These people know something, Scully.
You can see it in their eyes.

174
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:15,067
- You think they know the murderer?
- They didn't answer <i>one</i> question of ours.

175
00:21:15,151 --> 00:21:17,486
That outburst at the table was on cue.

176
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:20,364
Somehow they got us
to answer <i>their</i> questions.

177
00:21:20,448 --> 00:21:23,492
- Did you ask yourself why no children?
- That was odd.

178
00:21:23,576 --> 00:21:25,244
Wanna know what's really odd?

179
00:21:25,327 --> 00:21:30,374
You know those pictures we saw at the store
in Steveston today? The ones from the '30s?

180
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:33,752
I swear I saw some of those same faces
at the table tonight.

181
00:21:33,836 --> 00:21:36,839
They've probably been intermarrying
for years.

182
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:38,799
Maybe.

183
00:21:38,883 --> 00:21:42,219
Maybe not everything is as black and white
as it appears to be.

184
00:21:43,095 --> 00:21:47,266
- What are you doing?
- I'm gonna go back for a little look-see.

185
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:06,619
Maybe they went to the movies.

186
00:22:08,037 --> 00:22:10,664
- You hear that?
- Uh-huh.

187
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:17,041
What do you think?

188
00:24:17,583 --> 00:24:20,419
I think I wanna see what's in that cellar.

189
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:11,011
Come with me. I can give you information.

190
00:26:22,541 --> 00:26:25,377
- I know who did it.
- The murders?

191
00:26:25,461 --> 00:26:30,507
You've heard our prayers.
You've seen how we live our beliefs.

192
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:32,926
I want you to find this killer.

193
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:35,304
I want you to find him for me.

194
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:39,183
He was my best friend.

195
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:43,729
- What's his name?
- Brother Martin.

196
00:26:44,938 --> 00:26:47,024
I called him Marty.

197
00:27:22,976 --> 00:27:25,062
Marty was different.

198
00:27:25,145 --> 00:27:27,356
What do you mean, "different"?

199
00:27:29,942 --> 00:27:31,610
How does he kill?

200
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:33,987
We're not sure.

201
00:27:34,321 --> 00:27:36,990
All of the victims died of cardiac arrest.

202
00:27:37,074 --> 00:27:41,537
- He poisons them, doesn't he?
- Maybe. How do you know that?

203
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:57,511
I need to show you something.

204
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:00,138
Something about Marty.

205
00:28:54,109 --> 00:28:57,237
We found them out on Route 44.
We were wandering.

206
00:28:57,321 --> 00:29:00,741
Marty and I used to do that -
explore the edges of our world.

207
00:29:00,824 --> 00:29:03,285
Somebody must have left them for garbage.

208
00:29:03,368 --> 00:29:05,245
They <i>are</i> garbage.

209
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:08,832
- Why did you keep them?
- It was Martin who kept them.

210
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:12,419
Some of what I saw in the magazines,
some of it was beautiful...

211
00:29:12,502 --> 00:29:14,880
...but most of it I didn't like. It was garish.

212
00:29:14,963 --> 00:29:17,424
But Martin... Marty couldn't get enough.

213
00:29:17,507 --> 00:29:20,802
He liked even the paper
it was printed on. Slick.

214
00:29:22,888 --> 00:29:27,267
Marty was captured by your world.
He left us to become one of you.

215
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:49,474
Brother Wilton, the woman's returned.

216
00:30:49,558 --> 00:30:52,769
- Where is she?
- With Andrew in the main house.

217
00:30:52,853 --> 00:30:55,230
- What about the other one?
- He's missing.

218
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:25,594
You said Marty was different.

219
00:31:26,386 --> 00:31:28,055
Yes.

220
00:31:30,932 --> 00:31:35,562
- How? I mean, how did he kill his victims?
- I could be banished.

221
00:31:35,645 --> 00:31:38,732
Does it have something
to do with the ceremony tonight?

222
00:31:53,663 --> 00:31:55,916
What are you doing?

223
00:31:58,877 --> 00:32:00,545
Scully!

224
00:32:15,811 --> 00:32:17,896
Marty is different.

225
00:32:18,814 --> 00:32:20,482
We're all different.

226
00:32:25,403 --> 00:32:27,489
Oh...

227
00:32:28,281 --> 00:32:30,367
No...

228
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:37,582
Scully!

229
00:32:40,252 --> 00:32:42,337
Get off of her!

230
00:32:57,727 --> 00:32:59,855
I asked you not to interfere.

231
00:33:40,061 --> 00:33:43,190
- What the hell were you doing back there?
- I don't know.

232
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:45,358
- You don't know?!
- No.

233
00:33:49,237 --> 00:33:51,281
- You all right?

234
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:03,627
I wasn't ignoring you. No.

235
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:09,424
Of course I saw you,
I just... didn't recognise you. That's all.

236
00:34:11,176 --> 00:34:13,595
Excuse me. I'm on a conversation.

237
00:34:57,764 --> 00:35:00,392
- How you feeling?
- Better.

238
00:35:02,644 --> 00:35:04,938
A little embarrassed, actually.

239
00:35:05,021 --> 00:35:07,857
Why? You don't remember any of it.

240
00:35:10,068 --> 00:35:12,320
It's like I don't remember...

241
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:16,241
- Why didn't you get out before he...
- He said he knew who the killer was.

242
00:35:16,324 --> 00:35:19,452
How did you know <i>he</i> wasn't the killer?

243
00:35:19,995 --> 00:35:22,080
I believed him.

244
00:35:27,877 --> 00:35:31,256
So, what did you see down in the cellar?

245
00:35:31,339 --> 00:35:34,801
Just Brother Whatshisname
buried in a gopher hole in the wall.

246
00:35:34,884 --> 00:35:36,594
Buried alive!

247
00:35:37,804 --> 00:35:39,472
How do you know he was alive?

248
00:35:39,556 --> 00:35:42,934
Because I was in there with him
and his face was... different.

249
00:35:43,018 --> 00:35:47,731
Even his hair was almost feminine. It was
like he was going through a transformation.

250
00:35:47,814 --> 00:35:52,027
- Changing sexes?
- That would explain the hotel security video.

251
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:54,195
So you're saying these people...

252
00:35:54,279 --> 00:35:58,950
I know what I saw, Scully. And I saw you
about to do the "wild thing" with a stranger.

253
00:36:04,706 --> 00:36:06,791
Think he was trying to kill me?

254
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:10,420
Maybe it's the sex that kills.

255
00:36:10,503 --> 00:36:14,049
Well, if he was trying to kill me,
why did they let us go?

256
00:36:15,008 --> 00:36:17,093
I don't know.

257
00:36:26,394 --> 00:36:29,356
All right, let's break it up.

258
00:36:29,439 --> 00:36:30,940
Aw!

259
00:36:31,024 --> 00:36:33,109
Outta the car.

260
00:36:36,404 --> 00:36:38,073
Sorry, Officer.

261
00:36:39,616 --> 00:36:41,701
You, too.

262
00:36:41,868 --> 00:36:44,162
- You a pro?
- Pro?

263
00:36:44,245 --> 00:36:46,790
Wha...

264
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:51,461
Ugh!

265
00:37:10,688 --> 00:37:15,318
On a scale of one to ten
she was a "kind three"...

266
00:37:16,861 --> 00:37:19,280
...but there was something about her.

267
00:37:19,823 --> 00:37:23,618
Did she touch you or make physical contact
in any other manner?

268
00:37:25,787 --> 00:37:27,872
Her touch was...

269
00:37:28,331 --> 00:37:30,417
...electric...

270
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:34,045
...but after that I remember... only vaguely.

271
00:37:34,129 --> 00:37:37,924
- What do you remember?
- Nothing, actually.

272
00:37:38,007 --> 00:37:40,093
Try to remember, Michel.

273
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:42,554
The policeman supports what you said...

274
00:37:42,637 --> 00:37:46,057
...but maybe there was something... unusual
about this woman.

275
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:49,811
Something you'd feel uncomfortable
telling the police on the record.

276
00:37:49,894 --> 00:37:51,938
- But this is off the record?
- Yes.

277
00:37:52,021 --> 00:37:54,315
What did you see, Michel?

278
00:37:59,195 --> 00:38:03,199
After she left the car and fought with the cop,
I saw her in her clothes...

279
00:38:03,283 --> 00:38:07,245
...and she looked like... she looked like a man!

280
00:38:09,831 --> 00:38:11,499
She was a man?

281
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:14,043
The club scene used to be so simple.

282
00:38:17,672 --> 00:38:19,716
It's off the record?

283
00:38:20,675 --> 00:38:22,343
Scout's honour.

284
00:38:25,722 --> 00:38:29,392
One can't rule out the possibility
we're looking for a transvestite.

285
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:32,979
I think Don Juan knows the difference
between males and females.

286
00:38:33,062 --> 00:38:35,190
I don't want us to ignore the obvious.

287
00:38:35,273 --> 00:38:39,944
How else could you explain a woman
overpowering a 200lb cop? She was a he.

288
00:38:40,028 --> 00:38:44,824
Agent Mulder, Agent Scully, the credit card
stolen from the last victim was just used...

289
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:48,620
...to order takeout in a hotel downtown
eight blocks from here.

290
00:38:50,288 --> 00:38:52,582
It was always forbidden...

291
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:57,962
...but after the first time I couldn't help myself.

292
00:39:01,257 --> 00:39:03,551
Touching a human man...

293
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:06,554
...or a woman...

294
00:39:06,721 --> 00:39:09,849
...is as powerful for me as it was for you.

295
00:39:14,062 --> 00:39:18,942
This is Agent Scully requesting police backup
at 771 Catherine Street.

296
00:39:19,025 --> 00:39:20,693
It's the Hotel Catherine.

297
00:39:22,028 --> 00:39:28,034
Your world offers pleasures. Pleasures
we don't know because we're different.

298
00:39:28,117 --> 00:39:29,994
But you know that now.

299
00:39:31,287 --> 00:39:34,165
The others will punish me for what I've done.

300
00:39:34,249 --> 00:39:36,334
They'll find me...

301
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:40,880
...because the day is coming
and they won't leave without me.

302
00:39:46,344 --> 00:39:48,221
Mulder!

303
00:39:55,812 --> 00:39:57,689
Delivery.

304
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:06,823
FBI! FBI! Clear! Stay down!

305
00:40:08,032 --> 00:40:09,492
Dead body!

306
00:40:12,787 --> 00:40:13,955
Ugh!

307
00:40:14,622 --> 00:40:16,165
Scully?

308
00:40:16,249 --> 00:40:18,334
I'm OK.

309
00:40:28,636 --> 00:40:30,305
Agh!

310
00:40:51,284 --> 00:40:53,369
Scully, down the stairs.

311
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,706
Federal agent. I'm armed!

312
00:41:39,499 --> 00:41:41,584
Back away!

313
00:41:45,213 --> 00:41:46,422
Agh!

314
00:41:49,384 --> 00:41:50,551
Step away!

315
00:41:54,514 --> 00:41:55,890
Step away!

316
00:41:57,266 --> 00:42:00,395
Please... don't hurt him.

317
00:42:03,106 --> 00:42:05,400
No. Step away.

318
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,029
I'm armed.

319
00:42:26,087 --> 00:42:27,839
Scully!

320
00:42:28,881 --> 00:42:29,924
Ugh!

321
00:42:46,858 --> 00:42:50,445
The surrounding ten blocks
have been secured for the past hour.

322
00:42:50,528 --> 00:42:55,450
We set up roadblocks on all routes out to
Steveston. So far nothing, no reports of them.

323
00:42:55,533 --> 00:42:57,744
There's no way they could get through.

324
00:42:57,827 --> 00:43:02,081
What if they did get through?
There's only one place they'd hide.

325
00:43:24,645 --> 00:43:26,522
They're gone.

326
00:43:41,871 --> 00:43:44,624
We found something in the hayfield.

327
00:43:52,089 --> 00:43:56,761
I don't understand. How can they disappear?
They have no means of transportation.

328
00:43:56,844 --> 00:43:59,013
No <i>earthly</i> means of transportation.

329
00:44:34,799 --> 00:44:36,467
Natasha Cohn

330
00:44:46,561 --> 00:44:48,437
<i>I made this!</i>
