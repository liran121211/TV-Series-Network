1
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,095
Relax, they'll be here.

2
00:00:10,762 --> 00:00:13,348
The bank's gonna close in five minutes.

3
00:00:13,432 --> 00:00:15,767
- Sure it wasn't a bogus tip?
- No, it's real.

4
00:00:15,851 --> 00:00:18,770
I've been on this long enough.
I know the difference.

5
00:00:18,896 --> 00:00:22,691
Besides, I can feel it.
I can feel <i>them</i>. I'm inside their heads.

6
00:00:22,774 --> 00:00:25,611
Just as long as you keep yours!

7
00:00:27,696 --> 00:00:30,866
Message received, Agent Scully.
Loud and clear.

8
00:00:34,369 --> 00:00:37,873
Position Five, this is Agent Willis.
Do you copy?

9
00:00:54,097 --> 00:00:56,475
- What, are you nervous?
- Nope.

10
00:00:57,476 --> 00:00:59,811
I just don't want our luck to run out.

11
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:04,233
Baby, you <i>are</i> my luck.

12
00:01:04,316 --> 00:01:06,401
And no matter what happens...

13
00:01:06,485 --> 00:01:08,946
...whenever I look up at the stars...

14
00:01:09,905 --> 00:01:12,991
...I know you're gonna be
looking up at the same ones.

15
00:01:15,786 --> 00:01:17,829
The same ones, baby.

16
00:01:25,420 --> 00:01:28,173
You make every day like New Year's Eve!

17
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:37,182
Come on, people! Get down on the floor,
now! Get down on the floor!

18
00:01:38,767 --> 00:01:42,771
I ain't messin' around here! You! Down
on the floor, now! Now, or you're dead!

19
00:01:42,854 --> 00:01:47,609
Everyone! Down on the floor!
Or I'll execute every one of you! Move!

20
00:01:47,693 --> 00:01:51,613
Move! Put the money in the bag. Now!
Now! Move it!

21
00:01:51,697 --> 00:01:53,824
- Faster!
- Dupre!

22
00:01:54,366 --> 00:01:57,369
Drop the gun! FBI! Drop the gun!

23
00:01:57,452 --> 00:01:59,496
Now!

24
00:02:19,057 --> 00:02:21,143
Clear!

25
00:02:24,354 --> 00:02:27,149
Watch him carefully.
11 minutes, 55 seconds.

26
00:02:27,232 --> 00:02:29,151
Clear!

27
00:02:29,234 --> 00:02:31,236
Come on, Jack.

28
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,655
He's been flatlined for 12 minutes.

29
00:02:33,739 --> 00:02:37,326
Another amp of epi,
and we'll go again at 360.

30
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:38,910
Clear!

31
00:02:39,745 --> 00:02:41,913
Still no pulse.

32
00:02:43,582 --> 00:02:46,668
We've done all we can. I'm sorry.

33
00:02:46,752 --> 00:02:48,587
All right, let's call off.

34
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:53,091
- You want me to pronounce?
- No! You can't give up on him.

35
00:02:53,216 --> 00:02:56,428
- It's been over 13 minutes. He's dead.
- Go up to 400.

36
00:02:56,511 --> 00:02:58,430
We lost him. Let him go.

37
00:02:58,513 --> 00:03:01,183
I'm a doctor! Go up to 400,
or I'll do it myself!

38
00:03:04,436 --> 00:03:06,521
Clear!

39
00:03:07,856 --> 00:03:09,191
Still no pulse.

40
00:03:09,274 --> 00:03:13,362
Give him another amp of epi intracardial
and go up to 400 again.

41
00:03:13,445 --> 00:03:15,530
Do it!

42
00:03:19,284 --> 00:03:21,787
Clear!

43
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:23,038
Again!

44
00:03:23,955 --> 00:03:26,750
- Come on, Jack.
- Clear!

45
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:29,920
Come on!

46
00:03:32,631 --> 00:03:35,967
We got a rhythm.
Don't ask me how, but he's back!

47
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:39,763
BP's 80 over 50 and climbing. 90 over 50.

48
00:05:35,337 --> 00:05:38,006
Hello, Mr Goldbaum.
How are we doing tonight?

49
00:05:38,089 --> 00:05:42,344
I'm just going to adjust your drip.
I'll check on you again later.

50
00:07:20,191 --> 00:07:22,277
Any word from Willis?

51
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:25,447
Still missing. He hasn't
been home or to the office.

52
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,782
I heard something about a mutilation...

53
00:07:27,866 --> 00:07:32,704
Yeah. Three fingers on Dupre's left hand
were severed by surgical shears.

54
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:35,206
We lifted prints. They're Willie's.

55
00:07:35,332 --> 00:07:38,376
He said he was chasing this guy
for almost a year?

56
00:07:38,501 --> 00:07:41,212
He lived the case.
It was all he ever thought about.

57
00:07:41,338 --> 00:07:43,882
What are you thinking?

58
00:07:43,965 --> 00:07:47,636
That maybe this is some kind
of post-trauma psychosis.

59
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:51,306
Like the way soldiers sometimes
mutilate the body of a dead enemy.

60
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:54,392
That still doesn't explain
why he would just vanish.

61
00:07:54,517 --> 00:07:57,228
Dupre's partner... Who was she?

62
00:08:00,148 --> 00:08:02,233
Lula Phillips.

63
00:08:02,317 --> 00:08:07,155
They met while she was serving a 10-year
sentence for manslaughter in Maryland.

64
00:08:07,238 --> 00:08:11,409
- He was a prison guard.
- Until the warden found out their secret.

65
00:08:11,534 --> 00:08:15,246
According to Lula's cell mate,
they carried on quite a torrid romance.

66
00:08:15,372 --> 00:08:18,249
It says here she was released
on May 2nd, 1993.

67
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:22,587
One week before the first robbery
at Annapolis Savings and Loan.

68
00:08:22,671 --> 00:08:25,507
A 65-year-old female teller
was pistol-whipped.

69
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:28,093
Died from a massive subdural haemorrhage.

70
00:08:28,218 --> 00:08:30,845
She didn't put the money
in the bag fast enough!

71
00:08:30,929 --> 00:08:34,349
- Lovely couple!
- Well, apparently they took turns.

72
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:38,019
One pulling a job,
while the other one drove getaway.

73
00:08:38,103 --> 00:08:40,355
Between the two of them
they've killed seven people

74
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:43,191
and got away with close to $100,000.

75
00:08:43,274 --> 00:08:46,611
That's a lot of money, now that
she doesn't have to split it.

76
00:08:46,736 --> 00:08:48,029
Well, we're putting her face out there.

77
00:08:48,113 --> 00:08:51,700
Local newspapers,
America's Most Wanted...

78
00:08:51,783 --> 00:08:53,868
Am I boring you?

79
00:08:53,952 --> 00:08:58,289
- They were married.
- Yeah, last May in Atlantic City. So what?

80
00:08:58,415 --> 00:09:01,626
So I don't think this was a
simple necrophiliac mutilation.

81
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:06,047
Willis sliced and diced those fingers
to get at the wedding ring.

82
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:30,655
Anybody here?

83
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:34,159
Lula?

84
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:51,009
Baby, baby, baby...

85
00:10:05,148 --> 00:10:07,192
Damn!

86
00:10:29,464 --> 00:10:31,049
It's a left thumb print.

87
00:10:31,132 --> 00:10:33,134
Look at these two bifurcations here.

88
00:10:33,218 --> 00:10:36,304
Whoever was holding that cleaver
used his left hand.

89
00:10:36,387 --> 00:10:39,474
- "Whoever"? It was Willis.
- Willis is right-handed.

90
00:10:39,557 --> 00:10:41,810
I checked his pistol grip at the armoury.

91
00:10:41,893 --> 00:10:45,063
But the bank surveillance tapes
show Dupre is left-handed.

92
00:10:45,188 --> 00:10:47,398
I'm not sure where you're going with this.

93
00:10:47,482 --> 00:10:50,151
How long did Willis flatline
before you revived him?

94
00:10:50,235 --> 00:10:51,903
Just over 13 minutes.

95
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:55,240
This EKG strip recorded
his cardiac activity at the time.

96
00:10:55,365 --> 00:10:58,576
In your medical opinion,
what does that look like?

97
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:01,079
It could be anything.

98
00:11:01,162 --> 00:11:03,915
Instrument malfunction,
electrical overload...

99
00:11:03,998 --> 00:11:06,167
But what does it look like?

100
00:11:07,210 --> 00:11:09,087
Two heartbeats.

101
00:11:10,213 --> 00:11:14,259
Dupre and Willis went into cardiac arrest
at the exact same time, right?

102
00:11:14,342 --> 00:11:15,760
Right...

103
00:11:15,844 --> 00:11:18,930
For a period of minutes,
both men were technically dead.

104
00:11:19,055 --> 00:11:23,101
- Technically. But we resuscitated Willis.
- You resuscitated his body.

105
00:11:23,184 --> 00:11:24,602
Mulder...

106
00:11:24,686 --> 00:11:27,021
Two men died in that crash room, Scully.

107
00:11:27,105 --> 00:11:29,858
One man came back. The question is...

108
00:11:31,401 --> 00:11:33,278
...which one?

109
00:11:41,202 --> 00:11:45,456
What can you tell me about
near-death experiences, Agent Scully?

110
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:50,962
The usual stuff. The tunnel, the light, people
rising up and viewing their own bodies.

111
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:53,798
As a scientist,
how do you account for the phenomenon?

112
00:11:53,882 --> 00:11:56,634
Some sort of dissociative
hallucinatory activity.

113
00:11:56,759 --> 00:11:57,802
Hm.

114
00:11:57,886 --> 00:12:02,640
Half of all the adults who have had a
near-death experience cannot wear a watch.

115
00:12:02,724 --> 00:12:08,563
The increased electrical activity in their
bodies renders the watches inoperable.

116
00:12:08,646 --> 00:12:11,983
I know this sounds kooky,
but, as any biologist will tell you...

117
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:15,153
...when cells die and genetic material
begins to unfold...

118
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:17,655
...a tremendous charge of energy is released.

119
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,491
Doctor Varnes believes this is responsible...

120
00:12:20,575 --> 00:12:23,828
...for the transformational nature
of the experience.

121
00:12:23,912 --> 00:12:27,081
People do return from the
event profoundly changed.

122
00:12:27,165 --> 00:12:29,167
Changed how?

123
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:33,671
Personality shifts, perceived
psychic abilities, increased zest for life.

124
00:12:33,755 --> 00:12:36,591
What about the negative consequences?

125
00:12:36,674 --> 00:12:39,344
They're rare. But in the process of dying...

126
00:12:39,427 --> 00:12:42,347
...there is a time
during which the body is vulnerable.

127
00:12:42,472 --> 00:12:44,515
- I don't understand.
- Well...

128
00:12:44,641 --> 00:12:48,853
...there was a pilot in my support group
who died in a commuter plane crash...

129
00:12:48,937 --> 00:12:51,105
...along with his three passengers.

130
00:12:51,189 --> 00:12:54,692
This was a few years ago.
Now, he recalls floating up...

131
00:12:54,817 --> 00:13:00,031
...in a brilliant aura of light, and then feeling
an overwhelming need to return to his body.

132
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:04,702
He was revived in the ambulance on the way
to the hospital. The only survivor.

133
00:13:04,786 --> 00:13:07,205
Soon after that, the visions started.

134
00:13:07,288 --> 00:13:10,875
Visions of making love to his wife,
in ways that weren't in his memory.

135
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,796
Turns out that one of
the dead passengers on the plane

136
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:16,279
was having an affair with his wife.

137
00:13:16,339 --> 00:13:18,716
The dead passenger's memory, his...

138
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:22,053
...his consciousness,
had survived through the pilot.

139
00:13:22,178 --> 00:13:25,974
- What happened?
- The pilot became increasingly disoriented.

140
00:13:26,057 --> 00:13:28,142
Schizophrenic, his doctor claims.

141
00:13:28,226 --> 00:13:31,312
He strangled his wife
with an extension cord.

142
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:38,319
That's a nice story!

143
00:13:39,821 --> 00:13:44,242
I don't discount the near-death experience.
It can be explained empirically...

144
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:48,079
- ..by stimulation of the temporal lobe.
- I sense a big "but" coming!

145
00:13:48,204 --> 00:13:52,834
I still believe that Jack's disappearance
can be explained in psychological terms.

146
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:54,419
For instance?

147
00:13:54,502 --> 00:13:58,339
The stress of the case, the trauma
of being shot, Jack's personality...

148
00:13:58,423 --> 00:14:02,510
- How well do you know him?
- We dated. For almost a year.

149
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:04,929
He was my instructor at the Academy.

150
00:14:06,097 --> 00:14:08,933
The plot thickens!

151
00:14:10,268 --> 00:14:13,104
We even had the same birthday.

152
00:14:13,229 --> 00:14:17,859
We used to celebrate in some dive
in Stafford that had a slanted pool table.

153
00:14:17,942 --> 00:14:20,445
But it was always so hard for Jack to...

154
00:14:20,528 --> 00:14:23,197
...relax. It was impossible for him, really.

155
00:14:23,281 --> 00:14:26,951
He was always so... intense,
so relentlessly determined.

156
00:14:27,035 --> 00:14:31,789
Do you believe he's predisposed
to this type of psychotic episode?

157
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:35,209
It's a long way from saying Jack
had a near-death experience...

158
00:14:35,293 --> 00:14:39,130
...to saying his body's been
inhabited by Warren Dupre.

159
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:42,633
A long way!

160
00:14:46,054 --> 00:14:47,472
What the hell...?!

161
00:14:50,475 --> 00:14:53,978
- You're such a creature of habit, Tommy.
- Who the hell are you?

162
00:14:54,062 --> 00:14:57,148
- Get outta bed.
- I ain't got no clothes on.

163
00:14:57,273 --> 00:15:00,443
Get outta bed!
I don't wanna shoot you lying down.

164
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:05,239
Who are you - the rent man? Cos I'm
all paid up. I swear. I'm not kiddin'.

165
00:15:05,323 --> 00:15:08,493
- Come on, you can go ask Cosmo.
- Shut up!

166
00:15:11,162 --> 00:15:13,164
- Where is she?
- Where's who?

167
00:15:13,247 --> 00:15:16,667
- Your sister.
- Huh! Lula?

168
00:15:17,502 --> 00:15:21,923
Look, I don't know. I don't know, I swear!
I was just waiting to see her on the news.

169
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:24,842
What'd I tell you?

170
00:15:24,926 --> 00:15:26,677
Check it out.

171
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:38,272
The sound's busted.

172
00:15:38,356 --> 00:15:42,360
Looks like they're gonna find her
before you do, pal!

173
00:15:42,443 --> 00:15:45,947
Is that what you think?
It's not what I think.

174
00:15:53,704 --> 00:15:56,124
I miss her, Tommy.

175
00:15:56,207 --> 00:15:58,709
I miss her so bad!

176
00:15:58,793 --> 00:16:00,878
That's why I came back.

177
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:05,800
- Do I know you from somewhere?
- Everything I see...

178
00:16:06,717 --> 00:16:08,386
...I see her.

179
00:16:08,469 --> 00:16:10,847
Jesus, man! You're bleeding.

180
00:16:16,394 --> 00:16:19,480
Even ugliness is beautiful... because of her.

181
00:16:23,651 --> 00:16:26,904
- OK, what are you doing?
- You set us up, Tommy.

182
00:16:28,239 --> 00:16:30,908
You sold us out to the FBI!

183
00:16:32,869 --> 00:16:34,412
Dupre?

184
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:47,758
Neighbours heard a gunshot,
but nobody checked it out.

185
00:16:47,884 --> 00:16:51,929
Patrol guys responded this morning
to an anonymous 911 and found him here.

186
00:16:52,013 --> 00:16:56,517
Except the rats found him first.
The victim's name was Thomas Phillips.

187
00:16:56,601 --> 00:16:58,686
That's Lula's brother.

188
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:03,524
There's not a lot of family resemblance left,
between the rats and the.45 in the face!

189
00:17:03,608 --> 00:17:07,361
<i>- </i> Oh, I hate this nicotine stuff.
<i>- </i> What's the story?

190
00:17:07,445 --> 00:17:11,282
Oh, he's single. He's lived here
alone for the past seven months.

191
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:15,453
A few priors - small stuff, mostly.
B and E, narcotics possession.

192
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:17,705
Nothing like his big sister.

193
00:17:17,788 --> 00:17:22,460
- Was the TV on when they found him?
- No. Why?

194
00:17:23,753 --> 00:17:27,798
I don't think Tommy was much of a reader,
since he doesn't have any books.

195
00:17:27,882 --> 00:17:29,717
From the position of the body,

196
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,553
I'd say maybe he was watching
the tube when he was shot.

197
00:17:32,637 --> 00:17:36,724
- Print kit's over there. Knock yourself out!
<i>- </i> Get out of my way, Ace!

198
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:40,728
Regulations state, to gain access
to a crime scene, you gotta show ID!

199
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:42,980
Looks like you were right.

200
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:45,149
Excuse me.

201
00:17:45,274 --> 00:17:46,776
Jack...

202
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:54,075
Is there a problem here?

203
00:17:54,158 --> 00:17:57,245
No, I just, uh... I don't have any ID.

204
00:17:57,328 --> 00:18:00,164
Would you tell this gentleman who I am?

205
00:18:00,248 --> 00:18:02,583
Officer, this is Agent Jack Willis.

206
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:05,670
Violent Crimes Section
of the Washington Bureau.

207
00:18:05,795 --> 00:18:07,838
Come on, let's talk out here.

208
00:18:07,964 --> 00:18:10,341
I was just doing my job, miss!

209
00:18:10,466 --> 00:18:15,012
Willis, what happened?! Half the Bureau's
been looking for you. Where have you been?

210
00:18:15,137 --> 00:18:20,017
I don't know. I just... wasn't myself.
I just kinda... woke up out on the street!

211
00:18:20,101 --> 00:18:23,688
- I'm taking you back to the hospital.
- No way! I'm staying right here!

212
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:26,107
- You're not <i>ready</i> to be here.
- Who says?!

213
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:28,276
Jack, you're recovering
from a major trauma.

214
00:18:28,359 --> 00:18:30,695
It's a miracle you're even able to walk!

215
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:33,948
- This is Tommy Phillips' place, right?
- Jack...

216
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:35,992
Was he killed with a.45?

217
00:18:37,368 --> 00:18:39,453
As a matter of fact, he was.

218
00:18:39,537 --> 00:18:42,039
He was! That's Lula's weapon of choice.

219
00:18:42,164 --> 00:18:47,169
I know these people. I've been after them
for a long time. We're halfway there!

220
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:52,883
- You <i>did</i> open the book on this one.
- And I'll be there when it's closed!

221
00:18:53,009 --> 00:18:54,635
All right.

222
00:18:54,719 --> 00:18:57,638
But, as a colleague and as a friend...

223
00:18:57,722 --> 00:19:01,976
...I recommend you have a full medical
evaluation. Physical <i>and</i> psychological.

224
00:19:02,059 --> 00:19:04,729
All right, fair enough.

225
00:19:12,236 --> 00:19:15,239
Jack! Good to see you back
among the living.

226
00:19:15,364 --> 00:19:17,908
- It's good to <i>be</i> back.
- Jack.

227
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:22,330
- So what have we got here?
- Mulder here found a print on the TV.

228
00:19:22,413 --> 00:19:25,499
A partial oblique. And it's <i>not</i> the victim's.

229
00:19:27,418 --> 00:19:31,005
Good work, Agent Mulder. I'm impressed!

230
00:19:44,393 --> 00:19:46,437
That's fancy shooting.

231
00:19:46,562 --> 00:19:49,857
I gotta get re-certified before
they give me my weapon back.

232
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:54,737
Well, by the looks of it, I wouldn't
worry about re-certification.

233
00:19:58,032 --> 00:20:02,453
- Is there anything else you wanted?
- Yeah, it's Scully's birthday.

234
00:20:03,454 --> 00:20:05,790
I was wondering if you'd sign that for me.

235
00:20:05,915 --> 00:20:08,292
Sure! Be glad to.

236
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:11,045
Always glad to celebrate the good times.

237
00:20:16,092 --> 00:20:18,636
There you go!

238
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:21,305
Happy birthday, Scully.

239
00:20:23,641 --> 00:20:25,226
You're two months early.

240
00:20:25,309 --> 00:20:28,562
It's from Willis. I thought you two
had the same birthday?

241
00:20:29,647 --> 00:20:31,649
- We do.
- Well, that's news to him.

242
00:20:31,774 --> 00:20:35,486
I asked him to sign it.
And he signed it with his left hand.

243
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:36,987
You tested him.

244
00:20:37,071 --> 00:20:40,574
Yeah. I found out evidence from
the Phillips murder is missing.

245
00:20:40,658 --> 00:20:44,829
- What evidence?
- The print we lifted. Our best lead is gone.

246
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:48,416
Someone stole it before the lab
had a chance to take a look at it.

247
00:20:50,251 --> 00:20:55,464
- And you think Willis is responsible?
- I'm not sure Willis <i>is</i> Willis.

248
00:20:56,465 --> 00:20:58,759
Can you at least accept the possibility...

249
00:20:58,843 --> 00:21:02,596
...that, during his near-death experience,
psychic transference occurred?

250
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:05,933
Can't <i>you</i> accept the possibility
that this isn't an X-File?!

251
00:21:06,016 --> 00:21:09,186
Aside from the expected level
of post-trauma stress...

252
00:21:09,311 --> 00:21:13,774
...Jack passed both of his evaluations -
physical <i>and</i> psychological.

253
00:21:13,858 --> 00:21:18,612
Just because someone forgets a birthday,
it doesn't mean that he's been possessed!

254
00:21:18,696 --> 00:21:22,700
When I was studying for my medical boards,
I forgot my birthday, too!

255
00:21:22,825 --> 00:21:24,952
Did you forget how to sign your name?

256
00:21:25,035 --> 00:21:30,791
This is a copy of the automobile requisition
form Willis filed the day before he was shot.

257
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,002
Compare the signatures.

258
00:21:36,672 --> 00:21:39,216
Like I said, Mulder - stress. All right?

259
00:21:39,341 --> 00:21:42,511
It can significantly affect
someone's cursive standard.

260
00:21:43,554 --> 00:21:46,557
I'm afraid this doesn't prove a thing.

261
00:22:19,924 --> 00:22:22,009
Agent Willis here.

262
00:22:25,221 --> 00:22:27,264
Jack?

263
00:22:27,389 --> 00:22:29,683
- Where are you going?
- We got a break!

264
00:22:29,767 --> 00:22:32,603
- A landlord thinks he's got our girl.
- Hotline?

265
00:22:32,728 --> 00:22:36,524
Yeah. Saw her picture in the post office.
There's the address.

266
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:38,943
- Jack, can I ask you something?
- Yeah, sure.

267
00:22:39,026 --> 00:22:43,447
The Phillips murder. The print
Mulder lifted off the TV. It's missing.

268
00:22:43,572 --> 00:22:45,616
And?

269
00:22:45,741 --> 00:22:48,285
And you were carrying the evidence back.

270
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,247
Are you implying something, Agent Scully?

271
00:22:55,584 --> 00:23:00,130
I don't know anything about any missing
print. Now, I'm ten minutes away...

272
00:23:00,256 --> 00:23:04,218
...from closing the biggest case
of my career. Are you coming?

273
00:23:07,805 --> 00:23:09,126
What's the apartment number
again?

274
00:23:09,181 --> 00:23:10,474
202.

275
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:12,643
Oh, yeah.

276
00:23:22,486 --> 00:23:24,822
- What was this guy's name?
- Multrevich.

277
00:23:24,947 --> 00:23:27,074
- Multrevich?

278
00:23:27,157 --> 00:23:29,243
All right, all right, all right!

279
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:32,496
Mr Multrevich, I'm from the FBI. Jack Willis.

280
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:35,165
- We spoke on the phone, right?
- Oh, yeah.

281
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:37,751
Have you ever seen this lady?

282
00:23:39,295 --> 00:23:42,339
Yeah. 207. Two days ago.

283
00:23:42,423 --> 00:23:44,842
First and last month - cash.

284
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:47,595
- Where's 207?
- Down the hallway.

285
00:23:47,678 --> 00:23:50,598
We want you to go back
inside your apartment...

286
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:53,350
...and stay away from the windows. Thanks.

287
00:23:54,685 --> 00:23:58,439
Where's our backup?
You said you called them, right?

288
00:23:58,522 --> 00:24:02,610
Should've been here ten minutes ago.
She may be running down a fire escape!

289
00:24:02,693 --> 00:24:05,112
I'm gonna call in again.

290
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:07,615
Look! That's her!

291
00:24:25,841 --> 00:24:29,178
- Where is she? Where'd she go?!
- I'll check back here.

292
00:25:30,739 --> 00:25:32,282
<i>Yeeargghhh!</i>

293
00:25:36,453 --> 00:25:39,123
Face down! Face down!

294
00:25:39,206 --> 00:25:41,875
Hands behind your back!

295
00:25:41,959 --> 00:25:44,044
- Now!

296
00:25:52,052 --> 00:25:54,388
She's all yours, Jack.

297
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:57,307
Yeah... Like a dog on a leash.

298
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:12,072
I already cuffed her.

299
00:26:12,156 --> 00:26:15,242
They're for you, Scully. Put 'em on.

300
00:26:15,325 --> 00:26:18,912
- What's going on, Jack?
- Put 'em on. Or I'll blow you in half.

301
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:20,164
Jack...

302
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:22,958
Shut up! Put 'em on!

303
00:26:47,024 --> 00:26:49,943
Come on, baby.

304
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:52,112
Come on, get up, baby.

305
00:26:53,614 --> 00:26:55,783
Look at you...

306
00:26:55,866 --> 00:26:57,993
Your face is all dirty.

307
00:26:59,161 --> 00:27:01,789
- Keep your stinking hands off me!
- Baby!

308
00:27:02,831 --> 00:27:05,626
You ain't gonna believe where I've been.

309
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:18,722
Sure it's crazy. You don't think
I <i>know</i> it's crazy? This isn't my face!

310
00:27:18,847 --> 00:27:20,891
These aren't my hands!

311
00:27:21,016 --> 00:27:23,894
But it's me in here! And I know you.

312
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:26,563
I know everything about you, baby.

313
00:27:26,647 --> 00:27:28,899
Come on, ask me something.

314
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:32,402
Your birthday is April 7th.
Your favourite colour is red.

315
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:34,071
Come on...

316
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:37,199
Come on, ask me something else.
Come on, ask me!

317
00:27:37,908 --> 00:27:41,745
OK... OK, what did we do
after we got married?

318
00:27:43,997 --> 00:27:46,083
Right after?

319
00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:51,421
- After that.
- Well... we went down to the beach.

320
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:57,719
I took out my buck knife
and I sliced open my palm.

321
00:27:59,721 --> 00:28:01,765
And then I slit open <i>your</i> palm.

322
00:28:05,936 --> 00:28:08,772
And we let the blood drip
down in the water.

323
00:28:15,946 --> 00:28:18,782
- Then what did you say to me?
- I said...

324
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:23,871
..."This is so we can be married
in all the oceans of the world."

325
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:33,547
And then I made you a solemn oath.

326
00:28:37,301 --> 00:28:40,220
To <i>never</i> take this ring off my finger.

327
00:28:41,805 --> 00:28:43,307
Ever!

328
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:47,978
And I mean to keep that promise.

329
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:54,651
This is... This is just too weird!

330
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:58,572
I can't believe it's really you!

331
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:04,995
Don't worry, baby.

332
00:29:07,122 --> 00:29:10,167
It won't make any difference in the dark.

333
00:29:14,087 --> 00:29:17,007
<i>- </i> We'll be in touch.
- When do I get my reward?

334
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,176
We'll call you.

335
00:29:19,259 --> 00:29:21,803
Now <i>I'm</i> worried. 12 hours with no word?

336
00:29:23,639 --> 00:29:28,518
I don't get it. Why's her car still sitting out
front? Why didn't Willis call for backup?

337
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:31,355
Because it wasn't Willis
who answered the hotline.

338
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:35,359
- You heard the recording. It was his voice.
- Forget it, Bruskin.

339
00:29:35,484 --> 00:29:38,987
Plus which... the manager
just ID'd him and Scully.

340
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:42,366
I said, forget it, Bruskin!

341
00:29:47,037 --> 00:29:50,123
This isn't one of your X-File theories, is it?

342
00:29:52,876 --> 00:29:57,214
It doesn't matter what I think.
We're still after the same thing.

343
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:07,474
- Mulder.
<i>- FBI centrex operator. Please hold.</i>

344
00:30:07,557 --> 00:30:10,310
- Yeah.
<i>- Guess who, Ace.</i>

345
00:30:10,394 --> 00:30:12,980
Willis?!

346
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:15,482
That depends on who you ask, don't it?

347
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,567
Where's Scully?

348
00:30:17,693 --> 00:30:20,070
You're the FBI!

349
00:30:20,195 --> 00:30:22,406
<i>You</i> figure it out!

350
00:30:22,489 --> 00:30:24,408
Let me talk to her.

351
00:30:25,909 --> 00:30:28,036
Yeah, sure.

352
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:32,916
- Mulder...
- Dana, are you OK?

353
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,668
- Don't...
<i>- Dana?</i>

354
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:36,336
OK!

355
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,922
That's it! Goodbye!

356
00:30:42,843 --> 00:30:45,095
It's not gonna work, Jack.

357
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,097
You don't think so?

358
00:30:47,222 --> 00:30:50,934
Bureau policy prohibits
negotiating with kidnappers.

359
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:53,770
But you already know that, don't you, Jack?

360
00:30:53,854 --> 00:30:55,939
Stop calling me that!

361
00:30:56,023 --> 00:31:00,694
Your name is Jack Willis.
You were born February 23, 1957.

362
00:31:00,777 --> 00:31:04,614
- You live at 51 Stanhope...
- My name is Warren James Dupre!

363
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:09,745
And I was born in Clammouth Falls,
Oregon, in the Year of the Rat!

364
00:31:11,121 --> 00:31:14,041
We spent a weekend up at Pine Barrens.

365
00:31:14,958 --> 00:31:18,545
You taught me how to fish through the ice.

366
00:31:19,963 --> 00:31:23,258
It was your parents' cabin.
Jack, try to remember.

367
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:27,137
We drove up in a snowstorm.

368
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:29,306
Come on, Jack!

369
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:37,147
Don't think I didn't see what you did!

370
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:41,651
I was like a little slip of paper,
up there on that hospital ceiling.

371
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:44,905
- I saw everything.
- What did you see?

372
00:31:44,988 --> 00:31:48,992
You left me to <i>die</i> on that table,
while you tried to save your friend!

373
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:52,245
- You <i>are</i> my friend!
- Too bad he was gone already.

374
00:31:52,996 --> 00:31:57,667
I watched him go. Just saw him slip away
down that long, black tunnel.

375
00:31:57,751 --> 00:32:00,087
No. We brought you back.

376
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:02,422
<i>You</i> shot me dead!

377
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,843
And then <i>you</i> let me die.

378
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:10,597
No. You won't kill me, Jack.

379
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,433
You call me that one more time...

380
00:32:13,517 --> 00:32:15,602
...and I'll make you stone cold.

381
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:18,855
Easy, baby. Easy! Not yet.

382
00:32:19,856 --> 00:32:21,983
Remember, she's our ticket.

383
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:31,451
Hey!

384
00:32:34,371 --> 00:32:38,125
- Got any more of this soda?
- You just drank the last of it.

385
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:40,043
Soda...?

386
00:32:40,127 --> 00:32:42,212
How much of that have you had?

387
00:32:42,295 --> 00:32:46,049
- What's it to you?
- Jack Willis is diabetic.

388
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:50,720
Which means that you are. Too much sugar
in the system could lead to hyperglycaemia.

389
00:32:50,804 --> 00:32:53,890
Maybe that's why
your stomach's hurting so bad.

390
00:32:54,015 --> 00:32:58,562
Abdominal pain is the first sign
of impending diabetic coma.

391
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:00,730
You need insulin.

392
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:18,248
<i>I feel myself getting into their heads,</i>
<i>and I'm scared by what I'm feeling.</i>

393
00:33:18,373 --> 00:33:24,004
<i>The intoxicating freedom that comes from</i>
<i>disconnecting action and consequence.</i>

394
00:33:24,087 --> 00:33:28,758
<i>Theirs is a world where nothing</i>
<i>matters but their own needs...</i>

395
00:33:29,593 --> 00:33:31,928
<i>..their own impossible appetites.</i>

396
00:33:32,762 --> 00:33:37,517
<i>And while the pleasure they derive</i>
<i>from acts of violence is clearly sexual...</i>

397
00:33:37,601 --> 00:33:40,020
<i>..it also speaks to what</i>
<i>Warden Jackson called</i>

398
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:43,356
<i>their "operatic devotion to each other".</i>

399
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:45,859
<i>It's a love affair... I almost envy.</i>

400
00:33:53,617 --> 00:33:57,287
Cadenceville PD just reported
a drugstore was broken into here...

401
00:33:57,370 --> 00:33:59,789
...on the corner of
Old Forge Road and Madison.

402
00:33:59,915 --> 00:34:03,960
I'm betting that Scully is somewhere
within this five-mile radius.

403
00:34:04,085 --> 00:34:08,882
- Am I missing something?!
- 200 units of NPH insulin were taken.

404
00:34:08,965 --> 00:34:11,051
Willis is diabetic.

405
00:34:11,134 --> 00:34:16,598
Get me a census report. Let's see
how many households we're talking about.

406
00:34:19,809 --> 00:34:23,230
Quick, quick, quick!
My legs are starting to go numb!

407
00:34:23,313 --> 00:34:24,481
Hold on...

408
00:34:27,317 --> 00:34:29,903
- What the hell...?
- Drop the needle.

409
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:34,241
- Without this medicine, he dies.
- Yeah! So you said.

410
00:34:35,492 --> 00:34:37,577
Now... put it down.

411
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:40,413
Unless you want me
to put you down with it.

412
00:34:42,791 --> 00:34:45,335
What the hell are you doing?

413
00:34:46,586 --> 00:34:49,339
I need that medicine!

414
00:34:50,674 --> 00:34:54,344
- You still haven't figured it out, have you?
- Figured <i>what</i> out?

415
00:34:54,469 --> 00:34:56,596
It wasn't my brother who set you up!

416
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,185
You?!

417
00:35:02,269 --> 00:35:04,354
Yeah... Me.

418
00:35:07,983 --> 00:35:09,859
How do you think I got away so clean?

419
00:35:09,943 --> 00:35:13,196
The minute you stepped into that bank,
I was out of there.

420
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,365
I got the money and I got rid of you!

421
00:35:15,490 --> 00:35:17,534
At least, I thought I did.

422
00:35:22,205 --> 00:35:23,540
Agh...

423
00:35:30,338 --> 00:35:32,382
Tactical room. This is it!

424
00:35:35,051 --> 00:35:36,720
Mulder.

425
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:39,556
<i>- Listen carefully.</i>
- Where's Willis?

426
00:35:39,639 --> 00:35:42,726
<i>- Oh, he's here somewhere.</i>
- Let me talk to Scully.

427
00:35:42,851 --> 00:35:44,728
Not this time.

428
00:35:44,853 --> 00:35:47,731
We don't deal unless we know Scully's alive.

429
00:35:47,814 --> 00:35:49,899
She's alive.

430
00:35:49,983 --> 00:35:52,068
She's not happy, but... she's alive.

431
00:35:53,403 --> 00:35:57,324
You listen to me. You lay one hand
on Scully, and so help me God...

432
00:35:57,407 --> 00:36:01,995
If I were you, I'd stop talking
and start passing around the collection hat.

433
00:36:02,078 --> 00:36:06,583
Cos if you ever wanna see Scully again,
it's gonna cost you a million dollars.

434
00:36:06,666 --> 00:36:10,420
<i>Have it by this time tomorrow.</i>
<i>I'll tell you when and where.</i>

435
00:36:11,755 --> 00:36:14,591
We got it. It's a 202 number.

436
00:36:14,674 --> 00:36:18,011
<i>- </i> Great!
<i>- </i> It's coming through.

437
00:36:18,928 --> 00:36:21,056
- Here it is.
- Get the address.

438
00:36:21,848 --> 00:36:23,933
- Forget it.
- Why?

439
00:36:25,268 --> 00:36:27,354
It's Scully's cellular number.

440
00:36:27,437 --> 00:36:29,898
They're using her phone.
We can't trace them.

441
00:36:39,115 --> 00:36:42,535
<i>She's not happy, but... she's alive.</i>

442
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:47,040
<i>If I were you, I'd stop talking</i>
<i>and start passing around the collection hat.</i>

443
00:36:47,123 --> 00:36:50,210
- That last part?
- Yeah. Squelch the voice even more.

444
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:51,544
Yeah.

445
00:36:53,296 --> 00:36:55,048
Done.

446
00:36:55,131 --> 00:37:00,387
<i>If I were you, I'd stop talking</i>
<i>and start passing around the collection hat.</i>

447
00:37:01,888 --> 00:37:03,890
Yep. Yep! There's something there.

448
00:37:03,973 --> 00:37:06,476
Definitely something at the high end.

449
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:12,607
Let me throw on an extra Z-14 filter...
and isolate everything over half a decibel.

450
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:18,571
<i>If I were you, I'd stop talking</i>
<i>and start passing around the collection hat.</i>

451
00:37:18,655 --> 00:37:21,074
There. That engine sound.

452
00:37:21,157 --> 00:37:23,576
Let's clean it up some more!

453
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:33,837
<i>- If I were you, I'd stop talking and...</i>

454
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:36,172
Is that a small plane?

455
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,426
Taking off, by the sound of it.

456
00:37:39,509 --> 00:37:42,512
Give me a minute to guess
the altitude within 200ft!

457
00:37:42,637 --> 00:37:44,681
Great!

458
00:37:47,684 --> 00:37:52,188
All right, people! Settle down, grab a seat.
Mulder says he's got something.

459
00:37:52,313 --> 00:37:56,526
What? An alien virus, or new information
on the Kennedy assassination?

460
00:37:56,651 --> 00:37:58,695
Hey, Mulder's all right.

461
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:02,991
Pay attention,
you might learn something from the man.

462
00:38:05,452 --> 00:38:09,956
From our last phone contact, we've
identified what sounds like light aircraft.

463
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:15,128
Now, Washington County Regional Airport
happens to fall within our area.

464
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:17,297
Since takeoffs are north to south...

465
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:21,050
...it's a fair bet that our target area
lies along this flight path.

466
00:38:22,051 --> 00:38:27,140
For those who remember math, that gives
us an area of three square miles to cover.

467
00:38:27,223 --> 00:38:29,642
Roughly 1,000 households.

468
00:38:29,726 --> 00:38:32,312
With 100 law enforcement officials...

469
00:38:32,395 --> 00:38:34,355
...at about 30 households per man per hour,

470
00:38:34,439 --> 00:38:38,318
we can canvass the entire area
in three hours.

471
00:38:38,401 --> 00:38:41,905
Bruskin will grid the target area
and divide it among the teams.

472
00:38:41,988 --> 00:38:45,909
For those of you... who don't know
already, this one's important to me.

473
00:38:45,992 --> 00:38:49,037
So, um... let's do it right. Thanks.

474
00:38:51,873 --> 00:38:55,460
Let me see Steinberg, Calder, Westin,
Stipley and Mackowitz...

475
00:39:00,423 --> 00:39:02,509
<i>- </i> Scully?
- Huh?

476
00:39:05,053 --> 00:39:07,180
Was there snow?

477
00:39:10,058 --> 00:39:12,101
Yes... Jack.

478
00:39:12,227 --> 00:39:14,729
There was lots of snow.

479
00:39:16,564 --> 00:39:19,609
- I can't...
- It was December.

480
00:39:19,734 --> 00:39:22,237
It was the weekend after Thanksgiving.

481
00:39:24,531 --> 00:39:26,616
I remember...

482
00:39:27,283 --> 00:39:29,410
...a red stove.

483
00:39:30,203 --> 00:39:32,288
Yeah... That's right.

484
00:39:32,372 --> 00:39:37,210
There was a... There was a wood-burning
stove right in the middle of the room.

485
00:39:38,127 --> 00:39:39,879
Cold, hm?

486
00:39:40,755 --> 00:39:42,799
- Yeah.
- So cold...

487
00:39:43,925 --> 00:39:47,637
I remember... I had to wrap you
in a blanket...

488
00:39:47,762 --> 00:39:50,390
...when the wood ran out.

489
00:39:50,473 --> 00:39:52,267
Yeah.

490
00:39:55,228 --> 00:39:58,731
No... Jack! Don't close your eyes.

491
00:39:58,815 --> 00:40:01,568
Come on, keep talking.

492
00:40:01,651 --> 00:40:03,570
Jack, keep talking! Come on!

493
00:40:03,653 --> 00:40:06,322
Down on the floor, now!
Now, or you're dead!

494
00:40:06,447 --> 00:40:08,908
- I'm gonna execute every one of you!
- No!

495
00:40:09,659 --> 00:40:10,910
No!

496
00:40:12,453 --> 00:40:15,498
Shut up and do it!

497
00:40:27,343 --> 00:40:30,847
Just a second! Who is it?

498
00:40:30,972 --> 00:40:34,642
<i>It's Brother Tate. Could I speak with</i>
<i>you forjust one moment, please?</i>

499
00:40:36,185 --> 00:40:38,187
What do you want?

500
00:40:38,271 --> 00:40:42,358
Just a few minutes of your time, ma'am.
Beautiful day, isn't it?

501
00:40:42,483 --> 00:40:45,361
I wonder if I can interest you
in the word of the Lord?

502
00:40:45,486 --> 00:40:47,447
Leather-bound, in black or red. Your choice.

503
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:49,032
Go away!

504
00:40:54,537 --> 00:40:56,664
This is 1-4. Target sighted.

505
00:41:05,548 --> 00:41:08,843
Well... I guess it's time to make that call.

506
00:41:10,345 --> 00:41:12,972
He's dead.

507
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:15,975
It's all on you now.

508
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:18,186
He's dead because of you.

509
00:41:23,858 --> 00:41:25,902
Well...

510
00:41:26,027 --> 00:41:27,570
Guess it's over.

511
00:41:28,696 --> 00:41:31,699
Whoever you are.

512
00:41:33,409 --> 00:41:35,578
- Agh!
- Don't move!

513
00:41:35,703 --> 00:41:37,747
- Jack!
- Shut up!

514
00:41:38,665 --> 00:41:40,833
I love you.

515
00:41:40,917 --> 00:41:42,418
Don't you know?

516
00:41:42,502 --> 00:41:45,338
You're why I came back.

517
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:54,764
This is Westin.

518
00:41:54,889 --> 00:41:57,433
<i>They've battened down the hatches.</i>
<i>No clear shot from this side.</i>

519
00:41:57,517 --> 00:41:59,727
<i>What about you guys?</i>

520
00:42:01,270 --> 00:42:04,565
Ditto. Hold your positions
and keep radios at two.

521
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:26,546
- How do we look?
- Backup's in.

522
00:42:26,629 --> 00:42:29,841
- But we still don't know what's going on.
- We will soon enough.

523
00:42:30,174 --> 00:42:33,636
I kept a bottle of medicine
in the other room. I'll go get it.

524
00:42:33,761 --> 00:42:35,805
What do you say, huh?

525
00:42:36,472 --> 00:42:38,558
I'll get it for you.

526
00:42:38,641 --> 00:42:40,727
Look! Look! Look!

527
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:42,895
Look, I love you.

528
00:42:42,979 --> 00:42:45,064
- I love you, baby.
- No...

529
00:42:45,148 --> 00:42:47,817
Listen! Listen, we... we still have her.

530
00:42:48,484 --> 00:42:50,570
We can get away with this.

531
00:42:50,653 --> 00:42:53,406
I don't think so, baby. Not this time.

532
00:42:53,489 --> 00:42:55,324
Jack, put the gun down!

533
00:42:55,408 --> 00:42:59,328
You remember that... that
light that I talked about?

534
00:42:59,412 --> 00:43:01,956
<i>- </i> No...
- It's beautiful.

535
00:43:04,125 --> 00:43:07,420
- There's nothing to be afraid of.

536
00:43:07,503 --> 00:43:09,422
- No!
- FBI!

537
00:43:09,505 --> 00:43:10,757
Freeze!

538
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,759
Jack!

539
00:43:12,842 --> 00:43:14,510
FBI!

540
00:43:19,474 --> 00:43:21,517
Scully. Are you OK?

541
00:43:22,810 --> 00:43:24,854
Jack?!

542
00:43:42,955 --> 00:43:47,627
Hi. I got this from the morgue, along
with the rest of his personal effects.

543
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:49,879
- I thought you might want it.
- Mm.

544
00:43:51,005 --> 00:43:53,049
"Happy 35th. Love D."

545
00:43:54,217 --> 00:43:56,677
I got it for him three years ago.

546
00:43:57,804 --> 00:43:59,806
Next of kin?

547
00:43:59,889 --> 00:44:02,141
Uh... no.

548
00:44:02,225 --> 00:44:05,645
Jack was an only child.
His parents died when he was in college.

549
00:44:05,728 --> 00:44:08,898
There's a... kid over in Parklawn.

550
00:44:09,023 --> 00:44:13,402
Jack's been his big brother,
so I'm going to go and see him tomorrow.

551
00:44:14,570 --> 00:44:18,074
- What am I gonna tell him?
- The official story.

552
00:44:18,199 --> 00:44:20,243
Which is?

553
00:44:20,368 --> 00:44:23,746
Fugitive Lula Phillips died in
a shoot-out with federal agents.

554
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:28,334
It also resulted in the death of Special Agent
Jack Willis - killed in the line of duty.

555
00:44:34,549 --> 00:44:37,552
What am I supposed to tell myself?

556
00:44:40,930 --> 00:44:42,765
Good night.

557
00:44:45,268 --> 00:44:48,187
It's not working. It stopped.

558
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:53,192
At 6.47.

559
00:44:53,276 --> 00:44:57,280
The exact time that Jack
went into cardiac arrest at the hospital.

560
00:44:57,363 --> 00:44:59,198
What does that mean?

561
00:44:59,282 --> 00:45:01,367
It means...

562
00:45:03,703 --> 00:45:06,122
It means whatever you want it to mean.

563
00:45:08,291 --> 00:45:10,376
Good night.

564
00:45:50,166 --> 00:45:51,167
I made this!
