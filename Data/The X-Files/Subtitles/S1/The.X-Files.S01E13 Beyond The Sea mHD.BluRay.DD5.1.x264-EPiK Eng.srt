1
00:00:07,217 --> 00:00:09,386
Are you gonna leave this up all year?

2
00:00:09,469 --> 00:00:12,181
Yup. All year.

3
00:00:12,264 --> 00:00:15,934
You always made us take the tree down
the day after Christmas.

4
00:00:16,018 --> 00:00:18,020
I'm making up for lost time.

5
00:00:18,103 --> 00:00:22,608
If your idea of a good time is to pick up
dried pine needles, treat yourself.

6
00:00:23,692 --> 00:00:26,653
As if he's an authority on having a good time!

7
00:00:27,613 --> 00:00:29,948
- That's OK, Mom, I got that.
- Oh. OK.

8
00:00:30,032 --> 00:00:32,284
OK, Maggie. Let's shove off.

9
00:00:33,076 --> 00:00:35,162
Oh. OK.

10
00:00:35,245 --> 00:00:38,790
Thank you for having us.
Dinner was delicious, as usual.

11
00:00:38,874 --> 00:00:40,959
Thanks, Mom.

12
00:00:43,128 --> 00:00:45,214
Good sailing, Ahab.

13
00:00:45,297 --> 00:00:47,591
Good night, Starbuck.

14
00:00:52,638 --> 00:00:54,723
How's work? Good?

15
00:00:54,806 --> 00:00:57,559
Yup. It's good.

16
00:00:58,977 --> 00:01:01,230
Well...

17
00:01:05,943 --> 00:01:08,195
- Well, drive carefully.
- Uh-huh.

18
00:01:13,825 --> 00:01:15,911
Good night, Daddy.

19
00:01:21,667 --> 00:01:23,752
<i>Applause)</i>

20
00:01:23,835 --> 00:01:28,840
<i>Here on "Incredible Inventions", you're not</i>
<i>going to spend $110 for it. You all know that.</i>

21
00:01:28,924 --> 00:01:31,051
<i>You're not even going to spend $100.</i>

22
00:01:31,134 --> 00:01:34,179
<i>There's an approximate</i>
<i>one month supply here.</i>

23
00:01:34,263 --> 00:01:38,308
<i>And all you'll spend for this</i>

24
00:01:50,737 --> 00:01:52,823
Dad?

25
00:01:54,783 --> 00:01:56,868
I thought you guys left.

26
00:01:58,328 --> 00:02:00,122
Where's Mom?

27
00:02:19,308 --> 00:02:21,393
- Hello?

28
00:02:22,936 --> 00:02:25,022
- Hello?

29
00:02:27,274 --> 00:02:29,359
<i>Dana?</i>

30
00:02:29,443 --> 00:02:32,029
Mom? What's the matter?

31
00:02:33,405 --> 00:02:35,490
<i>He, um...</i>

32
00:02:37,159 --> 00:02:39,244
<i>We lost your dad.</i>

33
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:45,292
<i>He had, uh...</i>
<i>a massive coronary about an hour ago.</i>

34
00:02:48,628 --> 00:02:50,964
<i>He's gone.</i>

35
00:04:01,493 --> 00:04:03,578
I swear! Christmas Day!

36
00:04:04,955 --> 00:04:07,833
My whole family's opening presents an' all.

37
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,673
And I'm just sitting there in my own little
world, thinking, "I just wish Jim were here."

38
00:04:14,756 --> 00:04:16,383
I know.

39
00:04:23,432 --> 00:04:25,600
Oh, man! Busted!

40
00:04:29,521 --> 00:04:31,898
- Yes, sir?
- Out of the vehicle, please.

41
00:04:31,982 --> 00:04:35,235
Sir, I'm... I'm sorry. We'll be on our way.

42
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:38,029
I said, out of the vehicle.

43
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:51,084
Keep your hands down.

44
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:56,882
Let's see some ID.

45
00:04:56,965 --> 00:04:59,593
No, not till I see yours.

46
00:05:03,597 --> 00:05:06,725
Jim!

47
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:24,117
Last time you were that engrossed,
you were reading <i>Adult Video News!</i>

48
00:05:25,494 --> 00:05:27,621
I didn't think you'd be in today.

49
00:05:28,955 --> 00:05:31,041
How are you, Dana?

50
00:05:31,124 --> 00:05:33,210
Dana...

51
00:05:33,293 --> 00:05:36,379
I'm fine, thank you.
What are you working on?

52
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:41,635
Two days ago, a couple was kidnapped
at Jackson University.

53
00:05:41,718 --> 00:05:43,887
Elizabeth Hawley and James Summers.

54
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,764
Both nineteen.

55
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:48,058
Last year another couple was kidnapped.

56
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:51,353
Except that abduction
occurred at Duke University.

57
00:05:51,436 --> 00:05:54,898
One week later,
they found both students' bodies - dead.

58
00:05:54,981 --> 00:05:58,235
They were kept alive and tortured
during that period.

59
00:05:58,318 --> 00:06:00,403
No arrests were ever made.

60
00:06:00,487 --> 00:06:05,200
Police believed it to be a one-time offender.
Now it appears to be a serial incident.

61
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:08,995
If he holds true to form,
we have five days to find those kids.

62
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:11,164
That's a grim deadline.

63
00:06:11,248 --> 00:06:13,333
Here's another grim deadline.

64
00:06:15,877 --> 00:06:20,715
In one week, Luther Lee Boggs will take a
seat in the North Carolina gas chamber.

65
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:22,926
How is he related?

66
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:26,721
He claims to have information
relating to the kidnapping.

67
00:06:26,805 --> 00:06:29,015
He described Hawley's bracelet exactly.

68
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:33,019
This is information that only
family members could have known.

69
00:06:33,103 --> 00:06:34,854
Or the kidnapper.

70
00:06:35,939 --> 00:06:39,109
Boggs feels that if his talents
help save these kids...

71
00:06:39,192 --> 00:06:42,112
...his sentence should be
reduced to life in prison.

72
00:06:42,195 --> 00:06:44,281
His "talents"?

73
00:06:44,364 --> 00:06:49,411
He claims to have obtained this information
through psychic transmissions.

74
00:06:50,745 --> 00:06:53,748
Mulder, do I detect a hint of scepticism?

75
00:06:53,832 --> 00:06:55,500
Perhaps.

76
00:06:55,584 --> 00:06:57,669
Boggs has been there before.

77
00:06:57,752 --> 00:06:59,629
In the chamber.

78
00:06:59,713 --> 00:07:01,881
My profile helped send him there.

79
00:07:01,965 --> 00:07:06,886
He was actually strapped to the chair,
before receiving an executive stay.

80
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:12,684
He claims that this experience activated in
him the ability to channel spirits and demons.

81
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:15,312
I believe in psychic ability, without a doubt.

82
00:07:15,395 --> 00:07:18,815
But not in this case. Not Boggs.

83
00:07:18,898 --> 00:07:23,820
So you believe that Boggs is orchestrating
the kidnapping from the inside?

84
00:07:23,903 --> 00:07:25,989
A scam to save his life?

85
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:31,119
At the age of six...

86
00:07:31,202 --> 00:07:35,165
...Luther Boggs slaughtered
every pet animal on his housing project.

87
00:07:35,248 --> 00:07:38,918
When he was 30, he strangled
five family members over dinner...

88
00:07:39,002 --> 00:07:41,796
...and then watched
the Detroit-Green Bay game.

89
00:07:42,881 --> 00:07:45,842
Some killers are products of society.

90
00:07:45,925 --> 00:07:48,553
Some act out past abuses.

91
00:07:49,763 --> 00:07:51,848
Boggs kills because he likes it.

92
00:07:54,601 --> 00:07:56,978
And they've requested you speak with him?

93
00:07:57,062 --> 00:08:00,273
Actually, he's requested to speak to me.

94
00:08:00,357 --> 00:08:02,359
Why you?

95
00:08:02,442 --> 00:08:04,527
He read my profile on him...

96
00:08:04,611 --> 00:08:08,615
...and he feels like I'm the only one
who truly understands what he is.

97
00:08:08,698 --> 00:08:11,701
- I leave for Raleigh this afternoon.
- I'll go with you.

98
00:08:13,828 --> 00:08:16,122
The funeral's at noon.

99
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:20,293
I think you should take some time.

100
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:24,714
- I need to work.
- I'm sorry about your father.

101
00:08:30,804 --> 00:08:32,889
- I'll see you later.
- OK.

102
00:09:10,468 --> 00:09:15,432
As a captain, he was entitled to burial
in Arlington, with full ceremony.

103
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:19,436
This is exactly the way he wanted it.

104
00:09:20,687 --> 00:09:22,814
Just the family.

105
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:42,542
This song was playing when his ship
returned from the Cuban blockade.

106
00:09:43,293 --> 00:09:45,754
He marched right off, up to me...

107
00:09:47,756 --> 00:09:49,841
...and he proposed.

108
00:09:53,803 --> 00:09:55,889
I know that you and Dad were...

109
00:09:57,807 --> 00:10:01,478
...disappointed that I chose
the path I'm on, instead of medicine.

110
00:10:01,561 --> 00:10:03,646
But I need to know...

111
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:09,527
...was he at all proud of me?

112
00:10:12,113 --> 00:10:14,699
He was your father.

113
00:10:16,868 --> 00:10:21,748
<i>..That we will be beyond the sea...</i>

114
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:30,799
The soul... of Luther Boggs...

115
00:10:31,758 --> 00:10:34,344
...drowns in hell's sea of fire.

116
00:10:40,975 --> 00:10:43,061
We have him now.

117
00:10:43,144 --> 00:10:45,230
"We"?

118
00:10:46,314 --> 00:10:48,566
You mean the souls of your victims?

119
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,948
The dead.

120
00:10:55,031 --> 00:10:57,116
The living.

121
00:10:57,659 --> 00:10:59,619
All souls are connected.

122
00:10:59,702 --> 00:11:02,205
And you're the conduit?

123
00:11:08,086 --> 00:11:10,171
Uh...

124
00:11:10,797 --> 00:11:12,882
...Dana...

125
00:11:13,716 --> 00:11:15,802
...Fox...

126
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:20,557
...please understand that from here
we can return to the past...

127
00:11:21,975 --> 00:11:24,185
...we can see the present...

128
00:11:24,269 --> 00:11:26,312
...we can know the future...

129
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:31,109
"From here"? Where exactly are you?

130
00:11:42,328 --> 00:11:46,082
Mr Boggs must be made redemptive...

131
00:11:46,165 --> 00:11:49,085
...for his transgressions.

132
00:11:49,168 --> 00:11:53,798
That's exactly what the State of
North Carolina intends to do next week.

133
00:11:58,052 --> 00:12:00,138
Uh-uh.

134
00:12:00,763 --> 00:12:02,849
Let's deal.

135
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,228
Boggs' life... for the kids.
You know what I'm saying?

136
00:12:07,312 --> 00:12:10,815
First you gotta prove you're telling the truth.

137
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:19,198
Don't get me wrong, Luther.

138
00:12:21,743 --> 00:12:23,828
I wanna believe.

139
00:12:31,377 --> 00:12:33,463
Oh...

140
00:12:34,464 --> 00:12:36,215
Ohh...

141
00:12:36,299 --> 00:12:39,844
Ohhh... God! No!

142
00:12:39,928 --> 00:12:43,890
Must stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!!

143
00:12:43,973 --> 00:12:46,059
Pain!

144
00:12:46,142 --> 00:12:48,645
I'm in... pain. Terrible pain.

145
00:12:48,728 --> 00:12:51,981
Uh... the boy...

146
00:12:52,065 --> 00:12:54,150
Uh...

147
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:56,319
...Jim...

148
00:12:56,402 --> 00:12:58,488
He's tied with, uh... twine.

149
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:01,115
Packing twine.

150
00:13:03,076 --> 00:13:04,118
God!

151
00:13:04,661 --> 00:13:05,703
God!

152
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:07,497
God!

153
00:13:11,417 --> 00:13:16,172
He whups him with a coat hanger,
a wire coat hanger.

154
00:13:19,092 --> 00:13:21,177
Oh...

155
00:13:23,596 --> 00:13:25,682
Uh...

156
00:13:32,855 --> 00:13:34,941
Dark place.

157
00:13:36,109 --> 00:13:38,194
Cold.

158
00:13:40,738 --> 00:13:42,824
Cellar.

159
00:13:44,993 --> 00:13:47,078
Warehouse, condemned.

160
00:13:52,834 --> 00:13:54,919
An angel...

161
00:13:55,712 --> 00:13:58,214
...of, uh... stone.

162
00:13:58,297 --> 00:14:00,758
Waterfall.

163
00:14:00,842 --> 00:14:02,927
Water falling.

164
00:14:04,303 --> 00:14:06,389
It's not a waterfall. Not water.

165
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:12,145
They're there.

166
00:14:16,899 --> 00:14:18,985
Oh, God... I gotta go.

167
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:22,405
I gotta go.

168
00:14:22,822 --> 00:14:24,907
I gotta go.

169
00:14:38,129 --> 00:14:40,840
I tore this off my New York Knicks T-shirt.

170
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:45,386
It has nothing to do with the crime.

171
00:14:59,067 --> 00:15:01,152
Somewhere...

172
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:04,989
...beyond the sea

173
00:15:06,741 --> 00:15:09,243
Somewhere... away from me

174
00:15:21,339 --> 00:15:23,966
Did you get my message, Starbuck?

175
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:31,641
Thanks a lot.

176
00:15:31,724 --> 00:15:33,810
Scully? What's wrong?

177
00:15:35,937 --> 00:15:38,231
Did Boggs say something to you?

178
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:41,692
No.

179
00:15:41,776 --> 00:15:46,239
- It's my father. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- It's all right.

180
00:15:46,322 --> 00:15:48,491
Why don't you go back to the motel?

181
00:15:50,243 --> 00:15:52,286
We've exposed Boggs as a fraud.

182
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:54,455
Boggs is not what he claims to be.

183
00:15:54,539 --> 00:15:56,874
He may be orchestrating the kidnapping.

184
00:15:56,958 --> 00:16:01,379
Now he knows we're onto him, he doesn't
have a chance with this charade.

185
00:16:01,462 --> 00:16:03,840
I'm gonna wait around and interrogate him.

186
00:16:03,923 --> 00:16:07,009
Hopefully, he'll tell me where the kids are.

187
00:16:08,136 --> 00:16:11,806
Somewhere... beyond the shore

188
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:15,434
We'll kiss just as before

189
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:18,813
Happy we'll be

190
00:16:18,896 --> 00:16:20,982
Beyond the sea

191
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,110
And never again...

192
00:16:33,244 --> 00:16:36,664
Water falling. Not a waterfall.

193
00:16:44,881 --> 00:16:46,966
An angel of stone.

194
00:18:22,478 --> 00:18:24,855
Mulder!

195
00:18:30,069 --> 00:18:34,657
Liz Hawley's family made a positive ID
on the charm you found at the warehouse.

196
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:39,620
The police are searching the place inch
by inch, but haven't found anything yet.

197
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,208
I expected to find you at the crime scene.

198
00:18:45,084 --> 00:18:47,169
Did Boggs confess?

199
00:18:47,253 --> 00:18:50,965
No. No, it was five hours
of Boggs's "channelling".

200
00:18:52,216 --> 00:18:56,178
After three hours, I asked him to
summon up the soul of Jimi Hendrix...

201
00:18:56,262 --> 00:18:58,848
...and requested "All Along The Watchtower"!

202
00:18:58,931 --> 00:19:02,518
He's been dead 20 years,
but still hasn't lost his edge!

203
00:19:03,561 --> 00:19:06,897
I lied to the police about
how I found the warehouse.

204
00:19:07,398 --> 00:19:11,819
- I didn't notice any "suspicious activities".
- Then how did you find it?

205
00:19:12,695 --> 00:19:14,780
It was where Boggs said it would be.

206
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:17,658
Scully, I told you about Boggs!

207
00:19:17,742 --> 00:19:22,330
I didn't go looking for it! I came across
an area that had landmarks he spoke of.

208
00:19:22,413 --> 00:19:27,460
That's exactly what Boggs wanted! He could
have been setting you up. You could be dead!

209
00:19:31,422 --> 00:19:34,759
Why did you feel
you had to lie on your police report?

210
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:38,971
It was a better explanation
under the circumstances.

211
00:19:39,055 --> 00:19:43,267
You didn't want to go on record
admitting that you believed in Boggs.

212
00:19:43,351 --> 00:19:48,606
The Bureau would expect something like that
from spooky Mulder, but not Dana Scully.

213
00:19:51,817 --> 00:19:57,031
I thought that you'd be pleased that I'd
opened myself to extreme possibilities.

214
00:19:57,114 --> 00:19:59,200
Why now?!

215
00:19:59,283 --> 00:20:01,243
After all we've seen. Why Boggs?

216
00:20:07,541 --> 00:20:09,960
Does this have to do with your father?

217
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:14,965
You said that he didn't approve
of you becoming an FBI agent.

218
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:19,720
If being on the job now makes you feel
guilty or uncomfortable or uneasy...

219
00:20:19,804 --> 00:20:22,014
...I think you should back away.

220
00:20:22,098 --> 00:20:25,142
Because if it's clouding your judgment...

221
00:20:25,226 --> 00:20:27,395
...you're putting yourself in danger.

222
00:20:28,979 --> 00:20:31,982
- I love this job.
- You love your father.

223
00:20:37,363 --> 00:20:43,577
Dana... open yourself up to extreme
possibilities only when they're the truth.

224
00:20:43,661 --> 00:20:47,456
That goes for Luther Boggs... <i>and</i> your father.

225
00:20:52,378 --> 00:20:55,881
As for Luther Boggs...
he's the greatest of lies.

226
00:20:58,843 --> 00:21:03,639
I know he's working with someone on
the outside and they planted that evidence.

227
00:21:03,722 --> 00:21:09,145
We have to be very careful about plotting our
next move - he's planned five steps ahead.

228
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:11,772
The only advantage we have is time.

229
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,740
Scully, take a look at this.

230
00:21:21,824 --> 00:21:23,576
That's incredible!

231
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:25,494
They found them?

232
00:21:25,578 --> 00:21:30,458
- That's exactly what I want Boggs to think.
- Why didn't the police notify us?

233
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:36,088
The article is bogus. <i>The Carolinian</i> made it
up for us. Only six people know about it.

234
00:21:36,172 --> 00:21:39,842
Later on today,
Boggs gets his weekly phone privileges.

235
00:21:39,925 --> 00:21:42,553
Hopefully, he'll call his accomplice.

236
00:21:56,358 --> 00:21:58,444
Phone privileges in two hours.

237
00:22:23,219 --> 00:22:25,554
Go.

238
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:34,605
Turn off that phone. Turn it off.

239
00:22:35,773 --> 00:22:37,858
Mulder, it's you.

240
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:47,284
- Mulder.
<i>- How come you don't believe me?</i>

241
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,621
<i>Agent Scully does.</i>

242
00:22:50,704 --> 00:22:53,374
<i>She believes me.</i>

243
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:58,462
Agent Scully believes what we all
believe - that you have the kids.

244
00:22:58,546 --> 00:23:00,631
Now, where are they?

245
00:23:00,714 --> 00:23:02,800
<i>Oh...</i>

246
00:23:07,137 --> 00:23:12,268
Mulder... even if he <i>is</i> setting us up,
we have to follow, because in three days...

247
00:23:12,351 --> 00:23:14,895
Liz Hawley and Jim Summers will be dead.

248
00:23:15,604 --> 00:23:21,068
A day later, our only connection to the case
will be pulling up a chair at the gas chamber.

249
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:23,237
We have to deal.

250
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:32,121
The kidnapper's aroused by
the prospect of becoming a killer.

251
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:34,790
What's the name?

252
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:38,335
Can't see. Male.

253
00:23:38,419 --> 00:23:41,130
Describe him.

254
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,632
Small...

255
00:23:43,716 --> 00:23:45,801
Thin...

256
00:23:47,136 --> 00:23:49,221
Late twenties.

257
00:23:50,097 --> 00:23:52,016
Skull. Human skull.

258
00:23:53,892 --> 00:23:55,978
Silver grey.

259
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:59,898
His eyes... cold, very cold...

260
00:23:59,982 --> 00:24:02,192
...staring at Elizabeth.

261
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:07,281
God! He's got the wire!

262
00:24:07,364 --> 00:24:11,577
Oh! Please! No!

263
00:24:17,708 --> 00:24:19,501
Where is he?

264
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:23,505
He's...

265
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:26,508
...over... by the window.

266
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:31,513
<i>Holding back... holding back</i>
<i>his thoughts of killing.</i>

267
00:24:35,017 --> 00:24:37,645
<i>Waiting.</i>

268
00:24:37,728 --> 00:24:41,065
There's a small boathouse on Lake Jordan.

269
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:43,233
You got that?

270
00:24:47,821 --> 00:24:49,406
Mulder.

271
00:24:50,991 --> 00:24:53,118
Don't go near the white cross.

272
00:24:53,202 --> 00:24:55,287
We see you down...

273
00:24:56,622 --> 00:24:59,416
...and your blood spills on the white cross.

274
00:25:14,515 --> 00:25:16,600
No! No!

275
00:25:32,241 --> 00:25:33,701
Sweep the docks!

276
00:25:55,764 --> 00:25:57,099
Federal agent!

277
00:25:57,182 --> 00:25:58,475
Arghh!

278
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,060
Mulder!

279
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:11,905
We need an ambulance! Officer down!

280
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:42,603
<i>- </i> What have we got?
<i>- </i> Through and through.

281
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:46,690
Let's get him on the gurney.

282
00:27:00,037 --> 00:27:02,122
No.

283
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:05,417
No.

284
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:09,797
No.

285
00:27:18,764 --> 00:27:20,849
Lucas Jackson Henry, 28.

286
00:27:22,392 --> 00:27:27,147
Did some time at Angola in Louisiana
for sexual assault, narcotics. Nothing big.

287
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:30,984
His personal history includes
being witness to an auto accident...

288
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:35,531
...in which his high-school sweetheart
was killed and his mother decapitated.

289
00:27:35,614 --> 00:27:40,077
The seven-year anniversary
of that accident is in three days.

290
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,246
He's reliving it.

291
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:48,460
That would explain the deadline.

292
00:27:48,544 --> 00:27:52,965
The most important element we found
is there's substantial suspicion...

293
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:56,677
that Boggs' last five murders
were committed with a partner.

294
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,389
The police in Durham say they
could never prove it in court...

295
00:28:00,472 --> 00:28:03,016
...but they know that partner was Lucas Henry.

296
00:28:12,609 --> 00:28:16,154
You set us up. You're in
on this with Lucas Henry.

297
00:28:16,238 --> 00:28:19,825
This was a trap for Mulder
because he helped put you away.

298
00:28:19,908 --> 00:28:21,994
Well, I came here to tell you...

299
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:25,330
...that if he dies because
of what you've done...

300
00:28:25,414 --> 00:28:30,961
...four days from now, nobody will stop me
from being the one that throws the switch...

301
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:35,090
...and gases you out of this life
for good, you son of a bitch!!

302
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:37,634
Dana...

303
00:28:37,718 --> 00:28:39,720
...you're the one that believed me.

304
00:28:41,597 --> 00:28:43,348
No!

305
00:28:43,432 --> 00:28:45,517
No, I do <i>not</i> believe you!

306
00:28:47,936 --> 00:28:50,022
You don't believe me?

307
00:28:50,105 --> 00:28:52,190
Maybe you'll believe yourself.

308
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:08,665
There was that one time
when I was fourteen...

309
00:29:08,749 --> 00:29:10,834
...and my parents had gone to bed.

310
00:29:10,918 --> 00:29:14,212
I snuck downstairs all alone...

311
00:29:14,296 --> 00:29:19,051
...and got one of my mom's cigarettes
and went out onto the porch in the dark.

312
00:29:20,177 --> 00:29:22,262
I was <i>so</i> scared.

313
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:27,643
My heart was beating -
they would have killed me if they knew.

314
00:29:29,937 --> 00:29:32,648
But I was <i>so</i> excited.

315
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:37,069
Not because of the cigarette -
I mean, it was gross -

316
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:39,488
...but because I wasn't supposed to.

317
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,995
That could be a moment from any kid's life.

318
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:49,414
I know what you want.

319
00:29:49,498 --> 00:29:51,583
And I know who you want to talk to.

320
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:56,713
Why don't you just go ahead and ask me?

321
00:29:59,967 --> 00:30:02,844
I'll believe you...

322
00:30:02,928 --> 00:30:06,890
...if you let... me talk to him.

323
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:42,426
Starbuck...

324
00:30:56,982 --> 00:30:59,526
No! No! No!

325
00:31:00,569 --> 00:31:05,574
No... body talks to anybody until I get a deal.

326
00:31:08,702 --> 00:31:12,998
Don't... underestimate my fear of dying...

327
00:31:13,081 --> 00:31:18,754
...and <i>don't</i> downplay my terror
of going back to that chair.

328
00:31:20,172 --> 00:31:26,053
I know my hell's going to be to go on back to
that chair over and over again for all of time.

329
00:31:26,136 --> 00:31:30,182
But in this life, my one and only life...

330
00:31:30,265 --> 00:31:33,018
...I don't <i>ever</i> want to go back again!

331
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:34,644
Ever!

332
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:42,402
The last time that I went to
death's door and looked inside...

333
00:31:42,486 --> 00:31:47,240
<i>I ain't never talked to a minister before</i>
<i>in my life. Ever.</i>

334
00:31:48,241 --> 00:31:50,327
<i>Till that day.</i>

335
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:54,873
<i>And he said, "He who doth not love...</i>

336
00:31:54,956 --> 00:31:57,042
<i>..remains in death."</i>

337
00:31:58,418 --> 00:32:03,006
<i>"And he who hates his brother...</i>
<i>is a murderer...</i>

338
00:32:03,090 --> 00:32:06,426
<i>..and no murderer</i>
<i>has eternal life abiding in him."</i>

339
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:11,848
<i>My family, who I killed after their last meal...</i>

340
00:32:13,934 --> 00:32:16,770
<i>.. was right there to watch me over mine.</i>

341
00:32:18,563 --> 00:32:22,275
<i>And their... fear...</i>

342
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:24,778
<i>..and their horror...</i>

343
00:32:24,861 --> 00:32:29,032
<i>..that I made them feel</i>
<i>when I killed them...</i>

344
00:32:29,116 --> 00:32:31,368
<i>.. was injected into me!</i>

345
00:32:31,451 --> 00:32:37,374
<i>And their collective fear alone</i>
<i>was this long taste of hell.</i>

346
00:32:41,628 --> 00:32:43,964
<i>And then I felt myself leave my body.</i>

347
00:32:45,799 --> 00:32:48,301
<i>But I thought they'd already killed me.</i>

348
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:50,470
<i>And I saw...</i>

349
00:32:51,346 --> 00:32:55,559
<i>..thousands of souls rushing at my body.</i>

350
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,359
It is a cold...

351
00:33:04,442 --> 00:33:06,945
...dark place, Scully.

352
00:33:08,446 --> 00:33:10,782
Mulder's looking in on it right now.

353
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:15,036
It may be a cold, dark place for you...

354
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:18,832
...but it's not for Mulder.

355
00:33:18,915 --> 00:33:21,126
And it's not for my father.

356
00:33:21,209 --> 00:33:23,712
I'm sure he'd like to tell you hisself.

357
00:33:23,795 --> 00:33:25,881
But I'm not gonna let him.

358
00:33:29,176 --> 00:33:32,179
Nobody speaks till you give me a deal.

359
00:33:33,638 --> 00:33:35,724
I don't believe you.

360
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:42,480
Oh, well, there's plenty of room in that cold,
dark place for liars, Scully.

361
00:33:44,691 --> 00:33:47,152
You go ahead and play it like you need to...

362
00:33:47,235 --> 00:33:49,237
...but I <i>know</i> you believe me.

363
00:33:50,864 --> 00:33:54,868
But if you need to convince a judge
I'm in on it with Lucas, go ahead.

364
00:33:54,951 --> 00:33:57,037
Cos either way...

365
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,416
...whether I'm running the show
with Lucas or I'm channelling...

366
00:34:01,499 --> 00:34:04,377
...no information's coming till I get a deal.

367
00:34:04,461 --> 00:34:07,839
I got nothin' to lose!

368
00:34:11,384 --> 00:34:13,470
Guard!

369
00:34:15,513 --> 00:34:17,599
If I die...

370
00:34:18,183 --> 00:34:21,770
...that boy goes to a cold, dark place.

371
00:34:49,339 --> 00:34:51,841
The Governor and
the Supreme Court of North Carolina...

372
00:34:51,925 --> 00:34:54,844
...do not intend to make a deal
with a mass murderer.

373
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:58,723
Especially one who I know
is orchestrating a capital of fence...

374
00:34:58,807 --> 00:35:01,184
...two days before his capital punishment.

375
00:35:01,268 --> 00:35:02,268
Yes, sir.

376
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:05,105
All Boggs will get from me is a timely death.

377
00:35:05,188 --> 00:35:07,983
And it's an overdue one at that.

378
00:35:14,531 --> 00:35:16,616
We're running out of time.

379
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:20,870
There's still no sign of
Lucas Henry or Jim Summers.

380
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:27,210
- The Raleigh police said...
- No matter what, don't believe him.

381
00:35:29,129 --> 00:35:33,717
Boggs created this whole charade to
get back at me for putting him on death row.

382
00:35:37,387 --> 00:35:39,472
You'd be the next best thing.

383
00:35:40,724 --> 00:35:43,268
Mulder, I never thought I'd say this...

384
00:35:44,644 --> 00:35:47,314
...but what if there's another explanation?

385
00:35:47,397 --> 00:35:50,191
Don't... deal with him.

386
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:56,323
He could be trying to claim you
as his last victim.

387
00:36:13,882 --> 00:36:15,967
All right, Mr Boggs...

388
00:36:16,051 --> 00:36:18,303
...you got your deal.

389
00:36:25,018 --> 00:36:27,103
Thank you, ma'am.

390
00:36:28,271 --> 00:36:30,398
Thank you.

391
00:36:32,442 --> 00:36:35,570
All right, where are they?

392
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:46,664
Uh...

393
00:36:47,582 --> 00:36:49,667
Uh...

394
00:36:50,835 --> 00:36:53,588
Let's see, like, uh...

395
00:36:55,882 --> 00:36:57,967
Uh... circles.

396
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:03,181
Uh... I don't know, like... barrels.

397
00:37:04,808 --> 00:37:06,893
No. No, bigger...

398
00:37:06,976 --> 00:37:11,856
...like, uh... huge, uh... vats.

399
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:16,903
Factory.

400
00:37:16,986 --> 00:37:18,655
Condemned.

401
00:37:18,738 --> 00:37:20,824
The...

402
00:37:20,907 --> 00:37:22,992
...Old... Blue...

403
00:37:24,452 --> 00:37:27,872
...Devil Brewery, out by Morrisville.

404
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:32,168
Ah, God, he's getting... he's getting ready.

405
00:37:32,252 --> 00:37:34,337
He... He...

406
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:37,215
He's getting ready to, um... um...

407
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:41,719
He's getting ready to kill the...

408
00:37:58,486 --> 00:38:00,572
Luther, if you really were psychic...

409
00:38:00,655 --> 00:38:02,949
I'd have known you lied.

410
00:38:03,908 --> 00:38:06,286
That there never was a deal.

411
00:38:06,369 --> 00:38:09,289
I know you tried.

412
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:16,963
Scully.

413
00:38:18,298 --> 00:38:20,383
Avoid the Devil.

414
00:38:20,467 --> 00:38:23,178
Don't follow Henry to the Devil.

415
00:38:24,637 --> 00:38:26,890
Leave that to me.

416
00:39:06,804 --> 00:39:08,223
Freeze!

417
00:39:08,306 --> 00:39:10,141
Federal agents! We're armed!

418
00:39:12,268 --> 00:39:13,978
Drop your weapon.

419
00:39:44,175 --> 00:39:45,843
Go!

420
00:40:14,122 --> 00:40:17,166
Arrggghh!

421
00:40:53,745 --> 00:40:56,748
You come to say goodbye?

422
00:40:58,708 --> 00:41:00,960
I believe...

423
00:41:03,379 --> 00:41:06,799
...that if you had orchestrated
this kidnapping...

424
00:41:08,885 --> 00:41:14,641
...Lucas Henry would have been aware of
the danger you warned me about.

425
00:41:16,643 --> 00:41:20,021
He never would have crossed that bridge.

426
00:41:22,315 --> 00:41:26,069
So you saved... Jim Summers' life.

427
00:41:31,616 --> 00:41:33,701
But you saved mine as well.

428
00:41:47,173 --> 00:41:49,801
You come for some unfinished business.

429
00:41:51,719 --> 00:41:53,805
You want your father's message.

430
00:41:56,015 --> 00:41:58,101
Not now.

431
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:02,146
You be there tonight - my witness.

432
00:42:04,148 --> 00:42:06,776
When they got me in that chair and they...

433
00:42:08,611 --> 00:42:10,697
...open up that shield...

434
00:42:14,242 --> 00:42:16,327
...you'll get your message.

435
00:43:25,021 --> 00:43:28,858
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be thy name.

436
00:43:28,941 --> 00:43:32,820
Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done
on earth, as it is in heaven.

437
00:43:32,904 --> 00:43:35,740
Would you like to make a statement?

438
00:43:35,823 --> 00:43:40,119
And forgive us our trespasses,
as we forgive those that trespass against us.

439
00:43:40,203 --> 00:43:43,581
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil:

440
00:43:43,664 --> 00:43:47,335
For thine is the kingdom,
the power, and the glory...

441
00:43:48,127 --> 00:43:50,838
...for ever and ever. Amen.

442
00:44:03,935 --> 00:44:06,020
I was considering Boggs.

443
00:44:07,313 --> 00:44:09,732
If he knew that I was your partner...

444
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:14,570
...he could have found out everything
he knew about me - about my father...

445
00:44:14,654 --> 00:44:17,907
- Scully.
- "Beyond The Sea" played at their wedding.

446
00:44:17,990 --> 00:44:22,662
Visions of deceased loved ones are
a common psychological phenomenon.

447
00:44:22,745 --> 00:44:25,289
- If he knew that my father had...
- Dana.

448
00:44:26,707 --> 00:44:28,793
After all you've seen...

449
00:44:28,876 --> 00:44:30,962
...after all the evidence...

450
00:44:31,045 --> 00:44:33,506
...why can't you believe?

451
00:44:41,639 --> 00:44:43,724
I'm afraid.

452
00:44:45,893 --> 00:44:47,979
I'm afraid to believe.

453
00:44:49,605 --> 00:44:51,691
You couldn't face that fear?

454
00:44:52,859 --> 00:44:57,154
Even if it meant never knowing
what your father wanted to tell you?

455
00:44:59,824 --> 00:45:02,034
But I do know.

456
00:45:02,118 --> 00:45:03,870
How?

457
00:45:08,332 --> 00:45:10,501
He was my father.

458
