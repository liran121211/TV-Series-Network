1
00:00:35,037 --> 00:00:36,872
- What ho!
- What ho!

2
00:00:36,955 --> 00:00:40,209
Hey, Lazard, why do the night guys
get a piece like you...

3
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:42,628
...when we're stuck with old eel breath?

4
00:00:42,711 --> 00:00:45,047
It's fate, detective...

5
00:00:45,130 --> 00:00:48,217
...conspiring to keep us apart.

6
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,928
All right. I'm outta here.

7
00:00:53,305 --> 00:00:55,307
See ya.

8
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,476
See ya tomorrow.

9
00:01:19,498 --> 00:01:21,583
You all right?

10
00:01:22,334 --> 00:01:24,002
You lost?

11
00:01:29,091 --> 00:01:34,263
Anyway, I got her in the holding room,
but she's not talking, at least not to me.

12
00:01:34,346 --> 00:01:36,932
You're asking me
cos you know I'm good with kids?

13
00:01:37,015 --> 00:01:39,101
Yeah, a regular Mr Greenjeans.

14
00:01:45,482 --> 00:01:46,942
Hi.

15
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:49,111
This is Detective Barbala.

16
00:01:49,194 --> 00:01:51,863
He's gonna help you find your parents.

17
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:54,116
Hiya, sweetheart.

18
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:56,952
- What's your name?
- Michelle.

19
00:01:59,663 --> 00:02:02,457
Everything's gonna be all right, OK?

20
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:04,668
Don't be scared now.

21
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:11,508
Michelle what?

22
00:02:13,802 --> 00:02:17,306
You said your first name was Michelle.
What's your last name?

23
00:02:17,389 --> 00:02:18,724
Bishop.

24
00:02:18,974 --> 00:02:20,142
Bishop.

25
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:22,811
Michelle... Bishop.

26
00:02:22,894 --> 00:02:25,063
And where do you live, Michelle?

27
00:02:25,147 --> 00:02:27,232
Here in Buffalo?

28
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:36,325
What was that? Did you hear that?

29
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,170
Somebody call an ambulance!

30
00:03:56,071 --> 00:03:59,950
- How'd you hear about us?
- My brother. My brother's a cop.

31
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:01,493
Baltimore.

32
00:04:01,576 --> 00:04:03,995
He told me about your work
on the Tooms case.

33
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:07,499
He said you got a good feel
for things... out of the ordinary.

34
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:12,838
Look, the truth is Barbala never won
any popularity contests here at the 14.

35
00:04:13,505 --> 00:04:15,590
But he's still a cop, you know?

36
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:19,970
I guess that's why I can't just let this rest.

37
00:04:20,053 --> 00:04:24,558
You said there was one witness -
a little girl. What did she say happened?

38
00:04:24,683 --> 00:04:27,060
She said there was another man
in the room.

39
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:30,605
- It stands to reason somebody was...
- I was right outside.

40
00:04:30,689 --> 00:04:33,275
There was nobody else
except Barbala and the kid.

41
00:04:33,358 --> 00:04:38,196
- You didn't get a description of the man?
- I'm telling you, there was no one else.

42
00:04:39,197 --> 00:04:41,450
Listen.

43
00:04:41,533 --> 00:04:45,287
The department's treating this as a suicide,
but I knew this guy.

44
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,789
There's no way he did himself.

45
00:04:47,873 --> 00:04:51,626
Well, was he depressed
or under psychiatric care of any kind?

46
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,170
Nah.

47
00:04:53,253 --> 00:04:55,464
Only time he ever looked at himself
was in the mirror,

48
00:04:55,547 --> 00:04:58,467
and he always liked what he saw.

49
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:06,933
Plus, jumpers tend to open windows
before they jump.

50
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:08,685
Where's the kid now?

51
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:11,897
She was released an hour ago.
Her mother picked her up.

52
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:15,066
You don't think the girl
had anything to do with it?

53
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,027
I don't know what to believe.

54
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:22,073
Eight years I've been on this force. I've
seen a lot of strange things, but this kid...

55
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:25,827
Something's just not right about her.

56
00:05:26,745 --> 00:05:28,622
Did he have long hair or short hair?

57
00:05:28,705 --> 00:05:29,915
Short.

58
00:05:33,585 --> 00:05:35,670
Like that?

59
00:05:36,463 --> 00:05:39,674
Was his hair dark like mine,
or lighter like yours?

60
00:05:39,758 --> 00:05:41,635
Like mine.

61
00:05:45,138 --> 00:05:49,142
- How about a beard or a moustache?
- Moustache.

62
00:05:49,935 --> 00:05:51,978
You got a funny one?

63
00:05:53,813 --> 00:05:55,941
Like this?

64
00:05:58,693 --> 00:06:00,153
Or this?

65
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:06,451
Whoa. What happened?

66
00:06:07,702 --> 00:06:09,371
Weird.

67
00:06:09,454 --> 00:06:11,540
I didn't even hit a key.

68
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:15,460
Must be a glitch in the new software.

69
00:06:16,836 --> 00:06:20,799
Michelle,
was his moustache like that?

70
00:06:24,302 --> 00:06:27,847
Do you have any idea how your daughter
might have gotten there?

71
00:06:27,973 --> 00:06:33,395
Buffalo's half an hour away by train,
and the station is a five-minute car ride.

72
00:06:34,688 --> 00:06:38,233
When I came home Mrs Dougherty
was locked in the wine cellar.

73
00:06:38,316 --> 00:06:40,402
I called the police immediately.

74
00:06:40,485 --> 00:06:43,530
- And Mrs Dougherty is?
- Michelle's nanny.

75
00:06:43,655 --> 00:06:48,827
Her latest that is. She's already gone
through four this year, and it's only April.

76
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:51,830
What seems to be the problem?

77
00:06:54,374 --> 00:06:56,501
Michelle is the problem.

78
00:07:00,255 --> 00:07:02,340
How do you mean?

79
00:07:02,424 --> 00:07:06,052
As hard as it is for a mother to admit...

80
00:07:07,012 --> 00:07:09,180
...Michelle is a disturbed child.

81
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:12,851
Oh, I know this sounds terrible to say...

82
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:16,104
...but the truth is that
sometimes she frightens me.

83
00:07:16,896 --> 00:07:19,024
Frightens you how?

84
00:07:20,859 --> 00:07:23,361
She's not like other girls, Agent Scully.

85
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:27,365
Tell me.

86
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:31,119
She just isn't.

87
00:07:31,745 --> 00:07:33,872
She doesn't have any friends.

88
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:36,708
She hardly ever smiles.

89
00:07:38,376 --> 00:07:41,212
It breaks my heart, but I can't comfort her.

90
00:07:43,632 --> 00:07:46,551
She says she sees things that I can't see.

91
00:07:46,635 --> 00:07:49,054
She hears people yelling in her head.

92
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:54,225
Last summer we had to cover our pool.

93
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:57,979
Jim was trying to teach her how to swim...

94
00:07:58,063 --> 00:08:02,817
...but every time Michelle would get close
to the water, she would start to scream.

95
00:08:02,901 --> 00:08:06,071
Scream like you've never heard
in all your life.

96
00:08:07,072 --> 00:08:09,115
Your husband, where is he now?

97
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:12,494
We're divorced.

98
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,505
- Mrs Bishop.
- Mm-hm?

99
00:08:23,588 --> 00:08:28,510
This is the man Michelle said she saw
at the police station. Do you recognise him?

100
00:08:28,593 --> 00:08:30,261
No, I'm sorry.

101
00:08:30,345 --> 00:08:34,307
She also mentioned a friend,
someone named Sheila.

102
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:37,102
- Do you know who that is?
- That would be Dr Braun.

103
00:08:37,185 --> 00:08:40,689
She's the developmental psychologist
at Brylin Hospital.

104
00:08:40,772 --> 00:08:43,108
Michelle sees her twice a week.

105
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:53,159
Look at that.

106
00:08:53,284 --> 00:08:55,870
Looks like a hawk. A falcon.

107
00:08:55,954 --> 00:08:58,039
It's beautiful.

108
00:08:58,123 --> 00:09:01,626
- It's called origami.
- Japanese paper folding.

109
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,295
Where did she learn how to do that?

110
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:06,464
I have no idea.

111
00:09:10,552 --> 00:09:13,888
- Harry, you'll put that face into the system?
- As we speak.

112
00:09:13,972 --> 00:09:16,141
Can you drive Scully into the city?

113
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:19,436
- Wait. We have an autopsy at seven.
- That's your department.

114
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:23,815
I'm gonna go to Brylin Hospital, see
if I can have a chat with Michelle's shrink.

115
00:09:24,649 --> 00:09:27,694
Oh, and check for burns or lesions
on Barbala's body.

116
00:09:28,862 --> 00:09:30,530
Why?

117
00:09:30,655 --> 00:09:35,410
Psychokinesis is usually
associated with an electrical charge.

118
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:39,998
Are you saying Michelle possesses the
ability to psychically project her own will?

119
00:09:40,081 --> 00:09:44,002
How else could a 60lb kid
throw a 200lb detective out the window?

120
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:52,510
<i>No, I don't recognise him.</i>

121
00:09:52,594 --> 00:09:54,846
I have no idea who this man is.

122
00:09:56,347 --> 00:09:59,559
- Could Michelle have fabricated him?
- Quite possibly.

123
00:09:59,684 --> 00:10:04,773
As with many dissociative disorders,
the intensity of the patient's emotions...

124
00:10:04,856 --> 00:10:08,193
...is often too much
for one personality to process.

125
00:10:08,276 --> 00:10:11,362
So, in defence,
part of the personality splits itself off.

126
00:10:11,446 --> 00:10:14,866
- As in schizophrenia?

127
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:17,744
I'm afraid Michelle's diagnosis
is not that simple.

128
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:22,749
You see, my primary challenge has been
to discover the source of her extreme rage.

129
00:10:22,874 --> 00:10:26,669
In most cases,
it's a traumatic event in the patient's past.

130
00:10:26,753 --> 00:10:29,047
And in Michelle's case?

131
00:10:32,717 --> 00:10:37,555
Occasionally I would leave Michelle alone
for part of our sessions...

132
00:10:39,224 --> 00:10:41,309
...with this doll.

133
00:10:41,976 --> 00:10:45,188
Each time a new doll, anatomically intact.

134
00:10:45,271 --> 00:10:50,026
And each time she dismembers
and disfigures it in exactly the same way.

135
00:10:50,109 --> 00:10:54,614
First I thought she was being abused,
but after some sessions with her parents...

136
00:10:54,739 --> 00:10:58,952
...I became convinced there was
something else behind Michelle's anxiety.

137
00:10:59,077 --> 00:11:03,540
Something much deeper,
much more elusive.

138
00:11:03,623 --> 00:11:06,668
- Any theories?
- Frankly, no.

139
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:08,962
I'm at a loss.

140
00:11:09,087 --> 00:11:12,382
Have you tried deep-progression hypnosis?

141
00:11:12,465 --> 00:11:16,928
I've found hypnosis
an unreliable approach at best.

142
00:11:17,011 --> 00:11:19,639
OK. So how have you
been treating Michelle?

143
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:24,018
The Thorazine has been effective
in regulating her more bizarre behaviour.

144
00:11:24,102 --> 00:11:26,271
I'm sure.

145
00:11:26,354 --> 00:11:31,609
Have you observed any unexplained
phenomena in Michelle's presence?

146
00:11:31,693 --> 00:11:33,820
Unexplained phenomena?

147
00:11:33,945 --> 00:11:38,533
Inordinate physical strength,
psychic ability, telekinesis?

148
00:11:39,784 --> 00:11:42,287
You're joking, of course.

149
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:51,296
I have a patient waiting, Agent Mulder.
If you'll excuse me.

150
00:11:52,672 --> 00:11:55,717
Note postmortem examination
is being conducted...

151
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,971
...eleven hours and 45 minutes
after subject was pronounced.

152
00:12:03,975 --> 00:12:08,187
Note... raised... lesion...

153
00:12:08,313 --> 00:12:12,025
...approximately seven centimetres
below sternum.

154
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:17,196
Deep necrosis
inconsistent with cause of death...

155
00:12:17,322 --> 00:12:19,574
...as pronounced by Dr Guilder.

156
00:12:20,825 --> 00:12:24,037
And suggest localised electrocution.

157
00:12:25,747 --> 00:12:29,918
But a further tissue analysis
will be necessary.

158
00:12:30,001 --> 00:12:32,086
Excuse me?

159
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,255
Could I talk to you for a second?

160
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:36,424
I just started the autopsy.

161
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:40,053
Yeah, um...
I don't think he's going anywhere.

162
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,683
Will you, uh, take a couple for scale, please?

163
00:12:47,560 --> 00:12:49,687
Thank you. Be right back.

164
00:12:53,566 --> 00:12:55,693
So what do you think?

165
00:12:57,236 --> 00:13:00,406
- Looks like a match.
- Yeah.

166
00:13:00,531 --> 00:13:02,992
Name's Charlie Morris.
Officer Charlie Morris.

167
00:13:03,076 --> 00:13:05,161
Used to work Narcotics out at the 27.

168
00:13:05,244 --> 00:13:09,123
- D'you know him?
- No. Before my time.

169
00:13:09,207 --> 00:13:12,168
Well, where is he now?
Has he been transferred?

170
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:14,337
You could say that.

171
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,423
Agent Scully,
this guy's been dead for nine years.

172
00:13:19,092 --> 00:13:21,469
Which means that little girl...

173
00:13:21,636 --> 00:13:23,721
...saw a ghost.

174
00:13:39,988 --> 00:13:42,073
This way, please.

175
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:46,411
Uh, just by the side of my desk.

176
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:53,960
He was killed in Chinatown, gangland style,
allegedly by the Triads...

177
00:13:54,085 --> 00:13:56,254
...although no arrests were ever made.

178
00:13:56,337 --> 00:13:59,382
If you're gonna tell me
Michelle saw a poltergeist...

179
00:13:59,465 --> 00:14:02,468
<i>You're</i> the one
that found the lesion on Barbala's body...

180
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:06,556
...that could have been caused by
a concentration of electrothermal energy.

181
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,142
"Could have been"
being the operative phrase.

182
00:14:09,267 --> 00:14:12,186
I won't know for sure
until the lab results are in...

183
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,855
Why's it so hard to believe,

184
00:14:13,938 --> 00:14:17,650
when all evidence suggests
extraordinary phenomena?

185
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:20,028
Because sometimes...

186
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:23,281
- What?
- ..Looking for extreme possibilities...

187
00:14:23,364 --> 00:14:27,827
...makes you blind to the probable
explanation right in front of you.

188
00:14:28,786 --> 00:14:32,373
This is the face that Michelle Bishop saw.

189
00:14:32,457 --> 00:14:35,460
She walked by here
and saw the face of Charlie Morris.

190
00:14:35,543 --> 00:14:39,047
Which means there were no ghosts
flying around the precinct.

191
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:41,883
D'you have the report
describing Morris's death?

192
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:45,386
Yeah. I have what's been declassified. Why?

193
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:50,308
- Does it describe how he was murdered?
- Yes, I told you. It was a signature hit.

194
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:52,643
Give me the grizzly details.

195
00:14:56,522 --> 00:15:00,902
"His arm was severed just below
the shoulder, presumably by a chain saw...

196
00:15:00,985 --> 00:15:03,321
...and his right eye was gouged out."

197
00:15:03,404 --> 00:15:07,075
This is what Michelle did to a dozen dolls
in her shrink's office.

198
00:15:07,158 --> 00:15:10,286
Hell of a coincidence, wouldn't you say?

199
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:13,331
I think we should find out
more about Charlie Morris.

200
00:15:13,414 --> 00:15:19,253
<i>I got the address of his partner on the force.</i>
<i>Hopefully he can tell us something.</i>

201
00:15:40,775 --> 00:15:43,069
Detective Fiore? We're with the FBI.

202
00:15:43,194 --> 00:15:45,029
Can we talk to you for a minute?

203
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:48,366
D'you know this man?

204
00:16:01,796 --> 00:16:05,383
Do you mind if we do this out here?
Uh, I don't wanna wake my wife.

205
00:16:05,466 --> 00:16:07,343
This won't take long.

206
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:11,139
Yeah, sure I know him.
That's Charlie... Charlie Morris.

207
00:16:11,222 --> 00:16:12,682
You two were partners.

208
00:16:12,765 --> 00:16:16,352
Yeah, we rode together
his first nine months out of the Academy.

209
00:16:16,435 --> 00:16:20,898
What can you tell us about the
circumstances surrounding his death?

210
00:16:30,074 --> 00:16:34,579
That matter is still under investigation,
and so I can't comment on it.

211
00:16:34,662 --> 00:16:39,333
Detective, we're under the direct authority
of Captain Gersham at the 14th Precinct.

212
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:43,337
14th Precinct? I never worked out of the 14.

213
00:16:43,421 --> 00:16:45,381
What's all this about?

214
00:16:45,464 --> 00:16:48,009
We believe the death of Detective Barbala...

215
00:16:48,092 --> 00:16:51,345
...can be linked to the death of
Officer Morris nine years ago.

216
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:55,641
Linked how? I thought this Barbala
flipped his wig and jumped out a window.

217
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:59,103
- Did you know the detective?
- By reputation.

218
00:16:59,187 --> 00:17:02,940
- What's this got to do with Charlie?
- That's why we need your help.

219
00:17:03,024 --> 00:17:05,985
The report said
Officer Morris was killed off duty.

220
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:09,655
That's right. Best we can figure,
it was some kind of payback.

221
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,992
- For what?
- Around that time Organised Crime...

222
00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:15,369
...was doing a major sweep in Chinatown.

223
00:17:15,453 --> 00:17:17,121
- The Triads?
- Yeah.

224
00:17:17,205 --> 00:17:19,916
Some heavy busts went down
against the Woo Shing Woo.

225
00:17:19,999 --> 00:17:22,919
Lot of smack never made it to the street.

226
00:17:23,002 --> 00:17:26,547
There were some pissed-off people
playing mahjong that week.

227
00:17:26,631 --> 00:17:30,176
So you think Charlie Morris was killed
as a warning to back off?

228
00:17:31,677 --> 00:17:34,555
I think they picked a cop, any cop...

229
00:17:34,639 --> 00:17:36,307
...and they whacked him.

230
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:40,186
- Who is it, Tony?
- Oh, it's nothing to worry about, honey.

231
00:17:40,311 --> 00:17:44,398
Just some people from the FBI
asking about a case I'm working.

232
00:17:44,482 --> 00:17:48,361
- Sir, would you mind...
- Hey, it's the weekend. You guys mind?

233
00:17:48,486 --> 00:17:52,114
You can get me at the squad
first thing Monday morning, OK?

234
00:17:52,198 --> 00:17:53,658
Good luck.

235
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,832
Is it me, or did we just get the brush-off?

236
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:04,669
- Did you notice her hands?
- What?

237
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:09,340
He says she was sleeping, but her hands
were dusted with baking flour.

238
00:18:15,263 --> 00:18:17,515
<i>It's not a big deal, all right?</i>

239
00:18:17,598 --> 00:18:21,769
Don't jerk yourself around, Tony.
You're acting like a little bug.

240
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:24,563
- They were FBI!
- So what?

241
00:18:26,357 --> 00:18:30,069
They start sniffing around too much,
they're gonna turn something up.

242
00:18:30,194 --> 00:18:34,699
Relax. They're just people like us
going through the motions.

243
00:18:34,782 --> 00:18:37,827
Yeah? Then how are they
connecting Charlie to Barbala?

244
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:40,871
And what do they know, huh?

245
00:18:40,955 --> 00:18:42,873
Nothing.

246
00:18:48,379 --> 00:18:51,299
Come on. We're going to Citibank right now.

247
00:18:51,382 --> 00:18:53,718
- For what?
- The safety box!

248
00:18:55,761 --> 00:19:00,599
And what shall we do, Tony? Huh? Make
a donation to the Little Sisters for the Poor?

249
00:19:00,725 --> 00:19:02,935
Dump it somewhere.

250
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:08,232
Tony, there's only two of us left now.
That's over a million each.

251
00:19:08,316 --> 00:19:10,401
Take it all! I don't care!

252
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:14,113
Do your dream on the beach in Costa Rica,
or wherever you wanna do it.

253
00:19:16,449 --> 00:19:19,035
You think I like this, huh?

254
00:19:19,118 --> 00:19:22,538
Selling disability insurance to morons?

255
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:26,167
"Well, sir, what if you should
break your neck on the shore...

256
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:28,419
...or lose your leg in a car crash?"

257
00:19:30,421 --> 00:19:32,840
You listen to me, Tony.

258
00:19:32,923 --> 00:19:37,136
We agreed to wait ten years
and that is exactly what we're gonna do.

259
00:19:37,261 --> 00:19:40,973
I listened to you once before
and look what happened.

260
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:45,102
Nobody! Not me, not Barbala,
wanted to see Charlie wind up like that.

261
00:19:45,186 --> 00:19:47,688
We just tried to scare some sense into him.

262
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:53,319
It was an accident.

263
00:19:53,444 --> 00:19:55,488
End of story.

264
00:19:56,614 --> 00:19:59,450
And you better pull yourself together, Tony.

265
00:20:14,298 --> 00:20:16,384
Excuse me, sir?

266
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,070
Hey! Wha...?

267
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,866
Hey! Hey, open the door!

268
00:21:21,949 --> 00:21:22,992
Hey!

269
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:25,453
Hey, open the door! Hey!

270
00:21:25,953 --> 00:21:28,456
Hey, open the door! Hey!

271
00:21:40,968 --> 00:21:43,220
Hey! Open the door!

272
00:21:45,222 --> 00:21:47,266
For God's sake, help me!

273
00:21:52,563 --> 00:21:54,565
Agh!

274
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:29,266
Hey.

275
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:32,937
Hey, get your hands off me,
all right.

276
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,982
A patrol unit picked her up
a few blocks away from the bus stop.

277
00:22:37,107 --> 00:22:38,734
What's going on?

278
00:22:41,153 --> 00:22:43,239
We don't know.

279
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:47,618
All we know is that your daughter has
witnessed two deaths in the past two days.

280
00:22:47,701 --> 00:22:52,206
She's only eight years old.
She couldn't possibly have done anything.

281
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:56,085
Mrs Bishop,
no one is accusing Michelle of anything.

282
00:22:56,168 --> 00:22:58,295
She's just a little girl.

283
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:03,384
Is there anything you have not told us?

284
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:05,970
Is there anything at all you can think of...

285
00:23:06,053 --> 00:23:09,348
...that might shed some light
on what happened tonight?

286
00:23:09,473 --> 00:23:11,392
No.

287
00:23:13,644 --> 00:23:17,565
Well, this police station
has a designated room at the Sheraton.

288
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:20,818
An officer will take
you and Michelle over there.

289
00:23:21,902 --> 00:23:25,030
Why is this happening to us? Why?

290
00:23:29,743 --> 00:23:31,829
Can I talk to you for a minute?

291
00:23:33,664 --> 00:23:35,708
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

292
00:23:40,671 --> 00:23:44,758
Listen to this. You know that guy
that bought it tonight? Leon Felder?

293
00:23:44,842 --> 00:23:49,263
Before he started peddling life insurance,
he was a cop out of the 14.

294
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:51,515
Guess who his partner used to be?

295
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,684
Rudy Barbala.

296
00:23:55,853 --> 00:23:57,938
Four cops.

297
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:01,025
Three of whom are now dead.

298
00:24:02,026 --> 00:24:06,697
Their only connection being a drug bust
in Chinatown almost nine years ago.

299
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:09,325
And a little girl from Orchard Park.

300
00:24:10,659 --> 00:24:15,039
Morris, Fiore, Barbala and Felder.

301
00:24:15,122 --> 00:24:18,500
What's wrong with this picture?

302
00:24:19,877 --> 00:24:23,631
Well, for one thing, Fiore said
he only knew Barbala by reputation.

303
00:24:23,714 --> 00:24:26,717
Right. So why would he say that?

304
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:28,469
I don't know.

305
00:24:28,552 --> 00:24:30,304
No...

306
00:24:30,387 --> 00:24:32,473
Oh...

307
00:24:33,974 --> 00:24:36,060
What?

308
00:24:36,477 --> 00:24:39,730
There's a page gone
from Morris's homicide file.

309
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:43,233
- Where could it be?
- Is there a log sheet?

310
00:24:43,317 --> 00:24:45,402
Should be.

311
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:47,738
Yeah.

312
00:24:49,239 --> 00:24:52,409
Tony Fiore... Checked out this afternoon.

313
00:25:01,043 --> 00:25:04,755
Mrs Fiore, we're sorry for the early hour,
but is your husband home?

314
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:08,509
No, he's not.
He never came home last night.

315
00:25:08,592 --> 00:25:10,719
May we come in?

316
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:33,617
Scully.

317
00:25:40,624 --> 00:25:42,543
Look familiar?

318
00:25:44,795 --> 00:25:47,297
He said he was working a double shift...

319
00:25:47,381 --> 00:25:51,969
...but when I called the precinct,
he wasn't scheduled.

320
00:25:52,928 --> 00:25:55,222
It's just not like him not to call.

321
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:58,350
Does your husband
have family or friends in the area

322
00:25:58,434 --> 00:26:00,436
he might go to if he were in trouble?

323
00:26:05,149 --> 00:26:07,276
I've been on the phone all night.

324
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:10,821
Is he in any trouble?

325
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:14,074
Did you husband ever mention a detective
named Rudy Barbala?

326
00:26:14,158 --> 00:26:17,286
Or an ex-police officer named Leon Felder?

327
00:26:18,829 --> 00:26:20,748
I don't think so.

328
00:26:20,831 --> 00:26:25,169
Someone you might have had dinner with
once, a friend of Tony's from work...

329
00:26:25,252 --> 00:26:26,920
...a name you can't remember?

330
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:30,591
We don't normally socialise with other cops.

331
00:26:30,674 --> 00:26:34,094
Mrs Fiore, I couldn't help noticing
your origami collection.

332
00:26:34,178 --> 00:26:36,013
Did you do these yourself?

333
00:26:36,138 --> 00:26:38,515
Oh, no. Not me. No.

334
00:26:38,599 --> 00:26:40,684
That was Charlie's hobby.

335
00:26:40,768 --> 00:26:43,854
- Charlie?
- My first husband.

336
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:47,024
He was born in Japan.
His father was stationed there.

337
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:50,861
Not Charlie Morris, Tony's ex-partner.

338
00:26:50,944 --> 00:26:53,155
Yeah.

339
00:26:54,823 --> 00:26:58,118
I was waiting for him to come home, too,
nine years ago.

340
00:26:58,202 --> 00:27:00,287
Just like this.

341
00:27:01,955 --> 00:27:05,209
He was working on a whole set
from the painting.

342
00:27:05,292 --> 00:27:08,545
The only animal he never got to
was the giraffe.

343
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:10,964
See right there, behind the zebra?

344
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:15,302
Michelle is eight years old.

345
00:27:15,385 --> 00:27:19,473
That means she was conceived
at the same time Officer Morris was killed.

346
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:22,726
Do me a favour, Mulder,
and let me say it. Reincarnation.

347
00:27:22,851 --> 00:27:26,647
Metempsychosis, transmigration,
re-embodiment - call it what you will.

348
00:27:26,730 --> 00:27:28,482
All based on the coincidence

349
00:27:28,565 --> 00:27:31,819
that Michelle Bishop
and Officer Morris practised origami?

350
00:27:31,902 --> 00:27:34,071
What about the drawing, the dolls...

351
00:27:34,196 --> 00:27:38,075
...and that Michelle witnessed two deaths
that can be tied to Morris?

352
00:27:38,158 --> 00:27:41,495
So you think he's back like Peter Proud
to avenge his murder?

353
00:27:41,578 --> 00:27:46,667
It's not so far-fetched, Scully. Reincarnation
is a basic tenet of many major religions.

354
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:51,421
That still doesn't explain how an
eight-year-old girl can kill two grown men.

355
00:27:51,547 --> 00:27:55,926
Individuals with strong past-life memories
often exhibit psychic abilities.

356
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:59,096
- ESP, telekinesis.
- So where does that leave us?

357
00:27:59,221 --> 00:28:03,559
One short step away from proving
the pre-existence of the human soul.

358
00:28:04,309 --> 00:28:08,021
<i>On the count of five,</i>
<i>tell me where you are now.</i>

359
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:12,943
<i>One... two... three... four... five.</i>

360
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:18,323
- Do you know where you are?
- Yes.

361
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:20,492
Where?

362
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:23,412
- Tell me where you are.
- At home.

363
00:28:23,495 --> 00:28:25,706
What time of day is it?

364
00:28:25,789 --> 00:28:27,624
Night-time.

365
00:28:27,749 --> 00:28:30,294
<i>How old are you now?</i>

366
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:32,087
<i>24.</i>

367
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:37,175
No! We can't! We can't do this! It's wrong!

368
00:28:37,301 --> 00:28:40,804
- What's wrong? What can't you do?

369
00:28:42,139 --> 00:28:46,143
- It's all right. You can trust me.
<i>- </i> No, I can't! I can't!

370
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:48,896
<i>I can't! I can't!</i>

371
00:28:48,979 --> 00:28:52,441
- This is dangerous.
- Dr Spitz has conducted many sessions...

372
00:28:52,524 --> 00:28:56,236
If this continues, it could push Michelle
deeper into withdrawal.

373
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:59,156
Is it more dangerous
than pumping her with Thorazine?

374
00:28:59,281 --> 00:29:01,909
They're killing me! They're killing me!

375
00:29:01,992 --> 00:29:03,952
- That's enough!
- Mrs Bishop...

376
00:29:04,036 --> 00:29:06,121
<i>No! No! No!</i>

377
00:29:06,204 --> 00:29:08,415
<i>It's OK. It's OK. It's OK.</i>

378
00:29:08,498 --> 00:29:10,584
<i>It's over. It's over!</i>

379
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:12,169
<i>It's over.</i>

380
00:29:18,383 --> 00:29:21,929
- They just left.
- We almost had it. We were right there.

381
00:29:22,012 --> 00:29:24,932
- I know.
- We'll have to try it again.

382
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:27,935
Mrs Bishop won't go for that.
Not in this lifetime.

383
00:29:28,018 --> 00:29:30,145
Then we have to change her mind.

384
00:29:30,896 --> 00:29:32,981
How? And to what end?

385
00:29:33,065 --> 00:29:36,485
I mean, what exactly
do you hope to discover by all this?

386
00:29:36,568 --> 00:29:40,614
The truth. What really happened
to Charlie Morris nine years ago.

387
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:43,533
We'll find the truth when we find Fiore.

388
00:29:43,659 --> 00:29:46,828
<i>If</i> we find Fiore. And if he's still alive.

389
00:29:48,246 --> 00:29:50,916
Scully, you saw what happened in there.

390
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:55,253
What I saw
was some... traumatised little girl...

391
00:29:55,379 --> 00:29:59,299
...who, for no apparent reason,
has some connection to Charlie Morris.

392
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:02,219
All evidence suggests
Michelle <i>is</i> Charlie Morris.

393
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:04,972
- Mulder...
- Short of her growing a moustache...

394
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:09,935
...how much more apparent
does it have to become for you to accept it?

395
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,687
OK.

396
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:14,439
Let's just say that by some small miracle

397
00:30:14,523 --> 00:30:16,692
you managed to convince
Michelle's mother...

398
00:30:16,775 --> 00:30:20,570
...and the next hypnoregression
provides you with all you could hope for.

399
00:30:20,696 --> 00:30:24,574
No grand jury is gonna listen
to that kind of testimony.

400
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:28,412
We still will not have an actionable case.

401
00:30:38,255 --> 00:30:41,883
<i>On the count of five,</i>
<i>tell me where you are now...</i>

402
00:30:41,967 --> 00:30:45,804
<i>The inconclusive results</i>
<i>of Michelle's regression...</i>

403
00:30:45,929 --> 00:30:50,350
<i>.. do not shake my basic belief in hypnosis</i>
<i>as a tool for psychological healing.</i>

404
00:30:50,434 --> 00:30:55,814
<i>Whether or not it offers us definitive proof</i>
<i>of previous lifetimes is another matter.</i>

405
00:30:55,939 --> 00:30:58,483
<i>However, in this particular case...</i>

406
00:30:58,608 --> 00:31:02,529
<i>..all other explanations</i>
<i>seem to be even more wanting.</i>

407
00:31:02,612 --> 00:31:05,240
<i>- How old are you?</i>
<i>- 24.</i>

408
00:31:05,323 --> 00:31:08,827
<i>No, we can't! We can't do this! It's wrong!</i>

409
00:31:08,952 --> 00:31:10,996
<i>What's wrong? What can't you do?</i>

410
00:31:15,417 --> 00:31:18,670
<i>- And how old are you?</i>
<i>- 24.</i>

411
00:31:19,087 --> 00:31:20,130
<i>No, we ca...!</i>

412
00:31:24,092 --> 00:31:26,303
<i>24.</i>

413
00:31:37,314 --> 00:31:40,734
No, no, I... I wanna be here...

414
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:43,070
...in case he shows up.

415
00:31:43,153 --> 00:31:45,489
Yeah, thanks again. I'll, uh...

416
00:31:45,614 --> 00:31:48,241
I'll call you the minute I hear anything.

417
00:31:48,325 --> 00:31:50,452
OK, yeah. OK. Bye-bye.

418
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:14,518
Tony!

419
00:32:20,023 --> 00:32:22,150
Tony!

420
00:32:23,693 --> 00:32:25,654
Tony?

421
00:32:58,061 --> 00:33:01,064
I checked the wind-up profiles.
They're up to speed.

422
00:33:01,189 --> 00:33:02,816
Which means?

423
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:07,320
Whatever this image is,
it was recorded in that room with the girl.

424
00:33:07,404 --> 00:33:09,072
How is that possible?

425
00:33:09,197 --> 00:33:13,034
There was a documented case in the '70s
of a man from Porlock, Ohio...

426
00:33:13,118 --> 00:33:15,620
...who could influence undeveloped film.

427
00:33:15,745 --> 00:33:19,207
He could create shapes on the negative
from his mind.

428
00:33:19,875 --> 00:33:22,294
I don't know how much noise I can clean up.

429
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:24,921
Depends on the strength
of the latent image.

430
00:33:26,756 --> 00:33:29,843
I tracked him down.

431
00:33:29,926 --> 00:33:32,012
He's retired in Palm Beach.

432
00:33:32,095 --> 00:33:36,349
You were right, Agent Scully.
He backed up all his records on disc.

433
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:38,602
Pathologists are paranoid by nature.

434
00:33:38,727 --> 00:33:41,771
He faxed me the missing page
from the autopsy report.

435
00:33:41,897 --> 00:33:43,565
Great.

436
00:33:45,734 --> 00:33:49,821
Well, apparently, Charlie Morris
did not die as a result of his wounds.

437
00:33:49,946 --> 00:33:53,909
Says here there was a frothing of fluid
in the respiratory tract.

438
00:33:53,992 --> 00:33:56,203
That indicates death by drowning.

439
00:33:56,286 --> 00:34:00,916
So he was drowned first, then mutilated
to make it look like a signature execution?

440
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:04,169
Dr Yamaguchi said
there were no signs of submersion...

441
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:08,632
...such as goose skin or wrinkled flesh,
except for around the face and head.

442
00:34:08,757 --> 00:34:10,800
Mm-hm. That's right.

443
00:34:10,926 --> 00:34:16,264
Suggesting that he was killed
in either a bathtub or a toilet. Except...

444
00:34:16,348 --> 00:34:18,016
Except for what?

445
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:23,772
The marked bradycardia.
It indicates a raised plasma sodium level.

446
00:34:25,148 --> 00:34:27,442
He was killed in sea water.

447
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:49,381
Anita!

448
00:34:51,466 --> 00:34:54,177
- Anita!

449
00:34:56,680 --> 00:34:58,098
Tony! Tony!

450
00:34:58,181 --> 00:35:01,685
What's going on? Where have you been?
I know something's going on.

451
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,895
I need you to listen to me right now.

452
00:35:04,020 --> 00:35:06,731
I need you to go upstairs and pack a bag.

453
00:35:06,856 --> 00:35:09,359
Why? What kind of trouble are you in?

454
00:35:09,484 --> 00:35:11,736
I think someone's trying to kill me.

455
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:14,364
- Who?
- I don't know.

456
00:35:14,489 --> 00:35:16,700
Why would anybody want to kill you?

457
00:35:18,743 --> 00:35:20,161
Tell me what's going on.

458
00:35:20,245 --> 00:35:23,164
Will you please just do what I'm asking you!

459
00:35:24,207 --> 00:35:25,875
Please.

460
00:35:26,001 --> 00:35:30,380
I'm your husband and I love you,
and I need you to trust me on this, OK?

461
00:35:52,068 --> 00:35:54,112
Almost there.

462
00:35:59,743 --> 00:36:03,496
What I've done is to map
the frequencies of the interference.

463
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:07,459
Coefficients for sine on this monitor.
Cosine on that one.

464
00:36:07,584 --> 00:36:12,213
Now, using an algorithm program,
I can remove the frequencies...

465
00:36:13,214 --> 00:36:14,424
...like this.

466
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:17,218
Presto.

467
00:36:18,803 --> 00:36:20,472
What the hell...?

468
00:36:27,103 --> 00:36:29,147
Mulder, what is it?

469
00:36:29,272 --> 00:36:33,777
- You said salt water, right?
- Right. So?

470
00:36:33,902 --> 00:36:37,697
So Charlie Morris was drowned
in his own tropical fish tank.

471
00:36:37,781 --> 00:36:39,991
That's what he last saw before he died.

472
00:36:40,116 --> 00:36:43,620
We better hope
Michelle Bishop is at home tucked in bed.

473
00:36:50,794 --> 00:36:52,629
Tony.

474
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:57,675
Tony, somebody... somebody left this
on our doorstep tonight.

475
00:36:58,968 --> 00:37:01,012
Do you know who?

476
00:37:03,807 --> 00:37:05,683
Answer me, Tony!

477
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:18,446
You stay here and keep the door closed.

478
00:38:10,206 --> 00:38:13,501
- Agh!
<i>- </i> Tony, are you all right?

479
00:38:18,173 --> 00:38:20,216
Tony, answer me!

480
00:38:56,753 --> 00:38:59,088
Tony!

481
00:38:59,964 --> 00:39:03,760
Tony, please, who's there?
What's happening?

482
00:39:06,429 --> 00:39:08,097
- Agh.
- Tony!

483
00:39:11,768 --> 00:39:13,436
Let me out of here!

484
00:39:20,276 --> 00:39:22,779
<i>- </i> Mulder!

485
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:46,427
They said they were just gonna talk to you.

486
00:39:46,511 --> 00:39:49,305
Talk some sense into you.

487
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:52,141
What was I supposed to do, huh?

488
00:39:54,477 --> 00:39:56,896
All you had to do was take the money, man!

489
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:59,649
Why didn't you just take the money?

490
00:40:07,782 --> 00:40:10,910
Agh! Ah... ah...

491
00:40:10,994 --> 00:40:12,787
Tony, get me out!

492
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:14,372
Agh!

493
00:40:20,211 --> 00:40:22,505
What's going on? Let me out!

494
00:40:22,630 --> 00:40:26,384
- Go check upstairs.
- Please open the door. I'm scared!

495
00:40:34,684 --> 00:40:36,561
Michelle!

496
00:40:37,353 --> 00:40:39,689
This won't make right what happened.

497
00:40:42,734 --> 00:40:45,153
Please, I can't get out! Who's there?

498
00:40:45,236 --> 00:40:47,196
I can't get out! Please!

499
00:41:00,168 --> 00:41:02,086
Tony!

500
00:41:04,339 --> 00:41:06,382
Tony!

501
00:41:11,095 --> 00:41:12,847
Tony...

502
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:15,516
I'm sorry.

503
00:41:17,727 --> 00:41:19,771
I knew what they did to Charlie.

504
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:26,569
I was a part of it and I never said anything.

505
00:41:29,072 --> 00:41:30,740
I couldn't.

506
00:41:30,865 --> 00:41:32,533
Oh, no...

507
00:41:34,410 --> 00:41:36,245
No.

508
00:41:36,371 --> 00:41:38,414
I just wanted to take care of you.

509
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:42,960
Who else would've taken care of you?

510
00:41:59,769 --> 00:42:02,105
Oh, God...

511
00:42:05,775 --> 00:42:08,319
No... No more...

512
00:42:12,907 --> 00:42:15,410
