00:00:23,984 --> 00:00:27,779
<i>The fact is he's experiencing

<i>it is effectively destroying his brain.</i>

5
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:35,120
Enough. There's only so much

6
00:00:35,245 --> 00:00:38,582
- Sorry, I just...
- All you do is sedate him.

7

into a zombie.

00:00:52,512 --> 00:00:55,265

<i>(Cigarette-Smoking Man) Be better
than living like a zombie, wouldn't it?</i>

36
00:02:58,138 --> 00:03:01,058
I'm giving you a choice.

37
00:03:03,518 --> 00:03:06,313
- What choice?
- Life or death.

38
00:03:07,981 --> 00:03:13,528
Your account is squared - with me,
with God, with the IRS, with the FBI.

39
00:03:14,071 --> 00:03:19,242
- Rise out of your bed and come with me.
- I'm dying, you idiot.

40
00:03:19,326 --> 00:03:21,870
If I could get up, I'd kick your ass.

41
00:03:21,953 --> 00:03:24,498
Don't be so dramatic.

42
00:03:24,581 --> 00:03:29,628
Only part of you is dying.
The part that played the hero.

43
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:32,214
You've suffered enough.

44
00:03:32,672 --> 00:03:35,258
For the X-Files, for your partner,

45
00:03:35,342 --> 00:03:37,260
for the world.

46
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,429
You're not Christ.

47
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,141
You're not Prince Hamlet.

48
00:03:44,351 --> 00:03:46,478
You're not even Ralph Nader.

49
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:51,024
You can walk outta this hospital
and the world will forget you.

50
00:03:51,108 --> 00:03:52,567
Arise.

51
00:04:00,033 --> 00:04:02,953
What... what the hell are you doing to me?

52
00:04:03,036 --> 00:04:07,124
I'm showing you how
to take the road not taken.

53
00:04:07,207 --> 00:04:09,251
Take my hand.

54
00:04:11,837 --> 00:04:15,799
- Why should I take your hand?
- You can't read my mind?

55
00:04:16,716 --> 00:04:18,593
No.

56
00:04:18,718 --> 00:04:20,679
I can't.

57
00:04:21,555 --> 00:04:24,141
All the voices are gone.

58
00:04:24,224 --> 00:04:26,476
Take my hand, Fox.

59
00:04:28,395 --> 00:04:31,314
You have to take the first step.

60
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:36,653
<i>(Cigarette-Smoking Man) Take my hand.</i>

61
00:04:40,282 --> 00:04:42,033
I'm your father.

62
00:05:44,804 --> 00:05:49,935
Sleep is a luxury, a self-indulgence
we have no time for. Nor does Agent Mulder.

63
00:05:50,018 --> 00:05:52,687
How did you get in here?

64
00:05:53,772 --> 00:05:58,068
Getting in is easy. It's what you do
once you're inside that's key.

65
00:05:58,151 --> 00:06:00,195
What's that supposed to mean?

66
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:04,616
You are the only one with access to Mulder.
I need you to use it wisely.

67
00:06:05,075 --> 00:06:09,829
Like you? Almost killing him by filling him
with phenytoin for a moment of lucidity?

68
00:06:09,955 --> 00:06:13,291
It's what Agent Mulder wanted.
He knows what's wrong.

69
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:17,337
What he wants now is to prove it.
It's why he asked for me, not you.

70
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:20,131
I don't believe that.

71
00:06:20,215 --> 00:06:24,636
Two years ago your partner was infected
with a virus he claimed was alien.

72
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:30,016
A virus reactivated in him by exposure
to a source of energy also alien.

73
00:06:30,684 --> 00:06:35,397
Agent Mulder is living proof
of what he tried so long to substantiate:

74
00:06:35,522 --> 00:06:37,566
the existence of alien life.

75
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:43,863
Well, whatever it is, it's killing him.
And we have to get it out of him.

76
00:06:46,241 --> 00:06:49,119
You destroy this and I'll destroy you.

77
00:06:49,202 --> 00:06:50,996
<i>(phone rings)</i>

78
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:06,803
<i>- Scully.
- (Skinner) You need to go to the hospital.</i>

79
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:10,640
- Why? What happened?
- Mulder's gone. He's disappeared.

80
00:07:12,809 --> 00:07:18,064
There were guards posted here. A man who's
gravely ill doesn'tjust get up and disappear.

81
00:07:18,148 --> 00:07:20,900
- I know, I know.
- How did this happen?

82
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:23,570
His mother checked him out.

83
00:07:23,653 --> 00:07:26,114
- His mother?
- That's what they're saying.

84
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:28,908
Has anybody spoken with her?

85
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:33,163
I'm leaving that to you. It's better
I not be involved any further in this case.

86
00:07:33,246 --> 00:07:38,043
Sir, this isn'tjust a case.
This is Agent Mulder we're speaking about.

87
00:07:38,126 --> 00:07:43,548
And I'm trying to help him
by staying out of this from now on.

88
00:07:43,632 --> 00:07:44,633
Sir.

89
00:07:47,427 --> 00:07:50,472
I'm in a compromised position.

90
00:07:50,597 --> 00:07:55,977
The less I know about Agent Mulder's
whereabouts, and yours, the better.

The</i> child <i>is father</i> to <i>the man.</i>

92

<i>(Cigarette-Smoking Man)</i>
You've <i>been asleep quite</i> a <i>while.</i>

93
00:08:22,045 --> 00:08:26,341
I expect it'll be some time before
your sleep patterns return to normal.

94
00:08:30,887 --> 00:08:33,723
Would you like an explanation?

95
00:08:33,848 --> 00:08:36,142
I'm not sure.

96
00:08:36,309 --> 00:08:40,897
While you were unconscious in the hospital
this afternoon, my doctors worked on you.

97
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,065
Why?

98
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:47,696
At some point I realised that...
if the Syndicate didn't kill you, the FBI would.

99
00:08:48,238 --> 00:08:53,410
If the FBI didn't kill you,
your own misguided heroism would.

100
00:08:53,493 --> 00:08:56,579
There's really no way out for you.

101
00:08:56,663 --> 00:09:01,334
There's no way for you to cheat death
except by disappearing.

102
00:09:02,335 --> 00:09:08,007
- A man can't just disappear.
- Well, we've made entire cultures disappear.

103
00:09:08,091 --> 00:09:12,721
Like me, now you'll...
you'll become a man without a name.

104
00:09:14,347 --> 00:09:20,687
But even while you miss your former identity,
you'll learn to love life's simpler pleasures.

105
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,856
That'll be kinda tough with these on.

106
00:09:23,022 --> 00:09:26,484
When you no longer want to run,
those'll come off.

107
00:09:26,568 --> 00:09:28,653
How do you feel?

108
00:09:28,737 --> 00:09:31,156
I feel better than I did.

109
00:09:34,367 --> 00:09:36,661
I gotta tell Scully. I gotta tell her.

110
00:09:36,745 --> 00:09:41,040
If you do have contact with her,
you'll put her in danger.

111
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:47,756
You're entering a kind of witness-protection
programme, for want of a better term.

112
00:09:56,931 --> 00:10:00,018
Can I offer you a cigarette?

113
00:10:00,101 --> 00:10:02,353
I don't smoke.

114
00:10:02,437 --> 00:10:04,898
Maybe now you do.

121
00:11:02,038 --> 00:11:05,959
- How did you get here?
- I'm sorry to surprise you.

122
00:11:06,084 --> 00:11:08,753
Surprise?

123
00:11:08,837 --> 00:11:11,339
That you're standing here...

124
00:11:11,464 --> 00:11:16,261
Last time I saw you was in New Mexico.
They'd taken you from the hospital.

125
00:11:16,344 --> 00:11:21,015
- Your doctors feared the worst.
- I was hoping to see your partner.

126
00:11:21,099 --> 00:11:22,809
He's missing.

127
00:11:22,934 --> 00:11:25,395
You must save him.

128
00:11:25,478 --> 00:11:29,274
- He's very ill.
- Find him before something happens.

129
00:11:29,357 --> 00:11:34,028
Not only for his sake - for the sake of us all.

130
00:11:49,544 --> 00:11:52,255
- Where are we?
- Home.

131
00:11:55,008 --> 00:11:57,343
This is your new life.

132
00:12:01,139 --> 00:12:03,516
I don't understand...

133
00:12:10,023 --> 00:12:12,775
You can drive away right now.

134
00:12:12,859 --> 00:12:17,196
Drive back to Scully
and your X-Files and imminent death.

135
00:12:17,989 --> 00:12:22,452
I wouldn't be surprised if you did.
But I think you should take a look around.

136
00:12:22,535 --> 00:12:27,957
I mean, why leave something behind
until you know what it is you're leaving?

137
00:12:38,718 --> 00:12:43,556
Mulder was taken just before 2am.
His mother's signature's on the documents.

138
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:48,895
It's her handwriting. She checked him out
AMA - against medical advice.

139
00:12:50,355 --> 00:12:56,486
It's all legitimate until you go to surveillance.
This is the camera outside Mulder's room.

140
00:12:56,611 --> 00:12:59,072
Here's inside his room.

141
00:12:59,197 --> 00:13:01,866
And two other cameras on the ward.

142
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:08,247
We're guesstimating there were at least
three others involved. Check this out.

143
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:12,085
Where's Waldo?

144
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:20,385
- She's talkin' to someone.
- Yeah.

145
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:27,308
I know who that is.

Anybody home?

149
00:14:03,678 --> 00:14:06,347
They can change your name...

150
00:14:06,472 --> 00:14:09,767
but they can't change the things you love.

151
00:14:11,644 --> 00:14:13,938
It can't be.

152
00:14:14,981 --> 00:14:17,817
- <i>You're</i> dead.
<i>- (laughs) No.</i>

153
00:14:18,443 --> 00:14:20,611
No, just really relaxed.

154
00:14:21,487 --> 00:14:23,448
Scully...

155
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:25,700
saw you get shot...

156
00:14:25,825 --> 00:14:28,619
on the bridge six years ago.

157
00:14:28,703 --> 00:14:31,831
I was sure you were... dead.

158
00:14:35,501 --> 00:14:39,088
One, uh, well-placed bullet...

159
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:46,220
A punctuation mark in a man's life
and you get to start a whole new chapter.

160
00:14:47,013 --> 00:14:52,018
I'm fine, son.
Aside from a little tennis elbow.

161
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:05,948
I felt responsible for your death.

162
00:15:06,574 --> 00:15:09,368
You can let that go. Clearly I'm alive.

163
00:15:09,911 --> 00:15:12,121
I thought you died for my quest.

164
00:15:12,205 --> 00:15:16,542
Yes, along with Scully's sister
and the man you thought was your father,

165
00:15:16,626 --> 00:15:23,424
and Duane Barry and even Scully's
mysterious illness, and on and on and on.

166
00:15:23,508 --> 00:15:26,219
You can let go of all that guilt.

167
00:15:26,302 --> 00:15:32,308
I'm here to tell you that you're not the hub
of the universe, the cause of life and death.

168
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:39,440
We - you and I - are merely puppets
in a master plan. No more, no less.

169
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:46,322
You've suffered enough.
Now you should enjoy your life.

170
00:15:46,405 --> 00:15:48,866
Let me show you somethin'.

171
00:15:51,869 --> 00:15:54,956
That's my wife and daughters.

172
00:15:55,081 --> 00:15:57,667
We live just down the street.

173
00:15:57,750 --> 00:16:01,295
I hope... you visit us for dinner.

174
00:16:24,443 --> 00:16:28,281
Oh. Oh, hey, buddy, that's OK.

175
00:16:28,781 --> 00:16:33,119
You can build it again.
Just start again. OK?

176
00:16:40,459 --> 00:16:42,753
<i>(door opens)</i>

177
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:46,674
Who's there?

178
00:16:48,968 --> 00:16:52,388
- Who are you?
- Hundreds of little joys.

179
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:55,683
To open a door and have
a woman beckon you in.

180
00:16:55,766 --> 00:16:59,729
To have her make a fire
and lay the table for you.

181
00:16:59,812 --> 00:17:04,567
And when it's late,
to feel her take you into her arms.

182
00:17:37,934 --> 00:17:42,563
<i>This is Tina Mulder. I'm not in to take
your call. Please leave your message.</i>

183
00:17:42,647 --> 00:17:45,149
This is Dana Scully.

184
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:46,776
Thank you.

185
00:17:46,859 --> 00:17:51,113
As before, you can reach me
at your son's office at the FBI.

186
00:17:51,197 --> 00:17:53,407
Thank you.

187
00:18:52,008 --> 00:18:54,260
<i>(phone rings)</i>

188
00:18:54,343 --> 00:18:57,179
- Skinner.
- Sir, did you send me this book?

189
00:18:57,263 --> 00:18:59,223
- Excuse me?
- <i>This book.</i>

190
00:18:59,307 --> 00:19:05,521
It explains everything that I found in Africa,
using the same symbols I found on the ship.

191
00:19:05,604 --> 00:19:07,940
I asked you not to involve me in this.

192
00:19:08,024 --> 00:19:09,859
<i>It's all here, sir.</i>

193
00:19:09,942 --> 00:19:12,445
<i>A foretelling of mass extinction,</i>

194
00:19:12,528 --> 00:19:16,824
<i>a myth about a man who can save us from it.
That's why they took Mulder.</i>

195
00:19:17,533 --> 00:19:22,288
They think that his illness is a gift-
protection against the coming plague.

196
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:34,717
The assistant director has given me
express orders not to let you in.

197
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,635
<i>(groaning)</i>

198
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,684
Sir, are you hurt?

199
00:19:43,809 --> 00:19:45,895
Are you out?

200
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:48,105
Get on the phone.

201
00:19:51,359 --> 00:19:52,777
<i>(Scully) Hey!</i>

202
00:19:53,444 --> 00:19:55,821
Stop that man!

203
00:19:57,823 --> 00:20:00,159
<i>(alarm)</i>

204
00:20:30,689 --> 00:20:32,358
Morning.

205
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,114
- What's wrong, Fox?
- There's nothing wrong.

206
00:20:38,197 --> 00:20:40,366
Perfect.

207
00:20:40,449 --> 00:20:44,703
- It's perfect. What the hell am I doing here?
- You just need some coffee.

208
00:20:44,787 --> 00:20:51,627
No, I'm serious. I have commitments -
to the X-Files, to Scully, to my sister...

209
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:56,632
You think you know what that means?
Commitment? It's all just childish, Fox.

210
00:20:56,715 --> 00:21:00,428
- Childish?
- Yes. You've been a child.

211
00:21:00,553 --> 00:21:04,765
With only the responsibility of a child -
to your own dreams and fantasies.

212
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:10,896
You won't know the true joy of responsibility
until you plant your feet in the world...

213
00:21:12,690 --> 00:21:14,942
and become a father.

214
00:21:19,613 --> 00:21:21,240
Wow.

215
00:21:23,075 --> 00:21:26,871
Diana, you lay all this on me
after I sleep with you once,

216
00:21:26,954 --> 00:21:29,915
what's it gonna to be like tomorrow?

217
00:21:29,999 --> 00:21:34,128
- You have to let go, Fox.
- I'm just supposed to slip into domestic bliss

218
00:21:34,253 --> 00:21:40,593
even after I was brought here by a man
I believe left here to carry on his dirty work?

219
00:21:40,718 --> 00:21:43,971
He lives the next block over.

220
00:21:44,054 --> 00:21:46,891
We'll go visit after breakfast.

221
00:21:47,308 --> 00:21:49,226
<i>(knocking)</i>

222
00:21:55,024 --> 00:21:58,319
You told someone, didn't you?
You let the information out.

223
00:21:58,444 --> 00:22:01,864
- What are you talking about?
- A man attacked Skinner in his office.

224
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:05,618
- For what?
- For what he knows about Mulder.

225
00:22:07,703 --> 00:22:10,039
I haven't told anyone.

226
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:27,723
What is this? These are mine! You've hacked
into my files. What are you doing with these?

227
00:22:27,806 --> 00:22:29,892
- I was having them analysed.
- By whom?

228
00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:33,312
- The National Institutes of Health.
- What?

229
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:37,733
That material - encrypted data
that describes advanced human genetics -

230
00:22:37,816 --> 00:22:39,818
where did you get it?

231
00:22:39,944 --> 00:22:42,613
This was not supposed to go public.

232
00:22:42,696 --> 00:22:46,367
Wherever you got it, that data
supports what's happened to Mulder.

233
00:22:46,492 --> 00:22:50,204
It proves what he's become -
biologically alien.

234
00:22:52,623 --> 00:22:54,917
What are you hiding?

235
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:58,837
- It doesn't matter.
- It matters to someone.

236
00:22:58,921 --> 00:23:03,342
Whoever it is, it sounds like
they're looking for Mulder too.

237
00:23:08,681 --> 00:23:11,976
<i>(door opens and closes)</i>

238
00:23:16,981 --> 00:23:21,277
I wasn't expecting you so soon.
I thought you'd take a few days to settle in.

239
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:27,408
I think you need to allay his unhappiness
with things he perceives as left undone.

240
00:23:27,491 --> 00:23:30,953
Yeah, including why you live
in a bigger house than I do.

241
00:23:31,036 --> 00:23:35,040
I've got quite a few mouths
to feed - three grandkids.

242
00:23:35,874 --> 00:23:39,211
And, uh... your sister.

243
00:23:43,882 --> 00:23:48,470
She's been living here all along.
Living a life you'd forsaken.

244
00:24:00,232 --> 00:24:02,735
He said you were coming.

245
00:24:03,611 --> 00:24:08,657
A father has high hopes for his son, but he
never dreams he's gonna change the world.

246
00:24:08,741 --> 00:24:13,787
I'm so proud of this man -
the depth of his capacity for suffering.

247
00:24:13,871 --> 00:24:16,415
Like father, like son.

248
00:24:18,626 --> 00:24:23,589
They think what he has is killing him,
but, in actuality, he's never been more alive.

249
00:24:24,798 --> 00:24:28,594
- Do you think he dreams?
- Oh, I'm sure he dreams.

250
00:24:29,303 --> 00:24:31,305
About what, I wonder.

251
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:34,516
The dreams all men who are
owned by the world have.

252
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,104
A simpler life full of small pleasures.

253
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:45,402
Extraordinary men are always most tempted
by the most ordinary things.

254
00:24:45,486 --> 00:24:48,030
Dreams are all he has now.

255
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,593
- Bum a cigarette, Agent Fowley?
- I don't smoke.

256
00:25:09,677 --> 00:25:13,972
Really? I could swear
I smell cigarette smoke on you.

257
00:25:15,391 --> 00:25:18,519
- Let's cut the crap, shall we?
- Yes. Let's.

258
00:25:25,484 --> 00:25:28,821
- Where's Mulder?
- Before you blame everyone you can find

259
00:25:28,987 --> 00:25:33,701
for what's happened to Mulder, think about
what you could've done to prevent it.

260
00:25:33,826 --> 00:25:36,745
I just want you to think.

261
00:25:36,829 --> 00:25:39,790
Think of Mulder when you met him.

262
00:25:39,873 --> 00:25:42,876
Think of the promise
and the life in front of him.

263
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:45,713
Think of him now.

264
00:25:45,838 --> 00:25:50,175
And then try and stand there
in front of me, look me in the eye

265
00:25:50,300 --> 00:25:54,680
and tell me Mulder wouldn't
bust his ass trying to save you.

266
00:25:54,847 --> 00:25:57,433
I'm thinking, Agent Scully.

267
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:01,520
I'm always thinking.

268
00:26:07,359 --> 00:26:11,822
It's a chance none of us ever expected,
let alone hoped for.

269
00:26:11,905 --> 00:26:15,951
After all these years trying to develop
a compatible alien-human hybrid,

270
00:26:16,034 --> 00:26:17,911
to have one ready-made...

271
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:23,417
All these years... all the questioning
why... why keep Mulder alive,

272
00:26:23,542 --> 00:26:27,129
when it was so simple to remove
the threat that he posed?

273
00:26:27,212 --> 00:26:32,468
- You couldn't have predicted this.
- The fact remains, he's become our saviour.

274
00:26:32,551 --> 00:26:37,014
He's immune to the coming viral apocalypse.
He's the hero here.

275
00:26:37,097 --> 00:26:39,850
He may not survive the procedure.

276
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:44,563
Then he suffers a hero's fate.

277
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:58,786
Diana?

278
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:04,583
<i>(Fowley) Fox'?</i>

279
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:11,131
<i>- It's time, honey.
- (children laugh)</i>

280
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:17,262
<i>(FOWIQY) Hey, how you ddm"?</i>

281
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,543
Don't think of the man.

282
00:27:47,626 --> 00:27:52,589
Think of the sacrifice he's making
for all of us. For the world.

283
00:27:52,673 --> 00:27:56,009
It would've been nice to give him a choice.

284
00:27:57,344 --> 00:28:00,430
You don't think Mulder
would've chosen this?

285
00:28:00,514 --> 00:28:03,308
To become the thing he sought for so long?

286
00:28:03,433 --> 00:28:05,853
To feel what it's like?

287
00:28:06,937 --> 00:28:08,981
He is what he sought.

288
00:28:09,106 --> 00:28:14,236
- We'll never know.
- Besides, his task is almost complete.

289
00:28:14,319 --> 00:28:17,447
I'll carry the burden from hereon in.

290
00:28:30,252 --> 00:28:32,546
I know about the boy.

291
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:37,968
The boy on the beach.

292
00:28:38,051 --> 00:28:41,013
The vision you go to in your mind.

293
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:45,517
We all have such places...

294
00:28:45,642 --> 00:28:47,311
born of memory and desire.

295
00:28:48,186 --> 00:28:52,149
I've seen him thousands of times.

296
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:56,862
But I've never seen what he wants me to see.

297
00:28:56,945 --> 00:29:01,366
Close your eyes. He's ready
to show you, if you're ready to see.

298
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:20,427
Wow. What did you make?

299
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:23,597
An unidentified flying object.

300
00:29:23,722 --> 00:29:27,142
Hey, what are you doin'?
Why are you destroying your spaceship?

301
00:29:27,225 --> 00:29:30,479
It's your spaceship. You're destroying it.

302
00:29:30,562 --> 00:29:33,398
You were supposed to help me.

303
00:29:41,239 --> 00:29:43,408
You're running out of time.

304
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:47,329
Why do you come to me like this? Why?

305
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:51,166
- When I can't find him.
- You don't look in the right place.

306
00:29:51,249 --> 00:29:54,336
- You're not hearing me.
- You don't know where he is?

307
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:59,758
Even if I did, I wouldn't know how to save
him. This science makes no sense to me.

308
00:29:59,883 --> 00:30:03,220
Have you looked for him here?

309
00:30:07,224 --> 00:30:09,768
Are you asking me to pray?

310
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:23,448
There are more worlds than
the one you can hold in your hand.

311
00:30:32,624 --> 00:30:35,085
I hope you see the poetry in this, Diana.

312
00:30:35,168 --> 00:30:37,754
You're removing material
that may kill your son.

313
00:30:37,838 --> 00:30:41,800
We're forcing the next step
in evolution to save man.

314
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:44,928
We're doing God's work, Diana.

315
00:30:45,012 --> 00:30:50,350
Without this immunity, everyone would die.
This knowledge is God's blessing.

316
00:30:51,643 --> 00:30:54,521
I'll carry on for Mulder from here.

317
00:31:17,461 --> 00:31:19,755
The patient's come out. Mulder's awake.

318
00:31:19,838 --> 00:31:23,800
- He won't stay under.
- I don't think we can take him any further.

319
00:31:23,884 --> 00:31:26,762
- Is he feeling any pain?
- Flat on the monitor.

320
00:31:26,845 --> 00:31:31,850
- Any flatter, he'd be circling the drain.
- OK. Let's do this thing.

321
00:32:01,922 --> 00:32:04,466
<i>(Cigarette-Smoking Man) Rest now.</i>

322
00:32:08,011 --> 00:32:10,263
Can you open the blind?

323
00:32:11,848 --> 00:32:14,351
I'd like to take a look outside.

324
00:32:15,227 --> 00:32:17,479
I wanted you to have peace.

325
00:32:19,606 --> 00:32:21,817
Where's Samantha?

326
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:24,736
Your sister died five years ago.

327
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:35,580
Where... What about Deep Throat?

328
00:32:36,456 --> 00:32:39,292
We've been over this. He's dead.

329
00:32:41,586 --> 00:32:43,630
Diana's dead.

330
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,925
And Scully.

331
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:51,388
Scully's dead?

332
00:32:51,471 --> 00:32:53,557
She's dead.

333
00:32:56,852 --> 00:32:59,771
It's time for you to let go.

334
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:04,484
They're waiting for you... if you let go.

335
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:11,867
Close your eyes, Fox.

336
00:33:23,962 --> 00:33:27,507
We're the last, you and I.

337
00:33:28,049 --> 00:33:30,135
The end.

338
00:33:31,511 --> 00:33:33,805
And the beginning.

339
00:33:40,562 --> 00:33:43,023
There's nothing to be done.

340
00:33:43,940 --> 00:33:46,651
Nothing at all.

341
00:34:58,556 --> 00:35:00,141
<i>(footsteps)</i>

342
00:36:01,494 --> 00:36:03,371
<i>(Mulder) Scully.</i>

343
00:36:03,455 --> 00:36:05,457
I knew you'd come.

344
00:36:10,462 --> 00:36:12,881
They told me you were dead.

345
00:36:12,964 --> 00:36:15,633
And you believed them.

346
00:36:16,801 --> 00:36:19,637
- Traitor.
- What?

347
00:36:19,804 --> 00:36:22,474
Deserter. Coward.

348
00:36:22,557 --> 00:36:25,685
Scully, don't. I'm dying.

349
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:29,564
You're not supposed to die, Mulder. Not here.

350
00:36:31,066 --> 00:36:34,903
- What do you mean?
- Not in a bed with the devil outside.

351
00:36:34,986 --> 00:36:38,073
No, you don't understand.
He's taken care of me.

352
00:36:38,573 --> 00:36:42,952
No, Mulder, he's lulled you to sleep.

353
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:46,831
He's made you trade your true mission
for creature comforts.

354
00:36:46,915 --> 00:36:49,209
There was no mission.

355
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,880
- There were no aliens.
- No aliens.

356
00:36:54,005 --> 00:36:57,133
Have you looked outside, Mulder?

357
00:37:00,178 --> 00:37:02,222
I can't.

358
00:37:03,264 --> 00:37:06,101
I'm... too tired.

359
00:37:06,184 --> 00:37:10,271
No, Mulder, you must get up.

360
00:37:10,355 --> 00:37:13,358
You must get up and fight.

361
00:37:13,441 --> 00:37:15,527
Especially you.

362
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:18,113
This isn't your place.

363
00:37:18,196 --> 00:37:20,031
Get up, Mulder.

364
00:37:20,115 --> 00:37:22,992
Get up and fight the fight.

365
00:37:27,038 --> 00:37:28,873
Scully...

366
00:37:30,375 --> 00:37:32,502
Where's Scully?

367
00:37:35,088 --> 00:37:36,673
Scully.

368
00:37:40,468 --> 00:37:42,011
Scully!

369
00:37:59,737 --> 00:38:01,614
Mulder.

370
00:38:03,575 --> 00:38:06,828
Mulder, you've got to wake up.

371
00:38:06,911 --> 00:38:09,789
I've got to get you out of here.

372
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:14,377
- Mulder, can you understand me?
- (Mulder screams)

373
00:38:21,259 --> 00:38:23,720
Mulder, you've got to get up.

374
00:38:24,846 --> 00:38:29,684
I don't know how much time we have.
You've got to get up, Mulder.

375
00:38:29,767 --> 00:38:31,186
<i>(Mulder screams)</i>

376
00:38:31,269 --> 00:38:33,730
No one can do it but you, Mulder.

377
00:38:36,733 --> 00:38:38,443
Mulder, help me.

378
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:44,407
Please, Mulder.

379
00:38:57,545 --> 00:38:59,672
You...

380
00:38:59,797 --> 00:39:02,050
help... me.

381
00:39:13,311 --> 00:39:15,647
<i>(rhythmic knocking)</i>

382
00:39:17,023 --> 00:39:22,487
Scully, what are you doin' here? I was just
gettin' dressed to come see you, but I...

383
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:25,365
I couldn't find a tie to go with my victory cap.

384
00:39:25,448 --> 00:39:30,870
- No work. You have to go back to bed.
- Oh, wait. Tie goes to the runner.

385
00:39:32,997 --> 00:39:40,964
Scully, I, um... I was 00min' down to work
to tell you that Albert Hosteen is dead.

386
00:39:42,632 --> 00:39:44,717
He died last night in New Mexico.

387
00:39:44,842 --> 00:39:48,888
He'd been in a coma for two weeks.
He couldn't have been in your apartment.

388
00:39:49,013 --> 00:39:51,516
He was there. We prayed together.

389
00:39:54,185 --> 00:39:58,815
Mulder, I don't believe that.
I don't believe it. It's impossible.

390
00:39:58,898 --> 00:40:04,529
Is it any more impossible than what you saw
in Africa, or what you saw in me?

391
00:40:10,076 --> 00:40:12,870
I don't know what to believe any more.

392
00:40:15,248 --> 00:40:19,127
Mulder, I was so determined
to find a cure to save you

393
00:40:19,210 --> 00:40:22,505
that I could deny what it was that I saw.

394
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:26,509
And now I don't even know...
I don't know what the truth is,

395
00:40:26,593 --> 00:40:30,763
I don't know who to listen to,
I don't know who to trust.

396
00:40:36,436 --> 00:40:40,231
Diana Fowley was found
murdered this morning.

397
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:45,403
I never trusted her...

398
00:40:46,529 --> 00:40:50,074
but she helped save your life
just as much as I did.

399
00:40:53,578 --> 00:40:55,955
She gave me that book.

400
00:40:57,832 --> 00:41:00,918
It was her key that led me to you.

401
00:41:01,002 --> 00:41:03,087
I'm sorry.

402
00:41:04,213 --> 00:41:07,508
I'm so sorry. I know she was your friend.

403
00:41:13,431 --> 00:41:17,727
Scully, I was like you once.
I didn't know who to trust. Then I...

404
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:23,691
I chose another path... another life,
another fate, where I found my sister.

405
00:41:26,277 --> 00:41:30,865
And even though my world was
unrecognisable and upside down...

406
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:35,578
there was one thing that remained the same.

407
00:41:37,622 --> 00:41:40,792
You... were my friend,

408
00:41:40,917 --> 00:41:43,628
and you told me the truth.

409
00:41:45,963 --> 00:41:52,804
Even when the world was falling apart,
you were my constant, my touchstone.

410
00:41:55,390 --> 00:41:57,475
And you are mine.
