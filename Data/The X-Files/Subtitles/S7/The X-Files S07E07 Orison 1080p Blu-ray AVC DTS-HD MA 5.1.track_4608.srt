1
00:00:03,255 --> 00:00:07,301
God's love will set us free.

2
00:00:12,264 --> 00:00:14,766
And I believe...

3
00:00:17,686 --> 00:00:20,439
if I pray for that love...

4
00:00:23,066 --> 00:00:26,445
if I get down on my knees...

5
00:00:29,865 --> 00:00:34,161
and allow God to enter my hardened,
lonely, miserable heart

6
00:00:34,244 --> 00:00:37,873
and change me through and through...

7
00:00:37,956 --> 00:00:41,543
that miracle... will come.

8
00:00:42,669 --> 00:00:46,381
Now, who here believes that with me?

9
00:00:47,382 --> 00:00:49,468
Do you?

10
00:00:53,305 --> 00:00:55,599
- Do you?
- Yes, sir, I believe it.

11
00:01:03,065 --> 00:01:05,150
Do you?

12
00:01:07,402 --> 00:01:12,491
Well, believe... because God's love
is not just some slogan.

13
00:01:16,036 --> 00:01:22,000
It's a promise... straight to you
from the Lord Almighty himself.

14
00:01:22,125 --> 00:01:27,130
A promise paid for with the blood
of his only begotten son,

15
00:01:27,214 --> 00:01:31,260
Jesus Christ of Nazareth.

16
00:01:31,343 --> 00:01:34,846
All you have to do... is believe.

17
00:01:35,013 --> 00:01:36,181
(men) Amen!

18
00:01:36,265 --> 00:01:38,725
God's love will set you free.

19
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:44,856
Now, doesn't that just lift up your heart
and make you want to say "Glory! Amen!"?

20
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:46,942
Glory! Amen!

21
00:01:47,025 --> 00:01:50,112
Join with me.
Allow the spirit of Jesus Christ

22
00:01:50,195 --> 00:01:52,906
to show you the way
up to our heavenly Father.

23
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:54,866
Glory! Amen!

24
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,493
Glory! Amen!

25
00:01:56,576 --> 00:02:01,540
Let God's love free you from your prison
and deliver you to his side in Heaven.

26
00:02:01,623 --> 00:02:03,125
Glory! Amen!

27
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:05,335
Glory! Amen!

28
00:02:05,419 --> 00:02:11,133
Praise his name.
Praise his holy love. Glory! Amen!

29
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:13,051
Glory! Amen!

30
00:02:13,135 --> 00:02:16,847
- Glory! Amen!
- Glory! Amen!

31
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:20,183
- Glory! Amen!
- Glory! Amen!

32
00:02:20,267 --> 00:02:24,479
Glory. Amen. Glory. Amen.

33
00:02:24,563 --> 00:02:28,900
Glory. Amen. Glory. Amen.

34
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:35,574
Glory. Amen. Glory. Amen...

35
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:51,089
Do you believe that, Donnie?
God loves a sack of crap like you?

36
00:02:51,173 --> 00:02:52,591
The Bible says.

37
00:02:52,716 --> 00:02:58,096
The Bible says you kill women, cut their
pinkies, you get to burn in hell.

38
00:02:58,221 --> 00:03:01,016
- (guard) You listening to me?
- Glory. Amen.

39
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:04,561
God's got a place for you,
all right, you sick puke.

40
00:03:04,644 --> 00:03:06,855
Then where's that leave you?

41
00:03:07,773 --> 00:03:11,693
Sorry. It's not good enough
for the Illinois penal system.

42
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:16,448
(yells) My hands! My hands!

43
00:05:54,606 --> 00:05:59,069
Life without chance of parole for the
premeditated and sadistic sexual murders

44
00:05:59,152 --> 00:06:01,988
of five Twin Cities women in 1994.

45
00:06:02,113 --> 00:06:03,907
Donald Addie Pf aster.

46
00:06:06,743 --> 00:06:08,745
You two put this man away.

47
00:06:08,828 --> 00:06:12,666
Yeah. Someone forgot
to throw away the key.

48
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:16,002
That's another story.
We have to apprehend this man.

49
00:06:16,127 --> 00:06:19,381
We'd use your help in understanding
who it is we're after.

50
00:06:19,464 --> 00:06:22,050
Donnie Pf aster is a death fetishist.

51
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:24,678
A collector of bone and flesh,
toenails and hair.

52
00:06:24,803 --> 00:06:28,557
- It's what floats his boat, gets him off.
- He's a sick man.

53
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:33,478
We found women's fingers in his freezer.
He liked to eat them with peas and carrots.

54
00:06:33,562 --> 00:06:36,314
- So it's just women he's after?
- Just women.

55
00:06:36,481 --> 00:06:40,735
Five years in here thinking about that.
He's worked up quite an appetite.

56
00:06:40,819 --> 00:06:46,700
I happen to know you two agents
have a thing for the supernatural.

57
00:06:48,493 --> 00:06:50,495
The circumstances of the escape...

58
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:53,832
There is nothing supernatural
about this man.

59
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:57,669
Donnie Pf aster is just plain evil.

60
00:07:12,767 --> 00:07:16,730
"Don't Look Any Further" by John Hiatt)

61
00:07:31,745 --> 00:07:34,873
(Mulder) Case closed.

62
00:07:35,498 --> 00:07:37,626
You didn't look at the file, did you?

63
00:07:38,627 --> 00:07:44,382
- A man escaped from prison.
- Not a man. Donnie Pf aster.

64
00:07:44,466 --> 00:07:48,845
He didn't just escape. He walked out
of a maximum-security facility

65
00:07:48,928 --> 00:07:50,639
and no one seems to know how.

66
00:07:50,722 --> 00:07:53,642
- Isn't that why we're here?
- That's why I'm here.

67
00:07:55,393 --> 00:07:58,063
I don't know about you.

68
00:07:58,146 --> 00:08:00,732
Why are you here?

69
00:08:01,608 --> 00:08:04,903
- Go home, Scully.
- Mulder, this case doesn't bother me.

70
00:08:04,986 --> 00:08:07,197
The man abducted you.

71
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,744
Donnie Pf aster did a number on your head
like I've never seen. It's OK to... walk away.

72
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:18,333
Mulder, that man does things to people that
no one should ever have to think about.

73
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:22,837
It's not a question of if I should stay.
I don't have a choice.

74
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:26,508
So let's get to work.

75
00:08:27,634 --> 00:08:30,512
Well, this isn't the first incident.

76
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:36,267
Two prisoners have escaped from facilities
in neighbouring states over the past year.

77
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:41,272
At 6.06 this morning
Donnie Pf aster made it three.

78
00:08:41,398 --> 00:08:43,525
6.06?

79
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:46,486
What's so supernatural about that?

80
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:51,241
Dozens of witnesses, guards and staff,
and no one seems to remember anything.

81
00:08:51,324 --> 00:08:53,284
They didn't know they were missing.

82
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:56,496
- Were they apprehended?
- They haven't been seen again.

83
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:03,628
I already told the warden everything
I know... everything I saw that day.

84
00:09:03,712 --> 00:09:08,049
Yes, but I'm still a little confused.
Maybe you could go over it again.

85
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:11,386
- I'm a Christian man.
- Then you'll tell me the truth.

86
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:17,934
Yeah. But I got no idea about
Donnie Pf aster... or how he broke out.

87
00:09:19,436 --> 00:09:23,565
You and Donnie were in the garment shop
at the time he disappeared.

88
00:09:23,648 --> 00:09:26,151
It wasn'tjust me. There was a lot of us.

89
00:09:26,234 --> 00:09:30,488
Yeah, but you had something happen.
You had an incident.

90
00:09:30,572 --> 00:09:32,949
Yeah. Something like that.

91
00:09:33,032 --> 00:09:36,327
You cried out to the guards
that you'd cut your hands.

92
00:09:37,162 --> 00:09:40,832
My fingers, man. I saw them all cut off.

93
00:09:40,915 --> 00:09:43,585
- Others saw them, too.
- I felt them cut off.

94
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:48,840
- How do you explain that?
- God works in mysterious ways, brother.

95
00:09:51,843 --> 00:09:55,180
Glory. Amen.

96
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,854
Glory. Amen.

97
00:10:03,897 --> 00:10:08,109
Glory. Amen.

98
00:10:12,447 --> 00:10:15,992
Posthypnotic suggestion.
Did you see him?

99
00:10:16,075 --> 00:10:18,995
Did I see him raise his foot?
Yes, I saw that.

100
00:10:19,078 --> 00:10:22,123
Programmed behaviour,
prompted by suggestion -

101
00:10:22,207 --> 00:10:27,670
a rhythmic motion of the hands, producing
an unconscious act in a conscious state.

102
00:10:27,754 --> 00:10:29,881
Doesn't work on you.

103
00:10:30,048 --> 00:10:32,717
- I know what hypnosis is.
- Group hypnosis.

104
00:10:32,801 --> 00:10:35,762
If you're suggesting
Donnie escaped from prison

105
00:10:35,887 --> 00:10:39,849
using a technique from a Vegas
lounge act, I'd think again.

106
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:42,977
Mesmer was able
to hypnotise entire audiences.

107
00:10:43,061 --> 00:10:45,897
So, how would Donnie
have acquired this ability?

108
00:10:46,022 --> 00:10:48,191
I'm not saying that it was Donnie.

109
00:10:48,274 --> 00:10:51,236
- Then who?
- Three inmates missing from three prisons.

110
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:55,949
One man has had possible contact with
each of those cons. The prison chaplain.

111
00:10:56,074 --> 00:10:59,202
- "Glory. Amen."
- ("Don't Look Any Further")

112
00:10:59,285 --> 00:11:01,371
Not God, the chaplain.

113
00:11:03,081 --> 00:11:05,416
Scully, what?

114
00:11:06,251 --> 00:11:08,837
That song, can you hear that?

115
00:11:21,099 --> 00:11:23,268
Barely.

116
00:11:26,813 --> 00:11:30,942
I haven't heard it since high school.
That's the second time in the last hour.

117
00:11:31,025 --> 00:11:34,904
I think if it was a make-out song,
it'd be ruined for ever now, huh?

118
00:12:22,577 --> 00:12:25,079
Looking for something to eat?

119
00:12:26,956 --> 00:12:31,169
- Me?
- How about today's special?

120
00:12:38,009 --> 00:12:40,261
- You aren't a narc, are ya?
- No.

121
00:12:40,345 --> 00:12:43,973
- You're looking at my hands.
- You need a buff and polish.

122
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,810
What are you? A freak?

123
00:12:49,646 --> 00:12:51,689
I... I just got out of prison.

124
00:12:51,773 --> 00:12:55,526
Hey, Missy. Leave the customers alone!

125
00:12:57,028 --> 00:12:58,529
I'll do it for free.

126
00:12:58,613 --> 00:13:02,033
You just got out of prison,
and you want to give me a manicure?

127
00:13:03,076 --> 00:13:05,411
I'll even do your cuticles.

128
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:09,499
(Reverend Orison) You receive
the Lord's grace and this is your thanks?

129
00:13:09,582 --> 00:13:10,750
What?

130
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:14,253
(Reverend Orison)
Who do you think got you out of prison?

131
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:20,551
I don't care. I'm busy right now.

132
00:13:21,219 --> 00:13:26,724
The grace of God got you out, and it's
the only thing that will keep you out.

133
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:30,812
- I thought you were kidding.
- He's chosen you, Donnie.

134
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:40,780
Later.

135
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:45,702
- You called them on me.
- No.

136
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:48,913
- Then do something.
- I have a car.

137
00:13:54,752 --> 00:13:58,756
- We aren't going to make it to the car.
- It's within his power.

138
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:05,680
Glory. Amen.

139
00:14:07,473 --> 00:14:09,225
Glory. Amen.

140
00:14:09,308 --> 00:14:11,144
(waitress screams)

141
00:15:17,168 --> 00:15:21,714
- Was he here?
- Well, um... we're trying to determine that.

142
00:15:21,798 --> 00:15:25,635
- Did you see him?
- Well, that's a good question.

143
00:15:25,718 --> 00:15:29,305
We thought we saw something,
but apparently we didn't.

144
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:33,184
We got a call about a possible
sighting of the suspect.

145
00:15:34,227 --> 00:15:37,855
- Well, something happened here, huh?
- A guy got hit by a car.

146
00:15:41,067 --> 00:15:45,071
Prison chaplain, it turns out.
A Reverend Orison.

147
00:15:45,196 --> 00:15:48,699
Paramedics took him to the hospital.
He's in bad shape.

148
00:15:48,783 --> 00:15:52,328
("Don't Look Any Further" by John Hiatt
over stereo)

149
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:57,291
Excuse me, uh, could
you turn that up, please?

150
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,252
Yeah.

151
00:16:19,147 --> 00:16:22,567
You're lucky to be alive, Reverend Orison.

152
00:16:22,775 --> 00:16:25,903
- Who are you?
- Special Agent Dana Scully.

153
00:16:28,156 --> 00:16:32,243
Believe in the Lord, Agent Scully.
He believes in you.

154
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:36,998
That's nice. My partner and I are more
concerned with several disappearances

155
00:16:37,081 --> 00:16:40,251
from maximum-security facilities
that involve you.

156
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:44,088
Don't be concerned. God has them.

157
00:16:44,463 --> 00:16:46,841
What do you mean?

158
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:48,676
Reverend?

159
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:52,722
- You're a believer, aren't you?
- This has nothing to do with me.

160
00:16:52,805 --> 00:16:58,394
It has everything to do with you.
You have faith... have had faith.

161
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:03,107
You hear him calling you,
but you're unsure what to do.

162
00:17:03,232 --> 00:17:05,401
It's not exactly a long shot, sir.

163
00:17:05,484 --> 00:17:10,364
You stand as you do now,
neither here nor there.

164
00:17:10,448 --> 00:17:14,994
Longing, but afraid. Waiting for a sign.

165
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:18,456
When the signs are everywhere.

166
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:21,959
What happened to the inmates, sir?

167
00:17:22,043 --> 00:17:24,962
Everything has a reason, Scout.

168
00:17:26,005 --> 00:17:28,466
Everything on God's earth.

169
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:32,970
Every moment of every day,
the Devil waits for but an instant.

170
00:17:34,222 --> 00:17:37,725
As it is, it has always been.

171
00:17:37,808 --> 00:17:42,313
The Devil's instant is our eternity.

172
00:17:48,152 --> 00:17:53,491
The good reverend. How do you do?
Or maybe I should say "How do you do it?"

173
00:17:53,574 --> 00:17:58,371
His is the word. I am but the
messenger who delivers it.

174
00:17:58,496 --> 00:18:01,749
Well, this delivery arrived a little late.

175
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:05,294
A little late and a little cold,
as a matter of fact.

176
00:18:05,378 --> 00:18:07,880
I thought you'd want to see it.

177
00:18:09,548 --> 00:18:12,677
- What is this?
- Blood of the Lamb, Reverend.

178
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:17,098
The handiwork of Mr Donnie Pf aster -
a young girl he picked up at the bus stop.

179
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:19,850
- Oh, Lord.
- Where is he, Reverend?

180
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:25,314
He took my car.

181
00:18:26,816 --> 00:18:31,279
- She wasn't supposed to die.
- No, Donnie was supposed to die.

182
00:18:31,362 --> 00:18:34,865
You were supposed to kill him.
That's why you freed him.

183
00:18:34,991 --> 00:18:37,201
God knows you're capable of it.

184
00:18:37,285 --> 00:18:40,288
Reverend Orison
is really Robert Gailen Orison,

185
00:18:40,371 --> 00:18:45,584
convicted in of first-degree murder.
Served 22 years in Soledad.

186
00:18:46,127 --> 00:18:51,173
God spoke to me.
He told me to look after Donnie.

187
00:18:51,257 --> 00:18:53,551
When God spoke to you, Reverend,

188
00:18:53,634 --> 00:18:57,221
did he happen to mention
where Donnie was headed?

189
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:05,604
- Where are you going, Mulder?
- To prove that man's a liar.

190
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,483
How do you prove that somebody
isn't being directed by God?

191
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:14,071
- You don't believe that it happens?
- God is a spectator. He reads box scores.

192
00:19:14,155 --> 00:19:19,076
- I don't believe that.
- You think God directs that man? To kill?

193
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:23,789
Donnie isn't dead. We don't know that
the other inmates who escaped are dead.

194
00:19:23,873 --> 00:19:29,253
So what? You think that God directs
him to... let the prisoners out to kill?

195
00:19:29,337 --> 00:19:32,965
No. But I believe that the reverend
believes what he's saying.

196
00:19:33,049 --> 00:19:37,178
- That it's God working through him.
- Well, plenty of nutbags do.

197
00:19:37,887 --> 00:19:40,598
Has he ever spoken to you?

198
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:45,603
- I'm trying not to take of fence.
- What did he say?

199
00:19:48,314 --> 00:19:52,234
Mulder, I have heard
that song three times now.

200
00:19:52,318 --> 00:19:55,154
That may not mean anything to you,
but it does to me.

201
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:58,032
- What does it mean?
- I never thought about it before.

202
00:19:58,115 --> 00:20:02,953
It never meant anything, until yesterday
when it made me remember something.

203
00:20:03,079 --> 00:20:04,872
What?

204
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:08,709
When I was 13, my father
was stationed in San Diego.

205
00:20:08,793 --> 00:20:11,879
I was listening to that song
when my mother came in

206
00:20:11,962 --> 00:20:15,383
and told me that my Sunday-school
teacher had been killed.

207
00:20:15,466 --> 00:20:16,467
Oh.

208
00:20:16,634 --> 00:20:19,720
He'd been murdered in his front yard.

209
00:20:19,804 --> 00:20:24,850
And that's the first time that I ever felt
that there was real evil in the world.

210
00:20:25,684 --> 00:20:29,814
Mulder, Reverend Orison
called me "Scout".

211
00:20:29,897 --> 00:20:33,067
The same name my Sunday-school
teacher called me.

212
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:35,903
Donnie Pf aster escaped
from prison at 6.06am.

213
00:20:35,986 --> 00:20:39,031
That's the same time that I
woke up yesterday morning

214
00:20:39,156 --> 00:20:41,659
when my power went out.

215
00:20:42,535 --> 00:20:46,372
So what do you think
that God is telling you?

216
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:53,295
All right. Come with me, Scout. I'll show
you how the reverend talks to God.

217
00:20:53,838 --> 00:20:57,508
(male voice) Police are involved in
a manhunt for a prisoner who escaped

218
00:20:57,633 --> 00:20:59,635
in Marion, Illinois.

219
00:20:59,718 --> 00:21:05,516
He was last seen driving a green
Chevrolet Impala with a black landau top.

220
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:09,019
He is described as six-feet tall,
medium build...

221
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:45,931
(Mulder) It's a cerebral oedema.

222
00:21:46,015 --> 00:21:48,392
A swelling of the brain.

223
00:21:48,476 --> 00:21:51,562
A trauma not uncommon
with this kind of accident.

224
00:21:51,645 --> 00:21:56,775
Except this isn't accidental. The cause,
as it was stated to me, is self-inflicted.

225
00:21:57,776 --> 00:22:02,323
There's a small hole in the skull
which allows oxygen into the brain cavity.

226
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:08,162
The reverend has three times the normal
blood volume pumping through his brain.

227
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:10,664
- And he did this himself?
- Yeah.

228
00:22:10,748 --> 00:22:13,584
He probably did it when
he first got into prison.

229
00:22:13,667 --> 00:22:17,630
- When he learned how to use its powers.
- Its powers?

230
00:22:17,755 --> 00:22:20,758
There's a theory that at this point
in human evolution

231
00:22:20,841 --> 00:22:24,428
our mental capabilities are limited
by inadequate blood supply.

232
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:28,849
Centuries ago, in the Peruvian Andes, holy
men used to remove parts of their skulls

233
00:22:28,933 --> 00:22:32,520
to increase blood volume.
Or drill small holes.

234
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:37,191
This hole in his head enables Reverend
Orison to help these prisoners escape?

235
00:22:37,274 --> 00:22:43,239
The practitioners of this found that
they could perform certain mental tricks.

236
00:22:43,322 --> 00:22:46,033
One of which they called
"stopping the world".

237
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:49,453
Nobody can do that. I don't care
how many holes they have.

238
00:22:49,578 --> 00:22:51,622
But maybe they can alter perception,

239
00:22:51,705 --> 00:22:55,584
creating a disparate reality
which they project through hypnosis.

240
00:22:55,668 --> 00:22:58,420
But, why? I mean, even if he could, why?

241
00:22:58,504 --> 00:23:02,591
Donnie is serving a life sentence,
without possibility of parole.

242
00:23:02,675 --> 00:23:05,177
That's the final judgment of society.

243
00:23:05,261 --> 00:23:09,515
But not in the eyes of God. Or in the eyes
of a man who thinks he's God's tool.

244
00:23:09,598 --> 00:23:14,645
Well, if Reverend Orison meant to kill
Donnie Pf aster, then why is he still alive?

245
00:23:14,728 --> 00:23:17,898
Maybe he unleashed something
he couldn't control.

246
00:23:17,982 --> 00:23:20,901
Maybe he thought he was
opening the door of perception,

247
00:23:21,026 --> 00:23:26,073
but then, unwittingly, he...
opened the gates of hell.

248
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:30,995
(beeping)

249
00:23:40,671 --> 00:23:43,757
- What?
- Glory. Amen.

250
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:45,843
Glory. Amen.

251
00:23:45,926 --> 00:23:47,011
(beeping slows)

252
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:49,597
Glory. Amen.

253
00:24:35,893 --> 00:24:38,562
(knock at door)

254
00:24:40,773 --> 00:24:43,400
- Are you Donald?
- Yes.

255
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:47,613
I'm from Tip Top Gentlemen's Service.

256
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:04,588
- This isn't your place, is it?
- No. Why?

257
00:25:04,672 --> 00:25:09,593
Cos I was coming up and got stopped by
the landlord, like it's any of his business.

258
00:25:09,677 --> 00:25:12,930
He told me some
Reverend Orison lives here.

259
00:25:13,013 --> 00:25:15,766
- Now, you ain't no preacher, are you?
- No.

260
00:25:15,891 --> 00:25:20,270
Good. They always like the weirdest things.

261
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:25,317
You know what I mean?

262
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:43,752
- You OK?
- Yes.

263
00:25:45,838 --> 00:25:48,632
Something you want to say?

264
00:25:51,385 --> 00:25:53,804
Love your hair.

265
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:18,328
What are you doin'?

266
00:26:18,454 --> 00:26:22,166
- Is your hair chemically treated?
- My hair?

267
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:27,504
- I don't know which product to use.
- No, you're not using no product.

268
00:26:27,588 --> 00:26:31,592
My hair's clean. If you're gonna
be weird about it, I ought to leave.

269
00:26:31,675 --> 00:26:33,177
I'm being a gentleman.

270
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:37,681
Well, be a gentleman and get me a towel.
I'm gonna get outta here.

271
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:04,625
It's a wig.

272
00:27:06,919 --> 00:27:09,838
They lied to me.

273
00:27:10,756 --> 00:27:13,425
You lied to me!

274
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:31,026
Where did he go?

275
00:27:31,109 --> 00:27:33,237
Marshal?

276
00:27:35,864 --> 00:27:38,492
- Marshal?
- What?

277
00:27:38,575 --> 00:27:42,329
The prisoner. The man you were guarding.
What happened to him?

278
00:27:42,412 --> 00:27:46,041
He's gone, Scully. So's the marshal's gun.

279
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:48,335
You didn't see him?

280
00:27:51,797 --> 00:27:53,924
Let's go, Scully.

281
00:28:01,515 --> 00:28:04,518
- What is it?
- What does this mean?

282
00:28:09,064 --> 00:28:11,817
- Did you tell him?
- No, I only told you.

283
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:15,863
He must have... overheard us
when we were talking in the hallway.

284
00:28:15,988 --> 00:28:18,824
- I didn't mention the name of the song.
- You did.

285
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:21,368
No, I'm sure I didn't, Mulder.

286
00:28:21,451 --> 00:28:25,873
Well... maybe this was meant for you.

287
00:28:25,956 --> 00:28:28,333
"Don't look any further."

288
00:28:45,142 --> 00:28:47,227
(cocks gun)

289
00:28:49,688 --> 00:28:53,275
"Whosoever sheddeth man's blood...

290
00:28:53,358 --> 00:28:57,362
by man shall his blood be shed."

291
00:28:59,156 --> 00:29:01,992
- What are you doing?
- Taking you home.

292
00:29:06,163 --> 00:29:09,374
The wicked... will be punished.

293
00:29:23,263 --> 00:29:26,433
Pray for God's love, Donnie.

294
00:29:29,811 --> 00:29:33,440
Find the humility in yourself
to allow God into your heart.

295
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:36,526
All you have to do is believe.

296
00:29:37,486 --> 00:29:42,658
Repent. You'll feel God's love come to show
you the way to his heavenly kingdom.

297
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:44,451
(whimpers)

298
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:51,458
- Are you sorry for what you've done?
- You... (mumbles)

299
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:55,504
- What did you say?
- Never... no... no...

300
00:29:59,049 --> 00:30:03,178
- Why are you crying?
- I can't... I can't... (mumbles)

301
00:30:03,261 --> 00:30:05,889
Beg his forgiveness for what you did.

302
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:09,977
For what you did to all
those poor, helpless girls.

303
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:14,189
My violence is always waiting...
for an instant.

304
00:30:14,272 --> 00:30:16,900
For when his back is turned.

305
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:20,112
You can see it now.

306
00:30:20,237 --> 00:30:24,491
Are you crying for your sins?
Or for yourself?

307
00:30:24,574 --> 00:30:28,996
No, Reverend. I cry for you...

308
00:30:29,871 --> 00:30:32,624
because you cannot kill me.

309
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:58,442
You know, it's funny, when
all is said and done, there's...

310
00:30:58,525 --> 00:31:01,486
not much mystery in murder.

311
00:31:01,611 --> 00:31:04,489
And for that I owe you an apology, Mulder.

312
00:31:04,573 --> 00:31:06,867
What do you mean?

313
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:11,872
Well, you were right. I was looking too hard
for connections that weren't there.

314
00:31:11,955 --> 00:31:15,042
Orison was a murderer, plain and simple.

315
00:31:15,125 --> 00:31:18,462
He liberated prisoners so he could
bring them here, pass judgment.

316
00:31:18,587 --> 00:31:22,883
I guess in his own twisted way
he was making good with his god.

317
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:26,845
"Glory. Amen." Let's go home, Scully.

318
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:31,433
You know, Donnie Pf aster placed the call
to the police that led us out here.

319
00:31:31,516 --> 00:31:33,977
It's like he's begging us to hunt him down.

320
00:31:34,102 --> 00:31:38,648
This X-file is over... lying dead there
in a grave he dug himself.

321
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:41,860
Let's let the US Marshals
take over from here.

322
00:31:44,362 --> 00:31:47,157
Don't look any further, Scully.

323
00:33:59,331 --> 00:34:00,665
(phone rings)

324
00:34:00,749 --> 00:34:03,668
- Fox Mulder. Leave a message after the...
- (beep)

325
00:34:03,793 --> 00:34:06,213
Agent Mulder,
Marshal Joe Daddo in Marion.

326
00:34:06,296 --> 00:34:09,633
Just talked to a call girl
who lD'd Donnie as an attacker.

327
00:34:09,758 --> 00:34:12,928
Claims Pf aster got upset
when she was wearing a red wig.

328
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:18,058
Upset she wasn't a redhead. This mean
anything to you? Appreciate a call back.

329
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:42,499
(yells)

330
00:35:28,628 --> 00:35:30,922
Go back to hell!

331
00:35:34,801 --> 00:35:37,971
- Who does your nails, girly girl?
- Let me go!

332
00:35:38,054 --> 00:35:41,474
The only reason you're alive
is because I asked the judge for life!

333
00:35:41,558 --> 00:35:45,186
The only reason is because
we didn't kill you when we could!

334
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:47,314
You're the one that got away.

335
00:35:49,274 --> 00:35:52,527
- You're all I think about.
- I'm a federal agent.

336
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:56,614
You do anything to me and they
will not give you a break this time.

337
00:35:56,698 --> 00:35:58,325
I'm going to run you a bath.

338
00:35:58,408 --> 00:35:59,534
(screams)

339
00:36:11,755 --> 00:36:13,506
("Don't Look Any Further")

340
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:15,717
(turns radio off)

341
00:36:16,968 --> 00:36:19,429
(turns radio on)

342
00:36:19,512 --> 00:36:23,016
("Don't Look Any Further" by John Hiatt)

343
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:46,289
Now be good, and don't
cause me any problems.

344
00:36:54,798 --> 00:36:56,925
(water running)

345
00:36:58,218 --> 00:37:01,304
(phone ringing)

346
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:07,894
(continues ringing)

347
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:17,946
("Don't Look Any Further"
by John Hiatt)

348
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:21,324
(ringing tone)

349
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:10,493
(turns stereo off)

350
00:40:48,448 --> 00:40:52,410
(mouthing) Put 'em up!

351
00:41:19,812 --> 00:41:22,148
(mouthing) Did he hurt you?

352
00:42:06,943 --> 00:42:08,986
(door opens)

353
00:42:12,407 --> 00:42:15,451
- Excuse me.
- (cop) Yeah. Sure.

354
00:42:26,295 --> 00:42:30,049
If you want to pack some things,
we can get out of here.

355
00:42:30,133 --> 00:42:32,218
Yeah.

356
00:42:39,934 --> 00:42:42,437
You can't judge yourself.

357
00:42:48,818 --> 00:42:52,864
- Maybe I don't have to.
- The Bible allows for vengeance.

358
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:55,992
But the law doesn't.

359
00:42:57,243 --> 00:43:00,705
The way I see it...
he didn't give you a choice.

360
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:08,004
And my report will reflect that...
in case you're worried.

361
00:43:08,129 --> 00:43:12,592
Donnie Pf aster would have surely
killed again if given the chance.

362
00:43:12,675 --> 00:43:14,969
He was evil, Mulder.

363
00:43:15,887 --> 00:43:20,767
I'm sure about that without a doubt.
But there's one thing that I'm not sure of.

364
00:43:22,185 --> 00:43:25,813
- What's that?
- Who was at work in me?

365
00:43:27,482 --> 00:43:30,443
Or what?

366
00:43:30,526 --> 00:43:34,155
What made me...

367
00:43:34,238 --> 00:43:37,033
What made me pull the trigger?

368
00:43:37,658 --> 00:43:40,286
You mean, if it was God?

369
00:43:40,369 --> 00:43:43,664
I mean... what if it wasn't?

370
00:44:28,626 --> 00:44:31,629

371
00:44:31,712 --> 00:44:33,256
(Child) I made this!
