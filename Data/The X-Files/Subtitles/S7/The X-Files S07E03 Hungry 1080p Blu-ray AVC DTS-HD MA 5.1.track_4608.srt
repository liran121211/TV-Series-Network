Hello?!

Hey! I'm sittin' here, dude!

Uh-uh. I was here before
you turned off the light.

7
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,713
Grandfather clause, man.

8
00:00:44,796 --> 00:00:50,344

- <i>The light was</i> a <i>mistake.</i> We're <i>closed.</i>

9
00:00:50,469 --> 00:00:52,763
- Sorry.
- The light was on!

10
00:00:53,639 --> 00:00:57,643
How bad do you want this job,
cos I'll call the head office right now?

11
00:00:57,768 --> 00:01:03,607
Super patty, double, with cheese.
Supersize fries, supersize Diet Sprite.

- Hey, yo, Derwood.
- Hey, Rob.

23
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:45,185
- Hey, Mr Rice.
- How's it goin', Rob?

24
00:03:46,978 --> 00:03:49,439
- Have a good one, Lucy.
- You too, Rob.

<i>(police siren)</i>

26
00:04:05,831 --> 00:04:08,792
Welcome to Lucky Boy.
May I take your order?

27
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:12,170
- We'll have it our way.
- FBI. Special Agents Scully and Mulder.

28
00:04:12,254 --> 00:04:16,675
- We'd like a word with your manager, please.
- That's me. How can I help you?

29
00:04:16,758 --> 00:04:19,928
Sir, would you do us a favour
and gather your employees?

30
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:22,681
- What's going on?
- We're investigating a murder.

31
00:04:22,806 --> 00:04:26,977
A car was found ten miles from here.
A body was found in the trunk of that car.

32
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:30,856
- What does that have to do with us?
- This was also found in the car.

33
00:04:30,981 --> 00:04:34,776
It's a badge that's only given
to employees, is that correct?

34
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:39,614
"Free fer Fridays". It's our promotion where
you buy one super patty and get one free.

35
00:04:39,698 --> 00:04:44,870
But look, there's four Lucky Boys in
Costa Mesa alone and 30 in Orange County.

36
00:04:44,953 --> 00:04:47,038
- 32.
- Long day, so let's make this quick.

37
00:04:47,122 --> 00:04:50,792
- Does everybody have their button?
- We only wear them on Fridays.

38
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:53,378
Free fer Fridays.

39
00:04:53,462 --> 00:04:57,048
Yeah, but does everybody have their button?

40
00:05:15,984 --> 00:05:19,237
Hey, uh, you, back there.
What's your name?

41
00:05:20,405 --> 00:05:24,576
- Derwood Spinks.
- Do you have your button, Derwood?

42
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:31,291
No. I must have left it at home on account of
we're supposed to only wear 'em on Fridays.

43
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:35,962
I sure as hell didn't leave it on no dead guy.

44
00:05:36,046 --> 00:05:38,632
I don't believe that we said
the victim was male.

45
00:05:40,884 --> 00:05:45,263
We're gonna ask everybody to step outside
while we take a quick look around.

46
00:05:45,388 --> 00:05:47,933
Who was the victim?

47
00:05:48,016 --> 00:05:51,144
His name was Donald Edward Pankow.

48
00:05:51,269 --> 00:05:53,939
- Does that ring a bell?
- No.

49
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:12,541
I'll get some cigarettes.

50
00:06:17,045 --> 00:06:22,259
I'd better call the corporate headquarters.
Find out what they want us to do.

51
00:06:28,098 --> 00:06:30,892
(Mulder) Hey, Scully, check it out.

52
00:06:30,976 --> 00:06:35,397
You know how they say you never wanna see
the kitchen of your favourite restaurants?

53
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:38,942
Somehow I don't think Lucky Boy
would make that list.

54
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:42,696
My point being that this is
a hell of a lot cleaner than all the others.

55
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:45,323
- Don't you think?
- I guess.

56
00:06:45,407 --> 00:06:49,828
So what are you saying? This place
has been scrubbed to cover up evidence?

57
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:53,999
<i>Maybe. Maybe I'm thinking
this was the crime scene.</i>

58
00:06:55,292 --> 00:07:01,089
<i>(Scully) So Mr Pankow had his brain neatly
removed from his skull here in this kitchen?</i>

59
00:07:01,172 --> 00:07:05,594
- Had to happen somewhere.
- But next to the shake machine, Mulder?

60
00:07:05,677 --> 00:07:07,762
I think we should check out lockers,

61
00:07:07,846 --> 00:07:11,600
not entertain the idea that
ad hoc surgery was performed here.

62
00:07:11,683 --> 00:07:15,020
I wouldn't exactly call it surgery.

63
00:07:15,228 --> 00:07:19,774
What if this man's brain was eaten?
It's not sociologically unheard of.

64
00:07:19,858 --> 00:07:23,069
There are tribes in New Guinea
that consider brains a delicacy.

65
00:07:23,194 --> 00:07:27,782
- Yeah, but, Mulder, we're in Orange County.
- Yeah, what's your point?

66
00:07:27,866 --> 00:07:33,455
It's just that nothing suggests a fetishistic
killing. The brain wasn't removed intact.

67
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:35,957
What if his brain was eaten out of his skull?

68
00:07:36,124 --> 00:07:39,878
Through a small opening that looks like
it was outwith a hole saw?

69
00:07:39,961 --> 00:07:42,464
<i>(Mulder) Maybe it was cut.
Maybe it was punched.</i>

70
00:07:42,547 --> 00:07:45,800
<i>What look like tool marks to you
look to me more organic.</i>

71
00:07:46,468 --> 00:07:52,057
Like it was made by a tongue or a proboscis.

72
00:07:53,224 --> 00:07:56,144
The proboscis of what?

73
00:07:57,062 --> 00:07:58,688
I don't know.

74
00:07:59,022 --> 00:08:01,858
<i>Oh! Hello. Look at this.</i>

75
00:08:03,193 --> 00:08:05,820
Does that look like blood to you?

76
00:08:06,237 --> 00:08:08,239
Yes, looks like it.

77
00:08:08,365 --> 00:08:12,327
What is that? Next to it. Is that, uh...?

78
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:15,914
Oh, my God. Is that...
is that brain matter? There?

79
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:19,584
No, I'd say that's ground beef.

80
00:08:19,918 --> 00:08:23,171
<i>- Ground beef?
- Yeah.</i>

81
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:04,587
<i>(knocking)</i>

82
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:15,515
Rob Roberts? It's Agent Mulder.

83
00:09:19,018 --> 00:09:22,063
- Hello again. Sorry to bother you at home.
- No, no bother.

84
00:09:22,147 --> 00:09:25,108
- Yeah, can I come in?
- Yeah... sure, sure.

85
00:09:26,109 --> 00:09:28,987
- What, uh, what can I do for you?
- Live here alone?

86
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:33,116
- Yeah, it's just me.
- Mom or girlfriend?

87
00:09:33,199 --> 00:09:36,244
- What?
- Come on, man, who cleans up after you?

88
00:09:36,327 --> 00:09:39,497
Neither. It's... just me. I live here alone.

89
00:09:39,706 --> 00:09:43,001
Bravo. They say single guys
are just bears who own furniture.

90
00:09:43,126 --> 00:09:45,879
But... I mean, my place?

91
00:09:45,962 --> 00:09:48,506
But here, you can smell the Pine-Sol.

92
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:51,342
Thanks. Can I... can I get you anything?

93
00:09:51,468 --> 00:09:55,013
Yeah, a cheeseburger
and a large order of fries.

94
00:09:57,056 --> 00:10:01,644
It's a bad joke. I'm sorry.
Um, Mr Rice, your manager,

95
00:10:01,728 --> 00:10:04,939
he told me that you stayed late on Friday.

96
00:10:05,023 --> 00:10:07,150
- Is that right?
- Yeah, sure, Friday.

97
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:11,780
The freezer had died on us. I stayed after
to throw out the meat that was goin' bad.

98
00:10:11,863 --> 00:10:14,365
Yeah, did you volunteer to close?

99
00:10:14,449 --> 00:10:17,702
- Yeah.
- Yeah, OK. You volunteered.

100
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:20,371
Volunteered.

101
00:10:21,581 --> 00:10:23,541
Um...

102
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:27,962
The 35 pounds of ground chuck
that Mr Rice told you to throw away,

103
00:10:28,046 --> 00:10:30,548
- what did you do with that?
- I threw it out.

104
00:10:30,632 --> 00:10:34,010
- Where?
- In the dumpster behind the restaurant.

105
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:37,222
Hm. That's weird.

106
00:10:37,305 --> 00:10:40,350
That's what I figured you did,
so I checked and it was empty.

107
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:43,102
It's weird. It only gets
cleaned out on Thursday,

108
00:10:43,228 --> 00:10:48,525
and you'd have thrown away the meat on
Friday, so you'd expect the meat to be there.

109
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:51,903
I don't see how that's relevant
to this murder case anyway.

110
00:10:51,986 --> 00:10:56,074
Let me see if there's anything else
I wanted to ask you.

111
00:10:56,574 --> 00:10:58,701
Blood.

112
00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:06,584
You're... you're bleeding.

113
00:11:07,961 --> 00:11:10,171
I bit my lip.

114
00:11:11,297 --> 00:11:14,676
I think that just about wraps it up for me here.

115
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:17,595
Hey, I hope you catch the guy, huh?

116
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:20,890
Yeah. No, I already got
a pretty good idea who it is.

117
00:11:20,974 --> 00:11:23,101
Thanks.

118
00:12:18,448 --> 00:12:20,533
What do you want?

119
00:12:20,617 --> 00:12:23,202
- Nothing.
- So take a hike.

<i>You can't order it over the Internet,
so where does it come from?</i>

135

<i>(whistles) Do you believe that?</i>

137
00:13:50,373 --> 00:13:53,418
<i>Well, it's true.

<i>(Squelch)</i>

147

Dervvood, how did you get in here?

148
00:15:06,157 --> 00:15:09,660
Just a little skill I picked up in Chino.

149
00:15:09,869 --> 00:15:12,997
I did a nickel for attempted murder.

150
00:15:13,122 --> 00:15:15,750
You didn't know I was an ex-con?

151
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,544
Yeah, nobody at work did.

152
00:15:18,669 --> 00:15:23,299
Not until this FBI murder investigation
whipped everybody up into a froth.

153
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:31,516
Derwood, what can I do for you?

154
00:15:31,599 --> 00:15:33,810
You know I got fired last night?

155
00:15:35,812 --> 00:15:42,110
Stupid little pissantjob, where they make you
wear a paper hat - and they fired me.

156
00:15:42,193 --> 00:15:45,780
Plus, as far as that
red-headed FBI agent's concerned,

157
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:48,866
I'm the prime suspect in this murder.

158
00:15:48,991 --> 00:15:53,287
But that's no skin off my nose,
seeing as you did it.

159
00:16:02,505 --> 00:16:04,257
Diet pills.

160
00:16:05,299 --> 00:16:07,552
Yours, right?

161
00:16:08,386 --> 00:16:10,888
I found 'em when I opened up
on Saturday morning.

162
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:15,476
I didn't give 'em back because
I figured "Hey, free speed", right?

163
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:19,397
But then there's
this whole flap about a murder.

164
00:16:19,522 --> 00:16:21,607
And I noticed this.

165
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:25,862
That ain't ketchup, man.

166
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:30,283
What... what do you want, Derwood?

167
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:35,121
I don't know. What have you got?

168
00:16:36,414 --> 00:16:41,544
TV, VCR. Ah, it's all crappy, off-brand stuff,

169
00:16:41,627 --> 00:16:45,089
but, yeah, I'll take that, and
whatever money you got in the bank.

170
00:16:45,214 --> 00:16:47,341
And you get this.

171
00:16:47,425 --> 00:16:50,761
And I keep my mouth shut and just maybe

172
00:16:50,845 --> 00:16:55,600
you can blow town before the long arm of the
law reaches out and grabs you by the gonads.

173
00:16:55,725 --> 00:16:57,768
<i>(knocking)</i>

174
00:16:58,769 --> 00:17:00,938
Maybe not.

175
00:17:03,399 --> 00:17:05,943
Cup 'em.

176
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:11,073
Hi, uh, Rob, I hate to bother you, but,

177
00:17:11,157 --> 00:17:16,120
last night, there was a man in a parked car
for hours. Did you happen to see him?

178
00:17:16,871 --> 00:17:19,874
A maroon car. He was clean-cut,
so I didn't call the police,

179
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:23,127
but he was still there when I went to bed.

180
00:17:23,211 --> 00:17:25,588
Gee, Sylvia, I don't know what to tell you.

181
00:17:25,713 --> 00:17:29,217
He's gone now, but just keep
your eyes out in case he comes back.

182
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:31,469
- You got it.
- Thanks.

183
00:17:36,474 --> 00:17:40,478
So I'll call you tonight, let you know
where to drop off my new VCR.

184
00:17:42,230 --> 00:17:45,566
Oh, and don't try skipping town.

185
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:49,779
You won't get too far.

186
00:18:02,792 --> 00:18:05,169
Hey, just the man I wanted to see.

187
00:18:06,796 --> 00:18:09,674
- How are you this morning, Rob?
- Fine.

188
00:18:10,549 --> 00:18:13,636
Glad I caught you.
Oh, I was just driving to your apartment

189
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:16,180
and I saw Dervvood Spinks
not a block from here.

190
00:18:16,264 --> 00:18:20,017
- He wasn't 00min' from your place, was he?
- No, no. I haven't seen him.

191
00:18:20,142 --> 00:18:23,938
Good. I'd stay away from him. He's
our prime suspect in the Pankow murder.

192
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:26,190
- You think he did it?
- Me? No.

193
00:18:26,274 --> 00:18:30,611
No, no. I should say that's the opinion
of the Costa Mesa police, and my partner.

194
00:18:31,112 --> 00:18:33,406
- So, he's not your guy?
- No.

195
00:18:33,531 --> 00:18:38,953
No, I think we're lookin' for somebody who
has a compulsion to kill. Can't help himself.

196
00:18:39,704 --> 00:18:43,791
Oh, quick question.
The meat that you threw in the dumpster...

197
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,627
- What about it?
- The dumpster had a padlock?

198
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:48,796
- Yeah.
- Who would have the key?

199
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:52,675
We do, and the trucking company does.

200
00:18:55,553 --> 00:18:58,389
Hey, wait. What's your point?

201
00:18:59,015 --> 00:19:01,183
I'm just tyin' up some loose ends.

202
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:10,234
<i>(Dr Reinhart) Good. You got my message.
I appreciate your coming.</i>

203
00:19:11,569 --> 00:19:14,238
This will be really informal. Here you go.

204
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:17,116
I wanna run through some things with you.

205
00:19:17,199 --> 00:19:20,995
We don't stand on ceremony,
so if there is anything you wanna talk about,

206
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:24,498
just go ahead and blurt it out, OK?

207
00:19:24,999 --> 00:19:28,377
- It hasn't been a run-of-the-mill week so far.
- No.

208
00:19:28,461 --> 00:19:31,505
The police have been
at the restaurant, the FBI...

209
00:19:31,589 --> 00:19:34,717
I'm sure this has been
a very stressful time for you.

210
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,926
Pretty much.

211
00:19:36,052 --> 00:19:41,307
So we wanna keep on top of any problems
that these stresses might cause for you.

212
00:19:41,432 --> 00:19:45,603
So let's run through
some standard questions together.

213
00:19:47,605 --> 00:19:51,692
Rob, have you been troubled
recently by insomnia?

214
00:19:51,776 --> 00:19:54,612
- Bad dreams or nightmares?
- (stomach rumbles)

215
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:57,865
Have you felt emotionally numb?

216
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:02,661
Do you ever see things
that aren't there or hear voices?

217
00:20:02,745 --> 00:20:06,290
<i>(stomach churning drowns out dialogue)</i>

218
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:13,964
- Tell me, Rob. Do you feel...?
- This... this murder.

219
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:17,468
- This murder that happened...
- Yes?

220
00:20:19,512 --> 00:20:23,182
What kind of a monster
would do something like that?

221
00:20:24,433 --> 00:20:27,395
I don't believe in monsters.

222
00:20:27,478 --> 00:20:29,730
But I do believe in people.

223
00:20:29,814 --> 00:20:35,820
And sometimes they do terrible things
out of weakness, or sickness, or fear.

224
00:20:37,363 --> 00:20:42,493
But I do truly believe that deep down inside,
even the worst of us wants to be good.

225
00:20:44,161 --> 00:20:50,167
Rob, is there anything that's troubling you
that you'd like to talk about?

226
00:20:50,251 --> 00:20:51,919
<i>(Phone)</i>

227
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:55,172
I'm sorry. I thought I'd put that on voice mail.

228
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:00,845
Mindy Reinhart.

229
00:21:00,928 --> 00:21:03,472
Yes, Agent Mulder, what can I do for you?

230
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:07,435
No, I'm afraid I can't do that.

231
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:12,440
I'm sorry, but it would violate
patient confidentiality.

232
00:21:12,523 --> 00:21:15,985
- I, uh...
- Excuse me, Agent.

233
00:21:16,068 --> 00:21:20,364
- Rob?
- Yeah? I have to go to work now.

234
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:24,535
Would you please call me later
so that we could finish our talk?

235
00:21:39,884 --> 00:21:43,554
You shouldn't be here, Dervvood.
We'd have mailed your last cheque.

236
00:21:43,637 --> 00:21:45,723
Just give me my money, Rice.

237
00:21:57,526 --> 00:22:01,822
How you doin', killer? You better
have some money for me too, huh?

238
00:22:01,906 --> 00:22:04,992
There. Now please leave.

239
00:22:05,075 --> 00:22:07,328
With pleasure, pal.

240
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:09,914
Oh, I oughta just make happy hour.

241
00:22:11,457 --> 00:22:14,001
Aw, since this is farewell,

242
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:18,589
when nobody was looking,
I used to dip my boys in the coleslaw.

243
00:22:20,216 --> 00:22:22,259
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

244
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,833
<i>(engine)</i>

245
00:23:28,325 --> 00:23:33,163
If somebody's still in here,
you're in a world of hurt.

246
00:23:39,962 --> 00:23:42,047
<i>(Rob disturbs something)</i>

247
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:49,680
Rob?

248
00:23:56,478 --> 00:23:58,981
You lookin' for these?

249
00:24:00,274 --> 00:24:02,693
Deal's off, buddy.

250
00:24:04,069 --> 00:24:07,031
You know that guy you iced, Pankow?

251
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:11,702
I just heard he didn't have a brain in his head.

252
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:15,539
You're one sick little freak, man.

253
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:19,501
You got a lotta problems.

254
00:24:23,172 --> 00:24:27,009
If I were the FBI, I'd want you real bad.

255
00:24:28,385 --> 00:24:31,055
Public enemy number one, and all that.

256
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,223
Lots of reward money.

257
00:24:35,809 --> 00:24:38,437
So I'm gonna turn you in myself.

258
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,606
Lucky boy.

259
00:25:09,134 --> 00:25:11,512
<i>(knocking)</i>

260
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:16,558
- Rob.
- Hi.

261
00:25:16,642 --> 00:25:20,020
- You said we should finish talking.
- Come in.

262
00:25:29,738 --> 00:25:32,991
- I think I need help.
- Tell me why you think that.

263
00:25:34,034 --> 00:25:37,663
I have compulsions to eat. I... I get hungry.

264
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:40,124
And I try to put it off for as long as I can,

265
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:44,586
but then, finally, I just... I get so hungry
that I can't help myself, and...

266
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:47,131
You binge, then purge?

267
00:25:48,298 --> 00:25:53,512
You eat too much and then
cause yourself to vomit?

268
00:25:53,637 --> 00:25:56,432
No. I just eat.

269
00:25:56,974 --> 00:25:59,518
But this makes you feel bad.

270
00:25:59,977 --> 00:26:03,647
I guess it makes me feel
like I'm not a good person.

271
00:26:03,772 --> 00:26:06,608
There are many different
kinds of eating disorders.

272
00:26:06,692 --> 00:26:09,153
People from every walk of life
suffer from them.

273
00:26:09,278 --> 00:26:13,824
But if there's one thing that they
all have in common, it's low self-esteem.

274
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:18,162
And it's a shame, because low self-esteem
can be like a fun-house mirror.

275
00:26:18,245 --> 00:26:22,332
It reflects back a warped
and ugly image of ourselves.

276
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:27,212
What do you think Cindy Crawford
would look like in a fun-house mirror?

277
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:30,966
Weird? Ugly.

278
00:26:31,049 --> 00:26:34,136
And how would the most
handsome man in the world look?

279
00:26:34,219 --> 00:26:37,347
How would Peter Jennings look
in a fun-house mirror?

280
00:26:37,473 --> 00:26:42,519
- Ugly.
- And how do you look in this mirror?

281
00:26:44,313 --> 00:26:49,693
Do you think that looks like
a bad person, an unworthy person?

282
00:26:49,818 --> 00:26:54,031
I'll tell you what I see.
I see a nice smile.

283
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:58,619
I see soulful brown eyes. I see good.

284
00:26:58,869 --> 00:27:05,334
Now, Rob, I want you to keep looking into
this mirror until you see the same things I do.

285
00:27:05,417 --> 00:27:10,088
There's a meeting I'd like you to attend.
It's every Monday, Wednesday and Friday.

286
00:27:10,422 --> 00:27:13,675
You can talk to me any time,
but these people are the best.

287
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:16,053
They can really help you.

288
00:27:30,359 --> 00:27:33,612
- I have to go.
- You always hurry away.

289
00:27:34,988 --> 00:27:42,412
I appreciate it. And I want you to understand
that I really am trying to do right.

290
00:27:57,886 --> 00:27:59,972
<i>(stomach rumbles)</i>

291
00:28:14,778 --> 00:28:19,199
Hey, Rob, you didn't tell me
you had a friend in the FBI.

292
00:28:19,283 --> 00:28:23,120
He's upstairs. I told him all about
that strange man in the maroon car.

293
00:28:23,203 --> 00:28:25,289
And he said he'd look into it.

294
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:30,627
Afternoon, Rob.

295
00:28:32,337 --> 00:28:35,132
Sir, may we speak with you?

296
00:28:37,092 --> 00:28:42,097
- Derwood Spinks has disappeared.
- His car has gone along with his belongings.

297
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:45,601
My partner saw Spinks
in your neighbourhood yesterday morning.

298
00:28:45,684 --> 00:28:51,690
At that time, you told Agent Mulder that
you hadn't seen Mr Spinks. Is that correct?

299
00:28:51,815 --> 00:28:53,984
I don't even know him that well.

300
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:57,321
If he was going to leave town,
he wouldn't tell me about it.

301
00:28:57,404 --> 00:29:00,824
Who said he left town?

302
00:29:00,908 --> 00:29:03,243
I don't know.

303
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:06,413
- Isn't that what you think happened?
- No, no.

304
00:29:06,496 --> 00:29:09,875
Personally, I think he's dead.
I can't speak for my partner.

305
00:29:09,958 --> 00:29:16,256
But I think that whatever it was that killed
Donald Pankow also got to Derwood Spinks.

306
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,051
What do you mean, whatever "it" was?

307
00:29:19,134 --> 00:29:24,014
I'll let you in on a little secret. We've been
able to keep it pretty quiet up until now,

308
00:29:24,139 --> 00:29:26,934
but Donald Pankow's brain
was missing from his skull.

309
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:29,895
My partner found something
previously undetected.

310
00:29:30,020 --> 00:29:33,398
It was the tip of what can
only be described as a tiny shark's tooth

311
00:29:33,523 --> 00:29:35,984
embedded deep in the bone.

312
00:29:37,027 --> 00:29:39,571
I think we're looking for a genetic freak.

313
00:29:39,655 --> 00:29:44,451
A carnivorous predator as yet unidentified.
A monster, if you will.

314
00:29:46,703 --> 00:29:52,000
- There's no such thing.
- Don't you believe it. This thing qualifies.

315
00:29:52,084 --> 00:29:56,463
It has a biological imperative to eat. I think
it ate that ground chuck you threw away.

316
00:29:56,546 --> 00:29:59,007
Yeah? Why?

317
00:29:59,091 --> 00:30:02,219
Because it can't kill with impunity,
and it knows it.

318
00:30:02,386 --> 00:30:06,390
It knows that the more it feeds on humans,
the closer it gets to getting caught.

319
00:30:06,515 --> 00:30:08,892
But the hunger is always there.

320
00:30:09,017 --> 00:30:11,186
And it satisfies it any way it can.

321
00:30:17,150 --> 00:30:20,821
I'm sorry, but this is like good cop...

322
00:30:21,613 --> 00:30:23,740
insane cop.

323
00:30:24,408 --> 00:30:27,619
Why are you telling me all of this?

324
00:30:28,078 --> 00:30:30,998
I think you know why.

325
00:30:31,081 --> 00:30:35,919
Thank you, Mr Roberts. We'll contact you
if we have any further questions.

326
00:30:40,424 --> 00:30:42,551
Watch out for that monster.

327
00:31:05,282 --> 00:31:11,705
Devil's food, with the white, sugar frosting.
It is like "Deliver me from evil."

328
00:31:13,123 --> 00:31:16,043
Come on in. Come on.

329
00:31:16,501 --> 00:31:21,673
So I baked three dozen of these
for my daughter's school fundraiser.

330
00:31:21,798 --> 00:31:28,221
And at three in the morning, the night before,
there they are, all three dozen of them,

331
00:31:28,305 --> 00:31:32,976
- lined up and calling to me.
- (stomach rumbles)

332
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:38,523
Small world, huh?

333
00:31:40,067 --> 00:31:43,403
- Is this your first time at a meeting?
- Yeah.

334
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:46,448
<i>(applause)</i>

335
00:31:49,117 --> 00:31:52,329
Does anybody else
have anything they wanna share?

336
00:31:53,872 --> 00:31:57,709
Do you feel up to introducing yourself?
Everybody's really nice.

337
00:31:57,793 --> 00:32:00,545
Don't be scared. It helped me.

338
00:32:18,772 --> 00:32:24,152
Uh, hi. My name is Robert Roberts.

339
00:32:24,694 --> 00:32:28,698
- People call me Rob.
- <i>(all)</i> Hi, Rob.

340
00:32:28,824 --> 00:32:36,206
I have an eating disorder. I'm definitely
a meat-eater, not a vegetarian.

341
00:32:37,207 --> 00:32:41,586
I've always had these cravings. My whole life.

342
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:47,717
And just... just recently, the last month or so,

343
00:32:47,801 --> 00:32:50,262
they've just become too powerful to resist.

344
00:32:50,846 --> 00:32:56,726
- Tell us about it.
- I guess it's the taste I respond to the most.

345
00:32:57,394 --> 00:33:01,148
Salty and juicy.

346
00:33:01,231 --> 00:33:04,359
Kind of buttery.

347
00:33:04,442 --> 00:33:07,988
The texture of it, inside of your mouth.

348
00:33:08,405 --> 00:33:14,494
You know, your teeth just
sink into it like this juicy cloud.

349
00:33:14,578 --> 00:33:19,124
And it tastes so good.
You don't even wanna swallow it.

350
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:21,918
You just wanna work it
around your taste buds

351
00:33:22,043 --> 00:33:25,630
until your eyes roll
right back into your head.

352
00:33:29,801 --> 00:33:32,470
Do you remember when I first came here?

353
00:33:48,278 --> 00:33:52,115
Anyway, it's a real problem.

354
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:57,662
Wait, your ex-husband did what?

355
00:33:57,746 --> 00:34:03,251
He said I was too fat to ride in his sports car -
that I'd just mess up the springs.

356
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:06,630
So, I sat on the hood and I bounced.

357
00:34:08,256 --> 00:34:11,176
And I didn't stop until the police showed up.

358
00:34:11,259 --> 00:34:13,303
They sided with me.

359
00:34:14,054 --> 00:34:17,140
Hey, thank you, Sylvia.

360
00:34:17,265 --> 00:34:19,267
Good night, Rob.

361
00:34:20,435 --> 00:34:23,146
Good night, Sylvia.

362
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:32,239
<i>(stomach rumbles)</i>

363
00:34:53,343 --> 00:34:55,387
<i>(Sylvia)</i> I'll <i>be right there.</i>

364
00:35:41,182 --> 00:35:43,310
<i>(screams)</i>

365
00:36:01,745 --> 00:36:04,414
(man) What the hell is goin' on?

366
00:36:04,497 --> 00:36:08,001
Oh, my God! Call the police!

367
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:10,211
(woman) Everything OK?

368
00:36:18,636 --> 00:36:21,765
Mr Derwood Spinks, alive and well?

369
00:36:29,814 --> 00:36:33,777
I'm confused, Rob.
Was he helping you redecorate?

370
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:38,573
- I lied to you before.
- About what?

371
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:44,454
Derwood was coming from my place
the morning you saw him.

372
00:36:44,537 --> 00:36:47,624
He said if I spoke to you, he'd kill me.

373
00:36:47,749 --> 00:36:50,126
What didn't he want you to tell us?

374
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:55,382
Last Friday night, he hung out
while I was cleaning out the freezer.

375
00:36:56,841 --> 00:37:00,220
He told me to go home.
Said he'd finish up.

376
00:37:00,303 --> 00:37:06,810
I... I didn't know why the hell he was being
so nice to me, but when I got home,

377
00:37:07,769 --> 00:37:11,189
I realised I had the key to the dumpster.

378
00:37:12,107 --> 00:37:14,192
And when I drove back,

379
00:37:15,819 --> 00:37:21,324
- I saw him cleaning up all this blood.
- You must have been very scared.

380
00:37:21,533 --> 00:37:25,995
I was, but, you know, I should have
told the truth from the start.

381
00:37:26,704 --> 00:37:28,790
Do you recognise this guy?

382
00:37:34,921 --> 00:37:38,133
- No.
- He's a private eye.

383
00:37:38,216 --> 00:37:42,053
Sylvia Jassie's ex-husband
hired him to spy on her.

384
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:46,307
But now this Steve Kiziak has gone missing.

385
00:37:46,391 --> 00:37:49,853
He was last seen
parked outside your apartment.

386
00:37:49,936 --> 00:37:53,940
- You didn't notice him?
- No, I didn't notice anything.

387
00:37:56,192 --> 00:38:00,780
- Maybe we should check with Sylvia again.
- I don't... I don't think she's home.

388
00:38:00,905 --> 00:38:02,991
Ah, well, we'll track her down.

389
00:38:07,704 --> 00:38:09,956
Don't worry, Rob. It won't be long now.

390
00:38:25,513 --> 00:38:27,599
Oh, my God.

391
00:38:28,224 --> 00:38:31,227
Rob? What happened?

392
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:35,148
It's a long story.

393
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:37,650
What do you want?

394
00:38:37,734 --> 00:38:41,279
I was in the neighbourhood,
and I thought I'd say hi.

395
00:38:43,406 --> 00:38:45,450
Hi.

396
00:38:46,284 --> 00:38:48,578
Rob, are you all right?

397
00:38:53,041 --> 00:38:55,502
Did you do this?

398
00:38:55,585 --> 00:38:59,130
No. Derwood Spinks did this.

399
00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:01,299
You know, he's the one who...

400
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:05,011
Like I said, it's a long story.

401
00:39:05,094 --> 00:39:09,098
- Where are you going?
- To a friend's house.

402
00:39:09,891 --> 00:39:13,019
I have to leave, actually, as in, now.

403
00:39:13,102 --> 00:39:18,274
- Are you sure you're all right?
- Yes, absolutely. I'm fine, you know.

404
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:25,365
It's just that I sensed that there were things
that you wanted to talk about, but couldn't.

405
00:39:25,448 --> 00:39:27,492
That was yesterday.

406
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:35,166
- Well, can we talk about them now?
- Look, let me stop you right there, OK?

407
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:38,378
You don't have to worry about me any more.

408
00:39:38,461 --> 00:39:45,134
As of 10.38am I am no longer employed
by the Lucky Boy corporation.

409
00:39:45,218 --> 00:39:50,223
- I quit.
- Rob, I'm here as a friend.

410
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:52,809
Well, then, consider me cured.

411
00:39:52,892 --> 00:39:56,271
- I had a breakthrough last night.
- Did you attend the OA meeting?

412
00:39:56,354 --> 00:39:58,398
- Yeah.
- How did it go?

413
00:39:58,481 --> 00:40:02,151
It was a complete and utter waste of my time.

414
00:40:02,235 --> 00:40:07,073
- I'm sorry you felt that way.
- So they're a bunch of fat people. So what?

415
00:40:07,156 --> 00:40:13,496
Maybe they've got what you would call
a biological imperative to eat too much.

416
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:17,584
Did you ever think of that? Did you?

417
00:40:17,709 --> 00:40:22,463
You know, maybe I've got
a biological imperative too.

418
00:40:22,547 --> 00:40:27,176
So why is that such a bad thing?
Like the world's gonna end?

419
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:29,512
That is biology.

420
00:40:29,596 --> 00:40:32,974
You can't fight biology. You can't.

421
00:40:33,516 --> 00:40:37,395
- Sounds like you're tired of feeling guilty.
- Bingo.

422
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:42,525
I am sick and tired of pretending
that I'm something that I'm not.

423
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:47,614
You killed that man, didn't you?

424
00:40:59,292 --> 00:41:01,377
What did you just say?

425
00:41:01,502 --> 00:41:04,631
That's why you feel so guilty, isn't it?

426
00:41:06,257 --> 00:41:08,926
Can you tell me why you did it?

427
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:11,387
Who have you been talking to?

428
00:41:11,471 --> 00:41:14,682
No one. I realised it after our last session.

429
00:41:14,766 --> 00:41:18,311
- You spoke to the FBI, didn't you?
- I haven't spoken to anyone.

430
00:41:18,394 --> 00:41:23,941
And I won't without your permission,
but I am here to ask you to turn yourself in.

431
00:41:24,067 --> 00:41:28,071
- <i>(police</i> siren)
- I want you to get the help that you need.

432
00:41:37,205 --> 00:41:39,874
You don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

433
00:41:39,957 --> 00:41:43,336
- Yes, I do, Rob.
- No, you don't!

434
00:41:45,505 --> 00:41:49,801
You said you don't believe in monsters.

435
00:41:49,884 --> 00:41:51,969
Right?

436
00:41:53,137 --> 00:41:57,433
How about now?

437
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:05,775
How about...

438
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:11,114
now?

439
00:42:11,197 --> 00:42:14,701
Do you believe in monsters?

440
00:42:23,626 --> 00:42:26,129
You poor man.

441
00:42:28,423 --> 00:42:30,717
What you must go through.
