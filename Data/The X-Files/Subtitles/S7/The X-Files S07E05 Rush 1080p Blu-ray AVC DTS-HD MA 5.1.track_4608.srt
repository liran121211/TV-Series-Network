1
00:00:46,924 --> 00:00:49,218
Max?

2
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:51,386
Max, you there?

3
00:01:00,145 --> 00:01:02,272
You're late, kid.

4
00:01:04,107 --> 00:01:06,610
- You get lost?
- Sorry.

5
00:01:06,693 --> 00:01:08,570
Had to wait till my mom took off.

6
00:01:08,654 --> 00:01:12,282
It's way past his bedtime, Max.

7
00:01:13,033 --> 00:01:15,535
He's not cut out for this.

8
00:01:15,661 --> 00:01:17,996
Cut out for what?

9
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:21,500
Oh, there's more here than just trees.

10
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,835
Before you can find out what,

11
00:01:23,961 --> 00:01:27,422
I gotta know you're not gonna
tell anyone about this place.

12
00:01:27,506 --> 00:01:28,840
I won't. I swear.

13
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,720
It's a vow, Tony. Don't make it
if you're gonna break it.

14
00:01:33,845 --> 00:01:36,515
I won't break it, man. Not ever.

15
00:01:38,016 --> 00:01:40,143
No matter what?

16
00:01:41,228 --> 00:01:44,231
Even if someone dies tonight?

17
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,528
(Siren)

18
00:02:05,377 --> 00:02:07,129
Anthony Reed.

19
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,717
- Got any outstanding warrants?
- Of course not.

20
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,429
I'm gonna have to check it out,
so put your hands on the vehicle.

21
00:02:15,512 --> 00:02:18,473
- Look, I was just taking a walk.
- Uh-huh?

22
00:02:18,557 --> 00:02:21,768
Right past all those big
"No Trespassing" signs?

23
00:02:21,852 --> 00:02:26,606
- Now, you just stand there for a minute.
- Come on, man. I didn't do anything.

24
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:31,320
I wish I had a nickel for every time I had
to drag you kids out of these woods.

25
00:02:31,403 --> 00:02:34,239
Deputy Foster to dispatch...

26
00:02:37,242 --> 00:02:38,410
(Foster groans)

27
00:02:38,493 --> 00:02:41,204
(woman over radio)
Can you repeat that request?

28
00:02:41,288 --> 00:02:42,414
Sir?

29
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,544
I didn't quite copy your last transmission.

30
00:02:47,627 --> 00:02:49,546
Officer?

31
00:02:54,676 --> 00:02:57,888
Dispatch to Foster. Do you copy?

32
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:08,565
Deputy Foster, this is Dispatch.
Do you copy?

33
00:03:12,736 --> 00:03:16,782
Deputy Foster, sir, what's your 20?

34
00:04:25,809 --> 00:04:29,062
- There you are. Heavy traffic?
- Slow going.

35
00:04:29,146 --> 00:04:32,566
Let's say I had ample time
to read the police report you faxed.

36
00:04:32,649 --> 00:04:37,070
Provided by the local authorities.
It doesn't begin to tell the whole story.

37
00:04:37,154 --> 00:04:40,824
Sheriff's deputy is slain
during a routine patrol.

38
00:04:40,907 --> 00:04:43,785
It's a tragic occurrence,
but I don't see the mystery.

39
00:04:43,869 --> 00:04:47,372
Except that he was beaten to death
by an invisible assailant.

40
00:04:47,456 --> 00:04:50,292
Yes, according to the man
accused of his murder.

41
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,753
One Tony Reed, and I'm guessing
wrongfully accused.

42
00:04:53,837 --> 00:04:58,175
He's an "A" student, moved from
Philadelphia. He's never been in trouble.

43
00:04:58,258 --> 00:05:00,385
Tell me you've got more than SAT scores

44
00:05:00,469 --> 00:05:03,638
to show that this Tony Reed
didn't commit this crime.

45
00:05:03,722 --> 00:05:06,975
Maybe. Take a look at the body.

46
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:20,989
The former Deputy Ronald Foster.

47
00:05:22,157 --> 00:05:26,119
As you can see, the report
doesn't quite do itjustice.

48
00:05:26,203 --> 00:05:29,289
My God, it looks like he was hit
with a sledgehammer.

49
00:05:29,372 --> 00:05:33,293
Police flashlight. One blow.

50
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:42,802
Damage to the maxillofacial bones
and the cranium

51
00:05:42,928 --> 00:05:46,932
is consistent with a blunt-force trauma, but...

52
00:05:47,641 --> 00:05:51,520
I'd say that, uh, Tony eats his Wheaties.

53
00:05:51,603 --> 00:05:54,022
Check out the back of his head.

54
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,785
His eyeglasses.

55
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:09,120
Penetrated to the back of his skull.

56
00:06:09,204 --> 00:06:12,249
Babe Ruth couldn't hit this hard,
let alone a sophomore.

57
00:06:12,332 --> 00:06:16,169
Maybe if he was under the influence
of PCP or some stimulant.

58
00:06:16,294 --> 00:06:18,004
Tox screen came back negative.

59
00:06:18,129 --> 00:06:22,092
Even so, stress and fear may have
triggered an adrenaline response

60
00:06:22,175 --> 00:06:25,887
which is known to enable feats
of near-superhuman strength.

61
00:06:25,971 --> 00:06:29,182
Agent Mulder? How long
you plan on being down here?

62
00:06:29,307 --> 00:06:32,018
Sheriff Harden, this is my partner,
Agent Scully.

63
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:36,147
How long you plan on being down here?
I'd like Ron left in peace.

64
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:40,068
I don't know what there is to see, anyway.
We got the kid who did it.

65
00:06:40,151 --> 00:06:44,114
We don't mean to second-guess you.
We're hoping to be of assistance.

66
00:06:44,197 --> 00:06:47,867
I don't need it. I got the murder weapon
with bloody fingerprints,

67
00:06:47,993 --> 00:06:52,581
and once the state crime lab matches
that up with Tony Reed, it's open and shut.

68
00:06:54,165 --> 00:06:56,960
Well, uh... we're done here. Right?

69
00:06:57,043 --> 00:07:00,005
But, you won't mind if I talk
to Tony Reed, do you?

70
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:05,343
I mean, it won't hurt your case
and if he did do it, you'll want to know why.

71
00:07:17,022 --> 00:07:19,107
What?

72
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:24,821
This is your lucky day for visitors.
This is Agent Scully with the FBI...

73
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:27,574
I'm not talking any more. OK?

74
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:32,579
Well, that might make things worse,
and they seem pretty bad already.

75
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:37,250
In your statement, you say that
Deputy Foster stopped you,

76
00:07:37,334 --> 00:07:39,628
but you don't say why.

77
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:45,216
Come on, you were cruising, right?

78
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,387
A small town like this,
you're not exactly living la vida loca.

79
00:07:49,471 --> 00:07:54,225
I know, I grew up in dullsville, too.
Nothing to do but drive and park.

80
00:07:54,309 --> 00:07:56,686
How long ago was that?

81
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:00,357
Look. Don't you think
I know what you're doing?

82
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,111
You're like the tenth cop who's come in
trying to relate to me till I confess.

83
00:08:05,195 --> 00:08:09,407
If you didn't do it, it's all
the more reason to clear it up.

84
00:08:09,491 --> 00:08:13,078
Everything I know is in my statement.

85
00:08:13,161 --> 00:08:16,414
OK, but bear with us cos we're old and stupid.

86
00:08:16,498 --> 00:08:20,251
How long was it between
the time you heard the scream

87
00:08:20,335 --> 00:08:23,546
to the time that you found Deputy Foster?

88
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:32,138
Tony, you're not likely
to get a fairer hearing than this.

89
00:08:34,724 --> 00:08:37,977
Maybe ten... 15 seconds.

90
00:08:39,938 --> 00:08:44,609
OK, but you didn't see anyone near
the patrol car? You didn't hear anything?

91
00:08:44,693 --> 00:08:49,447
You're still gonna stick with your story
that you were the only one there?

92
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:02,293
I want to go back to my cell.

93
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:16,182
16 years old, and his life is over
unless he starts telling the truth.

94
00:09:16,266 --> 00:09:19,602
If you think he's guilty,
why don't you ask yourself this?

95
00:09:19,686 --> 00:09:22,063
Why wouldn't he make up a plausible cover?

96
00:09:22,147 --> 00:09:25,859
Why didn't he say that a pickup
full of hillbillies drove by

97
00:09:25,942 --> 00:09:28,737
and clobbered the deputy and ran away?

98
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:30,864
I'm not saying he's guilty.

99
00:09:30,947 --> 00:09:34,242
I'm inclined to agree that Tony Reed
did not commit murder,

100
00:09:34,325 --> 00:09:37,245
but I think he saw who did,
and he's covering up for it.

101
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:41,416
I'm not sure there was a person to see.
I think there was a force at work.

102
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:42,792
What kind of force?

103
00:09:42,876 --> 00:09:46,838
I don't know, some kind of territorial
or spiritual entity, maybe.

104
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:51,843
Poltergeists are associated with violent
acts, and manifest around young people.

105
00:09:51,926 --> 00:09:54,596
They're drawn to the turmoil of adolescence.

106
00:09:54,679 --> 00:09:56,806
Mulder...

107
00:09:56,890 --> 00:10:02,729
Rather than spirits, can we
at least start with Tony's friends?

108
00:10:02,812 --> 00:10:04,939
Please? Just... for me?

109
00:10:05,857 --> 00:10:10,236
I think there's one person
in particular I'd like to talk to.

110
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,241
(teacher) Let's wrap it up, people.
Two-minute warning.

111
00:10:34,093 --> 00:10:37,722
There goes half your grade, Max.
You missed the midterm.

112
00:10:37,806 --> 00:10:40,350
Not if I take it right now.

113
00:10:41,893 --> 00:10:45,355
- In one minute?
- Oh, I've been studying.

114
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:54,447
I don't care who your father is.
You fail my test, it sticks.

115
00:10:54,531 --> 00:10:57,992
Well, I guess I better ace it then, huh?

116
00:11:08,628 --> 00:11:10,296
Take your seat, young man.

117
00:11:14,551 --> 00:11:16,010
Piece of cake.

118
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:19,556
It is when you mark them at random.

119
00:11:19,639 --> 00:11:21,391
Go ahead, check it.

120
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:36,698
Maybe I got more going on
than people know.

121
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:38,241
(bell rings)

122
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:51,963
Chastity Raines? I'm Agent Scully.
This is Mulder. We're with the FBI.

123
00:11:52,046 --> 00:11:53,882
Yeah, I remember you.

124
00:11:53,965 --> 00:11:57,051
What did you and Tony
talk about this morning?

125
00:11:57,135 --> 00:12:01,264
- He didn't kill that cop.
- How can you be so sure?

126
00:12:01,347 --> 00:12:03,641
Tonyjust doesn't have it in him.

127
00:12:03,725 --> 00:12:05,059
Do you?

128
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:09,272
Were you there when it happened?

129
00:12:10,732 --> 00:12:12,275
Look, I gotta go.

130
00:12:12,358 --> 00:12:16,654
Do you realise that Tony could go to prison
for the rest of his life for this?

131
00:12:17,572 --> 00:12:21,618
Chastity, if you know something,
now is the time to mention it.

132
00:12:22,410 --> 00:12:27,248
- Without a warrant, you don't have to talk.
- Wow, you must be her lawyer.

133
00:12:27,332 --> 00:12:28,499
Let's go.

134
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:32,921
Butting into our investigation. I wonder
what your father, the sheriff, would think.

135
00:12:33,004 --> 00:12:36,966
- How do you know who my dad is?
- You got the same last name.

136
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:41,554
Oh, you're good. We're done here.
Come on, babe.

137
00:12:41,638 --> 00:12:45,099
You must have been a Betty back in the day.

138
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:48,645
A Betty?

139
00:12:48,728 --> 00:12:49,938
Back in the day.

140
00:12:50,021 --> 00:12:52,106
(cellphone rings)

141
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,735
Scully.

142
00:12:56,945 --> 00:12:59,197
What about the murder weapon?

143
00:12:59,948 --> 00:13:04,202
All I know is, we put the flashlight in here,
and now it's gone.

144
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:06,746
It's like it disappeared into thin air.

145
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:09,123
How many people
have access to this room?

146
00:13:09,207 --> 00:13:14,587
- Me and the deputies under my command.
- What does the tape show?

147
00:13:14,671 --> 00:13:18,716
That no unauthorised persons came in,
and no one went near this locker.

148
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,093
Was this here before?

149
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,012
I don't know.

150
00:13:23,096 --> 00:13:25,974
Can we take a look at the surveillance tape?

151
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:30,645
You can see that the flashlight
was properly secured.

152
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:34,816
It's not like we're running some kind
of a half-assed operation here.

153
00:13:34,899 --> 00:13:38,152
No one's saying that you are, Sheriff.

154
00:13:38,236 --> 00:13:43,741
Here's when the state police came to take it
to the crime lab. There's me going to get it.

155
00:13:43,825 --> 00:13:47,787
We open up the locker and it's gone.

156
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:54,877
I maybe, uh, didn't give y'all the warmest
welcome, but if you have any ideas...

157
00:13:54,961 --> 00:13:56,379
May I?

158
00:13:56,462 --> 00:14:01,342
- I watched it a dozen times.
- Could there be malfunction with the VCR?

159
00:14:01,426 --> 00:14:04,470
I don't see how, plus there's
no gap in the time code.

160
00:14:05,638 --> 00:14:08,683
The murder weapon was
the only hard evidence we had.

161
00:14:08,766 --> 00:14:10,977
Without it, we got no case.

162
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:13,479
You know what I gotta do now?

163
00:14:13,563 --> 00:14:19,652
I gotta call Ron Foster's widow and tell her
that I gotta turn his killer loose.

164
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:30,163
Scully, check this out.

165
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:34,000
What am I supposed to be seeing?

166
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,252
Here it comes.

167
00:14:36,753 --> 00:14:41,215
Now you see it.
One more frame... now you don't.

168
00:14:41,299 --> 00:14:44,093
What do you make of that?
Take another look.

169
00:14:44,177 --> 00:14:46,721
Now it's here... now it's not.

170
00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:05,740
Are you ready to be straight with me?

171
00:15:05,823 --> 00:15:10,495
Leave me alone, Mom.
Would you just leave me alone? I'm tired.

172
00:15:12,163 --> 00:15:16,542
This isn't like a bad report card, Anthony.
A man is dead.

173
00:15:18,211 --> 00:15:20,546
I told you, I didn't do it.

174
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:24,092
It's just that what you say happened
doesn't make sense.

175
00:15:24,175 --> 00:15:28,387
- There's got to be more to it.
- Well, there isn't. OK?

176
00:15:29,972 --> 00:15:33,309
Are those kids involved in this?
That boy, Max?

177
00:15:33,392 --> 00:15:34,936
No.

178
00:15:36,521 --> 00:15:39,398
- They're my only friends.
- You're done seeing them.

179
00:15:39,482 --> 00:15:44,695
- You don't even know them.
- I do know them. I was your age once.

180
00:15:46,864 --> 00:15:50,701
Tony... we came here to get a fresh start,

181
00:15:50,785 --> 00:15:56,165
get away from them bad schools,
the wrong crowd. You are doing so well here.

182
00:15:56,249 --> 00:15:59,293
How would you know?
You're never around.

183
00:16:04,841 --> 00:16:10,638
You think it's my dream to work two jobs?
I'm doing it for you, Tony.

184
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:16,144
I just want to get some sleep.
That's all I want.

185
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:22,108
You got a chance at a good life... a real future.

186
00:16:22,191 --> 00:16:25,611
We didn't come all this way
so you could throw it away.

187
00:16:38,207 --> 00:16:40,793
(Clack)

188
00:16:40,877 --> 00:16:42,962
(Clack)

189
00:16:48,217 --> 00:16:50,303
(Clack)

190
00:17:03,524 --> 00:17:07,695
Listen to that, man. This car's got guts.
Sort of like you that way.

191
00:17:07,778 --> 00:17:10,281
Who's car is this, Max?

192
00:17:11,157 --> 00:17:14,285
Chastity told you to shut up
and things would be fine.

193
00:17:14,368 --> 00:17:15,995
You did. That tells me a lot.

194
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:19,832
Everything's not fine.
We're in a stolen car, a cop is dead.

195
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:23,002
Calm down. He'd been
snooping around. He had to go.

196
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:25,546
What do you mean he had to go?

197
00:17:25,630 --> 00:17:29,425
- What happened out there?
- You gotta learn not to ask questions.

198
00:17:32,094 --> 00:17:35,723
Slow the hell down, man.
You're freaking me out!

199
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:37,683
You ain't seen nothing yet.

200
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:39,060
(tyres screech)

201
00:17:39,143 --> 00:17:41,020
Max, look out!

202
00:18:14,804 --> 00:18:17,306
I'm gonna make you one of us.

203
00:18:18,391 --> 00:18:20,434
But I call the shots.

204
00:18:20,518 --> 00:18:22,937
Always remember that.

205
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:43,541
Hey, Chuck.

206
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:47,086
Sorry to make you trek here
for what's probably a glitch.

207
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:49,880
- What'd you come up with?
- Eyestrain at first.

208
00:18:50,006 --> 00:18:52,508
Then I ran it through my imaging software.

209
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:56,971
I'm here to tell you, it's not a glitch.
It's what the camera saw.

210
00:18:57,054 --> 00:19:01,225
Buckle up. Chuck is about to take us
on a ride through the paranormal.

211
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,019
Well, yes and no.

212
00:19:03,102 --> 00:19:06,856
Initially, I was thinking
spectral manifestation, but, uh,

213
00:19:06,939 --> 00:19:10,901
with spirit activity you'd expect
to see light streaks, auras,

214
00:19:11,027 --> 00:19:14,280
atmospheric disturbances,
translucent figures.

215
00:19:14,405 --> 00:19:17,116
Whatever this is... it's not a ghost.

216
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:21,996
Especially since ghosts don't go around
leaving synthetic polymers in their wake.

217
00:19:22,079 --> 00:19:27,585
- That's what the gunk on the floor was.
- Huh. I dig a mystery with layers.

218
00:19:28,627 --> 00:19:31,797
I get the feeling you don't know
what the hell this is.

219
00:19:31,922 --> 00:19:34,216
I cross-referenced the silhouette

220
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:38,429
against every organic and inorganic object
in the Library of Congress database.

221
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:43,976
The closest match was
a Soviet Akula class submarine.

222
00:19:44,101 --> 00:19:46,604
I think we can rule that out.

223
00:19:46,729 --> 00:19:49,690
And then, there's this weirdness.

224
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:55,821
My enhancement brought up this dark edge
around the anomaly.

225
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:58,449
- A shadow.
- It would fit with the lighting.

226
00:19:58,574 --> 00:20:01,994
The problem is, it can't be
throwing a shadow unless...

227
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,621
Unless it's a solid object.

228
00:20:03,746 --> 00:20:07,083
Which is impossible,
as it only appears for a single frame.

229
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,877
One-thirtieth of a second.

230
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:14,548
You know what? Maybe, uh, SCAG
can give us a clearer picture.

231
00:20:14,632 --> 00:20:19,136
- SCAG?
- Spectrographic Colour Attribute Generator.

232
00:20:19,261 --> 00:20:21,806
I'm, uh, beta-testing it for JPL.

233
00:20:21,931 --> 00:20:27,978
It's still in the tweaking phase but the basic
idea is, I assign known colour values

234
00:20:28,104 --> 00:20:31,315
onto the black-and-white image.

235
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:35,277
Then SCAG assigns chromatic
values throughout the frame.

236
00:20:35,361 --> 00:20:40,157
In effect, making an educated guess
at, uh, what all the colours might be.

237
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:47,498
It still needs fine-tuning.

238
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:51,043
What?

239
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:54,380
You recognise these colours, Scully?

240
00:21:13,566 --> 00:21:15,109
Hey, Tony.

241
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:17,820
Everyone's looking at me like I'm a criminal.

242
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:20,990
I'm not. I heard you took a ride.

243
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:24,452
What was that? How did he do it?

244
00:21:24,535 --> 00:21:26,036
You'll find out.

245
00:21:27,371 --> 00:21:31,709
Maybe you were right...
about me not being cut out for this.

246
00:21:31,834 --> 00:21:35,045
It's a little late for second thoughts.

247
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:39,884
You trying to move in on my girl?

248
00:21:41,051 --> 00:21:42,344
(bell rings)

249
00:21:42,428 --> 00:21:44,096
Saved by the bell.

250
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:02,865
Hey. You wanna stare at someone?
Stare at me.

251
00:22:05,618 --> 00:22:10,498
Well, class... I graded your midterms.

252
00:22:10,581 --> 00:22:14,543
Save for a few of you, the news is not good.

253
00:22:15,211 --> 00:22:19,465
Mr Pembleton... what happened?

254
00:22:20,257 --> 00:22:25,638
Welcome back, Mr Reed.
Expect to make up the test tomorrow.

255
00:22:25,763 --> 00:22:30,267
Mr Harden, you're here on time for a change.

256
00:22:31,769 --> 00:22:33,270
What's this?

257
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:36,106
- Self-explanatory.
- I got every answer right.

258
00:22:36,232 --> 00:22:40,611
- Not because you knew the material.
- Are you saying I cheated? How?

259
00:22:40,736 --> 00:22:44,949
I have no idea how, but you did,
and I won't tolerate it.

260
00:22:52,957 --> 00:22:57,378
(teacher) Back to business, people.
Mr Guider... Mr Baker...

261
00:22:57,461 --> 00:22:59,755
How do I tell Max that I want out?

262
00:23:00,464 --> 00:23:03,175
I wish I could help you, Tony.

263
00:23:03,968 --> 00:23:05,678
I can't even help myself.

264
00:23:21,443 --> 00:23:23,362
(laughter)

265
00:23:36,292 --> 00:23:38,335
(male student) Babbitt!

266
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:41,213
(groans)

267
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,857
(yells)

268
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:07,323
(female student) Oh, my God!

269
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:21,086
Excuse me, please. Thank you.

270
00:24:23,172 --> 00:24:25,549
Just stay back.

271
00:24:27,843 --> 00:24:31,305
I'll show you my theory
if you show me yours.

272
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:34,516
Based on the eyewitness accounts
of the students,

273
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,688
at this moment, I'd have to say
that I don't have one.

274
00:24:39,772 --> 00:24:43,901
- What about for these globs of goo?
- The ones we found in the evidence room?

275
00:24:44,026 --> 00:24:47,321
Yep. I'm guessing Max Harden
could tell us how they got there.

276
00:24:47,404 --> 00:24:50,032
You think Max did this? Based on what?

277
00:24:50,115 --> 00:24:52,242
I spoke to a few students myself.

278
00:24:52,368 --> 00:24:56,789
Max was angry at Mr Babbitt because he
failed him on his midterm. He had motive.

279
00:24:56,914 --> 00:25:00,125
He may have had motive,
but he didn't have opportunity.

280
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:04,963
- Nobody here saw him go near the victim.
- Maybe he didn't need to.

281
00:25:05,089 --> 00:25:06,465
I pulled his records.

282
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:10,803
Rising attendance and discipline problems,
but look at this transcript.

283
00:25:10,928 --> 00:25:14,640
As his behaviour gets worse,
his grades go through the roof.

284
00:25:14,765 --> 00:25:18,852
- This kid has changed.
- He's a teenager. Everything is changing.

285
00:25:18,936 --> 00:25:23,190
His body and his brain chemistry
is in a state of unparalleled upheaval.

286
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:25,984
There's peer pressure and substance abuse.

287
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:28,612
Any one of these could alter his behaviour.

288
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:32,533
What if it's given him a psychokinetic
or paranormal ability

289
00:25:32,616 --> 00:25:36,662
that allows him to exert force over a victim
without laying a finger on him?

290
00:25:36,787 --> 00:25:39,206
- That's your theory?
- Yes, it is.

291
00:25:39,289 --> 00:25:42,126
To be proven as soon as
I get Max in for questioning.

292
00:25:42,251 --> 00:25:45,963
- You needed to speak to Sheriff Harden?
- Yeah, about his son.

293
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:49,633
He's with him now. They're taking him
to the emergency room.

294
00:25:49,758 --> 00:25:52,678
Maxjust collapsed in the parking lot.

295
00:25:57,141 --> 00:26:01,186
You hear about Max? You OK?
Where are you going?

296
00:26:01,311 --> 00:26:05,149
Tony, the less you know, the better, all right?

297
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:19,449
What? No candy? No flowers?

298
00:28:19,533 --> 00:28:23,912
My deputy told me you were coming
and why, so you can just turn right around.

299
00:28:23,996 --> 00:28:27,249
Whatever happened at that school,
my son didn't do it.

300
00:28:27,332 --> 00:28:30,252
We'd like to ask your son a few questions.

301
00:28:30,335 --> 00:28:33,297
He's sick. The doctors
can't even say what's wrong.

302
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:37,342
Max could tell them. You know
why you collapsed, don't you, Max?

303
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:39,469
Yeah, too much teen spirit.

304
00:28:40,137 --> 00:28:42,472
You think? Smells like murder to me.

305
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:45,350
Who do you think you're talking to here?

306
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:47,853
It's not like you got a damn thing on me.

307
00:28:47,978 --> 00:28:50,814
You got a problem with authority, don't you?

308
00:28:50,898 --> 00:28:54,735
If I wasted Babbitt, then how did I do it?
Am I Carrie or something?

309
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:57,446
I used some kind of mental powers?

310
00:28:57,529 --> 00:29:02,409
You figured out a way to tap into something
that gives you superhuman powers.

311
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:06,663
It came in handy with
Babbitt and Deputy Foster.

312
00:29:07,331 --> 00:29:09,416
Man, you're whistlin' Dixie.

313
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:14,963
High temperature and heart rate, low
blood sugar, electrolytes show acidosis.

314
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:20,886
All of these symptoms are consistent
with extreme exertion and withdrawal.

315
00:29:21,011 --> 00:29:24,097
- Withdrawal? From what?
- The rush.

316
00:29:24,181 --> 00:29:26,725
Whatever gives you power
to rearrange furniture

317
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:30,812
and turn a flashlight into a battering ram
also gives you quite a buzz.

318
00:29:30,896 --> 00:29:34,816
If I can do all that, then what's
stopping me from doing it to you?

319
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:40,572
I don't know. Maybe the effect's worn off.
Maybe you need another fix.

320
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:43,617
As soon as I blow out of here,
I'll be sure to get one.

321
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:48,288
That's not gonna happen any time soon.
Your condition's getting worse.

322
00:29:48,372 --> 00:29:52,876
And we're not gonna be able to help you
unless you can tell us what's going on.

323
00:29:54,211 --> 00:29:59,383
- Boy... is any of this true?
- No.

324
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:02,386
You better pray I don't find out it is.

325
00:30:04,054 --> 00:30:06,807
Sir... can we have a word outside?

326
00:30:25,993 --> 00:30:29,705
He's not a bad kid.
He just needs discipline.

327
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:33,542
If your son is in trouble,
I'm sure you'd want to know about it.

328
00:30:33,625 --> 00:30:36,003
We'd like permission to search your house.

329
00:30:36,086 --> 00:30:38,046
You're not getting it.

330
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:43,135
I'm not ready to jump on a bandwagon
and call my boy a murderer.

331
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:51,018
There's some test results
missing from Max's chart.

332
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:53,770
I think we should track them down.

333
00:30:56,106 --> 00:30:58,191
Thanks.

334
00:31:06,616 --> 00:31:09,077
Hot off the presses.

335
00:31:09,161 --> 00:31:11,621
Anything interesting?

336
00:31:11,705 --> 00:31:14,666
- This can't be right.
- What is it?

337
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:18,211
Oh, my God.

338
00:31:18,295 --> 00:31:20,130
What?

339
00:31:20,213 --> 00:31:24,509
Evidence of cerebral lesions
from repeated concussions.

340
00:31:25,469 --> 00:31:28,972
Arthritis in the spine and major joints.

341
00:31:29,639 --> 00:31:32,184
Stress fractures.

342
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:38,023
Numerous muscle and...
and ligament micro-tears.

343
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:42,778
- What would cause this?
- In a teenager? I can't even imagine.

344
00:31:42,861 --> 00:31:45,822
You'd see this in someone
who's crashed race cars

345
00:31:45,906 --> 00:31:48,909
or played pro-football for 15 years.

346
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:54,498
Whatever Max is doing, it's killing him.

347
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:58,168
I think I'm starting to get it.

348
00:32:11,723 --> 00:32:13,850
(beeping)

349
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:34,204
- I thought I saw a young lady come in here.
- I wish.

350
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:51,221
Max Harden's personal effects.

351
00:32:51,304 --> 00:32:53,390
Yeah.

352
00:32:58,603 --> 00:33:01,189
Oh... this is it.

353
00:33:01,273 --> 00:33:04,484
Those globs we found?
This is where they came from.

354
00:33:06,236 --> 00:33:10,740
Speed. Somehow, Max Harden has found
a way to move faster than the eye can see.

355
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:12,868
- Mulder.
- That explains Babbitt.

356
00:33:12,951 --> 00:33:15,871
Also explains how a chair
and table appeared to move

357
00:33:15,954 --> 00:33:20,750
with enough force to penetrate a wall.
Force equals mass times acceleration.

358
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:24,671
It's impossible. The human body
isn't designed to move like that.

359
00:33:24,754 --> 00:33:28,425
Exactly. That is why his is falling apart.

360
00:33:29,426 --> 00:33:31,094
Agents, could you...?

361
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:55,535
Max, please don't do this. You can stop.

362
00:33:55,619 --> 00:33:57,329
Sure, just like you can.

363
00:33:57,454 --> 00:34:00,624
I mean, hurting people.
Haven't enough people been hurt?

364
00:34:00,707 --> 00:34:05,837
This is not why I got you out! Look, let's
just leave here, OK? Let's just go away.

365
00:34:05,962 --> 00:34:08,632
- And do what?
- Find a place to get some help.

366
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:14,888
Help for what? This is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

367
00:34:14,971 --> 00:34:20,310
I can't go back to things standing still...
and neither can you.

368
00:34:33,031 --> 00:34:35,533
Tony, what are you doing here?

369
00:34:35,659 --> 00:34:38,119
You went in that cave, didn't you?

370
00:34:38,203 --> 00:34:40,997
You shouldn't have done that.

371
00:34:41,498 --> 00:34:45,877
It was such a rush. Moving fast like that.

372
00:34:46,002 --> 00:34:49,923
I didn't want this for you.
How did you find it?

373
00:34:50,006 --> 00:34:53,551
I followed you. I was worried about you.

374
00:34:54,928 --> 00:34:56,388
That's so sweet.

375
00:34:57,097 --> 00:35:00,976
I wish things were different
than how they are.

376
00:35:01,059 --> 00:35:06,022
Maybe they can be. With Max in the
hospital, we could go to the cops.

377
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:10,277
He's out.

378
00:36:14,257 --> 00:36:15,842
Oh, my God.

379
00:36:15,925 --> 00:36:18,011
(front door opens)

380
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,314
Hello?

381
00:36:50,126 --> 00:36:52,712
Boo!

382
00:37:02,013 --> 00:37:04,015
You killed Ron Foster.

383
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:07,227
Yeah, I did.

384
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:09,521
Why?

385
00:37:09,646 --> 00:37:12,982
I don't know. You want some great reason?

386
00:37:13,066 --> 00:37:14,901
You little son of a bitch...

387
00:37:16,903 --> 00:37:21,866
He thought he was really something...
always liked to push people around.

388
00:37:22,492 --> 00:37:25,870
Same as Babbitt... and same as you.

389
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:27,580
(gasps)

390
00:37:27,664 --> 00:37:29,999
I'm not afraid of you any more.

391
00:37:36,381 --> 00:37:39,175
I can't let you do this, Max.

392
00:37:56,776 --> 00:37:58,903
Yo, Scully.

393
00:38:01,489 --> 00:38:03,575
How bad are his injuries?

394
00:38:03,658 --> 00:38:07,245
Too soon to tell.
He's unconscious and bleeding internally.

395
00:38:07,328 --> 00:38:12,041
- Apparently from a blow to the abdomen.
- Yeah. Delivered with this.

396
00:38:12,125 --> 00:38:15,920
- Max's weapon of choice against cops.
- Why would he leave it behind?

397
00:38:16,004 --> 00:38:19,299
- To taunt the police?
- No, I think somebody intervened.

398
00:38:19,382 --> 00:38:23,428
I think that's why the Sheriff is still alive
and why his gun is missing.

399
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:27,390
If he can do what you claimed,
then who could possibly intervene?

400
00:38:27,474 --> 00:38:31,019
It's someone who knows exactly
how Max does what he does.

401
00:38:31,686 --> 00:38:36,191
- Someone who's finally standing up to him.
- Tony. How do we find him?

402
00:38:36,274 --> 00:38:39,402
I would guess the source
where Max gets his power from.

403
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:42,697
The woods near where the deputy was killed.

404
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:46,367
Tony never came clean about
what he was doing out there.

405
00:38:46,451 --> 00:38:51,748
Maybe that's why the deputy was killed.
Maybe he got too close to the truth.

406
00:38:54,626 --> 00:38:58,713
Chastity, we don't have to be doing this.
I took care of things with Max.

407
00:38:58,796 --> 00:39:02,800
- No, you didn't. You shouldn't have tried.
- He was gonna kill his father.

408
00:39:02,884 --> 00:39:07,138
You stopped him because he let you.
He was slowing down. You have, too.

409
00:39:07,222 --> 00:39:10,141
If we don't get back to the cave
before Max, we're history.

410
00:39:32,205 --> 00:39:33,623
Hurry!

411
00:39:33,706 --> 00:39:35,833
I'll catch up.

412
00:40:07,115 --> 00:40:09,284
Chastity?

413
00:40:09,367 --> 00:40:11,619
Are you OK?

414
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:13,871
(Max) You're late, kid.

415
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:19,377
- What did you do to her?
- She took a swing at me. You believe that?

416
00:40:20,253 --> 00:40:23,464
You got it all turned around.

417
00:40:36,811 --> 00:40:39,397
Come on, man.

418
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:42,317
Who do you think you're dealing with?

419
00:40:47,030 --> 00:40:50,908
All I ever wanted was for you
to be my friend, Tony.

420
00:40:50,992 --> 00:40:53,995
You stuck a knife in my back.

421
00:40:54,078 --> 00:40:55,663
Now I'm gonna mess you up.

422
00:40:57,081 --> 00:40:58,750
(yells)

423
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:14,974
I'm sorry, Tony. I can't go back.

424
00:41:22,523 --> 00:41:24,734
(gunshot)

425
00:41:51,969 --> 00:41:53,888
Chastity?

426
00:42:18,329 --> 00:42:19,872
Did the USGS show up?

427
00:42:19,956 --> 00:42:25,086
Yeah. 18 geologists and three semis full of
gear. They covered every inch of that cave.

428
00:42:25,169 --> 00:42:28,214
- And what did they come up with?
- Nothing.

429
00:42:28,297 --> 00:42:31,134
Bat guano, above normal
magnetic field readings.

430
00:42:31,217 --> 00:42:34,220
Nothing that would cause
a physiological effect.

431
00:42:34,303 --> 00:42:38,641
- What'd you expect them to find?
- I don't know. A vortex, like in Oregon.

432
00:42:38,725 --> 00:42:42,437
Gravitational aberrations,
unique chemical compositions.

433
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:46,691
Relics that would indicate
that the cave was a sacred site.

434
00:42:46,774 --> 00:42:51,612
You and I were in there. Nothing happened
to us. We're still slowpoking around.

435
00:42:52,905 --> 00:42:55,324
What if we're too old?

436
00:42:55,408 --> 00:42:59,287
You said teenagers differ from adults
chemically and physiologically.

437
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:01,539
What if it affects only them?

438
00:43:01,622 --> 00:43:07,044
Well, that's doubtful.
But, no more so than any other theory.

439
00:43:07,128 --> 00:43:11,299
- I mean, it's worth checking out.
- Yeah? Well, we can't.

440
00:43:11,382 --> 00:43:17,305
They pumped concrete into the cave.
Sealed it for precautionary reasons.

441
00:43:17,388 --> 00:43:18,639
We'll never know.

442
00:43:20,433 --> 00:43:22,769
How's he doing?

443
00:43:22,852 --> 00:43:25,730
Bruises and muscle strains, mostly.

444
00:43:25,813 --> 00:43:29,692
He'll recover... go back to being a normal kid.

445
00:44:07,522 --> 00:44:10,942

446
00:44:32,630 --> 00:44:34,215
(Child) I made this!
