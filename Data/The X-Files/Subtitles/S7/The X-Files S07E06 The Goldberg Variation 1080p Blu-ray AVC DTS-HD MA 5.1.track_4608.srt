1
00:00:12,973 --> 00:00:15,100
Three.

2
00:00:33,285 --> 00:00:35,329
Gimme two.

3
00:00:38,957 --> 00:00:40,292
Two.

4
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,557
Can I have five cards, please?

5
00:00:56,808 --> 00:00:59,436
Five? What, are you serious?

6
00:00:59,978 --> 00:01:02,564
Four's the limit. Let's see your ace.

7
00:01:02,648 --> 00:01:05,400
If Mr Weems wants five...

8
00:01:06,318 --> 00:01:08,779
give him five.

9
00:01:17,496 --> 00:01:19,748
Dealer takes two.

10
00:01:23,752 --> 00:01:25,254
<i>Four.</i>

11
00:01:28,423 --> 00:01:29,841
Nuh-uh.

12
00:01:39,017 --> 00:01:43,188
- How much is that?
- (dealer) Four grand keeps you in.

13
00:01:43,313 --> 00:01:46,108
You and your five shiny new cards.

14
00:01:49,736 --> 00:01:51,822
Here's 4,000.

15
00:01:53,782 --> 00:01:55,701
And four more.

16
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:04,376
Let's make this interesting.
I'm raising you 15 large.

17
00:02:06,336 --> 00:02:10,048
I wouldn't do that. This is all I need.

18
00:02:12,384 --> 00:02:16,013
You're gonna need Depends
after you see this hand.

19
00:02:26,064 --> 00:02:28,483
Now we show each other our cards?

20
00:02:41,371 --> 00:02:43,832
Four kings.

21
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:50,797
(Weems) That's a straight flush, right?

22
00:02:58,388 --> 00:03:00,974
Beginner's luck.

23
00:03:03,185 --> 00:03:06,563
- What the hell do you think you're doin'?
- Going home.

24
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:09,024
No, no. Not so fast.

25
00:03:10,442 --> 00:03:14,112
We expect a chance to win
some of our money back.

26
00:03:17,491 --> 00:03:20,327
Guys, there's over $100,000 here.

27
00:03:20,452 --> 00:03:23,622
You're damn right there is.

28
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:30,962
A hundred thousand's all I need. Sorry.

29
00:03:32,381 --> 00:03:35,467
I had fun, though.

30
00:03:35,926 --> 00:03:38,678
Where can I cash out?

31
00:03:49,564 --> 00:03:53,235
Guys, I think we're going up instead of down.

32
00:03:59,282 --> 00:04:00,700
Guys?

33
00:04:03,537 --> 00:04:06,581
Guys, this is not what I meant
by "cashing out".

34
00:04:06,998 --> 00:04:08,583
Hey!

35
00:04:11,002 --> 00:04:12,754
Hey!

36
00:04:12,838 --> 00:04:14,673
<i>(screams)</i>

37
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,795
<i>(Mulder) Hello?</i>

38
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,464
Yeah, Mulder, it's me. What now?

39
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:22,008
- Are you in Chicago?
- Yes, I'm in Chicago.

40
00:06:22,092 --> 00:06:25,929
I'm on the northeast corner
of 7th and Hunter, just like you asked.

41
00:06:26,012 --> 00:06:29,516
Only you're not here. So where are you?

42
00:06:30,183 --> 00:06:32,727
- Oh, around.
- Yeah?

43
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:35,146
Hey, nice outfit.

44
00:06:37,691 --> 00:06:39,150
Hey.

45
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:41,778
What's down there?

46
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:44,656
Before you check down there, check up there.

47
00:06:46,825 --> 00:06:51,162
Top two floors are leased to Jimmy Cutrona
whose name you might be familiar with.

48
00:06:51,246 --> 00:06:56,626
Organised crime. The Bureau's been trying
to build a racketeering case against him.

49
00:06:56,710 --> 00:06:58,336
Gambling, extortion, murder.

50
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:02,007
That's why last night there were
two agents parked in surveillance.

51
00:07:02,132 --> 00:07:05,594
They witnessed a man being thrown
from Cutrona's roof at 10.40pm.

52
00:07:05,677 --> 00:07:08,263
This man fell for 30 floors,

53
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:11,641
plus the distance down this shaft
because these doors were open.

54
00:07:11,725 --> 00:07:14,102
Straight through, nothin' but net.

55
00:07:14,185 --> 00:07:15,604
Ouch.

56
00:07:15,687 --> 00:07:18,189
I'm guessin' that's what he said.

57
00:07:18,273 --> 00:07:23,194
After he got up, climbed out of here,
and scampered off into the night.

58
00:07:29,284 --> 00:07:32,746
Mulder, you keep saying "this man".
Who is this man?

59
00:07:32,871 --> 00:07:37,375
No idea. He got away. The agents
gave chase, but no clear description.

60
00:07:37,459 --> 00:07:40,045
- Was this basement thoroughly searched?
- No.

61
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:43,298
Technically, falling 300 feet
and surviving isn't a crime.

62
00:07:43,381 --> 00:07:45,383
And your theory is?

63
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:48,303
What if this man had some kind
of special capability?

64
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:54,976
Some kind of genetic predisposition towards
rapid healing or tissue regeneration.

65
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:59,439
So, basically, what if we were
looking for Wile E Coyote?

66
00:08:00,607 --> 00:08:02,984
You're saying that he is invulnerable.

67
00:08:03,068 --> 00:08:04,986
- Right?
- Y...

68
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:10,533
In 1998 a British soldier plummeted 4500 feet
when his parachute failed

69
00:08:10,617 --> 00:08:13,578
and he walked away with a broken rib.

70
00:08:14,913 --> 00:08:16,039
What's your point?

71
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:21,169
My point is that if there is
a wind gust or a sudden updraught

72
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:25,006
and plus if he landed in exactly
the right way, I mean...

73
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:27,217
I don't know, maybe he just got lucky.

74
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:32,806
What if he got really, really lucky?
That's your big scientific explanation, Scully?

75
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:37,352
How many thousand variables would have
to convene for that theory to hold water?

76
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:40,230
- I don't know.
- No. Thousands.

77
00:08:41,231 --> 00:08:43,108
- Mulder?
- Yeah.

78
00:08:43,191 --> 00:08:45,276
Look at this.

79
00:08:46,277 --> 00:08:50,699
If this cart were on the platform when he hit
it'd explain the condition of these wheels.

80
00:08:50,782 --> 00:08:53,952
What if this whole thing had
just enough give to save his life?

81
00:08:54,077 --> 00:08:58,289
- We'd have to find him to ask.
- Yeah, we have to find him.

82
00:09:19,394 --> 00:09:22,564
Looks like maybe we've found
part of him already.

83
00:09:35,618 --> 00:09:37,912
I think you're taking a flier here, Mulder.

84
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:41,458
There must be 600 people
with prosthetic eyes in the Chicago area.

85
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:47,338
Yeah, but only this Henry Weems made an
appointment this morning to get a new one.

86
00:09:48,673 --> 00:09:51,050
Maybe he can't see his way to the door.

87
00:09:56,097 --> 00:09:59,017
Come on, Scully. I'm feelin' lucky.

88
00:10:10,737 --> 00:10:13,698
Can you help me? It's an emergency.

89
00:10:18,244 --> 00:10:20,497
<i>(running water)</i>

90
00:10:22,207 --> 00:10:24,834
- Ma'am, we're not plumbers.
- I didn't say you were.

91
00:10:24,918 --> 00:10:27,670
I just want the damn water turned off
so I can go to work.

92
00:10:27,754 --> 00:10:32,050
You gotta be stronger than me, right?
The valve's under the sink.

93
00:10:37,263 --> 00:10:40,141
Your building super,
Henry Weems, he isn't around?

94
00:10:40,225 --> 00:10:44,103
Mr Dependable? Might as well
wait for Jimmy Hoffa to show up.

95
00:10:49,234 --> 00:10:51,694
You're turning it the wrong way.

96
00:10:51,778 --> 00:10:54,823
- Hey, Richie, sweetheart, back in bed.
- But Mom...

97
00:10:54,906 --> 00:10:58,535
"But"s are for sitting and
I want yours back in bed.

98
00:10:58,910 --> 00:11:01,454
He's right. Clockwise.

99
00:11:01,538 --> 00:11:03,832
I know that.

100
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,834
Clockwise.

101
00:11:26,563 --> 00:11:28,606
You OK, Mulder?

102
00:11:29,107 --> 00:11:32,694
Yeah, it's all right. My ass broke the fall.

103
00:11:32,777 --> 00:11:34,946
Guess who I've found.

104
00:11:35,697 --> 00:11:38,366
Henry Weems, I presume?

105
00:11:50,628 --> 00:11:53,965
Next time leave the plumbing
to a professional.

106
00:11:56,259 --> 00:11:57,760
Oh, uh...

107
00:12:00,388 --> 00:12:03,516
You wanna try this on for size, Cinderella?

108
00:12:11,024 --> 00:12:14,944
Mr Weems, why were you hiding
in a vacant apartment?

109
00:12:15,028 --> 00:12:17,155
Not hiding. Avoiding.

110
00:12:17,238 --> 00:12:20,033
- Avoiding whom?
- You people.

111
00:12:20,158 --> 00:12:22,410
Now you've found me, let's get it over with.

112
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:25,747
No way am I testifying
against Jimmy Cutrona.

113
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:30,168
Last night Cutrona had you thrown off
the roof of 1107 Hunter Avenue.

114
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:32,337
- Correct?
- You didn't hear it from me.

115
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:37,258
I'm not letting you people move me
to Muncie, Indiana to milk cows.

116
00:12:37,383 --> 00:12:42,305
More to the point, you survived
a 300-foot fall, essentially unharmed.

117
00:12:45,433 --> 00:12:51,481
I don't know. Maybe the wind was just right
and I landed on a bunch of towels.

118
00:12:51,606 --> 00:12:54,233
- No biggie.
- You got lucky.

119
00:12:54,317 --> 00:12:58,613
Yeah, I guess, except
you should look at my bruise.

120
00:13:00,698 --> 00:13:02,200
Oh.

121
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:06,287
Plus, I didn't get to keep my poker winnings.

122
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:08,706
That's what you were doing, playing poker?

123
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:14,337
Cutrona thought I was cheating. I wasn't.
But like I said, you didn't hear it from me.

124
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:18,383
It must have been a high-stakes game,
I imagine. Did you win a lot of money?

125
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:20,718
I don't know.

126
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:22,887
A little.

127
00:13:26,975 --> 00:13:29,894
(Mulder) What is that? Did you make it?

128
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:33,022
Uh-huh.

129
00:13:33,356 --> 00:13:34,565
Sort of a hobby.

130
00:13:34,691 --> 00:13:37,360
Mm-hm? Mind if l...?

131
00:14:02,301 --> 00:14:03,761
Ah.

132
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:06,848
That's craftsmanship. What does it mean?

133
00:14:06,931 --> 00:14:09,100
- What do you mean?
- Yeah, what's...

134
00:14:09,183 --> 00:14:13,312
It doesn't mean anything.
I just sorta... I don't know.

135
00:14:13,396 --> 00:14:16,107
It's cause and effect.

136
00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:18,901
So are we done here?

137
00:14:18,985 --> 00:14:23,281
Mr Weems, can I ask you
to reconsider testifying against Cutrona?

138
00:14:23,406 --> 00:14:27,243
- Nope. No way, Jose.
- Well, it would be in your best interest.

139
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:30,246
He's tried to kill you once
and he will do it again.

140
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:32,957
Yeah, we can protect you.

141
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:35,585
I'll take my chances.

142
00:14:41,340 --> 00:14:43,885
So, here's the plan as I see it.

143
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:46,971
We inform the Chicago field office
about Weems,

144
00:14:47,055 --> 00:14:49,849
leaving it to them to secure his testimony.

145
00:14:49,974 --> 00:14:52,101
You change your clothes.

146
00:14:52,185 --> 00:14:56,272
We fly back to DC by sunset,
and all is right with the world.

147
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:59,776
Are you gonna dump this case
just as it's getting interesting?

148
00:14:59,859 --> 00:15:04,447
Interesting, Mulder, was when
we were looking for Wile E Coyote.

149
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:08,868
Come on, Mulder. This guy just got lucky.
There's no X-File here.

150
00:15:08,951 --> 00:15:11,496
Maybe his luck is the X-File.

151
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,793
Stairs.

152
00:15:36,521 --> 00:15:38,648
- Oh.
- What?

153
00:15:40,233 --> 00:15:43,694
Car keys. Must have lost them when I fell.

154
00:15:48,199 --> 00:15:49,450
<i>(buzzer)</i>

155
00:16:28,072 --> 00:16:30,741
So, you get many of these?

156
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:43,087
So, uh, I searched the entire building
and there's no sign of Henry Weems.

157
00:16:43,171 --> 00:16:45,590
I'm guessing that he's on the run.

158
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:49,552
Our dead man's name is Angelo Bellini,
AKA Angie the Animal.

159
00:16:49,635 --> 00:16:54,432
He's an enforcer for the Cutrona family
and I don't think his visit was friendly.

160
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:57,435
You think Weems could have
killed him in self-defence?

161
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:02,023
A skinny guy with no depth-perception
against a man nicknamed the Animal?

162
00:17:02,106 --> 00:17:05,109
I don't think so. We both know
Weems didn't kill anybody.

163
00:17:05,193 --> 00:17:09,280
Besides, we were gone for two minutes.
This guy doesn't have a scratch on him.

164
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:12,074
I'm thinkin' it was a heart attack.

165
00:17:14,327 --> 00:17:16,913
What the hell happened here, Mulder?

166
00:17:16,996 --> 00:17:19,207
Cause and effect.

167
00:17:19,540 --> 00:17:22,835
- Meaning?
- OK. So... watch.

168
00:17:24,045 --> 00:17:28,716
So Bellini kicks down the door -
poised to kill Weems, right?

169
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:32,011
Just as he's about to pull
the trigger a noise startles him.

170
00:17:32,136 --> 00:17:35,223
The buzzer, when I buzzed
to be let back in the apartment.

171
00:17:35,306 --> 00:17:38,893
So when he does pull the trigger
his aim is off, right?

172
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:42,980
And he hits the lamp, which falls over
and knocks over the ironing board.

173
00:17:43,064 --> 00:17:45,942
So as the bullet ricochets
Weems dives over the sofa.

174
00:17:46,025 --> 00:17:49,070
When Bellini goes for him
he trips over the ironing board,

175
00:17:49,195 --> 00:17:55,117
bounces off the chair, flips end over end
and his shoelace gets caught in the fan. QED.

176
00:17:59,038 --> 00:18:04,460
Cause and effect. Seemingly unrelated
and unconnected events and occurrences

177
00:18:04,543 --> 00:18:07,672
that appear unrelated and random beforehand

178
00:18:07,755 --> 00:18:11,676
but which seem to chain-react
in Henry Weems's favour.

179
00:18:12,301 --> 00:18:15,554
- Dumb luck?
- Yeah. He seems to have tapped into it.

180
00:18:15,638 --> 00:18:21,185
He won big at poker. He survived getting
thrown off a skyscraper, and now this.

181
00:18:26,065 --> 00:18:27,817
Hang on a second.

182
00:18:28,276 --> 00:18:31,529
- Hey! Your name's Richie, right?
- Yeah.

183
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:33,739
- I'm Dana.
- Hi.

184
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:38,911
Why don't we, uh, head back to your room?
I'm sure that's what your mom would want.

185
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:50,548
So, I'm guessing you're a sports fan.

186
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:54,927
Which one's your favourite?

187
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:57,972
Well... it used to be basketball,

188
00:18:59,098 --> 00:19:02,893
but now the Bulls suck,
so I think maybe baseball.

189
00:19:03,436 --> 00:19:05,980
I like baseball too.

190
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:15,281
Did Henry make this for you?

191
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:22,121
<i>(bell rings)</i>

192
00:19:33,758 --> 00:19:35,885
That's pretty neat.

193
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:39,680
Yeah. He made it for me
when I was in the hospital.

194
00:19:40,389 --> 00:19:43,309
He said... it's cos...

195
00:19:43,434 --> 00:19:46,228
everything happens for a reason.

196
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:50,441
Only just sometimes it's hard for us to see.

197
00:19:52,193 --> 00:19:55,363
You went to the hospital
because of your liver?

198
00:19:55,446 --> 00:19:57,698
It doesn't work so good.

199
00:20:02,328 --> 00:20:04,622
Police looking for Henry?

200
00:20:04,705 --> 00:20:06,165
Yeah.

201
00:20:06,624 --> 00:20:08,959
They just wanna talk to him.

202
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:13,047
Do you have any idea
where he might have gone?

203
00:20:13,964 --> 00:20:15,549
Mm-nm.

204
00:20:15,633 --> 00:20:18,344
Since I got sick he hardly ever goes out.

205
00:20:21,639 --> 00:20:24,809
- Boy give you any leads?
- He knows nothing.

206
00:20:26,352 --> 00:20:29,397
- Mulder, as to your theory...
- Mm-hm?

207
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:36,278
Why would the world's most supernaturally
lucky man be a building superintendent?

208
00:20:36,362 --> 00:20:40,032
Why doesn't he run down
to the Illinois State Lottery, enter

209
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:43,494
and, you know, he'd win automatically?

210
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:56,549
- How you feelin', pal?
- I'm OK.

211
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:01,345
The police are lookin' for you, though.

212
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:04,306
How come?

213
00:21:04,390 --> 00:21:07,017
Uh, you know...

214
00:21:07,143 --> 00:21:11,188
You do folks a favour,
wire the joint for free cable...

215
00:21:12,898 --> 00:21:15,067
Don't worry about it.

216
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:18,112
You're gonna be OK by yourself for a while?

217
00:21:20,406 --> 00:21:23,367
<i>Where are you gem"?</i>

218
00:21:23,993 --> 00:21:27,455
There somethin' I gotta do
I've been puttin' off.

219
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:32,168
You get some rest.

220
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:39,592
That's it? You got nothing else?

221
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:44,305
OK. Thank you.

222
00:21:48,726 --> 00:21:50,895
Henry Weems has no police record, I assume.

223
00:21:50,978 --> 00:21:56,108
He has no record of any kind. He doesn't
earn enough in a year to file tax returns.

224
00:21:56,192 --> 00:21:59,528
He has no savings account,
no checking account, no insurance.

225
00:21:59,612 --> 00:22:04,533
He doesn't even have a video rental card.
He doesn't even have a driver's licence.

226
00:22:04,617 --> 00:22:08,078
I mean, it's like he's intentionally
stayed off the radar.

227
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:10,664
He's retired from the world.

228
00:22:10,748 --> 00:22:13,167
Ever since December 1989.

229
00:22:14,877 --> 00:22:19,465
When a commuter jet crashed into
Lake Michigan carrying 21 passengers.

230
00:22:19,590 --> 00:22:21,800
- There was one survivor.
- Henry.

231
00:22:21,926 --> 00:22:25,804
Yeah. It's how he lost his eye.
Snowy night, Christmas rush.

232
00:22:25,888 --> 00:22:31,060
He'd been bumped from three flights before
they found a seat for him on that plane.

233
00:22:31,143 --> 00:22:34,522
- And guess what seat number.
- 13?

234
00:22:34,605 --> 00:22:37,233
- On flight seven.
- More good luck, you're saying?

235
00:22:37,316 --> 00:22:39,944
Good or bad, but maybe
that's where it all started.

236
00:22:40,069 --> 00:22:43,656
What if a brand-new Henry Weems
was plucked from the wreckage?

237
00:22:43,781 --> 00:22:47,451
One whose fortunes had been
irrevocably, permanently changed.

238
00:22:47,535 --> 00:22:51,789
Before 1989 Henry held down a job
for nine years at a train yard.

239
00:22:51,956 --> 00:22:56,043
But after the accident, it's like he just
disappeared off the face of the earth.

240
00:22:56,126 --> 00:23:00,130
He severed ties with all of his friends
and moved out to Melrose Park.

241
00:23:00,214 --> 00:23:03,884
There are millions of reasons for that,
including survivor's guilt.

242
00:23:03,968 --> 00:23:07,805
I mean, what doesn't track for me is why
Henry Weems would drop off the map

243
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:10,140
just because he suddenly became very lucky.

244
00:23:10,224 --> 00:23:13,060
What doesn't track for me
is why he's resurfaced,

245
00:23:13,143 --> 00:23:17,147
why he's suddenly decided
to use his luck in this way.

246
00:23:21,318 --> 00:23:24,738
- All right, take care of yourself, brother.
- Later.

247
00:23:30,661 --> 00:23:34,039
- Hey, what's the lottery up to?
- 28 million.

248
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:38,127
- I don't need that much.
- How much do you need, Rockefeller?

249
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:41,005
More like a hundred grand.

250
00:23:45,175 --> 00:23:47,177
Here goes. One dollar.

251
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:58,188
(man) These suck.

252
00:24:07,323 --> 00:24:11,744
<i>(TV) A Melrose Park building superintendent

253
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:16,165
<i>in a case some sources term
"an unusually vicious gangland slaying".</i>

254
00:24:16,248 --> 00:24:19,710
You did it! You won a hundred grand!

255
00:24:22,588 --> 00:24:26,383
- Where do I collect the money?
- (shopkeeper) Man, they'll mail it to you.

256
00:24:26,467 --> 00:24:30,179
$8200 a month for 12 months. Yeah!

257
00:24:30,262 --> 00:24:32,431
That's too long.

258
00:24:36,393 --> 00:24:41,899
- No, please. I wouldn't do that.
- Oh, baby! Oh, sweet baby!

259
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:44,860
Anything in the trash can
is the store's property.

260
00:24:44,943 --> 00:24:48,489
- Yeah, right. In your face.
- No, just throw it away.

261
00:24:48,572 --> 00:24:50,991
Something bad is going to happen.

262
00:24:51,075 --> 00:24:53,243
So long, suckers.

263
00:24:53,369 --> 00:24:55,954
I did it! I won! I won the lottery!

264
00:24:56,038 --> 00:24:59,833
A hundred grand, fools! A hundred grand!

265
00:25:07,341 --> 00:25:10,260
(paramedic) On three. One, two, three.

266
00:25:11,345 --> 00:25:14,181
So, let me get this straight.

267
00:25:14,264 --> 00:25:16,934
This is the man who initially won the money.

268
00:25:17,017 --> 00:25:18,435
- Mm-hm.
- Uh-huh.

269
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:24,358
Once you and he ascertained the accident
victim was still alive, this man fled on foot.

270
00:25:24,441 --> 00:25:26,527
- Mm-hm.
- OK.

271
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:32,199
After which the man who was hit by the truck
handed you the lottery card and said...

272
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:36,203
"Maurice, I want you to have this."

273
00:25:37,788 --> 00:25:39,248
Mm-hm.

274
00:25:40,582 --> 00:25:44,336
- Thank you, Mr Albert, I think that will be all.
- Thank you.

275
00:25:45,879 --> 00:25:50,718
For such a fortunate man a lot of unfortunate
things happen in Henry Weems' wake.

276
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:56,306
Maybe that's part of the package.
Can't have one without the other.

277
00:25:56,390 --> 00:26:01,395
So, Mulder, Henry Weems came here
to buy a lottery ticket. Why?

278
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:08,360
Maybe it's like you said. Why wouldn't the
luckiest man in the world enter the lottery?

279
00:26:09,486 --> 00:26:15,492
Actually, that's exactly what you said,
about an hour after you said it.

280
00:26:31,216 --> 00:26:34,511
Well, he's not in his place
and he's not with Richie.

281
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:40,434
- You think he hid in there?
- He doesn't hide, he avoids.

282
00:26:40,934 --> 00:26:43,896
And pretty damn well, I'd say.

283
00:26:44,438 --> 00:26:48,025
That thing must go all over
the building, Mulder.

284
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:52,070
I'll start with the roof if you wanna
start with the basement.

285
00:27:43,831 --> 00:27:45,457
<i>(rattling)</i>

286
00:28:26,456 --> 00:28:28,250
Hey! Hey!

287
00:28:28,333 --> 00:28:30,961
Watch the rough stuff!

288
00:28:31,044 --> 00:28:33,380
Henry Weems, you're a hard man
to track down.

289
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:35,716
- I'm workin' here.
- Oh?

290
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:40,554
You and I are gonna have a talk.
Just sit right here and don't move, OK?

291
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:42,806
Tough guy-

292
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:49,813
Oh, crap. Not again.

293
00:28:54,985 --> 00:28:57,029
" <i>(thud)</i>
" <i>Uh!</i>

294

295
00:29:31,229 --> 00:29:33,941
Coming through. Excuse us.

296
00:29:44,993 --> 00:29:47,704
- Does it hurt?
- Stings a bit.

297
00:29:48,997 --> 00:29:51,583
But I'll live.

298
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:56,046
Come over here, Henry.
I wanna try something.

299
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:59,383
- What's that about?
- I haven't a clue.

300
00:30:16,316 --> 00:30:18,485
Nine of clubs. You go.

301
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:21,279
- What for?
- I think you know.

302
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:28,745
Oh! You win. Double or nothin'.

303
00:30:34,251 --> 00:30:36,128
Ooh! Tough to beat.

304
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:46,805
- You win again.
- Mulder, what does that prove?

305
00:30:46,888 --> 00:30:51,476
It proves that if we played this 10,000 times
in a row he would win 10,000 times in a row.

306
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,312
He's incapable of losing.

307
00:30:55,313 --> 00:31:00,110
How does it feel to be the luckiest man
in the universe, Henry?

308
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:06,533
It's a nightmare. You've no idea.

309
00:31:06,658 --> 00:31:08,535
No, no, I do.

310
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:11,538
Cos when you get lucky...

311
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:16,585
really, really lucky... the people around you
tend to suffer. Is that right?

312
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:19,463
I think it's a balance thing.

313
00:31:19,546 --> 00:31:23,759
Something good happens to me and
everybody else has to take it in the keister.

314
00:31:23,842 --> 00:31:28,805
So you stay close to home mostly, keep a low
profile, but recently you've ventured further.

315
00:31:28,889 --> 00:31:33,727
- You played poker with those mobsters.
- I figured they could stand the trimming.

316
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:37,272
Bunch of goombah jerks.
They got issues, man.

317
00:31:37,355 --> 00:31:40,484
You don't mind so much
if a few criminals get hurt

318
00:31:40,567 --> 00:31:43,945
but... then you went and
you played the lottery, um...

319
00:31:44,029 --> 00:31:47,324
I knew I shouldn't have done that.
I needed the money.

320
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:48,909
For what?

321
00:31:51,536 --> 00:31:53,789
For Richie, right?

322
00:32:05,592 --> 00:32:08,553
It's the complications from his hepatitis.

323
00:32:09,096 --> 00:32:14,559
He's on every donor list they got
but he's got a rare blood type -

324
00:32:14,643 --> 00:32:16,436
B negative.

325
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,356
And he's CN... something.

326
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:22,359
CMV negative. Cytomegalovirus.

327
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:26,238
There's no way they're gonna
find a donor in time.

328
00:32:27,614 --> 00:32:30,450
There's a treatment programme in England.

329
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:32,619
A hundred grand gets him in.

330
00:32:32,702 --> 00:32:36,998
It's experimental but
it's the best chance he's got now.

331
00:32:41,545 --> 00:32:43,880
- Am I under arrest?
- No.

332
00:32:43,964 --> 00:32:47,717
However, you will need protection
from Cutrona and his men.

333
00:32:55,392 --> 00:32:58,270
I'd say they need protection from me.

334
00:33:01,898 --> 00:33:05,402
I'm sorry, Mulder.
That was utterly irresponsible.

335
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:10,323
You're feeding the delusions of a man who
has had three attempts made upon his life.

336
00:33:10,407 --> 00:33:13,827
You're supposed to talk him
into protective custody, not out of it.

337
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:17,831
I'd agree with you if I thought
his life was in danger.

338
00:33:19,624 --> 00:33:24,129
<i>As it is, he's doing a better job
on Cutrona's organisation than the FBI.</i>

339
00:33:24,254 --> 00:33:26,756
<i>I wonder if we should
make him an honorary agent.</i>

340
00:33:26,882 --> 00:33:32,095
<i>(Scully) Mulder, you're putting an astounding
amount of faith in coincidence and luck.</i>

341
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:35,056
<i>Essentially, you're betting a man's life on it.</i>

342
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:38,310
<i>And even if you believe
in so-called lucky streaks,</i>

343
00:33:38,393 --> 00:33:41,396
<i>you have to know they all eventually end.</i>

344
00:33:52,157 --> 00:33:54,910
Luckiest man in the world?

345
00:33:55,452 --> 00:33:57,829
No, Mulder, I just beat him.

346
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:04,961
- Mulder?
- Come on, Scully.

347
00:34:12,302 --> 00:34:13,637
Henry!

348
00:34:18,308 --> 00:34:20,018
<i>(horn)</i>

349
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:21,436
<i>(Crash)</i>

350
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:47,295
- You're supposed to be resting.
- I am resting.

351
00:34:47,379 --> 00:34:50,340
Playing on the floor doesn't count.

352
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:57,555
- Don't you ever get tired of this thing?
- Henry said it's educational.

353
00:34:57,639 --> 00:35:01,810
Yeah, well, I don't want you believing
everything that Henry says.

354
00:35:02,852 --> 00:35:06,439
- Do you know the police are looking for him?
- He said it's no big deal.

355
00:35:06,523 --> 00:35:08,775
When did you see...?

356
00:35:08,858 --> 00:35:10,527
Mom.

357
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,237
What's wrong?

358
00:35:22,205 --> 00:35:27,377
- How's he doin'?
- Well, he's got a bruised rib and a black eye.

359
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:31,298
It certainly could have been worse.
And don't tell me he just got lucky.

360
00:35:31,381 --> 00:35:33,591
Far from it.

361
00:35:33,675 --> 00:35:39,264
Maybe what you said about streaks is right.
It looks like his has just about run its course.

362
00:35:39,347 --> 00:35:44,352
I don't mean to make light of his misfortune
but maybe it knocked some sense into him.

363
00:35:44,436 --> 00:35:47,314
He's agreed to testify against Cutrona.

364
00:35:50,442 --> 00:35:53,987
- What?
- Our guy from the justice department called.

365
00:35:54,070 --> 00:35:57,198
They're filing a federal warrant today.
This mook Weems...

366
00:35:57,282 --> 00:36:00,160
This mook Weems was street pizza
last I heard from you.

367
00:36:00,243 --> 00:36:02,871
He was. I don't know what it is.

368
00:36:03,371 --> 00:36:05,665
Maybe he has some special ability.

369
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:09,669
He's impervious, or somethin'.

370
00:36:09,753 --> 00:36:14,132
Anyway, we can't get to him.
They got cops all over the hospital.

371
00:36:14,257 --> 00:36:16,926
Who says we have to get to <i>him?</i>

372
00:36:17,677 --> 00:36:21,598
I want the toy Henry made me, Mom.
Can you please go get it?

373
00:36:22,766 --> 00:36:24,559
Uh, sure, honey.

374
00:36:24,642 --> 00:36:27,562
- We gotta go.
- All right. Richie, I will bring it.

375
00:36:27,645 --> 00:36:30,732
I will follow you there.
I will meet you at the hospital, OK?

376
00:36:30,815 --> 00:36:31,983
Mm.

377
00:37:34,462 --> 00:37:37,006
- Did you find her?
- No.

378
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:39,843
You know Cutrona took her
to keep me from testifying.

379
00:37:39,926 --> 00:37:44,264
We're focused on him, but there's
no sign of a kidnapping, no ransom note.

380
00:37:44,347 --> 00:37:48,017
- He's too smart for that.
- It makes it hard to obtain a search warrant.

381
00:37:48,143 --> 00:37:50,520
- We'll get one, though.
- When?

382
00:37:50,937 --> 00:37:53,022
Tomorrow? Next week?

383
00:37:54,816 --> 00:37:57,402
- Could someone sit with him, at least?
- Hold up.

384
00:37:57,485 --> 00:38:02,866
Henry, what if what I said before wasn't true,
that your luck hasn't changed?

385
00:38:02,949 --> 00:38:05,243
Maybe all this is happening for a reason.

386
00:38:05,368 --> 00:38:08,204
So you're saying Maggie
getting taken is a good thing?

387
00:38:08,329 --> 00:38:13,793
No, I'm saying that what looks like bad luck
may not be bad luck, but we can't tell yet.

388
00:38:13,877 --> 00:38:18,798
We're not in that position.
We can't see the forest for the trees.

389
00:38:29,267 --> 00:38:31,352
How is he?

390
00:38:32,061 --> 00:38:36,691
Not good. If they don't find a donor
in the next few hours...

391
00:38:39,736 --> 00:38:42,947
What if everybody that becomes
involved in Henry Weems's life

392
00:38:43,072 --> 00:38:47,452
somehow becomes an integral part
of his luck, including you and I?

393
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:54,000
Mulder, you're speaking as if we're all trapped
in one of those contraptions that he built.

394
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:59,172
- What are you doing?
- Looking for Maggie Lupone.

395
00:39:04,552 --> 00:39:07,680
Luck is the overreaching force
in this investigation.

396
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:10,433
I say we roll with it.

397
00:39:15,438 --> 00:39:18,608
- Yeah, let's call that a dry run.
- Yeah.

398
00:39:34,707 --> 00:39:36,960
Look who came calling.

399
00:39:40,964 --> 00:39:44,634
I wanted to tell you personally
that there's no hard feelings.

400
00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:47,637
I'm not testifying against you.

401
00:39:48,429 --> 00:39:51,266
Just let Maggie Lupone go.

402
00:39:53,184 --> 00:39:57,480
Maggie. I don't know anybody named Maggie.

403
00:39:58,523 --> 00:40:00,775
You know anybody named Maggie?

404
00:40:02,485 --> 00:40:04,737
Fellas, don't jerk me around.

405
00:40:04,821 --> 00:40:06,906
Jerk you around?

406
00:40:07,782 --> 00:40:11,578
You try to cheat me out
of a hundred large, you kill Angie,

407
00:40:11,703 --> 00:40:15,331
you put Sal in the hospital,
I'm jerkin' you around?

408
00:40:18,001 --> 00:40:20,753
I apologise for my choice of words.

409
00:40:20,837 --> 00:40:23,715
Please, just let her go.

410
00:40:23,798 --> 00:40:26,509
Her kid's really sick.

411
00:40:28,052 --> 00:40:30,263
I don't care what happens to me.

412
00:40:30,346 --> 00:40:32,432
You'll care.

413
00:40:33,349 --> 00:40:38,187
By the time I'm finished...
you'll definitely care.

414
00:40:49,532 --> 00:40:52,410
Henry! Richie - how is he?

415
00:40:56,205 --> 00:40:59,167
Not that one. Use the small one.

416
00:41:01,586 --> 00:41:03,880
<i>(Maggie) Hey!</i>

417
00:41:04,964 --> 00:41:06,799
Henry!

418
00:41:25,568 --> 00:41:28,154
Don't you hurt him, you son of a bitch!

419
00:41:28,237 --> 00:41:30,490
<i>(Cutrona) Shut her up!</i>

420
00:41:44,921 --> 00:41:47,048
<i>(Maggie) Henry!</i>

421
00:42:53,990 --> 00:42:58,745
What are the odds for Cutrona being a perfect
match? A thousand to one? A million to one?

422
00:42:58,828 --> 00:43:00,872
Maybe higher.

423
00:43:02,331 --> 00:43:06,127
Maybe everything does happen for a reason.

424
00:43:06,794 --> 00:43:08,880
Whether we see it or not.

425
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:17,972
Maybe your luck is changing.

426
00:43:18,055 --> 00:43:19,599
Maybe.
