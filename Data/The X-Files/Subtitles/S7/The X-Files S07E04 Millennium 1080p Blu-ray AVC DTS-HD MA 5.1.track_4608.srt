1
00:00:05,340 --> 00:00:06,925
(woman) We're so sorry, Becky.

2
00:00:07,009 --> 00:00:10,929
If there's anything we can do for you,
anything at all, just let us know.

3
00:00:11,054 --> 00:00:13,140
(Becky) Thank you so much.

4
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:16,643
It would have meant a lot to him.

5
00:00:17,728 --> 00:00:19,855
Oh, thank you.

6
00:00:21,648 --> 00:00:23,775
Thank you for coming.

7
00:00:33,952 --> 00:00:36,622
Mrs Crouch,

8
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:39,041
I'm sorry for your loss.

9
00:00:39,124 --> 00:00:41,210
Thank you, Mr...?

10
00:00:41,293 --> 00:00:43,212
Johnson.

11
00:00:43,295 --> 00:00:46,006
I worked briefly with your husband.

12
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:49,134
I was impressed by him.

13
00:00:49,968 --> 00:00:51,845
Very much so.

14
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:54,598
Thank you.

15
00:00:54,848 --> 00:00:56,934
Sorry.

16
00:01:16,995 --> 00:01:19,456
Hell of a Christmas, Raymond.

17
00:01:25,003 --> 00:01:27,089
He's at peace now.

18
00:01:28,006 --> 00:01:30,968
That's one small comfort to be drawn.

19
00:01:38,058 --> 00:01:41,019
Didn't even leave a note.

20
00:02:22,477 --> 00:02:26,815
I am the resurrection and the life. He
that believeth in Me, though he were dead,

21
00:02:26,898 --> 00:02:28,775
yet shall he live.

22
00:02:28,859 --> 00:02:32,112
Whosoever liveth and
believeth in Me shall never die.

23
00:02:32,654 --> 00:02:35,991
(continues reciting verse)

24
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:31,129
He that believeth in Me,
though he were dead,

25
00:03:31,254 --> 00:03:33,340
yet shall he live.

26
00:04:20,178 --> 00:04:22,264
(phone rings)

27
00:05:40,592 --> 00:05:42,636
Thank you, ma'am.

28
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:52,312
- Are you with the FBI too?
- Yes, sir.

29
00:05:52,395 --> 00:05:55,482
Look, I know my job.
The man was deceased.

30
00:05:56,191 --> 00:06:00,320
- I'm sorry?
- I understand that he was one of your own.

31
00:06:00,403 --> 00:06:05,033
But these rumours I'm hearing that I put
a living human being into the ground...

32
00:06:05,116 --> 00:06:08,745
You people better get
your facts straight, real fast.

33
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:18,004
Mulder? You been spreading rumours?

34
00:06:18,755 --> 00:06:20,882
Why? Hear any good ones lately?

35
00:06:20,966 --> 00:06:23,593
Not particularly.

36
00:06:23,677 --> 00:06:26,388
So what do you have here?

37
00:06:26,471 --> 00:06:31,393
- Merry Christmas, by the way, Scully.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas to you too.

38
00:06:31,476 --> 00:06:33,687
Grave robbery with a twist.

39
00:06:35,272 --> 00:06:37,399
Check out the head liner, Scully.

40
00:06:38,525 --> 00:06:42,320
Well, it looks like someone
on the inside was trying to get out.

41
00:06:42,404 --> 00:06:46,116
Indeed it does. To answer you,
I haven't been spreading any rumours.

42
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,868
The local PD's been doing
a pretty good job of that,

43
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:52,831
ever since they matched
the fingerprints on the dead man to these.

44
00:06:53,206 --> 00:06:56,334
And to those up there on that headstone.

45
00:06:56,501 --> 00:06:59,087
There's a big, juicy handprint on the back.

46
00:07:02,674 --> 00:07:06,261
What about the person or persons
who did the digging?

47
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:09,889
Well, we got one pile of dirt.

48
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:13,727
I'm guessing one man with a shovel.

49
00:07:15,312 --> 00:07:18,898
Other than that, last night's rain
hasn't left us much to go on.

50
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:22,068
Well, go ahead, Scully, nay-say me.

51
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,780
The body of a FBI agent gets disinterred,
only to climb out on its own

52
00:07:25,864 --> 00:07:27,991
and disappear into the Yuletide night.

53
00:07:28,074 --> 00:07:30,452
- See, you had me up until there.
- Did I?

54
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:34,789
I think it's what you said before.
I think it's a grave robbery with a twist.

55
00:07:34,873 --> 00:07:37,959
You've got the fingerprints
and the torn casket liner.

56
00:07:38,043 --> 00:07:42,964
Most likely it's rigged evidence that's
been faked by whoever exhumed the body.

57
00:07:43,048 --> 00:07:45,967
- Faked for what effect?
- Publicity?

58
00:07:46,051 --> 00:07:48,345
Fear? Rumours?

59
00:07:48,428 --> 00:07:52,932
I mean, I don't know what specific effect,
but nonetheless, it's...

60
00:07:53,725 --> 00:07:57,062
- What?
- Looks like blood.

61
00:08:03,568 --> 00:08:07,155
(recites the resurrection verse very fast)

62
00:08:08,948 --> 00:08:11,034
(banging)

63
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,588
(recites the resurrection verse)

64
00:08:39,854 --> 00:08:44,693
Special Agent Raymond Crouch.
Age 56, married, no children.

65
00:08:44,776 --> 00:08:50,323
After a sterling 21-year career
with the Bureau, he retired in 1993.

66
00:08:50,448 --> 00:08:52,409
Then, earlier this month,

67
00:08:52,492 --> 00:08:58,081
he was found in the garage of his
Tallahassee home, service weapon in hand.

68
00:08:58,957 --> 00:09:01,793
- Definitely self-inflicted?
- I read over the report

69
00:09:01,876 --> 00:09:04,629
and there's no indication otherwise.

70
00:09:04,713 --> 00:09:06,756
How about a motive
for the grave robberies?

71
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:08,842
We've gone through Crouch's cases.

72
00:09:08,925 --> 00:09:11,136
He doesn't seem to have made any enemies.

73
00:09:11,219 --> 00:09:13,054
Same thing with his personal life.

74
00:09:13,138 --> 00:09:18,810
No large debts, no feuds with neighbours,
never a bad word against him.

75
00:09:19,102 --> 00:09:22,480
- Nothing stands out?
- Should something stand out?

76
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,234
Agent Mulder, what's your take on this?

77
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:30,029
Only that I don't think
it was grave robbery per se.

78
00:09:31,364 --> 00:09:34,451
It was necromancy.
The summoning of the dead.

79
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:41,708
It's magic, dating back to shamanism,
with a long tradition in the Christian church.

80
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:47,005
The dead are brought back to life to divulge
arcane knowledge and perform ritual tasks.

81
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,716
So this wacko thought
he was raising the dead?

82
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:52,677
That's what he was doin'. This is a...

83
00:09:54,012 --> 00:09:58,975
That's a magic circle drawn in goat's blood.
The rain washed most of it away.

84
00:09:59,392 --> 00:10:03,563
The blood attracts the undead, while
the circle focuses the necromancer's power,

85
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:07,025
while protecting him
from the spirits that he's conjuring.

86
00:10:07,150 --> 00:10:08,276
OK.

87
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:10,779
He may also desire to wear
the clothes of the dead man

88
00:10:10,862 --> 00:10:13,114
to create a bond between them.

89
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:16,075
You would not want to be
this man's dry-cleaner.

90
00:10:16,159 --> 00:10:20,163
Obviously, there are
clear ritualistic elements to this crime.

91
00:10:20,246 --> 00:10:23,833
But the question is, why were they
directed at Raymond Crouch?

92
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:26,961
That is the question.

93
00:10:27,045 --> 00:10:29,380
Well, let's come up with an answer.

94
00:10:33,051 --> 00:10:35,136
Mulder, Scully, a word, please?

95
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:46,231
Necromancy aside,
this magic circle you mentioned,

96
00:10:46,397 --> 00:10:49,150
what if it looked something like this?

97
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:55,198
It's an Ouroboros, possibly.
Definitely a mystical symbol.

98
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:59,702
The alchemists favoured it. They believed
that it represented all of existence.

99
00:10:59,786 --> 00:11:03,915
I'm thinking more the Millennium Group.
It was their symbol as well.

100
00:11:04,165 --> 00:11:08,169
- Are you familiar with them?
- Somewhat. They were former FBI agents

101
00:11:08,253 --> 00:11:11,422
who offered consulting services
to law enforcement.

102
00:11:11,548 --> 00:11:15,552
- Somehow, they fell into disrepute.
- They operated in extreme secrecy.

103
00:11:15,635 --> 00:11:21,474
They had their own agenda, which was less
than altruistic, if not improper or illegal.

104
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:26,062
And that it was, in fact, a cult based upon
Judaeo-Christian end-time prophecies

105
00:11:26,145 --> 00:11:28,481
concerning the coming millennium.

106
00:11:28,606 --> 00:11:31,776
- Was Raymond Crouch a member?
- I can't seem to find out.

107
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:36,030
The group dissolved several months ago.
They left no paper trail, nothing.

108
00:11:36,114 --> 00:11:43,121
However, I do have three other grave
desecrations all within the last six months.

109
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:51,004
Long Island, Northern California, Arizona.

110
00:11:51,671 --> 00:11:54,924
All three graves contained
the bodies of former FBI agents.

111
00:11:55,216 --> 00:11:57,969
All three were recent suicides.

112
00:11:58,303 --> 00:12:00,346
How long were you going to sit on this?

113
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:03,600
Owing to the Millennium Group's
former ties with the Bureau,

114
00:12:03,683 --> 00:12:06,644
this matter is sensitive, to say the least.

115
00:12:08,855 --> 00:12:16,154
- Investigate them. Keep a low profile.
- I think I know where to start.

116
00:12:19,324 --> 00:12:22,368
- How well do you know this man?
- Only by reputation.

117
00:12:22,493 --> 00:12:25,038
He left VICAP before I got there.

118
00:12:25,121 --> 00:12:29,500
But he's been called the greatest criminal
profiler the Quantico ever produced.

119
00:12:29,584 --> 00:12:32,170
- What's he doing here?
- Good morning.

120
00:12:32,295 --> 00:12:36,591
Apparently, he checked himself in
for a 30-day observation.

121
00:12:36,674 --> 00:12:39,469
I gather the last few years
haven't been kind to him.

122
00:12:39,552 --> 00:12:43,097
He can tell us about the Millennium Group.
He used to consult for 'em.

123
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:46,851
Later, he fought to bring them down
at the expense of his own career.

124
00:12:46,976 --> 00:12:50,396
Single-minded.
Sounds like someone I know.

125
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,566
(TV) ..12-yard line. They are threatening.

126
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:55,735
Frank Black?

127
00:12:57,987 --> 00:13:01,240
My name is Fox Mulder.
This is my partner, Dana Scully.

128
00:13:01,366 --> 00:13:05,119
It's a pleasure to meet you.
Do you mind if we sit down?

129
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:14,128
- Who's playing?
- It's Notre Dame and Boston College.

130
00:13:14,504 --> 00:13:18,341
Ah, the Fighting Irish
and the Golden Eagles, huh?

131
00:13:18,424 --> 00:13:20,510
What can I do for you, agents?

132
00:13:22,136 --> 00:13:27,183
We're working on a case that we feel
you might have some particular insight into.

133
00:13:27,266 --> 00:13:31,229
The death of four FBI agents.
Do you recognise these men?

134
00:13:31,312 --> 00:13:33,731
I do.

135
00:13:36,234 --> 00:13:39,654
All four committed suicide
in the last six months.

136
00:13:41,406 --> 00:13:45,910
All were exhumed from their graves
in a ritual desecration.

137
00:13:46,786 --> 00:13:50,957
They were members of
the Millennium Group, is that correct?

138
00:13:54,127 --> 00:14:00,383
Sir, we've been having a really difficult time
gleaning any information about the group.

139
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:03,302
About its membership, its practices.

140
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:07,515
- I believe you can help us.
- No, thank you.

141
00:14:07,598 --> 00:14:10,018
I'm retired.

142
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:15,398
I think you can tell that
I'm trying to put my life back together.

143
00:14:15,481 --> 00:14:18,776
- I can't get involved in this.
- We're not asking you to.

144
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:21,446
I'm asking you to take a look at the case file.

145
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:22,780
No, thank you.

146
00:14:26,576 --> 00:14:30,038
Mr Black, the day after tomorrow
is January 1st, 2000.

147
00:14:30,872 --> 00:14:35,460
That's the significant date for these people.
That doesn't leave us much time.

148
00:14:38,254 --> 00:14:40,423
Don't you want to see them stopped?

149
00:14:50,475 --> 00:14:54,228
Well, Mr Black,
you are not what I was expecting.

150
00:14:55,104 --> 00:14:57,523
- Agent Mulder.
- Yes.

151
00:14:57,648 --> 00:15:02,153
It's 1st & 18. Just let me
watch this game in peace.

152
00:15:05,323 --> 00:15:08,159
- It's 3rd & 10. Notre Dame.
- Happy New Year.

153
00:15:08,284 --> 00:15:10,328
Same to you.

154
00:15:28,471 --> 00:15:30,348
- Evenin'.
- Hi.

155
00:15:30,473 --> 00:15:32,850
Could I give you a hand?

156
00:15:33,142 --> 00:15:35,394
Oh, no. I'm about done. But thanks.

157
00:15:36,437 --> 00:15:40,650
- Guess I ran over a nail or somethin'.
- Well, I can help you see at least.

158
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:43,569
Well, I've been drivin' all night.
Be good to get home.

159
00:15:43,694 --> 00:15:45,780
Ihearya.

160
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:49,075
(sniffs the air) Man, whew!

161
00:15:51,077 --> 00:15:53,162
What is that?

162
00:15:54,664 --> 00:15:58,126
I think a deer, maybe,
must have died out there in the woods.

163
00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:00,294
(flies buzzing)

164
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:04,590
Sir.

165
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:07,510
What's in the truck?

166
00:16:08,219 --> 00:16:10,555
- Nothing.
- Mind if I take a look?

167
00:16:11,472 --> 00:16:16,060
- There's nothing in there, so...
- Drop that. Take two steps back.

168
00:16:16,185 --> 00:16:18,229
Drop it.

169
00:16:23,734 --> 00:16:25,778
(buzzing)

170
00:16:30,116 --> 00:16:32,201
(recites resurrection verse)

171
00:16:44,046 --> 00:16:47,800
Stand up, there. Stand up!
Let me see your hands!

172
00:16:49,302 --> 00:16:52,263
- (recites verse)
- What?

173
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:54,098
Speak up!

174
00:16:57,894 --> 00:16:59,937
(screaming)

175
00:17:26,047 --> 00:17:28,132
Hey.

176
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,469
I have the men concentrating on the woods.

177
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:34,138
Our necromancer was definitely here.

178
00:17:38,267 --> 00:17:40,394
It's salt. Heavy magic.

179
00:17:41,854 --> 00:17:46,400
If you're gonna tell me that he stopped
by the side of the road to raise the dead -

180
00:17:46,484 --> 00:17:49,695
which I hope you're not-
I've got two things to say to you.

181
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:54,659
One is that his previous circles
were made of blood, not salt, and two...

182
00:17:54,784 --> 00:17:56,869
They were large enough for a body.

183
00:17:56,953 --> 00:18:00,248
This is a protective circle
for one man to stand in.

184
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:04,335
- Protecting himself against what?
- Whatever it was that did that.

185
00:18:05,044 --> 00:18:07,046
Agents!

186
00:18:07,338 --> 00:18:09,715
Over here!

187
00:18:14,845 --> 00:18:16,889
I saw a lump in the ground.

188
00:18:21,852 --> 00:18:24,897
My God.

189
00:18:27,066 --> 00:18:30,778
Bite marks. They look human.

190
00:18:31,070 --> 00:18:33,197
More salt.

191
00:18:45,376 --> 00:18:50,506
"I am he that liveth and was dead; and,
behold, I am alive for evermore, Amen;

192
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:54,010
and have the keys of hell and of death."

193
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:58,764
Book of Revelation. Chapter one, verse 18.

194
00:19:00,391 --> 00:19:02,435
Go, Fighting Irish.

195
00:19:05,479 --> 00:19:07,565
1st&18.

196
00:19:08,816 --> 00:19:11,110
It's not football, it's Revelations.

197
00:19:13,821 --> 00:19:17,158
You wanted to tell us something.
Why not just come out and say it?

198
00:19:17,283 --> 00:19:20,953
I don't know what you're talking about.
I cannot get involved in this.

199
00:19:21,037 --> 00:19:25,249
All right, so you'll occasionally
drop a little arcane hint?

200
00:19:27,585 --> 00:19:31,172
A police officer was murdered, Frank.
Why do you want to play around?

201
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:34,175
Your denials aside,
you know something about that.

202
00:19:34,342 --> 00:19:36,927
You knew that we'd find this.

203
00:19:38,012 --> 00:19:40,598
What are you afraid of?

204
00:19:42,016 --> 00:19:45,061
Losing your daughter.

205
00:19:45,144 --> 00:19:49,315
You're in a custody battle
with the parents of your late wife.

206
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:53,527
I just spoke with your doctor.
That's why you're here.

207
00:19:53,611 --> 00:19:59,325
They claimed I was an unfit father, obsessed
with conspiracy and the end of the world.

208
00:19:59,408 --> 00:20:03,371
That my work meant more to me
than my daughter, Jordan.

209
00:20:03,454 --> 00:20:06,123
The thing is, they were right.

210
00:20:08,292 --> 00:20:10,294
And so you retired.

211
00:20:10,378 --> 00:20:12,880
I will sell insurance. I'll do whatever it takes.

212
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:15,257
I'll get well and I'll jump through hoops,

213
00:20:15,341 --> 00:20:19,220
but I will not mention
the Millennium Group again.

214
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:24,642
But you obviously wanna help.
You dropped that clue on us.

215
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:30,689
Look, Frank, nobody
needs to know about this.

216
00:20:31,774 --> 00:20:35,486
We're just three people
sittin' around talking.

217
00:20:46,414 --> 00:20:50,835
The Book of Revelation describes
the end of the physical world

218
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:54,505
in a battle between heaven and hell,
good against evil.

219
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:58,259
The Millennium Group believed
that that time was upon us.

220
00:20:58,342 --> 00:21:01,429
These four represent a schism in the group.

221
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:04,849
They believe that for the end time to come,

222
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:08,436
man must take an active hand
in bringing that about.

223
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:11,480
- And to that end they committed suicide?
- Yeah.

224
00:21:11,564 --> 00:21:14,442
With the express purpose
of being brought back to life.

225
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,153
The four horsemen of the Apocalypse.

226
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:21,240
These four men bring with them
war, pestilence, famine and death.

227
00:21:21,365 --> 00:21:25,035
So that all the dead of the earth will rise.
Armageddon.

228
00:21:26,245 --> 00:21:30,416
It must begin with the dawn
of the Millennium or not at all.

229
00:21:30,499 --> 00:21:32,585
That's what they believe.

230
00:21:34,587 --> 00:21:37,715
The man you're looking for,
your necromancer,

231
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:40,509
he exhumed these men
in accordance with their wishes.

232
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:42,803
Is he a member of the Millennium Group?

233
00:21:42,887 --> 00:21:49,477
No, they sought him out. He believes
he's doing God's work, but he's mistaken.

234
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,021
Could you tell us a bit more about this man?

235
00:21:52,104 --> 00:21:57,651
He's a white male, 45 to 50.
He's a religious man. No police record.

236
00:21:57,735 --> 00:22:00,112
No fulfilling relationship.

237
00:22:00,404 --> 00:22:02,948
You would pass him
without giving him a glance.

238
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:05,910
So this is the one event
that will give his life meaning?

239
00:22:06,035 --> 00:22:09,330
Yeah. He needs privacy for this.

240
00:22:09,413 --> 00:22:11,957
He'll live alone.

241
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:16,295
Possibly in the house he grew up in.
Most likely, it's a large, rural property,

242
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:18,464
away from prying eyes.

243
00:22:19,131 --> 00:22:23,093
He'll own a truck or a van.
He needs it to transport the bodies.

244
00:22:23,260 --> 00:22:26,263
There'll be high fences.
"No Trespassing" signs.

245
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:28,766
It's a solitary existence.

246
00:22:28,849 --> 00:22:32,311
He's worked around death
all his life, in some capacity.

247
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:34,772
A funeral parlour or a cemetery.

248
00:22:35,105 --> 00:22:38,192
Death comforts him.

249
00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:41,987
He took great care in burying the deputy,
in preparing the body,

250
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:44,782
despite the fact that he feared being caught.

251
00:22:44,865 --> 00:22:47,576
He stapled the lips, sealed the mouth shut.

252
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:52,248
It was to prevent the man from coming back
to life. He believes that, if disturbed,

253
00:22:52,331 --> 00:22:56,585
the deputy will rise from the dead.
It's too soon for that.

254
00:22:56,669 --> 00:22:59,630
So when he realises
the deputy has been discovered,

255
00:22:59,713 --> 00:23:02,258
he'll feel a need to take action.

256
00:23:02,341 --> 00:23:05,094
He'll return to the body first chance he gets.

257
00:23:05,177 --> 00:23:06,887
Rice County Morgue.

258
00:23:07,221 --> 00:23:09,306
I think you'll catch him there.

259
00:23:09,390 --> 00:23:11,892
These four members
of the Millennium Group,

260
00:23:11,976 --> 00:23:17,690
the ones that truly liveth, who were dead,
these are the ones we have to catch.

261
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:22,486
Mr Black. You've got a phone call.
I think it might be your daughter.

262
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:25,489
Thank you. My daughter. Excuse me.

263
00:23:31,662 --> 00:23:34,748
It's more important to track down
four dead bodies than one murderer?

264
00:23:34,832 --> 00:23:37,751
He's not our murderer.
And those four bodies aren't dead.

265
00:23:37,835 --> 00:23:42,006
- And the millennium is 14 hours away.
- These people, even when they were alive,

266
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:46,051
mangled biblical prophecy
to the extent that it's unrecognisable.

267
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:48,721
Our year 2000
is just their artificial deadline.

268
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:53,100
And besides, 2001 is actually
the start of the new millennium.

269
00:23:53,183 --> 00:23:55,227
Nobody likes a math geek, Scully.

270
00:23:55,311 --> 00:23:59,064
Anyway, I think that
Frank's profile is sound.

271
00:23:59,273 --> 00:24:04,278
And I think with it we have the best chance
of finding this necromancer, as you call him.

272
00:24:04,612 --> 00:24:08,616
- So I am going down to the county morgue.
- I absolutely think you should.

273
00:24:08,866 --> 00:24:11,785
- And what are you gonna do?
- Follow the profile.

274
00:24:11,869 --> 00:24:15,372
The deputy was killed on a road
that connects with no major highway.

275
00:24:15,539 --> 00:24:17,750
I think our necromancer lives nearby.

276
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:20,669
I'll do a rundown on
all single landowners in the area.

277
00:24:20,753 --> 00:24:25,466
See where the bodies are buried, since we...
Oh, Scully, would you do me a favour?

278
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:28,636
Don't let anyone remove the staples
from the deputy's mouth.

279
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:31,305
Please, just humour me. Thanks.

280
00:24:50,741 --> 00:24:54,495
Proceeding with the visual
examination of the mouth.

281
00:24:57,581 --> 00:24:59,833
(phone rings)

282
00:24:59,917 --> 00:25:02,002
Jesus.

283
00:25:06,590 --> 00:25:12,680
What appears to be salt
is packed into the victim's mouth.

284
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:15,641
God only knows why.

285
00:25:16,642 --> 00:25:18,769
Am removing it.

286
00:25:33,075 --> 00:25:35,160
(phone rings)

287
00:25:50,050 --> 00:25:52,428
This is Agent Dana Scully with the FBI.

288
00:25:52,511 --> 00:25:56,014
Please do not autopsy the murder victim
that was brought in earlier.

289
00:25:56,098 --> 00:25:57,349
The sheriff's deputy.

290
00:25:57,433 --> 00:26:00,144
If you've already started, stop now.

291
00:26:00,227 --> 00:26:03,313
I'll be there shortly,
and I'll explain when I arrive.

292
00:26:04,982 --> 00:26:06,817
(screams)

293
00:26:12,114 --> 00:26:14,158
Hello?

294
00:26:38,348 --> 00:26:40,476
(phone signal)

295
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:54,800
Where is she?

296
00:28:18,156 --> 00:28:20,409
Sir?

297
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:30,878
How you feelin'?

298
00:28:32,296 --> 00:28:36,133
- All things considered?
- What the hell happened here?

299
00:28:36,216 --> 00:28:39,469
- Who is that man?
- The sheriff's deputy.

300
00:28:40,345 --> 00:28:42,806
The man we found this morning.

301
00:28:42,931 --> 00:28:46,768
He was dead.
And then, somehow, he wasn't.

302
00:28:46,977 --> 00:28:49,021
He attacked me.

303
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:52,232
You shot him?

304
00:28:52,316 --> 00:28:55,068
Three rounds, centre of mass into his chest.

305
00:28:55,152 --> 00:28:57,779
No effect.

306
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:02,451
There's a gunshot wound
to his head as well.

307
00:29:02,576 --> 00:29:06,204
Yeah, this man
Mulder calls the necromancer,

308
00:29:06,288 --> 00:29:08,165
our suspect, he was here too.

309
00:29:08,832 --> 00:29:11,293
He fired that shot with my gun.

310
00:29:12,294 --> 00:29:14,588
He saved me. I have no idea why.

311
00:29:15,505 --> 00:29:18,425
He got away,
but I was in no shape to follow.

312
00:29:19,343 --> 00:29:24,348
Look, sir, I can't even begin to offer
an explanation for what happened.

313
00:29:25,724 --> 00:29:28,268
But I have to say
it is exactly what Mulder feared.

314
00:29:28,352 --> 00:29:33,398
Yeah, which is why I would like to talk to
him. Why isn't he answering his phone?

315
00:30:04,304 --> 00:30:06,723
Well, welcome to the boondocks.

316
00:31:14,124 --> 00:31:16,251
(sings)

317
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:03,233
Hey! Open the door! Open the door!

318
00:33:03,316 --> 00:33:06,820
Open up! Let me out! Hey!

319
00:33:07,779 --> 00:33:11,158
(gunshots)

320
00:33:12,325 --> 00:33:15,370
I haven't heard from him.
He didn't go to the morgue with you?

321
00:33:15,453 --> 00:33:18,331
No, he went looking for our suspect's home.

322
00:33:18,415 --> 00:33:20,792
No one's been able to contact him since.

323
00:33:20,876 --> 00:33:25,088
I've got task-force agents canvassing
the northwestern Maryland area,

324
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:29,342
but it's a large territory to cover
and we're running out of time.

325
00:33:31,261 --> 00:33:36,308
Sir, I'm just afraid that Mulder
may have found what he's looking for.

326
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:42,147
- I need your help in finding him.
- You respected my reasons in the past.

327
00:33:42,230 --> 00:33:47,110
- Please respect 'em now.
- I'm not sure I understand your reasons, sir.

328
00:33:47,194 --> 00:33:51,865
And I'm starting to wonder what this is
all about and how much you know about it.

329
00:33:51,948 --> 00:33:58,121
Mulder mentioned the four Millennium
members "who liveth" and were dead.

330
00:33:59,748 --> 00:34:02,709
Now, this morning,
I saw what he was talking about.

331
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:05,629
You did?

332
00:34:05,754 --> 00:34:09,466
- One of them attacked me.
- I'm sorry.

333
00:34:09,591 --> 00:34:12,469
Now, as crazy as this sounds, I have to ask.

334
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:20,977
Do you believe that the Millennium Group
is capable of bringing about the end time?

335
00:34:23,897 --> 00:34:26,566
Armageddon?

336
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:30,987
I understand their beliefs.
I've spent years trying to unravel them.

337
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:33,740
Make sense of them.

338
00:34:33,823 --> 00:34:36,076
Doesn't mean I believe them myself.

339
00:34:36,243 --> 00:34:38,328
But what if it were true?

340
00:34:39,162 --> 00:34:43,500
Good and evil, which would prevail?

341
00:34:44,626 --> 00:34:46,670
I'm sorry.

342
00:34:57,347 --> 00:35:01,268
Octavia. I'm gonna check myself out.

343
00:35:01,434 --> 00:35:04,729
- You'd like a day pass?
- I won't be coming back.

344
00:35:06,189 --> 00:35:08,233
(growling)

345
00:35:30,797 --> 00:35:32,632
(twig breaks)

346
00:35:40,557 --> 00:35:43,727
Who's there?

347
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:46,646
- It's me.
- You came.

348
00:35:48,356 --> 00:35:51,109
I almost didn't.

349
00:35:51,192 --> 00:35:54,112
We'd given up on ya. Thank God.

350
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:57,157
Thank God.

351
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:59,576
There's someone in the basement.

352
00:35:59,659 --> 00:36:01,661
Policeman.

353
00:36:01,745 --> 00:36:04,164
He killed one of the members.

354
00:36:04,414 --> 00:36:06,583
He shot him in the head.

355
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:10,420
But you're here.

356
00:36:11,588 --> 00:36:13,840
Now we'll have four.

357
00:36:13,923 --> 00:36:15,967
I'm here.

358
00:36:26,603 --> 00:36:30,106
I can't tell you how happy I am.
You were meant to be the fourth.

359
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:32,317
I always knew that.

360
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,403
- I so hoped you'd come around.
- I didn't want to.

361
00:36:35,487 --> 00:36:39,491
The man in the basement-
I told him how to find this place.

362
00:36:40,158 --> 00:36:44,120
You... Why?

363
00:36:44,287 --> 00:36:46,539
I was trying to walk
the straight and narrow.

364
00:36:46,623 --> 00:36:48,333
Leave the Millennium Group behind.

365
00:36:48,541 --> 00:36:54,047
But I know that I can't do that any more.
Now that I know you've succeeded.

366
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:57,008
- You didn't believe the dead would arise.
- No.

367
00:36:57,133 --> 00:36:59,844
You see what the future holds, Frank.

368
00:37:00,303 --> 00:37:04,140
- You know you can't run from it.
- No, I can't run.

369
00:37:04,265 --> 00:37:09,270
You've paid so dearly.
They've taken your daughter from you.

370
00:37:09,354 --> 00:37:11,481
Murdered your wife.

371
00:37:12,982 --> 00:37:15,652
There is no justice in this world.

372
00:37:27,122 --> 00:37:29,207
But there will be in the next.

373
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:36,506
The hour is near.

374
00:37:38,174 --> 00:37:40,969
Are you ready, Frank?

375
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:44,347
I'm ready.

376
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:53,857
I am the resurrection and the life.
He that believeth in Me,

377
00:37:53,982 --> 00:37:56,901
- though he were dead...
- Yet shall he live.

378
00:37:56,985 --> 00:37:59,904
Whosoever liveth and believeth
in Me shall never die.

379
00:38:05,368 --> 00:38:07,036
(Phone)

380
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:11,332
- Scully.
- This is Skinner.

381
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:13,626
We back-checked Frank Black, as you asked.

382
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:17,922
- And?
- He took no calls, except from his daughter.

383
00:38:18,006 --> 00:38:21,009
But the staff took messages
from a Rice County number.

384
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:22,969
That's where I am.

385
00:38:23,052 --> 00:38:25,680
We ran phone records
for the desecration victims.

386
00:38:25,763 --> 00:38:28,933
All four received calls
from this number before their deaths.

387
00:38:29,058 --> 00:38:30,852
I'm gonna need an address.

388
00:38:32,061 --> 00:38:36,691
I'm begging you, please. You know
what the world is. Evil goes unpunished.

389
00:38:36,774 --> 00:38:41,154
The good suffer. There's no future here
but uncertainty and pain.

390
00:38:44,282 --> 00:38:46,367
Let the judgment come.

391
00:38:47,619 --> 00:38:49,871
You're damning yourself, Frank!

392
00:38:49,954 --> 00:38:52,040
Agent Mulder?

393
00:38:54,167 --> 00:38:56,252
Can you hear me?

394
00:38:57,253 --> 00:39:01,216
- Agent Mulder?
- Yeah. I'm down here.

395
00:39:03,551 --> 00:39:06,095
They're all around.

396
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:24,864
- You armed?
- Oh, yeah.

397
00:39:24,948 --> 00:39:27,784
Shoot for the head. That seems to stop 'em.

398
00:39:28,368 --> 00:39:30,370
- There's three of 'em.
- Where?

399
00:39:30,453 --> 00:39:33,289
I don't know. They're hiding.

400
00:40:04,821 --> 00:40:07,323
- Mulder, can you get up?
- I think so.

401
00:40:09,951 --> 00:40:11,578
Look out!

402
00:40:47,655 --> 00:40:49,365
(growling)

403
00:40:53,202 --> 00:40:55,455
(gun clicks)

404
00:41:12,138 --> 00:41:14,807
(TV) There's another shot
of that millennium crystal ball,

405
00:41:14,891 --> 00:41:19,145
and they're gettin' ready to bring in
the new year. They are packed in tonight.

406
00:41:19,228 --> 00:41:24,192
Body heat alone is keeping 'em warm. And
look at it - all the way up past 52nd Street.

407
00:41:24,275 --> 00:41:28,946
That is that X-shaped thing I was
talkin' about before. This is Times Square.

408
00:41:31,074 --> 00:41:32,950
- Mr Black.
- Hi.

409
00:41:33,076 --> 00:41:36,579
Mark Johnson's been taken
for a psychiatric evaluation.

410
00:41:36,704 --> 00:41:40,583
He'll be put under suicide watch,
just as you asked.

411
00:41:40,708 --> 00:41:43,836
- Good.
- And, um...

412
00:41:44,921 --> 00:41:48,091
- What?
- There's someone here to see you.

413
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,929
- Hi, Daddy!
- Hiya, little one.

414
00:41:55,056 --> 00:41:59,977
- Well. Oh, I missed you, sweetheart.
- I missed you too, Daddy.

415
00:42:12,073 --> 00:42:14,117
Let's get outta here.

416
00:42:16,452 --> 00:42:19,288
Frank, good luck with everything.

417
00:42:19,831 --> 00:42:23,459
Agent Mulder, Agent Scully.
I guess this is it.

418
00:42:26,254 --> 00:42:28,256
You're not gonna stay and watch?

419
00:42:28,339 --> 00:42:30,675
We just wanna go home.

420
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,761
Take care of yourselves.

421
00:42:37,056 --> 00:42:39,183
Hug your friends and loved ones tight,

422
00:42:39,308 --> 00:42:43,104
what the heck, whoever that person is
next to you. No time like the present.

423
00:42:43,187 --> 00:42:46,649
Here we go. Ten, nine, eight,

424
00:42:46,774 --> 00:42:49,694
seven, six, five,

425
00:42:49,777 --> 00:42:52,655
four, three, two...

426
00:42:54,157 --> 00:42:56,868
Happy new year 2000.

427
00:43:00,121 --> 00:43:04,000
(crowd sings "Auld Lang Syne")

428
00:43:32,695 --> 00:43:36,449
- The world didn't end.
- No, it didn't.

429
00:43:41,537 --> 00:43:45,124
- Happy new year, Scully.
- Happy new year, Mulder.

(Child) I made this!
