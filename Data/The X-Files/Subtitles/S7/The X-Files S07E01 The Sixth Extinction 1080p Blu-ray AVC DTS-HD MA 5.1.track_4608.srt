<i>In spite of everything I've ever held to be true.</i>

can I reconcile what I see with what I know?</i>

<i>Connections which, for me,
deny all logic and reason.</i>

00:01:01,188 --> 00:01:05,734
<i>What is this source of power
I hold in my hand, this rubbing?</i>

11
00:01:05,817 --> 00:01:10,072
<i>This simple impression

12
00:01:10,155 --> 00:01:13,784
<i>I watched this rubbing

<i>saw you succumb to its spiralling effect.</i>

14
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:22,251
<i>Now I must work to uncover what
your illness prevents you from finding.</i>

15
00:01:22,334 --> 00:01:26,296
<i>In the source of every illness lies its cure.</i>

16
00:01:42,354 --> 00:01:44,022
Who's there?

17
00:01:44,147 --> 00:01:46,191
Who's there?!

18
00:03:44,726 --> 00:03:50,440
(man) He's been quiet for the last
36 hours, but he doesn't sleep.

19
00:03:50,524 --> 00:03:55,112
There's activity in the temporal lobe
we've just never seen.

20
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:59,658
It won't allow his brain to rest or shut down,

21
00:03:59,783 --> 00:04:04,663
manifesting in episodes of aggression,
sometimes against himself.

22
00:04:04,788 --> 00:04:06,790
You can't sedate him?

23
00:04:06,873 --> 00:04:11,962
Yes. We slow him down for short periods
and put him in the neuro ward.

24
00:04:12,087 --> 00:04:15,048
It's the only way we're able to run tests.

25
00:04:15,132 --> 00:04:17,259
But over time...

26
00:04:17,342 --> 00:04:20,262
his brain is going to just die.

Agent Mulder, can you hear me?

30
00:04:53,837 --> 00:04:56,047
Do you know who I am?

31
00:04:57,591 --> 00:05:00,093
It's Skinner. Walter Skinner.

32
00:05:06,016 --> 00:05:09,269
Can we get him outta here
and get him some fresh air at least?

33
00:05:11,146 --> 00:05:14,733
Let him go! He can't breathe!

00:05:24,993 --> 00:05:28,914

Come on, let him go.

00:05:35,545 --> 00:05:37,547
Stay there, Mr Skinner.

38
00:05:37,631 --> 00:05:40,383
No, it's all right. Just let me get up.

00:07:18,773 --> 00:07:20,859
What happened here?

45
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:26,615
They said you speak English.

46
00:07:26,698 --> 00:07:31,328
- What do you want?
- I'm sorry. You must wonder who I am.

47
00:07:31,453 --> 00:07:35,457
I am Amina Ngebe.
I've come to see your discovery.

48
00:07:35,582 --> 00:07:40,253
I asked that no one be told about it.
Nor that I'm here.

49
00:07:40,337 --> 00:07:45,300
Yes. Well, it is still a secret,
but a well-known one, I'm afraid.

50
00:07:45,842 --> 00:07:50,764
Dr Merkmallen called it
the African Internet, God rest him.

51
00:07:52,057 --> 00:07:54,517
You knew Dr Merkmallen?

52
00:07:54,601 --> 00:07:57,979
I too am a professor of biology
at the university.

53
00:07:58,063 --> 00:08:02,734
But hardly one qualified to say
what must have gone on here.

54
00:08:04,069 --> 00:08:05,987
Well...

55
00:08:06,071 --> 00:08:12,786
I was working late last night by lamplight
and, uh, I saw a man who vanished...

56
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:16,998
and then they just swarmed.

57
00:08:19,584 --> 00:08:24,047
You must not let the men know
what happened to you last night-

58
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,591
the vanishing man, none of it.

59
00:08:27,092 --> 00:08:28,677
Why?

60
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:32,430
They are animists,
believing nature is vengeful.

61
00:08:32,514 --> 00:08:36,935
They'll take this as a sign to leave
what you have found alone, a bad omen.

62
00:08:37,018 --> 00:08:41,189
- Caused by the ship out there?
- Caused by God...

63
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:47,612

those men if we are to continue this work.

I don't have much time.

- Stay away from me!

my driver? You're under suspicion already.

- Dr Merkmallen!
- I murdered no one.

85
00:13:02,492 --> 00:13:06,704
But I won't be sent away from here.
I know what we've got.

86
00:13:06,829 --> 00:13:10,917
This craft that's come ashore?
Its extraterrestrial origins?

- You don't even believe in that.
- Nor do you. But here we are.

To read it.

91
00:13:31,229 --> 00:13:34,065
I've spent my life looking for what's out there,

92
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:38,820
the answer to what theologians
have pondered for millennia.

93
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:42,281
The key to everything. To life itself.

94
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:47,829
I've already been threatened by men
in Washington about what I know.

99
00:14:09,726 --> 00:14:12,061
It is a sea of blood.

100
00:15:04,489 --> 00:15:08,409
- Michael Kritschgau.
- It's six o'clock in the morning.

101
00:15:08,493 --> 00:15:11,204
I don't know if you remember me.
My name's Skinner.

102
00:15:11,287 --> 00:15:14,582
- I'm here to talk to you about Fox Mulder.
- I'm listening.

103
00:15:14,707 --> 00:15:18,127
He's in a serious condition, Mr Kritschgau.
He has to talk to you.

104
00:15:18,211 --> 00:15:21,255
I got nothing to say to the man.

105
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:27,595
You know, I had a job...
with a government pension coming.

106
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:31,474
And two years ago, Fox Mulder
asked me to do him a favour -

107
00:15:31,557 --> 00:15:35,520
blow the whistle on Uncle Sam's
UFO propaganda mill.

108
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:39,565
And all it got me was this swanky address.

109
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,527
Look, he doesn't have much time.

110
00:15:44,445 --> 00:15:48,533
Hey, I'm not a doctor.
What is it you think I can do for him?

111
00:15:48,616 --> 00:15:51,410
All I know is that he asked for you.

112
00:15:57,834 --> 00:16:00,378
Can he even recognise me?

113
00:16:01,587 --> 00:16:04,215
To be honest, I don't know.

114
00:16:12,598 --> 00:16:14,475
Agent Mulder?

115
00:16:15,226 --> 00:16:19,564
His brain is on redline. He's on haloperidol
just to stay on the monitors.

116
00:16:19,689 --> 00:16:22,859
- Haloperidol?
- He becomes violently agitated.

117
00:16:22,942 --> 00:16:25,570
He won't speak or sleep
even when he's medicated.

118
00:16:25,653 --> 00:16:30,199
There's activity in part of his brain
they've never seen before.

119
00:16:30,283 --> 00:16:32,535
Was his...?

120
00:16:34,078 --> 00:16:36,164
Was his what?

121
00:16:37,456 --> 00:16:42,253
I started to ask you a question about
his prior mental state, but he anticipated it.

122
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:44,881
Second time.

123
00:16:48,593 --> 00:16:50,344
Agent Mulder?

124
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:58,269
He claimed to be hearing voices.

125
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,861
I might know why
Agent Mulder asked for me.

126
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:11,782
- Doesn't mean I can do anything for him.
- What just happened?

127
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:15,453
I think he responded
to a question that... I didn't ask.

128
00:17:39,143 --> 00:17:42,980
I don't know how long we can keep him.
We could be held responsible.

129
00:17:43,064 --> 00:17:45,149
You asked me to come down here.

130
00:17:45,233 --> 00:17:50,029
You better be prepared to accept
the responsibility, Mr Skinner.

131
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:57,995
- You're going to inject him?
- No. You are.

132
00:17:59,497 --> 00:18:02,625
With a thousand milligrams of phenytoin.

133
00:18:02,708 --> 00:18:06,754
I'm not injecting him with anything,
not till after I talk to his doctor.

134
00:18:06,837 --> 00:18:10,132
- He's being given the wrong treatment.
- You're not a doctor.

135
00:18:10,216 --> 00:18:12,802
But I've seen his condition.

136
00:18:14,053 --> 00:18:16,347
Who do you wanna trust?

137
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:20,434
Seen it where?

138
00:18:20,518 --> 00:18:23,271
In a study.

139
00:18:23,354 --> 00:18:27,566
There's something like ESP
called "remote viewing".

140
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:31,362
- Whose study?
- The company's. The CIA, Mr Skinner.

141
00:18:31,445 --> 00:18:33,531
Extreme subjects went into arrest,

142
00:18:33,656 --> 00:18:38,244
their minds working harder than their
bodies could sustain. They became all brain.

143
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:44,250
Phenytoin was the only thing that could slow
the electrical impulses to a normal rate.

144
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:50,798
Agent Mulder knew about this.

145
00:18:51,257 --> 00:18:54,510
That's why he asked for you.

146
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:37,720
They're coming.

147
00:19:38,721 --> 00:19:40,765
- Who last saw him?
- I'm looking.

148
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:44,769
- I find a patient missing, and nobody knew?
- I just came on. Sorry.

149
00:19:44,894 --> 00:19:47,688
Fox Mulder? He's restrained.
He's not in his bed?

150
00:19:47,772 --> 00:19:50,524
No. How many times can I say it?

151
00:19:56,781 --> 00:19:59,408
He's right here.

152
00:19:59,492 --> 00:20:03,954
- He wasn't here when I came in.
- No, I just found him down the hall.

153
00:20:04,038 --> 00:20:06,332
- I just got him back into bed.
- Who are you?

154
00:20:06,457 --> 00:20:08,459
I'm his boss. And hers.

155
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:11,504
I don't know how he could get up
or pull all this stuff out.

156
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:15,383
Well, I hope someone's calling a doctor
and making a report on this.

157
00:20:15,466 --> 00:20:19,720
- He has got to remain in this bed.
- I'll stay with him.

158
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:25,142
Agent Fowley, why don't you
see if you can help her?

159
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:29,313
That's an order, Agent Fowley.

160
00:20:41,283 --> 00:20:42,868
She knows.

161
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:45,663
- You can read her mind?
- Yeah.

162
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:48,999
- We gotta act fast.
- The doctor's on his way.

163
00:20:49,083 --> 00:20:52,128
- No doctors. Get me Scully.
- I don't know where she is.

164
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:58,926
Look, I know you've been compromised.
I know Krycek is threatening your life.

165
00:20:59,009 --> 00:21:01,095
Blackmailing you.

166
00:21:01,178 --> 00:21:05,474
You don't think I can trust you,
but it's not you that I need.

167
00:21:05,558 --> 00:21:08,144
- Then who?
- Him.

168
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:13,941
Kritschgau. Ask him to prove it.

169
00:21:14,024 --> 00:21:17,319
- Prove what?
- What's causing this.

170
00:21:17,403 --> 00:21:21,532
It's a brain abnormality.
It's how you're able to read minds.

171
00:21:21,615 --> 00:21:25,578
What's causing this is alien.
That's why my doctors can't help me.

172
00:21:25,703 --> 00:21:28,289
I don't believe in aliens. I think you know that.

173
00:21:28,372 --> 00:21:30,207
I do.

174
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,668
That's why I need you.

175
00:21:37,381 --> 00:21:43,429
<i>(Scully) The work here is painstaking -
a slow and tedious piecing together.</i>

176
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:49,310
<i>It appears to be a craft, its skin covered
in the intricate symbols you and I both saw,</i>

177
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:54,190
<i>but which I now understand
are part of a complex communication.</i>

178
00:21:58,068 --> 00:22:04,074
<i>Dr Barnes has broken some of the symbols
into letters using an ancient Navaho alphabet,</i>

179
00:22:04,158 --> 00:22:07,203
<i>and though it has helped
to uncover some of what's here,</i>

180
00:22:07,286 --> 00:22:10,915
<i>it has also made for greater confusion.</i>

181
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:24,970
<i>On the top surface of the craft,
I'm finding words describing human genetics.</i>

182
00:22:29,683 --> 00:22:33,020
<i>Efforts to read the bottom
of the craft have been harder.</i>

183
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:37,983
<i>Our workers were scared away
by phenomena I admit I can't explain</i> -

184
00:22:38,067 --> 00:22:41,487
a <i>sea of blood,</i> a <i>swarm of insects.</i>

185
00:22:42,863 --> 00:22:45,699
<i>But what little we have found
has been staggering</i> -

186
00:22:45,783 --> 00:22:52,414
<i>passages from the Christian Bible,
from pagan religions, from Ancient Sumeria.</i>

187
00:22:52,498 --> 00:22:55,793
<i>Science and mysticism conjoined.</i>

188
00:22:55,876 --> 00:23:00,422
<i>But more than words,
they are somehow imbued with power.</i>

189
00:23:01,632 --> 00:23:07,388
<i>I've ignored warnings to quit this work,
remaining committed to finding answers,</i>

190
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:13,519
<i>afraid only that our secret here won't last,
and that I might be too late.</i>

191
00:23:18,732 --> 00:23:22,903
I have something to show you.
More pieces of the puzzle.

192
00:23:26,323 --> 00:23:28,659
I couldn't believe it.

193
00:23:28,742 --> 00:23:33,122
Thought I was making it up in my head,
that it could not be true.

194
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:36,500
- What?
- What this is.

195
00:23:38,002 --> 00:23:42,756
What the symbols spell out
is a passage from the Koran.

196
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:47,219
Qiyaamah.
The day of final judgement.

197
00:23:48,846 --> 00:23:53,475
On a spacecraft? Teachings of
the ancient prophet Mohammed?

198
00:23:55,936 --> 00:23:58,022
I found more, too.

199
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:04,903
24 panels.

200
00:24:04,987 --> 00:24:07,865
One for each human chromosome.

201
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:15,497
A map of their makeup,
maybe a map of our entire genetic makeup.

202
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,043
A complete human genome.

203
00:24:21,295 --> 00:24:23,797
I mean, it's like...

204
00:24:23,881 --> 00:24:28,093
it's the most beautiful... intricate work of art.

205
00:24:29,845 --> 00:24:32,431
It is the Word of God.

206
00:24:33,265 --> 00:24:35,559
You're wrong.

207
00:24:37,853 --> 00:24:39,897
There is no God.

208
00:24:41,315 --> 00:24:43,567
What's out there on the water

209
00:24:43,692 --> 00:24:48,155
is only what we call "God",
what we call "creation".

210
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:52,576
The spark that ignited the fire
that cooked the old primordial soup.

211
00:24:52,701 --> 00:24:55,788
Made animate from inanimate. Made us.

212
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:59,958
- I believe he is mad from the sun.
- Mad?

213
00:25:00,042 --> 00:25:02,461
I'm perfectly sane.

214
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:05,255
Because today I understand everything -

215
00:25:05,381 --> 00:25:11,345
beginning and end, alpha and omega,
everything in between. It's all been written.

216
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:16,600
- But the word is "extraterrestrial".
- You're sick, Dr Barnes.

217
00:25:16,684 --> 00:25:20,104
You need to get off your feet, lie down.

218
00:25:22,064 --> 00:25:25,109
You think you're going to take the credit?

219
00:25:25,192 --> 00:25:27,653
This is my discovery.

220
00:25:28,737 --> 00:25:30,906
I'm only here to help my friend.

221
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:35,285
You can't help him.
You're wasting your time reading it.

222
00:25:36,995 --> 00:25:40,791
- It has power.
- It <i>is</i> power.

223
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:43,001
The ultimate power.

224
00:25:44,628 --> 00:25:47,756
Your friend just got too close.

225
00:25:57,599 --> 00:26:00,561
No one leaves here before me.

226
00:26:09,528 --> 00:26:14,283
(Kritschgau) We developed this
to test remote-viewing capabilities.

227
00:26:14,366 --> 00:26:16,994
It works much like a card trick.

228
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:22,374
Tap the monitor where the saucer appears
when it appears or when you think it does.

229
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:24,543
All right?

230
00:26:25,002 --> 00:26:27,171
Who ya gonna call?

231
00:26:36,346 --> 00:26:38,348
Now.

232
00:26:38,515 --> 00:26:40,601
Now.

233
00:26:40,809 --> 00:26:42,311
Now.

234
00:26:42,519 --> 00:26:44,021
Now.

235
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:45,063
Now.

236
00:26:45,481 --> 00:26:47,399
Now.

237
00:26:47,608 --> 00:26:49,276
Now.

238
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,153
Now.

239
00:26:51,236 --> 00:26:53,947
All right, Agent Mulder, fine.

240
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:56,533
You're at about 5% accuracy.

241
00:26:56,617 --> 00:26:58,869
- I'm assuming that's low.
- Yeah.

242
00:26:58,994 --> 00:27:04,416
At the CIA, a high degree of ability
was 20%. 25% was extraordinary.

243
00:27:04,541 --> 00:27:09,379
- But I see them in my head.
- You saw his ability. You pointed it out.

244
00:27:09,463 --> 00:27:13,050
Well, our tests show that some people
have psychic ability, sure -

245
00:27:13,133 --> 00:27:16,804
I mean, ESP, clairvoyance, remote viewing -

246
00:27:16,887 --> 00:27:19,932
but it was never attributed to aliens.

247
00:27:20,057 --> 00:27:22,726
You don't wanna believe.

248
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:27,105
You're not looking hard enough.

249
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:38,367
One more time. Faster.

250
00:28:04,852 --> 00:28:08,814
He's ahead of the images.
He's anticipating them.

251
00:28:42,556 --> 00:28:44,141
<i>(clinking)</i>

252
00:29:02,492 --> 00:29:05,245
They've come back!

253
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:07,205
They were dead!

254
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:09,833
They've come back to life!

255
00:29:11,126 --> 00:29:14,004
The ship - it brought them back to life!

256
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:45,994
- We have to get to the police.
- That is where I'm going.

257
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:48,622
This is the road to Abidjan.

258
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:53,001
Stop!

259
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:04,388
That was him.
That was the man I saw in the tent.

260
00:30:04,471 --> 00:30:06,556
In the road.

261
00:30:13,939 --> 00:30:16,692
Some truths are not for you.

262
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:28,829
Are you all right?

263
00:30:29,621 --> 00:30:31,999
Oh, God. What are you doing?

264
00:30:32,082 --> 00:30:36,211
You were cold. I was just feeling
to see if you were still alive.

265
00:30:36,294 --> 00:30:38,672
- What happened to you?
- To me?

266
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:41,675
You slammed on the brakes.
There was a man.

267
00:30:41,758 --> 00:30:43,844
- That's right, in the road.
- No.

268
00:30:43,927 --> 00:30:48,890
He was right there,
sitting right where you are, in your seat.

269
00:30:51,018 --> 00:30:54,354
The men were right. This is a bad sign.

270
00:30:55,897 --> 00:30:58,150
A sign to give up.

271
00:31:03,613 --> 00:31:06,616
- Turn us around.
- Not back to the beach.

272
00:31:07,659 --> 00:31:09,661
No.

273
00:31:09,786 --> 00:31:11,872
I'm going home.

274
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:16,960
(Skinner) Agent Mulder.

275
00:31:19,588 --> 00:31:25,093
Agent Mulder, I don't know if you can hear
me, but we're gonna try to get you outta here.

276
00:31:29,473 --> 00:31:33,268
- AM nurse is on in a minute. We gotta move.
- I don't think he's in any shape.

277
00:31:33,393 --> 00:31:37,481
I'm gonna hit him pretty hard.
Maybe we can get him on his feet.

278
00:31:38,315 --> 00:31:40,609
- What are you doin'?
- I know what you're doing.

279
00:31:40,692 --> 00:31:43,820
- I'm trying to help him.
- No, this isn't about him.

280
00:31:43,904 --> 00:31:47,407
It's about revenge on the government
for destroying your life.

281
00:31:47,491 --> 00:31:52,287
I was destroyed to protect what Mulder knew
all along. Now he's the proof. He's the X-File.

282
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:55,415
We can't keep shooting him full of drugs.
It's gone too far.

283
00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:59,669
How far should it go?
How far would Mulder go?

284
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:38,083
- Hey! What's going on here?
- Let me see your hands. Hands!

285
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:41,795
Step away.

286
00:32:41,878 --> 00:32:45,507
- What the hell do you think you're doing?
- What am I doing?

287
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,176
What are you doing, sir, with this?

288
00:32:50,011 --> 00:32:52,430
I want you to face the wall.

289
00:32:52,514 --> 00:32:55,267
Do you hear me? Face the wall.

290
00:32:57,561 --> 00:33:01,523
- Let me explain.
- What was this man given?

291
00:33:02,357 --> 00:33:04,901
- What was in this syringe?
- Phenytoin.

292
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:07,112
Let me tell you what it does.

293
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:09,823
How much did you give him?
What dosage was this?

294
00:33:09,906 --> 00:33:13,118
- <i>Let me tell you</i> why <i>we did it.</i>
- <i>(rapid beeping)</i>

295
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:16,830
He's going into seizure.

296
00:33:17,539 --> 00:33:19,875
<i>(doctor)</i> Watch <i>his head.</i>

297
00:33:19,958 --> 00:33:21,501
Mr Mulder?

298
00:33:23,587 --> 00:33:26,089
Hold him. Hold him.

299
00:33:46,067 --> 00:33:49,154
<i>(man) Dr Barnes! (speaks African dialect)</i>

300
00:33:50,530 --> 00:33:52,616
<i>(dialect)</i>

301
00:33:54,576 --> 00:33:56,620
Dr Barnes?

302
00:34:00,999 --> 00:34:03,084
I'm so sorry.

303
00:34:21,144 --> 00:34:26,942
I know what's happened to you.
I know what you're suffering from.

304
00:34:27,025 --> 00:34:30,028
I've been sitting back and watching.

305
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:32,822
I know you know.

306
00:34:32,948 --> 00:34:35,867
I know you know about me.

307
00:34:35,951 --> 00:34:40,121
That my loyalties aren't just to you,

308
00:34:40,205 --> 00:34:43,166
but to a man you've grown to despise.

309
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:53,176
You have your reasons, but as you look
inside me now you know that I have mine.

310
00:34:57,138 --> 00:34:58,848
Fox...

311
00:35:01,184 --> 00:35:03,228
Fox, I love you.

312
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:07,190
I've loved you for so long.

313
00:35:09,109 --> 00:35:11,820
You know that, too.

314
00:35:11,903 --> 00:35:14,864
And I won't let you die...

315
00:35:15,031 --> 00:35:17,909
to prove what you are,
to prove what's inside you.

316
00:35:17,993 --> 00:35:20,870
There's no need to prove it.

317
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:23,665
It's been known for so long.

318
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,421
Now we can be together.

319
00:36:26,936 --> 00:36:29,022
Where is he?

320
00:36:30,231 --> 00:36:32,442
Is he still in the hospital?

321
00:36:32,525 --> 00:36:36,488
- Where have you been?
- Is he still at Georgetown Memorial?

322
00:36:36,863 --> 00:36:39,991
- You can't get to him.
- Do you know where he is or don't you?

323
00:36:40,116 --> 00:36:43,703
He's in the neuro-psych ward,
but it's no good. Agent Scully!

324
00:36:43,787 --> 00:36:47,874
I have been on a plane for 22 hours.
I have to see him.

325
00:36:47,957 --> 00:36:53,671
Then I think you should know what you're
gonna see - if you can even get on the ward.

326
00:36:54,964 --> 00:36:57,801
There's been some trouble.

327
00:37:01,221 --> 00:37:04,724
- What kind of trouble?
- I got this man Kritschgau involved.

328
00:37:04,808 --> 00:37:06,935
Kritschgau?

329
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:11,564
It's a long story, but it ended badly.

330
00:37:11,648 --> 00:37:16,611
They've got Mulder under security now
around the clock. I take full responsibility.

331
00:37:16,694 --> 00:37:21,282
- Responsibility for what?
- He can't even communicate, Agent Scully.

332
00:37:21,366 --> 00:37:26,371
They won't treat him because
they don't know what's wrong with him!

333
00:37:32,127 --> 00:37:35,296
They said he was dying.
I had to do something.

334
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:39,467
- He's not dying.
- I'm afraid it's true.

335
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:41,636
He's not dying.

336
00:37:42,512 --> 00:37:47,851
He is more alive than he's ever been.
He's more alive than his body can withstand.

337
00:37:48,518 --> 00:37:53,148
And what's causing it
may be extraterrestrial in origin.

338
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:57,610
I know.

339
00:38:00,238 --> 00:38:03,533
But there's nothing to be done about it.

340
00:38:11,583 --> 00:38:14,544
They're going to deny you access.

341
00:38:14,669 --> 00:38:19,257
Maybe as his partner, but not as his doctor.

343
00:39:07,931 --> 00:39:09,974
He's alive!

344
00:39:10,850 --> 00:39:12,936
He's come back to life!

345
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,356
Holy Mother of God!

346
00:39:29,619 --> 00:39:31,162
Hello?

349
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,637
<i>I need to see him.</i>

350
00:40:30,597 --> 00:40:32,515
<i>I'm begging you, please.</i>

351
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:37,103
Thank you.

352
00:40:49,699 --> 00:40:52,452
Mulder, it's me.

353
00:40:52,535 --> 00:40:55,496
I know that you can hear me.

354
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:58,875
If you can just give me some sign.

355
00:41:02,879 --> 00:41:05,840
I want you to know where I've been.

356
00:41:06,758 --> 00:41:08,885
What I found.

357
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:15,933
I think that if you know,
that you could find a way to hold on.

358
00:41:19,103 --> 00:41:21,397
I need you to hold on.

359
00:41:25,568 --> 00:41:28,154
I found a key...

360
00:41:28,237 --> 00:41:30,239
the key...

361
00:41:30,323 --> 00:41:33,660
to every question that has ever been asked.

362
00:41:36,579 --> 00:41:38,665
It's a puzzle...

363
00:41:39,582 --> 00:41:42,919
but the pieces are there for us to put together.

364
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:48,591
And I know that they can save you
if you can just hold on.

365
00:41:51,594 --> 00:41:53,429
Mulder...

366
00:41:58,893 --> 00:42:00,770
Please.

367
00:42:04,941 --> 00:42:07,026
Hold on.
