1
00:00:38,957 --> 00:00:42,336
Holy Ghost, come to me. Praise God.

2
00:00:42,419 --> 00:00:45,422
Praise God. Move up on me, Holy Ghost.

3
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:48,800
Praise God.

4
00:00:49,009 --> 00:00:51,470
This here sinner repents.

5
00:00:51,553 --> 00:00:56,600
Holy Ghost, move up on me. Protect me
and mine with your quickening power.

6
00:01:10,906 --> 00:01:13,158
(rattling)

7
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:20,791
Holy Ghost, come to me.

8
00:01:48,026 --> 00:01:50,070
(rattling)

9
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:19,766
Help me, Jesus!

10
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,395
Help me, Jesus! Help me, Jesus!

11
00:03:13,904 --> 00:03:16,406
(Mulder) Not as far as you know.

12
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:20,577
Right. Not this time of year.

13
00:03:22,746 --> 00:03:25,874
All right. Thank you, Doctor. Goodbye.

14
00:03:28,794 --> 00:03:30,629
Snakes.

15
00:03:30,712 --> 00:03:35,300
Lots and lots of snakes.
Very pissed off ones, from the look of it.

16
00:03:38,512 --> 00:03:42,224
It's the former Mr Jared Chirp,
of McMinn County, Tennessee.

17
00:03:42,307 --> 00:03:46,061
- Oh, my God.
- 116 separate bite marks.

18
00:03:46,144 --> 00:03:51,483
Judging from the wounds, there were 50
snakes involved - copperheads and rattlers.

19
00:03:51,608 --> 00:03:53,985
It says here he was found dead in his car.

20
00:03:54,111 --> 00:04:00,117
With a pistol in his hand. He fired six shots,
into the floorboards, even into his kneecap.

21
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,913
- The windows were shut, the doors locked.
- But what happened to all the snakes?

22
00:04:05,372 --> 00:04:09,418
No one seems to know that.
There was not a scale found.

23
00:04:09,501 --> 00:04:13,463
I just got off the phone with a herpetologist,
and he's stumped.

24
00:04:13,547 --> 00:04:17,050
Especially because rattlesnakes
tend to hibernate in winter.

25
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:21,096
So you think that Mr Chirp was murdered?

26
00:04:21,179 --> 00:04:24,391
It would appear that way,
but the question is, how?

27
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:28,019
There's no physical evidence.
No tyre tracks, no footprints.

28
00:04:28,103 --> 00:04:31,398
I can't see how anyone
could have done this. And then, why?

29
00:04:31,481 --> 00:04:34,192
Why use poisonous snakes
as a murder weapon?

30
00:04:34,276 --> 00:04:38,697
Maybe it's symbolic. I mean, serpents
and religion have gone hand in hand.

31
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:42,075
They've represented
the temptation of Eve, original sin.

32
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:44,619
They've been feared throughout history,

33
00:04:44,703 --> 00:04:49,124
as they've been thought to embody Satan,
to serve evil itself.

34
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:52,169
Maybe these ones actually do.

35
00:04:52,252 --> 00:04:55,672
These particular serpents
actually were serving evil?

36
00:04:57,257 --> 00:04:59,801
Are you gonna type that
on our travel request?

37
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:04,806
No. But, at the very least, this case
does seem to centre around religion.

38
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,518
And you're not the only one
to think that, by the way.

39
00:05:27,245 --> 00:05:30,749
Jared is in a better place now, Gracie.

40
00:05:30,874 --> 00:05:32,918
He's at peace.

41
00:05:44,387 --> 00:05:49,434
You know Reverend Mac:key's right, honey.
He is in a better place.

42
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:03,114
Reverend Samuel Mackey?

43
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:09,454
My name is Fox Mulder. This is Dana Scully.
We're with the FBI. May we speak with you?

44
00:06:10,539 --> 00:06:13,500
Come on, Gracie. Let's get you home.

45
00:06:18,797 --> 00:06:23,885
We apologise for our timing. We'd like
to ask a few questions about Jared Chirp.

46
00:06:23,969 --> 00:06:26,888
I've already spoken to the sheriff about it.

47
00:06:26,972 --> 00:06:30,934
Though I'm not sure that was a good idea.

48
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:35,605
Specifically, you had suspicions
about the manner in which he died?

49
00:06:37,482 --> 00:06:41,444
I should be the last one to point a finger
or say a harsh word.

50
00:06:41,528 --> 00:06:46,491
Our church is founded on acceptance
and tolerance of all people, all beliefs.

51
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:49,744
But?

52
00:06:49,828 --> 00:06:54,541
Before Jared joined us, he belonged to a
fundamentalist congregation outside of town,

53
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:59,254
the Church of God with Signs & Wonders.
It practises snake handling.

54
00:06:59,337 --> 00:07:03,800
As a sign of faith, worshippers
handle deadly snakes and drink poison.

55
00:07:03,883 --> 00:07:08,513
They believe that the Holy Spirit
protects the righteous.

56
00:07:08,972 --> 00:07:10,807
Jared grew up in that church,

57
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:15,812
but it is very difficult to walk away
from a belief system that one is raised in.

58
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:19,858
- It takes great courage.
- Why did he walk away?

59
00:07:20,525 --> 00:07:23,653
He and Gracie, his girlfriend, left it together.

60
00:07:23,737 --> 00:07:29,326
They found that a rigid interpretation
of the Bible was not for them.

61
00:07:29,409 --> 00:07:33,622
Especially when it involves risking
life and limb in the act of worship.

62
00:07:33,705 --> 00:07:36,833
But again, it is not for me to judge.

63
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:41,504
I will say, however,
that both Jared and Gracie

64
00:07:41,713 --> 00:07:45,216
were persecuted by
the members of their former church.

65
00:07:47,302 --> 00:07:52,974
All this animus stems from
their church leader, Enoch O'Connor.

66
00:07:53,224 --> 00:07:55,560
Animus enough to motivate a murder?

67
00:08:23,129 --> 00:08:27,300
Snake handling -
didn't learn that in catechism class.

68
00:08:27,384 --> 00:08:32,389
That's funny. I knew a couple of Catholic
schoolgirls who were expert at it.

69
00:08:39,646 --> 00:08:42,774
Enoch O'Connor? Federal agents.

70
00:08:49,614 --> 00:08:54,160
- Where's the light switch?
- The nearest one? Probably ten miles away.

71
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:20,895
Rattlesnakes and
medieval visions of damnation.

72
00:09:20,979 --> 00:09:23,565
I, for one, feel a whole lot closer to God.

73
00:09:23,648 --> 00:09:26,484
I don't know, Scully.
When you get right down to it,

74
00:09:26,568 --> 00:09:32,782
is snake handling any harder to buy into than
communion wafers or transubstantiation?

75
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:35,160
Or believing in flying saucers.

76
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:41,332
I'm just saying that your faith and O'Connor's
seem to be based on the same book.

77
00:09:53,678 --> 00:09:56,848
Uh-oh, Scully. What do you think
O'Connor keeps in here?

78
00:09:57,557 --> 00:09:59,976
Something slithery?

79
00:10:03,813 --> 00:10:07,484
- It's all right. It's empty.
- Why is it empty?

80
00:10:08,359 --> 00:10:10,403
(rattling)

81
00:10:22,373 --> 00:10:23,792
(door opens)

82
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:34,010
By what right are you here?

83
00:10:35,553 --> 00:10:38,973
Reverend Enoch O'Connor?
We're federal agents.

84
00:10:39,057 --> 00:10:41,476
We're, uh... with the FBI.

85
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:45,230
Reverend, do something
about these snakes, please.

86
00:10:45,355 --> 00:10:48,942
You got nothing to fear
if you're righteous people.

87
00:10:49,025 --> 00:10:53,196
Just in case we're not,
we could use a little righteous help here.

88
00:10:57,492 --> 00:10:59,035
What do you want?

89
00:10:59,118 --> 00:11:04,165
We're here to ask you questions about a
former member of your church, Jared Chirp.

90
00:11:04,249 --> 00:11:08,628
That boy strayed from the path
and was lost to the Dark One.

91
00:11:08,753 --> 00:11:12,632
I'm sorry for his soul.
There ain't much else to say.

92
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:18,096
He died from snakebites. We thought
maybe you'd have a special insight into that.

93
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:21,057
I do.

94
00:11:23,101 --> 00:11:27,480
- It was a test.
- A test? What do you mean?

95
00:11:27,564 --> 00:11:30,358
A test of faith.

96
00:11:30,441 --> 00:11:32,610
A test of righteousness.

97
00:11:34,571 --> 00:11:38,950
When the Devil aims to test you,
you best be ready.

98
00:11:39,033 --> 00:11:42,328
And you sure better know
which side you're on.

99
00:11:42,579 --> 00:11:45,915
Are you speaking about
the Devil's test or your test?

100
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:50,211
I don't think you people
realise which side you're on.

101
00:11:52,589 --> 00:11:54,465
I do.

102
00:11:55,633 --> 00:11:57,802
You can leave now.

103
00:12:09,147 --> 00:12:11,482
Tennessee. Snakes.

104
00:12:11,566 --> 00:12:17,238
Thank you, Mulder. Thank you so much. I say
we arrest him and catch the first flight out.

105
00:12:17,322 --> 00:12:21,242
He seems a likely suspect,
only the sheriff's office ruled him out.

106
00:12:21,326 --> 00:12:23,786
He was in Kentucky
the night Jared Chirp died.

107
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,664
There are other people in his congregation.

108
00:12:26,748 --> 00:12:29,584
Chirp died with a packed suitcase by his side.

109
00:12:29,667 --> 00:12:33,671
There's gotta be somebody
that knows where he was headed.

110
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:55,026
Here you go, honey.

111
00:13:07,622 --> 00:13:12,502
Reverend Mackey? This might not be
the best time, but can I speak to you?

112
00:13:12,585 --> 00:13:14,087
Of course.

113
00:13:14,337 --> 00:13:17,465
Jared called the boarding house
late the night he died.

114
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:21,094
He wanted to talk to Gracie.
I didn't let him.

115
00:13:22,095 --> 00:13:26,849
It was after two. She was sound asleep.
It sounded like the boy had been drinkin'.

116
00:13:26,933 --> 00:13:32,105
He wasn't makin' any sense. He was rantin'
about seein' the Devil, and payin' for his sins.

117
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,774
Iris, why didn't you tell the police?

118
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:37,068
I don't know how to tell Gracie.

119
00:13:37,318 --> 00:13:41,698
I kept her from speakin' to Jared
his last night on Earth.

120
00:13:42,198 --> 00:13:44,659
I couldn't have known, though. I couldn't.

121
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:50,039
No, no. You couldn't have known.
I can help you talk to Gracie.

122
00:13:50,123 --> 00:13:52,709
Reverend Mackey? Everybody's here.

123
00:13:52,917 --> 00:13:55,044
Thank you, Gracie.

124
00:13:56,421 --> 00:14:00,299
You and I will see this through, Iris,
right after study group.

125
00:14:00,383 --> 00:14:02,468
Thank you.

126
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:06,014
(clapping)

127
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,936
(Enoch) Our God is a fearsome God.

128
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:16,649
- (man) Amen!
- (Enoch) He demands our very lives.

129
00:14:20,111 --> 00:14:25,700
Revelations, three. The sixteenth verse.

130
00:14:25,783 --> 00:14:31,873
'Tis better to be hot or cold than lukewarm.

131
00:14:31,956 --> 00:14:33,791
Hallelujah!

132
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,002
Yes!

133
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:40,381
God says... if you're lukewarm,

134
00:14:40,465 --> 00:14:45,636
He will vomit you out of His mouth.

135
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:49,640
Yes! Did you hear what I said?

136
00:14:49,766 --> 00:14:55,772
Yes! God hates the lukewarm!

137
00:14:56,564 --> 00:14:59,901
"So, because you are lukewarm,

138
00:14:59,984 --> 00:15:04,614
I am about to spit you out of my mouth."

139
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:10,912
Now, that could sound pretty harsh, couldn't
it? I mean, depending on how one reads it.

140
00:15:11,162 --> 00:15:15,249
But if we put this verse
in a historical context,

141
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:21,923
I think we'll see that John was specifically
addressing the problems of the Church...

142
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:25,843
God wants you hot!

143
00:15:26,344 --> 00:15:30,431
God wants you on fire!

144
00:15:31,516 --> 00:15:33,601
Praise to Jesus.

145
00:15:35,895 --> 00:15:41,859
God wants you to put your money
where your mouth is.

146
00:15:41,943 --> 00:15:44,028
- Amen!
- Hallelujah!

147
00:15:47,323 --> 00:15:49,367
(rattling)

148
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:57,208
People ask me why I handle snakes.

149
00:15:57,708 --> 00:15:59,418
Hallelujah!

150
00:15:59,502 --> 00:16:03,631
I tell 'em. It's cos the Scripture tells me to.

151
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:05,967
Praise God!

152
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:15,143
(Reverend Mackey
lectures in the background)

153
00:16:19,564 --> 00:16:21,440
Hallelujah.

154
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:26,237
Hallelujah!

155
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:31,409
Hallelujah!

156
00:16:52,972 --> 00:16:55,933
(congregation sings a hymn)

157
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:21,876
Witness the power!

158
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:26,130
Witness the awesome power of God

159
00:17:26,214 --> 00:17:33,346
as He blesses His people
and destroys His enemies.

160
00:17:34,305 --> 00:17:36,891
Thank you, God!

161
00:18:07,797 --> 00:18:09,548
(hissing)

162
00:18:26,691 --> 00:18:31,070
I don't understand it. None of us
saw or heard anything. Just her scream.

163
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:34,073
When we ran in she was lying on the floor.

164
00:18:34,865 --> 00:18:39,328
I cleared everybody out of the building
once I saw the bite marks, but...

165
00:18:39,412 --> 00:18:42,748
Reverend, how close
was Iris to Jared Chirp?

166
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:47,461
Not particularly close, but I'd spoken
with her not 15 minutes earlier about him.

167
00:18:47,545 --> 00:18:51,090
- What'd you talk about?
- She was upset.

168
00:18:51,549 --> 00:18:55,469
Something about Jared calling her
the night he died, looking for Gracie.

169
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,890
Something about him paying for his sins.

170
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:04,312
But I don't know. We didn't get
to finish our conversation.

171
00:19:04,395 --> 00:19:07,732
Maybe that was the point.

172
00:19:14,196 --> 00:19:17,450
Why Iris? Why is this happening?

173
00:19:24,165 --> 00:19:28,961
Gracie, we're investigating the leader
of your former church, Enoch O'Connor.

174
00:19:29,045 --> 00:19:33,549
We believe that he may have had something
to do with what happened here tonight.

175
00:19:36,135 --> 00:19:39,013
We would appreciate
anything you could tell us.

176
00:19:39,096 --> 00:19:41,974
No, he didn't do this.

177
00:19:42,058 --> 00:19:47,438
No, he didn't do this.
This is Satan's work, not man's.

178
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:53,903
That sounds like something that
Reverend O'Connor might say.

179
00:19:53,986 --> 00:19:57,448
Now, you're not a member
of that congregation any more.

180
00:19:57,531 --> 00:20:01,911
And I understand that's because
you're someone who thinks for herself.

181
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:06,874
Keeping an open mind, is it conceivable
that O'Connor could have done any of this?

182
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:11,337
No! Don't you think I would know?
Me of all people.

183
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:14,757
He couldn't have done this. He just...

184
00:20:18,761 --> 00:20:21,764
(Mackey) Gracie might be biased.

185
00:20:21,847 --> 00:20:24,725
O'Connor is your father.

186
00:20:31,816 --> 00:20:34,527
When Gracie got pregnant...

187
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:39,323
O'Connor barred her from his church.
She and Jared Chirp.

188
00:20:40,324 --> 00:20:42,827
His church and his home.

189
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:02,721
- You 00min'?
- I think I'll check around back.

190
00:21:18,946 --> 00:21:22,867
"Pray for the souls... lost to us."

191
00:22:35,064 --> 00:22:36,941
(rattling)

192
00:22:54,041 --> 00:22:56,877
You must be judged.

193
00:23:05,261 --> 00:23:07,304
Repent.

194
00:23:07,388 --> 00:23:10,891
Pray for the Lord's quickening power.

195
00:23:13,519 --> 00:23:16,021
By the hand of God!

196
00:23:18,857 --> 00:23:21,402
(Mulder) Let her go!

197
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:37,876
Your partner could have learned
something about herself

198
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:43,757
if you hadn't have stopped me.
Some powerful good news maybe.

199
00:23:43,841 --> 00:23:47,595
I'd say it's good news for you
that she's not here right now,

200
00:23:47,678 --> 00:23:50,514
considering what you tried to do to her.

201
00:23:51,849 --> 00:23:54,768
Is that what you did to your wife?

202
00:23:57,521 --> 00:23:59,732
Alice O'Connor.

203
00:23:59,815 --> 00:24:04,153
Succumbed to multiple snakebites
in June 1994.

204
00:24:05,237 --> 00:24:10,618
It happened during a church service.
Or at least that's what you told local police.

205
00:24:13,203 --> 00:24:15,414
You got away with it.

206
00:24:15,497 --> 00:24:17,374
Almost.

207
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:25,090
What was the problem with your wife?
Was she not... righteous enough for you?

208
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:31,889
Just like your daughter's boyfriend?
Or Iris Finster?

209
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:37,353
Educated man. Too smart to know any better.

210
00:24:37,936 --> 00:24:40,314
Smart enough to know you're a murderer.

211
00:24:40,397 --> 00:24:44,318
Satan is near and you don't even have eyes.

212
00:24:44,401 --> 00:24:46,695
You're just proud and fancy-free.

213
00:24:47,029 --> 00:24:50,199
Ah, no one quite
passes muster with you, huh?

214
00:24:51,575 --> 00:24:55,079
You feel the need to exact
some kind of Old Testament revenge?

215
00:24:56,872 --> 00:25:01,251
What about your daughter?
What were your plans for her?

216
00:25:03,629 --> 00:25:06,757
I pray for her soul.

217
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,927
I pray and I pray, because she's lost.

218
00:25:10,010 --> 00:25:12,471
Because she no longer believes as you do?

219
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:17,976
You think, because you're educated,
you're better than most? You ain't.

220
00:25:19,937 --> 00:25:22,356
Unless you're smart down here,

221
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:27,277
the Devil's gonna make a fool of you
and you ain't even gonna know it.

222
00:25:36,745 --> 00:25:39,790
I changed my mind. I don't wanna see him.

223
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:46,839
Besides, I won't do any better
than you people in gettin' him to talk.

224
00:25:49,466 --> 00:25:51,510
Gracie?

225
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:55,639
You still don't believe your father did it?

226
00:25:56,557 --> 00:25:59,226
It don't matter what I believe.

227
00:25:59,977 --> 00:26:03,105
He'll be judged as he deserves.

228
00:26:03,188 --> 00:26:05,816
Can't nobody avoid it.

229
00:26:53,864 --> 00:26:55,949
(rattling)

230
00:26:57,367 --> 00:26:59,453
(Enoch prays)

231
00:27:45,415 --> 00:27:46,792
(door opens)

232
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:56,677
Deputy found him about an hour ago.

233
00:27:56,969 --> 00:28:00,013
There's no telling when he was attacked.

234
00:28:00,097 --> 00:28:03,892
I guess it's looking
less and less like he's a suspect.

235
00:28:03,976 --> 00:28:09,481
Unless he somehow managed to do this to
himself. As a test of his own righteousness.

236
00:28:09,565 --> 00:28:12,150
If so, Mulder, the jury's still out.

237
00:28:12,234 --> 00:28:15,863
I spoke to his doctor.
It's a toss-up as to whether he'll pull through.

238
00:28:15,946 --> 00:28:18,490
- Anti-venom treatment?
- He's not receiving it.

239
00:28:18,574 --> 00:28:20,701
- Why not?
- Gracie stepped in.

240
00:28:20,784 --> 00:28:25,163
She's forbidding treatment on religious
grounds. It's not clear whether she can,

241
00:28:25,247 --> 00:28:30,043
but she says that it's up to God
as to whether he lives or dies.

242
00:28:30,127 --> 00:28:35,674
And you think that she may not be entirely
motivated by concern for her father's soul?

243
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:38,510
Well, more to the point,
what if she did this?

244
00:28:39,678 --> 00:28:44,141
She told me that her father
would be judged as he deserves.

245
00:28:44,391 --> 00:28:47,311
- This is what she meant?
- She grew up around snakes.

246
00:28:47,561 --> 00:28:51,481
Who's to say she isn't every bit as adept
at handling them as he is?

247
00:28:51,732 --> 00:28:57,654
I can see her being angry enough at her father
to attack him, but... what about the others?

248
00:29:08,874 --> 00:29:13,337
He left in a hurry.
He packed one suitcase and a gun.

249
00:29:13,503 --> 00:29:16,089
Earlier that night, he calls Gracie.

250
00:29:16,173 --> 00:29:20,302
Gets Iris instead.
Starts rambling about paying for his sins.

251
00:29:20,385 --> 00:29:25,223
He's frightened and wants to leave town,
presumably with Gracie.

252
00:29:25,307 --> 00:29:27,726
So what's he scared of?

253
00:29:30,854 --> 00:29:35,859
I don't understand how O'Connor's church
exerts a strong pull on these people.

254
00:29:35,943 --> 00:29:41,406
It's not so hard to understand. It's a culture
with a very well-defined set of rules.

255
00:29:41,698 --> 00:29:43,742
It's an intolerant culture.

256
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:47,329
I don't know. Sometimes a little intolerance
can be a welcome thing.

257
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:50,832
Clear-cut right and wrong,
black and white, no shades of grey.

258
00:29:51,041 --> 00:29:55,796
In a society where rules are harder to come
by, some people would appreciate that.

259
00:29:55,879 --> 00:29:59,967
You're saying that you would welcome
someone telling you what to believe?

260
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:04,262
I'm just saying that somebody
offering you all the answers...

261
00:30:04,346 --> 00:30:06,932
can be a very powerful thing.

262
00:30:16,191 --> 00:30:18,276
It's lab results.

263
00:30:19,861 --> 00:30:24,658
Am I reading this right? Did Jared Chirp
have himself tested for sterility?

264
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:27,869
Which turns out to be more or less the case.

265
00:30:29,246 --> 00:30:34,584
Based on this, that means that Jared
can't be the father of Gracie's baby.

266
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:36,461
Dated the day he died.

267
00:30:36,545 --> 00:30:40,590
So maybe he was killed
because he discovered the truth.

268
00:30:43,176 --> 00:30:45,679
(medical monitor beeps steadily)

269
00:30:55,689 --> 00:31:00,235
Gracie... I'd like to ask you to reconsider.

270
00:31:00,318 --> 00:31:02,612
No. This is what he'd want.

271
00:31:02,696 --> 00:31:05,866
He may die without medical treatment.

272
00:31:06,116 --> 00:31:08,410
I've seen him bit a dozen times.

273
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:12,706
He always said that it was up to God
whether he lives or dies.

274
00:31:12,789 --> 00:31:16,293
He said it was a worse sin not to trust God.

275
00:31:16,543 --> 00:31:20,047
There are many ways to trust God, Gracie.

276
00:31:20,130 --> 00:31:24,301
One of them is to trust
to the miracles of doctors and medicine.

277
00:31:26,136 --> 00:31:32,476
Or, in your heart...
do you really not want him to get better?

278
00:31:33,977 --> 00:31:36,605
It ain't for me.

279
00:31:39,649 --> 00:31:42,027
I can't risk his soul.

280
00:31:44,905 --> 00:31:50,327
When you first came to me, you said
that you wanted to think for yourself.

281
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:56,833
To live your life as you saw fit.

282
00:31:58,293 --> 00:32:01,713
If you stand here and let your father die,

283
00:32:01,797 --> 00:32:04,216
whose beliefs are you living?

284
00:32:04,758 --> 00:32:07,219
Yours?

285
00:32:07,302 --> 00:32:09,179
Or his?

286
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:25,987
You're doing the right thing.

287
00:32:26,071 --> 00:32:29,533
I'll go tell the doctor, OK?

288
00:32:38,291 --> 00:32:41,086
(beeping quickens)

289
00:33:00,856 --> 00:33:03,275
Agents! Enoch O'Connor is gone.

290
00:33:03,358 --> 00:33:07,654
I was away for five minutes.
His bed's empty. Gracie is gone, too.

291
00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:10,490
How could Gracie
have possibly gotten him out?

292
00:33:10,574 --> 00:33:14,035
- Maybe he took her.
- He was on his deathbed. That's impossible.

293
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:18,290
- Besides, what's his motivation?
- I may be able to answer that.

294
00:33:20,125 --> 00:33:23,920
Jared Chirp wasn't the father of Gracie's child.

295
00:33:24,004 --> 00:33:26,590
We know that. What about it?

296
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:33,263
Enoch O'Connor is.

297
00:33:35,473 --> 00:33:41,021
That's why she wanted to get away from
him and his church as fast as she could.

298
00:33:41,104 --> 00:33:45,025
And I tried to teach her to forgive him.

299
00:33:48,028 --> 00:33:50,113
Daddy, please!

300
00:33:56,578 --> 00:33:59,164
I'm bringing you home.

301
00:34:04,836 --> 00:34:07,631
Somebody help me!

302
00:34:12,093 --> 00:34:16,681
In the name of our holy
and most fearsome God.

303
00:34:16,973 --> 00:34:19,142
(all) Hallelujah!

304
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:23,188
Resist the Devil and he will flee.

305
00:34:23,271 --> 00:34:25,357
Resist him!

306
00:34:25,941 --> 00:34:29,819
Something's wrong.
Something's wrong with my baby.

307
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:42,582
Jesus, put your hands on this one.
You can heal her.

308
00:34:44,292 --> 00:34:47,337
Yes, Jesus. Yes, dear Jesus.

309
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:54,135
Jesus, dear Lord.
Dear Jesus, deliver this woman.

310
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:57,347
Oh, my God. Jesus. Jesus.

311
00:35:01,851 --> 00:35:04,229
No. Don't. Don't!

312
00:35:04,312 --> 00:35:09,067
Dear God, dear Heavenly Father,
deliver this woman.

313
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:12,279
- No.
- Lay your hands on this woman, God.

314
00:35:12,362 --> 00:35:14,656
- Yes.
- No.

315
00:35:14,739 --> 00:35:16,491
No!DoNfl

316
00:35:16,574 --> 00:35:18,868
Hallelujah, praise the Lord.

317
00:35:25,250 --> 00:35:27,377
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

318
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:30,505
Dear Jesus. Dear Jesus.

319
00:35:30,588 --> 00:35:33,717
Holy Jesus! Hallelujah!

320
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,012
Dear Jesus! Hallelujah!

321
00:35:37,220 --> 00:35:38,888
Hallelujah!

322
00:36:12,756 --> 00:36:16,259
- How is she?
- Deep shock. Some loss of blood.

323
00:36:18,636 --> 00:36:22,182
What happened here? Where's the baby?

324
00:36:22,265 --> 00:36:26,019
- These folks aren't talkin'.
- (Mulder) Scully?

325
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:29,481
Take a look at this.

326
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:35,111
Snakes.

327
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,950
She gave birth to snakes?

328
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:46,331
The Devil has been cast out.

329
00:36:46,414 --> 00:36:50,210
- Stay with her.
- Where are you going?

330
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:53,838
Find her father.
He's gonna wanna tie up some loose ends.

331
00:37:16,111 --> 00:37:19,739
You stole what was most precious to me.

332
00:37:20,782 --> 00:37:22,951
Gracie?

333
00:37:23,034 --> 00:37:26,621
- She came to me on her own.
- (silent prayer)

334
00:37:26,704 --> 00:37:31,960
She wanted to escape a life of fear
and judgment, of intolerance.

335
00:37:34,337 --> 00:37:37,382
She fled a harsh and vengeful god.

336
00:37:39,134 --> 00:37:41,219
And you.

337
00:37:49,811 --> 00:37:52,313
Drop the knife!

338
00:38:04,534 --> 00:38:06,661
You all right?

339
00:38:12,375 --> 00:38:15,128
Daddy? Daddy?

340
00:38:15,211 --> 00:38:19,591
Gracie, it's Agent Scully. We're taking
you to the doctor right now, OK?

341
00:38:19,674 --> 00:38:23,845
- No. I gotta...
- Can you tell me what happened, Gracie?

342
00:38:28,558 --> 00:38:33,229
- Where's my daddy?
- You're safe. My partner's gone after him.

343
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:36,983
You're gonna be OK.
He can't hurt you any more.

344
00:38:37,066 --> 00:38:39,027
You don't understand.

345
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,112
He saved me.

346
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:52,540
I'll call for an ambulance.

347
00:38:53,875 --> 00:38:56,628
Relax. Help's on the way.

348
00:38:56,711 --> 00:39:00,381
No, it's not. I told you, boy.

349
00:39:00,465 --> 00:39:03,593
You still don't know which side you're on.

350
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:07,639
Be smart, down here.

351
00:39:13,603 --> 00:39:15,855
Yes. Please hurry.

352
00:39:15,939 --> 00:39:18,566
They're on their way.

353
00:39:22,487 --> 00:39:25,657
- Agent!
- It wasn't O'Connor.

354
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:28,451
It was you. You killed Jared Chirp.

355
00:39:28,952 --> 00:39:32,914
- Are you joking?
- No. I'm just beginning to see it now.

356
00:39:32,997 --> 00:39:37,168
Jared must have come to understand
that he wasn't the father of Gracie's baby.

357
00:39:37,252 --> 00:39:39,212
That you were.

358
00:39:39,295 --> 00:39:43,550
Did he confront you earlier that night,
only to see you for who you really are?

359
00:39:43,633 --> 00:39:46,094
Just who is it you think I am?

360
00:39:46,177 --> 00:39:48,888
Is that what happened with Iris Finster?

361
00:39:49,138 --> 00:39:52,475
Was she beginning to catch on?
Is that why you killed her?

362
00:39:52,559 --> 00:39:55,395
Or was it just to further frame
Enoch O'Connor?

363
00:39:55,478 --> 00:39:59,816
Is that what this is really about?
Ruining O'Connor? Seducing his daughter?

364
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:03,319
Destroying him by any conceivable means?

365
00:40:08,491 --> 00:40:11,578
Are you a righteous man, Agent Mulder?

366
00:40:11,661 --> 00:40:14,747
Stay where you are.

367
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:17,625
It's just a simple question.

368
00:40:17,709 --> 00:40:23,548
Most people believe they're
on the side of angels. But are they?

369
00:40:27,218 --> 00:40:31,889
If you were put to the test...
how would you do?

370
00:40:31,973 --> 00:40:34,058
(rattling)

371
00:41:00,376 --> 00:41:02,503
Where's Mulder?

372
00:41:02,587 --> 00:41:04,547
(Mulder) Help!

373
00:41:05,882 --> 00:41:10,053
You can't help him. This is his alone.

374
00:41:14,724 --> 00:41:16,225
(Scully) Mulder?

375
00:41:30,573 --> 00:41:32,325
Argh!

376
00:41:40,083 --> 00:41:41,751
(rattling)

377
00:42:03,356 --> 00:42:06,484
- Mackey?
- Still no trace.

378
00:42:07,318 --> 00:42:11,364
Even though every law enforcement agency
in Tennessee is lookin' for him.

379
00:42:11,447 --> 00:42:13,783
They won't find him.

380
00:42:14,075 --> 00:42:17,578
People think the Devil has horns and a tail.

381
00:42:17,662 --> 00:42:20,873
They're not used to lookin'
for some kindly man.

382
00:42:20,957 --> 00:42:24,794
He's just a man, Mulder. Just like O'Connor.

383
00:42:24,877 --> 00:42:27,213
Not like O'Connor.

384
00:42:27,296 --> 00:42:30,883
If this was some kind of test,
looks like I failed.

385
00:42:30,967 --> 00:42:34,011
I'd say if it was,
you passed with flying colours.

386
00:42:35,221 --> 00:42:38,641
- You're alive, aren't you?
- Proud and fancy-free.

387
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:49,902
Reverend Wells, it's a real joy
to have a man in the pulpit

388
00:42:49,986 --> 00:42:53,156
who has such an open and
modern way of looking at God.

389
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:55,491
Bless you for saying so.

390
00:42:55,783 --> 00:42:59,036
I won't keep you.
I just wanted to welcome you to Hamden.

391
00:42:59,120 --> 00:43:02,373
Thank you.
I look forward to seeing you on Sunday.

392
00:43:02,457 --> 00:43:04,500
Thank you.

393
00:44:14,403 --> 00:44:15,738

394
00:44:34,423 --> 00:44:36,050
(Child) I made this!
