1
00:00:25,861 --> 00:00:28,071
Mr Maleeni.

2
00:00:28,155 --> 00:00:30,532
Hey, guy. You ready to rumble?

3
00:00:30,616 --> 00:00:34,369
If by "rumble" you mean "perform",
yes, I am.

4
00:00:34,453 --> 00:00:38,207
Cool. You know how they said
you get $125 for the day?

5
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:43,712
It's gonna be 75 instead. The gate's for crap.
But the show's got to go on, right?

6
00:00:43,795 --> 00:00:46,131
This will be my greatest show ever.

7
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:48,634
Right on.

8
00:00:48,717 --> 00:00:52,012
(applause)

9
00:00:52,137 --> 00:00:55,557
Ladies and gentlemen, damas y caballeros,

10
00:00:55,641 --> 00:00:59,895
I aim today not just to entertain,
but to educate,

11
00:00:59,978 --> 00:01:02,147
to instruct and inform

12
00:01:02,231 --> 00:01:07,486
in the venerable
and ancient history of my art.

13
00:01:07,611 --> 00:01:12,824
Until Johann Nepomuk Hofsinzer called
playing cards "the poetry of magic",

14
00:01:13,325 --> 00:01:18,997
a conjurer's skill was determined entirely
by his ability to perform one effect.

15
00:01:20,082 --> 00:01:23,293
That effect was known as
"the cups and balls".

16
00:01:23,418 --> 00:01:27,256
The games were known for hundreds,
if not thousands, of years.

17
00:01:27,339 --> 00:01:31,134
Perhaps the greatest performer
was the Italian Bartolomeo Bosco.

18
00:01:31,218 --> 00:01:34,179
Get on with it!

19
00:01:37,849 --> 00:01:41,895
Bosco's passes with the cups and balls.

20
00:01:44,273 --> 00:01:46,358
Vade...

21
00:01:49,194 --> 00:01:51,280
chubio...

22
00:01:54,116 --> 00:01:55,575
celeriter.

23
00:01:55,701 --> 00:02:00,706
Three gone... and yet three return.

24
00:02:01,832 --> 00:02:05,585
Bosco had only one contemporary rival,
a Frenchman named Conus,

25
00:02:05,669 --> 00:02:10,132
who announced in that he would
make his wife, who was five foot seven,

26
00:02:10,215 --> 00:02:12,801
appear under one of the cups.

27
00:02:12,884 --> 00:02:16,888
Practise though I have, I have
been unable even to get married.

28
00:02:16,972 --> 00:02:20,142
Ha“.ha“.ha!

29
00:02:20,892 --> 00:02:23,729
Conus placed one ball in his pocket.

30
00:02:23,854 --> 00:02:26,273
He put the second ball away.

31
00:02:26,356 --> 00:02:29,609
Putting the third ball in his hand,
he made it vanish,

32
00:02:29,693 --> 00:02:35,657
and that's the mystery
of the cups... and the balls.

33
00:02:38,785 --> 00:02:42,789
Yo! Can't you do anything
that ain't a hundred years old?

34
00:02:42,873 --> 00:02:46,335
That ain't old-school, that's decrepit!

35
00:02:46,418 --> 00:02:49,463
Young man, shall I come
heckle you on your job?

36
00:02:49,588 --> 00:02:53,550
Make sure you count out
the requisite number of McNuggets?

37
00:02:53,633 --> 00:02:56,178
Show me something.

38
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:59,598
Come on. Show me something!

39
00:03:02,184 --> 00:03:07,064
A callow challenge to be met
by experience and skill.

40
00:03:07,814 --> 00:03:10,400
To wit, the Egyptian Dedi,

41
00:03:10,484 --> 00:03:16,365
whose most celebrated feat was
to reattach a recently severed head,

42
00:03:16,448 --> 00:03:22,704
reuniting it with a still-warm body,
and no harm done.

43
00:03:22,788 --> 00:03:26,792
Western history knows
three previous attempts

44
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:29,961
at recreating this Noachian feat,

45
00:03:30,837 --> 00:03:34,966
each of the three ending in tragedy.

46
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:38,053
This Will be the fourth.

47
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:41,890
May I have complete silence, please?

48
00:03:57,072 --> 00:04:00,992
Yeah! Signor Maleeni!

49
00:04:01,076 --> 00:04:02,536
Whoo-hoo!

50
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:06,790
(PA) Let's give it up
for the Amazing Maleeni.

51
00:04:12,629 --> 00:04:15,048
Guy, you rock. That kicked ass!

52
00:04:15,132 --> 00:04:18,593
I mean, it looked completely real.
How did you do that?

53
00:04:19,761 --> 00:04:21,847
Oh, yeah, right. Magic.

54
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:26,768
Oh, hey, your money. Hold up.

55
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:34,276
TWO, four, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75.

56
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:36,778
You earned it.

57
00:04:36,862 --> 00:04:38,947
Mr Maleeni?

58
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:43,285
Mr Maleeni.

59
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:47,789
Oh, God... Oh...

60
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:55,315
- Neat trick, huh?
- I can think of a neater one:

61
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:59,444
How you convinced me to get
on the first plane to Los Angeles.

62
00:05:59,528 --> 00:06:01,821
This isn't intriguing enough for you?

63
00:06:01,947 --> 00:06:05,742
A magician turns his head
completely around 360 degrees

64
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:07,869
to the delight of young and old alike,

65
00:06:07,953 --> 00:06:11,289
after which it plops
unceremoniously onto the pier.

66
00:06:11,414 --> 00:06:14,793
- Did you see the picture?
- Yeah, I saw the picture.

67
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:18,463
As for this Amazing Maleeni
turning his head all the way around...

68
00:06:18,588 --> 00:06:21,800
- Like you said, Mulder, neat trick.
- But...?

69
00:06:22,676 --> 00:06:28,348
But I'd guess this event was completely
removed from the subsequent murder.

70
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:30,642
You think this was a murder?

71
00:06:30,767 --> 00:06:34,145
Don't you? Mulder, his head was cut off.

72
00:06:34,229 --> 00:06:37,440
Ah! Observe the nearly complete
absence of blood.

73
00:06:37,524 --> 00:06:39,651
Observe the paucity of fingerprints

74
00:06:39,818 --> 00:06:43,321
as evidenced by the LAPD's
liberal use of lycopodium powder.

75
00:06:43,822 --> 00:06:45,198
You sound like Tony Randall.

76
00:06:45,282 --> 00:06:48,910
Know that Maleeni was alive
one moment and expired the next,

77
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:53,290
also that no one saw his fleeing attacker
nor heard the dying man's cries.

78
00:06:53,373 --> 00:06:59,337
I admit that I don't know how it happened,
but I still say that it was a murder.

79
00:07:00,005 --> 00:07:03,967
- So what's your theory?
- A magic trick gone horribly wrong.

80
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,845
One that claims the lives
of all who attempt it.

81
00:07:06,928 --> 00:07:09,347
Can I see that camcorder again?

82
00:07:10,390 --> 00:07:12,350
Thank you.

83
00:07:12,475 --> 00:07:16,688
A tourist videotaped
Maleeni's performance.

84
00:07:19,107 --> 00:07:21,192
Look at this.

85
00:07:22,444 --> 00:07:25,697
That ain't old school, that's decrepit!

86
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:27,532
Who's the heckler?

87
00:07:27,616 --> 00:07:30,410
Come on. Show me something!

88
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:32,120
I don't know.

89
00:07:41,296 --> 00:07:43,548
(Mulder) Neat trick, huh?

90
00:07:44,591 --> 00:07:47,052
Hang on a second. Let me see this.

91
00:07:50,555 --> 00:07:55,018
That heckler was pretty hard
to impress, wouldn't you say?

92
00:07:55,101 --> 00:07:58,188
Look, and then he just takes off in a huff.

93
00:07:58,271 --> 00:08:01,483
- You think he's a murderer?
- It's worth checking out.

94
00:08:01,566 --> 00:08:05,195
That'll be a neat trick in itself.
You never see his face.

95
00:08:05,278 --> 00:08:07,447
Ah! But observe.

96
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,870
His discarded soda cup.
The hand may be quicker than the eye,

97
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:18,333
- but it still leaves fingerprints.
- Provided they haven't dumped the trash.

98
00:08:18,416 --> 00:08:20,293
Sceptic.

99
00:08:32,806 --> 00:08:34,432
Mr LaBonge?

100
00:08:35,934 --> 00:08:38,687
We're Agents Mulder and Scully
from the FBI.

101
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:44,275
Were you at the Santa Monica Pier
yesterday morning?

102
00:08:45,944 --> 00:08:47,696
Yeah.

103
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:51,616
(Mulder) You attended a magic show.
The Amazing Maleeni.

104
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,326
Yeah, he sucks. Why?

105
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:57,455
He's dead, under extremely
suspicious circumstances.

106
00:08:59,082 --> 00:09:02,919
He still sucks. How'd you find me?

107
00:09:03,002 --> 00:09:07,215
Your fingerprints.
You have a criminal record.

108
00:09:07,298 --> 00:09:10,635
(Mulder) A conviction for pickpocketing.

109
00:09:10,719 --> 00:09:14,264
Man, that was performance art.
Besides, it's ancient history.

110
00:09:14,347 --> 00:09:17,308
What are you saying? You think I killed him?

111
00:09:17,475 --> 00:09:20,019
You're on videotape heckling the deceased.

112
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:23,356
What did you have against Mr Maleeni?

113
00:09:27,527 --> 00:09:31,281
First of all, his name's not Maleeni.

114
00:09:31,364 --> 00:09:36,286
That's the name of a real magician,
a guy at the turn of the century, Max Malini.

115
00:09:36,369 --> 00:09:38,663
- Ever hear of him?
- No.

116
00:09:38,788 --> 00:09:43,543
Too bad. You should have. Anyway,
he steals his name, spells it differently,

117
00:09:43,668 --> 00:09:47,547
and does some tired crap that
wouldn't cut it at a kid's birthday party.

118
00:09:47,672 --> 00:09:51,009
What about when he turns
his head completely around?

119
00:09:51,134 --> 00:09:53,178
Check it out.

120
00:10:25,877 --> 00:10:28,963
No problem. Did you like that?

121
00:10:29,047 --> 00:10:30,381
Yeah.

122
00:10:30,465 --> 00:10:32,300
Watch.

123
00:10:35,053 --> 00:10:37,055
Coin in the hand...

124
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:39,390
blows away.

125
00:10:39,474 --> 00:10:42,936
Maybe it's a little bit hard for you to see.

126
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:47,023
Let me make that... bigger for you.

127
00:10:47,106 --> 00:10:51,736
I don't see how they're any different
or better than the ones Maleeni did.

128
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:54,572
Mozart and Salieri.

129
00:10:54,656 --> 00:10:58,576
They sound pretty much
the same to a layman.

130
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:02,413
But they ain't. You know what I'm saying?

131
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:08,169
It's about originality.

132
00:11:09,254 --> 00:11:10,088
Style.

133
00:11:13,675 --> 00:11:16,177
And more than anything else...

134
00:11:16,261 --> 00:11:18,096
soul.

135
00:11:19,097 --> 00:11:25,019
Because that's what separates
the great ones from the hacks.

136
00:11:27,438 --> 00:11:31,985
We can't do this halfway. We're dealing
with powerful forces at work here.

137
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:36,197
Energies far beyond our mere mortal...

138
00:11:37,782 --> 00:11:40,410
understanding.

139
00:11:40,493 --> 00:11:43,079
Enough to make a magician lose his head?

140
00:11:43,496 --> 00:11:45,707
Could be.

141
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:51,754
That, and I hear Maleeni racked up
some pretty big gambling debts.

142
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:55,717
Who knows who he might've pissed off?

143
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,928
Thank you, Mr LaBonge. We'll be in touch.

144
00:11:59,012 --> 00:12:01,973
Please do. Oh, and Agents?

145
00:12:17,989 --> 00:12:20,408
Mozart and Salieri. Which one's which?

146
00:12:20,491 --> 00:12:24,829
I think that professional jealousy is
as good a motive for murder as any.

147
00:12:24,954 --> 00:12:27,582
If it was a murder. I'm not convinced.

148
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:33,338
If I can get Maleeni into an autopsy bay,
hopefully we can put this issue to rest.

149
00:12:38,176 --> 00:12:41,596
All right, I'm stumped.
And I think I'm supposed to be.

150
00:12:43,014 --> 00:12:44,182
What do you think?

151
00:12:44,307 --> 00:12:46,935
First of all, I'm sorry to disappoint you,

152
00:12:47,018 --> 00:12:51,272
but Mr Maleeni's head
didn't just magically fall off.

153
00:12:51,356 --> 00:12:53,942
It was very carefully sawed.

154
00:12:54,025 --> 00:12:58,696
Very slow and exacting work,
probably with a fine-tooth meat saw.

155
00:12:58,821 --> 00:13:01,491
And check out this little detail...

156
00:13:04,953 --> 00:13:07,497
Spirit gum, Mulder.

157
00:13:08,373 --> 00:13:12,418
It held the head to the body.
Just barely, of course.

158
00:13:12,543 --> 00:13:14,879
- So he was murdered.
- Well, no.

159
00:13:15,004 --> 00:13:18,800
As far as I can tell, this man died
of advanced coronary disease.

160
00:13:18,883 --> 00:13:20,885
- Natural causes.
- Yeah.

161
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:24,681
So he died of a heart attack,
somebody sawed his head off

162
00:13:24,764 --> 00:13:27,475
and then glued it back on, all in 30 seconds.

163
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:30,520
- So does that make sense to you?
- No.

164
00:13:30,603 --> 00:13:32,897
Which makes it even stranger still

165
00:13:32,981 --> 00:13:38,027
because, as far as I can tell, this body
has been dead for over a month.

166
00:13:38,111 --> 00:13:40,905
I see signs of refrigeration.

167
00:13:40,989 --> 00:13:45,076
And yet he performed yesterday.
What a trouper.

168
00:13:45,243 --> 00:13:47,537
Somebody performed yesterday.

169
00:14:13,229 --> 00:14:14,814
Cissy Alvarez.

170
00:14:16,441 --> 00:14:18,693
Who are you?

171
00:14:18,776 --> 00:14:22,113
You don't remember me. Ain't that a bitch?

172
00:14:23,906 --> 00:14:28,327
My name's LaBonge.
I did time with you eight years ago.

173
00:14:28,411 --> 00:14:30,038
You were in for bank robbery.

174
00:14:30,121 --> 00:14:33,458
The name doesn't mean anything.
What do you want?

175
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,209
I hear you're a poker player.

176
00:14:35,293 --> 00:14:38,963
You won big off a guy who calls
himself the Amazing Maleeni.

177
00:14:39,088 --> 00:14:42,216
Also goes by the name
of Herman Pinchbeck.

178
00:14:44,427 --> 00:14:46,304
Pinch beck?

179
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:49,849
- He's dead.
- Yeah, I saw in the paper.

180
00:14:49,932 --> 00:14:53,561
Something about his head fell off.
What's it to you?

181
00:14:55,521 --> 00:14:58,816
I'm the guy that made his head fall off.

182
00:15:01,444 --> 00:15:05,156
You took his marker.
What did he owe you, 15 grand?

183
00:15:05,239 --> 00:15:08,409
- 20.
- He was never gonna pay you back.

184
00:15:08,493 --> 00:15:10,411
You want to cut to the chase?

185
00:15:10,495 --> 00:15:13,956
Get more of your story out
before we stomp you to death?

186
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:17,877
How would you like to get back
what you're owed? Times ten.

187
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,838
$200,000? HOW?

188
00:15:22,048 --> 00:15:24,425
- Helping me.
- Do what?

189
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:26,594
Magic.

190
00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:47,573
Wanna hear more?

191
00:16:14,225 --> 00:16:16,644
Excuse me,
I'm looking for Mr Albert Pinchbeck.

192
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:19,856
He's the gentleman right over there.
The poor man.

193
00:16:27,989 --> 00:16:31,409
- He look familiar to you, Scully?
- He certainly does.

194
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:37,456
- The plot thickens.
- He might try and run.

195
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,669
- (knocks)
- Come in.

196
00:16:43,421 --> 00:16:46,674
- Good morning, Mr and Mrs...?
- Agents...

197
00:16:46,757 --> 00:16:49,010
Mulder and Scully. FBI.

198
00:16:49,093 --> 00:16:52,305
You're not here for a home loan, I take it.

199
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:55,183
No, we are investigating
the death of a magician

200
00:16:55,266 --> 00:16:58,102
who called himself the Amazing Maleeni.

201
00:16:58,186 --> 00:17:00,229
Herman Pinchbeck, my twin brother.

202
00:17:00,313 --> 00:17:03,524
Yes, we know. We checked his next of kin.

203
00:17:03,608 --> 00:17:07,445
- What happened to your neck?
- I was in a car accident.

204
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:09,280
Car accident.

205
00:17:09,363 --> 00:17:14,118
So it has nothing to do with a magic trick
you performed at the Santa Monica Pier?

206
00:17:14,202 --> 00:17:17,163
One which involved you
turning your head 360 degrees?

207
00:17:17,288 --> 00:17:22,251
No. That wasn't me. I was in
a bad car accident in Mexico.

208
00:17:22,335 --> 00:17:26,214
Oh, bad Mexican car accident. In Mexico.

209
00:17:26,339 --> 00:17:28,382
Do you know magic, Mr Pinchbeck?

210
00:17:28,466 --> 00:17:32,720
Yes, I do. Back in the '70s,
my brother and I performed together.

211
00:17:32,803 --> 00:17:35,723
- Why did you stop?
- You never really stop.

212
00:17:43,898 --> 00:17:46,317
(Mulder) Pick a card, any card?

213
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:01,165
(Scully clears throat)

214
00:18:11,342 --> 00:18:14,095
Hm. Very impressive.

215
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:18,891
My brother and I both wanted to do
the best magic the world had ever seen.

216
00:18:19,016 --> 00:18:23,854
The difference was I knew we'd never get
there, but he always believed we would.

217
00:18:23,938 --> 00:18:26,983
We didn't talk much after I quit the act.

218
00:18:27,692 --> 00:18:31,487
I have a theory, Mr Pinchbeck,
and I'm gonna tell you how it goes:

219
00:18:33,406 --> 00:18:37,743
Herman died of heart disease having never
made it as the world's greatest magician,

220
00:18:37,827 --> 00:18:41,789
and that hurts you, just as your
estrangement from him hurts you.

221
00:18:41,872 --> 00:18:45,584
And I think what you did was
perform his last act for him,

222
00:18:45,668 --> 00:18:48,713
one last act for which
he'd always be remembered,

223
00:18:48,879 --> 00:18:51,966
that would end with such a shock,
such a denouement,

224
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:56,220
as would be for ever remembered
in the annals of magic.

225
00:18:57,555 --> 00:18:59,724
That's what I think.

226
00:19:01,726 --> 00:19:04,312
I so wish that were true.

227
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:16,574
It was a very bad car accident in Mexico.

228
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,540
- Oy.
- No kidding.

229
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:29,003
- What now?
- A guy's head falls off.

230
00:19:29,086 --> 00:19:32,298
The greatest trick in the world,
only there's no point to it.

231
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:34,675
What's the reason for doing it?

232
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:39,805
Why do people do magic?
To impress, to delight, to gain attention.

233
00:19:39,889 --> 00:19:43,934
This one's gained mostly police attention.

234
00:19:44,018 --> 00:19:46,270
Maybe that's the point.

235
00:19:47,313 --> 00:19:49,690
Maybe we should consult an expert.

236
00:19:49,774 --> 00:19:54,195
Someone who knows magic, who's
seen the greatest trick in the world.

237
00:19:54,278 --> 00:19:56,364
Maybe he can help us figure that out.

238
00:19:56,489 --> 00:19:58,574
- Mozart.
- Yeah.

239
00:19:58,949 --> 00:20:02,703
What's in it for me?
I mean, let's say I help you out.

240
00:20:02,787 --> 00:20:05,081
What do I get in return?

241
00:20:06,123 --> 00:20:11,128
The feeling of pride that comes
from performing your civic duty.

242
00:20:11,212 --> 00:20:14,048
How about the chance to root through

243
00:20:14,131 --> 00:20:18,260
the professional secrets
of your least favourite magician?

244
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:22,431
Good for a laugh, I guess.

245
00:20:42,576 --> 00:20:44,662
Man, it's worse than I thought.

246
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:52,753
You gotta feed those things, you know.

247
00:20:52,837 --> 00:20:54,255
So...

248
00:20:57,716 --> 00:21:01,011
- Maleeni wasn't murdered?
- It would seem not.

249
00:21:01,095 --> 00:21:05,266
So someone impersonated him
and his crappy act.

250
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:07,476
It's impressive.

251
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:16,944
I'd say the twin did it, but I don't think
he's any better a magician than Maleeni.

252
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:20,781
There's that, and he's got no legs.

253
00:21:23,033 --> 00:21:26,120
Yeah. Whatever.

254
00:21:26,203 --> 00:21:31,167
Anyway, we're looking for a magician
with the same height and build.

255
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:35,171
Good make-up and the right wig,
and no one would know the difference.

256
00:21:35,254 --> 00:21:36,881
Not even you, I guess.

257
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:39,258
I had a couple of Jell-O shots in me.

258
00:21:39,383 --> 00:21:42,803
How did this impersonator
switch out the dead body?

259
00:21:42,887 --> 00:21:44,805
With ease.

260
00:21:44,930 --> 00:21:48,642
You'll kick yourselves when I show
you how he did this, it's so simple.

261
00:21:48,726 --> 00:21:51,228
Because magic is all about...

262
00:21:52,438 --> 00:21:54,732
misdirection.

263
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:59,653
Your impersonator made sure
everyone was looking the other way

264
00:21:59,737 --> 00:22:05,409
when he pulled Maleeni's body from
its secret hiding place underneath...

265
00:22:07,411 --> 00:22:09,079
the floor.

266
00:22:30,809 --> 00:22:34,146
Man... this guy's good.

267
00:22:36,482 --> 00:22:38,943
Well, thanks for your expert opinion.

268
00:22:40,069 --> 00:22:42,863
I guess we're right back where we started.

269
00:22:42,947 --> 00:22:48,285
Maybe not. You said the Amazing Maleeni
had some gambling debts?

270
00:22:48,369 --> 00:22:50,371
Yeah, that's what I heard.

271
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:52,915
Check this out. It looks like a marker.

272
00:22:52,998 --> 00:22:55,209
$20,000. Pinchbeck.

273
00:22:58,963 --> 00:23:02,049
What would this be doing in Maleeni's van?

274
00:23:14,812 --> 00:23:19,817
Thank you, Mr Pinchbeck.
If you could sign here for me.

275
00:23:20,484 --> 00:23:22,570
With pleasure.

276
00:23:24,572 --> 00:23:27,324
Anthony, what kind of gun is that?

277
00:23:27,408 --> 00:23:29,159
Glock 17, nine-millimetre.

278
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:31,829
I've been thinking of maybe buying one.

279
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:34,623
Here, take a look.

280
00:23:39,837 --> 00:23:44,300
Hm. Gosh, it's heavier than
I would have thought.

281
00:23:47,845 --> 00:23:50,556
Thank you, Anthony, Marvin.

282
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:53,559
If you ever want,
I'll take you to the shooting range.

283
00:23:53,684 --> 00:23:56,729
- Have a good one, Mr Pinchbeck.
- You too.

284
00:24:12,161 --> 00:24:14,455
Hello. May I help you?

285
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:22,838
- Damn, you lookjust like him.
- I'm sorry?

286
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:28,427
Your no-good, malapaga brother
died owing me money.

287
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:32,306
A lot of money. You're gonna make good.

288
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:35,726
I'm sorry, but my brother's debts
are his own.

289
00:24:37,728 --> 00:24:42,232
I said, you're gonna make good,

290
00:24:42,358 --> 00:24:45,486
cos me and my friends,
we know where you live.

291
00:25:03,253 --> 00:25:06,298
- Does that sound like the rear diff?
- Pull over.

292
00:25:11,428 --> 00:25:15,099
Stay here and call it in. I'll check it out.

293
00:25:15,182 --> 00:25:19,937
We got a problem with the rear diff
out on Fourth and Main, checkin' it out...

294
00:25:36,787 --> 00:25:38,706
You! In the truck!

295
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:43,085
Get up where I can see you!
Hands where I can see them!

296
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:45,504
Up! Hands up!

297
00:25:45,629 --> 00:25:47,673
All right, get out.

298
00:25:48,132 --> 00:25:49,967
Mister, get out!

299
00:25:52,386 --> 00:25:55,055
I got a guy down back here!

300
00:25:59,685 --> 00:26:02,813
It was a guy with tattoos!
I shot him four times!

301
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:09,111
I don't understand. He was right here.

302
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:29,673
That's your handwriting, is it not?

303
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,971
Mr Alvarez, please answer the question.

304
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:38,974
That ain't mine.
I don't know where you got that.

305
00:26:39,057 --> 00:26:41,268
Yours are the only fingerprints on it.

306
00:26:41,351 --> 00:26:45,522
We ran it through the California
criminal history database,

307
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:48,275
to which you seem to be quite well-known.

308
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:50,652
So it's my marker.

309
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:54,823
So Pinchbeck owed me money.
It was a friendly game of poker.

310
00:26:54,907 --> 00:26:58,494
Very friendly. $20,000 friendly.

311
00:26:58,577 --> 00:27:02,706
- Where did you find that?
- In Herman Pinchbeck's van.

312
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:06,376
Where were you last Thursday?

313
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:10,047
Here. All day. Ask 'em.

314
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:17,095
What is it you think I did to Pinchbeck?

315
00:27:17,179 --> 00:27:21,683
What's in it for me?
If I kill him, he ain't gonna pay me.

316
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:25,229
Why did you play with him?
You knew he was a magician.

317
00:27:25,312 --> 00:27:27,648
I didn't know what he was.

318
00:27:27,731 --> 00:27:30,609
And he sure as hell
couldn't play worth a damn.

319
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:33,654
Don't leave town, Mr Alvarez.

320
00:27:45,082 --> 00:27:48,627
Isn't it odd that the Amazing Maleeni's
a lousy poker player?

321
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:52,756
- He was adept at manipulating cards.
- Maybe he wasn't so adept.

322
00:27:52,881 --> 00:27:56,343
LaBonge certainly doesn't have
a high opinion of his skills.

323
00:27:56,426 --> 00:28:00,973
There's another possibility.
Behold, an ordinary household quarter.

324
00:28:01,098 --> 00:28:04,518
I take the quarter from my right hand
and place it in my left.

325
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:06,311
Where is it?

326
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:08,021
- In your right hand.
- No.

327
00:28:08,605 --> 00:28:10,274
- Ah...
- That's not bad.

328
00:28:10,357 --> 00:28:11,817
Blow your nose.

329
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,735
- Blow your nose.
- Atchoo.

330
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:15,821
- Ta-da. Look at that.
- Amazing!

331
00:28:15,904 --> 00:28:17,990
- The Great Muldeeni.
- What's the point?

332
00:28:18,115 --> 00:28:22,911
It's misdirection, the heart of magic. You
looked one way, the quarter went the other.

333
00:28:22,995 --> 00:28:27,124
- You think that's what's happening?
- We're being led around by our noses.

334
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,461
By whom? Maleeni's already dead.

335
00:28:31,587 --> 00:28:35,632
It appears so, but then, you thought
the quarter was in the right hand.

336
00:28:58,071 --> 00:28:59,573
- 911.
- Hello?

337
00:28:59,656 --> 00:29:03,619
I want to report a man with a gun.
He... he's threatening to kill somebody.

338
00:29:03,702 --> 00:29:08,040
- Can you please speak up?
- No, I can't speak up. I... No, I can't!

339
00:29:08,165 --> 00:29:10,250
Sir?

340
00:29:11,168 --> 00:29:12,669
Hello?

341
00:29:13,712 --> 00:29:14,755
Hello?

342
00:29:16,924 --> 00:29:19,176
Son of a bitch.

343
00:29:25,724 --> 00:29:28,977
Hey, partner. Hey, guys.

344
00:29:29,394 --> 00:29:31,939
- You son of a bitch.
- I'm sorry?

345
00:29:32,022 --> 00:29:34,358
You tried to frame me.

346
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:35,609
- Hijo de tu...
- I didn't!

347
00:29:35,692 --> 00:29:37,235
- You didn't?
- We got a deal!

348
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:39,780
We got no deal. I'm gonna bleed you.

349
00:29:39,863 --> 00:29:41,907
Back off!

350
00:29:46,453 --> 00:29:47,746
You're dead.

351
00:29:53,335 --> 00:29:56,004
Freeze! Drop your weapon!

352
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,468
- Hands behind your head!
- Do it!

353
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:06,181
Bring your head down. Spread your legs.

354
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:19,361
Agents. An unexpected surprise.
Good afternoon.

355
00:30:19,444 --> 00:30:21,405
We'd like to have a word with you.

356
00:30:21,488 --> 00:30:24,658
- I'm fairly busy, actually.
- I'll bet.

357
00:30:24,741 --> 00:30:26,743
- Hey!
- Let's take a little spin.

358
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:40,257
- What's this all about?
- It's about misdirection, Mr Pinchbeck...

359
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:43,427
or should I say the Amazing Maleeni?

360
00:30:43,552 --> 00:30:45,637
Mulder!

361
00:30:47,264 --> 00:30:50,350
It's a trick, Scully. Voilà.

362
00:30:51,101 --> 00:30:53,145
Had you fooled.

363
00:30:53,270 --> 00:30:55,105
You're Maleeni?

364
00:30:55,230 --> 00:30:57,774
Call me Herman.

365
00:31:05,532 --> 00:31:08,994
I was afraid for my life.
That's why I did what I did.

366
00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:11,538
I'm not proud of that.

367
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:15,709
But I owe a lot of money
that I can't possibly pay back.

368
00:31:15,792 --> 00:31:19,629
We know. Gambling debts
to a man named Alvarez.

369
00:31:19,713 --> 00:31:22,174
Yeah, that tattooed psychopath.

370
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:27,095
I've heard terrible stories about him,
things he did in prison to fellow inmates.

371
00:31:27,179 --> 00:31:29,139
So Why'd you play poker with him?

372
00:31:29,306 --> 00:31:32,976
He runs a good game.
I gamble to supplement my income.

373
00:31:33,101 --> 00:31:35,979
God knows, magic barely pays.

374
00:31:36,063 --> 00:31:39,316
Why did you lose? You could
have manipulated the cards.

375
00:31:39,399 --> 00:31:42,986
Cheat? You're asking
why I don't cheat at cards?

376
00:31:43,070 --> 00:31:45,572
Well, you could, right?

377
00:31:45,655 --> 00:31:47,866
Of course I could.

378
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:51,161
But how would I live with myself?

379
00:31:52,162 --> 00:31:54,456
Who raised you?

380
00:31:54,539 --> 00:32:00,337
Well, sir, what does any of this
have to do with your twin brother

381
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:04,132
being found decapitated
at the Santa Monica Pier?

382
00:32:04,216 --> 00:32:08,762
I went to my brother for a loan.
Just my luck, and his.

383
00:32:09,429 --> 00:32:12,182
You found him dead of a heart attack.

384
00:32:12,265 --> 00:32:14,768
His body was still warm.

385
00:32:14,851 --> 00:32:18,355
Looking at him, lifeless, I saw myself,

386
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,233
my own eventual mortality.

387
00:32:21,316 --> 00:32:25,654
I saw all the things I meant
to accomplish but didn't.

388
00:32:25,737 --> 00:32:28,573
It was an opportunity to vanish,
become someone else.

389
00:32:28,698 --> 00:32:32,410
Like I said, I'm not proud of what I did.

390
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:35,205
And so you refrigerated the body...

391
00:32:35,288 --> 00:32:38,250
I needed time to figure out
how to pull it all off.

392
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:43,130
Impersonating my brother, I called the bank,
told them I needed a vacation week.

393
00:32:43,213 --> 00:32:45,590
A trip to Mexico.

394
00:32:45,715 --> 00:32:49,761
Then the bank received word
that I'd been in a terrible accident.

395
00:32:49,886 --> 00:32:53,140
It gave me plenty of time away from work.

396
00:32:53,223 --> 00:32:59,062
And you posed as an amputee to allay
suspicion that you weren't your brother.

397
00:32:59,146 --> 00:33:03,942
That, and I rather enjoyed the sympathy,
especially from the women in our office.

398
00:33:08,738 --> 00:33:14,244
You, uh, still haven't explained why you
left your brother's body at the pier,

399
00:33:14,411 --> 00:33:17,414
or why you arranged
to have his head fall off.

400
00:33:17,497 --> 00:33:21,334
He explained it. He put it so
eloquently when we last spoke.

401
00:33:21,418 --> 00:33:23,753
It was my final performance.

402
00:33:23,837 --> 00:33:27,132
I wanted to go out with
such a shock, such a denouement,

403
00:33:27,257 --> 00:33:31,178
as would for ever be remembered
in the annals of magic.

404
00:33:33,346 --> 00:33:37,267
- That was your last performance.
- What's this for?

405
00:33:38,268 --> 00:33:42,105
Well, I still think you got
a few tricks up your sleeve.

406
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,785
My God.

407
00:33:56,995 --> 00:34:01,291
We gave you handicapped parking.
We built you a ramp.

408
00:34:01,666 --> 00:34:05,587
- Did he have access to the vaults?
- Yes, he has a key to the day gate.

409
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:08,882
- Several of us do.
- What are you looking for?

410
00:34:08,965 --> 00:34:14,638
Any hint at all as to why Maleeni here
is really impersonating his brother.

411
00:34:14,721 --> 00:34:17,933
What about this? Could he
have removed funds electronically?

412
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:21,853
He didn't have security clearance
for electronic fund transfers.

413
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:25,273
Maybe he got around it.
Can we check the withdrawal records?

414
00:34:25,357 --> 00:34:30,028
It would require your badge number and
thumbprint, and probably a subpoena.

415
00:34:30,153 --> 00:34:33,698
We're extra cautious with the EFTs.
You can understand why.

416
00:34:33,823 --> 00:34:38,328
There may be an easier way. If I call up
a transaction list for this terminal...

417
00:34:41,539 --> 00:34:43,959
No. No, everything's in order.

418
00:34:48,129 --> 00:34:51,549
It says here something about
a robbery attempt yesterday.

419
00:34:51,633 --> 00:34:56,346
That wasn't against us, but the
armoured transport service we deal with.

420
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:59,349
No money was taken
and no suspects were caught.

421
00:34:59,474 --> 00:35:03,311
Mr Pinchbeck was the employee
who signed out the truck.

422
00:35:03,395 --> 00:35:04,896
He knew the schedule.

423
00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:09,109
- I had nothing to do with that.
- Maybe, maybe not.

424
00:35:09,192 --> 00:35:13,947
We'll hold you till we find out,
to make sure you don't pull a vanishing act.

425
00:35:19,703 --> 00:35:21,079
Hey.

426
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:33,967
- Paul, I'm putting Mr Pinchbeck in six.
- Right.

427
00:35:36,636 --> 00:35:38,305
(guard) Sleep tight.

428
00:35:38,388 --> 00:35:41,558
Wait, don't I get a phone call, sir? Sir?

429
00:35:41,641 --> 00:35:43,727
(door closes)

430
00:35:44,769 --> 00:35:47,355
("Shave and a Haircut" knock on wall)

431
00:35:54,988 --> 00:35:57,949
- How'd it go?
- Swimmingly.

432
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:01,286
Abracadabra, man.

433
00:36:24,976 --> 00:36:26,436
Oh, damn!

434
00:36:31,775 --> 00:36:34,069
Yes. OK.

435
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:37,405
- All right. All right, thank you.
- Maleeni?

436
00:36:37,489 --> 00:36:41,576
He's still in the city lockup
where he's been since we arrested him.

437
00:36:41,659 --> 00:36:46,664
It certainly doesn't look like he did this.
Lots of fingerprints.

438
00:36:46,748 --> 00:36:49,417
I guarantee you none of them
match our thieves.

439
00:36:49,501 --> 00:36:54,130
They're too clever to leave clues,
except for the ones they want us to find.

440
00:36:54,214 --> 00:36:56,383
Excuse me. May I show you something?

441
00:36:57,634 --> 00:37:00,720
We thought the camera footage
might show the robbers.

442
00:37:00,804 --> 00:37:02,013
- Does it?
- No.

443
00:37:02,138 --> 00:37:06,142
They all mysteriously went blank
from about 3am to 3.20.

444
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:10,105
- That's not what we wanted you to see.
- This is from two days ago.

445
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:17,320
Cissy Alvarez. Convicted bank robber.

446
00:37:17,404 --> 00:37:20,824
- You recognise this man?
- Yeah. Who is he to you?

447
00:37:22,325 --> 00:37:26,913
I know those tattoos.
That's the man who tried to rob my truck.

448
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:30,166
What the hell, man? What did I do?

449
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:33,420
You, FBI, what's up with this?

450
00:37:33,503 --> 00:37:35,964
You can't just bust in here! I got rights.

451
00:37:36,047 --> 00:37:38,800
I'm gonna call my lawyer,
then we'll see what's what.

452
00:37:38,883 --> 00:37:42,595
- Nothing back there.
- This is harassment. This is harassment!

453
00:37:42,679 --> 00:37:46,099
What are they looking for?
Come on, man! Somebody talk to me.

454
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:48,768
<i>'</i> (man) Shut up.
- No, you shut up!

455
00:37:48,893 --> 00:37:52,021
Man, this ain't right.
Why'd you put the cuffs on so tight?

456
00:37:53,314 --> 00:37:56,776
Yo, will you please tell me
what he's looking for?

457
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:08,037
Well... Saving up for a rainy day?

458
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,710
Oh, no, no. We got framed.
This is a frame-up!

459
00:38:13,793 --> 00:38:17,046
- It was the magician.
- The magician? Maleeni?

460
00:38:17,172 --> 00:38:20,049
No, not the dead one, man!
That little cabrén!

461
00:38:20,133 --> 00:38:23,803
LaBonge! LaBonge set me up!
Listen to me...

462
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:27,182
- Billy LaBonge.
- And the Amazing Maleeni.

463
00:38:27,307 --> 00:38:30,435
That's a double bill I wouldn't wanna miss.

464
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:34,397
Pinchbeck, you made your bail.

465
00:38:39,819 --> 00:38:42,071
You too, LaBonge.

466
00:38:45,575 --> 00:38:47,118
(guard) OK.

467
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:50,246
Releasing these two
may be a bit premature.

468
00:38:50,371 --> 00:38:52,999
(Mulder) Give us a minute, will you?

469
00:38:56,336 --> 00:38:58,505
Good morning. Did you sleep well?

470
00:38:58,588 --> 00:39:01,341
Agent Mulder. Agent Scully.

471
00:39:02,091 --> 00:39:06,179
- Bravo. Really.
- What do you mean?

472
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:10,683
Last night the Cradock Marine Bank
was robbed of $1 .8 million.

473
00:39:10,767 --> 00:39:15,188
This morning that amount was found
in the possession of Mr Cissy Alvarez.

474
00:39:15,271 --> 00:39:19,108
Wow. I told you he was bad news.
Bravo to you.

475
00:39:19,651 --> 00:39:22,946
- That was expeditious police work.
- Thank you. It was.

476
00:39:23,029 --> 00:39:25,823
It's only that Alvarez was
so obviously guilty.

477
00:39:25,907 --> 00:39:30,787
A convicted bank robber witnessed trying
to rob an armoured car two days earlier?

478
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:33,039
- He'll need a good lawyer.
- Yeah.

479
00:39:33,164 --> 00:39:35,875
He's up a creek. Just like you two want him.

480
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:38,711
I don't quite see
where you're headed with this.

481
00:39:38,795 --> 00:39:42,382
I have no evidence,
but I have a theory, Mr Maleeni,

482
00:39:42,465 --> 00:39:45,385
and I'll tell you how it goes:

483
00:39:45,468 --> 00:39:48,471
Your twin brother, Albert,
died of a heart attack,

484
00:39:48,596 --> 00:39:51,724
at which point you and your protégé
saw an opportunity.

485
00:39:51,808 --> 00:39:54,477
My protégé? I hate this guy's guts.

486
00:39:55,436 --> 00:39:57,564
That's what you wanted us to think.

487
00:39:57,647 --> 00:40:01,484
You wanted revenge against the man
who made your life in prison hell.

488
00:40:01,568 --> 00:40:04,654
I did time with you about eight years ago.

489
00:40:04,779 --> 00:40:09,409
Alvarez. You and he were
on the same cell block eight years ago.

490
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:13,371
It was a setup. You played poker
with him and made sure you lost big.

491
00:40:13,496 --> 00:40:17,083
It gave LaBonge an in with Alvarez
once everybody thought you were dead.

492
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:21,254
LaBonge planted Alvarez's marker
in Maleeni's van so we'd find it.

493
00:40:21,337 --> 00:40:24,215
You used Alvarez's greed
in order to ensnare him

494
00:40:24,299 --> 00:40:28,553
and then orchestrated the attempted
bank robbery to implicate him.

495
00:40:28,636 --> 00:40:31,389
That was you in the armoured car,
disguised as Alvarez.

496
00:40:31,514 --> 00:40:35,143
Mr Pinchbeck got ahold of
the guard's gun and switched the clip.

497
00:40:35,226 --> 00:40:37,770
Guard didn't know it,
but he was firing blanks.

498
00:40:37,854 --> 00:40:40,815
Then last night
the two of you robbed the bank,

499
00:40:40,898 --> 00:40:43,526
and planted the money at Alvarez's place.

500
00:40:46,904 --> 00:40:48,698
Don't you think we have pretty good alibis?

501
00:40:48,781 --> 00:40:51,326
You have the best alibis in the world,

502
00:40:51,409 --> 00:40:54,454
which is why you two
got arrested in the first place.

503
00:40:54,537 --> 00:40:58,166
With your expertise
at sleight-of-hand pickpocketing,

504
00:40:58,291 --> 00:41:02,545
I think you were both able to
get out of here by pilfering a guard's key.

505
00:41:02,629 --> 00:41:06,966
You escaped, stole the money, framed
Alvarez and came back for breakfast.

506
00:41:07,050 --> 00:41:09,344
Scrambled eggs and sausage.

507
00:41:09,427 --> 00:41:12,513
That would be the world's
greatest trick, wouldn't it?

508
00:41:12,597 --> 00:41:16,976
One that would be for ever remembered
in the annals of magic.

509
00:41:19,228 --> 00:41:23,107
- What happens to us?
- To you?

510
00:41:23,983 --> 00:41:27,403
You go free... provided the magic is over.

511
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,034
The great ones always know
when to leave the stage.

512
00:41:37,121 --> 00:41:39,749
Billy, let's get the hell outta here.

513
00:41:47,715 --> 00:41:51,803
- They are the world's greatest.
- We saw through their magic.

514
00:41:51,886 --> 00:41:54,138
Nah, there's more.

515
00:41:58,434 --> 00:42:00,395
Behold!

516
00:42:00,478 --> 00:42:03,481
- The Amazing Maleeni's wallet.
- You picked his pocket?

517
00:42:03,564 --> 00:42:08,778
I pilfered it from the evidence room
to prevent their final act of prestidigitation.

518
00:42:08,861 --> 00:42:10,905
- What do you mean?
- I began to wonder,

519
00:42:10,988 --> 00:42:13,074
why did they need so elaborate a setup?

520
00:42:13,157 --> 00:42:17,954
Why so high-profile? Why draw
the attention of the FBI in the first place?

521
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,708
- We were the last piece of the puzzle.
- Alvarez was a misdirection.

522
00:42:21,791 --> 00:42:25,712
This trick was about EFTs,
electronic funds transfers at the bank.

523
00:42:25,795 --> 00:42:29,173
Maleeni, Pinchbeck, he didn't
have security clearance,

524
00:42:29,257 --> 00:42:32,260
so he needed federal law
enforcement intervention -

525
00:42:32,343 --> 00:42:34,554
specifically, my badge number...

526
00:42:36,472 --> 00:42:38,558
and my thumbprint.

527
00:42:39,308 --> 00:42:43,146
With those two items,
they could steal enough electronically

528
00:42:43,271 --> 00:42:47,316
as to make that $1.8 million
look like cigar-lighting money.

529
00:42:48,735 --> 00:42:51,070
But they can't do it without this.

530
00:42:52,447 --> 00:42:56,200
Pick a card, Scully. Any card.

531
00:43:00,288 --> 00:43:03,499
There's still one thing
that you haven't explained.

532
00:43:03,583 --> 00:43:05,293
What's that?

533
00:43:05,376 --> 00:43:08,755
How Maleeni was able to turn
his head completely around.

534
00:43:08,838 --> 00:43:12,717
- I don't know that.
- I do. I'll show you.

535
00:43:12,842 --> 00:43:14,886
Observe.

536
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:33,988
Gee! Very nice. How'd you do that?

537
00:43:36,032 --> 00:43:39,076
Well... magic.

538
00:43:39,202 --> 00:43:41,537
No, seriously, Scully, how'd you do it?

539
00:43:43,623 --> 00:43:48,002
You know, it's not the same thing.
It's different with the head.

540
00:43:48,085 --> 00:43:50,213
Come on. Look at this.

541
00:44:31,379 --> 00:44:34,173

542
00:44:34,257 --> 00:44:35,967
(Child) I made this.
