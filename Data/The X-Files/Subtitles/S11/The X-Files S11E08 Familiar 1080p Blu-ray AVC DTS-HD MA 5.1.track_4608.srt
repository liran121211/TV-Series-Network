but if a man did this...

85

...and it would typically be a man, he would be
emboldened by escaping detection...

86
00:05:17,486 --> 00:05:20,489
...and would likely kill again.
Evidence doesn't support that.

87
00:05:20,697 --> 00:05:23,992
Well, the broken neck supports that.
And the bite marks that you see...

106

It's a large black dog that guards the gates of
the underworld. That's neither here nor there.

107
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:35,939
The point is stranger things
have happened around here.

108
00:06:36,147 --> 00:06:39,234
In 1658, a Puritan midwife
named Goody Bishop...

109
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:41,945
...was accused of witchcraft
and lying with the devil.

110
00:06:42,153 --> 00:06:46,658
Legend has it she spontaneously combusted
in front of the assembled townsfolk.

111
00:06:46,866 --> 00:06:49,119
Right over there.
As we've discussed before...

112
00:06:49,327 --> 00:06:53,498
...people don't just spontaneously oombust.
That woman was undoubtedly an innocent...

113
00:06:53,707 --> 00:06:56,668
...a tragic victim
of religious persecution and hysteria.

114
00:06:56,876 --> 00:06:59,754
And anybody would know that
if they read beyond the tourist literature.

115
00:06:59,963 --> 00:07:03,216
Because there were bogus witch hunts
doesn't mean that there were no witches.

116
00:07:03,425 --> 00:07:07,345
While I do sadly concede there are probably
no ooywolves in Eastwood, Connecticut...

117
00:07:07,554 --> 00:07:10,390
...I suspect there are still
practitioners of the black arts.

118
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:14,144
Practice all they want, it doesn't mean
witchcraft has any basis in reality.

00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:18,064
Yeah, well, and yet a young boy is dead.

120
00:07:18,398 --> 00:07:21,985
The only devil here probably parks right here
in front of the playground...

Irregular lacerations and abrasions
on the neck, throat and torso.

128

A significant amount
of the lower abdomen...

...is completely torn out and missing.

130
00:08:12,535 --> 00:08:14,829
That would appear to agree
with their findings.

131
00:08:15,038 --> 00:08:17,123
Well, evisceration fits animal predation...

132
00:08:17,332 --> 00:08:21,544
...but the condition of the body makes it almost
impossible to determine when it happened.
