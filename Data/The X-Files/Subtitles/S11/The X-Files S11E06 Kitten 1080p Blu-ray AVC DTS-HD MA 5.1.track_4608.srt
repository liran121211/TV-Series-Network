508
00:39:46,678 --> 00:39:50,557
And he was so afraid all the time.
I felt like I had to protect him.

509
00:39:51,683 --> 00:39:53,351
But I didn't.

510
00:39:56,563 --> 00:39:58,147
I couldn't.

511
00:40:01,734 --> 00:40:04,320
That experience in Vietnam with John...

512
00:40:04,487 --> 00:40:08,533
...it put a dent in that blind faith
that I had in my government.

513
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,661
It planted seeds of mistrust.

514
00:40:11,828 --> 00:40:16,541
I tried for years to suppress that mistrust,
but it gnawed at me.

516
00:40:19,627 --> 00:40:21,129
Then you two.

517
00:40:26,259 --> 00:40:31,139
You two came along
and you taught me not to hide from it...

518
00:40:31,306 --> 00:40:36,686
...but to have the guts to shine a light
directly into the darkest corners.

519
00:40:36,853 --> 00:40:40,064
And if given the choice
between advancing my career...

520
00:40:40,231 --> 00:40:45,111
...by being blindly loyal to some faceless
puppeteers pulling strings from the shadows...

521
00:40:45,278 --> 00:40:48,239
...or to throw in with you two,
make no mistake about it...

522
00:40:48,406 --> 00:40:51,117
...I'd make the same decision
every single damn time.

523
00:40:55,371 --> 00:40:59,083
So I'm gonna go back,
I'm gonna kiss the ring.

524
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:03,504
But I intend to do right by this man...

525
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:07,592
...and that means finding the truth
of what the hell it was they used him for.

526
00:41:08,092 --> 00:41:10,053
No matter the cost.

527
00:41:16,184 --> 00:41:17,727
I owe him that.

529
