After the crash at Roswell...

363

...our government's interest in alien
technology exploded in all directions.

364
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:09,041
And finally, in the '70s, our science
caught up to our ambition.

365
00:29:09,207 --> 00:29:12,002
A eugenics program was initiated
by a Dr. Masao Matsumoto...

366
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:15,464
...using components of alien
technology, hybrid DNA.

367

I read the report.

368
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:21,553

because they couldn't predict...

369
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,556
...what attributes the test subjects
would get from the hybrid DNA.

370
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:27,559
That's correct. The project
was defunded 15 years ago.

371
00:29:27,726 --> 00:29:31,688
Dr. Matsumoto burned all the files
pertaining to the subjects to save their lives...

372
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:33,774
