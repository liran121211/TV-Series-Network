I know that in my bones.

501
00:37:44,055 --> 00:37:46,349
And William knows it.

502
00:37:47,642 --> 00:37:49,436
They won't find him...

503
00:37:49,644 --> 00:37:51,187
...but he will find us.

504
00:37:54,482 --> 00:37:58,445
So we just wait?

505
00:37:58,653 --> 00:38:00,488
Do nothing?

506
00:38:02,574 --> 00:38:04,826
We do our work.

507
00:38:06,494 --> 00:38:09,706
The truth still lies in the X-Files, Mulder.

508
00:38:16,963 --> 00:38:18,673
They said you were attacked.

509
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:20,717
I was calling you.

510
00:38:21,134 --> 00:38:24,262
I didn't get your call.
Where have you been, Skinner?

511
00:38:25,513 --> 00:38:26,598
Where have you been?

512
00:38:26,806 --> 00:38:29,642
Leave it alone, Mulder.
I asked you to look for her.

513
00:38:29,851 --> 00:38:31,728
I looked for her.
Where did you look?

514
00:38:32,854 --> 00:38:34,189
I said leave it alone.

515
00:38:35,690 --> 00:38:37,025
You smell like smoke.

516
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:39,736
Mulder.

Whose side are you on?

520
00:38:52,749 --> 00:38:54,626
I said leave it alone, Mulder.

00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,589
MULDER:
What are you hiding?

522
00:39:02,133 --> 00:39:05,386
What could possibly make you think
that I would ever take your deal?

523
00:39:05,595 --> 00:39:07,180
You're not betraying Scully.

524
00:39:07,388 --> 00:39:10,767
She'll be with us. She's immune.
You get off on this, don't you?

525
00:39:10,934 --> 00:39:14,187
Ha, ha. Manufacturing destiny?
Then why kill Mulder?

526
00:39:14,395 --> 00:39:17,774
Mulder would kill me.
Scully will never take your offer.

527
00:39:19,776 --> 00:39:22,070
She'll take it.
Not without Mulder, she won't.

528
00:39:22,278 --> 00:39:24,531
I'll present her with a simple choice.

529
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:26,908
Mulder or her only son.

530
00:39:27,116 --> 00:39:29,452
So this is just vengeance.

531
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:31,037
Oh, it's more than that.

532
00:39:32,664 --> 00:39:34,958
Dana and I have a history.

533
00:39:35,416 --> 00:39:39,379
<i>A very important history
that goes back 17 years.</i>

I'm glad you came.

535
00:39:48,012 --> 00:39:49,305
We'll need to take a trip.

536
00:39:50,265 --> 00:39:51,808
I'm here.

537
00:39:52,016 --> 00:39:53,309
It will require a few days.

You drugged me.

00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:13,871
Ha, ha. I did nothing of the sort.

541
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:19,043
How did I get out of my clothes and into bed?
We carried you, my housekeeper and I.

542
00:40:19,252 --> 00:40:23,381
You'd been up for over 30 hours.
You were delirious. You can ask her.

543
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:25,883
I don't know what you're up to.

544
00:40:26,884 --> 00:40:28,678
You impregnated her?

545
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:31,889
With science, Mr. Skinner.

To create the first superhuman child.

Mulder's not the father?

549
00:40:42,233 --> 00:40:46,446
I'm asking, who's the father?

550
00:40:47,989 --> 00:40:49,532
I am.

551
00:40:49,741 --> 00:40:51,326
William is my son.
