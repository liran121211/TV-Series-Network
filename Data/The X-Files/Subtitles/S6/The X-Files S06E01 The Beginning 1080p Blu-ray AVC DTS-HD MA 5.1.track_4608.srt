00:00:28,655 --> 00:00:32,284
Next time, maybe take a leak
before we leave work, OK, dipwads?

4
00:00:32,367 --> 00:00:34,453
Can you read sign language, guy?

5
00:00:35,204 --> 00:00:38,790
Is that your IQ or the number
of dipwads your mother had?

00:00:57,643 --> 00:01:00,687
Sorry, man. You gotta
hold it till you get home.

9
00:01:26,505 --> 00:01:28,548
I'll see you tomorrow, Sandy.

Hey, Sandman?

<i>(screaming)</i>

21
00:05:14,858 --> 00:05:19,821
By restoring moisture to the documents,
and by a reassembling of fragments,

22
00:05:19,905 --> 00:05:23,033
I can recover a large percentage
of the case material

23
00:05:23,116 --> 00:05:27,454
that was destroyed in my office fire
several months ago.

24
00:05:27,537 --> 00:05:30,916
While this process is tedious,
what I've already recovered

25
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:35,295
will allow Agent Scully and I to begin work
on the X-Files immediately.

26
00:05:39,007 --> 00:05:41,301
Agent Mulder...

27
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:45,055
Agent Mulder, I'm reading here
a very pie-in-the-sky report

28
00:05:45,138 --> 00:05:49,976
about global domination plans
by vicious long-clawed spacelings.

29
00:05:50,852 --> 00:05:54,481
Is there going to be data to back
this vague omnibus account?

30
00:05:54,564 --> 00:05:55,398
Yes.

31
00:05:55,482 --> 00:05:59,027
I see your renowned arrogance
has been left quite intact.

32
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:01,780
You're asking us to accept this report

33
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:07,327
of a spaceship buried under polar ice
and your death-defying escape from it?

34
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:12,541
The ice became superheated by the ship
as it rose beneath us, causing it to collapse.

35
00:06:12,624 --> 00:06:17,087
This story is unintelligible
and encourages unintelligible analysis.

36
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:22,050
I hoped you'd look closely at the reports
of mine and Scully's medical conditions.

37
00:06:22,133 --> 00:06:24,636
These spacelings, Agent Mulder...

38
00:06:24,719 --> 00:06:28,557
<i>They weren't something</i> I <i>saw
in Men in Black?</i>

39
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:32,936
- I didn't see Men in <i>Black.</i>
- Well, it's a damn good movie.

40
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:35,230
This may sound like science fiction,

41
00:06:35,313 --> 00:06:37,941
but we can and will prove
the validity of our report.

42
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:41,069
So the plot... I'm just trying
to get this straight.

43
00:06:41,152 --> 00:06:45,156
The plot is for these spacelings
to take over the planet,

44
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,158
aided by a group of men on Earth...

45
00:06:47,242 --> 00:06:49,536
A conspiracy within our own government.

46
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:53,081
...who are growing corn in the desert,
which features pollen,

47
00:06:53,164 --> 00:06:56,167
which was genetically altered
to hold a virus,

48
00:06:56,251 --> 00:07:00,797
which will be taken away by bees
whose sting transmits the virus,

49
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:06,511
causing the growth of an extraterrestrial
biological entity inside the human host?

50
00:07:06,595 --> 00:07:11,182
Which we will prove now that
the X-Files have been reopened.

51
00:07:11,266 --> 00:07:15,186
Your presumption, Agent Mulder,
is far greater than the case you make.

52
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:16,605
I don't understand.

53
00:07:16,688 --> 00:07:18,982
You justify your reassignment on the X-Files

54
00:07:19,065 --> 00:07:23,320
with little more than a rattletrap account
of high adventure in the Antarctic.

55
00:07:23,403 --> 00:07:26,156
Not to mention some
questionable travel expenses.

56
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:29,451
Let us remind you that the FBI
is not a school for science

57
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:32,370
or for the grinding of personal axes.

58
00:07:32,454 --> 00:07:35,790
Hopefully, you can present us
with some material evidence

59
00:07:35,874 --> 00:07:37,917
to support an investigation.

60
00:07:38,001 --> 00:07:42,756
Agent Scully was assigned
to the X-Files as a scientist,

61
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:46,134
was stung by a bee,
and was infected with this virus.

62
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:49,638
She is here today with hard
and incontrovertible evidence.

63
00:07:49,721 --> 00:07:55,769
Scientific proof that the virus she was
infected with is in fact... extraterrestrial.

64
00:08:05,487 --> 00:08:08,156
Next time I'll wear a clown suit
and do tricks.

65
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:09,824
I hoped it wouldn't come up.

66
00:08:09,908 --> 00:08:14,037
I was there because you assured me there
was a scientific basis for what we saw.

67
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:17,624
Let me remind you once again
that what I saw was very little.

68
00:08:17,707 --> 00:08:19,709
That excuse is not gonna work.

69
00:08:19,793 --> 00:08:22,504
You were there and you were
infected with that virus.

70
00:08:22,587 --> 00:08:27,509
Yes, there is a scientific basis for what
happened to me. I was exposed to a virus.

71
00:08:27,592 --> 00:08:32,138
But as it turns out, Mulder,
that virus is not what you thought.

72
00:08:32,222 --> 00:08:36,351
Look, I can't identify it, Mulder.
I have run three separate tests.

73
00:08:36,434 --> 00:08:41,815
But I can tell you that that virus's DNA
and proteins are very much of this world.

74
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:45,026
I saw what that virus did.
I saw it generate a new being.

75
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:47,362
An alien being inside a human body.

76
00:08:47,445 --> 00:08:51,783
It attacks and destroys human cells,
but that is all it does, Mulder.

77
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:54,369
It creates nothing.

78
00:08:54,452 --> 00:08:59,207
Look, I don't like telling you this.
And I know that you don't wanna hear it.

79
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:04,879
You can question me and what I saw,
but what you can't question is the science.

80
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:19,477
There was sloppiness in Phoenix
where they found the body.

81
00:09:19,561 --> 00:09:24,524
The local PD got involved. These were
taken at the scene by a crime reporter.

82
00:09:24,607 --> 00:09:26,401
These were run in the press?

83
00:09:26,484 --> 00:09:30,071
I trumped up a story about
a crazy Indian on the loose.

84
00:09:30,155 --> 00:09:34,534
Never underestimate the public's
willingness to blame the red man for...

85
00:09:34,617 --> 00:09:36,035
what they can't explain.

86
00:09:36,119 --> 00:09:38,788
- How did this happen?
- He was one of ours.

87
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:42,709
He must've accidentally injected
himself while he was working.

88
00:09:42,792 --> 00:09:45,712
It took just 1 <i>2</i> hours
for the creature to gestate.

89
00:09:45,795 --> 00:09:48,882
- This thing's alive?
- Yes.

90
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:53,970
- It's killed a man.
- It's out there somewhere?

91
00:09:54,053 --> 00:09:55,805
As far as I know.

92
00:09:55,889 --> 00:09:59,768
Lord Almighty! We can't have
this thing running loose.

93
00:09:59,851 --> 00:10:01,770
I'm managing the situation.

94
00:10:01,853 --> 00:10:05,982
- Someone's gotta find this thing.
- Someone has to kill it.

95
00:10:07,358 --> 00:10:10,820
The response must be equal to the threat.

96
00:10:11,237 --> 00:10:13,573
Can you dispose of this problem?

97
00:10:16,785 --> 00:10:18,661
Yes.

98
00:10:20,246 --> 00:10:22,791
<i>(door opens)</i>

99
00:10:22,874 --> 00:10:25,043
Wasting your time.

100
00:10:25,126 --> 00:10:28,755
You need evidence. I've just got
to bring it back from the ashes.

101
00:10:28,838 --> 00:10:34,177
Nothing you might restore is gonna help
you, Agent Mulder. It's over and done.

102
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:36,971
Your reassignment has been denied.

103
00:10:37,305 --> 00:10:42,310
How can it be denied? We're the only reason
the X-Files were reopened in the first place.

104
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:44,854
- I'm not arguing with you.
- Well, who is?

105
00:10:44,938 --> 00:10:47,649
When will you accept
that no amount of reason

106
00:10:47,732 --> 00:10:52,987
will bring to heel a conspiracy whose
members walk these halls with impunity?

107
00:10:56,074 --> 00:10:58,159
Was there a vote?

108
00:11:00,787 --> 00:11:03,164
Unanimous against.

109
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:19,764
Excuse me.

110
00:11:25,270 --> 00:11:27,981
I'm no help to you outside
the majority, Mulder.

111
00:11:28,064 --> 00:11:31,150
I don't see that there's a damn thing
you can do for me.

112
00:11:31,234 --> 00:11:34,237
You can break their backs
with proof about this virus.

113
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,658
- Proof that what you say it does is true.
- I don't have that proof yet.

114
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:42,161
Maybe I can give it to you.

115
00:11:45,415 --> 00:11:48,293
There's a file folder.

116
00:11:48,376 --> 00:11:51,838
It's on the desk in your old office.

117
00:12:15,987 --> 00:12:18,740
Is that something for me?

118
00:12:18,823 --> 00:12:20,575
Agent Mulder?

119
00:12:20,658 --> 00:12:23,953
- Yeah, if you're doing my filing.
- Your filing?

120
00:12:24,037 --> 00:12:25,955
Why are you in my office, Agent Spender?

121
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:30,543
I think there's been a miscommunication.
I think someone failed to inform you.

122
00:12:30,627 --> 00:12:35,673
If you're saying you were sent to work on
the X-Files, the failure is simple judgment.

123
00:12:35,757 --> 00:12:39,469
I don't care what patronage got you
this job. I put my life in here.

124
00:12:39,552 --> 00:12:42,931
I'm not gonna let some brown-nose
take it all away from me.

125
00:12:43,014 --> 00:12:45,892
I don't believe in
the paranormal mumbo jumbo,

126
00:12:45,975 --> 00:12:49,812
- so don't presume I'm taking your place.
- No? Who is?

127
00:12:50,521 --> 00:12:52,440
<i>(footsteps)</i>

128
00:12:55,777 --> 00:12:59,322
- Fox.
- Diana. Back on your feet.

129
00:13:03,284 --> 00:13:06,788
I guess that's the only way
you can stab me in the back.

130
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:07,348
I need the patient bandaged and dressed.
We'll be taking a trip.

131
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:11,144
You want him what?

132
00:14:11,227 --> 00:14:14,856
I'm sure I don't need to repeat myself.

133
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:17,483
Please get the boy ready.

134
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:22,030
- But doing that now could kill him.
- Let me put it to you simply.

135
00:14:22,113 --> 00:14:24,615
It's him or it's us.

136
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:51,017
I wanna remind you that
by not informing local PD

137
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:56,856
we are in technical violation of state laws
prohibiting contamination of a crime scene.

138
00:14:57,565 --> 00:14:59,650
Why do I bother?

139
00:15:03,571 --> 00:15:06,866
Scully, come here and take a look at this.

140
00:15:09,786 --> 00:15:12,288
Ever seen anything like this?

141
00:15:13,122 --> 00:15:16,292
- What are they?
- According to the investigator's notes,

142
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:21,130
they're from an attack by
a Native American man on a scientist.

143
00:15:21,214 --> 00:15:25,927
- With what kind of weapon?
- It says in the file he used his bare hands.

144
00:15:26,803 --> 00:15:28,888
His bare hands?

145
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:31,724
- This is hardwood.
- Uh-huh.

146
00:15:31,808 --> 00:15:35,853
This kind of gouging didn't happen
with anybody's bare hands.

147
00:15:36,646 --> 00:15:39,774
Not without the use of
some kind of an implement.

148
00:15:42,527 --> 00:15:44,612
What is that?

149
00:15:46,739 --> 00:15:50,118
Ah... Somebody broke a nail.

150
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:56,457
- Is it animal?
- It ain't RuPaul.

151
00:15:56,541 --> 00:16:03,172
The body of the other victim was found on
the sofa, his viscera torn from his torso.

152
00:16:03,256 --> 00:16:06,384
The ME's report says
the times of death were hours apart,

153
00:16:06,467 --> 00:16:10,555
which means that this victim was dead
hours before the second attack.

154
00:16:10,638 --> 00:16:13,724
- So the attacker never left.
- It wasn't an attack.

155
00:16:13,808 --> 00:16:16,936
I think it was celebrating its birthday.

156
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:22,191
The first victim was infected with the virus.
Right here is where the creature was born.

157
00:16:22,275 --> 00:16:25,361
- Mulder...
- It accounts for the violence to his torso.

158
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:28,197
The virus producing an extraterrestrial entity

159
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:32,201
that ripped away his chest
as it birthed itself right here. Look.

160
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:41,669
Given that scenario, the rate of gestation
would have been less than a day.

161
00:16:41,752 --> 00:16:43,838
It would've been about 12 hours.

162
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:46,007
OK, forgive the scientific argument.

163
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:49,468
But you're saying that this was
done by something newborn?

164
00:16:49,552 --> 00:16:52,054
That's exactly what I'm saying.

165
00:17:01,189 --> 00:17:03,274
It was here.

166
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,861
But it's gone now.

167
00:17:10,114 --> 00:17:12,700
- I should take a look.
- It's not here.

168
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:17,371
Why don't you believe me
when you're so afraid of me?

169
00:17:17,455 --> 00:17:18,623
I'm not afraid.

170
00:17:18,706 --> 00:17:22,293
You think I can destroy you
for what I know, cos of what I am.

171
00:17:22,376 --> 00:17:25,213
You're thinking you could've
destroyed me, too.

172
00:17:25,296 --> 00:17:28,257
And if I don't find this creature, you will.

173
00:17:33,304 --> 00:17:35,389
He'll find it.

174
00:17:35,473 --> 00:17:39,018
(Mulder) I don't see
there's any argument here.

175
00:17:39,101 --> 00:17:41,604
You admit yourself the crime report is a lie.

176
00:17:41,687 --> 00:17:45,650
Mulder, that doesn't mean
that I can just accept your theory.

177
00:17:46,776 --> 00:17:49,487
What does it take?
For this thing to bite you on the ass?

178
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:53,115
I saw these creatures.
I saw them burst to life.

179
00:17:53,199 --> 00:17:57,578
You would have seen them too,
but you were passed out over my shoulder.

180
00:17:57,662 --> 00:18:01,415
Mulder, I know what you did.
I know what happened to me.

181
00:18:01,499 --> 00:18:04,919
But without ignoring the science, I can't...

182
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:09,590
Listen, Mulder. You told me
that my science kept you honest,

183
00:18:09,674 --> 00:18:14,637
that it made you question your assumptions,
that by it I'd made you a whole person.

184
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:16,806
If I change now, it...

185
00:18:18,057 --> 00:18:21,435
it wouldn't be right... or honest.

186
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:28,401
I'm talking about extraterrestrial life
alive on this planet in our lifetime.

187
00:18:29,026 --> 00:18:32,613
Forces that dwarf and precede
all human history.

188
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:38,494
I'm sorry, Scully, but this time
your science is wrong.

Wake up, Homer.

191
00:19:23,748 --> 00:19:25,833
I was awake.

192
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:30,338
- I was just thinking.
- Yeah, that'd be a first.

193
00:19:30,421 --> 00:19:32,631
You're late on your systems check.

194
00:19:32,715 --> 00:19:35,509
If there was a problem,
we woulda heard about it.

195
00:19:35,593 --> 00:19:39,972
Like Arizona's gonna go without
air conditioning for ten minutes.

196
00:19:49,899 --> 00:19:53,778
Hey, Homer. Got something here
in the bleed cooling system.

197
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,200
See that?

198
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:04,663
- Five degrees off. I'll be...
- Might be in the core reactor.

199
00:20:04,747 --> 00:20:08,042
Nah, nah, nah.
It's gotta be a monitoring glitch.

200
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:12,797
Phone could start ringing any minute.
You might wanna check it out.

201
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,965
All right.

202
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:21,972

Authorised officers only.
This is a closed area.

211
00:22:00,029 --> 00:22:02,364
- What happened?
- You'll have to leave.

212
00:22:02,448 --> 00:22:04,492
We had a call that a man was killed.

213
00:22:04,575 --> 00:22:07,536
A call from whom?
Assistant Director Skinner?

214
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:12,249
- Let us through.
- You are unauthorised to be here.

215
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:14,919
You've come here
without cause or permission.

216
00:22:15,002 --> 00:22:19,131
I'm gonna get you censured and demand
a review of AD Skinner's actions.

217
00:22:19,215 --> 00:22:21,926
Diana, let us in here.

218
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:25,012
I can't. This facility has been
sealed off by the NRC.

219
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:26,305
A man was murdered.

220
00:22:26,388 --> 00:22:30,392
He was killed in an accident in a reactor
where there was a systems failure.

221
00:22:30,476 --> 00:22:31,602
Why are you here?

222
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:35,439
Because of a possible connection
to two previous deaths

223
00:22:35,523 --> 00:22:39,068
from a case file that
was stolen from our office.

224
00:22:39,151 --> 00:22:40,945
<i>(Sirens)</i>

225
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:45,074
- There is a connection.
- Let's get outta here, Mulder.

226
00:22:45,908 --> 00:22:48,244
I hope you know what you're doing, Diana.

227
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:50,996
I hope you know whose errands
you're running.

228
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:53,165
I think I do.

229
00:22:57,086 --> 00:23:00,047
We weren't getting anywhere.
It was making it worse.

230
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:02,299
It's here, Scully, and they know it.

231
00:23:02,383 --> 00:23:05,886
How do they know?
Mulder, how do you know?

232
00:23:05,970 --> 00:23:08,597
Give me the keys and get in the car.

233
00:23:12,851 --> 00:23:14,895
Oh, my God.

234
00:23:14,979 --> 00:23:17,064
Gibson.

235
00:23:18,232 --> 00:23:19,483
Sorry, sweetie.

236
00:23:20,818 --> 00:23:23,487
Gibson? Gibson?

237
00:23:24,488 --> 00:23:27,950
Gibson, sweetheart? Oh, God.

238
00:24:00,524 --> 00:24:03,360
Frankenstein? Really?

239
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:06,155
No.

240
00:24:06,614 --> 00:24:09,450
No, you've been worked on
by some good doctors.

241
00:24:09,742 --> 00:24:12,244
They did a fine job of your stitches.

242
00:24:13,245 --> 00:24:15,789
You think they were butchers.

243
00:24:17,082 --> 00:24:19,335
They were butchers.

244
00:24:20,544 --> 00:24:24,340
They should've changed
your bandages, Gibson.

245
00:24:24,423 --> 00:24:27,301
You've got some swelling
and some infection.

246
00:24:28,677 --> 00:24:30,804
And you've got a fever.

247
00:24:32,931 --> 00:24:37,645
- Why did they do this to you?
- Cos I can read people's minds.

248
00:24:41,482 --> 00:24:46,487
- How did you get in our car?
- When they weren't looking, I snuck away.

249
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:49,615
It's easy when you know
what they're thinking.

250
00:24:50,491 --> 00:24:51,700
Why are you here?

251
00:24:51,784 --> 00:24:55,371
They were using me,
cos I can communicate with it.

252
00:24:59,333 --> 00:25:00,834
Communicate with what?

253
00:25:00,918 --> 00:25:04,546
You already know.
You just don't wanna believe it.

254
00:25:17,601 --> 00:25:20,020
The kid could find this thing.

255
00:25:20,104 --> 00:25:23,565
- Mulder, he belongs in a hospital.
- We could get his fever down.

256
00:25:23,649 --> 00:25:26,485
Mulder, you can't just
take him on some snipe hunt.

257
00:25:26,568 --> 00:25:30,239
He belongs in a bed
under constant medical care.

258
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:33,784
Listen to me. What I'm saying
is in your best interest, OK?

259
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:38,872
We have to take every precaution
to ensure that nothing happens to this boy,

260
00:25:38,956 --> 00:25:44,086
because, whatever he is, whatever gives him
the ability to do what he does,

261
00:25:44,169 --> 00:25:47,506
he's your scientific evidence.
It's just like we said.

262
00:25:47,589 --> 00:25:51,760
- He could be the key to all the X-Files.
- We don't have the X-Files.

263
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:57,558
No. But what if he could corroborate
everything that you're saying?

264
00:25:57,641 --> 00:26:00,102
This boy could be our last best chance.

265
00:26:26,211 --> 00:26:28,380
(Diana) Agent Mulder?

266
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:34,219
Fox, I'm going to get out of the car.
I'm alone, all right?

267
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:42,895
- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't say anything to you earlier.

268
00:26:42,978 --> 00:26:48,108
I was given this assignment, Fox, OK?
They offered it to me. I took the chance.

269
00:26:48,192 --> 00:26:49,151
I'm listening.

270
00:26:49,234 --> 00:26:53,864
To make sure someone served your interests,
someone who believes in the work.

271
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:57,785
Hey, you and I found the X-Files together.
Don't forget that.

272
00:26:57,868 --> 00:26:59,953
- Who sent you?
- I'm here on my own.

273
00:27:00,037 --> 00:27:03,832
- Why? To convince me of your intentions?
- Listen to me.

274
00:27:03,916 --> 00:27:06,460
That thing is inside the No.4 reactor building.

275
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:10,297
We can let them find it and destroy it,
or go find it ourselves.

276
00:27:11,423 --> 00:27:14,218
You need proof, Fox.

277
00:27:14,301 --> 00:27:17,679
You're so close. Why can't you see that?

278
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:33,612
Mulder, what's going on?

279
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:36,615
- You take Gibson.
- Where are you going?

280
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:38,951
To find this thing.

281
00:27:51,964 --> 00:27:56,718
Agent Spender and I got a call. We were on
a plane within an hour in constant contact.

282
00:27:56,802 --> 00:27:59,263
- With who?
- The nuclear regulatory people.

283
00:27:59,346 --> 00:28:02,182
NRC was first on the scene.
They found the victim.

284
00:28:02,266 --> 00:28:05,310
When we got there, it had been removed.
We never saw the body.

285
00:28:05,394 --> 00:28:09,398
- Who removed it?
- I don't know. Couldn't get a straight answer.

286
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:11,984
Then the NRC sealed off the No.4 reactor

287
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:16,947
due to a problem with the heat transfer
systems. I believe that was legitimate.

288
00:28:17,030 --> 00:28:21,285
Maybe that's why it's there.
It wants heat. It needs heat.

289
00:28:21,827 --> 00:28:25,789
This thing gestated abnormally fast.
What if heat activates it?

290
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:29,376
It could spur on the virus
and the development of the entity.

291
00:28:29,459 --> 00:28:33,797
- But it's still seeking heat. Why?
- What if it's still developing?

292
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:40,721
You don't think what we're looking for
makes sense in any conventional way?

293
00:28:40,804 --> 00:28:43,348
No.

294
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:53,150
You're gonna be fine, Gibson.
You're gonna be OK.

295
00:28:56,445 --> 00:28:58,530
Let's get a bed ready.

296
00:29:00,115 --> 00:29:03,994
- You're gonna run more tests.
- We're gonna get you well.

297
00:29:04,077 --> 00:29:08,206
You say that, but you're gonna run
more tests, like the other doctors.

298
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:10,500
We have to run this one test, Gibson.

299
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:13,670
You wanna make me well,
but you're thinking about yourself

300
00:29:13,754 --> 00:29:16,256
and what you can learn from me.

301
00:29:25,849 --> 00:29:30,103
You're a very special boy, Gibson.
You know that yourself.

302
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:33,315
I'm a very special lab rat.

303
00:30:31,248 --> 00:30:37,212
(Diana) According to what we could gather,
the victim's body was found near here.

304
00:30:37,295 --> 00:30:40,757
- It's hot in here.
- We're right above the core reactor.

305
00:30:40,841 --> 00:30:43,885
This is part of
the heat transfer cooling system.

306
00:30:55,188 --> 00:30:58,692
- Looks organic.
- Maybe somebody's got the flu.

307
00:31:48,742 --> 00:31:52,370
<i>- (gasps)</i>
- What? <i>What is it?</i>

308
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:55,082
There's something in there.

309
00:32:21,983 --> 00:32:24,444
<i>(cellphone rings)</i>

310
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,158
<i>(Mulder) Yeah?</i>

311
00:32:30,242 --> 00:32:33,120
Mulder, I found something
you're not gonna believe.

312
00:32:33,495 --> 00:32:34,538
Ditto.

313
00:32:34,621 --> 00:32:39,709
We did blood tests on Gibson. Mulder,
there's evidence of the virus in his system.

314
00:32:40,418 --> 00:32:43,839
- The same virus you were exposed to?
- I'm almost positive.

315
00:32:43,922 --> 00:32:45,048
<i>What does that mean?</i>

316
00:32:45,132 --> 00:32:48,301
I don't know, but I think
we're onto something.

317
00:32:48,385 --> 00:32:52,889
- <i>We're onto something huge,</i> a <i>link.</i>
- I'll call <i>that bet and raise</i> you.

318
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,725
- What?
- Never mind. Just take care of Gibson.

319
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:25,547
There was a little boy in that room
and he's gone.

320
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:28,842
Does anybody know what happened
to that little boy?

321
00:33:28,925 --> 00:33:33,597
His name is Gibson Praise!
He was just in that room!

322
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:36,141
Does anybody know
what the hell is going on?

323
00:33:36,224 --> 00:33:39,436
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let's just calm down.

324
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:43,815
- That little boy I brought in is missing.
- He can't be. He should be in his bed.

325
00:33:43,899 --> 00:33:45,734
He's not here!

326
00:35:36,553 --> 00:35:39,347
- He's here.
- Where?

327
00:35:41,975 --> 00:35:44,060
Somewhere.

328
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:18,970
- <i>(pounding on door)</i>
- <i>Open the door, you son of</i> a <i>bitch!</i>

329
00:36:19,054 --> 00:36:22,640
Open the door, damn it! Open it!

330
00:36:23,767 --> 00:36:24,934
Open the door, you...

331
00:36:25,018 --> 00:36:29,230
Fox! I'm gonna go see if
there's some other way in!

332
00:36:30,357 --> 00:36:33,026
Open it! Open this door!

333
00:36:35,987 --> 00:36:39,240
- I <i>told you it was here.</i>
<i>- (creature screeches)</i>

334
00:36:39,324 --> 00:36:41,326
<i>(man screams)</i>

335
00:36:41,409 --> 00:36:43,203
<i>(screeching)</i>

336
00:36:49,667 --> 00:36:52,253
Gibson! Gibson!

337
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:57,133
<i>- Gibson!
- (alarm)</i>

338
00:36:57,217 --> 00:36:59,302
<i>(shouting)</i>

339
00:37:11,898 --> 00:37:15,110
Gibson! Gibson!

340
00:37:16,444 --> 00:37:19,823
Gibson! Gibson!

341
00:37:24,869 --> 00:37:28,706
As I said, and as I am
forced to reiterate, Agent Mulder,

342
00:37:28,790 --> 00:37:34,045
the FBI is not here for vendettas
or for the grinding of personal axes.

343
00:37:34,129 --> 00:37:37,882
This holds not just for you,
but for everyone at the Bureau.

344
00:37:37,966 --> 00:37:43,138
You force us to put a point on this,
to make some hard changes.

345
00:37:43,221 --> 00:37:48,476
You and Agent Scully will cease all
material association with the X-Files.

346
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,813
Refusal to do so
will end in immediate dismissal.

347
00:37:51,896 --> 00:37:55,275
A probationary period will be set.

348
00:37:55,358 --> 00:37:58,778
You will now report
to Assistant Director Kersh.

349
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,794
You're not supposed to come here.

350
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:19,424
It's what was agreed to.
It's the deal you made.

351
00:38:19,507 --> 00:38:24,262
I had to congratulate you,
commend how you handled things.

352
00:38:29,267 --> 00:38:31,769
How you handled Mulder.

353
00:38:31,853 --> 00:38:33,938
I did what I was asked.

354
00:38:35,231 --> 00:38:40,695
You did well, son.
He's on very thin ice now, you know.

355
00:38:41,279 --> 00:38:45,783
Mulder will be back.
As long as he lives, he won't give up.

356
00:38:45,867 --> 00:38:49,037
Well, there are solutions, of course.

357
00:38:49,496 --> 00:38:52,290
Simple but extreme solutions.

358
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:57,212
I've used these methods.
They have their place.

359
00:38:58,796 --> 00:39:00,882
But not here.

360
00:39:03,593 --> 00:39:05,678
You've killed men.

361
00:39:06,804 --> 00:39:08,890
You can kill a man.

362
00:39:10,350 --> 00:39:13,061
But you can't kill what he stands for.

363
00:39:14,979 --> 00:39:17,899
Not unless you first break his spirit.

364
00:39:21,361 --> 00:39:23,863
That's a beautiful thing to see.

365
00:39:37,335 --> 00:39:39,420
<i>(door opens)</i>

366
00:39:41,631 --> 00:39:47,554
If you shut the door, it'd be harder to see
that I'm disregarding everything I was told.

367
00:39:52,850 --> 00:39:55,812
Everything <i>we</i> were told, Mulder.

368
00:39:57,981 --> 00:40:01,985
They can't take away
the X-Files, Scully. They tried.

369
00:40:02,068 --> 00:40:07,824
You know, Agent Fowley's report to OPR
painted the facts in an interesting way.

370
00:40:07,907 --> 00:40:09,534
I hope you weren't betrayed.

371
00:40:09,617 --> 00:40:12,453
Agent Fowley's report
was a means to an end:

372
00:40:12,537 --> 00:40:15,915
trying to protect the work,
protect the X-Files.

373
00:40:15,999 --> 00:40:19,419
Agent Fowley's report states
that the man you saw attacked

374
00:40:19,502 --> 00:40:22,088
was bludgeoned by an unknown subject.

375
00:40:22,171 --> 00:40:25,967
She makes no mention of a little boy
who is nowhere to be found.

376
00:40:26,217 --> 00:40:30,305
It would seem that her report
protects everything but you.

377
00:40:30,388 --> 00:40:34,142
Agent Fowley took me to that plant
at great risk to herself,

378
00:40:34,225 --> 00:40:38,146
where I saw something that you refuse
to believe in. Saw it again.

379
00:40:38,229 --> 00:40:41,608
And though it may not say it in her report,
Diana saw it, too.

380
00:40:41,691 --> 00:40:44,360
She's certainly not gonna go around saying

381
00:40:44,444 --> 00:40:48,656
that just because science
can't prove it, it isn't true.

382
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:51,826
I don't doubt what you saw, Mulder.

383
00:40:51,909 --> 00:40:54,203
I don't doubt you.

384
00:40:54,287 --> 00:40:59,334
I'm willing to believe, but not in a lie
and not in the opposite of what I can prove.

385
00:41:03,671 --> 00:41:06,466
It comes down to a matter of trust.

386
00:41:10,803 --> 00:41:13,181
I guess it always has.

387
00:41:16,893 --> 00:41:22,106
- You're asking me to make a choice?
- I'm asking you to trust my judgment.

388
00:41:25,401 --> 00:41:27,487
To trust me.

389
00:41:32,116 --> 00:41:35,328
I can't accept that if it refutes
what I know to be true.

390
00:41:35,411 --> 00:41:40,875
Mulder, these are test results.
DNA from the claw nail we found,

391
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:45,630
matching exactly the DNA from the virus
you believe is extraterrestrial.

392
00:41:48,174 --> 00:41:50,510
That's the connection.

393
00:41:50,593 --> 00:41:55,056
Which matches exactly DNA
that was found in Gibson Praise.

394
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:02,063
I don't understand. You're saying
that Gibson is infected with the virus?

395
00:42:02,146 --> 00:42:07,402
No. It's a part of his DNA.
In fact, it's a part of all of our DNA.

396
00:42:07,485 --> 00:42:09,779
It's called a genetic remnant.

397
00:42:09,862 --> 00:42:13,991
It's inactive junk DNA,
except in Gibson it's turned on.

398
00:42:16,577 --> 00:42:22,458
So if that were true, that would mean
that Gibson is in some part extraterrestrial.

399
00:42:22,542 --> 00:42:25,169
It would mean that all of us are.

400
