00:00:04,756 --> 00:00:08,135
<i>(announcer) We interrupt this
programme for breaking news.</i>

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:12,389
<i>(anchorman) 90 miles is how far
officers of the Nevada Highway Patrol</i>

3
00:00:12,472 --> 00:00:15,142
<i>have pursued the blue car on your screen</i>

4
00:00:15,267 --> 00:00:17,811
<i>in a wild chase
right through the heart of Elko,</i>

5
00:00:17,936 --> 00:00:20,981
<i>at speeds approaching
100 miles an hour.</i>

6
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:25,027
<i>Live on the scene is Chuck Pickering
in the "Fox 11 News" chopper.</i>

7
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:26,778
<i>Chuck, what can you tell us?</i>

8
00:00:27,362 --> 00:00:32,326
<i>Benjamin, we're heading west following
Route 766, where it feeds off the I-80.</i>

9
00:00:32,451 --> 00:00:36,580
<i>Just under an hour ago, troopers
attempted to pull over the blue car,</i>

10
00:00:36,663 --> 00:00:38,790
<i>which we understand is stolen.</i>

11
00:00:38,874 --> 00:00:41,168
<i>That occurred on the 80 east of Wells.</i>

12
00:00:41,293 --> 00:00:44,838
<i>Since then, this driver has stopped
for nothing and nobody.</i>

13
00:00:44,963 --> 00:00:48,342
<i>- (Benjamin) Any word yet on the driver?
- Not at this time.</i>

14
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:51,887
<i>What we do think, and what we've
passed on to the highway patrol,</i>

15
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:55,724
<i>is that, from our vantage point,
we see another person in that car.</i>

16
00:00:55,807 --> 00:00:58,602
<i>See? Right there - a hand.</i>

17
00:00:58,685 --> 00:01:00,812
<i>It just moved. See, in the back seat?</i>

18
00:01:00,896 --> 00:01:04,149
<i>Now, we could possibly have
a hostage situation here,</i>

19
00:01:04,233 --> 00:01:08,570
<i>and obviously the sooner
they bring this vehicle to a stop...</i>

20
00:01:08,654 --> 00:01:10,322
<i>(Sirens)</i>

21
00:01:17,412 --> 00:01:20,415
<i>(Piercing tone)</i>

22
00:01:35,555 --> 00:01:39,184
Unit Six ready at milepost 13.

23
00:01:39,268 --> 00:01:42,020
<i>(man over radio) Coming your way, Six.</i>

24
00:02:07,713 --> 00:02:11,883
<i>(Chuck) That did the trick. The automobile
seems to be coming to a stop.</i>

25
00:02:11,967 --> 00:02:13,719
<i>(Benjamin) What did they use?</i>

26
00:02:13,802 --> 00:02:16,680
<i>(Chuck) It looked to be
a tyre-puncturing chain.</i>

27
00:02:16,763 --> 00:02:19,308
<i>Now the officers are approaching the car.</i>

28
00:02:19,391 --> 00:02:23,312
<i>One of them has opened the door,
and he has hold of the suspect.</i>

29
00:02:23,437 --> 00:02:27,524
<i>He's pulling him out.
He doesn't seem to have a weapon.</i>

30
00:02:27,607 --> 00:02:31,653
<i>(Benjamin) It looks like he doesn't
want to get out of that car.</i>

31
00:02:31,737 --> 00:02:34,156
Vicky! Vicky!

32
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,409
- (officer) Ma'am?
- Please get it out of my head.

33
00:02:38,618 --> 00:02:41,747
Let me go! Vicky!

34
00:02:45,584 --> 00:02:48,420
Vicky! No! No!

35
00:02:48,503 --> 00:02:51,882
<i>(Benjamin) The hostage is OK.
The highway patrol has her.</i>

36
00:02:51,965 --> 00:02:56,303
- <i>It looks like that driver is still fighting.</i>
- <i>(Chuck) He is putting up</i> a <i>fight.</i>

37
00:02:56,428 --> 00:03:00,849
<i>He seems to be a man with a few choice
words on the subject, as you can see.</i>

38
00:03:00,932 --> 00:03:04,394
<i>They're trying to restrain him.
We'll get a wider angle.</i>

39
00:03:04,478 --> 00:03:07,689
<i>See, there's the woman.
What the heck? She's...</i>

40
00:03:07,773 --> 00:03:10,984
Vicky! Vicky!

41
00:03:14,446 --> 00:03:17,949
<i>(Chuck) There, see? She's banging
her head against the window.</i>

42
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:20,452
<i>What the hell just happened?</i>

43
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:05,539
- Yeah?
- Uh... Virgil Nokes?

44
00:04:05,664 --> 00:04:09,543
I'm Agent Scully. This is Agent Mulder.
We're with the FBI.

45
00:04:10,752 --> 00:04:15,632
- Jehovah's Witness?
- No, sir. Federal Bureau of Investigation.

46
00:04:15,715 --> 00:04:20,178
But we do have a free copy of
The Watchtower for you, if you like.

47
00:04:20,262 --> 00:04:22,973
This is just a routine check.

48
00:04:23,056 --> 00:04:28,520
We understand that you recently ordered
5,000 pounds of ammonium nitrate fertiliser.

49
00:04:28,603 --> 00:04:31,189
Oh, you people. Come on in.

50
00:04:37,863 --> 00:04:40,198
- Sugar beets.
- Excuse me?

51
00:04:40,282 --> 00:04:43,118
I grow sugar beets.

52
00:04:43,201 --> 00:04:45,787
I got better things
to do with my fertiliser

53
00:04:45,871 --> 00:04:49,040
than go around blowing
government buildings sky-high.

54
00:04:49,124 --> 00:04:52,711
Yeah, well, as we said, sir,
this is just routine.

55
00:04:52,794 --> 00:04:55,464
So routine it numbs the mind.

56
00:04:56,590 --> 00:05:01,553
I've got my ag card and my papers
around here somewhere.

57
00:05:01,636 --> 00:05:03,889
Help me look for 'em, will ya?

58
00:05:03,972 --> 00:05:07,350
<i>As we reported earlier,
a wild police pursuit ended in tragedy</i>

59
00:05:07,434 --> 00:05:10,520
<i>with the death
of a 36-year-old female hostage.</i>

60
00:05:10,604 --> 00:05:13,815
<i>This was the scene
west of Elko, Nevada, one hour ago...</i>

61
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:16,485
Hey, Scully, take a look at this.

62
00:05:18,445 --> 00:05:22,032
<i>We want to warn our viewers
this footage is extremely graphic.</i>

63
00:05:22,115 --> 00:05:24,576
<i>(reporter) The hostage is inside the car.</i>

64
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:28,288
<i>It appears that she's banging
her head against the window.</i>

65
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:32,375
<i>(anchorman) At this time, officials
are refusing to identify the woman</i>

66
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:36,838
<i>or to speculate on how she died. They
stress it was not the result of a gunshot.</i>

67
00:05:36,922 --> 00:05:40,258
<i>A preliminary coroner's report
isn't expected for a day.</i>

68
00:05:40,342 --> 00:05:42,969
<i>Meanwhile, residents of northern Nevada...</i>

69
00:05:48,266 --> 00:05:52,062
Thank you, Captain. That's no problem.
We'd be happy to help.

70
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:53,146
Mm-hm.

71
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:55,941
- We'll be happy to help what?
- See you soon.

72
00:05:56,024 --> 00:05:59,361
- We're not going to Nevada.
- Come on, one quick side trip.

73
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:01,530
No. We have a whole new assignment.

74
00:06:01,613 --> 00:06:05,200
Running down people that buy fertiliser?
This is bozo work.

75
00:06:05,283 --> 00:06:10,372
This is the FBI equivalent of wearing
an orange jump suit and picking up trash.

76
00:06:10,455 --> 00:06:12,123
They mean to humiliate us.

77
00:06:12,207 --> 00:06:15,377
Look, Mulder, like it or not,
humiliated or not,

78
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:20,006
we're on domestic terrorism now.
And yes, this is a punishment.

79
00:06:20,131 --> 00:06:24,386
But if we wanna get back, we have to
follow orders. We can't freelance.

80
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:26,888
You saw the news.
What did you make of that?

81
00:06:26,972 --> 00:06:31,142
The obvious assumption is she was shot,
regardless of what the police say.

82
00:06:31,226 --> 00:06:32,394
Maybe it was a sniper.

83
00:06:32,477 --> 00:06:35,188
In the captain's words,
"She just sorta popped."

84
00:06:35,313 --> 00:06:38,608
What about this guy who tried
to take her hostage - her husband?

85
00:06:38,692 --> 00:06:43,113
Looked to me like he was trying
to warn the cops before she died.

86
00:06:43,196 --> 00:06:47,325
The sun will rise in America tomorrow,
regardless of whether we're at a farm

87
00:06:47,409 --> 00:06:51,204
investigating yet another
enormous pile of doo-doo.

88
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:55,667
We can be in and out in a day.
Nobody has to know.

89
00:07:03,341 --> 00:07:05,385
<i>(door clangs)</i>

90
00:07:21,026 --> 00:07:23,069
<i>(tone)</i>

91
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:40,045
Somebody! Please!

92
00:07:41,046 --> 00:07:43,590
It's starting!

93
00:07:43,715 --> 00:07:44,883
Somebody!

94
00:07:45,258 --> 00:07:46,676
Why can't we see him?

95
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,721
Hopefully later. He pitched
quite a fit in his cell,

96
00:07:49,804 --> 00:07:53,642
screamin' a bunch of nonsense
that we were gonna kill him like his wife.

97
00:07:53,725 --> 00:07:58,146
- He's not a particularly stable individual.
- He may need medical attention.

98
00:07:58,229 --> 00:08:01,775
He's getting it. Our doctor's with him now.

99
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:07,572
I mean, after whatever happened to his wife,
which I'd like to stress was not our fault,

100
00:08:08,239 --> 00:08:10,367
we're not gonna take any chances.

101
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,495
Patrick Garland Crump of Montello, Nevada.

102
00:08:13,578 --> 00:08:18,708
(Mulder) 40-year-old roofer,
no history of mental illness.

103
00:08:18,792 --> 00:08:22,003
- No prior record.
- He's got one now.

104
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:24,839
That Barracuda he jacked
on the Utah state line?

105
00:08:24,923 --> 00:08:30,178
He yanked some teenager out of the window,
threw his wife in the back and took off.

106
00:08:30,261 --> 00:08:31,471
Excuse me.

107
00:08:33,765 --> 00:08:35,600
What do you think?

108
00:08:35,684 --> 00:08:39,562
I'm thinking, while we're here,
I might take a look at Mr Crump's wife.

109
00:08:39,646 --> 00:08:42,774
I'm gonna stay here
and see if I can see Crump.

110
00:08:56,454 --> 00:09:01,501
- Captain? Where's Montello?
- Little town right here.

111
00:09:01,626 --> 00:09:04,838
So that's where it started.
That's Crump's home.

112
00:09:04,963 --> 00:09:08,466
Then he headed east in this direction,

113
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,011
on the 5, about ten miles to the Utah border,
where he stole the car.

114
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:13,346
You got it.

115
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,641
But you caught up with him in Wells.
Where's that?

116
00:09:17,684 --> 00:09:19,978
That's here. He started in this direction,

117
00:09:20,061 --> 00:09:24,524
then all of a sudden he turned around
and he headed west to Wells. Why?

118
00:09:31,364 --> 00:09:34,868
The former Vicky Jenkins Crump.

119
00:09:34,993 --> 00:09:40,331
I'm hoping you can tell me what I'm
looking at, cos this is a new one on me.

120
00:09:55,054 --> 00:09:59,559
There's no gunpowder residue.
No carbon stippling.

121
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,650
There seems to be no evidence
of an entry wound.

122
00:10:07,734 --> 00:10:11,696
There is none. It's all exit.
But how that could be...

123
00:10:22,123 --> 00:10:24,375
I'm finding fragments of petrous bone

124
00:10:24,459 --> 00:10:28,213
embedded in the remaining portion
of the auditory canal.

125
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:32,550
I seem to be looking through to the
osseous labyrinth, or what's left of it.

126
00:10:32,634 --> 00:10:36,054
It's almost like a little bomb
went off in her ear.

127
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:43,061
- May I?
- Please.

128
00:10:50,985 --> 00:10:55,657
Seems to be some kind of tumefaction
within the lateral sinus.

129
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:16,928
(man) Can you give us a little room here?

130
00:11:18,638 --> 00:11:23,142
He just went rammy on me. Accu-Check
is normal. We did a Narcan push.

131
00:11:23,268 --> 00:11:27,063
He keeps getting worse.
IV beta-blocker and topical nitro.

132
00:11:27,146 --> 00:11:30,608
I don't know if you're gonna
get to talk to this fella.

133
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:38,533
Five's a crowd, buddy.

134
00:11:46,499 --> 00:11:49,460
<i>(Siren)</i>

<i>(beeping slows)</i>

137
00:12:02,307 --> 00:12:05,560
Something must have worked.
Heart rate's dropping.

138
00:12:05,643 --> 00:12:08,062
BP's headed south.

139
00:12:08,146 --> 00:12:12,692
- I don't understand. What'd you just do?
- Hell if I know. But I'll take it.

140
00:12:55,693 --> 00:12:57,362
<i>(cellphone ringing)</i>

141
00:12:57,445 --> 00:12:59,197
Come on, Mulder.

142
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:02,700
Hey, you, out! This lab is quarantined! Go!

143
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:08,581
- Mulder?
- Yeah?

144
00:13:08,706 --> 00:13:13,252
Mulder, it's me. You know how
to pick 'em, I'll tell you that.

145
00:13:13,378 --> 00:13:17,173
I have no idea what killed this woman,
but I assume it's communicable.

146
00:13:17,256 --> 00:13:18,132
<i>Yeah?</i>

147
00:13:18,216 --> 00:13:20,802
Another body was found outside of Montello.

148
00:13:20,885 --> 00:13:24,430
Same apparent cause of death:
a massive aneurysmal rupture.

149
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:28,393
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>
- I've called the CDC. They're on their way.

150
00:13:28,476 --> 00:13:31,896
But Patrick Crump may be infected,
so you need to quarantine him,

151
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:37,151
and make sure that anybody who has had
any contact with him is quarantined as well.

152
00:13:37,235 --> 00:13:42,573
And that means you, Mulder. You're to
have no contact with him whatsoever.

153
00:13:42,657 --> 00:13:44,075
Mulder?

154
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:47,161
Well, that's gonna be a little tough, Scully.

155

<i>(Sirens)</i>

156
00:13:56,462 --> 00:13:58,172

<i>(cellphone rings)</i>

158
00:14:11,978 --> 00:14:15,523
- Where are they?
- Route 789, heading west.

159
00:14:15,606 --> 00:14:18,735
We're keeping 'em in visual,
plus we're in phone contact.

160
00:14:18,818 --> 00:14:22,363
Not to mention the strings we pulled
to keep this off local TV.

161
00:14:22,447 --> 00:14:24,699
- Where are they going?
- Crump won't say.

162

he ain't getting there.

- Roadblock?
- East of Tuscarora.

164
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:34,917
- Nice, clean, remote space we can own.
- All right. I want the CDC on site.

165
00:14:35,001 --> 00:14:40,548
I want the officers making the arrest to be
wearing level two anti-contamination suits.

166
00:14:40,631 --> 00:14:44,302
I want the car decontaminated,
also Agent Mulder and Crump,

167
00:14:44,385 --> 00:14:48,639
- and I want them quarantined separately.
- You got it.

168
00:14:57,065 --> 00:15:02,487
Crump says that if we don't pull back
our escort, he's gonna shoot your partner.

169
00:15:04,489 --> 00:15:06,824
Just leave me the hell alone!

170
00:15:08,034 --> 00:15:10,036
Now!

171
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:26,761
How about if we just pull over
and let me out, too, huh?

172
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:30,848
- I must be crampin' your style.
- Just shut up.

173
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,944

Sure.

- It's right here, boy.

Tell me everything.
That's the only way I can help.

194

- You people put me here!
- Shut up!

I'm guessin' we got two miles
before the roadblock.

- What roadblock? I got rid of the cops.
- Check your window.

- They lost 'em.

204
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:10,925
They were last seen
on a forestry service road.

205
00:18:11,008 --> 00:18:13,344
Our helicopter lost sight of 'em.

206
00:18:13,427 --> 00:18:15,930
How did Crump know
to avoid the roadblock?

207
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:17,306
That's the question.

208
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:21,727
I was hoping your Agent Mulder would
manage to steer him toward it, but...

209
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:25,481
Maybe Mulder steered him away from it.

210
00:18:25,564 --> 00:18:30,194
- Why would he do that?
- Maybe he knew something that we don't.

the cell filters from the second victim.

00:18:43,874 --> 00:18:47,712
So far I'm seeing no evidence
of infection in either victim.

214
00:18:51,757 --> 00:18:54,385
So then we're in the clear?

215
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:59,765
No, no, not necessarily.
I mean, something killed these people.

Agent Mulder and I came across
a situation in Nevada,

227
00:19:31,422 --> 00:19:34,383
which we both felt needed
our immediate attention.

228
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:37,553
I eagerly await your report.

229
00:19:37,636 --> 00:19:40,890
In the meantime, agents
of our Las Vegas field office

230
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:44,560
will be available to assist you
in tracking down Agent Mulder.

00:19:44,643 --> 00:19:46,354
Thank you, sir.

232
00:19:46,437 --> 00:19:48,731
Oh, Agent Scully...

233
00:19:48,814 --> 00:19:52,026
At this point, I want to see
him alive even more than you.

234
00:20:10,836 --> 00:20:13,297
Can I see that for a minute?

235
00:20:15,841 --> 00:20:19,637
- This man worked reading meters.
- Yes.

236
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:22,973
What if he read the meter
at Vicky Crump's place?

237
00:20:35,027 --> 00:20:39,490
Crump? Crump, what else can you tell me
about what's happening to you?

238
00:20:40,825 --> 00:20:42,868
Mr Crump.

239
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:46,956
You call me by my last name,
you say "Mr" in front of it.

240
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,460
- "Mr." Gotcha.
- Not Crump. Mr Crump.

241
00:20:51,544 --> 00:20:54,672
I can think of something else
I'd like to call you.

242
00:20:54,755 --> 00:20:58,217
I could put "Mr" in front
of that too, if you'd like.

243
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:06,058
What kind of name is Mulder anyway?
What is that, like... like Jewish?

244
00:21:06,183 --> 00:21:07,560
Excuse me?

- What am I? I'm, like, Quincy?

we went, the better she'd do.

Wait. What are you doing?

335
00:31:23,383 --> 00:31:29,431
The pathology of this thing...
it affects the inner ear.

336
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:32,476
And this area right here is ground zero.

337
00:31:35,479 --> 00:31:39,524

I don't know if there's miscommunication
between you and your Washington office...

384
00:36:02,245 --> 00:36:04,039
My Washington office?

385
00:36:04,122 --> 00:36:08,251
I was under the impression I'd explained
this to the FCC's satisfaction.

386
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:13,757
I'm... I'm so sorry to make you
run through it again, uh...

387
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:17,594
for my official report to the FCC.

388
00:36:17,677 --> 00:36:22,974
At 6.17 yesterday morning, during a test
of our ground conduction radio system,

389
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:27,520
a situation arose in which our equipment
experienced a brief power surge.

390
00:36:27,604 --> 00:36:31,566
That's what interrupted television
reception in the four-state area.

391
00:36:31,649 --> 00:36:34,778
Steps have been taken to ensure
this won't happen again.

392
00:36:34,861 --> 00:36:38,406
The ground conduction radio,
that would be Project Seafarer?

393
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,909
The specifics of what we do are classified.

394
00:36:40,992 --> 00:36:43,119
Sure. Sure.

395
00:36:44,120 --> 00:36:49,000
Would you happen to know what effect
such a surge might have on an organism?

396
00:36:49,125 --> 00:36:51,294
Say, um... say a human being?

397
00:36:53,671 --> 00:36:57,300
- Theoretically speaking.
- Theoretically speaking...

398
00:36:57,384 --> 00:36:59,969
that's classified as well, ma'am.

399
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:08,812
- Cmmp
- Mr Crump.

400
00:37:09,479 --> 00:37:10,897
Mr Crump.

401
00:37:11,898 --> 00:37:14,192
What is it, Mr Mulder?

402
00:37:38,049 --> 00:37:40,301
Mulder. Are you OK?

403
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:44,431
Yeah, aside from cellphone withdrawal,
and I gotta pee. Where are you?

404
00:37:44,514 --> 00:37:49,978

jet. Hopefully, I'll overshoot you.

00:37:50,061 --> 00:37:52,605
<i>- Headed where'?
- I don't know. You tell me.</i>

406
00:37:52,689 --> 00:37:54,816
I'm guessing wherever Route 36 ends,

407
00:37:54,899 --> 00:37:58,778
<i>but we can't stop and I'm kind of
at a loss as to what to do next.</i>

408
00:37:58,862 --> 00:38:01,781
I think I have a loose theory
as to what caused this.

409
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:04,951
- Well, lay it on me.
- OK.

410
00:38:05,034 --> 00:38:07,078
You know what ELF waves are?

411
00:38:07,203 --> 00:38:09,914
Extremely low frequency
radio transmissions?

412
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:12,083
Use an antenna, like, 50 miles long.

413
00:38:12,208 --> 00:38:16,463
The military uses it to communicate with
the Trident submarines - Project Seafarer.

414
00:38:16,546 --> 00:38:21,468
Seafarer has an antenna array stretching
beneath the edge of Crump's property.

415
00:38:21,551 --> 00:38:26,514
Now, ELF fields have been shown to produce
biological effects in human tissue,

416
00:38:26,598 --> 00:38:30,018
<i>inducing electrical currents,
altering chemical reactions.</i>

417
00:38:30,101 --> 00:38:34,564
As a potential weapons application,
it's referred to as electrical nerve gas,

418
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:36,733
or may be behind the Taos Hum.

419
00:38:36,816 --> 00:38:39,694
What if some overload,
some hum from this system,

420
00:38:39,777 --> 00:38:43,198
could somehow match the resonant
frequency of the human skull?

421
00:38:43,281 --> 00:38:45,992
I mean, what if it could induce a like hum

422
00:38:46,075 --> 00:38:52,290
that could somehow exert a rising pressure
on the inner ear, shattering it?

423
00:38:52,415 --> 00:38:56,544
With constant movement ameliorating
that pressure, making it bearable?

424
00:38:56,628 --> 00:39:00,924
- But why only westward movement?
- I don't know, Mulder. I don't know. I mean...

425
00:39:01,007 --> 00:39:05,136
Maybe it follows certain lines of force,
electrical or magnetic.

426
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:08,181
But the big question, Scully,
is what do we do about it?

427
00:39:08,264 --> 00:39:12,268
I think I know, Mulder, but it's nothing
that Mr Crump is gonna like.

428
00:39:20,944 --> 00:39:23,154
We'll be there.

429
00:39:24,113 --> 00:39:25,281
What?

430
00:39:25,365 --> 00:39:30,828
Whether they did this to you intentionally
or not, you were right. They did it to you.

431
00:39:32,455 --> 00:39:34,707
So what do we... what do we do?

432
00:39:36,125 --> 00:39:39,587
Your one chance is that we meet my partner
at the end of the highway.

433
00:39:39,671 --> 00:39:43,132
There she will insert a large-bore needle
into your inner ear,

434
00:39:43,216 --> 00:39:45,510
hopefully relieving the pressure.

435
00:39:45,635 --> 00:39:49,973
When we get there, she'll have to work fast.
She'll only have one chance.

436
00:39:50,056 --> 00:39:55,562
She's not gonna be able to use anaesthetic.
And it will probably leave you deaf.

437
00:39:58,481 --> 00:40:00,984
But I'll live, right?

438
00:40:02,318 --> 00:40:05,780
Well... Well, that's what it's all about.

439
00:40:05,863 --> 00:40:08,491
All right, man. Let's do it.

440
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:18,251
Mr Mulder, could you
go a little faster, please?

441
00:40:18,334 --> 00:40:21,254
- Just a little more is all I need.
- Sure.

442
00:40:28,261 --> 00:40:30,847
Just a little bit faster.
