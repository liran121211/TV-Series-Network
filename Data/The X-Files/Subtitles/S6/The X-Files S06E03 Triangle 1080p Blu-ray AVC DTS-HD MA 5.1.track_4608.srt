Hold on, mates. He's almost up.

That's it. Give him a big pull.

00:02:09,214 --> 00:02:14,219
That's it. Don't drop him now. Come on.
Pull him over. Put your backs into it.

That's what you get for your trouble.

9

10
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,157
(man #5) Yeah, or a short flight.

11
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,783
Are you an airman, mate?

12

Yeah.

16
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:51,256
(man #5) Right. Let's give him the heave-ho.

17

<i>(Mulder) Hey.</i>

18
00:02:56,011 --> 00:02:58,930
How's about another dip

19
00:02:59,056 --> 00:03:00,932
Yeah. Even the sharks won't eat him.

20

Oi! What you got to say for yourself,
Jerry, before we throw you back in?

21

- My name's not Jerry.
- What's that? Eh?

22
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,609
My name's Mulder. Fox Mulder.

23
00:03:10,734 --> 00:03:14,696
- (man #3) Is that a name? Mulder?
- I got ID in my pocket.

24

- Never heard of it?

26

- You've never heard of the FBI?

27

- (Mulder) Where are you taking me?

28
00:03:33,632 --> 00:03:37,969
- (man #3) Where'd you get that accent?
- (man #4) In the Fuhrer's Secret Service.

35
00:04:00,325 --> 00:04:03,078
Aye? What's this about?

36
00:04:03,662 --> 00:04:08,750
We found him in the water, sir. Don't know
nothing about him. I think he's a German.

37
00:04:08,834 --> 00:04:11,503
Bring the prisoner in my room.

38
00:04:17,926 --> 00:04:19,845
Friend or foe?

39
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:21,179
Uh...

40
00:04:21,263 --> 00:04:24,307
- What?
- To what flag do you pledge allegiance?

41
00:04:25,016 --> 00:04:27,853
I think there's been a mistake.

42
00:04:27,978 --> 00:04:31,440
I think the mistake is mine.

43
00:04:31,523 --> 00:04:33,859
- Speak the truth.
- This is the Queen <i>Anne?</i>

44
00:04:33,984 --> 00:04:36,027
- Aye.
- Hey, that's enough of that.

45
00:04:36,153 --> 00:04:39,614
- I came looking for this ship.
- Say the word. I'll make him first.

46
00:04:39,698 --> 00:04:43,368
- Wait. I think I can explain what's going on.
- It's a ruse, Captain.

47
00:04:43,452 --> 00:04:47,205
- What's our current position?
- Cut the spy up.

48
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:50,709
No, I'll tell you. We're two degrees
above the 30th parallel.

49
00:04:50,834 --> 00:04:53,462
Sargasso Sea. Just above
the tropic of Cancer.

50
00:04:53,545 --> 00:04:57,048
64° west by southwest,
off the Plantagenet Bank.

51
00:04:57,174 --> 00:05:02,137
60 miles south-southwest off Bermuda. How
would I know that if I'd been in the water?

52
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:06,975
Aye. That's a damn good question, lad.
I'm waiting for a damn good answer.

53
00:05:07,893 --> 00:05:09,019
Tell me I'm wrong.

54
00:05:09,102 --> 00:05:13,231
Tell me you haven't been
able to get accurate compass readings.

55
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:15,859
It's because you've been caught
in something called the Devil's Triangle.

56
00:05:15,942 --> 00:05:18,069
I can show you.

57
00:05:18,153 --> 00:05:23,158
It goes from Bermuda down
to Puerto Rico, back up to Florida.

58
00:05:23,241 --> 00:05:25,827
The Queen Anne is stuck here
on the eastern edge.

59
00:05:25,911 --> 00:05:29,831
You've been caught in some kind of
time warp, some kind of limbo dimension,

60
00:05:29,915 --> 00:05:32,834
and now you've popped out
the other side into 1998.

61
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:35,170
- 1998?
- This man is mad.

62
00:05:35,253 --> 00:05:40,091
- Let him tell it to the fishes.
- I'm done foolin' about. There's a war on.

63
00:05:40,175 --> 00:05:45,680
And in it or no, I don't plan to lose me mind,
nor me ship, to the likes of a jackal like you.

64
00:05:45,764 --> 00:05:48,850
Well, you can relax. There's no war.
The world is at peace.

65
00:05:48,934 --> 00:05:53,104
There's a little trouble at our White House,
but that'll blow over, so to speak.

66
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:56,858
Peace? It's September 3, 1939, man.

67
00:05:56,942 --> 00:06:01,363
Hitler has entered Poland. We've been
boarded by his goose-stepping hooligans,

68
00:06:01,446 --> 00:06:04,366
so don't speak to me of peace, lad.
Tell Mother England.

69
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:07,869
No, it's not September 3.
It's November 16. Look.

70
00:06:07,953 --> 00:06:10,205
- Excuse me, Captain.
- Aye.

71
00:06:10,288 --> 00:06:13,625
Sir, the Germans, sir.
They've taken control of the bridge.

72
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,127
Steering a course for their homeland.

73
00:06:16,211 --> 00:06:19,714
Not on the watch of Captain
Yip Harburg, they're not.

74
00:06:19,798 --> 00:06:22,467
Lock the prisoner up in here.

75
00:06:22,592 --> 00:06:25,303
It's OK. The war is over.

76
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:28,974

- OK. Where are we going?

165
00:14:48,306 --> 00:14:52,101
- The walls have ears.
- I have ears. Tell me what's going on.

166
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:55,980
- Mulder's disappeared.
- From where?

167
00:14:56,064 --> 00:14:57,690
From the National Reconnaissance Office's

168
00:14:57,774 --> 00:15:02,236
Lacrosse mid-latitude imaging
radar satellite.

169
00:15:04,238 --> 00:15:07,075
- What am I looking at?
- A whole lot of nothin'.

170
00:15:07,158 --> 00:15:09,744
We got that 45 minutes ago
off the NRO satellite

171
00:15:09,827 --> 00:15:14,248
which today sent a picture of a ship
which inexplicably appeared in the Atlantic.

172
00:15:14,332 --> 00:15:18,002
The SS Queen Anne, which, by all accounts,
vanished over 60 years ago.

173
00:15:18,127 --> 00:15:19,587
The British luxury liner.

174
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:22,256
- Right.
- It was torpedoed by a German U-boat.

175
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,342
- That's one story.
- There's another?

176
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:27,678
Though her exact position was
kept a secret for fear of spies

177
00:15:27,762 --> 00:15:32,517
it's thought she was just south of the
Plantagenet Bank when she went missing.

178
00:15:32,642 --> 00:15:35,269
Less than 60 feet of water,
yet she was never found.

179
00:15:35,353 --> 00:15:38,439
- So she just disappeared?
- Into the Bermuda Triangle.

180
00:15:38,523 --> 00:15:41,609
And reappeared this morning
at 6.49am Eastern Standard Time.

181
00:15:41,692 --> 00:15:42,693
Impossible.

182
00:15:42,777 --> 00:15:44,862
- The satellite can't lie.
- It's blank.

183
00:15:44,946 --> 00:15:48,199
We gave the original images
to Mulder for navigational aids.

184
00:15:48,324 --> 00:15:49,951
- He was in a hurry.
- To get where?

185
00:15:50,034 --> 00:15:53,538
- Out to the Queen Anne before anyone else.
- He's gone out here?

186
00:15:53,621 --> 00:15:56,457
He went to Bermuda and
he chartered a powerboat.

187
00:15:56,541 --> 00:16:00,628
- We tracked him on the satellite.
- Until the storm obscured transmissions.

188
00:16:00,711 --> 00:16:02,880
- That's what you have.
- What happened?

189
00:16:02,964 --> 00:16:06,801
We can't know without alternative
tracking data, which is why we're here.

190
00:16:06,884 --> 00:16:08,970
Without data we can only hope for the best.

191
00:16:09,053 --> 00:16:10,388
And expect the worst.

192
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:12,390
We have to get help.

193
00:16:12,473 --> 00:16:14,684
With no position he's a needle in a haystack.

194
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:16,561
What do you need?

195
00:16:17,854 --> 00:16:22,191
Navy AWACS SLAR or
SAR 100k swath imaging.

196
00:16:22,817 --> 00:16:26,404
You're gonna have to find somebody
at the Pentagon to get it.

197
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:28,990
Wait for me downstairs.

198
00:16:36,247 --> 00:16:38,749
- I need to speak with him.
- Could you take a seat?

199
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,251
- Is he in?
- Yes.

200
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:42,670
Sorry. This can't wait.

201
00:16:42,753 --> 00:16:44,338
Sir?

202
00:16:44,422 --> 00:16:47,091
Can you hold on a minute?
What is it, Agent Scully?

203
00:16:47,175 --> 00:16:52,096
I just received some very disturbing
information, sir. I need your help.

204
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:54,932
I'll call you back in five.

205
00:16:56,601 --> 00:17:00,688
- You can't come rushing in here.
- I couldn't waste time explaining myself.

206
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:04,525
- Tell me what is so urgent.
- Mulder's done something incredibly rash.

207
00:17:04,609 --> 00:17:07,028
- I can't.
- He may be lost at sea.

208
00:17:07,111 --> 00:17:08,863
- I can't.
- You can't what?

209
00:17:08,946 --> 00:17:12,783
- Help. There's nothing I can do for you.
- It isn't for me. It's for Mulder.

210
00:17:12,909 --> 00:17:15,536
My hands are tied. I'm not
your direct superior now.

211
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:19,874
- Don't you wanna know what this is about?
- No, I don't. I don't even wanna hear it.

212
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:23,961
- Sir, this is about a man's life.
- I'm not allowed to have contact with you.

213
00:17:24,045 --> 00:17:26,297
Any contact with you or Mulder.

214
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:29,091
She walked right past me, sir.

215
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:35,139
- You're out of line, Scully.
- No, sir, you're out of line.

216
00:17:35,223 --> 00:17:39,644
I'm sorry, but I'm coming to you for help
and I've got nowhere else to go.

217
00:17:39,727 --> 00:17:42,897
I would hope that after everything
you'd have the courtesy,

218
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:47,652
the decency, and not to mention the respect
to listen to what I have to say.

219
00:17:47,735 --> 00:17:50,154
Now, all I need is information.

220
00:17:50,238 --> 00:17:53,157
You don't have to do anything else.

221
00:17:56,327 --> 00:18:02,083
Sir, if you know anybody at the Office of
Naval Intelligence it would be of great help.

222
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:11,008
I could lose my job. My pension.
I could even be subject to legal action.

223
00:18:15,846 --> 00:18:19,016
Use your head, Scully. It'll save your ass.

224
00:18:20,768 --> 00:18:24,522
Save your own ass, sir.
You'll save your head along with it.

225
00:19:04,395 --> 00:19:05,980
Ouch!

226
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:08,190
Sorry.

227
00:19:26,709 --> 00:19:29,670
Yes, sir. I'll get those files
and make that call.

228
00:19:29,754 --> 00:19:32,757
- I need a word with AD Kersh.
- Sorry. He's not available.

229
00:19:32,882 --> 00:19:35,593
Assistant Director Kersh,
may I have a moment?

230
00:19:35,676 --> 00:19:39,430
- A moment for what?
- Uh, may I, sir? Thank you.

231
00:19:42,725 --> 00:19:46,103
Sir, I need you to get me some information.

232
00:19:46,187 --> 00:19:51,609
I am not at liberty to say why but I can
tell you it is of the utmost importance.

233
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:56,238
- Yes?
- I, uh...

234
00:19:57,031 --> 00:20:00,368
Sorry, I shouldn't have come unannounced.

235
00:20:01,619 --> 00:20:04,914
May I see what you were gonna
show me, Agent Scully?

236
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:07,625
Uh...

237
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,461
It... well, it's nothing.

238
00:20:10,586 --> 00:20:12,630
Really.

239
00:20:13,422 --> 00:20:15,466
Good.

240
00:20:34,318 --> 00:20:37,071
What am I thinking? What am I thinking?

241
00:20:40,408 --> 00:20:42,493
Sorry.

242
00:20:52,002 --> 00:20:54,255
Come on, come on, come on.

243
00:20:54,338 --> 00:20:56,674
Answer the phone, Mulder.

244
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,510
Answer the phone. Answer the phone.

245
00:21:03,514 --> 00:21:06,934
<i>The cellular customer you are trying
to reach is not responding.</i>

246
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:09,103
Damn.

247
00:21:14,859 --> 00:21:19,864
I want you to do me a favour. It is not
negotiable. Either you do it or I kill you.

248
00:21:21,866 --> 00:21:23,451
- Are you OK?
- No, I'm not.

249
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:27,371
I'm a gun ready to go off, so don't test me
or think about trying to weasel me.

250
00:21:27,455 --> 00:21:30,458
What is it that you need?

251
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:35,963
Navy AWACS SLAR 100k swath

252
00:21:36,046 --> 00:21:38,966
south-southeast of Bermuda.

253
00:21:39,049 --> 00:21:41,218
I am looking for a boat, maybe a ship.

254
00:21:41,302 --> 00:21:43,637
- 1939 luxury liner.
- 1939?

255
00:21:43,721 --> 00:21:47,224
Don't ask too many questions.
I don't care what you do.

256
00:21:47,308 --> 00:21:50,311
I need that information and
I need it now. Are we clear?

257
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:51,896
Crystal.

258
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:57,485
Agent Spender? If you're not back in a hurry
I'll hunt you down and so help me God...

259
00:21:57,568 --> 00:21:59,653
Right.

260
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,575
God.

261
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:06,744

262
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:15,503

00:22:15,586 --> 00:22:16,587
Yes.

<i>I was looking for Agent Spender.</i>

265
00:22:18,881 --> 00:22:22,593
I'm sorry. He's not here right now.
ls there something I can help with?

266
00:22:22,718 --> 00:22:26,347
<i>Yeah. Agent Scully just gave
the assistant director a piece of paper</i>

267
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:29,391
<i>with an intelligence system scribbled on it.</i>

268
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,186
Yes?

269
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:35,898

271
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:49,703
- Agent Scully.
- I...

272
00:22:49,787 --> 00:22:53,290
- I was sent to fetch you.
- I was waiting for Agent Spender. Uh...

273
00:22:53,374 --> 00:22:55,709
I was supposed to pick up
a delivery from him.

274
00:22:55,793 --> 00:22:59,129
Agent Spender is with
Assistant Director Kersh.

275
00:22:59,255 --> 00:23:01,298
That rat bastard!

276
00:23:10,724 --> 00:23:12,142
Stupid!

278
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:15,729

Mulder, is that you?

281
00:23:22,653 --> 00:23:25,739
No, I can't. I'm on an elevator.

282
00:23:25,823 --> 00:23:28,492
Hold on. I'll be off in a s...

283
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:30,661
Hold on.

<i>- No!

I can't...

289
00:23:49,013 --> 00:23:50,764
- Was that you?
- Is it you?

290
00:23:50,848 --> 00:23:54,977
I've been trying to reach you.
I got the information you needed.

291
00:23:56,353 --> 00:23:58,606
- How?
- Don't even ask.

292
00:23:58,689 --> 00:24:01,108
Sir, what you've done...

293
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:04,153
- ...could save Mulder's ass. I know.
- Thanks.

294
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:08,115
And if you ever ask me to break policy
I will have you written up

295
00:24:08,198 --> 00:24:10,701
and tossed out of the FBI
for good. Understood?

296
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:12,870
Yes, sir.

297
00:24:15,873 --> 00:24:17,958
Yes.

298
00:24:40,731 --> 00:24:43,400
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

299
00:24:55,913 --> 00:24:58,165
Oi! American, right?

300
00:24:58,248 --> 00:25:02,503
Saved your life, mate. Krauts don't want
no reason to bring you Yanks into the war.

301
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:05,756
- I got two words for you - Pearl Harbor.
- What?

302
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:10,010
After Poland, Hitler's off to Denmark,
Holland and France, with a few stopoffs.

303
00:25:10,094 --> 00:25:11,929
The French all but roll over on us.

304
00:25:12,012 --> 00:25:16,600
The Italians seize their opportunity and
the Japanese come through the back door.

305
00:25:16,725 --> 00:25:19,019
It's a long bloody story with a happy ending.

306
00:25:19,103 --> 00:25:20,437
We win?

307
00:25:20,562 --> 00:25:23,440
You come out on the side
of history with help from us.

308
00:25:23,565 --> 00:25:25,609
Not much to apologise
over the next 50 years,

309
00:25:25,693 --> 00:25:28,612
except for maybe the Spice Girls.

310
00:25:28,696 --> 00:25:31,448
<i>Dann mal raus mit euch. Vorwérts.</i>

311
00:25:31,573 --> 00:25:34,451
<i>Worauf wartet ihr? Mach schon. Los.</i>

312
00:25:38,455 --> 00:25:43,127
Well, according to our host
this'll be our new accommodations, lads.

313
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:45,713
You speak German.
What was that shouting about?

314
00:25:45,796 --> 00:25:49,550
They got it in mind that we left America
carrying arms to England.

315
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:50,843
Are we?

316
00:25:50,926 --> 00:25:54,304
Listen. She's drawing 16 feet at 81,000 tons.

317
00:25:54,388 --> 00:25:56,890
We're making 21 knots at full power.

318
00:25:56,974 --> 00:26:00,394
If we got munitions aboard this ship
they weigh but a few stone.

319
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:03,731
But the captain knew something.
He wouldn't give up the wheel.

320
00:26:03,814 --> 00:26:07,651
The Nazis boarded us after
they intercepted a radio communication.

321
00:26:07,776 --> 00:26:10,487
Some kind of codeword
they keep asking about.

322
00:26:10,571 --> 00:26:13,824
Thor's Hammer.
Do you know what that is, mate?

323
00:26:14,658 --> 00:26:17,661
Who goes there? I said who goes there?

324
00:26:18,746 --> 00:26:21,331
Show your faces or
we'll bloody beat them to a stump.

325
00:26:21,457 --> 00:26:24,585
Put your irons down.
It's your own crew, for God's sake.

326
00:26:24,668 --> 00:26:26,920
- What you doing here?
- Having a cup of tea.

327
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:30,841
- What's it look like, you stupid swabbo?
- Then who's steering the boat?

328
00:26:30,966 --> 00:26:34,344
Just some blokes who answer
to the name of Heil Hitler.

329
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:38,599
You ever been to Germany? They'll have
a special affection for the likes of you.

330
00:26:38,682 --> 00:26:42,019
- Yeah, right.
- This ship can't go to Germany.

331
00:26:42,102 --> 00:26:44,521
- Make up your mind, mate.
- I got news for you.

332
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:47,775
You're not carrying munitions.
It's something more deadly.

333
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:50,444
- Thor's Hammer.
- That isn't a weapon. It's a man.

334
00:26:50,527 --> 00:26:54,198
A man who helped build a bomb
that'll win the war for whoever has it.

335
00:26:54,323 --> 00:26:58,827
- You're telling me he's aboard this ship?
- I saw him. In the ballroom.

336
00:27:05,042 --> 00:27:06,126
<i>Was ist los?</i>

337
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:11,006
<i>Sein Name ist Thors Hammer.
Er hat einen Plan, eine Bombe zu bauen.</i>

338
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:14,843
<i>Auf Wiedersehen, mates.</i>

339
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:19,723
What's wrong with you? Don't you know
there are spies everywhere?

340
00:27:19,807 --> 00:27:22,226
Trust no one, man!

341
00:27:22,351 --> 00:27:25,229
We've got to stop this ship! Now!

342
00:27:33,737 --> 00:27:36,698
Hey, you! Who's in charge
of this engine room?

343
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:44,081
Hey, I'm talking to you! Shut her down,
man. We've got to scuttle her now.

344
00:27:44,206 --> 00:27:47,584
- Put some piss in her, boys!
- You heard him! Kill the engines!

345
00:27:47,668 --> 00:27:49,711
There's no other way, swabbo.

346
00:27:49,795 --> 00:27:52,673
You can't get to Germany if you can't steer.

347
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:55,342
Me overriding her.
We steerin' a course for home.

348
00:27:55,425 --> 00:27:58,929
You seen your compass? You can't
get to England going the wrong way.

349
00:27:59,054 --> 00:28:01,765
We're not going to England.
We're going to Jamaica.

350
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:03,433
<i>(cheers)</i>

351
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:07,020
You'll steer her home, you ruffo.
To the home where she belongs!

352
00:28:07,104 --> 00:28:11,692
Listen to me! You can't take this ship
to England. You'll never make it.

353
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:15,529
There's only one place she's going.

354
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:19,283
- Jamaica!
- You can't take the ship to Jamaica either.

355
00:28:19,408 --> 00:28:22,870
The Germans will hunt you down
no matter what course you steer.

356
00:28:22,953 --> 00:28:25,956
Hear now! Hear now! Hear now!
And who you be, boy?

357
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:28,709
- My name's Mulder.
- He wants to go back to America.

358
00:28:28,792 --> 00:28:33,547
No, I don't. I want you to take the ship,
turn it back around the way you came.

359
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:37,467
- Bloody hell! We're halfway home!
- You've got to turn this ship around.

360
00:28:37,551 --> 00:28:40,637
- And what's in that direction?
- The future.

361
00:28:40,762 --> 00:28:43,223
Actually, the past.

362
00:28:43,307 --> 00:28:46,393
- Oh, well, I'm convinced(!)
- I can explain it to you.

363
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:48,604
<i>Du! Der Amerikaner!</i>

364
00:28:50,439 --> 00:28:53,317
<i>Du kommst mit uns. Rauf hier. Mitkommen.</i>

365
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,403
Turn this ship around!
Or Hitler rises, Germany wins

366
00:28:56,486 --> 00:28:59,072
and your children will never
know what freedom is!

367
00:28:59,156 --> 00:29:01,325
<i>Halt's Maul jetzt.</i>

368
00:29:03,327 --> 00:29:06,163
<i>Klappe! Weitergehen!</i>

369
00:29:07,122 --> 00:29:08,582
<i>Links rum.</i>

370
00:29:10,334 --> 00:29:12,419
<i>Na komm, mach schon.</i>

371
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:21,595
<i>Halt! Halt! Stehen bleiben!</i>

372
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:24,181
<i>Stehen bleiben oderich schieBe.</i>

373
00:30:15,232 --> 00:30:17,734
<i>Aufstehen.</i>

374
00:30:17,859 --> 00:30:20,570
<i>Mach schnell! Get up!</i>

375
00:30:27,244 --> 00:30:29,579
<i>Er sagte...</i>

376
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:33,750
<i>Wir haben einen Mann an Bord,
einen Wissenschaftler,</i>

377
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:39,006
<i>der weiB, wie man eine Bombe macht,
die den Krieg gewinnen wird.</i>

378
00:30:39,089 --> 00:30:42,009
<i>Frag ihn, wer dieser Mann ist.</i>

379
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:49,016
There's a scientist on board who can
make a bomb. Who is this man?

380
00:30:49,099 --> 00:30:51,184
I don't know.

381
00:30:51,268 --> 00:30:53,353
<i>Waffe bereit!</i>

382
00:30:56,023 --> 00:30:59,943
<i>Sag ihm, wir werden
einen Passagier umbringen,</i>

383
00:31:01,236 --> 00:31:03,864
<i>furjede falsche Antwon'.</i>

384
00:31:03,947 --> 00:31:08,285
You will answer the question
or we will begin killing passengers.

385
00:31:09,453 --> 00:31:12,122
Which one is the scientist?

386
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:15,042
I don't know.

387
00:31:17,294 --> 00:31:19,421
<i>ErschieB ihn.</i>

388
00:31:34,311 --> 00:31:36,396
<i>(gunshot)</i>

389
00:31:45,655 --> 00:31:49,826
<i>Frag ihn, wie viele Personen
er sterben Iésst.</i>

390
00:31:51,661 --> 00:31:54,498
How many lives are you willing to sacrifice?

391
00:31:57,834 --> 00:32:00,087
None.

392
00:32:00,170 --> 00:32:02,923
Then you have the answer?

393
00:32:06,468 --> 00:32:09,179
<i>Er weigert sich ihn zu nennen.</i>

394
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:12,516
<i>SchieB noch mal!</i>

395
00:32:13,683 --> 00:32:15,811
<i>(gun clicks)</i>

396
00:32:16,978 --> 00:32:18,271
<i>(gunshot)</i>

397
00:32:18,355 --> 00:32:20,607
Stop!

398
00:32:20,690 --> 00:32:25,112
He has no answers. You're killing innocent
people to learn that he knows nothing.

399
00:32:25,195 --> 00:32:29,866
- Shut up! Shut up and move away.
- Listen to me, you little weasel!

400
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:34,037
<i>(Cigarette Smoking Man) Wir haben
unseren néchsten Passagier, eine Dame.</i>

401
00:32:34,162 --> 00:32:36,873
<i>Richte die Waffe auf sie.</i>

402
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:45,507
<i>ErschieB sie, wenn er
die Frage nicht beantwortet.</i>

403
00:32:47,509 --> 00:32:50,053
Answer the question.

404
00:32:50,178 --> 00:32:52,889
I'll answer the question.

405
00:32:57,727 --> 00:33:00,897
<i>(Cigarette Smoking Man)
Beantworte die Frage.</i>

406
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:04,484
That man is the scientist.

407
00:33:19,708 --> 00:33:24,337
(Frohike) Hey, Scully. Scully, you're
not gonna believe this. Get up here.

408
00:33:24,421 --> 00:33:26,506
<i>(Scully)</i> What?

409
00:33:28,008 --> 00:33:31,511
(Frohike) The sky just cleared
and there it was.

410
00:33:31,595 --> 00:33:33,930
<i>(Scully) Is it the Queen Anne?</i>

411
00:33:34,055 --> 00:33:36,099
<i>(Byers) That's her.</i>

412
00:33:37,934 --> 00:33:41,354
- (Scully) I don't believe it.
- (Frohike) Seeing is believing.

413
00:33:45,108 --> 00:33:47,777
<i>(Scully) They've got power.</i>

414
00:33:48,695 --> 00:33:51,364
(Langly) Maybe Mulder's already on board.

415
00:33:51,448 --> 00:33:54,117
<i>(Scully) Let's hope he is.</i>

416
00:33:55,368 --> 00:33:57,537
- You're lying.
- He's telling the truth.

417
00:33:57,621 --> 00:33:59,789
Shut up! Who is the scientist?

418
00:33:59,915 --> 00:34:02,042
I told you. This man is the scientist.

419
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:04,252
<i>Untersuchen!</i>

420
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:16,556
<i>- Frag ihn, wie der Mann heiBt.</i>
- <i>What is the man's</i> name?

421
00:34:17,641 --> 00:34:21,895
John Brown. Ask me again
and I'll knock you down.

422
00:34:21,978 --> 00:34:23,730
- What's his name?
- Puddintame.

423
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:28,151
- Ask me again and I'll tell you the same.
- (man) Wait! Don't shoot.

424
00:34:30,820 --> 00:34:33,823
- I'm the scientist.
- This man's a liar.

425
00:34:35,075 --> 00:34:36,076
I'm the scientist.

426
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,995
Please, tell the truth
before someone else has to die.

427
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:41,164
- I don't know him.
- Don't listen to her.

428
00:34:41,289 --> 00:34:44,834
She is travelling with me to protect me.
She works for the OSS.

429
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,003
<i>Fuhrt diesen Mann ab.</i>

430
00:34:49,172 --> 00:34:51,299
<i>(speaks German)</i>

431
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:53,426
That's great.

432
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:56,179
I don't see you did any better.

433
00:35:03,353 --> 00:35:05,480
<i>ErschieB sie zuerst.</i>

434
00:35:08,149 --> 00:35:10,193
<i>ErschieB alle.</i>

435
00:35:10,986 --> 00:35:13,488
What did he say?

436
00:35:16,866 --> 00:35:19,995
- I think I know what he said.
- You learn fast.

437
00:35:28,461 --> 00:35:30,547
<i>(engines stop)</i>

438
00:35:32,966 --> 00:35:35,885
- What's happening?
- The engine shut down.

439
00:36:56,633 --> 00:36:58,468
<i>- (Mulder) Hey!</i>
- <i>(Scully)</i> What?

440
00:36:58,551 --> 00:37:00,387
- Come with me.
- Why should I?

441
00:37:00,470 --> 00:37:03,640
Cos you're the only one
who can save this ship.

442
00:37:27,747 --> 00:37:29,833
Come on.

443
00:37:32,127 --> 00:37:36,673
<i>Stehen bleiben!
Stehen bleiben oderich erschieBe Sie.</i>

444
00:37:38,341 --> 00:37:42,262
<i>Hénde hoch. Hinter Ihren Kopf.</i>

445
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:45,974
<i>- Machen Sie's!
- Now what, Einstein?</i>

446
00:37:47,684 --> 00:37:50,103
<i>Machen Sie's!</i>

447
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:52,313
<i>(gunshot)</i>

448
00:38:00,363 --> 00:38:03,533
God bless America.
Now get your asses out of here.

449
00:38:25,305 --> 00:38:27,390
<i>(SCUIIy) Byers'?</i>

450
00:38:28,183 --> 00:38:30,226
Langlv?

451
00:38:31,519 --> 00:38:33,563
Frohike?

452
00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:48,036
Come on. Come on.

453
00:38:56,002 --> 00:38:58,505
There you guys are.

454
00:40:02,944 --> 00:40:05,905
- What are you doing?
- Telling you how to save the ship.

455
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:08,324
I can't stay. I gotta get back to history.

456
00:40:08,408 --> 00:40:11,160
- What?
- You gotta rescue it. Wait, listen to me.

457
00:40:11,286 --> 00:40:13,246
The ship's been caught
in something called the Devil's Triangle.

458
00:40:13,329 --> 00:40:16,165
Some kind of time warp.

459
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:17,250
Are you crazy?

460
00:40:17,333 --> 00:40:20,253
Einstein predicts the theoretical possibility.

461
00:40:20,336 --> 00:40:23,089
He also predicts an atomic weapon
to destroy the world.

462
00:40:23,172 --> 00:40:25,091
Yeah? So what?

463
00:40:25,174 --> 00:40:29,846
If you don't go back and convince the crew
to head back into the Devil's Triangle,

464
00:40:29,929 --> 00:40:35,935
everything Einstein predicted will become
true, except for the outcome of history.

465
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:38,980
So if I don't turn this ship around...

466
00:40:39,522 --> 00:40:42,483
In all likelihood, I won't exist.

467
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:46,279
And neither will you.

468
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:50,491
So in case we never meet again...

469
00:41:09,344 --> 00:41:12,055
I was expecting the left.

470
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:16,017
Hey!

471
00:42:13,908 --> 00:42:15,910
(SCU/ly) Mulder?

472
00:42:20,373 --> 00:42:22,458
Mulder, it's me.

473
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:25,795
- Where am I?
- You're in a hospital.

474
00:42:25,878 --> 00:42:27,463
- Oh!
- Lie Still.

475
00:42:27,547 --> 00:42:30,466
I feel... like hell.

476
00:42:31,092 --> 00:42:34,554
I don't blame you. You've been
through the wringer, I'd say.

477
00:42:34,637 --> 00:42:39,392
- What happened to me?
- You did something incredibly stupid.

478
00:42:40,143 --> 00:42:43,896
- What did I do?
- You went looking for a ship, Mulder.

479
00:42:45,815 --> 00:42:48,484
In the Bermuda Triangle.

480
00:42:49,235 --> 00:42:52,280
- Say that again?
- (Frohike) Gilligan awakes.

481
00:42:53,489 --> 00:42:55,742
- You were there.
- Hm?

482
00:42:55,825 --> 00:42:58,077
- You were there, Scully.
- He's delirious.

483
00:42:58,161 --> 00:43:01,080
- And he was there too.
- Right, me and my dog, Toto.

484
00:43:01,164 --> 00:43:05,084
- No, you were there with the Nazis.
- Will you settle down? It's an order.

485
00:43:05,168 --> 00:43:08,838
- Not that he takes orders.
- You saved the world, Scully.

486
00:43:08,963 --> 00:43:12,425
- Yeah. You're right. I did.
- What kind of drugs is he on?

487
00:43:12,508 --> 00:43:14,927
- I want some.
- No, the Queen <i>Anne.</i> I found it.

488
00:43:15,011 --> 00:43:19,515
You were there with Thor's Hammer. I told
you to turn the ship around, then I jumped.

489
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,934
Yeah, I bet you did.
The boat that you were on

490
00:43:22,018 --> 00:43:24,854
was busted into a million pieces.

491
00:43:24,937 --> 00:43:29,442
And as for the Queen Anne,
it was nothing more than a ghost ship.

492
00:43:29,525 --> 00:43:35,490
No, no, no. You and lwere
on that ship, Scully, in 1939.

493
00:43:37,033 --> 00:43:39,410
Get some rest, Mulder,
cos when you get out of here,

494
00:43:39,494 --> 00:43:42,538
I'm gonna kick your butt, by God.

495
00:43:45,666 --> 00:43:48,461
I would never have seen you again.

496
00:43:48,544 --> 00:43:51,214
But you believed me.

497
00:43:52,965 --> 00:43:55,051
In your dreams.

498
00:43:56,511 --> 00:43:59,472
Mulder, I want you to close your eyes,

499
00:43:59,555 --> 00:44:03,392
and I want you to think to yourself
"There's no place like home".

500
00:44:03,476 --> 00:44:05,561
Mm.

501
00:44:07,355 --> 00:44:09,398
Hey, Scully.

502
00:44:13,069 --> 00:44:15,154
Yes?

503
00:44:19,325 --> 00:44:21,494
I love you.

504
00:44:21,577 --> 00:44:23,704
Oh, brother.
