1
00:00:01,545 --> 00:00:06,800
<i>(man) Once upon a time, there was a guy
with the improbable name of Fox Mulder.</i>

2
00:00:07,467 --> 00:00:10,637
<i>He started out life happily enough,
as these things go.</i>

3
00:00:10,721 --> 00:00:13,724
<i>He had parents who loved him,
a cute kid sister.</i>

4
00:00:13,807 --> 00:00:18,478
<i>He had a roof over his head, got all his
flu shots, had all his fingers and toes.</i>

5
00:00:18,562 --> 00:00:20,939
<i>Aside from being stuck
with the name Fox,</i>

6
00:00:21,023 --> 00:00:24,943
<i>which probably taught him
how to fight</i> - <i>or not</i> -

7
00:00:25,027 --> 00:00:27,404
<i>he pretty much led a normal life.</i>

8
00:00:27,821 --> 00:00:32,743
<i>But the worst thing by far, the biggest
kick in the slats this kid Fox ever got,</i>

9
00:00:32,826 --> 00:00:35,120
<i>was what happened to his sister.</i>

10
00:00:35,204 --> 00:00:39,374
<i>One day, she just disappeared.</i>

11
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:43,003
<i>Fox buckled down
and worked his butt off,</i>

12
00:00:43,086 --> 00:00:48,091
<i>graduated top of his class at Oxford,
then top of his class at the FBI Academy.</i>

13
00:00:48,175 --> 00:00:50,802
<i>None of that made up
for his sister, though.</i>

14
00:00:50,886 --> 00:00:53,847
<i>It was just a way of putting her
out of his mind.</i>

15
00:00:53,931 --> 00:00:57,643
<i>Finally, the way I figure it,
he went out of his mind,</i>

16
00:00:57,726 --> 00:00:59,895
<i>and he's been that way ever since.</i>

17
00:00:59,978 --> 00:01:02,439
<i>Fox Mulder pissed away a brilliant career,</i>

18
00:01:02,522 --> 00:01:05,275
<i>lost the respect of supervisors
and friends,</i>

19
00:01:05,359 --> 00:01:07,736
<i>and lives life shaking his fist at the sky</i>

20
00:01:07,819 --> 00:01:11,323
<i>and muttering about conspiracies
to anyone who'll listen.</i>

21
00:01:11,406 --> 00:01:16,745
<i>He's one step away from pushing a baby
carriage filled with tin cans down the street.</i>

22
00:01:16,828 --> 00:01:19,623
<i>But now... all that's gonna change.</i>

23
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:56,326
Tell them the truth, you lying son of a bitch!

24
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,996
He's not me, Scully!

25
00:02:00,497 --> 00:02:02,249
Scully!

26
00:02:02,332 --> 00:02:04,626
Scully, he's not me!

27
00:02:14,136 --> 00:02:16,305
You hate me now, right?

28
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:20,309
Dana, I'm sorry I narked
on you to Kersh, but I...

29
00:02:21,184 --> 00:02:23,937
I was scared you were gonna lose your job.

30
00:02:24,021 --> 00:02:26,690
You did the right thing, Mulder.

31
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:29,109
I did?

32
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:33,613
I've been telling you for years you
should play by the book, haven't I?

33
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,950
Hey, it's the new me.

34
00:03:02,726 --> 00:03:05,812
Hey! You fellas, take... What about these?

35
00:03:06,355 --> 00:03:08,148
Come on! Fellas!

36
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:12,027
<i>(chuckling)</i>

37
00:03:12,986 --> 00:03:15,197
You ain't going nowhere.

38
00:03:16,615 --> 00:03:20,660
You and me have had our asses
officially disappeared.

39
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,129
Looks like we're up fudge creek.

40
00:03:33,673 --> 00:03:37,511
- Who are you?
- Call sign's "Maverick".

41
00:03:37,594 --> 00:03:41,556
Not like I'm gonna be
hot-stickin' it anytime soon.

42
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:47,270
- Are you all right, ma'am?
- "Ma'am"? Kiss my ass, you desk monkey.

43
00:03:53,652 --> 00:03:56,613
Oh! No, no, no!

44
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:05,038
I am Tiger Woods.

45
00:04:10,085 --> 00:04:13,046
So... what did Kersh say?

46
00:04:13,588 --> 00:04:16,174
He said that I was wilful...

47
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,679
insubordinate, and not a team player.

48
00:04:22,431 --> 00:04:26,017
And that the FBI didn't need agents
that weren't team players.

49
00:04:26,101 --> 00:04:28,562
What a jerk. Then what?

50
00:04:29,229 --> 00:04:33,150
- Two-week suspension without pay.
- You're not serious!

51
00:04:34,609 --> 00:04:37,320
Who does he think he is?!

52
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,365
See you in two weeks.

53
00:04:41,992 --> 00:04:43,743
Dana?

54
00:04:45,245 --> 00:04:49,708
Do you suppose a home-cooked meal
might ease the pain a little?

55
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,918
Say, my place? 8.00?

56
00:05:09,186 --> 00:05:11,897
I think she likes me, Tiger.

57
00:05:12,606 --> 00:05:17,736
So there I am with this wet-behind-the-ears
RIO flying back seat,

58
00:05:17,986 --> 00:05:22,866
and I'm thinking "Hell, man, I'm gonna
give this cherry the ride of his life."

59
00:05:23,992 --> 00:05:26,119
So I'm putting the spurs to her,

60
00:05:26,203 --> 00:05:29,998
and I'm doing a little hassling
with my wing man Buzzsaw.

61
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:32,042
- Now...
- Would you mind...?

62
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:36,296
Hold up. Buzzsaw gets on my zero.
He's right on my zero.

63
00:05:36,922 --> 00:05:39,591
- And when he gets on your zero...
- Maverick...

64
00:05:39,674 --> 00:05:42,511
- It's like a damn dog tick.
- Maverick...

65
00:05:42,594 --> 00:05:45,222
You ain't shaking that son of a gun.

66
00:05:45,305 --> 00:05:49,226
Hey, Grandma Top Gun!
Will you shut the hell up?

67
00:05:54,481 --> 00:05:57,025
You're my bitch now, pencil neck!

68
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:10,539
General Wegman wants to see you.

69
00:06:18,004 --> 00:06:22,842
Son? You got a set on you,
I'll say that much.

70
00:06:22,926 --> 00:06:27,180
You had us fooled. Why didn't you tell us
what you were doin' from the start?

71
00:06:28,181 --> 00:06:30,976
- Meaning...?
- It's the wrong one.

72
00:06:32,185 --> 00:06:35,438
You replaced the flight data recorder.
This one's from...

73
00:06:35,522 --> 00:06:38,275
It's a scrapped F-111, sir. It's junk.

74
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:41,820
You gave the FBI the wrong
flight data recorder. Why?

75
00:06:41,945 --> 00:06:47,701
Morry... if you were runnin' a scam on
the FBI, why didn't you let us in on it?

76
00:06:50,036 --> 00:06:52,831
I didn't know if I could trust you.

77
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:58,628
We have a security leak, gentlemen,
and for all I knew, it was one of you.

78
00:06:58,712 --> 00:07:03,300
That's why I approached Agent Scully alone,
to find out who her contact is.

79
00:07:03,383 --> 00:07:08,471
Unfortunately, her partner Agent Mulder
screwed everything up.

80
00:07:08,555 --> 00:07:10,640
So why didn't you tell us all this?

81
00:07:10,724 --> 00:07:15,437
I knew that you wouldn't believe it
until you figured it out for yourself.

82
00:07:16,605 --> 00:07:22,193
- So, the real flight data recorder is safe?
- Oh, yeah, absolutely.

83
00:07:22,277 --> 00:07:27,532
- And you will bring it back?
- Of course.

84
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:30,619
By God, you do got a set on you!

85
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:35,165
I wish I could say that
about some of your colleagues.

86
00:07:35,248 --> 00:07:38,335
About those who proffer
rumour and innuendo.

87
00:07:38,418 --> 00:07:42,672
- Those who make dangerous accusations.
- Morris's behaviour supported...

88
00:07:42,756 --> 00:07:46,259
You can explain yourself
to the review panel in Washington.

89
00:07:46,343 --> 00:07:51,264
I've already wired them recommending
censure for your actions.

90
00:07:51,598 --> 00:07:55,310
You're lucky I didn't throw you
in the stockade.

91
00:08:11,368 --> 00:08:13,370
Uh-huh.

92
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:29,302
A little mood lighting for the bedroom.

93
00:08:32,764 --> 00:08:34,849
No bedroom?

94
00:08:51,157 --> 00:08:54,119
This guy hasn't been laid in ten years.

95
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:29,654
Hey, Chris. Hey, I like the, uh...
the, uh... the nose thing.

96
00:09:29,738 --> 00:09:32,115
Ouch! As if!

97
00:09:35,827 --> 00:09:40,206
Terry! Buddy! Hey, Terence.
Sorry. How's it goin'?

98
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,793
Mom says she's taking out
a restraining order on you.

99
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:10,904
- What are you doing back?
- Joanne...

100
00:10:11,154 --> 00:10:15,366
- Your stuff is all outside. Get out.
- There's something I gotta tell you.

101
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:17,994
I've heard enough from you
for one lifetime.

102
00:10:18,077 --> 00:10:21,039
Go tell it to that tramp of yours, that Scully.

103
00:10:21,122 --> 00:10:23,708
Dana Scully. Special Agent Dana Scully.

104
00:10:23,792 --> 00:10:26,377
- Special tramp Dana Scully!
- She's my partner.

105
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:30,507
- I'm supposed to be your partner.
- My name is not Morris Fletcher.

106
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:34,594
It's Fox Mulder.
Special Agent Fox Mulder with the FBI.

107
00:10:34,677 --> 00:10:39,682
Dana Scully is my FBI partner.
I am not your husband. We are not married.

108
00:10:39,766 --> 00:10:44,103
We are strangers, and I have a whole
other life that I'm trying to get back to.

109
00:10:44,187 --> 00:10:47,565
You know, Morris, most men,
when they have a midlife crisis,

110
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:49,818
they buy themselves a sports car.

111
00:10:49,901 --> 00:10:52,529
They don't run around
calling themselves Fox!

112
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:58,076
I want you to look out the window.
Will you just look out the window with me?

113
00:11:00,036 --> 00:11:02,372
You see that car down there?

114
00:11:02,872 --> 00:11:05,792
See the two men in it?
They're surveilling me.

115
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:08,127
They're spying on me.

116
00:11:08,211 --> 00:11:14,050
I don't know if Morris told you, but he has a
very dangerous job. Those men think I'm him.

117
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,969
Only, they don't trust me.

118
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:20,181
One false move and I'm history. Which means
your husband will also be history,

119
00:11:20,265 --> 00:11:24,644
because I won't be able to get back and set
things the way they're supposed to be.

120
00:11:27,897 --> 00:11:30,400
Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

121
00:11:32,443 --> 00:11:37,448
Morris... if you don't like the man
you've become, I don't blame you one bit.

122
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:41,369
But this flight from reality isn't the answer.

123
00:11:42,662 --> 00:11:46,291
Accept who you are,
however repulsive that may be!

124
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,719
Perfect timing.

125
00:11:57,802 --> 00:12:00,847
- Welcome.
- Wow, Mulder.

126
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:02,807
<i>(Morris) You</i> like, <i>huh?</i>

127
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,229
Yeah, I thought it was just time
I stopped livin' like a frat boy.

128
00:12:08,313 --> 00:12:10,523
Come on, see the rest of the place.

129
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:16,696
Through there.

130
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:28,791
- I didn't even know you had a bedroom.
- Oh, yeah.

131
00:12:28,875 --> 00:12:33,713
Yeah, gotta have someplace to lounge
around, read the Sunday New York Times.

132
00:12:34,422 --> 00:12:38,426
- Uh, no, that's OK. No thanks.
- Seriously. Just check it out.

133
00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:41,596
Seriously.

134
00:12:42,889 --> 00:12:45,266
<i>(both)</i> Ohh!

135
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:48,144
- Oh! Uh-oh.
- Whoa!

136
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:49,354
Mulder.

137
00:12:49,437 --> 00:12:53,608
Maybe I like to read the
New York <i>Times</i> backwards.

138
00:12:54,192 --> 00:12:56,361
Do you hate it?

139
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:59,989
No, I don't hate it.

140
00:13:00,073 --> 00:13:02,325
Well, all right, then.

141
00:13:02,408 --> 00:13:04,494
Uh, don't go away.

142
00:13:11,542 --> 00:13:14,253
<i>(deep voice) Let's get it on</i>

143
00:13:14,337 --> 00:13:17,131
<i>(high voice) Let's get it on</i>

144
00:13:17,215 --> 00:13:18,925
<i>(deep voice) Let's get it on</i>

145
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:21,761
<i>(high voice) Let's get it on</i>

146
00:13:21,844 --> 00:13:25,598
<i>(deep voice) Tonight is the night</i>

147
00:13:28,935 --> 00:13:30,937
<i>(laughs)</i>

148
00:13:38,236 --> 00:13:42,031
- You know what would really be fun?
- What?

149
00:13:46,577 --> 00:13:48,663
Oh, yeah.

150
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:51,791
- Me first?
- You first.

151
00:13:57,505 --> 00:13:59,841
Feels like my first time.

152
00:14:05,722 --> 00:14:07,890
Now what?

153
00:14:07,974 --> 00:14:10,309
- You're not Mulder.
- What?!

154
00:14:12,437 --> 00:14:13,396
Baby...

155
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:16,357
"Baby" me and you'll be peeing
through a catheter.

156
00:14:16,441 --> 00:14:20,278
You are Morris Fletcher. It was Mulder
who was arrested in the desert.

157
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:22,905
He was telling the truth about you.

158
00:14:22,989 --> 00:14:25,908
Now how do we get things
back to normal?

159
00:14:29,829 --> 00:14:33,958
How should I know?
I wouldn't do it even if I could.

160
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:36,461
You saw my wife.
You think I wanna go back?

161
00:14:36,544 --> 00:14:39,714
Two kids who'd kill me in my sleep
for the insurance money.

162
00:14:39,797 --> 00:14:43,468
A $400,000 mortgage on a house
that just appraised at 226.

163
00:14:43,551 --> 00:14:49,015
And my job. Ye gods! You think being
a Man in Black is all voodoo mind control?

164
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:51,976
- You should see the paperwork.
- Are you through?

165
00:14:53,019 --> 00:14:56,272
As far as I'm concerned,
this thing is a gift from heaven.

166
00:14:57,732 --> 00:15:01,110
No one's ever gonna believe you,
so get used to me being here.

167
00:15:01,277 --> 00:15:04,447
Or, I just shoot you... baby.

168
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:07,825
I'm telling you, I have no idea
how to change things back!

169
00:15:07,909 --> 00:15:11,120
What about Mulder's source,
the man he was supposed to meet?

170
00:15:11,204 --> 00:15:13,581
Do you know how to get in touch with him?

171
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:17,752
I don't know anything about that.
Sorry, you're out of luck.

172
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:19,921
<i>(phone rings)</i>

173
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:24,175
<i>(Morris's voice on answering machine)
Hello, I'm busy entertaining.</i>

174
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:27,303
<i>- Leave a message and I'll get back to you.
- (beep)</i>

175
00:15:27,386 --> 00:15:29,806
<i>(man) I'm trying you one last time.</i>

176
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:34,352
<i>Are you or are you not interested in the
classified information I have to give you?</i>

177
00:15:34,435 --> 00:15:37,730
<i>Please pick up the phone if you're there.</i>

178
00:15:37,814 --> 00:15:41,859
<i>- Mulder.
- Agent Mulder, listen very carefully.</i>

179
00:15:46,697 --> 00:15:48,783
<i>(door closes)</i>

180
00:15:53,871 --> 00:15:57,708
Well, I guess we've given
the neighbours enough to talk about.

181
00:16:00,419 --> 00:16:05,258
At first you couldn't wait to get away from
me, and now you won't leave the house.

182
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:10,096
Where can we go?

183
00:16:10,847 --> 00:16:13,683
- What do you mean?
- You're right.

184
00:16:13,766 --> 00:16:17,228
We should get out of the house.
Go someplace with a lot of people.

185
00:16:17,395 --> 00:16:20,439
- Someplace with a lot of people?
- Mm-hm.

186
00:16:20,565 --> 00:16:24,193
- In Rachel, Nevada?
- What do you say?

187
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:39,292
Let's run through this one more time.

188
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,752
I'll go in there alone, like you told me to.

189
00:16:41,836 --> 00:16:45,464
He'll be wearing a blue Buffalo Bills cap.

190
00:16:45,673 --> 00:16:46,799
And?

191
00:16:47,717 --> 00:16:51,888
And if I try and slip out the back door,
da-da-da, dee-dee-dee.

192
00:16:51,971 --> 00:16:55,349
- Get going.
- Can't we start over?

193
00:16:55,433 --> 00:16:59,228
Do that thing with the handcuffs?
Maybe... Probably not your scene.

194
00:17:07,737 --> 00:17:13,910
<i>I have waited for
what seems like a whole light year</i>

195
00:17:15,995 --> 00:17:21,250
<i>Just to see your face
once again, my dear</i>

196
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:26,839
<i>Shiny bright light
Moonlight</i>

197
00:17:26,923 --> 00:17:30,468
<i>Sunlight, starlight</i>

198
00:17:31,636 --> 00:17:36,474
<i>With big, dark eyes
that send me out of sight</i>

199
00:17:37,391 --> 00:17:40,311
<i>Now I'm staring at...</i>

200
00:17:41,604 --> 00:17:44,774
- Expecting someone?
- No, I'm not expecting someone.

201
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:47,860
Because if you're here
expecting someone, tell me now,

202
00:17:47,944 --> 00:17:50,112
so I can divorce you and take the house.

203
00:17:50,738 --> 00:17:53,449
Joanne, have another white wine.

204
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:03,584
You're the guy?

205
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:07,380
Sit down.

206
00:18:09,507 --> 00:18:11,926
Well, I'll be damned!

207
00:18:14,387 --> 00:18:17,223
Whoa. Ooh!
God, that beer went right through me.

208
00:18:17,306 --> 00:18:19,558
I gotta... I got... I'll be right back.

209
00:18:19,642 --> 00:18:23,437
- You sabotaged a UFO.
- Keep your voice down.

210
00:18:24,438 --> 00:18:27,483
I didn't intend for it to crash, Agent Mulder.

211
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:30,987
I just meant to disable the stealth module
so you could see it.

212
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,877
- Scully.
- Mulder?

213
00:18:48,254 --> 00:18:52,258
- Is that really you?
- What are you doin' here?

214
00:18:53,217 --> 00:18:55,678
I'm tryin' to figure out a way to help you.

215
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:07,940
- What are you, disgruntled?
- You make me sound like some postal clerk.

216
00:19:08,607 --> 00:19:11,902
What you came for
is on the floor by your feet.

217
00:19:24,123 --> 00:19:26,125
Morris?

218
00:19:42,892 --> 00:19:47,188
<i>In my memory, you are moonlight</i>

219
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:49,648
<i>Starlight</i>

220
00:19:49,732 --> 00:19:54,987
<i>With big, dark eyes
that send me out of sight</i>

221
00:19:55,863 --> 00:20:00,242
<i>Now I'm starin' at the stars</i>

222
00:20:00,326 --> 00:20:03,913
<i>Wonderin' where you are</i>

223
00:20:03,996 --> 00:20:09,585
<i>Wonderin' if I'll ever see your face again</i>

224
00:20:10,378 --> 00:20:14,340
<i>Now I'm starin' at the stars</i>

225
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:18,636
<i>Wonderin' where you are...</i>

226
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:20,554
Joanne?

227
00:20:20,638 --> 00:20:22,890
Hey, how's it goin'?

228
00:20:22,973 --> 00:20:27,520
- Listen, have you seen Morry?
- You bet I've seen him.

229
00:20:34,193 --> 00:20:37,613
Hey, hey! Whoa, whoa! Guys! Guys!

230
00:20:37,822 --> 00:20:41,575
- What the hell was that, Morry?
- I guess I make a lousy husband.

231
00:20:43,994 --> 00:20:46,497
Listen, I'll talk to her.

232
00:21:10,229 --> 00:21:12,523
So you're the guy that wants my life.

233
00:21:15,234 --> 00:21:18,612
I assume that includes
all the ass-kickings?

234
00:21:18,696 --> 00:21:21,490
- Oh, no. You don't wanna do this!
- Yeah, I do.

235
00:21:21,574 --> 00:21:23,033
- Jeff's outside!
- So what?

236
00:21:23,117 --> 00:21:25,453
If he sees us together, we're both dead!

237
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:28,247
Especially when he sees this.

238
00:21:34,336 --> 00:21:36,046
Take that to Scully.

239
00:21:36,505 --> 00:21:40,676
You must have some sort
of waxy build-up. I said Jeff's here!

240
00:21:40,759 --> 00:21:44,763
No way am I going out there
until he leaves. You sneak it past him.

241
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:47,099
- You're his buddy.
- His buddy?

242
00:21:47,183 --> 00:21:49,935
He doesn't trust me
as far as he could throw me!

243
00:21:56,901 --> 00:21:59,153
Oh, jeez.

244
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:21,675
<i>- (Mulder) Hey.
- Hey.</i>

245
00:22:33,979 --> 00:22:35,481
- Jeff.
- General VVegman.

246
00:22:35,564 --> 00:22:37,775
You men, come with me.

247
00:22:45,157 --> 00:22:49,578
- Sir? What are we, uh...
- There. Detain that man.

248
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:53,499
Morris! Stop!

249
00:22:57,127 --> 00:22:58,796
Hey, guys.

250
00:23:02,758 --> 00:23:08,180
- What's in the bag, Morris?
- It's, uh... beer.

251
00:23:08,264 --> 00:23:11,809
- You sure it's not a flight data recorder?
- No, it's beer.

252
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,752
<i>(chuckles)</i>

253
00:23:38,836 --> 00:23:40,754
Suckers.

254
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:50,264
Mmm. More huevos rancheros.

255
00:23:52,725 --> 00:23:56,562
<i>- Més huevos rancheros.
- Por favor.</i>

256
00:23:56,645 --> 00:23:58,397
<i>(knock on door/buzzer)</i>

257
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,566
<i>(Scully) Open up!</i>

258
00:24:16,832 --> 00:24:19,501
(Frohike) I should have made more salsa.

259
00:24:19,585 --> 00:24:22,713
- <i>(Scully) We need</i> your <i>help.</i>
- <i>(Langly) Who crashed?</i>

260
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:28,802
Who, what, why. We need to know
everything that's on that data recorder.

261
00:24:30,137 --> 00:24:34,642
It's similar in size and shape
to the FDRs on the SR-71.

262
00:24:36,935 --> 00:24:40,064
(Frohike) That's definitely
not standard issue.

263
00:24:42,191 --> 00:24:45,903
- Where did you get this?
- Groom Lake. Outside Area 51.

264
00:24:45,986 --> 00:24:48,656
- Dreamland.
- The Aurora spy plane.

265
00:24:49,948 --> 00:24:54,578
- What's that?
- Black world. A Skunk Works special.

266
00:24:54,662 --> 00:24:59,458
Aurora is a hypersonic reconnaissance
aircraft fuelled with slush hydrogen.

267
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:02,044
- Or methylcyclohexane.
- <i>(sniggers)</i>

268
00:25:07,424 --> 00:25:10,552
- What's with him?
- (Morris) You guys like the name?

269
00:25:10,636 --> 00:25:13,764
I wanted to go with either
"Aurora" or "Borealis".

270
00:25:16,058 --> 00:25:19,061
- What the hell's he talkin' about?
- Mulder?

271
00:25:19,144 --> 00:25:20,979
- He's not Mulder.
- Huh?

272
00:25:25,359 --> 00:25:30,489
We think the crash of this particular
aircraft, whatever it was,

273
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:32,533
resulted in a, uh...

274
00:25:39,623 --> 00:25:43,377
My name is Morris Fletcher.
I work inside Area 51.

275
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:47,339
I assumed Mulder's identity through
a warp in the space-time continuum.

276
00:25:59,893 --> 00:26:02,646
Trust me, little man, I ain't him.

277
00:26:04,148 --> 00:26:07,985
I love you guys. I really do.
You're the Lone Gunmen, aren't ya?

278
00:26:08,068 --> 00:26:10,863
You guys are my heroes.
Look at this crap you print.

279
00:26:10,946 --> 00:26:13,073
- We uncover the truth.
- The truth?

280
00:26:13,157 --> 00:26:15,325
That's what's great about you monkeys.

281
00:26:15,409 --> 00:26:19,621
Not only do you believe this horse pucky
we create, you broadcast it as well.

282
00:26:19,705 --> 00:26:20,706
Look at this.

283
00:26:22,082 --> 00:26:24,126
There is no Saddam Hussein!

284
00:26:25,753 --> 00:26:29,423
He's John Gillnitz. We found him
doing dinner theatre in Tulsa.

285
00:26:29,506 --> 00:26:32,926
He did a mean <i>King</i> and I.
Plays good ethnics.

286
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:35,512
You're saying Hussein's
a government plant?

287
00:26:35,596 --> 00:26:39,683
I'm saying I invented the guy.
We set him up in '79.

288
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:43,187
He rattles his sabre whenever
we need a good distraction.

289
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:48,275
If you boys only knew how many of your
stories I dreamed up sitting on the pot.

290
00:26:48,609 --> 00:26:52,070
- What stories?
- Oh, I'm sorry, Melvin. That's classified.

291
00:26:52,154 --> 00:26:55,115
Name's Frohike.
What the hell did you do with Mulder?

292
00:26:55,199 --> 00:26:56,950
Shut up, all of you.

293
00:26:57,034 --> 00:27:00,245
If you guys want Mulder back,
get me these results.

294
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,749
<i>(mouths) Wow.</i>

295
00:27:05,626 --> 00:27:07,419
<i>(knock on door)</i>

296
00:27:07,503 --> 00:27:09,963
- Who is it?
- (Mulder) Morris Fletcher.

297
00:27:10,047 --> 00:27:11,173
Come in.

298
00:27:14,176 --> 00:27:17,805
We shouldn't be seen together.
Not after last night.

299
00:27:17,888 --> 00:27:22,810
- Fletcher, Mulder, whoever you are.
- I'm hoping this will be our last meeting.

300
00:27:22,893 --> 00:27:27,147
Agent Scully's flying back with the analysis
of that flight data recorder.

301
00:27:27,231 --> 00:27:29,650
It'll be too late to save me.

302
00:27:29,733 --> 00:27:32,110
Now that Morris knows you're the leak.

303
00:27:32,194 --> 00:27:37,741
Once you get back - if you get back -
he'll have me arrested, disappeared.

304
00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:41,787
Even if he doesn't, his colleagues
will figure out soon enough.

305
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:45,916
- I sabotaged that craft.
- Why'd you do it?

306
00:27:45,999 --> 00:27:50,337
I didn't mean for it to crash.
I just wanted you to see it.

307
00:27:52,548 --> 00:27:54,174
Well, why?

308
00:27:56,301 --> 00:28:01,682
<i>(sighs)</i> There comes a time when
you look back instead of forward.

309
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:04,393
See the sum of your life.

310
00:28:04,476 --> 00:28:07,980
My career has been spent hiding
the truth from the people,

311
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:11,400
destroying, in a way,
that which was most precious to me.

312
00:28:11,942 --> 00:28:13,777
What is the truth?

313
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:21,201
- You mean... you don't know?
- Don't know what?

314
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:24,997
The truth. What is going
on here at Area 51?

315
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,457
What are these black-budget projects?

316
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:31,253
We fly these birds. They don't say
what makes 'em go.

317
00:28:31,336 --> 00:28:33,839
They engineer 'em all up in Utah.

318
00:28:37,134 --> 00:28:40,554
If you don't know, Why'd you call me?

319
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:45,642
Why... I've seen your file.
You've chased flying saucers for years.

320
00:28:49,313 --> 00:28:52,691
Do aliens really exist, Agent Mulder?

321
00:28:58,572 --> 00:29:01,491
- <i>(Frohike) Something's c: omin' up.
<i>- (Byers) Got it.</i>

322
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:05,621
- What is it?
- We broke the encryption.

323
00:29:05,704 --> 00:29:10,208
This records the telemetry of 28 systems,
including airspeed and fuselage torque.

324
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:13,795
Yeah, all the usual readouts,
but, uh... what are these?

325
00:29:13,879 --> 00:29:17,466
<i>(Byers)</i> "Tachyon flux.
Gravitational displacement."

326
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:22,179
Aurora, my ass. What have you guys

327
00:29:22,262 --> 00:29:24,264
I want you guys to analyse that data.

328
00:29:25,891 --> 00:29:26,934
Morris.

329
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:29,394
- This is one of mine.
- Get your butt in gear.

330
00:29:29,478 --> 00:29:32,022
- You're gonna miss me.
- Fat chance!

331
00:29:32,105 --> 00:29:34,691
- Back off, Sneezy.
- Enough!

332
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:38,904
Call me when you guys
have some answers.

333
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:42,741
Far-out!

334
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:49,414
- The black mailbox!
- (man) Dude, that's a white mailbox.

335
00:29:49,498 --> 00:29:55,337
No, they painted it white to hide it.
This is the black mailbox.

336
00:29:55,420 --> 00:30:01,009
The best place to see Freedom Mountain
and the UFOs over Dreamland, man.

337
00:30:01,301 --> 00:30:07,057
I know a guy who saw five in one night.
He said they danced in the sky.

<i>(low rumbling)</i>

339
00:30:10,644 --> 00:30:14,231
- You guys hear <i>that?</i>
<i>- (low rumbling continues)</i>

340
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:17,359

343
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:30,122

You don't look too happy.

346
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:28,263
Don't tell me I'm gonna have
to put two kids through school.

347
00:31:29,598 --> 00:31:32,601
That is you in there, Mulder, isn't it?

348

<i>(sighs)</i>

349
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:42,861
I, uh... I just got off the phone with Frohike.

350
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:49,159
They were able to download
and analyse the crash data,

351
00:31:49,242 --> 00:31:52,287
and yes, there was
an anomalous event that night.

352
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:55,624
- And how do I get back?
- Well, that's just it.

353
00:31:57,375 --> 00:32:02,089
It's all about random moments in time,
about a series of variables

354
00:32:02,172 --> 00:32:04,257
approaching an event horizon.

355
00:32:04,341 --> 00:32:08,095
And even if we could
recreate that moment,

356
00:32:08,178 --> 00:32:11,139
if we could sabotage another craft...

357
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:15,018
Mulder, if we were... if we were off...

358
00:32:15,102 --> 00:32:19,481
If the event were off
by even one millisecond...

359
00:32:19,689 --> 00:32:22,943
I might wind up with my head in a rock.

360
00:32:24,236 --> 00:32:26,738
Something like that, yeah.

361
00:32:38,416 --> 00:32:43,588
What about him? I mean, me.
Whatever. Whoever he is.

362
00:32:43,672 --> 00:32:46,883
Agent Mulder has become
AD Kersh's new golden boy.

363
00:32:48,468 --> 00:32:54,057
He's been tasked with returning the
flight data recorder that he and I stole.

364
00:32:54,933 --> 00:33:00,272
The son of a bitch confesses to Kersh
even more than I do to my priest.

365
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:04,860
- I'm just tagging along for the ride.
- What do you mean, just tagging along?

366
00:33:05,735 --> 00:33:07,821
I'm out of the Bureau.

367
00:33:09,281 --> 00:33:11,992
I've been censured
and relieved of my position.

368
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:16,746
No. You can explain it to them like you
explained it to me. You have the data.

369
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:20,250
You can make them understand.
You can get your job back.

370
00:33:25,797 --> 00:33:28,133
I'd kiss you if you weren't so damn ugly.

Take a picture. It'll last longer.

373
00:33:38,935 --> 00:33:44,399
If I... shoot him, is that murder or suicide?

374
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:47,819
Neither, if I do it first.

375
00:34:07,756 --> 00:34:09,758

You gotta help me! You gotta help me!
Open the window, please.

381
00:34:58,598 --> 00:35:01,851
I need to talk to you.
Please, I need somebody to help me.

382
00:35:01,935 --> 00:35:05,230
This thing... it was like a... like a wave.

383
00:35:05,313 --> 00:35:08,108
Like... like, all squiggly and everything.

384
00:35:09,484 --> 00:35:13,238
And... and their faces,
they... they stuck together.

385
00:35:13,321 --> 00:35:17,742
And... and her arm,
it was coming through his chest!

386
00:35:21,454 --> 00:35:25,041
Sam, man. Where you been?
Who's the dude?

387
00:35:27,335 --> 00:35:30,505
I swear, man. They were messed up.

388
00:35:32,674 --> 00:35:34,843
I believe you.

389
00:35:45,854 --> 00:35:48,773
So the motel guy wants cash.
He won't take a credit card.

390
00:35:48,857 --> 00:35:53,278
So then it hits me. I flash him my badge:
"Fox Mulder, FBI".

391
00:35:54,404 --> 00:35:58,450
I tell him we're investigating
crappy motels in the Southwest,

392
00:35:58,533 --> 00:36:00,785
so he'd better watch his behind.

393
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:05,457
The guy gives me the room for free, and
he throws in a six-pack of brews to boot.

394
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,876
I love this job!

395
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:16,134
Listen, Dana, after we return
this flight recorder,

396
00:36:16,217 --> 00:36:20,638
what do you say I have a word with the
big man? See if I can get you your job back?

397
00:36:20,805 --> 00:36:24,809
We could have lots of fun together
once you got to know me.

398
00:36:24,893 --> 00:36:28,271
- You know that?
- I've still got my gun.

399
00:36:28,813 --> 00:36:30,857
All right already.

400
00:36:31,358 --> 00:36:33,777
Wait a second. Hold on.

401
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:35,153
- Back up.
- What is it?

402
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:36,738
Back up!

403
00:37:03,264 --> 00:37:05,475
Can I help you, ma'am?

404
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:11,314
I don't understand.
This place was burned to the ground.

405
00:37:11,481 --> 00:37:13,900
I don't think so.

406
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:15,693
Yeah.

407
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:17,904
This place, two nights ago.

408
00:37:17,987 --> 00:37:20,490

I told you. I'm not your husband.
This man is.

You come here to watch my family fall apart?
You getting a big kick out of that?!

418

Get the hell off my porch!

424
00:39:05,678 --> 00:39:11,601
We got married on June 13, 1978.
It rained that day.

425
00:39:11,684 --> 00:39:16,564
You got mad at the reception cos I said
I couldn't see the cake behind your fat ass.

426
00:39:21,736 --> 00:39:26,658
You remember our first apartment?
That dump in Pentagon City?

427
00:39:26,741 --> 00:39:30,328
You'd turn the air conditioner on,
lights would go out?

428
00:39:30,995 --> 00:39:35,416
Or when you were pregnant, how I'd tickle
your kneecaps to make you laugh?

429
00:39:36,584 --> 00:39:39,712
Remember?
Remember the night Chrissy was born?

430
00:39:41,422 --> 00:39:44,676
And I held her in my arms,
all red-faced and screaming?

431
00:39:44,759 --> 00:39:48,137
That's the only time I ever saw you cry.

00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:52,433
Oh, my God.

Where are you taking him?

00:40:02,068 --> 00:40:07,365
We have reason to believe that whatever
event caused this may be reversing.

438
00:40:07,448 --> 00:40:10,868

to the spot where this all began.

439

Now it's their turn.
