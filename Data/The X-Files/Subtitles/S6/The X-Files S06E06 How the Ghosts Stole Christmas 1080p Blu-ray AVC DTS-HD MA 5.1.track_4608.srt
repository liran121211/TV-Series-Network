as another winter storm passes south of us.</i>

Hey, baby, you're home early!

8
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,826
Sheila, we got a really big problem here.

9
00:01:14,952 --> 00:01:16,954
What in the hell were you thinkin'?

10
00:01:17,037 --> 00:01:18,997
Happy Valentine's Day.

11
00:01:19,539 --> 00:01:21,833
We made a deal.

12
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:25,337
We agreed to keep
the engagement secret until I said so.

13
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:28,966
I know, but I just wanted
everybody in town to know

14
00:01:29,049 --> 00:01:31,385
why I've been so happy
the last few months.

15
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:33,178
<i>...yet another bone-dry day.</i>

16
00:01:33,303 --> 00:01:37,557
<i>The current temperature in Kroner is
45 degrees, with lows tonight around 40.</i>

17
00:01:37,683 --> 00:01:41,853
I know business is slow, but we can't stop
living just cos it hasn't rained in a spell.

18
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:44,898
Maybe we should just
call off the engagement.

19
00:01:45,023 --> 00:01:47,067
Don't do this, not today.

20
00:01:47,192 --> 00:01:49,111
It'll rain soon. I can feel it!

21
00:01:49,194 --> 00:01:51,405
I just need time to think.

22
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:56,493

wonder why your ass is so big.

Don't look at me. This was your idea.

48
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:28,330
Agent Mulder, welcome to Kroner.
I'm Jim Gilmore, the mayor.

49
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:31,791
We spoke on the phone. If I'd known
you were bringin' the missis,

50
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:36,087
- I'd have arranged fancier accommodation.
- I'm Agent Scully, Mulder's partner.

51
00:05:36,213 --> 00:05:39,508
I'm sure the accommodation will be just fine.

52
00:05:39,591 --> 00:05:41,259
Apologies, ma'am.

53
00:05:42,302 --> 00:05:45,680
We appreciate you flying out here
to help solve our crisis.

54
00:05:45,764 --> 00:05:49,059
I'd hoped for a bigger welcome, but, well...

55
00:05:49,142 --> 00:05:51,353
OK, Rhonda, that's enough.

56
00:05:51,436 --> 00:05:53,063

<i>(switches music off)</i>

58
00:05:54,648 --> 00:05:57,192
Uh, sir, you mentioned a crisis.

59
00:05:57,275 --> 00:06:01,613
Agent Mulder has been a little vague
as to the specifics of this crisis.

60
00:06:02,113 --> 00:06:03,615
Well, it's all around us.

61
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:08,954
Runted crops, field fires, bankruptcies.
The drought is destroyin' people's lives.

62
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:12,290
It's wrong for a single man
to prosper at the expense of others.

63
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:14,751
A single man?

64
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:16,169
Daryl Mootz.

65
00:06:16,294 --> 00:06:19,089
He's a local fella, chargin' people for rain.

66
00:06:21,132 --> 00:06:23,802
- You mean cloud seeding?
- The hell I do.

67
00:06:23,927 --> 00:06:28,098
He shows up at a farm, does his
dog-and- pony act, and the heavens weep.

68
00:06:30,308 --> 00:06:35,146
Well, sir, if this man Mootz could,
in fact, somehow produce rain,

69
00:06:35,272 --> 00:06:37,941
then what's the crime?

70
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:42,487
I believe Daryl's causin' the drought
so he can charge folks for the rain.

71
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:49,411
This is what you told Agent Mulder
when you spoke earlier?

72
00:06:49,494 --> 00:06:52,831
Yes, ma'am.
He seemed real eager to help us.

73
00:07:13,727 --> 00:07:17,439
Come on, Scully. You act
like I intentionally misled you.

74
00:07:17,522 --> 00:07:20,483
Over the past 30 years,
this town's had more tornadoes,

75
00:07:20,567 --> 00:07:24,446
heat waves and hailstorms than
any other town in the country. It's like...

76
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:27,324
ground zero for extreme weather.

77
00:07:27,407 --> 00:07:30,201
A man controlling the weather.

78
00:07:30,327 --> 00:07:35,790
If that's true, if Daryl Mootz
is controlling the weather for profit,

79
00:07:35,874 --> 00:07:38,710
then that is a crime
that should be investigated.

80
00:07:38,835 --> 00:07:41,421
I see the vacant buildings. I see the signs.

81
00:07:41,546 --> 00:07:46,760
These people are scared. But there have
always been droughts and natural disasters,

82
00:07:46,885 --> 00:07:49,054
and people always look for a scapegoat.

83
00:07:49,179 --> 00:07:52,557
Yeah, but how many scapegoats
lease office space?

88
00:08:17,082 --> 00:08:19,876
a carton of Morley Lights,
and a big bowl of jellybeans.

89
00:08:19,959 --> 00:08:24,422
And can you pick out all the green ones?
Cos he don't like the green ones.

90
00:08:24,547 --> 00:08:26,216
You're welcome.

91
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,594
Now, what can I do for the FBI?

92
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:31,096
We want to see the king.

93
00:08:31,221 --> 00:08:34,641
I'm sorry, he's out of state
till this afternoon on business.

94
00:08:34,766 --> 00:08:37,852
When you say on business,
you mean he's making it rain?

95
00:08:37,936 --> 00:08:40,689
Uh-huh. He's just across
the state line. Nebraska.

96
00:08:40,772 --> 00:08:44,192
- Town of Wymore.
- If we could get a list of all the people

97
00:08:44,275 --> 00:08:47,654
who have employed his services,
it would be helpful.

98
00:08:47,779 --> 00:08:50,115
I don't understand. Has he...?

99
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,535
Don't y'all need a warrant or
a subpoena or something like that?

100
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:56,246
We usually just say "please".

101
00:08:57,288 --> 00:09:01,418
What are you investigating Daryl for?
He's a hero in this community.

102
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:03,878
You actually believe that he makes it rain?

103
00:09:03,962 --> 00:09:08,717
I know it to be fact.
He saved my daddy's farm.

104
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,219
How dare you people!

105
00:09:11,302 --> 00:09:14,472
<i>The only rain in the area
is localised up around Wymore.</i>

106
00:09:15,181 --> 00:09:18,351
See? Daryl's making that rain.

107
00:09:18,476 --> 00:09:21,271
Is it possible he could have
followed it up there?

108
00:09:25,775 --> 00:09:30,947
Here's your damn client list.
You'll see: every one a satisfied customer.

109
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,283
This TV station. Is that far from here?

110
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:46,796
Oh! We were beginning to worry
that you wouldn't make it.

111
00:09:48,798 --> 00:09:52,177
This your first time in a TV studio?
How exciting.

112
00:09:52,302 --> 00:09:55,096
I couldn't be happier for the two of you.

113
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,056
I'm not sure...

114
00:09:59,392 --> 00:10:01,728
They're here. The Gundersons are here.

115
00:10:04,189 --> 00:10:07,442
Holman, I'd like to introduce you
to the Gundersons.

116
00:10:07,525 --> 00:10:11,821
Congratulations. I hope you have
a truly romantic getaway.

117
00:10:11,905 --> 00:10:14,616
Aren't you glad you watch
Channel <i>5</i> Weather?

118
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:18,453
We're Agents Mulder and Scully.
We're with the FBI.

119
00:10:18,536 --> 00:10:21,206
FBI? Oh, my goodness. I thought you were

120
00:10:21,331 --> 00:10:24,209
the "Watch the Weather and Win"
contest winners.

121
00:10:24,334 --> 00:10:29,506
See, we haven't had any rain in months,
and people tend to blame the messenger.

122
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:33,051
Oh, there's the Gundersons. Over here!

123
00:10:39,891 --> 00:10:41,893
It's like looking in a mirror.

124
00:10:42,769 --> 00:10:47,857
When I saw the pair of you, I thought you
were smartly dressed for a farm couple.

125
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:50,610
Make yourselves at home.

126
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:59,410
From what I've read, Kroner's had more
than its fair share of unusual weather.

127
00:10:59,536 --> 00:11:01,746
We certainly have.

128
00:11:01,871 --> 00:11:04,082
To you, Kroner must seem
small and simple,

129
00:11:04,207 --> 00:11:07,836
but through the eyes of meteorology -

130
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:11,130
low-pressure systems,
storm fronts, tornado watches -

131
00:11:11,256 --> 00:11:14,676
Kroner is sophisticated, complex,

132
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:17,554
and, well...

133
00:11:17,637 --> 00:11:19,556
sexy.

134
00:11:20,932 --> 00:11:24,769
Frankly, I can't imagine a more
exciting place to be a meteorologist.

135
00:11:24,894 --> 00:11:27,897
Mr Hardt, what can you tell us
about Daryl Mootz?

136
00:11:28,273 --> 00:11:32,986
Oh, the mayor called you in, didn't he?
He thinks Daryl's causing the drought.

137
00:11:33,111 --> 00:11:35,864
- You don't think he's responsible.
- Of course not.

138
00:11:35,947 --> 00:11:38,783
A huge high-pressure system
is the primary culprit.

139
00:11:38,908 --> 00:11:39,993
There's no evidence

140
00:11:40,118 --> 00:11:45,123
to suggest that Daryl, or any man,
can be held accountable for our predicament.

141
00:11:45,248 --> 00:11:49,502
- Thank you. Can we go now?
- No. Uh, what about the rain?

142
00:11:49,627 --> 00:11:54,132
That's a more... clouded issue,
if you'll excuse my pun.

143
00:11:54,257 --> 00:11:58,803
I have a list of over 40 names here.

144
00:11:58,928 --> 00:12:03,766
People in four different counties who claim
that Daryl Mootz has made it rain for them.

145
00:12:04,726 --> 00:12:09,397
I went to high school with Daryl.
Different social circles, and...

146
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,319
Frankly, he's about the last man
I would give credit to for anything...

147
00:12:14,402 --> 00:12:15,862
I hear a big "but" coming.

148
00:12:17,822 --> 00:12:19,991
Daryl appears to be the real deal.

149
00:12:21,534 --> 00:12:24,495
I can't explain it, but...

150
00:12:24,579 --> 00:12:28,249
where he wanders, showers follow.

151
00:12:41,554 --> 00:12:45,642
Look at the desperation on their faces.
They're ready to believe anything.

152
00:12:45,725 --> 00:12:49,687
According to his schedule,
the king should have been here by now.

153
00:12:49,771 --> 00:12:51,898
(man) Here he comes!

154
00:13:22,095 --> 00:13:24,305
(Daryl) Oh, isn't that sweet?

155
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:28,810
Man, what could we use around here,
a little rain? (laughs)

156
00:13:28,893 --> 00:13:32,188
Oh, look at this. Ah.

157
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:34,774
Take these, will you, somebody?

158
00:13:35,817 --> 00:13:38,486
Ahh. Ah.

159
00:13:46,285 --> 00:13:49,288
That is the wrong damn boot now,
isn't it, hon?

160
00:13:49,372 --> 00:13:52,709
Be a good girl and go on
and get me the red snakeskin.

161
00:13:53,626 --> 00:13:55,670
Well, lookie here.

162
00:13:56,129 --> 00:13:58,131
The FBI.

163
00:13:58,214 --> 00:14:00,717
We just came to see the show.

164
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,177
I guess we're a little early.

165
00:14:03,261 --> 00:14:05,805
O ye of little faith.

166
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:10,935
That truck out there of mine
is a whole lot faster than my rain clouds.

167
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:12,687
Excuse me.

168
00:14:14,897 --> 00:14:16,482
Thank you.

169
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:20,611
- How do you explain your unique ability?
- I don't.

170
00:14:20,695 --> 00:14:22,530
It's complicated.

171
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:25,074
Try me. I watch The Weather Channel.

172
00:14:27,660 --> 00:14:31,914
If you're wondering, did I ask for this gift,

173
00:14:31,998 --> 00:14:33,791
no, sir, I did not.

174
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:37,295
No more than I asked to lose this here limb.

175
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:42,592
But I should have expected it.
And I'll tell you why.

176
00:14:42,675 --> 00:14:46,929
Because I come from
a long line of healin' people.

177
00:14:47,013 --> 00:14:49,223
I'm a spiritual man in touch

178
00:14:50,641 --> 00:14:52,602
with the really real.

179
00:14:52,685 --> 00:14:55,938
The... the unseen real.

180
00:14:58,316 --> 00:15:00,610
<i>(instrumental rock)</i>

181
00:15:03,613 --> 00:15:07,700
And I... am 1/64th Cherokee.

182
00:15:08,618 --> 00:15:11,454
And I can summon up my ancestors

183
00:15:11,537 --> 00:15:15,208
to bring water to this thirsty land.

184
00:15:18,294 --> 00:15:19,754
Yeah!

185
00:15:31,432 --> 00:15:35,728
- Mulder, what are we doing here?
- This is not without historical precedent.

186
00:15:35,812 --> 00:15:38,898
The Old West was full of men
who claimed to be rainmakers.

187
00:15:38,981 --> 00:15:43,277
- The Pueblo Indians even had a rain dance.
- Mulder, that is not a rain dance.

188
00:15:43,361 --> 00:15:47,281
My Irish Aunt Olive has more
Cherokee in her than Daryl Mootz.

189
00:15:49,117 --> 00:15:51,869
Does that look like a man
who can control the weather?

190
00:15:51,953 --> 00:15:53,704
<i>(thunderclap)</i>

191
00:15:53,788 --> 00:15:55,832
<i>(excited yelling)</i>

192
00:16:01,212 --> 00:16:02,296
Yeah!

193
00:16:20,106 --> 00:16:22,984
Are we still going to the reunion
together on Friday?

194
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:25,653
Absolutely. Social event of the decade.

195
00:16:26,737 --> 00:16:30,408
Hard to believe it's been 20 years
since we finished high school.

196
00:16:30,491 --> 00:16:32,827
Where did the time go?

197
00:16:33,870 --> 00:16:36,581
What were those FBI people looking for?

198
00:16:36,664 --> 00:16:41,252
They were asking questions about Daryl.
About making it rain.

199
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:45,756
I wish they'd just go back to wherever
they came from and leave him alone.

200
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:48,885
You don't still love him, do you?

201
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:55,516
I can't believe you still care about him
after the way he treated you.

202
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,353
- I know.
- He never loved you, Sheila.

203
00:17:00,521 --> 00:17:04,942
All he cared about was your money,
and as soon as he got some of his own...

204
00:17:05,026 --> 00:17:08,654
He left. I know.
But I think he used to love me.

205
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:14,452
There are other men who'll love you more.

206
00:17:14,869 --> 00:17:16,829
FBI, my Lord.

207
00:17:16,913 --> 00:17:21,083
I don't think I'll be able to sleep,
knowin' they're pokin' around.

208

<i>(chain saw)</i>

214
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:50,214
Oh, Miss, we moved your
boyfriend's things into your room.

215
00:18:50,298 --> 00:18:53,676
He's my partner,
and we prefer separate rooms.

216
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:55,594
Old-fashioned, are you, huh?

217
00:18:55,678 --> 00:19:00,391
We're booked solid with
the high-school reunion. Take it or leave it.

218
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:04,478
We can just butterfly it.
I've got my kit over in the car.

219
00:19:04,562 --> 00:19:07,606
I don't think it's a coincidence
that a cow gets hurled at me

220
00:19:07,690 --> 00:19:10,735
just as we're down here
investigating the weather.

221
00:19:10,818 --> 00:19:14,572
- Did they check you for head trauma?
- That cow had my name on it.

222
00:19:20,619 --> 00:19:22,496
Agent Mulder, are you all right?

223
00:19:22,580 --> 00:19:26,959
I feel terrible. If there's anything
I can do, please don't hesitate.

224
00:19:27,043 --> 00:19:30,796
Perhaps there is. Would you
please reassure Agent Mulder

225
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,175
that this cow incident was,
in fact, a natural phenomenon?

226
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:36,177
With pleasure.

227
00:19:36,260 --> 00:19:39,722
I believe that a mini-twister
picked that poor creature up,

228
00:19:39,805 --> 00:19:44,101
lifted it about 12,000 feet,
where the air cooled, and, uh...

229
00:19:45,478 --> 00:19:47,021
I'm just grateful
you weren't hurt any worse.

230
00:19:48,147 --> 00:19:50,399
<i>(Sheila) Excuse me.</i>

231
00:19:53,194 --> 00:19:56,989
- You shouldn't be here.
- Holman, don't make this any harder.

232
00:19:58,574 --> 00:20:01,452
It's my fault. I did it.

233
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:08,084
I'm so sorry. I didn't mean for this to happen.

234
00:20:09,126 --> 00:20:15,257
- It's not something that I can control.
- Are you saying you're responsible for...

235
00:20:15,341 --> 00:20:17,927
I murdered that poor cow!

236
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:25,351
Holman just explained to us that
a mini-twister is what caused the accident.

237
00:20:25,434 --> 00:20:29,063
He's just being sweet, covering for me.
He knows the truth.

238
00:20:31,190 --> 00:20:34,944
This isn't the first time
something like this happened.

239
00:20:35,945 --> 00:20:40,324
The night of my senior prom,
a tornado demolished our high school.

240
00:20:40,408 --> 00:20:41,826
<i>(screaming)</i>

241
00:20:42,701 --> 00:20:48,499
And then, on my wedding day,
a day I'd always dreamed about,

242
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:54,004
<i>the ceremony was outdoors
on the 4th of July weekend.</i>

243
00:20:54,088 --> 00:20:56,382
<i>It snowed six inches.</i>

244
00:20:57,633 --> 00:21:03,097
<i>Three years later, my husband ran off
with some gal from the phone company,</i>

245
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:06,183
<i>and on the day
that our divorce was finalised,</i>

246
00:21:06,267 --> 00:21:08,978
<i>I stepped out of the courthouse, and...</i>

247
00:21:09,061 --> 00:21:14,442
You know how you... you can see
shapes in those big fluffy clouds?

248
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:17,445
Well...

249
00:21:17,528 --> 00:21:22,533
I swear that every cloud in that
big, blue sky was a face laughing at me.

250
00:21:25,661 --> 00:21:28,038
That was about 10 years ago,

251
00:21:28,122 --> 00:21:31,041
and that was the last time it happened

252
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:32,543
until last night.

253
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:41,218
- What's your connection to Daryl Mootz?
- Well, we used to be engaged.

254
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:44,597
You two were engaged?

255
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:46,557
Yeah, about six months ago,

256
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:50,394
and, uh, we had a fight and he took a drive,

257
00:21:50,478 --> 00:21:54,356
and... and a freak hailstorm cost him his leg.

258
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:59,820
And ever since then,
the rain's been following him.

259
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:08,078
- Am I under arrest?
- No.

260
00:22:08,162 --> 00:22:11,832
Without a doubt, you're not
responsible for any of that weather.

261
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,542
Oh. But...

262
00:22:13,626 --> 00:22:16,462
Agent Scully and I specialise
in these types of cases.

263
00:22:16,545 --> 00:22:22,218
And although you may have had
some bad luck, you didn't cause any of it.

264
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:24,428
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah. I'm sure.

265
00:22:24,512 --> 00:22:28,390
- Scully, do you have any doubts?
- No. No doubts.

266
00:22:28,474 --> 00:22:30,142
It's fine.

267
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:34,897
I really wanna believe you.

268
00:22:37,942 --> 00:22:40,361
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

269
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:50,538
- That hailstorm didn't cause Daryl's crash.
- What are you talking about?

270
00:22:50,621 --> 00:22:53,749
The weather was bad, but he
was drunk and drivin' too fast.

271
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:56,502
Drunk? I never heard that.

272
00:22:56,585 --> 00:22:59,797
We all felt that Daryl losing his leg
was punishment enough.

273
00:23:11,642 --> 00:23:14,270
People don't realise how hard a work this is.

274
00:23:14,353 --> 00:23:18,399
I mean, sure, it looks like
I'm just sittin' here, but...

275
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:20,985
my powers of concentration are...

276
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:23,195
Oh, yeah. Oh, right there. Yeah.

277
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:26,156
Yeah, you're worth every penny.

278
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:30,494
- What was I sayin'?
- Powers of concentration?

279
00:23:30,578 --> 00:23:31,662
- Right.
- Right.

280
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:35,249
My brain's functionin' on
something like 14 different levels,

281
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:41,046
taking in a whole bunch of variables,
like wind velocity and humidity and...

282
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:42,590
Daryl.

283
00:23:42,673 --> 00:23:44,800
- Do you hear that?
- Hear what?

284
00:23:44,883 --> 00:23:47,177
The rain stopped.

285
00:23:57,396 --> 00:23:58,856
Uh-oh.

286
00:24:05,738 --> 00:24:07,740
<i>(door opens)</i>

287
00:24:08,365 --> 00:24:10,993
- Next flight out is 10am.
- Look at this, Scully.

288
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:14,872
September 20th, 1991.

289
00:24:14,955 --> 00:24:17,583
It rained rose petals for nearly an hour.

290
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:21,587
We're going home.
The rain stopped this afternoon.

291
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:25,299
Daryl Mootz is being sued
by about 50 people. There's no case.

292
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:28,719
You told Sheila that she
wasn't controlling the weather.

293
00:24:28,802 --> 00:24:31,722
She's not. Neither is Daryl.

294
00:24:31,805 --> 00:24:33,724
But check this out:

295
00:24:33,807 --> 00:24:37,645
On the same day that it rained rose petals...

296
00:24:37,728 --> 00:24:43,651
"lrene Hardt, beloved wife and devoted
mother, passed away yesterday afternoon."

297
00:24:44,735 --> 00:24:47,780
"She's survived by one son,
Holman Hardt."

298
00:24:47,863 --> 00:24:51,033
- You're saying Holman...
- Is manufacturing the weather.

299
00:24:51,116 --> 00:24:53,994
Did you see his relief when
he learned Daryl was drunk?

300
00:24:54,078 --> 00:24:56,455
I've been doing some checking.

301
00:24:56,538 --> 00:25:01,293
Holman Hardt has been hospitalised
five times with nervous exhaustion,

302
00:25:01,377 --> 00:25:05,047
each time coinciding with
a major meteorological event.

303
00:25:05,130 --> 00:25:09,009
It is still a huge leap to say that
he's manufacturing the weather.

304
00:25:09,093 --> 00:25:13,347
Most people admit the weather plays
a significant role in the way they feel.

305
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:17,726
- There's even that disorder.
- SAD: seasonal affective disorder.

306
00:25:17,810 --> 00:25:22,189
Who's to say it doesn't work both ways? That
the way someone feels can affect the weather.

307
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:26,360
That the weather is somehow
an expression of Holman Hardt's feelings.

308
00:25:26,443 --> 00:25:30,989
Or better still, the feelings
that he's not expressing.

309
00:25:31,782 --> 00:25:34,618
I've tried to say this a thousand times,

310
00:25:35,661 --> 00:25:38,789
tried to express the...

311
00:25:38,872 --> 00:25:44,086
fire that burns inside this humble exterior.

312
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:50,300
Sheila, you're the reason I remained
in this town all these years.

<i>I'm looking forward

320
00:26:16,285 --> 00:26:18,996

- You sound in a good mood.

321
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:23,542
<i>I am, Holman, and it's all because of you.</i>

322
00:26:23,625 --> 00:26:28,672
I want you to know that I've been thinking
about what you said about Daryl yesterday,

323
00:26:29,423 --> 00:26:32,301
<i>- and I realised that you were right.</i>
- I <i>was?</i>

324
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:36,805
Yes, you were, and I am so over him.
Daryl who? That's what I say.

325
00:26:37,556 --> 00:26:41,185
<i>I realised that I've been chasing
the wrong kind of guy.</i>

326
00:26:41,268 --> 00:26:45,856
<i>I need someone who I can talk to.
I need someone who I can feel safe with.</i>

327
00:26:45,939 --> 00:26:48,692
I can't tell you what that means to me.

328
00:26:49,151 --> 00:26:51,236
Holman, I want to ask you something,

329
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:54,865
and I hope that we can keep it
our secret for the time being.

330
00:26:54,948 --> 00:26:56,784
Of course, Sheila. Anything.

331
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:00,788
Well, what do you think of Agent Mulder?

334
00:27:16,345 --> 00:27:17,805
Hey, Holman.

335
00:27:23,435 --> 00:27:26,021
- Agent Mulder.
- I've come to say goodbye.

336
00:27:26,104 --> 00:27:28,941
- You're leaving?
- Yeah.

337
00:27:29,024 --> 00:27:32,069
But I want you to get some help
before you kill somebody.

338
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:34,530
- What do you mean?
- You know what I mean.

339
00:27:34,613 --> 00:27:37,407
You're not just a weatherman.
You're the weatherman.

340
00:27:37,491 --> 00:27:40,202
You're the person who's
affecting the weather.

341
00:27:40,285 --> 00:27:45,707
If I could control the weather, don't you
think I'd make it rain, and end this drought?

342
00:27:45,791 --> 00:27:47,918
I don't think you do it on purpose.

343
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:51,839
I think you bottle up your emotions -
anger, grief, love or whatever -

344
00:27:51,922 --> 00:27:55,634
and then as a response it rains
or hails or there's a flying cow.

345
00:27:56,677 --> 00:28:00,305
- That poor animal.
- Well, whatever it is, you gotta let it out.

346
00:28:02,516 --> 00:28:04,184
I can't.

347
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:09,189
Yeah, you can.

348
00:28:13,068 --> 00:28:15,696
It's Sheila, isn't it? You love her.

349
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:21,034
You've always loved her.

350
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:25,372
That, uh, tornado at the high school.

351
00:28:26,415 --> 00:28:28,709
That was you, wasn't it?

352
00:28:33,422 --> 00:28:36,300
The night of our senior prom, I, uh...

353
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:41,513
accidentally stumbled upon
her and her boyfriend...

354
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:47,352
in flagrante delicto.

355
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,480
And the next thing you know...

356
00:28:53,233 --> 00:28:56,987
And you've never told her the way you feel?

357
00:28:57,070 --> 00:29:00,824
How could a frog tell a swan
that he loves her?

358
00:29:02,117 --> 00:29:06,246
Well, you'd better tell her,
or you're gonna kill somebody.

359
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:08,916
- You gotta help me.
- I got a plane to catch.

360
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:11,543
You can't go.
If you don't help me, who will?

361
00:29:11,627 --> 00:29:15,172
- I <i>am meeting my partner at the airport.</i>
<i>- (cell phone rings)</i>

362
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:19,760
<i>- Mulder.
- (Scully) Mulder, it's me.</i>

363
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:21,970
- <i>I'm on my</i> way.
<i>- I'm not so sure.</i>

364
00:29:22,054 --> 00:29:25,390
Have you looked outside lately?
It's pea soup.

365

<i>- Our plane can't take off until this fog lifts.
- Fog'?</i>

366
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:32,189
Holman!

367
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:37,361
- Holman?
- Yeah, he wants advice. Dating advice.

368
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:41,239
- Dating advice? From whom?
- Yours truly.

369
00:29:44,618 --> 00:29:46,328
Hello? Hey, Scully?

370
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:49,498
- <i>Scully, are you there?</i>
- I heard you.

371
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:53,460
Mulder, when was the last time
you went on a date?

372
00:29:53,543 --> 00:29:56,213
I will talk to you later.

373
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:02,386

375
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:21,113
Daryl, you're like one of
those tragic rock stars.

376
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:25,033
You know, like Jim Morrison or Kurt Cobain.

377
00:30:25,117 --> 00:30:28,704
You just shine too bright for too short a time.

378
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,708
We'll tell our kids all about it.

379
00:30:32,791 --> 00:30:35,502
Kids? I can't afford kids.

380
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:39,798
If I don't come up with a lot of cash pronto,
I am in deep doo-doo.

00:30:46,346 --> 00:30:50,434
- There's got to be somebody...
- We'll get the money, baby.

384
00:30:53,854 --> 00:30:57,065
- Sheila.
- What about her?

00:30:59,943 --> 00:31:01,486
Cindy...

386
00:31:02,821 --> 00:31:08,285

but I think we can use some time apart.

00:31:09,119 --> 00:31:14,082
- What? Are you breakin' up with me?
- Nothin' personal.

<i>(Holman)</i> I've been envious of men

I'd assumed you were more experienced.

This is about you, Holman.
I'm here to help you.

395
00:31:54,498 --> 00:31:57,793
I'm perfectly happy with
my friendship with Agent Scully.

396
00:32:04,299 --> 00:32:10,097
So, your theory is I walk in there, tell her
I love her, and the drought will end?

397
00:32:11,807 --> 00:32:14,184
Just tell her how you feel.

398
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:19,523

See you tonight, Holman.

416
00:33:33,221 --> 00:33:34,723

417
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:39,394
No, you did it.

418

- Well, what's he got that I ain't got?
- A job.

427
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:18,767
A way with words. Intelligence, good looks.

428

- No.

433
00:34:49,589 --> 00:34:55,553
Mulder, the fog has lifted,
and if you're ready, the plane is waiting.

434
00:34:55,637 --> 00:34:58,890
Scully, do you know
anything about weather radar?

435
00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:03,144
- A bit. Why?
- What does red mean?

436
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:07,899
Thunderstorms, I think.

00:35:09,025 --> 00:35:11,695

I feel that given the circumstances,

488

you should hear his theory,
because it involves you and Holman.

this bizarre set of weather conditions
that have plagued you over the years,

491

Specifically, that... that his emotions

493

are somehow manifesting
themselves in the weather.

believes that Holman is...

- What?

00:39:20,568 --> 00:39:23,696
You're jealous that Mulder
and I have a special connection,

499
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:27,283
- and you're trying to divert me to Holman.
- What?

500
00:39:30,411 --> 00:39:33,414
It is good to be the king!

501
00:39:33,498 --> 00:39:35,083
<i>(laughs)</i>

502
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:38,753
It is good to be the king!

503
00:39:41,172 --> 00:39:43,049
Where's Sheila?

504
00:39:43,591 --> 00:39:47,053
- Where's your leg?
- Cindy took it.

505
00:39:47,136 --> 00:39:49,264
Said I'd have to crawl back to her.

506
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,100
Now, where's Sheila?

507
00:39:52,183 --> 00:39:54,310
Not even a kiss?

508
00:39:56,896 --> 00:39:59,774
Trust me, the man knows how to kiss.

509
00:40:02,902 --> 00:40:05,905
I've just never thought of Holman
that way, you know?

510
00:40:05,989 --> 00:40:08,116
He's my closest friend.

511
00:40:08,199 --> 00:40:10,827
And to not even suspect.

512
00:40:11,578 --> 00:40:13,705
Well, it seems to me

513
00:40:13,788 --> 00:40:17,083
that the best relationships, the ones that last,

514
00:40:17,166 --> 00:40:20,587
are frequently the ones
that are rooted in friendship.

515
00:40:20,670 --> 00:40:23,423
You know, one day you look at the person,

516
00:40:23,506 --> 00:40:27,635
and you see something more
than you did the night before.

517
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:31,306
Like a switch has been flicked somewhere.

518
00:40:31,389 --> 00:40:34,934
And the person who was just a friend is

519
00:40:35,018 --> 00:40:39,022
suddenly the only person
you can ever imagine yourself with.

520
00:40:45,695 --> 00:40:49,282
The storm drains are filling up.
Let's get outta here.

521
00:40:55,204 --> 00:40:57,665
I'll teach you to mess with my woman!

522
00:41:05,256 --> 00:41:09,510
- (woman) God, Daryl!
- If I had two legs, I'd kick your...

523
00:41:21,022 --> 00:41:22,273
I called the police.

524
00:41:22,357 --> 00:41:26,361
You might want to look at the king,
make sure he's all right.

525
00:41:26,986 --> 00:41:29,364
Whatever happened to Sheila?

526
00:41:47,507 --> 00:41:51,052
Is it true? That you make the weather?

527
00:41:53,971 --> 00:41:55,515
Cos of me?

528
00:41:57,850 --> 00:41:59,811
The tornado in high school?

529
00:41:59,894 --> 00:42:02,438
- Snow at my wedding?
- I'm so sorry.

530
00:42:02,939 --> 00:42:05,942
- Daryl's rain?
- I can't explain the logic of it.

531
00:42:06,025 --> 00:42:09,904
Yes. Some strange manifestation of guilt.

532
00:42:10,446 --> 00:42:14,242
Even <i>this</i> rain? Because you love me?

533
00:42:15,702 --> 00:42:18,705
Because I love you.

534
00:42:24,043 --> 00:42:27,672
That is the most romantic thing
I've ever heard.

535
00:42:46,649 --> 00:42:48,526
<i>(cheering)</i>

536
00:42:52,071 --> 00:42:57,785

- Me too.

539
00:43:06,502 --> 00:43:08,504
I brought you a leg.

540
00:43:13,384 --> 00:43:15,803
Why are you so good to me, honey?

541
00:43:15,887 --> 00:43:19,849

542
00:43:19,932 --> 00:43:25,104

- Wet?

546
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,211
Well, how'd it go?

547
00:43:48,294 --> 00:43:51,923
You should try it sometime.

548
00:43:52,006 --> 00:43:53,758
Sheila?

549
00:43:53,841 --> 00:43:59,847
<i>That's where you'll find me</i>

550
00:44:00,014 --> 00:44:03,309

<i>(baby cries)</i>

553
00:44:16,906 --> 00:44:19,700
You're a chip off the old block. Yes, you are!

554
00:44:19,784 --> 00:44:21,035
Yes, you are!

555
00:44:21,118 --> 00:44:26,249
