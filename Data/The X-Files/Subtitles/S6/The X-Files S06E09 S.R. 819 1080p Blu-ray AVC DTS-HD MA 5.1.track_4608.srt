1
00:00:25,194 --> 00:00:27,779
(footsteps)

2
00:01:26,171 --> 00:01:27,965
(lift bell dings)

3
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:36,283
(gasping and grunting)

4
00:02:47,377 --> 00:02:49,588
(shouting)

5
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:54,593
(screaming)

6
00:03:04,061 --> 00:03:06,646
(screaming continues)

7
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:09,691
(Crash)

8
00:03:17,824 --> 00:03:19,701
(camera flash charging)

9
00:04:05,205 --> 00:04:07,499
Just a routine background check.

10
00:04:07,582 --> 00:04:12,629
Now, to the best of your knowledge, has
Mr Wisnowski ever used any illegal drugs?

11
00:04:12,712 --> 00:04:14,214
Which illegal drugs?

12
00:04:14,339 --> 00:04:18,260
Yeah. In the time that you
worked with Ms Ermentrout,

13
00:04:18,343 --> 00:04:22,180
did you find her to be a trustworthy person?

14
00:04:24,266 --> 00:04:27,436
Punctual, huh? Punctual... is good.

15
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:31,314
No. No, ma'am. This is just
a routine background check.

16
00:04:31,398 --> 00:04:35,777
Mr Garber is not in any
legal trouble whatsoever.

17
00:04:37,446 --> 00:04:40,490
Yeah. OK. Thanks for your time.

18
00:04:42,784 --> 00:04:46,580
Maybe if we get lucky, next time
they'll let us clean toilet bowls.

19
00:04:46,663 --> 00:04:48,540
- Are you ready to quit?
- No.

20
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:52,294
That would make way too many people
way too happy.

21
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:54,671
(phone rings)

22
00:04:54,754 --> 00:04:56,089
Scully.

23
00:04:58,091 --> 00:04:59,968
I'm on my way.

24
00:05:02,429 --> 00:05:06,183
(whispers) Called into Kersh's office. Just me.

25
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,477
JUSt you?

26
00:05:10,812 --> 00:05:12,814
Don't forget your toilet brush!

27
00:05:12,898 --> 00:05:15,567
No. No, ma'am, not you.

28
00:05:18,612 --> 00:05:19,863
(knock on door)

29
00:05:21,656 --> 00:05:23,658
- Agent.
- Sir.

30
00:05:25,327 --> 00:05:29,998
Dana Scully, this is Agent Peyton Ritter
with the Bureau's New York office.

31
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:31,625
- Agent Ritter.
- Hi.

32
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,253
Show her what you have.

33
00:05:35,337 --> 00:05:38,715
Our office is currently updating
its case filing system.

34
00:05:38,798 --> 00:05:40,842
While I was involved in this project,

35
00:05:40,926 --> 00:05:45,639
scanning old crime-scene photographs
into the computer, I came across this.

36
00:05:50,727 --> 00:05:52,771
Margareta Stoller. Age: 57.

37
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:55,315
Cause of death: an overdose of nitraz...

38
00:05:57,859 --> 00:06:00,195
Take a look at when they found her.

39
00:06:00,278 --> 00:06:03,114
A neighbour called the police at 11:14pm.

40
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,034
Right. So, what's wrong with that picture?

41
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:13,959
The clock says that it's 45 minutes earlier.
A clock can be wrong.

42
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:17,671
They certainly can. So I checked
the Post from the following clay.

43
00:06:17,754 --> 00:06:20,257
These are straight from their photo files.

44
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:25,178
Hmm. Almost an hour and a half later.

45
00:06:25,887 --> 00:06:28,557
Two different negatives,
same photographer.

46
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,559
The guy's name is Alfred Fellig.

47
00:06:30,642 --> 00:06:32,978
He's rattled around Manhattan for years,

48
00:06:33,061 --> 00:06:37,482
apparently a stringer for the wire services
and an on-call guy for NYPD.

49
00:06:37,566 --> 00:06:41,987
And you suspect this man Fellig?
You think that Mrs Stoller wasn't a suicide?

50
00:06:42,904 --> 00:06:45,490
This guy's into takin' pictures, right?

51
00:06:46,741 --> 00:06:50,370
So I'mthinkin':
what if he poisons this woman,

52
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:52,914
then snaps a few of her dead body,

53
00:06:52,998 --> 00:06:56,209
then winds up back
in the same apartment an hour later

54
00:06:56,334 --> 00:06:59,170
after Midtown North
calls him over to do the job?

55
00:07:00,297 --> 00:07:01,798
That's quite a theory.

56
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:05,635
Yeah. The thing is, he might have
done it on more than one occasion.

57
00:07:05,719 --> 00:07:08,930
I've sifted through probably
2,000 of his police photos.

58
00:07:09,014 --> 00:07:11,808
These three have measurable solar shadows.

59
00:07:11,891 --> 00:07:15,687
- Since we know each location...
- You know the time of day by the shadows.

60
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:20,191
Right. And with it, these three
are looking every bit as hinky.

61
00:07:20,317 --> 00:07:23,737
You have another suicide,
a heart attack, and an obvious murder

62
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:26,448
for which another man was convicted.

63
00:07:26,531 --> 00:07:28,366
There's no consistent MO.

64
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:30,452
There's no consistent anything.

65
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:35,415
I could sure use your help.

66
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:40,670
Agent, could you step outside, please?

67
00:07:40,754 --> 00:07:42,130
Sure.

68
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:53,600
I'd say he has
a promising career ahead of him.

69
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:57,354
So did you... at one time.

70
00:08:00,482 --> 00:08:05,362
With your expertise in forensic pathology,
you'd be an asset to this investigation.

71
00:08:05,445 --> 00:08:08,531
It would be more challenging
than running background checks.

72
00:08:08,615 --> 00:08:10,867
Agent Mulder and I will begin immediately.

73
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:14,621
Agent Mulder's a lost cause.
I'm taking the chance you're not.

74
00:08:14,704 --> 00:08:16,456
It's you and Ritter.

75
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:18,375
Do not let me down.

76
00:09:12,637 --> 00:09:14,389
(panting)

77
00:09:14,472 --> 00:09:16,766
(grunting/groaning)

78
00:09:18,768 --> 00:09:20,520
(cries out)

79
00:09:29,696 --> 00:09:31,698
(camera flash charging)

80
00:09:32,949 --> 00:09:35,702
(panting/gasping)

81
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,761
- Mulder?
- Hmm?

82
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:58,767
- What are you doing?
- Bein' nosy.

83
00:09:59,684 --> 00:10:02,270
Eatin' my heart out.
You're going on an X-File.

84
00:10:02,353 --> 00:10:04,981
- It's not an X-File.
- That's not what I read.

85
00:10:05,064 --> 00:10:08,651
Murder by telekinesis?
Maybe a shamanistic "death touch"?

86
00:10:08,735 --> 00:10:12,739
The Muslim superstition that to
photograph someone is to steal their soul?

87
00:10:12,822 --> 00:10:15,158
Thank you. All very helpful.

88
00:10:16,534 --> 00:10:18,369
So they're splitting us up, huh?

89
00:10:19,162 --> 00:10:21,998
No. This is a one-time thing.

90
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:25,960
Who told you that? If you do a good job,
they won't stick you back here.

91
00:10:28,546 --> 00:10:30,089
Right?

92
00:10:36,012 --> 00:10:38,139
Agent Scully, we're all set.

93
00:10:38,223 --> 00:10:40,475
Peyton Ritter, this is Fox Mulder.

94
00:10:40,558 --> 00:10:44,646
- It's a pleasure to meet you, Fox.
- Pleasure to meet you, Peyton.

95
00:10:45,772 --> 00:10:48,399
- We should get going.
- Off to New York.

96
00:10:59,202 --> 00:11:02,163
Alfred Fellig. What can you tell us about him?

97
00:11:03,581 --> 00:11:08,419
What's to tell? He's one of 10,000 people here
who have a licence to piss people off.

98
00:11:08,545 --> 00:11:11,714
He doubles as a crime-scene
photographer for your precinct.

99
00:11:11,798 --> 00:11:14,342
Yeah, he comes in, snaps the picture.

100
00:11:14,425 --> 00:11:15,969
Keeps to himself.

101
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:19,055
There's not much personal information there.

102
00:11:19,138 --> 00:11:22,267
There's not supposed to be.
It's just a yearly renewal form.

103
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:26,604
Would you happen to know when
the original background check was done?

104
00:11:28,106 --> 00:11:34,112
Here he is again. Yearly renewal dating back
to January 1970, but still no original.

105
00:11:34,195 --> 00:11:36,239
I think I've got it.

106
00:11:37,031 --> 00:11:39,284
1964.

107
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,661
(whistles) Old-timer.

108
00:11:41,786 --> 00:11:44,247
- Anything interesting?
- Maybe.

109
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:03,641
- What are you doing?
- Take a look at this.

110
00:12:06,728 --> 00:12:08,396
1996...

111
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,484
'87... '85... '73...

112
00:12:18,281 --> 00:12:19,532
(sighs)

113
00:12:20,325 --> 00:12:22,327
The guy's a regular Dick Clark.

114
00:12:23,328 --> 00:12:24,662
I don't know what to say.

115
00:12:24,746 --> 00:12:29,334
Other than the fact that he's always
been a geezer, this looks like a dead end.

116
00:12:34,881 --> 00:12:38,801
Help! Help! Somebody call the police!

117
00:12:38,885 --> 00:12:41,554
- What do you want? Are you crazy?
- (car honking)

118
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:44,974
Please help me! Lady, please! Help me!

119
00:12:49,437 --> 00:12:52,357
Man, what do you want from me, man?!
Oh, man, no!

120
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:54,525
(yelling)

121
00:13:02,575 --> 00:13:04,160
(camera clicks)

122
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:08,122
(camera clicking)

123
00:13:19,717 --> 00:13:22,553
(camera flash charging)

124
00:13:29,811 --> 00:13:31,479
(switchblade clicks open)

125
00:13:37,026 --> 00:13:39,028
(grunting)

126
00:14:01,426 --> 00:14:04,053
(gasping)

127
00:14:36,085 --> 00:14:37,920
(siren approaching)

128
00:14:38,004 --> 00:14:40,089
The prints are Alfred Fellig's.

129
00:14:40,965 --> 00:14:44,260
Positive match - right off
his 1964 background check.

130
00:14:44,343 --> 00:14:46,971
I slipped them into the SAFIS database.

131
00:14:47,055 --> 00:14:49,891
First thing this morning -
boom - up they came.

132
00:14:49,974 --> 00:14:52,351
You're thinking this is Fellig's work?

133
00:14:52,435 --> 00:14:55,146
The wound measurements
match with the knife.

134
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:58,649
- He got pretty sloppy in his old age.
- What's this?

135
00:14:58,775 --> 00:15:01,861
- A whole lot of blood.
- Yeah, I got that.

136
00:15:03,696 --> 00:15:07,658
- It's pretty clear he took a second victim.
- Where's the second body?

137
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:10,369
- They found Fellig.
- Where?

138
00:15:10,453 --> 00:15:13,456
Home, watchin' TV.
They're bringin' him in now.

139
00:15:16,417 --> 00:15:17,960
Check, check...

140
00:15:18,044 --> 00:15:20,713
January 4th, 11:36am.

141
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:23,591
15th Precinct, Manhattan.

142
00:15:23,674 --> 00:15:26,761
Agents present:
Dana Scully and Peyton Ritter.

143
00:15:26,844 --> 00:15:29,806
- Initial interview with...
- (door opens)

144
00:15:29,889 --> 00:15:31,891
...Alfred Fellig.

145
00:15:43,152 --> 00:15:44,695
Hello.

146
00:15:46,948 --> 00:15:49,200
You're a photographer.

147
00:15:50,409 --> 00:15:56,165
I've seen some of your work. You specialise
in some pretty dark subject matter.

148
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:02,046
You're around death a lot.
It must fascinate you.

149
00:16:03,631 --> 00:16:06,425
Am I boring you, Mr Fellig?

150
00:16:06,509 --> 00:16:08,094
Ask me a question already.

151
00:16:09,220 --> 00:16:10,972
All right.

152
00:16:11,055 --> 00:16:15,309
Why are you always Johnny-on-the-spot
every time somebody dies?

153
00:16:15,393 --> 00:16:18,437
You're always there to take the picture. How?

154
00:16:18,521 --> 00:16:22,275
I have a... a nose for news.

155
00:16:23,401 --> 00:16:28,406
Mr Fellig, your fingerprints were found
on a murder weapon at a crime scene.

156
00:16:28,489 --> 00:16:32,493
Could you give us a full accounting
of your activities last night?

157
00:16:32,577 --> 00:16:36,038
The Bronx. I was on a job.

158
00:16:36,122 --> 00:16:40,293
I saw some jibone stealin'
a kid's tennis shoes.

159
00:16:40,376 --> 00:16:43,045
He chased me. Ran off.

160
00:16:43,129 --> 00:16:45,214
He ran off?

161
00:16:45,756 --> 00:16:47,592
Some unidentified murderer?

162
00:16:47,758 --> 00:16:50,219
I guess I could identify him.

163
00:16:50,303 --> 00:16:53,431
Your fingerprints were found on the knife.

164
00:16:53,514 --> 00:16:56,267
- (grunts)
- How did they get there?

165
00:17:00,605 --> 00:17:05,610
He left the knife behind.
I guess I touched it... briefly.

166
00:17:05,693 --> 00:17:07,778
Why would you do that?

167
00:17:12,116 --> 00:17:14,327
Were you injured, Mr Fellig?

168
00:17:16,454 --> 00:17:19,373
You seem to be in pain.

169
00:17:19,457 --> 00:17:22,418
Were you attacked?

170
00:17:23,044 --> 00:17:25,755
We found other blood at the crime scene,

171
00:17:25,838 --> 00:17:27,882
and, when we have it tested,

172
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:31,886
I'm wondering if we're
gonna learn that it's yours.

173
00:17:31,969 --> 00:17:35,473
- I got cut some.
- May we see?

174
00:17:36,849 --> 00:17:38,976
(groaning)

175
00:17:43,856 --> 00:17:45,983
May I help you?

176
00:18:00,456 --> 00:18:01,958
Hey.

177
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:05,169
Hey. Take Mr Fellig to get his blood drawn.

178
00:18:05,962 --> 00:18:08,422
And photograph his back, too.

179
00:18:16,973 --> 00:18:21,894
Hey, I'm confused. I thought we were tryin' to
bust him, not look for reasons to let him go.

180
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:24,563
I thought we were looking for the truth.

181
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:33,864
(ringing tone)

182
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,701
- Scully.
- Hi. My name is Fox Mulder.

183
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:39,203
We used to sit next to each other at the FBI.

184
00:18:40,997 --> 00:18:42,623
How's your X-File 00min'?

185
00:18:42,707 --> 00:18:44,959
Mulder, it's not...

186
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:46,460
(sighs)

187
00:18:49,046 --> 00:18:51,173
We haven't made much headway.

188
00:18:51,257 --> 00:18:54,510
We arrested Alfred Fellig,
and we just released him.

189
00:18:54,593 --> 00:18:57,722
- What about the stabbing?
- How do you know about that?

190
00:18:57,888 --> 00:19:00,474
I told ya, I'm nosy.
Why are you lettin' him go?

191
00:19:00,558 --> 00:19:03,561
We pulled another set
of prints off of the knife.

192
00:19:03,644 --> 00:19:07,064
They belong to a convicted murderer
named Malcolm Wiggins.

193
00:19:08,482 --> 00:19:14,030
And the fact that Fellig's blood was found at
the crime scene tells me his story checks out.

194
00:19:14,113 --> 00:19:17,408
At least, that particular story, anyway.

195
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:20,036
But you still think Fellig's a murderer?

196
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:22,747
I don't know what to think.

197
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:27,626
He's, uh...

198
00:19:29,378 --> 00:19:30,629
unusual

199
00:19:30,713 --> 00:19:34,091
As in, he plugs up like
a cork when you stab him?

200
00:19:34,175 --> 00:19:35,968
Where are you getting this stuff?

201
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:39,347
Ritter's been sending
progress reports to Kersh.

202
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:42,266
My computer inadvertently intercepted a few.

203
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:46,979
He's got nice things to say
about you, though... mostly.

204
00:19:48,939 --> 00:19:52,109
Why don't you let me do
a background check on Fellig?

205
00:19:52,193 --> 00:19:55,696
- Mulder...
- It's what I do now. I'm gettin' good at it.

206
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:23,682
I'm parked around the block.

207
00:20:26,602 --> 00:20:30,481
Fellig's asleep. I haven't seen
him move in over four hours.

208
00:20:33,651 --> 00:20:35,736
Have a lovely evening.

209
00:21:08,519 --> 00:21:11,188
(camera clicking)

210
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:21,866
(pounding on door)
Mr Fellig, open up, please.

211
00:21:24,368 --> 00:21:26,203
Explain this.

212
00:21:26,871 --> 00:21:27,872
What?

213
00:21:27,955 --> 00:21:30,791
You took that photo
an hour before police arrived.

214
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:34,753
You then covered up that fact
by photographing the scene again.

215
00:21:34,837 --> 00:21:37,423
I don't think I remember that one.

216
00:21:37,506 --> 00:21:43,345
You have a long and uncanny history of
being the first person at the scene of a death.

217
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:47,224
You also have a history of
covering up that fact. Why?

218
00:21:47,308 --> 00:21:49,560
Am I under arrest... again?

219
00:21:49,643 --> 00:21:51,729
Are you a murderer?

220
00:21:53,314 --> 00:21:55,399
Then explain yourself, sir.

221
00:21:55,483 --> 00:21:59,278
Because I promise, until you do,
you will not get a moment's peace.

222
00:22:07,495 --> 00:22:10,247
You want to take a ride with me?

223
00:22:11,207 --> 00:22:14,001
You come with me. I'll show you.

224
00:22:22,426 --> 00:22:24,303
It's been an hour.

225
00:22:24,428 --> 00:22:29,016
- Are we gonna drive around all night?
- Yeah. This is it.

226
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:31,602
This is what I do.

227
00:22:31,685 --> 00:22:33,854
Lookin' for the shot.

228
00:22:34,605 --> 00:22:37,107
- What shot?
- The shot.

229
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:48,285
Her.

230
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:51,747
She's about to die.

231
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:55,960
What are you talking about?

232
00:22:56,043 --> 00:23:01,840
Could happen in the next minute, in the next
hour, but it'll happen, just as plain as day.

233
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:05,135
Look, Mr...

234
00:23:05,886 --> 00:23:08,722
Fellig, I don't know what you're planning,

235
00:23:08,806 --> 00:23:10,683
but nobody here's gonna die.

236
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:13,811
I'm not planning anything.

237
00:23:13,894 --> 00:23:17,481
I'm just here to tell you
what's gonna happen.

238
00:23:20,192 --> 00:23:22,653
That that woman there
is gonna be murdered?

239
00:23:22,736 --> 00:23:25,906
I didn't say "murdered".

240
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,409
She's a smoker. She might die of lung cancer.

241
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:31,579
The "how" is always a surprise.

242
00:23:32,621 --> 00:23:34,665
I just always know when.

243
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:37,376
You want me to believe that?

244
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:43,507
(man) What are you doin' out here, huh?

245
00:23:45,718 --> 00:23:48,470
It's so cold out, huh?

246
00:23:48,554 --> 00:23:52,182
(continues speaking indistinctly)

247
00:23:53,684 --> 00:23:57,521
- (man) All right?
- Get out of my face! Get off me!

248
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,817
(man and woman arguing)

249
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,444
(camera flash charging)

250
00:24:03,527 --> 00:24:06,196
I don't want your money!

251
00:24:07,406 --> 00:24:10,200
You creep! Get off of me! Let go of me!

252
00:24:10,326 --> 00:24:12,828
(arguing continues)

253
00:24:18,542 --> 00:24:20,586
FBI! Don't move!

254
00:24:20,669 --> 00:24:23,213
- Where'd you come from?
- Shut up!

255
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:26,342
Get down! Back up!

256
00:24:26,425 --> 00:24:29,053
(woman) You're not such a big man now!

257
00:24:37,728 --> 00:24:39,730
That gun ain't mine, Red.

258
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:44,234
- You all right?
- I'm outta here.

259
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,403
(honking)

260
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:14,807
Dana, what the hell is goin' on?

261
00:25:14,890 --> 00:25:18,644
Assault and possession of
an unregistered handgun.

262
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:21,438
- Why didn't you call me sooner?
- I apologise.

263
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:24,191
You blew off the surveillance?

264
00:25:28,278 --> 00:25:31,031
The surveillance was blown
before I got there.

265
00:25:31,115 --> 00:25:34,827
You blew off the surveillance
and took a little joyride with him?

266
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:39,832
I questioned Fellig about his involvement
in the deaths that he photographed.

267
00:25:39,915 --> 00:25:41,583
- Is that OK?
- What did he say?

268
00:25:41,667 --> 00:25:45,212
He said that he can tell
when people are about to die.

269
00:25:45,295 --> 00:25:48,424
If New York passes a Good Samaritan law,
we might nail him.

270
00:25:48,507 --> 00:25:51,051
Other than that, we won't get him for murder.

271
00:25:51,135 --> 00:25:53,303
Wrong. Let me show you something.

272
00:25:58,475 --> 00:26:03,021
They picked up Mr Wiggins last night.
He says Fellig killed that kid, not him.

273
00:26:03,105 --> 00:26:07,776
- He said he just happened along.
- A convicted murderer half Fellig's age.

274
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:11,363
He would've come in, but he was
afraid we wouldn't have believed him.

275
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:12,990
He's right.

276
00:26:13,073 --> 00:26:16,243
Tell me, did he have any help
concocting that story?

277
00:26:16,326 --> 00:26:19,163
Look. Fellig is a murderer.

278
00:26:19,246 --> 00:26:21,290
Whether he did this one, I don't care.

279
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:23,959
Not if it buys me a few days
in the box with him.

280
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:28,922
- No judge will issue a warrant based on this.
- I know the judge. We'll have it by noon.

281
00:26:32,259 --> 00:26:35,679
- You know, Kersh warned me about you.
- He did?

282
00:26:35,763 --> 00:26:40,100
You and your partner - his reputation
precedes him, so I should've seen it comin'.

283
00:26:40,184 --> 00:26:44,813
You muck up my case, and Kersh'll
hear about it. Are we clear, Dana?

284
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:46,565
- Scully.
- (cellphone rings)

285
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:49,526
And we're done with this conversation.

286
00:26:52,613 --> 00:26:54,698
- Yeah.
- (Mulder) Hey, Scully.

287
00:26:54,782 --> 00:26:58,202
How's that X-File? And before
you tell me it's not an X-File...

288
00:26:58,368 --> 00:27:01,205
- It is.
- What happened?

289
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:04,625
Alfred Fellig seems to know
an awful lot about death.

290
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:10,214
Yeah? Well, that's not surprising, given
that he's reached the ripe old age of 149.

291
00:27:10,714 --> 00:27:14,009
- Excuse me?
- I did a low-tech background check on him.

292
00:27:14,092 --> 00:27:17,012
This stuff is so old,
they don't keep it on computer.

293
00:27:17,095 --> 00:27:22,434
But Alfred Fellig doesn't exist before 1964,
but one Henry Strand does.

294
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:26,772
He applied for a press pass from
the Jersey City Police in 1939 at age 53.

295
00:27:26,855 --> 00:27:29,107
His prints match Fellig's.

296
00:27:29,191 --> 00:27:31,485
But there must be some kind of a mistake.

297
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:36,365
You think? Because this Henry Strand
does not exist before 1939.

298
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:40,410
However, one LH Rice is on record

299
00:27:40,536 --> 00:27:43,747
as having sat for the
New York State Civil Service Exam.

300
00:27:43,831 --> 00:27:46,333
The records don't show whether he passed.

301
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:49,169
But his thumbprint? Fellig's.

302
00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:53,924
Want to know what LH Rice's birthday is?

303
00:27:54,007 --> 00:27:56,844
April 4th, 1849.

304
00:27:56,927 --> 00:28:01,014
I'm not good at math, but that's
a whole lot of candles on the cake.

305
00:28:01,098 --> 00:28:05,978
I have spent time with this man,
and he can't be more than 65 years old.

306
00:28:06,061 --> 00:28:08,438
I think that's what he wants you to think.

307
00:28:08,981 --> 00:28:13,610
He's a guy for whom the phrase "life in
prison" carries some weighty connotations.

308
00:28:13,694 --> 00:28:17,281
You should get to him before he
vanishes and becomes someone else.

309
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:24,454
(car honks)

310
00:28:43,682 --> 00:28:45,684
(police radio scanner)

311
00:28:47,978 --> 00:28:51,690
You are going to be arrested,
Mr Fellig, in two hours.

312
00:28:52,983 --> 00:28:54,735
Charged with murder.

313
00:28:54,818 --> 00:28:58,322
And this time you won't be able
to just change your name.

314
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:02,618
I showed you what I do last night.
Just take the pictures.

315
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:09,041
What you showed me was a contemptible
lack of compassion for another human being.

316
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:12,127
You showed me that you
profit off of people's deaths.

317
00:29:12,961 --> 00:29:15,464
Now, why shouldn't you go to prison?

318
00:29:15,547 --> 00:29:18,008
You want me to cry for them?

319
00:29:18,091 --> 00:29:21,553
You want me to make
like I feel sorry for them?

320
00:29:21,678 --> 00:29:23,722
I don't.

321
00:29:24,723 --> 00:29:26,725
Lucky bastards.

322
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:31,063
- Every one of 'em.
- Lucky?

323
00:29:32,272 --> 00:29:34,358
I'm just there to get the shot.

324
00:29:34,441 --> 00:29:37,361
I don't take those people. He does.

325
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:39,529
Who's "he"?

326
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:14,147
That's him.

327
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:16,316
He's the one who takes them.

328
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:19,820
You're saying this is
a photograph of death itself?

329
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:22,614
It's a glimpse. Just a glimpse.

330
00:30:23,281 --> 00:30:25,909
But it's closer than I've gotten in...

331
00:30:25,993 --> 00:30:28,704
I can't even count the years.

332
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:31,790
And this is the shot that
you spoke of. This is...

333
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:35,836
- what you try and get.
- Mm-hm.

334
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:44,803
Mr Fellig, I know... that you know
more about photography than I do.

335
00:30:46,513 --> 00:30:49,683
But this is just a lens flare.

336
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:53,520
You're right. I do know more
about photography than you do.

337
00:30:58,859 --> 00:31:00,944
OK. I, um...

338
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:08,160
For the sake of argument, why bother?

339
00:31:08,243 --> 00:31:12,289
I mean, why take a picture of death?

340
00:31:12,372 --> 00:31:15,834
So I can look into his face.

341
00:31:15,959 --> 00:31:18,170
So I can die.

342
00:31:19,046 --> 00:31:21,131
Pills don't work.

343
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:25,844
Razors, gas, bridges...

344
00:31:25,969 --> 00:31:30,432
I can't tell ya how many bridges
I've jumped off of. All I get is wet.

345
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,188
I got left behind.

346
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:38,398
I don't want to be here any more.

347
00:31:38,482 --> 00:31:41,359
I can't even remember a time when I did.

348
00:31:43,487 --> 00:31:45,655
This is...

349
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:49,493
This is all I know... to do.

350
00:31:52,704 --> 00:31:54,414
You know I don't believe you.

351
00:31:54,498 --> 00:31:56,041
Yes, you do.

352
00:31:57,876 --> 00:32:00,378
It's why you're here.

353
00:32:22,025 --> 00:32:26,071
How is it you know when
people are about to die?

354
00:32:27,864 --> 00:32:29,407
Oh...

355
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:33,411
You chase it long enough, you pick it up.

356
00:32:45,173 --> 00:32:46,716
Excuse me.

357
00:33:02,983 --> 00:33:04,901
- (phone rings)
- Mulder.

358
00:33:04,985 --> 00:33:06,570
- Mulder, it's me.
- Hi.

359
00:33:06,736 --> 00:33:11,158
Those other two names that you said
that Fellig went by - Strand and Rice?

360
00:33:11,867 --> 00:33:14,077
Yeah. Henry Strand and LH Rice.

361
00:33:14,161 --> 00:33:16,663
What about Louis Brady?

362
00:33:16,746 --> 00:33:21,960
Uh... no. But there's a big gap before 1939.

363
00:33:22,586 --> 00:33:25,088
(Scully) Will you check it out for me?

364
00:33:25,672 --> 00:33:28,800
I'm sticking here to
make sure he doesn't bolt.

365
00:33:29,551 --> 00:33:31,595
Louis Brady, Mulder.

366
00:33:31,761 --> 00:33:33,763
Tell me what you find out.

367
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,100
(hangs up ph0ne)

368
00:33:49,821 --> 00:33:51,948
Mr Fellig?

369
00:33:55,202 --> 00:34:00,248
Oops. Excuse me. I have a film out.
Hold on a second.

370
00:34:53,593 --> 00:34:55,178
(cellphone rings)

371
00:34:56,054 --> 00:34:58,139
- Ritter.
- It's Agent Mulder.

372
00:34:58,223 --> 00:35:02,519
- Is Agent Scully there with you?
- No. Nor do I seem to be able to find her.

373
00:35:02,602 --> 00:35:05,397
DC Cellular says her phone is turned off.

374
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:08,316
- What can I do for you?
- You can find her for me.

375
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:12,195
Listen, Agent Mulder, I'm
on my way to arrest Alfred Fellig.

376
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:13,989
That's where I think she is.

377
00:35:14,072 --> 00:35:17,534
And you were right. Fellig is a murderer -
under the name Louis Brady.

378
00:35:17,617 --> 00:35:22,330
He suffocated two patients in a hospital.
He says he meant to catch up with death.

379
00:35:22,414 --> 00:35:25,417
After one year in prison,
he walked off a work detail.

380
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,711
The manhunt never officially ceased.

381
00:35:27,877 --> 00:35:30,130
- When was this?
- 1929.

382
00:35:30,213 --> 00:35:31,715
Whoa-whoa-whoa. When?

383
00:35:31,798 --> 00:35:34,509
Look, Ritter, don't sweat the math. It's him.

384
00:35:34,592 --> 00:35:38,430
- Just get there and find Agent Scully.
- All right, I'm on it.

385
00:35:43,476 --> 00:35:46,396
You know, most people want to live for ever.

386
00:35:46,479 --> 00:35:48,606
Most people are idiots.

387
00:35:49,649 --> 00:35:51,651
Which is one of the reasons I don't.

388
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:53,737
I think you're wrong.

389
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,949
How can you have too much life?

390
00:36:00,076 --> 00:36:03,121
There's too much to learn, to experience.

391
00:36:03,246 --> 00:36:06,541
75 years... is enough.

392
00:36:07,834 --> 00:36:10,545
Take my word for it.

393
00:36:10,628 --> 00:36:15,216
You live for ever, you start to think
about the big thing you're missing

394
00:36:15,300 --> 00:36:19,262
and that everybody else
gets to find out about but you.

395
00:36:20,430 --> 00:36:21,890
What about love?

396
00:36:21,973 --> 00:36:24,059
What, does that last for ever?

397
00:36:26,186 --> 00:36:31,649
40 years ago, I drove down to the city hall,

398
00:36:31,733 --> 00:36:33,777
down to the hall of records.

399
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:39,074
Record archives, or whatever they call it.
I wanted to... look up my wife.

400
00:36:39,157 --> 00:36:44,287
It... bothered me
I couldn't remember her name.

401
00:36:46,664 --> 00:36:51,711
Love lasts... 75 years, if you're lucky.

402
00:36:53,088 --> 00:36:56,132
You don't want to be around when it's gone.

403
00:37:12,607 --> 00:37:15,110
Count your blessings.

404
00:37:28,748 --> 00:37:31,042
Why are you this way?

405
00:37:32,544 --> 00:37:37,465
I mean, if this is true, give me
something in the way of proof.

406
00:37:38,466 --> 00:37:41,553
Help me find some science
that I can hang this on.

407
00:37:41,636 --> 00:37:44,681
It has nothing to do with science.

408
00:37:44,764 --> 00:37:48,518
- Someone took my place.
- Took your place?

409
00:37:49,602 --> 00:37:51,688
I don't know her name.

410
00:37:53,189 --> 00:37:55,650
I don't think I ever knew it.

411
00:37:55,733 --> 00:38:01,197
I had yellow fever, way the hell back
then when it killed half of New York.

412
00:38:03,867 --> 00:38:07,954
Washington Square Park was
a common grave, they had so many bodies.

413
00:38:09,038 --> 00:38:11,124
They'd bury them shallow.

414
00:38:11,207 --> 00:38:13,668
They wrapped them in yellow sheets,

415
00:38:13,751 --> 00:38:16,671
and the yellow sheets would
stick up through the mud.

416
00:38:16,754 --> 00:38:20,258
I was in a city-run contagion ward.

417
00:38:20,383 --> 00:38:24,596
I was out of my head with fever,
out of my mind. Then I saw him.

418
00:38:24,679 --> 00:38:26,681
Saw Death.

419
00:38:26,764 --> 00:38:28,808
I wish I'd had a camera then.

420
00:38:28,892 --> 00:38:34,772
At first, I... I just saw him
out of the corner of my eye.

421
00:38:34,856 --> 00:38:38,401
Then he got bolder and he
started flitting around the room,

422
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:41,571
and he'd take this person,
then he'd take that person.

423
00:38:41,696 --> 00:38:44,991
And I never saw his face.
I didn't want to see his face.

424
00:38:45,074 --> 00:38:48,745
I figured if I saw it, he'd take me too.

425
00:38:50,413 --> 00:38:52,582
- But he didn't.
- No.

426
00:38:52,665 --> 00:38:55,418
There was a nurse.

427
00:38:55,502 --> 00:38:57,921
She did the best she could.

428
00:38:58,004 --> 00:39:00,173
Back then...

429
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:02,509
medical science was...

430
00:39:03,426 --> 00:39:06,054
They couldn't find their ass with both hands.

431
00:39:06,137 --> 00:39:11,726
But she did the best she could.
She sat with me and held my hand and...

432
00:39:11,809 --> 00:39:14,687
I was on my deathbed.

433
00:39:14,771 --> 00:39:18,149
Then he came for me. I didn't look at him.

434
00:39:18,274 --> 00:39:21,402
Closed my eyes and turned my head.

435
00:39:21,486 --> 00:39:25,406
I didn't tell her not to look at him.
I wanted her to look at him.

436
00:39:25,490 --> 00:39:29,827
I wanted her to look at him, instead of me.

437
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:34,916
And then I came to, and the fever broke.

438
00:39:36,376 --> 00:39:39,963
They were carrying her out,
wrapped up in a yellow sheet.

439
00:39:42,173 --> 00:39:46,135
Since that time, I realised you
gotta be careful what you wish for.

440
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:50,056
I missed my chance.

441
00:39:50,932 --> 00:39:53,726
You're very lucky, you know that?

442
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:56,062
What do you mean?

443
00:39:59,941 --> 00:40:01,484
Wait a minute.

444
00:40:03,611 --> 00:40:07,574
Say what's on your mind.
You mean "lucky" like the others?

445
00:40:07,657 --> 00:40:09,867
You want me to believe I'm about to die?

446
00:40:09,951 --> 00:40:12,453
I just want to take the picture.

447
00:40:12,537 --> 00:40:14,747
You took my picture last night.

448
00:40:14,831 --> 00:40:17,000
- Is this why?
- That was different.

449
00:40:17,083 --> 00:40:19,419
I'm not gonna die!

450
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:23,089
- (camera flash charging)
- Turn that off.

451
00:40:23,172 --> 00:40:26,092
- No.
- Turn it off right now! Put it down!

452
00:40:26,175 --> 00:40:28,344
There's nothing to be done for it.

453
00:40:40,815 --> 00:40:45,236
- You took my phone. Why?
- Please. Just give me a chance.

454
00:40:45,361 --> 00:40:48,698
- What don't you want me to know?
- He's coming.

455
00:40:48,781 --> 00:40:51,618
- And you should just make your peace.
- Shut up!

456
00:40:53,369 --> 00:40:55,997
(Crash)

457
00:40:56,581 --> 00:40:58,249
He's here.

458
00:40:58,374 --> 00:40:59,917
(camera flash charging)

459
00:41:21,564 --> 00:41:23,650
Agent?

460
00:41:32,075 --> 00:41:34,410
Oh God. No, no, no.

461
00:41:34,494 --> 00:41:38,081
No.No.No.No.No.No.

462
00:41:40,458 --> 00:41:42,919
Come on. Come on, dammit.

463
00:41:43,294 --> 00:41:44,921
(gasping)

464
00:41:45,463 --> 00:41:48,091
I'll get help. We need some help in here!

465
00:42:25,002 --> 00:42:27,088
Do you see him?

466
00:42:29,132 --> 00:42:31,342
Do you see him?

467
00:42:35,054 --> 00:42:37,140
Don't look.

468
00:42:38,099 --> 00:42:39,934
Close your eyes.

469
00:43:38,034 --> 00:43:40,536
You're a lucky man.

470
00:43:56,052 --> 00:44:00,890
The coroner's report came back on Fellig.
It says he died of a single gunshot wound.

471
00:44:00,973 --> 00:44:03,392
That's all it said.

472
00:44:04,769 --> 00:44:09,899
I... talked to your doctor
and he says you're doin' great.

473
00:44:09,982 --> 00:44:13,110
You're makin' the fastest
recovery he's ever seen.

474
00:44:15,112 --> 00:44:19,116
You know, Mulder, I don't even know
how I entertained the thought.

475
00:44:21,577 --> 00:44:23,621
People don't live for ever.

476
00:44:23,746 --> 00:44:26,749
No, no. I think he would have.

477
00:44:27,583 --> 00:44:30,753
I just think that death only looks for you...

478
00:44:32,547 --> 00:44:35,258
once you seek its opposite.
