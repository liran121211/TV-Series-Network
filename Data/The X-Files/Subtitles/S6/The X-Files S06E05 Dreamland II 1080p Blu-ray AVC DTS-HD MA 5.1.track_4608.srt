- What are we doing here?
- Stakeout.

9
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,130
- On Christmas Eve?
- It's an important date.

10
00:00:45,255 --> 00:00:47,466
- No kidding.
- Important to why we're here.

Turn off your car
and I'll fill you in on the details.

12
00:00:50,802 --> 00:00:56,058
Mulder, I've got wrapping to do.
It's the night before Christmas.

13
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:57,476
Oh.

14
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:11,907
Let's hear it. Give me the details.

15
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:15,327
If you've got Christmas stuff to do...

16
00:01:15,452 --> 00:01:18,997
Mulder, I drove all the way out here.
I might as well know why.

17
00:01:19,081 --> 00:01:22,584
I just thought you'd be more... curious.

18
00:01:22,668 --> 00:01:25,087
- Who lives in the house?
- No one.

19
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:27,589
- Who are we staking out?
- The former occupants.

20
00:01:27,673 --> 00:01:30,467
- They've come back?
- That's the story.

21
00:01:32,511 --> 00:01:34,346

22
00:01:35,013 --> 00:01:41,603
The dark gothic manor, the omnipresent
low fog hugging the thicket of overgrowth...

23
00:01:42,813 --> 00:01:46,858
Wait. Is that a hound I hear
baying out in the moors?

24
00:01:46,942 --> 00:01:49,695
No, actually that was a left-cheek sneak.

25
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:54,199
Tell me you didn't call me out here on
Christmas Eve to go ghost-busting with you.

26
00:01:54,324 --> 00:01:57,119
- They're called apparitions.
- Call it what you want.

27
00:01:57,202 --> 00:01:59,204
I've got holiday cheer to spread.

28
00:01:59,329 --> 00:02:03,458
I've got a family roll call
under the tree at 6am.

29
00:02:03,542 --> 00:02:07,462
- I'll make it fast. I'll just give you the details.
- <i>(sighing)</i> OK.

30
00:02:07,546 --> 00:02:09,381
Christmas 1917.

31
00:02:09,506 --> 00:02:12,217
It was a time of dark, dark despair.

32
00:02:12,301 --> 00:02:15,887
American soldiers were dying
at an ungodly rate in war-torn Europe,

33
00:02:16,013 --> 00:02:20,058
while at home a deadly strain of
the flu virus attacked young and old alike.

34
00:02:20,142 --> 00:02:22,227
Tragedy visited every doorstep.

35
00:02:22,311 --> 00:02:25,147
Hopelessness set in with
every man, woman and child.

36
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,566
It was a time of dark, dark despair.

37
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:29,818
You said that.

38
00:02:29,901 --> 00:02:33,905
But here at 1501 Larkspur Lane,
for a pair of star-crossed lovers

39
00:02:34,031 --> 00:02:38,827
tragedy came not from war or pestilence,
not by the boot heel of the bombardier,

40
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,371
but by their own innocent hand.

41
00:02:43,707 --> 00:02:45,417
- Go on.
- His name was Maurice.

42
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,338
He was a brooding but heroic
young man, beloved of Lyda,

43
00:02:49,421 --> 00:02:53,342
a sublime beauty with a light that
followed her wherever she went.

44
00:02:53,425 --> 00:02:57,179
They were like two angels from heaven
whom the gods could not protect

45
00:02:57,262 --> 00:03:01,600
from the horrors being visited
upon this cold, grey earth.

46
00:03:01,725 --> 00:03:03,602
And what happened to them?

47
00:03:03,685 --> 00:03:08,357
Driven by a tragic fear of separation,
they forged a lovers' pact

48
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:11,026
so that they might spend eternity together

49
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:13,695
and not spend one precious Christmas apart.

50
00:03:13,779 --> 00:03:16,031
They killed themselves?

51
00:03:16,114 --> 00:03:20,035
And their ghosts haunt this house
every Christmas Eve.

52
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,206
I just gave myself chills.

53
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:28,460
It's a good story, Mulder,
and very well told, but I don't believe it.

54
00:03:28,543 --> 00:03:30,379
You don't believe in ghosts?

55
00:03:30,462 --> 00:03:33,298
- That surprises you?
- Well... yeah.

56
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:35,550
I thought everybody believed in ghosts.

57
00:03:35,634 --> 00:03:38,887
If it were any other night,
I might let you talk me into it,

58
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,473
but the halls are decked and I gotta go.

59
00:03:46,728 --> 00:03:49,981
- My best to the family.
- What are you doing?

60
00:03:51,566 --> 00:03:55,821
- Don't you have somewhere to be?
- I'm just gonna take a look.

61
00:04:02,411 --> 00:04:06,248
I'm not gonna do it.
My New Year's resolution.

Change your mind?

65
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:45,036
- Did you take my car keys?
- No.

66
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,123
- Don't kid around.
- Why would I take your car keys?

67
00:04:48,206 --> 00:04:50,292
Maybe you, uh...

68
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,714
- Maybe you grabbed them by mistake.
- Maybe it was a ghost.

There must be a window open upstairs.

The weather report said there was
an 80% chance of rain, maybe even...

- There's nothing to be afraid of.
- I'm not afraid, OK?

- Ghosts are benevolent entities.
- (thud)

Mostly.

85
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:58,295
You are not scaring me, Mulder.

86
00:07:07,095 --> 00:07:10,849
Look, I really have to get home.

87
00:07:19,858 --> 00:07:22,068
- Mulder.
- Shh!

88
00:07:22,152 --> 00:07:26,489
- (whispering) What was that?
- These are tricks that the mind plays.

89
00:07:26,573 --> 00:07:30,410
They are ingrained cliches from
a thousand different horror films.

90
00:07:30,493 --> 00:07:35,040
When we hear a sound, we get a chill.
We see a shadow and imagine something

91
00:07:35,123 --> 00:07:39,461
that an otherwise rational person
would discount out of hand.

92
00:07:41,254 --> 00:07:43,590
I mean, the whole... Mulder?

93
00:07:43,673 --> 00:07:48,136
The whole idea of a benevolent entity
fits perfectly with what I'm saying.

94
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:51,598
That a spirit would materialise
or return for no other purpose

95
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:54,184
than to show itself is silly and ridiculous.

96
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:57,437
What it shows is how silly
and ridiculous we have become

97
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,606
in believing such things.

98
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:04,235
I mean, that we can ignore all
natural laws about the corporeal body,

99
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,948
that we witness these spirits
clad in their own shabby outfits,

100
00:08:09,032 --> 00:08:12,118
with the same old haircuts and hairstyles,

101
00:08:12,202 --> 00:08:16,039
ne ver ageing, never in search
of more comfortable surroundings...

102
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:19,084
It actually says more about
the living than the dead.

103
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:22,545
- Mm-hm.
- It doesn't take a degree in psychology

104
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:27,967
to understand the unconscious
yearnings that these imaginings satisfy.

105
00:08:28,051 --> 00:08:31,221
You know, the longing for immortality,

106
00:08:31,304 --> 00:08:34,432
the hope that there is something
beyond this mortal coil,

107
00:08:34,516 --> 00:08:36,810
that we'll never be
without our loved ones...

108
00:08:36,893 --> 00:08:40,438
I mean, these are powerful, powerful desires.

109
00:08:40,522 --> 00:08:46,069
They're the very essence of what makes us
human. The essence of Christmas, actually.

here, but that somebody might live here?

No one lives here.

in the car, there was not a light on...

118

00:10:45,188 --> 00:10:48,024
It's not enough that it's haunted?
It has to be cursed?

128
00:10:48,107 --> 00:10:50,985
Every couple that's lived here
has met a tragic end.

129
00:10:51,069 --> 00:10:55,240

00:16:15,852 --> 00:16:19,021
- Have you looked at the door?
- I'm looking at it now.

173
00:16:19,105 --> 00:16:21,149
Tell me what you see.

174
00:16:21,232 --> 00:16:24,193
I see a door with the lock shot off it.

175
00:16:25,236 --> 00:16:27,405
You gonna pay for that?

176
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:31,492
That's a door with a brick wall behind it.

177
00:16:31,576 --> 00:16:33,870
OK, sure.

178
00:16:34,996 --> 00:16:36,914
You're playing tricks on me.

179
00:16:36,998 --> 00:16:40,209
If I am, I'm sorry, but I don't know any tricks.

180
00:16:40,293 --> 00:16:42,628
Well, that's a trick in itself.

181
00:16:42,712 --> 00:16:45,756
You've been playing tricks
on us since we got here.

182
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:48,509
Am I to take it we're not alone?

183
00:16:49,760 --> 00:16:52,680
Ah, that's very funny, coming from a ghost.

184
00:16:57,101 --> 00:16:58,978
Yeah, yeah...

185
00:16:59,437 --> 00:17:04,817
The gun fooled me a little at first.
You're a ghost hunter, huh?

186
00:17:04,901 --> 00:17:07,445
And you think I'm a ghost, huh?

187
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:11,699
Well, I've seen a lot of strange folks
come around here

188
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:13,993
with a lot of strange equipment,

189
00:17:14,076 --> 00:17:17,121
but I think you must be
the first I've seen come armed.

190
00:17:18,247 --> 00:17:20,249
- Strange folks?
- Mm-hm.

191
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,752
Like those folks under the floorb...

192
00:17:28,758 --> 00:17:32,428
- How did you do that?
- I didn't do anything.

193
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:37,266
There were corpses here,
bodies buried under the floorboards.

194
00:17:39,435 --> 00:17:41,604
Why don't you have a seat, son?

195
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:54,116
- You drink? Take drugs?
- No.

196
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,160
- Get high?
- No.

197
00:17:56,244 --> 00:18:01,249
Are you overcome by the impulse
to make everyone believe you?

198
00:18:05,461 --> 00:18:07,588
I'm in the field of mental health.

199
00:18:07,672 --> 00:18:10,841
I specialise in disorders and manias

200
00:18:10,925 --> 00:18:15,680
related to pathological behaviour
as it pertains to the paranormal.

201
00:18:17,139 --> 00:18:20,184
Wow. I didn't know such a thing existed.

202
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:25,523
My speciality is in what I call
soul prospectors,

203
00:18:25,606 --> 00:18:29,193
a cross-axial classification I've codified

204
00:18:29,277 --> 00:18:33,781
by extensive interaction
with visitors like yourself.

205
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:39,328
I've found you all tend to fall into
pretty much the same category.

206
00:18:39,412 --> 00:18:41,205
Hm. What category is that?

207
00:18:41,289 --> 00:18:46,127
Narcissistic, overzealous,
self-righteous egomaniac.

208
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:48,296
That's a category?

209
00:18:48,379 --> 00:18:52,049
You kindly think of yourself
as single-minded,

210
00:18:52,133 --> 00:18:55,344
but you're prone to
obsessive compulsiveness,

211
00:18:55,428 --> 00:18:59,056
workaholism, antisocialism.

212
00:18:59,140 --> 00:19:05,187
Fertile fields for the descent
into total wacko breakdown.

213
00:19:05,271 --> 00:19:07,857
I don't think that pegs me exactly.

214
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:13,446
Oh, really?
Waving a gun around my house? Huh?

215
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:17,783
Raving like a lunatic about
some imaginary brick wall?

216
00:19:21,454 --> 00:19:26,042
You've probably convinced
yourself you've seen aliens.

217
00:19:27,001 --> 00:19:31,339
You know why you think
you see the things you do?

218
00:19:32,548 --> 00:19:35,968
Because I have seen them?

219
00:19:36,052 --> 00:19:37,928
Cos you're a lonely man.

220
00:19:38,012 --> 00:19:40,890
A lonely man...

221
00:19:40,973 --> 00:19:44,602
chasing para-masturbatory illusions

222
00:19:44,685 --> 00:19:48,189
that you believe will give your life
meaning and significance,

223
00:19:48,272 --> 00:19:51,067
which your pathetic social maladjustment

224
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:54,445
makes impossible for you to find elsewhere.

225
00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:03,204
You probably consider yourself passionate,
serious, misunderstood. Am I right?

226
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:06,957
Para-masturbatory?

227
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:11,295
Most people would rather stick a finger
in a wall socket than spend time with you.

228
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:14,382
All right. Just back off for a second.

229
00:20:14,465 --> 00:20:17,718
- You spend every Christmas alone?
- I'm not alone.

230
00:20:18,844 --> 00:20:22,014
- More self-delusion.
- No. I came with my partner.

231
00:20:22,098 --> 00:20:25,810
- She's somewhere in the house.
- Behind a brick wall?

232
00:20:26,143 --> 00:20:29,730
How'd you get her to come
with you, steal her car keys?

233
00:20:31,732 --> 00:20:33,943
You know why you do it.

234
00:20:34,026 --> 00:20:37,863
Listen endlessly to her
droning rationalisations.

235
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:43,035
Because you're afraid.
Afraid of the loneliness.

236
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:46,997
Am I right?

237
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:54,255
I'd just like to find my partner.

238
00:20:54,964 --> 00:20:57,550
Good. Easy.

239
00:20:59,593 --> 00:21:01,679
Piece of cake.

240
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:11,355
Brick wall?

241
00:21:12,857 --> 00:21:14,984
Or brick wall?

242
00:21:15,401 --> 00:21:18,612
Go ahead. Change your life.

243
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:34,587
Mulder?

244
00:21:45,723 --> 00:21:47,892
- Aaargh!
- Aaargh!

245
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:51,187
No, please! I won't hurt you.

246
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,647
- I'm a federal agent! I'm armed!
- You're what?

247
00:21:53,731 --> 00:21:55,191
- I'm armed!
- You said...

248
00:21:55,274 --> 00:21:57,401
- I'm armed!
- You're a federal agent?

249
00:21:57,485 --> 00:22:00,905
Please, I'm a little on edge!
Don't come any closer!

250
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:05,618
My name is Special Agent Dana Scully,
and,uh,lcan“.

251
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:08,996
I can show you my ID.

252
00:22:09,079 --> 00:22:12,500
(chuckling) Oh, my goodness.
I thought you were a ghost.

253
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:16,795
I can assure you that I'm not.
I got stuck here looking for my partner.

254
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:20,257
Oh, the gangly fellow
with the distinguished profile?

255
00:22:20,341 --> 00:22:22,927
- You've seen him?
- With you in the foyer.

256
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:25,221
I thought he was a ghost, too.

257
00:22:25,304 --> 00:22:27,640
<i>(Sighing) on.</i>

258
00:22:27,723 --> 00:22:29,767
- That was you.
- I sleepwalk.

259
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:33,479
I thought maybe I dreamed it.
But then here you were again.

260
00:22:33,562 --> 00:22:36,524
I am sorry. I'm sorry.

261
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:40,027
I didn't mean to scare you. I, uh...

262
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:42,112
It's just that we found bodies.

263
00:22:42,196 --> 00:22:44,114
Bodies? Where?

264
00:22:44,198 --> 00:22:45,991
Right...

265
00:22:52,498 --> 00:22:55,000
You look like you saw a ghost.

266
00:22:55,709 --> 00:22:58,420
There are ghosts in this house, you know.

267
00:23:00,089 --> 00:23:02,424
<i>(rumble of thunder)</i>

268
00:23:03,926 --> 00:23:05,803
Who are you?

269
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:09,431
I live here, thank you very much.

270
00:23:09,515 --> 00:23:13,227
- Where's my partner?
- Why are you pointing that gun?

271
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:16,146
There were corpses underneath the floor!

272
00:23:17,231 --> 00:23:19,316
<i>(chuckles)</i>

273
00:23:21,944 --> 00:23:24,697
I think the ghosts have been
playing tricks on you.

274
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,949
I don't believe in ghosts.

275
00:23:30,661 --> 00:23:33,163
Then what are you doing here?

276
00:23:34,248 --> 00:23:36,292
Where's my partner?

277
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:41,255
- He believes in ghosts?
- Yeah.

278
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:43,841
Oh, you poor child.

279
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:49,513
You must have an awful small life,
spending your Christmas Eve with him,

280
00:23:49,597 --> 00:23:52,474
chasing things you don't even believe in.

281
00:23:52,558 --> 00:23:54,893
Don't come any closer.

282
00:23:54,977 --> 00:23:57,146
I can see it in your face - the fear,

283
00:23:57,229 --> 00:23:59,940
the conflicted yearnings,

284
00:24:00,024 --> 00:24:04,278
the subconscious desire
to find fulfilment through another.

285
00:24:04,361 --> 00:24:06,864
Intimacy through codependency.

286
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:07,990
What?

287
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:10,826
Maybe you repress the truth
about why you're here,

288
00:24:10,909 --> 00:24:13,537
pretending it's out of duty or loyalty,

289
00:24:13,621 --> 00:24:16,665
unable to admit your dirty little secret:

290
00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:19,543
your only joy in life is proving him wrong.

291
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:22,671
You don't know me.

292
00:24:22,755 --> 00:24:25,507
And you don't live here!
This isn't your house!

293
00:24:25,591 --> 00:24:28,177
You wouldn't think so,
the way I'm being treated.

294
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,472
- Then why is the furniture covered?
- We're painting the house.

295
00:24:31,555 --> 00:24:34,516
- Where's your Christmas tree?!
- We're Jewish. Boo!

296
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,267
<i>(door creaking)</i>

297
00:24:36,268 --> 00:24:39,355
Hold it right there!
Don't make me shoot you!

298
00:24:39,438 --> 00:24:41,815
Just stay where you are!

299
00:24:41,899 --> 00:24:44,193
We really attract 'em, don't we?

300
00:24:45,569 --> 00:24:48,197
- Where's Mulder?
- Mulder? Is that his name?

301
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,366
- Where is he?
- He'll be along.

302
00:24:53,035 --> 00:24:57,081
Move over there!
Both of you, move over there.

303
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:00,000
Move over there!

304
00:25:00,084 --> 00:25:03,003
This violates our civil rights.

305
00:25:03,087 --> 00:25:05,422
I have friends at the ACLU.

306
00:25:05,506 --> 00:25:07,716
Put your hands up.

307
00:25:41,709 --> 00:25:43,293
<i>(thud)</i>

308
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:48,048
You see what we've resorted to?
Gimmicks and cheap tricks.

309
00:25:48,841 --> 00:25:50,592
We used to be so good at this.

310
00:25:50,676 --> 00:25:55,222
We used to have years to drive them mad.
Now we get one night.

311
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:59,059
This pop psychology approach is crap.
All it does is annoy them.

312
00:25:59,143 --> 00:26:03,313
- When's the last time we haunted anyone?
- When did we last have a double murder?

313
00:26:03,397 --> 00:26:05,482
Not since the house was condemned.

314
00:26:05,566 --> 00:26:08,318
This is embarrassing. Amateur, kid stuff.

315
00:26:09,236 --> 00:26:11,488
Look, if we let our reputation slip,

316
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:14,366
they're gonna take us
off the tourist literature.

317
00:26:14,450 --> 00:26:16,702
Last year, no one even showed up.

318
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:20,831
Of all clays, why did you pick Christmas?
Why not Halloween?

319
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:26,170
Now, who is filled with hopelessness
and futility on Halloween?

320
00:26:26,253 --> 00:26:28,881
Christmas comes but once a year.

321
00:26:30,215 --> 00:26:32,217
You're right.

322
00:26:33,177 --> 00:26:36,805
These two do seem pretty miserable.

323
00:26:36,889 --> 00:26:42,478
We need to show them
just how lonely Christmas can be.

324
00:26:42,561 --> 00:26:45,397
Now that's the old yuletide spirit.

325
00:26:49,151 --> 00:26:51,487
<i>Oh... (laughs)</i>

326
00:26:55,449 --> 00:26:57,701
<i>(grunting)</i>

327
00:27:16,178 --> 00:27:19,932
- Are you Agent Mulder?
- Who are you, now?

328
00:27:20,015 --> 00:27:22,518
What are you doing
using my chair for a ladder?

329
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:25,437
- Trying to get out of this room.
- Trying to get out?

330
00:27:25,521 --> 00:27:28,690
- Excuse me.
- No, no, you can't get out that way.

331
00:27:38,784 --> 00:27:41,286
- Masher.
- Frump.

332
00:27:43,914 --> 00:27:47,626
I don't know who you're calling a frump,
but I don't appreciate that.

333
00:27:47,709 --> 00:27:52,381
Being manhandled or called names.
Certainly not at this hour.

334
00:27:52,464 --> 00:27:55,342
- You're a ghost.
- Oh, more names!

335
00:27:59,096 --> 00:28:03,642
- What happened to the star-crossed lovers?
- The romance is the first thing to go.

336
00:28:05,394 --> 00:28:07,312
It's you.

337
00:28:08,355 --> 00:28:11,191
You're Lyda. And that was Maurice.

338
00:28:12,568 --> 00:28:14,444
But you've... aged.

339
00:28:14,528 --> 00:28:18,198
I hope your partner finds you
a lot more charming than I do.

340
00:28:23,871 --> 00:28:25,873
Let's see. Where is it?

There it is.

343
00:28:42,472 --> 00:28:45,851
I was young and beautiful once,
just like your partner.

344
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:54,651
Whoo!

345
00:28:54,735 --> 00:28:57,529
Look at us. Maurice was so handsome.

346
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:04,119
He didn't have a gut.

347
00:29:08,665 --> 00:29:11,960
I hope you're not expecting
great advantages to all this.

348
00:29:12,044 --> 00:29:13,253
To all what?

349
00:29:13,337 --> 00:29:16,214
I assume you came here
with similar misconceptions.

350
00:29:16,298 --> 00:29:18,967
- We came here looking for you.
- Oh, yeah?

351
00:29:19,051 --> 00:29:22,054
You didn't come here
to be together for eternity?

352
00:29:23,597 --> 00:29:24,723
<i>(chuckling) No.</i>

353
00:29:24,806 --> 00:29:28,810
Because you're filled with despair
and woeful Christmas melancholy?

354
00:29:28,894 --> 00:29:33,482
- Why?
- <i>(sighs)</i> Maybe it was your partner, then.

355
00:29:34,107 --> 00:29:35,442
What about her?

356
00:29:35,525 --> 00:29:38,737
- You knew this house was haunted.
- Yeah.

357
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:42,991
Maybe you two should have discussed
your real feelings before you came here.

358
00:29:43,075 --> 00:29:45,118
I'm speaking from experience.

359
00:29:46,161 --> 00:29:49,206
- What experience?
- I'm not gonna get into semantics.

360
00:29:49,289 --> 00:29:53,543
- A murder/suicide is all about trust.
- I thought you had a lovers' pact.

361
00:29:53,627 --> 00:29:54,670
<i>(laughs)</i>

362
00:29:54,753 --> 00:29:58,840
Poetic allusions aside, the outcome,
Mulder, is pretty much the same.

- Why are you showing it to me?

365
00:30:05,472 --> 00:30:09,559
It isn't like you're gonna be eating
any Christmas ham, is it?

366
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,980
You're telling me that
Scully's gonna shoot me?

367
00:30:13,063 --> 00:30:15,732
Scully is not going to shoot me.

368
00:30:15,816 --> 00:30:17,484
Suit yourself.

369
00:30:17,567 --> 00:30:20,570
But if you shoot first,
for her the rest is an act of faith.

370
00:30:20,654 --> 00:30:23,281
- I wouldn't shoot her.
- Maybe she shoots herself.

371
00:30:23,365 --> 00:30:25,450
I wouldn't let her.

372
00:30:26,576 --> 00:30:29,579
The bodies under the floor...

373
00:30:29,663 --> 00:30:33,375
Maybe that was just some
kind of Jungian symbolism.

374
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:36,837
Or maybe... there's a <i>secret</i> lovers' pact.

375
00:30:38,005 --> 00:30:39,965
We're not lovers.

376
00:30:40,048 --> 00:30:42,843
And this isn't a pure science.

377
00:30:42,926 --> 00:30:46,596
But you're both so attractive.

378
00:30:46,930 --> 00:30:50,058
And there'll be a lot of time to work that out.

379
00:30:50,142 --> 00:30:52,144
Go ahead. Take it.

380
00:30:52,227 --> 00:30:53,353
Take it.

381
00:30:55,313 --> 00:30:59,234
Think of it as the last Christmas
you'll ever spend alone.

383
00:31:41,985 --> 00:31:45,155
- For your protection.
- Stay away from me.

384
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:48,742
Look, I want you to get me out of here.

385
00:31:48,825 --> 00:31:52,329
- I am quite capable of pulling this trigger.
- I'm glad to hear it.

386
00:31:52,412 --> 00:31:56,166
You may well have to defend yourself
against your crazy partner.

387
00:31:56,249 --> 00:31:58,126
What have you done with him?

388
00:31:58,210 --> 00:32:02,506
Kept him safe from his own
mad devices - at least, for now.

389
00:32:02,589 --> 00:32:06,510
You have any idea why
he brought you here to this house?

390
00:32:06,593 --> 00:32:10,514
Look, all I know is this is just some
bad dream. This is all in my head.

391
00:32:10,597 --> 00:32:14,059
And yet here you are, waving
a gun at me like your partner.

392
00:32:14,142 --> 00:32:16,645
- <i>(pounding on door)</i>
<i>- (Mulder) Scully!</i>

393

Do you realise how seriously
disturbed that man is?

394
00:32:22,651 --> 00:32:26,655
How dark and lonely?
What he's capable of?

395

396

Where did you get those?

398
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:42,337
He's got nowhere to go this Christmas
and no one to go with.

399
00:32:42,420 --> 00:32:46,508
Did he happen to mention
a story about a lovers' pact?

400
00:32:47,676 --> 00:32:49,553
Where did you get those keys?

401
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:53,348
The man is acting out
an unconscious yearning.

402
00:32:53,431 --> 00:32:56,893
The deep-seated terror of being alone.

There's no way home.

416
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:14,930
Don't come any closer. You're scaring me.

I'm not gonna shoot you.
I don't wanna shoot you!

It's me or you, you or me.
One of us has to do it.

420

Mulder, look. We don't have to do this.

421
00:34:28,652 --> 00:34:30,987
- Oh, yes, we do!
- We can get out of here.

422
00:34:31,071 --> 00:34:35,283
Even if we could, what's waiting for us?
More loneliness!

423

And then 365 more shopping days
till even more loneliness!

- <i>(sighs)</i> Can I come in?
- Yeah.

513
00:41:59,602 --> 00:42:03,606
Aren't you supposed to be opening
Christmas gifts with your family?

514
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:08,528
Mulder... none of that
really happened out there tonight.

515
00:42:09,362 --> 00:42:11,447
That was all in our heads, right?

516
00:42:13,533 --> 00:42:15,410
It must have been.

517
00:42:21,958 --> 00:42:25,586
Not that my only joy in life
is proving you wrong.

518
00:42:26,337 --> 00:42:28,589
When have you proven me wrong?

519
00:42:32,468 --> 00:42:35,346
Well, why else would you want me
out there with you?

520
00:42:35,471 --> 00:42:37,849
You didn't wanna be there?

521
00:42:39,851 --> 00:42:41,728
Oh, that's, um...

522
00:42:42,937 --> 00:42:48,401
That's self-righteous and...
narcissistic of me to say, isn't it?

523
00:42:48,484 --> 00:42:51,112
No, I mean...

524
00:42:51,195 --> 00:42:53,948
maybe I did want to be out there with you.

525
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:00,955
You know...

526
00:43:01,789 --> 00:43:04,959
I know we said that we weren't
going to exchange gifts,

527
00:43:05,042 --> 00:43:10,798
but, uh... I got you a little something.

528
00:43:12,759 --> 00:43:15,303
- Mulder...
- Merry Christmas.

529
00:43:16,971 --> 00:43:20,391
- I <i>got you</i> a little <i>something too.</i>
- <i>(chuckling)</i> Oh...

530
00:43:26,814 --> 00:43:32,779

531
00:43:32,862 --> 00:43:38,826
