1
00:00:03,088 --> 00:00:08,093
(doctor) It's important that you realise
sonograms are by no means an exact science.

2
00:00:08,177 --> 00:00:11,513
I don't want to alarm you
or have you jump to conclusions,

3
00:00:11,597 --> 00:00:15,058
because it's not something
we're perfectly able to explain.

4
00:00:15,142 --> 00:00:17,269
But I don't see anything.

5
00:00:17,352 --> 00:00:20,647
As I said, we may be
premature in the diagnosis.

6
00:00:20,772 --> 00:00:23,150
It may simply be...

7
00:00:23,275 --> 00:00:26,195
an intermediate stage of growth.

8
00:00:26,278 --> 00:00:28,363
But there's a problem.

9
00:00:29,114 --> 00:00:31,241
We see a development.

10
00:00:31,325 --> 00:00:35,412
An abnormal bony formation
involving the upper vertebrae

11
00:00:35,495 --> 00:00:38,999
and something growing here
on the plates of the skull.

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,295
<i>Wayne'?</i>

13
00:00:51,136 --> 00:00:53,305
Sweetness?

14
00:00:57,976 --> 00:01:00,062
It might be nothing.

15
00:01:01,313 --> 00:01:05,484
I'm serious. Dr Couvillion
really just wants to wait and see.

16
00:01:08,528 --> 00:01:12,491
I just... want it to be normal.

17
00:01:13,075 --> 00:01:15,744
Oh! Wayne.

18
00:01:17,537 --> 00:01:20,040
Let's go home, OK?

19
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:22,668
Come on.

20
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:56,410
Thank you.

21
00:02:11,717 --> 00:02:13,802
I love you, Laura.

22
00:02:15,554 --> 00:02:17,639
No matter what.

23
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:21,226
You know that?

24
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:24,104
Poopydoo?

25
00:02:26,106 --> 00:02:28,233
I know.

26
00:02:32,571 --> 00:02:34,656
Good night, Wayne.

27
00:02:36,325 --> 00:02:38,410
Good night, Laura.

28
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:43,749
Sweet dreams.

29
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,608
<i>(Laura) Wayne!</i>

30
00:03:10,776 --> 00:03:12,694
VVayne!

31
00:03:12,778 --> 00:03:14,404
<i>(growling)</i>

32
00:03:14,488 --> 00:03:16,865
Please!

33
00:03:17,783 --> 00:03:19,993
What are you doing?!

34
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:22,162
<i>(snarling)</i>

35
00:03:22,287 --> 00:03:24,247
Stop it!

36
00:03:24,331 --> 00:03:26,958
Wayne! Where are you?!

37
00:03:30,337 --> 00:03:35,050
Stop him! Please don't take my baby!

38
00:03:37,469 --> 00:03:40,097
Please don't take my baby!

39
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,890
VVayne!

40
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:44,059
- Wayne!
- Laura?

41
00:03:44,142 --> 00:03:48,188
- My baby!
- Laura, it's OK. You're having a dream.

42
00:03:50,816 --> 00:03:53,568
- It was terrible.
- It's OK. Shh.

43
00:03:53,652 --> 00:03:55,362
Oh!

44
00:03:57,864 --> 00:04:01,660
It was... trying to steal our baby.

45
00:05:10,729 --> 00:05:15,025
It's not the kind of case where I quite
know where to turn, you understand.

46
00:05:15,108 --> 00:05:18,737
Down in Hollins,
we do get our share of the oddball.

47
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:21,823
But we're pretty much
like any other little town.

48
00:05:21,907 --> 00:05:26,453
You got your home break-ins,
your smash-and-grabs. Nothing too wild.

49
00:05:27,496 --> 00:05:33,418
But given the victim's statement,
the unusually vivid detail...

50
00:05:33,502 --> 00:05:38,131
Well, I just had to take Laura's word
about her baby being abducted.

51
00:05:38,256 --> 00:05:44,179
- I hear you specialise in this kind of case.
- You've come to the right place, Deputy...

52
00:05:44,262 --> 00:05:47,974
Stevens. Now, this woman making
these claims, she's your sister?

53
00:05:48,099 --> 00:05:53,522
Yes, sir. Laura Weinsider. I've heard about the
things people have been saying about her.

54
00:05:53,605 --> 00:05:55,899
Not to my face, of course, but...

55
00:05:55,982 --> 00:06:00,904
real mean and awful things
about what Laura's part is in all this.

56
00:06:00,987 --> 00:06:05,784
It says here a doctor's report the day before
revealed abnormalities in the ultrasound.

57
00:06:05,867 --> 00:06:10,121
Yes, sir, that is true,
but nothing conclusive, mind you.

58
00:06:10,205 --> 00:06:12,457
I see.

59
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:17,712
OK, Deputy. We're gonna put this
right into our priority caseload.

60
00:06:17,796 --> 00:06:23,677
I really wanna thank you. Laura's itching
to talk to somebody who'll really listen to her.

61
00:06:51,746 --> 00:06:56,084
It went right into your caseload but I never
imagined you'd get here so soon, Agent...

62
00:06:56,167 --> 00:07:00,297
Mulder, Fox Mulder. Though I ask you
not to make that known to anybody.

63
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,675
The FBI likes to keep our work
on these cases very hush-hush.

64
00:07:03,758 --> 00:07:07,137
Sure, of course.
But I would like to thank Agent Spender.

65
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:09,431
Oh, no, no, no. I'll, uh...

66
00:07:09,514 --> 00:07:13,059
I'll thank him for you cos
I have to call in my progress report.

67
00:07:13,184 --> 00:07:16,938
- I hope you have something to call in.
- Oh, me too. All right.

68
00:07:24,613 --> 00:07:30,368
I kept calling it a nightmare, but how
many people's nightmares come true?

69
00:07:30,452 --> 00:07:32,537
Not many.

70
00:07:33,872 --> 00:07:36,708
Certainly not in the way yours did,
Mrs Weinsider.

71
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,877
When I was having it...

72
00:07:40,378 --> 00:07:43,131
it just seemed so real.

73
00:07:43,214 --> 00:07:48,970
You mentioned a fire in the room
in your account and a...

74
00:07:50,138 --> 00:07:53,183
a devil that held your legs?

75
00:07:53,266 --> 00:07:55,644
So that it could take the baby.

76
00:07:55,727 --> 00:07:59,731
But according to your statement,
your baby was not a normal baby.

77
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:03,443
No. It was some kind of monster...

78
00:08:04,736 --> 00:08:08,114
with, um, horns and a tail.

79
00:08:10,325 --> 00:08:12,952
Can you excuse me, please?

80
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:24,297
My wife appears so resilient,
but I know she's suffered

81
00:08:24,422 --> 00:08:27,967
ever since the doctor
told us about the complications.

82
00:08:29,094 --> 00:08:31,262
Um...

83
00:08:31,346 --> 00:08:37,268
You were right there in bed with your wife
the whole time, Mr Weinsider?

84
00:08:37,352 --> 00:08:39,270
Wayne. Yes, I woke her up.

85
00:08:39,354 --> 00:08:43,608
But according to your wife's statement,

86
00:08:43,692 --> 00:08:48,113
at one point, she... she reached
over for you in the bed

87
00:08:48,196 --> 00:08:50,949
and you... you weren't there.

88
00:08:53,201 --> 00:08:56,121
- Well, it was a dream.
- Yeah.

89
00:08:57,789 --> 00:09:00,792
Mind if I use your phone... Wayne?

90
00:09:02,502 --> 00:09:03,962
Sure, of course.

91
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:10,093
(Scully) Your truthfulness is important,
and as a prospective federal employee,

92
00:09:10,176 --> 00:09:14,431
I will remind you to answer
as honestly as possible. OK?

93
00:09:14,514 --> 00:09:17,100
<i>(man)</i> Sure. Fire away.

94
00:09:17,183 --> 00:09:19,936
(Scully) Do you or have you ever
smoked marijuana?

95
00:09:20,019 --> 00:09:22,522
No. No, sirree.

96
00:09:25,525 --> 00:09:29,487
Have you consorted with people
who have, now or in the past?

97
00:09:30,572 --> 00:09:34,826
No. I really don't think so.

98
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:42,417
<i>(phone rings)</i>

99
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:47,255
<i>- Scully.
- (Mulder) Hey, Scully, it's me.</i>

100
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:49,549
<i>(whispers) Would you mind?</i>

101
00:09:49,674 --> 00:09:53,511
Mulder, where are you?
I waited 45 minutes for you this morning.

102
00:09:53,595 --> 00:09:58,099
Before I tell you, I'm gonna
ask you to keep an open mind.

103
00:09:59,017 --> 00:10:01,227
- Not an X-File?
- Call it what you like.

104
00:10:01,352 --> 00:10:04,272
In Roanoke, they're calling it
a demon baby-snatching.

105
00:10:04,355 --> 00:10:07,817
- You're in Virginia?
- I want you to look at this woman's charts.

106
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:12,113
<i>Strange in utero deformities were detected.
I'll courier them to you.</i>

107
00:10:12,197 --> 00:10:17,243
Mulder, we are supposed to be doing
background checks, not chasing X-Files.

108
00:10:17,368 --> 00:10:19,954
Look, Spenderjust round-filed this case.

109
00:10:20,038 --> 00:10:23,875
<i>- It's unconscionable.
- What do you call rooting through his trash?</i>

110
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:26,336
That's like the assignment we're stuck with.

111
00:10:26,419 --> 00:10:30,465
We, Mulder? I'm stuck with! You're not here!

112
00:10:30,548 --> 00:10:33,968
Scully, this is a classic case
of demon fetal harvest.

113
00:10:34,052 --> 00:10:36,846
<i>What they called in the Middle Ages
"atum nocturnem".</i>

114
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:40,934
The impregnation of an unwitting woman
by a dark lord of the underworld.

115
00:10:41,059 --> 00:10:43,269
<i>(Scully) As host for his demon seed.</i>

116
00:10:43,394 --> 00:10:45,480
<i>(Mulder) Exactly.</i>

117
00:10:45,563 --> 00:10:48,066
<i>(Scully) I saw Rosemary's Baby on cable.</i>

118
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:52,070
<i>(Mulder) This is the real deal.
Check her charts, you'll get hard evidence.</i>

119
00:10:52,153 --> 00:10:55,198
<i>Check her prenatal ultrasound.
Just humour me, Scully.</i>

120
00:10:55,281 --> 00:10:59,786
<i>Take a look at those medical records.
I think they'll prove my theory.</i>

121
00:11:09,254 --> 00:11:11,589
Wayne, have you seen my nightgown?

122
00:11:12,632 --> 00:11:14,759
I can't find...

123
00:11:15,927 --> 00:11:17,345
<i>Wayne'?</i>

124
00:11:27,105 --> 00:11:29,148
<i>Wayne'?</i>

125
00:11:34,487 --> 00:11:35,822
VVayne!

126
00:11:44,289 --> 00:11:47,292
<i>(leaves rustle)</i>

127
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:27,832
<i>Wayne'?</i>

128
00:12:49,854 --> 00:12:51,230
<i>(gasps)</i>

129
00:12:51,356 --> 00:12:53,942
Laura? What are you doing?

130
00:12:54,025 --> 00:12:57,028
- What are you doing?
- Burning leaves.

131
00:12:58,529 --> 00:13:01,032
At this time of night?

132
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:03,618
You asked me to rake up the yard.

133
00:13:04,535 --> 00:13:07,038
It was in the job jar.

134
00:13:09,082 --> 00:13:12,210
Hey, come on. You're making me feel weird.

135
00:13:14,253 --> 00:13:19,050
- Come to bed, Wayne, please.
- I will, honey. I just wanted...

136
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:25,723
I just wanted everything to look perfect
when you woke up. I'll be right in.

137
00:14:14,355 --> 00:14:17,358
<i>(cellphone rings)</i>

138
00:14:24,323 --> 00:14:27,910
<i>- Mulder.
- I think I found what you're looking for.</i>

139
00:14:27,994 --> 00:14:32,040
I've been up all night going over
the medical charts on the Weinsider baby.

140
00:14:32,123 --> 00:14:33,583
What'd you find?

141
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:39,088
The prenatal birth defects that you spoke of-
they're all here, but they're subtle.

142
00:14:39,172 --> 00:14:43,676
- <i>Describe them</i> to me.
- They look to be discrete bony deformities.

143
00:14:43,801 --> 00:14:47,180
<i>There are spurs on
the superior aspect of the scapula</i>

144
00:14:47,305 --> 00:14:51,434
and small protuberances on the skull
adjacent to the coronal suture.

145
00:14:51,517 --> 00:14:56,522
<i>- Protuberances? You mean like horns?
- They could be recessive characteristics,</i>

146
00:14:56,647 --> 00:14:59,567
expressed as vestiges
of primitive morphology,

147
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:03,571
or a developmental anomaly
like craniosynostosis.

148
00:15:03,654 --> 00:15:06,199
Do you think it could be
passed along by the father?

149
00:15:06,324 --> 00:15:11,245
I wouldn't look to the father as any kind of
dark force here. I think it's the mother.

150
00:15:11,329 --> 00:15:16,459
Virginia law on third-trimester abortions
requires you to put her under arrest.

151
00:15:16,542 --> 00:15:19,587
- What are you talking about?
- Labour was induced.

152
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:24,759
In the mother's blood was a significant
trace of an herb called mandrake.

153
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:28,179
It's a poison that's been known
to facilitate self-abortion.

154
00:15:28,262 --> 00:15:29,305
Mandrake?

155
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:32,308
It's also been known
to be used as a hallucinogenic.

156
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:34,977
You think Mrs Weinsider self-prescribed?

157
00:15:35,061 --> 00:15:40,525
I called the doctor on a hunch and he said
that the father was very upset about the news

158
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:44,153
while the mother was quite the opposite.

159
00:15:44,237 --> 00:15:46,405
<i>I'm gonna fax this information to you</i>

160
00:15:46,531 --> 00:15:50,493
<i>so you can present it to the attorney
for the county of Roanoke.</i>

161
00:15:50,576 --> 00:15:54,122
<i>But I think we have
your baby-snatcher here. Mulder?</i>

162
00:15:54,914 --> 00:15:56,833
Yeah. What? Yes.

163
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,210
<i>I suggest that you proceed very carefully.</i>

164
00:15:59,293 --> 00:16:02,713
This could be very emotional
for everybody concerned.

165
00:16:02,797 --> 00:16:04,882
All right, thank you.

166
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:33,786
- What are you doing?
- Sorry, I forgot my key.

167
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:35,371
Where've you been?

168
00:16:35,454 --> 00:16:39,625
I told you I was gonna be on the road
until Tuesday... Poopydoo.

169
00:16:40,418 --> 00:16:43,212
I was just so worried, Wayne.

170
00:16:43,296 --> 00:16:45,423
We're getting so close now.

171
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:48,259
Honey...

172
00:16:48,342 --> 00:16:51,387
I wouldn't let anything happen.

173
00:16:51,470 --> 00:16:53,973
Not to our little bundle of joy.

174
00:16:59,812 --> 00:17:02,231
I'll tell you who's taken hallucinogenics.

175
00:17:02,315 --> 00:17:06,736
She didn't take any poison. My sister
never even heard of whatever the hell it is.

176
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:08,404
- Mandrake.
- Mandrake.

177
00:17:08,487 --> 00:17:12,033
- Where would she get such a thing?
- All I took were herbal sleep aids.

178
00:17:12,116 --> 00:17:16,746
- You don't need to say anything.
- Let your sister talk. It might clear things up.

179
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:19,165
- Not without a lawyer.
- She's not under arrest.

180
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:24,378
You're damn right she's not. I didn't call you
here to tell me rumours I've already heard.

181
00:17:24,462 --> 00:17:27,298
My sister's no baby killer!

182
00:17:30,676 --> 00:17:31,719
What's going on?

183
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:34,680
They're accusing me
of taking the life of our baby.

184
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:36,807
- Who's accusing you?
- Who do you think?

185
00:17:36,891 --> 00:17:41,312
I don't know where you've been, but I'm
the only one keeping the dogs from the door.

186
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:43,648
A man's gotta make a living.

187
00:17:43,731 --> 00:17:47,985
Mr Weinsider, I don't want to arrest Laura.

188
00:17:48,069 --> 00:17:52,531
I'm sure you'd hate like the devil
for that to happen as well.

189
00:17:54,325 --> 00:17:55,368
I should say so.

190
00:17:55,493 --> 00:17:58,537
Why not tell Deputy Stevens
it's OK to search the premises

191
00:17:58,663 --> 00:18:03,292
so we can clear up any misunderstanding
about who's responsible for what happened?

192
00:18:03,376 --> 00:18:05,503
Of course.

193
00:18:13,719 --> 00:18:16,514
Laura? Could you come here?

194
00:18:21,352 --> 00:18:25,564
Whatever else we find, I know
everybody in this house is regular.

195
00:18:34,365 --> 00:18:39,328
I know there's nothing they're going to find,
but why do I feel guilty anyway?

196
00:18:39,412 --> 00:18:43,332
Laura, there's something
I need to tell you about that.

197
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:47,712
Something I've kept secret for reasons
that I think will explain for themselves.

198
00:18:47,795 --> 00:18:50,298
What are you talking about?

199
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:53,592
I don't exactly know how to say this,

200
00:18:53,718 --> 00:18:56,929
but I'm sure that you might
find it painful, as I do.

201
00:18:57,054 --> 00:18:58,806
Wayne, what?

202
00:19:00,725 --> 00:19:02,810
On the night...

203
00:19:05,396 --> 00:19:08,649
the night that you lost the baby,

204
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:12,194
I had gotten up because I couldn't sleep.

205
00:19:12,278 --> 00:19:15,239
And when I came back to bed, you were...

206
00:19:18,117 --> 00:19:19,910
you had...

207
00:19:21,078 --> 00:19:23,748
our little baby in your hands.

208
00:19:23,831 --> 00:19:27,335
You were in some kind of trance.
I couldn't get you to wake up.

209
00:19:27,418 --> 00:19:34,175
You kept chanting over and over
"Zazas, zazas, nastanada, zazas..."

210
00:19:34,258 --> 00:19:35,468
Wayne...

211
00:19:35,593 --> 00:19:40,598
All I could do was take
our little boy, our little baby,

212
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:44,310
and wrap him up so I could make sure
no one could ever learn the truth.

213
00:19:44,435 --> 00:19:45,978
Oh, my God.

214
00:19:46,103 --> 00:19:47,980
And the other night...

215
00:19:50,191 --> 00:19:54,612
when you saw me outside...
and I was burning the leaves...

216
00:19:54,695 --> 00:19:57,907
No! No!

217
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:00,159
I was just doing it to protect you.

218
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:04,080
I knew that I could never
bring back our little boy,

219
00:20:04,163 --> 00:20:06,874
our precious little Wayne Junior.

220
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:09,668
But I couldn't bear losing you.

221
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:17,718
(man) Hey! Take a look at this!

222
00:20:31,232 --> 00:20:34,151
I don't know what to tell you.

223
00:20:35,319 --> 00:20:41,158
All I could think, when they told me
that something was wrong,

224
00:20:41,242 --> 00:20:44,578
that there was a problem,

225
00:20:44,662 --> 00:20:49,166
was that this thing that was
growing inside me was evil.

226
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:57,174
I kept thinking that maybe it was something
I did wrong and that this was my punishment.

227
00:20:59,218 --> 00:21:02,721
I told Wayne that
everything was gonna be OK.

228
00:21:06,058 --> 00:21:08,644
But I lied.

229
00:21:08,727 --> 00:21:12,690
But you have to believe me, Arky.
I didn't mean to kill him.

230
00:21:15,401 --> 00:21:18,362
I didn't know what I was doing.

231
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:21,699
It was the herbal medication.

232
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:25,369
- That's all I can think...
- Laura, Laura.

233
00:21:26,704 --> 00:21:28,956
I don't think you should say any more.

234
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,462
I'm gonna have to read you your rights.

235
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:41,051
We're gonna have to go down
to the station and do all that.

236
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:43,637
I'm sorry.

237
00:21:59,487 --> 00:22:03,741
You're gonna be OK.
I'm gonna get the best attorney.

238
00:22:10,915 --> 00:22:13,417
I know what you are.

00:22:38,275 --> 00:22:41,403
- Wayne, where are you?
- I'm on my way.

246
00:22:41,487 --> 00:22:44,657
- You're late. I'm going without you.
- I wanna be there, honey.

247
00:22:44,782 --> 00:22:48,327
I don't want to be a husband
who isn't there every step of the way.

248
00:22:48,452 --> 00:22:52,206
You've already missed a lot of
steps already. It's just a sonogram.

249
00:22:52,289 --> 00:22:56,752
It's not just a sonogram. It's a picture
of the expression of our beautiful love.

250
00:22:56,835 --> 00:23:00,005
- What have you been smoking?
- I'm three blocks away.

<i>- OK, I'll wait for you.
- OK, five minutes.</i>

- What?

00:23:09,682 --> 00:23:12,560
- Who you talking to?
- Who are you talking to?

255
00:23:12,643 --> 00:23:15,396
- You seem like you're in an awful big hurry.
- Wayne?

256
00:23:15,479 --> 00:23:18,315
- I'm late for an appointment.
- Appointment with who?

257
00:23:18,399 --> 00:23:21,527
- A business client.
- Wayne, I'm hanging up now.

258
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:25,489
You're in insurance.
That must take you out on the road a lot.

259
00:23:25,573 --> 00:23:28,784
I'm an insurance medical technician.

260
00:23:28,867 --> 00:23:32,413
So where is our appointment?
How far do we have to go?

261
00:23:32,496 --> 00:23:34,832

- Come on, I'll race ya.

Oh, hi, Mrs Britton.
Wayne Weinsider. Remember me?

264
00:23:54,018 --> 00:23:57,313
Harmony Mutual Insurance? You had
an appointment to have blood taken.

265
00:23:57,396 --> 00:23:59,732
It's for next Tuesday.

266
00:23:59,857 --> 00:24:02,401
I know that, Kim. Can I call you Kim?

267
00:24:02,526 --> 00:24:04,612
I was in the neighbourhood and...

268
00:24:04,695 --> 00:24:08,866
insurance isn't something you wanna
be without, even for just a week.

269
00:24:23,797 --> 00:24:25,382
What do you do with that?

270
00:24:25,466 --> 00:24:29,136
They check it, make sure
you're not a policy risk.

271
00:24:30,304 --> 00:24:32,765
Slow down, monsters.

272
00:24:36,644 --> 00:24:39,021
- Those your kids?
- Why, yes.

273
00:24:39,104 --> 00:24:42,733
I love kids. Got a baby on the way myself.

274
00:24:43,651 --> 00:24:46,153
Seems like I've been trying for ever.

275

<i>(softly) Hold that up.</i>

You don't know how lucky you are.

278
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:05,172
Two cells, with all that can go wrong,
and there they are. Perfect.

- No, I'm OK.

00:25:51,385 --> 00:25:52,344
Yeah.

- <i>(Scully) You're busted.</i>
- What?

287
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:57,057
I just got an earful from
Assistant Director Kersh.

288
00:25:57,141 --> 00:26:02,396
<i>He got a call from Mr Weinsider,
who says that you're harassing him.</i>

289
00:26:02,479 --> 00:26:04,189
Leave me alone.

290
00:26:07,735 --> 00:26:11,363
Mulder, I have to tell him something.
What do you want me to say?

291
00:26:11,488 --> 00:26:15,159
Tell him I'm down here doing
a background check on somebody.

292
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:43,353
I got a message you needed to see me,
Laura. What is it?

293
00:26:44,396 --> 00:26:45,856
I'm afraid.

294
00:26:47,191 --> 00:26:52,446
I've been meeting with attorneys and, given
the circumstances and your emotional state,

295
00:26:52,529 --> 00:26:56,283
they feel confident of an acquittal,
if that's what you're worried about.

296
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:59,703
No, Wayne. I've been thinking.

297
00:27:00,037 --> 00:27:03,332
Thinking? About what?

298
00:27:03,415 --> 00:27:05,250
About your story.

299
00:27:07,628 --> 00:27:10,005
About how it doesn't make sense.

300
00:27:10,088 --> 00:27:13,634
You said you wrapped
the baby up to hide it,

301
00:27:13,717 --> 00:27:15,803
but what they found in the fire

302
00:27:15,886 --> 00:27:20,641
was wrapped in the nightgown I had on
when I woke up from my nightmare.

303
00:27:21,767 --> 00:27:25,270
But that's not possible, Laura.
You must be mistaken.

304
00:27:27,105 --> 00:27:29,525
And I keep thinking about

305
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:35,197
the face of that terrible creature
at the end of the bed,

306
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:40,285
and I remember something
that I didn't tell anybody.

307
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:44,414
Not even you.

308
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:46,875
Laura, you're scaring me.

309
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:50,879
No matter what you believe,
I only have one desire: to protect you,

310
00:27:50,963 --> 00:27:53,757
to put this all behind us.

311
00:28:04,643 --> 00:28:07,145
Why'd you go and do that, Laura?

312
00:28:08,772 --> 00:28:11,483
You've got to know that I love you.

313
00:28:13,151 --> 00:28:17,531
And I just wish... you could've been the one.

I need a neurologist consult down at the ER.

Bring it back home?

334
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:24,992
- Is there a problem?
- The doctor found something.

335
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:30,455
She doesn't know yet, but there's some kind
of bony growth on the baby's spine and skull.

336
00:30:30,580 --> 00:30:35,419
It may just be a stage of development.
She really just wants to wait and see.

337
00:30:51,268 --> 00:30:53,812
OK. Sure.

338
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:05,615
Whatever happens, you know
I love you. No matter what.

339
00:31:06,283 --> 00:31:10,662
Do you, Wayne? Cos sometimes
I wonder what goes on inside your head.

340
00:31:11,621 --> 00:31:14,249
Nothing but good thoughts.

341
00:31:14,332 --> 00:31:17,210
You and this baby are my hopes and dreams.

342
00:31:18,837 --> 00:31:20,964
Mine too.

343
00:31:22,841 --> 00:31:26,678
Why don't I get you a warm glass of milk
and we'll go to bed?

344
00:31:26,803 --> 00:31:28,055
OK.

345
00:31:40,317 --> 00:31:43,195
You asked me to come here,
then you're nowhere to be found.

346
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:46,364
I was at County Records,
doing a background check.

347
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:51,995
Mulder... it's me.
That's your cover story, remember?

348
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:55,415
I was piecing together the history
of the man who did this to her.

349
00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:59,961
That's why I was looking for you,
because in fact nobody did anything to her.

350
00:32:00,045 --> 00:32:03,882
There's absolutely no evidence of
bodily injury, overdose, suffocation,

351
00:32:04,007 --> 00:32:07,177
of anything that would explain
why she was in a coma.

352
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:10,806
- Perfect.
- I don't think you heard what I said.

353
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:13,809
I did a complete medical review,
just as you asked.

354
00:32:13,892 --> 00:32:18,563
What I'm saying is there is not a shred of
evidence to implicate the husband or anyone.

355
00:32:18,688 --> 00:32:24,194
Not a shred of evidence is exactly the
evidence I hoped you'd find. Check this out.

356
00:32:27,697 --> 00:32:31,952
"Ivan Veles, born Czechoslovakia, 1956."

357
00:32:32,035 --> 00:32:36,623
"Married twice, widowed twice, no children.
Prosecuted twice for murder of wives."

358
00:32:36,706 --> 00:32:39,668
"Acquitted twice on lack of evidence."
Who is Ivan Veles?

359
00:32:39,751 --> 00:32:44,631
Wayne Weinsider.
Czech national, emigrated 1994.

360
00:32:44,714 --> 00:32:48,844
He's also known as Bud Hasselhoff.
Also known as Gordy Boytano.

361
00:32:48,927 --> 00:32:51,763
- Gordy Boytano?
- There's more. Read on.

362
00:32:52,264 --> 00:32:56,768
"In Slavic societies, the name Veles
was synonymous with...

363
00:32:56,893 --> 00:32:59,146
the devil."

364
00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:04,901
"From the Lithuanian root "vele", a horned
demon who sucks the souls of the innocent."

365
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:10,532
Mulder, you're not suggesting
that he is himself a devil, are you?

366
00:33:10,615 --> 00:33:14,244
I'm not suggesting anything.
I think the facts speak for themselves.

367
00:33:14,327 --> 00:33:19,166
I will accept that a man can be demonic,
that he may have demon-like attributes.

368
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:22,252
But why would a demon,
if there were such a thing,

369
00:33:22,335 --> 00:33:26,882
bother with a Make-Room-For-Daddy routine
just so he can off his wife and unborn child?

370
00:33:26,965 --> 00:33:29,342
I don't know why. I'm not a psychologist,

371
00:33:29,426 --> 00:33:33,430
but this is the best explanation
for "how" that I've heard.

372
00:34:10,675 --> 00:34:13,637
This'll put you to sleep on a cloud...

373
00:34:14,804 --> 00:34:17,349
where troubles melt away.

374
00:34:17,474 --> 00:34:18,683
Ah.

375
00:34:18,808 --> 00:34:21,478
Sometimes I remember
why I married you.

376
00:34:45,210 --> 00:34:47,837
(man) It's pretty hard.

377
00:34:47,921 --> 00:34:50,006
Get me the pick.

378
00:34:53,843 --> 00:34:56,680
We've got technology out here.

379
00:34:56,763 --> 00:35:00,934
Subterranean mapping equipment from
Richmond PD. Still can't find a damn thing.

380
00:35:01,017 --> 00:35:03,103
(man) Over here!

381
00:35:08,525 --> 00:35:11,027
Daniel, bring that light over here.

382
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:17,367
You'll find discrete osteopathic
deformities to the upper vertebrae.

383
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:22,956
Two bony protrusions between
the parietal and occipital lobes of the skull.

384
00:35:29,963 --> 00:35:33,383
- Good Lord.
- Put out an APB for your brother-in-law.

385
00:35:33,466 --> 00:35:35,593
- What are you talking...
- Just find him.

386
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:37,345
What are you talking about?

387
00:35:37,429 --> 00:35:40,807
He's done this to other women here,
just like in Czechoslovakia.

388
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:44,853
My guess is that baby we dug up
belonged to one of Wayne's other wives.

389
00:35:44,936 --> 00:35:47,605
You're saying
he's trying to profligate, to breed?

390
00:35:47,731 --> 00:35:52,777
He's exercising his biological imperative.
He'll do or say anything he has to to succeed.

391
00:35:52,902 --> 00:35:54,988
It makes no sense. If he wants to breed,

392
00:35:55,071 --> 00:35:58,616
why would he snatch his own babies
and bury them in his back yard?

393
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:02,662
Because they're demons,
and he wants a normal child.

394
00:36:21,931 --> 00:36:23,308
No! No!

395
00:36:23,433 --> 00:36:25,101
Wayne! Wayne!

396
00:36:26,144 --> 00:36:27,937
What are you doing?

397
00:36:29,272 --> 00:36:34,361
Maybe you didn't hear me.
I said, what are you doing, Wayne?

398
00:36:43,036 --> 00:36:46,539
1-5-5-2-7 Leahy.

399
00:36:47,624 --> 00:36:52,379
That's in Cave Spring.
That's West Roanoke. Cave Spring.

400
00:36:52,462 --> 00:36:55,340
Thank you. Thank you
very much for your help.

401
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:58,968
Scully, hold on.

402
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,812
Where are we going?

403
00:37:08,895 --> 00:37:12,857
Harmony Mutual Insurance has
a second address for Wayne Weinsider,

404
00:37:12,982 --> 00:37:15,985
all the way across the other side
of Roanoke County.

405
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:18,822
- You think he's got a second wife?
- Think about it.

406
00:37:18,905 --> 00:37:21,658
He meets or screens
prospective women through work.

407
00:37:21,741 --> 00:37:25,870
That's probably why he came to this country:
bigger gene pool, more women.

408
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:28,540
And he plants as many seeds as he can.

409
00:37:29,666 --> 00:37:34,045
Let's just hope he hasn't been
able to harvest many more of them.

410
00:37:38,591 --> 00:37:39,926
Mulder...

411
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:42,053
<i>(car horn honks)</i>

412
00:37:42,178 --> 00:37:43,430

Please.

416
00:38:00,029 --> 00:38:03,533
He took my baby! He took my baby!

417
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:08,204
- It's OK.
- Wayne. Wayne!

418
00:38:08,288 --> 00:38:11,207
Wayne. He took my baby.

419
00:38:40,111 --> 00:38:41,196
<i>(boy on TV) Mom?</i>

420
00:38:41,279 --> 00:38:44,741
<i>(man on TV) Come on,

<i>- (man) How are you?
- (girl) Is he going to die?</i>

424
00:38:57,420 --> 00:39:00,256
<i>(man) Of course not.
People don't die from chickenpox.</i>

425
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:03,468
<i>- (woman) Have you had chickenpox?
- (man) Yes. How about you?</i>

426
00:39:03,593 --> 00:39:07,013
- <i>(woman) I've been trying to remember.</i>
- <i>You'll know in</i> a <i>day or two.</i>

427
00:39:07,096 --> 00:39:11,100
<i>(woman) That's what's worrying me.
I'll be down in a minute.</i>

428
00:39:11,184 --> 00:39:14,270
<i>- (girl) I think she's going to die.
- (man) Don't talk like that.</i>

429
00:39:23,446 --> 00:39:25,532
<i>(Mulder) Wayne.</i>

430
00:39:27,116 --> 00:39:29,202
It's over.

431
00:39:29,994 --> 00:39:34,999
A normal life, a family.
That's all I ever wanted.

432
00:39:35,124 --> 00:39:37,627
Where's the baby, Wayne?

433
00:39:39,712 --> 00:39:42,632
How could she do this to them?

434
00:39:42,715 --> 00:39:46,427
Put the shovel down.
Your lies won't work any more.

435
00:39:46,511 --> 00:39:49,722
My lies? What about her lies?

436
00:39:49,806 --> 00:39:53,977
Whatever the truth, Mr Weinsider,
you can't hope to bury it now.

437
00:39:55,895 --> 00:40:00,483
I'm not burying anything. I'm digging it up.

438
00:40:01,067 --> 00:40:03,152
Where's the baby?

439
00:40:04,487 --> 00:40:08,157
Don't you understand?
She took it. Betsy took it!

440
00:40:08,241 --> 00:40:11,995
You can't blame anyone else,
like you did with Laura.

441
00:40:13,496 --> 00:40:16,124
Don't you see?

442
00:40:16,207 --> 00:40:18,418
Betsy isn't like Laura.

443
00:40:19,377 --> 00:40:20,670
Betsy is...

444
00:40:29,262 --> 00:40:31,347
<i>(Scully) Get the paramedics.</i>

445
00:40:38,563 --> 00:40:41,190
I just wanted what everyone wants.

446
00:40:56,581 --> 00:41:01,544
Don't even think about it. Put him someplace
else. I don't want him in sight of my sister.

447
00:41:01,628 --> 00:41:04,047
- He just got out of surgery.
- Give me this.

448
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:06,841
Cut it out. You're in enough trouble as it is.

449
00:41:06,924 --> 00:41:11,596
You don't wanna complicate your situation
by endangering his life again, do you?

450
00:41:11,721 --> 00:41:15,308
That son of a bitch better live,
so I can beat the truth out of him.

451
00:41:15,391 --> 00:41:18,645
Find out why he did it
and how the hell he did it.

452
00:41:18,728 --> 00:41:22,315
I think the "why"
is directly related to the "how".

453
00:41:22,398 --> 00:41:25,443
What do you mean?
What do you mean by that?

454
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:29,656
We should go talk to his other wife, Betsy.

455
00:41:29,739 --> 00:41:31,824
I don't know.

456
00:41:35,244 --> 00:41:37,497
<i>(regular beeping)</i>

457
00:42:00,478 --> 00:42:02,855
<i>(beeping gets faster)</i>

458
00:42:29,716 --> 00:42:31,384

459
00:42:31,467 --> 00:42:33,886
Page Dr Nyland up here!

460
00:42:33,970 --> 00:42:38,641
Just breathe deep, Mrs Weinsider.
Can you breathe for me?

461
00:42:57,201 --> 00:42:59,328
<i>( Mulder) How</i> many?

462
00:43:00,413 --> 00:43:04,167
Four, total. All here for some time.

463
00:43:05,334 --> 00:43:08,921
Maybe years. All normal, though, Mulder.

464
00:43:09,005 --> 00:43:12,091
No osteological deformities.

465
00:43:12,175 --> 00:43:17,305
And Betsy's baby isn't here.
There are no fresh graves.

466
00:43:17,388 --> 00:43:18,848
I know.

467
00:43:20,266 --> 00:43:23,561
- What did he do with it?
- I don't think he did anything with it.

468
00:43:23,686 --> 00:43:28,441
But she was recently pregnant. I saw
her records, her sonograms, in the house.

469
00:43:28,524 --> 00:43:32,445
Showing the same defects.
These weren't Wayne's babies, Scully.

470
00:43:33,696 --> 00:43:35,448
Whose babies were they?

471
00:43:35,531 --> 00:43:38,826
I think Wayne realised something last night.

472
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:43,080
He realised that he'd met someone
even more evil than he was,

473
00:43:43,206 --> 00:43:47,460
who would sacrifice what
he desperately wanted for himself.

474
00:43:47,543 --> 00:43:48,503
Betsy?

475
00:43:48,586 --> 00:43:53,674
It was no coincidence that she ran into us.
We were taken in by herjust like Wayne was.

476
00:43:53,758 --> 00:43:56,469
She would say or do anything
to get what she wanted,

477
00:43:56,552 --> 00:43:59,680
and was even more driven than he was.

478
00:43:59,764 --> 00:44:03,142
- Driven to what?
- To have what only Wayne could give her.
