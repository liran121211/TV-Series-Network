<i>And tread once more familiar paths.</i>

00:00:19,479 --> 00:00:23,525
<i>Perchance I perished
in an arrogant self-reliance an age ago;</i>

5
00:00:24,276 --> 00:00:28,197
<i>And in that act, a prayer
for one more chance went up so earnest,</i>

6

<i>So instinct with better light let in by death,</i>

00:00:33,911 --> 00:00:37,080
<i>That life was blotted out, not so completely</i>

to remain dim memories,</i>

...also known as Vernon Ephesian.

22
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:26,523
He's somewhere on the compound.

23

- <i>(Scully)</i> Ephesian?
- No. We've covered 90% of the compound.

- <i>(Scully)</i> We have to find him.
- No sign of weapons.

25

- They've hid them somewhere.
- Where haven't we covered?

26
00:02:37,451 --> 00:02:41,538
We could check the machine shop again.
Maybe they've got trap doors.

00:02:47,836 --> 00:02:50,255
Mulder. Mulder!

28

<i>(dialling tone)</i>

57
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:11,271
This call capped off a BATF investigation...

58
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:14,608
...of the Temple of the Seven Stars
led by Vernon Ephesian.

59
00:05:14,691 --> 00:05:18,278
That call convinced the Attorney General
to give the OK for our raid.

60
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:20,447
ATF intelligence reports were weak.

61
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,993
Our man, Spooky, found Ephesian
in a bunker ATF didn't even know was there.

62
00:05:25,076 --> 00:05:27,662
<i>- How did you know that?
- (men arguing)</i>

63
00:05:27,746 --> 00:05:28,914
Knock it off!

64
00:05:30,582 --> 00:05:34,419
The reports are valid. Illegal activities
<i>were</i> going on at that compound.

65
00:05:34,503 --> 00:05:36,838
They were alerted in time
to hide the evidence.

66
00:05:36,922 --> 00:05:41,551
Ephesian and his wives are held on charges
of possession of dangerous chemicals.

67
00:05:41,635 --> 00:05:44,596
Their attorneys will be
pushing for a quick arraignment.

68
00:05:44,846 --> 00:05:49,059
They'll be out of here in less than 24 hours
if we cannot charge them.

69
00:05:51,019 --> 00:05:54,689
Agents on site will continue to search
for evidence of illegal firearms.

70
00:05:54,814 --> 00:05:58,151
And even more critical,
find the informant "Sidney".

71
00:05:58,568 --> 00:06:03,865
If they found out that he tipped us,
it's likely we're looking for a murderer.

72
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:06,576
All right, go.

73
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:13,875
Agent Mulder, Agent Scully...

74
00:06:15,544 --> 00:06:20,173
...you were assigned to this operation to
investigate Ephesian's paranormal abilities:

75
00:06:20,257 --> 00:06:21,841
...channelling, astral projection.

76
00:06:21,925 --> 00:06:27,430
He's a paranoid charismatic sociopath,
obsessed with the Book of Revelation.

77
00:06:27,514 --> 00:06:31,434
He will use his Biblical knowledge to get
anything he wants from his followers.

78
00:06:31,518 --> 00:06:35,772
Ephesian had six women on the verge
of suicide. You witnessed it.

79
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:38,483
If the temple members are released...

80
00:06:38,567 --> 00:06:41,987
...any Federal investigation
will ignite Ephesian's paranoia...

81
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:45,907
...to such a degree that we won't have
another Waco on our hands.

82
00:06:46,324 --> 00:06:48,201
We'll have Jonestown.

83
00:06:51,955 --> 00:06:53,957
I knew you were coming.

84
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:57,919
I've known for nine centuries.

85
00:06:59,462 --> 00:07:02,132
It was written
in the Revelation of Jesus Christ.

86
00:07:03,675 --> 00:07:04,884
"Behold, ...

87
00:07:06,344 --> 00:07:10,515
...the devil shall cast some of thee
into prison that you may be tried."

88
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:14,019
"You'll have tribulation ten days."

89
00:07:14,102 --> 00:07:18,773
"Be thou faithful unto death,
and I'll give thee a crown of life."

90
00:07:18,857 --> 00:07:21,401
But that message
was to the church at Smyrna.

91
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:25,447
Your temple is the reincarnation
of the church at Ephesia.

92
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:28,575
Mine is the Temple of the Seven Stars.

93
00:07:29,784 --> 00:07:32,829
All seven churches receiving the Revelation.

94
00:07:35,582 --> 00:07:40,420
And the members are not
a reincarnation of the church.

95
00:07:41,379 --> 00:07:42,464
Are you?

96
00:07:42,547 --> 00:07:45,592
Oh, yes. I was present
to hear Apostle John Mark

97
00:07:45,675 --> 00:07:47,636
deliver his message of the Apocalypse.

98
00:07:47,719 --> 00:07:52,432
Vernon, if Sidney was unfaithful,
did he receive a crown of life?

99
00:07:52,515 --> 00:07:55,518
There are no members of the Temple
named Sidney.

100
00:07:55,852 --> 00:07:57,812
But I know you don't believe.

101
00:07:58,313 --> 00:08:02,901
I don't care if you think that
I'm Jim Jones or David Koresh.

102
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:06,488
I don't need you to believe or even like me.

103
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:10,909
But just for a moment, I'd like you
to put aside your investigation...

104
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:13,745
...for your own souls.

105
00:08:15,413 --> 00:08:19,334
It is vital that you understand
that very, very soon...

106
00:08:19,834 --> 00:08:23,338
...all unfaithfuls, all disbelievers, all beasts -

107
00:08:23,838 --> 00:08:25,882
...if that means me or...

108
00:08:26,174 --> 00:08:27,967
...this "Sidney"... or...

109
00:08:29,135 --> 00:08:30,428
--YOu _

110
00:08:31,513 --> 00:08:34,516
...all will be destroyed by God's mighty men.

111
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:37,894
It is what has been told by God will happen.

112
00:08:39,521 --> 00:08:42,357
It is what has been told by God we must do.

113
00:08:43,775 --> 00:08:47,779
Do this, and the Lord
shall preserve you from all evil.

114
00:08:49,572 --> 00:08:51,324
He will preserve your soul.

115
00:08:52,492 --> 00:08:55,078
The Lord will preserve your going out...

116
00:08:56,913 --> 00:08:58,415
...and your coming in.

117
00:09:00,917 --> 00:09:04,170
<i>(Scully)</i> Skinner said no one else
has come up with anything.

118
00:09:04,254 --> 00:09:07,048
They've started to release
members of the Temple.

119
00:09:07,132 --> 00:09:10,427
The compound
remains under Federal control, though.

120
00:09:12,137 --> 00:09:15,140
Time is flying.
We've got six wives to question.

121
00:09:15,557 --> 00:09:20,562
My estimate is 12 more hours of fire and
brimstone, and not a second about Sidney.

122
00:09:20,854 --> 00:09:22,147
Let's start with her.

123
00:09:28,111 --> 00:09:30,905
My name is Melissa Riedel Ephesian. I'm 25.

124
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:34,743
Melissa, do you understand
your right to have an attorney

125
00:09:34,826 --> 00:09:36,870
present at this questioning?

126
00:09:38,204 --> 00:09:39,497
It's OK.

127
00:09:39,748 --> 00:09:41,458
Where are you from?

128
00:09:46,296 --> 00:09:47,464
I don't know.

129
00:09:47,714 --> 00:09:50,967
What about your family?
Where do they live?

130
00:09:51,301 --> 00:09:52,802
My real family's here.

131
00:09:52,886 --> 00:09:54,721
How long have you lived there?

132
00:09:56,931 --> 00:09:58,141
A year.

133
00:09:58,892 --> 00:10:01,561
How long have you been married
to Ephesian?

134
00:10:02,854 --> 00:10:04,189
A year.

135
00:10:04,606 --> 00:10:06,649
Does it bother you he has other wives?

136
00:10:06,733 --> 00:10:10,695
"And on that day, seven women
shall take hold of one man, saying...

137
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:14,824
...we shall eat our own bread,
we shall wear our own apparel...

138
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:19,913
...only let us be called by thy name
to take away our reproach."

139
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:22,916
That's quite a faith you have in Vernon.

140
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:27,545
I'd have a tough time if my husband
had so many children with other women.

141
00:10:29,714 --> 00:10:32,133
Do you have a child by Vernon?

142
00:10:33,927 --> 00:10:35,428
Someday.

143
00:10:37,889 --> 00:10:43,520
Vernon has to wait until God tells him when
the right soul is ready to be reincarnated.

144
00:10:43,603 --> 00:10:48,107
That's why Vernon's children are
the most sacred members of the Temple.

145
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:51,569
We were told
that Vernon's been hurting the children.

146
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:58,368
Have you ever witnessed any child abuse
at the temple, Melissa?

147
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:08,670
(man's voice) I don't know
where you're gettin' that from.

148
00:11:08,753 --> 00:11:12,757
I saw a coupla things.
It could have been anything, right?

149
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:14,425
Melissa?

150
00:11:14,509 --> 00:11:17,428
Melissa?
No. I don't know nobody called that.

151
00:11:17,512 --> 00:11:21,683
- Sidney?
- What is this? The McCarthy hearings?

152
00:11:21,766 --> 00:11:23,309
No, no... Don't...

153
00:11:24,352 --> 00:11:26,437
Don't know anybody by that name. No.

154
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:30,108
I saw a coupla things.
It could have been anything, right?

155
00:11:30,233 --> 00:11:34,028
Sidney, who is the President
of the United States right now?

156
00:11:34,112 --> 00:11:36,990
Who's the President of the United States?

157
00:11:37,073 --> 00:11:41,744
What kind of dumb question is that?
That is a stupid question. Harry Truman.

158
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:50,128
Sidney is a past life
just because she mentioned Joe McCarthy?

159
00:11:50,211 --> 00:11:51,713
It's not just that.

160
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,340
Somehow I just knew.

161
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:14,694
<i>(door opens)</i>

162
00:12:14,777 --> 00:12:17,113
Ephesian and his wives
get arraigned tomorrow.

163
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:19,741
That's 15 hours to come up with something.

164
00:12:19,824 --> 00:12:22,744
"Come up with something"?
We found Sidney.

165
00:12:22,827 --> 00:12:26,331
Melissa Riedel's vocal pattern
matches the ATF Sidney call.

166
00:12:26,414 --> 00:12:28,207
Melissa Riedel is not co-operating.

167
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:31,419
But there is a personality within her
that wants to.

168
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:34,797
We need a catalyst. I suggest
we take her back to the compound.

169
00:12:34,881 --> 00:12:39,052
Maybe without Ephesian there,
it will enable Melissa to talk,

170
00:12:39,135 --> 00:12:41,220
or a personality inside her.

171
00:12:42,931 --> 00:12:45,683
Agent Scully,
could this be a staged diversion?

172
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:49,771
- I thought multiple personalities were rare.
- They're extremely rare.

173
00:12:49,854 --> 00:12:54,359
In fact, many in the psychiatric community
do not believe they exist.

174
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:57,820
What we witnessed meets the criteria
established in the DSM-IV.

175
00:12:57,904 --> 00:13:00,365
Two or more distinct personality states

176
00:13:00,448 --> 00:13:02,200
that recurrently take control
over behaviour...

177
00:13:02,283 --> 00:13:04,619
...including the protector identity, Sidney.

178
00:13:04,702 --> 00:13:08,790
The inability to recall personal information.
She couldn't recall her home town.

179
00:13:08,873 --> 00:13:12,001
Transitions are usually a matter of seconds

180
00:13:12,085 --> 00:13:14,087
and are often caused
by psychosocial stress.

181
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:17,632
Sidney appeared when we mentioned
that children had been abused.

182
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:21,219
- But you remain unconvinced?
- I believe the disorder exists...

183
00:13:21,302 --> 00:13:23,846
...but I would have to know more.

184
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:29,602
If Melissa has multiple personalities, would
her... his testimony even be admissible?

185
00:13:29,686 --> 00:13:33,439
Precedents have established that
dissociative personalities are responsible.

186
00:13:33,523 --> 00:13:35,817
But <i>we</i> are responsible for Melissa Riedel.

187
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:39,654
We are responsible for
the potential loss of 50 lives.

188
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,242
Do it.

189
00:13:46,953 --> 00:13:49,914
You didn't tell Skinner
what you really believe.

190
00:13:49,998 --> 00:13:54,002
That Melissa Riedel is being invaded
by her past-life incarnations.

191
00:13:54,085 --> 00:13:58,756
- He wouldn't believe me.
- You don't feel responsible for the 50 lives...

192
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,717
...or Melissa Riedel.

193
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:04,303
You are only responsible
to yourself, Mulder.

194
00:14:10,685 --> 00:14:13,229
(Mulder) You're safe with us, Melissa.

195
00:14:14,022 --> 00:14:15,732
The murderer's not here.

196
00:14:15,815 --> 00:14:19,485
(Scully) We know that events occurred here
that may be painful.

197
00:14:20,278 --> 00:14:24,907
You may not wanna talk about them,
you may be afraid to remember.

198
00:14:27,035 --> 00:14:32,707
But to help the others,
to help the children and to help yourself...

199
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:37,754
...we're here with you to listen...
to Melissa, to Sidney...

200
00:14:37,837 --> 00:14:40,173
...to whoever may need to talk.

201
00:16:04,924 --> 00:16:06,300
Melissa?

202
00:16:11,764 --> 00:16:13,099
Melissa?

203
00:16:13,641 --> 00:16:15,518
Why you calling me that?

204
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:18,688
- What should I call you?
- Lily.

205
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:25,111
Lily... were any of your friends
hurt in this room?

206
00:16:32,076 --> 00:16:33,244
What?

207
00:16:33,995 --> 00:16:35,663
Can you do this?

208
00:16:35,872 --> 00:16:37,790
Melissa... Lily...

209
00:16:40,334 --> 00:16:42,295
It's OK to tell me.

210
00:16:49,886 --> 00:16:52,889
(Sidney) Look, leave the kid alone. Hear me?

211
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:56,142
She doesn't wanna talk. Right? No way.

212
00:16:56,225 --> 00:16:57,435
I'm sending her home.

213
00:16:57,518 --> 00:17:00,855
Sidney, you can all go home.
You can all be safe...

214
00:17:00,938 --> 00:17:03,524
...if you tell us where they hid the guns.

215
00:18:04,293 --> 00:18:06,295
What's wrong?

216
00:18:30,403 --> 00:18:34,949
(Southern accent) The weapons were placed
in the bunker they'd built the night before.

217
00:18:35,032 --> 00:18:37,493
That's why they weren't on the ATF reports.

218
00:18:37,576 --> 00:18:41,872
The Federals would arrive in the morning,
just before the sun.

219
00:18:42,748 --> 00:18:46,043
Realising the government's
might and number...

220
00:18:46,127 --> 00:18:49,213
...most believed they, indeed,
would never again...

221
00:18:49,297 --> 00:18:51,424
...see the light of day...

222
00:18:51,507 --> 00:18:56,429
...just as they had watched their brothers die
days before on Missionary Ridge.

223
00:18:56,512 --> 00:19:00,391
We had received word of General Cleburne's
retreat from the Union army.

224
00:19:00,474 --> 00:19:05,438
As a nurse, I had been ordered from
Hamilton County to meet the troops, but...

225
00:19:06,772 --> 00:19:09,692
...in actuality, I was searching for him...

226
00:19:10,276 --> 00:19:13,279
...knowing that he would attempt
to remain in Tennessee...

227
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:15,698
...rather than retreat to Dalton.

228
00:19:16,741 --> 00:19:19,201
I found him here...

229
00:19:19,285 --> 00:19:21,912
...amongst the others who had been lost...

230
00:19:21,996 --> 00:19:25,499
...as General Thomas pushed through
the Confederate line.

231
00:19:29,962 --> 00:19:33,257
The Federal troops would appear
from that direction.

232
00:19:33,841 --> 00:19:37,553
Rather than retreat any further,
they fought them...

233
00:19:37,887 --> 00:19:40,014
...hidin' us in the bunker.

234
00:19:41,474 --> 00:19:43,309
Inside, I could...

235
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:44,977
...smell the smoke...

236
00:19:45,895 --> 00:19:47,897
...hear the rifles...

237
00:19:49,398 --> 00:19:53,110
...feel the bodies as they dropped
onto the ground above.

238
00:19:56,906 --> 00:19:59,158
Every last one.

239
00:20:03,162 --> 00:20:04,872
26th November...

240
00:20:06,374 --> 00:20:08,376
...1863.

241
00:20:16,884 --> 00:20:18,636
I was here...

242
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:22,473
...as were you.

243
00:20:31,857 --> 00:20:34,485
This is the field where I watched you die.

244
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:55,673
<i>(Scully) Who are you calling?</i>

245
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:59,093
I want a therapist trained in hypnosis
to be at the command centre.

246
00:20:59,176 --> 00:21:02,346
Because hypnosis is used
to treat dissociative identities...

247
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:05,683
...to bring forth a patient's
various personalities?

248
00:21:05,808 --> 00:21:08,936
She wants to talk, Scully.
It's a matter of getting it out of her.

249
00:21:09,019 --> 00:21:11,856
No, it's about regressing her to a past life.

250
00:21:11,981 --> 00:21:16,861
Don't do this to her, Mulder. This poor
woman's mind, her life is in shreds.

251
00:21:17,528 --> 00:21:21,699
Just being married to Ephesian indicates
she is susceptible to suggestion.

252
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:23,868
You were there, Scully!

253
00:21:24,452 --> 00:21:28,164
You saw it. You heard it.
Why can't you feel it?

254
00:21:29,874 --> 00:21:32,710
How could I know about a bunker
in a field I've never been in?

255
00:21:32,793 --> 00:21:37,047
And why is it that Vernon Ephesian is
reported by you a paranoid sociopath...

256
00:21:37,131 --> 00:21:39,633
...because he believes
he lived 100 years ago...

257
00:21:39,717 --> 00:21:43,971
...and you're not, even though you believe
you died in that field?

258
00:21:49,894 --> 00:21:52,229
<i>(therapist)</i> I'm talking to Melissa.

259
00:21:53,022 --> 00:21:55,816
In the last year,
at the Temple of the Seven Stars...

260
00:21:55,900 --> 00:22:00,529
...is there anything that happened that
you thought was wrong, that hurt you?

261
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:02,031
Yes.

262
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,372
There was a...

263
00:22:13,209 --> 00:22:15,503
...woman who came to the temple.

264
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:20,758
She and her son
had been living on the streets.

265
00:22:20,925 --> 00:22:22,259
What was her name?

266
00:22:23,052 --> 00:22:24,386
Elizabeth.

267
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:26,931
Her son was Scott.

268
00:22:28,599 --> 00:22:30,935
Vernon took a liking to the boy.

269
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,938
He said that he was a prophet returning.

270
00:22:36,524 --> 00:22:38,943
He took the boy away from his mother.

271
00:22:39,193 --> 00:22:41,195
Took him away? How?

272
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:47,284
Vernon's children are the grandchildren
of God, kept separate from the others.

273
00:22:48,911 --> 00:22:50,955
The mother's heart was broken.

274
00:22:51,455 --> 00:22:52,957
She was afraid.

275
00:22:53,874 --> 00:22:55,459
The Mighty Men...

276
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:00,381
Late... night...

277
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,635
...Liz sneaks in to see Scott.

278
00:23:05,386 --> 00:23:06,929
Oh, he was happy-

279
00:23:08,305 --> 00:23:11,976
She brings him a butterfinger
she stole from the kitchen.

280
00:23:15,563 --> 00:23:17,731
Vernon... Vernon...

281
00:23:17,815 --> 00:23:19,650
...Vernon catches them.

282
00:23:21,819 --> 00:23:23,612
The Mighty Men...

283
00:23:24,947 --> 00:23:28,075
...they pull her away, and beat her...

284
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:30,744
...in front of her son.

285
00:23:30,828 --> 00:23:33,247
The boy... "No, no, Mom!"

286
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:34,665
<i>(crying)</i>

287
00:23:37,793 --> 00:23:39,587
Vernon... Vernon...

288
00:23:40,170 --> 00:23:41,839
...Vernon pulls him by...

289
00:23:42,339 --> 00:23:45,009
...Vernon pulls him by his hair...

290
00:23:46,677 --> 00:23:49,847
...pulls down his pyjamas, and hit him.

291
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:54,602
"You're not a child of God."

292
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:57,938
"Garbage", he calls him.

293
00:23:58,814 --> 00:24:00,941
He told him to sleep in the trash...

294
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:02,985
...with the rats.

295
00:24:05,154 --> 00:24:08,032
The mother... the mother cries...

296
00:24:09,116 --> 00:24:11,702
...but Vernon beats him...

297
00:24:12,494 --> 00:24:13,537
...in front of her.

298
00:24:13,662 --> 00:24:16,540
<i>(whimpering) Oh! Oh! No, no, no!</i>

299
00:24:17,625 --> 00:24:21,003
(Sidney) Lookit!
Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant move!

300
00:24:21,503 --> 00:24:24,298
What d'you wanna know? Just... just...

301
00:24:25,299 --> 00:24:29,553
Leave Melissa alone. She doesn't need to
go through that any more.

302
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:34,224
- Where are the guns?
- The b-bunkers. Yeah.

303
00:24:35,017 --> 00:24:40,522
The Civil War bunkers. Vernon... Vernon...
Vernon and his goons know, but I don't.

304
00:24:40,898 --> 00:24:44,485
Maybe there's a map
of the battlefield in the records.

305
00:24:44,735 --> 00:24:46,737
You know how to find the other bunkers.

306
00:24:46,862 --> 00:24:47,988
Mulder...

307
00:24:50,074 --> 00:24:51,575
Melissa.

308
00:24:54,745 --> 00:24:56,080
It's me, Melissa.

309
00:24:59,249 --> 00:25:01,335
I want you to go back...

310
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,713
...back to the field.

311
00:25:16,392 --> 00:25:17,476
<i>(Sobs)</i>

312
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:24,942
Oh!

313
00:25:29,613 --> 00:25:33,033
(Southern <i>accent)</i>
Your eyes may have changed shade...

314
00:25:34,118 --> 00:25:37,538
...but it cannot colour the soul behind them.

315
00:25:38,956 --> 00:25:42,209
We have come together
in this life, this time...

316
00:25:42,793 --> 00:25:44,962
...only to meet in passing.

317
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,053
It is so heartbreaking to wait.

318
00:25:57,266 --> 00:25:59,101
I miss you.

319
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:17,661
Mulder, this is a product of her illness.

320
00:26:17,786 --> 00:26:22,249
She couldn't answer the question on the
battlefield. She gave us no specific names...

321
00:26:22,332 --> 00:26:24,918
...no information to prove her validity.

322
00:26:25,002 --> 00:26:28,255
There is nothing we can use
to prove this is the truth.

323
00:26:28,338 --> 00:26:29,590
There's one way.

324
00:26:29,673 --> 00:26:34,011
Ephesian's arraignment is in two hours.
There is no time to be doing this.

325
00:26:34,303 --> 00:26:36,513
Wouldn't you, Scully?

326
00:26:38,974 --> 00:26:40,976
Wouldn't anybody?

327
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:47,191
<i>(therapist)</i> I want you to go into your past,
beyond your life as Fox Mulder.

328
00:26:51,987 --> 00:26:53,363
What do you see?

329
00:27:01,789 --> 00:27:03,957
Ghetto streets.

330
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:08,712
Shattered glass.

331
00:27:11,381 --> 00:27:13,550
Bodies of the dead.

332
00:27:16,637 --> 00:27:18,639
I'm a woman...

333
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:23,227
...a Jewish woman.

334
00:27:23,352 --> 00:27:24,686
Poland.

335
00:27:28,357 --> 00:27:30,567
My son is with me.

336
00:27:34,071 --> 00:27:37,324
- He is Samantha.
- <i>(therapist)</i> Samantha?

337
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:40,744
I thought Samantha was your sister.

338
00:27:40,911 --> 00:27:43,080
In this life...

339
00:27:43,247 --> 00:27:45,415
...she is my son.

340
00:27:51,213 --> 00:27:53,382
I see my father.

341
00:27:59,012 --> 00:28:01,265
He's dead in the street.

342
00:28:07,771 --> 00:28:09,940
He is Scully.

343
00:28:10,858 --> 00:28:14,027
But now... He's gone on now.

344
00:28:15,696 --> 00:28:17,406
They're waiting for us.

345
00:28:18,699 --> 00:28:20,200
Souls...

346
00:28:21,285 --> 00:28:23,412
...come back together.

347
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:26,790
Different, ...

348
00:28:28,292 --> 00:28:30,794
...but always together...

349
00:28:31,461 --> 00:28:33,463
...again and again...

350
00:28:34,464 --> 00:28:36,216
...to learn.

351
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:39,136
I can't go to my father.

352
00:28:47,269 --> 00:28:48,604
<i>(sighs)</i>

353
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:51,982
Gestapo is standing next to him.

354
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,572
An officer.

355
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,161
He is Cancer Man.

356
00:29:05,078 --> 00:29:07,247
Evil returns as evil.

357
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:11,793
But love...

358
00:29:12,252 --> 00:29:14,254
...love...

359
00:29:14,338 --> 00:29:17,591
...souls mate... eternal.

360
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:24,431
My... husband...

361
00:29:24,973 --> 00:29:27,351
...is taken away from me...

362
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:30,812
...to the camps.

363
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:33,857
He is Melissa.

364
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:37,861
We're always taken away.

365
00:29:42,449 --> 00:29:44,534
I'm rising.

366
00:29:45,535 --> 00:29:47,829
I'm rising now.

367
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:54,836
I'm rising now...

368
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:57,881
...high above...

369
00:29:58,215 --> 00:30:00,342
...my body...

370
00:30:02,344 --> 00:30:04,513
...above the field.

371
00:30:05,055 --> 00:30:07,224
My face is bloody.

372
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:11,728
Near the bunker.

373
00:30:14,356 --> 00:30:16,566
The Federals are gone.

374
00:30:19,569 --> 00:30:21,863
My sergeant is also dead.

375
00:30:25,701 --> 00:30:26,994
He is Scully.

376
00:30:31,248 --> 00:30:33,500
Sarah holds me.

377
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:39,673
She is sad.

378
00:30:44,261 --> 00:30:46,263
She is Melissa.

379
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:51,059
She lives...

380
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:54,229
...near the battle.

381
00:30:55,772 --> 00:30:57,774
Hamilton County.

382
00:30:58,108 --> 00:31:00,402
Her name is Kavanaugh...

383
00:31:01,445 --> 00:31:03,238
Sarah Kavanaugh.

384
00:31:04,448 --> 00:31:06,575
And my name...

385
00:31:07,117 --> 00:31:09,286
...is Sullivan Biddle.

386
00:31:15,584 --> 00:31:17,794
She doesn't know.

387
00:31:19,588 --> 00:31:21,757
She doesn't know...

388
00:31:24,718 --> 00:31:27,220
...that I'm waiting for her...

389
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,146
...that we will live again.

390
00:31:38,982 --> 00:31:41,234
We will live again.

391
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:49,493
Oh, my soul is tired.

392
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:51,661
Mulder, it's Scully.

393
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:54,790
Do you see any bunkers in the field?

394
00:31:55,248 --> 00:31:57,501
My soul is tired.

395
00:32:03,006 --> 00:32:04,674
I wanna rest.

396
00:33:50,572 --> 00:33:54,117
<i>(Scully)</i> Ephesian's being taken down
to his arraignment.

397
00:33:54,409 --> 00:33:57,162
He and Melissa
are going to be released soon.

398
00:33:57,662 --> 00:34:00,040
Dana... if, um...

399
00:34:02,584 --> 00:34:06,004
...early in the four years
we've been working together...

400
00:34:07,505 --> 00:34:11,426
...an event occurred that suggested
or somebody told you that...

401
00:34:12,344 --> 00:34:14,763
...we'd been friends together...

402
00:34:14,846 --> 00:34:17,849
...in other lifetimes... always...

403
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:23,480
...would it have changed some of the ways
we looked at one another?

404
00:34:23,563 --> 00:34:25,899
Even if I knew for certain...

405
00:34:26,858 --> 00:34:29,069
...I wouldn't change a day.

406
00:34:35,367 --> 00:34:37,911
Well, maybe that "Flukeman" thing.

407
00:34:38,161 --> 00:34:40,997
I could have lived without that just fine.

408
00:34:44,542 --> 00:34:48,213
<i>(Sarah) We have come together
in this life, this time...</i>

409
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:50,048
<i>...only to meet in passing.</i>

410
00:34:52,926 --> 00:34:55,929
<i>It is so heartbreaking to wait.</i>

411
00:34:56,846 --> 00:34:58,223
<i>(Sarah sighing)</i>

412
00:35:00,183 --> 00:35:01,851
<i>I miss you.</i>

413
00:35:06,564 --> 00:35:09,734
- I don't believe in it.
- Why?

414
00:35:10,318 --> 00:35:14,489
Those tapes are saying we chose
the lives we live before we're born...

415
00:35:14,572 --> 00:35:16,491
...and who we live with.

416
00:35:18,785 --> 00:35:20,912
It's a nice idea.

417
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:24,666
It's a beautiful idea.

418
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:29,254
I wanna believe.

419
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:36,428
And if I knew it were true,
I'd want to start over.

420
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:41,516
I'd want to end this pointless life.

421
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,393
Sarah...

422
00:35:43,977 --> 00:35:46,062
...if it were true...

423
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,690
...no life would be pointless.

424
00:36:01,244 --> 00:36:02,579
<i>(door opens)</i>

425
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:04,622
Melissa...

426
00:36:05,915 --> 00:36:07,375
...it's time to leave.

427
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:39,115
I've reported to investigators
the possible existence of other bunkers.

428
00:36:39,491 --> 00:36:44,788
<i>The field is not the property of the Seven
Stars, so the BATF is continuing to search.</i>

429
00:36:45,413 --> 00:36:47,165
(girl) Mommy! They're home!

430
00:37:07,227 --> 00:37:09,312
The Attorney General is furious as is.

431
00:37:09,396 --> 00:37:11,898
We won't get a go-ahead
for a second move on the compound.

432
00:37:11,981 --> 00:37:16,361
Ephesian's followers believe that the FBI
and the ATF are the devil's army...

433
00:37:16,486 --> 00:37:19,572
...prophesied in Revelations 12:17
to make war on the seed...

434
00:37:19,656 --> 00:37:22,867
...keeping God's commandments
and the testimony of Jesus Christ.

435
00:37:22,992 --> 00:37:25,745
Revelations says Christian faith
defeats that army.

436
00:37:25,829 --> 00:37:30,625
You're saying he'll attack the ATF agents,
believing, as prophesied, he'll win?

437
00:37:30,708 --> 00:37:35,213
I would be saying that if I thought
he believed in Revelations in its entirety.

438
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:38,091
- But he hid the weapons.
- He knew he couldn't defeat us.

439
00:37:38,174 --> 00:37:40,468
If he doesn't believe
he can defeat that army...

440
00:37:40,552 --> 00:37:46,015
...he may think by denying himself and his
followers to the devil... You understand?...

441
00:37:46,099 --> 00:37:49,269
...he will achieve for them
the reward of life forevermore.

442
00:37:49,352 --> 00:37:51,187
Our worst fears will be realised.

443
00:37:52,522 --> 00:37:53,940
All members to worship.

444
00:37:54,023 --> 00:37:58,862
The Lord shall preserve you from all
your evils. He shall preserve your soul.

445
00:37:59,446 --> 00:38:03,992
All members to worship. The Lord
shall preserve you from all your evil.

446
00:38:04,075 --> 00:38:06,911
He shall preserve your soul.

447
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:13,418
"Marvel not, my brethren,
that the world hates you."

448
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:22,719
"We know we've passed from death into life
because we love the brethren."

449
00:38:23,094 --> 00:38:26,264
I will not remove our people.
We're close to finding the weapons.

450
00:38:26,389 --> 00:38:29,225
All I want is a cooling-off period.

451
00:38:29,309 --> 00:38:31,895
Ephesian's gathered all members
in the worship hall.

452
00:38:31,978 --> 00:38:35,190
A parabolic mike we have aimed
at the compound just picked this up.

The temple began running
an interference frequency.

First Epistle of John:

00:38:59,255 --> 00:39:04,260
"He laid down his life for us, and we ought
to lay down our lives for the brethren."

460
00:39:05,178 --> 00:39:06,304
OK, Mulder.

461
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:14,187

that do his commandments...

...that they may have the right
to the tree of life."

463
00:39:19,943 --> 00:39:21,611
My little children...

464
00:39:22,111 --> 00:39:26,157
...let us not love in word, neither in tongue...

465
00:39:26,616 --> 00:39:28,952
...but in deed and truth.

466
00:39:30,203 --> 00:39:32,789

Hold your fire! Hold your fire!

471
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:53,851
- Is there contact with the temple?
- If you call that "contact".

472
00:39:53,977 --> 00:39:56,229
He should be transported right away.
