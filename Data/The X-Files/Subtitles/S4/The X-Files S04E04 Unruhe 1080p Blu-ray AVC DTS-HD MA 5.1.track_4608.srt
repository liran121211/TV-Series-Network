1
00:00:17,936 --> 00:00:21,064
It's just a passport photo,
not the cover of Vogue.

2
00:00:21,148 --> 00:00:25,068
There's no reason I have to look
like hell in it, is there? Settle down.

3
00:00:25,152 --> 00:00:29,114
- We're on a schedule here.
- I know we're on a schedule here.

4
00:00:35,162 --> 00:00:36,914
Act natural.

5
00:00:46,340 --> 00:00:50,302
- I'll be back in ten.
- Make it five. I'll be around back.

6
00:00:50,427 --> 00:00:52,304
Relax, Billy.

7
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:02,105
Lower it just a bit. Yeah, that's it.

8
00:01:04,524 --> 00:01:06,944
Now, big smile. Yeah, hold it.

9
00:01:08,695 --> 00:01:12,991
- Big trip you got planned?
- Oh, you know, nothin' special.

10
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:14,993
Just good to have a passport.

11
00:01:15,953 --> 00:01:19,456
It looks like it's clearing up.
Might be a nice day after all.

12
00:01:19,873 --> 00:01:22,334
It's just gonna take a few minutes.

13
00:01:25,462 --> 00:01:28,215
That comes to $6.95.

14
00:01:31,218 --> 00:01:34,137
Great. I left my money in the car.

15
00:01:34,221 --> 00:01:36,682
- I'll be back.
- I'll be here.

Billy?

20
00:02:14,177 --> 00:02:17,681
Billy, someone did something to me. Billy?

My God!

26
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,128
(Mulder) What are your thoughts, Scully?

27
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:15,006
Have the local police been
contacted by her abductor?

28
00:04:15,132 --> 00:04:19,469
- No demand for ransom?
- No, unfortunately. It's going on three days.

29
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,013
Any additional leads?

30
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,767
No. No hair and fibre evidence.
The rain washed it all away.

31
00:04:25,851 --> 00:04:28,353
The autopsy came back
on the dead boyfriend.

32
00:04:28,478 --> 00:04:31,731
A puncture wound through
the eardrum and into the brain...

33
00:04:31,857 --> 00:04:33,942
...possibly from a long needle or an awl.

34
00:04:34,025 --> 00:04:36,945
I'm still not sure how we figure
into this investigation.

35
00:04:37,028 --> 00:04:39,197
Did you see the photo?

36
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:41,950
I assume that was taken by her abductor.

37
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:46,538
It was taken by a 65-year-old druggist
moments <i>before</i> she was abducted.

38
00:04:46,663 --> 00:04:49,124
That's a passport photo
from a local drugstore.

39
00:04:49,207 --> 00:04:53,003
The druggist was the last known person
to have seen Mary Lefante.

40
00:04:53,086 --> 00:04:55,714
He claims that wasn't the photo
he was taking.

41
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:58,383
He says the photo
he was taking was normal.

42
00:04:58,508 --> 00:05:01,303
He only came to the police
when he heard she was missing.

43
00:05:01,386 --> 00:05:05,974
Well, whoever took this photo was
obviously privy to the woman's abduction.

44
00:05:06,057 --> 00:05:08,894
That is what you would think.

45
00:05:11,855 --> 00:05:15,734
It's the damnedest thing.
Here it is, just like I left it.

46
00:05:15,859 --> 00:05:17,861
It was under lock and key.

47
00:05:17,944 --> 00:05:20,113
- Is that where you keep it?
- Yeah.

48
00:05:20,238 --> 00:05:23,366
- Mind if I take a look?
- Please, help yourself.

49
00:05:24,868 --> 00:05:28,538
At first I thought I did something wrong
when I took the picture.

50
00:05:28,747 --> 00:05:33,627
There's that piece of paper you have
to pull off. You have to do that just right.

51
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,546
(Mulder) I'm sure you did it just fine.

52
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:39,633
- Your film's out of date.
- Is that against the law?

53
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:44,846
- No. I was just making an observation.
- I don't get much call for passport photos.

54
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:48,058
The copy shop over at the mall
does 'em cheaper.

55
00:05:48,642 --> 00:05:51,520
<i>- (phone rings)
- Excuse me.</i>

56
00:05:51,603 --> 00:05:55,398
I sure hope you find that
young woman safe and sound.

57
00:06:01,613 --> 00:06:05,450
Which one of us gets to use the stun gun
on Bruno Hauptmann back there?

58
00:06:05,575 --> 00:06:08,453
So he doesn't exactly
stand out as a suspect.

59
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:12,457
Mulder, take a look at this.
You see this smeariness here?

60
00:06:13,124 --> 00:06:15,001
I'm thinking it's heat damage.

61
00:06:15,126 --> 00:06:20,090
With the heater sitting under the film,
the emulsion probably melted.

62
00:06:20,173 --> 00:06:23,802
That would make it look like
she posed screaming for a passport photo?

63
00:06:23,927 --> 00:06:26,096
Plus, the film is two years out of date.

64
00:06:26,179 --> 00:06:31,434
The photographic chemistry could've
changed. The dyes... fade, they...

65
00:06:31,518 --> 00:06:35,480
- All right, so what's your theory?
- I'm not sure I have a theory.

66
00:06:35,605 --> 00:06:37,440
<i>(shop-door bell dings)</i>

67
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:42,237
- Excuse me. You the two FBI agents?
- Agents Mulder and Scully.

68
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:47,284
Sorry to have brought you all this way.
I'm afraid we might have wasted your time.

69
00:06:48,827 --> 00:06:50,996
<i>(camera shutter clicks)</i>

70
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:55,333
Hey, Trott.

71
00:07:05,677 --> 00:07:08,930
Inspector Puett,
these are Agents Scully and Mulder.

72
00:07:09,014 --> 00:07:10,932
- Agents.
- Inspector.

73
00:07:11,016 --> 00:07:14,686
US postal inspector.
My office is investigating a mail theft...

74
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:18,315
...which we've traced to your missing person,
Ms Mary Louise Lefante.

75
00:07:18,398 --> 00:07:19,899
She was a postal employee.

76
00:07:20,025 --> 00:07:24,696
A sorter at the Kurland Hills branch.
A number of unsigned credit cards...

77
00:07:24,821 --> 00:07:29,034
...in transit through that branch
never made it to their respective owners.

78
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:30,827
She was intercepting them?

79
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:35,957
And her boyfriend was signing them. We ran
him. He was into forgery, cheque fraud.

80
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:40,629
Mary Lefante's passport photo. Do you know
how soon she wanted to leave town?

81
00:07:40,712 --> 00:07:43,715
- Did she know about your investigation?
- Probably.

82
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,969
Though we didn't focus on her specifically
until after she came up missing.

83
00:07:48,053 --> 00:07:51,681
- You think she faked her disappearance?
- Looks that way to me.

84
00:07:51,765 --> 00:07:55,226
Yeah, but why would she stab
her boyfriend through the ear?

85
00:07:56,394 --> 00:07:58,772
The magic was gone?

86
00:07:58,897 --> 00:08:01,399
Did you find a camera anywhere here?

87
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:15,538
You think this woman planted
that photo of herself in the drugstore?

88
00:08:15,622 --> 00:08:18,750
- What would be the point of that?
- I...

89
00:08:21,252 --> 00:08:23,296
Here it is.

90
00:08:25,924 --> 00:08:28,218
Stand back, Scully. It's loaded.

91
00:08:29,636 --> 00:08:33,056
- What are you doing?
- In the '60s a bellhop named Ted Serios...

92
00:08:33,139 --> 00:08:37,060
...became famous for taking
what he called "thoughtographs".

93
00:08:37,143 --> 00:08:40,188
He claimed that by concentrating
on an unexposed negative...

94
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:45,235
...he could create a photographic
representation of what he saw in his mind.

95
00:08:45,318 --> 00:08:48,405
He did landscapes, cathedrals,
the Queen of England...

96
00:08:48,488 --> 00:08:51,116
- Thoughtographs.
- Also known as scotographs.

97
00:08:51,241 --> 00:08:55,036
Literature on thought photography
dates back almost to Louis Daguerre.

98
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,288
So that makes it legitimate?

99
00:08:58,456 --> 00:09:00,625
Look at that.

100
00:09:01,167 --> 00:09:03,795
<i>(Scully) Oh. my Gem!</i>

101
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:11,469
- I think he was here, Scully.
- Who was here?

102
00:09:11,594 --> 00:09:14,848
Mary Lefante's abductor.
I think he stalked her.

103
00:09:17,642 --> 00:09:19,728
He could have come up right here.

104
00:09:19,811 --> 00:09:23,732
I think he came in here and looked at her
through the window, this close.

105
00:09:23,815 --> 00:09:26,151
Close enough to affect the camera film.

106
00:09:26,276 --> 00:09:28,570
Psychic photography?

107
00:09:28,653 --> 00:09:32,157
Mulder, it's obvious
that somebody doctored these images...

108
00:09:32,282 --> 00:09:36,619
...and planted them to be found here.
Maybe as some kind of a smoke screen.

109
00:09:36,703 --> 00:09:39,122
To conceal what?
This isn't about mail fraud.

110
00:09:39,205 --> 00:09:41,624
That's just incidental. What if...

111
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,461
What if someone had this ability?

112
00:09:44,544 --> 00:09:47,964
An image like this
would be a peek into that person's mind.

113
00:09:48,047 --> 00:09:52,177
- Into their darkest fantasies?
- The fantasy of a killer.

114
00:10:17,035 --> 00:10:19,329
<i>(car horn)</i>

115
00:10:26,211 --> 00:10:28,505
<i>(burst of siren)</i>

116
00:10:29,214 --> 00:10:31,508
<i>(police radio)</i>

117
00:10:32,217 --> 00:10:34,135
She's completely non-responsive.

118
00:10:34,219 --> 00:10:37,639
We did a tox screen and found traces
of morphine and scopolamine.

119
00:10:37,722 --> 00:10:40,141
- Twilite Sleep.
- The dental anaesthetic?

120
00:10:40,225 --> 00:10:43,019
A painkiller cocktail.
It's also for women in labour.

121
00:10:43,102 --> 00:10:45,563
- Would that account for her condition?
- No.

122
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,565
<i>(Mulder) What</i> would?

123
00:10:48,233 --> 00:10:50,235
Give her a PET scan.

124
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:57,367
All set.

125
00:11:04,082 --> 00:11:06,292
Oh, my God!

126
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:08,628
What is it?

127
00:11:08,753 --> 00:11:14,634
She's been given a transorbital lobotomy.
It used to be known as an ice-pick lobotomy.

128
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:18,763
It involves inserting a leucotome
through the eye sockets.

129
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,975
We're looking for a doctor?
Someone with training?

130
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:26,729
- Notjudging by this.
- Whoever did this, Mulder, did it wrong.

131
00:11:26,813 --> 00:11:28,773
<i>(Weakly) Un...</i>

132
00:11:30,483 --> 00:11:32,777

<i>Unruhe.</i>

<i>Un...</i>

137
00:11:45,832 --> 00:11:48,251
You'd better go in there and get her.

138
00:11:56,009 --> 00:11:58,094
<i>Unruhe.</i>

139
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:02,473
<i>Unruhe.</i>

140
00:12:04,267 --> 00:12:06,019
<i>Unruhe.</i>

141
00:12:06,853 --> 00:12:09,814
We just got the call.
There's been a second abduction.

142
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:11,858
<i>Unruhe.</i>

143
00:12:12,483 --> 00:12:14,360

00:12:39,510 --> 00:12:42,013
<i>(muffled screams)</i>

00:12:49,854 --> 00:12:52,357
(man) You can roll. We're set here.

150
00:12:53,816 --> 00:12:56,819
(man) Get that area taped off.

151
00:13:03,868 --> 00:13:05,870
Watch it.

152
00:13:06,371 --> 00:13:08,539
Excuse me, ma'am.

153
00:13:13,378 --> 00:13:17,674
- Mulder?
- Charles Selchik, certified public accountant.

154
00:13:17,757 --> 00:13:22,136
Dead from a stab wound through the ear.
Cleaning crew found the body.

155
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,099
- What about the missing woman?
- His secretary, Alice Brandt, age 32.

156
00:13:26,224 --> 00:13:28,434
The family says
she was working late last night.

157
00:13:28,559 --> 00:13:33,398
- What's her connection to the first victim?
- Apparently none. But the MO is the same.

158
00:13:33,523 --> 00:13:36,234
- Yeah. The clock is running.
- Yeah.

159
00:13:36,359 --> 00:13:39,696
I keep thinking about what Mary Lefante
was repeating: "unruhe. "

160
00:13:39,779 --> 00:13:44,659
The Michigan phone book has three different
spellings, but none within 80 miles of here.

161
00:13:44,742 --> 00:13:46,577
It might be significant as a word.

162
00:13:46,703 --> 00:13:50,790
That's what I've been thinking.
In German it means "trouble" or "strife."

163
00:13:50,915 --> 00:13:54,127
- Unrest.
- You took German in high school, Scully?

164
00:13:54,252 --> 00:13:57,797
- College.
- Unrest, huh?

165
00:13:57,922 --> 00:14:01,134
I'm working on these crime-scene photos
from the first abduction.

166
00:14:01,259 --> 00:14:06,639
If we're lucky, the abductor gets a thrill
from returning to the scene of a crime.

167
00:14:06,764 --> 00:14:08,307
He wasn't there, Scully.

168
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:10,727
- How do you know?
- It would've affected the photos.

169
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:13,938
- Trott, what did you find?
- Nothing much.

170
00:14:14,063 --> 00:14:16,441
There's no cameras or film here whatsoever.

171
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:20,611
It's all just accountants' offices,
so I don't know why there would be.

172
00:14:21,738 --> 00:14:25,241
Is that what we're looking for?
Evidence of psychic photography?

173
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:26,951
It may be the only evidence we get.

174
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:29,871
I've got a forensics team
coming from Detroit.

175
00:14:29,954 --> 00:14:33,541
What's here for them to find?
This guy's very good at what he does.

176
00:14:33,624 --> 00:14:36,169
He's left no witnesses, no latent prints...

177
00:14:36,294 --> 00:14:40,214
Only those photos, which makes me believe
he doesn't know he has that ability.

178
00:14:40,298 --> 00:14:43,926
We haven't found
any new psychic photos here either.

179
00:14:55,146 --> 00:14:57,023
Wait a second.

180
00:15:03,488 --> 00:15:04,655
I wanna show you something.

181
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:17,460
Right here. This.

182
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:21,380
And look.

183
00:15:21,506 --> 00:15:26,260
It's the same company. What if the kidnapper
was working construction at both sites?

184
00:15:26,344 --> 00:15:28,930
He would've been able
to pick out the two women.

185
00:15:29,013 --> 00:15:32,683
- Check it out. Let me know what you find.
- Where are you gonna be?

186
00:15:33,184 --> 00:15:37,522
Back in DC. I want Special Photo to run this.
I still think the answer's in here.

187
00:15:37,647 --> 00:15:40,483
What if it's not?
This woman's time is running out.

188
00:15:40,566 --> 00:15:45,613
All the more reason to fully investigate
the one hard piece of evidence we do have.

189
00:15:45,696 --> 00:15:47,698
I'll be in touch.

190
00:15:56,499 --> 00:15:58,209
<i>(footsteps approaching)</i>

191
00:15:58,334 --> 00:16:00,336
<i>(muffled whimpers)</i>

192
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:04,757
<i>Das ist fur dich.</i>

193
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:08,386
<i>Es ist wie das, das sie getragen hat.</i>

194
00:16:10,721 --> 00:16:13,933
Get away from me!
Get away from me, you bastard!

195
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:16,394
- Shh.
- Let me go...

196
00:16:19,564 --> 00:16:23,776
<i>Bald. Leise. Sehr bald.</i>

197
00:16:34,412 --> 00:16:36,789
(Mulder) Can you get rid
of the blurriness here?

198
00:16:36,914 --> 00:16:40,710
Yeah. I just need to mark a place
where the blur comes to a point...

199
00:16:40,793 --> 00:16:43,254
...and let the computer do its business.

200
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:48,718
Bingo. Lord, look at that!

201
00:16:48,801 --> 00:16:51,971
- This guy's an artist.
- Why do you say that?

202
00:16:52,096 --> 00:16:53,764
However he did this...

203
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:57,226
...however he put this together,
it's seamless.

204
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:01,480
What about this face?
Can you bring that up?

205
00:17:01,606 --> 00:17:03,274
Wait a second. Let's try.

206
00:17:10,281 --> 00:17:13,242
- I think I can sweeten it more.
- OK, do that.

207
00:17:26,964 --> 00:17:27,798
What have you got?

208
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:32,345
From the construction company employees,
18 workers overlapped on both job sites.

209
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:35,681
- We're checking, but so far nothing.
- What about day labourers?

210
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:39,393
Mr lskendarian there
doesn't hire workers off the books.

211
00:17:39,477 --> 00:17:41,062
I don't want IRS trouble.

212
00:17:41,145 --> 00:17:44,732
But his foreman might hire cash-only
day labour without his knowledge.

213
00:17:44,815 --> 00:17:47,526
He's got seven job sites going now,
as many foremen.

214
00:17:47,652 --> 00:17:51,781
Gather officers to canvass. Which foreman
works the Midlothian Corporate Park?

215
00:17:51,864 --> 00:17:54,909
- That job's finished.
- Find out where he is today.

216
00:17:54,992 --> 00:17:56,619
I'll take that one.

217
00:17:56,702 --> 00:17:57,995
Can I use your phone?

218
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:01,290
OK, thank you.

219
00:18:01,374 --> 00:18:04,335
NCIC shows no match for that man.

220
00:18:11,676 --> 00:18:14,512
What about this shape up here?
What is that?

221
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,853
Can you take that and flip it
so that that's on the bottom?

222
00:18:28,067 --> 00:18:30,194
Is that a shadow?

223
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:35,199
Yeah. It is.

224
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:38,369
It's somebody's shadow.

225
00:18:40,871 --> 00:18:44,959
It's the kidnapper's shadow.
It's like he's looming over her.

226
00:18:45,042 --> 00:18:47,962
It's like he... he's standing over her.

227
00:18:48,045 --> 00:18:51,924
He means to pass judgment on her,
like a god.

228
00:19:10,568 --> 00:19:12,403
Hello?

229
00:19:18,743 --> 00:19:20,411
Hello?

230
00:19:34,884 --> 00:19:36,594
Hello?

231
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:44,268
<i>(clanking thuds)</i>

232
00:19:49,815 --> 00:19:51,484
Hello?

233
00:19:59,992 --> 00:20:02,787
Hi. Can I help you?

234
00:20:03,829 --> 00:20:06,332
Uh, I hope so. Are you the foreman?

235
00:20:06,457 --> 00:20:10,920
- Yes, ma'am. I'm Gerry Schnauz.
- I'm Special Agent Dana Scully.

236
00:20:11,003 --> 00:20:14,632
I'd like to ask you some questions
about the day labourers you hire.

237
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:18,594
- What, is this some IRS thing or...
- No, sir, not at all.

238
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:21,972
My crew's at lunch
if you want to talk to anybody, but...

239
00:20:22,098 --> 00:20:25,309
...everybody I've got on today
is on the books, as far as I know.

240
00:20:26,102 --> 00:20:27,937
- (phone <i>rings)</i>
- Excuse me. Sorry.

241
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:29,647
Yeah, sure.

242
00:20:30,439 --> 00:20:33,359
<i>- Scully.
- I may have something for you...</i>

243
00:20:33,484 --> 00:20:35,653
...on the kidnapper. It's, uh...

244
00:20:35,778 --> 00:20:38,114
- <i>...something about his legs.</i>
- Yeah?

245
00:20:38,197 --> 00:20:41,909
<i>They're unusually long.
They're out of proportion.</i>

246
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:46,372
<i>I'm thinking he's either very tall,
or he's not, but wants to be.</i>

247
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:49,458
<i>Scully?</i>

248
00:20:49,834 --> 00:20:52,002
<i>Scully, are you there?</i>

249
00:20:57,675 --> 00:20:59,009
<i>Unruhe.</i>

250
00:21:01,637 --> 00:21:03,180
Stand where you are!

251
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:17,528
Don't move!

252
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,658
Stop or I'll shoot!

253
00:21:43,846 --> 00:21:46,390
Lace your fingers behind your head.

254
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:48,392
Do it!

255
00:22:25,095 --> 00:22:27,890
- Who?
- Alice Brandt.

256
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:33,604
The second woman that you abducted.
That's her name, Gerry.

257
00:22:34,605 --> 00:22:36,815
Where is Alice Brandt?

258
00:22:37,775 --> 00:22:39,485
I don't...

259
00:22:39,735 --> 00:22:42,571
I have no earthly idea
what you're talking about.

260
00:22:43,239 --> 00:22:45,115
Tell us where she is, Gerry.

261
00:22:45,241 --> 00:22:47,076
I'm sorry.

262
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:50,663
This is a case of mistaken identity
or something.

263
00:22:50,788 --> 00:22:52,790
I honestly...

264
00:22:52,915 --> 00:22:56,293
...honestly have no idea
what you're talking about.

265
00:22:58,963 --> 00:23:00,798
Explain this.

266
00:23:02,591 --> 00:23:07,930
We're running Sheetrock. I use that to start
the holes in it to keyhole in all the fixtures.

267
00:23:08,013 --> 00:23:12,434
- No. You used this to kill the two men.
- What two men?

268
00:23:12,518 --> 00:23:15,062
You used this on Mary Lefante!

269
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:19,525
Who? W... wait.
A minute ago it was Alice Brandt.

270
00:23:19,775 --> 00:23:23,696
I don't believe this.
I do not believe this is happening.

271
00:23:23,821 --> 00:23:27,700
You want to tell us about the first time
you were arrested, Gerry?

272
00:23:27,825 --> 00:23:32,997
<i>(Scully)</i> In 1980 you attacked
your father with an axe handle.

273
00:23:33,872 --> 00:23:38,627
You beat him so severely that he spent
the remainder of his life in a wheelchair.

274
00:23:39,295 --> 00:23:42,339
I was not jailed. I was institutionalised.

275
00:23:42,464 --> 00:23:46,135
I had a kind of chemical imbalance.

276
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:52,975
Yeah. "Gerald Schnauz, treated
for a paranoid schizophrenic disorder."

277
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:57,021
"Six years in Melvoyne Psychiatric Hospital.
Released 1986."

278
00:23:58,814 --> 00:24:01,984
So what you been up to since 1986, Gerry?

279
00:24:03,027 --> 00:24:05,404
Taking care of my father.

280
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:09,033
Looking after him 24 hours a day.

281
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:12,870
Making amends.

282
00:24:16,415 --> 00:24:20,044
He, uh, passed away in January.

283
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:22,838
How did you feel about that?

284
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:26,550
Sad.

285
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,387
It says here you have a sister.

286
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:34,683
Where is your sister, Gerry?

287
00:24:34,767 --> 00:24:36,810
She passed.

288
00:24:36,894 --> 00:24:40,439
Actually, it says here
she committed suicide in 1980.

289
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:43,859
God, that was a bad year.

290
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:47,946
What else happened in 1980, Gerry?

291
00:24:48,072 --> 00:24:50,240
Well, John Lennon got shot.

292
00:24:51,533 --> 00:24:54,328
Where are you going with this?
Are you Sigmund Freud?

293
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:59,249
- Why don't you cut the BS?
- Why don't we get back to Alice Brandt?

294
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:01,585
Where is she?

295
00:25:10,386 --> 00:25:12,596
You look troubled.

296
00:25:16,934 --> 00:25:19,061
Hey, Gerry?

297
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:25,275
This your father?

298
00:25:29,655 --> 00:25:34,118
- Where'd you get that?
- You left that for me. Left it like a fingerprint.

299
00:25:40,457 --> 00:25:44,086
Is this what you see
when you close your eyes, Gerry?

300
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:55,139
Is that what you see?

301
00:25:59,476 --> 00:26:01,145
Gerry, ...

302
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:04,314
...tell me where Alice Brandt is.

303
00:26:08,318 --> 00:26:10,654
She's safe...

304
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:13,657
...from the howlers.

305
00:26:19,538 --> 00:26:22,040
She's all right now.

306
00:26:24,001 --> 00:26:28,005
Gerry, tell me how I can find her.

307
00:26:29,548 --> 00:26:32,509

Right up ahead.

311

Scully, that word unruhe, unrest-
it's bothering me.

312
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:52,631
Maybe he thought he was curing them.
Saving them from damnation.

313
00:27:52,965 --> 00:27:56,468
From those things in the pictures.
He called them "the howlers."

314
00:27:56,593 --> 00:27:57,886
It's over, Mulder.

315
00:27:57,970 --> 00:28:01,348
Then that photo wouldn't be his fantasy.
It would be his nightmare.

316
00:28:01,431 --> 00:28:04,101
What the hell does it matter?

317
00:28:04,768 --> 00:28:06,979
- Because I wanna know.
- I don't.

318
00:28:09,273 --> 00:28:11,149
<i>(engine starts)</i>

319
00:28:19,283 --> 00:28:21,159
(Trott) OK, Gerry.

320
00:28:22,452 --> 00:28:25,289
Put it all in here.
Wallet, jewellery, everything.

321
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,929
Eyes straight ahead.

322
00:28:46,143 --> 00:28:48,353

323
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:04,703

324
00:29:10,292 --> 00:29:12,210
<i>(gunshot)</i>

325
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:27,142
Mulder.

326
00:29:30,687 --> 00:29:33,774
This wound's in the wrong place.
He was shot in the throat.

327
00:29:33,857 --> 00:29:35,776
He wasn't trying to save this victim.

328
00:29:35,859 --> 00:29:41,031
We just got a report of a robbery at the
drugstore where the first victim disappeared.

329
00:29:50,874 --> 00:29:52,876
What happened?

330
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:11,853
Thank you.

331
00:30:13,772 --> 00:30:15,691
It was Gerry.

332
00:30:15,774 --> 00:30:17,985
He took the passport camera
and all the film.

333
00:30:18,068 --> 00:30:22,030
And morphine, scopolamine
hydrobromide and insulin syringes.

334
00:30:22,114 --> 00:30:26,368
- He's making more Twilite Sleep.
- He wants to continue his work.

335
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:31,748
You know that job site
that I arrested him at, Mulder?

336
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:36,503
What if he's picked out his next victim?
There were apartment buildings on all sides.

337
00:30:36,586 --> 00:30:39,256
You think you interrupted his stalking?

338
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:40,841
Let's go.

339
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:45,971
Hold on a second. Bring the car around.
I just wanna wait for this. I'll be right there.

340
00:30:50,475 --> 00:30:52,477
<i>(dials)</i>

341
00:30:56,440 --> 00:31:00,360
- Corning.
- Corning. Send units to Belmont Avenue.

342
00:31:00,444 --> 00:31:04,656
Check all the apartments near that job site.
I think he's heading back there.

343
00:31:04,781 --> 00:31:06,783
<i>- Got it.
- Thanks.</i>

344
00:31:23,592 --> 00:31:25,302
Ow!

345
00:31:37,856 --> 00:31:39,816
<i>(beeping)</i>

346
00:32:02,297 --> 00:32:03,840
Scully!

347
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:05,801
Scully!

348
00:32:11,473 --> 00:32:12,682
Scully!

349
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,548
Sir?

350
00:32:45,465 --> 00:32:49,970
Agent Scully's Explorerjust turned up at
a park and ride about 20 miles up the US 81.

351
00:32:50,053 --> 00:32:53,932
- Any sightings?
- A report of an Audi stolen from the same lot.

352
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:57,769
He's switching cars.
He's gonna do that two or three times.

353
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:02,440
He's got six fingers here.

354
00:33:03,608 --> 00:33:05,068
Sir?

355
00:33:05,318 --> 00:33:08,822
He's got six fingers.
What about his apartment?

356
00:33:08,905 --> 00:33:11,241
We got a unit there.
But he ain't comin' back.

357
00:33:11,408 --> 00:33:14,995
What about friends, coworkers?
Does he have a summerhouse?

358
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:16,997
He doesn't have much of anything.

359
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:19,666
We're running some phone numbers
from his wallet...

360
00:33:19,749 --> 00:33:22,085
Let me see his wallet.

361
00:33:27,591 --> 00:33:30,427
It's his father's obituary.

362
00:33:32,804 --> 00:33:36,725
"Recipient of the Bronze Star Medal
during the Korean War."

363
00:33:36,808 --> 00:33:40,020
"Gerald Schnauz Sr, DDS."

364
00:33:41,271 --> 00:33:43,481
He was a retired dentist.

365
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,399
He was here.

366
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,736
Why would he take the chair?

367
00:35:24,874 --> 00:35:26,876
Let me go.

368
00:35:29,045 --> 00:35:30,380
Shh!

369
00:35:30,463 --> 00:35:33,133
<i>Es ist alles in Ordnung.</i>

370
00:35:35,969 --> 00:35:39,514
It's over, Gerry. Let me go right now.

371
00:35:39,597 --> 00:35:45,770
<i>Ich werde dir helfen.
Du wirst deine Unruhe bald vergessen.</i>

372
00:35:59,951 --> 00:36:03,913
Yes, you do.
Everybody does. But especially you.

373
00:36:03,997 --> 00:36:05,749
Why?

374
00:36:06,958 --> 00:36:09,002
Why me, Gerry?

375
00:36:09,085 --> 00:36:11,963
Do I remind you of your sister?

376
00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:18,678
Why did your sister kill herself, Gerry?
What did your father do to her?

377
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:21,222
He didn't do anything. It was the howlers.

378
00:36:21,306 --> 00:36:24,184
OK. Then let's talk about the howlers.

379
00:36:29,606 --> 00:36:34,486
They live inside your head. They make you
do things and say things that you don't mean.

380
00:36:34,861 --> 00:36:40,116
And all your good thoughts
can't wish them away. You need help.

381
00:36:40,658 --> 00:36:42,452
You've got them...

382
00:36:43,203 --> 00:36:45,038
...right there.

383
00:36:45,789 --> 00:36:47,207
Don't you feel them?

384
00:36:47,290 --> 00:36:50,085
- I don't have them, Gerry.
- See?

385
00:36:50,168 --> 00:36:55,757
They made you say that just now
because they know I'm going to kill them.

386
00:36:55,840 --> 00:37:00,553
What if you're wrong, Gerry?
What if there are no such things as howlers?

387
00:37:00,637 --> 00:37:03,264
What if you made them up
inside your head...

388
00:37:03,348 --> 00:37:07,185
...to explain the things
your sister said your father did?

389
00:37:07,977 --> 00:37:12,440
Great. Now they got <i>you</i> talking
like Sigmund Freud.

390
00:37:12,524 --> 00:37:14,943
I am on to you!

391
00:37:15,026 --> 00:37:17,362
I know your tricks!

392
00:37:18,488 --> 00:37:21,408
Besides, I've seen them...

393
00:37:21,491 --> 00:37:24,452
...in that picture that your partner
showed me.

394
00:37:24,536 --> 00:37:26,496
Pictures don't lie.

395
00:37:26,996 --> 00:37:29,416
You saw them too.

396
00:37:29,499 --> 00:37:32,877
If there are such things as howlers, Gerry...

397
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:38,842
...they live only inside your head.

398
00:38:05,285 --> 00:38:08,413
<i>(whirring)</i>

399
00:38:34,647 --> 00:38:36,232
Six fingers, right?

400
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:40,236
- We've got the state police...
- Why are there six?

401
00:38:40,737 --> 00:38:41,529
What?

402
00:38:41,613 --> 00:38:47,160
We've got the state police looking as far
south as Grand Rapids. Still no sign of her.

403
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:52,415
- Agent Mulder, what do we do?
- Damn it.

404
00:39:01,341 --> 00:39:03,259
One, two...

405
00:39:03,343 --> 00:39:05,803
There's five headstones.

406
00:39:12,185 --> 00:39:14,395
And the father makes six. Come on!

407
00:39:14,479 --> 00:39:16,648
Let's go! Let's go!

408
00:39:22,028 --> 00:39:24,697
<i>(vehicles approaching)</i>

409
00:39:34,791 --> 00:39:36,960
(Mulder) Fan out! Check the tree line!

410
00:40:05,530 --> 00:40:08,408
What does... What does this mean?

411
00:40:09,534 --> 00:40:11,995
It means you need help, Gerry.

412
00:40:23,673 --> 00:40:28,595
No, I think what it means
is that I don't have much time left.

413
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:38,396
No, Gerry, stop!

414
00:40:39,522 --> 00:40:41,399
- <i>(muffled cries)</i>
- Shh.

415
00:40:42,775 --> 00:40:44,360
<i>(creaking)</i>

416
00:40:44,444 --> 00:40:47,905
<i>(muffled cries continue)</i>

417
00:41:14,265 --> 00:41:15,558
Scully!

418
00:41:18,394 --> 00:41:19,812
Mulder!

419
00:41:19,896 --> 00:41:21,439
In here!

420
00:41:21,564 --> 00:41:25,151
Mulder, help! Mulder!

421
00:41:27,070 --> 00:41:28,988
Scully!

422
00:41:39,624 --> 00:41:42,251
- Are you hurt?
- No.

423
00:41:42,335 --> 00:41:44,003
<i>(footsteps approaching)</i>

424
00:41:45,296 --> 00:41:47,256
Get an ambulance!

<i>(Scully) Addendum to case report.</i>

426
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:42,979
<i>After his death...</i>

427
00:42:43,062 --> 00:42:47,567
<i>...a diary was found among
Gerald Schnauz's belongings...</i>

428
00:42:48,317 --> 00:42:54,949
<i>...written in the second person and apparently
intended as an open letter to his father.</i>

429
00:42:55,032 --> 00:42:58,327
<i>It includes the names of his victims.</i>

430
00:42:58,411 --> 00:43:00,830
<i>The women he desired to save.</i>

431
00:43:02,331 --> 00:43:06,669
<i>My name is contained in the last entry.</i>

432
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:15,011
<i>I have no further explanation
for the existence of the photographs...</i>

433
00:43:15,094 --> 00:43:18,014
<i>...nor am I confident one is forthcoming.</i>

434
00:43:21,768 --> 00:43:24,270
<i>My captivity forced me to understand...</i>

435
00:43:24,353 --> 00:43:28,024
<i>...and even empathise with Gerry Schnauz.</i>

436
00:43:28,274 --> 00:43:31,611
<i>My survival depended on it.</i>

437
00:43:35,364 --> 00:43:39,744
<i>I see now the value of such insight.</i>

438
00:43:39,869 --> 00:43:44,415
<i>For truly to pursue monsters,
we must understand them, .</i> ..

439
00:43:46,292 --> 00:43:49,378
<i>...we must venture into their minds.</i>

<i>Only, in doing so...</i>

441
00:43:56,052 --> 00:43:59,931
<i>...do we risk letting them venture into ours?</i>
