<i>We should be on the ground in 15 minutes.</i>

<i>Any passenger needing help

<i>Monsieur?</i>

00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,418
<i>Monsieur?</i>

<i>(screams)</i>

<i>(Skinner) Come 'm.</i>

12
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:05,205
- Thank you for getting here so quickly.
- There's not much traffic at this hour.

13
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:10,085
This is Dr Simon Bruin with the Philadelphia
office of the Centers for Disease Control.

14
00:04:10,168 --> 00:04:12,796
A pleasure, Dr Scully.

15
00:04:15,298 --> 00:04:19,136
How familiar are you
with the kidnappings in Philadelphia?

16
00:04:19,219 --> 00:04:24,558
Only what I've read: that four young men
have gone missing in the past three months.

17
00:04:24,641 --> 00:04:26,226
All African-American.

18
00:04:26,309 --> 00:04:30,564
A joint FBI-Philadelphia PD task force
has been working around the clock.

19
00:04:30,647 --> 00:04:34,234
But there have been no leads to speak of.
Until last night.

20
00:04:34,317 --> 00:04:36,153
What happened last night?

21
00:04:36,236 --> 00:04:40,574
Owen Sanders, the last to go missing,
was found dead near a construction site.

22
00:04:40,657 --> 00:04:44,953
- How was he killed?
- That's just it, Agent Scully. He wasn't.

23
00:04:45,036 --> 00:04:47,080
No evidence indicates homicide.

24
00:04:47,164 --> 00:04:49,332
Has a cause of death been determined?

25
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:52,961
No. But I'll let Dr Bruin
give you his thoughts on that.

26
00:04:55,255 --> 00:04:59,843
This was taken last night, less than
an hour after Sanders' body was found.

27
00:04:59,926 --> 00:05:04,264
- I thought you said Owen Sanders was black.
- He was.

28
00:05:05,265 --> 00:05:07,350
I'm not sure I follow.

29
00:05:07,851 --> 00:05:10,395
See for yourself.

30
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,190
Owen Sanders
was a normal young black man.

31
00:05:13,273 --> 00:05:16,109
I assume you're going somewhere with this.

32
00:05:16,193 --> 00:05:20,864
The depigmentation may
actually be characteristic of a disease.

33
00:05:20,947 --> 00:05:22,908
An apparently fatal one.

34
00:05:24,868 --> 00:05:27,787
So you don't think
they're victims of a crime at all.

35
00:05:27,871 --> 00:05:33,043
It's my opinion, Dr Scully, this investigation
should begin and end under a microscope.

36
00:05:33,877 --> 00:05:37,130
Dr Bruin hopes someone
with a solid medical background...

37
00:05:37,214 --> 00:05:39,216
...can make a quick and decisive analysis.

38
00:05:41,259 --> 00:05:45,430
Case number 2139318537.

39
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:48,850
Subject is a black male, 19 years old.

40
00:05:48,934 --> 00:05:52,062
Cause and time of death unknown.

41
00:05:52,145 --> 00:05:56,816
Note: total lack of pigment in the skin,
hair and eyes.

42
00:05:57,651 --> 00:06:01,571
This suggests albinism,
though the bleaching of the irises...

43
00:06:01,655 --> 00:06:06,785
...indicates a violent and unexplained cellular
reaction to a vector or an environment...

44
00:06:06,868 --> 00:06:08,245
<i>(door opens)</i>

45
00:06:08,328 --> 00:06:13,124
Hey. I heard you were down here
slicing and dicing. Who's the lucky stiff?

46
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,252
His name is Owen Sanders.

47
00:06:15,335 --> 00:06:18,380
Reported as the fourth
kidnap victim in Philadelphia...

48
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:21,383
...until he turned up last night like this.

49
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:25,262
There's a Michael Jackson joke in here,
but I can't quite find it.

50
00:06:25,345 --> 00:06:29,307
I've been requested to determine
what leached the pigment from his body.

51
00:06:29,391 --> 00:06:32,352
- Requested by whom?
- The Centers for Disease Control.

52
00:06:32,435 --> 00:06:34,354
The CDC in a kidnap case?

53
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:37,440
They believe the case has been mislabelled.

54
00:06:37,691 --> 00:06:41,403
That this man and the others may have
fallen prey to a disease or a pathogen.

55
00:06:41,486 --> 00:06:43,363
Based on what other evidence?

56
00:06:43,446 --> 00:06:48,868
There were no signs of trauma or defence
wounds, and his wallet was still full of cash.

57
00:06:49,744 --> 00:06:51,871
That's interesting.

58
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,835
What, uh, what sort of disease is this?

59
00:06:56,918 --> 00:07:01,131
I don't know. There are conditions
like vitiligo which attack melanocytes...

60
00:07:01,214 --> 00:07:03,967
...and prevent the manufacture
of melanin in the skin...

61
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:06,595
...autoimmune disorders, not yet understood.

62
00:07:06,678 --> 00:07:08,972
So this man died of a disorder?

63
00:07:09,055 --> 00:07:11,975
He and four other young black men
contracted the disease...

64
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:15,437
...and then disappeared
without any explanation whatsoever.

65
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,649
It's possible they've already turned up,
but because of the depigmentation...

66
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:21,943
...there may be a problem with identification.

67
00:07:22,027 --> 00:07:25,780
So I have reissued descriptions
of John Does to area morgues and ERs.

68
00:07:25,864 --> 00:07:30,118
Scully, has it occurred to you
that this mightjust be a PR exercise?

69
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:30,994
I'm sorry?

70
00:07:31,077 --> 00:07:35,790
To divert attention from the fact that young
black men are dying and there's no suspect?

71
00:07:35,874 --> 00:07:40,170
- The perception being that nobody cares.
- Not everything is a conspiracy...

72
00:07:40,253 --> 00:07:45,050
...and not everybody is plotting
to deceive, inveigle and obfuscate.

73
00:07:46,676 --> 00:07:48,762
Did you lift any forensic evidence?

74
00:07:48,845 --> 00:07:52,432
Yes. Hair, skin and fibre.
Behind you on the counter.

75
00:07:57,646 --> 00:07:58,772
What are you doing?

76
00:07:58,855 --> 00:08:04,069
I'm gonna join the snipe hunt, if you
don't mind. Before the body count rises.

77
00:08:13,328 --> 00:08:15,038
<i>(knocking)</i>

78
00:08:16,915 --> 00:08:18,917
(man) Mr Aboah?

79
00:08:27,592 --> 00:08:29,761
Anyone home?

80
00:08:37,060 --> 00:08:39,062
Samuel Aboah?

81
00:08:40,188 --> 00:08:41,481
Yes.

82
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:45,235
I'm Marcus Duff. Remember me?

83
00:08:46,319 --> 00:08:48,154
Your immigration counsellor.

84
00:08:48,238 --> 00:08:52,617
We have an appointment
to go over your naturalisation petition.

85
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:54,327
Um, please.

86
00:08:54,411 --> 00:08:56,329
Thank you.

87
00:09:10,677 --> 00:09:14,139
We could use a little light
to fill out the petition.

88
00:09:14,222 --> 00:09:17,225
Maybe you can open a window or something.

89
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:30,989
Yeah... I guess that works.

90
00:09:31,573 --> 00:09:34,993
Have a seat, Samuel.
This is a little complicated.

91
00:09:39,372 --> 00:09:41,374
So...

92
00:09:43,418 --> 00:09:45,628
You OK? You look ill.

93
00:09:45,712 --> 00:09:48,131
You got a fever or something?

94
00:09:49,632 --> 00:09:50,675
No.

95
00:09:53,553 --> 00:09:57,348
I know how lonely it is, believe me.

96
00:09:58,266 --> 00:10:01,770
Being in a strange place
far from your family.

97
00:10:01,853 --> 00:10:05,857
But once you become a US citizen...

98
00:10:06,566 --> 00:10:11,154
...I can help you bring over
every brother, sister...

99
00:10:11,237 --> 00:10:13,323
...aunt, uncle and cousin.

100
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:18,495
It all starts today, Samuel.

101
00:10:19,037 --> 00:10:21,748
Know what I'm saying?

102
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:25,710
Thank you.

103
00:10:30,507 --> 00:10:35,553
Agent Pendrell. Thanks for turning this
materials analysis around on short notice.

104
00:10:35,637 --> 00:10:38,223
Shouldn't we wait for Agent Scully?

105
00:10:38,306 --> 00:10:40,225
- She's not coming.
- Why not?

106
00:10:40,308 --> 00:10:42,727
She had a date.

107
00:10:42,811 --> 00:10:45,897
Breathe! It's with a dead man.
She's doing an autopsy.

108
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,610
- You said you found something?
- Yeah. Asbestos fibres. Not much there.

109
00:10:50,693 --> 00:10:56,157
And I didn't think there was anything among
the vegetable debris - local soils, pollens, etc.

110
00:10:56,241 --> 00:10:58,451
Till I came across this.

111
00:10:58,701 --> 00:11:03,414
I had to go on-line with a botanist
at UVN to determine what it was.

112
00:11:03,498 --> 00:11:05,458
It looks like some kind of thorn.

113
00:11:05,542 --> 00:11:10,296
No, it's a seed, actually. But nothing
you'll find at your local nursery.

114
00:11:12,298 --> 00:11:14,843
<i>Adenia volkensii.</i>

115
00:11:15,593 --> 00:11:18,471
- Help me out.
- From a rare species of passionflower.

116
00:11:18,555 --> 00:11:23,601
It's a rare, night-blooming plant indigenous
only to certain parts of West Africa.

117
00:11:25,687 --> 00:11:30,900
How could this travel 5,000 miles around
the world and wind up on Owen Sanders?

118
00:11:30,984 --> 00:11:32,902
That I couldn't tell you.

119
00:11:32,986 --> 00:11:36,364
It contains a cerebropathic glycoside.
Mean anything to you?

120
00:11:36,447 --> 00:11:40,952
<i>If I'm correct, it's a cortical depressant that
works on the higher centres of the brain.</i>

121
00:11:41,035 --> 00:11:43,788
- Is it lethal?
- In large enough quantities it might be.

122
00:11:43,872 --> 00:11:46,624
Larger than anything
contained in a single seed.

123
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:50,587
Did the toxicology screen
detect any of it in Sanders' blood?

124
00:11:50,670 --> 00:11:53,631
<i>No, the tox screen was clean.</i>

125
00:11:53,715 --> 00:11:55,842
Could his body have metabolised it?

126
00:11:57,468 --> 00:12:00,638
Only if the victim hadn't expired immediately.

127
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:05,435
- Does that tell you anything about anything?
- No, but...

128
00:12:05,685 --> 00:12:09,731
...I think I found something
that could explain the depigmentation.

129
00:12:09,814 --> 00:12:13,985
- <i>His pituitary</i> gland <i>was necrotised.</i>
- <i>His pituitary gland?</i>

130
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:17,697
The pituitary gland secretes all of the
regulatory hormones in the body...

131
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,909
...and it controls the production
of melanin in the skin cells.

132
00:12:20,992 --> 00:12:23,411
So you found evidence
that this <i>is</i> a disease?

133
00:12:23,494 --> 00:12:28,416
No. I have identified the effect.
I am still looking for the cause.

134
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:31,252
OK, let me know
as soon as you find anything out.

135
00:12:31,336 --> 00:12:36,132
- Where are you, Mulder?
- Off to water the seeds of doubt. Bye-bye.

136
00:13:12,669 --> 00:13:14,671
Ms Covarrubias?

137
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:20,343
- Who are you?
- Agent Mulder. Fox Mulder.

138
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:23,805
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry I frightened you.

139
00:13:23,888 --> 00:13:25,181
What do you want?

140
00:13:25,264 --> 00:13:29,018
I'm not sure why, but I thought
you might be in a position to help me.

141
00:13:29,102 --> 00:13:30,603
Help you?

142
00:13:30,687 --> 00:13:35,191
Four young men are missing in Philadelphia.
One of the men was found dead last night.

143
00:13:35,274 --> 00:13:37,652
This seed was recovered from his body.

144
00:13:37,735 --> 00:13:42,073
It's from a rare species of plant
found only in West Africa.

145
00:13:42,156 --> 00:13:45,118
Do you know anything about this case?

146
00:13:45,201 --> 00:13:46,160
No.

147
00:13:46,244 --> 00:13:50,248
Is there any way you could find
something out about it?

148
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:56,295
Thousands of exotic species
cross into US soil every day undetected.

149
00:13:57,088 --> 00:14:01,426
Bilge water is emptied into harbours,
produce sent through the mail.

150
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:06,264
In practical terms,
borders are little more than lines on maps.

151
00:14:07,306 --> 00:14:09,308
Is that a yes or a no?

152
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:13,312
- I can't help you.
- You can't or you won't?

153
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,774
You made an overture to me.
You left an opening.

154
00:14:16,858 --> 00:14:21,446
Tell me I'm wrong. Tell me there's
nothing here, and I'll just walk away.

155
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:23,781
Either way, I need to know.

156
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:48,473
Agh!

157
00:15:29,013 --> 00:15:30,973
<i>(distorted) Hey,</i> I <i>got</i> a <i>schedule.</i>

158
00:15:34,977 --> 00:15:36,896
You gettin' on or not?

159
00:15:39,065 --> 00:15:42,068
What's your problem?
You on drugs or something?

160
00:15:42,902 --> 00:15:46,823
Ah, the hell with you.
You can walk for all I care.

161
00:15:46,906 --> 00:15:48,866
Damned drugs.

162
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:16,811
He was sitting right here, staring at me
with these glassy eyes. Pretty much out of it.

163
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:18,980
You mean he looked sick?

164
00:16:19,063 --> 00:16:21,107
Yeah, now that you mention it.

165
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:25,027
I mean, I asked him if he needed help,
but he didn't say squat.

166
00:16:25,319 --> 00:16:28,614
Don't forget to put down
I had a schedule to keep.

167
00:16:28,698 --> 00:16:31,200
Did you observe anybody else in the area?

168
00:16:31,284 --> 00:16:35,705
Not that I saw. I already told the police
pretty much everything I know.

169
00:16:35,788 --> 00:16:38,124
<i>- (car approaches)
- Excuse me.</i>

170
00:16:40,209 --> 00:16:42,879
- What happened?
- We have another missing young man.

171
00:16:42,962 --> 00:16:48,301
Alfred Kittel, 17 years old, African-American.
His mother called the police around 3am.

172
00:16:48,384 --> 00:16:51,721
- How does she know he's missing?
- He works down the street.

173
00:16:51,804 --> 00:16:55,099
He takes this bus every night,
and last night he never made it home.

174
00:16:55,183 --> 00:16:57,852
They found his knapsack on the bench here.

175
00:16:57,935 --> 00:17:00,313
The police are out canvassing.

176
00:17:00,396 --> 00:17:05,067
I talked to a bus driver who said that
he seemed disoriented, nonresponsive.

177
00:17:05,151 --> 00:17:08,446
It might be some kind of
pre-symptomatic dementia.

178
00:17:08,696 --> 00:17:11,657
Or a reaction
to a powerful cortical depressant.

179
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:13,326
What are you suggesting?

180
00:17:13,409 --> 00:17:17,538
Find Alfred Kittel and you find
another one of those rare African seeds.

181
00:17:17,622 --> 00:17:18,873
What makes you so sure?

182
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:22,168
A week before the first person
was reported missing...

183
00:17:22,251 --> 00:17:25,588
...the New York Port Authority
filed that with the FAA.

184
00:17:25,671 --> 00:17:28,174
Like Owen Sanders,
this man wasn't an albino either.

185
00:17:28,257 --> 00:17:32,887
Not until he was found dead on a charter
flight from West Africa, from Burkina Faso.

186
00:17:33,095 --> 00:17:37,225
The embassy demanded the body's return
before an autopsy could be performed.

187
00:17:37,308 --> 00:17:39,769
It says cause of death was undetermined.

188
00:17:39,852 --> 00:17:43,856
Yeah, undetermined, Scully,
but not necessarily unknown.

189
00:17:54,116 --> 00:17:57,286
"Aboah"?
What the hell kind of name is that?

190
00:18:05,169 --> 00:18:06,462
Mr Aboah?

191
00:18:07,755 --> 00:18:10,675
- Yes.
- Philadelphia PD.

192
00:18:10,758 --> 00:18:14,178
We're canvassing the building
in regard to a missing person.

193
00:18:14,262 --> 00:18:18,474
This is the young man we're looking for.
Have you seen him?

194
00:18:20,685 --> 00:18:21,811
No.

195
00:18:21,894 --> 00:18:26,232
Well, if you hear from anyone who has,
or come across any information at all...

196
00:18:26,315 --> 00:18:31,320
...you can reach us at this number.
That's a hot line. You can call 24 hours a day.

197
00:18:31,612 --> 00:18:34,031
<i>(laboured breathing)</i>

198
00:18:36,158 --> 00:18:37,952
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

199
00:19:21,746 --> 00:19:25,750
- I am really quite busy.
- We won't take up much of your time.

200
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:28,878
You're in charge of most of the casework...

201
00:19:28,961 --> 00:19:31,672
...for aliens immigrating
from Africa and the Caribbean?

202
00:19:31,756 --> 00:19:35,676
I assist people from that part of the world
where I came from 15 years ago.

203
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:40,723
We're looking for somebody that came
more recently. On a flight from Burkina Faso.

204
00:19:40,806 --> 00:19:44,894
This is the passenger manifest
from the charter company.

205
00:19:44,977 --> 00:19:48,147
And... you want me to do what, exactly?

206
00:19:48,314 --> 00:19:52,485
Cross-reference the names with anyone
applying for permanent resident status...

207
00:19:52,568 --> 00:19:54,779
...or a work visa in the last three months.

208
00:19:54,862 --> 00:20:00,201
I am a social worker, not a police officer.
My business is not chasing down illegals.

209
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:02,370
Sir, we're not here to arrest anybody.

210
00:20:02,453 --> 00:20:05,831
But you are FBI agents, are you not?

211
00:20:05,915 --> 00:20:09,418
Yes. Investigating
a possible public health crisis.

212
00:20:14,048 --> 00:20:16,342
What kind of crisis?

213
00:20:31,982 --> 00:20:35,194
He's not at home.
We might as well get comfortable.

214
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:41,325
It has to be here, Mulder. There has to be
some evidence of a virus or bacterium.

215
00:20:42,034 --> 00:20:46,372
If you looked up from the microscope,
you'd see that what's missing is a motive.

216
00:20:46,455 --> 00:20:49,875
The motive of any pathogen
is to reproduce itself.

217
00:20:49,959 --> 00:20:53,671
My job as a doctor is to find out
<i>if</i> and how it is being transmitted.

218
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:57,758
- If this is a health crisis.
- Death is a health crisis.

219
00:20:57,842 --> 00:21:00,386
Something caused Sanders' pituitary to fail...

220
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:06,183
...which caused his metabolism to drop,
resulting in coma and, finally, in death.

221
00:21:06,934 --> 00:21:09,770
Sometimes you have to start at the end
to find the beginning.

222
00:21:09,854 --> 00:21:13,691
I just hope we don't have to find
another dead body to discover what that is.

223
00:21:13,774 --> 00:21:15,860
Maybe we won't have to wait.

224
00:21:19,196 --> 00:21:22,199
Mr Aboah? Can I talk to you a minute?

225
00:21:36,464 --> 00:21:39,467
- Boy, this guy can move.
- He's not here.

226
00:21:40,134 --> 00:21:42,136
He has to be.

227
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:06,535
Mulder, I think I know where he went.

228
00:22:16,754 --> 00:22:19,840
Come on, Mulder. Let's go. We've lost him.

229
00:22:30,976 --> 00:22:33,979
Hey, Scully, look at this.

230
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:40,694
Oh, my God.

231
00:23:20,401 --> 00:23:22,987
From outward signs,
this man is asymptomatic.

232
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:27,449
I appreciate the connection you've tried
to make, but it's a dead end.

233
00:23:28,492 --> 00:23:33,581
With your permission, I'd like to examine
him more. I'd like to run a suppression test,..

234
00:23:33,664 --> 00:23:37,167
...do a TSH screen, take a history.

235
00:23:37,251 --> 00:23:39,670
It would help if we could talk to him.

236
00:23:40,004 --> 00:23:42,339
I'm working on that.

237
00:23:47,011 --> 00:23:48,679
- Nothing?
- Not yet.

238
00:23:48,804 --> 00:23:51,932
That doesn't mean he isn't a carrier,
or even the index case.

239
00:23:52,016 --> 00:23:54,935
He's some kind of case, the way
he disappeared down that drainpipe.

240
00:23:55,019 --> 00:23:58,522
Why has Samuel Aboah been arrested?

241
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:03,485
You said his health was in danger.
Why have I been lied to?

242
00:24:03,861 --> 00:24:05,779
Nobody has lied to you, sir.

243
00:24:05,863 --> 00:24:08,532
Then, please, release him immediately.

244
00:24:08,657 --> 00:24:10,618
We would like to do some more tests.

245
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:14,872
We have to be sure his health hasn't been
endangered and he isn't endangering others.

246
00:24:14,997 --> 00:24:18,042
- Then why have you called me?
- As a translator.

247
00:24:18,167 --> 00:24:20,878
We'd like to be able
to ask him some questions.

248
00:24:20,961 --> 00:24:23,380
- About what?
- About Alfred Kittel...

249
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:28,636
...and several other men who've gone missing
since his arrival in Philadelphia.

250
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:33,057
- Then this <i>is</i> about a criminal charge.
- There are no charges against Mr Aboah.

251
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:37,144
We arrested him because he ran when
we tried to question him. I wanna know why.

252
00:24:37,227 --> 00:24:41,649
Sir, if you had ever been beaten
by the police...

253
00:24:42,232 --> 00:24:45,819
...or had your home burned
for no other reason than being born...

254
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:49,406
...then, maybe,
you would understand why he ran.

255
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:51,241
And why you would run too.

256
00:24:52,326 --> 00:24:56,497
He ran because he's hiding something.
And no amount of tests you run on him...

257
00:24:56,580 --> 00:25:00,000
- ...no science is gonna find that. Excuse me.
- Where are you going?

258
00:25:00,084 --> 00:25:04,838
To find someone who I know plotted
to deceive, inveigle and obfuscate.

259
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,687
Minister, this is Agent Mulder with the FBI.

260
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:24,942
- Thank you for seeing me at such a late hour.
- I did not have much choice in this matter.

261
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:29,780
Someone from the United Nations
spoke to the ambassador.

262
00:25:31,448 --> 00:25:33,575
What's so important that it can't wait?

263
00:25:33,742 --> 00:25:36,453
With all due respect, sir,
I think you already know.

264
00:25:36,954 --> 00:25:38,706
<i>Do I'.></i>

265
00:25:38,789 --> 00:25:42,459
Something happened on a flight
from your country three months ago.

266
00:25:42,543 --> 00:25:46,880
Something that you felt compelled to hide,
even from your own ambassador.

267
00:25:46,964 --> 00:25:51,468
The request to stop investigating
this man's death came from you.

268
00:25:55,222 --> 00:26:00,894
I understand the need to protect your
diplomatic position, but more men are dying.

269
00:26:05,232 --> 00:26:07,943
Even if I tell you what I know...

270
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,905
...you would never believe it.

271
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:14,658
You'd be surprised at what I believe, sir.

272
00:26:17,161 --> 00:26:19,830
I had hoped, if I closed my eyes...

273
00:26:20,164 --> 00:26:23,000
...it would go away this time.

274
00:26:23,125 --> 00:26:25,127
This time?

275
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:28,505
My people...

276
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:33,343
...the Bambara, are farmers.

277
00:26:34,094 --> 00:26:36,930
I grew up hearing the old stories...

278
00:26:38,015 --> 00:26:41,643
...believing them as only a child can believe.

279
00:26:42,186 --> 00:26:44,605
What kinds of stories?

280
00:26:46,523 --> 00:26:48,525
The Teliko.

281
00:26:50,778 --> 00:26:52,780
Spirits...

282
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:55,532
...of the air.

283
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:59,953
<i>It was said they rested by day...</i>

284
00:27:00,037 --> 00:27:02,372
<i>...in closed, dark places...</i>

285
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:05,209
<i>...deep inside tree hollows...</i>

286
00:27:05,334 --> 00:27:08,045
<i>...and in holes beneath the ground...</i>

287
00:27:08,337 --> 00:27:12,382
<i>...too small even for a child to hide himself.</i>

288
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:14,885
Mr Aboah?

289
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,723
<i>Only when the sun fell...</i>

290
00:27:19,807 --> 00:27:22,976
<i>...when the rest of the world was sleeping...</i>

291
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:25,229
<i>...would they come out.</i>

292
00:27:25,896 --> 00:27:28,482
Come out to do what, sir?

293
00:27:29,399 --> 00:27:31,860
I was seven years old.

294
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:34,863
Lying awake one night, I saw him.

295
00:27:36,865 --> 00:27:39,076
He was standing over me.

296
00:27:39,701 --> 00:27:42,412
His hair was like straw...

297
00:27:42,496 --> 00:27:45,249
...his eyes like water...

298
00:27:45,916 --> 00:27:48,544
...staring down at me.

299
00:27:48,752 --> 00:27:52,214
I closed my eyes and screamed...

300
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:56,260
...and felt myself being swept up into the air.

301
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:02,224
But when I opened my eyes...

302
00:28:02,850 --> 00:28:04,852
...I saw my father...

303
00:28:04,935 --> 00:28:06,687
...holding me.

304
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:10,357
- Then it was a nightmare.
- That's what my father said.

305
00:28:10,607 --> 00:28:12,734
And I believed him.

306
00:28:13,277 --> 00:28:15,529
Until the next day...

307
00:28:16,446 --> 00:28:18,782
...when they found my cousin...

308
00:28:18,866 --> 00:28:21,201
...dead among his cattle.

309
00:28:24,913 --> 00:28:28,125
Looking exactly like this man.

310
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,051
Which is why...

311
00:28:38,135 --> 00:28:42,431
<i>...when this photograph
came across my desk three months ago...</i>

312
00:28:43,807 --> 00:28:48,478
<i>...I knew the Teliko
was more than just a children's story.</i>

313
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:51,106
<i>I knew it was real.</i>

314
00:28:52,941 --> 00:28:55,152
<i>I knew he was here!</i>

315
00:29:05,996 --> 00:29:10,334
This patient has something in his throat,
some kind of aberrant bone growth...

316
00:29:10,459 --> 00:29:13,587
...or maybe something foreign
lodged in his oesophagus.

317
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:16,173
Hm. Could be a lot of things.

318
00:29:16,632 --> 00:29:21,261
You'd be amazed what I've seen
removed from people's throats in ERs.

319
00:29:21,345 --> 00:29:23,180
That's only part of it.

320
00:29:23,263 --> 00:29:28,101
I discovered something even more disturbing
when his PET series came back.

321
00:29:29,144 --> 00:29:33,857
Look right here on the sagittal section,
right below the hypothalamus.

322
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:37,945
- There must be some mistake.
- There's no mistake.

323
00:29:38,028 --> 00:29:40,822
This patient has no pituitary gland.

324
00:29:41,657 --> 00:29:42,783
That's not possible.

325
00:29:42,866 --> 00:29:46,703
I can't even begin to explain
what we're seeing here, sir.

326
00:29:46,787 --> 00:29:49,623
I just hope this patient
can provide some answers.

327
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:52,292
You'll have to find him first.

328
00:29:52,376 --> 00:29:55,462
- What are you talking about?
- I was looking for you in Quarantine.

329
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:58,215
Samuel Aboah is gone, disappeared.

330
00:30:28,704 --> 00:30:30,080
<i>(gasps)</i>

331
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:33,834
Samuel?

332
00:30:36,378 --> 00:30:38,380
You scared me.

333
00:30:42,092 --> 00:30:44,761
They let you out of the hospital?

334
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:46,430
Yes.

335
00:30:47,431 --> 00:30:49,766
Everything is fine?

336
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,685
Samuel?

337
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:55,063
Did you want to see me about something?

338
00:30:57,941 --> 00:31:02,696
Well, come on. Let me give you a ride home.
We can talk about it on the way.

339
00:31:03,113 --> 00:31:06,199
Lucky for you I was working late.

340
00:31:06,283 --> 00:31:08,368
Yes. Lucky.

341
00:31:08,618 --> 00:31:10,620
Come, let's go.

342
00:31:22,883 --> 00:31:25,260
<i>(Scully)</i> When did this happen?

343
00:31:26,553 --> 00:31:29,556
Thank you, Lieutenant. I appreciate it.

344
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:33,977
I think this was his getaway vehicle.

345
00:31:34,311 --> 00:31:37,147
He didn't even touch his Jell-O.

346
00:31:37,272 --> 00:31:40,817
Let's go. Marcus Duff's car
turned up abandoned...

347
00:31:40,901 --> 00:31:44,446
...with the keys in the ignition
and the hood still hot.

348
00:32:23,276 --> 00:32:28,532
6834, requesting ambulance
in alley behind 1163 West Cherry.

349
00:32:28,657 --> 00:32:31,868
Man down.
Victim: African-American male, aged 35...

350
00:32:35,288 --> 00:32:39,543
- Do you know what happened to him?
- I won't even try to guess, but he's alive.

351
00:32:39,668 --> 00:32:42,379
What about Aboah?
Any indication of where he might be?

352
00:32:42,462 --> 00:32:45,882
We're still sweeping the area.
I'll keep you posted.

353
00:32:46,133 --> 00:32:48,969
He's gotta be around here.
He can't have gotten far.

354
00:32:49,052 --> 00:32:51,972
He can squeeze into a coffee can.
He could be anywhere.

355
00:32:52,055 --> 00:32:54,558
- They'll find him.
- They'll find another victim.

356
00:32:54,641 --> 00:32:58,562
- We interrupted him before he could finish.
- Interrupted his killing Duff?

357
00:32:58,645 --> 00:33:02,899
The killing is just incidental, I think,
to a far more basic need.

358
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:04,234
What need?

359
00:33:04,317 --> 00:33:09,322
If Aboah has no pituitary, then his body
couldn't produce melanin itself, right?

360
00:33:09,406 --> 00:33:10,824
Theoretically, yes.

361
00:33:10,907 --> 00:33:14,995
Well, when you examined him
you didn't observe one single albino trait.

362
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:19,583
Considering his PET scan results, I don't
even know how he managed to stay alive.

363
00:33:19,666 --> 00:33:22,836
That's what I'm talking about: survival.
And not just Aboah's.

364
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:28,008
I think the anomaly you observed is not just
physiological. I think it may be evolutionary.

365
00:33:28,091 --> 00:33:32,596
- What are you talking about?
- A lost tribe, a clan of sub-Saharan albinos...

366
00:33:32,679 --> 00:33:37,184
...linked by a common congenital deficit,
who've adapted over generations by...

367
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:42,105
- By stealing other people's hormones?
- Somehow, Aboah has managed to survive.

368
00:33:45,025 --> 00:33:49,863
However he's managed to survive, what
makes you think he's not an isolated case?

369
00:33:49,946 --> 00:33:53,408
Because of something
somebody told me last night.

370
00:33:56,036 --> 00:33:58,038
An African folk tale.

371
00:33:58,413 --> 00:34:00,457
You're basing this theory on a folk tale?

372
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,043
It's just another way
of describing the same truth.

373
00:34:03,126 --> 00:34:07,047
All new truths begin as heresies and end
as superstitions. We fear the unknown...

374
00:34:07,130 --> 00:34:13,094
...so we reduce it to terms that are familiar,
whether that's a folk tale or a disease or...

375
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:15,597
...a conspiracy.

376
00:34:18,266 --> 00:34:21,811
Even if you're right,
<i>especially</i> if you're right...

377
00:34:21,895 --> 00:34:24,147
...why would he leave his country
to come here?

378
00:34:24,272 --> 00:34:25,899
Free cable.

379
00:34:26,441 --> 00:34:28,568
The same reasons anybody comes here.

380
00:34:28,652 --> 00:34:31,738
Liberty, the freedom
to pursue your own interests...

381
00:34:32,447 --> 00:34:34,407
Look at that.

382
00:34:34,491 --> 00:34:37,077
- What are you doing?
- It's a demolition site.

383
00:34:38,245 --> 00:34:40,455
Why are we here, Mulder?

384
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:44,334
Pendrell found asbestos fibres
on Owen Sanders' body.

385
00:34:44,459 --> 00:34:48,588
You remove asbestos from an old building
before you tear it down.

386
00:34:50,006 --> 00:34:52,509
It had to come from somewhere.

387
00:35:32,007 --> 00:35:33,216
<i>(slang)</i>

388
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:01,411
Agh!

00:36:13,923 --> 00:36:15,258

390
00:36:18,678 --> 00:36:20,055

392
00:36:34,027 --> 00:36:35,278
Mulder?

393
00:36:40,742 --> 00:36:42,035
Mulder?

394
00:37:05,767 --> 00:37:07,102
Mulder?

00:37:38,758 --> 00:37:40,093

397
00:38:59,047 --> 00:39:00,423
Mulder!

398
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:09,516
Mulder, are you OK?

399
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:12,101

403
00:39:45,635 --> 00:39:49,305
It's OK, Mulder. I'm here. OK?

404
00:40:24,757 --> 00:40:26,759
Sorry, Mulder.

405
00:40:33,516 --> 00:40:34,851
<i>(groans)</i>

406
00:40:42,442 --> 00:40:43,526
<i>911. Operator.</i>

407
00:40:43,610 --> 00:40:48,948
This is Agent Dana Scully, FBI, requesting
immediate EMS and police assistance.

408
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:52,952
- I'm in Liberty Plaza.
- May <i>I</i> have your <i>badge</i> number?

409
00:40:53,328 --> 00:40:55,371
My badge number?

410
00:40:55,455 --> 00:40:58,166
JTT0331613.

413
00:41:05,173 --> 00:41:06,299
No.

<i>(groans weakly)</i>

415
00:41:07,884 --> 00:41:12,013
Liberty Plaza. There's a demolition site
on the north side of the street.

416
00:41:41,084 --> 00:41:45,588
<i>Special Agent Dana Scully,
field journal entry number 74.</i>

417
00:41:46,673 --> 00:41:49,592
<i>Despite acute trauma to his pituitary gland...</i>

418
00:41:49,676 --> 00:41:54,847
<i>...Marcus Duff was discharged early this
morning from Mount Zion Medical Center.</i>

419
00:41:55,431 --> 00:42:01,020
<i>He is expected to testify before a grand jury
in the capital case against Samuel Aboah...</i>

420
00:42:01,104 --> 00:42:04,440
<i>...who is being charged
with five counts of murder.</i>

421
00:42:05,108 --> 00:42:07,360
<i>It remains uncertain, however...</i>

422
00:42:07,443 --> 00:42:10,780
<i>...whether Aboah will live
long enough to stand trial.</i>

423
00:42:10,863 --> 00:42:14,033
<i>His response to hormone therapy
has been poor...</i>

424
00:42:14,117 --> 00:42:17,078
<i>...his deterioration progressive.</i>

425
00:42:17,453 --> 00:42:19,706
<i>My conviction remains intact:</i>

426
00:42:19,789 --> 00:42:23,793
<i>...that the mechanism by which
Aboah killed and, in turn, survived...</i>

427
00:42:23,876 --> 00:42:26,713
<i>...can only be explained by medical science.</i>

428
00:42:26,796 --> 00:42:32,635
<i>And that science will eventually discover
his place in the broader context of evolution.</i>

429
00:42:33,553 --> 00:42:36,556
<i>But what science
may never be able to explain...</i>

430
00:42:36,639 --> 00:42:40,059
<i>...is our ineffable fear of the alien among us.</i>

431
00:42:40,435 --> 00:42:44,647
<i>A fear which often drives us
not to search for understanding...</i>

432
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:48,151
<i>...but to deceive, inveigle and obfuscate.</i>

433
00:42:49,068 --> 00:42:52,572
<i>To obscure the truth, not only from others...</i>

434
00:42:52,655 --> 00:42:54,657
<i>...but from ourselves.</i>
