00:00:04,256 --> 00:00:05,257
<i>(gavel banging)</i>

2
00:00:05,591 --> 00:00:08,886
(man) Will the witness
please rise and take the oath?

3
00:00:11,597 --> 00:00:16,351
I, Dana Katherine Scully,
swear to tell the truth, the whole truth...

4
00:00:16,435 --> 00:00:19,062
...and nothing but the truth, so help me God.

5
00:00:21,899 --> 00:00:25,611
- I would like to read a prepared statement.
- You may do so.

6
00:00:29,573 --> 00:00:33,869
"I left behind a career in medicine
to become an FBI agent four years ago...

7
00:00:33,952 --> 00:00:36,246
...because I believed in this country."

8
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:41,752
"I wanted to uphold its laws, to punish
the guilty and to protect the innocent."

9
00:00:41,835 --> 00:00:43,921
"I still believe in this country."

10
00:00:44,004 --> 00:00:47,507
"But I believe there are powerful men
in the government who do not."

11
00:00:47,633 --> 00:00:51,094
"Men who have no respect for the law
and who flout it with impunity."

12
00:00:51,178 --> 00:00:53,555
- Ms Scully...
- "I have come to the conclusion...

13
00:00:53,639 --> 00:00:55,933
- ...that it is no longer possible..."
- Agent Scully.

14
00:00:56,016 --> 00:00:58,477
This is not a soapbox, Ms Scully.

15
00:00:58,602 --> 00:01:01,104
Your statement
will be entered into the record.

16
00:01:01,188 --> 00:01:03,565
With respect, I would like to finish.

17
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:05,651
This is not why we are here today.

18
00:01:05,776 --> 00:01:08,070
Then, why are we here, sir?

19
00:01:08,153 --> 00:01:12,366
Agent Scully, do you or do you not know
the whereabouts of Agent Mulder?

20
00:01:13,492 --> 00:01:17,496
Are you or are you not aware
of Agent Mulder's present location?

21
00:01:19,456 --> 00:01:22,125
I decline to answer that question, sir.

22
00:01:22,209 --> 00:01:24,336
Ms Scully, you cannot refuse to answer.

23
00:01:24,419 --> 00:01:25,837
Because I believe answering that question...

24
00:01:25,963 --> 00:01:27,839
...could endanger Agent Mulder's life.

25
00:01:27,965 --> 00:01:31,510
You don't seem to understand.
Your response is not optional.

26
00:01:31,635 --> 00:01:33,512
You're an agent of the FBI.

27
00:01:33,637 --> 00:01:35,847
Then if I may finish my statement.

28
00:01:35,973 --> 00:01:40,477
"..That it is no longer possible for me
to carry out my duties as an FBI Agent."

29
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,856
Are you tendering your resignation?
Is that what you're trying to say?

30
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,734
No, sir.

31
00:01:49,069 --> 00:01:54,116
What I am saying
is that there is a culture of lawlessness...

32
00:01:54,199 --> 00:01:56,952
...that has prevented me from doing my job.

33
00:01:57,035 --> 00:01:59,830
That the real target
of this committee's investigation...

34
00:01:59,913 --> 00:02:03,375
...should be the men who are
beyond prosecution and punishment.

35
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,963
The men whose secret policies
are behind the crimes you are investigating.

36
00:02:08,046 --> 00:02:11,383
Tell us what you know
about Agent Mulder's whereabouts...

37
00:02:11,508 --> 00:02:14,594
...or you will be held
in contempt of Congress.

38
00:02:18,765 --> 00:02:20,726
(Sorenson) Agent Scully?

39
00:02:56,136 --> 00:02:58,096
Everything's in order. Have a nice day.

40
00:03:02,642 --> 00:03:05,103
- There you go, sir.
- Here, I'll get that.

41
00:03:08,106 --> 00:03:09,441
All right. Thank you.

42
00:03:25,665 --> 00:03:27,918
- Where are you coming from?
- Japan.

43
00:03:28,001 --> 00:03:31,546
- Did you travel anywhere else?
- The Republic of Georgia.

44
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:35,217
- The purpose of your trip?
- Government business.

45
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,969
I'm going to ask you
to see the customs official.

46
00:03:38,095 --> 00:03:41,264
What for? I'm travelling
on a United States diplomatic visa.

47
00:03:41,348 --> 00:03:43,975
A random check.
Please proceed through the doors.

48
00:03:44,101 --> 00:03:48,146
- I've got a connecting flight.
- Right through those doors, sir.

49
00:03:50,148 --> 00:03:51,650
Right over here, sir.

50
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:56,696
What's this about? I have diplomatic papers.
I can't be treated like this.

51
00:03:56,822 --> 00:03:58,615
Is that your only luggage, sir?

52
00:03:58,698 --> 00:04:01,118
- Yes.
- Can you open it for me?

53
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:02,369
No.

54
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:09,209
Sir, I'm not offering it as a choice.
Open the briefcase, or we'll open it for you.

55
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:12,045
I don't have the combination.

56
00:04:12,337 --> 00:04:13,797
Vince?

57
00:04:13,922 --> 00:04:17,467
I need a strip
and full-body-cavity search of this man.

58
00:04:20,679 --> 00:04:24,015
There'll be hell to pay for this treatment.

59
00:04:24,141 --> 00:04:28,603
Would you mind telling me exactly
what kind of diplomatic work you do, sir?

60
00:04:28,687 --> 00:04:31,440
And what material
you're transporting in these?

61
00:04:31,523 --> 00:04:35,152
That is... Those are filled
with biohazardous materials.

62
00:04:35,652 --> 00:04:38,780
Where's the paperwork?
Why aren't the containers marked?

63
00:04:38,864 --> 00:04:43,452
Don't open those. Whatever you do,
that material cannot be exposed...

64
00:04:45,454 --> 00:04:46,955
Listen to me!

65
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:53,879
Open this door! Somebody open this door!
Somebody!

66
00:04:57,674 --> 00:05:00,218
Somebody open this door!
Let me outta here!

67
00:05:00,302 --> 00:05:01,887
What the hell is this?

68
00:05:02,554 --> 00:05:04,473
<i>(shouts) Somebody!</i>

69
00:05:06,558 --> 00:05:10,061
Oh, my God! The door!
Please let me out of here!

70
00:05:10,562 --> 00:05:11,813
<i>(screaming)</i>

71
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,819
Oh, my God! Open the door!

72
00:05:17,903 --> 00:05:20,572
Somebody let me out of here!
Get me out now!

73
00:05:20,697 --> 00:05:22,491
Get me out of here! Let me out!

74
00:06:03,907 --> 00:06:07,035
We can't go in too soon.
Be patient. It'll happen.

75
00:06:07,118 --> 00:06:08,453
What makes you so sure?

76
00:06:08,578 --> 00:06:12,040
I've received a series of receipts
for detonation cord...

77
00:06:12,123 --> 00:06:15,210
...diesel fuel,
and 80 bags of ammonium nitrate...

78
00:06:15,293 --> 00:06:18,380
...purchased in three different states
under three different signatures.

79
00:06:18,463 --> 00:06:20,799
What makes you sure that it's here, tonight?

80
00:06:20,924 --> 00:06:25,053
Last night I got two new receipts:
one for storage space at this address...

81
00:06:25,136 --> 00:06:29,474
...and one to rent a two-ton truck,
both purchased with the same signature.

82
00:06:29,558 --> 00:06:32,060
We could be looking
at the next Oklahoma City.

83
00:06:32,143 --> 00:06:35,230
Who's leaking them?
And why leak them to you?

84
00:06:35,313 --> 00:06:36,940
We've got traffic.

85
00:07:11,349 --> 00:07:13,143
They're leaving.

86
00:07:13,685 --> 00:07:14,936
Hold.

87
00:07:56,853 --> 00:07:57,979
- Go!
- Back it up!

88
00:07:58,063 --> 00:07:59,898
- Get down!
- Drop your weapons!

89
00:08:00,899 --> 00:08:02,734
Federal agents!

90
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:08,531
Everybody down! Down on the ground!

91
00:08:11,076 --> 00:08:12,202
Back it up!

92
00:08:12,744 --> 00:08:15,538
Drop your weapons
and get down on the ground!

93
00:08:16,581 --> 00:08:17,749
Gas!

94
00:08:21,503 --> 00:08:22,712
Fire!

95
00:08:22,921 --> 00:08:25,090
Get down! Everybody get down!

96
00:08:26,383 --> 00:08:27,926
Open fire!

97
00:08:37,143 --> 00:08:38,186
<i>(tyres screeching)</i>

98
00:08:41,106 --> 00:08:42,273
<i>(SCU/ly) Mulder!</i>

99
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:52,951
<i>(gunshot)</i>

100
00:08:58,123 --> 00:08:59,708
Cover the driver's side.

101
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:08,800
Federal agent! I'm armed!
Exit the vehicle now!

102
00:09:15,223 --> 00:09:16,808
The driver's dead.

103
00:09:16,891 --> 00:09:18,309
I counted two men.

104
00:09:21,312 --> 00:09:23,314
Get out of the truck!

105
00:09:30,321 --> 00:09:32,115
Get out of the truck!

106
00:09:36,119 --> 00:09:37,746
Let me see your hands.

107
00:09:39,831 --> 00:09:41,291
Hands in the air!

108
00:09:46,337 --> 00:09:47,672
You son of a bitch.

109
00:09:54,345 --> 00:09:57,098
- <i>(Scully)</i> Mulder!
- I handed you this bust!

110
00:09:57,182 --> 00:10:01,352
- Come on, Krycek!
- Who do you think sent you those receipts?

111
00:10:27,462 --> 00:10:32,467
Most of the detonation cord was stolen
from a construction site and...

112
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:36,387
...some of the explosives
were taken from the military base.

113
00:10:36,513 --> 00:10:38,848
Security's just so lax. It's a joke.

114
00:10:42,143 --> 00:10:44,854
Most everything else was over the counter.

115
00:10:47,816 --> 00:10:49,901
Two thousand kilos of boom-boom.

116
00:10:50,819 --> 00:10:53,571
How'd you get involved with these men?

117
00:10:54,989 --> 00:10:57,659
They found me in North Dakota.

118
00:10:59,911 --> 00:11:02,664
They liberated me on a salvage hunt.

119
00:11:04,415 --> 00:11:08,336
When you go underground,
you gotta learn to live with the rats.

120
00:11:10,922 --> 00:11:13,675
I'm sure you had no trouble adapting.

121
00:11:14,592 --> 00:11:17,428
These men are pathetic revolutionaries...

122
00:11:17,512 --> 00:11:20,348
...who'll kill innocent Americans
in the name of bonehead ideologies.

123
00:11:20,431 --> 00:11:22,350
You're full of crap, Krycek.

124
00:11:22,433 --> 00:11:27,438
You're a scumsucker whose
moral dipstick's two drops short of dry.

125
00:11:27,522 --> 00:11:28,898
I love this country.

126
00:11:32,944 --> 00:11:35,864
- What do you want, Kryoek?
- Same thing you do.

127
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:40,118
To find the man who tried to kill me.

128
00:11:41,286 --> 00:11:44,956
The same man who's responsible
for your father's death.

129
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,043
Your sister's.

130
00:11:49,127 --> 00:11:51,796
You want this man brought to justice?

131
00:11:52,964 --> 00:11:55,800
You can't bring these men to justice.

132
00:11:58,303 --> 00:12:04,100
The laws of this country protect these men
under the name of national security.

133
00:12:06,144 --> 00:12:07,312
They know no law.

134
00:12:07,437 --> 00:12:11,065
Then why don't you put a bullet in his head
like you did that man out there?

135
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:14,110
These men, they fear one thing: exposure.

136
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,488
You expose... him...

137
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,617
...expose his crimes...

138
00:12:20,992 --> 00:12:24,495
...you destroy
the destroyer's ability to destroy.

139
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:27,332
The only thing
that will destroy this man is the truth.

140
00:12:27,457 --> 00:12:29,751
The truth. The truth...

141
00:12:29,834 --> 00:12:31,002
There's no truth!

142
00:12:31,252 --> 00:12:33,504
These men make it up as they go along.

143
00:12:34,464 --> 00:12:36,799
They're the engineers of the future.

144
00:12:37,425 --> 00:12:38,426
They...

145
00:12:39,135 --> 00:12:41,512
They are the real revolutionaries.

146
00:12:42,805 --> 00:12:44,682
I can get them for you too.

147
00:12:47,602 --> 00:12:49,771
We can't help you, Krycek.

148
00:12:50,313 --> 00:12:51,314
Mulder...

149
00:12:54,192 --> 00:12:56,945
...this is just one bomb I'm sitting on here.

150
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:01,324
You didn't ask me
how many more I know about.

151
00:13:06,871 --> 00:13:08,623
<i>(PA) Your attention, please.</i>

152
00:13:08,706 --> 00:13:10,792
<i>Due to adverse weather conditions...</i>

153
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:14,879
<i>...Trans Con flight 78 from Buenos Aires
has been delayed.</i>

154
00:13:15,004 --> 00:13:19,884
<i>Please check the on-screen monitors
in the terminal for a new arrival time.</i>

155
00:13:23,054 --> 00:13:24,305
What flight is he on?

156
00:13:24,389 --> 00:13:27,558
An international charter
that originated in Russia.

157
00:13:27,684 --> 00:13:30,979
- A Turkish airline.
- (Mulder) There it is, Air Lacayo.

158
00:13:31,062 --> 00:13:32,647
Got in at 6:45.

159
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:35,233
That's 15 minutes ago. Come on, let's go.

160
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,486
- He still has to go through customs.
- No.

161
00:13:38,903 --> 00:13:41,239
He'll be carrying a diplomatic pouch.

162
00:13:55,545 --> 00:13:56,587
That's him.

163
00:14:04,929 --> 00:14:06,014
Sir?

164
00:14:06,222 --> 00:14:09,600
Federal agents. Don't be alarmed.
We just need to speak with you.

165
00:14:09,726 --> 00:14:11,102
Stop right there!

166
00:14:11,227 --> 00:14:12,270
Sir!

167
00:14:12,937 --> 00:14:14,022
Mulder!

168
00:15:00,485 --> 00:15:01,652
Mulder, look.

169
00:15:16,334 --> 00:15:18,836
- Is this some kind of joke?
- What?

170
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:20,129
Show him.

171
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,343
- What is it?
- Expose it for him, Scully.

172
00:15:31,099 --> 00:15:33,976
What did you get for Halloween,
Charlie Brown?

<i>(knocking)</i>

174
00:15:52,787 --> 00:15:55,665
- Who is it?
- (Mulder) I need to speak with you, sir.

175
00:15:55,748 --> 00:15:56,749
<i>(sighs)</i>

176
00:16:00,586 --> 00:16:01,629
What do you want?

177
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:04,090
Your authorisation to provide a safe house.

178
00:16:04,215 --> 00:16:05,383
A safe house for whom?

179
00:16:07,218 --> 00:16:11,639
This man has information that could
save the lives of innocent Americans.

180
00:16:14,559 --> 00:16:15,768
He'll be safe here.

181
00:16:22,233 --> 00:16:23,401
<i>(groans)</i>

182
00:16:24,235 --> 00:16:25,987
Relatively safe.

183
00:16:26,070 --> 00:16:28,573
We're not even yet, boy. That's a start.

184
00:16:29,282 --> 00:16:30,908
Give me the keys.

185
00:16:44,589 --> 00:16:47,925
You can't leave me out here!
I'm gonna freeze to death!

186
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:52,430
Just think warm thoughts.

187
00:17:11,616 --> 00:17:16,287
I know I asked you earlier. You have
absolutely no idea where this came from?

188
00:17:16,370 --> 00:17:17,788
Not its origin, no.

189
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:20,541
But you have an idea, don't you?

190
00:17:21,042 --> 00:17:25,213
This rock contains
polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons...

191
00:17:25,296 --> 00:17:28,466
...fitting the description
of those in fragments of meteorite...

192
00:17:28,549 --> 00:17:31,552
...found recently
in the ice fields of Antarctica.

193
00:17:33,012 --> 00:17:34,263
Are you saying...

194
00:17:34,347 --> 00:17:37,975
That what you're looking at
is quite possibly from Mars.

195
00:17:38,643 --> 00:17:40,353
Over four billion years old.

196
00:17:43,689 --> 00:17:45,608
Is it valuable?

197
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:50,696
Beyond adding evidence to the debate
over fossilised remains of alien bacteria...

198
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:52,073
...it's relatively worthless.

199
00:17:52,156 --> 00:17:55,201
Does this rock contain
those fossilised remains, Dr Sacks?

200
00:17:55,326 --> 00:17:59,121
Well, I won't know that
until I'm able to take a core sample.

201
00:17:59,205 --> 00:18:01,707
Which I very much hope
you'll allow me to do.

202
00:18:01,832 --> 00:18:04,835
I think we'd all like to know
what's in that rock.

203
00:18:30,569 --> 00:18:32,571
I didn't realise you lived here.

204
00:18:32,697 --> 00:18:33,906
I just moved in.

205
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:38,369
- I'd guess you live in an upper floor?
- What do you want from me?

206
00:18:40,371 --> 00:18:45,710
Mulder and Scully intercepted a diplomatic
pouch here in Washington last night.

207
00:18:45,793 --> 00:18:49,588
I'm afraid it's created a problem
in foreign-policy circles.

208
00:18:49,714 --> 00:18:51,549
Quite a problem, actually.

209
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:55,303
I don't know anything
about any diplomatic pouch.

210
00:18:55,386 --> 00:18:56,470
No?

211
00:18:57,722 --> 00:19:00,224
- Nothing about the matter?
- No, I don't.

212
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:05,938
Well, I find that hard to believe,
as their supervisory agent.

213
00:19:08,441 --> 00:19:10,234
As a friend, I should advise you...

214
00:19:10,318 --> 00:19:12,737
...that withholding information
on matters of national security...

215
00:19:12,820 --> 00:19:15,448
...is punishable under laws
of treason and sedition.

216
00:19:15,573 --> 00:19:18,743
Thank you.
I'll consider myself advised...

217
00:19:18,826 --> 00:19:19,952
...as a friend.

218
00:19:20,077 --> 00:19:21,912
I need that pouch, Mr Skinner.

219
00:19:23,581 --> 00:19:27,084
And I need to know
who gave them the order to intercept it.

220
00:19:28,169 --> 00:19:30,004
I'll get back to you.

221
00:19:30,087 --> 00:19:33,257
Wars have broken out
over far less, Mr Skinner.

222
00:19:33,341 --> 00:19:34,842
Far, far less.

223
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:45,770

224
00:19:59,617 --> 00:20:00,618

226
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:38,781
Uh-huh. Thank you.

227
00:20:39,615 --> 00:20:43,244
- Got something?
- Big dead end at the State Department.

228
00:20:43,327 --> 00:20:48,499
Customs officials detained another courier
on a similar visa in Honolulu two nights ago.

229
00:20:48,582 --> 00:20:51,419
He was coming from Russian Georgia,
carrying a toxic soil sample.

230
00:20:51,502 --> 00:20:53,671
- Toxic?
- Which leads me to believe...

231
00:20:53,754 --> 00:20:58,008
...that what's in this rock are answers
beyond the existence of extraterrestrial life.

232
00:20:58,092 --> 00:21:00,344
Even beyond the conspiracy
to cover up that existence.

233
00:21:00,469 --> 00:21:04,682
Mulder, that rock contains fossils
of what is believed to be alien bacteria...

234
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:06,934
...and even that is under intense debate.

235
00:21:07,017 --> 00:21:09,103
Why all this effort to get it onto US soil?

236
00:21:09,186 --> 00:21:13,107
I think what Krycek has given us
is a pivotal piece to a larger plot.

237
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,526
What he's given us, Mulder, is a rock.

238
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:17,862
Alex Krycek is a liar and a murderer.

239
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:22,533
Who wants to expose the same men we do
and will go to any lengths to succeed.

240
00:21:24,368 --> 00:21:28,456
What I'm worried about is you, Mulder.
How far <i>you'll</i> go.

241
00:21:28,539 --> 00:21:30,332
And how far I can follow you.

242
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:44,305
<i>(whirring)</i>

243
00:22:23,552 --> 00:22:24,595

244
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,430
- <i>Yeah?</i>
- Mulder, where are you?

245
00:22:26,555 --> 00:22:28,933
I'm with Scully,
on our way out to NASA Goddard.

246
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:33,854
I suggest you head home. I don't know
how to explain myself to the police.

247
00:22:33,938 --> 00:22:35,773
<i>Explain yourself about what?</i>

248
00:22:36,232 --> 00:22:41,237
The police are at my place with a dead body.
They wanna talk to everyone in the building.

249
00:22:42,071 --> 00:22:44,365
- Pull over here.
- What are you doing?

250
00:22:44,448 --> 00:22:46,450
I'm gonna take a cab.

251
00:22:46,575 --> 00:22:50,412
I want you to find out about that rock.
Call me as soon as you do.

252
00:22:55,292 --> 00:22:57,586
(man) Shouldn't be too much longer.

253
00:23:04,468 --> 00:23:06,887
- No, I wasn't home.
- And you live on what floor?

254
00:23:06,971 --> 00:23:11,308
Seventeenth. Walter Skinner.
I'm an assistant director with the FBI.

255
00:23:11,392 --> 00:23:13,310
Oh. My apologies.

256
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:18,440
I got some bad information that
there's a man hanging from your balcony.

257
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:29,326
<i>(yells)</i>

258
00:23:33,163 --> 00:23:37,167
We'll walk out of here like nothing
happened. If anybody speaks to us...

00:23:37,293 --> 00:23:38,502
...you say nothing.

260
00:23:41,005 --> 00:23:42,172
I got no problem.

261
00:23:43,007 --> 00:23:45,926
You put me up here. I'm looking forward
to see how you get me out.

262
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:49,179
- Stupid-ass haircut!
- I got news for you, Mulder.

263
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:53,350
When they find out
who's dead down there...

264
00:23:53,434 --> 00:23:57,271
...there's gonna be no question
whose apartment he was pulled out of.

265
00:23:57,354 --> 00:23:59,773
- Who was he?
- Same guy with the pouch.

266
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:04,445
- Let's go.
- I say follow the pouch.

00:24:10,451 --> 00:24:13,370
- Yeah.
- Mulder, it's me. Listen to me.

269
00:24:13,996 --> 00:24:16,915
Whatever's in that rock,
it appears to be lethal.

270
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:18,292
<i>What is it?</i>

271
00:24:18,375 --> 00:24:19,793
Dr Sacks, he's...

272
00:24:21,378 --> 00:24:24,632
I don't know, Mulder.
I've never seen this before.

273
00:24:24,715 --> 00:24:26,884
I don't know if he's dead or alive.

274
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:30,387
<i>You'd better find out. I want you
to get me an address in New York.</i>

275
00:24:30,512 --> 00:24:32,181
Go through the Bureau to get it.

276
00:24:44,902 --> 00:24:47,237
- <i>(woman)</i> Who is it?
- Fox Mulder.

277
00:24:50,491 --> 00:24:52,409
- What are you doing here?
- I need your help.

278
00:24:52,493 --> 00:24:55,162
- How did you know where I live?
- FBI database.

279
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:58,040
I'm sorry. It's a matter of extreme urgency.

280
00:24:59,041 --> 00:25:03,754
A diplomatic pouch left Russia and
arrived here in the US. Two men are dead.

281
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:05,214
I need to know why.

282
00:25:24,525 --> 00:25:27,444
(Covarrubias) Do you have its destination?

283
00:25:28,028 --> 00:25:29,613
And its routing entries?

284
00:25:30,572 --> 00:25:32,616
- Thank <i>you.</i>
<i>- (hangs up phone)</i>

285
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:49,216
Agent Mulder?

286
00:25:54,763 --> 00:26:00,060
The diplomatic pouch travelled an APEX
route to the Russian province, Krasnoyarsk.

287
00:26:00,144 --> 00:26:03,647
- Krasnoyarsk?
- Port of entry was the city of Norilsk.

288
00:26:04,231 --> 00:26:06,483
That's just north of Tunguska.

289
00:26:06,608 --> 00:26:08,485
- Tunguska?
- Yeah.

290
00:26:12,322 --> 00:26:13,991
- What are you looking for?
- My cell phone.

291
00:26:14,074 --> 00:26:17,494
I'm gonna book myself
on a flight to Krasnoyarsk, Russia.

292
00:26:17,911 --> 00:26:21,081
- I can help you, Agent Mulder.
- Find my cell phone?

293
00:26:21,165 --> 00:26:22,166
No.

294
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:27,588
With cover credentials.
A diplomatic passport and visa.

295
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:28,964
Why?

296
00:26:30,132 --> 00:26:32,342
Why are you helping me?

297
00:26:32,468 --> 00:26:33,677
Because I can.

298
00:26:35,846 --> 00:26:38,849
Because there are those of us
who believe in you.

299
00:26:39,475 --> 00:26:41,643
Believe in your search for the truth.

300
00:26:42,352 --> 00:26:45,189
- How long will it take?
- How long do you have?

301
00:27:12,758 --> 00:27:14,009
Where have you been?

302
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,887
Making travel arrangements.

303
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:20,891
- To go where?
- Follow the pouch.

304
00:27:23,227 --> 00:27:25,312
You're gonna keep me in the dark?

305
00:27:27,773 --> 00:27:29,399
<i>- (groans)
- Yeah.</i>

306
00:27:37,407 --> 00:27:39,493
These are level-four suits.

307
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:41,703
Exactly what he's wearing.

308
00:27:41,787 --> 00:27:46,667
Contamination is impossible unless
there's a tear or a loss of pressurisation.

309
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:50,045
Whatever happened to him,
it's unlikely it penetrated the suit.

310
00:27:50,128 --> 00:27:51,839
What do you think happened?

311
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:57,386
We won't know until we get in there
and take a closer look.

312
00:28:21,994 --> 00:28:24,371
Look. There's a film over everything.

313
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:30,335
It looks like spray kicked off the saw blade
when he was cutting into the rock.

314
00:28:45,934 --> 00:28:47,227
Oh, my God!

315
00:28:48,478 --> 00:28:49,688
This man's alive.

316
00:28:49,771 --> 00:28:52,024
He can't be. I mean, he's not breathing.

317
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:55,986
No, I think he is.
I think he's in some kind of a coma state

318
00:28:56,111 --> 00:28:57,279
or some kind of somatic rigour.

319
00:28:57,362 --> 00:28:58,447
From what?

320
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:01,825
I don't know,
but we have to get him outta here.

321
00:29:17,007 --> 00:29:19,009
- You're not...
- I'll leave the window down.

322
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:22,888
If I'm not back in a week, I'll call Scully
to bring you a bowl of water.

323
00:29:22,971 --> 00:29:24,056
Mulder!

324
00:29:25,182 --> 00:29:27,643

- Can this expose us?
- No, of course not.

Our necessary and plausible denial is intact.

00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:00,777
Then what is your concern?

342
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:05,741
Last night...

343
00:31:05,824 --> 00:31:10,996
...CIA Airport lntell had a man using
UN credentials appear on their computers...

344
00:31:11,496 --> 00:31:14,291
...booked on a flight for Krasnoyarsk, Russia.

345
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:15,542
Who was it?

346
00:31:18,128 --> 00:31:21,840
We haven't determined that
with any certainty as yet, but...

347
00:31:21,923 --> 00:31:25,302
...it appears to be a man
fitting the description of...

348
00:31:25,594 --> 00:31:26,720
...Fox Mulder.

349
00:31:27,512 --> 00:31:28,638
You fool.

350
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:30,265
You stupid fool.

351
00:31:31,016 --> 00:31:33,310
This must be corrected. It must be handled.

352
00:31:33,393 --> 00:31:37,272
Well, of course it can be.
You know my capabilities in a crisis.

353
00:31:38,815 --> 00:31:41,985
I don't think you realise what's at stake
here...

354
00:31:42,569 --> 00:31:44,946
...what level this must be carried to.

355
00:31:45,947 --> 00:31:48,450
This will take more than just a good aim!

356
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:55,665
Senator Sorenson wants to see us?

357
00:31:55,749 --> 00:31:58,210
That's usually
what a letter of summons means.

358
00:31:58,293 --> 00:32:00,921
- But a summons for what?
- I can only guess.

359
00:32:01,505 --> 00:32:04,299
But the fact I'm named
with you and Agent Mulder...

360
00:32:04,382 --> 00:32:09,513
...leads me to believe I've been implicated
in something more serious than I know.

361
00:32:10,555 --> 00:32:12,390
How much more serious, Scully?

362
00:32:13,391 --> 00:32:14,476
It's hard to say.

363
00:32:14,559 --> 00:32:17,395
More serious than
harbouring a known felon?

364
00:32:19,773 --> 00:32:21,525
What about Agent Mulder?
What does he know?

365
00:32:22,317 --> 00:32:25,570
Agent Mulder is endeavouring
to get his own answers, sir.

366
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,364
Where?

367
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:49,803
<i>(speaking in Russian)</i>

368
00:32:53,765 --> 00:32:57,394
- It's five kilometres through those woods.
- Let's go.

369
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:21,376
You're really going to keep me in the dark,
aren't you?

370
00:33:24,504 --> 00:33:26,590
What are we doing here, Mulder?

371
00:33:30,177 --> 00:33:31,803
June 30, 1908.

372
00:33:32,596 --> 00:33:39,102
Tunguska tribesmen look into the Siberian
sky and see a fireball streaking to Earth.

373
00:33:39,186 --> 00:33:42,272
When it hit the atmosphere,
it created cataclysmic explosions...

374
00:33:42,355 --> 00:33:46,735
...considered to be the largest single
cosmic event in the history of civilisation -

375
00:33:46,818 --> 00:33:50,113
...2,000 times the force of the bomb
that was dropped on Hiroshima.

376
00:33:50,197 --> 00:33:51,323
What was it?

377
00:33:52,699 --> 00:33:56,995
It's been speculated that it was
a piece of a comet or an asteroid...

378
00:33:57,204 --> 00:33:58,747
...or a piece of antimatter.

379
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:02,959
The power of the blast levelled trees
in a radial pattern for 2,000 kilometres.

380
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:07,255
No real evidence has ever been found
to provide a satisfying explanation...

381
00:34:07,339 --> 00:34:08,715
...for what it was.

382
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,557
I think somebody found that evidence...

383
00:34:17,641 --> 00:34:21,645
...and the explanation is something
that nobody ever dreamed of.

384
00:34:45,710 --> 00:34:47,003
What are they doing?

385
00:34:57,555 --> 00:35:00,016
Looks like some kind of mining camp.

386
00:35:11,987 --> 00:35:13,989
I don't think they're miners.

387
00:35:16,324 --> 00:35:18,451
<i>(horses approaching, shouting)</i>

388
00:35:19,035 --> 00:35:20,161
Run!

389
00:36:16,468 --> 00:36:17,594
<i>(Whip cracks)</i>

390
00:36:26,436 --> 00:36:27,729
<i>(whispering)</i>

391
00:36:32,108 --> 00:36:34,277

392
00:36:39,824 --> 00:36:40,950
<i>(coughs)</i>

393
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:50,418

<i>(whispering continues)</i>

395
00:37:01,721 --> 00:37:03,390
I don't speak Russian.

396
00:37:05,392 --> 00:37:07,477
Then no one has told you.

397
00:37:19,489 --> 00:37:20,740
Told me what?

398
00:37:20,824 --> 00:37:23,201
That you were brought here to die...

399
00:37:23,868 --> 00:37:27,122
- ...to wish you were dead.
- I wasn't brought here.

400
00:37:27,205 --> 00:37:29,749
I came here looking for something.

401
00:37:29,833 --> 00:37:34,212
The only thing you will find here
is death and suffering.

402
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:39,050
- What is this place?
- This place?

403
00:37:40,218 --> 00:37:41,344
A gulag.

404
00:37:42,053 --> 00:37:44,556
A place where the guilty rule the innocent.

405
00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:46,683
<i>(keys rattling, door clanging)</i>

406
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:50,520
<i>(speaking in Russian)</i>

407
00:37:58,445 --> 00:38:00,029
We gotta get out of here.

408
00:38:00,864 --> 00:38:02,449
They're gonna torture us.

409
00:38:04,951 --> 00:38:06,035
How do you know?

410
00:38:07,036 --> 00:38:09,038
They were questioning me...

411
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:12,167
...trying to get me to confess.

412
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,251
To what?

413
00:38:13,751 --> 00:38:14,919
To being a SPY-

414
00:38:16,212 --> 00:38:17,589
What'd you tell them?

415
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:20,884
That we were stupid Americans
lost in the woods.

416
00:38:24,929 --> 00:38:27,390
Mulder, you're gonna need me in here.

417
00:38:33,813 --> 00:38:35,231
Don't touch me again.

418
00:38:54,167 --> 00:38:58,421
Ah, Agent Scully, Mr Skinner.
Thank you for coming.

419
00:38:58,671 --> 00:39:01,925
It's difficult to decline an invitation
from a member of Congress.

420
00:39:02,008 --> 00:39:03,468
Please, have a seat.

421
00:39:09,140 --> 00:39:13,478
Are you familiar with the penalties
for obstruction of justice?

422
00:39:15,271 --> 00:39:17,440
Is that a rhetorical question, sir?

423
00:39:19,817 --> 00:39:22,904
You know why
you've been called here today?

424
00:39:22,987 --> 00:39:24,197
We have an idea.

425
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,325
We've been looking into the death
of this man outside your apartment...

426
00:39:27,450 --> 00:39:30,578
...Mr Skinner, and it's raised
some troubling questions.

427
00:39:30,662 --> 00:39:31,704
Such as?

428
00:39:31,788 --> 00:39:36,209
Such as what this man was doing
on your balcony before he fell to his death.

429
00:39:38,461 --> 00:39:41,464
It was your balcony, wasn't it, Mr Skinner?

430
00:39:44,008 --> 00:39:48,596
Perjury is a very serious of fence,
particularly for an FBI agent.

431
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,015
We intend to file a report on this matter...

432
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:55,061
...once we fully understand
what it is that we're investigating.

433
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,149
And...

434
00:40:00,650 --> 00:40:02,986
...Agent... Mulder.

435
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:07,824
Can you explain why he declined
my invitation to be here today?

436
00:40:07,907 --> 00:40:12,870
Agent Mulder is in the field, sir, seeking
answers to the questions you are asking.

437
00:40:12,996 --> 00:40:15,373
And where is he seeking these answers?

438
00:40:19,711 --> 00:40:21,004
Agent Scully?

- That I want to see his supervisor.

<i>Do svidaniya.</i>

444
00:41:38,498 --> 00:41:40,958
That man is not your friend.

445
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:44,253
He speaks differently to the guards.

446
00:41:45,838 --> 00:41:48,591
Formal language, as if to an equal.

447
00:41:49,175 --> 00:41:51,427
You are deceived.

448
00:41:51,511 --> 00:41:52,512
Who are you?

449
00:41:52,595 --> 00:41:54,764
A prisoner, like you.

450
00:41:55,431 --> 00:41:58,476
- But I have committed no crime.
- Then why are you here?

451
00:41:58,601 --> 00:42:00,478
To do the work, like the others.

452
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:05,650
Like them, I will die in an experiment...

453
00:42:06,275 --> 00:42:08,611
...when there is no longer any use for me.
