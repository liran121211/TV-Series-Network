1
00:00:07,467 --> 00:00:09,553
Miss Holland, I'm Nurse Waite.

2
00:00:09,636 --> 00:00:12,347
I'll be assisting in your procedure.

3
00:00:12,973 --> 00:00:14,433
Will it hurt?

4
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:16,852
You won't feel a thing. There's no blood.

5
00:00:16,935 --> 00:00:19,938
Dr Lloyd's done over a thousand
lipo procedures.

6
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:22,441
You're in good hands.

7
00:00:25,027 --> 00:00:27,029
<i>(orderly) OK, here we go.</i>

8
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:36,538
I'm going to give you a tranquilliser now...

9
00:00:36,622 --> 00:00:40,792
...then the doctor will give you injections
of saline and anaesthetic.

10
00:00:40,876 --> 00:00:44,546
All you have to worry about
is buying a new wardrobe.

11
00:00:50,969 --> 00:00:53,847
Your liposuction patient is prepped
and in room five.

12
00:00:53,972 --> 00:00:56,558
Fine. What else am I scheduled for?

13
00:00:56,642 --> 00:00:59,811
You've got a scalp reduction
and a blepharoplasty.

14
00:00:59,895 --> 00:01:01,813
Are they prepped?

15
00:01:02,022 --> 00:01:05,567
- Um, no. Would you like...?
- Get them ready, please.

16
00:01:05,651 --> 00:01:08,028
I'd like to move right along today.

17
00:01:08,153 --> 00:01:10,072
Yes, doctor.

18
00:01:31,677 --> 00:01:33,512
<i>(whirring)</i>

19
00:02:13,927 --> 00:02:15,846
How are you doing?

20
00:02:15,929 --> 00:02:18,348
Is the doctor going to be much longer?

21
00:02:18,432 --> 00:02:21,101
I think my tranquilliser's
starting to wear off.

22
00:02:21,268 --> 00:02:24,062
I'm sorry. I don't know where...

23
00:02:57,429 --> 00:02:58,930
Dr Lloyd!

24
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:05,270
I think this patient is finished.

25
00:03:54,236 --> 00:03:56,405
What else do you call it?

26
00:03:56,488 --> 00:03:59,825
When you're in your body
and out of it at the same time...

27
00:03:59,908 --> 00:04:02,619
...unable to control your actions...

28
00:04:02,702 --> 00:04:06,998
...to stop yourself from doing
what I did to that poor man?

29
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:12,170
- What else do you call it?
- Spirit possession or demon possession?

30
00:04:13,463 --> 00:04:17,175
While these mental states
have been well documented...

31
00:04:17,259 --> 00:04:23,181
...they've been much maligned and haven't
held up in court well as a criminal defence.

32
00:04:23,306 --> 00:04:26,685
I have advised my client
against speaking to you.

33
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:31,523
I'd appreciate it if you would direct
any legal discussion to counsel.

34
00:04:32,107 --> 00:04:35,444
Dr Lloyd, are you taking
any kind of medication?

35
00:04:35,527 --> 00:04:39,448
The odd sleeping pill
and a prescription antacid for my stomach.

36
00:04:39,531 --> 00:04:42,200
Would you mind
if I check the dosage and which ones?

37
00:04:42,284 --> 00:04:43,827
No, I really...

38
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:46,496
I would like to know why...

39
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:49,916
You've got a clear picture
of my client's story...

40
00:04:50,292 --> 00:04:54,004
...and his willingness to go along
with your investigation.

41
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,257
Yes, I believe we have.

42
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,887
Dr Lloyd,
you say that you've taken sleeping pills.

43
00:05:02,137 --> 00:05:04,306
How much sleep
did you get the night before?

44
00:05:09,394 --> 00:05:12,481
I, um... I can't recall.

45
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:25,243
The sleeping pill he was taking
was called Somanil.

46
00:05:25,327 --> 00:05:26,536
I've heard of it.

47
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:32,000
It works directly on the central nervous
system and it isn't stored in body tissue.

48
00:05:32,083 --> 00:05:37,005
But it's controversial for its addictiveness
and its effect on long-term behaviour.

49
00:05:37,214 --> 00:05:40,926
What was... What was the date
of Dr Lloyd's prescription?

50
00:05:41,927 --> 00:05:45,138
He started taking it five years ago,
and went through...

51
00:05:45,222 --> 00:05:48,850
Oh, he took a lot of it: 19100-tablet refills.

52
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,854
- Wow.
- Yeah.

53
00:05:58,527 --> 00:06:02,239
- That's more than a pill a day.
- An addiction, in other words.

54
00:06:02,322 --> 00:06:06,618
An addiction which very well could have
altered his ability to do his job.

55
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,496
How many of these procedures
would you say he's performed?

56
00:06:09,829 --> 00:06:12,332
Judging from his schedule
the day of the accident...

57
00:06:12,415 --> 00:06:14,793
...hundreds, and probably thousands.

58
00:06:14,876 --> 00:06:16,878
And not one fatality.

59
00:06:16,962 --> 00:06:21,341
You're missing my point, Mulder.
This place is a veritable factory.

60
00:06:21,424 --> 00:06:27,389
Cosmetic surgery is a boom industry.
ASU wards like this are a gold mine.

61
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:30,350
Everybody's doing it, so I hear.

62
00:06:30,433 --> 00:06:35,063
A brand-new, state-of-the-art facility like
this can support an entire hospital.

63
00:06:37,315 --> 00:06:40,151
- What do you suppose these are?
- What?

64
00:06:40,235 --> 00:06:43,738
These five marks on your brand-new,
state-of-the-art floor.

65
00:06:43,822 --> 00:06:47,742
They look like they were made
by the coasters from an OR table...

66
00:06:47,826 --> 00:06:49,786
...or some kind of equipment.

67
00:06:49,869 --> 00:06:52,914
They look to me
like they were burned or scorched.

68
00:07:01,423 --> 00:07:04,175
It's the shape of a pentagram.

69
00:07:08,305 --> 00:07:12,183
If you want to connect the dots here,
you should look at the facts.

70
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:18,857
Iatrogenic deaths or deaths due to doctor
error are upwards of 80,000 a year.

71
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:23,194
Dr Lloyd was pushing his limits.
He was an accident waiting to happen.

72
00:07:23,278 --> 00:07:25,739
I'm not a doctor, but you've
got to be pushing hard

73
00:07:25,822 --> 00:07:28,617
to mistake a beer belly for a bald head...

74
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:31,286
...not to mention door number three.

75
00:07:38,918 --> 00:07:41,838
It's amazing that no one saw him
in time to stop him.

76
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:43,965
Maybe they were all possessed.

77
00:07:44,049 --> 00:07:46,468
I don't think it's a simple possession.

78
00:07:46,551 --> 00:07:51,264
I think it's more like sorcery
or black magic or something like that.

79
00:07:51,348 --> 00:07:54,184
Excuse me.
What kind of procedure is that up there?

80
00:07:54,267 --> 00:07:56,728
It's a rhinoplasty. I'm sorry, who are you?

81
00:07:56,811 --> 00:08:00,231
We're with the FBI.
I'm Agent Scully and this is Agent Mulder.

82
00:08:00,315 --> 00:08:02,609
We're investigating a patient's death here.

83
00:08:02,692 --> 00:08:04,778
Oh, uh, yes.

84
00:08:05,362 --> 00:08:09,199
You're Rebecca Waite. You were
the attending nurse at the time?

85
00:08:09,282 --> 00:08:10,408
Yes.

86
00:08:10,492 --> 00:08:14,913
Can you explain what happened,
how a mistake like this could happen?

87
00:08:15,163 --> 00:08:17,749
No. No, I can't really.

88
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:23,713
I wasn't in the OR at the time and...
it's difficult for me in my position.

89
00:08:24,631 --> 00:08:28,134
Did you observe Dr Lloyd at all
before the accident?

90
00:08:28,551 --> 00:08:32,013
I helped prep the patient.
I was supposed to assist.

91
00:08:32,097 --> 00:08:34,015
I did my job as a nurse.

92
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:40,021
Are you aware that Dr Lloyd is claiming
he was possessed during the incident?

93
00:08:43,191 --> 00:08:46,486
I guess it's cheaper
than malpractice insurance.

94
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:54,160
Give him 500ccs of Ringer's wide open
before he goes to Recovery.

95
00:08:54,244 --> 00:08:57,247
- I need you to keep up with me.
- Right away, Dr Shannon.

96
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:59,624
Dr Shannon, can we have a word, please?

97
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:02,627
I've got a patient who can't wait.

98
00:09:07,882 --> 00:09:10,802
There's magic going on here, Mulder...

99
00:09:11,219 --> 00:09:15,557
...only it's being done with silicone,
collagen and a well-placed scalpel.

100
00:09:27,902 --> 00:09:33,032
What we have to do here is keep calm
and do nothing out of the ordinary.

101
00:09:33,116 --> 00:09:38,997
The appearance of any impropriety
will only deepen the FBl's probe...

102
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:41,750
...on top of Dr Lloyd's
insurance investigation.

103
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:44,335
Dr Lloyd has made us a target.

104
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:47,255
The last thing we need
is to be caught up in an expose.

105
00:09:47,338 --> 00:09:49,257
Then they look at our books again.

106
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:53,636
It's bad enough we have to explain why
buttock liposculptures cost 4,000 a pop.

107
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:56,931
We look greedy, therefore we look guilty.

108
00:09:57,348 --> 00:10:00,810
We haven't done
anything wrong, Dr lllaqua.

109
00:10:00,894 --> 00:10:04,189
If we give any credence or credibility
to Dr Lloyd's story,

110
00:10:04,272 --> 00:10:05,940
they'll burn us at the stake.

111
00:10:06,024 --> 00:10:10,820
What about the other personnel?
They were talking to the nurse, Waite.

112
00:10:11,654 --> 00:10:13,865
She can't tell them anything...

113
00:10:14,908 --> 00:10:17,577
...because she doesn't know anything.

114
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:22,665
I can't feel my feet.

115
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,461
I'm having a skin peel...

116
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:29,422
...but I can't feel my feet.

117
00:10:29,506 --> 00:10:30,840
It's OK. It's OK.

118
00:10:30,924 --> 00:10:34,344
Your feet are still there.
They aren't goin' anywhere.

119
00:10:34,427 --> 00:10:36,763
It's, it's just...

120
00:10:37,096 --> 00:10:39,933
...I'm afraid to be put to sleep.

121
00:10:40,433 --> 00:10:42,811
What if I don't wake up?

122
00:10:42,894 --> 00:10:45,605
Not to worry. Not to worry.

123
00:10:45,688 --> 00:10:47,941
I want you to relax...

124
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:52,237
...and think about your beautiful new face.

125
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,448
You're in good hands.

126
00:11:01,287 --> 00:11:03,081
We're going to protect you.

127
00:11:07,919 --> 00:11:09,712
<i>(knocking)</i>

128
00:11:14,592 --> 00:11:18,221
- You wanted to show me something?
- Yeah, a videotape.

129
00:11:19,889 --> 00:11:24,102
This video shows that
the five marks delineating the pentagram...

130
00:11:24,185 --> 00:11:27,272
...were in evidence prior
to the patient's death.

131
00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:28,690
Stop it a second.

132
00:11:30,191 --> 00:11:33,778
My God, he basically
stabbed the man to death in his sleep.

133
00:11:33,862 --> 00:11:35,613
Which underscores the strangeness.

134
00:11:35,697 --> 00:11:39,617
A sane man acting under his own volition
could never perform such an act.

135
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:41,119
Look.

136
00:11:42,662 --> 00:11:43,830
There.

137
00:11:43,913 --> 00:11:46,958
Presuming that has anything to do
with this, who put them there?

138
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:50,336
I don't know. A pentagram
is meant to be a symbol of protection...

139
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,338
...used to control the elemental forces.

140
00:11:52,422 --> 00:11:55,592
- Then it doesn't make sense.
- But it makes sense that witchcraft...

141
00:11:55,675 --> 00:12:00,179
...would find a theatre in a place like this,
preying on the weak and vainglorious.

142
00:12:00,263 --> 00:12:03,474
But there's no other evidence
of witchcraft taking place here.

143
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:07,770
Maybe there is. What was that prescription
that Dr Lloyd was taking?

144
00:12:07,854 --> 00:12:10,231
- The sleeping pills?
- No, the stomach antacid.

145
00:12:10,315 --> 00:12:12,317
Read me what it's made from.

146
00:12:13,735 --> 00:12:17,614
"An antispasmodic - active ingredients
include belladonna alkaloids..."

147
00:12:17,697 --> 00:12:22,076
Belladonna - also known as witch's berry.
That's an herb used in hexing rituals.

148
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,580
Do you know how many pharmaceuticals
contain belladonna?

149
00:12:25,663 --> 00:12:28,166
Yeah, just the one Dr Lloyd was taking.

150
00:12:28,249 --> 00:12:33,087
If it's that simple, why don't you put out
an APB for someone riding a broom?

151
00:12:34,756 --> 00:12:39,677
You jest, but there's a good chance
that this hex or ritual may not be finished.

152
00:12:45,892 --> 00:12:50,271
The FBI seems to have backed off,
at least for the time being.

153
00:12:50,355 --> 00:12:51,439
Yes.

154
00:12:51,522 --> 00:12:54,150
- Are you finished for the day?
- Yes.

155
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:57,612
I've got a laser peel. Then I'm outta here.

156
00:12:58,237 --> 00:13:03,368
We're gonna get through this, Eric. All we
have to do is keep our heads on straight.

157
00:13:04,953 --> 00:13:08,122
The patient's prepped.
ls there anything I can do?

158
00:13:08,206 --> 00:13:11,834
Yes, I'm gonna need
a clean pair of scrubs from the laundry.

159
00:13:11,918 --> 00:13:13,795
I'll get them now.

160
00:13:13,878 --> 00:13:16,422
Is there anything you need, Dr lllaqua?

161
00:13:16,506 --> 00:13:18,758
No, thank you.

162
00:13:38,987 --> 00:13:43,408
- Am I prepped in another room?
- No, your patient's in OR two.

163
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:45,451
Who's that?

164
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:51,457
That's Dr lllaqua.
What the hell is he doing with my patient?

165
00:13:51,541 --> 00:13:52,709
<i>(whirring)</i>

166
00:13:53,292 --> 00:13:54,711
(Shannon) Dr lllaqua!

00:13:55,086 --> 00:13:57,255
Open this door!

168
00:13:57,797 --> 00:14:01,092
Eric, open this door immediately!

169
00:14:01,718 --> 00:14:03,928
Dr lllaqua, do you hear me?

170
00:14:04,178 --> 00:14:06,597
You've got to stop this now!

171
00:14:06,681 --> 00:14:08,933
This is wrong! What are you doing?

172
00:14:11,936 --> 00:14:14,605
Eric! Open this door immediately!

173
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:16,941
This is Dr Shannon!

174
00:14:17,025 --> 00:14:20,695
I said stop this now! Stop!

175
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:28,870
You don't remember anything, Dr lllaqua?

176
00:14:28,953 --> 00:14:32,790
How you got in the room
or what compelled you to do such a thing?

177
00:14:33,124 --> 00:14:35,793
No. I was on my way home.

178
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,382
Do you realise what you've done now?

179
00:14:42,216 --> 00:14:43,384
Yes.

180
00:14:49,807 --> 00:14:50,975
May I?

181
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:01,235
I'll be right back.

182
00:15:28,471 --> 00:15:30,348
Did you examine the victim?

183
00:15:30,473 --> 00:15:33,184
No, just Dr lllaqua. Why?

184
00:15:33,309 --> 00:15:35,645
I found something else on the videotape.

185
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:49,700
Right there.

186
00:15:52,036 --> 00:15:53,287
What are they, bruises?

187
00:15:53,371 --> 00:15:54,664
I don't know,

188
00:15:54,747 --> 00:15:58,543
but the orientation of the points
describes a pentagram again. See?

189
00:16:00,211 --> 00:16:03,047
Well, I found something too.

190
00:16:04,173 --> 00:16:06,300
That's the same prescription as Dr Lloyd.

191
00:16:06,384 --> 00:16:09,303
You think it's just a coincidence?

192
00:16:09,387 --> 00:16:11,389
Yeah.

193
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:15,393
Any change in scheduling or workload...

194
00:16:15,476 --> 00:16:18,563
...is going to give the appearance
of covering guilt.

195
00:16:18,688 --> 00:16:21,566
We can't compromise our position on this.

196
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:26,070
Sorry to barge in,
but this is a matter of urgency.

197
00:16:26,154 --> 00:16:30,575
No, please. I'm Dr Jack Franklin.
May we ask you to sit down?

198
00:16:30,867 --> 00:16:33,494
It appears we've interrupted a gathering.

199
00:16:33,578 --> 00:16:35,246
Gathering?

200
00:16:35,371 --> 00:16:39,834
Sir, can you imagine this group's concern
about what's happened...

201
00:16:39,917 --> 00:16:42,420
...and our urgency to resolve this...

202
00:16:42,545 --> 00:16:46,382
...and to finally bring
the person responsible to justice?

203
00:16:46,883 --> 00:16:48,050
Finally?

204
00:16:51,762 --> 00:16:54,223
I don't know how much of this you know...

205
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:57,018
...but ten years ago...

206
00:16:57,101 --> 00:17:01,606
...there were several deaths
at this hospital, here in the ASU...

207
00:17:01,689 --> 00:17:04,192
...and, like the recent deaths...

208
00:17:04,275 --> 00:17:06,527
...they were all ruled accidental.

209
00:17:06,611 --> 00:17:10,448
- Were any of you here at the time?
- A few of us, yes, but...

210
00:17:11,616 --> 00:17:13,618
...more importantly...

211
00:17:13,951 --> 00:17:16,787
...there's a nurse, Rebecca Waite.

212
00:17:16,871 --> 00:17:19,957
She was on the ward
during those incidents.

213
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:24,212
Six weeks ago,
she transferred back here to the ASU.

214
00:17:24,795 --> 00:17:27,882
Do you have any other reasons
to suspect her?

215
00:17:27,965 --> 00:17:30,801
She's the only person
who had some contact...

216
00:17:30,927 --> 00:17:34,222
...with each of the victims
and the doctors involved.

217
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:38,059
- Have you spoken with her?
- No, she left early...

218
00:17:38,142 --> 00:17:40,478
...and no one's been able to find her.

219
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:46,901
<i>(woman chanting softly
in foreign language)</i>

220
00:18:23,938 --> 00:18:25,940
<i>(chanting continues)</i>

221
00:19:19,702 --> 00:19:20,870
<i>(cat meows)</i>

222
00:19:37,928 --> 00:19:39,764
Probable cause.

223
00:19:39,889 --> 00:19:42,099
Under suspicion of being a witch?

224
00:20:10,294 --> 00:20:11,962
Mulder.

225
00:20:21,138 --> 00:20:23,474
What could she have been doing in here?

226
00:20:23,557 --> 00:20:26,143
Probably not tax returns.

227
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,592
<i>(water dripping)</i>

228
00:21:19,864 --> 00:21:21,198
<i>(dripping)</i>

229
00:23:02,216 --> 00:23:06,136
<i>You have reached the 911 emergency line.
Please stay on the line.</i>

230
00:23:06,262 --> 00:23:07,805
<i>(growls)</i>

231
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:29,493
You don't know what you're doing.
Let me go! They don't understand.

232
00:23:29,577 --> 00:23:31,829
- You have to tell them.
- I want to speak to her.

233
00:23:31,954 --> 00:23:34,081
- Tell them!
- Mulder, don't.

234
00:23:34,164 --> 00:23:36,500
I tried to stop him, but it's too powerful.

235
00:23:36,584 --> 00:23:38,586
Someone has to stop...

236
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:41,422
<i>(gasping, gagging)</i>

237
00:23:48,095 --> 00:23:51,515
- Get the paramedics over here.
- (retching)

238
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:54,184
Get the paramedics over here now!

239
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:09,116
She swallowed straight pins
and is bleeding internally.

240
00:24:09,199 --> 00:24:11,452
Get her into surgery immediately.

241
00:24:11,535 --> 00:24:13,370
<i>(paramedic) There you go.</i>

242
00:24:15,998 --> 00:24:18,167
I'm going with her to the ER.

243
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:27,968
<i>(siren blaring)</i>

244
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:40,981
I would have done it myself...

245
00:24:41,982 --> 00:24:43,734
...but I'm Still a little shaky.

246
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:47,237
Jack, you're a lot cooler
than I'd be if it'd been me.

247
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:52,034
Well, the important thing is...

248
00:24:52,993 --> 00:24:54,495
...it's over now.

249
00:24:54,578 --> 00:24:56,413
Dr Franklin?

250
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:58,540
Ah...

251
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:00,250
...Agent Mulder.

252
00:25:00,334 --> 00:25:05,005
- I came to see if you were OK.
- Yes, I'm fine. Thank you.

253
00:25:05,756 --> 00:25:09,510
That woman broke in.
She was in here waiting for him.

254
00:25:09,593 --> 00:25:13,722
- Looks like she took a good shot at you.
- Yes, apparently.

255
00:25:14,932 --> 00:25:19,269
Nothing that a little plastic surgery
won't fix up, though, huh?

256
00:25:19,395 --> 00:25:22,606
Do you have any idea
why she might have attacked you?

257
00:25:23,190 --> 00:25:25,943
I'm the one
who voiced suspicion about her.

258
00:25:26,694 --> 00:25:30,364
- She wouldn't have known that.
- It could've been any of us. She's mad.

259
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:33,867
We have reason to believe
she's a practitioner of ritual magic.

260
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:36,453
- Ritual magic?
- A practising witch.

261
00:25:38,038 --> 00:25:41,792
She's responsible
for Dr Lloyd and Dr lllaqua?

262
00:25:41,875 --> 00:25:45,295
Witchcraft caused them
to kill those patients?

263
00:25:45,713 --> 00:25:48,632
I think a lot remains to be proven.

264
00:25:49,299 --> 00:25:51,301
I'm sorry.

265
00:25:51,385 --> 00:25:55,472
This evening has been a bit much,
and I really need to get some rest.

266
00:25:55,973 --> 00:25:59,059
I think all of us would like
to get some rest...

267
00:25:59,143 --> 00:26:01,478
...get back to work and...

268
00:26:01,937 --> 00:26:03,647
...put this behind us.

269
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:09,546
- <i>(Scully)</i> Mulder, it's me.
- Come in. It's open.

270
00:27:14,051 --> 00:27:17,513
- God, you look tired.
- I do?

271
00:27:20,057 --> 00:27:24,478
I was at the hospital. Our suspect, Rebecca
Waite, was pronounced 20 minutes ago.

272
00:27:24,561 --> 00:27:26,063
Cause of death?

273
00:27:26,563 --> 00:27:29,399
Massive blood loss due to haemorrhaging...

274
00:27:29,525 --> 00:27:33,237
...caused by the expulsion
of hundreds of straight pins.

275
00:27:33,362 --> 00:27:35,656
You ever see anything like that?

276
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:39,743
Well, in med school I saw some weird stuff.

277
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:43,330
There's a psychiatric disorder called pica...

278
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:48,752
...which is characterised by the craving
for non-food objects like clay, rocks, glue.

279
00:27:49,753 --> 00:27:53,757
- But if she swallowed...
- She would have died long before that.

280
00:27:53,882 --> 00:27:59,429
Unless she didn't ingest them, which would
fit with a phenomenon called allotriophagy.

281
00:28:00,514 --> 00:28:04,268
- Allotriophagy?
- Spontaneous vomiting or disgorgement...

282
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:08,772
...of foul or strange objects, usually
associated with someone possessed.

283
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:12,192
I won't refute that this woman
was practising the occult...

284
00:28:12,276 --> 00:28:14,945
...but what comes out must first go in.

285
00:28:15,028 --> 00:28:18,031
According to this book,
people have coughed up things...

286
00:28:18,115 --> 00:28:21,785
...from cue balls to knives with
no explanation of how they got there.

287
00:28:22,077 --> 00:28:24,621
- Where'd you get this from?
- Rebecca Waite's house.

288
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:26,748
It's the same place I got this.

289
00:28:29,209 --> 00:28:33,380
This calendar was open at April.
The 30th is marked by a familiar symbol.

290
00:28:33,463 --> 00:28:35,465
What's the significance of the 30th?

291
00:28:35,591 --> 00:28:38,552
It's one of the four
greater witches' sabbaths.

292
00:28:38,635 --> 00:28:43,140
It's also known as Roodmas.
It's also the birth date of the first victim.

293
00:28:44,641 --> 00:28:46,602
Now, July 31st...

294
00:28:48,562 --> 00:28:50,981
...is also marked with a pentagram.

295
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:54,151
This coincides with Lammas,
another witches' sabbath.

296
00:28:54,276 --> 00:28:56,486
It's the birth date of the second victim.

297
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:59,072
She was choosing victims
based on their birthdays?

298
00:28:59,156 --> 00:29:02,659
No, no. Remember, I said
the pentagram is a protective symbol.

299
00:29:02,743 --> 00:29:04,870
I think Rebecca Waite was
trying to save them.

300
00:29:04,953 --> 00:29:06,413
I think she knew they were in danger.

301
00:29:06,496 --> 00:29:10,417
- Which made her attack Dr Franklin.
- She knew something about him...

302
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:14,463
...and we should find out what that is
before he goes back to work.

303
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:20,010
- I just got a disturbing call.
- From whom?

304
00:29:20,093 --> 00:29:24,431
The FBI. They were asking
about patients' birth dates.

305
00:29:25,307 --> 00:29:26,767
They're on their way over.

306
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:30,020
- I thought this was over.
- Apparently not.

307
00:29:30,145 --> 00:29:33,815
You have a good thing going, you can bet
somebody will try and take it away.

308
00:29:34,024 --> 00:29:37,277
I'm beginning to understand
why a man becomes a conservative.

309
00:29:37,361 --> 00:29:39,613
He's got something to conserve.

310
00:29:43,951 --> 00:29:47,287
- Are you all right, Jack?
- I didn't get much sleep last night.

311
00:29:47,371 --> 00:29:49,623
- Of course you didn't.
- I'll be fine.

312
00:29:56,129 --> 00:29:59,549
Gail, push my osteoplasty
back half an hour.

313
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:00,634
<i>Yes, doctor.</i>

314
00:30:00,717 --> 00:30:03,053
I'm taking your chem peel.
You're going home.

315
00:30:03,136 --> 00:30:07,224
- I said I'll be fine.
- Take a look at yourself.

316
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:10,811
You look like hell, Jack.

317
00:30:10,894 --> 00:30:13,563
Look, I appreciate the offer.

318
00:30:13,689 --> 00:30:18,568
Don't get me wrong.
I am not being magnanimous here.

319
00:30:18,652 --> 00:30:22,239
We just can't afford
to make any more mistakes right now.

320
00:30:28,245 --> 00:30:29,496
Yes, thank you.

321
00:30:30,247 --> 00:30:32,582
Dr Franklin's left, but his office confirms...

322
00:30:32,708 --> 00:30:35,836
...one of his patient's birthdays
corresponds with one of the sabbaths.

323
00:30:35,919 --> 00:30:39,089
- When is that patient scheduled?
- She's already in pre-op...

324
00:30:39,214 --> 00:30:41,758
...and one of the other doctors is filling in.

325
00:30:45,095 --> 00:30:47,097
Is Dr Franklin OK?

326
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:52,269
- He's just not feeling very well.
- Oh.

327
00:30:52,352 --> 00:30:55,439
I suppose this is one of those procedures...

328
00:30:55,522 --> 00:31:01,236
- ...that all doctors here can do, isn't it?
- Yes.

329
00:31:02,112 --> 00:31:04,197
Yes, Dr Franklin said...

330
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:07,951
...that a chemical skin peel is safe...

331
00:31:08,869 --> 00:31:11,455
...almost... risk-free.

332
00:31:24,259 --> 00:31:26,970
- We're <i>looking for</i> Dr <i>Shannon.</i>
- <i>(screaming)</i>

333
00:31:52,329 --> 00:31:57,417
Our practice has been affiliated
with Greenwood for 13 years.

334
00:31:57,501 --> 00:32:02,005
Now the ASU accounts for over 50%
of this hospital's revenue.

335
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:06,093
Do you understand what that means?

336
00:32:06,176 --> 00:32:09,346
That doctors in other fields
have seen their earnings fall...

337
00:32:09,471 --> 00:32:12,682
...because of managed health care,
and you've all become wealthy.

338
00:32:12,808 --> 00:32:15,936
We fill a need. We didn't create it.

339
00:32:19,356 --> 00:32:21,358
Everyone wants to be beautiful.

340
00:32:23,819 --> 00:32:26,613
But our success made us arrogant.

341
00:32:26,696 --> 00:32:30,534
I'm willing to accept responsibility
for certain of our... mistakes.

342
00:32:30,617 --> 00:32:33,954
Mistakes? Like those patient deaths
ten years ago?

343
00:32:37,332 --> 00:32:42,712
That any of us could be capable of such
gross negligence was inconceivable.

344
00:32:42,796 --> 00:32:44,339
So you covered it up.

345
00:32:44,422 --> 00:32:47,926
If we did, it was with
the hospital's blessing.

346
00:32:49,136 --> 00:32:51,179
They conducted the investigation.

347
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:56,977
We had become too valuable an asset...

348
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:01,398
...something they had to protect,
even at the cost of five lives.

349
00:33:02,899 --> 00:33:06,361
- There were five deaths?
- Yes, four patients.

350
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:12,325
The fifth was a colleague of ours who,
for all intents and purposes...

351
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:15,745
...worked himself to death.
He died of a drug overdose.

352
00:33:15,871 --> 00:33:20,250
- What was his name?
- Dr Cox. Clifford Cox.

353
00:33:20,333 --> 00:33:22,586
- Do you have a file on him?
- In the computer.

354
00:33:22,711 --> 00:33:25,839
I'll need that and the files
on the deaths ten years ago.

355
00:33:25,922 --> 00:33:28,091
Why? What are you thinking?

356
00:33:30,177 --> 00:33:33,263
Dr Clifford Cox. Birthday: July 7, 1939.

357
00:33:33,388 --> 00:33:37,601
Can you take that photo and run it through
the cosmetic-surgery program I saw?

358
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:41,104
It will take me a few seconds
to load up the software.

359
00:33:43,231 --> 00:33:46,109
I'm still not sure
where you're going with this.

360
00:33:46,234 --> 00:33:48,361
Ten years ago, four patients died.

361
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:52,282
Like recent victims, their birth dates
matched the witches' sabbaths,

362
00:33:52,365 --> 00:33:53,783
except Dr Cox.

363
00:33:53,867 --> 00:33:58,455
But Cox was a doctor. Nothing about his
death matches up except its coincidence.

364
00:33:58,538 --> 00:34:00,540
Maybe, maybe not.

365
00:34:00,957 --> 00:34:02,292
I'm online here.

366
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:14,721
This software gives patients
an idea of their projected result, right?

367
00:34:14,804 --> 00:34:19,476
Within the limits of what the patient comes
in with, we approach that aesthetic ideal.

368
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:23,063
The program is based upon
a matrix of relative proportions.

369
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:24,898
Vanity.

370
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:28,568
Vanity, all is vanity.

371
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:31,905
<i>(Shannon) Here it is.</i>

372
00:34:33,323 --> 00:34:36,993
Can you move the eyes further apart
and strengthen the forehead?

373
00:34:37,118 --> 00:34:41,289
- That's beyond our surgical capabilities.
- I know.

374
00:34:47,337 --> 00:34:49,297
I don't understand.

375
00:34:51,341 --> 00:34:52,842
It looks like Jack Franklin.

376
00:34:56,596 --> 00:34:58,098
<i>(panting)</i>

377
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:21,496
<i>(panting)</i>

378
00:35:41,766 --> 00:35:44,477
- Where else could he be?
- I don't know.

379
00:35:44,561 --> 00:35:47,314
I'll check the OR. Maybe he's there.

380
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:50,525
- He's not answering his pages.
- Did you try his home?

381
00:35:50,608 --> 00:35:52,610
Answering machine.

382
00:35:52,736 --> 00:35:57,324
Are you thinking Dr Cox murdered these
patients and then became Dr Franklin?

383
00:35:57,407 --> 00:36:01,202
I think he murdered those patients
so he could become Dr Franklin.

384
00:36:01,286 --> 00:36:03,872
This transformation is medically impossible.

385
00:36:03,955 --> 00:36:06,833
It's not medicine, Scully. It's blood sacrifice.

386
00:36:06,916 --> 00:36:09,336
- Blood sacrifice?
- The most potent offering in black magic.

387
00:36:09,419 --> 00:36:12,213
What if, having reached
the limits of medical miracles...

388
00:36:12,297 --> 00:36:14,174
...he decided to stage a miracle of his own?

389
00:36:14,257 --> 00:36:18,261
So he committed these murders
in order to make himself beautiful?

390
00:36:18,345 --> 00:36:20,972
Everybody wants to be beautiful, Scully.

391
00:37:07,644 --> 00:37:08,978
Jack!

392
00:37:11,815 --> 00:37:13,858
What are you doing?

393
00:37:13,983 --> 00:37:16,319
I'm so glad that you're here.

394
00:37:19,364 --> 00:37:21,825
Jack, stay right where you are.

395
00:37:23,493 --> 00:37:24,661
<i>(gasps)</i>

396
00:37:35,755 --> 00:37:40,343
I hope those instruments
were properly sterilised.

397
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:42,345
<i>(gasping)</i>

398
00:37:51,771 --> 00:37:53,940
Dr Franklin?

399
00:38:17,213 --> 00:38:19,215
Scully, come over here.

400
00:38:26,764 --> 00:38:30,393
Stop right there.
Look what you're standing on.

401
00:38:33,104 --> 00:38:35,106
This one's different.

402
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:38,401
It's been inverted.

403
00:38:39,402 --> 00:38:41,905
See these two upright points here?

404
00:38:41,988 --> 00:38:46,451
They represent the goat of lust,
attacking heaven with its horns.

405
00:38:46,576 --> 00:38:50,830
He's inscribed all the names
of the patients who were killed.

406
00:38:53,416 --> 00:38:55,460
Including Dr Shannon.

407
00:38:58,338 --> 00:39:00,673
(man) Clear the way! Moving through!

408
00:39:01,674 --> 00:39:03,676
What did you swallow?

409
00:39:04,260 --> 00:39:07,055
- What did you swallow?
- (orderly) She didn't say.

410
00:39:07,138 --> 00:39:09,933
I'm going in
to do an exploratory laparotomy.

411
00:39:11,768 --> 00:39:13,603
<i>(mumbling) Please... don't.</i>

412
00:39:14,604 --> 00:39:18,316
Give her two units blood, stat. Someone
get a 16-gauge IV in and open it wide.

413
00:39:18,441 --> 00:39:20,443
(woman) I'll get the IV, doctor.

414
00:39:22,612 --> 00:39:25,114
No. Please, no.

415
00:39:26,950 --> 00:39:29,953
No. No, please, don't.

416
00:39:48,805 --> 00:39:53,476
Where's Dr Shannon? They said
she was brought here in an emergency.

417
00:39:59,315 --> 00:40:00,650
Mulder, here.

418
00:40:04,737 --> 00:40:07,865
Don't let them operate.
Hold them off until you hear from me.

419
00:40:07,991 --> 00:40:10,660
- Where are you going?
- To find Dr Franklin.

420
00:40:36,185 --> 00:40:38,062
- More snaps.
- Here you go.

421
00:40:38,187 --> 00:40:39,522
SPOHQe it.

422
00:40:39,731 --> 00:40:41,691
- Suction.
- Suction.

423
00:40:44,444 --> 00:40:46,362
- (doctor) Flush.
- Saline.

424
00:40:46,446 --> 00:40:48,698
- More sponge.
- Lap.

425
00:40:49,532 --> 00:40:52,785
- You have to stop this procedure!
- Whoever that person is, get her out now!

426
00:40:52,869 --> 00:40:55,288
I'm Special Agent Dana Scully, FBI.

427
00:40:55,371 --> 00:40:58,374
- Get out of here now!
- Listen to me! I'm a doctor!

428
00:40:59,626 --> 00:41:02,170
- What the hell's going on?
- I'm a federal agent.

429
00:41:02,253 --> 00:41:05,340
I don't care who you are.
You can't interrupt a surgery.

430
00:41:05,423 --> 00:41:08,968
- This woman could die.
- That's what I'm trying to prevent.

431
00:41:52,762 --> 00:41:55,932
- What happened?
- They saved her life.

432
00:41:56,432 --> 00:42:01,688
They just pulled a whole rack of surgical
instruments out of her intestinal tract.

433
00:42:01,771 --> 00:42:03,773
God knows how they got there.

434
00:42:05,274 --> 00:42:06,359
Then it failed.

435
00:42:06,442 --> 00:42:10,279
<i>- (intercom) Code blue team to the ER, stat.
- (screaming)</i>

436
00:42:11,114 --> 00:42:13,116
<i>(alarm blaring)</i>

437
00:42:19,122 --> 00:42:21,999
I tried to stop him! He just went crazy!

438
00:42:22,125 --> 00:42:24,085
We're losing her! Fast!

439
00:42:24,168 --> 00:42:26,462
What is this patient's birth date?

440
00:42:31,342 --> 00:42:33,344
October 31 st.

441
00:42:34,137 --> 00:42:38,182
- Halloween.
- And Samhain, the fourth witches' sabbath.

442
00:42:55,324 --> 00:42:57,034
I can't tell you how happy we are...

443
00:42:57,160 --> 00:43:00,163
...that you've decided to join us, Dr Hartman.

444
00:43:00,246 --> 00:43:03,249
Well, I like what I've seen so far.

445
00:43:04,167 --> 00:43:07,336
The truth is,
I've always been drawn to Los Angeles.

446
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:11,048
With your credentials,
I'm sure you had plenty of options.

447
00:43:12,675 --> 00:43:16,179
I've been reviewing your patient portfolio.

448
00:43:16,262 --> 00:43:20,016
Your work is among
the most impressive I've ever seen.

449
00:43:20,349 --> 00:43:25,062
I like to say whoever God didn't get around
to creating in his own image...

450
00:43:25,188 --> 00:43:27,523
...it's ourjob to recreate in ours.
