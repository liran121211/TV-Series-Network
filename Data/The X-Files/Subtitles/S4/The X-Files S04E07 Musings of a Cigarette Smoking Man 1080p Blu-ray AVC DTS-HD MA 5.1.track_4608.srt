<i>(siren blaring in distance)</i>

00:01:09,571 --> 00:01:12,824
<i>(Scully) Not everything is a conspiracy.
You're shaking.</i>

6
00:01:12,908 --> 00:01:15,285
<i>(Mulder) One at a time. What's going on?</i>

7
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:17,329
<i>- (man) Frohike's close.
- Don't use my name!</i>

8
00:01:17,412 --> 00:01:19,289
<i>Now I'll have to kill you!</i>

9
00:01:19,373 --> 00:01:22,501
<i>(man) Langley and I
did three sweeps with the CPM-700.</i>

10
00:01:22,584 --> 00:01:24,503
<i>(Frohike) The CPM-700 is</i> a <i>piece of crap!</i>

11
00:01:24,586 --> 00:01:26,964
<i>(man) The acoustic correlator
is reading passive sounds.</i>

12
00:01:27,047 --> 00:01:30,133
<i>(Mulder) I still don't know
what the hell is wrong!</i>

13
00:01:30,217 --> 00:01:32,970
<i>No one would kill you, Frohike.
You're a puppy dog.</i>

14
00:01:33,053 --> 00:01:37,891
<i>(man 2) I don't say any more until the
CSM-25 counter measure filter is activated.</i>

16
00:01:41,353 --> 00:01:42,562
<i>(Static)</i>

17
00:01:43,188 --> 00:01:45,857
<i>(man) Nothing can cut through the CSM-25.</i>

18
00:01:45,941 --> 00:01:50,654
<i>(Scully) OK, OK.
Now tell us what you're so close to.</i>

19
00:01:50,988 --> 00:01:53,490
<i>(Frohike) Not a what, a who.</i>

20
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:55,909
<i>If you find the starting point and follow it,</i>

21
00:01:55,993 --> 00:01:58,996
<i>not even secrets
of the darkest of men are safe.</i>

22
00:01:59,955 --> 00:02:01,581
<i>(Mulder) Cancer Man?</i>

23
00:02:03,166 --> 00:02:06,295
<i>- What did you find?
- (Frohike) Possibly everything.</i>

24
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:10,632
<i>Maybe his background, who he is,
and who he wants to be.</i>

25
00:03:04,561 --> 00:03:06,938
<i>August 20th, 1940, Mexico City.</i>

26
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:10,776
<i>A Stalinist agent assassinated
Leon Trotsky with an ice pick.</i>

27
00:03:10,859 --> 00:03:13,070
<i>At that same moment,
a thousand miles north,</i>

28
00:03:13,153 --> 00:03:16,990
<i>in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, he appears.</i>

29
00:03:17,074 --> 00:03:19,785
<i>The father was
an ardent Communist activist.</i>

30
00:03:19,868 --> 00:03:22,996
<i>During the Nazi-Soviet pact,
he kept the NKVD informed...</i>

31
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,665
<i>...on American plans to enter World War ll.</i>

32
00:03:25,749 --> 00:03:29,836
<i>He was executed
under the Espionage Act of 1917...</i>

33
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:32,172
<i>...before his boy could walk.</i>

34
00:03:32,255 --> 00:03:35,759
<i>The mother, a cigarette smoker,
died of lung cancer...</i>

35
00:03:35,842 --> 00:03:39,137
<i>...before her son uttered his first word.</i>

36
00:03:39,221 --> 00:03:42,140
<i>With no family,
he became a ward of the state...</i>

37
00:03:42,224 --> 00:03:44,935
<i>...sent to various orphanages
in the Midwest.</i>

38
00:03:45,018 --> 00:03:46,353
<i>Didn't make friends.</i>

39
00:03:46,436 --> 00:03:49,856
<i>Spent all his time reading - alone.</i>

40
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:53,110
<i>And then... he appears to have vanished...</i>

41
00:03:53,193 --> 00:03:56,696
<i>...until a year and a half after the Bay of Pigs.</i>

42
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:02,994
<i>(man) Premier Khrushchev, we want you!</i>

43
00:04:03,078 --> 00:04:06,206
(troops) Premier Khrushchev, we want you!

44
00:04:06,289 --> 00:04:09,167
We're gonna kick your rang-a-dang-doo!

45
00:04:09,251 --> 00:04:12,379
We're gonna kick your rang-a-dang-doo!

46
00:04:12,462 --> 00:04:15,298
Fidel Castro, we want you!

47
00:04:15,382 --> 00:04:18,301
Fidel Castro, we want you!

48
00:04:18,385 --> 00:04:21,012
We're gonna kick your rang-a-dang-doo!

49
00:04:21,096 --> 00:04:23,974
We're gonna kick your rang-a-dang-doo!

50
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:25,892
Mother Russia...

51
00:04:29,896 --> 00:04:32,899
(man) I wanna see that
when you're done with it.

52
00:04:37,696 --> 00:04:39,489
Why don't you go see the movie?

53
00:04:40,198 --> 00:04:45,036
I'd rather read the worst novel ever written
than sit through the best movie ever made.

54
00:04:45,745 --> 00:04:47,038
Captain, sir!

55
00:04:47,164 --> 00:04:50,625
General Francis requests
you report to his office ASAP, sir!

56
00:04:53,503 --> 00:04:56,715
My one-year-old just said his first word.

57
00:04:59,217 --> 00:05:01,636
- What was the word?
- JFK.

58
00:05:05,724 --> 00:05:08,018
Catch ya later, Mulder.

59
00:05:19,863 --> 00:05:22,032
<i>- (buzzer)
- (man) He's here, sir.</i>

60
00:05:23,283 --> 00:05:24,284
Send him in.

61
00:05:30,457 --> 00:05:32,542
You wish to see me, sir?

62
00:05:32,834 --> 00:05:34,920
Have a seat, Captain.

63
00:05:38,215 --> 00:05:43,136
Captain, have you ever seen these two men,
met the general, or myself?

64
00:05:43,428 --> 00:05:44,638
No, sir.

65
00:05:44,763 --> 00:05:48,767
In January, 1961,
did you aid Congo president Kasavuba...

66
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:52,020
...in the arrest and assassination
of Patrice Lumumba?

67
00:05:52,103 --> 00:05:53,146
No, sir.

68
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:56,775
Did you train Cuban nationals
during Operation Zapata...

69
00:05:56,858 --> 00:05:59,152
...also known as The Bay Of Pigs?

70
00:05:59,236 --> 00:06:02,072
I'm sorry, I'm unaware of
any such operation.

71
00:06:02,322 --> 00:06:03,823
On May 31st,1961...

72
00:06:03,907 --> 00:06:08,328
...did you aid Dominican locals
in the assassination of Rafael Trujillo?

73
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:10,330
No, sir.

74
00:06:11,831 --> 00:06:14,918
Your father was a convicted spy
for the Soviet Union.

75
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:18,296
Executed in a Louisiana electric chair,
was he not?

76
00:06:21,383 --> 00:06:24,844
My only regret, sir, is I was too young
to throw the switch myself.

77
00:06:25,345 --> 00:06:30,767
At ease, Captain. Your father's actions
were totally out of your control.

78
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:36,106
Each of us in this room understands
a life eviscerated by the actions of another.

79
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:37,649
Cigarette?

80
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:40,819
No, thank you, sir. I never touch 'em.

81
00:06:40,902 --> 00:06:46,950
You see, most people seek to control life's
events in order to secure a more positive...

82
00:06:47,033 --> 00:06:49,911
...productive and free existence.

83
00:06:49,995 --> 00:06:54,666
Often, however, the objectives of others
conflict with our objectives.

84
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,502
<i>Viva la Iibertad.</i>

85
00:06:57,586 --> 00:07:00,755
Now, most people -
common people, really -

86
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:05,677
...can barely manage to control
their own self-centred,, myopic existence.

87
00:07:08,263 --> 00:07:11,683
They command lawyers
armed with paper weapons...

88
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:16,229
...attacking with spiteful, vengeful,
cowardly litigation.

89
00:07:16,438 --> 00:07:17,981
Others...

90
00:07:18,857 --> 00:07:22,402
...operate within elephantine bureaucracies.

91
00:07:23,445 --> 00:07:25,405
And then, Captain...

92
00:07:27,824 --> 00:07:30,410
...there are extraordinary men.

93
00:07:32,245 --> 00:07:37,917
Those who must identify, comprehend
and ultimately shoulder the responsibility...

94
00:07:38,001 --> 00:07:40,754
...for not only their own existence...

95
00:07:40,837 --> 00:07:44,257
...but their country's,
and the world's as well.

96
00:07:45,634 --> 00:07:49,137
Your father, Captain, believed his country

97
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,765
should look to
another form of government...

98
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:54,726
...and he took control of that belief.

99
00:07:54,809 --> 00:07:57,646
So, in that respect...

100
00:07:57,729 --> 00:08:00,440
...we view him as an extraordinary man.

101
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:03,193
And we believe...

102
00:08:04,444 --> 00:08:08,239
...we <i>know,</i> Captain,
that it runs in the family.

103
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:11,618
Now, don't misunderstand.

104
00:08:11,701 --> 00:08:14,245
Your father should have been executed.

105
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:18,124
Communism is the most heinous
personification of evil...

106
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,627
...mankind has ever confronted.

107
00:08:20,710 --> 00:08:25,423
And it is, in part, the reason
that you are before us here today.

108
00:08:33,014 --> 00:08:39,145
You must understand everything I'm about
to say is classified "compartmentalised."

109
00:08:39,229 --> 00:08:41,815
So intensely
that if you accept this assignment...

110
00:08:41,898 --> 00:08:46,069
...and successfully execute it, you will
no longer be an officer of the US army...

111
00:08:46,152 --> 00:08:49,322
...nor will any record exist of your service.

112
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:54,703
The assignment...

113
00:08:54,786 --> 00:08:58,415
...is the assassination
of an American civilian, aged 46...

114
00:08:58,498 --> 00:09:01,876
...former naval PT boat commander.

115
00:09:03,712 --> 00:09:06,172
Married, father of two.

116
00:09:16,224 --> 00:09:21,312
Last week this country was brought
to the brink of nuclear annihilation.

117
00:09:21,396 --> 00:09:27,777
A situation which never would have arisen
had the individual, as commander in chief...

118
00:09:27,861 --> 00:09:33,366
...provided an umbrella of air support
during the invasion at Bahia de Cochinos.

119
00:09:34,451 --> 00:09:35,952
Is there a cover story?

120
00:09:36,035 --> 00:09:38,496
Tell 'em it was done
by men from outer space.

121
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,875
We've found and are setting up a patsy.

122
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,134
Where?

123
00:10:04,898 --> 00:10:07,567
You shouldn't smoke those, Lee.

124
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:10,487
I'm reading studies
that say they can kill you.

125
00:10:10,737 --> 00:10:11,738
Well...

126
00:10:12,947 --> 00:10:14,199
...Mr Hunt...

127
00:10:14,699 --> 00:10:15,742
...sir...

128
00:10:15,825 --> 00:10:18,620
...I've, uh, heard about those reports and...

129
00:10:18,703 --> 00:10:20,789
...they are no doubt correct.

130
00:10:20,872 --> 00:10:24,167
You'll have a good view
of the president today.

131
00:10:25,084 --> 00:10:28,671
I like the president's family.
They're interesting people.

132
00:10:28,755 --> 00:10:32,300
However, I have my own views
on the president's national policy.

133
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:34,803
I'll probably just eat lunch.

134
00:10:34,886 --> 00:10:37,472
I'm going to the movies
at the Texas Theatre.

135
00:10:37,555 --> 00:10:39,724
It's only 90 cents.

136
00:10:40,225 --> 00:10:42,227
I love the movies.

137
00:10:44,813 --> 00:10:47,440
I brought the curtain rods, Lee.

138
00:10:57,909 --> 00:11:00,703
I bought some
just like this back in March.

139
00:11:01,329 --> 00:11:02,455
You did?

140
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:04,374
Or AJ Hidell?

141
00:11:04,457 --> 00:11:08,753
Well, Mr Hunt,
Fidel's defenders have to be careful.

142
00:11:08,837 --> 00:11:11,172
Yes, we do.

143
00:11:11,256 --> 00:11:15,802
I've informed our fellow defender that you'll
hide the curtain rods on the 6th floor...

144
00:11:15,885 --> 00:11:20,056
...of the book depository,
behind the cartons against the back wall.

145
00:11:20,139 --> 00:11:22,183
The Cuban visa?

146
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:26,229
Once I've been notified the rods
have been removed from the depository...

147
00:11:26,312 --> 00:11:29,983
...the visa and the money for your trip
will be in your room.

148
00:11:30,859 --> 00:11:32,026
Take a bus.

149
00:11:33,194 --> 00:11:35,780
I left all my money with my wife.

150
00:11:39,701 --> 00:11:43,037
That's all I've got: 13 and change.

151
00:11:44,873 --> 00:11:49,252
You better get going, Lee. You wouldn't
want to miss your ride to work.

152
00:12:22,952 --> 00:12:25,246
<i>(shuffling sound)</i>

153
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:34,339
Oh! Good morning, Lee.
Starting work right on time.

154
00:12:34,422 --> 00:12:35,924
Yes, sir.

155
00:13:12,085 --> 00:13:16,089
The president should be driving past any
minute. Everyone's down on the 5th floor.

156
00:13:16,172 --> 00:13:18,049
Where's Lee? Does he wanna come?

157
00:13:31,813 --> 00:13:33,856
<i>(chattering)</i>

158
00:13:45,326 --> 00:13:47,745
<i>(cheering)</i>

159
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:54,502
<i>(man on radio) The president's car
is now turning onto Elm Street.</i>

160
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,382
<i>(sighs)</i>

161
00:13:59,465 --> 00:14:01,759
<i>I was on the Stemmons freeway earlier...</i>

162
00:14:01,843 --> 00:14:05,763
<i>...and it was jam-packed with spectators
waiting to see the president.</i>

163
00:14:05,847 --> 00:14:07,932
<i>People are really starting to crowd in.</i>

164
00:14:10,727 --> 00:14:13,938
<i>(buzzing sound)</i>

165
00:14:14,022 --> 00:14:16,941
<i>The motorcade
is heading down Elm Street now...</i>

166
00:14:17,025 --> 00:14:20,445
<i>...passing the Texas School Book Depository.</i>

167
00:14:24,115 --> 00:14:25,324
<i>(gunshot)</i>

168
00:14:26,909 --> 00:14:28,578
<i>(people screaming)</i>

169
00:14:30,455 --> 00:14:35,334
<i>I can't quite see from here. Something

00:15:01,986 --> 00:15:04,322
No! No! No, sir!

179
00:15:04,405 --> 00:15:06,324

Now easy there, partner.

00:15:37,772 --> 00:15:39,649
I just wanna talk a minute.

187

If I don't see valid credentials,
I'm gonna assume you're with them.

<i>(siren blaring)</i>

216
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:58,329
<i>(Martin Luther King)
We must, with positive action,</i>

00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,667
<i>...insecurity and injustice...</i>

219
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:08,089
<i>...which are the fertile soil in which the seed

220
00:18:08,172 --> 00:18:10,967
<i>These are revolutionary times.</i>

221
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:13,427
<i>All over the globe...</i>

222
00:18:13,511 --> 00:18:18,140
<i>...men are revolting against old systems
of exploitation and oppression.</i>

223
00:18:18,933 --> 00:18:21,269
<i>And out of the wombs of a frail world...</i>

224
00:18:21,352 --> 00:18:25,523
<i>...new systems of justice
and equality are being born.</i>

225

<i>The shirtless
and barefoot people of the land...</i>

226
00:18:28,693 --> 00:18:31,028
<i>...are rising up as never before.</i>

227
00:18:31,153 --> 00:18:33,990
"I can kill you whenever I please."

228
00:18:36,117 --> 00:18:40,621
<i>We in the West
must support these revolutions.</i>

229
00:18:40,705 --> 00:18:42,039
"But not today."

230
00:18:42,123 --> 00:18:44,792
<i>...because of comfort, complacency,</i> ...

231
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:50,214
<i>...a morbid fear of Communism
and our proneness to adjust to injustice...</i>

232
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:52,550
<i>...the Western nations that initiated...</i>

233
00:18:52,633 --> 00:18:57,221
<i>...so much of the revolutionary spirit
of the modern world...</i>

234
00:19:01,726 --> 00:19:06,564
<i>...driven many to feel that only Marxism

<i>The ref ore, Communism is a judgement...</i>

. <i>. against our failure
to make democracy real...</i>

237
00:19:12,987 --> 00:19:17,074
<i>...and follow through
on the revolutions that we initiated.</i>

238
00:19:17,158 --> 00:19:20,202
No, no. Why'd you have to do that?

239
00:19:20,411 --> 00:19:22,079
<i>To recapture the revolution...</i>

240
00:19:29,879 --> 00:19:32,340
Why didn't you know
this was coming, Edgar?

241
00:19:32,882 --> 00:19:34,091
<i>(coughs)</i>

242
00:19:34,759 --> 00:19:38,429
Last year the House was not smiling
on non eye-to-eye surveillance.

243
00:19:38,554 --> 00:19:39,597
So I stopped.

244
00:19:39,722 --> 00:19:45,144
We called Ramsey Clark to get a go-ahead
on tapping King's phone, but he refused.

245
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:50,358
Our "behind the fence" operations believes
that King's ally, Stokely Carmichael...

246
00:19:50,441 --> 00:19:54,028
...is recruitin' a Negro army
to wage war on white America.

247
00:19:54,945 --> 00:19:57,531
Wouldn't you, if you were them?

248
00:19:57,615 --> 00:19:59,033
If this were only a civil rights issue...

249
00:19:59,116 --> 00:20:02,870
...I'd vote for a King-Benjamin Spock
presidential ticket.

250
00:20:02,953 --> 00:20:04,872
But, after last night, it's not.

251
00:20:04,955 --> 00:20:07,208
You actually sound sad about it.

252
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:10,544
I respect King. He's an extraordinary man.

253
00:20:10,628 --> 00:20:13,464
But now he's talking like a Maoist.

254
00:20:13,547 --> 00:20:17,760
And if he convinces Negroes
not to fight in Vietnam, we'll lose.

255
00:20:18,719 --> 00:20:20,888
And the first domino will have fallen.

256
00:20:20,971 --> 00:20:23,224
We must step up our efforts
to discredit him.

257
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:25,976
Like your ridiculous suicide project?

258
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:28,979
"There is but one way out for you"?

259
00:20:29,105 --> 00:20:32,066
That letter
attempting to drive King into despair...

260
00:20:32,149 --> 00:20:36,112
...only alerted him
to the level of our surveillance.

261
00:20:36,404 --> 00:20:40,116
We could create a film of him
with a woman other than his wife.

262
00:20:41,158 --> 00:20:46,080
Using existing footage, we could insert him
in a film we make of a woman -

263
00:20:46,163 --> 00:20:47,665
...a white woman.

264
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:52,002
The solution is more intense...
than just dirty tricks.

265
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:59,343
If you'll excuse us, the director
has a meeting at the White House.

266
00:20:59,468 --> 00:21:00,511
Sit down!

267
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:05,933
You've enough plausible deniability
to last the rest of your nine lives.

268
00:21:09,687 --> 00:21:13,149
A SIG force
can execute a wet-insert operation.

269
00:21:13,816 --> 00:21:17,445
One day, he and his immediate circle
are just found dead.

270
00:21:18,654 --> 00:21:20,030
Too many questions.

271
00:21:21,532 --> 00:21:26,454
Americans believe the South
is still fighting the Civil War.

272
00:21:26,537 --> 00:21:32,209
We find ourselves a cracker patsy, and
the motives become very black and white.

273
00:21:32,543 --> 00:21:33,878
Another patsy.

274
00:21:35,004 --> 00:21:37,798
Should we advise the president?

275
00:21:37,882 --> 00:21:42,344
I work very hard to keep any president
from knowing I even exist.

276
00:21:43,721 --> 00:21:45,723
Who will you order to do it?

277
00:21:49,977 --> 00:21:52,062
I'll do it myself.

278
00:21:52,563 --> 00:21:55,316
I have too much respect for the man.

279
00:21:58,569 --> 00:22:00,738
<i>(King) The nation is sick.</i>

280
00:22:02,406 --> 00:22:06,660
<i>Trouble is in the land, confusion all around.</i>

281
00:22:06,744 --> 00:22:09,663
<i>That's a strange statement.</i>

282
00:22:09,747 --> 00:22:11,665
<i>But I know, somehow...</i>

283
00:22:11,749 --> 00:22:14,835
<i>...that only when it is dark enough...</i>

284
00:22:14,919 --> 00:22:17,338
<i>...can you see the stars.</i>

285
00:22:18,339 --> 00:22:20,424
<i>And I see God working...</i>

286
00:22:20,508 --> 00:22:23,886
<i>...in this period of the twentieth century...</i>

287
00:22:26,764 --> 00:22:28,098
<i>...in away...</i>

290
00:22:37,775 --> 00:22:40,611

291
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:46,033
<i>And wherever they are assembled today...</i>

292
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:50,454
<i>...whether they are in

<i>...Jackson, Mississippi

Raul.

300
00:23:17,773 --> 00:23:21,986
- I got the binoculars you sent me out for.
- Just put 'em down by your clothes.

301
00:23:22,111 --> 00:23:26,407
I heard Dr King's stayin'
at the Lorraine Motel right behind here.

302
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,743
Our gun buyer's coming by
to look at the rifle.

303
00:23:30,744 --> 00:23:32,746
Well, I gave it to you this mornin'.

305
00:23:35,124 --> 00:23:37,668
Look, uh, three's a crowd.

306
00:23:40,296 --> 00:23:44,341
Here's a coupla hundred. Go to a movie
or something. Come back in a few hours.

307
00:23:44,466 --> 00:23:46,677
Leave the Mustang. I'll need it later.

308
00:24:04,028 --> 00:24:07,364
<i>(King's voice)
Lord, I don't know what will happen now.</i>

309

<i>We've got some difficult days ahead.</i>

310
00:24:10,951 --> 00:24:13,454
<i>But it really doesn't matter to me now.</i>

311
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:15,706
<i>Because I've been to the mountaintop.</i>

312
00:24:15,831 --> 00:24:17,291
<i>(people cheering)</i>

313
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:19,710
<i>And I don't mind.</i>

314
00:24:21,879 --> 00:24:26,634
<i>Like anybody, I would like to live a long life.</i>

315
00:24:26,717 --> 00:24:30,638
<i>Longevity has its place.</i>

316
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:34,058
<i>But I'm not concerned about that now.</i>

317
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:36,852
<i>I just want to do God's will.</i>

318
00:24:37,895 --> 00:24:41,565
<i>And he's allowed me
to go up to the mountain.</i>

319
00:24:41,649 --> 00:24:43,901
<i>And I've looked over.</i>

320
00:24:44,026 --> 00:24:45,819

00:26:06,817 --> 00:26:08,819
<i>And he once wrote...</i>

340
00:26:11,822 --> 00:26:15,117
<i>..."Even in our sleep,
pain which cannot forget...</i>

341
00:26:16,493 --> 00:26:18,996
<i>...falls drop by drop upon the heart...</i>

342
00:26:19,788 --> 00:26:22,750
...until in our own despair...

343
00:26:22,833 --> 00:26:26,086
...against our own will comes wisdom...

344
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,130
<i>...through the awful grace of God."</i>

345
00:26:39,016 --> 00:26:41,185
<i>(voice on tape)</i>

346
00:26:44,688 --> 00:26:47,649
<i>(siren blaring in distance)</i>

347
00:26:54,281 --> 00:26:55,491
All right, gentlemen.

348
00:26:55,574 --> 00:26:58,535
Let's make this short
so we can all go home for Christmas.

349
00:26:59,495 --> 00:27:01,413
Domestic unrest operations?

350
00:27:01,497 --> 00:27:04,666
The Anita Hill thing
has lost steam since October.

351
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:07,252
Well, let it go. We played it right.

352
00:27:07,336 --> 00:27:11,173
Unfounded allegations
will be flying around in no time. LA?

353
00:27:11,256 --> 00:27:14,051
The Rodney King trial's been moved
to Simi Valley, as you instructed.

354
00:27:14,134 --> 00:27:15,302
<i>(beeping)</i>

355
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:20,849

00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:24,812
...is set for a February vote
on independence from Yugoslavia.

357
00:27:24,895 --> 00:27:27,189
America couldn't care less.

358
00:27:27,272 --> 00:27:30,025
I'm working on next month's
Oscar nominations.

359
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:33,237
- Any preference?
- I couldn't care less.

360
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,739
But I don't want the Bills
to win the Super Bowl.

361
00:27:35,823 --> 00:27:38,242
As long as I'm alive, that doesn't happen.

362
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:41,078
Could be tough, sir.
Buffalo wants it bad.

363
00:27:41,286 --> 00:27:43,288
So did the Soviets in '80.

364
00:27:43,372 --> 00:27:45,374
You rigged the Olympic hockey game?

365
00:27:45,457 --> 00:27:48,544
What's the matter?
Don't you believe in miracles?

366
00:27:48,627 --> 00:27:53,173
The boss gave the Russian goaltender
a little pre-game good-luck pat on the back.

367
00:27:53,257 --> 00:27:56,176
Unseen Novocain needle
on a bogus wedding ring.

368
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:58,720
Goalie's a little slow on the stick side.

369
00:27:58,804 --> 00:28:00,889
Four-three, home team.

370
00:28:01,265 --> 00:28:03,058
Payback's a bitch, Ivan.

371
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:07,479
- Well, gentlemen, if that'll be all...
- One thing internally, sir.

372
00:28:07,563 --> 00:28:13,277
That "Spooky" kid who talked his way into
opening the X-Files, he feels like trouble.

373
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:16,488
He's mine to keep an eye on.

<i>(man) You'll never believe

The craft matches the dimensions

...when I was in Vietnam with the company,
that the Marines couldn't shoot down.

- Occupant?
- Critical.

401
00:31:42,611 --> 00:31:44,946
Timing couldn't be worse.

402
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:48,075
The Roswell story we concocted
was gathering momentum.

403
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:51,161
Had them all looking in the wrong direction.

404
00:31:51,244 --> 00:31:54,081
- With luck we'll get away with it.
- No luck tonight.

405
00:31:54,164 --> 00:31:57,626
Our spy planes confirm
the Russians tracked entry

406
00:31:57,709 --> 00:31:59,795
and have pinpointed touchdown.

407
00:31:59,878 --> 00:32:03,173
Haven't you heard?
There are no Russians anymore.

408
00:32:03,256 --> 00:32:08,303
Even if they're in the midst of ruin, the KGB
won't ignore an event of this magnitude.

409
00:32:08,386 --> 00:32:11,807
Nor the Chinese, nor the Germans,
nor the British...

410
00:32:11,890 --> 00:32:16,520
...or anyone with the capability
of discovering what happened here.

411
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:21,274
I'm certain each of them
has operatives advancing on us right now.

412
00:32:31,952 --> 00:32:36,206
How many historic events have only
the two of us witnessed together?

413
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:41,461
How often did we make or change history?

414
00:32:43,255 --> 00:32:45,590
And our names can never...

415
00:32:45,674 --> 00:32:48,593
...grace any pages of record.

416
00:32:48,844 --> 00:32:51,888
No monument will ever bear our image.

00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:54,891
And yet, once again, tonight...

418
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:59,813
...the course of human history
will be set by two unknown men...

419
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,816
...standing in the shadows.

420
00:33:15,453 --> 00:33:19,166
A living EBE could advance
Bill Mulder's project by decades.

421
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:25,797
Security Council Resolution 1013 states
any country capturing such an entity...

422
00:33:25,881 --> 00:33:29,968
...is responsible
for its immediate extermination.

423
00:33:33,805 --> 00:33:36,600
I'm the liar. You're the killer.

424
00:33:37,267 --> 00:33:41,229
Your lies have killed more men in a day
than I have in a lifetime.

425
00:33:41,313 --> 00:33:43,231
I've never killed anybody.

426
00:33:43,315 --> 00:33:45,483
Maybe I'm not the liar.

427
00:33:45,567 --> 00:33:50,322
I have a chance to go a lifetime
without killing anybody or any thing.

428
00:33:50,405 --> 00:33:53,533
With all of our work
in the past 30 years, all of our victories,

429
00:33:53,617 --> 00:33:56,077
if the world were to see this...

430
00:33:56,912 --> 00:34:00,415

Go ahead.

435
00:34:31,655 --> 00:34:33,198

<i>Yes, I am.</i>

00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:33,943
- How so?
- By reputation.

443
00:36:34,194 --> 00:36:37,614
Um, he's an Oxford-educated psychologist...

444
00:36:37,697 --> 00:36:43,703
...who wrote a monograph on serial killers
that helped to catch Monty Propps in 1988.

445
00:36:43,787 --> 00:36:48,083
Generally thought of as the best analyst
in the violent crimes section.

446
00:36:48,291 --> 00:36:50,960
He had a nickname at the Academy.

447
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:54,381
Spooky Mulder.

448
00:36:55,423 --> 00:36:59,636
Agent Mulder has developed
a consuming devotion...

449
00:36:59,761 --> 00:37:02,806
...to a project outside
the Bureau mainstream.

450
00:37:02,931 --> 00:37:05,225

to be suddenly so highly regarded?</i>

455
00:37:18,321 --> 00:37:21,658
<i>Who did you tick off

456
00:37:21,741 --> 00:37:24,411
<i>I'm looking forward to working with you.</i>

457
00:37:24,494 --> 00:37:26,746
<i>- I've heard a lot about you.
- Really?</i>

458
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:31,751
<i>I was under the impression

Of course. Of course.

Of course, I don't know why
anybody would wanna buy that sort of crap.

Pack of Morleys.

502
00:41:54,722 --> 00:41:57,767
Life is like a box of chocolates.

503
00:41:59,018 --> 00:42:03,022
A cheap, thoughtless, perfunctory gift
that nobody ever asks for.

504
00:42:03,106 --> 00:42:06,693
Unreturnable because all you get back
is another box of chocolates.

505
00:42:06,776 --> 00:42:10,613
So you're stuck with this undefinable
whipped-mint crap...

506
00:42:10,697 --> 00:42:14,784
...that you mindlessly wolf down
when there's nothing else left to eat.

507
00:42:14,909 --> 00:42:17,787
Sure, once in a while
there's a peanut-butter cup...

508
00:42:17,912 --> 00:42:20,623
...or an English toffee...

509
00:42:20,748 --> 00:42:24,794
...but they're gone too fast
and the taste is fleeting.

510
00:42:26,379 --> 00:42:28,798
So you end up with nothing but...

511
00:42:28,923 --> 00:42:31,134
...broken bits filled with hardened jelly...

512
00:42:31,217 --> 00:42:33,469
...and teeth-shattering nuts.

513
00:42:33,594 --> 00:42:37,473
If you're desperate enough to eat those,
all you've got left is a...

514
00:42:37,557 --> 00:42:42,478
...is an empty box
filled with useless brown-paper wrappers.

515
00:43:11,591 --> 00:43:14,093
<i>(Frohike) This is based
only on a story I read...</i>

516
00:43:14,177 --> 00:43:17,263
<i>...in one of my weekly subscriptions
that rang a few bells.</i>

517
00:43:17,346 --> 00:43:21,100
<i>I'll check on a private hacker source
who's been working on a few leads...</i>

518
00:43:21,184 --> 00:43:23,686
<i>...that could produce definitive proof.</i>

519
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:25,313
<i>And then we'll have him nailed.</i>

520
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:33,362
I can kill you whenever I please.

521
00:43:49,212 --> 00:43:50,963
But not today.

522
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,870
