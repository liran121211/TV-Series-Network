00:00:47,925 --> 00:00:49,801
Auntie Janet?

2
00:00:51,678 --> 00:00:55,098
It's time, Auntie Janet. He's waiting.

3
00:01:06,026 --> 00:01:08,862
We should hurry. We have papers to sign.

4
00:01:14,493 --> 00:01:16,912
Just tell me when.

5
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,832
Don't you cry for me, dear.

6
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:23,210
I'm tired of the pain.

7
00:01:44,898 --> 00:01:47,401
You're my angel of mercy.

8
00:01:52,281 --> 00:01:54,283
Is she gone?

9
00:01:57,703 --> 00:02:00,038
Something's wrong here.

10

(man) Vassily Peskow?

15
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:57,280
(man) Prisoner. Hey!

16
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,452
Pflsonen

17
00:04:19,428 --> 00:04:22,222
I thought maybe you were dead.

18
00:04:26,435 --> 00:04:28,979
How long have I been lying here?

19
00:04:29,062 --> 00:04:31,857
Hours. I don't know.

20
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,443
The first time is bad. Very bad.

21
00:04:39,906 --> 00:04:42,826
- They've done this to you?
- Yes.

22
00:04:42,909 --> 00:04:46,288
It becomes easier each time,
until it kills you.

23
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:48,790
What did they do to me?

24
00:04:48,874 --> 00:04:52,085
You have been exposed to the black cancer.

25
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:56,506
- What cancer?
- The cancer that lives in the rock.

26
00:05:01,094 --> 00:05:02,721
Who are you?

27
00:05:02,804 --> 00:05:05,223
I was a geologist.

28
00:05:06,141 --> 00:05:09,436
Quite well known in my field, actually...

29
00:05:09,519 --> 00:05:12,522
...but now I am just a test subject.

30
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,192
You helped them find the rock?

31
00:05:15,275 --> 00:05:18,612
I was there when they brought up
the first fragments.

32
00:05:18,695 --> 00:05:21,448
This was before the mining.

33
00:05:21,531 --> 00:05:24,618
Before we knew what lived
in Tunguska rock.

34
00:05:27,996 --> 00:05:29,915
How many men have died here?

35
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:32,292
Hundreds. Maybe more.

36
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,630
The search for a cure goes slowly.

37
00:05:37,714 --> 00:05:40,258
Is that what they say the tests are for,
to find a cure?

38
00:05:40,342 --> 00:05:43,720
No, no. They tell us nothing.

39
00:05:43,803 --> 00:05:47,807
We are left to guess or imagine
the reasons for our torture.

40
00:05:47,891 --> 00:05:50,352
But what else could it be?

41
00:05:50,435 --> 00:05:53,396
What happened to the man
who was in the cell with me - Krycek?

42
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:57,901
He is most likely dining with the men
responsible for our torture.

43
00:05:59,736 --> 00:06:02,614
I heard laughter when they left your cell.

44
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:06,743
- I'm not gonna die.
- No? Why not?

45
00:06:06,826 --> 00:06:09,913
I have to live long enough
to kill that man Krycek.

46
00:06:20,924 --> 00:06:24,386
- Where'd you get this?
- I made it... to kill myself.

47
00:06:25,428 --> 00:06:27,389
It took me nearly two weeks.

48
00:06:27,472 --> 00:06:29,766
By then I had lost the desire.

49
00:06:31,059 --> 00:06:33,520
You'd rather suffer the torture?

50
00:06:34,938 --> 00:06:39,109
It is wonderful, the persistence of life.

51
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:42,904
That rock we found buried
so deep in the earth...

52
00:06:42,988 --> 00:06:47,158
...that anything could survive
down there against all reason...

53
00:06:48,493 --> 00:06:50,620
No.

54
00:06:50,704 --> 00:06:53,206
They will have to kill me themselves.

55
00:06:56,543 --> 00:07:00,130
<i>(Scully)</i> We haven't been able to give him
anything but fluids for 48 hours.

56
00:07:00,213 --> 00:07:04,050
(man) It doesn't help that
he's in a restricted environment.

57
00:07:04,134 --> 00:07:09,764
Well, if he has been infected by some kind
of organism, we can't risk contamination.

58
00:07:09,848 --> 00:07:11,683
Are you seeing anything?

59
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:15,186
The blood in the carotid artery
looks slightly thickened...

60
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,607
...possibly due to the decreased
heart rate and blood pressure.

61
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,692
Now what's this?

62
00:07:21,693 --> 00:07:24,112
What the hell is this?

63
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:25,405
What is it?

64
00:07:25,488 --> 00:07:30,035
I don't know. It looks like
it's concentrated around his pineal body.

65
00:07:31,828 --> 00:07:35,040
- I think it's alive!
- <i>(Scully)</i> It looks like a nest.

66
00:07:35,123 --> 00:07:39,919
Some kind of black vermiform organism
attached to the pineal gland.

67
00:07:51,222 --> 00:07:54,225
- Apple?
- No. Thank you very much, though.

68
00:08:37,811 --> 00:08:40,063
- <i>(gasps)</i>
- <i>Oh,</i> pardon <i>me.</i>

69
00:08:40,522 --> 00:08:43,775
- Who are you?
- As a boy, my father had a farm...

70
00:08:44,818 --> 00:08:46,861
...but not horses like these.

71
00:08:51,408 --> 00:08:54,285
My name is Vassily Peskow.

72
00:08:54,369 --> 00:08:56,955
Mr Peskow...

73
00:08:57,038 --> 00:08:59,582
...I'm sorry, but you don't belong in here.

74
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,918
I am sorry, very sorry.

75
00:09:02,585 --> 00:09:06,798
You are going to have to leave here.
I'm going to call you a cab.

76
00:09:06,881 --> 00:09:10,051
But I have come here
to see you, Dr Charne-Sayre.

77
00:09:12,971 --> 00:09:17,809
- Do I know you?
- No. I don't know how you could.

78
00:09:19,686 --> 00:09:21,688
<i>(horses neighing)</i>

79
00:09:32,991 --> 00:09:34,701
Agent Scully.

80
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:37,704
- Sir, what...?
- I've been trying to contact you for hours.

81
00:09:37,787 --> 00:09:40,874
- The better part of a day!
- My cell phone was turned off.

82
00:09:40,957 --> 00:09:45,211
You owe me some answers - answers I don't
have to the questions I'm being asked...

83
00:09:45,295 --> 00:09:47,380
...about this missing diplomatic pouch.

84
00:09:47,464 --> 00:09:51,176
The pouch presumably carried by the man
who was pushed off my balcony...

85
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:54,971
...and whose connection to
the known felon I harboured in my house...

86
00:09:55,054 --> 00:09:59,142
...I'll have to explain to avoid perjuring
myself before a Senate subcommittee.

87
00:09:59,225 --> 00:10:02,854
Which is a serious crime in itself,
is it not, Agent Scully?

88
00:10:02,937 --> 00:10:05,106
Yes, sir. Sir, if I might explain.

89
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:12,197
The contents of that pouch - it contained
some kind of a biohazardous organism...

90
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:15,784
...that is in a contamination laboratory
at NASA Goddard...

91
00:10:15,867 --> 00:10:19,120
...which is where I've been,
trying to determine its exact nature.

92
00:10:19,204 --> 00:10:22,582
That pouch, do you know
what its intended destination was?

93
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:25,043
- No, sir, I don't.
- Well, I do, Agent Scully...

94
00:10:25,126 --> 00:10:29,172
...because I bent some rules this morning
to find out who was to receive it.

95
00:10:29,255 --> 00:10:31,966
- Who was it?
- Dr Bonita Charne-Sayre.

96
00:10:32,634 --> 00:10:36,471
- Are you familiar with that name?
- Yes, sir. She's a well-known physician.

97
00:10:36,554 --> 00:10:39,599
A virologist who's looked in on presidents.

98
00:10:39,682 --> 00:10:44,145
She's also an authority on...
on variola viruses.

99
00:10:44,229 --> 00:10:47,565
- Variola?
- Smallpox. She's been a vocal proponent...

100
00:10:47,649 --> 00:10:52,111
...of eliminating the last remaining stores
of the smallpox virus...

101
00:10:52,195 --> 00:10:56,950
...destroying the only remaining vials here
in Atlanta and in the former Soviet Union.

102
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:59,244
- Well, she was killed tonight.
- Killed?

103
00:10:59,327 --> 00:11:03,289
A horse stepped on her throat
in a riding accident in Virginia.

That's a nasty habit. It's bad for the health.

114
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:29,514
Health is the least of my concerns
at the moment.

115
00:15:29,597 --> 00:15:30,598
Yes.

116
00:15:34,352 --> 00:15:36,354
According to reports, your...

117
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:43,277
...personal physician suffered a serious
riding accident here on your property.

118

00:15:48,407 --> 00:15:51,285
If I knew, do you think
I'd be standing here talking to you?

121
00:15:51,410 --> 00:15:52,995
So...

122
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:55,581
You need me now.

123
00:15:55,706 --> 00:15:58,126
A man of my capabilities, is that it?

124
00:15:59,127 --> 00:16:01,754
This was a professional hit.

125
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:05,883
Really? And you out here
all alone and so vulnerable.

126
00:16:09,595 --> 00:16:11,973
Were you sleeping with her?

127
00:16:14,642 --> 00:16:17,937
Surely you wouldn't be so foolish
as to put the project at risk...

128
00:16:18,062 --> 00:16:21,107
...for the sake of your personal pleasures.

129
00:16:21,232 --> 00:16:23,276
Find her killer.

130
00:16:23,401 --> 00:16:27,488
- Call off this Congressional investigation.
- I can't.

131
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:31,242
But Senator Sorenson
is an honourable man.

132
00:16:32,285 --> 00:16:34,412
They are all honourable...

133
00:16:34,495 --> 00:16:37,123
...these honourable men.

134
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:47,508
I heard Mulder was captured in Tunguska.

135
00:16:52,013 --> 00:16:53,931
I hear now he's escaped.

136
00:16:57,185 --> 00:17:00,938

I would like to read
from a prepared statement.

00:19:23,789 --> 00:19:25,708
You may do so.

150
00:19:25,791 --> 00:19:30,713
"I left behind a career in medicine
to become an FBI agent four years ago...

151

...because I believed in this country."

152
00:19:33,341 --> 00:19:39,221
"I wanted to uphold its laws, to punish
the guilty and to protect the innocent."

153
00:19:39,305 --> 00:19:41,766
"I still believe in this country."

154
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:45,227
"But I believe there are powerful men
in this government who do not."

155
00:19:45,311 --> 00:19:49,231
"Men who have no respect for the law
and who flout it with impunity."

00:19:49,315 --> 00:19:50,107
Ms Scully...

"I have come to the conclusion
that it is no longer possible..."

158
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:59,325
This is not a soapbox, Ms Scully. Your
statement will be entered into the record.

159
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:01,660
With respect, I would like to finish.

160

- This is not why we are here today.
- Then why are we here, sir?

Do you or do you not know
the whereabouts of Agent Mulder?

Are you or are you not aware
of Agent Mulder's present location?

I respectfully refuse
to answer that question, sir.

164
00:20:19,011 --> 00:20:21,972
Agent Scully, you cannot refuse
to answer that question.

165
00:20:22,056 --> 00:20:25,226
I believe answering that question
could endanger Agent Mulder's life.

You are an agent of the FBI.

"..That it is no longer possible for me
to carry out my duties as an FBI agent."

Are you tendering your resignation, Agent
Scully? Is that what you're trying to say?

No, sir.

172
00:20:46,414 --> 00:20:51,460
What I am saying is that
there is a culture of lawlessness...

173
00:20:51,544 --> 00:20:54,171
...that has prevented me from doing my job.

174
00:20:54,255 --> 00:20:57,049
That the real target of this investigation...

175
00:20:57,174 --> 00:21:00,511
...should be the men who are beyond
prosecution and punishment.

176
00:21:00,594 --> 00:21:04,849
The men whose secret policies are behind
the crimes that you are investigating.

177
00:21:04,932 --> 00:21:09,979
You have a legal obligation
to answer the questions posed to you.

178
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:13,524
Tell us what you know
about Agent Mulder's whereabouts...

179
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:16,694
...or you'll be held in contempt of Congress.

180

<i>(speaks Russian)</i>

183
00:22:42,154 --> 00:22:44,198
- No Russian.
- American?

184
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:49,119
Tell your husband I'm sorry about his truck.

185
00:22:50,162 --> 00:22:51,705
The test?

186
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,874
Yeah.

187
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:57,545
- They kill everybody for the test.
- Why don't they kill you?

188
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:01,840
My husband makes deliveries.
They spare our lives.

189
00:23:01,966 --> 00:23:04,468
But now, no truck. He is afraid.

190
00:23:07,638 --> 00:23:10,307
- Well, I have to go now.
- No.

191
00:23:10,391 --> 00:23:13,185
- They'll come looking for me, and for you.
- No!

192
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:17,481
- There are other ways.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

193
00:23:18,148 --> 00:23:20,150
Grisha!

194
00:23:23,571 --> 00:23:26,365
No arm... no test.

195
00:23:27,241 --> 00:23:31,036
You don't understand. These tests,
this smallpox scar on your arm...

196
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:33,581
...it's some kind of identification.

197
00:23:33,706 --> 00:23:36,417
You have to help me escape.
I'll help you escape.

198
00:23:36,542 --> 00:23:39,545
You have to help me get to St Petersburg.

199
00:23:40,754 --> 00:23:42,339

203
00:24:59,375 --> 00:25:02,753
- You holding up?
- I've got plenty to read.

204
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:11,553
I can understand you
protecting Agent Mulder, but...

205
00:25:11,637 --> 00:25:14,723
It is not just Agent Mulder
that I am protecting, sir.

206
00:25:14,807 --> 00:25:16,183
Then what are you doing?

207
00:25:16,266 --> 00:25:20,104
We were called before this committee
to answer questions about a murder...

208
00:25:20,187 --> 00:25:23,023
...about an intercepted diplomatic pouch

209
00:25:23,107 --> 00:25:25,567
that was to be delivered
to a prominent doctor...

210
00:25:25,651 --> 00:25:29,905
...a woman who is now dead, as is the man
who was delivering the said pouch...

211
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:35,828
...the contents of which have infected
an exobiologist with a paralysing toxin.

212
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:40,082
Yet what are we stuck on here?

213
00:25:40,165 --> 00:25:44,044
- The whereabouts of Agent Mulder.
- You mean it's the wrong question.

214
00:25:44,128 --> 00:25:47,089
Several of the men
on this committee are lawyers.

215
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:50,426
It is my experience that
lawyers ask the wrong question...

216
00:25:50,509 --> 00:25:52,386
...when they don't want the right answer.

217
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:55,848
Unless Agent Mulder has found
the answers they're looking for.

218
00:25:55,931 --> 00:25:58,517
Or someone wants to make sure
he doesn't find them.

219
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:01,103
These are congressmen we're talking about.

220
00:26:01,186 --> 00:26:05,649
I know that, sir,
and it is my natural inclination to believe...

221
00:26:05,733 --> 00:26:09,903
...that they are acting
in the best interest of the truth...

222
00:26:09,987 --> 00:26:13,824
...but I am not inclined
to follow my own judgement in this case.

223
00:26:13,907 --> 00:26:17,035
So you're gonna follow Agent Mulder's.

224
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:19,121
Is that it?

225
00:27:39,368 --> 00:27:41,286
His name is Vassily Peskow.

226
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:44,623
He was a KGB Line-X stringer
working out of Moscow Centre.

227
00:27:44,706 --> 00:27:46,792
But how could this be?

228
00:27:46,875 --> 00:27:50,254
How could the Russians know
we were working on our own inoculation?

229
00:27:50,337 --> 00:27:52,965
- Six of us knew!
- Dr Charne-Sayre?

230
00:27:54,508 --> 00:27:57,970
She was trusted. Absolutely.

231
00:27:59,763 --> 00:28:01,765
Then I don't know.

232
00:28:02,599 --> 00:28:05,227
Find this man! Find him!

233
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:08,021
If my intelligence sources are right...

234
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:11,400
...I think there's someone
who might save us the trouble.

235
00:28:21,994 --> 00:28:23,996
- Mr Chairman, may I?
- Carry on.

236
00:28:26,331 --> 00:28:30,294
Miss Scully, you've had a good long time...

237
00:28:30,377 --> 00:28:33,881
...to think about the question
that was asked in our last session.

238
00:28:33,964 --> 00:28:38,302
I want to give you the opportunity
to answer that question here today...

239
00:28:38,385 --> 00:28:41,680
...so I can help our good chairman here...

240
00:28:41,763 --> 00:28:43,932
...to get on with this proceeding.

241
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:47,227
I can't answer that question, sir.

242
00:28:47,311 --> 00:28:52,316
I'm going to ask you again. Where is Special
Agent Mulder and why is he not here?

243
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,903
I'll answer your questions
about the man carrying the pouch.

244
00:28:55,986 --> 00:28:57,863
- Agent Scully!
- About his murder...

245
00:28:57,946 --> 00:29:02,534
...and my opinion about its connection
to the death of Dr Bonita Charne-Sayre.

246
00:29:02,618 --> 00:29:04,453
Miss Scully, you'll get your chance...

247
00:29:04,536 --> 00:29:09,041
- Or about the biotoxin within that pouch.
- Answer the question, Miss Scully!

248
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,544
<i>(Mulder) What is the question?</i>

249
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:21,428
<i>(gavel pounding)</i>

250
00:29:21,511 --> 00:29:24,181
All right, let's come to order.

251
00:29:24,264 --> 00:29:27,017
Agent Scully, do continue.

252
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:31,521
Yes, sir, if I may,
I would like to finish making my point.

253
00:29:31,605 --> 00:29:33,649
What is your point, Miss Scully?

254
00:29:34,358 --> 00:29:38,487
That the death of Dr Charne-Sayre,
given her field of expertise...

255
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:42,699
...suggests that she knew something
about the toxin, about its origins...

256
00:29:42,783 --> 00:29:45,202
...and that knowledge may be linked...

257
00:29:45,285 --> 00:29:50,290
...to the murder of the man in Assistant
Director Skinner's apartment building.

258
00:29:53,585 --> 00:29:54,920
Miss Scully?

259
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:57,881
Yes, sir.

260
00:29:57,965 --> 00:30:02,052
AD Skinner has informed me
that there has been an accident related...

261
00:30:02,135 --> 00:30:03,303
An accident?

262
00:30:03,387 --> 00:30:08,225
A doctor infected with the toxin has died
under suspicious circumstances...

263
00:30:08,308 --> 00:30:10,644
...involving a theft of evidence...

264
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:13,355
...of the contents of the diplomatic pouch.

265
00:30:13,438 --> 00:30:16,441
Well, we've gotten off
to a real fine start here.

266
00:30:17,693 --> 00:30:21,446
I'm going to recess now
until this new matter can be explained...

267
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:25,158
...so we might then begin
moving in a forward direction.

268
00:30:27,744 --> 00:30:29,746
Mulder...

269
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:32,666
I get to put my arms around you.

270
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:34,668
- Both of 'em.
- When did you get back?

271
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:37,212
- It's been a long, strange trip.
- Some other time.

272
00:30:37,295 --> 00:30:39,881
There's been enough strangeness here.

273
00:30:39,965 --> 00:30:43,218
I've made several connections
about what this toxin might be.

274
00:30:43,301 --> 00:30:46,346
- So have I.
- Sir, I need your permission...

275
00:30:46,430 --> 00:30:49,099
...to book two airfares
to Boca Raton, Florida.

276
00:30:49,182 --> 00:30:51,351
It shouldn't take more than 12, 15 hours.

277
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:55,564
But if it does, I need you to stall the
committee tomorrow for the purpose of...

278
00:30:55,647 --> 00:31:00,360
If you explain it to me, Agent Scully,
I'm gonna have to explain it to them.

279
00:31:00,819 --> 00:31:06,116
I suggest you do everything in your power
to make it back for tomorrow's session...

280
00:31:06,199 --> 00:31:08,201
...or I can't help you.

281
00:31:10,746 --> 00:31:12,080
Boca Raton?

282
00:31:12,164 --> 00:31:13,832
Dr Bonita Charne-Sayre
is a board member...

283
00:31:13,915 --> 00:31:19,588
...and chief physician for a chain of elder-care
convalescent hospitals around the country.

284
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:23,216
Guess what one of her patients
died of in Boca Raton?

285
00:32:02,547 --> 00:32:04,841
- Yes, what is it?
- Agents Mulder And Scully.

286
00:32:04,925 --> 00:32:08,678
We need your permission
to speak with you or any of your patients.

287
00:32:08,762 --> 00:32:10,514
- What about?
- May we come in?

288
00:32:10,597 --> 00:32:12,599
Yes.

289
00:32:14,309 --> 00:32:18,522
- When were these patients last checked?
- An hour ago, at bed check.

290
00:32:22,567 --> 00:32:24,986
- This man's dead.
- What?

291
00:32:37,624 --> 00:32:39,626
Scully!

292
00:32:40,585 --> 00:32:44,548
These people are test subjects.
I think they've been poisoned.

293
00:32:46,258 --> 00:32:48,593
Who gave these patients
their meds tonight?

294
00:32:48,677 --> 00:32:49,970
I did.

295
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:55,433
OK, call 911. Tell them you've got
a quarantine of a biohazardous material.

296
00:32:55,517 --> 00:33:01,148
Show us all of the entrances of the hospital.
We've got to seal this building immediately.

297
00:33:21,126 --> 00:33:23,587
I don't understand
what you hope to learn here.

298
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:27,924
Everything that's happened, every death
we've seen can be traced back to one man.

299
00:33:28,008 --> 00:33:31,219
But according to you, that man
is in Russia or possibly even dead.

300
00:33:31,303 --> 00:33:33,305
Well, he isn't working alone.

301
00:33:38,977 --> 00:33:41,646
Terry Edward Mayhew?
Can we talk with you?

302
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:45,275
Have a little off-the-record chat?

303
00:33:45,358 --> 00:33:47,736
- About?
- Alex Krycek.

304
00:33:48,987 --> 00:33:51,281
- Who?
- The man who set you up.

305
00:33:51,364 --> 00:33:53,992
You and the members of your militia.

306
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:56,077
Name wasn't Krycek.

307
00:33:59,581 --> 00:34:02,250
It was Arntzen or somethin' like that.

308
00:34:02,334 --> 00:34:06,671
You met him in North Dakota,
salvaging material from a missile silo.

309
00:34:06,755 --> 00:34:10,342
I never been in no missile silo.
I don't know nothin' about that.

310
00:34:10,425 --> 00:34:12,928
This man Krycek,
or "Arntzen," as you call him,

311
00:34:13,011 --> 00:34:15,639
how did he come into contact with you?

312
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:18,141
Off the record.

313
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:22,354
He came to us with some
building materials and some big ideas.

314
00:34:22,437 --> 00:34:24,856
- What was he looking to build?
- Two...

315
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:28,318
...devices.

316
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:31,613
- Did he ever mention black cancer?
- Oh, yeah.

317
00:34:33,114 --> 00:34:36,701
- What did he say?
- Developed by the Soviets.

318
00:34:36,785 --> 00:34:38,495
Saddam used it in the Gulf.

319
00:34:38,578 --> 00:34:41,706
You mean... used as biowarfare?

320
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:45,377
That's why they made
those servicemen take all them pills.

321
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,672
US government knew
about the black cancer.

322
00:34:48,755 --> 00:34:52,425
They lied. Didn't have no cure,
no inoculation.

323
00:34:56,388 --> 00:35:00,267
I think we'll quit right there.
I got nothin' more to say.

324
00:35:02,435 --> 00:35:06,231
- Let's go, Mulder.
- You said there were... two devices.

325
00:35:06,314 --> 00:35:08,608
What happened to the other bomb?

326
00:35:10,318 --> 00:35:11,945
I ate it.

327
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:14,781
- Mulder!
- You wanna know about anarchy?

328
00:35:14,906 --> 00:35:19,119
You don't tell me where that other bomb is,
I'll make sure you spend your prison time...

329
00:35:19,244 --> 00:35:21,538
...putting a big smile on some convict's face.

330
00:35:21,621 --> 00:35:23,915
Son of a bitch stole it, truck and all.

331
00:35:23,999 --> 00:35:26,543
- Some storage garage.
- Where?

332
00:35:26,626 --> 00:35:28,628
Terma, North Dakota.

333
00:35:29,921 --> 00:35:31,881
Thank you.

334
00:35:31,965 --> 00:35:37,053
Get the licence numbers for any two-ton
trucks stolen in North Dakota recently.

335
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:40,598
Have Canadian authorities
stop any vehicle fitting that description.

336
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:43,393
- Tell them they're looking for a bomb.
- What are you doing?

337
00:35:43,476 --> 00:35:45,937
This has been a big setup
from the beginning.

338
00:35:46,021 --> 00:35:48,440
Someone used Krycek, then Krycek used us.

339
00:35:48,523 --> 00:35:50,525
Someone who didn't want
that rock in US hands.

340
00:35:50,608 --> 00:35:51,943
But what's in Canada?

341
00:35:52,027 --> 00:35:56,031
Where would you put this rock
if you didn't want it to be found?

342
00:35:56,114 --> 00:35:58,033
Back in the ground.

343
00:35:59,826 --> 00:36:03,788
Feflmsen
Fertiliser for my hothouse tomatoes.

344
00:36:03,872 --> 00:36:06,207
Beautiful tomatoes all year, eh?

345
00:36:08,126 --> 00:36:10,128
Thanks.

346
00:36:46,831 --> 00:36:51,836
Go back to the refinery. See if you can
find anybody that knows about that truck.

347
00:38:43,031 --> 00:38:44,491
<i>(alarm beeping)</i>

348
00:39:10,183 --> 00:39:14,270
I would just as soon kill you,
but please don't make me.

349
00:39:14,354 --> 00:39:16,940
My work is done.

350
00:39:17,023 --> 00:39:19,025
<i>(speaks Russian)</i>

351
00:39:44,676 --> 00:39:46,678
Mulder!

352
00:39:58,606 --> 00:40:01,776
- <i>(gavel</i> pounds)
- I'd like to get started here.

353
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:04,904
- Miss Scully?
- Yes, I'm ready here, sir.

354
00:40:05,363 --> 00:40:08,992
You have evidence to present.
This is what I've been told.

355
00:40:09,075 --> 00:40:11,077
Yes, sir. Uh...

356
00:40:12,078 --> 00:40:16,040
Evidence linking a number of deaths,
a great number...

357
00:40:16,124 --> 00:40:20,753
...to a biotoxin that was
transported to US soil...

358
00:40:20,878 --> 00:40:23,047
...by a courier who was also killed.

359
00:40:23,131 --> 00:40:28,219
This was the man who was pushed
from the assistant director's apartment?

360
00:40:28,303 --> 00:40:30,305
Yes. He has not been lD'd.

361
00:40:31,431 --> 00:40:34,892
Do we have the name
of the individual who pushed him?

362
00:40:34,976 --> 00:40:40,565
Yes, sir. Alex Krycek,
who is missing and possibly deceased.

363
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:45,486
And are you then in possession
of the pouch or its contents?

364
00:40:45,903 --> 00:40:47,905
No, sir.

365
00:40:51,409 --> 00:40:54,996
What evidence are you then
presenting us with today?

366
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:57,749
Documents and interviews...

367
00:40:57,832 --> 00:41:02,879
...in support of a wide-ranging conspiracy
to control a lethal biotoxin...

368
00:41:02,962 --> 00:41:06,215
...that is, in fact, extraterrestrial.

369
00:41:06,299 --> 00:41:10,720
What, are we talking about
little green men here?

370
00:41:10,803 --> 00:41:14,515
- No, sir. Not at all.
- Why is this so hard to believe?

371
00:41:14,599 --> 00:41:17,268
When the accepted
discovery of life off this planet

372
00:41:17,352 --> 00:41:20,188
is in every newspaper worldwide?

373
00:41:20,271 --> 00:41:23,066
When even conservative scientists

374
00:41:23,149 --> 00:41:25,360
are calling for the exploration
of Mars and Jupiter?

375
00:41:25,443 --> 00:41:30,823
With every reason to believe that life is
thriving outside our own terrestrial sphere?

376
00:41:31,783 --> 00:41:34,494
If you cannot get past this...

377
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:38,331
...then I suggest this whole committee
be held in contempt...

378
00:41:38,456 --> 00:41:41,501
...for ignoring evidence
that cannot be refuted.

379
00:41:45,004 --> 00:41:47,757
This is <i>not</i> why we are here today.

380
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:50,218
Then why are we here today?

381
00:41:53,513 --> 00:41:59,227
I will suggest that we recess here until
the evidence can be properly evaluated.
