<i>(continues groaning)</i>

8
00:02:56,678 --> 00:03:00,098
- <i>(child)</i> All right, let's play some ball!
- Swing it in here.

9
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:04,436
- Strike!
- In what league?

10
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:08,732
Quit complaining. We already had to move
home plate cos you bitched about the mud.

11
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:10,275
<i>(fielder)</i> Nice <i>pitch.</i>

12
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:12,944
Come on, let him hear some chin music.

13
00:03:15,697 --> 00:03:18,116
Throw a fastball!

14
00:03:20,952 --> 00:03:21,620
Whoa.

15
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:23,622
- Nice hit.
- Go get it!

16
00:03:30,337 --> 00:03:33,965
- Hey, come on!
- It went on the Peacocks' property.

17
00:03:41,014 --> 00:03:43,475
Here's another one!

18
00:03:44,518 --> 00:03:46,978
<i>(pitcher) Come on, let's play!</i>

19
00:03:49,314 --> 00:03:53,819
Come on, baby, bring it home to Momma.
Come on, right here.

20
00:03:57,322 --> 00:04:00,492
Come on, baby. Bring it home.
Come on, right here.

21
00:04:02,994 --> 00:04:05,705
That's it. Ease up. Come on.

22
00:04:12,337 --> 00:04:13,713
<i>(fielder) Get</i> to <i>it.</i>

23
00:05:02,929 --> 00:05:08,477
Compression marks indicate the shovel
blade to be approximately 6% inches.

24
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:14,441
The deeper indentation on the right side of
the mark suggests a left-handed individual.

25
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,235
I've collected soil specimens...

26
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:21,031
...and, although numerous shoe impressions
remain from the game...

27
00:05:21,114 --> 00:05:27,245
...I think dental-stone casts
will prove invaluable to the investigation.

28
00:05:29,414 --> 00:05:32,834
And I've quit the FBI and become
a spokesperson for the Ab Roller.

29
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:37,255
Smell that. It's perfume. Eau de ball.

30
00:05:38,423 --> 00:05:41,426
God, this brings back
a lot of memories of my sister.

31
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,553
All-day games out on the vineyard...

32
00:05:43,637 --> 00:05:46,598
...ride your bikes to the beach,
eat bologna sandwiches...

33
00:05:46,681 --> 00:05:48,850
Only place you had to be on time was dinner.

34
00:05:48,934 --> 00:05:52,604
Never had to lock your doors.
No modems, no faxes, no cellphones.

35
00:05:52,687 --> 00:05:58,610
If you had to do without a cellphone,
you'd lapse into catatonic schizophrenia.

36
00:05:58,944 --> 00:06:02,989
You don't know me as well as you think.
My work demands that I live in a big city...

37
00:06:03,114 --> 00:06:06,618
...but if I had to settle down, build a home,
it'd be a place like this.

38
00:06:06,701 --> 00:06:09,329
It'd be like living in Mayberry.

39
00:06:09,788 --> 00:06:11,873
Agents Mulder and Scully?

40
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:15,460
Hi. I'm Sheriff Andy Taylor.

41
00:06:15,544 --> 00:06:16,461
For real?

42
00:06:16,545 --> 00:06:22,425
Can't thank you or the Bureau enough for
00min' out. It's just me and my deputy and...

43
00:06:22,509 --> 00:06:26,221
Hell, we never had anything of this nature.

44
00:06:26,304 --> 00:06:29,474
Do you have any thoughts or suspects?

45
00:06:29,558 --> 00:06:34,563
Population of Home is only a few hundred.
Everybody knows everybody, pretty much.

46
00:06:34,646 --> 00:06:38,066
Any local women who were pregnant
and now suddenly aren't?

47
00:06:38,358 --> 00:06:42,571
No. I just saw Mary Ellen and Nancy.
They're both doin' fine.

48
00:06:42,988 --> 00:06:44,489
Hey, Sheriff, who lives in that house there?

49
00:06:50,078 --> 00:06:52,998
Did you question them?

50
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,459
Cos they've been watchin' us.

51
00:06:56,543 --> 00:06:59,879
That farm belongs to the Peacock family.

52
00:07:00,005 --> 00:07:03,550
Three boys now - well, men.

53
00:07:03,925 --> 00:07:06,177
Guess you could call them human.

54
00:07:06,261 --> 00:07:10,432
Their folks were in a bad car wreck.
We suppose they died.

55
00:07:10,515 --> 00:07:12,517
You suppose?

56
00:07:12,934 --> 00:07:16,938
We tried to administer medical attention,
but the boys hauled the bodies away...

57
00:07:17,022 --> 00:07:18,523
...took 'em home.

58
00:07:18,607 --> 00:07:23,028
They haven't been seen in ten years,
so... we suppose they died.

59
00:07:23,111 --> 00:07:26,114
Have you questioned the men?

60
00:07:27,532 --> 00:07:31,036
The Peacocks built that farm
during the Civil War.

61
00:07:31,119 --> 00:07:35,123
It still has no electricity,
no running water, no heat.

62
00:07:35,206 --> 00:07:37,417
They grow their own food.

63
00:07:38,126 --> 00:07:42,547
They raise their own pigs.
They breed their own cows.

64
00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:48,303
Raise and breed their own stock,
if you get my meaning.

65
00:07:48,386 --> 00:07:51,640
It is, however, the closest residence
to the crime scene.

66
00:07:51,931 --> 00:07:54,476
Those boys are feeble, Agent Scully.

67
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:57,687
And sad. They wouldn't know
what you were talking about.

68
00:07:57,771 --> 00:08:01,399
- They could have witnessed...
- Look, this town is my home.

69
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:03,443
I love it.

70
00:08:03,568 --> 00:08:06,237
It's quiet. Peaceful.

71
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,115
I don't even wear a gun.

72
00:08:09,240 --> 00:08:15,914
I've seen and heard some of the sick and
horrible things that go on outside my home.

73
00:08:15,997 --> 00:08:19,501
At the same time,
I knew we couldn't stay hidden for ever.

74
00:08:19,584 --> 00:08:25,256
That one day the modern world would find us
and my home town would change for ever.

75
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,469
And when I saw... it... in the ground...

76
00:08:29,594 --> 00:08:32,097
...I knew that day had come.

77
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:35,517
Now I wanna find whoever did this.

78
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:42,065
But, in doing so, I'd like it if the way things
are around here didn't have to change.

79
00:08:42,148 --> 00:08:46,986
I know this is iffy Bureau jurisdiction,
but I didn't know where else to turn.

80
00:08:47,112 --> 00:08:51,908
So I called the Bureau in Pittsburgh,
and when I described the victim...

81
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:54,077
...they said I should see you.

82
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,121
We should take a look at the victim, then.

83
00:09:02,794 --> 00:09:05,338
We don't have a lab or a morgue.

84
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,259
I've got a room down here,
might be a bit cleaner.

85
00:09:09,342 --> 00:09:11,845
By the way, this is my deputy, Barney.

86
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:14,180
<i>- Hie'?
- Fasten!</i>

87
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:16,307
<i>(phone rings)</i>

88
00:09:25,024 --> 00:09:28,528
I could use a bit more elbow room.

89
00:09:28,653 --> 00:09:32,449
The thing is, see, folks have been
dropping in to ask about the case...

90
00:09:32,532 --> 00:09:35,076
...and I wouldn't want anybody
to pop in and see this.

91
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:39,581
- You could just lock the door to the office.
- Folks know I never lock the door.

92
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:43,376
They'd start rumours.

93
00:09:50,925 --> 00:09:52,927
Oh, my God.

94
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:57,640
Mulder, it looks as if this child...

95
00:09:57,724 --> 00:10:01,478
...has been afflicted by every
rare birth defect known to science.

96
00:10:01,561 --> 00:10:04,314
I'll have to order DNA typing
from the crime lab...

97
00:10:04,397 --> 00:10:10,570
...but there appears to be abnormalities
associated with Neu-Laxova Syndrome...

98
00:10:10,695 --> 00:10:15,241
...Meckel-Gruber Syndrome, exstrophy of the
cloaca... I don't even know where to begin.

99
00:10:15,366 --> 00:10:18,203
I guess we can rule out murder
as the cause of death, huh?

100
00:10:19,412 --> 00:10:21,456
I don't know about that.

101
00:10:27,253 --> 00:10:31,257
There's evidence of occlusion
due to dirt in the nose and mouth...

102
00:10:31,382 --> 00:10:34,385
...indicating the dirt has been inhaled.

103
00:10:34,928 --> 00:10:36,971
There's something rotten in Mayberry.

104
00:10:40,892 --> 00:10:46,564
Imagine all a woman's hopes and dreams
for her child, and then nature turns so cruel.

105
00:10:46,648 --> 00:10:49,442
What must a mother go through?

106
00:10:49,567 --> 00:10:54,155
Apparently not much in this case,
if she'd just throw it out with the trash.

107
00:10:59,619 --> 00:11:02,747
I guess I was just projecting on myself.

108
00:11:02,997 --> 00:11:06,042
Is there a history of genetic
abnormalities in your family?

109
00:11:06,125 --> 00:11:07,544
No.

110
00:11:07,627 --> 00:11:10,547
Just find a man
with a spotless genetic make-up...

111
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:16,594
...a high tolerance for being second-guessed,
and start pumpin' out the little tJber-Scullys.

112
00:11:17,929 --> 00:11:20,974
- What about your family?
- Hm?

113
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:26,521
Aside from needing corrective lenses
and being abducted by extraterrestrials...

114
00:11:26,604 --> 00:11:32,443
...involved in a governmental conspiracy,
the Mulder family passes genetic muster.

115
00:11:35,446 --> 00:11:38,366
Scully, that child inside is a tragedy.

116
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:43,371
Some young parents, probably scared kids,
disposed of an unwanted birth.

117
00:11:43,454 --> 00:11:47,625
In a very certain sense, infanticide is
involved, but this is not an FBI matter.

118
00:11:47,709 --> 00:11:50,420
From what I know about genetic defects...

119
00:11:50,503 --> 00:11:53,882
...that child isn't the result
of a single polygenic mating.

120
00:11:53,965 --> 00:11:56,259
Let the local authorities investigate that.

121
00:11:56,342 --> 00:12:00,013
Those defects
are autosomal-dominant disorders.

122
00:12:00,138 --> 00:12:04,475
And from the degree, I'd say
mutations that go back many generations.

123
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:08,938
Scully, Sheriff Taylor implied
that the boys in that family...

124
00:12:09,022 --> 00:12:11,983
...were not the type
that could easily get dates.

125
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:15,069
But he also implied
that they practise inbreeding.

126
00:12:15,153 --> 00:12:18,740
Now, we all have a natural instinct
to propagate.

127
00:12:18,823 --> 00:12:20,033
Do we?

128
00:12:20,158 --> 00:12:22,911
There are theories
which pose that our bodies...

129
00:12:22,994 --> 00:12:26,623
...are simply vehicles for genes
needing to replicate.

130
00:12:26,706 --> 00:12:32,921
Yeah, but there's no sister,
the mother's been dead for ten years...

131
00:12:33,004 --> 00:12:38,760
But if the instinct and need is strong enough,
they will answer it any way they can.

132
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:44,515
Now a woman gave birth to that child,
Mulder, and, my guess is, against her will.

133
00:12:45,391 --> 00:12:48,269
And kidnapping is a Bureau matter.

134
00:12:51,105 --> 00:12:52,690
Scully...

135
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:58,529
I never saw you as a mother before.

136
00:13:32,397 --> 00:13:34,399
<i>(fly buzzing)</i>

137
00:13:48,913 --> 00:13:51,332
No, there's no probable cause.

138
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,641
<i>(Scully) They match.</i>

139
00:14:59,484 --> 00:15:02,820
- This room alone should convict 'em.
- If we can find them.

140
00:15:02,904 --> 00:15:05,990
They probably bolted
when they saw us coming.

141
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:14,832
We'll alert Sheriff Taylor to get a warrant
for the brothers' arrest, put out an APB.

142
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:18,419
And check any prior
missing persons for a woman.

143
00:15:18,503 --> 00:15:22,173
And check the vehicle identification
number on that Cadillac.

144
00:15:22,256 --> 00:15:26,010
If the mother's alive,
they probably took her with them.

145
00:15:50,284 --> 00:15:52,286
<i>(raspy breathing)</i>

146
00:16:07,969 --> 00:16:11,556
I've issued descriptions and warrants
for George Raymond Peacock...

147
00:16:11,681 --> 00:16:13,975
<i>. . approximate age, 30, .</i> ..

148
00:16:14,058 --> 00:16:16,727
...Sherman Nathaniel Peacock,
approximate age, 26...

149
00:16:16,853 --> 00:16:19,564
...and Edmund Creighton Peacock, 42.

150
00:16:19,647 --> 00:16:23,985
- What about missing persons reports?
- Deputy Paster's on it right now.

151
00:16:24,068 --> 00:16:28,823
Do you recall recently any vehicles
you found, thought to be abandoned...

152
00:16:28,906 --> 00:16:31,325
...but which might belong to kidnap victims?

153
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:34,412
<i>We saw a white Cadillac
in the Peacocks' front yard.</i>

154
00:16:34,537 --> 00:16:36,414
We get so many of those.

155
00:16:36,539 --> 00:16:39,083
<i>A car breaks down, they move on.</i>

156
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,919
Well, we'll check on those in the morning.

157
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:43,921
You get some sleep, Sheriff.

158
00:16:44,255 --> 00:16:47,091
You too, Miss Scully. Good night.

159
00:16:52,263 --> 00:16:54,265
<i>(dog barking)</i>

160
00:18:17,431 --> 00:18:19,850
Whoa! Don't move, don't move.

161
00:18:20,518 --> 00:18:22,436
Damn.

162
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:27,775
- You still planning on making a home here?
- Nah. Not if I can't get the Knicks game.

163
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:31,279
Just as long as a brutal infanticide
doesn't weigh into your decision.

164
00:18:31,362 --> 00:18:34,657
- Good night, Mulder.
- Good night, Mom.

165
00:18:39,662 --> 00:18:42,039
Mulder, this lock is broken.

166
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:46,168
You don't have to
lock your doors around here.

<i>It's wonderful, wonderful</i>

219

Big American car.

220
00:24:20,377 --> 00:24:26,258
I, uh... I came over to give him these reports
and, uh... and found them.

221
00:24:27,509 --> 00:24:31,180
The, uh... the owner of the Cadillac was...

222
00:24:32,014 --> 00:24:34,892
...was found and contacted in Baltimore.

223
00:24:35,017 --> 00:24:38,479
She ran out of gas
and just left the car on the 119.

224
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:43,442
Other, uh... possible missing persons
are in the file.

225
00:24:43,567 --> 00:24:47,613
And, uh... this came
from Federal Crime Lab overnight.

226
00:24:48,697 --> 00:24:53,285
- Where are they?
- They're, uh... inside.

227
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:02,586
His chest is one big haematoma.

228
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:07,591
There's wood shavings embedded
in what's left of the cranium.

229
00:25:11,303 --> 00:25:13,389
They really went caveman on 'em.

230
00:25:15,391 --> 00:25:19,436
Damn it. The lab screwed up
the DNA test on the infant.

231
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:24,733
Multiple maldistribution, chromosomal
breakage, maldivision of the centromere.

232
00:25:24,817 --> 00:25:27,111
You suspected these abnormalities.

233
00:25:27,236 --> 00:25:30,072
Yeah, but this shows
far too many gene imbalances.

234
00:25:30,155 --> 00:25:31,865
It would have to be a lab error.

235
00:25:31,949 --> 00:25:35,369
This child's cells would've had
to divide triple-fold in cell metaphase.

236
00:25:35,452 --> 00:25:37,788
Triple?

237
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:47,464
Hey, Scully, what if each of the Peacock
brothers was the father of that child?

238
00:25:48,465 --> 00:25:52,386
Mulder, only one sperm in thousands
from a single individual...

239
00:25:52,469 --> 00:25:55,848
...can penetrate an ovum membrane.
Let alone from three separate males.

240
00:25:55,973 --> 00:25:59,852
What if generations of autosomal breeding
could produce such a mutation?

241
00:25:59,977 --> 00:26:04,064
No. For that to be possible, there'd have
to be a weakening of the ovum...

242
00:26:04,148 --> 00:26:09,153
...and that would be from a female member
of the Peacock family. And there aren't any.

243
00:26:10,654 --> 00:26:13,657
Well, in any case,
they haven't ventured too far from home.

244
00:26:13,782 --> 00:26:16,452
We should request backups
from Pittsburgh and pick 'em up.

245
00:26:16,535 --> 00:26:19,747
That would take a whole day.
They may have a woman captive up there...

246
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:23,250
...who may have sustained
life-threatening injuries while giving birth.

247
00:26:23,333 --> 00:26:26,420
Who knows what those men
have done to her. We should go there now.

248
00:26:26,503 --> 00:26:29,339
We're outnumbered.
We could further endanger the victim.

249
00:26:29,465 --> 00:26:32,551
I'll take you out there.

250
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:36,180
Then it's three against three. And this...

251
00:26:38,015 --> 00:26:40,392
This should give us the advantage.

252
00:26:42,478 --> 00:26:46,064
That was just a little bit
too Chuck Bronson for me, Scully.

253
00:26:46,190 --> 00:26:48,442
Hang on a second, Mulder. Why...

254
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:52,780
Why would they kill Sheriff Taylor? He didn't
even question them about the buried child.

255
00:26:52,863 --> 00:26:55,657
They probably heard about
the warrants for their arrest.

256
00:26:55,741 --> 00:26:59,578
But how would they know?
He issued the warrants by phone.

257
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:02,372
Unless they heard us talking about it,
how would they know?

258
00:27:02,498 --> 00:27:06,835
- We searched that house. They weren't home.
- Exactly. How could they know?

259

264
00:28:12,484 --> 00:28:14,862
They'll be comin' now.

265
00:28:14,945 --> 00:28:18,490
We knew this day was gonna happen.

266
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:22,411
That they'd try to change the way things are.

267
00:28:22,494 --> 00:28:25,539
All we can do about changin' things...

268
00:28:25,622 --> 00:28:27,791
...is be ready for it.

269
00:28:28,584 --> 00:28:30,586
Be ready for <i>them.</i>

270
00:28:31,086 --> 00:28:34,172
Let 'em know this is our home...

271
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,135
...and this is the way it's gonna stay.

272
00:29:19,301 --> 00:29:21,053
<i>(Scully) Yup, they're up there.</i>

273
00:29:21,553 --> 00:29:26,558
I'll take the front. Their attention'll be taken by
the uniform. You can approach around back.

274
00:29:29,019 --> 00:29:32,064
Are these vests absolutely necessary,
Deputy?

275
00:29:32,189 --> 00:29:34,316
I've seen 'em fire muskets before.

276
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,486
I, for one, am not gettin' taken out
by some antique.

277
00:30:12,020 --> 00:30:15,899
- This is Paster. I'm at the front of the house.
- We're getting into position.

278
00:30:47,973 --> 00:30:49,599
I don't see anybody inside.

279
00:30:49,725 --> 00:30:51,268
I'm going in.

280
00:31:19,296 --> 00:31:20,756
Paster, no!

281
00:31:29,181 --> 00:31:33,143
Paster's dead. The brothers moved in
like a pack of animals.

282
00:31:33,810 --> 00:31:36,271
The eldest will move in
to ensure the prey is dead.

283
00:31:36,354 --> 00:31:40,108
Encircling the prey is a signal
to the others that it's safe to approach.

284
00:31:40,192 --> 00:31:43,153
What we're witnessing
is undiluted animal behaviour.

285
00:31:43,278 --> 00:31:47,324
Mankind, absent in its own creation of
civilisation, technology and information...

286
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:50,077
...regressed to an almost prehistoric state...

287
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:54,164
...obeying only
the often savage laws of nature.

288
00:31:55,165 --> 00:31:58,752
We're invading the den, trying to take
away their one chance at reproducing.

289
00:31:58,835 --> 00:32:00,796
Which we're gonna do.

290
00:32:00,879 --> 00:32:04,674
Even though we have the firearms,
I imagine the place is rigged with traps.

291
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,011
Yeah, but we can try
and divert them out of the house.

292
00:32:30,408 --> 00:32:35,997
Scully, would you think less of me as a man
if I told you I was kind of excited right now?

293
00:32:36,081 --> 00:32:39,876
There some secret farmer trick
to gettin' these things moving?

294
00:32:41,378 --> 00:32:44,089

00:37:20,698 --> 00:37:22,826
What about her?

321
00:37:22,909 --> 00:37:25,328
She's not going anywhere.

322
00:37:26,704 --> 00:37:29,082
We may not be able to remove her, Mulder.

323
00:37:29,165 --> 00:37:33,128
She doesn't appear to be held against
her will. I mean, I don't believe she is.

324
00:37:33,211 --> 00:37:35,630
I'm sure she's an accessory.

325
00:37:35,713 --> 00:37:38,842
We're only assuming.
We can't prove anything.

326
00:37:42,345 --> 00:37:48,184
The way I think it goes here is that Edmund
is the brother and father of the other two.

327
00:37:48,268 --> 00:37:53,565
So when Edmund was a kid, he could ground
the other two for playing with his things?

328
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:57,652
The brothers killed three people.
Tell her we're gonna bring them in.

329
00:37:57,735 --> 00:38:02,407
And convince her that she's the one way
they can get out of this without getting hurt.

330
00:38:02,532 --> 00:38:05,410
I'm gonna keep an eye on them.

331
00:38:05,535 --> 00:38:07,620
Scully, watch your step.

332
00:38:07,704 --> 00:38:09,956
This place is rigged.

333
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:40,111
Mrs Peacock?

334
00:38:42,447 --> 00:38:47,744
Mrs Peacock, you are
in immediate need of medical attention.

335
00:38:48,411 --> 00:38:50,955
Agent Mulder and I are here to help you.

336
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:54,125
This is our home. Why leave it?

337
00:38:54,334 --> 00:38:58,004
- Whatever pain you may be in...
- I don't feel pain.

338
00:38:58,505 --> 00:39:01,090
Runs in the family.

339
00:39:01,174 --> 00:39:04,928
Have to check the boys,
see if they hurt themselves.

340
00:39:06,262 --> 00:39:09,432
What about you? Even after the accident?

341
00:39:10,183 --> 00:39:12,936
Right arm was torn off.

342
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:17,607
Saw it sittin' there
across my dead husband's lap.

343
00:39:18,107 --> 00:39:20,652
Boys took me home...

344
00:39:20,777 --> 00:39:25,782
...sewed me up, just like the family learnt
in the War of Northern Aggression.

345
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,663
Whole time, felt the same
as if been makin' breakfast.

346
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,669
They're such good boys.

347
00:39:38,044 --> 00:39:43,383
Mrs Peacock, they murdered Sheriff Taylor
and his wife and Deputy Paster.

348
00:39:45,176 --> 00:39:49,347
I can tell you don't have no children.

349
00:39:50,181 --> 00:39:53,184
Maybe one day you'll learn...

350
00:39:53,309 --> 00:39:55,228
...the pride...

351
00:39:55,311 --> 00:39:57,397
.ihelove,“

352
00:40:00,024 --> 00:40:04,362
...when you know your boy
will do anythin' for his mother.

353
00:40:21,004 --> 00:40:22,505
Scully.

354
00:40:27,010 --> 00:40:29,012
Federal agent! I'm armed!

355
00:40:31,764 --> 00:40:33,725
Stop or I'll fire!

356
00:40:34,684 --> 00:40:35,518
Mulder!

357
00:40:56,873 --> 00:40:58,458

358
00:41:03,588 --> 00:41:05,381
<i>(glass shatters)</i>

359
00:41:13,556 --> 00:41:15,099
I've got the mother!

360
00:41:17,727 --> 00:41:19,562
<i>(yelling)</i>

361
00:41:23,066 --> 00:41:24,651

362

<i>(brother groans)</i>

363
00:41:33,743 --> 00:41:36,579
Where's the other brother? Edmund?

364
00:41:37,955 --> 00:41:40,041
Mulder, look.

365
00:41:40,124 --> 00:41:42,752
Marks on the floor.

366
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:01,437
(Mulder) I looked everywhere. They're gone.

367
00:42:01,521 --> 00:42:05,650
I've notified the state police and
the highway patrol. They've put out an APB...

368
00:42:05,775 --> 00:42:09,654
...and are setting up a roadblock
over a 30-mile radius.

369
00:42:09,779 --> 00:42:11,948
In time, we'll catch 'em.

370
00:42:12,949 --> 00:42:16,035
I think time already caught them, Scully.

371

<i>(music on car radio)</i>

372
00:42:29,716 --> 00:42:34,095
<i>(Mrs Peacock)</i> There, there.
Sherman and George were good boys.

373
00:42:34,178 --> 00:42:36,097
We should be proud.

374
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:40,935
And you got to know, Edmund,
you can't keep a Peacock down.

375
00:42:41,018 --> 00:42:43,104
There'll be more.

376
00:42:43,187 --> 00:42:46,441
One day, there'll be more.

377
00:42:46,524 --> 00:42:48,943
Now we have to move on...

378
00:42:49,026 --> 00:42:51,112
...start a new family.

379
00:42:51,195 --> 00:42:53,281
One we'll be proud of.

380
00:42:53,364 --> 00:42:56,284
Find a new place to call ours.

381
00:42:56,367 --> 00:42:58,244
A new home.

382
00:42:58,327 --> 00:43:00,913
A brand-new home.

383
00:43:01,164 --> 00:43:03,416
<i>Wonderful...</i>

384
00:43:03,499 --> 00:43:08,629
<i>Oh, so wonderful, my love</i>

385
00:43:08,713 --> 00:43:12,425
<i>And I say to myself</i>

386
00:43:12,508 --> 00:43:17,096

387
00:43:17,180 --> 00:43:21,976
