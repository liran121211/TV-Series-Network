- How do I know you're for real?

I can explain everything.

12
00:03:57,697 --> 00:04:00,742
First I want you to come

I want you to come with me

Who?

42
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:52,255
Your government men will be
at the hospital with your mother.

43
00:11:52,338 --> 00:11:57,051
What can they do? They can't stop us
without exposure, without consequence.

44
00:11:57,176 --> 00:12:00,388
You have to understand something.
I must perish.

45
00:12:00,513 --> 00:12:02,432
The consequences to that end...

46
00:12:02,515 --> 00:12:07,270
...are incalculable
to the preservation of the larger plan.

47
00:12:07,353 --> 00:12:10,023
The larger plan?

48
00:12:11,524 --> 00:12:13,443
You mean colonisation?

49
00:12:13,526 --> 00:12:17,655
Hegemony, Mr Mulder.
A new origin of species.

50
00:12:17,739 --> 00:12:19,741
- I don't understand.
- I can show you.

51
00:12:19,866 --> 00:12:24,162
My mother is dying.
I need to take you to see her right now.

52
00:12:24,245 --> 00:12:26,164
And if they are waiting for us...

53
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:30,001
...if they're willing to kill me
and face the consequences...

54
00:12:30,084 --> 00:12:33,838
...to stand before your ineffectual
justice system, I will be dead.

55
00:12:33,922 --> 00:12:36,424
I won't be able to save your mother.

56
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:40,386
The work will go on.
The plan will continue to be executed.

57
00:12:42,722 --> 00:12:44,849
- Or you can stop it.
- How can I stop it?

58
00:12:44,933 --> 00:12:49,604
I can take you to a place, show you
the work in progress, where you can see...

59
00:12:49,729 --> 00:12:53,566
- No! There's no time.
- ..where you can see your sister.

60
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,710
- He isn't coming.
- I told you.

61
00:13:12,794 --> 00:13:15,755
- Then where is he?
- I don't know.

62
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,883
Certainly he anticipated we'd be here waiting.

I've come in receipt of some pictures...
of your visit to Mrs Mulder's summerhouse.

67

Were you aware
you were being photographed?

68
00:13:36,609 --> 00:13:38,444
BY Whom?

69
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:43,116
I believe that can be determined
by a simple planting of information...

70
00:13:44,158 --> 00:13:46,953
...to see where that information flows.

71
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:49,122
What information?

72
00:13:50,248 --> 00:13:53,751
That Mrs Mulder's life is in danger.

73
00:13:53,835 --> 00:13:58,798
That, left unprotected,
she may come to an unnatural end.

- Are you OK, Scully?
- Yes, I'm fine.

81

- About 20 miles.

Maybe half that on foot over those hills.

00:15:37,772 --> 00:15:39,357
Let's go.

95
00:15:53,913 --> 00:15:56,415
- Sir?
- Agent Scully.

96
00:15:56,582 --> 00:15:59,001
I heard you were looking for me.

97
00:15:59,085 --> 00:16:01,504
There's been concern
about you and Agent Mulder.

98
00:16:01,671 --> 00:16:06,634
We're fine, sir. We've been searching
for this man, Jeremiah Smith.

99
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:09,011
- Did you find him?
- No.

100
00:16:13,683 --> 00:16:17,478
I received a memo from you
that there's more confusion about this man.

101
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:22,483
Social Security Administration has five men
with this name working in branch offices...

102
00:16:22,608 --> 00:16:25,361
...with identical photo IDs.

103
00:16:25,444 --> 00:16:30,491
We ran a check on these men. All five
have not reported to work in three days.

104
00:16:30,616 --> 00:16:34,203
Would you or Agent Mulder let me in
on what your suspicions are?

105
00:16:34,287 --> 00:16:38,040
I'm afraid we haven't exactly formulated
any clear suspicions, sir.

106
00:16:38,124 --> 00:16:41,294
- Well, we have, Agent Scully.
- Sir?

107
00:16:41,961 --> 00:16:43,796
We downloaded the hard-drive data...

108
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,716
...from each of the five
missing men's workstations.

109
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:51,053
We found an enormous amount
of files and data that cannot be identified...

110
00:16:51,137 --> 00:16:54,432
...do not correspond with any kind
of document collection...

111
00:16:54,515 --> 00:16:56,976
...done as normal departmental business.

112
00:16:57,059 --> 00:16:59,645
The data was all locked in password files.

113
00:16:59,729 --> 00:17:03,816
- How much of it is there?
- Enough to fill seven 10GB hard drives...

114
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,651
...roughly a billion entries.

115
00:17:05,735 --> 00:17:09,530
It appears to be some kind of
personal recordkeeping or accounting.

116
00:17:09,655 --> 00:17:14,327
- Could it be some kind of cryptogram?
- If it is, I can't crack it.

117
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:18,789
I'd like to get a copy of a portion of this.
I might be able to figure it out.

118
00:17:18,873 --> 00:17:22,251
- Seriously?
- Maybe. There's someone I want to run it by.

119
00:17:22,335 --> 00:17:24,962
- Agent Mulder?
- No.

120
00:17:25,046 --> 00:17:29,091
I think, sir, this is more
along my field of expertise.

121
00:17:54,617 --> 00:17:56,160
What happened to this man?

122
00:17:56,244 --> 00:17:58,913
I wouldn't touch the body, Mr Mulder.

123
00:18:14,804 --> 00:18:17,223
There's a work order here.

124
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:19,892
It's for yesterday.

125
00:18:22,603 --> 00:18:25,314
He's only been here
a little more than 24 hours.

126
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:31,737
You know what killed him, don't you?

127
00:18:33,072 --> 00:18:35,324
It's not much further.

128
00:18:57,763 --> 00:19:00,599
You're looking at the future, Mr Mulder.

129
00:19:04,937 --> 00:19:08,107
- What is it?
- A flowering shrub.

130
00:19:09,442 --> 00:19:13,779
But its specific epithet can't be found
on any of your taxonomic charts.

131
00:19:15,489 --> 00:19:18,326
- Being grown for what?
- Pollen.

132
00:19:27,543 --> 00:19:29,545
What is this?

133
00:19:31,672 --> 00:19:34,467
- What's going on here?
- What did I tell you?

134
00:19:34,884 --> 00:19:37,178
That looks just like my sister.

135
00:19:40,514 --> 00:19:44,477
But that's not possible.
She's no older than the day she was taken.

136
00:19:49,565 --> 00:19:51,484
Samantha?

137
00:19:55,321 --> 00:19:56,364
Samantha?

138
00:19:59,158 --> 00:20:01,035
Samantha?

139
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:04,497
Samantha?

140
00:20:06,165 --> 00:20:07,500
Samantha?

141
00:20:08,667 --> 00:20:10,669
Samantha, it's me.

142
00:20:12,588 --> 00:20:14,840
It's me, Fox, your brother.

143
00:20:20,179 --> 00:20:22,890
Do you remember me?

144
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:28,229
- What's wrong with her?
- She has no language.

145
00:20:29,522 --> 00:20:34,402
- What do you mean?
- She's a drone, Mr Mulder. A worker.

146
00:20:37,405 --> 00:20:39,323
What are you talking about?

147
00:20:39,407 --> 00:20:43,202
There's more you should see
so that you might understand.

148
00:21:15,568 --> 00:21:17,111
How'd they get here?

149
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:21,240
They're stationed here.
They're part of an agrarian workforce.

150
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:26,036
- Who takes care of 'em?
- They take care of themselves.

151
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,915
Parenting is unnecessary,
a needless division of energy.

152
00:21:49,143 --> 00:21:52,438
- They're clones.
- Serial ovotypes.

153
00:21:53,147 --> 00:21:57,526
Have you seen enough?
We can't stay around here much longer.

154
00:22:00,654 --> 00:22:03,866
I'll go see if I can find some gas.

155
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:47,743

- I've been trying to reach Agent Mulder.

158
00:23:13,435 --> 00:23:16,313
I watched you enter the building.
Where is he?

159
00:23:16,397 --> 00:23:17,815
I don't know.

160
00:23:17,898 --> 00:23:21,277
I have information
that would concern him greatly.

161
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,154
- Concern him how?
- Concerning his mother.

162
00:23:24,238 --> 00:23:28,075
- Has something happened to her?
- No. No, not yet.

163
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,580
- Is she in danger?
- I prefer to speak with Agent Mulder directly.

164
00:23:32,705 --> 00:23:35,457
Let me just say she is unprotected.

165
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,585
From whom?

166
00:23:38,544 --> 00:23:40,588
From whom?

167
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:45,926
If you want to involve yourself, you'd do well
to give this information to your partner.

168
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:49,305
Not until you give me some information first.

169
00:23:52,308 --> 00:23:55,019
These are data entries

- You're going in the wrong direction.
- All beginning with the letters S-E-P.

171
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:05,821
You know what these are. Confirm or deny.

00:24:11,452 --> 00:24:12,786
Smallpox.

174
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:16,624
Don't unlock doors
you're not prepared to go through.

175
00:24:16,749 --> 00:24:20,502
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Leave it alone.

176
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:23,505
Protect the mother.

177
00:24:32,264 --> 00:24:33,599
What are you doing?

178
00:24:33,682 --> 00:24:37,269
- She's coming with us.
- You can't do this. She's not your sister.

179
00:24:37,353 --> 00:24:39,521
Well, then who is she?

180
00:24:39,605 --> 00:24:45,194
You have a chance here to understand
something so much greater, to expose it.

181
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:48,781
Then explain it to me. Explain it to me now!

182
00:24:49,114 --> 00:24:50,616
<i>(tyres screech)</i>

183
00:25:28,696 --> 00:25:30,072
<i>(buzzing)</i>

184
00:25:30,155 --> 00:25:32,491
- Bees.
- It's an apiary.

185
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:35,911
- Are bees what killed that man we found?
- Yes.

186
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:37,871
Not a good idea to hide in there.

187
00:25:37,996 --> 00:25:40,708
- No. You have no immunity to them.
- But you do?

188
00:25:59,351 --> 00:26:01,770
Somebody lead me. I can't see anything.

189
00:26:27,379 --> 00:26:29,590
Is that the only way out?

190
00:26:36,305 --> 00:26:38,390
We've walked into our own trap.

191
00:28:06,478 --> 00:28:08,188
Come on!

192
00:28:17,656 --> 00:28:18,907
<i>(screams)</i>

193
00:28:38,802 --> 00:28:40,888
- Busy, Agent Pendrell?
- No, I was just...

194
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:44,266
Good. I think I've made
some headway on this data.

195
00:28:44,349 --> 00:28:48,770
- Can you call up the files?
- Yeah. I've gotten nowhere.

196
00:28:48,854 --> 00:28:51,440
SEP. Smallpox Eradication Program.

197
00:28:51,523 --> 00:28:53,525
Smallpox? How'd you figure that?

198
00:28:53,609 --> 00:28:56,904
I got lucky. But the key
is in this first string of letters.

199
00:28:56,987 --> 00:28:59,489
<i>(Pendrell) 20 letter strings, 30 variations.</i>

200
00:28:59,573 --> 00:29:01,533
A 20-letter code to any scientist...

201
00:29:01,617 --> 00:29:05,537
...means protein-amino acid sequence code,
which is what this is.

202
00:29:05,621 --> 00:29:08,707
- Protein sequence code for what?
- Cowpox virus.

203
00:29:08,790 --> 00:29:12,085
The virus used to inoculate
humans against smallpox.

204
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:16,965
OK. Right. So these guys were keeping
records of smallpox inoculations. Why?

205
00:29:17,215 --> 00:29:19,384
I haven't worked that out yet.

206
00:29:19,468 --> 00:29:23,889
But the big question is
this second alphanumeric string: 15 digits.

207
00:29:23,972 --> 00:29:28,352
Yeah. I checked. Each one is different.
An infinite number of variations.

208
00:29:28,602 --> 00:29:31,688
- An inventory.
- Of what?

209
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:33,982
Of us.

210
00:29:37,861 --> 00:29:43,659
With all due respect, Agent Scully, it looks
like something from the Hubble Telescope.

211
00:29:43,742 --> 00:29:48,580
Actually, it's an image created
by what's called a confocal microscope.

212
00:29:48,664 --> 00:29:52,501
You're looking at a 3-D picture
of the location of a protein.

213
00:29:52,584 --> 00:29:55,462
In this case,
cowpox structural protein number six.

214
00:29:55,545 --> 00:29:59,257
It's one of the inoculants
used in the smallpox vaccine.

215
00:29:59,341 --> 00:30:01,843
- Where'd it come from?
- From me.

216
00:30:01,927 --> 00:30:07,099
I had a biopsy taken from the smallpox
vaccination scar on my upper arm.

217
00:30:07,182 --> 00:30:09,977
Through immunohistochemical staining...

218
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:14,231
...and the addition
of an antibody for the cowpox virus six...

219
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:18,068
...I was able to get this picture
of the location of a protein.

220
00:30:18,151 --> 00:30:21,238
A single, nonrandom protein pattern.

221
00:30:21,321 --> 00:30:24,074
I'm not a scientist,
and I don't know that many...

222
00:30:24,157 --> 00:30:27,828
What I'm saying is that
I think this protein is a tag.

223
00:30:28,912 --> 00:30:34,459
A genetic marker, applied to me when
I was inoculated against smallpox as a child.

224
00:30:34,543 --> 00:30:36,545
Why you?

225
00:30:36,837 --> 00:30:39,172
Notjust me. All of us.

226
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:45,345
Quite possibly anybody who's been
inoculated over the past 50 years.

227
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:52,352
Agent Scully, this sounds like something
we might have expected from Agent Mulder.

228
00:30:52,936 --> 00:30:56,356
I had my doubts. And I'm still not certain.

229
00:30:57,482 --> 00:31:00,610
But I performed the same procedure
on Agent Pendrell.

230
00:31:04,531 --> 00:31:09,453
The location of the protein from his biopsy
should be identical to mine...

231
00:31:09,536 --> 00:31:14,541
...but it's slightly different. Which might
correspond to the alphanumeric entries...

232
00:31:14,624 --> 00:31:18,170
...collected by the men
at the Social Security Administration.

233
00:31:18,253 --> 00:31:23,383
So what you're saying is we're being
catalogued, tagged and inventoried?

234
00:31:23,467 --> 00:31:25,969
- By who?
- I don't know.

235
00:31:26,053 --> 00:31:28,221
It would have to be a government agency.

236
00:31:28,305 --> 00:31:31,475
- And to what purpose?
- I don't know that either.

237
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:36,855
I think the only man who might be able to
give us that information is Jeremiah Smith.

238
00:31:42,527 --> 00:31:46,782
Agent Scully, can I see you outside
for a moment? Alone.

239
00:31:58,126 --> 00:32:00,420
Do you realise what you're promoting?

240
00:32:00,504 --> 00:32:03,340
You're rounding these people up
to imply that there's...

241
00:32:03,423 --> 00:32:07,886
I am a scientist, sir.
What I'm promoting is reductive evidence.

242
00:32:07,969 --> 00:32:11,556
It's the reason I was assigned
to the X-Files, is it not?

243
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:14,976
To put Agent Mulder's work
to the test of science?

244
00:32:15,060 --> 00:32:16,186
<i>(phone rings)</i>

245
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:18,772
Excuse me.

246
00:32:19,773 --> 00:32:20,732
Scully.

247
00:32:20,816 --> 00:32:22,692
Where are you right now?

248
00:32:23,693 --> 00:32:25,737
In Skinner's office. Where are you?

249
00:32:25,821 --> 00:32:29,116
In Canada, but I'm catching a plane soon.
Meet me on the other end.

250
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:30,450
Just tell me where.

251
00:32:30,534 --> 00:32:33,495
<i>- At the hospital where my mother is.
- Mulder, I don't...</i>

252
00:32:33,578 --> 00:32:36,206
Her life depends on me
and my party getting there.

253
00:32:36,289 --> 00:32:37,290
<i>Who?</i>

254
00:32:37,374 --> 00:32:40,627
<i>Jeremiah Smith. And someone else.</i>

255
00:32:42,045 --> 00:32:43,964
I'm gonna need some protection.

256
00:32:44,047 --> 00:32:47,551
- Believe me, you'll have it.
- <i>What</i> do you mean?

257
00:32:47,634 --> 00:32:50,512
There's a lot of people who
wanna talk to Jeremiah Smith.

258
00:32:51,513 --> 00:32:52,889
They'll get their chance.

259
00:32:52,973 --> 00:32:55,809
<i>- (tyres screech)
- We'll be there.</i>

260
00:33:09,156 --> 00:33:11,741
Please. You can't kill him. He can't die.

261
00:33:12,409 --> 00:33:14,995
- He must.
- That girl is my sister.

262
00:33:15,203 --> 00:33:20,083
He shows you pieces, but tells you nothing
of the whole. He's inconsequential...

263
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:22,419
...a traitor to the project.

264
00:33:22,502 --> 00:33:24,421
Kill me. Let them go.

265
00:33:24,504 --> 00:33:27,465
- You'd trade your life for his?
- For my mother's.

266
00:33:33,054 --> 00:33:35,307
Everything dies.

You have no way to get hold of him?

274

This is beginning to seriously compromise
our ability to treat patients.

I can't. There's nothing...

278
00:34:35,242 --> 00:34:38,662

- What happened?

279
00:34:54,219 --> 00:34:56,346
She'll never know.

As long as she's lying here,
you can't give up on her.

289

I don't care what the doctors say.

290
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:21,324
I had one chance... and I let it slip away.

291
00:37:22,826 --> 00:37:27,747
You don't know that, Mulder. You can't blame
yourself for what you could only hope.

292
00:37:29,374 --> 00:37:32,210
He took me to a place with green fields...

293
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:36,756
...and I saw my sister.

294
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:41,886
She was just a little girl.

295
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:49,269
I've seen too many things not to believe.

296
00:37:50,395 --> 00:37:52,439
I've seen things, too.

297
00:37:54,232 --> 00:37:57,068
But there are answers to be found now.

298
00:37:57,902 --> 00:38:02,198
We have hope that there's a place to start.
That's what I believe.

299
00:38:02,532 --> 00:38:06,286
You put such faith
in your science, Scully, but...

300
00:38:07,704 --> 00:38:11,082
...the things I've seen,
science provides no place to start.

301
00:38:11,416 --> 00:38:17,464
Nothing happens in contradiction to nature,
only in contradiction to what we know of it.

302
00:38:18,548 --> 00:38:20,425
And that's a place to start.

303
00:38:21,426 --> 00:38:23,761
That's where the hope is.

304
00:38:32,770 --> 00:38:34,814
I feel I came so close.

305
00:38:36,316 --> 00:38:38,902
I feel it, too.

306
00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:41,738
I know it.

307
00:38:41,821 --> 00:38:44,908
- How?
- I was warned.

<i>Who I believe knows the truth.</i>

<i>Who can lead us to a place to start.</i>

311
00:39:49,681 --> 00:39:51,641
Mr Mulder?

312
00:39:52,809 --> 00:39:57,063
My name is Marita Covarrubias.
I'm assistant to the Special Representative.

313
00:39:57,188 --> 00:39:59,607
Was he able to review
the material I sent him?

314
00:39:59,691 --> 00:40:02,694
- Yes.
- And will he see me?

315
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:06,531
I'm afraid he's been called
into something important.

316
00:40:06,656 --> 00:40:10,076
- Can I ask who sent you here, Mr Mulder?
- A friend.

317
00:40:10,827 --> 00:40:15,206
I've been asking Special Representatives
all month about the farmland in Canada.

318
00:40:15,331 --> 00:40:18,835
I've been trying to get answers
and all I've gotten are dead ends.

319
00:40:18,918 --> 00:40:24,048
I can tell you that farm has been abandoned.
The crops you described were left to die.

320
00:40:24,173 --> 00:40:27,260
But they have been identified as ginseng.

321
00:40:27,385 --> 00:40:31,264
No evidence of beehives
or bee husbandry was found.

322
00:40:32,849 --> 00:40:35,101
I know it's not the answer you wanted.

323
00:40:35,226 --> 00:40:37,770
No. I, uh...

324
00:40:39,022 --> 00:40:41,858
Can I ask why this is so important to you?

325
00:40:44,736 --> 00:40:49,866
I've suffered... I've suffered
some very personal losses recently and...

326
00:40:54,412 --> 00:40:57,040
...I was... I was hoping...

327
00:40:59,751 --> 00:41:01,794
...that, um...

328
00:41:17,435 --> 00:41:20,104
Not everything dies, Mr Mulder.

329
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:53,429
I need to know the reasons
why this should be.

330
00:41:53,513 --> 00:41:56,182
So that the work may continue.

331
00:41:57,809 --> 00:42:03,272
So that the project may proceed unabated
by removing an unnecessary obstacle.

332
00:42:03,815 --> 00:42:07,318
- What obstacle?
- Agent Mulder, actually.

333
00:42:10,446 --> 00:42:12,865
If his mother were to die, he would...

334
00:42:13,700 --> 00:42:15,702
He what?

335
00:42:15,827 --> 00:42:21,457
You see, the fiercest enemy
is the man who has nothing left to lose.

336
00:42:23,793 --> 00:42:27,338
And you know how important
Agent Mulder is to the equation.
