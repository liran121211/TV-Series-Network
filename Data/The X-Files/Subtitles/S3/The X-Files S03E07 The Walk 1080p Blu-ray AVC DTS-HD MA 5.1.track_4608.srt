1
00:00:07,593 --> 00:00:10,929
I reviewed your case
and your service record.

2
00:00:11,763 --> 00:00:14,224
Combat duty in Panama, Grenada.

3
00:00:14,308 --> 00:00:16,810
Distinguished service in the Gulf.

4
00:00:16,935 --> 00:00:19,897
Great triumphs and great tragedies.

5
00:00:20,814 --> 00:00:23,984
It's clear to me that
these suicide attempts are...

6
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:26,486
Cries for help!

7
00:00:26,612 --> 00:00:30,199
You've tried and failed to kill yourself
three times in as many weeks.

8
00:00:30,282 --> 00:00:33,660
- Frankly, if you wanted to...
- You don't understand.

9
00:00:33,785 --> 00:00:36,038
He won't let me.

10
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:40,292
- He won't let me die!
- Who? Who won't let you die?

11
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,144
Just relax a moment. I'll be back
with something to help you sleep.

12
00:01:55,325 --> 00:01:57,494
Stand down, Lieutenant Colonel!

13
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,085
No! Not this time!

14
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:07,879
<i>(screams)</i>

15
00:02:08,005 --> 00:02:10,465
Just let me go!

16
00:02:10,549 --> 00:02:12,676
Oh, my God!

17
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:23,228
- Where is he?
- (nurse) Down here. He's in there.

18
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,545
I told ya. He won't let me die.

19
00:03:44,643 --> 00:03:47,354
I don't wanna talk about it any more.

20
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:50,732
I told them and I told them,
but they won't listen.

21
00:03:50,816 --> 00:03:53,777
- You mean they don't believe you.
- No, sir.

22
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:57,823
You said that at the time of the accident
you believe somebody was in the room.

23
00:03:57,948 --> 00:04:01,243
It was no accident. Don't you understand?

24
00:04:01,326 --> 00:04:04,538
But this person saved your life. Is that right?

25
00:04:04,663 --> 00:04:07,165
Look at me. Look!

26
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:11,253
I have no life. He took it all away.

27
00:04:11,336 --> 00:04:13,713
Do you have any idea who it is?

28
00:04:13,839 --> 00:04:16,508
I never see him clearly.

29
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:20,387
But he looks like a soldier.
Always standin' at attention.

30
00:04:20,512 --> 00:04:23,723
- GI?
- Or one of Saddam's boys...

31
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:26,685
...come back to hold me accountable.

32
00:04:27,185 --> 00:04:29,855
Whoever it is, he knows my name.

33
00:04:30,355 --> 00:04:32,399
He speaks to you?

34
00:04:32,858 --> 00:04:35,902
"Your time has come" he said.

35
00:04:37,154 --> 00:04:40,073
Then he started takin' it all away.

36
00:04:40,198 --> 00:04:43,368
- What did he start taking away?
- Everything.

37
00:04:45,704 --> 00:04:48,373
My wife. My children.

38
00:04:49,374 --> 00:04:52,002
- And how did he do that?
- How did...

39
00:04:54,212 --> 00:04:56,882
He burned them alive.

40
00:04:57,007 --> 00:04:59,759
Now he makes me suffer.

41
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:02,846
Because he won't let me die.

42
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:08,393
Agents Mulder and Scully?
May I have a word with you?

43
00:05:18,361 --> 00:05:21,907
I've been asked to have you suspend
the investigation you've begun.

44
00:05:22,032 --> 00:05:24,326
- Asked by whom?
- General Callahan...

45
00:05:24,409 --> 00:05:27,829
- ...Stans's commanding officer.
- Is something wrong?

46
00:05:27,913 --> 00:05:30,832
Criminal investigation of military personnel

47
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:34,252
is to be conducted
through military channels.

48
00:05:34,377 --> 00:05:38,048
- We didn't sign in at the front desk?
- You're in breach of procedure.

49
00:05:38,131 --> 00:05:42,010
Excuse me, but does General Callahan
have a superior officer?

50
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:42,969
Ma'am?

51
00:05:43,094 --> 00:05:46,056
If we wanted to investigate him,
who would we talk to?

52
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:49,267
- Investigate him for what?
- Whatever.

53
00:05:49,392 --> 00:05:53,188
- General Callahan <i>is</i> the senior officer here.
- We'd like to speak to him.

54
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:57,442
- I don't know that he's available.
- Ask him to make himself available.

55
00:05:57,567 --> 00:06:01,112
In the meantime, we'll finish up
with Lieutenant Colonel Stans.

56
00:06:01,238 --> 00:06:05,116
You never know when he might
try and kill himself again.

57
00:06:10,247 --> 00:06:12,749
<i>(Scully) Let's finish this, Mulder.</i>

58
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:34,396
<i>(man)</i> I keep havin' the same dream
almost every night.

59
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,567
I know a lot of crips have the same dream:
the walk.

60
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:41,945
In my dream I rise up outta my chair.
I can stand.

61
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:45,240
And I look down the hallway.

62
00:06:45,323 --> 00:06:50,412
Only I'm not in the ward any more.
I'm at home. There's my baby girl.

63
00:06:50,495 --> 00:06:55,625
Without even thinkin' about it, I take
a step towards her and I take another step.

64
00:06:55,709 --> 00:06:59,879
Then I pick her up and I carry her
outside on my own two feet.

65
00:07:00,672 --> 00:07:04,509
Outside is my little boy. We run together.

66
00:07:04,634 --> 00:07:07,846
Running! Me! My legs!

67
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:10,223
Like they were before.

68
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:16,313
We play a little bit of football. I show him
a few moves. Like the old man used to do.

69
00:07:16,396 --> 00:07:19,024
We just walk home.

70
00:07:19,149 --> 00:07:21,276
No crutches, no wheelchairs.

71
00:07:21,359 --> 00:07:25,572
I know I'll never walk again,
but this dream just seems so real.

72
00:07:25,697 --> 00:07:27,782
I can't help but think that maybe someday...

73
00:07:27,866 --> 00:07:29,659
<i>(laughs)</i>

74
00:07:29,909 --> 00:07:32,704
Don't hold your breath!

75
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:35,790
We'd all be interested in your point of view,
Leonard.

76
00:07:35,874 --> 00:07:40,378
Oh, you really wanna know what I think?
I pity all you guys. I really do.

77
00:07:40,503 --> 00:07:44,674
With your handicapped basketball
and your wheelchair races.

78
00:07:44,758 --> 00:07:48,136
- You all act like we're normal people.
- We are normal people.

79
00:07:48,219 --> 00:07:50,972
I don't know if you've had
a look in the mirror lately, my friend,

80
00:07:51,056 --> 00:07:54,351
but you are missing a leg.

81
00:07:54,434 --> 00:07:56,561
Aagh!

82
00:07:57,062 --> 00:08:00,732
I don't have any!
Where... where did my arms go?

83
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,528
- We all know how you feel.
- No, you don't.

84
00:08:05,612 --> 00:08:08,615
How the hell could you
possibly know how I feel?

85
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:12,577
There's only one way you could ever know,
and I can only pray to God...

86
00:08:12,702 --> 00:08:14,621
...that he'll take your legs
and your arms away

87
00:08:14,704 --> 00:08:19,084
and give you a little taste
of what it feels like!

88
00:08:22,754 --> 00:08:24,881
Roach.

89
00:08:33,932 --> 00:08:36,726
I'm sorry, gentlemen. Let's begin again.

90
00:08:40,897 --> 00:08:43,483
- What is it, Roach?
- What's what?

91
00:08:43,608 --> 00:08:47,153
You got that "I'm freakin' out" look
on your face. What's the matter?

92
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:51,157
- It's nothing.
- I spent two years with you in a gun turret.

93
00:08:51,282 --> 00:08:55,036
I know when you got somethin' on your
mind. Private, make your report.

94
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,375
It's the FBI, man. They're downstairs.
They're askin' questions about the LC.

95
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,461
To hell with the feds.
All right, Roach? You hear me?

96
00:09:03,586 --> 00:09:06,464
To hell with them. Just forget about 'em.

97
00:09:10,802 --> 00:09:12,679
(woman) General.

98
00:09:12,804 --> 00:09:14,973
Sir?

99
00:09:15,098 --> 00:09:18,768
- Agents Mulder and Scully to see you, sir.
- Thank you, Captain.

100
00:09:18,852 --> 00:09:21,438
- (Mulder) General.
- I've had the captain...

101
00:09:21,521 --> 00:09:23,940
...contact the Justice Department
and let them know

102
00:09:24,023 --> 00:09:27,068
about the FBl's gross misconduct here.

103
00:09:27,152 --> 00:09:29,571
So this isn't a good time
to thank you for seeing us.

104
00:09:29,654 --> 00:09:32,741
Let me assure you,
this matter will not go unaddressed.

105
00:09:32,824 --> 00:09:36,911
I would hope not, considering the extremity
of Lieutenant Colonel Stans' case.

106
00:09:36,995 --> 00:09:39,080
What case? There's no case.

107
00:09:39,164 --> 00:09:42,041
- Stans is a very sick man.
- Yes, so we gathered.

108
00:09:42,167 --> 00:09:45,795
But his file is missing important facts
which came out in our interview.

109
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:49,340
I'm sure everything germane
to Stans' situation is on file.

110
00:09:49,466 --> 00:09:55,305
Except for any mention of the death of
his family in a house fire three months ago.

111
00:09:55,889 --> 00:10:00,143
- Well, it was a tragic accident.
- No doubt. But there is no record...

112
00:10:00,226 --> 00:10:04,981
- ...of any criminal or arson investigation.
- Stans tried to save his family that night.

113
00:10:05,064 --> 00:10:09,527
According to him, he was prevented from
doing so by some kind of phantom soldier.

114
00:10:09,652 --> 00:10:12,030
Look, I've known Stans a long time

115
00:10:12,113 --> 00:10:14,449
and there's no doubt
that he has suffered terribly.

116
00:10:14,532 --> 00:10:17,243
Not unlike Staff Sergeant Kevin Aiklen.

117
00:10:17,327 --> 00:10:20,580
You knew Sergeant Aiklen.
Isn't that correct, sir?

118
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:22,665
He served under me in the Gulf, yes.

119
00:10:22,749 --> 00:10:26,628
Six months ago Aiklen also
lost his family to a house fire.

120
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:30,006
He received psychiatric treatment
for delusional behaviour.

121
00:10:30,089 --> 00:10:32,884
He said he wanted to die
but somebody wouldn't let him.

122
00:10:33,009 --> 00:10:36,179
Before throwing himself
into a woodchipper.

123
00:10:36,262 --> 00:10:41,434
Unless that's procedure, the coincidence
of detail has been strangely overlooked, sir.

124
00:10:41,559 --> 00:10:44,729
Hold on. Just who's under suspicion here?

125
00:10:47,357 --> 00:10:51,110
Look, I make no excuses
for the sadness of these men's lives.

126
00:10:51,236 --> 00:10:56,407
They are casualties of war. Once brave men
who we can do little but feel sorry for.

127
00:10:56,533 --> 00:10:59,911
If you think there's more to it,
you are seriously mistaken.

128
00:11:00,036 --> 00:11:01,830
That's your conclusion.

129
00:11:01,913 --> 00:11:06,084
But I'd hope you'd allow us
the opportunity to come to our own.

130
00:11:19,764 --> 00:11:22,308
You really think he's got something to hide?

131
00:11:22,392 --> 00:11:26,020
No. I think he's got everything to hide.

132
00:11:26,104 --> 00:11:29,107
You don't think he's closing ranks
to protect his men?

133
00:11:29,232 --> 00:11:35,363
I know it's not what drew you to this case,
but I think it's clear what's going on here.

134
00:11:35,446 --> 00:11:36,739
What's that?

135
00:11:36,823 --> 00:11:41,619
The general is protecting his men from
prosecution for the murder of their families.

136
00:11:41,744 --> 00:11:44,289
- Why would he do that?
- I don't know.

137
00:11:44,414 --> 00:11:47,417
- But I can think of several reasons.
- They were his soldiers...

138
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,086
...and he feels responsible for the tragedies?

139
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:51,671
That could be one.

140
00:11:51,754 --> 00:11:53,840
He may know the secrets to their madness:

141
00:11:53,965 --> 00:11:59,012
...the biological weapons they were exposed
to during the war. The cause of the effect.

142
00:11:59,137 --> 00:12:02,640
Considering the government's
disavowal of Gulf War Syndrome...

143
00:12:02,765 --> 00:12:07,145
...I'd say it's a pretty good reason
to prevent our investigation.

144
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,980
But you're not buying it.

145
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:10,732
What I can't figure out is why a man

146
00:12:10,815 --> 00:12:13,192
who deliberately set out
to commit suicide...

147
00:12:13,318 --> 00:12:16,696
...would leave the one entrance
to the room unsecured.

148
00:12:16,821 --> 00:12:21,826
Then again, I obviously have a feeble grasp
of army protocol and procedure.

149
00:12:24,662 --> 00:12:25,955
<i>(knocking)</i>

150
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:28,166
Come in.

151
00:12:30,501 --> 00:12:34,547
I want to apologise, sir. I didn't mean
to put you on the spot like that.

152
00:12:34,672 --> 00:12:38,968
I know that, Captain.
This whole situation is unfortunate.

153
00:12:39,052 --> 00:12:42,430
- Is there anything more I can do?
- No. Go home and get some rest.

154
00:12:42,513 --> 00:12:44,933
We'll deal with it in the morning.

155
00:12:45,016 --> 00:12:47,518
Relax, Captain. That's an order.

156
00:12:48,853 --> 00:12:50,980
Yes, sir.

157
00:13:14,212 --> 00:13:16,714
Your time has come, Killer.

158
00:13:27,225 --> 00:13:29,519
<i>(answering machine beeps)</i>

159
00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:32,563
<i>(distorted voice)</i>

160
00:13:40,238 --> 00:13:43,032
<i>(distorted voice continues)</i>

161
00:15:55,414 --> 00:15:59,585
(Callahan) All right, that'll be fine.
Thank you, gentlemen.

162
00:16:06,551 --> 00:16:08,636
General Callahan.

163
00:16:08,719 --> 00:16:13,182
One of the detectives is saying
Captain Draper's death wasn't accidental.

164
00:16:13,266 --> 00:16:18,855
There are bruises around her neck and her
shoulder roughly the size of fingermarks.

165
00:16:18,938 --> 00:16:22,191
- Someone drowned her?
- The bruises and surrounding oedema...

166
00:16:22,275 --> 00:16:24,944
...are consistent with a struggle.

167
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:31,367
- Will you be contacting her family?
- She had no family.

168
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:34,078
The army was her family.

169
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:36,706
I'm sorry. Truly.

170
00:16:39,792 --> 00:16:41,169
I talked with security.

171
00:16:41,252 --> 00:16:44,839
Other than Draper, they saw
no one enter the pool and no one leave.

172
00:16:44,922 --> 00:16:50,094
- The officers are saying she was drowned.
- General, do you have a family of your own?

173
00:16:50,219 --> 00:16:53,097
- Yes. Why?
- If the pattern we've seen is consistent...

174
00:16:53,222 --> 00:16:57,518
- ...you and your family may be in danger.
- Based on what? The death of my adjutant?

175
00:16:57,602 --> 00:17:01,272
Just keep an eye on 'em.
Watch out for anything out of the ordinary.

176
00:17:01,397 --> 00:17:03,691
- You're serious?
- This is a military base.

177
00:17:03,774 --> 00:17:06,777
They've got security everywhere
and no one heard a thing.

178
00:17:06,903 --> 00:17:11,115
It's not so hard to believe. Her screams
would have been muffled underwater.

179
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:14,744
It also fits the MO of Lieutenant
Colonel Stans's phantom killer.

180
00:17:14,827 --> 00:17:17,997
Agent Mulder, what did you mean by that?

181
00:17:18,915 --> 00:17:23,878
- It was just a word to the wise, sir.
- No, I mean "anything out of the ordinary".

182
00:17:23,961 --> 00:17:27,632
Any unusual or unexplained phenomena.

183
00:17:30,134 --> 00:17:33,012
Last night I saw someone in my office.

184
00:17:33,971 --> 00:17:37,266
He said my name,
but when I turned around he was gone.

185
00:17:37,350 --> 00:17:39,936
Then my phone machine
went all snaky again.

186
00:17:40,019 --> 00:17:44,774
- Again? It's happened before?
- No, not what I saw.

187
00:17:44,857 --> 00:17:48,277
But the phone calls, yes.
Twice before, at my home.

188
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:07,296
Mom! Mail's here!

189
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:16,347
Mom! Mom!

190
00:18:17,181 --> 00:18:19,225
Mom! Mom!

191
00:18:19,892 --> 00:18:22,311
- Mom!
- What is it?

192
00:18:22,395 --> 00:18:25,022
- What is it, honey?
- Mom, there was a man here.

193
00:18:25,147 --> 00:18:27,191
Who?

194
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:01,809
Thank God! I was trying to reach you.
Trevor saw someone in the house.

195
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:04,061
- Just a few minutes ago.
- Is he all right?

196
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:07,231
He's in his room, but he's terrified.
I'm shaking, myself.

197
00:19:07,356 --> 00:19:11,319
- Frances, these people are with the FBI.
- Is it about the break-in?

198
00:19:11,402 --> 00:19:14,530
- Check on Trevor. I'll be right up.
- Why? What's happening?

199
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:17,700
Frances, please. We'll talk upstairs.

200
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:25,082
This way.

201
00:19:25,207 --> 00:19:27,251
<i>(distorted voice)</i>

202
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:35,801
It just comes on.
The phone doesn't even ring.

203
00:19:35,926 --> 00:19:38,429
At first I thought it was a prank.

204
00:19:42,141 --> 00:19:45,603
- Did you save the other ones?
- No. I erased 'em.

205
00:19:56,489 --> 00:20:00,576
I even called the phone company,
had them check the line.

206
00:20:00,659 --> 00:20:03,954
They checked the whole house.
They couldn't find anything wrong.

207
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:06,540
Have you noticed any other type
of electronic interference,

208
00:20:06,624 --> 00:20:09,168
like the radio or the television?

209
00:20:09,293 --> 00:20:11,337
No. Not a thing.

210
00:20:12,505 --> 00:20:15,674
There's someone in the backyard.

211
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,636
I saw someone out here. I'm sure of it.

212
00:20:22,807 --> 00:20:24,934
Look.

213
00:20:27,436 --> 00:20:30,272
You better call the police, General.

214
00:20:35,194 --> 00:20:38,489
You're gonna feel a little stick here.

215
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,664
<i>(nurse) There. That's fine.</i>

216
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:51,043
(nurse) I'll be back in a minute.

217
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:04,014
That was too close, man. Too close.
I ain't doin' it any more, you understand?

218
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,809
- What?
- I said I ain't doin' it any more.

219
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:12,398
You owe me, Roach. I wouldn't be
in this damn chair if it wasn't for you.

220
00:21:13,524 --> 00:21:15,443
Hey!

221
00:21:15,526 --> 00:21:17,695
This isn't about you and me, man.

222
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:22,741
This is about all the grunts and all the crips
and all the boys who came home in a box!

223
00:21:22,867 --> 00:21:25,744
The enemy must be defeated,
and we're gonna do it.

224
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:29,915
You're gonna do your part
and I'm gonna do mine.

225
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:32,376
Nurse!

226
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:34,462
Hey!

227
00:21:34,545 --> 00:21:37,715
What do you do, man,
when I rap on the tank?

228
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,718
- Get some, get some, fire at will.
- Good.

229
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:44,096
You're all right.

230
00:21:45,931 --> 00:21:47,975
Nurse! Come on!

231
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:50,102
This is killin' me here!

232
00:21:55,524 --> 00:21:59,236
(nurse) What a mess.
You've got to learn to sit still.

233
00:21:59,904 --> 00:22:02,615
How about you never do it right?!

234
00:22:04,408 --> 00:22:06,911
There. That'll hold it.

235
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:23,677
Find anything?

236
00:22:23,761 --> 00:22:26,388
No, but I'm really beginning to like the tune.

237
00:22:26,472 --> 00:22:29,934
Whoever's targeted the general
didn't just leave footprints.

238
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:33,812
- They left fingerprints as well.
- Really? Where?

239
00:22:33,938 --> 00:22:36,398
Forensics lifted two indexes and a thumb.

240
00:22:36,482 --> 00:22:38,067
One on the mailbox next to the front door

241
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:41,320
and one on the door
leading to the backyard.

242
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:44,949
- We'd better go run 'em.
- They're on their way to the NCIC.

243
00:22:54,291 --> 00:22:57,127
FBI! Open the door!

244
00:22:58,462 --> 00:23:01,006
- Hands up! Hands over your head!
- Don't shoot!

245
00:23:01,131 --> 00:23:03,259
- Turn around!
- OK, OK.

246
00:23:03,342 --> 00:23:06,929
Put your hands down
behind your back. Cuff him.

247
00:23:07,012 --> 00:23:09,557
You are under arrest
for suspicion of murder.

248
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:11,183
You have the right to remain silent.

249
00:23:11,267 --> 00:23:16,981
Anything you say can be held against you
in a court of law. If you want an attorney...

250
00:23:47,553 --> 00:23:51,098
Captain Janet Draper.
Staff Sergeant Kevin Aiklen.

251
00:23:51,181 --> 00:23:56,145
- Lieutenant Colonel Victor Stans.
- General and Mrs Thomas Callahan.

252
00:23:56,228 --> 00:23:58,731
We've got him, Mulder.

253
00:24:25,257 --> 00:24:27,760
Watch your left flank there.

254
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:30,387
OK.

255
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:00,751
Trevor? Hey, Trevor!

256
00:25:15,099 --> 00:25:18,477
We have enough evidence to place you
at each of the crime scenes.

257
00:25:18,602 --> 00:25:22,606
In addition to accessory to murder,
you're looking at conspiracy...

258
00:25:22,731 --> 00:25:25,651
- ...commission of a felony...
- Can I get a cigarette?

259
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:29,738
We know you weren't acting alone, Quinton.
We know you had an accomplice.

260
00:25:29,822 --> 00:25:32,324
How did he do it, Quinton?

261
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:37,162
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- How did he get past the guard?

262
00:25:37,287 --> 00:25:39,998
How did he kill him?
Trevor was only eight years old!

263
00:25:40,124 --> 00:25:42,960
I don't know. I didn't kill anybody.

264
00:25:43,085 --> 00:25:45,587
I'm just the mailman.

265
00:25:45,671 --> 00:25:48,841
What does that mean,
you're just the mailman?

266
00:25:49,967 --> 00:25:52,010
Rappo's mailman.

267
00:25:54,304 --> 00:25:57,433
- Leonard Trimble, right?
- If that's the man they call Rappo.

268
00:25:57,516 --> 00:25:59,727
Well, that's him. What's he done?

269
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:02,229
He's a suspect in two homicides.

270
00:26:02,312 --> 00:26:05,816
Rappo?
You must be making some kind of mistake.

271
00:26:05,941 --> 00:26:08,444
- How's that?
- There.

272
00:26:09,153 --> 00:26:12,948
See for yourself. He's a quadruple amputee.

273
00:26:14,032 --> 00:26:15,617
Dammit!

274
00:26:15,701 --> 00:26:18,245
- He lied to us.
- He said he was the mailman.

275
00:26:18,328 --> 00:26:21,415
- What did he mean?
- I don't know. I'm adding it to the list.

276
00:26:21,498 --> 00:26:25,169
- Are you coming?
- No. I'll catch up with you later.

277
00:27:01,205 --> 00:27:05,209
(Quinton) He knows this place.
He can find me here!

278
00:27:06,668 --> 00:27:09,129
He knows this place!

279
00:27:09,213 --> 00:27:12,674
He's been here before! I'm not safe here!

280
00:27:12,758 --> 00:27:16,303
- (guard) Hey! Keep it down in there!
- Let me outta here!

281
00:27:16,386 --> 00:27:19,348
He's gonna kill me! I'm a dead man!

282
00:27:19,431 --> 00:27:22,601
Let me out! Let me out!

283
00:27:22,726 --> 00:27:24,770
I'm not gonna tell you again.

284
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,397
He's gonna kill me!

285
00:27:31,276 --> 00:27:34,530
He's here! He's here!

286
00:27:44,873 --> 00:27:49,795
You don't wanna get him started again.
He was pretty worked up about an hour ago.

287
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:52,923
<i>(Scully)</i> Not as worked up as I'm gonna be.

288
00:27:56,718 --> 00:27:59,221
Visitor. On your feet.

289
00:28:01,223 --> 00:28:03,767
Problem. Wait.

290
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,705
- How'd it happen?
- The sheet was stuffed down his throat.

291
00:28:24,788 --> 00:28:27,207
- Nobody'd been in?
- He did it all by himself.

292
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:29,084
- Not likely.
- Not likely?

293
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:33,005
He had help, Scully. I think the man
that killed him was Leonard Trimble.

294
00:28:33,130 --> 00:28:36,425
Rappo? He can't even walk,
let alone kill somebody.

295
00:28:36,508 --> 00:28:40,470
- See this? This is a dental x-ray plate.
- You've had it since we got here.

296
00:28:40,596 --> 00:28:44,683
The ones I've been walkin' around with
I already had developed at the hospital.

297
00:28:44,808 --> 00:28:48,687
This is the one I had when we first met
Stans, this one in the rehab room...

298
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:53,609
...in the pool, the general's office, his house.
All exposed to some kind of radiation.

299
00:28:53,692 --> 00:28:56,153
From what?

300
00:28:57,321 --> 00:29:02,701
From Stans's phantom soldier. I came down
here wondering if what Stans described...

301
00:29:02,826 --> 00:29:05,412
...was a case of astral projection.

302
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:09,374
You're saying Rappo is leaving his body
and floating around killing people?

303
00:29:09,499 --> 00:29:14,755
Practitioners claim that the astral body can
detach itself and float virtually anywhere...

304
00:29:14,838 --> 00:29:18,258
...sometimes invisible,
but sometimes appearing as an apparition.

305
00:29:18,342 --> 00:29:22,763
They claim that it has psychokinetic
capabilities greater than the corporeal body.

306
00:29:22,846 --> 00:29:27,017
Mulder!
Then why would he need Quinton Freely?

307
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:31,396
Maybe he needs a psychic connection
to a place. A thing or an object. A letter.

308
00:29:31,521 --> 00:29:34,274
- Quinton called himself the mailman.
- It's insane.

309
00:29:34,358 --> 00:29:38,320
Sometimes the only sane response
to an insane world is insanity.

310
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:43,575
- Know anything about backwards masking?
- Messages recorded backwards in songs?

311
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:48,163
Yeah. Or on the general's
answering machine. Check this out.

312
00:29:48,246 --> 00:29:50,374
<i>(distorted voice)</i>

313
00:29:53,502 --> 00:29:57,714
<i>Your time has come, Killer.
Your time has come.</i>

314
00:30:00,258 --> 00:30:02,552
<i>(music and singing on TV)</i>

315
00:30:13,355 --> 00:30:16,233
- Leonard Trimble?
- No, it's Fred Astaire.

316
00:30:17,609 --> 00:30:21,196
Mr Trimble, we'd like to ask you
a few questions about Quinton Freely.

317
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,324
Roach? What's he done now?

318
00:30:24,408 --> 00:30:26,535
He's dead.

319
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:28,996
Oh.

320
00:30:29,079 --> 00:30:32,541
- Well... serves him right.
- How's that?

321
00:30:32,624 --> 00:30:35,711
He's only the guy
who turned me into second base

322
00:30:35,794 --> 00:30:38,213
by gettin' my arms and legs blown off.

323
00:30:38,296 --> 00:30:42,634
- Other than that, he was a real good guy.
- Then Why'd you kill him?

324
00:30:42,759 --> 00:30:46,471
- What's wrong with this picture?
- We read your medical records.

325
00:30:46,596 --> 00:30:51,143
We know you've refused all efforts at
rehabilitation, even prosthetic limbs.

326
00:30:51,268 --> 00:30:55,564
- Maybe I don't want any of that crap.
- Maybe because you don't need it.

327
00:30:55,647 --> 00:31:00,110
Because you can leave your body any time
you want, kill anybody you wanna kill.

328
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:04,281
If I could leave my body now, I could think
of somethin' else I'd rather be doin'.

329
00:31:04,406 --> 00:31:09,536
Like kill General Callahan's boy? Lieutenant
Colonel Stans's family? Sergeant Aiklen?

330
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:13,582
- You're a real trip.
- Because I figured you out? You're a soldier.

331
00:31:13,665 --> 00:31:16,585
You knew what you were
gettin' into when you enlisted.

332
00:31:16,668 --> 00:31:20,964
- Why you wanna blame your COs?
- I blame 'em for what happened to all of us!

333
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:23,884
You don't know what it was like.

334
00:31:23,967 --> 00:31:29,139
You sat at home and watched the war
on cable TV like it was a damn video game.

335
00:31:30,182 --> 00:31:33,769
You had no idea about the guys that died,
about the blood in the sand.

336
00:31:33,852 --> 00:31:36,146
What it feels like when a hit comes.

337
00:31:37,022 --> 00:31:39,441
The thing is, you just don't care, do ya?

Just change that station, right?

Killer got his prime time,
LC got his fancy little medals.

340
00:31:48,784 --> 00:31:51,661
Now take a good look at me.
What did I get?!

341
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:56,208
Nobody knows how I feel.

342
00:31:57,375 --> 00:32:00,170
They took my life away.

343
00:32:00,837 --> 00:32:03,173
Yeah. So you took theirs.

344
00:32:05,133 --> 00:32:07,385
If I only could.

345
00:32:08,386 --> 00:32:13,767
Now, if you're through questioning me,
I'd like to get a little shuteye.

346
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:16,770
No sleepwalkin'.

347
00:32:16,853 --> 00:32:20,398
That's good. I haven't heard that one yet.

348
00:32:20,524 --> 00:32:22,818
Hardy-har-har.

349
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:37,415
- What do you wanna do?
- Warn Callahan to stay out of his house.

350
00:32:56,893 --> 00:32:59,020

351
00:33:09,030 --> 00:33:11,283
Honey, leave that.

No, I know how it upsets you when his...
toys are spread all over the place.

353
00:33:21,376 --> 00:33:24,546
We can handle this, Frances.

354
00:33:24,629 --> 00:33:27,132
I don't wanna handle this.

355
00:33:27,924 --> 00:33:30,427
