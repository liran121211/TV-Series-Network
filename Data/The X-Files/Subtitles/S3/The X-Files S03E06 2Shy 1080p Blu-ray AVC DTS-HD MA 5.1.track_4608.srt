2
00:00:11,763 --> 00:00:14,183
- That's a little hard to believe.
- Really?

3
00:00:14,266 --> 00:00:17,060
No, I'm pretty much of a homebody.

4
00:00:17,144 --> 00:00:19,271
But all that changed.

5
00:00:20,022 --> 00:00:23,775
Just from your words,
the way you saw things...

6
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:26,987
...I knew I wanted to meet you.

7
00:00:28,447 --> 00:00:31,575
Well, I hope you're not too disappointed.

8
00:00:31,658 --> 00:00:36,371
Lauren, we have a real connection.
Which is rare.

9
00:00:38,457 --> 00:00:40,334
Most men don't feel that way.

10
00:00:40,417 --> 00:00:43,670
Most men don't know what they're missing.

11
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,506
What?

12
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:50,010
I can't believe this.

13
00:00:50,135 --> 00:00:53,597
I mean,
I can't believe that after three months...

14
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,683
...we finally meet in person and you're...

15
00:00:56,808 --> 00:01:01,146
I don't know,
I'm just really enjoying myself tonight.

16
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,565
0h, no! on!

17
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:06,151
Here, let me help you.

18
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,199
My sister gave it to me.
For good luck, I guess.

19
00:01:12,991 --> 00:01:17,412
Kind of dopey, huh? I mean, a clover leaf.

20
00:01:17,496 --> 00:01:19,581
How blatant can you get?

21
00:01:28,215 --> 00:01:30,342
It's beautiful.

22
00:01:33,512 --> 00:01:35,180
Thank you.

out on the lakefront at Erie and Capitol...</i>

29
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:10,460
We're not certain, but from the driver's
licence we suspect it's Lauren Mackalvey.

30
00:04:10,544 --> 00:04:14,714
- I want you to get on it.
- All right, we'll check this out.

31
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:23,056
Agent Mulder? Alan Cross, Cleveland PD.
Thanks a lot for coming out so quickly.

32
00:04:23,181 --> 00:04:25,559
This is my partner, Dana Scully.

33
00:04:25,934 --> 00:04:28,687
We found the purse
in the front seat of that car.

34
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:32,357
According to the licence,
her name is Lauren Mackalvey.

35
00:04:32,441 --> 00:04:35,819
But... we're not sure yet
that this is her body.

36
00:04:35,902 --> 00:04:37,279
You're not sure?

37
00:04:37,362 --> 00:04:40,031
We couldn't make a positive ID, considering.

38
00:04:43,869 --> 00:04:47,122
Wendy Sparks, our Bureau liaison,
thought this would be...

39
00:04:47,205 --> 00:04:49,708
...closer to your area of expertise.

40
00:04:50,876 --> 00:04:53,211
Any indication as to the cause of death?

41
00:04:53,295 --> 00:04:57,466
We were just lucky to get her into the bag
without her body falling apart.

42
00:04:57,549 --> 00:05:01,052
This substance. Did you find it
anywhere else in the car?

43
00:05:02,053 --> 00:05:06,057
- On the carpet or the upholstery?
- As a matter of fact, no.

44
00:05:06,892 --> 00:05:11,062
- So, it was only on the victim's body?
- That's what it looks like.

45
00:05:13,899 --> 00:05:15,775
Why?

46
00:05:16,234 --> 00:05:19,779
- Do you have an idea what happened here?
- No. Not yet.

47
00:05:21,781 --> 00:05:25,452
We'll call you when we find
anything else concrete.

48
00:05:25,577 --> 00:05:28,246
- Detective?
- Yeah, sure. Call me.

49
00:05:44,763 --> 00:05:47,098
Mulder, what do you think it is?

50
00:05:47,682 --> 00:05:51,269
A couple of months ago a case
came my way from the Mississippi office.

51
00:05:51,353 --> 00:05:53,939
Four Aberdeen women
had disappeared within a month.

52
00:05:54,022 --> 00:05:56,399
- Disappeared?
- Only one victim was found...

53
00:05:56,483 --> 00:05:59,778
...but her body was too decomposed
to perform a viable autopsy.

54
00:05:59,861 --> 00:06:03,073
- What we just saw was not decomposition.
- I know.

55
00:06:03,156 --> 00:06:07,494
- I want you to run this by the coroner.
- What about you? Where are you going?

56
00:06:07,619 --> 00:06:10,872
I'm gonna try to find out
if Lauren Mackalvey was a lonely heart.

57
00:06:10,956 --> 00:06:14,751
All the Aberdeen victims had answered
personal ads in the local papers.

58
00:06:14,834 --> 00:06:18,380
If this is the same killer,
he's just getting started.

<i>(knocking)</i>

60
00:07:31,369 --> 00:07:33,204
Yes, what is it?

61
00:07:34,205 --> 00:07:37,667
The handyman replaced the locks
on the storage closets and...

62
00:07:37,751 --> 00:07:40,253
...I wanted to bring by your new key.

63
00:07:46,468 --> 00:07:48,762
I know what you do, Mr lncanto.

64
00:07:50,138 --> 00:07:52,390
What is it you think that I do?

65
00:07:52,724 --> 00:07:56,561
Well, your typing, and those packages
from publishers in New York.

66
00:07:56,645 --> 00:07:59,981
You're a novelist, right? Or an editor?

67
00:08:00,732 --> 00:08:03,360
You see, I'm a writer too.

68
00:08:03,443 --> 00:08:05,904
What a coincidence.

69
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:08,907
Shouldn't you be off writing or something?

70
00:08:09,658 --> 00:08:13,328
I don't mean to impose. But would
you mind reading something of mine?

71
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:16,247
It won't take much time. They're poems.

72
00:08:17,248 --> 00:08:19,334
Certainly.

73
00:08:21,002 --> 00:08:22,587
Good bye.

74
00:08:33,932 --> 00:08:37,394
- Oh, it's you.
- That's not a problem, is it?

75
00:08:37,477 --> 00:08:42,482
No. It's just that Dr Kramer didn't tell me
that you were observing the autopsy.

76
00:08:42,607 --> 00:08:46,361
I'm not observing. I'm performing it myself.

77
00:08:46,444 --> 00:08:49,989
- You're a medical doctor?
- You sound surprised.

78
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:53,326
I don't know. I guess maybe I am.

79
00:08:54,494 --> 00:08:56,496
Why?

80
00:08:56,621 --> 00:09:01,501
It's nothing personal, Agent Scully.
I'm just... old-fashioned in certain regards.

81
00:09:02,460 --> 00:09:05,880
- Old-fashioned?
- The truth is...

82
00:09:05,964 --> 00:09:11,469
...I question the wisdom of assigning female
law-enforcement officers to certain cases.

83
00:09:11,553 --> 00:09:13,680
Like this one?

84
00:09:13,805 --> 00:09:17,851
Whoever killed Lauren Mackalvey
has a definite attitude toward women.

85
00:09:17,976 --> 00:09:20,103
So it has to affect your judgment.

86
00:09:20,186 --> 00:09:24,899
I appreciate your concern, Detective.
But it's not necessary.

87
00:09:24,983 --> 00:09:29,529
All I wanna do is solve this case.
Just like you.

88
00:09:29,654 --> 00:09:32,991
Look, I'm not being sexist here.
I'm just being honest.

89
00:09:34,159 --> 00:09:37,328
Where would you like
the autopsy report sent?

90
00:09:37,412 --> 00:09:39,497
You can fax it to my office.

91
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:55,597
The date is August 29th...

92
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,849
...the time is 4.15pm.

93
00:09:57,932 --> 00:10:00,560
The subject's name is Lauren Mackalvey.

94
00:10:00,685 --> 00:10:02,896
Caucasian, female.

95
00:10:03,021 --> 00:10:05,356
Approximate time of death uncertain...

96
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:08,526
...cause of death unknown.

97
00:10:35,637 --> 00:10:37,722
It just doesn't make sense.

98
00:10:38,890 --> 00:10:41,392
He seemed so... nice.

99
00:10:41,768 --> 00:10:44,479
I thought you never met the man
Lauren was with.

100
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:47,982
I never did.
He just seemed nice on the computer.

101
00:10:48,066 --> 00:10:52,237
- Oh, they met through an on-line service?
- In one of those chat rooms.

102
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,575
You know, where people get together
to talk about... whatever they're into.

103
00:10:57,659 --> 00:11:00,870
Do you remember what chat room
Lauren was in when she met him?

104
00:11:00,954 --> 00:11:05,458
"Big and beautiful."
She had... kind of a weight problem.

105
00:11:06,417 --> 00:11:10,421
But 2Shy didn't seem to care.
It wasn't about sex with him.

106
00:11:10,505 --> 00:11:13,091
- 2Shy?
- That was his on-line name.

107
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:17,303
Lauren used to...

108
00:11:17,428 --> 00:11:19,472
...read me his letters.

109
00:11:20,932 --> 00:11:24,936
They were amazing.
He knew exactly what to say.

110
00:11:29,107 --> 00:11:31,192
Sure as hell fooled me.

111
00:11:32,026 --> 00:11:36,573
She read you his letters. Do you think
that she kept any hard copies of 'em?

112
00:11:36,656 --> 00:11:39,242
Actually, ...

113
00:11:39,325 --> 00:11:41,452
...I saved them myself.

114
00:11:43,288 --> 00:11:46,165
- I can get them for you.
- Yes. Can I use your phone?

115
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,293
It's right over there.

116
00:11:52,005 --> 00:11:54,132
<i>(mobile phone rings)</i>

117
00:11:55,842 --> 00:11:57,385
<i>- Scully.
- Listen, Scully.</i>

118
00:11:57,468 --> 00:12:00,305
Our killer may have moved from
the personals to the Internet.

119
00:12:00,388 --> 00:12:04,475
- I'm gonna send a localised on-line warning.
- How do you know it's the same guy?

120
00:12:04,559 --> 00:12:07,687
<i>He opened the account with
an Aberdeen victim's credit card.</i>

121
00:12:07,812 --> 00:12:09,856
<i>I just called the on-line service.</i>

122
00:12:09,981 --> 00:12:13,026
Meet me in the coroner's office
as soon as you can.

123
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:14,736
Why? Did you find anything in the autopsy?

124
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:17,822
There's not going to be an autopsy.

125
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:22,535
It's a metacarpal
from Lauren Mackalvey's hand.

126
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,121
In life, bones have
the tensile strength of iron.

127
00:12:25,204 --> 00:12:28,541
Even in death they remain strong.
But look at this.

128
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,756
- What did this turn out to be?
- It's organic.

129
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:38,760
Mostly hydrochloric acid, similar
to what is secreted by the gastric mucosa.

130
00:12:38,843 --> 00:12:43,056
- It's similar to stomach acid?
- Almost identical, only twice as acidic.

131
00:12:43,181 --> 00:12:47,810
I also found trace amounts of pepsin,
which is a digestive enzyme.

132
00:12:47,894 --> 00:12:50,605
So you're saying that this did that?

133
00:12:51,356 --> 00:12:55,568
I don't know how else to explain
such accelerated autolysis.

134
00:12:55,693 --> 00:13:00,949
OK, what's in here should contain the same
cellular components as her various tissues.

135
00:13:01,032 --> 00:13:04,369
- Skin, muscle, blood.
- In some broken-down form, yes.

136
00:13:04,452 --> 00:13:07,497
In your chemical analysis results,
was anything missing?

137
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,374
- Missing?
- Yeah.

138
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:11,542
I don't think so.

139
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,882
All the body tissues were accounted for.

140
00:13:17,966 --> 00:13:21,803
Well, except there were extremely low,
almost trace amounts of adipose.

141
00:13:21,886 --> 00:13:24,013
Fatty tissue.

142
00:13:24,097 --> 00:13:27,684
- That'd explain the weight discrepancy.
- What weight discrepancy?

143
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:33,481
The ME recorded Lauren's weight at 122.
But her driver's licence had her at 165.

144
00:13:33,564 --> 00:13:36,693
She probably lost weight
since the licence was issued.

145
00:13:36,776 --> 00:13:39,362
Her roommate said
she was nervous about the meeting...

146
00:13:39,445 --> 00:13:42,407
...because she'd put on
some weight recently.

147
00:13:43,825 --> 00:13:48,871
What possible motivation could the killer
have for removing his victim's fatty tissue?

148
00:13:48,955 --> 00:13:52,875
- Who do you think we're dealing with here?
- I don't know.

149
00:13:54,794 --> 00:13:58,548
God, I look awful.
Please tell me it's the mirror.

150
00:13:58,631 --> 00:14:02,468
Ellen, this wasn't
some public-service announcement.

151
00:14:02,593 --> 00:14:07,598
It was an on-line warning by the FBI
aimed specifically at women in Cleveland.

152
00:14:07,682 --> 00:14:12,103
Give me some credit, will ya, Jo? I happen
to be a pretty good judge of character.

153
00:14:12,186 --> 00:14:15,565
- I'm not trying to freak you out or anything.
- No?

154
00:14:15,648 --> 00:14:21,279
- Well, you're doing a pretty good job of it.
- I just think you should be careful, that's all.

155
00:14:21,946 --> 00:14:24,282
Do you think this is easy for me?

156
00:14:24,365 --> 00:14:28,077
I finally connect with someone I like
who seems to like me.

157
00:14:28,161 --> 00:14:32,248
I'm scared enough to meet him without
you telling me he's Charles Manson.

158
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:34,625
I didn't say that.

159
00:14:34,709 --> 00:14:37,837
Besides, it's not like he's some stranger.

160
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:41,841
I've been chatting with him every day
for over a month.

161
00:14:41,966 --> 00:14:45,970
I know.
And he's probably as great as he sounds.

162
00:14:46,846 --> 00:14:48,681
But what if he isn't?

163
00:15:26,677 --> 00:15:29,764
Check it out!
Want a little chocolate tonight?

164
00:15:34,018 --> 00:15:36,104
Hey, baby. Right here!

165
00:15:40,608 --> 00:15:43,027
Come on, now.

166
00:16:00,962 --> 00:16:03,923
Down here!
We got what you need over here.

167
00:16:04,048 --> 00:16:07,426
- Would you like some of this?
- Ooh, yeah. Uh-huh!

168
00:16:07,552 --> 00:16:10,346
- See something you like?
- Do you want some?

169
00:16:10,429 --> 00:16:13,933
- I think he has the hots for you, baby.
- I think so.

170
00:16:24,735 --> 00:16:26,737
What do you like, baby?

171
00:16:26,821 --> 00:16:28,781
Uh-uh. No kissin'.

172
00:16:29,407 --> 00:16:32,743
Anything else you want is fine.
But no kissin'.

173
00:16:39,125 --> 00:16:41,294
What are you doin'?

174
00:16:47,967 --> 00:16:49,510
<i>(screams)</i>

175
00:16:51,429 --> 00:16:53,890
There's a place we can go near here.

176
00:16:53,973 --> 00:16:56,767
- Nice and cosy.
- OK.

177
00:16:58,102 --> 00:16:59,812
<i>(slurps)</i>

178
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:01,981
<i>(couple approach)</i>

179
00:17:16,996 --> 00:17:19,123
Uh-uh. Forget this!

180
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,461
Oh, my God!

181
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,969
Make sure you get statements
from all of them.

182
00:17:34,805 --> 00:17:38,476
Holly McClaine. She's worked this area
for a couple of years now...

183
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,480
...but she wasn't most johns' first pick,
if you know what I mean.

184
00:17:42,563 --> 00:17:45,608
- What happened?
- Well, it looks like our guy again.

185
00:17:45,691 --> 00:17:48,694
- One of the girls found her.
- The airways are blocked...

186
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:52,823
...with what appears to be the same
viscous acid we found on Lauren.

187
00:17:53,074 --> 00:17:55,159
You know what this stuff is?

188
00:17:58,371 --> 00:18:00,039
This is still my case.

189
00:18:00,164 --> 00:18:04,293
He's a serial murderer who's using
an on-line service to attract his victims.

190
00:18:04,377 --> 00:18:08,464
- All single women looking for Mr Right.
- That doesn't jibe with a $20 hooker.

191
00:18:08,547 --> 00:18:12,843
No. Something must have gone wrong
last night. He was forced to improvise.

192
00:18:13,344 --> 00:18:15,554
So it's a guy without a consistent MO.

193
00:18:15,763 --> 00:18:19,934
Not necessarily. These are letters
he e-mailed to Lauren Mackalvey.

194
00:18:20,017 --> 00:18:24,188
They contain lines from a handful
of sixteenth-century Italian poems.

195
00:18:24,272 --> 00:18:27,024
<i>So he has</i> a <i>copy of Bartlett's Quotations.
So</i> what?

196
00:18:27,108 --> 00:18:30,820
- <i>You won't find</i> these <i>in Bartlett's.</i>
- <i>I'm not sure</i> I <i>follow</i> you.

197
00:18:30,903 --> 00:18:37,285
<i>Look at this. La Vita Nuova, Castiglione's ll
Cortegiano,</i> a <i>few</i> I <i>won't try to pronounce.</i>

198
00:18:37,368 --> 00:18:39,954
These are from obscure texts
from private libraries

199
00:18:40,037 --> 00:18:42,415
that only lend to academic affiliates.

200
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:45,042
You're saying our suspect's a professor?

201
00:18:45,126 --> 00:18:47,712
Or a graduate student, maybe a translator.

202
00:18:47,795 --> 00:18:51,549
We need to compile a list of everybody
in Cleveland who has these credentials.

203
00:18:51,632 --> 00:18:54,051
- Can you do that?
- Yeah. I'll get right on it.

204
00:18:54,135 --> 00:18:56,887
Here's something else that might help.

205
00:18:58,389 --> 00:19:02,143
The killer should have
an identifiable wound pattern from this.

206
00:19:02,226 --> 00:19:05,438
Looks like she took her pound of flesh, huh?

207
00:19:18,659 --> 00:19:20,745
<i>(door bell)</i>

208
00:19:33,174 --> 00:19:34,383
Yes?

209
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:38,429
<i>I got a package for lncanto
from Stracher Publishing.</i>

210
00:19:39,430 --> 00:19:42,767
- Leave <i>it.</i>
- <i>Sorry. I gotta get</i> a <i>signature.</i>

211
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,502
Hello, Mr lncanto.

212
00:20:12,129 --> 00:20:15,925
- Good afternoon, Jesse.
- Jesse, did you find those drop cloths yet?

213
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:18,594
Oh, Mr lncanto,
I didn't know you were out here.

214
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:20,763
I'm just picking up a package.

215
00:20:20,846 --> 00:20:23,432
Jesse,
did you know that Mr lncanto's a writer?

216
00:20:23,516 --> 00:20:25,976
I know, Mom.
You told me a thousand times.

217
00:20:27,812 --> 00:20:29,355
I'm putting those poems together.

218
00:20:29,438 --> 00:20:32,233
If you don't mind,
I'd like to drop them by sometime.

219
00:20:32,316 --> 00:20:34,777
Just slip it under my door.

220
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:38,531
After you've read them,
can I take you to dinner somewhere?

221
00:20:38,656 --> 00:20:41,909
- Gimme a break.
- Actually, I'm busy. I have a deadline.

222
00:20:41,992 --> 00:20:46,330
- Oh, I don't believe this.
- (knocking) Excuse me!

223
00:20:48,082 --> 00:20:53,337
- I wish you weren't always so rude to him.
- I don't care. He creeps me out.

224
00:20:53,421 --> 00:20:57,341
Plus he smells gross.
Like he uses dish soap for aftershave.

225
00:20:57,508 --> 00:20:58,926
Ohh!

226
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:02,346
<i>(lncanto) OK. There you go. Thanks.</i>

227
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:05,224
<i>(front door shuts)</i>

228
00:21:14,859 --> 00:21:19,363
OK. Blaine just gave me
the list from the university.

229
00:21:19,447 --> 00:21:22,324
- How's it going?
- Good. We've expanded the search...

230
00:21:22,408 --> 00:21:26,495
...to include the faculty rosters
from the local community colleges. We...

231
00:21:26,579 --> 00:21:28,038
Oh.

232
00:21:28,122 --> 00:21:30,374
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

233
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:32,751
I'll let you know what we turn up.

234
00:21:33,711 --> 00:21:36,297
- Find anything?
- We're almost done with the list.

235
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:38,382
That skin under the fingernails?

236
00:21:38,466 --> 00:21:42,136
The lab checked the DNA results
against the "known offenders" database.

237
00:21:42,219 --> 00:21:43,888
And?

238
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:50,436
- They didn't find a match.
- They did find something else.

239
00:21:50,561 --> 00:21:53,397
Check the next page where it's circled.

240
00:21:53,481 --> 00:21:56,859
"The skin sample contains
no oils or essential fatty acid."

241
00:21:56,942 --> 00:22:00,905
Any number of factors could cause
that result. Where are you going with this?

242
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:05,784
OK, it's not yet the finely detailed insanity
you expect from me. It's just a theory.

243
00:22:05,910 --> 00:22:10,623
But what if this isn't a psychotic impulse,
but rather some physical hunger?

244
00:22:10,748 --> 00:22:14,460
Maybe he needs to replenish
this chemical deficiency to survive.

245
00:22:14,585 --> 00:22:18,506
From a dry skin sample, you're concluding
that he's a fat-sucking vampire?

246
00:22:18,589 --> 00:22:21,383
How else can you explain
Mackalvey's missing adipose?

247
00:22:21,467 --> 00:22:24,386
I bet the Aberdeen victims
would show the same thing.

248
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:28,098
This killer secretes a substance
which renders the victim's fat...

249
00:22:28,182 --> 00:22:32,186
Which he ingests before
the rest of the body dissolves entirely.

250
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:34,813
There are examples in nature, aren't there?

251
00:22:34,939 --> 00:22:38,025
Yeah, scorpions pre-digest
their food outside of their body

252
00:22:38,108 --> 00:22:39,985
by regurgitating onto their prey.

253
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:43,489
But I don't know too many scorpions
who surf the Internet.

254
00:22:43,614 --> 00:22:46,784
If I'm right, we're not just looking
for a serial murderer...

255
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:50,829
...but a genetically different human being
who may be responsible for...

256
00:22:50,955 --> 00:22:54,583
...who knows how many missing persons
cases throughout the country.

257
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:58,504
I've combed every faculty list in Cleveland.
Came up with 38 names.

258
00:22:58,629 --> 00:23:01,799
If we divvy up the list,
and put some more people on it...

259
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:05,844
- All right.
- I'd like to brief them, if that's OK with you.

260
00:23:08,472 --> 00:23:10,140
Sure.

261
00:23:29,535 --> 00:23:31,662
<i>(computer) You have mail.</i>

262
00:23:56,729 --> 00:23:58,606
<i>(knocking)</i>

263
00:24:01,567 --> 00:24:05,738
Mr Brenman?
I'm Special Agent Scully from the FBI.

264
00:24:06,614 --> 00:24:09,533
Would you mind
if I ask you some questions?

265
00:24:14,038 --> 00:24:16,540
Thanks. I'm sorry to bother you.

266
00:24:19,543 --> 00:24:21,795
I'd like to ask you a few questions.

267
00:24:23,047 --> 00:24:24,131
Sure.

268
00:24:34,224 --> 00:24:35,851
These are all university addresses.

269
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:39,480
Chances are he spent
most of the morning on campus.

270
00:24:40,648 --> 00:24:42,733
Scully?

271
00:24:42,816 --> 00:24:45,819
I'm not much of a salesman.
I knocked on more doors than...

272
00:24:45,903 --> 00:24:50,741
Cross hasn't checked in yet. We've tried
his cellphone, but there's no answer.

273
00:24:55,454 --> 00:24:58,415
- I'm treating you.
- No, I insist.

274
00:24:58,499 --> 00:25:01,669
After the way I stood you up,
I'm the one who should insist.

275
00:25:01,752 --> 00:25:03,837
Please.

276
00:25:14,598 --> 00:25:19,603
- I'm sorry. I shouldn't have...
- It's eczema. I've had it since I was a kid.

277
00:25:23,607 --> 00:25:26,902
You know,
I still feel so stupid about the other night.

278
00:25:26,985 --> 00:25:30,030
Ellen, you don't have to make any excuses.

279
00:25:30,114 --> 00:25:33,701
Whatever reasons you had,
I'm sure they were good ones.

280
00:25:33,784 --> 00:25:37,162
You were right, though.
About me being afraid?

281
00:25:38,122 --> 00:25:41,792
- It's a pretty hard habit to break.
- You're not still afraid, are you?

282
00:25:43,836 --> 00:25:47,047
- No, I'm not.
- Good.

283
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:51,760
Unfortunately, I have to get going.

284
00:25:51,844 --> 00:25:54,805
The last crosstown bus
leaves in 15 minutes.

285
00:25:54,888 --> 00:25:58,475
- You're taking the bus home?
- My car's in the shop. I'll call you.

286
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:02,354
- Don't be silly. I'll drive you.
- Ellen, you don't have to do that.

287
00:26:02,813 --> 00:26:04,857
I'm driving you home.

288
00:26:20,497 --> 00:26:22,583
Mr lncanto?

289
00:26:49,902 --> 00:26:52,404
So how long have you lived here?

290
00:26:53,447 --> 00:26:54,823
Not very long.

291
00:26:54,907 --> 00:26:57,785
I only live a few blocks away,
near St Mark's.

292
00:26:57,868 --> 00:27:00,788
Until some developer
decided to turn it into condos.

293
00:27:00,871 --> 00:27:03,081
You can still see the steeple.

294
00:27:03,207 --> 00:27:07,211
Ellen, you don't have to be nervous.

295
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:10,297
I'm not very good at this.

296
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:14,551
It's been a long time
since I've been in this type of situation.

297
00:27:16,220 --> 00:27:17,930
It's OK.

Mr lncanto?

311
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:29,645
- What is it, Jesse?
- Do you know where my mom is?

312
00:29:29,728 --> 00:29:31,813
Your mother? No.

313
00:29:31,897 --> 00:29:35,859
She takes a class down
at St Frank's tonight. A poetry class.

314
00:29:35,943 --> 00:29:39,446
And... she was supposed
to be home over an hour ago.

315
00:29:40,197 --> 00:29:42,532
I'm sure she'll be home soon.

316
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,124
She didn't stop by to say hi or anything?

317
00:29:51,583 --> 00:29:53,710
No. Not tonight.

318
00:29:54,252 --> 00:29:56,380
OK.

319
00:29:57,297 --> 00:30:00,217
Thanks. She'll probably be home soon.

320
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,272
I'm going to New York
for a few days on business.

321
00:30:18,902 --> 00:30:21,154
Don't worry about your mother.

322
00:30:22,072 --> 00:30:24,157
I'm sure she'll be fine.

323
00:30:33,917 --> 00:30:37,129
Yes, ma'am, a police detective.
His name's Cross.

324
00:30:39,006 --> 00:30:43,260
That's right, he would have been by
sometime this afternoon.

325
00:30:43,343 --> 00:30:47,597
Sometime this morning.
Do you remember what time specifically?

326
00:30:48,098 --> 00:30:52,394
Could you describe him to me
for verification? Excuse me a minute.

327
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:54,771
- Did you find him?
- Wejustgota 911.

328
00:30:54,938 --> 00:30:59,192
A possible homicide from a young girl
at one of the addresses on Cross's list.

329
00:31:01,528 --> 00:31:03,613
Police!

330
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:15,292
<i>(officer) We got two in here!</i>

331
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,295
Mulder?

332
00:31:18,837 --> 00:31:21,798
The landlady's body.
We found her in the bathroom.

333
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:24,217
What about Cross?

334
00:31:25,886 --> 00:31:28,305
I know this is hard to talk about right now.

335
00:31:28,388 --> 00:31:31,725
But I need you to tell me
exactly what happened.

336
00:31:33,477 --> 00:31:35,645
I smelled her perfume.

337
00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:37,814
Your mother's perfume?

338
00:31:39,983 --> 00:31:42,235
That's when I knew he was lying.

339
00:31:42,903 --> 00:31:46,281
She was wearing her perfume
when she left for her class.

340
00:31:46,364 --> 00:31:48,533
And you smelled it in his apartment?

341
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:53,330
I... I was scared that he'd hurt me.

342
00:31:54,706 --> 00:31:57,125
I could tell he wanted to.

343
00:31:57,209 --> 00:32:00,879
- And when he grabbed me...
- He grabbed you?

344
00:32:01,505 --> 00:32:06,009
After I bumped into the suitcase.
He grabbed me pretty hard.

345
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:11,014
- What suitcase?
- It was next to the door.

346
00:32:12,265 --> 00:32:16,228
He said he was going away
on business or something.

347
00:32:17,354 --> 00:32:19,397
Did he say where?

348
00:32:22,359 --> 00:32:24,027
New York.

349
00:32:27,114 --> 00:32:29,199
OK, Jesse. That helps us.

350
00:32:30,909 --> 00:32:34,412
I'm gonna take a couple of minutes
and go talk to Agent Mulder.

351
00:32:34,538 --> 00:32:36,581
Mrs Shepherd is right here.

352
00:32:37,707 --> 00:32:39,793
I'll be right back.

353
00:32:40,544 --> 00:32:42,629
Agent Scully?

354
00:32:43,547 --> 00:32:45,715
Why would someone do this?

355
00:32:47,384 --> 00:32:49,427
I don't know, Jesse.

356
00:32:57,561 --> 00:33:02,566
The composite artist made this sketch from
a description. His name is Virgil lncanto.

357
00:33:02,649 --> 00:33:06,862
According to his rental agreement. But
there's no other record that the guy exists.

358
00:33:06,945 --> 00:33:11,366
There's no DMV, no birth certificate,
no Social Security, not even a bank account.

359
00:33:11,449 --> 00:33:15,203
- Employment records?
- He's a translator of Italian. Freelance.

360
00:33:15,287 --> 00:33:17,622
His publisher pays him in cashier's cheques.

361
00:33:17,747 --> 00:33:20,750
He told the girl
he was on his way to New York.

362
00:33:20,834 --> 00:33:25,005
I'll check flight schedules
and have the airport issue an APB.

363
00:33:26,256 --> 00:33:29,926
- What is it?
- He's not goin' to New York, Scully.

364
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:32,095
Not now.

365
00:33:32,971 --> 00:33:36,808
He's smarter than that.
He knows how to survive, you know?

366
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:38,977
Well, how are we gonna track him?

367
00:33:39,102 --> 00:33:41,730
He made contact with
each of his victims, right?

368
00:33:41,813 --> 00:33:44,691
- Yeah.
- That means they're all in here somewhere.

369
00:33:44,774 --> 00:33:48,195
Each one of 'em. Past, present and future.

370
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:59,122
- All files have been deleted.
- Any chance of resurrecting them?

371
00:33:59,206 --> 00:34:03,335
It's hard to say.
He deliberately reformatted his hard drive.

372
00:34:03,460 --> 00:34:06,713
This guy didn't want anyone
looking at his stuff.

373
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,347
Hmm.

374
00:34:15,472 --> 00:34:19,476
The good news is...
I can restore the erased files.

375
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:21,394
And the bad news?

376
00:34:21,478 --> 00:34:24,731
These files are all password protected
and encrypted.

377
00:34:24,814 --> 00:34:27,859
- It could take some time.
- We don't have much time.

378
00:34:27,984 --> 00:34:30,237
It'll take as long as it takes.

Is that you?

Joanne?

383
00:34:43,833 --> 00:34:47,003
- Who is it?
- (lncanto) Ellen, it's me.

384
00:34:48,213 --> 00:34:50,298
- It's late.
- I know.

385
00:34:50,382 --> 00:34:53,510
And I'd like not to wake your neighbours.

386
00:34:58,431 --> 00:35:02,727
- Can we talk about what happened tonight?
- There's nothing to talk about.

387
00:35:02,852 --> 00:35:05,772
- You made it clear what you wanted.
- You don't understand.

388
00:35:05,855 --> 00:35:07,941
- I think I do.
- Look, Ellen.

389
00:35:08,024 --> 00:35:12,028
I gave you a second chance
after you made me wait in that restaurant.

390
00:35:12,112 --> 00:35:17,617
Give me the same courtesy, please.
And then if you want me to go, I'll go.

391
00:35:18,702 --> 00:35:21,788
Only... let's not do it out here.

392
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:39,222
Thank you.

393
00:35:40,724 --> 00:35:43,226
You want some coffee? I can make some.

394
00:35:44,102 --> 00:35:46,563
Yeah. I'd like that.

395
00:36:06,624 --> 00:36:08,877
They're coming up empty at the airport.

396
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:13,673
So I'm releasing the sketch to the media.
We can still make the morning papers.

397
00:36:13,757 --> 00:36:15,592
That may not be necessary.

398
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:19,387
- "Friend"?
- Lauren's on-line name.

399
00:36:19,471 --> 00:36:23,600
These are all his victims.
A regular grocery list.

400
00:36:23,683 --> 00:36:27,062
We need this scanned
and sent to everyone on that list.

401
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:30,231
- Done.
- I'm gonna call the on-line service...

402
00:36:30,315 --> 00:36:34,611
...and have them fax us
the telephone numbers of all those women.

- Milk? I only have non-fat.
- No, no, no. This is fine.

406
00:36:49,959 --> 00:36:52,879
Give me a minute, will you?
I'll put on some clothes.

407
00:36:53,171 --> 00:36:56,716
- Ellen, you don't have to do that.
- I want to.

408
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,885
I'll be right back.

409
00:37:30,166 --> 00:37:32,877
Just lock your doors
until we contact you again.

410
00:37:33,002 --> 00:37:36,673
You'll be fine, Ms lnnes.
He doesn't tend toward forcible entry.

411
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:38,758
OK, thanks.

412
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:44,556
Cleveland PD have already reported
three of the women on the list as missing.

413
00:37:44,681 --> 00:37:48,685
We've already contacted everyone
on this list directly, except for these two.

414
00:37:48,768 --> 00:37:52,939
- I left messages on their machines.
- You'd better go check on 'em anyway.

415
00:38:06,077 --> 00:38:08,079
<i>You have mail.</i>

416
00:38:17,464 --> 00:38:19,549
Ellen?

417
00:38:21,092 --> 00:38:24,095
I hope you're not on line
with some other guy.

418
00:38:27,098 --> 00:38:29,893
I was just e-mailing my girlfriend.

419
00:38:29,976 --> 00:38:32,729
- Your girlfriend?
- Yes.

420
00:38:33,813 --> 00:38:35,899
What about?

421
00:38:36,941 --> 00:38:40,320
- Us.
- What were you telling her?

422
00:38:41,779 --> 00:38:43,907
Just how happy I am.

423
00:38:45,241 --> 00:38:47,785
That you're still interested in me.

424
00:38:47,911 --> 00:38:51,414
And that you hadn't rejected me
like I thought you had.

425
00:38:59,756 --> 00:39:02,133
I'm glad you feel that way, Ellen.

426
00:39:02,592 --> 00:39:05,345
- I know I do.
- Look.

427
00:39:05,428 --> 00:39:09,432
I still haven't changed my clothes.
Go wait outside and I'll be right out.

428
00:39:09,516 --> 00:39:12,560
You look beautiful.
You don't need to change for me.

Can I help you?

432
00:39:41,047 --> 00:39:43,800
We're with the FBI.
We're looking for Ellen Kaminsky.

433
00:39:43,883 --> 00:39:47,387
She's in her condo. She just e-mailed me.
Why? What's wrong?

- Get back in.
