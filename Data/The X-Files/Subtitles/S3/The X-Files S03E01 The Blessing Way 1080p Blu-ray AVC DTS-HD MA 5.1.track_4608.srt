1
00:00:05,674 --> 00:00:08,260
<i>There is an ancient Indian saying...</i>

2
00:00:08,343 --> 00:00:13,432
<i>...that something lives only as long
as the last person who remembers it.</i>

3
00:00:13,682 --> 00:00:17,936
<i>My people have come to trust
memory over history.</i>

4
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:22,399
<i>Memory, like fire,
is radiant and immutable...</i>

5
00:00:23,275 --> 00:00:27,279
<i>...while history serves only those
who seek to control it...</i>

6
00:00:27,362 --> 00:00:30,282
<i>...those who would douse
the flame of memory...</i>

7
00:00:30,365 --> 00:00:33,952
<i>...in order to put out
the dangerous fire of truth.</i>

8
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:38,790
<i>Beware these men,
for they are dangerous themselves,</i> ...

9
00:00:38,874 --> 00:00:41,043
<i>...and unwise.</i>

10
00:00:41,126 --> 00:00:46,548
<i>Their false history is written in the blood
of those who might remember...</i>

11
00:00:46,632 --> 00:00:48,634
<i>...and of those who seek the truth.</i>

12
00:00:49,092 --> 00:00:50,219
Let's go)!

13
00:00:50,302 --> 00:00:51,803
Get down! Get down!

14
00:00:51,887 --> 00:00:53,639
Don't move!

15
00:00:54,264 --> 00:00:57,059
On your knees! Hands behind your head!

16
00:00:58,101 --> 00:01:01,230
- I wanna know where Mulder is!
- I don't know.

17
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,067
His car is parked outside! He was here!

18
00:01:06,276 --> 00:01:08,987
I want Mulder and I want those files!

19
00:01:09,112 --> 00:01:11,657
You will find nothing here.

20
00:01:31,176 --> 00:01:33,178
What happened?

21
00:01:33,303 --> 00:01:35,347
There were men.

22
00:01:36,265 --> 00:01:39,351
They were looking for your partner.

23
00:01:40,519 --> 00:01:42,479
Where is he?

24
00:02:06,044 --> 00:02:07,546
Mulder!

25
00:03:34,466 --> 00:03:36,385
Out of the car!

26
00:03:36,468 --> 00:03:37,886
Come on!

27
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:40,972
Hands on top! Spread your legs!

28
00:03:42,974 --> 00:03:46,561
- Where's Agent Mulder?
- Turn and face away!

29
00:03:46,645 --> 00:03:48,814
Where are the files?

30
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:50,816
In the trunk.

31
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:05,997
- We need the DAT copy.
- I don't have it.

32
00:04:06,081 --> 00:04:07,666
Who has it?

33
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:09,501
Agent Mulder.

34
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,839
Let's go)!

35
00:04:25,475 --> 00:04:29,312
<i>It is the recommendation of the
Office of Professional Conduct...</i>

36
00:04:29,688 --> 00:04:34,276
...that Special Agent Dana Scully
be given a mandatory leave of absence...

37
00:04:34,359 --> 00:04:38,530
...until the full detail of her misconduct
can be calculated.

38
00:04:39,156 --> 00:04:43,785
This summary action is justified
under the OPC articles of review...

39
00:04:43,869 --> 00:04:47,456
...and Agent Scully will complete
her suspension of duty

40
00:04:47,539 --> 00:04:49,374
without pay or benefits...

41
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:52,711
...due to the nature of her insubordination...

42
00:04:52,836 --> 00:04:57,048
...and the direct disobedience
of her superior agents.

43
00:04:57,132 --> 00:05:01,720
We will have to ask that you check
your weapon and your badge...

44
00:05:01,845 --> 00:05:05,390
...before you leave the building,
Agent Scully.

45
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:18,236
Make yourself available to answer further
questions on Agent Mulder's whereabouts.

46
00:05:20,864 --> 00:05:26,495
I've told you everything I know. To the best
of my knowledge, Agent Mulder is dead.

47
00:05:28,413 --> 00:05:32,584
Don't think this hasn't
been difficult for everyone.

48
00:05:46,848 --> 00:05:48,934
Agent Scully!

49
00:05:49,893 --> 00:05:52,103
Who are these people?

50
00:05:54,272 --> 00:05:55,857
They're doing their job.

51
00:05:55,941 --> 00:05:59,444
They're putting an official stamp
on the perpetuation of a lie!

52
00:05:59,528 --> 00:06:02,614
They're following protocol,
which you and Agent Mulder did not!

53
00:06:02,697 --> 00:06:06,117
And the people poisoning Mulder's water?
Whose protocol was that?

54
00:06:06,243 --> 00:06:09,037
- The investigation...
- Will be an exercise!

55
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,457
The men who killed Agent Mulder
and his father aren't meant to be found.

56
00:06:12,582 --> 00:06:14,626
We will find them.

57
00:06:14,709 --> 00:06:17,128
With all due respect,
I think you overestimate your position

58
00:06:17,212 --> 00:06:19,214
in the chain of command.

59
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,916
Where were the safeguards against this?

60
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,419
These files were never to be seen.

61
00:06:57,502 --> 00:07:01,673
Forty years of work.
The damage could be incalculable.

62
00:07:01,756 --> 00:07:06,511
- The damage is done.
- Gentlemen, we have control.

63
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:11,600
The files have been recovered and the men
involved in the theft have been removed.

64
00:07:11,683 --> 00:07:17,606
There is a matter of concern with the FBI.
We'll handle that internally, as usual.

65
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:22,193
The media attention will amount
to a few scattered obituaries.

66
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:24,654
The Mulder problem.

67
00:07:27,699 --> 00:07:30,952
Special Agent Mulder is dead.

68
00:07:31,036 --> 00:07:33,371
His body will not be recovered.

69
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:37,709
He'll be listed as missing until
the matter can be resolved quietly.

70
00:07:37,834 --> 00:07:41,921
And we've recovered the copy
of the stolen computer files?

71
00:07:42,005 --> 00:07:43,381
Yes.

72
00:07:43,923 --> 00:07:45,800
Then the pertinent parties
should be informed

73
00:07:45,884 --> 00:07:48,511
and we can continue with our work.

74
00:07:51,014 --> 00:07:53,308
- Dana!
- Hi, Mom.

75
00:07:53,391 --> 00:07:55,977
What are you doing with your shoes?

76
00:07:56,061 --> 00:07:59,397
They started to give me blisters, so...

77
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:02,734
You walked here at this time of night?

78
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:05,528
Oh, Mom...

79
00:08:06,905 --> 00:08:11,076
- What is it, Dana?
- I've made a terrible mistake.

80
00:08:13,912 --> 00:08:16,748
Dad would be so ashamed of me.

81
00:08:21,378 --> 00:08:26,091
<i>The men who had come and threatened us
did not return to our house again.</i>

82
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:30,679
<i>But the following day
some of the boys from the reservation...</i>

83
00:08:30,762 --> 00:08:35,600
<i>...came to tell us they had seen buzzards
flying out near the quarry...</i>

84
00:08:35,684 --> 00:08:38,520
<i>...where Eric had first encountered the men.</i>

85
00:08:41,773 --> 00:08:45,110
<i>The buzzard is a large but cowardly bird.</i>

86
00:08:45,235 --> 00:08:49,948
<i>It does not work for its prey,
letting others provide the kill.</i>

87
00:08:50,615 --> 00:08:53,535
<i>When I see them circling in the desert...</i>

88
00:08:53,618 --> 00:08:56,413
<i>...this can only mean
that something has died</i>

89
00:08:56,496 --> 00:08:59,457
<i>and they are going to pick its bones.</i>

90
00:08:59,582 --> 00:09:01,793
<i>Or that death is close...</i>

91
00:09:01,918 --> 00:09:05,630
<i>...and they are waiting for it
to do its work for them.</i>

92
00:09:05,714 --> 00:09:08,133
<i>We did not see what they saw...</i>

93
00:09:08,258 --> 00:09:12,804
<i>...but I remembered something
I had seen as a younger man.</i>

94
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:15,640
<i>Just as my grandson had done...</i>

95
00:09:15,765 --> 00:09:18,893
<i>...I too had found a body at the quarry...</i>

96
00:09:18,977 --> 00:09:22,564
<i>...in a hole, half buried under rocks.</i>

97
00:09:22,647 --> 00:09:25,734
<i>But even the buzzards,
who will eat anything...</i>

98
00:09:25,817 --> 00:09:27,569
<i>...would not touch it.</i>

99
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:31,906
<i>This spot is where we found
what the buzzards had come for.</i>

100
00:09:32,407 --> 00:09:35,910
<i>We could not tell at first who
or what it was,"...</i>

101
00:09:35,994 --> 00:09:38,913
<i>...but I knew what the buzzards knew:</i>

102
00:09:38,997 --> 00:09:41,833
<i>that the smell of death was upon it.</i>

103
00:09:52,802 --> 00:09:56,181
<i>The desert does not forgive man
his weakness.</i>

104
00:09:56,264 --> 00:10:01,811
<i>Weak or strong, it takes no mercy,
and can kill a man in less than a day.</i>

105
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,606
<i>(speaks Navajo)</i>

106
00:10:05,774 --> 00:10:10,028
<i>To survive, one must develop
skin like leather...</i>

107
00:10:10,111 --> 00:10:14,866
<i>...know where to find water
and when to take shelter.</i>

108
00:10:28,213 --> 00:10:33,384
<i>The FBI man would have surely died
had he not stayed underground...</i>

109
00:10:33,468 --> 00:10:36,971
<i>...protected like the jack rabbit or the fox.</i>

110
00:10:37,472 --> 00:10:40,350
<i>Even so, death was near.</i>

111
00:10:41,392 --> 00:10:44,646
<i>In accordance with our ancient traditions...</i>

112
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:48,650
<i>...we put four oak twigs
on the beams of the hogan...</i>

113
00:10:48,733 --> 00:10:53,822
<i>...to summon the Holy People
and tell them that a ceremony will be held.</i>

114
00:10:54,697 --> 00:10:57,408
<i>It is called the Blessing Way chant.</i>

115
00:10:58,409 --> 00:11:02,497
<i>Only the Holy People
can save the FBI man's life now.</i>

116
00:11:03,081 --> 00:11:05,500
<i>He is in their hands.</i>

117
00:11:38,283 --> 00:11:40,410
<i>(doorbell)</i>

118
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:54,215
Frohike.

119
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:57,302
I know it's late, but I heard the news.

120
00:12:01,472 --> 00:12:05,059
Maybe I should go.
Pardon my presumptuousness.

121
00:12:05,143 --> 00:12:07,812
How much have you had to drink?

122
00:12:09,939 --> 00:12:11,983
Do you recycle?

123
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:17,614
He was a good friend.
A redwood among mere sprouts.

124
00:12:22,952 --> 00:12:26,497
I guess this means
he's passing you the torch.

125
00:12:26,581 --> 00:12:30,960
I'm afraid not. I'm soon to be out of a job.

126
00:12:31,628 --> 00:12:34,005
Those sons of bitches!

127
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:36,925
They're rigging the game.

128
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:41,512
And, like rats,
they just scatter back into the woodpile.

129
00:12:46,684 --> 00:12:49,354
- The rats that killed the cat.
- What's this?

130
00:12:49,437 --> 00:12:53,358
It's a news item about Kenneth Soona,
aka The Thinker.

131
00:12:53,441 --> 00:12:57,278
The man who hacked the MJ files.
The ones he gave to Mulder.

132
00:12:57,362 --> 00:13:00,531
"Kenneth J Soona
was killed execution-style...

133
00:13:00,657 --> 00:13:03,618
...in what appears to be
a professional murder...

134
00:13:03,701 --> 00:13:06,871
...his body found in the Trenton city landfill."

135
00:13:06,955 --> 00:13:09,290
What's the date on this?

136
00:13:09,374 --> 00:13:14,295
This was the day before yesterday.
This is after Mulder disappeared.

137
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:16,965
Could they be so stupid?

138
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:22,637
<i>This healing ritual called the Blessing Way...</i>

139
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,225
<i>...has been passed down
by our ancient Navajo ancestors.</i>

140
00:13:27,308 --> 00:13:33,398
<i>Its songs and prayers must be followed
just as they have been for centuries.</i>

141
00:13:33,523 --> 00:13:36,651
<i>Or the Holy People will not be summoned.</i>

142
00:13:38,569 --> 00:13:42,240
<i>I watched my father perform
the chants as a young boy...</i>

143
00:13:42,365 --> 00:13:44,909
<i>...and saw their healing magic.</i>

144
00:13:48,913 --> 00:13:54,919
<i>But my fear for the FBI man was that
his spirit did not want to be healed.</i>

145
00:13:55,044 --> 00:13:59,173
<i>That it wished to join the spirit
of his own father who had died...</i>

146
00:13:59,257 --> 00:14:03,428
<i>...and did not want to return
to the world of the living.</i>

147
00:14:06,264 --> 00:14:11,436
<i>His body has become tired and weak,
and it searches for rest.</i>

148
00:14:14,022 --> 00:14:16,107
<i>(chanting)</i>

149
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,788
<i>If the struggle to continue is too hard...</i>

150
00:14:30,872 --> 00:14:34,375
<i>...or the wish to join his ancestors
too strong...</i>

151
00:14:34,459 --> 00:14:37,211
<i>...the body will give up.</i>

152
00:14:37,295 --> 00:14:41,799
<i>But if the desire to resume life
burns brightly enough,</i> ...

153
00:14:41,883 --> 00:14:44,969
<i>...the Holy People will be merciful.</i>

154
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:50,892
<i>The days and nights now will be long
and difficult for the FBI man...</i>

155
00:14:50,975 --> 00:14:55,146
...as <i>the Holy People come
and help him to choose.</i>

156
00:14:56,731 --> 00:15:01,152
I was first struck by the absence of time...

157
00:15:01,235 --> 00:15:06,783
...having depended on it so completely
as a measure of myself and my life.

158
00:15:08,076 --> 00:15:13,915
Moving backwards into the perpetual night,
it consumes purpose and deed...

159
00:15:13,998 --> 00:15:16,667
...all passion and will.

160
00:15:19,670 --> 00:15:23,424
I come to you, old friend,
with the dull clarity of the dead...

161
00:15:23,508 --> 00:15:26,177
...not to beckon you...

162
00:15:26,260 --> 00:15:30,348
...but to feel the fire and intensity...

163
00:15:30,473 --> 00:15:33,101
...that still live in you.

164
00:15:33,184 --> 00:15:37,021
And the heavy weight of your burdens,
which I had once borne.

165
00:15:37,105 --> 00:15:41,692
There is truth, you know, friend,
if that's all you seek.

166
00:15:41,818 --> 00:15:47,198
But there's no justice orjudgment,
without which truth is a vast...

167
00:15:48,032 --> 00:15:49,534
...dead...

168
00:15:50,368 --> 00:15:51,869
...hollow.

169
00:15:52,787 --> 00:15:57,792
Go back. Do not look into the abyss
or let the abyss look into you.

170
00:15:57,875 --> 00:16:03,548
Awaken the sleep of reason,
and fight the monsters within and without.

171
00:16:07,468 --> 00:16:09,554
<i>(panicked screeching)</i>

172
00:16:14,183 --> 00:16:16,227
<i>(screeching continues)</i>

173
00:16:35,329 --> 00:16:37,081
Hello, son.

174
00:16:37,165 --> 00:16:40,042
I did not dare hope to see you so soon.

175
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:45,214
Or ever again hope to broker fate...

176
00:16:46,174 --> 00:16:48,885
...with a life to which I gave life.

177
00:16:51,262 --> 00:16:54,182
The lies I told you...

178
00:16:54,265 --> 00:16:56,767
...were a pox and poison to my soul.

179
00:16:56,893 --> 00:17:00,688
And now you are here because of them.

180
00:17:00,771 --> 00:17:06,527
Lies I thought might bury for ever
a truth I could not live with.

181
00:17:06,777 --> 00:17:12,033
I stand here, ashamed of the choices
I made so long ago...

182
00:17:12,116 --> 00:17:14,744
...when you were just a boy.

183
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:18,873
You are the memory, Fox.

184
00:17:18,956 --> 00:17:21,292
<i>It lives in you.</i>

185
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:25,213
If you were to die now...

186
00:17:25,296 --> 00:17:28,132
...the truth will die.

187
00:17:28,216 --> 00:17:30,927
And only the lies survive us.

188
00:17:32,303 --> 00:17:34,430
My sister...

189
00:17:35,473 --> 00:17:37,141
Is she here?

190
00:17:37,225 --> 00:17:39,143
No.

191
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:42,146
The thing that would destroy me...

192
00:17:42,271 --> 00:17:45,399
...the truth I felt you must never learn...

193
00:17:45,483 --> 00:17:48,653
...is the truth you will find...

194
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,822
...if you are to go forward.

195
00:18:15,346 --> 00:18:19,267
(tour <i>guide)</i> OK, step through
the metal detector and we'll begin the tour.

196
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:22,103
This facility is the J Edgar Hoover Building.

197
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:27,024
It was finished in 1974 and built on
the site of the original FBI headquarters.

198
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:32,113
There's a display on the "Ten Most Wanted".
You might see a few of your relatives there!

199
00:18:32,196 --> 00:18:36,367
If you have any questions,
I'll do my best to answer them.

200
00:18:36,492 --> 00:18:40,037
Makin' you come in the front door
these days, Agent Scully?

201
00:18:40,121 --> 00:18:41,706
For now.

202
00:18:41,831 --> 00:18:43,291
<i>(Dew)</i>

203
00:18:44,292 --> 00:18:46,877
- Are you carrying your weapon?
- No.

204
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:52,008
- Sorry to have to run you through this.
- That's OK.

205
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:55,303
That was weird.

206
00:18:55,386 --> 00:19:01,225
I've had a stray pin left in a shirt collar set
this machine off. But you can go on through.

207
00:19:01,350 --> 00:19:03,019
Thank you.

208
00:19:06,188 --> 00:19:08,232
Scully, come in, please.

209
00:19:16,073 --> 00:19:19,493
You said you needed to see me
concerning the investigation?

210
00:19:19,577 --> 00:19:21,329
Yes, sir.

211
00:19:21,412 --> 00:19:26,334
I came across a news article. A man's body
was found and I have reason to believe...

212
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:29,587
...he was killed by the same man
responsible for Agent Mulder.

213
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:31,589
Can I see it?

214
00:19:33,341 --> 00:19:36,677
The date of death postdates
Agent Mulder's disappearance.

215
00:19:36,761 --> 00:19:41,349
Now you already have the ballistics data
from Agent Mulder's father on file.

216
00:19:41,432 --> 00:19:44,685
I'd like you to run it against
the ballistics from this man's case.

217
00:19:44,769 --> 00:19:46,354
To try and prove what?

218
00:19:46,437 --> 00:19:50,274
Well, if both men were killed by the same
weapon, Mulder didn't kill his father.

219
00:19:50,358 --> 00:19:53,361
And it could help us find the men who did.

220
00:19:53,444 --> 00:19:56,280
You've been relieved of
your investigative function.

221
00:19:56,364 --> 00:20:00,785
Yes, I know that, sir.
I just thought this might be helpful.

222
00:20:01,952 --> 00:20:04,288
I'm afraid not.

223
00:20:04,372 --> 00:20:09,627
This case would have been handled by
the Trenton PD. They're on our database.

224
00:20:09,752 --> 00:20:12,880
If there was a match on the two slugs,
we'd know by now.

225
00:20:12,963 --> 00:20:15,466
You don't wanna check?

226
00:20:15,549 --> 00:20:20,638
Miss Scully, I think you underestimate the
duties and responsibilities of my position...

227
00:20:20,721 --> 00:20:23,140
...as Assistant Director.

228
00:20:25,476 --> 00:20:28,396
I was trying to cooperate
with your investigation.

229
00:20:28,479 --> 00:20:31,148
And enhance your chances
of reinstatement.

230
00:20:31,232 --> 00:20:35,277
- No! I just want answers.
- And so do I!

231
00:20:36,946 --> 00:20:40,783
I wanna know why I was asked to execute
a search warrant on your apartment...

232
00:20:40,866 --> 00:20:43,077
...to look for a digital cassette.

233
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,245
I don't have it.

234
00:20:44,328 --> 00:20:47,373
Is this tape what Agent Mulder died for?

235
00:20:47,456 --> 00:20:48,999
I believe so.

236
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:53,921
You wanna bring me a smoking gun,
Scully, you bring me this tape.

237
00:20:54,004 --> 00:20:58,968
Otherwise I would ask you to go home,
sit tight, and let us do ourjob.

238
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:04,640
Is that all, sir?

239
00:21:07,184 --> 00:21:09,311
Yes, that's all.

240
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:28,456
Did you ask her about the tape?

241
00:21:28,873 --> 00:21:31,083
She says she doesn't have it.

242
00:21:31,167 --> 00:21:33,252
Is that what she says?

243
00:21:34,295 --> 00:21:36,797
Yes, that's what she says.

244
00:21:38,632 --> 00:21:41,302
Well, that's unfortunate for everyone.

245
00:21:56,650 --> 00:21:57,693
Back again?

246
00:21:57,776 --> 00:22:01,280
I'm curious about something.
Can I go through here again?

247
00:22:01,363 --> 00:22:03,324
Come on through.

248
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:07,411
<i>(Dew)</i>

249
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:12,333
This thing is more sensitive
than a toothache.

250
00:22:12,416 --> 00:22:16,003
Would you mind running the wand
over me one more time?

251
00:22:16,086 --> 00:22:17,838
Sure.

252
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:24,094

- No. Not today.

254
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,392
Then what the hell <i>is</i> that?

255
00:22:42,196 --> 00:22:47,326
- What do you think it could be?
- I don't know. It's embedded in soft tissue.

256
00:22:47,618 --> 00:22:50,204
Looks like maybe a piece of buckshot.

257
00:22:50,454 --> 00:22:53,707
I don't know how it could've gotten there.

258
00:22:55,543 --> 00:22:58,128
I can feel it just under the skin.

259
00:22:58,212 --> 00:23:01,924
And now that I'm looking at it closely,
there's a tiny scar over it.

260
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:05,719
If you want,
I could do a local and pull it out of there.

261
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:07,888
Yeah.

262
00:23:12,685 --> 00:23:15,062
Thanks for coming down here so late.

263
00:23:15,145 --> 00:23:20,943
No problem. You were probably wounded
in the line of duty and didn't even know it.

264
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:34,290
<i>For three days the Blessing Way chant
was performed.</i>

<i>The FBI man suffered great fevers...</i>

266
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:40,129
<i>...and his body burned like fire.</i>

267
00:23:40,212 --> 00:23:43,007
<i>There was doubt that he would recover.</i>

268
00:23:43,132 --> 00:23:46,218
<i>But the spirits were in attendance.</i>

269
00:23:46,302 --> 00:23:52,141
<i>Because, on the night of the third day,
he opened his eyes and asked for water.</i>

270
00:23:56,478 --> 00:24:01,191
<i>The ritual bath must be given
outside the hogan before sunrise.</i>

271
00:24:02,151 --> 00:24:07,072
<i>The FBI man was weak from his journey
and did not wish to speak.</i>

272
00:24:07,489 --> 00:24:11,327
<i>But, like a rising sun,
I sensed in him a rebirth.</i>

273
00:24:13,037 --> 00:24:17,333
<i>Still, it will take time to regain his strength.</i>

274
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:25,049
Well...

275
00:24:25,174 --> 00:24:27,551
...it's definitely not buckshot.

276
00:24:28,719 --> 00:24:32,348
I, uh...
I know what it looks like to me, but, uh...

277
00:24:32,431 --> 00:24:35,893
...I couldn't tell you how it got there.
Take a look.

278
00:24:43,942 --> 00:24:46,111
It looks like a computer chip.

279
00:24:47,196 --> 00:24:49,698
That's what it looks like.

280
00:24:51,033 --> 00:24:54,453
I don't even know
how long it's been in there.

281
00:24:54,578 --> 00:24:58,415
I have absolutely no recollection
of it being put there.

282
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,584
God, it's frightening!

283
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:05,172
Dana, this is very serious.
You gotta find out what this is.

284
00:25:05,255 --> 00:25:08,092
I don't have access to the FBI labs.

285
00:25:08,884 --> 00:25:11,595
I'm talking about access
to your own memory.

286
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,848
You've buried this so deeply,
you can't consciously recall it.

287
00:25:14,932 --> 00:25:16,725
- Melissa...
- I know someone...

288
00:25:16,809 --> 00:25:18,477
No!

289
00:25:22,898 --> 00:25:27,653
What are you so afraid of, Dana? That
you might learn something about yourself?

290
00:25:27,736 --> 00:25:32,157
You're so shut off to the possibility
there could be any other explanation...

291
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:35,703
...except for your rigid,
scientific view of the world.

292
00:25:35,786 --> 00:25:39,873
It's like you've lost all touch
with your own intuition.

293
00:25:39,957 --> 00:25:45,963
You carry so much grief and fear that you've
built up walls around your true feelings...

294
00:25:46,088 --> 00:25:49,258
...and the memory of what really happened.

295
00:25:50,259 --> 00:25:53,929
Just do this for me, as your sister.

296
00:25:54,012 --> 00:25:56,098
Please.

297
00:26:05,315 --> 00:26:07,693
I'll induce a non-ordinary state...

298
00:26:07,818 --> 00:26:12,614
...a modified form of hypnosis
which involves Holotropic Breathwork.

299
00:26:12,698 --> 00:26:16,660
This will quiet your interpretive mind
so we can cut through the interference...

300
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:18,912
...with your memories and perceptions.

301
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:23,333
Now, what I want you to do
is to maintain a focus on your breath.

302
00:26:24,042 --> 00:26:26,170
Relax your breathing.

303
00:26:27,004 --> 00:26:29,631
Now I want you to close your eyes...

304
00:26:29,715 --> 00:26:34,052
...and think of a place where
you've always felt comfortable...

305
00:26:34,178 --> 00:26:35,929
...and safe.

306
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:41,351
You told me of your experience
of being taken away and losing time.

307
00:26:41,477 --> 00:26:43,979
Do you remember how you felt
just before this happened?

308
00:26:44,062 --> 00:26:46,023
I was afraid.

309
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:50,360
Do you remember what you were afraid of?

310
00:26:54,531 --> 00:26:56,158
That I would die.

311
00:26:56,366 --> 00:26:58,494
But you didn't die.

312
00:26:58,911 --> 00:27:03,499
Someone must have cared for you.
Do you remember who that someone was?

313
00:27:03,582 --> 00:27:05,542
There were men.

314
00:27:07,044 --> 00:27:09,588
A man took me.

315
00:27:11,882 --> 00:27:14,551
There was a light and...

316
00:27:16,512 --> 00:27:19,056
...loud sounds. My, um...

317
00:27:20,933 --> 00:27:25,354
- My ears were pounding.
- They performed a procedure on you.

318
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:29,233
- Do you remember any pain during this?
- I'm trying...

319
00:27:31,068 --> 00:27:33,695
The sound is all screwed up.

320
00:27:36,698 --> 00:27:39,201
There was an alarm.

321
00:27:40,494 --> 00:27:42,579
I remember, um...

322
00:27:44,957 --> 00:27:47,793
They wanted to know if I was all right.

323
00:27:47,918 --> 00:27:52,422
Maybe you trusted them not to hurt you.
Could this be possible?

324
00:27:54,550 --> 00:27:56,885
I don't know.

325
00:27:56,969 --> 00:28:01,807
At the FBI you work with people
you must entrust with your life.

326
00:28:01,932 --> 00:28:04,685
Could it have been one of these people?

327
00:28:04,768 --> 00:28:07,271
I had to trust them...

328
00:28:09,481 --> 00:28:11,608
I was powerless.

329
00:28:15,612 --> 00:28:17,656
I couldn't...

330
00:28:19,992 --> 00:28:22,160
I could not resist them.

331
00:28:22,953 --> 00:28:28,625
If this is too painful, I want you to go back
to that comfortable place where we began...

332
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,628
- ...and try again.
- Uh! No!

333
00:28:32,796 --> 00:28:35,173
I'm sorry.

334
00:28:35,299 --> 00:28:37,342
I'm trying, I'm trying.

335
00:28:39,803 --> 00:28:42,764
I don't think this is working.

336
00:28:43,432 --> 00:28:46,518
I don't think we're getting anywhere.

337
00:28:48,645 --> 00:28:51,982
Thank you, but you'll have to excuse me.

338
00:29:32,648 --> 00:29:36,860
You must be careful now
to end the ceremony properly.

339
00:29:36,944 --> 00:29:43,325
If you leave, you must not do any work,
change clothes, or bathe for four days.

340
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:46,286
That's gonna cut into my social life.

341

342
00:29:48,914 --> 00:29:50,707
The boys have a gift for you.

343
00:30:08,016 --> 00:30:11,520
You asked for them
during your worst fevers.

344
00:30:15,565 --> 00:30:19,945
During my fever,
I... I left here and travelled to a place.

345
00:30:20,404 --> 00:30:25,534
This place.
You carry it with you. It is inside of you.

346
00:30:25,617 --> 00:30:27,494
It is the origin place.

347
00:30:27,577 --> 00:30:29,329
It wasn't a dream?

348
00:30:29,413 --> 00:30:30,789
Yes.

349
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:51,560
We are done now.

350

<i>(Scully) You came to see me today.</i>

353
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:17,836
Excuse me?

354
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:22,591
You came to my apartment.
I assume you wanted to see me.

355
00:31:22,674 --> 00:31:26,762
<i>- I don't know what you're talking about.</i>
- I <i>saw you come out of my building.</i>

356
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:30,265
You've obviously made a mistake. I'm sorry.

357
00:31:37,189 --> 00:31:40,192
I need some air. Excuse me.

358
00:31:48,658 --> 00:31:52,370
<i>(Mulder) I have been on the bridge
that spans two worlds,</i> ...

359
00:31:52,496 --> 00:31:57,667
<i>...the link between all souls by which
we cross into our own true nature.</i>

360
00:31:58,168 --> 00:32:01,963
You were here today,
looking for a truth that was taken from you.

361
00:32:02,047 --> 00:32:05,592
A truth which was never to be spoken
but which now binds us together...

362
00:32:05,675 --> 00:32:08,011
...in dangerous purpose.

363
00:32:08,136 --> 00:32:11,139
I have returned from the dead
to continue with you.

364
00:32:11,223 --> 00:32:16,186
But I fear that this danger is now
close at hand. That I may be too late.

365
00:32:29,991 --> 00:32:33,620
So we are here to mourn
the passing of William Mulder.

366
00:32:33,703 --> 00:32:36,289
To join in our grief for our loss.

367
00:32:36,373 --> 00:32:41,002
To share also the memories of a man
whose life was rich and full...

368
00:32:41,086 --> 00:32:46,508
...and who made his family's and his
friends' lives richer and fuller as well.

369
00:32:46,591 --> 00:32:51,179
Sadly, I've been informed today
by the mother of William's children...

370
00:32:51,263 --> 00:32:56,560
...that his son, Fox, could not be here
to join us in this time of sorrow.

371
00:33:04,901 --> 00:33:07,112
- Mrs Mulder?
- Yes.

372
00:33:07,237 --> 00:33:09,906
I'm Dana Scully. I work with your son.

373
00:33:09,990 --> 00:33:11,741
Um...

374
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:15,370
I know what you may have heard
from the FBI...

375
00:33:15,453 --> 00:33:18,623
...but I have a strong feeling
your son is going to be found.

376
00:33:18,748 --> 00:33:20,667
Oh, my goodness gracious!

377
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:24,004
- I think he's still alive.
- How do you know?

378
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:28,216
I just have a very strong feeling.

379
00:33:44,107 --> 00:33:49,321
- I'll let you know as soon as I do.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

380
00:33:59,581 --> 00:34:01,249
Hello.

381
00:34:01,333 --> 00:34:04,211
I see you're a friend of the family.

382
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:06,046
So am I.

383
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:08,548
Do you think we might speak?

384
00:34:08,632 --> 00:34:11,927
- About?
- A very serious matter.

385
00:34:12,636 --> 00:34:16,097
Please, can we find someplace
away from the others?

386
00:34:20,936 --> 00:34:23,897
I couldn't help overhearing
your conversation.

387
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,734
- You think the son is still alive?
- Who are you?

388
00:34:27,817 --> 00:34:32,405
I'm a member of a kind of consortium.
We represent certain global interests.

389
00:34:32,572 --> 00:34:33,990
What kind of interests?

390
00:34:34,074 --> 00:34:39,287
Interests that would be threatened by
the tape you are no longer in possession of.

391
00:34:39,537 --> 00:34:42,374
- Threatened enough to murder?
- Oh my, yes!

392
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:47,921
- What do you know about Mulder?
- That he is dead. Cui bono.

393
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:50,548
- You're lying.
- I'm not here to tell you lies.

394
00:34:50,799 --> 00:34:54,552
- What are you here for?
- To tell you your life is in danger too.

395
00:34:56,221 --> 00:34:59,849
- Leave me alone.
- They'll kill you one of two ways.

396
00:35:01,393 --> 00:35:04,020
They'll send someone, possibly two men.

397
00:35:04,145 --> 00:35:07,983
They'll kill you at home
with an unregistered weapon,

398
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:09,609
which will be left at the scene.

399
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:12,779
Using false documents,
supplied by associates of mine...

400
00:35:12,862 --> 00:35:16,574
...they'll be out of the country
in less than two hours.

401
00:35:17,367 --> 00:35:19,786
- You said there were two ways.
- Yes.

402
00:35:19,869 --> 00:35:24,791
He, or she, will be someone close to you.
Someone you trust.

403
00:35:25,333 --> 00:35:28,420
They'll arrange a meeting or come
to your house unexpectedly.

404
00:35:28,545 --> 00:35:31,881
Do you have someplace else
you might stay?

405
00:35:32,716 --> 00:35:36,428
- Why? Why kill me?
- You want something they don't.

406
00:35:36,511 --> 00:35:37,887
Jusfice.

407
00:35:37,971 --> 00:35:43,685
And because they are now certain you don't
have the copy of the files they're looking for.

408
00:35:43,768 --> 00:35:46,313
Why are you protecting me?

409
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:50,859
I feel my colleagues are acting impulsively.

410
00:35:51,735 --> 00:35:55,989
Your death will draw unnecessary
attention to our group.

411
00:35:56,072 --> 00:36:00,160
- You're protecting yourself.
- Why should that surprise you?

412
00:36:00,243 --> 00:36:03,621
Motives are rarely unselfish.

413
00:36:03,747 --> 00:36:08,126
- What kind of business are you in?
- We predict the future.

414
00:36:08,251 --> 00:36:10,754
The best way to predict the future...

415
00:36:10,879 --> 00:36:12,714
...is to invent it.

416
00:36:14,799 --> 00:36:16,968
Good day, young lady.

417
00:36:42,452 --> 00:36:44,162
Mom...

418
00:36:45,538 --> 00:36:47,624
My God!

419
00:36:48,166 --> 00:36:50,085
Fox!

420
00:36:51,086 --> 00:36:54,297
I can't believe it. I'd expected the worst.

421
00:36:54,422 --> 00:36:57,842
I need your help, Mom.
I don't have much time.

422
00:36:57,926 --> 00:37:00,095
They said something terrible had happened.

423
00:37:00,178 --> 00:37:01,763
I'm OK.

424
00:37:01,971 --> 00:37:05,683
But I need your help.
I need you to remember.

425
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:09,270
I need to know more about Dad.

426
00:37:10,605 --> 00:37:12,649
Who these people are.

427
00:37:14,984 --> 00:37:16,945
It was all so long ago.

428
00:37:17,028 --> 00:37:19,572
I need you to try to remember, Mom.

429
00:37:19,656 --> 00:37:22,992
These pictures were taken in 1972. Where?

430
00:37:24,536 --> 00:37:26,704
I don't know.

431
00:37:26,830 --> 00:37:30,417
Dad worked for the State Department.
He'd go on the road. Where?

432
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:34,129
- I don't remember, Fox. Please!
- Look at the pictures, Mom!

433
00:37:34,212 --> 00:37:36,089
- Don't do this to me!
- Look at them!

434
00:37:36,172 --> 00:37:40,844
He must have talked about the men
he worked with. Were they ever here?

435
00:37:41,845 --> 00:37:43,888
Yes.

436
00:37:44,013 --> 00:37:47,600
But I don't remember their names any more.

437
00:37:47,684 --> 00:37:50,478
What does this have to do with, Fox?

438
00:37:54,315 --> 00:37:56,860
I think it has to do with Samantha.

439
00:37:58,361 --> 00:38:02,240
I think it has to do with
what happened to my sister.
